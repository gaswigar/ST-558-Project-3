chapter
i
sometimes
when
i
think
of
my
past
in
a
superficial
casual
way
the
metamorphosis
i
have
gone
through
strikes
me
as
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
i
was
born
and
reared
in
the
lowest
depths
of
poverty
and
i
arrived
in
america
in
with
four
cents
in
my
pocket
i
am
now
worth
more
than
two
million
dollars
and
recognized
as
one
of
the
two
or
three
leading
men
in
the
trade
in
the
united
states
and
yet
when
i
take
a
look
at
my
inner
identity
it
impresses
me
as
being
precisely
the
same
as
it
was
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
my
present
station
power
the
amount
of
worldly
happiness
at
my
command
and
the
rest
of
it
seem
to
be
devoid
of
significance
when
i
was
young
i
used
to
think
that
people
recalled
their
youth
as
something
seen
through
a
haze
i
know
better
now
life
is
much
shorter
than
i
imagined
it
to
be
the
last
years
that
i
spent
in
my
native
land
and
my
first
years
in
america
come
back
to
me
with
the
distinctness
of
yesterday
indeed
i
have
a
better
recollection
of
many
a
trifle
of
my
childhood
days
than
i
have
of
some
important
things
that
occurred
to
me
recently
i
have
a
good
memory
for
faces
but
i
am
apt
to
recognize
people
i
have
not
seen
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
more
readily
than
i
do
some
i
used
to
know
only
a
few
years
ago
i
love
to
brood
over
my
youth
the
dearest
days
in
one
life
are
those
that
seem
very
far
and
very
near
at
once
my
wretched
boyhood
appeals
to
me
as
a
sick
child
does
to
its
mother
i
was
born
in
antomir
in
the
northwestern
region
russia
in
all
i
remember
of
my
father
is
his
tawny
beard
a
huge
yellow
apple
he
once
gave
me
at
the
gate
of
an
orchard
where
he
was
employed
as
watchman
and
the
candle
which
burned
at
his
head
his
body
lay
under
a
white
shroud
on
the
floor
i
was
less
than
three
years
old
when
he
died
so
my
mother
would
carry
me
to
the
synagogue
in
her
arms
to
have
somebody
say
the
prayer
for
the
dead
with
me
i
was
unable
fully
to
realize
the
meaning
of
the
ceremony
of
course
but
its
solemnity
and
pathos
were
not
altogether
lost
upon
me
there
is
a
streak
of
sadness
in
the
blood
of
my
race
very
likely
it
is
of
oriental
origin
if
it
is
it
has
been
amply
nourished
by
many
centuries
of
persecution
left
to
her
own
resources
my
mother
strove
to
support
herself
and
me
by
peddling
pea
mush
or
doing
odds
and
ends
of
jobs
she
had
to
struggle
hard
for
our
scanty
livelihood
and
her
trials
and
loneliness
came
home
to
me
at
an
early
period
i
was
her
all
in
all
though
she
never
poured
over
me
those
torrents
of
senseless
rhapsody
which
i
heard
other
jewish
mothers
shower
over
their
children
the
only
words
of
endearment
i
often
heard
from
her
were
my
little
bean
and
my
comfort
sometimes
when
she
seemed
to
be
crushed
by
the
miseries
of
her
life
she
would
call
me
my
poor
little
orphan
otherwise
it
was
come
here
my
comfort
are
you
hungry
my
little
bean
or
you
are
a
silly
little
dear
my
comfort
these
words
of
hers
and
the
sonorous
contralto
in
which
they
were
uttered
are
ever
alive
in
my
heart
like
the
flame
everlasting
in
a
synagogue
mamma
why
do
you
never
beat
me
like
other
mammas
do
i
once
asked
her
she
laughed
kissed
me
and
said
because
god
has
punished
you
hard
enough
as
it
is
poor
orphan
mine
i
scarcely
remembered
my
father
yet
i
missed
him
keenly
i
was
ever
awake
to
the
fact
that
other
little
boys
had
fathers
and
that
i
was
a
melancholy
exception
that
most
married
women
had
husbands
while
my
mother
had
to
bear
her
burden
unaided
in
my
dim
childish
way
i
knew
that
there
was
a
great
blank
in
our
family
nest
that
it
was
a
widow
nest
and
the
feeling
of
it
seemed
to
color
all
my
other
feelings
when
i
was
a
little
older
and
would
no
longer
sleep
with
my
mother
a
rusty
old
coat
of
my
deceased
father
served
me
as
a
quilt
at
night
before
falling
asleep
i
would
pull
it
over
my
head
shut
my
eyes
tight
and
evoke
a
flow
of
fantastic
shapes
bright
beautifully
tinted
and
incessantly
changing
form
and
color
while
the
play
of
these
figures
and
hues
was
going
on
before
me
i
would
see
all
sorts
of
bizarre
visions
which
at
times
seemed
to
have
something
to
do
with
my
spirit
is
papa
in
heaven
now
is
he
through
with
hell
i
once
inquired
of
my
mother
some
things
or
ideas
would
assume
queer
forms
in
my
mind
god
for
example
appealed
to
me
as
a
beardless
man
wearing
a
quilted
silk
cap
holiness
was
something
burning
forbidding
something
connected
with
fire
while
a
day
had
the
form
of
an
oblong
box
i
was
a
great
dreamer
of
day
dreams
one
of
my
pastimes
was
to
imagine
a
host
of
tiny
soldiers
each
the
size
of
my
little
finger
but
alive
and
real
these
i
would
drill
as
i
saw
officers
do
their
men
in
front
of
the
barracks
some
distance
from
our
home
or
else
i
would
take
to
marching
up
and
down
the
room
with
mother
for
a
rifle
grunting
ferociously
in
russian
left
one
left
one
left
one
in
the
double
capacity
of
a
russian
soldier
and
of
david
fighting
goliath
often
while
bent
upon
her
housework
my
mother
would
hum
some
of
the
songs
of
the
famous
wedding
bard
eliakim
zunzer
who
later
emigrated
to
america
i
distinctly
remember
her
singing
his
there
is
a
flower
on
the
road
decaying
in
the
dust
treading
upon
it
his
summer
and
winter
and
his
rachael
is
bemoaning
her
children
i
vividly
recall
these
brooding
airs
as
she
used
to
sing
them
for
i
have
inherited
her
musical
memory
and
her
passionate
love
for
melody
though
not
her
voice
i
can
not
sing
myself
but
some
tunes
give
me
thrills
of
pleasure
keen
and
terrible
as
the
edge
of
a
sword
some
haunt
me
like
ghosts
but
then
this
is
a
common
trait
among
our
people
she
was
a
wiry
little
woman
my
mother
with
prominent
a
small
firm
mouth
and
dark
eyes
her
hair
was
likewise
dark
though
i
saw
it
but
very
seldom
for
like
all
orthodox
daughters
of
israel
she
always
had
it
carefully
covered
by
a
kerchief
a
nightcap
or
on
saturdays
and
holidays
by
a
wig
she
was
extremely
rigorous
about
it
for
instance
while
she
changed
her
kerchief
for
her
nightcap
she
would
cause
me
to
look
away
my
great
sport
during
my
ninth
and
tenth
years
was
to
play
buttons
these
we
would
fillip
around
on
some
patch
of
unpaved
ground
with
a
little
pit
for
a
billiard
pocket
my
own
pockets
were
usually
full
of
these
buttons
as
the
game
was
restricted
to
brass
ones
from
the
uniforms
of
soldiers
my
mother
had
plenty
to
do
to
keep
those
pockets
of
mine
in
good
repair
to
develop
skill
for
the
sport
i
would
spend
hours
in
some
secluded
spot
secretly
practising
it
by
myself
sometimes
as
i
was
thus
engaged
my
mother
would
seek
me
out
and
bring
me
a
hunk
of
rye
bread
here
she
would
say
gravely
handing
me
it
and
i
would
accept
it
with
preoccupied
mien
take
a
deep
bite
and
go
on
filliping
my
buttons
i
gambled
passionately
and
was
continually
counting
my
treasure
or
running
around
the
big
courtyard
jingling
it
but
one
day
i
suddenly
wearied
of
it
all
and
traded
my
entire
hoard
of
buttons
for
a
and
some
trinkets
do
you
care
for
buttons
any
more
mother
inquired
i
ca
bear
the
sight
of
them
i
replied
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
smilingly
and
called
me
queer
fellow
sometimes
i
would
fall
to
kissing
her
passionately
once
after
an
outburst
of
this
kind
i
said
are
people
sorry
for
us
mamma
what
do
you
mean
because
i
have
no
papa
and
we
have
no
money
antomir
which
then
boasted
eighty
thousand
inhabitants
was
a
town
in
which
a
few
thousand
rubles
was
considered
wealth
and
we
were
among
the
humblest
and
poorest
in
it
the
bulk
of
the
population
lived
on
less
than
fifty
copecks
cents
a
day
and
that
was
difficult
to
earn
a
hunk
of
rye
bread
and
a
bit
of
herring
or
cheese
constituted
a
meal
a
quarter
of
a
copeck
an
eighth
of
a
cent
was
a
coin
with
which
one
purchased
a
few
crumbs
of
or
some
boiled
water
for
tea
rubbers
were
worn
by
people
of
means
only
i
never
saw
any
in
the
district
in
which
my
mother
and
i
had
our
home
a
white
starched
collar
was
an
attribute
of
aristocracy
children
had
to
nag
their
mothers
for
a
piece
of
bread
mamma
i
want
a
piece
of
bread
with
a
mild
whimper
again
bread
you
eat
my
head
off
may
the
worms
eat
you
dialogues
such
as
this
were
heard
at
every
turn
my
boyhood
recollections
include
the
following
episode
mother
once
sent
me
to
a
tinker
shop
to
have
our
repaired
it
was
a
plain
tin
affair
and
must
have
cost
when
new
something
like
four
or
five
cents
it
had
done
service
as
long
as
i
could
remember
it
was
quite
rusty
and
finally
sprang
a
leak
and
so
i
took
it
to
the
tinker
or
tinsmith
who
soldered
it
up
on
my
way
home
i
slipped
and
fell
whereupon
the
cup
hit
a
cobblestone
and
sprang
a
new
leak
when
my
mother
discovered
the
damage
she
made
me
tell
the
story
of
the
accident
over
and
over
again
wringing
her
hands
and
sighing
as
she
listened
the
average
mother
in
our
town
would
have
given
me
a
whipping
in
the
circumstances
she
did
not
chapter
ii
we
lived
in
a
deep
basement
in
a
large
dusky
room
that
we
shared
with
three
other
families
each
family
occupying
one
of
the
corners
and
as
much
space
as
it
was
able
to
wrest
violent
quarrels
were
a
commonplace
occurrence
and
the
question
of
floor
space
a
staple
bone
of
contention
the
huge
brick
oven
in
which
the
four
housewives
cooked
dinner
was
another
prolific
source
of
strife
fights
over
pots
were
as
frequent
and
as
truculent
as
those
over
the
children
of
our
i
best
recall
a
bookbinder
and
a
retired
old
soldier
who
mended
old
sheepskin
coats
for
a
living
my
memories
of
home
are
inseparable
from
the
odors
of
sheepskin
and
paste
and
the
image
of
two
upright
wooden
screws
the
bookbinder
machine
the
soldier
had
finished
his
term
of
military
service
years
before
yet
he
still
wore
his
uniform
a
dilapidated
black
coat
with
new
brass
buttons
and
a
similar
overcoat
of
a
coarse
gray
material
also
he
still
shaved
his
chin
sporting
a
pair
of
formidable
gray
shaving
is
one
of
the
worst
sins
known
to
our
faith
but
somehow
people
overlooked
it
in
one
who
had
once
been
compelled
to
practise
it
in
the
army
otherwise
the
furrier
or
sheepskin
tailor
was
an
extremely
pious
man
he
was
very
kind
to
me
so
that
his
military
whiskers
never
awed
me
not
so
his
lame
tall
wife
who
often
hit
me
with
one
of
her
crutches
she
was
the
bane
of
my
life
the
bookbinder
wife
was
much
younger
than
her
husband
and
one
of
the
things
i
often
heard
was
that
he
was
crazy
for
her
because
she
is
his
second
wife
from
which
i
inferred
that
second
wives
were
loved
far
more
than
first
ones
the
bookbinder
had
a
little
girl
whom
i
hated
like
poison
red
esther
we
called
her
to
distinguish
her
from
a
black
esther
whose
home
was
on
the
same
yard
she
was
full
of
fight
knowing
how
repulsive
she
was
to
me
she
was
often
the
first
to
open
hostilities
mocking
my
way
of
speaking
or
sticking
out
her
tongue
at
me
or
else
she
would
press
her
freckled
cheek
against
my
lips
and
then
dodge
back
shouting
gloatingly
he
has
kissed
a
girl
he
has
kissed
a
girl
sinner
shame
sinner
sinner
there
were
some
other
things
that
she
or
some
of
the
other
little
girls
of
our
courtyard
would
do
to
make
an
involuntary
sinner
of
me
but
these
had
better
be
left
out
i
had
many
a
fierce
duel
with
her
i
was
considered
a
strong
boy
but
she
was
quick
and
nimble
as
a
cat
and
i
usually
got
the
worst
of
the
bargain
often
being
left
badly
scratched
and
bleeding
at
which
point
the
combat
would
be
taken
up
by
our
mothers
the
room
part
of
which
was
our
home
and
two
other
apartments
similarly
tenanted
opened
into
a
vestibule
which
my
fancy
peopled
with
evil
ones
a
steep
stairway
led
up
to
the
yard
part
of
which
was
occupied
by
a
huddle
of
ramshackle
houses
it
was
known
as
abner
court
during
the
summer
months
it
swarmed
with
tattered
unkempt
humanity
there
was
a
peculiar
odor
to
the
place
which
i
can
still
smell
indeed
many
of
the
things
that
i
conjure
up
from
the
past
appeal
as
much
to
my
sense
of
smell
as
to
my
visual
memory
it
was
anything
but
a
grateful
odor
the
far
end
of
our
street
was
part
of
a
squalid
little
suburb
known
as
the
sands
it
was
inhabited
by
gentiles
exclusively
sometimes
when
a
jew
chanced
to
visit
it
some
of
its
boys
would
descend
upon
him
with
shouts
of
damned
jew
and
sick
their
dogs
at
him
as
we
had
no
dogs
to
defend
us
orthodox
jews
being
prohibited
from
keeping
these
domestic
animals
by
a
custom
amounting
to
a
religious
injunction
our
boys
never
ventured
into
the
place
except
perhaps
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
one
day
the
bigger
jewish
boys
of
our
street
had
a
pitched
battle
with
the
sands
boys
an
event
which
is
one
of
the
landmarks
in
the
history
of
my
childhood
still
some
of
the
sands
boys
were
on
terms
of
friendship
with
us
and
would
even
come
to
play
with
us
in
our
yard
the
only
gentile
family
that
lived
in
abner
court
was
that
of
the
porter
his
children
spoke
fairly
good
yiddish
one
saturday
evening
a
lad
from
the
sands
the
son
of
a
meeting
me
in
the
street
set
his
dog
at
me
as
a
result
i
came
home
with
a
piece
of
my
trousers
were
unknown
to
us
missing
i
going
to
kill
him
my
mother
said
with
something
like
a
sob
i
just
going
to
kill
him
cool
down
the
retired
soldier
pleaded
without
removing
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
mother
was
silent
for
a
minute
and
even
seated
herself
but
presently
she
sprang
to
her
feet
again
and
made
for
the
door
the
soldier
wife
seized
her
by
an
arm
where
are
you
going
to
the
sands
are
you
crazy
if
you
start
a
quarrel
over
there
you
never
come
back
alive
i
do
care
she
wrenched
herself
free
and
left
the
room
half
an
hour
later
she
came
back
beaming
his
father
is
a
lovely
gentile
she
said
he
went
out
brought
his
murderer
of
a
boy
home
took
off
his
belt
and
skinned
him
alive
a
good
gentile
the
soldier
wife
commented
admiringly
there
was
always
a
pile
of
logs
somewhere
in
our
court
the
property
of
some
family
that
was
to
have
it
cut
up
for
firewood
this
was
our
great
of
a
summer
evening
here
we
would
bandy
stories
often
of
our
own
inventing
or
discuss
things
the
leading
topic
of
conversation
being
the
soldiers
of
the
two
regiments
that
were
stationed
in
our
town
we
saw
a
good
deal
of
these
soldiers
and
we
could
tell
their
officers
commissioned
or
by
the
number
of
stars
or
bands
on
their
also
we
knew
the
names
of
their
generals
colonels
and
some
of
their
majors
or
captains
the
more
important
manoeuvers
took
place
a
great
distance
from
court
but
that
did
not
matter
if
they
occurred
on
a
saturday
when
we
were
free
from
school
and
as
good
luck
would
have
it
they
usually
did
many
of
us
myself
invariably
included
would
go
to
see
them
the
blare
of
trumpets
the
beat
of
drums
the
playing
of
the
band
the
rhythmic
clatter
of
thousands
of
feet
the
glint
of
rows
and
rows
of
bayonets
the
red
or
the
blue
of
the
uniforms
the
commanding
officer
on
his
mount
the
spirited
singing
of
the
men
marching
back
to
barracks
all
this
would
literally
hold
me
spellbound
that
we
often
played
soldiers
goes
without
saying
but
we
played
hares
more
often
a
game
in
which
the
counting
was
done
by
means
of
senseless
words
like
the
american
eeny
meeny
miny
moe
sometimes
we
would
play
war
with
the
names
of
the
belligerents
borrowed
from
the
old
testament
and
once
in
a
while
we
would
have
a
real
war
with
the
boys
of
the
next
street
i
was
accounted
one
of
the
strong
fellows
among
the
boys
of
abner
court
as
well
as
one
of
the
conspicuous
figures
among
them
compactly
built
with
a
small
firm
mouth
like
my
mother
a
nose
and
large
dark
eyes
i
was
not
a
homely
boy
by
any
means
nor
one
devoid
of
a
certain
kind
of
magnetism
one
of
my
recollections
is
of
my
mother
administering
a
to
a
married
young
woman
whom
she
had
discovered
flirting
in
the
dark
vestibule
with
a
man
not
her
husband
a
few
minutes
later
the
young
woman
came
in
and
begged
my
mother
not
to
tell
her
husband
if
i
was
your
husband
i
would
skin
you
alive
oh
do
tell
him
take
pity
do
i
wo
get
out
of
here
you
lump
of
stench
oh
swear
that
you
wo
tell
him
do
swear
dearie
long
life
to
you
health
to
every
little
bone
of
yours
first
you
swear
that
you
never
do
it
again
you
heap
of
dung
strike
me
blind
and
dumb
and
deaf
if
i
ever
do
it
again
there
your
oaths
are
worth
no
more
than
the
barking
of
a
dog
you
be
decent
you
ought
to
be
knouted
in
the
you
are
a
plague
black
luck
upon
you
get
away
from
me
but
i
will
be
decent
may
i
break
both
my
legs
and
both
my
arms
if
i
am
not
do
swear
that
you
wo
tell
him
my
mother
yielded
she
was
passionately
devout
my
mother
being
absolutely
illiterate
she
would
murmur
meaningless
words
in
the
singsong
of
a
prayer
pretending
to
herself
that
she
was
performing
her
devotions
this
however
she
would
do
with
absolute
earnestness
and
fervor
often
with
tears
of
ecstasy
coming
to
her
eyes
to
be
sure
she
knew
how
to
bless
the
sabbath
candles
and
to
recite
the
two
or
three
other
brief
prayers
that
our
religion
exacts
from
married
women
but
she
was
not
contented
with
it
and
the
sight
of
a
woman
going
to
synagogue
with
a
huge
under
her
arm
was
ever
a
source
of
envy
to
her
most
of
the
tenants
of
the
court
were
good
people
honest
and
pure
but
there
were
exceptions
of
these
my
memory
has
retained
the
face
of
a
man
who
was
known
as
carrot
pudding
moe
a
finger
worker
a
specialist
in
short
change
yardstick
frauds
and
other
varieties
of
legerdemain
one
woman
a
cross
between
a
beggar
and
a
dealer
in
dresses
had
four
sons
all
of
whom
were
pickpockets
but
she
herself
was
said
to
be
of
spotless
honesty
she
never
allowed
them
to
enter
abner
court
though
every
time
one
of
them
was
in
prison
she
would
visit
him
and
bring
him
food
nor
were
professional
beggars
barred
from
the
court
as
tenants
indeed
one
of
our
neighbors
was
a
regular
recipient
of
alms
at
the
hands
of
my
mother
for
poor
as
she
was
she
seldom
let
a
friday
pass
without
distributing
a
few
an
eighth
of
a
cent
in
charity
the
amusing
part
of
it
was
the
fact
that
one
of
the
beggars
on
her
list
was
far
better
off
than
she
he
old
and
lame
and
no
hypocrite
like
the
rest
of
them
she
would
explain
she
had
a
ferocious
temper
but
there
were
people
myself
among
them
with
whom
she
was
never
irritated
the
women
of
court
were
either
her
devoted
followers
or
her
bitter
enemies
she
was
a
leader
in
most
of
the
feuds
that
often
divided
the
whole
court
into
two
warring
camps
and
in
those
exceptional
cases
when
she
happened
to
be
neutral
she
was
an
ardent
peacemaker
she
wore
a
kerchief
which
was
older
than
i
and
almost
invariably
when
there
was
a
crowd
of
women
in
the
yard
that
kerchief
would
loom
in
its
center
growing
as
i
did
in
that
crowded
basement
room
which
was
the
home
of
four
families
it
was
inevitable
that
the
secrets
of
sex
should
be
revealed
to
me
before
i
was
able
fully
to
appreciate
their
meaning
then
too
the
neighborhood
was
not
of
the
purest
in
town
located
a
short
distance
from
abner
court
midway
between
it
and
the
barracks
was
a
lane
of
ill
repute
usually
full
of
soldiers
if
it
had
an
official
name
i
never
heard
it
it
was
generally
referred
to
as
that
street
in
a
subdued
voice
that
was
suggestive
either
of
shame
and
disgust
or
of
waggish
mirth
for
a
long
time
i
was
under
the
impression
that
that
was
simply
the
name
of
the
street
one
summer
day
i
must
have
been
eight
years
old
i
told
my
mother
that
i
had
peeked
in
one
of
the
little
yards
of
the
mysterious
lane
that
i
had
seen
women
and
soldiers
there
and
that
one
of
the
women
had
beckoned
me
in
and
given
me
some
cake
why
you
must
do
that
davie
she
said
aghast
do
you
ever
go
near
that
street
again
do
you
hear
why
because
it
is
a
bad
street
why
is
it
bad
keep
still
and
do
ask
foolish
questions
i
obeyed
with
the
result
that
the
foolish
questions
kept
rankling
in
my
brain
on
a
subsequent
occasion
when
she
was
combing
my
dark
hair
fondly
i
ventured
once
more
mamma
why
must
i
come
near
that
street
because
it
is
a
sin
to
do
so
my
comfort
fie
upon
it
this
answer
settled
it
one
did
not
ask
why
it
was
a
sin
to
do
this
or
not
to
do
that
you
do
demand
explanations
of
the
master
of
the
world
as
people
were
continually
saying
around
me
my
curiosity
was
silenced
that
street
became
repellent
to
me
something
hideously
wicked
and
sinister
sometimes
some
of
the
excommunicated
women
would
drop
in
at
our
yard
as
a
rule
my
mother
was
bitterly
opposed
to
their
visits
and
she
often
chased
them
out
with
maledictions
and
expressions
of
abhorrence
but
there
was
one
case
in
which
she
showed
unusual
tolerance
and
even
assumed
the
part
of
father
confessor
to
a
woman
of
this
kind
she
would
listen
to
her
tale
of
woe
homesickness
and
repentance
including
some
of
the
most
intimate
details
of
her
loathsome
life
she
would
even
deliver
her
donations
to
the
synagogue
thus
helping
her
cheat
the
biblical
injunction
which
bars
the
gifts
of
fallen
women
from
a
house
of
god
my
mother
would
bid
me
keep
away
during
these
confabs
of
theirs
but
this
only
whetted
my
curiosity
and
i
often
overheard
far
more
than
i
should
fridays
were
with
us
jewish
boys
one
friday
afternoon
a
wedding
was
celebrated
in
our
courtyard
the
procession
emerged
from
one
of
the
rickety
houses
accompanied
by
a
band
playing
a
solemn
tune
when
it
reached
the
center
of
the
vacant
part
of
the
yard
it
came
to
a
halt
and
a
canopy
was
stretched
over
the
principal
figures
of
the
ceremony
prayers
and
benedictions
were
chanted
the
groom
put
the
ring
on
the
bride
finger
dedicating
her
to
himself
according
to
the
laws
of
moses
and
israel
more
prayers
were
recited
the
bridegroom
and
the
bride
received
sips
of
wine
a
plate
was
smashed
the
sound
being
greeted
by
shouts
of
good
luck
good
luck
the
band
struck
up
a
lively
tune
with
a
sad
tang
to
it
the
yard
was
crowded
with
people
it
was
the
greatest
sensation
we
children
had
ever
enjoyed
there
we
remained
out
chattering
of
the
event
till
the
windows
were
aglitter
with
sabbath
lights
i
was
in
a
trance
the
ceremony
was
a
poem
to
me
something
inexpressibly
beautiful
and
sacred
presently
a
boy
somewhat
older
than
i
made
a
jest
at
the
young
couple
expense
what
he
said
was
a
startling
revelation
to
me
certain
things
which
i
had
known
before
suddenly
appeared
in
a
new
light
to
me
i
relished
the
discovery
and
i
relished
the
deviltry
of
it
but
the
poem
vanished
the
beauty
of
the
wedding
i
had
just
witnessed
and
of
weddings
in
general
seemed
to
be
irretrievably
desecrated
that
boy
name
was
naphtali
he
was
a
fellow
with
curly
brown
hair
somewhat
he
was
as
poor
as
the
average
boy
in
the
yard
and
as
poorly
dressed
but
he
was
the
tidiest
of
us
he
would
draw
with
a
piece
of
chalk
figures
of
horses
and
men
which
we
admired
he
knew
things
good
and
bad
and
from
that
friday
i
often
sought
his
company
unlike
most
of
the
other
boys
he
talked
little
throwing
out
his
remarks
at
long
intervals
which
sharpened
my
sense
of
his
wisdom
his
father
never
let
him
attend
the
manoeuvers
yet
he
knew
more
about
soldiers
than
any
of
the
other
boys
more
even
than
i
though
i
had
that
retired
soldier
the
sheepskin
man
to
explain
things
military
to
me
one
summer
evening
naphtali
and
i
sat
on
a
pile
of
logs
in
the
yard
watching
a
boy
who
was
playing
on
a
toy
fiddle
of
his
own
making
i
said
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
play
on
a
real
fiddle
you
naphtali
made
no
answer
after
a
little
he
said
you
must
think
it
is
the
bow
that
does
the
playing
do
you
what
else
does
it
i
asked
perplexed
it
the
fingers
of
the
other
hand
those
that
are
jumping
around
is
it
i
did
not
understand
but
i
was
deeply
impressed
all
the
same
the
question
bothered
me
all
that
evening
finally
i
submitted
it
to
my
mother
mamma
naphtali
says
when
you
play
on
a
fiddle
it
is
not
the
bow
that
makes
the
tune
but
the
fingers
that
are
jumping
around
is
it
true
she
told
me
not
to
bother
her
with
foolish
questions
but
the
retired
soldier
who
had
overheard
my
query
volunteered
to
answer
it
of
course
it
is
not
the
bow
he
said
but
if
you
did
not
work
the
bow
the
strings
would
not
play
would
they
i
urged
you
could
play
a
tune
by
pinching
them
he
answered
but
if
you
just
kept
passing
the
bow
up
and
down
there
would
be
no
tune
at
all
i
plied
him
with
further
questions
and
he
answered
them
all
patiently
and
fondly
illustrating
his
explanations
with
a
thread
for
a
violin
string
my
mother
looking
from
him
to
me
beamingly
when
we
were
through
she
questioned
him
do
you
think
he
understands
it
all
he
certainly
does
he
has
a
good
head
he
answered
with
a
wink
and
she
flushed
with
happiness
chapter
iii
the
tuition
fee
at
a
school
for
religious
instruction
or
cheder
was
from
eight
to
ten
rubles
five
dollars
for
a
term
of
six
months
my
mother
could
not
afford
it
on
the
other
hand
she
would
not
hear
of
sending
me
to
the
free
cheder
of
our
town
because
of
its
reputation
for
poor
instruction
so
she
importuned
and
harassed
two
distant
relatives
of
ours
until
they
agreed
to
raise
part
of
the
sum
between
them
the
payments
were
made
with
anything
but
promptness
the
result
being
that
i
was
often
turned
out
of
school
mother
however
would
lose
no
time
in
bringing
me
back
she
would
implore
the
schoolmaster
to
take
pity
on
the
poor
helpless
woman
that
she
was
assuring
him
with
some
weird
oaths
that
she
would
pay
him
every
penny
if
that
failed
she
would
burst
into
a
flood
of
threats
and
imprecations
daring
him
to
let
a
fatherless
boy
grow
up
in
ignorance
of
the
word
of
god
this
was
followed
by
similar
scenes
at
the
houses
of
my
cousins
until
finally
i
was
allowed
to
resume
my
studies
sometimes
at
the
same
cheder
sometimes
at
some
other
one
there
were
scores
of
such
private
schools
in
our
town
and
before
i
got
through
my
elementary
religious
education
i
had
become
acquainted
with
a
considerable
number
of
them
sometimes
when
a
teacher
or
his
wife
tried
to
oust
me
i
would
clutch
at
the
table
and
struggle
sullenly
until
they
yielded
i
may
explain
that
instruction
in
these
cheders
was
confined
to
the
hebrew
old
testament
and
rudiments
of
the
talmud
the
exercises
lasting
practically
all
day
and
part
of
the
evening
the
was
at
the
same
time
the
bedroom
and
kitchen
of
the
teacher
family
his
wife
and
children
were
always
around
these
cheder
teachers
were
usually
a
lot
with
full
beards
and
voices
hoarse
with
incessant
shouting
a
special
man
generally
came
for
an
hour
to
teach
the
boys
to
write
as
he
was
to
be
paid
separately
i
was
not
included
the
feeling
of
envy
abasement
and
with
which
i
used
to
watch
the
other
boys
ply
their
quills
is
among
the
most
painful
memories
of
my
childhood
during
the
penmanship
lesson
i
was
generally
kept
busy
in
other
directions
the
teacher
wife
would
make
me
help
her
with
her
housework
go
her
errands
or
mind
the
baby
in
one
instance
i
became
so
attached
to
the
baby
that
when
i
was
expelled
i
missed
it
keenly
i
seized
every
opportunity
to
watch
the
boys
write
and
would
practise
the
art
with
chalk
on
my
mother
table
or
bed
on
the
door
of
our
basement
room
on
many
a
gate
or
fence
sometimes
a
boy
would
let
me
write
a
line
or
two
in
his
sometimes
too
i
would
come
to
school
before
the
schoolmaster
had
returned
from
the
morning
service
at
the
synagogue
and
practise
with
pen
and
ink
following
the
copy
of
some
of
my
classmates
one
of
my
teachers
once
caught
me
in
the
act
he
held
me
up
as
an
and
forbade
me
come
to
school
before
the
beginning
of
exercises
otherwise
my
teachers
scarcely
ever
complained
of
my
behavior
as
to
the
progress
i
was
making
in
my
studies
they
admitted
some
even
with
enthusiasm
that
mine
was
a
good
head
nevertheless
to
be
beaten
by
them
was
an
experience
with
me
overworked
underfed
and
goaded
by
the
of
their
wives
these
enervated
drudges
were
usually
out
of
sorts
bursts
of
ill
temper
in
the
form
of
invective
pinching
caning
or
were
part
of
the
routine
and
very
often
i
was
the
scapegoat
for
the
sins
of
other
boys
when
a
pupil
deserved
punishment
and
the
schoolmaster
could
not
afford
to
inflict
it
because
the
culprit
happened
to
be
the
pet
of
a
family
the
teacher
anger
was
almost
sure
to
be
vented
on
me
if
i
happened
to
be
somewhat
the
only
offense
i
was
ever
guilty
of
or
was
not
quick
enough
to
turn
over
a
leaf
or
there
was
the
slightest
halt
in
my
singsong
i
received
a
violent
nudge
or
a
pull
by
the
ear
lively
lively
carcass
you
i
can
almost
hear
one
of
my
teachers
shout
these
words
as
he
digs
his
elbow
into
my
side
the
millions
one
gets
from
your
mother
this
man
would
beat
and
abuse
me
even
by
way
of
expressing
approval
a
bright
fellow
curse
him
he
would
say
punching
me
with
an
air
of
admiration
or
where
did
you
get
those
brains
of
yours
you
wild
beast
with
a
violent
pull
at
my
forelock
during
the
winter
months
when
the
exercises
went
on
until
in
the
evening
the
candle
or
kerosene
was
paid
for
by
the
boys
in
rotation
when
it
was
my
turn
to
furnish
the
light
it
often
happened
that
my
mother
was
unable
to
procure
the
required
two
copecks
one
cent
then
the
teacher
or
his
wife
or
both
would
curse
me
for
a
sponge
and
a
robber
and
ask
me
why
i
did
not
go
to
the
charity
school
almost
every
teacher
in
town
was
known
among
us
boys
by
some
nickname
which
was
usually
borrowed
from
some
trade
if
he
had
a
predilection
for
pulling
a
boy
hair
we
would
call
him
or
if
he
preferred
to
slap
or
calcimine
the
culprit
face
we
would
speak
of
him
as
a
mason
a
coachman
was
a
teacher
who
did
not
spare
the
rod
or
the
whip
a
carpenter
one
who
used
his
finger
as
a
gimlet
boring
a
pupil
side
or
cheek
a
locksmith
one
who
had
a
weakness
for
turning
the
screw
or
pinching
the
greatest
locksmith
in
town
was
a
man
named
shmerl
but
then
he
was
more
often
called
simply
shmerl
the
pincher
he
was
one
of
my
schoolmasters
he
seemed
to
prefer
the
flesh
of
plump
boys
but
as
these
were
usually
the
sons
of
prosperous
parents
he
often
had
to
forego
the
pleasure
and
to
gratify
his
appetite
on
me
there
was
something
morbid
in
his
cruel
passion
for
young
flesh
something
perversely
related
to
sex
perhaps
he
was
a
young
man
with
a
wide
sneering
mouth
he
would
pinch
me
black
and
blue
till
my
heart
contracted
with
pain
yet
i
never
uttered
a
murmur
i
was
too
profoundly
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
was
kept
on
sufferance
to
risk
the
slightest
demonstration
i
had
developed
a
singular
faculty
for
bearing
pain
which
i
would
parade
before
the
other
boys
also
i
had
developed
a
relish
for
flaunting
my
martyrdom
for
being
an
object
of
pity
oh
how
i
did
hate
this
man
especially
his
sneering
mouth
in
my
helplessness
i
would
seek
comfort
in
dreams
of
becoming
a
great
man
some
day
rich
and
mighty
and
avenging
myself
on
him
behold
shmerl
the
pincher
is
running
after
me
cringingly
begging
my
pardon
and
i
omnipotent
and
formidable
say
to
him
do
you
remember
how
you
pinched
the
life
out
of
me
for
nothing
away
with
you
you
cruel
beast
or
i
would
vision
myself
dropping
dead
under
one
of
his
onslaughts
behold
him
trembling
with
fright
the
heartless
wretch
serves
him
right
if
my
body
happened
to
bear
some
mark
of
his
cruelty
i
would
conceal
it
carefully
from
my
mother
lest
she
should
quarrel
with
him
moreover
to
betray
school
secrets
was
considered
a
great
sin
one
night
as
i
was
changing
my
shirt
anxiously
manoeuvering
to
keep
a
certain
spot
on
my
left
arm
out
of
her
sight
she
became
suspicious
hold
on
what
are
you
hiding
there
she
said
stepping
up
and
inspecting
my
bare
arm
she
found
an
ugly
blotch
woe
is
me
a
lamentation
upon
me
she
said
looking
aghast
who
has
been
pinching
you
nobody
it
is
that
beast
of
a
teacher
is
it
no
do
lie
davie
it
is
that
assassin
the
cholera
take
him
tell
me
the
truth
do
be
afraid
a
boy
did
it
what
is
his
name
i
do
know
it
was
a
boy
in
the
street
you
are
a
liar
the
next
morning
when
i
went
to
cheder
she
accompanied
me
arrived
there
she
stripped
me
and
pointing
at
the
discoloration
on
my
arm
she
said
with
ominous
composure
look
whose
work
is
it
mine
shmerl
answered
without
removing
his
pipe
from
his
wide
mouth
he
was
no
coward
and
you
are
proud
of
it
are
you
if
you
do
like
it
you
can
take
your
ornament
of
a
son
along
with
you
clear
out
you
witch
she
flew
at
him
and
they
clenched
when
they
had
separated
some
of
his
hair
was
in
her
hand
while
her
arms
as
she
subsequently
owned
to
me
were
marked
with
the
work
of
his
expert
fingers
another
schoolmaster
had
a
special
predilection
for
digging
the
huge
nail
of
his
thumb
into
the
side
of
his
victim
a
peculiarity
for
which
he
had
been
named
the
cossack
his
famous
thumb
being
referred
to
by
the
boys
as
his
spear
he
had
a
passion
for
inventing
new
and
complex
modes
of
punishment
his
spear
figuring
in
most
of
them
one
of
his
methods
of
inflicting
pain
was
to
slap
the
boy
face
with
one
hand
and
to
prod
his
side
with
the
thumb
of
the
other
the
slaps
and
the
thrusts
alternating
rhythmically
this
heartless
wretch
was
an
abject
coward
he
was
afraid
of
thunder
of
rats
spiders
dogs
and
above
all
of
his
wife
who
would
call
him
indecent
names
in
our
presence
i
abhorred
him
yet
when
he
was
thus
humiliated
i
felt
pity
for
him
his
wife
kept
a
stand
on
a
neighboring
street
corner
where
she
sold
cheap
cakes
and
candy
and
those
of
her
husband
pupils
who
were
on
her
list
of
good
customers
were
sure
of
immunity
from
his
spear
as
i
scarcely
ever
had
a
penny
he
could
safely
beat
me
whenever
he
was
so
disposed
chapter
iv
the
cossack
had
a
large
family
and
one
of
his
daughters
a
little
girl
named
was
the
heroine
of
my
first
romance
had
the
misfortune
to
bear
a
striking
resemblance
to
a
sister
of
her
father
an
offense
which
her
mother
never
forgave
her
she
treated
her
as
she
might
a
stepdaughter
as
for
the
cossack
he
may
have
cared
for
the
child
but
if
he
did
he
dared
not
show
it
poor
little
she
was
the
outcast
of
the
family
just
as
i
was
the
outcast
of
her
father
school
she
was
about
eleven
years
old
and
i
was
somewhat
younger
the
similarity
of
our
fates
and
of
our
drew
us
to
each
other
when
her
father
beat
me
i
was
conscious
of
her
commiserating
look
and
when
she
was
mistreated
by
her
mother
she
would
cast
appealing
glances
in
my
direction
once
when
the
teacher
punished
me
with
special
cruelty
her
face
twitched
and
she
broke
into
a
whimper
whereupon
he
gave
her
a
kick
saying
is
it
any
business
of
yours
thank
god
your
own
skin
has
not
been
peeled
off
once
during
the
lunch
hour
when
we
were
alone
and
i
in
a
corner
of
the
courtyard
she
said
you
are
so
strong
davie
nothing
hurts
you
nothing
at
all
i
could
stand
everything
i
bragged
you
could
not
if
i
bit
your
finger
go
ahead
i
said
with
bravado
holding
out
my
hand
she
dug
her
teeth
into
one
of
my
fingers
it
hurt
so
that
i
involuntarily
ground
my
own
teeth
but
i
smiled
does
it
not
hurt
you
davie
she
asked
with
a
look
of
admiration
not
a
bit
go
on
bite
as
hard
as
you
can
she
did
the
cruel
thing
and
like
many
an
older
heroine
she
would
not
desist
until
she
saw
her
lover
blood
it
still
does
not
hurt
does
it
she
asked
wiping
away
a
red
drop
from
her
lips
i
shook
my
head
contemptuously
when
you
are
a
man
you
will
be
strong
as
samson
the
strong
i
was
the
strongest
boy
in
her
father
school
she
knew
that
most
of
the
other
boys
were
afraid
of
me
but
that
did
not
seem
to
interest
her
at
least
when
i
began
to
boast
of
it
she
returned
to
my
ability
to
stand
punishment
as
the
pugilists
would
put
it
one
day
one
of
my
schoolmates
aroused
her
admiration
by
the
way
he
played
taps
with
his
fist
for
a
trumpet
i
tried
to
imitate
him
but
failed
grievously
the
other
boy
laughed
and
joined
him
that
was
my
first
taste
of
the
bitter
cup
called
jealousy
i
went
home
a
lovelorn
boy
i
took
to
practising
taps
i
was
continually
trumpeting
i
kept
at
it
so
strenuously
that
my
mother
had
many
a
quarrel
with
our
because
of
it
my
efforts
went
for
nothing
however
my
rival
and
with
him
my
lady
love
continued
to
sneer
at
my
performances
i
had
only
one
teacher
who
never
beat
me
or
any
of
the
other
boys
whatever
anger
we
provoked
in
him
would
spend
itself
in
threats
and
even
these
he
often
turned
to
a
joke
in
a
peculiar
vein
of
his
own
if
you
do
behave
i
cut
you
to
pieces
he
would
say
i
just
cut
you
to
tiny
bits
and
put
you
into
my
pipe
and
you
go
up
in
smoke
or
i
give
you
such
a
thrashing
that
you
wo
be
able
to
sit
down
stand
up
or
lie
down
the
only
thing
you
be
able
to
do
is
to
fly
to
the
devil
this
teacher
used
me
as
a
living
advertisement
for
his
school
he
would
take
me
from
house
to
house
flaunting
my
recitations
and
interpretations
very
often
the
passage
which
he
thus
made
me
read
was
a
lesson
i
had
studied
under
one
of
his
predecessors
but
i
never
gave
him
away
every
cheder
had
its
king
as
a
rule
it
was
the
richest
boy
in
the
school
but
i
was
usually
the
power
behind
the
throne
once
one
of
these
potentates
it
was
at
the
school
of
that
kindly
man
mimicked
my
mother
hugging
her
pot
of
pea
mush
if
you
do
it
again
i
kill
you
i
said
if
you
lay
a
finger
on
me
he
retorted
the
teacher
will
kick
you
out
your
mother
does
pay
him
anyhow
i
flew
at
him
his
majesty
tearfully
begged
for
mercy
since
then
he
was
under
my
thumb
and
never
omitted
to
share
his
rolls
or
apples
with
me
often
when
a
boy
ate
something
that
was
beyond
my
means
a
cookie
or
a
slice
of
buttered
white
bread
i
would
eye
him
enviously
till
he
complained
that
i
made
him
choke
then
i
would
go
on
eying
him
until
he
bribed
me
off
with
a
piece
of
the
tidbit
if
staring
alone
proved
futile
i
might
try
to
bring
him
to
terms
by
naming
all
sorts
of
loathsome
objects
at
this
it
frequently
happened
that
the
prosperous
boy
threw
away
his
cookie
from
sheer
disgust
whereupon
i
would
be
mean
enough
to
pick
it
up
and
to
eat
it
in
triumph
calling
him
something
equivalent
to
sissy
the
compliments
that
were
paid
my
brains
were
ample
compensation
for
my
mother
struggles
sending
me
to
work
was
out
of
the
question
she
was
resolved
to
put
me
in
a
talmudic
seminary
i
was
the
crown
of
her
head
and
she
was
going
to
make
a
fine
jew
of
me
nor
was
she
a
rare
exception
in
this
respect
for
there
were
hundreds
of
other
poor
families
in
our
town
who
would
starve
themselves
to
keep
their
sons
studying
the
word
of
god
whenever
one
of
the
neighbors
suggested
that
i
be
apprenticed
to
some
artisan
she
would
flare
up
on
one
occasion
a
suggestion
of
this
kind
led
to
a
violent
quarrel
one
afternoon
when
we
happened
to
pass
by
a
bookstore
she
stopped
me
in
front
of
the
window
and
pointing
at
some
huge
volumes
of
the
talmud
she
said
this
is
the
trade
i
am
going
to
have
you
learn
and
let
our
enemies
grow
green
with
envy

the
talmudic
seminary
or
yeshivah
in
which
my
mother
placed
me
was
a
celebrated
old
institution
attracting
students
from
many
provinces
like
most
yeshivahs
it
was
sustained
by
donations
and
instruction
in
it
was
free
moreover
students
found
shelter
under
its
roof
sleeping
on
the
benches
or
floors
of
the
same
rooms
in
which
the
lectures
were
delivered
and
studied
during
the
day
also
they
were
supplied
with
a
pound
of
rye
bread
each
for
breakfast
as
to
the
other
meals
they
were
furnished
by
the
various
households
of
the
orthodox
community
i
understand
that
some
in
certain
villages
of
new
england
get
their
board
on
the
rotation
plan
dining
each
day
in
the
week
with
another
family
this
is
exactly
the
way
a
poor
talmud
student
gets
his
sustenance
in
russia
the
system
being
called
eating
days
one
hour
a
day
was
devoted
to
penmanship
and
a
sorry
smattering
of
russian
the
cost
of
tuition
and
being
paid
by
a
modern
philanthropist
i
was
admitted
to
that
seminary
at
the
age
of
thirteen
as
my
home
was
in
the
city
i
neither
slept
in
the
classroom
nor
ate
days
the
lectures
lasted
only
two
hours
a
day
but
then
there
was
plenty
to
do
studying
them
and
reviewing
previous
work
this
i
did
in
an
old
house
of
prayer
where
many
other
boys
and
men
of
all
ages
pursued
similar
occupations
it
was
known
as
the
synagogue
and
was
famed
for
the
large
number
of
noted
scholars
who
had
passed
their
young
days
reading
talmud
in
it
the
talmud
is
a
voluminous
work
of
about
twenty
ponderous
tomes
to
read
these
books
to
drink
deep
of
their
sacred
wisdom
is
accounted
one
of
the
greatest
good
deeds
in
the
life
of
a
jew
it
is
however
as
much
a
source
of
intellectual
interest
as
an
act
of
piety
if
it
be
true
that
our
people
represent
a
high
percentage
of
mental
vigor
the
distinction
is
probably
due
in
some
measure
to
the
extremely
important
part
which
talmud
studies
have
played
in
the
spiritual
life
of
the
race
a
talmudic
education
was
until
recent
years
practically
the
only
kind
of
education
a
jewish
boy
of
parents
received
i
spent
seven
years
at
it
not
counting
the
several
years
of
talmud
which
i
had
had
at
the
various
cheders
what
is
the
talmud
the
bulk
of
it
is
taken
up
with
debates
of
ancient
rabbis
it
is
primarily
concerned
with
questions
of
conscience
religious
duty
and
human
sympathy
in
short
with
the
relations
between
man
and
god
and
those
between
man
and
man
but
it
practically
contains
a
consideration
of
almost
every
topic
under
the
sun
mostly
with
some
verse
of
the
pentateuch
for
a
pretext
all
of
which
is
analyzed
and
explained
in
the
minutest
and
keenest
fashion
discussions
on
abstruse
subjects
being
sometimes
relieved
by
an
anecdote
or
two
a
bit
of
folklore
worldly
wisdom
or
small
talk
scattered
through
its
numerous
volumes
are
priceless
gems
of
poetry
epigram
and
it
is
at
once
a
fountain
of
religious
inspiration
and
a
can
you
fathom
the
sea
neither
can
you
fathom
the
depths
of
the
talmud
as
we
would
put
it
we
were
sure
that
the
highest
mathematics
taught
in
the
gentile
universities
were
child
play
as
compared
to
the
talmud
in
the
preacher
synagogue
then
i
spent
seven
years
of
my
youthful
life
for
hours
and
hours
together
i
would
sit
at
a
gaunt
swaying
to
and
fro
over
some
huge
volume
reading
its
ancient
text
and
interpreting
it
in
yiddish
all
this
i
did
aloud
in
the
peculiar
talmud
singsong
a
trace
of
which
still
persists
in
my
intonation
even
when
i
talk
cloaks
and
bank
accounts
and
in
english
the
talmud
was
being
read
there
in
a
hundred
variations
of
the
same
singsong
literally
every
minute
of
the
year
except
the
hours
of
prayer
there
were
plenty
of
men
to
do
it
during
the
day
and
the
evening
and
at
least
ten
men
a
sacred
number
to
keep
the
holy
word
echoing
throughout
the
night
the
majority
of
them
were
simply
scholarly
business
men
who
would
drop
in
to
read
the
sacred
books
for
an
hour
or
two
but
there
was
a
considerable
number
of
such
as
made
it
the
occupation
of
their
life
these
were
supported
either
by
the
congregation
or
by
their
own
wives
who
kept
shops
stalls
inns
or
peddled
while
their
husbands
spent
sixteen
hours
a
day
studying
talmud
one
of
these
was
a
man
named
reb
rabbi
sender
an
insignificant
ungainly
little
figure
of
a
man
with
a
sad
little
face
flanked
by
a
pair
of
thick
heavy
that
seemed
to
weigh
him
down
his
wife
kept
a
or
something
of
the
sort
and
their
only
child
a
girl
older
than
i
helped
her
attend
to
business
as
well
as
to
keep
house
in
the
apartment
which
the
family
occupied
in
the
rear
of
the
little
shop
as
he
invariably
came
to
the
synagogue
for
the
morning
prayer
and
never
left
it
until
after
the
evening
service
his
breakfasts
and
dinners
were
brought
to
the
house
of
worship
his
wife
usually
came
with
the
meal
herself
waiting
on
one
husband
and
giving
him
strength
to
learn
the
law
was
a
good
deed
she
was
a
large
woman
with
an
interesting
dark
face
and
poor
reb
sender
cut
a
sorry
figure
by
her
side
men
of
his
class
are
described
as
having
no
acquaintance
with
the
face
of
a
coin
all
the
money
he
usually
handled
was
the
penny
or
two
which
he
needed
to
pay
for
his
bath
of
a
friday
afternoon
occasionally
he
would
earn
three
or
four
copecks
by
participating
in
some
special
prayer
for
a
sick
person
for
instance
these
pennies
he
invariably
gave
away
once
he
gave
his
muffler
to
a
poor
boy
his
wife
subsequently
nagged
him
to
death
for
it
the
next
morning
he
complained
of
her
to
one
of
the
other
scholars
still
he
concluded
if
you
want
to
serve
god
you
must
be
ready
to
suffer
for
it
a
good
deed
that
comes
easy
to
you
is
like
a
donation
which
does
not
cost
you
anything
i
made
his
acquaintance
by
asking
him
to
help
me
out
with
an
obscure
passage
this
he
did
with
such
simple
alacrity
and
kindly
modesty
as
to
make
me
feel
a
chum
of
his
i
warmed
to
him
and
he
reciprocated
my
feelings
he
took
me
to
his
bosom
he
often
offered
to
go
over
my
lesson
with
me
and
i
accepted
his
services
with
gratitude
he
spoke
in
a
warm
mellow
basso
that
had
won
my
heart
from
the
first
his
singsong
lent
peculiar
charm
to
the
pages
that
we
read
in
duet
as
he
read
and
interpreted
the
text
he
would
wave
his
by
way
of
punctuating
and
emphasizing
his
words
much
as
the
conductor
of
an
orchestra
does
his
baton
now
gently
insinuatingly
now
with
a
passionate
jerk
now
with
a
sweeping
majestic
movement
one
can
not
read
talmud
without
gesticulating
and
reb
sender
would
scarcely
have
been
able
to
gesticulate
without
his
it
was
of
tortoise
shell
with
a
bit
of
silver
in
the
center
it
gradually
became
dear
to
me
as
part
of
his
charming
personality
sometimes
when
we
were
reading
together
that
glistening
spot
in
the
center
of
the
lid
would
fascinate
my
eye
so
that
i
lost
track
of
the
subject
in
hand
he
often
hummed
some
liturgical
melody
of
a
synagogue
chanter
one
afternoon
he
sang
something
to
me
with
his
for
a
baton
and
then
asked
me
how
i
liked
it
i
composed
it
myself
he
explained
boastfully
i
did
not
like
the
tune
in
fact
i
failed
to
make
out
any
tune
at
all
but
i
was
overflowing
with
a
desire
to
please
him
so
i
said
with
feigned
enthusiasm
did
you
really
why
it
so
beautiful
so
sweet
reb
sender
face
shone
after
that
he
often
submitted
his
compositions
to
me
though
he
was
too
shy
to
sing
them
to
older
people
they
were
all
supposed
to
be
liturgical
tunes
or
at
least
some
hop
for
the
day
of
the
rejoicing
of
the
law
when
i
hailed
the
newly
composed
air
with
warm
approval
he
would
show
his
satisfaction
either
with
shamefaced
reserve
or
with
exuberance
if
on
the
other
hand
i
failed
to
conceal
my
indifference
he
would
grow
morose
and
it
would
be
some
time
before
i
succeeded
in
coaxing
him
back
to
his
usual
good
humor
nor
were
his
melodies
the
only
things
he
confided
to
me
when
i
was
still
a
mere
boy
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
old
he
would
lay
bare
to
me
some
of
the
most
intimate
secrets
of
his
heart
you
see
my
wife
thinks
me
a
fool
he
once
complained
to
me
she
thinks
i
do
see
it
do
you
understand
david
she
looks
up
to
me
for
my
learning
but
otherwise
she
thinks
i
have
no
sense
it
hurts
you
know
he
was
absolutely
incapable
of
keeping
a
secret
or
of
saying
or
acting
anything
that
did
not
come
from
the
depths
of
his
heart
he
often
talked
to
me
of
god
and
his
throne
of
the
world
to
come
and
of
the
eternal
bliss
of
the
righteous
quoting
from
a
certain
book
of
exhortations
and
adding
much
from
his
own
exalted
imagination
and
i
would
listen
thrilling
and
make
a
silent
vow
to
be
good
and
to
dedicate
my
life
to
the
service
of
god
study
the
word
of
god
davie
dear
he
would
say
taking
my
hand
into
his
there
is
no
happiness
like
it
what
is
wealth
a
dream
of
fools
what
is
this
world
a
mere
curl
of
smoke
for
the
wind
to
scatter
only
the
other
world
has
substance
and
reality
only
good
deeds
and
holy
learning
have
tangible
worth
beware
of
satan
davie
when
he
assails
you
just
say
no
turn
your
heart
to
steel
and
say
no
do
you
hear
my
son
the
anecdotes
and
sayings
of
the
talmud
its
absurdities
no
less
than
its
gems
of
epigrammatic
wisdom
were
mines
of
poetry
philosophy
and
science
to
him
he
was
a
dreamer
with
a
noble
imagination
with
a
soul
full
of
beauty
this
unsophisticated
man
with
the
mind
of
an
infant
was
one
of
the
most
scholars
in
town
his
great
delight
was
to
tackle
some
intricate
maze
of
talmudic
reasoning
this
he
would
do
with
ferocious
zest
like
a
warrior
attacking
the
enemy
flashing
his
tortoise
as
if
it
were
his
sword
when
away
from
his
books
or
when
reading
some
of
the
fantastic
tales
in
them
he
was
meek
and
gentle
as
a
little
bird
no
sooner
did
he
come
across
a
fine
bit
of
reasoning
than
he
would
impress
me
as
a
lion
on
one
occasion
after
reb
sender
got
through
a
celebrated
tangle
with
me
arousing
my
admiration
by
the
ingenuity
with
which
he
discovered
discrepancies
and
by
the
adroitness
with
which
he
explained
them
away
he
said
i
do
enjoy
reading
with
you
sometimes
when
i
read
by
myself
i
feel
lonely
anyhow
i
love
to
have
you
around
david
if
you
went
to
study
somewhere
else
i
should
miss
you
very
much
on
another
occasion
he
said
you
are
like
a
son
to
me
davie
be
good
be
genuinely
pious
for
my
sake
if
for
nothing
else
above
all
do
be
never
say
what
you
do
not
mean
do
not
utter
words
of
flattery
as
i
now
analyze
my
reminiscences
of
him
i
feel
that
he
was
a
yearning
lonely
man
he
was
in
love
with
his
wife
and
in
spite
of
her
devotion
to
him
he
was
poor
reb
sender
he
was
anything
but
a
handsome
man
while
she
was
well
built
and
pretty
and
so
it
may
be
that
she
showed
more
reverence
for
his
learning
and
piety
than
love
for
his
person
he
was
continually
referring
to
her
apparently
thirsting
to
discuss
her
demeanor
toward
him
the
lord
of
the
universe
has
been
exceptionally
good
to
me
he
once
said
to
me
may
i
not
forfeit
his
kindness
for
my
sins
he
gives
me
health
and
my
daily
bread
and
i
have
a
worthy
woman
for
a
wife
indeed
she
is
a
woman
of
rare
merits
so
clever
so
efficient
and
so
good
she
nags
me
but
seldom
very
seldom
he
paused
to
take
snuff
and
then
remained
silent
apparently
hesitating
to
come
to
the
point
finally
he
said
in
fact
she
is
so
wise
i
sometimes
wish
i
could
read
her
thoughts
i
should
give
anything
to
have
a
glimpse
into
her
heart
she
has
so
little
to
say
to
me
she
thinks
i
am
a
fool
there
is
a
sore
in
here
pointing
at
his
heart
we
have
been
married
over
years
and
yet
would
you
believe
it
i
still
feel
shy
in
her
presence
as
if
we
were
brought
together
for
the
first
time
by
a
do
you
know
but
then
you
are
too
young
to
understand
these
things
nor
indeed
ought
i
to
talk
to
you
about
them
for
you
are
only
a
child
but
i
can
not
help
it
if
i
did
not
unburden
my
mind
once
in
a
while
i
might
not
be
able
to
stand
it
that
afternoon
he
composed
what
he
called
a
very
sad
tune
and
hummed
it
to
me
i
failed
to
make
out
the
tune
but
i
could
feel
its
sadness
i
loved
him
passionately
as
for
the
other
men
of
the
synagogue
if
they
did
not
share
my
ardent
affection
for
him
they
all
with
one
exception
liked
him
the
exception
was
a
little
talmudist
with
a
tough
little
beard
who
held
everybody
in
terror
by
his
violent
temper
and
pugnacity
he
was
a
pious
man
but
his
piety
never
manifested
itself
with
such
genuine
fervor
as
when
he
exposed
the
impiety
of
others
he
was
forever
picking
quarrels
forever
challenging
people
to
debate
with
him
forever
offering
to
show
that
their
interpretation
of
this
passage
or
that
was
all
wrong
the
sound
of
his
acrimonious
voice
or
venomous
laughter
grated
on
reb
sender
nerves
but
he
bore
him
absolutely
no
nor
did
he
ever
utter
a
word
of
condemnation
concerning
a
certain
other
scholar
an
inveterate
and
though
a
fellow
who
not
infrequently
sought
to
embroil
him
with
some
of
his
warmest
friends
one
talmudist
a
corpulent
old
man
whose
seat
was
next
to
reb
sender
was
more
inclined
to
chat
than
to
study
now
and
again
he
would
break
in
upon
my
friend
reading
with
some
piece
of
gossip
and
the
piteous
air
with
which
reb
sender
would
listen
to
him
casting
yearning
glances
at
his
book
as
he
did
so
was
as
touching
as
it
was
amusing
my
mother
usually
brought
my
dinner
to
the
synagogue
she
would
make
her
entrance
softly
so
as
to
take
me
by
surprise
while
i
was
absorbed
in
my
studies
it
did
her
heart
good
to
see
me
read
the
holy
book
as
a
result
i
was
never
so
diligent
as
i
was
at
the
hour
when
i
expected
her
arrival
with
the
very
often
i
discovered
her
tiptoeing
in
or
standing
at
a
distance
and
watching
me
admiringly
then
i
would
take
to
singing
and
swaying
to
and
fro
with
great
gusto
she
often
encountered
reb
sender
wife
at
the
synagogue
they
did
not
take
to
each
other
on
one
occasion
my
mother
found
reb
sender
daughter
at
the
house
of
prayer
having
her
father
figure
and
features
the
girl
was
anything
but
prepossessing
my
mother
surveyed
her
from
head
to
foot
that
evening
when
i
was
eating
my
supper
at
home
my
mother
said
look
here
davie
i
want
you
to
understand
that
reb
sender
wife
is
up
to
some
scheme
about
you
she
wants
you
to
marry
that
monkey
of
hers
that
what
she
is
after
i
was
not
quite
fifteen
leave
me
alone
i
retorted
coloring
never
mind
blushing
it
is
she
who
tells
reb
sender
to
be
so
good
to
you
the
foxy
thing
she
thinks
i
do
see
through
her
that
scarecrow
of
a
girl
is
old
enough
to
be
your
mother
and
she
has
not
a
penny
to
her
marriage
portion
either
a
fine
match
for
a
boy
like
you
why
you
can
get
the
best
girl
in
town
she
said
it
aloud
by
way
of
flaunting
my
future
before
our
two
of
the
three
families
who
shared
the
room
with
us
by
the
way
were
the
same
as
when
i
was
a
little
boy
moving
was
a
rare
event
in
the
life
of
the
average
antomir
family
red
esther
was
still
there
she
was
one
of
those
who
heard
my
mother
boastful
warning
to
me
she
grinned
after
a
little
as
i
was
crossing
the
room
she
sang
out
with
a
giggle
bridegroom
i
break
your
bones
i
returned
pausing
she
stuck
out
her
tongue
at
me
i
still
hated
her
but
somehow
she
did
not
seem
to
be
the
same
as
she
had
been
before
the
new
lines
that
were
developing
in
her
growing
little
figure
and
more
particularly
her
own
consciousness
of
them
were
not
lost
upon
me
a
new
element
was
stealing
into
my
rancor
for
her
a
feeling
of
forbidden
curiosity
at
night
when
i
lay
in
bed
before
falling
asleep
i
would
be
alive
to
the
fact
that
she
was
sleeping
in
the
same
room
only
a
few
feet
from
me
sometimes
i
would
conjure
up
the
days
of
our
childhood
when
red
esther
caused
me
to
sin
against
my
will
whereupon
i
would
try
to
imagine
the
same
scenes
but
with
the
present
esther
in
place
of
the
one
of
yore
the
word
girl
had
acquired
a
novel
sound
for
me
one
full
of
disquieting
charm
the
same
was
true
of
such
words
as
sister
niece
or
bride
but
not
of
woman
somehow
sisters
and
nieces
were
all
young
girls
whereas
a
woman
belonged
to
the
realm
of
humanity
not
to
my
world
naphtali
went
to
the
same
seminary
he
was
two
grades
ahead
of
me
he
ate
days
for
his
father
had
died
and
his
mother
had
married
a
man
who
refused
to
support
him
he
was
my
great
chum
at
the
seminary
the
students
called
him
tidy
naphtali
or
simply
the
tidy
one
he
was
a
slender
trim
lad
his
curly
brown
hair
and
his
eyes
emphasizing
his
talmudic
appearance
he
was
the
cleanliest
and
neatest
boy
at
the
yeshivah
this
often
aroused
sardonic
witticism
from
some
of
the
other
students
scrupulous
tidiness
was
so
uncommon
a
virtue
among
the
poorer
classes
of
antomir
that
the
painstaking
care
he
bestowed
upon
his
person
and
everything
with
which
he
came
in
contact
struck
many
of
the
boys
as
a
manifestation
of
squeamishness
as
for
me
it
only
added
to
my
admiration
of
him
his
conscience
seemed
to
be
as
clean
as
his
he
wrote
a
beautiful
hand
he
could
draw
and
carve
and
he
was
a
good
singer
his
interpretations
were
as
as
his
handwriting
he
seemed
to
be
a
jack
of
all
trades
and
master
of
all
i
admired
and
envied
him
his
reticence
piqued
me
and
intensified
his
power
over
me
i
strove
to
emulate
his
cleanliness
his
graceful
talmud
gestures
and
his
handwriting
at
one
period
i
spent
many
hours
a
day
practising
caligraphy
with
some
of
his
lines
for
a
model
oh
i
shall
never
be
able
to
write
like
you
i
once
said
to
him
in
despair
let
us
swap
then
he
replied
give
me
your
mind
for
learning
and
i
shall
let
you
have
my
handwriting
pshaw
yours
is
a
better
mind
than
mine
too
no
it
is
not
he
returned
and
resumed
his
reading
besides
you
are
ahead
of
me
in
piety
and
conduct
he
shook
his
head
deprecatingly
and
went
on
reading
he
was
one
of
the
noted
men
of
diligence
at
the
seminary
with
his
eyes
close
to
the
book
he
would
read
all
day
and
far
into
the
night
in
ringing
ardent
singsongs
that
i
thought
fascinating
the
other
reticent
talmudists
i
knew
usually
read
in
an
undertone
humming
their
recitatives
quietly
he
seldom
did
sparing
as
he
was
of
his
voice
in
conversation
he
would
use
it
extravagantly
when
intoning
his
talmud
it
is
with
a
peculiar
sense
of
duality
one
reads
this
ancient
work
while
your
mind
is
absorbed
in
the
meaning
of
the
words
you
utter
the
melody
in
which
you
utter
them
tells
your
heart
a
tale
of
its
own
you
live
in
two
distinct
worlds
at
once
naphtali
had
little
to
say
to
other
people
but
he
seemed
to
have
much
to
say
to
himself
his
singsongs
were
full
of
meaning
of
passion
of
beauty
quite
often
he
would
sing
himself
hoarse
regularly
every
thursday
night
he
and
i
had
our
vigil
at
the
preacher
synagogue
where
many
other
young
men
would
gather
for
the
same
purpose
we
would
sit
up
reading
side
by
side
until
the
worshipers
came
to
morning
service
to
spend
a
whole
night
by
his
side
was
one
of
the
joys
of
my
existence
in
those
days
reb
sender
was
somewhat
jealous
of
him
soon
after
graduation
naphtali
left
antomir
for
a
town
in
which
lived
some
of
his
relatives
i
missed
him
as
i
would
a
sweetheart
chapter
ii
i
was
nearly
sixteen
i
had
graduated
from
the
seminary
and
was
pursuing
my
studies
at
the
synagogue
exclusively
as
an
independent
scholar
i
was
overborne
with
a
sense
of
my
dignity
and
freedom
i
seemed
to
have
suddenly
grown
much
taller
if
i
caught
myself
walking
fast
or
indulging
in
some
boyish
prank
i
would
check
myself
saying
in
my
heart
you
must
not
forget
that
you
are
an
independent
scholar
you
are
a
boy
no
longer
i
was
free
to
loaf
but
i
worked
harder
than
ever
i
was
either
in
an
exalted
state
of
mind
or
pining
away
under
a
spell
of
yearning
and
melancholy
of
causeless
meaningless
melancholy
my
talmudic
singsong
reflected
my
moods
sometimes
it
was
a
spirited
recitative
ringing
with
cheery
and
the
joy
of
being
a
lad
of
sixteen
at
other
times
it
was
a
solemn
song
aglow
with
devotional
ecstasy
when
i
happened
to
be
dejected
in
the
commonplace
sense
of
the
word
it
was
a
listless
murmur
doleful
or
sullen
but
then
the
very
reading
of
the
talmud
was
apt
to
dispel
my
gloom
my
voice
would
gradually
rise
and
ring
out
vibrating
with
intellectual
passion
the
intonations
of
the
other
scholars
too
echoed
the
voices
of
their
hearts
some
of
them
sonorous
with
religious
bliss
others
sad
still
others
although
absorbed
in
my
book
i
would
have
a
vague
consciousness
of
the
connection
between
the
various
singsongs
and
their
respective
performers
i
would
be
aware
that
the
bass
voice
with
the
flourishes
in
front
of
me
belonged
to
the
stuttering
widower
from
vitebsk
that
the
squeaky
jerky
intonation
to
the
right
came
from
the
fellow
whom
i
loathed
for
his
thick
lips
or
that
the
sweet
unassertive
cadences
that
came
floating
from
the
east
wall
were
being
uttered
by
reb
rachmiel
the
man
of
acumen
whose
had
made
a
fortune
as
a
in
the
late
conflict
with
turkey
all
these
voices
blended
in
a
symphonic
source
of
inspiration
for
me
it
was
divine
music
in
more
senses
than
one
the
ancient
rabbis
of
the
talmud
the
tanaim
of
the
earlier
period
and
the
amorairn
of
later
generations
were
living
men
i
could
almost
see
them
each
of
them
individualized
in
my
mind
by
some
of
his
sayings
by
his
manner
in
debate
by
some
particular
word
he
used
or
by
some
particular
incident
in
which
he
figured
i
pictured
their
faces
their
beards
their
voices
some
of
them
had
won
a
warmer
corner
in
my
heart
than
others
but
they
were
all
superior
human
beings
godly
unearthly
denizens
of
a
world
that
had
been
ages
ago
and
would
come
back
in
the
remote
future
when
messiah
should
make
his
appearance
added
to
the
mystery
of
that
world
was
the
mystery
of
my
own
singsong
who
is
there
i
seemed
to
be
wondering
my
tune
or
recitative
sounding
like
the
voice
of
some
other
fellow
it
was
as
if
somebody
were
hidden
within
me
what
did
he
look
like
if
you
study
the
talmud
you
please
god
even
more
than
you
do
by
praying
or
fasting
as
you
sit
reading
the
great
folio
he
looks
down
from
heaven
upon
you
sometimes
i
seemed
to
feel
his
gaze
shining
down
upon
me
as
though
casting
a
halo
over
my
bead
my
relations
with
god
were
of
a
personal
and
of
a
rather
familiar
character
he
was
interested
in
everything
i
did
or
said
he
watched
my
every
move
or
thought
he
was
always
in
heaven
yet
somehow
he
was
always
near
me
and
i
often
spoke
to
him
as
i
might
to
reb
sender
if
i
caught
myself
slurring
over
some
of
my
prayers
or
speaking
ill
of
another
boy
or
telling
a
falsehood
i
would
say
to
him
audibly
oh
forgive
me
once
more
you
know
that
i
want
to
be
good
i
will
be
good
i
know
i
will
sometimes
i
would
continue
to
plead
in
this
manner
till
i
broke
into
sobs
at
other
times
as
i
read
my
talmud
conscious
of
his
approval
of
me
tears
of
bliss
would
come
into
my
eyes
i
loved
him
as
one
does
a
woman
often
while
saying
my
prayers
i
would
fall
into
a
veritable
delirium
of
religious
infatuation
sometimes
this
fit
of
happiness
and
yearning
would
seize
me
as
i
walked
in
the
street
o
master
of
the
world
master
of
the
universe
i
love
you
so
i
would
sigh
oh
how
i
love
you
i
also
had
talks
with
the
evil
spirit
or
satan
he
too
was
always
near
me
but
he
was
always
trying
to
get
me
into
trouble
you
wo
catch
me
again
scoundrel
you
i
would
assure
him
with
sneers
and
leers
or
get
away
from
me
heartless
you
you
wasting
your
time
i
can
tell
you
that
my
bursts
of
piety
usually
lasted
a
week
or
two
then
there
was
apt
to
set
in
a
period
of
apathy
which
was
sure
to
be
replaced
by
days
of
penance
and
a
new
access
of
spiritual
fervor
one
day
as
reb
sender
and
i
were
reading
a
page
together
a
very
pretty
girl
entered
the
synagogue
she
came
to
have
a
letter
written
for
her
by
one
of
the
scholars
i
continued
to
read
aloud
but
i
did
so
absently
now
trailing
along
after
my
companion
my
mind
was
upon
the
girl
and
i
was
casting
furtive
glances
reb
sender
paused
with
evident
annoyance
what
are
you
looking
at
david
he
said
with
a
tug
at
my
arm
shame
you
are
yielding
to
satan
i
colored
he
was
too
deeply
interested
in
the
talmudic
argument
under
consideration
to
say
more
on
the
matter
at
this
minute
but
he
returned
to
it
as
soon
as
we
had
reached
the
end
of
the
section
he
spoke
earnestly
with
fatherly
concern
you
are
growing
david
you
are
a
boy
no
longer
you
are
getting
to
be
a
man
this
is
just
the
time
when
one
should
be
on
his
guard
against
satan
i
sat
looking
down
my
brain
in
a
daze
of
embarrassment
remember
david
who
looks
even
at
the
little
finger
of
a
woman
is
as
guilty
as
though
he
looked
at
a
woman
that
is
wholly
naked
he
quoted
the
talmudic
maxim
in
a
tone
of
passionate
sternness
beating
the
desk
with
his
at
each
word
as
to
his
own
conduct
he
was
one
of
three
or
four
men
at
the
synagogue
of
whom
it
was
said
that
they
never
looked
at
women
and
to
a
very
considerable
extent
his
reputation
was
not
unjustified
you
must
never
tire
fighting
satan
david
he
proceeded
fight
him
with
might
and
main
as
i
listened
i
was
tingling
with
a
mute
vow
to
be
good
yet
at
the
same
time
the
vision
of
a
woman
that
is
wholly
naked
was
vividly
before
me
he
caused
me
to
bring
a
certain
ancient
work
one
not
included
in
the
talmud
in
which
he
made
me
read
the
following
rabbi
mathia
the
son
of
chovosh
had
never
set
eyes
on
a
woman
therefore
when
he
was
at
the
synagogue
studying
the
law
his
visage
would
shine
as
the
sun
and
its
features
would
be
the
features
of
an
angel
one
day
as
he
thus
sat
reading
satan
chanced
to
pass
by
and
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
satan
said
it
really
be
that
this
man
has
never
sinned
is
a
man
of
spotless
purity
answered
god
grant
me
the
liberty
satan
urged
i
will
lead
him
to
sin
will
never
succeed
me
try
satan
then
appeared
in
the
guise
of
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
of
one
the
like
of
whom
had
not
been
born
since
the
days
of
naomi
the
sister
of
tuval
cain
the
woman
who
had
led
angels
astray
when
rabbi
mathia
espied
her
he
faced
about
so
satan
still
in
the
disguise
of
a
beautiful
woman
took
up
a
position
on
the
left
side
of
him
and
when
he
turned
away
once
more
he
walked
over
to
the
right
side
again
finally
rabbi
mathia
had
nails
and
fire
brought
him
and
gouged
out
his
own
eyes
at
this
god
called
for
angel
raphael
and
bade
him
cure
the
righteous
man
presently
raphael
came
back
with
the
report
that
rabbi
mathia
would
not
be
cured
lest
he
should
again
be
tempted
to
look
at
pretty
women
tell
him
in
my
name
that
he
shall
never
be
tempted
again
said
god
and
so
the
holy
man
regained
his
eyesight
and
was
never
molested
by
satan
again
the
painful
image
of
poor
rabbi
m
athia
gouging
out
his
eyes
supplanted
the
nude
figure
of
the
previous
quotation
in
my
mind
reb
sender
pursued
his
exhortative
talk
he
dwelt
on
the
duties
of
man
to
man
if
a
man
is
do
laugh
at
him
but
rather
feel
pity
for
him
as
you
would
for
a
man
with
broken
legs
nor
should
you
hate
a
man
who
has
a
weakness
for
telling
falsehoods
this
too
is
an
affliction
like
stuttering
or
being
lame
say
to
yourself
fellow
he
is
given
to
lying
above
all
you
must
fight
conceit
envy
and
every
kind
of
in
your
heart
remember
the
sum
and
substance
of
all
learning
lies
in
the
words
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
another
thing
remember
that
it
is
not
enough
to
abstain
from
lying
by
word
of
mouth
for
the
worst
lies
are
often
conveyed
by
a
false
look
smile
or
act
be
genuinely
truthful
then
and
if
you
feel
that
you
are
good
do
be
too
proud
of
it
be
modest
humble
simple
control
your
anger
he
worked
me
up
to
a
veritable
frenzy
of
penitence
i
will
i
will
i
said
tremulously
and
if
i
ever
catch
myself
looking
at
a
woman
again
i
will
gouge
out
my
eyes
like
rabbi
mathia
do
say
that
my
son
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
as
i
sat
reading
by
myself
i
suddenly
sprang
to
my
feet
and
walked
over
to
reb
sender
you
are
so
dear
to
me
i
gasped
out
you
are
a
man
of
perfect
righteousness
i
love
you
so
i
should
jump
into
fire
or
into
water
for
your
sake
he
said
taking
me
gently
by
the
hand
and
pressing
me
down
into
a
seat
by
his
side
you
are
a
good
boy
as
to
my
being
a
man
of
perfect
righteousness
alas
i
am
far
from
being
one
we
are
all
sinful
come
let
us
read
another
page
together
satan
kept
me
rather
busy
these
days
it
was
not
an
easy
task
to
keep
one
eyes
off
the
girls
who
came
to
the
synagogue
and
when
none
was
around
i
would
be
apt
to
think
of
one
i
would
even
picture
myself
touching
a
feminine
cheek
with
the
tip
of
my
finger
then
my
heart
would
sink
in
despair
and
i
would
hurl
curses
at
satan
eighty
black
years
on
you
vile
wretch
you
i
would
whisper
gnashing
my
teeth
and
fall
to
reading
with
ferocious
zeal
in
the
relations
between
men
and
women
it
is
largely
case
of
forbidden
fruit
and
the
mystery
of
distance
the
great
barrier
that
religion
law
and
convention
have
laced
between
the
sexes
adds
to
the
joys
and
poetry
of
love
but
it
is
responsible
also
for
much
of
the
suffering
degradation
and
crime
that
spring
from
it
in
my
case
his
barrier
was
of
special
magnitude
dancing
with
a
girl
or
even
taking
one
out
for
a
walk
was
out
of
the
question
nor
was
the
injunction
confined
to
men
who
devoted
themselves
to
the
study
of
holy
books
it
was
the
rule
of
ordinary
decency
for
any
jew
except
one
who
lived
like
a
gentile
that
is
like
a
person
of
modern
culture
indeed
there
were
scores
of
towns
in
the
vicinity
of
antomir
where
one
could
not
take
a
walk
even
with
one
own
wife
without
incurring
universal
condemnation
there
was
a
or
two
in
antomir
but
they
were
attended
by
young
mechanics
of
the
coarser
type
to
be
sure
there
were
plenty
of
young
jews
in
our
town
who
did
live
like
gentiles
who
called
the
girls
of
their
acquaintance
young
ladies
took
off
their
hats
to
them
took
them
out
for
a
walk
in
the
public
park
and
danced
with
them
just
like
the
nobles
or
the
army
officers
of
my
birthplace
but
then
these
fellows
spoke
russian
instead
of
yiddish
and
altogether
they
belonged
to
a
world
far
removed
from
mine
many
of
these
modern
young
jews
went
to
high
school
and
wore
pretty
uniforms
with
buttons
and
silver
lace
to
me
they
were
apostates
sinners
in
israel
and
yet
i
could
not
think
of
them
without
a
lurking
feeling
of
envy
the
gentile
books
they
studied
and
their
social
relations
with
girls
who
were
dressed
like
young
noblewomen
piqued
my
keenest
curiosity
and
made
me
feel
small
and
wretched
the
orthodox
jewish
faith
practically
excludes
woman
from
religious
life
attending
divine
service
is
not
obligatory
for
her
and
those
of
the
sex
who
wish
to
do
so
are
allowed
to
follow
the
devotions
not
in
the
synagogue
proper
but
through
little
windows
or
peepholes
in
the
wall
of
an
adjoining
room
in
the
eye
of
the
spiritual
law
that
governed
my
life
women
were
intended
for
two
purposes
only
for
the
continuation
of
the
human
species
and
to
serve
as
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
satan
for
tempting
the
stronger
sex
to
sin
marriage
was
simply
a
duty
imposed
by
the
bible
love
so
far
as
it
meant
attraction
between
two
persons
of
the
opposite
sex
who
were
not
man
and
wife
there
was
no
such
word
in
my
native
tongue
one
loved
one
wife
mother
daughter
or
sister
to
be
in
love
with
a
girl
who
was
an
utter
stranger
to
you
was
something
unseemly
something
which
only
gentiles
or
modern
jews
might
indulge
in
but
at
present
all
this
merely
deepened
the
bewitching
mystery
of
the
forbidden
sex
in
my
young
blood
and
satan
wide
awake
and
as
ever
was
not
slow
to
perceive
the
change
that
had
come
over
me
and
made
the
most
of
it
there
was
no
such
thing
as
athletics
or
outdoor
sports
in
my
world
the
only
physical
exercise
known
to
us
was
to
be
swinging
like
a
pendulum
in
front
of
your
from
nine
in
the
morning
to
bedtime
every
day
and
an
vigil
every
thursday
in
addition
even
a
most
innocent
frolic
among
the
boys
was
suppressed
as
an
offense
to
good
judaism
all
of
which
tended
to
deepen
the
mystery
of
girlhood
and
to
increase
the
chances
of
satan
i
must
explain
that
although
women
could
not
attend
divine
service
except
through
a
peephole
they
were
free
to
visit
the
house
of
worship
on
all
sorts
of
other
errands
so
some
of
them
would
come
with
food
for
the
scholars
others
with
candles
for
the
chandeliers
while
still
others
wanted
letters
read
or
written
one
of
the
several
rabbis
of
the
town
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
his
evenings
reading
talmud
in
the
preacher
synagogue
so
housewives
of
the
neighborhood
or
their
daughters
would
bring
some
spoon
pot
or
chicken
to
have
them
passed
upon
according
to
the
dietary
laws
of
moses
and
the
talmud
i
would
scrutinize
the
faces
and
figures
of
these
girls
i
would
draw
comparisons
make
guesses
as
to
whether
they
were
engaged
to
be
married
i
did
not
have
to
speculate
upon
whether
they
were
already
married
because
a
young
matron
who
would
visit
our
synagogue
was
sure
to
have
her
hair
covered
with
a
wig
it
became
one
of
my
pastimes
to
make
forecasts
as
to
the
looks
of
the
next
young
woman
to
call
at
the
synagogue
whether
she
would
be
pretty
or
homely
tall
or
short
fair
or
dark
plump
or
spare
i
was
interested
in
their
eyes
but
somehow
i
was
still
more
interested
in
their
mouths
some
mouths
would
set
my
blood
on
fire
i
would
invent
all
sorts
of
romantic
episodes
with
myself
as
the
hero
i
would
portray
my
engagement
to
some
of
the
pretty
girls
i
had
seen
our
wedding
and
above
all
our
married
life
the
worst
of
it
was
that
these
images
often
visited
my
brain
while
i
was
reading
the
holy
book
satan
would
choose
such
moments
of
all
others
because
in
this
manner
he
would
involve
me
in
two
great
sins
at
once
for
in
addition
to
the
wickedness
of
indulging
in
salacious
thoughts
there
was
the
offense
of
desecrating
the
holy
book
by
them
reb
sender
daughter
was
about
to
be
married
to
a
tradesman
of
talmudic
education
i
did
not
care
for
her
in
the
least
yet
her
approaching
wedding
aroused
a
lively
interest
in
me
red
esther
had
gone
out
to
service
she
came
home
but
seldom
and
when
she
did
we
scarcely
ever
talked
to
each
other
the
coarse
brightness
of
her
complexion
and
the
harsh
femininity
of
her
laughter
repelled
me
i
do
hate
her
i
once
said
to
myself
as
i
heard
that
laugh
of
hers
and
yet
you
would
not
mind
kissing
her
would
you
now
a
voice
retorted
i
had
to
own
that
i
would
not
and
then
i
cudgeled
my
brains
over
the
amazing
discrepancy
of
the
thing
kissing
meant
being
fond
of
one
i
enjoyed
kissing
my
mother
for
instance
now
i
certainly
was
not
fond
of
esther
i
was
sure
that
i
hated
her
why
then
was
i
impelled
to
kiss
her
how
could
i
hate
and
be
fond
of
her
at
once
i
went
on
reasoning
it
out
talmud
fashion
till
i
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
there
were
two
kinds
of
kisses
the
kiss
of
affection
and
the
kiss
of
satan
i
submitted
it
as
a
discovery
to
some
of
the
other
young
talmudists
but
they
scouted
it
as
a
truism
a
majority
of
us
were
modest
of
speech
and
conduct
but
there
were
some
who
were
not
chapter
iii
when
i
was
a
little
over
eighteen
the
number
of
steady
readers
at
the
old
synagogue
was
increased
by
the
advent
of
a
youth
from
the
polish
provinces
his
appearance
produced
something
of
a
sensation
for
in
addition
to
being
the
son
of
a
rich
merchant
and
the
prospective
of
a
celebrated
rabbi
he
was
the
possessor
of
a
truly
phenomenal
memory
he
was
well
versed
in
the
entire
talmud
and
could
recite
by
heart
about
five
hundred
leaves
or
one
thousand
pages
of
it
he
was
generally
called
the
pole
he
was
tall
and
supple
and
with
a
suggestion
of
and
aloofness
in
the
very
sinuosity
of
his
figure
his
velvet
which
was
always
pushed
back
on
his
head
exposed
to
view
a
forelock
of
golden
hair
his
coat
was
of
the
richest
broadcloth
i
had
ever
seen
he
wore
a
watch
and
chain
that
were
said
to
be
worth
a
small
fortune
i
hated
him
he
was
repugnant
to
me
for
his
polish
accent
for
his
good
clothes
for
his
face
for
his
haughty
manner
for
the
servile
attention
that
was
showered
on
him
and
above
all
for
his
extraordinary
memory
i
had
always
been
under
the
impression
that
the
boys
of
parents
were
stupid
brains
did
not
seem
to
be
in
their
line
that
this
young
man
who
was
so
well
supplied
with
this
world
goods
should
possess
a
wonderful
mind
as
well
jarred
on
me
as
an
injustice
to
us
poor
boys
i
would
seek
comfort
in
the
reflection
that
the
essence
of
scholarship
lay
in
profundity
and
acumen
rather
than
in
the
ability
to
rattle
off
pages
like
so
many
psalms
yet
those
five
hundred
leaves
of
his
gave
me
no
peace
five
hundred
the
figure
haunted
me
finally
i
set
myself
the
task
of
memorizing
five
hundred
leaves
it
was
a
gigantic
undertaking
although
my
memory
was
rather
above
the
average
i
worked
with
unflagging
assiduity
for
weeks
and
weeks
nobody
was
to
know
of
my
purpose
until
it
had
been
achieved
i
worked
so
hard
and
was
so
absorbed
in
my
task
that
my
interest
in
girls
lost
much
of
its
usual
acuteness
at
times
i
had
a
sense
of
my
own
holiness
when
i
walked
through
the
streets
on
my
way
to
or
from
the
synagogue
i
kept
reciting
some
of
the
pages
i
had
mastered
while
in
bed
for
the
night
i
whispered
myself
to
sleep
reciting
talmud
when
i
ate
some
bit
of
talmud
was
apt
to
be
running
through
my
mind
if
there
was
a
hitch
and
i
could
not
go
on
my
heart
would
sink
within
me
i
would
stop
eating
and
make
an
effort
to
recall
the
passage
it
was
inevitable
that
the
new
character
of
my
studies
should
sooner
or
later
attract
reb
sender
attention
my
secret
hung
like
a
veil
between
us
he
was
jealous
of
it
ultimately
he
questioned
me
beseechingly
and
i
was
forced
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
reb
sender
beamed
the
veil
was
withdrawn
presently
his
face
fell
again
what
i
do
like
about
it
is
your
envy
of
the
pole
he
said
gravely
do
take
it
ill
my
son
but
i
am
afraid
you
are
envious
and
begrudging
fight
it
davie
give
up
studying
by
heart
it
is
not
with
a
pure
motive
you
are
doing
it
your
studies
are
poisoned
with
hatred
and
malice
do
you
want
to
gladden
my
heart
davie
i
do
i
will
what
do
you
mean
just
step
up
to
the
pole
and
beg
his
pardon
for
the
evil
thoughts
you
have
harbored
about
him
a
minute
later
i
stood
in
front
of
my
hated
rival
thrilling
with
the
ecstasy
of
penitence
i
have
sinned
against
you
forgive
me
i
said
with
downcast
eyes
the
pole
was
puzzled
i
envied
you
i
explained
i
could
not
bear
to
hear
everybody
speak
of
the
five
hundred
leaves
you
know
by
heart
so
i
wanted
to
show
you
that
i
could
learn
by
heart
just
as
much
if
not
more
a
suggestion
of
a
sneer
flitted
across
his
face
it
stung
me
as
if
it
were
some
loathsome
insect
his
golden
forelock
exasperated
me
and
i
could
do
it
too
i
snapped
i
have
learned
more
than
fifty
leaves
already
it
is
not
so
much
of
a
trick
as
i
thought
it
was
is
it
not
the
pole
said
with
a
sneer
you
need
not
be
so
stuck
up
anyhow
i
shot
back
and
turned
away
before
i
had
reached
reb
sender
who
had
been
watching
us
i
rushed
back
to
the
pole
i
just
want
to
say
this
i
began
in
a
towering
rage
with
all
your
boasted
memory
you
would
be
glad
to
change
brains
with
me
his
shoulders
shook
with
soundless
mirth
laugh
away
but
let
reb
sender
examine
both
of
us
let
him
select
a
passage
and
see
who
of
us
can
delve
deeper
into
it
you
or
i
memory
alone
is
nothing
is
it
then
why
are
you
green
with
envy
of
me
and
once
more
he
burst
into
a
laugh
with
a
graceful
jerk
of
his
head
which
set
my
blood
on
fire
you
a
pampered
idiot
you
green
with
envy
i
break
every
bone
in
you
we
flew
at
each
other
but
reb
sender
and
two
other
scholars
tore
us
apart
shame
the
talmudists
cried
shrugging
their
shoulders
in
disgust
just
like
gentiles
some
one
commented
it
is
an
outrage
to
have
the
holy
place
desecrated
in
this
manner
what
has
got
into
you
reb
sender
said
to
me
as
he
led
me
back
to
my
desk
i
resumed
studying
by
heart
with
more
energy
than
ever
all
right
i
thought
to
myself
i
have
that
of
a
fellow
lick
the
dust
of
my
shoes
i
now
took
special
measures
to
guard
my
secret
even
from
reb
sender
one
of
these
was
to
take
a
book
home
and
to
work
there
staying
away
from
synagogue
as
often
as
i
could
invent
a
plausible
pretext
i
was
lying
right
and
left
satan
chuckled
in
my
face
but
i
did
not
care
i
promised
myself
to
settle
my
accounts
with
the
uppermost
later
on
the
only
thing
that
mattered
now
was
to
beat
the
pole
the
sight
of
me
learning
the
word
of
god
so
diligently
was
a
source
of
indescribable
joy
to
my
mother
she
struggled
to
suppress
her
feeling
but
from
time
to
time
a
sigh
would
escape
her
as
though
the
rush
of
happiness
was
too
much
for
her
heart
alas
this
happiness
of
hers
was
not
to
last
much
longer
book
iii
i
lose
my
mother
chapter
i
it
was
purim
the
feast
of
esther
our
were
celebrating
the
downfall
of
haman
and
they
were
doing
it
in
the
same
fashion
in
which
american
boys
celebrate
their
forefathers
defiance
of
george
iii
the
synagogues
roared
with
the
booming
of
the
report
of
toy
pistols
the
of
purim
rattles
it
was
four
weeks
to
the
great
festival
of
passover
and
my
mother
went
to
work
in
a
bakery
of
unleavened
bread
she
toiled
from
eighteen
to
twenty
hours
a
day
so
that
she
often
dozed
off
over
her
from
sheer
exhaustion
but
then
she
earned
far
more
than
usual
including
tips
from
customers
the
baker
merely
acted
as
a
contractor
for
the
families
whose
flour
he
transformed
into
flat
round
tasteless
passover
cakes
or
matzoths
she
saved
up
during
the
period
a
little
over
twenty
rubles
with
a
part
of
this
sum
she
ordered
a
new
coat
for
me
and
bought
me
a
new
cap
i
remember
that
coat
very
well
it
was
of
a
cotton
stuff
neat
at
the
waist
and
with
absurdly
long
skirts
of
course
the
jewish
passover
often
concurs
with
the
christian
easter
this
was
the
case
in
the
year
in
question
one
afternoon
it
was
the
seventh
day
of
our
festival
i
chanced
to
be
crossing
the
as
it
was
not
market
day
it
was
deserted
save
for
groups
of
young
gentiles
civilians
and
soldiers
who
were
rolling
brightly
colored
easter
eggs
over
the
ground
my
new
coat
and
provoked
their
mirth
until
one
of
them
hit
me
a
savage
blow
in
the
face
splitting
my
lower
lip
another
rowdy
snatched
off
my
new
cap
just
because
our
people
considered
it
a
sin
to
go
bareheaded
and
as
i
made
my
way
bleeding
with
one
hand
to
my
lip
and
the
other
over
my
bare
head
the
company
sent
a
shower
of
broken
eggs
and
a
chorus
of
jeers
after
me
it
was
only
a
short
distance
from
abner
court
when
i
entered
our
basement
and
faced
my
mother
she
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
as
though
dumfounded
and
then
slapping
her
hands
together
she
sobbed
woe
is
me
darkness
is
me
what
has
happened
to
you
when
she
had
heard
my
story
she
stood
silent
awhile
looking
aghast
and
then
left
the
house
i
going
to
kill
him
i
am
just
going
to
kill
him
she
said
in
measured
accents
which
still
ring
in
my
ears
the
bookbinder
wife
the
retired
soldier
and
i
ran
after
her
imploring
her
not
to
risk
her
life
on
such
a
foolhardy
errand
but
she
took
no
heed
of
us
foolish
woman
you
do
even
know
who
did
it
urged
the
soldier
i
find
out
she
answered
the
bookbinder
wife
seized
her
by
an
arm
but
she
shook
her
off
i
pleaded
with
her
with
tears
in
my
eyes
go
back
she
said
to
me
trying
to
be
gentle
while
her
eyes
were
lit
with
an
ominous
look
these
were
the
last
words
i
ever
heard
her
utter
fifteen
minutes
later
she
was
carried
into
our
basement
unconscious
her
face
was
bruised
and
swollen
and
the
back
of
her
head
was
broken
she
died
the
same
evening
i
have
never
been
able
to
learn
the
ghastly
details
of
her
death
the
police
and
an
examining
magistrate
were
said
to
be
investigating
the
case
but
nothing
came
of
it
there
was
no
lack
of
excitement
among
the
jews
of
antomir
the
funeral
was
expected
to
draw
a
vast
crowd
but
the
epidemic
of
atrocities
of
and
were
fresh
in
one
mind
so
word
was
passed
round
not
to
irritate
the
gentiles
the
younger
and
modern
element
in
town
took
exception
to
this
timidity
they
insisted
upon
a
demonstrative
funeral
they
were
organizing
for
in
case
the
procession
was
interfered
with
but
the
counsel
of
older
people
prevailed
as
a
consequence
the
number
of
mourners
following
the
hearse
was
even
smaller
than
it
would
have
been
if
my
mother
had
died
a
natural
death
and
the
few
who
did
take
part
in
the
sad
procession
were
unusually
silent
a
jewish
funeral
without
a
chorus
of
sobbing
women
was
inconceivable
in
antomir
indeed
a
pious
matron
who
happens
to
come
across
such
a
scene
will
join
in
the
weeping
whether
she
had
ever
heard
of
the
deceased
or
not
on
this
occasion
however
sobs
were
conspicuous
by
their
absence
none
of
your
wailing
an
old
man
kept
admonishing
the
women
i
spent
the
seven
days
of
mourning
in
our
basement
where
i
received
visits
from
neighbors
from
the
families
of
my
two
distant
relatives
from
reb
sender
and
other
talmudists
of
my
synagogue
among
these
was
the
pole
this
time
my
rival
begged
my
forgiveness
i
granted
it
of
course
but
i
felt
that
we
never
could
like
each
other
there
was
a
great
wave
of
sympathy
for
me
offers
of
assistance
came
pouring
in
in
all
sorts
of
forms
had
there
been
a
yiddish
newspaper
in
town
and
such
things
as
public
meetings
the
outburst
might
have
crystallized
into
what
to
me
would
have
been
a
great
fortune
as
it
was
public
interest
in
me
died
before
anything
tangible
was
done
still
there
were
several
prosperous
families
of
the
class
each
of
which
wanted
to
provide
me
with
excellent
board
but
then
reb
sender
wife
in
a
fit
of
compassion
and
carried
away
by
the
prevailing
spirit
of
the
moment
claimed
the
sole
right
to
feed
me
i
take
his
mother
place
she
said
whatever
the
upper
one
gives
us
will
be
enough
for
him
too
her
husband
was
happy
while
i
lacked
the
courage
to
overrule
them
as
to
lodgings
it
was
deemed
most
natural
that
i
should
sleep
in
some
house
of
worship
as
thousands
of
talmud
students
did
in
antomir
and
other
towns
to
put
up
with
a
synagogue
bench
for
a
bed
and
to
eat
days
was
even
regarded
as
a
desirable
part
of
a
young
man
talmud
education
and
so
i
selected
a
pew
in
the
preacher
synagogue
for
my
bed
i
was
better
off
than
some
others
who
lived
in
houses
of
god
for
i
had
some
of
my
mother
bedding
while
they
mostly
had
to
sleep
on
hay
pillows
with
a
coat
for
a
blanket
it
was
not
until
i
found
myself
lying
on
this
improvised
bed
that
i
realized
the
full
extent
of
my
calamity
during
the
first
seven
days
of
mourning
i
had
been
aware
of
course
that
something
appalling
had
befallen
me
but
i
had
scarcely
experienced
anything
like
keen
anguish
i
had
been
in
an
excited
hazy
state
of
mind
more
conscious
of
being
the
central
figure
of
a
great
sensation
than
of
my
loss
as
i
went
to
bed
on
the
synagogue
bench
however
instead
of
in
my
old
bunk
at
what
had
been
my
home
the
fact
that
my
mother
was
dead
and
would
never
be
alive
again
smote
me
with
crushing
violence
it
was
as
though
i
had
just
discovered
it
i
shall
never
forget
that
terrible
night
at
the
end
of
the
first
thirty
days
of
mourning
i
visited
grave
mamma
mamma
i
shrieked
throwing
myself
upon
the
mound
in
a
wild
paroxysm
of
grief
the
dinners
which
reb
sender
wife
brought
to
the
synagogue
for
her
husband
and
myself
were
never
quite
enough
for
two
and
for
supper
which
he
had
at
home
she
would
bring
me
some
bread
and
cheese
or
herring
poor
reb
sender
could
not
look
me
in
the
face
the
situation
grew
more
awkward
every
day
it
was
not
long
before
his
wife
began
to
drop
hints
that
i
was
hard
to
please
that
she
did
far
more
than
she
could
afford
for
me
and
that
i
was
an
ingrate
the
upshot
was
that
she
allowed
me
to
accept
days
from
other
families
but
the
people
had
by
now
forgotten
my
existence
and
the
housewives
who
were
still
vying
with
one
another
in
offering
me
meals
were
mostly
of
the
poorer
class
these
strove
to
make
me
feel
at
home
at
their
houses
and
yet
in
some
cases
at
least
as
i
ate
i
was
aware
of
being
watched
lest
i
should
consume
too
much
bread
as
a
consequence
i
often
went
away
half
hungry
all
of
which
quickened
my
and
the
agony
of
my
yearnings
for
mother
i
grew
extremely
sensitive
and
more
quarrelsome
than
i
am
naturally
i
quarreled
with
one
of
my
relatives
a
woman
and
rejected
the
day
which
i
had
had
in
her
house
and
shortly
after
abandoned
one
of
my
other
days
reb
sender
kept
tab
of
my
missing
days
and
tried
to
make
up
for
them
by
sharing
his
dinner
with
me
his
wife
however
who
usually
waited
for
the
dishes
and
so
was
present
while
i
ate
was
anything
but
an
encouraging
witness
of
her
husband
hospitality
the
food
would
stick
in
my
throat
under
her
glances
i
was
repeatedly
impelled
abruptly
to
leave
the
meal
but
refrained
from
doing
so
for
reb
sender
sake
i
obtained
two
new
days
one
of
these
i
soon
forfeited
having
been
caught
stealing
a
hunk
of
bread
but
i
kept
the
matter
from
reb
sender
to
conceal
the
truth
from
him
i
would
spend
the
dinner
hour
in
the
street
or
in
a
little
synagogue
in
another
section
of
the
city
tidy
naphtali
had
recently
returned
to
antomir
and
this
house
of
worship
was
his
home
now
his
vocal
cords
had
been
ruined
by
incessantly
reading
talmud
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
he
now
spoke
or
read
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
he
still
spent
most
of
his
time
at
a
but
he
had
to
content
himself
with
whispering
i
found
a
new
day
but
lost
three
of
my
old
ones
naphtali
had
as
little
to
eat
as
i
yet
he
scarcely
ever
left
his
books
one
late
afternoon
i
sat
by
his
side
while
he
was
reading
in
a
spiritless
whisper
neither
of
us
had
lunched
that
day
his
curly
head
was
propped
upon
his
arm
his
eyes
close
to
the
book
he
never
stirred
he
was
too
faint
to
sway
his
body
or
to
gesticulate
i
was
musing
wearily
and
it
seemed
as
though
my
hunger
was
a
living
thing
and
was
taking
part
in
my
thoughts
do
you
know
naphtali
i
said
it
is
pleasant
even
to
famish
in
company
if
i
were
alone
it
would
be
harder
to
stand
it
misery
of
the
many
is
a
consolation
he
made
no
answer
minutes
passed
presently
he
turned
from
his
desk
do
you
really
think
there
is
a
god
he
asked
irrelevantly
i
stared
do
be
shocked
it
is
all
bosh
and
he
fell
to
swaying
over
his
book
i
was
dumfounded
why
do
you
keep
reading
talmud
then
i
asked
looking
aghast
because
i
am
a
fool
he
returned
going
on
with
his
reading
a
minute
later
he
added
but
you
are
a
bigger
one
i
was
hurt
and
horrified
i
tried
to
argue
but
he
went
on
murmuring
his
eyes
on
the
folio
before
him
finally
i
snapped
you
are
a
horrid
atheist
and
a
sinner
in
israel
you
are
desecrating
the
holy
place
and
i
rushed
from
the
little
synagogue
his
shocking
whisper
do
you
really
think
there
is
a
god
haunted
me
all
that
afternoon
and
evening
he
appeared
like
another
man
to
me
i
was
burning
to
see
him
again
and
to
smash
his
atheism
to
prove
to
him
that
there
was
a
god
but
as
i
made
a
mental
rehearsal
of
my
argument
i
realized
that
i
had
nothing
clear
or
definite
to
put
forth
so
i
cursed
naphtali
for
an
apostate
registered
a
vow
to
shun
him
and
was
looking
forward
to
the
following
day
when
i
should
go
to
see
him
again
my
interest
in
the
matter
was
not
keen
however
and
soon
it
died
down
altogether
nothing
really
interested
me
except
the
fact
that
i
had
not
enough
to
eat
that
mother
was
no
more
that
i
was
all
alone
in
the
world
the
shock
of
the
catastrophe
had
produced
a
striking
effect
on
me
my
incessant
broodings
and
the
corroding
sense
of
my
great
irreparable
loss
and
of
my
desolation
had
made
a
nerveless
listless
wreck
of
me
a
mere
shadow
of
my
former
self
i
was
incapable
of
sustained
thinking
my
communions
with
god
were
quite
rare
now
nor
did
he
take
as
much
interest
in
my
studies
as
he
used
to
instead
of
the
divine
presence
shining
down
on
me
while
i
read
the
face
of
my
martyred
mother
would
loom
before
me
once
or
twice
in
my
hungry
rambles
i
visited
abner
court
and
let
my
heart
be
racked
by
the
sight
of
what
had
once
been
our
home
mother
and
mine
i
said
prayers
for
her
three
times
a
day
with
great
devotion
with
a
deep
yearning
but
this
piety
was
powerless
to
restore
me
to
my
former
feeling
for
the
talmud
i
distinctly
recall
how
i
would
shut
my
eyes
and
vision
my
mother
looking
at
me
from
her
grave
her
heart
contracted
with
anguish
and
pity
for
her
famished
orphan
it
was
an
excruciating
vision
yet
i
found
comfort
in
it
i
would
mutely
complain
of
the
world
to
her
it
would
give
me
satisfaction
to
denounce
the
whole
town
to
her
ah
i
have
got
you
i
seemed
to
say
to
the
people
of
antomir
the
ghost
of
my
mother
and
the
whole
other
world
see
you
in
all
your
heartlessness
you
ca
wriggle
out
of
it
this
was
my
revenge
i
reveled
in
it
but
nothing
daunted
the
people
of
antomir
would
go
about
their
business
as
usual
and
my
heart
would
sink
with
a
sense
of
my
helplessness
i
was
restless
i
coveted
diversion
company
and
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
naphtali
as
for
his
free
thought
it
soon
after
we
had
two
mild
quarrels
over
it
began
to
bore
me
it
appeared
that
the
huge
tomes
of
the
talmud
were
not
the
only
books
he
read
these
days
he
spent
much
time
clandestinely
on
little
books
written
in
the
holy
tongue
on
any
but
holy
topics
they
were
taken
up
with
such
things
as
modern
science
poetry
fiction
and
above
all
criticism
of
our
faith
he
made
some
attempts
to
lure
me
into
an
interest
in
these
books
but
without
avail
the
only
thing
connected
with
them
that
appealed
to
me
were
the
anecdotes
that
naphtali
would
tell
me
in
his
laconic
way
concerning
their
authors
i
scarcely
ever
listened
to
these
stories
without
invoking
imprecations
upon
the
infidels
but
i
enjoyed
them
all
the
same
they
were
mostly
concerned
with
their
apostasy
but
there
were
many
that
were
not
some
of
these
or
rather
the
fact
that
i
had
first
heard
them
from
naphtali
in
my
youth
were
destined
to
have
a
peculiar
bearing
on
an
important
event
in
my
life
on
something
that
occurred
many
years
later
when
i
was
already
a
prosperous
merchant
in
new
york
they
were
about
doctor
rachaeles
a
famous
hebrew
writer
who
practised
medicine
in
odessa
and
his
a
poet
named
abraham
tevkin
doctor
rachaeles
daughter
was
a
celebrated
beauty
and
the
poet
courtship
of
her
had
been
in
the
form
of
a
long
series
of
passionate
letters
addressed
not
to
his
but
to
her
father
this
made
a
strong
impression
on
me
the
figures
of
the
beautiful
girl
and
of
the
enamoured
young
poet
as
i
pictured
them
were
vivid
in
my
mind
did
he
write
of
his
love
in
those
letters
i
demanded
shyly
he
did
not
write
of
onions
did
he
naphtali
retorted
after
a
little
i
asked
but
how
could
she
read
those
letters
she
certainly
does
not
read
holy
tongue
go
ask
her
you
a
funny
fellow
did
tevkin
get
the
girl
he
did
and
they
have
been
married
for
many
years
why
did
you
wonder
if
you
might
have
a
chance
you
impossible
naphtali
he
smiled
chapter
ii
one
afternoon
naphtali
called
on
me
at
the
preacher
synagogue
have
you
got
all
your
he
asked
in
his
whisper
why
he
had
discovered
a
treasure
a
pious
rich
elderly
woman
whose
latest
hobby
was
to
care
for
at
least
eighteen
poor
talmudists
eighteen
being
the
numerical
value
of
the
letters
composing
the
hebrew
word
for
life
her
name
was
shiphrah
minsker
she
belonged
to
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
antomir
and
her
husband
was
equally
her
religious
zeal
was
of
recent
origin
in
fact
and
even
now
she
wore
her
hair
gentile
fashion
it
was
a
great
sin
but
she
had
never
worn
a
wig
in
her
life
and
putting
on
one
now
seemed
to
be
out
of
the
question
this
hair
of
hers
was
of
a
hue
threaded
with
silver
and
it
grew
in
a
tousled
abundance
of
unruly
wisps
that
seemed
to
be
symbolic
of
her
character
she
was
as
pugnacious
as
she
was
charitable
and
as
quick
to
make
up
a
quarrel
as
to
pick
one
her
husband
michael
minsker
was
a
worldly
man
with
only
a
smattering
of
talmud
and
their
younger
children
were
being
educated
at
the
russian
schools
but
they
all
humored
her
newly
adopted
ways
to
a
certain
extent
at
least
while
she
tolerated
their
gentile
ones
as
she
did
her
own
uncovered
hair
relegating
her
household
affairs
to
a
devoted
old
servant
with
whom
she
was
forever
wrangling
shiphrah
spent
most
of
her
time
raising
contributions
to
her
various
charity
funds
looking
after
her
talmud
students
quarreling
with
her
numerous
friends
and
begging
their
forgiveness
if
she
was
unable
to
provide
meals
for
a
student
in
the
houses
of
some
people
of
her
acquaintance
she
paid
for
his
board
out
of
her
own
purse
her
husband
was
an
exporter
of
grain
and
his
business
often
took
him
to
koenigsberg
prussia
for
several
weeks
at
a
time
occasions
of
this
kind
were
hailed
by
shiphrah
as
a
godsend
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
term
for
in
his
absence
she
could
freely
spend
on
her
beneficiaries
and
even
feed
some
of
them
at
her
own
house
when
i
was
introduced
to
her
as
the
son
of
the
woman
who
had
been
killed
on
the
and
she
heard
that
i
frequently
had
nothing
to
eat
she
burst
into
tears
and
berated
me
soundly
for
not
having
knocked
at
her
door
sooner
it
terrible
it
terrible
she
moaned
breaking
into
tears
again
in
fact
i
too
deserve
a
spanking
to
think
that
i
did
not
look
him
up
at
once
when
that
awful
thing
happened
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
had
not
done
so
because
at
the
time
of
my
mother
death
her
house
had
been
agog
with
a
trouble
of
its
own
but
of
this
presently
she
handed
me
a
bill
and
set
about
filling
up
the
gaps
in
my
eating
calendar
and
substituting
fat
days
for
lean
ones
she
often
came
to
see
me
at
the
synagogue
never
now
she
had
a
silver
coin
for
me
now
a
pair
of
socks
a
shirt
or
perhaps
a
pair
of
trousers
which
some
member
of
her
family
had
discarded
often
too
she
would
bring
me
a
quarter
of
a
chicken
cookies
or
some
other
article
of
food
from
her
own
table
my
days
of
hunger
were
at
an
end
i
lived
in
clover
now
i
can
work
i
thought
to
myself
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
stomach
and
work
i
will
i
show
people
what
i
can
do
i
applied
myself
to
my
task
with
ardor
but
it
did
not
last
long
my
former
interest
in
the
talmud
was
gone
the
spell
was
broken
irretrievably
now
that
i
did
not
want
for
food
my
sense
of
loneliness
became
keener
than
ever
indeed
it
was
a
novel
sense
of
loneliness
quite
unlike
the
one
i
had
experienced
before
my
surroundings
had
somehow
lost
their
former
meaning
life
was
devoid
of
savor
and
i
was
thirsting
for
an
appetizer
as
it
were
for
some
violent
change
for
piquant
sensations
then
it
was
that
the
word
america
first
caught
my
fancy
the
name
was
buzzing
all
around
me
the
great
emigration
of
jews
to
the
united
states
which
had
received
its
first
impulse
two
or
three
years
before
was
already
in
full
swing
it
may
not
be
out
of
order
to
relate
briefly
how
it
had
all
come
about
an
riot
broke
out
in
a
southern
town
named
elisabethgrad
in
the
early
spring
of
occurrences
of
this
kind
were
in
those
days
quite
rare
in
russia
and
when
they
did
happen
they
did
not
extend
beyond
the
town
of
their
origin
but
the
circumstances
that
surrounded
the
elisabethgrad
outbreak
were
of
a
specific
character
it
took
place
one
month
after
the
assassination
of
the
czar
alexander
ii
the
actual
size
and
influence
of
the
underground
revolutionary
organization
being
an
unknown
quantity
petersburg
was
full
of
the
rumblings
of
a
general
uprising
the
elisabethgrad
riot
however
was
not
of
a
revolutionary
nature
yet
the
police
so
far
from
suppressing
it
encouraged
it
the
example
of
the
elisabethgrad
rabble
was
followed
by
the
riffraff
of
other
places
the
epidemic
quickly
spread
from
city
to
city
whereupon
the
scenes
of
lawlessness
in
the
various
cities
were
marked
by
the
same
method
in
the
mob
madness
by
the
same
connivance
on
the
part
of
the
police
and
by
many
other
traits
that
clearly
pointed
to
a
common
source
of
inspiration
it
has
long
since
become
a
historical
fact
that
the
disturbances
were
encouraged
even
arranged
by
the
authorities
as
an
outlet
for
the
growing
popular
discontent
with
the
government
count
von
plehve
was
then
at
the
head
of
the
police
department
in
the
ministry
of
the
interior
this
bit
of
history
repeated
itself
on
a
larger
scale
years
later
when
russia
was
in
the
paroxysm
of
a
real
revolution
and
when
the
ghastly
massacres
of
jews
in
kishineff
odessa
kieff
and
other
cities
were
among
the
means
employed
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
masses
busy
count
von
plehve
then
held
the
office
of
prime
minister
to
return
to
and
thousands
of
jewish
families
were
left
homeless
of
still
greater
moment
was
the
moral
effect
which
the
atrocities
produced
on
the
whole
jewish
population
of
russia
over
five
million
people
were
suddenly
made
to
realize
that
their
birthplace
was
not
their
home
a
feeling
which
the
great
russian
revolution
has
suddenly
changed
then
it
was
that
the
cry
to
america
was
raised
it
spread
like
even
over
those
parts
of
the
pale
of
jewish
settlement
which
lay
outside
the
riot
zone
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
great
new
exodus
that
has
been
in
progress
for
decades
my
native
town
and
the
entire
section
to
which
it
belongs
had
been
immune
from
the
riots
yet
it
caught
the
general
contagion
and
at
the
time
i
became
one
of
shiphrah
wards
hundreds
of
its
inhabitants
were
going
to
america
or
planning
to
do
so
letters
full
of
wonders
from
emigrants
already
there
went
the
rounds
of
eager
readers
and
listeners
until
they
were
worn
to
shreds
in
the
process
i
succumbed
to
the
spreading
fever
it
was
one
of
these
letters
from
america
in
fact
which
put
the
notion
of
emigrating
to
the
new
world
definitely
in
my
mind
an
illiterate
woman
brought
it
to
the
synagogue
to
have
it
read
to
her
and
i
happened
to
be
the
one
to
whom
she
addressed
her
request
the
concrete
details
of
that
letter
gave
new
york
tangible
form
in
my
imagination
it
haunted
me
ever
after
the
united
states
lured
me
not
merely
as
a
land
of
milk
and
honey
but
also
and
perhaps
chiefly
as
one
of
mystery
of
fantastic
experiences
of
marvelous
transformations
to
leave
my
native
place
and
to
seek
my
fortune
in
that
distant
weird
world
seemed
to
be
just
the
kind
of
sensational
adventure
my
heart
was
hankering
for
when
i
unburdened
myself
of
my
project
to
reb
sender
he
was
thunderstruck
to
america
he
said
lord
of
the
world
but
one
becomes
a
gentile
there
not
at
all
i
sought
to
reassure
him
there
are
lots
of
good
jews
there
and
they
do
neglect
their
talmud
either
the
amount
that
was
necessary
to
take
me
to
america
loomed
staggeringly
large
where
was
it
to
come
from
i
thought
of
approaching
shiphrah
but
the
idea
of
her
helping
me
abandon
my
talmud
and
go
to
live
in
a
godless
country
seemed
preposterous
so
i
began
by
saving
the
small
allowance
which
i
received
from
her
and
by
selling
some
of
the
clothes
and
food
she
brought
me
for
the
evening
meal
i
usually
received
some
rye
bread
and
a
small
coin
for
cheese
or
herring
so
i
invariably
added
the
coin
to
my
little
hoard
relishing
the
bread
with
thoughts
of
america
while
i
was
thus
pinching
and
saving
pennies
i
was
continually
casting
about
for
some
more
effective
way
of
raising
the
sum
that
would
take
me
to
new
york
i
confided
my
plan
to
naphtali
not
a
bad
idea
he
said
but
you
will
never
raise
the
money
you
are
a
master
of
dreams
david
i
get
the
money
and
what
is
more
when
i
am
in
america
i
shall
bring
you
over
there
too
may
your
words
pass
from
your
lips
into
the
ear
of
god
i
thought
you
did
not
believe
in
god
how
long
will
you
believe
in
him
after
you
get
to
america
book
iv
matilda
chapter
i
i
could
scarcely
think
of
anything
but
america
i
read
every
letter
from
there
that
i
could
obtain
i
was
constantly
seeking
information
about
the
country
and
the
opportunities
it
held
out
to
a
man
of
my
type
and
cudgeling
my
brains
for
some
way
of
scraping
together
the
formidable
sum
i
was
restless
sleepless
and
finally
when
i
caught
a
slight
cold
my
health
broke
down
so
completely
that
i
had
to
be
taken
to
the
hospital
shiphrah
visited
me
every
day
calling
me
poor
orphan
boy
and
quarreling
with
the
superintendent
over
me
one
afternoon
after
i
had
been
discharged
when
she
saw
me
at
the
synagogue
feeble
and
emaciated
she
gasped
you
a
cruel
heartless
man
she
flared
up
addressing
herself
to
the
beadle
the
poor
boy
needs
a
good
soft
bed
fine
chicken
soup
and
real
care
why
did
you
let
me
know
at
once
come
on
david
where
to
i
inquired
timidly
none
of
your
business
come
on
i
not
going
to
take
you
to
the
woods
you
may
be
sure
of
that
i
want
you
to
stay
in
my
house
until
you
are
well
rested
and
strong
enough
to
study
do
you
like
it
she
added
with
a
wink
to
the
beadle
it
appeared
that
her
husband
was
away
on
one
of
his
prolonged
business
excursions
otherwise
installing
in
her
modern
home
an
ridiculous
young
creature
like
a
talmud
student
would
have
been
out
of
the
question
i
followed
her
with
heart
i
knew
that
her
family
was
modern
that
her
children
spoke
russian
and
behaved
like
gentiles
that
there
was
a
grown
young
woman
among
them
and
that
her
name
was
matilda
the
case
of
this
young
woman
had
been
the
talk
of
the
town
the
year
before
she
had
been
persuaded
to
marry
a
man
for
whom
she
did
not
care
and
shortly
after
the
wedding
and
after
a
sensational
passage
at
arms
between
his
people
and
hers
she
made
her
father
pay
him
a
small
fortune
for
divorcing
her
matilda
family
being
one
of
the
upper
ten
in
our
town
its
members
were
frequently
the
subject
of
envious
gossip
and
so
i
had
known
a
good
deal
about
them
even
before
shiphrah
befriended
me
i
had
heard
for
example
that
matilda
had
received
her
early
education
in
a
in
germany
in
accordance
with
a
custom
that
had
been
in
existence
among
people
of
her
father
class
until
recently
that
she
had
subsequently
studied
russian
and
other
subjects
under
russian
tutors
at
home
and
that
her
two
brothers
who
were
younger
than
she
were
at
the
local
russian
gymnasium
or
high
school
i
had
heard
also
that
matilda
was
very
pretty
that
she
was
well
dressed
went
without
saying
all
this
both
fascinated
and
cowed
me
suddenly
shiphrah
paused
as
though
bethinking
herself
of
something
wait
do
stir
she
said
rushing
back
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
later
she
returned
saying
i
was
not
long
was
i
i
just
went
to
get
the
beadle
forgiveness
had
insulted
him
for
nothing
but
he
a
dummy
all
the
same
come
on
david
arrived
at
her
house
she
introduced
me
to
her
old
servant
in
the
kitchen
he
stay
a
week
with
us
perhaps
more
she
explained
i
want
you
to
build
him
up
fatten
him
up
like
a
passover
goose
do
you
hear
the
servant
a
tall
spare
woman
with
an
extremely
dark
face
tinged
with
blue
began
by
darting
hostile
glances
at
me
look
at
the
way
she
is
staring
at
him
shiphrah
growled
he
is
the
son
of
the
woman
who
was
murdered
at
the
the
old
servant
started
is
he
she
said
aghast
are
you
pleased
now
will
you
take
good
care
of
him
may
the
uppermost
give
him
a
good
appetite
as
shiphrah
led
me
from
the
kitchen
into
another
room
she
said
she
took
a
fancy
to
you
it
will
be
all
right
she
towed
me
into
a
vast
so
crowded
with
new
furniture
that
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
there
were
many
rooms
in
the
apartment
and
they
all
produced
a
similar
impression
i
subsequently
learned
that
the
superabundance
of
sofas
chests
of
drawers
chairs
or
was
due
to
shiphrah
passion
for
bargains
a
weakness
which
made
her
the
fair
game
of
tradespeople
and
artisans
several
of
her
wardrobes
and
bureaus
were
packed
full
of
all
sorts
of
things
for
which
she
had
no
earthly
use
and
many
of
which
she
had
smuggled
in
when
her
husband
and
the
children
were
out
ensconced
in
a
corner
of
an
enormous
green
sofa
in
the
big
crowded
with
a
book
in
her
lap
we
found
a
young
woman
with
curly
brown
hair
and
sparkling
brown
eyes
set
in
a
small
oval
face
she
looked
no
more
than
twenty
but
when
her
mother
addressed
her
as
matilda
i
knew
that
i
was
facing
the
heroine
of
the
sensational
divorce
she
was
singularly
interesting
but
pretty
she
certainly
was
not
her
gentile
name
had
a
world
of
charm
for
my
ear
one
of
the
trifles
that
clung
to
my
memory
is
the
fact
that
upon
seeing
her
i
felt
something
like
amazement
at
her
girlish
appearance
i
had
had
a
notion
that
a
married
woman
no
matter
how
young
must
have
a
married
face
something
quite
distinct
from
the
countenance
of
a
maiden
while
this
married
woman
did
not
begin
to
look
married
matilda
got
up
cast
a
frowning
at
her
mother
and
walked
over
to
one
of
the
four
immense
windows
illuminating
the
room
less
than
a
minute
later
she
turned
around
and
crossed
over
to
her
mother
side
she
was
small
but
well
made
and
her
movements
were
brisk
firm
elastic
come
on
mother
there
something
i
want
to
tell
you
she
said
a
jerk
of
her
curly
head
indicating
the
adjoining
room
i
have
no
secrets
shiphrah
growled
what
do
you
want
a
snappish
whispered
conference
ensued
the
trend
of
which
was
at
once
betrayed
in
an
acrimonious
retort
by
shiphrah
just
keep
your
foolish
nose
out
of
my
affairs
will
you
when
i
say
he
is
going
to
stay
here
for
some
time
i
mean
it
do
you
mind
her
david
mother
mother
mother
matilda
trilled
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
and
flounced
out
of
the
room
i
felt
my
face
turning
all
colors
and
at
the
same
time
her
mother
mother
mother
instead
of
mamma
mamma
mamma
was
echoing
in
my
brain
enchantingly
presently
a
youth
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
came
in
apparently
attracted
by
his
mother
angry
voice
he
wore
a
blue
coat
with
silver
lace
and
silver
buttons
the
uniform
of
a
russian
high
school
which
sent
a
flutter
of
mixed
envy
and
awe
through
me
he
threw
a
frowning
glance
at
me
and
withdrew
two
smaller
children
a
uniformed
boy
and
a
little
girl
made
their
appearance
talking
in
russian
noisily
at
sight
of
me
they
fell
silent
looked
me
over
from
my
to
the
edge
of
my
coat
and
then
took
to
whispering
and
giggling
clear
out
you
devils
shiphrah
shouted
stamping
her
foot
shoo
a
young
chambermaid
passed
through
the
room
and
shiphrah
stopped
her
long
enough
to
introduce
me
and
to
command
her
to
look
after
me
as
if
i
were
one
of
the
family
even
better
chapter
ii
the
spacious
was
used
as
a
as
well
it
was
in
this
room
on
the
enormous
green
sofa
that
my
bed
was
made
for
the
night
it
was
by
far
the
most
comfortable
bed
i
had
ever
slept
in
early
the
next
morning
after
i
finished
my
long
prayer
and
had
put
away
my
phylacteries
the
young
chambermaid
removed
the
bedding
and
the
swarthy
old
servant
served
me
my
breakfast
go
wash
your
hands
and
eat
in
good
health
eat
hearty
and
may
it
well
agree
with
you
she
said
with
a
compound
of
deep
commiseration
reverence
and
disdain
i
went
to
the
kitchen
where
i
washed
my
hands
and
while
wiping
them
muttered
the
brief
prayer
which
one
offers
before
eating
as
i
returned
to
the
i
found
matilda
there
she
was
seated
at
some
distance
from
the
table
upon
which
my
breakfast
was
spread
she
wore
a
sort
of
white
kimono
one
did
not
have
to
stand
on
ceremony
with
a
fellow
who
did
not
even
wear
a
stiff
collar
and
a
necktie
nor
did
i
know
enough
to
resent
her
costume
she
did
not
order
anything
to
eat
for
herself
not
even
a
glass
of
tea
it
seemed
as
though
she
had
come
in
for
the
express
purpose
of
eying
me
out
of
countenance
if
she
had
she
succeeded
but
too
well
her
silent
glances
fell
on
me
like
splashes
of
hot
water
i
was
so
disconcerted
i
could
not
swallow
my
food
there
were
centuries
of
difference
between
her
and
myself
not
to
speak
of
the
economic
chasm
that
separated
us
to
me
she
was
an
aristocrat
while
i
was
a
poor
wretched
day
eater
a
cross
between
a
beggar
and
a
recluse
i
dared
not
even
look
at
her
talmud
students
were
expected
to
be
the
shyest
creatures
under
the
sun
on
this
occasion
i
certainly
was
the
other
children
entered
the
room
they
were
dressing
themselves
eating
and
studying
their
gentile
lessons
all
at
once
matilda
had
a
mild
altercation
with
yeffim
her
brother
ordered
breakfast
for
herself
and
seemed
to
have
forgotten
my
existence
her
mother
came
in
and
took
to
cloying
me
with
food
at
about
in
the
afternoon
i
was
alone
in
the
i
stood
at
the
piano
the
first
i
had
ever
laid
eyes
on
timidly
sounding
some
of
the
keys
when
i
heard
approaching
voices
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
rushed
over
to
the
nearest
window
where
i
paused
feigning
interest
in
some
passing
peasant
teams
presently
matilda
made
her
appearance
accompanied
by
two
girl
friends
the
three
young
women
were
chattering
in
russian
a
language
of
which
i
understood
scarcely
three
dozen
words
i
could
conjecture
however
that
the
subject
of
their
talk
was
no
other
than
my
own
quailing
personality
suddenly
matilda
addressed
herself
to
me
in
yiddish
look
here
young
man
do
you
know
it
is
bad
manners
for
a
gentleman
to
stand
with
his
back
to
ladies
i
faced
about
all
flushed
and
scared
that
better
she
said
gaily
never
mind
staring
at
the
floor
give
us
a
look
will
you
do
act
as
a
shy
bridegroom
i
made
no
answer
the
room
seemed
to
be
in
a
whirl
why
do
you
speak
matilda
insisted
concealing
her
quizzical
purpose
under
a
air
of
gravity
her
two
friends
roared
and
spurred
on
by
their
merriment
she
continued
to
make
game
of
me
wo
you
give
us
one
look
at
least
do
please
come
my
mother
will
never
find
out
you
have
been
guilty
of
a
great
sin
like
that
i
was
dying
to
get
up
and
fling
out
of
the
room
but
i
felt
glued
to
the
spot
their
cruel
sport
which
made
me
faint
with
embarrassment
and
misery
had
something
inexpressibly
alluring
in
it
one
of
the
two
girls
said
something
in
russian
of
which
i
caught
the
word
kiss
and
which
was
greeted
by
a
new
outburst
of
laughter
i
was
well
pious
jew
matilda
resumed
suppose
a
girl
were
to
give
you
a
kiss
what
would
you
do
commit
suicide
would
you
well
never
fear
we
wo
be
as
cruel
as
all
that
i
tell
you
what
though
hide
your
behind
your
ears
i
just
want
to
see
how
you
would
look
without
them
at
this
she
stepped
up
close
to
me
and
reached
out
her
hands
for
my
two
appendages
i
pushed
her
off
please
let
me
alone
i
protested
at
last
we
have
heard
his
voice
bravo
we
making
headway
are
we
at
this
point
her
mother
angry
voice
made
itself
heard
matilda
desisted
with
a
merry
remark
to
her
friends
the
next
morning
when
she
and
i
were
alone
she
tantalized
me
again
she
made
another
attempt
to
tuck
my
behind
my
ears
as
we
were
alone
i
had
more
courage
if
you
do
stop
i
go
away
from
here
i
said
in
a
rage
what
do
you
want
of
me
as
i
thus
gave
vent
to
my
resentment
i
instinctively
felt
that
so
far
from
causing
her
to
avoid
me
it
would
quicken
her
rompish
interest
in
me
and
i
hoped
it
would
do
yell
she
said
startled
ca
you
take
a
joke
a
nice
joke
that
very
well
i
wo
do
it
again
i
did
know
you
were
a
after
a
pause
she
resumed
in
grave
friendly
accents
come
do
be
angry
i
want
to
talk
to
you
look
here
is
there
any
sense
in
your
wasting
your
life
the
way
you
do
look
at
the
way
you
are
dressed
the
way
you
live
generally
besides
the
idea
of
a
young
man
like
you
not
being
able
to
speak
a
word
of
russian
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
why
mother
says
you
are
remarkably
bright
is
it
a
pity
that
you
should
throw
it
all
away
why
do
you
try
to
study
russian
geography
history
why
do
you
try
to
become
an
educated
man
the
idea
i
said
with
a
laugh
my
confusion
was
gone
partly
at
least
i
looked
her
full
in
the
face
she
flared
up
the
idea
she
mocked
me
rather
say
idea
of
a
bright
young
fellow
being
so
ignorant
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
provoking
thing
like
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
her
explosiveness
in
her
now
that
i
had
scanned
her
features
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
she
was
a
married
woman
i
read
that
fact
into
them
she
did
look
married
i
remarked
to
myself
her
exposed
hair
gave
her
an
effect
of
aristocratic
wickedness
and
wantonness
which
repelled
and
drew
me
at
once
she
was
a
girl
and
yet
she
was
a
married
woman
this
duality
of
hers
deepened
the
fascinating
mystery
of
the
distance
between
us
she
proceeded
to
draw
me
out
she
made
me
tell
her
the
story
of
my
young
life
and
i
obeyed
her
but
too
willingly
i
told
her
my
whole
tale
of
woe
reveling
in
my
own
rehearsal
of
my
sufferings
and
more
especially
in
the
expressions
of
horror
and
heartfelt
pity
which
it
elicited
from
her
my
god
my
god
she
cried
gasping
and
wringing
her
hands
poor
boy
or
oh
i
ca
hear
it
i
ca
hear
it
it
is
enough
to
drive
one
crazy
at
one
point
as
i
described
the
pangs
of
hunger
which
i
had
often
borne
there
were
tears
in
her
interesting
eyes
when
i
had
finished
my
story
flushed
with
a
sense
of
my
histrionic
success
she
ordered
tea
and
preserves
as
though
to
indemnify
me
for
my
past
sufferings
all
the
more
reason
for
you
to
study
russian
and
to
become
an
educated
man
she
said
as
she
put
sugar
into
my
glass
she
cited
the
cases
of
former
talmudists
poor
and
friendless
like
myself
who
had
studied
at
the
universities
fighting
every
inch
of
their
way
till
they
had
achieved
success
as
physicians
lawyers
writers
she
spoke
passionately
often
with
the
absurd
acerbity
of
her
mother
it
a
crime
for
a
young
man
like
you
to
throw
himself
away
on
that
idiotic
talmud
of
yours
she
said
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
fiercely
all
this
sounded
shockingly
wicked
and
yet
it
did
not
shock
me
in
the
least
i
have
a
plan
i
said
when
she
heard
what
i
wanted
to
do
she
shook
her
head
and
frowned
she
said
in
substance
that
america
was
a
land
of
dollars
not
of
education
and
that
she
wanted
me
to
be
an
educated
man
i
assured
her
that
i
should
study
english
in
america
and
after
i
had
laid
up
some
money
prepare
for
college
there
she
could
have
made
me
promise
anything
but
colleges
in
which
the
instruction
was
not
in
russian
failed
to
appeal
to
her
imagination
still
when
she
saw
that
my
heart
was
set
on
the
project
she
yielded
she
seemed
to
like
the
fervor
with
which
i
defended
my
cause
and
the
notion
of
my
going
to
a
land
was
apparently
beginning
to
have
its
effect
i
was
the
hero
of
an
adventure
gradually
she
became
quite
enthusiastic
about
my
plan
i
tell
you
what
i
can
raise
the
money
for
you
she
said
with
a
gesture
of
sudden
resolution
how
much
is
it
when
i
said
forlornly
that
it
would
come
to
about
eighty
rubles
she
declared
gravely
that
all
right
i
shall
get
it
for
you
only
say
nothing
to
mother
about
it
i
thought
myself
in
a
flurry
of
joy
over
this
windfall
but
a
little
later
when
i
was
left
to
myself
i
became
aware
that
the
flurry
i
was
in
was
of
quite
a
different
nature
when
i
tried
to
think
of
america
i
found
that
my
ambition
in
that
direction
had
lost
its
former
vitality
i
was
deeply
in
love
with
matilda
chapter
iii
she
continued
to
treat
me
in
a
patronizing
playful
way
but
we
were
supposed
to
be
great
friends
and
i
asked
myself
no
questions
the
money
is
assured
she
once
announced
you
shall
get
it
in
a
few
days
you
may
begin
to
pack
your
great
baggage
she
jested
my
heart
sank
within
me
but
i
feigned
exultation
do
you
deserve
it
pious
soul
that
you
are
she
laughed
and
casting
a
glance
at
my
she
added
i
do
wish
you
would
cut
off
those
horrid
things
of
yours
you
wo
take
them
to
america
will
you
i
smiled
small
as
was
my
stock
of
information
of
the
new
world
i
knew
enough
of
it
to
understand
in
a
general
way
that
were
out
of
place
there
she
proceeded
to
put
my
behind
my
ears
and
this
time
i
did
not
object
she
then
smoothed
them
down
the
touch
of
her
fingers
thrilling
me
through
and
through
then
she
brought
a
and
made
me
look
at
myself
do
you
see
the
difference
she
demanded
if
you
were
not
rigged
out
like
the
savage
that
you
are
you
would
be
a
fellow
after
all
why
girls
might
even
fall
in
love
with
you
but
then
what
does
a
pious
soul
like
you
know
about
such
things
as
love
how
do
you
know
i
do
i
ventured
to
say
blushing
like
a
poppy
do
you
really
she
said
with
mischievous
surprise
i
nodded
well
well
so
you
are
not
quite
so
saintly
as
i
thought
you
were
perhaps
you
have
even
been
in
love
yourself
have
you
tell
me
i
kept
silent
my
heart
was
throbbing
wildly
do
you
love
me
i
nodded
once
more
my
heart
stood
still
kiss
me
then
she
put
my
arms
around
her
made
me
clasp
her
to
my
breast
and
we
kissed
passionately
i
suddenly
felt
ten
years
older
she
broke
away
from
me
jumping
around
slapping
her
hands
and
bubbling
over
with
triumphant
mirth
as
she
shouted
there
is
a
pious
soul
for
you
there
is
a
pious
soul
for
you
a
thought
of
little
red
esther
of
my
childhood
days
flashed
through
my
brain
of
the
way
she
would
force
me
to
sin
and
then
gloat
over
my
fall
a
penny
for
your
piety
matilda
added
gravely
when
you
are
in
america
you
dress
like
a
gentile
and
even
shave
then
you
wo
look
so
ridiculous
good
clothes
would
make
another
man
of
you
at
this
she
looked
me
over
in
a
sort
of
way
pretty
good
figure
that
she
concluded
in
the
evening
of
that
day
when
there
was
company
in
the
house
she
bore
herself
as
though
she
did
not
know
me
but
the
next
morning
after
the
children
had
gone
to
school
and
her
mother
was
away
on
her
various
missions
she
made
me
put
on
the
glittering
coat
and
cap
of
her
brother
sunday
uniform
it
rather
too
small
for
you
but
it
becoming
all
the
same
she
said
enthusiastically
if
mamma
came
in
now
she
would
not
know
you
but
then
there
would
be
a
nice
if
she
did
she
gave
a
titter
which
rolled
through
my
very
heart
well
gymnasist
note
are
you
really
in
love
with
me
do
make
fun
of
me
pray
i
implored
her
it
hurts
you
know
very
well
i
but
you
have
answered
my
question
what
question
what
a
poor
memory
you
have
and
yet
mother
says
you
have
good
head
try
to
remember
i
do
remember
your
question
then
what
is
your
answer
yes
yes
she
mocked
me
that
not
the
way
gentlemen
declare
their
love
what
else
shall
i
say
what
else
well
say
am
ready
to
die
for
you
you
are
the
sunshine
of
my
life
are
the
sunshine
of
my
life
i
echoed
with
a
smile
that
was
a
combination
of
mirth
and
resentment
are
my
happiness
my
soul
the
world
would
be
dark
without
you
i
am
no
baby
to
parrot
somebody
else
words
then
you
do
love
me
yes
i
do
but
i
hate
to
be
made
fun
of
do
please
do
i
said
it
with
a
beseeching
passionate
tremor
in
my
voice
and
all
at
once
i
clasped
her
violently
to
me
and
was
about
to
kiss
her
she
put
up
her
lips
responsively
but
suddenly
she
wrenched
herself
back
easy
easy
you
saintly
talmudist
she
said
you
must
not
forget
that
you
are
not
a
gymnasist
that
to
kiss
a
woman
is
a
sin
a
great
sin
you
be
beaten
with
rods
of
iron
in
the
world
to
come
well
she
concluded
gravely
i
must
go
take
off
that
coat
and
cap
mamma
may
come
in
at
any
moment
she
showed
me
where
to
hang
them
note
gymnasist
a
pupil
of
a
gymnasium
or
high
school
chapter
iv
in
my
incessant
reveries
of
her
i
developed
the
theory
that
if
i
abandoned
my
plan
about
going
to
america
she
would
have
her
father
send
me
to
college
with
a
view
to
my
marrying
her
indeed
matches
of
this
kind
were
not
an
unusual
arrangement
in
our
town
nor
are
they
in
the
jewish
districts
of
new
york
philadelphia
boston
or
chicago
for
example
my
bed
was
usually
made
on
the
enormous
green
sofa
in
the
spacious
one
night
when
i
was
asleep
on
that
great
sofa
i
was
suddenly
aroused
by
the
touch
of
a
hand
i
heard
matilda
whisper
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
sleep
anyhow
i
do
know
why
so
i
was
thinking
of
all
kinds
of
things
till
i
came
to
your
plan
about
america
it
is
foolish
why
go
so
far
perhaps
something
can
be
done
to
get
you
into
high
school
and
then
into
the
university
i
have
guessed
it
right
then
i
exclaimed
within
myself
the
room
was
her
white
kimono
was
all
i
could
see
of
her
she
explained
certain
details
she
spoke
in
a
very
low
undertone
with
great
earnestness
i
took
her
by
the
hand
and
drew
her
down
to
a
seat
on
the
edge
of
the
sofa
beside
me
she
offered
no
resistance
she
continued
to
talk
partly
in
the
same
undertone
partly
in
whispers
with
her
hand
remaining
in
mine
i
was
aflame
with
happiness
yet
i
listened
intently
i
felt
sure
that
she
was
my
that
it
was
only
a
matter
of
days
when
our
engagement
would
be
celebrated
my
heart
went
out
to
her
with
a
passion
that
seemed
to
be
sanctioned
by
god
and
men
i
strained
down
her
head
and
kissed
her
but
that
was
the
stainless
kiss
of
a
man
yearning
upon
the
lips
of
his
betrothed
i
clasped
her
flimsily
garmented
form
kissed
her
again
and
again
let
her
kiss
and
bite
me
and
still
it
all
seemed
legitimate
or
nearly
so
i
saw
in
it
an
emphatic
confirmation
of
my
feeling
that
she
did
not
regard
herself
a
stranger
to
me
that
mattered
more
than
anything
else
at
this
moment
you
a
devil
she
whispered
slapping
me
on
both
cheeks
a
devil
with
and
she
broke
into
a
suppressed
laugh
i
study
as
hard
as
i
can
i
assured
her
with
boyish
exultation
you
see
what
i
can
do
the
gentile
books
are
child
play
in
comparison
with
the
talmud
i
went
into
details
she
took
no
part
in
my
talk
but
she
let
me
go
on
i
became
so
absorbed
in
what
i
was
saying
that
my
caresses
ceased
i
sat
up
and
spoke
quite
audibly
she
cautioned
me
in
an
irritated
whisper
i
dropped
my
voice
she
listened
for
another
minute
or
two
and
then
suddenly
rising
she
said
oh
you
are
a
talmud
student
after
all
and
her
indistinct
kimono
vanished
in
the
darkness
i
felt
crushed
but
i
was
sure
that
the
words
talmud
student
which
are
yiddish
for
ninny
merely
referred
to
my
rendering
our
confab
dangerous
by
speaking
too
loud
the
next
afternoon
she
kissed
me
once
more
calling
me
talmud
student
again
but
she
was
apparently
getting
somewhat
fidgety
about
our
relations
she
was
more
guarded
more
on
the
alert
for
eavesdroppers
as
though
somebody
had
become
suspicious
my
gentile
education
she
never
broached
again
finally
when
a
letter
came
from
her
father
announcing
his
speedy
return
and
shiphrah
hastened
to
terminate
my
stay
at
the
house
matilda
was
obviously
glad
to
have
me
go
i
shall
bring
you
the
money
to
the
synagogue
she
whispered
as
i
was
about
to
leave
i
was
stunned
i
left
in
a
turmoil
of
misery
and
perplexity
yet
not
in
despair
when
i
returned
to
the
synagogue
everybody
and
everything
in
it
looked
strange
to
me
reb
sender
was
dearer
than
ever
but
that
was
chiefly
because
i
was
longing
for
a
devoted
friend
i
was
dying
to
relieve
my
fevered
mind
by
telling
him
all
and
seeking
advice
but
i
did
not
are
you
still
weak
he
asked
tenderly
looking
close
into
niy
eyes
oh
it
is
not
that
reb
sender
is
it
the
death
of
your
dear
mother
peace
upon
her
yes
of
course
that
and
lots
of
other
things
it
will
all
pass
she
will
have
a
bright
paradise
and
the
upper
one
will
help
you
do
lose
heart
my
boy
i
ran
over
to
naphtali
place
we
talked
of
shiphrah
and
her
children
at
least
i
did
he
asked
about
matilda
and
i
answered
reluctantly
now
and
again
i
felt
impelled
to
tell
him
all
it
would
have
been
such
a
relief
to
ease
my
mind
of
its
cruel
burden
and
to
hear
somebody
anybody
opinion
about
it
but
his
laconical
questions
and
answers
were
anything
but
encouraging
i
spent
many
an
hour
in
his
company
but
he
was
always
absorbed
in
the
talmud
or
in
some
of
his
infidel
books
the
specific
character
of
my
restlessness
was
lost
upon
him
i
was
in
the
grip
of
a
dull
enervating
overpowering
agony
that
seemed
to
be
weighing
my
heart
down
and
filling
my
throat
with
sobs
i
was
writhing
inwardly
praying
for
mercy
it
was
the
most
excruciating
pain
i
had
ever
experienced
i
remember
it
distinctly
in
every
detail
if
i
now
wished
to
imagine
a
state
of
mind
driving
one
to
suicide
i
could
not
do
it
better
than
by
recalling
my
mental
condition
in
those
days
in
point
of
fact
i
took
pride
in
my
misery
i
am
in
love
i
am
no
mere
slouch
of
a
talmud
student
i
would
say
to
myself
in
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
as
i
was
making
a
pretense
at
reading
talmud
a
poor
boy
came
in
to
call
me
out
in
the
alley
outside
the
house
of
worship
i
found
matilda
she
had
the
money
with
her
i
do
think
i
want
it
now
i
said
i
do
care
to
go
to
america
why
she
asked
impatiently
oh
take
it
and
let
me
be
done
with
it
she
said
forcing
a
small
packet
into
my
hand
i
have
no
time
to
bother
with
you
go
to
america
i
wish
you
good
luck
but
i
miss
you
i
be
able
to
live
without
you
what
are
you
crazy
she
said
sternly
you
forget
your
place
young
man
she
stalked
hastily
away
her
form
at
once
an
angel
of
light
and
a
messenger
of
death
being
swallowed
up
by
the
gloom
ten
minutes
later
when
i
was
at
my
book
again
my
heart
bleeding
and
my
head
in
a
daze
i
was
called
out
once
more
again
i
found
her
standing
in
the
lane
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
she
said
i
wish
you
good
luck
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
she
uttered
it
with
a
warm
cordiality
and
yet
the
note
of
impatience
which
rang
in
her
voice
ten
minutes
before
was
again
there
try
to
become
an
educated
man
in
america
she
added
the
main
thing
you
have
my
best
wishes
and
before
i
had
time
to
say
anything
she
shook
my
hand
and
was
gone
chapter
v
a
little
over
three
weeks
had
elapsed
it
was
two
days
after
passover
i
had
just
solemnized
the
first
anniversary
of
my
mother
death
the
snow
had
melted
each
of
my
five
senses
seemed
to
be
thrillingly
aware
of
the
presence
of
spring
i
was
at
the
railway
station
clustered
about
me
were
reb
sender
and
his
wife
two
other
talmudists
from
the
synagogue
the
retired
old
soldier
with
the
formidable
and
naphtali
as
i
write
these
words
i
seem
to
see
the
group
before
me
it
is
one
of
those
scenes
that
never
grow
dim
in
one
memory
be
a
good
jew
and
a
good
man
reb
sender
murmured
to
me
confusedly
do
not
forget
that
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
in
america
as
well
as
here
do
not
forget
to
write
us
naphtali
speaking
in
his
hoarse
whisper
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
made
me
repeat
my
promise
to
send
him
a
ship
ticket
from
america
i
promised
everything
that
was
asked
of
me
my
head
was
swimming
while
the
first
bell
was
sounding
for
the
passengers
to
board
the
train
shiphrah
rushed
in
puffing
for
breath
i
looked
at
the
door
to
see
if
matilda
was
not
following
her
she
was
not
the
group
around
me
made
way
for
the
rich
woman
here
she
said
handing
me
a
bill
and
a
package
there
is
a
boiled
chicken
in
it
and
some
other
things
provided
you
wo
neglect
your
talmud
in
america
a
minute
later
she
drew
her
purse
from
her
skirt
pocket
produced
a
bill
and
put
it
into
my
hand
that
all
the
other
money
i
had
for
my
journey
had
come
from
her
daughter
she
had
not
the
remotest
idea
i
made
my
final
farewells
amid
a
hubbub
of
excited
voices
and
eyes
glistening
with
tears
book
v

discover
america
chapter
i
two
weeks
later
i
was
one
of
a
multitude
of
steerage
passengers
on
a
bremen
steamship
on
my
way
to
new
york
who
can
depict
the
feeling
of
desolation
homesickness
uncertainty
and
anxiety
with
which
an
emigrant
makes
his
first
voyage
across
the
ocean
i
proved
to
be
a
good
sailor
but
the
sea
frightened
me
the
thumping
of
the
engines
was
drumming
a
ghastly
accompaniment
to
the
awesome
whisper
of
the
waves
i
felt
in
the
embrace
of
a
vast
uncanny
force
and
echoing
through
it
all
were
the
words
are
you
crazy
you
forget
your
place
young
man
when
columbus
was
crossing
the
atlantic
on
his
first
great
voyage
his
men
doubted
whether
they
would
ever
reach
land
so
does
many
an
emigrant
to
this
day
such
at
least
was
the
feeling
that
was
lurking
in
my
heart
while
the
bremen
steamer
was
carrying
me
to
new
york
day
after
day
passes
and
all
you
see
about
you
is
an
unbroken
waste
of
water
an
unrelieved
a
hopeless
monotony
of
water
you
know
that
a
change
will
come
but
this
knowledge
is
confined
to
your
brain
your
senses
are
skeptical
in
my
devotions
which
i
performed
three
times
a
day
without
counting
a
benediction
before
every
meal
and
every
drink
of
water
grace
after
every
meal
and
a
prayer
before
going
to
sleep
i
would
mentally
plead
for
the
safety
of
the
ship
and
for
a
speedy
sight
of
land
my
scanty
luggage
included
a
pair
of
phylacteries
and
a
plump
little
with
the
book
of
psalms
at
the
end
the
prayers
i
knew
by
heart
but
i
now
often
said
psalms
in
addition
particularly
when
the
sea
looked
angry
and
the
pitching
or
rolling
was
unusually
violent
i
would
read
all
kinds
of
psalms
but
my
favorite
among
them
was
the
generally
referred
to
by
our
people
as
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
its
opening
words
in
the
original
hebrew
it
is
a
poem
on
the
power
and
wisdom
of
god
as
manifested
in
the
wonders
of
nature
some
of
its
verses
dealing
with
the
sea
it
is
said
by
the
faithful
every
saturday
afternoon
during
the
fall
and
winter
so
i
could
have
recited
it
from
memory
but
i
preferred
to
read
it
in
my
for
it
seemed
as
though
the
familiar
words
had
changed
their
identity
and
meaning
especially
those
concerned
with
the
sea
their
divine
inspiration
was
now
something
visible
and
audible
it
was
not
i
who
was
reading
them
it
was
as
though
the
waves
and
the
clouds
the
whole
scene
of
restlessness
and
mystery
were
whispering
to
me
thou
who
coverest
thyself
with
light
as
with
a
garment
who
stretchest
out
the
heavens
like
a
curtain
who
layeth
the
beams
of
his
chambers
in
the
waters
who
maketh
the
clouds
his
chariot
who
walketh
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind
so
is
this
great
and
wide
sea
wherein
are
things
creeping
innumerable
both
small
and
great
beasts
there
go
the
ships
there
is
that
leviathan
whom
thou
hast
made
to
play
therein
the
relentless
presence
of
matilda
in
my
mind
worried
me
immeasurably
for
to
think
of
a
woman
who
is
a
stranger
to
you
is
a
sin
and
so
there
was
the
danger
of
the
vessel
coming
to
grief
on
my
account
and
as
though
to
spite
me
the
closing
verse
of
psalm
reads
let
the
sinners
be
consumed
out
of
the
earth
and
let
the
wicked
be
no
more
i
strained
every
nerve
to
keep
matilda
out
of
my
thoughts
but
without
avail
when
the
discoverers
of
america
saw
land
at
last
they
fell
on
their
knees
and
a
hymn
of
thanksgiving
burst
from
their
souls
the
scene
which
is
one
of
the
most
thrilling
in
history
repeats
itself
in
the
heart
of
every
immigrant
as
he
comes
in
sight
of
the
american
shores
i
am
at
a
loss
to
convey
the
peculiar
state
of
mind
that
the
experience
created
in
me
when
the
ship
reached
sandy
hook
i
was
literally
overcome
with
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
the
immigrant
arrival
in
his
new
home
is
like
a
second
birth
to
him
imagine
a
babe
in
possession
of
a
fully
developed
intellect
would
it
ever
forget
its
entry
into
the
world
neither
does
the
immigrant
ever
forget
his
entry
into
a
country
which
is
to
him
a
new
world
in
the
profoundest
sense
of
the
term
and
in
which
he
expects
to
pass
the
rest
of
his
life
i
conjure
up
the
gorgeousness
of
the
spectacle
as
it
appeared
to
me
on
that
clear
june
morning
the
magnificent
verdure
of
staten
island
the
tender
blue
of
sea
and
sky
the
dignified
bustle
of
passing
craft
above
all
those
floating
squatting
multitudinously
windowed
palaces
which
i
subsequently
learned
to
call
ferries
it
was
all
so
utterly
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
seen
or
dreamed
of
before
it
unfolded
itself
like
a
divine
revelation
i
was
in
a
trance
or
in
something
closely
resembling
one
this
then
is
america
i
exclaimed
mutely
the
notion
of
something
enchanted
which
the
name
had
always
evoked
in
me
now
seemed
fully
borne
out
in
my
ecstasy
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
psalm
and
opening
my
little
i
glanced
over
those
of
its
verses
that
speak
of
hills
and
rocks
of
grass
and
trees
and
birds
my
transport
of
admiration
however
only
added
to
my
sense
of
helplessness
and
awe
here
on
shipboard
i
was
sure
of
my
shelter
and
food
at
least
how
was
i
going
to
procure
my
sustenance
on
those
magic
shores
i
wished
the
remaining
hour
could
be
prolonged
indefinitely
psalm
spoke
reassuringly
to
me
it
reminded
me
of
the
way
god
took
care
of
man
and
beast
thou
openest
thine
hand
and
they
are
filled
with
good
but
then
the
very
next
verse
warned
me
that
thou
hidest
thy
face
they
are
troubled
thou
takest
away
their
breath
they
die
so
i
was
praying
god
not
to
hide
his
face
from
me
but
to
open
his
hand
to
me
to
remember
that
my
mother
had
been
murdered
by
gentiles
and
that
i
was
going
to
a
strange
land
when
i
reached
the
words
i
will
sing
unto
the
lord
as
long
as
i
live
i
will
sing
praise
to
my
god
while
i
have
my
being
i
uttered
them
in
a
fervent
whisper
my
unhappy
love
never
ceased
to
harrow
me
the
stern
image
of
matilda
blended
with
the
hostile
glamour
of
america
one
of
my
was
a
young
tailor
named
gitelson
he
was
about
years
old
yet
his
forelock
was
gray
just
his
forelock
the
rest
of
his
hair
being
a
fine
glossy
brown
his
own
cap
had
been
blown
into
the
sea
and
the
one
he
had
obtained
from
the
steerage
steward
was
too
small
for
him
so
that
gray
tuft
of
his
was
always
out
like
a
plume
we
had
not
been
acquainted
more
than
a
few
hours
in
fact
for
he
had
been
seasick
throughout
the
voyage
and
this
was
the
first
day
he
had
been
up
and
about
but
then
i
had
seen
him
on
the
day
of
our
sailing
and
subsequently
many
times
as
he
wretchedly
lay
in
his
berth
he
was
literally
in
tatters
he
clung
to
me
like
a
lover
but
we
spoke
very
little
our
hearts
were
too
full
for
words
as
i
thus
stood
at
the
railing
in
hand
he
took
a
look
at
the
page
the
most
ignorant
man
of
the
earth
among
our
people
can
read
holy
tongue
hebrew
though
he
may
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
this
was
the
case
with
gitelson
saying
the
lord
o
my
soul
he
asked
reverently
why
this
chapter
of
all
others
because
why
just
listen
with
which
i
took
to
translating
the
hebrew
text
into
yiddish
for
him
he
listened
with
devout
mien
i
was
not
sure
that
he
understood
it
even
in
his
native
tongue
but
whether
he
did
or
not
his
beaming
wistful
look
and
the
deep
sigh
he
emitted
indicated
that
he
was
in
a
state
similar
to
mine
when
i
say
that
my
first
view
of
new
york
bay
struck
me
as
something
not
of
this
earth
it
is
not
a
mere
figure
of
speech
i
vividly
recall
the
feeling
for
example
with
which
i
greeted
the
first
cat
i
saw
on
american
soil
it
was
on
the
hoboken
pier
while
the
steerage
passengers
were
being
marched
to
the
ferry
a
large
black
feline
stood
in
a
corner
eying
the
crowd
of
the
sight
of
it
gave
me
a
thrill
of
joy
look
there
is
a
cat
i
said
to
gitelson
and
in
my
heart
i
added
just
like
those
at
home
for
the
moment
the
little
animal
made
america
real
to
me
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
unreal
itself
i
was
tempted
to
feel
its
fur
to
ascertain
whether
it
was
actually
the
kind
of
creature
i
took
it
for
we
were
ferried
over
to
castle
garden
one
of
the
things
that
caught
my
eye
as
i
entered
the
vast
rotunda
was
an
iron
staircase
rising
diagonally
against
one
of
the
inner
walls
a
uniformed
man
with
some
papers
in
his
hands
ascended
it
with
brisk
resounding
step
till
he
disappeared
through
a
door
not
many
inches
from
the
ceiling
it
may
seem
odd
but
i
can
never
think
of
my
arrival
in
this
country
without
hearing
the
ringing
footfalls
of
this
official
and
beholding
the
yellow
eyes
of
the
black
cat
which
stared
at
us
at
the
hoboken
pier
the
harsh
manner
of
the
immigration
officers
was
a
grievous
surprise
to
me
as
contrasted
with
the
officials
of
my
despotic
country
those
of
a
republic
had
been
portrayed
in
my
mind
as
paragons
of
refinement
and
cordiality
my
anticipations
were
rudely
belied
they
are
not
a
bit
better
than
cossacks
i
remarked
to
gitelson
but
they
neither
looked
nor
spoke
like
cossacks
so
their
gruff
voices
were
part
of
the
uncanny
scheme
of
things
that
surrounded
me
these
unfriendly
voices
flavored
all
america
with
a
spirit
of
icy
inhospitality
that
sent
a
chill
through
my
very
soul
the
stringent
immigration
laws
that
were
passed
some
years
later
had
not
yet
come
into
existence
we
had
no
difficulty
in
being
admitted
to
the
united
states
and
when
i
was
i
was
loath
to
leave
the
garden
many
of
the
other
immigrants
were
met
by
relatives
friends
there
were
cries
of
joy
tears
embraces
kisses
all
of
which
intensified
my
sense
of
loneliness
and
dread
of
the
new
world
the
agencies
which
two
jewish
charity
organizations
now
maintain
at
the
immigrant
station
had
not
yet
been
established
gitelson
who
like
myself
had
no
friends
in
new
york
never
left
my
side
he
was
even
more
timid
than
i
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
holding
on
to
me
for
dear
life
this
had
the
effect
of
putting
me
on
my
mettle
cheer
up
old
man
i
said
with
bravado
america
is
not
the
place
to
be
a
ninny
in
come
pull
yourself
together
in
truth
i
addressed
these
exhortations
as
much
to
myself
as
to
him
and
so
far
at
least
as
i
was
concerned
my
words
had
the
desired
effect
i
led
the
way
out
of
the
big
immigrant
station
as
we
reached
the
park
outside
we
were
pounced
down
upon
by
two
men
representatives
of
for
immigrants
they
pulled
us
so
roughly
and
their
general
appearance
and
manner
were
so
uninviting
that
we
struggled
and
protested
until
they
let
us
go
not
without
some
parting
curses
then
i
led
the
way
across
battery
park
and
under
the
elevated
railway
to
state
street
a
train
hurtling
and
panting
along
overhead
produced
a
bewildering
a
daunting
effect
on
me
the
active
life
of
the
great
strange
city
made
me
feel
like
one
abandoned
in
the
midst
of
a
jungle
where
were
we
to
go
what
were
we
to
do
but
the
presence
of
gitelson
continued
to
act
as
a
spur
on
me
i
mustered
courage
to
approach
a
policeman
something
i
should
never
have
been
bold
enough
to
do
at
home
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
scarcely
had
an
idea
what
his
function
was
to
me
he
looked
like
some
uniformed
nobleman
an
impression
that
in
itself
was
enough
to
intimidate
me
with
his
coat
of
blue
cloth
starched
linen
collar
and
white
gloves
he
reminded
me
of
anything
but
the
policemen
of
my
town
i
addressed
him
in
yiddish
making
it
as
near
an
approach
to
german
as
i
knew
how
but
my
efforts
were
lost
on
him
he
shook
his
head
with
a
witheringly
dignified
grimace
he
then
pointed
his
club
in
the
direction
of
broadway
and
strutted
off
majestically
he
not
better
than
a
cossack
either
was
my
verdict
at
this
moment
a
voice
hailed
us
in
yiddish
facing
about
we
beheld
a
man
with
huge
round
perpendicular
nostrils
and
a
huge
round
deep
dimple
in
his
chin
that
looked
like
a
third
nostril
prosperity
was
written
all
over
his
face
and
stocky
figure
he
was
literally
aglow
with
diamonds
and
but
he
was
unmistakably
one
of
our
people
it
was
like
coming
across
a
human
being
in
the
jungle
moreover
his
very
diamonds
somehow
told
a
tale
of
former
want
of
a
time
when
he
had
landed
an
impecunious
immigrant
like
myself
and
this
made
him
a
living
source
of
encouragement
to
me
god
himself
has
sent
you
to
us
i
began
acting
as
the
spokesman
but
he
gave
no
heed
to
me
his
eyes
were
eagerly
fixed
on
gitelson
and
his
tatters
you
a
tailor
are
you
he
questioned
him
my
steerage
companion
nodded
i
a
ladies
tailor
but
i
have
worked
on
men
clothing
too
he
said
a
ladies
tailor
the
stranger
echoed
with
delight
very
well
come
along
i
have
work
for
you
that
he
should
have
been
able
to
read
gitelson
trade
in
his
face
and
figure
scarcely
surprised
me
in
my
native
place
it
seemed
to
be
a
matter
of
course
that
one
could
tell
a
tailor
by
his
general
appearance
and
walk
besides
had
i
not
divined
the
occupation
of
my
the
moment
i
saw
him
on
deck
as
i
learned
subsequently
the
man
who
accosted
us
on
state
street
was
a
cloak
contractor
and
his
presence
in
the
neighborhood
of
castle
garden
was
anything
but
a
matter
of
chance
he
came
there
quite
often
in
fact
his
purpose
being
to
angle
for
cheap
labor
among
the
newly
arrived
immigrants
we
paused
near
bowling
green
the
contractor
and
my
were
absorbed
in
a
conversation
full
of
sartorial
technicalities
which
were
greek
to
me
but
which
brought
a
gleam
of
joy
into
gitelson
eye
my
former
companion
seemed
to
have
become
oblivious
of
my
existence
as
we
resumed
our
walk
up
broadway
the
bejeweled
man
turned
to
me
and
what
was
your
occupation
you
have
no
trade
have
you
i
read
talmud
i
said
confusedly
i
see
but
that
no
business
in
america
he
declared
any
relatives
here
well
do
worry
you
will
be
all
right
if
a
fellow
is
lazy
nor
a
fool
he
has
no
reason
to
be
sorry
he
came
to
america
it
be
all
right
all
right
he
said
in
english
and
i
conjectured
what
it
meant
from
the
context
in
the
course
of
the
minute
or
two
which
he
bestowed
upon
me
he
uttered
it
so
many
times
that
the
phrase
engraved
itself
upon
my
memory
it
was
the
first
bit
of
english
i
ever
acquired
the
crowds
of
lower
broadway
impressed
me
as
a
multitude
of
counts
barons
princes
i
was
puzzled
by
their
preoccupied
faces
and
hurried
step
it
seemed
to
comport
ill
with
their
baronial
dress
and
general
appearance
in
a
vague
way
all
this
helped
to
confirm
my
conception
of
america
as
a
unique
country
unlike
the
rest
of
the
world
when
we
reached
the
general
at
the
end
of
the
third
avenue
surface
line
our
guide
bade
us
stop
walk
straight
ahead
he
said
to
me
waving
his
hand
toward
park
row
just
keep
walking
until
you
see
a
lot
of
jewish
people
it
is
far
from
here
with
which
he
slipped
a
silver
quarter
into
my
hand
and
made
gitelson
bid
me
the
two
then
boarded
a
big
red
i
was
left
with
a
sickening
sense
of
having
been
tricked
cast
off
and
abandoned
i
stood
watching
the
receding
public
vehicle
as
though
its
scarlet
hue
were
my
last
gleam
of
hope
in
the
world
when
it
finally
disappeared
from
view
my
heart
sank
within
me
i
may
safely
say
that
the
that
followed
is
one
of
the
worst
i
experienced
in
all
the
years
of
my
life
in
this
country
the
big
round
nostrils
of
the
contractor
and
the
gray
forelock
of
my
young
haunted
my
brain
as
hideous
symbols
of
treachery
with
cents
in
my
pocket
four
cents
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
sum
which
i
had
received
from
matilda
and
her
mother
i
set
forth
in
the
direction
of
east
broadway
chapter
ii
ten
minutes
walk
brought
me
to
the
heart
of
the
jewish
east
side
the
streets
swarmed
with
immigrants
the
were
in
english
and
yiddish
some
of
them
in
russian
the
scurry
and
hustle
of
the
people
were
not
merely
overwhelmingly
greater
both
in
volume
and
intensity
than
in
my
native
town
it
was
of
another
sort
the
swing
and
step
of
the
pedestrians
the
voices
and
manner
of
the
street
peddlers
and
a
hundred
and
one
other
things
seemed
to
testify
to
far
more
and
energy
to
larger
ambitions
and
wider
scopes
than
did
the
appearance
of
the
crowds
in
my
birthplace
the
great
thing
was
that
these
people
were
better
dressed
than
the
inhabitants
of
my
town
the
man
wore
a
hat
instead
of
a
cap
a
stiff
collar
and
a
necktie
and
the
poorest
woman
wore
a
hat
or
a
bonnet
the
appearance
of
a
newly
arrived
immigrant
was
still
a
novel
spectacle
on
the
east
side
many
of
the
paused
to
look
at
me
with
wistful
smiles
of
curiosity
there
goes
a
green
one
some
of
them
exclaimed
the
sight
of
me
obviously
evoked
reminiscences
in
them
of
the
days
when
they
had
been
green
ones
like
myself
it
was
a
second
birth
that
they
were
witnessing
an
experience
which
they
had
once
gone
through
themselves
and
which
was
one
of
the
greatest
events
in
their
lives
green
one
or
greenhorn
is
one
of
the
many
english
words
and
phrases
which
my
has
appropriated
in
england
and
america
thanks
to
the
many
millions
of
letters
that
pass
annually
between
the
jews
of
russia
and
their
relatives
in
the
united
states
a
number
of
these
words
have
by
now
come
to
be
generally
known
among
our
people
at
home
as
well
as
here
in
the
eighties
however
one
who
had
not
visited
any
country
was
utterly
unfamiliar
with
them
and
so
i
had
never
heard
of
green
one
before
still
green
in
the
sense
of
color
is
yiddish
as
well
as
english
so
i
understood
the
phrase
at
once
and
as
a
contemptuous
quizzical
appellation
for
a
newly
arrived
inexperienced
immigrant
it
stung
me
cruelly
as
i
went
along
i
heard
it
again
and
again
some
of
the
would
call
me
greenhorn
in
a
tone
of
blighting
gaiety
but
these
were
an
exception
for
the
most
part
it
was
green
one
and
in
a
spirit
of
sympathetic
interest
it
hurt
me
all
the
same
even
those
glances
that
offered
me
a
cordial
welcome
and
good
wishes
had
something
and
condescending
in
them
poor
fellow
he
is
a
green
one
these
people
seemed
to
say
we
are
not
of
course
we
are
americanized
for
my
first
meal
in
the
new
world
i
bought
a
wedge
of
coarse
rye
bread
off
a
huge
round
loaf
on
a
stand
on
essex
street
i
was
too
strict
in
my
religious
observances
to
eat
it
without
first
performing
ablutions
and
offering
a
brief
prayer
so
i
approached
a
bewigged
old
woman
who
stood
in
the
doorway
of
a
small
to
let
me
wash
my
hands
and
eat
my
meal
in
her
place
she
looked
enough
yet
when
she
heard
my
request
she
said
with
a
laugh
you
a
green
one
i
see
suppose
i
am
i
resented
do
the
yellow
ones
or
black
ones
all
eat
without
washing
ca
a
fellow
be
a
good
jew
in
america
yes
of
course
he
can
but
well
wait
till
you
see
for
yourself
however
she
asked
me
to
come
in
gave
me
some
water
and
an
old
apron
to
serve
me
for
a
towel
and
when
i
was
ready
to
eat
my
bread
she
placed
a
glass
of
milk
before
me
explaining
that
she
was
not
going
to
charge
me
for
it
in
america
people
are
not
foolish
enough
to
be
content
with
dry
bread
she
said
sententiously
while
i
ate
she
questioned
me
about
my
antecedents
i
remember
how
she
impressed
me
as
a
strong
clever
woman
of
few
words
as
long
as
she
catechised
me
and
how
disappointed
i
was
when
she
began
to
talk
of
herself
the
astute
knowing
mien
gradually
faded
out
of
her
face
and
i
had
before
me
a
gushing
boastful
old
bore
my
intention
was
to
take
a
long
stroll
as
much
in
the
hope
of
coming
upon
some
windfall
as
for
the
purpose
of
taking
a
look
at
the
great
american
city
many
of
the
letters
that
came
from
the
united
states
to
my
birthplace
before
i
sailed
had
contained
a
warning
not
to
imagine
that
america
was
a
land
of
gold
and
that
treasure
might
be
had
in
the
streets
of
new
york
for
the
picking
but
these
warnings
only
had
the
effect
of
lending
vividness
to
my
image
of
an
american
street
as
a
thoroughfare
strewn
with
nuggets
of
the
precious
metal
symbolically
speaking
this
was
the
idea
one
had
of
the
land
of
columbus
it
was
a
continuation
of
the
widespread
effect
produced
by
stories
of
cortes
and
pizarro
in
the
sixteenth
century
confirmed
by
the
successes
of
some
russian
emigrants
of
my
time
i
asked
the
to
let
me
leave
my
bundle
with
her
and
after
considerable
hesitation
she
allowed
me
to
put
it
among
some
empty
barrels
in
her
cellar
i
went
wandering
over
the
ghetto
instead
of
stumbling
upon
nuggets
of
gold
i
found
signs
of
poverty
in
one
place
i
came
across
a
poor
family
who
as
i
learned
upon
inquiry
had
been
dispossessed
for
of
rent
a
mother
and
her
two
little
boys
were
watching
their
pile
of
furniture
and
other
household
goods
on
the
sidewalk
while
the
were
dropping
coins
into
a
saucer
placed
on
one
of
the
chairs
to
enable
the
family
to
move
into
new
quarters
what
puzzled
me
was
the
nature
of
the
furniture
for
in
my
birthplace
chairs
and
a
couch
like
those
i
now
saw
on
the
sidewalk
would
be
a
sign
of
prosperity
but
then
anything
was
to
be
expected
of
a
country
where
the
poorest
devil
wore
a
hat
and
a
starched
collar
i
walked
on
the
exclamation
a
green
one
or
a
greenhorn
continued
if
i
did
not
hear
it
i
saw
it
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
who
passed
me
when
it
grew
dark
and
i
was
much
in
need
of
rest
i
had
a
street
peddler
direct
me
to
a
synagogue
i
expected
to
spend
the
night
there
what
could
have
been
more
natural
at
the
house
of
god
i
found
a
handful
of
men
in
prayer
it
was
a
large
spacious
room
and
the
smallness
of
their
number
gave
it
an
air
of
desolation
i
joined
in
the
devotions
with
great
fervor
my
soul
was
sobbing
to
heaven
to
take
care
of
me
in
the
strange
country
the
service
over
several
of
the
worshipers
took
up
some
talmud
folio
or
other
holy
book
and
proceeded
to
read
them
aloud
in
the
familiar
singsong
the
strange
surroundings
suddenly
began
to
look
like
home
to
me
one
of
the
readers
an
elderly
man
with
a
pinched
face
and
forked
little
beard
paused
to
look
me
over
a
green
one
he
asked
genially
he
told
me
that
the
synagogue
was
crowded
on
saturdays
while
on
people
in
america
had
no
time
to
say
their
prayers
at
home
much
less
to
visit
a
house
of
worship
it
is
russia
he
said
with
a
sigh
judaism
has
not
much
of
a
chance
here
when
he
heard
that
i
intended
to
stay
at
the
synagogue
overnight
he
smiled
ruefully
one
does
not
sleep
in
an
american
synagogue
he
said
it
is
not
russia
then
scanning
me
once
more
he
added
with
an
air
of
compassionate
perplexity
where
will
you
sleep
poor
child
i
wish
i
could
take
you
to
my
house
but
well
america
is
not
russia
there
is
no
pity
here
no
hospitality
my
wife
would
raise
a
rumpus
if
i
brought
you
along
i
should
never
hear
the
last
of
it
with
a
deep
sigh
and
nodding
his
head
plaintively
he
returned
to
his
book
swaying
back
and
forth
but
he
was
apparently
more
interested
in
the
subject
he
had
broached
when
we
were
at
home
he
resumed
she
too
was
a
different
woman
she
did
not
make
life
a
burden
to
me
as
she
does
here
have
you
no
money
at
all
i
showed
him
the
quarter
i
had
received
from
the
cloak
contractor
poor
fellow
is
that
all
you
have
there
are
places
where
you
can
get
a
night
lodging
for
fifteen
cents
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
afterward
i
am
simply
ashamed
of
myself
he
quoted
from
the
talmud
one
of
the
things
which
the
giver
enjoys
in
this
world
and
the
fruit
of
which
he
relishes
in
the
world
to
come
to
think
that
i
can
not
offer
a
talmudic
scholar
a
night
rest
alas
america
has
turned
me
into
a
mound
of
ashes
you
were
well
off
in
russia
were
you
i
inquired
in
astonishment
for
indeed
i
had
never
heard
of
any
but
poor
people
emigrating
to
america
i
used
to
spend
my
time
reading
talmud
at
the
synagogue
was
his
reply
many
of
his
answers
seemed
to
fit
not
the
question
asked
but
one
which
was
expected
to
follow
it
you
might
have
thought
him
anxious
to
forestall
your
next
query
in
order
to
save
time
and
words
had
it
not
been
so
difficult
for
him
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
she
he
said
referring
to
his
wife
had
a
nice
little
business
she
sold
feed
for
horses
and
she
rejoiced
in
the
thought
that
she
was
married
to
a
man
of
learning
true
she
has
a
tongue
that
she
always
had
but
over
there
it
was
not
so
bad
she
has
become
a
different
woman
here
alas
america
is
a
country
he
went
on
to
show
how
the
new
world
turned
things
upside
down
transforming
an
immigrant
shoemaker
into
a
man
of
substance
while
a
former
man
of
leisure
was
forced
to
work
in
a
factory
here
in
like
manner
his
wife
had
changed
for
the
worse
for
lo
and
behold
instead
of
supporting
him
while
he
read
talmud
as
she
used
to
do
at
home
she
persisted
in
sending
him
out
to
peddle
america
is
not
russia
she
said
a
man
must
make
a
living
here
but
alas
it
was
too
late
to
begin
now
he
had
spent
the
better
part
of
his
life
at
his
holy
books
and
was
fit
for
nothing
else
now
his
wife
however
would
take
no
excuse
he
must
peddle
or
be
nagged
to
death
and
if
he
ventured
to
slip
into
some
synagogue
of
an
afternoon
and
read
a
page
or
two
he
would
be
in
danger
of
being
caught
so
to
say
for
indeed
she
often
shadowed
him
to
make
sure
that
he
did
not
play
truant
alas
america
was
not
russia
a
thought
crossed
my
mind
that
if
reb
sender
were
here
he
too
might
have
to
go
peddling
poor
reb
sender
the
very
image
of
him
with
a
basket
on
his
arm
broke
my
heart
america
did
seem
to
be
the
most
cruel
place
on
earth
i
am
telling
you
all
this
that
you
may
see
why
i
ca
invite
you
to
my
house
explained
the
peddier
all
i
did
see
was
that
the
poor
man
could
not
help
unburdening
his
mind
to
the
first
listener
that
presented
himself
he
pursued
his
tale
of
woe
he
went
on
complaining
of
his
own
fate
quite
forgetful
of
mine
instead
of
continuing
to
listen
i
fell
to
gazing
around
the
synagogue
more
or
less
furtively
one
of
the
readers
attracted
my
special
attention
he
was
a
man
with
a
face
which
as
i
now
recall
it
reminds
me
of
thackeray
only
he
had
a
finer
head
than
the
english
novelist
at
last
the
henpecked
man
discovered
my
inattention
and
fell
silent
a
minute
later
his
tongue
was
at
work
again
you
are
looking
at
that
man
over
there
are
you
he
asked
who
is
he
when
the
lord
of
the
world
gives
one
good
luck
he
gives
one
good
looks
as
well
why
is
he
rich
his
is
but
then
his
daughter
cherishes
him
as
she
does
the
apple
of
her
eye
and
well
when
the
lord
of
the
world
wishes
to
give
a
man
happiness
he
gives
him
good
children
you
know
he
rattled
on
betraying
his
envy
of
the
man
in
various
ways
and
telling
me
all
he
knew
about
him
that
he
was
a
widower
named
even
that
he
had
been
some
years
in
america
and
that
his
daughter
furnished
him
all
the
money
he
needed
and
a
good
deal
more
so
that
he
lived
like
a
monarch
even
would
not
live
in
his
daughter
house
however
because
her
kitchen
was
not
conducted
according
to
the
laws
of
moses
and
everything
else
in
it
was
too
modern
so
he
roomed
and
boarded
with
pious
strangers
visiting
her
far
less
frequently
than
she
visited
him
and
never
eating
at
her
table
he
is
a
very
proud
man
my
informant
said
one
must
not
approach
him
otherwise
than
on
tiptoe
i
threw
a
glance
at
even
his
dignified
singsong
seemed
to
confirm
my
interlocutor
characterization
of
him
perhaps
you
will
ask
me
how
his
takes
it
all
the
voluble
talmudist
went
on
well
his
daughter
is
a
beautiful
woman
and
well
favored
the
implication
was
that
her
husband
was
extremely
fond
of
her
and
let
her
use
his
money
freely
they
are
awfully
rich
and
they
live
like
veritable
gentiles
which
is
a
common
disease
among
the
jews
of
america
but
then
she
observes
the
commandment
thy
father
that
she
does
again
he
tried
to
read
his
book
and
again
the
temptation
to
gossip
was
too
much
for
him
he
returned
to
even
pride
dwelling
with
considerable
venom
upon
his
love
of
approbation
and
vanity
may
the
uppermost
not
punish
me
for
my
evil
words
but
to
see
him
take
his
roll
of
bills
out
of
his
pocket
and
pay
his
contribution
to
the
synagogue
one
would
think
he
was
some
big
merchant
and
not
a
poor
devil
sponging
on
his
a
few
minutes
later
he
told
me
admiringly
how
even
often
loaned
him
a
to
enable
him
to
do
some
reading
at
the
house
of
god
i
tell
my
virago
of
a
wife
i
have
sold
fifty
cents
worth
of
goods
he
explained
to
me
sadly
after
a
while
the
man
with
the
thackeray
face
closed
his
book
kissed
it
and
rose
to
go
on
his
way
out
he
unceremoniously
paused
in
front
of
me
a
silver
in
his
left
hand
and
fell
to
scrutinizing
me
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
rabbi
of
a
large
prosperous
town
he
is
going
to
say
green
one
i
prophesied
to
myself
all
but
shuddering
at
the
prospect
and
sure
enough
he
did
but
he
took
his
time
about
it
which
made
the
next
minute
seem
a
year
to
me
he
took
snuff
with
tantalizing
deliberation
next
he
sneezed
with
great
zest
and
then
he
resumed
sizing
me
up
the
suspense
was
insupportable
another
second
and
i
might
have
burst
out
for
mercy
sake
say
green
one
and
let
us
be
done
with
it
but
at
that
moment
he
uttered
it
of
his
own
accord
a
green
one
i
see
where
from
and
grasping
my
hand
he
added
in
hebrew
peace
be
to
ye
his
first
questions
about
me
were
obsequiously
answered
by
the
man
with
the
forked
beard
whereupon
my
attention
was
attracted
by
the
fact
that
he
addressed
him
by
his
gentile
name
that
is
as
mr
even
and
not
by
his
hebrew
name
as
he
would
have
done
in
our
birthplace
surely
america
did
not
seem
to
be
much
of
a
country
when
mr
even
heard
of
my
talmud
studies
he
questioned
me
about
the
tractates
i
had
recently
read
and
even
challenged
me
to
explain
an
apparent
discrepancy
in
a
certain
passage
for
the
double
purpose
of
testing
my
talmud
brains
and
flaunting
his
own
i
acquitted
myself
creditably
it
seemed
and
i
felt
that
i
was
making
a
good
impression
personally
as
well
anyhow
he
invited
me
to
supper
in
a
restaurant
on
our
way
there
i
told
him
of
my
mother
violent
death
vaguely
hoping
that
it
would
add
to
his
interest
in
me
it
did
even
more
than
i
had
expected
to
my
pleasant
surprise
he
proved
to
be
familiar
with
the
incident
it
appeared
that
because
our
section
lay
far
outside
the
region
of
pogroms
or
riots
the
killing
of
my
mother
by
a
gentile
mob
had
attracted
considerable
attention
i
was
thrilled
to
find
myself
in
the
of
publicity
i
almost
felt
like
a
hero
so
you
are
her
son
he
said
pausing
to
look
me
over
as
though
i
had
suddenly
become
a
new
man
my
poor
orphan
boy
he
caused
me
to
recount
the
incident
in
every
detail
in
doing
so
i
made
it
as
appallingly
vivid
as
i
knew
how
he
was
so
absorbed
and
moved
that
he
repeatedly
made
me
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
sidewalk
so
as
to
look
me
in
the
face
as
he
listened
oh
but
you
must
be
hungry
he
suddenly
interrupted
me
come
on
arrived
at
the
restaurant
he
ordered
supper
for
me
then
he
withdrew
commending
me
to
the
care
of
the
proprietress
until
he
should
return
he
had
no
sooner
shut
the
door
behind
him
than
she
took
to
questioning
me
was
i
a
relative
of
mr
even
if
not
then
why
was
he
taking
so
much
interest
in
me
she
was
a
vivacious
young
matron
with
cheeks
of
a
flaming
red
and
with
the
consciousness
of
business
success
all
but
spurting
from
her
black
eyes
from
what
she
assisted
by
one
of
the
other
customers
present
told
me
about
my
benefactor
i
learned
that
his
was
the
owner
of
the
in
which
the
restaurant
was
located
as
well
as
of
several
other
buildings
they
also
told
me
of
the
landlord
wife
of
her
devotion
to
her
father
and
of
the
piety
and
dignity
it
appeared
however
that
in
her
filial
reverence
she
would
draw
the
line
upon
his
desire
not
to
spare
the
rod
upon
her
children
which
was
really
the
chief
reason
why
he
was
a
stranger
at
her
house
i
had
been
waiting
about
two
hours
and
was
growing
uneasy
when
mr
even
came
back
explaining
that
he
had
spent
the
time
taking
his
own
supper
and
finding
lodgings
for
me
he
then
took
me
to
store
after
store
buying
me
a
suit
of
clothes
a
hat
some
underclothes
handkerchiefs
the
first
white
handkerchiefs
i
ever
possessed
collars
shoes
and
a
necktie
he
spent
a
considerable
sum
on
me
as
we
passed
from
block
to
block
he
kept
saying
now
you
wo
look
green
or
that
will
make
you
look
american
at
one
point
he
added
not
that
you
are
a
fellow
as
it
is
but
then
one
must
be
presentable
in
america
at
this
he
quoted
from
the
talmud
an
equivalent
to
the
saying
that
one
must
do
in
rome
as
the
romans
do
when
all
our
purchases
had
been
made
he
took
me
to
a
barber
shop
with
bathrooms
in
the
rear
give
him
a
and
a
bath
he
said
to
the
proprietor
cut
off
his
while
you
are
at
it
one
may
go
without
them
and
yet
be
a
good
jew
he
disappeared
again
but
when
i
emerged
from
the
bathroom
i
found
him
waiting
for
me
i
stood
before
him
necktie
and
collar
in
hand
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
them
till
he
showed
me
how
to
put
them
on
do
worry
david
he
consoled
me
when
i
came
here
i
too
had
to
learn
these
things
when
he
was
through
with
the
job
he
took
me
in
front
of
a
quite
an
american
is
he
he
said
to
the
barber
beamingly
and
a
fellow
too
when
i
took
a
look
at
the
mirror
i
was
bewildered
i
scarcely
recognized
myself
i
was
mentally
parading
my
modern
before
matilda
a
pang
of
yearning
clutched
my
heart
it
was
a
momentary
feeling
for
the
rest
i
was
all
in
a
flutter
with
embarrassment
and
a
novel
relish
of
existence
it
was
as
though
the
and
the
american
clothes
had
changed
my
identity
the
steamer
gitelson
and
the
man
who
had
snatched
him
up
now
appeared
to
be
something
of
the
remote
past
the
day
had
been
so
crowded
with
novel
impressions
that
it
seemed
an
age
he
took
me
to
an
apartment
in
a
poor
and
introduced
me
to
a
tall
bewhiskered
elderly
man
and
a
smiling
woman
of
explaining
that
he
had
paid
them
in
advance
for
a
month
board
and
lodging
when
he
said
this
is
levinsky
i
felt
as
though
i
was
being
promoted
in
rank
as
behooved
my
new
appearance
mister
struck
me
as
something
like
a
title
of
nobility
it
thrilled
me
but
somehow
it
seemed
ridiculous
too
indeed
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
think
of
myself
as
a
mister
without
being
tempted
to
laugh
and
here
is
some
cash
for
you
he
said
handing
me
a
bill
and
some
silver
in
addition
and
now
you
must
shift
for
yourself
that
all
i
can
do
for
you
nor
indeed
would
i
do
more
if
i
could
a
young
man
like
you
must
learn
to
stand
on
his
own
legs
understand
if
you
do
well
come
to
see
me
understand
there
was
an
eloquent
pause
which
said
that
if
i
did
not
do
well
i
was
not
to
molest
him
then
he
added
aloud
there
is
only
one
thing
i
want
you
to
promise
me
do
neglect
your
religion
nor
your
talmud
do
you
promise
that
david
i
did
there
was
a
note
of
fatherly
tenderness
in
the
way
this
utter
stranger
called
me
david
it
reminded
me
of
reb
sender
i
wanted
to
say
something
to
express
my
gratitude
but
i
felt
a
lump
in
my
throat
he
advised
me
to
invest
the
five
dollars
in
and
to
take
up
peddling
then
wishing
me
good
luck
he
left
my
landlady
who
had
listened
to
mr
even
parting
words
with
pious
nods
and
rapturous
grins
remarked
that
one
would
vainly
search
the
world
for
another
man
like
him
and
proceeded
to
make
my
bed
on
a
lounge
the
room
was
a
kitchen
the
stove
was
a
puzzle
to
me
i
wondered
whether
it
was
really
a
stove
is
this
used
for
heating
i
inquired
yes
for
heating
and
cooking
she
explained
with
smiling
cordiality
and
she
added
with
infinite
superiority
america
has
no
use
for
those
big
tile
ovens
when
i
found
myself
alone
in
the
room
the
feeling
of
desolation
and
uncertainty
which
had
tormented
me
all
day
seized
me
once
again
i
went
to
bed
and
began
to
say
my
i
did
so
mechanically
my
mind
did
not
attend
to
the
words
i
was
murmuring
instead
it
was
saying
to
god
lord
of
the
universe
you
have
been
good
to
me
so
far
i
went
out
of
that
in
the
hope
of
coming
upon
some
good
piece
of
luck
and
my
hope
was
realized
be
good
to
me
in
the
future
as
well
i
shall
be
more
pious
than
ever
i
promise
you
even
if
america
is
a
godless
country
i
was
excruciatingly
homesick
my
heart
went
out
to
my
poor
dead
mother
then
i
reflected
that
it
was
my
story
of
her
death
that
had
led
even
to
spend
so
much
money
on
me
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
taking
care
of
me
from
her
grave
it
seemed
too
as
though
she
had
died
so
that
i
might
arouse
sympathy
and
make
a
good
start
in
america
i
thought
of
her
and
of
all
antomir
and
my
pangs
of
yearning
for
her
were
tinged
with
pangs
of
my
unrequited
love
for
matilda
chapter
iii
my
landlady
was
a
robust
little
woman
compact
and
mobile
as
a
continually
bustling
about
chattering
and
smiling
or
laughing
she
was
a
silly
creature
and
her
smile
which
automatically
shut
her
eyes
and
opened
her
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
accentuated
her
kindliness
as
well
as
her
lack
of
sense
when
she
did
not
talk
she
would
hum
or
sing
at
the
top
of
her
absurd
voice
the
then
popular
american
song
climbing
up
the
golden
stairs
she
told
me
the
very
next
day
that
she
had
been
married
less
than
a
year
and
one
of
the
first
things
i
noticed
about
her
was
the
pleasure
it
gave
her
to
refer
to
her
husband
or
to
quote
him
her
prattle
was
so
full
of
my
husband
says
says
my
husband
that
it
seemed
as
though
the
chief
purpose
of
her
jabber
was
to
parade
her
married
state
and
to
hear
herself
talk
of
her
spouse
the
words
my
husband
were
music
to
her
ears
they
actually
meant
behold
i
am
an
old
maid
no
longer
she
was
so
deeply
impressed
by
the
story
of
my
meeting
with
mr
even
whose
was
her
landlord
and
by
the
amount
he
had
spent
on
me
that
she
retailed
it
among
her
neighbors
some
of
whom
she
invited
to
the
house
in
order
to
exhibit
me
to
them
her
name
was
dienstog
which
is
yiddish
for
tuesday
now
tuesday
is
a
lucky
day
so
i
saw
a
good
omen
in
her
and
thanked
god
her
name
was
not
monday
or
wednesday
which
according
to
the
talmud
are
unlucky
one
of
the
first
things
i
did
was
to
make
up
a
list
of
the
english
words
and
phrases
which
our
people
in
this
country
had
adopted
as
part
and
parcel
of
their
native
tongue
this
i
felt
was
an
essential
step
toward
shedding
one
greenhornhood
an
operation
every
immigrant
is
anxious
to
dispose
of
without
delay
the
list
included
floor
ceiling
window
dinner
supper
hat
business
job
clean
plenty
never
ready
anyhow
never
mind
hurry
up
all
right
and
about
a
hundred
other
words
and
phrases
i
was
quick
to
realize
that
to
be
stylishly
dressed
was
a
good
investment
but
i
realized
too
that
to
use
the
yiddish
word
for
collar
or
clean
instead
of
their
english
correlatives
was
worse
than
to
wear
a
dirty
collar
i
wrote
down
the
english
words
in
hebrew
characters
and
from
my
landlady
dictation
so
that
never
mind
for
example
became
nevermine
when
i
came
home
with
a
basket
containing
my
first
stock
of
wares
dienstog
ran
into
ecstasies
over
it
she
took
to
fingering
some
of
my
and
garters
and
when
i
protested
she
drew
away
pouting
still
the
next
morning
as
i
was
leaving
the
house
with
my
stock
she
wished
me
good
luck
ardently
and
when
i
left
the
house
she
ran
after
me
shouting
wait
levinsky
i
buy
something
of
you
a
lucky
start
she
picked
out
a
paper
of
pins
and
as
she
paid
me
the
price
she
said
devoutly
may
this
little
basket
become
one
of
the
biggest
stores
in
new
york
my
plan
of
campaign
was
to
peddle
in
the
streets
for
a
few
weeks
that
is
until
my
greenness
should
wear
off
and
then
to
try
to
sell
goods
to
tenement
housewives
i
threw
myself
into
the
business
with
enthusiasm
but
with
rather
discouraging
results
i
earned
what
i
then
called
a
living
but
made
no
headway
as
a
consequence
my
ardor
cooled
off
it
was
nothing
but
a
daily
grind
my
heart
was
not
in
it
my
landlord
who
was
a
but
who
dreamed
of
business
thought
that
i
lacked
dash
pluck
tenacity
and
the
proprietor
of
the
peddler
supply
store
in
which
i
bought
my
goods
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
for
he
often
chaffed
me
on
the
smallness
of
my
bill
on
one
occasion
he
said
if
you
want
to
make
a
decent
living
you
must
put
all
other
thoughts
out
of
your
mind
and
think
of
nothing
but
your
business
only
my
smiling
little
landlady
was
always
chirping
words
of
encouragement
assuring
me
that
i
was
not
doing
worse
than
the
average
beginner
this
and
her
cordial
manner
were
a
source
of
comfort
to
me
we
became
great
friends
she
taught
me
some
of
her
broken
english
and
i
let
her
talk
of
her
husband
as
long
as
she
wanted
one
of
her
weaknesses
was
to
boast
of
holding
him
under
her
thumb
though
in
reality
she
was
under
his
ceaselessly
gay
in
his
absence
she
would
become
shy
and
reticent
the
moment
he
came
home
i
never
saw
him
talk
to
her
save
to
give
her
some
order
which
she
would
execute
with
feverish
haste
still
in
his
surly
domineering
way
he
was
devoted
to
her
i
was
ever
conscious
of
my
modern
garb
and
as
i
walked
through
the
streets
i
would
repeatedly
throw
glances
at
store
windows
trying
to
catch
my
reflection
in
them
or
else
i
would
pass
my
fingers
across
my
temples
to
feel
the
absence
of
my
it
seemed
a
pity
that
matilda
could
not
see
me
now
one
of
the
trifles
that
have
remained
embedded
in
my
memory
from
those
days
is
the
image
of
a
big
huckster
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
husky
voice
five
cents
a
quart
i
used
to
hear
and
see
him
every
morning
through
the
windows
of
my
lodging
and
to
this
day
whenever
i
hear
the
singsong
of
a
i
scent
the
odors
of
new
york
as
they
struck
me
upon
my
arrival
in
and
i
experience
the
feeling
of
uncertainty
homesickness
and
lovesickness
that
never
left
my
heart
at
that
period
i
often
saw
antomir
in
my
dreams
the
immigrants
from
the
various
russian
galician
or
roumanian
towns
usually
have
their
respective
synagogues
in
new
york
philadelphia
boston
or
chicago
so
i
sought
out
the
house
of
worship
of
the
sons
of
antomir
there
were
scores
perhaps
hundreds
of
small
congregations
on
the
east
side
each
of
which
had
the
use
of
a
single
room
for
the
service
hours
on
saturdays
and
holidays
in
a
building
rented
for
all
sorts
of
gatherings
weddings
dances
lodge
meetings
meetings
and
the
like
the
antomir
congregation
however
was
one
of
those
that
could
afford
a
whole
house
all
to
themselves
our
synagogue
was
a
small
rickety
frame
structure
it
was
for
a
service
that
i
visited
it
for
the
first
time
i
entered
it
with
throbbing
heart
i
prayed
with
great
fervor
when
the
devotions
were
over
i
was
disappointed
to
find
that
the
congregation
contained
not
a
single
worshiper
whom
i
had
known
or
heard
of
at
home
indeed
many
of
them
did
not
even
belong
to
antomir
when
i
told
them
about
my
mother
there
was
a
murmur
of
curiosity
and
sympathy
but
their
interest
in
me
soon
gave
way
to
their
interest
in
the
information
i
could
give
each
of
them
concerning
the
house
and
street
that
had
once
been
his
home
upon
the
advice
of
my
landlord
the
and
largely
with
his
help
i
soon
changed
the
character
of
my
business
i
rented
a
and
tried
to
sell
remnants
of
linen
and
this
turned
out
somewhat
better
than
basket
peddling
but
i
was
one
of
the
common
herd
in
this
branch
of
the
business
as
well
often
i
would
load
my
with
cheap
hosiery
collars
brushes
and
the
like
sometimes
with
several
of
these
articles
at
once
but
more
often
with
one
at
a
time
in
the
latter
case
i
would
announce
to
the
the
glad
news
that
i
had
struck
a
miraculous
bargain
at
a
wholesale
bankruptcy
sale
for
instance
and
exhort
them
not
to
miss
their
golden
opportunity
i
also
learned
to
crumple
up
new
underwear
or
even
to
wet
it
somewhat
and
then
shout
that
i
could
sell
it
so
cheap
because
it
was
slightly
damaged
i
earned
enough
to
pay
my
board
but
i
developed
neither
vim
nor
ardor
for
the
occupation
i
hankered
after
intellectual
interest
and
was
unceasingly
homesick
i
was
greatly
tempted
to
call
on
mr
even
but
deferred
the
visit
until
i
should
make
a
better
showing
i
hated
the
constant
chase
and
scramble
for
bargains
and
i
hated
to
yell
and
scream
in
order
to
create
a
demand
for
my
wares
by
the
sheer
force
of
my
lungs
many
an
illiterate
dolt
easily
outshouted
me
and
thus
dampened
what
little
interest
i
had
mustered
one
fellow
in
particular
was
a
source
of
discouragement
to
me
he
was
a
half
man
with
no
end
of
vocal
energy
and
senseless
fervor
he
was
a
veritable
engine
of
imbecile
vitality
he
would
make
the
street
ring
with
deafening
shrieks
working
his
arms
and
head
sputtering
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
like
a
madman
and
it
produced
results
his
nervous
fit
would
have
a
peculiar
effect
on
the
pedestrians
one
could
not
help
pausing
and
buying
something
of
him
the
block
where
we
usually
did
business
was
one
of
the
best
but
i
hated
him
so
violently
that
i
finally
moved
my
to
a
less
desirable
locality
i
came
home
in
despair
oh
it
takes
a
blockhead
to
make
a
success
of
it
i
complained
to
dienstog
why
why
she
consoled
me
it
is
a
sin
to
be
grumbling
like
that
there
are
lots
of
peddlers
who
have
been
years
in
america
and
who
would
be
glad
to
earn
as
much
as
you
do
it
be
all
right
do
worry
mr
levinsky
it
was
less
than
a
fortnight
before
i
changed
my
place
of
business
once
again
the
only
thing
by
which
these
few
days
became
fixed
in
my
memory
was
the
teeth
of
a
young
man
named
volodsky
and
the
peculiar
tale
of
woe
he
told
me
he
was
a
homely
man
but
his
teeth
were
so
beautiful
that
their
glistening
whiteness
irritated
me
somewhat
they
were
his
own
natural
teeth
but
i
thought
them
out
of
place
amid
his
plain
features
or
amid
the
features
of
any
other
man
for
that
matter
they
seemed
to
be
more
suited
to
the
face
of
a
woman
his
was
next
to
mine
but
he
sold
or
tried
to
sell
hardware
while
my
cart
was
laden
with
other
goods
and
as
he
was
moreover
as
much
of
a
failure
as
i
was
there
was
no
reason
why
we
should
not
be
friends
so
we
would
spend
the
day
in
talks
of
our
hard
luck
and
homesickness
his
chief
worry
was
over
the
dower
money
which
he
had
borrowed
of
his
sister
at
home
to
pay
for
his
passage
she
gave
it
to
me
cheerfully
he
said
in
a
brooding
listless
way
she
thought
i
would
send
it
back
to
her
at
once
people
over
there
think
treasure
can
really
be
had
for
the
picking
in
america
well
i
have
been
over
two
years
here
and
have
not
been
able
to
send
her
a
cent
her
letters
make
holes
in
my
heart
she
has
a
good
marriage
chance
so
she
says
and
unless
i
send
her
the
money
at
once
it
will
be
off
her
lamentations
will
drive
me
into
the
grave
chapter
iv
i
soon
had
to
move
from
the
dienstogs
to
make
room
for
a
relative
of
the
who
had
arrived
from
england
my
second
lodgings
were
an
exact
copy
of
my
first
a
lounge
in
a
kitchen
serving
me
as
a
bed
to
add
to
the
similarity
my
new
landlady
was
incessantly
singing
only
she
had
three
children
and
her
songs
were
all
in
yiddish
her
ordinary
speech
teemed
with
oaths
like
strike
me
blind
may
i
not
be
able
to
move
my
arms
or
my
legs
may
i
spend
every
cent
of
it
on
doctor
bills
may
i
not
be
able
to
get
up
from
this
chair
a
great
many
of
our
women
will
spice
their
yiddish
with
this
kind
of
imprecations
but
she
was
far
above
the
average
in
this
respect
the
curious
thing
about
her
was
that
her
name
was
levinsky
though
we
were
not
related
in
the
remotest
degree
whatever
enthusiasm
there
was
in
me
found
vent
in
religion
i
spent
many
an
evening
at
the
antomir
synagogue
reading
talmud
passionately
this
would
bring
my
heart
in
touch
with
my
old
home
with
dear
old
reb
sender
with
the
grave
of
my
poor
mother
it
was
the
only
pleasure
i
had
in
those
days
and
it
seemed
to
be
the
highest
i
had
ever
enjoyed
at
times
i
would
feel
the
tears
coming
to
my
eyes
for
the
sheer
joy
of
hearing
my
own
singsong
my
old
antomir
singsong
it
was
like
an
echo
from
the
preacher
synagogue
my
former
self
was
addressing
me
across
the
sea
in
this
strange
uninviting
big
town
where
i
was
compelled
to
peddle
or
and
to
compete
with
a
yelling
idiot
i
would
picture
my
mother
gazing
at
me
as
i
stood
at
my
i
could
almost
see
her
slapping
her
hands
in
despair
as
for
my
love
it
had
settled
down
to
a
chronic
dull
pain
that
asserted
itself
on
special
occasions
only
i
was
so
homesick
that
my
former
lodging
in
new
york
to
which
i
had
become
used
now
seemed
like
home
by
comparison
i
missed
the
dienstogs
keenly
and
i
visited
them
quite
often
i
wrote
long
passionate
letters
to
reb
sender
in
a
conglomeration
of
the
talmudic
jargon
bad
hebrew
and
good
yiddish
referring
to
the
talmud
studies
i
pursued
in
america
and
pouring
out
my
forlorn
heart
to
him
his
affectionate
answers
brought
me
inexpressible
happiness
but
many
of
the
other
peddlers
made
fun
of
my
piety
and
it
could
not
last
long
moreover
i
was
in
contact
with
life
now
and
the
daily
surprises
it
had
in
store
for
me
dealt
my
former
ideas
of
the
world
blow
after
blow
i
saw
the
cunning
and
the
meanness
of
some
of
my
customers
of
the
tradespeople
of
whom
i
bought
my
wares
and
of
the
peddlers
who
did
business
by
my
side
nor
was
i
unaware
of
certain
unlovable
traits
that
were
unavoidably
developing
in
my
own
self
under
these
influences
and
while
human
nature
was
thus
growing
smaller
the
human
world
as
a
whole
was
growing
larger
more
complex
more
heartless
and
more
interesting
the
striking
thing
was
that
it
was
not
a
world
of
piety
i
spoke
to
scores
of
people
and
i
saw
tens
of
thousands
very
few
of
the
women
who
passed
my
wore
wigs
and
men
who
did
not
shave
were
an
exception
also
i
knew
that
many
of
the
people
with
whom
i
came
in
daily
contact
openly
patronized
gentile
restaurants
and
would
not
hesitate
even
to
eat
pork
the
orthodox
jewish
faith
as
it
is
followed
in
the
old
ghetto
towns
of
russia
or
austria
has
still
to
learn
the
art
of
trimming
its
sails
to
suit
new
winds
it
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
a
thousand
years
ago
it
does
not
attempt
to
adopt
itself
to
modern
conditions
as
the
christian
church
is
continually
doing
it
is
absolutely
inflexible
if
you
are
a
jew
of
the
type
to
which
i
belonged
when
i
came
to
new
york
and
you
attempt
to
bend
your
religion
to
the
spirit
of
your
new
surroundings
it
breaks
it
falls
to
pieces
the
very
clothes
i
wore
and
the
very
food
i
ate
had
a
fatal
effect
on
my
religious
habits
a
whole
book
could
be
written
on
the
influence
of
a
starched
collar
and
a
necktie
on
a
man
who
was
brought
up
as
i
was
it
was
inevitable
that
sooner
or
later
i
should
let
a
barber
shave
my
sprouting
beard
what
do
you
want
those
things
for
levinsky
once
said
to
me
pointing
at
my
nascent
whiskers
oh
go
take
a
shave
and
do
be
a
fool
it
will
make
you
ever
so
much
may
my
luck
be
as
handsome
as
your
face
will
then
be
never
i
retorted
testily
yet
blushing
she
gave
a
sarcastic
snort
they
all
speak
like
that
at
the
beginning
she
said
the
girls
will
make
you
shave
if
nobody
else
does
what
girls
i
asked
with
a
scowl
but
blushing
once
again
what
do
i
know
what
girls
she
laughed
that
your
own
lookout
not
mine
i
did
not
like
her
she
was
provokingly
crafty
and
cold
and
she
had
a
mean
smile
and
a
dishonest
voice
that
often
irritated
me
she
was
and
bursting
with
health
taller
than
dienstog
yet
too
short
for
her
great
breadth
of
shoulder
and
the
enormous
bulk
of
her
bust
i
thought
she
looked
absurdly
dumpy
what
i
particularly
hated
in
her
was
her
laughter
which
sounded
for
all
the
world
like
the
gobble
of
a
turkey
she
was
constantly
importuning
me
to
get
her
another
lodger
who
would
share
her
kitchen
lounge
with
me
rent
is
so
high
i
am
losing
money
on
you
may
i
have
a
year
of
darkness
if
i
am
not
she
would
din
in
my
ears
she
was
intolerable
to
me
but
i
liked
her
cooking
and
i
hated
to
be
moving
again
so
i
remained
several
months
in
her
house
it
was
not
long
before
her
prediction
as
to
the
fate
of
my
beard
came
true
i
took
a
shave
what
actually
decided
me
to
commit
so
heinous
a
sin
was
a
remark
dropped
by
one
of
the
peddlers
that
my
face
made
me
look
like
a
green
one
it
was
the
most
cruel
thing
he
could
have
told
me
i
took
a
look
at
myself
as
soon
as
i
could
get
near
a
mirror
and
the
next
day
i
received
my
first
shave
what
would
reb
sender
say
i
thought
when
i
came
home
that
evening
i
was
extremely
ill
at
ease
levinsky
noticed
the
change
at
once
but
she
also
noticed
my
embarrassment
so
she
said
nothing
but
she
was
continually
darting
furtive
glances
at
me
and
when
our
eyes
met
she
seemed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
bursting
into
one
of
her
turkey
laughs
i
could
have
murdered
her
book
vi
a
greenhorn
no
longer
chapter
i
i
bought
my
goods
in
several
places
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
many
peddlers
one
of
these
attracted
my
attention
by
his
popularity
among
the
other
men
and
by
his
peculiar
talks
of
women
his
name
was
max
margolis
we
used
to
speak
of
him
as
big
max
to
distinguish
him
from
a
little
max
till
one
day
a
peddler
who
was
a
good
and
was
then
studying
algebra
changed
the
two
names
to
maximum
max
and
minimum
max
which
the
other
peddlers
pronounced
maxie
max
and
minnie
max
some
of
the
other
fellows
too
were
addicted
to
obscene
but
these
mostly
made
or
pretended
to
make
a
joke
of
it
the
man
who
had
changed
max
sobriquet
for
instance
never
tired
of
composing
smutty
puns
while
another
man
who
had
a
married
daughter
was
continually
hinting
with
merry
bravado
at
his
illicit
successes
with
gentile
women
maximum
max
on
the
other
hand
would
treat
his
lascivious
topics
with
peculiar
earnestness
and
even
with
something
like
sadness
as
though
he
dwelt
on
them
in
spite
of
himself
under
the
stress
of
an
obsession
otherwise
he
was
a
jovial
fellow
he
was
a
tall
man
loosely
built
his
lips
were
always
moist
and
when
closed
they
were
never
in
tight
contact
he
had
the
reputation
of
a
liar
and
as
is
often
the
case
with
those
who
suffer
from
that
weakness
people
liked
him
nor
indeed
were
his
fibs
as
a
rule
made
out
of
whole
cloth
they
usually
had
a
basis
of
truth
when
he
told
a
story
and
he
felt
that
it
was
producing
no
effect
he
would
play
it
up
as
newspapermen
would
put
it
often
quite
grotesquely
altogether
he
was
so
inclined
to
overemphasize
and
embellish
his
facts
that
it
was
not
always
easy
to
say
where
truth
ended
and
fiction
began
somehow
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
moistness
and
looseness
of
his
lips
had
something
to
do
with
his
mendacity
he
was
an
ignorant
man
barely
able
to
write
down
an
address
max
was
an
instalment
peddler
his
chief
business
being
with
frequenters
of
to
whom
he
sold
clothing
jewelry
and
when
there
was
a
marriage
among
them
furniture
many
a
young
housewife
who
had
met
her
predestined
one
in
one
of
these
halls
wore
a
marriage
ring
and
had
her
front
room
furnished
with
a
parlor
set
bought
of
max
margolis
he
was
as
popular
among
the
dancers
as
he
was
among
the
men
he
met
at
the
stores
he
was
married
max
yet
it
was
as
much
by
his
interest
in
the
dancers
as
by
his
business
interest
that
he
was
drawn
to
the
he
took
a
fancy
to
me
and
he
often
made
me
listen
to
his
discourses
on
women
the
youngest
married
man
usually
appealed
to
me
as
being
old
enough
to
be
my
father
and
as
maximum
max
was
not
only
married
but
eleven
years
my
senior
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
chasm
between
us
that
he
should
hold
this
kind
of
conversations
with
an
unmarried
youngster
like
myself
struck
me
as
something
unnatural
doubly
indecent
as
i
listened
i
would
feel
awkward
but
would
listen
nevertheless
one
day
he
looked
me
over
much
as
an
expert
in
horseflesh
would
a
colt
and
said
with
the
utmost
seriousness
do
you
know
levinsky
you
have
an
awfully
fine
figure
you
are
a
chap
all
around
for
that
matter
a
fellow
like
you
ought
to
make
a
hit
with
women
why
do
you
learn
to
dance
the
compliment
made
me
wince
and
blush
perhaps
if
he
had
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
jest
i
should
even
have
liked
it
as
it
was
i
felt
like
one
stripped
in
public
still
i
recalled
with
pleasure
that
matilda
had
said
similar
things
about
my
figure
why
do
you
learn
to
dance
levinsky
he
repeated
i
laughed
waving
the
suggestion
aside
as
a
joke
on
another
occasion
he
said
every
woman
can
be
won
absolutely
every
one
provided
a
fellow
knows
how
to
go
about
it
as
he
proceeded
to
develop
his
theory
he
described
various
types
of
women
and
the
various
methods
to
be
used
with
them
of
course
the
man
must
not
be
repulsive
to
her
he
said
that
evening
when
levinsky
husband
their
three
children
and
myself
sat
around
the
table
and
she
was
serving
us
our
supper
she
appeared
in
a
new
light
to
me
she
was
nearly
twice
my
age
and
i
hated
her
not
only
for
her
meanness
and
low
cunning
but
also
for
her
massive
figure
and
for
her
turkey
laugh
but
she
was
a
healthy
female
after
all
so
as
i
looked
at
her
bustling
between
the
table
and
the
stove
rule
came
back
to
me
i
could
almost
hear
his
voice
every
woman
can
be
won
absolutely
every
one
levinsky
oldest
child
was
a
young
man
of
nearly
my
age
yet
i
looked
her
over
lustfully
and
when
i
found
that
her
florid
skin
was
almost
spotless
her
lips
fresh
and
her
black
hair
without
a
hint
of
gray
i
was
glad
presently
while
removing
my
plate
she
threw
the
trembling
bulk
of
her
great
firm
bust
under
my
very
eyes
i
felt
disturbed
some
morning
when
we
are
alone
i
said
to
myself
i
shall
kiss
those
red
lips
of
hers
from
that
moment
on
she
was
my
quarry
as
her
husband
worked
in
a
sweatshop
while
i
peddled
he
usually
got
up
at
least
an
hour
before
me
and
it
was
considered
perfectly
natural
that
levinsky
should
be
hovering
about
the
kitchen
while
i
was
sleeping
or
lying
awake
on
the
kitchen
lounge
also
that
after
her
husband
left
for
the
day
i
should
go
around
washing
and
dressing
myself
in
the
same
crowded
little
room
in
which
she
was
then
doing
her
work
as
scantily
clad
as
i
was
and
with
the
sleeves
of
her
flimsy
blouse
rolled
up
to
her
armpits
i
had
never
noticed
these
things
before
but
on
the
morning
following
the
above
supper
i
did
as
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
her
bare
fleshy
arms
held
out
toward
the
little
i
thought
of
my
resolve
to
kiss
her
she
was
humming
something
in
a
very
low
voice
to
let
her
know
that
i
was
awake
i
stretched
myself
and
yawned
audibly
her
voice
rose
it
was
a
song
from
a
jewish
play
she
was
singing
good
mornings
levinsky
i
greeted
her
in
a
familiar
tone
which
she
now
heard
for
the
first
time
from
me
you
seem
to
be
in
good
spirits
this
morning
she
was
evidently
taken
aback
i
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
she
would
have
expected
to
address
a
remark
of
this
kind
to
her
how
can
you
see
it
she
asked
with
a
at
me
have
i
no
ears
do
i
hear
your
beautiful
singing
beautiful
singing
she
said
without
looking
at
me
after
a
considerable
pause
i
said
awkwardly
you
know
levinsky
i
dreamed
of
you
last
night
did
you
are
you
interested
to
know
something
more
about
it
i
dreamed
of
telling
you
that
you
are
a
lady
i
pursued
with
heart
what
has
got
into
that
fellow
she
asked
of
the
he
is
a
greenhorn
no
longer
as
true
as
i
am
alive
you
deny
you
are
will
you
what
is
that
to
you
and
again
addressing
herself
to
the
what
do
you
think
of
that
fellow
a
pious
talmudist
indeed
strike
me
blind
if
i
ever
saw
one
like
that
and
she
uttered
a
chuckle
i
saw
encouragement
in
her
manner
i
went
on
to
talk
of
her
songs
and
the
jewish
theater
a
topic
for
which
i
knew
her
to
have
a
singular
weakness
the
upshot
was
that
i
soon
had
her
telling
me
of
a
play
she
had
recently
seen
as
she
spoke
it
was
inevitable
that
she
should
come
up
close
to
the
lounge
as
she
did
so
her
fingers
touched
my
quilt
her
bare
sturdy
arms
paralyzing
my
attention
the
temptation
to
grasp
them
was
tightening
its
grip
on
me
i
decided
to
begin
by
taking
hold
of
her
hand
i
warned
myself
that
it
must
be
done
gently
with
romance
in
my
touch
i
shall
just
caress
her
hand
i
decided
not
hearing
a
word
of
what
she
was
saving
i
brought
my
hand
close
to
hers
my
heart
beat
violently
i
was
just
about
to
touch
her
fingers
but
i
let
the
opportunity
pass
i
turned
the
conversation
on
her
husband
on
his
devotion
to
her
on
their
wedding
she
mocked
my
questions
but
answered
them
all
the
same
he
must
have
been
awfully
in
love
with
you
i
said
what
business
is
that
of
yours
where
did
you
learn
to
ask
such
questions
at
the
synagogue
of
course
he
loved
me
what
would
you
have
that
he
should
have
hated
me
why
did
he
marry
me
then
of
course
he
was
in
love
with
me
else
i
would
not
have
married
him
would
i
are
you
satisfied
now
she
boasted
of
the
rich
and
suitors
she
had
rejected
i
felt
that
i
had
my
flirtation
touching
her
hand
would
have
been
out
of
place
now
a
few
minutes
later
when
i
was
saying
my
morning
prayers
i
carefully
kept
my
eyes
away
from
her
lest
i
should
meet
her
sneering
glance
when
i
had
finished
my
devotions
and
had
put
my
phylacteries
into
their
little
bag
i
sat
down
to
breakfast
i
do
like
this
woman
at
all
i
said
to
myself
looking
at
her
in
fact
i
abhor
her
why
then
am
i
so
crazy
to
carry
on
with
her
it
was
the
same
question
that
i
had
once
asked
myself
concerning
my
contradictory
feelings
for
red
esther
but
my
knowledge
of
life
had
grown
considerably
since
then
in
those
days
i
had
made
the
discovery
that
there
were
kisses
prompted
by
affection
and
kisses
prompted
by
satan
i
now
added
that
even
love
of
the
flesh
might
be
of
two
distinct
kinds
there
is
love
of
body
and
soul
and
there
is
a
kind
of
love
that
is
of
the
body
only
i
theorized
there
is
love
and
there
is
lust
i
thought
of
my
feeling
for
matilda
that
certainly
was
love
various
details
of
my
relations
with
matilda
came
back
to
me
during
these
days
one
afternoon
as
i
was
brooding
over
these
recollections
while
passively
awaiting
customers
at
my
cart
i
conjured
up
that
night
scene
when
she
sat
on
the
great
green
sofa
and
i
went
into
ecstasies
speaking
of
my
prospective
studies
for
admission
to
a
russian
university
i
recalled
how
she
had
been
irritated
with
me
for
talking
too
loud
and
how
calling
me
talmud
student
or
ninny
she
had
abruptly
left
the
room
i
had
thought
of
the
scene
a
hundred
times
before
but
now
a
new
interpretation
of
it
flashed
through
my
mind
it
all
seemed
so
obvious
i
certainly
had
been
a
ninny
an
idiot
i
burst
into
a
sarcastic
titter
at
matilda
expense
and
my
own
of
course
i
was
a
ninny
i
scoffed
at
myself
again
and
again
i
saw
matilda
from
a
new
angle
it
was
as
if
she
had
suddenly
slipped
off
her
pedestal
instead
of
lamenting
my
fallen
idol
however
i
gloated
over
her
fall
and
instead
of
growing
cold
to
her
i
felt
that
she
was
nearer
to
me
than
ever
nearer
and
dearer
chapter
ii
one
morning
after
breakfast
when
i
was
about
to
leave
the
house
and
levinsky
was
detaining
me
trying
to
exact
a
promise
that
i
should
get
somebody
to
share
the
lounge
with
me
i
said
i
see
about
it
i
must
be
going
at
this
i
took
her
hand
ostensibly
in
farewell
she
said
coloring
and
trying
to
free
herself
i
repeated
shaking
her
hand
gently
and
smiling
upon
her
she
wrenched
out
her
hand
i
took
hold
of
her
chin
but
she
shook
it
free
do
she
said
shyly
turning
away
what
the
matter
i
said
gaily
she
faced
about
again
i
tell
you
what
the
matter
is
she
said
if
you
do
that
again
you
will
have
to
move
if
you
think
i
am
one
of
those
landladies
you
know
the
kind
i
mean
you
are
mistaken
she
uttered
it
in
calm
rather
amicable
accents
so
i
replied
why
why
of
course
i
do
indeed
you
are
the
most
respectable
and
the
most
woman
in
the
world
i
stepped
up
close
to
ner
and
reached
out
my
hand
to
seize
hold
of
her
bare
arm
none
of
that
mister
she
flared
up
drawing
back
keep
your
hands
where
they
belong
if
you
try
that
again
i
break
every
bone
in
your
body
may
both
my
hands
be
paralyzed
if
i
do
i
implored
which
only
added
fuel
to
her
rage
nothing
i
call
in
all
the
neighbors
of
the
house
and
tell
them
the
kind
of
pious
man
you
are
saying
his
prayers
three
times
a
day
indeed
i
sneaked
out
of
the
house
like
a
thief
i
was
wretched
all
day
wondering
how
i
should
come
to
supper
in
the
evening
i
wondered
whether
she
was
going
to
deliver
me
over
to
the
jealous
wrath
of
her
husband
i
should
have
willingly
forfeited
my
trunk
and
settled
in
another
place
but
levinsky
had
an
approximate
knowledge
of
the
places
where
i
was
likely
to
do
business
and
there
was
the
danger
of
a
scene
from
her
maximum
max
theory
did
not
seem
to
count
for
much
but
then
he
had
said
that
one
must
know
how
to
go
about
it
perhaps
i
had
been
too
hasty
late
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
levinsky
came
to
see
me
pretending
to
be
passing
along
on
some
errand
she
paused
in
front
of
my
cart
accosting
me
pleasantly
i
bet
you
are
angry
with
me
she
said
smiling
broadly
i
am
not
angry
at
all
i
answered
with
feigned
moroseness
but
you
certainly
have
a
tongue
whew
and
well
you
ca
take
a
joke
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
levinsky
may
my
luck
be
as
good
as
is
my
friendship
for
you
i
certainly
wish
you
no
evil
may
god
give
me
all
the
things
i
wish
you
i
just
want
you
to
behave
yourself
that
all
i
am
so
much
older
than
you
anyhow
look
for
somebody
of
your
own
age
you
are
not
angry
at
me
are
you
she
added
suavely
she
simply
could
not
afford
to
lose
the
rent
i
paid
her
since
then
she
held
herself
at
a
respectful
distance
from
me
i
called
on
smiling
dienstog
my
former
landlady
in
whose
house
i
was
no
stranger
i
timed
this
visit
at
an
hour
when
i
knew
her
to
be
alone
in
this
venture
i
met
with
scarcely
any
resistance
at
first
she
let
me
hold
her
hand
and
caress
it
and
tell
her
how
soft
and
tender
it
was
do
you
think
so
she
said
coyly
her
eyes
clouding
with
embarrassment
i
do
think
they
are
soft
at
all
they
would
be
if
i
did
not
have
so
much
washing
and
scrubbing
to
do
then
she
added
sadly
america
has
made
a
servant
of
me
a
land
of
gold
indeed
when
i
was
in
my
father
house
i
did
not
have
to
scrub
floors
i
attempted
to
raise
her
wrist
to
my
lips
but
she
checked
me
she
did
not
break
away
from
me
however
she
held
me
off
but
she
did
not
let
go
of
the
index
finger
of
my
right
hand
which
she
clutched
with
all
her
might
playfully
as
we
struggled
we
both
laughed
nervously
at
last
i
wrenched
my
finger
from
her
grip
and
before
she
had
time
to
thwart
my
purpose
she
was
in
my
arms
i
was
aiming
a
kiss
at
her
lips
but
she
continued
to
turn
and
twist
trying
to
clap
her
hand
over
my
mouth
as
she
did
so
and
my
kiss
landed
on
one
side
of
her
chin
just
one
more
dearest
i
raved
only
one
on
your
sweet
little
lips
my
dove
only
one
only
one
she
yielded
our
lips
joined
in
a
feverish
kiss
then
she
thrust
me
away
from
her
and
after
a
pause
shook
her
finger
at
me
with
a
gesture
as
much
as
to
say
you
must
not
do
that
bad
boy
you
i
went
away
in
high
feather
i
called
on
dienstog
again
the
very
next
morning
she
received
me
well
but
the
first
thing
she
did
after
returning
my
greeting
was
to
throw
the
door
wide
open
and
to
offer
me
a
chair
in
full
view
of
the
hallway
oh
shut
the
door
i
whispered
in
disgust
do
be
foolish
she
shook
her
head
just
one
kiss
i
begged
her
you
are
so
sweet
she
held
firm
i
came
away
sorely
disappointed
but
convinced
that
her
inflexibility
was
a
mere
matter
of
practical
common
sense
i
kept
these
experiences
and
reflections
to
myself
nor
did
an
indecent
word
ever
cross
my
lips
in
the
street
while
attending
to
my
business
i
heard
uncouth
language
quite
often
the
other
men
would
utter
the
most
revolting
improprieties
in
the
hearing
of
the
women
peddlers
or
even
address
such
talk
to
them
as
a
matter
of
course
nor
was
it
an
uncommon
incident
for
a
peddler
to
fire
a
volley
of
obscenities
at
a
departing
housewife
who
had
priced
something
on
his
cart
without
buying
it
these
things
scandalized
me
beyond
words
i
could
never
get
accustomed
to
them
look
at
levinsky
standing
there
quiet
as
a
kitten
the
other
peddlers
would
twit
me
one
would
think
he
is
so
innocent
he
does
know
how
to
count
two
shy
young
fellows
are
the
worst
devils
in
the
world
they
were
partly
mistaken
during
the
first
few
weeks
of
our
acquaintance
at
least
for
the
last
thread
that
bound
me
to
chastity
was
still
unbroken
it
was
rapidly
wearing
away
though
chapter
iii
the
last
thread
snapped
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
period
of
unrestrained
misconduct
intoxicated
by
the
novelty
of
yielding
to
satan
i
gave
him
a
free
hand
and
the
result
was
months
of
debauchery
and
the
underworld
women
i
met
the
humdrum
filth
of
their
life
and
their
attitude
toward
it
never
ceased
to
shock
and
repel
me
i
never
left
a
creature
of
this
kind
without
abominating
her
and
myself
yet
i
would
soon
sometimes
during
the
very
same
evening
call
on
her
again
or
on
some
other
woman
of
her
class
many
of
these
women
would
simulate
love
but
they
failed
to
deceive
me
i
knew
that
they
lied
and
shammed
to
me
just
as
i
did
to
my
customers
and
their
insincerities
were
only
another
source
of
repugnance
to
me
but
i
frequented
them
in
spite
of
it
all
in
spite
of
myself
i
spent
on
them
more
than
i
could
afford
sometimes
i
would
borrow
money
or
pawn
something
for
the
purpose
of
calling
on
them
the
fact
that
these
wretched
women
were
not
segregated
as
they
were
in
my
native
town
probably
had
something
to
do
with
it
instead
of
being
confined
to
a
fixed
locality
they
were
allowed
to
live
in
the
same
with
respectable
people
beckoning
to
men
from
the
front
steps
under
open
protection
from
the
police
indeed
the
police
as
silent
partners
in
the
profits
of
their
shame
plainly
encouraged
this
vice
traffic
all
of
which
undoubtedly
helped
to
make
a
profligate
of
me
but
of
course
it
would
be
preposterous
to
charge
it
all
or
even
chiefly
to
the
police
my
wild
oats
were
flavored
with
a
sense
of
my
failure
as
a
business
man
by
my
homesickness
and
passion
for
matilda
my
bored
me
i
was
hungry
for
intellectual
interest
for
novel
sensations
i
was
restless
sometimes
i
would
stop
from
business
in
the
middle
of
the
day
to
plunge
into
a
page
of
talmud
at
some
synagogue
and
sometimes
i
would
lay
down
the
holy
book
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
betake
myself
to
the
residence
of
some
fallen
woman
in
my
loneliness
i
would
look
for
some
human
element
in
my
acquaintance
with
these
women
i
would
ply
them
with
questions
about
their
antecedents
their
family
connections
as
my
mother
had
done
the
girl
from
that
street
as
a
rule
my
questions
bored
them
and
their
answers
were
obvious
fabrications
but
there
were
some
exceptions
one
of
these
a
plump
handsome
female
named
bertha
occupied
two
tiny
rooms
in
which
she
lived
with
her
daughter
one
of
the
two
rooms
was
often
full
of
men
some
of
them
with
heavy
beards
who
would
sit
there
each
awaiting
his
turn
as
patients
do
in
the
of
a
physician
and
whiling
their
time
away
by
chaffing
the
little
girl
upon
her
mother
occupation
and
her
own
future
some
of
the
questions
and
jokes
they
would
address
to
her
were
of
the
most
revolting
nature
whereupon
she
would
reply
oh
go
to
hell
or
stick
out
her
tongue
resentfully
one
day
i
asked
bertha
why
she
was
giving
her
child
this
sort
of
bringing
up
i
once
tried
to
keep
her
in
another
place
with
a
respectable
family
she
replied
ruefully
but
she
would
not
stay
there
besides
i
missed
her
so
much
i
could
not
stand
it
another
fallen
woman
who
was
frank
with
me
proved
to
be
a
native
of
antomir
when
she
heard
that
i
was
from
the
same
place
she
flushed
with
excitement
go
away
she
shouted
you
fooling
me
we
talked
of
the
streets
lanes
and
yards
of
our
birthplace
she
hailing
every
name
i
uttered
with
outbursts
of
wistful
enthusiasm
i
wondered
whether
she
knew
of
my
mother
sensational
death
but
i
never
disclosed
my
identity
to
her
though
she
on
her
part
told
me
with
impetuous
frankness
the
whole
story
of
her
life
you
are
a
talmudist
are
you
she
asked
how
do
you
know
how
do
i
know
as
if
it
could
not
be
seen
by
your
face
a
little
later
she
said
i
am
sorry
you
came
here
honest
you
should
have
stayed
at
home
and
stuck
to
your
holy
books
it
would
have
been
a
thousand
times
better
than
coming
to
america
and
calling
on
girls
like
myself
honest
she
was
known
as
argentine
rachael
it
was
from
her
that
i
first
heard
of
the
relations
existing
between
the
underworld
and
the
police
of
new
york
but
then
my
idea
of
the
russian
police
had
always
been
associated
in
my
mind
with
everything
cruel
and
dishonest
so
the
corruption
of
the
new
york
police
did
not
seem
to
be
anything
unusual
one
day
she
said
to
me
if
you
want
a
good
street
corner
for
your
cart
i
can
fix
it
for
you
i
know
leary
who
is
he
why
have
you
never
heard
about
him
is
he
a
big
police
officer
bigger
the
police
are
afraid
of
him
why
because
he
is
the
boss
he
is
the
district
leader
what
he
says
goes
she
went
on
to
explain
that
he
was
the
local
chieftain
of
the
dominant
politician
party
as
she
termed
it
what
is
a
politician
party
i
asked
she
tried
to
define
it
and
failing
in
her
attempt
she
said
with
a
giggle
oh
you
are
a
boob
you
certainly
are
a
green
one
why
it
an
organization
a
lot
of
people
who
stick
together
do
you
know
she
talked
on
and
the
upshot
was
that
i
formed
a
conception
of
political
parties
as
of
a
kind
of
competing
business
companies
whose
specialty
it
was
to
make
millions
by
ruling
some
big
city
levying
tribute
on
fallen
women
thieves
and
doing
favors
to
friends
and
meting
out
punishment
to
foes
i
learned
also
that
leary
owed
his
surname
to
a
celebrated
pair
of
diamond
said
to
have
cost
him
fifteen
thousand
dollars
from
which
he
never
was
separated
and
by
the
blaze
of
which
he
could
be
recognized
at
a
distance
well
shall
i
speak
to
him
about
you
she
asked
i
gave
her
an
evasive
answer
why
do
you
want
to
have
favors
from
a
girl
like
me
she
laughed
i
colored
whereupon
she
remarked
reflectively
i
do
blame
you
either
she
never
tired
talking
of
our
birthplace
are
you
homesick
she
once
demanded
not
a
bit
i
answered
with
bravado
then
you
have
no
heart
i
have
been
away
five
times
as
long
as
you
yet
i
am
homesick
really
honest
she
was
as
repellent
to
me
as
the
rest
of
her
class
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
accept
a
cup
of
tea
from
her
hands
and
yet
i
could
not
help
liking
her
spirit
she
was
truthful
and
affectionate
this
and
above
all
her
yearning
for
our
common
birthplace
appealed
to
me
strongly
i
was
very
much
inclined
to
think
that
in
spite
of
the
horrible
life
she
led
she
was
a
good
girl
to
hold
this
sort
of
opinion
about
a
woman
of
her
kind
seemed
to
be
an
improper
thing
to
do
i
knew
that
according
to
the
conventional
idea
concerning
women
of
the
street
they
were
all
the
most
hideous
creatures
in
the
world
in
every
respect
so
i
would
tell
myself
that
i
must
consider
her
too
one
of
the
most
hideous
creatures
in
the
world
in
every
respect
but
i
did
not
for
i
knew
that
at
heart
she
was
better
than
some
of
the
most
respectable
people
i
had
met
it
was
one
of
the
astonishing
discrepancies
i
had
discovered
in
the
world
also
it
was
one
of
the
things
i
had
found
to
be
totally
different
from
what
people
usually
thought
they
were
i
was
gradually
realizing
that
the
average
man
or
woman
was
full
of
all
sorts
of
false
notions
chapter
iv
i
enrolled
in
a
public
evening
school
i
threw
myself
into
my
new
studies
with
unbounded
enthusiasm
after
all
it
was
a
matter
of
something
in
which
i
felt
at
home
some
of
my
classmates
had
a
much
better
practical
acquaintance
with
english
than
i
but
few
of
these
could
best
the
mental
training
that
my
talmud
education
had
given
me
as
a
consequence
i
found
things
irksomely
slow
still
the
teacher
a
young
east
side
dude
and
girlish
of
feature
and
voice
was
a
talkative
fellow
with
oratorical
proclivities
and
his
garrulousness
was
of
great
value
to
me
he
was
of
german
descent
and
as
i
subsequently
learned
from
private
conversations
with
him
his
mother
was
like
himself
so
english
was
his
in
the
full
sense
of
the
term
he
would
either
address
us
wholly
in
that
tongue
or
intersperse
it
with
interpretations
in
labored
german
which
thanks
to
my
native
yiddish
i
had
no
difficulty
in
understanding
his
name
was
bender
at
first
i
did
not
like
him
yet
i
would
hang
on
his
lips
striving
to
memorize
every
english
word
i
could
catch
and
watching
intently
not
only
his
enunciation
but
also
his
gestures
manners
and
mannerisms
and
accepting
it
all
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
american
way
of
speaking
sign
language
which
was
the
chief
means
of
communication
in
the
early
days
of
mankind
still
holds
its
own
it
retains
sway
over
nations
of
the
highest
culture
with
tongues
of
unlimited
wealth
and
variety
and
the
gestures
of
the
various
countries
are
as
different
as
their
spoken
languages
the
gesticulations
and
facial
expressions
with
which
an
american
will
supplement
his
english
are
as
distinctively
american
as
those
of
a
frenchman
are
distinctively
french
one
can
tell
the
nationality
of
a
stranger
by
his
gestures
as
readily
as
by
his
language
in
a
vague
general
way
i
had
become
aware
of
this
before
probably
from
contact
with
some
jews
whose
gesticulations
when
they
spoke
yiddish
impressed
me
as
utterly
and
so
i
studied
bender
gestures
almost
as
closely
as
i
did
his
words
even
the
slight
lisp
in
his
s
i
accepted
as
part
of
the
real
yankee
utterance
nor
indeed
was
this
unnatural
in
view
of
the
th
sound
that
of
every
foreigner
whom
it
must
needs
strike
as
a
lisp
bender
spoke
with
a
nasal
twang
which
i
am
now
inclined
to
think
he
paraded
as
an
accessory
to
the
drawl
he
affected
in
the
but
then
i
had
noticed
this
kind
of
twang
in
the
delivery
of
other
americans
as
well
so
altogether
english
impressed
me
as
the
language
of
a
people
afflicted
with
defective
organs
of
speech
or
else
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
americans
had
normal
organs
of
speech
but
that
they
made
special
efforts
to
distort
the
t
into
a
th
and
the
v
into
a
one
of
the
things
i
discovered
was
the
unsmiling
smile
i
often
saw
it
on
bender
and
on
other
native
americans
on
the
principal
of
the
school
for
instance
who
was
an
in
russia
among
the
people
i
knew
at
least
one
either
smiled
or
not
here
i
found
a
peculiar
kind
of
smile
that
was
not
a
smile
it
would
flash
up
into
a
lifeless
flame
and
forthwith
go
out
again
leaving
the
face
cold
and
stiff
they
laugh
with
their
teeth
only
i
would
say
to
myself
but
of
course
i
saw
real
smiles
too
on
americans
and
i
instinctively
learned
to
discern
the
smile
of
mere
politeness
from
the
sort
that
came
from
one
heart
nevertheless
one
evening
when
we
were
reading
in
our
that
kate
had
a
smile
for
everybody
and
i
saw
that
this
was
stated
in
praise
of
kate
i
had
a
disagreeable
vision
of
a
little
girl
going
around
the
streets
and
grinning
upon
everybody
she
met
i
abhorred
the
teacher
for
his
girlish
looks
and
affectations
but
his
twang
and
th
made
me
literally
pant
with
hatred
at
the
same
time
i
strained
every
nerve
to
imitate
him
in
these
very
sounds
it
was
a
hard
struggle
and
when
i
had
overcome
all
difficulties
at
last
and
my
teacher
complimented
me
enthusiastically
upon
my
and
thin
my
aversion
for
him
suddenly
thawed
out
two
of
my
classmates
were
a
grizzly
man
and
his
son
both
trying
to
learn
english
after
a
long
work
on
one
occasion
when
it
was
the
boy
turn
to
read
and
he
said
bat
for
bath
the
teacher
bellowed
imperiously
stick
out
the
tip
of
your
tongue
this
way
the
boy
tried
and
failed
oh
you
have
the
brain
of
a
horse
his
father
said
impatiently
in
yiddish
let
me
try
mr
teacher
and
screwing
up
his
bewhiskered
old
face
he
yelled
and
then
he
shot
out
half
an
inch
of
thick
red
tongue
the
teacher
grinned
struggling
with
a
more
pronounced
manifestation
of
his
mirth
his
tongue
missed
the
train
i
jested
in
yiddish
one
of
the
other
pupils
translated
it
into
english
whereupon
bender
suppressed
laughter
broke
loose
and
i
warmed
to
him
still
more
election
day
was
drawing
near
the
streets
were
alive
with
the
banners
transparencies
window
portraits
of
rival
candidates
processions
fireworks
speeches
i
heard
scores
of
words
from
the
political
jargon
of
the
country
i
was
continually
asking
questions
inquiring
into
the
meaning
of
the
things
i
saw
or
heard
around
me
each
day
brought
me
new
experiences
fresh
impressions
keen
sensations
an
american
day
seemed
to
be
far
richer
in
substance
than
an
antomir
year
i
was
in
an
everlasting
flutter
i
seemed
to
be
panting
for
breath
for
the
sheer
speed
with
which
i
was
rushing
through
life
what
was
the
meaning
of
all
this
noise
and
excitement
everybody
i
spoke
to
said
it
was
all
humbug
people
were
making
jokes
at
the
expense
of
all
politicians
irrespective
of
parties
one
is
as
bad
as
the
other
i
heard
all
around
me
they
are
all
thieves
argentine
rachael
conception
of
politics
was
clearly
the
conception
of
respectable
people
as
well
rejoicing
of
the
law
is
one
of
our
great
autumn
holidays
it
is
a
day
of
picturesque
merrymaking
and
ceremony
when
the
stringent
rule
barring
women
out
of
a
synagogue
is
relaxed
on
that
day
which
was
a
short
time
before
election
day
i
saw
an
east
side
judge
a
gentile
at
the
synagogue
of
the
sons
of
antomir
he
was
very
short
and
the
high
hat
he
wore
gave
him
droll
dignity
he
went
around
the
house
of
worship
kissing
babies
in
their
mothers
arms
and
saying
pleasant
things
to
the
worshipers
every
little
while
he
would
instinctively
raise
his
hand
to
his
high
hat
and
then
reminding
himself
that
one
did
not
bare
one
head
in
a
synagogue
he
would
feverishly
drop
his
hand
again
this
part
of
the
scene
was
so
utterly
so
strikingly
that
i
watched
it
a
great
friend
of
the
jewish
people
is
he
the
worshiper
who
stood
next
to
me
remarked
archly
he
is
simply
in
love
with
us
i
chimed
in
with
a
laugh
by
way
of
showing
off
my
understanding
of
things
american
it
jewish
votes
he
is
after
still
he
not
a
bad
fellow
the
man
by
my
side
remarked
if
you
have
a
trial
in
his
court
he
decide
it
in
your
favor
how
is
that
i
asked
perplexed
and
how
about
the
other
fellow
he
ca
decide
in
favor
of
both
can
he
there
is
no
in
america
the
man
by
my
side
returned
with
a
sage
smile
i
pondered
the
riddle
until
i
saw
light
i
know
what
you
mean
i
said
he
does
favors
only
to
those
who
vote
for
his
party
you
have
hit
it
upon
my
word
you
certainly
no
longer
a
green
one
voting
alone
may
not
be
enough
though
another
worshiper
interposed
if
you
ever
happen
to
have
a
case
in
his
court
take
a
lawyer
who
is
close
to
the
judge
understand
all
such
talks
notwithstanding
the
campaign
or
the
spectacular
novelty
of
it
thrilled
me
bender
delivered
a
speech
to
our
class
but
all
i
could
make
of
it
was
that
it
dealt
with
elections
in
general
and
that
it
was
something
solemn
and
lofty
like
a
prayer
or
a
psalm
election
day
came
round
i
did
not
rest
i
was
continually
snooping
around
watching
the
politicians
and
their
customers
as
we
called
the
voters
traffic
in
votes
was
quite
an
open
business
in
those
days
and
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
it
on
a
in
the
vicinity
ot
a
certain
or
even
in
front
of
the
itself
under
the
very
eyes
of
policemen
i
saw
the
bargaining
the
haggling
between
buyer
and
seller
i
saw
money
passed
from
the
one
to
the
other
i
saw
a
heeler
put
a
ballot
into
the
hand
of
a
man
whose
vote
he
had
just
purchased
the
present
system
of
voting
had
not
yet
been
introduced
and
then
march
him
into
a
to
make
sure
that
he
deposited
the
ballot
for
which
he
had
paid
him
i
saw
a
man
beaten
black
and
blue
because
he
had
cheated
the
party
that
had
paid
him
for
his
vote
i
saw
leary
blazing
and
all
he
was
a
man
with
rather
pleasing
features
i
saw
him
listening
to
a
whispered
report
from
one
of
the
men
whom
i
had
seen
buying
votes
there
was
no
such
thing
as
political
life
in
the
russia
of
that
period
the
only
political
parties
in
existence
there
were
the
secret
organizations
of
revolutionists
of
people
for
whom
government
detectives
were
incessantly
searching
so
that
they
might
be
hanged
or
sent
to
siberia
as
a
consequence
a
great
many
of
our
immigrants
landed
in
america
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
meaning
of
citizenship
and
the
first
practical
instructors
on
the
subject
into
whose
hands
they
fell
were
men
like
leary
or
his
political
underlings
these
taught
them
that
a
vote
was
something
to
be
sold
for
two
or
three
dollars
with
the
prospect
of
future
favors
into
the
bargain
and
that
a
politician
was
a
specialist
in
doing
people
favors
favors
favors
favors
i
heard
the
word
so
often
in
connection
with
politics
that
the
two
words
became
inseparable
in
my
mind
a
politician
was
a
master
of
favors
as
my
native
tongue
would
have
it
i
attended
school
with
religious
devotion
this
and
the
rapid
progress
i
was
making
endeared
me
to
bender
and
he
gave
me
special
attention
he
taught
me
grammar
which
i
relished
most
keenly
the
prospect
of
going
to
school
in
the
evening
would
loom
before
me
during
the
hours
of
boredom
or
distress
i
spent
at
my
cart
as
a
promise
of
divine
pleasure
some
english
words
inspired
me
with
hatred
as
though
they
were
obnoxious
living
things
the
disagreeable
impression
they
produced
on
me
was
so
strong
that
it
made
them
easy
to
memorize
so
that
i
welcomed
them
in
spite
of
my
aversion
or
rather
because
of
it
the
list
of
these
words
included
satisfaction
think
and
because
at
the
end
of
the
first
month
i
knew
infinitely
more
english
than
i
did
russian
one
evening
i
asked
bender
to
tell
me
the
real
difference
between
i
wrote
and
i
have
written
he
had
explained
it
to
me
once
or
twice
before
but
i
was
none
the
wiser
for
it
what
do
you
mean
by
difference
he
demanded
i
have
told
you
have
i
that
wrote
is
the
perfect
tense
while
have
written
is
the
imperfect
tense
this
was
in
accordance
with
the
grammatical
terminology
of
those
days
i
know
i
replied
in
my
wretched
english
but
what
is
the
difference
between
these
two
tenses
that
just
what
bothers
me
well
he
said
grandly
the
perfect
refers
to
what
was
while
the
imperfect
means
something
that
has
been
but
when
do
you
say
and
when
do
you
say
been
just
the
question
you
a
nuisance
levinsky
was
his
final
retort
i
was
tempted
to
say
and
you
are
a
blockhead
but
i
did
not
of
course
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
had
a
conviction
that
one
who
had
not
studied
the
talmud
could
not
be
anything
but
a
blockhead
the
first
thing
he
did
the
next
evening
was
to
take
up
the
same
subject
with
me
the
rest
of
the
class
watching
the
two
of
us
curiously
i
could
see
that
his
performance
of
the
previous
night
had
been
troubling
him
and
that
he
was
bent
upon
making
a
better
showing
he
spent
the
entire
lesson
of
two
hours
with
me
exclusively
trying
all
sorts
of
elucidations
and
illustrations
all
without
avail
the
trouble
with
him
was
that
he
pictured
the
working
of
a
foreigner
mind
with
regard
to
english
as
that
of
his
own
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
people
born
to
speak
another
language
were
guided
by
another
language
logic
so
to
say
and
that
in
order
to
reach
my
understanding
he
would
have
to
impart
his
ideas
in
terms
of
my
own
linguistic
psychology
still
one
of
his
numerous
examples
gave
me
a
glimmer
of
light
and
finally
it
all
became
clear
to
me
i
expressed
my
joy
so
boisterously
that
it
brought
a
roar
of
laughter
from
the
other
men
he
made
a
pet
of
me
i
became
the
monitor
of
his
class
that
is
i
would
bring
in
and
distribute
the
books
and
he
often
had
me
escort
him
home
so
as
to
talk
to
me
as
we
walked
he
was
extremely
companionable
and
loquacious
he
had
a
passion
for
sharing
with
others
whatever
knowledge
he
had
or
simply
for
hearing
himself
speak
upon
reaching
the
house
in
which
he
lived
we
would
pause
in
front
of
the
building
for
an
hour
or
even
more
or
else
we
would
start
on
a
ramble
usually
through
grand
street
to
east
river
and
back
again
through
east
broadway
his
favorite
topics
during
these
walks
were
civics
american
history
and
his
own
history
tenacity
he
would
drawl
out
with
nasal
dignity
get
these
three
words
engraved
on
your
mind
levinsky
diligence
perseverance
tenacity
and
by
way
of
illustration
he
would
enlarge
on
how
he
had
fought
his
way
through
city
college
how
he
had
won
some
prizes
and
beaten
a
rival
in
a
race
for
the
presidency
of
a
literary
society
how
he
had
obtained
his
present
two
occupations
as
clerk
during
the
day
and
as
in
the
winter
evenings
and
how
he
was
going
to
work
himself
up
to
something
far
more
dignified
and
lucrative
he
unbosomed
himself
to
me
of
all
his
plans
he
confided
some
of
his
intimate
secrets
in
me
often
dwelling
on
my
young
lady
who
was
a
first
cousin
of
his
and
to
whom
he
had
practically
been
engaged
since
boyhood
all
this
his
boasts
not
excepted
were
of
incalculable
profit
to
me
it
introduced
me
to
detail
after
detail
of
american
life
it
accelerated
the
process
of
getting
me
out
of
my
greenhornhood
in
the
better
sense
of
the
phrase
bender
was
an
ardent
patriot
he
was
sincerely
proud
of
his
country
he
was
firmly
convinced
that
it
was
superior
to
any
other
country
absolutely
in
every
respect
one
evening
in
the
course
of
one
of
those
rambles
of
ours
he
took
up
the
subject
of
political
parties
with
me
he
explained
the
respective
principles
of
the
republicans
and
the
democrats
being
a
democrat
himself
he
eulogized
his
own
organization
and
assailed
its
rival
but
he
did
it
strictly
along
the
lines
of
principle
and
policy
the
principles
of
a
party
are
its
soul
he
thundered
probably
borrowing
the
phrase
from
some
newspaper
and
he
proceeded
to
show
that
the
democratic
soul
was
of
superior
quality
he
went
into
the
question
of
state
rights
of
personal
liberty
of
jeffersonian
ideals
it
was
all
an
abstract
formula
and
i
was
so
overwhelmed
by
the
image
of
a
great
organization
fighting
for
lofty
ideals
that
the
concrete
question
of
political
of
leary
power
and
of
the
scenes
i
had
witnessed
on
election
day
escaped
me
at
the
moment
i
merely
felt
that
all
i
had
heard
about
politics
and
political
parties
from
argentine
rachael
and
from
other
people
was
the
product
of
untutored
brains
that
looked
at
things
from
the
special
viewpoint
of
the
gutter
presently
however
the
screaming
discrepancy
between
leary
rule
and
jeffersonian
ideals
did
occur
to
me
i
conveyed
my
thoughts
to
bender
as
well
as
i
could
he
flared
up
nonsense
he
said
leary
is
the
best
man
in
the
city
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
am
proud
of
it
ask
him
for
any
favor
and
he
will
do
it
for
you
if
he
has
to
get
out
of
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
spends
a
fortune
on
the
poor
he
has
the
biggest
heart
of
any
man
in
all
new
york
i
do
care
who
he
is
he
helps
a
lot
of
people
out
of
trouble
but
he
ca
help
everybody
can
he
why
you
hear
so
many
bad
things
about
him
he
has
a
lot
of
enemies
but
i
love
him
just
for
the
enemies
he
has
made
people
say
he
collects
bribes
from
disreputable
women
i
ventured
to
urge
it
a
lie
it
all
rumors
he
shouted
testily
on
election
day
i
saw
a
man
who
was
buying
votes
whisper
to
him
whisper
to
him
whisper
to
him
well
is
that
all
the
evidence
you
have
got
against
leary
i
suppose
that
the
kind
of
evidence
you
have
about
the
buying
of
votes
too
i
am
afraid
you
do
quite
understand
what
you
see
levinsky
his
answers
were
far
from
convincing
i
was
wondering
what
interest
he
had
to
defend
leary
to
deny
things
that
everybody
saw
but
he
disarmed
me
by
the
force
of
his
irritation
bender
himself
was
a
clean
honest
fellow
in
his
peculiar
american
way
he
was
very
religious
and
i
knew
that
his
piety
was
not
a
mere
affectation
which
was
another
puzzle
to
me
for
all
the
educated
jews
of
my
birthplace
were
known
to
be
atheists
he
belonged
to
a
reformed
synagogue
where
he
conducted
a
bible
class
one
evening
he
expanded
on
the
beauty
of
the
english
translation
of
the
old
testament
he
told
me
it
was
the
best
english
to
be
found
in
all
literature
study
the
bible
levinsky
read
it
and
read
it
again
the
suggestion
took
my
fancy
for
i
could
read
the
english
bible
with
the
aid
of
the
original
hebrew
text
i
began
with
psalm
the
poem
that
had
thrilled
me
when
i
was
on
shipboard
i
read
the
english
version
of
it
before
bender
until
i
pronounced
the
words
correctly
i
thought
i
realized
their
music
i
got
the
chapter
by
heart
when
i
recited
it
before
bender
he
was
joyously
surprised
and
called
me
a
corker
what
is
a
corker
i
asked
beamingly
it
slang
for
great
fellow
with
which
he
burst
into
a
lecture
on
slang
i
often
sat
up
till
the
small
hours
studying
the
english
bible
i
had
many
a
quarrel
with
levinsky
over
the
kerosene
i
consumed
finally
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
pay
her
five
cents
for
every
night
i
sat
up
late
but
this
merely
changed
the
bone
of
contention
between
us
instead
of
quarreling
over
kerosene
we
would
quarrel
over
hours
over
the
question
whether
i
really
had
sat
up
late
or
not
to
this
day
whenever
i
happen
to
utter
certain
biblical
words
or
names
in
their
english
version
they
seem
to
smell
of
levinsky
lamp
chapter
v
evening
school
closed
in
april
the
final
session
was
of
a
festive
character
bender
excited
and
sentimental
distributed
some
presents
promise
me
that
you
will
read
this
glorious
book
from
beginning
to
end
levinsky
he
said
solemnly
as
he
handed
me
a
new
volume
of
dombey
and
son
and
a
small
dictionary
we
may
never
meet
again
so
you
will
have
something
to
remind
you
that
once
upon
a
time
you
had
a
teacher
whose
name
was
bender
and
who
tried
to
do
his
duty
i
wanted
to
thank
him
to
say
something
handsome
but
partly
because
i
was
overcome
by
his
gift
partly
because
i
was
at
a
loss
for
words
i
merely
kept
saying
sheepishly
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
that
volume
of
dickens
proved
to
be
the
ruin
of
my
business
and
caused
me
some
weeks
of
the
blackest
misery
i
had
ever
experienced
as
i
started
to
read
the
voluminous
book
i
found
it
an
extremely
difficult
task
it
seemed
as
though
it
was
written
in
a
language
other
than
the
one
i
had
been
studying
during
the
past
few
months
i
had
to
turn
to
the
dictionary
for
the
meaning
of
every
third
word
if
not
more
often
while
in
many
cases
several
words
in
succession
were
greek
to
me
some
words
could
not
be
found
in
my
little
dictionary
at
all
and
in
the
case
of
many
others
the
english
definitions
were
as
much
of
an
enigma
to
me
as
the
words
they
were
supposed
to
interpret
yet
i
was
making
headway
i
had
to
turn
to
the
dictionary
less
and
less
often
it
was
the
first
novel
i
had
ever
read
the
dramatic
interest
of
the
narrative
coupled
with
the
poetry
and
the
humor
with
which
it
is
so
richly
spiced
was
a
revelation
to
me
i
had
had
no
idea
that
gentiles
were
capable
of
anything
so
wonderful
in
the
line
of
to
all
of
which
should
be
added
my
upon
being
able
to
read
english
of
this
sort
a
state
of
mind
which
i
was
too
apt
to
mistake
for
my
raptures
over
dickens
it
seemed
to
me
that
people
who
were
born
to
speak
this
language
were
of
a
superior
race
i
was
literally
intoxicated
and
i
would
delay
going
to
business
from
hour
to
hour
the
upshot
was
that
i
became
so
badly
involved
in
debt
that
i
dared
not
appear
with
my
for
fear
of
scenes
from
my
creditors
moreover
i
scarcely
had
anything
to
sell
finally
i
disposed
of
what
little
stock
i
still
possessed
for
of
its
value
and
to
my
relief
as
well
as
to
my
despair
my
activities
as
a
peddler
came
to
an
end
i
went
on
reading
or
rather
studying
dombey
and
son
with
voluptuous
abandon
till
i
found
myself
literally
penniless
i
procured
a
job
with
a
man
who
sold
dill
pickles
to
jewish
grocers
from
his
description
of
my
duties
chiefly
as
his
bookkeeper
i
expected
that
they
would
leave
me
plenty
of
leisure
between
whiles
to
read
my
dickens
i
was
mistaken
my
first
attempt
to
open
the
book
during
business
hours
which
extended
from
in
the
morning
to
bedtime
was
suppressed
my
employer
who
had
the
complexion
of
a
dill
pickle
by
the
way
proved
to
be
a
severe
taskmaster
absurdly
exacting
and
so
niggardly
that
i
dared
not
take
a
pickle
for
my
lunch
i
left
him
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
obtaining
employment
in
a
prosperous
next
door
my
new
boss
was
a
kinder
and
pleasanter
man
but
then
the
malodorous
and
clamorous
chaos
of
his
place
literally
sickened
me
i
left
the
fishmonger
and
jumped
my
board
at
levinsky
to
go
to
a
new
jersey
farm
where
i
was
engaged
to
read
yiddish
novels
to
the
illiterate
wife
of
a
new
york
merchant
but
my
client
was
soon
driven
from
the
place
by
the
new
jersey
mosquitoes
and
i
returned
to
new
york
with
two
dollars
in
my
pocket
i
worked
as
assistant
in
a
hebrew
school
where
the
boys
mocked
my
english
and
challenged
me
to
have
an
american
fight
with
them
till
on
the
third
day
i
administered
a
sound
thrashing
to
one
of
them
and
lost
my
job
maximum
max
got
the
proprietor
of
one
of
the
in
which
he
did
his
instalment
business
to
let
me
sleep
in
his
basement
in
return
for
some
odd
jobs
while
there
i
earned
from
two
to
three
dollars
a
week
in
tips
and
a
good
supper
every
time
there
was
a
wedding
in
the
place
which
happened
two
or
three
times
a
week
i
had
plenty
of
time
for
dickens
i
was
still
burrowing
my
way
through
dombey
and
son
while
the
affairs
of
the
hall
weddings
banquets
balls
mass
meetings
were
quite
exciting
i
felt
happy
but
this
happiness
of
mine
did
not
last
long
i
was
soon
sent
packing
this
is
the
way
it
came
about
it
was
in
the
large
ballroom
of
the
establishment
in
question
that
i
saw
a
modern
dance
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
it
produced
a
bewitching
effect
on
me
here
were
highly
respectable
young
women
who
would
let
men
encircle
their
waists
each
resting
her
arm
on
her
partner
shoulder
and
then
go
spinning
and
hopping
with
him
with
a
frank
relish
of
the
physical
excitement
in
which
they
were
joined
as
i
watched
one
of
these
girls
i
seemed
to
see
her
surrender
much
of
her
womanly
reserve
i
knew
that
the
dance
an
ordinary
waltz
was
considered
highly
proper
yet
her
pose
and
his
struck
me
as
a
public
confession
of
unseemly
mutual
interest
i
almost
blushed
for
her
and
for
the
moment
i
was
in
love
with
her
as
this
young
woman
went
round
and
round
her
face
bore
a
faint
smile
of
embarrassed
satisfaction
i
knew
that
it
was
a
sex
smile
another
woman
danced
with
grave
mien
and
i
knew
that
it
was
the
gravity
of
sex
to
watch
dancing
couples
became
a
passion
with
me
one
evening
as
i
stood
watching
the
waltzing
members
of
a
wedding
party
a
married
sister
of
the
bride
shouted
to
me
in
yiddish
what
are
you
doing
here
get
out
you
a
this
was
her
way
of
alluding
to
my
unpresentable
appearance
when
the
proprietor
heard
of
the
incident
he
sent
for
me
he
told
me
that
i
was
a
nuisance
and
bade
me
find
another
for
myself
the
following
month
or
two
constitute
the
most
wretched
period
of
my
life
in
america
i
slept
in
the
cheapest
on
the
bowery
and
not
infrequently
in
some
i
was
constantly
borrowing
quarters
dimes
nickels
maximum
max
was
very
kind
to
me
as
i
could
not
meet
him
at
the
stores
where
i
dared
not
face
my
creditors
i
would
waylay
him
in
front
of
his
residence
i
tell
you
what
levinsky
he
once
said
to
me
you
ought
to
learn
some
trade
it
plain
you
were
not
born
to
be
a
business
man
the
black
dots
meaning
the
words
in
books
take
up
too
much
room
in
your
head
finally
i
owed
him
so
many
quarters
and
even
that
i
had
not
the
courage
to
ask
him
for
more
hunger
was
a
frequent
experience
i
had
been
no
stranger
to
the
sensation
at
antomir
at
least
after
the
death
of
my
mother
but
for
some
reason
i
was
now
less
capable
of
bearing
it
the
pangs
i
underwent
were
at
times
so
acute
that
i
would
pick
up
cigarette
stubs
in
the
street
and
smoke
them
without
being
a
smoker
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
pain
supplanted
by
dizziness
and
nausea
sometimes
too
i
would
burn
my
hand
with
a
match
or
bite
it
as
hard
as
i
could
any
kind
of
suffering
or
excitement
was
welcome
provided
it
made
me
forget
my
hunger
when
famished
i
would
sometimes
saunter
through
the
streets
on
the
lower
east
side
which
disreputable
creatures
used
as
their
it
was
mildly
exciting
to
watch
women
hunt
for
men
and
men
hunt
for
women
their
furtive
glances
winks
tacit
understandings
bargainings
the
little
subterfuges
by
which
they
sought
to
veil
their
purpose
from
the
other
the
way
a
man
would
take
stock
of
a
passing
woman
to
ascertain
whether
she
was
of
the
approachable
class
the
timidity
of
some
of
the
men
and
the
ease
of
others
the
mutual
spying
of
two
or
three
rivals
aiming
at
the
same
quarry
the
pretended
abstraction
of
the
policemen
and
a
hundred
and
one
other
details
of
the
traffic
many
a
time
i
joined
in
the
chase
without
having
a
cent
in
my
pocket
stop
to
discuss
terms
with
a
woman
in
front
of
some
window
display
or
around
a
corner
only
soon
to
turn
away
from
her
on
the
pretense
that
i
had
expected
to
be
taken
to
her
residence
while
she
proposed
going
to
some
hotel
thus
held
by
a
dull
dogged
fascination
i
would
tramp
around
sometimes
for
hours
until
feeling
on
the
verge
of
a
with
hunger
and
exhaustion
i
would
sit
down
on
the
front
steps
of
some
house
i
often
thought
of
mr
even
but
nothing
was
further
from
my
mind
than
to
let
him
see
me
in
my
present
plight
one
morning
i
met
him
face
to
face
on
the
bowery
but
he
evidently
failed
to
recognize
me
one
afternoon
i
called
on
argentine
rachael
look
here
rachace
i
said
in
a
studiously
voice
i
dead
broke
i
pay
you
in
a
day
or
two
her
face
fell
i
never
trust
never
she
said
shaking
her
head
mournfully
it
brings
bad
luck
anyhow
i
felt
like
sinking
into
the
ground
all
right
i
see
you
some
other
time
i
said
with
an
air
of
bravado
she
ran
after
me
wait
a
moment
what
your
hurry
by
way
of
warding
off
bad
luck
she
offered
to
lend
me
three
dollars
in
cash
out
of
which
i
could
pay
her
i
declined
her
offer
she
pleaded
and
expostulated
but
i
stood
firm
and
i
came
away
in
a
state
of
the
blackest
wretchedness
and
i
could
never
again
bring
myself
to
show
my
face
at
her
house
a
little
was
now
my
chief
resort
it
was
kept
by
a
man
whom
i
had
met
at
the
synagogue
of
the
sons
of
antomir
a
former
cantor
who
now
supplemented
his
income
from
the
store
by
doing
occasional
service
as
a
wedding
bard
the
musicians
singers
and
who
made
the
place
their
headquarters
had
begun
by
taking
an
interest
in
me
but
the
dimes
and
nickels
i
was
now
unceasingly
borrowing
of
them
had
turned
me
into
an
outcast
in
their
eyes
i
felt
it
keenly
i
would
sulk
around
the
store
anxious
to
leave
and
loitering
in
spite
of
myself
there
was
a
piano
in
the
store
upon
which
they
often
played
this
their
talks
of
music
and
their
venomous
gossip
had
an
irresistible
fascination
for
me
i
noticed
that
morbid
vanity
was
a
common
disease
among
them
some
of
them
would
frankly
and
boldly
sing
their
own
panegyrics
while
others
more
discreet
and
tactful
let
their
high
opinions
of
themselves
be
inferred
nor
could
they
conceal
the
grudges
they
bore
one
another
the
jealousies
with
which
they
were
eaten
up
i
thought
them
ludicrous
repugnant
and
yet
they
lured
me
i
felt
that
some
of
those
among
them
who
were
most
grotesque
and
revolting
in
their
selfishness
had
something
in
their
certain
interests
passions
emotions
visions
which
placed
them
above
the
common
herd
this
was
especially
true
of
a
spare
violinist
boyish
of
figure
and
of
manner
with
deep
dark
rings
under
his
insatiable
blue
eyes
he
called
himself
octavius
he
was
literally
consumed
by
the
blaze
of
his
own
conceit
and
envy
when
he
was
not
in
raptures
over
the
poetry
subtlety
or
depth
of
his
own
playing
or
compositions
he
would
give
way
to
paroxysms
of
malice
and
derision
at
the
expense
of
some
other
musician
from
his
east
side
rivals
all
the
way
up
to
sarasate
who
was
then
at
the
height
of
his
career
and
had
recently
played
in
new
york
wagner
was
his
god
yet
no
sooner
would
somebody
else
express
admiration
for
wagner
music
than
he
would
offer
to
show
that
all
the
good
things
in
the
works
of
the
famous
german
were
merely
so
many
paraphrased
plagiarisms
from
the
compositions
of
other
men
he
possessed
a
phenomenal
memory
he
seemed
to
remember
every
note
in
every
opera
symphony
oratorio
or
concerto
that
anybody
ever
mentioned
and
there
was
not
a
piece
of
music
by
a
celebrated
man
but
he
was
ready
to
prove
that
it
had
been
stolen
from
some
other
celebrated
man
his
invective
was
particularly
violent
when
he
spoke
of
those
jewish
immigrants
in
the
musical
profession
whose
success
had
extended
beyond
the
east
side
he
could
never
mention
without
a
jeer
or
some
coarse
epithet
the
name
of
a
madison
street
boy
a
violinist
who
was
then
attracting
attention
in
europe
and
who
was
booked
for
a
series
of
concerts
before
the
best
audiences
in
the
united
states
he
was
a
passionate
indeed
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
determine
which
afforded
him
more
pleasure
his
or
the
colorful
pungent
often
preposterous
language
in
which
they
were
clothed
i
am
writing
something
with
hot
tears
in
it
i
once
heard
him
brag
they
be
so
hot
they
scald
the
heart
of
every
one
who
hears
it
provided
he
has
a
heart
he
had
given
me
some
nickels
yet
his
boasts
would
fill
me
with
disgust
on
the
occasion
just
mentioned
i
was
so
irritated
with
my
poverty
and
with
the
whole
world
that
i
was
seized
with
an
irresistible
desire
to
taunt
him
as
he
continued
to
eulogize
his
forthcoming
masterpiece
i
threw
out
a
hebrew
quotation
let
others
praise
thee
but
not
thine
own
mouth
he
took
no
heed
of
my
thrust
but
since
then
he
never
looked
at
me
and
i
never
dared
ask
him
for
a
nickel
again
he
had
a
ferocious
temper
when
it
broke
loose
it
would
be
a
veritable
volcano
of
revolting
acrimony
his
thin
firm
opening
and
snapping
shut
in
a
peculiar
fashion
as
though
he
were
squirting
venom
all
over
the
floor
he
was
as
sensual
as
maximum
max
only
his
voluptuous
talks
of
women
were
far
more
offensive
in
form
but
then
his
lewd
drivel
was
apt
to
glitter
with
flashes
of
imagination
i
do
not
remember
ever
seeing
him
in
good
humor
book
vii
my
temple
chapter
i
one
friday
evening
in
september
i
stood
on
grand
street
with
my
eyes
raised
to
the
big
open
windows
of
a
on
the
second
floor
of
a
brick
building
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lively
thoroughfare
only
the
busts
of
the
dancers
could
be
seen
this
and
the
distance
that
divided
me
from
the
hall
enveloped
the
scene
in
mystery
as
the
couples
floated
by
as
though
borne
along
on
waves
of
the
music
the
girls
clinging
to
the
men
their
fantastic
figures
held
me
spellbound
several
other
people
were
watching
the
dancers
from
the
street
mostly
women
who
gazed
at
the
appearing
and
disappearing
images
with
envying
eyes
presently
i
was
accosted
by
a
young
man
who
rushed
at
me
with
an
exuberant
how
are
you
in
english
he
was
dressed
in
the
height
of
the
summer
fashion
he
looked
familiar
to
me
but
i
was
at
a
loss
to
locate
him
do
you
know
me
try
to
remember
it
was
gitelson
my
on
board
the
ship
that
had
brought
me
to
america
the
tailor
who
clung
to
my
side
when
i
made
my
entry
into
the
new
world
sixteen
months
before
the
change
took
my
breath
away
you
did
recognize
me
did
you
he
said
with
a
triumphant
snicker
pulling
out
his
cuffs
so
as
to
flaunt
their
gold
or
gilded
buttons
he
asked
me
what
i
was
doing
but
he
was
more
interested
in
telling
me
about
himself
that
who
picked
him
up
near
castle
garden
had
turned
out
to
be
a
skinflint
and
a
he
had
started
him
on
five
dollars
a
week
for
work
the
market
price
of
which
was
twenty
or
thirty
so
gitelson
left
him
as
soon
as
he
realized
his
real
worth
and
he
had
been
making
good
wages
ever
since
being
an
excellent
tailor
he
was
much
sought
after
and
although
the
trade
had
two
long
slack
seasons
he
always
had
plenty
to
do
he
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
that
across
the
street
which
greatly
enhanced
his
importance
in
my
eyes
and
seemed
to
give
reality
to
the
floating
phantoms
that
i
had
been
watching
in
those
windows
he
said
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
go
up
there
as
he
had
an
appointment
with
a
lady
this
in
english
yet
he
went
on
describing
the
picnics
balls
excursions
he
attended
thereupon
i
involuntarily
shot
a
look
at
his
jaunty
straw
hat
thinking
of
his
gray
forelock
i
did
so
several
times
i
could
not
help
it
finally
my
furtive
glances
attracted
his
attention
what
are
you
looking
at
anything
wrong
with
my
hat
he
asked
baring
his
head
his
hair
was
freshly
trimmed
and
dudishly
dressed
as
i
looked
at
the
patch
of
silver
hair
that
shone
in
front
of
a
glossy
expanse
of
brown
he
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
oh
you
mean
that
that
nothing
the
ladies
like
me
all
the
same
he
went
on
boasting
but
he
did
it
in
an
inoffensive
way
he
simply
could
not
get
over
the
magic
transformation
that
had
come
over
him
while
in
his
native
place
his
income
had
amounted
to
four
rubles
about
two
dollars
a
week
his
wages
here
were
now
from
thirty
to
forty
dollars
he
felt
like
a
peasant
suddenly
turned
to
a
prince
but
he
spoke
of
his
successes
in
a
pleasing
soft
voice
and
with
a
kindly
confiding
smile
that
won
my
heart
altogether
he
made
the
impression
of
an
exceedingly
unaggressive
fellow
without
anything
like
ginger
in
his
after
he
had
bragged
his
fill
he
invited
me
to
have
a
glass
of
soda
with
him
there
was
a
on
the
next
corner
and
when
we
reached
it
i
paused
but
he
pulled
me
away
come
on
he
said
disdainfully
we
go
into
a
or
better
still
let
go
to
an
parlor
this
i
hesitated
to
do
because
of
my
shabby
clothes
when
he
divined
the
cause
of
my
embarrassment
he
was
touched
come
on
he
said
with
warm
hospitality
uttering
the
two
words
in
english
when
i
say
on
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
but
your
lady
is
waiting
for
you
she
can
wait
ladies
are
never
on
time
anyhow
but
maybe
she
is
if
she
is
she
can
dance
with
some
of
the
other
fellows
i
be
jealous
there
are
plenty
of
other
ladies
i
should
not
take
fifty
ladies
for
this
chance
of
seeing
you
honest
he
took
me
into
a
little
dazzlingly
lighted
and
mirrored
and
filled
with
tables
we
seated
ourselves
and
he
gave
the
order
he
did
so
rather
swaggeringly
but
his
manner
to
me
was
one
of
affectionate
and
compassionate
respectfulness
oh
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
he
said
you
remember
the
ship
as
if
one
could
ever
forget
things
of
that
kind
i
have
often
thought
of
you
wonder
what
has
become
of
him
i
said
to
myself
he
did
not
remember
my
name
or
perhaps
he
had
never
known
it
so
i
had
to
introduce
myself
afresh
the
contrast
between
his
flashy
clothes
and
my
frowsy
appearance
as
i
saw
ourselves
in
the
mirrors
on
either
side
of
me
made
me
sorely
ill
at
ease
the
brilliancy
of
the
gaslight
chafed
my
nerves
it
was
as
though
it
had
been
turned
on
for
the
express
purpose
of
illuminating
my
disgrace
i
was
longing
to
go
away
but
gitelson
fell
to
questioning
me
about
my
affairs
once
more
and
this
time
he
did
so
with
such
unfeigned
concern
that
i
told
him
the
whole
cheerless
story
of
my
sixteen
months
life
in
america
he
was
touched
in
his
mild
unemphatic
way
he
expressed
heartfelt
sympathy
but
why
do
you
learn
some
trade
he
inquired
you
seem
to
be
fit
for
business
anyhow
the
last
two
words
in
mispronounced
english
everybody
is
telling
me
that
there
you
are
you
just
listen
to
me
levinsky
you
wo
be
sorry
for
it
he
proposed
in
a
which
paid
even
better
than
tailoring
and
was
far
easier
to
learn
finally
he
offered
to
introduce
me
to
an
operator
who
would
teach
me
the
trade
and
to
pay
him
my
tuition
fee
he
went
into
details
he
continued
to
address
me
as
levinsky
and
tried
to
show
me
esteem
as
his
intellectual
superior
but
in
spite
of
himself
as
it
were
he
gradually
took
a
respectfully
contemptuous
tone
with
me
do
be
a
lobster
mr
levinsky
lobster
he
said
in
english
this
is
not
russia
here
a
fellow
must
be
no
fool
there
is
no
sense
in
living
the
way
you
do
do
as
gitelson
tells
you
and
live
decently
dress
decently
and
lay
by
a
dollar
or
two
there
are
lots
of
educated
fellows
in
the
shops
he
told
me
of
some
of
these
particularly
of
one
young
man
who
was
a
shopmate
of
his
he
never
comes
to
work
without
some
book
he
said
when
there
is
not
enough
to
do
he
reads
when
he
has
to
wait
for
a
new
as
we
call
it
he
reads
other
fellows
carry
on
but
he
is
always
reading
he
is
so
highly
educated
he
could
read
any
kind
of
book
and
i
do
believe
there
is
a
book
in
the
world
that
he
has
not
read
he
is
saving
up
money
to
go
to
college
on
parting
he
became
fully
respectful
again
do
as
i
tell
you
levinsky
he
said
take
up
he
made
me
write
down
his
address
he
expected
that
i
would
do
it
in
yiddish
when
he
saw
me
write
his
name
and
the
name
of
the
street
in
english
he
said
reverently
writing
english
already
there
is
a
mind
for
you
if
i
could
write
like
that
i
could
become
a
designer
well
do
lose
the
address
call
on
me
and
if
you
make
up
your
mind
to
take
up
just
say
the
word
and
i
fix
you
up
when
gitelson
says
he
will
he
will
the
image
of
that
reading
books
and
laying
by
money
for
a
college
education
haunted
me
why
could
i
not
do
the
same
i
pictured
myself
working
and
studying
and
saving
money
for
the
kind
of
education
which
matilda
had
dinned
into
my
ears
i
accepted
gitelson
offer
or
the
cloak
business
as
a
career
never
entered
my
dreams
at
that
time
i
regarded
the
trade
merely
as
a
to
a
life
of
intellectual
interests
chapter
ii
the
operator
to
whom
gitelson
apprenticed
me
was
a
short
plump
fellow
named
joe
i
have
but
a
dim
recollection
of
his
features
though
i
distinctly
remember
his
irresistible
smile
and
his
emotional
nature
he
taught
me
to
bind
seams
and
later
to
put
in
pockets
to
stitch
on
under
collars
and
so
forth
after
a
while
he
began
to
pay
me
a
small
weekly
wage
he
himself
being
paid
for
our
joint
work
by
the
piece
the
shop
was
not
the
manufacturer
it
belonged
to
one
of
his
contractors
who
received
from
him
bundles
of
material
which
his
employees
tailors
machine
operators
pressers
and
finisher
girls
made
up
into
cloaks
or
jackets
the
cheaper
goods
were
made
entirely
by
operators
the
better
grades
partly
by
tailors
partly
by
operators
or
wholly
by
tailors
but
these
were
mostly
made
inside
in
the
manufacturer
own
establishment
the
designing
cutting
and
making
of
samples
were
inside
branches
exclusively
gitelson
as
a
skilled
tailor
was
an
inside
man
being
mostly
employed
on
samples
my
work
proved
to
be
much
harder
and
the
hours
very
much
longer
than
i
had
anticipated
i
had
to
toil
from
six
in
the
morning
to
nine
in
the
evening
joe
put
in
even
more
time
i
always
found
him
grinding
away
rapturously
when
i
came
to
the
shop
in
the
morning
and
always
left
him
toiling
as
rapturously
when
i
went
home
in
the
evening
ours
is
a
seasonal
trade
all
the
work
of
the
year
is
crowded
into
two
short
seasons
of
three
and
two
months
respectively
during
which
one
is
to
earn
enough
to
last
him
twelve
months
only
tailors
like
gitelson
were
kept
busy
throughout
the
year
but
then
wages
were
comparatively
high
so
that
a
good
mechanic
particularly
an
operator
could
make
as
much
as
dollars
a
week
working
about
fifteen
hours
a
day
however
during
the
first
two
or
three
weeks
i
was
too
much
borne
down
by
the
cruelty
of
my
drudgery
to
be
interested
in
the
luring
rewards
which
it
held
out
not
being
accustomed
to
physical
exertion
of
any
kind
i
felt
like
an
innocent
man
suddenly
thrown
into
prison
and
put
at
hard
labor
i
was
shocked
i
was
crushed
i
was
continually
looking
at
the
clock
counting
the
minutes
and
when
i
came
home
i
would
feel
so
sore
in
body
and
spirit
that
i
could
not
sleep
studying
or
reading
was
out
of
the
question
moreover
as
a
peddler
i
seemed
to
have
belonged
to
the
world
of
business
to
the
same
class
as
the
rich
the
refined
while
now
behold
i
was
a
workman
a
laborer
one
of
the
masses
i
pitied
myself
for
a
degraded
wretch
and
when
some
of
my
shopmates
indulged
in
coarse
pleasantry
in
the
hearing
of
the
finisher
girls
it
would
hurt
me
personally
as
a
confirmation
of
my
disgrace
and
this
is
the
kind
of
people
with
whom
i
am
doomed
to
associate
i
would
lament
in
point
of
fact
there
were
only
four
or
five
fellows
of
this
kind
in
a
shop
of
fifty
nor
were
some
of
the
peddlers
or
i
had
known
more
modest
of
speech
than
the
worst
of
these
what
was
more
i
felt
that
some
of
my
were
purer
and
better
men
than
i
but
that
did
not
matter
i
abhorred
the
shop
and
everybody
in
it
as
a
convict
abhors
his
jail
and
his
when
the
men
quarreled
they
would
call
one
another
among
other
things
this
meant
that
they
accused
one
another
of
being
ever
hungry
for
bundles
of
raw
material
ever
eager
to
gobble
up
all
the
work
in
the
shop
i
wondered
how
one
could
be
anxious
for
physical
toil
they
seemed
to
be
a
lot
of
savages
the
idea
of
leaving
the
shop
often
crossed
my
mind
but
i
never
had
the
courage
to
take
it
seriously
i
had
tried
my
hand
at
peddling
and
failed
was
i
a
failure
as
a
mechanic
as
well
was
i
unfit
for
anything
the
other
fellows
at
the
shop
had
a
definite
foothold
in
life
while
i
was
a
waif
a
nearly
two
years
in
america
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
thoughts
such
as
these
had
a
cowing
effect
on
me
they
made
me
feel
somewhat
like
the
fresh
prisoner
who
has
been
put
to
work
at
to
have
his
wild
spirit
broken
i
dared
not
give
up
my
new
occupation
i
would
force
myself
to
work
hard
and
as
i
did
so
the
very
terrors
of
my
toil
would
fascinate
me
giving
me
a
sense
of
my
own
worth
as
the
jackets
that
bore
my
stitches
kept
piling
up
the
concrete
result
of
my
useful
performance
would
become
a
source
of
moral
satisfaction
to
me
and
when
i
received
my
first
wages
the
first
money
i
had
ever
earned
by
the
work
of
my
hands
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
the
first
money
i
had
ever
earned
honestly
by
little
and
little
i
got
used
to
my
work
and
even
to
enjoy
its
processes
moreover
the
thinking
and
the
dreaming
i
usually
indulged
in
while
plying
my
machine
became
a
great
pleasure
to
me
it
seemed
as
though
one
mind
could
not
produce
such
interesting
thoughts
or
images
unless
it
had
the
rhythmic
whir
of
a
to
stimulate
it
i
now
ate
well
and
slept
well
i
was
in
the
best
of
health
and
in
the
best
of
spirits
i
was
in
an
uplifted
state
of
mind
no
one
seemed
to
be
honorable
who
did
not
earn
his
bread
in
the
sweat
of
his
brow
as
i
did
had
i
then
chanced
to
hear
a
socialist
speech
i
might
have
become
an
ardent
follower
of
karl
marx
and
my
life
might
have
been
directed
along
lines
other
than
those
which
brought
me
to
financial
power
the
girls
in
the
shop
individually
scarcely
interested
me
but
their
collective
presence
was
something
of
which
i
never
seemed
to
be
quite
unconscious
it
was
as
though
the
workaday
atmosphere
were
scented
with
the
breath
of
a
delicate
perfume
a
perfume
that
was
tainted
with
the
tang
of
my
yearning
for
matilda
two
girls
who
were
seated
within
a
yard
from
my
machine
were
continually
bandying
secrets
now
one
and
then
the
other
would
look
around
to
make
sure
that
the
contractor
was
not
watching
and
then
she
would
bend
over
and
whisper
something
into
her
chum
ear
this
would
set
my
blood
tingling
with
a
peculiar
kind
of
inquisitiveness
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
that
their
whispered
conferences
mostly
bore
upon
such
innocent
matters
as
their
work
earnings
lodgings
or
dresses
nevertheless
it
seemed
to
me
that
their
whispers
especially
when
accompanied
by
a
smile
a
giggle
or
a
wink
conveyed
some
of
their
intimate
thoughts
of
men
they
were
homely
girls
with
pinched
faces
yet
at
such
moments
they
represented
to
me
all
that
there
was
fascinating
and
disquieting
in
womanhood
the
jests
of
the
rowdies
would
make
me
writhe
with
disgust
as
a
rule
they
were
ostensibly
addressed
to
some
of
the
other
fellows
or
to
nobody
in
particular
their
real
target
being
the
nearest
girls
these
would
receive
them
with
gestures
of
protest
or
with
an
exclamation
of
mild
repugnance
or
in
the
majority
of
cases
pass
them
unnoticed
as
one
does
some
unavoidable
discomfort
of
toil
there
was
only
one
girl
in
the
shop
who
received
these
jests
with
a
shamefaced
grin
or
even
with
frank
appreciation
and
she
was
a
perfectly
respectable
girl
like
the
rest
there
were
some
finisher
girls
who
could
not
boast
an
unsullied
reputation
but
none
of
them
worked
in
our
shop
and
indeed
their
number
in
the
entire
trade
was
very
small
one
of
the
two
girls
who
sat
nearest
to
my
machine
was
quite
popular
in
the
shop
but
that
was
because
of
her
sweet
disposition
and
sound
sense
rather
than
for
her
looks
she
was
known
to
have
a
snug
little
account
in
a
it
was
for
a
marriage
portion
she
was
saving
but
she
was
doing
it
so
strenuously
that
she
stinted
herself
the
expense
of
a
decent
dress
or
hat
or
the
price
of
a
ticket
to
a
ball
picnic
or
the
result
was
that
while
she
was
pinching
and
scrimping
herself
to
pave
the
way
to
her
marriage
she
barred
herself
by
this
very
process
from
contact
with
possible
suitors
she
was
a
good
soul
from
time
to
time
she
would
give
some
of
her
money
to
a
needy
relative
and
then
she
would
try
to
make
up
for
it
by
saving
with
more
ardor
than
ever
her
name
was
gussie
joe
the
plump
dark
fellow
who
was
teaching
me
the
trade
was
one
of
the
several
men
in
the
shop
who
were
addicted
to
salacious
banter
one
of
his
favorite
pranks
was
to
burlesque
some
synagogue
chant
from
the
solemn
service
of
the
days
of
awe
with
disgustingly
coarse
yiddish
in
place
of
the
hebrew
of
the
prayer
but
he
was
not
a
bad
fellow
by
any
means
he
was
extremely
impressionable
and
susceptible
of
good
influences
a
sad
tune
would
bring
a
woebegone
look
into
his
face
while
a
good
joke
would
make
him
laugh
to
tears
he
was
fond
of
referring
to
himself
as
my
rabbi
which
is
hebrew
for
teacher
and
that
was
the
way
i
would
address
him
at
first
playfully
and
then
as
a
matter
of
course
one
day
after
he
had
delivered
himself
of
a
quip
that
set
my
teeth
on
edge
i
said
to
him
appealingly
why
should
you
be
saying
these
things
rabbi
if
you
do
like
them
you
can
stop
your
ears
he
fired
back
i
retorted
that
it
was
not
a
matter
of
piety
but
of
common
decency
and
my
words
were
evidently
striking
home
but
the
girls
applauded
me
which
spoiled
it
all
if
you
want
to
preach
sermons
you
in
the
wrong
place
he
flared
up
this
is
no
synagogue
nor
is
it
a
pigsty
gussie
urged
without
raising
her
eyes
from
her
work
a
month
or
two
later
he
abandoned
these
sallies
of
his
own
accord
the
other
fellows
twitted
him
on
his
burst
of
righteousness
and
made
efforts
to
lure
him
into
a
race
of
ribald
punning
but
he
stood
his
ground
by
and
by
it
leaked
out
that
he
was
engaged
and
madly
in
love
with
his
girl
i
warmed
to
him
the
young
woman
who
had
won
his
heart
was
not
an
employee
of
our
shop
indeed
between
and
who
are
employed
in
the
same
place
are
not
quite
so
common
as
one
might
suppose
the
factory
is
scarcely
a
proper
setting
for
romance
it
is
one
of
the
in
our
struggle
for
existence
where
we
treat
woman
as
an
inferior
being
whereas
in
civilized
we
prefer
to
keep
up
the
chivalrous
fiction
that
she
is
our
superior
the
girls
of
our
shop
disheveled
and
handled
with
anything
but
chivalry
aroused
my
sympathy
but
it
was
not
the
kind
of
feeling
that
stimulates
romantic
interest
still
collectively
as
an
abstract
reminder
of
their
sex
they
flavored
my
sordid
environment
with
poetry
chapter
iii
the
majority
of
the
students
at
the
college
of
the
city
of
new
york
was
already
made
up
of
jewish
boys
mostly
from
the
one
such
student
often
called
at
the
in
which
i
was
employed
and
in
which
his
father
a
fellow
with
a
sandy
beard
a
former
teamster
was
one
of
the
pressers
a
classmate
of
this
boy
was
supported
by
an
aunt
a
spinster
who
made
good
wages
as
a
in
a
to
make
an
educated
man
of
her
nephew
was
the
great
ambition
of
her
life
all
this
made
me
feel
as
though
i
were
bound
to
that
college
with
the
ties
of
kinship
two
of
my
other
shopmates
had
sons
at
high
school
the
east
side
was
full
of
poor
jews
peddlers
grocers
salesmen
insurance
agents
who
would
beggar
themselves
to
give
their
children
a
liberal
education
then
too
thousands
of
our
attended
public
evening
school
while
many
others
took
lessons
at
home
the
ghetto
rang
with
a
clamor
for
knowledge
to
save
up
some
money
and
prepare
for
college
seemed
to
be
the
most
natural
thing
for
me
to
do
i
said
to
myself
that
i
must
begin
to
study
for
it
without
delay
but
that
was
impossible
and
it
was
quite
some
time
before
i
took
up
the
course
which
the
boy
had
laid
out
for
me
during
the
first
three
months
i
literally
had
no
time
to
open
a
book
nor
was
that
all
my
work
as
a
had
become
a
passion
with
me
so
much
so
that
even
on
saturdays
when
the
shop
was
closed
i
would
scarcely
do
any
reading
instead
i
would
seek
the
society
of
other
with
whom
i
might
talk
shop
i
was
developing
speed
rather
than
skill
at
my
but
this
question
of
speed
afforded
exercise
to
my
brain
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
realize
that
the
number
of
cloaks
or
jackets
which
one
turned
out
in
a
given
length
of
time
was
largely
a
matter
of
method
and
system
i
perceived
that
joe
who
was
accounted
a
fast
hand
would
take
up
the
various
parts
of
a
garment
in
a
certain
order
calculated
to
reduce
to
a
minimum
the
amount
of
time
lost
in
passing
from
section
to
section
so
i
watched
him
intently
studying
his
system
with
every
fiber
of
my
being
nor
did
i
content
myself
with
imitating
his
processes
i
was
forever
pondering
the
problem
and
introducing
little
improvements
of
my
own
i
was
making
a
science
of
it
it
was
not
merely
physical
exertion
it
was
a
source
of
intellectual
interest
as
well
i
was
wrapped
up
in
it
if
i
happened
to
meet
a
who
was
noted
for
extraordinary
speed
i
would
feel
like
an
ambitious
musician
meeting
a
famous
virtuoso
some
were
artists
i
certainly
was
not
one
of
them
i
admired
their
work
and
envied
them
but
i
lacked
the
artistic
patience
and
the
dexterity
essential
to
workmanship
of
a
high
order
much
to
my
chagrin
i
was
a
born
bungler
but
then
i
possessed
physical
strength
nervous
vitality
method
and
inventiveness
all
the
elements
that
go
to
make
up
speed
i
was
progressing
with
unusual
rapidity
joe
criticized
my
work
severely
often
calling
me
botcher
but
i
knew
that
this
was
chiefly
intended
to
veil
his
satisfaction
at
the
growing
profits
that
my
work
was
yielding
him
i
now
earned
about
ten
dollars
a
week
of
which
i
spent
about
five
saving
the
rest
for
the
next
season
of
idleness
at
last
that
season
set
in
there
was
not
a
stroke
of
work
in
the
shop
i
was
so
absorbed
in
my
new
vocation
that
i
would
pass
my
evenings
in
a
haunt
a
café
on
delancey
street
where
i
never
tired
talking
sleeves
pockets
stitches
trimmings
and
the
like
there
was
a
good
deal
of
in
the
place
but
somehow
i
never
succumbed
to
that
temptation
but
then
under
the
influence
of
some
of
the
fellows
i
met
there
i
developed
a
considerable
passion
for
the
jewish
theater
these
young
men
were
what
is
known
on
the
east
side
as
patriots
that
is
devoted
admirers
of
some
actor
or
actress
and
members
of
his
or
her
voluntary
claque
several
of
the
other
frequenters
were
also
interested
in
the
stage
or
at
least
in
the
gossip
of
it
so
that
on
the
whole
there
was
as
much
talk
of
plays
and
players
as
there
was
of
cloaks
and
our
shop
discussions
certainly
never
reached
the
heat
that
usually
characterized
our
debates
on
things
theatrical
the
most
ardent
of
the
patriots
was
a
young
contractor
named
mindels
he
attended
nearly
every
performance
in
which
his
favorite
actor
had
a
part
selling
dozens
of
tickets
for
his
benefit
performances
and
usually
losing
considerable
sums
on
these
sales
loading
him
with
presents
and
often
running
his
errands
i
once
saw
mindels
in
a
violent
quarrel
with
a
man
who
had
scoffed
at
his
idol
mindels
younger
brother
jake
fascinated
me
by
his
appearance
and
we
became
great
chums
he
was
the
handsomest
fellow
i
ever
had
seen
with
a
fine
head
of
hair
classic
features
and
large
eyes
too
soft
and
too
blue
perhaps
his
was
a
manly
face
and
figure
and
his
voice
was
a
manly
a
beautiful
basso
but
this
masculine
exterior
contained
an
effeminate
psychology
in
my
heart
i
pronounced
him
a
calf
and
when
i
had
discovered
the
english
word
sissy
i
thought
that
it
just
fitted
him
yet
i
adored
him
and
even
looked
up
to
him
all
because
of
his
good
looks
he
was
a
talmudist
like
myself
and
we
had
much
in
common
also
regarding
our
dreams
of
the
future
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
have
met
you
i
once
said
to
him
i
am
glad
too
he
returned
flushing
i
found
that
he
blushed
rather
too
frequently
which
confirmed
my
notion
of
him
as
a
sissy
like
most
handsome
men
he
bestowed
a
great
deal
of
time
on
his
personal
appearance
he
never
uttered
a
foul
word
nor
a
harsh
one
if
he
heard
a
tell
an
indecent
story
he
would
look
down
smiling
and
blushing
like
a
girl
formerly
he
had
been
employed
in
his
brother
shop
while
now
he
earned
his
living
by
soliciting
and
collecting
for
a
company
chapter
iv
jake
mindels
was
a
devotee
of
madame
klesmer
the
leading
jewish
actress
of
that
period
which
by
the
way
was
practically
the
opening
chapter
in
the
interesting
history
of
the
yiddish
stage
in
america
madame
klesmer
was
a
tragedienne
and
a
prima
donna
at
usual
combination
in
those
days
one
friday
evening
we
were
in
the
gallery
of
her
theater
the
play
was
an
historical
opera
and
she
was
playing
the
part
of
a
biblical
princess
it
was
the
closing
scene
of
an
act
the
whole
company
was
on
the
stage
swaying
sidewise
and
singing
with
the
princess
her
head
in
a
halo
of
electric
light
in
the
center
jake
was
feasting
his
large
blue
eyes
on
her
presently
he
turned
to
me
with
the
air
of
one
confiding
a
secret
would
you
like
to
kiss
her
and
swinging
around
again
he
resumed
feasting
his
blue
eyes
on
the
princess
i
have
seen
prettier
women
than
she
i
replied
let
a
fellow
listen
she
is
a
dear
all
the
same
you
know
a
good
thing
when
you
see
it
levinsky
are
you
in
love
with
her
do
let
me
listen
when
the
curtain
fell
he
made
me
applaud
her
there
were
several
during
all
of
which
he
kept
applauding
her
furiously
shouting
the
prima
donna
name
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
winking
to
me
imploringly
to
do
the
same
when
quiet
had
been
restored
at
last
i
returned
to
the
subject
are
you
in
love
with
her
sure
he
answered
without
blushing
as
if
a
fellow
could
help
it
if
she
let
me
kiss
her
little
finger
i
should
be
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
and
if
she
let
you
kiss
her
cheek
i
should
go
crazy
and
if
she
let
you
kiss
her
lips
what
the
use
asking
idle
questions
would
you
like
to
kiss
her
neck
you
ask
me
foolish
questions
you
are
in
love
with
her
i
declared
reflectively
i
should
say
i
was
it
was
a
unique
sort
of
love
for
he
wanted
me
also
to
be
in
love
with
her
if
you
are
not
in
love
with
her
you
must
have
a
heart
of
iron
or
else
your
soul
is
dry
as
a
raisin
with
which
he
took
to
analyzing
the
prima
donna
charms
going
into
raptures
over
her
eyes
smile
gestures
manner
of
opening
her
mouth
and
her
swing
and
step
as
she
walked
over
the
stage
no
i
do
care
for
her
i
replied
you
are
a
peculiar
fellow
if
i
did
fall
in
love
i
said
by
way
of
meeting
him
halfway
i
should
choose
segalovitch
she
is
a
thousand
times
prettier
than
mrs
klesmer
tut
tut
segalovitch
was
certainly
prettier
than
the
prima
donna
but
she
played
unimportant
parts
so
the
notion
of
one
falling
in
love
with
her
seemed
queer
to
jake
that
night
i
had
an
endless
chain
of
dreams
in
every
one
of
which
madame
klesmer
was
the
central
figure
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
i
fell
in
love
with
her
and
was
overjoyed
when
i
saw
jake
mindels
at
dinner
i
said
to
him
with
the
air
of
one
bringing
glad
news
do
you
know
i
am
in
love
with
her
with
whom
with
mrs
segalovitch
oh
pshaw
i
had
forgotten
all
about
her
i
mean
madame
kiesmer
i
said
somehow
my
love
for
the
actress
did
not
interfere
with
my
longing
thoughts
of
matilda
i
asked
myself
no
questions
and
so
we
went
on
loving
jointly
jake
and
i
the
companionship
of
our
passion
apparently
stimulating
our
romance
as
companionship
at
a
meal
stimulates
the
appetite
of
the
diners
each
of
us
seemed
to
be
infatuated
with
madame
klesmer
yet
the
community
of
this
feeling
far
from
arousing
mutual
jealousy
in
us
seemed
to
strengthen
the
ties
of
our
friendship
we
would
hum
her
songs
in
duet
recite
her
lines
compare
notes
on
our
dreams
of
happiness
with
her
one
day
we
composed
a
to
her
a
long
epistle
full
of
biblical
and
homespun
poetry
which
we
copied
jointly
his
lines
alternating
with
mine
and
which
we
signed
your
two
lovelorn
slaves
whose
hearts
are
panting
for
a
look
of
your
eyes
jacob
and
david
we
mailed
the
letter
without
affixing
any
address
the
next
evening
we
were
in
the
theater
and
when
she
appeared
on
the
stage
and
shot
a
glance
to
the
gallery
jake
nudged
me
violently
but
she
does
not
know
we
are
in
the
gallery
i
argued
she
must
think
we
are
in
the
orchestra
hearts
are
good
guessers
guessers
nothing
let
listen
madame
klesmer
was
playing
the
part
of
a
girl
in
a
modern
russian
town
she
declaimed
her
lines
speaking
like
a
prophetess
in
ancient
israel
and
i
liked
it
extremely
i
was
fully
aware
that
it
was
unnatural
for
a
girl
in
a
modern
russian
town
to
speak
like
a
prophetess
in
ancient
israel
but
that
was
just
why
i
liked
it
i
thought
it
perfectly
proper
that
people
on
the
stage
should
not
talk
as
they
would
off
the
stage
i
thought
that
this
unnatural
speech
of
theirs
was
one
of
the
principal
things
an
audience
paid
for
the
only
actor
who
spoke
like
a
human
being
was
the
comedian
and
this
too
seemed
to
be
perfectly
proper
for
a
comedian
was
a
fellow
who
did
not
take
his
art
seriously
and
so
i
thought
that
this
natural
talk
of
his
was
part
of
his
i
thought
it
was
something
like
a
clown
burlesquing
the
old
testament
by
reading
it
not
in
the
ancient
intonations
of
the
synagogue
but
in
the
plain
conversational
accents
of
life
during
the
intermission
in
the
course
of
our
talk
about
madame
klesmer
jake
said
do
you
know
levinsky
i
do
think
you
really
love
her
i
love
her
as
much
as
you
and
more
too
i
retorted
how
much
do
you
love
her
would
you
walk
from
new
york
to
philadelphia
if
she
wanted
you
to
do
so
why
should
she
what
good
would
it
do
her
but
suppose
she
does
want
it
how
can
i
suppose
such
nonsense
well
she
might
just
want
to
see
how
much
you
love
her
a
nice
test
that
oh
well
she
might
just
get
that
kind
of
notion
women
are
liable
to
get
any
kind
of
notion
do
you
know
well
if
madame
klesmer
got
that
kind
of
notion
i
should
tell
her
to
walk
to
philadelphia
herself
then
you
do
love
her
i
love
her
as
much
as
you
do
but
if
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
make
a
fool
of
me
i
should
send
her
to
the
eighty
devils
he
winced
and
you
call
that
love
do
you
he
said
with
a
sneer
in
the
corner
of
his
pretty
mouth
as
for
me
i
should
walk
to
boston
if
she
wanted
me
to
even
if
she
did
not
promise
to
let
you
kiss
her
even
if
she
did
not
and
if
she
did
i
should
walk
to
chicago
and
if
she
promised
to
be
your
mistress
oh
what
the
use
talking
that
way
he
protested
blushing
are
you
shy
a
regular
i
declare
stop
he
said
coloring
once
again
it
dawned
upon
me
that
he
was
probably
chaste
and
searching
his
face
with
a
mocking
look
i
said
i
bet
you
you
are
still
innocent
leave
me
alone
please
he
retorted
softly
i
have
hit
it
then
i
importuned
him
with
a
great
sense
of
my
own
superiority
do
let
me
alone
will
you
i
just
want
you
to
tell
me
whether
you
are
innocent
or
not
it
none
of
your
business
of
course
you
are
and
if
i
am
is
it
a
disgrace
who
says
it
is
i
desisted
he
became
more
attractive
than
ever
to
me
nevertheless
i
made
repeated
attempts
to
deprave
him
his
chastity
bothered
me
the
idea
of
breaking
it
down
became
an
irresistible
temptation
i
would
ridicule
him
for
a
sissy
appeal
to
him
in
the
name
of
his
health
beg
him
as
one
does
for
a
personal
favor
all
in
vain
he
spoke
better
english
than
i
with
more
ease
and
in
that
pretty
basso
of
his
which
i
envied
he
had
never
read
dickens
or
any
other
english
author
but
he
was
familiar
with
some
subjects
to
which
i
was
a
stranger
he
was
well
grounded
in
arithmetic
knew
some
geography
and
now
with
a
view
of
qualifying
for
the
study
of
medicine
he
was
preparing
with
the
aid
of
a
private
teacher
for
the
regents
examination
in
algebra
geometry
english
composition
american
and
english
history
i
thought
he
did
not
study
deeply
enough
that
he
took
more
real
interest
in
his
collars
and
neckties
the
shine
of
his
shoes
or
the
hang
of
his
trousers
than
he
did
in
his
algebra
or
history
by
his
cleanliness
and
tidiness
he
reminded
me
of
naphtali
which
indeed
had
something
to
do
with
my
attachment
for
him
my
relations
toward
him
echoed
with
the
feelings
i
used
to
have
for
the
reticent
omniscient
boy
of
abner
court
and
with
the
hoarse
studious
young
talmudist
with
whom
i
would
famish
in
company
he
had
neither
naphtali
brains
nor
his
individuality
yet
i
looked
up
to
him
and
was
somewhat
under
his
influence
i
adopted
many
of
the
english
phrases
he
was
in
the
habit
of
using
and
tried
to
imitate
his
way
of
dressing
as
a
consequence
he
would
sometimes
assume
a
patronizing
tone
with
me
addressing
me
with
a
sneer
which
i
liked
in
spite
of
myself
we
made
a
compact
to
speak
nothing
but
english
and
to
a
considerable
extent
we
kept
it
chapter
v
a
few
weeks
of
employment
were
succeeded
by
another
period
of
enforced
idleness
i
took
up
arithmetic
but
reading
was
still
a
great
passion
with
me
my
mornings
and
forenoons
during
that
slack
season
were
mostly
spent
over
dickens
or
thackeray
i
now
lived
in
a
misshapen
attic
room
which
i
rented
of
an
irish
family
in
what
was
then
a
gentile
neighborhood
i
had
chosen
that
street
for
the
english
i
had
expected
to
hear
around
me
i
had
lived
more
than
two
months
in
that
attic
and
almost
the
only
english
i
heard
from
my
neighbors
were
the
few
words
my
landlady
would
say
to
me
when
i
paid
her
my
weekly
rent
yet
somehow
the
place
seemed
helpful
to
me
as
though
its
very
atmosphere
exuded
a
feeling
for
the
language
i
was
so
eager
to
master
i
made
all
sorts
of
advances
to
the
irish
family
all
sorts
of
efforts
to
get
into
social
relations
with
them
all
to
no
purpose
finally
one
evening
i
had
a
real
conversation
with
one
of
my
landlady
sons
my
window
gave
me
trouble
and
he
came
up
to
put
it
in
working
order
for
me
we
talked
of
his
work
and
of
mine
i
told
him
of
my
plans
about
going
to
college
he
was
interested
and
i
thought
him
charmingly
courteous
and
sociable
he
remained
about
an
hour
and
a
half
in
my
room
when
he
had
departed
i
was
in
high
spirits
i
seemed
to
feel
the
progress
my
english
had
made
in
that
hour
and
a
half
my
bed
was
so
placed
that
by
lying
prone
diagonally
across
it
my
head
toward
the
window
and
my
feet
suspended
in
the
air
i
would
get
excellent
daylight
so
this
became
my
favorite
posture
when
i
read
in
the
daytime
thus
lying
on
my
stomach
with
a
novel
under
my
eyes
and
the
dictionary
by
my
side
i
would
devour
scores
of
pages
in
a
few
weeks
often
reading
literally
day
and
night
i
read
through
nicholas
nickleby
and
vanity
fair
thackeray
masterpiece
did
not
strike
me
as
being
in
the
same
class
with
anything
by
dickens
it
seemed
to
me
that
anybody
in
command
of
bookish
english
ought
to
be
able
to
turn
out
a
work
like
vanity
fair
where
men
and
things
were
so
simple
and
so
natural
that
they
impressed
me
like
people
and
things
i
had
known
indeed
i
had
a
lurking
feeling
that
i
too
could
do
it
after
a
while
at
least
on
the
other
hand
nicholas
nickleby
and
dombey
and
son
were
so
full
of
extraordinary
characters
unexpected
wit
outbursts
of
beautiful
rhetoric
and
other
wonderful
things
that
their
author
appealed
to
me
as
something
more
than
a
human
being
and
yet
deep
down
in
my
heart
i
enjoyed
thackeray
more
than
i
did
dickens
it
was
at
the
east
side
branch
of
the
young
men
hebrew
association
that
i
obtained
my
books
it
was
a
sort
of
university
settlement
in
which
educated
men
and
women
from
acted
as
workers
the
advice
these
would
give
me
as
to
my
reading
their
kindly
manner
their
native
english
and
last
but
not
least
the
flattering
way
in
which
they
would
speak
of
my
intellectual
aspirations
led
me
to
spend
many
an
hour
in
the
place
the
great
thing
was
to
hear
these
people
speak
their
native
tongue
and
to
have
them
hear
me
speak
it
it
was
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
the
chat
i
had
with
the
son
of
my
irish
landlady
every
time
i
had
occasion
to
spend
five
or
ten
minutes
in
their
company
i
would
seem
to
be
conscious
of
a
perceptible
improvement
in
my
english
some
days
i
would
be
so
carried
away
by
my
reading
that
i
never
opened
my
arithmetic
at
other
times
i
would
drift
into
an
arithmetical
mood
and
sit
up
all
night
doing
problems
when
i
happened
to
be
in
raptures
over
some
book
i
would
pester
jake
with
lengthy
accounts
of
it
dwelling
on
the
chapters
i
had
read
last
and
trying
to
force
my
exaltation
upon
him
as
a
rule
he
was
bored
but
sometimes
he
would
become
interested
in
the
plot
or
in
some
romantic
scene
one
evening
as
we
were
discussing
love
in
general
i
said
love
is
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
sure
it
is
he
answered
but
if
you
love
and
are
not
loved
in
return
it
is
nothing
but
agony
even
then
it
is
sweet
i
rejoined
reflectively
the
image
of
matilda
before
me
how
can
pain
be
sweet
but
it
can
if
you
were
really
in
love
with
madame
klesmer
you
think
so
i
love
her
as
much
as
you
do
you
are
always
saying
you
do
but
you
do
yes
i
do
and
suddenly
lapsing
into
a
confidential
tone
i
questioned
him
by
the
way
jake
is
this
the
first
time
you
have
ever
been
in
love
why
i
just
want
to
know
is
it
what
difference
does
it
make
have
you
ever
been
in
love
before
what
difference
does
that
make
if
you
answer
my
question
i
shall
answer
yours
well
then
i
have
never
been
in
love
before
and
i
have
he
was
intensely
interested
and
i
confided
my
love
story
in
him
which
served
to
strengthen
our
friendship
still
further
when
i
concluded
my
narrative
he
said
thoughtfully
of
course
you
love
madame
klesmer
i
tell
you
what
levinsky
you
are
still
in
love
with
matilda
i
made
no
answer
anyhow
you
do
love
madame
klesmer
this
time
he
said
it
without
reproach
once
i
was
in
love
with
somebody
else
i
was
excused
the
next
season
came
around
i
was
a
helper
now
and
according
to
the
customary
arrangement
i
received
thirty
per
cent
of
what
joe
received
for
my
work
this
brought
me
from
twenty
to
dollars
a
week
quite
an
overwhelming
sum
according
to
my
then
standard
of
income
and
expenditures
i
saved
about
fifteen
dollars
a
week
i
shall
never
forget
the
day
when
my
capital
reached
the
round
figure
of
one
hundred
dollars
i
was
in
a
flutter
when
i
looked
at
the
in
the
street
i
would
say
to
myself
these
people
have
no
idea
that
i
am
worth
a
hundred
dollars
another
thing
i
was
ever
conscious
of
was
the
fact
that
i
had
earned
the
hundred
dollars
by
my
work
there
was
a
touch
of
solemnity
in
my
mood
as
though
i
had
performed
some
feat
of
valor
or
rendered
some
great
service
to
the
community
i
was
impelled
to
convey
this
feeling
to
jake
but
when
i
attempted
to
put
it
into
words
it
was
somehow
lost
in
a
haze
and
what
i
said
was
something
quite
prosaic
guess
how
much
i
have
in
the
i
began
i
have
any
idea
how
much
just
one
hundred
really
honest
but
then
what
does
it
amount
to
after
all
of
course
it
is
pleasant
to
feel
that
you
have
a
trade
and
that
you
know
how
to
keep
a
dollar
do
you
know
so
far
from
endearing
me
to
the
cloak
trade
as
might
have
been
expected
the
hundred
dollars
killed
at
one
stroke
all
the
interest
i
had
taken
in
it
it
lent
reality
to
my
vision
of
college
was
now
nothing
but
a
temporary
round
of
dreary
toil
an
unavoidable
to
loftier
occupations
another
year
and
i
should
be
a
fully
developed
mechanic
working
on
my
own
hook
that
is
as
the
immediate
employee
of
some
manufacturer
or
contractor
i
shall
soon
be
earning
forty
or
fifty
dollars
a
week
i
would
muse
at
that
rate
i
shall
save
up
plenty
of
money
in
much
less
time
than
i
expected
i
shall
spend
as
little
as
possible
and
study
as
hard
as
possible
the
regents
examinations
were
not
exacting
in
those
days
i
could
have
prepared
to
qualify
for
admission
to
a
school
of
medicine
law
or
civil
engineering
in
a
very
short
time
but
i
aimed
higher
i
knew
that
many
of
the
professional
men
on
the
east
side
and
indeed
everywhere
else
in
the
united
states
were
people
of
doubtful
intellectual
equipment
while
i
was
ambitious
to
be
a
cultured
man
in
the
european
way
there
was
an
odd
confusion
of
ideas
in
my
mind
on
the
one
hand
i
had
a
notion
that
to
become
an
american
was
the
only
tangible
form
of
becoming
a
man
of
culture
for
did
not
i
regard
the
most
refined
and
learned
european
as
a
greenhorn
on
the
other
hand
the
impression
was
deep
in
me
that
american
education
was
a
cheap
product
chapter
vi
college
the
sound
was
forever
buzzing
in
my
ear
the
seven
letters
were
forever
floating
before
my
eyes
they
were
a
magic
group
a
magic
whisper
matilda
was
to
hear
of
me
as
a
college
man
what
would
she
say
what
do
you
want
city
college
for
jake
would
argue
why
not
take
up
medicine
at
once
once
i
am
to
be
an
educated
man
i
want
to
be
the
genuine
article
i
would
reply
every
bit
of
new
knowledge
i
acquired
aroused
my
enthusiasm
i
was
in
a
continuous
turmoil
of
exultation
my
plan
of
campaign
was
to
keep
working
until
i
had
saved
up
six
hundred
dollars
by
which
time
i
was
to
be
eligible
to
admission
to
the
junior
class
of
the
college
of
the
city
of
new
york
commonly
known
as
city
college
where
tuition
is
free
the
six
hundred
dollars
was
to
last
me
two
years
that
is
till
graduation
when
i
might
take
up
medicine
engineering
or
law
during
the
height
of
the
cloak
season
i
might
find
it
possible
to
replenish
my
funds
by
an
occasional
few
days
at
the
or
else
it
ought
not
to
be
difficult
to
support
myself
by
joining
the
army
of
private
instructors
who
taught
english
to
our
workingmen
at
their
homes
the
image
of
the
modest
college
building
was
constantly
before
me
more
than
once
i
went
a
considerable
distance
out
of
my
way
to
pass
the
corner
of
lexington
avenue
and
street
where
that
edifice
stood
i
would
pause
and
gaze
at
its
red
walls
mysterious
high
windows
humble
spires
i
would
stand
watching
the
students
on
the
campus
and
around
the
great
doors
and
go
my
way
with
a
heart
full
of
reverence
envy
and
hope
with
a
heart
full
of
quiet
ecstasy
it
was
not
merely
a
place
in
which
i
was
to
fit
myself
for
the
battle
of
life
nor
merely
one
in
which
i
was
going
to
acquire
knowledge
it
was
a
symbol
of
spiritual
promotion
as
well
people
were
the
real
nobility
of
the
world
a
college
diploma
was
a
certificate
of
moral
as
well
as
intellectual
aristocracy
my
old
religion
had
gradually
fallen
to
pieces
and
if
its
place
was
taken
by
something
else
if
there
was
something
that
appealed
to
the
better
man
in
me
to
what
was
purest
in
my
thoughts
and
most
sacred
in
my
emotions
that
something
was
the
red
structure
on
the
southeast
corner
of
lexington
avenue
and
street
it
was
the
synagogue
of
my
new
life
nor
is
this
merely
a
figure
of
speech
the
building
really
appealed
to
me
as
a
temple
as
a
house
of
sanctity
as
we
call
the
ancient
temple
of
jerusalem
at
least
that
was
the
term
i
would
fondly
apply
to
it
years
later
in
my
retrospective
broodings
upon
the
first
few
years
of
my
life
in
america
i
was
impatiently
awaiting
the
advent
of
the
slack
season
and
when
it
came
at
last
i
applied
myself
exclusively
to
the
study
of
subjects
required
for
admission
to
college
to
accelerate
matters
i
engaged
as
my
instructor
in
mathematics
and
geography
the
son
of
our
presser
i
paid
him
cents
an
hour
my
geography
lessons
were
rapidly
dispelling
the
haze
that
had
enshrouded
the
universe
from
me
i
beheld
the
globe
hanging
in
space
a
vast
independent
world
and
yet
a
mere
speck
among
countless
myriads
of
other
worlds
its
rotations
were
so
vivid
in
my
mind
that
i
seemed
to
hear
it
hum
as
it
spun
round
and
round
its
axis
the
phenomena
producing
day
and
night
and
the
four
seasons
were
as
real
to
me
as
the
things
that
took
place
in
my
restaurant
the
earth
was
being
disclosed
to
my
mental
vision
as
a
whole
and
in
detail
order
was
coming
out
of
chaos
continents
seas
islands
mountains
rivers
countries
were
defining
themselves
out
of
a
misty
jumble
of
meaningless
names
light
was
breaking
all
around
me
life
was
becoming
clearer
i
was
broadening
out
i
was
overborne
by
a
sense
of
my
growing
perspicacity
my
keenest
pleasure
was
to
do
geometrical
problems
preferably
such
as
contained
puzzles
in
construction
on
one
occasion
i
sat
up
all
night
and
far
into
the
following
day
over
a
riddle
of
this
kind
it
was
about
when
i
dressed
and
went
to
lunch
which
was
also
my
breakfast
the
problem
was
still
unsolved
i
hurried
back
home
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
my
meal
went
at
the
problem
again
and
did
not
let
go
until
it
surrendered
odd
as
it
may
seem
i
found
a
certain
kind
of
similarity
between
the
lure
of
these
purely
mental
exercises
and
the
appeal
of
music
in
both
cases
i
was
piqued
and
harassed
by
a
personified
mystery
if
a
tune
ran
in
my
mind
it
would
appear
as
though
somebody
i
knew
not
who
was
saying
something
i
knew
not
what
what
was
he
saying
who
was
he
what
had
happened
to
him
was
he
reciting
some
grievance
bemoaning
some
loss
or
threatening
vengeance
what
was
he
nagging
me
about
questions
such
as
these
would
keep
pecking
at
my
heart
and
this
pain
this
excruciating
curiosity
i
would
call
keen
enjoyment
in
like
manner
every
difficult
mathematical
problem
seemed
to
shelter
some
unknown
fellow
who
took
pleasure
in
teasing
me
and
daring
me
to
find
him
it
was
the
same
mischievous
fellow
in
fact
who
used
to
laugh
in
my
face
when
i
had
a
difficult
bit
of
talmud
to
unravel
why
geometry
is
even
deeper
than
talmud
i
once
exclaimed
to
jake
do
you
think
so
he
answered
indifferently
i
think
an
interesting
geometrical
problem
is
more
delicious
than
the
best
piece
of
meat
why
do
you
live
on
problems
then
why
spend
money
on
dinners
smart
boy
are
you
is
doing
problems
as
sweet
as
being
in
love
he
demanded
with
sheepish
earnestness
you
are
in
love
with
madame
klesmer
you
ought
to
know
he
made
no
answer
on
the
day
when
i
began
these
studies
i
had
dollars
besides
the
hundred
which
i
kept
in
the
of
this
i
was
now
spending
including
tuition
fees
less
than
six
dollars
a
week
every
time
i
changed
a
dollar
my
heart
literally
sank
within
me
finally
when
my
cash
was
all
gone
i
borrowed
some
money
of
joe
my
rabbi
at
the
art
of
breaking
the
round
sum
total
of
my
account
was
out
of
the
question
joe
advanced
me
money
more
than
cheerfully
he
was
glad
to
have
me
in
his
debt
as
a
pledge
of
my
continuing
to
work
for
him
his
motive
was
obvious
and
yet
i
went
on
borrowing
of
him
rather
than
draw
upon
my
bank
account
one
day
it
crossed
my
mind
that
it
would
be
a
handsome
thing
if
i
looked
up
gitelson
and
paid
him
the
ten
dollars
i
owed
him
it
was
sweet
to
picture
myself
telling
him
how
much
his
ten
dollars
had
done
and
was
going
to
do
for
me
i
was
impatient
to
call
on
him
and
so
i
borrowed
ten
dollars
of
joe
and
betook
myself
to
the
factory
where
i
had
visited
gitelson
several
times
before
as
he
was
a
his
work
knew
no
seasons
when
i
called
at
that
factory
i
found
that
he
had
given
up
his
job
there
that
he
had
married
and
established
a
small
shop
somewhere
nobody
seemed
to
know
where
joe
had
not
even
heard
of
his
marriage
meanwhile
my
enthusiasm
for
paying
him
his
debt
was
gone
and
i
was
rather
glad
that
i
had
not
found
him
it
was
the
middle
of
july
the
great
winter
season
was
developing
i
felt
perfectly
competent
to
make
a
whole
garment
unaided
it
was
doubtful
however
whether
i
should
be
readily
accepted
as
an
independent
mechanic
in
the
shop
where
i
was
employed
now
and
where
one
was
in
the
habit
of
regarding
me
as
a
mere
apprentice
so
i
was
determined
to
seek
employment
elsewhere
joe
was
suspicious
not
that
i
betrayed
my
plans
in
any
way
he
took
them
for
granted
and
so
he
visited
me
every
day
on
all
sorts
of
pretexts
dined
me
and
wined
me
if
the
phrase
may
be
applied
to
a
dinner
and
watched
my
every
step
finally
i
wearied
of
it
all
and
one
afternoon
as
we
were
seated
in
the
restaurant
i
picked
a
quarrel
with
him
i
do
want
your
dinners
i
burst
out
and
i
do
want
to
be
watched
by
you
as
if
i
were
a
recruit
in
the
russian
army
and
you
were
my
uncle
i
pay
you
what
i
owe
you
and
leave
me
alone
as
if
i
were
uneasy
about
those
few
dollars
he
said
ingratiatingly
i
know
you
are
not
that
just
it
he
took
fire
what
am
i
after
then
you
think
i
get
rich
on
your
work
do
you
our
altercation
waxed
violent
at
one
point
he
was
about
to
lapse
into
a
conciliatory
tone
again
but
his
dignity
prevailed
i
would
not
keep
you
if
you
begged
me
he
declared
i
hate
to
deal
with
an
ingrate
but
i
want
my
money
at
once
i
shall
pay
it
to
you
when
work
begins
no
sirrah
i
want
it
at
once
an
ugly
scene
followed
he
seized
me
by
my
coat
lapels
and
threatened
to
have
me
arrested
finally
the
and
gussie
the
homely
finisher
girl
whom
we
all
respected
made
peace
between
us
and
things
were
arranged
more
or
less
amicably
i
obtained
employment
in
an
inside
place
a
factory
owned
by
twin
brothers
named
manheimer
i
was
in
high
feather
my
sense
of
advancement
and
independence
reminded
me
of
the
days
when
i
had
just
been
graduated
from
the
talmudic
academy
and
went
on
studying
as
an
independent
scholar
i
had
not
however
begun
to
work
in
my
new
place
when
a
general
strike
of
the
trade
was
declared
chapter
vii
the
union
had
been
a
weak
insignificant
organization
but
at
the
call
for
a
general
strike
it
suddenly
burst
into
life
there
was
a
great
rush
for
membership
cards
everybody
seemed
to
be
enthusiastic
full
of
fight
to
me
however
the
strike
was
a
sheer
calamity
i
laid
it
all
to
my
own
hard
luck
it
seemed
as
though
the
trouble
had
been
devised
for
the
express
purpose
of
preventing
me
from
being
promoted
to
full
pay
for
the
express
purpose
of
upsetting
my
financial
calculations
in
connection
with
my
college
plans
everybody
was
saying
that
prices
were
outrageously
low
that
the
manufacturers
were
taking
advantage
of
the
weakness
of
the
union
and
that
they
must
be
brought
to
terms
all
this
was
lost
upon
me
the
question
of
prices
did
not
interest
me
because
the
wages
i
was
going
to
receive
were
by
far
the
highest
i
had
ever
been
paid
but
the
main
thing
was
that
i
looked
upon
the
whole
business
of
making
cloaks
as
a
temporary
occupation
my
mind
was
full
of
my
books
and
my
college
dreams
all
i
wanted
was
to
start
the
season
as
soon
as
possible
to
save
up
the
expected
sum
and
to
reach
the
next
period
of
freedom
from
physical
toil
when
i
should
be
able
to
spend
day
and
night
on
my
studies
again
but
going
to
work
as
a
was
out
of
the
question
a
new
kind
of
public
opinion
had
suddenly
sprung
up
among
the
a
man
who
did
not
belong
to
the
union
was
a
traitor
worse
than
an
apostate
worse
than
the
worst
of
criminals
and
so
feeling
like
a
in
antomir
when
he
is
made
to
furnish
the
very
rod
with
which
he
is
to
be
chastised
i
went
to
the
headquarters
of
the
union
paid
my
initiation
fee
and
became
a
member
it
was
on
a
friday
afternoon
the
secretaries
of
the
organization
were
seated
at
a
long
table
in
the
basement
of
a
building
on
rivington
street
the
basement
and
the
street
outside
were
swarming
with
a
number
of
mass
meetings
had
been
arranged
to
take
place
in
several
halls
with
socialists
for
speakers
but
i
had
not
even
the
curiosity
to
attend
them
when
some
of
my
shopmates
reproached
me
for
my
indifference
i
said
sullenly
i
joined
the
union
what
more
do
you
want
one
of
them
a
talmudist
like
myself
spoke
of
capital
and
labor
of
the
injustice
of
the
existing
economic
order
he
had
recently
through
the
strike
been
converted
to
socialism
he
made
a
fiery
appeal
to
me
he
spoke
with
the
exaltation
of
a
new
proselyte
but
his
words
fell
on
deaf
ears
i
had
no
mind
for
anything
but
my
college
studies
do
you
think
it
right
that
millions
of
people
should
toil
and
live
in
misery
so
that
a
number
of
idlers
might
roll
in
luxury
he
pleaded
i
have
made
the
world
nor
can
i
mend
it
was
my
retort
the
manufacturers
yielded
almost
every
point
the
season
began
with
a
rush
my
for
the
first
week
contained
dollars
and
some
cents
i
knew
the
union
price
of
course
and
i
had
figured
out
the
sum
before
i
received
it
yet
when
i
beheld
the
two
figures
on
the
envelope
the
blood
surged
to
my
head
dollars
why
that
meant
rubles
i
was
tempted
to
write
naphtali
about
it
the
next
week
brought
me
an
even
fatter
envelope
i
worked
sixteen
hours
a
day
reading
and
studying
had
to
be
suspended
till
october
i
lived
on
five
dollars
a
week
my
savings
and
with
them
my
sense
of
my
own
importance
in
the
world
grew
apace
as
there
was
no
time
to
go
to
the
i
had
to
carry
what
i
deemed
a
great
sum
on
my
person
in
a
that
i
had
improvised
for
the
purpose
this
was
a
constant
source
of
anxiety
as
well
as
of
joy
no
matter
how
absorbed
i
might
have
been
in
my
work
or
in
thought
the
consciousness
of
having
that
wad
of
paper
money
with
me
was
never
wholly
absent
from
my
mind
it
loomed
as
a
badge
of
omnipotence
i
felt
in
the
presence
of
luck
which
was
a
living
spirit
a
goddess
i
was
mostly
grave
the
frivolities
of
the
other
men
in
the
factory
seemed
so
fatuous
so
revolting
a
great
sense
of
security
and
swelled
my
heart
when
i
walked
through
the
american
streets
i
would
feel
at
home
in
them
far
more
so
than
i
had
ever
felt
before
at
the
same
time
danger
was
constantly
hovering
about
danger
of
the
street
crowds
seizing
that
magic
wad
from
me
the
image
of
the
college
building
loomed
as
a
of
mine
but
that
somehow
did
not
seem
to
have
anything
to
do
with
my
as
though
i
expected
to
go
to
college
without
encroaching
upon
my
savings
a
case
of
eating
the
cake
and
having
it
the
were
so
busy
they
had
no
time
to
attend
meetings
and
being
little
accustomed
to
method
and
discipline
they
suffered
their
organization
to
melt
away
by
the
time
the
season
came
to
a
close
the
union
was
scarcely
stronger
than
it
had
been
before
the
strike
as
there
was
no
work
now
and
no
prices
to
fix
one
did
not
miss
its
protection
the
number
of
men
employed
in
the
trade
in
those
years
did
not
exceed
seven
thousand
the
industry
was
still
in
its
infancy
i
resumed
my
studies
with
a
passion
amounting
to
a
frenzy
i
would
lay
in
a
supply
of
coarse
rye
bread
cheese
and
salmon
to
last
me
two
or
even
three
days
and
never
leave
my
lair
during
that
length
of
time
i
dined
at
the
delancey
street
restaurant
every
third
or
fourth
day
and
did
not
go
to
the
theater
unless
jake
was
particularly
insistent
but
then
i
religiously
attended
felix
lectures
at
chickering
hall
on
sunday
mornings
i
valued
them
for
their
english
rather
than
for
anything
else
but
their
spirit
reinforced
by
the
effect
of
organ
music
and
the
general
atmosphere
of
the
place
would
send
my
soul
soaring
these
gatherings
and
my
prospective
alma
mater
appealed
to
me
as
being
of
the
same
order
of
things
of
the
same
world
of
refined
ways
new
thoughts
noble
interests
if
i
came
across
a
street
faker
and
he
spoke
with
a
foreign
accent
i
would
pass
on
if
however
his
english
struck
me
as
that
of
a
real
american
i
would
pause
and
listen
to
his
lecture
sometimes
for
more
than
an
hour
people
who
were
born
to
speak
english
were
superior
beings
even
among
fallen
women
i
would
seek
those
who
were
real
americans
chapter
viii
i
was
reading
pendennis
the
prospect
of
returning
to
work
was
a
hideous
vision
the
high
wages
in
store
for
me
had
lost
their
magnetism
i
often
wondered
whether
i
might
not
be
able
to
secure
some
pupils
in
english
or
hebrew
and
drop
at
once
i
dreamed
of
enlisting
the
interest
of
a
certain
maecenas
a
jew
who
financed
many
a
struggling
college
student
of
the
ghetto
thoughts
of
a
college
match
would
flash
through
my
mind
that
is
of
becoming
engaged
to
some
girl
who
earned
good
wages
and
was
willing
to
support
me
through
college
this
form
of
matrimonial
arrangement
which
has
been
mentioned
in
an
earlier
chapter
is
not
uncommon
among
our
immigrants
alliances
of
this
sort
naturally
tend
to
widen
the
intellectual
chasm
between
the
two
parties
to
the
contract
and
often
result
in
some
of
the
tragedies
or
comedies
that
fill
the
life
of
american
ghettos
but
the
ambition
to
be
the
wife
of
a
doctor
lawyer
or
dentist
is
too
strong
in
some
of
our
to
be
quenched
by
the
dangers
involved
one
of
the
young
women
i
had
in
mind
was
gussie
the
mentioned
above
who
saved
for
a
marriage
portion
too
energetically
to
make
a
marriage
she
was
a
good
girl
and
no
fool
either
and
i
thought
to
myself
that
she
would
make
me
a
good
wife
even
if
she
was
plain
and
had
a
appearance
and
was
none
too
young
i
was
too
passionately
in
love
with
my
prospective
alma
mater
to
care
whether
i
could
love
my
fiancée
or
not
i
have
a
fellow
for
you
i
said
to
gussie
under
the
guise
of
pleasantry
meeting
her
in
the
street
one
day
something
fine
who
is
it
yourself
she
asked
quickly
you
have
guessed
it
right
have
i
then
tell
your
fellow
to
go
to
all
the
black
devils
why
because
if
i
could
go
to
college
you
want
me
to
pay
your
bills
do
you
would
you
like
to
be
the
wife
of
a
doctor
you
would
take
rides
in
my
carriage
you
mean
the
other
way
around
you
would
ride
in
my
carriage
and
i
should
have
to
start
a
case
against
levinsky
you
have
to
look
for
a
bigger
fool
than
i
she
concluded
with
a
smile
it
was
an
attractive
smile
full
of
good
nature
and
common
sense
a
smile
of
this
kind
often
makes
a
homely
face
pretty
did
not
the
light
it
shed
only
served
to
publish
her
ugliness
but
i
did
not
care
the
infatuation
i
had
brought
with
me
from
antomir
had
not
yet
completely
faded
out
anyhow
and
so
i
harbored
vague
thoughts
that
some
day
when
i
saw
fit
to
press
my
suit
gussie
might
yield
i
was
getting
impatient
the
idea
of
having
to
go
back
to
work
became
more
hateful
to
me
every
day
i
was
in
despair
finally
i
decided
to
consider
my
career
as
a
closed
to
cut
my
expenses
to
the
veriest
minimum
to
live
on
my
savings
look
for
some
source
of
income
that
would
not
interfere
with
my
studies
take
the
college
examination
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
for
it
and
let
the
future
take
care
of
itself
in
the
heart
of
the
jewish
neighborhood
i
found
an
attic
for
half
of
what
i
was
paying
the
irish
family
moreover
it
was
a
neighborhood
where
everything
was
cheaper
than
in
any
other
part
of
new
york
the
only
one
in
which
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
have
a
room
to
himself
and
live
on
four
dollars
a
week
so
i
moved
to
that
attic
a
step
for
which
as
i
now
think
of
it
i
can
not
but
be
thankful
to
fate
for
it
brought
me
in
touch
with
a
quaint
simple
man
who
is
my
warm
friend
to
this
day
perhaps
the
dearest
friend
i
have
had
in
america
the
house
was
a
rickety
frame
structure
the
smallest
and
on
the
block
its
ground
floor
was
used
as
a
tailoring
shop
by
the
landlord
himself
a
giant
of
a
man
whom
i
can
not
recall
otherwise
than
as
smiling
wistfully
and
sighing
his
name
was
esrah
nodelman
his
wife
who
was
a
dwarf
beside
him
ruled
him
with
an
iron
hand
nodelman
gave
me
breakfasts
and
i
soon
felt
like
one
of
the
family
she
was
a
veritable
her
great
topic
of
conversation
being
her
son
meyer
upon
whom
she
doted
and
his
wife
whose
name
she
scarcely
ever
uttered
without
a
malediction
she
told
me
how
she
meyer
mother
her
sister
and
a
niece
had
turned
out
their
pockets
and
pawned
their
jewelry
to
help
meyer
start
in
business
as
a
he
now
worth
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
may
no
evil
eye
hit
him
she
said
he
a
good
fellow
a
lump
of
gold
if
god
had
given
him
a
better
wife
may
the
plague
carry
off
the
one
he
has
he
would
be
all
right
she
has
a
for
a
face
the
face
of
a
murderess
she
always
was
a
murderess
but
since
meyer
became
a
manufacturer
there
is
no
talking
to
her
at
all
the
airs
she
is
giving
herself
and
all
because
she
was
born
in
america
the
frog
that
she
is
i
soon
made
meyer
acquaintance
he
was
a
dark
man
of
forty
with
oriental
sadness
in
his
eyes
to
lend
his
face
capitalistic
dignity
he
had
recently
grown
a
pair
of
but
one
day
a
week
or
two
after
i
met
him
he
saw
a
circus
poster
of
jo
jo
the
human
dog
and
then
he
hastened
to
discard
them
i
do
want
to
look
like
a
he
explained
gaily
to
his
mother
who
was
unpleasantly
surprised
by
the
change
nothing
she
protested
addressing
herself
to
me
he
was
as
handsome
as
gold
in
those
whiskers
he
looked
like
a
regular
monarch
in
them
and
then
to
him
i
suppose
it
was
that
treasure
of
a
wife
you
have
who
told
you
to
have
them
taken
off
it
a
lucky
thing
she
does
not
order
you
to
have
your
foolish
head
taken
off
you
better
shut
up
mamma
he
said
sternly
and
she
did
he
called
to
see
his
parents
quite
frequently
sometimes
with
some
of
his
children
but
never
with
his
wife
at
least
not
while
i
lived
there
crassly
illiterate
save
for
his
ability
to
read
some
hebrew
without
knowing
the
meaning
of
the
words
he
enjoyed
a
considerable
degree
of
native
intellectual
alertness
and
in
his
crude
untutored
way
was
a
thinker
one
evening
he
took
to
quizzing
me
on
my
plans
partly
in
yiddish
and
partly
in
broken
english
which
he
uttered
with
a
strong
cockney
accent
a
relic
of
the
several
years
he
had
spent
in
london
and
what
will
you
do
after
you
finish
he
pronounced
it
fiendish
college
he
inquired
with
a
touch
of
derision
i
shall
take
up
some
higher
things
i
rejoined
reluctantly
and
what
do
you
call
things
he
pursued
in
his
quizzical
browbeating
way
are
you
going
to
be
a
philosopher
yes
i
shall
be
a
doctor
of
philosophy
i
answered
frostily
what
that
you
want
to
be
both
a
doctor
and
a
philosopher
but
you
know
the
saying
trades
few
blessings
i
am
not
going
to
be
a
doctor
and
a
philosopher
but
a
doctor
of
philosophy
i
said
with
a
sneer
and
how
much
will
you
make
oh
let
him
alone
meyer
his
mother
intervened
he
is
an
educated
fellow
and
he
does
care
for
money
at
all
does
care
for
money
eh
the
younger
nodelman
jeered
do
you
think
money
is
really
everything
i
shot
back
one
might
be
able
to
find
a
thing
or
two
which
could
not
be
bought
with
it
not
even
at
ridley
note
he
jested
but
he
was
manifestly
beginning
to
resent
my
attitude
and
to
take
our
passage
at
arms
rather
seriously
not
even
at
ridley
you
ca
get
brains
there
can
you
well
i
never
learned
to
write
but
i
have
a
learned
fellow
in
my
office
he
chuck
full
of
learning
and
that
sort
of
thing
yet
who
is
working
for
whom
i
for
him
or
he
for
me
so
much
for
education
for
the
stuff
that
in
a
man
head
and
now
let
take
charity
the
stuff
that
in
a
man
heart
i
do
care
what
you
say
but
of
what
use
is
a
good
heart
unless
he
has
some
jinglers
note
to
go
with
it
you
ca
shove
your
hand
into
your
heart
and
pull
out
a
few
dollars
for
a
poor
friend
can
you
you
can
help
him
out
of
your
pocket
though
that
is
provided
it
is
not
empty
my
bewigged
little
landlady
was
feasting
her
eyes
on
her
son
meyer
went
on
with
his
argument
what
is
a
man
without
capital
nothing
nobody
cares
for
him
he
is
like
a
beast
a
beast
talk
and
he
ca
talks
as
the
americans
say
his
words
and
manner
put
me
in
a
socialist
mood
he
was
hateful
to
me
i
listened
in
morose
silence
he
felt
piqued
and
he
wilted
the
ginger
went
out
of
his
voice
my
taciturnity
continued
until
gradually
he
edged
over
to
my
side
of
the
controversy
taking
up
the
cudgels
for
education
and
spiritual
excellence
with
the
same
force
with
which
he
had
a
short
while
ago
tried
to
set
forth
their
futility
of
course
it
nice
to
be
educated
he
said
a
man
without
writing
is
just
like
a
deaf
mute
what
the
difference
the
man
who
ca
write
has
speech
in
his
mouth
but
he
is
dumb
with
his
fingers
while
the
deaf
mute
he
ca
talk
with
his
mouth
but
he
can
do
so
with
his
fingers
both
should
be
pitied
i
do
like
education
of
course
i
do
do
i
send
my
boy
to
college
i
am
an
ignorant
boor
myself
because
my
father
was
poor
but
my
children
shall
have
all
the
wisdom
they
can
pile
in
we
jews
have
too
many
enemies
in
the
world
everybody
is
ready
to
shed
our
blood
so
where
would
we
be
if
many
of
our
people
were
not
among
the
wisest
of
the
wise
why
they
would
just
crush
us
like
so
many
flies
when
i
see
an
educated
jew
i
say
to
myself
it
when
he
heard
of
my
ambition
to
give
lessons
he
said
i
tell
you
what
i
be
your
first
pupil
i
mean
it
he
added
seriously
my
heart
gave
a
leap
very
well
i
try
my
best
i
replied
mind
you
i
do
want
to
be
a
philosopher
i
just
want
you
to
fix
me
up
in
reading
writing
and
figuring
a
little
bit
that
all
you
do
think
it
too
late
do
you
too
late
i
chuckled
hysterically
why
i
can
sign
or
indorse
a
check
and
thank
god
for
a
good
few
dollars
too
but
when
it
comes
to
fixing
in
the
stuffing
there
is
trouble
i
know
how
to
write
the
figures
but
not
the
words
i
can
write
almost
any
number
if
i
was
worth
all
the
money
i
can
put
down
in
figures
i
should
be
richer
than
vanderbilt
to
insure
secrecy
i
was
to
give
him
his
lessons
in
my
attic
room
i
do
want
my

like
a
little
boy
do
you
know
he
explained
american
kids
have
not
much
respect
for
their
fathers
anyhow
as
a
preliminary
to
his
initial
lesson
nodelman
offered
to
show
me
what
he
could
do
when
i
brought
pen
and
ink
and
some
paper
he
cleared
his
throat
screwed
up
a
solemn
mien
and
took
hold
of
the
pen
in
trying
to
shake
off
some
of
the
ink
he
sent
splashes
all
over
the
table
at
last
he
proceeded
to
write
his
name
he
handled
the
pen
as
he
would
a
pitchfork
it
was
quite
a
laborious
proceeding
and
his
first
attempt
was
a
fizzle
for
he
reached
the
end
of
the
paper
before
he
finished
the
in
in
nodelman
he
tried
again
and
this
time
he
was
successful
but
it
was
three
minutes
before
the
task
was
completed
it
left
him
panting
and
wiping
his
fingers
on
his
hair
a
man
who
has
to
work
as
hard
as
that
over
his
signature
has
no
business
to
be
seen
among
decent
people
he
said
with
sincere
disgust
i
ought
to
be
a
not
a
manufacturer
so
speaking
he
submitted
his
signature
for
my
inspection
without
however
letting
go
of
the
sheet
tell
me
how
rotten
it
is
he
said
bashfully
when
i
protested
that
it
was
not
rotten
at
all
he
grunted
something
to
the
effect
that
once
i
was
to
instruct
him
he
would
expect
to
pay
me
not
for
empty
compliments
but
for
the
truth
at
this
he
lighted
a
match
and
applied
it
to
the
sheet
of
paper
containing
his
signature
a
signature
is
no
joke
he
explained
as
he
watched
it
burn
put
a
few
words
and
some
figures
on
top
of
it
and
it
is
a
note
as
good
as
cash
when
a
fellow
is
a
beggar
he
has
nothing
to
fear
but
when
he
is
in
business
he
had
better
be
careful
when
he
asked
me
how
much
i
was
going
to
charge
him
and
i
said
cents
an
hour
he
smiled
i
pay
you
more
than
that
you
just
try
your
best
for
me
will
you
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
he
handed
me
two
dollars
for
three
lessons
i
was
the
happiest
man
in
new
york
that
day
if
i
had
had
to
choose
between
earning
ten
dollars
a
week
in
tuition
fees
and
a
hundred
dollars
as
wages
or
profits
i
should
without
the
slightest
hesitation
have
decided
in
favor
of
the
ten
dollars
and
now
behold
that
coveted
source
of
income
seemed
nearer
at
hand
than
i
had
dared
forecast
once
a
start
had
been
made
i
might
expect
to
procure
other
pupils
even
if
they
could
not
afford
to
pay
so
lavish
a
price
as
two
dollars
for
three
lessons
but
alas
my
happiness
was
not
to
last
long
i
was
giving
nodelman
his
fifth
lesson
we
were
spelling
out
some
syllables
in
a
first
reader
presently
he
grew
and
then
suddenly
pushing
the
from
him
said
too
late
too
late
those
black
little
dots
wo
get
through
my
forehead
it
has
grown
too
hard
for
them
i
suppose
i
attempted
to
reassure
him
but
in
vain
when
the
next
cloak
season
came
i
slunk
back
to
work
i
felt
degraded
but
i
earned
high
wages
and
my
good
spirits
soon
returned
i
firmly
made
up
my
mind
come
what
might
to
take
the
examination
the
very
next
fall
i
expected
to
have
four
hundred
dollars
by
then
but
i
was
determined
to
enter
college
even
if
i
had
much
less
i
starve
i
said
to
myself
and
if
i
do
get
enough
to
eat
hunger
is
nothing
new
to
me
the
very
firmness
of
my
purpose
was
a
source

encouragement

an

accident
a
mere
trifle
suddenly
gave
a
new
turn
to
the
trend
of
events
changing
the
character
of
my
whole
life
it
was
the
middle
of
april
the
spring
season
was
over
but
manheimer
brothers
the
firm
by
which
i
was
employed
had
received
heavy
duplicate
orders
for
silk
coats
and
considering
the
time
of
the
year
we
were
unusually
busy
one
day
at
the
lunch
hour
as
i
was
opening
a
small
bottle
of
milk
the
bottle
slipped
out
of
my
hand
and
its
contents
were
spilled
over
the
floor
and
some
silk
coats
jeff
manheimer
one
of
the
twins
happened
to
be
near
me
at
the
moment
and
a
disagreeable
scene
followed
but
first
a
word
or
two
about
jeff
manheimer
he
was
the
inside
man
of
the
firm
having
charge
of
the
mechanical
end
of
the
business
as
well
as
of
the
offices
he
was
of
german
parentage
but
of
american
birth
as
a
melon
and
with
a
tendency
to
corpulence
he
had
the
back
of
a
man
of
and
the
front
of
a
man
of
he
was
a
vivacious
fellow
one
of
those
who
are
indefatigable
in
abortive
attempts
at
being
witty
one
of
his
favorite
puns
being
that
we
russians
were
not
rushin
at
all
that
we
were
a
slow
lot
altogether
he
treated
us
as
an
inferior
race
often
lecturing
us
upon
our
lack
of
manners
i
detested
him
when
he
saw
me
drop
the
bottle
of
milk
he
flew
into
a
rage
eh
he
shouted
did
you
think
this
was
a
kitchen
ca
you
take
better
care
of
things
as
he
saw
me
crouching
and
wiping
the
floor
and
the
coats
with
my
handkerchief
he
added
you
might
as
well
take
those
coats
home
the
price
will
be
charged
against
you
that
make
you
remember
that
this
is
not
a
barn
but
a
factory
where
were
you
brought
up
among
indians
some
of
my
shopmates
tittered
obsequiously
which
encouraged
manheimer
to
further
sarcasm
why
he
does
even
know
how
to
handle
a
bottle
of
milk
did
you
ever
see
such
a
lobster
at
this
there
was
an
explosion
of
merriment
a
lobster
one
of
the
tailors
repeated
relishingly
i
could
have
murdered
him
as
well
as
manheimer
my
head
was
swimming
i
was
about
to
say
something
insulting
to
my
employer
to
get
up
and
leave
the
place
demonstratively
but
i
said
to
myself
that
i
should
soon
be
through
with
this
kind
of
life
for
good
and
i
held
myself
in
leash
two
or
three
minutes
later
i
sat
at
a
machine
eating
my
milkless
lunch
i
was
trying
to
forget
the
incident
trying
to
think
of
something
else
but
in
vain
manheimer
derision
especially
the
word
lobster
was
ringing
in
my
ear
he
passed
out
of
the
shop
but
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
later
he
came
back
and
as
i
saw
him
walk
down
the
aisle
i
became
breathless
with
hate
the
word
lobster
was
buzzing
in
my
brain
amid
vague
helpless
visions
of
revenge
presently
my
eye
fell
upon
ansel
chaikin
the
designer
and
a
strange
thought
flashed
upon
me
he
was
a
russian
like
myself
he
was
an
ignorant
tailor
as
illiterate
as
meyer
nodelman
but
a
born
artist
in
his
line
it
was
largely
to
his
skill
that
the
firm
which
was
doing
exceedingly
well
owed
the
beginning
of
its
success
it
was
the
common
talk
among
the
hands
of
the
factory
that
his
americanized
copies
of
french
models
had
found
special
favor
with
the
buyer
of
a
certain
large
department
store
and
that
this
alone
gave
the
house
a
considerable
volume
of
business
jeff
manheimer
who
superintended
the
work
was
a
commonplace
man
with
more
method
and
system
than
taste
or
initiative
chaikin
was
the
heart
and
the
actual
master
of
the
establishment
yet
all
this
really
wonderful
designer
received
was
dollars
a
week
he
knew
his
value
and
he
saw
that
the
two
brothers
were
rapidly
getting
rich
but
he
was
a
quiet
man
unaggressive
and
unassuming
and
very
likely
he
had
not
the
courage
to
ask
for
a
raise
as
i
now
looked
at
him
with
my
heart
full
of
rancor
for
manheimer
i
exclaimed
to
myself
what
a
fool
he
appeared
to
me
in
a
new
light
as
the
willing
victim
of
downright
robbery
it
seemed
obvious
that
the
manheimers
could
not
do
without
him
that
he
was
in
a
position
to
dictate
terms
to
them
even
to
make
them
accept
him
as
a
third
partner
and
once
the
matter
had
presented
itself
to
me
in
that
light
it
somehow
began
to
vex
me
it
got
on
my
nerves
as
though
it
were
an
affair
of
my
own
i
complimented
myself
upon
my
keen
sense
of
justice
but
in
reality
this
was
my
name
for
my
disgust
with
passivity
and
for
the
annoyance
and
the
burning
which
the
rapid
ascent
of
the
firm
aroused
in
me
i
begrudged
them
or
rather
jeff
the
money
they
were
making
through
his
efficiency
the
idiot
i
soliloquized
he
ought
to
start
on
his
own
hook
with
some
smart
business
man
for
a
partner
let
jeff
try
to
do
without
that
of
a
russian
the
idea
took
a
peculiar
hold
upon
my
imagination
i
could
not
look
at
ansel
chaikin
or
think
of
him
without
picturing
him
leaving
the
manheimers
in
a
lurch
and
becoming
a
fatal
competitor
of
theirs
i
beheld
their
downfall
i
gloated
over
it
but
chaikin
lacked
gumption
and
enterprise
what
he
needed
was
an
able
partner
some
man
of
brains
and
force
and
so
unbeknown
to
chaikin
the
notion
was
shaping
itself
in
my
mind
of
becoming
his
manufacturing
partner
the
thought
of
meyer
nodelman
humble
beginnings
and
of
the
three
dollars
i
had
in
my
whispered
encouragement
into
my
ear
i
had
heard
of
people
who
went
into
manufacturing
with
even
less
than
that
sum
moreover
it
was
reasonable
to
expect
that
chaikin
had
laid
up
some
money
of
his
own
our
precarious
life
among
unfriendly
nations
has
made
a
thrifty
people
of
us
and
for
a
man
like
chaikin
dollars
a
week
every
week
in
the
year
meant
superabundance
the
manheimers
were
relegated
to
the
background
it
was
no
longer
a
mere
matter
of
punishing
jeff
it
was
a
much
greater
thing
i
visioned
myself
a
rich
man
of
course
but
that
was
merely
a
detail
what
really
hypnotized
me
was
the
venture
of
the
thing
it
was
a
great
daring
game
of
life
i
tried
to
reconcile
this
new
dream
of
mine
with
my
college
projects
i
was
again
performing
the
trick
of
eating
the
cake
and
having
it
i
would
picture
myself
building
up
a
great
cloak
business
and
somehow
contriving
at
the
same
time
to
go
to
college
the
new
scheme
was
scarcely
ever
absent
from
my
mind
i
would
ponder
it
over
my
work
and
during
my
meals
it
would
visit
me
in
my
sleep
in
a
thousand
grotesque
forms
chaikin
became
the
center
of
the
universe
i
was
continually
eying
him
listening
for
his
voice
scrutinizing
his
look
his
gestures
his
clothes
he
was
an
man
of
with
almost
a
cadaverous
face
and
a
very
prominent
adam
apple
he
was
not
a
prepossessing
man
by
any
means
but
his
bluish
eyes
had
a
charming
look
of
dreaminess
and
his
smile
was
even
more
than
his
look
he
was
dressed
with
scrupulous
neatness
and
rather
pretentiously
as
behooved
his
occupation
but
all
this
would
scarcely
have
prevented
one
from
telling
him
for
a
tailor
from
some
poor
town
in
russia
now
and
then
my
project
struck
me
as
absurd
for
chaikin
was
in
the
foremost
ranks
of
a
trade
in
which
i
was
one
of
the
ruck
should
he
conceive
the
notion
of
going
into
business
on
his
own
account
he
would
have
no
difficulty
in
forming
a
partnership
with
considerable
capital
why
then
should
he
take
heed
of
a
piteous
schemer
of
my
caliber
but
a
few
minutes
later
i
would
see
the
matter
in
another
light
chapter
ii
one
sunday
morning
in
the
latter
part
of
may
i
betook
myself
to
a
certain
block
of
new
in
the
neighborhood
of
east
street
and
central
park
then
the
new
quarter
of
the
more
prosperous
russian
jews
chaikin
had
recently
moved
into
one
of
these
houses
and
it
was
to
call
on
him
that
i
had
made
my
way
from
i
found
him
in
the
playing
on
an
accordion
while
his
wife
who
had
answered
my
knock
at
the
door
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
he
scarcely
knew
me
to
pave
the
way
to
the
object
of
my
visit
i
began
by
inquiring
about
designing
lessons
as
teaching
was
not
in
his
line
we
soon
passed
to
other
topics
related
to
the
cloak
trade
i
found
him
a
poor
talker
and
a
very
uninteresting
companion
he
answered
mostly
in
monosyllables
or
with
mute
gestures
often
accompanied
by
his
grin
or
by
a
perplexed
stare
of
his
bluish
eyes
gradually
i
gave
the
conversation
a
more
personal
turn
when
somewhat
flushed
i
finally
hinted
at
my
plan
he
shrank
with
an
air
of
confusion
at
this
juncture
his
wife
made
her
appearance
followed
by
her
boy
chaikin
looked
relieved
i
hear
you
are
talking
business
she
said
summarily
taking
possession
of
the
situation
what
is
it
all
about
completely
taken
aback
by
her
domineering
manner
i
sought
escape
in
embarrassed
banter
you
have
scared
me
so
i
said
i
ca
speak
i
tell
you
everything
that
just
what
brings
me
here
only
let
me
first
catch
my
breath
and
take
a
look
at
your
stalwart
little
man
of
a
boy
her
grave
face
relaxed
into
an
involuntary
smile
what
struck
me
most
in
her
was
the
startling
resemblance
she
bore
to
her
husband
the
two
looked
like
brother
and
sister
rather
than
like
husband
and
wife
you
must
be
relatives
i
observed
for
something
pleasant
to
say
and
put
my
foot
in
it
not
at
all
she
replied
with
a
frown
to
win
back
her
good
graces
i
proceeded
to
examine
maxie
her
boy
in
spelling
the
stratagem
had
the
desired
effect
we
got
down
to
business
again
when
she
heard
my
plan
she
paused
to
survey
me
i
felt
a
sinking
at
the
heart
i
interpreted
her
searching
look
as
saying
the
nerve
this
snoozer
has
but
i
was
mistaken
her
pinched
sallow
face
grew
tense
with
excitement
and
she
said
with
coy
eagerness
how
can
we
tell
if
your
plan
amounts
to
anything
if
you
gave
us
an
idea
of
how
much
you
could
put
up
it
would
not
require
a
million
i
hazarded
a
million
who
talks
of
millions
still
it
would
take
a
good
deal
of
capital
to
start
a
factory
that
should
be
something
like
there
be
no
trouble
about
money
i
parried
fighting
shy
of
the
more
imposing
term
capital
which
made
my
paltry
three
hundred
still
paltrier
there
is
money
and
money
she
answered
with
furtive
glances
at
me
a
nickel
is
also
money
i
am
not
speaking
of
nickels
of
course
i
should
say
not
it
a
matter
of
many
thousands
of
dollars
i
was
dumfounded
but
instantly
rallied
of
course
i
assented
at
the
same
time
it
depends
on
many
things
still
you
ought
to
give
us
some
idea
how
much
you
could
put
in
is
it
is
it
say
fifteen
thousand
that
she
should
not
deem
it
unnatural
for
a
young
man
of
my
station
to
be
able
to
raise
a
sum
of
this
size
was
partly
due
to
her
utter
lack
of
experience
and
partly
to
an
impression
prevalent
among
people
of
her
class
that
nothing
is
impossible
in
the
land
of
columbus
i
pretended
to
grow
thoughtful
with
an
effect
of
making
computations
i
even
produced
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
and
indulged
in
some
sham
figuring
at
last
i
said
well
i
ca
as
yet
tell
you
exactly
how
much
as
i
have
said
it
depends
on
certain
things
but
it
be
all
right
besides
money
is
really
not
the
most
important
part
in
a
scheme
of
this
kind
a
man
of
brains
and
a
hustler
will
make
a
lot
of
money
while
a
fool
will
lose
a
lot
there
are
others
who
want
to
go
into
business
with
me
only
i
know
chaikin
is
an
honest
man
and
that
what
i
value
more
than
anything
else
i
hate
to
take
up
with
people
of
whom
i
be
sure
do
you
know
you
forget
the
main
thing
she
could
not
forbear
to
break
in
chaikin
is
the
best
designer
in
new
york
everybody
knows
that
i
conceded
deeming
it
best
to
flatter
her
vanity
that
just
what
makes
it
ridiculous
that
he
should
work
for
others
make
other
people
rich
instead
of
trying
to
do
something
for
himself
i
have
some
plans
by
which
the
two
of
us
chaikin
taking
charge
of
the
manufacturing
and
i
of
the
business
outside
would
do
wonders
we
would
simply
do
wonders
there
is
another
fine
designer
who
is
anxious
to
form
a
partnership
with
me
but
i
said
to
myself
must
first
see
if
i
could
not
get
chaikin
interested
chaikin
tried
to
guess
who
that
other
designer
was
but
i
pleaded
mysteriously
certain
circumstances
that
placed
the
seal
of
discretion
on
my
lips
i
wo
tell
anybody
she
assured
me
in
a
flutter
of
curiosity
i
know
you
wo
but
i
ca
honest
but
i
tell
you
i
wo
say
a
word
to
anybody
strike
me
dumb
if
i
do
i
ca
chaikin
i
besought
her
do
bother
her
husband
put
in
a
woman
will
be
a
woman
i
went
on
to
describe
the
wonders
that
the
firm
of
chaikin
levinsky
would
do
chaikin
eyes
glittered
i
held
her
spellbound
her
husband
who
had
hitherto
been
a
passive
listener
as
if
the
matter
under
discussion
was
one
in
which
he
was
not
concerned
began
to
show
signs
of
interest
it
was
the
longest
and
most
eloquent
speech
i
had
ever
had
occasion
to
deliver
it
seemed
to
carry
conviction
children
often
act
as
a
barometer
of
their
mother
moods
so
when
i
had
finished
and
little
maxie
slipped
up
close
to
me
and
tactily
invited
me
to
fondle
him
i
knew
that
i
had
made
a
favorable
impression
on
his
mother
i
was
detained
for
dinner
i
played
with
maxie
gave
him
problems
in
arithmetic
went
into
ecstasies
over
his
cuteness
i
had
a
feeling
that
the
way
to
chaikin
heart
was
through
maxie
but
i
took
good
care
not
to
my
part
we
are
all
actors
more
or
less
the
question
is
only
what
our
aim
is
and
whether
we
are
capable
of
a
convincing
personation
at
the
time
i
conceived
my
financial
scheme
i
knew
enough
of
human
motive
to
be
aware
of
this
chapter
iii
it
was
a
sultry
sweltering
july
afternoon
in
may
one
of
those
escapades
of
the
new
york
climate
when
the
population
finds
itself
in
the
grip
of
midsummer
discomforts
without
having
had
time
to
get
seasoned
to
them
i
went
into
the
park
i
had
come
away
from
the
chaikins
under
the
impression
that
if
i
could
raise
two
or
three
thousand
dollars
i
might
be
able
by
means
of
perseverance
and
diplomacy
to
achieve
my
purpose
but
i
might
as
well
have
set
myself
to
raise
two
or
three
millions
i
thought
of
meyer
nodelman
of
mr
even
and
his
wealthy
of
maximum
max
but
the
idea
of
approaching
them
with
my
venture
could
not
be
taken
seriously
the
images
of
gitelson
and
of
gussie
crossed
my
mind
almost
simultaneously
i
rejected
them
both
gitelson
and
i
might
perhaps
start
manufacturing
on
a
small
scale
leaving
chaikin
out
but
chaikin
was
the
very
soul
of
my
project
without
him
there
was
no
life
to
it
besides
where
was
he
gitelson
was
it
worth
while
hunting
for
him
as
for
gussie
the
notion
of
marrying
her
for
her
money
seemed
a
joke
even
if
she
were
and
younger
that
her
dower
was
anywhere
near
three
thousand
dollars
was
exceedingly
doubtful
however
the
image
of
her
face
would
not
leave
my
mind
her
hoarding
might
amount
to
over
one
thousand
and
in
my
despair
the
sum
was
tempting
she
is
a
good
girl
the
best
of
all
i
know
i
defended
myself
before
the
good
spirit
in
me
also
she
is
a
most
sensible
girl
just
the
kind
of
wife
a
business
man
needs
in
addition
i
urged
the
theory
that
a
homely
wife
is
less
likely
to
flirt
with
other
men
and
to
neglect
her
duties
than
a
one
i
took
the
car
and
made
my
way
to
gussie
lodgings
that
very
afternoon
i
did
so
before
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
i
was
prepared
to
marry
her
i
call
on
her
anyhow
i
decided
then
we
shall
see
there
can
be
no
harm
in
speaking
to
her
i
was
impelled
by
the
adventure
of
it
more
than
by
anything
else
in
spite
of
the
unbearable
heat
i
almost
felt
sure
that
i
should
find
her
at
home
going
out
of
a
sunday
required
presentable
clothes
which
she
did
not
possess
she
was
saving
for
her
dower
with
her
usual
intensity
i
was
not
mistaken
i
found
her
on
the
stoop
in
a
crowd
of
women
and
children
i
must
speak
to
you
gussie
i
said
as
she
descended
to
the
sidewalk
to
meet
me
let
go
somewhere
i
have
something
very
important
i
want
to
say
to
you
is
it
again
something
about
your
studying
to
be
a
smart
man
at
my
expense
she
asked
rather
no
no
not
at
all
it
something
altogether
different
gussie
the
nervous
emphasis
with
which
i
said
it
piqued
her
interest
without
going
for
her
hat
she
took
me
to
the
grand
street
dock
not
many
blocks
away
the
best
spots
were
already
engaged
but
we
found
one
that
suited
our
purpose
better
than
the
water
edge
would
have
done
it
was
a
secluded
nook
where
i
could
give
the
rein
to
my
eloquence
i
told
her
of
my
talk
with
the
chaikins
omitting
names
but
inventing
details
and
bits
of
local
color
calculated
to
appeal
to
my
listener
imagination
and
business
sense
she
followed
my
story
with
an
air
of
stiff
aloofness
but
this
only
added
fuel
to
the
fervor
with
which
i
depicted
the
opportunity
before
me
so
you
have
thrown
that
college
of
yours
out
of
your
mind
have
you
she
said
in
a
dry
way
i
felt
the
color
mounting
to
my
face
well
not
entirely
i
answered
not
entirely
i
mean
well
anyhow
what
do
they
do
at
college
they
read
books
ca
i
read
them
at
home
one
can
find
time
for
everything
returning
to
my
new
project
i
said
it
a
great
chance
gussie
it
would
be
an
awful
thing
if
i
had
to
let
it
slip
out
of
my
hand
that
what
i
wanted
was
her
dower
with
herself
as
an
unavoidable
appendage
went
without
saying
it
was
implied
as
a
matter
of
course
how
much
would
your
great
designer
want
you
to
invest
she
asked
with
an
air
of
one
guided
by
mere
curiosity
and
with
a
touch
of
irony
to
boot
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars
might
do
i
suppose
a
couple
of
thousand
she
said
lukewarmly
tell
your
great
designer
he
is
riding
too
high
a
horse
still
in
order
to
start
a
decent
business
i
said
throwing
a
covert
glance
at
her
have
been
started
with
a
good
deal
less
she
snapped
back
on
division
street
perhaps
and
what
do
you
fellows
expect
to
do
start
on
broadway
well
it
takes
some
money
to
get
started
even
on
division
street
not
two
thousand
it
has
been
done
for
a
good
deal
less
i
know
but
still
i
am
sure
a
fellow
must
have
some
money
it
depends
on
what
you
call
it
was
the
same
kind
of
fencing
contest
as
that
which
i
had
had
with
chaikin
i
was
sounding
gussie
purse
as
the
designer
wife
had
mine
finally
she
took
me
in
hand
for
a
severe
she
was
obviously
interested
i
contradicted
myself
in
some
minor
points
but
upon
the
whole
i
stood
the
test
well
if
it
is
all
as
you
say
she
finally
declared
there
seems
to
be
something
in
it
gussie
i
said
tremulously
there
is
a
great
chance
for
us
wait
she
interrupted
me
suddenly
bethinking
herself
of
a
new
point
if
he
is
as
great
a
designer
as
you
say
he
is
and
he
works
for
a
big
firm
how
is
it
then
that
he
ca
find
a
partner
with
big
money
he
could
any
number
of
them
but
he
has
confidence
in
me
he
says
he
would
much
rather
start
with
me
on
two
thousand
than
with
somebody
else
on
twenty
he
thinks
i
should
make
an
excellent
business
man
and
that
between
the
two
of
us
we
should
make
a
great
success
of
it
money
is
nothing
so
he
says
money
can
be
made
but
with
a
fool
of
an
outside
man
even
more
than
twenty
thousand
dollars
might
go
up
in
smoke
that
so
gussie
assented
musingly
there
was
a
pause
well
gussie
i
mustered
courage
to
demand
you
do
want
me
to
give
you
an
answer
right
off
do
you
things
like
that
are
not
decided
in
a
hurry
we
went
on
to
discuss
the
project
and
some
indifferent
topics
it
was
rapidly
growing
dark
and
cool
looming
through
the
thickening
dusk
somewhat
diagonally
across
the
dock
from
us
was
the
figure
of
a
young
fellow
with
his
head
reclining
on
the
shoulder
of
a
young
woman
a
little
further
off
and
nearer
to
the
water
i
could
discern
a
white
in
the
embrace
of
a
dark
coat
a
song
made
itself
heard
it
was
after
the
ball
is
over
one
of
the
sentimental
songs
of
that
day
followed
a
tune
usually
full
of
joyous
snap
and
go
but
now
performed
in
a
subdued
brooding
tempo
tinged
with
sadness
it
rang
in
a
girlish
soprano
the
rest
of
the
crowd
listening
silently
by
this
time
the
gloom
was
so
dense
that
the
majority
of
us
could
not
see
the
singer
which
enhanced
the
mystery
of
her
melody
and
the
charm
of
her
young
voice
presently
other
voices
joined
in
all
in
the
same
meditative
somewhat
doleful
rhythm
gayer
strains
would
have
sounded
sacrilegiously
out
of
tune
with
the
darkling
glint
of
the
river
with
the
mysterious
splash
of
its
waves
against
the
bobbing
bulkheads
of
the
pier
with
the
starry
enchantment
of
the
passing
with
the
solemnity
of
the
spring
night
i
had
not
the
heart
even
to
think
of
business
much
less
to
talk
it
we
fell
silent
both
of
us
listening
to
the
singing
poor
gussie
she
was
not
a
pretty
girl
and
she
did
not
interest
me
in
the
least
yet
at
this
moment
i
was
drawn
to
her
the
brooding
plaintive
tones
which
resounded
around
us
had
a
bewitching
effect
on
me
it
filled
me
with
yearning
it
filled
me
with
love
gussie
was
a
woman
to
me
now
my
hand
sought
hers
it
was
an
honest
proffer
of
endearment
for
my
soul
was
praying
for
communion
with
hers
she
withdrew
her
hand
this
should
not
be
done
in
a
hurry
either
she
explained
pensively
gussie
dear
gussie
i
said
sincerely
though
not
unaware
of
the
temporary
nature
of
my
feeling
do
she
implored
me
there
was
something
in
her
plea
which
seemed
to
say
you
know
you
do
care
for
me
it
my
money
that
has
brought
you
here
alas
it
is
not
my
lot
to
be
loved
for
my
own
sake
her
unspoken
words
broke
my
heart
gussie
i
swear
to
you
you
dear
to
me
ca
you
believe
me
the
singing
night
was
too
much
for
her
she
yielded
to
my
arms
urged
on
by
the
chill
air
we
clung
together
in
a
delirium
of
there
were
passionate
embraces
and
kisses
i
felt
that
her
thin
lips
were
not
to
my
taste
but
i
went
on
kissing
them
with
unfeigned
fervor
the
singing
echoed
dolefully
we
remained
in
that
secluded
nook
until
the
growing
chill
woke
us
from
our
trance
i
took
her
home
when
we
reached
a
tiny
square
jammed
with
we
paused
to
kiss
once
more
and
when
we
found
ourselves
in
front
of
her
stoop
which
was
now
deserted
the
vigorous
with
which
i
took
my
leave
was
symbolic
of
another
kiss
i
went
away
without
discovering
the
size
of
her
hoard
i
was
to
call
on
her
the
next
evening
as
i
trudged
along
through
the
swarming
streets
on
my
way
home
the
predominant
feeling
in
my
heart
was
one
of
physical
distaste
poor
thing
i
felt
that
marrying
her
was
out
of
the
question
nevertheless
the
next
evening
i
went
to
see
her
as
arranged
i
found
her
out
her
landlady
handed
me
a
letter
it
was
in
yiddish
levinsky
it
read
i
do
not
write
this
myself
for
i
can
not
write
and
i
do
not
want
you
to
think
that
i
want
to
make
believe
that
i
can
a
man
is
writing
it
for
me
for
ten
cents
i
am
telling
him
the
words
and
he
is
writing
just
as
i
tell
him
it
was
all
a
mistake
you
know
what
i
mean
i
do
care
to
marry
you
you
are
too
smart
for
me
and
too
young
too
i
am
afraid
of
you
i
am
a
simple
girl
and
you
are
educated
i
must
look
for
my
equal
if
i
married
you
both
of
us
would
be
sorry
for
it
excuse
me
and
i
wish
you
well
please
do
come
to
see
me
any
more
gussie
the
message
left
me
with
a
feeling
of
shame
sadness
and
commiseration
during
that
evening
and
the
forenoon
of
the
following
day
i
was
badly
out
of
spirits
there
was
nothing
to
do
at
the
shop
yet
i
went
there
just
to
see
chaikin
so
as
to
keep
up
his
interest
in
my
scheme
he
was
glad
to
see
me
he
had
a
message
from
his
wife
who
wanted
me
to
call
in
the
evening
gussie
letter
was
blotted
out
of
my
memory
i
was
once
more
absorbed
in
my
project
i
spent
the
evening
at
the
designer
house
chaikin
made
new
attempts
at
worming
out
the
size
of
my
fortune
and
in
addition
something
concerning
its
origin
is
it
an
inheritance
she
queried
an
inheritance
why
would
you
like
me
to
get
one
i
said
playfully
as
though
talking
to
a
child
she
could
not
help
laughing
well
then
is
it
from
a
rich
brother
or
a
sister
or
is
it
your
own
money
she
pursued
falling
in
with
the
facetious
tone
that
i
was
affecting
any
kind
of
money
you
wish
chaikin
but
seriously
there
will
be
no
trouble
about
cash
the
main
point
is
that
i
want
to
go
into
manufacturing
and
that
i
should
prefer
to
have
chaikin
for
my
partner
there
is
plenty
of
money
in
cloaks
and
i
am
bent
upon
making
heaps
great
heaps
of
it
for
chaikin
and
myself
really
is
it
maddening
to
think
that
he
should
be
making
other
people
rich
while
all
he
gets
is
a
miserable
few
dollars
a
week
it
simply
outrageous
so
speaking
i
worked
chaikin
up
to
a
high
sense
of
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
i
was
rapidly
gaining
ground
with
her
and
so
pending
that
mysterious
something
to
which
i
was
often
alluding
as
the
source
of
my
prospective
fortune
i
became
a
frequent
visitor
at
her
house
sometimes
she
would
invite
me
to
supper
once
or
twice
we
spent
sunday
together
as
for
little
maxie
he
invariably
hailed
me
with
joy
i
was
actually
fond
of
him
and
i
was
glad
of
it
chapter
iv
the
time
i
speak
of
the
late
and
the
early
is
connected
with
an
important
and
interesting
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
american
cloak
business
hitherto
in
the
control
of
german
jews
it
was
now
beginning
to
pass
into
the
hands
of
their
russian
the
change
being
effected
under
peculiar
conditions
that
were
destined
to
lead
to
a
stupendous
development
of
the
industry
if
the
average
american
woman
is
dressed
infinitely
better
than
she
was
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
and
if
she
is
now
easily
the
average
woman
in
the
world
the
fact
is
due
in
a
large
measure
to
the
change
i
refer
to
the
transition
was
inevitable
while
the
manufacturers
were
german
jews
their
contractors
tailors
and
machine
operators
were
immigrants
from
russia
or
austrian
galicia
although
the
former
were
of
a
superior
commercial
civilization
it
was
after
all
a
case
of
greek
meeting
greek
and
the
circumstances
were
such
that
just
because
they
represented
a
superior
commercial
civilization
they
were
doomed
to
be
beaten
the
german
manufacturers
were
the
pioneers
of
the
industry
in
america
it
was
a
new
industry
in
fact
scarcely
twenty
years
old
formerly
and
as
late
as
the
women
cloaks
and
jackets
were
little
known
in
the
united
states
shawls
were
worn
by
the
masses
what
few
cloaks
were
seen
on
women
of
means
and
fashion
were
imported
from
germany
but
the
demand
grew
so
gradually
some
merchants
and
an
american
shawl
firm
bethought
themselves
of
manufacturing
these
garments
at
home
the
industry
progressed
the
great
russian
immigration
a
child
of
the
massacres
of
and
bringing
the
needed
army
of
tailors
for
it
there
was
big
money
in
the
cloak
business
and
it
would
have
been
unnatural
if
some
of
these
tailors
had
not
sooner
or
later
begun
to
think
of
going
into
business
on
their
own
hook
at
first
it
was
a
hard
struggle
the
american
business
world
was
slow
to
appreciate
the
commercial
possibilities
which
these
represented
but
it
learned
them
in
course
of
time
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
this
transition
period
that
my
scheme
was
born
in
my
mind
schemes
of
that
kind
were
in
the
air
meyer
nodelman
the
son
of
my
landlady
had
not
the
remotest
inkling
of
my
plans
yet
i
had
consulted
him
about
them
more
than
once
of
course
it
was
all
done
in
a
purely
abstract
way
like
the
majority
of
our
people
he
was
a
talkative
man
so
i
would
try
to
keep
him
talking
shop
by
a
system
of
seemingly
casual
questioning
i
would
pump
him
on
sundry
details
of
the
clothing
business
on
the
differences
and
similarities
between
it
and
the
cloak
trade
and
more
especially
on
how
one
started
on
a
very
small
capital
he
bragged
and
blustered
but
oftentimes
he
would
be
carried
away
by
the
sentimental
side
of
his
past
struggles
then
he
would
unburden
himself
of
a
great
deal
of
unvarnished
history
on
such
occasions
i
would
obtain
from
him
a
veritable
treasure
of
information
and
suggestions
some
of
the
generalizations
of
this
homespun
and
quaint
thinker
too
were
interesting
talking
of
credit
for
example
he
once
said
when
a
fellow
is
a
beginner
it
a
good
thing
if
he
has
a
credit
face
i
thought
it
was
some
sort
of
commercial
term
he
was
using
and
when
i
asked
him
what
it
meant
he
said
why
some
people
are
just
born
with
the
kind
of
face
that
makes
the
woolen
merchant
or
the
bank
president
trust
them
they
are
not
more
honest
than
some
other
fellows
indeed
some
of
them
are
plain
pickpockets
but
they
have
a
credit
face
so
you
have
got
to
trust
them
you
just
ca
help
it
and
if
they
do
pay
but
they
do
they
get
credit
from
somebody
else
and
pay
the
jobber
or
the
banker
then
they
get
more
credit
from
these
people
and
pay
the
other
fellows
people
of
this
kind
can
do
a
big
business
without
a
cent
of
capital
in
russia
a
fellow
who
pays
his
bills
is
called
an
honest
man
but
america
is
miles
ahead
of
russia
here
you
can
be
the
best
pay
in
the
world
and
yet
be
a
crook
you
would
say
that
every
man
who
breathes
god
air
is
honest
would
you
well
paying
your
bills
in
america
is
like
breathing
if
you
do
you
are
dead
chaikin
too
often
let
fall
in
his
hesitating
monosyllabic
way
some
observation
which
i
considered
of
value
of
the
purely
commercial
side
of
the
industry
he
knew
next
to
nothing
but
then
he
could
tell
me
a
thing
or
two
concerning
the
psychology
of
popular
taste
the
forces
operating
behind
the
scenes
of
fashion
the
methods
employed
by
small
firms
in
stealing
styles
from
larger
ones
and
other
tricks
of
the
trade
at
last
i
resolved
to
act
it
was
the
height
of
the
season
for
winter
orders
and
i
decided
to
take
time
by
the
forelock
one
day
when
i
called
at
the
designer
and
chaikin
asked
me
for
news
alluding
to
the
thousands
i
was
supposed
to
be
expecting
i
said
well
i
have
rented
a
shop
rented
a
shop
that
what
i
did
it
no
use
missing
the
season
if
a
fellow
wants
to
do
something
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
to
work
and
do
it
else
he
is
doomed
to
be
a
slave
all
his
life
when
i
added
that
the
shop
was
on
division
street
her
face
fell
but
what
difference
does
it
make
where
it
is
i
argued
with
studied
vehemence
it
only
a
place
to
make
samples
in
for
a
start
chaikin
is
not
going
into
a
wee
bit
of
a
business
like
that
no
sir
in
the
course
of
our
many
discussions
it
had
often
happened
that
after
overruling
me
with
great
finality
she
would
end
by
yielding
to
my
point
of
view
i
hoped
this
would
be
the
case
in
the
present
instance
do
be
so
hasty
chaikin
i
said
with
a
smile
wait
till
you
know
a
little
more
about
the
arrangement
and
dropping
into
the
talmudic
singsong
which
usually
comes
back
to
me
when
my
words
assume
an
argumentative
character
i
proceeded
in
the
first
place
i
do
want
chaikin
to
leave
the
manheimers
not
yet
all
i
want
him
to
do
is
to
attend
to
our
shop
evenings
do
be
uneasy
the
manheimers
wo
get
wind
of
it
leave
that
to
me
well
all
i
want
is
some
samples
to
go
around
the
stores
with
the
rest
will
come
easy
we
make
things
hum
see
if
we
do
when
we
have
orders
and
get
really
started
we
move
out
of
division
street
of
course
we
will
but
would
it
not
be
foolish
to
open
up
on
a
large
scale
and
have
chaikin
give
up
his
job
before
we
have
accomplished
anything
i
think
it
would
indeed
it
my
money
that
going
to
be
invested
do
you
blame
me
for
being
careful
at
the
beginning
at
least
i
neither
want
chaikin
to
risk
his
job
nor
myself
to
risk
big
money
but
you
have
even
told
me
how
much
you
can
put
in
she
blurted
out
excitedly
as
much
as
will
be
necessary
but
what
the
use
dumping
a
big
lot
at
once
many
a
big
business
has
failed
while
firms
who
start
in
a
modest
way
have
worked
themselves
up
why
should
chaikin
begin
by
risking
his
position
why
why
the
long
and
short
of
it
was
that
chaikin
became
enthusiastic
for
my
division
street
shop
and
the
next
day
her
husband
took
two
hours
off
to
accompany
me
to
a
nondescript
on
hester
street
where
we
bought
fifty
dollars
worth
of
material
the
rent
for
the
shop
was
thirty
dollars
a
month
one
month
rent
for
two
was
two
dollars
a
large
table
for
designing
and
cutting
and
some
old
chairs
cost
me
twelve
dollars
more
leaving
me
a
balance
of
over
two
hundred
dollars
before
i
went
to
rent
the
premises
for
our
prospective
shop
i
had
withdrawn
my
money
from
the
and
deposited
it
in
a
small
bank
where
i
opened
a
check
account
once
i
am
to
play
the
part
of
a
manufacturer
it
would
not
do
to
pay
bills
in
cash
i
reflected
i
must
pay
in
checks
and
do
so
like
one
to
the
manner
born
at
this
the
magic
word
credit
loomed
in
letters
of
gold
before
me
i
was
aware
of
the
fascination
of
so
being
armed
with
one
i
expected
to
be
able
to
buy
things
in
some
cases
at
least
without
having
to
pay
for
them
at
once
besides
my
bank
might
be
induced
to
grant
me
a
loan
then
too
one
might
issue
a
check
before
one
had
the
amount
and
thereby
gain
a
day
time
there
seemed
to
be
a
world
of
possibilities
in
the
long
narrow
book
in
my
breast
pocket
i
was
ever
conscious
of
its
presence
i
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
elation
with
which
i
drew
and
issued
my
first
check
in
payment
of
thirty
dollars
the
first
month
rent
for
our
prospective
humanity
seemed
to
have
become
divided
into
two
distinct
classes
those
who
paid
their
obligations
in
cash
and
those
who
paid
them
in
checks
i
still
have
that
first
of
mine
chapter
v
chaikin
made
up
half
a
dozen
sample
garments
i
took
them
to
the
department
store
to
which
the
manheimer
brothers
catered
but
the
buyer
of
the
cloak
department
would
not
so
much
as
let
me
untie
my
bundle
he
was
a
man
women
buyers
were
rare
in
those
days
an
of
commanding
figure
after
sweeping
me
with
a
glance
of
cold
curiosity
he
waved
me
aside
my
russian
name
and
my
appearance
were
evidently
against
me
i
tried
the
other
department
stores
with
the
same
result
the
larger
business
world
of
the
city
had
not
yet
learned
to
take
the
russian
jew
seriously
as
a
factor
in
advanced
commerce
the
buyer
of
the
cloak
department
in
the
last
store
i
visited
was
an
american
jew
a
little
fellow
all
aglitter
with
neatness
at
first
he
took
an
amused
interest
in
me
when
i
had
unpacked
my
goods
and
was
about
to
show
him
one
of
chaikin
jackets
he
checked
me
suppose
we
gave
you
an
order
for
five
hundred
he
said
with
a
smile
five
hundred
jackets
to
be
delivered
at
a
certain
date
i
would
deliver
it
i
answered
boldly
why
not
i
do
know
why
maybe
you
would
maybe
you
would
how
can
we
be
sure
you
would
before
i
had
time
to
answer
he
asked
me
how
long
i
had
been
in
the
country
when
i
told
him
he
complimented
me
on
my
english
i
was
sure
it
meant
business
i
was
thrilled
have
you
got
a
shop
he
further
questioned
how
many
hands
do
you
employ
he
sized
me
up
where
is
your
place
on
division
street
well
well
what
is
your
rating
i
did
not
know
what
he
meant
so
for
an
answer
i
made
a
new
attempt
to
submit
the
contents
of
my
bundle
for
his
inspection
at
this
he
made
a
gesture
of
disgust
and
withdrew
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
my
forehead
i
had
heard
of
the
existence
of
small
department
stores
in
various
sections
of
the
city
so
i
went
in
search
of
them
i
found
myself
in
the
vicinity
of
the
city
college
as
i
passed
that
corner
i
studiously
looked
away
i
felt
like
a
convert
jew
passing
a
synagogue
it
was
a
warm
day
my
pack
seemed
to
grow
heavier
with
every
block
i
walked
and
so
did
my
heart
i
was
perspiring
freely
my
collar
wilted
all
of
which
did
anything
but
make
me
look
as
a
man
who
paid
his
bills
in
checks
at
last
walking
up
third
avenue
i
came
across
a
place
where
there
was
quite
a
large
display
of
jackets
in
the
windows
upon
my
opening
the
door
and
announcing
my
mission
two
jaunty
young
fellows
invited
me
in
with
elaborate
courtesy
almost
with
anxiety
my
heart
leaped
for
joy
i
fell
to
opening
my
bundle
the
two
young
men
inspected
every
jacket
went
into
ecstasies
over
each
of
them
and
then
asked
me
all
sorts
of
irrelevant
questions
until
it
dawned
upon
me
that
i
was
being
made
game
of
it
appeared
that
the
father
of
the
two
young
men
the
proprietor
of
the
store
manufactured
his
own
goods
for
wholesale
as
well
as
for
retail
trade
i
received
much
better
treatment
in
a
store
on
avenue
b
but
my
goods
proved
too
high
for
that
neighborhood
as
if
to
atone
for
this
the
proprietor
of
this
store
a
kindly
galician
jew
gave
me
a
list
of
the
minor
department
stores
i
was
looking
for
and
some
valuable
suggestions
in
addition
my
dinner
that
day
consisted
of
two
rolls
which
i
bought
in
a
jewish
and
which
i
ate
on
a
bench
in
tompkins
square
the
day
passed
most
discouragingly
it
was
about
when
disheartened
to
the
point
of
despair
i
dragged
my
wearied
limbs
in
the
direction
of
my
factory
when
i
got
there
i
found
my
partner
waiting
for
me
not
alone
but
in
the
company
of
his
wife
well
she
shrieked
jumping
to
meet
me
splendid
i
replied
with
enthusiasm
it
looks
even
better
than
i
expected
i
could
have
got
good
orders
at
once
but
a
fellow
must
not
be
too
hasty
you
have
got
to
look
around
first
find
out
who
is
who
you
know
chaikin
looked
crestfallen
so
you
did
not
get
any
orders
at
all
what
your
hurry
her
husband
said
pleadingly
levinsky
is
right
you
ca
sell
goods
unless
you
know
who
you
deal
with
the
following
two
days
were
as
barren
of
results
as
the
first
chaikin
had
lost
all
confidence
in
the
venture
she
was
becoming
rather
hard
to
handle
i
do
want
ansel
to
bother
any
more
she
said
peevishly
you
know
what
the
americans
say
is
money
pay
ansel
for
his
work
and
let
us
be
at
a
distance
very
well
i
said
and
producing
my
i
asked
how
much
is
it
the
sight
of
my
acted
like
a
charm
the
situation
suddenly
assumed
brighter
colors
in
cbaikin
eyes
look
at
him
he
thought
i
really
meant
it
she
grinned
sheepishly
every
night
i
would
go
to
bed
sick
at
heart
and
with
my
mind
half
made
up
to
drop
it
all
only
to
wake
in
the
morning
more
resolute
and
hopeful
than
ever
hopeful
and
defiant
it
was
as
though
somebody
the
whole
world
were
jeering
at
my
piteous
efforts
and
i
was
bound
to
make
good
just
for
spite
i
learned
of
the
existence
of
purchasing
offices
where
the
buyers
of
several
department
stores
from
so
many
cities
made
their
headquarters
in
new
york
also
i
discovered
that
in
order
to
keep
track
of
the
arrivals
of
these
buyers
i
must
follow
a
daily
paper
called
hotel
reporter
the
ordinary
newspapers
did
not
furnish
information
of
this
character
in
those
days
a
man
who
manufactured
neckties
in
the
same
ramshackle
building
in
which
i
hoped
to
manufacture
cloaks
volunteered
to
let
me
look
at
his
reporter
every
day
this
man
was
naturally
inclined
to
be
neighborly
but
i
had
found
that
an
occasional
quotation
or
two
from
the
talmud
was
particularly
helpful
in
obtaining
a
small
favor
from
him
i
knocked
about
among
the
purchasing
offices
with
bulldog
tenacity
but
during
the
first
few
days
my
efforts
in
this
direction
were
as
futile
as
in
the
case
of
the
new
york
stores
meanwhile
time
was
pressing
so
far
as
buyers
were
concerned
the
winter
season
was
drawing
to
a
close
all
i
could
see
were
some
belated
stragglers
one
of
these
was
a
man
from
the
middle
west
a
stout
fleshy
american
with
quick
nervous
movements
which
contradicted
his
face
he
shot
a
few
glances
at
my
samples
just
to
get
rid
of
me
but
he
liked
the
designs
and
i
could
see
that
he
found
my
prices
tempting
how
soon
will
you
be
able
to
deliver
five
hundred
he
snarled
in
three
weeks
very
well
go
ahead
and
speaking
in
his
jerky
impatient
way
he
went
on
to
specify
how
many
cloaks
he
wanted
of
each
kind
i
left
him
with
my
heart
divided
between
unutterable
triumph
and
black
despair
five
hundred
cloaks
how
would
i
raise
the
money
for
so
much
raw
material
it
almost
looked
like
another
practical
joke
by
this
time
i
was
more
than
sure
that
the
chaikins
had
a
considerable
little
pile
but
to
turn
to
them
for
funds
was
impossible
it
would
have
let
my
cat
out
of
the
bag
i
sought
credit
at
claflin
and
at
half
a
dozen
smaller
places
but
all
in
vain
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
nodelman
credit
face
ah
if
that
kind
of
a
face
had
fallen
to
my
lot
but
it
had
not
it
seemed
it
looked
as
if
there
were
no
hope
for
me
finally
i
took
the
necktie
man
into
my
confidence
the
result
being
that
he
unburdened
himself
of
his
own
financial
straits
to
me
one
afternoon
i
was
moping
around
some
of
the
off
lower
broadway
in
quest
of
some
new
place
where
i
might
try
to
beg
for
credit
when
i
noticed
the
small
of
a
commission
merchant
upon
entering
the
place
i
found
a
elderly
american
dictating
something
to
a
stenographer
when
the
man
had
heard
my
plea
be
looked
me
over
from
head
to
foot
i
felt
like
a
prisoner
facing
the
jury
which
is
about
to
announce
its
verdict
at
last
he
said
well
you
look
pretty
reliable
i
guess
i
trust
you
the
goods
for
thirty
days
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
restrain
myself
from
invoking
benedictions
on
his
head
and
kissing
his
hands
as
my
mother
would
have
done
under
similar
circumstances
so
i
do
have
a
face
i
exclaimed
to
myself
gleefully
when
i
found
myself
in
the
street
again
i
looked
at
my
reflection
in
store
windows
scanning
my
credit
face
the
chaikins
took
it
for
granted
that
i
had
paid
for
the
goods
on
the
spot
things
brightened
up
at
our
factory
i
ordered
an
additional
of
the
instalment
agent
and
hired
two
operators
poor
fellows
who
were
willing
to
work
fourteen
or
fifteen
hours
a
day
for
twelve
dollars
a
week
the
union
had
again
been
revived
but
it
was
weak
and
my
employees
did
not
belong
to
it
as
for
myself
i
toiled
at
my
machine
literally
day
and
night
snatching
two
or
three
hours
sleep
at
dawn
with
some
bundles
of
cut
goods
or
cloaks
for
a
bed
chaikin
spent
every
night
from
to
with
me
cutting
the
goods
and
doing
the
better
part
of
the
other
work
chaikin
too
lent
a
hand
leaving
maxie
in
the
care
of
her
mother
she
would
spend
several
hours
a
day
in
the
factory
finishing
the
cloaks
the
five
hundred
cloaks
were
shipped
on
time
i
was
bursting
with
consciousness
of
the
fact
that
i
was
a
manufacturer
that
a
big
firm
out
west
a
firm
of
gentiles
mind
you
was
recognizing
my
claim
to
the
title
i
was
american
enough
to
be
alive
to
the
special
glamour
of
the
words
out
west
goods
in
our
line
of
business
usually
sold
for
cash
which
meant
ten
days
ten
days
more
then
and
i
should
receive
a
big
check
from
that
firm
that
would
enable
me
to
start
new
operations
accordingly
i
went
out
to
look
for
more
orders
whether
my
first
success
had
put
new
confidence
in
me
or
whether
my
past
experiences
had
somewhat
rounded
off
my
rough
edges
and
enabled
me
to
speak
to
business
people
in
a
more
effective
manner
than
i
could
have
done
before
the
proprietor
of
a
small
department
store
on
upper
third
avenue
let
me
show
him
my
samples
my
prices
made
an
impression
on
him
my
cloaks
were
five
dollars
apiece
lower
than
he
was
in
the
habit
of
paying
he
looked
askance
at
me
as
though
my
figures
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
until
i
found
it
the
best
policy
to
tell
him
the
unembellished
truth
the
big
manufacturers
of
whom
you
buy
have
big
office
expenses
i
explained
they
make
a
lot
of
fuss
and
you
got
to
pay
for
it
my
principle
is
not
to
make
fuss
at
the
expense
our
office
costs
us
very
very
little
we
are
plain
people
but
that
is
all
your
big
manufacturer
pays
for
union
labor
so
he
takes
it
out
of
you
now
we
do
bother
about
these
things
we
get
the
best
work
done
for
the
lowest
wages
the
big
men
in
the
business
would
even
know
where
hands
of
this
kind
could
be
got
we
do
i
took
my
departure
with
an
order
for
three
hundred
cloaks
expecting
to
begin
work
on
them
as
soon
as
i
received
that
check
from
out
west
things
seemed
to
be
coming
my
way
as
i
sat
in
an
elevated
train
going
i
figured
the
profits
on
the
two
orders
and
pictured
other
orders
coming
in
i
beheld
our
little
factory
crowded
with
machines
i
heard
their
bewitching
chaikin
would
have
to
leave
the
manheimers
of
course
in
the
afternoon
of
the
sixth
day
when
i
called
at
one
of
the
purchasing
offices
i
have
mentioned
i
received
the
information
that
the
firm
whose
check
i
was
awaiting
so
impatiently
had
failed
chapter
vi
the
failure
of
the
western
firm
seemed
to
have
nipped
my
commercial
career
in
the
bud
the
large
order
i
had
received
from
its
representative
was
apparently
to
be
the
death
as
well
as
the
birth
of
my
glory
in
my
despair
i
tried
to
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
i
was
telling
myself
that
it
served
me
right
that
i
had
had
no
business
to
abandon
my
intellectual
pursuits
i
was
inclined
to
behold
something
like
the
hand
of
providence
in
the
bankruptcy
of
that
firm
at
the
same
time
i
was
casting
about
in
my
mind
for
some
way
of
raising
new
money
with
which
to
pay
the
kindly
commission
merchant
get
a
new
bill
of
goods
from
him
and
fill
my
new
order
when
i
explained
the
matter
to
chaikin
she
was
on
the
brink
of
a
fainting
spell
you
a
liar
and
a
thief
she
shrieked
there
never
was
a
western
firm
in
the
world
it
all
a
lie
you
sold
the
goods
for
cash
her
husband
knew
something
about
firms
and
credit
so
i
had
no
difficulty
in
substantiating
my
assertion
to
him
it
only
a
matter
of
days
when
i
shall
get
the
big
check
that
is
coming
to
me
i
assured
them
i
went
on
to
spin
a
long
yarn
to
which
she
listened
with
jeers
and
outbursts
of
uncomplimentary
yiddish
one
day
i
mustered
courage
and
called
on
chaikin
i
did
so
on
an
afternoon
when
her
husband
was
sure
to
be
at
work
because
i
had
a
lurking
feeling
that
being
alone
with
me
she
would
be
easier
to
deal
with
when
she
saw
me
she
gasped
what
you
she
said
you
have
the
nerve
to
come
up
here
come
come
chaikin
i
said
earnestly
please
be
seated
and
let
us
talk
it
all
over
in
a
manner
with
your
sense
and
especially
with
your
sense
for
business
you
will
understand
me
please
do
flatter
me
she
demurred
sternly
but
i
knew
that
nothing
appealed
to
her
vanity
so
much
as
being
thought
a
clever
business
woman
and
i
protested
flatter
you
in
the
first
place
it
is
a
fact
that
women
have
more
sense
than
men
in
the
second
place
it
is
the
talk
of
every
that
chaikin
owes
his
high
position
to
you
as
much
as
to
his
own
ability
everybody
everybody
says
so
i
talked
of
unforeseen
difficulties
of
a
landlord
whose
big
check
i
was
expecting
every
day
i
composed
a
story
about
that
landlord
agreed
with
chaikin
that
it
had
been
a
mistake
on
my
part
to
trust
the
buyer
of
that
western
firm
the
goods
without
first
consulting
her
and
the
upshot
was
that
she
made
me
stay
to
supper
and
that
pending
the
arrival
of
chaikin
i
took
maxie
to
the
park
the
of
my
story
was
mr
even
of
course
i
had
portrayed
him
vividly
as
coming
to
my
rescue
in
my
present
predicament
so
vividly
indeed
that
my
own
fib
haunted
me
the
next
day
the
result
was
that
in
the
evening
i
made
myself
as
presentable
as
i
could
and
repaired
to
the
synagogue
where
he
spent
much
of
his
time
reading
talmud
i
had
not
visited
the
place
since
that
memorable
day
my
first
day
in
america
i
recognized
it
at
once
i
was
thrilled
the
years
seemed
mr
even
was
not
there
but
he
soon
came
in
he
had
aged
considerably
he
was
beginning
to
look
somewhat
decrepit
his
dignity
was
tinged
with
the
sadness
of
old
age
good
evening
mr
even
do
you
know
me
i
began
he
scanned
me
closely
but
failed
to
recognize
me
i
am
david
levinsky
the
one
you
befriended
four
and
a
half
years
ago
do
you
remember
me
mr
even
it
was
in
this
very
place
where
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
the
son
of
the
woman
who
was
killed
by
gentiles
in
antomir
i
added
mournfully
oh
yes
indeed
he
said
with
a
wistful
smile
somewhat
abashed
he
took
snuff
looked
me
over
once
more
and
as
if
his
memory
had
been
brightened
by
the
snuff
he
burst
out
lord
of
the
world
you
are
that
young
man
why
i
confess
i
scarcely
recognize
you
of
course
i
remember
it
all
why
of
course
i
remember
you
well
well
how
have
you
been
getting
along
in
america
ca
complain
not
at
all
you
remember
that
evening
after
you
provided
me
with
a
complete
outfit
like
a
father
fixing
up
his
son
for
his
and
you
gave
me
five
dollars
into
the
bargain
you
told
me
not
to
call
on
you
again
until
i
was
well
established
in
life
do
you
remember
that
of
course
i
do
he
answered
with
a
beaming
glance
at
two
old
talmudists
who
sat
at
their
books
close
by
well
here
i
am
i
am
running
a
he
began
to
question
me
about
my
affairs
with
sad
curiosity
i
said
that
business
was
good
too
good
in
fact
so
that
it
required
somewhat
more
capital
than
i
possessed
i
soon
realized
however
that
he
did
not
care
for
me
now
my
americanized
self
did
not
make
the
favorable
impression
that
i
had
made
four
and
a
half
years
before
when
he
gave
me
my
first
american
i
inquired
after
his
daughter
and
his
but
my
hint
that
the
latter
might
perhaps
be
willing
to
indorse
a
note
for
me
evoked
an
impatient
grunt
my
why
you
do
even
know
him
he
retorted
with
a
suspicious
look
at
me
i
turned
it
off
with
a
joke
and
asked
about
the
man
mr
even
had
not
seen
him
for
four
years
the
other
talmudists
present
had
never
even
known
him
a
man
with
extremely
long
black
who
spoke
with
a
galician
accent
became
interested
after
mr
even
went
to
his
wonted
seat
at
the
east
wall
where
he
took
up
a
book
this
man
said
to
me
with
a
sigh
oh
it
is
not
the
old
home
over
there
people
go
to
the
same
synagogue
all
their
lives
while
here
one
is
constantly
on
the
move
they
call
it
a
city
pshaw
it
is
a
a
bazar
an
inn
not
a
city
people
are
together
for
a
day
and
then
behold
they
have
flown
apart
where
to
nobody
knows
i
do
know
what
has
become
of
you
and
you
do
know
what
has
become
of
me
that
why
there
is
no
real
friendship
here
i
chimed
in
heartily
that
why
one
feels
so
friendless
so
lonely
my
shop
of
course
shut
down
and
i
roamed
about
the
streets
a
good
deal
i
was
restless
i
continually
felt
nonplussed
ashamed
to
look
myself
in
the
face
as
it
were
one
forenoon
i
found
myself
walking
in
the
direction
of
street
and
lexington
avenue
the
college
building
was
now
a
source
of
consolation
indeed
what
was
money
beside
the
halo
of
higher
education
i
paused
in
front
of
the
building
there
were
several
students
on
the
campus
all
jewish
boys
i
accosted
one
of
them
i
spoke
to
him
enviously
and
left
the
place
thrilling
with
a
determination
to
drop
all
thought
of
business
to
take
the
entrance
examination
and
be
a
college
student
at
last
i
was
almost
grateful
to
that
western
firm
for
going
into
bankruptcy
and
yet
even
while
i
was
tingling
with
this
feeling
a
voice
exclaimed
in
my
heart
ah
if
that
western
firm
had
not
failed
the
debt
i
owed
the
american
commission
merchant
agonized
me
without
i
could
help
thinking
of
my
credit
face
to
disappoint
him
of
all
men
seemed
to
be
the
most
brutal
thing
i
had
ever
done
i
imagined
myself
obtaining
just
enough
money
to
pay
him
but
as
i
did
so
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
extending
the
sum
so
as
to
go
on
manufacturing
cloaks
i
was
incessantly
cudgeling
my
brains
for
some
angel
who
would
come
to
my
financial
rescue
the
spell
of
my
college
aspirations
was
broken
once
for
all
my
temple
was
destroyed
nothing
was
left
of
it
but
vague
yearnings
and
something
like
a
feeling
of
compunction
which
will
assert
itself
sometimes
to
this
day
the
talmud
tells
us
how
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
and
the
great
temple
was
caused
by
a
hen
and
a
rooster
the
destruction
of
my
american
temple
was
caused
by
a
bottle
of
milk
the
physical
edifice
still
stands
though
the
college
has
long
since
moved
to
a
much
larger
and
more
imposing
building
or
group
of
buildings
i
find
the
humble
old
structure
on
lexington
avenue
and
street
the
more
dignified
and
the
more
fascinating
of
the
two
to
me
it
is
a
sacred
spot
it
is
the
sepulcher
of
my
dearest
ambitions
a
monument
to
my
noblest
enthusiasm
in
america
book
ix
dora
chapter
i
how
about
it
chaikin
said
to
me
ominously
about
what
what
do
you
mean
mrs
chaikin
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
it
is
no
use
playing
the
fool
and
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
me
the
conversation
was
held
in
our
deserted
shop
on
an
afternoon
the
three
the
and
the
looked
desolate
she
spoke
in
an
undertone
almost
in
a
whisper
lest
the
secret
of
her
husband
relations
with
me
should
leak
out
and
reach
his
employers
she
had
been
guarding
that
secret
all
along
but
now
that
our
undertaking
had
apparently
collapsed
she
was
particularly
uneasy
about
it
i
do
believe
that
store
in
the
west
has
failed
at
all
in
fact
i
know
it
has
not
somebody
told
me
all
about
it
this
was
her
method
of
me
i
read
her
a
clipping
containing
the
news
of
the
bankruptcy
but
as
she
could
not
read
it
herself
she
only
sneered
i
reasoned
with
her
i
pleaded
i
swore
but
she
kept
sneering
or
nodding
her
head
mournfully
i
do
believe
you
i
do
believe
you
she
finally
said
shutting
her
eyes
with
a
gesture
of
despair
and
exhaustion
do
i
believe
a
dog
when
it
barks
neither
do
i
believe
you
i
curse
the
day
when
i
first
met
you
it
was
the
black
year
that
brought
you
to
us
she
fell
to
wringing
her
hands
and
moaning
woe
is
me
woe
is
me
finally
she
tiptoed
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
in
my
despair
i
longed
for
somebody
to
whom
i
could
unbosom
myself
i
thought
of
meyer
nodelman
a
man
and
one
who
had
begun
manufacturing
almost
penniless
like
myself
he
seemed
to
be
just
the
man
i
needed
a
thought
glimmered
through
my
mind
and
who
knows
but
he
may
come
to
my
rescue
i
was
going
to
call
at
his
warehouse
but
upon
second
thought
i
realized
that
the
seat
of
his
cold
would
scarcely
be
a
favorable
setting
for
the
interview
and
that
i
must
try
to
entrap
him
in
the
humanizing
atmosphere
of
his
mother
home
for
the
purpose
the
next
time
i
saw
him
at
his
mother
i
took
him
up
to
my
little
attic
and
laid
my
tribulations
before
him
i
told
him
the
whole
story
almost
without
embellishments
omitting
nothing
but
chaikin
name
is
it
all
true
he
interrupted
me
at
one
point
i
swore
that
it
was
and
went
on
at
the
end
i
offered
to
prove
it
all
to
his
satisfaction
you
do
need
to
prove
it
to
me
he
replied
what
do
i
care
then
suddenly
casting
off
his
reserve
he
blurted
out
look
here
young
fellow
if
you
think
i
am
going
to
lend
you
money
you
are
only
wasting
time
for
i
am
not
and
why
not
i
asked
boldly
with
studied
dignity
why
not
you
better
tell
me
why
yes
he
chuckled
you
have
a
lot
of
spunk
that
you
certainly
have
and
you
ought
to
make
a
good
business
man
but
i
wo
loan
you
money
for
all
that
were
you
once
hard
up
yourself
nodelman
you
have
made
a
success
of
it
and
now
it
would
only
be
right
that
you
should
help
another
fellow
get
up
in
the
world
you
wo
lose
a
cent
by
it
either
i
take
an
oath
on
it
you
ca
have
an
oath
cashed
in
a
bank
can
you
why
did
that
commission
merchant
take
a
chance
if
a
gentile
is
willing
to
help
a
jew
and
one
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
you
should
not
hesitate
either
well
there
is
no
use
talking
about
it
was
his
final
decision
the
following
day
i
received
a
letter
from
him
inviting
me
to
his
office
his
warehouse
occupied
a
vast
loft
on
a
little
street
off
broadway
arrived
there
i
had
to
pass
several
men
all
in
their
who
were
attacking
mountains
of
cloth
with
long
narrow
knives
one
of
these
directed
me
to
a
remote
window
in
front
of
which
i
presently
found
nodelman
lecturing
a
man
who
wore
a
around
his
neck
nodelman
kept
me
waiting
without
offering
me
a
scat
a
good
he
was
in
his
like
the
others
yet
he
looked
far
more
dignified
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
look
before
it
was
as
though
the
environment
of
his
little
kingdom
had
made
another
man
of
him
finally
he
left
the
man
with
the
and
silently
led
me
into
his
little
private
office
a
narrow
strip
of
space
at
the
other
end
of
the
loft
when
we
were
seated
and
the
partition
door
was
shut
he
said
with
grave
mien
well
and
fell
silent
again
i
gazed
at
him
patiently
well
he
repeated
i
have
thought
it
over
and
again
he
paused
at
last
he
burst
out
i
do
want
to
help
you
young
fellow
you
did
expect
it
did
you
i
do
want
to
help
you
and
do
you
know
why
because
otherwise
you
wo
pay
that
gentile
and
i
want
a
gentile
to
think
that
jews
are
a
bad
lot
that
number
one
number
two
is
this
if
you
think
meyer
nodelman
is
a
hog
you
do
know
meyer
nodelman
number
three
i
rather
liked
the
way
you
talked
yesterday
i
said
to
myself
said
i
educated
fellow
who
can
talk
like
that
will
be
all
right
he
ought
to
be
given
a
lift
for
most
educated
people
are
damn
fools
well
i
tell
you
what
i
am
willing
to
do
for
you
i
get
you
the
goods
for
that
order
of
yours
not
for
thirty
days
but
for
sixty
what
do
you
think
of
that
now
is
nodelman
a
hog
or
is
he
not
but
that
as
far
as
i
am
willing
to
go
i
can
only
get
you
the
goods
for
that
third
avenue
order
see
but
that
wo
be
enough
to
help
you
out
of
your
scrape
not
enough
for
you
to
pay
that
good
gentile
on
time
he
engaged
in
some
mental
arithmetic
by
means
of
which
he
reached
the
conclusion
that
i
should
need
an
additional
four
hundred
dollars
and
he
wound
up
by
an
ultimatum
he
would
not
furnish
me
the
goods
until
i
had
produced
that
amount
look
here
young
fellow
he
added
since
you
were
smart
enough
to
get
that
gentile
and
meyer
nodelman
to
help
you
out
it
ought
not
to
be
a
hard
job
for
you
to
get
a
third
fellow
to
take
an
interest
in
you
do
you
remember
what
i
told
you
about
those
credit
faces
i
think
you
have
got
one
i
have
an
honest
heart
too
i
said
with
a
smile
your
heart
i
ca
get
into
so
i
do
know
see
maybe
there
is
a
rogue
hiding
there
and
maybe
there
is
but
your
face
and
your
talk
certainly
are
all
right
they
ought
to
be
able
to
get
you
some
more
cash
and
if
they
do
then
they
do
deserve
that
i
should
help
you
out
either
see
he
chuckled
in
appreciation
of
his
own
syllogism
it
a
nice
piece
of
talmud
reasoning
i
complimented
him
with
an
enthusiastic
laugh
but
seriously
nodelman
i
shall
pay
you
every
cent
you
run
absolutely
no
risk
i
pleaded
with
him
to
grant
me
the
accommodation
unconditionally
i
tried
to
convince
him
that
i
should
contrive
to
do
without
the
additional
cash
but
he
was
obdurate
and
at
last
i
took
my
leave
wait
a
moment
what
your
hurry
are
you
afraid
you
be
a
couple
of
minutes
longer
becoming
a
millionaire
there
is
something
i
want
to
ask
you
what
is
it
mr
nodelman
how
about
your
studying
to
be
a
he
asked
archly
oh
well
one
can
attend
to
business
and
find
time
for
books
too
i
answered
i
came
away
in
a
new
transport
of
expectations
and
in
a
new
agony
of
despair
at
once
on
the
whole
however
my
spirits
were
greatly
buoyed
up
encouraged
by
the
result
of
taking
nodelman
into
my
confidence
i
decided
to
try
a
similar
talk
on
max
margolis
better
known
to
the
reader
as
maximum
max
he
had
some
money
i
had
seen
very
little
of
him
in
the
past
two
years
having
stumbled
upon
him
in
the
street
but
two
or
three
times
but
upon
each
of
these
occasions
he
had
stopped
me
and
inquired
about
my
affairs
with
genuine
interest
he
was
fond
of
me
i
had
no
doubt
about
it
and
he
was
so
our
last
chance
meeting
antedated
my
new
venture
by
at
least
six
months
and
he
was
not
likely
to
have
any
knowledge
of
it
i
felt
that
he
would
be
sincerely
glad
to
hear
of
it
and
i
hoped
that
he
would
be
inclined
to
help
me
launch
it
anyhow
he
seemed
to
be
my
last
resort
and
i
was
determined
to
make
my
appeal
to
him
as
effective
as
i
knew
how
as
he
had
always
seen
me
shabbily
clad
i
decided
to
overwhelm
him
with
a
new
suit
of
clothes
i
needed
one
at
any
rate
after
some
seeking
and
inquiring
i
found
him
in
a
bowery
one
of
the
several
places
from
which
he
supplied
his
instalment
customers
it
was
about
in
the
morning
there
is
something
i
want
to
consult
you
about
max
i
said
something
awfully
important
to
me
you
the
only
man
i
know
who
could
advise
me
and
in
whom
i
can
confide
i
added
with
an
implication
of
great
intimacy
and
affection
it
a
business
scheme
max
i
have
a
chance
to
make
lots
of
money
the
conversation
was
held
in
a
dusky
passage
of
the
labyrinthine
store
a
narrow
lane
running
between
two
barricades
of
furniture
what
is
that
a
business
scheme
he
asked
in
a
preoccupied
tone
of
voice
and
straining
his
eyes
to
look
me
over
you
are
dressed
up
i
see
quite
prosperous
are
you
as
we
emerged
into
the
glare
of
the
bowery
he
scrutinized
my
suit
once
again
i
quailed
i
now
felt
that
to
have
come
in
such
a
screamingly
new
suit
was
a
fatal
mistake
i
cursed
myself
for
an
idiot
of
a
smart
aleck
but
he
spoke
to
me
with
his
usual
cordiality
and
my
spirits
rose
again
however
he
seemed
to
be
busy
and
so
i
asked
him
to
set
an
hour
when
he
could
see
me
at
leisure
we
made
an
appointment
for
in
the
afternoon
i
was
to
meet
him
at
the
same
but
upon
second
thought
and
with
another
glance
at
my
new
clothes
he
said
jovially
why
you
are
rigged
out
like
a
regular
monarch
it
is
quite
an
honor
to
invite
you
to
the
house
come
up
will
you
and
as
i
wo
have
to
go
out
to
meet
you
you
can
make
it
or
half
past
chapter
ii
max
occupied
the
top
floor
of
an
old
private
house
on
henry
street
a
small
railroad
apartment
of
two
large
bright
rooms
a
and
a
kitchen
with
two
small
dark
bedrooms
between
them
the
ceiling
was
low
and
the
air
somewhat
tainted
with
the
odor
of
mold
and
dampness
i
found
max
in
the
general
which
was
also
a
a
fat
boy
of
three
on
his
lap
and
a
slender
pale
girl
of
eight
on
a
chair
close
by
his
wife
a
slender
young
woman
with
a
fine
white
complexion
and
serious
black
eyes
was
clearing
away
the
lunch
things
margolis
levinsky
he
introduced
us
plainly
speaking
this
is
my
wifey
and
this
is
a
friend
of
mine
as
she
was
leaving
the
room
for
the
kitchen
he
called
after
her
dvorah
dora
make
some
tea
will
you
she
craned
her
neck
and
gave
him
a
look
of
resentment
it
a
good
thing
you
are
telling
me
that
she
said
otherwise
i
should
know
what
i
have
got
to
do
should
i
when
she
had
disappeared
he
explained
to
me
that
he
variously
addressed
her
by
the
yiddish
or
english
form
of
her
name
we
are
plain
yiddish
folk
he
generalized
a
few
minutes
later
as
margolis
placed
a
glass
of
russian
tea
before
me
he
drew
her
to
him
and
pinched
her
white
cheek
what
do
you
think
of
my
wifey
levinsky
she
smiled
a
grave
deprecating
smile
and
took
to
pottering
about
the
house
and
what
do
you
think
of
these
little
customers
he
went
on
lucy
examine
mamma
in
spelling
quick
dora
be
a
good
girl
sit
down
and
let
levinsky
see
how
educated
you
are
educated
he
said
in
english
with
the
accent
on
the
a
what
do
you
want
his
wife
protested
softly
levinsky
wants
to
see
you
on
business
and
here
you
are
bothering
him
with
all
sorts
of
nonsense
never
mind
his
business
it
wo
run
away
sit
down
i
say
it
wo
take
long
she
yielded
casting
bashful
at
nobody
in
particular
she
seated
herself
opposite
lucy
well
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
i
thought
her
eyes
looked
too
serious
almost
angry
insane
people
have
eyes
of
this
kind
i
said
to
myself
i
also
made
a
mental
note
of
her
clear
fresh
delicate
complexion
otherwise
she
did
not
interest
me
in
the
least
and
i
mutely
prayed
heaven
to
take
her
out
of
the
room
how
do
you
spell
the
little
girl
demanded
great
her
mother
answered
with
a
smile
book
book
oh
give
me
some
harder
words
laughter
laughter
is
that
correct
margolis
turned
to
me
all
beaming
i
wish
i
could
do
as
much
and
nobody
has
taught
her
either
she
has
learned
it
all
by
herself
little
lucy
is
the
only
teacher
she
ever
had
but
she
will
soon
be
ahead
of
her
wo
she
lucy
i
afraid
i
am
ahead
of
her
already
margolis
said
gaily
yet
flushed
with
excitement
you
are
not
lucy
protested
with
a
pout
shut
up
bad
girl
you
her
mother
retorted
again
with
a
bashful
is
that
the
way
you
talk
to
your
mamma
max
intervened
tell
your
teacher
i
was
on
pins
and
needles
to
be
alone
with
him
and
to
get
down
to
the
object
of
my
visit
finally
he
said
brusquely
well
we
have
had
enough
of
that
leave
us
alone
dora
go
to
the
parlor
and
take
the
kids
along
she
obeyed
when
he
heard
of
my
venture
he
was
interested
he
often
interrupted
me
with
boisterous
expressions
of
admiration
for
my
subterfuges
as
well
as
for
the
plan
as
a
whole
with
all
his
boisterousness
however
there
was
an
air
of
caution
about
him
as
if
he
scented
danger
when
i
finally
said
that
all
depended
upon
my
raising
four
hundred
dollars
his
face
clouded
i
see
i
see
he
murmured
with
sudden
estrangement
i
see
i
see
do
lose
courage
i
said
to
myself
nodelman
was
exactly
like
that
at
first
go
right
ahead
i
portrayed
my
business
prospects
in
the
most
alluring
colors
and
gave
max
to
understand
that
if
somebody
advanced
me
the
four
hundred
dollars
he
would
be
sure
to
get
it
back
in
thirty
days
plus
any
interest
he
might
name
it
would
be
terrible
if
i
had
to
let
it
all
go
to
pieces
on
account
of
such
a
thing
i
concluded
there
was
a
moment
of
very
awkward
silence
it
was
broken
by
max
it
really
too
bad
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
he
said
where
can
you
get
such
a
i
do
know
that
why
i
came
to
consult
you
i
thought
you
might
suggest
some
way
it
would
be
a
pity
if
i
had
to
give
it
all
up
on
account
of
four
hundred
dollars
indeed
it
would
it
would
be
terrible
still
four
hundred
dollars
is
not
four
hundred
cents
i
wish
i
were
a
rich
man
i
should
lend
it
to
you
at
once
you
know
i
should
i
should
pay
you
every
cent
of
it
max
you
say
it
as
if
i
had
money
you
know
i
have
not
what
i
did
know
was
that
he
had
and
he
knew
that
i
did
he
took
to
analyzing
the
situation
and
offering
me
advice
why
not
go
to
that
kindly
gentile
the
commission
merchant
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
obtain
an
extension
of
time
why
not
apply
to
some
why
not
make
a
vigorous
appeal
to
nodelman
he
seemed
to
be
an
obliging
fellow
so
if
i
pressed
him
a
little
harder
he
might
give
me
the
cash
as
well
as
the
goods
i
was
impelled
to
retort
that
advice
was
cheap
and
he
apparently
read
my
thoughts
presently
he
said
with
genuine
ardor
i
tell
you
what
levinsky
why
not
try
to
get
your
old
landlady
to
open
her
stocking
from
what
you
have
told
me
she
ought
not
to
be
a
hard
nut
to
crack
if
you
only
go
about
it
in
the
right
way
this
suggestion
made
a
certain
appeal
to
me
but
i
would
not
betray
it
i
continued
resentfully
silent
you
just
try
her
levinsky
she
let
you
have
the
four
hundred
dollars
or
half
of
it
at
least
and
if
she
does
her
son
will
refuse
to
get
me
the
goods
i
remarked
with
a
sneer
nonsense
if
you
know
how
to
handle
her
she
will
realize
that
she
must
keep
her
mouth
shut
until
after
she
gets
the
money
back
oh
what
the
use
i
said
impatiently
i
must
get
the
cash
at
once
or
all
is
lost
again
he
spoke
of
he
went
into
details
about
one
of
them
and
offered
to
ascertain
his
address
for
me
he
evidently
felt
awkward
about
his
part
in
the
matter
and
eager
to
atone
for
it
in
some
way
why
should
a
usurer
trust
me
i
said
rising
to
go
wait
what
your
hurry
if
that
hears
your
story
he
may
trust
you
he
is
a
peculiar
fellow
do
you
know
when
he
takes
a
fancy
to
a
man
he
is
willing
to
take
a
chance
on
him
of
course
the
interest
would
be
rather
high
he
paused
abruptly
wrinkled
his
forehead
with
an
effect
of
pondering
some
new
scheme
and
said
wait
i
think
i
have
a
better
plan
i
see
if
i
ca
get
you
the
money
without
a
with
this
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
had
his
wife
bring
him
his
coat
and
hat
i
be
back
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
said
dvorah
dear
give
levinsky
some
more
tea
will
you
i
am
going
out
for
a
few
minutes
do
let
him
be
downhearted
then
shaking
a
finger
of
warning
at
me
he
said
playfully
only
take
care
that
you
fall
in
love
with
her
and
he
was
gone
it
all
i
thought
he
just
wants
me
to
believe
he
is
trying
to
do
something
for
me
but
of
course
i
was
not
altogether
devoid
of
hope
that
i
was
mistaken
and
that
he
was
making
a
sincere
effort
to
raise
a
loan
for
me
margolis
went
into
the
kitchen
immediately
her
husband
departed
presently
she
came
back
carrying
a
glass
of
tea
on
a
saucer
she
placed
it
before
me
with
an
embarrassed
brought
some
cookies
and
seated
herself
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
i
uttered
some
complimentary
trivialities
about
the
children
when
a
man
finds
himself
alone
with
a
woman
who
is
neither
his
wife
nor
a
close
relative
both
feel
awkward
it
is
as
though
they
heard
a
whisper
there
is
nobody
to
watch
the
two
of
you
still
confused
as
i
was
i
was
fully
aware
of
her
tempting
complexion
and
found
her
angry
black
eyes
strangely
interesting
upon
the
whole
however
i
do
not
think
she
made
any
appeal
to
me
save
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
she
was
a
woman
and
that
we
were
alone
i
was
tense
with
the
consciousness
of
that
fact
and
everything
about
her
disturbed
me
she
wore
a
summer
wrapper
and
i
noticed
the
way
it
set
off
the
soft
whiteness
of
her
neck
i
remarked
to
myself
that
she
looked
younger
than
her
husband
that
she
must
be
about
or
thirty
perhaps
my
glances
apparently
caused
her
painful
embarrassment
finally
she
got
up
again
making
a
pretense
of
bustling
about
the
room
it
seemed
to
me
that
when
she
was
on
her
feet
she
looked
younger
than
when
she
was
seated
i
asked
the
boy
his
name
and
he
answered
in
lugubrious
but
distinct
accents
daniel
margolis
he
speaks
like
a
grown
person
i
said
she
used
to
speak
like
that
too
when
she
was
of
his
age
my
hostess
replied
with
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
her
daughter
did
you
i
said
to
lucy
the
little
girl
grinned
coyly
why
do
you
answer
the
gentleman
question
her
mother
rebuked
her
in
english
it
levinsky
a
friend
of
papa
lucy
gave
me
a
long
stare
and
lost
all
interest
in
me
do
you
like
me
at
all
not
even
a
little
bit
i
pleaded
she
soon
unbent
and
took
to
plying
me
with
questions
where
did
i
live
was
i
a
customer
peddler
like
her
papa
how
long
had
i
been
in
america
a
question
which
a
child
of
the
east
side
hears
as
often
as
it
does
queries
about
the
weather
can
you
spell
no
i
answered
not
at
all
not
at
all
shame
but
my
papa
ca
spell
neither
shut
up
you
bad
girl
you
her
mother
broke
in
with
a
laugh
vere
you
such
nasty
things
by
your
mamma
the
gentleman
will
think
by
your
mamma
she
delivered
her
a
little
lecture
in
english
taking
pains
to
produce
the
th
and
the
american
r
though
her
w
were
v
she
urged
me
not
to
let
the
tea
get
cold
as
i
took
hold
of
the
tall
thin
cylindrical
glass
i
noted
that
it
was
scrupulously
clean
and
that
its
contents
had
a
good
clear
color
i
threw
a
glance
around
the
room
and
i
saw
that
it
was
well
kept
and
tidy
margolis
took
a
seat
again
lucy
with
part
of
a
cooky
in
her
mouth
stepped
over
to
her
and
seated
herself
on
her
lap
throwing
her
arm
around
her
she
struck
me
as
the
very
image
of
her
mother
presently
however
i
discovered
that
she
resembled
her
father
quite
as
closely
it
seemed
as
though
the
one
likeness
lay
on
the
surface
of
her
face
while
the
other
loomed
up
from
underneath
as
the
reflection
of
a
face
does
from
under
the
surface
of
water
lucy
soon
wearied
of
her
mother
and
walked
over
to
my
side
i
put
her
on
my
lap
she
would
not
let
me
pat
her
but
she
did
not
mind
sitting
on
my
knees
are
you
a
good
speller
i
asked
i
spell
all
the
words
we
get
at
school
she
answered
sagely
how
do
you
spell
we
never
got
it
at
school
but
you
ca
spell
it
either
how
do
you
know
i
ca
maybe
i
can
well
let
us
take
an
easier
word
how
do
you
spell
she
spelled
it
correctly
her
mother
joining
in
playfully
i
gave
them
other
words
addressing
myself
to
both
and
they
made
a
race
of
it
each
trying
to
head
off
or
outshout
the
other
at
first
margolis
did
so
with
feigned
gaiety
but
her
face
soon
set
into
a
grave
look
and
glowed
with
excitement
at
last
i
asked
them
to
spell
coefficient
we
never
got
it
at
school
lucy
demurred
i
do
know
what
it
means
said
margolis
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
it
means
something
in
mathematics
in
high
figuring
i
explained
in
yiddish
margolis
shrugged
her
shoulders
once
more
i
asked
lucy
to
try
me
in
spelling
she
did
and
i
acquitted
myself
so
well
that
she
exclaimed
oh
you
liar
you
why
did
you
say
you
did
know
how
to
spell
once
more
her
mother
took
her
to
task
for
her
manners
is
that
the
vay
to
talk
to
a
gentleman
shame
vere
you
up
to
be
such
a
pig
not
by
your
mamma
when
max
came
back
lucy
hastened
to
inform
him
that
i
could
spell
awful
good
to
which
he
replied
in
yiddish
that
he
knew
i
was
a
smart
fellow
that
i
could
read
and
write
everything
and
that
i
had
studied
to
go
to
college
and
to
be
a
doctor
a
lawyer
or
anything
his
wife
looked
me
over
with
bashful
really
she
said
max
told
me
a
lame
story
about
his
errand
and
promised
to
let
me
know
the
final
result
it
was
clearer
than
ever
to
me
that
he
was
making
a
fool
of
me
chapter
iii
when
i
hear
a
new
melody
and
it
makes
an
appeal
to
me
its
effect
usually
lasts
only
as
long
as
i
hear
it
but
it
is
almost
sure
to
reassert
itself
later
on
i
scarcely
ever
think
of
it
during
the
first
two
three
or
four
days
but
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
will
pop
up
in
my
brain
and
haunt
me
a
few
days
in
succession
humming
itself
and
nagging
me
like
a
living
thing
this
was
precisely
what
happened
to
me
with
regard
to
margolis
during
the
first
two
days
after
i
left
her
house
i
never
gave
her
a
thought
but
on
the
third
her
shy
suddenly
loomed
up
in
my
mind
and
would
not
leave
it
just
her
black
serious
eyes
and
those
shy
looks
of
theirs
gleaming
out
of
a
white
strikingly
interesting
complexion
her
face
in
general
was
a
mere
blur
in
my
memory
i
was
incessantly
racking
my
brain
over
my
affairs
i
was
so
and
worried
that
i
was
unconscious
of
the
food
i
ate
or
of
the
streets
through
which
i
passed
yet
her
manner
of
darting
embarrassed
glances
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
and
her
complexion
were
never
absent
from
my
mind
i
felt
like
seeing
her
once
more
however
the
prospect
of
calling
at
her
house
was
now
anything
but
alluring
i
could
almost
see
the
annoyed
air
with
which
her
husband
would
receive
me
i
sought
out
two
usurers
and
begged
each
of
them
to
grant
me
the
loan
but
they
unyieldingly
insisted
on
more
substantial
security
than
the
bare
story
or
my
venture
i
made
other
efforts
to
raise
the
money
i
approached
several
people
including
the
proprietor
of
the
little
all
to
no
purpose
one
afternoon
eight
or
ten
days
after
my
call
at
the
margolises
when
i
came
to
my
factory
i
found
under
the
door
a
closed
envelope
bearing
the
name
of
that
western
firm
it
contained
a
typewritten
letter
and
a
check
in
full
payment
of
my
bill
also
a
circular
explaining
that
the
firm
had
been
reorganized
with
plenty
of
capital
and
naming
as
one
of
its
new
directors
a
man
who
from
the
tone
of
the
circular
seemed
to
be
of
high
standing
in
the
financial
world
my
head
was
in
a
whirl
the
of
my
deserted
shop
seemed
to
have
suddenly
brightened
up
i
looked
at
the
check
again
and
again
the
figure
on
it
literally
staggered
me
it
seemed
to
be
part
of
a
fairy
tale
i
rushed
over
to
nodelman
office
but
found
him
gone
for
the
day
the
next
thing
on
my
program
was
to
carry
the
glad
news
to
the
chaikins
and
to
discuss
plans
for
the
immediate
future
with
my
partner
but
chaikin
never
came
home
before
so
i
first
dropped
in
on
the
margolises
to
flash
my
check
in
max
face
and
incidentally
to
see
his
wife
i
found
him
playing
with
his
fat
boy
hello
max
i
have
good
news
i
shouted
excitedly
which
actually
meant
do
be
uneasy
max
i
am
not
going
to
ask
you
for
a
loan
again
when
he
had
examined
the
check
he
said
sheepishly
now
you
are
all
right
why
something
told
me
all
along
that
you
would
get
it
his
wife
came
in
apparently
from
the
kitchen
she
returned
my
good
evening
with
free
and
easy
amiability
without
any
shyness
or
and
disappeared
again
i
felt
annoyed
i
was
tempted
to
call
after
her
to
come
back
and
let
me
take
a
good
look
at
her
say
levinsky
you
must
have
thought
i
would
not
trust
you
for
the
four
hundred
dollars
max
said
may
i
have
four
hundred
days
of
distress
if
i
have
a
cent
what
few
dollars
i
do
have
is
buried
in
the
business
so
help
me
god
let
a
few
of
my
customers
stop
paying
and
i
would
have
to
go
begging
it
the
real
truth
i
am
telling
you
honest
i
know
i
know
i
said
awkwardly
well
it
was
as
if
the
check
had
dropped
from
heaven
thank
god
now
i
can
begin
to
do
things
i
went
over
the
main
facts
of
my
venture
this
time
with
a
touch
of
bluster
and
he
listened
with
far
readier
attention
and
more
genuine
interest
than
he
had
done
on
the
previous
occasion
we
discussed
my
plans
and
my
prospects
at
one
point
when
i
referred
to
the
western
check
he
asked
to
see
it
again
just
for
curiosity
sake
and
as
i
watched
him
look
it
over
i
could
almost
see
the
change
that
it
was
producing
in
his
attitude
toward
me
i
do
not
know
to
what
extent
he
had
previously
believed
my
story
if
at
all
one
thing
was
clear
the
magic
check
now
made
it
all
real
to
him
as
he
handed
me
back
the
strip
of
paper
he
gave
me
a
look
that
seemed
to
say
so
you
are
a
manufacturer
you
whom
i
have
always
known
as
a
miserable
ragamuffin
margolis
reappeared
her
husband
told
her
of
my
great
check
and
she
returned
some
trivialities
as
we
thus
chatted
i
made
a
mental
note
of
the
fascinating
feminine
texture
of
her
flesh
he
made
me
stay
to
supper
it
was
a
cheery
repast
as
though
to
make
amends
for
his
failure
to
respond
when
i
knocked
at
his
door
max
overwhelmed
me
with
attention
we
were
eating
cold
sorrel
soup
prepared
in
the
old
ghetto
way
with
cream
bits
of
boiled
egg
cucumber
and
scallions
how
do
you
like
it
he
asked
delicious
and
the
genuine
article
too
genuine
article
he
mocked
me
what
the
use
praising
it
when
you
eat
it
like
a
bird
what
the
matter
with
you
are
you
bashful
fire
away
old
man
then
to
his
wife
why
do
you
keep
quiet
dvorah
why
do
you
tell
him
to
eat
like
a
man
and
not
like
a
bird
maybe
he
does
care
for
my
cooking
she
jested
demurely
why
why
i
replied
the
sorrel
soup
is
fit
for
a
king
you
mean
for
a
president
max
corrected
me
we
are
in
america
not
in
europe
how
do
you
know
the
president
of
the
united
states
would
care
for
a
plate
of
cold
sorrel
soup
and
how
do
you
know
a
king
would
if
you
care
for
it
i
am
satisfied
the
hostess
said
to
me
i
certainly
do
i
have
eaten
anything
like
it
since
i
left
home
i
replied
feed
him
well
dvorah
now
is
your
chance
he
will
soon
be
a
millionaire
do
you
know
then
he
wo
bother
about
calling
on
poor
people
like
us
but
i
have
said
the
sorrel
soup
is
fit
for
a
king
and
a
king
has
many
millions
i
rejoined
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
come
provided
lucy
and
dannie
have
no
objection
you
remember
their
names
do
you
margolis
said
beamingly
you
certainly
have
a
good
memory
who
else
should
have
one
her
husband
chimed
in
i
have
told
you
he
was
going
to
study
to
be
a
doctor
or
a
lawyer
lucy
did
you
hear
what
uncle
said
if
you
let
him
in
he
will
come
to
see
us
even
when
he
is
worth
a
million
what
do
you
say
will
you
let
him
in
lucy
grinned
childishly
max
did
most
of
the
talking
he
entertained
me
with
stories
of
some
curious
weddings
which
he
said
had
recently
been
celebrated
in
his
and
as
usual
it
was
not
easy
to
draw
a
line
of
demarkation
between
fact
and
fiction
of
one
bridegroom
who
had
agreed
to
the
marriage
under
threats
of
violence
from
the
girl
father
he
said
you
should
have
seen
the
fellow
he
looked
like
a
man
going
to
the
electric
chair
they
were
afraid
he
might
bolt
so
the
bride
father
and
brother
big
strapping
fellows
both
stuck
to
him
like
two
detectives
had
better
not
make
monkey
business
they
said
to
him
you
want
a
wedding
you
have
a
funeral
that
exactly
what
they
said
to
him
i
was
standing
close
to
them
and
i
heard
it
with
my
own
ears
may
i
not
live
till
if
i
did
not
margolis
looked
down
shamefacedly
she
certainly
was
not
unaware
of
her
husband
failing
and
she
obviously
took
anything
but
pride
in
it
as
i
glanced
at
her
face
at
this
moment
it
struck
me
as
a
singularly
truthful
face
those
eyes
of
hers
do
not
express
anger
but
integrity
i
said
to
myself
and
the
more
i
looked
at
her
watched
her
gestures
and
listened
to
her
voice
the
stronger
grew
my
impression
that
she
was
a
ingenuous
woman
incapable
of
playing
a
part
her
mannerisms
were
mostly
her
version
of
manners
and
those
that
were
not
were
frankly
affected
as
it
were
the
meal
over
and
the
dishes
washed
margolis
caused
lucy
to
bring
her
school
reader
and
began
to
read
it
aloud
lucy
or
i
correcting
her
pronunciation
where
it
was
faulty
she
was
frankly
parading
her
intellectual
achievements
before
me
and
i
could
see
that
she
took
them
quite
seriously
she
was
very
sensitive
about
the
mistakes
she
made
she
accepted
our
corrections
lucy
and
mine
with
great
earnestness
often
with
a
gesture
of
annoyance
and
mortification
at
the
failure
of
her
memory
when
i
bade
them
good
night
max
said
heartily
in
english
call
again
levinsky
and
he
added
in
a
mixture
of
english
and
yiddish
do
be
a
stranger
even
if
you
are
a
manufacturer
call
again
his
wife
echoed
affably
call
again
shouted
dannie
in
his
funereal
voice
i
left
with
the
comfortable
feeling
of
having
spent
an
hour
or
two
in
a
house
where
i
was
sincerely
welcome
it
a
good
thing
to
have
real
friends
i
soliloquized
in
a
transport
of
good
spirits
on
my
way
to
the
elevated
station
now
i
feel
all
alone
in
the
world
there
is
at
least
one
house
where
i
can
call
and
feel
at
home
i
beheld
margolis
face
and
her
slender
figure
and
i
was
conscious
of
a
remote
desire
to
see
her
again
i
was
in
high
feather
while
the
elevated
train
was
carrying
me
i
visioned
an
avalanche
of
new
orders
for
my
shop
and
a
spacious
factory
full
of
machines
and
men
i
saw
myself
building
up
a
great
business
an
ugly
thought
flashed
through
my
mind
why
be
saddled
with
a
partner
why
not
get
rid
of
chaikin
i
belittled
the
part
which
his
samples
had
played
in
my
successful
start
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
cruel
injustice
to
myself
to
share
my
fortune
with
a
man
who
had
no
more
brains
than
a
cat
but
i
instantly
saw
the
other
side
of
the
situation
it
was
models
that
had
made
the
manheimers
what
they
were
and
if
i
clung
to
him
until
he
could
afford
to
let
me
announce
him
as
my
partner
the
very
news
of
it
would
be
a
tremendous
boost
for
my
factory
and
then
i
had
a
real
qualm
of
compunction
for
having
entertained
that
thought
even
for
a
single
moment
my
heart
warmed
to
chaikin
and
his
family
i
shall
be
faithful
to
them
i
vowed
inwardly
they
have
been
so
good
to
me
we
must
be
absolutely
devoted
to
each
other
their
house
too
will
be
like
a
home
to
me
oh
it
is
so
sweet
to
have
friends
real
friends
it
was
close
upon
when
i
reached
the
chaikins
flat
in
harlem
i
had
barely
closed
the
door
behind
me
when
i
whipped
out
the
check
and
dangling
it
before
chaikin
i
said
radiantly
good
evening
guess
what
it
is
the
check
you
expected
from
your
uncle
or
cousin
or
whatever
he
is
to
you
is
it
she
conjectured
no
it
something
far
better
i
replied
it
a
check
from
the
western
company
and
for
the
full
amount
too
and
although
i
was
fairly
on
the
road
to
atheism
i
exclaimed
with
a
thrill
of
genuine
pity
oh
god
has
been
good
to
us
mrs
chaikin
i
let
her
see
the
figures
which
she
could
scarcely
make
out
then
her
husband
took
a
look
at
the
check
he
did
know
something
about
figures
so
he
read
the
sum
out
aloud
instead
of
hailing
it
with
joy
as
i
had
expected
her
to
do
she
said
to
me
glumly
and
how
do
we
know
that
you
did
not
receive
more
but
that
was
the
bill
her
husband
put
in
i
am
not
asking
you
am
i
she
disciplined
him
but
it
is
the
amount
on
the
bill
i
said
with
a
smile
and
how
do
we
know
that
it
is
she
demanded
it
you
who
write
the
bills
and
it
you
who
get
the
checks
what
do
we
know
chaikin
mrs
chaikin
i
remonstrated
why
should
you
be
so
suspicious
ca
you
see
that
i
am
the
most
devoted
friend
you
people
ever
had
god
has
blessed
us
we
are
making
a
success
of
our
business
so
we
must
be
devoted
to
one
another
while
here
you
imagine
all
kinds
of
nonsense
a
woman
will
be
a
woman
chaikin
muttered
with
his
sheepish
smile
the
unfeigned
ardor
of
my
plea
produced
an
impression
on
chaikin
still
she
insisted
upon
receiving
her
husband
share
of
the
profits
at
once
in
spot
cash
i
argued
again
why
of
course
you
are
going
to
get
your
share
of
the
profits
i
said
genially
of
course
you
are
only
we
must
first
pay
for
the
goods
of
those
five
hundred
coats
and
for
some
other
things
must
we
then
too
there
is
that
other
order
to
fill
we
need
more
goods
and
cash
for
wages
and
rent
and
other
expenses
but
you
said
you
were
going
to
get
it
all
yourself
and
now
you
want
us
to
pay
for
it
you
think
you
are
smart
do
you
her
husband
opened
his
mouth
but
she
waved
it
shut
before
she
had
any
idea
what
he
wanted
to
say
anybody
could
fool
you
she
said
a
fool
goes
shopping
there
is
rejoicing
among
the
shopkeepers
with
our
joint
efforts
we
finally
managed
to
placate
her
however
and
the
next
evening
our
shop
was
the
scene
of
feverish
activity
chapter
iv
i
filled
my
third
avenue
order
and
went
on
soliciting
other
business
the
season
was
waning
but
i
obtained
a
number
of
small
orders
and
laid
foundations
for
future
sales
our
capital
was
growing
apace
but
we
often
lacked
working
cash
after
i
paid
the
debt
i
owed
meyer
nodelman
i
obtained
other
favors
from
him
he
took
a
sponsorial
interest
in
my
business
and
often
offered
me
the
benefit
of
his
commercial
experience
in
the
form
of
maxims
do
bite
off
more
than
you
can
chew
levinsky
he
would
tell
me
finding
it
easy
to
get
people
to
trust
you
is
not
enough
you
must
also
find
it
easy
to
pay
them
some
of
his
other
rules
were
be
pleasant
with
the
man
you
deal
with
even
if
he
knows
you
do
mean
it
he
likes
it
anyway
take
it
from
me
levinsky
honesty
is
the
best
policy
there
is
only
one
line
of
business
in
which
dishonesty
pays
the
burglar
business
provided
the
burglar
does
not
get
caught
if
i
thought
lying
could
help
my
business
i
should
lie
day
and
night
but
i
have
learned
that
it
hurts
far
more
than
it
helps
be
sure
that
the
other
fellow
believes
what
you
say
if
you
have
his
confidence
you
have
him
by
the
throat
it
was
not
always
easy
to
comply
with
meyer
tenets
however
the
inadequacy
of
my
working
capital
often
forced
me
to
have
recourse
to
subterfuges
that
could
not
exactly
be
called
honorable
one
day
when
we
had
some
bills
to
meet
two
days
before
i
could
expect
to
obtain
the
cash
i
made
out
and
signed
checks
but
inclosed
each
of
them
in
the
wrong
envelope
this
supposed
act
of
inadvertence
gaining
me
the
needed
two
days
of
grace
on
another
occasion
i
sent
out
a
number
of
checks
without
my
signature
which
presumably
i
had
forgotten
to
affix
there
were
instances
when
i
was
so
hard
pressed
for
funds
that
the
fate
of
our
factory
hinged
on
or
a
hundred
dollars
in
one
of
these
crises
i
bought
two
gold
watches
on
the
instalment
plan
for
the
express
and
sole
purpose
of
pawning
them
for
fifty
dollars
i
bought
the
watches
of
two
men
who
did
not
know
each
other
and
returned
them
as
soon
as
i
could
spare
the
cash
to
redeem
them
forfeiting
the
several
weekly
payments
which
i
had
made
on
the
pretended
purchases
there
were
instances
too
when
i
had
to
borrow
of
my
employees
a
few
dollars
with
which
to
buy
cotton
needless
to
say
that
all
this
happened
in
the
early
stages
of
my
experience
as
a
manufacturer
i
have
long
since
been
above
and
beyond
such
methods
indeed
business
honor
and
business
dignity
are
often
a
luxury
in
which
only
those
in
the
front
ranks
of
success
can
indulge
but
then
there
are
features
of
the
game
in
which
the
small
man
is
apt
to
be
more
honorable
and
less
cruel
than
the
financial
magnate
i
was
continually
consulting
max
on
my
affairs
not
that
i
needed
his
advice
or
expected
to
act
upon
it
these
confidential
talks
seemed
to
promote
our
intimacy
and
to
enhance
the
security
of
the
welcome
i
found
in
his
house
a
great
immigrant
city
like
new
york
or
chicago
is
full
of
men
and
women
who
are
alone
amid
a
welter
of
human
life
for
these
nothing
has
a
greater
glamour
than
a
family
in
whose
house
they
might
be
made
to
feel
at
home
i
was
one
of
these
desolate
souls
i
still
missed
my
mother
the
anniversary
of
her
death
was
still
a
feast
of
longing
agony
and
spiritual
bliss
to
me
i
scarcely
ever
visited
the
synagogue
of
the
sons
of
antomir
these
days
but
on
that
great
day
i
was
sure
to
be
there
forgetful
of
my
atheism
i
would
place
a
huge
candle
for
her
soul
attend
all
the
three
services
without
omitting
a
line
and
recite
the
prayer
for
the
dead
with
sobs
in
my
heart
i
had
craved
some
family
who
would
show
me
warm
friendship
the
margolises
were
such
a
family
meyer
nodelman
never
invited
me
to
his
house
they
were
a
godsend
to
me
max
was
essentially
a
hospitable
man
and
really
fond
of
me
as
for
his
wife
who
received
me
with
the
same
hearty
welcome
as
he
her
liking
for
me
was
primarily
based
as
she
once
put
it
herself
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
upon
my
intellectual
qualifications
it
good
to
have
educated
people
come
to
the
house
she
remarked
it
good
for
the
children
and
for
everybody
else
i
knew
she
would
like
you
max
said
to
me
she
would
give
her
head
for
education
only
better
look
out
you
two
see
that
you
do
fall
in
love
with
each
other
ha
ha
sometimes
there
were
other
visitors
in
the
house
some
of
friends
his
and
her
her
relatives
or
some
neighbor
dora
great
friend
was
a
stout
woman
with
flaxen
hair
and
fishy
eyes
named
sadie
or
shornik
whose
little
girl
beckie
was
a
classmate
of
lucy
the
acquaintance
and
devoted
intimacy
of
the
two
mothers
having
originated
in
the
intimacy
of
the
two
sadie
lived
several
blocks
from
the
margolises
but
she
absolutely
never
let
a
day
pass
without
calling
on
her
if
it
were
only
for
just
time
enough
to
kiss
her
she
was
infatuated
with
dora
and
beckie
was
infatuated
with
lucy
they
just
could
live
without
one
another
max
said
after
introducing
me
to
sadie
and
explaining
the
situation
suppose
lucy
and
beckie
had
not
happened
to
be
in
the
same
school
i
jested
addressing
myself
to
the
two
women
what
would
you
have
done
then
this
shows
that
we
have
a
good
god
in
heaven
sadie
returned
radiantly
he
put
the
children
in
the
same
school
so
that
we
might
meet
providential
match
i
observed
may
it
last
for
many
many
years
sadie
returned
devoutly
say
women
max
shouted
you
have
been
more
than
five
minutes
without
kissing
what
the
matter
with
you
at
this
sadie
with
mock
defiance
walked
up
to
margolis
threw
her
arms
around
her
and
gave
her
a
luscious
smack
on
the
lips
bravo
and
now
you
kids
max
commanded
with
a
merry
chuckle
the
two
little
girls
flew
into
each
arms
and
kissed
lucy
had
dark
hair
like
dora
and
beckie
flaxen
hair
like
sadie
so
when
their
heads
were
close
together
they
were
an
amusing
reduced
copy
of
their
mothers
as
these
had
looked
embracing
and
kissing
a
minute
before
max
often
dropped
in
to
see
me
at
my
factory
and
when
i
was
not
busy
we
would
talk
of
my
cloaks
of
his
instalment
business
or
of
women
women
were
his
great
topic
of
conversation
as
usual
but
then
these
talks
of
his
no
longer
found
a
ready
listener
in
me
now
that
i
knew
his
wife
they
jarred
on
me
a
decided
change
had
come
over
me
in
this
respect
i
remember
it
vividly
it
was
as
if
his
lewd
discourses
desecrated
her
name
and
thereby
offended
me
it
may
be
interesting
to
note
however
that
he
never
took
up
this
kind
of
topics
when
we
were
in
his
house
not
even
when
his
wife
was
out
sometimes
i
would
have
supper
at
his
house
more
often
however
usually
on
monday
when
max
seldom
went
to
the
i
would
come
after
supper
and
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
there
sometimes
the
shorniks
would
drop
in
sadie
her
husband
and
beckie
ben
shornik
and
max
would
play
a
game
of
pinochle
while
i
who
never
cared
for
cards
would
chat
with
the
women
or
entertain
them
by
entertaining
the
children
ben
as
i
came
into
the
habit
of
calling
him
was
a
spare
little
man
with
an
extremely
high
forehead
he
was
an
and
only
one
degree
less
illiterate
than
max
but
because
he
had
the
forehead
of
a
learned
man
and
because
it
was
his
business
to
go
from
house
to
house
with
a
long
thick
book
under
his
arm
he
affected
longish
hair
flowing
black
neckties
and
a
certain
pomposity
of
manner
one
of
his
ways
of
being
tremendously
american
was
to
snap
his
fingers
ferociously
and
to
say
i
care
a
continental
or
one
two
three
and
there
you
are
the
latter
exclamation
he
would
be
continually
murmuring
to
himself
when
he
was
absorbed
in
pinochle
chapter
v
one
evening
when
the
shorniks
and
i
were
at
max
house
and
max
and
ben
were
having
their
game
of
pinochle
the
conversation
between
the
women
and
myself
turned
upon
dora
efforts
to
obtain
education
through
her
little
daughter
encouraged
by
sadie
and
myself
dora
let
herself
loose
and
told
us
much
of
lucy
history
or
rather
of
her
own
history
as
mother
in
her
crude
lumbering
way
and
with
flushed
cheeks
she
talked
with
profound
frankness
and
quaint
introspective
insight
in
the
manner
of
one
touching
upon
things
that
are
enshined
in
innermost
recesses
of
one
soul
she
depicted
the
thrills
of
joyous
surprise
with
which
she
had
watched
lucy
in
her
infancy
master
the
beginnings
of
speech
sometimes
her
delight
would
be
accompanied
by
something
akin
to
fright
there
had
been
moments
when
it
all
seemed
unreal
and
weird
the
little
thing
seemed
to
be
a
stranger
to
me
she
said
or
else
she
did
not
seem
to
be
a
human
being
at
all
the
next
moment
she
would
recognize
her
as
it
were
and
then
she
would
kiss
and
yearn
over
her
in
a
mad
rush
of
passion
the
day
when
she
took
lucy
to
school
about
two
years
before
was
one
of
the
greatest
days
in
dora
life
she
would
then
watch
her
learn
to
associate
written
signs
with
spoken
words
as
she
had
once
watched
her
learn
to
speak
but
that
was
not
all
she
became
jealous
of
the
child
she
herself
had
never
been
taught
to
read
even
hebrew
or
yiddish
much
less
a
gentile
language
while
here
lo
and
behold
her
little
girl
possessed
a
gentile
book
and
was
learning
to
read
it
she
was
getting
education
her
child
just
like
the
daughter
of
the
landlord
of
the
house
in
russia
in
which
dora
had
grown
up
cat
lucy
would
spell
out
rat
mat
and
poor
dora
would
watch
the
performance
with
mixed
joy
and
envy
and
exclamations
like
what
do
you
think
of
that
snip
of
a
thing
did
you
ever
lucy
achievements
stirred
a
novel
feeling
of
rivalry
in
dora
breast
when
the
little
girl
could
spell
half
a
dozen
english
words
she
hated
herself
for
her
inferiority
to
her
the
idea
of
that
kitten
getting
ahead
of
me
why
it
worried
the
life
out
of
me
she
said
you
may
think
it
foolish
but
i
help
it
i
kept
saying
to
myself
grow
up
and
be
an
educated
american
lady
and
she
be
ashamed
to
walk
in
the
street
with
me
do
we
see
things
like
that
people
will
beggar
themselves
to
send
their
children
to
college
only
to
be
treated
as
fools
and
greenhorns
by
them
i
call
that
terrible
do
you
well
i
am
not
going
to
let
my
child
treat
me
like
that
not
i
should
commit
suicide
first
i
want
my
child
to
respect
me
not
to
look
down
on
me
if
she
reads
a
book
she
is
to
bear
in
mind
that
her
mother
is
no
ignorant
slouch
of
a
greenhorn
either
a
neighbor
a
woman
who
could
read
english
would
help
lucy
with
her
spelling
lesson
of
an
evening
this
seemed
to
have
established
special
relations
between
the
child
and
that
woman
from
which
dora
was
excluded
she
made
up
her
mind
to
learn
to
read
if
lucy
could
manage
it
she
her
mother
could
so
she
caused
the
child
to
teach
her
to
spell
out
words
in
her
first
reader
at
first
she
pretended
to
treat
it
as
a
joke
but
inwardly
she
took
it
seriously
from
the
very
outset
and
later
under
the
intoxicating
effect
of
the
progress
she
was
achieving
these
studies
became
the
great
passion
of
her
life
whenever
lucy
recited
some
new
lines
learned
at
school
she
would
not
rest
until
she
too
had
learned
them
by
heart
here
are
two
pieces
which
she
proudly
recited
to
us
the
snow
is
white
the
sky
is
blue
the
sun
is
bright
and
so
are
you
our
ears
were
made
to
hear
our
tongues
were
made
to
talk
our
eyes
were
made
to
see
our
feet
were
made
to
walk
her
voice
as
she
declaimed
the
lines
attracted
lucy
attention
so
she
sent
her
and
beckie
into
the
kitchen
she
does
know
what
a
treasure
she
is
to
me
she
said
to
us
then
after
she
finished
the
two
verses
she
remarked
wistfully
well
my
own
life
is
lost
but
she
shall
be
educated
why
why
should
you
talk
like
that
dora
sadie
protested
her
fishy
eyes
full
of
tragedy
why
you
are
only
beginning
to
live
of
course
she
is
i
chimed
in
well
dora
rejoined
anyhow
i
am
afraid
i
love
her
too
much
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
i
am
going
crazy
over
her
i
love
dannie
too
of
course
when
he
happens
to
hurt
a
finger
or
to
hit
his
dear
little
head
against
something
i
ca
sleep
is
he
not
my
flesh
and
blood
like
lucy
still
lucy
is
different
she
paused
and
then
rose
from
her
seat
saying
with
a
smile
wait
i
am
going
to
show
you
something
she
went
into
the
kitchen
and
came
back
holding
a
in
either
hand
guess
what
it
is
two
i
answered
with
perplexed
gaiety
are
you
smart
i
know
they
are
not
but
what
kind
of
how
did
i
come
by
them
that
the
question
did
i
use
a
in
my
mother
house
she
then
told
me
how
lucy
coming
from
school
one
day
had
announced
an
order
from
the
teacher
that
every
girl
in
the
class
must
bring
a
the
next
morning
sadie
nodded
confirmation
of
course
i
went
to
work
and
bought
not
one
brush
but
two
dora
pursued
i
am
as
good
as
lucy
am
i
not
if
she
is
worth
twelve
cents
i
am
and
if
she
is
american
lady
enough
to
use
a
i
am
lucy
is
not
a
usual
name
on
the
east
side
it
was
in
fact
the
principal
of
the
school
who
had
recommended
it
at
solicitation
the
little
girl
had
hitherto
been
called
lizzie
the
commonplace
east
side
version
of
leah
her
hebrew
name
dora
never
liked
it
it
did
not
sound
american
enough
for
there
were
lizzies
or
lizas
in
europe
too
any
greenhorn
might
bear
such
a
name
so
she
called
on
lizzie
principal
and
asked
her
to
suggest
some
nicer
name
for
her
daughter
i
want
a
real
american
one
she
said
the
principal
submitted
half
a
dozen
names
beginning
with
l
and
the
result
was
that
lizzie
became
lucy
dora
went
over
every
spelling
lesson
with
the
child
it
was
so
sweet
to
be
helpful
to
her
in
this
way
lucy
on
her
part
had
to
reciprocate
by
hearing
her
mother
spell
the
same
words
and
often
they
would
have
a
all
of
which
as
i
could
see
had
invested
lucy
with
the
fascination
of
a
spiritual
companion
the
child
had
not
been
at
school
many
weeks
when
she
began
to
show
signs
of
estrangement
from
her
her
yiddish
was
rapidly
becoming
clogged
with
r
and
with
quaintly
twisted
idioms
yiddish
words
came
less
and
less
readily
to
her
tongue
and
the
tendency
to
replace
them
with
their
english
equivalents
grew
in
persistence
dora
would
taunt
her
on
her
gentile
yiddish
yet
she
took
real
pride
in
it
finally
lucy
abandoned
her
native
tongue
altogether
she
still
understood
her
parents
of
course
but
she
now
invariably
addressed
them
or
answered
their
yiddish
questions
in
english
as
a
result
dora
would
make
efforts
to
speak
to
her
in
the
language
that
had
become
the
child
natural
means
of
expression
it
was
a
sorry
attempt
at
first
but
she
was
not
one
to
give
up
without
a
hard
struggle
she
went
at
it
with
great
tenacity
listening
intently
to
lucy
english
and
trying
to
repeat
words
and
phrases
after
her
and
so
with
the
child
assistance
conscious
or
unconscious
she
kept
adding
to
her
practical
acquaintance
with
the
language
until
by
the
end
of
lucy
first
school
year
she
spoke
it
with
considerable
fluency
dora
tried
her
hand
at
writing
but
little
lucy
proved
a
poor
and
she
was
forced
to
confine
herself
to
reading
she
forged
ahead
of
her
reading
pages
which
class
had
not
yet
reached
to
take
lucy
to
school
was
one
of
the
keen
joys
of
existence
very
often
they
would
fall
in
with
lucy
bosom
friend
good
morning
lucy
good
morning
beckie
as
she
described
the
smiling
childishly
way
in
which
the
little
girls
exchanged
their
greetings
and
then
intertwined
their
little
arms
as
they
proceeded
on
their
way
together
sadie
fishy
eyes
filled
with
tears
oh
how
sweet
it
is
to
be
a
mother
dora
said
i
should
say
it
was
her
chum
and
follower
echoed
wiping
her
tears
and
laughing
at
once
there
was
a
curious
element
of
superstition
in
dora
attitude
toward
her
little
girl
she
had
taken
it
into
her
head
that
lucy
had
been
playing
the
part
of
a
mascot
in
her
life
i
was
a
bag
of
bones
until
she
was
born
she
said
why
people
who
are
put
into
the
grave
look
better
than
i
did
but
my
birdie
darling
came
and
well
if
i
do
look
like
a
monkey
now
i
have
her
to
thank
it
was
after
her
birth
that
i
began
to
pick
up
she
had
formed
the
theory
that
the
child
was
born
to
go
to
school
for
her
mother
sake
as
well
as
her
own
a
little
angel
sent
down
from
heaven
to
act
as
a
messenger
of
light
to
her
her
story
made
a
strong
impression
on
me
max
is
not
worthy
of
her
i
reflected
i
wondered
whether
she
was
fully
aware
what
manner
of
man
he
was
chapter
vi
sometimes
we
would
go
to
the
jewish
theater
together
max
dora
and
i
the
children
being
left
at
house
once
when
max
lodge
had
a
benefit
performance
and
he
had
had
some
tickets
for
sale
we
made
up
a
party
of
five
the
two
couples
and
myself
on
that
occasion
i
met
jake
mindels
at
the
playhouse
he
was
now
studying
medicine
at
the
university
medical
college
and
it
was
a
considerable
time
since
i
had
last
seen
him
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
avoided
meeting
him
i
hated
to
stand
confessed
before
him
as
a
traitor
to
my
dreams
of
a
college
education
and
i
begrudged
him
his
medical
books
i
took
max
and
dora
to
see
an
american
play
he
did
not
understand
much
of
what
he
saw
and
was
bored
to
death
as
for
her
she
took
in
scarcely
more
than
did
her
husband
though
she
understood
many
of
the
words
she
heard
but
then
she
reverently
followed
the
good
manners
of
the
real
americans
on
the
stage
and
the
sound
of
their
educated
english
seemed
to
inspire
her
with
mixed
awe
and
envy
once
on
a
monday
evening
when
i
called
on
the
margolises
i
found
max
out
dora
seemed
to
be
ill
at
ease
in
my
company
and
i
did
not
stay
long
it
seemed
natural
to
fear
that
max
who
gave
so
much
attention
to
the
relations
between
the
sexes
should
view
visits
of
this
kind
with
misgivings
his
playful
warnings
that
we
should
beware
of
falling
in
love
with
each
other
seemed
to
be
always
in
the
air
and
on
that
evening
when
he
was
away
and
we
found
ourselves
alone
i
seemed
to
hear
their
echo
more
distinctly
than
ever
it
had
a
disquieting
effect
on
me
that
echo
and
i
decided
never
to
call
unless
max
was
sure
to
be
at
home
i
enjoyed
their
hospitality
too
much
to
hazard
it
rashly
moreover
max
and
dora
lived
in
peace
and
i
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
wish
to
disturb
it
to
my
surprise
however
he
did
not
seem
to
be
jealous
of
me
in
the
least
quite
the
contrary
he
encouraged
my
familiarities
with
her
so
much
so
that
i
soon
drifted
into
the
habit
of
addressing
her
as
dora
the
better
i
knew
her
the
greater
was
the
respect
with
which
she
inspired
me
i
thought
her
an
unusual
woman
and
i
looked
up
to
her
it
became
a
most
natural
thing
that
i
should
propose
myself
as
a
boarder
thousands
of
families
like
the
margolises
kept
boarders
to
lighten
the
burden
of
the
project
had
been
trailing
in
my
mind
for
some
time
and
i
must
confess
the
fact
that
max
stayed
out
till
the
small
hours
four
or
five
nights
a
week
had
something
to
do
with
it
you
would
be
alone
with
her
satan
often
whispered
still
there
was
nothing
definitely
reprehensible
in
this
reflection
it
was
the
prospect
of
often
being
decorously
alone
with
a
woman
who
inspired
me
with
respect
and
interested
me
more
and
more
keenly
that
tempted
me
vaguely
however
i
had
a
feeling
that
i
was
on
the
road
to
falling
in
love
with
her
one
evening
as
i
complained
of
my
restaurant
meals
and
of
certain
inconveniences
of
my
lodgings
max
said
nothing
like
being
married
levinsky
take
my
advice
and
get
you
a
nice
little
wifey
one
like
mine
for
instance
like
yours
the
trouble
is
that
there
is
only
one
such
and
you
have
captured
her
do
worry
dora
broke
in
there
are
plenty
of
others
and
better
ones
too
i
have
a
scheme
i
said
seriously
why
should
you
people
let
me
board
with
you
natural
as
the
suggestion
was
it
took
them
by
surprise
for
a
second
or
two
max
gazed
at
his
wife
with
a
perplexed
air
then
he
said
that
would
not
he
a
bad
idea
would
it
dora
i
do
know
i
am
sure
she
answered
with
a
shrug
and
an
embarrassed
smile
we
have
never
kept
boarders
you
will
try
to
keep
one
now
then
i
urged
if
there
were
room
in
the
house
i
should
be
glad
upon
my
health
and
strength
i
should
oh
you
can
make
room
i
said
of
course
you
can
max
put
in
warming
to
the
plan
somewhat
he
could
have
the
children
bedroom
and
they
could
sleep
in
this
room
she
held
to
her
veto
oh
you
do
know
what
an
obstinate
thing
she
is
max
said
let
her
say
that
white
is
black
and
black
it
must
be
even
if
the
world
turned
upside
down
what
do
you
want
of
me
she
protested
levinsky
may
think
i
really
do
care
to
have
him
let
us
move
to
a
larger
apartment
and
i
be
but
too
glad
to
give
him
a
room
the
upshot
was
a
compromise
for
the
present
i
was
to
content
myself
with
having
my
luncheons
and
dinners
or
suppers
at
their
house
dora
charging
me
cost
price
get
him
to
move
to
one
of
those
new
houses
with
modern
improvements
she
said
to
me
earnestly
to
an
apartment
of
five
light
rooms
and
i
shall
give
you
a
room
at
once
the
rent
would
come
cheaper
than
it
is
now
but
max
would
rather
pay
more
and
have
the
children
grow
in
these
damp
rooms
than
budge
do
bother
me
by
and
by
we
shall
move
out
of
here
all
in
due
time
do
bother
meanwhile
see
that
your
dinners
and
suppers
are
all
right
levinsky
thinks
you
a
good
cook
do
disappoint
him
then
run
away
with
the
idea
it
on
your
own
account
he
wants
to
board
with
us
it
is
on
account
of
your
cooking
that
all
is
it
levinsky
it
a
good
thing
to
know
that
i
am
not
a
bad
cook
at
least
she
returned
but
how
about
the
profits
you
are
going
to
make
on
him
deduct
them
from
your
weekly
allowance
you
know
he
chaffed
her
oh
no
i
am
just
going
to
save
them
and
buy
a
house
on
fifth
avenue
you
ought
to
allow
me
ten
per
cent
for
cash
i
said
she
does
not
want
cash
max
replied
your
note
is
good
enough
i
had
been
taking
my
meals
with
them
a
little
over
a
month
when
they
moved
into
a
new
apartment
with
me
as
their
roomer
and
boarder
the
apartment
was
on
the
third
floor
of
a
corner
house
on
clinton
street
one
of
a
row
of
what
was
then
a
new
type
of
tenement
buildings
it
consisted
of
five
rooms
and
bath
all
perfectly
light
and
it
had
a
tiny
private
corridor
or
vestibule
a
an
enameled
electric
and
gas
light
and
an
electric
there
was
a
rush
for
these
apartments
and
dora
paid
a
deposit
on
the
first
month
rent
before
the
builder
was
quite
through
with
his
work
my
room
opened
into
the
vestibule
its
window
looking
out
upon
a
the
rent
for
the
whole
apartment
was
dollars
my
board
being
five
and
a
half
dollars
a
week
which
was
supposed
to
include
a
monthly
rental
of
six
dollars
for
my
room
the
shorniks
moved
into
the
same
house
chapter
vii
my
growing
interest
in
dora
burst
into
flame
all
at
once
as
it
were
it
happened
at
a
moment
which
is
distinctly
fixed
in
my
mind
at
least
i
distinctly
remember
the
moment
when
i
became
conscious
of
it
it
was
on
an
afternoon
four
days
after
the
margolises
had
taken
possession
of
the
new
place
the
family
was
fully
established
in
it
while
i
had
just
moved
in
i
had
seen
my
room
furniture
and
all
several
times
before
but
i
had
never
seen
it
absolutely
ready
for
my
occupancy
as
i
did
now
it
was
by
far
the
brightest
airiest
and
neatest
room
that
i
had
ever
had
all
to
myself
everything
in
it
from
the
to
the
little
was
invitingly
new
i
can
still
smell
its
grateful
odor
of
freshness
when
i
was
left
to
myself
in
it
for
the
first
time
and
i
shut
its
door
the
room
appealed
to
me
as
a
compartment
in
the
nest
of
a
family
of
which
i
was
a
member
my
lonely
soul
had
a
sense
of
home
and
domestic
comfort
that
all
but
overpowered
me
the
sight
of
the
new
quilt
and
of
the
fresh
white
pillow
coupled
with
the
knowledge
that
it
was
dora
whose
fingers
had
prepared
it
all
for
me
sent
a
glow
of
delight
through
my
heart
dora
name
was
whispering
itself
in
my
mind
i
paused
at
the
window
an
enchanted
man
a
few
minutes
later
when
i
the
where
she
was
counting
some
freshly
ironed
napkins
her
face
seemed
to
have
acquired
a
new
meaning
i
felt
that
a
great
change
had
come
in
my
attitude
toward
her
well
is
everything
all
right
she
inquired
first
rate
i
answered
in
a
voice
that
sounded
unnatural
to
myself
max
was
fussing
with
the
rug
in
the
parlor
the
children
were
gamboling
from
room
to
room
testing
the
faucets
the
get
avey
from
there
dora
shouted
you
hurt
yourself
max
tell
lucy
not
to
touch
the
vill
you
children
children
what
a
madder
vitch
you
he
called
out
from
the
parlor
in
english
with
a
perfunctory
snarl
presently
he
came
into
the
well
are
you
satisfied
with
your
new
palace
he
addressed
me
in
yiddish
and
for
the
hundredth
time
he
proceeded
to
make
jokes
at
the
various
modern
improvements
at
the
abundance
of
light
and
at
my
new
rank
of
real
boarder
it
is
one
of
the
old
and
customs
of
the
ghetto
towns
of
europe
for
a
young
couple
to
live
with
the
parents
of
the
bride
for
a
year
or
two
after
the
wedding
so
max
gaily
dubbed
me
his
boarding
try
to
behave
boarding
he
bantered
me
if
you
your
will
starve
you
the
pleasantry
grated
on
me
dora
ambition
to
learn
to
read
and
spell
english
was
a
passion
and
the
little
girl
played
a
more
important
part
in
the
efforts
she
made
in
this
direction
than
dora
was
willing
to
admit
lucy
would
tell
her
the
meaning
of
new
words
as
she
had
heard
it
at
school
but
it
often
happened
that
the
official
definition
she
quoted
was
incomprehensible
to
both
this
was
apt
to
irritate
dora
or
even
lead
to
a
disagreeable
scene
if
i
happened
to
be
around
i
would
explain
things
to
her
but
she
seemed
to
accept
my
explanations
with
a
grain
of
salt
she
bowed
before
my
intellectual
status
in
a
general
way
but
since
she
had
good
reason
to
doubt
the
quality
of
my
english
enunciation
she
doubted
my
yiddish
interpretations
as
well
indeed
she
doubted
everything
that
did
not
bear
the
indorsement
of
lucy
school
whatever
came
from
that
sacred
source
was
real
yankee
everything
else
was
greenhorn
if
she
failed
to
grasp
some
of
the
things
that
lucy
brought
back
from
school
she
would
blame
it
on
the
child
oh
you
did
understand
what
your
teacher
said
she
would
scold
her
you
must
have
twisted
it
all
up
you
stupid
one
afternoon
when
business
was
slow
and
there
did
not
seem
to
be
anything
to
preclude
my
staying
at
home
and
breathing
the
air
that
dora
breathed
i
witnessed
a
painful
scene
between
them
it
was
soon
after
lucy
returned
from
school
her
mother
wanted
her
to
go
over
her
last
with
her
and
the
child
would
not
do
so
pleading
a
desire
to
call
on
beckie
stay
where
you
are
and
open
your
reader
dora
commanded
lucy
obeyed
whimperingly
read
i
want
to
go
to
beckie
read
i
say
and
she
slapped
her
hand
do
i
remonstrated
let
the
poor
child
go
enjoy
herself
but
it
only
spoiled
matters
read
she
went
on
with
grim
composure
hitting
her
on
the
shoulder
i
do
want
to
i
want
to
go
lucy
sobbed
defiantly
read
and
once
more
she
hit
her
my
heart
went
out
to
the
child
but
i
dared
not
intercede
again
dora
did
not
relent
until
lucy
yielded
sobbingly
i
left
the
room
in
disgust
the
scene
preyed
upon
my
mind
all
that
afternoon
i
remained
in
my
room
until
then
i
found
dora
taciturn
and
downcast
and
i
noticed
that
she
treated
lucy
with
exceptional
though
undemonstrative
tenderness
must
have
given
her
a
licking
max
explained
to
me
with
a
wink
i
kept
my
counsel
she
beat
her
quite
often
sometimes
violently
each
scene
of
this
kind
being
followed
by
hours
of
bitter
remorse
on
her
part
her
devotion
to
her
children
was
above
that
of
the
average
mother
lucy
had
been
going
to
school
for
over
two
years
yet
she
missed
her
every
morning
as
though
she
were
away
to
another
city
and
when
the
little
girl
came
back
dora
face
would
brighten
as
if
a
flood
of
new
sunshine
had
burst
into
the
house
on
one
occasion
there
was
a
quarrel
between
mother
and
daughter
over
the
result
of
a
between
them
which
i
had
umpired
and
which
lucy
had
won
dora
took
her
defeat
so
hard
that
she
was
dejected
all
that
evening
i
have
said
that
despite
her
passionate
devotion
to
lucy
she
was
jealous
of
her
she
was
jealous
not
only
of
the
school
education
she
was
receiving
but
also
of
her
american
birth
she
was
feverishly
ambitious
to
bring
up
her
children
in
the
real
american
syle
and
the
realization
of
her
helplessness
in
this
direction
caused
her
many
a
pang
of
despair
she
was
thirstily
seeking
for
information
on
the
subject
of
table
manners
and
whatever
knowledge
she
possessed
of
it
she
would
practise
and
make
lucy
practise
with
amusing
pomp
and
circumstance
do
reach
out
for
the
herring
lucy
she
would
say
sternly
how
many
times
must
i
tell
you
about
it
what
do
you
say
pass
me
the
herring
mamma
please
not
pass
me
the
herring
mother
please
the
herring
is
passed
with
what
dora
regards
as
a
gesture
thank
you
says
lucy
there
is
another
way
dora
might
add
in
a
case
of
this
kind
instead
of
saying
me
the
herring
or
the
butter
you
can
say
what
is
it
lucy
may
i
trouble
you
for
the
herring
mother
i
asked
her
to
keep
track
of
my
table
etiquette
too
and
she
did
whenever
i
made
a
break
she
would
correct
my
error
solemnly
or
with
a
burst
of
merriment
or
with
a
scandalized
air
as
if
she
had
caught
me
in
the
act
of
committing
a
felony
this
was
her
revenge
for
my
general
intellectual
superiority
which
she
could
not
help
admitting
and
envying
you
just
let
her
teach
you
and
she
will
make
a
man
of
you
max
would
say
to
me
sometimes
when
i
mispronounced
an
english
word
with
which
she
happened
to
be
familiar
or
uttered
an
english
phrase
in
my
talmudic
singsong
she
would
mock
me
gloatingly
on
one
such
occasion
i
felt
the
sting
of
her
triumph
so
keenly
that
i
hastened
to
lower
her
crest
by
pointing
out
that
she
had
said
nice
where
nicely
was
in
order
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
perplexedly
my
reply
was
an
ostentatious
discourse
on
adjectives
and
adverbs
something
which
i
knew
to
be
utterly
beyond
her
depth
it
had
the
intended
effect
she
listened
to
my
explanation
stupidly
and
when
i
had
finished
she
said
with
resignation
i
understand
what
you
say
i
wish
i
had
time
to
go
to
evening
school
at
least
as
you
did
i
have
any
idea
of
these
things
lucy
will
be
educated
for
both
of
us
for
herself
and
for
her
poor
mamma
if
my
mother
had
understood
as
much
as
i
do
it
would
have
been
different
she
uttered
a
sigh
fell
silent
and
then
resumed
but
i
ca
complain
of
my
mother
either
she
was
a
diamond
of
a
woman
and
she
was
wise
as
daylight
but
russia
is
not
america
no
i
ca
complain
of
my
parents
my
father
was
a
poor
man
but
ask
max
or
some
of
our
and
they
will
tell
you
what
a
fine
name
he
had
she
was
talkative
and
somewhat
boastful
like
the
average
woman
of
her
class
but
there
was
about
her
an
elusive
effect
of
reserve
and
earnestness
that
kept
me
at
a
distance
from
her
moreover
the
tireless
assiduity
and
precision
which
she
brought
to
her
housework
and
above
all
the
grim
passion
of
her
intellectual
struggles
created
an
atmosphere
of
physical
and
spiritual
tidiness
about
her
that
inspired
me
with
something
like
reverence
living
in
that
atmosphere
seemed
to
be
making
a
better
man
of
me
attempting
a
lark
with
her
as
i
had
done
with
dienstog
and
levinsky
my
first
two
landladies
in
new
york
was
out
of
the
question
needless
to
explain
that
this
respectful
distance
did
not
prevent
my
eyes
and
ears
from
feasting
upon
her
luxurious
complexion
her
clear
honest
voice
and
all
else
that
made
feel
both
happy
and
forlorn
in
her
company
nor
would
she
aware
as
she
undoubtedly
was
of
the
meaning
of
my
look
or
smile
hesitate
to
respond
to
them
by
some
legitimate
bit
of
coquetry
in
short
we
often
held
converse
in
that
language
of
smiles
glances
blushes
pauses
gestures
which
is
the
gesture
language
of
sex
across
the
barrier
of
decorum
these
speechless
flirtations
cost
me
many
an
hour
which
i
should
have
otherwise
spent
at
my
shop
or
soliciting
trade
when
away
from
the
magnetic
force
of
her
presence
i
would
attend
to
business
with
unabated
intensity
her
image
visited
my
brain
often
but
it
did
not
disturb
me
rather
it
was
the
image
of
some
customer
or
creditor
or
of
some
new
style
of
jacket
or
cloak
that
would
interfere
with
my
peace
of
mind
my
brain
was
full
of
prices
bills
notes
checks
fabrics
color
effects
lines
not
infrequently
while
walking
in
the
street
or
sitting
in
a
i
would
catch
myself
describing
some
of
those
garment
lines
in
the
air
and
yet
through
all
these
preoccupations
i
seemed
to
be
constantly
aware
that
something
unusual
had
happened
to
me
giving
a
novel
tinge
to
my
being
that
i
was
a
changed
man
chapter
viii
max
saw
nothing
his
wife
was
a
very
womanly
woman
with
a
splendid
almost
a
gorgeous
womanly
complexion
and
i
was
a
young
man
in
whom
according
to
his
own
dictum
women
ought
to
be
interested
yet
he
never
seemed
to
feel
anything
like
apprehension
about
us
this
man
who
plumed
himself
upon
his
knowledge
of
women
and
love
and
who
actually
had
a
great
deal
of
insight
in
these
matters
this
man
i
say
was
absolutely
blind
to
his
wife
power
over
me
he
suspected
every
man
and
every
woman
under
the
sun
yet
he
was
the
least
jealous
of
men
so
far
as
his
wife
was
concerned
though
he
loved
and
was
proud
of
her
from
time
to
time
he
would
chaff
dora
and
myself
on
the
danger
of
our
falling
in
love
with
each
other
but
that
was
never
more
than
a
joke
and
at
any
rate
i
heard
it
from
him
far
less
often
than
that
other
joke
of
his
about
my
being
his
and
look
out
he
would
say
to
her
if
you
do
treat
your
right
you
lose
him
i
have
said
that
he
was
proud
of
her
one
evening
while
she
stood
on
a
chair
struggling
with
a
recalcitrant
he
drew
my
attention
to
her
efforts
admiringly
look
at
her
he
said
under
his
breath
another
woman
would
make
her
husband
do
it
not
she
i
ca
kick
she
is
not
a
lazy
slob
is
she
certainly
not
i
asserted
we
watched
her
take
the
shade
down
wind
up
the
spring
fit
the
pins
back
into
their
sockets
and
then
test
the
flap
it
was
in
good
working
order
now
no
she
is
not
a
slob
he
repeated
exultantly
and
she
is
not
a
gossiping
sort
either
she
just
minds
her
own
business
at
this
point
dora
came
over
to
the
table
where
we
sat
move
along
he
said
gaily
do
disturb
us
i
am
telling
levinsky
what
a
bad
girl
you
are
run
along
she
gave
us
a
shy
like
those
that
had
carried
the
first
germ
of
disquiet
into
my
soul
and
moved
away
no
she
is
no
slob
thank
god
he
resumed
he
boasted
of
her
tidiness
and
of
the
way
she
had
picked
up
her
english
and
learned
to
read
and
spell
with
little
lucy
for
her
teacher
he
depicted
the
tenacity
and
unflagging
ardor
with
which
she
had
carried
on
her
mental
pursuits
ever
since
lucy
began
to
go
to
school
once
she
makes
up
her
mind
to
do
something
she
will
stick
to
it
even
if
the
world
went
under
that
the
kind
of
woman
she
is
and
she
is
no
mean
foxy
thing
either
when
she
says
something
you
may
be
sure
she
means
it
if
i
do
say
so
you
ought
to
know
her
by
this
time
have
you
ever
heard
her
say
things
that
are
not
so
or
have
you
heard
her
talk
about
the
neighbors
as
other
will
do
have
you
now
just
tell
me
he
pressed
me
of
course
i
have
not
i
answered
awkwardly
there
are
not
many
women
like
her
i
know
there
are
not
and
well
if
she
is
not
devoted
to
her
hubby
i
do
know
who
is
he
added
sheepishly
chapter
ix
it
was
during
this
period
that
i
received
my
first
baptism
of
dismay
as
patron
of
a
restaurant
the
occasion
was
a
lunch
to
which
i
had
invited
a
buyer
from
philadelphia
the
word
buyer
had
a
bewitching
sound
for
me
inspiring
me
with
awe
and
enthusiasm
at
once
the
word
king
certainly
did
not
mean
so
much
to
me
the
august
person
to
whom
i
was
doing
homage
on
the
occasion
in
question
was
a
man
named
charles
eaton
a
of
new
england
origin
with
a
huge
round
forehead
and
small
blue
extremely
genial
eyes
he
was
a
large
man
and
the
way
his
kindly
little
eyes
looked
from
under
his
hemispherical
forehead
like
two
swallows
viewing
the
world
from
under
the
eaves
of
a
roof
gave
him
a
striking
appearance
the
immense
restaurant
with
its
high
frescoed
ceiling
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
its
rows
and
rows
of
the
crowd
of
customers
the
glint
and
rattle
of
knives
and
forks
the
subdued
tones
of
the
orchestra
and
the
imposing
figures
of
the
waiters
struck
terror
into
my
antomir
heart
the
bill
of
fare
was
of
course
chinese
to
me
though
i
made
a
pretense
of
reading
it
the
words
swam
before
me
my
inside
pocket
contained
sufficient
money
to
foot
the
most
extravagant
bill
our
lordly
waiter
was
likely
to
present
but
i
was
in
constant
dread
lest
my
treasure
disappear
in
some
mysterious
way
so
from
time
to
time
i
felt
my
breast
to
ascertain
whether
it
was
still
there
the
worst
part
of
it
all
was
that
i
had
not
the
least
idea
what
i
was
to
say
or
do
the
occasion
seemed
to
call
for
a
sort
of
table
manners
which
were
beyond
the
resources
not
only
of
a
poor
novice
like
myself
but
also
of
a
trained
specialist
like
dora
finally
my
instinct
of
whispered
in
my
ear
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
so
dropping
the
bill
of
fare
with
an
air
of
mock
despair
i
said
jovially
i
afraid
you
have
to
tell
me
what
to
do
eaton
it
no
use
bluffing
i
have
never
been
in
such
a
fine
restaurant
in
my
life
i
am
scared
to
death
eaton
take
pity
the
philadelphian
who
was
a
though
shrewd
man
was
perplexed
at
first
i
see
he
said
coloring
and
looking
confusedly
at
me
the
next
minute
he
seemed
to
realize
the
situation
and
to
enjoy
it
too
but
even
then
he
was
apparently
embarrassed
i
cracked
another
joke
or
two
at
my
own
expense
until
finally
he
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
and
cheerfully
agreed
to
act
as
master
of
ceremonies
not
only
did
he
do
the
ordering
explaining
things
to
me
when
the
waiter
was
not
around
but
he
also
showed
me
how
to
use
my
napkin
how
to
eat
the
soup
the
fish
the
meat
what
to
do
with
the
and
so
forth
and
so
on
to
the
minutest
detail
i
am
afraid
one
lesson
wo
be
enough
i
said
you
must
give
me
another
chance
with
pleasure
he
replied
only
the
next
will
be
on
me
and
then
he
had
to
tell
me
what
on
me
meant
he
took
a
fancy
to
me
and
that
meant
orders
not
only
from
him
but
also
from
some
people
of
his
acquaintance
buyers
from
other
towns
i
sought
to
dress
like
a
genteel
american
my
favorite
color
for
clothes
and
hats
being
and
still
is
dark
brown
it
became
my
dark
hair
well
i
thought
the
difference
between
taste
and
vulgar
ostentation
was
coming
slowly
but
surely
i
hope
i
remember
the
passionate
efforts
i
made
to
learn
to
tie
a
cravat
then
a
recent
invention
i
was
forever
watching
and
striving
to
imitate
the
dress
and
the
ways
of
the
american
merchants
with
whom
i
was
or
trying
to
be
thrown
all
this
i
felt
was
an
essential
element
in
achieving
business
success
but
the
ambition
to
act
and
look
like
a
gentleman
grew
in
me
quite
apart
from
these
motives
now
dora
seemed
to
notice
these
things
in
me
and
to
like
them
so
i
would
parade
my
newly
acquired
manners
before
her
as
i
did
my
neckties
or
my
english
vocabulary
after
that
lecture
i
gave
her
on
adverbs
she
no
longer
called
my
english
in
question
to
be
educated
and
an
american
lady
had
thanks
to
lucy
influence
become
the
great
passion
of
her
life
it
almost
amounted
to
an
obsession
she
thought
me
educated
and
a
good
deal
of
an
american
so
she
looked
up
to
me
and
would
listen
to
my
harangues
reverently
chapter
x
one
saturday
evening
she
said
to
me
lord
you
are
so
educated
i
wish
i
had
a
head
like
yours
why
you
have
an
excellent
head
dora
i
replied
you
have
no
reason
to
complain
she
sighed
i
wish
i
had
not
gone
into
business
i
resumed
i
had
already
told
her
more
than
once
in
fact
how
i
had
been
about
to
enter
college
when
an
accident
had
led
me
astray
so
i
now
referred
to
those
events
dwelling
regretfully
upon
the
sudden
change
i
had
made
in
my
life
plans
it
was
the
devil
that
put
it
in
my
head
to
become
a
manufacturer
i
said
bitterly
yet
with
relish
in
the
manufacturer
well
one
can
be
a
manufacturer
and
educated
man
at
the
same
time
she
consoled
me
of
course
that
exactly
what
i
always
say
i
returned
joyously
still
i
wish
i
had
stuck
to
my
original
plan
there
was
a
lady
in
antomir
who
advised
me
to
prepare
for
college
she
was
always
speaking
to
me
about
it
it
was
about
max
was
away
to
his
the
children
were
asleep
we
were
alone
in
the
i
expected
her
to
ask
who
that
antomir
lady
was
but
she
did
not
so
i
went
on
speaking
of
matilda
of
my
own
accord
i
sketched
her
as
an
aristocratic
young
woman
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
leading
families
in
town
accomplished
clever
pretty
and
modern
it
was
she
in
fact
who
got
me
the
money
for
my
trip
to
america
i
said
lowering
my
voice
as
one
will
when
a
conversation
assumes
an
intimate
character
was
it
dora
said
also
in
a
low
voice
yes
it
is
a
long
story
it
is
nearly
five
years
since
i
left
home
but
i
still
think
of
it
a
good
deal
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
my
heart
would
snap
unless
i
had
somebody
to
tell
about
it
this
was
my
way
of
drawing
dora
into
a
flirtation
my
first
attempt
in
that
direction
though
in
my
heart
i
had
been
making
love
to
her
for
weeks
i
told
her
the
story
of
my
acquaintance
with
matilda
she
listened
with
interest
with
an
amused
patronizing
glimmer
of
a
smile
you
did
not
fall
in
love
with
her
did
you
she
quizzed
me
as
she
might
lucy
that
the
worst
part
of
it
i
said
gravely
is
it
she
asked
still
gaily
but
with
frank
interest
now
i
recounted
the
episode
at
length
to
put
it
in
plain
english
i
was
using
my
affair
with
matilda
or
shall
i
say
her
affair
with
me
as
a
basis
for
an
adventure
with
dora
at
first
i
took
pains
to
gloss
over
those
details
in
which
i
had
cut
an
undignified
figure
but
i
soon
dropped
all
embellishments
the
episode
stood
out
so
bold
in
my
memory
its
appeal
to
my
imagination
was
so
poignant
that
i
found
an
intoxicating
satisfaction
in
conveying
the
facts
as
faithfully
as
i
knew
how
to
be
telling
a
complete
unvarnished
truth
is
in
itself
a
pleasure
it
is
as
though
there
were
a
special
sense
of
truth
and
sincerity
in
our
just
as
there
is
a
sense
of
musical
harmony
for
example
and
the
gratification
of
it
were
a
source
of
delight
nor
was
this
my
only
motive
for
telling
dora
all
i
had
long
since
realized
that
the
disdain
and
mockery
with
which
matilda
handled
me
had
been
but
a
cloak
for
her
interest
in
my
person
so
when
i
was
relating
to
dora
the
scenes
of
my
ignominy
i
felt
that
the
piquant
circumstances
surrounding
them
were
not
unfavorable
to
me
anyhow
i
was
having
a
singularly
intimate
talk
with
dora
and
she
was
listening
with
the
profoundest
interest
all
the
little
tricks
she
employed
to
disguise
it
notwithstanding
in
depicting
the
scene
of
the
memorable
night
when
matilda
came
to
talk
to
me
at
my
bedside
i
emphasized
the
fact
that
she
had
called
me
a
ninny
i
did
not
know
what
she
meant
i
said
dora
tittered
looking
at
the
floor
shamefacedly
the
nasty
thing
she
said
what
do
you
mean
i
inquired
dishonestly
i
mean
just
what
i
say
she
is
a
nasty
thing
that
grand
lady
of
yours
and
she
added
another
word
the
east
side
name
for
a
woman
of
the
streets
that
gave
me
a
shock
do
call
her
that
i
entreated
please
do
you
are
mistaken
about
her
i
assure
you
she
is
a
highly
respectable
lady
she
has
a
heart
of
gold
i
added
irrelevantly
well
well
you
are
still
in
love
with
her
are
you
i
was
tempted
to
say
no
it
is
you
i
now
love
but
i
merely
said
dolefully
no
not
any
more
she
contemplated
me
amusedly
and
broke
into
a
soft
laugh
the
next
time
we
were
alone
in
the
house
i
came
back
to
it
i
added
some
details
i
found
a
lascivious
interest
in
dwelling
on
our
passionate
kisses
matilda
and
mine
also
it
gave
me
morbid
pleasure
to
have
her
behold
me
at
matilda
feet
lovelorn
disdained
crushed
yet
coveted
kissed
triumphant
dora
listened
intently
she
strove
to
keep
up
an
amused
air
as
though
listening
to
some
childish
nonsense
but
the
look
of
her
eye
tense
or
flinching
and
the
warm
color
that
often
overspread
her
cheeks
betrayed
her
chapter
xi
we
talked
about
my
first
for
weeks
she
asked
me
many
questions
ahout
matilda
mostly
with
that
pretended
air
of
amused
curiosity
every
time
i
had
something
good
to
say
about
matilda
she
would
assail
her
brutally
the
fact
that
dora
never
referred
to
my
story
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
was
a
tacit
confession
that
we
had
a
secret
from
him
outwardly
it
meant
that
the
secret
was
mine
not
hers
that
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
then
there
was
another
secret
the
fact
that
she
was
my
sole
confidante
in
a
matter
of
this
nature
and
this
secret
was
ours
in
common
on
one
occasion
in
the
course
of
one
of
these
confabs
of
ours
she
said
with
malice
do
you
really
think
she
cared
for
you
not
that
much
marking
off
the
tip
of
her
little
finger
why
should
you
say
that
why
should
you
hurt
my
feelings
i
protested
it
still
hurts
your
feelings
then
does
it
there
is
a
faithful
lover
for
you
but
what
would
you
have
me
say
that
she
loved
you
as
much
as
you
loved
her
at
this
dora
jerked
her
head
backward
with
a
laugh
that
rang
so
charmingly
false
and
so
virulent
that
i
was
impelled
both
to
slap
her
face
and
to
kiss
it
but
tell
me
she
said
with
a
sudden
affectation
of
sedate
curiosity
was
she
really
so
beautiful
i
never
said
she
was
beautiful
did
i
you
are
far
more
beautiful
than
she
oh
stop
joking
please
ca
you
answer
seriously
i
really
mean
it
mean
what
that
you
are
prettier
than
matilda
is
that
the
way
you
are
faithful
to
her
oh
that
was
five
years
ago
now
there
is
somebody
else
i
am
faithful
to
she
was
silent
her
cheeks
glowed
why
do
you
ask
who
that
somebody
is
because
i
do
care
what
do
i
care
and
please
do
talk
like
that
i
mean
what
i
say
you
must
promise
me
never
to
talk
like
that
she
said
gravely
during
the
following
few
days
dora
firmly
barred
all
more
or
less
intimate
conversation
she
treated
me
with
her
usual
friendly
familiarity
but
there
was
something
new
in
her
demeanor
something
that
seemed
to
say
i
do
deny
that
i
enjoy
our
talks
but
that
all
the
more
reason
why
you
must
behave
yourself
the
story
of
my
childhood
seemed
legitimate
enough
so
she
let
me
tell
her
bits
of
it
and
before
she
was
aware
of
it
she
was
following
my
childish
with
the
daughter
of
one
of
my
despotic
my
struggles
with
satan
and
my
early
dreams
of
marriage
gradually
she
let
me
draw
her
out
concerning
her
own
past
one
evening
while
lucy
was
playing
with
dannie
for
the
class
dora
told
me
of
an
episode
connected
with
her
betrothal
to
max
was
that
a
love
match
i
asked
with
a
casual
air
when
she
had
finished
she
winced
what
difference
does
it
make
she
said
with
an
annoyed
look
we
were
engaged
as
most
couples
are
engaged
much
i
knew
of
the
love
business
in
those
days
you
speak
as
though
you
married
when
you
were
a
mere
baby
you
certainly
knew
how
you
felt
toward
him
i
do
think
i
felt
anything
she
answered
still
i
insisted
you
said
to
yourself
man
is
going
to
be
my
husband
he
will
kiss
me
embrace
me
how
did
you
feel
then
you
want
to
know
too
much
levinsky
she
said
coloring
you
know
the
saying
you
know
too
much
you
get
old
too
quick
well
i
do
think
i
gave
him
any
thought
at
all
i
was
too
busy
thinking
of
the
wedding
and
of
the
pretty
dress
they
were
making
for
me
besides
i
was
so
rattled
and
so
shy
much
i
understood
i
was
not
quite
nineteen
it
called
to
my
mind
that
in
the
excitement
following
my
death
i
was
so
overwhelmed
by
the
attentions
showered
on
me
that
it
was
a
day
or
two
before
i
realized
the
magnitude
of
my
calamity
anyhow
you
certainly
knew
that
marriage
is
the
most
serious
thing
in
life
i
persisted
oh
i
do
think
i
knew
much
of
anything
and
after
the
wedding
after
the
wedding
i
knew
that
i
was
a
married
woman
and
must
be
contented
she
parried
but
this
is
not
love
i
pressed
her
oh
let
us
not
talk
of
these
things
pray
do
ask
me
questions
like
that
she
said
in
a
low
entreating
voice
it
is
right
i
do
know
if
it
is
right
or
wrong
i
replied
also
in
a
low
voice
all
i
do
know
is
that
i
am
interested
in
everything
that
ever
happened
to
you
silence
fell
she
was
the
first
to
break
it
she
tried
to
talk
of
trivialities
i
scarcely
listened
she
broke
off
again
dora
i
said
amorously
my
heart
is
so
full
do
she
whispered
with
a
gesture
of
pained
supplication
talk
of
something
else
pray
i
ca
i
ca
talk
of
anything
else
nor
think
of
anything
else
either
you
must
you
must
you
must
she
said
with
sudden
vehemence
though
still
with
a
beseeching
ring
in
her
voice
i
wo
let
you
may
i
not
live
to
see
my
children
again
if
i
will
do
you
hear
levinsky
do
you
hear
do
you
hear
i
want
you
to
understand
it
be
a
man
have
a
heart
levinsky
you
must
behave
yourself
if
you
do
you
have
to
move
there
ca
be
any
other
way
about
it
if
you
are
a
real
friend
of
mine
not
an
enemy
you
must
behave
yourself
she
spoke
with
deep
solemn
earnestness
somewhat
in
the
singsong
of
a
woman
reading
the
yiddish
commentary
on
the
five
books
of
moses
or
wailing
over
a
grave
she
went
on
why
should
you
vex
me
you
are
a
respectable
man
you
do
want
to
do
what
is
wrong
you
do
want
to
make
me
miserable
do
you
so
be
good
levinsky
i
beg
of
you
i
beg
of
you
be
good
be
good
be
good
let
us
never
have
another
talk
like
this
do
you
promise
i
was
silent
do
you
promise
levinsky
you
must
you
must
do
you
promise
me
never
to
come
back
to
this
kind
of
talk
i
do
i
said
like
a
guilty
she
was
terribly
in
earnest
she
almost
broke
my
heart
i
could
not
thwart
her
will
she
was
in
love
with
me
days
passed
there
was
no
lack
of
unspoken
tenderness
between
us
that
she
was
tremulously
glad
to
see
me
every
time
i
came
home
was
quite
obvious
but
she
bore
herself
in
such
a
manner
that
i
never
ventured
to
allude
to
my
feeling
much
less
to
touch
her
hand
or
sit
close
to
her
it
is
as
well
that
i
should
not
i
often
said
to
myself
am
i
not
happy
as
it
is
is
it
not
bliss
enough
to
have
a
home
her
home
it
would
be
too
awful
to
forfeit
it
i
registered
a
vow
to
live
up
to
the
promise
she
had
exacted
from
me
but
i
knew
that
i
would
break
it
she
was
in
love
with
me
she
had
an
iron
will
but
i
hoped
that
this
too
would
soon
be
broken
there
were
moments
when
i
would
work
myself
up
to
an
exalted
religious
kind
of
mood
over
it
i
should
be
a
vile
creature
if
i
interfered
with
the
peace
of
this
house
i
would
exhort
myself
passionately
max
has
been
a
warm
friend
to
me
oh
i
will
be
good
dora
talked
less
than
usual
she
too
seemed
to
be
a
changed
person
she
was
particularly
taciturn
when
we
happened
to
be
alone
in
the
house
and
then
it
would
be
difficult
for
us
to
look
each
other
in
the
face
such
occurred
once
or
twice
a
week
quite
late
in
the
evening
i
was
very
busy
at
the
shop
and
i
could
never
leave
it
before
or
even
except
on
sabbath
eve
friday
night
when
it
was
closed
on
those
evenings
when
max
stayed
out
very
late
i
usually
found
her
alone
in
the
little
sewing
mending
or
more
often
poring
over
school
reader
or
after
exchanging
a
few
perfunctory
sentences
with
her
each
of
us
aware
of
the
other
embarrassment
i
would
take
a
seat
a
considerable
distance
from
her
and
take
up
a
newspaper
or
clipping
from
one
while
she
went
on
with
her
work
or
reading
lucy
had
begun
to
take
juvenile
books
out
of
the
circulating
library
of
the
educational
alliance
so
her
mother
would
read
them
also
the
words
were
all
short
and
simple
and
dora
had
not
much
difficulty
in
deciphering
their
meaning
anyhow
she
now
never
sought
my
assistance
for
her
reading
i
can
still
see
her
seated
at
the
table
a
considerable
distance
from
me
moving
her
head
from
word
to
word
and
from
line
to
line
and
silently
working
her
lips
as
though
muttering
an
incantation
i
would
do
her
all
sorts
of
little
services
though
she
never
asked
for
any
all
silently
softly
as
if
performing
a
religious
rite
i
have
said
that
on
such
occasions
i
would
read
my
newspaper
or
some
clipping
from
it
in
truth
i
read
little
else
in
those
days
editorials
of
the
daily
press
interested
me
as
much
as
the
most
sensational
news
and
if
some
of
the
more
important
leading
articles
in
my
paper
had
to
be
left
unread
on
the
day
of
their
publication
i
would
clip
them
and
glance
them
over
at
the
next
leisure
moment
sometimes
days
later
the
financial
column
was
followed
by
me
with
a
sense
of
being
a
member
of
a
caste
for
which
it
was
especially
intended
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest
of
the
world
at
first
the
jargon
of
that
column
made
me
feel
as
though
i
had
never
learned
any
english
at
all
but
i
was
making
headway
in
this
jargon
too
and
when
i
struck
a
recondite
sentence
i
would
cut
the
few
lines
out
and
put
them
in
my
pocket
on
the
chance
of
coming
across
somebody
who
could
interpret
them
for
me
often
too
i
would
clip
and
put
away
a
paragraph
containing
some
curious
piece
of
information
or
a
bit
of
english
that
was
an
addition
to
my
knowledge
of
the
language
my
inside
pocket
was
always
full
of
all
sorts
of
clippings
chapter
xii
it
was
about
this
time
that
i
found
myself
confronted
with
an
unexpected
source
of
anxiety
in
my
business
affairs
there
were
several
circumstances
that
made
it
possible
for
a
financial
midget
like
myself
to
outbid
the
lions
of
the
industry
now
however
a
new
circumstance
arose
which
threatened
to
rob
me
of
my
chief
advantage
and
to
undermine
the
very
foundation
of
my
future
the
rent
of
my
loft
which
was
in
the
slums
was
comparatively
speaking
a
mere
trifle
while
my
overhead
expense
amounted
to
scarcely
anything
at
all
i
did
my
own
bookkeeping
and
a
girl
and
bright
whose
bewigged
mother
was
one
of
my
finishers
took
care
of
the
shop
while
i
was
out
helped
me
with
my
mail
and
sewed
on
buttons
all
for
four
dollars
a
week
another
finisher
a
young
widow
saved
me
the
expense
of
a
figure
woman
to
which
should
be
added
that
i
did
business
on
a
profit
margin
far
beneath
the
consideration
of
the
firms
all
this
however
does
not
include
the
most
important
of
all
the
items
that
gave
me
an
advantage
over
the
princes
of
the
trade
that
was
cheap
labor
three
of
my
men
were
excellent
tailors
they
could
have
easily
procured
employment
in
some
of
the
largest
factories
where
they
would
have
been
paid
at
least
twice
as
much
as
i
paid
them
they
were
bewhiskered
elderly
people
strictly
orthodox
and
extremely
as
to
dress
and
habits
they
felt
perfectly
at
home
in
my
shop
and
would
rather
work
for
me
and
be
underpaid
than
be
employed
in
an
factory
where
a
tailor
was
expected
to
wear
a
starched
collar
and
necktie
and
was
made
the
butt
of
ridicule
if
he
covered
his
head
every
time
he
took
a
drink
of
water
these
however
were
minor
advantages
the
important
thing
the
insurmountable
obstacle
which
kept
these
three
skilled
tailors
away
from
the
big
was
the
fact
that
one
had
to
work
on
saturdays
there
while
in
my
place
one
could
work
on
sunday
instead
of
saturday
my
pressers
were
of
the
same
class
as
my
tailors
as
for
my
operators
who
were
younger
fellows
and
had
adopted
american
ways
my
shop
had
other
attractions
for
them
for
example
my
operations
were
limited
to
a
very
small
number
of
styles
and
as
theirs
was
it
meant
greater
earnings
while
the
employee
of
a
broadway
firm
or
of
one
of
its
contractors
was
engaged
on
a
large
variety
of
garments
being
continually
shifted
from
one
kind
of
work
to
another
a
man
working
for
me
would
be
taken
up
with
the
same
style
for
many
days
in
succession
thus
developing
a
much
higher
rate
of
speed
and
a
fatter
altogether
i
always
contrived
to
procure
the
cheapest
labor
obtainable
although
this
as
we
have
seen
by
no
means
implied
that
my
hands
were
inferior
mechanics
the
sum
and
substance
of
it
all
was
that
i
could
afford
to
sell
a
garment
for
less
than
what
was
its
cost
of
production
in
the
my
business
was
making
headway
when
the
cloak
and
suit
makers
union
sprang
into
life
again
with
the
usual
rush
and
commotion
but
with
unusual
portents
of
strength
and
stability
it
seemed
as
if
this
time
it
had
come
to
stay
my
budding
little
establishment
was
too
small
in
fact
to
be
in
immediate
danger
it
was
one
of
a
scattered
number
of
insignificant
places
which
the
union
found
it
difficult
to
control
still
cheap
labor
being
my
chief
excuse
for
being
the
organization
caused
me
no
end
of
worry
just
when
a
fellow
is
beginning
to
make
a
living
all
sorts
of
black
dreams
will
come
along
and
trip
him
up
i
complained
to
meyer
nodelman
bitterly
a
bunch
of
too
lazy
to
work
will
stir
up
trouble
and
there
you
are
oh
it
wo
last
long
meyer
nodelman
consoled
me
do
be
excited
anyhow
business
does
not
always
go
like
grease
you
know
you
must
be
ready
for
trouble
too
he
told
me
of
his
own
experiences
with
unions
and
he
drifted
into
a
philosophic
view
of
the
matter
you
and
i
want
to
make
as
much
money
as
possible
do
we
he
said
well
the
want
the
same
can
you
blame
them
we
are
fighting
them
and
they
are
fighting
us
the
world
is
not
a
levinsky
it
is
a
big
full
of
chickens
and
they
are
scratching
one
another
and
scrambling
over
one
another
why
because
there
are
little
heaps
of
grain
in
the
yard
and
each
chicken
wants
to
get
as
much
of
it
as
possible
so
let
us
try
our
best
but
why
be
mad
at
the
other
chickens
scratch
away
levinsky
but
what
the
use
being
excited
he
gave
a
chuckle
and
i
could
not
help
smiling
but
at
heart
i
was
bored
and
wretched
the
big
manufacturers
could
afford
to
pay
union
wages
yet
they
were
fighting
tooth
and
nail
and
i
certainly
could
not
afford
to
pay
high
wages
if
i
had
to
i
should
have
to
get
out
of
business
officially
mine
had
become
a
union
shop
yet
my
men
continued
to
work
on
terms
they
made
considerably
more
money
by
working
for
wages
than
they
would
in
the
places
that
were
under
stringent
union
supervision
they
could
work
any
number
of
hours
in
my
shop
and
that
was
what
my
wanted
to
toil
from
sunrise
till
long
after
sunset
was
what
every
tailor
was
accustomed
to
in
antomir
for
instance
only
over
there
one
received
a
paltry
few
shillings
at
the
end
of
the
week
while
i
paid
my
men
many
dollars
so
far
then
i
had
been
successful
in
eluding
the
vigilance
of
the
walking
delegates
and
my
shop
was
in
full
blast
from
in
the
morning
to
midnight
whereas
in
the
genuine
union
shops
the
regular
workday
was
restricted
to
ten
hours
and
overtime
to
three
which
coupled
with
the
especial
advantage
accruing
from
a
limited
number
of
styles
handled
made
my
shop
a
desirable
place
to
my
hands
a
storm
broke
all
formed
a
coalition
and
locked
out
their
union
men
a
bitter
struggle
ensued
as
it
was
rich
in
quaint
material
the
newspapers
bestowed
a
good
deal
of
space
upon
it
i
made
a
pretense
of
joining
in
the
lockout
my
men
clandestinely
continuing
to
work
for
me
more
than
that
my
working
force
was
trebled
for
besides
filling
my
own
orders
i
did
some
of
the
work
of
a
firm
which
found
it
much
more
difficult
to
procure
labor
than
i
did
what
was
a
great
calamity
to
the
trade
in
general
seemed
to
be
a
source
of
overwhelming
prosperity
to
me
but
the
golden
windfall
did
not
last
long
the
agitation
and
the
picketing
activities
of
the
union
aided
by
the
arbeiter
zeitung
a
yiddish
socialist
weekly
were
spreading
a
spell
of
enthusiasm
or
fear
to
which
my
men
gradually
succumbed
my
best
operator
a
young
fellow
who
exercised
much
influence
over
his
shopmates
and
who
had
hitherto
been
genuinely
devoted
to
me
became
an
ardent
convert
to
union
principles
and
led
all
my
operatives
out
of
the
shop
i
organized
a
shop
elsewhere
but
it
was
soon
discovered
somebody
must
have
reported
to
the
editor
of
the
arbeiter
zeitung
that
at
one
time
i
had
been
a
member
of
the
union
myself
for
that
weekly
published
a
scurrilous
paragraph
branding
me
as
a
traitor
i
read
the
paragraph
with
mixed
rage
and
pain
and
yet
the
sight
of
my
name
in
print
flattered
my
vanity
and
when
the
heat
of
my
fury
subsided
i
became
conscious
of
a
sneaking
feeling
of
gratitude
to
the
socialist
editor
for
printing
the
attack
on
me
for
behold
the
same
organ
assailed
the
vanderbilts
the
goulds
the
rothschilds
and
by
calling
me
a
fleecer
of
labor
it
placed
me
in
their
class
i
felt
in
good
company
i
felt
too
that
while
there
were
people
by
whom
fleecers
were
cursed
there
were
many
others
who
held
them
in
high
esteem
and
that
even
those
who
cursed
them
had
a
secret
envy
for
them
hoping
some
day
to
be
fleecers
of
labor
like
them
the
only
thing
in
that
paragraph
that
galled
me
was
the
appellation
of
cockroach
manufacturer
by
which
it
referred
to
me
i
was
going
to
parade
the
quip
before
max
and
dora
but
thought
better
of
it
the
notion
of
dora
hearing
me
called
cockroach
made
me
squirm
but
max
somehow
got
wind
of
the
paragraph
and
one
evening
as
i
came
home
for
supper
he
said
you
got
a
spanking
did
you
i
have
seen
what
they
say
in
the
arbeiter
zeitung
about
you
oh
to
the
eighty
black
years
with
them
i
answered
blushing
and
hastened
to
switch
the
conversation
to
the
lockout
and
strike
in
general
oh
we
get
all
the
men
we
want
i
said
it
only
a
matter
of
time
we
teach
these
scoundrels
a
lesson
they
never
forget
if
only
you
manufacturers
stick
together
you
bet
we
will
we
can
wait
we
are
in
no
hurry
we
can
wait
till
those
tramps
come
begging
for
a
job
i
said
for
the
benefit
of
dora
i
added
a
little
disquisition
on
the
opportunities
america
offered
to
every
man
who
had
brains
and
industry
and
on
the
grudge
which
men
like
myself
were
apt
to
arouse
in
lazy
fellows
those
union
leaders
have
neither
brains
nor
a
desire
to
work
that
why
they
ca
work
themselves
up
i
said
yes
and
why
they
begrudge
those
who
can
all
those
scoundrels
are
able
to
do
is
to
hatch
trouble
i
spoke
as
if
i
had
been
a
capitalist
of
the
higher
altitudes
and
of
long
standing
that
some
of
the
big
cloak
firms
had
promised
to
back
me
with
funds
to
keep
me
from
yielding
to
the
union
i
never
mentioned
chapter
xiii
my
shop
being
practically
closed
i
was
at
home
most
of
the
time
not
only
in
the
evening
but
many
a
forenoon
or
afternoon
as
well
dora
and
i
would
hold
interminable
conversations
our
love
was
never
alluded
to
a
relationship
on
new
terms
seemed
to
have
been
established
between
us
it
was
as
if
she
were
saying
now
is
this
better
why
ca
we
go
on
like
this
forever
sometimes
i
would
watch
her
read
with
lucy
or
else
i
would
take
up
a
newspaper
or
a
book
and
sit
reading
it
at
the
same
table
dora
was
making
rapid
headway
in
her
studies
it
was
july
and
lucy
was
free
from
school
so
she
would
let
her
spend
many
an
hour
in
the
street
but
she
caused
her
to
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
with
her
too
if
she
did
not
read
with
her
she
would
talk
or
listen
to
her
i
often
wondered
whether
it
was
for
fear
of
being
too
much
thrown
into
my
company
that
she
would
make
the
child
stay
indoors
at
all
events
her
readings
spelling
contests
or
talks
with
lucy
bore
perceptible
fruit
her
english
seemed
to
be
improving
every
day
so
much
so
that
we
gradually
came
to
use
a
good
deal
of
that
language
even
when
we
were
alone
in
the
house
even
when
every
word
we
said
had
an
echo
of
intimacy
with
which
the
tongue
we
were
learning
to
speak
seemed
to
be
out
of
accord
one
evening
mother
and
daughter
sat
at
the
open
parlor
window
while
i
was
reclining
in
an
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
lucy
was
narrating
something
and
dora
was
listening
apparently
with
rapt
attention
i
watched
their
profiles
finally
i
said
she
must
be
telling
you
something
important
considering
the
interest
you
are
taking
in
it
everything
she
says
is
important
to
me
dora
answered
what
has
she
been
telling
you
oh
about
her
girls
about
their
brothers
and
their
baseball
games
about
lots
of
things
she
said
with
a
tone
in
her
voice
i
want
to
know
everything
about
her
everything
i
wish
i
could
get
right
into
her
i
wish
i
could
be
a
child
like
her
oh
why
ca
a
person
be
born
over
again
her
longing
ejaculation
had
perhaps
more
to
do
with
her
feelings
for
me
than
with
her
feelings
for
her
child
anyhow
what
she
said
about
her
being
interested
in
everything
that
lucy
had
to
say
was
true
and
whether
she
listened
to
the
child
prattle
or
not
it
always
seemed
to
me
as
though
she
absorbed
every
english
word
lucy
uttered
and
every
american
gesture
she
made
the
american
radiated
a
subtle
influence
a
spiritual
ozone
which
her
mother
breathed
in
greedily
my
own
life
is
lost
but
she
shall
be
educated
these
words
dropped
from
her
lips
quite
often
on
one
occasion
they
came
from
her
with
a
modification
that
lent
them
unusual
meaning
it
was
on
a
friday
evening
max
was
out
as
usual
and
the
children
were
asleep
my
own
life
is
lost
but
lucy
shall
be
happy
she
said
why
i
said
feelingly
why
should
you
think
yourself
lost
i
ca
bear
it
dora
she
made
no
answer
i
attempted
to
renew
the
conversation
but
without
avail
she
answered
in
melancholy
monosyllables
and
my
voice
had
a
constrained
note
at
last
i
burst
out
in
our
native
tongue
why
do
you
torture
me
dora
why
do
you
let
me
talk
and
pour
my
heart
out
you
must
she
said
peremptorily
also
in
yiddish
you
get
me
in
trouble
if
you
do
it
be
the
ruin
of
me
and
of
the
children
too
you
must
but
you
say
your
life
is
lost
i
retorted
coming
up
close
to
the
chair
on
which
she
sat
do
you
think
it
easy
for
me
to
hear
it
do
you
think
my
heart
is
made
of
iron
you
know
everything
without
my
speaking
she
said
slowly
rising
and
drawing
back
you
know
well
enough
that
i
am
not
happy
ca
you
rest
until
you
have
heard
me
say
so
again
and
again
must
you
drink
my
blood
all
right
then
go
ahead
here
i
am
unhappy
i
am
unhappy
i
am
unhappy
max
is
a
good
husband
to
me
i
ca
complain
and
we
get
along
well
too
and
i
shall
be
true
to
him
may
i
choke
right
here
may
darkness
come
upon
me
if
i
ever
cease
to
be
a
faithful
wife
to
him
but
you
know
that
my
heart
has
never
been
happy
lucy
will
be
happy
and
that
will
be
my
happiness
too
she
shall
go
to
college
and
be
an
educated
american
lady
and
if
god
lets
me
live
i
shall
see
to
it
that
she
does
marry
unless
she
meets
the
choice
of
her
heart
she
must
be
happy
she
must
make
up
for
her
mother
lost
life
too
if
my
mother
had
understood
things
as
i
do
i
too
should
have
been
happy
but
she
was
an
woman
and
she
would
have
me
marry
in
the
way
as
she
herself
had
married
without
laying
her
eyes
on
her
one
until
the
morning
after
the
wedding
she
laughed
bitterly
of
course
i
did
see
max
before
the
wedding
but
it
made
no
difference
i
obeyed
my
mother
peace
upon
her
soul
i
thought
were
something
which
none
but
educated
girls
could
dream
of
my
mother
peace
upon
her
soul
told
me
to
throw
all
fancies
out
of
my
mind
that
i
was
a
simple
girl
and
must
get
married
without
fuss
and
i
did
in
this
country
people
have
different
notions
but
i
am
already
married
and
a
mother
all
i
can
do
now
is
to
see
to
it
that
lucy
shall
be
both
educated
and
happy
and
well
i
beg
of
you
i
beg
of
you
i
beg
of
you
levinsky
never
let
me
talk
of
these
things
again
they
must
be
locked
up
in
my
heart
and
the
key
must
be
thrown
into
the
river
levinsky
it
can
not
be
otherwise
levinsky
do
you
hear
chapter
xiv
the
situation
could
not
last
one
morning
about
three
weeks
subsequent
to
the
above
conversation
max
left
town
for
a
day
one
of
his
debtors
a
had
disappeared
without
settling
his
account
and
max
had
recently
discovered
that
he
was
running
a
and
in
new
haven
so
he
went
there
to
see
what
he
could
do
toward
collecting
his
bill
his
absence
for
a
whole
day
was
nothing
new
and
yet
the
house
seemed
to
have
assumed
a
novel
appearance
that
morning
when
after
breakfast
lucy
ran
out
into
the
street
i
felt
as
though
dora
and
i
were
alone
for
the
first
time
and
from
her
constraint
i
could
see
that
she
was
experiencing
a
similar
feeling
i
hung
around
the
house
awkwardly
she
was
trying
to
keep
herself
busy
finally
i
said
i
think
i
be
going
maybe
there
is
some
news
about
the
lockout
i
rose
to
go
to
the
little
corridor
for
my
hat
but
on
my
way
thither
as
i
came
abreast
of
her
i
paused
and
with
amorous
mien
i
drew
her
to
me
she
made
but
a
perfunctory
attempt
at
resistance
and
when
i
kissed
her
she
responded
our
lips
clinging
together
hungrily
it
all
seemed
to
have
happened
in
a
most
natural
way
when
our
lips
parted
at
last
her
cheeks
were
deeply
flushed
and
her
eyes
looked
filmed
dearest
i
whispered
i
must
go
out
she
said
shrinking
back
her
embarrassed
gaze
on
the
floor
i
have
some
marketing
to
do
do
do
go
away
from
me
dora
please
do
i
said
in
yiddish
with
the
least
bit
of
authority
i
love
thee
i
love
thee
dora
i
raved
for
the
first
time
addressing
her
in
the
familiar
pronoun
you
ought
not
to
speak
to
me
like
that
she
said
limply
with
frank
happiness
in
her
voice
it
terrible
what
has
got
into
me
i
strained
her
to
me
once
again
and
again
we
abandoned
ourselves
to
a
transport
of
kisses
and
hugs
dost
thou
love
me
dora
tell
me
i
want
to
hear
it
from
thine
own
lips
she
slowly
drew
me
to
her
bosom
and
clasped
me
with
all
her
might
that
was
her
answer
to
my
question
then
with
a
hurried
parting
kiss
on
my
forehead
she
said
go
attend
to
business
dearest
as
i
walked
through
the
street
i
was
all
but
shouting
to
myself
dora
has
kissed
me
dora
dear
is
mine
my
heart
was
dancing
with
joy
over
my
conquest
of
her
and
at
the
same
time
i
felt
that
i
was
almost
ready
to
lay
down
my
life
for
her
it
was
a
blend
of
animal
selfishness
and
spiritual
sublimity
i
really
loved
her
i
attended
to
my
affairs
that
is
to
some
of
the
affairs
of
the
manufacturers
organization
that
day
but
while
thus
engaged
i
was
ever
tremulously
conscious
of
my
happiness
ever
in
an
uplifted
state
of
mind
i
was
bubbling
over
with
a
desire
to
be
good
to
somebody
to
everybody
except
of
course
the
union
my
membership
in
the
association
flattered
my
vanity
inordinately
and
i
always
danced
attendance
upon
the
other
members
the
german
jews
the
big
men
of
the
trade
now
however
i
ran
their
errands
with
an
alacrity
that
was
not
mere
servility
i
was
constantly
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
was
my
second
as
if
it
were
something
to
be
proud
of
my
love
for
matilda
was
remote
as
a
piece
of
art
while
my
passion
for
dora
was
a
flaming
reality
matilda
only
tortured
me
i
said
to
myself
without
malice
she
treated
me
as
she
would
a
dog
whereas
dora
is
an
angel
i
would
jump
into
fire
for
her
dora
dear
sweetheart
mine
i
had
not
the
patience
to
wait
until
evening
i
ran
in
to
see
her
in
the
middle
of
the
day
she
flung
herself
at
me
and
we
embraced
and
kissed
as
if
we
had
been
separated
for
years
then
holding
me
by
both
hands
she
gave
me
a
long
look
full
of
pensive
bliss
and
clasped
me
to
her
bosom
again
when
she
had
calmed
down
she
smoothed
my
hair
adjusted
my
necktie
told
me
she
did
not
like
it
and
offered
to
get
me
one
more
becoming
do
you
love
me
do
you
really
she
asked
with
deep
earnestness
i
do
i
do
dora
mine
i
am
crazy
for
you
i
replied
now
i
know
what
real
love
means
she
sighed
and
after
a
pause
her
grave
strained
mien
broke
into
a
smile
so
all
you
told
me
about
matilda
was
a
lie
was
it
she
said
roguishly
there
is
no
such
person
in
the
world
is
there
do
talk
about
her
pray
you
do
understand
me
i
never
was
happy
before
never
in
my
life
never
at
all
she
questioned
me
earnestly
never
dora
dearest
anyhow
let
bygones
be
bygones
all
i
know
is
that
i
love
you
that
i
am
going
crazy
for
you
oh
i
do
love
you
and
nobody
else
and
nobody
else
and
you
are
not
lying
lying
why
should
you
talk
like
that
dearest
why
have
you
forgotten
matilda
so
soon
do
you
call
that
soon
it
more
than
five
years
but
you
told
me
that
you
had
been
in
love
with
her
a
considerable
time
after
you
came
to
this
country
will
you
forget
me
so
soon
too
i
squirmed
i
writhed
do
be
tormenting
me
dearest
i
implored
my
voice
quavering
with
impatience
i
love
thee
and
nobody
else
she
fell
into
a
muse
then
she
said
with
a
look
in
her
eyes
i
do
know
where
this
will
land
me
it
seems
as
if
a
great
misfortune
had
befallen
me
but
i
do
care
i
do
care
i
care
come
what
may
i
ca
help
it
at
last
i
know
what
it
means
to
be
happy
i
have
been
dreaming
of
it
all
my
life
now
i
know
what
it
is
like
and
i
am
willing
to
suffer
for
it
yes
i
am
willing
to
suffer
for
you
levinsky
she
spoke
with
profound
earnestness
with
peculiar
solemnity
as
though
chanting
a
prayer
i
was
somewhat
bored
presently
she
paused
and
changing
her
tone
she
asked
matilda
talked
to
you
of
education
she
wanted
you
to
be
an
educated
man
did
she
yes
but
what
did
she
do
for
you
she
drank
your
blood
the
leech
and
when
she
got
tired
of
it
she
dropped
you
a
woman
like
that
ought
to
be
torn
to
pieces
may
every
bit
of
the
suffering
she
caused
you
come
back
to
her
a
thousandfold
may
her
blood
be
shed
as
she
shed
yours
suddenly
she
checked
herself
and
said
but
no
i
am
not
going
to
curse
her
i
do
want
you
to
think
badly
of
her
your
love
must
be
sacred
levinsky
if
you
ever
go
back
on
me
and
love
somebody
else
do
let
her
curse
me
do
let
anybody
say
a
cross
word
about
me
max
came
home
after
midnight
and
i
did
not
see
him
until
the
next
evening
when
we
met
at
supper
dora
was
out
at
that
moment
i
had
to
make
an
effort
to
meet
his
eye
but
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
anything
out
of
the
usual
and
my
awkwardness
soon
wore
off
nor
indeed
was
there
any
change
in
my
feelings
toward
him
i
had
expected
that
he
would
now
be
hateful
to
me
he
was
not
he
was
absolutely
the
same
man
as
he
had
always
been
except
perhaps
that
i
vaguely
felt
like
a
thief
in
his
presence
only
i
hated
to
think
of
dora
while
i
looked
at
him
presently
dora
made
her
appearance
my
embarrassment
returned
more
acute
than
ever
the
consciousness
of
her
confusion
and
above
all
the
consciousness
of
the
three
of
us
being
together
was
insupportable
it
was
a
terrible
repast
though
max
was
absolutely
unaware
of
anything
unnatural
in
our
demeanor
i
retired
to
my
room
soon
after
supper
i
had
a
half
filled
with
books
so
i
drew
a
volume
from
it
i
found
it
difficult
to
get
my
mind
on
it
my
thoughts
were
circling
round
dora
and
max
round
my
precarious
happiness
round
the
novelty
of
carrying
on
a
romantic
conspiracy
with
a
married
woman
dora
was
so
dear
to
me
i
seemed
to
be
vibrating
with
devotion
to
her
regardless
of
the
fact
that
she
was
somebody
else
wife
and
a
mother
of
two
children
my
love
impressed
me
as
something
sacred
i
seemed
to
accept
the
general
rule
that
a
is
a
despicable
creature
a
thief
a
vile
immoral
wretch
but
now
that
i
was
not
facing
max
that
rule
somehow
did
not
apply
to
my
relations
with
dora
simultaneously
with
this
feeling
i
had
another
one
which
excused
my
conduct
on
the
theory
that
everybody
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
likewise
ready
to
set
that
rule
at
defiance
and
to
make
a
mistress
of
his
friend
wife
provided
it
could
be
done
with
absolute
secrecy
and
safety
max
in
my
place
would
certainly
not
have
scrupled
to
act
as
i
did
but
then
i
hated
to
think
of
him
in
this
connection
i
would
brush
all
thoughts
of
him
aside
as
i
would
a
vicious
fly
i
was
too
selfish
to
endure
the
pain
even
of
a
moment
compunction
i
treated
myself
as
a
doting
mother
does
a
wayward
son
the
book
in
my
hands
was
the
first
volume
of
herbert
sociology
my
interest
in
this
author
and
in
darwin
was
of
recent
origin
it
had
been
born
of
my
hatred
for
the
union
in
fact
this
is
how
i
came
to
discover
the
existence
of
the
two
great
names
and
to
develop
a
passion
for
the
ideas
with
which
they
are
identified
in
my
virulent
criticism
of
the
leaders
of
the
union
i
had
often
characterized
them
as
so
many
jealous
of
those
who
had
succeeded
in
business
by
their
superior
brains
industry
and
efficiency
one
day
i
found
a
long
editorial
in
my
newspaper
an
answer
to
a
letter
from
a
socialist
the
editorial
derived
its
inspiration
from
the
theory
of
the
struggle
for
existence
and
the
survival
of
the
fittest
unlike
many
of
the
other
editorials
i
had
read
it
breathed
conviction
it
was
obviously
a
work
of
love
when
the
central
idea
of
the
argument
came
home
to
me
i
was
in
a
turmoil
of
surprise
and
elation
why
that
just
what
i
have
been
saying
all
these
days
i
exclaimed
in
my
heart
the
able
fellows
succeed
and
the
misfits
fail
then
the
misfits
begrudge
those
who
accomplish
things
i
almost
felt
as
though
darwin
and
spencer
had
plagiarized
a
discovery
of
mine
then
as
i
visualized
the
struggle
for
existence
i
recalled
meyer
nodelman
parable
of
chickens
fighting
for
food
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
between
the
two
of
us
nodelman
and
i
had
hit
upon
the
whole
darwinian
doctrine
later
however
when
i
dipped
into
social
statics
i
was
by
the
wondrous
novelty
of
the
thing
and
by
a
sense
of
my
own
futility
ignorance
and
cheapness
i
felt
at
the
gates
of
a
great
world
of
knowledge
whose
existence
i
had
not
even
suspected
i
had
to
read
the
origin
of
species
and
the
descent
of
man
and
then
spencer
again
i
sat
up
nights
reading
these
books
apart
from
the
purely
intellectual
intoxication
they
gave
me
they
flattered
my
vanity
as
one
of
the
fittest
it
was
as
though
all
the
wonders
of
learning
acumen
ingenuity
and
assiduity
displayed
in
these
works
had
been
intended
among
other
purposes
to
establish
my
title
as
one
of
the
victors
of
existence
a
and
every
one
else
who
was
poor
was
an
object
of
contempt
to
me
a
misfit
a
weakling
a
failure
one
of
the
ruck
chapter
xv
it
was
august
in
normal
times
this
would
have
been
the
beginning
of
the
great
winter
season
in
our
trade
as
it
was
the
deadlock
continued
the
stubbornness
of
the
men
far
from
showing
signs
of
wilting
under
the
strain
of
so
many
weeks
of
enforced
idleness
and
suffering
seemed
to
be
gathering
strength
while
our
own
people
the
manufacturers
were
frankly
weakening
the
danger
of
having
the
great
season
pass
without
one
being
able
to
fill
a
single
order
overcame
the
fighting
blood
of
the
most
pugnacious
among
them
one
was
confronted
with
the
risk
of
losing
one
best
customers
the
trade
threatened
to
pass
from
new
york
to
philadelphia
and
chicago
if
you
called
the
attention
of
a
manufacturer
to
the
unyielding
courage
of
the
workmen
the
reply
invariably
was
first
that
it
was
all
mere
bravado
and
second
that
anyhow
the
poor
devils
had
nothing
to
lose
while
the
manufacturers
had
their
investments
to
lose
the
press
supported
the
strikers
it
did
so
not
because
they
were
but
because
they
were
their
district
was
the
great
field
of
activity
for
the
american
university
settlement
worker
and
fashionable
slummer
the
east
side
was
a
place
upon
which
one
descended
in
quest
of
esoteric
types
and
local
color
as
well
as
for
purposes
of
philanthropy
and
uplift
work
to
spend
an
evening
in
some
east
side
café
was
regarded
as
something
like
spending
a
few
hours
at
the
louvre
so
much
so
that
one
such
café
in
the
depth
of
east
houston
street
was
making
a
fortune
by
purveying
expensive
wine
dinners
to
people
from
who
came
there
ostensibly
to
see
how
the
other
half
lived
but
who
only
saw
one
another
eat
and
drink
in
freedom
from
the
restraint
of
manners
accordingly
to
show
sympathy
for
east
side
strikers
was
within
the
bounds
of
the
highest
propriety
it
was
as
correct
as
belonging
to
the
episcopal
church
and
so
public
opinion
was
wholly
on
the
side
of
the
union
this
hastened
the
end
we
succumbed
a
settlement
was
patched
up
we
were
beaten
but
even
this
did
not
appease
the
men
they
repudiated
the
agreement
between
their
organization
and
ours
branding
it
as
a
trap
and
the
strike
was
continued
then
the
manufacturers
yielded
completely
acceding
to
every
demand
of
the
union
i
became
busy
i
continued
to
curse
the
union
but
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
wished
it
well
for
the
vigor
with
which
it
enforced
its
increased
wage
scale
in
all
larger
factories
gave
me
greater
advantages
than
ever
i
was
still
able
to
get
men
who
were
willing
to
trick
the
organization
every
friday
afternoon
these
men
received
which
bore
figures
in
strict
conformity
with
the
union
schedule
but
the
contents
of
which
were
considerably
below
the
sum
marked
outside
subsequently
this
proved
to
be
a
risky
practice
to
pursue
for
the
walking
delegates
were
wide
awake
and
apt
to
examine
the
envelopes
as
the
operatives
were
emerging
from
the
shop
accordingly
i
adopted
another
system
the
men
would
receive
the
union
pay
in
full
but
on
the
following
monday
each
of
them
would
pay
me
back
the
difference
between
the
official
and
the
actual
wage
the
usual
practice
was
for
the
employee
to
put
the
few
dollars
into
his
little
which
he
would
then
place
on
my
desk
for
the
ostensible
purpose
of
having
his
account
verified
by
thus
cheating
the
union
i
could
now
undersell
the
bigger
manufacturers
more
easily
than
i
had
been
able
to
do
previous
to
the
lockout
and
strike
i
had
more
orders
than
i
could
fill
money
was
coming
in
in
floods
the
lockout
and
the
absolute
triumph
of
the
union
was
practically
the
making
of
me
i
saw
much
less
of
dora
than
i
had
done
during
the
five
months
of
the
lockout
and
our
happiness
when
we
managed
to
be
left
alone
was
all
the
keener
for
it
our
best
time
for
a
were
the
hours
between
and
on
the
evenings
when
max
was
sure
to
be
away
at
his
but
then
it
often
happened
that
those
were
among
my
busiest
hours
at
the
shop
sometimes
i
would
snatch
half
an
hour
from
my
work
in
the
middle
of
a
busy
day
to
surprise
her
with
my
caresses
if
a
week
passed
without
my
doing
so
she
would
punish
me
with
mute
scenes
of
jealousy
of
which
none
but
she
and
i
were
aware
she
would
avoid
looking
at
me
and
i
would
press
my
hand
to
my
heart
and
raise
a
pleading
gaze
at
her
which
said
i
could
get
away
dearest
honest
i
could
one
evening
i
bought
her
some
roses
as
i
carried
them
home
i
was
thrilled
as
much
by
the
fact
that
i
david
of
abner
court
was
taking
flowers
to
a
lady
as
i
was
by
visioning
the
moment
when
i
should
hand
them
to
dora
when
i
came
home
and
put
my
offering
into
her
hand
she
was
in
a
flurry
of
delight
over
it
but
she
was
scared
to
death
lest
it
should
betray
our
secret
after
giving
way
to
bursts
of
admiration
for
the
flowers
and
myself
and
smelling
her
fill
and
covering
me
with
kisses
she
burned
the
bouquet
in
the
stove
and
forbade
me
to
use
this
method
of
showing
her
attention
again
your
dear
eyes
are
the
best
flowers
you
can
bring
me
she
said
her
love
burned
with
a
steady
flame
bright
and
even
it
manifested
itself
in
a
thousand
little
things
which
she
did
for
the
double
purpose
of
ministering
to
my
comfort
and
keeping
me
in
mind
of
herself
i
felt
it
in
the
taste
of
the
coffee
i
drank
in
the
quality
of
my
cup
and
saucer
in
the
painstaking
darning
on
my
socks
in
the
frequency
with
which
my
room
was
swept
my
towel
changed
my
books
dusted
did
you
notice
the
new
on
your
she
asked
me
one
morning
do
you
deserve
it
do
you
know
how
often
i
am
in
your
room
every
day
just
guess
a
million
times
a
day
to
you
it
a
joke
but
if
you
loved
as
i
do
you
would
not
be
up
to
joking
very
well
i
cry
and
i
personated
a
boy
crying
do
it
breaks
my
heart
she
said
earnestly
i
ca
see
you
crying
even
for
fun
she
kissed
my
eyes
no
really
i
go
to
your
room
twenty
times
a
day
perhaps
when
i
am
there
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
nearer
to
you
i
kiss
the
pillow
on
which
you
sleep
i
pat
the
blanket
the
pitcher
every
book
of
yours
everything
your
dear
little
hands
touch
i
want
you
to
know
it
i
want
you
to
know
how
i
love
you
i
knew
that
love
was
sweet
but
i
never
knew
that
it
was
so
sweet
oh
my
loved
one
she
would
pour
out
all
sorts
of
endearments
on
me
some
of
them
rather
of
a
fantastic
nature
but
my
loved
one
became
her
favorite
appellation
while
i
found
special
relish
in
calling
her
my
bride
or
bridie
mine
i
can
almost
feel
her
white
fingers
as
they
played
with
my
abundant
dark
hair
or
rested
on
my
shoulders
while
she
looked
into
my
eyes
and
murmured
yearningly
my
loved
one
my
loved
one
my
loved
one
the
set
of
my
shoulders
was
a
special
object
of
her
admiration
she
would
shake
them
tenderly
call
me
monkey
and
ask
me
if
i
realized
how
much
she
loved
me
and
if
i
deserved
it
all
bad
boy
that
i
was
she
held
me
in
check
with
an
iron
hand
whenever
my
caresses
threatened
to
overstep
the
bounds
of
what
she
termed
respectable
love
she
would
stop
them
with
clouded
eyes
she
would
slap
my
hand
and
then
kiss
it
saying
be
a
gentleman
levinsky
be
a
gentleman
ca
you
be
a
gentleman
oh
you
do
love
me
i
would
grunt
i
do
i
do
i
wish
you
would
love
me
half
as
much
with
a
sigh
if
you
did
you
would
not
behave
the
way
you
do
that
all
your
love
amounts
to
behaving
like
that
all
men
are
hogs
after
all
with
which
she
would
take
to
lecturing
me
and
pouring
out
her
infatuated
heart
in
that
solemn
singsong
of
hers
which
somewhat
bored
me
if
she
thought
my
kisses
unduly
passionate
and
the
amorous
look
of
my
eye
dangerous
she
would
move
away
from
me
do
be
angry
at
me
sweetheart
she
would
say
cooingly
i
am
not
angry
but
you
do
love
me
why
should
you
hurt
my
feelings
like
that
why
should
you
shed
my
blood
am
i
not
yours
heart
and
soul
am
i
not
ready
to
cut
myself
to
pieces
to
please
you
why
should
you
torture
me
what
are
you
afraid
of
he
wo
know
any
more
than
he
does
now
i
once
urged
she
blushed
looking
at
the
floor
after
a
minute
silence
she
said
dolefully
it
is
so
much
on
account
of
that
as
on
account
of
the
children
how
could
i
look
lucy
in
the
face
her
eyes
grew
humid
my
heart
went
out
to
her
i
understand
you
are
right
i
yielded
the
scene
repeated
itself
not
many
days
after
it
occurred
again
and
again
at
almost
regular
intervals
she
fought
bravely
many
months
passed
and
still
she
was
able
to
look
lucy
in
the
face
at
first
for
a
period
of
six
or
seven
weeks
my
moral
conduct
outside
the
house
was
immaculate
then
i
renewed
my
excursions
to
certain
streets
i
made
rather
frequent
calls
at
the
apartment
of
a
handsome
hungarian
woman
who
called
herself
cleo
once
in
a
frenzy
i
tried
to
imagine
that
she
was
dora
and
then
i
experienced
qualms
of
abject
compunction
and
sometimes
lucy
would
arouse
my
jealous
rancor
as
a
living
barrier
between
her
mother
and
myself
but
she
was
really
dear
to
me
i
revered
dora
for
her
fortitude
and
lucy
appealed
to
me
as
the
embodiment
of
her
mother
saintliness
i
would
watch
lucy
she
was
an
interesting
study
her
manner
of
speaking
her
giggle
her
childish
little
affectations
seemed
to
grow
more
american
every
day
she
was
like
a
little
foreigner
in
the
house
dora
was
watching
and
studying
her
with
a
feeling
akin
to
despair
i
thought
it
was
as
though
she
was
pursuing
the
little
girl
with
outstretched
arms
vainly
trying
to
overtake
her
chapter
xvi
i
was
rapidly
advancing
on
the
road
to
financial
triumphs
i
was
planning
to
move
my
business
to
larger
quarters
in
the
same
modest
neighborhood
chaikin
my
partner
wife
failed
to
realize
the
situation
however
she
could
not
forgive
me
the
false
representations
i
had
made
to
her
regarding
my
assets
and
where
is
the
treasure
you
were
expecting
she
would
twit
me
you
never
tell
a
lie
do
you
you
simply
do
know
how
to
do
it
poor
thing
when
we
were
in
the
midst
of
an
avalanche
of
lucrative
orders
promising
a
brilliant
winter
season
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
withdraw
her
husband
from
the
firm
in
which
he
was
a
silent
partner
her
decision
was
apparently
based
on
the
extreme
efforts
she
had
once
seen
me
making
to
raise
five
hundred
dollars
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
was
due
to
the
rapidity
of
our
growth
i
lacked
capital
but
then
my
credit
was
growing
too
and
altogether
things
were
in
a
most
encouraging
condition
what
is
the
use
worrying
along
like
that
she
said
you
deceived
me
from
the
start
you
made
me
believe
you
had
a
lot
of
money
while
you
were
really
a
beggar
yes
you
are
a
beggar
and
a
beggar
you
are
bound
to
stay
a
beggar
and
a
swindler
what
you
are
you
have
fooled
me
long
enough
you
ca
fool
me
any
longer
so
there
her
husband
was
still
employed
by
the
german
firm
attending
to
the
needs
of
our
growing
little
factory
surreptitiously
every
evening
and
on
sundays
the
day
seemed
near
when
it
would
pay
him
to
give
all
his
time
to
our
shop
and
he
was
aware
of
it
too
to
some
extent
at
least
but
chaikin
ordained
otherwise
i
attempted
to
present
the
actual
state
of
affairs
to
her
but
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
it
suddenly
flashed
upon
my
mind
that
it
might
all
be
to
my
advantage
a
designer
can
be
hired
i
said
to
myself
the
business
is
progressing
rapidly
to
make
him
my
life
partner
is
too
high
a
price
to
pay
for
his
skill
besides
having
him
for
a
partner
actually
means
having
his
nuisance
of
a
wife
for
a
partner
it
will
be
a
good
thing
to
get
rid
of
her
i
consulted
max
as
i
did
quite
often
now
not
that
i
thought
myself
in
need
of
his
advice
or
anybody
else
for
that
matter
success
had
made
me
too
for
that
i
played
the
intimate
and
ardent
friend
and
this
was
simply
part
of
my
personation
to
flatter
his
vanity
i
would
make
him
think
his
suggestions
had
been
acted
upon
and
that
they
had
brought
good
results
as
a
consequence
he
was
developing
the
notion
that
my
success
was
largely
due
to
his
guidance
a
notion
which
jarred
on
me
but
which
i
humored
nevertheless
do
you
know
what
the
matter
he
said
sagely
chaikin
must
have
found
another
partner
for
her
husband
some
fellow
with
big
money
i
suppose
you
are
right
max
i
said
sincerely
how
stupid
i
am
why
of
course
they
have
got
another
partner
of
course
they
have
he
repeated
with
elation
so
much
the
better
for
you
let
them
go
to
the
eighty
black
years
do
run
after
him
just
do
as
i
tell
you
and
you
be
all
right
levinsky
my
advice
has
never
got
you
in
trouble
has
it
indeed
not
indeed
not
i
answered
max
blindness
to
what
was
going
on
between
dora
and
myself
was
a
riddle
to
which
i
vainly
sought
a
solution
that
this
cynic
who
charged
every
man
and
woman
with
immorality
should
in
the
circumstances
be
so
absolutely
undisturbed
in
his
confidence
regarding
his
wife
seemed
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
when
i
now
think
of
the
riddle
i
see
its
solution
in
a
modified
version
of
the
old
rule
concerning
the
mote
in
thy
neighbor
eye
and
the
beam
in
thine
own
eve
your
worst
pessimist
is
after
all
an
optimist
with
regard
to
himself
we
are
quick
to
recognize
the
gravity
of
ill
health
in
somebody
else
yet
we
ourselves
may
be
on
the
very
brink
of
death
without
realizing
it
it
is
a
special
phase
of
selfishness
we
are
loath
to
connect
the
idea
of
a
catastrophe
with
our
own
person
max
who
saw
a
mote
in
the
eye
of
everybody
else
wife
failed
to
perceive
the
beam
in
the
eye
of
his
own
as
for
sadie
who
lived
in
the
same
house
now
and
who
visited
dora
apartment
at
all
hours
she
was
too
silly
and
too
deeply
infatuated
with
her
friend
to
suspect
her
of
anything
wrong
i
idolized
dora
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
adored
her
soul
even
more
than
i
did
her
body
i
was
under
her
moral
influence
and
the
firmness
with
which
she
maintained
the
distance
between
us
added
to
my
respect
for
her
and
yet
i
never
ceased
to
dream
of
and
to
seek
her
moral
downfall
i
had
extended
my
canvassing
activities
to
a
number
of
cities
outside
new
york
my
territory
being
a
semicircle
with
a
radius
of
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
i
had
long
since
picked
up
some
of
the
business
jargon
of
the
country
and
i
was
thirstily
drinking
in
more
and
more
what
do
you
think
of
this
number
mr
i
would
say
to
a
merchant
as
i
dangled
a
garment
in
front
of
him
you
can
make
a
run
on
it
it
the
kind
of
suit
that
gives
the
wearer
an
air
of
distinction
if
i
heard
a
bit
of
business
rhetoric
that
i
thought
effective
i
would
jot
it
down
and
commit
it
to
memory
in
like
manner
i
would
write
down
every
new
piece
of
slang
the
use
of
the
latest
popular
phrase
being
as
i
thought
helpful
in
making
oneself
popular
with
americans
especially
with
those
of
the
young
generation
but
somehow
a
slang
phrase
would
be
in
general
use
for
a
considerable
time
before
it
attracted
my
attention
the
americans
i
met
were
so
quick
to
discern
and
adopt
these
phrases
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
born
with
a
special
slang
sense
which
i
poor
foreigner
that
i
was
lacked
that
i
was
not
born
in
america
was
something
like
a
physical
defect
that
asserted
itself
in
many
disagreeable
ways
a
physical
defect
which
alas
no
surgeon
in
the
world
was
capable
of
removing
other
things
that
i
would
enter
in
my
were
names
of
dishes
on
the
bills
of
fare
of
the
better
restaurants
with
explanations
of
my
own
i
would
describe
the
difference
between
roquefort
cheese
and
liederkranz
cheese
between
consommé
celestine
and
consommé
princesse
i
would
make
a
note
of
the
composition
of
macaroni
au
gratin
the
appearance
and
taste
of
potatoes
lyonnaise
of
various
but
i
gradually
picked
up
this
information
in
a
practical
way
and
really
had
no
need
of
my
culinary
notes
i
had
many
occasions
to
eat
in
restaurants
and
i
was
getting
to
feel
quite
at
home
in
them
max
conjecture
regarding
chaikin
was
borne
out
the
talented
designer
had
given
up
his
job
at
the
manheimer
brothers
and
opened
a
house
with
a
man
who
had
made
considerable
money
as
a
cloak
salesman
and
as
a
landlord
for
a
partner
when
max
heard
of
it
he
was
overjoyed
i
tell
you
what
levinsky
he
said
half
in
jest
and
half
in
earnest
let
the
two
of
us
make
a
partnership
of
it
i
could
put
some
money
into
the
business
i
reflected
that
when
i
approached
him
for
a
loan
of
four
hundred
dollars
on
my
first
visit
at
his
house
he
had
pleaded
poverty
i
could
do
a
good
deal
of
hustling
too
he
added
gravely
between
the
two
of
us
we
should
make
a
great
success
of
it
i
gave
him
an
evasive
answer
i
must
have
looked
annoyed
for
he
exclaimed
look
at
him
look
at
him
dora
scared
to
death
he
and
to
me
do
be
uneasy
old
chap
i
am
not
going
to
snatch
your
factory
from
you
but
you
are
a
big
hog
all
the
same
i
can
tell
you
that
how
will
you
manage
all
alone
who
will
take
care
of
your
business
when
you
go
traveling
oh
i
manage
it
somehow
i
answered
making
an
effort
to
be
pleasant
chaikin
was
scarcely
ever
in
the
shop
anyhow
chapter
xvii
i
traveled
quite
often
sometimes
staying
away
from
new
york
for
two
or
three
days
but
more
frequently
for
only
one
day
on
one
occasion
however
i
was
detained
on
the
road
for
five
days
in
succession
it
was
the
beginning
of
june
a
little
over
a
year
since
the
margolises
moved
into
the
clinton
street
flat
with
myself
as
their
boarder
i
was
homesick
i
missed
dora
acutely
i
loved
her
passionately
tenderly
devotedly
i
now
felt
it
with
special
force
her
face
and
figure
loomed
up
a
hundred
times
a
day
dora
dear
bridie
mine
i
would
whisper
all
but
going
to
pieces
with
tenderness
and
yearning
one
afternoon
after
closing
an
unexpectedly
large
sale
in
a
department
store
i
went
to
the
jewelry
department
of
the
same
firm
and
paid
a
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
for
a
bracelet
i
knew
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
wear
it
yet
i
was
determined
to
make
her
accept
it
let
her
keep
it
in
some
i
thought
let
her
steal
an
occasional
look
at
it
i
do
care
what
she
does
with
it
i
want
her
to
know
that
i
think
of
her
that
i
am
crazy
for
her
it
was
friday
evening
when
i
returned
to
new
york
having
been
on
the
road
since
the
preceding
monday
morning
i
first
went
to
my
place
of
business
and
then
to
a
restaurant
for
supper
i
would
not
make
my
appearance
at
the
house
until
half
past
when
the
coast
was
sure
to
be
clear
with
thrills
of
anticipation
that
verged
on
physical
pain
i
was
looking
forward
to
the
moment
when
i
should
close
the
bracelet
about
her
slender
white
wrist
at
the
fixed
minute
i
was
at
the
door
of
the
clinton
street
apartment
i
pulled
the
bell
i
expected
an
excited
rush
a
violent
opening
of
the
door
a
tremulous
my
loved
one
my
loved
one
there
was
a
peculiar
disappointment
in
store
for
me
she
received
me
icily
not
letting
me
come
near
her
why
what
the
matter
what
up
nothing
she
muttered
when
we
reached
the
light
of
the
sabbath
candles
in
the
i
noticed
that
she
looked
worn
and
haggard
what
has
happened
i
asked
greatly
perplexed
i
have
something
for
you
i
said
producing
the
box
containing
the
bracelet
and
opening
it
here
my
bride
how
dare
you
call
me
you
hypocrite
she
gasped
away
with
you
your
present
and
all
why
why
what
does
it
all
mean
i
asked
between
mirth
and
perplexity
for
an
answer
she
merely
continued
you
thought
you
could
bribe
me
by
this
present
of
yours
did
you
you
can
fool
me
no
longer
i
have
found
you
out
you
have
fallen
into
your
own
trap
you
have
how
dare
you
buy
me
presents
at
this
she
tore
the
bracelet
out
of
my
hand
and
flung
it
into
the
little
corridor
she
was
on
the
verge
of
a
fit
of
hysterics
i
fetched
her
a
glass
of
water
but
she
dashed
it
out
of
my
hand
then
frightened
and
sobered
by
the
crash
she
first
tiptoed
to
the
bedroom
to
ascertain
if
lucy
was
not
awake
and
listening
and
then
went
to
the
little
corridor
picked
up
the
bracelet
and
slipped
it
into
my
pocket
if
you
have
decided
to
get
married
i
ca
stop
you
of
course
she
began
in
a
ghastly
undertone
as
she
crouched
to
gather
up
the
fragments
of
the
glass
and
to
wipe
the
floor
decided
to
get
married
i
interrupted
her
where
on
earth
did
you
get
that
what
are
you
talking
about
dora
she
made
no
answer
i
continued
to
protest
my
innocence
finally
when
she
had
removed
the
broken
glass
she
said
it
no
use
pretending
you
do
know
anything
about
it
it
wo
do
you
any
good
you
have
been
very
foxy
about
it
but
you
made
a
break
and
there
you
are
you
think
you
are
very
clever
if
you
were
you
would
let
your
shadchen
note
know
where
you
live
oh
i
see
i
said
with
a
hearty
laugh
has
he
been
here
and
i
gave
way
to
another
guffaw
shadchen
was
a
conspiracy
name
for
a
man
who
would
bring
an
employer
together
with
who
were
willing
to
cheat
the
union
the
one
who
performed
these
services
for
me
was
one
of
my
own
hands
he
was
thoroughly
dishonest
but
he
possessed
a
gentle
disposition
and
a
certain
gift
of
expression
this
gave
him
power
over
his
shopmates
he
was
their
shop
chairman
and
a
member
of
their
price
committee
he
was
the
only
man
in
my
employ
who
actually
received
the
full
union
price
in
addition
to
this
i
paid
him
his
broker
commission
for
every
new
man
he
furnished
me
and
various
sums
as
bribes
pure
and
simple
i
explained
it
all
to
dora
the
ardor
with
which
i
spoke
and
the
details
of
my
dealings
with
the
shadchen
must
have
made
my
explanation
convincing
for
she
accepted
it
at
once
you
not
fooling
me
are
you
she
asked
piteously
yet
in
a
tone
of
immense
relief
strike
me
dumb
if
do
curse
yourself
she
said
clapping
her
hand
over
my
mouth
i
ca
bear
to
hear
it
i
believe
you
if
you
knew
what
i
have
gone
through
poor
poor
child
i
said
kissing
her
soft
white
fingers
tenderly
poor
poor
baby
how
could
you
think
of
such
a
thing
there
is
only
one
bride
for
me
in
all
the
world
and
that
is
my
own
dora
darling
her
face
shone
with
a
wan
beseeching
kind
of
light
again
i
drew
forth
the
bracelet
foolish
child
i
said
examining
it
thank
god
it
is
damaged
not
a
bit
i
took
her
by
the
hand
opened
the
bracelet
and
closed
it
over
her
wrist
she
instantly
took
it
off
again
with
an
instinctive
at
the
door
then
holding
it
up
to
the
light
admiringly
she
said
oh
oh
must
have
cost
a
pile
of
money
why
did
you
spend
so
much
i
ca
wear
it
anyway
better
return
it
never
it
yours
my
sweetheart
do
whatever
you
like
with
it
put
it
away
somewhere
if
you
wear
it
for
one
minute
every
week
i
shall
be
happy
if
you
only
look
at
it
once
in
a
while
i
shall
be
happy
i
am
afraid
to
keep
it
somebody
may
come
across
it
some
day
better
return
it
my
loved
one
i
am
happy
as
it
is
it
would
make
me
nervous
to
have
it
in
the
house
she
made
me
take
it
back
thank
god
it
was
a
real
shadchen
i
thought
i
was
going
to
commit
suicide
she
said
i
seized
her
in
my
arms
she
abandoned
herself
to
a
transport
of
gratitude
and
happiness
in
which
her
usual
fortitude
melted
away
the
next
morning
she
had
the
appearance
of
one
doomed
to
death
her
eyes
avoided
everybody
not
only
her
husband
and
lucy
but
myself
as
well
she
pleaded
indisposition
max
left
for
the
synagogue
as
he
always
did
on
saturday
morning
i
accompanied
him
out
of
the
house
on
my
way
to
business
we
parted
at
a
corner
where
i
was
to
wait
for
a
instead
of
boarding
a
car
however
i
returned
home
i
was
burning
to
be
alone
with
dora
to
cuddle
her
out
of
her
forlorn
mood
i
have
come
back
for
a
minute
just
to
tell
you
how
dear
you
are
to
me
i
whispered
to
her
in
the
presence
of
the
children
who
were
having
their
breakfast
i
signed
to
her
to
follow
me
into
the
parlor
and
she
did
just
one
kiss
dearest
i
said
clasping
her
to
me
and
kissing
her
i
let
myself
be
cut
to
pieces
for
you
she
nestled
to
me
for
a
moment
gave
me
a
hasty
kiss
and
ran
back
to
the
children
all
without
looking
at
me
i
went
away
with
a
broken
heart
late
that
evening
when
we
found
ourselves
alone
and
i
rushed
at
her
she
gently
pushed
me
off
why
what
the
trouble
i
asked
no
trouble
at
all
she
answered
looking
down
with
shamefaced
gravity
do
you
hate
me
hate
you
i
wish
i
could
she
answered
with
a
sad
smile
still
looking
down
why
this
new
way
then
i
said
rather
impatiently
you
are
dearer
than
ever
to
me
levinsky
tell
me
to
jump
into
fire
and
i
will
but
ca
we
love
each
other
and
be
good
what
are
you
talking
about
dora
what
has
got
into
you
do
you
know
what
you
are
to
me
now
i
demanded
melodramatically
i
made
another
attempt
at
kissing
her
but
was
repulsed
again
not
now
anyway
my
loved
one
she
said
entreatingly
let
a
few
days
pass
you
do
want
me
to
feel
bad
do
you
dearest
i
looked
sheepish
i
was
convinced
that
it
was
merely
a
passing
mood

next
monday
when
i
was
ready
to
go
to
my
place
of
business
dora
left
the
house
pitcher
in
hand
before
i
rose
from
the
she
was
going
for
milk
but
a
which
she
cast
at
the
floor
in
my
direction
as
she
turned
to
shut
the
door
behind
her
told
me
that
she
wanted
to
see
me
in
the
street
after
letting
some
minutes
pass
i
put
on
my
overcoat
and
hat
bade
max
a
studiously
casual
and
departed
i
awaited
her
on
the
stoop
presently
she
emerged
from
the
grocery
in
the
adjoining
building
could
you
be
free
at
this
afternoon
she
asked
ascending
the
few
steps
and
pausing
by
my
side
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
somewhere
else
not
at
home
why
not
at
home
in
the
evening
no
that
wo
do
she
overruled
me
softly
somebody
might
come
in
and
interrupt
me
i
wait
for
you
in
the
little
park
on
second
avenue
and
fifteenth
street
you
know
the
place
do
you
she
meant
stuyvesant
park
which
the
sunny
second
avenue
cuts
in
two
and
she
explained
that
our
meeting
was
to
take
place
on
the
west
side
of
the
thoroughfare
will
you
come
she
asked
nervously
i
will
i
will
but
what
up
why
do
you
look
so
serious
dora
dora
mine
you
had
better
go
when
we
meet
i
explain
everything
at
then
do
forget
as
you
come
up
the
avenue
going
it
is
on
the
side
write
it
down
to
insure
against
any
mistakes
on
my
part
she
made
me
repeat
it
and
then
jot
it
down
as
she
turned
to
go
upstairs
she
said
in
a
melancholy
whisper
dearest
when
i
reached
the
appointed
place
the
brass
hands
of
the
clock
on
the
steeple
high
overhead
indicated
ten
minutes
of
it
was
june
but
the
day
was
a
typical
november
day
mildly
warm
clear
and
charged
with
the
exhilarating
breath
of
a
new
york
autumn
dora
had
not
yet
arrived
the
benches
in
the
little
park
were
for
the
most
part
occupied
by
housewives
or
who
sat
gossiping
in
front
of
amid
the
noise
of
romping
children
here
and
there
an
elderly
man
sat
smoking
his
pipe
broodingly
they
were
mostly
germans
or
czechs
there
were
scarcely
any
of
our
people
in
the
neighborhood
at
the
period
in
question
and
that
was
why
dora
had
selected
the
place
i
stood
outside
the
iron
gate
gazing
down
the
avenue
the
minutes
were
insupportably
long
at
last
her
womanly
figure
came
into
dim
view
my
heart
leaped
i
was
in
a
flutter
of
mixed
anxiety
and
joyous
anticipation
oh
she
back
down
i
persuaded
myself
she
was
walking
fast
apparently
under
the
impression
that
she
was
late
her
face
was
growing
more
distinct
every
moment
the
blue
hat
she
wore
and
the
parasol
she
carried
gave
her
a
new
aspect
i
had
more
than
once
seen
her
leave
the
house
in
street
array
but
watching
her
come
up
the
street
thus
formally
attired
somehow
gave
her
a
different
appearance
she
looked
so
peculiarly
dignified
and
so
exquisitely
she
almost
seemed
to
be
a
stranger
this
added
to
her
romantic
estrangement
from
me
and
to
the
clandestine
nature
of
our
tryst
produced
a
singular
effect
upon
me
am
i
very
late
she
asked
no
not
at
all
dora
i
said
yearningly
she
made
no
answer
we
could
not
find
an
empty
bench
and
to
let
germans
overhear
our
yiddish
which
is
merely
a
german
dialect
would
have
been
rather
risky
so
she
delivered
her
message
as
we
walked
round
and
round
both
of
us
eying
the
asphalt
all
the
while
her
beautiful
complexion
and
our
manner
attracted
much
attention
the
people
on
the
benches
apparently
divined
the
romantic
nature
of
our
interview
one
little
man
with
a
terrier
face
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
first
of
all
i
want
to
tell
you
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
days
in
my
life
she
began
it
is
certainly
not
a
happy
day
yom
kippur
note
with
me
i
want
to
say
right
here
that
i
am
willing
to
die
for
you
levinsky
i
am
terribly
in
love
with
you
levinsky
yes
her
voice
broke
she
was
confused
and
agitated
but
she
soon
regained
her
she
spoke
in
sad
solemn
quietly
passionate
tones
and
gradually
developed
a
homespun
sort
of
eloquence
which
i
had
never
heard
from
her
before
but
then
the
gift
of
homely
rhetoric
is
rather
a
common
talent
among
women
the
revolting
sight
of
the
old
fellow
who
was
ogling
dora
so
fascinated
me
that
it
interfered
with
my
listening
i
made
a
point
of
looking
away
from
him
every
time
we
came
round
to
his
bench
but
that
only
kept
me
thinking
of
him
instead
of
listening
to
dora
finally
we
confined
our
walk
to
the
farther
side
of
the
little
park
giving
him
a
wide
berth
i
love
you
more
than
i
can
tell
you
levinsky
she
resumed
but
it
is
not
my
good
luck
to
be
happy
i
dreamed
all
my
life
of
love
and
now
that
it
is
here
right
here
in
my
heart
i
must
choke
it
with
my
own
hands
why
why
i
said
with
vehemence
why
must
you
why
she
echoed
bitterly
because
the
upper
one
brought
you
to
me
only
to
punish
me
to
tease
me
that
all
that
all
all
why
should
you
take
it
that
way
do
interrupt
me
levinsky
she
said
chanting
rather
than
speaking
as
she
proceeded
her
voice
lapsed
into
a
quaint
doleful
singsong
not
unlike
the
lament
of
our
women
over
a
grave
no
levinsky
it
is
not
given
to
me
to
be
happy
but
i
ask
no
questions
of
the
upper
one
i
used
to
live
in
peace
i
was
not
happy
but
i
lived
in
peace
i
did
not
know
what
happiness
was
so
i
did
not
miss
it
much
i
only
dreamed
of
it
but
the
lord
of
the
world
would
have
me
taste
it
so
that
i
might
miss
it
and
that
my
heart
might
be
left
with
a
big
big
wound
i
want
you
to
know
exactly
how
i
feel
oh
if
i
could
turn
this
poor
heart
of
mine
inside
out
then
you
could
see
all
that
is
going
on
there
listen
levinsky
if
it
were
not
for
my
children
my
dear
children
my
all
in
all
in
the
world
i
should
not
live
with
margolis
another
day
if
he
gave
me
a
divorce
well
and
good
if
not
then
i
do
know
what
i
might
do
i
should
care
i
love
you
so
and
i
want
to
be
happy
i
do
i
do
i
do
a
sob
rang
through
her
voice
as
she
repeated
the
words
you
do
and
yet
you
are
bound
to
make
both
of
us
miserable
i
said
can
i
help
it
if
you
would
you
could
i
said
grimly
get
a
divorce
and
let
us
be
married
and
have
it
over
she
shook
her
head
sadly
thousands
of
couples
get
divorced
she
kept
shaking
her
head
then
what
the
use
pretending
you
love
me
pretending
shall
i
turn
my
heart
inside
out
to
show
you
how
hard
it
is
to
live
without
you
but
you
ca
understand
no
levinsky
i
have
no
right
to
be
happy
lucy
shall
be
happy
she
certainly
marry
without
love
her
happiness
will
be
mine
too
the
only
kind
i
am
entitled
to
she
shall
go
to
college
she
shall
be
educated
she
shall
marry
the
loved
one
of
her
heart
she
shall
not
be
buried
alive
as
her
mother
was
let
her
profit
by
what
little
sense
i
have
been
able
to
pick
up
a
bench
became
vacant
and
we
occupied
it
the
momentary
interruption
and
the
change
in
her
physical
attitude
broke
the
spell
the
solemnity
was
gone
out
of
her
voice
she
resumed
in
a
distracted
and
somewhat
listless
manner
but
she
soon
warmed
up
again
what
would
you
have
me
do
let
lucy
find
out
some
day
that
her
mother
was
a
bad
woman
i
should
take
poison
first
a
bad
woman
i
protested
a
better
woman
could
not
be
found
anywhere
in
the
world
you
are
a
saint
dora
no
i
am
not
i
am
a
bad
wicked
nasty
woman
i
hate
myself
you
must
speak
like
that
i
said
stopping
my
i
can
not
bear
it
yes
that
what
i
am
a
nasty
creature
i
used
to
be
pure
as
gold
there
was
not
a
speck
on
my
soul
and
now
woe
is
me
pain
is
me
what
has
come
over
me
when
she
finally
got
down
to
the
practical
side
of
her
resolution
it
turned
out
that
she
wanted
me
to
move
out
of
her
house
and
never
to
see
her
again
i
was
shocked
i
flouted
the
idea
of
it
i
argued
i
poured
out
my
lovelorn
heart
but
she
insisted
with
an
finality
i
argued
again
entreated
raved
all
to
no
purpose
i
never
come
close
to
you
all
i
want
is
to
be
able
to
see
you
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
you
do
be
tearing
my
heart
to
pieces
she
said
it
is
torn
badly
enough
as
it
is
do
as
i
say
levinsky
do
you
want
to
see
me
at
all
oh
it
cruel
of
you
to
ask
questions
like
that
you
have
no
heart
levinsky
it
just
because
i
am
crazy
to
see
you
that
you
have
got
to
move
do
you
want
me
even
to
call
at
your
house
i
asked
with
an
ironical
smile
as
though
i
did
not
take
the
matter
seriously
well
that
would
look
strange
call
sometimes
not
often
though
and
never
when
margolis
is
out
oh
i
shall
commit
suicide
i
snarled
oh
well
it
is
as
bad
as
all
that
i
will
i
certainly
will
i
said
knowing
that
i
was
talking
nonsense
do
torment
me
levinsky
do
sprinkle
salt
over
my
wound
take
pity
on
me
do
as
i
wish
and
let
the
tooth
be
pulled
out
with
as
little
pain
as
possible
i
accompanied
her
down
the
avenue
as
far
as
houston
street
where
she
insisted
upon
our
parting
before
we
did
however
she
indulged
in
another
outburst
of
funereal
oratory
bewailing
her
happiness
as
she
would
a
dead
child
it
was
apparently
not
easy
for
her
to
take
leave
of
me
but
her
purpose
to
make
our
romance
a
thing
of
the
past
and
to
have
me
move
to
other
lodgings
remained
unshaken
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
ever
speak
to
you
of
my
love
levinsky
she
said
i
must
tear
it
out
of
my
heart
even
if
i
have
to
tear
out
a
piece
of
my
heart
along
with
it
such
is
my
fate
levinsky
good
luck
to
you
be
good
be
good
be
good
remember
you
have
a
good
head
waste
no
time
study
as
much
as
you
can
god
grant
you
luck
in
your
business
but
try
to
find
time
for
your
books
too
you
must
become
a
great
man
do
you
promise
me
to
read
and
study
a
lot
i
do
i
do
but
i
wo
move
out
i
ca
live
without
you
we
belong
to
each
other
and
all
you
say
is
nothing
but
a
whim
it
all
bosh
i
concluded
with
an
air
of
masculine
superiority
i
wo
move
out
you
shall
dearest
she
broke
into
a
fit
of
sobbing
but
checked
it
shook
my
hand
vehemently
and
hastened
away
note

figuratively
a
day
of

and

chapter
xix
i
hoped
she
would
yield
but
she
did
not
i
found
myself
in
the
grip
of
an
iron
will
and
i
did
as
i
was
bidden
when
i
set
out
in
quest
of
a
furnished
room
i
instinctively
betook
myself
to
the
neighborhood
of
stuyvesant
park
that
park
had
acquired
a
melancholy
fascination
for
me
as
though
to
make
amends
for
my
agonies
i
determined
to
move
into
a
good
spacious
room
even
if
i
had
to
pay
three
or
four
times
as
much
as
i
had
been
paying
at
the
margolises
i
found
a
sunny
front
room
with
two
windows
in
an
old
house
on
east
nineteenth
street
between
second
avenue
and
first
a
short
distance
from
the
little
park
and
near
an
elevated
station
the
curtains
the
carpet
the
huge
soft
and
the
lounge
struck
me
as
decidedly
aristocratic
to
cap
the
climax
of
comfort
and
swellness
the
landlady
a
gray
little
had
at
my
request
a
bookcase
placed
between
the
mantelpiece
and
one
of
the
windows
it
was
a
regular
bookcase
doors
and
all
not
a
mere
and
the
sight
of
it
swelled
my
breast
i
shall
forget
all
my
troubles
here
i
thought
i
am
going
to
buy
a
complete
set
of
spencer
and
some
other
books
wo
the
bookcase
look
fine
i
shall
read
read
read
when
i
reported
to
dora
that
i
was
ready
to
move
her
face
clouded
you
seem
to
be
glad
to
she
said
with
venom
dropping
her
eyes
glad
glad
why
i
am
not
going
to
move
then
may
i
stay
here
darling
mine
may
i
are
you
really
sorry
you
have
to
move
she
asked
fixing
a
loving
glance
at
me
do
you
really
love
me
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
i
attempted
to
come
close
to
her
to
kiss
her
but
she
held
me
back
no
dearest
she
said
shaking
her
head
move
out
will
you
let
be
done
with
it
and
what
will
max
say
i
asked
sardonically
will
nothing
seem
strange
to
him
nothing
at
all
never
mind
that
she
never
mentioned
max
to
me
now
not
even
by
pronoun
then
you
must
know
him
to
be
an
idiot
now
i
hated
max
with
all
my
heart
do
she
implored
oh
i
see
he
dear
to
you
now
i
laughed
have
a
heart
levinsky
have
a
heart
must
you
keep
shedding
my
blood
have
you
no
pity
at
all
but
it
is
all
so
ridiculous
it
will
look
strange
i
argued
seriously
he
is
bound
to
get
suspicious
i
have
thought
it
all
out
do
be
uneasy
i
say
we
had
a
quarrel
over
your
board
bill
a
nice
dodge
indeed
it
may
fool
dannie
not
him
leave
it
all
to
me
better
tell
me
what
sort
of
lodgings
you
have
got
is
it
a
decent
room
plenty
of
air
and
sunshine
but
no
tell
me
anything
i
must
know
i
sneered
she
was
absorbed
in
thought
flushed
nervous
presently
she
said
with
an
effect
of
speaking
to
herself
it
sweet
to
suffer
for
what
is
right
i
moved
out
according
to
her
program
i
came
home
at
the
first
evening
my
double
room
with
its
great
carpets
bookcase
imposing
lace
curtains
and
the
genteel
silence
of
the
street
outside
was
a
prison
to
me
i
attempted
to
read
but
there
was
a
lump
in
my
throat
and
the
lines
swam
before
me
i
went
out
roamed
about
the
streets
dropped
in
at
a
hungarian
café
took
another
ramble
and
returned
to
my
room
i
tossed
about
on
my
great
double
bed
i
sat
up
in
front
of
one
of
my
two
windows
gazing
at
a
it
was
not
solely
dora
but
also
lucy
and
dannie
that
i
missed
only
the
image
of
max
now
aroused
hostile
feelings
in
me
max
called
at
my
shop
the
very
next
day
the
sight
of
him
cut
me
to
the
quick
i
received
him
in
morose
silence
what
the
matter
what
the
matter
he
inquired
with
pained
amazement
what
did
you
two
quarrel
about
i
made
no
answer
his
presence
oppressed
me
my
surly
reticence
was
no
mere
acting
but
i
knew
that
he
misinterpreted
it
into
grim
resentment
of
dora
sally
as
though
i
said
your
wife
conduct
had
better
be
left
undiscussed
what
nonsense
she
charged
you
too
much
did
she
is
that
the
way
it
all
began
did
she
insult
you
well
are
liable
to
flare
up
you
know
tell
me
all
about
it
i
straighten
it
out
between
you
the
children
miss
you
awfully
come
do
be
a
fool
levinsky
who
ever
took
the
words
of
a
woman
seriously
what
did
she
say
that
you
should
take
it
so
hard
you
had
better
ask
her
i
replied
with
a
frown
ask
her
she
gets
wild
when
i
do
i
never
saw
her
so
wild
she
thinks
you
insulted
her
first
well
she
is
a
woman
but
you
one
are
you
come
to
the
house
this
evening
will
you
that
out
of
the
question
then
meet
me
somewhere
else
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
all
so
foolish
i
pleaded
important
other
engagements
but
he
insisted
that
i
should
meet
him
later
in
the
evening
and
i
had
to
make
the
appointment
i
promised
to
be
at
a
canal
street
café
on
condition
that
he
did
not
mention
the
disagreeable
episode
nor
offer
to
effect
a
reconciliation
between
dora
and
myself
you
a
tough
customer
as
tough
as
dora
he
said
when
i
came
to
the
café
at
about
i
found
him
waiting
for
me
he
kept
his
promise
about
avoiding
the
subject
of
dora
but
he
talked
of
women
which
jarred
on
me
inordinately
now
his
lecherous
fibs
and
philosophy
made
him
literally
unbearable
to
me
to
turn
the
conversation
i
talked
shop
and
this
bored
him
about
a
week
later
he
called
on
me
again
he
informed
me
that
dora
had
taken
a
new
apartment
up
in
harlem
where
the
rooms
were
even
more
modern
and
cheaper
than
on
clinton
street
i
would
mind
staying
where
we
are
he
observed
but
you
know
how
women
are
everybody
is
moving
so
she
must
move
too
my
face
hardened
as
if
to
say
why
will
you
speak
of
your
wife
you
know
i
ca
bear
to
hear
of
her
at
the
same
time
i
said
to
myself
poor
dora
she
must
have
found
it
awful
to
live
in
the
old
place
now
that
i
am
no
longer
there
his
next
visit
at
my
shop
took
place
after
a
lapse
of
three
or
four
weeks
he
descanted
upon
his
new
home
and
the
harlem
dwellings
in
general
and
i
made
an
effort
to
show
him
cordial
attention
and
to
bear
myself
generally
as
though
there
were
no
cause
for
estrangement
between
us
but
i
failed
at
last
he
said
resentfully
what
the
matter
with
you
why
are
you
so
sour
if
you
and
dora
have
had
a
falling
out
is
that
any
reason
why
you
and
i
should
not
be
good
friends
why
why
i
protested
who
says
i
am
sour
we
parted
on
very
friendly
terms
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
saw
him
again
and
then
under
circumstances
that
were
a
disagreeable
surprise
to
me
book
x
on
the
road
chapter
i
weeks
went
by
my
desolation
seemed
to
be
growing
in
excruciating
intensity
from
time
to
time
when
i
chanced
to
recall
some
trait
or
trick
of
dora
her
person
would
come
back
to
me
with
special
vividness
smiting
me
with
sudden
cruelty
the
very
odor
of
her
flesh
would
grip
my
consciousness
at
such
moments
my
agony
would
be
so
great
that
i
seemed
to
be
on
the
brink
of
a
physical
collapse
during
intervals
there
was
a
steady
gnawing
pain
it
was
as
though
the
unrelenting
tortures
of
a
dull
toothache
had
settled
somewhere
in
the
region
of
my
heart
or
stomach
i
knew
not
exactly
where
i
recognized
the
pang
as
an
old
acquaintance
it
had
the
same
flavor
as
the
terrors
of
my
tantalizing
love
for
matilda
my
shop
had
lost
all
meaning
to
me
i
vaguely
longed
to
flee
from
myself
there
was
plenty
to
do
in
the
shop
and
all
sorts
of
outside
appointments
to
keep
not
to
speak
of
my
brief
trips
as
traveling
salesman
to
all
of
which
i
attended
with
automatic
regularity
with
listless
doggedness
the
union
was
a
constant
source
of
worry
in
addition
there
was
a
hitch
in
my
relations
with
the
marriage
broker
but
even
my
worrying
seemed
to
be
done
automatically
having
forfeited
the
invaluable
services
of
chaikin
who
now
gave
all
his
time
to
his
newly
established
factory
i
filled
the
gap
with
all
sorts
of
makeshifts
and
contrivances
an
employee
of
one
of
the
big
shops
a
tailor
stole
designs
for
me
these
were
used
in
my
shop
by
a
old
tailor
with
a
beard
full
of
snuff
who
would
have
become
a
chaikin
if
he
had
been
twenty
years
younger
later
i
hired
the
services
of
a
newly
graduated
who
would
drop
in
of
an
afternoon
officially
the
old
man
was
my
foreman
but
in
reality
he
acted
as
a
guiding
spirit
to
that
designer
and
one
of
my
as
well
as
foreman
i
was
forming
new
connections
obtaining
orders
from
new
sources
things
were
coming
my
way
in
spite
of
myself
as
it
were
there
was
so
much
work
and
bustle
that
it
became
next
to
impossible
to
manage
it
all
the
need
of
a
bookkeeper
at
least
was
felt
more
keenly
every
day
but
i
simply
lacked
the
initiative
to
get
one
while
i
was
thus
cudgeling
my
brains
hovering
about
my
shop
meeting
people
signing
checks
reading
or
writing
letters
that
dull
pain
would
keep
nibbling
nibbling
nibbling
at
me
at
times
during
some
of
those
violent
onslaughts
i
would
seek
the
partial
privacy
of
my
desk
for
the
express
purpose
of
abandoning
myself
to
the
tortures
of
my
helpless
love
there
is
pleasure
in
this
kind
of
pain
it
was
as
though
i
were
two
men
at
once
one
being
in
the
toils
of
hopeless
love
and
the
other
filled
with
the
joy
of
loving
all
injunctions
and
barriers
notwithstanding
one
october
evening
as
i
passed
through
the
grand
central
station
on
my
way
from
an
albany
train
i
was
hailed
with
an
impulsive
hello
levinsky
it
was
bender
my
instructor
i
had
not
seen
him
for
more
than
three
years
during
which
time
he
had
developed
a
pronounced
tendency
to
baldness
though
his
apple
face
had
lost
none
of
its
roseate
freshness
he
looked
spruce
as
ever
his
clothes
spick
and
span
his
tastefully
tied
his
collar
and
cuffs
immaculate
his
hazel
eyes
however
had
a
worn
and
wistful
look
in
them
quite
an
american
i
declare
he
exclaimed
with
patronizing
admiration
and
pride
as
who
should
say
my
work
has
borne
fruit
has
it
well
how
is
the
world
treating
you
he
questioned
me
after
having
looked
me
over
more
carefully
you
seem
to
be
doing
well
when
he
heard
that
i
was
trying
to
manufacture
cloaks
and
suits
he
surveyed
me
once
again
with
novel
interest
are
you
really
that
good
glad
to
hear
you
getting
on
in
the
world
do
you
remember
the
two
books
you
gave
me
dombey
and
son
and
the
little
dictionary
i
told
him
how
much
good
they
had
done
me
and
he
complimented
me
on
my
english
he
wanted
to
know
more
about
my
business
and
i
sketched
for
him
my
struggles
during
the
first
year
and
the
progress
i
was
now
making
my
narrative
was
interspersed
with
such
phrases
as
my
growing
credit
my
in
my
desk
dinner
with
a
buyer
from
ohio
all
of
which
i
uttered
with
great
he
congratulated
me
upon
my
success
and
upon
my
english
again
whereupon
i
exuberantly
acknowledged
the
gratitude
i
owed
him
for
the
special
pains
he
had
taken
with
me
when
i
was
his
pupil
he
still
taught
evening
school
during
the
winter
months
when
i
asked
about
his
work
at
the
which
had
been
his
chief
occupation
three
years
before
he
answered
evasively
by
little
and
little
however
he
threw
off
his
reserve
and
told
at
first
with
studied
flippancy
and
then
with
frank
bitterness
how
the
new
republican
broom
swept
clean
and
how
he
had
lost
his
job
because
of
his
loyalty
to
the
democratic
party
he
dwelt
on
the
reform
of
president
cleveland
charging
the
republicans
with
offensive
partisanship
a
cleveland
phrase
then
as
new
as
neckties
and
in
the
next
breath
he
proceeded
to
describe
certain
injustices
of
which
he
apparently
considered
himself
a
victim
within
the
fold
of
his
own
party
his
immediate
ambition
was
to
obtain
a
permanent
appointment
as
teacher
of
a
public
day
school
he
was
a
singular
surprise
to
me
formerly
i
had
looked
up
to
him
as
infinitely
my
superior
whereas
now
he
struck
me
as
being
piteously
beneath
me
ca
you
think
of
something
better
i
said
with
mild
contempt
then
with
a
sudden
inspiration
i
exclaimed
i
have
a
scheme
for
you
bender
suppose
you
try
to
sell
cloaks
there
lots
of
money
in
it
the
outcome
of
our
conversation
was
that
he
agreed
to
spend
a
week
or
two
in
my
shop
preparatory
to
soliciting
orders
for
me
at
first
in
the
city
and
then
on
the
road
our
interview
lasted
a
little
over
an
hour
but
that
hour
produced
a
world
of
difference
in
our
relations
he
had
met
me
with
a
patronizing
hello
levinsky
when
we
parted
there
was
a
note
of
gratitude
and
of
something
like
obsequiousness
in
his
voice
chapter
ii
on
a
friday
afternoon
during
the
first
week
of
bender
connection
with
my
establishment
as
he
and
i
were
crossing
a
on
our
way
from
luncheon
i
ran
into
the
loosely
built
bulky
figure
of
max
margolis
max
and
i
paused
with
a
start
both
embarrassed
i
greeted
him
complaisantly
and
how
are
you
he
said
looking
at
the
lower
part
of
my
face
i
introduced
my
companion
and
after
a
brief
exchange
of
trivialities
we
were
about
to
part
when
max
detained
me
wait
what
your
hurry
he
said
there
is
something
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
in
fact
it
was
to
your
shop
i
was
going
his
manner
disturbed
me
were
you
come
on
then
i
said
hold
on
what
your
hurry
we
might
as
well
talk
here
bender
tipped
his
hat
to
him
and
moved
away
leaving
us
to
ourselves
what
is
it
i
repeated
with
studied
indifference
well
i
should
like
to
have
a
plain
frank
talk
with
you
levinsky
he
answered
there
is
something
that
is
bothering
my
mind
i
never
thought
i
should
speak
to
you
about
it
but
at
last
i
decided
to
see
you
and
have
it
out
i
was
going
to
call
on
you
and
to
ask
you
to
go
out
with
me
because
you
have
no
private
office
there
was
a
nervous
kind
of
air
about
him
his
damp
lips
revolted
me
but
what
is
it
what
are
all
these
preliminaries
for
come
to
the
point
and
be
done
with
it
what
is
it
then
i
asked
with
indignation
your
wife
has
not
persuaded
you
that
i
have
cheated
her
out
of
some
money
has
she
why
no
not
at
all
he
answered
looking
at
the
pavement
it
is
that
at
all
the
thing
is
driving
me
mad
but
what
is
it
i
shouted
in
a
rage
he
said
nervously
if
you
are
going
to
be
excited
like
that
it
no
use
speaking
at
all
perhaps
you
are
doing
it
on
purpose
to
get
out
of
it
get
out
of
what
what
on
earth
are
you
prating
about
i
demanded
with
a
fine
display
of
perplexity
and
sarcasm
we
were
attracting
attention
bystanders
were
eying
us
an
old
woman
leading
a
boy
by
the
hand
even
paused
to
watch
us
and
then
her
example
was
followed
by
some
others
come
on
for
god
sake
he
implored
me
all
i
want
is
a
friendly
talk
with
you
we
might
talk
in
your
shop
but
you
have
no
private
office
whether
i
have
one
or
not
is
none
of
your
business
i
retorted
with
irrelevant
resentment
we
walked
on
he
proposed
to
take
me
to
one
of
the
ball
and
places
in
which
he
did
business
and
i
acquiesced
a
few
minutes
later
we
were
seated
on
a
long
cushion
of
red
plush
covering
one
of
the
benches
in
a
long
narrow
we
were
close
to
the
window
in
the
full
glare
of
daylight
a
few
feet
off
the
room
was
in
which
still
farther
off
lapsed
into
night
as
the
plush
cushions
stretched
their
lengths
into
the
deepening
gloom
their
live
red
died
away
there
was
a
touch
of
weirdness
to
the
scene
adding
to
the
oppressiveness
of
the
interview
i
want
to
ask
you
a
plain
question
he
began
in
a
strange
voice
and
i
want
you
to
answer
it
frankly
i
assure
you
i
be
angry
on
the
contrary
i
shall
be
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
tell
me
the
whole
truth
tell
me
what
happened
between
you
and
dora
i
was
about
to
burst
into
laughter
but
i
felt
that
it
would
not
do
before
i
knew
how
to
act
he
added
with
a
sort
of
solemnity
she
has
confessed
everything
confessed
everything
i
exclaimed
with
a
feigned
compound
of
hauteur
indignation
and
amusement
playing
for
time
that
what
she
did
a
frenzy
of
hate
took
hold
of
me
i
panted
to
be
away
from
him
to
be
out
of
this
room
red
cushions
and
all
and
let
the
future
take
care
of
itself
and
so
jumping
to
my
feet
i
said
in
a
fury
you
always
were
a
liar
and
an
idiot
i
do
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
with
which
i
made
for
the
door
oh
do
be
excited
do
go
yet
levinsky
dear
please
he
implored
hysterically
running
after
me
i
have
the
best
of
feelings
for
you
may
the
things
that
i
wish
you
come
to
me
levinsky
dear
friend
darling
what
do
you
want
of
me
i
demanded
with
quiet
rancor
pausing
at
the
door
and
half
opening
it
without
moving
on
if
you
tell
me
it
is
true
i
believe
you
even
if
she
did
confess
i
do
know
if
she
meant
what
she
said
if
only
you
were
not
excited
i
want
to
tell
you
everything
everything
i
laughed
sardonically
my
desire
to
escape
the
ordeal
gave
way
to
strange
curiosity
he
seemed
to
be
aware
of
it
for
he
boldly
shut
the
door
he
begged
me
to
take
a
seat
again
and
i
did
a
short
distance
from
the
door
where
the
gloom
was
almost
thick
enough
to
hide
our
faces
from
each
other
view
why
you
are
simply
crazy
max
i
said
you
probably
bothered
the
life
out
of
her
and
she
to
put
an
end
to
it
all
you
might
as
well
have
made
her
confess
to
murder
that
what
she
says
now
but
i
do
know
when
she
confessed
she
confessed
i
could
see
it
was
the
truth
you
are
crazy
max
it
is
all
nonsense
is
it
he
demanded
straining
to
make
out
the
expression
of
my
face
through
the
dusk
do
assure
me
it
is
all
untrue
take
pity
dear
friend
do
take
pity
how
can
i
assure
you
seeing
that
you
have
taken
that
crazy
notion
into
your
head
and
do
seem
to
be
able
to
get
rid
of
it
come
throw
that
stuff
out
of
your
mind
i
scolded
him
mentorially
it
enough
to
make
one
sick
come
to
reason
be
a
fool
i
am
no
saint
but
in
this
case
you
are
absolutely
mistaken
why
dora
is
such
an
absolutely
respectable
woman
a
fellow
would
never
dare
have
the
slightest
kind
of
fun
with
her
the
idea
with
a
little
laugh
you
are
a
baby
max
upon
my
word
you
are
dora
and
i
had
some
words
over
my
bill
and
well
she
insulted
me
and
i
would
take
it
from
her
that
all
there
was
to
it
why
look
here
max
with
your
knowledge
of
men
and
women
do
you
mean
to
say
that
something
was
going
on
under
your
very
nose
and
you
never
noticed
anything
do
you
see
how
ridiculous
it
is
well
i
believe
you
levinsky
he
said
lukewarmly
now
that
you
assure
me
you
do
know
anything
about
it
i
believe
you
i
know
you
are
not
an
enemy
of
mine
i
have
always
considered
you
a
true
friend
you
know
i
have
that
why
i
am
having
this
talk
with
you
i
am
feeling
better
already
but
you
have
no
idea
what
i
have
been
through
the
last
few
weeks
she
is
so
dear
to
me
i
love
her
so
his
voice
broke
i
was
seized
with
a
feeling
of
mixed
abomination
and
sympathy
you
are
a
child
i
said
taking
him
by
the
hand
as
i
did
so
every
vestige
of
hostility
faded
out
of
me
my
heart
went
out
to
him
come
max
pull
yourself
together
be
a
man
i
have
always
known
you
to
be
my
friend
i
believe
all
you
say
i
first
began
to
think
of
this
trouble
a
few
days
after
you
moved
out
but
at
first
i
made
no
fuss
about
it
i
thought
she
was
not
well
i
came
to
see
you
a
few
times
and
you
did
not
behave
like
a
fellow
who
was
guilty
i
gave
a
silent
little
laugh
he
related
certain
intimate
incidents
which
had
aroused
his
first
twinge
of
suspicion
he
was
revoltingly
frank
i
spoke
to
her
plainly
he
said
the
matter
with
you
dora
i
asked
her
you
like
me
any
more
and
she
got
wild
and
said
she
hated
me
like
poison
she
never
talked
to
me
like
that
before
it
was
a
different
dora
she
was
always
downhearted
cranky
the
slightest
thing
made
her
yell
or
cry
with
tears
it
got
worse
and
worse
oh
it
was
terrible
we
quarreled
twenty
times
a
day
and
the
children
cried
and
i
thought
i
was
going
mad
maybe
she
was
just
missing
you
you
were
like
one
of
the
family
do
you
know
and
well
you
are
a
fellow
levinsky
and
she
is
only
a
woman
nonsense
i
returned
the
hot
color
mounting
to
my
cheeks
i
am
sure
dora
had
not
a
bad
thought
in
her
mind
but
she
confessed
he
interrupted
me
she
said
she
was
crazy
for
you
and
i
could
do
as
i
pleased
but
you
know
she
did
not
mean
it
she
said
it
just
for
spite
just
to
make
you
feel
bad
because
you
were
quarreling
with
her
he
quoted
a
brutal
question
which
he
had
once
put
to
her
concerning
her
relations
with
me
and
then
he
quoted
dora
as
answering
yes
yes
yes
and
if
you
do
like
it
you
can
sue
me
for
divorce
i
laughed
making
my
merriment
as
realistic
as
i
could
it
all
ridiculous
nonsense
max
i
said
you
made
life
miserable
to
her
and
she
was
ready
to
say
anything
she
may
have
been
worried
over
something
and
you
imagined
all
sorts
of
things
maybe
it
was
something
about
her
education
that
worried
her
you
know
how
ambitious
she
is
to
be
educated
and
how
hard
she
takes
these
things
max
shook
his
head
pensively
i
am
sure
it
is
as
i
say
i
continued
dora
is
a
peculiar
woman
the
trouble
is
you
judge
her
as
if
she
were
like
the
other
women
you
meet
hers
is
a
different
character
this
point
apparently
interested
him
she
is
always
taken
up
with
her
thoughts
i
pursued
she
is
not
so
easy
to
understand
anyway
i
lived
over
a
year
in
your
house
and
yet
i
be
hanged
if
i
know
what
kind
of
woman
she
is
of
course
you
her
husband
but
still
can
you
say
you
know
what
she
is
thinking
of
most
of
the
time
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
he
assented
as
we
rose
to
go
he
said
timidly
there
is
only
one
more
question
i
want
to
ask
of
you
levinsky
you
wo
be
angry
will
you
what
is
it
i
demanded
with
a
laugh
what
is
bothering
your
head
i
mean
if
you
meet
her
now
sometimes
now
look
here
max
you
are
simply
crazy
i
said
earnestly
i
swear
to
you
by
my
mother
that
i
have
not
seen
dora
since
i
moved
out
of
your
house
and
that
all
your
suspicions
are
nonsense
to
keep
the
memory
of
my
mother
from
desecration
i
declared
mutely
that
my
oath
referred
to
the
truthful
part
of
my
declaration
only
that
is
exclusively
to
the
fact
that
i
no
longer
met
dora
i
believe
you
i
believe
you
levinsky
he
rejoined
we
parted
more
than
cordially
max
promising
to
call
on
me
again
and
to
spend
an
evening
with
me
i
was
left
in
a
singular
state
of
mind
i
was
eaten
up
with
compunction
and
yet
the
pain
of
my
love
reasserted
itself
with
the
tantalizing
force
of
two
months
before
max
never
called
on
me
again
chapter
iii
as
a
salesman
bender
proved
a
dismal
failure
but
i
retained
him
in
my
employ
as
a
bookkeeper
and
a
sort
of
general
supervisor
i
could
offer
him
only
ten
dollars
a
week
with
a
promise
to
raise
his
salary
as
soon
as
i
could
afford
it
and
he
accepted
the
job
temporarily
as
general
supervisor
under
my
orders
he
developed
considerable
efficiency
although
he
lacked
initiative
and
his
naďveté
was
a
frequent
cause
of
annoyance
to
me
i
found
him
spotlessly
honest
and
devoted
i
quickly
raised
his
salary
to
fifteen
dollars
a
week
he
was
the
embodiment
of
method
and
precision
and
he
often
nagged
me
for
my
deficiency
in
these
qualities
sometimes
these
naggings
of
his
or
some
display
of
poor
judgment
on
his
part
would
give
rise
to
a
tiff
between
us
otherwise
we
got
along
splendidly
we
were
supposed
to
be
great
chums
in
reality
however
i
would
freely
order
him
about
while
he
would
address
me
with
a
familiarity
which
had
an
echo
of
respectful
distance
to
it
with
him
to
take
care
of
my
place
when
i
was
away
it
became
possible
for
me
gradually
to
extend
my
territory
as
traveling
salesman
till
it
reached
nebraska
and
louisiana
thus
having
failed
as
a
drummer
himself
he
made
up
for
it
by
enabling
me
to
act
as
one
he
had
been
less
than
a
year
with
me
when
his
salary
was
twenty
dollars
charles
eaton
the
pennsylvanian
of
the
hemispherical
forehead
and
bushy
eyebrows
who
had
given
me
my
first
lesson
in
restaurant
manners
was
now
my
sponsor
at
the
beginning
of
my
career
as
a
traveling
salesman
he
took
a
warm
interest
in
me
having
spent
many
years
on
the
road
himself
more
particularly
in
the
middle
west
and
canada
he
had
formed
many
a
close
friendship
among
retailers
so
he
now
gave
me
some
valuable
letters
of
intro
duction
to
merchants
in
several
cities
when
i
asked
him
for
suggestions
to
guide
me
on
the
road
he
looked
perplexed
oh
well
i
guess
you
do
well
he
said
still
you
have
had
so
much
experience
mr
eaton
well
i
really
do
know
it
all
a
matter
of
common
sense
i
guess
and
after
all
the
merchandise
is
the
thing
the
merchandise
and
the
price
he
added
a
word
or
two
about
the
futility
of
laying
down
rules
and
that
was
all
i
could
get
out
of
him
that
a
man
of
few
words
like
him
should
have
succeeded
as
a
salesman
was
a
riddle
to
me
i
subsequently
realized
that
his
reticence
accentuated
an
effect
of
solidity
and
helped
to
inspire
confidence
in
the
few
words
which
he
did
utter
but
at
the
time
in
question
i
was
sure
that
the
gift
of
the
gab
was
an
indispensable
element
of
success
in
a
salesman
indeed
one
of
my
faults
as
a
drummer
during
that
period
at
least
was
that
i
was
apt
to
talk
too
much
i
would
do
so
partly
for
the
sheer
lust
of
hearing
myself
use
the
jargon
of
the
market
but
chiefly
of
course
from
eagerness
to
make
a
sale
from
i
was
too
exuberant
in
praising
my
own
goods
and
too
harsh
in
criticising
those
of
my
competitors
altogether
there
was
more
emphasis
than
dignity
in
my
appeal
one
day
as
i
was
haranguing
the
proprietor
of
a
small
department
store
in
a
michigan
town
he
suddenly
interrupted
me
by
placing
a
friendly
hand
on
my
shoulder
his
name
was
henry
gans
he
was
a
stout
man
of
fifty
with
the
stamp
of
american
birth
on
a
strong
jewish
face
let
me
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
young
man
he
said
with
paternal
geniality
you
wo
mind
will
you
i
uttered
a
perplexed
why
no
and
he
proceeded
if
you
want
to
make
good
as
a
salesman
observe
these
two
rules
do
knock
the
other
fellow
and
do
talk
too
much
for
a
minute
i
stood
silent
utterly
nonplussed
then
pulling
myself
together
i
said
with
a
bow
thank
you
sir
thank
you
very
much
i
am
only
a
beginner
and
only
a
few
years
in
the
country
i
know
i
have
still
a
great
deal
to
learn
it
very
kind
of
you
to
point
out
my
mistakes
to
me
the
gay
light
of
gans
eye
gave
way
to
a
look
of
earnestness
it
ai
nice
to
run
down
your
competitor
he
said
besides
it
do
pay
it
makes
a
bad
impression
on
the
man
you
are
trying
to
get
an
order
from
we
had
a
long
conversation
gradually
passing
from
business
to
affairs
of
a
personal
nature
he
was
interested
in
my
early
struggles
in
america
in
my
mode
of
living
in
the
state
of
my
business
and
i
told
him
the
whole
story
he
seemed
to
be
well
disposed
toward
me
but
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
take
my
establishment
seriously
and
i
left
his
store
without
an
order
i
was
berating
myself
for
having
revealed
the
true
size
of
my
business
somehow
my
failure
in
this
instance
galled
me
with
special
poignancy
i
roamed
around
the
streets
casting
about
for
some
scheme
to
make
good
my
mistake
less
than
an
hour
after
i
left
gans
store
i
it
full
of
fresh
spirit
and
pluck
i
beg
your
pardon
for
troubling
you
again
gans
i
began
stopping
him
in
the
middle
of
an
aisle
you
been
so
kind
to
me
i
should
like
to
ask
you
one
more
question
only
one
i
trust
i
am
not
intruding
go
ahead
he
said
patiently
i
shall
do
as
you
advise
me
i
shall
never
knock
the
other
fellow
i
began
with
a
smile
but
suppose
his
merchandise
is
really
good
and
i
can
outbid
him
why
should
it
not
be
proper
for
me
to
say
so
if
you
permit
me
pointing
at
one
of
the
suits
displayed
in
the
store
a
brown
cheviot
trimmed
with
velvet
take
that
suit
for
instance
it
certainly
a
fine
garment
it
has
style
and
dash
really
a
beautiful
garment
i
have
the
least
idea
how
much
you
pay
for
it
of
course
but
i
do
know
that
i
could
make
you
the
identical
coat
for
a
much
smaller
price
so
why
should
it
be
right
for
me
to
say
so
he
contemplated
me
for
a
moment
broke
into
a
hearty
laugh
and
said
you
a
pretty
shrewd
fellow
why
of
course
nothing
wrong
in
selling
cheaper
than
your
competitor
what
we
all
trying
to
do
that
the
game
provided
you
really
can
sell
cheaper
than
the
other
man
and
there
are
no
other
drawbacks
in
doing
business
with
you
what
i
said
about
the
brown
suit
piqued
him
he
had
his
bookkeeper
show
me
the
bill
and
defied
me
to
sell
him
a
garment
of
exactly
the
same
material
cut
and
workmanship
for
less
i
accepted
the
challenge
offering
to
reduce
the
price
by
four
dollars
and
a
half
before
i
had
any
idea
whether
i
could
afford
to
do
so
i
was
ready
to
lose
money
on
the
transaction
so
long
as
i
got
a
start
with
this
man
gans
expressed
doubt
of
my
ability
to
make
good
my
offer
i
proceeded
to
explain
the
special
conditions
under
which
i
ran
my
business
i
waxed
eloquent
doing
business
on
a
gigantic
scale
is
not
always
an
advantage
gans
i
sang
out
with
an
affected
yankee
twang
there
are
exceptions
and
the
industry
is
one
of
these
exceptions
especially
now
that
the
union
has
come
to
stay
by
dealing
with
a
very
big
firm
you
got
to
pay
for
union
labor
while
a
modest
fellow
like
myself
has
no
trouble
in
getting
cheap
labor
and
when
i
say
cheap
i
do
mean
poor
labor
but
just
the
opposite
i
mean
the
very
best
tailors
the
most
skilled
mechanics
in
the
country
it
sounds
queer
does
it
but
it
a
fact
nevertheless
gans
it
is
a
fact
that
the
best
ladies
tailors
are
pious
people
green
in
the
country
who
hate
to
work
in
big
places
and
who
keep
away
from
socialists
anarchists
unionists
and
their
whole
crew
they
need
very
little
and
they
love
their
work
they
willingly
stay
in
the
shop
from
early
in
the
morning
till
late
at
night
they
are
dead
stuck
on
it
hey
gans
said
quizzically
they
are
used
to
it
i
explained
in
russia
a
tailor
works
about
fourteen
hours
a
day
of
course
i
do
let
them
overwork
themselves
i
treat
them
as
if
they
were
my
brothers
or
uncles
we
get
along
like
a
family
and
they
earn
twice
as
much
as
the
strict
union
people
too
i
see
they
get
low
wages
and
do
work
too
much
and
are
ahead
of
the
game
after
all
is
that
it
well
well
but
you
a
smart
fellow
just
the
same
i
explained
to
him
why
my
men
earned
more
than
they
would
in
the
big
shops
and
the
upshot
was
an
order
for
a
hundred
suits
twenty
of
these
were
to
be
copies
of
the
garment
which
was
the
subject
of
his
challenge
i
buying
that
suit
of
him
so
as
to
use
it
as
a
sample
on
my
way
home
i
exhibited
that
suit
to
merchants
in
other
cities
giving
it
out
for
my
own
product
it
was
really
an
attractive
garment
and
it
brought
me
half
a
dozen
additional
sales
i
developed
into
an
excellent
salesman
if
i
were
asked
to
name
some
single
element
of
my
success
on
the
road
i
should
mention
the
enthusiasm
with
which
i
usually
spoke
of
my
merchandise
it
was
genuine
and
it
was
contagious
retailers
could
not
help
believing
that
i
believed
in
my
goods
chapter
iv
the
road
was
a
great
school
of
business
and
life
to
me
i
visited
scores
of
cities
i
met
hundreds
of
human
types
i
saw
much
of
the
united
states
every
time
i
returned
home
i
felt
as
though
in
comparison
with
the
places
which
i
had
just
visited
new
york
was
not
an
american
city
at
all
and
as
though
my
last
trip
had
greatly
added
to
the
real
american
quality
in
me
thousands
of
things
reminded
me
of
my
promotion
in
the
world
i
could
not
go
to
bed
in
a
pullman
car
walk
over
the
springy
runner
of
a
hotel
corridor
unfold
the
immense
napkin
of
a
hotel
or
shake
down
my
trousers
upon
alighting
from
a
chair
without
being
conscious
of
the
difference
between
my
present
life
and
my
life
in
antomir
i
was
full
of
energy
full
of
the
joy
of
being
alive
but
there
was
usually
an
undercurrent
of
sadness
to
all
this
while
on
the
road
i
would
feel
homesick
for
new
york
and
at
the
same
time
i
would
feel
that
i
had
no
home
anywhere
that
my
mother
was
dead
and
i
was
all
alone
in
the
world
i
missed
dora
many
months
after
she
made
me
move
from
her
house
as
for
max
the
thought
of
him
his
jealousy
and
the
way
he
groveled
before
me
the
last
time
i
had
seen
him
would
give
me
a
bad
taste
in
the
mouth
i
both
pitied
and
despised
him
and
i
hated
my
guilty
conscience
so
i
would
try
to
keep
him
out
of
my
mind
what
i
missed
almost
as
much
as
i
did
dora
was
her
home
there
was
no
other
to
take
its
place
there
was
not
a
single
family
in
new
york
or
in
any
other
american
town
who
would
invite
me
to
its
nest
and
make
me
feel
at
home
there
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
meyer
nodelman
but
he
never
asked
me
to
the
house
and
so
i
was
forever
homesick
not
for
antomir
for
my
native
town
had
become
a
mere
poem
but
for
a
home
i
did
some
reading
on
the
road
there
was
always
some
book
in
my
some
volume
of
spencer
emerson
or
schopenhauer
in
an
english
translation
perhaps
i
would
also
read
articles
in
the
magazines
not
to
mention
the
newspapers
but
i
would
chiefly
spend
my
time
in
the
smoker
talking
to
the
other
drummers
or
listening
to
their
talk
there
was
a
good
deal
of
in
the
cars
but
that
never
had
any
attraction
for
me
i
tried
to
learn
poker
but
found
it
tedious
the
cigarette
stumps
by
which
i
had
sought
to
counteract
my
hunger
pangs
at
the
period
of
my
dire
need
had
developed
the
cigarette
habit
in
me
this
had
subsequently
become
a
cigar
habit
i
had
discovered
the
psychological
significance
of
smoking
the
cigar
of
peace
and
good
will
i
had
realized
the
importance
of
offering
a
cigar
to
some
of
the
people
i
met
i
would
watch
american
smokers
and
study
their
ways
as
though
there
were
a
special
american
manner
of
smoking
and
such
a
thing
as
smoking
with
a
foreign
accent
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
dignity
of
smoking
a
cigar
lasted
only
while
the
cigar
was
still
long
and
fresh
there
seemed
to
be
special
elegance
in
a
smoker
taking
a
newly
lighted
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
and
throwing
a
glance
at
its
glowing
end
to
see
if
it
was
smoking
well
accordingly
i
never
did
so
without
being
conscious
of
my
gestures
and
trying
to
make
them
as
american
as
possible
the
other
cloak
salesmen
i
met
on
the
road
in
those
days
were
mostly
representatives
of
much
bigger
houses
than
mine
they
treated
me
with
contempt
and
i
would
retaliate
by
overstating
my
sales
one
of
the
drummers
who
were
fond
of
taunting
me
was
an
american
by
birth
a
fellow
named
loeb
well
levinsky
he
would
begin
had
a
big
day
did
you
i
certainly
did
i
would
retort
how
much
thousand
well
it
no
use
trying
to
be
funny
but
i
pulled
in
five
thousand
dollars
is
that
all
well
if
you
do
believe
me
what
the
use
asking
what
good
would
it
do
me
to
brag
if
i
say
five
thousand
it
is
five
thousand
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
amount
to
more
whereupon
he
would
slap
his
knee
and
roar
he
was
a
man
with
sparkling
black
eyes
a
gay
boisterous
fellow
one
of
those
who
are
the
first
to
laugh
at
their
own
jests
he
was
connected
with
the
largest
house
in
the
cloak
trade
our
relations
were
of
a
singular
character
he
was
incessantly
poking
fun
at
me
nothing
seemed
to
afford
him
more
pleasure
than
to
set
a
smokerful
of
passengers
laughing
at
my
expense
at
the
same
time
he
seemed
to
like
me
but
then
he
hated
me
too
as
for
me
i
reciprocated
both
feelings
one
day
on
the
road
he
made
me
the
victim
of
a
practical
joke
that
proved
an
expensive
lesson
to
me
the
incident
took
place
in
a
hotel
in
cincinnati
ohio
he
confidentially
let
me
see
one
of
his
samples
hinting
that
it
was
his
leader
or
best
seller
he
then
went
to
do
some
telephoning
leaving
the
garment
with
me
the
while
whereupon
i
lost
no
time
in
making
a
of
it
with
a
few
notes
as
to
materials
tints
and
other
details
i
subsequently
had
the
garment
copied
and
spent
time
and
money
offering
it
to
merchants
in
new
york
and
on
the
road
it
proved
an
unmitigated
failure
you
are
a
nice
one
you
are
he
said
to
me
with
mock
gravity
on
a
subsequent
trip
you
copied
that
garment
i
showed
you
in
cincinnati
did
you
what
garment
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
i
lied
my
face
on
fire
come
come
levinsky
you
know
very
well
what
garment
i
mean
while
i
was
away
telephoning
you
went
to
work
and
made
a
sketch
of
it
it
was
downright
robbery
that
what
i
call
it
well
have
you
sold
a
lot
of
them
and
he
gave
me
a
merry
wink
that
cut
me
as
with
a
knife
one
of
the
things
about
which
he
often
made
fun
of
me
was
my
talmud
gesticulations
a
habit
that
worried
me
like
a
physical
defect
it
was
so
distressingly
i
struggled
hard
against
it
i
had
made
efforts
to
speak
with
my
hands
in
my
pockets
i
had
devised
other
means
for
keeping
them
from
participating
in
my
speech
all
of
no
avail
i
still
gesticulate
a
great
deal
though
much
less
than
i
used
to
one
afternoon
on
a
train
loeb
entertained
a
group
of
passengers
of
which
i
was
one
with
stories
of
gesticulating
russian
jews
he
told
of
a
man
who
never
opened
his
mouth
when
he
was
out
of
doors
and
it
was
too
cold
for
him
to
expose
his
hands
of
another
man
who
never
spoke
when
it
was
so
dark
that
his
hands
could
not
be
seen
i
laughed
with
the
others
but
i
felt
like
a
cripple
who
is
forced
to
make
fun
of
his
own
deformity
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
loeb
who
was
a
jew
was
holding
up
our
whole
race
to
the
ridicule
of
gentiles
i
could
have
executed
him
as
a
traitor
to
his
people
presently
he
turned
on
me
by
the
way
levinsky
you
never
use
a
telephone
do
you
why
who
says
i
do
i
protested
timidly
because
it
of
no
use
to
you
he
replied
the
fellow
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
could
see
your
hands
could
he
and
he
broke
into
a
peal
of
mirth
in
which
some
of
his
listeners
involuntarily
joined
you
think
you
awfully
smart
i
retorted
in
abject
misery
and
you
think
you
awfully
grammatical
and
once
more
he
roared
you
are
making
fun
of
the
jewish
people
i
said
in
a
rage
are
you
a
jew
yourself
of
course
i
am
he
answered
wiping
the
tears
from
his
laughing
black
eyes
and
a
good
one
too
i
am
a
member
of
a
synagogue
but
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
i
can
speak
on
the
telephone
all
right
and
again
the
car
rang
with
his
laughter
i
was
aching
to
hurl
back
some
fitting
repartee
but
could
think
of
none
and
to
my
horror
the
moments
were
slipping
by
and
presently
the
conversation
was
changed
at
the
request
of
a
gay
little
chicagoan
who
wore
a
a
very
fat
chicagoan
told
a
story
that
was
rather
risqué
loeb
went
him
one
better
the
man
in
the
declared
that
while
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
tell
a
smutty
story
himself
he
was
as
good
as
any
man
in
appreciating
one
he
then
offered
a
box
of
cigars
for
the
most
daring
anecdote
and
there
ensued
an
orgy
of
obscenity
that
kept
us
shouting
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
similar
talks
at
the
loeb
suggested
that
the
be
dubbed
smutty
room
and
was
applauded
by
the
little
chicagoan
the
prize
was
awarded
by
a
vote
to
a
man
who
had
told
his
story
in
the
gravest
tone
of
voice
and
without
a
hint
of
a
smile
frivolity
gave
way
to
a
discussion
of
general
business
conditions
a
lanky
man
with
a
gray
beard
neatly
trimmed
and
with
the
most
refined
manners
in
our
group
said
something
about
competition
in
the
abstract
i
made
a
remark
which
seemed
to
attract
attention
and
then
i
hastened
to
refer
to
the
struggle
for
life
and
the
survival
of
the
fittest
loeb
dared
not
burlesque
me
i
was
in
high
feather
dinner
was
announced
to
keep
my
traveling
expenses
down
i
was
usually
very
frugal
on
the
road
i
had
not
yet
seen
the
inside
of
a
while
stopping
at
a
hotel
i
would
not
indulge
in
a
meal
unless
i
deemed
it
advisable
to
do
so
for
business
considerations
on
this
occasion
however
when
most
of
our
group
went
to
the
i
could
not
help
joining
them
the
lanky
man
the
little
chicagoan
and
the
fleshy
chicagoan
the
three
stars
of
the
smoker
went
to
the
same
table
and
i
hastened
with
their
ready
permission
to
occupy
the
remaining
seat
at
that
table
i
ordered
an
expensive
dinner
at
my
instance
the
chat
turned
on
national
politics
a
subject
in
which
i
felt
at
home
owing
to
my
passion
for
newspaper
editorials
i
said
something
which
met
with
an
encouraging
reception
and
then
i
entered
upon
a
somewhat
elaborate
discourse
my
listeners
seemed
to
be
interested
i
was
so
absorbed
in
the
topic
and
in
the
success
i
was
apparently
scoring
that
i
was
utterly
oblivious
to
the
taste
of
the
food
in
my
mouth
but
i
was
aware
that
it
was
aristocratic
american
food
that
i
was
in
the
company
of
american
gentiles
eating
and
conversing
with
them
a
nobleman
among
noblemen
i
throbbed
with
love
for
america
do
be
excited
i
was
saying
to
myself
speak
in
a
calm
low
voice
as
these
americans
do
and
for
goodness
sake
gesticulate
i
went
on
to
speak
with
exaggerated
apathy
my
hands
so
strenuously
still
that
they
fairly
tingled
with
the
effort
and
of
course
i
was
so
conscious
of
the
whole
performance
that
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
talking
about
this
state
of
my
mind
soon
wore
off
however
neither
the
meal
nor
the
appointments
of
the
car
contained
anything
that
i
had
not
enjoyed
scores
of
times
before
in
the
hotels
at
which
i
stopped
or
at
the
restaurants
at
which
i
would
dine
and
wine
some
of
my
customers
but
to
eat
such
a
meal
amid
such
surroundings
while
on
the
move
was
a
novel
experience
the
electric
lights
the
soft
red
glint
of
the
mahogany
walls
the
whiteness
of
the
table
linen
the
silent
efficiency
of
the
colored
waiters
coupled
with
the
fact
that
all
this
was
speeding
onward
through
the
night
made
me
feel
as
though
i
were
partaking
of
a
repast
in
an
enchanted
palace
the
easy
urbanity
of
the
three
americans
gave
me
a
sense
of
uncanny
gentility
and
bliss
can
it
be
that
i
am
i
i
seemed
to
be
wondering
the
gaunt
elderly
man
who
was
a
member
of
a
wholesale
butcher
concern
was
seated
diagonally
across
the
table
from
me
but
my
eye
was
for
the
most
part
fixed
on
him
rather
than
on
the
fat
man
who
occupied
the
seat
directly
opposite
mine
he
was
the
most
man
of
the
three
and
his
vocabulary
matched
his
appearance
and
manner
he
fascinated
me
his
cultured
english
and
ways
conflicted
in
my
mind
with
the
character
of
his
business
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
raw
beef
bones
and
congealed
blood
i
said
to
myself
it
takes
a
country
like
america
to
produce
butchers
who
look
and
speak
like
noblemen
the
united
states
was
still
full
of
surprises
for
me
i
was
still
discovering
america
after
dinner
when
we
were
in
the
again
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
three
gentiles
were
tired
of
me
had
i
talked
too
much
had
i
made
a
nuisance
of
myself
i
was
wretched
chapter
v
i
lost
track
of
loeb
before
the
train
reached
chicago
but
about
a
fortnight
later
when
i
was
in
louis
i
encountered
him
again
it
was
on
a
monday
morning
with
in
hand
i
was
crossing
one
of
the
busiest
spots
in
the
shopping
district
with
preoccupied
mien
when
he
hailed
me
hello
levinsky
how
long
have
you
been
here
just
arrived
i
answered
where
are
you
stopping
i
named
my
hotel
i
could
see
that
he
was
taking
note
of
the
fact
that
i
was
crossing
the
street
to
the
great
bazar
one
of
the
largest
department
stores
in
louis
i
am
going
to
tackle
huntington
this
morning
i
said
with
mild
defiance
are
you
wish
you
luck
he
remarked
quite
gravely
you
find
him
a
pretty
tough
customer
though
he
was
apparently
too
busy
to
indulge
in
raillery
wish
you
luck
he
repeated
and
was
off
huntington
was
the
new
head
of
the
department
in
the
great
bazar
and
in
this
capacity
he
was
said
to
be
doing
wonders
it
was
not
true
that
i
had
just
arrived
i
had
been
in
the
city
nearly
three
days
and
the
day
before
i
had
mailed
a
letter
to
huntington
upon
which
i
was
building
great
hopes
i
knew
but
too
well
that
he
was
a
tough
customer
my
previous
efforts
to
obtain
an
interview
with
him
in
new
york
as
well
as
here
in
louis
having
proven
futile
i
was
too
small
a
fish
for
him
nor
indeed
was
the
great
bazar
the
only
large
department
store
in
the
country
whose
door
was
closed
to
me
barring
six
or
seven
such
stores
in
as
many
cities
with
which
i
was
in
touch
largely
through
the
good
offices
of
eaton
my
business
was
almost
confined
to
small
concerns
eaton
had
given
me
letters
to
many
other
large
firms
but
these
had
brought
no
result
for
one
thing
my
russian
name
was
against
me
as
i
have
said
before
the
american
business
world
had
not
yet
learned
to
take
our
people
seriously
and
so
i
had
written
huntington
making
a
special
plea
for
a
few
minutes
of
his
most
valuable
time
all
i
asked
for
was
an
opportunity
to
point
out
some
specific
conditions
that
enable
our
house
to
reduce
the
cost
of
production
to
an
level
if
he
had
only
read
that
letter
i
had
bestowed
so
much
effort
on
it
and
i
gave
myself
credit
for
having
made
a
fine
job
of
it
arriving
at
the
big
store
i
made
my
way
to
the
i
did
so
by
a
the
being
denied
to
men
carrying
in
the
of
the
offices
i
found
four
or
five
men
all
of
them
accompanied
by
colored
porters
who
carried
their
for
them
a
behind
a
small
desk
was
rocking
on
the
hind
legs
of
his
chair
with
an
air
of
supreme
indifference
will
you
take
it
in
i
said
to
him
handing
him
my
card
i
want
to
see
mr
huntington
huntington
is
busy
he
answered
mechanically
without
ceasing
to
rock
take
it
in
please
i
whispered
imploringly
but
he
took
no
heed
of
me
had
i
been
the
only
salesman
in
the
room
i
should
have
offered
him
a
bribe
as
it
was
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
a
seat
and
wait
these
treat
salesmen
like
so
many
dogs
i
muttered
addressing
myself
to
the
man
by
my
side
he
sized
me
up
without
deigning
an
answer
other
salesmen
made
their
appearance
some
modestly
others
with
a
studied
air
of
confidence
loudly
greeting
those
they
knew
the
presence
of
so
many
rivals
and
the
frigidity
of
the
made
my
heart
heavy
i
was
still
a
novice
at
the
game
and
the
least
mark
of
hostility
was
apt
to
have
a
depressing
effect
on
my
spirits
though
as
a
rule
it
only
added
fuel
to
my
ambition
some
of
the
other
salesmen
were
chatting
and
cracking
jokes
for
all
the
world
like
a
group
of
devoted
friends
gathered
for
some
common
purpose
the
ostensible
meaning
of
it
all
was
that
the
competition
in
which
they
were
engaged
was
a
mere
matter
of
business
of
civilized
rivalry
that
it
was
not
supposed
to
interfere
with
their
friendship
and
mutual
sense
of
fair
play
but
i
thought
that
all
this
was
mere
pretense
and
that
at
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
each
of
them
felt
like
wiping
the
rest
of
us
off
the
face
of
the
earth
presently
the
gathered
up
our
cards
and
disappeared
behind
a
door
he
was
gone
quite
a
few
minutes
they
were
hours
to
me
i
was
in
the
toils
of
suspense
in
a
fever
of
eagerness
and
anxiety
as
i
sat
gazing
at
the
door
through
which
the
had
vanished
huntington
loomed
in
my
imagination
large
and
formidable
mighty
and
stern
to
be
admitted
to
his
presence
was
at
this
moment
the
highest
aim
of
my
life
running
through
my
anxious
mind
were
various
phrases
from
the
letter
i
had
sent
him
some
of
these
seemed
to
be
highly
felicitous
the
epistle
was
bound
to
make
an
impression
provided
he
has
read
it
i
thought
anxiously
but
why
should
he
have
bothered
with
it
he
probably
receives
scores
like
it
no
he
has
not
read
it
the
next
moment
it
became
clear
to
me
that
the
opening
sentence
of
my
plea
was
sure
to
have
arrested
huntington
attention
that
he
had
read
it
to
the
end
and
would
let
me
not
only
show
him
my
samples
but
explain
matters
as
well
of
a
sudden
however
it
struck
me
to
my
horror
that
i
had
no
recollection
of
having
signed
that
letter
of
mine
a
woman
with
a
jewish
cast
of
features
passed
through
the
i
knew
that
she
was
assistant
and
she
was
apparently
going
to
his
compartment
of
the
the
fact
that
she
had
a
jewish
face
seemed
encouraging
not
that
the
jews
i
had
met
in
business
had
shown
me
more
leniency
or
cordiality
than
the
average
gentile
nor
was
an
assistant
buyer
as
a
rule
in
a
position
to
do
something
for
a
salesman
unless
his
samples
had
been
referred
to
her
by
her
superior
nevertheless
her
jewish
features
spoke
of
kinship
to
me
they
softened
the
grimness
of
the
atmosphere
around
me
finally
the
came
back
my
heart
beat
violently
pausing
at
his
desk
with
only
two
or
three
of
all
the
cards
he
had
taken
to
the
potentate
he
looked
at
them
as
he
called
out
with
great
dignity
huntington
will
see
sallinger
stewart
and
mr
feltman
my
heart
sank
i
suspected
that
my
poor
card
had
never
reached
its
destination
that
the
boy
had
simply
thrown
it
away
together
with
some
of
the
other
cards
perhaps
on
his
way
to
room
indeed
i
knew
that
this
was
the
fate
of
many
a
card
the
boy
called
out
sallinger
name
again
this
time
admitting
him
to
the
inner
precincts
all
those
whose
cards
had
been
ignored
except
myself
there
were
about
a
dozen
of
them
picked
up
their
or
had
their
porters
do
so
and
passed
out
without
ado
as
for
me
i
simply
could
not
bring
myself
to
leave
he
did
mark
my
card
did
he
i
said
to
the
boy
no
sir
he
snapped
with
a
scowl
when
i
reached
the
street
i
paused
for
some
minutes
as
though
glued
to
the
sidewalk
was
it
all
over
was
there
no
hope
of
my
seeing
huntington
my
mind
would
not
be
reconciled
to
such
an
outcome
i
stood
racking
my
brains
for
some
subterfuge
by
which
i
might
be
able
to
break
through
the
chinese
wall
that
separated
me
from
the
great
mogul
and
when
i
finally
set
out
on
my
way
to
other
stores
i
was
still
brooding
over
the
question
i
visited
several
smaller
places
that
day
and
i
made
some
sales
but
all
the
while
i
was
displaying
my
samples
quoting
prices
arguing
cajoling
explaining
jesting
the
background
of
my
brain
never
ceased
bothering
about
huntington
and
devising
means
of
getting
at
him
the
next
morning
i
was
in
huntington
again
i
fared
no
better
than
on
the
previous
occasion
i
tried
to
speak
to
huntington
on
the
telephone
but
i
only
succeeded
in
speaking
to
a
and
she
told
me
that
he
was
busy
please
tell
huntington
i
have
a
job
to
close
out
a
garment
for
seven
fifty
huntington
is
busy
at
this
moment
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
talk
of
american
liberty
was
mere
cant
i
asked
the
manager
of
the
hotel
at
which
i
was
stopping
to
give
me
a
letter
of
introduction
to
him
and
received
a
polite
no
for
an
answer
i
discovered
the
restaurant
where
huntington
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
lunch
and
i
went
there
for
my
next
meal
for
the
purpose
of
asking
him
for
an
interview
i
knew
him
by
sight
for
i
had
seen
him
twice
in
new
york
so
when
he
walked
into
the
restaurant
there
was
a
catch
at
my
heart
he
was
a
spare
little
man
with
a
face
mustache
and
hair
that
looked
as
though
he
had
just
been
dipped
in
a
pail
of
saffron
paint
he
was
accompanied
by
another
man
i
was
determined
first
to
let
him
have
his
lunch
and
then
on
his
way
out
to
accost
him
presently
lo
and
behold
loeb
entered
the
restaurant
and
walked
straight
up
to
huntington
table
evidently
by
appointment
i
nearly
groaned
i
knew
that
loeb
had
a
spacious
at
his
hotel
with
scores
of
garments
hung
out
and
even
with
wire
figures
it
was
clear
that
huntington
had
visited
it
or
was
going
to
while
i
could
not
even
get
him
to
hear
my
prices
was
that
fair
i
saw
the
law
of
free
competition
the
great
law
of
struggle
and
the
survival
of
the
fittest
defied
violated
desecrated
i
discovered
the
residence
of
huntington
assistant
and
called
on
her
i
had
offered
presents
to
other
assistant
buyers
and
some
of
them
had
been
accepted
so
i
tried
the
same
method
in
this
case
with
an
unfortunate
result
huntington
assistant
not
only
rejected
my
bribe
but
flew
into
a
passion
to
boot
and
it
was
all
my
powers
of
pleading
could
do
to
have
her
promise
me
not
to
report
the
matter
to
her
principal
i
learned
that
huntington
was
a
member
of
the
elks
and
a
frequenter
of
their
local
but
unfortunately
i
was
not
a
member
of
that
order
i
went
to
the
quarter
of
louis
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
man
who
was
ready
to
sell
me
on
the
instalment
plan
everything
under
the
sun
from
a
house
lot
and
a
lottery
ticket
to
a
divorce
and
who
undertook
to
find
me
for
ten
dollars
somebody
who
would
give
me
a
introduction
to
huntington
but
his
eager
eloquence
failed
to
convince
me
i
had
my
coat
pressed
by
a
jewish
tailor
whose
place
was
around
the
corner
from
huntington
residence
and
who
pressed
his
suits
for
him
i
had
a
shave
in
the
barber
shop
at
which
huntington
kept
his
i
learned
something
of
the
great
man
family
life
of
his
character
ways
habits
it
proved
that
he
lived
quite
modestly
and
that
his
income
was
somewhere
between
sixty
and
seventy
dollars
a
week
mine
was
three
times
as
large
that
i
should
have
to
rack
my
brains
do
detective
work
and
be
subjected
to
all
sorts
of
humiliation
in
an
effort
to
obtain
an
audience
with
him
seemed
to
be
a
most
absurd
injustice
i
was
losing
precious
time
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
get
away
from
louis
without
having
had
the
desired
interview
huntington
name
was
buzzing
in
my
mind
like
an
insect
it
was
a
veritable
obsession
my
talk
with
his
barber
led
me
to
a
being
a
passionate
bowler
the
visited
the
place
for
an
hour
or
so
three
or
four
times
a
week
as
a
consequence
of
this
discovery
i
spent
two
afternoons
and
an
evening
there
practising
a
game
which
i
had
never
even
heard
of
before
my
labors
were
not
thrown
away
the
next
evening
i
saw
huntington
and
a
son
of
his
in
the
place
and
we
bowled
some
games
together
seen
at
close
range
the
was
a
fellow
i
thought
that
he
did
not
look
much
older
than
his
son
and
that
both
of
them
might
have
just
stepped
out
from
behind
a
necktie
counter
i
searched
the
older
countenance
for
marks
of
astuteness
initiative
or
energy
without
being
able
to
find
any
but
he
certainly
was
a
forcible
bowler
when
he
made
a
sensational
hit
and
there
broke
out
a
roar
of
admiration
i
surpassed
all
the
other
bystanders
in
exuberance
i
must
not
overdo
it
though
i
cautioned
myself
he
can
not
be
a
fool
he
see
through
me
his
son
was
apparently
very
proud
of
him
so
i
said
to
the
young
man
anybody
can
see
your
father
is
an
energetic
man
you
bet
he
is
the
young
man
returned
appreciatively
i
led
him
on
and
he
told
me
about
his
father
baseball
record
i
dropped
a
remark
about
his
being
successful
in
business
as
well
as
in
athletics
and
wound
up
by
introducing
myself
and
asking
to
be
introduced
to
his
father
it
was
a
rather
dangerous
venture
for
the
older
huntington
was
apt
to
remember
my
name
in
which
case
my
efforts
might
bring
me
nothing
but
a
rebuff
anyhow
i
took
the
plunge
and
to
my
great
delight
he
did
not
seem
ever
to
have
heard
of
me
ten
minutes
later
the
three
of
us
were
seated
over
glasses
of
lager
in
the
with
which
the
was
connected
i
told
them
that
i
was
from
new
york
and
that
i
had
come
to
louis
partly
on
business
and
partly
to
visit
a
sister
who
lived
in
their
neighborhood
the
elder
huntington
said
something
of
the
rapid
growth
of
new
york
of
its
new
high
buildings
his
english
was
curiously
interspersed
with
a
bookish
phraseology
that
seemed
to
be
traceable
to
the
advertisements
of
his
department
in
the
newspapers
i
veered
the
conversation
from
the
architectural
changes
that
had
come
over
new
york
to
changes
of
an
ethnographic
character
our
people
immigrants
from
russia
i
mean
are
beginning
to
play
a
part
in
the
business
life
of
the
city
i
said
are
you
a
russian
he
asked
i
used
to
be
i
answered
with
a
smile
i
am
an
american
now
that
right
you
see
we
are
only
the
german
jews
began
coming
a
great
many
years
ahead
of
us
but
we
ca
kick
either
i
suppose
not
he
said
genially
for
one
thing
we
are
the
early
bird
that
gets
or
is
bound
to
get
the
worm
i
mean
it
in
a
literal
sense
our
people
go
to
business
at
a
much
earlier
hour
and
go
home
much
later
there
is
quite
a
number
of
them
in
your
line
of
business
too
i
know
he
said
of
course
the
are
mostly
russian
hebrews
but
some
of
them
have
gone
into
manufacturing
and
i
do
doubt
but
they
make
a
success
of
it
why
they
are
making
a
success
of
it
mr
huntington
i
felt
that
i
was
treading
on
risky
gound
that
he
might
smell
a
rat
at
any
moment
but
i
felt
also
that
when
he
heard
why
manufacturers
of
my
type
were
able
to
undersell
the
big
old
firms
he
would
find
my
talk
too
tempting
to
cut
it
short
and
so
i
rushed
on
i
explained
that
the
russian
operated
on
a
basis
of
much
lower
profits
and
figured
down
expenses
to
a
point
never
dreamed
of
before
that
the
was
primarily
a
merchant
not
a
tailor
that
he
was
compelled
to
leave
things
to
his
designer
and
a
foreman
whereas
his
russian
competitor
was
a
tailor
or
himself
and
was
therefore
able
to
economize
in
ways
that
never
occurred
to
the
heads
of
the
old
houses
i
see
huntington
said
with
a
queer
stare
at
me
besides
our
people
content
themselves
with
small
profits
i
pursued
we
are
modest
here
i
plagiarized
an
epigram
i
had
heard
from
meyer
nodelman
our
german
will
spend
their
money
before
they
have
made
it
while
we
try
to
make
it
first
i
expected
huntington
to
smile
but
he
did
not
he
was
listening
with
gravity
when
i
paused
my
face
and
my
ears
burning
he
said
with
some
embarrassment
what
is
your
business
may
i
ask
i
am
in
the
same
line
cloaks
are
you
with
another
stare
tense
with
excitement
i
said
with
daredevil
recklessness
the
trouble
is
that
successful
men
like
yourself
are
so
hard
to
get
at
mr
huntington
what
do
you
mean
he
said
with
a
cryptic
laugh
i
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
perhaps
he
was
flattered
by
my
picture
of
him
as
an
inaccessible
magnate
perhaps
he
simply
appreciated
the
joke
of
the
thing
and
the
energy
and
tenacity
i
had
brought
to
it
but
he
let
me
narrate
the
adventure
in
detail
i
told
him
the
bare
truth
and
i
did
so
with
conscious
straining
every
nerve
to
make
a
favorable
impression
as
he
listened
he
repeatedly
broke
into
laughter
and
when
i
had
finished
he
said
to
his
son
sounds
like
a
detective
story
it
but
his
demeanor
was
still
enigmatic
and
i
anxiously
wondered
whether
i
impressed
him
as
an
energetic
business
man
or
merely
as
an
adventurer
a
crank
or
even
a
crook
all
i
ask
for
is
an
opportunity
to
show
you
my
samples
huntington
i
said
well
he
answered
deliberately
there
can
be
no
harm
in
that
and
after
a
pause
you
bagged
your
game
so
far
as
concerned
and
he
merrily
made
me
an
appointment
for
the
next
morning
about
a
month
later
i
came
across
loeb
on
broadway
new
york
by
the
way
he
said
in
the
course
of
our
brief
talk
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eve
did
you
sell
anything
to
huntington
huntington
louis
why
he
really
is
a
hard
man
to
reach
i
answered
glumly
at
that
very
moment
my
cutters
were
at
work
on
a
big
order
from
huntington
largely
for
copies
from
loeb
styles
i
had
filled
a
test
order
of
his
so
promptly
and
so
completely
to
his
satisfaction
and
my
prices
were
so
overwhelmingly
below
those
in
loeb
bill
that
the
louis
buyer
had
wired
me
a
duplicate
for
eight
hundred
suits
there
was
a
buyer
in
cleveland
a
bright
forceful
little
man
who
would
not
let
a
salesman
quote
his
price
until
he
had
made
a
guess
at
it
his
name
was
lemmelmann
he
was
an
excellent
business
man
and
a
charming
fellow
but
he
had
a
weakness
for
parading
his
ability
to
estimate
the
price
of
a
garment
down
to
a
cent
the
salesmen
naturally
humored
this
ambition
of
his
and
every
time
he
made
a
correct
guess
they
would
applaud
him
without
stint
and
i
would
follow
their
example
on
one
occasion
i
came
to
cleveland
with
two
especially
prepared
compliments
in
my
mind
every
human
being
has
five
senses
i
said
to
the
little
buyer
you
have
six
lemmelmann
you
were
born
with
a
price
sense
besides
the
ordinary
five
my
but
it
a
good
one
he
returned
jovially
yes
you
have
more
senses
than
anybody
else
lemmelmann
i
added
you
the
most
sensible
man
in
the
world
why
why
you
can
send
stuff
like
that
to
puck
or
judge
and
get
a
bill
for
it
how
much
will
you
charge
me
will
that
do
he
asked
handing
me
a
cigar
the
two
compliments
cemented
our
friendship
at
least
i
thought
they
did
another
buyer
in
atlanta
georgia
had
a
truly
wonderful
memory
he
seemed
to
remember
every
sample
he
had
ever
seen
goods
lines
trimmings
price
and
all
he
was
an
eccentric
man
sometimes
he
would
receive
a
crowd
of
salesmen
in
rapid
succession
inspect
their
merchandise
and
hear
their
prices
without
making
any
purchase
later
sometimes
on
the
same
day
he
would
send
out
orders
for
the
numbers
that
had
taken
his
fancy
while
showing
him
my
samples
one
morning
i
essayed
to
express
amazement
at
his
unusual
memory
but
in
this
case
i
mistook
my
man
if
everybody
had
your
marvelous
memory
there
would
be
little
work
for
bookkeepers
i
jested
whereupon
he
darted
an
impatient
glance
at
me
and
growled
never
mind
my
memory
you
sell
cloaks
and
suits
do
you
if
you
deal
in
taffy
you
have
to
see
the
buyer
of
the
candy
department
chapter
vi
huntington
was
a
rising
man
and
the
other
were
watchng
him
when
it
became
known
that
there
was
a
young
manufacturer
named
levinsky
with
whom
he
was
placing
heavy
orders
i
began
to
attract
general
attention
my
reputation
for
selling
stuff
for
the
lowest
prices
quoted
spread
buyers
would
call
at
my
rookery
of
a
shop
before
i
had
time
to
seek
an
interview
with
them
the
appearance
of
my
place
and
the
crudity
of
my
office
facilities
so
far
from
militating
against
my
progress
helped
to
accelerate
it
skeptical
buyers
who
had
doubted
my
ability
to
undersell
the
houses
became
convinced
of
it
when
they
inspected
my
establishment
the
place
became
far
too
small
for
me
i
moved
to
much
larger
quarters
consisting
of
the
two
uppermost
floors
and
garret
of
a
double
of
the
old
type
a
hall
bedroom
was
converted
into
an
office
the
first
separate
room
i
ever
had
for
the
purpose
and
i
enjoyed
the
possession
of
it
as
much
as
i
had
done
my
first
i
had
a
lounge
put
in
it
and
often
at
the
height
of
the
manufacturing
season
when
i
worked
from
daybreak
far
into
the
night
and
lived
on
sandwiches
i
would
instead
of
going
home
for
the
night
snatch
three
or
four
hours
sleep
on
it
the
only
thing
that
annoyed
me
was
a
faint
odor
of
mold
which
filled
my
and
which
kept
me
in
mind
of
the
margolises
old
apartment
there
was
the
pain
of
my
second
in
that
odor
for
although
i
had
not
seen
dora
nor
heard
of
her
for
more
than
two
years
i
still
thought
of
her
often
and
when
i
did
her
image
still
gave
me
pangs
of
yearning
there
was
an
air
of
prosperity
and
growth
about
my
new
place
but
this
did
not
interfere
with
the
old
air
of
skimpiness
and
cheapness
as
to
running
expenses
and
other
elements
that
go
to
make
up
the
cost
of
production
bender
salary
had
been
raised
substantially
so
much
so
that
he
had
resigned
his
place
as
teacher
devoting
himself
exclusively
to
my
shop
and
office
he
was
provokingly
childish
as
ever
but
he
had
learned
a
vast
deal
about
the
cloak
business
its
mechanical
branch
as
well
as
the
commercial
end
of
it
and
his
usefulness
had
grown
enormously
one
morning
i
was
hustling
about
my
garret
floor
vibrating
with
energy
and
when
he
came
up
the
stairs
saying
there
is
a
woman
on
the
main
floor
who
wants
to
see
you
she
says
you
know
her
was
it
dora
i
descended
the
stairs
in
a
flutter
i
was
mistaken
it
was
chaikin
she
looked
haggard
and
more
than
usually
frowsy
the
cause
of
her
pitiable
appearance
was
no
riddle
to
me
i
knew
that
her
husband
partner
had
made
a
mess
of
their
business
and
that
chaikin
had
lost
all
his
savings
does
she
want
a
loan
i
speculated
my
first
impulse
was
to
take
her
to
my
little
office
but
i
instantly
realized
that
it
would
not
be
wise
to
flaunt
such
a
mark
of
my
advancement
before
her
i
offered
her
a
chair
in
a
corner
of
the
room
in
which
i
found
her
how
is
chaikin
how
is
maxie
thank
god
maxie
is
quite
a
boy
she
answered
coyly
why
do
you
come
to
see
him
have
you
forgotten
him
he
has
not
forgotten
you
always
asking
about
levinsky
some
little
children
have
a
better
memory
than
some
grown
people
having
delivered
this
thrust
she
swept
my
shop
with
a
sepulchral
glance
followed
by
a
succession
of
nods
then
she
said
with
a
grin
at
once
wheedling
and
malicious
there
are
two
more
floors
are
there
and
i
see
you
very
busy
thank
god
plenty
of
orders
hey
thank
god
well
when
chaikin
gets
something
started
and
there
is
nobody
to
spoil
it
it
sure
to
go
well
is
it
chaikin
is
certainly
a
fine
designer
i
replied
noncommittally
wondering
what
she
was
driving
at
a
fine
designer
is
that
all
she
protested
with
exquisite
sarcasm
and
who
fixed
up
this
whole
business
styles
got
the
business
started
and
gave
it
the
name
it
has
only
fine
designer
indeed
it
a
good
thing
you
admit
that
much
at
least
well
but
what
the
use
quarreling
i
am
here
as
a
friend
not
to
make
threats
that
not
in
my
nature
she
gave
me
a
propitiating
look
and
paused
for
my
reply
what
do
you
mean
mrs
chaikin
i
asked
with
an
air
of
complaisant
perplexity
do
you
mean
she
mocked
me
suavely
poor
fellow
he
does
understand
what
a
person
means
he
has
no
head
on
his
shoulders
the
poor
thing
but
what
the
good
beating
about
the
bush
levinsky
i
am
here
to
tell
you
that
we
have
decided
to
come
back
and
be
partners
again
i
did
not
burst
into
laughter
i
just
looked
her
over
and
said
in
the
calmest
and
most
manner
that
impossible
chaikin
the
business
does
need
any
partner
does
need
any
partner
but
it
ours
this
business
as
much
as
yours
even
more
it
is
our
sweat
and
our
blood
why
you
had
a
cent
to
your
name
when
we
started
it
and
you
know
it
and
what
did
you
have
pray
did
you
know
anything
about
cloaks
could
you
do
anything
without
chaikin
we
wo
argue
about
it
mrs
chaikin
not
argue
about
it
she
was
working
herself
into
a
rage
but
she
nipped
it
in
the
bud
now
look
here
levinsky
she
said
with
fresh
suavity
i
have
told
you
i
have
come
here
to
pick
a
quarrel
maxie
misses
you
very
much
he
always
speaking
about
you
she
tried
a
tone
of
persuasion
when
chaikin
and
you
are
together
again
the
business
will
go
like
grease
you
know
it
will
he
be
the
inside
man
and
you
attend
to
the
outside
business
you
wo
have
to
worry
about
anything
around
the
shop
and
well
i
need
tell
you
what
his
designs
will
do
for
the
business
why
the
manheimers
are
just
begging
him
to
become
their
partner
this
was
a
lie
of
course
but
i
say
chaikin
better
let
us
stick
to
our
own
business
even
if
it
is
much
smaller
and
let
be
satisfied
with
whatever
god
is
pleased
to
give
us
her
protestations
and
pleadings
proving
ineffectual
she
burst
into
another
fury
and
made
an
ugly
scene
threatening
to
retain
the
biggest
lawyer
in
the
states
and
to
commence
action
against
me
i
smiled
look
at
him
he
smiling
she
said
addressing
herself
to
some
of
my
men
he
thinks
he
can
swindle
people
and
be
left
alone
better
go
home
chaikin
i
said
impatiently
i
have
no
time
all
right
we
shall
see
she
snapped
flouncing
out
before
she
closed
the
door
on
herself
she
returned
and
stalking
up
to
the
chair
which
she
had
occupied
a
minute
before
she
seated
herself
again
defiantly
chase
me
out
if
you
dare
she
said
with
a
sneer
her
chin
in
the
air
i
should
just
like
to
see
you
do
it
should
like
to
see
you
chase
me
out
of
my
own
shop
it
all
mine
all
mine
she
shouted
her
voice
mounting
hysterically
all
mine
chaikin
sweat
and
blood
you
a
swindler
a
thief
put
you
in
sing
sing
she
went
off
into
a
swoon
more
or
less
affected
and
when
i
had
brought
her
to
herself
she
shed
a
flood
of
quiet
tears
take
pity
oh
do
take
pity
she
besought
patting
my
hand
you
have
a
jewish
heart
you
take
pity
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
edge
out
of
the
room
and
to
hide
myself
a
week
later
she
came
again
this
time
with
maxie
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
nearly
three
years
and
who
seemed
to
have
grown
to
double
his
former
size
on
this
occasion
she
threatened
to
denounce
me
to
the
union
for
employing
scab
labor
finally
she
made
a
scene
that
caused
me
to
whisper
to
bender
to
telephone
for
a
policeman
before
complying
however
he
tried
persuasion
you
had
better
go
madam
he
said
to
her
meekly
you
are
excited
partly
because
he
was
a
stranger
to
her
but
mainly
i
think
because
of
his
american
appearance
and
english
she
obeyed
him
at
once
the
next
day
her
husband
came
he
looked
so
worn
and
wretched
and
he
was
so
ill
at
ease
as
he
attempted
to
explain
his
errand
that
i
could
scarcely
make
out
his
words
but
i
received
him
well
and
my
manner
was
encouraging
so
he
soon
found
his
tongue
do
you
care
to
have
it
in
the
old
way
again
he
said
piteously
why
i
wish
i
could
chaikin
i
should
be
very
glad
to
have
you
here
i
mean
what
i
say
but
it
really
impossible
i
should
try
my
best
you
know
i
know
you
would
after
a
pause
he
said
she
drive
me
into
the
grave
she
makes
my
life
so
miserable
but
it
was
she
who
made
you
get
out
of
our
partnership
i
remarked
sympathetically
yes
and
now
she
blames
it
all
on
me
when
she
heard
you
had
moved
to
a
larger
place
she
fainted
could
you
take
me
back
he
finally
went
to
work
as
a
designer
for
one
of
the
old
firms
at
a
smaller
salary
than
his
former
employers
had
paid
him
for
the
present
i
continued
to
worry
along
with
my
designer
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
chaikin
wonderful
feeling
for
line
and
color
was
unbeknown
to
himself
in
my
service
the
practice
of
pirating
designs
was
rapidly
becoming
an
open
secret
in
fact
styles
put
out
by
the
big
houses
were
copied
by
some
of
their
tailors
who
would
sell
the
drawing
for
a
few
dollars
to
some
of
the
smaller
houses
in
plenty
of
time
before
the
new
cloak
or
suit
had
been
placed
on
the
market
in
this
manner
it
was
that
i
obtained
almost
regularly
copies
of
chaikin
latest
designs
the
period
of
dire
distress
that
smote
the
country
about
this
time
the
memorable
crisis
of
dealt
me
a
staggering
blow
but
i
soon
recovered
from
it
the
crisis
had
been
preceded
by
a
series
of
bitter
conflicts
between
the
old
manufacturers
and
the
union
in
the
form
of
lockouts
strikes
and
criminal
proceedings
against
the
leaders
of
the
union
which
had
proved
fatal
to
both
the
union
was
still
in
existence
but
it
was
a
mere
shadow
of
the
formidable
body
that
it
had
been
three
years
before
and
as
work
was
scarce
labor
could
be
had
for
a
song
as
the
phrase
goes
this
enabled
me
to
make
a
number
of
comparatively
large
sales
to
tell
the
truth
the
decay
of
the
union
was
a
source
of
regret
to
me
as
the
special
talents
i
had
developed
for
dodging
it
while
it
was
powerful
had
formerly
given
me
an
advantage
over
a
majority
of
my
competitors
which
i
now
did
not
enjoy
everybody
was
now
practically
free
from
its
control
everybody
could
have
all
the
cheap
labor
he
wanted
still
i
was
one
of
a
minority
of
who
contrived
to
bring
down
the
cost
of
production
to
an
extraordinarily
low
level
and
so
i
gradually
obtained
considerable
business
rallying
from
the
shock
of
the
panic
before
it
was
well
over
chapter
vii
the
panic
was
followed
by
a
carnival
of
prosperity
of
which
i
received
a
generous
share
my
business
was
progressing
with
leaps
and
bounds
the
factory
and
office
were
moved
to
broadway
this
time
it
was
a
real
office
with
several
bookkeepers
stenographers
model
girls
and
golden
legends
on
the
doors
these
legends
were
always
glittering
in
my
mind
people
were
loading
me
with
flattery
everybody
was
telling
me
that
i
had
got
there
and
some
were
hinting
or
saying
in
so
many
words
that
i
was
a
man
of
rare
gifts
of
exceptional
character
i
accepted
it
all
as
my
due
nay
i
regarded
myself
as
rather
underestimated
they
do
really
understand
me
i
would
think
to
myself
they
know
that
i
possess
brains
and
grit
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
they
are
too
commonplace
to
appreciate
the
subtlety
of
my
thoughts
and
feelings
every
successful
man
is
a
napoleon
in
one
thing
at
least
in
believing
himself
the
ward
of
a
lucky
star
i
was
no
exception
to
this
rule
i
came
to
think
myself
infallible
in
short
prosperity
had
turned
my
head
i
looked
upon
poor
people
with
more
contempt
than
ever
i
still
called
them
misfits
in
a
darwinian
sense
the
removal
of
my
business
to
broadway
was
an
official
confirmation
of
my
being
one
of
the
fittest
and
those
golden
inscriptions
on
my
two
office
doors
seemed
to
proclaim
it
solemnly
at
the
same
time
i
did
not
seem
to
be
successful
enough
i
felt
as
though
my
rewards
were
inadequate
i
was
now
worth
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
the
sum
did
not
seem
to
be
anything
to
rejoice
over
my
fortune
was
not
climbing
rapidly
enough
i
was
almost
tempted
to
stamp
my
foot
and
snarlingly
urge
it
on
only
one
hundred
thousand
why
there
were
so
many
illiterate
dunces
who
had
not
even
heard
of
darwin
and
spencer
and
who
were
worth
more
there
were
moments
however
when
my
success
would
seem
something
incredible
that
was
usually
when
i
chanced
to
think
of
some
scene
of
my
past
life
with
special
vividness
could
it
be
possible
that
i
was
worth
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
i
wore
shoes
ate
dollar
lunches
and
had
an
army
of
employees
at
my
beck
and
call
i
never
recalled
my
unrealized
dreams
of
a
college
education
without
experiencing
a
qualm
of
regret
one
day
it
was
a
drizzly
afternoon
in
april
as
i
walked
along
broadway
under
my
umbrella
i
came
across
jake
mindels
the
handsome
young
man
who
had
been
my
companion
during
the
period
when
i
was
preparing
for
city
college
i
had
not
seen
him
for
over
two
years
but
i
had
kept
track
of
his
career
and
i
knew
that
he
had
recently
graduated
from
the
university
medical
college
and
had
opened
a
doctor
office
on
rivington
street
his
studiously
dignified
carriage
his
prince
albert
coat
the
way
he
wore
his
soft
hat
the
way
he
held
his
open
umbrella
and
above
all
the
beard
he
was
growing
betrayed
a
desire
to
look
his
new
part
and
he
did
look
it
too
the
nascent
beard
the
and
the
soft
hat
became
him
he
was
handsomer
than
ever
and
there
was
a
new
air
of
quiet
though
conscious
intellectual
importance
about
him
the
sight
of
him
as
i
beheld
him
coming
toward
me
gave
me
a
pang
of
envy
levinsky
how
are
you
how
are
you
he
shouted
flinging
himself
at
me
effusively
i
hear
you
practising
medicine
i
returned
and
looking
him
over
gaily
i
added
a
doctor
every
inch
of
you
he
blushed
and
you
a
rich
man
i
hear
vanderbilt
is
richer
i
can
assure
you
i
should
change
places
with
you
any
time
in
my
heart
i
remarked
yes
i
am
worth
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
while
he
is
probably
struggling
to
make
a
living
but
i
can
beat
him
at
his
own
intellectual
game
too
even
if
he
has
studied
anatomy
and
physiology
well
you
will
be
a
vanderbilt
some
day
you
only
beginning
to
make
money
people
say
you
are
a
great
success
i
was
so
glad
to
hear
of
it
and
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
were
glad
i
jested
gratefully
and
how
are
things
with
you
all
right
he
answered
firmly
i
ca
complain
for
the
time
been
practising
i
am
doing
very
well
very
well
indeed
he
told
me
of
a
case
in
which
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
successful
physicians
on
the
east
side
had
made
a
false
diagnosis
and
where
he
mindels
had
made
the
correct
one
and
saved
the
patient
life
the
family
would
hear
of
another
doctor
now
they
would
give
their
lives
for
me
he
said
with
a
simper
i
took
him
up
to
my
factory
and
showed
him
about
he
was
lavish
in
his
expressions
of
surprise
at
the
magnitude
of
my
concern
and
when
i
asked
him
to
have
dinner
with
me
that
evening
he
seemed
to
be
more
than
pleased
apart
from
other
feelings
he
was
probably
glad
to
renew
acquaintance
with
a
man
who
could
afford
to
pay
a
decent
doctor
bill
and
through
whom
he
might
get
in
touch
with
other
desirable
patrons
presently
he
wrinkled
his
forehead
as
though
he
had
suddenly
remembered
something
oh
let
me
see
he
said
could
we
postpone
it
i
have
a
confinement
this
evening
i
expect
to
be
called
at
any
moment
we
changed
the
date
and
he
departed
i
was
left
somewhat
excited
by
the
reminiscences
that
the
meeting
had
evoked
in
me
i
fell
to
pacing
the
floor
of
my
office
ruminating
upon
the
change
which
the
past
few
years
had
wrought
in
his
life
and
in
mine
his
boastful
garrulity
was
something
new
in
him
was
it
the
struggle
for
existence
which
was
forcing
it
upon
him
i
wondered
whether
that
confinement
story
was
not
a
fib
invented
to
flaunt
his
professional
success
thereupon
i
gave
myself
credit
for
my
knowledge
of
human
nature
that
one
of
the
secrets
of
my
success
i
thought
i
complimented
myself
upon
the
possession
of
all
sorts
of
talents
but
my
keenest
ambition
was
to
be
recognized
as
an
unerring
judge
of
men
the
amusing
part
of
it
was
that
in
for
example
i
found
that
in
my
judgment
of
men
and
things
had
been
immature
and
puerile
i
was
convinced
that
now
at
last
my
insight
was
a
thoroughly
reliable
instrurnent
only
a
year
later
to
look
back
upon
my
opinions
of
with
contempt
i
was
everlastingly
revising
my
views
of
people
including
my
own
self
book
xi
matrimony
chapter
i
one
afternoon
in
january
or
february
i
was
on
a
lexington
avenue
car
going
at
street
the
car
was
invaded
by
a
vivacious
crowd
of
young
girls
each
with
a
stack
of
books
under
one
of
her
arms
it
was
evident
that
they
were
returning
home
from
normal
college
which
was
on
that
corner
some
of
them
preferred
to
stand
holding
on
to
straps
so
as
to
face
and
converse
with
their
seated
chums
i
was
watching
them
as
they
chattered
laughed
or
whispered
bubbling
over
with
the
joy
of
being
young
and
with
the
consciousness
of
their
budding
womanhood
when
my
attention
was
attracted
to
one
of
their
number
a
tall
lanky
lass
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
she
was
hanging
on
to
a
strap
directly
across
the
car
from
me
i
could
not
see
her
face
but
the
shape
of
her
head
and
a
certain
jerk
of
it
when
she
laughed
looked
strikingly
familiar
to
me
presently
she
chanced
to
turn
around
and
i
recognized
her
it
was
lucy
i
had
not
seen
her
for
six
years
she
was
completely
changed
and
yet
the
same
not
yet
fully
formed
elongated
attenuated
angular
ridiculously
too
tall
for
her
looks
and
not
quite
so
pretty
as
she
had
been
at
nine
or
ten
but
overflowing
with
color
with
light
with
blossoming
life
she
thrilled
me
almost
to
tears
i
was
aching
to
call
out
her
name
to
hear
myself
say
lucy
as
i
had
once
been
wont
to
do
but
i
was
not
sure
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
let
her
father
hear
of
my
lingering
interest
in
his
family
while
i
was
thus
debating
with
myself
whether
i
should
accost
her
her
glance
fell
on
me
she
transferred
it
to
one
of
the
windows
and
the
next
moment
she
fell
to
eying
me
furtively
she
has
recognized
me
but
she
wo
come
over
to
me
i
thought
she
seems
to
be
aware
of
her
father
jealousy
it
was
a
painful
moment
presently
her
fresh
youthful
face
brightened
up
she
bent
over
to
two
of
her
girl
friends
and
whispered
something
to
them
and
then
these
threw
glances
at
me
after
some
more
whispering
lucy
faced
about
boldly
and
stepped
over
to
me
i
beg
your
pardon
are
you
mr
levinsky
she
asked
with
sweet
girlish
shyness
of
course
i
am
lucy
lucy
dear
how
are
you
quite
a
young
lady
i
was
wondering
she
went
on
without
answering
at
first
i
did
not
know
you
did
seem
familiar
to
me
but
i
could
not
locate
your
face
but
then
all
at
once
do
you
know
i
said
to
myself
it
mr
levinsky
oh
i
so
glad
to
see
you
she
was
all
flushed
and
beaming
with
the
surprise
of
the
meeting
with
consciousness
of
the
eyes
of
her
classmates
who
were
watching
her
and
with
something
else
which
seemed
to
say
i
am
lucy
but
not
the
little
girl
you
used
to
play
with
i
am
a
young
woman
and
i
was
wondering
who
that
tall
charming
young
lady
was
i
said
lord
how
you
have
grown
lucy
yes
i
already
taller
than
mother
and
father
she
answered
than
both
together
no
not
as
bad
as
all
that
she
giggled
for
children
of
our
immigrants
to
outgrow
their
parents
not
only
intellectually
but
physically
as
well
is
a
common
phenomenon
perhaps
it
is
due
to
their
being
fed
far
better
than
their
parents
were
in
their
childhood
and
youth
i
asked
lucy
to
take
a
seat
by
my
side
and
she
did
cheerfully
maybe
she
does
not
know
anything
i
wondered
how
is
danny
i
asked
still
fat
no
not
very
she
laughed
he
goes
to
school
i
have
a
little
sister
too
she
added
blushing
the
least
bit
i
winced
it
was
as
though
i
had
heard
something
revoltingly
unseemly
then
a
thought
crossed
my
mind
and
seized
with
an
odd
feeling
of
curiosity
i
asked
how
old
is
she
oh
a
little
less
than
a
year
lucy
replied
she
awful
cute
she
laughed
and
how
is
papa
i
inquired
to
turn
the
conversation
he
all
right
thank
you
she
answered
gravely
only
he
lost
a
lot
of
money
on
account
of
the
hard
times
many
of
his
customers
were
out
of
work
business
is
picking
up
though
and
how
is
becky
are
you
still
great
friends
why
she
ought
to
be
here
she
replied
gazing
around
the
car
must
be
in
the
next
car
in
another
car
i
exclaimed
in
mock
amazement
not
by
your
side
lucy
laughed
we
are
in
the
same
class
she
said
and
of
course
the
families
still
live
in
the
same
house
she
nodded
affirmatively
adding
that
they
lived
at
one
hundred
and
second
street
near
madison
avenue
about
a
block
and
a
half
from
the
park
come
up
some
time
wo
you
she
gurgled
with
childish
amiability
yet
with
apparent
awkwardness
i
wondered
whether
she
was
aware
of
her
father
jealousy
if
she
were
she
certainly
would
not
invite
me
to
the
house
i
reflected
i
made
no
answer
to
her
invitation
wo
you
come
up
she
insisted
i
thought
she
does
seem
to
know
anything
about
it
she
has
only
heard
that
i
had
a
quarrel
with
her
mother
i
shook
my
head
smiling
affectionately
why
are
you
still
angry
at
mother
she
pursued
shaking
her
head
deprecatingly
as
who
should
say
you
a
bad
boy
i
thought
of
course
she
does
know
i
smiled
again
then
i
said
you
a
sweet
girl
all
the
same
and
a
big
one
too
thank
you
do
come
will
you
i
shook
my
head
will
you
never
come
she
asked
playfully
never
never
i
have
told
you
you
a
charming
girl
have
i
what
more
do
you
want
the
american
children
of
the
ghetto
are
american
not
only
in
their
language
tastes
and
ambitions
but
in
outward
appearance
as
well
their
bearing
gestures
the
play
of
their
features
and
something
in
the
very
expression
of
their
semitic
faces
proclaim
the
land
of
their
birth
all
this
was
true
of
lucy
she
was
fascinatingly
american
and
i
told
her
so
you
not
simply
a
charming
girl
you
a
charming
american
girl
i
said
i
wondered
whether
dora
had
been
keeping
up
her
studies
and
by
questioning
lucy
about
the
books
under
her
arm
i
contrived
to
elicit
the
information
that
her
mother
had
read
not
only
such
works
as
the
vicar
of
wakefield
washington
irving
sketch
book
and
lamb
shakespeare
stories
which
had
been
part
of
lucy
course
during
her
first
year
at
college
but
that
she
had
also
read
some
of
the
works
of
cooper
george
eliot
dickens
thackeray
hawthorne
and
all
sorts
of
cheaper
novels
mother
is
a
great
reader
lucy
said
she
reads
more
than
i
do
why
she
reads
newspapers
and
magazines
everything
she
can
lay
her
hands
on
father
calls
her
professor
she
also
told
me
that
her
mother
had
read
a
good
deal
of
poetry
that
she
knew
the
ancient
mariner
and
the
raven
by
heart
she
always
at
me
because
i
do
care
for
poetry
as
much
as
she
does
she
laughed
well
you
not
taller
than
your
mother
in
this
respect
are
you
she
assented
with
an
appreciative
giggle
she
left
the
car
on
the
corner
of
one
hundred
and
second
street
i
was
in
a
queer
state
of
excitement
it
flashed
upon
my
mind
that
the
section
of
central
park
in
the
vicinity
of
one
hundred
and
second
street
teemed
with
women
and
and
that
it
was
but
natural
to
suppose
that
dora
would
be
out
every
day
wheeling
her
baby
in
that
locality
and
reading
a
book
perhaps
i
visioned
myself
meeting
her
there
some
afternoon
and
telling
her
of
my
undying
love
i
even
worked
out
the
details
of
the
plan
but
i
felt
that
i
should
never
carry
it
out
i
still
loved
dora
but
that
was
the
dora
of
six
years
before
an
image
of
an
enshrined
past
she
was
a
dear
sad
memory
scarcely
anything
more
and
it
seemed
as
though
to
disturb
that
sadness
were
sacrilege
i
shall
probably
run
up
against
her
some
day
i
said
to
myself
dolefully
and
an
echo
seemed
to
add
you
are
all
alone
in
the
world
chapter
ii
i
was
a
lonely
man
i
was
pulsating
with
activity
and
with
a
sense
of
triumph
i
was
receiving
multitudes
of
new
impressions
and
enjoying
life
in
a
multitude
of
ways
with
no
dearth
of
woman
and
song
in
the
program
but
at
the
bottom
of
my
consciousness
i
was
always
lonely
there
were
moments
when
my
desolation
would
assert
itself
rather
violently
this
happened
nearly
every
time
i
returned
to
new
york
from
the
road
as
the
train
entered
the
great
city
my
sense
of
would
emphasize
a
feeling
that
the
furnished
apartment
on
lexington
avenue
which
was
waiting
to
receive
me
was
not
a
home
meyer
nodelman
whom
i
often
met
in
a
broadway
restaurant
at
the
lunch
hour
these
days
would
chaff
or
lecture
me
earnestly
upon
my
unmarried
state
you
do
know
who
you
working
for
he
would
say
his
sad
oriental
face
taking
on
an
affectionate
expression
life
is
short
at
best
but
when
a
fellow
has
nobody
to
bear
his
name
after
he
is
gone
it
is
shorter
still
get
married
my
boy
get
married
he
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
growth
of
my
business
he
rejoiced
in
it
as
though
he
ascribed
my
successes
to
the
loans
he
had
given
me
when
i
struggled
for
a
foothold
he
often
alluded
to
those
favors
but
he
was
a
devoted
friend
all
the
same
moreover
he
was
a
most
attractive
man
to
talk
to
especially
when
the
conversation
dealt
with
one
intimate
life
with
all
his
illiteracy
and
crudity
of
language
he
had
rare
insight
into
the
human
heart
and
was
full
of
subtle
sympathy
he
was
the
only
person
in
america
with
whom
i
often
indulged
in
a
confab
he
was
keenly
aware
of
my
loneliness
it
seemed
as
though
it
disturbed
him
you
are
not
a
happy
man
levinsky
he
once
said
to
me
you
feel
more
alone
than
any
bachelor
i
ever
knew
you
an
orphan
poor
thing
you
have
a
fine
business
and
plenty
of
money
and
all
sorts
of
nice
times
but
you
are
an
orphan
just
the
same
still
a
child
you
need
a
mother
well
but
what
the
use
your
own
mother
peace
upon
her
can
not
be
brought
to
life
until
the
coming
of
the
messiah
so
do
the
next
best
thing
levinsky
get
married
and
you
will
have
a
mother
for
your
children
it
is
the
same
kind
but
you
wo
feel
lonesome
any
longer
i
laughed
laugh
away
levinsky
but
you
ca
help
it
and
the
smart
books
you
read
wo
help
you
either
you
got
to
get
married
whether
you
want
it
or
not
this
is
a
bill
that
must
be
paid
i
had
lunch
with
him
a
day
or
two
after
my
meeting
with
lucy
the
sight
of
his
affectionate
melancholy
face
and
the
warmth
of
his
greeting
somehow
made
me
think
of
the
sentimental
mood
in
which
i
had
been
left
by
that
encounter
i
do
feel
lonesome
i
said
with
a
smile
in
the
course
of
our
chat
i
met
a
girl
the
other
day
did
you
he
said
expectantly
oh
she
is
a
mere
child
not
the
kind
of
girl
you
mean
nodelman
i
once
boarded
in
her
mother
house
she
was
a
mere
child
then
she
is
still
a
child
but
she
goes
to
college
now
and
she
is
taller
than
her
mother
when
i
saw
her
i
felt
old
is
that
anything
to
be
sad
about
pshaw
get
married
and
have
a
daughter
of
your
own
and
when
she
grows
up
you
wo
be
sorry
take
it
from
me
levinsky
there
can
be
no
greater
pleasure
than
to
watch
your
kids
grow
and
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
i
do
advise
you
to
get
married
perhaps
i
ought
to
i
said
listlessly
but
then
it
takes
two
to
make
a
bargain
oh
there
are
lots
of
good
girls
and
you
can
have
the
best
piece
of
goods
there
is
oh
i
do
know
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
good
girl
perhaps
the
question
is
whether
she
be
good
after
the
honeymoon
is
over
you
do
want
a
bond
and
mortgage
to
guarantee
that
you
be
happy
do
you
a
fellow
must
be
ready
to
take
a
chance
there
is
an
old
story
of
a
rabbi
who
upon
being
asked
by
a
bachelor
whether
he
should
marry
said
if
you
do
you
will
regret
it
my
son
but
then
if
you
remain
single
you
are
sure
to
regret
it
just
as
much
perhaps
more
so
get
married
like
everybody
else
and
regret
it
like
everybody
else
nodelman
now
quoted
that
rabbi
i
had
heard
the
anecdote
more
than
once
before
but
it
seemed
as
though
its
meaning
had
now
revealed
itself
to
me
for
the
first
time
according
to
that
rabbi
marriage
is
not
a
pleasure
but
a
miserable
necessity
i
urged
well
it
is
all
misery
either
people
are
fond
of
saying
that
the
best
marriage
is
a
curse
but
it
the
other
way
around
the
worst
marriage
has
some
blessing
in
it
levinsky
oh
i
do
know
get
married
and
you
will
there
is
plenty
of
pleasure
in
the
worst
of
homes
take
it
from
me
levinsky
when
i
come
home
and
feel
that
i
have
somebody
to
live
for
that
it
is
not
the
devil
i
am
working
for
then
take
it
from
me
levinsky
i
should
not
give
one
moment
like
that
for
all
the
other
pleasures
in
the
world
put
together
i
thought
of
his
wife
whom
his
mother
had
repeatedly
described
to
me
as
a
face
and
a
virago
and
of
his
home
which
i
had
always
pictured
as
hell
his
words
touched
me
it
is
that
i
do
want
to
take
chances
nodelman
something
else
were
you
ever
in
love
mr
nodelman
what
was
i
in
love
why
he
demanded
coloring
what
put
it
in
your
head
to
ask
me
such
a
funny
question
funny
there
more
pain
than
fun
in
it
well
i
have
loved
nodelman
and
that
why
it
so
hard
for
me
to
think
of
marriage
as
a
cold
proposition
i
do
think
i
could
marry
a
girl
i
did
not
love
i
expected
an
argument
against
but
nodelman
had
none
to
offer
instead
he
had
me
dilate
on
the
bliss
and
the
agony
of
loving
he
asked
me
questions
and
eagerly
listened
to
my
answers
i
told
him
of
my
own
two
particularly
of
my
relations
with
dora
i
omitted
names
and
other
details
that
might
have
pointed
ever
so
remotely
to
margolis
identity
nodelman
was
interested
intensely
his
interrogations
were
of
the
kind
that
a
girl
of
sixteen
who
had
not
yet
loved
might
address
to
a
bosom
friend
who
had
how
does
it
feel
to
be
in
doubt
whether
one
passion
had
found
an
echo
how
did
i
feel
when
our
lips
were
joined
in
our
first
kiss
how
did
she
carry
herself
the
next
time
i
saw
her
was
she
shy
did
she
look
happy
was
she
afraid
of
her
husband
was
i
afraid
the
restaurant
had
been
nearly
deserted
for
about
an
hour
and
we
still
sat
smoking
cigars
and
whispering
chapter
iii
one
day
as
nodelman
took
his
seat
across
the
table
from
me
at
the
restaurant
he
said
well
levinsky
it
no
use
you
have
to
get
married
now
there
will
be
no
wriggling
out
of
it
my
wife
has
set
her
mind
on
it
your
wife
i
asked
in
surprise
yes
i
have
an
order
to
bring
you
up
to
the
house
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
do
blame
her
though
the
fault
is
mine
i
have
told
her
so
much
about
you
she
wants
to
know
you
to
know
me
and
to
marry
me
off
hey
and
yet
you
claim
to
be
a
friend
of
mine
well
it
no
use
talking
you
have
to
come
i
received
a
formal
invitation
written
in
english
by
nodelman
and
on
a
friday
night
in
may
i
was
in
my
house
for
supper
as
nodelman
called
it
or
dinner
as
his
wife
would
have
it
the
family
occupied
one
of
a
small
group
of
lingering
brownstone
private
dwellings
in
a
neighborhood
swarming
with
the
inmates
of
new
tenement
barracks
glad
to
meechye
nodelman
welcomed
me
meyer
should
have
broughchye
up
long
ago
why
did
you
keep
levinsky
away
meyer
was
you
afraid
you
might
have
reason
to
be
jealous
that
just
it
she
hit
it
right
i
told
you
she
was
a
smart
girl
i
levinsky
do
be
uneasy
meyer
levinsky
wo
even
look
at
an
old
woman
like
me
it
a
pretty
girl
he
fishin
for
ainchye
mr
levinsky
she
was
with
small
features
inconspicuously
traced
in
a
bulging
mass
of
flesh
this
was
why
her
called
her
face
she
had
a
hoarse
voice
and
altogether
she
might
have
given
me
the
impression
of
being
drunk
had
there
not
been
something
pleasing
in
her
hoarseness
as
well
as
in
that
droll
face
of
hers
that
she
was
was
clear
from
the
way
she
spoke
her
unpolished
english
was
nodelman
the
henpecked
husband
that
his
mother
advertised
him
to
be
i
wondered
whether
the
frequency
with
which
his
wife
used
his
first
name
could
be
accepted
as
evidence
to
the
contrary
they
had
six
children
a
youth
of
nineteen
named
maurice
who
was
the
image
of
his
father
and
having
spent
two
years
at
college
was
with
him
in
the
clothing
business
a
boy
who
had
his
mother
face
and
whose
name
was
sidney
an
appellation
very
popular
among
our
people
as
swell
american
and
four
smaller
children
the
youngest
being
a
little
girl
of
six
what
do
you
think
of
my
stock
levinsky
nodelman
asked
quite
a
lot
is
it
may
no
evil
eye
strike
them
what
do
you
think
of
the
baby
come
here
beatrice
recite
something
for
uncle
the
command
had
barely
left
his
mouth
when
beatrice
sprang
to
her
feet
and
burst
out
mumbling
something
in
a
kindergarten
singsong
this
lasted
some
minutes
then
she
courtesied
shook
her
skirts
and
slipped
back
into
her
seat
she
is
only
six
and
she
is
already
more
educated
than
her
father
nodelman
said
and
sidney
he
studyin
french
at
high
school
sidney
talk
some
french
to
levinsky
he
understand
you
come
on
show
levinsky
you
ai
going
to
be
as
ignorant
as
your
the
scene
was
largely
a
stereotyped
copy
of
the
one
i
had
witnessed
upon
my
first
call
at
the
sidney
scowled
come
on
sidney
be
a
good
boy
nodelman
urged
taking
him
by
the
sleeve
let
me
alone
sidney
snarled
breaking
away
and
striking
the
air
a
fierce
backward
blow
with
his
elbow
what
do
you
want
of
him
nodelman
said
to
her
husband
frigidly
my
friend
desisted
sheepishly
he
does
seem
to
be
afraid
of
his
american
household
i
said
to
myself
after
the
meal
when
we
were
all
in
the
parlor
again
nodelman
said
to
his
wife
winking
at
me
poor
fellow
his
patience
has
all
given
out
he
wants
to
know
about
the
girl
you
got
for
him
he
has
no
strength
any
longer
ca
you
see
it
bella
look
at
him
look
at
him
another
minute
and
he
faint
what
girl
oh
i
see
why
there
is
more
than
one
nodelman
returned
confusedly
i
did
mean
anybody
in
particular
there
are
plenty
of
young
ladies
that
the
trouble
there
are
plenty
and
no
one
in
particular
i
said
do
cry
nodelman
said
just
be
a
good
boy
and
nodelman
will
get
you
a
peach
of
a
young
lady
wo
you
bella
i
guess
so
she
answered
with
a
smile
do
you
understand
he
proceeded
to
explain
she
first
wants
to
know
the
kind
of
customer
you
are
then
she
know
what
kind
of
merchandise
to
look
for
is
that
it
bella
she
made
no
answer
i
hope
nodelman
will
find
me
a
pretty
decent
sort
of
customer
i
put
in
you
all
right
she
said
demurely
i
afraid
it
wo
be
an
easy
job
to
get
a
young
lady
to
suit
a
customer
like
you
try
your
best
will
you
i
said
i
certainly
will
she
was
less
talkative
now
and
certainly
less
at
her
ease
than
she
had
been
before
the
topic
was
broached
which
impressed
me
rather
favorably
altogether
she
was
far
from
the
virago
or
witch
her
had
described
her
to
be
as
to
her
attitude
toward
her
husband
i
subsequently
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
blend
of
affection
and
contempt
nodelman
was
henpecked
but
not
badly
so
i
called
on
them
three
or
four
times
more
during
that
spring
somehow
the
question
of
my
marriage
was
never
mentioned
on
these
occasions
and
then
nodelman
and
the
children
all
except
maurice
went
to
the
seashore
for
the
summer
chapter
iv
you
examine
the
merchandise
and
if
you
do
like
it
nobody
is
going
to
make
you
buy
it
said
nodelman
to
me
one
day
in
january
of
the
following
winter
by
merchandise
he
meant
a
miss
kalmanovitch
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
to
whom
i
was
to
be
introduced
at
the
nodelman
residence
four
days
later
she
is
a
peach
of
a
girl
beautiful
as
the
sun
and
no
runt
either
a
lovely
girl
good
looks
are
everything
beauty
is
skin
deep
and
handsome
is
as
handsome
does
i
paraded
my
english
oh
she
is
a
good
girl
every
way
a
fine
housekeeper
and
educated
gee
how
educated
she
is
why
she
has
a
pile
of
books
in
her
room
bella
says
a
pile
that
high
he
raised
his
hand
above
his
head
she
is
dead
stuck
on
her
bella
is
owing
to
an
illness
in
the
kalmanovitch
family
the
projected
meeting
could
not
take
place
but
nodelman
birthday
was
to
be
celebrated
in
march
so
the
gathering
was
to
serve
as
a
agency
as
well
as
a
social
function
the
great
event
came
to
pass
on
a
sunday
evening
the
prospect
of
facing
a
girl
who
offered
herself
as
a
candidate
for
becoming
my
wife
put
me
all
in
a
flutter
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
dress
and
i
made
my
appearance
at
the
nodelmans
rather
late
in
the
evening
nodelman
who
met
me
in
the
hall
offered
me
a
tempestuous
welcome
here
he
is
better
late
than
never
she
shrieked
hoarsely
as
i
entered
the
hall
at
the
head
of
the
high
stoop
i
was
uneasy
honest
i
was
and
dropping
her
voice
miss
kalmanovitch
came
on
time
she
a
good
girl
always
and
she
gave
me
a
knowing
look
that
brought
the
color
to
my
face
and
a
coy
smile
into
hers
her
husband
appeared
a
minute
later
after
greeting
me
warmly
he
whispered
into
my
ear
nobody
knows
anything
about
it
not
even
the
young
lady
only
her
mother
does
but
i
soon
discovered
that
he
was
mistaken
my
appearance
produced
a
sensation
and
the
telltale
glances
of
the
women
from
me
to
a
large
girl
with
black
eyes
who
stood
at
the
mantelpiece
not
only
showed
plainly
that
they
knew
all
about
it
but
also
indicated
who
of
the
young
women
present
was
miss
kalmanovitch
the
spacious
parlor
was
literally
jammed
the
hostess
led
the
way
through
the
throng
introducing
me
to
the
guests
as
we
proceeded
there
were
nodelman
father
and
mother
among
them
the
gigantic
old
tailor
grinning
childishly
by
the
side
of
his
wife
who
looked
glum
that
one
with
the
dark
eves
by
the
mantelpiece
meyer
nodelman
whispered
to
me
eagerly
the
girl
pointed
out
was
large
and
plump
with
full
cheeks
and
a
dimple
in
her
fleshy
chin
her
black
eyes
were
large
and
round
that
the
object
of
my
coming
and
of
her
own
was
no
secret
to
her
was
quite
evident
she
was
blushing
to
the
roots
of
her
glossy
black
hair
and
in
her
apparent
struggle
with
her
constraint
she
put
her
stout
long
arm
around
the
waist
of
a
girl
who
stood
by
her
side
against
the
mantelpiece
upon
the
whole
miss
kalmanovitch
impressed
me
more
than
favorably
but
a
minute
later
when
i
was
introduced
to
her
and
saw
her
double
chin
and
shook
her
gently
by
a
hand
that
was
fat
and
damp
with
perspiration
i
all
but
shuddered
i
felt
as
though
she
exuded
oil
i
was
introduced
to
her
mother
a
spare
little
woman
with
bad
teeth
who
looked
me
over
in
a
most
way
and
to
her
father
a
gray
man
with
a
goatee
miss
kalmanovitch
and
i
soon
found
ourselves
seated
side
by
side
conscious
of
being
the
target
of
many
eyes
i
was
as
disconcerted
as
i
had
been
twelve
years
before
when
matilda
played
her
first
practical
joke
upon
my
sidelocks
my
fiancée
was
the
first
to
recover
her
ease
she
asked
me
if
i
was
related
to
a
man
named
levinsky
and
when
i
said
no
she
passed
to
other
topics
she
led
the
conversation
and
i
scarcely
followed
her
at
one
moment
for
example
as
i
looked
her
in
the
face
endeavoring
to
listen
to
what
she
was
saying
about
the
purim
ball
she
had
attended
i
remarked
to
myself
that
the
name
kalmanovitch
somehow
seemed
to
go
well
with
her
face
and
figure
and
that
she
was
too
for
a
bridal
candidate
presently
we
heard
nodelman
hoarse
voice
now
miss
kalmanovitch
will
oblige
us
with
some
music
wo
you
please
miss
kalmanovitch
a
swarthy
woman
with
features
that
somewhat
resembled
those
of
the
host
whose
cousin
she
was
and
with
huge
golden
teeth
that
glistened
took
miss
kalmanovitch
by
the
arm
saying
in
a
mannish
voice
come
on
ray
show
them
what
you
can
do
my
companion
rose
and
throwing
gay
glances
at
some
of
the
other
girls
she
walked
over
to
the
piano
and
seated
herself
then
with
some
more
smiles
at
the
girls
she
attacked
the
keyboard
a
nauctourrn
by
chopin
her
mother
explained
to
me
in
an
audible
whisper
across
the
room
miss
kalmanovitch
was
banging
away
with
an
effect
of
showing
how
quickly
she
could
get
through
the
nocturne
i
am
not
musical
in
the
accepted
meaning
of
the
term
and
in
those
days
i
was
even
less
so
than
i
am
now
perhaps
but
i
was
always
fond
of
music
and
had
a
discriminating
feeling
for
it
at
all
events
i
knew
enough
to
realize
that
my
fiancée
was
playing
execrably
but
her
mother
her
father
the
hostess
and
the
swarthy
woman
with
the
golden
teeth
were
shooting
glances
at
me
that
seemed
to
say
what
do
you
think
of
that
did
you
ever
see
such
fast
playing
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
simulate
admiration
the
woman
with
the
great
golden
teeth
meyer
nodelman
cousin
was
even
more
strenuous
in
her
efforts
to
arouse
my
exultation
than
ray
mother
she
was
the
wife
of
a
prosperous
teamster
whose
were
seen
all
over
the
east
side
gaunt
with
a
solemn
masculine
face
she
was
known
for
her
jolly
disposition
and
sarcasm
there
was
something
suggestive
of
meyer
nodelman
in
her
manner
of
speaking
as
well
as
in
her
looks
she
was
childless
and
took
an
insatiable
interest
in
the
and
matrimonial
politics
of
young
people
her
name
was
kalch
but
everybody
called
her
auntie
yetta
when
ray
finished
playing
auntie
yetta
led
the
applause
for
all
the
world
like
a
ward
heeler
when
the
acclaim
had
died
down
she
rushed
at
ray
pressed
her
ample
bosom
to
her
own
flat
one
kissed
her
a
sounding
smack
on
the
lips
and
exclaimed
with
a
wink
to
me
ever
see
such
a
tasty
duck
of
a
girl
miss
kalmanovitch
was
followed
by
a
bespectacled
anemic
boy
of
thirteen
who
played
something
by
wieniavsky
on
the
violin
and
then
miss
kalmanovitch
obliged
us
with
a
recitation
from
macbeth
there
were
four
other
solos
on
the
piano
and
on
the
violin
by
boys
and
girls
children
of
the
invited
guests
the
violinists
having
brought
their
instruments
with
them
not
that
the
concert
was
part
of
a
preconceived
program
although
it
might
have
been
taken
for
granted
the
mothers
of
the
performers
had
simply
seized
the
opportunity
to
display
the
talents
of
their
offspring
before
an
audience
only
one
boy
a
little
pianist
introduced
as
bennie
saminsky
played
with
much
feeling
and
taste
all
the
rest
grated
on
my
nerves
i
beguiled
the
time
by
observing
the
women
i
noticed
for
instance
that
auntie
yetta
whose
fingers
were
a
veritable
now
and
again
made
a
pretense
of
smoothing
her
grayish
hair
for
the
purpose
of
exhibiting
her
flaming
rings
another
elderly
woman
whose
fingers
were
as
heavily
laden
kept
them
prominently
interlaced
across
her
breast
from
time
to
time
she
would
flirt
her
interlocked
hands
in
feigned
thus
flashing
her
diamonds
upon
the
people
around
her
at
one
moment
it
became
something
like
a
race
between
her
and
auntie
yetta
nodelman
cousin
caught
me
watching
it
whereupon
she
winked
to
me
merrily
and
interlaced
her
own
begemmed
fingers
as
much
as
to
say
what
do
you
think
of
our
contest
and
burst
into
a
voiceless
laugh
i
tried
to
listen
to
the
music
again
to
add
to
my
ordeal
i
had
to
lend
an
ear
to
the
boastful
chatter
of
the
mothers
or
fathers
on
the
virtuosity
of
bennie
sidney
beckie
or
sadie
the
mother
of
the
pianist
the
illiterate
wife
of
a
baker
first
wore
out
my
patience
and
then
enlisted
my
interest
by
a
torrent
of
musical
terminology
which
she
apparently
had
picked
up
from
talks
with
her
boy
she
interspersed
her
unsophisticated
yiddish
with
english
phrases
like
rare
technique
vonderful
touch
tone
or
poeytic
temperament
she
assured
me
that
her
son
was
the
youngest
boy
in
the
united
states
to
play
brahms
and
beethoven
successfully
at
first
i
thought
that
she
was
prattling
these
words
parrot
fashion
but
i
soon
realized
that
to
a
considerable
extent
at
least
she
used
them
intelligently
she
had
set
her
heart
upon
making
the
greatest
pianist
in
the
world
of
bennie
and
by
incessantly
discussing
him
with
people
who
were
supposed
to
know
something
about
music
she
had
gradually
accumulated
a
smattering
acquaintance
with
the
subject
that
she
was
full
of
it
there
could
be
no
doubt
perhaps
she
had
a
native
intuition
for
music
perhaps
too
it
was
from
her
that
her
son
had
inherited
his
feeling
for
the
poetry
of
sound
she
certainly
had
imagination
some
boys
play
like
monkeys
she
said
in
yiddish
they
know
what
they
are
at
may
i
know
evil
if
they
do
my
bennie
is
not
that
sort
of
a
pianist
thank
god
he
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
on
his
piano
i
mean
you
saw
for
yourself
that
he
played
with
head
and
heart
you
indeed
i
did
i
said
with
ardor
i
liked
his
playing
very
much
yes
it
comes
right
from
his
heart
she
pursued
he
has
a
golden
temperament
the
piano
just
talks
under
his
fingers
i
mean
what
i
say
people
think
a
piano
is
just
a
row
of
dead
pieces
of
bone
or
wood
it
is
not
no
sirrah
it
has
speech
just
like
a
human
being
provided
you
know
how
to
get
it
out
of
the
keyboard
bennie
does
in
a
certain
sense
this
unlettered
woman
was
being
educated
by
her
little
boy
in
the
same
manner
as
dora
had
been
and
still
was
perhaps
by
lucy
there
were
at
least
three
girls
in
the
gathering
who
were
decidedly
pretty
one
of
these
was
a
graduate
of
normal
college
she
was
like
miss
kalmanovitch
but
slender
and
supple
and
full
of
life
everybody
called
her
affectionately
by
her
first
name
which
was
stella
at
the
in
the
i
was
placed
beside
miss
kalmanovitch
but
i
gave
most
of
my
attention
to
stella
who
was
seated
diagonally
across
the
table
from
us
i
felt
quite
at
home
now
what
was
your
favorite
subject
at
college
i
questioned
stella
facetiously
that
my
secret
she
answered
i
can
guess
it
though
try
dancing
that
right
she
shouted
amidst
an
outburst
of
laughter
well
have
you
learned
it
well
i
went
on
why
do
you
ask
me
for
a
waltz
and
find
out
for
yourself
i
wish
i
could
but
unfortunately
they
did
not
take
up
dancing
at
my
college
did
you
go
to
college
stella
asked
seriously
i
do
look
like
one
who
did
i
suppose
well
i
should
like
to
say
i
did
but
i
have
the
heart
to
tell
you
a
lie
never
mind
nodelman
broke
in
he
an
educated
fellar
all
the
same
he
awful
educated
that
what
makes
him
such
a
smart
business
man
by
the
way
levinsky
how
is
the
merchandise
this
is
no
place
to
talk
shop
i
replied
deprecatingly
especially
when
there
are
so
many
pretty
ladies
around
that
right
several
of
the
women
chimed
in
in
chorus
nodelman
the
hostess
who
stood
in
the
doorway
beckoned
to
her
husband
and
he
jumped
up
from
the
table
as
he
passed
by
my
seat
i
seized
him
by
an
arm
and
whispered
into
his
ear
the
merchandise
is
too
heavy
i
want
lighter
goods
with
this
i
released
him
and
he
disappeared
with
nodelman
a
few
minutes
later
he
came
back
be
a
good
boy
show
ray
a
little
more
attention
he
whispered
into
my
ear
do
it
for
my
sake
will
you
all
right
i
became
aware
of
kalmanovitch
eyes
and
my
efforts
to
entertain
her
daughter
were
a
poor
performance
the
kalmanovitch
family
left
immediately
after
supper
scarcely
making
their
farewells
portentous
sounds
came
from
the
hallway
we
could
hear
kalmanovitch
angry
voice
a
nervous
hush
fell
over
the
parlor
auntie
yetta
gave
us
all
an
eloquent
wink
there
a
woman
with
a
tongue
for
you
she
said
in
an
undertone
pitch
and
sulphur
when
she
opens
her
mouth
people
had
better
sound
the
after
a
pause
she
added
do
you
know
why
her
teeth
are
so
bad
her
mouth
is
so
full
of
poison
it
has
eaten
them
up
presently
the
younger
nodelman
made
her
appearance
her
ruddy
face
was
fairly
ablaze
with
excitement
her
husband
followed
with
a
guilty
air
what
the
matter
with
you
folks
the
hostess
said
why
ainchye

somethin
what

the
baker

answered
in
yiddish

eaten
a
nice
supper

are

in
the
manner
of
a
boy
addressing
his
teacher

asked
awkwardly

wo

she
returned
making
an
effort
to
look

straight
in
the
face
sure
sure
with
a
laugh
what
is
it
you
want
to
ask
me
about

again
assuming
the
tone
of
a
penitent
pupil
i
said

said
gaily
she

dead
stuck
on
her
intended
they
be
married
in
june
i
went
home
a
lovesick
man
but
the
following
evening
i
went
to
boston
for
a
day
and
my
feeling
did
not
survive
the
trip
chapter
v
that
journey
to
boston
is
fixed
in
my
memory
by
an
incident
which
is
one
of
my
landmarks
in
the
history
of
my
financial
evolution
and
indeed
in
the
history
of
the
american
cloak
industry
it
occurred
in
the
afternoon
of
the
monday
which
i
spent
in
that
city
less
than
two
days
after
that
birthday
party
at
the
nodelmans
i
was
lounging
in
an
in
the
lobby
of
my
hotel
when
i
beheld
loeb
the
star
salesman
of
what
had
been
the
star
firm
in
the
business
i
had
not
seen
him
for
some
time
but
i
knew
that
his
employers
were
on
their
last
legs
and
that
he
had
a
hard
struggle
trying
to
make
a
living
nor
was
that
firm
the
only
one
of
the
concerns
that
found
itself
in
this
state
at
the
period
in
question
that
is
at
the
time
of
the
economic
crisis
and
the
burst
of
good
times
that
had
succeeded
it
far
from
filling
their
coffers
from
the
golden
flood
of
those
few
years
they
were
drowned
in
it
almost
to
a
man
the
trade
was
now
in
the
hands
of
men
from
the
ranks
of
their
former
employees
tailors
or
cloak
operators
of
russian
or
galician
origin
some
of
whom
were
talmudic
scholars
like
myself
it
was
the
passing
of
the
german
jew
from
the
american
cloak
industry
we
did
profit
by
the
abundance
of
the
period
moreover
there
were
many
among
us
to
whom
the
crisis
of
had
proved
a
blessing
to
begin
with
some
of
our
tailors
being
unable
to
obtain
employment
in
that
year
had
been
driven
to
make
up
a
garment
or
two
and
to
offer
it
for
sale
in
the
street
huckster
fashion
a
venture
which
in
many
instances
formed
a
to
a
others
of
our
workmen
had
achieved
the
same
evolution
by
employing
their
days
of
enforced
idleness
in
taking
lessons
in
and
then
setting
up
a
small
shop
of
their
own
newfangled
manufacturers
of
this
kind
were
now
springing
up
like
mushrooms
joe
my
instructor
in
was
one
of
the
latest
additions
to
their
number
they
worked
often
assisted
by
their
wives
and
children
in
all
sorts
of
capacities
and
at
all
hours
they
lived
on
bread
and
salmon
and
were
content
with
almost
a
nominal
margin
of
profit
there
were
instances
when
the
clippings
from
the
constituted
all
the
profit
the
business
yielded
them
pitted
against
manufacturers
of
this
class
or
against
a
fellow
like
myself
were
the
firms
with
their
dignified
office
methods
and
high
firms
whose
fortunes
had
been
sorely
tried
to
boot
by
their
bitter
struggle
with
the
union
loeb
swaggered
up
to
me
with
quizzical
joviality
as
usual
but
the
smug
luster
of
his
face
was
faded
and
his
kindly
black
eyes
had
an
unsteady
glance
in
them
that
belied
his
vivacity
i
could
see
at
once
that
he
felt
nothing
but
hate
for
me
hello
levinsky
he
greeted
me
have
seen
you
for
an
age
how
are
you
loeb
i
asked
genially
my
heart
full
of
mixed
triumph
and
compassion
we
had
not
been
talking
five
minutes
before
he
grew
sardonic
and
venomous
as
division
street
a
few
blocks
on
the
lower
east
side
was
the
center
of
the
new
type
of
he
referred
to
us
by
the
name
of
that
street
my
business
was
on
broadway
yet
i
was
included
in
the
term
division
street
manufacturer
what
is
division
street
going
to
do
next
he
asked
sell
a
suit
for
fifteen
cents
i
smiled
that
a
great
place
that
is
there
are
two
big
business
streets
in
new
york
wall
street
and
division
he
broke
into
a
laugh
at
his
own
joke
and
i
charitably
joined
in
i
endeavored
to
take
his
thrusts
and
for
many
minutes
i
succeeded
but
at
one
point
when
he
referred
to
us
as
manufacturers
with
a
sneering
implication
of
quotation
marks
over
the
word
i
flared
up
you
do
seem
to
like
the
division
street
manufacturers
do
you
i
said
i
suppose
you
have
a
reason
for
it
i
have
a
reason
of
course
i
have
he
retorted
so
has
every
other
decent
man
in
the
business
it
depends
on
what
you
call
decent
every
misfit
claims
to
be
more
decent
than
the
fellow
who
gets
the
business
he
grew
pale
it
almost
looked
as
though
we
were
coming
to
blows
after
a
pause
he
said
with
an
effect
of
holding
himself
in
leash
business
do
you
call
that
business
i
call
it
peanuts
well
the
peanuts
are
rapidly
growing
in
size
while
the
oranges
and
the
apples
are
shrinking
and
rotting
the
fittest
survives
a
lot
he
knows
about
the
theory
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
i
jeered
in
my
heart
he
has
even
heard
the
name
of
herbert
spencer
peanuts
are
peanuts
that
all
there
to
it
he
returned
then
why
are
you
excited
how
can
we
hurt
you
if
we
are
only
peanuts
he
made
no
answer
we
do
steal
the
trade
we
getting
do
we
if
the
american
people
prefer
to
buy
our
product
they
probably
like
it
oh
chuck
your
big
words
levinsky
you
fellows
are
killing
the
trade
and
you
know
it
he
laughed
but
what
i
said
was
true
the
old
the
german
jews
were
merely
merchant
our
people
on
the
other
hand
were
mostly
tailors
or
cloak
operators
who
had
learned
the
mechanical
part
of
the
industry
and
they
were
introducing
a
thousand
innovations
into
it
perfecting
revolutionizing
it
we
brought
to
our
work
a
knowledge
a
taste
and
an
ardor
which
the
men
of
the
old
firms
did
not
possess
and
we
were
shedding
our
uncouthness
too
in
proportion
as
we
grew
we
adapted
american
business
ways
speaking
in
a
vein
loeb
went
on
citing
cases
of
what
he
termed
cutthroat
competition
on
our
part
till
he
worked
himself
into
a
passion
and
became
abusive
again
the
drift
of
his
harangue
was
that
smashing
prices
was
something
distasteful
to
the
american
spirit
that
we
were
only
foreigners
products
of
an
inferior
civilization
and
that
we
ought
to
know
our
place
this
way
of
doing
business
may
be
all
right
in
russia
but
it
do
in
this
country
he
said
i
tell
you
it
wo
do
but
it
does
do
so
it
seems
as
he
continued
to
fume
and
rail
at
us
and
i
sat
listening
with
a
bored
air
an
idea
flashed
upon
my
mind
and
acting
upon
it
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
suddenly
laid
a
friendly
hand
on
his
arm
look
here
loeb
i
said
what
the
use
being
excited
i
have
a
scheme
what
the
matter
with
you
selling
goods
for
me
he
was
taken
aback
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
going
to
accept
it
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
flushing
i
mean
what
i
say
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
you
will
make
more
money
than
you
have
ever
made
before
you
a
salesman
loeb
and
well
it
will
pay
you
to
make
the
change
what
do
you
say
he
contemplated
the
floor
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
looking
up
awkwardly
he
said
i
think
it
over
but
you
a
smart
fellow
levinsky
i
can
tell
you
that
we
proceeded
to
discuss
details
and
i
received
his
answer
a
favorable
one
before
we
left
our
seats
to
celebrate
the
event
i
had
him
dine
with
me
that
evening
our
pledges
of
mutual
loyalty
being
solemnized
by
a
toast
which
we
drank
in
the
costliest
champagne
the
hotel
restaurant
could
furnish
it
was
not
a
year
and
a
half
after
this
episode
that
chaikin
entered
my
employ
as
designer
chapter
vi
i
saw
other
girls
with
a
view
to
marriage
but
i
was
too
particular
as
my
friends
the
nodelmans
would
have
it
i
had
two
narrow
escapes
from
suits
he
has
too
much
education
nodelman
once
said
to
his
wife
in
my
presence
too
much
in
his
head
do
you
know
you
think
too
much
levinsky
that
what
the
matter
first
marry
and
do
your
thinking
afterward
if
you
stopped
to
think
before
eating
you
would
starve
to
death
would
you
well
and
if
you
keep
on
thinking
and
figuring
if
this
girl
nose
is
nice
enough
and
if
that
girl
eyes
are
nice
enough
you
die
before
you
get
married
and
there
are
no
weddings
among
the
dead
you
know
my
matrimonial
aspirations
made
themselves
felt
with
fits
and
starts
there
were
periods
when
i
seemed
to
be
completely
in
their
grip
when
i
was
restless
and
as
though
ready
to
marry
the
first
girl
i
met
then
there
would
be
many
months
during
which
i
was
utterly
indifferent
enjoying
my
freedom
and
putting
off
the
question
indefinitely
year
after
year
slid
by
when
my
birthday
became
a
thing
of
the
past
and
i
saw
myself
entering
upon
my
fortieth
year
without
knowing
who
i
worked
for
i
was
in
something
like
a
state
of
despair
when
i
was
a
boy
forty
years
had
seemed
to
be
the
beginning
of
old
age
this
notion
i
now
repudiated
as
ridiculous
for
i
felt
as
young
as
i
had
done
ten
fifteen
or
twenty
years
before
and
yet
the
words
forty
years
appalled
me
the
wish
to
settle
down
then
grew
into
a
passion
in
me
the
vague
portrait
of
a
woman
in
the
abstract
seemed
never
to
be
absent
from
my
mind
coupled
with
that
portrait
was
a
similarly
vague
image
of
a
window
and
a
table
set
for
dinner
that
somehow
was
my
symbol
of
home
home
and
woman
were
one
a
complex
charm
joining
them
into
an
inseparable
force
there
was
the
glamour
of
sex
shelter
and
companionship
in
that
charm
and
of
something
else
that
promised
security
and
perpetuity
to
the
successes
that
fate
was
pouring
into
my
lap
it
whispered
of
a
future
that
was
to
continue
after
i
was
gone
my
loneliness
often
took
on
the
pungence
of
acute
physical
discomfort
the
more
i
achieved
the
more
painful
was
my
nothing
seemed
to
matter
unless
it
was
sanctified
by
marriage
and
marriage
now
mattered
far
more
than
love
girls
had
acquired
a
new
meaning
they
were
not
merely
girls
they
were
matrimonial
possibilities
odd
as
it
may
appear
my
romantic
ideals
of
twenty
years
ago
now
reasserted
their
claim
upon
me
it
was
my
ambition
to
marry
into
some
orthodox
family
well
connected
and
with
an
atmosphere
of
talmudic
education
the
kind
of
match
of
which
i
had
dreamed
before
my
mother
died
with
such
modifications
as
the
american
environment
rendered
natural
there
were
two
distinct
circumstances
to
account
for
this
new
mood
in
me
in
the
first
place
my
sense
of
approaching
middle
age
somehow
rekindled
my
yearning
interest
in
the
scenes
of
my
childhood
and
boyhood
memories
of
bygone
days
had
become
ineffably
dear
to
me
i
seemed
to
remember
things
of
my
boyhood
more
vividly
than
i
did
things
that
had
happened
only
a
year
before
i
was
homesick
for
antomir
again
to
revisit
abner
court
or
the
preacher
synagogue
to
speak
to
reb
sender
or
to
the
bewhiskered
old
soldier
the
skeepskin
tailor
if
they
were
still
living
was
one
of
my
eliakim
zunzer
the
famous
whose
songs
my
mother
used
to
sing
in
her
dear
sonorous
contralto
had
emigrated
to
america
several
years
before
and
i
had
heard
of
it
at
the
time
of
his
arrival
yet
i
had
never
thought
of
going
to
see
him
now
however
i
could
not
rest
until
i
looked
him
up
it
appeared
that
he
owned
a
small
in
a
basement
on
east
broadway
so
i
called
at
his
place
one
afternoon
on
the
pretext
of
ordering
some
cards
when
i
saw
the
poet
an
aged
little
man
with
a
tragic
tired
look
on
a
cadaverous
face
i
was
so
unstrung
that
when
a
young
man
in
the
shop
asked
me
something
about
the
cards
he
had
to
repeat
the
question
before
i
understood
it
my
mother
used
to
sing
your
beautiful
songs
zunzer
i
said
to
the
poet
some
minutes
later
my
heart
beating
violently
again
did
she
where
do
you
come
from
he
asked
with
a
smile
that
banished
the
tired
look
but
deepened
the
tragic
sadness
of
his
countenance
everything
bearing
the
name
of
my
native
place
touched
a
tender
spot
in
my
heart
it
was
enough
for
a
to
ask
me
for
a
job
with
the
antomir
accent
to
be
favorably
recommended
to
one
of
my
foremen
a
number
of
the
men
who
received
special
consideration
and
were
kept
working
in
my
shop
in
the
slack
seasons
when
my
force
was
greatly
reduced
were
of
mine
this
had
been
going
on
for
several
years
in
fact
till
gradually
an
antomir
atmosphere
had
been
established
in
my
shop
and
something
like
a
family
spirit
of
which
i
was
proud
we
had
formed
a
levinsky
antomir
benefit
society
of
which
i
was
an
honorary
member
and
which
was
made
up
for
the
most
part
of
my
own
employees
all
this
i
confess
was
not
without
advantage
to
my
business
interests
for
it
afforded
me
a
low
average
of
wages
and
safeguarded
my
shop
against
labor
troubles
the
union
had
again
come
into
existence
and
although
it
had
no
real
power
over
the
men
the
trade
was
not
free
from
sporadic
conflicts
in
individual
shops
my
place
however
was
absolutely
immune
from
difficulties
of
this
sort
all
because
of
the
levinsky
antomir
benefit
society
if
one
of
my
operatives
happened
to
have
a
relative
in
antomir
a
women
tailor
who
wished
to
emigrate
to
america
i
would
advance
him
the
passage
money
with
the
understanding
that
he
was
to
work
off
the
loan
in
my
employ
that
the
green
one
was
to
work
for
low
wages
was
a
matter
of
course
but
then
in
justice
to
myself
i
must
add
that
i
did
my
men
favors
in
numerous
cases
that
could
in
no
way
redound
to
my
benefit
besides
the
fiscal
advantages
that
i
did
derive
from
the
antomir
spirit
of
my
shop
really
were
not
a
primary
consideration
with
me
i
sincerely
cherished
that
spirit
for
its
own
sake
moreover
if
my
antomir
employees
were
willing
to
accept
from
me
lower
pay
than
they
might
have
received
in
other
places
their
average
earnings
were
actually
higher
than
they
would
have
been
elsewhere
i
gave
them
steady
work
besides
they
felt
perfectly
at
home
in
my
shop
i
treated
them
well
i
was
very
democratic
compared
to
the
thoughts
of
home
that
had
oppressed
me
during
my
first
months
in
america
my
new
visions
of
antomir
were
like
the
wistful
lights
of
a
sunset
as
compared
with
the
glare
of
midday
but
then
sunsets
produce
deeper
if
quieter
effects
on
the
emotions
than
the
strongest
daylight
it
was
my
new
homesickness
then
which
inclined
me
to
an
american
form
of
the
kind
of
marriage
of
which
i
used
to
dream
in
the
days
of
my
talmudic
studies
another
motive
that
led
me
to
matrimonial
aspirations
of
this
kind
lay
in
my
new
ideas
of
respectability
as
a
necessary
accompaniment
to
success
marrying
into
a
orthodox
family
meant
respectability
and
solidity
it
implied
law
and
order
the
antithesis
of
anarchism
socialism
strikes
i
was
a
convinced
spencer
unknowable
had
irrevocably
replaced
my
god
yet
religion
now
appealed
to
me
as
an
indispensable
instrument
in
the
great
orchestra
of
things
from
what
i
had
seen
of
the
world
or
read
about
it
in
the
daily
press
i
was
convinced
that
but
few
people
of
wealth
and
power
had
real
religion
in
their
hearts
i
felt
sure
that
most
of
them
looked
upon
churches
or
synagogues
as
they
did
upon
that
they
valued
them
primarily
as
safeguards
of
law
and
order
and
correctness
and
this
had
become
my
attitude
for
the
rest
i
felt
that
a
vast
number
of
the
people
who
professed
christianity
or
judaism
did
so
merely
because
to
declare
oneself
an
atheist
was
not
a
prudent
thing
to
do
from
a
business
or
social
point
of
view
or
that
they
were
in
doubt
and
chose
to
be
on
the
safe
side
of
it
lest
there
should
be
a
god
after
all
while
millions
of
other
people
were
not
interested
enough
even
to
doubt
or
to
ask
questions
and
were
content
to
do
as
everybody
did
but
there
were
some
who
did
ask
questions
and
did
dare
to
declare
themselves
atheists
i
was
one
of
these
and
yet
i
looked
upon
religion
as
a
most
important
institution
and
was
willing
to
contribute
to
its
support
my
business
life
had
fostered
the
conviction
in
me
that
outside
of
the
family
the
human
world
was
as
brutally
selfish
as
the
jungle
and
that
it
was
with
hypocrisy
into
the
bargain
from
time
to
time
the
newspapers
published
sensational
revelations
concerning
some
pillar
of
society
who
had
turned
out
to
be
a
common
thief
on
an
uncommon
scale
i
saw
that
political
speeches
sermons
and
editorials
had
with
very
few
exceptions
no
more
sincerity
in
them
than
the
rhetoric
of
an
advertisement
i
saw
that
americans
who
boasted
descent
from
the
heroes
of
the
revolution
boasted
in
the
same
breath
of
having
spent
an
evening
with
lord
that
it
was
their
avowed
ambition
to
acquire
for
their
daughters
the
very
titles
which
their
ancestors
had
fought
to
banish
from
the
life
of
their
country
i
saw
that
civilization
was
honeycombed
with
what
max
nordau
called
conventional
lies
with
sham
ecstasy
sham
sympathy
sham
smiles
sham
laughter
the
riot
of
prosperity
introduced
the
fashion
of
respectable
women
covering
their
faces
with
powder
and
paint
in
a
way
that
had
hitherto
been
peculiar
to
women
of
the
streets
so
i
pictured
civilization
as
a
harlot
with
cheeks
lips
and
eyelashes
of
artificial
beauty
i
imagined
mountains
of
powder
and
paint
a
deafening
chorus
of
affected
laughter
a
huge
heart
as
large
as
a
city
full
of
falsehood
and
mischief
the
leaders
of
the
jewish
socialists
who
were
also
at
the
head
of
the
jewish
labor
movement
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
most
repulsive
hypocrites
of
all
i
loathed
them
i
had
no
creed
i
knew
of
no
ideals
the
only
thing
i
believed
in
was
the
cold
drab
theory
of
the
struggle
for
existence
and
the
survival
of
the
fittest
this
could
not
satisfy
a
heart
that
was
hungry
for
enthusiasm
and
affection
so
dreams
of
family
life
became
my
religion
devotion
to
one
family
was
the
only
kind
of
altruism
and
idealism
i
did
not
flout
i
was
worth
over
a
million
and
my
profits
had
reached
enormous
dimensions
so
i
was
regarded
a
most
desirable
match
and
pestered
me
as
much
as
i
would
let
them
but
they
found
me
a
hard
man
to
suit
there
was
a
homesick
young
man
in
my
shop
a
native
of
antomir
with
whom
i
often
chatted
of
our
common
birthplace
his
name
was
mirmelstein
he
was
a
little
fellow
with
a
massive
head
and
a
neck
that
seemed
to
be
too
slender
to
support
it
i
liked
his
face
for
its
honest
ingenuous
expression
but
more
especially
because
i
thought
his
eyes
had
a
homesick
look
in
them
he
was
a
poor
mechanic
but
i
found
him
a
steady
job
in
my
shipping
department
he
could
furnish
me
no
information
about
reb
sender
of
whom
he
had
never
heard
before
he
knew
of
the
minsker
family
of
course
and
he
told
me
that
shiphrah
matilda
mother
was
dead
that
yeffim
matilda
brother
had
been
sent
to
siberia
some
three
years
before
for
complicity
in
the
revolutionary
movement
and
that
matilda
herself
had
had
a
escape
from
arrest
and
was
living
in
switzerland
he
wrote
to
antomir
and
a
few
weeks
later
he
brought
me
the
sad
information
that
reb
sender
had
been
dead
for
several
years
and
that
his
wife
had
married
again
chapter
vii
one
day
in
november
less
than
six
months
after
i
had
learned
of
yeffim
minsker
arrest
and
of
matilda
escape
as
i
was
making
the
rounds
of
my
several
departments
little
mirmelstein
accosted
me
timidly
yeffim
minsker
and
his
sister
are
here
he
said
with
the
smile
of
one
breaking
an
interesting
surprise
i
paused
flushing
i
feigned
indifference
and
preoccupation
but
the
next
moment
i
cast
off
all
pretense
are
they
really
i
asked
he
produced
a
clipping
from
a
socialist
yiddish
daily
containing
an
advertisement
of
a
public
meeting
to
be
held
at
cooper
institute
under
the
auspices
of
an
organization
of
russian
revolutionists
for
the
purpose
of
welcoming
yefflm
and
another
man
a
doctor
gorsky
both
of
whom
had
recently
escaped
from
siberia
the
revolutionary
movement
was
then
at
its
height
in
russia
and
the
jews
were
among
its
foremost
and
bravest
leaders
which
by
the
way
accounts
for
the
riots
and
massacres
which
the
government
inspired
and
encouraged
quite
openly
as
was
mentioned
in
an
early
chapter
of
this
book
the
then
minister
of
the
interior
was
the
same
man
who
had
been
director
of
police
over
the
whole
empire
at
the
time
of
the
riots
which
followed
the
assassination
of
czar
alexander
ii
in
and
which
started
the
great
emigration
of
jews
to
america
from
time
to
time
some
distinguished
revolutionist
would
be
sent
to
america
for
subscriptions
to
the
cause
this
was
the
mission
of
doctor
gorsky
and
yeffim
they
were
here
not
as
immigrants
but
merely
to
raise
funds
for
the
movement
at
home
as
for
matilda
it
appeared
that
doctor
gorsky
was
her
husband
whether
he
had
married
her
in
russia
before
his
arrest
or
in
switzerland
where
he
and
her
brother
had
spent
some
time
after
their
escape
from
exile
mirmelstein
could
not
tell
me
name
was
not
mentioned
in
the
advertisement
but
my
had
heard
of
her
arrival
and
marriage
from
some
antomir
people
i
could
scarcely
do
anything
that
day
i
was
in
a
fever
of
excitement
do
i
still
love
her
i
wondered
i
made
up
my
mind
to
attend
the
cooper
institute
meeting
it
was
a
bold
venture
for
the
crowd
was
sure
to
contain
some
socialist
who
held
me
in
anything
but
esteem
but
then
i
had
not
had
a
strike
in
my
shop
for
several
years
and
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
they
would
offer
me
an
insult
anyhow
the
temptation
to
see
matilda
was
too
strong
i
had
to
go
she
was
certain
to
be
on
the
platform
and
all
i
wanted
was
to
take
a
look
at
her
from
the
auditorium
and
who
knows
but
i
may
have
a
chance
to
speak
to
her
too
i
thought
it
was
a
cold
evening
in
the
latter
part
of
november
i
went
to
the
meeting
in
my
expensive
fur
coat
although
fur
coats
were
still
a
rare
spectacle
in
the
streets
with
a
secret
foretaste
of
the
impression
my
prosperity
would
make
upon
matilda
it
was
a
fatal
mistake
it
was
twenty
minutes
to
when
i
reached
the
front
door
of
the
historical
but
it
was
already
crowded
to
overflowing
and
the
policemen
guarding
the
brightly
illuminated
entrance
tumed
me
away
with
a
crowd
of
others
i
was
in
despair
i
tried
again
and
this
time
apparently
owing
to
my
mink
coat
i
was
admitted
every
seat
in
the
vast
underground
auditorium
was
occupied
but
few
people
were
allowed
to
stand
in
the
rear
of
the
hall
and
i
was
one
of
them
from
the
chat
i
overheard
around
me
i
gathered
that
there
were
scores
of
men
and
women
in
the
audience
who
had
been
in
the
thick
of
sensational
conflicts
in
the
great
crusade
for
liberty
that
was
then
going
on
in
russia
i
questioned
a
man
who
stood
beside
me
about
doctor
gorsky
and
from
his
answers
i
gained
the
impression
that
matilda
husband
was
considered
one
of
the
pluckiest
men
in
the
struggle
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
he
was
practising
medicine
ranged
on
the
platform
on
either
side
of
the
speaker
desk
were
about
a
hundred
chairs
several
of
which
in
the
two
front
rows
were
kept
vacant
presently
there
was
a
stir
on
the
platform
a
group
of
men
and
women
made
their
appearance
and
seated
themselves
on
the
unoccupied
chairs
they
were
greeted
with
passionate
cheers
and
applause
one
of
them
was
matilda
i
recognized
her
at
once
her
curly
brown
hair
was
gray
at
the
temples
and
her
oval
little
face
was
somewhat
bloated
and
she
was
stouter
than
she
had
been
years
before
but
all
this
was
merely
like
a
new
dress
had
i
met
her
in
the
street
i
might
have
merely
felt
that
she
looked
familiar
to
me
without
being
able
to
trace
her
as
it
was
she
was
strikingly
the
same
as
i
had
known
her
though
not
precisely
the
same
as
i
had
pictured
her
of
late
years
at
least
some
errors
had
stolen
into
my
image
of
her
and
now
that
i
saw
her
in
the
flesh
i
recalled
her
likeness
of
years
before
and
she
now
looked
precisely
as
she
had
done
then
she
was
as
interesting
as
ever
i
was
in
such
a
turmoil
that
i
scarcely
knew
what
was
happening
on
the
platform
did
i
still
love
her
or
was
it
merely
the
excitement
of
beholding
a
living
memory
of
my
youth
one
thing
was
certain
the
feeling
of
reverence
and
awe
with
which
i
had
once
been
wont
to
view
her
and
her
parents
was
stirring
in
my
heart
again
for
the
moment
i
did
not
seem
to
be
the
man
who
owned
a
big
and
was
worth
over
a
million
american
dollars
the
chairman
had
been
speaking
for
some
time
before
i
became
aware
of
his
existence
as
his
address
was
in
russian
and
i
had
long
since
unlearned
what
little
i
had
ever
known
of
that
language
his
words
were
greek
to
me
matilda
was
flanked
by
two
men
both
with
full
beards
one
fair
and
the
other
rather
dark
the
one
of
the
fair
complexion
and
beard
was
yeffim
although
i
recognized
him
by
his
resemblance
to
matilda
and
more
especially
to
her
father
rather
than
by
his
image
of
years
ago
i
supposed
that
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
her
the
one
with
the
dark
beard
was
her
husband
and
i
asked
the
man
by
my
side
about
it
but
he
did
not
know
several
speakers
made
brief
addresses
of
welcome
one
of
these
spoke
in
yiddish
and
one
in
english
so
i
understood
them
they
dealt
with
the
revolution
and
the
atrocities
and
paid
glowing
tributes
to
the
they
were
interrupted
by
outburst
after
outburst
of
enthusiasm
and
indignation
when
finally
doctor
gorsky
was
introduced
it
was
the
man
with
the
dark
beard
there
was
a
veritable
pandemonium
of
applause
cheers
and
ejaculations
that
lasted
many
minutes
he
spoke
in
russian
and
he
seemed
to
be
a
poor
speaker
i
searched
his
face
for
evidence
of
valor
and
strength
but
did
not
seem
to
find
any
i
thought
it
was
rather
a
weak
face
weak
and
kindly
and
his
beard
which
was
long
and
thin
did
not
become
him
i
asked
myself
whether
i
was
jealous
of
him
and
the
question
seemed
so
incongruous
so
remote
he
made
a
good
impression
on
me
the
fact
that
this
man
who
was
possessed
of
indomitable
courage
had
a
weak
face
interested
me
greatly
and
the
fact
that
he
had
gone
through
much
suffering
made
a
strong
appeal
to
my
sympathies
somehow
his
martyrdom
was
linked
in
my
mind
to
his
futility
as
a
speaker
i
warmed
to
him
he
was
followed
by
yeffim
and
the
scene
of
wild
enthusiasm
was
repeated
when
minsker
had
finished
the
chairman
declared
the
meeting
closed
there
was
a
rush
for
the
platform
it
was
quite
high
above
the
auditorium
floor
unless
one
reached
it
by
way
of
the
which
was
a
considerable
distance
to
the
right
it
had
to
be
mounted
not
without
an
effort
by
means
of
the
chairs
in
the
press
inclosure
after
some
hesitation
i
made
a
dash
for
one
of
these
chairs
and
the
next
minute
i
was
within
three
or
four
feet
from
matilda
but
with
an
excited
crowd
between
us
everybody
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
the
heroes
the
jam
and
scramble
were
so
great
that
doctor
gorsky
yeffim
and
matilda
had
to
extricate
themselves
and
to
escape
into
the
spacious
in
the
rear
of
the
platform
some
minutes
later
i
stood
by
her
side
in
that
room
amid
a
cluster
of
revolutionists
her
husband
and
yeffim
being
each
the
center
of
another
crowd
in
the
same
room
i
beg
your
pardon
i
began
with
a
sheepish
smile
do
you
know
me
her
glittering
brown
eyes
fixed
me
with
a
curious
look
my
name
is
david
levinsky
i
added
the
talmudic
student
to
whom
you
gave
money
with
which
to
go
to
america
of
course
i
know
you
she
snapped
taking
stock
of
my
mink
overcoat
and
i
have
heard
about
you
too
you
have
a
lot
of
money
have
you
i
see
you
are
wearing
a
costly
fur
coat
and
she
brutally
turned
to
speak
to
somebody
else
my
heart
stood
still
i
wanted
to
say
something
to
assure
her
that
i
was
not
so
black
as
the
socialists
painted
me
i
had
an
impulse
to
offer
her
a
generous
contribution
to
the
cause
but
i
had
not
the
courage
to
open
my
mouth
again
the
bystanders
were
eying
me
with
glances
that
seemed
to
say
the
idea
of
a
fellow
like
this
being
here
i
was
a
despicable
bourgeois
a
capitalist
of
the
kind
whose
presence
at
a
socialist
meeting
was
a
sacrilege
i
slunk
out
of
the
room
feeling
like
a
whipped
cur
why
she
is
a
perfect
savage
i
thought
but
then
what
else
can
you
expect
of
a
socialist
i
thought
of
the
scenes
that
had
passed
between
her
and
myself
in
her
mother
house
and
i
sneered
a
socialist
a
good
pure
soul
indeed
i
mused
gloatingly
that
exactly
like
them
a
bunch
of
hypocrites
that
all
they
are
at
the
same
time
i
was
nagging
myself
for
having
had
so
little
sense
as
to
sport
my
prosperity
before
a
socialist
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
a
few
days
later
the
episode
seemed
to
have
occurred
many
years
before
it
did
not
bother
me
nor
did
matilda
chapter
viii
it
was
an
afternoon
in
april
my
chief
bookkeeper
one
of
my
stenographers
bender
and
myself
were
hard
at
work
at
my
broadway
factory
amid
a
muffled
turmoil
of
industry
there
were
important
questions
of
credit
to
dispose
of
and
letters
to
answer
i
was
taking
up
account
after
account
weighing
my
data
with
the
utmost
care
giving
every
detail
my
closest
attention
and
all
the
while
i
was
thus
absorbed
seemingly
oblivious
to
everything
else
i
was
alive
to
the
fact
that
it
was
passover
and
the
eve
of
the
anniversary
of
my
mother
death
that
three
or
four
hours
later
i
should
be
solemnizing
her
memorial
day
at
the
new
synagogue
of
the
sons
of
antomir
that
while
there
i
should
sit
next
to
kaplan
a
man
to
whose
daughter
i
had
recently
become
engaged
and
that
after
the
service
i
was
to
accompany
kaplan
to
his
house
and
spend
the
evening
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
by
the
side
of
the
girl
that
was
soon
to
become
my
wife
my
consciousness
of
all
this
grew
keener
every
minute
till
it
began
to
interfere
with
my
work
i
was
getting
fidgety
finally
i
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
i
washed
myself
combed
my
plentiful
crop
of
dark
hair
carefully
brushed
myself
and
put
on
my
spring
overcoat
and
derby
hat
both
of
a
hue
i
be
back
until
the
day
after
i
announced
to
bender
after
giving
him
some
orders
till
day
after
he
said
with
reproachful
amazement
i
nodded
ca
you
put
it
off
this
is
no
time
for
being
away
he
grumbled
it
ca
be
helped
you
not
going
out
of
town
are
you
what
difference
does
it
make
after
a
pause
i
added
it
is
on
business
it
a
private
matter
oh
he
uttered
with
evident
relief
nothing
hurt
his
pride
more
than
to
suspect
me
of
having
business
secrets
from
him
he
was
a
married
man
now
having
less
than
a
year
ago
wedded
a
sweet
little
girl
a
cousin
who
was
as
and
as
himself
and
to
whom
he
had
practically
been
engaged
since
boyhood
his
salary
was
one
hundred
and
dollars
a
week
now
i
was
at
home
in
their
little
establishment
the
sunshine
that
filled
it
having
given
an
added
impulse
to
my
matrimonial
aspirations
i
betook
myself
to
the
new
antomir
synagogue
the
congregation
had
greatly
grown
in
prosperity
and
had
recently
moved
from
the
ramshackle
little
frame
building
that
had
been
its
home
into
an
impressive
granite
structure
formerly
a
presbyterian
church
this
was
my
first
visit
to
the
building
indeed
i
had
not
seen
the
inside
of
its
predecessor
the
little
old
house
of
prayer
that
had
borne
the
name
of
my
native
town
years
before
it
was
abandoned
in
former
years
even
some
time
after
i
had
become
a
convinced
i
had
visited
it
at
least
twice
a
my
two
memorial
days
that
is
on
the
anniversaries
of
the
death
of
my
parents
i
had
not
done
so
since
i
had
read
spencer
this
time
however
the
anniversary
of
my
death
had
a
peculiar
meaning
for
me
vaguely
as
a
result
of
my
new
mood
and
distinctly
as
a
result
of
my
betrothal
i
was
lured
to
the
synagogue
by
a
force
against
which
my
spencerian
agnosticism
was
powerless
i
found
the
interior
of
the
building
brilliantly
illuminated
the
woodwork
of
the
stand
and
the
bible
platform
the
curtains
of
the
holy
ark
and
the
fresco
paintings
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
screamingly
new
and
gaudy
so
were
the
ornamental
electric
fixtures
altogether
the
place
reminded
me
of
a
reformed
german
synagogue
rather
than
of
the
kind
with
which
my
idea
of
judaism
had
always
been
identified
this
seemed
to
accentuate
the
fact
that
the
building
had
until
recently
been
a
christian
church
the
glaring
electric
lights
and
the
glittering
decorations
struck
me
as
something
unholy
still
the
scattered
handful
of
worshipers
i
found
there
and
more
particularly
the
beadle
looked
orthodox
enough
and
i
gradually
became
reconciled
to
the
place
as
a
house
of
god
the
beadle
was
a
new
incumbent
better
dressed
and
with
more
authority
in
his
appearance
than
the
man
who
had
superintended
the
old
place
he
comported
well
with
the
look
of
things
in
the
new
synagogue
after
obsequiously
directing
me
to
the
pew
of
my
prospective
who
had
not
yet
arrived
he
inserted
a
stout
tall
candle
into
one
of
the
sockets
of
the
stand
and
lit
it
it
was
mine
it
was
to
burn
uninterruptedly
for
my
mother
soul
for
the
next
hours
kaplan
pew
was
in
a
place
of
honor
that
is
by
the
east
wall
near
the
holy
ark
to
see
my
memorial
candle
i
had
to
take
a
few
steps
back
i
did
so
and
as
i
watched
its
flame
memories
and
images
took
possession
of
me
that
turned
my
present
life
into
a
dream
and
my
russian
past
into
reality
according
to
the
talmud
there
is
a
close
affinity
between
the
human
soul
and
light
for
the
spirit
of
man
is
the
lamp
of
god
as
solomon
puts
it
in
his
parables
hence
the
custom
of
lighting
candles
or
lamps
for
the
dead
and
so
as
i
gazed
at
that
huge
candle
commemorating
the
day
when
my
mother
gave
her
life
for
me
i
felt
as
though
its
light
was
part
of
her
spirit
the
gentle
flutter
of
its
flame
seemed
to
be
speaking
in
the
sacred
whisper
of
a
mother
dear
mother
dear
my
heart
was
saying
and
then
thank
god
mother
dear
i
own
a
large
factory
i
am
a
rich
man
and
i
am
going
to
be
married
to
the
daughter
of
a
fine
jew
a
man
of
substance
and
talmud
and
the
family
comes
from
around
antomir
too
ah
if
you
were
here
to
escort
me
to
the
wedding
canopy
the
number
of
worshipers
was
slowly
increasing
an
old
woman
made
her
appearance
in
the
gallery
reserved
for
her
sex
at
last
kaplan
the
father
of
my
fiancée
entered
the
synagogue
a
man
of
sixty
with
a
gray
patriarchal
beard
and
a
general
appearance
that
bespoke
talmudic
scholarship
and
prosperity
he
was
a
native
of
a
small
town
near
antomir
where
his
father
had
been
rabbi
and
was
now
a
retired
flour
merchant
having
come
to
america
in
the
seventies
he
had
always
been
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
synagogue
of
the
sons
of
antomir
in
the
days
when
i
was
a
frequenter
at
the
old
house
of
prayer
the
social
chasm
between
him
and
myself
was
so
wide
that
the
notion
of
my
being
engaged
to
a
daughter
of
his
would
have
seemed
absurd
which
by
the
way
was
one
of
the
attractions
that
his
house
now
had
for
me
good
holiday
mr
kaplan
some
of
the
other
worshipers
saluted
him
as
he
made
his
way
toward
his
pew
good
holiday
good
holiday
he
responded
with
dignified
geniality
i
could
see
that
he
was
aware
of
my
presence
but
carefully
avoided
looking
at
me
until
he
should
be
near
enough
for
me
to
greet
him
he
was
a
kindly
man
sincerely
devout
and
not
he
had
his
little
vanities
and
i
was
willing
to
humor
them
good
holiday
mr
kaplan
i
called
out
to
him
good
holiday
good
holiday
david
he
returned
amiably
here
already
ahead
of
me
that
good
just
follow
the
path
of
judaism
and
everything
will
be
all
right
how
everybody
i
asked
all
are
well
thank
god
how
fanny
now
you
talking
that
the
real
question
is
it
he
chaffed
me
with
dignity
she
well
thank
god
he
introduced
me
to
the
cantor
a
man
with
a
pale
face
and
a
skimpy
little
beard
of
a
brownish
hue
our
new
cantor
the
celebrated
jacob
goldstein
he
said
and
this
is
david
levinsky
my
intended
an
antomir
man
was
a
fine
scholar
over
there
and
still
remembers
a
lot
of
talmud
the
newly
arrived
synagogue
tenor
was
really
a
celebrated
man
in
the
antomir
section
of
russia
at
least
his
coming
had
been
conceived
as
a
sensational
feature
of
the
opening
of
the
new
synagogue
while
town
cantor
in
antomir
he
had
received
the
highest
salary
ever
paid
there
the
contract
that
had
induced
him
to
come
over
to
america
pledged
him
nearly
five
times
as
much
thus
the
new
york
sons
of
antomir
were
not
only
able
to
parade
a
famous
cantor
before
the
multitude
of
other
new
york
congregations
but
also
to
prove
to
the
people
at
home
that
they
were
the
financial
superiors
of
the
whole
town
of
their
birth
so
far
however
as
the
new
york
end
of
the
sensation
was
concerned
there
was
a
bee
in
the
honey
the
imported
cantor
was
a
tragic
disappointment
the
trouble
was
that
his
new
york
audiences
were
far
more
critical
and
exacting
than
the
people
in
antomir
and
he
was
not
up
to
their
standard
for
one
thing
many
of
the
sons
of
antomir
and
others
who
came
to
their
synagogue
to
hear
the
new
singer
people
who
had
mostly
lived
in
poverty
and
ignorance
at
home
now
had
a
piano
or
a
violin
in
the
house
with
a
son
or
a
daughter
to
play
it
and
had
become
frequenters
of
the
metropolitan
opera
house
or
the
carnegie
music
hall
for
another
the
new
york
ghetto
was
full
of
good
concerts
and
all
other
sorts
of
musical
entertainments
so
much
so
that
good
music
had
become
all
but
part
of
the
daily
life
of
the
jewish
tenement
population
for
a
third
the
audiences
of
the
imported
cantor
included
people
who
had
lived
in
much
larger
european
cities
than
antomir
in
such
places
as
warsaw
odessa
lemberg
or
vienna
for
example
where
they
had
heard
much
better
cantors
than
goldstein
then
too
life
in
new
york
had
americanized
my
modernized
their
tastes
broadened
them
out
as
a
consequence
the
methods
of
the
man
who
had
won
the
admiration
of
their
native
town
seemed
to
them
crude
droll
still
the
trustees
and
several
others
who
were
responsible
for
the
coming
of
the
singer
persisted
in
speaking
of
him
as
a
greater
tenor
than
jean
de
rezske
and
my
prospective
was
a
trustee
and
a
man
to
boot
so
he
had
compassion
for
him
in
the
old
country
when
we
meet
a
we
only
say
to
you
i
remarked
to
the
cantor
gaily
here
we
say
this
and
something
else
besides
we
ask
him
how
he
likes
america
but
i
have
not
yet
seen
it
the
cantor
returned
with
a
broad
smile
in
which
his
pug
nose
seemed
to
grow
in
size
i
told
him
the
threadbare
joke
of
american
newspaper
reporters
boarding
an
incoming
steamer
at
sandy
hook
and
asking
some
european
celebrity
how
he
likes
america
hours
before
he
has
set
foot
on
its
soil
that
what
we
call
up
kaplan
remarked
that
means
quick
does
it
the
cantor
asked
with
another
broad
smile
you
picking
up
english
rather
fast
i
jested
he
has
not
only
a
fine
voice
but
a
fine
head
too
kaplan
put
in
i
know
what
right
means
too
the
cantor
laughed
i
thought
there
was
servility
in
his
laugh
and
i
ascribed
it
to
the
lukewarm
reception
with
which
he
had
met
i
was
touched
we
talked
of
antomir
and
although
a
conversation
of
this
kind
was
nothing
new
to
me
yet
what
he
said
of
the
streets
the
bridge
the
synagogues
and
of
some
of
the
people
of
the
town
interested
me
inexpressibly
presently
the
service
was
begun
not
by
the
imported
singer
but
by
an
amateur
from
among
the
worshipers
the
service
on
a
passover
evening
not
being
considered
important
enough
to
be
conducted
by
a
professional
cantor
of
consequence
my
heart
was
all
in
antomir
in
the
good
old
antomir
of
synagogues
and
talmud
scholars
and
marriages
not
of
college
students
revolutionists
and
matildas
when
the
service
was
over
i
stepped
up
close
to
the
holy
ark
and
recited
the
prayer
for
the
dead
in
chorus
with
several
other
men
and
boys
as
i
cast
a
glance
at
my
memorial
candle
my
mother
loomed
saintly
through
its
flame
i
beheld
myself
in
her
arms
a
boy
of
four
on
our
way
to
the
synagogue
where
i
was
to
be
taught
to
parrot
the
very
words
that
i
was
now
saying
for
her
spirit
the
prayer
for
the
dead
was
at
an
end
a
good
holiday
a
merry
holiday
rang
on
all
sides
as
the
slender
crowd
streamed
chatteringly
toward
the
door
kaplan
the
cantor
and
several
other
men
clustering
together
lingered
to
bandy
reminiscences
of
antomir
interspersing
them
with
bits
of
law
chapter
ix
the
kaplans
occupied
a
large
old
house
on
henry
street
that
had
been
built
at
a
period
when
the
neighborhood
was
considered
the
best
in
the
city
while
kaplan
and
i
were
taking
off
our
overcoats
in
the
broad
carpeted
rather
dimly
lighted
hall
a
girl
appeared
at
the
head
of
a
steep
stairway
hello
dave
you
a
good
boy
she
shouted
joyously
as
she
ran
down
to
meet
me
with
coquettish
complacency
she
had
regular
features
and
her
face
wore
an
expression
of
ease
and
her
dark
eyes
were
large
and
pretty
and
altogether
she
was
rather
indeed
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
why
she
should
not
be
decidedly
pretty
but
she
was
not
perhaps
it
was
because
of
that
air
of
hers
the
air
of
one
whom
nothing
in
the
world
could
startle
or
stir
temperamentally
she
reminded
me
somewhat
of
miss
kalmanovitch
but
she
was
the
of
the
two
i
was
not
in
love
with
her
but
she
certainly
was
not
repulsive
to
me
good
holiday
dad
good
holiday
dave
she
saluted
us
in
yiddish
throwing
out
her
chest
and
squaring
her
shoulders
as
she
reached
us
she
was
born
in
new
york
and
had
graduated
at
a
public
and
english
was
the
only
language
which
she
spoke
like
one
born
to
speak
it
and
yet
her
yiddish
greeting
was
precisely
what
it
would
have
been
had
she
been
born
and
bred
in
antomir
her
good
holiday
dad
good
holiday
dave
went
straight
to
my
heart
well
i
brought
him
to
you
have
i
are
you
pleased
her
father
said
with
affectionate
grimness
in
yiddish
oh
you
a
dandy
dad
you
just
sweet
she
returned
in
english
putting
up
her
red
lips
as
if
he
were
her
baby
and
this
too
went
to
my
heart
when
her
father
had
gone
to
have
his
shoes
changed
for
slippers
and
before
her
mother
came
down
from
her
bedroom
where
she
was
apparently
dressing
for
supper
fanny
slipped
her
arm
around
me
and
i
kissed
her
lips
and
eyes
a
chuckle
rang
out
somewhere
near
by
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
back
parlor
was
mary
sister
shame
she
said
gloatingly
the
nasty
thing
fanny
exclaimed
half
gaily
half
in
anger
you
nasty
yourself
returned
mary
making
faces
at
her
sister
shut
up
or
i
knock
your
head
off
stop
quarreling
kids
i
intervened
then
addressing
myself
to
mary
can
you
spell
mary
laughed
never
mind
laughing
i
insisted
do
you
know
what
eavesdropping
means
is
it
a
nice
thing
to
do
anyhow
when
you
as
big
as
fanny
and
you
have
a
sweetheart
wo
you
let
him
kiss
you
as
i
said
this
i
took
fanny
hand
tenderly
she
has
sweethearts
already
said
fanny
she
is
running
around
with
three
boys
i
ai
mary
protested
pouting
well
three
sweethearts
means
no
sweetheart
at
all
i
remarked
fanny
and
i
went
into
the
front
parlor
a
vast
room
as
large
as
the
average
flat
in
the
modern
that
had
recently
been
completed
on
the
next
block
it
was
drearily
too
large
for
the
habits
of
the
east
side
of
my
time
depressingly
out
of
keeping
with
its
sense
of
home
it
had
lanky
furniture
and
a
heavy
bright
carpet
all
of
which
had
a
forbidding
effect
it
was
as
though
the
chairs
and
the
sofa
had
been
placed
there
not
for
use
but
for
storage
nor
was
there
enough
furniture
to
give
the
room
an
air
of
being
inhabited
the
six
pieces
and
the
losing
themselves
in
spaces
full
of
gaudy
desolation
she
awful
saucy
said
fanny
i
caught
her
in
my
arms
i
have
not
three
sweethearts
i
have
only
one
and
that
a
real
one
i
cooed
only
one
really
and
truly
she
demanded
playfully
she
gathered
me
to
her
plump
bosom
planting
a
deep
slow
sensuous
kiss
on
my
lips
i
cast
a
to
ascertain
if
mary
was
not
spying
upon
us
do
be
uneasy
fanny
whispered
she
wo
dare
we
can
kiss
all
we
want
i
thought
she
was
putting
it
in
a
rather
way
but
i
kissed
her
with
passion
all
the
same
dearest
if
you
knew
how
happy
i
am
i
murmured
are
you
really
oh
i
do
believe
you
she
jested
you
just
pretending
that
all
let
me
kiss
your
sweet
mouthie
again
she
did
and
then
breaking
away
at
the
sound
of
her
lumbering
steps
she
threw
out
her
bosom
with
an
upward
jerk
a
trick
she
had
which
i
disliked
ten
minutes
later
the
whole
family
myself
included
were
seated
around
a
large
oval
table
in
the
basement
besides
the
members
already
known
to
the
reader
there
was
mother
a
corpulent
woman
with
a
fat
diabetic
face
and
large
listless
eyes
and
fanny
brother
rubie
a
boy
with
intense
features
one
year
younger
than
mary
rubie
was
the
youngest
of
five
children
the
oldest
two
daughters
being
married
kaplan
was
in
his
while
i
wore
my
derby
everything
in
this
house
was
strictly
orthodox
and
as
as
the
american
environment
would
permit
that
there
was
not
a
trace
of
leavened
bread
in
the
house
its
place
being
taken
by
thin
flat
unleavened
matzos
and
that
the
repast
included
matzo
balls
wine
mead
and
other
accessories
of
a
passover
meal
is
a
matter
of
course
kaplan
was
wrapped
up
in
his
family
and
on
this
occasion
though
he
presided
with
conscious
dignity
he
was
in
one
of
his
best
domestic
moods
talkative
and
affectionately
facetious
the
children
were
the
real
masters
of
his
house
watching
his
wife
nag
rubie
because
he
would
not
accept
another
matzo
ball
kaplan
said
do
worry
malkah
your
matzo
balls
are
delicious
even
if
your
son
wo
do
justice
to
them
are
they
david
they
certainly
are
i
answered
what
is
more
they
have
the
genuine
antomir
taste
to
them
hear
that
fanny
kaplan
said
to
my
betrothed
you
had
better
learn
to
make
matzo
balls
exactly
like
these
he
likes
everything
that
smells
of
antomir
you
know
that
all
right
said
malkah
fanny
is
a
good
housekeeper
may
i
have
as
good
a
year
it
a
good
thing
you
say
it
her
husband
jested
else
david
might
break
the
engagement
let
him
said
fanny
with
a
jerk
of
her
bosom
and
a
theatrical
glance
at
me
i
really
do
know
how
to
make
matzo
balls
and
passover
is
nearly
over
so
there
no
time
for
mamma
to
show
me
how
to
do
it
i
do
so
next
year
her
mother
said
with
an
affectionate
smile
that
kindled
life
in
her
diabetic
eyes
the
two
of
you
will
then
have
to
pass
passover
with
us
i
accept
the
invitation
at
once
i
said
provided
you
attend
the
seder
too
remarked
kaplan
referring
to
the
elaborate
and
picturesque
ceremony
attending
the
first
two
suppers
of
the
great
festival
i
had
been
expected
to
partake
of
those
ceremonial
repasts
on
the
first
and
second
nights
of
this
passover
but
had
been
unavoidably
kept
away
from
the
city
kaplan
had
resented
it
and
even
now
as
he
spoke
of
the
next
year
seder
there
was
reproach
in
his
voice
i
will
i
will
i
said
ardently
one
must
do
business
on
a
seder
night
it
is
right
give
it
to
him
pa
fanny
cut
in
i
am
not
joking
kaplan
persisted
one
has
got
to
be
a
jew
excuse
me
david
for
speaking
like
that
but
you
re
going
to
be
as
good
as
a
son
of
mine
and
i
have
a
right
to
talk
to
you
in
this
way
why
of
course
you
have
i
answered
with
filial
docility
his
lecture
bored
me
but
it
did
me
good
too
it
was
sweet
to
hear
myself
called
as
good
as
a
son
by
this
man
of
talmudic
education
who
was
at
the
same
time
a
man
of
substance
and
of
excellent
family
the
chicken
was
served
my
intended
wife
ate
voraciously
biting
lustily
and
chewing
with
gusto
the
sight
of
it
jarred
on
me
somewhat
but
i
overruled
myself
it
all
right
i
thought
a
healthy
girl
she
make
me
a
strong
mate
and
she
bear
me
healthy
children
i
had
a
temptation
to
take
her
in
my
arms
and
kiss
her
i
am
not
in
love
with
her
and
yet
i
am
so
happy
i
thought
oh
love
essential
to
happiness
not
at
all
our
old
generation
is
right
fanny
reading
which
was
only
an
occasional
performance
was
confined
to
the
cheapest
stories
published
even
the
popular
novels
of
the
day
the
best
sellers
seemed
to
be
beyond
her
depth
her
intellectual
range
was
not
much
wider
than
that
of
her
mother
whose
literary
attainments
were
restricted
to
the
reading
of
the
yiddish
commentary
on
the
pentateuch
she
often
interrupted
me
or
her
mother
everybody
except
her
father
but
all
this
seemed
to
be
quite
natural
and
fitting
she
is
expected
to
be
a
wife
a
mother
and
a
housekeeper
i
reflected
and
that
she
will
know
how
to
be
everything
else
is
nonsense
i
do
want
to
discuss
spencer
with
her
do
i
kaplan
quoted
the
opening
words
of
a
passage
in
the
talmud
bearing
upon
piety
as
the
bulwark
of
happiness
i
took
it
up
finishing
the
passage
for
him
see
he
said
to
his
wife
i
have
told
you
he
remembers
his
talmud
pretty
well
have
i
when
a
man
has
a
good
head
he
has
a
good
head
she
returned
radiantly
rubie
went
to
a
public
school
but
he
spent
three
or
four
hours
every
afternoon
at
an
talmudic
academy
or
yeshivah
there
were
two
such
yeshivahs
on
the
east
side
and
they
were
attended
by
boys
of
the
most
orthodox
families
in
the
ghetto
i
had
never
met
such
boys
before
that
an
american
should
read
talmud
seemed
a
joke
to
me
i
could
not
take
rubie
holy
studies
seriously
as
we
now
sat
at
the
table
i
banteringly
asked
him
about
the
last
page
he
had
read
he
answered
my
question
and
at
his
father
command
he
ran
into
the
back
parlor
where
stood
two
huge
bookcases
filled
with
glittering
folios
of
the
talmud
and
other
volumes
of
holy
lore
and
came
back
with
one
containing
the
page
he
had
named
find
it
and
let
david
see
what
you
can
do
his
father
said
rubie
complied
reading
the
text
and
interpreting
it
in
yiddish
precisely
as
i
should
have
done
when
i
was
eleven
years
old
he
even
gesticulated
and
swayed
backward
and
forward
as
i
used
to
do
to
complete
the
picture
his
mother
watching
him
beamed
as
my
mother
used
to
do
when
she
watched
me
reading
at
the
preacher
synagogue
or
at
home
in
our
wretched
basement
i
was
deeply
affected
he
all
right
i
said
he
a
loafer
just
the
same
his
father
said
gaily
if
he
had
as
much
appetite
for
his
talmud
as
he
has
for
his
he
would
really
be
all
right
what
do
you
want
of
him
malkah
interceded
does
he
work
hard
enough
as
it
is
he
hardly
has
an
hour
rest
there
you
have
it
i
did
speak
respectfully
enough
of
her
son
i
beg
your
pardon
malkah
kaplan
said
facetiously
the
wedding
had
been
set
for
one
of
the
included
in
the
feast
of
tabernacles
about
six
months
later
kaplan
said
something
about
her
plans
concerning
the
event
fanny
objected
her
mother
insisted
and
it
looked
like
an
altercation
when
the
head
of
the
family
called
them
to
order
and
where
are
you
going
for
your
honeymoon
fanny
asked
mary
that
none
of
your
business
her
sister
retorted
she
stuck
up
because
she
going
to
be
married
mary
jeered
shut
your
mouth
her
father
growled
do
you
know
my
idea
of
a
honeymoon
said
i
that
is
if
it
were
possible
if
russia
did
have
that
accursed
government
of
hers
we
should
take
a
trip
to
antomir
would
that
be
lovely
said
fanny
we
would
stop
in
paris
would
we
fanny
and
her
mother
resumed
their
discussion
of
the
preparations
for
the
wedding
i
scarcely
listened
yet
i
was
thrilled
i
gazed
at
fanny
trying
to
picture
her
as
the
mother
of
my
first
child
if
a
girl
she
be
named
for
mother
of
course
i
mused
i
reflected
with
mortification
that
my
mother
name
could
not
be
left
in
its
original
form
but
would
have
to
be
americanized
and
for
the
moment
this
seemed
to
be
a
matter
of
the
gravest
concern
to
me
my
attitude
toward
fanny
and
our
prospective
marriage
was
primitive
enough
and
yet
our
engagement
had
an
ennobling
effect
on
me
i
was
in
a
lofty
mood
my
heart
sang
of
motives
higher
than
the
mere
feathering
of
my
own
nest
the
vision
of
working
for
my
wife
and
children
somehow
induced
a
yearning
for
altruism
in
a
broader
sense
while
free
from
any
vestige
of
religion
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
i
was
tingling
with
a
religious
ecstasy
that
was
based
on
a
sense
of
public
duty
the
synagogue
of
the
sons
of
antomir
seemed
to
represent
not
a
creed
but
unselfishness
i
donated
generously
to
it
also
i
subscribed
a
liberal
sum
to
an
east
side
hospital
of
which
kaplan
was
a
member
and
to
other
institutions
the
sum
i
gave
to
the
hospital
was
so
large
that
it
made
a
stir
and
a
conservative
yiddish
daily
printed
my
photograph
and
a
short
sketch
of
my
life
i
thought
of
the
promise
i
had
given
naphtali
before
leaving
antomir
to
send
him
a
ship
ticket
i
had
thought
of
it
many
times
before
but
i
had
never
even
sought
to
discover
his
whereabouts
this
time
however
i
throbbed
with
a
firm
resolution
to
get
his
address
and
in
case
he
was
poor
to
bring
him
over
and
liberally
provide
for
his
future
my
wedding
loomed
as
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
in
my
life
it
appealed
to
my
imagination
as
a
new
birth
like
my
coming
to
america
i
looked
forward
to
it
with
mixed
awe
and
bliss
three
or
four
months
later
however
something
happened
that
played
havoc
with
that
feeling
book
xii
miss
tevkin
chapter
i
on
a
saturday
morning
in
august
i
took
a
train
for
tannersville
catskill
mountains
where
the
kaplan
family
had
a
cottage
i
was
to
stay
with
them
over
sunday
i
had
been
expected
to
be
there
the
day
before
but
had
been
detained
august
being
part
of
our
busiest
season
while
in
the
it
came
over
me
that
from
kaplan
point
of
view
my
journey
was
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
sabbath
and
that
it
was
sure
to
make
things
awkward
whether
my
riding
on
saturday
would
actually
offend
his
religious
sensibilities
or
not
for
in
america
one
gets
used
to
seeing
such
sins
committed
even
by
the
faithful
it
was
certain
to
offend
his
sense
of
the
respect
i
owed
him
and
so
to
avoid
a
sullen
reception
i
decided
to
stop
overnight
in
another
catskill
town
and
not
to
make
my
appearance
at
tannersville
until
the
following
day
the
insignificant
change
was
pregnant
with
momentous
results
it
was
when
i
alighted
from
the
train
amid
a
hubbub
of
gay
voices
women
and
children
were
greeting
their
husbands
and
fathers
who
had
come
from
the
city
to
join
them
for
the
i
had
never
been
to
the
mountains
before
nor
practically
ever
taken
a
day
vacation
it
was
so
full
of
ozone
so
full
of
balm
it
was
almost
overpowering
i
was
inhaling
it
in
deep
intoxicating
gulps
it
gave
me
a
pleasure
so
keen
it
seemed
to
verge
on
pain
it
was
so
unlike
the
air
i
had
left
in
the
sweltering
city
that
the
place
seemed
to
belong
to
another
planet
i
stopped
at
the
rigi
kulm
house
there
were
several
other
hotels
or
in
the
village
and
all
of
them
except
one
were
occupied
by
our
people
the
rigi
kulm
being
the
largest
and
most
expensive
hostelry
in
the
neighborhood
lt
was
crowded
and
i
had
to
content
myself
with
in
one
of
the
cottages
in
which
the
hired
rooms
for
his
overflow
business
taking
my
meals
in
the
hotel
the
rigi
kulm
stood
at
the
end
of
the
village
and
my
cottage
was
across
the
main
country
road
from
it
both
were
on
high
ground
viewed
from
the
veranda
of
the
hotel
the
village
lay
to
the
right
and
the
open
country
a
fascinating
landscape
of
meadowland
timbered
hills
and
a
brook
that
lost
itself
in
a
grove
to
the
left
the
mountains
rose
in
two
ranges
one
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
one
in
the
rear
the
bulk
of
the
boarders
at
the
rigi
kulm
was
made
up
of
families
of
clothiers
furriers
jewelers
men
men
physicians
dentists
lawyers
in
most
cases
people
who
had
blossomed
out
into
nabobs
in
the
course
of
the
last
few
years
the
crowd
was
ablaze
with
diamonds
painted
cheeks
and
silks
it
was
a
babel
of
blatant
a
miniature
of
the
parvenu
smugness
that
had
spread
like
over
the
country
after
a
period
of
need
and
low
spirits
in
addition
to
families
who
were
there
for
the
whole
season
that
is
from
the
fourth
of
july
to
the
first
monday
in
october
the
hotel
contained
a
considerable
number
of
single
young
people
of
both
sexes
salesmen
stenographers
bookkeepers
librarians
who
came
for
a
fortnight
vacation
these
were
known
as
they
occupied
tiny
rooms
usually
two
girls
or
two
men
in
a
room
each
of
these
girls
had
a
large
supply
of
dresses
and
of
the
latest
style
and
altogether
the
two
weeks
vacation
ate
up
in
many
cases
the
savings
of
months
to
be
sure
the
of
the
gentle
sex
were
not
the
only
marriageable
young
women
in
the
place
they
had
a
number
of
heiresses
to
compete
with
i
was
too
conspicuous
a
figure
in
the
needle
industries
for
my
name
to
be
unknown
to
the
guests
of
a
hotel
like
the
rigi
kulm
house
moreover
several
of
the
people
i
found
there
were
my
personal
acquaintances
one
of
these
was
nodelman
cousin
kalch
or
auntie
yetta
the
gaunt
childless
woman
of
the
solemn
countenance
and
the
gay
disposition
of
the
huge
gold
teeth
and
the
fingers
heavily
laden
with
diamonds
i
had
not
seen
her
for
months
as
the
lessee
of
the
hotel
marched
me
into
his
great
she
rushed
out
to
me
her
teeth
aglitter
with
hospitality
and
made
me
take
a
seat
at
a
table
which
she
shared
with
her
husband
the
man
and
two
women
i
could
see
that
she
had
not
heard
of
my
engagement
and
to
avoid
awkward
interrogations
concerning
the
whereabouts
of
my
fiancée
i
omitted
to
announce
it
i
know
what
you
have
come
here
for
she
said
archly
you
fool
auntie
yetta
but
you
have
come
to
the
right
place
i
can
tell
you
that
a
larger
assortment
of
beautiful
young
ladies
you
never
saw
levinsky
and
they
educated
too
if
you
do
find
your
predestined
one
here
you
never
find
her
what
do
you
say
mr
rivesman
she
addressed
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
who
stood
by
and
whom
i
had
known
for
many
years
i
agree
with
you
thoroughly
kalch
he
answered
smilingly
but
levinsky
tells
me
he
can
stay
only
one
day
with
us
plenty
of
time
for
a
smart
man
to
pick
a
girl
in
a
place
like
this
besides
you
just
tell
him
that
you
have
a
lot
of
fine
educated
young
ladies
rivesman
he
is
an
educated
gentleman
levinsky
is
and
if
he
knows
the
kind
of
boarders
you
have
stay
longer
i
know
levinsky
is
an
educated
man
rivesman
answered
as
for
our
boarders
they
all
fine
superfine
so
you
got
to
find
your
predestined
one
here
she
resumed
turning
to
me
again
otherwise
you
ca
leave
this
place
see
but
suppose
i
have
found
her
already
elsewhere
you
had
no
business
to
anyhow
if
she
does
know
enough
to
hold
you
tight
and
you
are
here
to
spend
a
with
other
girls
she
does
not
deserve
to
have
you
but
i
am
not
spending
it
with
other
girls
what
else
did
you
come
here
for
and
she
screwed
up
of
her
face
into
a
wink
so
grotesque
that
i
could
not
help
bursting
into
laughter
about
an
hour
after
lunch
i
sat
in
a
on
the
front
porch
gazing
at
the
landscape
the
sky
was
a
blue
so
subtle
and
so
noble
that
it
seemed
as
though
i
had
never
seen
such
a
sky
before
this
is
just
the
kind
of
place
for
god
to
live
in
i
mused
whereupon
i
decided
that
this
was
what
was
meant
by
the
word
heaven
whereas
the
blue
overhanging
the
city
was
a
mere
sky
the
village
was
full
of
blinding
scorching
sunshine
yet
the
air
was
entrancingly
ref
reshing
the
veranda
was
almost
deserted
most
of
the
women
being
in
their
rooms
gossiping
or
dressing
for
the
arrival
of
their
husbands
fathers
sweethearts
or
possible
sweethearts
birds
were
embroidering
the
silence
of
the
hour
with
a
silvery
whisper
that
spoke
of
rest
and
the
slender
brook
to
the
left
of
me
was
droning
like
a
bee
everything
was
charged
with
peace
and
soothing
mystery
a
feeling
of
lassitude
descended
upon
me
i
was
too
lazy
even
to
think
but
the
landscape
was
continually
forcing
images
on
my
mind
a
hollow
in
the
slope
of
one
of
the
mountains
in
front
of
me
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
huge
spoon
half
of
it
was
dark
while
the
other
half
was
full
of
golden
light
it
seemed
as
though
it
was
the
sun
favorite
spot
the
enchanted
spot
i
named
it
i
tried
to
imagine
that
hollow
at
night
i
visioned
a
company
of
ghosts
tiptoeing
their
way
to
it
and
stealing
a
night
lodging
in
the
spoon
and
later
at
the
approach
of
dawn
behold
the
ghosts
were
fleeing
to
the
woods
near
by
rising
behind
that
mountain
was
the
timbered
peak
of
another
one
it
looked
like
the
fur
cap
of
a
monster
and
i
wondered
what
that
monster
was
thinking
of
when
i
gazed
at
the
mountain
directly
opposite
the
hotel
i
had
a
feeling
of
disappointment
i
knew
that
it
was
very
high
that
it
took
hours
to
climb
it
but
i
failed
to
realize
it
it
was
seemingly
quite
low
and
commonplace
darkling
at
the
foot
of
it
was
what
looked
like
a
moat
choked
with
underbrush
and
weeds
the
spot
was
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
hotel
yet
it
seemed
to
be
only
a
minute
walk
from
me
but
then
a
bird
that
was
flying
over
that
moat
at
the
moment
winging
its
way
straight
across
it
was
apparently
making
no
progress
was
this
region
exempt
from
the
laws
of
space
and
distance
the
bewitching
azure
of
the
sky
and
the
divine
taste
of
the
air
seemed
to
bear
out
a
feeling
that
it
was
exempt
from
any
law
of
nature
with
which
i
was
familiar
the
directly
opposite
the
hotel
looked
weird
now
was
it
peopled
with
liliputians
another
bird
made
itself
heard
somewhere
in
the
underbrush
flanking
the
brook
it
was
saying
something
in
querulous
accents
i
knew
nothing
of
birds
and
the
song
or
call
of
this
one
sounded
so
queer
to
me
that
i
was
almost
frightened
all
of
which
tended
to
enhance
the
uncanny
majesty
of
the
whole
landscape
presently
i
heard
kalch
calling
to
me
she
was
coming
along
the
veranda
resplendent
in
a
purple
dress
a
huge
diamond
breastpin
and
huge
diamond
earrings
all
alone
all
alone
she
exclaimed
as
she
paused
interlocking
her
bediamonded
fingers
in
a
posture
of
mock
amazement
all
alone
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
to
sit
moping
out
here
when
there
are
so
many
pretty
young
ladies
around
come
along
i
find
you
one
or
two
as
sweet
as
sugar
kissing
the
tips
of
her
fingers
thank
you
kalch
but
i
like
it
here
kalch
auntie
yetta
you
mean
and
the
lumps
of
gold
in
her
mouth
glinted
very
well
auntie
yetta
that
better
wait
wait
i
come
back
she
vanished
presently
she
returned
and
grabbing
me
by
an
arm
stood
me
up
and
convoyed
me
around
the
hotel
to
a
secluded
spot
on
the
rear
porch
where
four
girls
were
chatting
quietly
perhaps
you
find
your
predestined
one
among
these
she
said
but
i
have
found
her
already
i
protested
with
annoyance
she
took
no
heed
of
my
words
after
introducing
me
to
two
of
the
girls
and
causing
them
to
introduce
me
to
the
other
two
she
said
and
now
go
for
him
young
ladies
you
know
who
levinsky
is
do
you
it
is
some
kike
it
david
levinsky
the
do
miss
your
chance
try
to
catch
him
i
ready
said
miss
lazar
a
pretty
brunette
in
white
she
all
right
declared
auntie
yetta
her
tongue
cuts
like
a
knife
that
has
just
been
sharpened
but
she
as
good
as
gold
am
i
i
ai
so
sure
about
it
you
had
better
look
out
levinsky
the
brunette
in
white
warned
me
why
that
just
makes
it
interesting
i
returned
danger
is
tempting
you
know
how
are
you
going
to
catch
me
with
a
net
or
a
trap
auntie
yetta
interrupted
us
i
off
she
said
rising
to
go
i
can
safely
leave
you
in
their
hands
levinsky
they
take
care
of
you
she
said
with
a
wink
as
she
departed
you
have
answered
my
question
i
said
to
miss
lazar
what
was
it
she
has
a
poor
memory
do
you
know
laughed
a
girl
in
a
yellow
she
was
not
pretty
but
she
had
winning
blue
eyes
and
her
yellow
waist
became
her
levinsky
wants
to
know
if
you
going
to
catch
him
with
a
net
or
with
a
trap
and
how
about
yourself
i
demanded
what
sort
of
tools
have
you
oh
i
do
think
i
have
a
chance
with
a
big
fish
like
yourself
she
replied
her
companions
laughed
well
that
only
her
way
of
fishing
said
miss
lazar
she
tells
every
fellow
she
has
no
chance
with
him
that
her
way
of
getting
started
you
better
look
out
mr
levinsky
and
her
way
is
to
put
on
airs
and
look
as
if
she
could
have
anybody
she
wanted
retorted
the
one
of
the
blue
eyes
stop
girls
said
a
third
who
was
also
interesting
if
we
are
going
to
give
away
one
another
secrets
there
be
no
chance
for
any
of
us
i
could
see
that
their
thrusts
contained
more
fact
than
fiction
and
more
venom
than
gaiety
but
it
was
all
laughed
off
and
everybody
seemed
to
be
on
the
best
of
terms
with
everybody
else
i
looked
at
this
bevy
of
girls
each
attractive
in
her
way
and
i
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
was
not
in
the
least
tempted
to
flirt
with
them
i
am
a
sedate
man
now
and
all
because
i
am
engaged
i
congratulated
myself
there
is
only
one
woman
in
the
world
for
me
and
that
is
fanny
my
fanny
the
girl
that
is
going
to
be
my
wife
in
a
few
weeks
from
directly
in
front
of
us
and
only
a
few
yards
off
was
a
it
was
unoccupied
at
first
but
presently
there
appeared
two
girls
with
rackets
and
balls
and
they
started
to
play
one
of
these
arrested
my
attention
violently
as
it
were
i
thought
her
strikingly
interesting
and
pretty
i
could
not
help
gazing
at
her
in
spite
of
the
eyes
that
were
watching
me
and
she
was
growing
on
me
rapidly
it
seemed
as
though
absolutely
everything
about
her
made
a
strong
appeal
to
me
she
was
tall
and
stately
with
a
fine
pink
complexion
and
an
effective
mass
of
chestnut
hair
i
found
that
her
face
attested
intellectual
dignity
and
a
kindly
disposition
i
liked
her
white
strong
teeth
i
liked
the
way
she
closed
her
lips
and
i
liked
the
way
she
opened
them
into
a
smile
the
way
she
ran
to
meet
the
ball
and
the
way
she
betrayed
disappointment
when
she
missed
it
i
still
seemed
to
be
congratulating
myself
upon
my
indifference
to
women
other
than
the
one
who
was
soon
to
bear
my
name
when
i
became
conscious
of
a
mighty
interest
in
this
girl
i
said
to
myself
that
she
looked
refined
from
head
to
foot
and
that
her
movements
had
a
peculiar
rhythm
that
was
irresistible
physically
her
cast
of
features
was
scarcely
prettier
than
fanny
for
my
betrothed
was
really
a
girl
but
spiritually
there
was
a
world
of
difference
between
their
faces
the
difference
between
a
greek
statue
and
one
of
those
lay
figures
that
one
used
to
see
in
front
of
the
other
was
a
short
girl
with
a
long
face
i
reflected
that
if
she
were
a
little
taller
or
her
face
were
not
so
long
she
might
not
be
uninteresting
and
that
by
contrast
with
her
companion
she
looked
homelier
than
she
actually
was
miss
lazar
watched
me
closely
playing
tennis
is
one
way
of
fishing
for
fellows
she
remarked
so
the
racket
is
really
a
in
disguise
is
it
i
returned
but
where
are
the
fellows
are
you
one
no
oh
these
two
girls
go
in
for
highbrow
fellows
said
a
young
woman
who
had
hitherto
contented
herself
with
smiling
and
laughing
they
highbrow
themselves
do
they
use
big
words
i
asked
well
they
well
read
i
say
that
for
them
observed
miss
lazar
with
a
fine
display
of
fairness
college
girls
only
one
of
them
which
guess
the
tall
one
i
thought
she
be
the
one
you
pick
you
have
to
guess
again
what
made
you
think
i
pick
her
for
a
college
girl
you
have
to
guess
that
too
well
she
is
an
educated
girl
all
the
same
she
volunteered
the
further
information
that
the
tall
girl
father
was
a
writer
and
as
though
anxious
lest
i
should
take
him
too
seriously
she
hastened
to
add
he
does
write
english
though
it
jewish
or
hebrew
or
something
what
his
name
i
asked
tevkin
she
answered
under
her
breath
the
name
sounded
remotely
familiar
to
me
had
i
seen
it
in
some
yiddish
paper
had
i
heard
it
somewhere
the
intellectual
east
side
was
practically
a
foreign
country
to
me
and
i
was
proud
of
the
fact
i
knew
something
of
its
orthodox
talmudists
but
scarcely
anything
of
its
modern
men
of
letters
poets
thinkers
humorists
whether
they
wrote
in
yiddish
in
hebrew
in
russian
or
in
english
if
i
took
an
occasional
look
at
the
socialist
yiddish
daily
it
was
chiefly
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
union
otherwise
i
regarded
everything
that
was
written
for
the
east
side
with
contempt
and
east
side
writer
was
synonymous
with
greenhorn
and
tramp
worse
than
that
it
was
identified
in
my
mind
with
socialism
anarchism
and
it
was
something
sinister
absurd
and
uncouth
but
miss
tevkin
was
a
beautiful
girl
nevertheless
so
i
pitied
her
for
being
the
daughter
of
an
east
side
writer
the
tennis
game
did
not
last
long
miss
tevkin
and
her
companion
soon
went
indoors
i
went
out
for
a
stroll
by
myself
i
was
thinking
of
my
journey
to
tannersville
the
next
morning
the
enforced
loss
of
time
chafed
me
of
the
strong
impression
which
the
tall
girl
had
produced
on
me
not
a
trace
seemed
to
have
been
left
she
bothered
me
no
more
than
any
other
pretty
girl
i
might
have
recently
come
across
young
women
with
strikingly
interesting
faces
and
figures
were
not
rare
in
new
york
i
had
not
been
walking
five
minutes
when
i
impatiently
returned
to
the
hotel
to
consult
the
chapter
ii
i
was
chatting
with
rivesman
the
lessee
of
the
hotel
across
the
counter
that
separated
part
of
his
office
from
the
lobby
as
i
have
said
i
had
known
him
for
many
years
he
had
formerly
been
in
the
insurance
business
and
he
had
at
one
time
acted
as
my
insurance
broker
he
was
a
talmudist
and
well
versed
in
modern
hebrew
literature
to
boot
he
advised
me
concerning
trains
to
tannersville
and
then
we
passed
to
the
hotel
business
and
mutual
acquaintances
presently
miss
tevkin
apparently
on
her
way
from
her
room
paused
at
the
counter
by
my
side
to
leave
her
key
she
was
dressed
for
dinner
although
it
was
not
yet
half
past
and
the
great
repast
for
which
train
after
train
was
bringing
husbands
and
other
weekenders
to
the
mountains
was
usually
a
very
late
affair
the
dress
she
now
wore
was
a
modest
gown
of
navy
blue
trimmed
with
lace
the
change
of
attire
seemed
to
have
produced
a
partial
change
in
her
identity
she
was
interesting
in
a
new
way
i
thought
going
to
enjoy
the
fresh
air
rivesman
asked
her
gallantly
she
answered
pleasantly
it
glorious
outside
and
she
vanished
pretty
girl
i
remarked
and
a
one
too
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
one
of
your
guests
i
suppose
i
said
with
studied
indifference
yes
she
is
a
stenographer
whereupon
he
named
a
lawyer
a
man
prominent
in
the
affairs
of
the
jewish
community
as
her
employer
it
was
an
admirer
of
her
father
who
got
the
job
for
her
from
what
followed
i
learned
that
miss
tevkin
father
had
once
been
a
celebrated
hebrew
poet
and
that
he
was
no
other
than
the
hero
of
the
romance
of
which
naphtali
had
told
me
a
few
months
before
i
left
my
native
place
to
go
to
america
and
that
her
mother
was
the
heroine
of
that
romance
in
other
words
her
mother
was
the
once
celebrated
beauty
the
daughter
of
the
famous
hebrew
writer
long
since
deceased
doctor
rachaeless
of
odessa
it
was
her
father
then
who
wrote
those
i
exclaimed
excitedly
and
it
was
about
her
mother
that
he
wrote
them
somebody
told
me
on
the
veranda
that
her
name
was
miss
tevkin
i
did
think
the
name
sounded
familiar
but
i
could
not
locate
it
the
discovery
stirred
me
inordinately
i
was
palpitating
with
reminiscent
interest
and
with
a
novel
interest
in
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
just
stood
by
my
side
at
my
request
rivesman
followed
by
myself
sought
her
out
on
the
front
porch
and
introduced
me
to
her
as
a
great
admirer
of
your
father
poetry
seated
beside
her
was
a
man
with
a
lone
wisp
of
hair
directly
over
his
forehead
whom
the
introduced
as
shapiro
a
counselor
and
who
by
his
manner
of
greeting
me
showed
that
he
was
fully
aware
of
my
financial
standing
the
old
romance
of
the
hebrew
poet
and
his
present
wife
and
more
especially
the
fact
that
i
had
been
thrilled
by
it
in
antomir
threw
a
halo
of
ineffable
fascination
around
their
beautiful
daughter
so
you
are
a
daughter
of
the
great
hebrew
poet
i
said
in
english
it
awfully
kind
of
you
to
speak
like
that
she
returned
levinsky
is
known
for
his
literary
tastes
you
know
shapiro
put
in
i
wish
i
deserved
the
compliment
i
rejoined
unfortunately
i
do
i
am
glad
i
find
time
to
read
the
newspapers
the
newspapers
are
life
observed
miss
tevkin
and
life
is
the
source
of
literature
or
should
be
should
be
shapiro
mocked
her
fondly
is
that
a
dig
at
the
popular
novels
and
in
an
aside
to
me
miss
tevkin
has
no
use
for
them
you
know
she
smiled
still
worshiping
at
the
shrine
of
ibsen
he
asked
her
more
than
ever
she
replied
gaily
i
admire
your
loyalty
though
i
regret
to
say
that
i
am
still
unable
to
share
your
taste
it
is
a
matter
of
taste
she
returned
it
depends
on
what
one
is
looking
for
in
a
play
or
a
novel
she
smiled
with
the
air
of
one
abstaining
from
a
fruitless
discussion
she
a
i
said
to
myself
women
of
this
kind
are
usually
doomed
to
be
old
maids
and
yet
she
drew
me
with
a
magnetic
force
that
seemed
to
be
beyond
my
power
of
resistance
it
was
evident
that
she
enjoyed
the
discussion
and
the
fact
that
it
was
merely
a
pretext
for
the
lawyer
to
feast
his
eyes
on
her
i
wondered
why
a
man
with
a
lone
tuft
of
hair
did
not
repel
her
a
younger
brother
of
shapiro
a
broker
joined
us
he
also
was
but
his
baldness
formed
a
smaller
patch
than
the
the
two
brothers
did
most
of
the
talking
and
among
other
things
they
informed
miss
tevkin
and
myself
that
they
were
graduates
of
the
city
college
with
a
great
display
of
reading
and
repeatedly
interrupting
each
other
they
took
up
the
cudgels
for
the
good
old
school
i
soon
discovered
however
that
their
range
was
limited
to
a
small
number
of
authors
whose
names
they
uttered
with
great
gusto
and
to
whom
they
returned
again
and
again
these
were
victor
hugo
dumas
dickens
thackeray
george
eliot
coleridge
edgar
poe
and
one
or
two
others
if
the
lawyer
added
a
new
name
like
walter
pater
to
his
list
the
man
would
hasten
to
trot
out
de
quincey
for
example
for
the
rest
they
would
parade
a
whole
array
of
writers
rather
than
refer
to
any
one
of
them
in
particular
the
more
they
fulminated
and
fumed
and
bullied
miss
tevkin
the
firmer
grew
my
conviction
that
they
had
scarcely
read
the
books
for
which
they
seemed
to
be
ready
to
lay
down
their
lives
miss
tevkin
however
took
them
seriously
she
followed
them
with
the
air
of
a
good
girl
listening
to
a
lecture
by
her
mother
or
teacher
i
do
agree
with
you
at
all
she
would
say
weakly
from
time
to
time
and
resume
listening
with
charming
resignation
the
noise
made
by
the
two
brothers
attracted
several
other
boarders
one
of
these
was
a
man
of
who
spoke
remarkably
good
english
with
a
very
bad
accent
far
worse
than
mine
that
he
was
a
talmudic
scholar
was
written
all
over
his
face
by
profession
he
was
a
photographer
his
name
was
mendelson
he
took
a
hand
in
our
discussion
and
it
at
once
became
apparent
that
he
had
read
more
and
knew
more
than
the
brothers
he
was
overflowing
with
withering
sarcasm
and
easily
sneered
them
into
silence
miss
tevkin
was
happy
the
slovenly
boarder
proved
to
be
one
of
those
people
who
know
what
they
do
not
want
rather
than
what
they
do
and
so
he
proceeded
in
a
spirit
of
chivalrous
banter
to
make
game
of
her
literary
gods
as
well
you
do
really
mean
to
tell
us
that
you
enjoy
an
ibsen
play
he
demanded
why
you
are
too
full
of
life
for
that
but
that
just
what
the
ibsen
plays
are
full
of
life
she
answered
if
you
bored
by
them
it
because
you
probably
looking
for
stories
for
but
art
is
something
more
significant
than
that
there
is
moral
force
and
beauty
in
ibsen
which
one
misses
in
the
old
masters
that
exactly
what
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
or
the
rabbis
are
always
talking
about
moral
force
moral
beauty
and
moral
mendelson
retorted
the
man
uttered
a
chuckle
would
you
turn
the
theater
into
a
church
or
a
reform
synagogue
the
photographer
continued
people
go
to
see
a
play
because
they
want
to
enjoy
themselves
not
because
they
feel
that
their
morals
need
darning
but
in
good
literature
the
moral
is
not
preached
as
a
sermon
miss
tevkin
replied
it
naturally
follows
from
the
life
it
presents
anyhow
the
other
kind
of
literature
is
mere
froth
you
read
page
after
page
and
there
does
seem
to
be
any
substance
to
it
she
said
it
plaintively
as
though
apologizing
for
holding
views
of
this
kind
is
that
the
way
you
feel
about
thackeray
and
dickens
too
i
ventured
i
do
she
answered
in
the
same
doleful
tone
she
went
on
to
develop
her
argument
we
did
not
interrupt
her
the
two
brothers
the
photographer
and
myself
listening
to
her
with
admiring
glances
that
had
more
to
do
with
her
beautiful
face
and
the
music
of
her
soft
girlish
voice
than
with
what
she
was
saying
there
was
a
congealed
sneer
on
the
photographer
face
as
he
followed
her
plea
but
it
was
full
of
the
magic
of
her
presence
you
a
silly
child
his
countenance
seemed
to
say
but
i
could
eat
you
all
the
same
she
dwelt
on
the
virtues
of
ibsen
strindberg
knut
hamsen
hauptmann
and
a
number
of
others
mostly
names
i
did
not
recollect
ever
having
heard
before
and
she
often
used
the
word
decadent
which
she
pronounced
in
the
french
way
and
which
i
did
not
then
understand
now
and
then
she
would
quote
some
critic
or
some
remark
heard
from
a
friend
or
from
her
father
and
once
she
dwelt
on
an
argument
of
her
oldest
brother
who
seemed
to
be
well
versed
in
russian
literature
and
to
have
opinions
on
literature
in
general
she
spoke
with
an
fluency
with
a
charming
gift
of
language
words
came
readily
pleasantly
from
her
pretty
lips
it
was
evident
too
that
she
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
many
authors
whose
praises
she
was
sounding
yet
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
she
had
not
much
to
say
the
opinions
she
voiced
were
manifestly
not
her
own
as
though
she
was
reciting
a
lesson
and
i
was
glad
of
it
she
merely
a
girl
after
all
i
thought
fondly
the
sweetest
thing
i
ever
knew
and
her
father
is
the
man
who
wrote
those
and
her
mother
is
the
celebrated
beauty
with
whom
he
was
in
love
whether
the
views
she
set
forth
were
her
own
or
somebody
else
i
could
see
that
she
relished
uttering
them
also
that
she
relished
the
euphony
and
felicity
of
her
phrasing
which
was
certainly
her
own
whether
she
spoke
from
conviction
or
not
one
thing
seemed
indisputable
the
atmosphere
surrounding
the
books
and
authors
she
named
had
a
genuine
fascination
for
her
there
was
a
naive
sincerity
in
her
rhetoric
and
her
delivery
and
gestures
had
a
rhythm
that
seemed
to
be
akin
to
the
rhythm
of
her
movements
in
the
miss
lazar
passed
by
us
giving
me
a
smiling
look
which
seemed
to
say
i
knew
you
would
sooner
or
later
be
in
her
company
i
felt
myself
blushing
i
be
in
tannersville
and
all
this
nonsense
will
be
over
i
said
to
myself
the
short
girl
with
whom
miss
tevkin
had
played
tennis
emerged
from
the
lobby
door
and
was
introduced
to
me
as
miss
siegel
as
i
soon
gathered
from
a
bit
of
pleasantry
by
the
lawyer
she
was
a
at
miss
tevkin
suggestion
we
all
went
to
see
the
crowd
waiting
for
the
last
husband
train
as
we
rose
to
go
i
made
a
point
of
asking
miss
tevkin
for
the
name
of
the
best
ibsen
play
my
object
being
to
be
by
her
side
on
our
walk
down
to
the
village
the
photographer
hastened
to
answer
my
question
thus
occupying
the
place
on
the
other
side
of
her
we
were
crossing
the
sloping
lawn
miss
tevkin
on
a
narrow
flagged
walk
while
we
were
trotting
along
through
the
grass
on
either
side
of
her
with
the
other
three
of
our
group
bringing
up
the
rear
presently
as
we
reached
the
main
sidewalk
we
were
held
up
by
auntie
yetta
who
was
apparently
returning
from
one
of
the
cottages
across
the
road
is
this
the
one
you
are
after
she
demanded
of
me
with
a
wink
in
the
direction
of
miss
tevkin
and
looking
her
over
you
do
know
a
good
thing
when
you
see
it
then
to
her
hold
on
to
him
young
lady
hold
on
tight
levinsky
is
said
to
be
worth
a
million
you
know
she
always
joking
i
said
awkwardly
as
we
resumed
our
walk
miss
tevkin
made
no
answer
but
i
felt
that
auntie
yetta
joke
had
made
a
disagreeable
impression
on
her
i
sought
to
efface
it
by
a
humorous
sketch
of
auntie
yetta
and
seemed
to
be
successful
the
village
was
astir
the
great
husband
train
the
last
and
longest
of
the
day
was
due
in
about
ten
minutes
groups
of
women
and
children
in
gala
dress
were
emerging
from
the
various
feeding
the
main
human
stream
some
boarders
were
out
to
meet
the
train
others
were
on
their
way
to
the
for
letters
a
sunset
of
pale
gold
hung
broodingly
over
the
mountains
miss
tevkin
voice
seemed
to
have
something
to
do
with
it
presently
we
reached
the
crowd
at
the
station
the
train
was
late
the
children
were
getting
restless
at
last
it
arrived
the
first
of
two
sections
with
a
few
minutes
headway
between
them
there
was
a
jam
and
a
babel
of
voices
interminable
strings
of
passengers
begrimed
their
eyes
searching
the
throng
came
dribbling
out
of
the
cars
with
tantalizing
slowness
men
in
livery
caps
were
chanting
the
names
of
their
respective
passengers
were
shouting
the
pet
names
of
their
wives
or
children
women
and
children
were
calling
to
their
newly
arrived
husbands
and
fathers
some
gaily
others
shrieking
as
though
the
train
were
on
fire
there
were
a
large
number
of
handsome
women
in
expensive
dresses
and
diamonds
and
some
of
these
were
being
kissed
by
puny
but
men
they
married
them
for
their
money
i
said
to
myself
an
of
my
acquaintance
a
man
with
the
face
of
a
squirrel
swooped
down
upon
a
large
young
matron
of
dazzling
animal
beauty
who
had
come
in
an
automobile
he
introduced
me
to
her
with
a
beaming
air
of
triumph
i
can
afford
a
machine
and
a
beautiful
wife
his
radiant
seemed
to
say
he
was
parading
the
fact
that
this
tempting
female
had
married
him
in
spite
of
his
ugliness
he
was
mutely
boasting
as
much
of
his
own
homeliness
as
of
her
coarse
beauty
prosperity
was
picking
the
cream
of
the
bride
market
for
her
favorite
sons
i
thought
of
lenox
avenue
a
great
broad
thoroughfare
that
had
almost
suddenly
begun
to
swarm
with
and
flashily
gowned
brides
of
ghetto
upstarts
like
a
meadow
bursting
into
bloom
in
spring
and
how
about
your
own
case
a
voice
retorted
within
me
could
you
get
a
girl
like
fanny
if
it
were
not
for
your
money
ah
but
i
a
chap
myself
and
not
as
ignorant
as
most
of
the
other
fellows
who
have
succeeded
i
answered
inwardly
yes
and
i
am
entitled
to
a
better
girl
than
fanny
too
and
i
became
conscious
of
miss
tevkin
presence
by
my
side
conversation
with
the
poet
daughter
was
practically
monopolized
by
the
misanthropic
photographer
i
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
dislodge
him
i
was
determined
to
break
into
the
conversation
and
to
try
to
eclipse
him
with
a
heart
i
began
what
an
array
of
beautiful
women
present
company
with
a
bow
to
miss
tevkin
and
her
chum
not
excepted
of
course
far
from
it
the
two
girls
smiled
why
why
whence
this
sudden
fit
of
gallantry
asked
the
photographer
his
sneer
and
the
rasping
yiddish
enunciation
with
which
he
spoke
english
filling
me
with
hate
come
mendelson
i
answered
it
about
time
you
cast
off
your
grouch
look
the
sky
is
so
beautiful
the
mountains
so
majestic
cheer
up
old
man
the
man
burst
into
a
laugh
the
two
girls
smiled
looking
me
over
curiously
i
hastened
to
follow
up
my
advantage
one
does
get
into
a
peculiar
mood
on
an
evening
like
this
i
pursued
the
air
is
so
divine
and
the
people
are
so
happy
that
what
we
all
come
to
the
mountains
for
the
photographer
retorted
ignoring
his
remark
i
resumed
it
may
seem
a
contradiction
of
terms
but
these
family
reunions
these
shouts
of
welcome
are
so
thrilling
it
makes
one
feel
as
if
there
was
something
pathetic
in
them
pathetic
the
man
asked
in
surprise
levinsky
is
in
a
pathetic
mood
do
you
know
the
photographer
cut
in
yes
pathetic
i
defied
him
but
pathos
has
nothing
to
do
with
grouch
has
it
i
asked
addressing
myself
to
the
girls
why
no
miss
siegel
replied
with
a
perfunctory
smile
still
i
should
rather
see
people
meet
than
part
it
heartbreaking
to
watch
a
train
move
out
of
a
station
with
those
white
handkerchiefs
waving
and
getting
smaller
smaller
oh
those
handkerchiefs
it
was
practically
the
first
remark
i
had
heard
from
her
it
produced
a
stronger
impression
on
my
mind
than
all
miss
tevkin
had
said
nevertheless
i
felt
that
i
should
much
rather
listen
to
miss
tevkin
of
course
of
course
i
said
is
a
very
touching
scene
to
witness
but
still
when
people
meet
again
after
a
considerable
separation
it
also
touching
do
you
think
it
is
yes
i
know
what
you
mean
miss
siegel
assented
somewhat
aloofly
people
cry
for
joy
miss
tevkin
put
in
yes
but
they
cry
all
the
same
there
are
tears
i
urged
i
had
no
idea
you
were
such
a
levinsky
the
photographer
said
perhaps
you
feel
better
when
you
had
dinner
but
i
thought
you
said
this
weather
made
you
happy
it
simply
means
that
at
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
we
jews
are
a
sad
people
miss
tevkin
interceded
there
is
a
broad
streak
of
tragedy
in
our
psychology
it
the
result
of
many
centuries
of
persecution
and
homelessness
gentiles
take
life
more
easily
than
we
do
my
father
has
a
beautiful
poem
on
the
theme
but
then
the
russians
are
even
more
melancholy
than
we
are
russian
literature
is
full
of
it
my
oldest
brother
who
is
a
great
stickler
for
everything
russian
is
always
speaking
about
it
always
referring
to
her
papa
and
her
brother
i
thought
what
a
sweet
child
presently
she
and
her
chum
were
hailed
by
a
group
of
young
men
and
women
and
excusing
themselves
to
us
they
ran
over
to
join
them
i
felt
like
a
man
sipping
at
a
glass
of
wine
when
the
glass
is
suddenly
seized
from
his
hand
some
time
later
i
sat
on
a
cane
chair
amid
in
front
of
the
rigi
kulm
inhaling
the
scented
evening
air
and
gazing
down
the
sloping
side
of
the
lawn
women
and
girls
were
returning
from
the
many
of
them
with
letters
in
their
hands
some
of
these
were
so
impatient
to
know
their
contents
that
they
were
straining
their
eyes
to
read
them
in
the
sickly
light
that
fell
from
a
sparse
row
of
electric
lamps
i
watched
their
faces
in
one
case
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
letter
was
a
and
that
the
girl
who
was
reading
it
was
tremendously
happy
in
another
i
wondered
whether
the
missive
had
come
from
a
son
it
was
for
miss
tevkin
return
that
i
was
watching
but
the
sounded
before
she
made
her
appearance
chapter
iii
dinner
at
the
rigi
kulm
on
a
saturday
evening
was
not
merely
a
meal
it
was
in
addition
or
chiefly
a
great
social
function
and
a
gown
contest
the
band
was
playing
as
each
matron
or
girl
made
her
appearance
in
the
vast
the
female
boarders
already
seated
would
look
her
over
with
feverish
interest
comparing
her
gown
and
diamonds
with
their
own
it
was
as
though
it
were
especially
for
this
parade
of
dresses
and
finery
that
the
band
was
playing
as
the
women
came
trooping
in
arrayed
for
the
exhibition
some
timid
others
brazenly
they
seemed
to
be
marching
in
time
to
the
music
like
so
many
tripping
before
a
theater
audience
or
like
a
procession
of
at
a
in
a
big
department
store
many
of
the
women
strutted
affectedly
with
refined
mien
indeed
i
knew
that
most
of
them
had
a
feeling
as
though
wearing
a
dress
was
in
itself
culture
and
education
kalch
kept
talking
to
me
now
aloud
now
in
whispers
she
was
passing
judgment
on
the
gowns
and
incidentally
initiating
me
into
some
of
the
innermost
details
of
the
gown
race
it
appeared
that
the
women
kept
tab
on
one
another
dresses
shoes
ribbons
pins
earrings
she
pointed
out
two
matrons
who
had
never
been
seen
twice
in
the
same
dress
waist
or
skirt
although
they
had
lived
in
the
hotel
for
more
than
five
weeks
of
one
woman
she
informed
me
that
she
could
afford
to
wear
a
new
gown
every
hour
in
the
year
but
that
she
was
too
big
a
slob
to
dress
up
and
too
lazy
to
undress
even
when
she
went
to
bed
of
another
that
she
would
owe
her
grocer
and
butcher
rather
than
go
to
the
country
with
less
than
ten
big
trunks
full
of
duds
of
a
third
that
she
was
repeatedly
threatening
to
leave
the
hotel
because
its
bills
of
fare
were
typewritten
whereas
for
the
money
she
paid
she
could
go
to
a
place
with
printed
must
have
been
brought
up
on
printed
one
of
the
other
women
at
our
table
commented
with
a
laugh
that
right
kalch
assented
appreciatively
i
could
not
say
whether
her
father
was
a
or
a
stoker
in
a
but
i
do
know
that
her
husband
kept
a
cellar
a
few
years
ago
that
do
her
bewhiskered
husband
it
about
time
you
gave
your
tongue
a
rest
auntie
yetta
golden
teeth
glittered
the
next
instant
she
called
my
attention
to
a
woman
who
driven
to
despair
by
the
superiority
of
her
bosom
friend
gowns
had
gone
to
the
city
for
a
fortnight
ostensibly
to
look
for
a
new
flat
but
in
reality
to
replenish
her
wardrobe
she
had
just
returned
on
the
big
husband
train
and
now
her
bosom
friend
wo
be
able
to
eat
or
sleep
trying
to
guess
what
kind
of
dresses
she
brought
back
nor
was
this
the
only
kind
of
gossip
upon
which
kalch
regaled
me
she
told
me
for
example
of
some
sensational
discoveries
made
by
several
boarders
regarding
a
certain
mother
of
five
children
of
her
sister
who
was
not
a
bit
better
and
of
a
couple
who
were
supposed
to
be
man
and
wife
but
who
seemed
to
be
somebody
else
man
and
somebody
else
wife
at
last
miss
tevkin
and
miss
siegel
entered
the
something
like
a
thrill
passed
through
me
i
felt
like
exclaiming
at
last
that
the
one
i
met
you
with
is
it
not
said
kalch
which
do
you
mean
do
you
mean
the
tall
one
of
course
the
one
you
were
so
sweet
on
not
the
dwarf
with
the
they
fine
educated
girls
both
of
them
i
rejoined
both
of
them
as
if
it
was
all
the
same
to
you
at
this
she
bent
over
and
gave
me
a
glare
and
a
smile
that
brought
the
color
to
my
face
the
tall
one
is
certainly
not
but
we
do
call
that
pretty
in
this
place
are
there
many
prettier
ones
i
asked
gaily
i
have
counted
them
but
i
can
show
you
some
girls
who
shine
like
the
sun
there
is
one
she
said
pointing
at
a
girl
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
a
regular
princess
do
you
think
so
she
a
pretty
girl
all
right
i
replied
but
in
comparison
with
that
tall
one
she
like
a
nice
piece
of
cotton
goods
alongside
of
a
piece
of
imported
silk
look
at
him
he
stuck
on
her
does
she
know
it
if
she
does
not
i
tell
her
and
collect
a
commission
i
loathed
myself
for
having
talked
too
much
i
was
joking
of
course
i
tried
to
mend
matters
all
girls
are
pretty
luckily
kalch
attention
was
at
this
point
diverted
by
the
arrival
of
the
waiter
with
a
huge
platter
laden
with
roast
chicken
which
he
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
table
there
ensued
a
silent
race
for
the
best
portions
one
of
the
other
two
women
at
the
table
was
the
first
to
obtain
possession
of
the
platter
taking
her
time
about
it
she
first
made
a
careful
examination
of
its
contents
and
then
attacked
what
she
evidently
considered
a
choice
piece
by
way
of
calling
my
attention
to
the
proceeding
auntie
yetta
stepped
on
my
foot
under
the
table
and
gave
me
a
knowing
glance
the
noise
in
the
was
unendurable
it
seemed
as
though
everybody
was
talking
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
musicians
a
pianist
and
two
violinists
found
it
difficult
to
make
themselves
heard
they
were
pounding
and
sawing
frantically
in
a
vain
effort
to
beat
the
bedlam
of
conversation
and
laughter
it
was
quite
touching
the
better
to
take
in
the
effect
of
the
turmoil
i
shut
my
eyes
for
a
moment
whereupon
the
noise
reminded
me
of
the
stock
exchange
the
conductor
who
played
the
first
violin
was
a
fiery
little
fellow
with
a
high
crown
of
black
hair
he
was
working
every
muscle
and
nerve
in
his
body
he
played
selections
from
aďda
the
favorite
opera
of
the
ghetto
he
played
the
popular
american
songs
of
the
day
he
played
celebrated
hits
of
the
yiddish
stage
all
to
no
purpose
finally
he
had
recourse
to
what
was
apparently
his
last
resort
he
struck
up
the
banner
the
effect
was
overwhelming
the
few
hundred
diners
rose
like
one
man
applauding
the
children
and
many
of
the
adults
caught
up
the
tune
joyously
passionately
it
was
an
interesting
scene
men
and
women
were
offering
thanksgiving
to
the
flag
under
which
they
were
eating
this
good
dinner
wearing
these
expensive
clothes
there
was
the
jingle
of
dollars
in
our
applause
but
there
was
something
else
in
it
as
well
many
of
those
who
were
now
paying
tribute
to
the
stars
and
stripes
were
listening
to
the
tune
with
grave
solemn
mien
it
was
as
if
they
were
saying
we
are
not
persecuted
under
this
flag
at
last
we
have
found
a
home
love
for
america
blazed
up
in
my
soul
i
shouted
to
the
musicians
my
country
and
the
cry
spread
like
wildfire
the
musicians
obeyed
and
we
all
sang
the
anthem
from
the
bottom
of
our
souls
chapter
iv
i
was
in
the
lobby
chatting
with
the
clerk
across
his
counter
and
casting
glances
at
the
door
miss
tevkin
had
not
yet
finished
her
meal
and
i
was
watching
for
her
to
appear
presently
she
did
toying
with
miss
siegel
hand
feeling
better
now
i
asked
stepping
up
to
meet
them
i
hope
you
enjoyed
your
dinner
oh
we
were
so
hungry
i
do
think
we
knew
what
we
were
eating
miss
tevkin
returned
politely
going
to
take
the
air
on
the
veranda
why
no
we
are
going
out
for
a
walk
she
answered
in
a
tone
that
said
as
clearly
as
words
that
my
company
was
not
wanted
and
nodding
with
exaggerated
amiability
they
passed
out
the
blood
rushed
to
my
face
as
though
she
had
slapped
it
i
stood
petrified
it
all
because
of
kalch
tongue
confound
her
i
thought
i
shall
be
in
tannersville
and
this
trifling
incident
will
be
forgotten
but
at
this
i
became
aware
that
i
did
not
care
to
go
to
tannersville
and
that
the
prospect
of
seeing
fanny
had
lost
its
attraction
for
me
i
went
back
to
the
counter
and
attempted
to
resume
my
conversation
with
the
clerk
but
he
was
a
handsome
fellow
which
was
one
of
his
chief
qualifications
for
the
place
and
so
i
soon
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
bevy
of
girls
and
married
women
however
they
all
seemed
to
know
that
i
was
a
desirable
match
and
they
gradually
transferred
their
attentions
to
me
the
girls
in
their
own
interests
and
the
older
matrons
in
those
of
their
marriageable
daughters
their
crude
amenities
sickened
me
one
woman
tried
to
monopolize
me
by
a
confidential
talk
concerning
the
social
inferiority
of
the
catskills
the
food
is
good
here
she
said
in
english
there
no
kick
comin
on
that
score
but
my
daughter
says
with
her
dresses
she
could
go
to
any
hotel
in
atlantic
city
and
she
right
too
i
care
what
you
say
i
fled
as
soon
as
i
could
i
went
to
look
for
a
seat
on
the
spacious
veranda
i
said
to
myself
that
miss
tevkin
and
miss
siegel
must
have
had
an
appointment
with
some
one
else
and
that
i
had
no
cause
for
feeling
slighted
by
them
i
felt
reassured
but
i
was
lonely
i
was
yearning
for
some
congenial
company
and
blamed
fate
for
having
allowed
miss
tevkin
to
make
another
engagement
if
she
had
the
veranda
was
crowded
and
almost
as
noisy
as
the
had
been
there
was
a
hubbub
of
broken
english
the
gibberish
being
mostly
spoken
with
and
ease
indeed
many
of
these
people
had
some
difficulty
in
speaking
their
native
tongue
bad
english
replete
with
literal
translations
from
untranslatable
yiddish
idioms
had
become
their
natural
speech
the
younger
parents
however
more
susceptible
of
the
influence
of
their
children
spoke
purer
english
it
was
a
dark
night
but
the
sky
was
full
of
stars
full
of
golden
mystery
the
mountains
rose
black
vast
disquieting
a
tumultuous
choir
of
invisible
katydids
was
reciting
an
interminable
poem
on
an
unpoetic
subject
that
had
something
to
do
with
miss
tevkin
the
air
was
even
richer
in
aroma
than
it
had
been
in
the
morning
but
its
breath
seemed
to
be
part
of
the
uncanny
stridulation
of
the
katydids
the
windows
of
the
beyond
the
level
part
of
the
lawn
gleamed
like
so
many
sheets
of
yellow
fire
presently
its
door
flew
open
sending
a
slanting
shaft
of
light
over
the
grass
i
found
a
chair
on
the
veranda
but
i
was
restless
and
the
chatter
of
two
women
in
front
of
me
grated
on
my
nerves
i
wondered
where
miss
tevkin
and
her
companion
were
at
this
minute
i
was
saying
to
myself
that
i
would
never
come
near
them
again
that
i
was
going
to
see
fanny
but
i
did
not
cease
wondering
where
they
were
the
two
women
in
front
of
me
were
discussing
the
relative
virtues
and
faults
of
little
boys
and
little
girls
they
agreed
that
a
boy
was
a
big
loafer
and
a
great
source
of
trouble
and
that
a
little
girl
was
more
obedient
and
clinging
it
appeared
that
one
of
these
two
mothers
had
a
boy
and
two
girls
and
that
contrary
to
her
own
wish
he
was
her
great
pet
although
he
was
not
the
baby
i
am
just
crazy
for
him
she
said
plaintively
she
boasted
of
his
baseball
record
whereupon
she
used
the
slang
of
the
game
with
so
much
authority
that
it
became
entertaining
but
by
a
curious
association
of
ideas
she
turned
the
conversation
to
the
subject
of
a
family
who
owed
the
their
last
summer
board
and
who
had
been
accepted
this
time
in
the
hope
that
they
would
pay
their
old
debt
as
well
as
their
new
bills
two
men
to
the
right
of
me
were
complaining
of
the
unions
and
the
walking
delegates
of
traveling
salesmen
of
buyers
then
they
took
up
the
subject
of
charity
whereupon
one
of
them
enlarged
on
scientific
philanthropy
apparently
for
the
sheer
lust
of
hearing
himself
use
the
term
i
recalled
that
one
of
the
things
i
was
booked
to
do
in
tannersville
was
to
attend
a
charity
meeting
of
east
side
business
men
of
which
kaplan
was
one
of
the
organizers
two
subscriptions
were
to
be
started
one
for
a
home
for
aged
immigrants
and
one
for
the
victims
of
the
riots
in
russia
and
i
was
expected
to
contribute
sums
large
enough
to
do
credit
to
my
prospective
the
multitudinous
jabber
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
scampering
feet
accompanied
by
merry
shrieks
a
young
girl
burst
from
the
vestibule
door
closely
followed
by
three
young
men
she
was
about
eighteen
years
old
well
fed
of
a
ravishing
complexion
her
evening
gown
leaving
her
plump
arms
and
a
good
deal
of
her
bust
exposed
one
of
the
on
the
porch
impeding
her
way
she
was
seized
by
her
pursuers
apparently
a
willing
victim
and
held
prisoner
two
of
her
captors
gripped
her
bare
arms
while
the
third
clutched
her
by
the
neck
thus
they
stood
the
men
stroking
and
kneading
her
luscious
flesh
and
she
beaming
and
giggling
rapturously
then
one
of
the
men
gathered
her
to
him
with
one
arm
pressing
his
cheek
against
hers
she
my
wife
he
jested
we
are
married
let
go
boys
i
sue
you
for
alimony
then
piped
the
girl
finally
they
released
her
and
the
next
minute
i
saw
them
walking
across
the
lawn
in
the
direction
of
the
the
man
who
had
talked
scientific
philanthropy
spat
in
disgust
shame
he
said
decent
young
people
would
behave
like
that
in
russia
would
they
indeed
they
would
his
interlocutor
assented
vehemently
people
over
there
have
yet
forgotten
what
decency
is
oh
well
it
was
only
a
joke
said
a
woman
a
nice
joke
that
retorted
the
man
who
had
dwelt
on
scientific
charity
what
would
you
have
would
you
want
young
people
to
be
a
lot
of
greenhorns
this
is
not
russia
they
are
americans
and
they
are
young
so
they
want
to
have
some
fun
they
are
just
as
respectable
as
the
boys
and
the
girls
in
the
old
country
only
there
is
some
life
to
them
that
all
young
people
were
moving
along
the
flagged
walk
or
crossing
the
lawn
from
various
directions
all
converging
toward
the
pavilion
they
walked
singly
in
twos
in
threes
and
in
larger
groups
some
trudging
along
leisurely
others
proceeding
at
a
hurried
pace
some
came
from
our
hotel
others
from
other
places
the
strangers
mostly
in
flocks
i
watched
them
as
they
sauntered
or
scurried
along
as
they
receded
through
the
thickening
gloom
as
they
emerged
from
it
into
the
slanting
shaft
of
light
that
fell
from
the
pavilion
and
as
they
vanished
in
its
blazing
doorway
i
gazed
at
the
spectacle
until
it
fascinated
me
as
something
weird
the
pavilion
with
its
brightly
illuminated
windows
was
an
immense
magic
lamp
and
the
young
people
flocking
to
it
so
many
huge
moths
of
a
supernatural
species
as
i
saw
them
disappear
in
the
glare
of
the
doorway
i
pictured
them
as
being
burned
up
i
was
tempted
to
join
the
unearthly
procession
and
to
be
burned
like
the
others
then
discarding
the
image
i
visioned
men
and
women
of
ordinary
flesh
and
blood
dancing
and
i
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
see
the
sexes
in
mutual
embrace
but
i
exhorted
myself
that
i
was
soon
to
be
a
married
man
and
that
it
was
as
well
to
keep
out
of
temptation
way
presently
i
saw
miss
tevkin
crossing
the
lawn
headed
for
the
pavilion
she
was
one
of
a
bevy
of
girls
and
men
i
watched
her
get
nearer
and
nearer
to
that
shaft
of
light
when
she
was
finally
swallowed
up
by
the
pavilion
the
lawn
disappeared
from
my
consciousness
my
thoughts
were
in
the
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
there
in
the
flesh
it
was
a
vast
room
and
it
was
crowded
it
was
some
time
before
i
located
miss
tevkin
the
chaotic
throng
of
dancers
was
a
welter
of
color
and
outline
so
superb
i
thought
that
it
seemed
as
though
every
face
and
figure
in
it
were
the
consummation
of
youthful
beauty
however
as
i
contemplated
the
individual
couples
in
quest
of
the
girl
who
filled
my
thoughts
i
met
with
disillusion
after
disillusion
then
after
recovering
from
a
sense
of
watching
a
parade
of
uncomeliness
i
began
to
discover
figures
or
faces
or
both
that
were
decidedly
charming
while
here
and
there
i
came
upon
a
young
woman
of
singular
beauty
the
number
of
women
or
women
with
expressive
faces
was
remarkably
large
in
fact
as
i
scanned
the
crowd
for
the
third
time
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
homely
women
looked
cleverer
than
the
pretty
ones
many
of
the
girls
or
matrons
were
dressed
far
more
daringly
than
they
would
have
been
a
year
or
two
before
almost
all
of
them
were
powdered
and
painted
prosperity
was
rapidly
breaking
the
chains
of
american
puritanism
rapidly
frenchifying
the
country
and
the
east
side
was
quick
to
fall
into
line
the
band
was
again
playing
with
might
and
main
the
vehement
little
conductor
was
again
exerting
every
nerve
and
muscle
his
bow
which
was
also
his
baton
was
pouring
vim
and
sex
mystery
into
the
dancers
as
i
looked
at
him
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
music
the
thunderous
clatter
of
feet
and
the
hum
of
voices
all
came
from
the
fiery
rhythm
of
his
arm
finally
i
discovered
miss
tevkin
she
was
dancing
with
a
homely
fellow
the
rhythmic
motion
of
her
tall
stately
frame
as
it
floated
and
swayed
through
the
dazzling
light
brought
a
sob
to
my
throat
when
the
waltz
was
over
and
her
cavalier
was
taking
her
to
a
seat
i
caught
her
eye
i
nodded
and
smiled
to
her
she
returned
the
greeting
but
immediately
averted
her
face
again
i
felt
as
if
she
had
slapped
my
cheek
was
i
repugnant
to
her
i
thought
of
my
victory
over
the
acrimonious
photographer
at
the
railroad
station
had
i
not
won
her
favor
there
and
it
came
over
me
that
even
on
that
occasion
she
had
shown
me
but
scant
cordiality
was
it
all
because
of
auntie
yetta
idiotic
jest
she
beckoned
to
miss
siegel
who
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
and
presently
she
was
joined
by
her
and
by
some
other
young
people
she
danced
indefatigably
now
with
this
man
now
with
that
but
always
of
the
same
set
i
watched
her
sometimes
as
she
waltzed
she
talked
and
laughed
brokenly
exchanging
jokes
with
her
partner
or
with
some
other
dancing
couple
sometimes
she
looked
solemnly
absorbed
as
though
dancing
were
a
sacred
function
i
wondered
whether
she
was
interested
in
any
one
of
these
fellows
in
particular
i
could
see
that
it
gave
her
special
pleasure
to
waltz
with
that
man
but
he
was
the
best
dancer
in
her
group
and
so
homely
that
i
discarded
the
theory
of
her
caring
for
him
otherwise
than
as
a
waltzing
partner
as
absurd
nor
did
she
seem
to
be
particularly
interested
in
anybody
else
on
the
floor
as
i
scrutinized
the
men
of
her
set
i
said
to
myself
they
seem
to
be
or
writers
or
beginning
physicians
perhaps
they
probably
make
less
than
of
what
i
pay
bender
yet
they
freely
talk
and
joke
with
her
while
i
can
not
even
get
near
her
miss
lazar
half
naked
had
been
dancing
with
various
partners
most
of
all
with
a
freckled
lad
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
who
looked
as
though
he
were
panting
to
kiss
her
she
and
i
had
exchanged
smiles
and
pleasantry
but
in
her
she
was
far
less
prepossessing
than
she
had
been
in
the
afternoon
and
i
had
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
announce
it
to
her
or
to
hurt
her
in
some
other
way
finally
seeing
a
vacant
seat
by
my
side
she
abruptly
broke
away
from
the
freckled
youth
and
took
it
you
have
to
excuse
me
ben
she
said
i
tired
ben
looked
the
picture
of
despair
do
cry
ben
go
out
and
take
a
walk
or
dance
with
some
other
girl
is
this
your
catch
after
many
days
of
fishing
i
asked
nope
i
angling
for
bigger
fish
he
just
ben
a
college
boy
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
me
this
evening
when
i
dance
with
somebody
else
he
gets
awful
jealous
she
laughed
he
a
boy
for
all
his
freckles
he
is
but
how
would
you
like
a
little
girl
to
fall
in
love
with
you
i
made
no
answer
why
do
you
dance
she
asked
not
in
my
line
why
oh
i
never
cared
to
learn
it
i
answered
impatiently
come
i
show
you
how
it
very
simple
too
old
for
that
kind
of
thing
too
old
how
old
are
you
that
an
indiscreet
question
would
you
tell
me
your
age
indeed
i
would
why
not
she
said
with
sportive
defiance
only
you
would
believe
me
why
would
i
do
you
look
much
older
oh
you
cruel
thing
i
just
years
and
four
months
there
she
said
with
embarrassed
gaiety
a
sort
of
birthday
is
it
i
congratulate
you
thank
you
you
welcome
a
pause
so
you
wo
tell
me
how
old
you
are
will
you
she
resumed
what
do
you
want
to
know
it
for
are
you
in
the
business
another
pause
look
at
that
girl
over
there
she
said
trying
to
make
conversation
she
showing
off
her
slender
figure
she
thinks
she
looks
awful
american
you
do
have
a
sharp
tongue
but
you
remember
what
kalch
said
sharp
tongue
but
a
kind
heart
the
band
struck
up
a
ben
was
coming
over
to
her
his
freckled
face
the
image
of
supplication
she
shut
her
eyes
and
shook
her
head
and
the
boy
stopped
short
his
jaw
dropping
as
he
did
so
do
be
hard
on
the
poor
boy
i
pleaded
that
none
of
your
business
i
want
you
to
dance
with
me
come
on
i
teach
you
i
shut
my
eyes
and
shook
my
head
precisely
as
she
had
done
to
ben
she
burst
into
a
laugh
ai
you
tired
of
being
a
i
love
it
do
you
really
or
maybe
you
want
to
watch
somebody
i
want
to
watch
everybody
i
replied
coloring
the
least
bit
when
you
were
dancing
i
watched
you
and
i
thought
well
i
wo
tell
you
what
i
thought
a
splash
of
color
overspread
her
face
go
ahead
speak
out
she
said
with
a
sick
smile
i
took
pity
on
her
i
joking
of
course
but
i
do
like
to
watch
people
when
they
dance
i
said
earnestly
they
do
it
in
so
many
different
ways
do
you
know
i
proceeded
to
point
out
couple
after
couple
commenting
upon
their
peculiar
manner
and
the
special
expression
of
their
faces
one
man
was
seemingly
about
to
hurl
his
partner
at
somebody
another
man
was
eying
other
women
over
the
shoulder
of
the
one
with
whom
he
danced
apparently
his
wife
one
woman
was
clinging
to
her
partner
with
all
her
might
while
her
eyes
and
mouth
seemed
to
say
my
is
it
sweet
miss
lazar
greeted
my
observations
with
bursts
of
merry
approval
encouraged
by
this
and
full
of
mischief
and
malice
i
made
her
watch
a
man
with
tapering
white
and
watery
eyes
who
was
staring
at
the
bare
bust
of
a
fat
woman
you
had
better
look
out
for
his
watery
eyes
will
soon
be
on
you
miss
lazar
lowered
her
head
and
burst
into
a
confused
giggle
you
a
holy
terror
she
declared
i
was
tempted
to
take
her
out
into
the
night
and
hug
and
kiss
her
and
tell
her
that
she
was
a
nuisance
but
the
fear
of
a
suit
held
me
in
leash
i
rose
to
go
as
i
picked
my
way
through
the
crowd
i
watched
miss
tevkin
who
sat
between
miss
siegel
and
one
of
their
cavaliers
our
eyes
met
but
she
hastened
to
look
away
she
has
certainly
made
up
her
mind
to
shun
me
i
thought
wretchedly
she
knows
i
am
worth
about
a
million
and
yet
she
does
not
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
must
be
a
socialist
the
idea
of
a
typewriter
girl
cutting
me
pooh
i
could
get
a
prettier
girl
than
she
and
one
too
if
i
only
cared
for
that
kind
of
thing
in
a
wife
let
her
stick
to
her
beggarly
crowd
it
all
seemed
so
ridiculous
i
was
baffled
perplexed
full
of
contempt
and
misery
at
once
perhaps
she
is
engaged
after
all
i
comforted
myself
feeling
that
there
was
anything
but
comfort
in
the
reflection
i
was
burning
to
have
an
explanation
with
her
to
remove
any
bad
impression
i
might
have
made
upon
her
an
asphalt
walk
in
front
of
the
pavilion
and
the
adjoining
section
of
the
lawn
were
astir
with
boarders
a
tall
woman
of
thirty
of
excellent
figure
and
all
but
naked
passed
along
like
a
flame
the
men
frankly
gloating
over
her
flesh
wait
a
moment
what
your
hurry
a
young
stallion
shouted
running
after
her
hungrily
in
another
spot
on
the
lawn
i
saw
a
young
man
in
evening
dress
chaffing
a
girl
who
looked
no
more
than
fifteen
what
sweet
sixteen
and
not
yet
kissed
he
said
to
her
aloud
go
on
i
do
believe
it
anyhow
i
like
to
be
the
fellow
going
to
get
you
would
you
i
tell
your
wife
about
it
the
little
girl
replied
with
the
good
humor
of
a
woman
of
forty
never
mind
my
wife
but
how
about
the
fellow
who
is
going
to
marry
you
i
like
to
see
him
myself
i
hope
he
ai
going
to
be
some
boob
the
air
was
redolent
of
grass
flowers
ozone
and
sex
all
this
was
flavored
with
miss
tevkin
antipathy
for
me
chapter
v
the
next
morning
i
awoke
utterly
out
of
sorts
that
i
was
going
to
take
the
first
train
for
tannersville
seemed
to
be
a
matter
of
course
and
yet
i
knew
that
i
was
not
going
to
take
that
train
nor
any
other
that
day
i
dressed
myself
and
went
out
for
a
walk
up
the
road
some
distance
beyond
the
grove
the
sun
was
out
but
it
had
rained
all
night
and
the
sandy
road
was
damp
solid
and
smooth
like
baked
clay
it
was
half
an
hour
before
when
i
returned
to
my
cottage
across
the
road
from
the
hotel
as
i
was
about
to
take
a
chair
on
the
tiny
porch
i
perceived
the
sunlit
figure
of
miss
tevkin
in
the
distance
she
wore
a
large
sailor
hat
and
i
thought
it
greatly
enhanced
the
effect
of
her
tall
figure
she
was
making
her
way
over
a
shaky
little
bridge
then
reaching
the
road
she
turned
into
it
i
remained
standing
like
one
transfixed
the
distance
gave
her
new
fascination
every
little
while
she
would
pause
to
look
up
through
something
that
glittered
in
the
sunshine
apparently
an
i
had
never
heard
that
were
used
for
observing
birds
but
this
was
evidently
what
she
was
doing
at
this
moment
and
the
proceeding
quickened
my
sense
not
only
of
her
intellectual
refinement
but
also
of
her
social
distinction
presently
she
turned
into
a
byway
passed
the
grove
and
was
lost
to
view
i
seated
myself
my
eye
on
the
spot
where
i
had
seen
her
disappear
somebody
greeted
me
from
the
hotel
lawn
i
returned
the
salutation
mechanically
and
went
on
gazing
at
that
spot
i
knew
that
i
was
making
a
fool
of
myself
but
i
could
not
help
it
my
was
gone
as
it
might
from
the
effect
of
some
drug
when
she
reappeared
at
last
and
i
saw
her
coming
back
i
crossed
over
to
the
hotel
veranda
so
as
to
be
near
her
when
she
should
arrive
i
found
several
of
the
boarders
there
including
the
lawyer
the
photographer
and
a
jewelry
merchant
of
my
acquaintance
we
all
watched
her
coming
at
one
moment
as
she
leveled
her
at
a
bird
the
lawyer
said
studying
birds
she
a
great
girl
for
studying
she
is
studying
nothing
the
photographer
jeered
it
simply
becoming
to
her
it
effective
do
you
know
the
lawyer
smiled
sagely
as
if
what
mendelson
said
was
precisely
what
he
himself
had
meant
to
intimate
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
mendelson
was
right
but
this
did
not
detract
from
the
force
that
drew
me
to
miss
tevkin
when
she
reached
the
veranda
the
lawyer
gallantly
offered
her
a
chair
but
she
declined
it
pleasantly
and
went
indoors
her
high
heels
had
left
deep
imprints
in
a
small
patch
of
damp
sandy
ground
near
the
veranda
this
physical
trace
of
her
person
fascinated
me
it
was
a
trace
of
stern
hostility
yet
i
could
not
keep
my
eye
away
from
it
i
gazed
and
gazed
at
those
of
hers
till
i
seemed
to
be
growing
stupid
and
dizzy
am
i
losing
my
head
i
said
to
myself
am
i
obsessed
why
i
saw
her
yesterday
for
the
first
time
and
i
have
scarcely
spoken
to
her
what
the
devil
is
the
matter
with
me
after
breakfast
we
returned
to
the
veranda
the
and
the
lawyer
bored
me
unmercifully
finally
i
was
saved
from
them
by
the
arrival
of
the
sunday
papers
but
my
reading
was
soon
disturbed
by
the
intrusions
of
a
mother
and
her
marriageable
daughter
there
was
no
escape
i
had
to
lay
down
my
paper
and
let
them
torture
me
there
was
a
striking
family
resemblance
between
the
two
yet
the
daughter
was
as
homely
as
the
mother
was
pretty
she
is
as
prepossessing
as
her
ma
of
course
the
older
woman
seemed
to
be
saying
to
me
but
she
charming
all
the
same
is
she
miss
lazar
was
watching
me
at
a
respectful
distance
kalch
was
deep
in
a
game
of
pinochle
in
a
small
room
that
gave
out
on
the
veranda
the
window
was
open
and
i
could
hear
kalch
voice
she
seemed
to
have
been
losing
the
little
room
by
the
way
was
used
both
as
a
synagogue
and
a
in
the
mornings
before
breakfast
it
was
filled
with
old
men
in
and
phylacteries
while
the
rest
of
the
day
until
late
at
night
it
was
in
the
possession
of
i
wanted
to
wire
bender
to
send
a
message
to
fanny
in
my
name
stating
that
i
had
been
unavoidably
detained
in
the
city
but
i
lacked
the
energy
to
do
so
i
had
not
even
the
energy
to
extricate
myself
from
the
attentions
of
the
pretty
mother
of
the
homely
girl
that
charity
meeting
bothered
me
more
than
anything
else
one
was
apt
to
impute
my
absence
to
meanness
i
pictured
disappointment
and
i
felt
like
going
to
tannersville
for
his
sake
if
for
no
other
reason
the
next
best
thing
would
have
been
to
have
bender
wire
my
contribution
to
each
of
the
two
funds
but
i
did
not
stir
the
came
out
to
remind
me
of
my
train
thank
you
i
said
with
a
smile
but
the
weather
is
too
confoundedly
good
i
too
lazy
to
leave
your
place
rivesman
you
must
have
ordered
this
weather
on
purpose
to
detain
me
i
was
hoping
of
course
that
my
presence
in
this
hotel
would
be
unknown
to
the
kaplans
for
some
time
at
least
soon
however
something
happened
which
made
it
inevitable
that
they
should
hear
of
it
that
very
evening
on
sundays
the
jewish
summer
hotels
are
usually
visited
by
committees
of
various
philanthropic
institutions
who
go
from
place
to
place
making
speeches
and
collecting
donations
one
such
committee
appeared
in
the
of
the
rigi
kulm
at
the
which
on
sundays
was
between
and
it
represented
a
day
nursery
an
establishment
where
the
children
of
the
east
side
poor
are
taken
care
of
while
their
mothers
are
at
work
and
it
consisted
of
two
men
one
of
whom
was
an
eloquent
young
rabbi
as
the
ecclesiastic
took
his
stand
near
the
piano
and
began
his
appeal
my
heart
sank
within
me
i
had
once
met
him
at
house
where
he
was
a
frequent
visitor
and
had
given
him
a
check
it
goes
without
saying
that
i
had
to
give
him
a
contribution
now
and
to
talk
to
him
at
this
i
learned
to
my
consternation
that
he
was
going
to
tannersville
that
very
afternoon
shall
i
convey
your
regards
he
asked
very
kind
of
you
i
answered
and
i
added
in
an
undertone
out
of
kalch
hearing
please
tell
kaplan
i
here
on
an
important
matter
and
that
i
have
been
detained
longer
than
i
expected
when
he
had
gone
over
to
the
next
table
i
said
to
myself
i
care
come
what
may
in
the
evening
as
the
crowd
swarmed
out
of
the
it
was
greeted
by
a
gorgeous
sunset
everybody
appreciated
its
beauty
but
miss
tevkin
and
miss
siegel
went
into
ecstasies
over
it
with
something
of
the
specialist
in
their
exclamations
as
for
me
it
was
the
first
rich
sunset
i
had
seen
since
i
crossed
the
ocean
and
then
i
had
scarcely
known
what
it
was
the
play
of
color
and
light
in
the
sky
was
a
revelation
to
me
the
edge
of
the
sun
a
vivid
red
was
peeping
out
of
a
gray
patch
of
cloud
that
looked
like
a
sack
the
sack
hanging
with
its
mouth
downward
and
the
red
disk
slowly
emerging
from
it
spread
directly
underneath
was
a
pool
of
molten
gold
into
which
the
sun
was
seemingly
about
to
drop
as
the
disk
continued
to
glide
out
of
the
bag
it
gradually
grew
into
a
huge
fiery
ball
of
magnificent
crimson
suffusing
the
valley
with
divine
light
at
the
moment
when
it
was
just
going
to
plunge
into
the
golden
pool
the
pool
vanished
the
crimson
ball
kept
sinking
until
it
was
buried
in
a
region
of
darkness
when
the
last
fiery
speck
of
it
disappeared
the
sky
broke
into
an
evensong
of
color
so
solemn
so
pensive
that
my
wretched
mood
interpreted
it
as
a
visible
dirge
for
the
dead
sun
rose
lapsed
into
purple
purple
merged
into
blue
the
blue
bordering
on
a
field
of
hammered
gold
that
was
changing
shape
and
hue
all
of
which
was
eloquent
of
sadness
it
seemed
as
though
the
heavens
were
in
an
ecstasy
of
grief
and
everybody
about
me
were
about
to
break
into
tears
some
of
the
old
women
gasped
how
nice
is
it
lovely
said
several
girls
is
that
glorious
said
miss
tevkin
it
one
of
the
most
exquisite
sunsets
i
have
seen
in
a
long
time
and
she
referred
to
certain
effects
apparently
in
the
work
of
a
landscape
painter
which
i
did
not
understand
i
discovered
a
note
of
consciousness
in
her
rapture
something
like
a
patronizing
approval
of
the
sky
by
one
who
looked
at
it
with
a
professional
eye
nevertheless
i
felt
that
my
poor
soul
was
cringing
before
her
an
epigram
occurred
to
me
something
about
the
discrepancy
between
the
spiritual
quality
of
the
sunset
and
the
satisfaction
of
the
onlookers
i
essayed
to
express
it
but
was
so
embarrassed
that
i
made
a
muddle
of
my
english
miss
tevkin
took
no
notice
of
the
remark
the
sunset
was
transformed
into
a
thousand
lumps
of
pearl
here
and
there
edged
with
flame
in
some
places
the
pearl
thinned
away
dissolving
into
the
color
of
the
sky
while
the
outline
of
the
lump
remained
a
map
of
glowing
tracery
on
a
ground
of
the
subtlest
blue
drifts
of
gold
were
gleaming
blazing
going
out
a
vast
heap
of
silver
caught
fire
the
outlined
map
disappeared
its
place
being
taken
by
a
raised
one
with
continents
islands
mountains
and
seas
of
ravishing
azure
what
was
the
power
behind
this
sublime
spectacle
where
did
it
come
from
what
did
it
all
mean
i
visioned
a
chorus
of
angels
my
heart
was
full
of
god
full
of
that
stately
girl
full
of
misery
if
i
only
got
a
chance
to
have
a
decent
talk
with
her
i
said
to
myself
again
and
again
chapter
vi
it
was
monday
afternoon
the
boarders
and
many
others
had
left
and
i
was
still
idling
my
precious
time
away
on
the
big
veranda
listening
to
the
gossip
of
women
who
bored
me
and
trying
to
keep
track
of
a
girl
who
shunned
me
my
establishment
in
new
york
was
feverishly
busy
and
my
presence
was
urgently
needed
there
it
was
more
than
probable
that
bender
had
wired
to
tannersville
to
call
me
home
the
situation
was
extremely
awkward
moreover
i
was
beginning
to
feel
uneasy
about
certain
payments
that
required
my
personal
attendance
it
was
a
quiet
pleasant
afternoon
the
boarders
were
scattered
over
the
various
parts
of
the
hotel
and
its
surroundings
of
them
forming
two
coach
parties
had
gone
to
see
some
celebrated
catskill
views
one
to
the
old
mountain
house
and
the
other
to
east
windham
some
were
in
the
village
miss
tevkin
wearing
her
immense
straw
hat
and
with
her
in
her
hand
was
looking
at
birds
in
the
vicinity
of
the
hotel
thus
rambling
about
leisurely
she
sauntered
over
to
the
main
road
near
the
grove
a
few
minutes
later
she
turned
into
the
same
path
where
i
had
watched
her
disappear
on
the
morning
of
the
day
before
and
once
more
i
saw
her
vanish
there
i
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
opposite
direction
soon
however
i
turned
back
strolling
with
studied
aimiessness
toward
that
spot
what
was
my
purpose
at
first
i
did
not
know
but
by
little
and
little
as
i
moved
along
an
idea
took
shape
in
my
brain
if
i
met
her
alone
i
might
force
her
to
listen
to
me
and
let
her
see
the
stuff
i
was
made
of
i
lacked
courage
however
while
i
was
priming
myself
for
the
coup
i
wished
that
it
would
be
postponed
i
dawdled
there
were
swarms
of
strange
insects
on
the
road
creatures
i
had
never
seen
before
at
first
i
thought
they
were
grasshoppers
but
they
were
gray
and
had
wings
every
now
and
then
i
would
pause
to
watch
them
leap
or
were
they
flying
and
drop
to
the
ground
again
becoming
part
of
the
dusty
road
i
followed
them
with
genuine
interest
yet
all
the
time
i
kept
working
on
the
speech
that
i
was
going
to
deliver
to
miss
tevkin
i
was
lingering
at
a
spot
a
few
yards
from
the
grove
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
main
road
when
suddenly
twilight
fell
over
half
of
the
valley
i
raised
my
eyes
behold
an
inky
cloud
was
crawling
over
the
mountains
growing
in
size
as
it
advanced
a
flash
of
lightning
snapped
across
the
heavens
it
was
as
though
the
sky
screened
a
world
of
dazzling
glory
into
which
a
glimpse
had
now
been
offered
by
a
momentary
crack
in
the
screen
the
flash
was
followed
by
a
devout
peal
of
thunder
as
if
a
giant
whose
abode
was
in
those
dark
clouds
broke
into
a
murmur
of
glorification
at
sight
of
the
splendors
above
the
sky
the
trees
shuddered
i
went
under
cover
a
farmer
was
chasing
a
cow
as
my
eyes
turned
toward
the
grove
they
fell
on
miss
tevkin
who
was
standing
at
the
farther
end
of
it
under
its
leafy
roof
facing
the
main
road
my
heart
beat
fast
i
dared
not
stir
a
shower
broke
loose
a
great
torrential
downpour
it
came
in
sheets
with
an
impetuous
though
genial
clatter
it
seemed
as
though
the
valley
was
swiftly
filling
with
water
and
in
less
than
an
hour
time
it
would
reach
the
tops
of
the
trees
i
thought
of
flood
i
could
almost
see
his
dove
winging
her
way
over
the
waters
the
storm
had
been
in
progress
but
seven
or
eight
minutes
when
it
came
to
an
end
the
sky
broke
into
a
smile
again
as
if
it
had
all
been
a
joke
miss
tevkin
left
the
shelter
of
the
trees
and
set
out
in
the
direction
of
the
hotel
i
do
not
know
whether
she
was
aware
of
my
proximity
it
was
clearing
beautifully
when
a
new
cloud
gathered
this
time
a
great
stern
force
violent
vengeful
came
into
play
a
lash
of
fire
smote
the
firmament
with
frantic
suddenness
shattering
it
into
a
myriad
of
blinding
sparks
yet
leaving
it
uninjured
there
was
a
pause
and
then
came
a
ferocious
crash
the
universe
was
falling
to
pieces
then
somebody
seemed
to
be
tearing
an
inner
heaven
of
metal
as
one
tears
a
sheet
of
linen
this
released
a
torrent
that
descended
with
the
roar
of
niagara
as
though
the
metal
vault
that
had
just
been
rent
asunder
had
been
its
prison
miss
tevkin
ran
back
to
cover
the
torrent
slackened
settling
down
to
a
steady
rain
spirited
zealous
amicable
again
in
a
turmoil
of
agitation
i
crossed
over
to
her
instead
however
of
beginning
at
the
beginning
of
my
little
speech
i
blurted
out
something
else
you
ca
run
away
from
me
now
i
said
with
timid
flippancy
please
leave
me
alone
she
besought
turning
away
i
was
literally
stunned
instead
of
trying
to
say
what
i
had
in
my
mind
and
to
force
her
to
listen
i
slunk
away
in
the
rain
like
a
beaten
dog
the
shock
seemed
to
have
a
sobering
effect
on
me
i
suddenly
realized
the
imbecility
of
the
part
i
had
been
playing
even
the
humor
of
it
the
first
thing
i
did
upon
reaching
the
hotel
was
to
ask
the
clerk
about
the
next
train
not
to
tannersville
but
direct
to
new
york
going
to
see
fanny
was
out
of
the
question
now
there
was
a
late
train
connecting
with
a
hudson
river
boat
and
i
took
it
chapter
vii
when
i
got
home
and
my
business
reasserted
its
multitudinous
demands
on
my
attention
the
catskill
incident
seemed
to
be
fading
into
the
character
of
a
passing
episode
but
i
was
mistaken
the
pang
it
left
in
my
heart
persisted
a
fortnight
after
my
return
to
the
city
i
forced
myself
to
take
a
trip
to
tannersville
fanny
came
to
meet
me
at
the
train
as
we
kissed
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
i
was
irretrievably
estranged
from
her
i
tried
to
play
my
part
with
poor
success
are
you
worried
dave
what
the
matter
with
you
fanny
demanded
again
and
again
her
what
the
matter
with
you
jarred
on
me
i
offered
her
sundry
excuses
but
i
did
not
even
take
pains
to
make
them
ring
true
finally
she
had
a
cry
and
i
kissed
her
tears
away
while
doing
so
i
worked
myself
into
a
mild
fit
of
love
but
my
lips
had
scarcely
released
hers
when
it
was
again
clear
to
me
that
she
was
not
going
to
be
my
wife
our
engagement
was
broken
shortly
after
the
family
came
back
to
the
city
that
burden
lifted
it
seemed
as
though
the
memory
of
my
unfortunate
acquaintance
with
miss
tevkin
had
suddenly
grown
in
clarity
and
painful
acuteness
our
rush
season
had
passed
but
we
were
busy
preparing
for
our
removal
to
new
quarters
on
fifth
avenue
near
street
that
locality
had
already
become
the
center
of
the
trade
being
built
up
with
new
full
of
and
the
sight
of
the
celebrated
avenue
swarming
with
jewish
mechanics
out
for
their
lunch
hour
or
going
home
after
a
day
work
was
already
a
daily
spectacle
the
new
aspect
of
that
section
of
the
proud
thoroughfare
marked
the
advent
of
the
russian
jew
as
the
head
of
one
of
the
largest
industries
in
the
united
states
also
it
meant
that
as
master
of
that
industry
he
had
made
good
for
in
his
hands
it
had
increased
a
hundredfold
garments
that
had
formerly
reached
only
the
few
having
been
placed
within
the
reach
of
the
masses
foreigners
ourselves
and
mostly
unable
to
speak
english
we
had
americanized
the
system
of
providing
clothes
for
the
american
woman
of
moderate
or
humble
means
the
ingenuity
and
unyielding
tenacity
of
our
managers
foremen
and
operatives
had
introduced
a
thousand
and
one
devices
for
making
by
machine
garments
that
used
to
be
considered
possible
only
as
the
product
of
handwork
this
added
to
a
vastly
increased
division
of
labor
the
invention
at
our
instance
of
all
sorts
of
machinery
for
the
manufacture
of
trimmings
and
the
enormous
scale
upon
which
production
was
carried
on
by
us
had
the
effect
of
cheapening
the
better
class
of
garments
prodigiously
we
had
done
away
with
prohibitive
prices
and
greatly
improved
the
popular
taste
indeed
the
russian
jew
had
made
the
average
american
girl
a
girl
when
i
learned
the
trade
a
cloak
made
of
the
cheapest
satinette
cost
eighteen
dollars
nobody
would
wear
it
one
can
now
buy
a
whole
suit
made
of
material
and
for
fifteen
dollars
what
i
have
said
of
cloaks
and
suits
applies
also
to
skirts
and
dresses
the
production
of
which
is
a
branch
of
our
trade
it
was
the
russian
jew
who
had
introduced
the
gown
constantly
perfecting
it
and
reducing
the
cost
of
its
production
the
silk
dress
which
the
american
woman
of
small
means
now
buys
for
a
few
dollars
is
of
the
very
latest
style
and
as
tasteful
in
its
lines
color
scheme
and
trimming
as
a
designer
can
make
it
a
gown
is
copied
from
a
model
whereupon
our
gifted
are
indefatigably
at
work
on
the
problem
of
providing
a
good
fit
for
almost
any
figure
with
as
little
alteration
as
possible
and
the
results
achieved
in
this
direction
are
truly
phenomenal
nor
is
it
mere
apish
copying
we
make
it
our
business
to
know
how
the
american
woman
wants
to
look
what
sort
of
lines
she
would
like
her
figure
to
have
many
a
time
when
i
saw
a
american
woman
in
the
street
i
followed
her
for
blocks
scanning
the
of
her
cloak
jacket
or
suit
i
never
wearied
of
studying
the
trend
of
the
american
woman
taste
the
subject
had
become
a
veritable
idée
fixé
with
me
the
average
american
woman
is
the
average
woman
in
the
world
and
the
russian
jew
has
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
making
her
one
my
fifth
avenue
establishment
occupied
four
vast
floors
the
rent
being
thousand
dollars
a
year
the
office
floor
which
was
elaborately
furnished
had
an
immense
with
gold
letters
on
doors
of
dull
glass
bearing
the
legends
general
offices
private
offices
salesmen
please
show
samples
of
merchandise
between
and
and
information
the
private
office
door
led
to
a
secluded
little
kingdom
with
the
inscription
david
levinsky
on
one
of
its
several
doors
another
door
leading
from
my
private
office
to
the
showrooms
i
employed
a
large
staff
of
trained
bookkeepers
stenographers
clerks
and
cloak
models
these
models
were
all
american
girls
of
origin
since
a
young
woman
of
other
stock
is
not
likely
to
be
built
on
american
lines
with
the
exception
of
scandinavian
and
irish
girls
who
have
the
american
figure
but
the
figure
alone
was
not
enough
i
thought
in
selecting
my
i
preferred
a
face
and
good
manners
and
if
possible
good
grammar
experience
had
taught
me
that
refinement
in
a
model
was
helpful
in
making
a
sale
even
in
the
case
of
the
least
refined
of
customers
indeed
often
it
is
even
more
effectual
than
a
tempting
complexion
my
new
place
was
the
talk
of
the
trade
friends
came
to
look
it
over
i
received
numerous
letters
of
congratulation
from
mill
men
bankers
retail
merchants
buyers
private
friends
my
range
of
acquaintance
was
very
wide
in
hundreds
of
american
cities
and
towns
there
were
business
people
with
whom
my
firm
was
in
correspondence
or
whom
i
knew
personally
who
called
me
dave
and
whom
i
called
jim
jack
or
ned
so
many
of
these
people
having
received
my
circular
describing
my
new
place
sent
their
felicitations
some
of
these
letters
were
inspired
by
genuine
admiration
for
my
enterprise
and
energy
all
of
them
had
genuine
admiration
for
my
success
success
success
success
it
was
the
almighty
goddess
of
the
hour
thousands
of
new
fortunes
were
advertising
her
gaudy
splendors
newspapers
magazines
and
public
speeches
were
full
of
her
glory
and
he
who
found
favor
in
her
eyes
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
man
nodelman
scarcely
ever
left
my
place
during
the
first
three
days
he
would
show
visitors
over
the
four
floors
with
a
charming
pride
like
that
of
a
mother
among
the
things
he
exhibited
was
the
of
my
first
check
account
a
photograph
of
the
rickety
house
where
i
had
had
my
first
shop
and
letters
of
congratulation
from
some
financiers
bender
with
a
big
shining
bald
disk
on
his
head
slender
and
spruce
as
ever
was
fussing
around
with
the
gruff
air
of
an
unappreciated
genius
while
loeb
also
but
fat
and
beaming
was
telling
everybody
about
the
scraps
he
and
i
used
to
have
on
the
road
when
he
was
a
star
drummer
and
i
a
struggling
beginner
one
of
the
men
who
came
to
congratulate
me
at
my
magnificent
new
place
on
fifth
avenue
was
the
kindly
american
commission
merchant
who
had
been
the
first
to
grant
me
credit
when
i
was
badly
in
need
of
it
as
i
took
him
over
my
immense
factory
splendid
showrooms
and
offices
we
recalled
the
days
when
it
took
a
man
of
special
generosity
to
treat
a
beginning
manufacturer
of
my
type
as
he
had
treated
me
that
was
the
time
when
would
even
refuse
to
bother
with
a
check
of
a
russian
jew
he
had
to
bring
cash
in
the
rôle
of
manufacturer
he
was
regarded
as
a
joke
by
hard
work
perseverance
thrift
and
ingenuity
however
we
had
completely
changed
all
that
by
the
time
i
moved
to
the
avenue
our
beginners
could
get
any
amount
of
credit
the
american
merchants
dealing
in
raw
material
had
gradually
realized
our
energy
ability
and
responsibility
realized
that
we
were
a
good
risk
while
we
on
our
part
had
assimilated
the
ways
of
the
advanced
american
business
man
another
man
who
came
to
see
my
new
establishment
was
eaton
the
philadelphia
buyer
who
had
given
me
my
first
lesson
in
table
manners
he
had
a
small
but
business
of
his
own
now
and
it
was
with
my
financial
aid
that
he
had
founded
it
our
friendship
had
never
flagged
sometimes
i
go
to
spend
a
day
or
two
in
his
cozy
little
house
in
north
philadelphia
where
i
feel
as
much
at
home
as
i
do
in
bender
or
nodelman
house
i
assigned
one
of
my
office
men
to
the
special
duty
of
looking
up
and
inviting
mr
even
the
kindly
old
man
who
had
bought
me
my
first
american
suit
of
clothes
and
paid
for
my
first
american
bath
he
came
back
with
the
report
that
mr
even
had
been
dead
for
over
four
years
the
news
was
a
genuine
shock
to
me
it
was
as
though
it
had
come
from
my
birthplace
and
concerned
the
death
of
a
relative
it
stirred
a
swarm
of
memories
but
of
course
impressions
and
moods
of
this
kind
do
not
last
long
i
received
requests
for
donations
from
all
sorts
of
east
side
institutions
and
i
responded
liberally
mindels
the
handsome
doctor
made
me
contribute
hundred
dollars
to
a
prospective
hospital
in
which
he
expected
to
be
one
of
the
leading
spirits
there
was
dining
and
wining
i
was
being
toasted
complimented
blessed
one
of
these
dinners
was
given
in
my
honor
by
my
office
employees
salesmen
designers
and
foremen
bender
who
presided
told
in
an
elaborate
and
oration
of
his
experiences
as
my
of
our
walks
after
school
hours
and
of
our
chance
meeting
a
few
years
later
loeb
made
a
speech
the
gist
of
which
was
a
joke
on
the
bottle
of
milk
which
i
had
spilled
while
in
the
employ
of
manheimer
brothers
and
which
had
led
to
my
becoming
a
manufacturer
his
concluding
words
were
there
at
least
one
saying
that
has
come
true
i
mean
the
saying
no
use
crying
over
spilled
milk
levinsky
you
certainly
have
no
reason
to
cry
over
the
milk
you
spilled
at
manheimer
have
you
i
had
heard
the
witticism
from
him
more
than
once
before
so
had
some
of
the
other
men
present
nevertheless
he
now
delivered
it
with
gusto
and
it
was
received
with
a
hearty
roar
of
merriment
in
which
his
own
laughter
was
the
loudest
among
the
people
who
came
to
rejoice
in
my
success
were
some
whose
appearance
was
an
amusing
surprise
to
me
one
of
these
was
octavius
the
violinist
who
had
had
nothing
but
contempt
for
me
in
the
days
when
to
go
hours
without
food
was
a
usual
experience
with
me
he
had
scarcely
changed
he
entered
my
office
with
bohemian
glad
to
see
you
levinsky
i
was
glad
to
hear
of
your
rise
in
the
world
he
said
somewhat
pompously
i
ca
complain
either
though
however
our
fields
are
so
different
the
implication
was
that
while
i
had
succeeded
as
a
prosaic
pitiable
he
had
conquered
the
world
by
the
magic
of
his
violin
and
compositions
he
never
referred
to
olden
times
instead
he
boasted
of
his
successes
present
and
future
the
upshot
of
the
interview
was
that
i
sent
a
check
to
the
treasurer
of
the
free
conservatory
of
which
octavius
was
one
of
the
founders
i
was
elated
and
happy
but
there
was
a
fly
in
the
ointment
of
my
happiness
the
question
who
are
you
living
for
reverberated
through
the
four
vast
floors
of
my
factory
and
the
image
of
miss
tevkin
visited
me
again
and
again
marring
my
festive
mood
my
sense
of
triumph
often
clashed
with
a
feeling
of
and
yearning
the
rebuff
i
had
received
at
her
hands
in
the
afternoon
of
that
storm
lay
like
a
mosquito
in
my
soul
book
xiii
at
her
father
house
chapter
i
i
made
it
my
business
to
visit
a
hebrew
on
canal
street
i
asked
for
tevkin
works
it
appeared
that
before
he
emigrated
to
america
he
had
published
three
small
volumes
of
verse
and
prose
that
they
had
once
aroused
much
interest
but
that
they
were
now
practically
out
of
print
i
tried
two
other
stores
with
the
same
result
i
was
referred
to
the
astor
library
whose
hebrew
department
was
becoming
one
of
the
richest
in
the
world
sitting
down
in
a
public
library
to
read
a
book
seemed
to
be
an
undignified
proceeding
for
a
manufacturer
to
engage
in
but
my
curiosity
was
beyond
considerations
of
this
sort
whenever
i
thought
of
miss
tevkin
i
beheld
the
image
of
those
three
books
the
only
things
related
to
her
with
which
i
was
able
to
come
in
contact
finally
on
a
saturday
afternoon
i
found
myself
at
one
of
the
green
tables
of
astor
library
i
was
reading
poetry
written
in
the
holy
tongue
a
language
i
had
not
used
for
more
than
eighteen
years
two
of
tevkin
three
little
volumes
were
made
up
of
poetry
while
the
third
consisted
of
brief
essays
prose
poems
meditations
and
epigrams
i
came
across
a
meditation
entitled
my
children
and
took
it
up
eagerly
it
contained
but
three
sentences
my
children
love
me
yet
my
heart
is
hungry
they
are
mine
yet
they
are
strangers
i
am
homesick
for
them
even
when
i
clasp
them
to
my
bosom
the
next
meditation
on
the
same
page
had
the
word
poetry
for
its
the
children
of
israel
have
been
pent
up
in
cities
it
ran
the
stuffy
synagogue
has
been
field
and
forest
to
them
but
then
there
is
more
beauty
in
a
heaven
visioned
by
a
congregation
of
worshipers
than
in
the
bluest
heaven
sung
by
the
minstrel
of
landscapes
they
are
not
worshipers
they
are
poets
it
is
not
god
they
are
speaking
to
it
is
a
sublime
image
it
is
not
their
creator
it
is
their
poetic
creation
several
of
the
poems
were
dedicated
to
doctor
rachaeles
and
of
these
one
of
two
stanzas
seemed
to
contain
a
timid
allusion
to
tevkin
love
for
his
daughter
here
it
is
in
prosaic
english
saith
koheleth
the
son
of
david
the
rivers
run
into
the
sea
yet
the
sea
is
not
full
ah
the
rivers
are
flowing
and
flowing
yet
they
are
full
as
ever
and
my
lips
are
speaking
and
speaking
yet
my
heart
is
full
as
ever
behold
the
brook
is
murmuring
and
murmuring
but
i
know
not
of
what
my
heart
is
yearning
and
yearning
and
i
know
not
of
what
i
cherish
the
murmur
of
the
brook
i
cherish
the
pang
of
my
lonely
heart
the
following
lines
which
were
also
dedicated
to
doctor
rachaeles
and
which
were
entitled
night
betray
a
similar
mood
perhaps
without
distinctly
referring
to
the
poet
yearnings
hush
the
night
is
speaking
each
twinkle
of
a
star
is
a
word
from
the
world
beyond
it
is
the
language
of
men
who
were
once
here
but
are
no
more
a
thousand
generations
of
departed
souls
are
speaking
to
us
in
words
of
twinkling
stars
i
seem
to
be
one
of
them
i
hear
my
own
ghost
whispering
to
me
it
says
the
three
volumes
were
full
of
biblical
quaintness
and
my
estrangement
from
the
language
only
added
to
the
bizarre
effect
of
its
terse
grammatical
construction
i
read
a
number
of
the
poems
and
several
of
the
things
in
the
prose
volume
his
hebrew
is
truly
marvelous
and
much
of
the
strength
and
charm
of
his
message
is
bound
up
in
it
as
i
read
his
poetry
or
prose
i
seemed
to
be
listening
to
jeremiah
or
isaiah
the
rhythm
of
his
lines
is
not
the
only
thing
that
is
lost
in
my
translation
there
is
a
prehistoric
vigor
and
a
mystic
beauty
to
them
which
elude
the
english
at
my
command
to
be
sure
every
word
i
read
in
his
three
little
volumes
was
tinged
with
the
fact
that
the
author
was
the
father
of
the
girl
who
had
cast
her
spell
over
me
but
then
the
thought
that
she
had
grown
up
in
the
house
of
the
man
who
had
written
these
lines
intensified
the
glow
of
her
nimbus
as
i
returned
the
books
to
the
official
in
charge
of
the
hebrew
department
i
lingered
to
draw
him
into
conversation
he
was
a
member
of
the
east
side
bohčme
i
had
heard
of
him
as
a
man
who
spoke
several
languages
and
was
amazingly
well
read
a
walking
library
of
knowledge
not
only
of
books
but
also
of
men
and
things
accordingly
i
hoped
to
extract
from
him
some
information
about
tevkin
he
was
a
portly
man
with
a
round
youthful
face
and
a
baby
smile
he
smiled
far
more
than
he
spoke
he
answered
my
questions
either
by
some
laconic
phrase
or
by
leaving
me
for
a
minute
and
then
returning
with
some
book
pamphlet
or
in
which
he
pointed
out
a
passage
that
was
supposed
to
contain
a
reply
to
my
query
i
had
quite
a
long
talk
with
him
now
and
then
we
were
interrupted
by
some
one
asking
for
or
returning
a
book
but
each
time
he
was
released
he
readily
gave
me
his
attention
again
speaking
of
tevkin
i
inquired
why
does
he
write
some
more
of
those
things
for
an
answer
he
withdrew
and
soon
came
back
with
several
issues
of
the
pen
a
hebrew
weekly
published
in
new
york
in
which
he
showed
me
an
article
by
tevkin
have
you
read
it
i
asked
he
nodded
and
smiled
is
it
good
it
is
bad
he
answered
with
a
smile
not
as
good
as
the
things
in
those
three
volumes
he
smiled
this
kind
of
thing
does
pay
does
it
how
does
he
make
a
living
i
do
know
i
understand
he
has
several
grown
children
so
they
support
the
family
i
suppose
so
i
am
not
sure
though
ca
a
hebrew
writer
make
a
living
in
new
york
he
shook
his
head
and
smiled
the
dailies
of
the
ghetto
the
newspapers
that
can
afford
to
pay
are
published
not
in
the
language
of
isaiah
and
job
but
in
yiddish
the
german
dialect
spoken
by
the
jewish
masses
of
i
asked
the
librarian
whether
tevkin
wrote
for
those
papers
and
he
brought
me
several
clippings
containing
some
of
tevkin
yiddish
contributions
it
appeared
however
that
the
articles
he
wrote
in
his
living
lacked
the
spirit
and
the
charm
that
distinguished
his
style
when
he
used
the
language
of
the
prophets
altogether
tevkin
seemed
to
be
accounted
one
of
the
of
the
ghetto
one
of
the
bits
of
information
i
squeezed
out
of
the
librarian
was
that
tevkin
was
a
passionate
frequenter
of
yampolsky
café
a
of
the
east
side
bohčme
i
had
heard
a
good
deal
about
the
resort
i
knew
that
many
or
most
of
its
patrons
were
socialists
or
anarchists
or
some
other
kind
of
ists
after
my
experience
at
the
cooper
institute
meeting
yampolsky
café
seemed
to
be
the
last
place
in
the
world
for
me
to
visit
but
i
was
drawn
to
it
as
a
butterfly
is
to
a
flame
and
finally
the
temptation
got
the
better
of
me
chapter
ii
the
café
was
a
spacious
room
of
six
corners
and
a
general
appearance
it
was
about
of
an
afternoon
i
sat
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
tables
a
glass
of
russian
tea
before
me
there
were
two
other
customers
at
that
table
both
poorly
clad
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
two
tables
in
a
narrow
and
dingier
part
of
the
room
were
occupied
by
disheveled
and
three
or
four
altogether
there
were
about
fifteen
people
in
the
place
some
of
the
conversations
were
carried
on
aloud
a
man
with
curly
dark
hair
who
was
eating
soup
at
the
table
directly
in
front
of
me
was
satirizing
somebody
between
spoonfuls
relishing
his
acrimony
as
if
it
were
spice
to
his
soup
a
feminine
voice
back
of
me
was
trying
to
prove
to
somebody
that
she
did
much
more
for
her
sister
than
her
sister
did
for
her
i
was
wretchedly
ill
at
ease
at
first
i
loathed
myself
for
being
here
i
felt
like
one
who
had
strayed
into
a
disreputable
den
in
addition
i
was
in
dread
of
being
recognized
the
man
who
sat
by
my
side
had
the
hair
and
the
complexion
of
a
gipsy
he
looked
exhausted
and
morose
presently
he
had
a
fried
steak
served
him
it
was
heavily
laden
with
onions
as
he
fell
to
cutting
and
eating
it
hungrily
the
odor
of
the
fried
onions
and
the
sound
of
his
lips
sickened
me
the
steak
put
him
in
good
humor
he
became
sociable
and
turned
out
to
be
a
gay
though
a
venomous
fellow
his
small
talk
raised
my
spirits
too
nor
did
anybody
in
the
café
seem
to
know
who
i
was
or
to
take
any
notice
of
me
i
took
a
humorous
view
of
the
situation
and
had
the
man
tell
me
who
was
who
shall
i
begin
with
this
great
man
he
asked
facetiously
pointing
his
fork
at
himself
i
am
the
translator
and
feuilleton
writer
whose
writings
have
greatly
increased
the
circulation
of
the
yiddish
tribune
under
the
guise
of
playful
vanity
he
gave
vent
to
a
torrent
of
he
then
named
all
the
other
notables
present
a
poet
a
cartoonist
a
budding
playwright
a
distinguished
russian
revolutionist
an
editor
and
another
newspaper
man
maligning
and
deriding
some
of
them
and
grudgingly
praising
the
others
much
of
what
he
said
was
lost
upon
me
for
although
he
knew
that
i
was
a
rank
outsider
he
used
a
jargon
of
nicknames
and
allusions
that
was
apparently
peculiar
to
the
east
side
bohčme
he
was
part
of
that
little
world
and
he
was
unable
to
put
himself
in
the
place
of
one
who
was
not
i
subsequently
had
occasion
to
read
one
of
his
articles
and
i
found
it
full
of
the
same
jargon
the
public
did
not
understand
him
but
he
either
did
not
know
it
or
did
not
care
as
he
did
not
point
out
tevkin
to
me
i
concluded
that
the
hebrew
poet
was
not
at
the
café
do
you
know
tevkin
i
inquired
there
he
is
he
answered
directing
my
glance
to
a
man
of
medium
stature
who
stood
in
the
chess
corner
watching
one
of
the
games
do
you
know
him
no
but
i
have
heard
of
him
you
did
not
include
him
in
your
list
of
notables
did
you
oh
well
he
was
a
notable
once
upon
a
time
our
rule
is
the
dead
past
bury
it
dead
i
felt
sorry
for
poor
tevkin
turning
around
in
my
seat
i
took
to
eying
the
hebrew
poet
i
felt
disappointed
that
this
old
man
should
have
written
the
lines
that
i
had
read
at
the
astor
library
seemed
inconceivable
the
fact
however
that
he
was
the
father
of
the
tall
stately
beautiful
girl
whose
image
was
ever
before
me
ennobled
his
face
i
stepped
over
to
him
and
said
you
are
tevkin
are
you
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
levinsky
he
bowed
grasping
my
hand
evidently
loath
to
take
his
eyes
off
the
i
read
some
of
your
poems
the
other
day
i
added
my
poems
he
asked
coloring
yes
i
had
heard
of
them
and
as
i
happened
to
be
at
the
astor
library
i
asked
for
your
three
volumes
i
read
several
things
in
each
of
them
i
liked
them
tremendously
he
blushed
again
it
seems
an
age
since
they
were
written
he
said
in
confusion
those
were
different
days
we
sat
down
at
a
secluded
table
to
propitiate
the
proprietor
and
the
waiter
i
ordered
hot
i
offered
to
order
something
for
tevkin
but
he
declined
and
he
ordered
a
glass
of
tea
with
the
tacit
understanding
that
he
was
to
pay
for
it
himself
why
do
you
give
us
some
more
poems
like
those
he
produced
his
business
card
saying
this
is
the
kind
of
poetry
that
goes
in
america
the
card
described
him
as
a
general
business
agent
and
broker
this
meant
that
he
earned
or
tried
to
earn
an
income
by
acting
as
broker
for
people
who
wanted
to
sell
or
buy
stands
laundries
butcher
shops
and
what
not
from
a
peddier
to
a
parcel
of
real
estate
or
an
interest
in
a
small
factory
scores
of
stores
and
stands
change
hands
in
the
ghetto
every
day
the
purchaser
being
usually
a
workman
who
has
saved
up
some
money
with
an
eye
to
business
does
it
pay
i
ventured
to
ask
i
am
not
in
it
merely
for
the
fun
of
it
am
i
he
returned
somewhat
resentfully
business
is
business
and
poetry
is
poetry
i
hate
to
confound
the
two
one
must
make
a
living
thank
god
i
know
how
to
look
things
in
the
face
i
am
no
dreamer
it
is
sweet
to
earn
your
livelihood
of
course
it
is
still
dreaming
is
no
crime
either
ah
that
another
kind
of
dreaming
do
you
write
oh
no
i
said
with
a
laugh
i
am
just
a
prosaic
business
man
and
by
way
of
showing
that
i
was
not
i
veered
the
conversation
back
to
his
poetry
i
sought
to
impress
him
with
a
sense
of
my
deep
and
critical
appreciation
of
what
i
had
read
in
his
three
volumes
i
spoke
enthusiastically
of
most
of
it
but
took
exception
to
the
basic
idea
in
a
poem
on
job
and
solomon
it
fine
as
poetry
i
said
some
lines
in
it
are
perfectly
beautiful
but
the
parallel
is
not
convincing
why
not
he
said
bristling
up
we
locked
horns
he
was
pugnacious
bitter
but
ineffectual
he
quoted
hebrew
he
spoke
partly
in
yiddish
and
partly
in
english
he
repeatedly
used
the
words
subjective
and
objective
he
dwelt
on
job
obvious
tragedy
and
solomon
inner
sadness
but
he
was
a
poor
talker
and
apparently
displeased
with
his
own
argument
oh
i
do
make
myself
clear
he
said
in
despair
but
you
do
i
reassured
him
i
understand
you
perfectly
no
you
do
you
only
saying
it
to
please
me
but
then
what
matters
it
whether
a
business
agent
has
a
correct
conception
of
solomon
psychology
or
not
he
said
bitterly
seriously
levinsky
i
am
often
out
of
sorts
with
myself
for
hanging
around
this
café
this
is
the
of
talent
not
of
business
agents
why
why
i
tried
to
console
him
i
am
sure
you
have
more
talent
than
all
of
them
put
together
do
you
think
anybody
in
this
café
could
write
verse
or
prose
like
yours
he
looked
down
his
features
hardening
into
a
frown
anyhow
i
can
not
afford
the
time
while
i
loiter
here
i
am
liable
to
miss
a
customer
i
must
give
myself
entirely
to
my
business
entirely
entirely
every
bit
of
myself
i
must
forget
i
ever
did
any
scribbling
you
are
taking
it
too
hard
tevkin
one
can
attend
to
business
and
yet
find
time
for
writing
all
at
once
he
brightened
up
bashfully
and
took
to
reciting
a
hebrew
poem
here
is
the
essence
of
it
since
the
destruction
of
the
temple
instrumental
music
has
been
forbidden
in
the
synagogues
the
children
of
israel
are
in
mourning
they
are
in
exile
and
in
mourning
silent
is
their
harp
so
is
mine
i
am
in
exile
i
am
in
a
strange
land
my
harp
is
silent
is
it
your
poem
i
asked
he
nodded
bashfully
when
did
you
compose
it
a
few
weeks
ago
has
it
been
printed
he
shook
his
head
why
i
could
have
it
printed
in
a
hebrew
weekly
we
publish
here
but
well
i
did
not
care
to
you
mean
the
pen
yes
do
you
see
it
sometimes
i
did
once
i
am
going
to
subscribe
for
it
anyhow
the
poem
belies
itself
it
shows
that
your
harp
has
not
fallen
silent
he
smiled
flushed
with
satisfaction
like
a
shy
schoolboy
and
proceeded
to
recite
another
hebrew
poem
most
do
not
sing
in
captivity
i
was
once
a
but
america
is
my
cage
it
is
not
my
home
my
song
is
gone
this
poem
too
gives
itself
the
lie
i
declared
but
the
idea
of
america
being
likened
to
a
prison
it
is
of
my
soul
i
speak
he
said
resentfully
russia
did
not
imprison
it
did
it
russia
is
a
better
country
than
america
anyhow
even
if
she
is
oppressed
by
a
czar
it
a
freer
country
too
for
the
spirit
at
least
there
is
more
poetry
there
more
music
more
feeling
even
if
our
people
do
suffer
appalling
persecution
the
russian
people
are
really
a
people
besides
one
enjoys
life
in
russia
better
than
here
oh
a
thousand
times
better
there
is
too
much
materialism
here
too
much
hurry
and
too
much
prose
and
yes
too
much
machinery
it
all
very
well
to
make
shoes
or
bread
by
machinery
but
alas
the
things
of
the
spirit
too
seem
to
be
in
america
if
my
younger
children
were
not
so
attached
to
this
country
and
did
not
love
it
so
and
if
i
could
make
a
living
in
russia
now
i
should
be
ready
to
go
back
at
once
ye
comfort
ye
my
people
saith
your
god
i
quoted
gaily
it
all
a
matter
of
mood
poets
are
men
of
moods
and
again
i
quoted
unto
me
o
my
friend
and
give
ear
unto
me
o
my
comrade
i
took
up
the
cudgels
for
america
he
listened
gloomily
leaving
my
arguments
unanswered
by
way
of
broaching
the
subject
of
his
daughter
i
steered
my
talk
to
a
point
that
gave
me
a
chance
to
refer
to
his
little
meditation
my
children
how
well
you
do
remember
my
poor
little
volumes
he
said
greatly
flattered
yes
children
love
me
they
are
not
children
but
angels
and
yet
god
save
me
from
having
to
be
supported
by
them
they
bring
in
a
considerable
sum
at
the
end
of
the
week
and
they
hate
to
see
me
work
or
worry
but
oh
how
sweet
it
is
to
earn
own
living
thank
god
i
do
earn
my
share
and
my
wife
my
children
are
bitterly
opposed
to
it
they
beg
me
to
stay
home
but
i
say
children
mine
as
long
as
your
father
can
earn
his
bread
his
bread
he
will
earn
that
why
my
humdrum
occupation
is
so
sweet
to
me
at
this
he
lowered
his
eyes
and
said
with
the
embarrassed
simper
which
seemed
to
accompany
every
remark
of
his
that
implied
i
wrote
something
on
this
subject
the
other
day
just
a
line
or
two
are
instances
when
the
jewel
of
poetry
glints
out
of
the
prose
of
trade
the
fact
that
his
children
contributed
to
the
maintenance
of
the
family
nest
was
evidently
a
sore
spot
in
his
heart
his
face
sensitive
and
mobile
in
the
extreme
was
like
a
cinematographic
film
it
recorded
the
subtlest
change
in
his
mood
the
notion
of
its
being
a
commonplace
face
seemed
to
me
absurd
now
it
was
a
different
image
almost
every
minute
and
my
mental
portrait
of
it
was
as
unlike
my
first
impression
of
it
as
a
motion
picture
is
unlike
any
of
its
component
photographs
i
parted
from
him
without
referring
to
his
daughter
but
i
felt
that
i
had
won
his
heart
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
matter
of
days
when
he
would
invite
me
to
his
house
the
next
time
i
saw
him
on
an
afternoon
at
yampolsky
café
again
there
was
an
elusive
deference
in
his
demeanor
he
seemed
to
me
more
reserved
and
ill
at
ease
than
he
had
been
on
the
previous
occasion
finally
he
said
i
had
no
idea
you
were
david
levinsky
the
my
vanity
was
so
flattered
that
i
was
unable
to
restrain
my
face
from
betraying
it
i
answered
with
a
beaming
smile
i
told
you
i
was
in
the
cloak
business
did
i
i
do
think
you
did
anyhow
i
did
not
know
what
kind
of
a
yours
was
he
said
what
kind
do
you
mean
i
laughed
well
i
am
glad
to
know
you
are
so
successful
there
was
somebody
who
recognized
you
last
time
you
were
here
your
secret
leaked
out
secret
well
what
difference
does
it
all
make
to
possess
a
talent
like
yours
is
a
far
greater
success
than
to
own
a
factory
even
if
mine
were
the
largest
in
the
world
he
waved
his
hand
deprecatingly
our
conversation
was
disturbed
by
a
quarrel
between
two
men
at
a
table
i
was
at
a
loss
to
make
out
what
it
was
all
about
tevkin
attempted
to
enlighten
me
but
i
listened
to
him
only
partly
being
interested
in
the
darts
of
the
two
belligerents
all
i
could
gather
was
that
they
were
of
two
opposing
schools
i
felt
however
that
their
hostility
was
based
upon
professional
jealousy
rather
than
upon
a
divergence
of
artistic
ideals
finally
one
of
them
paid
his
check
and
departed
tevkin
told
me
more
about
them
he
spoke
of
the
one
who
stayed
in
the
café
with
admiration
he
a
real
artist
some
of
his
stories
are
perfect
gems
he
said
he
a
good
fellow
too
only
he
thinks
too
much
of
himself
but
then
perhaps
this
is
an
inevitable
part
of
talent
the
shadow
that
is
inseparable
from
the
light
of
genius
perhaps
it
the
engine
that
sets
it
in
motion
gives
it
incentive
perhaps
i
wish
i
had
some
of
it
i
reflected
that
he
did
seem
to
have
some
of
it
at
all
events
he
did
not
seem
to
begrudge
others
their
success
he
spoke
of
the
other
people
in
the
café
with
singular
and
even
enthusiasm
in
fact
some
of
the
people
present
i
had
seen
on
my
previous
visit
of
the
others
tevkin
pointed
out
a
man
to
me
who
knew
six
languages
well
and
had
a
working
acquaintance
with
several
more
another
who
had
published
an
excellent
hebrew
translation
of
some
of
the
english
poets
and
a
third
whose
son
a
young
violinist
had
taken
europe
by
storm
an
gentile
made
his
entry
he
shook
hands
with
one
of
the
men
i
had
seen
on
the
former
occasion
and
seated
himself
by
his
side
either
a
journalist
in
search
of
material
tevkin
explained
to
me
in
answer
to
a
question
or
simply
a
man
of
literary
tastes
who
is
drawn
to
the
atmosphere
of
this
place
the
café
rose
in
my
estimation
i
learned
from
tevkin
that
many
of
yampolsky
patrons
were
poor
and
that
some
of
these
were
poets
writers
of
stories
or
thinkers
but
that
the
café
was
also
frequented
by
some
professional
and
business
men
at
this
he
directed
my
attention
to
a
man
whom
he
described
as
a
who
would
be
a
celebrated
writer
if
he
were
not
worth
half
a
million
the
last
piece
of
information
was
a
most
agreeable
surprise
to
me
it
made
me
feel
safe
in
the
place
i
regarded
the
with
some
contempt
however
pshaw
half
a
million
he
probably
worth
a
good
deal
less
anyhow
i
could
buy
and
sell
him
at
the
same
time
i
said
to
myself
he
and
yet
he
chums
around
with
people
in
whom
intellectual
gentiles
take
an
interest
i
envied
him
i
felt
cheap
i
felt
still
cheaper
when
i
heard
that
the
literary
generously
contributed
to
the
maintenance
of
the
pen
the
hebrew
weekly
with
which
tevkin
was
connected
and
that
he
the
wrote
for
that
publication
it
appeared
that
tevkin
had
an
office
which
was
a
short
distance
from
the
bohemian
café
i
asked
to
see
it
and
he
yielded
reluctantly
you
can
take
it
for
granted
that
your
office
is
a
more
imposing
one
than
mine
he
jested
ah
but
there
was
a
time
when
all
my
office
amounted
to
was
an
old
desk
so
there
will
be
a
time
when
yours
will
occupy
a
splendid
building
on
wall
street
that
far
more
than
i
aspire
to
all
i
want
is
to
make
a
modest
living
so
that
my
daughters
should
not
have
to
go
to
work
they
do
work
in
a
shop
of
course
one
is
a
stenographer
in
a
fine
office
and
the
other
a
but
what
difference
does
it
make
his
office
proved
to
be
the
hall
bedroom
of
an
apartment
occupied
by
the
family
of
a
cantor
named
wolpert
we
first
entered
the
a
door
connecting
it
with
tevkin
office
being
wide
open
it
was
late
and
the
was
burning
seated
at
a
large
oval
table
covered
with
a
white
was
wolpert
and
two
other
men
all
the
three
of
them
with
full
beards
and
with
the
stamp
of
intellectual
life
on
their
faces
there
are
some
queer
people
in
the
world
who
will
still
read
my
poetry
tevkin
said
to
them
by
way
of
introducing
me
here
is
one
of
them
levinsky
david
levinsky
the
the
announcement
made
something
of
a
stir
wolpert
brought
us
tea
from
the
ensuing
conversation
i
gleaned
that
these
people
including
tevkin
were
ardent
zionists
of
a
certain
type
and
that
they
were
part
of
a
group
in
which
the
poet
was
a
ruling
spirit
when
i
happened
to
drop
a
remark
to
the
effect
that
hebrew
the
language
of
the
old
testament
was
a
dead
language
wolpert
exclaimed
oh
no
not
any
longer
levinsky
it
has
risen
from
the
dead
the
other
two
chimed
in
each
in
his
way
the
burden
of
their
argument
being
that
hebrew
was
the
living
tongue
of
the
zionist
colonists
in
palestine
the
children
of
our
colonists
speak
it
as
american
children
do
english
said
tevkin
exultingly
they
speak
it
as
the
sons
and
daughters
of
jerusalem
spoke
it
at
the
time
of
the
prophets
we
are
no
dreamers
we
can
tell
the
difference
between
a
dream
and
a
hard
fact
ca
we
to
the
other
two
for
centuries
the
tongue
of
our
fathers
spoke
from
the
grave
to
us
now
however
it
has
come
to
life
again
he
took
me
into
his
office
lighting
the
in
it
a
few
minutes
later
he
shut
the
door
his
face
assuming
an
extremely
grave
mien
by
the
way
an
idea
has
occurred
to
me
he
said
but
first
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
do
not
mean
to
profit
by
our
spiritual
friendship
for
purposes
of
a
material
nature
do
you
believe
me
i
certainly
do
go
ahead
mr
tevkin
what
i
want
to
say
is
a
pure
matter
of
business
do
you
understand
if
you
do
want
to
go
into
it
just
say
so
and
we
shall
drop
it
of
course
i
answered
we
were
unable
to
look
each
other
in
the
face
there
is
a
parcel
of
real
estate
in
brooklyn
he
resumed
one
could
have
it
for
a
song
but
i
do
buy
real
estate
i
replied
my
cheeks
on
fire
he
looked
at
the
floor
and
after
a
moment
silence
he
said
all
excuse
me
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
want
to
presume
upon
our
acquaintance
but
i
do
on
the
contrary
i
wish
it
were
in
my
line
i
should
be
glad
to
that
all
he
cut
me
short
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
and
he
made
an
awkward
effort
to
talk
zionism
again
chapter
iii
the
boom
which
had
seized
upon
the
five
ghettos
of
greater
new
york
a
few
years
before
was
still
intoxicating
a
certain
element
of
their
population
small
tradesmen
of
the
slums
and
even
were
investing
their
savings
in
houses
and
lots
jewish
carpenters
bricklayers
or
instalment
peddlers
became
builders
of
tenements
or
frame
dwellings
speculators
deals
were
being
closed
and
poor
men
were
making
thousands
of
dollars
in
less
time
than
it
took
them
to
drink
the
glass
of
tea
or
the
plate
of
sorrel
soup
over
which
the
transaction
took
place
women
too
were
ardently
dabbling
in
real
estate
and
one
of
them
was
chaikin
the
wife
of
my
talented
designer
tevkin
was
not
the
first
broker
to
offer
me
a
good
thing
in
real
estate
attempts
in
that
direction
had
been
made
before
and
i
had
warded
them
all
off
instinct
told
me
not
to
let
my
attention
be
diverted
from
my
regular
business
to
what
i
considered
a
gamble
unreal
estate
i
would
call
it
my
friend
nodelman
was
of
the
same
opinion
it
a
poker
game
traveling
under
a
false
passport
was
his
way
of
putting
it
once
as
i
sat
in
a
brooklyn
i
was
accosted
by
a
bewigged
woman
who
occupied
the
next
seat
and
whom
i
had
never
seen
before
you
speak
yiddish
do
you
she
began
after
scrutinizing
me
quite
unceremoniously
i
do
why
i
just
wanted
to
know
is
that
all
well
it
is
and
it
is
not
she
said
with
a
shrewd
smile
since
we
are
talking
i
might
as
well
ask
you
if
you
would
not
care
to
take
a
look
at
a
couple
of
new
houses
in
east
new
york
i
did
not
interrupt
her
and
she
proceeded
to
describe
the
houses
and
the
bargain
they
represented
when
she
finally
paused
for
my
answer
and
i
perpetrated
a
labored
witticism
about
her
peddling
real
estate
in
she
flared
up
why
not
is
it
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
or
to
hide
did
i
steal
those
houses
i
can
assure
you
i
paid
good
money
for
them
so
why
should
i
be
afraid
to
speak
about
them
and
when
i
say
it
is
a
bargain
i
mean
it
that
too
i
can
say
aloud
and
to
everybody
in
the
world
because
it
is
the
truth
the
holy
truth
may
i
not
live
to
see
my
children
again
if
it
is
not
there
after
a
pause
she
resumed
well
i
made
no
reply
will
you
come
along
and
see
the
houses
it
is
not
far
from
here
i
have
no
time
she
took
up
some
details
tending
to
show
that
by
buying
those
two
frame
buildings
of
hers
and
selling
them
again
i
was
sure
to
clear
a
profit
of
ten
thousand
dollars
i
made
no
reply
well
will
you
come
along
leave
me
alone
please
ah
you
are
angry
are
you
she
said
sneeringly
is
it
because
you
have
any
money
the
awkward
scene
that
had
attended
tevkin
attempt
to
get
me
interested
in
his
parcel
haunted
me
i
craved
to
see
him
again
and
to
let
him
sell
me
something
to
be
sure
my
chief
motive
was
a
desire
to
cultivate
his
friendship
to
increase
my
chances
of
being
invited
to
his
house
the
risk
of
buying
some
city
lots
in
brooklyn
seemed
to
be
a
trifling
price
to
pay
for
the
prospect
of
coming
into
closer
relations
with
him
besides
the
parcel
seemed
to
be
a
sure
investment
but
i
was
also
eager
to
do
something
for
him
for
his
own
sake
and
so
i
made
an
appointment
with
him
by
telephone
and
called
at
his
wretched
little
office
again
where
is
the
parcel
you
mentioned
the
other
day
i
began
where
is
it
located
never
mind
that
he
said
hotly
there
shall
be
no
business
between
you
and
me
nothing
but
pure
spiritual
friendship
i
made
a
foolish
mistake
last
time
i
hate
myself
for
it
if
you
were
a
smaller
man
financially
i
should
not
mind
it
perhaps
as
it
is
it
would
simply
mean
that
you
help
me
out
it
would
mean
charity
i
laughed
and
argued
and
insisted
and
he
succumbed
we
made
an
appointment
to
meet
at
malbin
a
large
restaurant
on
grand
street
that
was
known
as
the
real
estate
exchange
of
the
ghetto
there
i
was
introduced
to
a
man
who
proved
to
be
the
then
owner
of
the
parcel
and
closed
a
contract
for
a
deed
encouraged
by
this
transaction
tevkin
rapidly
developed
some
projects
in
which
he
apparently
expected
me
to
be
the
central
figure
one
afternoon
as
we
sat
over
glasses
of
tea
at
malbin
he
said
if
you
want
to
drink
a
glass
of
real
russian
tea
come
up
some
evening
we
shall
all
be
very
glad
to
see
you
i
felt
the
color
mounting
to
my
face
as
i
said
i
do
think
your
daughter
would
like
it
my
daughter
he
asked
in
amazement
but
i
have
three
daughters
the
one
that
spent
some
time
at
the
rigi
kulm
in
the
catskills
last
summer
anna
he
asked
with
still
greater
surprise
as
it
were
i
do
know
her
first
name
but
i
suppose
that
the
one
if
she
was
at
the
rigi
kulm
it
anna
well
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
her
there
but
i
am
afraid
i
was
somewhat
of
a
persona
non
grata
with
her
i
said
in
a
partial
attempt
to
make
a
joke
of
it
he
dropped
his
glance
leveled
it
at
me
once
more
and
dropped
it
again
why
what
was
the
matter
he
inquired
in
great
embarrassment
nothing
was
the
matter
a
case
of
dislike
at
first
sight
i
suppose
still
you
better
ask
her
mr
tevkin
he
made
no
reply
nor
did
he
repeat
his
invitation
he
was
manifestly
on
pins
and
needles
to
get
away
without
having
the
courage
to
do
so
so
that
what
you
wanted
to
meet
me
for
he
muttered
looking
at
the
wall
well
i
tell
you
frankly
how
it
was
tevkin
i
said
and
began
with
a
partial
lie
calculated
to
bribe
him
i
became
interested
in
her
because
i
heard
that
she
was
your
daughter
and
afterward
when
i
had
returned
to
the
city
i
made
it
my
business
to
go
to
the
library
and
to
read
your
works
my
enthusiasm
for
your
writings
is
genuine
however
i
assure
you
tevkin
and
when
i
went
to
that
café
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
your
acquaintance
as
much
for
your
own
sake
as
for
hers
there
i
have
told
you
the
whole
story
there
was
mixed
satisfaction
and
perplexity
in
his
look
the
next
morning
my
mail
included
a
letter
from
him
it
was
penned
in
hebrew
it
read
like
a
chapter
of
the
old
testament
he
pointed
out
with
exquisite
tact
that
it
was
merely
as
a
courtier
that
i
had
failed
to
find
favor
in
his
eyes
something
that
is
purely
a
matter
of
taste
and
chance
he
then
went
on
to
intimate
that
if
the
unfortunate
little
situation
rendered
it
at
all
inconvenient
for
me
to
visit
his
house
he
did
not
see
why
he
and
i
could
not
continue
our
friendly
relations
if
i
have
found
as
much
grace
in
thine
eyes
as
thou
hast
found
in
mine
he
wrote
it
would
pain
me
to
forfeit
thy
friendship
let
the
unpleasant
incident
be
forgotten
then
i
have
a
very
important
business
proposition
to
make
but
should
it
fail
to
arouse
thine
interest
why
then
let
all
business
too
be
eliminated
and
let
our
bond
be
one
of
unalloyed
friendship
i
have
been
hungry
for
a
for
years
and
in
thee
i
have
found
one
at
last
shall
i
be
estranged
from
thee
for
external
causes
whereupon
he
went
into
raptures
over
a
prospective
company
of
which
he
wanted
me
to
be
a
leading
shareholder
companies
or
combines
of
this
sort
were
then
being
formed
on
the
east
side
by
the
score
and
some
of
them
were
said
to
be
reaping
fabulous
profits
my
hebrew
which
had
never
been
perfect
for
the
talmud
is
chiefly
in
chaldaic
and
aramaic
was
by
now
quite
out
of
gear
so
my
answer
was
framed
partly
in
yiddish
but
mostly
in
english
the
english
being
tacitly
intended
for
his
daughter
although
he
understood
the
language
perfectly
i
said
in
substance
that
i
was
going
to
be
as
frank
as
he
was
that
i
did
not
propose
to
invest
more
money
in
real
estate
and
that
i
asked
to
be
allowed
to
call
on
his
daughter
the
following
passage
was
entirely
in
english
i
have
made
a
misleading
impression
on
miss
tevkin
i
have
done
myself
a
great
injustice
and
i
beg
for
a
chance
to
repair
the
damage
in
business
i
am
said
to
know
how
to
show
my
goods
to
their
best
advantage
unfortunately
this
instinct
seems
often
to
desert
me
in
private
life
there
i
am
apt
to
put
my
least
attractive
wares
in
the
to
expose
some
unlovable
trait
of
my
character
while
whatever
good
there
may
be
in
me
eludes
the
eye
of
a
superficial
acquaintance
please
assure
your
daughter
that
it
is
not
to
force
my
attentions
upon
her
that
i
am
asking
for
an
interview
all
i
want
is
to
try
to
convince
her
that
her
image
of
me
is
spiritually
speaking
not
a
good
likeness
two
days
passed
in
the
morning
of
the
third
i
received
a
from
tevkin
asking
to
meet
me
impelled
by
a
desire
to
impress
him
with
my
importance
i
invited
him
to
my
place
of
business
when
he
came
i
designedly
kept
him
in
my
for
some
minutes
before
i
received
him
when
he
was
finally
admitted
to
my
private
office
he
faced
me
with
studied
indifference
he
said
he
had
only
a
minute
time
yet
he
stayed
nearly
an
hour
he
asked
me
to
come
to
his
house
he
spoke
guardedly
giving
vague
answers
to
my
questions
the
best
i
could
make
of
his
explanation
was
that
his
daughter
had
been
prejudiced
against
me
by
the
fact
that
everybody
at
the
rigi
kulm
had
looked
upon
me
as
a
great
matrimonial
catch
mv
children
have
extremely
modern
ideas
he
said
ones
his
face
brightened
and
he
added
the
old
rule
is
is
no
disgrace
their
rule
is
is
a
disgrace
and
he
flushed
and
burst
into
a
little
laugh
of
approbation
at
his
own
epigram
i
suppose
your
daughter
regarded
me
as
a
parvenu
an
upstart
an
ignoramus
i
remarked
no
not
at
all
she
says
she
heard
you
say
some
clever
things
did
she
still
your
letter
was
a
surprise
to
her
she
had
not
thought
you
capable
of
writing
such
things
what
really
had
occurred
between
father
and
daughter
concerning
my
desire
to
call
i
never
learned
tevkin
house
was
apparently
full
of
socialism
indeed
so
was
the
house
of
almost
every
intellectual
family
among
our
immigrants
i
hated
and
dreaded
that
world
as
much
as
ever
and
i
dreaded
miss
tevkin
more
than
ever
but
i
was
drawn
to
the
flame
with
greater
and
greater
force
i
went
to
the
with
the
feeling
of
one
going
to
his
doom
chapter
iv
the
family
occupied
a
large
old
private
house
in
the
harlem
section
of
fifth
avenue
a
locality
swarming
with
our
people
i
called
at
in
the
evening
it
was
in
the
latter
part
of
march
nearly
eight
months
after
my
unfortunate
experience
in
the
catskills
i
was
received
in
the
hall
by
tevkin
he
took
me
into
a
spacious
parlor
whose
walls
were
lined
with
old
and
there
i
found
anna
and
two
of
the
other
children
of
the
numerous
family
she
wore
a
blouse
of
green
velvet
and
a
black
tie
she
welcomed
me
with
a
cordial
handshake
and
a
gay
smile
as
though
all
that
had
transpired
between
us
had
been
a
childish
misunderstanding
but
she
was
ill
at
ease
as
for
me
i
was
literally
it
was
at
this
moment
when
i
came
face
to
face
with
her
for
the
first
time
in
the
eight
months
following
that
catskill
incident
that
i
became
aware
of
being
definitely
in
love
with
her
the
and
were
full
to
bursting
there
was
a
piano
in
the
room
and
two
tables
littered
with
books
prints
and
photographs
the
space
between
and
over
the
piano
was
hung
with
etchings
crayons
drawings
and
photographs
the
other
two
of
tevkin
children
present
were
a
chubby
girl
of
twelve
named
gracie
and
a
young
man
of
two
or
three
years
older
than
anna
named
sasha
sasha
had
a
in
an
evening
preparatory
school
in
which
he
taught
mathematics
being
now
confined
to
the
house
by
a
slight
indisposition
tevkin
made
her
appearance
a
handsome
old
woman
of
striking
presence
tall
almost
majestic
with
a
mass
of
white
hair
with
the
beautiful
features
of
the
girl
who
was
the
cause
of
my
being
there
i
thought
of
naphtali
i
had
a
desire
to
discover
his
address
and
to
write
him
about
my
meeting
with
the
hero
and
heroine
of
the
romance
of
which
he
had
told
me
a
few
months
before
i
left
antomir
i
go
to
their
house
she
is
still
beautiful
i
pictured
myself
saying
to
him
her
demeanor
and
the
very
intonation
of
her
speech
seemed
to
proclaim
the
fact
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
that
illustrious
physician
of
odessa
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
discover
however
that
under
the
surface
of
her
good
breeding
and
refinement
was
a
woman
of
scant
intellect
seeing
me
look
at
the
she
said
these
are
not
all
the
books
we
have
there
are
some
in
the
other
rooms
too
plenty
of
them
it
quite
a
job
for
an
american
to
dust
them
anna
smiled
the
next
utterance
of
tevkin
was
to
the
effect
that
one
had
to
put
up
with
crowded
quarters
in
america
a
hint
at
the
better
days
which
the
family
had
seen
in
russia
anna
younger
sister
elsie
a
came
in
she
had
quicker
movements
and
a
sharper
look
than
the
stenographer
and
she
bore
strong
resemblance
to
her
father
anna
was
the
prettier
of
the
two
we
went
down
into
the
where
we
found
russian
tea
cake
and
preserves
presently
we
were
joined
by
george
an
who
was
between
anna
and
sasha
and
emil
an
artist
employed
on
a
sunday
paper
who
was
between
anna
and
elsie
emil
was
a
handsome
fellow
with
a
picturesque
face
which
betrayed
his
vocation
the
crayons
and
the
drawings
that
i
had
seen
in
the
library
were
his
work
he
had
a
pale
high
forehead
and
a
thick
upright
grove
of
very
soft
brown
hair
which
i
pictured
as
billowing
in
a
breeze
like
a
field
of
rye
just
the
kind
of
son
for
a
poet
to
have
i
thought
there
was
another
son
moissey
he
was
married
and
i
did
not
see
him
that
evening
his
mother
was
continually
referring
to
him
i
can
see
that
you
miss
him
i
said
i
should
say
so
anna
broke
in
he
her
pet
do
mind
what
she
says
levinsky
her
mother
exhorted
me
she
just
loves
to
tease
me
mother
is
right
elsie
interposed
moissey
is
not
her
pet
lf
somebody
is
it
i
is
it
ma
anna
smiled
gracie
is
my
pet
tevkin
rejoined
gracie
and
moissey
both
tevkin
amended
moissey
is
her
do
you
know
but
the
great
point
is
that
he
has
been
married
only
three
months
and
she
has
not
yet
got
used
to
having
him
live
somewhere
else
she
feels
as
if
somebody
had
snatched
him
from
her
when
a
day
passes
without
her
seeing
him
she
is
uneasy
not
at
all
tevkin
demurred
i
am
thinking
of
him
just
now
because
because
well
because
we
have
all
been
introduced
to
levinsky
except
him
if
two
or
three
of
the
family
were
missing
it
would
be
so
marked
tevkin
supported
her
chivalrously
but
only
one
is
missing
only
one
that
somehow
makes
you
think
of
him
i
feel
the
same
way
as
he
spoke
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
his
home
atmosphere
he
bore
himself
with
more
and
repose
than
at
the
café
or
at
his
office
his
hospitality
had
made
him
ill
at
ease
at
first
but
that
had
worn
off
you
can
depend
on
father
to
find
some
defense
for
mother
remarked
the
picturesque
emil
at
her
husband
suggestion
and
after
some
urging
the
hostess
led
the
way
back
to
the
parlor
or
library
where
she
was
to
play
us
something
as
we
were
passing
out
of
the
and
up
the
stairs
tevkin
seized
the
opportunity
to
say
to
me
we
live
on
the
communistic
principle
as
you
see
each
of
us
except
tevkin
and
the
little
one
contributes
his
earnings
or
part
of
them
to
the
general
treasury
my
wife
acting
as
treasurer
and
manager
still
in
the
near
future
i
hope
to
be
able
to
turn
the
commune
into
a
family
of
the
good
old
type
my
affairs
are
making
headway
thank
god
i
need
my
children
contributions
much
longer
tevkin
played
some
classical
pieces
she
had
a
pleasing
tone
and
apparently
felt
at
home
at
the
keyboard
but
it
was
to
my
eye
rather
than
to
my
ear
that
her
playing
appealed
a
jewish
woman
at
a
piano
was
something
which
in
antomir
had
been
associated
in
my
mind
with
the
life
of
the
highest
aristocracy
exclusively
but
then
tevkin
father
had
been
a
physician
and
jewish
physicians
belonged
in
the
conception
of
my
childhood
and
youth
to
the
highest
social
level
another
mark
of
her
noble
birth
according
to
my
antomir
ideas
was
the
fact
that
she
often
addressed
her
husband
and
her
older
children
not
in
yiddish
or
english
but
in
russian
compared
to
her
mother
was
a
plebeian
the
only
other
person
in
the
family
who
played
the
piano
with
facility
and
confidence
was
emil
i
had
never
been
in
a
house
of
this
kind
in
my
life
i
was
fascinated
beyond
expression
anna
constraint
soon
wore
off
and
she
treated
me
with
charming
hospitality
so
did
elsie
there
was
absolutely
no
difference
in
their
manner
toward
me
elsie
gave
me
the
attention
which
a
girl
usually
accords
to
a
close
friend
of
her
father
and
this
was
also
the
sort
of
attention
i
received
from
her
older
sister
it
was
as
if
the
catskill
episode
had
never
taken
place
and
she
were
now
seeing
me
for
the
first
time
i
met
moissey
and
his
wife
at
my
next
visit
he
was
a
man
of
or
more
tall
wiry
nervous
with
large
protruding
dark
eyes
he
was
a
dentist
by
profession
and
a
russian
social
democrat
by
religion
as
his
father
introduced
him
to
me
karl
marx
is
his
god
and
pleenanoff
the
russian
socialist
leader
is
his
moses
the
old
man
added
moissey
wife
looked
strikingly
semitic
she
seemed
to
have
just
stepped
out
of
the
old
testament
she
had
been
only
about
a
year
in
the
country
and
the
only
language
she
could
speak
was
russian
which
she
enunciated
without
a
trace
of
a
jewish
accent
or
intonation
she
scarcely
understood
yiddish
all
this
was
uncannily
at
variance
with
her
biblical
face
it
seemed
incredable
that
her
speech
and
outward
appearance
should
belong
to
the
same
person
to
add
to
the
discrepancy
she
was
smoking
cigarette
after
cigarette
a
performance
certainly
not
in
keeping
with
one
notion
of
a
jewish
woman
of
the
old
type
the
oldest
two
sons
moissey
and
sasha
spoke
english
with
a
russian
accent
from
which
the
english
of
all
the
other
children
was
absolutely
free
tevkin
russian
sounded
more
russian
than
her
husband
emil
elsie
and
gracie
did
not
speak
russian
at
all
barring
tevkin
each
adult
in
the
family
worshiped
at
the
shrine
of
some
ism
anna
professed
israel
zangwill
modified
zionism
or
territorialism
this
however
was
merely
a
platonic
interest
with
her
it
took
up
little
or
none
of
her
time
her
real
passion
was
minority
a
struggling
little
magazine
of
modernistic
literature
and
thought
it
was
published
by
a
group
of
radicals
of
which
she
was
a
member
elsie
on
the
other
hand
who
was
a
socialist
was
an
ardent
member
of
the
socialist
party
and
of
the
socialist
press
club
politically
the
two
sisters
were
supposed
to
be
irreconcilable
opponents
yet
anna
often
worked
in
the
interests
of
elsie
party
indeed
the
more
i
knew
them
the
clearer
it
became
to
me
that
the
older
sister
was
under
the
influence
of
the
younger
the
two
girls
and
their
brothers
had
many
visitors
socialist
and
anarchist
writers
poets
critics
artists
these
were
of
both
sexes
and
some
of
them
were
gentiles
two
of
the
most
frequent
callers
were
miss
siegel
and
the
homely
man
who
had
danced
with
anna
at
the
rigi
kulm
pavilion
he
was
an
instructor
in
an
art
school
from
his
talks
with
emil
and
anna
i
learned
of
a
whole
world
whose
existence
i
had
never
even
suspected
the
world
of
east
side
art
students
of
the
gifted
boys
among
them
some
of
whom
had
gone
to
study
in
paris
of
their
struggles
prospects
jealousies
i
was
introduced
to
several
of
these
people
but
i
never
came
into
sympathetic
touch
with
them
i
was
ever
conscious
never
my
real
self
in
their
midst
perhaps
it
was
because
they
did
not
like
me
perhaps
it
was
because
i
failed
to
appreciate
a
certain
something
that
was
the
key
note
to
their
mental
attitude
however
that
may
have
been
i
always
felt
wretched
in
their
company
and
my
attempts
at
saying
something
out
of
the
common
usually
missed
fire
was
anna
interested
in
any
of
the
young
men
who
came
to
the
house
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
she
was
not
but
i
was
not
sure
among
elsie
closest
friends
or
comrades
was
an
american
millionaire
a
member
of
one
of
the
families
in
new
york
and
his
wife
who
was
a
jewess
of
whom
i
had
read
in
the
papers
i
never
saw
them
at
the
tevkins
but
i
knew
that
they
occasionally
called
on
the
and
that
she
saw
a
good
deal
of
them
at
their
house
and
at
various
meetings
a
fact
the
discovery
of
which
produced
a
disheartening
impression
on
me
it
was
as
though
the
sole
advantage
i
enjoyed
over
anna
the
possession
of
money
suddenly
had
been
wiped
out
i
sometimes
wondered
whether
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
elsie
did
not
feel
elated
by
her
close
relations
with
that
couple
that
she
herself
was
a
stranger
to
all
money
interests
there
could
be
no
doubt
however
and
this
was
true
of
anna
and
the
other
children
elsie
and
moissey
were
the
strongest
individualities
in
the
family
theirs
were
truly
religious
natures
and
socialism
was
their
religion
in
the
purest
sense
of
the
term
elsie
scarcely
had
any
other
great
interest
in
life
her
socialism
amused
me
but
her
devotion
to
it
inspired
me
with
reverence
as
for
moissey
good
literature
as
the
term
is
understood
in
russia
was
nearly
as
much
of
a
passion
with
him
as
marxian
socialism
his
fervent
talks
of
what
he
considered
good
fiction
and
his
ferocious
assaults
upon
what
he
termed
candy
stories
were
very
impressive
though
i
did
not
always
understand
what
he
was
talking
about
sometimes
he
would
pick
a
quarrel
with
anna
over
minority
and
her
literary
hobbies
generally
once
he
brought
her
to
tears
by
his
attacks
i
could
not
see
why
people
should
quarrel
over
mere
stories
i
thought
moissey
crazy
but
i
must
confess
that
his
views
on
literature
were
not
without
influence
upon
my
tastes
i
did
not
do
much
reading
in
these
days
so
i
may
not
have
become
aware
of
it
at
once
but
at
a
later
period
when
i
did
do
much
reading
moissey
opinions
came
back
to
me
and
i
seemed
to
find
myself
in
accord
with
them
to
return
to
my
visits
at
the
tevkins
i
told
myself
again
and
again
that
their
world
was
not
mine
that
there
was
no
hope
for
me
and
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
discontinue
my
calls
but
i
had
not
the
strength
to
do
so
i
never
went
away
from
this
house
otherwise
than
dejected
and
forlorn
tevkin
was
charming
in
the
fervent
yet
tactful
hospitality
with
which
he
endeavored
to
assuage
the
bitterness
of
my
visits
he
seemed
to
say
i
see
everything
my
dear
friend
and
my
heart
goes
out
to
you
but
how
can
i
help
you
his
wife
tried
to
be
diplomatic
american
young
people
imagine
they
own
the
earth
she
once
said
to
me
with
a
knowing
glint
in
her
beautiful
eyes
some
day
they
find
out
their
mistake
the
hot
months
set
in
the
family
nominally
moved
to
rockaway
beach
for
the
season
and
my
visits
were
suspended
nominally
because
elsie
and
the
boys
and
old
tevkin
himself
slept
in
the
harlem
house
more
often
than
in
their
summer
home
elsie
was
wrapped
up
in
the
socialist
campaign
which
kept
her
busy
every
night
from
the
middle
of
july
to
election
day
she
practically
had
no
vacation
anna
made
arrangements
to
spend
her
brief
vacation
with
some
of
her
literary
friends
who
had
a
camp
in
maine
but
while
she
was
in
the
city
she
came
home
to
her
mother
and
gracie
almost
every
evening
as
for
her
father
whom
i
saw
several
times
during
that
summer
he
often
sat
up
far
into
the
night
in
or
some
other
restaurant
talking
parcels
he
had
become
so
absorbed
in
his
speculations
that
he
was
rarely
seen
at
yampolsky
café
these
days
one
evening
when
he
was
dining
with
me
at
the
private
hotel
in
which
i
lived
and
we
were
discussing
his
ventures
he
said
do
you
know
my
friend
i
have
made
more
than
twelve
thousand
dollars
he
tried
to
say
it
in
a
way
but
his
face
melted
into
an
expression
of
joy
before
he
finished
the
sentence
i
tell
it
to
you
because
i
know
that
you
are
a
real
friend
and
that
you
will
be
sincerely
glad
to
hear
it
he
went
on
i
certainly
am
i
awfully
glad
i
rejoined
fervently
i
expect
to
make
more
no
more
chipping
in
by
the
children
anna
shall
give
up
her
typewriting
and
elsie
her
teaching
yes
things
are
coming
my
way
at
last
still
if
i
were
you
i
should
go
slow
the
market
is
an
uncertain
thing
after
all
of
course
it
is
he
answered
mechanically
since
i
bought
that
brooklyn
parcel
and
refused
to
go
into
further
operations
he
had
never
approached
me
with
business
schemes
again
there
was
not
the
slightest
alloy
of
in
his
friendship
and
he
was
careful
not
to
have
it
appear
that
there
was
he
never
initiated
me
into
the
details
of
his
speculations
lest
i
should
offer
him
a
loan
he
was
quite
squeamish
about
it
one
day
i
offered
him
a
check
for
the
pen
the
hebrew
weekly
with
which
he
was
connected
and
upon
which
i
knew
him
to
spend
more
than
he
could
afford
i
do
want
it
he
said
reddening
and
shaking
his
head
why
i
asked
also
reddening
i
was
sorely
hurt
and
he
noticed
it
i
know
that
you
do
it
he
hastened
to
explain
but
i
do
want
to
feel
that
you
do
it
for
my
sake
but
i
do
do
it
for
your
sake
i
just
want
to
help
the
paper
i
he
interrupted
me
with
assurances
of
his
regard
for
me
and
for
my
motives
and
accepted
the
check
was
he
dreaming
of
anna
ultimately
agreeing
to
marry
me
and
my
money
he
certainly
considered
me
a
most
desirable
match
but
i
felt
sure
that
he
was
fond
of
me
on
my
personal
account
and
that
he
would
have
liked
to
have
me
for
his
even
if
my
income
had
not
exceeded
three
or
four
thousand
dollars
a
year
he
did
not
share
the
radical
views
of
his
children
he
was
much
nearer
to
my
point
of
view
than
they
chapter
v
it
was
december
there
was
an
air
of
prosperity
in
tevkin
house
but
the
girls
would
not
give
up
their
jobs
i
was
a
frequent
caller
again
i
was
burning
to
take
anna
elsie
and
their
parents
to
the
theater
but
was
afraid
the
two
girls
would
spurn
the
invitation
one
day
i
was
agreeably
surprised
by
elsie
asking
me
to
buy
some
tickets
for
a
socialist
ball
they
were
fifty
cents
apiece
how
many
do
you
want
me
to
take
i
asked
as
many
as
you
can
afford
she
answered
roguishly
will
you
sell
me
dollars
worth
oh
that
would
be
lovely
she
said
in
high
glee
when
i
handed
her
the
money
i
was
on
the
brink
of
asking
if
it
might
not
be
rejected
as
tainted
but
suppressed
the
pleasantry
for
me
to
attend
a
socialist
ball
would
have
meant
to
face
a
crowd
of
union
men
it
was
out
of
the
question
but
the
dollars
somehow
brought
me
nearer
to
elsie
and
that
meant
to
anna
also
i
began
to
feel
more
at
home
in
their
company
elsie
was
as
dear
as
a
sister
to
me
i
went
so
far
as
to
venture
to
invite
them
and
their
parents
to
the
opera
and
my
invitation
was
accepted
i
was
still
merely
a
friend
of
father
something
like
an
uncle
but
i
saw
a
ray
of
hope
now
suppose
a
commonplace
business
man
like
myself
offered
you
a
check
for
minority
i
once
said
to
anna
a
check
for
minority
she
echoed
with
joyful
surprise
well
it
would
be
accepted
with
thanks
of
course
but
you
would
first
have
to
withdraw
the
libel
commonplace
business
man
another
condition
is
that
you
must
promise
to
read
the
magazine
as
i
was
making
out
the
check
i
told
her
that
i
had
read
some
issues
of
it
and
that
i
solemnly
swore
to
read
it
regularly
now
that
i
had
found
it
an
unqualified
bore
i
omitted
to
announce
shortly
after
that
opera
night
tevkin
provided
a
box
at
one
of
the
jewish
theaters
for
a
play
by
jacob
gordin
i
was
quite
chummy
with
the
girls
they
would
jokingly
call
me
capitalist
and
despite
their
father
protests
bleed
me
for
all
sorts
of
contributions
one
of
these
came
near
embroiling
me
with
moissey
it
was
for
a
revolutionary
leader
a
jew
who
had
recently
escaped
from
a
siberian
prison
in
a
barrel
of
cabbage
and
whose
arrival
in
new
york
by
way
of
japan
and
san
francisco
had
been
the
great
sensation
of
the
year
among
the
socialists
of
the
east
side
the
was
the
founder
of
a
party
of
terrorists
and
had
organized
a
plot
which
had
resulted
in
the
killing
of
an
uncle
of
the
czar
and
of
a
prime
minister
now
moissey
in
his
rabid
uncompromising
way
sympathized
with
another
party
of
russian
revolutionists
with
one
that
was
bitterly
opposed
to
the
theories
and
methods
of
the
terrorists
so
when
he
learned
that
anna
was
collecting
funds
for
the
man
who
had
been
smuggled
out
of
jail
in
a
barrel
and
that
i
had
given
her
a
check
for
him
he
flared
up
and
called
her
busybody
you
had
better
mind
your
own
affairs
moissey
she
retorted
coloring
she
essayed
to
defend
her
position
contending
that
the
methods
of
the
russian
government
rendered
terrorism
not
only
justifiable
but
inevitable
the
question
is
not
whether
it
is
justifiable
but
whether
there
is
any
sense
to
it
moissey
replied
sneeringly
revolutions
are
not
made
by
plotting
or
they
must
take
the
form
of
an
uprising
by
the
masses
as
if
the
russian
terrorists
did
not
have
the
masses
back
of
them
the
peasantry
and
the
educated
classes
are
with
them
how
do
you
know
they
are
moissey
asked
with
a
but
patronizing
smile
he
spoke
of
the
russian
working
class
as
the
great
element
that
was
destined
to
work
out
the
political
and
economic
salvation
of
the
country
and
at
this
he
tactlessly
dwelt
on
the
russian
on
what
he
termed
their
revolutionary
strikes
and
upon
the
aid
russian
capitalists
gave
the
government
in
its
crusade
upon
the
struggle
for
liberty
i
felt
quite
awkward
i
wondered
whether
he
was
not
saying
these
things
designedly
to
punish
me
for
the
check
i
had
given
anna
for
the
terrorists
he
had
always
seemed
to
hold
aloof
from
me
as
if
he
were
opposed
to
the
visits
of
the
that
i
was
at
his
house
at
this
minute
i
felt
as
though
his
eyes
said
the
idea
of
this
fleecer
of
labor
contributing
to
the
struggle
for
liberty
i
was
burning
to
tell
him
that
he
lacked
manners
and
to
assail
but
i
restrained
myself
of
course
sometimes
the
girls
and
i
would
discuss
the
social
question
or
literature
subjects
upon
which
they
assured
me
that
i
held
naďve
views
but
all
my
efforts
to
get
anna
into
a
more
intimate
conversation
failed
for
all
our
familiarity
it
seemed
as
if
we
held
our
conversations
through
a
thick
nevertheless
in
a
very
vague
way
and
for
no
particular
reason
that
i
was
aware
of
i
thought
that
i
sensed
encouragement
tevkin
never
again
approached
me
with
his
ventures
but
the
very
air
of
his
house
these
days
was
full
of
such
ventures
i
met
other
men
at
his
home
their
talk
was
tempting
my
enormous
income
notwithstanding
huge
fortunes
seemed
to
be
growing
like
mushrooms
all
over
the
five
ghettos
of
new
york
and
brooklyn
i
saw
men
who
three
years
ago
had
not
been
worth
a
cent
and
who
were
now
buying
and
selling
blocks
of
property
how
much
they
were
actually
worth
was
a
question
which
in
the
excitement
of
the
boom
did
not
seem
to
matter
it
is
never
a
rare
incident
among
our
people
for
a
man
with
a
nebulous
fortune
of
a
few
hundred
dollars
to
plunge
into
a
commercial
undertaking
involving
many
thousands
but
during
that
period
this
was
an
affair
at
first
i
treated
it
like
something
that
was
going
on
in
another
country
but
i
had
a
good
deal
of
uninvested
money
and
my
resistance
was
slackening
at
last
i
succumbed
one
of
the
men
i
met
at
tevkin
was
volodsky
the
street
peddler
the
man
of
the
beautiful
teeth
whose
had
adjoined
mine
in
those
gloomy
days
when
i
tried
to
sell
goods
in
the
streets
and
who
had
told
me
of
the
which
his
sister
had
lent
him
for
his
journey
to
america
i
had
not
seen
him
since
then
an
interval
of
over
twenty
years
and
we
recognized
each
other
with
some
difficulty
the
boom
had
found
him
eking
out
a
wretched
livelihood
by
selling
goods
on
the
instalment
plan
most
of
his
business
had
been
in
the
italian
quarter
and
he
had
learned
to
speak
italian
far
more
fluently
than
he
had
english
a
short
time
before
i
stumbled
upon
him
at
the
tevkins
he
had
built
an
enormous
block
of
high
brick
in
harlem
he
had
gone
into
the
undertaking
with
only
five
thousand
dollars
of
his
own
and
before
the
houses
were
half
completed
he
had
sold
them
all
pocketing
an
enormous
profit
when
we
were
peddlers
together
he
had
been
considered
a
failure
and
a
fool
he
now
struck
me
as
a
clever
fellow
full
of
dash
nor
did
volodsky
represent
the
only
metamorphosis
of
this
kind
that
i
came
across
it
was
as
though
there
were
something
in
the
atmosphere
which
turned
paupers
into
capitalists
and
inane
milksops
into
men
of
brains
and
pluck
volodsky
succeeded
in
luring
me
into
a
network
of
speculations
tevkin
had
an
interest
in
some
of
these
operations
and
as
they
were
mostly
concerned
with
property
in
harlem
or
in
the
bronx
his
house
became
my
headquarters
there
were
two
classes
of
callers
at
his
home
now
the
socialists
and
the
literary
men
or
artists
who
visited
tevkin
children
and
the
crowd
who
came
to
see
tevkin
himself
it
came
to
be
tacitly
understood
that
the
library
was
to
be
left
to
the
former
while
the
in
the
basement
was
used
as
tevkin
office
being
a
friend
of
the
family
i
had
the
freedom
of
both
you
making
a
big
mistake
levinsky
nodelman
once
said
to
me
with
a
gesture
of
deep
concern
what
is
biting
you
you
making
money
fast
enough
mark
my
word
if
you
try
to
swallow
too
fast
you
choke
any
doctor
will
tell
you
that
i
urged
him
to
join
me
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it
instead
he
exhorted
me
to
sell
out
my
holdings
and
give
all
my
attention
to
my
cloak
business
take
pity
on
your
pennies
levinsky
he
would
say
else
you
wake
up
some
day
like
the
fellow
who
has
dreamed
he
has
found
a
treasure
he
holding
on
to
the
treasure
tight
and
when
he
opens
his
eyes
he
finds
it
nothing
but
a
handful
of
wind
i
tell
you
what
levinsky
he
began
on
one
occasion
you
ought
to
see
some
of
those
magician
fellows
what
for
i
asked
did
you
ever
see
them
at
their
game
they
put
an
egg
into
a
hat
say
two
three
and
pull
out
a
chicken
and
then
they
say
two
three
again
and
there
neither
a
chicken
nor
an
egg
that
the
way
all
this
racket
will
end
mark
my
word
levinsky
bender
nagged
and
pleaded
with
me
without
if
i
had
had
the
remotest
doubt
of
his
devotion
to
me
it
would
have
been
dispelled
now
i
was
at
my
great
mahogany
desk
every
morning
as
usual
but
i
seldom
stayed
more
than
two
hours
and
even
during
those
two
hours
my
mind
was
divided
between
cloaks
and
real
estate
or
between
cloaks
and
anna
bender
was
practically
in
full
charge
of
the
business
instead
however
of
welcoming
the
power
it
gave
him
he
made
unrelenting
efforts
to
restore
things
to
their
former
state
he
was
constantly
haranguing
me
on
the
risks
i
was
incurring
beseeching
me
to
drop
my
new
ventures
and
threatening
to
leave
me
unless
i
did
so
once
as
he
was
thus
expostulating
with
me
he
broke
down
i
appeal
to
you
as
your
friend
as
your
teacher
he
said
and
burst
into
tears
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
i
should
have
neglected
my
cloak
business
beyond
repair
he
handled
me
as
a
gambler
wife
does
her
husband
he
would
seek
me
out
in
front
of
some
unfinished
building
at
tevkin
or
at
some
boom
café
and
make
me
sign
some
checks
consult
me
on
something
or
other
or
wheedle
me
into
accompanying
him
to
my
factory
for
an
hour
or
two
but
the
next
day
he
would
have
to
go
hunting
for
me
again
i
had
invested
considerable
money
in
my
new
affairs
and
releasing
it
at
short
notice
would
not
have
been
an
easy
matter
but
the
great
point
was
that
i
was
literally
intoxicated
by
my
new
interests
and
the
fact
that
they
were
intimately
associated
with
the
atmosphere
of
anna
home
had
much
perhaps
everything
to
do
with
it
i
loved
her
to
insanity
she
was
the
supreme
desire
of
my
being
i
knew
that
she
was
weaker
in
character
and
mind
than
elsie
for
example
but
that
seemed
to
be
a
point
in
her
favor
rather
than
against
her
she
is
a
good
girl
i
would
muse
mild
kindly
girlish
as
for
her
notions
they
really
do
matter
much
i
could
easily
knock
them
out
of
her
i
should
be
happy
with
her
oh
how
happy
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
thought
her
weak
the
sight
of
her
would
fill
me
with
awe
one
first
love
is
said
to
be
the
most
passionate
love
of
which
one
is
capable
i
do
not
think
it
is
i
think
my
feeling
for
anna
was
stronger
deeper
more
tender
and
more
overpowering
than
either
of
my
previous
two
infatuations
but
then
of
course
there
is
no
way
of
measuring
and
comparing
things
of
this
kind
anna
was
the
first
virgin
i
had
ever
loved
was
that
responsible
for
the
particular
depth
of
my
feeling
oh
i
must
have
her
or
i
fall
to
pieces
i
would
say
to
myself
yearning
and
groaning
and
whining
like
a
lunatic
my
gambling
mania
was
really
the
aberration
of
a
brain
how
could
bender
or
nodelman
understand
it
i
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
other
lunatics
of
men
who
had
simply
been
knocked
out
of
balance
by
the
suddenness
of
their
gains
my
money
had
come
slowly
and
through
work
and
worry
theirs
had
dropped
from
the
sky
so
they
could
scarcely
believe
their
senses
that
it
was
not
all
a
dream
they
were
hysterical
with
gleeful
amazement
they
were
in
a
delirium
of
ecstasy
over
themselves
and
at
the
same
time
they
looked
as
though
they
were
tempted
to
feel
their
own
faces
and
hands
to
make
sure
that
they
were
real
one
evening
i
saw
a
man
whose
family
was
still
living
on
fifteen
dollars
a
week
lose
more
than
six
hundred
dollars
in
poker
and
then
take
a
group
of
congenial
spirits
out
for
a
spree
that
cost
him
a
few
hundred
dollars
more
one
man
in
this
party
who
was
said
to
be
worth
of
a
million
had
only
recently
worked
as
a
common
he
is
fixed
in
my
memory
by
his
struggles
to
live
up
to
his
new
position
more
especially
by
the
efforts
he
would
make
to
break
himself
of
certain
habits
of
speech
he
always
seemed
to
be
on
his
guard
lest
some
coarse
word
or
phrase
should
escape
him
and
when
a
foul
expression
eluded
his
vigilance
he
would
give
a
start
as
if
he
had
broken
something
there
was
often
a
wistful
look
in
his
eye
as
if
he
wondered
whether
his
wealth
and
new
mode
of
living
were
not
merely
a
cruel
practical
joke
or
was
he
yearning
for
the
simpler
and
more
natural
life
which
he
had
led
until
two
years
ago
we
had
many
an
expensive
meal
together
and
often
as
he
ate
he
would
say
oh
it
all
nonsense
levinsky
all
this
fussy
stuff
does
not
come
up
to
one
spoon
of
my
cabbage
soup
once
he
said
do
you
really
like
champagne
i
do
you
may
say
i
am
a
common
ignorant
fellow
but
to
me
it
does
come
up
to
the
bread
cider
mother
used
to
make
honest
and
he
gave
a
chuckle
i
knew
a
man
who
bought
a
fur
coat
and
a
suit
before
he
had
learned
to
use
a
handkerchief
he
always
had
one
in
his
pocket
but
he
would
handle
it
gingerly
as
if
he
had
not
the
heart
to
soil
it
and
then
he
would
carefully
fold
it
again
the
effect
money
had
on
this
man
was
of
quite
another
nature
than
it
was
in
the
case
of
the
bricklayer
it
had
made
him
boisterously
arrogant
blusteringly
disdainful
of
his
intellectual
superiors
and
brazenly
it
was
as
though
he
was
shouting
i
do
have
to
fear
or
respect
anybody
now
i
have
got
a
lot
of
money
i
can
do
as
i
damn
please
more
than
one
pure
man
became
dissolute
in
the
riot
of
easily
gotten
wealth
a
speculator
once
hinted
to
me
in
a
fit
of
drunken
confidence
that
his
wife
hitherto
a
good
woman
and
a
simple
home
body
had
gone
astray
through
the
new
vistas
of
life
that
had
suddenly
been
flung
open
to
her
one
fellow
who
was
naturally
truthful
was
rapidly
becoming
a
liar
through
the
practice
of
exaggerating
his
profits
and
expenditures
there
was
an
abundance
of
comedy
in
the
things
i
saw
about
me
but
there
was
no
dearth
of
pathos
either
one
day
as
i
entered
a
certain
restaurant
on
broadway
i
saw
at
one
of
the
tables
a
man
who
looked
strikingly
familiar
to
me
but
whom
i
was
at
first
unable
to
locate
presently
i
recognized
him
three
or
four
years
before
he
had
peddled
apples
among
the
employees
of
my
he
had
then
been
literally
in
tatters
that
was
why
i
was
now
slow
to
connect
his
former
image
with
his
present
surroundings
i
had
heard
of
his
windfall
he
had
had
a
job
as
watchman
at
houses
in
process
of
construction
while
there
he
had
noticed
things
overheard
conversations
put
two
and
two
together
and
finally
made
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
a
few
months
as
a
broker
we
were
furtively
eying
each
other
finally
our
eyes
met
he
greeted
me
with
a
respectful
nod
and
then
his
face
broke
into
a
smile
he
moved
over
to
my
table
and
told
me
his
story
in
detail
he
spoke
in
brief
pithy
sentences
revealing
a
remarkable
understanding
of
the
world
in
conclusion
he
said
with
a
sigh
but
what
is
the
good
of
it
all
the
upper
one
has
blessed
me
with
one
hand
but
he
has
punished
me
with
the
other
it
appeared
that
his
wife
had
died
in
austria
just
when
she
was
about
to
come
to
join
him
and
he
was
preparing
to
surprise
her
with
what
to
her
would
have
been
a
palatial
apartment
for
six
years
i
tried
to
bring
her
over
but
could
not
manage
it
he
said
simply
i
barely
made
enough
to
feed
one
mouth
when
good
luck
came
at
last
she
died
she
was
a
good
woman
but
i
never
gave
her
a
day
happiness
for
eighteen
years
she
shared
my
poverty
and
now
that
there
is
something
better
to
share
she
is
gone
chapter
vi
one
of
the
many
jewish
immigrants
who
were
drawn
into
the
whirl
of
speculation
was
max
margolis
dora
husband
i
had
heard
his
name
in
connection
with
some
deals
and
one
afternoon
in
february
we
found
ourselves
side
by
side
in
a
crowd
of
other
boomers
the
scene
was
the
corner
of
fifth
avenue
and
one
hundred
and
sixteenth
street
two
blocks
from
tevkin
residence
a
spot
that
usually
swarmed
with
speculators
in
those
days
it
was
a
gesticulating
jabbering
whispering
excited
throng
resembling
the
crowd
of
on
broad
street
hence
the
nickname
the
curb
by
which
that
corner
was
getting
to
be
known
i
was
talking
to
tevkin
when
somebody
slapped
me
on
the
back
hello
levinsky
hello
margolis
his
face
had
the
florid
hue
of
worn
nervous
middle
age
i
heard
you
were
buying
is
it
true
well
how
goes
it
great
man
how
have
you
been
ca
kick
of
course
compared
to
a
big
fellow
like
david
levinsky
i
am
a
fly
i
excused
myself
to
tevkin
and
took
margolis
to
the
quieter
side
of
the
avenue
glad
to
see
you
upon
my
word
he
said
well
let
bygones
by
bygones
it
about
time
we
forgot
it
all
there
is
nothing
to
forget
honest
honest
is
that
idiotic
notion
still
sticking
in
your
brain
why
no
not
at
all
may
i
not
live
till
if
it
does
you
are
not
angry
at
me
are
you
come
now
say
that
you
are
not
i
smiled
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
well
shake
hands
then
we
did
and
he
offered
to
sell
me
a
parcel
as
i
did
not
care
for
it
he
went
on
to
talk
of
the
market
in
general
there
was
a
restaurant
on
that
side
of
the
block
the
curb
café
we
used
to
call
it
so
we
went
in
ordered
something
and
he
continued
to
talk
he
was
plainly
striving
to
sound
me
in
the
hope
of
hanging
on
to
some
of
my
deals
of
a
sudden
he
said
say
you
must
think
i
still
jealous
may
i
not
live
till
if
i
am
and
to
prove
that
he
was
not
he
added
come
levinsky
come
up
to
the
house
and
let
be
friends
again
as
we
used
to
be
i
have
always
wished
you
well
he
gave
me
his
address
will
you
come
some
day
you
are
still
angry
at
dora
are
you
why
no
but
then
she
may
be
still
angry
at
me
i
said
indifferently
nonsense
perhaps
it
is
beneath
your
dignity
to
call
on
small
people
like
us
come
forget
that
you
are
a
great
capitalist
and
let
us
all
spend
an
evening
together
as
we
used
to
was
he
ready
to
suppress
his
jealousy
for
the
prospect
of
getting
under
my
financial
wing
the
answer
to
this
question
came
to
me
through
a
most
unexpected
channel
the
next
morning
when
i
came
to
my
fifth
avenue
office
it
was
some
eighty
blocks
about
four
miles
downtown
from
the
curb
section
of
fifth
avenue
i
found
dora
waiting
for
me
i
recognized
her
the
moment
i
entered
the
on
my
office
floor
her
hair
was
almost
white
and
she
had
grown
rather
fleshy
but
her
face
had
not
changed
she
wore
a
large
becoming
hat
and
was
quite
neatly
dressed
generally
the
blood
surged
to
my
face
her
presence
was
a
bewildering
surprise
to
me
there
were
three
other
people
in
the
room
and
i
had
to
be
on
my
guard
how
are
you
i
said
rushing
over
to
her
she
stood
up
and
we
shook
hands
i
took
her
into
my
private
office
through
my
private
corridor
dora
well
well
i
murmured
in
a
delirium
of
embarrassment
i
have
come
to
tell
you
not
to
mind
margolis
and
not
to
call
at
the
house
she
said
gravely
looking
me
full
in
the
face
it
would
be
awful
if
you
did
he
is
out
of
his
mind
he
is
wait
a
minute
dora
i
interrupted
her
there
be
plenty
of
time
to
talk
of
that
first
tell
me
something
about
yourself
how
have
you
been
how
are
the
children
she
was
like
an
old
song
that
had
once
held
me
under
its
sway
but
which
now
appealed
to
me
as
a
memory
only
i
was
conscious
of
my
consuming
passion
for
anna
dora
interested
and
annoyed
me
at
once
i
treated
her
as
a
dear
old
friend
she
however
persisted
in
wearing
a
mask
of
politeness
as
if
she
had
come
strictly
on
business
and
there
had
never
been
any
other
relations
between
us
everybody
is
all
right
thank
you
she
answered
is
lucy
married
oh
she
has
a
beautiful
little
girl
of
two
years
but
i
do
want
to
tell
you
about
margolis
the
man
is
simply
crazy
and
i
want
to
warn
you
not
to
take
him
seriously
above
all
do
let
him
take
you
up
to
the
house
not
for
anything
in
the
world
that
what
brings
me
here
this
morning
why
what
the
trouble
oh
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
she
answered
and
it
important
either
the
main
thing
is
that
you
should
not
let
him
get
into
business
relations
with
you
or
into
any
other
kind
of
relations
for
that
matter
her
english
was
a
striking
improvement
upon
what
it
had
been
sixteen
years
before
as
we
continued
to
talk
it
became
evident
to
me
that
she
was
a
woman
i
made
some
efforts
to
break
her
reserve
but
they
failed
nor
indeed
was
i
to
have
them
succeed
she
did
speak
of
her
husband
jealousy
however
though
she
dropped
her
glance
and
slurred
over
the
word
as
she
did
so
and
from
what
she
said
as
well
as
by
reading
between
the
lines
of
her
statement
i
gathered
a
fairly
clear
picture
of
the
situation
echoes
of
max
old
jealousy
would
still
make
themselves
felt
in
his
domestic
life
a
clash
an
irritation
would
sometimes
bring
my
name
to
his
lips
he
still
sometimes
tortured
her
with
questions
concerning
our
relations
i
never
answer
these
questions
of
his
she
said
her
eyes
on
my
office
rug
not
a
word
i
just
let
him
talk
but
sometimes
i
feel
like
putting
an
end
to
my
life
she
concluded
with
a
smile
i
listened
with
expressions
of
surprise
and
sympathy
and
with
a
feeling
of
compunction
a
thought
was
sluggishly
trailing
through
my
mind
does
she
still
care
for
me
margolis
had
built
up
some
sort
of
auction
business
but
his
mania
had
ruined
it
and
eaten
up
all
he
had
except
three
thousand
dollars
which
dora
had
contrived
to
save
from
the
wreck
with
this
she
had
bought
a
store
on
washington
heights
by
means
of
which
she
now
supported
the
family
he
spent
his
days
and
evenings
hanging
around
haunts
as
a
penniless
drunkard
does
around
he
was
always
importuning
dora
for
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
for
a
sure
thing
this
was
often
the
cause
of
an
altercation
quarrels
had
in
fact
never
been
such
a
frequent
occurrence
in
the
house
as
they
had
been
since
he
lost
his
money
in
real
estate
and
one
of
his
favorite
thrusts
in
the
course
of
these
brawls
was
to
allude
to
me
if
levinsky
asked
you
for
money
you
would
not
refuse
him
would
you
he
would
taunt
her
now
that
he
had
met
me
at
the
curb
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
that
his
jealousy
had
worn
off
long
since
and
that
he
had
the
best
of
feelings
for
me
his
heart
was
set
upon
regaining
my
friendship
he
had
spoken
to
her
of
our
meeting
as
a
predestined
thing
that
was
to
result
in
my
letting
him
in
on
some
of
my
deals
dora
however
felt
sure
that
a
renewal
of
our
acquaintance
would
only
rekindle
the
worst
forms
of
his
jealousy
and
make
life
impossible
to
her
she
dreaded
to
imagine
it
we
spoke
of
lucy
again
it
was
so
stirring
to
think
of
her
as
a
mother
dora
told
me
that
lucy
husband
was
in
the
jewelry
business
and
quite
she
rose
to
go
i
escorted
her
continuing
to
question
her
about
lucy
dannie
her
husband
it
would
have
been
natural
for
me
to
take
her
out
by
way
of
my
private
little
corridor
but
i
preferred
to
pilot
her
through
my
luxurious
we
found
two
customers
there
to
whom
some
of
my
office
men
and
a
designer
were
showing
our
line
i
greeted
the
customers
and
turning
to
dora
again
i
asked
her
to
finish
an
interrupted
remark
we
paused
by
one
of
the
windows
what
she
was
saying
about
lucy
was
beginning
to
puzzle
me
she
did
not
seem
to
be
pleased
with
her
daughter
marriage
she
has
three
servants
and
a
machine
she
said
with
a
peculiar
smile
she
wanted
it
and
she
got
what
she
wanted
why
i
said
perplexed
everything
is
all
right
she
answered
with
another
smile
we
spoke
in
an
undertone
so
that
nobody
could
overhear
us
the
fact
however
that
we
were
no
longer
alone
had
the
effect
of
relieving
our
constraint
dora
unbent
somewhat
a
certain
note
of
intimacy
that
had
been
lacking
in
our
talk
while
we
were
by
ourselves
stole
into
it
now
that
we
were
in
the
presence
of
other
people
in
the
course
of
our
she
had
often
spoken
to
me
of
her
determination
not
to
let
lucy
repeat
her
mistake
not
to
let
her
marry
otherwise
than
a
man
she
loved
we
were
both
thinking
of
it
at
this
minute
and
it
seemed
to
be
tacitly
understood
between
us
that
we
were
at
last
i
ventured
to
ask
what
the
trouble
dora
tell
me
all
about
it
it
interests
me
very
much
i
do
know
whether
there
anything
to
tell
she
answered
coloring
slightly
she
says
she
cares
for
her
husband
and
they
really
get
along
very
well
he
certainly
worships
her
why
should
he
she
is
so
beautiful
a
regular
flower
and
he
is
old
enough
to
be
her
father
you
do
say
i
ejaculated
with
genuine
distress
she
is
satisfied
are
you
as
if
it
mattered
whether
i
was
or
not
i
had
other
ideas
about
her
happiness
but
i
am
only
a
mother
and
was
not
even
born
in
this
country
so
what
does
my
opinion
amount
to
i
begged
her
not
to
break
my
heart
but
she
would
have
her
automobile
perhaps
she
does
love
him
she
shook
her
head
ruefully
she
was
quite
frank
about
it
she
called
it
being
practical
she
thought
my
ideas
were
american
that
i
was
a
dreamer
she
talked
that
way
ever
since
she
was
eighteen
in
fact
care
if
i
marry
a
man
with
white
hair
provided
he
can
make
a
nice
living
for
me
she
used
to
say
i
thought
it
would
drive
me
mad
and
the
girls
she
went
with
had
the
same
ideas
when
they
got
together
it
would
be
girl
married
a
fellow
who
worth
a
hundred
thousand
and
girl
goes
with
a
fellow
who
worth
half
a
million
if
that
what
they
learn
at
college
what
the
use
going
to
college
it
prosperity
ideas
i
suggested
it
a
temporary
craze
i
do
care
what
it
is
a
girl
should
be
a
girl
she
ought
to
think
of
love
of
real
happiness
her
glance
seemed
to
be
the
least
bit
unsteady
but
i
ai
do
you
know
exactly
what
my
mother
peace
upon
her
this
in
hebrew
used
to
say
she
too
did
not
think
it
was
necessary
to
be
in
love
with
the
man
you
marry
but
then
she
did
not
go
to
college
not
even
to
school
of
what
good
is
education
then
it
was
evident
that
she
spoke
from
an
overflowing
heart
and
that
she
could
speak
for
hours
on
the
subject
but
she
cut
herself
short
and
took
another
tack
you
must
not
think
her
husband
is
a
kike
though
she
said
he
is
no
fool
and
he
writes
a
pretty
good
english
letter
and
he
is
a
very
nice
man
she
started
to
go
tell
me
some
more
about
dannie
i
said
on
our
way
to
the
elevator
he
going
to
college
always
first
or
second
in
his
class
and
one
of
the
best
men
on
the
football
team
too
she
smiled
the
first
radiant
smile
i
had
seen
on
her
that
morning
he
all
right
she
continued
and
in
yiddish
he
is
my
only
consolation
and
again
in
english
if
it
was
for
him
life
would
be
worth
living
she
said
as
we
paused
in
front
of
the
elevator
door
do
forget
what
i
told
you
she
was
ill
at
ease
again
the
elevator
came
down
from
the
upper
floors
we
shook
hands
and
she
entered
it
it
sank
out
of
sight
i
stood
still
for
a
second
and
then
returned
to
my
private
office
with
a
sense
of
relief
and
sadness
my
heart
was
full
of
love
for
anna
chapter
vii
in
a
vague
timid
way
i
had
been
planning
to
propose
to
anna
all
along
my
meeting
with
dora
gave
these
plans
shape
her
unexpected
visit
revived
in
my
mind
the
whole
history
of
my
acquaintance
with
her
i
said
to
myself
it
was
through
tenacity
and
persistence
that
i
won
her
it
was
persistence
too
that
gave
me
success
in
business
anna
is
a
meek
girl
she
has
far
less
backbone
than
dora
i
can
win
her
and
i
will
it
seemed
so
convincing
it
was
like
a
discovery
it
aroused
the
fighting
blood
in
my
veins
i
was
throbbing
with
love
and
determination
i
was
priming
myself
for
a
formal
proposal
i
expected
to
take
her
by
storm
i
was
only
waiting
for
an
opportunity
in
case
she
said
no
i
was
prepared
for
a
long
and
vigorous
campaign
i
wo
give
her
up
she
shall
be
mine
whether
she
wants
it
or
not
i
said
to
myself
again
and
again
these
soliloquies
would
go
on
in
my
mind
at
all
hours
and
in
all
kinds
of
circumstances
while
i
was
pushing
my
way
through
a
crowded
while
i
was
listening
to
some
of
scoldings
while
i
was
parleying
with
some
man
over
a
piece
of
property
they
often
made
me
so
that
i
would
pace
the
floor
of
my
hotel
room
for
instance
with
one
foot
socked
and
the
other
bare
and
then
distressedly
search
for
the
other
sock
which
was
in
my
hand
one
morning
as
i
sat
at
my
mahogany
desk
in
my
office
with
the
telephone
receiver
to
my
ear
waiting
to
be
connected
with
a
banker
i
said
to
myself
women
like
a
man
with
a
strong
will
my
very
persistence
will
fascinate
her
and
this
too
seemed
like
a
discovery
to
me
the
banker
answered
my
call
it
was
an
important
matter
yet
all
the
while
i
spoke
or
listened
to
him
i
was
conscious
of
having
hit
upon
an
invincible
argument
in
support
of
my
hope
that
anna
would
be
mine
at
last
i
thought
i
saw
my
opportunity
it
was
an
evening
in
april
according
to
the
jewish
calendar
it
was
the
first
passover
night
when
israel
liberation
from
the
bondage
of
egypt
is
commemorated
by
a
feast
and
family
reunion
which
form
the
greatest
event
in
the
domestic
life
of
our
people
two
years
before
when
i
was
engaged
to
fanny
i
deeply
regretted
not
being
able
to
spend
the
great
evening
at
her
father
table
this
time
i
was
an
invited
guest
at
the
tevkins
they
were
not
a
religious
family
by
any
means
tevkin
had
been
a
since
his
early
manhood
and
his
wife
the
daughter
of
the
jewish
ingersoll
had
been
born
and
bred
in
an
atmosphere
of
aggressive
atheism
and
so
religious
faith
never
had
been
known
in
their
house
of
late
years
however
that
is
since
tevkin
had
espoused
the
cause
of
zionism
or
nationalism
he
had
insisted
on
the
passover
feast
every
year
he
contended
that
to
him
it
was
not
a
religious
ceremony
but
merely
a
national
custom
but
about
this
his
children
were
beginning
to
have
their
doubts
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
older
their
father
grew
the
less
sure
he
was
of
his
free
thought
they
suspected
that
he
was
getting
timid
about
it
fearful
of
the
hereafter
as
a
rule
they
saw
only
the
humorous
side
of
the
change
that
was
apparently
coming
over
him
but
sometimes
they
would
awaken
to
the
pathos
of
it
as
we
all
sat
in
the
library
waiting
to
be
called
to
the
great
feast
he
delivered
himself
of
a
witticism
at
the
expense
of
the
prospective
ceremony
you
need
take
his
atheism
seriously
levinsky
said
anna
the
sound
of
my
name
on
her
lips
sending
a
thrill
of
delight
through
me
down
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
father
is
getting
to
be
really
religious
i
afraid
and
as
though
taking
pity
on
him
she
crossed
over
to
where
he
sat
and
nestled
up
to
him
in
a
manner
that
put
a
choking
sensation
into
my
throat
and
filled
me
with
an
impulse
to
embrace
them
both
at
last
the
signal
was
given
and
we
filed
down
into
the
a
long
table
flanked
by
two
rows
of
chairs
with
a
sofa
instead
of
the
usual
at
its
head
was
set
with
bottles
of
wine
bottles
of
mead
and
little
piles
of
matzos
thin
flat
cakes
of
unleavened
bread
the
sofa
was
cushioned
with
two
huge
russian
pillows
inclosed
in
fresh
white
cases
for
the
master
of
the
house
to
lean
on
in
commemoration
of
the
freedom
and
ease
which
came
to
the
children
of
israel
upon
their
deliverance
from
egypt
placed
on
three
covered
matzos
within
easy
reach
of
the
master
were
a
shank
bone
an
egg
some
horseradish
salt
water
and
a
mush
made
of
nuts
and
wine
these
were
symbols
the
shank
bone
being
a
memorial
of
the
pascal
lamb
and
the
egg
of
the
other
sacrifices
brought
during
the
festival
in
ancient
times
while
the
horseradish
and
the
salt
water
represented
the
bitter
work
that
the
sons
of
israel
had
to
do
for
pharaoh
and
the
mush
the
lime
and
mortar
from
which
they
made
brick
for
him
a
small
book
lay
in
front
of
each
seat
that
was
the
story
of
the
deliverance
in
the
ancient
hebrew
text
accompanied
by
an
english
translation
moissey
the
uncompromising
atheist
and
internationalist
was
demonstratively
absent
much
to
the
distress
of
his
mother
and
resentment
of
his
father
his
wife
was
at
the
table
so
were
elsie
and
emil
they
were
as
uncompromising
in
their
atheism
as
moissey
but
they
had
consented
to
attend
the
quaint
supper
to
please
their
parents
as
to
anna
sasha
and
george
each
of
them
had
his
or
her
socialism
diluted
with
some
species
of
nationalism
so
they
were
here
as
a
matter
of
principle
their
theory
being
that
the
passover
feast
was
one
of
the
things
that
emphasized
the
unity
of
the
jews
of
all
countries
but
even
they
and
even
tevkin
himself
treated
it
all
partly
as
a
joke
in
the
case
of
the
poet
however
it
was
quite
obvious
that
his
levity
was
pretended
for
all
his
jesting
and
frivolity
he
looked
nervous
i
could
almost
see
the
memories
of
his
childhood
days
which
the
scene
evoked
in
his
mind
i
could
feel
the
solemnity
that
swelled
his
heart
it
appeared
that
this
time
he
had
decided
to
add
to
the
ceremony
certain
features
which
he
had
foregone
on
the
previous
few
passover
festivals
he
had
observed
he
was
now
bent
upon
having
a
passover
feast
service
precisely
like
the
one
he
had
seen
his
father
conduct
not
omitting
even
the
white
shroud
which
his
father
had
worn
on
the
occasion
as
a
consequence
several
of
these
details
were
a
novel
sight
to
his
children
a
white
shroud
lay
ready
for
him
on
his
sofa
and
as
he
slipped
it
on
with
smiles
and
blushes
there
was
an
outburst
of
mirth
oh
daddy
anna
shouted
father
looks
like
a
catholic
priest
said
emil
do
say
that
emil
i
rebuked
him
fun
was
made
of
the
big
white
pillows
upon
which
tevkin
leaned
and
of
the
piece
of
unleavened
bread
which
he
hid
under
them
for
gracie
to
steal
as
he
raised
the
first
of
the
four
cups
of
wine
he
said
solemnly
with
an
effort
of
shaking
off
all
pretense
of
flippancy
well
let
us
raise
our
glasses
let
us
drink
the
first
cup
we
all
did
so
and
he
added
this
is
the
fourth
of
july
of
our
unhappy
people
after
the
glasses
were
drained
and
refilled
he
said
scenes
like
this
bind
us
to
the
jews
of
the
whole
world
and
not
only
to
those
living
but
to
the
past
generations
as
well
this
is
no
time
for
speaking
of
the
christian
religion
but
as
i
look
at
this
wine
an
idea
strikes
me
which
i
can
not
help
submitting
the
christians
drink
wine
imagining
that
it
is
the
blood
of
jesus
well
the
wine
we
are
drinking
reminds
me
of
the
martyr
blood
of
our
massacred
brethren
of
all
ages
anna
gave
me
a
merry
wink
i
felt
myself
one
of
the
family
i
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
she
seemed
to
be
particularly
attentive
to
me
this
evening
i
shall
speak
to
her
i
decided
i
wait
another
day
and
the
fact
that
she
was
a
nationalist
and
not
an
unqualified
socialist
like
elsie
for
instance
seemed
to
me
a
new
source
of
encouragement
i
was
in
a
quiver
of
blissful
excitement
the
four
questions
are
usually
asked
by
the
youngest
son
but
emil
the
internationalist
could
not
be
expected
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
ceremony
so
sasha
the
zionist
took
his
place
sasha
however
did
not
read
hebrew
and
old
tevkin
had
to
be
content
with
having
the
four
questions
read
in
english
the
general
answer
to
them
being
given
by
tevkin
and
myself
in
hebrew
it
reminded
me
of
an
operatic
performance
in
which
the
part
of
faust
for
instance
is
sung
in
french
while
that
of
margarita
is
performed
in
some
other
language
we
went
on
with
the
story
of
the
deliverance
tevkin
made
frequent
pauses
to
explain
and
comment
upon
the
text
often
with
a
burst
of
oratory
tevkin
and
some
of
the
children
were
obviously
bored
gracie
pleaded
hunger
finally
the
end
of
the
first
part
of
the
story
was
reached
and
supper
was
served
it
was
a
typical
passover
supper
with
matzo
balls
and
it
was
an
excellent
repast
everybody
was
talkative
and
gay
i
addressed
some
remarks
to
anna
and
she
received
them
all
cordially
by
way
of
attesting
her
recognition
of
passover
as
a
national
holiday
she
was
in
festive
array
wearing
her
newest
dress
a
garment
of
blue
taffeta
embroidered
in
old
rose
with
a
crępe
collar
of
gray
it
mellowed
the
glow
of
her
healthful
pink
complexion
she
was
the
most
beautiful
creature
at
the
table
excluding
neither
her
picturesque
younger
brother
nor
her
majestic
old
mother
she
shone
she
flooded
my
soul
with
ecstasy
tevkin
religion
was
judaism
zionism
mine
was
anna
the
second
half
of
the
story
is
usually
read
with
less
pomp
and
circumstance
than
the
first
many
a
passage
in
it
being
often
skipped
altogether
so
tevkin
dismissed
us
all
remaining
alone
at
the
table
to
chant
the
three
final
ballads
which
he
had
characterized
to
his
children
as
charming
bits
of
when
tevkin
the
children
and
myself
were
mounting
the
stairs
leading
up
from
the
i
was
by
anna
side
my
nerves
as
taut
as
those
of
a
soldier
waiting
for
the
command
to
charge
i
charged
sooner
than
i
expected
sasha
asked
the
four
questions
i
found
myself
saying
there
is
one
question
which
i
should
like
to
ask
of
you
miss
tevkin
i
said
it
so
simply
and
at
a
moment
so
little
suited
to
a
proposal
of
marriage
that
the
trend
of
my
words
was
lost
upon
her
something
about
jewish
nationalism
she
asked
about
that
and
about
something
else
we
were
passing
through
the
hallway
now
when
we
entered
the
library
i
took
her
into
a
corner
and
before
we
were
seated
i
said
well
my
question
has
really
nothing
to
do
with
nationalism
quite
another
thing
i
want
to
ask
of
you
do
refuse
me
marry
me
make
me
happy
she
listened
like
one
stunned
i
am
terribly
in
love
with
you
i
added
oh
she
then
exclaimed
her
delicate
pink
skin
became
a
fiery
red
she
looked
down
and
shook
her
head
with
confused
stiffness
i
see
you
taken
aback
take
a
seat
get
your
bearings
i
said
lightly
pulling
up
a
chair
that
stood
near
by
and
say
why
that
impossible
she
said
with
an
awkward
smile
without
seating
herself
i
need
not
tell
you
that
i
have
long
since
changed
my
mind
about
you
i
am
no
more
repellent
am
i
i
jested
no
not
at
all
she
returned
with
another
smile
but
what
you
say
is
quite
another
thing
i
am
very
sorry
indeed
she
made
to
move
away
from
me
but
i
checked
her
that
does
not
discourage
me
i
said
i
just
go
on
loving
you
and
waiting
for
a
favorable
answer
you
are
still
unjust
to
me
you
do
know
me
well
enough
anyhow
i
ca
give
you
up
i
wo
give
you
up
that
it
i
thought
i
am
speaking
like
a
man
of
firm
purpose
i
am
resolved
to
win
you
oh
that
entirely
out
of
the
question
she
said
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
and
finality
and
bursting
into
tears
of
indignation
she
added
father
assured
me
you
would
never
hint
at
such
a
thing
never
if
you
mean
to
persist
then
the
sentence
was
left
eloquently
unfinished
she
turned
away
walked
over
to
her
mother
and
took
a
seat
by
her
side
like
a
little
girl
mutely
seeking
her
mamma
protection
the
room
seemed
to
be
in
a
whirl
i
felt
the
cold
perspiration
break
out
on
my
forehead
i
was
conscious
of
tevkin
and
glances
i
was
sick
at
heart
anna
bitter
resentment
was
a
black
surprise
to
me
i
had
a
crushing
sense
of
final
defeat
book
xiv
episodes
of
a
lonely
life
chapter
i
it
was
a
severe
blow
it
caused
me
indescribable
suffering
it
would
not
have
been
unnatural
to
attribute
my
fiasco
to
my
age
had
i
been
ten
years
younger
anna
attitude
toward
me
might
have
been
different
but
this
point
of
view
i
loathed
to
accept
instead
i
put
the
blame
on
anna
environment
i
was
in
the
country
there
i
would
muse
the
atmosphere
around
her
was
against
me
i
hated
the
socialists
with
a
novel
venom
finally
i
pulled
myself
together
then
it
was
that
i
discovered
the
real
condition
of
my
affairs
i
had
gone
into
those
speculations
far
deeper
than
i
could
afford
there
were
indications
that
made
me
seriously
uneasy
things
were
even
worse
than
bender
imagined
ruin
stared
me
in
the
face
i
was
one
day
i
had
the
head
of
a
large
woolen
concern
lunch
with
me
in
a
private
of
a
hotel
he
was
dignifiedly
and
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
college
professor
or
successful
physician
rather
than
of
a
business
man
he
liked
me
i
had
long
been
one
of
his
most
important
customers
and
i
had
always
sought
to
build
up
a
good
record
with
him
for
example
other
would
exact
allowances
for
merchandise
that
proved
to
have
some
imperfection
i
never
do
so
it
is
the
rule
of
my
house
never
to
put
in
a
claim
for
such
things
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
goods
can
be
cut
so
as
to
avoid
any
loss
of
material
and
if
it
can
not
i
will
sustain
the
small
loss
rather
than
incur
the
mill
disfavor
in
the
long
run
it
pays
and
so
this
cloth
merchant
was
well
disposed
toward
me
he
had
done
me
some
favors
before
he
addressed
me
as
dave
there
was
a
note
of
condescension
as
well
as
of
admiration
in
this
dave
of
his
it
implied
that
i
was
a
shrewd
fellow
and
an
excellent
customer
singularly
successful
and
reliable
but
that
i
was
his
inferior
all
the
same
a
jew
a
social
pariah
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
considered
myself
his
superior
finding
an
amusing
discrepancy
between
his
professorial
face
and
the
crudity
of
his
intellectual
interests
but
he
was
a
gentile
and
an
american
and
a
much
wealthier
man
than
i
so
i
looked
up
to
him
to
make
my
appeal
as
effective
as
possible
i
initiated
him
into
the
human
side
of
my
troubles
i
told
him
of
my
unfortunate
courtship
as
well
as
of
the
ventures
into
which
it
had
led
me
he
was
interested
and
moved
and
as
he
had
confidence
in
me
he
granted
my
request
at
once
it
all
right
dave
he
said
slapping
my
back
a
queer
look
in
his
eye
you
can
always
count
on
me
only
throw
that
girl
out
of
your
mind
i
grasped
his
hand
silently
i
wanted
to
say
something
but
the
words
stuck
in
my
throat
he
helped
me
out
of
my
difficulties
and
i
devoted
myself
to
the
cloak
business
with
fresh
energy
the
agonies
of
my
love
for
anna
were
more
persistent
than
those
i
had
suffered
after
i
moved
out
of
dora
house
but
somehow
instead
of
interfering
with
my
business
activities
these
agonies
stimulated
them
i
was
like
the
victim
of
a
toothache
who
seeks
relief
in
hard
work
i
toiled
day
and
night
entering
into
the
minutest
detail
of
the
business
and
performing
duties
that
were
ordinarily
left
to
some
inferior
employee
business
was
good
things
went
humming
bender
who
now
had
an
interest
in
my
factory
was
happy
some
time
later
the
same
woolen
man
who
had
come
to
my
assistance
did
me
another
good
turn
one
that
brought
me
a
rich
harvest
of
profits
a
certain
weave
was
in
great
vogue
that
season
the
demand
far
exceeding
the
output
and
it
so
happened
that
the
mill
of
the
man
with
the
professorial
face
was
one
of
the
very
few
that
produced
that
fabric
so
he
let
me
have
a
much
larger
supply
of
it
than
any
other
in
the
country
was
able
to
obtain
my
business
then
took
a
great
leap
while
my
overhead
expenses
remained
the
same
my
net
profits
exceeded
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
year
one
afternoon
in
the
summer
of
the
same
year
as
i
walked
along
broadway
in
the
vicinity
of
canal
street
my
attention
was
attracted
by
a
shabby
old
peddler
with
a
wide
sneering
mouth
who
seemed
disquietingly
familiar
and
in
whom
i
gradually
recognized
one
of
my
antomir
teachers
one
of
those
who
used
to
punish
me
for
the
sins
of
their
other
pupils
the
past
suddenly
sprang
into
life
with
detailed
colorful
vividness
the
black
pit
of
poverty
in
which
i
had
been
raised
my
misery
at
school
where
i
had
been
treated
as
an
outcast
and
a
scapegoat
because
my
mother
could
not
afford
even
the
few
pennies
that
were
charged
for
my
tuition
the
joy
of
my
childish
existence
in
spite
of
that
gloom
and
martyrdom
all
this
rose
from
the
dead
before
me
the
poor
old
peddler
i
now
saw
trying
to
cross
broadway
was
shmerl
the
pincher
the
man
with
whom
my
mother
had
a
pinching
and
duel
after
she
found
the
marks
of
his
cruelty
on
my
young
body
he
had
been
one
of
the
most
heartless
of
my
tormentors
yet
it
was
so
thrillingly
sweet
to
see
him
in
new
york
in
my
schooldays
i
would
dream
of
becoming
a
rich
and
influential
man
and
wreaking
vengeance
upon
my
brutal
teachers
more
especially
upon
shmerl
the
pincher
and
the
cossack
the
man
whose
little
daughter
had
been
the
heroine
of
my
first
romance
i
now
rushed
after
shmerl
greatly
excited
one
of
the
feelings
in
my
heart
being
a
keen
desire
to
help
him
a
tangle
of
wagons
and
caused
me
some
delay
i
stood
gazing
at
him
restively
as
he
picked
his
weary
way
i
had
known
him
as
a
young
man
although
to
my
childish
eye
he
had
looked
old
a
strong
fellow
probably
of
with
and
beard
with
bright
black
eyes
and
alert
movements
at
the
time
i
saw
him
on
broadway
he
must
have
been
about
sixty
but
he
looked
much
older
as
i
was
thus
waiting
impatiently
for
the
cars
to
start
so
that
i
could
cross
the
street
and
greet
him
a
cold
practical
voice
whispered
to
me
why
court
trouble
leave
him
alone
my
exaltation
was
gone
the
spell
was
broken
the
block
was
presently
relieved
but
i
did
not
stir
instead
of
crossing
the
street
and
accosting
the
old
man
i
stood
still
following
him
with
my
eyes
until
he
vanished
from
view
then
i
resumed
my
walk
up
broadway
as
i
trudged
along
a
feeling
of
compunction
took
hold
of
me
by
way
of
defending
myself
before
my
conscience
i
tried
to
think
of
the
unmerited
beatings
he
used
to
give
me
but
it
was
of
no
avail
the
idea
of
avenging
myself
on
this
decrepit
tattered
old
peddler
for
what
he
had
done
more
than
thirty
years
before
made
me
feel
small
poor
devil
i
must
help
him
i
said
to
myself
i
was
conscious
of
a
desire
to
go
back
and
to
try
to
overtake
him
but
i
did
not
the
desire
was
a
meandering
sluggish
sort
of
feeling
the
spell
was
broken
irretrievably
chapter
ii
the
following
winter
chance
brought
me
together
with
matilda
on
this
occasion
our
meeting
was
of
a
pleasanter
nature
than
the
one
which
had
taken
place
at
cooper
institute
it
was
in
a
jewish
theater
she
and
another
woman
accompanied
by
four
men
one
of
whom
was
matilda
husband
were
occupying
a
box
adjoining
one
in
which
were
the
chaikins
and
myself
and
from
which
it
was
separated
by
a
low
partition
the
performance
was
given
for
the
benefit
of
a
society
in
which
chaikin
was
an
active
member
and
it
was
she
who
had
made
me
pay
for
the
box
and
solemnly
promise
to
attend
the
performance
not
that
i
maintained
a
snobbish
attitude
toward
the
jewish
stage
i
went
to
see
yiddish
plays
quite
often
in
fact
but
these
were
all
of
the
better
class
our
stage
has
made
considerable
headway
whereas
the
one
that
had
been
selected
by
chaikin
society
was
of
the
variety
a
of
vaudeville
and
high
tragedy
i
should
have
bought
ten
boxes
of
chaikin
if
she
had
only
let
me
stay
away
from
the
performance
but
her
heart
was
set
upon
showing
me
off
to
the
other
members
of
the
organization
and
i
had
to
come
it
was
on
a
monday
evening
as
i
entered
the
box
my
eyes
met
matilda
and
contrary
to
my
will
i
bowed
to
her
to
my
surprise
she
acknowledged
my
salutation
heartily
the
curtain
rose
men
in
velvet
tunics
and
plumed
hats
were
saying
something
but
i
was
more
conscious
of
proximity
and
of
her
cordial
recognition
of
my
nod
than
of
what
was
going
on
on
the
stage
presently
a
young
man
and
a
girl
entered
our
box
and
occupied
two
of
our
vacant
chairs
chaikin
thought
they
had
been
invited
by
me
and
when
she
discovered
that
they
had
not
there
was
a
suppressed
row
she
calling
upon
them
to
leave
the
box
and
they
nonchalantly
refusing
to
stir
from
their
seats
pleading
that
they
meant
to
stay
only
as
long
as
there
was
no
one
else
to
occupy
them
our
box
was
beginning
to
attract
attention
there
were
angry
outcries
of
shut
up
matilda
looked
at
me
sympathetically
and
we
exchanged
smiles
finally
an
usher
came
into
our
box
and
the
two
intruders
were
ejected
when
the
curtain
had
dropped
on
the
first
act
matilda
invited
me
into
her
box
when
i
entered
it
she
introduced
me
to
her
husband
and
her
other
companions
as
a
of
hers
seen
at
close
range
her
husband
looked
much
younger
than
she
but
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
discover
that
he
was
wrapped
up
in
her
his
beard
was
smaller
and
more
neatly
trimmed
than
it
had
looked
at
the
cooper
institute
meeting
but
it
still
ill
became
him
he
had
an
unsophisticated
smile
which
i
thought
suggestive
of
a
man
playing
on
a
flute
and
which
emphasized
the
discrepancy
between
his
weak
face
and
his
reputation
for
pluck
an
intermission
in
a
jewish
theater
is
almost
as
long
as
an
act
during
the
first
few
minutes
of
our
chat
matilda
never
alluded
to
antomir
nor
to
what
had
happened
between
us
at
cooper
institute
she
made
merry
over
the
advertisements
on
the
curtain
and
over
the
story
of
the
play
explaining
that
the
box
had
been
forced
on
one
of
her
companions
and
that
they
had
all
come
to
see
what
historic
opera
was
like
she
commented
upon
the
musicians
who
were
playing
a
jewish
melody
and
on
some
of
the
scenes
that
were
being
enacted
in
the
big
auditorium
the
crowd
was
buzzing
and
smiling
with
a
general
air
of
sociability
some
eating
apple
or
candy
the
faces
of
some
of
the
men
were
much
in
need
of
a
shave
most
of
the
women
were
in
altogether
the
audience
reminded
one
of
a
crowd
at
a
picnic
a
boy
tottering
under
the
weight
of
a
basket
laden
with
candy
and
fruit
was
singing
his
wares
a
pretty
young
woman
stood
in
the
center
aisle
near
the
second
row
of
seats
her
head
thrown
back
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
first
balcony
her
plump
body
swaying
and
swaggering
to
the
music
one
man
seated
in
a
box
across
the
theater
from
us
was
trying
to
speak
to
somebody
in
the
box
above
ours
we
could
not
hear
what
he
said
but
his
mimicry
was
eloquent
enough
holding
out
a
box
of
candy
he
was
facetiously
offering
to
shoot
some
of
its
contents
into
the
mouth
of
the
person
he
was
addressing
one
woman
in
an
orchestra
seat
near
our
box
was
discussing
the
play
with
a
woman
in
front
of
her
she
could
be
heard
all
over
the
theater
she
was
in
ecstasies
over
the
prima
donna
i
tell
you
she
can
kill
a
person
with
her
singing
she
said
admiringly
she
tugs
me
by
the
heart
and
makes
it
melt
i
never
felt
so
heartbroken
in
my
life
may
she
live
long
this
was
the
first
opportunity
i
had
had
to
take
a
good
look
at
matilda
since
she
had
come
to
new
york
for
our
first
meeting
had
been
so
brief
and
so
embarrassing
to
me
that
i
had
come
away
from
it
without
a
clear
impression
of
her
appearance
at
first
i
found
it
difficult
to
look
her
in
the
face
the
passionate
kisses
i
had
given
her
years
before
seemed
to
be
staring
me
out
of
countenance
she
however
was
perfectly
unconstrained
and
smiled
and
laughed
with
contagious
exuberance
as
we
chatted
i
now
and
again
grew
indulging
in
a
mental
comparison
between
the
woman
who
was
talking
to
me
and
the
one
who
had
made
me
embrace
her
and
so
cruelly
trifled
with
my
passion
shortly
before
she
raised
the
money
for
my
journey
to
america
the
change
that
the
years
had
wrought
in
her
appearance
was
striking
and
yet
it
was
the
same
matilda
her
brown
eyes
were
still
sparkingly
full
of
life
and
her
mouth
retained
the
sensuous
expression
of
her
youth
this
and
her
abrupt
gestures
gave
her
provocative
charm
nevertheless
she
left
me
calm
it
was
an
indescribable
pleasure
to
be
with
her
but
my
love
for
her
was
as
dead
as
were
the
days
when
i
lodged
in
a
synagogue
she
never
alluded
to
those
days
to
listen
to
her
one
would
have
thought
that
we
had
been
seeing
a
great
deal
of
each
other
all
along
and
that
small
talk
was
the
most
natural
kind
of
conversation
for
us
to
carry
on
all
at
once
and
quite
irrelevantly
she
said
i
am
awfully
glad
to
see
you
again
i
did
not
treat
you
properly
that
time
at
the
meeting
i
mean
afterward
i
was
very
sorry
were
you
i
asked
flippantly
i
wanted
to
write
you
to
ask
you
to
come
to
see
me
but
well
you
know
how
it
is
tell
me
something
about
yourself
at
this
minute
the
years
seem
like
weeks
but
this
is
no
time
to
talk
about
it
one
wants
hours
not
a
minute
or
two
i
know
of
course
that
you
are
a
rich
man
are
you
a
happy
man
but
no
do
answer
now
the
curtain
will
soon
rise
go
back
to
your
box
and
come
in
again
after
the
next
act
will
you
she
ordered
me
about
as
she
had
done
during
my
stay
at
her
mother
house
which
offended
and
pleased
me
at
once
during
the
whole
of
the
second
act
i
looked
at
the
stage
without
seeing
or
hearing
anything
the
time
when
i
fell
in
love
with
matilda
sprang
into
life
again
it
really
seemed
as
though
the
years
were
weeks
my
mother
death
her
funeral
abner
court
the
uniformed
old
furrier
with
the
his
wife
with
her
crutches
naphtali
with
his
curly
hair
and
eyes
reb
sender
his
wife
the
bully
of
the
old
synagogue
matilda
mother
and
her
old
servant
all
the
human
figures
and
things
that
filled
the
eventful
last
two
years
of
my
life
at
home
loomed
up
with
striking
vividness
before
me
matilda
affable
greeting
and
her
intimate
brief
talk
were
a
surprise
to
me
did
i
appeal
to
her
as
the
fellow
who
had
once
kissed
her
had
she
always
remembered
me
with
a
gleam
of
romantic
interest
did
i
stir
her
merely
as
she
stirred
me
as
a
living
fragment
of
her
past
or
was
she
trying
to
cultivate
me
in
the
professional
interests
of
her
husband
who
was
practising
medicine
in
harlem
when
the
curtain
had
fallen
again
matilda
made
her
husband
change
seats
with
me
i
was
to
stay
by
her
side
through
the
rest
of
the
performance
the
partition
between
the
two
boxes
being
only
the
two
parties
were
practically
joined
into
one
and
everybody
was
satisfied
everybody
except
chaikin
i
suppose
our
company
is
good
enough
for
levinsky
she
said
aloud
when
the
performance
was
over
we
all
went
to
lorber
the
most
pretentious
restaurant
on
the
east
side
matilda
and
i
were
mostly
left
to
ourselves
we
talked
of
our
native
town
and
of
her
pious
mother
who
had
died
a
few
years
before
but
we
carefully
avoided
the
few
weeks
which
i
had
spent
in
her
mother
house
when
matilda
had
encouraged
my
embraces
in
answer
to
my
questions
she
told
me
something
of
her
own
and
her
revolutionary
exploits
she
spoke
boastfully
and
yet
reluctantly
of
these
things
as
if
it
were
a
sacrilege
to
discuss
them
with
a
man
who
was
after
all
a
my
impression
was
that
they
lived
very
modestly
and
that
they
were
more
interested
in
their
socialist
affairs
than
in
their
income
my
theory
that
she
wanted
her
husband
to
profit
by
her
acquaintance
with
me
seemed
to
be
exploded
she
reminded
me
of
elsie
and
her
devotion
to
socialism
we
mostly
spoke
in
yiddish
and
our
antomir
enunciation
was
like
a
bond
of
kinship
between
us
and
yet
i
felt
that
she
spoke
to
me
in
the
patronizing
didactical
way
which
one
adopts
with
a
foreigner
as
though
the
world
to
which
she
belonged
was
one
whose
interests
were
beyond
my
comprehension
she
inquired
about
my
early
struggles
and
subsequent
successes
i
told
her
of
the
studies
i
had
pursued
before
i
went
into
business
of
the
english
classics
i
had
read
and
of
my
acquaintance
with
spencer
do
you
remember
what
you
told
me
about
becoming
an
educated
man
i
said
eagerly
your
words
were
always
ringing
in
my
ears
it
was
owing
to
them
that
i
studied
for
admission
to
college
i
was
crazy
to
be
a
college
man
but
fate
ordained
otherwise
to
this
day
i
regret
it
in
dwelling
on
my
successes
i
felt
that
i
was
too
effusive
and
emphatic
but
i
went
on
bragging
in
spite
of
myself
i
tried
to
correct
the
impression
i
was
making
on
her
by
boasting
of
the
sums
i
had
given
to
charity
but
this
made
me
feel
smaller
than
ever
however
my
talk
did
not
seem
to
arouse
any
criticism
in
her
mind
she
listened
to
me
as
she
might
to
the
tale
of
a
child
referring
to
my
unmarried
state
she
said
with
unfeigned
sympathy
this
is
really
no
life
you
ought
to
get
married
and
she
added
gaily
if
you
ever
marry
you
must
neglect
to
invite
me
to
the
wedding
i
certainly
wo
you
may
be
sure
of
that
i
said
you
must
come
to
see
me
i
call
you
up
on
the
telephone
some
day
and
we
arrange
it
i
shall
be
very
glad
indeed
i
departed
in
a
queer
state
of
mind
her
present
identity
failed
to
touch
a
romantic
chord
in
my
heart
she
was
simply
a
memory
like
dora
but
as
a
memory
she
had
rekindled
some
of
the
old
yearning
in
me
i
was
still
in
love
with
anna
but
at
this
moment
i
was
in
love
both
with
her
and
with
the
matilda
of
years
before
but
this
intense
feeling
for
matilda
as
a
monument
of
my
past
self
did
not
last
two
days
the
invitation
she
had
promised
to
telephone
never
came
i
came
across
a
man
whom
i
used
to
see
at
the
tevkins
and
one
of
the
things
he
told
me
was
that
anna
had
recently
married
a
teacher
chapter
iii
the
real
estate
boom
collapsed
the
cause
of
the
catastrophe
lay
in
the
nature
or
rather
in
the
unnaturalness
of
the
epidemic
its
immediate
cause
however
was
a
series
of
rent
strikes
inspired
and
engineered
by
the
jewish
socialists
through
their
yiddish
daily
one
of
the
many
artificialities
of
the
situation
had
been
a
progressive
inflation
of
rent
values
houses
had
been
continually
changing
hands
being
bought
not
as
a
permanent
investment
but
for
speculation
whereupon
each
successive
purchaser
would
raise
rents
as
a
means
of
increasing
the
market
price
of
his
temporary
property
and
so
the
socialists
had
organized
a
crusade
that
filled
the
municipal
courts
with
dispossess
cases
and
turned
the
boom
into
a
panic
hundreds
of
people
who
had
become
rich
overnight
now
became
worse
than
penniless
overnight
the
ghetto
was
full
of
dethroned
kings
for
a
day
only
it
seemed
as
if
it
all
really
had
been
a
dream
one
of
the
men
whose
quickly
made
little
fortune
burst
like
a
bubble
was
poor
tevkin
i
wondered
how
his
children
took
the
socialist
rent
strikes
nor
did
i
escape
uninjured
when
the
crisis
broke
loose
i
still
had
a
considerable
sum
in
real
estate
all
my
efforts
to
extricate
it
having
proved
futile
my
holdings
were
rapidly
depreciating
in
hundreds
of
cases
similar
to
mine
equities
were
wiped
out
through
the
speculators
inability
to
pay
interest
on
mortgages
or
even
taxes
to
be
sure
things
did
not
come
to
such
a
pass
in
my
case
but
then
some
of
the
city
lots
or
improved
property
in
which
i
was
interested
had
been
hit
so
hard
as
to
be
no
longer
worth
the
mortgages
on
them
volodsky
lost
almost
everything
except
his
courage
and
speculative
spirit
oh
it
will
come
back
he
once
said
to
me
speaking
of
the
boom
when
i
urged
that
it
had
been
an
unnatural
growth
he
retorted
that
it
was
the
collapse
of
the
boom
which
was
unnatural
he
was
scheming
some
sort
of
syndicate
again
it
requires
no
money
to
make
a
lot
of
money
he
said
all
it
does
require
is
brains
and
some
good
luck
nevertheless
he
coveted
some
of
my
money
for
his
new
scheme
he
did
not
succeed
with
me
but
he
found
other
angels
he
was
now
quite
in
his
element
in
the
american
atmosphere
of
breathless
enterprise
and
breakneck
speed
when
the
violence
of
the
crisis
had
quieted
down
building
operations
were
resumed
on
a
more
natural
basis
men
like
volodsky
with
hosts
of
carpenters
bricklayers
plumbers
all
russian
or
galician
jews
continued
to
build
up
the
bronx
washington
heights
and
several
sections
of
brooklyn
vast
areas
of
meadowland
and
rock
were
turned
by
them
as
by
a
magic
wand
into
densely
populated
avenues
and
streets
of
brick
and
mortar
under
the
spell
of
their
activity
cities
larger
than
odessa
sprang
up
within
the
confines
of
greater
new
york
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
years
chaikin
came
out
of
her
speculations
more
than
safe
she
and
her
husband
who
is
still
in
my
employ
own
half
a
dozen
one
day
on
the
first
of
the
month
i
met
her
in
the
street
with
a
large
and
a
dignified
mien
she
was
out
collecting
rent
chapter
iv
it
was
the
spring
of
the
anniversary
of
my
coming
to
america
was
drawing
near
the
day
of
an
immigrant
arrival
in
his
new
home
is
like
a
birthday
to
him
indeed
it
is
more
apt
to
claim
his
attention
and
to
warm
his
heart
than
his
real
birthday
some
of
our
immigrants
do
not
even
know
their
birthday
but
they
all
know
the
day
when
they
came
to
america
it
is
landing
day
with
red
capital
letters
this
at
any
rate
is
the
case
with
me
the
day
upon
which
i
was
born
often
passes
without
my
being
aware
of
it
the
day
when
i
landed
in
hoboken
on
the
other
hand
never
arrives
without
my
being
fully
conscious
of
the
place
it
occupies
in
the
calendar
of
my
life
is
it
because
i
do
not
remember
myself
coming
into
the
world
while
i
do
remember
my
arrival
in
america
however
that
may
be
the
advent
of
that
day
invariably
puts
me
in
a
sentimental
mood
which
i
never
experience
on
the
day
of
my
birth
it
was
then
and
the
anniversary
of
my
coming
was
near
at
hand
thoughts
of
the
past
filled
me
with
mixed
joy
and
sadness
i
was
overcome
with
a
desire
to
celebrate
the
day
but
with
whom
usually
this
is
done
by
ship
brothers
as
call
who
arrive
here
on
the
same
boat
it
came
back
to
me
that
i
had
such
a
ship
brother
and
that
it
was
gitelson
poor
gitelson
he
was
still
working
at
his
trade
i
had
not
seen
him
for
years
but
i
had
heard
of
him
from
time
to
time
and
i
knew
that
he
was
employed
by
a
ladies
tailor
at
custom
work
somewhere
in
brooklyn
the
shop
he
had
once
started
for
himself
had
proved
a
failure
also
i
knew
how
to
reach
a
of
his
the
upshot
was
that
i
made
an
appointment
with
gitelson
for
him
to
be
at
my
office
on
the
great
day
at
i
did
so
without
specifying
the
object
of
the
meeting
but
i
expected
that
he
would
know
finally
the
day
arrived
it
was
a
few
minutes
to
i
was
alone
in
my
private
office
all
in
a
fidget
as
if
the
meeting
i
was
expecting
were
a
reminiscences
and
reflections
were
flitting
incoherently
through
my
mind
some
of
the
events
of
the
day
which
i
was
about
to
celebrate
loomed
up
like
a
ship
seen
in
the
distance
my
eye
swept
the
expensive
furniture
of
my
office
i
thought
of
the
way
my
career
had
begun
i
thought
of
the
friday
evening
when
i
met
gitelson
on
grand
street
he
an
american
dandy
and
i
in
tatters
the
fact
that
it
was
upon
his
advice
and
with
his
ten
dollars
that
i
had
become
a
stood
out
as
large
as
life
before
me
a
great
feeling
of
gratitude
welled
up
in
me
of
gratitude
and
of
pity
for
my
tattered
self
of
those
days
dear
kind
gitelson
poor
fellow
he
was
still
working
with
his
needle
i
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
do
something
for
him
i
had
never
paid
him
those
ten
dollars
so
i
was
going
to
do
so
with
substantial
interest
now
i
shall
spend
a
few
hundred
dollars
on
him
nay
a
few
thousand
i
said
to
myself
i
shall
buy
him
a
small
business
let
him
end
his
days
in
comfort
let
him
know
that
his
ship
brother
is
like
a
real
brother
to
him
it
was
twenty
minutes
after
and
i
was
still
waiting
for
the
telephone
to
announce
him
my
suspense
became
insupportable
is
he
going
to
disappoint
me
the
idiot
i
wondered
presently
the
telephone
trilled
i
seized
the
receiver
gitelson
wishes
to
see
levinsky
came
the
familiar
pipe
of
my
switchboard
girl
he
says
he
has
an
appointment
let
him
come
in
at
once
i
flashed
two
minutes
later
he
was
in
my
room
his
forelock
was
still
the
only
bunch
of
gray
hair
on
his
head
but
his
face
was
pitifully
wizened
he
was
quite
neatly
dressed
as
trained
tailors
will
be
even
when
they
are
poor
and
at
some
distance
i
might
have
failed
to
perceive
any
change
in
him
at
close
range
however
his
appearance
broke
my
heart
do
you
know
what
sort
of
a
day
this
is
i
asked
after
shaking
his
hand
warmly
i
should
think
i
did
he
answered
sheepishly
years
ago
at
this
time
he
was
at
a
loss
for
words
yes
it
years
gitelson
i
rejoined
i
was
going
to
indulge
in
reminiscences
to
compare
memories
with
him
but
changed
my
mind
i
would
rather
not
speak
of
our
landing
day
until
we
were
seated
at
a
and
after
we
had
drunk
its
toast
in
champagne
come
let
us
have
lunch
together
i
said
simply
i
took
him
to
the
where
a
table
had
been
reserved
for
us
in
a
snug
corner
gitelson
was
extremely
bashful
and
his
embarrassment
infected
me
he
was
apparently
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
with
the
various
glasses
knives
forks
it
was
evident
that
he
had
never
sat
at
such
a
table
before
the
french
waiter
who
was
silently
officious
seemed
to
be
inwardly
laughing
at
both
of
us
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
cow
before
waiters
to
this
day
their
white
reticence
and
pompous
bows
make
me
feel
as
if
they
saw
through
me
and
ridiculed
my
ways
they
make
me
feel
as
if
my
expensive
clothes
and
ways
ill
became
me
here
is
good
health
gitelson
i
said
in
plain
old
yiddish
as
we
touched
glasses
let
us
drink
to
the
day
when
we
arrived
in
castle
garden
there
was
something
forced
studied
in
the
way
i
uttered
these
words
i
was
disgusted
with
my
own
voice
gitelson
only
simpered
he
drained
his
glass
and
the
champagne
to
which
he
was
not
accustomed
made
him
tipsy
at
once
i
tried
to
talk
of
our
ship
of
the
cap
he
had
lost
of
his
timidity
when
we
had
found
ourselves
in
castle
garden
of
the
policeman
whom
i
asked
to
direct
us
but
gitelson
only
nodded
and
grinned
and
tittered
i
realized
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
that
i
should
have
taken
him
to
a
more
modest
restaurant
but
then
the
chasm
between
him
and
me
seemed
to
be
too
wide
for
us
to
celebrate
as
ship
brothers
in
any
place
by
the
way
gitelson
i
owe
you
something
i
said
producing
a
bill
it
was
with
your
ten
dollars
that
i
learned
to
be
a
and
entered
the
cloak
trade
do
you
remember
i
was
going
to
add
something
about
my
desire
to
help
him
in
some
substantial
way
but
he
interrupted
me
sure
i
do
he
said
with
inebriate
shamefacedness
as
he
received
the
money
and
shoved
it
into
the
inside
pocket
of
his
vest
it
has
brought
you
good
luck
has
it
and
how
about
the
interest
he
he
he
you
kept
it
over
years
the
interest
must
be
quite
a
little
he
he
he
of
course
i
pay
you
the
interest
and
more
too
you
shall
get
a
check
oh
i
was
only
joking
but
i
am
not
joking
you
going
to
get
a
check
all
right
he
revolted
me
i
made
out
a
check
for
two
hundred
dollars
tore
it
and
made
out
one
for
five
hundred
he
flushed
scanned
the
figure
giggled
hesitated
and
finally
folded
the
check
and
pushed
it
into
his
inner
vest
pocket
thanking
me
with
drunken
ardor
some
time
later
i
was
returning
to
my
office
my
heart
heavy
with
and
sadness
in
the
evening
i
went
home
to
the
loneliness
of
my
beautiful
hotel
lodgings
my
heart
was
still
heavy
with
distaste
and
sadness
chapter
v
gussie
the
to
whom
i
had
once
made
love
with
a
view
to
marrying
her
for
her
money
worked
in
the
vicinity
of
my
factory
and
i
met
her
from
time
to
time
on
the
avenue
we
kept
up
our
familiar
tone
of
former
days
we
would
pause
exchange
some
banter
and
go
our
several
ways
she
was
over
fifty
now
she
looked
haggard
and
dried
up
and
her
hair
was
copiously
shot
with
gray
one
afternoon
she
told
me
she
had
changed
her
shop
naming
her
new
employer
is
it
a
good
place
to
work
in
i
inquired
oh
it
as
good
or
as
bad
as
any
other
place
she
replied
with
a
gay
smile
mine
is
good
i
jested
that
what
they
all
say
come
to
work
for
me
and
see
for
yourself
will
i
get
good
wages
yes
how
much
any
price
you
name
look
at
him
she
said
as
though
addressing
a
third
person
look
at
the
new
millionaire
it
might
have
been
all
yours
but
you
did
not
think
i
was
good
enough
for
you
you
can
keep
it
all
to
yourself
and
welcome
well
will
you
come
to
work
you
ca
do
without
me
can
you
he
ca
get
the
poor
fellow
well
how
much
will
you
pay
me
we
agreed
upon
the
price
but
on
taking
leave
she
said
i
was
joking
what
do
you
mean
do
you
want
to
work
for
me
gussie
she
shook
her
head
why
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
begrudge
you
your
millions
we
be
better
friends
at
a
distance
you
a
funny
girl
gussie
a
short
time
after
this
conversation
i
had
trouble
with
the
union
of
which
gussie
was
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
loyal
members
the
cause
of
the
conflict
was
an
operator
named
blitt
a
native
of
antomir
who
had
been
working
in
my
shop
for
some
months
he
was
a
spare
little
fellow
with
a
nose
so
compressed
at
the
nostrils
that
it
looked
as
though
it
was
inhaling
some
sharp
pleasant
odor
it
gave
his
face
a
droll
appearance
but
his
eyes
dark
and
large
were
very
attractive
i
had
known
him
as
a
small
boy
in
my
birthplace
where
he
belonged
to
a
much
better
family
than
i
when
blitt
was
invited
to
join
the
levinsky
antomir
society
of
my
employees
he
refused
it
turned
out
that
he
was
one
of
the
active
spirits
of
the
union
and
also
an
ardent
member
of
the
socialist
party
his
foreman
had
not
the
courage
to
discharge
him
because
of
my
predilection
for
natives
of
antomir
so
he
reported
him
to
me
as
a
dangerous
fellow
he
is
going
to
blow
up
the
building
is
he
i
said
lightly
but
he
may
do
other
mischief
he
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
union
let
him
lead
the
next
time
i
looked
at
blitt
i
felt
uncomfortable
his
refusal
to
join
my
antomir
organization
hurt
me
and
his
activities
in
the
union
and
at
socialist
gatherings
kindled
my
rancor
his
compressed
nose
revolted
me
now
i
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
not
that
i
had
remained
inflexible
in
my
views
regarding
the
distribution
of
wealth
in
the
world
some
of
the
people
in
the
country
were
openly
taking
the
ground
that
the
poor
man
was
not
getting
a
square
deal
to
sympathize
with
organized
labor
was
no
longer
bad
form
some
society
women
even
doing
picket
duty
for
jewish
out
on
strike
socialism
which
used
to
be
declared
utterly
had
come
to
be
almost
a
vogue
american
colleges
were
leavened
with
it
while
american
magazines
were
building
up
stupendous
circulations
by
exposing
the
corruption
of
the
mighty
public
opinion
had
during
the
past
two
decades
undergone
a
striking
change
in
this
respect
i
had
watched
that
change
and
i
could
not
but
be
influenced
by
it
for
all
my
theorizing
about
the
survival
of
the
fittest
and
the
dying
off
of
the
weaklings
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
in
an
abstract
way
the
socialists
were
not
altogether
wrong
the
case
was
different
however
when
i
considered
it
in
connection
with
the
concrete
struggle
of
which
among
the
jewish
immigrants
was
practically
but
another
name
for
socialism
against
low
wages
or
high
rent
i
must
confess
too
that
the
defeat
with
which
i
had
met
at
tevkin
house
had
greatly
intensified
my
hostility
to
socialists
as
i
have
remarked
in
a
previous
chapter
i
ascribed
my
fiasco
to
the
socialist
atmosphere
that
surrounded
anna
i
was
embittered
the
socialists
were
constantly
harping
on
class
struggle
class
antagonism
class
psychology
i
would
dismiss
it
all
as
absurd
but
i
did
hate
the
particularly
those
of
the
east
side
altogether
there
was
too
much
socialism
among
the
masses
of
the
ghetto
i
thought
blitt
now
seemed
to
be
the
embodiment
of
this
class
antagonism
ah
he
wo
join
my
antomir
society
i
would
storm
and
fume
and
writhe
inwardly
that
a
tacit
protest
against
the
whole
society
as
an
organization
of
it
means
that
the
society
makes
meek
obedient
servants
of
my
employees
and
helps
me
fleece
them
as
if
they
did
not
earn
in
my
shop
more
than
they
would
anywhere
else
as
if
they
could
all
get
steady
work
outside
my
place
and
what
about
the
loans
and
all
sorts
of
other
favors
they
get
from
me
if
they
worked
for
their
own
fathers
they
could
not
be
treated
better
than
they
are
treated
here
i
felt
outraged
i
rebuked
myself
for
making
much
ado
about
nothing
indeed
this
was
a
growing
weakness
with
me
some
trifle
unworthy
of
consideration
would
get
on
my
nerves
and
bother
me
like
a
grain
of
sand
in
the
eye
was
i
getting
old
but
no
i
felt
in
the
prime
of
life
full
of
vigor
and
more
active
and
more
alive
to
the
passions
than
a
youth
whenever
i
chanced
to
be
on
the
floor
where
blitt
worked
i
would
avoid
looking
in
his
direction
his
presence
irritated
me
how
ridiculous
i
often
thought
one
would
imagine
he
my
conscience
and
that
why
i
want
to
get
rid
of
him
as
a
consequence
i
dared
not
send
him
away
and
as
a
consequence
of
this
he
irritated
me
more
than
ever
finally
one
afternoon
acting
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
called
his
foreman
to
me
and
told
him
to
discharge
him
a
committee
of
the
union
called
on
me
i
refused
to
deal
with
them
the
upshot
was
a
strike
not
merely
for
the
return
of
blitt
to
my
employment
but
also
for
higher
wages
and
the
recognition
of
the
union
the
organization
was
not
strong
and
only
a
small
number
of
my
men
were
members
of
it
but
when
these
went
out
all
the
others
followed
their
contagious
example
the
members
of
my
antomir
society
not
excepted
the
police
gave
me
ample
protection
and
there
were
thousands
of
who
remained
outside
the
union
so
that
i
soon
had
all
the
hands
i
wanted
but
the
conflict
caused
me
all
sorts
of
other
mortifications
for
one
thing
it
gave
me
no
end
of
hostile
publicity
the
socialist
yiddish
daily
which
had
an
overwhelmingly
wide
circulation
now
printed
reports
of
meetings
at
which
i
had
been
hissed
and
hooted
i
was
accused
of
bribing
corrupt
politicians
who
were
supposed
to
help
me
suppress
the
strike
by
means
of
police
clubs
i
was
charged
with
bringing
disgrace
upon
the
jewish
people
the
thought
of
tevkin
reading
these
reports
and
of
anna
hearing
of
them
hurt
me
cruelly
i
could
see
moissey
reveling
in
the
hisses
with
which
my
name
was
greeted
and
elsie
did
she
take
part
in
some
of
the
demonstrations
against
me
were
she
and
anna
collecting
funds
for
my
striking
employees
the
reports
in
the
american
papers
also
were
inclined
to
favor
the
strikers
public
opinion
was
against
me
what
galled
me
worse
than
all
perhaps
was
the
sympathy
shown
for
the
strikers
by
some
financiers
and
philanthropists
men
whose
acquaintance
it
was
the
height
of
my
ambition
to
cultivate
all
of
which
only
served
to
pour
oil
into
the
flames
of
my
hatred
for
the
union
bender
implored
me
to
settle
the
strike
the
union
does
amount
to
a
row
of
pins
he
urged
a
week
or
two
after
we
settle
things
will
get
back
to
their
old
state
where
your
backbone
bender
i
exploded
if
you
had
your
way
those
fellows
would
run
the
whole
business
you
have
no
sense
of
dignity
and
yet
you
were
born
in
america
i
was
always
accompanied
by
a
detective
one
of
the
strikers
was
in
my
pay
every
morning
at
a
fixed
hour
he
would
call
at
a
certain
hotel
where
he
reported
the
doings
of
the
organization
to
bender
and
myself
one
of
the
things
i
thus
learned
was
that
the
union
was
hard
up
and
constantly
exacting
loans
from
gussie
and
several
other
members
who
had
accounts
one
day
however
when
the
secretary
appealed
to
her
for
a
further
loan
with
which
to
pay
fines
for
arrested
pickets
and
assist
some
of
the
neediest
strikers
she
flew
into
a
passion
what
do
you
want
of
me
murderers
that
you
are
she
cried
bursting
into
tears
have
i
done
enough
have
you
no
hearts
a
minute
or
two
later
she
yielded
bleed
me
bleed
me
cruel
people
that
you
are
she
said
pointing
at
her
heart
as
she
started
toward
her
savings
bank
i
was
moved
when
my
spy
had
departed
i
paced
the
floor
for
some
minutes
then
pausing
i
smilingly
declared
to
bender
my
determination
to
ask
the
union
for
a
committee
he
was
overjoyed
and
shook
my
hand
solemnly
one
of
my
bookkeepers
was
to
communicate
with
the
strike
committee
in
the
afternoon
two
hours
before
the
time
set
for
their
meeting
i
saw
in
one
of
the
afternoon
papers
an
interview
with
the
president
of
the
union
his
statements
were
so
unjust
to
me
i
thought
and
so
bitter
that
the
fighting
blood
was
again
up
in
my
veins
but
the
image
of
gussie
giving
her
money
to
help
the
strikers
haunted
me
the
next
morning
i
went
to
atlantic
city
for
a
few
days
letting
bender
do
as
he
pleased
the
strike
was
compromised
the
men
obtaining
a
partial
concession
of
their
demands
and
blitt
waiving
his
claim
to
his
former
job
chapter
vi
my
business
continued
to
grow
my
consumption
of
raw
material
reached
gigantic
dimensions
so
much
so
that
at
times
when
i
liked
a
pattern
i
would
buy
up
the
entire
output
and
sell
some
of
it
to
smaller
manufacturers
at
a
profit
gradually
i
abandoned
the
higher
grades
of
goods
developing
my
whole
business
along
the
lines
of
popular
prices
there
are
two
houses
that
make
a
specialty
of
costly
garments
these
enjoy
high
reputations
for
taste
and
are
the
real
arbiters
of
fashion
in
this
country
one
of
the
two
being
known
in
the
trade
as
little
pans
but
the
combined
volume
of
business
of
both
these
firms
is
much
smaller
than
mine
my
deals
with
one
mill
alone
the
largest
in
the
country
and
the
one
whose
head
had
come
to
my
rescue
when
my
affairs
were
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
now
exceeded
a
million
dollars
at
a
single
purchase
to
be
delivered
in
seven
months
the
mills
often
sell
me
at
a
figure
considerably
lower
than
the
general
market
price
they
do
so
first
because
of
the
enormous
quantities
i
buy
and
second
because
of
the
boost
a
fabric
receives
from
the
very
fact
of
being
handled
by
my
house
one
day
for
instance
i
said
to
the
president
of
a
certain
mill
i
like
this
cloth
of
yours
i
feel
like
making
a
big
thing
of
it
provided
you
can
let
me
have
an
inside
figure
we
came
to
terms
and
i
gave
him
an
advance
order
for
nine
thousand
pieces
when
smaller
manufacturers
and
buyers
heard
that
i
had
bought
an
immense
quantity
of
that
pattern
its
success
was
practically
established
as
a
consequence
the
mill
was
in
a
position
to
raise
the
price
of
the
cloth
to
others
so
that
it
amply
made
up
for
the
low
figure
at
which
it
had
sold
the
goods
to
me
judged
by
the
market
price
of
the
raw
material
my
profit
on
a
garment
did
not
exceed
fifty
cents
but
i
paid
for
the
raw
material
cents
less
than
the
market
price
so
that
my
total
profit
was
one
dollar
and
cents
still
there
have
been
instances
when
i
lost
thousand
dollars
in
one
month
because
goods
fell
in
price
or
because
a
certain
style
failed
to
move
and
i
had
to
sell
it
below
cost
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
to
be
sure
cheaper
goods
are
less
likely
to
be
affected
by
the
caprices
of
style
than
higher
grades
which
is
one
of
several
reasons
why
i
prefer
to
produce
garments
of
popular
prices
i
do
not
employ
my
entire
capital
in
my
cloak
business
half
of
it
or
more
being
invested
in
quick
assets
should
i
need
more
ready
cash
than
i
have
i
could
procure
it
at
a
lower
rate
than
what
those
assets
bring
me
i
can
get
half
a
million
dollars
from
two
banks
without
rising
from
my
desk
by
merely
calling
those
banks
up
on
the
telephone
for
this
i
pay
say
three
and
a
half
or
four
per
for
i
am
a
desirable
customer
at
the
banks
and
as
my
quick
assets
bring
me
an
average
of
five
per
i
make
at
least
one
per
cent
on
the
money
another
way
of
making
my
money
breed
money
is
by
early
payments
to
the
mills
not
only
can
i
do
without
their
credit
but
i
can
afford
to
pay
them
six
months
in
advance
this
gives
me
an
anticipation
allowance
at
the
rate
of
six
per
cent
per
annum
while
money
costs
me
at
the
banks
three
or
four
per
cent
per
annum
all
this
is
good
sport
i
own
considerable
stock
in
the
very
mills
with
which
i
do
business
which
has
a
certain
moral
effect
on
their
relations
with
my
house
for
a
similar
purpose
i
am
a
shareholder
in
the
large
houses
that
buy
cloaks
and
suits
of
me
i
hold
shares
of
some
department
stores
also
but
of
late
i
have
grown
somewhat
shy
of
this
kind
of
investment
the
future
of
a
department
store
being
as
uncertain
as
the
future
of
the
neighborhood
in
which
it
is
located
houses
on
the
other
hand
have
the
whole
country
before
them
and
their
overwhelming
growth
during
past
years
was
one
of
the
conspicuous
phenomena
in
the
business
life
of
the
nation
i
love
to
watch
their
operations
spread
over
the
map
and
i
love
to
watch
the
growth
of
american
cities
the
shifting
of
their
shopping
centers
the
consequent
vicissitudes
the
decline
of
some
houses
the
rise
of
others
american
jews
of
german
origin
are
playing
a
foremost
part
in
the
retail
business
of
the
country
large
or
small
and
our
people
russian
and
galician
jews
also
are
making
themselves
felt
in
it
being
in
many
cases
in
partnership
with
gentiles
or
with
their
own
coreligionists
of
german
descent
the
king
of
the
great
business
a
man
with
an
annual
income
of
many
millions
is
the
son
of
a
polish
jew
he
is
one
of
the
two
richest
jews
in
america
having
built
up
his
vast
fortune
in
ten
or
fifteen
years
as
i
have
said
before
i
know
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
merchants
jews
and
gentiles
throughout
this
country
and
canada
so
i
like
to
keep
track
of
their
careers
this
too
is
good
sport
of
course
it
is
essential
to
study
the
business
map
in
the
interests
of
my
own
establishment
but
i
find
intellectual
excitement
in
it
as
well
and
after
all
i
am
essentially
an
intellectual
man
i
think
there
are
retailers
in
various
sections
of
the
country
whom
i
have
helped
financially
former
buyers
for
example
who
went
into
business
on
their
own
hook
with
my
assistance
this
is
good
business
for
while
these
merchants
must
be
left
free
to
buy
in
the
open
market
they
naturally
give
my
house
precedence
but
here
again
i
must
say
in
fairness
to
myself
that
business
interest
is
not
the
only
motive
that
induces
me
to
do
them
these
favors
indeed
in
some
cases
i
do
it
without
even
expecting
to
get
my
money
back
it
gives
me
moral
satisfaction
for
which
money
is
no
measure
of
value
chapter
vii
am
i
happy
there
are
moments
when
i
am
overwhelmed
by
a
sense
of
my
success
and
ease
i
become
aware
that
thousands
of
things
which
had
formerly
been
forbidden
fruit
to
me
are
at
my
command
now
i
distinctly
recall
that
crushing
sense
of
being
debarred
from
everything
and
then
i
feel
as
though
the
whole
world
were
mine
one
day
i
paused
in
front
of
an
old
east
side
restaurant
that
i
had
often
passed
in
my
days
of
need
and
despair
the
feeling
of
desolation
and
envy
with
which
i
used
to
peek
in
its
windows
came
back
to
me
it
gave
me
pangs
of
for
my
past
and
a
thrilling
sense
of
my
present
power
the
prices
that
had
once
been
prohibitive
seemed
so
wretchedly
low
now
on
another
occasion
i
came
across
a
canal
street
merchant
of
whom
i
used
to
buy
goods
for
my
i
said
to
myself
there
was
a
time
when
i
used
to
implore
this
man
for
ten
dollars
worth
of
goods
when
i
regarded
him
as
and
feared
him
now
he
would
be
happy
to
shake
hands
with
me
i
recalled
other
people
whom
i
used
to
fear
and
before
whom
i
used
to
humiliate
myself
because
of
my
poverty
i
thought
of
the
time
when
i
had
already
entered
the
cloak
business
but
was
struggling
and
squirming
and
constantly
racking
my
brains
for
some
way
of
raising
a
hundred
dollars
when
i
would
cringe
with
a
certain
east
side
banker
and
vainly
beg
him
to
extend
a
small
note
of
mine
and
come
away
in
a
sickening
state
of
despair
at
this
moment
as
these
memories
were
filing
by
me
i
felt
as
though
now
there
were
nobody
in
the
world
who
could
inspire
me
with
awe
or
render
me
a
service
and
yet
in
all
such
instances
i
feel
a
peculiar
yearning
for
the
very
days
when
the
doors
of
that
restaurant
were
closed
to
me
and
when
the
canal
street
merchant
was
a
magnate
of
commerce
in
my
estimation
somehow
encounters
of
this
kind
leave
me
dejected
the
gloomiest
past
is
dearer
than
the
brightest
present
in
my
case
there
seems
to
be
a
special
reason
for
feeling
this
way
my
sense
of
triumph
is
coupled
with
a
brooding
sense
of
emptiness
and
insignificance
of
my
lack
of
anything
like
a
great
deep
interest
i
am
lonely
amid
the
pandemonium
of
my
six
hundred
and
the
jingle
of
gold
which
they
pour
into
my
lap
i
feel
the
deadly
silence
of
solitude
i
spend
at
least
one
evening
a
week
at
the
benders
i
am
fond
of
their
children
and
i
feel
pleasantly
at
home
at
their
house
i
am
a
frequent
caller
at
the
nodelmans
and
enjoy
their
hospitality
even
more
than
that
of
the
benders
i
go
to
the
opera
to
the
theaters
and
to
concerts
and
never
alone
there
are
merry
suppers
and
some
orgies
in
which
i
take
part
but
when
i
go
home
i
suffer
a
gnawing
aftermath
of
loneliness
and
desolation
i
have
a
fine
summer
home
with
servants
automobiles
and
horses
i
share
it
with
the
bender
family
and
we
often
have
visitors
from
the
city
but
no
matter
how
large
and
gay
the
crowd
may
be
the
country
makes
me
sad
i
know
bachelors
who
are
thoroughly
reconciled
to
their
solitude
and
even
enjoy
it
i
am
not
no
i
am
not
happy
in
the
city
i
occupy
a
luxurious
suite
of
rooms
in
a
hotel
and
keep
an
excellent
chauffeur
and
valet
i
give
myself
every
comfort
that
money
can
buy
but
there
is
one
thing
which
i
crave
and
which
money
can
not
buy
happiness
many
a
pretty
girl
is
setting
her
cap
at
me
but
i
know
that
it
is
only
my
dollars
they
want
to
marry
nor
do
i
care
for
any
of
them
while
the
woman
to
whom
my
heart
is
calling
anna
is
married
to
another
man
i
dream
of
marrying
some
day
i
dread
to
think
of
dying
a
lonely
man
sometimes
i
have
a
spell
of
morbid
amativeness
and
seem
to
be
falling
in
love
with
woman
after
woman
there
are
periods
when
i
can
scarcely
pass
a
woman
in
the
street
without
scanning
her
face
and
figure
when
i
see
the
crowds
returning
from
work
in
the
district
i
often
pause
to
watch
the
groups
of
girls
as
they
walk
apart
from
the
men
their
keeping
together
as
if
they
formed
a
separate
world
full
of
its
own
interests
and
secrets
makes
a
peculiar
appeal
to
me
once
in
florida
i
thought
i
was
falling
in
love
with
a
rich
jewish
girl
whose
face
had
a
bashful
expression
of
a
peculiar
type
there
are
different
sorts
of
bashfulness
this
girl
had
the
bashfulness
of
sin
as
i
put
it
to
myself
she
looked
as
if
her
mind
harbored
illicit
thoughts
which
she
was
trying
to
conceal
her
blushes
seemed
to
be
full
of
sex
and
her
eyes
full
of
secrets
she
was
not
a
pretty
girl
at
all
but
her
guilty
look
disturbed
me
as
long
as
we
were
stopping
in
the
same
place
but
through
all
these
ephemeral
infatuations
and
interests
i
am
in
love
with
anna
from
time
to
time
i
decide
to
make
a
sensible
marriage
and
study
this
woman
or
that
as
a
possible
candidate
but
so
far
nothing
has
come
of
it
there
was
one
woman
whom
i
might
have
married
if
she
had
not
been
a
gentile
one
of
the
very
few
who
lived
in
the
family
hotel
in
which
i
had
my
apartments
at
first
i
set
her
down
for
an
adventuress
seeking
the
acquaintance
of
rich
jews
for
some
sinister
purpose
but
i
was
mistaken
she
was
a
woman
of
high
character
moreover
she
and
her
aged
mother
with
whom
she
lived
had
settled
in
that
hotel
long
before
it
came
to
be
patronized
by
our
people
she
was
a
widow
of
over
forty
with
a
good
intellectual
face
well
read
in
the
better
sense
of
the
term
and
no
fool
many
of
our
people
in
the
hotel
danced
attendance
upon
her
because
she
was
a
gentile
woman
but
all
of
them
were
really
fond
of
her
the
great
point
was
that
she
seemed
to
have
a
sincere
liking
for
our
people
this
and
the
peculiar
way
her
shoulders
would
shake
when
she
laughed
was
in
fact
what
first
drew
me
to
her
we
grew
chummy
and
i
spent
many
an
hour
in
her
company
in
my
soliloquies
i
often
speculated
and
theorized
on
the
question
of
proposing
to
her
i
saw
clearly
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
it
was
not
the
faith
of
my
fathers
that
was
in
the
way
it
was
that
medieval
prejudice
against
our
people
which
makes
so
many
marriages
between
jew
and
gentile
a
failure
it
frightened
me
one
evening
we
sat
chatting
in
the
bright
lobby
of
the
hotel
discussing
human
nature
and
she
telling
me
something
of
the
good
novels
she
had
read
after
a
brief
pause
i
said
i
enjoy
these
talks
immensely
i
think
there
is
another
person
with
whom
i
so
love
to
talk
of
human
beings
she
bowed
with
a
smile
that
shone
of
something
more
than
mere
appreciation
of
the
compliment
and
then
i
uttered
in
the
simplest
possible
accents
it
really
a
pity
that
there
is
the
chasm
of
race
between
us
otherwise
i
do
see
why
we
could
be
happy
together
i
was
in
an
adventurous
mood
and
ready
even
eager
to
marry
her
but
her
answer
was
a
laugh
as
if
she
took
it
for
a
joke
and
though
i
seemed
to
sense
intimacy
and
encouragement
in
that
laugh
it
gave
me
pause
i
felt
on
the
brink
of
a
fatal
blunder
and
i
escaped
before
it
was
too
late
but
then
i
hastened
to
add
real
happiness
in
a
case
like
this
is
perhaps
not
the
rule
but
the
exception
that
chasm
continues
to
yawn
throughout
the
couple
married
life
i
suppose
that
an
interesting
point
of
view
she
said
a
smile
on
her
lips
she
tactfully
forbore
to
take
up
the
discussion
and
i
soon
dropped
the
subject
we
remained
friends
it
was
this
woman
who
got
me
interested
in
good
modern
fiction
the
books
she
selected
for
me
interested
me
greatly
then
it
was
that
the
remarks
i
had
heard
from
moissey
tevkin
came
to
my
mind
they
were
illuminating
most
of
the
people
at
my
hotel
are
jews
i
know
other
jews
of
this
class
i
contribute
to
their
charity
institutions
though
an
atheist
i
belong
to
one
of
their
synagogues
nor
can
i
plead
the
special
feeling
which
had
partly
accounted
for
my
visits
at
the
synagogue
of
the
sons
of
antomir
while
i
was
engaged
to
kaplan
daughter
i
am
a
member
of
that
synagogue
chiefly
because
it
is
a
fashionable
synagogue
i
often
convict
myself
of
currying
favor
with
the
german
jews
but
then
jews
curry
favor
with
jews
just
as
we
all
curry
favor
with
gentiles
and
as
american
gentiles
curry
favor
with
the
aristocracy
of
europe
i
often
long
for
a
talk
with
some
of
the
people
of
my
birthplace
i
have
tried
to
revive
my
old
friendships
with
some
of
them
but
they
are
mostly
poor
and
my
prosperity
stands
between
us
in
many
ways
sometimes
when
i
am
alone
in
my
beautiful
apartments
brooding
over
these
things
and
nursing
my
loneliness
i
say
to
myself
there
are
cases
when
success
is
a
tragedy
there
are
moments
when
i
regret
my
whole
career
when
my
very
success
seems
to
be
a
mistake
i
think
that
i
was
born
for
a
life
of
intellectual
interest
i
was
certainly
brought
up
for
one
the
day
when
that
accident
turned
my
mind
from
college
to
business
seems
to
be
the
most
unfortunate
day
in
my
life
i
think
that
i
should
be
much
happier
as
a
scientist
or
writer
perhaps
i
should
then
be
in
my
natural
element
and
if
i
were
doomed
to
loneliness
i
should
have
comforts
to
which
i
am
now
a
stranger
that
the
way
i
feel
every
time
i
pass
the
abandoned
old
building
of
the
city
college
the
business
world
contains
plenty
of
successful
men
who
have
no
brains
why
then
should
i
ascribe
my
triumph
to
special
ability
i
should
probably
have
made
a
much
better
college
professor
than
a
and
should
probably
be
a
happier
man
too
i
know
people
who
have
made
much
more
money
than
i
and
whom
i
consider
my
inferiors
in
every
respect
many
of
our
immigrants
have
distinguished
themselves
in
science
music
or
art
and
these
i
envy
far
more
than
i
do
a
billionaire
as
an
example
of
the
successes
achieved
by
russian
jews
in
america
in
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
it
is
often
pointed
out
that
the
man
who
has
built
the
greatest
in
the
country
including
the
woolworth
building
is
a
russian
jew
who
came
here
a
penniless
boy
i
can
not
boast
such
distinction
but
then
i
have
helped
build
up
one
of
the
great
industries
of
the
united
states
and
this
also
is
something
to
be
proud
of
but
i
should
readily
change
places
with
the
russian
jew
a
former
talmud
student
like
myself
who
is
the
greatest
physiologist
in
the
new
world
or
with
the
russian
jew
who
holds
the
foremost
place
among
american
and
whose
soulful
compositions
are
sung
in
almost
every
house
in
the
world
i
love
music
to
madness
i
yearn
for
the
world
of
great
singers
violinists
pianists
several
of
the
greatest
of
them
are
of
my
race
and
country
and
i
have
met
them
but
all
my
acquaintance
with
them
has
brought
me
is
a
sense
of
being
looked
down
upon
as
a
striving
to
play
the
maćcenas
i
had
a
similar
experience
with
a
sculptor
also
one
of
our
immigrants
an
east
side
boy
who
had
met
with
sensational
success
in
paris
and
london
i
had
him
make
my
bust
his
demeanor
toward
me
was
all
that
could
have
been
desired
we
even
cracked
yiddish
jokes
together
and
he
hummed
bits
of
synagogue
music
over
his
work
but
i
never
left
his
studio
without
feeling
cheap
and
wretched
when
i
think
of
these
things
when
i
am
in
this
sort
of
mood
i
pity
myself
for
a
victim
of
circumstances
at
the
height
of
my
business
success
i
feel
that
if
i
had
my
life
to
live
over
again
i
should
never
think
of
a
