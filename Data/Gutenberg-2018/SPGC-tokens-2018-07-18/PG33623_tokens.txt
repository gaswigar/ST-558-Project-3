the
inventions
of
the
idiot
i
the
culinary
guild
it
was
before
the
idiot
marriage
and
in
the
days
when
he
was
nothing
more
than
a
plain
boarder
in
home
for
single
gentlemen
that
he
put
what
the
termed
his
alleged
mind
on
plans
for
the
amelioration
of
the
condition
of
the
civilized
the
trials
of
the
barbarian
are
really
nothing
as
compared
with
the
tribulations
of
civilized
man
he
said
as
the
waitress
passed
him
a
piece
of
steak
that
had
been
burned
to
a
crisp
in
the
cannibal
islands
a
cook
who
would
send
a
piece
of
broiled
missionary
to
her
table
in
this
condition
would
herself
be
roasted
before
another
day
had
dawned
we
however
must
grin
and
bear
it
because
our
esteemed
landlady
can
not
find
anywhere
in
this
town
a
woman
better
suited
for
the
labors
of
the
kitchen
than
the
blank
she
has
had
the
misfortune
to
draw
in
the
culinary
lottery
familiarly
known
to
us
her
victims
as
bridget
this
is
an
exceptional
case
said
pedagog
we
have
had
a
steak
like
this
before
in
several
weeks
true
returned
the
idiot
this
is
a
sirloin
i
believe
the
last
steak
we
had
was
a
rump
steak
and
it
was
not
burned
to
a
crisp
i
admit
it
was
only
boiled
if
i
remember
rightly
by
mistake
bridget
having
lost
her
fifth
consecutive
cousin
in
ten
days
the
night
before
and
being
in
consequence
so
prostrated
that
she
could
not
tell
a
gridiron
from
a
well
you
know
the
popular
superstition
mr
idiot
said
the
poet
the
devil
sends
the
cooks
i
do
believe
it
retorted
the
idiot
that
one
of
those
proverbs
that
have
a
particle
of
truth
in
nor
a
foundation
in
reason
either
like
look
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth
of
all
absurd
advice
ever
given
to
man
by
a
thoughtless
thinker
that
i
think
bears
the
palm
i
know
a
man
who
did
look
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth
and
the
consequence
was
that
he
accepted
a
horse
that
was
years
old
the
beast
died
in
his
stables
three
days
later
and
the
beneficiary
had
to
pay
five
dollars
to
have
him
carted
away
as
for
the
devil
sending
the
cooks
i
have
any
faith
in
the
theory
any
person
who
had
come
from
the
devil
would
know
how
to
manage
a
fire
better
than
per
cent
of
the
cooks
ever
born
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
every
one
of
were
forced
to
serve
an
apprenticeship
with
the
prince
of
darkness
however
steak
like
this
serves
a
good
purpose
it
serves
to
bind
our
little
circle
more
firmly
together
there
nothing
like
mutual
suffering
to
increase
the
sympathy
that
should
exist
between
men
situated
as
we
are
and
as
for
i
wish
her
to
understand
distinctly
that
i
am
criticising
the
cook
and
not
herself
if
this
particular
dainty
had
been
prepared
by
her
own
fair
hand
i
doubt
not
i
should
want
more
of
it
i
thank
you
returned
the
landlady
somewhat
mollified
by
this
remark
if
i
had
more
time
i
should
occasionally
do
the
cooking
myself
but
as
it
is
i
am
overwhelmed
with
work
i
can
bear
witness
to
that
observed
whitechoker
is
one
of
the
most
useful
ladies
in
my
congregation
if
it
were
not
for
her
many
a
heathen
would
be
going
without
garments
well
i
do
like
to
criticise
said
the
idiot
but
i
think
the
heathen
at
home
should
be
considered
before
the
heathen
abroad
if
your
congregation
would
have
a
guild
to
look
after
such
heathen
as
the
poet
and
the
doctor
and
myself
i
am
convinced
it
would
be
more
appreciated
by
those
who
benefited
by
its
labors
than
it
is
at
present
by
the
barbarians
who
try
to
wear
the
misfits
it
sends
out
a
christian
whose
plain
but
honest
breakfast
is
well
cooked
is
apt
to
be
far
more
grateful
than
a
barbarian
who
is
wearing
a
pair
of
trousers
made
of
calico
and
a
coat
three
sizes
too
small
in
the
body
and
nine
sizes
too
large
in
the
arms
i
will
go
further
i
believe
that
if
the
domestic
heathen
were
cared
for
they
would
do
much
better
work
would
earn
better
pay
and
would
out
of
mere
gratitude
set
apart
a
sufficiently
large
portion
of
their
increased
earnings
to
be
devoted
to
the
purchase
of
costumes
which
would
please
the
cannibals
better
far
better
than
the
amateur
creations
they
now
get
i
know
i
contribute
some
of
my
surplus
what
would
you
have
such
a
guild
do
queried
whitechoker
do
there
be
so
much
for
it
to
do
that
the
members
could
hardly
find
time
to
rest
returned
the
idiot
do
why
my
dear
sir
take
this
house
for
instance
and
see
what
it
could
do
here
what
a
boon
it
would
be
for
me
if
some
person
would
come
here
once
a
week
and
sew
buttons
on
my
clothes
darn
my
socks
in
short
keep
me
mended
what
better
work
for
one
who
desires
to
make
the
world
brighter
happier
and
less
sinful
i
fail
to
see
how
the
world
would
be
brighter
happier
or
less
sinful
if
your
were
kept
firm
and
your
stockings
darned
and
your
wardrobe
generally
mended
said
pedagog
i
grant
that
such
a
guild
would
be
doing
a
noble
work
if
it
would
take
you
in
hand
and
correct
many
of
your
impressions
revise
your
facts
so
as
to
bring
them
more
in
accord
with
indubitable
truths
and
impart
to
your
customs
some
of
that
polish
which
you
so
earnestly
strive
for
in
your
dress
thank
you
said
the
idiot
suavely
but
i
do
wish
to
overburden
the
kind
ladies
to
whom
i
refer
if
my
costumes
could
be
looked
after
i
might
find
time
to
look
after
my
customs
and
i
assure
you
pedagog
if
at
any
time
you
will
undertake
to
deliver
a
course
of
lectures
on
etiquette
i
will
gladly
subscribe
for
two
and
endeavor
to
occupy
both
of
them
at
any
rate
to
return
to
the
main
point
i
claim
that
the
world
would
be
happier
and
brighter
and
less
sinful
if
the
domestic
heathen
were
kept
mended
by
such
a
guild
and
i
challenge
any
one
here
to
deny
even
on
so
slight
a
basis
as
the
loose
the
truth
of
what
i
say
when
i
arise
in
the
morning
and
find
a
button
gone
do
i
make
genial
remarks
about
the
joys
of
life
i
do
not
i
use
words
sometimes
one
word
which
need
not
be
repeated
here
i
am
unhappy
and
being
unhappy
the
world
seems
dark
and
dreary
and
in
speaking
impatiently
though
very
much
to
the
point
as
i
do
i
am
guilty
of
an
offence
that
is
sinful
with
such
a
start
in
the
morning
i
come
here
to
the
table
pedagog
sees
that
i
am
not
quite
myself
he
asks
me
if
i
am
not
feeling
well
an
irritating
question
at
any
time
but
particularly
so
to
a
man
with
a
gone
i
retort
he
until
our
converse
is
warmer
than
the
coffee
and
our
relations
colder
than
the
waffles
finally
i
leave
the
house
slamming
the
door
behind
me
structurally
weakening
the
house
and
go
to
business
where
i
wreak
my
vengeance
upon
the
second
clerk
who
takes
it
out
of
the
who
goes
home
and
vents
his
wrath
on
his
little
sister
who
goaded
into
recklessness
teases
the
baby
until
he
yells
and
gets
spanked
by
his
mother
for
being
noisy
now
why
should
a
loose
be
allowed
to
subject
that
baby
to
such
humiliation
and
who
can
deny
that
if
it
had
been
properly
sewed
on
by
a
guild
such
as
i
have
mentioned
the
baby
never
would
have
been
spanked
for
the
causes
mentioned
what
is
answer
mr
whitechoker
truly
i
am
so
breathless
at
your
logic
that
i
can
not
reason
said
the
minister
but
have
we
digressed
a
little
we
were
speaking
of
cooks
and
we
conclude
with
a
pathetic
little
allegory
about
a
and
a
baby
that
is
not
only
teased
but
spanked
the
baby
could
get
the
same
spanking
for
reasons
based
on
the
shortcomings
of
the
cooks
said
the
idiot
i
am
irritated
when
i
am
served
with
green
pease
hard
enough
to
batter
down
gibraltar
if
properly
aimed
when
my
coffee
is
a
reminiscence
of
last
i
leave
the
house
in
a
frame
of
mind
that
bodes
ill
for
the
junior
clerk
and
the
effect
on
the
baby
is
ultimately
the
same
and
er
you
have
the
ladies
whose
energies
are
now
devoted
towards
the
clothing
of
the
heathen
come
here
and
do
the
cooking
queried
the
i
leave
if
they
do
said
the
doctor
i
have
seen
too
much
of
the
effects
of
amateur
cookery
in
my
profession
to
want
any
of
it
they
are
good
cooks
in
theory
but
not
in
practice
there
you
have
it
said
the
idiot
triumphantly
right
in
a
nutshell
that
where
the
cooks
are
always
weak
they
have
none
of
the
theory
and
all
of
the
practice
if
they
based
practice
on
theory
they
cook
better
wherefore
let
your
theoretical
cooks
seek
out
the
practical
and
instruct
them
in
the
principles
of
the
culinary
art
think
of
what
twelve
ladies
could
do
twelve
ladies
trained
in
the
to
talk
rapidly
working
five
hours
a
day
apiece
could
devote
an
hour
a
week
to
three
hundred
and
sixty
cooks
and
tell
them
practically
all
they
themselves
know
in
that
time
and
if
in
addition
to
this
twelve
other
ladies
forming
an
auxiliary
guild
would
make
dresses
and
bonnets
and
things
for
the
same
cooks
instead
of
for
the
cannibals
it
would
keep
them
splendid
scheme
said
the
doctor
so
practical
your
brain
must
weigh
half
an
ounce
i
never
had
it
weighed
said
the
idiot
but
i
fancy
it
a
good
one
it
the
only
one
i
have
anyhow
and
it
done
me
good
service
and
shows
no
signs
of
softening
but
returning
to
the
cooks
is
as
essential
to
the
making
of
a
good
cook
as
are
apples
to
the
making
of
a
dumpling
you
ca
associate
the
word
dumpling
with
and
just
as
the
poet
throws
himself
into
his
work
and
as
he
is
of
a
cheerful
or
a
mournful
disposition
so
does
his
work
appear
cheerful
or
mournful
so
do
the
productions
of
a
cook
take
on
the
attributes
of
their
maker
a
dyspeptic
cook
will
prepare
food
in
a
manner
so
indigestible
that
it
were
ruin
to
partake
of
it
a
cook
will
make
light
bread
a
pessimistic
cook
will
serve
flour
bricks
in
lieu
thereof
i
think
possibly
you
are
right
when
you
say
that
said
the
doctor
i
have
myself
observed
that
the
people
who
sing
at
their
work
do
the
best
work
but
the
worst
singing
growled
the
that
may
be
true
put
in
the
idiot
but
you
can
not
expect
a
cook
on
sixteen
dollars
a
month
to
be
a
now
if
whitechoker
will
undertake
to
start
a
in
his
church
for
people
who
do
care
to
wear
clothing
but
to
sow
the
seeds
of
concord
and
good
cookery
throughout
the
kitchens
of
this
land
i
am
prepared
to
prophesy
that
at
the
end
of
the
year
there
will
be
more
happiness
and
less
depression
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
once
eliminate
dyspepsia
from
our
midst
and
get
civilization
and
happiness
controvertible
terms
then
you
will
find
your
foreign
missionary
funds
waxing
so
fat
that
instead
of
the
amateur
garments
for
the
heathen
you
now
send
them
you
will
be
able
to
open
an
account
at
worth
and
poole
for
every
barbarian
in
creation
the
scheme
for
the
sewing
on
of
and
the
miscellaneous
mending
that
needs
to
be
done
for
savages
like
myself
might
be
left
in
abeyance
until
the
culinary
scheme
has
been
established
bachelors
constitute
a
class
a
small
class
only
of
humanity
but
the
regeneration
of
cooks
is
a
universal
need
i
think
your
scheme
is
certainly
a
picturesque
one
and
novel
said
whitechoker
there
seems
to
be
a
good
deal
in
it
do
you
think
so
mr
pedagog
yes
i
do
said
pedagog
wearily
a
great
deal
of
language
and
amid
the
laugh
at
his
expense
which
followed
the
idiot
joining
in
departed
ii
a
suggestion
for
the
sighed
the
idiot
rubbing
his
eyes
sleepily
this
is
a
weary
world
what
this
from
you
smiled
the
poet
i
never
expected
to
hear
that
plaint
from
a
man
of
your
cheerful
disposition
humph
said
the
idiot
with
difficulty
repressing
a
yawn
humph
and
i
may
add
likewise
tut
what
do
you
take
me
for
an
insulated
i
ca
help
it
if
shadows
camp
across
my
horizon
occasionally
i
would
give
a
cent
for
the
man
who
never
had
his
moments
of
misery
it
takes
night
to
enable
us
to
appreciate
daytime
misery
is
a
foil
necessary
to
the
full
appreciation
of
joy
i
glad
i
am
sort
of
down
in
the
mouth
i
be
all
right
and
i
enjoy
all
the
more
for
megrim
but
for
the
present
i
repeat
this
is
a
weary
world
oh
i
do
think
so
observed
the
the
world
seem
to
me
to
betray
any
signs
of
weariness
it
got
to
work
at
the
usual
hour
this
morning
and
as
far
as
i
can
judge
has
been
revolving
at
the
usual
rate
of
speed
ever
since
the
idiot
mistake
is
a
common
one
put
in
the
doctor
i
find
it
frequently
in
my
practice
that
a
confession
retorted
the
idiot
do
you
find
out
these
mistakes
in
your
practice
before
or
after
the
death
of
the
patient
that
mistake
continued
the
doctor
paying
apparently
little
heed
to
the
idiot
remark
that
mistake
lies
in
the
idiot
assumption
that
he
is
himself
the
world
he
regards
himself
as
the
earth
as
all
of
life
and
because
he
happens
to
be
weary
the
world
is
a
weary
one
it
is
a
fatal
disease
is
it
queried
the
idiot
anxiously
i
am
not
likely
to
become
so
impressed
with
that
idea
for
instance
that
i
shall
have
to
be
put
in
a
padded
cell
and
manacled
so
that
i
may
not
turn
perpetual
handsprings
under
the
hallucination
that
being
the
world
it
is
my
duty
to
revolve
no
replied
the
doctor
with
a
laugh
no
indeed
that
is
not
at
all
likely
to
happen
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
you
were
to
carry
the
hallucination
out
far
enough
to
put
a
cake
of
ice
on
your
head
assuming
that
to
be
the
north
pole
and
cool
off
that
brain
of
yours
that
is
a
good
idea
returned
the
idiot
and
if
mary
will
bring
me
the
ice
that
was
used
to
cool
the
coffee
this
morning
i
shall
be
pleased
to
try
the
experiment
meanwhile
this
is
a
weary
world
then
why
under
the
canopy
do
you
leave
it
and
go
to
some
other
world
snapped
pedagog
you
are
under
no
obligation
to
remain
here
with
a
river
on
either
side
of
the
city
and
a
new
york
juggernaut
company
unlimited
running
up
and
down
two
of
our
more
prominent
highways
suicide
is
within
the
reach
of
all
of
course
we
should
be
sorry
to
lose
you
in
a
way
but
i
have
known
men
to
recover
from
even
greater
afflictions
than
that
thank
you
for
the
suggestion
replied
the
idiot
transferring
four
large
porous
to
his
plate
thank
you
very
much
but
i
have
a
pleasanter
and
more
lingering
method
of
suicide
right
here
death
by
is
like
being
pierced
by
a
toledo
blade
you
do
not
realize
the
terrors
of
your
situation
until
you
cease
to
be
susceptible
to
them
furthermore
i
do
not
believe
in
suicide
it
is
in
my
judgment
the
worst
crime
a
man
can
commit
and
i
can
not
but
admire
the
remarkable
discernment
evinced
by
the
fates
in
making
of
it
its
own
inevitable
capital
punishment
a
man
may
commit
murder
and
escape
death
but
in
the
commission
of
suicide
he
is
sure
of
execution
just
as
virtue
is
its
own
reward
so
is
suicide
its
own
amercement
been
reading
the
dictionary
again
asked
the
poet
no
not
exactly
said
the
idiot
with
a
smile
but
it
a
kind
of
joke
on
me
i
suppose
i
have
just
been
stuck
to
use
a
polite
term
on
a
book
called
roget
and
if
i
want
to
get
hold
of
a
new
word
that
will
increase
my
seeming
importance
to
the
community
i
turn
to
it
that
where
i
got
i
do
hold
that
its
use
in
this
especial
case
is
beyond
cavil
that
another
thesaurian
term
but
i
do
suppose
any
one
here
would
notice
that
fact
it
goes
here
and
i
shall
not
use
it
elsewhere
i
am
interested
to
know
how
ever
came
to
be
the
owner
of
a
said
the
with
a
grim
smile
at
the
idea
of
the
idiot
having
such
a
book
in
his
possession
except
on
the
score
of
affinities
you
are
both
very
wordy
meaning
pleonastic
i
presume
retorted
the
idiot
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
never
mind
said
the
idiot
i
wo
press
the
analogy
but
i
will
say
that
those
who
are
themselves
periphrastic
should
avoid
criticising
others
for
being
ambaginous
i
think
you
mean
ambiguous
said
the
elevating
his
eyebrows
in
triumph
i
thought
you
think
that
retorted
the
idiot
that
why
i
used
the
word
i
lend
you
my
dictionary
to
freshen
up
your
phraseology
meanwhile
i
tell
you
how
i
happened
to
get
a
i
thought
it
was
an
animal
and
when
i
saw
that
a
new
york
bookseller
had
a
lot
of
them
marked
down
from
two
dollars
to
one
i
sent
and
got
one
i
thought
it
was
strange
for
a
bookseller
to
be
selling
rare
animals
but
that
was
his
business
not
mine
and
as
i
was
anxious
to
see
what
kind
of
a
creature
a
was
i
invested
when
i
found
out
it
was
a
book
and
not
a
tame
relic
of
the
antediluvian
animal
kingdom
i
thought
i
would
say
anything
about
it
but
you
people
here
are
so
inquisitive
you
learned
my
secret
and
was
it
an
animal
asked
my
dear
my
ejaculated
pedagog
pray
ah
i
beg
of
you
do
not
enter
into
this
discussion
no
pedagog
observed
the
idiot
it
was
not
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
book
which
when
once
you
have
read
it
you
would
not
be
without
since
it
gives
your
vocabulary
a
twist
which
makes
you
proof
against
out
of
every
one
hundred
conversationalists
in
the
world
no
matter
how
weak
your
cause
i
am
beginning
to
understand
the
causes
of
your
weariness
observed
pedagog
acridly
you
have
been
memorizing
syllables
really
i
should
think
you
were
in
danger
of
phonetic
prostration
not
a
bit
of
it
said
the
idiot
those
words
are
stimulating
not
depressing
i
begin
to
feel
better
already
now
that
i
have
spoken
them
i
am
not
half
so
weary
as
i
was
but
for
my
weariness
i
had
good
cause
i
suffered
all
night
from
a
most
frightful
nightmare
it
utterly
destroyed
my
rest
queried
the
genial
old
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibed
with
a
tone
of
reproach
if
so
why
was
i
not
with
you
that
question
should
be
its
own
answer
replied
the
idiot
a
man
who
will
eat
a
alone
is
not
only
a
person
of
a
sullen
disposition
but
of
reckless
mould
as
well
i
would
no
sooner
think
of
braving
a
unaccompanied
than
i
would
think
of
trying
to
swim
across
the
british
channel
without
a
lifesaving
boat
following
in
my
wake
i
question
if
so
light
a
body
as
you
could
have
a
wake
said
pedagog
coldly
i
am
sorry
but
i
ca
agree
with
you
pedagog
said
the
bibliomaniac
a
tugboat
most
insignificant
of
crafts
roils
up
the
surface
of
the
sea
more
than
an
ocean
steamer
does
fuss
goes
with
feathers
more
than
with
large
bodies
well
they
neither
of
in
it
with
a
cake
of
soap
for
real
suds
said
the
idiot
complacently
as
he
helped
himself
to
his
thirteenth
however
wakes
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
i
had
a
most
frightful
dream
and
it
was
not
due
to
but
to
my
fatal
weakness
which
not
having
my
at
hand
i
must
identify
by
the
commonplace
term
of
courtesy
you
may
not
have
noticed
it
but
courtesy
is
my
strong
point
we
have
observed
the
fact
said
pedagog
but
what
of
it
have
you
been
courteous
to
any
one
i
have
replied
the
idiot
and
a
nightmare
is
what
it
brought
me
i
rode
on
a
last
night
and
i
gave
up
my
seat
to
sixteen
ladies
two
of
whom
thanked
me
i
do
see
why
more
than
one
of
them
should
thank
you
sniffed
the
landlady
if
a
man
gives
up
a
seat
to
sixteen
ladies
only
one
of
them
can
occupy
it
i
stand
corrected
said
the
idiot
i
gave
up
a
seat
to
ladies
sixteen
times
between
city
hall
and
street
i
ca
bring
myself
to
sit
down
while
a
woman
stands
and
every
time
i
get
a
seat
some
woman
would
get
on
the
car
hence
it
was
that
i
gave
up
my
seat
to
sixteen
ladies
why
two
of
them
should
thank
me
considering
the
rules
i
do
not
know
it
certainly
is
not
the
custom
at
any
rate
if
i
had
walked
i
should
not
have
had
more
exercise
than
i
got
on
that
car
bobbing
up
and
down
so
many
times
and
lurching
here
and
lurching
there
every
time
the
car
stopped
started
or
turned
a
corner
whether
it
was
the
thanks
or
the
lurching
i
got
i
do
know
but
the
incidents
of
the
ride
were
so
strongly
impressed
upon
me
that
i
dreamed
all
night
only
in
my
dreams
i
was
not
giving
up
car
seats
the
first
seat
i
gave
up
to
a
woman
in
the
dream
was
an
seat
in
the
stock
exchange
it
was
expensive
courtesy
but
i
did
it
and
mourned
so
over
the
result
that
i
waked
up
and
discovered
that
it
was
but
a
dream
then
i
went
to
sleep
again
this
time
i
was
at
the
opera
i
had
the
best
seat
in
the
house
when
in
came
a
woman
who
had
a
chair
same
result
i
got
up
she
sat
down
and
i
had
to
stand
behind
a
pillar
where
i
could
neither
see
nor
hear
more
grief
waked
up
again
more
tired
than
when
i
went
to
bed
in
ten
minutes
i
dozed
off
found
myself
an
ambitious
statesman
running
for
the
presidency
was
elected
and
inaugurated
up
comes
a
woman
rights
candidate
more
courtesy
gave
up
the
presidential
chair
to
her
and
went
home
to
obscurity
when
again
i
awoke
tireder
than
ever
clock
struck
four
fell
asleep
again
this
time
i
was
prepared
for
anything
that
might
happen
i
found
myself
in
a
but
with
me
i
had
a
perforated
such
as
the
street
peddlers
sell
lady
got
aboard
i
put
the
perforated
on
my
lap
and
invited
her
to
sit
down
she
thanked
me
and
did
so
then
another
lady
got
on
the
lady
on
my
lap
moved
up
and
made
room
for
the
second
lady
she
sat
down
between
them
they
must
have
weighed
three
hundred
pounds
i
could
have
stood
that
but
as
time
went
on
more
ladies
got
aboard
and
every
time
that
happened
these
would
move
up
and
make
room
for
them
how
they
did
it
i
ca
say
any
more
than
i
can
say
how
in
real
life
three
women
can
find
room
in
a
vacated
by
a
little
child
they
did
the
former
just
as
they
do
the
latter
until
finally
i
found
myself
flattened
into
the
original
bench
like
the
pattern
figure
of
a
carpet
i
felt
like
an
entaglio
thirty
women
by
actual
count
were
pressing
me
to
remain
as
it
were
but
the
worst
of
it
all
was
they
none
of
them
seemed
to
live
anywhere
we
rode
on
and
on
and
on
but
nobody
got
off
i
tried
to
move
and
could
we
passed
my
corner
but
there
i
was
fixed
i
could
breathe
and
so
could
call
out
and
i
verily
believe
that
if
i
had
finally
waked
up
i
should
by
this
time
have
reached
for
i
have
a
distinct
recollection
of
passing
through
chicago
denver
san
francisco
and
honolulu
finally
i
did
wake
however
simply
worn
out
with
my
night
rest
which
gentlemen
is
why
i
say
as
i
have
already
said
this
is
a
weary
world
well
i
do
blame
you
said
whitechoker
kindly
that
was
a
most
remarkable
dream
yes
assented
pedagog
but
quite
in
line
with
his
waking
thoughts
very
likely
said
the
idiot
rising
and
preparing
to
depart
it
was
absurd
in
most
of
its
features
but
in
one
of
them
it
was
excellent
i
am
going
to
see
the
president
of
the
electric
juggernaut
company
as
you
call
it
in
regard
to
it
i
think
there
is
money
in
that
idea
of
having
an
extra
for
every
passenger
to
hold
in
his
lap
in
that
way
twice
as
many
seated
passengers
can
be
accommodated
and
countless
people
with
tender
feet
will
be
spared
the
pain
of
having
other
wayfarers
standing
upon
them
iii
the
transatlantic
trolley
company
if
i
were
a
millionaire
began
the
idiot
one
sunday
morning
as
he
and
his
friends
took
their
accustomed
seats
at
the
i
would
devote
a
tenth
of
my
income
to
the
poor
a
tenth
to
children
funds
and
the
balance
to
the
education
through
travel
of
a
dear
and
intimate
friend
of
mine
that
would
be
a
generous
distribution
of
your
wealth
said
whitechoker
graciously
but
upon
what
would
you
live
yourself
i
should
stipulate
in
the
bargain
with
my
dear
and
intimate
friend
that
we
should
be
inseparable
that
wherever
he
should
go
i
should
go
and
that
of
the
funds
devoted
to
his
education
through
travel
should
be
paid
to
me
as
my
commission
for
letting
him
into
a
good
thing
you
certainly
have
good
business
sense
put
in
the
bibliomaniac
i
wish
i
had
had
when
i
was
collecting
rare
editions
collecting
rare
books
and
a
good
business
sense
seldom
go
together
i
fancy
said
the
idiot
i
began
collecting
books
once
but
i
gave
it
up
and
took
to
collecting
coins
i
chose
my
coin
and
devoted
my
time
to
getting
in
that
variety
alone
and
it
has
paid
me
i
do
exactly
gather
your
meaning
said
whitechoker
you
chose
your
coin
precisely
i
said
most
coin
collectors
spend
their
time
looking
for
one
or
two
rare
coins
for
which
when
they
are
found
they
pay
fabulous
prices
the
result
is
oftentimes
penury
i
on
the
other
hand
will
look
for
coins
of
a
common
sort
which
do
not
command
fabulous
prices
so
i
chose
united
states
gold
pieces
irrespective
of
dates
for
my
collection
and
the
result
is
moderate
affluence
i
have
between
sixty
and
a
hundred
of
them
at
my
and
when
i
have
found
it
necessary
to
realize
on
them
i
have
not
experienced
the
slightest
difficulty
in
forcing
them
back
into
circulation
at
cost
you
are
a
wise
idiot
said
the
bibliomaniac
settling
back
in
his
chair
in
a
disgusted
tired
sort
of
way
he
had
expected
some
sympathy
from
the
idiot
as
a
even
though
their
aims
were
different
it
is
always
difficult
for
a
man
whose
library
has
brought
six
hundred
dollars
in
the
to
find
even
in
the
ranks
of
collectors
one
who
understands
his
woes
and
helps
him
bear
the
burden
thereof
by
expressions
of
confidence
in
his
sanity
then
you
believe
in
travel
do
you
asked
the
doctor
i
believe
there
is
nothing
broadens
the
mind
so
much
returned
the
idiot
but
do
you
believe
it
will
develop
a
mind
where
there
is
one
asked
the
unpleasantly
or
to
put
it
more
favorably
you
think
there
would
be
danger
in
taking
the
germ
of
a
mind
in
a
small
head
and
broadening
it
until
it
runs
the
risk
of
finding
itself
confined
to
cramped
quarters
that
is
a
question
for
a
physician
to
answer
said
the
idiot
but
if
i
were
you
i
would
travel
if
i
thought
there
was
any
such
danger
retorted
the
is
true
repartee
i
shall
have
to
take
your
word
for
that
returned
the
idiot
since
i
have
not
a
latin
dictionary
with
me
and
all
the
latin
i
know
is
to
be
found
in
the
quotations
in
the
back
of
my
dictionary
like
quo
vino
and
tu
however
as
i
said
before
i
like
to
travel
and
i
would
if
it
were
not
that
the
sea
and
i
are
not
on
very
good
terms
with
each
other
it
makes
me
ill
to
cross
the
east
river
on
the
bridge
i
so
susceptible
to
you
get
over
that
in
a
very
few
days
said
the
genial
old
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibed
i
have
crossed
the
ocean
a
dozen
times
and
i
never
after
the
third
day
out
ah
but
those
three
days
said
the
idiot
they
must
resemble
the
three
days
of
grace
on
a
note
that
you
know
you
could
pay
if
you
had
three
years
of
grace
i
could
stand
them
i
am
afraid
why
only
last
summer
i
took
a
drive
off
in
the
country
and
the
motion
of
the
wagon
going
over
the
in
the
road
made
me
so
before
i
gone
a
mile
that
i
wanted
to
lie
down
and
die
i
think
i
should
have
done
so
if
the
horse
had
run
away
and
forced
me
to
ride
back
home
whether
i
wanted
to
or
not
you
ought
to
fight
that
said
the
doctor
if
you
give
way
to
a
weakness
of
that
sort
the
creases
in
your
morning
newspaper
will
affect
you
similarly
as
you
read
it
if
you
ever
have
a
birthday
let
us
know
and
we
help
you
to
overcome
the
tendency
by
buying
you
a
for
you
to
swing
around
in
every
morning
until
you
get
used
to
the
motion
it
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
replied
the
idiot
if
you
as
a
physician
would
invent
a
preventive
of
i
buy
a
bottle
and
go
abroad
at
once
on
my
coin
collection
if
you
would
guarantee
it
to
kill
or
to
cure
instantaneously
there
is
such
a
nostrum
said
the
doctor
there
is
indeed
put
in
the
genial
old
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibes
i
tried
it
and
were
you
asked
the
doctor
i
never
knew
replied
the
genial
old
gentleman
it
made
me
so
ill
that
i
never
thought
to
inquire
what
was
the
matter
with
me
but
one
thing
is
certain
i
take
my
straight
after
this
i
like
to
go
by
rail
said
the
idiot
after
a
moment
thought
that
is
a
desire
quite
characteristic
of
you
said
the
it
is
so
probable
that
you
could
why
not
say
that
you
like
to
cross
the
atlantic
on
a
because
i
have
no
such
ambition
replied
the
idiot
though
it
might
be
fun
if
the
were
a
and
one
could
sit
comfortably
in
a
spacious
cab
while
speeding
over
the
water
i
should
think
that
would
be
exhilarating
enough
just
imagine
how
fine
it
would
be
on
a
stormy
day
to
sit
looking
out
of
your
far
above
the
surface
of
the
raging
and
impotent
sea
skipping
along
at
electric
speed
and
daring
the
waves
to
do
their
worst
that
would
be
bliss
and
so
practical
growled
the
bibliomaniac
bliss
rarely
is
practical
said
the
idiot
bliss
is
a
sort
of
mugwump
blessing
too
full
of
the
ideal
and
too
barren
in
practicability
well
said
whitechoker
i
do
know
why
we
should
say
that
between
new
york
and
london
never
can
be
if
we
had
told
our
grandfathers
a
hundred
years
ago
that
a
cable
for
the
transmission
of
news
could
be
laid
under
the
sea
they
would
have
laughed
us
to
scorn
that
true
said
the
but
we
know
more
than
our
grandfathers
did
well
rather
interrupted
the
idiot
my
who
died
in
had
never
even
heard
of
andrew
jackson
and
if
you
had
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
darwin
he
have
thought
you
were
guying
him
respect
for
age
sir
retorted
pedagog
restrains
me
from
characterizing
your
if
as
you
intimate
he
knew
less
than
you
do
however
apart
from
the
comparative
lack
of
knowledge
in
the
idiot
family
whitechoker
you
must
remember
that
with
the
advance
of
the
centuries
we
have
ourselves
developed
a
certain
amount
of
brains
enough
at
least
to
understand
that
there
is
a
limit
even
to
the
possibilities
of
electricity
now
when
you
say
that
just
because
an
atlantic
cable
would
have
been
regarded
as
an
object
of
derision
in
the
eighteenth
century
we
should
not
deride
one
who
suggests
the
possibility
of
a
marine
between
london
and
new
york
in
the
twentieth
century
it
appears
to
me
that
you
are
talking
er
talking
i
do
like
to
say
nonsense
to
one
of
your
cloth
but
through
his
hat
is
the
idiom
you
are
trying
to
recall
i
think
pedagog
said
the
idiot
whitechoker
is
talking
through
his
hat
is
what
you
mean
to
say
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
idiot
said
the
but
when
i
find
that
i
need
your
assistance
in
framing
my
conversation
i
shall
er
i
shall
give
up
talking
i
mean
to
say
that
i
do
not
think
whitechoker
can
justify
his
conclusions
and
talks
without
having
given
the
subject
concerning
which
he
has
spoken
due
reflection
the
cable
runs
along
the
solid
foundation
of
the
bed
of
the
sea
it
is
a
simple
matter
comparatively
but
a
stretched
across
the
ocean
by
the
simplest
rules
of
gravitation
could
not
be
made
to
stay
up
no
doubt
you
are
correct
said
whitechoker
meekly
i
did
not
mean
that
i
expected
ever
to
see
a
across
the
sea
but
i
did
mean
to
say
that
man
has
made
such
wonderful
advances
in
the
past
hundred
years
that
we
can
not
really
state
the
limit
of
his
possibilities
it
is
manifest
that
no
one
can
devise
a
plan
by
means
of
which
such
a
wire
could
be
carried
but
i
fear
you
gentlemen
would
starve
as
inventors
said
the
idiot
what
the
matter
with
balloons
balloons
for
what
retorted
pedagog
for
holding
up
the
replied
the
idiot
it
is
perfectly
feasible
fasten
the
ends
of
your
wire
in
london
and
new
york
and
from
coast
to
coast
station
two
lines
of
sufficient
strength
to
keep
the
wire
raised
as
far
above
the
level
of
the
sea
as
you
require
that
simple
enough
and
what
pray
in
this
frenzy
of
the
elements
this
raging
storm
of
which
you
have
spoken
said
pedagog
impatiently
what
would
then
keep
your
balloons
from
blowing
away
the
of
course
said
the
idiot
pedagog
lapsed
into
a
hopelessly
wrathful
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
he
said
well
i
sincerely
hope
your
plan
is
adopted
and
that
the
promoters
will
make
you
superintendent
with
an
office
in
the
balloon
thanks
for
your
good
wishes
pedagog
the
idiot
answered
if
they
are
realized
i
shall
remember
them
and
show
my
gratitude
to
you
by
using
my
influence
to
have
you
put
in
charge
of
the
gas
service
meantime
however
it
seems
to
me
that
our
ocean
steamships
could
be
developed
along
logical
lines
so
that
the
trip
from
new
york
to
liverpool
could
be
made
in
a
very
much
shorter
period
of
time
than
is
now
required
we
are
getting
back
to
the
again
said
the
bibliomaniac
that
is
a
proposition
to
which
i
agree
ten
years
ago
eight
days
was
considered
a
good
trip
with
the
development
of
the
steamer
the
time
has
been
reduced
to
approximately
six
days
or
a
saving
really
of
two
days
because
of
the
extra
screw
said
the
idiot
precisely
observed
the
bibliomaniac
so
that
provided
there
are
extra
screws
enough
there
is
any
reason
why
the
trip
should
not
be
made
in
two
or
three
hours
ah
what
was
that
said
the
bibliomaniac
i
do
exactly
follow
you
one
extra
screw
you
say
has
saved
two
days
yes
then
two
extra
screws
would
save
four
days
three
would
save
six
days
and
five
extra
screws
would
send
the
boat
over
in
approximately
no
time
said
the
idiot
so
if
it
takes
a
man
two
hours
to
succumb
to
a
boat
going
over
in
less
than
that
time
would
eliminate
more
people
would
go
boats
could
run
every
hour
and
whitechoker
could
have
a
european
trip
every
week
without
deserting
his
congregation
inestimable
boon
cried
whitechoker
with
a
laugh
would
it
be
said
the
idiot
unless
i
change
my
mind
i
think
i
shall
stay
in
this
country
until
this
style
of
greyhound
is
perfected
then
gentlemen
i
shall
tear
myself
away
from
you
and
seek
knowledge
in
foreign
pastures
well
i
am
sure
said
pedagog
i
am
sure
that
we
all
hope
you
will
change
your
mind
then
you
want
me
to
go
abroad
said
the
idiot
no
said
pedagog
no
not
so
much
that
as
that
we
feel
if
you
were
to
change
your
mind
the
change
could
not
fail
to
be
for
the
better
a
mind
like
yours
ought
to
be
changed
well
i
do
know
said
the
idiot
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
i
broke
it
up
into
smaller
denominations
but
i
had
it
so
long
that
i
have
become
attached
to
it
but
there
is
one
thing
about
it
there
is
plenty
of
it
so
that
in
case
any
of
you
gentlemen
find
your
own
insufficient
i
shall
be
only
too
happy
to
give
you
a
piece
of
it
without
charge
meanwhile
if
pedagog
will
kindly
let
me
have
my
bill
for
last
week
i
be
obliged
it
wo
be
ready
until
mr
idiot
said
the
landlady
in
surprise
i
sorry
said
the
idiot
rising
my
has
run
out
i
wanted
to
put
in
this
morning
writing
a
poem
on
the
back
of
it
a
poem
what
about
said
pedagog
with
an
irritating
chuckle
it
was
to
be
a
triolet
on
omniscience
said
the
idiot
and
strange
to
say
sir
you
were
to
be
the
hero
if
by
any
possibility
i
could
squeeze
you
into
a
french
form
iv
the
incorporation
of
the
idiot
how
is
business
these
days
mr
idiot
asked
the
poet
as
the
one
addressed
laid
down
the
morning
paper
with
a
careworn
expression
on
his
face
good
i
hope
fair
only
replied
the
idiot
my
honored
employer
was
quite
blue
about
things
yesterday
and
if
i
had
staved
him
off
i
think
he
have
proposed
swapping
places
with
me
he
has
said
quite
often
of
late
that
i
had
the
best
of
it
because
all
i
had
to
earn
was
my
salary
whereas
he
had
to
earn
my
salary
and
his
own
living
besides
i
offered
to
give
him
ten
per
cent
of
my
salary
for
ten
per
cent
of
his
living
but
he
said
he
guessed
he
would
adding
that
i
seemed
to
be
as
great
an
idiot
as
ever
i
fancy
he
was
right
there
said
pedagog
i
should
really
like
to
know
how
a
man
of
your
peculiar
mental
construction
can
be
of
the
slightest
practical
value
to
a
banker
i
ask
the
question
in
all
kindness
too
meaning
to
cast
no
reflections
whatever
upon
either
you
or
your
employer
you
are
a
roaring
success
in
your
own
line
which
is
all
any
one
could
ask
of
you
there
hominy
for
you
as
the
darky
said
to
the
hotel
guest
returned
the
idiot
any
person
who
says
that
discord
exists
at
this
table
does
know
what
he
is
talking
about
even
the
oil
and
the
vinegar
mix
in
the
caster
that
is
i
judge
they
do
from
the
oleaginous
appearance
of
the
vinegar
but
i
am
very
useful
to
my
employer
pedagog
he
says
frequently
that
he
would
know
what
not
to
do
if
it
were
not
for
me
are
you
losing
control
of
your
tongue
queried
the
bibliomaniac
looking
at
the
idiot
in
wonderment
do
you
mean
that
he
says
he
would
know
what
to
do
if
it
were
not
for
you
no
i
do
said
the
idiot
i
never
lose
control
of
my
tongue
i
meant
exactly
what
i
said
barlow
told
me
in
so
many
words
that
if
it
were
not
for
me
he
would
know
what
to
do
he
calls
me
his
back
action
patent
reversible
counsellor
if
he
is
puzzled
over
an
intricate
point
he
sends
for
me
and
says
and
such
a
thing
being
the
case
mr
idiot
what
would
you
do
do
think
about
it
but
tell
me
on
impulse
your
thoughtless
opinions
are
worth
more
to
me
than
i
can
tell
you
so
i
tell
him
on
impulse
just
what
i
should
do
whereupon
he
does
the
other
thing
and
comes
out
ahead
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
and
you
confess
it
eh
said
the
doctor
with
a
curve
on
his
lip
i
certainly
do
said
the
idiot
the
world
must
take
me
for
what
i
am
i
not
going
to
be
one
thing
for
myself
and
build
up
a
fictitious
idiot
for
the
world
the
world
calls
you
men
of
pretence
conceited
whereas
by
pretending
to
be
something
that
you
are
not
you
give
to
the
world
what
i
should
call
convincing
evidence
that
you
are
not
at
all
conceited
but
rather
somewhat
ashamed
of
what
you
know
yourselves
to
be
now
i
rather
believe
in
conceit
real
honest
pride
in
yourself
as
you
know
yourself
to
be
i
am
an
idiot
and
it
is
my
ambition
to
be
a
perfect
idiot
if
i
had
been
born
a
jackass
i
should
have
endeavored
to
be
a
perfect
jackass
you
have
found
it
easy
said
pedagog
dryly
would
i
said
the
idiot
i
have
to
take
your
word
for
it
sir
for
have
never
been
a
jackass
and
so
can
not
form
an
opinion
on
the
subject
pride
goeth
before
a
fall
said
whitechoker
seeing
a
chance
to
work
in
a
moral
reflection
exactly
said
the
idiot
wherefore
i
admire
pride
it
is
a
that
enables
man
to
avoid
the
fall
if
adam
had
had
any
pride
he
never
have
fallen
but
speaking
about
my
controlling
my
tongue
it
is
not
entirely
out
of
the
range
of
possibilities
that
i
shall
lose
control
of
myself
i
expected
that
sooner
or
later
said
the
doctor
is
it
to
be
bloomingdale
or
a
private
you
are
going
to
neither
replied
the
idiot
calmly
i
shall
stay
here
for
as
the
poet
says
best
to
bear
the
ills
we
hov
nor
fly
to
those
we
know
not
of
ho
jeered
the
poet
i
must
confess
my
dear
idiot
that
i
do
not
think
you
are
a
success
in
quotation
hamlet
spoke
those
lines
differently
shakespeare
hamlet
did
my
little
personal
shakespeare
makes
his
hamlet
an
entirely
different
less
stilted
sort
of
person
said
the
idiot
you
have
a
personal
shakespeare
have
you
queried
the
bibliomaniac
of
course
i
have
the
idiot
answered
have
you
i
have
not
said
the
bibliomaniac
shortly
well
i
sorry
for
you
then
sighed
the
idiot
putting
a
fried
potato
in
his
mouth
very
sorry
i
would
give
a
cent
for
another
ideals
i
want
my
own
ideals
and
i
have
my
own
ideal
of
shakespeare
in
fancy
shakespeare
and
i
have
roamed
over
the
fields
of
warwickshire
together
and
i
had
more
fun
imagining
the
kind
of
things
he
and
i
would
have
said
to
each
other
than
i
ever
got
out
of
his
published
plays
few
of
which
have
escaped
the
ungentle
hands
of
the
devastators
you
mean
commentators
i
imagine
said
pedagog
i
do
said
the
idiot
it
all
the
same
whether
you
call
them
commentors
or
devastators
the
result
is
the
same
new
editions
of
shakespeare
are
issued
every
year
and
people
buy
them
to
see
not
what
shakespeare
has
written
but
what
new
quip
some
opinionated
devastator
has
tried
to
fasten
on
his
memory
in
a
hundred
years
from
now
the
works
of
shakespeare
will
differ
as
much
from
what
they
are
as
versions
differ
from
what
they
were
when
shakespeare
wrote
them
mighty
discouraging
to
one
like
myself
who
would
like
to
write
works
you
are
convicted
out
of
your
own
mouth
said
the
bibliomaniac
a
moment
since
you
wasted
your
pity
on
me
because
i
did
mutilate
shakespeare
so
as
to
make
him
my
own
and
now
you
attack
the
commentators
for
doing
precisely
the
same
thing
they
as
much
entitled
to
their
opinions
as
you
are
to
yours
did
you
ever
learn
to
draw
parallels
when
you
were
in
school
asked
the
idiot
i
did
and
i
think
i
made
a
perfect
parallel
in
this
case
you
attack
people
in
one
breath
for
what
you
commiserate
me
for
not
doing
in
another
said
the
bibliomaniac
not
exactly
said
the
idiot
i
do
object
to
the
commentators
for
commentating
but
i
do
object
to
their
putting
out
their
versions
of
shakespeare
as
shakespeare
i
might
as
well
have
my
edition
published
it
certainly
would
be
popular
especially
where
in
cæsar
i
introduce
five
cassiuses
and
have
them
all
fall
on
their
swords
together
with
military
precision
like
a
sextette
for
instance
well
i
hope
you
never
print
such
an
atrocity
as
that
cried
the
bibliomaniac
hotly
if
there
one
thing
in
literature
without
excuse
and
utterly
contemptible
it
is
the
comic
version
the
parody
of
a
masterpiece
you
need
have
no
fear
on
that
score
returned
the
idiot
i
time
to
rewrite
shakespeare
and
since
i
try
never
to
stop
short
of
absolute
completeness
i
shall
not
embark
on
the
enterprise
if
i
do
however
i
shall
not
do
as
the
commentators
do
and
put
on
my
edited
by
willie
wilkins
but
as
he
might
have
been
had
his
plays
been
written
by
an
idiot
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
could
do
great
work
with
observed
the
poet
i
think
so
myself
said
the
idiot
but
i
shall
never
write
i
do
want
to
have
my
fair
fame
exposed
to
the
merciless
hands
of
the
devastators
i
shall
never
cease
to
regret
said
pedagog
after
a
thought
that
you
are
so
timid
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
works
of
the
idiot
i
admit
that
my
desire
is
more
or
less
a
morbid
one
it
is
quite
on
a
plane
with
the
feeling
that
prompts
me
to
wish
to
see
that
unfortunate
man
on
the
bowery
who
exhibits
his
forehead
which
is
sixteen
inches
high
beginning
with
his
eyebrows
for
a
dime
the
strange
the
bizarre
in
nature
has
always
interested
me
the
more
unnatural
the
nature
the
more
i
gloat
upon
it
from
that
point
of
view
i
do
most
earnestly
hope
that
when
you
are
inspired
with
a
work
you
will
let
me
at
least
see
it
very
well
answered
the
idiot
i
shall
put
your
name
down
as
a
subscriber
to
the
monthly
which
some
of
my
friends
contemplate
publishing
that
is
what
i
mean
when
i
say
i
may
shortly
lose
control
of
myself
these
friends
of
mine
profess
to
have
been
so
impressed
by
my
dicta
that
they
have
asked
me
if
i
would
allow
myself
to
be
incorporated
into
a
stock
company
the
object
of
which
should
be
to
transform
my
personality
into
printed
pages
hardly
a
day
goes
by
but
i
devote
a
portion
of
my
time
to
a
poem
in
which
the
thought
is
conspicuous
either
by
its
absence
or
its
presence
my
schemes
for
the
amelioration
of
the
condition
of
the
civilized
are
notorious
among
those
who
know
me
my
views
on
current
topics
are
eagerly
sought
for
my
business
instinct
as
i
have
already
told
you
is
invaluable
to
my
employer
and
my
fiction
is
unsurpassed
in
its
fictitiousness
what
more
is
needed
for
a
magazine
you
have
the
poetry
the
philanthropy
the
man
of
the
fictitiousness
and
the
business
instinct
necessary
for
the
successful
modern
magazine
all
concentrated
in
one
person
why
not
publish
that
person
say
my
friends
and
i
feeling
as
i
do
that
no
man
has
a
right
to
the
selfish
enjoyment
of
the
great
gifts
nature
has
bestowed
upon
him
of
course
can
only
agree
i
am
to
be
incorporated
with
a
capital
stock
of
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
myself
i
am
to
be
permitted
to
retain
the
rest
my
friends
will
subscribe
for
at
fifty
cents
on
the
dollar
if
any
of
you
want
shares
in
the
enterprise
i
have
no
doubt
you
can
be
accommodated
i
obliged
to
you
for
the
opportunity
said
the
doctor
but
i
have
to
be
very
careful
about
things
i
take
stock
in
and
in
general
i
regard
you
as
a
thing
in
which
i
should
prefer
not
to
take
stock
and
i
observed
pedagog
i
have
never
up
to
this
time
taken
any
stock
in
you
and
i
make
it
a
rule
to
be
guided
in
life
by
precedent
therefore
i
must
be
counted
out
i
wait
until
you
are
listed
at
the
stock
exchange
put
in
the
bibliomaniac
while
thanking
you
just
the
same
for
the
chance
you
can
put
me
down
for
one
share
to
be
paid
for
in
poetry
said
the
poet
with
a
wink
at
the
idiot
you
never
make
good
said
the
idiot
slyly
and
i
said
the
genial
old
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibes
shall
be
most
happy
to
take
five
shares
to
be
paid
for
in
advice
and
moreover
if
your
company
needs
to
establish
its
enterprise
you
may
count
upon
me
for
unlimited
credit
oh
as
for
that
said
the
idiot
i
have
plenty
of
even
pedagog
supplies
me
with
more
of
it
than
i
deserve
though
by
no
means
with
all
that
i
desire
that
is
yours
as
an
individual
mr
idiot
returned
the
as
a
corporation
however
i
can
not
permit
you
to
trade
upon
me
even
for
that
your
value
is
in
my
eyes
entirely
too
fluctuating
and
it
is
in
the
fluctuating
stock
that
the
great
fortunes
are
made
pedagog
said
the
idiot
as
an
individual
i
appreciate
your
as
a
corporation
i
am
soulless
without
emotions
and
so
cherish
no
disappointments
over
your
refusal
i
think
if
the
scheme
goes
through
it
will
be
successful
and
i
fully
expect
to
see
the
day
when
idiot
preferred
will
be
selling
as
high
if
not
higher
than
steel
and
leaving
utterly
behind
any
other
industrial
that
ever
was
known
copper
or
rope
if
like
the
railways
you
could
issue
betterment
bonds
you
might
do
very
well
said
the
doctor
i
think
ten
million
dollars
spent
in
bettering
you
might
bring
you
up
to
par
or
a
consolidated
bond
remarked
the
bibliomaniac
consolidate
the
idiot
with
a
man
like
chamberlain
or
the
german
emperor
and
issue
a
mortgage
on
the
result
and
you
might
find
people
who
take
those
bonds
at
you
might
if
they
were
a
dollar
bond
printed
on
said
pedagog
then
purchasers
could
paper
their
walls
with
them
rail
on
said
the
idiot
i
can
stand
it
when
i
begin
paying
quarterly
dividends
at
a
rate
you
wish
you
had
come
in
i
do
know
about
that
said
pedagog
it
would
entirely
depend
on
what
queried
the
idiot
unwarily
on
whether
that
ten
per
cent
was
declared
upon
your
own
estimate
of
your
value
or
upon
ours
on
yours
it
would
be
fabulous
on
ours
oh
well
what
is
the
use
of
saying
anything
more
about
it
we
are
not
going
in
it
and
that
an
end
to
it
well
i
go
in
it
if
you
change
your
scheme
said
the
doctor
if
instead
of
an
idiot
publishing
company
you
will
try
to
float
yourself
as
a
consolidated
gas
company
you
may
count
on
me
to
take
a
controlling
interest
i
will
submit
the
proposition
to
my
friends
said
the
idiot
calmly
it
would
be
something
to
turn
out
an
honest
gas
company
which
i
should
of
course
try
to
be
but
i
am
afraid
the
public
will
not
accept
it
there
is
little
demand
for
and
besides
they
would
fear
to
intrust
you
with
a
controlling
interest
for
fear
that
you
might
blow
the
product
out
and
the
bills
up
coining
millions
by
mere
inflation
they
heard
of
you
doctor
and
they
know
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
be
likely
to
do
v
university
extension
i
was
surprised
and
gratified
last
evening
mr
idiot
observed
the
as
breakfast
was
served
to
see
you
at
the
university
extension
lecture
i
did
not
know
that
you
admitted
the
necessity
of
further
instruction
in
any
matter
pertaining
to
human
knowledge
i
do
know
that
i
do
admit
the
necessity
returned
the
idiot
sometimes
when
i
take
an
inventory
of
the
contents
of
my
mind
it
seems
to
me
that
about
everything
i
need
is
there
there
you
go
again
said
the
bibliomaniac
why
do
you
persist
in
your
refusal
to
allow
any
one
to
get
a
favorable
impression
concerning
you
pedagog
unbends
sufficiently
to
tell
you
that
you
have
at
last
done
something
which
he
can
commend
and
you
greet
him
with
an
idiotism
which
is
practically
a
rebuff
very
well
said
observed
the
with
an
acquiescent
nod
i
came
to
this
table
this
morning
encouraged
to
believe
that
this
young
man
was
beginning
to
see
the
error
of
his
ways
and
i
must
confess
to
a
great
enough
interest
in
him
to
say
that
i
was
pleased
at
that
encouragement
i
saw
him
at
a
lecture
on
literature
at
the
lyceum
hall
last
evening
and
he
appeared
to
be
interested
and
yet
this
morning
he
seems
to
show
that
he
is
utterly
incorrigible
may
i
ask
sir
why
you
attended
that
lecture
if
as
you
say
your
mind
is
already
sufficiently
well
furnished
certainly
you
may
ask
that
question
replied
the
idiot
i
went
to
that
lecture
to
have
my
impressions
confirmed
that
is
all
i
have
certain
notions
concerning
university
extension
and
i
wished
to
see
if
they
were
correct
i
found
that
they
were
the
lecture
was
not
upon
university
extension
but
upon
romanticism
and
it
was
a
most
able
discourse
retorted
pedagog
very
likely
said
the
idiot
i
did
not
hear
it
i
did
not
want
to
hear
it
i
have
my
own
ideas
concerning
romanticism
which
do
not
need
confirmation
or
correction
i
have
already
confirmed
and
corrected
them
i
went
to
see
the
audience
and
not
to
hear
professor
peterkin
exploding
theories
it
is
a
pity
the
chair
you
occupied
was
wasted
upon
you
snapped
pedagog
i
agree
with
you
said
the
idiot
i
could
have
got
a
much
better
view
of
the
audience
if
i
had
been
permitted
to
sit
on
the
stage
but
professor
peterkin
needed
all
that
for
his
gestures
however
i
saw
enough
from
where
i
sat
to
confirm
my
impression
that
university
extension
is
not
so
much
of
a
public
benefit
as
a
social
fad
there
was
hardly
a
soul
in
the
audience
who
could
not
have
got
all
that
professor
peterkin
had
to
tell
him
out
of
his
books
there
was
hardly
a
soul
in
the
audience
who
could
not
have
afforded
to
pay
one
dollar
at
least
for
the
seat
he
occupied
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
audience
who
had
paid
more
than
ten
cents
for
his
seat
or
her
seat
and
those
for
whose
benefit
the
lecture
was
presumably
given
the
people
were
crowded
out
the
lectures
themselves
are
not
instructive
professor
peterkin
particularly
except
in
so
far
as
it
is
instructive
to
hear
what
professor
peterkin
thinks
on
this
or
that
subject
and
his
desire
to
be
original
forces
him
to
cook
up
views
which
no
one
else
ever
held
with
the
result
that
what
he
says
is
most
interesting
and
proper
to
be
presented
to
the
attention
of
a
discriminating
audience
but
not
proper
to
be
presented
to
an
audience
that
is
supposed
to
come
there
to
receive
instruction
you
have
just
said
that
you
did
not
listen
to
the
lecture
how
do
you
know
that
what
you
say
is
true
put
in
the
bibliomaniac
i
know
professor
peterkin
said
the
idiot
does
he
know
you
sneered
pedagog
i
do
think
he
would
remember
me
if
you
should
speak
my
name
in
his
presence
observed
the
idiot
calmly
but
that
is
easily
accounted
for
the
professor
never
remembers
anybody
but
himself
well
i
admit
said
pedagog
that
the
professor
lectures
were
rather
advanced
for
the
comprehension
of
a
person
like
the
idiot
nevertheless
it
was
an
enjoyable
occasion
and
i
doubt
if
the
fulminations
of
our
friend
here
will
avail
against
university
extension
you
speak
a
sad
truth
said
the
idiot
social
fads
are
impervious
to
fulmination
as
solomon
might
have
said
had
he
thought
of
it
as
long
as
a
thing
is
a
social
fad
it
will
thrive
and
on
the
whole
perhaps
it
ought
to
thrive
anything
which
gives
society
something
to
think
about
has
its
value
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
makes
society
is
proof
of
that
value
we
seem
to
be
in
a
philosophic
frame
of
mind
this
morning
said
whitechoker
we
are
returned
the
idiot
that
one
thing
about
university
extension
it
makes
us
philosophic
it
has
made
a
stoic
of
my
dear
old
daddy
oh
yes
cried
pedagog
you
a
father
have
you
i
had
forgotten
that
wherein
said
the
idiot
we
differ
have
forgotten
that
i
have
one
and
it
is
from
him
that
i
first
heard
of
university
extension
he
lives
in
a
small
manufacturing
town
not
many
miles
from
here
and
is
distinguished
in
the
town
because
without
being
stingy
he
lives
within
his
means
he
has
a
way
of
paying
his
grocer
bills
which
makes
of
him
a
marked
man
he
has
much
more
money
than
he
needs
but
when
the
university
extension
movement
reached
the
town
he
was
interested
the
prime
movers
in
the
enterprise
went
to
him
and
asked
him
if
he
would
help
it
along
dilating
upon
the
benefits
which
would
accrue
to
those
whose
education
stopped
short
with
graduation
from
the
it
was
most
plausible
the
notion
that
for
ten
cents
a
lecture
the
working
masses
could
learn
something
about
art
history
and
letters
could
gather
in
something
about
the
sciences
and
all
that
appealed
to
him
and
while
he
could
afford
it
much
more
ill
than
the
smart
people
the
four
hundred
of
the
town
he
chipped
in
he
paid
fifty
dollars
and
was
made
an
honorary
manager
he
was
proud
enough
of
it
too
and
he
wrote
a
long
enthusiastic
letter
to
me
about
it
it
was
a
great
thing
and
he
hoped
the
state
which
had
been
appealed
to
to
help
the
movement
along
would
take
a
hand
in
it
we
educate
the
masses
to
understand
and
to
appreciate
the
artistic
the
beautiful
he
wrote
need
have
little
fear
for
the
future
ignorance
is
the
greatest
foe
we
have
to
contend
against
in
our
national
development
and
it
is
the
only
thing
that
can
overthrow
a
nation
such
as
ours
is
and
then
what
happened
professor
peterkin
came
along
and
delivered
ten
or
a
dozen
lectures
the
masses
went
once
or
twice
and
found
the
platform
occupied
by
a
man
who
talked
to
them
about
romanticism
and
realism
who
told
them
that
dickens
was
trash
who
exalted
tolstoi
and
ibsen
but
who
never
let
them
into
the
secret
of
what
romanticism
was
and
who
kept
them
equally
in
the
dark
as
to
the
significance
of
realism
they
also
found
the
best
seats
in
the
occupied
by
the
smart
set
in
full
who
talked
almost
as
much
and
as
loudly
as
did
professor
peterkin
the
masses
did
not
even
learn
manners
at
professor
first
and
second
lectures
and
the
third
and
fourth
found
them
conspicuous
by
their
absence
all
they
learned
was
that
they
were
ignorant
and
that
other
people
were
better
than
they
and
what
my
father
learned
was
that
he
had
subscribed
fifty
dollars
to
promote
a
series
of
social
functions
for
the
diversion
of
the
four
hundred
and
the
aggrandizement
of
professor
peterkin
he
started
in
for
what
might
be
called
romanticism
and
he
got
a
realism
that
he
did
not
like
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
of
it
and
in
that
town
university
extension
is
such
a
fad
that
when
some
weeks
ago
the
swell
club
of
that
place
talked
of
appointing
thursday
evening
as
its
club
night
it
was
found
to
be
impossible
for
the
reason
that
it
might
interfere
with
the
attendance
upon
the
university
extension
lectures
that
pedagog
is
a
matter
of
history
and
can
be
proven
and
last
audience
confirmed
the
impression
which
i
had
formed
from
what
my
father
had
told
me
professor
peterkin
lectures
are
interesting
to
you
a
but
they
are
pure
greek
to
me
who
would
like
to
know
more
about
letters
i
would
gather
more
instruction
from
your
in
an
hour
than
i
could
from
professor
peterkin
whole
course
you
flatter
me
said
pedagog
no
returned
the
idiot
if
you
knew
how
little
the
ignorant
gain
from
peterkin
you
would
not
necessarily
call
it
flattery
if
one
should
say
he
learned
more
from
your
conversation
over
a
you
misconceive
the
whole
situation
i
think
nevertheless
said
whitechoker
as
i
understand
it
supplementary
lectures
and
examinations
based
on
them
are
held
after
the
lectures
when
the
practical
instruction
is
given
with
great
thoroughness
i
glad
you
spoke
of
that
said
the
idiot
i
had
forgotten
that
part
of
it
professor
peterkin
received
pay
for
his
lectures
which
dealt
in
theories
only
plain
barton
who
delivered
the
supplementary
lectures
got
nothing
professor
peterkin
taught
nothing
but
he
represented
university
extension
plain
barton
did
the
work
and
represented
nothing
both
reached
society
neither
reached
the
masses
in
my
native
town
plain
barton
supplementary
lectures
which
were
simply
an
effort
to
unravel
the
peterkin
complications
were
attended
by
the
same
people
in
smaller
crowds
people
of
social
standing
who
were
curious
enough
to
devote
an
hour
a
week
to
an
endeavor
to
find
out
the
meaning
of
what
professor
peterkin
had
told
them
at
the
function
the
week
before
the
students
examined
were
mostly
ladies
and
i
happen
to
know
that
in
a
large
proportion
they
were
ladies
whose
husbands
could
have
afforded
to
pay
professor
peterkin
his
salary
ten
times
over
as
a
private
tutor
as
i
look
at
it
said
pedagog
gravely
it
does
not
make
much
difference
to
whom
your
instruction
is
given
so
long
as
it
instructs
what
if
these
lectures
do
interest
those
who
are
comparatively
well
off
your
society
woman
may
be
as
much
in
need
of
an
extended
education
as
your
factory
girl
the
university
extension
idea
is
to
convey
knowledge
to
people
who
would
not
otherwise
get
it
it
simply
sets
out
to
improve
minds
if
the
social
mind
needs
improvement
why
not
improve
it
why
condemn
a
system
because
it
does
not
discriminate
in
the
minds
selected
for
improvement
i
do
condemn
a
system
which
sets
out
to
improve
minds
irrespective
of
conditions
replied
the
idiot
but
i
should
most
assuredly
condemn
a
man
or
a
set
of
men
who
induced
me
to
subscribe
to
a
bread
fund
for
the
poor
and
who
afterwards
expended
that
money
on
for
the
czar
of
russia
the
fact
that
the
czar
of
russia
wanted
the
and
was
willing
to
accept
them
would
not
affect
my
feelings
in
the
matter
though
i
have
no
doubt
the
people
in
charge
of
the
fund
would
find
themselves
far
more
conspicuous
for
having
departed
from
the
original
idea
some
of
them
might
be
knighted
for
it
if
the
czar
happened
to
be
passionately
fond
of
then
having
attacked
this
system
what
would
you
have
would
you
have
university
extension
stop
asked
the
bibliomaniac
not
at
all
returned
the
idiot
anything
which
can
educate
society
is
a
good
thing
but
i
should
change
the
name
of
it
from
university
extension
to
social
expansion
and
i
should
compel
those
whose
minds
were
broadened
by
it
to
pay
the
bills
but
as
yet
you
have
failed
to
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
persisted
the
bibliomaniac
the
masses
can
attend
these
lectures
if
they
wish
to
and
on
your
own
statement
they
do
you
do
seem
to
consider
that
point
or
if
you
do
you
do
meet
it
i
do
think
it
necessary
to
meet
it
said
the
idiot
though
i
will
say
that
if
you
were
one
of
the
masses
a
girl
say
with
one
dress
threadbare
poor
and
and
possessed
of
a
natural
bit
of
pride
you
would
find
little
pleasure
in
attending
a
lecture
your
previous
education
does
not
permit
of
your
comprehending
and
sitting
through
an
evening
with
a
lot
of
finely
dressed
smart
folk
with
their
backs
turned
towards
you
the
plebeians
have
pride
my
dear
bibliomaniac
and
they
are
decidedly
averse
to
mixing
with
the
swells
they
would
like
to
be
educated
but
they
do
care
to
be
snubbed
for
the
privilege
of
being
mystified
by
a
man
like
professor
peterkin
even
for
so
small
a
sum
as
ten
cents
an
evening
vi
social
expansion
we
were
talking
about
university
extension
the
other
day
pedagog
said
the
idiot
as
the
folded
up
the
newspaper
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
i
as
you
remember
suggested
that
it
might
better
be
called
social
expansion
did
you
said
pedagog
coldly
i
do
remember
much
about
it
i
rarely
make
a
note
of
anything
you
may
say
well
i
did
suggest
the
change
of
name
whether
your
memory
is
retentive
or
not
and
i
have
been
thinking
the
matter
over
a
good
deal
since
and
i
think
i
got
hold
of
an
idea
returned
the
idiot
in
that
case
said
the
bibliomaniac
we
would
better
lock
the
door
if
you
have
really
got
hold
of
an
idea
you
should
be
very
careful
not
to
let
it
get
away
from
you
no
danger
of
that
said
the
idiot
with
a
smile
i
have
it
securely
locked
up
here
tapping
his
forehead
it
must
be
lonesome
said
pedagog
and
rather
uncomfortable
if
it
is
a
real
idea
observed
the
doctor
an
idea
in
the
idiot
mind
must
feel
somewhat
as
a
tall
stout
irish
maid
feels
when
she
goes
to
her
bedroom
in
one
of
those
harlem
you
men
are
losing
a
great
opportunity
said
the
idiot
with
a
scornful
glance
at
the
three
professional
gentlemen
the
idea
of
your
following
the
professions
of
pedagogy
medicine
and
literature
when
the
three
of
you
combined
could
make
a
fortune
as
an
incarnate
comic
paper
i
do
see
why
you
do
make
a
combination
like
those
german
bands
that
play
on
the
street
corners
and
go
about
from
door
to
door
and
crack
your
jokes
just
as
they
crack
their
music
i
am
sure
take
particularly
in
front
of
it
would
be
hard
on
the
comic
papers
said
the
poet
who
was
getting
a
little
unpopular
with
his
because
of
his
tendency
recently
developed
to
take
the
idiot
part
in
the
discussions
they
might
be
so
successful
that
the
instead
of
taking
the
comic
papers
for
their
customers
to
read
would
employ
one
or
more
of
them
to
sit
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
crack
jokes
aloud
we
could
rival
the
comic
papers
though
said
the
doctor
wishing
to
save
his
dignity
by
taking
the
bull
by
the
horns
we
might
do
the
jokes
well
enough
but
the
comic
papers
are
chiefly
pictorial
you
be
pictorial
enough
said
the
idiot
was
it
you
pedagog
that
said
the
doctor
here
looked
like
one
of
physicians
or
as
if
he
had
stepped
out
of
dickens
pages
or
something
like
it
i
never
said
anything
of
the
sort
cried
the
wrathfully
and
you
know
i
did
who
was
it
said
that
asked
the
idiot
innocently
looking
about
the
table
it
could
have
been
whitechoker
and
i
know
it
was
the
poet
or
my
genial
friend
who
occasionally
imbibes
pedagog
denies
it
i
did
say
it
pedagog
would
say
it
that
leaves
only
two
of
us
the
bibliomaniac
and
the
doctor
himself
i
do
think
the
doctor
would
make
a
personal
remark
of
that
kind
and
well
there
is
but
one
conclusion
bibliomaniac
i
am
surprised
what
roared
the
bibliomaniac
glaring
at
the
idiot
do
you
mean
to
fasten
the
impertinence
on
me
far
from
it
returned
the
idiot
meekly
very
far
from
it
it
is
fate
sir
that
has
done
that
the
circumstantial
evidence
against
you
is
strong
but
then
mercifully
enough
circumstantial
evidence
is
not
permitted
to
hang
a
man
now
see
here
mr
idiot
said
the
bibliomaniac
firmly
and
impressively
i
want
you
to
distinctly
understand
that
i
am
not
going
to
have
you
put
words
into
my
mouth
that
i
never
uttered
i
pray
do
attack
me
said
the
idiot
i
have
made
any
charge
against
you
i
only
asked
who
could
have
said
that
the
doctor
looked
like
a
creation
of
cruikshank
i
could
have
said
it
because
i
think
it
pedagog
denies
it
in
fact
every
one
here
has
a
clear
case
of
innocence
excepting
yourself
and
i
do
believe
said
it
only
the
chain
of
circumstance
oh
hang
your
chain
of
circumstance
interrupted
the
bibliomaniac
it
is
hung
said
the
idiot
and
it
appears
to
make
you
very
uncomfortable
however
as
i
was
saying
i
think
i
have
got
hold
of
an
idea
involving
a
truly
philanthropic
and
by
no
means
selfish
scheme
of
social
expansion
heigho
sighed
pedagog
i
sometimes
think
that
if
i
had
not
the
honor
to
be
the
husband
of
our
landlady
i
move
away
from
here
your
views
sir
are
undermining
my
constitution
you
only
think
so
pedagog
replied
the
idiot
you
are
simply
going
through
a
process
of
intellectual
reconstruction
at
my
hands
you
feel
exactly
as
a
man
feels
who
has
been
shut
up
in
the
dark
for
years
and
suddenly
finds
himself
in
a
flood
of
sunlight
i
am
doing
with
you
as
an
individual
what
i
would
have
society
do
for
mankind
at
large
in
other
words
while
i
am
working
for
individual
expansion
upon
the
raw
material
i
find
here
i
would
have
society
buckle
down
to
the
enlargement
of
itself
by
the
improvement
of
those
outside
of
itself
if
you
swim
in
water
as
well
as
you
do
in
verbiage
said
the
bibliomaniac
you
must
be
able
to
go
three
or
four
strokes
without
sinking
oh
as
for
that
i
can
swim
like
a
duck
said
the
idiot
you
sink
me
i
fancied
not
observed
pedagog
with
a
smile
at
his
own
joke
you
are
so
light
i
wonder
indeed
that
you
do
rise
up
into
space
anyhow
what
a
delightful
condition
of
affairs
that
suggestion
opens
up
said
the
idiot
turning
to
the
poet
if
i
were
you
i
make
a
poem
on
that
something
like
this
for
instance
i
am
so
very
very
light
that
gravitation
curbs
not
me
i
rise
up
through
the
atmosphere
till
all
the
world
i
plainly
see
i
dance
about
among
the
clouds
an
airy
happy
human
kite
the
breezes
toss
me
here
and
there
to
my
exceeding
great
delight
and
when
i
would
return
to
sup
to
breakfast
or
perchance
to
dine
i
haul
myself
once
more
to
earth
by
tugging
on
a
piece
of
twine
pedagog
grinned
broadly
at
this
you
are
entirely
without
your
good
points
he
said
if
we
ever
accept
your
idea
we
have
to
rely
on
you
for
the
nonsense
poetry
thank
you
said
the
idiot
i
help
if
i
had
a
man
like
you
to
give
me
the
suggestions
i
could
make
a
fortune
out
of
poetry
the
only
trouble
is
i
have
to
quarrel
with
you
before
i
can
get
you
to
give
me
a
suggestion
and
i
despise
bickering
so
do
i
returned
pedagog
let
give
up
bickering
and
turn
our
attention
to
er
social
extension
is
it
yes
or
social
expansion
said
the
idiot
some
years
ago
the
world
was
startled
to
hear
that
in
the
city
of
new
york
there
were
not
more
than
four
hundred
people
who
were
entitled
to
social
position
and
as
i
understand
it
as
time
has
progressed
the
number
has
still
further
diminished
last
year
the
number
was
only
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
as
i
read
the
social
news
of
not
more
than
people
are
now
beyond
all
question
in
the
swim
at
dinners
balls
functions
of
all
sorts
you
read
the
names
of
these
same
over
and
over
again
as
having
been
present
apparently
no
others
attended
or
if
they
did
they
were
not
so
indisputably
entitled
to
be
present
that
their
names
could
be
printed
in
the
published
accounts
now
all
of
this
shows
that
society
is
dying
out
and
that
if
things
keep
on
as
they
are
now
going
it
will
not
be
many
years
before
we
shall
become
a
people
without
society
a
nation
of
plebeians
your
statement
so
far
is
lucid
and
logical
said
pedagog
who
did
not
admire
society
so
called
and
who
did
not
object
to
the
goring
of
an
ox
in
which
he
was
not
personally
interested
well
why
is
this
social
contraction
going
on
asked
the
idiot
clearly
because
social
expansion
is
not
an
accepted
fact
if
it
were
society
would
grow
why
does
it
not
grow
why
are
its
ranks
not
augmented
there
is
raw
material
enough
you
would
like
to
get
into
the
swim
so
would
i
but
we
do
know
how
we
read
books
of
etiquette
but
they
are
far
from
being
complete
i
think
i
make
no
mistake
when
i
say
they
are
utterly
valueless
they
tell
us
no
more
than
the
funny
journal
tells
us
when
it
says
eat
pease
with
a
spoon
never
eat
pie
with
a
knife
never
put
salt
on
a
prune
never
throw
crumbs
at
your
wife
they
tell
most
of
us
what
we
all
knew
before
they
tell
us
not
to
wear
our
hats
in
the
house
they
tell
us
all
the
obvious
things
but
the
subtleties
of
how
to
get
into
society
they
do
not
tell
us
the
comic
papers
give
us
some
idea
of
how
to
behave
in
society
we
know
from
reading
the
funny
papers
that
a
really
swell
young
man
always
leans
against
a
when
he
is
calling
that
the
swell
girl
sits
on
a
comfortable
divan
with
her
feet
on
a
rug
and
they
converse
in
epigram
sometimes
the
epigram
is
positively
rude
when
it
is
not
rude
it
is
so
dull
that
no
one
wonders
that
the
tiger
head
on
the
rug
represents
the
tiger
as
yawning
but
while
this
is
instructive
it
teaches
us
how
to
behave
on
special
occasions
only
you
or
i
might
call
upon
a
young
woman
who
did
not
sit
on
a
divan
who
had
no
rug
to
put
her
feet
on
and
whose
parlor
had
a
against
which
we
could
not
lean
comfortably
what
are
we
to
do
then
as
far
as
they
go
the
funny
papers
are
excellent
but
they
do
go
far
enough
they
give
us
attractive
pictures
of
fashionable
dinners
but
it
is
always
of
the
dinner
after
the
game
course
some
of
us
would
like
to
know
how
society
behaves
while
the
soup
is
being
served
we
know
that
after
the
game
course
society
girls
reach
across
the
table
and
clink
with
young
men
but
we
do
not
know
what
they
do
before
they
get
to
the
clink
stage
nowhere
is
this
information
given
etiquette
books
are
silent
on
the
subject
and
though
i
have
sought
everywhere
for
information
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
how
many
salted
almonds
one
may
consume
at
dinner
without
embarrassing
one
hostess
now
if
i
ca
find
out
the
million
ca
find
out
wherefore
instead
of
shutting
themselves
selfishly
up
and
by
so
doing
forcing
society
finally
into
dissolution
why
can
not
some
of
these
people
who
know
what
is
what
give
to
the
million
educate
them
in
last
summer
there
was
a
play
put
on
at
one
of
our
theatres
in
which
there
was
a
scene
at
a
at
one
side
was
a
coach
for
the
first
week
the
coach
was
an
utterly
valueless
accessory
because
the
people
on
it
were
the
ordinary
supers
in
the
employ
of
the
theatre
they
did
not
know
how
to
behave
on
a
coach
and
nobody
was
interested
the
management
were
suddenly
seized
with
a
bright
idea
they
invited
several
swell
young
men
who
knew
how
things
were
done
on
coaches
to
come
and
do
these
things
on
their
coach
the
young
men
came
and
imparted
a
realism
to
the
scene
that
made
that
coach
the
centre
of
attraction
people
who
went
to
that
play
departed
educated
in
coach
etiquette
now
there
lies
my
scheme
in
a
nutshell
if
these
the
old
guard
of
society
which
dines
but
never
surrenders
will
give
once
a
week
a
social
function
in
some
place
like
madison
square
garden
to
which
the
million
may
go
merely
as
spectators
not
as
participators
is
there
any
doubt
that
they
would
fail
to
be
instructed
the
garden
will
seat
eight
or
ten
thousand
people
suppose
for
an
instance
that
a
dozen
of
your
best
exponents
of
what
is
what
were
to
give
a
dinner
in
the
middle
of
the
arena
with
ten
thousand
people
looking
on
do
you
mean
to
say
that
of
all
that
vast
audience
no
one
would
learn
thereby
how
to
behave
at
a
dinner
it
is
a
great
scheme
said
the
doctor
it
is
said
the
idiot
and
i
venture
to
say
that
a
course
of
say
twelve
social
functions
given
in
that
way
would
prove
so
popular
that
the
garden
would
turn
away
every
night
twice
as
many
people
as
it
could
accommodate
it
would
be
instructive
no
doubt
said
the
bibliomaniac
but
how
would
it
expand
society
would
you
have
examinations
most
assuredly
said
the
idiot
at
the
end
of
the
season
i
should
have
a
rigid
examination
of
all
who
chose
to
apply
i
would
make
them
dine
in
the
presence
of
a
committee
of
expert
diners
i
would
have
them
pass
a
searching
examination
in
the
art
of
wearing
a
dress
suit
in
the
science
of
entering
a
in
the
art
of
behavior
at
afternoon
teas
and
all
the
men
who
applied
should
also
be
compelled
to
pass
a
physical
examination
as
an
assurance
that
they
were
equal
to
the
task
of
getting
an
ice
for
a
young
lady
at
a
ball
society
would
get
to
be
too
inclusive
and
would
cease
to
be
exclusive
suggested
whitechoker
i
think
not
said
the
idiot
i
should
not
give
a
man
or
a
woman
the
degree
of
unless
he
or
she
had
passed
an
examination
of
one
hundred
per
cent
queried
pedagog
yes
returned
the
idiot
bachelor
of
society
a
degree
which
once
earned
should
entitle
one
to
recognition
as
a
member
of
the
upper
ten
anywhere
in
christendom
it
is
superb
cried
pedagog
enthusiastically
yes
said
the
idiot
at
ten
cents
a
function
it
would
beat
university
extension
out
of
sight
and
further
it
would
preserve
society
if
we
lose
society
we
lose
caste
and
worse
than
all
our
funny
men
would
have
to
go
out
of
business
for
there
would
be
no
fads
or
willieboys
left
to
ridicule
vii
a
beggar
mr
idiot
said
the
poet
one
morning
as
the
waffles
were
served
you
are
an
inventive
genius
why
do
you
invent
an
easy
way
to
make
a
fortune
the
trouble
with
most
methods
of
making
money
is
that
they
involve
too
much
labor
i
have
thought
of
that
said
the
idiot
and
yet
the
great
fortunes
have
been
made
in
a
way
which
involved
very
little
labor
comparatively
speaking
you
for
instance
probably
work
harder
over
a
yard
of
poetry
that
brings
you
in
ten
dollars
than
any
of
our
great
railroad
magnates
have
over
a
mile
of
railroad
which
has
brought
them
in
a
million
which
simply
proves
that
it
is
ideas
that
count
rather
than
labor
said
the
poet
not
exactly
said
the
idiot
if
you
put
a
hundred
ideas
into
a
quatrain
you
will
get
less
money
for
it
than
you
would
for
a
epic
in
which
you
have
possibly
only
half
an
idea
it
is
idea
so
much
as
nerve
that
counts
the
man
who
builds
railroads
does
advance
any
particular
idea
but
he
shows
lots
of
nerve
and
it
is
nerve
that
makes
wealth
i
believe
that
if
you
literary
men
would
show
more
nerve
force
and
spare
the
public
the
infliction
of
what
you
call
your
ideas
you
would
make
more
money
how
would
you
show
nerve
in
writing
queried
the
bibliomaniac
if
i
knew
i
write
and
make
my
fortune
said
the
idiot
unfortunately
i
do
know
how
one
can
show
nerve
in
writing
unless
it
be
in
taking
hold
of
some
particularly
popular
idiosyncrasy
of
mankind
and
treating
it
so
contemptuously
that
every
one
would
want
to
mob
you
if
you
could
get
the
public
mad
enough
at
you
to
want
to
mob
you
they
read
everything
you
write
simply
to
nourish
their
wrath
and
you
soon
be
cutting
coupons
for
a
living
and
could
then
afford
to
take
up
more
ideas
can
afford
theories
for
my
own
part
one
reason
why
i
do
not
myself
take
up
literature
for
a
profession
is
that
i
have
neither
the
nerve
nor
the
coupons
i
probably
run
along
in
the
rut
like
a
majority
of
the
writers
of
and
would
have
the
grit
to
strike
out
in
a
new
line
of
my
own
men
say
and
perhaps
very
properly
this
is
the
thing
that
has
succeeded
in
the
past
i
do
this
something
else
that
appears
alluring
enough
in
the
abstract
has
never
been
done
and
for
that
reason
i
wo
do
it
there
have
been
clever
men
before
me
men
clever
enough
to
think
of
this
something
that
i
fondly
imagine
is
original
and
they
have
done
it
doubtless
they
refrained
from
doing
it
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
and
i
am
not
going
to
be
fool
enough
to
set
my
judgment
up
against
theirs
in
other
words
i
lack
the
nerve
to
go
ahead
and
write
as
i
feel
i
prefer
to
study
past
successes
with
the
result
that
i
am
moderately
successful
only
it
the
same
way
in
every
line
of
business
precedent
guides
in
all
things
but
where
occasionally
you
find
a
man
courageous
enough
to
cast
precedent
to
the
winds
one
of
two
things
happens
either
fortune
or
ruin
follows
hence
the
thing
to
do
if
you
want
to
make
a
fortune
is
to
eliminate
the
possibility
of
ruin
as
far
as
may
be
you
can
not
ruin
a
man
who
has
nothing
he
is
down
on
anyhow
so
for
a
receipt
for
fortune
i
should
say
start
a
pauper
show
your
nerve
and
make
a
pile
or
you
wo
make
a
pile
if
you
make
it
you
are
fortunate
if
you
fail
to
make
it
you
are
no
more
unfortunate
than
you
were
before
you
started
for
plausibility
mr
idiot
said
pedagog
you
are
to
me
a
perfect
wonder
i
do
not
think
that
any
one
can
deny
with
confidence
born
of
certainty
the
truth
of
your
premises
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
your
conclusions
are
based
properly
upon
those
premises
and
yet
your
conclusions
are
almost
invariably
utterly
absurd
if
not
absolutely
grotesque
here
is
a
man
who
says
to
make
a
fortune
become
a
beggar
precisely
said
the
idiot
there
is
nothing
like
having
a
clean
slate
to
work
on
if
you
are
not
a
beggar
you
have
something
and
having
something
promotes
caution
and
tends
to
destroy
nerve
as
a
beggar
you
have
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
so
you
can
plunge
you
can
swim
better
in
deep
water
than
in
the
shallow
well
said
the
doctor
enlighten
us
on
this
point
you
may
not
know
how
to
show
nerve
as
a
writer
in
fact
you
confess
that
you
do
how
would
you
show
nerve
as
a
beggar
would
you
strive
to
enforce
your
demands
and
degenerate
into
a
common
highwayman
or
would
you
simply
go
in
for
big
profits
and
ask
for
ten
dollars
instead
of
ten
cents
he
probably
take
a
bag
of
dynamite
into
a
millionaire
office
and
threaten
to
blow
him
to
pieces
if
he
did
give
him
a
house
and
lot
sneered
the
bibliomaniac
not
at
all
said
the
idiot
that
cowardice
not
nerve
if
i
went
into
a
millionaire
office
and
demanded
a
million
or
a
house
and
lot
even
armed
with
a
bag
full
of
newspapers
pretending
it
held
dynamite
it
might
be
more
like
nerve
but
my
beggar
would
do
nothing
contrary
to
the
law
he
simply
be
nervy
that
all
cheeky
perhaps
you
call
it
for
instance
i
believe
that
if
i
were
to
hire
in
the
elevated
cars
one
of
those
advertising
spaces
above
the
windows
and
were
to
place
in
that
space
a
placard
saying
that
i
was
by
nature
too
lazy
to
work
too
fond
of
life
to
starve
too
poor
to
live
and
too
honest
to
steal
and
would
be
placed
in
affluence
if
every
man
and
woman
who
saw
that
sign
would
send
me
ten
cents
a
week
in
for
five
weeks
running
i
should
receive
enough
money
to
enable
me
to
live
at
the
most
expensive
hotel
in
town
during
that
period
by
living
at
that
hotel
and
paying
my
bills
regularly
i
could
get
credit
enough
to
set
myself
up
in
business
and
with
credit
there
is
practically
no
limit
to
the
possibilities
of
fortune
it
is
simply
honest
nerve
that
counts
the
beggar
who
asks
you
on
the
street
for
five
cents
to
keep
his
family
from
starving
is
rebuffed
you
do
believe
his
story
and
you
know
that
five
cents
would
keep
a
family
from
starving
very
long
but
the
fellow
who
accosts
you
frankly
for
a
dime
because
he
is
thirsty
and
has
had
a
drink
for
two
hours
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
properly
selected
ones
will
get
a
quarter
for
his
nerve
you
ought
to
write
a
for
said
the
bibliomaniac
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
idiot
publishing
company
would
publish
it
yes
said
pedagog
a
sort
of
beggar
for
instance
it
would
be
a
benefit
to
all
men
as
well
as
a
boon
to
the
beggars
that
mendicancy
is
a
profession
there
is
no
denying
and
anything
which
could
make
of
it
a
polite
calling
would
be
of
inestimable
value
i
have
had
it
in
mind
for
some
time
said
the
idiot
blandly
i
intended
to
call
it
made
or
beggar
do
with
two
chapters
on
etiquette
for
the
chief
trouble
with
such
a
book
i
should
think
said
the
poet
would
be
that
your
beggars
and
tramps
could
not
afford
to
buy
it
that
would
interfere
with
its
circulation
returned
the
idiot
it
a
poor
tramp
who
ca
steal
every
suburban
resident
in
creation
would
buy
a
copy
of
the
book
out
of
sheer
curiosity
i
get
my
royalties
from
them
the
tramps
could
get
the
books
by
helping
themselves
to
the
suburbanites
copies
as
they
do
to
chickens
and
pies
put
out
to
cool
as
for
the
beggars
i
have
it
put
into
their
hands
by
the
people
they
beg
from
when
a
man
comes
up
to
a
wayfarer
for
instance
and
says
me
sir
but
could
you
spare
a
nickel
to
a
hungry
man
i
have
the
wayfarer
say
sir
but
unfortunately
i
have
left
my
nickels
in
my
other
vest
but
here
is
a
copy
of
the
idiot
made
easy
or
the
beggar
and
you
think
the
beggar
would
read
it
do
you
asked
the
bibliomaniac
i
do
know
whether
he
would
or
not
he
probably
either
read
it
or
pawn
it
the
idiot
answered
in
either
event
he
would
be
better
off
and
i
would
have
got
my
ten
per
cent
royalty
on
the
book
after
the
i
should
continue
my
good
work
if
i
found
the
class
for
whom
it
was
written
had
benefited
by
my
first
effort
i
should
compile
as
my
contribution
to
the
literature
of
mendicancy
for
the
following
season
what
i
should
call
beggar
élite
this
would
enlarge
my
sphere
a
trifle
it
would
contain
as
complete
lists
as
could
be
obtained
of
persons
who
give
to
street
beggars
with
their
addresses
so
that
the
beggars
instead
of
infesting
the
streets
at
night
might
go
to
the
houses
of
these
people
and
collect
their
incomes
in
a
more
and
less
undignified
fashion
added
to
this
would
be
two
lists
one
for
tramps
stating
what
families
in
the
suburbs
kept
dogs
what
families
gave
whether
what
they
gave
was
digestible
or
not
rounding
up
with
a
list
of
those
who
do
not
give
and
who
have
telephone
connection
with
the
police
station
this
would
enable
them
to
avoid
dogs
and
rebuffs
would
save
the
tramp
the
time
he
expends
on
futile
efforts
to
find
work
he
does
want
and
as
for
the
people
who
have
to
keep
the
dogs
to
ward
off
the
tramps
they
too
would
be
benefited
because
the
tramps
would
begin
to
avoid
them
and
in
a
short
while
they
would
be
able
to
dispense
with
the
dogs
the
other
list
would
be
for
who
are
after
all
only
beggars
of
a
different
type
this
list
would
comprise
the
names
of
persons
who
are
musical
and
who
would
rather
pay
a
quarter
than
listen
to
a
by
a
judicious
arrangement
with
these
people
carried
on
by
correspondence
the
would
be
able
to
collect
a
large
revenue
without
venturing
out
except
occasionally
to
play
before
the
house
of
a
delinquent
subscriber
in
order
to
remind
him
that
he
had
let
his
contract
expire
so
by
slow
degrees
we
should
find
beggars
doing
their
work
privately
and
not
publicly
tramps
circulating
only
among
those
whose
sympathies
they
have
aroused
and
only
a
memory
the
last
i
think
would
not
come
about
said
pedagog
for
there
are
people
who
like
the
music
of
true
i
one
of
i
hire
a
hansom
to
follow
a
about
the
city
if
i
could
afford
it
but
as
a
rule
the
lovers
are
of
the
class
returned
the
idiot
the
quarter
class
are
people
who
would
rather
not
hear
the
and
it
is
to
them
that
a
grinder
of
business
capacity
would
naturally
address
himself
it
is
far
pleasanter
to
stay
at
home
and
be
paid
large
money
for
doing
nothing
than
to
undertake
a
weary
march
through
the
city
to
receive
small
sums
for
doing
something
that
human
nature
mr
pedagog
i
presume
it
is
said
pedagog
but
i
do
think
your
scheme
is
human
nature
works
but
your
plan
would
well
of
course
said
the
idiot
you
never
can
tell
about
ideals
the
fact
that
an
ideal
is
ideal
is
the
chief
argument
against
its
amounting
to
much
but
i
am
confident
that
if
my
and
fail
my
other
book
will
go
you
appear
to
have
the
writing
of
a
library
in
mind
sneered
the
bibliomaniac
i
have
said
the
idiot
if
i
write
all
the
books
i
have
in
mind
the
public
library
will
be
a
small
affair
beside
mine
and
your
other
book
is
to
be
what
queried
whitechoker
tales
for
beggars
to
said
the
idiot
if
the
beggar
could
only
tell
an
interesting
story
he
be
surer
of
an
ear
in
which
to
whisper
it
the
usual
beggar
tale
is
commonplace
there
no
art
in
it
there
are
no
complications
of
absorbing
interest
there
is
not
a
soul
in
creation
i
venture
to
say
but
would
be
willing
to
have
a
beggar
stop
right
in
the
middle
of
his
story
the
tales
i
write
for
them
would
be
so
interesting
that
the
attention
of
the
wayfarer
would
be
arrested
at
once
his
mind
would
be
riveted
on
the
situation
at
once
and
instead
of
hurrying
along
and
trying
to
leave
the
beggar
behind
he
would
stop
him
and
ask
him
to
sit
down
on
a
convenient
doorstep
and
continue
if
a
beggar
could
have
such
a
story
to
tell
as
would
enable
him
in
the
midst
of
one
of
its
most
exciting
episodes
to
whisper
hoarsely
into
the
ear
of
the
man
whose
nickel
he
was
seeking
rest
of
this
interesting
story
i
will
tell
you
in
central
park
at
nine
night
in
such
a
manner
as
would
impel
the
listener
to
meet
him
in
the
park
the
following
evening
his
fortune
would
be
made
such
a
book
i
hope
some
day
to
write
i
have
no
doubt
said
whitechoker
that
it
will
be
an
entertaining
addition
to
fiction
nor
have
i
said
the
idiot
it
will
make
the
writers
of
green
with
envy
and
as
for
the
beggars
if
it
is
not
generally
known
that
it
is
i
and
not
they
who
are
responsible
for
the
work
the
beggars
will
shortly
find
themselves
in
demand
as
writers
of
fiction
for
the
magazines
and
you
suggested
the
poet
i
shall
be
content
mere
gratitude
will
force
the
beggars
to
send
me
the
magazine
orders
and
write
their
articles
and
be
glad
of
the
opportunity
giving
them
ten
per
cent
of
the
profits
i
know
a
man
who
makes
fifty
dollars
a
year
at
magazine
work
and
one
of
my
ambitions
is
to
rival
the
and
dry
goods
essayists
by
achieving
fame
as
the
dickens
viii
progressive
waffles
i
am
afraid
said
pedagog
in
a
loud
whisper
to
the
bibliomaniac
that
the
idiot
is
feeling
well
this
morning
he
has
eaten
three
and
a
waffle
without
opening
his
mouth
the
idiot
looked
up
and
gazing
wearily
at
pedagog
for
a
moment
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
ejaculated
tutt
he
off
said
the
bibliomaniac
whenever
he
says
you
can
make
up
your
mind
that
his
vocabulary
is
about
to
be
loosed
if
my
vocabulary
were
as
warped
as
some
other
vocabularies
i
might
mention
said
the
idiot
helping
himself
to
another
waffle
modelled
after
the
six
of
hearts
i
keep
it
in
a
cage
a
man
who
observes
that
i
have
eaten
three
and
a
waffle
without
opening
my
mouth
has
a
very
good
command
of
language
he
simply
states
as
a
fact
what
is
in
reality
an
impossibility
granting
that
i
eat
with
my
mouth
which
i
am
told
i
do
you
know
what
i
mean
retorted
pedagog
impatiently
i
am
so
much
in
your
society
that
i
have
acquired
the
very
bad
habit
of
speaking
in
the
vernacular
when
i
say
you
have
opened
your
mouth
i
do
not
refer
to
the
opening
you
make
for
the
receipt
of
waffles
and
but
for
those
massive
openings
which
you
require
for
your
exuberant
loquacity
in
other
words
i
mean
that
you
have
spoken
a
word
for
at
least
three
minutes
which
is
naturally
an
indication
to
us
that
you
are
feeling
well
you
and
talk
are
synonymous
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
i
been
known
to
speak
that
is
true
said
the
idiot
that
i
am
not
feeling
very
well
this
morning
is
also
true
i
have
a
headache
a
what
ache
asked
the
doctor
scornfully
a
very
bad
headache
returned
the
idiot
looking
about
him
for
a
third
waffle
how
singular
said
the
bibliomaniac
reminds
me
of
a
story
i
heard
of
a
man
who
had
lost
his
foot
he
had
his
foot
shot
off
at
gettysburg
and
yet
for
years
after
he
could
feel
the
pangs
of
rheumatism
in
that
foot
from
which
he
had
previously
suffered
pardon
me
for
repeating
observed
the
idiot
but
as
i
have
already
said
and
as
i
expect
often
to
have
to
say
again
tutt
i
ca
blame
you
for
thinking
that
i
have
no
head
however
i
find
so
little
use
for
one
here
that
in
most
instances
i
do
not
obtrude
it
upon
you
i
have
noticed
any
lack
of
head
in
the
idiot
put
in
the
as
a
rule
i
can
agree
to
almost
anything
my
friend
the
bibliomaniac
says
but
in
this
case
i
can
not
accept
his
views
you
have
a
head
i
have
always
said
you
had
a
head
in
fact
that
is
what
i
complain
about
chiefly
it
is
such
a
big
head
thank
you
said
the
idiot
ignoring
the
shaft
i
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
in
coming
to
my
aid
though
i
ca
say
that
i
think
i
needed
it
even
with
a
racking
headache
sustained
by
these
delicious
waffles
i
believe
i
can
handle
the
doctor
and
my
bookish
friend
without
assistance
i
am
what
the
mathematicians
would
call
an
arithmetical
absurdity
i
am
the
one
that
is
equal
to
the
two
they
represent
at
present
however
i
prefer
to
let
them
talk
on
i
am
too
much
absorbed
in
thought
and
waffles
to
bandy
words
if
i
had
a
headache
said
without
it
must
be
said
in
any
way
desiring
to
stem
the
waffle
tide
which
was
slowly
but
surely
eating
into
the
profits
of
the
week
if
i
had
a
headache
i
should
not
eat
so
many
waffles
mr
idiot
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
replied
the
idiot
but
i
ca
help
it
waffles
are
my
weakness
some
men
take
to
drink
some
to
gaming
i
seek
forgetfulness
of
woe
in
waffles
whitechoker
will
you
kindly
pass
me
that
steaming
ten
of
diamonds
that
is
wasting
its
warmth
upon
the
desert
air
before
you
whitechoker
with
a
sigh
which
indicated
that
he
had
had
his
eye
on
the
ten
of
diamonds
himself
did
as
he
was
requested
many
thanks
said
the
idiot
transferring
the
waffle
to
his
plate
let
me
see
that
is
how
many
five
said
pedagog
eight
said
the
bibliomaniac
dear
me
ejaculated
the
idiot
why
ca
you
agree
i
never
eat
less
than
twelve
waffles
and
now
that
you
have
failed
to
keep
tab
i
shall
have
to
begin
all
over
again
mary
bring
me
one
dozen
fresh
waffles
in
squads
of
four
this
is
an
ideal
breakfast
mrs
i
am
glad
you
are
pleased
said
the
landlady
graciously
my
one
aim
is
to
satisfy
you
are
a
better
shot
than
most
women
said
the
idiot
i
wonder
why
it
is
he
added
that
waffles
are
so
generally
modelled
after
and
also
why
having
been
modelled
after
there
is
not
a
full
pack
waffles
said
whitechoker
would
be
too
many
including
the
joker
said
pedagog
what
do
know
about
cards
john
asked
pedagog
severely
the
idiot
laughed
did
you
ever
hear
that
pretty
little
song
of
gilbert
and
sullivan
mr
poet
are
seldom
what
they
seem
he
asked
why
should
i
know
about
said
pedagog
acridly
whitechoker
seems
to
be
aware
that
a
pack
holds
cards
if
he
why
not
i
i
ah
i
of
course
have
to
acquaint
myself
with
many
vicious
things
with
which
i
have
very
little
sympathy
observed
whitechoker
blandly
i
regard
cards
as
an
abomination
so
do
i
said
pedagog
so
do
i
but
even
then
i
know
a
full
house
i
should
say
a
full
pack
from
a
er
a
er
flush
suggested
the
idiot
sir
said
pedagog
i
am
not
well
up
in
poker
terms
then
you
ought
to
play
said
the
idiot
the
man
who
does
know
the
game
has
usually
great
luck
but
i
am
sorry
pedagog
that
you
are
so
strongly
opposed
to
cards
for
i
was
going
to
make
a
suggestion
which
i
think
would
promote
harmony
in
our
little
circle
on
waffle
days
if
you
regard
cards
as
wholly
immoral
of
course
the
suggestion
is
without
value
since
it
involves
two
complete
packs
of
cards
one
cardboard
pack
and
one
waffle
pack
i
do
object
to
cards
as
cards
mr
idiot
said
the
landlady
it
is
the
games
people
play
with
cards
that
i
object
to
they
bring
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
misery
into
the
world
and
for
that
reason
i
think
it
is
better
to
avoid
them
altogether
that
is
quite
true
said
the
idiot
they
do
bring
about
much
unhappiness
i
know
a
young
woman
who
became
a
victim
of
insomnia
once
because
in
a
series
of
ten
games
of
old
maid
she
got
the
odd
card
seven
times
of
course
it
was
entirely
the
cards
fault
superstition
had
something
to
do
with
it
in
fact
i
sometimes
think
the
fault
lies
with
the
people
who
play
and
not
with
the
cards
i
owe
much
to
the
game
of
whist
it
taught
me
to
control
my
tongue
i
should
have
been
a
regular
if
it
had
been
for
whist
pedagog
looked
unutterable
things
at
the
idiot
are
you
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
you
have
any
control
over
your
tongue
he
asked
savagely
most
certainly
said
the
idiot
well
i
have
to
make
a
note
of
that
said
pedagog
i
have
a
friend
who
is
making
a
collection
of
hallucinations
if
you
give
me
his
address
said
the
idiot
i
send
him
thousands
for
five
dollars
a
dozen
i
invent
hallucinations
for
him
that
people
ought
to
have
but
have
no
returned
the
in
his
behalf
however
i
thank
you
he
collects
only
real
hallucinations
and
he
finds
there
are
plenty
of
them
without
retaining
a
professional
lunatic
to
supply
him
very
well
said
the
idiot
returning
to
his
waffles
if
at
any
time
he
finds
the
supply
running
short
i
shall
be
glad
to
renew
my
offer
you
have
unfolded
your
harmony
promoting
scheme
for
waffle
days
suggested
the
poet
it
has
aroused
my
interest
oh
it
is
simple
said
the
idiot
i
have
noticed
that
on
waffle
days
here
most
of
us
leave
the
table
more
or
less
dissatisfied
we
find
ourselves
plunged
into
acrimonious
discussions
which
to
my
mind
arise
entirely
from
the
waffles
pedagog
is
a
most
amiable
gentleman
and
yet
we
find
him
this
morning
full
of
acerbity
on
the
surface
of
things
i
seem
to
be
the
cause
of
his
anger
but
in
reality
it
is
not
i
but
the
waffles
he
has
seen
me
gradually
absorbing
them
and
it
has
irritated
him
every
waffle
that
i
eat
might
have
had
if
i
had
not
been
here
if
there
had
been
no
one
here
but
pedagog
he
would
have
had
all
the
waffles
as
it
is
his
supply
is
limited
this
affects
his
geniality
it
makes
him
pardon
me
said
pedagog
but
you
are
all
wrong
i
have
thought
of
the
things
at
all
consciously
to
yourself
you
have
not
said
the
idiot
subconsciously
however
you
have
the
philosophy
of
the
unconscious
teaches
us
that
unknown
to
ourselves
our
actions
are
directly
traceable
to
motives
we
wot
not
of
the
truth
of
this
is
conclusively
proven
in
this
case
even
when
i
point
out
to
you
the
facts
in
the
case
you
deny
their
truth
thereby
showing
that
you
are
not
conscious
of
the
real
underlying
motive
for
your
irritation
now
why
is
that
irritation
there
because
our
several
rights
to
the
individual
waffles
that
are
served
here
are
not
clearly
defined
at
the
outset
when
mary
brings
in
a
steaming
platter
full
of
these
delicious
creations
of
the
cook
pedagog
has
quite
as
much
right
to
the
one
with
the
six
of
hearts
on
it
as
i
have
but
i
get
it
he
does
not
hence
he
is
irritated
although
he
does
not
know
it
so
with
whitechoker
five
minutes
ago
he
was
hastening
through
the
four
of
spades
in
order
that
he
might
come
into
possession
of
the
ten
of
diamonds
that
lay
smoking
before
him
as
he
was
about
to
put
the
last
spade
in
his
mouth
i
requested
him
to
hand
me
the
ten
of
diamonds
having
myself
gulped
down
the
deuce
of
clubs
to
get
ahead
of
him
he
could
decline
to
give
me
that
waffle
because
he
wanted
it
himself
he
had
to
give
it
to
me
he
was
irritated
though
he
did
not
know
it
he
sighed
and
gave
me
the
waffle
i
did
want
it
said
whitechoker
but
i
did
not
know
that
i
sighed
there
you
are
said
the
idiot
it
is
the
philosophy
of
the
unconscious
again
if
you
are
not
conscious
of
so
actual
a
thing
as
a
sigh
how
much
the
more
unconscious
must
you
be
of
something
so
subtle
as
motive
and
your
said
the
genial
old
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibes
how
will
that
solve
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
to
complicate
the
problem
as
it
is
we
have
about
thirty
waffles
each
one
of
which
is
a
germ
of
irritation
in
the
breast
of
the
man
who
eat
it
if
you
have
waffles
you
have
more
germs
to
sow
discord
in
our
midst
you
would
have
but
for
my
scheme
said
the
idiot
i
have
a
pack
of
cards
at
the
table
and
i
deal
them
out
just
as
you
do
in
whist
each
card
would
represent
the
corresponding
waffle
we
begin
breakfast
by
playing
one
hand
after
the
manner
of
whist
each
man
would
keep
his
tricks
and
when
the
waffles
were
served
he
would
receive
those
and
those
only
represented
by
the
cards
in
the
tricks
he
had
taken
if
you
took
a
trick
with
the
king
of
diamonds
in
it
you
get
the
waffle
with
the
king
of
diamonds
on
it
and
so
on
every
man
would
be
clearly
entitled
through
his
skill
in
the
game
to
the
waffles
that
he
ate
very
good
said
whitechoker
but
suppose
you
had
bad
luck
and
took
no
tricks
then
said
the
idiot
you
have
bad
luck
and
get
no
waffles
tutt
said
pedagog
and
that
was
the
sole
criticism
any
of
the
boarders
had
to
make
although
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
scheme
had
objectionable
features
to
the
majority
of
them
for
as
yet
progressive
waffles
has
not
been
played
at
ix
a
for
poets
how
is
your
muse
these
days
mr
idiot
asked
the
bibliomaniac
one
sunday
morning
while
the
mush
was
being
served
flourishing
said
the
idiot
just
flourishing
and
no
more
i
should
think
you
be
pleased
if
she
is
flourishing
said
the
doctor
i
rather
she
stop
flourishing
and
do
a
little
writing
said
the
idiot
she
a
queer
muse
that
one
of
mine
she
has
all
the
airs
and
graces
of
an
ordinary
with
an
unconquerable
aversion
to
work
you
look
upon
your
muse
as
you
would
upon
your
eh
said
pedagog
yes
said
the
idiot
that
all
my
muse
is
and
she
is
even
a
capable
the
general
run
of
make
sense
of
what
you
write
but
my
muse
wo
you
may
not
believe
it
but
out
of
ten
inspirations
i
had
last
week
not
one
of
them
is
fit
for
publication
anywhere
but
in
a
magazine
or
a
puzzle
column
i
do
know
what
is
the
matter
with
her
but
when
i
sit
down
to
dictate
a
comic
sonnet
she
turns
it
into
a
serious
jingle
and
we
ca
seem
to
get
our
moods
to
fit
when
i
want
to
be
serious
she
flippant
and
when
i
become
flippant
she
serious
she
must
be
very
serious
most
of
the
time
said
the
doctor
she
is
said
the
idiot
innocently
but
that
only
because
flippant
most
of
the
time
i
going
to
give
her
warning
if
she
brace
up
and
take
more
interest
in
her
work
i
going
to
get
another
muse
that
all
i
ca
afford
to
have
my
income
cut
down
fifty
per
cent
just
because
she
happens
to
be
fickle
maybe
she
is
flirting
with
somebody
else
suggested
the
poet
my
muse
does
that
occasionally
i
doubt
it
said
the
idiot
i
have
observed
any
other
poet
encroaching
upon
my
particular
province
even
you
good
as
you
are
ca
do
it
but
in
any
event
i
going
to
have
a
change
the
day
has
gone
by
when
a
poet
achieves
greatness
i
going
to
employ
a
and
try
to
corner
the
poetry
market
queer
that
in
all
these
years
that
men
have
been
writing
poetry
no
one
has
thought
of
that
people
get
up
grain
corners
corners
in
railway
stock
monopolies
in
gas
and
oil
and
everything
else
about
but
as
yet
no
poet
has
cornered
the
market
in
his
business
that
easily
accounted
for
said
the
bibliomaniac
the
poet
controls
only
his
own
work
and
if
he
has
any
sense
he
does
want
to
monopolize
that
that
is
my
scheme
at
all
said
the
idiot
you
have
a
monopoly
of
your
own
work
always
if
you
choose
to
avail
yourself
of
it
and
as
you
say
a
man
would
be
crazy
to
do
so
what
i
like
to
see
established
is
a
sort
of
poetic
association
supposing
for
instance
that
i
opened
an
office
in
wall
street
a
bank
for
poets
in
which
all
writers
of
verse
could
deposit
their
rhymes
as
they
write
them
and
draw
against
them
just
as
they
do
in
ordinary
banks
with
their
money
it
would
be
fine
take
a
man
like
swinburne
for
instance
or
our
friend
here
our
poet
could
take
a
sonnet
he
had
written
endorse
it
and
put
it
in
the
bank
he
be
credited
with
one
sonnet
and
would
have
to
bother
his
head
about
it
afterwards
he
could
draw
against
it
if
the
company
could
dispose
of
it
to
a
magazine
his
draft
would
be
honored
in
cash
to
its
full
value
less
discount
charges
which
would
include
postage
and
commissions
to
the
company
and
suppose
the
company
failed
to
dispose
of
it
suggested
the
poet
they
do
just
as
ordinary
banks
do
with
checks
stamp
it
good
said
the
idiot
that
however
would
happen
very
often
if
the
concern
had
an
intelligent
to
detect
counterfeits
if
the
were
a
man
fit
for
the
position
and
a
poet
brought
in
a
quatrain
with
five
lines
in
it
he
could
detect
it
at
once
and
hand
it
back
so
with
comic
poems
i
might
go
there
with
a
poem
i
thought
was
comic
and
proceed
to
deposit
it
with
the
usual
deposit
slip
the
teller
would
look
at
it
a
second
scrutinize
the
humor
carefully
and
then
if
it
was
not
what
i
thought
it
would
stamp
it
comic
or
it
is
perfectly
simple
very
simple
said
pedagog
though
i
should
have
used
a
synonym
of
simple
to
describe
it
it
idiotic
that
what
people
said
of
columbus
idea
that
he
could
discover
america
said
the
idiot
everything
that
does
have
dollars
slathered
all
over
it
in
plain
view
is
idiotic
the
word
slathered
is
new
to
me
said
the
but
i
fancy
i
know
what
you
mean
the
word
slathered
may
be
new
to
you
said
the
idiot
but
it
is
a
good
word
i
have
used
it
with
great
effect
several
times
whenever
any
one
asks
me
that
foolish
question
that
is
asked
so
often
is
the
good
word
i
always
reply
and
the
fiend
goes
off
hurt
in
his
mind
he
does
know
what
i
mean
any
more
than
i
do
but
it
shuts
him
up
completely
which
is
just
so
much
gained
i
must
confess
said
the
poet
that
i
can
not
myself
see
where
there
is
any
money
for
your
rhyme
ordinarily
i
quite
approve
of
your
schemes
but
in
this
instance
i
go
over
to
the
enemy
i
do
say
that
it
is
a
said
the
idiot
i
doubt
if
i
had
every
cent
that
is
paid
for
poetry
in
a
year
by
everybody
to
everybody
that
my
income
would
reach
one
hundredth
part
of
what
i
receive
as
a
successful
manufacturer
of
soap
but
there
would
be
more
money
in
poetry
than
there
is
if
by
some
pooling
of
our
issues
we
could
corner
the
market
suppose
every
writer
of
a
quatrain
in
america
should
send
his
whole
product
to
us
we
could
say
to
the
magazines
quatrains
are
not
quatraining
as
hard
as
they
were
if
you
need
a
bit
of
gloom
and
rhyme
to
finish
off
your
page
our
price
is
dollars
instead
of
cents
as
of
yore
so
with
all
other
kinds
of
verse
we
simply
name
our
figure
force
the
editors
to
accept
it
and
unload
we
might
get
caught
on
the
last
thirty
or
forty
thousand
but
our
profits
on
the
others
would
enable
us
to
more
than
meet
the
losses
and
would
you
pay
the
author
the
dollars
asked
whitechoker
not
if
we
were
sane
replied
the
idiot
we
pay
the
author
two
dollars
and
fifty
cents
which
is
one
dollar
and
cents
more
than
he
gets
now
could
complain
and
those
that
you
could
sell
asked
the
bibliomaniac
we
simply
mark
good
and
return
to
the
author
that
what
happens
to
him
now
so
no
objection
could
be
raised
to
that
but
still
another
side
to
this
matter
said
the
idiot
publishers
would
be
quite
as
anxious
to
help
it
along
as
the
poets
dealing
through
us
they
would
be
spared
the
necessity
of
interviewing
poets
which
i
am
informed
is
always
painful
because
of
the
necessity
which
publishers
labor
under
to
give
the
poet
to
understand
that
they
are
in
the
business
for
profit
not
for
pleasure
or
mere
love
of
sinking
money
in
a
magazine
so
the
publishers
would
keep
a
standing
account
of
hard
cash
in
our
bank
say
a
magazine
used
one
hundred
dollars
worth
of
verse
in
a
month
the
publisher
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
would
deposit
twelve
hundred
dollars
with
us
and
throughout
the
year
would
draw
out
sonnets
ballads
or
just
as
he
needed
them
the
checks
would
read
something
like
this
poets
association
of
the
city
of
new
york
will
pay
to
john
bluepencil
editor
or
order
ten
sonnets
signed
blank
brothers
or
perhaps
we
receive
a
notice
from
a
southern
publisher
to
this
effect
drawn
on
you
at
sight
for
eight
quatrains
and
a
triolet
now
when
you
consider
how
many
publishers
there
are
who
would
always
keep
a
cash
balance
in
the
treasury
you
begin
to
get
some
notion
as
to
how
we
could
meet
our
running
expenses
and
pay
our
quarterly
dividends
to
our
stockholders
anyhow
and
as
for
future
dividends
i
believe
our
loan
department
would
net
us
a
sufficient
amount
to
make
the
stock
you
would
have
a
loan
department
eh
said
pedagog
that
would
be
popular
said
the
poet
but
there
again
i
dispute
the
profit
you
could
find
plenty
of
poets
who
would
borrow
your
funds
but
i
doubt
the
security
of
the
loans
all
of
your
objections
are
based
on
misconceptions
said
the
idiot
the
loan
department
would
not
lend
money
it
would
lend
poems
for
a
consideration
to
those
who
are
short
and
who
need
them
to
fulfil
their
obligations
who
on
earth
would
want
to
borrow
a
poem
i
like
to
know
said
the
bibliomaniac
lovers
chiefly
said
the
idiot
never
having
been
a
poet
yourself
sir
you
have
no
notion
how
far
the
mere
faculty
of
being
able
to
dash
off
a
sonnet
to
a
lady
eyebrow
helps
a
man
along
in
ultimately
becoming
the
possessor
of
that
eyebrow
together
with
the
rest
of
the
lady
have
seen
women
won
sir
by
a
rondeau
in
fact
i
have
myself
completely
routed
countless
unpoetic
rivals
by
exploding
in
their
ranks
burning
quatrains
to
the
fair
objects
of
our
affections
with
woman
the
man
who
can
write
a
hymn
of
thanksgiving
that
he
is
permitted
to
gaze
into
her
cerulean
orbs
has
a
great
advantage
over
the
wight
who
has
to
tell
her
she
has
dandy
blue
eyes
in
commonplace
prose
the
wight
knows
it
too
and
he
pay
ten
per
cent
of
his
salary
during
courtship
if
he
could
devise
a
plan
by
means
of
which
he
could
pass
himself
off
as
a
poet
to
meet
this
demand
our
loan
department
would
be
established
an
unimaginative
lover
could
come
in
and
describe
the
woman
he
adored
the
loan
clerk
would
fish
out
a
sonnet
to
fit
the
girl
and
the
lover
could
borrow
it
for
ten
days
just
as
brokers
borrow
stock
armed
with
this
he
could
go
up
to
harlem
or
wherever
else
the
maiden
lived
and
carry
consternation
into
the
hearts
of
his
rivals
by
spouting
the
sonnet
as
nonchalantly
as
though
he
had
just
thought
of
it
so
it
would
go
on
for
the
following
call
he
could
borrow
a
ballad
singing
the
glories
of
her
raven
locks
likening
them
to
the
beautiful
night
or
if
the
locks
were
red
instead
of
black
to
the
aurora
borealis
you
have
trouble
finding
a
rhyme
to
borealis
said
the
poet
tutt
said
the
idiot
what
the
matter
with
alice
to
my
story
alice
going
to
war
so
gory
alice
fear
you
are
a
tory
alice
this
for
a
revolutionary
poem
or
rowing
in
my
dory
alice
there
no
end
to
if
you
write
a
rhyming
dictionary
i
buy
a
copy
was
the
sole
comment
that
will
come
later
said
the
idiot
once
get
our
established
we
can
branch
out
into
a
general
poetry
trust
and
supply
company
that
will
make
millions
we
make
so
much
money
by
jove
he
added
slapping
the
table
enthusiastically
that
we
can
afford
to
go
into
the
publishing
business
ourselves
and
bring
out
volumes
of
verse
for
anybody
and
everybody
we
can
deal
in
fame
a
man
that
write
his
own
name
so
that
anybody
could
read
it
could
come
to
us
and
say
i
got
everything
but
brains
i
want
to
be
an
author
and
the
authors
stand
i
am
told
it
is
delightful
to
see
book
in
print
i
have
a
book
but
i
got
a
dollar
or
two
and
if
you
put
out
a
book
of
poems
under
my
name
i
pay
all
expenses
and
give
you
a
royalty
of
twenty
per
cent
on
every
copy
i
give
away
no
money
in
it
bah
you
gentlemen
do
know
if
you
say
fortune
would
not
wait
upon
this
venture
say
you
are
the
kind
of
men
who
would
sell
government
bonds
for
their
value
as
mere
engravings
if
you
had
the
chance
you
certainly
do
draw
a
roseate
picture
said
whitechoker
i
do
indeed
said
the
idiot
and
the
paint
is
laid
on
thick
well
i
hope
it
goes
said
the
poet
i
make
a
deposit
the
first
day
of
three
hundred
and
ballads
four
hundred
and
couplets
rondeaus
and
one
epic
about
ten
yards
in
length
all
of
which
i
have
in
my
desk
at
this
moment
very
well
said
the
idiot
rising
with
that
encouragement
from
you
i
feel
warranted
in
ordering
the
good
stamp
at
least
x
some
electrical
suggestions
if
i
were
beginning
life
all
over
again
said
the
idiot
i
be
an
electrician
it
seems
to
me
that
of
all
modern
pursuits
barring
architecture
perhaps
electricity
is
the
most
fascinating
there
probably
more
money
in
it
than
there
is
in
idiocy
too
i
fancy
said
the
bibliomaniac
dryly
well
i
should
think
so
assented
the
idiot
idiocy
is
merely
an
intellectual
diversion
electricity
is
a
practical
science
idiocy
can
not
be
said
to
be
anything
more
than
a
luxury
while
electricity
has
become
a
necessity
i
do
not
even
claim
that
any
real
lasting
benefit
can
come
to
the
world
through
idiocy
but
in
electricity
are
possibilities
not
yet
realized
for
which
the
world
will
be
distinctly
better
and
happier
it
is
kind
of
you
to
speak
so
highly
of
electricity
said
the
doctor
the
science
may
now
advance
knowing
that
you
approve
approve
cried
the
idiot
approve
is
not
the
word
sir
i
enthuse
and
why
should
i
not
feeling
as
i
do
that
in
the
electrical
current
lies
the
germ
of
the
elixir
of
life
i
thoroughly
believe
that
a
bottle
of
liquefied
electricity
would
make
us
all
young
then
do
take
it
said
the
you
have
suffered
from
an
aggravated
case
of
youngness
for
as
long
a
time
as
i
have
known
you
pray
do
nothing
to
intensify
your
youth
i
fear
i
shall
be
forced
to
deny
myself
that
pleasure
pedagog
returned
the
idiot
mildly
for
the
unhappy
reason
that
as
yet
the
formula
for
the
electrical
elixir
has
not
been
discovered
that
it
will
be
discovered
before
i
die
i
hope
and
pray
because
unlike
the
man
in
the
hymn
i
would
live
always
i
like
to
be
an
immortal
an
immortal
idiot
think
of
it
said
the
doctor
i
did
expect
much
sympathy
from
you
dr
capsule
said
the
idiot
the
man
with
to
sell
does
not
dote
upon
the
the
application
of
the
allegory
is
not
entirely
apparent
said
the
doctor
no
said
the
idiot
i
am
surprised
i
thought
you
intellectuals
absorbed
ideas
more
quickly
to
deal
in
plain
terms
since
it
appears
to
be
necessary
a
plan
which
involves
the
indefinite
extension
of
mortal
life
and
the
elimination
of
bodily
ills
is
not
likely
to
receive
the
hearty
endorsement
of
the
medical
profession
if
a
man
could
come
home
on
a
stormy
night
and
offset
the
deleterious
effects
of
wet
feet
by
swallowing
an
electric
pill
one
containing
two
volts
like
a
quinine
pill
for
instance
with
greater
certainty
than
one
feels
in
taking
quinine
your
profession
would
have
to
put
up
the
shutters
and
go
into
some
such
business
as
writing
articles
on
as
it
used
to
be
or
of
the
period
the
fine
part
of
it
all
is
that
we
should
not
have
to
rely
for
our
medicines
upon
the
state
of
the
arsenic
market
or
the
quinine
supply
or
the
squill
product
of
the
year
electric
sparks
can
be
made
without
number
whether
the
sun
shines
or
not
the
failure
of
the
peruvian
bark
crop
or
the
destruction
by
an
early
frost
of
the
castor
oil
wells
would
cease
to
be
a
hideous
possibility
to
delicate
natures
they
could
all
fail
for
all
mankind
need
fear
for
electricity
can
be
generated
when
and
wherever
one
has
need
of
it
if
your
electric
pills
were
used
up
and
the
chemist
too
far
away
from
your
house
for
you
to
get
the
supply
replenished
at
the
moment
you
could
put
on
your
slippers
and
by
walking
up
and
down
your
carpeted
floor
for
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
generate
enough
electricity
to
see
you
through
of
course
you
have
to
have
a
pair
of
slippers
to
catch
the
sparks
as
they
flew
but
i
fancy
they
be
less
costly
in
the
long
run
than
the
medicines
we
have
why
have
wet
feet
at
all
if
electricity
is
to
be
so
suggested
whitechoker
why
not
devise
an
electrical
and
ward
off
all
possibility
of
damp
cold
feet
you
could
do
that
with
men
and
women
constituted
as
they
are
said
the
idiot
your
would
no
doubt
be
a
good
thing
but
so
are
rubber
overshoes
nothing
will
ever
be
patented
to
compel
a
man
to
keep
his
feet
dry
and
he
wo
do
it
except
under
compulsion
but
once
having
his
feet
wet
he
will
seek
the
remedy
it
the
elixir
of
life
that
i
bank
on
most
however
i
do
believe
there
is
one
among
us
excepting
pedagog
to
whom
was
not
the
most
delightful
period
of
existence
to
pedagog
as
to
all
women
eighteen
is
the
limit
but
men
at
and
women
at
eighteen
know
so
much
enjoy
so
much
regard
themselves
so
highly
there
is
nothing
about
them
then
disillusion
which
i
think
ought
to
be
called
dissolution
comes
later
at
thirty
a
man
discovers
that
the
things
he
knew
at
are
so
and
as
for
a
woman
at
if
so
be
she
is
unmarried
her
life
is
empty
and
if
so
be
she
is
married
she
has
cares
in
the
shape
of
children
and
a
husband
who
as
a
theory
was
a
poet
but
who
as
a
reality
is
a
mere
business
machine
who
is
oftentimes
no
fonder
of
staying
at
home
than
he
was
before
he
was
married
and
went
out
to
see
her
every
night
what
a
wise
little
pessimist
he
is
said
pedagog
to
the
doctor
very
but
i
fail
to
comprehend
why
he
branches
off
into
pessimism
when
electricity
was
his
text
said
the
doctor
because
he
the
id
began
the
bibliomaniac
but
the
idiot
interrupted
him
do
jump
fences
gentlemen
before
you
know
whether
they
are
made
of
barbed
wire
or
not
i
coming
to
the
points
you
are
bringing
up
and
if
you
are
not
careful
they
may
puncture
you
he
said
i
am
not
in
any
sense
a
pessimist
quite
the
contrary
i
am
an
optimist
i
not
old
enough
or
enough
as
yet
to
be
a
pessimist
and
because
i
do
want
to
be
a
pessimist
that
i
want
this
elixir
of
electricity
to
hurry
up
and
have
itself
patented
if
men
when
they
reached
the
age
of
and
women
at
eighteen
would
begin
to
take
this
they
might
live
to
be
a
thousand
and
yet
retain
all
the
spirit
and
feelings
of
and
eighteen
that
the
connection
dr
capsule
if
i
could
be
all
my
life
i
be
as
happy
as
a
bird
and
if
i
were
the
poet
here
i
immortalize
that
idea
in
verse
a
man
the
biggest
thing
alive
when
he
has
got
to
and
as
for
woman
she
a
queen
whose
summers
number
just
eighteen
that
a
good
idea
returned
the
poet
i
make
a
note
of
that
and
if
i
sell
it
i
give
you
a
commission
no
do
do
that
said
the
idiot
slyly
i
shall
be
satisfied
to
see
your
name
in
print
the
poet
having
accepted
this
sally
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
intended
the
idiot
resumed
but
of
course
the
elixir
and
the
electrical
pills
are
as
yet
all
in
the
air
we
have
even
taken
a
step
in
that
direction
edison
and
other
wizards
have
been
too
much
occupied
with
electric
lights
and
telephones
and
phonographs
and
transatlantic
notions
to
pay
any
attention
to
schemes
to
prolong
life
and
keep
us
despite
our
years
perpetually
young
i
fancy
they
are
likely
to
continue
to
do
so
said
the
doctor
whatever
motive
you
may
attribute
to
me
for
your
notions
i
do
so
no
sane
person
wants
to
live
forever
and
if
it
were
possible
that
all
men
might
live
forever
you
soon
find
the
world
so
crowded
that
the
slighter
actors
in
the
human
comedy
would
be
shoved
off
the
stage
there
are
enough
people
in
the
world
now
without
man
adding
all
future
generations
to
their
number
and
making
death
an
impossibility
that
all
nonsense
said
the
idiot
my
elixir
would
make
death
an
impossibility
any
man
who
thought
he
had
enough
at
the
end
of
a
thousand
years
could
stop
taking
the
elixir
and
shuffle
off
the
mortal
coil
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
more
than
ten
per
cent
of
the
people
in
the
world
would
have
any
faith
in
the
elixir
at
all
i
know
people
who
do
not
take
advantage
of
the
many
patent
remedies
that
are
within
their
reach
preferring
the
and
of
their
forefathers
there
where
human
nature
works
again
i
believe
that
if
i
were
myself
the
discoverer
of
the
formula
for
my
mixture
and
for
an
advertisement
secured
a
letter
from
a
man
saying
was
dying
of
old
age
having
reached
the
advanced
period
of
i
took
two
bottles
of
your
electrical
elixir
and
am
now
celebrating
my
birthday
again
per
cent
of
the
people
who
read
it
would
laugh
and
think
it
had
strayed
out
of
the
funny
column
people
lack
confidence
in
their
that
all
but
if
they
were
and
eighteen
that
would
all
be
changed
we
are
very
trustful
at
and
eighteen
which
is
one
of
the
things
i
like
about
those
respective
ages
when
i
was
i
believed
in
everybody
including
myself
now
well
i
older
but
enough
of
schemes
which
i
must
admit
are
somewhat
visionary
as
the
telephone
would
have
seemed
one
hundred
years
ago
let
us
come
down
to
realities
in
electricity
i
ca
see
why
more
is
not
made
of
the
phonograph
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
take
a
man
like
chauncey
de
choate
he
goes
here
and
he
goes
there
to
make
speeches
when
i
no
doubt
he
much
prefer
to
stay
at
home
cutting
coupons
off
his
bonds
why
ca
the
phonograph
voice
do
duty
instead
of
making
the
same
speech
over
and
over
again
why
ca
some
electrician
so
improve
the
phonograph
that
de
choate
can
say
what
he
has
to
say
through
a
funnel
have
it
impressed
on
a
cylinder
duplicated
and
reduplicated
and
scattered
broadcast
over
the
world
if
edison
could
impart
what
poets
call
stentorian
tones
to
the
phonograph
he
be
doing
a
great
and
noble
work
again
for
smaller
things
like
a
dance
why
ca
the
phonograph
be
made
useful
at
a
ball
i
attended
one
the
other
night
and
when
i
wanted
to
dance
the
the
band
played
the
polka
if
i
wished
the
polka
it
played
a
waltz
some
men
can
only
dance
the
they
do
know
the
waltz
the
polka
or
the
schottische
now
why
ca
the
phonograph
come
to
the
rescue
in
almost
any
hotel
in
new
york
you
can
drop
a
nickel
in
a
slot
and
hear
sousa
band
on
the
phonograph
why
not
extend
the
principle
and
have
a
phonograph
for
men
who
can
dance
nothing
but
the
charged
with
washington
post
march
and
supplied
with
four
tubes
with
receivers
to
put
in
the
ears
of
the
listeners
make
it
small
enough
for
a
man
to
carry
in
his
pocket
then
at
a
ball
he
could
go
up
to
a
young
lady
ask
her
to
dance
put
two
of
the
receivers
in
her
ears
two
in
his
and
trip
the
light
fantastic
toe
utterly
independently
of
what
other
people
were
dancing
it
possible
edison
could
do
it
in
five
minutes
and
every
one
would
be
satisfied
it
might
be
rather
droll
to
see
two
people
dancing
the
while
eight
others
were
fastened
on
to
a
lanciers
phonograph
and
a
dozen
or
more
other
couples
were
dancing
respectively
the
waltz
schottische
and
virginia
reel
but
we
soon
get
used
to
that
and
no
man
need
become
a
because
he
could
dance
the
dance
that
happened
to
be
on
furthermore
you
be
able
to
do
away
with
the
musicians
who
always
cast
a
pall
over
dances
because
of
their
superiority
to
the
rest
of
the
world
in
general
and
the
dancers
in
particular
how
about
your
couple
that
prefer
to
sit
out
the
dance
on
the
stairs
said
the
poet
who
in
common
with
the
idiot
knew
several
things
about
dances
that
pedagog
and
whitechoker
did
not
it
would
be
particularly
attractive
to
them
said
the
idiot
they
could
sit
on
the
stairs
and
wax
sentimental
over
any
dreamy
air
the
man
happened
to
have
in
his
he
could
arrange
all
that
beforehand
find
out
what
song
she
thought
divinest
and
go
loaded
accordingly
and
as
for
the
things
that
usually
happen
on
stairs
at
dances
as
well
as
in
conservatories
at
balls
with
the
aid
of
a
phonograph
a
man
could
propose
to
a
girl
in
the
presence
of
a
thousand
people
and
nobody
but
the
maiden
herself
would
be
the
wiser
i
tell
you
gentlemen
the
idiot
added
enthusiastically
as
he
rose
to
depart
if
the
phonograph
people
only
knew
their
power
they
do
great
things
the
patent
phonograph
for
music
at
balls
and
proposals
for
bashful
men
alone
would
make
their
fortunes
if
they
only
could
see
it
i
almost
wish
i
were
an
electrician
and
not
an
idiot
with
which
he
left
the
room
and
pedagog
whispered
to
pedagog
that
while
he
considered
the
idiot
very
much
of
an
idiot
there
was
no
denying
that
at
times
he
did
get
hold
of
ideas
that
were
not
wholly
bad
that
true
said
the
good
landlady
i
think
if
you
had
proposed
to
me
through
a
phonograph
i
should
not
have
had
to
guess
at
what
you
meant
and
lead
you
on
to
express
yourself
more
clearly
i
did
want
to
say
yes
until
i
was
fully
convinced
that
you
meant
what
you
did
seem
able
to
say
xi
concerning
children
the
poet
had
been
away
for
a
week
and
on
his
return
to
his
accustomed
post
at
the
seemed
but
a
shadow
of
his
former
self
his
eyes
were
heavy
and
his
long
locks
appeared
straggly
enough
for
a
man
of
far
more
extended
reputation
as
a
singer
of
melodious
verse
to
judge
from
your
appearance
mr
poet
said
the
idiot
after
welcoming
his
friend
you
had
a
lively
vacation
you
certainly
do
not
look
as
if
you
had
devoted
much
of
it
to
sleep
i
have
said
the
poet
wearily
i
have
averaged
more
than
two
hours
of
sleep
daily
since
i
went
away
i
thought
you
told
me
you
were
going
off
into
the
country
for
a
rest
observed
the
idiot
i
did
and
this
is
what
comes
of
it
returned
the
poet
i
went
to
visit
my
sister
up
in
saratoga
county
she
has
seven
children
aha
smiled
the
idiot
that
it
is
it
well
i
can
sympathize
with
you
i
had
experience
with
youngsters
myself
i
love
but
i
like
to
take
on
the
instalment
plan
very
little
at
a
time
i
have
a
small
cousin
with
a
capacity
for
play
and
impudence
that
ca
be
equalled
his
mother
wrote
me
once
and
asked
if
i
thought
hagenbeck
the
tamer
could
be
induced
to
take
him
in
hand
that
the
kind
put
in
the
poet
his
face
lighting
up
a
little
upon
discovering
that
there
was
some
one
at
least
at
the
board
who
could
sympathize
with
him
my
sister
seven
are
all
of
the
variety
i
rather
fall
in
with
seven
tigers
than
put
in
another
week
with
my
beloved
nephews
and
nieces
did
they
play
alp
with
you
the
idiot
asked
with
a
grin
alp
said
the
poet
no
not
that
i
know
of
they
may
have
however
i
was
hardly
conscious
of
what
they
were
doing
the
last
two
days
of
my
stay
there
they
simply
overpowered
me
and
i
gave
in
and
became
a
toy
for
the
time
it
is
much
fun
being
a
toy
said
the
idiot
i
think
i
rather
play
alp
what
on
earth
is
alp
asked
pedagog
his
curiosity
aroused
heard
enough
absurd
names
for
games
in
the
last
five
years
but
i
must
say
for
pure
idiocy
and
lack
of
suggestiveness
the
name
of
alp
surpasses
all
that
as
it
should
be
said
the
idiot
my
small
cousin
invented
alp
and
anything
that
boy
does
is
apt
to
surpass
all
he
takes
after
me
in
some
things
but
alp
while
it
may
seem
to
lack
suggestiveness
as
a
name
is
really
just
the
name
for
the
game
it
very
simple
it
is
played
by
one
alp
and
as
many
chamois
as
desire
to
take
a
hand
as
a
rule
the
man
plays
the
alp
and
the
children
are
the
chamois
the
man
gets
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
puts
his
head
on
the
floor
and
has
a
white
rug
put
on
his
back
the
idea
being
that
he
is
an
alp
and
the
rug
represents
its
top
and
the
chamois
asked
whitechoker
the
chamois
climbs
the
alp
and
jumps
about
on
the
top
of
it
said
the
idiot
my
experience
based
upon
two
hours
a
day
of
it
for
ten
consecutive
days
is
that
it
fun
for
the
chamois
but
rough
on
the
alp
and
i
got
so
after
a
while
that
i
really
preferred
business
to
pleasure
and
gave
up
playing
alp
to
return
to
work
before
my
vacation
was
half
over
how
do
you
score
in
this
game
of
alp
said
pedagog
smiling
broadly
as
he
thought
of
there
being
an
embryo
idiot
somewhere
who
could
discomfit
the
one
fate
had
thrown
across
his
path
i
never
had
the
strength
to
inquire
said
the
idiot
but
my
impression
is
that
the
game
is
to
see
which
has
the
greater
endurance
the
chamois
or
the
alp
the
one
that
gets
tired
of
playing
first
loses
i
always
lost
my
small
cousin
is
a
storehouse
of
nervous
energy
i
believe
he
could
play
cars
with
a
real
engine
and
last
longer
than
the
engine
which
being
the
case
i
could
hope
to
hold
out
against
him
my
nephews
did
play
alp
said
the
poet
i
believe
alp
would
have
been
a
positive
relief
to
me
they
made
me
tell
them
stories
and
poems
from
morning
until
night
and
all
night
too
for
one
of
them
shared
his
room
with
me
and
the
worst
of
it
all
was
that
they
all
had
to
be
new
stories
and
new
poems
so
i
was
kept
composing
from
one
week
end
to
the
other
why
were
you
firm
with
them
and
say
you
would
and
let
that
end
it
said
pedagog
ha
ha
laughed
the
idiot
that
fine
is
it
mr
poet
it
very
evident
pedagog
that
you
not
acquainted
with
children
now
my
small
cousin
can
make
the
same
appeal
over
and
over
again
in
a
hundred
and
fifty
different
ways
you
may
have
the
courage
to
say
no
a
hundred
and
times
but
i
have
yet
to
meet
the
man
who
could
make
his
no
good
with
a
boy
of
real
persistent
spirit
i
ca
do
it
tried
but
i
had
to
give
in
sooner
or
later
same
way
with
me
multiplied
by
seven
said
the
poet
with
difficulty
repressing
a
yawn
i
tried
the
no
business
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
and
gave
it
up
as
a
hopeless
case
before
the
clock
struck
twelve
i
teach
said
pedagog
you
have
to
learn
first
retorted
the
idiot
you
ca
do
anything
with
children
unless
you
understand
them
you
got
to
remember
several
things
when
you
have
small
boys
to
deal
with
in
the
first
place
they
are
a
great
deal
more
alert
than
you
are
they
are
a
great
deal
more
energetic
they
know
what
they
want
and
in
getting
it
they
have
any
dignity
to
restrain
them
wherein
they
have
a
distinct
advantage
over
you
worst
of
all
down
in
your
secret
heart
you
want
to
laugh
even
when
they
most
affront
you
i
do
said
pedagog
shortly
and
why
because
you
do
know
them
can
not
sympathize
with
them
and
look
upon
them
as
evils
to
be
tolerated
rather
than
little
minds
to
be
cultivated
hard
a
time
as
i
have
had
as
an
alp
i
feel
as
if
a
great
hole
had
been
punched
in
my
life
if
anything
should
deprive
me
of
my
cousin
sammie
he
knows
it
and
i
know
it
and
that
is
why
we
are
chums
said
the
idiot
what
i
like
about
sammie
is
that
he
believes
in
me
he
added
a
little
wistfully
i
would
mind
doing
that
myself
if
i
could
you
might
think
differently
if
you
suffered
from
seven
sammies
the
way
the
poet
does
said
the
bibliomaniac
there
could
be
seven
sammies
said
the
idiot
sammie
is
unique
to
me
but
i
am
not
at
all
narrow
in
this
matter
i
can
very
well
imagine
how
sammie
could
be
very
disagreeable
to
some
people
i
should
care
much
for
alp
i
suppose
if
when
night
came
on
sammie
did
climb
up
on
my
lap
and
tell
me
he
thought
i
was
the
greatest
man
that
ever
lived
next
to
his
mother
and
father
that
the
thing
pedagog
that
makes
alp
tolerable
it
the
sugar
sauce
to
the
batter
pudding
there
a
good
deal
of
plain
batter
in
the
pudding
but
with
the
sauce
generously
mixed
in
you
do
mind
it
so
much
that
boy
would
be
willing
to
go
to
sleep
on
a
railway
track
if
i
told
him
i
stand
between
him
and
the
express
train
if
i
told
him
i
could
hammer
down
gibraltar
with
putty
he
believe
it
and
bring
me
his
to
help
along
in
the
great
work
that
why
i
think
a
man
so
much
better
off
if
he
is
a
father
somebody
has
fixed
a
standard
for
him
which
while
he
may
know
he
ca
live
up
to
it
he
try
to
live
up
to
and
by
aiming
high
he
wo
be
so
apt
to
hit
low
as
he
otherwise
might
as
sammie
father
once
said
to
me
jove
idiot
he
said
men
could
be
what
their
children
think
them
nevertheless
they
should
be
governed
curbed
brought
up
said
the
bibliomaniac
they
should
indeed
said
the
idiot
and
in
such
a
fashion
that
when
they
are
governed
curbed
and
brought
up
they
do
not
realize
that
they
have
been
governed
curbed
and
brought
up
the
man
who
plays
the
tyrant
with
his
children
is
the
man
for
me
give
me
the
man
who
like
my
father
is
his
son
intimate
personal
friend
his
confidant
his
chum
it
may
have
worked
badly
in
my
case
i
do
think
it
has
in
any
event
if
i
were
ever
the
father
of
a
boy
i
try
to
make
him
feel
that
i
was
not
a
despot
in
whose
hands
he
was
powerless
but
a
mainstay
to
fall
back
on
when
things
seemed
to
be
going
wrong
of
good
advice
a
sympathizer
in
short
a
chum
you
certainly
draw
a
pleasant
picture
said
whitechoker
kindly
thank
you
said
the
idiot
it
not
original
with
me
my
father
drew
it
but
despite
my
personal
regard
for
sammie
i
do
think
something
ought
to
be
done
to
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
the
parent
take
the
mother
of
a
boy
like
sammie
for
instance
she
has
him
all
day
and
generally
all
night
sammie
father
goes
to
business
at
eight
and
returns
at
six
thinking
he
has
worked
hard
and
wonders
why
it
is
that
sammie
mother
looks
so
confoundedly
tired
it
makes
him
slightly
irritable
she
has
been
at
home
taking
things
easy
all
day
he
has
been
in
town
working
like
a
dog
what
right
has
she
to
be
tired
he
realize
that
she
has
had
to
entertain
sammie
at
those
hours
of
the
day
when
sammie
is
in
his
best
form
she
has
found
him
trying
to
turn
somersaults
at
the
top
of
the
back
stairs
she
has
patiently
borne
his
musical
efforts
on
the
piano
upon
which
he
practises
daily
for
a
few
minutes
generally
with
a
hammer
or
a
stick
or
something
else
equally
well
calculated
to
beautify
the
keys
she
has
had
to
interfere
in
sammie
efforts
to
instruct
his
small
brother
in
the
art
of
being
an
indian
who
can
whoop
and
scalp
all
in
the
same
breath
thereby
incurring
for
the
moment
sammie
undying
hatred
she
has
heard
sammie
using
language
which
an
inconsiderate
hired
man
has
not
scrupled
to
use
in
sammie
presence
she
has
with
terror
in
her
soul
watched
him
at
play
with
a
knife
which
some
friend
of
the
family
who
admires
sammie
had
given
him
and
has
again
incurred
his
enmity
by
finally
to
avoid
nervous
prostration
taken
that
treasure
from
him
in
short
she
has
passed
a
day
of
real
tragedy
sammie
is
farce
to
me
comedy
to
his
father
and
tragedy
to
his
mother
can
not
something
be
done
for
her
is
there
no
way
by
means
of
which
sammie
can
be
entertained
during
the
day
for
entertained
he
must
be
that
does
not
utterly
destroy
the
nervous
system
of
his
mother
ca
some
inventive
genius
who
has
studied
the
small
boy
who
knows
the
little
ins
and
outs
of
his
nature
and
who
above
all
sympathizes
with
those
ins
and
outs
put
his
mind
on
the
life
of
the
woman
of
domestic
inclination
and
do
something
to
make
her
life
less
of
a
burden
and
more
of
a
joy
you
are
the
man
to
do
it
said
the
bibliomaniac
an
inventive
genius
such
as
you
are
ought
to
be
able
to
solve
the
problem
perhaps
he
ought
to
be
said
the
idiot
but
we
are
not
all
what
we
ought
to
be
i
among
the
number
almost
anything
seems
possible
to
me
until
i
think
of
the
mother
at
home
all
day
with
a
dear
sweet
bright
energetic
boy
like
sammie
then
i
confess
i
am
utterly
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
and
then
as
none
of
the
boarders
had
any
solution
of
the
problem
to
suggest
i
presume
there
was
none
among
them
who
knew
how
to
be
tranquil
though
a
mother
perhaps
when
women
take
up
invention
matters
will
seem
more
hopeful
xii
dreamaline
well
mr
idiot
said
pedagog
as
the
guests
gathered
about
the
table
how
goes
the
noble
art
of
invention
with
you
you
been
at
it
for
some
time
now
do
you
find
that
you
have
succeeded
in
your
mission
and
made
the
condition
of
the
civilized
less
unbearable
frankly
pedagog
i
have
failed
said
the
idiot
sadly
failed
egregiously
i
can
not
find
that
of
all
the
many
schemes
i
have
evolved
for
the
benefit
of
the
human
race
any
single
one
has
been
adopted
by
those
who
would
be
benefited
wherefore
with
the
exception
of
dreamaline
which
i
have
not
yet
developed
to
my
satisfaction
i
shall
do
no
more
inventing
what
is
the
use
even
you
gentlemen
here
have
tacitly
declined
to
accept
my
plan
for
the
elimination
of
irritation
on
waffle
days
a
plan
at
once
simple
picturesque
and
efficacious
with
such
discouragement
at
home
what
hope
have
i
for
better
fortune
abroad
it
is
dreadful
to
be
an
unappreciated
genius
said
the
bibliomaniac
gruffly
it
better
to
be
a
plain
lunatic
a
plain
lunatic
is
at
least
free
from
the
consciousness
of
failure
nevertheless
i
rather
be
myself
than
any
one
else
at
this
board
rejoined
the
idiot
unappreciated
though
i
be
i
am
at
least
happy
consciousness
of
failure
need
not
necessarily
destroy
one
happiness
if
i
do
the
best
i
can
with
the
tools
i
have
i
need
weep
because
i
fail
and
with
his
consciousness
of
failure
the
unappreciated
genius
always
has
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
it
is
not
he
but
the
world
that
is
wrong
if
i
am
a
philanthropist
and
offer
a
thousand
dollars
to
a
charity
and
the
charity
declines
to
accept
it
because
i
happen
to
have
made
it
out
of
my
interest
in
widows
and
orphans
speculation
company
large
losses
a
surety
it
is
the
charity
that
loses
not
i
so
with
my
plans
social
expansion
is
not
taken
up
by
society
who
dies
i
or
society
capitalists
decline
to
consider
my
proposition
for
a
general
poetry
trust
and
supply
company
who
loses
a
fine
chance
i
or
the
capitalists
i
may
be
a
little
discouraged
for
the
time
being
but
what
of
that
invention
is
the
only
occupation
in
the
world
for
me
i
can
give
up
philanthropy
and
take
up
misanthropy
in
a
moment
if
i
want
to
and
with
dreamaline
i
can
rule
the
world
ah
just
what
is
this
dreamaline
asked
whitechoker
interested
that
sir
is
the
question
which
i
am
now
trying
to
answer
for
myself
returned
the
idiot
if
i
could
answer
it
as
i
have
said
i
could
rule
the
world
everybody
could
rule
the
world
that
is
to
say
his
own
world
it
is
based
on
an
old
idea
which
has
been
found
by
some
to
be
practicable
but
it
has
never
been
developed
to
the
point
which
i
hope
to
attain
wake
me
up
when
he
gets
to
the
point
will
you
kindly
whispered
the
doctor
to
the
bibliomaniac
if
you
sleep
until
then
you
never
wake
said
the
bibliomaniac
to
my
mind
the
idiot
never
comes
to
a
point
you
are
a
little
too
mysterious
for
me
observed
whitechoker
i
know
no
more
about
dreamaline
now
than
i
did
when
you
began
which
is
my
case
exactly
said
the
idiot
it
is
a
vague
shadowy
something
as
yet
it
is
only
a
germ
lost
in
my
cerebral
wrinkles
but
i
hope
by
a
persistent
smoothing
out
of
those
wrinkles
with
what
i
might
call
the
of
thought
i
may
yet
lay
hold
of
the
microbe
and
with
it
electrify
the
world
once
dreamaline
is
discovered
all
other
discoveries
become
as
nothing
all
other
inventions
for
the
amelioration
of
the
condition
of
the
civilized
will
be
unnecessary
and
even
progressive
waffles
will
cease
to
fascinate
perhaps
said
the
bibliomaniac
if
you
will
give
us
a
hint
as
to
the
nature
of
your
plan
in
general
we
may
be
able
to
help
you
in
carrying
it
out
the
doctor
might
said
the
idiot
my
genial
friend
who
occasionally
imbibes
might
even
the
poet
with
his
taste
for
welsh
rarebits
might
but
from
you
and
pedagog
and
whitechoker
i
fear
i
should
receive
little
assistance
indeed
i
am
not
sure
but
that
whitechoker
might
disapprove
of
the
plan
altogether
any
plan
which
makes
life
happier
and
better
is
sure
to
meet
with
my
approval
said
whitechoker
with
that
encouragement
then
said
the
idiot
i
will
endeavor
to
lay
before
you
my
crowning
invention
dreamaline
as
its
name
may
suggest
should
be
a
patent
medicine
by
taking
which
man
should
become
oblivious
to
care
what
the
matter
with
champagne
for
that
interrupted
the
genial
old
gentleman
who
occasionally
imbibes
champagne
has
some
good
points
said
the
idiot
but
there
are
two
drawbacks
the
effects
and
the
price
both
of
these
drawbacks
so
far
from
making
us
oblivious
to
our
cares
add
to
them
the
superiority
of
dreamaline
over
champagne
or
even
over
beer
which
is
comparatively
cheap
is
that
one
dose
of
dreamaline
costing
one
cent
will
do
more
for
the
patient
than
one
case
of
champagne
or
one
keg
of
beer
it
is
not
intoxicating
or
ruinous
to
the
purse
furthermore
it
is
more
potent
for
good
since
under
its
genial
influences
man
can
do
that
to
which
he
aspires
or
what
is
perhaps
better
yet
merely
imagine
that
he
is
doing
that
to
which
he
aspires
and
so
avoid
the
disappointment
which
i
am
told
always
comes
with
ambition
achieved
take
for
instance
the
literary
man
we
know
of
many
cases
in
which
the
literary
man
has
stimulated
his
imagination
by
means
of
drugs
and
while
under
the
influence
has
penned
the
most
marvellous
tales
that
man
sacrifices
himself
for
the
delectation
of
others
in
order
to
write
something
for
the
world
to
rave
over
he
takes
a
dose
which
makes
him
rave
and
which
ultimately
kills
him
dreamaline
will
make
this
entirely
unnecessary
instead
of
the
writers
taking
hasheesh
the
reader
takes
dreamaline
instead
of
one
man
having
to
smoke
opium
for
millions
the
millions
take
dreamaline
for
themselves
as
individuals
i
would
have
the
scientists
then
the
chemists
study
the
subject
carefully
decide
what
quality
it
is
in
hasheesh
that
makes
a
writer
conceive
of
these
horrible
situations
put
this
into
a
nostrum
and
sell
it
to
those
who
like
horrible
situations
and
let
them
dream
their
own
stories
very
interesting
said
the
bibliomaniac
but
all
readers
do
not
like
horrible
situations
we
are
not
morbid
for
which
we
should
be
devoutly
thankful
said
the
idiot
but
your
point
is
not
well
taken
on
each
bottle
of
what
i
should
call
dreamaline
to
distinguish
it
from
dreamaline
dreamaline
and
so
on
i
should
have
printed
explicit
directions
showing
consumers
how
the
dose
should
be
modified
to
meet
the
taste
one
man
likes
a
de
maupassant
story
let
him
take
his
dreamaline
straight
lie
down
and
dream
he
get
his
de
maupassant
story
with
a
vengeance
another
likes
the
modern
story
in
realism
a
story
in
which
a
prize
might
be
offered
to
the
reader
who
finds
a
situation
an
incident
in
the
three
hundred
odd
pages
of
the
book
he
reads
this
man
could
take
a
spoonful
of
dreamaline
and
dilute
it
to
his
taste
a
drop
of
dreamaline
which
taken
raw
would
give
a
man
a
dream
like
doctor
jekyll
and
hyde
put
into
a
hogshead
of
pure
water
would
enable
the
man
who
took
a
spoonful
of
it
before
going
to
bed
to
fall
asleep
and
walk
through
a
novel
by
henry
james
thus
every
man
could
get
what
he
wanted
at
small
expense
dreamaline
for
readers
sold
at
a
dollar
a
quart
would
give
every
consumer
as
big
and
varied
a
library
as
he
wished
and
would
be
a
great
saving
to
the
eyes
people
would
have
more
time
for
other
pleasures
if
by
taking
a
dose
of
dreamaline
before
retiring
they
could
get
all
their
literature
in
their
sleeping
hours
then
every
bottle
would
pay
for
itself
ten
times
over
if
on
awakening
the
next
morning
the
consumer
would
write
out
the
story
he
had
dreamed
and
publish
it
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
were
afraid
to
take
the
medicine
you
would
make
much
money
out
of
it
though
said
the
poet
if
one
bottle
sufficed
for
a
library
you
would
find
much
of
a
demand
that
could
be
got
around
in
two
ways
said
the
idiot
we
could
copyright
every
bottle
of
dreamaline
and
require
the
consumers
to
pay
us
a
royalty
on
every
book
inspired
by
it
or
we
could
ourselves
take
what
i
would
call
financial
dreamaline
one
dose
of
which
would
make
a
man
feel
like
a
millionaire
life
is
only
feeling
after
all
if
you
feel
like
a
millionaire
you
are
as
happy
as
a
millionaire
happier
in
fact
because
in
reality
you
do
not
have
to
wear
your
thumbs
out
cutting
coupons
on
the
first
of
every
month
then
i
should
have
art
dreamaline
you
could
have
it
arranged
so
that
by
a
certain
dose
you
could
have
old
masters
all
over
your
house
by
another
dose
you
could
get
a
collection
of
modern
french
paintings
and
by
swallowing
a
whole
bottle
you
could
dream
that
your
walls
were
lined
with
mysteries
that
would
drive
the
impressionists
crazy
with
envy
in
scientific
dreamaline
you
would
get
ideas
for
invention
that
would
revolutionize
the
world
how
about
the
poets
and
the
humorists
asked
the
poet
they
be
easy
said
the
idiot
i
would
have
any
hasheesh
in
the
mixture
for
them
welsh
rarebit
would
do
and
you
get
poems
so
mysterious
and
jokes
so
uproarious
that
the
whole
world
would
soon
be
filled
with
wonder
and
with
laughter
in
short
dreamaline
would
go
into
every
walk
of
life
music
letters
art
poetry
finance
every
man
according
to
his
bent
or
his
tastes
could
partake
every
man
could
make
with
it
his
own
little
world
in
which
he
was
himself
the
prime
mover
and
so
harmless
would
it
be
that
when
next
morning
he
awoke
he
would
be
as
tranquil
and
as
happy
as
a
babe
i
hope
gentlemen
to
see
the
day
when
dreamaline
is
an
established
fact
when
we
can
not
enter
a
household
in
the
land
that
does
not
have
hanging
on
its
walls
after
the
manner
of
those
glass
fire
a
wire
rack
holding
a
row
of
bottles
labelled
art
letters
music
and
so
on
instead
of
libraries
and
laboratories
the
rich
and
the
poor
alike
may
have
it
the
child
who
loves
to
have
stories
told
to
him
will
cry
for
it
the
poor
wanderer
who
loves
opera
and
can
not
afford
even
to
pass
the
in
a
can
go
into
a
and
for
a
cent
begged
of
a
pedestrian
on
the
street
purchase
a
sufficient
quantity
to
imagine
himself
a
the
ambitious
statesman
can
through
its
influences
enjoy
the
sensation
of
thinking
himself
president
of
the
united
states
not
a
man
woman
or
child
lives
but
would
find
it
a
boon
and
as
harmless
as
a
graham
cracker
that
gentlemen
is
my
crowning
invention
and
until
i
see
it
realized
i
invent
no
more
and
in
a
moment
he
was
gone
well
said
pedagog
that
the
cap
to
the
climax
yes
said
where
do
you
suppose
he
got
the
idea
asked
the
bibliomaniac
i
do
know
said
the
doctor
but
i
suspect
that
without
knowing
it
he
had
some
of
the
stuff
he
describes
most
of
his
schemes
indicate
it
and
dreamaline
i
think
proves
it
the
end
