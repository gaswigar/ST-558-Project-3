tale
goes
that
herne
the
hunter
sometime
a
keeper
here
in
windsor
forest
doth
all
the
winter
time
at
still
midnight
walk
round
about
an
oak
with
great
ragg
horns
and
there
he
blasts
the
tree
and
takes
the
cattle
and
makes
yield
blood
and
shakes
a
chain
in
a
most
hideous
and
dreadful
manner
you
have
heard
of
such
a
spirit
and
well
you
know
the
superstitious
eld

this
tale
of
herne
the
hunter
for

book
anne

i
of
the
earl
of
surrey
solitary
ramble
in
the
home
park
of
the
vision
beheld
by
him
in
the
haunted
dell
and
of
his
meeting
with
morgan
fenwolf
the
keeper
beneath
oak
in
the
twentieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
right
high
and
puissant
king
henry
the
eighth
namely
in
on
the
of
april
and
on
one
of
the
loveliest
evenings
that
ever
fell
on
the
loveliest
district
in
england
a
fair
youth
having
somewhat
the
appearance
of
a
page
was
leaning
over
the
terrace
wall
on
the
north
side
of
windsor
castle
and
gazing
at
the
magnificent
scene
before
him
on
his
right
stretched
the
broad
green
expanse
forming
the
home
park
studded
with
noble
trees
chiefly
consisting
of
ancient
oaks
of
which
england
had
already
learnt
to
be
proud
thorns
as
old
or
older
than
the
oaks
beeches
tall
elms
and
hollies
the
disposition
of
these
trees
was
picturesque
and
beautiful
in
the
extreme
here
at
the
end
of
a
sweeping
vista
and
in
the
midst
of
an
open
space
covered
with
the
greenest
sward
stood
a
mighty
oak
beneath
whose
ample
boughs
though
as
yet
almost
destitute
of
foliage
while
the
sod
beneath
them
could
scarcely
boast
a
head
of
fern
couched
a
herd
of
deer
there
lay
a
thicket
of
thorns
skirting
a
burrowed
by
rabbits
on
this
hand
grew
a
dense
and
grove
into
whose
intricacies
the
slanting
sunbeams
pierced
on
that
extended
a
long
glade
formed
by
a
natural
avenue
of
oaks
across
which
at
intervals
deer
were
passing
nor
were
human
figures
wanting
to
give
life
and
interest
to
the
scene
adown
the
glade
came
two
keepers
of
the
forest
having
each
a
couple
of
buckhounds
with
them
in
leash
whose
baying
sounded
cheerily
amid
the
woods
nearer
the
castle
and
bending
their
way
towards
it
marched
a
party
of
falconers
with
their
birds
whose
skill
they
had
been
approving
upon
their
fists
their
jesses
ringing
as
they
moved
along
while
nearer
still
and
almost
at
the
foot
of
the
terrace
wall
was
a
minstrel
playing
on
a
rebec
to
which
a
keeper
in
a
dress
of
lincoln
green
with
a
bow
over
his
shoulder
a
quiver
of
arrows
at
his
back
and
a
comely
damsel
under
his
arm
was
listening
on
the
left
a
view
altogether
different
in
character
though
scarcely
less
beautiful
was
offered
to
the
gaze
it
was
formed
by
the
town
of
windsor
then
not
a
third
of
its
present
size
but
incomparably
more
picturesque
in
appearance
consisting
almost
entirely
of
a
long
straggling
row
of
houses
chequered
black
and
white
with
tall
gables
and
projecting
storeys
skirting
the
west
and
south
sides
of
the
castle
by
the
silver
windings
of
the
river
traceable
for
miles
and
reflecting
the
glowing
hues
of
the
sky
by
the
venerable
college
of
eton
embowered
in
a
grove
of
trees
and
by
a
vast
tract
of
and
country
beyond
it
interspersed
with
villages
churches
old
halls
monasteries
and
abbeys
taking
out
his
tablets
the
youth
after
some
reflection
traced
a
few
lines
upon
them
and
then
quitting
the
parapet
proceeded
slowly
and
with
a
musing
air
towards
the
north
west
angle
of
the
terrace
he
could
not
be
more
than
fifteen
perhaps
not
so
much
but
he
was
tall
and
with
slight
though
remarkably
limbs
and
it
might
have
been
safely
predicted
that
when
arrived
at
years
of
maturity
he
would
possess
great
personal
vigour
his
countenance
was
full
of
thought
and
intelligence
and
he
had
a
broad
lofty
brow
shaded
by
a
profusion
of
light
brown
ringlets
a
long
straight
and
nose
a
full
sensitive
and
mouth
and
a
pointed
chin
his
eyes
were
large
dark
and
somewhat
melancholy
in
expression
and
his
complexion
possessed
that
rich
clear
brown
tint
constantly
met
with
in
italy
or
spain
though
but
seldom
seen
in
a
native
of
our
own
colder
clime
his
dress
was
rich
but
sombre
consisting
of
a
doublet
of
black
satin
worked
with
threads
of
venetian
gold
hose
of
the
same
material
and
similarly
embroidered
a
shirt
curiously
wrought
with
black
silk
and
fastened
at
the
collar
with
black
enamelled
clasps
a
cloak
of
black
velvet
passmented
with
gold
and
lined
with
crimson
satin
a
flat
black
velvet
cap
set
with
pearls
and
goldsmith
work
and
adorned
with
a
short
white
plume
and
black
velvet
buskins
his
arms
were
rapier
and
dagger
both
having
gilt
and
graven
handles
and
sheaths
of
black
velvet
as
he
moved
along
the
sound
of
voices
chanting
vespers
arose
from
saint
george
chapel
and
while
he
paused
to
listen
to
the
solemn
strains
a
door
in
that
part
of
the
castle
used
as
the
king
privy
lodgings
opened
and
a
person
advanced
towards
him
the
had
broad
brown
features
darkened
still
more
by
a
thick
beard
clipped
short
in
the
fashion
of
the
time
and
a
pair
of
enormous
moustachios
he
was
accoutred
in
a
habergeon
which
gleamed
from
beneath
the
folds
of
a
mantle
and
wore
a
steel
cap
in
lieu
of
a
bonnet
on
his
head
while
a
long
sword
dangled
from
beneath
his
cloak
when
within
a
few
paces
of
the
youth
whose
back
was
towards
him
and
who
did
not
hear
his
approach
he
announced
himself
by
a
loud
cough
that
proved
the
excellence
of
his
lungs
and
made
the
old
walls
ring
again
startling
the
jackdaws
roosting
in
the
battlements
what
composing
a
vesper
hymn
my
lord
of
surrey
he
cried
with
a
laugh
as
the
other
hastily
thrust
the
tablets
which
he
had
hitherto
held
in
his
hand
into
his
bosom
you
will
rival
master
skelton
the
poet
laureate
and
your

thomas
wyat

ere

but

moment

bouchier
inquired
the
earl

a
significant
smile

my

the
other
smiling
in
his
turn

and

wolsey
pursued
the
other
the
captain
bowed
again
to
save
your
lordship
the
necessity
of
asking
any
further
questions
he
said
i
may
state
briefly
that
i
have
done
all
as

you
had
done

be
a
little
more
particular
captain
i
pray

and
acquainted
them

a
set

flatter
myself

quite
equal
to
any
that
your
lordship
with
all
your
poetical
talents
could
have
delivered
that

king
highness
being
at

captain

the
earl

bouchier

court
whenever
it
shall
please
you
to
set
and
that
will
not
be
for
an
hour
at
the
least
replied
the
earl
for
i
intend
to
take
a
solitary
ramble
in
the
home
what
i
to
seek
inspiration
for
a
song
or
to
meditate
upon
the
charms
of
the
fair
geraldine
eh
my
lord
rejoined
bouchier
but
i
will
not
question
you
too
shrewdly
only
let
me
caution
you
against
going
near
herne
oak
it
is
said
that
the
demon
hunter
walks
at
nightfall
and
scares
if
he
does
not
injure
all
those
who
cross
his
path
at
curfew
toll
i
must
quit
the
castle
and
will
then
with
your
attendants
proceed
to
the
garter
in
thames
street
where
i
will
await
your
arrival
if
we
reach
hampton
court
by
midnight
it
will
be
time
enough
and
as
the
moon
will
rise
in
an
hour
we
shall
have
a
pleasant
commend
me
to
bryan
bowntance
the
worthy
host
of
the
garter
said
the
earl
and
bid
him
provide
you
with
a
bottle
of
his
best
sack
in
which
to
drink
my
fear
me
not
replied
the
other
and
i
pray
your
lordship
not
to
neglect
my
caution
respecting
herne
the
hunter
in
sober
sooth
i
have
heard
strange
stories
of
his
appearance
of
late
and
should
not
care
to
go
near
the
tree
after
the
earl
laughed
somewhat
sceptically
and
the
captain
reiterating
his
caution
they
separated
bouchier
returning
the
way
he
came
and
surrey
proceeding
towards
a
small
drawbridge
crossing
the
ditch
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
castle
and
forming
a
means
of
communication
with
the
little
park
he
was
challenged
by
a
sentinel
at
the
drawbridge
but
on
giving
the
password
he
was
allowed
to
cross
it
and
to
pass
through
a
gate
on
the
farther
side
opening
upon
the
park
brushing
the
soft
and
dewy
turf
with
a
footstep
almost
as
light
and
bounding
as
that
of
a
fawn
he
speeded
on
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
he
reached
a
noble
standing
at
the
end
of
a
clump
of
timber
a
number
of
rabbits
were
feeding
beneath
it
but
at
his
approach
they
instantly
plunged
into
their
burrows
here
he
halted
to
look
at
the
castle
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
it
dilating
its
massive
keep
to
almost
its
present
height
and
tinging
the
summits
of
the
whole
line
of
ramparts
and
towers
since
rebuilt
and
known
as
the
brunswick
tower
the
chester
tower
the
clarence
tower
and
the
victoria
tower
with
rosy
lustre
flinging
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
the
youthful
earl
indulged
his
poetical
reveries
for
a
short
time
and
then
rising
retraced
his
steps
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
of
the
south
side
of
the
castle
lay
before
him
the
view
comprehended
the
two
fortifications
recently
removed
to
make
way
for
the
york
and
lancaster
towers
between
which
stood
a
gate
approached
by
a
drawbridge
the
earl
marshal
tower
now
styled
from
the
monarch
in
whose
reign
it
was
erected
edward
the
third
tower
the
black
rod
lodgings
the
lieutenant
now
henry
the
third
tower
the
line
of
embattled
walls
constituting
the
lodgings
of
the
the
tower
tenanted
by
the
governor
of
that
body
and
still
allotted
to
the
same
officer
henry
the
eight
gateway
and
the
chancellor
of
the
garter
tower
the
latter
terminating
the
line
of
building
a
few
rosy
beams
tipped
the
pinnacles
of
saint
chapel
seen
behind
the
towers
with
fire
but
with
this
exception
the
whole
of
the
mighty
fabric
looked
cold
and
grey
at
this
juncture
the
upper
gate
was
opened
and
captain
bouchier
and
his
attendants
issued
from
it
and
passed
over
the
drawbridge
the
curfew
bell
then
tolled
the
drawbridge
was
raised
the
horsemen
disappeared
and
no
sound
reached
the
listener
ear
except
the
measured
tread
of
the
sentinels
on
the
ramparts
audible
in
the
profound
stillness
the
youthful
earl
made
no
attempt
to
join
his
followers
but
having
gazed
on
the
ancient
pile
before
him
till
its
battlements
and
towers
grew
dim
in
the
twilight
he
struck
into
a
footpath
leading
across
the
park
towards
datchet
and
pursued
it
until
it
brought
him
near
a
dell
filled
with
thorns
hollies
and
underwood
and
overhung
by
mighty
oaks
into
which
he
unhesitatingly
plunged
and
soon
gained
the
deepest
part
of
it
here
owing
to
the
thickness
of
the
hollies
and
the
projecting
arms
of
other
large
overhanging
timber
added
to
the
uncertain
light
above
the
gloom
was
almost
impervious
and
he
could
scarcely
see
a
yard
before
him
still
he
pressed
on
unhesitatingly
and
with
a
sort
of
pleasurable
sensation
at
the
difficulties
he
was
encountering
suddenly
however
he
was
startled
by
a
blue
phosphoric
light
streaming
through
the
bushes
on
the
left
and
looking
up
he
beheld
at
the
foot
of
an
enormous
oak
whose
giant
roots
protruded
like
twisted
snakes
from
the
bank
a
wild
object
possessing
some
slight
resemblance
to
humanity
and
habited
so
far
as
it
could
be
determined
in
the
skins
of
deer
strangely
disposed
about
its
gaunt
and
limbs
on
its
head
was
seen
a
sort
of
helmet
formed
of
the
skull
of
a
stag
from
which
branched
a
large
pair
of
antlers
from
its
left
arm
hung
a
heavy
and
chain
in
the
links
of
which
burnt
the
phosphoric
fire
before
mentioned
while
on
its
right
wrist
was
perched
a
large
horned
owl
with
feathers
erected
and
red
staring
eyes
impressed
with
the
superstitious
feelings
common
to
the
age
the
young
earl
fully
believing
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
supernatural
being
could
scarcely
despite
his
courageous
nature
which
no
ordinary
matter
would
have
shaken
repress
a
cry
crossing
himself
he
repeated
with
great
fervency
a
prayer
against
evil
spirits
and
as
he
uttered
it
the
light
was
extinguished
and
the
spectral
figure
vanished
the
clanking
of
the
chain
was
heard
succeeded
by
the
hooting
of
the
owl
then
came
a
horrible
burst
of
laughter
then
a
fearful
wail
and
all
was
silent
up
to
this
moment
the
young
earl
had
stood
still
as
if
but
being
now
convinced
that
the
spirit
had
fled
he
pressed
forward
and
ere
many
seconds
emerged
from
the
brake
the
full
moon
was
rising
as
he
issued
forth
and
illuminating
the
glades
and
vistas
and
the
calmness
and
beauty
of
all
around
seemed
at
total
variance
with
the
fearful
vision
he
had
just
witnessed
throwing
a
shuddering
glance
at
the
haunted
dell
he
was
about
to
hurry
towards
the
castle
when
a
large
and
solitary
oak
standing
a
little
distance
from
him
attracted
his
attention
this
was
the
very
tree
connected
with
the
wild
legend
of
herne
the
hunter
which
captain
bouchier
had
warned
him
not
to
approach
and
he
now
forcibly
recalled
the
caution
beneath
it
he
perceived
a
figure
which
he
at
first
took
for
that
of
the
spectral
hunter
but
his
fears
were
relieved
by
a
shout
from
the
person
who
at
the
same
moment
appeared
to
catch
sight
of
him
satisfied
that
in
the
present
instance
he
had
to
do
with
a
being
of
this
world
surrey
ran
towards
the
tree
and
on
approaching
it
perceived
that
the
object
of
his
alarm
was
a
young
man
of
very
athletic
proportions
and
evidently
from
his
garb
a
keeper
of
the
forest
he
was
habited
in
a
jerkin
of
lincoln
green
cloth
with
the
royal
badge
woven
in
silver
on
the
breast
and
his
head
was
protected
by
a
flat
green
cloth
cap
ornamented
with
a
pheasant
tail
under
his
right
arm
he
carried
a
crossbow
a
long
horn
was
slung
in
his
baldric
and
he
was
armed
with
a
short
hanger
or
his
features
were
harsh
and
prominent
and
he
had
black
beetling
brows
a
large
coarse
mouth
and
dark
eyes
lighted
up
with
a
very
sinister
and
malignant
expression
he
was
attended
by
a
large
staghound
whom
he
addressed
as
bawsey
and
whose
fierceness
had
to
be
restrained
as
surrey
approached
have
you
seen
anything
he
demanded
of
the
earl
i
have
seen
herne
the
hunter
himself
or
the
fiend
in
his
likeness
replied
surrey
and
he
briefly
related
the
vision
he
had
beheld
ay
ay
you
have
seen
the
demon
hunter
no
doubt
replied
the
keeper
at
the
close
of
the
recital
i
neither
saw
the
light
nor
heard
the
laughter
nor
the
wailing
cry
you
speak
of
but
bawsey
crouched
at
my
feet
and
whined
and
i
knew
some
evil
thing
was
at
hand
heaven
shield
us
he
exclaimed
as
the
hound
crouched
at
his
feet
and
directed
her
gaze
towards
the
oak
uttering
a
low
ominous
whine
she
is
at
the
same
trick
the
earl
glanced
in
the
same
direction
and
half
expected
to
see
the
knotted
trunk
of
the
tree
burst
open
and
disclose
the
figure
of
the
spectral
hunter
but
nothing
was
visible
at
least
to
him
though
it
would
seem
from
the
shaking
limbs
fixed
eyes
and
ghastly
visage
of
the
keeper
that
some
appalling
object
was
presented
to
his
gaze
do
you
not
see
him
cried
the
latter
at
length
in
thrilling
accents
he
is
circling
the
tree
and
blasting
it
there
he
passes
us
now
do
you
not
see
him
no
replied
surrey
but
do
not
let
us
tarry
here
so
saying
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
keeper
arm
the
touch
seemed
to
rouse
him
to
exertion
he
uttered
a
fearful
cry
and
set
off
at
a
quick
pace
along
the
park
followed
by
bawsey
with
her
tail
between
her
legs
the
earl
kept
up
with
him
and
neither
halted
till
they
had
left
the
wizard
oak
at
a
considerable
distance
behind
them
and
so
you
did
not
see
him
said
the
keeper
in
a
tone
of
exhaustion
as
he
wiped
the
thick
drops
from
his
brow
i
did
not
replied
surrey
that
is
passing
strange
rejoined
the
other
i
myself
have
seen
him
before
but
never
as
he
appeared
you
are
a
keeper
of
the
forest
i
presume
friend
said
surrey
how
are
you
named
i
am
called
morgan
fenwolf
replied
the
keeper
and
you
i
am
the
earl
of
surrey
returned
the
young
noble
what
exclaimed
fenwolf
making
a
reverence
the
son
to
his
grace
of
norfolk
the
earl
replied
in
the
affirmative
why
then
you
must
be
the
young
nobleman
whom
i
used
to
see
so
often
with
the
king
son
the
duke
of
richmond
three
or
four
years
ago
at
the
castle
rejoined
fenwolf
you
are
altogether
grown
out
of
my
not
unlikely
returned
the
earl
i
have
been
at
oxford
and
have
only
just
completed
my
studies
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
at
windsor
since
the
period
you
i
have
heard
that
the
duke
of
richmond
was
at
oxford
likewise
observed
fenwolf
we
were
at
cardinal
college
together
replied
surrey
but
the
term
was
completed
before
mine
he
is
my
senior
by
three
i
suppose
your
lordship
is
returning
to
the
castle
said
fenwolf
no
replied
surrey
my
attendants
are
waiting
for
me
at
the
garter
and
if
you
will
accompany
me
thither
i
will
bestow
a
cup
of
good
ale
upon
you
to
recruit
you
after
the
fright
you
have
fenwolf
signified
his
graceful
acquiescence
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
the
earl
could
not
help
dwelling
upon
the
vision
he
had
witnessed
and
his
companion
appeared
equally
abstracted
in
this
sort
they
descended
the
hill
near
henry
the
eighth
gate
and
entered
thames
street
ii
of
bryan
bowntance
the
host
of
the
garter
of
the
duke
of
shoreditch
of
the
bold
words
uttered
by
mark
fytton
the
butcher
and
how
he
was
cast
into
the
vault
of
the
curfew
tower
turning
off
on
the
right
the
earl
and
his
companion
continued
to
descend
the
hill
until
they
came
in
sight
of
the
garter
a
snug
little
hostel
situated
immediately
beneath
the
curfew
tower
before
the
porch
were
grouped
the
earl
attendants
most
of
whom
had
dismounted
and
were
holding
their
steeds
by
the
bridles
at
this
juncture
the
door
of
the
hostel
opened
and
a
fat
personage
with
a
bald
head
and
bushy
grey
beard
and
clad
in
a
brown
serge
doublet
and
hose
to
match
issued
forth
bearing
a
foaming
jug
of
ale
and
a
horn
cup
his
appearance
was
welcomed
by
a
joyful
shout
from
the
attendants
come
my
masters
he
cried
filling
the
horn
here
is
a
cup
of
stout
windsor
ale
in
which
to
drink
the
health
of
our
jolly
monarch
bluff
king
hal
and
there
no
harm
i
trust
in
calling
him
marry
is
there
not
mine
host
cried
the
foremost
attendant
i
spoke
of
him
as
such
in
his
own
hearing
not
long
ago
and
he
laughed
at
me
in
right
merry
sort
i
love
the
royal
bully
and
will
drink
his
health
gladly
and
mistress
anne
boleyn
to
and
he
emptied
the
horn
they
tell
me
mistress
anne
boleyn
is
coming
to
windsor
with
the
king
and
the
is
it
so
asked
the
host
again
filling
the
horn
and
handing
it
to
another
attendant
the
person
addressed
nodded
but
he
was
too
much
engrossed
by
the
horn
to
speak
then
there
will
be
rare
doings
in
the
castle
chuckled
the
host
and
many
a
lusty
pot
will
be
drained
at
the
garter
how
times
are
changed
since
i
bryan
bowntance
first
stepped
into
my
shoes
and
became
host
of
the
garter
it
was
in
years
ago
when
king
henry
the
seventh
of
blessed
memory
ruled
the
land
and
when
his
elder
son
prince
arthur
was
alive
likewise
in
that
year
the
young
prince
espoused
catherine
of
arragon
our
present
queen
and
soon
afterwards
died
whereupon
the
old
king
not
liking
for
he
loved
his
treasure
better
than
his
own
flesh
to
part
with
her
dowry
gave
her
to
his
second
son
henry
our
gracious
sovereign
whom
god
preserve
folks
said
then
the
match
would
come
to
good
and
now
we
find
they
spoke
the
truth
for
it
is
likely
to
end
in
a
not
so
loud
mine
host
cried
the
foremost
attendant
here
comes
our
young
master
the
earl
of
well
i
care
not
replied
the
host
bluffly
i
spoken
no
treason
i
love
my
king
and
if
he
wishes
to
have
a
divorce
i
hope
his
holiness
the
pope
will
grant
him
one
that
as
he
said
this
a
loud
noise
was
heard
within
the
hostel
and
a
man
was
suddenly
and
so
forcibly
driven
forth
that
he
almost
knocked
down
bryan
bowntance
who
was
rushing
in
to
see
what
was
the
matter
the
person
thus
ejected
who
was
a
young
man
in
a
leathern
doublet
with
his
muscular
arms
bared
to
the
shoulder
turned
his
rage
upon
the
host
and
seized
him
by
the
throat
with
a
grip
that
threatened
him
with
strangulation
indeed
but
for
the
intervention
of
the
attendants
who
rushed
to
his
assistance
such
might
have
been
his
fate
as
soon
as
he
was
liberated
bryan
cried
in
a
voice
of
mingled
rage
and
surprise
to
his
assailant
why
what
the
matter
mark
fytton
are
you
gone
mad
or
do
you
mistake
me
for
a
sheep
or
a
bullock
that
you
attack
me
in
this
fashion
my
strong
ale
must
have
got
into
your
addle
pate
with
a
vengeance
the
knave
has
been
speaking
treason
of
the
king
highness
said
the
tall
man
whose
doublet
and
hose
of
the
finest
green
cloth
as
well
as
the
how
and
quiverful
of
arrows
at
his
back
proclaimed
him
an
archer
and
therefore
we
turned
him
out
and
you
did
well
captain
barlow
cried
the
host
call
me
rather
the
duke
of
shoreditch
rejoined
the
tall
archer
for
since
his
majesty
conferred
the
title
upon
me
though
it
were
but
in
jest
when
i
won
this
silver
bugle
i
shall
ever
claim
it
i
am
always
designated
by
my
neighbours
in
shoreditch
as
his
grace
and
i
require
the
same
attention
at
your
hands
i
shall
have
my
comrades
the
marquises
of
clerkenwell
islington
hogsden
pancras
and
paddington
with
me
and
then
you
will
see
the
gallant
figure
we
shall
i
crave
your
grace
pardon
for
my
want
of
respect
replied
the
host
i
am
not
ignorant
of
the
distinction
conferred
upon
you
at
the
last
match
at
the
castle
butts
by
the
king
but
to
the
matter
in
hand
what
treason
hath
mark
fytton
the
butcher
been
talking
i
care
not
to
repeat
his
words
mine
host
replied
the
duke
but
he
hath
spoken
in
unbecoming
terms
of
his
highness
and
mistress
anne
he
means
not
what
he
says
rejoined
the
host
he
is
a
loyal
subject
of
the
king
but
he
is
apt
to
get
quarrelsome
over
his
well
said
honest
bryan
cried
the
duke
you
have
one
quality
of
a
good
landlord
that
of
a
peacemaker
give
the
knave
a
cup
of
ale
and
let
him
wash
down
his
foul
words
in
a
health
to
the
king
wishing
him
a
speedy
divorce
and
a
new
queen
and
he
shall
then
sit
among
us
i
do
not
desire
to
sit
with
you
you
duke
rejoined
mark
but
if
you
will
doff
your
fine
jerkin
and
stand
up
with
me
on
the
green
i
will
give
you
cause
to
remember
laying
hands
on
well
challenged
bold
butcher
cried
one
of
surrey
attendants
you
shall
be
made
a
duke
or
a
cardinal
cried
mark
i
should
not
be
the
first
of
my
brethren
who
has
met
with
such
he
derides
the
church
in
the
person
of
cardinal
wolsey
cried
the
duke
he
is
a
blasphemer
as
well
as
drink
the
king
health
in
a
full
cup
mark
interposed
the
host
anxious
to
set
matters
aright
and
keep
your
mischievous
tongue
between
your
beshrew
me
if
i
drink
the
king
health
or
that
of
his
minion
anne
boleyn
cried
mark
boldly
but
i
will
tell
you
what
i
will
drink
i
will
drink
the
health
of
king
henry
lawful
consort
catherine
of
arragon
and
i
will
add
to
it
a
wish
that
the
pope
may
forge
her
marriage
chains
to
her
royal
husband
faster
than
a
foolish
wish
cried
bryan
why
mark
you
are
clean
crazed
it
is
the
king
who
is
crazed
not
me
cried
mark
he
would
sacrifice
his
rightful
consort
to
his
unlawful
passion
and
you
base
hirelings
support
the
tyrant
in
his
wrongful
conduct
saints
protect
us
exclaimed
bryan
why
this
is
flat
treason
mark
i
can
no
longer
uphold
not
if
you
do
not
desire
to
share
his
prison
mine
host
cried
the
duke
of
shoreditch
you
have
all
heard
him
call
the
king
a
tyrant
seize
him
my
masters
let
them
lay
hands
upon
me
if
they
dare
cried
the
butcher
resolutely
i
have
felled
an
ox
with
a
blow
of
my
fist
before
this
and
i
promise
you
i
will
show
them
no
better
awed
by
mark
determined
manner
the
bystanders
kept
aloof
i
command
you
in
the
king
name
to
seize
him
roared
shoreditch
if
he
offers
resistance
he
will
assuredly
be
no
one
shall
touch
me
cried
mark
fiercely
that
remains
to
be
seen
said
the
foremost
of
the
earl
of
attendants
yield
fellow
never
replied
mark
and
i
warn
you
to
keep
the
attendant
however
advanced
but
before
he
could
lay
hands
on
the
butcher
he
received
a
blow
from
his
fist
that
sent
him
reeling
backwards
for
several
paces
and
finally
stretched
him
at
full
length
upon
the
ground
his
companions
drew
their
swords
and
would
have
instantly
fallen
upon
the
sturdy
offender
if
morgan
fenwolf
who
with
the
earl
of
surrey
was
standing
among
the
spectators
had
not
rushed
forward
and
closing
with
mark
before
the
latter
could
strike
a
blow
grappled
with
him
and
held
him
fast
till
he
was
secured
and
his
arms
tied
behind
him
and
so
it
is
you
morgan
fenwolf
who
have
served
me
this
ill
turn
eh
cried
the
butcher
regarding
him
fiercely
i
now
believe
all
i
have
heard
of
what
have
you
heard
of
him
asked
surrey
advancing
that
he
has
dealings
with
the
fiend
with
herne
the
hunter
replied
mark
if
i
am
hanged
for
a
traitor
he
ought
to
be
burnt
for
a
heed
not
what
the
villain
says
my
good
fellow
said
the
duke
of
shoreditch
you
have
captured
him
bravely
and
i
will
take
care
your
conduct
is
duly
reported
to
his
majesty
to
the
castle
with
him
to
the
castle
he
will
lodge
in
the
deepest
dungeon
of
yon
fortification
pointing
to
the
curfew
tower
above
them
there
to
await
the
king
judgment
and
night
it
will
be
well
for
him
if
he
is
not
swinging
from
the
gibbet
near
the
bridge
bring
him
and
followed
by
morgan
fenwolf
and
the
others
with
the
prisoner
he
strode
up
the
hill
long
before
this
captain
bouchier
had
issued
from
the
hostel
and
joined
the
earl
and
they
walked
together
after
the
crowd
in
a
few
minutes
the
duke
of
shoreditch
reached
henry
the
eighth
gate
where
he
shouted
to
a
sentinel
and
told
him
what
had
occurred
after
some
delay
a
wicket
in
the
gate
was
opened
and
the
chief
persons
of
the
party
were
allowed
to
pass
through
it
with
the
prisoner
who
was
assigned
to
the
custody
of
a
couple
of
arquebusiers
by
this
time
an
officer
had
arrived
and
it
was
agreed
at
the
suggestion
of
the
duke
of
shoreditch
to
take
the
offender
to
the
curfew
tower
accordingly
they
crossed
the
lower
ward
and
passing
beneath
an
archway
near
the
semicircular
range
of
habitations
allotted
to
the
petty
canons
traversed
the
space
before
the
west
end
of
saint
chapel
and
descending
a
short
flight
of
stone
steps
at
the
left
and
threading
a
narrow
passage
presently
arrived
at
the
arched
entrance
in
the
curfew
whose
hoary
walls
shone
brightly
in
the
moonlight
they
had
to
knock
for
some
time
against
the
stout
oak
door
before
any
notice
was
taken
of
the
summons
at
length
an
old
man
who
acted
as
bellringer
thrust
his
head
out
of
one
of
the
narrow
pointed
windows
above
and
demanded
their
business
satisfied
with
the
reply
he
descended
and
opening
the
door
admitted
them
into
a
lofty
chamber
the
roof
of
which
was
composed
of
stout
planks
crossed
by
heavy
oaken
rafters
and
supported
by
beams
of
the
same
material
on
the
left
a
steep
flight
of
wooden
steps
led
to
an
upper
room
and
from
a
hole
in
the
roof
descended
a
which
was
fastened
to
one
of
the
beams
showing
the
use
to
which
the
chamber
was
put
some
further
consultation
was
now
held
among
the
party
as
to
the
propriety
of
leaving
the
prisoner
in
this
chamber
under
the
guard
of
the
arquebusiers
but
it
was
at
last
decided
against
doing
so
and
the
old
bellringer
being
called
upon
for
the
keys
of
the
dungeon
beneath
he
speedily
produced
them
they
then
went
forth
and
descending
a
flight
of
stone
steps
on
the
left
came
to
a
low
strong
door
which
they
unlocked
and
obtained
admission
to
a
large
octangular
chamber
with
a
vaulted
roof
and
deep
embrasures
terminated
by
narrow
loopholes
the
light
of
a
lamp
carried
by
the
bellringer
showed
the
dreary
extent
of
the
vault
and
the
enormous
thickness
of
its
walls
a
night
solitary
confinement
in
this
place
will
be
of
infinite
service
to
our
prisoner
said
the
duke
of
shoreditch
gazing
around
i
be
sworn
he
is
ready
to
bite
off
the
foolish
tongue
that
has
brought
him
to
such
a
the
butcher
made
no
reply
but
being
released
by
the
arquebusiers
sat
down
upon
a
bench
that
constituted
the
sole
furniture
of
the
vault
shall
i
leave
him
the
lamp
asked
the
bellringer
he
may
beguile
the
time
by
reading
the
names
of
former
prisoners
scratched
on
the
walls
and
in
the
no
he
shall
not
even
have
that
miserable
satisfaction
returned
the
duke
of
shoreditch
he
shall
be
left
in
the
darkness
to
his
own
bad
and
bitter
with
this
the
party
withdrew
and
the
door
was
fastened
upon
the
prisoner
an
arquebusier
was
stationed
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
the
earl
of
surrey
and
captain
bouchier
having
fully
satisfied
their
curiosity
shaped
their
course
towards
the
castle
gate
on
their
way
thither
the
earl
looked
about
for
morgan
fenwolf
but
could
nowhere
discern
him
he
then
passed
through
the
wicket
with
bouchier
and
proceeding
to
the
garter
they
mounted
their
steeds
and
galloped
off
towards
datchet

a
joyous

were
the
preparations
made
by
its
loyal
inhabitants
for
a
suitable
reception
to
their
sovereign
at
an
early
hour
the
town
was
thronged
with
strangers
from
the
neighbouring
villages
and
later
on
crowds
began
to
arrive
from
london
some
having
come
along
the
highway
on
horseback
and
others
having
rowed
in
various
craft
up
the
river
all
were
clad
in
holiday
attire
and
the
streets
presented
an
appearance
of
unwonted
bustle
and
gaiety
the
maypole
in
bachelors
acre
was
hung
with
flowers
several
booths
with
flags
floating
above
them
were
erected
in
the
same
place
where
ale
mead
and
hypocras
together
with
cold
pasties
hams
capons
and
large
joints
of
beef
and
mutton
might
be
obtained
mummers
and
minstrels
were
in
attendance
and
every
kind
of
diversion
was
going
forward
here

one
party
wrestling
there
another
casting
the

on
this
side
a
set
of
rustics
were
dancing
a
merry
round
with
a
bevy
of
buxom
berkshire

on
that
stood
a
fourth
group
listening
to
a
youth
playing
on
the
recorders
at

end
of
the
acre
large
fires
were
lighted
before
which
two
whole
oxen
were
roasting
provided
in

of
the
occasion
by
the
mayor
and
burgesses
of
the
town

set
against
which
the
duke
of
shoreditch
and
his
companions
the
five
marquises
were
practising
the
duke
himself
shot
admirably
and
never
failed
to
hit
the
but
the
great
feat
of
the
day
was
performed
by
morgan
fenwolf
who
thrice
split
the
duke
shafts
as
they
stuck
in
the
mark
well
done
cried
the
duke
as
he
witnessed
the
achievement
why
you
shoot
as
bravely
as
herne
the
hunter
old
wives
tell
us
he
used
to
split
the
arrows
of
his
comrades
in
that
he
must
have
learnt
the
trick
from
herne
himself
in
the
forest
cried
one
of
the
bystanders
morgan
fenwolf
looked
fiercely
round
in
search
of
the
speaker
but
could
not
discern
him
he
however
shot
no
more
and
refusing
a
cup
of
hypocras
offered
him
by
shoreditch
disappeared
among
the
crowd
soon
after
this
the
booths
were
emptied
the
bar
thrown
down
the
maypole
and
the
butts
deserted
and
the
whole
of
bachelors
acre
cleared
of
its
occupants
except
those
who
were
compelled
to
attend
to
the
mighty
spits
turning
before
the
fires
by
the
loud
discharge
of
ordnance
from
the
castle
gates
accompanied
by
the
ringing
of
bells
announcing

promptly
obeyed

summons
beheld

open
while
from
it
issued
four
trumpeters

without

with
the

of

wrought
in

then
the
twelve

lastly
the

in
a

of
crimson
satin
paned
and
emblazoned
like

of
the
officer
who
preceded
him

followed
by

grave
personage
in
a
black

covered
by
a

and
adorned
with
cordons
of

mingled

brought
up
by
a
rear
guard
of
halberdiers
the
procession
moved
slowly
along
thames
street
the
houses
of
which
as
well
as
those
in
peascod
street
were
all
more
or
less
decorated
the
humbler
sort
being
covered
with
branches
of
trees
intermingled
with
garlands
of
flowers
while
the
better
description
was
hung
with
pieces
of
tapestry
carpets
and
rich
stuffs
nor
should
it
pass
unnoticed
that
the
loyalty
of
bryan
bowntance
the
host
of
the
garter
had
exhibited
itself
in
an
arch
thrown
across
the
road
opposite
his
house
adorned
with
various
coloured
ribbons
and
flowers
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
large
shield
exhibiting
the
letters
and
in
mystic
allusion
to
henry
and
anne
boleyn
intermingled
and
surrounded
by
turning
off
on
the
left
into
the
lower
road
skirting
the
north
of
the
castle
and
following
the
course
of
the
river
to
datchet
by
which
it
was
understood
the
royal
cavalcade
would
make
its
approach
the
procession
arrived
at
an
open
space
by
the
side
of
the
river
where
it
came
to
a
halt
and
the
dean
chancellor
and
prelate
together
with
other
officers
of
the
garter
embarked
in
a
barge
moored
to
the
bank
which
was
towed
slowly
down
the
stream
in
the
direction
of
datchet
bridge
a
band
of
minstrels
stationed
within
it
playing
all
the
time
meanwhile
the
rest
of
the
cavalcade
having
again
set
for
ward
pursued
their
course
along
the
banks
of
the
river
proceeding
at
a
foot
pace
and
accompanied
by
crowds
of
spectators
cheering
them
as
they
moved
along
the
day
was
bright
and
beautiful
and
nothing
was
wanting
to
enhance
the
beauty
of
the
spectacle
on
the
left
flowed
the
silver
thames
crowded
with
craft
filled
with
personages
of
both
sexes
amid
which
floated
the
pompous
barge
appropriated
to
the
officers
of
the
garter
which
was
hung
with
banners
and
streamers
and
decorated
at
the
sides
with
targets
emblazoned
with
the
arms
of
george
on
the
greensward
edging
the
stream
marched
a
brilliant
cavalcade
and
on
the
right
lay
the
old
woods
of
the
home
park
with
long
vistas
opening
through
them
giving
exquisite
peeps
of
the
towers
and
battlements
of
the
castle
half
an
hour
brought
the
cavalcade
to
datchet
bridge
at
the
foot
of
which
a
pavilion
was
erected
for
the
accommodation
of
the
mayor
and
burgesses
and
here
having
dismounted
they
awaited
the
king
arrival
shortly
after
this
a
cloud
of
dust
on
the
staines
road
seemed
to
announce
the
approach
of
the
royal
party
and
all
rushed
forth
and
held
themselves
in
readiness
to
meet
it
but
the
dust
appeared
to
have
been
raised
by
a
company
of
horsemen
headed
by
captain
bouchier
who
rode
up
the
next
moment
courteously
saluting
the
mayor
bouchier
informed
him
that
mistress
anne
boleyn
was
close
behind
and
that
it
was
the
pleasure
that
she
should
be
attended
in
all
state
to
the
lower
gate
of
the
castle
there
to
await
his
coming
as
he
himself
intended
to
enter
it
with
her
the
mayor
replied
that
the
sovereign
behests
should
be
implicitly
obeyed
and
he
thereupon
stationed
himself
at
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
in
expectation
of
anne
boleyn
arrival
presently
the
sound
of
trumpets
smote
his
ear
and
a
numerous
and
splendid
retinue
was
seen
advancing
consisting
of
nobles
knights
esquires
and
gentlemen
ranged
according
to
their
degrees
and
all
sumptuously
apparelled
in
cloths
of
gold
and
silver
and
velvets
of
various
colours
richly
embroidered
besides
these
there
were
pages
and
other
attendants
in
the
liveries
of
their
masters
together
with
sergeants
of
the
guard
and
henchmen
in
their
full
accoutrements
among
the
nobles
were
the
dukes
of
norfolk
and
suffolk
the
king
being
desirous
of
honouring
as
much
as
possible
her
whom
he
had
resolved
to
make
his
queen
the
former
was
clothed
in
tissue
embroidered
with
roses
of
gold
with
a
baldric
across
his
body
of
massive
gold
and
was
mounted
on
a
charger
likewise
trapped
in
gold
and
the
latter
wore
a
mantle
of
cloth
of
silver
pounced
in
the
form
of
letters
and
lined
with
blue
velvet
while
his
horse
was
trapped
hardwise
in
harness
embroidered
with
bullion
gold
curiously
wrought
both
also
wore
the
collar
of
the
order
of
the
garter
near
them
rode
sir
thomas
boleyn
who
conscious
of
the
dignity
to
which
his
daughter
was
to
be
advanced
comported
himself
with
almost
intolerable
haughtiness
immediately
behind
sir
thomas
boleyn
came
a
sumptuous
litter
covered
with
cloth
of
gold
drawn
by
four
white
palfreys
caparisoned
in
white
damask
down
to
the
ground
and
each
having
a
page
in
white
and
blue
satin
at
its
head
over
the
litter
was
borne
a
canopy
of
cloth
of
gold
supported
by
four
gilt
staves
and
ornamented
at
the
corners
with
silver
bells
ringing
forth
sweet
music
as
it
moved
along
each
staff
was
borne
by
a
knight
of
whom
sixteen
were
in
attendance
to
relieve
one
another
when
fatigued
in
this
litter
sat
anne
boleyn
she
wore
a
surcoat
of
white
tissue
and
a
mantle
of
the
same
material
lined
with
ermine
her
gown
which
however
was
now
concealed
by
the
surcoat
was
of
cloth
of
gold
tissue
raised
with
pearls
of
silver
damask
with
a
stomacher
of
purple
gold
similarly
raised
and
large
open
sleeves
lined
with
chequered
tissue
around
her
neck
she
wore
a
chain
of
orient
pearls
from
which
depended
a
diamond
cross
a
black
velvet
cap
richly
embroidered
with
pearls
and
other
precious
stones
and
ornamented
with
a
small
white
plume
covered
her
head
and
her
small
feet
were
hidden
in
blue
velvet
brodequins
decorated
with
diamond
stars
anne
boleyn
features
were
exquisitely
formed
and
though
not
regular
far
more
charming
than
if
they
had
been
so
her
nose
was
slightly
aquiline
but
not
enough
so
to
detract
from
its
beauty
and
had
a
little
retrousse
point
that
completed
its
attraction
the
rest
of
her
features
were
delicately
chiselled
the
chin
being
beautifully
rounded
the
brow
smooth
and
white
as
snow
while
the
rose
could
not
vie
with
the
bloom
of
her
cheek
her
neck
alas
that
the
fell
hand
of
the
executioner
should
ever
touch
it
was
long
and
slender
her
eyes
large
and
blue
and
of
irresistible
witchery
sometimes
scorching
the
beholder
like
a
sunbeam
anon
melting
him
with
softness
of
her
accomplishments
other
opportunities
will
be
found
to
speak
but
it
may
be
mentioned
that
she
was
skilled
on
many
instruments
danced
and
sang
divinely
and
had
rare
powers
of
conversation
and
wit
if
to
these
she
had
not
added
the
dangerous
desire
to
please
and
the
wish
to
hold
other
hearts
than
the
royal
one
she
had
enslaved
in
thraldom
all
might
perhaps
have
been
well
but
alas
like
many
other
beautiful
women
she
had
a
strong
tendency
to
coquetry
how
severely
she
suffered
for
it
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
history
to
relate
an
excellent
description
of
her
has
been
given
by
a
contemporary
writer
the
comte
de
chateaubriand
who
while
somewhat
disparaging
her
personal
attractions
speaks
in
rapturous
terms
of
her
accomplishments
anne
writes
the
comte
avait
un
esprit

such
was
the
opinion
of
one
who
knew
her
well
during
her
residence
at
the
french
court
when
in
attendance
on
mary
of
england
consort
of
louis
and
afterwards
duchess
of
suffolk
at
this
moment
anne
eyes
were
fixed
with
some
tenderness
upon
one
of
the
supporters
of
her
canopy
on
the
right
a
very
handsome
young
man
attired
in
a
doublet
and
hose
of
black
tylsent
paned
and
cut
and
whose
tall
figure
was
seen
to
the
greatest
advantage
inasmuch
as
he
had
divested
himself
of
his
mantle
for
his
better
convenience
in
walking
i
fear
me
you
will
fatigue
yourself
sir
thomas
wyat
said
anne
boleyn
in
tones
of
musical
sweetness
which
made
the
heart
beat
and
the
colour
mount
to
the
cheeks
of
him
she
addressed
you
had
better
allow
sir
thomas
arundel
or
sir
john
hulstone
to
relieve
i
can
feel
no
fatigue
when
near
you
madam
replied
wyat
in
a
low
tone
a
slight
blush
overspread
anne
features
and
she
raised
her
embroidered
kerchief
to
her
lips
if
i
had
that
kerchief
i
would
wear
it
at
the
next
lists
and
defy
all
comers
said
wyat
you
shall
have
it
then
rejoined
anne
i
love
all
chivalrous
exploits
and
will
do
my
best
to
encourage
take
heed
sir
thomas
said
sir
francis
weston
the
knight
who
held
the
staff
on
the
other
side
or
we
shall
have
the
canopy
down
let
sir
thomas
arundel
relieve
no
rejoined
wyat
recovering
himself
i
will
not
rest
till
we
come
to
the
you
are
in
no
haste
to
possess
the
kerchief
said
anne
petulantly
there
you
wrong
me
madam
cried
sir
thomas
eagerly
what
ho
good
fellows
he
shouted
to
the
attendants
at
the
heads
your
lady
desires
you
to
and
i
desire
them
to
go
on
i
will
sommers
jester
to
the
high
and
mighty
king
harry
the
eighth
cried
a
voice
of
mock
authority
behind
the
knight
what
if
sir
thomas
wyat
has
undertaken
to
carry
the
canopy
farther
than
any
of
his
companions
is
that
a
reason
he
should
be
relieved
of
a
surety
not
go
on
i
say
the
person
who
thus
spoke
then
stepped
forward
and
threw
a
glance
so
full
of
significance
at
anne
boleyn
that
she
did
not
care
to
dispute
the
order
but
on
the
contrary
laughingly
acquiesced
in
it
will
sommers
the
king
jester
as
he
described
himself
was
a
small
personage
with
a
physiognomy
in
which
good
nature
and
malice
folly
and
shrewdness
were
so
oddly
blended
that
it
was
difficult
to
say
which
predominated
his
look
was
cunning
and
sarcastic
but
it
was
tempered
by
great
drollery
and
oddity
of
manner
and
he
laughed
so
heartily
at
his
own
jests
and
jibes
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
help
joining
him
his
attire
consisted
of
a
long
loose
gown
of
spotted
crimson
silk
with
the
royal
cipher
woven
in
front
in
gold
hose
of
blue
cloth
guarded
with
red
and
black
cloth
and
red
cordovan
buskins
a
sash
tied
round
his
waist
served
him
instead
of
a
girdle
and
he
wore
a
velvet
cap
on
his
head
with
a
white
tufted
feather
in
it
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
small
horn
he
was
generally
attended
by
a
monkey
habited
in
a
crimson
doublet
and
hood
which
sat
upon
his
shoulder
and
played
very
diverting
tricks
but
the
animal
was
not
with
him
on
the
present
occasion
will
sommers
was
a
great
favourite
with
the
king
and
ventured
upon
familiarities
which
no
one
else
dared
to
use
with
him
the
favour
in
which
he
stood
with
his
royal
master
procured
him
admittance
to
his
presence
at
all
hours
and
at
all
seasons
and
his
influence
though
seldom
exerted
was
very
great
he
was
especially
serviceable
in
turning
aside
the
edge
of
the
king
displeasure
and
more
frequently
exerted
himself
to
allay
the
storm
than
to
raise
it
his
principal
hostility
was
directed
against
wolsey
whose
arrogance
and
grasping
practices
were
the
constant
subjects
of
his
railing
it
was
seldom
such
was
his
privileged
character
and
the
protection
he
enjoyed
from
the
sovereign
that
any
of
the
courtiers
resented
his
remarks
but
sir
thomas
wyat
feelings
being
now
deeply
interested
he
turned
sharply
round
and
said
how
now
thou
meddling
varlet
what
business
hast
thou
to
interfere
i
interfere
to
prove
my
authority
gossip
wyat
replied
sommers
and
to
show
that
varlet
as
i
am
i
am
as
powerful
as
mistress
anne
boleyn
nay
that
i
am
yet
more
powerful
because
i
am
obeyed
while
she
is
were
i
at
liberty
said
sir
thomas
angrily
i
would
make
thee
repent
thine
but
thou
art
not
at
liberty
good
gossip
replied
the
jester
screaming
with
laughter
thou
art
tied
like
a
slave
to
the
oar
and
can
not
free
thyself
from
it
ha
ha
having
enjoyed
the
discomposure
for
a
few
seconds
he
advanced
towards
him
and
whispered
in
his
ear
do
mistake
me
gossip
i
have
done
thee
good
service
in
preventing
thee
from
taking
that
kerchief
hadst
thou
received
it
in
the
presence
of
these
witnesses
thou
wouldst
have
been
lodged
in
the
round
tower
of
windsor
castle
instead
of
feasting
with
the
in
saint
george
i
believe
thou
art
right
gossip
said
wyat
in
the
same
tone
rest
assured
i
am
replied
sommers
and
i
further
more
counsel
thee
to
decline
this
dangerous
gift
altogether
and
to
think
no
more
of
the
fair
profferer
or
if
thou
must
think
of
her
let
it
be
as
of
one
beyond
thy
reach
cross
not
the
lion
path
take
a
friendly
hint
from
the
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
darted
away
and
mingled
with
the
cavalcade
in
the
rear
immediately
behind
anne
boleyn
litter
rode
a
company
of
henchmen
of
the
royal
household
armed
with
gilt
partisans
next
succeeded
a
chariot
covered
with
red
cloth
of
gold
and
drawn
by
four
horses
richly
caparisoned
containing
the
old
duchess
of
norfolk
and
the
old
marchioness
of
dorset
then
came
the
king
natural
son
the
duke
of
richmond
a
young
man
formed
on
the
same
large
scale
and
distinguished
by
the
same
haughty
port
and
the
same
bluff
manner
as
his
royal
sire
the
duke
mother
was
the
lady
talboys
esteemed
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
of
the
age
and
who
had
for
a
long
time
held
the
capricious
monarch
captive
henry
was
warmly
attached
to
his
son
showered
favours
without
number
upon
him
and
might
have
done
yet
more
if
fate
had
not
snatched
him
away
at
an
early
age
though
scarcely
eighteen
the
duke
of
richmond
looked
more
than
twenty
and
his
lips
and
chin
were
clothed
with
a
though
beard
he
was
magnificently
habited
in
a
doublet
of
cloth
of
gold
of
bawdekin
the
placard
and
sleeves
of
which
were
wrought
with
flat
gold
and
fastened
with
aiglets
a
girdle
of
crimson
velvet
enriched
with
precious
stones
encircled
his
waist
and
sustained
a
poniard
and
a
toledo
sword
damascened
with
gold
over
all
he
wore
a
loose
robe
or
housse
of
scarlet
mohair
trimmed
with
minever
and
was
further
decorated
with
the
collar
of
the
order
of
the
garter

cap
was
of
white
velvet
ornamented
with
emeralds
and
from
the
side
depended
a
small
azure

rode
a
magnificent
black
charger
trapped
in
housings
of

of
gold
powdered
with
ermine
by
the

the
earl
of
surrey
attired
as
upon
the
previous
day
and
mounted
on
a
fiery
arabian
trapped
in
crimson
velvet
fringed
with
venetian
gold
both
nobles
were
attended
by
their
esquires
in
their
liveries
behind
them
came
a
chariot
covered
with
cloth
of
silver
and
drawn
like
the
first
by
four
horses
in
rich
housings
containing
two
very
beautiful
damsels
one
of
whom
attracted
so
much
of
the
attention
of
the
youthful
nobles
that
it
was
with
difficulty
they
could
preserve
due
order
of
march
the
young
dame
in
question
was
about
seventeen
her
face
was
oval
in
form
with
features
of
the
utmost
delicacy
and
regularity
her
complexion
was
fair
and
pale
and
contrasted
strikingly
with
her
jetty
brows
and
magnificent
black
eyes
of
oriental
size
tenderness
and
lustre
her
dark
and
luxuriant
tresses
were
confined
by
a

of
black
velvet
faced
with
white
satin
and
ornamented
with
pearls
her
gown
was
of
white
satin
worked
with
gold
and
had
long
open
pendent
sleeves
while
from
her
slender
and
marble
neck
hung
a
cordeliere
a
species
of
necklace
imitated
from
the
cord
worn
by
franciscan
friars
and
formed
of
crimson
silk
twisted
with
threads
of
venetian
this
fair
creature
was
the
lady
elizabeth
fitzgerald
daughter
of
gerald
fitzgerald
ninth
earl
of
kildare
who
claimed
descent
from
the
geraldi
family
of
florence
but
she
was
generally
known
by
the
appellation
of
the
fair
geraldine
a
title
bestowed
upon
her
on
account
of
her
beauty
by
the
king
and
by
which
she
still
lives
and
will
continue
to
live
as
long
as
poetry
endures
in
the
deathless
and
enchanting
strains
of
her
lover
the
earl
of
surrey
at
the
instance
of
her
mother
lady
kildare
the
fair
geraldine
was
brought
up
with
the
princess
mary
afterwards
queen
of
england
but
she
had
been
lately
assigned
by
the
royal
order
as
one
of
the
attendants
a
post
equivalent
to
that
of
maid
of
honour
to
anne
boleyn
her
companion
was
the
lady
mary
howard
the
sister
of
the
earl
of
surrey
a
nymph
about
her
own
age
and
possessed
of
great
personal
attractions
having
features
radiant
blue
eyes
light
tresses
and
a
complexion
of
dazzling
clearness
lady
mary
howard
nourished
a
passion
for
the
duke
of
richmond
whom
she
saw
with
secret
chagrin
captivated
by
the
superior
charms
of
the
fair
geraldine
her
uneasiness
however
was
in
some
degree
abated
by
the
knowledge
which
as
confidante
of
the
latter
she
had
obtained
that
her
brother
was
master
of
her
heart
lady
mary
was
dressed
in
blue
velvet
cut
and
lined
with
cloth
of
gold
and
wore
a
headgear
of
white
velvet
ornamented
with
pearls
just
as
the
cavalcade
came
in
sight
of
datchet
bridge
the
duke
of
richmond
turned
his
horse
head
and
rode
up
to
the
side
of
the
chariot
on
which
the
fair
geraldine
was
sitting
i
am
come
to
tell
you
of
a
marvellous
adventure
that
befell
surrey
in
the
home
park
at
windsor
last
night
he
said
he
declares
he
has
seen
the
demon
hunter
then
pray
let
the
earl
of
surrey
relate
the
adventure
to
us
himself
replied
the
fair
geraldine
no
one
can
tell
a
story
so
well
as
the
hero
of
the
duke
signed
to
the
youthful
earl
who
was
glancing
rather
wistfully
at
them
and
he
immediately
joined
them
while
richmond
passed
over
to
the
lady
mary
howard
surrey
then
proceeded
to
relate
what
had
happened
to
him
in
the
park
and
the
fair
geraldine
listened
to
his
recital
with
breathless
interest
heaven
shield
us
from
evil
spirits
she
exclaimed
crossing
herself
but
what
is
the
history
of
this
wicked
hunter
my
lord
and
why
did
he
incur
such
a
dreadful
doom
i
know
nothing
more
than
that
he
was
a
keeper
in
the
forest
who
having
committed
some
heinous
crime
hanged
himself
from
a
branch
of
the
oak
beneath
which
i
found
the
keeper
morgan
fenwolf
and
which
still
bears
his
name
replied
the
earl
for
this
unrighteous
act
he
can
not
obtain
rest
but
is
condemned
to
wander
through
the
forest
at
midnight
where
he
wreaks
his
vengeance
in
blasting
the
the
legend
i
have
heard
differs
from
yours
observed
the
duke
of
richmond
it
runs
that
the
spirit
by
which
the
forest
is
haunted
is
a
who
assumes
the
shape
of
the
ghostly
hunter
and
seeks
to
tempt
or
terrify
the
keepers
to
sell
their
souls
to
your
grace
legend
is
the
better
of
the
two
said
lady
mary
howard
or
rather
i
should
say
the
more
probable
i
trust
the
evil
spirit
did
not
make
you
any
such
offer
brother
of
surrey
the
earl
gravely
shook
his
head
if
i
were
to
meet
him
and
he
offered
me
my
heart
dearest
wish
i
fear
he
would
prevail
with
me
observed
the
duke
glancing
tenderly
at
the
fair
geraldine
tush
the
subject
is
too
serious
for
jesting
richmond
said
surrey
almost
sternly
his
grace
as
is
usual
in
compacts
with
the
fiend
might
have
reason
to
rue
his
bargain
observed
lady
mary
howard
peevishly
if
the
earl
of
surrey
were
my
brother
remarked
the
fair
geraldine
to
the
lady
mary
i
would
interdict
him
from
roaming
in
the
park
after
he
is
very
wilful
said
lady
mary
smiling
and
holds
my
commands
but
let
the
fair
geraldine
lay
hers
upon
me
and
she
shall
not
have
to
reproach
me
with
disobedience
rejoined
the
earl
i
must
interpose
to
prevent
their
utterance
cried
richmond
with
a
somewhat
jealous
look
at
his
friend
for
i
have
determined
to
know
more
of
this
mystery
and
shall
require
the
earl
assistance
to
unravel
it
i
think
i
remember
morgan
fenwolf
the
keeper
and
will
send
for
him
to
the
castle
and
question
him
but
in
any
case
i
and
surrey
will
visit
herne
oak
the
remonstrances
of
both
ladies
were
interrupted
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
will
sommers
what
ho
my
lords
to
your
places
to
your
places
cried
the
jester
in
a
shrill
angry
voice
see
ye
not
we
are
close
upon
datchet
bridge
ye
can
converse
with
these
fair
dames
at
a
more
fitting
season
but
it
is
the
king
pleasure
that
the
cavalcade
should
make
a
goodly
show
to
your
places
i
say
laughing
at
the
jester
peremptory
injunction
the
two
young
nobles
nevertheless
obeyed
it
and
bending
almost
to
the
to
the
ladies
resumed
their
posts
the
concourse
assembled
on
datchet
bridge
welcomed
anne
boleyn
arrival
with
loud
acclamations
while
joyous
strains
proceeded
from
sackbut
and
psaltery
and
echoing
blasts
from
the
trumpets
caps
were
flung
into
the
air
and
a
piece
of
ordnance
was
fired
from
the
barge
which
was
presently
afterwards
answered
by
the
castle
guns
having
paid
his
homage
to
anne
boleyn
the
mayor
rejoined
the
company
of
bailiffs
and
burgesses
and
the
whole
cavalcade
crossed
the
bridge
winding
their
way
slowly
along
the
banks
of
the
river
the
barge
with
the
minstrels
playing
in
it
accompanying
them
the
while
in
this
way
they
reached
windsor
and
as
anne
boleyn
gazed
up
at
the
lordly
castle
above
which
the
royal
standard
now
floated
proud
and
aspiring
thoughts
swelled
her
heart
and
she
longed
for
the
hour
when
she
should
approach
it
as
its
mistress
just
then
her
eye
chanced
on
sir
thomas
wyat
who
was
riding
behind
her
amongst
the
knights
and
she
felt
though
it
might
cost
her
a
struggle
that
love
would
yield
to
ambition
leaving
the
barge
and
its
occupants
to
await
the
king
arrival
the
cavalcade
ascended
thames
street
and
were
welcomed
everywhere
with
acclamations
and
rejoicing
bryan
bowntance
who
had
stationed
himself
on
the
right
of
the
arch
in
front
of
his
house
attempted
to
address
anne
boleyn
but
could
not
bring
forth
a
word
his
failure
how
ever
was
more
successful
than
his
speech
might
have
been
inasmuch
as
it
excited
abundance
of
merriment
arrived
at
the
area
in
front
of
the
lower
gateway
anne
boleyn
litter
was
drawn
up
in
the
midst
of
it
and
the
whole
of
the
cavalcade
grouping
around
her
presented
a
magnificent
sight
to
the
archers
and
arquebusiers
stationed
on
the
towers
and
walls
just
at
this
moment
a
signal
gun
was
heard
from
datchet
bridge
announcing
that
the
king
had
reached
it
and
the
dukes
of
suffolk
norfolk
and
richmond
together
with
the
earl
of
surrey
sir
thomas
wyat
and
a
few
of
their
gentle
men
rode
back
to
meet
him
they
had
scarcely
however
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
when
the
royal
party
appeared
in
view
for
the
king
with
his
characteristic
impatience
on
drawing
near
the
castle
had
urged
his
attendants
quickly
forward
first
came
half
a
dozen
trumpeters
with
silken
bandrols
fluttering
in
the
breeze
blowing
loud
flourishes
then
a
party
of
halberdiers
whose
leaders
had
pennons
streaming
from
the
tops
of
their
tall
pikes
next
came
two
gentlemen
ushers
bareheaded
but
mounted
and
richly
habited
belonging
to
the
cardinal
of
york
who
cried
out
as
they
pressed
forward
on
before
my
masters
on
before
make
way
for
my
then
came
a
bearing
a
great
mace
of
silver
and
two
gentlemen
carrying
each
a
pillar
of
silver
next
rode
a
gentleman
carrying
the
cardinal
hat
and
after
him
came
wolsey
himself
mounted
on
a
mule
trapped
in
crimson
velvet
with
a
saddle
covered
with
the
same
stuff
and
gilt
stirrups
his
large
person
was
arrayed
in
robes
of
the
finest
crimson
satin
engrained
and
a
silk
cap
of
the
same
colour
contrasted
by
its
brightness
with
the
pale
purple
tint
of
his
sullen
morose
and
bloated
features
the
cardinal
took
no
notice
of
the
clamour
around
him
but
now
and
then
when
an
expression
of
dislike
was
uttered
against
him
for
he
had
already
begun
to
be
unpopular
with
the
people
he
would
raise
his
eyes
and
direct
a
withering
glance
at
the
hardy
speaker
but
these
expressions
were
few
for
though
tottering
wolsey
was
yet
too
formidable
to
be
insulted
with
impunity
on
either
side
of
him
were
two
mounted
attend
ants
each
caring
a
gilt
poleaxe
who
if
he
had
given
the
word
would
have
instantly
chastised
the
insolence
of
the
bystanders
while
behind
him
rode
his
two
upon
homes
trapped
in
scarlet
wolsey
princely
retinue
was
followed
by
a
litter
of
crimson
velvet
in
which
lay
the
pope
legate
cardinal
campeggio
whose
infirmities
were
so
great
that
he
could
not
move
without
assistance
campeggio
was
likewise
attended
by
a
numerous
train
after
a
long
line
of
lords
knights
and
esquires
came
henry
the
eighth
he
was
apparelled
in
a
robe
of
crimson
velvet
furred
with
ermines
and
wore
a
doublet
of
raised
gold
the
placard
of
which
was
embroidered
with
diamonds
rubies
emeralds
large
pearls
and
other
precious
stones
about
his
neck
was
a
baldric
of
balas
rubies
and
over
his
robe
he
wore
the
collar
of
the
order
of
the
garter
his
horse
a
charger
of
the
largest
size
and
well
able
to
sustain
his
vast
weight
was
trapped
in
crimson
velvet
purfled
with
ermines
his
knights
and
esquires
were
clothed
in
purple
velvet
and
his
henchmen
in
scarlet
tunics
of
the
same
make
as
those
worn
by
the
warders
of
the
tower
at
the
present
day
henry
was
in
his
year
and
though
somewhat
overgrown
and
heavy
had
lost
none
of
his
activity
and
but
little
of
the
grace
of
his
noble
proportions
his
size
and
breadth
of
limb
were
well
displayed
in
his
magnificent
habiliment
his
countenance
was
handsome
and
manly
with
a
certain
broad
burly
look
thoroughly
english
in
its
character
which
won
him
much
admiration
from
his
subjects
and
though
it
might
be
objected
that
the
eyes
were
too
small
and
the
mouth
somewhat
too
diminutive
it
could
not
be
denied
that
the
general
expression
of
the
face
was
kingly
in
the
extreme
a
prince
of
a
more
royal
presence
than
henry
the
eighth
was
never
seen
and
though
he
had
many
and
grave
faults
want
of
dignity
was
not
amongst
the
number
henry
entered
windsor
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
spectators
the
fanfares
of
trumpeters
and
the
roar
of
ordnance
from
the
castle
walls
meanwhile
anne
boleyn
having
descended
from
her
litter
which
passed
through
the
gate
into
the
lower
ward
stood
with
her
ladies
beneath
the
canopy
awaiting
his
arrival
a
wide
clear
space
was
preserved
before
her
into
which
however
wolsey
penetrated
and
dismounting
placed
himself
so
that
he
could
witness
the
meeting
between
her
and
the
king
behind
him
stood
the
jester
will
sommers
who
was
equally
curious
with
himself
the
litter
of
cardinal
campeggio
passed
through
the
gateway
and
proceeded
to
the
lodgings
reserved
for
his
eminence
scarcely
had
wolsey
taken
up
his
station
than
henry
rode
up
and
alighting
consigned
his
horse
to
a
page
and
followed
by
the
duke
of
richmond
and
the
earl
of
surrey
advanced
towards
anne
boleyn
who
immediately
stepped
forward
to
meet
him
fair
mistress
he
said
taking
her
hand
and
regarding
her
with
a
look
of
passionate
devotion
i
welcome
you
to
this
my
castle
of
windsor
and
trust
soon
to
make
you
as
absolute
mistress
of
it
as
i
am
lord
and
anne
boleyn
blushed
and
cast
down
her
eyes
and
sir
thomas
wyat
who
stood
at
some
little
distance
with
his
hand
upon
his
saddle
regarding
her
felt
that
any
hopes
he
might
have
entertained
were
utterly
annihilated
heard
you
that
my
lord
cardinal
said
will
sommers
to
wolsey
she
will
soon
be
mistress
here
as
she
comes
in
you
go
out
mind
that
the
cardinal
made
no
answer
further
than
was
conveyed
by
the
deepened
colour
of
his
cheeks
amid
continued
fanfares
and
acclamations
harry
then
led
anne
boleyn
through
the
gateway
followed
by
the
ladies
in
waiting
who
were
joined
by
richmond
and
surrey
the
prelate
chancellor
register
black
rod
and
other
officers
of
the
garter
together
with
the
whole
of
the
royal
retinue
who
had
dismounted
came
after
them
a
vast
concourse
of
spectators
extending
almost
as
far
as
the
lieutenant
tower
was
collected
in
front
of
the
houses
but
a
wide
space
had
been
kept
clear
by
the
henchmen
for
the
passage
of
the
sovereign
and
his
train
and
along
this
henry
proceeded
with
anne
boleyn
in
the
direction
of
the
upper
ward
just
as
he
reached
the
norman
tower
and
passed
the
entrance
to
the
keep
the
duke
of
shoreditch
who
was
standing
beneath
the
gateway
advanced
towards
him
and
prostrated
himself
on
one
knee
may
it
please
your
majesty
said
shoreditch
i
last
night
arrested
a
butcher
of
windsor
for
uttering
words
highly
disrespectful
of
your
highness
and
of
the
fair
and
virtuous
lady
by
your
ah
god
death
exclaimed
the
king
where
is
the
traitor
bring
him
before
he
is
here
replied
shoreditch
and
immediately
mark
fytton
was
brought
forward
by
a
couple
of
halberdiers
he
still
preserved
his
undaunted
demeanour
and
gazed
sternly
at
the
king
so
fellow
thou
hast
dared
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
us
ha
cried
henry
i
have
spoken
the
truth
replied
the
butcher
fearlessly
i
have
said
you
were
about
to
divorce
your
lawful
consort
catherine
of
arragon
and
to
take
the
minion
anne
boleyn
who
stands
beside
you
to
your
bed
and
i
added
it
was
a
wrongful
foul
befall
thy
lying
tongue
for
saying
so
replied
henry
furiously
i
have
a
mind
to
pluck
it
from
thy
throat
and
cast
it
to
the
dogs
what
ho
guards
take
this
caitiff
to
the
summit
of
the
highest
tower
of
the
castle
the
curfew
tower
and
hang
him
from
it
so
that
all
my
loyal
subjects
in
windsor
may
see
how
traitors
are
your
highness
has
judged
him
justly
said
anne
boleyn
you
say
so
now
mistress
anne
boleyn
rejoined
the
butcher
but
you
yourself
shall
one
day
stand
in
as
much
peril
of
your
life
as
i
do
and
shall
plead
as
vainly
as
i
should
were
i
to
plead
at
all
which
i
will
never
do
to
this
inexorable
tyrant
you
will
then
remember
my
away
with
him
cried
henry
i
myself
will
go
to
the
garter
tower
to
see
it
done
farewell
for
a
short
while
sweetheart
i
will
read
these
partisans
of
catherine
a
terrible
as
the
butcher
was
hurried
off
to
the
curfew
tower
the
king
proceeded
with
his
attendants
to
the
garter
tower
and
ascended
to
its
summit
in
less
than
ten
minutes
a
stout
pole
like
the
mast
of
a
ship
was
thrust
through
the
battlements
of
the
curfew
tower
on
the
side
looking
towards
the
town
to
this
pole
a
rope
of
some
dozen
feet
in
length
and
having
a
noose
at
one
end
was
firmly
secured
the
butcher
was
then
brought
forth
bound
hand
and
foot
and
the
noose
was
thrown
over
his
neck
while
this
was
passing
the
wretched
man
descried
a
person
looking
at
him
from
a
window
in
a
wooden
structure
projecting
from
the
side
of
the
tower
what
are
you
there
morgan
fenwolf
he
cried
remember
what
passed
between
us
in
the
dungeon
last
night
and
be
warned
you
will
not
meet
your
end
as
firmly
as
i
meet
mine
make
thy
shrift
quickly
fellow
if
thou
hast
aught
to
say
interposed
one
of
the
halberdiers
i
have
no
shrift
to
make
rejoined
the
butcher
i
have
already
settled
my
account
with
heaven
god
preserve
queen
catherine
as
he
uttered
these
words
he
was
thrust
off
from
the
battlements
by
the
halberdiers
and
his
body
swung
into
the
abyss
amid
the
hootings
and
execrations
of
the
spectators
below
having
glutted
his
eyes
with
the
horrible
sight
henry
descended
from
the
tower
and
returned
to
anne
boleyn
iv
how
king
henry
the
eighth
held
a
chapter
of
the
garter
how
he
attended
vespers
and
matins
in
saint
george
chapel
and
how
he
feasted
with
the
knights
companions
in
saint
george
hall
from
a
balcony
overlooking
the
upper
ward
anne
boleyn
beheld
the
king
approach
on
his
return
from
the
garter
tower
and
waving
her
hand
smilingly
to
him
she
withdrew
into
the
hastening
to
her
henry
found
her
surrounded
by
her
ladies
of
honour
by
the
chief
of
the
nobles
and
knights
who
had
composed
her
train
from
hampton
court
and
by
the
cardinals
wolsey
and
campeggio
and
having
exchanged
a
few
words
with
her
he
took
her
hand
and
led
her
to
the
upper
part
of
the
chamber
where
two
chairs
of
state
were
set
beneath
a
canopy
of
crimson
velvet
embroidered
with
the
royal
arms
and
placed
her
in
the
seat
hitherto
allotted
to
catherine
of
arragon
a
smile
of
triumph
irradiated
anne
lovely
countenance
at
this
mark
of
distinction
nor
was
her
satisfaction
diminished
as
henry
turned
to
address
the
assemblage
my
lords
he
said
ye
are
right
well
aware
of
the
scruples
of
conscience
i
entertain
in
regard
to
my
marriage
with
my
brother
widow
catherine
of
arragon
the
more
i
weigh
the
matter
the
more
convinced
am
i
of
its
unlawfulness
and
were
it
possible
to
blind
myself
to
my
sinful
condition
the
preachers
who
openly
rebuke
me
from
the
pulpit
would
take
care
to
remind
me
of
it
misunderstand
me
not
my
lords
i
have
no
ground
of
complaint
against
the
queen
far
otherwise
she
is
a
lady
of
most
excellent
character
full
of
devotion
loyalty
nobility
and
gentleness
and
if
i
could
divest
myself
of
my
misgivings
so
far
from
seeking
to
put
her
from
me
i
should
cherish
her
with
the
greatest
tenderness
ye
may
marvel
that
i
have
delayed
the
divorce
thus
long
but
it
is
only
of
late
that
my
eyes
have
been
opened
and
the
step
was
hard
to
take
old
affections
clung
to
me
old
chains
restrained
me
nor
could
i
without
compunction
separate
myself
from
one
who
has
ever
been
to
me
a
virtuous
and
devoted
thou
hast
undergone
a
martyrdom
gossip
observed
will
sommers
who
had
posted
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
canopy
near
the
king
and
shalt
henceforth
be
denominated
saint
the
gravity
of
the
hearers
might
have
been
discomposed
by
this
remark
but
for
the
stern
looks
of
the
king
ye
may
make
a
jest
of
my
scruples
my
lords
he
continued
and
think
i
hold
them
lightly
but
my
treatise
on
the
subject
which
has
cost
me
much
labour
and
meditation
will
avouch
to
the
contrary
what
would
befall
this
realm
if
my
marriage
were
called
in
question
after
my
decease
the
same
trouble
and
confusion
would
ensue
that
followed
on
the
death
of
my
noble
grandfather
king
edward
the
fourth
to
prevent
such
mischance
i
have
resolved
most
reluctantly
to
put
away
my
present
queen
and
to
take
another
consort
by
whom
i
trust
to
raise
up
a
worthy
successor
and
inheritor
of
my
a
murmur
of
applause
followed
this
speech
and
the
two
cardinals
exchanged
significant
glances
which
were
not
unobserved
by
the
king
i
doubt
not
ye
will
all
approve
the
choice
i
shall
make
he
pursued
looking
fiercely
at
wolsey
and
taking
anne
boleyn
hand
who
arose
as
he
turned
to
her
and
now
fair
mistress
he
added
to
her
as
an
earnest
of
the
regard
i
have
for
you
and
of
the
honours
i
intend
you
i
hereby
create
you
marchioness
of
pembroke
and
bestow
upon
you
a
thousand
marks
a
year
in
land
and
another
thousand
to
be
paid
out
of
my
treasury
to
support
your
your
majesty
is
too
generous
replied
anne
bending
the
knee
and
kissing
his
hand
not
a
whit
sweetheart
not
a
whit
replied
henry
tenderly
raising
her
this
is
but
a
slight
mark
of
my
goodwill
sir
thomas
boleyn
he
added
to
her
father
henceforth
your
style
and
title
will
be
that
of
viscount
rochford
and
your
patent
will
be
made
out
at
the
same
time
as
that
of
your
daughter
the
marchioness
of
pembroke
i
also
elect
you
a
of
the
most
honourable
order
of
the
garter
and
your
investiture
and
installation
will
take
place
having
received
the
thanks
and
homage
of
the
noble
henry
descended
from
the
canopy
and
passed
into
an
inner
room
with
the
lady
anne
where
a
collation
was
prepared
for
them
their
slight
meal
over
anne
took
up
her
lute
and
playing
a
lively
prelude
sang
two
or
three
french
songs
with
so
much
skill
and
grace
that
henry
who
was
passionately
fond
of
music
was
quite
enraptured
two
delightful
hours
having
passed
by
almost
imperceptibly
an
usher
approached
the
king
and
whispering
a
few
words
to
him
he
reluctantly
withdrew
and
anne
retired
with
her
ladies
to
an
inner
apartment
on
reaching
his
closet
the
king
attendants
proceeded
to
array
him
in
a
surcoat
of
crimson
velvet
powdered
with
garters
embroidered
in
silk
and
gold
with
the
motto
boni

over

having
on

the

completed
by

like
it
with
small
embroidered
garters
and
lined
with
white

it
before

during
all
the
proceedings

the
feast
meanwhile
the
having
drawn
up
on

henry
advanced
with
a
slow
and
stately
step
towards

his
train
borne
by
the
earl
of

up
a
little
on

their
salutation
to
him

he
returned
by
removing
his
jewelled
cap
with
infinite
grace
and
dignity

as
soon

formed

of
the
group
near
the

is
lost
to
thee
for
ever
thou
aught
of
womankind
would
hesitate
between
a
simple
knight
and
a
king
my
lord
duke
he
added
sharply
to
richmond
who
was
looking
round
at
him
you
would
rather
be
in
yonder
gallery
than
why
so
knave
asked
the
duke
because
the
fair
geraldine
is
there
replied
the
jester
and
yet
your
grace
is
not
the
person
she
would
most
desire
to
have
with
whom
would
she
prefer
inquired
the
duke
angrily
the
jester
nodded
at
surrey
and
laughed
maliciously
you
heard
the
health
given
by
the
king
just
now
my
lord
observed
the
duke
of
suffolk
to
his
neighbour
the
duke
of
norfolk
it
was
a
shrewd
hint
to
the
lord
legate
which
way
his
judgment
should
decline
your
niece
will
assuredly
be
queen
of
i
did
not
note
what
was
said
my
lord
replied
norfolk
i
pray
you
repeat
it
to
suffolk
complied
and
they
continued
in
close
debate
until
the
termination
of
the
banquet
when
the
king
having
saluted
the
company
returned
to
the
of
the
ghostly
chase
beheld
by
the
earl
of
surrey
and
the
duke
of
richmond
in
windsor
forest
on
that
same
night
and
just
as
the
castle
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
the
earl
of
surrey
and
the
duke
of
richmond
issued
from
the
upper
gate
and
took
their
way
towards
herne
oak
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
and
its
beams
silvered
the
foliage
of
the
noble
trees
with
which
the
park
was
studded
the
youthful
friends
soon
reached
the
blasted
tree
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
near
it
and
all
looked
so
tranquil
so
free
from
malignant
influence
that
the
duke
of
richmond
could
not
help
laughing
at
his
companion
telling
him
that
the
supposed
vision
must
have
been
the
offspring
of
his
fancy
angry
at
being
thus
doubted
the
earl
walked
off
and
plunged
into
the
haunted
dell
the
duke
followed
but
though
they
paused
for
some
time
beneath
the
gnarled
the
spirit
did
not
appear
and
thus
ends
the
adventure
of
herne
the
hunter
laughed
the
duke
as
they
emerged
from
the
brake
by
my
halidom
surrey
i
am
grievously
disappointed
you
must
have
mistaken
some
large
stag
caught
by
its
antlers
in
the
branches
of
the
for
the
i
have
told
you
precisely
what
occurred
replied
surrey
angrily
ha
there
he
is
look
look
and
he
pointed
to
a
weird
figure
mounted
on
a
steed
as
as
itself
galloping
through
the
trees
with
extraordinary
swiftness
at
a
little
distance
from
them
this
ghostly
rider
wore
the
antlered
helmet
described
by
surrey
and
seemed
to
be
habited
in
a
garb
of
before
him
flew
a
large
owl
and
a
couple
of
great
black
dogs
ran
beside
him
staring
in
speechless
wonder
at
the
sight
the
two
youths
watched
the
mysterious
being
scour
a
glade
brightly
illumined
by
the
moon
until
reaching
the
pales
marking
the
confines
of
the
home
park
he
leaped
them
and
disappeared
what
think
you
of
that
cried
surrey
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
from
his
surprise
glancing
triumphantly
at
the
duke
was
that
the
offspring
of
my
fancy
it
was
a
marvellous
sight
truly
exclaimed
richmond
would
we
had
our
steeds
to
follow
we
can
follow
him
on
foot
replied
the
earl
he
is
evidently
gone
into
the
and
they
set
off
at
a
quick
pace
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
ghostly
rider
clambering
the
park
pales
they
crossed
the
road
leading
to
old
windsor
and
entered
that
part
of
the
forest
which
in
more
recent
times
has
been
enclosed
and
allotted
to
the
grounds
of
frogmore
tracking
a
long
vista
they
came
to
a
thick
dell
overgrown
with
large
oaks
at
the
bottom
of
which
lay
a
small
pool
fleeter
than
his
companion
and
therefore
somewhat
in
advance
of
him
the
earl
of
surrey
as
he
approached
this
dell
perceived
the
spectral
huntsman
and
his
dogs
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
water
the
earl
instantly
shouted
to
him
and
the
horseman
turning
his
head
shook
his
hand
menacingly
while
the
hounds
glared
fiercely
at
the
intruder
and
displayed
their
fangs
but
did
not
bark
as
surrey
however
despite
this
caution
continued
to
advance
the
huntsman
took
a
strangely
shaped
horn
that
hung
by
his
side
and
placing
it
to
his
lips
flames
and
thick
smoke
presently
issued
from
it
and
before
the
vapour
had
cleared
off
he
and
his
dogs
had
the
witnesses
of
this
marvellous
spectacle
crossed
themselves
reverently
and
descended
to
the
brink
of
the
pool
but
the
numerous
footprints
of
deer
that
came
there
to
drink
prevented
them
from
distinguishing
any
marks
of
the
steed
of
the
ghostly
hunter
shall
we
return
surrey
asked
the
duke
no
replied
the
earl
i
am
persuaded
we
shall
see
the
mysterious
huntsman
again
you
can
return
if
you
think
proper
i
will
go
nay
i
will
not
leave
you
rejoined
richmond
and
they
set
off
again
at
the
same
quick
pace
as
before
mounting
a
hill
covered
with
noble
beeches
and
elms
a
magnificent
view
of
the
castle
burst
upon
them
towering
over
the
groves
they
had
tracked
and
looking
almost
like
the
work
of
enchantment
charmed
with
the
view
the
young
men
continued
to
contemplate
it
for
some
time
they
then
struck
off
on
the
right
and
ascended
still
higher
until
they
came
to
a
beautiful
grove
of
beeches
cresting
the
hill
where
the
equestrian
statue
of
george
the
third
is
now
placed
skirting
this
grove
they
disturbed
a
herd
of
deer
which
started
up
and
darted
into
the
valley
below
at
the
foot
of
two
fine
lay
another
small
pool
and
surrey
almost
expected
to
see
the
spectral
huntsman
beside
it
from
this
spot
they
could
discern
the
whole
of
the
valley
beyond
and
they
scanned
it
in
the
hope
of
perceiving
the
object
of
their
search
though
not
comparable
to
the
view
on
the
nearer
side
the
prospect
was
nevertheless
exceedingly
beautiful
long
vistas
and
glades
stretched
out
before
them
while
in
the
far
distance
might
be
seen
glittering
in
the
moonbeams
the
lake
or
mere
which
in
later
days
has
received
the
name
of
virginia
water
while
they
were
gazing
at
this
scene
a
figure
habited
like
a
keeper
of
the
forest
suddenly
emerged
from
the
trees
at
the
lower
end
of
one
of
the
glades
persuaded
that
this
person
had
some
mysterious
connection
with
the
ghostly
huntsman
the
earl
determined
to
follow
him
and
hastily
mentioning
his
suspicions
and
design
to
richmond
he
hurried
down
the
hill
but
before
he
accomplished
the
descent
the
keeper
was
gone
at
length
however
on
looking
about
they
perceived
him
mounting
the
rising
ground
on
the
left
and
immediately
started
after
him
taking
care
to
keep
out
of
sight
the
policy
of
this
course
was
soon
apparent
supposing
himself
no
longer
pursued
the
keeper
relaxed
his
pace
and
the
others
got
nearer
to
him
in
this
way
both
parties
went
on
the
keeper
still
hurrying
forward
every
now
and
then
turning
his
head
to
see
whether
any
one
was
on
his
track
until
he
came
to
a
road
cut
through
the
trees
that
brought
him
to
the
edge
of
a
descent
leading
to
the
lake
just
at
this
moment
a
cloud
passed
over
the
moon
burying
all
in
comparative
obscurity
the
watchers
however
could
perceive
the
keeper
approach
an
ancient
of
enormous
growth
and
strike
it
thrice
with
the
short
which
he
held
in
his
grasp
the
signal
remaining
unanswered
he
quitted
the
tree
and
shaped
his
course
along
the
side
of
a
hill
on
the
right
keeping
under
the
shelter
of
the
thicket
on
the
top
of
the
same
hill
surrey
and
richmond
followed
and
saw
him
direct
his
steps
towards
another
of
almost
double
the
girth
of
that
he
had
just
visited
arrived
at
this
mighty
tree
he
struck
it
with
his
spear
while
a
large
owl
seated
on
a
leafless
branch
began
to
hoot
a
bat
circled
the
tree
and
two
large
snakes
glistening
in
the
moonlight
glided
from
its
roots
as
the
tree
was
stricken
for
the
third
time
the
same
weird
figure
that
the
watchers
had
seen
ride
along
the
home
park
burst
from
its
riften
trunk
and
addressed
its
summoner
in
tones
apparently
menacing
and
imperious
but
whose
import
was
lost
upon
the
listeners
the
curiosity
of
the
beholders
was
roused
to
the
highest
pitch
but
an
undefinable
awe
prevented
them
from
rushing
forward
suddenly
the
demon
hunter
waved
a
pike
with
which
he
was
armed
and
uttered
a
peculiar
cry
resembling
the
hooting
of
an
owl
at
this
sound
and
as
if
by
magic
a
couple
of
steeds
accompanied
by
the
two
hounds
started
from
the
brake
in
an
instant
the
demon
huntsman
vaulted
upon
the
hack
of
the
horse
nearest
to
him
and
the
keeper
almost
as
quickly
mounted
the
other
the
pair
then
galloped
off
through
the
glen
the
owl
flying
before
them
and
the
hounds
coursing
by
their
side
the
two
friends
gazed
at
each
other
for
some
time
in
speechless
wonder
taking
heart
they
then
descended
to
the
haunted
tree
but
could
perceive
no
traces
of
the
strange
being
by
whom
it
had
been
recently
tenanted
after
a
while
they
retraced
their
course
towards
the
castle
hoping
they
might
once
more
encounter
the
wild
huntsman
nor
were
they
disappointed
as
they
crossed
a
glen
a
noble
stag
darted
by
close
at
its
heels
came
the
two
black
hounds
and
after
them
the
riders
hurrying
forward
at
a
furious
pace
their
steeds
appearing
to
breathe
forth
flame
and
smoke
in
an
instant
the
huntsmen
and
hounds
were
gone
and
the
trampling
of
the
horses
died
away
in
the
distance
soon
afterwards
a
low
sound
like
the
winding
of
a
horn
broke
upon
the
ear
and
the
listeners
had
no
doubt
that
the
buck
was
brought
down
they
hurried
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
but
though
the
view
was
wholly
unobstructed
for
a
considerable
distance
they
could
see
nothing
either
of
horsemen
hounds
or
deer
vi
how
the
fair
geraldine
bestowed
a
relic
upon
her
lover
how
surrey
and
richmond
rode
in
the
forest
at
midnight
and
where
they
found
the
body
of
mark
fytton
the
butcher
surrey
and
richmond
agreed
to
say
nothing
for
the
present
of
their
mysterious
adventure
in
the
forest
but
their
haggard
looks
as
they
presented
themselves
to
the
lady
anne
boleyn
in
the
on
the
following
morning
proclaimed
that
something
had
happened
and
they
had
to
undergo
much
questioning
from
the
fair
geraldine
and
the
lady
mary
howard
i
never
saw
you
so
out
of
spirits
my
lord
remarked
the
fair
geraldine
to
surrey
you
must
have
spent
the
whole
night
in
study
or
what
is
more
probable
you
have
again
seen
herne
the
hunter
confess
now
you
have
been
in
the
i
will
confess
anything
you
please
replied
surrey
evasively
and
what
have
you
seen
a
stranger
vision
than
the
first
rejoined
the
fair
geraldine
since
your
ladyship
answers
for
me
there
is
no
need
for
explanation
on
my
part
rejoined
surrey
with
a
faint
laugh
and
know
you
not
that
those
who
encounter
super
natural
beings
are
generally
bound
to
profound
secrecy
such
i
hope
is
not
your
case
henry
cried
the
lady
mary
howard
in
alarm
nor
yours
my
lord
she
added
to
the
duke
of
richmond
i
am
bound
equally
with
surrey
returned
the
duke
mysteriously
you
pique
my
curiosity
my
lords
said
the
fair
geraldine
and
since
there
is
no
other
way
of
gratifying
it
if
the
lady
mary
howard
will
accompany
me
we
will
ourselves
venture
into
the
forest
and
try
whether
we
can
not
have
a
meeting
with
this
wild
huntsman
shall
we
go
not
for
worlds
replied
the
lady
mary
shuddering
were
i
to
see
herne
i
should
die
of
your
alarm
is
groundless
observed
richmond
gallantly
the
presence
of
two
beings
fair
and
pure
as
yourself
and
the
lady
elizabeth
fitzgerald
would
scare
away
aught
of
the
lady
mary
thanked
him
with
a
beaming
smile
but
the
fair
geraldine
could
not
suppress
a
slight
laugh
your
grace
is
highly
flattering
she
said
but
with
all
faith
in
beauty
and
purity
i
should
place
most
reliance
in
a
relic
i
possess
the
virtue
of
which
has
often
been
approved
against
evil
spirits
it
was
given
by
a
monk
who
had
been
sorely
tempted
by
a
demon
and
who
owed
his
deliverance
to
it
to
my
ancestor
luigi
geraldi
of
florence
and
from
him
it
descended
to
would
i
had
an
opportunity
of
proving
its
efficacy
exclaimed
the
earl
of
surrey
you
shall
prove
it
if
you
choose
rejoined
the
fair
geraldine
i
will
give
you
the
relic
on
condition
that
you
never
part
with
it
to
friend
or
and
detaching
a
small
cross
of
gold
suspended
by
a
chain
from
her
neck
she
presented
it
to
the
earl
of
surrey
this
cross
encloses
the
relic
she
continued
wear
it
and
may
it
protect
you
from
all
ill
surrey
pale
cheek
glowed
as
he
took
the
gift
i
will
never
past
with
it
but
with
life
he
cried
pressing
the
cross
to
his
lips
and
afterwards
placing
it
next
his
heart
i
would
have
given
half
my
dukedom
to
be
so
favoured
said
richmond
moodily
and
quitting
the
little
group
he
walked
towards
the
lady
anne
henry
said
the
lady
mary
taking
her
brother
aside
you
will
lose
your
i
care
not
replied
surrey
but
you
may
incur
his
enmity
pursued
the
lady
mary
i
saw
the
glance
he
threw
at
you
just
now
and
it
was
exactly
like
the
king
terrible
look
when
again
i
say
i
care
not
replied
surrey
armed
with
this
relic
i
defy
all
it
will
avail
little
against
richmond
rivalry
and
opposition
rejoined
his
sister
we
shall
see
retorted
surrey
were
the
king
himself
my
rival
i
would
not
resign
my
pretensions
to
the
fair
bravely
resolved
my
lord
said
sir
thomas
wyat
who
having
overheard
the
exclamation
advanced
towards
him
heaven
grant
you
may
never
be
placed
in
such
jeopardy
i
say
amen
to
that
prayer
sir
thomas
rejoined
surrey
i
would
not
prove
disloyal
and
yet
under
such
circumstances
what
would
you
do
interrupted
wyat
my
brother
is
but
a
hasty
boy
and
has
not
learned
discretion
sir
thomas
interposed
the
lady
mary
trying
by
a
significant
glance
to
impose
silence
on
the
earl
young
as
he
is
he
loves
well
and
truly
remarked
wyat
in
a
sombre
tone
what
is
all
this
inquired
the
fair
geraldine
who
had
been
gazing
through
the
casement
into
the
court
below
i
was
merely
expressing
a
wish
that
surrey
may
never
have
a
monarch
for
a
rival
fair
lady
replied
wyat
it
matters
little
who
may
be
his
rival
rejoined
geraldine
provided
she
he
loves
be
right
lady
right
said
wyat
with
great
bitterness
at
this
moment
will
sommers
approached
them
i
come
to
bid
you
to
the
lady
presence
sir
thomas
and
you
to
the
king
my
lord
of
surrey
said
the
jester
i
noticed
what
has
just
taken
place
he
remarked
to
the
latter
as
they
proceeded
towards
the
royal
canopy
beneath
which
henry
and
the
lady
anne
boleyn
were
seated
but
richmond
will
not
relinquish
her
tamely
for
all
anne
boleyn
had
summoned
sir
thomas
wyat
in
order
to
gratify
her
vanity
by
showing
him
the
unbounded
influence
she
possessed
over
his
royal
rival
and
the
agony
displayed
by
the
unfortunate
lover
at
the
exhibition
afforded
her
a
pleasure
such
as
only
the
most
refined
coquette
can
feel
surrey
was
sent
for
by
the
king
to
receive
instructions
in
his
quality
of
respecting
a
and
to
be
held
on
successive
days
the
one
in
the
upper
quadrangle
of
the
castle
the
other
in
the
forest
anxious
now
that
he
was
somewhat
calmer
to
avoid
a
rupture
with
richmond
surrey
as
soon
as
he
had
received
the
king
instructions
drew
near
the
duke
and
the
latter
who
had
likewise
reasoned
himself
out
of
his
resentment
was
speedily
appeased
and
they
became
to
all
appearance
as
good
friends
as
ever
soon
afterwards
the
lady
anne
and
her
dames
retired
and
the
court
breaking
up
the
two
young
nobles
strolled
forth
to
the
stately
terrace
at
the
north
of
the
castle
where
while
gazing
at
the
glorious
view
it
commanded
they
talked
over
the
mysterious
event
of
the
previous
night
i
can
not
help
suspecting
that
the
keeper
we
beheld
with
the
demon
hunter
was
morgan
fenwolf
remarked
the
earl
suppose
we
make
inquiry
whether
he
was
at
home
last
night
we
can
readily
find
out
his
dwelling
from
bryan
bowntance
the
host
of
the
richmond
acquiesced
in
the
proposal
and
they
accordingly
proceeded
to
the
cloisters
of
saint
george
chapel
and
threading
some
tortuous
passages
contrived
among
the
canons
houses
passed
through
a
small
porch
guarded
by
a
sentinel
and
opening
upon
a
precipitous
and
somewhat
dangerous
flight
of
steps
hewn
out
of
the
rock
and
leading
to
the
town
none
except
the
more
important
members
of
the
royal
household
were
allowed
to
use
this
means
of
exit
from
the
castle
but
of
course
the
privilege
extended
to
richmond
and
surrey
here
in
later
times
and
when
the
castle
was
not
so
strictly
guarded
a
more
convenient
approach
was
built
and
designated
from
the
number
of
its
stairs
the
hundred
having
accomplished
the
descent
in
safety
and
given
the
password
to
the
sentinel
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
the
two
young
nobles
emerged
into
the
street
and
the
first
object
they
beheld
was
the
body
of
the
miserable
butcher
swinging
from
the
summit
of
the
curfew
tower
where
it
was
left
by
order
of
the
king
averting
their
gaze
from
this
ghastly
spectacle
they
took
their
way
up
thames
street
and
soon
reached
the
garter
honest
bryan
was
seated
on
a
bench
before
the
dwelling
with
a
flagon
of
his
own
ale
beside
him
and
rising
as
he
saw
the
others
approach
he
made
them
a
profound
salutation
upon
leaning
what
they
sought
he
told
them
that
morgan
fenwolf
dwelt
in
a
small
cottage
by
the
not
far
from
the
bridge
and
if
it
pleased
them
he
would
guide
them
to
it
himself
an
offer
which
they
gladly
accepted
do
you
know
anything
of
this
fenwolf
asked
surrey
as
they
proceeded
on
their
way
nothing
particular
replied
bryan
with
some
hesitation
there
are
some
strange
reports
about
him
but
i
do
believe
what
reports
are
they
friend
asked
the
duke
of
richmond
why
your
grace
one
ought
to
be
cautious
what
one
says
for
fear
of
bringing
an
innocent
man
into
trouble
returned
the
host
but
if
the
truth
must
be
spoken
people
do
say
that
morgan
fenwolf
is
in
league
with
the
devil
or
with
herne
the
hunter
which
is
the
same
richmond
exchanged
a
look
with
his
friend
folks
say
strange
sights
have
been
seen
in
the
forest
of
late
pursued
bryan
and
it
may
be
so
but
i
myself
have
seen
nothing
but
then
to
be
sure
i
never
go
there
the
keepers
used
to
talk
of
herne
the
hunter
when
i
was
a
lad
but
i
believe
it
was
only
a
tale
to
frighten
and
i
fancy
it
much
the
same
thing
neither
surrey
nor
richmond
made
any
remark
and
they
presently
reached
the
keeper
dwelling
it
was
a
small
wooden
tenement
standing
as
the
host
had
stated
on
the
bank
of
the
river
about
a
from
the
bridge
the
door
was
opened
by
bryan
and
the
party
entered
without
further
ceremony
they
found
no
one
within
except
an
old
woman
with
harsh
wrinkled
features
and
a
glance
as
as
that
of
a
witch
whom
bryan
bowntance
told
them
was
fenwolf
mother
this
old
crone
regarded
the
intruders
uneasily
where
is
your
son
dame
demanded
the
duke
on
his
walk
in
the
forest
replied
the
old
crone
bluntly
what
time
did
he
go
forth
inquired
surrey
an
hour
before
daybreak
as
is
his
custom
returned
the
woman
in
the
same
short
tone
as
before
you
are
sure
he
slept
at
home
last
night
dame
said
surrey
as
sure
as
i
am
that
the
question
is
asked
me
she
replied
i
can
show
you
the
very
bed
on
which
he
slept
if
you
desire
to
see
it
he
retired
soon
after
sunset
slept
soundly
as
he
always
sleeps
and
arose
as
i
have
told
you
i
lighted
a
fire
and
made
him
some
hot
pottage
if
she
speaks
the
truth
you
must
be
mistaken
observed
richmond
in
a
whisper
to
his
friend
i
do
not
believe
her
replied
surrey
in
the
same
tone
show
us
his
chamber
the
old
crone
sullenly
complied
and
throwing
open
a
side
door
disclosed
an
inner
apartment
in
which
there
was
a
small
bed
there
was
nothing
noticeable
in
the
room
except
a
couple
of
a
and
an
old
a
small
open
casement
looked
upon
the
river
whose
clear
sparkling
waters
flowed
immediately
beneath
it
surrey
approached
the
window
and
obtained
a
fine
view
of
the
brocas
meads
on
the
one
hand
and
the
embowered
college
of
eton
on
the
other
his
attention
however
was
diverted
by
a
fierce
barking
without
and
the
next
moment
in
spite
of
the
vociferations
of
the
old
woman
a
large
black
staghound
which
surrey
recognised
as
fenwolf
dog
bawsey
burst
through
the
door
and
rushed
furiously
towards
him
surrey
drew
his
dagger
to
defend
himself
from
the
hound
attack
but
the
precaution
was
needless
bawsey
fierceness
changed
suddenly
to
the
most
abject
submission
and
with
a
terrified
howl
she
retreated
from
the
room
her
tail
between
her
legs
even
the
old
woman
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
lord
help
us
exclaimed
bryan
was
ever
the
like
o
that
seen
your
lordship
must
have
a
strange
mastery
over
dogs
that
hound
he
added
in
a
whisper
is
said
to
be
a
familiar
the
virtue
of
the
relic
is
approved
observed
surrey
to
richmond
in
an
undertone
it
would
seem
so
replied
the
duke
the
old
woman
now
thought
proper
to
assume
a
more
respectful
demeanour
towards
her
visitors
and
inquired
whether
her
son
should
attend
upon
them
on
his
return
from
the
forest
but
they
said
it
was
unnecessary
the
king
is
about
to
have
a
grand
the
day
after
observed
surrey
and
we
wished
to
give
your
son
some
instructions
respecting
it
they
can
however
be
delivered
to
another
and
they
departed
with
bryan
and
returned
to
the
castle
at
midnight
they
again
issued
forth
their
steeds
awaited
them
near
the
upper
gate
and
mounting
they
galloped
across
the
greensward
in
the
direction
of
herne
oak
discerning
no
trace
of
the
ghostly
huntsman
they
shaped
their
course
towards
the
forest
urging
their
steeds
to
their
utmost
speed
and
skirting
the
long
avenue
they
did
not
draw
the
rein
till
they
reached
the
eminence
beyond
it
having
climbed
which
they
dashed
down
the
farther
side
at
the
same
swift
pace
as
before
the
ride
greatly
excited
them
but
they
saw
nothing
of
the
wild
huntsman
nor
did
any
sound
salute
their
ears
except
the
tramp
of
their
own
horses
or
the
occasional
darting
forth
of
a
startled
deer
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
brought
them
to
the
haunted
but
all
was
as
silent
and
solitary
here
as
at
the
blasted
oak
in
vain
surrey
smote
the
tree
no
answer
was
returned
to
the
summons
and
finding
all
efforts
to
evoke
the
demon
fruitless
they
quitted
the
spot
and
turning
their
horses
heads
to
the
right
slowly
ascended
the
before
they
had
gained
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
faint
blast
of
a
horn
saluted
their
ears
apparently
proceeding
from
the
valley
near
the
lake
they
instantly
stopped
and
looked
in
that
direction
but
could
see
nothing
presently
however
the
blast
was
repeated
more
loudly
than
before
and
guided
by
the
sound
they
discerned
the
spectral
huntsman
riding
beneath
the
trees
at
some
quarter
of
a
mile
distance
striking
spurs
into
their
steeds
they
instantly
gave
him
chase
but
though
he
lured
them
on
through
thicket
and
over
glade
now
climbing
a
hill
now
plunging
into
a
valley
until
their
steeds
began
to
show
symptoms
of
exhaustion
they
got
no
nearer
to
him
and
at
length
as
they
drew
near
the
home
park
to
which
he
had
gradually
led
them
he
disappeared
from
view
i
will
take
my
station
near
the
blasted
oak
said
surrey
galloping
towards
it
the
demon
is
sure
to
revisit
his
favourite
tree
before
what
is
that
cried
the
earl
of
surrey
pointing
to
a
strange
and
object
depending
from
the
tree
some
one
has
hanged
himself
it
may
be
the
caitiff
morgan
with
one
accord
they
dashed
forward
and
as
they
drew
nearer
the
tree
they
perceived
that
the
object
that
had
attracted
their
attention
was
the
body
of
mark
fytton
the
butcher
which
they
had
so
recently
seen
swinging
from
the
summit
of
the
curfew
tower
it
was
now
suspended
from
an
arm
of
the
wizard
oak
a
small
scroll
was
stuck
upon
the
breast
of
the
corpse
and
taking
it
off
surrey
read
these
words
traced
in
uncouth
characters
mark
fytton
is
now
one
of
the
band
of
herne
the
by
my
fay
this
passes
all
comprehension
said
richmond
after
a
few
moments
silence
this
castle
and
forest
seem
under
the
sway
of
the
powers
of
darkness
let
us
return
i
have
had
enough
of
adventure
for
and
he
rode
towards
the
castle
followed
more
slowly
by
the
earl
vii
how
the
earl
of
surrey
and
the
fair
geraldine
plighted
their
troth
in
the
cloisters
of
saint
george
chapel
barriers
were
erected
on
the
following
day
in
the
upper
ward
of
the
castle
and
the
lady
anne
and
her
dames
assembled
in
the
balcony
in
front
of
the
royal
lodgings
which
was
decorated
with
arras
costly
carpets
and
rich
stuffs
to
view
the
spectacle
perfect
in
all
manly
accomplishments
henry
splintered
several
lances
with
his
the
duke
of
suffolk
who
formed
an
admirable
match
for
him
in
point
of
weight
and
strength
and
at
last
though
he
did
not
succeed
in
unhorsing
the
duke
he
struck
off
his
helmet
the
clasp
of
which
it
was
whispered
was
left
designedly
unfastened
and
being
thereupon
declared
the
victor
he
received
the
prize
a
scarf
embroidered
by
her
own
hands
from
the
fair
anne
herself
he
then
retired
from
the
lists
leaving
them
free
for
the
younger
knights
to
run
a
course
at
the
ring
the
first
to
enter
the
arena
was
sir
thomas
wyat
and
as
he
was
known
to
be
a
skilful
jouster
it
was
expected
he
would
come
off
triumphantly
but
a
glance
from
the
royal
balcony
rendered
his
arm
unsteady
and
he
missed
the
mark
next
came
the
duke
of
richmond
superbly
accoutred
laughing
at
ill
success
he
bowed
to
the
fair
geraldine
and
taking
a
lance
from
his
esquire
placed
it
in
the
rest
and
rode
gallantly
forward
but
he
was
equally
unsuccessful
and
retired
looking
deeply
chagrined
the
third
knight
who
presented
himself
was
surrey
mounted
on
his
favourite
black
arabian
a
steed
which
though
of
fiery
temper
obeyed
his
slightest
movement
his
light
symmetrical
figure
was
seen
to
the
greatest
advantage
in
his
habiliments
of
silk
and
velvet
without
venturing
a
look
at
the
royal
balcony
the
earl
couched
his
lance
and
bounding
forward
bore
away
the
ring
on
its
point
amid
the
plaudits
of
the
spectators
he
then
careered
around
the
arena
and
approaching
the
royal
balcony
raised
his
lance
and
proffered
the
ring
to
the
fair
geraldine
who
blushingly
received
it
henry
though
by
no
means
pleased
with
surrey
success
earned
as
it
was
at
the
expense
of
his
son
complimented
him
upon
his
skill
and
anne
boleyn
joined
warmly
in
his
praises
the
lists
were
then
closed
and
the
royal
party
retired
to
partake
of
refreshments
after
which
they
proceeded
to
the
butts
erected
in
the
broad
mead
at
the
north
of
the
castle
where
the
duke
of
shoreditch
and
his
companions
shot
a
match
with
the
during
these
sports
surrey
placed
himself
as
near
as
he
could
to
the
fair
geraldine
and
though
but
few
opportunities
occurred
of
exchanging
a
syllable
with
her
his
looks
spoke
a
sufficiently
intelligible
language
at
last
just
as
they
were
about
to
return
to
the
palace
he
breathed
in
an
imploring
tone
in
her
ear
you
will
attend
vespers
at
saint
george
chapel
this
evening
return
through
the
cloisters
grant
me
a
moment
interview
alone
i
can
not
promise
replied
the
fair
geraldine
and
she
followed
in
the
train
of
the
lady
anne
the
earl
request
had
not
been
unheard
as
the
royal
train
proceeded
towards
the
castle
will
sommers
contrived
to
approach
the
duke
of
richmond
and
said
to
him
in
a
jeering
tone
you
ran
but
indifferently
at
the
ring
gossip
the
galliard
surrey
rode
better
and
carried
off
the
pest
on
thee
scurril
knave
be
silent
cried
richmond
angrily
failure
is
bad
enough
without
thy
if
you
had
only
missed
the
ring
gossip
i
should
have
thought
nothing
of
it
pursued
will
sommers
but
you
lost
a
golden
opportunity
of
ingratiating
yourself
with
your
all
your
hopes
are
now
at
an
end
a
word
in
your
ear
the
fair
geraldine
will
meet
surrey
alone
this
thou
liest
knave
cried
the
duke
fiercely
your
grace
will
find
the
contrary
if
you
will
be
at
at
replied
the
jester
i
will
be
there
replied
the
duke
but
if
i
am
brought
on
a
bootless
errand
not
even
my
royal
father
shall
save
thee
from
i
will
bear
any
chastisement
your
grace
may
choose
to
inflict
upon
me
if
i
prove
not
the
truth
of
my
assertion
replied
sommers
and
he
dropped
into
the
rear
of
the
train
the
two
friends
as
if
by
mutual
consent
avoided
each
other
during
the
rest
of
the
day
surrey
feeling
he
could
not
unburden
his
heart
to
richmond
and
richmond
brooding
jealously
over
the
intelligence
he
had
received
from
the
jester
at
the
appointed
hour
the
duke
proceeded
to
the
lower
ward
and
stationed
himself
near
wolsey
just
as
he
arrived
there
the
vesper
hymn
arose
from
the
adjoining
fane
and
its
solemn
strains
somewhat
soothed
his
troubled
spirit
but
they
died
away
and
as
the
jester
came
not
richmond
grew
impatient
and
began
to
fear
he
had
been
duped
by
his
informant
at
length
the
service
concluded
and
losing
all
patience
he
was
about
to
depart
when
the
jester
peered
round
the
lower
angle
of
the
and
beckoned
to
him
obeying
the
summons
the
duke
followed
his
conductor
down
the
arched
passage
leading
to
the
cloisters
tread
softly
gossip
or
you
will
alarm
them
said
sommers
in
a
low
tone
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
cloisters
and
there
near
the
entrance
of
the
chapel
stood
the
youthful
pair
the
fair
geraldine
half
reclining
upon
the
earl
breast
while
his
arm
encircled
her
slender
waist
there
whispered
the
jester
chuckling
maliciously
there
did
i
speak
falsely
eh
gossip
richmond
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
hist
said
the
jester
hear
what
the
fair
geraldine
has
to
we
must
meet
no
more
thus
surrey
she
murmured
i
feel
i
was
wrong
in
granting
the
interview
but
i
could
not
help
it
if
when
a
few
more
years
have
flown
over
your
head
your
heart
remains
it
will
never
change
interrupted
surrey
i
here
solemnly
pledge
my
troth
to
and
i
return
the
pledge
replied
the
fair
geraldine
earnestly
i
vow
to
be
yours
and
yours
would
that
richmond
could
hear
your
vow
said
surrey
it
would
extinguish
his

has
heard
it
cried
the
duke
advancing
but
his
hopes
are
not
yet
the
fair
geraldine
uttered
a
slight
scream
and
disengaged
herself
from
the
earl
richmond
you
have
acted
unworthily
in
thus
playing
the
spy
said
surrey
angrily
none
but
a
spy
can
surprise
interviews
like
these
rejoined
richmond
bitterly
the
lady
elizabeth
fitzgerald
had
better
have
kept
her
chamber
than
come
here
to
plight
her
troth
with
a
boy
who
will
change
his
mind
before
his
beard
is
your
grace
shall
find
the
boy
man
enough
to
avenge
an
insult
rejoined
surrey
sternly
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
returned
the
duke
lady
elizabeth
fitzgerald
i
must
pray
you
to
return
to
your
lodgings
the
king
jester
will
attend
you
this
way
my
too
much
exasperated
to
hesitate
surrey
followed
the
duke
down
the
passage
and
the
next
moment
the
clashing
of
swords
was
heard
the
fair
geraldine
screamed
loudly
and
will
sommers
began
to
think
the
jest
had
been
carried
too
far
what
is
to
be
done
he
cried
if
the
king
hears
of
this
quarrel
he
will
assuredly
place
the
earl
of
surrey
in
arrest
i
now
repent
having
brought
the
duke
you
acted
most
maliciously
cried
the
fair
geraldine
but
fly
and
prevent
further
thus
urged
the
jester
ran
towards
the
lower
ward
and
finding
an
officer
of
the
guard
and
a
couple
of
halberdiers
near
the
entrance
of
george
chapel
told
them
what
was
taking
place
and
they
immediately
hastened
with
him
to
the
scene
of
the
conflict
my
lords
cried
the
officer
to
the
combatants
i
command
you
to
lay
down
your
but
finding
no
respect
paid
to
his
injunctions
he
rushed
between
them
and
with
the
aid
of
the
halberdiers
forcibly
separated
them
my
lord
of
surrey
said
the
officer
you
are
my
prisoner
i
demand
your
on
what
plea
sir
rejoined
the
other
you
have
drawn
it
against
the
king
son
and
the
act
is
treason
replied
the
officer
i
shall
take
you
to
the
guard
house
until
the
king
pleasure
is
but
i
provoked
the
earl
to
the
conflict
said
richmond
i
was
the
your
grace
will
represent
the
matter
as
you
see
fit
to
your
royal
father
rejoined
the
officer
i
shall
fulfil
my
duty
my
lord
to
the
i
will
procure
your
instant
liberation
surrey
said
richmond
the
earl
was
then
led
away
and
conveyed
to
a
chamber
in
the
lower
part
of
henry
the
eighth
gate
now
used
as
a
place
of
military
punishment
and
denominated
the
black
viii
of
tristram
lyndwood
the
old
forester
and
his
daughter
mabel
of
the
peril
in
which
the
lady
anne
boleyn
was
placed
during
the
chase
and
by
whom
she
was
rescued
in
consequence
of
the
announcement
that
a
grand
hunting
party
would
be
held
in
the
forest
all
the
verderers
rangers
and
keepers
assembled
at
an
early
hour
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
king
arrival
at
windsor
in
an
open
space
on
the
west
side
of
the
great
avenue
where
a
wooden
stand
was
erected
canopied
over
with
green
boughs
and
festooned
with
garlands
of
flowers
for
the
accommodation
of
the
lady
anne
boleyn
and
her
dames
who
it
was
understood
would
be
present
at
the
chase
at
a
little
distance
from
the
stand
an
extensive
covert
was
fenced
round
with
stout
poles
to
which
nets
were
attached
so
as
to
form
a
haye
or
preserve
where
the
game
intended
for
the
royal
sport
was
confined
and
though
many
of
the
animals
thus
brought
together
were
of
hostile
natures
they
were
all
so
terrified
and
seemingly
so
conscious
of
the
danger
impending
over
them
that
they
did
not
molest
each
other
the
foxes
and
martins
of
which
there
were
abundance
slunk
into
the
brushwood
with
the
hares
and
rabbits
but
left
their
prey
untouched
the
harts
made
violent
efforts
to
break
forth
and
entangling
their
horns
in
the
nets
were
with
difficulty
extricated
and
driven
back
while
the
timid
does
not
daring
to
follow
them
stood
warily
watching
the
result
of
the
struggle
amongst
the
antlered
captives
was
a
fine
buck
which
having
been
once
before
hunted
by
the
king
was
styled
a
hart
royal
and
this
noble
animal
would
certainly
have
effected
his
escape
if
he
had
not
been
attacked
and
driven
back
by
morgan
fenwolf
who
throughout
the
proceedings
displayed
great
energy
and
skill
the
compliments
bestowed
on
fenwolf
for
his
address
by
the
chief
verderer
excited
the
jealousy
of
some
of
his
comrades
and
more
than
one
asserted
that
he
had
been
assisted
in
his
task
by
some
evil
being
and
that
bawsey
herself
was
no
better
than
a
familiar
spirit
in
the
form
of
a
hound
morgan
fenwolf
scouted
these
remarks
and
he
was
supported
by
some
others
among
the
keepers
who
declared
that
it
required
no
supernatural
aid
to
accomplish
what
he
had
done
that
he
was
nothing
more
than
a
good
huntsman
who
could
ride
fast
and
boldly
that
he
was
skilled
in
all
the
exercises
of
the
chase
and
possessed
a
stanch
and
hound
the
party
then
sat
down
to
breakfast
beneath
the
trees
and
the
talk
fell
upon
herne
the
hunter
and
his
frequent
appearance
of
late
in
the
forest
for
most
of
the
keepers
had
heard
of
or
encountered
the
spectral
huntsman
and
while
they
were
discussing
this
topic
and
a
plentiful
allowance
of
cold
meat
bread
ale
and
mead
at
the
same
time
two
persons
were
seen
approaching
along
a
vista
on
the
right
who
specially
attracted
their
attention
and
caused
morgan
fenwolf
to
drop
the
with
which
he
was
carving
his
viands
and
start
to
his
feet
the
were
an
old
man
and
a
comely
young
damsel
the
former
though
nearer
seventy
than
sixty
was
still
hale
and
athletic
with
fresh
complexion
somewhat
tanned
by
the
sun
and
a
keen
grey
eye
which
had
lost
nothing
of
its
fire
he
was
habited
in
a
stout
leathern
doublet
hose
of
the
same
material
and
boots
rudely
fashioned
out
of
untanned
and
drawn
above
the
knee
in
his
girdle
was
thrust
a
large
a
horn
with
a
silver
mouthpiece
depended
from
his
shoulder
and
he
wore
a
long
bow
and
a
quiver
full
of
arrows
at
his
back
a
flat
bonnet
made
of
and
ornamented
with
a
wing
covered
his
hair
which
was
as
white
as
silver
but
it
was
not
upon
this
old
forester
for
such
his
attire
proclaimed
him
that
the
attention
of
the
beholders
and
of
morgan
fenwolf
in
especial
was
fixed
but
upon
his
companion
amongst
the
many
lovely
and
dames
who
had
so
recently
graced
the
procession
to
the
castle
were
few
if
any
comparable
to
this
lowly
damsel
her
dress
probably
owing
to
the
pride
felt
in
her
by
her
old
relative
was
somewhat
superior
to
her
station
a
green
kirtle
displayed
to
perfection
her
slight
but
figure
a
gown
of
cloth
sufficiently
short
to
display
her
small
ankles
and
a
pair
of
green
buskins
embroidered
with
silver
together
with
a
collar
of
the
whitest
and
finest
linen
though
shamed
by
the
neck
it
concealed
and
fastened
by
a
small
clasp
completed
her
attire
her
girdle
was
embroidered
with
silver
and
her
sleeves
were
fastened
by
aiglets
of
the
same
metal
how
proud
old
tristram
lyndwood
seems
of
his
granddaughter
remarked
one
of
the
keepers
and
with
reason
replied
another
mabel
lyndwood
is
the
comeliest
lass
in
ay
marry
is
she
rejoined
the
first
speaker
and
to
my
thinking
she
is
a
fairer
and
sweeter
flower
than
any
that
blooms
in
yon
stately
castle
the
flower
that
finds
so
much
favour
in
the
eyes
of
our
royal
hal
not
have
a
care
gabriel
lapp
observed
another
keeper
recollect
that
mark
fytton
the
butcher
was
hanged
for
speaking
slightingly
of
the
lady
anne
boleyn
and
you
may
share
his
fate
if
you
disparage
her
na
i
meant
not
to
disparage
the
lady
anne
replied
gabriel
hal
may
marry
her
when
he
will
and
divorce
her
as
soon
afterwards
as
he
pleases
for
aught
i
care
if
he
marries
fifty
wives
i
shall
like
him
all
the
better
the
more
the
merrier
say
i
but
if
he
sets
eyes
on
mab
lyndwood
it
may
somewhat
unsettle
his
love
for
the
lady
tush
gabriel
said
morgan
fenwolf
darting
an
angry
look
at
him
what
business
have
you
to
insinuate
that
the
king
would
heed
other
than
the
lady
of
his
love
you
are
jealous
morgan
fenwolf
rejoined
gabriel
with
a
malignant
grin
we
all
know
you
are
in
love
with
mabel
and
we
all
know
likewise
that
mabel
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
cried
another
keeper
while
the
others
laughed
in
chorus
come
and
sit
down
beside
us
morgan
and
finish
your
but
the
keeper
turned
moodily
away
and
hied
towards
tristram
lyndwood
and
his
granddaughter
the
old
forester
shook
him
cordially
by
the
hand
and
after
questioning
him
as
to
what
had
taken
place
and
hearing
how
he
had
managed
to
drive
the
hart
royal
into
the
haye
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
said
thou
art
a
brave
huntsman
morgan
i
wish
mab
could
only
think
as
well
of
thee
as
i
to
this
speech
mabel
not
only
paid
no
attention
but
looked
studiously
another
way
i
am
glad
your
grandfather
has
brought
you
out
to
see
the
chase
mabel
observed
morgan
fenwolf
i
dame
not
to
see
the
chase
but
the
king
she
replied
somewhat
petulantly
it
is
not
every
fair
maid
who
would
confess
so
much
observed
fenwolf
frowning
then
i
am
franker
than
some
of
my
sex
replied
mabel
but
who
is
the
strange
man
looking
at
us
from
behind
that
tree
grandfather
i
see
no
one
replied
the
old
forester
neither
do
i
added
morgan
fenwolf
with
a
shudder
you
are
wilfully
blind
rejoined
mabel
but
see
the
person
i
mentioned
stalks
forth
now
perhaps
he
is
visible
to
you
and
as
she
spoke
a
tall
figure
armed
with
a
emerged
from
the
trees
and
advanced
towards
them
the
garb
of
the
newcomer
somewhat
resembled
that
of
a
forester
but
his
arms
and
lower
limbs
were
destitute
of
covering
and
appeared
singularly
muscular
while
his
skin
was
swarthy
as
that
of
a
gipsy
his
hair
hung
in
over
his
features
in
another
moment
he
was
beside
them
and
fixed
his
dark
piercing
eyes
on
mabel
in
such
a
manner
as
to
compel
her
to
avert
her
gaze
what
brings
you
here
this
morning
tristram
lyndwood
he
demanded
in
a
hoarse
imperious
tone
the
same
motive
that
brought
you
valentine
hagthorne
replied
the
old
forester
to
see
the
royal
this
i
suppose
is
your
granddaughter
pursued
hagthorne
ay
replied
tristram
bluntly
strange
i
should
never
have
seen
her
before
rejoined
the
other
she
is
very
fair
be
ruled
by
me
friend
tristram
take
her
home
again
if
she
sees
the
king
ill
will
come
of
it
you
know
or
should
know
his
hagthorne
advises
well
interposed
fenwolf
mabel
will
be
better
at
but
she
has
no
intention
of
returning
at
present
replied
mabel
you
brought
me
here
for
pastime
dear
grandfather
and
will
not
take
me
back
at
the
recommendation
of
this
strange
man
content
you
child
content
you
replied
tristram
kindly
you
shall
remain
where
you
you
will
repent
it
cried
hagthorne
and
hastily
darting
among
the
trees
he
disappeared
from
view
affecting
to
laugh
at
the
occurrence
though
evidently
annoyed
by
it
the
old
forester
led
his
granddaughter
towards
the
stand
where
he
was
cordially
greeted
by
the
keepers
most
of
whom
while
expressing
their
pleasure
at
seeing
him
strove
to
render
themselves
agreeable
in
the
eyes
of
mabel
from
this
scene
morgan
fenwolf
kept
aloof
and
remained
leaning
against
a
tree
with
his
eyes
riveted
upon
the
damsel
he
was
roused
from
his
reverie
by
a
slight
tap
upon
the
shoulder
and
turning
at
the
touch
beheld
valentine
hagthorne
obedient
to
a
sign
from
the
latter
he
followed
him
amongst
the
trees
and
they
both
plunged
into
a
dell
an
hour
or
two
after
this
when
the
sun
was
higher
in
the
heavens
and
the
dew
dried
upon
the
greensward
the
king
and
a
large
company
of
lords
and
ladies
rode
forth
from
the
upper
gate
of
the
castle
and
taking
their
way
along
the
great
avenue
struck
off
on
the
right
when
about
up
it
and
shaped
their
course
towards
the
haye
a
goodly
sight
it
was
to
see
this
gallant
company
riding
beneath
the
trees
and
pleasant
was
it
also
to
listen
to
the
blithe
sound
of
their
voices
amid
which
anne
boleyn
musical
laugh
could
be
plainly
distinguished
henry
was
attended
by
his
customary
band
of
archers
and
yeomen
of
the
guard
and
by
the
duke
of
shoreditch
and
his
followers
on
reaching
the
haye
the
king
dismounted
and
assisting
the
lady
anne
from
her
steed
ascended
the
stand
with
her
he
then
took
a
small
and
beautifully
fashioned
bow
from
an
attendant
and
stringing
it
presented
it
to
her
i
trust
this
will
not
prove
too
strong
for
your
fair
hands
he
said
i
will
make
shift
to
draw
it
replied
anne
raising
the
bow
and
gracefully
pulling
the
string
would
i
could
wound
your
majesty
as
surely
as
i
shall
hit
the
first
roe
that
that
were
a
needless
labour
rejoined
henry
seeing
that
you
have
already
stricken
me
to
the
heart
you
should
cure
the
wound
you
have
already
made
inflict
a
new
at
this
juncture
the
chief
verderer
mounted
on
a
powerful
steed
and
followed
by
two
keepers
each
holding
a
couple
of
in
leash
rode
up
to
the
royal
stand
and
placing
his
horn
to
his
lips
blew
three
long
mootes
from
it
at
the
same
moment
part
of
the
network
of
the
haye
was
lifted
up
and
a
roebuck
set
free
by
the
management
of
the
keepers
the
animal
was
driven
past
the
royal
stand
and
anne
boleyn
who
had
drawn
an
arrow
nearly
to
the
head
let
it
fly
with
such
good
aim
that
she
pierced
the
buck
to
the
heart
a
loud
shout
from
the
spectators
rewarded
the
prowess
of
the
fair
huntress
and
henry
was
so
enchanted
that
he
bent
the
knee
to
her
and
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
satisfied
however
with
the
achievement
anne
prudently
declined
another
shot
henry
then
took
a
bow
from
one
of
the
archers
and
other
roes
being
turned
out
he
approved
upon
them
his
unerring
skill
as
a
marksman
meanwhile
the
hounds
being
held
in
leash
kept
up
a
loud
and
incessant
baying
and
henry
wearying
of
his
slaughterous
sport
turned
to
anne
and
asked
her
whether
she
was
disposed
for
the
chase
she
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
the
king
motioned
his
henchmen
to
bring
forward
the
steeds
in
doing
this
he
caught
sight
of
mabel
who
was
standing
with
her
grandsire
among
the
keepers
at
a
little
distance
from
the
stand
and
struck
with
her
extraordinary
beauty
he
regarded
her
for
a
moment
intently
and
then
called
to
gabriel
lapp
who
chanced
to
be
near
him
and
demanded
her
name
it
is
mabel
lyndwood
a
please
your
majesty
replied
gabriel
she
is
granddaughter
to
old
tristram
lyndwood
who
dwells
at
black
nest
near
the
lake
at
the
farther
extremity
of
windsor
forest
and
who
was
forester
to
your
royal
father
king
henry
the
seventh
of
blessed
ha
is
it
so
cried
henry
but
he
was
prevented
from
further
remark
by
anne
boleyn
who
perceiving
how
his
attention
was
attracted
suddenly
interposed
your
majesty
spoke
of
the
chase
she
said
impatiently
but
perhaps
you
have
found
other
pastime
more
diverting
not
so
not
so
sweetheart
he
replied
hastily
there
is
a
hart
royal
in
the
haye
said
gabriel
lapp
is
it
your
majesty
pleasure
that
i
set
him
free
it
is
good
fellow
it
is
replied
the
king
and
as
gabriel
hastened
to
the
netted
fencework
and
prepared
to
drive
forth
the
hart
henry
assisted
anne
boleyn
who
could
not
help
exhibiting
some
slight
jealous
pique
to
mount
her
steed
and
having
sprung
into
his
own
saddle
they
waited
the
liberation
of
the
buck
which
was
accomplished
in
a
somewhat
unexpected
manner
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
herd
the
noble
animal
made
a
sudden
dart
towards
gabriel
and
upsetting
him
in
his
wild
career
darted
past
the
king
and
made
towards
the
upper
part
of
the
forest
in
another
instant
the
hounds
were
un
coupled
and
at
his
heels
while
henry
and
anne
urged
their
steeds
after
him
the
king
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
lusty
voice
the
rest
of
the
royal
party
followed
as
they
might
and
the
woods
resounded
with
their
joyous
cries
the
hart
royal
proved
himself
worthy
of
his
designation
dashing
forward
with
extraordinary
swiftness
he
rapidly
gained
upon
his
pursuers
for
though
henry
by
putting
his
courser
to
his
utmost
speed
could
have
kept
near
him
he
did
not
choose
to
quit
his
fair
companion
in
this
way
they
scoured
the
forest
until
the
king
seeing
they
should
be
speedily
distanced
commanded
sir
thomas
wyat
who
with
the
dukes
of
suffolk
and
norfolk
was
riding
close
behind
him
to
cross
by
the
lower
ground
on
the
left
and
turn
the
stag
wyat
instantly
obeyed
and
plunging
his
spurs
deeply
into
his
horse
sides
started
off
at
a
furious
pace
and
was
soon
after
seen
shaping
his
rapid
course
through
a
devious
glade
meanwhile
henry
and
his
fair
companion
rode
on
without
relaxing
their
pace
until
they
reached
the
summit
of
a
knoll
crowned
by
an
old
oak
and
and
commanding
a
superb
view
of
the
castle
where
they
drew
in
the
rein
from
this
eminence
they
could
witness
the
progress
of
the
chase
as
it
continued
in
the
valley
beyond
an
ardent
lover
of
hunting
the
king
watched
it
with
the
deepest
interest
rose
in
his
saddle
and
uttering
various
exclamations
showed
from
his
impatience
that
he
was
only
restrained
by
the
stronger
passion
of
love
from
joining
it
ere
long
stag
hounds
and
huntsmen
were
lost
amid
a
thicket
and
nothing
could
be
distinguished
but
a
distant
baying
and
shouts
at
last
even
these
sounds
died
away
henry
who
had
ill
brooked
the
previous
restraint
now
grew
so
impatient
that
anne
begged
him
to
set
off
after
them
when
suddenly
the
cry
of
hounds
burst
upon
their
ears
and
the
hart
was
seen
issuing
from
the
dell
closely
followed
by
his
pursuers
the
affrighted
animal
to
the
king
great
satisfaction
made
his
way
directly
towards
the
spot
where
he
was
stationed
but
on
reaching
the
side
of
the
knoll
and
seeing
his
new
foes
he
darted
off
on
the
right
and
tried
to
regain
the
thicket
below
but
he
was
turned
by
another
band
of
keepers
and
again
driven
towards
the
knoll
scarcely
had
sir
thomas
wyat
reined
in
his
steed
by
the
side
of
the
king
than
the
hart
again
appeared
bounding
up
the
hill
anne
boleyn
who
had
turned
her
horse
head
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
the
hunt
alarmed
by
the
animal
menacing
appearance
tried
to
get
out
of
his
way
but
it
was
too
late
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
and
driven
to
desperation
by
the
cries
of
hounds
and
huntsmen
in
front
the
hart
lowered
his
horns
and
made
a
furious
push
at
her
dreadfully
alarmed
anne
drew
in
the
rein
so
suddenly
and
sharply
that
she
almost
pulled
her
steed
back
upon
his
haunches
and
in
trying
to
avoid
the
stag
attack
caught
hold
of
sir
thomas
wyat
who
was
close
beside
her
in
all
probability
she
would
have
received
some
serious
injury
from
the
infuriated
animal
who
was
just
about
to
repeat
his
assault
and
more
successfully
when
a
bolt
from
a
discharged
by
morgan
fenwolf
who
suddenly
made
his
appearance
from
behind
the
brought
him
to
the
ground
but
anne
boleyn
escaped
one
danger
only
to
encounter
another
equally
serious
on
seeing
her
fling
herself
into
the
arms
of
sir
thomas
wyat
henry
regarded
her
in
stern
displeasure
for
a
moment
and
then
calling
angrily
to
his
train
without
so
much
as
deigning
to
inquire
whether
she
had
sustained
any
damage
from
the
accident
or
making
the
slightest
remark
upon
her
conduct
rode
sullenly
towards
the
castle
ix
by
what
means
sir
thomas
wyat
obtained
an
interview
with
anne
boleyn
and
how
the
earl
of
surrey
saved
them
from
the
king
anger
the
incident
above
related
gave
new
life
to
the
adherents
of
catherine
of
arragon
while
it
filled
those
devoted
to
anne
boleyn
with
alarm
immediately
on
anne
return
to
the
castle
lord
rochford
had
a
private
interview
with
her
and
bitterly
reproached
her
for
endangering
her
splendid
prospects
anne
treated
the
matter
very
lightly
said
it
was
only
a
temporary
gust
of
jealousy
and
added
that
the
king
would
be
at
her
feet
again
before
the
day
was
past
you
are
mistress
cried
rochford
angrily
henry
is
not
an
ordinary
it
is
you
who
are
mistaken
father
replied
anne
the
king
differs
in
no
respect
from
any
of
his
subjects
i
have
him
in
my
toils
and
will
not
let
him
you
have
a
tiger
in
your
toils
daughter
and
take
heed
he
breaks
not
forcibly
through
them
rejoined
rochford
henry
is
more
wayward
than
you
suppose
him
once
let
him
take
up
a
notion
and
nothing
can
shake
him
from
it
he
has
resolved
upon
the
divorce
as
much
from
as
from
any
other
consideration
if
you
regain
your
position
with
him
of
which
you
seem
so
confident
do
not
consider
yourself
secure
not
even
when
you
are
crowned
queen
but
be
warned
by
catherine
of
catherine
has
not
the
art
to
retain
him
said
anne
henry
will
never
divorce
take
care
he
does
not
rid
himself
of
you
in
a
more
summary
manner
daughter
rejoined
rochford
if
you
would
stand
well
with
him
you
must
study
his
lightest
word
look
and
action
humour
him
in
every
whim
and
yield
to
every
caprice
above
all
you
must
exhibit
no
you
are
wrong
in
all
but
the
last
father
returned
anne
henry
is
not
to
be
pleased
by
such
nice
attention
to
his
humours
it
is
because
i
have
shown
myself
careless
of
them
that
i
have
captivated
him
but
i
will
take
care
not
to
exhibit
jealousy
and
sooth
to
say
i
do
not
think
i
shall
have
be
not
too
sure
of
that
replied
rochford
and
at
all
events
let
not
the
king
have
cause
to
be
jealous
of
you
i
trust
wyat
will
be
banished
from
court
but
if
he
is
not
do
not
let
him
approach
you
poor
sir
thomas
sighed
anne
he
loved
me
very
but
what
is
his
love
compared
to
the
king
cried
rochford
tut
tut
girl
think
no
more
of
i
will
not
my
lord
she
rejoined
i
see
the
prudence
of
your
counsel
and
will
obey
it
leave
me
i
pray
you
i
will
soon
win
back
the
affections
of
the
no
sooner
had
rochford
quitted
the
chamber
than
the
arras
at
the
farther
end
was
raised
and
wyat
stepped
from
behind
it
his
first
proceeding
was
to
bar
the
door
what
means
this
sir
thomas
cried
anne
in
alarm
how
have
you
obtained
admittance
here
through
the
secret
staircase
replied
wyat
bending
the
knee
before
her
rise
sir
cried
anne
in
great
alarm
return
i
beseech
you
as
you
came
you
have
greatly
endangered
me
by
coming
here
if
you
are
seen
to
leave
this
chamber
it
will
be
in
vain
to
assert
my
innocence
to
henry
oh
sir
thomas
you
can
not
love
me
or
you
would
not
have
done
not
love
you
anne
he
repeated
bitterly
not
love
you
i
words
can
not
speak
my
devotion
i
would
lay
down
my
head
on
the
scaffold
to
prove
it
but
for
my
love
for
you
i
would
throw
open
that
door
and
walk
forth
so
that
all
might
see
me
so
that
henry
might
experience
some
part
of
the
anguish
i
now
but
you
will
not
do
so
good
sir
thomas
dear
sir
thomas
cried
anne
boleyn
in
alarm
have
no
fear
rejoined
wyat
with
some
contempt
i
will
sacrifice
even
vengeance
to
sir
thomas
i
had
tolerated
this
too
long
said
anne
begone
you
terrify
it
is
my
last
interview
with
you
anne
said
wyat
imploringly
do
not
abridge
it
oh
bethink
you
of
the
happy
hours
we
have
passed
together
of
the
vows
we
have
interchanged
of
the
protestations
you
have
listened
to
and
returned
ay
returned
anne
are
all
these
forgotten
not
forgotten
sir
thomas
replied
anne
mournfully
but
they
must
not
be
recalled
i
can
not
listen
to
you
longer
you
must
go
heaven
grant
you
may
get
hence
in
safety
anne
replied
wyat
in
a
sombre
tone
the
thought
of
henry
happiness
drives
me
mad
i
feel
that
i
am
grown
a
traitor
that
i
could
slay
sir
thomas
she
exclaimed
in
mingled
fear
and
anger
i
will
not
go
he
continued
flinging
himself
into
a
seat
let
them
put
what
construction
they
will
upon
my
presence
i
shall
at
least
wring
henry
heart
i
shall
see
him
suffer
as
i
have
suffered
and
i
shall
be
this
is
not
like
you
wyat
cried
anne
in
great
alarm
you
were
wont
to
be
noble
generous
kind
you
will
not
act
thus
disloyally
who
has
acted
disloyally
anne
cried
wyat
springing
to
his
feet
and
fixing
his
dark
eyes
blazing
with
jealous
fury
upon
her
you
or
i
have
you
not
sacrificed
your
old
affections
at
the
shrine
of
ambition
are
you
not
about
to
give
yourself
to
one
to
whom
unless
you
are
foresworn
you
can
not
give
your
heart
better
had
you
been
the
mistress
of
allington
castle
better
the
wife
of
a
humble
knight
like
myself
than
the
queen
of
the
ruthless
no
more
of
this
wyat
said
anne
better
far
you
should
perish
by
his
tyranny
for
a
supposed
fault
now
than
hereafter
pursued
wyat
fiercely
think
not
henry
will
respect
you
more
than
her
who
had
been
years
his
wife
no
when
he
is
tired
of
your
charms
when
some
other
dame
fair
as
yourself
shall
enslave
his
fancy
he
will
cast
you
off
or
as
your
father
truly
intimated
will
seek
a
readier
means
of
ridding
himself
of
you
then
you
will
think
of
the
different
fate
that
might
have
been
yours
if
you
had
adhered
to
your
early
wyat
wyat
i
can
not
bear
this
in
mercy
spare
me
cried
anne
i
am
glad
to
see
you
weep
said
wyat
your
tears
make
you
look
more
like
your
former
oh
wyat
do
not
view
my
conduct
too
harshly
she
said
few
of
my
sex
would
have
acted
other
than
i
have
i
do
not
think
so
replied
wyat
sternly
nor
will
i
forego
my
vengeance
anne
you
shall
die
you
know
henry
too
well
to
doubt
your
fate
if
he
finds
me
you
can
not
mean
this
she
rejoined
with
difficulty
repressing
a
scream
but
if
i
perish
you
will
perish
with
i
wish
to
do
so
he
rejoined
with
a
bitter
laugh
wyat
cried
anne
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
before
him
by
your
former
love
for
me
i
implore
you
to
spare
me
do
not
disgrace
me
but
wyat
continued
inexorable
o
god
exclaimed
anne
wringing
her
hands
in
agony
a
terrible
silence
ensued
during
which
anne
regarded
wyat
but
she
could
discern
no
change
in
his
countenance
at
this
juncture
the
tapestry
was
again
raised
and
the
earl
of
surrey
issued
from
it
you
here
my
lord
said
anne
rushing
towards
him
i
am
come
to
save
you
madame
said
the
earl
i
have
been
just
liberated
from
arrest
and
was
about
to
implore
your
intercession
with
the
king
when
i
learned
he
had
been
informed
by
one
of
his
pages
that
a
man
was
in
your
chamber
luckily
he
knows
not
who
it
is
and
while
he
was
summoning
his
attendants
to
accompany
him
i
hurried
hither
by
the
secret
staircase
i
have
arrived
in
time
fly
fly
sir
thomas
wyat
but
wyat
moved
not
at
this
moment
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
the
door
the
handle
was
tried
and
the
stern
voice
of
the
king
was
heard
commanding
that
it
might
be
opened
will
you
destroy
me
wyat
cried
anne
you
have
destroyed
yourself
he
rejoined
why
stay
you
here
sir
thomas
said
surrey
seizing
his
arm
you
may
yet
escape
by
heaven
if
you
move
not
i
will
stab
you
to
the
heart
you
would
do
me
a
favour
young
man
said
wyat
coldly
but
i
will
go
i
yield
to
love
and
not
to
you
tyrant
he
added
shaking
his
hand
at
the
door
may
the
worst
pangs
of
jealously
rend
your
heart
and
he
disappeared
behind
the
arras
i
hear
voices
cried
henry
from
without
god
death
madam
open
the
door
or
i
will
burst
it
open
oh
heaven
what
is
to
be
done
cried
anne
boleyn
in
despair
open
the
door
and
leave
all
to
me
madam
said
surrey
i
will
save
you
though
it
cost
me
my
life
anne
pressed
his
hand
with
a
look
of
ineffable
gratitude
and
surrey
concealed
himself
behind
the
arras
the
door
was
opened
and
henry
rushed
in
followed
by
richmond
norfolk
suffolk
and
a
host
of
attendants
ah
god
death
where
is
the
traitor
roared
the
king
gazing
round
why
is
my
privacy
thus
broken
upon
said
anne
assuming
a
look
of
indignation
your
privacy
echoed
henry
in
a
tone
of
deep
derision
your
privacy
ha
ha
you
bear
yourself
bravely
it
must
be
confessed
my
lords
you
heard
the
voices
as
well
as
myself
where
is
sir
thomas
wyat
he
is
not
here
replied
anne
firmly
aha
we
shall
see
that
mistress
rejoined
henry
fiercely
but
if
sir
thomas
wyat
is
not
here
who
is
for
i
am
well
assured
that
some
one
is
hidden
in
your
what
if
there
be
rejoined
anne
coldly
ah
by
saint
mary
you
confess
it
cried
the
king
let
the
traitor
come
your
majesty
shall
not
need
to
bid
twice
said
surrey
issuing
from
his
concealment
the
earl
of
surrey
exclaimed
henry
in
surprise
how
come
you
here
my
lord
methought
you
were
under
arrest
at
the
he
was
set
free
by
my
orders
said
the
duke
of
richmond
first
of
all
i
must
entreat
your
majesty
to
turn
your
resentment
against
me
said
the
earl
i
am
solely
to
blame
and
i
would
not
have
the
lady
anne
suffer
for
my
fault
i
forced
myself
into
her
presence
she
knew
not
of
my
and
wherefore
did
you
so
my
lord
demanded
henry
sternly
liberated
from
the
at
the
duke
of
richmond
instance
my
liege
i
came
to
entreat
the
lady
anne
to
mediate
between
me
and
your
majesty
and
to
use
her
influence
with
your
highness
to
have
me
betrothed
to
the
lady
elizabeth
is
this
so
madam
asked
the
king
anne
bowed
her
head
but
why
was
the
door
barred
demanded
henry
again
frowning
suspiciously
i
barred
it
myself
said
surrey
and
vowed
that
the
lady
anne
should
not
go
forth
till
she
had
granted
my
by
our
lady
you
have
placed
yourself
in
peril
my
lord
said
henry
sternly
your
majesty
will
bear
in
mind
his
youth
said
the
duke
of
norfolk
anxiously
for
my
sake
overlook
the
indiscretion
cried
the
duke
of
richmond
it
will
not
perhaps
avail
him
to
hope
that
it
may
be
overlooked
for
mine
added
anne
boleyn
the
offence
must
not
pass
unpunished
said
henry
musingly
my
lord
of
surrey
you
must
be
content
to
remain
for
two
months
a
prisoner
in
the
round
tower
of
this
your
majesty
cried
richmond
bending
the
knee
in
supplication
the
sentence
is
passed
replied
henry
coldly
and
the
earl
may
thank
you
it
is
not
heavier
richmond
you
will
think
no
more
of
the
fair
geraldine
and
it
is
my
pleasure
lady
anne
that
the
young
dame
withdraw
from
the
court
for
a
short

said
anne
but

the
king
peremptorily
explanation

satisfactory
so
far
as
it
goes
but
i
was
told

thomas
wyat
was
sir
thomas
wyat
is
here
said
will
sommers
pointing
out
the
knight
who
had
just
joined
the
throng
of
courtiers
at
the
door
i
have
hurried
hither
from
my
chamber
my
liege
said
wyat
stepping
forward
hearing
there
was
some
inquiry
concerning
is
your
majesty
now
satisfied
asked
anne
boleyn
why
ay
sweetheart
well
enough
rejoined
henry
sir
thomas
wyat
we
have
a
special
mission
for
you
to
the
court
of
our
brother
of
france
you
will
set
out
wyat
bowed
you
have
saved
your
head
gossip
whispered
will
sommers
in
the
knight
ear
a
visit
to
francis
the
first
is
better
than
a
visit
to
the
retire
my
lords
said
henry
to
the
assemblage
we
owe
some
apology
to
the
lady
anne
for
our
intrusion
and
desire
an
opportunity
to
make
upon
this
the
chamber
was
instantly
cleared
of
its
occupants
and
the
earl
of
surrey
was
conducted
under
a
guard
to
the
round
tower
henry
however
did
not
find
it
an
easy
matter
to
make
peace
with
the
lady
anne
conscious
of
the
advantage
she
had
gained
she
determined
not
to
relinquish
it
and
after
half
an
hour
vain
suing
her
royal
lover
proposed
a
turn
in
the
long
gallery
upon
which
her
apartments
opened
here
they
continued
conversing
henry
pleading
in
the
most
passionate
manner
and
anne
maintaining
a
show
of
offended
pride
at
last
she
exhibited
some
signs
of
relenting
and
henry
led
her
into
a
recess
in
the
gallery
lighted
by
a
window
filled
with
magnificent
stained
glass
in
this
recess
was
a
seat
and
a
small
table
on
which
stood
a
vase
filled
with
flowers
arranged
by
anne
own
hand
and
here
the
monarch
hoped
to
adjust
his
differences
with
her
meanwhile
word
having
reached
wolsey
and
campeggio
of
the
new
cause
of
jealousy
which
the
king
had
received
it
was
instantly
resolved
that
the
former
should
present
to
him
while
in
his
present
favourable
mood
a
despatch
received
that
morning
from
catherine
of
arragon
armed
with
the
letter
wolsey
repaired
to
the
king
closet
not
finding
him
there
and
being
given
to
understand
by
an
usher
that
he
was
in
the
great
gallery
he
proceeded
thither
as
he
walked
softly
along
the
polished
oak
floor
he
heard
voices
in
one
of
the
recesses
and
distinguished
the
tones
of
henry
and
anne
boleyn
henry
was
clasping
the
snowy
fingers
of
his
favourite
and
gazing
passionately
at
her
as
the
cardinal
approached
your
majesty
shall
not
detain
my
hand
said
anne
unless
you
swear
to
me
by
your
crown
that
you
will
not
again
be
jealous
without
i
swear
it
replied
henry
were
your
majesty
as
devoted
to
me
as
you
would
have
me
believe
you
would
soon
bring
this
matter
of
the
divorce
to
an
issue
said
anne
i
would
fain
do
so
sweetheart
rejoined
henry
but
these
cardinals
perplex
me
i
am
told
by
one
who
overheard
him
that
wolsey
has
declared
the
divorce
shall
not
be
settled
these
two
years
said
anne
in
which
case
it
had
better
not
be
settled
at
all
for
i
care
not
to
avow
i
can
not
brook
so
much
delay
the
warmth
of
my
affection
will
grow
icy
cold
by
that
it
were
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
the
most
forbearing
rejoined
the
king
smiling
but
it
shall
not
be
so
by
this
lily
hand
it
shall
not
and
now
sweetheart
are
we
entirely
reconciled
not
yet
replied
anne
i
shall
claim
a
boon
from
your
majesty
before
i
accord
my
entire
name
it
said
the
king
still
clasping
her
hand
tenderly
and
intoxicated
by
the
witchery
of
her
glance
i
ask
an
important
favour
said
anne
but
as
it
is
one
which
will
benefit
your
majesty
as
much
as
myself
i
have
the
less
scruple
in
requesting
it
i
ask
the
dismissal
of
one
who
has
abused
your
favour
who
by
his
extortion
and
rapacity
has
in
some
degree
alienated
the
affections
of
your
subjects
from
you
and
who
solely
opposes
your
divorce
from
catherine
of
arragon
because
he
fears
my
influence
may
be
prejudicial
to
you
can
not
mean
wolsey
said
henry
uneasily
your
majesty
has
guessed
aright
replied
anne
wolsey
has
incurred
my
displeasure
oft
of
late
said
henry
and
yet
his
fidelity
be
not
deceived
my
liege
said
anne
he
is
faithful
to
you
only
so
far
as
serves
his
turn
he
thinks
he
rules
before
henry
could
reply
the
cardinal
stepped
forward
i
bring
your
majesty
a
despatch
just
received
from
the
queen
he
said
and
you
have
been
listening
to
our
discourse
rejoined
henry
sternly
you
have
overheard
enough
to
convince
me
if
i
had
previously
doubted
it
that
the
lady
anne
boleyn
is
my
mortal
foe
replied
wolsey
foe
though
i
am
i
will
make
terms
with
your
eminence
said
anne
expedite
the
divorce
you
can
do
so
if
you
will
and
i
am
your
fast
i
know
too
well
the
value
of
your
friendship
noble
lady
not
to
do
all
in
my
power
to
gain
it
replied
wolsey
i
will
further
the
matter
if
possible
but
it
rests
chiefly
in
the
hands
of
his
holiness
pope
clement
the
if
his
majesty
will
listen
to
my
counsel
he
will
throw
off
the
yoke
altogether
rejoined
anne
nay
your
eminence
may
frown
at
me
if
you
will
such
i
repeat
shall
be
my
counsel
if
the
divorce
is
speedily
obtained
i
am
your
friend
if
not
look
to
do
not
appeal
to
me
wolsey
said
henry
smiling
approval
at
anne
i
shall
uphold
will
it
please
your
majesty
to
peruse
this
despatch
said
wolsey
again
offering
catherine
letter
take
it
to
my
closet
replied
the
king
i
will
join
you
there
and
now
at
last
we
are
good
friends
excellent
friends
my
dear
liege
replied
anne
but
i
shall
never
be
your
queen
while
wolsey
holds
his
then
indeed
he
shall
lose
it
replied
henry
she
is
a
bitter
enemy
certes
muttered
wolsey
as
he
walked
away
i
must
overthrow
her
quickly
or
she
will
overthrow
me
a
rival
must
be
found
ay
a
rival
but
where
i
was
told
that
henry
cast
eyes
on
a
comely
forester
daughter
at
the
chase
this
morning
she
may
do
for
the
x
of
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
herne
the
hunter
in
the
lake
unable
to
procure
any
mitigation
of
surrey
sentence
the
duke
of
richmond
proceeded
to
the
round
tower
where
he
found
his
friend
in
a
small
chamber
endeavouring
to
beguile
his
captivity
by
study
richmond
endeavoured
to
console
him
and
was
glad
to
find
him
in
better
spirits
than
he
expected
early
youth
is
seldom
long
dejected
and
misfortunes
at
that
buoyant
season
seem
lighter
than
they
appear
later
on
in
life
the
cause
for
which
he
suffered
moreover
sustained
surrey
and
confident
of
the
fair
geraldine
attachment
he
cared
little
for
the
restraint
imposed
upon
him
on
one
point
he
expressed
some
regret
namely
his
inability
to
prosecute
the
adventure
of
herne
the
hunter
with
the
duke
i
grieve
that
i
can
not
accompany
you
richmond
he
said
but
since
that
is
impossible
let
me
recommend
you
to
take
the
stout
archer
who
goes
by
the
name
of
the
duke
of
shoreditch
with
you
he
is
the
very
man
you
after
some
consideration
the
duke
assented
and
promising
to
return
on
the
following
day
and
report
what
had
occurred
he
took
his
leave
and
went
in
search
of
the
archer
in
question
finding
he
had
taken
up
his
quarters
at
the
garter
he
sent
for
him
and
proposed
the
matter
shoreditch
heard
the
duke
relation
with
astonishment
but
expressed
the
greatest
willingness
to
accompany
him
pledging
himself
as
richmond
demanded
to
profound
secrecy
on
the
subject
at
the
appointed
hour
namely
midnight
the
duke
quitted
the
castle
and
found
shoreditch
waiting
for
him
near
the
upper
gate
the
latter
was
armed
with
a
stout
staff
and
a
bow
and
arrows
if
we
gain
sight
of
the
mysterious
horseman
he
said
a
shaft
shall
try
whether
he
is
of
mortal
mould
or
not
if
he
be
not
a
demon
i
will
warrant
he
rides
no
quitting
the
home
park
they
shaped
their
course
at
once
towards
the
forest
it
was
a
stormy
night
and
the
moon
was
obscured
by
thick
clouds
before
they
reached
the
hill
at
the
end
of
the
long
avenue
a
heavy
thunderstorm
came
on
and
the
lightning
playing
among
the
trees
seemed
to
reveal
a
thousand
fantastic
forms
to
their
gaze
presently
the
rain
began
to
descend
in
torrents
and
compelled
them
to
take
refuge
beneath
a
large
it
was
evident
notwithstanding
his
boasting
that
the
courage
of
shoreditch
was
waning
fast
and
he
at
last
proposed
to
his
leader
that
they
should
return
as
soon
as
the
rain
abated
but
the
duke
indignantly
rejected
the
proposal
while
they
were
thus
sheltering
themselves
the
low
winding
of
a
horn
was
heard
the
sound
was
succeeded
by
the
trampling
of
horses
hoofs
and
the
next
moment
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
showed
a
hart
darting
past
followed
by
a
troop
of
some
twenty
ghostly
horsemen
headed
by
the
demon
hunter
the
duke
of
richmond
bade
his
companion
send
a
shaft
after
them
but
the
latter
was
so
overcome
by
terror
that
he
could
scarcely
fix
an
arrow
on
the
string
and
when
he
bent
the
bow
the
shaft
glanced
from
the
branches
of
an
adjoining
tree
the
storm
continued
with
unabated
fury
for
nearly
an
hour
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
it
partially
cleared
off
and
though
it
was
still
profoundly
dark
the
duke
insisted
upon
going
on
so
they
pressed
forward
beneath
the
dripping
trees
and
through
the
wet
grass
ever
and
anon
the
moon
broke
through
the
rifted
clouds
and
shed
a
wild
glimmer
upon
the
scene
as
they
were
tracking
a
glade
on
the
farther
side
of
the
hill
the
spectral
huntsmen
again
swept
past
them
and
so
closely
that
they
could
almost
touch
their
horses
to
the
duke
horror
he
perceived
among
them
the
body
of
the
butcher
mark
fytton
sitting
erect
upon
a
powerful
black
steed
by
this
time
shoreditch
having
somewhat
regained
his
courage
discharged
another
shaft
at
the
troop
the
arrow
struck
the
body
of
the
butcher
and
completely
transfixed
it
but
did
not
check
his
career
while
wild
and
derisive
laughter
broke
from
the
rest
of
the
cavalcade
the
duke
of
richmond
hurried
after
the
band
trying
to
keep
them
in
sight
and
shoreditch
flinging
down
his
bow
which
he
found
useless
and
grasping
his
staff
endeavoured
to
keep
up
with
him
but
though
they
ran
swiftly
down
the
glade
and
tried
to
peer
through
the
darkness
they
could
see
nothing
more
of
the
ghostly
company
after
a
while
they
arrived
at
a
hillside
at
the
foot
of
which
lay
the
lake
whose
darkling
waters
were
just
distinguishable
through
an
opening
in
the
trees
as
the
duke
was
debating
with
himself
whether
to
go
on
or
retrace
his
course
the
trampling
of
a
horse
was
heard
behind
them
and
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
they
beheld
herne
the
hunter
mounted
on
his
swarthy
steed
and
accompanied
only
by
his
two
black
hounds
galloping
furiously
down
the
declivity
before
him
flew
the
owl
whooping
as
it
sailed
along
the
air
the
demon
hunter
was
so
close
to
them
that
they
could
perfectly
discern
his
horrible
lineaments
the
chain
depending
from
his
neck
and
his
antlered
helm
richmond
shouted
to
him
but
the
rider
continued
his
headlong
course
towards
the
lake
heedless
of
the
call
the
two
beholders
rushed
forward
but
by
this
time
the
huntsman
had
gained
the
edge
of
the
lake
one
of
his
sable
hounds
plunged
into
it
and
the
owl
skimmed
over
its
surface
even
in
the
hasty
view
which
the
duke
caught
of
the
flying
figure
he
fancied
he
perceived
that
it
was
attended
by
a
fantastic
shadow
whether
cast
by
itself
or
arising
from
some
supernatural
cause
he
could
not
determine
but
what
followed
was
equally
marvellous
and
incomprehensible
as
the
wild
huntsman
reached
the
brink
of
the
lake
he
placed
a
horn
to
his
mouth
and
blew
from
it
a
bright
blue
flame
which
illumined
his
own
dusky
and
hideous
features
and
shed
a
wild
and
unearthly
glimmer
over
the
surrounding
objects
while
enveloped
in
this
flame
the
demon
plunged
into
the
lake
and
apparently
descended
to
its
abysses
for
as
soon
as
the
duke
could
muster
courage
to
approach
its
brink
nothing
could
be
seen
of
him
his
steed
or
his
hounds
thus
ends
the
first
book
of
the
chronicle
of
windsor
castle
book
ii
herne
the
hunter
i
of
the
compact
between
sir
thomas
wyat
and
herne
the
hunter
on
the
day
after
his
secret
interview
with
anne
boleyn
sir
thomas
wyat
received
despatches
from
the
king
for
the
court
of
france
his
majesty
bade
me
tell
you
to
make
your
preparations
quickly
sir
thomas
said
the
messenger
who
delivered
the
despatches
he
cares
not
how
soon
you
set
the
king
pleasure
shall
be
obeyed
rejoined
wyat
and
the
messenger
retired
left
alone
wyat
remained
for
some
time
in
profound
and
melancholy
thought
heaving
a
deep
sigh
he
then
arose
and
paced
the
chamber
with
rapid
strides
yes
it
is
better
thus
he
ejaculated
if
i
remain
near
her
i
shall
do
some
desperate
deed
better
far
better
i
should
go
and
yet
to
leave
her
with
henry
to
know
that
he
is
ever
near
her
that
he
drinks
in
the
music
of
her
voice
and
basks
in
the
sunshine
of
her
smile
while
i
am
driven
forth
to
darkness
and
despair
the
thought
is
madness
i
will
not
obey
the
hateful
mandate
i
will
stay
and
defy
him
as
he
uttered
aloud
this
wild
and
unguarded
speech
the
arras
screening
the
door
was
drawn
aside
and
gave
admittance
to
wolsey
wyat
gaze
sunk
before
the
penetrating
glance
fixed
upon
him
by
the
cardinal
i
did
not
come
to
play
the
eavesdropper
sir
thomas
said
wolsey
but
i
have
heard
enough
to
place
your
life
in
my
power
so
you
refuse
to
obey
the
king
injunctions
you
refuse
to
proceed
to
paris
you
refuse
to
assist
in
bringing
about
the
divorce
and
prefer
remaining
here
to
brave
your
sovereign
and
avenge
yourself
upon
a
fickle
mistress
ha
wyat
returned
no
answer
if
such
be
your
purpose
pursued
wolsey
after
a
pause
during
which
he
intently
scrutinised
the
knight
countenance
i
will
assist
you
in
it
be
ruled
by
me
and
you
shall
have
a
deep
and
full
say
on
rejoined
wyat
his
eyes
blazing
with
infernal
fire
and
his
hand
involuntarily
clutching
the
handle
of
his
dagger
if
i
read
you
aright
continued
the
cardinal
you
are
arrived
at
that
pitch
of
desperation
when
life
itself
becomes
indifferent
and
when
but
one
object
remains
to
be
gained
and
that
is
vengeance
interrupted
wyat
fiercely
right
cardinal
right
i
will
have
vengeance
terrible
vengeance
you
shall
but
i
will
not
deceive
you
you
will
purchase
what
you
seek
at
the
price
of
your
own
i
care
not
replied
wyat
all
sentiments
of
love
and
loyalty
are
swallowed
up
by
jealousy
and
burning
hate
nothing
but
blood
can
allay
the
fever
that
consumes
me
show
me
how
to
slay
him
him
echoed
the
cardinal
in
alarm
and
horror
wretch
would
you
kill
your
king
god
forbid
that
i
should
counsel
the
injury
of
a
hair
of
his
head
i
do
not
want
you
to
play
the
assassin
wyat
he
added
more
calmly
but
the
just
avenger
liberate
the
king
from
the
thraldom
of
the
capricious
siren
who
enslaves
him
and
you
will
do
a
service
to
the
whole
country
a
word
from
you
a
letter
a
token
will
cast
her
from
the
king
and
place
her
on
the
block
and
what
matter
the
gory
scaffold
were
better
than
henry
i
can
not
harm
her
cried
wyat
distractedly
i
love
her
still
devotedly
as
ever
she
was
in
my
power
yesterday
and
without
your
aid
cardinal
i
could
have
wreaked
my
vengeance
upon
her
if
i
had
been
so
you
were
then
in
her
chamber
as
the
king
suspected
cried
wolsey
with
a
look
of
exultation
trouble
yourself
no
more
sir
thomas
i
will
take
the
part
of
vengeance
off
your
my
indiscretion
will
avail
you
little
cardinal
replied
wyat
sternly
a
hasty
word
proves
nothing
i
will
perish
on
the
rack
sooner
than
accuse
anne
boleyn
i
am
a
desperate
man
but
not
so
desperate
as
you
suppose
me
a
moment
ago
i
might
have
been
led
on
by
the
murderous
and
traitorous
impulse
that
prompted
me
to
lift
my
hand
against
the
king
but
i
never
could
have
injured
you
are
a
madman
cried
wolsey
impatiently
and
it
is
a
waste
of
time
to
argue
with
you
i
wish
you
good
speed
on
your
journey
on
your
return
you
will
find
anne
boleyn
queen
of
and
you
disgraced
rejoined
wyat
as
with
a
malignant
and
vindictive
look
the
cardinal
quitted
the
chamber
again
left
alone
wyat
fell
into
another
fit
of
despondency
from
which
he
roused
himself
with
difficulty
and
went
forth
to
visit
the
earl
of
surrey
in
the
round
tower
some
delay
occurred
before
he
could
obtain
access
to
the
earl
the
halberdier
stationed
at
the
entrance
to
the
keep
near
the
norman
tower
refused
to
admit
him
without
the
order
of
the
officer
in
command
of
the
tower
and
as
the
latter
was
not
in
the
way
at
the
moment
wyat
had
to
remain
without
till
he
made
his
appearance
while
thus
detained
he
beheld
anne
boleyn
and
her
royal
lover
mount
their
steeds
in
the
upper
ward
and
ride
forth
with
their
attendants
on
a
hawking
expedition
anne
boleyn
bore
a
beautiful
falcon
on
her
wrist
wyat
own
gift
to
her
in
happier
days
and
looked
full
of
coquetry
animation
and
delight
without
the
vestige
of
a
cloud
upon
her
brow
or
a
care
on
her
countenance
with
increased
bitterness
of
heart
he
turned
from
the
sight
and
shrouded
himself
beneath
the
gateway
of
the
norman
tower
soon
after
this
the
officer
appeared
and
at
once
according
wyat
permission
to
see
the
earl
preceded
him
up
the
long
flight
of
stone
steps
communicating
with
the
upper
part
of
the
keep
and
screened
by
an
embattled
and
turreted
structure
constituting
a
covered
way
to
the
round
tower
arrived
at
the
landing
the
officer
unlocked
a
door
on
the
left
and
ushered
his
companion
into
the
prisoner
chamber
influenced
by
the
circular
shape
of
the
structure
in
which
it
was
situated
and
of
which
it
formed
a
segment
the
farther
part
of
this
chamber
was
almost
lost
to
view
and
a
number
of
and
wooden
pillars
added
to
its
sombre
and
mysterious
appearance
the
walls
were
of
enormous
thickness
and
a
narrow
loophole
terminating
a
deep
embrasure
afforded
but
scanty
light
opposite
the
embrasure
sat
surrey
at
a
small
table
covered
with
books
and
writing
materials
a
lute
lay
beside
him
on
the
floor
and
there
were
several
astrological
and
alchemical
implements
within
reach
so
immersed
was
the
youthful
prisoner
in
study
that
he
was
not
aware
until
a
slight
exclamation
was
uttered
by
wyat
of
the
entrance
of
the
latter
he
then
arose
and
gave
him
welcome
nothing
material
passed
between
them
as
long
as
the
officer
remained
in
the
chamber
but
on
his
departure
surrey
observed
laughingly
to
his
friend
and
how
doth
my
fair
cousin
the
lady
anne
boleyn
she
has
just
ridden
forth
with
the
king
to
hawk
in
the
park
replied
wyat
moodily
for
myself
l
am
ordered
on
a
mission
to
france
but
i
could
not
depart
without
entreating
your
forgiveness
for
the
jeopardy
in
which
i
have
placed
you
would
i
could
take
your
do
not
heed
me
replied
surrey
i
am
well
content
with
what
has
happened
virgil
and
homer
dante
and
petrarch
are
the
companions
of
my
confinement
and
in
good
sooth
i
am
glad
to
be
alone
amid
the
distractions
of
the
court
i
could
find
little
leisure
for
the
your
situation
is
in
many
respects
enviable
surrey
replied
wyat
disturbed
by
no
jealous
doubts
and
fears
you
can
beguile
the
tedious
hours
in
the
cultivation
of
your
poetical
tastes
or
in
study
still
i
must
needs
reproach
myself
with
being
the
cause
of
your
i
repeat
you
have
done
me
a
service
rejoined
the
earl
i
would
lay
down
my
life
for
my
fair
cousin
anne
boleyn
and
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
prove
the
sincerity
of
my
regard
for
you
wyat
i
applaud
the
judgment
in
sending
you
to
france
and
if
you
will
be
counselled
by
me
you
will
stay
there
long
enough
to
forget
her
who
now
occasions
you
so
much
will
the
fair
geraldine
be
forgotten
when
the
term
of
your
imprisonment
shall
expire
my
lord
asked
wyat
of
a
surety
not
replied
the
earl
and
yet
in
less
than
two
months
i
shall
return
from
france
rejoined
wyat
our
cases
are
not
alike
said
surrey
the
lady
elizabeth
fitzgerald
has
plighted
her
troth
to
anne
boleyn
vowed
eternal
constancy
to
me
cried
wyat
bitterly
and
you
see
how
she
kept
her
oath
the
absent
are
always
in
danger
and
few
women
are
proof
against
ambition
vanity
vanity
is
the
rock
they
split
upon
may
you
never
experience
from
richmond
the
wrong
i
have
experienced
from
his
i
have
no
fear
replied
surrey
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
slight
noise
in
that
part
of
the
chamber
which
was
buried
in
darkness
have
we
a
listener
here
cried
wyat
grasping
his
sword
not
unless
it
be
a
one
from
the
dungeons
beneath
replied
surrey
but
you
were
speaking
of
richmond
he
visited
me
this
morning
and
came
to
relate
the
particulars
of
a
mysterious
adventure
that
occurred
to
him
last
and
the
earl
proceeded
to
detail
what
had
befallen
the
duke
in
the
forest
a
marvellous
story
truly
said
wyat
pondering
upon
the
relation
i
will
seek
out
the
demon
huntsman
again
a
noise
similar
to
that
heard
a
moment
before
resounded
from
the
lower
part
of
the
room
wyat
immediately
flew
thither
and
drawing
his
sword
searched
about
with
its
point
but
ineffectually
it
could
not
be
fancy
he
said
and
yet
nothing
is
to
be
i
do
not
like
jesting
about
herne
the
hunter
remarked
surrey
after
what
i
myself
have
seen
in
your
present
frame
of
mind
i
advise
you
not
to
hazard
an
interview
with
the
fiend
he
has
power
over
the
wyat
returned
no
answer
he
seemed
lost
in
gloomy
thought
and
soon
afterwards
took
his
leave
on
returning
to
his
lodgings
he
summoned
his
attendants
and
ordered
them
to
proceed
to
kingston
adding
that
he
would
join
them
there
early
the
next
morning
one
of
them
an
old
noticing
the
exceeding
haggardness
of
his
looks
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
go
with
them
but
wyat
with
a
harshness
totally
unlike
his
customary
manner
which
was
gracious
and
kindly
in
the
extreme
peremptorily
refused
you
look
very
ill
sir
thomas
said
the
old
servant
worse
than
i
ever
remember
seeing
you
listen
to
my
counsel
i
beseech
you
plead
ill
health
with
the
king
in
excuse
of
your
mission
to
france
and
retire
for
some
months
to
recruit
your
strength
and
spirits
at
tush
adam
twisden
i
am
well
enough
exclaimed
wyat
impatiently
go
and
prepare
my
my
dear
dear
master
cried
old
adam
bending
the
knee
before
him
and
pressing
his
hand
to
his
lips
something
tells
me
that
if
i
leave
you
now
i
shall
never
see
you
again
there
is
a
paleness
in
your
cheek
and
a
fire
in
your
eye
such
as
i
never
before
observed
in
you
or
in
mortal
man
i
tremble
to
say
it
but
you
look
like
one
possessed
by
the
fiend
forgive
my
boldness
sir
i
speak
from
affection
and
duty
i
was
to
your
father
good
sir
henry
wyat
before
you
and
i
love
you
as
a
son
while
i
honour
you
as
a
master
i
have
heard
that
there
are
evil
beings
in
the
forest
nay
even
within
the
castle
who
lure
men
to
perdition
by
promising
to
accomplish
their
wicked
desires
i
trust
no
such
being
has
crossed
your
make
yourself
easy
good
adam
replied
wyat
no
fiend
has
tempted
swear
it
sir
cried
the
old
man
eagerly
swear
it
by
the
holy
by
the
holy
trinity
i
swear
it
replied
wyat
as
the
words
were
uttered
the
door
behind
the
arras
was
suddenly
shut
with
violence
curses
on
you
villain
you
have
left
the
door
open
cried
wyat
fiercely
our
conversation
has
been
i
will
soon
see
by
whom
cried
adam
springing
to
his
feet
and
rushing
towards
the
door
which
opened
upon
a
long
corridor
well
cried
wyat
as
adam
returned
the
next
moment
with
cheeks
almost
as
white
as
his
own
was
it
the
cardinal
it
was
the
devil
i
believe
replied
the
old
man
i
could
see
no
it
would
not
require
supernatural
power
to
retreat
into
an
adjoining
chamber
replied
wyat
affecting
an
incredulity
he
was
far
from
feeling
your
worship
adjuration
was
strangely
interrupted
cried
the
old
man
crossing
himself
devoutly
saint
dunstan
and
saint
christopher
shield
us
from
evil
spirits
a
truce
to
your
idle
terrors
adam
said
wyat
take
these
packets
he
added
giving
him
henry
despatches
and
guard
them
as
you
would
your
life
i
am
going
on
an
expedition
of
some
peril
and
do
not
choose
to
keep
them
about
me
bid
the
grooms
have
my
steed
in
readiness
an
hour
before
i
hope
your
worship
is
not
about
to
ride
into
the
forest
at
that
hour
said
adam
trembling
i
was
told
by
the
stout
archer
whom
the
king
dubbed
duke
of
shoreditch
that
he
and
the
duke
of
richmond
ventured
thither
last
night
and
that
they
saw
a
legion
of
demons
mounted
on
horses
and
amongst
them
mark
fytton
the
butcher
who
was
hanged
a
few
days
ago
from
the
curfew
tower
by
the
king
order
and
whose
body
so
strangely
disappeared
do
not
go
into
the
forest
dear
sir
thomas
no
more
of
this
cried
wyat
fiercely
do
as
i
bid
you
and
if
i
join
you
not
before
noon
proceed
to
rochester
and
there
await
my
i
never
expect
to
see
you
again
sir
groaned
the
old
man
as
he
took
his
leave
the
anxious
concern
evinced
in
his
behalf
by
his
old
and
trusty
servant
was
not
without
effect
on
sir
thomas
wyat
and
made
him
hesitate
in
his
design
but
another
access
of
jealous
rage
came
on
and
overwhelmed
all
his
better
resolutions
he
remained
within
his
chamber
to
a
late
hour
and
then
issuing
forth
proceeded
to
the
terrace
at
the
north
of
the
castle
where
he
was
challenged
by
a
sentinel
but
was
suffered
to
pass
on
on
giving
the
the
night
was
profoundly
dark
and
the
whole
of
the
glorious
prospect
commanded
by
the
terrace
shrouded
from
view
but
wyat
object
in
coming
thither
was
to
gaze
for
the
last
time
at
that
part
of
the
castle
which
enclosed
anne
boleyn
and
knowing
well
the
situation
of
her
apartments
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
windows
but
although
numerous
lights
streamed
from
the
adjoining
corridor
all
here
was
buried
in
obscurity
suddenly
however
the
chamber
was
illumined
and
he
beheld
henry
and
anne
boleyn
enter
it
preceded
by
a
band
of
attendants
bearing
tapers
it
needed
not
wyat
gaze
to
read
even
at
that
distance
the
king
enamoured
looks
or
anne
boleyn
responsive
glances
he
saw
that
one
of
henry
arms
encircled
her
waist
while
the
other
caressed
her
yielding
hand
they
paused
henry
bent
forward
and
anne
half
averted
her
head
but
not
so
much
so
as
to
prevent
the
king
from
imprinting
a
long
and
fervid
kiss
upon
her
lips
terrible
was
its
effect
upon
wyat
an
adder
bite
would
have
been
less
painful
his
hands
convulsively
clutched
together
his
hair
stood
erect
upon
his
head
a
shiver
ran
through
his
frame
and
he
tottered
back
several
paces
when
he
recovered
henry
had
bidden
to
the
object
of
his
love
and
having
nearly
gained
the
door
turned
and
waved
a
tender
valediction
to
her
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
anne
looked
round
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
pride
and
pleasure
at
her
attendants
but
a
cloud
of
curtains
dropping
over
the
window
shrouded
her
from
the
sight
of
her
wretched
lover
in
a
state
of
agitation
wholly
indescribable
wyat
staggered
towards
the
edge
of
the
terrace
it
might
be
with
the
design
of
flinging
himself
from
it
but
when
within
a
few
yards
of
the
low
parapet
wall
defending
its
precipitous
side
he
perceived
a
tall
dark
figure
standing
directly
in
his
path
and
halted
whether
the
object
he
beheld
was
human
or
not
he
could
not
determine
but
it
seemed
of
more
than
mortal
stature
it
was
wrapped
in
a
long
black
cloak
and
wore
a
high
conical
cap
on
its
head
before
wyat
could
speak
the
figure
addressed
him
you
desire
to
see
herne
the
hunter
said
the
figure
in
a
deep
sepulchral
tone
ride
hence
to
the
haunted
beechtree
near
the
marsh
at
the
farther
side
of
the
forest
and
you
will
find
you
are
herne
i
feel
it
cried
wyat
why
go
into
the
forest
speak
and
he
stepped
forward
with
the
intention
of
grasping
the
figure
but
it
eluded
him
and
with
a
mocking
laugh
melted
into
the
darkness
wyat
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
terrace
and
looked
over
the
parapet
but
he
could
see
nothing
except
the
tops
of
the
tall
trees
springing
from
the
side
of
the
moat
flying
to
the
sentinel
he
inquired
whether
any
one
had
passed
him
but
the
man
returned
an
angry
denial
awestricken
and
agitated
wyat
quitted
the
terrace
and
seeking
his
steed
mounted
him
and
galloped
into
the
forest
if
he
i
have
seen
be
not
indeed
the
fiend
he
will
scarcely
outstrip
me
in
the
race
he
cried
as
his
steed
bore
him
at
a
furious
pace
up
the
long
avenue
the
gloom
was
here
profound
being
increased
by
the
dense
masses
of
foliage
beneath
which
he
was
riding
by
the
time
however
that
he
reached
the
summit
of
snow
hill
the
moon
struggled
through
the
clouds
and
threw
a
wan
glimmer
over
the
leafy
wilderness
around
the
deep
slumber
of
the
woods
was
unbroken
by
any
sound
save
that
of
the
frenzied
rider
bursting
through
them
well
acquainted
with
the
forest
wyat
held
on
a
direct
course
his
brain
was
on
fire
and
the
fury
of
his
career
increased
his
fearful
excitement
heedless
of
all
impediments
he
pressed
forward
now
dashing
beneath
overhanging
boughs
at
the
risk
of
his
neck
now
skirting
the
edge
of
a
glen
where
a
false
step
might
have
proved
fatal
on
on
he
went
his
frenzy
increasing
each
moment
at
length
he
reached
the
woody
height
overlooking
the
marshy
tract
that
formed
the
limit
of
his
ride
once
more
the
moon
had
withdrawn
her
lustre
and
a
huge
indistinct
black
mass
alone
pointed
out
the
position
of
the
haunted
tree
around
it
wheeled
a
large
white
owl
distinguishable
by
its
ghostly
plumage
through
the
gloom
like
a
in
a
storm
and
hooting
bodingly
as
it
winged
its
mystic
flight
no
other
sound
was
heard
nor
living
object
seen
while
gazing
into
the
dreary
expanse
beneath
him
wyat
for
the
first
time
since
starting
experienced
a
sensation
of
doubt
and
dread
and
the
warning
of
his
old
and
faithful
attendant
rushed
upon
his
mind
he
tried
to
recite
a
prayer
but
the
words
died
away
on
his
lips
neither
would
his
fingers
fashion
the
symbol
of
a
cross
but
even
these
admonitions
did
not
restrain
him
springing
from
his
foaming
and
panting
steed
and
taking
the
bridle
in
his
hand
he
descended
the
side
of
the
acclivity
ever
and
anon
a
rustling
among
the
grass
told
him
that
a
snake
with
which
description
of
reptile
the
spot
abounded
was
gliding
away
from
him
his
horse
which
had
hitherto
been
all
fire
and
impetuosity
now
began
to
manifest
symptoms
of
alarm
quivered
in
every
limb
snorted
and
required
to
be
dragged
along
forcibly
when
within
a
few
paces
of
the
tree
its
enormous
rifted
trunk
became
fully
revealed
to
him
but
no
one
was
beside
it
wyat
then
stood
still
and
cried
in
a
loud
commanding
tone
spirit
i
summon
thee
appear
at
these
words
a
sound
like
a
peal
of
thunder
rolled
over
head
accompanied
by
screeches
of
discordant
laughter
other
strange
and
unearthly
noises
were
heard
and
amidst
the
din
a
blue
phosphoric
light
issued
from
the
yawning
crevice
in
the
tree
while
a
tall
gaunt
figure
crested
with
an
antlered
helm
sprang
from
it
at
the
same
moment
a
swarm
of
horribly
grotesque
swart
objects
looking
like
imps
appeared
amid
the
branches
of
the
tree
and
grinned
and
gesticulated
at
wyat
whose
courage
remained
unshaken
during
the
fearful
ordeal
not
so
his
steed
after
rearing
and
plunging
violently
the
affrighted
animal
broke
its
hold
and
darted
off
into
the
swamp
where
it
floundered
and
was
lost
you
have
called
me
sir
thomas
wyat
said
the
demon
in
a
sepulchral
tone
i
am
here
what
would
you
my
name
being
known
to
you
spirit
of
darkness
my
errand
should
be
also
replied
wyat
boldly
your
errand
is
known
to
me
replied
the
demon
you
have
lost
a
mistress
and
would
regain
her
i
would
give
my
soul
to
win
her
back
from
my
kingly
rival
cried
wyat
i
accept
your
offer
rejoined
the
spirit
anne
boleyn
shall
be
yours
your
hand
upon
the
wyat
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
grasped
that
of
the
demon
his
fingers
were
compressed
as
if
by
a
vice
and
he
felt
himself
dragged
towards
the
tree
while
a
stifling
and
sulphurous
vapour
rose
around
him
a
black
veil
fell
over
his
head
and
was
rapidly
twined
around
his
brow
in
thick
folds
amid
yells
of
fiendish
laughter
he
was
then
lifted
from
the
ground
thrust
into
the
hollow
of
the
tree
and
thence
as
it
seemed
to
him
conveyed
into
a
deep
subterranean
cave
ii
in
what
manner
wolsey
put
his
scheme
into
operation
foiled
in
his
scheme
of
making
wyat
the
instrument
of
anne
overthrow
wolsey
determined
to
put
into
immediate
operation
the
plan
he
had
conceived
of
bringing
forward
a
rival
to
her
with
the
king
if
a
choice
had
been
allowed
him
he
would
have
selected
some
dame
for
the
purpose
but
as
this
was
out
of
the
question
and
as
indeed
henry
had
of
late
proved
insensible
to
the
attractions
of
all
the
beauties
that
crowded
his
court
except
anne
boleyn
he
trusted
to
the
forester
fair
granddaughter
to
accomplish
his
object
the
source
whence
he
had
received
intelligence
of
the
king
admiration
of
mabel
lyndwood
was
his
jester
patch
a
shrewd
varlet
who
under
the
mask
of
folly
picked
up
many
an
important
secret
for
his
master
and
was
proportionately
rewarded
before
executing
the
scheme
it
was
necessary
to
ascertain
whether
the
damsel
beauty
was
as
extraordinary
as
it
had
been
represented
and
with
this
view
wolsey
mounted
his
mule
one
morning
and
accompanied
by
patch
and
another
attendant
rode
towards
the
forest
it
was
a
bright
and
beautiful
morning
and
preoccupied
as
he
was
the
plotting
cardinal
could
not
be
wholly
insensible
to
the
loveliness
of
the
scene
around
him
crossing
spring
hill
he
paused
at
the
head
of
a
long
glade
skirted
on
the
right
by
noble
whose
silver
stems
sparkled
in
the
sun
shine
and
extending
down
to
the
thicket
now
called
cooke
hill
wood
from
this
point
as
from
every
other
eminence
on
the
northern
side
of
the
forest
a
magnificent
view
of
the
castle
was
obtained
the
sight
of
the
kingly
pile
towering
above
its
vassal
woods
kindled
high
and
ambitious
thoughts
in
his
breast
the
lord
of
that
proud
structure
has
been
for
years
swayed
by
me
he
mused
and
shall
the
royal
puppet
be
at
last
wrested
from
me
by
a
woman
hand
not
if
i
can
hold
my
roused
by
the
reflection
he
quickened
his
pace
and
shaping
his
course
towards
black
nest
reached
in
a
short
time
the
borders
of
a
wide
swamp
lying
between
the
great
lake
and
another
pool
of
water
of
less
extent
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
this
wild
and
dreary
marsh
the
haunt
of
the
bittern
and
the
plover
contrasted
forcibly
and
disagreeably
with
the
rich
sylvan
district
he
had
just
quitted
i
should
not
like
to
cross
this
swamp
at
night
he
observed
to
patch
who
rode
close
behind
him
nor
i
your
grace
replied
the
buffoon
we
might
chance
to
be
led
by

such
treacherous

not

rejoined
wolsey
mankind
are
often
lured
by
delusive
gleams
of
glory
and
power
into
quagmires
deep
and
pitfalls
holy
virgin
what
have
we
here
the
exclamation
was
occasioned
by
a
figure
that
suddenly
emerged
from
the
ground
at
a
little
distance
on
the
right
wolsey
mule
swerved
so
much
as
almost
to
endanger
his
seat
and
he
called
out
in
a
loud
angry
tone
to
the
author
of
the
annoyance
who
are
you
knave
and
what
do
you
here
i
am
a
keeper
of
the
forest
a
please
your
grace
replied
the
other
doffing
his
cap
and
disclosing
harsh
features
which
by
no
means
recommended
him
to
the
cardinal
and
am
named
morgan
fenwolf
i
was
crouching
among
the
reeds
to
get
a
shot
at
a
fat
buck
when
your
approach
called
me
to
my
by
jude
this
is
the
very
fellow
your
grace
who
shot
the
the
other
day
cried
patch
and
so
preserved
the
lady
anne
boleyn
rejoined
the
cardinal
art
sure
of
it
knave
as
sure
as
your
grace
is
of
canonisation
replied
patch
that
shot
should
have
brought
you
a
rich
reward
friend
either
from
the
highness
or
the
lady
anne
remarked
wolsey
to
the
keeper
it
has
brought
me
nothing
rejoined
fenwolf
sullenly
hum
exclaimed
the
cardinal
give
the
fellow
a
piece
of
gold
methinks
i
should
have
better
earned
your
grace
bounty
if
i
had
let
the
hart
work
his
will
said
fenwolf
reluctantly
receiving
the
coin
how
fellow
cried
the
cardinal
knitting
his
brows
nay
i
mean
no
offence
replied
fenwolf
but
the
rumour
goes
that
your
grace
and
the
lady
anne
are
not
well
affected
towards
each
the
rumour
is
false
rejoined
the
cardinal
and
you
can
now
contradict
it
on
your
own
experience
harkee
sirrah
where
lies
tristram
lyndwood
hut
fenwolf
looked
somewhat
surprised
and
confused
by
the
question
it
lies
on
the
other
side
of
yonder
rising
ground
about
half
a
mile
hence
he
said
but
if
your
grace
is
seeking
old
tristram
you
will
not
find
him
i
parted
with
him
ago
on
hawk
hill
and
he
was
then
on
his
way
to
the
at
bray
if
i
see
his
granddaughter
mabel
it
will
suffice
rejoined
the
cardinal
i
am
told
she
is
a
comely
damsel
is
it
so
i
am
but
an
indifferent
judge
of
beauty
replied
fenwolf
moodily
lead
my
mule
across
this
swamp
thou
senseless
loon
said
the
cardinal
and
i
will
give
thee
my
with
a
very
ill
grace
fenwolf
complied
and
conducted
wolsey
to
the
farther
side
of
the
marsh
if
your
grace
pursues
the
path
over
the
hill
he
said
and
then
strikes
into
the
first
opening
on
the
right
it
will
bring
you
to
the
place
you
and
without
waiting
for
the
promised
blessing
he
disappeared
among
the
trees
on
reaching
the
top
of
the
hill
wolsey
descried
the
hut
through
an
opening
in
the
trees
at
a
few
hundred
yards
distance
it
was
pleasantly
situated
on
the
brink
of
the
lake
at
the
point
where
its
width
was
greatest
and
where
it
was
fed
by
a
brook
that
flowed
into
it
from
a
large
pool
of
water
near
sunninghill
from
the
high
ground
where
wolsey
now
stood
the
view
of
the
lake
was
beautiful
for
nearly
a
mile
its
shining
expanse
was
seen
stretching
out
between
banks
of
varied
form
sometimes
embayed
sometimes
running
out
into
little
headlands
but
everywhere
clothed
with
timber
almost
to
the
water
edge
wild
fowl
skimmed
over
its
glassy
surface
or
dipped
in
search
of
its
finny
prey
and
here
and
there
a
heron
might
be
detected
standing
in
some
shallow
nook
and
feasting
on
the
smaller
fry
a
flight
of
cawing
rooks
were
settling
upon
the
tall
trees
on
the
right
bank
and
the
voices
of
the
thrush
the
blackbird
and
other
feathered
songsters
burst
in
redundant
melody
from
the
nearer
groves
a
verdant
path
partly
beneath
the
trees
and
partly
on
the
side
of
the
lake
led
wolsey
to
the
forester
hut
constructed
of
wood
and
clay
with
a
thatched
roof
green
with
moss
and
half
overgrown
with
ivy
the
little
building
was
in
admirable
keeping
with
the
surrounding
scenery
opposite
the
door
and
opening
upon
the
lake
stood
a
little
boathouse
and
beside
it
a
few
wooden
steps
defended
by
a
handrail
ran
into
the
water
a
few
yards
beyond
the
boathouse
the
brook
before
mentioned
emptied
its
waters
into
the
lake
gazing
with
much
internal
satisfaction
at
the
hut
wolsey
bade
patch
dismount
and
ascertain
whether
mabel
was
within
the
buffoon
obeyed
tried
the
door
and
finding
it
fastened
knocked
but
to
no
purpose
after
a
pause
of
a
few
minutes
the
cardinal
was
turning
away
in
extreme
disappointment
when
a
small
skiff
rowed
by
a
female
hand
shot
round
an
angle
of
the
lake
and
swiftly
approached
them
a
glance
from
patch
would
have
told
wolsey
had
he
required
any
such
information
that
this
was
the
forester
granddaughter
her
beauty
quite
ravished
him
and
drew
from
him
an
exclamation
of
wonder
and
delight
features
regular
exquisitely
moulded
and
of
a
joyous
expression
a
skin
dyed
like
a
peach
by
the
sun
but
so
as
to
improve
rather
than
impair
its
hue
eyes
bright
laughing
and
blue
as
a
summer
sky
ripe
ruddy
lips
and
pearly
teeth
and
hair
of
a
light
and
glossy
brown
constituted
the
sum
of
her
attractions
her
figure
was
charmingly
displayed
by
the
graceful
exercise
on
which
she
was
engaged
and
her
small
hands
seemingly
scarcely
able
to
grasp
an
oar
impelled
the
skiff
forwards
with
marvellous
velocity
and
apparently
without
much
exertion
on
her
part
unabashed
by
the
presence
of
the
strangers
though
wolsey
attire
could
leave
her
in
no
doubt
as
to
his
high
ecclesiastical
dignity
she
sprang
ashore
at
the
and
fastened
her
bark
to
the
side
of
the
boathouse
you
are
mabel
lyndwood
i
presume
fair
maiden
inquired
the
cardinal
in
his
blandest
tones
such
is
my
name
your
grace
she
replied
for
your
garb
tells
me
i
am
addressing
cardinal
the
cardinal
graciously
inclined
his
head
chancing
to
ride
in
this
part
of
the
forest
he
said
and
having
heard
of
your
beauty
i
came
to
see
whether
the
reality
equalled
the
description
and
i
find
it
far
transcends
mabel
blushed
deeply
and
cast
down
her
eyes
would
that
henry
could
see
her
now
thought
the
cardinal
anne
boleyn
reign
were
nigh
at
an
how
long
have
you
dwelt
in
this
cottage
fair
maid
he
added
aloud
my
grandsire
tristram
lyndwood
has
lived
here
fifty
years
and
more
replied
mabel
but
i
have
only
been
its
inmate
within
these
few
weeks
before
that
time
i
lived
at
chertsey
under
the
care
of
one
of
the
lay
sisters
of
the
monastery
there
sister
and
your
parents
where
are
they
asked
the
cardinal
curiously
alas
your
grace
i
have
none
replied
mabel
with
a
sigh
tristram
lyndwood
is
my
only
living
relative
he
used
to
come
over
once
a
month
to
see
me
at
chertsey
and
latterly
finding
his
dwelling
lonely
for
he
lost
the
old
dame
who
tended
it
for
him
he
brought
me
to
dwell
with
him
sister
anastasia
was
loth
to
part
with
me
and
i
was
grieved
to
leave
her
but
i
could
not
refuse
my
of
a
surety
not
replied
the
cardinal
musingly
and
gazing
hard
at
her
and
you
know
nothing
of
your
parents
little
beyond
this
replied
mabel
my
father
was
a
keeper
of
the
forest
and
being
unhappily
gored
by
a
stag
perished
of
the
wound
for
a
hurt
from
a
hart
horn
as
your
grace
knows
is
certain
death
and
my
mother
pined
after
him
and
speedily
followed
him
to
the
grave
i
was
then
placed
by
my
grandsire
with
sister
anastasia
as
i
have
just
related
and
this
is
all
my
a
simple
yet
a
curious
one
said
wolsey
still
musing
you
are
the
fairest
maid
of
low
degree
i
ever
beheld
you
saw
the
king
at
the
chase
the
other
day
mabel
truly
did
i
your
grace
she
replied
her
eyes
brightening
and
her
colour
rising
and
a
right
noble
king
he
and
as
gentle
and
winning
as
he
is
goodly
to
look
upon
said
wolsey
smiling
report
says
otherwise
rejoined
mabel
report
speaks
falsely
cried
wolsey
i
know
him
well
and
he
is
what
i
describe
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
replied
mabel
and
i
must
own
i
formed
the
same
opinion
myself
for
the
smile
he
threw
upon
me
was
one
of
the
sweetest
and
kindliest
i
ever
since
you
confess
so
much
fair
maiden
rejoined
wolsey
i
will
be
equally
frank
and
tell
you
it
was
from
the
king
own
lips
i
heard
of
your
your
grace
she
exclaimed
well
well
said
wolsey
smiling
if
the
king
is
bewitched
i
can
not
marvel
at
it
and
now
good
day
fair
maiden
you
will
hear
more
of
your
grace
will
not
refuse
me
your
blessing
said
mabel
assuredly
not
my
child
replied
wolsey
stretching
his
hands
over
her
all
good
angels
and
saints
bless
you
and
hold
you
in
their
keeping
mark
my
words
a
great
destiny
awaits
you
but
in
all
changes
rest
assured
you
will
find
a
friend
in
cardinal
your
grace
overwhelms
me
with
kindness
cried
mabel
nor
can
i
conceive
how
i
have
found
an
interest
in
your
eyes
unless
sister
anastasia
or
father
anslem
of
chertsey
abbey
may
have
mentioned
me
to
you
have
found
a
more
potent
advocate
with
me
than
either
sister
anastasia
or
father
anselm
replied
wolsey
and
now
and
turning
the
head
of
his
mule
he
rode
slowly
away
on
the
same
day
there
was
a
great
banquet
in
the
castle
and
as
usual
wolsey
took
his
station
on
the
right
of
the
sovereign
while
the
papal
legate
occupied
a
place
on
the
left
watching
a
favourable
opportunity
wolsey
observed
to
henry
that
he
had
been
riding
that
morning
in
the
forest
and
had
seen
the
loveliest
damsel
that
eyes
ever
fell
upon
ah
by
our
lady
and
who
may
she
be
asked
the
king
curiously
she
can
boast
little
in
regard
to
birth
being
grandchild
to
an
old
forester
replied
wolsey
but
your
majesty
saw
her
at
the
hunting
party
the
other
ah
now
i
bethink
me
of
her
said
henry
a
comely
damsel
in
good
i
know
not
where
her
match
is
to
be
found
cried
the
cardinal
would
your
majesty
had
seen
her
skim
over
the
lake
in
a
fairy
boat
managed
by
herself
as
i
beheld
her
this
morning
you
would
have
taken
her
for
a
except
that
no
was
half
so
you
speak
in
raptures
cardinal
cried
henry
i
must
see
this
damsel
again
where
does
she
dwell
i
have
heard
but
it
has
slipped
my
in
a
hut
near
the
great
lake
replied
wolsey
there
is
some
mystery
attached
to
her
birth
which
i
have
not
yet
leave
me
to
unriddle
it
replied
the
king
laughingly
and
he
turned
to
talk
on
other
subjects
to
campeggio
but
wolsey
felt
satisfied
that
the
device
was
successful
nor
was
he
mistaken
as
henry
retired
from
the
banquet
he
motioned
the
duke
of
suffolk
towards
him
and
said
in
an
undertone
i
shall
go
forth
at
dusk
even
in
disguise
and
shall
require
your
on
a
love
affair
asked
the
duke
in
the
same
tone
perchance
replied
henry
but
i
will
explain
myself
more
fully
this
muttered
colloquy
was
overheard
by
patch
and
faithfully
reported
by
him
to
the
cardinal
iii
of
the
visit
of
the
two
guildford
merchants
to
the
forester
hut
tristam
lyndwood
did
not
return
home
till
late
in
the
evening
and
when
informed
of
the
cardinal
visit
he
shook
his
head
gravely
i
am
sorry
we
went
to
the
hunting
party
he
observed
valentine
hagthorne
said
mischief
would
come
of
it
and
i
wish
i
had
attended
to
his
i
see
no
mischief
in
the
matter
grandsire
cried
mabel
on
the
contrary
i
think
i
have
met
with
excellent
fortune
the
good
cardinal
promises
me
a
high
destiny
and
says
the
king
himself
noticed
would
his
regards
had
fallen
anywhere
than
on
you
rejoined
tristram
but
i
warrant
me
you
told
the
cardinal
your
history
all
you
know
of
it
at
i
did
so
she
replied
nor
did
i
know
i
was
doing
any
answer
no
such
inquiries
in
future
said
tristram
angrily
but
grandfather
i
could
not
refuse
to
answer
the
cardinal
she
replied
in
a
deprecating
voice
no
more
excuses
but
attend
to
my
injunctions
said
tristram
have
you
seen
morgan
fenwolf
no
and
i
care
not
if
i
never
see
him
again
she
replied
pettishly
you
dislike
him
strangely
mab
rejoined
her
grandfather
he
is
the
best
keeper
in
the
forest
and
makes
no
secret
of
his
love
for
the
very
reason
why
i
dislike
him
she
returned
by
the
same
rule
if
what
the
cardinal
stated
be
true
though
trust
me
he
was
but
jesting
you
ought
to
dislike
the
king
but
get
my
supper
i
have
need
of
it
for
i
have
fasted
mabel
hastened
to
obey
and
set
a
mess
of
hot
pottage
and
other
viands
before
him
little
more
conversation
passed
between
them
for
the
old
man
was
weary
and
sought
his
couch
early
that
night
mabel
did
nothing
but
dream
of
the
king
of
stately
chambers
rich
apparel
and
countless
attendants
she
awoke
and
finding
herself
in
a
lowly
cottage
and
without
a
single
attendant
was
like
other
dreamers
of
imaginary
splendour
greatly
discontented
the
next
morning
her
grandsire
went
again
to
bray
wood
and
she
was
left
to
muse
upon
the
event
of
the
previous
day
while
busied
about
some
trifling
occupation
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
morgan
fenwolf
entered
the
cottage
he
was
followed
by
a
tall
man
with
a
countenance
of
extreme
paleness
but
a
noble
and
commanding
figure
there
was
something
so
striking
in
the
appearance
of
the
latter
person
that
it
riveted
the
attention
of
mabel
but
no
corresponding
effect
was
produced
on
the
stranger
for
he
scarcely
bestowed
a
look
upon
her
morgan
fenwolf
hastily
asked
whether
her
grandsire
was
at
home
or
near
at
hand
and
being
answered
in
the
negative
appeared
much
disappointed
he
then
said
that
he
must
borrow
the
skiff
for
a
short
while
as
he
wished
to
visit
some
nets
on
the
lake
mabel
readily
assented
and
the
stranger
quitted
the
house
while
fenwolf
lingered
to
offer
some
attention
to
mabel
which
was
so
ill
received
that
he
was
fain
to
hurry
forth
to
the
boathouse
where
he
embarked
with
his
companion
as
soon
as
the
plash
of
oars
announced
their
departure
mabel
went
forth
to
watch
them
the
stranger
who
was
seated
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
for
the
first
time
fixed
his
large
melancholy
eyes
full
upon
her
and
did
not
withdraw
his
gaze
till
an
angle
of
the
lake
hid
him
from
view
marvelling
who
he
could
be
and
reproaching
herself
for
not
questioning
fenwolf
on
the
subject
mabel
resolved
to
repair
the
error
when
the
skiff
was
brought
back
but
the
opportunity
did
not
speedily
occur
hours
flew
by
the
shades
of
evening
drew
on
but
neither
fenwolf
nor
the
stranger
returned
soon
after
dusk
her
grandfather
came
home
he
did
not
express
the
least
astonishment
at
fenwolf
prolonged
absence
but
said
that
he
was
sure
to
be
back
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
the
skiff
was
not
wanted
he
will
bring
us
a
fine
jack
or
a
carp
for
dinner
warrant
me
he
said
if
he
had
returned
in
time
we
might
have
had
fish
for
supper
no
matter
i
must
make
shift
with
the
mutton
pie
and
a
rasher
of
bacon
morgan
did
not
mention
the
name
of
his
companion
you
say
he
did
not
replied
mabel
but
i
hope
he
will
bring
him
with
him
he
is
the
goodliest
gentleman
i
ever
what
a
goodlier
gentleman
than
the
king
cried
tristram
nay
they
should
not
be
compared
replied
mabel
the
one
is
stout
and
burly
the
other
slight
and
pale
but
handsome
withal
very
well
i
daresay
i
shall
see
him
anon
said
tristram
and
now
for
supper
for
i
am
as
as
a
wolf
and
so
is
old
hubert
he
added
glancing
affectionately
at
the
hound
by
which
he
was
attended
mabel
placed
the
better
part
of
a
huge
pie
before
him
which
the
old
forester
attacked
with
great
zeal
he
then
fell
to
work
upon
some
slices
of
bacon
toasted
over
the
embers
by
his
granddaughter
and
having
washed
them
down
with
a
jug
of
mead
declared
he
had
supped
famously
while
taking
care
of
himself
he
did
not
forget
his
hound
from
time
to
time
he
threw
him
morsels
of
the
pie
and
when
he
had
done
he
gave
him
a
large
platterful
of
bones
old
hubert
has
served
me
faithfully
nigh
twenty
years
he
said
patting
the
hound
shaggy
neck
and
must
not
be
throwing
a
log
of
wood
on
the
fire
he
drew
his
chair
into
the
and
disposed
himself
to
slumber
meanwhile
mabel
busied
herself
about
her
household
concern
and
was
singing
a
lulling
melody
to
her
grandfather
in
a
voice
of
exquisite
sweetness
when
a
loud
tap
was
heard
at
the
door
tristram
roused
himself
from
his
doze
and
old
hubert
growled
menacingly
quiet
hubert
quiet
cried
tristram
it
can
not
be
morgan
fenwolf
he
added
he
would
never
knock
thus
come
in
friend
whoever
thou
at
this
invitation
two
persons
darkened
the
doorway
the
foremost
was
a
man
of
bulky
frame
and
burly
demeanour
he
was
attired
in
a
buff
jerkin
over
which
he
wore
a
loose
great
surcoat
had
a
flat
velvet
cap
on
his
head
and
carried
a
stout
staff
in
his
hand
his
face
was
broad
and
handsome
though
his
features
could
scarcely
be
discerned
in
the
doubtful
light
to
which
they
were
submitted
a
beard
clothed
his
chin
his
companion
who
appeared
a
trifle
the
taller
of
the
two
and
equally
robust
was
wrapped
in
a
cloak
of
dark
green
camlet
give
you
good
friend
said
the
foremost
stranger
to
the
forester
we
are
belated
travellers
on
our
way
from
guildford
to
windsor
and
seeing
your
cottage
have
called
to
obtain
some
refreshment
before
we
cross
the
great
park
we
do
not
ask
you
to
bestow
a
meal
upon
us
but
will
gladly
pay
for
the
best
your
larder
you
shall
have
it
and
welcome
my
masters
replied
tristram
but
i
am
afraid
my
humble
fare
will
scarcely
suit
fear
nothing
replied
the
other
we
have
good
appetites
and
are
not
over
dainty
beshrew
me
friend
he
added
regarding
mabel
you
have
a
comely
she
is
my
granddaughter
sir
replied
tristram
well
your
granddaughter
then
said
the
other
by
the
mass
a
lovely
wench
we
have
none
such
in
guildford
and
i
doubt
if
the
king
hath
such
in
windsor
castle
what
say
you
charles
brandon
it
were
treason
to
agree
with
you
harry
la
roy
replied
brandon
laughing
for
they
say
the
king
visits
with
the
halter
all
those
who
disparage
the
charms
of
the
lady
anne
boleyn
but
comparisons
apart
this
damsel
is
very
you
will
discompose
her
my
masters
if
you
praise
her
thus
to
her
face
said
tristram
somewhat
testily
here
mab
bring
forth
all
my
scanty
larder
affords
and
put
some
rashers
of
bacon
on
the
cold
meat
and
bread
will
suffice
for
us
said
harry
we
will
not
trouble
the
damsel
to
play
the
with
this
mabel
who
appeared
a
good
deal
embarrassed
by
the
presence
of
the
strangers
spread
a
cloth
of
linen
on
the
little
table
and
placed
the
remains
of
the
pie
and
a
large
oven
cake
before
them
the
sate
down
and
ate
heartily
of
the
humble
viands
he
who
had
answered
to
the
name
of
harry
frequently
stopping
in
the
course
of
his
repast
to
compliment
his
fair
attendant
by
our
lady
i
have
never
been
so
waited
on
before
he
added
rising
and
removing
his
stool
towards
the
fire
while
his
companion
took
up
a
position
with
his
back
against
the
wall
near
the
fireplace
and
now
my
pretty
mabel
have
you
never
a
cup
of
ale
to
wash
down
the
pie
i
can
offer
you
a
draught
of
right
good
mead
master
said
tristram
and
that
is
the
only
liquor
my
cottage
can
nothing
can
be
better
replied
harry
the
mead
by
all
while
mabel
went
to
draw
the
liquor
tristram
fixed
his
eyes
on
harry
whose
features
were
now
fully
revealed
by
the
light
of
the
fire
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
hard
friend
demanded
harry
bluffly
i
have
seen
some
one
very
like
you
master
replied
tristram
and
one
whom
it
is
no
light
honour
to
you
mean
the
king
returned
harry
laughing
you
are
not
the
first
person
who
has
thought
me
like
you
are
vain
of
the
likeness
i
see
master
replied
tristram
joining
in
the
laugh
how
say
you
mab
he
added
to
his
granddaughter
who
at
that
moment
returned
with
a
jug
and
a
couple
of
whom
does
this
gentleman
resemble
no
one
returned
mabel
without
raising
her
eyes
no
one
echoed
harry
chucking
her
under
the
chin
look
me
full
in
the
face
and
you
will
find
out
your
mistake
marry
if
i
were
the
royal
henry
instead
of
what
i
am
a
plain
guildford
merchant
i
should
prefer
you
to
anne
is
that
said
in
good
sooth
sir
asked
mabel
slightly
raising
her
eyes
and
instantly
dropping
them
before
the
ardent
gaze
of
the
merchant
in
good
sooth
and
sober
truth
replied
henry
rounding
his
arm
and
placing
his
hand
on
his
lusty
thigh
in
true
royal
fashion
were
you
the
royal
henry
i
should
not
care
for
your
preference
said
mabel
more
confidently
my
grandsire
says
the
king
changes
his
love
as
often
as
the
moon
changes
nay
god
death
your
grandsire
is
a
false
knave
to
say
so
cried
harry
heaven
help
us
you
swear
the
king
oaths
said
mabel
and
wherefore
not
sweetheart
said
harry
checking
himself
it
is
enough
to
make
one
swear
and
in
a
royal
fashion
too
to
hear
one
liege
lord
unjustly
accused
i
have
ever
heard
the
king
styled
a
mirror
of
constancy
how
say
you
charles
brandon
can
you
not
give
him
a
good
character
oh
an
excellent
character
said
brandon
he
is
constancy
itself
while
the
fit
lasts
he
added
aside
you
hear
what
my
friend
says
sweetheart
observed
harry
and
i
assure
you
he
has
the
best
opportunities
of
judging
but
i
be
sworn
you
did
not
believe
your
when
he
thus
maligned
the
she
contradicted
me
flatly
said
tristram
but
pour
out
the
mead
girl
our
guests
are
waiting
for
while
mabel
in
compliance
with
her
grandsire
directions
filled
the
horn
the
door
of
the
cottage
was
noiselessly
opened
by
morgan
fenwolf
who
stepped
in
followed
by
bawsey
he
stared
inquisitively
at
the
strangers
but
both
were
so
much
occupied
by
the
damsel
that
he
remained
unnoticed
a
sign
from
the
old
forester
told
him
he
had
better
retire
jealous
curiosity
however
detained
him
and
he
tarried
till
harry
had
received
the
cup
from
mabel
and
drained
it
to
her
health
he
then
drew
back
closed
the
door
softly
and
joined
a
dark
and
mysterious
figure
with
hideous
lineaments
and
an
antlered
helm
upon
its
brows
lurking
outside
the
cottage
meanwhile
a
cup
of
mead
having
been
offered
to
brandon
he
observed
to
his
companion
we
must
now
be
setting
forth
on
our
journey
night
is
advancing
and
we
have
five
long
miles
to
traverse
across
the
great
i
would
stay
where
i
am
rejoined
harry
and
make
a
bench
near
the
fire
serve
me
in
lieu
of
a
couch
but
that
business
requires
our
presence
at
the
castle
there
is
payment
for
our
meal
friend
he
added
giving
a
mark
to
tristram
and
as
we
shall
probably
return
night
we
will
call
and
have
another
supper
with
you
provide
us
a
capon
and
some
fish
from
the
you
pay
as
you
swear
good
sir
royally
replied
tristram
you
shall
have
a
better
supper
you
have
a
dangerous
journey
before
you
sir
said
mabel
they
say
there
are
plunderers
and
evil
spirits
in
the
great
i
have
no
fear
of
any
such
sweetheart
replied
harry
i
have
a
strong
arm
to
defend
myself
and
so
has
my
friend
charles
brandon
and
as
to
evil
spirits
a
kiss
from
you
will
shield
me
from
all
and
as
he
spoke
he
drew
her
towards
him
and
clasping
her
in
his
arms
imprinted
a
score
of
rapid
kisses
on
her
lips
hold
hold
master
cried
tristram
rising
angrily
this
may
not
be
is
an
arrant
abuse
of
nay
be
not
offended
good
friend
replied
harry
laughing
i
am
on
the
for
a
wife
and
i
know
not
but
i
may
take
your
granddaughter
with
me
to
she
is
not
to
be
so
lightly
won
cried
tristram
for
though
i
am
but
a
poor
forester
i
rate
her
as
highly
as
the
haughtiest
noble
can
rate
his
and
with
reason
said
harry
by
my
crown
suffolk
he
exclaimed
to
his
companion
as
he
quitted
the
cottage
she
is
an
angel
and
shall
be
not
if
my
arm
serves
me
truly
muttered
fenwolf
who
with
his
mysterious
companion
had
stationed
himself
at
the
window
of
the
hut
do
him
no
injury
returned
the
other
he
is
only
to
be
made
that
and
now
to
apprise
sir
thomas
wyat
we
must
intercept
them
before
they
reach
their
iv
how
herne
the
hunter
showed
the
earl
of
surrey
the
fair
geraldine
in
a
vision
on
the
third
day
after
surrey
imprisonment
in
the
keep
he
was
removed
to
the
norman
tower
the
chamber
allotted
him
was
square
tolerably
lofty
and
had
two
windows
on
either
side
looking
on
the
one
hand
into
the
upper
quadrangle
and
on
the
other
into
the
middle
ward
at
the
same
time
permission
was
accorded
him
to
take
exercise
on
the
battlements
of
the
round
tower
or
within
the
dry
and
grassy
moat
at
its
foot
the
fair
geraldine
he
was
informed
had
been
sent
to
the
royal
palace
at
greenwich
but
her
absence
occasioned
him
little
disquietude
because
he
knew
if
she
had
remained
at
windsor
he
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
see
her
on
the
same
day
that
surrey
was
removed
to
the
norman
tower
the
duke
of
richmond
quitted
the
castle
without
assigning
any
motive
for
his
departure
or
even
taking
leave
of
his
friend
at
first
some
jealous
mistrust
that
he
might
be
gone
to
renew
his
suit
to
the
fair
geraldine
troubled
the
earl
but
he
strongly
combated
the
feeling
as
calculated
if
indulged
to
destroy
his
tranquillity
and
by
fixing
his
thoughts
sedulously
on
other
subjects
he
speedily
succeeded
in
overcoming
it
on
that
night
while
occupied
in
a
translation
of
the
aeneid
which
he
had
commenced
he
remained
at
his
task
till
a
late
hour
the
midnight
bell
had
tolled
when
looking
up
he
was
startled
by
perceiving
a
tall
figure
standing
silent
and
motionless
beside
him
independently
of
the
difficulty
of
accounting
for
its
presence
the
appearance
of
the
figure
was
in
itself
sufficiently
appalling
it
was
above
the
ordinary
stature
and
was
enveloped
in
a
long
black
cloak
while
a
tall
conical
black
cap
which
added
to
its
height
and
increased
the
hideousness
of
its
features
covered
its
head
for
a
few
minutes
surrey
remained
gazing
at
the
figure
in
mute
astonishment
during
which
it
maintained
the
same
motionless
posture
at
length
he
was
able
to
murmur
forth
the
interrogation
who
art
thou
a
friend
replied
the
figure
in
a
sepulchral
tone
are
you
a
man
or
spirit
demanded
surrey
it
matters
not
i
am
a
friend
rejoined
the
figure
on
what
errand
come
you
here
asked
surrey
to
serve
you
replied
the
figure
to
liberate
you
you
shall
go
hence
with
me
if
you
on
what
condition
rejoined
surrey
we
will
speak
of
that
when
we
are
out
of
the
castle
and
on
the
green
sod
of
the
forest
returned
the
figure

in
vain
cried
surrey
i
will
not
go
with
you
i
recognise
in
you
the
demon
hunter
the
figure
laughed
hollowly
so
hollowly
that
surrey
flesh
crept
upon
his
bones

of
surrey
he
said

cried
surrey
indignantly
wyat
is
too
good
a
christian
and
too
worthy
a
knight
to
league
with
a
again
herne
laughed
bitterly
sir
thomas
wyat
told
you
he
would
seek
me
out
said
the
demon
he
did
so
and
gave
himself
to
me
for
anne
but
you
have
no
power
over
her
demon
cried
surrey
shuddering
you
will
learn
whether
i
have
or
not
in
due
time
replied
herne
do
you
refuse
to
go
with
me
i
refuse
to
deliver
myself
to
perdition
rejoined
the
earl
an
idle
fear
rejoined
herne
i

not
for
your
soul
you
will
destroy
it
without
my
aid
i
have
need
of
you

in

chamber
before

morning
and
no

aware
of
your
absence

or
i
will
bear
you

me
replied
surrey
placing
his
hand
upon
his
breast
i
am
armed
with
a
holy
i
know
it
said
herne
and
i
feel
its
power
or
i
would
not
have
trifled
with
you
thus
long
but
it
can
not
shield
you
from
a
rival
you
believe
the
fair
geraldine
constant
ha
i
know
her
to
be
so
said
surrey
a
derisive
laugh
broke
from
herne
peace
mocking
fiend
cried
surrey
furiously
i
laugh
to
think
how
you
are
deceived
said
herne
would
you
behold
your
mistress
now
would
you
see
how
she
conducts
herself
during
your
absence
if
you
choose
to
try
me
i
will
not
oppose
the
attempt
replied
surrey
but
it
will
be
remove
the
relic
from
your
person
rejoined
herne
place
it
upon
the
table
within
your
grasp
and
you
shall
see
surrey
hesitated
but
he
was
not
proof
against
the
low
mocking
laugh
of
the
demon
no
harm
can
result
from
it
he
cried
at
length
detaching
the
relic
from
his
neck
and
laying
it
on
the
table
extinguish
the
light
cried
herne
in
a
commanding
voice
surrey
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
and
dashed
the
lamp
off
the
table
behold
cried
the
demon
and
instantly
a
vision
representing
the
form
and
lineaments
of
the
fair
geraldine
to
the
life
shone
forth
against
the
opposite
wall
of
the
chamber
at
the
feet
of
the
visionary
damsel
knelt
a
shape
resembling
the
duke
of
richmond
he
was
pressing
the
hand
extended
to
him
by
the
fair
geraldine
to
his
lips
and
a
smile
of
triumph
irradiated
his
features
such
is
man
friendship
such
woman
constancy
cried
herne
are
you
now
satisfied
i
am
that
you
have
deceived
me
false
spirit
cried
the
earl
i
would
not
believe
the
fair
geraldine
inconstant
though
all
hell
told
me
a
terrible
laugh
broke
from
the
demon
and
the
vision
faded
away
all
became
perfect
darkness
and
for
a
few
moments
the
earl
remained
silent
he
then
called
to
the
demon
but
receiving
no
answer
put
forth
his
hand
towards
the
spot
where
he
had
stood
he
was
gone
confounded
surrey
returned
to
the
table
and
searched
for
the
relic
but
with
a
feeling
of
indescribable
anguish
and
found
that
it
had
likewise
disappeared
what
befell
sir
thomas
wyat
in
the
sandstone
cave
and
how
he
drank
a
maddening
potion
the
cave
in
which
sir
thomas
wyat
found
himself
on
the
removal
of
the
bandage
from
his
eyes
was
apparently
for
it
was
only
lighted
by
a
single
torch
of
considerable
width
and
extent
and
hewn
out
of
a
bed
of
soft
sandstone
the
roof
which
might
be
about
ten
feet
high
was
supported
by
the
trunks
of
three
large
trees
rudely
fashioned
into
pillars
there
were
several
narrow
lateral
passages
within
it
apparently
communicating
with
other
caverns
and
at
the
farther
end
which
was
almost
buried
in
obscurity
there
was
a
gleam
seemingly
occasioned
by
the
reflection
of
the
torchlight
upon
water
on
the
right
hand
stood
a
pile
of
huge
stones
disposed
somewhat
in
the
form
of
a
druidical
altar
on
the
top
of
which
as
on
a
throne
sat
the
demon
hunter
surrounded
by
his
satellites
one
of
whom
horned
and
bearded
like
a
satyr
had
clambered
the
roughened
sides
of
the
central
pillar
and
held
a
torch
over
the
captive
head
by
the
noxious
vapour
he
had
inhaled
and
blinded
by
the
tightness
of
the
bandage
it
was
some
time
before
wyat
fully
recovered
his
powers
of
sight
and
utterance
why
am
i
brought
hither
false
fiend
he
demanded
at
length
to
join
my
band
replied
the
demon
harshly
and
imperiously
never
rejoined
wyat
i
will
have
nought
to
do
with
you
except
as
regards
our
what
i
require
from
you
is
part
of
our
compact
rejoined
the
demon
he
who
has
once
closed
hands
with
herne
the
hunter
can
not
retreat
but
i
mean
you
fairly
and
will
not
delude
you
with
false
expectation
what
you
seek
can
not
be
accomplished
on
the
instant
ere
three
days
anne
boleyn
shall
be
give
me
some
proof
that
you
are
not
deceiving
me
spirit
said
wyat
come
then
replied
herne
so
saying
he
sprang
from
the
stone
and
taking
wyat
hand
led
him
towards
the
lower
end
of
the
cave
which
gradually
declined
till
it
reached
the
edge
of
a
small
but
apparently
deep
pool
of
water
the
level
of
which
rose
above
the
rock
that
formed
its
boundary
remove
the
torch
thundered
the
demon
to
those
behind
now
summon
your
false
love
sir
thomas
wyat
he
added
as
his
orders
were
obeyed
and
the
light
was
taken
into
one
of
the
side
passages
so
that
its
gleam
no
longer
fell
upon
the
water
appear
anne
boleyn
cried
wyat
upon
this
a
shadowy
resemblance
of
her
he
had
invoked
flitted
over
the
surface
of
the
water
with
hands
outstretched
towards
him
so
moved
was
wyat
by
the
vision
that
he
would
have
flung
himself
into
the
pool
to
grasp
it
if
he
had
not
been
forcibly
detained
by
the
demon
during
the
struggle
the
figure
vanished
and
all
was
buried
in
darkness
i
have
said
she
shall
be
yours
cried
herne
but
time
is
required
for
the
accomplishment
of
my
purpose
i
have
only
power
over
her
when
evil
is
predominant
in
her
heart
but
such
moments
are
not
unfrequent
he
added
with
a
bitter
laugh
and
now
to
the
chase
i
promise
you
it
will
be
a
wilder
and
more
exciting
ride
than
you
ever
enjoyed
in
the
company
to
the
chase
to
the
chase
i
say
sounding
a
call
upon
his
horn
the
light
instantly
reappeared
all
was
stir
and
confusion
amid
the
impish
troop
and
presently
afterwards
a
number
of
horses
and
hounds
of
the
same
hue
leashed
in
couples
were
brought
out
of
one
of
the
side
passages
among
the
latter
were
two
large
sable
hounds
of
saint
hubert
breed
whom
herne
summoned
to
his
side
by
the
names
of
saturn
and
dragon
a
slight
noise
as
of
a
blow
dealt
against
a
tree
was
now
heard
overhead
and
herne
imposing
silence
on
the
group
by
a
hasty
gesture
assumed
an
attitude
of
fixed
attention
the
stroke
was
repeated
a
second
time
it
is
our
brother
morgan
fenwolf
cried
the
demon
catching
hold
of
a
chain
hanging
from
the
roof
which
wyat
had
not
hitherto
noticed
he
swung
himself
into
a
crevice
above
and
disappeared
from
view
during
the
absence
of
their
leader
the
troop
remained
motionless
and
silent
a
few
minutes
afterwards
herne
reappeared
at
the
upper
end
of
the
cave
he
was
accompanied
by
fenwolf
between
whom
and
wyat
a
slight
glance
of
recognition
passed
the
order
being
given
by
the
demon
to
mount
wyat
after
an
hesitation
seized
the
flowing
mane
of
the
horse
nearest
him
for
it
was
furnished
neither
with
saddle
nor
vaulted
upon
its
back
at
the
same
moment
herne
uttered
a
wild
cry
and
plunging
into
the
pool
sunk
within
it
wyat
steed
followed
and
swam
swiftly
forward
beneath
the
water
when
wyat
rose
to
the
surface
he
found
himself
in
the
open
lake
which
was
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
before
him
he
beheld
herne
clambering
the
bank
accompanied
by
his
two
favourite
hounds
while
a
large
white
owl
wheeled
round
his
head
hooting
loudly
behind
came
the
grisly
cavalcade
with
their
hounds
swimming
from
beneath
a
bank
covered
by
thick
overhanging
trees
which
completely
screened
the
secret
entrance
to
the
cave
having
no
control
over
his
steed
wyat
was
obliged
to
surrender
himself
to
its
guidance
and
was
soon
placed
by
the
side
of
the
demon
hunter
pledge
me
sir
thomas
wyat
said
herne
unslinging
a
flask
from
his
girdle
and
offering
it
to
him
is
a
rare
wine
and
will
prevent
you
from
suffering
from
your
bath
as
well
as
give
you
spirits
for
the
chilled
to
the
bone
by
the
immersion
he
had
undergone
wyat
did
not
refuse
the
offer
but
placing
the
flask
to
his
lips
took
a
deep
draught
from
it
the
demon
uttered
a
low
bitter
laugh
as
he
received
back
the
flask
and
he
slung
it
to
his
girdle
without
tasting
it
the
effect
of
the
potion
upon
wyat
was
extraordinary
the
whole
scene
seemed
to
dance
around
him
impish
figures
in
the
lake
or
upon
its
bank
assumed
forms
yet
more
fantastic
the
horses
looked
like
monsters
of
the
deep
the
hounds
like
wolves
and
ferocious
beasts
the
branches
of
the
trees
writhed
and
shot
forward
like
hissing
serpents
and
though
this
effect
speedily
passed
off
it
left
behind
it
a
wild
and
maddening
feeling
of
excitement
a
noble
hart
is
lying
in
yon
glen
said
morgan
fenwolf
advancing
towards
his
leader
i
tracked
his
slot
thither
this
haste
and
unharbour
him
replied
herne
and
as
soon
as
you
rouse
him
give
the
fenwolf
obeyed
and
shortly
afterwards
a
cry
was
heard
from
the
glen
list
halloa
list
halloa
cried
herne
that
he
that
he
hyke
saturn
hyke
dragon
away
away
my
merry
men
vi
how
sir
thomas
wyat
hunted
with
herne
accompanied
by
wyat
and
followed
by
the
whole
cavalcade
herne
dashed
into
the
glen
where
fenwolf
awaited
him
threading
the
hollow
the
troop
descried
the
hart
flying
swiftly
along
a
sweeping
glade
at
some
two
hundred
yards
distance
the
glade
was
passed
a
woody
knoll
skirted
a
valley
traversed
and
the
hart
plunged
into
a
thick
grove
clothing
the
side
of
hawk
hill
but
it
offered
him
no
secure
retreat
dragon
and
saturn
were
close
upon
him
and
behind
them
came
herne
crashing
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
heedless
of
all
impediments
the
thicket
became
more
open
and
they
entered
cranbourne
chase
but
the
hart
soon
quitted
it
to
return
to
the
great
park
and
darted
down
a
declivity
skirted
by
a
line
of
noble
oaks
here
he
was
so
hotly
pressed
by
his
fierce
opponents
whose
fangs
he
could
almost
feel
within
his
haunches
that
he
suddenly
stopped
and
stood
at
bay
receiving
the
foremost
of
his
assailants
saturn
on
the
points
of
his
horns
but
his
defence
though
gallant
was
unavailing
in
another
instant
herne
came
up
and
dismounting
called
off
dragon
who
was
about
to
take
the
place
of
his
wounded
companion
drawing
a
knife
from
his
girdle
the
hunter
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
advancing
on
all
fours
towards
the
hart
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
himself
from
some
denizen
of
the
forest
as
he
approached
the
hart
snorted
and
bellowed
fiercely
and
dashed
its
horns
against
him
but
the
blow
was
received
by
the
hunter
upon
his
own
antlered
helm
and
at
the
same
moment
his
knife
was
thrust
to
the
hilt
into
the
stag
throat
and
it
fell
to
the
ground
springing
to
his
feet
herne
whooped
joyfully
placed
his
bugle
to
his
lips
and
blew
the
dead
mot
he
then
shouted
to
fenwolf
to
call
away
and
couple
the
hounds
and
striking
off
the
deer
right
forefoot
with
his
knife
presented
it
to
wyat
several
large
leafy
branches
being
gathered
and
laid
upon
the
ground
the
hart
was
placed
upon
them
and
herne
commenced
breaking
him
up
as
the
process
of
dismembering
the
deer
is
termed
in
the
language
of
woodcraft
his
first
step
was
to
cut
off
the
animal
head
which
he
performed
by
a
single
blow
with
his
heavy
trenchant
knife
give
the
hounds
the
flesh
he
said
delivering
the
trophy
to
fenwolf
but
keep
the
antlers
for
it
is
a
great
deer
of
placing
the
head
on
a
fenwolf
withdrew
to
an
open
space
among
the
trees
and
halloing
to
the
others
they
immediately
cast
off
the
hounds
who
rushed
towards
him
leaping
and
baying
at
the
stag
head
which
he
alternately
raised
and
lowered
until
they
were
sufficiently
excited
when
he
threw
it
on
the
ground
before
them
while
this
was
going
forward
the
rest
of
the
band
were
occupied
in
various
ways
some
striking
a
light
with
flint
and
steel
some
gathering
together
sticks
and
dried
leaves
to
form
a
fire
others
producing
various
cooking
utensils
while
others
were
assisting
their
leader
in
his
butcherly
task
which
he
executed
with
infinite
skill
and
expedition
as
soon
as
the
fire
was
kindled
herne
distributed
certain
portions
of
the
venison
among
his
followers
which
were
instantly
thrown
upon
the
embers
to
broil
while
a
few
choice
morsels
were
stewed
in
a
pan
with
wine
and
subsequently
offered
to
the
leader
and
wyat
this
hasty
repast
concluded
the
demon
ordered
the
fire
to
be
extinguished
and
the
quarters
of
the
deer
to
be
carried
to
the
cave
he
then
mounted
his
steed
and
attended
by
wyat
and
the
rest
of
his
troop
except
those
engaged
in
executing
his
orders
galloped
towards
snow
hill
where
he
speedily
succeeded
in
unharbouring
another
noble
hart
away
then
went
the
whole
party
stag
hounds
huntsmen
sweeping
like
a
dark
cloud
down
the
hill
and
crossing
the
wide
moonlit
glade
studded
with
noble
trees
on
the
west
of
the
great
avenue
for
a
while
the
hart
held
a
course
parallel
with
the
avenue
he
then
dashed
across
it
threaded
the
intricate
woods
on
the
opposite
side
tracked
a
long
glen
and
leaping
the
pales
entered
the
home
park
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
designed
to
seek
shelter
within
the
castle
for
he
made
straight
towards
it
and
was
only
diverted
by
herne
himself
who
shooting
past
him
with
incredible
swiftness
turned
him
towards
the
lower
part
of
the
park
here
the
chase
continued
with
unabated
ardour
until
reaching
the
banks
of
the
thames
the
hart
plunged
into
it
and
suffered
himself
to
be
carried
noiselessly
down
the
current
but
herne
followed
him
along
the
banks
and
when
sufficiently
near
dashed
into
the
stream
and
drove
him
again
ashore
once
more
they
flew
across
the
home
park
once
more
they
leaped
its
pales
once
more
they
entered
the
great
park
but
this
time
the
stag
took
the
direction
of
englefield
green
he
was
not
however
allowed
to
break
forth
into
the
open
country
but
driven
again
into
the
thick
woods
he
held
on
with
wondrous
speed
till
the
lake
appeared
in
view
in
another
instant
he
was
swimming
across
it
before
the
eddies
occasioned
by
the
affrighted
animal
plunge
had
described
a
wide
ring
herne
had
quitted
his
steed
and
was
cleaving
with
rapid
strokes
the
waters
of
the
lake
finding
escape
impossible
the
hart
turned
to
meet
him
and
sought
to
strike
him
with
his
horns
but
as
in
the
case
of
his
brother
of
the
wood
the
blow
was
warded
by
the
antlered
helm
of
the
swimmer
the
next
moment
the
clear
water
was
dyed
with
blood
and
herne
catching
the
gasping
animal
by
the
head
guided
his
body
to
shore
again
the
process
of
breaking
up
the
stag
was
gone
through
and
when
herne
had
concluded
his
task
he
once
more
offered
his
gourd
to
sir
thomas
wyat
reckless
of
the
consequences
the
knight
placed
the
flask
to
his
lips
and
draining
it
to
the
last
drop
fell
from
his
horse
insensible
vii
how
wyat
beheld
mabel
lyndwood
and
how
he
was
rowed
by
morgan
fenwolf
upon
the
lake
when
perfect
consciousness
returned
to
him
wyat
found
himself
lying
upon
a
pallet
in
what
he
first
took
to
be
the
cell
of
an
anchorite
but
as
the
recollection
of
recent
events
arose
more
distinctly
before
him
he
guessed
it
to
be
a
chamber
connected
with
the
sandstone
cave
a
small
lamp
placed
in
a
recess
lighted
the
cell
and
upon
a
footstool
by
his
bed
stood
a
jug
of
water
and
a
cup
containing
some
drink
in
which
herbs
had
evidently
been
infused
emptying
the
jug
for
he
felt
parched
with
thirst
wyat
attired
himself
took
up
the
lamp
and
walked
into
the
main
cavern
no
one
was
there
nor
could
he
obtain
any
answer
to
his
calls
evidences
however
were
not
wanting
to
prove
that
a
feast
had
recently
been
held
there
on
one
side
were
the
scarcely
extinguished
embers
of
a
large
wood
fire
and
in
the
midst
of
the
chamber
was
a
rude
table
covered
with
and
wooden
platters
as
well
as
with
the
remains
of
three
or
four
haunches
of
venison
while
contemplating
this
scene
wyat
heard
footsteps
in
one
of
the
lateral
passages
and
presently
afterwards
morgan
fenwolf
made
his
appearance
so
you
are
come
round
at
last
sir
thomas
observed
the
keeper
in
a
slightly
sarcastic
tone
what
has
ailed
me
asked
wyat
in
surprise
you
have
had
a
fever
for
three
days
returned
fenwolf
and
have
been
raving
like
a
three
days
muttered
wyat
the
false
juggling
fiend
promised
her
to
me
on
the
third
fear
not
herne
will
be
as
good
as
his
word
said
fenwolf
but
will
you
go
forth
with
me
i
am
about
to
visit
my
nets
it
is
a
fine
day
and
a
row
on
the
lake
will
do
you
wyat
acquiesced
and
followed
fenwolf
who
returned
along
the
passage
it
grew
narrower
at
the
sides
and
lower
in
the
roof
as
they
advanced
until
at
last
they
were
compelled
to
move
forward
on
their
hands
and
knees
for
some
space
the
passage
or
rather
hole
for
it
was
nothing
more
ran
on
a
level
a
steep
and
tortuous
ascent
then
commenced
which
brought
them
to
an
outlet
concealed
by
a
large
stone
pushing
it
aside
fenwolf
crept
forth
and
immediately
afterwards
wyat
emerged
into
a
grove
through
which
on
one
side
the
gleaming
waters
of
the
lake
were
discernible
the
keeper
first
business
was
to
replace
the
stone
which
was
so
screened
by
brambles
and
bushes
that
it
could
not
unless
careful
search
were
made
be
detected
making
his
way
through
the
trees
to
the
side
of
the
lake
fenwolf
marched
along
the
greensward
in
the
direction
of
tristram
cottage
wyat
mechanically
followed
him
but
he
was
so
that
he
scarcely
heeded
the
fair
mabel
nor
was
it
till
after
his
embarkation
in
the
skiff
with
the
keeper
when
she
came
forth
to
look
at
them
that
he
was
at
all
struck
with
her
beauty
he
then
inquired
her
name
from
fenwolf
she
is
called
mabel
lyndwood
and
is
an
old
forester
granddaughter
replied
the
other
somewhat
gruffly
and
do
you
seek
her
love
asked
wyat
ay
and
wherefore
not
asked
fenwolf
with
a
look
of
displeasure
nay
i
know
not
friend
rejoined
wyat
she
is
a
comely
what
comelier
than
the
lady
anne
demanded
fenwolf
spitefully
i
said
not
so
replied
wyat
but
she
is
very
fair
and
looks
fenwolf
glanced
at
him
from
under
his
brows
and
plunging
his
oars
into
the
water
soon
carried
him
out
of
sight
of
the
maiden
it
was
high
noon
and
the
day
was
one
of
resplendent
loveliness
the
lake
sparkled
in
the
sunshine
and
as
they
shot
past
its
tiny
bays
and
woody
headlands
new
beauties
were
every
moment
revealed
to
them
but
while
the
scene
softened
wyat
feelings
it
filled
him
with
intolerable
remorse
and
so
poignant
did
his
emotions
become
that
he
pressed
his
hands
upon
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
lovely
prospect
when
he
looked
up
again
the
scene
was
changed
the
skiff
had
entered
a
narrow
creek
arched
over
by
huge
trees
and
looking
as
dark
and
gloomy
as
the
rest
of
the
lake
was
fair
and
smiling
it
was
closed
in
by
a
high
overhanging
bank
crested
by
two
tall
trees
whose
tangled
roots
protruded
through
it
like
monstrous
reptiles
while
their
branches
cast
a
heavy
shade
over
the
deep
sluggish
water
why
have
you
come
here
demanded
wyat
looking
uneasily
round
the
forbidding
spot
you
will
discover
anon
replied
fenwolf
moodily
go
back
into
the
sunshine
and
take
me
to
some
pleasant
bank
i
will
not
land
here
said
wyat
sternly
needs
must
when
i
need
not
remind
you
of
the
proverb
rejoined
fenwolf
with
a
sneer
give
me
the
oars
thou
malapert
knave
cried
wyat
fiercely
and
i
will
put
myself
keep
quiet
said
fenwolf
you
must
perforce
abide
our
wyat
gazed
at
the
keeper
for
a
moment
as
if
with
the
intention
of
throwing
him
overboard
but
abandoning
the
idea
he
rose
up
in
the
boat
and
caught
at
what
he
took
to
be
a
root
of
the
tree
above
to
his
surprise
and
alarm
it
closed
upon
him
with
an
iron
grasp
and
he
felt
himself
dragged
upwards
while
the
skiff
impelled
by
a
sudden
stroke
from
morgan
fenwolf
shot
from
beneath
him
all
wyat
efforts
to
disengage
himself
were
vain
and
a
wild
demoniacal
laugh
echoed
by
a
chorus
of
voices
proclaimed
him
in
the
power
of
herne
the
hunter
the
next
moment
he
was
set
on
the
top
of
the
bank
while
the
demon
greeted
him
with
a
mocking
laugh
so
you
thought
to
escape
me
sir
thomas
wyatt
he
cried
in
a
taunting
tone
but
any
such
attempt
will
prove
fruitless
the
murderer
may
repent
the
blow
when
dealt
the
thief
may
desire
to
restore
the
gold
he
has
purloined
the
barterer
of
his
soul
may
rue
his
bargain
but
they
are
satan
nevertheless
you
are
mine
and
nothing
can
redeem
you
woe
is
me
that
it
should
be
so
groaned
wyat
lamentation
is
useless
and
unworthy
of
you
rejoined
herne
scornfully
your
wish
will
be
speedily
accomplished
this
very
night
your
kingly
rival
shall
be
placed
in
your
ha
exclaimed
wyat
the
flame
of
jealousy
again
rising
within
his
breast
you
can
make
your
own
terms
with
him
for
the
lady
anne
pursued
herne
his
life
will
be
at
your
do
you
promise
this
cried
wyat
ay
replied
herne
put
yourself
under
the
conduct
of
fenwolf
and
all
shall
happen
as
you
desire
we
shall
meet
again
at
night
i
have
other
business
on
hand
now
meschines
he
added
to
one
of
his
attendants
go
with
sir
thomas
to
the
the
personage
who
received
the
command
and
who
was
wildly
and
fantastically
habited
beckoned
wyat
to
follow
him
and
after
many
twistings
and
turnings
brought
them
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
where
the
skiff
was
lying
with
fenwolf
reclining
at
full
length
upon
its
benches
he
arose
however
quickly
at
the
appearance
of
meschines
and
asked
him
for
some
provisions
which
the
latter
promised
to
bring
and
while
wyat
got
into
the
skiff
he
disappeared
but
returned
a
few
minutes
afterwards
with
a
basket
which
he
gave
to
the
keeper
crossing
the
lake
fenwolf
then
shaped
his
course
towards
a
verdant
bank
enamelled
with
wild
flowers
where
he
landed
the
basket
being
opened
was
found
to
contain
a
flask
of
wine
and
the
better
part
of
a
venison
pasty
of
which
wyat
whose
appetite
was
keen
enough
after
his
long
fasting
ate
heartily
he
then
stretched
himself
on
the
velvet
sod
and
dropped
into
a
tranquil
slumber
which
lasted
to
a
late
hour
in
the
evening
he
was
roused
from
it
by
a
hand
laid
on
his
shoulder
while
a
deep
voice
thundered
in
his
ear
up
up
sir
thomas
and
follow
me
and
i
will
place
the
king
in
your
hands
viii
how
the
king
and
the
duke
of
suffolk
were
assailed
by
herne
band
and
what
followed
the
attack
henry
and
suffolk
on
leaving
the
forester
hut
took
their
way
for
a
sort
space
along
the
side
of
the
lake
and
then
turned
into
a
path
leading
through
the
trees
up
the
eminence
on
the
left
the
king
was
in
a
joyous
mood
and
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
passion
with
which
the
fair
damsel
had
inspired
him
i
faith
he
cried
the
cardinal
has
a
quick
eye
for
a
pretty
wench
i
have
heard
that
he
loves
one
in
secret
and
i
am
therefore
the
more
beholden
to
him
for
discovering
mabel
to
you
forget
my
liege
that
it
is
his
object
to
withdraw
your
regards
from
the
lady
anne
boleyn
remarked
suffolk
i
care
not
what
his
motive
may
be
as
long
as
the
result
is
so
satisfactory
returned
henry
confess
now
suffolk
you
never
beheld
a
figure
so
perfect
a
complexion
so
blooming
or
eyes
so
bright
as
to
her
lips
by
my
soul
i
never
tasted
and
your
majesty
is
not
inexperienced
in
such
matters
laughed
suffolk
for
my
own
part
i
was
as
much
struck
by
her
grace
as
by
her
beauty
and
can
scarcely
persuade
myself
she
can
be
nothing
more
than
a
mere
forester
wolsey
told
me
there
was
a
mystery
about
her
birth
rejoined
henry
but
pest
on
it
her
beauty
drove
all
recollection
of
the
matter
out
of
my
head
i
will
go
back
and
question
her
your
majesty
forgets
that
your
absence
from
the
castle
will
occasion
surprise
if
not
alarm
said
suffolk
the
mystery
will
keep
till
tut
tut
i
will
return
said
the
king
perversely
and
suffolk
knowing
his
wilfulness
and
that
all
remonstrance
would
prove
fruitless
retraced
his
steps
with
him
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
they
perceived
a
female
figure
at
the
bottom
of
the
ascent
just
where
the
path
turned
off
on
the
margin
of
the
lake
as
i
live
there
she
is
exclaimed
the
king
joyfully
she
has
divined
my
wishes
and
is
come
herself
to
tell
me
her
and
he
sprang
forward
while
mabel
advanced
rapidly
towards
him
they
met
and
henry
would
have
caught
her
in
his
arms
but
she
avoided
him
exclaiming
in
a
tone
of
confusion
and
alarm
thank
heaven
i
have
found
you
sire
thank
heaven
too
sweetheart
rejoined
henry
i
would
not
hide
when
you
are
the
seeker
so
you
know
me
ha
i
knew
you
at
first
replied
mabel
confusedly
i
saw
you
at
the
great
hunting
party
and
once
beheld
your
majesty
is
not
easily
ha
by
saint
george
you
turn
a
compliment
as
soothly
as
the
most
practised
dame
at
court
cried
henry
catching
her
hand
beseech
your
majesty
release
me
returned
mabel
struggling
to
get
free
i
did
not
follow
you
on
the
light
errand
you
suppose
but
to
warn
you
of
danger
before
you
quitted
my
grandsire
cottage
i
told
you
this
part
of
the
forest
was
haunted
by
plunderers
and
evil
beings
and
apprehensive
lest
some
mischance
might
befall
you
i
opened
the
window
softly
to
look
after
you
and
you
overheard
me
tell
the
duke
of
suffolk
how
much
smitten
i
was
with
your
beauty
ha
interrupted
the
king
squeezing
her
hand
and
how
resolved
i
was
to
make
you
mine
ha
sweetheart
the
words
i
heard
were
of
very
different
import
my
liege
rejoined
mabel
you
were
menaced
by
miscreants
who
purposed
to
waylay
you
before
you
could
reach
your
let
them
come
replied
henry
carelessly
they
shall
pay
for
their
villainy
how
many
were
there
two
sire
answered
mabel
but
one
of
them
was
herne
the
weird
hunter
of
the
forest
he
said
he
would
summon
his
band
to
make
you
captive
what
can
your
strong
arm
even
aided
by
that
of
the
duke
of
suffolk
avail
against
numbers
captive
ha
exclaimed
the
king
said
the
knave
so
he
did
sire
replied
mabel
and
i
knew
it
was
herne
by
his
antlered
there
is
reason
in
what
the
damsel
says
my
liege
interposed
suffolk
if
possible
you
had
better
avoid
an
encounter
with
the
my
hands
itch
to
give
them
a
lesson
rejoined
henry
but
i
will
be
ruled
by
you
god
death
i
will
return
and
hunt
them
down
like
so
many
where
are
your
horses
sire
asked
mabel
tied
to
a
tree
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
replied
henry
but
i
have
attendants
midway
between
this
spot
and
snow
this
way
then
said
mabel
breaking
from
him
and
darting
into
a
narrow
path
among
the
trees
henry
ran
after
her
but
was
not
agile
enough
to
overtake
her
at
length
she
stopped
if
your
majesty
will
pursue
this
path
she
cried
you
will
come
to
an
open
space
amid
the
trees
when
if
you
will
direct
your
course
towards
a
large
on
the
opposite
side
you
will
find
another
narrow
path
which
will
take
you
where
you
desire
to
but
i
can
not
go
alone
cried
henry
mabel
however
slipped
past
him
and
was
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
henry
looked
as
if
he
meant
to
follow
her
but
suffolk
ventured
to
arrest
him
do
not
tarry
here
longer
my
gracious
liege
said
the
duke
danger
is
to
be
apprehended
and
the
sooner
you
rejoin
your
attendants
the
better
return
with
them
if
you
please
but
do
not
expose
yourself
further
henry
yielded
though
reluctantly
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
ere
long
they
arrived
at
the
open
space
described
by
mabel
and
immediately
perceived
the
large
behind
which
they
found
the
path
by
this
time
the
moon
had
arisen
and
as
they
emerged
upon
the
marsh
they
easily
discovered
a
track
though
not
broader
than
a
leading
along
its
edge
as
they
hurried
across
it
suffolk
occasionally
cast
a
furtive
glance
over
his
shoulder
but
he
saw
nothing
to
alarm
him
the
whole
tract
of
marshy
land
on
the
left
was
hidden
from
view
by
a
silvery
mist
in
a
few
minutes
the
king
and
his
companion
gained
firmer
ground
and
ascending
the
gentle
elevation
on
the
other
side
of
the
marsh
made
their
way
to
a
little
knoll
crowned
by
a
huge
oak
which
commanded
a
fine
view
of
the
lake
winding
through
the
valley
beyond
henry
who
was
a
few
yards
in
advance
of
his
companion
paused
at
a
short
distance
from
the
free
and
being
somewhat
took
off
his
cap
to
wipe
his
brow
laughingly
observing
in
good
truth
suffolk
we
must
henceforth
be
rated
as
miserable
faineants
to
be
scared
from
our
path
by
a
silly
wench
tale
of
deerstealers
and
wild
huntsmen
i
am
sorry
i
yielded
to
her
entreaties
if
herne
be
still
extant
he
must
be
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
old
for
unless
the
legend
is
false
he
flourished
in
the
time
of
my
predecessor
richard
the
second
i
would
i
could
see
him
behold
him
then
cried
a
harsh
voice
from
behind
turning
at
the
sound
henry
perceived
a
tall
dark
figure
of
hideous
physiognomy
and
strange
attire
helmed
with
a
huge
pair
of
antlers
standing
between
him
and
the
so
sudden
was
the
appearance
of
the
figure
that
in
spite
of
himself
the
king
slightly
started
what
art
thou
ha
he
demanded
what
i
have
said
replied
the
demon
i
am
herne
the
hunter
welcome
to
my
domain
harry
of
england
you
are
lord
of
the
castle
but
i
am
lord
of
the
forest
ha
ha
i
am
lord
both
of
the
forest
and
the
castle
yea
of
all
this
broad
land
false
fiend
cried
the
king
and
none
shall
dispute
it
with
me
in
the
name
of
the
most
holy
faith
of
which
i
am
the
defender
i
command
thee
to
avoid
my
path
get
thee
backwards
satan
the
demon
laughed
derisively
harry
of
england
advance
towards
me
and
you
advance
upon
your
peril
he
rejoined
avaunt
i
say
cried
the
king
in
the
name
of
the
blessed
trinity
and
of
all
holy
angels
and
saints
i
strike
and
he
whirled
the
staff
round
his
head
but
ere
the
weapon
could
descend
a
flash
of
dazzling
fire
encircled
the
demon
amidst
which
he
vanished
heaven
protect
us
exclaimed
henry
appalled
at
this
juncture
the
sound
of
a
horn
was
heard
and
a
number
of
wild
figures
in
fantastic
garbs
some
mounted
on
swarthy
steeds
and
accompanied
by
hounds
others
on
from
the
adjoining
covert
and
hurried
towards
the
spot
occupied
by
the
king
aha
exclaimed
henry
more
of
the
same
sort
hell
it
would
seem
has
let
loose
her
hosts
but
i
have
no
fear
of
them
stand
by
me
to
the
death
sire
replied
the
duke
drawing
his
sword
by
this
time
one
of
the
foremost
of
the
impish
crew
had
reached
the
king
and
commanded
him
to
yield
himself
prisoner
dost
know
whom
thou
askest
to
yield
dog
cried
henry
furiously
yea
replied
the
other
thou
art
the
king
then
down
on
thy
knees
traitor
roared
henry
down
all
of
ye
and
sue
for
for
mercy
ha
ha
rejoined
the
other
it
is
thy
turn
to
sue
for
mercy
tyrant
we
acknowledge
no
other
ruler
than
herne
the
then
seek
him
in
hell
cried
henry
dealing
the
speaker
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
head
with
his
staff
which
brought
him
senseless
to
the
ground
the
others
immediately
closed
round
him
and
endeavoured
to
seize
the
king
ha
dogs
ha
traitors
vociferated
henry
plying
his
staff
with
great
activity
and
bringing
down
an
assailant
at
each
stroke
do
you
dare
to
lay
hands
upon
our
sacred
person
back
back
the
determined
resistance
offered
by
the
king
supported
as
he
was
by
suffolk
paralysed
his
assailants
who
seemed
more
bent
upon
securing
his
person
than
doing
him
injury
but
suffolk
attention
was
presently
diverted
by
the
attack
of
a
fierce
black
hound
set
upon
him
by
a
stout
fellow
in
a
bearded
mask
after
a
hard
struggle
and
not
before
he
had
been
severely
bitten
in
the
arm
the
duke
contrived
to
despatch
his
assailant
this
to
avenge
poor
bawsey
cried
the
man
who
had
set
on
the
hound
stabbing
at
suffolk
with
his
knife
but
the
duke
parried
the
blow
and
disarming
his
antagonist
forced
him
to
the
ground
and
tearing
off
his
mask
disclosed
the
features
of
morgan
fenwolf
meanwhile
henry
had
been
placed
in
considerable
jeopardy
like
suffolk
he
had
slaughtered
a
hound
and
in
aiming
a
blow
at
the
villain
who
set
it
on
his
foot
slipped
and
he
lay
at
his
mercy
the
wretch
raised
his
knife
and
was
in
the
act
of
striking
when
a
sword
was
passed
through
his
body
the
blow
was
decisive
the
king
instantly
arose
and
the
rest
of
his
as
well
as
foot
disheartened
by
what
had
occurred
beat
a
hasty
retreat
harry
turned
to
look
for
his
deliverer
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
anger
ah
god
death
he
cried
can
i
believe
my
eyes
is
it
you
sir
thomas
wyat
ay
replied
the
other
what
do
you
here
ha
demanded
the
king
you
should
be
in
i
have
tarried
for
revenge
replied
wyat
revenge
ha
cried
henry
on
whom
on
you
replied
wyat
what
vociferated
henry
foaming
with
rage
is
it
you
traitor
who
have
devised
this
damnable
plot
is
it
you
who
would
make
your
king
a
captive
you
who
slay
him
have
you
leagued
yourself
with
fiends
but
wyat
made
no
answer
and
though
he
lowered
the
point
of
his
sword
he
regarded
the
king
sternly
a
female
figure
now
rushed
forward
and
bending
before
the
king
cried
in
an
imploring
voice
spare
him
sire
spare
him
he
is
no
party
to
the
attack
i
was
near
him
in
yon
wood
and
he
stirred
not
forth
till
he
saw
your
life
in
danger
he
then
delivered
you
from
the
i
did
so
because
i
reserved
him
for
my
own
hand
said
wyat
you
hear
him
confess
his
treason
cried
henry
down
on
your
knees
villain
or
i
will
strike
you
to
my
he
has
just
saved
your
life
my
liege
cried
the
supplicant
oh
spare
him
what
make
you
here
mabel
cried
henry
angrily
i
followed
your
majesty
unseen
she
replied
in
some
confusion
and
reached
yon
wood
just
as
the
attack
commenced
i
did
not
dare
to
advance
you
should
have
gone
home
gone
home
rejoined
the
king
wyat
he
continued
in
a
tone
of
stern
reproach
you
were
once
a
loyal
subject
what
means
this
change
it
means
that
you
have
robbed
me
of
a
mistress
replied
wyat
and
for
this
cause
i
have
damned
pardon
him
pardon
him
sire
cried
mabel
i
can
not
understand
you
wyat
said
henry
after
a
pause
but
i
have
myself
suffered
from
the
pangs
of
jealousy
you
have
saved
my
life
and
i
will
spare
sire
cried
wyat
suffolk
exclaimed
henry
looking
towards
the
duke
who
was
holding
fenwolf
by
the
throat
shall
i
be
justified
in
letting
him
go
free
strike
strike
cried
a
deep
voice
in
wyat
ear
your
rival
is
now
in
your
far
be
it
from
me
to
thwart
your
majesty
generous
impulses
rejoined
suffolk
it
is
true
that
wyat
has
saved
your
life
and
if
he
had
been
disposed
to
take
it
you
have
this
moment
exposed
yourself
to
sir
thomas
wyat
said
the
king
turning
to
him
you
have
my
full
and
free
pardon
quit
this
forest
instantly
and
make
your
way
to
paris
if
you
are
found
within
it
you
will
be
lodged
in
the
wyat
knelt
down
and
would
have
pressed
henry
hand
to
his
lips
but
the
latter
pushed
him
aside
no
no
not
now
on
your
thus
rebuffed
wyat
strode
away
and
as
he
passed
the
tree
he
heard
a
voice
exclaim
you
have
escaped
him
but
think
not
to
escape
me
and
now
sweetheart
said
henry
turning
to
mabel
since
you
are
so
far
on
the
way
you
shall
go
with
me
to
the
on
no
account
my
liege
she
returned
my
grandsire
will
wonder
what
has
become
of
me
he
must
already
be
in
great
but
i
will
send
an
attendant
to
quiet
his
fears
urged
henry
that
would
only
serve
to
increase
them
she
rejoined
nay
i
must
and
breaking
from
him
she
darted
swiftly
down
the
hill
and
glanced
across
the
marsh
like
a
moonbeam
plague
on
it
cried
henry
i
have
again
forgotten
to
question
her
about
her
shall
i
despatch
this
knave
my
liege
cried
suffolk
pointing
with
his
sword
to
fenwolf
by
no
means
said
the
king
something
may
be
learnt
from
him
hark
thee
thou
felon
hound
if
thou
indeed
servest
the
fiend
thou
seest
he
deserts
thee
as
he
does
all
who
put
faith
in
i
see
it
replied
fenwolf
who
finding
resistance
vain
had
folded
his
hands
doggedly
upon
his
breast
then
confess
thy
evil
practices
said
the
king
give
me
my
life
and
i
will
replied
fenwolf
and
as
he
uttered
the
words
he
caught
sight
of
the
dark
figure
of
herne
stationed
at
the
side
of
the
oak
with
its
right
arm
raised
menacingly
what
seest
thou
cried
henry
remarking
his
fixed
gaze
towards
the
tree
and
glancing
in
that
direction
fenwolf
made
no
reply
henry
went
up
to
the
tree
and
walked
round
it
but
he
could
see
nothing
i
will
scour
the
forest
he
muttered
and
hang
every
knave
i
find
within
it
who
can
not
give
a
good
account
of
ho
ho
ho
laughed
a
voice
which
seemed
to
proceed
from
the
branches
of
the
tree
henry
looked
up
but
no
one
was
visible
god
death
derided
he
roared
man
or
devil
thou
shalt
feel
my
ho
ho
ho
again
laughed
the
voice
stamping
with
rage
henry
swore
a
great
oath
and
smote
the
trunk
of
the
tree
with
his
sword
your
majesty
will
search
in
vain
said
suffolk
it
is
clearly
the
fiend
with
whom
you
have
to
deal
and
the
aid
of
holy
priests
must
be
obtained
to
drive
him
from
the
ho
ho
ho
again
laughed
the
voice
a
party
of
horsemen
now
appeared
in
view
they
proved
to
be
the
royal
attendants
who
had
ridden
forward
in
search
of
the
king
and
were
instantly
hailed
by
henry
and
suffolk
they
were
headed
by
captain
bouchier
who
at
a
sign
from
the
king
instantly
dismounted
give
me
your
horse
bouchier
said
henry
and
do
you
and
of
your
men
remain
on
guard
at
this
tree
till
i
send
a
troop
of
arquebusiers
to
relieve
you
when
they
arrive
station
them
near
it
and
let
them
remain
here
till
i
return
in
the
morning
if
any
one
appears
make
him
a
your
majesty
orders
shall
be
faithfully
obeyed
replied
bouchier
bound
hand
and
foot
fenwolf
was
thrown
upon
the
back
of
a
horse
and
guarded
by
two
halberdiers
who
were
prepared
to
strike
him
dead
on
the
slightest
movement
in
this
way
he
was
conveyed
to
the
castle
and
placed
in
the
of
the
lower
gate
till
further
orders
should
be
issued
respecting
him
ix
showing
how
morgan
fenwolf
escaped
from
the
garter
tower
afterwards
fenwolf
was
visited
by
the
duke
of
suffolk
and
a
canon
of
the
college
and
the
being
cleared
the
duke
enjoined
him
to
make
clear
his
bosom
by
confession
i
hold
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
prisoner
said
suffolk
that
there
is
no
hope
of
your
life
the
king
highness
is
determined
to
make
a
fearful
example
of
you
and
all
your
companions
in
crime
but
he
does
not
seek
to
destroy
your
soul
and
has
therefore
sent
this
holy
man
to
you
with
the
desire
that
you
may
open
your
heart
to
him
and
by
confession
and
repentance
save
yourself
from
eternal
confession
will
profit
me
nothing
said
fenwolf
moodily
i
can
not
pray
if
i
you
can
not
be
so
utterly
lost
my
son
rejoined
the
canon
hell
may
have
woven
her
dark
chains
round
you
but
not
so
firmly
but
that
the
hand
of
heaven
can
burst
you
waste
time
in
seeking
to
persuade
me
returned
fenwolf
you
are
not
ignorant
of
the
punishment
inflicted
upon
those
condemned
for
sorcery
my
son
demanded
the
canon
it
is
the
stake
is
it
not
replied
fenwolf
ay
replied
the
canon
but
even
that
fiery
trial
will
fail
to
purge
out
your
offences
without
penitence
my
lord
of
suffolk
this
wretched
man
condition
demands
special
attention
it
will
profit
the
church
much
to
win
his
soul
from
the
fiend
let
him
i
pray
you
be
removed
to
the
dungeon
beneath
the
garter
tower
where
a
priest
shall
visit
him
and
pray
by
his
side
till
it
will
be
useless
father
said
fenwolf
i
do
not
despair
my
son
replied
the
canon
and
when
i
see
you
again
in
the
morning
i
trust
to
find
you
in
a
better
frame
of
the
duke
then
gave
directions
to
the
guard
to
remove
the
prisoner
and
after
some
further
conference
with
the
canon
returned
to
the
royal
apartments
meanwhile
the
canon
shaped
his
course
towards
the
horseshoe
cloisters
a
range
of
buildings
so
designated
from
their
form
and
situated
at
the
west
end
of
george
chapel
and
he
had
scarcely
entered
them
when
he
heard
footsteps
behind
him
and
turning
at
the
sound
beheld
a
franciscan
friar
for
so
his
habit
of
the
coarsest
grey
cloth
tied
with
a
cord
round
the
waist
proclaimed
him
the
friar
was
very
tall
and
gaunt
and
his
cowl
was
drawn
over
his
face
so
as
to
conceal
his
features
what
would
you
brother
inquired
the
canon
halting
i
have
a
request
to
make
of
you
reverend
sir
replied
the
friar
with
a
lowly
inclination
of
the
head
i
have
just
arrived
from
chertsey
abbey
whither
i
have
been
tarrying
for
the
last
three
days
and
while
conversing
with
the
guard
at
the
gate
i
saw
a
prisoner
brought
into
the
castle
charged
with
heinous
offences
and
amongst
others
with
dealings
with
the
you
have
been
rightly
informed
brother
rejoined
the
canon
and
have
i
also
been
rightly
informed
that
you
desire
a
priest
to
pass
the
night
with
him
reverend
sir
returned
the
friar
if
so
i
would
crave
permission
to
undertake
the
office
two
souls
as
deeply
laden
as
that
of
this
poor
wretch
have
been
snatched
from
the
jaws
of
satan
by
my
efforts
and
i
do
not
despair
of
success
since
you
are
so
confident
brother
said
the
canon
i
commit
him
readily
to
your
hands
i
was
about
to
seek
other
aid
but
your
offer
comes
opportunely
with
heaven
help
i
doubt
not
you
will
achieve
a
victory
over
the
evil
as
the
latter
words
were
uttered
a
sudden
pain
seemed
to
seize
the
friar
staggering
slightly
he
caught
at
the
railing
of
the
cloisters
for
support
but
he
instantly
recovered
himself
it
is
nothing
reverend
sir
he
said
seeing
that
the
good
canon
regarded
him
anxiously
long
vigils
and
fasting
have
made
me
liable
to
frequent
attacks
of
giddiness
but
they
pass
as
quickly
as
they
come
will
it
please
you
to
go
with
me
and
direct
the
guard
to
admit
me
to
the
prisoner
the
canon
assented
and
crossing
the
quadrangle
they
returned
to
the
gateway
meanwhile
the
prisoner
had
been
removed
to
the
lower
chamber
of
the
garter
tower
this
fortification
one
of
the
oldest
in
the
castle
being
coeval
with
the
curfew
tower
is
now
in
a
state
of
grievous
neglect
and
ruin
unroofed
unfloored
filled
with
rubbish
masked
by
the
yard
walls
of
the
adjoining
habitations
with
one
side
entirely
pulled
down
and
a
great
breach
in
front
it
is
solely
owing
to
the
solid
and
construction
of
its
masonry
that
it
is
indebted
for
partial
preservation
still
notwithstanding
its
dilapidated
condition
and
that
it
is
the
mere
shell
of
its
former
self
its
appearance
is
highly
picturesque
the
walls
are
of
prodigious
thickness
and
the
deep
embrasures
within
them
are
almost
perfect
while
a
secret
staircase
may
still
be
tracked
partly
round
the
building
amid
the
rubbish
choking
up
its
lower
chamber
grows
a
young
tree
green
and
type
it
is
to
be
hoped
of
the
restoration
of
the
structure
conducted
to
a
low
vaulted
chamber
in
this
tower
the
prisoner
was
cast
upon
its
he
was
still
hound
hand
and
left
alone
and
in
darkness
but
he
was
not
destined
to
continue
in
this
state
long
the
door
of
the
dungeon
opened
and
the
guard
ushered
in
the
tall
franciscan
friar
what
ho
dog
of
a
prisoner
he
cried
here
is
a
holy
man
come
to
pass
the
night
with
you
in
he
may
take
his
ave
maries
and
paternosters
want
them
not
replied
fenwolf
moodily
you
would
prefer
my
bringing
herne
the
hunter
no
doubt
rejoined
the
guard
laughing
at
his
own
jest
but
this
is
a
physician
for
your
soul
the
saints
help
you
in
your
good
work
father
you
will
have
no
easy
set
down
the
light
my
son
cried
the
friar
harshly
and
leave
us
my
task
will
be
easily
placing
the
lamp
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
dungeon
the
guard
withdrew
and
locked
the
door
after
him
do
you
repent
my
son
demanded
the
friar
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
certes
i
repent
having
put
faith
in
a
treacherous
fiend
who
has
deserted
that
is
all
replied
fenwolf
with
his
face
turned
to
the
ground
will
you
put
faith
in
me
if
i
promise
you
deliverance
demanded
the
friar
you
promise
more
than
you
can
perform
as
most
of
your
brethren
do
rejoined
the
other
you
will
not
say
so
if
you
look
up
said
the
friar
fenwolf
started
at
the
words
which
were
pronounced
in
a
different
tone
from
that
previously
adopted
by
the
speaker
and
raised
himself
as
far
as
his
bonds
would
permit
him
the
friar
had
thrown
hack
his
cowl
and
disclosed
features
of
appalling
hideousness
lighted
up
by
a
diabolical
grin
you
here
cried
fenwolf
you
doubted
me
rejoined
herne
but
i
never
desert
a
follower
besides
i
wish
to
show
the
royal
harry
that
my
power
is
equal
to
his
but
how
are
we
to
get
out
of
this
dungeon
asked
fenwolf
gazing
round
apprehensively
my
way
out
will
be
easy
enough
replied
herne
but
your
escape
is
attended
with
more
difficulty
you
remember
how
we
went
to
the
vaulted
chamber
in
the
curfew
tower
on
the
night
when
mark
fytton
the
butcher
was
confined
within
it
i
do
replied
fenwolf
but
i
can
think
of
nothing
while
i
am
tied
heme
instantly
drew
forth
a
and
cutting
fenwolf
bonds
asunder
the
latter
started
to
his
feet
if
that
butcher
would
have
joined
me
i
would
have
liberated
him
as
i
am
about
to
liberate
you
pursued
herne
but
to
return
to
the
matter
in
hand
you
recollect
the
secret
passage
we
then
tracked
there
is
just
such
another
staircase
in
this
and
stepping
to
the
farther
side
of
the
chamber
he
touched
a
small
knob
in
the
wall
and
a
stone
flew
hack
disclosing
an
aperture
just
large
enough
to
allow
a
man
to
pass
through
it
there
is
your
road
to
freedom
he
said
pointing
to
the
hole
creep
along
that
narrow
passage
and
it
will
bring
you
to
a
small
loophole
in
the
wall
not
many
feet
from
the
ground
the
loophole
is
guarded
by
a
bar
of
iron
but
it
is
moved
by
a
spring
in
the
upper
part
of
the
stone
in
which
it
appears
to
be
mortised
this
impediment
removed
you
will
easily
force
your
way
through
the
loophole
drop
cautiously
for
fear
of
the
sentinels
on
the
walls
then
make
your
way
to
the
forest
and
if
you
the
arquebusiers
who
are
scouring
it
conceal
yourself
in
the
sandstone
cave
below
the
and
what
of
you
asked
fenwoif
i
have
more
to
do
here
replied
herne
away
thus
dismissed
fenwolf
entered
the
aperture
which
was
instantly
closed
after
him
by
herne
carefully
following
the
instructions
of
his
leader
the
keeper
passed
through
the
loophole
let
himself
drop
softly
down
and
keeping
close
to
the
walls
of
the
tower
till
he
heard
the
sentinels
move
off
darted
swiftly
across
the
street
and
made
good
his
escape
meanwhile
herne
drew
the
cowl
over
his
head
and
stepping
to
the
door
knocked
loudly
against
it
what
would
you
father
cried
the
guard
from
without
enter
my
son
and
you
shall
know
replied
herne
the
next
moment
the
door
was
unlocked
and
the
guard
advanced
into
the
dungeon
ha
he
exclaimed
snatching
up
the
lamp
and
looking
around
where
is
the
prisoner
gone
replied
herne
what
has
the
fiend
flown
away
with
him
cried
the
man
in
mixed
astonishment
and
alarm
he
has
been
set
free
by
herne
the
hunter
cried
the
demon
tell
all
who
question
thee
so
and
relate
what
thou
now
at
the
words
a
bright
blue
flame
illumined
the
chamber
in
the
midst
of
which
was
seen
the
tall
dark
figure
of
herne
his
franciscan
gown
had
dropped
to
his
feet
and
he
appeared
habited
in
his
wild
garb
with
a
loud
cry
the
guard
fell
senseless
on
the
ground
a
few
minutes
after
this
as
was
subsequently
ascertained
a
tall
franciscan
friar
threaded
the
cloisters
behind
saint
george
chapel
and
giving
the
word
to
the
sentinels
passed
through
the
outer
door
communicating
with
the
steep
descent
leading
to
the
town
x
how
herne
the
hunter
was
himself
hunted
on
the
guard
recovery
information
of
what
had
occurred
was
immediately
conveyed
to
the
king
who
had
not
yet
retired
to
rest
but
was
sitting
in
his
private
chamber
with
the
dukes
of
suffolk
and
norfolk
the
intelligence
threw
him
into
a
great
fury
he
buffeted
the
guard
and
ordered
him
to
be
locked
up
in
the
dungeon
whence
the
prisoner
had
escaped
reprimanded
the
canon
directed
the
duke
of
suffolk
with
a
patrol
to
make
search
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
castle
for
the
fugitive
and
the
friar
and
bade
the
duke
of
norfolk
get
together
a
band
of
arquebusiers
and
as
soon
as
the
latter
were
assembled
he
put
himself
at
their
head
and
again
rode
into
the
forest
the
cavalcade
had
proceeded
about
a
mile
along
the
great
avenue
when
one
of
the
arquebusiers
rode
up
and
said
that
he
heard
some
distant
sounds
on
the
right
commanding
a
halt
henry
listened
for
a
moment
and
satisfied
that
the
man
was
right
quitted
the
course
he
was
pursuing
and
dashed
across
the
broad
glade
now
traversed
by
the
avenue
called
queen
anne
ride
as
he
advanced
the
rapid
trampling
of
horses
was
heard
accompanied
by
shouts
and
presently
afterwards
a
troop
of
horsemen
in
fantastic
garbs
was
seen
galloping
down
the
hill
pursued
by
bouchier
and
his
followers
the
king
immediately
shaped
his
course
so
as
to
intercept
the
flying
party
and
being
in
some
measure
screened
by
the
trees
he
burst
unexpectedly
upon
them
at
a
turn
of
the
road
henry
called
to
the
fugitives
to
surrender
but
they
refused
and
brandishing
their
long
knives
and
spears
made
a
desperate
resistance
but
they
were
speedily
surrounded
and
overpowered
bouchier
inquired
from
the
king
what
should
be
done
with
the
prisoners
hang
them
all
upon
yon
trees
cried
henry
pointing
to
two
sister
oaks
which
stood
near
the
scene
of
strife
the
terrible
sentence
was
immediately
carried
into
execution
cords
were
produced
and
in
less
than
twenty
breathless
bodies
were
swinging
from
the
branches
of
the
two
trees
indicated
by
the
king
this
will
serve
to
deter
others
from
like
offences
observed
henry
who
had
watched
the
whole
proceedings
with
savage
satisfaction
and
now
bouchier
how
came
you
to
let
the
leader
of
these
villains
escape
i
did
not
know
he
had
escaped
my
liege
replied
bouchier
in
astonishment
yea
marry
but
he
has
escaped
rejoined
henry
and
he
has
had
the
audacity
to
show
himself
in
the
castle
within
this
hour
and
the
cunning
moreover
to
set
the
prisoner
and
he
proceeded
to
relate
what
had
occurred
this
is
strange
indeed
my
liege
replied
bouchier
at
the
close
of
the
king
recital
and
to
my
thinking
is
proof
convincing
that
we
have
to
do
with
a
supernatural
supernatura
pshaw
banish
the
idle
notion
rejoined
henry
sternly
we
are
all
the
dupes
of
some
jugglery
the
caitiff
will
doubtless
return
to
the
forest
continue
your
search
therefore
for
him
throughout
the
night
if
you
catch
him
i
promise
you
a
royal
so
saying
he
rode
back
to
the
castle
somewhat
appeased
by
the
wholesale
vengeance
he
had
taken
upon
the
offenders
in
obedience
to
the
orders
he
had
received
bouchier
with
his
followers
continued
riding
about
the
forest
during
the
whole
night
but
without
finding
anything
to
reward
his
search
until
about
dawn
it
occurred
to
him
to
return
to
the
trees
on
which
the
bodies
were
suspended
as
he
approached
them
he
fancied
he
beheld
a
horse
standing
beneath
the
nearest
tree
and
immediately
ordered
his
followers
to
proceed
as
noiselessly
as
possible
and
to
keep
under
the
cover
of
the
wood
a
nearer
advance
convinced
him
that
his
eyes
had
not
deceived
him
it
was
a
swart
horse
that
he
beheld
with
eyes
that
flamed
like
carbuncles
while
a
couple
of
bodies
evidently
snatched
from
the
branches
were
laid
across
his
back
a
glance
at
the
trees
too
showed
bouchier
that
they
had
been
considerably
lightened
of
their
hideous
spoil
seeing
this
bouchier
dashed
forward
alarmed
by
the
noise
the
wild
horse
neighed
loudly
and
a
dark
figure
instantly
dropped
from
the
tree
upon
its
back
and
proceeded
to
disencumber
it
of
its
load
but
before
this
could
be
accomplished
a
bolt
from
a
shot
by
one
of
bouchier
followers
pierced
the
animal
brain
rearing
aloft
it
fell
backwards
in
such
manner
as
would
have
crushed
an
ordinary
rider
but
herne
slipped
off
uninjured
and
with
incredible
swiftness
darted
among
the
trees
the
others
started
in
pursuit
and
a
chase
commenced
in
which
the
demon
huntsman
had
to
sustain
the
part
of
the
deer
nor
could
any
deer
have
afforded
better
sport
away
flew
the
pursued
and
pursuers
over
broad
glade
and
through
tangled
glen
the
woods
resounding
with
their
cries
bouchier
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
fugitive
for
a
moment
and
urged
his
men
to
push
on
but
despite
his
alternate
proffers
and
menaces
they
gained
but
little
on
herne
who
speeding
towards
the
home
park
cleared
its
high
palings
with
a
single
bound
over
went
bouchier
and
his
followers
and
they
then
descried
him
making
his
way
to
a
large
oak
standing
almost
alone
in
the
centre
of
a
wide
glade
an
instant
afterwards
he
reached
the
tree
shook
his
arm
menacingly
at
his
pursuers
and
vanished
the
next
moment
bouchier
came
up
flung
himself
from
his
panting
steed
and
with
his
drawn
sword
in
hand
forced
himself
through
a
rift
in
its
side
into
the
tree
there
was
a
hollow
within
it
large
enough
to
allow
a
man
to
stand
upright
and
two
holes
ran
upwards
into
the
branches
finding
nothing
bouchier
called
for
a
and
thrust
it
as
far
as
he
could
into
the
holes
above
the
point
encountered
no
obstruction
except
such
as
was
offered
by
the
wood
itself
he
stamped
upon
the
ground
and
sounded
it
on
all
sides
with
the
spear
but
with
no
better
success
issuing
forth
he
next
directed
his
attention
to
the
upper
part
of
the
tree
which
while
he
was
occupied
inside
had
been
very
carefully
watched
by
his
followers
and
not
content
with
viewing
it
from
below
he
clambered
into
the
branches
but
they
had
nothing
to
show
except
their
own
leafy
covering
the
careful
examination
of
the
ground
about
the
tree
at
length
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
small
hole
among
its
roots
about
half
a
dozen
yards
from
the
trunk
and
though
this
hole
seemed
scarcely
large
enough
to
serve
for
an
entrance
to
the
burrow
of
a
fox
bouchier
deemed
it
expedient
to
keep
a
careful
watch
over
it
his
investigation
completed
he
dispatched
a
sergeant
of
the
guard
to
the
castle
to
acquaint
the
king
with
what
had
occurred
disturbed
by
the
events
of
the
night
henry
obtained
little
sleep
and
at
an
early
hour
summoned
an
attendant
and
demanded
whether
there
were
any
tidings
from
the
forest
the
attendant
replied
that
a
sergeant
of
the
guard
was
without
sent
by
captain
bouchier
with
a
message
for
his
majesty
the
sergeant
was
immediately
admitted
to
the
royal
presence
and
on
the
close
of
his
marvellous
story
the
king
who
had
worked
himself
into
a
tremendous
fury
during
its
relation
roared
out
what
foiled
again
ha
but
he
shall
not
escape
if
i
have
to
root
up
half
the
trees
in
the
forest
bouchier
and
his
fellows
must
be
bewitched
harkye
knaves
get
together
a
dozen
of
the
best
woodmen
and
yeomen
in
the
castle
instantly
as
you
value
your
lives
bid
them
bring
axe
and
saw
pick
and
spade
d
mark
me
ha
stay
i
have
not
done
i
must
have
fagots
and
straw
for
i
will
burn
this
tree
to
the
ground
burn
it
to
a
char
summon
the
dukes
of
suffolk
and
norfolk
the
rascal
archer
i
dubbed
the
duke
of
shoreditch
and
his
mates
the
keepers
of
the
forest
and
their
hounds
summon
them
quickly
and
bid
a
band
of
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
get
and
he
sprang
from
his
couch
the
king
commands
were
executed
with
such
alacrity
that
by
the
time
he
was
fully
attired
the
whole
of
the
persons
he
had
ordered
to
be
summoned
were
assembled
putting
himself
at
their
head
he
rode
forth
to
the
home
park
and
found
bouchier
and
his
followers
grouped
around
the
tree
we
are
still
at
fault
my
liege
said
bouchier
so
i
see
sir
replied
the
king
angrily
hew
down
the
tree
instantly
knaves
he
added
to
the
woodmen
fall
to
fall
ropes
were
then
fastened
to
the
head
of
the
tree
and
the
welkin
resounded
with
the
rapid
strokes
of
the
hatchets
it
was
a
task
of
some
difficulty
but
such
zeal
and
energy
were
displayed
by
the
woodmen
that
ere
long
the
giant
trunk
lay
prostrate
on
the
ground
its
hollows
were
now
fully
exposed
to
view
but
they
were
empty
set
fire
to
the
accursed
piece
of
timber
roared
the
king
and
burn
it
to
dust
and
scatter
it
to
the
wind
at
these
orders
two
yeomen
of
the
guard
advanced
and
throwing
down
a
heap
of
fagots
straw
and
other
combustibles
on
the
roots
of
the
tree
soon
kindled
a
fierce
fire
meanwhile
a
couple
of
woodmen
stripped
of
their
jerkins
and
with
their
brawny
arms
bared
to
the
shoulder
mounted
on
the
trunk
and
strove
to
split
it
asunder
some
of
the
keepers
likewise
got
into
the
branches
and
peered
into
every
crack
and
crevice
in
the
hope
of
making
some
discovery
amongst
the
latter
was
will
sommers
who
had
posted
himself
near
a
great
arm
of
the
tree
which
he
maintained
when
lopped
off
would
be
found
to
contain
the
demon
nor
were
other
expedients
neglected
a
fierce
hound
had
been
sent
into
the
hole
near
the
roots
of
the
tree
by
gabriel
lapp
but
after
a
short
absence
he
returned
howling
and
terrified
nor
could
all
the
efforts
of
gabriel
seconded
by
a
severe
scourging
with
his
heavy
induce
him
to
enter
it
again
when
the
hound
had
come
forth
a
couple
of
yeomen
advanced
to
enlarge
the
opening
while
a
third
with
a
pick
endeavoured
to
remove
the
root
which
formed
an
impediment
to
their
efforts
they
may
dig
but
they
never
catch
him
observed

roaring

howling

with

without
heeding

ran
off

though

ere

the
general
opinion
that
it

useless
to

further
in

the
king

his
characteristic
obstinacy
would
not
give
it
up

time
the
whole
of
the

of
the
enormous

was
consumed
and
its
branches
cast
into

the

were
rent
from

and
a
wide
and
deep
trench
digged
around
the
spot
the
course
of
the
hole
was
traced
for
some
distance
but
it
was
never

was
suddenly
lost
by
the
falling

of
the
earth
at
length
after
five
hours
close
watching

exhausted

he
ordered

thus
ends
the
second
book
of
the
chronicle
of
windsor
castle
book
iii
the
history
of
the
castle
i
comprising
the
first
two
epochs
in
the
history
of
windsor
castle
amid
the
gloom
hovering
over
the
early
history
of
windsor
castle
appear
the
mighty
phantoms
of
the
renowned
king
arthur
and
his
knights
for
whom
it
is
said
merlin
reared
a
magic
fortress
upon
its
heights
in
a
great
hall
whereof
decorated
with
trophies
of
war
and
of
the
chase
was
placed
the
famous
round
table
but
if
the
antique
tale
is
now
worn
out
and
no
longer
part
of
our
faith
it
is
pleasant
at
least
to
record
it
and
surrendering
ourselves
for
a
while
to
the
sway
of
fancy
to
conjure
up
the
old
enchanted
castle
on
the
hill
to
people
its
courts
with
warlike
and
lovely
forms
its
forests
with
fays
and
giants
windsor
or
wyndleshore
so
called
from
the
winding
banks
of
the
river
flowing
past
it
was
the
abode
of
the
ancient
saxon
monarchs
and
a
legend
is
related
by
william
of
malmesbury
of
a
woodman
named
wulwin
who
being
stricken
with
blindness
and
having
visited
churches
and
vainly
implored
their
tutelary
saints
for
relief
was
at
last
restored
to
sight
by
the
touch
of
edward
the
confessor
who
further
enhanced
the
boon
by
making
him
keeper
of
his
palace
at
windsor
but
though
this
story
may
be
doubted
it
is
certain
that
the
pious
king
above
mentioned
granted
windsor
to
the
abbot
and
monks
of
saint
peter
at
westminster
for
the
hope
of
eternal
reward
the
remission
of
his
sins
the
sins
of
his
father
mother
and
all
his
ancestors
and
to
the
praise
of
almighty
god
as
a
perpetual
endowment
and
but
the
royal
donation
did
not
long
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
priesthood
struck
by
the
extreme
beauty
of
the
spot
for
that
it
seemed
exceeding
profitable
and
commodious
because
situate
so
near
the
thames
the
wood
fit
for
game
and
many
other
particulars
lying
there
meet
and
necessary
for
kings
yea
a
place
very
convenient
for
his
reception
william
the
conqueror
prevailed
upon
abbot
edwin
to
accept
in
exchange
for
it
wakendune
and
feringes
in
essex
together
with
three
other
tenements
in
colchester
and
having
obtained
possession
of
the
coveted
hill
he
forthwith
began
to
erect
a
castle
upon
it
occupying
a
space
of
about
half
a
hide
of
land
around
it
he
formed
large
parks
to
enable
him
to
pursue
his
favourite
pastime
of
hunting
and
he
enacted
and
enforced
severe
laws
for
the
preservation
of
the
game
as
devoted
to
the
chase
as
his
father
william
rufus
frequently
hunted
in
the
forests
of
windsor
and
solemnised
some
of
the
festivals
of
the
church
in
the
castle
in
the
succeeding
reign
namely
that
of
henry
the
first
the
castle
was
entirely
rebuilt
and
greatly
enlarged
assuming
somewhat
of
the
character
of
a
palatial
residence
having
before
been
little
more
than
a
strong
the
structure
then
erected
in
all
probability
occupied
the
same
site
as
the
upper
and
lower
wards
of
the
present
pile
but
nothing
remains
of
it
except
perhaps
the
keep
and
of
that
little
beyond
its
form
and
position
in
henry
celebrated
the
feast
of
pentecost
with
great
state
and
magnificence
within
the
castle
in
he
there
espoused
his
second
wife
adelicia
daughter
of
godfrey
duke
of
louvain
and
failing
in
obtaining
issue
by
her
assembled
the
barons
at
windsor
and
causing
them
together
with
david
king
of
scotland
his
sister
adela
and
her
son
stephen
afterwards
king
of
england
to
do
homage
to
his
daughter
maud
widow
of
the
emperor
henry
the
fifth
proof
that
windsor
castle
was
regarded
as
the
second
fortress
in
the
realm
is
afforded
by
the
treaty
of
peace
between
the
usurper
stephen
and
the
empress
maud
in
which
it
is
coupled
with
the
tower
of
london
under
the
designation
of
mota
de
windsor
at
the
signing
of
the
treaty
it
was
committed
to
the
custody
of
richard
de
lucy
who
was
continued
in
the
office
of
keeper
by
henry
the
second
in
the
reign
of
this
monarch
many
repairs
were
made
in
the
castle
to
which
a
vineyard
was
attached
the
cultivation
of
the
grape
being
at
this
time
extensively
practised
throughout
england
strange
as
the
circumstance
may
now
appear
stow
mentions
that
vines
grew
in
abundance
in
the
home
park
in
the
reign
of
richard
the
second
the
wine
made
from
them
being
consumed
at
the
king
table
and
even
sold
it
is
related
by
fabian
that
henry
stung
by
the
disobedience
and
ingratitude
of
his
sons
caused
an
allegorical
picture
to
be
painted
representing
an
old
eagle
assailed
by
four
young
ones
which
he
placed
in
one
of
the
chambers
of
the
castle
when
asked
the
meaning
of
the
device
he
replied
i
am
the
old
eagle
and
the
four
eaglets
are
my
sons
who
cease
not
to
pursue
my
death
the
youngest
bird
who
is
tearing
out
its
parent
eyes
is
my
son
john
my
youngest
and
son
and
who
yet
is
the
most
eager
for
my
on
his
departure
for
the
holy
wars
richard
coeur
de
lion
entrusted
the
government
of
the
castle
to
hugh
de
pudsey
bishop
of
durham
and
earl
of
northumberland
but
a
fierce
dispute
arising
between
the
and
his
ambitious
colleague
william
longchamp
bishop
of
ely
he
was
seized
and
imprisoned
by
the
latter
and
compelled
to
surrender
the
castle
after
an
extraordinary
display
of
ostentation
longchamp
was
ousted
in
his
turn
on
the
arrival
of
the
news
of
richard
capture
and
imprisonment
in
austria
the
castle
was
seized
by
prince
john
but
it
was
soon
afterwards
taken
possession
of
in
the
king
behalf
by
the
barons
and
consigned
to
the
custody
of
eleanor
the
in
john
reign
the
castle
became
the
scene
of
a
foul
and
terrible
event
william
de
braose
a
powerful
baron
having
offended
the
king
his
wife
maud
was
ordered
to
deliver
up
her
son
a
hostage
for
her
husband
but
instead
of
complying
with
the
injunction
she
rashly
returned
for
answer
that
she
would
not
entrust
her
child
to
the
person
who
could
slay
his
own
upon
which
the
ruthless
king
seized
her
and
her
son
and
enclosing
them
in
a
recess
in
the
wall
of
the
castle
built
them
up
within
it
sorely
pressed
by
the
barons
in
john
sought
refuge
within
the
castle
and
in
the
same
year
signed
the
two
charters
magna
charta
and
charta
de
foresta
at
runnymede
a
plain
between
windsor
and
staines
a
curious
account
of
his
frantic
demeanour
after
divesting
himself
of
so
much
power
and
extending
so
greatly
the
liberties
of
the
subject
is
given
by
holinshed
having
acted
so
far
contrary
to
his
mind
the
king
was
right
sorrowful
in
heart
cursed
his
mother
that
bare
him
and
the
hour
in
which
he
was
born
wishing
that
he
had
received
death
by
violence
of
sword
or
knife
instead
of
natural
nourishment
he
whetted
his
teeth
and
did
bite
now
on
one
staff
now
on
another
as
he
walked
and
oft
brake
the
same
in
pieces
when
he
had
done
and
with
such
disordered
behaviour
and
furious
gestures
he
uttered
his
grief
that
the
noblemen
very
well
perceived
the
inclination
of
his
inward
affection
concerning
these
things
before
the
of
the
council
and
therefore
sore
lamented
the
state
of
the
realm
guessing
what
would
follow
of
his
impatience
and
displeasant
taking
of
the
the
faithless
king
made
an
attempt
to
regain
his
lost
power
and
war
breaking
out
afresh
in
the
following
year
a
numerous
army
under
the
command
of
william
de
nivernois
besieged
the
castle
which
was
stoutly
defended
by
inglehard
de
achie
and
sixty
knights
the
barons
however
learning
that
john
was
marching
through
norfolk
and
suffolk
and
ravaging
the
country
hastily
raised
the
siege
and
advanced
to
meet
him
but
he
avoided
them
marched
to
stamford
and
lincoln
and
from
thence
towards
wales
on
his
return
from
this
expedition
he
was
seized
with
the
distemper
of
which
he
died
henry
the
third
was
an
ardent
encourager
of
architecture
and
his
reign
marks
the
second
great
epoch
in
the
annals
of
the
castle
in
eight
hundred
marks
were
paid
to
engelhard
de
cygony
constable
of
the
castle
john
le
draper
and
william
the
clerk
of
windsor
masters
of
the
works
and
others
for
repairs
and
works
within
the
castle
the
latter
it
is
conjectured
referring
to
the
erection
of
a
new
great
hall
within
the
lower
ward
there
being
already
a
hall
of
small
dimensions
in
the
upper
court
the
windows
of
the
new
building
were
filled
with
painted
glass
and
at
the
upper
end
upon
a
raised
dais
was
a
gilt
throne
sustaining
a
statue
of
the
king
in
his
robes
within
this
vast
and
richly
decorated
chamber
in
on
the
day
of
the
nativity
an
infinite
number
of
poor
persons
were
collected
and
fed
by
the
king
command
during
the
greater
part
of
henry
long
and
eventful
reign
the
works
within
the
castle
proceeded
with
unabated
activity
carpenters
were
maintained
on
the
royal
establishment
the
ditch
between
the
hall
and
the
lower
ward
was
repaired
a
new
kitchen
was
built
the
bridges
were
repaired
with
timber
procured
from
the
neighbouring
forests
certain
breaches
in
the
wall
facing
the
garden
were
stopped
the
fortifications
were
surveyed
and
the
battlements
repaired
at
the
same
time
the
queen
chamber
was
painted
and
wainscoted
and
iron
bars
were
placed
before
the
windows
of
prince
edward
chamber
in
henry
commenced
building
an
apartment
for
his
own
use
near
the
wall
of
the
castle
sixty
feet
long
and
high
another
apartment
for
the
queen
contiguous
to
it
and
a
chapel
seventy
feet
long
and
feet
wide
along
the
same
wall
but
with
a
grassy
space
between
it
and
the
royal
apartments
the
chapel
as
appears
from
an
order
to
walter
de
grey
archbishop
of
york
had
a
galilee
and
a
cloister
a
lofty
wooden
roof
covered
with
lead
and
a
stone
turret
in
front
holding
three
or
four
bells
withinside
it
was
made
to
appear
like
with
good
ceiling
and
painting
and
it
contained
four
gilded
images
this
structure
is
supposed
to
have
been
in
existence
under
the
designation
of
the
old
college
church
in
the
latter
part
of
the
reign
of
henry
the
seventh
by
whom
it
was
pulled
down
to
make
way
for
the
traces
of
its
architecture
have
been
discovered
by
diligent
antiquarian
research
in
the
south
ambulatory
of
the
dean
cloister
and
in
the
door
behind
the
altar
in
george
chapel
the
latter
of
which
is
conceived
to
have
formed
the
principal
entrance
to
the
older
structure
and
has
been
described
as
exhibiting
one
of
the
most
beautiful
specimens
which
time
and
innovation
have
respected
of
the
elaborate
ornamental
work
of
the
in
henry
commenced
operations
upon
the
outworks
of
the
castle
and
the
three
towers
on
the
western
side
of
the
lower
ward
now
known
as
the
curfew
the
garter
and
the
salisbury
towers
were
erected
by
him
he
also
continued
the
walls
along
the
south
side
of
the
lower
ward
traces
of
the
architecture
of
the
period
being
discoverable
in
the
inner
walls
of
the
houses
of
the
as
far
as
the
tower
now
bearing
his
name
from
thence
it
is
concluded
that
the
ramparts
ran
along
the
east
side
of
the
upper
ward
to
a
tower
occupying
the
site
of
the
wykeham
or
winchester
tower
the
three
towers
at
the
west
end
of
the
lower
ward
though
much
dilapidated
present
unquestionable
features
of
the
architecture
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
lower
storey
of
the
curfew
tower
which
has
been
but
little
altered
consists
of
a
large
vaulted
chamber
feet
wide
with
walls
of
nearly
thirteen
feet
in
thickness
and
having
arched
recesses
terminated
by
loopholes
the
walls
are
covered
with
the
inscriptions
of
prisoners
who
have
been
confined
within
it
the
garter
tower
though
in
a
most
ruinous
condition
exhibits
high
architectural
beauty
in
its
moulded
arches
and
corbelled
passages
the
salisbury
tower
retains
only
externally
and
on
the
side
towards
the
town
its
original
aspect
the
remains
of
a
fourth
tower
are
discernible
in
the
governor
of
the
tower
and
henry
the
third
tower
as
before
observed
completes
what
remains
of
the
original
chain
of
fortifications
on
the
of
november
henry
issued
a
writ
enjoining
the
clerks
of
the
works
at
windsor
to
work
day
and
night
to
wainscot
the
high
chamber
upon
the
wall
of
the
castle
near
our
chapel
in
the
upper
bailey
so
that
it
may
be
ready
and
properly
wainscoted
on
friday
next
the
occurring
on
a
tuesday
only
two
days
were
allowed
for
the
task
when
we
come
there
with
boards
radiated
and
coloured
so
that
nothing
be
found
reprehensible
in
that
wainscot
and
also
to
make
at
each
gable
of
the
said
chamber
one
glass
window
on
the
outside
of
the
inner
window
of
each
gable
so
that
when
the
inner
window
shall
be
closed
the
glass
windows
may
be
seen
the
following
year
the
works
were
suspended
but
they
were
afterwards
resumed
and
continued
with
few
interruptions
the
keep
was
new
constructed
a
stone
bench
was
fixed
in
the
wall
near
the
by
the
king
chamber
a
bridge
was
thrown
across
the
ditch
to
the
garden
which
lay
outside
the
walls
a
barbican
was
erected
to
which
a
portcullis
was
subsequently
attached
the
bridges
were
defended
by
strong
iron
chains
the
old
chambers
in
the
upper
ward
were
renovated
a
conduit
and
lavatory
were
added
and
a
fountain
was
constructed
in
the
garden
in
this
reign
in
all
probability
the
norman
tower
which
now
forms
a
gateway
between
the
middle
and
the
upper
ward
was
erected
this

heavy
fine
imposed
upon

adherence
to

who
had
been
just
before
slain
at

battle
of

during

a
terrific
storm
of

and
thunder
occurred
which
tore
up

great
trees
in

park
shook
the

blew
down
a
part
of

were
lodged
but
happily
without
doing
them
injury
four
of
the
children
of
edward
the
first
who
was
blessed
with
a
numerous
offspring
were
born
at
windsor
and
as
he
frequently
resided
at
the
castle
the
town
began
to
increase
in
importance
and
consideration
by
a
charter
granted
in
it
was
created
a
free
borough
and
various
privileges
were
conferred
on
its
inhabitants
stow
tells
us
that
in
on
the
last
day
of
february
there
suddenly
arose
such
a
fire
in
the
castle
of
windsor
that
many
offices
were
therewith
consumed
and
many
goodly
images
made
to
beautify
the
buildings
defaced
and
deformed
edward
the
second
and
his
beautiful
but
perfidious
queen
isabella
of
france
made
windsor
castle
their
frequent
abode
and
here
on
the
day
of
november
at
forty
minutes
past
five
in
the
morning
was
born
a
prince
over
whose
nativity
the
wizard
merlin
must
have
presided
baptized
within
the
old
chapel
by
the
name
of
edward
this
prince
became
afterwards
the
third
monarch
of
the
name
and
the
greatest
and
was
also
styled
from
the
place
of
his
birth
edward
of
windsor
ii
comprising
the
third
great
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
castle
and
showing
how
the
most
noble
order
of
the
garter
was
instituted
strongly
attached
to
the
place
of
his
birth
edward
the
third
by
his
letters
patent
dated
from
westminster
in
the
year
of
his
reign
now
founded
the
ancient
chapel
established
by
henry
the
first
and
dedicated
it
to
the
virgin
saint
george
of
cappadocia
and
saint
edward
the
confessor
ordaining
that
to
the
eight
canons
appointed
by
his
predecessor
there
should
be
added
one
custos
fifteen
more
canons
and
the
whole
to
be
maintained
out
of
the
revenues
with
which
the
chapel
was
to
be
endowed
the
institution
was
confirmed
by
pope
clement
the
sixth
by
a
bull
issued
at
avignon
the
of
november
in
before
the
foundation
of
the
college
had
been
confirmed
as
above
related
edward
instituted
the
order
of
the
garter
the
origin
of
this
illustrious
order
has
been
much
disputed
by
some
writers
it
has
been
ascribed
to
richard
coeur
de
lion
who
is
said
to
have
girded
a
leathern
band
round
the
legs
of
his
bravest
knights
in
palestine
by
others
it
has
been
asserted
that
it
arose
from
the
word
garter
having
been
used
as
a
watchword
by
edward
at
the
battle
of
cressy
others
again
have
stoutly
maintained
that
its
ringlike
form
bore
mysterious
reference
to
the
round
table
but
the
popular
legend
to
which
despite
the
doubts
thrown
upon
it
credence
still
attaches
declares
its
origin
to
be
as
follows
joan
countess
of
salisbury
a
beautiful
dame
of
whom
edward
was
enamoured
while
dancing
at
a
high
festival
accidentally
slipped
her
garter
of
blue
embroidered
velvet
it
was
picked
up
by
her
royal
partner
who
noticing
the
significant
looks
of
his
courtiers
on
the
occasion
used
the
words
to
them
which
afterwards
became
the
motto
of
the
order
honi
soit
qui
mal
y
pense
adding
that
in
a
short
time
they
should
see
that
garter
advanced
to
so
high
honour
and
estimation
as
to
account
themselves
happy
to
wear
but
whatever
may
have
originated
the
order
it
unquestionably
owes
its
establishment
to
motives
of
policy
wise
as
valiant
and
bent
upon
prosecuting
his
claim
to
the
crown
of
france
edward
as
a
means
of
accomplishing
his
object
resolved
to
collect
beneath
his
standard
the
best
knights
in
europe
and
to
lend
a
colour
to
the
design
he
gave
forth
that
he
intended
a
restoration
of
king
arthur
round
table
and
accordingly
commenced
constructing
within
the
castle
a
large
circular
building
of
two
hundred
feet
in
diameter
in
which
he
placed
a
round
table
on
the
completion
of
the
work
he
issued
proclamations
throughout
england
scotland
france
burgundy
flanders
brabant
and
the
empire
inviting
all
knights
desirous
of
approving
their
valour
to
a
solemn
feast
and
jousts
to
be
holden
within
the
castle
of
windsor
on
saint
george
day
the
scheme
was
completely
successful
the
flower
of
the
chivalry
of
europe
excepting
that
of
philip
the
sixth
of
france
who
seeing
through
the
design
interdicted
the
attendance
of
his
present
at
the
tournament
which
was
graced
by
edward
and
his
chief
nobles
together
with
his
queen
and
three
hundred
of
her
fairest
dames
adorned
with
all
imaginable
at
this
chivalrous
convocation
the
institution
of
the
order
of
the
garter
was
arranged
but
before
its
final
establishment
edward
assembled
his
principal
barons
and
knights
to
determine
upon
the
regulations
when
it
was
decided
that
the
number
should
be
limited
to
the
first
installation
took
place
on
the
anniversary
of
saint

patron

bareheaded

the
chapel

recently
rebuilt

mass
was
performed
by
william

they
partook
of

and
on

in

edward
outshone
all

doings
by
a
tournament

he
gave
in

of
his

the
queen
of

edward
sister
was
present
at

jousts
and
it
is
said
that
john
commenting
upon
the
splendour
of
the
spectacle
shrewdly
observed
that
he
never
saw
or
knew
such
royal
shows
and
feastings
without
some
the
same
monarch
replied
to
his
kingly
captor
who
sought
to
rouse
him
from
dejection
on
another
occasion
quomodo
cantabimus
canticum
in
terra
aliena
that
his
works
might
not
be
retarded
for
want
of
hands
edward
in
the
year
of
his
reign
appointed
john
de
sponlee
master
of
the
stonehewers
with
a
power
not
only
to
take
and
keep
as
well
within
the
liberties
as
without
as
many
masons
and
other
artificers
as
were
necessary
and
to
convey
them
to
windsor
but
to
arrest
and
imprison
such
as
should
disobey
or
refuse
with
a
command
to
all
sheriffs
mayors
bailiffs
to
assist
these
powers
were
fully
acted
upon
at
a
later
period
when
some
of
the
workmen
having
left
their
employment
were
thrown
into
newgate
while
the
place
of
others
who
had
been
carried
off
by
a
pestilence
then
raging
in
the
castle
was
supplied
by
impressment
in
william
of
wykeham
was
constituted
superintendent
of
the
works
with
the
same
powers
as
john
de
sponlee
and
his
appointment
marks
an
important
era
in
the
annals
of
the
castle
originally
secretary
to
edward
the
third
this
remarkable
man
became
bishop
of
winchester
and
prelate
of
the
garter
when
he
solicited
the
bishopric
it
is
said
that
edward
told
him
he
was
neither
a
priest
nor
a
scholar
to
which
he
replied
that
he
would
soon
be
the
one
and
in
regard
to
the
other
he
would
make
more
scholars
than
all
the
bishops
of
england
ever
did
he
made
good
his
word
by
founding
the
collegiate
school
at
winchester
and
erecting
new
college
at
oxford
when
the
winchester
tower
was
finished
he
caused
the
words
hoc
fecit
wykeham
to
be
carved
upon
it
and
the
king
offended
at
his
presumption
wykeham
turned
away
his
displeasure
by
declaring
that
the
inscription
meant
that
the
castle
had
made
him
and
not
that
he
had
made
the
castle
it
is
a
curious
coincidence
that
this
tower
after
a
lapse
of
four
centuries
and
a
half
should
become
the
residence
of
an
architect
possessing
the
genius
of
wykeham
and
who
like
him
had
rebuilt
the
kingly
edifice
sir
jeffry
wyatville
william
of
wykeham
retired
from
office
loaded
with
honours
in
and
was
succeeded
by
william
de
mulso
he
was
interred
in
the
cathedral
at
winchester
his
arms
were
argent
two
chevrons
sable
between
three
roses
gules
with
the
motto
manners
maketh
in
holinshed
relates
that
the
king
set
workmen
in
hand
to
take
down
much
old
buildings
belonging
to
the
castle
and
caused
divers
other
fine
and
sumptuous
works
to
be
set
up
in
and
about
the
same
castle
so
that
almost
all
the
masons
and
carpenters
that
were
of
any
account
in
the
land
were
sent
for
and
employed
about
the
same
the
old
buildings
here
referred
to
were
probably
the
remains
of
the
palace
and
keep
of
henry
the
first
in
the
middle
ward
as
the
original
chapel
dedicated
to
saint
george
was
demolished
by
edward
the
fourth
its
position
and
form
can
not
be
clearly
determined
but
a
conjecture
has
been
hazarded
that
it
occupied
the
same
ground
as
the
choir
of
the
present
chapel
and
extended
farther
eastward
upon
the
question
of
its
style
says
poynter
from
whose
valuable
account
of
the
castle
much
information
has
been
derived
there
is
the
evidence
of
two
fragments
discovered
near
this
site
a
corbel
and
a
piscina
ornamented
with
foliage
strongly
characteristic
of
the
decorated
english
gothic
and
indicating
by
the
remains
of
colour
on
their
surfaces
that
they
belonged
to
an
edifice
adorned
in
the
polychromatic
style
so
elaborately
developed
in
the
chapel

built

erected
within
the
castle
the
famous
appeal
for
high
treason
was
made
by
henry
of
lancaster
duke
of
hereford
against
thomas
mowbray
duke
of
norfolk
the
latter
of
whom
defied
his
accuser
to
mortal
combat
the
duel
was
stopped
by
the
king
and
the
adversaries
banished
but
the
duke
of
lancaster
afterwards
returned
to
depose
his
banisher
about
the
same
time
the
citizens
of
london
having
refused
richard
a
large
loan
he
summoned
the
lord
mayor
sheriffs
aldermen
and
of
the
principal
citizens
to
his
presence
and
after
rating
them
soundly
ordered
them
all
into

reign
geoffrey
chaucer
the
father
of
english
poetry
was
appointed
clerk
to
the
works
of
saint
george
chapel
at
a
salary
of
two
shillings
per
day
a
sum
equal
to
pounds
per

of
modern
money
with
the
same
arbitrary
power
as
had
been
granted
to
previous
surveyors
to
impress
carpenters
and
masons
chaucer
did
not
retain
his
appointment
more
than
twenty
months
and
was
succeeded
by
john
gedney
it
was
at
windsor
that
henry
the
fourth
scarcely
assured
of
the
crown
he
had
seized
received
intelligence
of
a
conspiracy
against
his
life
from
the
traitorous
aumerle
who
purchased
his
own
safety
at
the
expense
of
his
confederates
the
timely
warning
enabled
the
king
to
baffle
the
design
it
was
in
windsor
also
that
the
children
of
mortimer
earl
of
march
the
rightful
successor
to
the
throne
were
detained
as
hostages
for
their
father
liberated
by
the
of
gloucester
who
contrived
to
open
their
prison
door
with
false
keys
the
youthful
captives
escaped
to
the
marshes
of
wales
where
however
they
were
overtaken
by
the
emissaries
of
henry
and
brought
back
to
their
former
place
of
confinement
a
few
years
later
another
illustrious
prisoner
was
brought
to
windsor
namely
prince
james
the
son
of
king
robert
the
third
and
afterwards
james
the
first
of
scotland
this
prince
remained
a
captive
for
upwards
of
eighteen
years
not
being
released
till
in
the
second
of
henry
the
sixth
by

his
love
for
jane
of
beaufort
daughter
of
the
duke
of
somerset
and
granddaughter
to
john
of
gaunt
to
whom
he
was
united
have
breathed
a
charm
over
the
round
tower
where
he
was
confined
and
his
memory
like
that
of
the
chivalrous
and
poetical
surrey
whom
he
resembled
in
character
and
accomplishments
will
be
ever
associated
with
it
in
the
king
quair
the
royal
poet
has
left
an
exquisite
picture
of
a
garden
nook
contrived
within
the
dry
moat
of
the
dungeon
now
was
there
made
fast
by
the
tower
wall
a
garden
faire
and
in
the
corners
set
an
arbour
green
with
wandis
long
and
small
railed
about
and
so
with
leaves
beset
was
all
the
place
and
hawthorn

knet
that
lyf
was
none
walking
there
forbye
that
might
within
scarce
any
wight
espy
so
thick
the
branches
and
the
leave
green
beshaded
all
the
alleys
that
there
were
and
midst
of
every
harbour
might
be
seen
the
sharpe
green
sweet
juniper
growing
so
fair
with
branches
here
and
there
that
as
it
seemed
to
a
lyf
without
the
boughs
did
spread
the
arbour
all
and
he
thus
describes
the
first
appearance
of
the
lovely
jane
and
the
effect
produced
upon
him
by
her
charms
and
therewith
cast
i
down
mine
eye
again
where
as
i
saw
walking
under
the
tower
full
secretly
new
comyn
her
to
plain
the
fairest
and
the
freshest
younge
flower
that
i
saw
methought
before
that
hour
for
which
sudden
abate
anon
did
start
the
blood
of
all
my
body
to
my
henry
the
fifth
occasionally
kept
his
court
at
windsor
and
in
entertained
with
great
magnificence
the
emperor
sigismund
who
brought
with
him
an
invaluable
relic
the
heart
of
saint
george
which
he
bestowed
upon
the
chapter
the
emperor
was
at
the
same
time
invested
with
the
order
in
the
unfortunate
henry

sixth
was
born
within
the
castle
and
in
he
was
interred
within
it
iii
comprising
the
fourth
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
castle
and
showing
how
saint
george
chapel
was
rebuilt
by
king
edward
the
fourth
finding
the
foundation
and
walls
of
saint
george
chapel
much
dilapidated
and
decayed
edward
the
fourth
resolved
to
pull
down
the
pile
and
build
a
larger
and
statelier
structure
in
its
place
with
this
view
he
constituted
richard
beauchamp
bishop
of
salisbury
surveyor
of
the
works
from
whose
designs
arose
the
present
beautiful
edifice
to
enable
the
bishop
to
accomplish
the
work
power
was
given
him
to
remove
all
obstructions
and
to
enlarge
the
space
by
the
demolition
of
the
three
buildings
then
commonly
called
clure
tower
berner
tower
and
the
almoner
tower
the
zeal
and
assiduity
with
which
beauchamp
prosecuted
his
task
is
adverted
to
in
the
patent
of
his
appointment
to
the
office
of
chancellor
of
the
garter
the
preamble
whereof
recites
that
out
of
mere
love
towards
the
order
he
had
given
himself
the
leisure
daily
to
attend
the
advancement
and
progress
of
this
goodly
the
chapel
however
was
not
completed
in
one
reign
or
by
one
architect
sir
reginald
bray
prime
minister
of
henry
the
seventh
succeeded
bishop
beauchamp
as
surveyor
of
the
works
and
it
was
by
him
that
the
matchless
roof
of
the
choir
and
other
parts
of
the
fabric
were
built
indeed
the
frequent
appearance
of
bray
arms
sometimes
single
sometimes
impaling
his
alliances
in
many
parts
of
the
ceiling
and
windows
has
led
to
the
supposition
that
he
himself
contributed
largely
to
the
expense
of
the
work
the
groined
ceiling
of
the
chapel
was
not
commenced
till
the
year
of
the
reign
of
henry
the
seventh
when
the
pinnacles
of
the
roof
were
decorated
with
vanes
supported
by
gilt
figures
of
lions
antelopes
greyhounds
and
dragons
the
want
of
which
is
still
a
detriment
to
the
external
beauty
of
the
structure
the
main
vaulting
of
george
chapel
says
poynter
is
perhaps
without
exception
the
most
beautiful
specimen
of
the
gothic
stone
roof
in
existence
but
it
has
been
very
improperly
classed
with
those
of
the
same
architectural
period
in
the
chapels
of
king
college
cambridge
and
henry
the
seventh
at
westminster
the
roofing
of
the
aisle
and
the
centre
compartment
of
the
body
of
the
building
are
indeed
in
that
style
but
the
vault
of
the
nave
and
choir
differ
essentially
from
fan
vaulting
both
in
drawing
and
construction
it
is
in
fact
a
vault
broken
by
welsh
groins
that
is
to
say
groins
which
cut
into
the
main
arch
below
the
apex
it
is
not
singular
in
the
principle
of
its
design
but
it
is
unique
in
its
proportions
in
which
the
exact
mean
seems
to
be
attained
between
the
poverty
and
monotony
of
a
ceiling
and
the
ungraceful
effect
of
a
mere
groined
roof
with
a
depressed
roof
or
large
span
to
which
may
be
added
that
with
a
richness
of
effect
scarcely
if
at
all
inferior
to
fan
tracery
it
is
free
from
those
abrupt
junctions
of
the
lines
and
other
defects
of
drawing
inevitable
when
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
compartments
of
fan
vaulting
differ
very
much
of
which
king
college
chapel
exhibits
some
notable
supported
by
these
exquisite
ribs
and
groins
the
ceiling
is
decorated
with
heraldic
insignia
displaying
the
arms
of
edward
the
confessor
edward
the
third
edward
the
black
prince
henry
the
sixth
edward
the
fourth
henry
the

rampant
unicorn
dragon
and

feathers
together
with
the
arms
of
a
multitude
of
noble
families
in

nave
are
emblazoned
the
arms
of
henry
the
eighth
and
of
several
among
which
are
those
of
charles
the
fifth
francis
the
first
and
ferdinand
infant
of
spain
the
extreme
lightness
and
graceful
proportions
of
the
pillars
lining
the
aisles
contribute
greatly
to
the
effect
of
this
part
of
the
structure
beautiful
however
as
is
the
body
of
the
chapel
it
is
not
comparable
to
the
choir
here
and
on
either
side
are
ranged
the
stalls
of
the
knights
formerly
in
number
but
now
increased
to
elaborately
carved
in
black
oak
and
covered
by
canopies
of
the
richest
supported
by
slender
pillars
on
the
pedestals
is
represented
the
history
of
the
saviour
and
on
the
front
of
the
stalls
at
the
west
end
of
the
choir
is
carved
the
legend
of
saint
george
while
on
the
outside
of
the
upper
seat
is
cut
in
old
saxon
characters
the
twentieth
psalm
in
latin
on
the
canopies
of
the

are
placed

coat
and

of
the

above
them
are
hung
their
emblazoned
banners
on
the
back
of
each
stall
are
fixed
small
enamelled
plates
graven
with
the
titles
of
the
knights
who
have
occupied
it
the
ancient
stall
of
the
sovereign
was
removed
in
and
a
new
seat
erected
the
altar
was
formerly
adorned
with
costly
hangings
of
crimson
velvet
and
gold
but
these
together
with
the
consecrated
vessels
of
great
value
were
seized
by
order
of
parliament
in
amid
the
general
plunder
of
the
foundation
the
service
of
the
altar
was
replaced
by
charles
the

immediately
on

entrance
to
the
choir
and
the
prince
on
the
left
the
queen
closet
is
on
the
north
side
above
the

beneath
it
is
the
beautiful
and
framework
of
iron
representing
a
pair
of
gates
between
two
gothic
towers
designed
as
a
screen
to
the
tomb
of
edward
the
fourth
and
which
though
popularly
attributed
to
quentin
matsys
has
with
more
justice
been
assigned
to
master
john
tressilian
one
great
blemish
to
the
chapel
exists
in
the
window
over
the
altar
the
mullions
and
tracery
of
which
have
been
removed
to
make
way
for
dull
colourless
copies
in
painted
glass
of
west
designs
instead
of
blushing
with
the
blood
of
kings
and
twilight
saints
and
dim
emblazonings
steeping
the
altar
in
rich
suffusion
chequering
the
walls
and
pavement
with
variegated
hues
and
filling
the
whole
sacred
spot
with
a
warm
and
congenial
glow
these
panes
produce
a
cold
cheerless
and
most
disagreeable
effect
the
removal
of
this
objectionable
feature
and
the
restoration
of
framework
and
compartments
in
the
style
of
the
original
and
enriched
with
ancient
and
glass
in
keeping
with
the
place
are
absolutely
indispensable
to
the
completeness
and
unity
of
character
of
the
chapel
two
clerestory
windows
at
the
east
end
of
the
choir
adjoining
the
larger
window
have
been
recently
filled
with
stained
glass
in
much
better
taste
the
objections
above
made
may
be
urged
with
equal
force
against
the
east
and
west
windows
of
the
south
aisle
of
the
body
of
the
fane
and
the
west
window
of
the
north

the
glorious
west
window
composed
of
eighty
compartments
embellished
with
figures
of
kings
patriarchs
and
bishops
together
with
the
insignia
of
the
garter
and
the
arms
of
the
prelates
the
wreck
gathered
from
all
the
other
windows
and
streaming
with
the
radiance
of
the
setting
sun
upon
the
broad
nave
and
graceful
pillars
of
the
aisles
this
superb
window
an
admirable
specimen
of
the
architecture
of
the
age
in
which
it
was
designed
had
shared
the
fate
of
the
others
and
was
only
preserved
from
desecration
by
the
circumstance
of
the
death
of
the
the
mullions
of
this
window
being
found
much
decayed
were
carefully
and
consistently
restored
during
the
last
year
by
blore
and
the
ancient
stained
glass
replaced
not
only
does
saint
george
chapel
form
a
house
of
prayer
and
a
temple
of
chivalry
but
it
is
also
the
of
kings
at
the
east
end
of
the
north
aisle
of
the
choir
is
a
plain
flag
bearing
the
words

coat
of
mail
and
surcoat
decorated
with
rubies

together
with
other
rich
trophies

ornamenting
this
tomb
were
carried
off
by
the
parliamentary
plunderers
edward

it
was
thought
slept
beside
him
but
when
the
royal
tomb
was
opened
in
and
the
two
coffins
within
it
examined
the
smaller
one
was
found
empty
the

subsequently
discovered
in
a
stone
coffin
by
the
workmen
employed
in
excavating
the

seven
feet
long

contained
a
perfect
skeleton

the

sumptuously
embellished

the
of
which
may
still
be
seen
his
arms
supported
by
two
antelopes
connected
by
a
golden
chain
henry
body
was
removed
from
chertsey
where
it
was
first
interred
and
reburied
in
with
much
solemnity
in
this
spot
such
was
the
opinion
entertained
of
his
sanctity
that
miracles
were
supposed
to
be
wrought
upon
his
tomb
and
henry
the
seventh
applied
to
have
him
canonised
but
the
demands
of
the
pope
were
too
exorbitant
the
proximity
of
henry
and
edward
in
death
suggested
the
following
lines
to
pope
here

and
fast
beside

the
hasty
enumeration
of
the
different

tombhouse
commenced
by
henry
the
seventh
as
a
mausoleum
but
abandoned
for
the
chapel
in
westminster
abbey
this
structure
was
granted
by
henry
the
eighth
to
wolsey
who
intending
it
as
a
place
of
burial
for
himself
erected
within
it
a
sumptuous
monument
of
black
and
white
marble
with
eight
large
brazen
columns
placed
around
it
and
four
others
in
the
form
of
candlesticks
at
the
time
of
the
cardinal
disgrace
when
the
building
reverted
to
the
crown
the
monument
was
far
advanced
towards
completion
the
vast
sum
of
ducats

been
paid
to
benedetto

florentine
sculptor
for
work

nearly
four
hundred
pounds
for
gilding

escaped
destruction

now
covers

a
crypt
of

cathedral
henry
the

was
not
interred
in
this
mausoleum
but
in
saint
george
chapel
as
has
just
been
mentioned
and
as
he
himself
directed
midway
between
the
state
and
the
high
full
instructions
were
left
by
him
for
the
erection
of
a
monument
which
if
it
had
been
completed
would
have
been
truly
magnificent
the
pavement
was
to
be
of
oriental
stones
with
two
great
steps
upon
it
of

two
pillars

marble
the
epitaphs
of
the
king

were
to

to
be
two
tombs
of
black
touchstone
supporting
the
images
of
the

so
runs
the

at
either
corner
of

candlestick
and
at
the
opposite
corners
two
other
angels
hearing
the
queen

and
candlesticks
between
the
two
black

was
to
rise
a
high
basement
like
a
sepulchre
surmounted
by
a
statue
of
the

figures
to

whole
stature
of

number
of
statues
was
to
be
one
hundred

with
it
would
be
matter
of
infinite
regret
that

never
executed

its
destruction

the
parliamentary
plunderers
would
not
in
that

have
been
also

of
certainty
charles
the
first
intended
to
fit
up
this
structure
as
a
royal
mausoleum
but
was
diverted
from
the
plan
by
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
it
was
afterwards
used
as
a
chapel
by
james
the
second
and
mass
was
publicly
performed
in
it
the
ceiling
was
painted
by
verrio
and
the
walls
highly
ornamented
but
the
decorations
were
greatly
injured
by
the
fury
of
an
mob
who
assailed
the
building
and
destroyed
its
windows
on
the
occasion
of
a
banquet
given
to
the
pope
nuncio
by
the
king
in
this
state
it
continued
till
the
commencement
of

present
century
when
the
exterior
was
repaired
by
george
the
third
and
a

from
which
the
desire
to
bring
down
the
history
of

to
the
present
time
has
led
to
the
foregoing
digression
about
the
same
time
that
the
chapel
was
built
habitations
for
the
dean
and
canons
were
erected
on
the
of
the
fane
while
another

was
built
at

west
end

in
the
form
of
a
fetterlock

of
the
badges
of
edward
the
fourth
and
since
called
the
cloisters
the
ambulatory
of
these
cloisters
once
displayed
a
fine
specimen
of
the
timber
architecture
of
henry
the
seventh
time
when
they
were
repaired
but
little
of
their
original
character
can
now
be
discerned
in
edward

of
advancing
his
popularity
with
the
citizens
of

still
bears
the

building
looking
towards
the

originally
decorated
with
two
rich
windows
but
one
of
them
has
disappeared
and
the
other
has
suffered

the
date
of
which
is
uncertain
though
it
may
perhaps
be
referred
to
this
period
the
establishment

enriched
in
later
times
by
a
valuable
library
bequeathed
to
it
by
the
earl
of
ranelagh
in
windsor
was
the
scene
of
great
festivity
in
consequence
of
the
unexpected
arrival
of
philip
king
of
castile
and
his
queen
who
had
been
driven
by
stress
of
weather
into
weymouth
the
royal
visitors
remained
for
several
weeks
at
the
castle
during
which
it
continued
a
scene
of
revelry
intermixed
with
the
sports
of
the
chase
at
the

time
philip
was
invested
with
the
order

edward
the

was
removed
for
safety
to
windsor
by
the
lord
protector
somerset
and
here
at
a
later
period
the
youthful
monarch
received
a
letter
from
the
council
urging
the
dismissal
of
somerset
with
which
by
the
advice
of
the
of
canterbury
he
complied
in
this
reign
an
undertaking
to
convey
water
to
the
castle
from
blackmore
park
near
wingfield
a
distance
of
five
miles
was
commenced
though
it
was
not
till
in
the
time
of
mary
that
the
plan
was
accomplished
when
a
pipe
was
brought
into
the
upper
ward
and
there
the
water
plenteously
did
rise
thirteen
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
court
was
erected
a
magnificent
fountain
consisting
of
a
canopy
raised
upon
columns
gorgeously
decorated
with
heraldic
ornaments
and
surmounted
by
a
great
vane
with
the
arms
of
philip
and
mary
impaled
upon
it
and
supported
by
a
lion
and
an
eagle
gilt
and
painted
the
water
was
discharged
by
a
great
dragon
one
of
the
supporters
of
the
tudor
arms
into
the
cistern
beneath
whence
it
was
conveyed
by
pipes
to
every
part
of

mary
held
her
court
at
windsor
soon
after
her
union
with
philip
of
spain
about
this
period
the
old
habitations
of
the
on
the
south
side
of
the
lower
quadrangle
were
taken
down
and
others
erected
in
their
stead
fewer
additions
were
made
to
windsor
castle
by
elizabeth
than
might
have
been
expected
from
her
predilection
for
it
as
a
place
of
residence
she
extended
and
widened
the
north
terrace
where
when
lodging
within
the
castle
she
daily
took
exercise
whatever
might
be
the
weather
the
terrace
at
this
time
as
it
is
described
by
paul
hentzner
and
as
it
appears
in
norden
view
was
a
sort
of
balcony
projecting
beyond
the
scarp
of

and
supported
by
great
cantilevers
of

in
the
gallery

bearing
her
name
and
lying
between
henry
the
seventh
buildings
and
the
norman
tower

erected
by
elizabeth
this
portion
of
the
castle
had
the
good
fortune
to
escape
the
alterations
and
modifications
made
in
almost
every
other
part
of
the
upper
ward
after
the
restoration
of
charles
the
second

now
forms
the
library
a
large
garden
was
laid
out
by
the
same
queen
and
a
small
gateway
on
castle
hill
built
by
her
which
afterwards
became
one
of
the
greatest
obstructions
to
the
approach
and
it
was
taken
down
by
george
the
fourth
elizabeth
often
hunted
in
the
parks
and
exhibited
her
skill
in
archery
which
was
by
no
means
inconsiderable
at
the
butts
her
fondness
for
dramatic
performances
likewise
induced
her
to
erect
a
stage
within
the
castle
on
which
plays
and
interludes
were
performed
and
to
her
admiration
of
the
character
of

parks
christian
the
fourth
of
denmark
was
sumptuously
entertained
by
him
at
windsor
in
this
reign
a
curious
dispute
occurred
between
the
king
and
the
dean
and
chapter
respecting
the
repair
of
a
breach
in
the
wall
which
was
not
brought
to
issue
for
three
years
when
after
much
argument
it
was
decided
in
favour
of
the
clergy
little
was
done
at
windsor
by
charles
the
first
until
the
tenth
year
of
his
reign
when
a
erected
by
elizabeth
was
taken
down
and
the
magnificent
fountain
constructed
by
queen

demolished
two
years
after

lantern
with
a
clock

was
ordered
to
be
set
up
in

of
the
castle

a
balcony
was
erected
before
the
room
where
henry
the
sixth
was
born
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
charles
retired
to
windsor
to
shield
himself
from
the
insults
of
the
populace
and
was
followed
by
a
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
who
prevailed
upon
him
to
desist
from
the
prosecution
of
the
impeached
members
on
the
of
october
in
the
same
year
captain
fogg
at
the
head
of
a
parliamentarian
force
demanded
the
keys
of
the
college
treasury
and
not
being
able
to
obtain
them
forced
open
the
doors
and
carried
off
the
whole
of
the
plate
the
plunder
of
the
college
was
completed
by
vane
the
parliamentary
governor
of
the
castle
who
seized
upon
the
whole
of
the
furniture
and
decorations
of
the
choir
rifled
the
tomb
of
edward
the
fourth
stripped
off
all
the
costly
ornaments
from
wolsey
tomb
defaced
the
emblazonings
over
henry
the

grave
broke
the
rich
painted

wantonly
destroyed
the
exquisite
woodwork
of

the
close
of

year
the
charles
was
brought
a
prisoner
to
windsor
where

were
made

prison
of
the
earl

norwich
lord
capel
and
the
duke
of
hamilton
and
other
royalists
and
cavaliers
cromwell
frequently
resided
within
the
castle
and
often
took
a
moody
and
distrustful
walk
upon
the
terrace
it
was
during
the
protectorate
in
that
the
ugly
buildings
appropriated
to
the
naval
knights
and
standing
between
the
garter
tower
and
chancellor
tower
were
erected
by
sir
francis

containing
the
history
of
the
castle
from
the
reign
of

to
that
of
george
the
third
with
a
few
particulars
concerning
the
parks
and
the
forest
windsor
castle
on
the
restoration
the
castle
resumed
its
splendour
and
presented
a
striking
contrast
to
the
previous
gloomy
period
the
terrace
with
its
festive
groups
resembled
a
picture
by
watteau
the
courts
resounded
with
laughter
and
the
velvet
sod
of
the
home
park
was
as
often
pressed
by
the
foot
of
frolic
beauty
as
by
that
of
the
tripping
deer
seventeen
state
apartments
were
erected
by
sir
christopher
wren
under
the
direction
of
sir
john
denham
the
ceilings
were
painted
by
verrio
and
the
walls
decorated
with
exquisite
carvings
by
grinling
gibbons
a
grand
staircase
was
added
at
the
same
time
most
of
the
chambers
were
hung
with
tapestry
and
all
adorned
with
pictures
and
costly
furniture
the
addition
made
to
the
castle
by
charles
was
the
part
of
the
north
front
then
called
the
star
building
from
the
star
of
the
order
of
the
garter
worked
in
colours
in
the
front
of
it
but
now
denominated
the
stuart
building
extending
eastward
along
the
terrace
from
henry
the
seventh
building
one
hundred
and
seventy
feet
in
the
ditch
was
filled
up
and
the
terrace
carried
along
the
south
and
east
fronts
of
the
castle
meanwhile
the
original
character
of
the
castle
was
completely
destroyed
and
italianised
the
beautiful
and
picturesque
irregularities
of
the
walls
were
removed
the
towers
shaved
off
the
windows
transformed
into
commonplace
apertures
and
so
the
castle
remained
for
more
than
a
century
edward
the
third
tower
indifferently
called
the
earl
tower
and
the
devil
tower
and
used
as
a
place
of
confinement
for
state
prisoners
was
now
allotted
to
the
maids
of
honour
it
was
intended
by
charles
to
erect
a
monument
in
honour
of
his
martyred
father
on
the
site
of
the
which
he
proposed
to
remove
and
pounds
were
voted
by
parliament
for
this
purpose
the
design
however
was
abandoned
under
the
plea
that
the
body
could
not
be
found
though
it
was
perfectly
well
known
where
it
lay
the
real
motive
probably
was
that
charles
had
already
spent
the
money
in
an
equestrian
statue
of
charles
the
second
executed
by
strada
at
the
expense
of

the
sculptures
on
the
pedestal
were
designed
by
grinling
gibbons
and
horace
walpole
pleasantly
declared
that
the
statue
had
no
other
merit
than
to
attract
attention
to
them
in
old
times
a
road
forming
a
narrow
irregular
avenue
ran
through
the
woods
from
the
foot
of
the
castle
to
snow
hill
but
this
road
having
been
neglected
during
a
long
series
of
years
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
underwood
had
so
much
encroached
upon
it
as
to
render
it
wholly
impassable
a
grand
avenue
two
hundred
and
forty
feet
wide
was
planned
by
charles
in
its
place
and
the
magnificent
approach
called

laid
out
and
planted
the
only
material
incident
connected
with
the
castle
during
the
reign
of
james
the
second
has
been
already
related
windsor
was
not
so
much
favoured
as
hampton
court
by
william
the
third
though
he
contemplated
alterations
within
it
during
the
latter
part
of
his
life
which
it
may
be
matter
of
rejoicing

planted
by

was
also
planned
on
the

side
of

sir
james
thornhill
commenced
painting
charles
the

staircase
with
designs
from

metamorphoses
but
did
not
complete
his
task
till
after
the
accession
of

this
staircase
was
removed
in
to
make
way
for
the
present
gothic
entrance
erected
by
the

the

two
monarchs
of

rarely
used

as
a
residence
preferring

did
not
actually
live
in
the

but
in
the
queen
lodge

large
detached
building
with
no
pretension
to
architectural
beauty
which
he
himself
erected
opposite
the
south
terrace
at
a
cost
of
nearly
pounds
with
most
praiseworthy
zeal
and
almost
entirely
at
his
own
expense
this
monarch
undertook
the
restoration
of
saint
chapel
the
work
was
commenced
in
occupied
three
years
and
was
executed
by
emlyn

local
architect
the
whole

was
repaved

added
and
the
carving
restored
in
james
wyatt
was
appointed
of
the
royal
buildings
and
effected
many
internal
arrangements
externally
he
restored
wren
windows
to
their
original
form
and
at
the
same
time
gothicized
a
large
portion
of
the
north
and
south
sides
of
the
upper
ward
before
proceeding
further
a
word
must
be
said
about
the
parks
the
home
park
which
lies
on
the
east
and
north
sides
of
the
castle
is
about
four
miles
in
circumference
and
was
enlarged
and
enclosed
with
a
brick
wall
by
william
the
third
on
the
east
and
nearly
on
the
site
of
the
present
sunk
garden
a
was
laid
out
by
charles
the
second
below
on
the
north
were
queen
anne
gardens
since
whose
time
the
declivity
of
the
hill
has
been
planted
with
forest
trees
at
the
east
angle
of
the
north
terrace
are
the
beautiful
slopes
with
a
path
skirting
the
north
side
of
the
home
park
and
leading
through
charming
plantations
in
the
direction
of
the
royal
farm
and
dairy
the
lodge
and
the
kennel
for
the
queen
harriers
this
park
contains
many
noble
trees
and
the
grove
of
elms
in
the
near
the
spot
where
the
scathed
oak
assigned
to
herne
stands
is
traditionally
asserted
to
have
been
a
favourite
walk
of
queen
elizabeth
it
still
retains
her
name
the
great
park
is
approached
by
the
magnificent
avenue
called
the
long
walk
laid
out
as
has
been
stated
by
charles
the
second
and
extending
to
the
foot
of
snow
hill
the
summit
of
which
is
crowned
by
the
colossal
equestrian
statue
of
george
the
third
by
westmacott
not
far
from
this
point
stands
cumberland
lodge
which
derives
its
name
from
william
duke
of
cumberland
to
whom
it
was
granted
in
according
to
survey
in
this
park
contained
acres
but
when
surveyed
by
george
the
third
it
was
found
to
consist
of
acres
of
which
were
covered
with
water
at
that
time
the
park
was
over
grown
with
fern
and
rushes
and
abounded
in
bogs
and
swamps
which
in
many
places
were
dangerous
and
almost
impassable
it
contained
about
three
thousand
head
of
deer
in
bad
condition
the
park
has
since
been
thoroughly
drained
smoothed
and
new
planted
in
parts
and
two
farms
have
been
introduced
upon
it
under
the
direction
of
kent
at
which
the
flemish
and
norfolk
modes
of
husbandry
have
been
successfully
practised
boasting
every
variety
of
forest
scenery
and
commanding
from
its
knolls
and
acclivities
magnificent
views
of
the
castle
the
great
park
is
traversed
in
all
directions
by
green
drives
threading
its
long
vistas
or
crossing
its
open
glades
laid
out
by
george
the
fourth
amid
the
groves
at
the
back
of
spring
hill
in
a
charmingly
sequestered
situation
stands
a
small
private
chapel
built
in
the
gothic
style
and
which
was
used
as
a
place
of
devotion
by
george
the
fourth
during
the
progress
of
the
improvements
at
the
castle
and
is
sometimes
attended
by
the
present
queen
not
the
least
of
the
attractions
of
the
park
is
virginia
water
with
its
bright
and
beautiful
expanse
its
cincture
of
green
banks
soft
and
smooth
as
velvet
its
screen
of
noble
woods
its
chinese
its
frigates
its
ruins
its
cascade
cave
and
druidical
temple
its
obelisk
and
bridges
with
numberless
beauties
besides
which
it
would
be
superfluous
to
describe
here
this
artificial
mere
covers
pretty
nearly
the
same
surface
of
ground
as
that
occupied
by
the
great
lake
of
olden
times
windsor
forest
once
comprehended
a
circumference
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
and
comprised
part
of
buckinghamshire
a
considerable
portion
of
surrey
and
the
whole
side
of
berkshire
as
far
as
hungerford
on
the
surrey
side
it
included
chobham
and
chertsey
and
extended
along
the
side
of
the
wey
which
marked
its
limits
as
far
as
guildford
in
the
reign
of
james
the
first
when
it
was
surveyed
by
norden
its
circuit
was
estimated
at
miles
and
a
half
exclusive
of
the
liberties
extending
into
buckinghamshire
there
were
fifteen
walks
within
it
each
under
the
charge
of
a
head
keeper
and
the
whole
contained
upwards
of
three
thousand
head
of
deer
it
is
now
almost
wholly
enclosed
the
last
great
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
castle
a
prince
of
consummate
taste
and
fine
conceptions
george
the
fourth
meditated
and
what
is
better
accomplished
the
restoration
of
the
castle
to
more
than
its
original
grandeur
he
was
singularly
fortunate
in
his
architect
sir
jeffry
wyatville
was
to
him
what
william
of
wykeham
had
been
to
edward
the
third
all
the
incongruities
of
successive
reigns
were
removed
all
or
nearly
all
the
injuries
inflicted
by
time
repaired
and
when
the
work
so
well
commenced
was
finished
the
structure
took
its
place
as
the
noblest
and
most
majestic
palatial
residence
in
existence
to
enter
into
a
full
detail
of
wyatville
achievements
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
present
work
but
a
brief
survey
may
be
taken
of
them
never
was
lofty

more
fully
realised

the
north
with
its
grand
terrace
of
nearly
a
thousand

superb
facade
comprehending
the
stately
brunswick

then
turn
to

to
the
south

at
all
these

considered

round

with
the

of

the
alterations
made
by

architects
have
been
of

splendour
and
importance
around
the
south

east
sides
of
the
court
at
which
you
are
gazing
a

gift
to

the
first
and
most
remarkable
characteristic
of
operations
of
sir
jeffry
wyatville
on
the
exterior
observes
poynter
is
the
judgment
with
which
he
has
preserved
the
castle
of
edward
the
third
some
additions
have
been
made
to
it
and
with
striking
effect
as
the
brunswick
tower
and
the
western
tower
of
george
the
fourth
which
so
nobly
terminates
the
approach
from
the
great
park
the
more
modern
buildings
on
the
north
side
have
also
been
assimilated
to
the
rest
but
the
architect
has
yielded
to
no
temptation
to
substitute
his
own
design
for
that
of
william
of
wykeham
and
no
small
difficulties
have
been
combated
and
overcome
for
the
sake
of
preserving
the
outline
of
the
edifice
and
maintaining
the
towers
in
their
original
the
winchester
tower
originally
inhabited
by
william
of
wykeham
was
bestowed
upon
sir
jeffry
wyatville
as
a
residence
by
george
the
fourth
and
on
the
resignation
of
the
distinguished
architect
was
continued
to
him
for
life
by
the
present
queen
the
works
within
the
castle
were
continued
during
the
reign
of
william
the
fourth
and
at
its
close
the
actual
cost
of
the
buildings
had
reached
the
sum
of
pounds
and
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
general
expenditure
up
to
the
present
time
has
exceeded
a
million
and
a
half
of
money
the
view
from
the
summit
of
the
round
tower
is
beyond
description
magnificent
and
commands
twelve
counties
namely
middlesex
essex
hertford
berks
bucks
oxford
wilts
hants
surrey
sussex
kent
and
bedford
while
on
a
clear
day
the
dome
of
saint
paul
may
be
distinguished
from
it
this
tower
was
raised
feet
by
sir
jeffry
wyatville
crowned
with
a
machicolated
battlement
and
surmounted
with
a
the
circumference
of
the
castle
is
feet
the
length
from
east
to
west
feet
and
the
area
exclusive
of
the
terraces
about
twelve
acres
for
the
present
the
works
are
suspended
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
design
of
sir
jeffry
wyatville
will
be
fully
carried
out
in
the
lower
ward
by
the
removal
of
such
houses
on
the
north
as
would
lay
saint
george
chapel
open
to
view
from
this
side
by
the
demolition
of
the
old
incongruous
buildings
lying
westward
of
the
bastion
near
the
hundred
steps
by
the
opening
out
of
the
pointed
roof
of
the
library
the
repair
and
reconstruction
in
their
original
style
of
the
curfew
the
garter
and
the
salisbury
towers
and
the
erection
of
a
lower
terrace
extending
outside
the
castle
from
the
bastion
above
mentioned
to
the
point
of
termination
of
the
improvements
and
accessible
from
the
town
the
construction
of
which
terrace
would
necessitate
the
removal
of
the
disfiguring
and
encroaching
houses
on
the
east
side
of
thames
street
this
accomplished
crane
ugly
buildings
removed
and
the
three
western
towers
laid
open
to
the
court
the
cloisters
consistently
repaired
windsor
castle
would
indeed
be
complete
and
fervently
do
we
hope
that
this
desirable
event
may
be
identified
with
the
reign
of
victoria
thus
ends
the
third
book
of
the
chronicle
of

castle
book
iv
cardinal
wolsey
i
of
the
interview
between
henry
and
catherine
of
arragon
in
the
urswick
chapel
and
how
it
was
interrupted
it
was
now
the
joyous
month
of
june
and
where
is
june
so
joyous
as
within
the
courts
and
halls
of
peerless
windsor
where
does
the
summer
sun
shine
so
brightly
as
upon
its
stately
gardens
and
broad
terraces
its
matchless
parks
its
silver
belting
river
and
its
circumference
of
proud
and
regal
towers
nowhere
in
the
world
at
all
seasons
windsor
is
magnificent
whether
in
winter
she
looks
upon
her
garnitures
of
woods
stripped
of
their
foliage
her
river
covered
with
ice
or
the
wide
expanse
of
country
around
her
sheeted
with
snow
or
in
autumn
gazes
on
the
same
scene
a
world
of
leaves
brown
meadows
or
glowing
cornfields
but
summer
is
her
season
of
beauty
june
is
the
month
when
her
woods
are
fullest
and
greenest
when
her
groves
are
shadiest
her
avenues
most
delicious
when
her
river
sparkles
like
a
diamond
zone
when
town
and
village
mansion
and
cot
church
and
tower
hill
and
vale
the
distant
capital
itself
all
within
view
are
seen
to
the
highest
advantage
at
such
a
season
it
is
impossible
to
behold
from
afar
the
heights
of
windsor
crowned
like
the
phrygian
goddess
by
a
castled
diadem
and
backed
by
lordly
woods
and
withhold
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
and
delight
and
it
is
equally
impossible
at
such
a
season
to
stand
on
the
grand
northern
terrace
and
gaze
first
at
the
proud
pile
enshrining
the
sovereign
mistress
of
the
land
and
then
gaze
on
the
unequalled
prospect
spread
out
before
it
embracing
in
its
wide
range
every
kind
of
beauty
that
the
country
can
boast
and
not
be
struck
with
the
thought
that
the
perfect
and
majestic
castle
in
state
as
wholesome
as
in
state
is
fit
worthy
the
owner
and
the
owner
it
together
with
the
wide
and
smiling
and
populous
district
around
it
form
an
apt
representation
of
the
british
sovereign
and
her
dominions
there
stands
the
castle
dating
back
as
far
as
the
conquest
and
boasting
since
its
foundation
a
succession
of
royal
inmates
while
at
its
foot
lies
a
region
of
unequalled
fertility
and
of
happy
homes
and
loving
loyal
hearts
a
miniature
of
the
old
country
and
its
inhabitants
what
though
the
smiling
landscape
may
he
darkened
by
a
passing
cloud
what
though
a
momentary
gloom
may
gather
round
the
august
brow
of
the
proud
pile
the
cloud
will
speedily
vanish
the
gloom
disperse
and
the
bright
and
sunny
scene
look
yet
brighter
and
sunnier
from
the
contrast
it
was
the
chance
of
the
writer
of
these
lines
upon
one
occasion
to
behold
his
sovereign
under
circumstances
which
he
esteems
singularly
fortunate
she
was
taking
rapid
exercise
with
the
prince
upon
the
south
side
of
the
all
at
once
the
royal
pair
paused
at
the
summit
of
the
ascent
leading
from
george
the
fourth
gateway
the
prince
disappeared
along
the
eastern
terrace
leaving
the
queen
alone
and
there
she
stood
her
slight
faultless
figure
sharply
defined
against
the
clear
sky
nothing
was
wanting
to
complete
the
picture
the
great
of
the
victoria
tower
on
the
one
hand
the
balustrade
of
the
terrace
on
the
other
the
home
park
beyond
it
was
thrilling
to
feel
that
that
small
solitary
figure
comprehended
all
the
might
and
majesty
of
england
and
a
thousand
kindling
aspirations
were
awakened
by
the
thought
but
it
was
as
has
been
said
the
merry
month
of
june
and
windsor
castle
looked
down
in
all
its
magnificence
upon
the
pomp
of
woods
and
upon
the
twelve
fair
and
smiling
counties
lying
within
its
ken
a
joyous
stir
was
within
its
courts
the
gleam
of
arms
and
the
fluttering
of
banners
was
seen
upon
its
battlements
and
towers
and
the
ringing
of
bells
the
beating
of
drums
and
the
fanfares
of
trumpets
mingled
with
the
shouting
of
crowds
and
the
discharge
of
ordnance
amidst
this
tumult
a
grave
procession
issued
from
the
deanery
and
took
its
way
across
the
lower
quadrangle
which
was
thronged
with
officers
and
in
the
direction
of
the
lower
gate
just
as
it
arrived
there
a
distant
gun
was
heard
and
an
answering
peal
was
instantly
fired
from
the
culverins
of
the
curfew
tower
while
a
broad
standard
emblazoned
with
the
arms
of
france
and
england
within
the
garter
and
having
for
supporters
the
english
lion
crowned
and
the
red
dragon
sinister
was
reared
upon
the
keep
all
these
preparations
betokened
the
approach
of
the
king
who
was
returning
to
the
castle
after
six
absence
though
information
of
the
king
visit
to
the
castle
had
only
preceded
him
by
a
few
hours
everything
was
ready
for
his
reception
and
the
greatest
exertions
were
used
to
give
splendour
to
it
in
spite
of
his
stubborn
and
tyrannical
nature
henry
was
a
popular
monarch
and
never
showed
himself
before
his
subjects
but
he
gained
their
applauses
his
love
of
pomp
his
handsome
person
and
manly
deportment
always
winning
him
homage
from
the
multitude
but
at
no
period
was
he
in
a
more
critical
position
than
the
present
the
meditated
divorce
from
catherine
of
arragon
was
a
step
which
found
no
sympathy
from
the
better
portion
of
his
subjects
while
the
union
of
anne
boleyn
an
avowed
lutheran
which
it
was
known
would
follow
it
was
equally
objectionable
the
seeds
of
discontent
had
been
widely
sown
in
the
capital
and
tumults
had
occurred
which
though
promptly
checked
had
nevertheless
alarmed
the
king
coupled
as
they
were
with
the
disapprobation
of
his
ministers
the
sneering
remonstrances
of
france
the
menaces
of
the
papal
see
and
the
open
hostilities
of
spain
but
the
characteristic
obstinacy
of
his
nature
kept
him
firm
to
his
point
and
he
resolved
to
carry
it
be
the
consequences
what
they
might
all
his
efforts
to
win
over
campeggio
proved
fruitless
the
legate
was
deaf
to
his
menaces
or
promises
well
knowing
that
to
aid
anne
boleyn
would
be
to
seriously
affect
the
interests
of
the
church
of
rome
the
affair
however
so
long
and
so
artfully
delayed
was
now
drawing
to
a
close
a
court
was
appointed
by
the
legates
to
be
holden
on
the
of
june
at
blackfriars
to
try
the
question
gardiner
had
been
recalled
from
rome
to
act
as
counsel
for
henry
and
the
monarch
determining
to
appear
by
proxy
at
the
trial
left
his
palace
at
bridewell
the
day
before
it
was
to
come
on
and
set
out
with
anne
boleyn
and
his
chief
attendants
for
windsor
castle
whatever
secret
feelings
might
be
entertained
against
him
henry
was
received
by
the
inhabitants
of
windsor
with
every
demonstration
of
loyalty
and
affection
deafening
shouts
rent
the
air
as
he
approached
blessings
and
good
wishes
were
showered
upon
him
and
hundreds
of
caps
were
flung
into
the
air
but
noticing
that
anne
boleyn
was
received
with
evil
looks
and
in
stern
silence
and
construing
this
into
an
affront
to
himself
henry
not
only
made
slight
and
haughty
acknowledgment
of
the
welcome
given
him
but
looked
out
for
some
pretext
to
manifest
his
displeasure
luckily
none
was
afforded
him
and
he
entered
the
castle
in
a
sullen
mood
the
day
was
spent
in
gentle
exercise
within
the
home
park
and
on
the
terrace
and
the
king
affected
the
utmost
gaiety
and
indifference
but
those
acquainted
with
him
could
readily
perceive
he
was
ill
at
ease
in
the
evening
he
remained
for
some
time
alone
in
his
closet
penning
despatches
and
then
summoning
an
attendant
ordered
him
to
bring
captain
bouchier
into
his
presence
well
bouchier
he
said
as
the
officer
made
his
appearance
have
you
obeyed
my
instructions
in
regard
to
mabel
lyndwood
i
have
my
liege
replied
bouchier
in
obedience
to
your
commands
immediately
after
your
arrival
at
the
castle
i
rode
to
the
forester
hut
and
ascertained
that
the
damsel
was
still
and
looking
as
beautiful
as
ever
i
be
sworn
said
the
king
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
her
my
liege
replied
bouchier
but
i
do
not
think
she
could
have
ever
looked
more
i
am
well
assured
of
it
replied
henry
the
pressure
of
affairs
during
my
absence
from
the
castle
had
banished
her
image
from
my
mind
but
now
it
returns
as
forcibly
as
before
and
you
have
so
arranged
it
that
she
will
be
brought
hither
night
bouchier
replied
in
the
affirmative
it
is
well
pursued
henry
but
what
more
for
you
look
as
if
you
had
something
further
to
your
majesty
will
not
have
forgotten
how
you
exterminated
the
band
of
herne
the
hunter
said
bouchier
mother
of
heaven
no
cried
the
king
starting
up
i
have
not
forgotten
it
what
of
them
ha
have
they
come
to
life
again
do
they
scour
the
parks
once
more
that
were
indeed
a
marvel
what
i
have
to
relate
is
almost
as
great
a
marvel
returned
bouchier
i
have
not
heard
of
the
resurrection
of
the
band
though
for
aught
i
know
it
may
have
occurred
but
herne
has
been
seen
again
in
the
forest
several
of
the
keepers
have
been
scared
by
him
travellers
have
been
affrighted
and
plundered
and
no
one
will
now
cross
the
great
park
after
amazement
cried
henry
again
seating
himself
once
let
the
divorce
be
settled
and
i
will
effectually
check
the
career
of
this
lawless
and
mysterious
pray
heaven
your
majesty
may
be
able
to
do
so
replied
bouchier
but
i
have
always
been
of
opinion
that
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
the
demon
would
be
by
the
aid
of
the
church
he
is
unassailable
by
mortal
it
would
almost
seem
so
said
the
king
and
yet
i
do
not
like
to
yield
to
the
i
shrewdly
suspect
that
old
tristram
lyndwood
the
grandsire
of
the
damsel
upon
whom
your
majesty
has
deigned
to
cast
your
regards
is
in
some
way
or
other
leagued
with
herne
said
bouchier
at
all
events
i
saw
him
with
a
tall
personage
whose
name
i
understand
to
be
valentine
hagthorne
and
who
i
feel
persuaded
must
be
one
of
the
remnants
of
the
demon
hunter
why
did
you
not
arrest
him
inquired
henry
i
did
not
like
to
do
so
without
your
majesty
authority
replied
bouchier
besides
i
could
scarcely
arrest
hagthorne
without
at
the
same
time
securing
the
old
forester
which
might
have
alarmed
the
damsel
but
i
am
ready
to
execute
your
injunctions
let
a
party
of
men
go
in
search
of
hagthorne
replied
henry
and
while
mabel
is
brought
to
the
castle
do
you
arrest
old
tristram
and
keep
him
in
custody
till
i
have
leisure
to
examine
it
shall
be
done
as
you
desire
my
liege
replied
bouchier
bowing
and
departing
shortly
after
this
henry
accompanied
by
anne
boleyn
proceeded
with
his
attendants
to
saint
george
chapel
and
heard
vespers
performed
just
as
he
was
about
to
return
an
usher
advanced
towards
him
and
making
a
profound
reverence
said
that
a
masked
dame
whose
habiliments
proclaimed
her
of
the
highest
rank
craved
a
moment
audience
of
him
where
is
she
demanded
henry
in
the
north
aisle
a
please
your
majesty
replied
the
usher
near
the
urswick
chapel
i
told
her
that
this
was
not
the
place
for
an
audience
of
your
majesty
nor
the
time
but
she
would
not
be
said
nay
and
therefore
at
the
risk
of
incurring
your
sovereign
displeasure
i
have
ventured
to
proffer
her
the
usher
omitted
to
state
that
his
chief
inducement
to
incur
the
risk
was
a
valuable
ring
given
him
by
the
lady
well
i
will
go
to
her
said
the
king
i
pray
you
excuse
me
for
a
short
space
fair
mistress
he
added
to
anne
boleyn
and
quitting
the
choir
he
entered
the
northern
aisle
and
casting
his
eyes
down
the
line
of
noble
columns
by
which
it
is
flanked
and
seeing
no
one
he
concluded
that
the
lady
must
have
retired
into
the
urswick
chapel
and
so
it
proved
for
on
reaching
this
exquisite
little
shrine
he
perceived
a
tall
masked
dame
within
it
clad
in
robes
of
the
richest
black
velvet
as
he
entered
the
chapel
the
lady
advanced
towards
him
and
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
removed
her
mask
disclosing
features
stamped
with
sorrow
and
suffering
but
still
retaining
an
expression
of
the
greatest
dignity
they
were
those
of
catherine
of
arragon
uttering
an
angry
exclamation
henry
turned
on
his
heel
and
would
have
left
her
but
she
clung
to
the
skirts
of
his
robe
hear
me
a
moment
henry
my
king
my
husband
one
single
moment
hear
me
cried
catherine
in
tones
of
such
passionate
anguish
that
he
could
not
resist
the
appeal
be
brief
then
kate
he
rejoined
taking
her
hand
to
raise
her
blessings
on
you
for
the
word
cried
the
queen
covering
his
hand
with
kisses
i
am
indeed
your
own
true
kate
your
faithful
loving
lawful
wife
rise
madam
cried
henry
coldly
this
posture
beseems
not
catherine
of
i
obey
you
now
as
i
have
ever
done
she
replied
rising
though
if
i
followed
the
prompting
of
my
heart
i
should
not
quit
my
knees
till
i
had
gained
my
you
have
done
wrong
in
coming
here
catherine
at
this
juncture
said
henry
and
may
compel
me
to
some
harsh
measure
which
i
would
willingly
have
no
one
knows
i
am
here
replied
the
queen
except
two
faithful
attendants
who
are
vowed
to
secrecy
and
i
shall
depart
as
i
i
am
glad
you
have
taken
these
precautions
replied
henry
now
speak
freely
but
again
i
must
bid
you
be
i
will
be
as
brief
as
i
can
replied
the
queen
but
i
pray
you
bear
with
me
henry
if
i
unhappily
weary
you
i
am
full
of
misery
and
affliction
and
never
was
daughter
and
wife
of
king
wretched
as
i
am
pity
me
henry
pity
me
but
that
i
restrain
myself
i
should
pour
forth
my
soul
in
tears
before
you
oh
henry
after
twenty
years
duty
and
to
be
brought
to
this
unspeakable
shame
to
be
cast
from
you
with
dishonour
to
be
supplanted
by
another
it
is
terrible
if
you
have
only
come
here
to
utter
reproaches
madam
i
must
put
an
end
to
the
interview
said
henry
frowning
i
do
not
reproach
you
henry
replied
catherine
meekly
i
only
wish
to
show
you
the
depth
and
extent
of
my
affection
i
only
implore
you
to
do
me
right
and
justice
not
to
bring
shame
upon
me
to
cover
your
own
wrongful
action
have
compassion
upon
the
princess
our
daughter
spare
her
if
you
will
not
spare
me
you
sue
in
vain
catherine
replied
henry
i
lament
your
condition
but
my
eyes
are
fully
opened
to
the
sinful
state
in
which
i
have
so
long
lived
and
i
am
resolved
to
abandon
an
unworthy
prevarication
replied
catherine
by
which
you
seek
to
work
my
ruin
and
accomplish
your
union
with
anne
boleyn
and
you
will
no
doubt
succeed
for
what
can
i
a
feeble
woman
and
a
stranger
in
your
country
do
to
prevent
it
you
will
succeed
i
say
you
will
divorce
me
and
place
her
upon
the
throne
but
mark
my
words
henry
she
will
not
long
remain
the
king
smiled
bitterly
she
will
bring
dishonour
upon
you
pursued
catherine
the
woman
who
has
no
regard
for
ties
so
sacred
as
those
which
bind
us
will
not
respect
other
no
more
of
this
cried
henry
you
suffer
your
resentment
to
carry
you
too
too
far
exclaimed
catherine
too
far
is
to
warn
you
that
you
are
about
to
take
a
wanton
to
your
bed
and
that
you
will
bitterly
repent
your
folly
when
too
late
going
too
far
it
is
my
duty
henry
no
less
than
my
desire
thus
to
warn
you
ere
the
irrevocable
step
be
have
you
said
all
you
wish
to
say
madam
demanded
the
king
no
my
dear
liege
not
a
hundredth
part
of
what
my
heart
prompts
me
to
utter
replied
catherine
i
conjure
you
by
my
strong
and
tried
affection
by
the
tenderness
that
has
for
years
subsisted
between
us
by
your
hopes
of
temporal
prosperity
and
spiritual
welfare
by
all
you
hold
dear
and
sacred
to
pause
while
there
is
yet
time
let
the
legates
meet
let
them
pronounce
sentence
against
me
and
as
surely
as
those
fatal
words
are
uttered
my
heart
will
tut
tut
exclaimed
henry
impatiently
you
will
live
many
years
in
happy
i
will
die
as
i
have
lived
a
queen
replied
catherine
but
my
life
will
not
be
long
now
answer
me
truly
if
anne
boleyn
plays
you
false
she
never
will
play
me
false
interrupted
henry
i
say
if
she
does
pursued
catherine
and
you
are
satisfied
of
her
guilt
will
you
be
content
with
divorcing
her
as
you
divorce
me
no
by
my
father
head
cried
henry
fiercely
if
such
a
thing
were
to
happen
which
i
hold
impossible
she
should
expiate
her
offence
on
the
give
me
your
hand
on
that
said
catherine
i
give
you
my
hand
upon
it
he
replied
enough
said
the
queen
if
i
can
not
have
right
and
justice
i
shall
at
least
have
vengeance
though
it
will
come
when
i
am
in
my
tomb
but
it
will
come
and
that
is
this
is
the
frenzy
of
jealousy
catherine
said
henry
no
henry
it
is
not
jealousy
replied
the
queen
with
dignity
the
daughter
of
ferdinand
of
spain
and
isabella
of
castile
with
the
best
blood
of
europe
in
her
veins
would
despise
herself
if
she
could
entertain
so
paltry
a
feeling
towards
one
born
so
much
beneath
her
as
anne
as
you
will
madam
rejoined
henry
it
is
time
our
interview
not
yet
henry
for
the
love
of
heaven
not
yet
implored
catherine
oh
bethink
you
by
whom
we
were
joined
together
by
your
father
henry
the
seventh
one
of
the
wisest
princes
that
ever
sat
on
a
throne
and
by
the
sanction
of
my
own
father
ferdinand
the
fifth
one
of
the
justest
would
they
have
sanctioned
the
match
if
it
had
been
unlawful
were
they
destitute
of
good
counsellors
were
they
indifferent
to
the
future
you
had
better
reserve
these
arguments
for
the
legates
ears
tomorrow
madam
said
henry
sternly
i
shall
urge
them
there
with
all
the
force
i
can
replied
catherine
for
i
will
leave
nought
untried
to
hinder
an
event
so
fraught
with
misery
but
i
feel
the
struggle
will
be
then
why
make
it
rejoined
henry
because
it
is
due
to
you
to
myself
to
the
princess
our
daughter
to
our
illustrious
progenitors
and
to
our
people
to
make
it
replied
catherine
i
should
be
unworthy
to
be
your
consort
if
i
acted
otherwise
and
i
will
never
in
thought
word
or
deed
do
aught
derogatory
to
that
title
you
may
divorce
me
but
i
will
never
assent
to
it
you
may
wed
anne
boleyn
but
she
will
never
be
your
lawful
spouse
and
you
may
cast
me
from
your
palace
but
i
will
never
go
i
know
you
to
be
contumacious
madam
replied
henry
and
now
i
pray
you
resume
your
mask
and
withdraw
what
i
have
said
will
convince
you
that
your
stay
is
i
perceive
it
replied
catherine
farewell
henry
farewell
loved
husband
of
my
heart
farewell
for
ever
your
mask
your
mask
madam
cried
henry
impatiently
god
death
footsteps
are
approaching
lot
no
one
enter
here
he
cried
aloud
i
will
come
in
said
anne
boleyn
stepping
into
the
chapel
just
as
catherine
had
replaced
her
mask
ah
your
majesty
looks
confused
i
fear
i
have
interrupted
some
amorous
come
with
me
anne
said
henry
taking
her
arm
and
trying
to
draw
her
away
come
with
not
till
i
learn
who
your
lady
love
is
replied
anne
pettishly
you
affect
to
be
jealous
of
me
my
liege
but
i
have
much
more
reason
to
be
jealous
of
you
when
you
were
last
at
windsor
i
heard
you
paid
a
secret
visit
to
a
fair
maiden
near
the
lake
in
the
park
and
now
you
are
holding
an
interview
with
a
masked
dame
here
nay
i
care
not
for
your
gestures
of
silence
i
will
you
are
distraught
sweetheart
cried
the
king
come
no
replied
anne
lot
this
dame
be
i
shall
not
go
at
your
bidding
minion
cried
catherine
fiercely
ah
cried
anne
starting
whom
have
we
here
one
you
had
better
have
avoided
whispered
henry
the
queen
exclaimed
anne
with
a
look
of
dismay
ay
the
queen
echoed
catherine
unmasking
henry
if
you
have
any
respect
left
for
me
i
pray
you
order
this
woman
from
my
presence
lot
me
depart
in
lady
anne
i
pray
you
retire
said
henry
but
anne
stood
her

her
rashness
and
do

the
lord
percy
as
to
her
love
for

question
sir
thomas
wyat
and
a
host
of
all
these

false
and
calumnious
cried
anne
boleyn
let
the
king
inquire
and
judge
for
himself
rejoined
catherine
and
if
he
weds
you
let
him
look
well
to
you
or
you
will
make
him
a
scoff
to
all
honourable
men
and
now
as
you
have
come
between
him
and
me
as
you
have
divided
husband
and
wife
for
the
intent
whether
successful
or
not
i
denounce
you
before
heaven
and
invoke
its
wrath
upon
your
head
night
and
day
i
will
pray
that
you
may
be
brought
to
shame
and
when
i
shall
be
called
hence
as
i
maybe
soon
i
will
appear
before
the
throne
of
the
most
high
and
summon
you
to
take
me
from
her
henry
cried
anne
faintly
her
violence
affrights
no
you
shall
stay
said
catherine
grasping
her
arm
and
detaining
her
you
shall
hear
your
doom
you
imagine
your
career
will
be
a
brilliant
one
and
that
you
will
be
able
to
wield
the
sceptre
you
wrongfully
wrest
from
me
but
it
will
moulder
into
dust
in
your
hand
the
crown
unjustly
placed
upon
your
brow
will
fall
to
the
ground
and
it
will
bring
the
head
with
take
me
away
henry
i
implore
you
cried
anne
you
shall
hear
me
out
pursued
catherine
exerting
all
her
strength
and
maintaining
her
grasp
or
i
will
follow
you
down
yon
aisles
and
pour
forth
my
malediction
against
you
in
the
hearing
of
all
your
attendants
you
have
braved
me
and
shall
feel
my
power
look
at
her
henry
see
how
she
shrinks
before
the
gaze
of
an
injured
woman
look
me
in
the
face
minion
you
can
not
you
dare
not
oh
henry
sobbed
anne
you
have
brought
it
upon
yourself
said
the
king
she
has
replied
catherine
and
unless
she
pauses
and
repents
she
will
bring
yet
more
upon
her
head
you
suffer
now
minion
but
how
will
you
feel
when
in
your
turn
you
are
despised
neglected
and
supplanted
by
a
rival
when
the
false
glitter
of
your
charms
having
passed
away
henry
will
see
only
your
faults
and
will
open
his
eyes
to
all
i
now
tell
him
a
sob
was
all
the
answer
anne
could
return
you
will
feel
as
i
feel
towards
you
pursued
the
queen
hatred
towards
her
but
you
will
not
have
the
consolations
i
enjoy
you
will
have
merited
your
fate
and
you
will
then
think
upon
me
and
my
woes
and
will
bitterly
but
unavailingly
repent
your
conduct
and
now
henry
she
exclaimed
turning
solemnly
to
him
you
have
pledged
your
royal
word
to
me
and
given
me
your
hand
upon
it
that
if
you
find
this
woman
false
to
you
she
shall
expiate
her
offence
on
the
block
i
call
upon
you
to
ratify
the
pledge
in
her
i
do
so
catherine
replied
the
king
the
mere
suspicion
of
her
guilt
shall
be
henry
exclaimed
anne
i
have
said
it
replied
the
king
tremble
then
anne
boleyn
cried
catherine
tremble
and
when
you
are
adjudged
to
die
the
death
of
an
adulteress
bethink
you
of
the
prediction
of
the
queen
you
have
injured
i
may
not
live
to
witness
your
fate
but
we
shall
meet
before
the
throne
of
an
eternal
oh
henry
this
is
too
much
gasped
anne
and
she
sank
fainting
into
his
arms
begone
cried
the
king
furiously
you
have
killed
her
it
were
well
for
us
both
if
i
had
done
so
replied
catherine
but
she
will
recover
to
work
my
misery
and
her
own
to
your
hands
i
commit
her
punishment
may
god
bless
you
henry
with
this
she
replaced
her
mask
and
quitted
the
chapel
henry
meanwhile
anxious
to
avoid
the
comments
of
his
attendants
exerted
himself
to
restore
anne
boleyn
to
sensibility
and
his
efforts
were
speedily
successful
is
it
then
reality
gasped
anne
as
she
gazed
around
i
hoped
it
was
a
hideous
dream
oh
henry
this
has
been
frightful
but
you
will
not
kill
me
as
she
predicted
swear
to
me
you
will
not
why
should
you
be
alarmed
rejoined
the
king
if
you
are
faithful
you
have
nothing
to
but
you
said
suspicion
henry
you
said
suspicion
cried
anne
you
must
put
the
greater
guard
upon
your
conduct
rejoined
the
king
moodily
i
begin
to
think
there
is
some
truth
in
oh
no
i
swear
to
you
there
is
not
said
anne
i
have
trifled
with
the
gallants
of
francis
court
and
have
listened
perhaps
too
complacently
to
the
of
percy
and
wyat
but
when
your
majesty
deigned
to
cast
eyes
upon
me
all
others
vanished
as
the
stars
of
night
before
the
rising
of
the
god
of
day
henry
i
love
you
deeply
devotedly
but
catherine
terrible
imprecations
make
me
feel
more
keenly
than
i
have
ever
done
before
the
extent
of
the
wrong
i
am
about
to
inflict
upon
her
and
i
fear
that
retributive
punishment
will
follow
you
will
do
her
no
wrong
replied
henry
i
am
satisfied
of
the
justice
of
the
divorce
and
of
its
necessity
and
if
my
purposed
union
with
you
were
out
of
the
question
i
should
demand
it
be
the
fault
on
my
your
words
restore
me
in
some
measure
my
liege
said
anne
i
love
you
too
well
not
to
risk
body
and
soul
for
you
i
am
yours
for
ever
ah
she
exclaimed
with
a
fearful
look
what
ails
you
sweetheart
exclaimed
the
king
i
thought
i
saw
a
face
at
the
window
she
replied
a
black
and
hideous
face
like
that
of
a
it
was
mere
fancy
replied
the
king
your
mind
is
disturbed
by
what
has
occurred
you
had
better
join
your
attendants
and
retire
to
your
own
oh
henry
cried
anne
do
not
judge
me
unheard
do
not
believe
what
any
false
tongue
may
utter
against
me
i
love
only
you
and
can
love
only
you
i
would
not
wrong
you
even
in
thought
for
i
believe
you
sweetheart
replied
the
king
tenderly
so
saying
he
led
her
down
the
aisle
to
her
attendants
they
then
proceeded
together
to
the
royal
lodgings
where
anne
retired
to
her
own
apartments
and
henry
withdrew
to
his
private
chamber
ii
how
herne
the
hunter
appeared
to
henry
on
the
terrace
henry
again
sat
down
to
his
despatches
and
employed
himself
upon
them
to
a
late
hour
at
length
feeling
heated
and
oppressed
he
arose
and
opened
a
window
as
he
did
so
he
was
almost
blinded
by
a
vivid
flash
of
forked
lightning
ever
ready
to
court
danger
and
convinced
from
the
intense
gloom
without
that
a
fearful
storm
was
coming
on
henry
resolved
to
go
forth
to
witness
it
with
this
view
he
quitted
the
closet
and
passed
through
a
small
door
opening
on
the
northern
terrace
the
castle
clock
tolled
the
hour
of
midnight
as
he
issued
forth
and
the
darkness
was
so
profound
that
he
could
scarcely
see
a
foot
before
him
but
he
went
on
who
goes
there
cried
a
voice
as
he
advanced
and
a
partisan
was
placed
at
his
breast
the
king
replied
henry
in
tones
that
would
have
left
no
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
assertion
even
if
a
gleam
of
lightning
had
not
at
the
moment
revealed
his
figure
and
countenance
to
the
sentinel
i
did
not
look
for
your
majesty
at
such
a
time
replied
the
man
lowering
his
pike
has
your
majesty
no
apprehension
of
the
storm
i
have
watched
it
gathering
in
the
valley
and
it
will
be
a
dreadful
one
if
i
might
make
bold
to
counsel
you
i
would
advise
you
to
seek
instant
shelter
in
the
i
have
no
fear
good
fellow
laughed
the
king
get
thee
in
yon
porch
and
leave
the
terrace
to
me
i
will
warn
thee
when
i
leave
as
he
spoke
a
tremendous
peal
of
thunder
broke
overhead
and
seemed
to
shake
the
strong
pile
to
its
foundations
again
the
lightning
rent
the
black
canopy
of
heaven
in
various
places
and
shot
down
in
forked
flashes
of
the
most
dazzling
brightness
a
rack
of
clouds
heavily
charged
with
electric
fluid
hung
right
over
the
castle
and
poured
down
all
their
fires
upon
it
henry
paced
slowly
to
and
fro
utterly
indifferent
to
the
peril
he
ran
now
watching
the
lightning
as
it
shivered
some
oak
in
the
home
park
or
lighted
up
the
wide
expanse
of
country
around
him
now
listening
to
the
roar
of
heaven
artillery
and
he
had
just
quitted
the
western
extremity
of
the
terrace
when
the
most
terrific
crash
he
had
yet
heard
burst
over
him
the
next
instant
a
dozen
forked
flashes
shot
from
the
sky
while
fiery
coruscations
blazed
athwart
it
and
at
the
same
moment
a
bolt
struck
the
wykeham
tower
beside
which
he
had
been
recently
standing
startled
by
the
appalling
sound
he
turned
and
beheld
upon
the
battlemented
parapet
on
his
left
a
tall
ghostly
figure
whose
antlered
helm
told
him
it
was
herne
the
hunter
dilated
against
the
flaming
sky
the
proportions
of
the
demon
seemed
gigantic
his
right
hand
was
stretched
forth
towards
the
king
and
in
his
left
he
held
a
rusty
chain
henry
grasped
the
handle
of
his
sword
and
partly
drew
it
keeping
his
gaze
fixed
upon
the
figure
you
thought
you
had
got
rid
of
me
harry
of
england
cried
herne
but
were
you
to
lay
the
weight
of
this
vast
fabric
upon
me
i
would
break
from
under
it
ho
ho
what
wouldst
thou
infernal
spirit
cried
henry
i
am
come
to
keep
company
with
you
harry
replied
the
demon
this
is
a
night
when
only
you
and
i
should
be
abroad
we
know
how
to
enjoy
it
we
like
the
music
of
the
loud
thunder
and
the
dance
of
the
blithe
avaunt
fiend
cried
henry
i
will
hold
no
converse
with
thee
back
to
thy
native
hell
you
have
no
power
over
me
harry
rejoined
the
demon
his
words
mingling
with
the
rolling
of
the
thunder
for
your
thoughts
are
evil
and
you
are
about
to
do
an
accursed
deed
you
can
not
dismiss
me
before
the
commission
of
every
great
crime
and
many
great
crimes
you
will
commit
i
will
always
appear
to
you
and
my
last
appearance
shall
he
three
days
before
your
end
ha
ha
darest
thou
say
this
to
me
cried
henry
furiously
i
laugh
at
thy
menaces
rejoined
herne
amid
another
peal
of
thunder
but
i
have
not
yet
done
harry
of
england
your
career
shall
be
stained
in
blood
your
wrath
shall
descend
upon
the
heads
of
those
who
love
you
and
your
love
shall
be
fatal
better
anne
boleyn
fled
this
castle
and
sought
shelter
in
the
lowliest
hovel
in
the
land
than
become
your
spouse
for
you
will
slay
her
and
not
her
alone
another
shall
fall
by
your
hand
and
so
if
you
had
your
own
will
would
all
what
meanest
thou
by
all
demanded
the
king
you
will
learn
in
due
season
laughed
the
fiend
but
now
mark
me
harry
of
england
thou
fierce
and
bloody
kin
thou
shalt
be
drunken
with
the
blood
of
thy
wives
and
thy
end
shall
be
a
fearful
one
thou
shalt
linger
out
a
living
death
a
mass
of
breathing
corruption
shalt
thou
become
and
when
dead
the
very
hounds
with
which
thou
huntedst
me
shall
lick
thy
blood
these
awful
words
involving
a
fearful
prophecy
which
was
afterwards
as
will
be
shown
strangely
fulfilled
were
so
mixed
up
with
the
rolling
of
the
thunder
that
henry
could
scarcely
distinguish
one
sound
from
the
other
at
the
close
of
the
latter
speech
a
flash
of
lightning
of
such
dazzling
brilliancy
shot
down
past
him
that
he
remained
for
some
moments
almost
blinded
and
when
he
recovered
his
powers
of
vision
the
demon
had
vanished
iii
how
mabel
lyndwood
was
taken
to
the
castle
by
nicholas
clamp
and
how
they
encountered
morgan
fenwolf
by
the
way
the
storm
which
had
fallen
so
heavily
on
the
castle
had
likewise
visited
the
lake
and
alarmed
the
inmates
of
the
little
dwelling
on
its
banks
both
the
forester
and
his
were
roused
from
their
beds
and
they
sat
together
in
the
chief
apartment
of
the
cottage
listening
to
the
awful
rolling
of
the
thunder
and
watching
the
blue
flashing
of
the
lightning
the
storm
was
of
unusually
long
duration
and
continued
for
more
than
an
hour
with
unintermitted
violence
it
then
paused
the
thunder
rolled
off
and
the
flashes
of
lightning
grew
fainter
and
less
frequent
during
the
storm
mabel
continued
on
her
knees
addressing
the
most
earnest
prayers
to
the
virgin
for
her
preservation
and
that
of
her
grandfather
but
the
old
forester
though
evidently
much
alarmed
uttered
not
a
single
supplication
but
remained
sitting
in
his
chair
with
a
sullen
scared
look
as
the
thunder
died
away
he
recovered
his
composure
and
addressed
himself
to
soothe
the
fears
of
his
granddaughter
in
this
he
had
partially
succeeded
and
was
urging
her
again
to
seek
her
couch
when
the
storm
recommenced
with
fresh
fury
mabel
once
more
fell
on
her
knees
and
the
old
man
resumed
his
sullen
posture
another
dreadful
marked
by
a
succession
of
terrible
peals
and
vivid
flashes
succeeded
when
amidst
an
awful
pause
mabel
ventured
to
address
her
old
relative
why
do
you
not
pray
grandfather
she
said
regarding
him
uneasily
sister
anastasia
and
good
father
anselm
always
taught
me
to
utter
an
ave
and
cross
myself
during
a
thunderstorm
why
do
you
not
pray
grandfather
do
not
trouble
me
i
have
no
but
your
cheeks
and
lips
are
blanched
rejoined
mabel
and
i
observed
you
shudder
during
that
last
awful
crash
pray
grandfather
pray
peace
wench
and
mind
your
own
business
returned
the
old
man
angrily
the
storm
will
soon
be
over
it
can
not
last
long
in
this
the
saints
preserve
us
cried
mabel
as
a
tremendous
concussion
was
heard
overhead
followed
by
a
strong
sulphureous
smell
the
cottage
is
struck
it
is
it
is
cried
tristram
springing
to
his
feet
and
rushing
forth
for
a
few
minutes
mabel
continued
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
she
then
staggered
to
the
door
and
beheld
her
grandfather
occupied
with
two
dark
figures
whom
she
recognised
as
valentine
hagthorne
and
morgan
fenwolf
in
extinguishing
the
flames
which
were
bursting
from
the
thatched
roof
of
the
hut
surprise
and
terror
held
her
silent
and
the
others
were
so
busily
engaged
that
they
did
not
notice
her
at
last
by
their
united
efforts
the
fire
was
got
under
without
material
damage
to
the
little
building
and
mabel
retired
expecting
her
grandsire
to
return
but
as
he
did
not
do
so
and
as
almost
instantly
afterwards
the
plash
of
oars
was
heard
en
the
lake
she
flew
to
the
window
and
beheld
him
by
the
gleam
of
the
lightning
seated
in
the
skiff
with
morgan
fenwolf
while
valentine
hagthorne
had
mounted
a
black
horse
and
was
galloping
swiftly
away
mabel
saw
no
more
overcome
by
fright
she
sank
on
the
ground
insensible
when
she
recovered
the
storm
had
entirely
ceased
a
heavy
shower
had
fallen
but
the
sky
was
now
perfectly
clear
and
day
had
begun
to
dawn
mabel
went
to
the
door
of
the
hut
and
looked
forth
for
her
grandfather
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
she
remained
gazing
at
the
now
peaceful
lake
till
the
sun
had
fairly
risen
when
feeling
more
composed
she
retired
to
rest
and
sleep
which
had
been
banished
from
them
during
the
greater
part
of
the
night
now
fell
upon
her
lovely
eyelids
when
she
awoke
the
day
was
far
advanced
but
still
old
tristram
had
not
returned
and
with
a
heavy
heart
she
set
about
her
household
concerns
the
thought
however
of
her
anticipated
visit
to
the
castle
speedily
dispelled
her
anxiety
and
she
began
to
make
preparations
for
setting
out
attiring
herself
with
unusual
care
bouchier
had
not
experienced
much
difficulty
in
persuading
her
to
obey
the
king
behest
and
by
his
artful
representations
he
had
likewise
induced
her
grandfather
to
give
his
consent
to
the
visit
the
old
forester
only
stipulating
that
she
should
be
escorted
there
and
back
by
a
falconer
named
nicholas
clamp
in
whom
he
could
put
trust
to
which
proposition
bouchier
readily
assented
at
length
five
the
appointed
hour
arrived
and
with
it
came
nicholas
clamp
he
was
a
tall
man
with
yellow
hair
clipped
closely
over
his
brows
and
a
beard
and
moustaches
to
match
his
attire
resembled
that
of
a
keeper
of
the
forest
and
consisted
of
a
doublet
and
hose
of
green
cloth
but
he
did
not
carry
a
bugle
or
his
sole
weapon
was
a
stout
after
some
little
hesitation
mabel
consented
to
accompany
the
falconer
and
they
set
forth
together
the
evening
was
delightful
and
their
way
through
the
woods
was
marked
by
numberless
points
of
beauty
mabel
said
little
for
her
thoughts
were
running
upon
her
grandfather
and
upon
his
prolonged
and
mysterious
absence
but
the
falconer
talked
of
the
damage
done
by
the
thunderstorm
which
he
declared
was
the
most
awful
he
had
ever
witnessed
and
he
pointed
out
to
her
several
trees
struck
by
the
lightning
proceeding
in
this
way
they
gained
a
road
leading
from
blacknest
when
from
behind
a
large
oak
the
trunk
of
which
had
concealed
him
from
view
morgan
fenwolf
started
forth
and
planted
himself
in
their
path
the
gear
of
the
proscribed
keeper
was
wild
and
ragged
his
locks
matted
and
disordered
his
demeanour
savage
and
his
whole
appearance
forbidding
and
alarming
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
for
some
time
mabel
lyndwood
he
said
you
must
go
with
me
to
your
my
grandfather
would
never
send
you
for
me
replied
mabel
but
if
he
did
i
will
not
trust
myself
with
the
saints
preserve
us
cried
nicholas
clamp
can
i
believe
my
eyes
do
i
behold
morgan
fenwolf
come
with
me
mabel
cried
fenwolf
disregarding
him
but
she
returned
a
peremptory
refusal
she
shall
not
stir
an
inch
cried
the
falconer
it
is
thou
morgan
fenwolf
who
must
go
with
me
thou
art
a
proscribed
felon
and
thy
life
is
forfeit
to
the
king
yield
thee
dog
as
my
prisoner
thy
prisoner
echoed
fenwolf
scornfully
it
would
take
three
such
as
thou
art
to
make
me
captive
mabel
lyndwood
in
your
grandfather
name
i
command
you
to
come
with
me
and
let
nick
clamp
look
to
himself
if
he
dares
to
hinder
nick
will
do
something
more
than
hinder
her
rejoined
the
falconer
brandishing
his
staff
and
rushing
upon
the
other
felon
hound
i
command
thee
to
yield
before
the
falconer
could
reach
him
morgan
fenwolf
plucked
a
long
from
his
girdle
and
made
a
desperate
stab
at
his
assailant
but
clamp
avoided
the
blow
and
striking
fenwolf
on
the
shins
immediately
afterwards
closed
with
him
the
result
was
still
doubtful
when
the
struggle
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
trampling
of
horse
approaching
from
the
side
of
windsor
and
at
the
sound
morgan
fenwolf
disengaged
himself
from
his
antagonist
and
plunged
into
the
adjoining
wood
the
next
moment
captain
bouchier
rode
up
followed
by
a
small
band
of
halberdiers
and
receiving
information
from
the
falconer
of
what
had
occurred
darted
with
his
men
into
the
wood
in
search
of
the
fugitive
nicholas
clamp
and
his
companion
did
not
await
the
issue
of
the
search
but
proceeded
on
their
way
as
they
walked
at
a
brisk
pace
they
reached
the
long
avenue
in
about
and
took
their
way
down
it
when
within
a
mile
of
the
castle
they
were
overtaken
by
bouchier
and
his
followers
and
the
falconer
was
much
disappointed
to
learn
that
they
had
failed
in
tracking
morgan
fenwolf
to
his
lair
after
addressing
a
few
complimentary
words
to
the
maiden
bouchier
rode
on
soon
after
this
the
pair
quitted
the
great
park
and
passing
through
a
row
of
straggling
houses
divided
by
gardens
and
closes
which
skirted
the
foot
of
castle
hill
presently
reached
the
lower
gate
they
were
admitted
without
difficulty
but
just
as
they
entered
the
lower
ward
the
falconer
was
hailed
by
shoreditch
and
paddington
who
at
the
moment
issued
from
the
doorway
of
the
clamp
obeyed
the
call
and
went
towards
them
and
it
was
evident
from
the
gestures
of
the
archers
that
they
were
making
inquiries
about
mabel
whose
appearance
seemed
to
interest
them
greatly
after
a
brief
conversation
with
the
falconer
they
approached
her
and
respectfully
addressing
her
begged
leave
to
attend
her
to
the
royal
lodgings
whither
they
understood
she
was
going
no
objection
being
made
to
the
proposal
by
mabel
the
party
directed
their
course
towards
the
middle
ward
passing
through
the
gateway
of
the
norman
tower
they
stopped
before
a
low
portal
in
a
picturesque
gothic
wing
of
the
castle
with
projecting
walls
and
which
had
been
erected
in
the
preceding
reign
of
henry
the
seventh
and
was
consequently
still
in
all
its
freshness
and
beauty
iv
how
mabel
was
received
by
the
party
in
the
kitchen
and
of
the
quarrel
between
the
two
jesters
addressing
himself
to
a
yeoman
of
the
guard
who
was
standing
within
the
doorway
nicholas
clamp
demanded
admittance
to
the
kitchen
and
the
man
having
detained
them
for
a
few
moments
during
which
he
regarded
mabel
with
a
very
offensive
stare
ushered
them
into
a
small
hall
and
from
thence
into
a
narrow
passage
connected
with
it
lighted
by
narrow
loopholes
pierced
through
the
walls
which
were
of
immense
thickness
this
passage
described
the
outer
side
of
the
whole
upper
quadrangle
and
communicated
with
many
other
lateral
passages
and
winding
stairs
leading
to
the
chambers
allotted
to
the
household
or
to
the
state
apartments
tracking
it
for
some
time
nicholas
clamp
at
length
turned
off
on
the
right
and
crossing
a
sort
of
led
the
way
into
a
large
chamber
with
stone
walls
and
a
coved
and
groined
roof
lighted
by
a
great
window
at
the
lower
end
this
was
the
royal
kitchen
and
in
it
yawned
no
fewer
than
seven
huge
arched
fireplaces
in
which
fires
were
burning
and
before
which
various
goodly
joints
were
being
roasted
while
a
number
of
cooks
and
scullions
were
congregated
round
them
at
a
large
table
in
the
centre
of
the
kitchen
were
seated
some
yeomen
of
the
guard
together
with
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
the
chief
bargeman
and
the
royal
cutler
or
bladesmith
as
he
was
termed
these
worthies
were
doing
ample
justice
to
a
chine
of
beef
a
pie
a
couple
of
fat
capons
a
peacock
pasty
a
mess
of
pickled
lobsters
and
other
excellent
and
inviting
dishes
with
which
the
board
was
loaded
neither
did
they
neglect
to
wash
down
the
viands
with
copious
draughts
of
ale
and
mead
from
great
pots
and
flagons
placed
beside
them
behind
this
party
stood
giovanni
joungevello
an
italian
minstrel
much
in
favour
with
anne
boleyn
and
domingo
lamellino
or
lamelyn
as
he
was
familiarly
termed
a
lombard
who
pretended
to
some
knowledge
of
chirurgery
astrology
and
alchemy
and
who
was
a
constant
attendant
on
henry

the
head
of
the
bench
on
the
right
of
the
table

will
sommers
the
jester
was
not
partaking
of
the
repast
but
was
chatting
with
simon

the
chief
cook
a
personage
as
a
tun
and
blessed
with
a
spouse
yclept
deborah
as
fond
of
good
cheer
as
fat
and
as
as
himself
behind
the
cook
stood
the
cellarman
known
by
the
appellation
of
jack
of
the
bottles
and
at
his
feet
were
two
playful
little
turnspits
with
long
backs
and
short
forelegs
as
crooked
almost
as
sickles
on
seeing
mabel
will
sommers
immediately
arose
and
advancing
towards
her
with
a
mincing
step
bowed
with
an
air
of
mock
ceremony
and
said
in
an
affected
tone

king
kitchen

the

the
bargeman

as

pointing
to
the
two
they
are
special
favourites
of
the
king
highness
they
are
much
attached
to
the
cook
their
master
but
their
chief
love
is
towards
each
other
and
nothing

and
then
he
will
take
his
place
they
always
eat
out
of
the
same
platter
and
drink
out
of
the
same
cup
i
once
separated
them
for
a
few
hours
to
see
what
would
happen
but
they
howled
so
piteously
that
i
was
forced
to
bring
them
together
again
it
would
have
done
your
heart
good
to
witness
their
meeting
and
to
see
how
they
leaped
and
rolled
with
delight

the
nearest
turnspit

the
cake
in
his
mouth
and
proceeding
towards
nob
broke
it
into
two
pieces
and
pushed
the
larger
portion
towards
him
while
mabel
was
admiring
this
display
of
sagacity
and
affection
a
bustling
step
was
heard
behind
her
and
turning
she
beheld
a
strange
figure
in
a
gown
and
hose
with
a
fool
cap
and
bells
on
his
head
whom
she
immediately
recognised
as
the
cardinal

by
curiosity
the
whole
of
the
party
rose
from
the
table
simon
quanden
got
out
of
his
chair
the
other
cooks
left
their
joints
to
scorch
at
the
fire
the
scullions
suspended
their
work
and
hob
and
nob
fixed
their
large
inquiring
black
eyes
upon
the
jester
i
never
talk
thirsting
said
patch
marching
to
the
table
and
filling
himself
a
flagon
of
mead
here
to
you
fair
maiden
he
added
kissing
the
cup
to
mabel
and
swallowing
its
contents
at
a
draught
and
now
be
seated
my
masters
and
you

and
it
will
be

a
few
words
the
court

adjourned
for

days
queen
catherine
having
demanded
that
time
to

her
allegations
and
the
delay

granted
pest
on
it
the
delay
is
some
trick
of
your
crafty
and
master
cried
will
sommers

i
the
king
i
know
how
i
would
deal
with
what
wouldst
thou
do
thou
scurril
knave
cried
patch
angrily
i
would
strip
him
of
his
wealth
and
leave
him
only
thee
a
fitting
attendant
of
all
his
thousand
servitors
replied
will
this
shall
to
his
grace
ears
screamed
patch
amid
the
laughter
of
the
company
and
see
whether
your
back
does
not
smart
for
i
fear
him
not
replied
will
sommers
i
have
not

told
the
king
my
master
of
the
rare
wine
we
found
in
his
what
wine
was
that
will
cried
jack
of
the
bottles
you
shall
hear
replied
will
sommers
enjoying
the
disconcerted
look
of
the
other
jester
i
was
at
the
palace
at
hampton
when
this
knave
invited
me
to
taste
some
of
his
master
wine
and
accordingly
to
the
cellar
we
went
wine
will
surprise
you
quoth
he
as
we
broached
the
first
hogshead
and
truly
it
did
surprise
me
for
no
wine
followed
the
gimlet
so
we
went
on
to
another
and
another
and
another
till
we
tried
half
a
score
of
them
and
all
with
the
same
result
upon
this
i
seized
a
hammer
which
was
lying
by
and
sounded
the
casks
but
none
of
them
seeming
empty
i
at
last
broke
the
lid
of
one
and
what
do
you
think
it
contained
a
variety
of
responses
were
returned
by
the
laughing
assemblage
during
which
patch
sought
to
impose
silence
upon
his
opponent
but
will
sommers
was
not
to
be
checked
it
contained
neither
vinegar
nor
oil
nor
lead
he
said
but
gold
ay
solid
bars
of
every
hogshead
was
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
and
credit
him
not
my
masters
cried
patch
amid
the
roars
of
the
company
the
whole
is
a
mere
fable
an
invention
his
grace
has
no
such
treasure
the
truth
is
will
sommers
got
drunk
upon
some
choice
malmsey
and
then
dreamed
he
had
been
broaching
casks
of
it
is
no
fable
as
you
and
your
master
will
find
when
the
king
comes
to
sift
the
matter
replied
will
this
will
be
a
richer
result
to
him
than
was
ever
produced
by
your
alchemical
experiments
good
signor
domingo
it
is
false
i
say
false
screamed
patch
let
the
cellars
be
searched
and
i
will
stake
my
head
nothing
is
stake
thy
cap
and
there
may
be
some
meaning
in
it
said
will
plucking
patch
cap
from
his
head
and
elevating
it
on
his
truncheon
here
is
an
emblem
of
the
cardinal
of
york
he
cried
pointing
to
it
a
roar
of
laughter
from
the
company
followed
this
sally
and
hob
and
nob
looked
up
in
placid
wonderment
i
shall
die
with
laughing
cried
simon
quanden
holding
his
fat
sides
and
addressing
his
spouse
who
was
leaning
upon
his
shoulder
in
the
meantime
patch
sprang
to
his
feet
and
gesticulating
with
rage
and
fury
cried
thou
hast
done
well
to
steal
my
cap
and
bells
for
they
belong
of
right
to
thee
add
my
folly
to
thy
own
and
thou
wilt
be
a
fitting
servant
to
thy
master
or
give
him
the
cap
and
then
there
will
be
a
pair
of
who
is
the
fool
now
i
should
like
to
know
rejoined
will
sommers
gravely
i
call
you
all
to
witness
that
he
has
spoken
while
this
was
passing
shoreditch
had
advanced
with
a
flagon
of
malmsey
to
mabel
but
she
was
so
interested
in
the
quarrel
between
the
two
jesters
that
she
heeded
him
not
neither
did
she
attend
to
nicholas
clamp
who
was
trying
to
explain
to
her
what
was
going
forward
but
just
as
patch
indiscreet
speech
was
uttered
an
usher
entered
the
kitchen
and
announced
the
approach
of
the
king
of
the
combat
between
will
sommers
and
patch
and
how
it
terminated
mabel
heart
fluttered
violently
at
the
usher
announcement
and
for
a
moment
the
colour
deserted
her
cheek
while
the
next
instant
she
was
covered
with
blushes
as
to
poor
patch
feeling
that
his
indiscretion
might
place
him
in
great
jeopardy
and
seriously
affect
his
master
to
whom
he
was
devotedly
attached
he
cast
a
piteous
and
imploring
look
at
his
antagonist
but
was
answered
only
by
a
derisive
laugh
coupled
with
an
expressive
gesture
to
intimate
that
a
halter
would
be
his
fate
fearful
that
mischief
might
ensue
the
simon
quanden
got
out
of
his
chair
and
earnestly
besought
will
not
to
carry
matters
too
far
but
the
jester
remained
implacable
it
was
not
unusual
with
henry
to
visit
the
different
offices
of
the
castle
and
converse
freely
and
familiarly
with
the
members
of
his
household
but
it
was
by
no
means
safe
to
trust
to
the
continuance
of
his
good
humour
or
in
the
slightest
degree
to
presume
upon
it
it
is
well
known
that
his
taste
for
variety
of
character
often
led
him
like
the
renowned
caliph
haroun
al
raschid
to
mix
with
the
lower
classes
of
his
subjects
in
disguise
at
which
times
many
extraordinary
adventures
are
said
to
have
befallen
him
his
present
visit
to
the
kitchen
therefore
would
have
occasioned
no
surprise
to
its
occupants
if
it
had
not
occurred
so
soon
after
the
cardinal
arrival
but
it
was
this
circumstance
in
fact
that
sent
him
thither
the
intelligence
brought
by
wolsey
of
the
adjournment
of
the
court
for
three
days
under
the
plea
of
giving
the
queen
time
for
her
allegations
was
so
unlooked
for
by
henry
that
he
quitted
the
cardinal
in
high
displeasure
and
was
about
to
repair
to
anne
boleyn
when
he
encountered
bouchier
who
told
him
that
mabel
lyndwood
had
been
brought
to
the
castle
and
her
grandsire
arrested
the
information
changed
henry
intentions
at
once
and
he
proceeded
with
bouchier
and
some
other
attendants
to
the
kitchen
where
he
was
given
to
understand
he
should
find
the
damsel
many
a
furtive
glance
was
thrown
at
the
king
for
no
one
dared
openly
to
regard
him
as
he
approached
the
forester
fair
granddaughter
but
he
tarried
only
a
moment
beside
her
chucked
her
under
the
chin
and
whispering
a
word
or
two
in
her
ear
that
heightened
her
blushes
passed
on
to
the
spot
where
the
two
jesters
were
standing
what
dost
thou
here
knave
he
said
to
will
sommers
i
might
rather
ask
that
question
of
your
majesty
replied
will
and
i
would
do
so
but
that
i
require
not
to
be
i
have
come
to
see
what
passeth
in
my
household
replied
the
king
throwing
himself
into
the
chair
lately
occupied
by
the
chief
cook
ah
hob
and
nob
my
merry
rascals
he
cried
patting
the
turnspits
who
ran
towards
him
and
thrust
their
noses
against
his
hand
ye
are
as
gamesome
and
loving
as
ever
i
see
give
me
a
manchet
for
them
master
cook
and
let
not
the
proceedings
in
the
kitchen
be
stayed
for
my
presence
i
would
not
have
my
supper
delayed
or
the
roasts
spoiled
for
any
false
ceremony
and
now
will
what
hast
thou
to
say
that
thou
lookest
so
hard
at
me
i
have
a
heavy
charge
to
bring
against
this
knave
an
please
your
majesty
replied
will
sommers
pointing
to
patch
what
hath
he
retorted
upon
thee
too
sharply
replied
the
king
laughing
if
so
challenge
him
to
the
combat
and
settle
the
grievance
with
thy
lathen
dagger
but
refer
not
the
matter
to
me
i
am
no
judge
in
fools
your
own
excepted
muttered
will
this
is
not
a
quarrel
that
can
be
so
adjusted
he
added
aloud
i
charge
this
rascal
patch
with
speaking
disrespectfully
of
your
highness
in
the
hearing
of
the
whole
kitchen
and
i
also
charge
his
master
the
cardinal
with
having
secreted
in
his
cellars
at
hampton
a
vast
amount
of
treasure
obtained
by
extortion
privy
dealings
with
foreign
powers
and
other
iniquitous
practices
and
which
ought
of
right
to
find
its
way
to
your
royal
which
shall
find
its
way
thither
if
thou
dost
not
avouch
a
fable
replied
the
king
your
majesty
shall
judge
rejoined
will
and
he
repeated
the
story
which
he
had
just
before
related
can
this
be
true
exclaimed
henry
at
its
close
it
is
false
your
highness
every
word
of
it
cried
patch
throwing
himself
at
the
king
feet
except
so
far
as
relates
to
our
visits
to
the
cellar
where
i
shame
to
speak
it
we
drank
so
much
that
our
senses
clean
forsook
us
as
to
my
indiscreet
speech
touching
your
majesty
neither
disrespect
nor
disloyalty
were
intended
by
it
i
was
goaded
to
the
rejoinder
by
the
sharp
sting
of
this
the
matter
of
the
treasure
shall
be
inquired
into
without
delay
said
henry
as
to
the
quarrel
it
shall
be
settled
thus
get
both
of
you
upon
that
table
a
shall
be
given
to
each
and
he
who
is
first
knocked
off
shall
be
held
the
king
judgment
was
received
with
as
much
applause
as
dared
be
exhibited
by
the
hearers
and
in
an
instant
the
board
was
cleared
and
a
couple
of
partly
filled
delivered
to
the
combatants
by
simon
quanden
who
bestirred
himself
with
unwonted
activity
on
the
occasion
leaping
upon
the
table
amid
the
smothered
mirth
of
the
assemblage
the
two
jesters
placed
themselves
opposite
each
other
and
grinned
such
comical
defiance
that
the
king
roared
with
laughter
after
a
variety
of
odd
movements
and
feints
on
either
side
patch
tried
to
bring
down
his
adversary
by
a
tremendous
blow
but
in
dealing
it
the
weight
of
the
hag
dragged
him
forward
and
pitched
him
head
foremost
upon
the
floor
as
it
was
he
fell
on
his
face
upon
the
table
and
in
this
position
received
several
heavy
blows
upon
the
prominent
part
of
his
back
from
will
sommers
ere
long
however
he
managed
to
regain
his
legs
and
smarting
with
pain
attacked
his
opponent
furiously
in
his
turn
for
a
short
space
fortune
seemed
to
favour
him
his
bag
had
slightly
burst
and
the
flour
showering
from
it
with
every
blow
blinded
his
adversary
whom
he
drove
to
the
very
edge
of
the
table
at
this
critical
juncture
will
managed
to
bring
down
his
bag
full
upon
his
opponent
sconce
and
the
force
of
the
blow
bursting
it
patch
was
covered
from
crown
to
foot
with
flour
and
blinded
in
his
turn
the
appearance
of
the
combatants
was
now
so
exquisitely
ridiculous
that
the
king
leaned
back
in
his
chair
to
indulge
his
laughter
and
the
mirth
of
the
spectators
could
no
longer
be
kept
within
decorous
limits
the
very
turnspits
barked
in
laughing
concert
well
fought
on
both
sides
cried
henry
it
were
hard
to
say
which
will
prove
the
victor
now
knaves
to
it
again
ha
ha
to
it
again
once
more
the
bags
were
wielded
descended
and
the
blows
were
so
well
directed
on
either
side
that
both
combatants
fell
backwards
again
the
king
laughter
rose
loud
and
long
again
the
merriment
of
the
other
beholders
was
redoubled
again
hob
and
nob
barked
joyously
and
tried
to
spring
on
to
the
table
to
take
part
in
the
conflict
amid
the
general
glee
the
combatants
rose
and
renewed
the
fight
dealing
blows
thick
and
fast
for
the
bags
were
now
considerably
lightened
of
their
contents
until
they
were
completely
hidden
from
view
by
a
cloud
of
white
dust
we
can
not
see
the
fray
remarked
henry
but
we
can
hear
the
din
of
battle
which
will
prove
the
victor
i
marvel
i
am
for
will
sommers
cried
bouchier
and
i
for
patch
said
simon
quanden
latterly
he
hath
seemed
to
me
to
have
the
it
is
decided
cried
the
king
rising
as
one
of
the
combatants
was
knocked
off
the
table
and
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
great
noise
who
is
it
patch
replied
a
faint
voice
and
through
the
cloud
of
dust
struggled
forth
the
forlorn
figure
of
the
cardinal
jester
while
will
sommers
leaped
triumphantly
to
the
ground
get
thee
to
a
knave
and
cleanse
thyself
said
henry
laughing
in
consideration
of
the
punishment
thou
hast
undergone
i
pardon
thee
thy
treasonable
so
saying
he
rose
and
walked
towards
mabel
who
had
been
quite
as
much
alarmed
as
amused
by
the
scene
which
had
just
taken
place
i
hope
you
have
been
as
well
cared
for
damsel
he
said
since
your
arrival
at
the
castle
as
you
cared
for
the
duke
of
suffolk
and
myself
when
we
visited
your
cottage
i
have
had
everything
i
require
my
liege
replied
mabel
timidly
dame
quanden
will
take
charge
of
you
till
rejoined
the
king
when
you
will
enter
upon
the
service
of
one
of
our
your
majesty
is
very
considerate
said
mabel
but
i
would
rather
go
back
at
early
dawn
to
my
that
is
needless
rejoined
the
king
sternly
your
grandsire
is
in
the
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
exclaimed
mabel
and
then
altering
her
tone
for
she
did
not
like
the
expression
of
the
king
countenance
she
added
i
hope
he
has
not
incurred
your
majesty
i
trust
he
will
be
able
to
clear
himself
mabel
said
henry
but
he
labours
under
the
grave
suspicion
of
leaguing
with
lawless
mabel
shuddered
for
the
thought
of
what
she
had
witnessed
on
the
previous
night
during
the
storm
rushed
forcibly
to
her
recollection
the
king
noticed
her
uneasiness
and
added
in
a
gentler
tone
if
he
makes
such
confession
as
will
bring
the
others
to
justice
he
has
nothing
to
fear
dame
quanden
i
commit
this
maiden
to
your
charge
she
will
take
her
place
as
attendant
to
the
lady
elizabeth
so
saying
he
moved
off
with
bouchier
and
the
rest
of
his
attendants
leaving
mabel
to
the
care
of
the
cook
good
humoured
spouse
who
seeing
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
strove
to
cheer
her
and
led
her
towards
a
small
where
she
pressed
wine
and
cates
upon
her
be
of
good
cheer
sweetheart
she
said
in
a
soothing
tone
no
harm
will
befall
your
grandfather
you
are
much
too
high
in
favour
with
the
king
for
i
liked
the
king
much
better
as
i
saw
him
at
our
cottage
good
dame
replied
mabel
smiling
through
her
tears
in
the
guise
of
a
guildford
merchant
he
seemed
scarcely
to
notice
me
just
that
was
because
so
many
eyes
were
upon
you
replied
deborah
but
sooth
to
say
i
should
be
better
pleased
if
he
did
not
notice
you
at
mabel
blushed
and
hung
her
head
i
am
glad
you
are
to
be
an
attendant
on
the
lady
fitzgerald
pursued
deborah
for
she
is
the
fairest
young
lady
at
court
and
as
good
and
gentle
as
she
is
fair
and
i
am
sure
you
will
find
her
a
kind
mistress
i
will
tell
you
something
about
her
she
is
beloved
by
the
king
son
the
duke
of
richmond
but
she
requites
not
his
passion
for
her
heart
is
fixed
on
the
youthful
earl
of
surrey
the
noble
rivals
quarrelled
and
crossed
swords
about
her
but
as
luck
would
have
it
they
were
separated
before
any
mischief
was
done
the
king
was
very
wroth
with
lord
surrey
and
ordered
him
to
be
imprisoned
for
two
months
in
the
round
tower
in
this
castle
where
he
is
now
though
his
term
has
very
nearly
how
i
pity
him
to
be
thus
harshly
treated
remarked
mabel
her
eyes
swimming
with
tears
and
the
lady
elizabeth
too
i
shall
delight
to
serve
i
am
told
the
earl
passes
the
whole
of
his
time
in
poring
over
books
and
writing
and
sonnets
said
deborah
it
seems
strange
that
one
so
young
should
be
a
poet
but
i
suppose
he
caught
the
art
from
his
friend
sir
thomas
is
he
a
friend
of
sir
thomas
wyat
asked
mabel
quickly
his
close
friend
replied
deborah
except
the
duke
of
richmond
now
his
rival
he
had
none
closer
have
you
ever
seen
sir
thomas
sweetheart
yes
for
a
few
moments
replied
mabel
confusedly
i
heard
that
he
lingered
for
a
short
time
in
the
forest
before
his
departure
for
paris
said
dame
quanden
there
was
a
strange
rumour
that
he
had
joined
the
band
of
herne
the
hunter
but
that
must
have
been
is
he
returned
from
france
inquired
mabel
without
heeding
the
remark
i
fancy
not
replied
the
good
dame
at
all
events
he
is
not
come
to
the
castle
know
you
not
she
added
in
a
low
confidential
tone
that
the
king
is
jealous
of
him
he
was
a
former
suitor
to
the
lady
anne
boleyn
and
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
it
is
supposed
that
his
mission
to
france
was
only
a
pretext
to
get
him
out
of
the
i
suspected
as
much
replied
mabel
alas
for
sir
thomas
and
alas
for
the
earl
of
and
alas
for
mabel
lyndwood
if
she
allows
her
heart
to
be
fixed
upon
the
king
said
deborah
while
this
was
passing
the
business
of
the
kitchen
which
had
been
interrupted
by
the
various
incidents
above
related
and
especially
by
the
conflict
between
the
two
jesters
was
hurried
forward
and
for
some
time
all
was
bustle
and
confusion
but
as
soon
as
the
supper
was
served
and
all
his
duties
were
fully
discharged
simon
quanden
who
had
been
bustling
about
sat
down
in
his
and
recruited
himself
with
a
toast
and
a
sack
posset
hob
and
nob
had
their
supper
at
the
same
time
and
the
party
at
the
table
which
had
been
increased
by
the
two
archers
and
nicholas
clamp
attacked
with
renewed
vigour
a
fresh
supply
of
mead
and
ale
which
had
been
provided
for
them
by
jack
of
the
bottles
the
conversation
then
turned
upon
herne
the
hunter
and
as
all
had
heard
more
or
less
about
him
and
some
had
seen
him
while
few
knew
the
legend
connected
with
him
hector
cutbeard
volunteered
to
relate
it
upon
which
all
the
party
gathered
closer
together
and
mabel
and
deborah
left
off
talking
and
drew
near
to
listen
vi
the
legend
of
herne
the
hunter
nearly
a
century
and
a
half
ago
commenced
cutbeard
about
the
middle
of
the
reign
of
richard
the
second
there
was
among
the
keepers
of
the
forest
a
young
man
named
herne
he
was
expert
beyond
his
fellows
in
all
matters
of
woodcraft
and
consequently
in
great
favour
with
the
king
who
was
himself
devoted
to
the
chase
whenever
he
stayed
at
the
castle
king
richard
like
our
own
royal
harry
would
pass
his
time
in
hunting
hawking
or
shooting
with
the
and
on
all
these
occasions
the
young
keeper
was
his
constant
attendant
if
a
hart
was
to
be
chased
herne
and
his
two
black
hounds
of
saint
hubert
breed
would
hunt
him
down
with
marvellous
speed
if
a
wild
boar
was
to
be
reared
a
badger
digged
out
a
fox
unkennelled
a
marten
bayed
or
an
otter
vented
herne
was
chosen
for
the
task
no
one
could
fly
a
falcon
so
well
as
herne
no
one
could
break
up
a
deer
so
quickly
or
so
skilfully
as
him
but
in
proportion
as
he
grew
in
favour
with
the
king
the
young
keeper
was
hated
by
his
comrades
and
they
concerted
together
how
to
ruin
him
all
their
efforts
however
were
ineffectual
and
rather
tended
to
his
advantage
than
injury
one
day
it
chanced
that
the
king
hunted
in
the
forest
with
his
favourite
the
earl
of
oxford
when
a
great
deer
of
head
was
unharboured
and
a
tremendous
chase
ensued
the
hart
leading
his
pursuers
within
a
few
miles
of
hungerford
whither
the
borders
of
the
forest
then
extended
all
the
followers
of
the
king
even
the
earl
of
oxford
had
by
this
time
dropped
off
and
the
royal
huntsman
was
only
attended
by
herne
who
kept
close
behind
him
at
last
the
hart
driven
to
desperation
stood
at
bay
and
gored
the
king
horse
as
he
came
up
in
such
a
manner
that
it
reared
and
threw
its
rider
another
instant
and
the
horns
of
the
infuriated
animal
would
have
been
plunged
into
the
body
of
the
king
if
herne
had
not
flung
himself
between
the
prostrate
monarch
and
his
assailant
and
received
the
stroke
intended
for
him
though
desperately
wounded
the
young
hunter
contrived
slightly
to
raise
himself
and
plunged
his
knife
into
the
hart
throat
while
the
king
regained
his
feet
gazing
with
the
utmost
concern
at
his
unfortunate
deliverer
king
richard
demanded
what
he
could
do
for
him
sire
nothing
replied
herne
with
a
groan
i
shall
require
nothing
but
a
grave
from
you
for
i
have
received
a
wound
that
will
speedily
bring
me
to
it
so
i
trust
good
fellow
replied
the
king
in
a
tone
meant
to
be
encouraging
though
his
looks
showed
that
his
heart
misgave
him
best
leech
shall
attend
you
skill
will
avail
me
now
replied
herne
sadly
hurt
from
horn
bringeth
to
the
bier
hope
the
proverb
will
not
be
justified
in
thy
case
rejoined
the
king
i
promise
thee
if
thou
dost
recover
thou
shalt
have
the
post
of
head
keeper
of
the
forest
with
twenty
nobles
a
year
for
wages
if
unhappily
thy
forebodings
are
realised
i
will
give
the
same
sum
to
be
laid
out
in
masses
for
thy
soul
humbly
thank
your
highness
replied
the
young
man
i
accept
the
latter
offer
seeing
it
is
the
only
one
likely
to
profit
me
with
this
he
put
his
horn
to
his
lips
and
winding
the
dead
mot
feebly
fell
back
senseless
much
moved
the
king
rode
off
for
succour
and
blowing
a
lusty
call
on
his
bugle
was
presently
joined
by
the
earl
of
oxford
and
some
of
his
followers
among
whom
were
the
keepers
the
latter
were
secretly
rejoiced
on
hearing
what
had
befallen
herne
but
they
feigned
the
greatest
affliction
and
hastened
with
the
king
to
the
spot
where
the
body
was
lying
stretched
out
beside
that
of
the
hart
is
almost
a
pity
his
soul
can
not
pass
away
thus
said
king
richard
gazing
compassionately
at
him
he
will
only
revive
to
anguish
and
speedy
death
highness
is
right
replied
the
chief
keeper
a
grim
old
man
named
osmond
crooke
kneeling
beside
him
and
half
drawing
his
were
better
to
put
him
out
of
his
misery
slay
the
man
who
has
just
saved
my
own
life
cried
the
king
will
consent
to
no
such
infamous
deed
i
would
give
a
large
reward
to
any
one
who
could
cure
him
as
the
words
were
uttered
a
tall
dark
man
in
a
strange
garb
and
mounted
on
a
black
steed
whom
no
one
had
hitherto
observed
sprang
to
the
ground
and
advanced
towards
the
king
take
your
offer
sire
said
this
personage
in
a
harsh
voice
i
will
cure
him
art
thou
fellow
demanded
king
richard
doubtfully
am
a
forester
replied
the
tall
man
i
understand
somewhat
of
chirurgery
and
leechcraft
woodcraft
too
i
be
sworn
fellow
said
the
king
hast
or
i
am
mistaken
made
free
with
some
of
my
venison
looks
marvellously
like
arnold
sheafe
who
was
outlawed
for
said
osmond
crooke
regarding
him
steadfastly
am
no
outlaw
neither
am
i
called
arnold
sheafe
replied
the
other
name
is
philip
urswick
and
i
can
render
a
good
account
of
myself
when
it
shall
please
the
king
highness
to
interrogate
me
i
dwell
on
the
heath
near
bagshot
which
you
passed
today
in
the
chase
and
where
i
joined
you
noted
you
not
said
osmond
i
nor
i
cried
the
other
keepers
may
be
but
i
saw
you
rejoined
urswick
contemptuously
i
tell
you
there
is
not
one
among
you
to
be
compared
with
the
brave
hunter
who
lies
there
you
have
all
pronounced
his
case
hopeless
i
repeat
i
can
cure
him
if
the
king
will
make
it
worth
my
while
good
thy
words
fellow
replied
the
king
thou
shalt
not
only
be
amply
rewarded
but
shalt
have
a
free
pardon
for
any
offence
thou
mayest
have
committed
replied
urswick
and
taking
a
large
from
his
girdle
he
cut
off
the
head
of
the
hart
close
to
the
point
where
the
neck
joins
the
skull
and
then
laid
it
open
from
the
extremity
of
the
to
the
nuke
must
be
bound
on
the
head
of
the
wounded
man
he
said
the
keepers
stared
in
astonishment
but
the
king
commanded
that
the
strange
order
should
be
obeyed
upon
which
the
bleeding
skull
was
fastened
upon
the
head
of
the
keeper
with
leathern
thongs
will
now
answer
for
his
perfect
cure
in
a
month
time
said
urswick
to
the
king
i
shall
require
to
watch
over
him
myself
till
all
danger
is
at
an
end
i
pray
your
highness
to
command
these
keepers
to
transport
him
to
my
hut
hear
what
he
says
knaves
cried
the
king
his
bidding
and
carefully
or
ye
shall
answer
to
me
with
your
lives
accordingly
a
litter
was
formed
with
branches
of
trees
and
on
this
the
body
of
herne
with
the
hart
head
still
bound
to
it
was
conveyed
by
the
keepers
to
urswick
hut
a
small
dwelling
situated
in
the
wildest
part
of
bagshot
heath
after
placing
the
body
upon
a
bed
of
dried
fern
the
keepers
were
about
to
depart
when
osmond
crooke
observed
to
the
forester
am
now
certain
thou
art
arnold
sheafe
matters
not
who
i
am
since
i
have
the
king
pardon
replied
the
other
laughing
disdainfully
hast
yet
to
earn
it
said
osmond
that
to
me
replied
urswick
is
more
fear
that
thou
wilt
lose
thy
post
as
chief
keeper
which
the
king
has
promised
to
herne
than
that
i
shall
fail
the
deer
had
killed
him
outright
growled
osmond
and
the
savage
wish
was
echoed
by
the
other
keepers
see
you
all
hate
him
bitterly
said
urswick
will
you
give
me
for
revenge
have
little
to
give
save
a
fat
buck
on
occasions
replied
osmond
in
all
likelihood
thou
canst
help
thyself
to
venison
you
swear
to
grant
the
first
request
i
may
make
of
you
provided
it
shall
be
in
your
power
demanded
urswick
they
replied
said
urswick
must
keep
faith
with
the
king
herne
will
recover
but
he
will
lose
all
his
skill
as
an
archer
all
his
craft
as
a
hunter
thou
canst
accomplish
this
thou
art
the
fiend
himself
cried
osmond
trembling
or
not
replied
urswick
with
a
triumphant
laugh
have
made
a
compact
with
me
and
must
fulfil
it
now
begone
i
must
attend
to
the
wounded
man
and
the
keepers
full
of
secret
misgiving
departed
at
the
precise
time
promised
herne
attended
by
urswick
presented
himself
to
the
king
he
looked
thin
and
pale
but
all
danger
was
past
king
richard
gave
the
forester
a
purse
full
of
nobles
and
added
a
silver
bugle
to
the
gift
he
then
appointed
herne
his
chief
keeper
hung
a
chain
of
gold
round
his
neck
and
ordered
him
to
be
lodged
in
the
castle
about
a
week
after
this
herne
having
entirely
regained
his
strength
accompanied
the
king
on
a
hunting
expedition
to
the
forest
and
they
had
scarcely
entered
it
when
his
horse
started
and
threw
him
up
to
that
moment
such
an
accident
had
never
happened
to
him
for
he
was
an
excellent
horseman
and
he
arose
greatly
discomfited
while
the
keepers
eyed
each
other
askance
soon
after
this
a
buck
was
started
and
though
herne
was
bravely
mounted
on
a
black
steed
bestowed
on
him
on
account
of
its
swiftness
by
the
king
he
was
the
last
in
the
chase
art
out
of
practice
said
the
king
laughing
as
he
came
up
know
not
what
ails
me
replied
herne
gloomily
can
not
be
thy
steed
fault
said
the
king
he
is
usually
as
fleet
as
the
wind
but
i
will
give
thee
an
opportunity
of
gaining
credit
in
another
way
thou
seest
yon
buck
he
can
not
be
seventy
yards
off
and
i
have
seen
thee
hit
the
mark
at
twice
the
distance
bring
him
down
herne
raised
his
crossbow
and
let
fly
the
bolt
but
it
missed
its
mark
and
the
buck
startled
by
the
noise
dashed
down
the
brake
wholly
uninjured
king
richard
brow
grew
dark
and
herne
uttered
an
exclamation
of
rage
and
despair
shalt
have
a
third
and
yet
easier
trial
said
the
king
old
osmond
crooke
shall
lend
thee
his
bow
and
thy
quarry
shall
be
yon
as
he
spoke
the
arrow
sped
but
it
quivered
in
the
trunk
of
the
tree
some
yards
from
the
bird
the
unfortunate
shooter
looked
distracted
but
king
richard
made
no
remark
until
towards
the
close
of
the
day
he
said
to
him
must
regain
thy
craft
friend
herne
or
i
can
not
continue
thee
as
my
chief
keeper
the
keepers
congratulated
each
other
in
secret
for
they
felt
that
their
malice
was
about
to
be
gratified
the
next
day
herne
went
forth
as
he
thought
alone
but
he
was
watched
by
his
enemies
not
a
shaft
would
go
true
and
he
found
that
he
had
completely
lost
his
mastery
over
hound
and
horse
the
day
after
that
he
again
rode
forth
to
hunt
with
the
king
and
his
failures
made
him
the
of
the
party
richard
at
length
dismissed
him
with
these
words
repose
for
a
week
and
then
thou
shalt
have
a
further
trial
if
thou
dost
not
then
succeed
i
must
perforce
discharge
thee
from
thy
post
instead
of
returning
to
the
castle
herne
rode
off
wildly
into
the
forest
where
he
remained
till
eventide
he
then
returned
with
ghastly
looks
and
a
strange
appearance
having
the
links
of
a
rusty
chain
which
he
had
plucked
from
a
gibbet
hanging
from
his
left
arm
and
the
antlered
skull
which
he
had
procured
from
urswick
fixed
like
a
helm
upon
his
head
his
whole
demeanour
showed
that
he
was
crazed
and
his
condition
which
might
have
moved
the
compassion
of
his
foes
only
provoked
their
laughter
after
committing
the
wildest
extravagances
he
burst
from
all
restraint
and
disappeared
among
the
trees
of
the
home
park
an
hour
after
this
a
pedlar
who
was
crossing
the
park
from
datchet
found
him
suspended
by
a
rope
from
a
branch
of
the
which
you
have
all
seen
and
which
bears
his
name
despair
had
driven
him
to
the
dreadful
deed
instead
of
cutting
him
down
the
pedlar
ran
to
the
castle
to
relate
what
he
had
witnessed
and
the
keepers
satisfied
that
their
revenge
was
now
fully
accomplished
hastened
with
him
to
the
tree
but
the
body
was
gone
and
all
that
proclaimed
it
had
been
there
was
the
rope
hanging
from
the
branch
search
was
everywhere
made
for
the
missing
body
but
without
effect
when
the
matter
was
related
to
the
king
he
was
much
troubled
and
would
fain
have
had
masses
said
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
the
unfortunate
keeper
but
the
priests
refused
to
perform
them
alleging
that
he
had
and
was
therefore
out
of
the
pale
of
the
church
on
that
night
a
terrible
thunderstorm
occurred
as
terrible
it
may
be
as
that
of
last
night
and
during
its
continuance
the
oak
on
which
herne
had
hanged
himself
was
blasted
by
the
lightning
old
osmond
was
immediately
reinstated
in
his
post
of
chief
keeper
but
he
had
little
time
for
rejoicing
for
he
found
that
the
same
spell
that
had
bound
herne
had
fallen
upon
him
his
bolts
and
arrows
went
wide
of
their
mark
his
hounds
lost
their
scent
and
his
falcon
would
not
be
lured
back
half
frantic
and
afraid
of
exposing
himself
to
the
taunts
of
his
companions
he
feigned
illness
and
left
his
comrade
roger
barfoot
to
take
his
place
but
the
same
befell
barfoot
and
he
returned
in
woeful
plight
without
a
single
head
of
game
four
others
were
equally
unfortunate
and
it
was
now
clear
that
the
whole
party
were
bewitched
luckily
the
king
had
quitted
the
castle
but
they
felt
certain
they
should
be
dismissed
on
his
return
if
not
more
severely
punished
at
last
after
taking
counsel
together
they
resolved
to
consult
urswick
who
they
doubted
not
could
remove
the
spell
accordingly
they
went
to
bagshot
heath
and
related
their
story
to
him
when
they
had
done
he
said
curse
of
herne
blood
is
upon
you
and
can
only
be
removed
in
one
way
as
you
return
to
the
castle
go
to
the
tree
on
which
he
destroyed
himself
and
you
may
learn
how
to
act
the
keepers
would
have
questioned
him
further
but
he
refused
to
answer
and
dismissed
them
the
shades
of
evening
had
fallen
as
they
quitted
bagshot
and
it
was
midnight
as
they
entered
the
home
park
and
proceeded
towards
the
fatal
oak
it
was
pitchy
dark
and
they
could
only
distinguish
the
tree
by
its
white
scathed
trunk
all
at
once
a
blue
flame
like
a
appeared
flitted
thrice
round
the
tree
and
then
remained
stationary
its
light
falling
upon
a
figure
in
a
wild
garb
with
a
rusty
chain
hanging
from
its
left
arm
and
an
antlered
helm
upon
its
head
they
knew
it
to
be
herne
and
instantly
fell
down
before
him
while
a
burst
of
terrible
laughter
sounded
in
their
ears
without
heeding
them
further
the
spirit
darted
round
the
tree
rattling
its
chain
and
uttering
appalling
imprecations
it
then
stopped
and
turning
to
the
terrified
beholders
bade
them
in
a
hollow
voice
bring
hounds
and
horses
as
for
the
chase
on
the
following
night
and
vanished
filled
with
dread
the
keepers
returned
home
and
the
next
day
old
osmond
again
sought
the
forester
and
told
him
what
had
occurred
must
obey
the
spirit
injunctions
or
worse
mischief
will
befall
you
said
urswick
to
the
tree
mounted
as
for
a
and
take
the
black
steed
given
to
herne
by
the
king
and
the
two
black
hounds
with
you
you
will
see
what
will
ensue
and
without
another
word
he
dismissed
him
osmond
told
his
comrades
what
the
forester
had
said
and
though
they
were
filled
with
alarm
they
resolved
upon
compliance
at
midnight
therefore
they
rode
towards
the
tree
with
the
black
hounds
in
leash
and
leading
herne
favourite
horse
saddled
and
bridled
as
they
drew
near
they
again
saw
the
terrible
shape
stalking
round
the
tree
and
heard
the
fearful
imprecations
his
spells
ended
herne
called
to
osmond
to
bring
him
his
steed
and
the
old
man
tremblingly
obeyed
in
an
instant
the
mysterious
being
vaulted
on
its
back
and
in
a
voice
of
resistless
authority
cried
the
forest
to
the
forest
with
this
he
dashed
forward
and
the
whole
party
hounds
and
men
hurried
after
him
they
rode
at
a
furious
pace
for
five
or
six
miles
over
the
great
park
the
keepers
wondering
where
their
unearthly
leader
was
taking
them
and
almost
fancying
they
were
hurrying
to
perdition
when
they
descended
a
hillside
leading
to
the
marsh
and
halted
before
a
huge
where
herne
dismounted
and
pronounced
certain
mystic
words
accompanying
them
with
strange
gestures
presently
he
became
silent
and
motionless
a
flash
of
fire
then
burst
from
the
roots
of
the
tree
and
the
forester
urswick
stood
before
him
but
his
aspect
was
more
terrible
and
commanding
than
it
had
seemed
heretofore
to
the
keepers
herne
he
cried
lord
of
the
forest
and
you
his
comrades
and
soon
to
be
his
followers
welcome
too
the
time
is
come
for
the
fulfilment
of
your
promise
to
me
i
require
you
to
form
a
band
for
herne
the
hunter
and
to
serve
him
as
leader
swear
to
obey
him
and
the
spell
that
hangs
over
you
shall
be
broken
if
not
i
leave
you
to
the
king
justice
not
daring
to
refuse
compliance
the
keepers
took
the
oath
proposed
and
a
fearful
one
it
was
as
soon
as
it
was
urswick
vanished
as
he
came
in
a
flash
of
fire
herne
then
commanded
the
others
to
dismount
and
made
them
prostrate
themselves
before
him
and
pay
him
homage
this
done
he
blew
a
strike
on
his
horn
rode
swiftly
up
the
hillside
and
a
stag
being
unharboured
the
chase
commenced
many
a
fat
buck
was
hunted
and
slaughtered
that
night
and
an
hour
before
daybreak
herne
commanded
them
to
lay
the
four
finest
and
fattest
at
the
foot
of
the
and
then
dismissed
them
bidding
them
meet
him
at
midnight
at
the
scathed
oak
in
the
home
park
they
came
as
they
were
commanded
but
fearful
of
detection
they
adopted
strange
disguises
not
unlike
those
worn
by
the
caitiffs
who
were
put
to
death
a
few
weeks
ago
by
the
king
in
the
great
park
night
after
night
they
thus
went
forth
thinning
the
herds
of
deer
and
committing
other
outrages
and
depredations
nor
were
their
dark
proceedings
altogether
unnoticed
belated
travellers
crossing
the
forest
beheld
them
and
related
what
they
had
seen
others
watched
for
them
but
they
were
so
effectually
disguised
that
they
escaped
detection
at
last
however
the
king
returned
to
the
castle
and
accounts
of
the
strange
doings
in
the
forest
were
instantly
brought
to
him
astonished
at
what
he
heard
and
determined
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
the
statement
he
ordered
the
keepers
to
attend
him
that
night
in
an
expedition
to
the
forest
when
he
hoped
to
encounter
the
demon
huntsman
and
his
hand
much
alarmed
osmond
crooke
who
acted
as
spokesman
endeavoured
by
representing
the
risk
he
would
incur
to
dissuade
the
king
from
the
enterprise
but
he
would
not
be
deterred
and
they
now
gave
themselves
up
for
lost
as
the
castle
clock
tolled
forth
the
hour
of
midnight
richard
accompanied
by
a
numerous
guard
and
attended
by
the
keepers
issued
from
the
gates
and
rode
towards
the
scathed
oak
as
they
drew
near
the
tree
the
figure
of
herne
mounted
on
his
black
steed
was
discerned
beneath
it
deep
fear
fell
upon
all
the
beholders
but
chiefly
upon
the
guilty
keepers
at
the
sight
the
king
however
pressed
forward
and
cried
does
thou
disturb
the
quietude
of
night
accursed
spirit
because
i
desire
vengeance
replied
herne
in
a
hollow
voice
was
brought
to
my
present
woeful
condition
by
osmond
crooke
and
his
comrades
you
died
by
your
own
hand
did
you
not
demanded
king
richard
replied
herne
i
was
driven
to
the
deed
by
an
infernal
spell
laid
upon
me
by
the
malice
of
the
wretches
i
have
denounced
hang
them
upon
this
tree
and
i
will
trouble
these
woods
no
longer
whilst
thou
reignest
the
king
looked
round
at
the
keepers
they
all
remained
obdurate
except
roger
barfoot
who
falling
on
his
knees
confessed
his
guilt
and
accused
the
others
it
is
enough
cried
the
king
to
herne
shall
all
suffer
for
their
offence
upon
this
a
flash
of
fire
enveloped
the
spirit
and
his
horse
and
he
vanished
the
king
kept
his
word
osmond
and
his
comrades
were
all
hanged
upon
the
scathed
tree
nor
was
herne
seen
again
in
the
forest
while
richard
sat
upon
the
throne
but
he
reappeared
with
a
new
band
at
the
commencement
of
the
rule
of
henry
the
fourth
and
again
hunted
the
deer
at
night
his
band
was
destroyed
but
he
defied
all
attempts
at
capture
and
so
it
has
continued
to
our
own
time
for
not
one
of
the
seven
monarchs
who
have
held
the
castle
since
richard
day
have
been
able
to
drive
him
from
the
nor
will
the
present
monarch
be
able
to
drive
him
thence
said
a
deep
voice
as
long
as
windsor
forest
endures
herne
the
hunter
will
haunt
all
turned
at
the
exclamation
and
saw
that
it
proceeded
from
a
tall
dark
man
in
an
archer
garb
standing
behind
simon
quanden
chair
thou
hast
told
thy
legend
fairly
enough
good
clerk
of
the
kitchen
continued
this
personage
but
thou
art
wrong
on
many
material
i
have
related
the
story
as
it
was
related
to
me
said
cutbeard
somewhat
nettled
at
the
remark
but
perhaps
you
will
set
me
right
where
i
have
it
is
true
that
herne
was
a
keeper
in
the
reign
of
richard
the
second
replied
the
tall
archer
it
is
true
also
that
he
was
expert
in
all
matters
of
woodcraft
and
that
he
was
in
high
favour
with
the
king
but
he
was
bewitched
by
a
lovely
damsel
and
not
by
a
weird
forester
he
carried
off
a
nun
and
dwelt
with
her
in
a
cave
in
the
forest
where
he
assembled
his
brother
keepers
and
treated
them
to
the
king
venison
and
the
king
wine
a
sacreligious
villain
and
a
reprobate
exclaimed
launcelot
rutter
his
mistress
was
fair
enough
i
will
warrant
her
said
kit
coo
she
was
the
very
image
of
this
damsel
rejoined
the
tall
archer
pointing
to
mabel
and
fair
enough
to
work
his
ruin
for
it
was
through
her
that
the
fiend
tempted
him
the
charms
that
proved
his
undoing
were
fatal
to
her
also
for
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
he
slew
her
the
remorse
occasioned
by
this
deed
made
him
destroy
well
your
version
of
the
legend
may
be
the
correct
one
for
aught
i
know
worthy
sir
said
cutbeard
but
i
see
not
that
it
accounts
for
herne
antlers
so
well
as
mine
unless
he
were
wedded
to
the
nun
who
you
say
played
him
false
but
how
came
you
to
know
she
resembled
mabel
lyndwood
ay
i
was
thinking
of
that
myself
said
simon
quanden
how
do
you
know
that
master
because
i
have
seen
her
picture
replied
the
tall
archer
painted
by
satan
chief
limner
i
suppose
rejoined
cutbeard
he
who
painted
it
had
seen
her
replied
the
tall
archer
sternly
but
as
i
have
said
it
was
the
very
image
of
this
and
as
he
uttered
the
words
he
quitted
the
kitchen
who
is
that
archer
demanded
cutbeard
looking
after
him
but
no
one
could
answer
the
question
nor
could
any
one
tell
when
he
had
entered
the
kitchen
strange
exclaimed
simon
quanden
crossing
himself
have
you
ever
seen
him
before
mabel
i
almost
think
i
have
she
replied
with
a
slight
shudder
i
half
suspect
he
is
herne
himself
whispered
the
duke
of
shoreditch
to
paddington
it
may
be
responded
the
other
his
glance
made
my
blood
run
you
look
somewhat
fatigued
sweetheart
said
deborah
observing
mabel
uneasiness
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
to
a
glad
to
escape
mabel
followed
the
good
dame
out
of
the
kitchen
and
they
ascended
a
winding
staircase
which
brought
them
to
a
commodious
chamber
in
the
upper
part
of
henry
the
seventh
buildings
where
deborah
sat
down
with
her
young
charge
and
volunteered
a
great
deal
of
good
advice
to
her
which
the
other
listened
to
with
becoming
attention
and
promised
to
profit
by
it
vii
of
the
mysterious
noise
heard
in
the
curfew
tower
on
quitting
the
kitchen
henry
having
been
informed
by
bouchier
that
tristram
lyndwood
was
lodged
in
the
in
the
lower
gateway
proceeded
thither
to
question
him
he
found
the
old
man
seated
on
a
bench
with
his
hands
tied
behind
him
but
though
evidently
much
alarmed
at
his
situation
he
could
not
be
brought
either
by
threats
or
proffers
to
make
any
confession
out
of
patience
at
length
the
king
ordered
him
to
be
conveyed
to
the
dungeon
beneath
the
curfew
tower
and
personally
superintended
his
removal
i
will
find
a
means
of
shaking
his
obstinacy
said
henry
as
he
quitted
the
vault
with
bouchier
if
i
can
not
move
him
by
other
means
i
may
through
his
granddaughter
i
will
interrogate
him
in
her
presence
sire
exclaimed
bouchier
ay
repeated
the
king
i
am
resolved
even
if
it
should
cost
the
life
of
this
maiden
whose
charms
have
moved
me
so
to
break
the
infernal
machinery
woven
around
me
and
now
as
i
think
it
not
unlikely
the
miscreant
herne
may
attempt
the
prisoner
deliverance
let
the
strictest
watch
be
kept
over
the
tower
station
an
arquebusier
throughout
the
night
at
the
door
of
the
dungeon
and
another
at
the
entrance
to
the
chamber
on
the
ground
floor
your
own
post
must
be
on
the
roof
of
the
fortification
that
you
may
watch
if
any
attempt
is
made
to
scale
it
from
the
town
side
or
to
get
in
through
the
loopholes
keep
a
sharp
lookout
bouchier
for
i
shall
hold
you
responsible
if
any
mischance
i
will
do
my
best
my
liege
replied
bouchier
and
were
it
with
a
mortal
foe
i
had
to
contend
i
should
have
no
fear
but
what
vigilance
can
avail
against
a
fiend
you
have
heard
my
injunctions
and
will
attend
to
them
rejoined
the
king
harshly
i
shall
return
anon
to
the
so
saying
he
departed
brave
as
a
lion
on
ordinary
occasions
bouchier
entered
upon
his
present
duty
with
reluctance
and
misgiving
and
he
found
the
arquebusiers
by
whom
he
was
attended
albeit
stout
soldiers
equally
uneasy
herne
had
now
become
an
object
of
general
dread
throughout
the
castle
and
the
possibility
of
an
encounter
with
him
was
enough
to
daunt
the
boldest
breast
disguising
his
alarm
bouchier
issued
his
directions
in
an
authoritative
tone
and
then
mounted
with
three
arquebusiers
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
it
was
now
dark
but
the
moon
soon
arose
and
her
beams
rendered
every
object
as
distinguishable
as
daylight
would
have
done
so
that
watch
was
easily
kept
but
nothing
occurred
to
occasion
alarm
until
all
at
once
a
noise
like
that
of
a
hammer
stricken
against
a
board
was
heard
in
the
chamber
below
drawing
his
sword
bouchier
hurried
down
the
steps
leading
into
this
chamber
which
was
buried
in
darkness
and
advanced
so
precipitately
and
incautiously
into
the
gloom
that
he
struck
his
head
against
a
crossbeam
the
violence
of
the
blow
stunned
him
for
a
moment
but
as
soon
as
he
recovered
he
called
to
the
guard
in
the
lower
chamber
to
bring
up
a
torch
the
order
was
promptly
obeyed
but
meanwhile
the
sound
had
ceased
and
though
they
searched
about
they
could
not
discover
the
occasion
of
it
this
however
was
not
so
wonderful
for
the
singular
construction
of
the
chamber
with
its
numerous
crossbeams
its
deep
embrasures
and
recesses
its
insecure
and
uneven
floor
its
steep
staircases
was
highly
favourable
to
concealment
it
being
utterly
impossible
owing
to
the
intersections
of
the
beams
for
the
searchers
to
see
far
before
them
or
to
move
about
quickly
in
the
midst
of
the
chamber
was
a
large
wooden
compartment
enclosing
the
cumbrous
and
uncouth
machinery
of
the
castle
clock
and
through
the
box
ran
the
cord
communicating
with
the
belfry
above
at
that
time
pieces
of
ordnance
were
mounted
in
all
the
embrasures
but
there
is
now
only
one
gun
placed
in
a
porthole
commanding
thames
street
and
the
long
thoroughfare
leading
to
eton
the
view
from
this
porthole
of
the
groves
of
eton
and
of
the
lovely
plains
on
the
watered
by
the
river
is
enchanting
beyond
description
viewed
from
a
recess
which
has
been
partly
closed
the
appearance
of
this
chamber
is
equally
picturesque
and
singular
and
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
pass
beneath
its
huge
beams
or
to
gaze
at
the
fantastic
yet
striking
combinations
they
form
in
connection
with
the
deep
embrasures
the
steep
staircases
and
and
not
feel
that
the
whole
place
belongs
to
romance
and
that
a
multitude
of
strange
and
startling
stories
must
be
connected
with
it
the
old
architects
were
indeed
great
romancers
and
built
for
the
painter
and
the
poet
bouchier
and
his
companion
crept
about
under
the
great
meshwork
of
into
all
the
embrasures
and
beneath
the
carriages
of
the
culverins
there
was
a
heap
of
planks
and
beams
lying
on
the
floor
between
the
two
staircases
but
no
one
was
near
it
the
result
of
their
investigations
did
not
tend
to
decrease
their
alarm
bouchier
would
fain
have
had
the
man
keep
watch
in
the
chamber
but
neither
threats
nor
entreaties
could
induce
him
to
remain
there
he
was
therefore
sent
below
and
the
captain
returned
to
the
roof
he
had
scarcely
emerged
upon
the
leads
when
the
hammering
recommenced
more
violently
than
before
in
vain
bouchier
ordered
his
men
to
go
down
no
one
would
stir
and
superstitious
fear
had
by
this
time
obtained
such
mastery
over
the
captain
that
he
hesitated
to
descend
alone
to
add
to
his
vexation
the
arquebusier
had
taken
the
torch
with
him
so
that
he
should
have
to
proceed
in
darkness
at
length
he
mustered
up
courage
to
make
the
attempt
but
he
paused
between
each
step
peering
through
the
gloom
and
half
fancying
he
could
discern
the
figure
of
herne
near
the
spot
where
the
pile
of
wood
lay
certain
it
was
that
the
sound
of
diabolical
laughter
mingled
with
the
rattling
of
the
chain
and
the
sharp
blows
of
the
hammer
smote
his
ears
the
laughter
became
yet
louder
as
bouchier
advanced
the
hammering
ceased
and
the
clanking
of
the
chain
showed
that
its
mysterious
wearer
was
approaching
the
foot
of
the
steps
to
meet
him
but
the
captain
had
not
nerve
enough
for
the
encounter
invoking
the
protection
of
the
saints
he
beat
a
precipitate
retreat
and
closed
the
little
door
at
the
head
of
the
steps
after
him
the
demon
was
apparently
satisfied
with
the
alarm
he
had
occasioned
for
the
hammering
was
not
renewed
at
that
time
viii
showing
the
vacillations
of
the
king
between
wolsey
and
anne
boleyn
before
returning
to
the
state
apartments
henry
took
a
turn
on
the
ramparts
on
the
north
side
of
the
castle
between
the
curfew
tower
and
the
winchester
tower
and
lingered
for
a
short
time
on
the
bastion
commanding
that
part
of
the
acclivity
where
the
approach
called
the
hundred
steps
is
now
contrived
here
he
cautioned
the
sentinels
to
be
doubly
vigilant
throughout
the
night
and
having
gazed
for
a
moment
at
the
placid
stream
flowing
at
the
foot
of
the
castle
and
tinged
with
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
he
proceeded
to
the
royal
lodgings
and
entered
the
banquet
chamber
where
supper
was
already
served
wolsey
sat
on
his
right
hand
but
he
did
not
vouchsafe
him
a
single
word
addressing
the
whole
of
his
discourse
to
the
duke
of
suffolk
who
was
placed
on
his
left
as
soon
as
the
repast
was
over
he
retired
to
his
closet
but
the
cardinal
would
not
be
so
repulsed
and
sent
one
of
his
gentlemen
to
crave
a
moment
audience
of
the
king
which
with
some
reluctance
was
accorded
well
cardinal
cried
henry
as
wolsey
presented
himself
and
the
usher
withdrew
you
are
playing
a
deep
game
with
me
as
you
think
but
take
heed
for
i
see
through
i
pray
you
dismiss
these
suspicions
from
your
mind
my
liege
said
wolsey
no
servant
was
ever
more
faithful
to
his
master
than
i
have
been
to
no
servant
ever
took
better
care
of
himself
cried
the
king
fiercely
not
alone
have
you
wronged
me
to
enrich
yourself
but
you
are
ever
intriguing
with
my
enemies
i
have
nourished
in
my
breast
a
viper
but
i
will
cast
you
off
will
crush
you
as
i
would
the
noxious
and
he
stamped
upon
the
floor
as
if
he
could
have
trampled
the
cardinal
beneath
his
foot
beseech
you
calm
yourself
my
liege
replied
wolsey
in
the
soft
and
deprecatory
tone
which
he
had
seldom
known
to
fail
with
the
king
i
have
never
thought
of
my
own
aggrandisement
but
as
it
was
likely
to
advance
your
power
for
the
countless
benefits
i
have
received
at
your
hands
my
soul
overflows
with
gratitude
you
have
raised
me
from
the
meanest
condition
to
the
highest
you
have
made
me
your
confidant
your
adviser
your
treasurer
and
with
no
improper
boldness
i
say
it
your
friend
but
i
defy
the
enemies
who
have
poisoned
your
ears
against
me
to
prove
that
i
have
ever
abused
the
trust
placed
in
me
the
sole
fault
that
can
be
imputed
to
me
is
that
i
have
meddled
more
with
temporal
matters
than
with
spiritual
and
it
is
a
crime
for
which
i
must
answer
before
heaven
but
i
have
so
acted
because
i
felt
that
i
might
thereby
best
serve
your
highness
if
i
have
aspired
to
the
papal
throne
which
you
well
know
i
have
it
has
been
that
i
might
be
yet
a
more
powerful
friend
to
your
majesty
and
render
you
what
you
are
entitled
to
be
the
first
prince
in
tut
tut
exclaimed
the
king
who
was
nevertheless
moved
by
the
artful
appeal
the
gifts
i
have
received
from
foreign
princes
pursued
wolsey
seeing
the
effect
he
had
produced
the
wealth
i
have
amassed
have
all
been
with
a
view
of
benefiting
your
humph
exclaimed
the
king
to
prove
that
i
speak
the
truth
sire
continued
the
wily
cardinal
the
palace
at
hampton
court
which
i
have
just
completed
and
at
a
cost
more
lavish
than
i
myself
should
have
expended
on
it
interrupted
the
king
angrily
if
i
had
destined
it
for
myself
i
should
not
have
spent
a
tithe
of
what
i
have
done
rejoined
wolsey
your
highness
unjust
accusations
force
me
to
declare
my
intentions
somewhat
prematurely
deign
he
cried
throwing
at
the
king
feet
deign
to
accept
that
palace
and
all
within
it
you
were
pleased
during
your
late
residence
there
to
express
your
approval
of
it
and
i
trust
it
will
find
equal
favour
in
your
eyes
now
that
it
is
your
by
holy
mary
a
royal
gift
cried
henry
rise
you
are
not
the
grasping
selfish
person
you
have
been
declare
as
much
to
my
enemies
sire
and
i
shall
be
more
content
you
will
find
the
palace
better
worth
acceptance
than
at
first
sight
might
how
so
cried
the
king
your
highness
will
be
pleased
to
take
this
key
said
the
cardinal
it
is
the
key
of
the
you
have
some
choice
wine
there
cried
henry
significantly
given
you
by
some
religious
house
or
sent
you
by
some
foreign
potentate
ha
it
is
wine
that
a
king
might
prize
replied
the
cardinal
your
majesty
will
find
a
hundred
hogsheads
in
that
cellar
and
each
hogshead
filled
with
you
amaze
me
cried
the
king
feigning
astonishment
and
all
this
you
freely
give
me
freely
and
fully
sire
replied
wolsey
nay
i
have
saved
it
for
you
men
think
i
have
cared
for
myself
whereas
i
have
cared
only
for
your
majesty
oh
my
dear
liege
by
the
devotion
i
have
just
approved
to
you
and
which
i
would
also
approve
if
needful
with
my
life
i
beseech
you
to
consider
well
before
you
raise
anne
boleyn
to
the
throne
in
giving
you
this
counsel
i
know
i
hazard
the
favour
i
have
just
regained
but
even
at
that
hazard
i
must
offer
it
your
infatuation
blinds
you
to
the
terrible
consequences
of
the
step
the
union
is
odious
to
all
your
subjects
but
most
of
all
to
those
not
tainted
with
the
new
heresies
and
opinions
it
will
never
be
forgiven
by
the
emperor
charles
the
fifth
who
will
seek
to
avenge
the
indignity
offered
to
his
illustrious
relative
while
francis
will
gladly
make
it
a
pretext
for
breaking
his
truce
with
you
add
to
this
the
displeasure
of
the
apostolic
see
and
it
must
be
apparent
that
powerful
as
you
are
your
position
will
be
one
of
infinite
thus
far
advanced
i
can
not
honourably
abandon
the
divorce
said
henry
nor
do
i
advise
its
abandonment
sire
replied
wolsey
but
do
not
let
it
be
a
means
of
injuring
you
with
all
men
do
not
let
a
place
your
very
throne
in
jeopardy
as
with
your
own
subjects
and
all
foreign
powers
against
you
must
necessarily
be
the
you
speak
warmly
cardinal
said
henry
my
zeal
prompts
me
to
do
so
replied
wolsey
anne
boleyn
is
in
no
respect
worthy
of
the
honour
you
propose
and
whom
do
you
think
more
worthy
demanded
henry
those
whom
i
have
already
recommended
to
your
majesty
the
duchess
or
the
princess
renee
replied
wolsey
by
a
union
with
either
of
whom
you
would
secure
the
cordial
of
francis
and
the
interests
of
the
see
of
rome
which
in
the
event
of
a
war
with
spain
you
may
no
wolsey
replied
henry
taking
a
hasty
turn
across
the
chamber
no
considerations
of
interests
or
security
shall
induce
me
to
give
up
anne
i
love
her
too
well
for
that
let
the
lion
charles
roar
the
fox
francis
snarl
and
the
clement
launch
forth
his
flames
i
will
remain
firm
to
my
purpose
i
will
not
play
the
hypocrite
with
you
whatever
i
may
do
with
others
i
cast
off
catherine
that
i
may
wed
anne
because
i
can
not
otherwise
obtain
her
and
shall
i
now
when
i
have
dared
so
much
and
when
the
prize
is
within
my
grasp
abandon
it
never
threats
expostulations
entreaties
are
alike
i
grieve
to
hear
it
my
liege
replied
wolsey
heaving
a
deep
sigh
it
is
an
union
and
will
bring
woe
to
you
woe
to
your
realm
and
woe
to
the
catholic
and
woe
to
you
also
false
cardinal
cried
anne
boleyn
throwing
aside
the
arras
and
stepping
forward
i
have
overheard
what
has
passed
and
from
my
heart
of
hearts
i
thank
you
henry
for
the
love
you
have
displayed
for
me
but
i
here
solemnly
vow
never
to
give
my
hand
to
you
till
wolsey
is
dismissed
from
your
anne
exclaimed
the
king
my
own
enmity
i
could
forego
pursued
anne
vehemently
but
i
can
not
forgive
him
his
duplicity
and
perfidy
towards
you
he
has
just
proffered
you
his
splendid
palace
of
hampton
and
his
treasures
and
wherefore
i
will
tell
you
because
he
feared
they
would
be
wrested
from
him
his
jester
had
acquainted
him
with
the
discovery
just
made
of
the
secret
hoard
and
he
was
therefore
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
this
desperate
move
but
i
was
apprized
of
his
intentions
by
will
sommers
and
have
come
in
time
to
foil
by
my
faith
i
believe
you
are
right
sweetheart
said
the
king
go
tell
your
allies
francis
and
clement
that
the
king
love
for
me
outweighs
his
fear
of
them
cried
anne
laughing
spitefully
as
for
you
i
regard
you
as
vain
woman
your
pride
will
be
abased
rejoined
wolsey
bitterly
vain
man
you
are
already
abased
replied
anne
a
few
weeks
ago
i
would
have
made
terms
with
you
now
i
am
your
mortal
enemy
and
will
never
rest
till
i
have
procured
your
the
king
will
have
an
amiable
consort
truly
sneered
wolsey
he
will
have
one
who
can
love
him
and
hate
his
foes
replied
anne
and
not
one
who
would
side
with
them
and
thee
as
would
be
the
case
with
the
duchess
or
the
princess
renee
henry
you
know
the
sole
terms
on
which
you
can
procure
my
the
king
nodded
a
playful
affirmative
then
dismiss
him
at
once
disgrace
him
said
anne
nay
nay
replied
henry
the
divorce
is
not
yet
passed
you
are
angered
now
and
will
view
matters
more
coolly
i
shall
never
change
my
resolution
she
replied
if
my
dismissal
and
disgrace
can
save
my
sovereign
i
pray
him
to
sacrifice
me
without
hesitation
said
wolsey
but
while
i
have
liberty
of
speech
with
him
and
aught
of
power
remaining
i
will
use
it
to
his
advantage
i
pray
your
majesty
suffer
me
to
and
receiving
a
sign
of
acquiescence
from
the
king
he
withdrew
amid
the
triumphant
laughter
of
anne
ix
how
tristram
lyndwood
was
interrogated
by
the
king
anne
boleyn
remained
with
her
royal
lover
for
a
few
minutes
to
pour
forth
her
gratitude
for
the
attachment
he
had
displayed
to
her
and
to
confirm
the
advantage
she
had
gained
over
wolsey
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
henry
summoned
an
usher
and
giving
him
some
instructions
respecting
mabel
lyndwood
proceeded
to
the
curfew
tower
nothing
was
said
to
him
of
the
strange
noise
that
had
been
heard
in
the
upper
chamber
for
the
arquebusiers
were
fearful
of
exciting
his
displeasure
by
a
confession
of
their
alarm
and
he
descended
at
once
to
the
dungeon
well
fellow
he
cried
sternly
regarding
the
captive
who
arose
at
his
entrance
you
have
now
had
ample
time
for
reflection
and
i
trust
are
in
a
better
frame
of
mind
than
when
i
last
spoke
with
you
i
command
you
to
declare
all
you
know
concerning
herne
the
hunter
and
to
give
me
such
information
respecting
the
proscribed
felon
morgan
fenwolf
as
will
enable
me
to
accomplish
his
i
have
already
told
your
highness
that
my
mouth
is
sealed
by
an
oath
of
secrecy
replied
tristram
humbly
but
firmly
obstinate
dog
thou
shalt
either
speak
or
i
will
hang
thee
from
the
top
of
this
tower
as
i
hanged
mark
fytton
the
butcher
roared
henry
you
will
execute
your
sovereign
pleasure
my
liege
said
the
old
man
my
life
is
in
your
hands
it
is
little
matter
whether
it
is
closed
now
or
a
year
hence
i
have
well
nigh
run
out
my
if
thou
carest
not
for
thyself
thou
mayest
not
be
equally
indifferent
to
another
cried
the
king
what
ho
bring
in
his
the
old
man
started
at
the
command
and
trembled
violently
the
next
moment
mabel
was
led
into
the
dungeon
by
shoreditch
and
paddington
behind
her
came
nicholas
clamp
on
seeing
her
grandsire
she
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
would
have
rushed
towards
him
but
she
was
held
back
by
her
companions
oh
grandfather
she
cried
what
have
you
done
do
i
find
you
here
tristram
groaned
and
averted
his
head
he
is
charged
with
felony
and
sorcery
said
the
king
sternly
and
you
maiden
come
under
the
same
believe
it
not
sire
cried
the
old
man
flinging
himself
at
feet
oh
believe
it
not
whatever
you
may
judge
of
me
believe
her
innocent
she
was
brought
up
most
devoutly
by
a
lay
sister
of
the
monastery
at
chertsey
and
she
knows
nothing
save
by
report
of
what
passes
in
the
yet
she
has
seen
and
conversed
with
morgan
fenwolf
the
king
not
since
he
was
outlawed
said
tristram
i
saw
him
to
day
as
i
was
brought
to
the
castle
cried
mabel
and
but
recollecting
that
she
might
implicate
her
grandfather
she
suddenly
stopped
what
said
he
ha
demanded
the
king
i
will
tell
your
majesty
what
passed
interposed
nicholas
clamp
stepping
forward
for
i
was
with
the
damsel
at
the
time
he
came
upon
us
suddenly
from
behind
a
great
tree
and
ordered
her
to
accompany
him
to
her
ha
exclaimed
the
king
but
he
had
no
authority
for
what
he
said
i
am
well
convinced
pursued
clamp
mabel
disbelieved
him
and
refused
to
go
and
i
should
have
captured
him
if
the
fiend
he
serves
had
not
lent
him
a
helping
what
says
the
prisoner
himself
to
this
observed
the
king
didst
thou
send
fenwolf
on
the
errand
i
did
replied
tristram
i
sent
him
to
prevent
her
from
going
to
the
mabel
sobbed
audibly
thou
art
condemned
by
thy
own
confession
caitiff
said
the
king
and
thou
knowest
upon
what
terms
alone
thou
canst
save
thyself
from
the
hangman
and
thy
from
the
oh
mercy
sire
mercy
shrieked
mabel
your
fate
rests
with
your
grandsire
said
the
king
sternly
if
he
chooses
to
be
your
executioner
he
will
remain
oh
speak
grandsire
speak
cried
mabel
what
matters
the
violation
of
an
unholy
vow
give
me
till
for
consideration
sire
said
the
old
man
thou
shalt
have
till
midnight
replied
the
king
and
till
then
mabel
shall
remain
with
i
would
rather
be
left
alone
said
tristram
i
doubt
it
not
replied
the
king
but
it
shall
not
and
without
bestowing
a
look
at
mabel
whose
supplications
he
feared
might
shake
his
purpose
he
quitted
the
vault
with
his
attendants
leaving
her
alone
with
her
grandsire
i
shall
return
at
midnight
he
said
to
the
arquebusier
stationed
at
the
door
and
meanwhile
let
no
one
enter
the
dungeon
not
even
the
duke
of
suffolk
unless
he
added
holding
forth
his
hand
to
display
a
ring
he
shall
bring
this
x
of
the
brief
advantage
gained
by
the
queen
and
the
cardinal
as
the
king
wholly
unattended
for
he
had
left
the
archers
at
the
curfew
tower
was
passing
at
the
back
of
saint
george
chapel
near
the
north
transept
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
at
the
embattled
entrance
to
the
new
commons
a
structure
erected
in
the
eleventh
year
of
his
own
reign
by
james
denton
a
canon
and
afterwards
dean
of
lichfield
for
the
accommodation
of
such
chantry
priests
and
choristers
as
had
no
place
in
the
college
over
the
doorway
surmounted
by
a
niche
ran
and
still
runs
the
inscription
aedes
pro
sacellanorum
choristarum
coviviis
extructa
the
building
has
since
been
converted
into
one
of
the
canons
houses
while
he
was
contemplating
this
beautiful
gateway
which
was
glimmering
in
the
bright
moonlight
a
tall
figure
suddenly
darted
from
behind
one
of
the
buttresses
of
the
chapel
and
seized
his
left
arm
with
an
iron
grasp
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
took
him
by
surprise
but
he
instantly
recovered
himself
plucked
away
his
arm
and
drawing
his
sword
made
a
pass
at
his
assailant
who
however
avoided
the
thrust
and
darted
with
inconceivable
swiftness
through
the
archway
leading
to
the
cloisters
though
henry
followed
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
lost
sight
of
the
fugitive
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
enter
the
passage
running
between
the
and
the
chapel
he
perceived
a
person
in
the
south
ambulatory
evidently
anxious
to
conceal
himself
and
rushing
up
to
him
and
dragging
him
to
the
light
he
found
it
was
no
other
than
the
cardinal
jester
patch
what
does
thou
here
knave
cried
henry
angrily
i
am
waiting
for
my
master
the
cardinal
replied
the
jester
terrified
out
of
his
wits
waiting
for
him
here
cried
the
king
where
is
he
in
that
house
replied
patch
pointing
to
a
beautiful
full
of
stained
glass
overhanging
the
exquisite
arches
of
the
north
ambulatory
why
that
is
doctor
sampson
dwelling
cried
henry
he
who
was
chaplain
to
the
queen
and
is
a
strong
opponent
of
the
divorce
what
doth
he
there
i
am
sure
i
know
not
replied
patch
whose
terror
increased
each
moment
perhaps
i
have
mistaken
the
house
indeed
i
am
sure
it
must
be
doctor
voysey
the
next
thou
liest
knave
cried
henry
fiercely
thy
manner
convinces
me
there
is
some
treasonable
practice
going
forward
but
i
will
soon
find
it
out
attempt
to
give
the
alarm
and
i
will
cut
thy
with
this
he
proceeded
to
the
back
of
the
north
ambulatory
and
finding
the
door
he
sought
unfastened
raised
the
latch
and
walked
softly
in
but
before
he
got
down
the
passage
doctor
sampson
himself
issued
from
an
inner
room
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
he
started
on
seeing
the
king
and
exhibited
great
alarm
the
cardinal
of
york
is
here
i
know
it
said
henry
in
a
deep
whisper
lead
me
to
oh
go
not
forward
my
gracious
liege
cried
sampson
placing
himself
in
his
path
wherefore
not
rejoined
the
king
ha
what
voice
is
that
i
heard
in
the
upper
chamber
is
she
here
and
with
wolsey
out
of
my
way
man
he
added
pushing
the
canon
aside
and
rushing
up
the
short
wooden
staircase
when
wolsey
returned
from
his
interview
with
the
king
which
had
been
so
unluckily
interrupted
by
anne
boleyn
he
found
his
beset
with
a
crowd
of
suitors
to
whose
solicitations
he
was
compelled
to
listen
and
having
been
detained
in
this
manner
for
nearly
half
an
hour
he
at
length
retired
into
an
inner
room
vile
sycophants
he
muttered
they
bow
the
knee
before
me
and
pay
me
greater
homage
than
they
render
the
king
but
though
they
have
fed
upon
my
bounty
and
risen
by
my
help
not
one
of
them
if
he
was
aware
of
my
true
position
but
would
desert
me
not
one
of
them
but
would
lend
a
helping
hand
to
crush
me
not
one
but
would
rejoice
in
my
downfall
but
they
have
not
deceived
me
i
knew
them
from
the
first
saw
through
their
hollowness
and
despised
them
while
power
lasts
to
me
i
will
punish
some
of
them
while
power
lasts
he
repeated
have
i
any
power
remaining
i
have
already
given
up
hampton
and
my
treasures
to
the
king
and
the
work
of
spoliation
once
commenced
the
royal
plunderer
will
not
be
content
till
he
has
robbed
me
of
all
while
his
minion
anne
boleyn
has
vowed
my
destruction
well
i
will
not
yield
tamely
nor
fall
as
these
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
patch
who
had
waited
for
a
favourable
moment
to
approach
him
delivered
him
a
small
billet
carefully
sealed
and
fastened
with
a
silken
thread
wolsey
took
it
and
broke
it
open
and
as
his
eye
eagerly
scanned
its
contents
the
expression
of
his
countenance
totally
changed
a
flash
of
joy
and
triumph
irradiated
his
fallen
features
and
thrusting
the
note
into
the
folds
of
his
robe
he
inquired
of
the
jester
by
whom
it
had
been
brought
and
how
long
it
was
brought
by
a
messenger
from
doctor
sampson
replied
patch
and
was
committed
to
me
with
special
injunctions
to
deliver
it
to
your
grace
immediately
on
your
return
and
the
cardinal
sat
down
and
for
a
few
moments
appeared
lost
in
deep
reflection
he
then
arose
and
telling
patch
he
should
return
presently
quitted
the
chamber
but
the
jester
who
was
of
an
inquisitive
turn
and
did
not
like
to
be
confined
to
half
a
secret
determined
to
follow
him
and
accordingly
tracked
him
along
the
great
corridor
down
a
winding
staircase
through
a
private
door
near
the
norman
gateway
across
the
middle
ward
and
finally
saw
him
enter
doctor
sampson
dwelling
at
the
back
of
the
north
ambulatory
he
was
reconnoitring
the
windows
of
the
house
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
cloisters
in
the
hope
of
discovering
something
when
he
was
caught
as
before
mentioned
by
the
king
wolsey
meanwhile
was
received
by
doctor
sampson
at
the
doorway
of
his
dwelling
and
ushered
by
him
into
a
chamber
on
the
upper
floor
wainscoted
with
curiously
carved
and
lustrously
black
oak
a
silver
lamp
was
burning
the
on
the
table
and
in
the
recess
of
the
window
which
was
screened
by
thick
curtains
sat
a
majestic
lady
who
rose
on
the
cardinal
entrance
it
was
catherine
of
arragon
i
attend
your
pleasure
madam
said
wolsey
with
a
profound
inclination
you
have
been
long
in
answering
my
summons
said
the
queen
but
i
could
not
expect
greater
promptitude
time
was
when
a
summons
from
catherine
of
arragon
would
have
been
quickly
and
cheerfully
attended
to
when
the
proudest
noble
in
the
land
would
have
borne
her
message
to
you
and
when
you
would
have
passed
through
crowds
to
her
now
another
holds
her
place
and
she
is
obliged
secretly
to
enter
the
castle
where
she
once
ruled
to
despatch
a
valet
to
her
enemy
to
attend
his
pleasure
and
to
receive
him
in
the
dwelling
of
an
humble
canon
times
are
changed
with
me
wolsey
sadly
i
have
been
in
attendance
on
the
king
madam
or
i
should
have
been
with
you
sooner
replied
wolsey
it
grieves
me
sorely
to
see
you
i
want
not
your
pity
replied
the
queen
proudly
i
did
not
send
for
you
to
gratify
your
malice
by
exposing
my
abject
state
i
did
not
send
for
you
to
insult
me
by
false
sympathy
but
in
the
hope
that
your
own
interest
would
induce
you
to
redress
the
wrongs
you
have
done
alas
madam
i
fear
it
is
now
too
late
to
repair
the
error
i
have
committed
said
wolsey
in
a
tone
of
affected
penitence
and
sorrow
you
admit
then
that
it
was
an
error
cried
catherine
well
that
is
something
oh
that
you
had
paused
before
you
began
this
evil
work
before
you
had
raised
a
storm
which
will
destroy
me
and
yourself
your
quarrel
with
my
nephew
the
emperor
charles
has
cost
me
dear
but
it
will
cost
you
yet
more
i
deserve
all
your
reproaches
madam
said
wolsey
with
feigned
meekness
and
i
will
bear
them
without
a
murmur
but
you
have
sent
for
me
for
some
specific
object
i
presume
i
sent
for
you
to
give
me
aid
as
much
for
your
own
sake
as
mine
replied
the
queen
for
you
are
in
equal
danger
prevent
this
divorce
foil
anne
and
you
retain
the
king
favour
our
interests
are
so
far
leagued
together
that
you
must
serve
me
to
serve
yourself
my
object
is
to
gain
time
to
enable
my
friends
to
act
your
colleague
is
secretly
favourable
to
me
pronounce
no
sentence
here
but
let
the
cause
be
removed
to
rome
my
nephew
the
emperor
will
prevail
upon
the
pope
to
decide
in
my
i
dare
not
thus
brave
the
king
displeasure
madam
replied
wolsey
dissembler
exclaimed
catherine
i
now
perceive
the
insincerity
of
your
professions
this
much
i
have
said
to
try
you
and
now
to
my
real
motive
for
sending
for
you
i
have
in
my
possession
certain
letters
that
will
ruin
anne
boleyn
with
the
ha
exclaimed
the
cardinal
joyfully
if
that
be
the
case
all
the
rest
will
be
easy
let
me
see
the
letters
i
pray
you
before
catherine
could
reply
the
door
was
thrown
violently
open
and
the
king
stood
before
them
soh
roared
henry
casting
a
terrible
look
at
wolsey
i
have
caught
you
at
your
treasonable
practices
at
last
and
you
madam
he
added
turning
to
catherine
who
meekly
but
steadily
returned
his
gaze
what
brings
you
here
again
because
i
pardoned
your
indiscretion
yesterday
think
not
i
shall
always
be
so
lenient
you
will
leave
the
castle
instantly
as
to
wolsey
he
shall
render
me
a
strict
account
of
his
i
have
nothing
to
declare
my
liege
replied
wolsey
recovering
himself
i
leave
it
to
the
queen
to
explain
why
i
came
the
explanation
shall
be
given
at
once
said
catherine
i
sent
for
the
cardinal
to
request
him
to
lay
before
your
majesty
these
two
letters
from
anne
boleyn
to
sir
thomas
wyat
that
you
might
judge
whether
one
who
could
write
thus
would
make
you
a
fitting
consort
you
disbelieved
my
charge
of
levity
yesterday
read
these
sire
and
judge
whether
i
spoke
the
henry
glanced
at
the
letters
and
his
brow
grew
dark
what
say
you
to
them
my
liege
cried
catherine
with
a
glance
of
triumph
in
the
one
she
vows
eternal
constancy
to
sir
thomas
wyat
and
in
the
other
written
after
her
engagement
to
you
he
tells
him
that
though
they
can
never
meet
as
heretofore
she
will
always
love
ten
thousand
furies
cried
the
king
where
got
you
these
letters
madam
they
were
given
to
me
by
a
tall
dark
man
as
i
quitted
the
castle
last
night
said
the
queen
he
said
they
were
taken
from
the
person
of
sir
thomas
wyat
while
he
lay
concealed
in
the
forest
in
the
cave
of
herne
the
if
i
thought
she
wrote
them
cried
henry
in
an
access
jealous
fury
i
would
cast
her
off
for
methinks
your
majesty
should
be
able
to
judge
whether
they
are
true
or
false
said
catherine
i
know
her
writing
well
too
well
alas
and
am
satisfied
they
are
i
am
well
assured
that
wyat
was
concealed
in
the
lady
anne
chamber
when
your
majesty
demanded
admittance
and
could
not
obtain
it
when
the
earl
of
surrey
sacrificed
himself
for
her
and
for
his
friend
said
wolsey
perdition
exclaimed
the
king
striking
his
brow
with
his
clenched
hand
oh
catherine
he
continued
after
a
pause
during
which
she
intently
watched
the
workings
of
his
countenance
and
it
was
for
this
creature
i
was
about
to
cast
you
i
forgive
you
sire
i
forgive
you
exclaimed
the
queen
clasping
his
hands
and
bedewing
them
with
grateful
tears
you
have
been
deceived
heaven
keep
you
in
the
same
mind
you
have
preserved
me
said
henry
but
you
must
not
tarry
here
come
with
me
to
the
royal
no
henry
replied
catherine
with
a
shudder
not
while
she
is
make
no
conditions
madam
whispered
wolsey
she
shall
be
removed
said
henry
in
that
case
i
am
content
to
smother
my
feelings
said
the
queen
come
then
kate
said
henry
taking
her
hand
lord
cardinal
you
will
attend
right
gladly
my
liege
replied
wolsey
if
this
mood
will
only
endure
he
muttered
all
will
go
well
but
his
jealousy
must
not
be
allowed
to
cool
would
that
wyat
were
here
doctor
sampson
could
scarcely
credit
his
senses
as
he
beheld
the
august
pair
come
forth
together
and
a
word
from
wolsey
explaining
what
had
occurred
threw
him
into
transports
of
delight
but
the
surprise
of
the
good
canon
was
nothing
to
that
exhibited
as
henry
and
catherine
entered
the
royal
lodgings
and
the
king
ordered
his
own
apartments
to
be
instantly
prepared
for
her
majesty
reception
xi
how
tristram
lyndwood
and
mabel
were
liberated
intelligence
of
the
queen
return
was
instantly
conveyed
to
anne
boleyn
and
filled
her
with
indescribable
alarm
all
her
visions
of
power
and
splendour
seemed
to
melt
away
at
once
she
sent
for
her
father
lord
rochford
who
hurried
to
her
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
anxiety
and
closely
questioned
her
whether
the
extraordinary
change
had
not
been
occasioned
by
some
imprudence
of
her
own
but
she
positively
denied
the
charge
alleging
that
she
had
parted
with
the
king
scarcely
an
hour
before
on
terms
of
the
most
perfect
amity
and
with
the
full
conviction
that
she
had
accomplished
the
cardinal
ruin
you
should
not
have
put
forth
your
hand
against
him
till
you
were
sure
of
striking
the
blow
said
rochford
there
is
no
telling
what
secret
influence
he
has
over
the
king
and
there
may
yet
be
a
hard
battle
to
fight
but
not
a
moment
must
be
lost
in
counteracting
his
operations
luckily
suffolk
is
here
and
his
enmity
to
the
cardinal
will
make
him
a
sure
friend
to
us
pray
heaven
you
have
not
given
the
king
fresh
occasion
for
jealousy
that
is
all
i
and
quitting
his
daughter
he
sought
out
suffolk
who
alarmed
at
what
appeared
like
a
restoration
of
wolsey
to
favour
promised
heartily
to
with
him
in
the
struggle
and
that
no
time
might
be
lost
the
duke
proceeded
at
once
to
the
royal
closet
where
he
found
the
king
pacing
moodily
to
and
fro
your
majesty
seems
disturbed
said
the
duke
disturbed
ay
exclaimed
the
king
i
have
enough
to
disturb
me
i
will
never
love
again
i
will
forswear
the
whole
sex
harkee
suffolk
you
are
my
brother
my
second
self
and
know
all
the
secrets
of
my
heart
after
the
passionate
devotion
i
have
displayed
for
anne
boleyn
after
all
i
have
done
for
her
all
i
have
risked
for
her
i
have
been
impossible
my
liege
exclaimed
suffolk
why
so
i
thought
cried
henry
and
i
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
all
insinuations
thrown
out
against
her
till
proof
was
afforded
which
i
could
no
longer
and
what
was
the
amount
of
the
proof
my
liege
asked
suffolk
these
letters
said
henry
handing
them
to
him
found
on
the
person
of
sir
thomas
but
these
only
prove
my
liege
the
existence
of
a
former
passion
nothing
more
remarked
suffolk
after
he
had
scanned
them
but
she
vows
eternal
constancy
to
him
cried
henry
says
she
shall
ever
love
him
says
so
at
the
time
she
professes
devoted
love
for
me
how
can
i
trust
her
after
that
suffolk
i
feel
she
does
not
love
me
exclusively
and
my
passion
is
so
deep
and
devouring
that
it
demands
entire
return
i
must
have
her
heart
as
well
as
her
person
and
i
feel
i
have
only
won
her
in
my
quality
of
i
am
persuaded
your
majesty
is
mistaken
said
the
duke
would
i
could
think
so
sighed
henry
but
no
no
i
can
not
be
deceived
i
will
conquer
this
fatal
passion
oh
suffolk
it
is
frightful
to
be
the
bondslave
of
a
woman
a
fickle
inconstant
woman
but
between
the
depths
of
love
and
hate
is
but
a
step
and
i
can
pass
from
one
to
the
do
nothing
rashly
my
dear
liege
said
suffolk
nothing
that
may
bring
with
it
do
not
be
swayed
by
those
who
have
inflamed
your
jealousy
and
who
could
practise
upon
it
think
the
matter
calmly
over
and
then
act
and
till
you
have
decided
see
neither
catherine
nor
anne
and
above
all
do
not
admit
wolsey
to
your
secret
you
are
his
enemy
suffolk
said
the
king
sternly
i
am
your
majesty
friend
replied
the
duke
i
beseech
you
yield
to
me
on
this
occasion
and
i
am
sure
of
your
thanks
well
i
believe
you
are
right
my
good
friend
and
brother
said
henry
and
i
will
curb
my
impulses
of
rage
and
jealousy
before
i
see
either
the
queen
or
anne
we
will
ride
forth
into
the
forest
and
talk
the
matter
further
your
highness
has
come
to
a
wise
determination
said
the
duke
oh
suffolk
sighed
henry
would
i
had
never
seen
this
siren
she
exercises
a
fearful
control
over
me
and
enslaves
my
very
i
can
not
say
whether
it
is
for
good
or
ill
that
you
have
met
my
dear
liege
replied
suffolk
but
i
fancy
i
can
discern
the
way
in
which
your
ultimate
decision
will
be
taken
but
it
is
now
near
midnight
i
wish
your
majesty
sound
and
untroubled
stay
cried
henry
i
am
about
to
visit
the
curfew
tower
and
must
take
you
with
me
i
will
explain
my
errand
as
we
go
i
had
some
thought
of
sending
you
there
in
my
stead
ha
he
exclaimed
glancing
at
his
finger
by
saint
paul
it
is
gone
what
is
gone
my
liege
asked
suffolk
my
signet
replied
henry
i
missed
it
not
till
now
it
has
been
wrested
from
me
by
the
fiend
during
my
walk
from
the
curfew
tower
let
us
not
lose
a
moment
or
the
prisoners
will
be
set
free
by
him
if
they
have
not
been
liberated
so
saying
he
took
a
couple
of
dags
a
species
of
short
gun
from
a
rest
on
the
wall
and
giving
one
to
suffolk
thrust
the
other
into
his
girdle
thus
armed
they
quitted
the
royal
lodgings
and
hurried
in
the
direction
of
the
curfew
tower
just
as
they
reached
the
horseshoe
cloisters
the
began
to
ring
did
i
not
tell
you
so
cried
henry
furiously
they
have
escaped
ha
it
ceases
what
has
happened
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
king
had
quitted
the
curfew
tower
a
tall
man
enveloped
in
a
cloak
and
wearing
a
high
conical
cap
presented
himself
to
the
arquebusier
stationed
at
the
entrance
to
the
dungeon
and
desired
to
be
admitted
to
the
prisoners
i
have
the
king
signet
he
said
holding
forth
the
ring
on
seeing
this
the
arquebusier
who
recognised
the
ring
unlocked
the
door
and
admitted
him
mabel
was
kneeling
on
the
ground
beside
her
grandsire
with
her
hands
raised
as
in
prayer
but
as
the
tall
man
entered
the
vault
she
started
to
her
feet
and
uttered
a
slight
scream
what
is
the
matter
child
cried
he
is
here
he
is
come
cried
mabel
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
terror
who
the
king
cried
tristram
looking
up
ah
i
see
herne
is
come
to
deliver
do
not
go
with
him
grandsire
cried
mabel
in
the
name
of
all
the
saints
i
implore
you
do
silence
her
said
herne
in
a
harsh
imperious
voice
or
i
leave
the
old
man
looked
imploringly
at
his
granddaughter
you
know
the
conditions
of
your
liberation
said
herne
i
do
i
do
replied
tristram
hastily
and
with
a
shudder
oh
grandfather
cried
mabel
falling
at
his
feet
do
not
i
conjure
you
make
any
conditions
with
this
dreaded
being
or
it
will
be
at
the
expense
of
your
salvation
better
i
should
perish
at
the
stake
better
you
should
suffer
the
most
ignominious
death
than
this
should
do
you
accept
them
cried
herne
disregarding
her
supplications
tristram
answered
in
the
affirmative
recall
your
words
grandfather
recall
your
words
cried
mabel
i
will
implore
pardon
for
you
on
my
knees
from
the
king
and
he
will
not
refuse
the
pledge
can
not
be
recalled
damsel
said
herne
and
it
is
to
save
you
from
the
king
as
much
as
to
accomplish
his
own
preservation
that
your
grandsire
consents
he
would
not
have
you
a
victim
to
and
as
he
spoke
he
divided
the
forester
bonds
with
his
knife
you
must
go
with
him
mabel
he
added
i
will
not
she
cried
something
warns
me
that
a
great
danger
awaits
you
must
go
girl
cried
tristram
angrily
i
will
not
leave
you
to
henry
lawless
meanwhile
herne
had
passed
into
one
of
the
large
embrasures
and
opened
by
means
of
a
spring
an
entrance
to
a
secret
staircase
in
the
wall
he
then
beckoned
tristram
towards
him
and
whispered
some
instructions
in
his
ear
i
understand
replied
the
old
man
proceed
to
the
cave
cried
herne
and
remain
there
till
i
join
tristram
nodded
assent
come
mabel
he
cried
advancing
towards
her
and
seizing
her
hand
away
cried
herne
in
a
menacing
tone
terrified
by
the
formidable
looks
and
gestures
of
the
demon
the
poor
girl
offered
no
resistance
and
her
grandfather
drew
her
into
the
opening
which
was
immediately
closed
after
her
about
an
hour
after
this
and
when
it
was
near
upon
the
stroke
of
midnight
the
arquebusier
who
had
admitted
the
tall
stranger
to
the
dungeon
and
who
had
momentarily
expected
his
coming
forth
opened
the
door
to
see
what
was
going
forward
great
was
his
astonishment
to
find
the
cell
empty
after
looking
around
in
bewilderment
he
rushed
to
the
chamber
above
to
tell
his
comrades
what
had
happened
this
is
clearly
the
work
of
the
fiend
said
shoreditch
it
is
useless
to
strive
against
that
tall
black
man
was
doubtless
herne
said
paddington
i
am
glad
he
did
us
no
injury
i
hope
the
king
will
not
provoke
his
malice
well
we
must
inform
captain
bouchier
of
the
mischance
said
shoreditch
i
would
not
be
in
thy
skin
mat
bee
for
a
trifle
the
king
will
be
here
presently
and
then
it
is
impossible
to
penetrate
through
the
devices
of
the
evil
one
interrupted
mat
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
the
royal
signet
for
i
saw
it
on
the
king
finger
as
he
delivered
the
order
i
wish
such
another
chance
of
capturing
the
fiend
would
occur
to
as
the
words
were
uttered
the
door
of
a
recess
was
thrown
suddenly
open
and
herne
in
his
wild
garb
with
his
antlered
helm
upon
his
brow
and
the
rusty
chain
depending
from
his
left
arm
stood
before
them
his
appearance
was
so
terrific
and
unearthly
that
they
all
shrank
aghast
and
mat
bee
fell
with
his
face
on
the
floor
i
am
here
cried
the
demon
now
braggart
wilt
dare
to
seize
me
but
not
a
hand
was
moved
against
him
the
whole
party
seemed
transfixed
with
terror
you
dare
not
brave
my
power
and
you
are
right
cried
herne
a
wave
of
my
hand
would
bring
this
old
tower
about
your
ears
a
word
would
summon
a
legion
of
fiends
to
torment
but
do
not
utter
it
i
pray
you
good
herne
excellent
herne
cried
mat
bee
and
above
all
things
do
not
wave
your
hand
for
we
have
no
desire
to
be
buried
alive
have
we
comrades
i
should
never
have
said
what
i
did
if
i
had
thought
your
friendship
within
your
royal
master
will
as
vainly
seek
to
contend
with
me
as
he
did
to
bury
me
beneath
the
cried
herne
if
you
want
me
further
seek
me
in
the
upper
and
with
these
words
he
darted
up
the
flight
of
steps
and
disappeared
as
soon
as
they
recovered
from
the
fright
that
had
enchained
them
shoreditch
and
paddington
rushed
forth
into
the
area
in
front
of
the
turret
and
shouting
to
those
on
the
roof
told
them
that
herne
was
in
the
upper
room
a
piece
of
information
which
was
altogether
superfluous
as
the
hammering
had
recommenced
and
continued
till
the
clock
struck
twelve
when
it
stopped
just
then
it
occurred
to
mat
bee
to
ring
the
and
he
seized
the
rope
and
began
to
pull
it
but
the
bell
had
scarcely
sounded
when
the
cord
severed
from
above
fell
upon
his
head
at
this
juncture
the
king
and
the
duke
of
suffolk
arrived
when
told
what
had
happened
though
prepared
for
it
henry
burst
into
a
terrible
passion
and
bestowed
a
buffet
on
mat
bee
that
well
nigh
broke
his
jaw
and
sent
him
reeling
to
the
farther
side
of
the
chamber
he
had
not
at
first
understood
that
herne
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
upper
room
but
as
soon
as
he
was
made
aware
of
the
circumstance
he
cried
out
ah
dastards
have
you
let
him
brave
you
thus
but
i
am
glad
of
it
his
capture
is
reserved
for
my
own
do
not
expose
yourself
to
this
risk
my
gracious
liege
said
suffolk
what
are
you
too
a
sharer
in
their
womanish
fears
suffolk
cried
henry
i
thought
you
had
been
made
of
stouter
stuff
if
there
is
danger
i
shall
be
the
first
to
encounter
it
come
he
added
snatching
a
torch
from
an
arquebusier
and
drawing
his
dag
he
hurried
up
the
steep
steps
while
suffolk
followed
his
example
and
three
or
four
arquebusiers
ventured
after
them
meanwhile
shoreditch
and
paddington
ran
out
and
informed
bouchier
that
the
king
had
arrived
and
was
mounting
in
search
of
herne
upon
which
the
captain
shaking
off
his
fears
ordered
his
men
to
follow
him
and
opening
the
little
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
began
cautiously
to
descend
feeling
his
way
with
his
sword
he
had
got
about
down
when
henry
sprang
upon
the
platform
the
light
of
the
torch
fell
upon
the
ghostly
figure
of
herne
with
his
arms
folded
upon
his
breast
standing
near
the
pile
of
wood
lying
between
the
two
staircases
so
appalling
was
the
appearance
of
the
demon
that
henry
stood
still
to
gaze
at
him
while
bouchier
and
his
men
remained
irresolute
on
the
stairs
in
another
moment
the
duke
of
suffolk
had
gained
the
platform
and
the
arquebusiers
were
seen
near
the
head
of
the
stairs
at
last
thou
art
in
my
power
accursed
being
cried
henry
thou
art
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
and
canst
not
escape
ho
ho
ho
laughed
herne
this
shall
prove
whether
thou
art
human
or
not
cried
henry
taking
deliberate
aim
at
him
with
the
dag
ho
ho
ho
laughed
herne
and
as
the
report
rang
through
the
room
he
sank
through
the
floor
and
disappeared
from
view
gone
exclaimed
henry
as
the
smoke
cleared
off
gone
holy
mary
then
it
must
indeed
be
the
fiend
i
made
the
middle
of
his
skull
my
aim
and
if
he
had
not
been
invulnerable
the
bullet
must
have
pierced
his
brain
i
heard
it
rebound
from
his
horned
helmet
and
drop
to
the
floor
said
bouchier
what
is
that
chest
cried
henry
pointing
to
a
strange
box
lying
as
it
seemed
on
the
exact
spot
where
the
demon
had
disappeared
no
one
had
seen
it
before
though
all
called
to
mind
the
mysterious
hammering
and
they
had
no
doubt
that
the
coffin
was
the
work
of
the
demon
break
it
open
cried
henry
for
aught
we
know
herne
may
be
concealed
within
the
order
was
reluctantly
obeyed
by
the
arquebusiers
but
no
force
was
required
for
the
lid
was
not
nailed
down
and
when
it
was
removed
a
human
body
in
the
last
stage
of
decay
was
discovered
pah
close
it
up
cried
henry
turning
away
in
disgust
how
came
it
there
it
must
have
been
brought
by
the
powers
of
darkness
said
bouchier
no
such
coffin
was
here
when
i
searched
the
chamber
two
hours
ago
but
see
he
suddenly
added
stooping
down
and
picking
up
a
piece
of
paper
which
had
fallen
from
the
coffin
here
is
a
give
it
me
cried
henry
and
holding
it
to
the
light
he
read
the
words
the
body
of
mark
fytton
the
butcher
the
victim
of
a
uttering
a
terrible
imprecation
henry
flung
the
paper
from
him
and
bidding
the
arquebusiers
burn
the
body
at
the
foot
of
the
gallows
without
the
town
he
quitted
the
tower
without
further
search
xii
how
wolsey
was
disgraced
by
the
king
on
the
following
day
a
reconciliation
took
place
between
the
king
and
anne
boleyn
during
a
ride
in
the
great
park
with
his
royal
brother
suffolk
not
only
convinced
him
of
the
groundlessness
of
his
jealousy
but
contrived
to
incense
him
strongly
against
wolsey
thus
the
queen
and
the
cardinal
lost
the
momentary
advantage
they
had
gained
while
power
was
raised
yet
higher
yielding
to
her
entreaties
not
to
see
catherine
again
nor
to
hold
further
conference
with
wolsey
until
the
sentence
of
the
court
should
be
pronounced
henry
left
the
castle
that
very
day
and
proceeded
to
his
palace
of
bridewell
the
distress
of
the
unhappy
queen
at
this
sudden
revolution
of
affairs
may
be
conceived
distrusting
wolsey
and
putting
her
sole
reliance
on
heaven
and
the
goodness
of
her
cause
she
withdrew
to
blackfriars
where
she
remained
till
the
court
met
as
to
the
cardinal
himself
driven
desperate
by
his
situation
and
exasperated
by
the
treatment
he
had
experienced
he
resolved
at
whatever
risk
to
thwart
henry
schemes
and
revenge
himself
upon
anne
boleyn
thus
matters
continued
till
the
court
met
as
before
in
the
at
blackfriars
on
this
occasion
henry
was
present
and
took
his
place
under
a
cloth
of
estate
the
queen
sitting
at
some
distance
below
him
opposite
them
were
the
legates
with
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
the
whole
of
the
bishops
the
aspect
of
the
assemblage
was
grave
and
anxious
many
eyes
were
turned
on
henry
who
looked
gloomy
and
menacing
but
the
chief
object
of
interest
was
the
queen
who
though
pale
as
death
had
never
in
her
highest
days
of
power
worn
a
more
majestic
and
dignified
air
than
on
this
occasion
the
proceedings
of
the
court
then
commenced
and
the
king
being
called
by
the
crier
he
immediately
answered
to
the
summons
catherine
was
next
called
and
instead
of
replying
she
marched
towards
the
canopy
beneath
which
the
king
was
seated
prostrated
herself
and
poured
forth
a
most
pathetic
and
eloquent
appeal
to
him
at
the
close
of
which
she
arose
and
making
a
profound
reverence
walked
out
of
the
court
leaning
upon
the
arm
of
her
general
receiver
griffith
henry
desired
the
crier
to
call
her
back
but
she
would
not
return
and
seeing
the
effect
produced
by
her
address
upon
the
auditory
he
endeavoured
to
efface
it
by
an
eulogium
on
her
character
and
virtues
accompanied
by
an
expression
of
deep
regret
at
the
step
he
was
compelled
to
take
in
separating
himself
from
her
but
his
hypocrisy
availed
him
little
and
his
speech
was
received
with
looks
of
incredulity
some
further
discourse
then
took
place
between
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
the
bishop
of
rochester
but
as
the
queen
had
absented
herself
the
court
was
adjourned
to
the
next
day
when
it
again
met
and
as
she
did
not
then
appear
though
summoned
she
was
pronounced
contumacious
after
repeated
adjournments
the
last
session
was
held
and
judgment
demanded
on
the
part
of
the
king
when
campeggio
as
had
been
arranged
between
him
and
wolsey
declined
to
pronounce
it
until
he
had
referred
the
matter
to
the
pope
and
the
court
was
dissolved
about
two
months
after
this
event
during
which
time
the
commission
had
been
revoked
while
henry
was
revolving
the
expediency
of
accomplishing
the
divorce
through
the
medium
of
his
own
ecclesiastical
courts
and
without
reference
to
that
of
rome
a
despatch
was
received
from
the
pope
by
the
two
cardinals
requiring
them
to
cite
the
king
to
appear
before
him
by
attorney
on
a
certain
day
at
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
this
instrument
campeggio
chanced
to
be
staying
with
wolsey
at
his
palace
at
esher
and
as
the
king
was
then
holding
his
court
at
windsor
they
both
set
out
for
the
castle
on
the
following
day
attended
by
a
retinue
of
nearly
a
hundred
horsemen
splendidly
equipped
it
was
now
the
middle
of
september
and
the
woods
instead
of
presenting
one
uniform
mass
of
green
glowed
with
an
infinite
variety
of
lovely
tints
and
yet
despite
the
beauty
of
the
scene
there
was
something
melancholy
in
witnessing
the
decline
of
the
year
as
marked
by
those
old
woods
and
by
the
paths
that
led
through
them
so
thickly
strewn
with
leaves
wolsey
was
greatly
affected
these
noble
trees
will
ere
long
bereft
of
all
their
glories
he
thought
and
so
most
likely
will
it
be
with
me
and
perhaps
my
winter
may
come
sooner
than
theirs
the
cardinal
and
his
train
had
crossed
staines
bridge
and
passing
through
egham
had
entered
the
great
park
near
englefield
green
they
were
proceeding
along
the
high
ridge
overlooking
the
woody
region
between
it
and
the
castle
when
a
joyous
shout
in
the
glades
beneath
reached
them
and
looking
down
they
saw
the
king
accompanied
by
anne
boleyn
and
attended
by
his
falconers
and
a
large
company
of
horsemen
pursuing
the
sport
of
hawking
the
royal
party
appeared
so
much
interested
in
their
sport
that
they
did
not
notice
the
cardinal
and
his
train
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
but
as
wolsey
descended
snow
hill
and
entered
the
long
avenue
he
heard
the
trampling
of
horses
at
a
little
distance
and
shortly
afterwards
henry
and
anne
issued
from
out
the
trees
they
were
somewhat
more
than
a
in
advance
of
the
cardinal
but
instead
of
halting
till
he
came
up
the
king
had
no
sooner
ascertained
who
it
was
than
despatching
a
messenger
to
the
castle
who
was
seen
galloping
swiftly
down
the
avenue
he
rode
off
with
anne
boleyn
towards
the
opposite
side
of
the
park
though
deeply
mortified
by
the
slight
wolsey
concealed
his
vexation
from
his
brother
cardinal
and
pursued
his
way
to
the
castle
before
which
he
presently
arrived
the
gate
was
thrown
open
at
his
approach
but
he
had
scarcely
entered
the
lower
ward
when
sir
henry
norris
the
king
groom
of
the
stole
advanced
to
meet
him
and
with
a
sorrowful
expression
of
countenance
said
that
his
royal
master
had
so
many
guests
at
the
castle
that
he
could
not
accommodate
him
and
his
train
i
understand
your
drift
sir
replied
wolsey
you
would
tell
me
i
am
not
welcome
well
then
his
eminence
cardinal
campeggio
and
myself
must
take
up
our
lodging
at
some
hostel
in
the
town
for
it
is
necessary
we
should
see
the
if
your
grace
is
content
to
dismiss
your
attendants
said
norris
in
a
low
tone
you
and
cardinal
campeggio
can
be
lodged
in
henry
the
tower
thus
much
i
will
take
upon
me
but
i
dare
not
admit
you
to
the
royal
wolsey
tried
to
look
unconcerned
and
calling
to
his
gentleman
usher
george
cavendish
gave
him
some
instructions
in
a
low
voice
upon
which
the
other
immediately
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
retinue
and
ordered
them
to
quit
the
castle
with
him
leaving
only
the
jester
patch
to
attend
upon
his
master
campeggio
attendants
being
comparatively
speaking
few
in
number
were
allowed
to
remain
and
his
litter
was
conveyed
to
henry
the
third
tower
a
fortification
standing
as
already
stated
in
the
south
side
of
the
lower
ward
near
the
edge
of
the
dry
moat
surrounding
the
round
tower
at
the
steps
of
this
tower
wolsey
dismounted
and
was
about
to
follow
campeggio
into
the
doorway
when
will
sommers
who
had
heard
of
his
arrival
stepped
forward
and
with
a
salutation
of
mock
formality
said
i
am
sure
it
will
grieve
the
king
my
master
not
to
be
able
to
accommodate
your
grace
train
but
since
it
is
larger
than
his
own
you
will
scarce
blame
his
want
of
nor
the
courtesy
of
his
attendants
rejoined
wolsey
sharply
i
am
in
no
mood
for
thy
jesting
now
stand
aside
sirrah
or
i
will
have
the
rod
applied
to
thy
back
take
care
the
king
does
not
apply
the
rod
to
your
own
lord
cardinal
retorted
will
sommers
if
he
scourges
you
according
to
your
deserts
your
skin
will
be
redder
than
your
and
his
mocking
laugh
pursued
wolsey
like
the
hiss
of
a
snake
into
the
tower
some
two
hours
after
this
henry
and
his
attendants
returned
from
the
chase
the
king
seemed
in
a
blithe
humour
and
wolsey
saw
him
laugh
heartily
as
will
sommers
pointed
with
his
bauble
towards
henry
the
third
tower
the
cardinal
received
no
invitation
to
the
royal
banquet
and
the
answer
to
his
solicitation
for
an
interview
was
that
he
and
campeggio
would
be
received
in
the
on
the
following
morning
but
not
before
that
night
a
great
revel
was
held
in
the
castle
masquing
dancing
and
feasting
filled
up
the
evening
and
the
joyous
sounds
and
strains
reached
wolsey
in
his
seclusion
and
forced
him
to
contrast
it
with
his
recent
position
when
he
would
have
been
second
only
to
the
king
in
the
entertainment
he
laid
his
head
upon
his
pillow
but
not
to
rest
and
while
tossing
feverishly
about
his
couch
he
saw
the
arras
with
which
the
walls
were
covered
move
and
a
tall
dark
figure
step
from
behind
it
the
cardinal
would
have
awakened
his
jester
who
slept
in
a
small
at
his
feet
but
the
strange
visitor
motioned
him
to
be
still
you
may
conjecture
who
i
am
cardinal
he
said
but
in
case
you
should
doubt
i
will
tell
you
i
am
herne
the
hunter
and
now
to
my
errand
there
is
a
damsel
whom
you
once
saw
in
the
forest
near
the
great
lake
and
whom
you
promised
to
befriend
you
can
assist
her
now
it
may
be
out
of
your
i
have
enough
to
do
to
aid
myself
without
meddling
with
what
concerns
me
not
said
wolsey
this
damsel
does
concern
you
cried
herne
read
this
and
you
will
see
in
what
and
he
tossed
a
letter
to
wolsey
who
glanced
at
it
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
ha
is
it
so
he
exclaimed
is
she
hush
cried
herne
or
you
will
wake
this
sleeper
it
is
as
you
suppose
will
you
not
aid
her
now
will
you
not
bestow
some
of
your
treasure
upon
her
before
it
is
wholly
wrested
from
you
by
the
king
i
will
do
aught
you
wish
secretly
and
go
then
to
my
palace
at
esher
cried
the
cardinal
take
this
key
to
my
treasurer
it
is
the
key
of
my
coffers
bid
him
deliver
to
you
the
six
caskets
in
the
cabinet
in
the
gilt
chamber
here
is
a
token
by
which
he
will
know
that
you
came
from
me
he
added
delivering
him
a
small
chain
of
gold
for
it
has
been
so
agreed
between
us
but
you
will
be
sure
to
give
the
treasure
to
fear
nothing
replied
herne
and
stretching
forth
his
hand
to
receive
the
key
and
the
chain
he
glided
behind
the
tapestry
and
disappeared
this
strange
incident
gave
some
diversion
to
wolsey
thought
but
ere
long
they
returned
to
their
former
channel
sleep
would
not
be
summoned
and
as
soon
as
the
first
glimpse
of
day
appeared
he
arose
and
wrapping
his
robe
around
him
left
his
room
and
ascended
a
winding
staircase
leading
to
the
roof
of
the
tower
the
morning
promised
to
be
fine
but
it
was
then
hazy
and
the
greater
part
of
the
forest
was
wrapped
in
mist
the
castle
however
was
seen
to
great
advantage
above
wolsey
rose
the
vast
fabric
of
the
round
tower
on
the
summit
of
which
the
broad
standard
was
at
that
moment
being
unfurled
while
the
different
battlements
and
towers
arose
majestically
around
but
wolsey
gaze
rested
chiefly
upon
the
exquisite
mausoleum
lying
immediately
beneath
him
in
which
he
had
partly
prepared
for
himself
a
magnificent
monument
a
sharp
pang
shook
him
as
he
contemplated
it
and
he
cried
aloud
my
very
tomb
will
be
wrested
from
me
by
this
rapacious
monarch
and
after
all
my
care
and
all
my
cost
i
know
not
where
i
shall
rest
my
bones
saddened
by
the
reflection
he
descended
to
his
chamber
and
again
threw
himself
on
the
couch
but
wolsey
was
not
the
only
person
in
the
castle
who
had
passed
a
sleepless
night
of
the
host
of
his
enemies
many
had
been
kept
awake
by
the
anticipation
of
his
downfall
on
the
morrow
and
among
these
was
anne
boleyn
who
had
received
an
assurance
from
the
king
that
her
enmity
should
at
length
be
fully
gratified
at
the
appointed
hour
the
two
cardinals
proceeded
to
the
royal
lodgings
they
were
detained
for
some
time
in
the
where
wolsey
was
exposed
to
the
taunts
and
sneers
of
the
courtiers
who
had
lately
so
servilely
fawned
upon
him
at
length
they
were
ushered
into
the
presence
chamber
at
the
upper
end
of
which
beneath
a
canopy
emblazoned
with
the
royal
arms
woven
in
gold
sat
henry
with
anne
boleyn
on
his
right
hand
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
stood
will
sommers
and
near
him
the
dukes
of
richmond
and
suffolk
norfolk
rochford
and
a
number
of
other
nobles
all
open
enemies
of
wolsey
were
also
present
henry
watched
the
advance
of
the
cardinals
with
a
stern
look
and
after
they
had
made
an
obeisance
to
him
he
motioned
them
to
rise
you
have
sought
an
interview
with
me
my
lords
he
said
with
suppressed
rage
what
would
you
we
have
brought
an
instrument
to
you
my
liege
said
wolsey
which
has
just
been
received
from
his
holiness
the
declare
its
nature
said
henry
it
is
a
citation
replied
wolsey
enjoining
your
high
ness
to
appear
by
attorney
in
the
papal
court
under
a
penalty
of
ten
thousand
and
he
presented
a
parchment
stamped
with
the
great
seal
of
rome
to
the
king
who
glanced
his
eye
fiercely
over
it
and
then
dashed
it
to
the
ground
with
an
explosion
of
fury
terrible
to
hear
and
to
witness
ha
by
saint
george
he
cried
am
i
as
nothing
that
the
pope
dares
to
insult
me
thus
it
is
a
mere
judicial
form
your
majesty
interposed
campeggio
and
is
chiefly
sent
by
his
holiness
to
let
you
know
we
have
no
further
jurisdiction
in
the
matter
of
the
i
will
take
care
you
have
not
nor
his
holiness
either
roared
the
king
by
my
father
head
he
shall
find
i
will
be
no
longer
trifled
but
my
liege
cried
campeggio
peace
cried
the
king
i
will
hear
no
apologies
nor
excuses
the
insult
has
been
offered
and
can
not
be
effaced
as
for
you
wolsey
sire
exclaimed
the
cardinal
shrinking
before
the
whirlwind
of
passion
which
seemed
to
menace
his
utter
extermination
as
for
you
i
say
pursued
henry
extending
his
hand
towards
him
while
his
eyes
flashed
fire
who
by
your
outrageous
pride
have
so
long
overshadowed
our
honour
who
by
your
insatiate
avarice
and
appetite
for
wealth
have
oppressed
our
subjects
who
by
your
manifold
acts
of
bribery
and
extortion
have
impoverished
our
realm
and
by
your
cruelty
and
partiality
have
subverted
the
due
course
of
justice
and
turned
it
to
your
ends
the
time
is
come
when
you
shall
receive
due
punishment
for
your
you
wrong
me
my
dear
liege
cried
wolsey
abjectly
these
are
the
accusations
of
my
enemies
grant
me
a
patient
hearing
and
i
will
explain
i
would
not
sharpen
the
king
resentment
against
you
lord
cardinal
said
anne
boleyn
for
it
is
keen
enough
but
i
can
not
permit
you
to
say
that
these
charges
are
merely
hostile
those
who
would
support
the
king
honour
and
dignity
must
desire
to
see
you
removed
from
his
i
am
ready
to
take
thy
place
lord
cardinal
said
will
sommers
and
will
exchange
my
bauble
for
thy
chancellor
mace
and
my
fool
cap
for
thy
cardinal
peace
thundered
the
king
stand
not
between
me
and
the
object
of
my
wrath
your
accusers
are
not
one
but
many
wolsey
nay
the
whole
of
my
people
cry
out
for
justice
against
you
and
they
shall
have
it
but
you
shall
hear
the
charges
they
bring
firstly
contrary
to
our
prerogative
and
for
your
own
advancement
and
profit
you
have
obtained
authority
legatine
from
the
pope
by
which
authority
you
have
not
only
spoiled
and
taken
away
their
substance
from
many
religious
houses
but
have
usurped
much
of
our
own
jurisdiction
you
have
also
made
a
treaty
with
the
king
of
france
for
the
pope
without
our
consent
and
concluded
another
friendly
treaty
with
the
duke
of
ferrara
under
our
great
seal
and
in
our
name
without
our
warrant
and
furthermore
you
have
presumed
to
couple
yourself
with
our
royal
self
in
your
letters
and
instructions
as
if
you
were
on
an
equality
with
ha
ha
king
and
i
would
have
you
do
thus
king
and
i
give
you
our
hearty
thanks
ran
it
not
so
cardinal
cried
will
sommers
you
will
soon
win
the
cap
and
in
exercise
of
your
legatine
authority
pursued
the
king
you
have
given
away
benefices
contrary
to
our
crown
and
dignity
for
the
which
you
are
in
danger
of
forfeiture
of
your
lands
and
a
premunire
cardinal
cried
will
sommers
a
premunire
ha
ha
then
it
has
been
your
practice
to
receive
all
the
ambassadors
to
our
court
first
at
your
own
palace
continued
henry
to
hear
their
charges
and
intentions
and
to
instruct
them
as
you
might
see
fit
you
have
also
so
practised
that
all
our
letters
sent
from
beyond
sea
have
first
come
to
your
own
hands
by
which
you
have
acquainted
yourself
with
their
contents
and
compelled
us
and
our
council
to
follow
your
devices
you
have
also
written
to
all
our
ambassadors
abroad
in
your
own
name
concerning
our
affairs
without
our
authority
and
received
letters
in
return
from
them
by
which
you
have
sought
to
compass
your
own
purposes
by
your
ambition
and
pride
you
have
undone
many
of
our
poor
subjects
have
suppressed
religious
houses
and
received
their
possessions
have
seized
upon
the
goods
of
wealthy
spiritual
men
deceased
constrained
all
ordinaries
yearly
to
compound
with
you
have
gotten
riches
for
yourself
and
servants
by
subversion
of
the
laws
and
by
abuse
of
your
authority
in
causing
divers
pardons
of
the
pope
to
be
suspended
until
you
by
promise
of
a
yearly
pension
chose
to
revive
them
and
also
by
crafty
and
untrue
tales
have
sought
to
create
dissention
among
our
that
we
can
all
avouch
for
cried
suffolk
it
was
never
merry
in
england
while
there
were
cardinals
among
of
all
men
in
england
your
grace
should
be
the
last
to
say
so
rejoined
wolsey
for
if
i
had
not
been
cardinal
you
would
not
have
had
a
head
upon
your
shoulders
to
utter
the
no
more
of
this
cried
the
king
you
have
misdemeaned
yourself
in
our
court
by
keeping
up
as
great
state
in
our
absence
as
if
we
had
been
there
in
person
and
presumptuously
have
dared
to
join
and
imprint
your
badge
the
cardinal
hat
under
our
arms
graven
on
our
coins
struck
at
york
and
lastly
whenever
in
open
parliament
allusion
hath
been
made
to
heresies
and
erroneous
sects
you
have
failed
to
correct
and
notice
them
to
the
danger
of
the
whole
body
of
good
and
christian
people
of
this
our
this
last
charge
ought
to
win
me
favour
in
the
eyes
of
one
who
professes
the
opinions
of
luther
said
wolsey
to
anne
but
i
deny
it
as
i
do
all
the
i
will
listen
to
no
defence
wolsey
replied
the
king
i
will
make
you
a
terrible
example
to
others
how
they
offend
us
and
our
laws
do
not
condemn
me
unheard
cried
the
cardinal
prostrating
himself
i
have
heard
too
much
and
i
will
hear
no
more
cried
the
king
fiercely
i
dismiss
you
from
my
presence
for
ever
if
you
are
innocent
as
you
aver
justice
will
be
done
if
you
are
guilty
as
i
believe
you
to
be
look
not
for
leniency
from
me
for
i
will
show
you
and
seating
himself
he
turned
to
anne
and
said
in
a
low
tone
are
you
content
sweetheart
i
am
she
replied
i
shall
not
now
break
my
vow
false
cardinal
she
added
aloud
your
reign
is
at
an
your
own
may
not
be
much
longer
madam
rejoined
wolsey
bitterly
the
shadow
of
the
axe
he
added
pointing
to
the
reflection
of
a
partisan
on
the
floor
is
at
your
feet
ere
long
it
may
rise
to
the
and
accompanied
by
campeggio
he
slowly
quitted
the
thus
ends
the
fourth
book
of
the
chronicle
of
windsor
castle
book
mabel
lyndwood
i
how
the
earl
of
surrey
and
the
fair
geraldine
met
in
king
james
bower
in
the
moat
and
how
they
were
surprised
by
the
duke
of
richmond
in
order
to
preserve
unbroken
the
chain
of
events
with
which
the
last
book
of
this
chronicle
concluded
it
was
deemed
expedient
to
disturb
the
unity
of
time
so
far
as
it
related
to
some
of
the
less
important
characters
and
it
will
now
be
necessary
therefore
to
return
to
the
middle
of
june
when
the
earl
of
surrey
term
of
captivity
was
drawing
to
a
close
as
the
best
means
of
conquering
the
anxiety
produced
by
the
vision
exhibited
to
him
by
herne
increased
as
it
was
by
the
loss
of
the
relic
he
had
sustained
at
the
same
time
the
earl
had
devoted
himself
to
incessant
study
and
for
a
whole
month
he
remained
within
his
chamber
the
consequence
of
his
unremitting
application
was
that
though
he
succeeded
in
his
design
and
completely
regained
his
tranquillity
his
strength
gave
way
under
the
effort
and
he
was
confined
for
some
days
to
his
couch
by
a
low
fever
as
soon
as
he
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
venture
forth
he
mounted
to
the
summit
of
the
round
tower
in
the
hope
that
a
walk
round
its
breezy
battlements
might
conduce
to
his
restoration
to
health
the
day
was
bright
and
beautiful
and
a
gentle
wind
was
stirring
and
as
surrey
felt
the
breath
of
heaven
upon
his
cheek
and
gazed
upon
the
glorious
prospect
before
him
he
wondered
that
his
imprisonment
had
not
driven
him
mad
everything
around
him
indeed
was
calculated
to
make
the
sense
of
captivity
painful
the
broad
and
beautiful
meads
stretching
out
beneath
him
seemed
to
invite
a
ramble
over
them
the
silver
river
courted
a
plunge
into
its
waves
the
woods
an
hour
retirement
into
their
shady
recesses
the
bells
of
eton
college
rang
out
merrily
but
their
sound
saddened
rather
than
elated
him
the
road
between
eton
and
windsor
then
marked
by
straggling
cottages
with
gardens
between
them
with
here
and
there
a
dwelling
of
a
better
kind
was
thronged
with
herds
of
cattle
and
their
drivers
for
a
fair
was
held
that
day
in
the
town
of
windsor
to
which
they
were
hastening
then
there
were
country
maidens
and
youthful
hinds
in
their
holiday
apparel
trooping
towards
the
bridge
booths
were
erected
near
which
in
the
brocas
meads
the
rustic
sports
of
wrestling
running
and
casting
the
bar
were
going
forward
while
numbers
of
boats
shot
to
and
fro
upon
the
river
and
strains
of
music
proceeded
from
a
large
gilt
barge
moored
to
its
banks
nearer
and
in
the
broad
green
plain
lying
beneath
the
north
terrace
were
a
company
of
archers
shooting
at
the
butts
but
these
sights
instead
of
affording
pleasure
to
surrey
only
sharpened
the
anguish
of
his
feelings
by
the
contrast
they
offered
to
his
present
position
to
distract
his
thoughts
he
quitted
the
near
view
and
let
his
eye
run
along
the
edge
of
the
horizon
until
it
rested
upon
a
small
speck
which
he
knew
to
be
the
lofty
spire
of
saint
paul
cathedral
if
as
he
supposed
the
fair
geraldine
was
in
attendance
upon
anne
boleyn
at
the
palace
at
bridewell
she
must
be
under
the
shadow
of
this
very
spire
and
the
supposition
whether
correct
or
not
produced
such
quick
and
stifling
emotions
that
the
tears
rushed
to
his
eyes
ashamed
of
his
weakness
he
turned
to
the
other
side
of
the
tower
and
bent
his
gaze
upon
the
woody
heights
of
the
great
park
these
recalled
herne
the
hunter
and
burning
with
resentment
at
the
tricks
practised
upon
him
by
the
demon
he
determined
that
the
first
use
he
would
make
of
his
liberty
should
be
to
seek
out
and
if
possible
effect
the
capture
of
this
mysterious
being
some
of
the
strange
encounters
between
herne
and
the
king
had
been
related
to
him
by
the
officer
on
guard
at
the
norman
tower
but
these
only
served
as
stimulants
to
the
adventure
after
a
couple
of
hours
thus
passed
on
the
keep
he
descended
refreshed
and
invigorated
the
next
day
he
was
there
again
and
the
day
after
that
when
feeling
that
his
restoration
was
well
nigh
complete
he
requested
permission
to
pass
the
following
evening
in
the
dry
moat
of
the
donjon
and
this
was
readily
accorded
him
covered
with
green
sod
and
shaded
by
many
tall
trees
growing
out
of
the
side
of
the
artificial
mound
on
which
the
keep
was
built
the
fosse
offered
all
the
advantages
of
a
garden
to
the
prisoners
who
were
allowed
to
take
exercise
within
it
here
as
has
been
mentioned
king
james
the
first
of
scotland
first
beheld
from
the
battlements
above
the
lovely
jane
beaufort
take
her
solitary
walk
and
by
his
looks
and
gestures
contrived
to
make
her
sensible
of
the
passion
with
which
she
inspired
him
and
here
at
last
in
an
arbour
which
for
the
sake
of
the
old
and
delightful
legend
connected
with
it
was
kept
up
at
the
time
of
this
chronicle
and
then
bore
the
name
of
the
royal
poet
they
had
secretly
met
and
interchanged
their
vows
of
affection
familiar
with
the
story
familiar
also
with
the
poetic
strains
to
which
the
monarch
passion
gave
birth
surrey
could
not
help
comparing
his
own
fate
with
that
of
the
illustrious
captive
who
had
visited
the
spot
before
him
full
of
such
thoughts
he
pensively
tracked
the
narrow
path
winding
between
the
grassy
banks
of
the
fosse
now
casting
up
his
eyes
to
the
keep
now
looking
towards
the
arbour
and
wishing
that
he
had
been
favoured
with
such
visitings
as
lightened
the
captivity
of
the
scottish
king
at
last
he
sought
the
bower
a
charming
little
nest
of
green
leaves
and
roses
sheltering
a
bench
which
seemed
only
contrived
for
lovers
and
taking
out
his
tablets
began
to
trace
within
them
some
stanzas
of
that
exquisite
poem
which
has
linked
his
name
for
ever
with
the
round
tower
thus
occupied
the
time
stole
on
insensibly
and
he
was
not
aware
that
he
had
the
limits
allowed
him
till
he
was
aroused
by
the
voice
of
the
officer
who
came
to
summon
him
back
to
his
prison
you
will
be
removed
to
your
old
lodging
in
the
round
tower
night
my
lord
said
the
officer
for
what
reason
demanded
the
earl
as
he
followed
his
conductor
up
the
steep
side
of
the
mound
but
receiving
no
reply
he
did
not
renew
the
inquiry
entering
a
door
in
the
covered
way
at
the
head
of
the
flight
of
steps
communicating
with
the
norman
tower
they
descended
them
in
silence
just
as
they
reached
the
foot
of
this
long
staircase
the
earl
chanced
to
cast
back
his
eyes
and
to
his
inexpressible
astonishment
perceived
on
the
landing
at
the
head
of
the
steps
and
just
before
the
piece
of
ordnance
commanding
the
ascent
the
figure
of
herne
the
hunter
before
he
could
utter
an
exclamation
the
figure
retreated
through
the
adjoining
archway
telling
the
officer
what
he
had
seen
surrey
would
fain
have
gone
in
quest
of
the
fiendish
spy
but
the
other
would
not
permit
him
and
affecting
to
treat
the
matter
as
a
mere
creation
of
fancy
he
hurried
the
earl
to
his
chamber
in
the
curfew
tower
the
next
day
surrey
was
removed
betimes
to
the
round
tower
and
the
cause
of
the
transfer
was
soon
explained
by
the
discharge
of
ordnance
the
braying
of
trumpets
and
the
rolling
of
drums
announcing
the
arrival
of
the
king
from
the
mystery
observed
towards
him
surrey
was
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
fair
geraldine
accompanied
the
royal
party
but
he
in
vain
sought
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
truth
of
the
surmise
by
examining
through
the
deep
embrasure
of
his
window
the
cavalcade
that
soon
afterwards
entered
the
upper
quadrangle
amid
the
throng
of
beautiful
dames
surrounding
anne
boleyn
he
could
not
be
certain
that
he
detected
the
fair
geraldine
but
he
readily
distinguished
the
duke
of
richmond
among
the
nobles
and
the
sight
awakened
a
pang
of
bitter
jealousy
in
his
breast
the
day
wore
away
slowly
for
he
could
not
fix
his
attention
upon
his
books
neither
was
he
allowed
to
go
forth
upon
the
battlements
of
the
tower
in
the
evening
however
the
officer
informed
him
he
might
take
exercise
within
the
dry
moat
if
he
was
so
inclined
and
he
gladly
availed
himself
of
the
permission
after
pacing
to
and
fro
along
the
walk
for
a
short
time
he
entered
the
arbour
and
was
about
to
throw
himself
upon
the
bench
when
he
observed
a
slip
of
paper
lying
upon
it
he
took
it
up
and
found
a
few
lines
traced
upon
it
in
hurried
characters
they
ran
thus
the
fair
geraldine
arrived
this
morning
in
the
castle
if
the
earl
of
surrey
desires
to
meet
her
he
will
find
her
within
this
arbour
at
this
billet
was
read
and
by
the
young
earl
with
feelings
of
indescribable
transport
but
a
little
reflection
damped
his
ardour
and
made
him
fear
it
might
be
a
device
to
ensnare
him
there
was
no
certainty
that
the
note
proceeded
in
any
way
from
the
fair
geraldine
nor
could
he
even
be
sure
that
she
was
in
the
castle
still
despite
these
misgivings
the
attraction
was
too
powerful
to
be
resisted
and
he
turned
over
the
means
of
getting
out
of
his
chamber
but
the
scheme
seemed
wholly
impracticable
the
window
was
at
a
considerable
height
above
the
ramparts
of
the
keep
and
even
if
he
could
reach
them
and
escape
the
notice
of
the
sentinels
he
should
have
to
make
a
second
descent
into
the
fosse
and
supposing
all
this
accomplished
how
was
he
to
return
the
impossibility
of
answering
this
latter
mental
interrogation
compelled
him
to
give
up
all
idea
of
the
attempt
on
returning
to
his
he
stationed
himself
at
the
embrasure
overlooking
the
ramparts
and
listened
to
the
regular
tread
of
the
sentinel
below
half
resolved
be
the
consequences
what
they
might
to
descend
as
the
appointed
time
approached
his
anxiety
became
almost
intolerable
and
quitting
the
window
he
began
to
pace
hurriedly
to
and
fro
within
the
chamber
which
as
has
been
previously
observed
partook
of
the
circular
form
of
the
keep
and
was
supported
in
certain
places
by
great
wooden
pillars
and
but
instead
of
dissipating
his
agitation
his
rapid
movements
seemed
rather
to
increase
it
and
at
last
wrought
to
a
pitch
of
uncontrollable
excitement
he
cried
aloud
if
the
fiend
were
to
present
himself
now
and
offer
to
lead
me
to
her
i
would
follow
scarcely
were
the
words
uttered
than
a
hollow
laugh
broke
from
the
farther
end
of
the
chamber
and
a
deep
voice
exclaimed
i
am
ready
to
take
you
to
i
need
not
ask
who
addresses
me
said
surrey
after
a
pause
and
straining
his
eyes
to
distinguish
the
figure
of
the
speaker
in
the
gloom
i
will
tell
you
who
i
am
rejoined
the
other
i
am
he
who
visited
you
once
before
who
showed
you
a
vision
of
the
fair
geraldine
and
carried
off
your
vaunted
relic
ho
ho
avoid
thee
false
fiend
rejoined
surrey
thou
temptest
me
now
in
you
have
summoned
me
returned
herne
and
i
will
not
be
dismissed
i
am
ready
to
convey
you
to
your
mistress
who
awaits
you
in
king
bower
and
marvels
at
your
and
with
what
design
dost
thou
offer
me
this
service
demanded
surrey
it
will
be
time
enough
to
put
that
question
when
i
make
any
condition
replied
herne
enough
i
am
willing
to
aid
you
will
you
go
lead
on
replied
surrey
marching
towards
him
suddenly
herne
drew
a
lantern
from
beneath
the
cloak
in
which
he
was
wrapped
and
threw
its
light
on
a
lying
open
at
his
feet
descend
surrey
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
plunged
down
the
steps
in
another
instant
the
demon
followed
some
hidden
machinery
was
then
set
in
motion
and
the
returned
to
its
place
at
length
surrey
arrived
at
a
narrow
passage
which
appeared
to
correspond
in
form
with
the
bulwarks
of
the
keep
here
herne
passed
him
and
taking
the
lead
hurried
along
the
gallery
and
descended
another
flight
of
steps
which
brought
them
to
a
large
vault
apparently
built
in
the
foundation
of
the
tower
before
the
earl
had
time
to
gaze
round
this
chamber
the
demon
masked
the
lantern
and
taking
his
hand
drew
him
through
a
narrow
passage
terminated
by
a
small
iron
door
which
flew
open
at
a
touch
and
they
emerged
among
the
bushes
clothing
the
side
of
the
mound
you
can
now
proceed
without
my
aid
said
herne
but
take
care
not
to
expose
yourself
to
the
keeping
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
for
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
surrey
hastened
towards
the
arbour
and
as
he
entered
it
to
his
inexpressible
delight
found
that
he
had
not
been
deceived
but
that
the
fair
geraldine
was
indeed
there
how
did
you
contrive
this
meeting
she
cried
after
their
first
greetings
had
passed
and
how
did
you
learn
i
was
in
the
castle
for
the
strictest
instructions
were
given
that
the
tidings
should
not
reach
the
only
response
made
by
surrey
was
to
press
her
lily
hand
devotedly
to
his
lips
i
should
not
have
ventured
hither
pursued
the
fair
geraldine
unless
you
had
sent
me
the
relic
as
a
token
i
knew
you
would
never
part
with
it
and
i
therefore
felt
sure
there
was
no
but
how
did
you
get
here
inquired
surrey
your
messenger
provided
a
by
which
i
descended
into
the
moat
she
replied
surrey
was
stupefied
you
seem
astonished
at
my
resolution
she
continued
and
indeed
i
am
surprised
at
it
myself
but
i
could
not
overcome
my
desire
to
see
you
especially
as
this
meeting
may
be
our
last
the
king
through
the
lady
anne
boleyn
has
positively
enjoined
me
to
think
no
more
of
you
and
has
given
your
father
the
duke
of
norfolk
to
understand
that
your
marriage
without
the
royal
assent
will
be
attended
by
the
loss
of
all
the
favour
he
now
and
think
you
i
will
submit
to
such
tyranny
cried
surrey
alas
replied
the
fair
geraldine
in
a
mournful
tone
i
feel
we
shall
never
be
united
this
conviction
which
has
lately
forced
itself
upon
my
mind
has
not
made
me
love
you
less
though
it
has
in
some
degree
altered
my
feelings
towards
but
i
may
be
able
to
move
the
king
cried
surrey
i
have
some
claim
besides
that
of
kindred
on
the
lady
anne
boleyn
and
she
will
obtain
his
do
not
trust
to
her
replied
the
fair
geraldine
you
may
have
rendered
her
an
important
service
but
be
not
too
sure
of
a
return
no
surrey
i
here
release
you
from
the
troth
you
plighted
to
me
in
the
i
will
not
be
released
from
it
cried
the
earl
hastily
neither
will
i
release
you
i
hold
the
pledge
as
sacred
and
as
binding
as
if
we
had
been
affianced
together
before
for
your
own
sake
do
not
say
so
my
dear
lord
rejoined
the
fair
geraldine
i
beseech
you
do
not
that
your
heart
is
bound
to
me
now
i
well
believe
and
that
you
could
become
inconstant
i
will
not
permit
myself
to
suppose
but
your
youth
forbids
an
union
between
us
for
many
years
and
if
during
that
time
you
should
behold
some
fairer
face
than
mine
or
should
meet
some
heart
you
may
conceive
more
loving
though
that
can
hardly
be
i
would
not
have
a
hasty
vow
restrain
you
be
free
then
free
at
least
for
three
years
and
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
your
affections
are
still
unchanged
i
am
willing
you
should
bind
yourself
to
me
for
i
can
not
act
with
equal
generosity
to
you
rejoined
surrey
in
a
tone
of
deep
disappointment
i
would
sooner
part
with
life
than
relinquish
the
pledge
i
have
received
from
you
but
i
am
content
that
my
constancy
should
be
put
to
the
test
you
propose
during
the
long
term
of
my
probation
i
will
shrink
from
no
trial
of
faith
throughout
europe
i
will
proclaim
your
beauty
in
the
lists
and
will
maintain
its
supremacy
against
all
comers
but
oh
sweet
geraldine
since
we
have
met
in
this
spot
hallowed
by
the
loves
of
james
of
scotland
and
jane
beaufort
let
us
here
renew
our
vows
of
eternal
constancy
and
agree
to
meet
again
at
the
time
you
have
appointed
with
hearts
as
warm
and
loving
as
those
we
bring
together
and
as
he
spoke
he
drew
her
towards
him
and
imprinted
a
passionate
kiss
on
her
lips
let
that
ratify
the
pledge
he
said
ho
ho
ho
laughed
a
deep
voice
without
what
was
that
demanded
the
fair
geraldine
in
a
tone
of
alarm
you
have
the
relic
have
you
not
inquired
the
earl
in
a
low
tone
no
she
replied
your
messenger
merely
showed
it
to
me
but
why
do
you
ask
ah
i
understand
the
fiendish
laughter
that
just
now
sounded
in
my
ears
proceeded
from
herne
the
hunter
replied
surrey
in
a
whisper
but
fear
nothing
i
will
defend
you
with
my
life
ah
accursed
chance
i
have
no
none
would
avail
against
him
murmured
the
fair
geraldine
lead
me
forth
i
shall
die
if
i
stay
supporting
her
in
his
arms
surrey
complied
but
they
had
scarcely
gained
the
entrance
of
the
arbour
when
a
tall
figure
stood
before
them
it
was
the
duke
of
richmond
a
gleam
of
moonlight
penetrating
through
the
leaves
fell
upon
the
group
and
rendered
them
distinctly
visible
to
each
other
soh
exclaimed
the
duke
after
regarding
the
pair
in
silence
for
a
moment
i
have
not
been
misinformed
you
have
contrived
a
meeting
richmond
said
surrey
sternly
we
once
were
dear
and
loving
friends
and
we
are
still
honourable
foes
i
know
that
i
am
safe
with
you
i
know
you
will
breathe
no
word
about
this
meeting
either
to
the
fair
geraldine
prejudice
or
mine
you
judge
me
rightly
my
lord
replied
the
duke
in
a
tone
of
equal
sternness
i
have
no
thought
of
betraying
you
though
by
a
word
to
my
royal
father
i
could
prevent
all
chance
of
future
rivalry
on
your
part
i
shall
however
demand
a
strict
account
from
you
on
your
grace
acts
as
beseems
a
loyal
gentleman
replied
surrey
hereafter
i
will
not
fail
to
account
to
you
for
my
conduct
in
any
way
you
oh
let
me
interpose
between
you
my
lords
cried
the
fair
geraldine
to
prevent
the
disastrous
consequences
of
this
quarrel
i
have
already
told
your
grace
i
can
not
love
you
and
that
my
heart
is
devoted
to
the
earl
of
surrey
let
me
appeal
to
your
noble
nature
to
your
generosity
not
to
persist
in
a
hopeless
you
have
conquered
madam
said
the
duke
after
a
pause
i
have
been
to
blame
in
this
matter
but
i
will
make
amends
for
my
error
surrey
i
relinquish
her
to
my
friend
exclaimed
the
earl
casting
himself
into
the
duke
arms
i
will
now
endeavour
to
heal
the
wounds
i
have
unwittingly
occasioned
said
the
fair
geraldine
i
am
surprised
your
grace
should
be
insensible
to
attractions
so
far
superior
to
mine
as
those
of
the
lady
mary
the
lady
mary
is
very
beautiful
i
confess
said
the
duke
and
if
you
had
not
been
in
the
way
i
should
assuredly
have
been
her
i
ought
not
to
betray
the
secret
perhaps
hesitated
the
fair
geraldine
but
gratitude
prompts
me
to
do
so
the
lady
is
not
so
blind
to
your
grace
merits
as
i
have
indeed
exclaimed
the
duke
if
it
be
so
surrey
we
may
yet
be
brothers
as
well
as
and
that
it
is
so
i
can
avouch
richmond
rejoined
the
earl
for
i
am
in
my
sister
secret
as
well
as
the
fair
geraldine
but
now
that
this
explanation
has
taken
place
i
must
entreat
your
grace
to
conduct
the
fair
geraldine
back
to
her
lodgings
while
i
regain
the
best
way
i
can
my
chamber
in
the
round
i
marvel
how
you
escaped
from
it
said
richmond
but
i
suppose
it
was
by
the
connivance
of
the
he
who
set
me
free
who
brought
the
fair
geraldine
hither
and
who
i
suspect
acquainted
you
with
our
meeting
was
no
other
than
herne
the
hunter
replied
surrey
you
amaze
me
exclaimed
the
duke
it
was
indeed
a
tall
dark
man
muffled
in
a
cloak
who
informed
me
that
you
were
to
meet
at
midnight
in
king
james
bower
in
the
moat
and
i
therefore
came
to
surprise
your
informant
was
herne
replied
surrey
right
exclaimed
the
demon
stepping
from
behind
a
tree
where
he
had
hitherto
remained
concealed
it
was
i
i
herne
the
hunter
and
i
contrived
the
meeting
in
anticipation
of
a
far
different
result
from
that
which
has
ensued
but
i
now
tell
you
my
lord
of
surrey
that
it
is
idle
to
indulge
a
passion
for
the
fair
geraldine
you
will
never
wed
false
fiend
thou
liest
cried
surrey
time
will
show
replied
herne
i
repeat
you
will
wed
another
and
more
i
tell
you
you
are
blinder
than
richmond
has
shown
himself
for
the
most
illustrious
damsel
in
the
kingdom
has
regarded
you
with
eyes
of
affection
and
yet
you
have
not
perceived
the
princess
mary
demanded
richmond
ay
the
princess
mary
repeated
herne
how
say
you
now
my
lord
will
you
let
ambition
usurp
the
place
of
love
no
replied
surrey
but
i
will
hold
no
further
converse
with
thee
thou
wouldst
tempt
to
perdition
hence
fiend
unless
you
trust
yourself
to
my
guidance
you
will
never
reach
your
chamber
rejoined
herne
with
a
mocking
laugh
the
iron
door
in
the
mound
can
not
be
opened
on
this
side
and
you
well
know
what
the
consequence
of
a
discovery
will
be
come
or
i
leave
you
to
your
and
he
moved
down
the
path
on
the
right
go
with
him
surrey
cried
richmond
pressing
the
fair
geraldine
to
his
breast
the
earl
committed
her
to
the
charge
of
his
friend
and
tearing
himself
away
followed
the
steps
of
the
demon
he
had
not
proceeded
far
when
he
heard
his
name
pronounced
by
a
voice
issuing
from
the
tree
above
him
looking
up
he
saw
herne
in
one
of
the
topmost
branches
and
at
a
sign
instantly
climbed
up
to
him
the
thick
foliage
screened
them
from
observation
and
surrey
concluded
his
guide
was
awaiting
the
disappearance
of
the
sentinel
who
was
at
that
moment
approaching
the
tree
but
such
apparently
was
not
the
intentions
for
the
man
had
scarcely
passed
than
herne
sprang
upon
the
ramparts
and
the
poor
fellow
turning
at
the
sound
was
almost
scared
out
of
his
senses
at
the
sight
of
the
dreaded
fiend
dropping
his
halbert
he
fell
upon
his
face
with
a
stifled
cry
herne
then
motioned
surrey
to
descend
and
they
marched
together
quickly
to
a
low
door
opening
into
the
keep
passing
through
it
and
ascending
a
flight
of
steps
they
stood
upon
the
landing
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
communicating
with
the
norman
tower
and
adjoining
the
entrance
to
surrey
chamber
apparently
familiar
with
the
spot
herne
took
down
a
large
key
from
a
nail
in
the
wall
against
which
it
hung
and
unlocked
the
door
enter
he
said
to
surrey
and
do
not
forget
the
debt
you
owe
to
herne
the
and
as
the
earl
stepped
into
the
chamber
the
door
was
locked
behind
him
ii
how
sir
thomas
wyat
found
mabel
in
the
sandstone
cave
and
what
happened
to
him
there
a
week
after
the
foregoing
occurrence
the
earl
of
surrey
was
set
free
but
his
joy
at
regaining
his
liberty
was
damped
by
learning
that
the
fair
geraldine
had
departed
for
ireland
she
had
left
the
tenderest
messages
for
him
with
his
sister
the
lady
mary
howard
accompanied
with
assurances
of
unalterable
attachment
but
other
changes
had
taken
place
which
were
calculated
to
afford
him
some
consolation
ever
since
the
night
on
which
he
had
been
told
the
lady
mary
was
not
indifferent
to
him
richmond
had
devoted
himself
entirely
to
her
and
matters
had
already
proceeded
so
far
that
he
had
asked
her
in
marriage
of
the
duke
of
norfolk
who
after
ascertaining
the
king
pleasure
on
the
subject
had
gladly
given
his
consent
and
the
youthful
pair
were
affianced
to
each
other
surrey
and
richmond
now
became
closer
friends
than
ever
and
if
amid
the
thousand
distractions
of
henry
gay
and
festive
court
the
young
earl
did
not
forget
the
fair
geraldine
he
did
not
at
least
find
the
time
hang
heavily
on
his
hands
about
a
week
after
wolsey
dismissal
while
the
court
was
still
sojourning
at
windsor
surrey
proposed
to
richmond
to
ride
one
morning
with
him
in
the
great
park
the
duke
willingly
assented
and
mounting
their
steeds
they
galloped
towards
snow
hill
wholly
unattended
while
mounting
this
charming
ascent
at
a
more
leisurely
pace
the
earl
said
to
his
companion
i
will
now
tell
you
why
i
proposed
this
ride
to
you
richmond
i
have
long
determined
to
follow
up
the
adventure
of
herne
the
hunter
and
i
wish
to
confer
with
you
about
it
and
ascertain
whether
you
are
disposed
to
join
i
know
not
what
to
say
surrey
replied
the
duke
gravely
and
speaking
in
a
low
tone
the
king
my
father
failed
in
his
endeavours
to
expel
the
demon
who
still
lords
it
in
the
the
greater
glory
to
us
if
we
succeed
said
surrey
i
will
take
counsel
with
lady
mary
on
the
subject
before
i
give
an
answer
rejoined
richmond
then
there
is
little
doubt
what
your
grace
decision
will
be
laughed
surrey
to
speak
truth
it
was
the
fear
of
your
consulting
her
that
made
me
bring
you
here
what
say
you
to
a
ride
in
the
forest
night
i
have
little
fancy
for
it
replied
richmond
and
if
you
will
be
ruled
by
me
you
will
not
attempt
the
enterprise
my
resolution
is
taken
said
the
earl
but
now
since
we
have
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
let
us
push
forward
to
the
a
rapid
ride
of
some
twenty
minutes
brought
them
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
they
proceeded
along
the
verdant
path
leading
to
the
forester
hut
on
arriving
at
the
dwelling
it
appeared
wholly
deserted
but
they
nevertheless
dismounted
and
tying
their
horses
to
the
trees
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
entered
it
while
they
were
examining
the
lower
room
the
plash
of
oars
reached
their
ears
and
rushing
to
the
window
they
descried
the
skiff
rapidly
approaching
the
shore
a
man
was
seated
within
it
whose
attire
though
sombre
seemed
to
proclaim
him
of
some
rank
but
as
his
back
was
towards
them
they
could
not
discern
his
features
in
another
instant
the
skiff
touched
the
strand
and
the
rower
leaping
ashore
proved
to
be
sir
thomas
wyat
on
making
this
discovery
they
both
ran
out
to
him
and
the
warmest
greetings
passed
between
them
when
these
were
over
surrey
expressed
his
surprise
to
wyat
at
seeing
him
there
declaring
he
was
wholly
unaware
of
his
return
from
the
court
of
france
i
came
back
about
a
month
ago
said
wyat
his
majesty
supposes
me
at
allington
nor
shall
i
return
to
court
without
a
i
am
not
sorry
to
hear
it
said
surrey
but
what
are
you
doing
here
my
errand
is
a
strange
and
adventurous
one
replied
wyat
you
may
have
heard
that
before
i
departed
for
france
i
passed
some
days
in
the
forest
in
company
with
herne
the
hunter
what
then
happened
to
me
i
may
not
disclose
but
i
vowed
never
to
rest
till
i
have
freed
this
forest
from
the
weird
being
who
troubles
say
you
so
cried
surrey
then
you
are
most
fortunately
encountered
sir
thomas
for
i
myself
as
richmond
will
tell
you
am
equally
bent
upon
the
fiend
expulsion
we
will
be
companions
in
the
we
will
speak
of
that
anon
replied
wyat
i
was
sorry
to
find
this
cottage
uninhabited
and
the
fair
damsel
who
dwelt
within
it
when
i
beheld
it
last
gone
what
has
become
of
her
it
is
a
strange
story
said
richmond
and
he
proceeded
to
relate
all
that
was
known
to
have
befallen
mabel
wyat
listened
with
profound
attention
to
the
recital
and
at
its
close
said
i
think
i
can
find
a
clue
to
this
mystery
but
to
obtain
it
i
must
go
alone
meet
me
here
at
midnight
and
i
doubt
not
we
shall
be
able
to
accomplish
our
may
i
not
ask
for
some
explanation
of
your
scheme
said
surrey
not
yet
rejoined
wyat
but
i
will
freely
confess
to
you
that
there
is
much
danger
in
the
enterprise
danger
that
i
would
not
willingly
any
one
should
share
with
me
especially
you
surrey
to
whom
i
owe
so
much
if
you
do
not
find
me
here
therefore
night
conclude
that
i
have
perished
or
am
well
be
it
as
you
will
wyat
said
surrey
but
i
would
gladly
accompany
you
and
share
your
i
know
it
and
i
thank
you
returned
wyat
warmly
grasping
the
hand
but
much
nay
all
may
remain
to
be
done
night
you
had
better
bring
some
force
with
you
for
we
may
need
i
will
bring
half
a
dozen
stout
archers
replied
surrey
and
if
you
come
not
depend
upon
it
i
will
either
release
you
or
avenge
i
did
not
intend
to
prosecute
this
adventure
further
said
richmond
but
since
you
are
both
resolved
to
embark
in
it
i
will
not
desert
soon
after
this
the
friends
separated
surrey
and
richmond
taking
horse
and
returning
to
the
castle
discoursing
on
the
unlooked
for
meeting
with
wyat
while
the
latter
again
entered
the
skiff
and
rowed
down
the
lake
as
soon
as
the
hut
was
clear
two
persons
descended
the
steps
of
a
ladder
leading
to
a
sort
of
loft
in
the
roof
and
sprang
upon
the
floor
of
the
hut
ho
ho
ho
laughed
the
foremost
whose
antlered
helm
and
wild
garb
proclaimed
him
to
be
herne
they
little
dreamed
who
were
the
hearers
of
their
conference
so
they
think
to
take
me
fenwolf
ha
they
know
not
whom
they
have
to
deal
with
rejoined
the
latter
they
should
do
so
by
this
time
said
herne
but
i
will
tell
thee
why
sir
thomas
wyat
has
undertaken
this
enterprise
it
is
not
to
capture
me
though
that
may
be
one
object
that
moves
him
but
he
wishes
to
see
mabel
lyndwood
the
momentary
glimpse
he
caught
of
her
bright
eyes
was
sufficient
to
inflame
ah
exclaimed
fenwolf
think
you
so
i
am
assured
of
it
replied
herne
he
knows
the
secret
of
the
cave
and
will
find
her
but
he
will
never
return
to
tell
what
he
has
seen
said
fenwolf
moodily
i
know
not
that
replied
herne
i
have
my
own
views
respecting
him
i
want
to
renew
my
he
will
never
join
you
rejoined
fenwolf
what
if
i
offer
him
mabel
as
a
bait
said
herne
you
will
not
do
so
dread
master
rejoined
fenwolf
trembling
and
turning
pale
she
belongs
to
to
thee
fool
cried
herne
with
a
derisive
laugh
thinkest
thou
i
would
resign
such
a
treasure
to
thee
no
no
but
rest
easy
i
will
not
give
her
to
you
mean
her
for
yourself
then
said
fenwolf
darest
thou
to
question
me
cried
herne
striking
him
with
the
hand
armed
with
the
iron
gyves
this
to
teach
thee
and
this
to
prove
whether
thou
art
mortal
or
rejoined
fenwolf
plucking
his
from
his
belt
and
striking
it
with
all
his
force
against
the
other
breast
but
though
surely
and
forcibly
dealt
the
blow
glanced
off
as
if
the
demon
were
cased
in
steel
and
the
intended
assassin
fell
back
in
amazement
while
an
unearthly
laugh
rang
in
his
ears
never
had
fenwolf
seen
herne
wear
so
formidable
a
look
as
he
at
that
moment
assumed
his
giant
frame
dilated
his
eyes
flashed
fire
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
so
fearful
that
fenwolf
shielded
his
eyes
with
his
hands
ah
miserable
dog
thundered
herne
dost
thou
think
i
am
to
be
hurt
by
mortal
hands
or
mortal
weapons
thy
former
experience
should
have
taught
thee
differently
but
since
thou
hast
provoked
it
take
thy
fate
uttering
these
words
he
seized
fenwolf
by
the
throat
clutching
him
with
a
terrific
gripe
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
miserable
wretch
would
have
paid
the
penalty
of
his
rashness
if
a
person
had
not
at
the
moment
appeared
at
the
doorway
flinging
his
prey
hastily
backwards
herne
turned
at
the
interruption
and
perceived
old
tristram
lyndwood
who
looked
appalled
at
what
he
beheld
ah
it
is
thou
tristram
cried
herne
thou
art
just
in
time
to
witness
the
punishment
of
this
rebellious
spare
him
dread
master
oh
spare
him
cried
tristram
imploringly
well
said
herne
gazing
at
the
caitiff
he
may
live
he
will
not
offend
again
but
why
hast
thou
ventured
from
thy
tristram
i
came
to
inform
you
that
i
have
just
observed
a
person
row
across
the
lake
in
the
skiff
replied
the
old
man
he
appears
to
be
taking
the
direction
of
the
secret
entrance
to
the
it
is
sir
thomas
wyat
replied
herne
i
am
aware
of
his
proceedings
stay
with
fenwolf
till
he
is
able
to
move
and
then
proceed
with
him
to
the
cave
but
mark
me
no
violence
must
be
done
to
wyat
if
you
find
him
there
any
neglect
of
my
orders
in
this
respect
will
be
followed
by
severe
punishment
i
shall
be
at
the
cave
ere
long
but
meanwhile
i
have
other
business
to
and
quitting
the
hut
he
plunged
into
the
wood
meanwhile
sir
thomas
wyat
having
crossed
the
lake
landed
and
fastened
the
skiff
to
a
tree
struck
into
the
wood
and
presently
reached
the
open
space
in
which
lay
the
secret
entrance
to
the
cave
he
was
not
long
in
finding
the
stone
though
it
was
so
artfully
concealed
by
the
brushwood
that
it
would
have
escaped
any
uninstructed
eye
and
removing
it
the
narrow
entrance
to
the
cave
was
revealed
committing
himself
to
the
protection
of
heaven
wyat
entered
and
having
taken
the
precaution
of
drawing
the
stone
after
him
which
was
easily
accomplished
by
a
handle
fixed
to
the
inner
side
of
it
he
commenced
the
descent
at
first
he
had
to
creep
along
but
the
passage
gradually
got
higher
until
at
length
on
reaching
the
level
ground
he
was
able
to
stand
upright
there
was
no
light
to
guide
him
but
by
feeling
against
the
sides
of
the
passage
he
found
that
he
was
in
the
long
gallery
he
had
formerly
threaded
uncertain
which
way
to
turn
he
determined
to
trust
to
chance
for
taking
the
right
direction
and
drawing
his
sword
proceeded
slowly
to
the
right
for
some
time
he
encountered
no
obstacle
neither
could
he
detect
the
slightest
sound
but
he
perceived
that
the
atmosphere
grew
damp
and
that
the
sides
of
the
passage
were
covered
with
moisture
thus
warned
he
proceeded
with
great
caution
and
presently
found
after
emerging
into
a
more
open
space
and
striking
off
on
the
left
that
he
had
arrived
at
the
edge
of
the
pool
of
water
which
he
knew
lay
at
the
end
of
the
large
cavern
while
considering
how
he
should
next
proceed
a
faint
gleam
of
light
became
visible
at
the
upper
end
of
the
vault
changing
his
position
for
the
pillars
prevented
him
from
seeing
the
source
of
the
glimmer
he
discovered
that
it
issued
from
a
lamp
borne
by
a
female
hand
who
he
had
no
doubt
was
mabel
on
making
this
discovery
he
sprang
forwards
and
called
to
her
but
instantly
repented
his
rashness
for
as
he
uttered
the
cry
the
light
was
extinguished
wyat
was
now
completely
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
he
was
satisfied
that
mabel
was
in
the
vault
but
in
what
way
to
guide
himself
to
her
retreat
he
could
not
tell
and
it
was
evident
she
herself
would
not
assist
him
persuaded
however
if
he
could
but
make
himself
known
he
should
no
longer
be
shunned
he
entered
one
of
the
lateral
passages
and
ever
and
anon
as
he
proceeded
repeated
mabel
name
in
a
low
soft
tone
the
stratagem
was
successful
presently
he
heard
a
light
footstep
approaching
him
and
a
gentle
voice
inquired
who
calls
me
a
friend
replied
wyat
your
name
she
demanded
you
will
not
know
me
if
i
declare
myself
mabel
he
replied
but
i
am
called
sir
thomas
the
name
is
well
known
to
me
she
replied
in
trembling
tones
and
i
have
seen
you
once
at
my
grandfather
cottage
but
why
have
you
come
here
do
you
know
where
you
are
i
know
that
i
am
in
the
cave
of
herne
the
hunter
replied
wyat
and
one
of
my
motives
for
seeking
it
was
to
set
you
free
but
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
your
flight
alas
there
is
she
replied
i
am
chained
here
by
bonds
i
can
not
break
herne
has
declared
that
any
attempt
at
escape
on
my
part
shall
be
followed
by
the
death
of
my
grandsire
and
he
does
not
threaten
idly
as
no
doubt
you
know
besides
the
most
terrible
vengeance
would
fall
on
my
own
head
no
i
can
not
dare
not
fly
but
let
us
not
talk
in
the
dark
come
with
me
to
procure
a
light
give
me
your
hand
and
i
will
lead
you
to
my
taking
the
small
trembling
hand
offered
him
wyat
followed
his
conductress
down
the
passage
a
few
steps
brought
them
to
a
door
which
she
pushed
aside
and
disclosed
a
small
chamber
hewn
out
of
the
rock
in
a
recess
of
which
a
lamp
was
burning
lighting
the
lamp
which
she
had
recently
extinguished
she
placed
it
on
a
rude
table
have
you
been
long
a
prisoner
here
asked
wyat
fixing
his
regards
upon
her
countenance
which
though
it
had
lost
somewhat
of
its
bloom
had
gained
much
in
interest
and
beauty
for
three
months
i
suppose
she
replied
but
i
am
not
able
to
calculate
the
lapse
of
time
it
has
seemed
very
very
long
oh
that
i
could
behold
the
sun
again
and
breathe
the
fresh
pure
air
come
with
me
and
you
shall
do
so
rejoined
wyat
i
have
told
you
i
can
not
fly
she
answered
i
can
not
sacrifice
my
but
if
he
is
leagued
with
this
demon
he
deserves
the
worst
fate
that
can
befall
him
said
wyat
you
should
think
only
of
your
own
safety
what
can
be
the
motive
of
your
detention
i
tremble
to
think
of
it
she
replied
but
i
fear
that
herne
has
conceived
a
passion
for
then
indeed
you
must
fly
cried
wyat
such
unhallowed
love
will
tend
to
perdition
of
soul
and
oh
that
there
was
any
hope
for
me
she
ejaculated
there
is
hope
replied
wyat
i
will
protect
you
will
care
for
you
will
love
love
me
exclaimed
mabel
a
deep
blush
overspreading
her
pale
features
you
love
absence
has
enabled
me
to
overcome
the
vehemence
of
my
passion
replied
wyat
and
i
feel
that
my
heart
is
susceptible
of
new
emotions
but
you
maiden
he
added
coldly
you
are
captivated
by
the
admiration
of
the
my
love
like
yours
is
past
she
answered
with
a
faint
smile
but
if
i
were
out
of
herne
power
i
feel
that
i
could
love
again
and
far
more
deeply
than
i
loved
before
for
that
in
fact
was
rather
the
result
of
vanity
than
of
real
mabel
said
wyat
taking
her
hand
and
gazing
into
her
eyes
if
i
set
you
free
will
you
love
me
i
love
you
already
she
replied
but
if
that
could
be
my
whole
life
should
be
devoted
to
you
ha
she
exclaimed
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
footsteps
are
approaching
it
is
fenwolf
hide
yourself
within
that
though
doubting
the
prudence
of
the
course
wyat
yielded
to
her
terrified
and
imploring
looks
and
concealed
himself
in
the
manner
she
had
indicated
he
was
scarcely
ensconed
in
the
recess
when
the
door
opened
and
morgan
fenwolf
stepped
in
followed
by
her
grandfather
fenwolf
gazed
suspiciously
round
the
little
chamber
and
then
glanced
significantly
at
old
tristram
but
he
made
no
remark
what
brings
you
here
demanded
mabel
tremblingly
you
are
wanted
in
the
cave
said
fenwolf
i
will
follow
you
anon
she
replied
you
must
come
at
once
rejoined
fenwolf
authoritatively
herne
will
become
upon
this
mabel
rose
and
without
daring
to
cast
a
look
towards
the
spot
where
wyat
was
concealed
quitted
the
cell
with
them
no
sooner
were
they
all
out
than
fenwolf
hastily
shutting
the
door
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
taking
it
out
exclaimed
so
we
have
secured
you
sir
thomas
wyat
no
fear
of
your
revealing
the
secret
of
the
cave
now
or
flying
with
mabel
ha
ha
to
here
iii
in
what
manner
herne
declared
his
passion
for
mabel
utterly
disregarding
her
cries
and
entreaties
fenwolf
dragged
mabel
into
the
great
cavern
and
forced
her
to
take
a
seat
on
a
bench
near
the
spot
where
a
heap
of
ashes
showed
that
the
fire
was
ordinarily
lighted
all
this
while
her
grandfather
had
averted
his
face
from
her
as
if
fearing
to
meet
her
regards
and
he
now
busied
himself
in
striking
a
light
and
setting
fire
to
a
pile
of
fagots
and
small
logs
of
wood
i
thought
you
told
me
herne
was
here
said
mabel
in
a
tone
of
bitter
reproach
to
fenwolf
who
seated
himself
beside
her
on
the
bench
he
will
be
here
ere
long
he
replied
sullenly
oh
do
not
detain
sir
thomas
wyat
cried
mabel
piteously
do
not
deliver
him
to
your
dread
master
do
what
you
will
with
me
but
let
him
i
will
tell
you
what
i
will
do
replied
fenwolf
in
a
low
tone
i
will
set
sir
thomas
at
liberty
and
run
all
risks
of
displeasure
if
you
will
promise
to
be
mabel
replied
by
a
look
of
unutterable
disgust
then
he
will
await
herne
coming
where
he
is
rejoined
fenwolf
saying
which
he
arose
and
pushing
a
table
near
the
bench
took
the
remains
of
a
huge
venison
pasty
and
a
loaf
from
a
hutch
standing
on
one
side
of
the
cavern
by
this
time
old
tristram
having
succeeded
in
lighting
the
fire
placed
himself
at
the
farther
end
of
the
table
and
fell
to
work
upon
the
viands
with
fenwolf
mabel
was
pressed
to
partake
of
the
repast
but
she
declined
the
offer
a
large
stone
bottle
was
next
produced
and
emptied
of
its
contents
by
the
pair
who
seemed
well
contented
with
their
regale
meanwhile
mabel
was
revolving
the
possibility
of
flight
and
had
more
than
once
determined
to
make
an
attempt
but
fear
restrained
her
her
grandsire
as
has
been
stated
sedulously
avoided
her
gaze
and
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
her
complaints
and
entreaties
but
once
when
fenwolf
back
was
turned
she
caught
him
gazing
at
her
with
peculiar
significance
and
then
comprehended
the
meaning
of
his
strange
conduct
he
evidently
only
awaited
an
opportunity
to
assist
her
satisfied
of
this
she
became
more
tranquil
and
about
an
hour
having
elapsed
during
which
nothing
was
said
by
the
party
the
low
winding
of
a
horn
was
heard
and
fenwolf
started
to
his
feet
exclaiming
it
is
herne
the
next
moment
the
demon
huntsman
rode
from
one
of
the
lateral
passages
into
the
cave
he
was
mounted
on
a
black
horse
with
flowing
mane
and
tail
eyes
glowing
like
carbuncles
and
in
all
respects
resembling
the
sable
steed
he
had
lost
in
the
forest
springing
to
the
ground
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
fenwolf
in
a
low
tone
and
delivering
his
steed
to
him
with
orders
to
take
it
to
the
stable
signed
to
tristram
to
go
with
him
and
approached
mabel
so
you
have
seen
sir
thomas
wyat
i
find
he
said
in
a
stern
tone
mabel
made
no
answer
and
did
not
even
raise
her
eyes
towards
him
and
he
has
told
you
he
loves
you
and
has
urged
you
to
fly
with
him
ha
pursued
herne
mabel
still
did
not
dare
to
look
up
but
a
deep
blush
overspread
her
cheek
he
was
mad
to
venture
hither
continued
herne
but
having
done
so
he
must
take
the
you
will
not
destroy
him
cried
mabel
imploringly
he
will
perish
by
a
hand
as
terrible
as
mine
laughed
herne
by
that
of
famine
he
will
never
quit
the
dungeon
alive
unless
unless
what
gasped
mabel
unless
he
is
leagued
with
me
replied
herne
and
now
let
him
pass
for
i
would
speak
of
myself
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
love
you
and
am
resolved
to
make
you
mine
you
shudder
but
wherefore
it
is
a
glorious
destiny
to
be
the
bride
of
the
wild
hunter
the
fiend
who
rules
the
forest
and
who
in
his
broad
domain
is
more
powerful
than
the
king
the
old
forester
robin
hood
had
his
maid
marian
and
what
was
he
compared
to
me
he
had
neither
my
skill
nor
my
power
be
mine
and
you
shall
accompany
me
on
my
midnight
rides
shall
watch
the
fleet
stag
dart
over
the
moonlight
glade
or
down
the
lengthened
vista
you
shall
feel
all
the
unutterable
excitement
of
the
chase
you
shall
thread
with
me
the
tangled
grove
swim
the
river
and
the
lake
and
enjoy
a
thousand
pleasures
hitherto
unknown
to
you
be
mine
and
i
will
make
you
mistress
of
all
my
secrets
and
compel
the
band
whom
i
will
gather
round
me
to
pay
you
homage
be
mine
and
you
shall
have
power
of
life
and
death
over
them
as
if
you
were
absolute
queen
and
from
me
whom
all
fear
and
all
obey
you
shall
have
love
and
and
he
would
have
taken
her
hand
but
she
recoiled
from
horror
though
i
now
inspire
you
with
terror
and
aversion
pursued
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
love
me
as
passionately
as
i
was
beloved
by
one
of
whom
you
are
the
and
she
is
dead
asked
mabel
with
curiosity
dead
exclaimed
herne
thrice
fifty
years
have
flown
since
she
dwelt
upon
earth
the
acorn
which
was
shed
in
the
forest
has
grown
into
a
lusty
oak
while
trees
at
that
time
in
their
pride
have
fallen
and
decayed
away
dead
yes
she
has
passed
from
all
memory
save
mine
where
she
will
ever
dwell
generations
of
men
have
gone
down
to
the
grave
since
her
time
a
succession
of
kings
have
lodged
within
the
castle
but
i
am
still
a
denizen
of
the
forest
for
crimes
i
then
committed
i
am
doomed
to
wander
within
it
and
i
shall
haunt
it
unless
released
till
the
crack
of
liberate
me
cried
mabel
liberate
your
other
prisoner
and
we
will
pray
for
your
no
more
of
this
cried
herne
fiercely
if
you
would
not
call
down
instant
and
terrible
punishment
on
your
head
punishment
that
i
can
not
avert
and
must
inflict
you
will
mention
nothing
sacred
in
my
hearing
and
never
allude
to
prayer
i
am
beyond
the
reach
of
oh
say
not
so
cried
mabel
in
a
tone
of
commiseration
i
will
tell
you
how
my
doom
was
accomplished
rejoined
herne
wildly
to
gain
her
of
whom
i
have
just
spoken
and
who
was
already
vowed
to
heaven
i
invoked
the
powers
of
darkness
i
proffered
my
soul
to
the
evil
one
if
he
would
secure
her
to
me
and
the
condition
demanded
by
him
was
that
i
should
become
what
i
am
the
fiend
of
the
forest
with
power
to
terrify
and
to
tempt
and
with
other
more
fearful
and
fatal
powers
oh
exclaimed
mabel
i
grasped
at
the
offer
pursued
herne
she
i
loved
became
mine
but
she
was
speedily
snatched
from
me
by
death
and
since
then
i
have
known
no
human
passion
except
hatred
and
revenge
i
have
dwelt
in
this
forest
sometimes
alone
sometimes
at
the
head
of
a
numerous
band
but
always
exerting
a
baneful
influence
over
mankind
at
last
i
saw
the
image
of
her
i
loved
again
appear
before
me
and
the
old
passion
was
revived
within
my
breast
chance
has
thrown
you
in
my
way
and
mine
you
shall
be
i
will
die
rather
she
replied
with
a
shudder
you
can
not
escape
me
rejoined
he
me
with
a
triumphant
laugh
you
can
not
avoid
your
fate
but
i
want
not
to
deal
harshly
with
you
i
love
you
and
would
win
you
rather
by
persuasion
than
by
force
consent
to
be
mine
then
and
i
give
wyat
his
life
and
i
can
not
i
can
not
she
replied
not
only
do
i
offer
you
wyat
life
as
the
price
of
your
compliance
persevered
herne
but
you
shall
have
what
ever
else
you
may
seek
jewels
ornaments
costly
attire
treasure
for
of
such
i
possess
a
goodly
and
of
what
use
would
they
be
to
me
here
said
mabel
i
will
not
always
confine
you
to
this
cave
replied
herne
you
shall
go
where
you
please
and
live
as
you
please
but
you
must
come
to
me
whenever
i
summon
and
what
of
my
grandsire
she
demanded
tristram
lyndwood
is
no
relative
of
yours
replied
herne
i
will
now
clear
up
the
mystery
that
hangs
over
your
birth
you
are
the
offspring
of
one
who
for
years
has
exercised
greater
sway
than
the
king
within
this
realm
but
who
is
now
disgraced
and
ruined
and
nigh
his
end
his
priestly
vows
forbid
him
to
own
you
even
if
he
desired
to
do
have
i
seen
him
demanded
mabel
you
have
replied
herne
and
he
has
seen
you
and
little
did
he
know
when
he
sought
you
out
that
he
was
essaying
to
maintain
his
own
power
and
overturn
that
of
another
by
the
dishonour
of
his
daughter
though
if
he
had
done
so
he
added
with
a
scoffing
laugh
it
might
not
have
restrained
i
know
whom
you
mean
said
mabel
and
is
it
possible
he
can
be
my
father
it
is
as
i
have
told
you
replied
herne
you
now
know
my
resolve
at
midnight
our
nuptials
shall
take
nuptials
echoed
mabel
ay
at
that
altar
he
cried
pointing
to
the
druid
pile
of
stones
there
you
shall
vow
yourself
to
me
and
i
to
you
before
terrible
witnesses
i
shall
have
no
fear
that
you
will
break
your
oath
reflect
upon
what
i
have
with
this
he
placed
the
bugle
to
his
lips
blew
a
low
call
upon
it
and
fenwolf
and
tristram
immediately
answering
the
summons
he
whispered
some
instructions
to
the
former
and
disappeared
down
one
of
the
side
passages
fenwolf
deportment
was
now
more
sullen
than
before
in
vain
did
mabel
inquire
from
him
what
herne
was
about
to
do
with
sir
thomas
wyat
he
returned
no
answer
and
at
last
wearied
by
her
importunity
desired
her
to
hold
her
peace
just
then
tristram
quitted
the
cavern
for
a
moment
when
he
instantly
changed
his
manner
and
to
her
quickly
i
overheard
what
passed
between
you
and
herne
consent
to
be
mine
and
i
will
deliver
you
from
that
were
to
exchange
one
evil
for
another
she
replied
if
you
would
serve
me
deliver
sir
thomas
i
will
only
deliver
him
on
the
terms
i
have
mentioned
replied
fenwolf
at
this
moment
tristram
returned
and
the
conversation
ceased
fresh
logs
were
then
thrown
on
the
fire
by
fenwolf
and
at
his
request
tristram
proceeded
to
a
hole
in
the
rock
which
served
as
a
sort
of
larder
and
brought
from
it
some
pieces
of
venison
which
were
broiled
upon
the
embers
at
the
close
of
the
repast
of
which
she
sparingly
partook
mabel
was
conducted
by
morgan
fenwolf
into
a
small
chamber
opening
out
of
the
great
cavern
which
was
furnished
like
the
cell
she
had
lately
occupied
with
a
small
straw
pallet
leaving
her
a
lamp
fenwolf
locked
the
door
and
placed
the
key
in
his
girdle
iv
how
sir
thomas
wyat
was
visited
by
herne
in
the
cell
made
aware
by
the
clangour
of
the
lock
and
fenwolf
exulting
laughter
of
the
snare
in
which
he
had
been
caught
sir
thomas
wyat
instantly
sprang
from
his
and
rushed
to
the
door
but
being
framed
of
the
stoutest
oak
and
strengthened
with
plates
of
iron
it
defied
all
his
efforts
nerved
as
they
were
by
rage
and
despair
to
burst
it
open
mabel
shrieks
as
she
was
dragged
away
reached
his
ears
and
increased
his
anguish
and
he
called
out
loudly
to
her
companions
to
return
but
his
vociferations
were
only
treated
with
derision
finding
it
useless
to
struggle
further
wyat
threw
himself
upon
the
bench
and
endeavoured
to
discover
some
means
of
deliverance
from
his
present
hazardous
position
he
glanced
round
the
cell
to
see
whether
there
was
any
other
outlet
than
the
doorway
but
he
could
discern
none
except
a
narrow
grated
loophole
opening
upon
the
passage
and
contrived
doubtless
for
the
admission
of
air
to
the
chamber
no
dungeon
could
be
more
secure
raising
the
lamp
he
examined
every
crevice
but
all
seemed
solid
stone
the
recess
in
which
he
had
taken
shelter
proved
to
be
a
mere
hollow
in
the
wall
in
one
corner
lay
a
small
straw
pallet
which
no
doubt
had
formed
the
couch
of
mabel
and
this
together
with
the
stone
bench
and
rude
table
of
the
same
material
constituted
the
sole
furniture
of
the
place
having
taken
this
careful
survey
of
the
cell
wyat
again
sat
down
upon
the
bench
with
the
conviction
that
escape
was
out
of
the
question
and
he
therefore
endeavoured
to
prepare
himself
for
the
worst
for
it
was
more
than
probable
he
would
be
allowed
to
perish
of
starvation
to
a
fiery
nature
like
his
the
dreadful
uncertainty
in
which
he
was
placed
was
more
difficult
of
endurance
than
bodily
torture
and
he
was
destined
to
endure
it
long
many
hours
flew
by
during
which
nothing
occurred
to
relieve
the
terrible
monotony
of
his
situation
at
length
in
spite
of
his
anxiety
slumber
stole
upon
him
unawares
but
it
was
filled
with
frightful
visions
how
long
he
slept
he
knew
not
but
when
he
awoke
he
found
that
the
cell
must
have
been
visited
in
the
interval
for
there
was
a
manchet
of
bread
part
of
a
cold
neck
of
venison
and
a
flask
of
wine
on
the
table
it
was
evident
therefore
that
his
captors
did
not
mean
to
starve
him
and
yielding
to
the
promptings
of
appetite
he
attacked
the
provisions
determined
to
keep
strict
watch
when
his
gaoler
should
next
visit
him
the
repast
finished
he
again
examined
the
cell
but
with
no
better
success
than
before
and
he
felt
almost
certain
from
the
position
in
which
the
bench
was
placed
that
the
visitor
had
not
found
entrance
through
the
door
after
another
long
and
dreary
interval
finding
that
sleep
was
stealing
upon
him
fast
he
placed
the
bench
near
the
door
and
leaned
his
back
against
the
latter
certain
that
in
this
position
he
should
be
awakened
if
any
one
attempted
to
gain
admittance
in
that
way
his
slumber
was
again
disturbed
by
fearful
dreams
and
he
was
at
length
aroused
by
a
touch
upon
the
shoulder
while
a
deep
voice
shouted
his
own
name
in
her
ears
starting
to
his
feet
and
scarcely
able
to
separate
the
reality
from
the
hideous
phantasms
that
had
troubled
him
he
found
that
the
door
was
still
fastened
and
the
bench
unremoved
while
before
him
stood
herne
the
hunter
welcome
again
to
my
cave
sir
thomas
wyat
cried
the
demon
with
a
mocking
laugh
i
told
you
on
the
night
of
the
attempt
upon
the
king
that
though
you
escaped
him
you
would
not
escape
me
and
so
it
has
come
to
pass
you
are
now
wholly
in
my
power
body
and
soul
ha
ha
i
defy
you
false
fiend
replied
wyat
i
was
mad
enough
to
proffer
you
my
soul
on
certain
conditions
but
they
have
never
been
they
may
yet
be
so
rejoined
herne
no
replied
wyat
i
have
purged
my
heart
from
the
fierce
and
unhallowed
passion
that
swayed
it
i
desire
no
assistance
from
if
you
have
changed
your
mind
that
is
nought
to
me
rejoined
the
demon
derisively
i
shall
hold
you
to
your
again
i
say
i
renounce
you
infernal
spirit
cried
wyat
you
may
destroy
my
body
but
you
can
work
no
mischief
to
my
you
alarm
yourself
without
reason
good
sir
thomas
replied
herne
in
a
slightly
sneering
tone
i
am
not
the
malignant
being
you
suppose
me
neither
am
i
bent
upon
fighting
the
battles
of
the
enemy
of
mankind
against
heaven
i
may
be
leagued
with
the
powers
of
darkness
but
i
have
no
wish
to
aid
them
and
i
therefore
leave
you
to
take
care
of
your
soul
in
your
own
way
what
i
desire
from
you
is
your
service
while
living
now
listen
to
the
conditions
i
have
to
propose
you
must
bind
yourself
by
a
terrible
oath
the
slightest
infraction
of
which
shall
involve
the
perdition
of
the
soul
you
are
so
solicitous
to
preserve
not
to
disclose
aught
you
may
see
or
that
may
be
imparted
to
you
here
you
must
also
swear
implicit
obedience
to
me
in
all
things
to
execute
any
secret
commissions
of
whatever
nature
i
may
give
you
to
bring
associates
to
my
band
and
to
join
me
in
any
enterprise
i
may
propose
this
oath
taken
you
are
free
refuse
it
and
i
leave
you
to
i
do
refuse
it
replied
wyat
boldly
i
would
die
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
so
bind
myself
neither
do
i
fear
being
left
to
perish
here
you
shall
not
quit
this
cell
without
you
are
a
stout
soldier
sir
thomas
wyat
rejoined
the
demon
with
a
scornful
laugh
but
you
are
scarcely
a
match
for
herne
the
hunter
as
you
will
find
if
you
are
rash
enough
to
make
the
experiment
beware
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
thunder
observing
the
knight
lay
his
hand
upon
his
sword
i
am
invulnerable
and
you
will
therefore
vainly
strike
at
me
do
not
compel
me
to
use
the
dread
means
which
i
could
instantly
employ
to
subject
you
to
my
will
i
mean
you
well
and
would
rather
serve
than
injure
you
but
i
will
not
let
you
go
unless
you
league
yourself
with
me
swear
therefore
obedience
to
me
and
depart
hence
to
your
friends
surrey
and
richmond
and
tell
them
you
have
failed
to
find
you
know
then
of
our
meeting
exclaimed
wyat
perfectly
well
laughed
herne
it
is
now
eventide
and
at
midnight
the
meeting
will
take
place
in
the
forester
hut
if
you
attend
it
not
i
will
they
will
be
my
prisoners
as
well
as
you
to
preserve
yourself
and
save
them
you
must
join
before
i
return
an
answer
said
wyat
i
must
know
what
has
become
of
mabel
mabel
lyndwood
is
nought
to
you
sir
thomas
rejoined
herne
coldly
she
is
so
much
to
me
that
i
will
run
a
risk
for
her
which
i
would
not
run
for
myself
replied
wyat
if
i
promise
obedience
to
you
will
you
liberate
her
will
you
let
her
depart
with
me
no
said
herne
peremptorily
banish
all
thoughts
of
her
from
your
breast
you
will
never
behold
her
again
i
will
give
you
time
for
reflection
on
my
proposal
an
hour
before
midnight
i
shall
return
and
if
i
find
you
in
the
same
mind
i
abandon
you
to
your
and
with
these
words
he
stepped
back
towards
the
lower
end
of
the
cell
wyat
instantly
sprang
after
him
but
before
he
could
reach
him
a
flash
of
fire
caused
him
to
recoil
and
to
his
horror
and
amazement
he
beheld
the
rock
open
and
yield
a
passage
to
the
retreating
figure
when
the
sulphureous
smoke
with
which
the
little
cell
was
filled
had
in
some
degree
cleared
off
wyat
examined
the
sides
of
the
rock
but
could
not
find
the
slightest
trace
of
a
secret
outlet
and
therefore
concluded
that
the
disappearance
of
the
demon
had
been
effected
by
magic
how
mabel
escaped
from
the
cave
with
sir
thomas
wyat
the
next
day
mabel
was
set
at
liberty
by
her
gaoler
and
the
hours
flew
by
without
the
opportunity
of
escape
for
which
she
sighed
occurring
to
her
as
night
drew
on
she
became
more
anxious
and
at
last
expressed
a
wish
to
retire
to
her
cell
when
about
to
fasten
the
door
fenwolf
found
that
the
lock
had
got
strained
and
the
bolts
would
not
move
and
he
was
therefore
obliged
to
content
himself
with
placing
a
bench
against
it
on
which
he
took
a
seat
about
an
hour
after
mabel
retirement
old
tristram
offered
to
relieve
guard
with
fenwolf
but
this
the
other
positively
declined
and
leaning
against
the
door
disposed
himself
to
slumber
tristram
then
threw
himself
on
the
floor
and
in
a
short
time
all
seemed
buried
in
repose
however
when
fenwolf
heavy
breathing
gave
token
of
the
soundness
of
his
sleep
tristram
raised
himself
upon
his
elbow
and
gazed
round
the
lamp
placed
upon
the
table
imperfectly
illumined
the
cavern
for
the
fire
which
had
been
lighted
to
cook
the
evening
meal
had
gone
out
completely
getting
up
cautiously
and
drawing
his
the
old
man
crept
towards
fenwolf
apparently
with
the
intent
of
stabbing
him
but
he
suddenly
changed
his
resolution
and
dropped
his
arm
at
that
moment
as
if
preternaturally
warned
fenwolf
opened
his
eyes
and
seeing
the
old
forester
standing
by
sprang
upon
him
and
seized
him
by
the
throat
ah
traitor
he
exclaimed
what
are
you
about
to
do
i
am
no
traitor
replied
the
old
man
i
heard
a
noise
in
the
passage
leading
to
wyat
cell
and
was
about
to
rouse
you
when
you
awakened
of
your
own
accord
probably
disturbed
by
the
it
may
be
replied
fenwolf
satisfied
with
the
excuse
and
relinquishing
his
grasp
i
fancied
i
heard
something
in
my
dreams
but
come
with
me
to
wyat
cell
i
will
not
leave
you
and
snatching
up
the
lamp
he
hurried
with
tristram
into
the
passage
they
were
scarcely
gone
when
the
door
of
the
cell
was
opened
by
mabel
who
had
overheard
what
had
passed
and
so
hurriedly
did
she
issue
forth
that
she
the
bench
which
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
considerable
clatter
she
had
only
just
time
to
replace
it
and
to
conceal
herself
in
an
adjoining
passage
when
fenwolf
rushed
back
into
the
cavern
it
was
a
false
alarm
he
cried
i
saw
sir
thomas
wyat
in
his
cell
through
the
and
i
have
brought
the
key
away
with
me
but
i
am
sure
i
heard
a
noise
it
must
have
been
mere
fancy
said
tristram
all
is
as
we
left
it
seems
so
certes
replied
fenwolf
doubtfully
but
i
will
make
while
he
placed
his
ear
to
the
door
mabel
gave
a
signal
to
tristram
that
she
was
safe
persuaded
that
he
heard
some
sound
in
the
chamber
fenwolf
nodded
to
tristram
that
all
was
right
and
resumed
his
seat
in
less
than
ten
minutes
he
was
again
asleep
mabel
then
emerged
from
her
concealment
and
cautiously
approached
tristram
who
feigned
also
to
slumber
as
she
approached
him
he
rose
noiselessly
to
his
feet
the
plan
has
succeeded
he
said
in
a
low
tone
it
was
i
who
spoiled
the
lock
but
come
with
me
i
will
lead
you
out
of
the
not
without
sir
thomas
wyat
she
replied
i
will
not
leave
him
you
will
only
expose
yourself
to
risk
and
fail
to
deliver
him
rejoined
tristram
fenwolf
has
the
key
of
his
cell
nay
if
you
are
determined
upon
it
i
will
not
hinder
you
but
you
must
find
your
own
way
out
for
i
shall
not
assist
sir
thomas
motioning
him
to
silence
mabel
crept
slowly
and
on
the
points
of
her
feet
towards
fenwolf
the
key
was
in
his
girdle
leaning
over
him
she
suddenly
and
dexterously
plucked
it
forth
at
the
very
moment
she
possessed
herself
of
it
fenwolf
stirred
and
she
dived
down
and
concealed
herself
beneath
the
table
fenwolf
who
had
been
only
slightly
disturbed
looked
up
and
seeing
tristram
in
his
former
position
which
he
had
resumed
when
mabel
commenced
her
task
again
disposed
himself
to
slumber
waiting
till
she
was
assured
of
the
soundness
of
his
repose
mabel
crept
from
under
the
table
signed
to
tristram
to
remain
where
he
was
and
glided
with
swift
and
noiseless
footsteps
down
the
passage
leading
to
the
cell
in
a
moment
she
was
at
the
door
the
key
was
in
the
lock
and
she
stood
before
sir
thomas
wyat
a
few
words
sufficed
to
explain
to
the
astonished
knight
how
she
came
there
and
comprehending
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
he
followed
her
forth
in
the
passage
they
held
a
brief
consultation
together
in
a
low
tone
as
to
the
best
means
of
escape
for
they
deemed
it
useless
to
apply
to
tristram
the
outlet
with
which
sir
thomas
wyat
was
acquainted
lay
on
the
other
side
of
the
cavern
nor
did
he
know
how
to
discover
the
particular
passage
leading
to
it
as
to
mabel
she
could
offer
no
information
but
she
knew
that
the
stable
lay
in
an
adjoining
passage
recollecting
from
former
experience
how
well
the
steeds
were
trained
sir
thomas
wyat
eagerly
caught
at
the
suggestion
and
mabel
led
him
farther
down
the
passage
and
striking
off
through
an
opening
on
the
left
brought
him
after
a
few
turns
to
a
large
chamber
in
which
two
or
three
black
horses
were
kept
loosening
one
of
them
wyat
placed
a
bridle
on
his
neck
sprang
upon
his
back
and
took
up
mabel
beside
him
he
then
struck
his
heels
against
the
sides
of
the
animal
who
needed
no
further
incitement
to
dash
along
the
passage
and
in
a
few
seconds
brought
them
into
the
cavern
the
trampling
of
the
horse
wakened
fenwolf
who
started
to
his
feet
and
ran
after
them
shouting
furiously
but
he
was
too
late
goaded
by
wyat
dagger
the
steed
dashed
furiously
on
and
plunging
with
its
double
burden
into
the
pool
at
the
bottom
of
the
cavern
disappeared
vi
of
the
desperate
resolution
formed
by
tristram
and
fenwolf
and
how
the
train
was
laid
transported
with
rage
at
the
escape
of
the
fugitives
fenwolf
turned
to
old
tristram
and
drawing
his
knife
threatened
to
make
an
end
of
him
but
the
old
man
who
was
armed
with
a
short
stood
upon
his
defence
and
they
remained
brandishing
their
weapons
at
each
other
for
some
minutes
but
without
striking
a
blow
well
i
leave
you
to
herne
vengeance
said
fenwolf
returning
his
knife
to
his
belt
you
will
pay
dearly
for
allowing
them
to
i
will
take
my
chance
replied
tristram
moodily
my
mind
is
made
up
to
the
worst
i
will
no
longer
serve
this
what
dare
you
break
your
oath
cried
fenwolf
remember
the
terrible
i
care
not
for
them
replied
tristram
harkee
fenwolf
i
know
you
will
not
betray
me
for
you
hate
him
as
much
as
i
do
and
have
as
great
a
desire
for
revenge
i
will
rid
the
forest
of
this
fell
would
you
could
make
good
your
words
old
man
cried
fenwolf
i
would
give
my
life
for
vengeance
upon
i
take
the
offer
said
tristram
you
shall
have
but
how
cried
the
other
i
have
proved
that
he
is
invulnerable
and
the
prints
of
his
hands
are
written
in
black
characters
upon
my
throat
if
we
could
capture
him
and
deliver
him
to
the
king
we
might
purchase
our
own
no
that
can
never
be
said
tristram
my
plan
is
to
destroy
well
let
me
hear
it
said
fenwolf
come
with
me
then
rejoined
tristram
and
taking
up
the
lamp
he
led
the
way
down
a
narrow
lateral
passage
when
about
down
it
he
stopped
before
a
low
door
cased
with
iron
which
he
opened
and
showed
that
the
recess
was
filled
with
large
canvas
bags
why
this
is
the
said
fenwolf
i
can
now
guess
how
you
mean
to
destroy
herne
i
like
the
scheme
well
enough
but
it
can
not
be
executed
without
certain
destruction
to
i
will
take
all
the
risk
upon
myself
said
tristram
i
only
require
your
aid
in
the
preparations
what
i
propose
to
do
is
this
there
is
powder
enough
in
the
magazine
not
only
to
blow
up
the
cave
but
to
set
fire
to
all
the
wood
surrounding
it
it
must
be
scattered
among
the
dry
in
a
great
circle
round
the
cave
and
connected
by
a
train
with
this
magazine
when
herne
comes
hack
i
will
fire
the
there
is
much
hazard
in
the
scheme
and
i
fear
it
will
fail
replied
fenwolf
after
a
pause
nevertheless
i
will
assist
then
let
us
go
to
work
at
once
said
tristram
for
we
have
no
time
to
lose
herne
will
be
here
before
midnight
and
i
should
like
to
have
all
ready
for
accordingly
they
each
shouldered
a
couple
of
the
bags
and
returning
to
the
cavern
threaded
a
narrow
passage
and
emerged
from
the
secret
entrance
in
the
grove
while
fenwolf
descended
for
a
fresh
supply
of
powder
tristram
commenced
operations
though
autumn
was
now
far
advanced
there
had
been
remarkably
fine
weather
of
late
the
ground
was
thickly
strewn
with
yellow
leaves
the
fern
was
brown
and
dry
and
the
brushwood
crackled
and
broke
as
a
passage
was
forced
through
it
the
very
trees
were
parched
by
the
drought
thus
favoured
in
his
design
tristram
scattered
the
contents
of
one
of
the
bags
in
a
thick
line
among
the
fern
and
brushwood
depositing
here
and
there
among
the
roots
of
a
tree
several
pounds
of
powder
and
covering
the
heaps
over
with
dried
sticks
and
leaves
while
he
was
thus
employed
fenwolf
appeared
with
two
more
bags
of
powder
and
descended
again
for
a
fresh
supply
when
he
returned
laden
as
before
the
old
forester
had
already
described
a
large
portion
of
the
circle
he
intended
to
take
judging
that
there
was
now
powder
sufficient
tristram
explained
to
his
companion
how
to
proceed
and
the
other
commenced
laying
a
train
on
the
left
of
the
secret
entrance
carefully
observing
the
instructions
given
him
in
less
than
an
hour
they
met
together
at
a
particular
tree
and
the
formidable
circle
was
complete
so
far
well
said
tristram
emptying
the
contents
of
his
bag
beneath
the
tree
and
covering
it
with
leaves
and
sticks
as
before
and
now
to
connect
this
with
the
with
this
he
opened
another
bag
and
drew
a
wide
train
towards
the
centre
of
the
space
at
length
he
paused
at
the
foot
of
a
large
hollow
tree
i
have
ascertained
he
said
that
this
tree
stands
immediately
over
the
magazine
and
by
following
this
rabbit
burrow
i
have
contrived
to
make
a
small
entrance
into
it
a
hollow
reed
introduced
through
the
hole
and
filled
with
powder
will
be
sure
to
reach
the
store
an
excellent
ideal
replied
fenwolf
i
will
fetch
one
and
starting
off
to
the
side
of
the
lake
he
presently
returned
with
several
long
reeds
one
of
which
was
selected
by
tristram
and
thrust
into
the
burrow
it
proved
of
the
precise
length
required
and
as
soon
as
it
touched
the
bottom
it
was
carefully
filled
with
powder
from
a
horn
having
connected
this
tube
with
the
side
train
and
scattered
powder
for
several
yards
around
so
as
to
secure
instantaneous
ignition
tristram
pronounced
that
the
train
was
complete
we
have
now
laid
a
trap
from
which
herne
will
scarcely
escape
he
observed
with
a
moody
laugh
to
fenwolf
they
then
prepared
to
return
to
the
cave
but
had
not
proceeded
many
yards
when
herne
mounted
on
his
sable
steed
burst
through
the
trees
ah
what
make
you
here
he
cried
instantly
checking
his
career
i
bade
you
keep
a
strict
watch
over
mabel
where
is
she
she
has
escaped
with
sir
thomas
wyat
replied
fenwolf
and
we
have
been
in
search
of
escaped
exclaimed
herne
springing
from
his
steed
and
rushing
up
to
him
dogs
you
have
played
me
false
but
your
lives
shall
pay
the
penalty
of
your
we
had
no
hand
in
it
whatever
replied
fenwolf
doggedly
she
contrived
to
get
out
of
a
chamber
in
which
i
placed
her
and
to
liberate
sir
thomas
wyat
they
then
procured
a
steed
from
the
stable
and
plunged
through
the
pool
into
the
hell
malison
upon
them
and
upon
you
both
cried
herne
but
you
shall
pay
dearly
for
your
heedlessness
if
indeed
it
has
not
been
something
worse
how
long
have
they
been
gone
it
may
be
two
hours
replied
fenwolf
go
to
the
cave
cried
herne
and
await
my
return
there
and
if
i
recover
not
the
prize
woe
betide
you
both
and
with
these
words
he
vaunted
upon
his
steed
and
disappeared
and
woe
betide
you
too
false
fiend
cried
fenwolf
when
you
come
back
you
shall
meet
with
a
welcome
you
little
expect
would
we
had
fired
the
train
tristram
even
though
we
had
perished
with
him
it
will
be
time
enough
to
fire
it
on
his
return
replied
the
old
forester
it
is
but
postponing
our
vengeance
for
a
short
time
and
now
to
fix
our
positions
i
will
take
my
station
in
yon
and
i
in
that
hollow
tree
said
fenwolf
whoever
first
beholds
him
shall
fire
the
agreed
replied
tristram
let
us
now
descend
to
the
cave
and
see
that
all
is
right
in
the
magazine
and
then
we
will
return
and
hold
ourselves
in
readiness
for
vii
how
the
train
was
fired
and
what
followed
the
explosion
about
ten
in
the
night
under
consideration
surrey
and
richmond
accompanied
by
the
duke
of
shoreditch
and
half
a
dozen
other
archers
set
out
from
the
castle
and
took
their
way
along
the
great
park
in
the
direction
of
the
lake
they
had
not
ridden
far
when
they
were
overtaken
by
two
horsemen
who
as
far
as
they
could
be
discerned
in
that
doubtful
light
appeared
stalwart
personages
and
well
mounted
though
plainly
attired
the
very
unceremoniously
joined
them
there
are
ill
reports
of
the
park
my
masters
said
the
foremost
of
these
persons
to
surrey
and
we
would
willingly
ride
with
you
across
but
our
way
may
not
be
yours
friend
replied
surrey
who
did
not
altogether
relish
this
proposal
we
are
not
going
farther
than
the
our
road
lies
in
that
direction
replied
the
other
and
if
you
please
we
will
bear
you
company
as
far
as
we
go
come
tell
me
frankly
he
added
after
a
pause
are
you
not
in
search
of
herne
the
hunter
why
do
you
ask
friend
rejoined
the
earl
somewhat
angrily
because
if
so
replied
the
other
i
shall
be
right
glad
to
join
you
and
so
will
my
friend
tony
cryspyn
who
is
close
behind
me
i
have
an
old
grudge
to
settle
with
this
herne
who
has
more
than
once
attacked
me
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
pay
if
you
will
take
my
advice
hugh
dacre
you
will
ride
on
and
leave
the
achievement
of
the
adventure
to
these
young
galliards
interposed
cryspyn
nay
by
the
mass
that
shall
never
be
rejoined
dacre
if
they
have
no
objection
to
our
joining
them
if
they
have
they
have
only
to
say
so
and
we
will
go
i
will
be
plain
with
you
my
masters
said
surrey
we
are
determined
this
night
as
you
have
rightly
conjectured
to
seek
out
herne
the
hunter
and
we
hope
to
obtain
such
clue
to
him
as
will
ensure
his
capture
if
therefore
you
are
anxious
to
join
us
we
shall
be
glad
of
your
aid
but
you
must
be
content
to
follow
and
not
lead
and
to
act
as
you
are
directed
or
you
will
only
be
in
the
way
and
we
would
rather
dispense
with
your
we
are
content
with
the
terms
are
we
not
tony
said
dacre
his
companion
answered
somewhat
sullenly
in
the
affirmative
and
now
that
the
matter
is
arranged
may
i
ask
when
you
propose
to
go
he
continued
we
are
on
our
way
to
a
hut
on
the
lake
where
we
expect
a
companion
to
join
us
replied
surrey
what
tristram
lyndwood
cottage
demanded
dacre
ay
replied
the
earl
and
we
hope
to
recover
his
fair
granddaughter
from
the
power
of
the
ha
say
you
so
cried
dacre
that
were
a
feat
indeed
the
two
strangers
then
rode
apart
for
a
few
moments
and
conversed
together
in
a
low
tone
during
which
richmond
expressed
his
doubts
of
them
to
surrey
adding
that
he
was
determined
to
get
rid
of
them
the
however
were
not
easily
shaken
off
as
soon
as
they
perceived
the
duke
design
they
stuck
more
pertinaciously
to
him
and
the
earl
than
before
and
made
it
evident
they
would
not
be
dismissed
by
this
time
they
had
passed
spring
hill
and
were
within
a
mile
of
the
valley
in
which
lay
the
marsh
when
a
cry
for
help
was
heard
in
the
thicket
on
the
left
and
the
troop
immediately
halted
the
cry
was
repeated
and
surrey
bidding
the
others
follow
him
dashed
off
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
presently
they
perceived
two
figures
beneath
the
trees
whom
they
found
on
a
nearer
approach
were
sir
thomas
wyat
with
mabel
in
a
state
of
insensibility
in
his
arms
dismounting
by
the
side
of
his
friend
surrey
hastily
demanded
how
he
came
there
and
what
had
happened
it
is
too
long
a
story
to
relate
now
said
wyat
but
the
sum
of
it
is
that
i
have
escaped
by
the
aid
of
this
damsel
from
the
clutches
of
the
demon
our
escape
was
effected
on
horseback
and
we
had
to
plunge
into
the
lake
the
immersion
deprived
my
fair
preserver
of
sensibility
so
that
as
soon
as
i
landed
and
gained
a
covert
where
i
fancied
myself
secure
i
dismounted
and
tried
to
restore
her
while
i
was
thus
occupied
the
steed
i
had
brought
with
me
broke
his
bridle
and
darted
off
into
the
woods
after
a
while
mabel
opened
her
eyes
but
she
was
so
weak
that
she
could
not
move
and
i
was
fain
to
make
her
a
couch
in
the
fern
in
the
hope
that
she
would
speedily
revive
but
the
fright
and
suffering
had
been
too
much
for
her
and
a
succession
of
followed
during
which
i
thought
she
would
expire
this
is
all
now
let
us
prepare
a
litter
for
her
and
convey
her
where
proper
assistance
can
be
meanwhile
the
others
had
come
up
and
hugh
dacre
flinging
himself
from
his
horse
and
pushing
surrey
somewhat
rudely
aside
advanced
towards
mabel
and
taking
her
hand
said
in
a
voice
of
some
emotion
alas
poor
girl
i
did
not
expect
to
meet
thee
again
in
this
you
knew
her
then
said
surrey
dacre
muttered
an
affirmative
who
is
this
man
asked
wyat
of
the
earl
i
know
him
not
answered
surrey
he
joined
us
on
the
road
i
am
well
known
to
sir
thomas
wyat
replied
dacre
in
a
significant
tone
as
he
will
avouch
when
i
recall
certain
matters
to
his
mind
but
do
not
let
us
lose
time
here
this
damsel
claims
our
first
attention
she
must
be
conveyed
to
a
place
of
safety
and
where
she
can
be
well
tended
we
can
then
return
to
search
for
upon
this
a
litter
of
branches
were
speedily
made
and
mabel
being
laid
upon
it
the
simple
conveyance
was
sustained
by
four
of
the
archers
the
little
cavalcade
then
quitted
the
thicket
and
began
to
retrace
its
course
towards
the
castle
wyat
had
been
accommodated
with
a
horse
by
one
of
the
archers
and
rode
in
a
melancholy
manner
by
the
side
of
the
litter
they
had
got
back
nearly
as
far
as
the
brow
of
spring
hill
when
a
horseman
in
a
wild
garb
and
mounted
on
a
coal
black
steed
lashed
suddenly
and
at
a
furious
pace
out
of
the
trees
on
the
right
he
made
towards
the
litter
sir
thomas
wyat
and
before
any
opposition
could
be
offered
him
seized
the
inanimate
form
of
mabel
and
placing
her
before
him
on
his
steed
dashed
off
as
swiftly
as
he
came
and
with
a
burst
of
loud
exulting
laughter
it
is
herne
it
is
herne
burst
from
every
lip
and
they
all
started
in
pursuit
urging
the
horses
to
their
utmost
speed
sir
thomas
wyat
had
instantly
remounted
his
steed
and
he
came
up
with
the
others
herne
triumphant
and
demoniacal
laugh
was
heard
as
he
scoured
with
the
swiftness
of
the
wind
down
the
long
glade
but
the
fiercest
determination
animated
his
pursuers
who
being
all
admirably
mounted
managed
to
keep
him
fully
in
view
away
away
he
speeded
in
the
direction
of
the
lake
and
after
him
they
thundered
straining
every
sinew
in
the
desperate
chase
it
was
a
wild
and
extraordinary
sight
and
partook
of
the
fantastical
character
of
a
dream
at
length
herne
reached
the
acclivity
at
the
foot
of
which
lay
the
waters
of
the
lake
glimmering
in
the
starlight
and
by
the
time
he
had
descended
to
its
foot
his
pursuers
had
gained
its
brow
the
exertions
made
by
sir
thomas
wyat
had
brought
him
a
little
in
advance
of
the
others
furiously
goading
his
horse
he
dashed
down
the
hillside
at
a
terrific
pace
all
at
once
as
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
flying
figure
of
the
demon
he
was
startled
by
a
sudden
burst
of
flame
in
the
valley
a
wide
circle
of
light
was
rapidly
described
a
rumbling
sound
was
heard
like
that
preceding
an
and
a
tremendous
explosion
followed
hurling
trees
and
fragments
of
rock
into
the
air
astounded
at
the
extraordinary
occurrence
and
not
knowing
what
might
ensue
the
pursuers
reined
in
their
steeds
but
the
terror
of
the
scene
was
not
yet
over
the
whole
of
the
brushwood
had
caught
fire
and
blazed
up
with
the
fury
and
swiftness
of
lighted
flax
the
flames
caught
the
parched
branches
of
the
trees
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
whole
grove
was
on
fire
the
sight
was
awfully
grand
for
the
wind
which
was
blowing
strongly
swept
the
flames
forward
so
that
they
devoured
all
before
them
when
the
first
flash
was
seen
the
demon
had
checked
his
steed
and
backed
him
so
that
he
had
escaped
without
injury
and
he
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
flaming
circle
watching
the
progress
of
the
devastating
element
but
at
last
finding
that
his
pursuers
had
taken
heart
and
were
approaching
him
he
bestirred
himself
and
rode
round
the
blazing
zone
having
by
this
time
recovered
from
their
surprise
wyat
and
surrey
dashed
after
him
and
got
so
near
him
that
they
made
sure
of
his
capture
but
at
the
very
moment
they
expected
to
reach
him
he
turned
his
horse
head
and
forced
him
to
leap
over
the
blazing
boundary
in
vain
the
pursuers
attempted
to
follow
their
horses
refused
to
encounter
the
flames
while
wyat
steed
urged
on
by
its
frantic
master
reared
bolt
upright
and
dislodged
him
but
the
demon
held
on
his
way
apparently
unscathed
in
the
midst
of
the
flames
casting
a
look
of
grim
defiance
at
his
pursuers
as
he
passed
a
tree
from
which
volumes
of
fire
were
bursting
the
most
appalling
shrieks
reached
his
ear
and
he
beheld
morgan
fenwolf
emerging
from
a
hole
in
the
trunk
but
without
bestowing
more
than
a
glance
upon
his
unfortunate
follower
he
dashed
forward
and
becoming
involved
in
the
wreaths
of
flame
and
smoke
was
lost
to
sight
attracted
by
fenwolf
cries
the
beholders
perceived
him
crawl
out
of
the
hole
and
clamber
into
the
upper
part
of
the
tree
where
he
roared
to
them
most
piteously
for
aid
but
even
if
they
had
been
disposed
to
render
it
it
was
impossible
to
do
so
now
and
after
terrible
and
protracted
suffering
the
poor
wretch
half
stifled
with
smoke
and
unable
longer
to
maintain
his
hold
of
the
branch
to
which
he
crept
fell
into
the
flames
beneath
and
perished
attributing
its
outbreak
to
supernatural
agency
the
party
gazed
on
in
wonder
at
the
fire
and
rode
round
it
as
closely
as
their
steeds
would
allow
them
but
though
they
tarried
till
the
flames
had
abated
and
little
was
left
of
the
noble
grove
but
a
collection
of
charred
and
smoking
stumps
nothing
was
seen
of
the
fiend
or
of
the
hapless
girl
he
had
carried
off
it
served
to
confirm
the
notion
of
the
supernatural
origin
of
the
fire
in
that
it
was
confined
within
the
mystic
circle
and
did
not
extend
farther
into
the
woods
at
the
time
that
the
flames
first
burst
forth
and
revealed
the
countenances
of
the
lookers
on
it
was
discovered
that
the
dacre
and
cryspyn
were
no
other
than
the
king
and
the
duke
of
suffolk
if
this
mysterious
being
is
mortal
he
must
have
perished
now
observed
henry
and
if
he
is
not
it
is
useless
to
seek
for
him
day
had
begun
to
break
as
the
party
quitted
the
scene
of
devastation
the
king
and
suffolk
with
the
archers
returned
to
the
castle
but
wyat
surrey
and
richmond
rode
towards
the
lake
and
proceeded
along
its
banks
in
the
direction
of
the
forester
hut
their
progress
was
suddenly
arrested
by
the
sound
of
lamentation
and
they
perceived
in
a
little
bay
overhung
by
trees
which
screened
it
from
the
path
an
old
man
kneeling
beside
the
body
of
a
female
which
he
had
partly
dragged
out
of
the
lake
it
was
tristram
lyndwood
and
the
body
was
that
of
mabel
her
tresses
were
dishevelled
and
dripping
with
wet
as
were
her
garments
and
her
features
white
as
marble
the
old
man
was
weeping
bitterly
with
wyat
to
dismount
and
grasp
the
cold
hand
of
the
hapless
maiden
was
the
work
of
a
moment
she
is
dead
he
cried
in
a
despairing
voice
removing
the
dank
tresses
from
her
brow
and
imprinting
a
reverent
kiss
upon
it
dead
lost
to
me
for
ever
i
found
her
entangled
among
those
said
tristram
in
tones
broken
by
emotion
and
had
just
dragged
her
to
shore
when
you
came
up
as
you
hope
to
prosper
now
and
hereafter
give
her
a
decent
burial
for
me
all
is
and
with
a
lamentable
cry
he
plunged
into
the
lake
struck
out
to
a
short
distance
and
then
sank
to
rise
no
more
thus
ends

fifth

attachment
to
jane
seymour
on
the
anniversary
of
saint
george
and
exactly
seven
years
from
the
opening
of
this
chronicle
henry
assembled
the
within
windsor
castle
to
hold
the
grand
feast
of
the
most
noble
order
of
the
garter
many
important
events
had
occurred
in
the
wide
interval
thus
suffered
to
elapse
wolsey
had
long
since
sunk
under
his
reverses
for
he
never
regained
the
royal
favour
after
his
dismissal
and
had
expired
at
leicester
abbey
on
the
november
but
the
sufferings
of
catherine
of
arragon
were
prolonged
up
to
the
commencement
of
the
year
under
consideration
after
the
divorce
and
the
elevation
of
anne
boleyn
to
the
throne
in
her
stead
she
withdrew
to
kimbolten
castle
where
she
dwelt
in
the
greatest
retirement
under
the
style
of
the
princess
dowager
finding
her
end
approaching
she
sent
a
humble
message
to
the
king
imploring
him
to
allow
her
one
last
interview
with
her
daughter
that
she
might
bestow
her
blessing
upon
her
but
the
request
was
refused
a
touching
letter
however
which
she
wrote
to
the
king
on
her
moved
him
to
tears
and
having
ejaculated
a
few
expressions
of
his
sense
of
her
many
noble
qualities
he
retired
to
his
closet
to
indulge
his
grief
in
secret
solemn
obsequies
were
ordered
to
be
performed
at
windsor
and
greenwich
on
the
day
of
her
interment
and
the
king
and
the
whole
of
his
retinue
put
on
mourning
for
her
with
this
arrangement
anne
boleyn
cared
not
to
comply
though
she
had
attained
the
summit
of
her
ambition
though
the
divorce
had
been
pronounced
and
she
was
crowned
queen
though
she
had
given
birth
to
a
daughter
the
princess
elizabeth
afterwards
the
illustrious
queen
of
that
name
two
years
before
and
though
she
could
have
no
reasonable
apprehensions
from
her
the
injured
catherine
during
her
lifetime
had
always
been
an
object
of
dread
to
her
she
heard
of
her
death
with
undisguised
satisfaction
clapped
her
hands
exclaiming
to
her
attendants
now
i
am
indeed
queen
and
put
the
crowning
point
to
her
unfeeling
conduct
by
decorating
herself
and
her
dames
in
the
gayest
apparel
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
alas
she
little
knew
that
at
that
very
moment
the
work
of
retribution
commenced
and
that
the
wrongs
of
the
injured
queen
whose
memory
she
thus
outraged
were
soon
to
be
terribly
and
bloodily
avenged
other
changes
had
likewise
taken
place
which
may
be
here
recorded
the
earl
of
surrey
had
made
the
tour
of
france
italy
and
the
empire
and
had
fully
kept
his
word
by
proclaiming
the
supremacy
of
the
fair
geraldine
beauty
at
all
tilts
and
tournaments
at
which
he
constantly
bore
away
the
prize
but
the
greatest
reward
and
that
which
he
hoped
would
crown
his
fidelity
the
hand
of
his
mistress
was
not
reserved
for
him
at
the
expiration
of
three
years
he
returned
home
polished
by
travel
and
accounted
one
of
the
bravest
and
most
accomplished
cavaliers
of
the
day
his
reputation
had
preceded
him
and
he
was
received
with
marks
of
the
highest
distinction
and
favour
by
henry
as
well
as
by
anne
boleyn
but
the
king
was
still
averse
to
the
match
and
forbade
the
fair
geraldine
to
return
to
court
finding
so
much
opposition
on
all
sides
the
earl
was
at
last
brought
to
assent
to
the
wish
of
the
fair
geraldine
that
their
engagement
should
be
broken
off
in
her
letters
she
assured
him
that
her
love
had
undergone
no
abatement
and
never
would
do
so
but
that
she
felt
they
must
give
up
all
idea
of
an
union
these
letters
probably
the
result
of
some
manoeuvring
on
his
own
part
set
on
foot
by
the
royal
mandate
were
warmly
seconded
by
the
duke
of
norfolk
and
after
many
and
long
solicitations
he
succeeded
in
wringing
from
his
son
a
reluctant
acquiescence
to
the
arrangement
the
disappointment
produced
its
natural
consequences
on
the
ardent
temperament
of
the
young
earl
and
completely
chilled
and
blighted
his
feelings
he
became
moody
and
discontented
took
little
share
in
the
amusement
and
pastimes
going
forward
and
from
being
the
blithest
cavalier
at
court
became
the
saddest
the
change
in
his
demeanour
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
anne
boleyn
who
easily
divined
the
cause
and
she
essayed
by
raillery
and
other
arts
to
wean
him
from
his
grief
but
all
was
for
some
time
of
no
avail
the
earl
continued
inconsolable
at
last
however
by
the
instrumentality
of
the
queen
and
his
father
he
was
contracted
to
the
lady
frances
vere
daughter
of
the
earl
of
oxford
and
was
married
to
her
in
long
before
this
the
duke
of
richmond
had
been
wedded
to
the
lady
mary
howard
for
some
time
previous
to
the
present
era
of
this
chronicle
anne
boleyn
had
observed
a
growing
coolness
towards
her
on
the
part
of
the
king
and
latterly
it
had
become
evident
that
his
passion
for
her
was
fast
subsiding
if
indeed
it
had
not
altogether
expired
though
anne
had
never
truly
loved
her
royal
consort
and
though
at
that
very
time
she
was
secretly
encouraging
the
regards
of
another
she
felt
troubled
by
this
change
and
watched
all
the
king
movements
with
jealous
anxiety
to
ascertain
if
any
one
had
supplanted
her
in
his
affections
at
length
her
vigilance
was
rewarded
by
discovering
a
rival
in
one
of
the
loveliest
of
her
dames
jane
seymour
this
fair
creature
the
daughter
of
sir
john
seymour
of
wolff
hall
in
wiltshire
and
who
was
afterwards
it
is
almost
needless
to
say
raised
to
as
high
a
dignity
as
anne
boleyn
herself
was
now
in
the
very
pride
of
her
beauty
tall
exquisitely
proportioned
with
a
complexion
of
the
utmost
brilliancy
and
delicacy
large
liquid
blue
eyes
bright
chestnut
tresses
and
lovely
features
she
possessed
charms
that
could
not
fall
to
captivate
the
amorous
monarch
it
seems
marvellous
that
anne
boleyn
should
have
such
an
attendant
but
perhaps
she
felt
confident
in
her
own
attractions
skilled
in
intrigue
herself
anne
now
that
her
eyes
were
opened
perceived
all
the
allurements
thrown
out
by
jane
to
ensnare
the
king
and
she
intercepted
many
a
furtive
glance
between
them
still
she
did
not
dare
to
interfere
the
fierceness
of
henry
temper
kept
her
in
awe
and
she
knew
well
that
the
slightest
opposition
would
only
make
him
the
more
determined
to
run
counter
to
her
will
trusting
therefore
to
get
rid
of
jane
seymour
by
some
stratagem
she
resolved
not
to
attempt
to
dismiss
her
except
as
a
last
resource
a
slight
incident
occurred
which
occasioned
a
departure
from
the
prudent
course
she
had
laid
down
to
herself
accompanied
by
her
dames
she
was
traversing
the
great
gallery
of
the
palace
at
greenwich
when
she
caught
the
reflection
of
jane
seymour
who
was
following
her
in
a
mirror
regarding
a
jewelled
miniature
she
instantly
turned
round
at
the
sight
and
jane
in
great
confusion
thrust
the
picture
into
her
bosom
ah
i
what
have
you
there
cried
anne
a
picture
of
my
father
sir
john
seymour
replied
jane
blushing
deeply
let
me
look
at
it
cried
anne
snatching
the
picture
from
her
ah
call
you
this
your
father
to
my
thinking
it
is
much
more
like
my
royal
husband
answer
me
frankly
minion
answer
me
as
you
value
your
life
did
the
king
give
you
this
i
must
decline
answering
the
question
replied
jane
who
by
this
time
had
recovered
her
composure
ah
am
i
to
be
thus
insolently
treated
by
one
of
my
own
dames
cried
anne
i
intend
no
disrespect
to
your
majesty
replied
jane
and
i
will
since
you
insist
upon
it
freely
confess
that
i
received
the
portrait
from
the
king
i
did
not
conceive
there
could
be
any
harm
in
doing
so
because
i
saw
your
majesty
present
your
own
portrait
the
other
day
to
sir
henry
anne
boleyn
turned
as
pale
as
death
and
jane
seymour
perceived
that
she
had
her
in
her
power
i
gave
the
portrait
to
sir
henry
as
a
recompense
for
an
important
service
he
rendered
me
said
anne
after
a
slight
pause
no
doubt
replied
jane
and
i
marvel
not
that
he
should
press
it
so
fervently
to
his
lips
seeing
he
must
value
the
gift
highly
the
king
likewise
bestowed
his
portrait
upon
me
for
rendering
him
a
and
what
was
that
asked
anne
nay
there
your
majesty
must
hold
me
excused
replied
the
other
it
were
to
betray
his
highness
confidence
to
declare
it
i
must
refer
you
to
him
for
well
you
are
in
the
right
to
keep
the
secret
said
anne
forcing
a
laugh
i
dare
say
there
is
no
harm
in
the
portrait
indeed
i
am
sure
there
is
not
if
it
was
given
with
the
same
intent
that
mine
was
bestowed
upon
norris
and
so
we
will
say
no
more
upon
the
matter
except
that
i
beg
you
to
be
discreet
with
the
king
if
others
should
comment
upon
your
conduct
i
may
be
compelled
to
dismiss
your
majesty
shall
be
obeyed
said
jane
with
a
look
that
intimated
that
the
request
had
but
slight
weight
with
her
catherine
will
be
avenged
by
means
of
this
woman
muttered
anne
as
she
turned
away
i
already
feel
some
of
the
torments
with
which
she
threatened
me
and
she
suspects
norris
i
must
impress
more
caution
on
him
ah
when
a
man
loves
deeply
as
he
loves
me
due
restraint
is
seldom
but
though
alarmed
anne
was
by
no
means
aware
of
the
critical
position
in
which
she
stood
she
could
not
persuade
herself
that
she
had
entirely
lost
her
influence
with
the
king
and
she
thought
that
when
his
momentary
passion
had
subsided
it
would
return
to
its
old
channels
she
was
mistaken
jane
seymour
was
absolute
mistress
of
his
heart
and
anne
was
now
as
great
a
bar
to
him
as
she
had
before
been
an
attraction
had
her
conduct
been
irreproachable
it
might
have
been
difficult
to
remove
her
but
unfortunately
she
had
placed
herself
at
his
mercy
by
yielding
to
the
impulses
of
vanity
and
secretly
encouraging
the
passion
of
sir
henry
norris
groom
of
the
stole
this
favoured
personage
was
somewhat
above
the
middle
size
squarely
and
strongly
built
his
features
were
regularly
and
finely
formed
and
he
had
a
ruddy
complexion
brown
curling
hair
good
teeth
and
fine
eyes
of
a
clear
blue
he
possessed
great
personal
strength
was
expert
in
all
manly
exercises
and
shone
especially
at
the
jousts
and
the
manege
he
was
of
an
ardent
temperament
and
anne
boleyn
had
inspired
him
with
so
desperate
a
passion
that
he
set
at
nought
the
fearful
risk
he
ran
to
obtain
her
favour
in
all
this
seemed
traceable
the
hand
of
fate
in
henry
passion
for
jane
seymour
and
anne
insane
regard
for
norris
as
if
in
this
way
and
by
the
same
means
in
which
she
herself
had
been
wronged
the
injured
catherine
of
arragon
was
to
be
avenged
how
far
henry
suspicions
of
his
consort
regard
for
norris
had
been
roused
did
not
at
the
time
appear
whatever
he
felt
in
secret
he
took
care
that
no
outward
manifestation
should
betray
him
on
the
contrary
he
loaded
norris
who
had
always
been
a
favourite
with
him
with
new
marks
of
regard
and
encouraged
rather
than
interdicted
his
approach
to
the
queen
things
were
in
this
state
when
the
court
proceeded
to
windsor
as
before
related
on
saint
george
day
ii
how
anne
boleyn
received
proof
of
henry
passion
for
jane
seymour
on
the
day
after
the
solemnisation
of
the
grand
feast
of
the
order
of
the
garter
a
masqued
fete
of
great
splendour
and
magnificence
was
held
within
the
castle
the
whole
of
the
state
apartments
were
thrown
open
to
the
distinguished
guests
and
universal
gaiety
prevailed
no
restraint
was
offered
to
the
festivity
by
the
king
for
though
he
was
known
to
be
present
he
did
not
choose
to
declare
himself
the
queen
sat
apart
on
a
fauteuil
in
the
deep
embrasure
of
a
window
and
as
various
companies
of
fantastic
characters
advanced
towards
her
she
more
than
once
fancied
she
detected
amongst
them
the
king
but
the
voices
convinced
her
of
her
mistake
as
the
evening
was
wearing
a
mask
in
a
blue
domino
drew
near
her
and
whispered
in
a
devoted
and
familiar
tone
my
queen
is
it
you
norris
demanded
anne
under
her
breath
it
is
he
replied
oh
madam
i
have
been
gazing
at
you
the
whole
evening
but
have
not
dared
to
approach
you
till
i
am
sorry
you
have
addressed
me
at
all
norris
she
rejoined
your
regard
for
me
has
been
noticed
by
others
and
may
reach
the
king
ears
you
must
promise
never
to
address
me
in
the
language
of
passion
if
i
may
not
utter
my
love
i
shall
go
mad
replied
norris
after
raising
me
to
the
verge
of
paradise
do
not
thrust
me
to
the
depths
of
i
have
neither
raised
you
nor
do
i
cast
you
down
rejoined
anne
that
i
am
sensible
of
your
devotion
and
grateful
for
it
i
admit
but
nothing
more
my
love
and
allegiance
are
due
to
the
true
replied
norris
bitterly
they
are
so
but
he
is
wholly
insensible
to
your
merits
at
this
very
moment
he
is
pouring
his
in
the
ear
of
jane
ah
is
he
so
cried
anne
let
me
have
proof
of
his
perfidy
and
i
may
incline
a
more
favourable
ear
to
i
will
instantly
obtain
you
the
proof
madam
replied
norris
bowing
and
departing
scarcely
had
he
quitted
the
queen
and
mixed
with
the
throng
of
dancers
than
he
felt
a
pressure
upon
his
arm
and
turning
at
the
touch
beheld
a
tall
monk
the
lower
part
of
whose
face
was
muffled
up
leaving
only
a
pair
of
fierce
black
eyes
and
a
large
aquiline
nose
visible
i
know
what
you
want
sir
henry
norris
said
the
tall
monk
in
a
low
deep
voice
you
wish
to
give
the
queen
proof
of
her
royal
inconstancy
it
is
easily
done
come
with
who
are
you
demanded
norris
doubtfully
what
matters
it
who
i
am
rejoined
the
other
i
am
one
of
the
masquers
and
chance
to
know
what
is
passing
around
me
i
do
not
inquire
into
your
motives
and
therefore
you
have
no
right
to
inquire
into
it
is
not
for
my
own
satisfaction
that
i
desire
this
proof
said
norris
because
i
would
rather
shield
the
king
indiscretions
than
betray
them
but
the
queen
has
conceived
suspicions
which
she
is
determined
to
think
not
to
impose
upon
me
replied
the
monk
with
a
sneer
bring
the
queen
this
way
and
she
shall
be
fully
i
can
run
no
risk
in
trusting
you
said
norris
and
therefore
i
accept
your
say
no
more
cried
the
monk
disdainfully
i
will
await
you
and
norris
returned
to
the
queen
have
you
discovered
anything
she
cried
come
with
me
madam
said
norris
bowing
and
taking
her
hand
proceeding
thus
they
glided
through
the
throng
of
dancers
who
respectfully
cleared
a
passage
for
them
as
they
walked
along
until
they
approached
the
spot
where
the
tall
monk
was
standing
as
they
drew
near
him
he
moved
on
and
norris
and
the
queen
followed
in
silence
passing
from
the
great
hall
in
which
the
crowd
of
dancers
were
assembled
they
descended
a
short
flight
of
steps
at
the
foot
of
which
the
monk
paused
and
pointed
with
his
right
hand
to
a
chamber
partly
screened
by
the
folds
of
a
curtain
at
this
intimation
the
queen
and
her
companion
stepped
quickly
on
and
as
she
advanced
anne
boleyn
perceived
jane
seymour
and
the
king
seated
on
a
couch
within
the
apartment
henry
was
habited
like
a
pilgrim
but
he
had
thrown
down
his
hat
ornamented
with
the
his
vizard
and
his
staff
and
had
just
forced
his
fair
companion
to
unmask
at
the
sight
anne
was
transfixed
with
jealous
rage
and
was
for
the
moment
almost
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
norris
or
of
the
monk
who
remained
behind
the
curtain
pointing
to
what
was
taking
place
your
majesty
is
determined
to
expose
my
blushes
said
jane
seymour
slightly
struggling
with
her
royal
lover
nay
i
only
want
to
be
satisfied
that
it
is
really
yourself
sweetheart
cried
henry
passionately
it
was
in
mercy
to
me
i
suppose
that
you
insisted
upon
shrouding
those
beauteous
features
from
my
view
hear
you
that
madam
whispered
norris
to
anne
the
queen
answered
by
a
convulsive
clasp
of
the
hand
your
majesty
but
jests
with
me
said
jane
seymour
jests
cried
henry
passionately
by
my
faith
i
never
understood
the
power
of
beauty
till
now
no
charms
ever
moved
my
heart
like
yours
nor
shall
i
know
a
moment
peace
till
you
become
i
am
grieved
to
hear
it
my
liege
replied
jane
seymour
for
i
never
can
be
yours
unless
as
your
again
norris
hazarded
a
whisper
to
anne
boleyn
which
was
answered
by
another
nervous
grasp
of
the
hand
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
pursued
jane
seeing
the
gloomy
reverie
into
which
her
royal
lover
was
thrown
i
can
give
your
majesty
no
hopes
at
you
have
been
schooled
by
anne
boleyn
sweetheart
said
henry
how
so
my
liege
demanded
jane
seymour
those
are
the
very
words
she
used
to
me
when
i
wooed
her
and
which
induced
me
to
divorce
catherine
of
arragon
replied
henry
now
they
may
bring
about
her
own
just
heaven
murmured
anne
i
dare
not
listen
to
your
majesty
said
jane
seymour
in
a
tremulous
tone
and
yet
if
i
dared
speak
speak
on
fearlessly
sweetheart
said
henry
then
i
am
well
assured
said
jane
that
the
queen
no
longer
loves
you
nay
that
she
loves
it
is
false
minion
cried
anne
boleyn
rushing
forward
while
norris
hastily
retreated
it
is
false
it
is
you
who
would
deceive
the
king
for
your
own
purposes
but
i
have
fortunately
been
brought
hither
to
prevent
the
injury
you
would
do
me
oh
henry
have
i
deserved
this
of
you
you
have
chanced
to
overhear
part
of
a
scene
in
a
masquerade
madam
that
is
all
said
the
king
i
have
chanced
to
arrive
most
opportunely
for
myself
said
anne
as
for
this
slanderous
and
deceitful
minion
i
shall
dismiss
her
from
my
service
if
your
majesty
is
determined
to
prove
faithless
to
me
it
shall
not
be
with
one
of
my
own
catherine
of
arragon
should
have
made
that
speech
retorted
jane
seymour
bitterly
she
had
reason
to
complain
that
she
was
supplanted
by
one
much
beneath
her
and
she
never
played
the
king
nor
have
i
cried
anne
fiercely
if
i
had
my
will
i
should
strike
thee
dead
for
the
insinuation
henry
my
lord
my
love
if
you
have
any
regard
for
me
instantly
dismiss
jane
it
may
not
be
madam
replied
henry
in
a
freezing
tone
she
has
done
nothing
to
deserve
dismissal
if
any
one
is
to
blame
in
the
matter
it
is
and
will
you
allow
her
to
make
these
accusations
against
me
without
punishment
cried
anne
peace
madam
cried
the
king
sternly
and
thank
my
that
i
go
no
further
into
the
matter
if
you
are
weary
of
the
masque
i
pray
you
retire
to
your
own
apartments
for
myself
i
shall
lead
jane
seymour
to
the
and
if
your
majesty
should
need
a
partner
said
jane
walking
up
to
anne
and
speaking
in
a
low
tone
you
will
doubtless
find
sir
henry
norris
the
queen
looked
as
if
stricken
by
a
thunderbolt
she
heard
the
triumphant
laugh
of
her
rival
she
saw
her
led
forth
all
smiles
and
beauty
and
triumph
by
the
king
to
the
dance
and
she
covered
her
face
in
agony
while
she
was
in
this
state
a
deep
voice
breathed
in
her
ears
the
vengeance
of
catherine
of
arragon
begins
to
work
looking
up
she
beheld
the
tall
figure
of
the
monk
retreating
from
the
chamber
iii
what
passed
between
norris
and
the
tall
monk
tottering
to
the
seat
which
henry
and
jane
had
just
quitted
anne
sank
into
it
after
a
little
time
having
in
some
degree
recovered
her
composure
she
was
about
to
return
to
the
great
hall
when
norris
appeared
i
did
not
deceive
you
madam
he
said
when
i
told
you
the
king
was
insensible
to
your
charms
he
only
lives
for
jane
would
i
could
dismiss
her
cried
anne
furiously
if
you
were
to
do
so
she
would
soon
be
replaced
by
another
rejoined
norris
the
king
delights
only
in
change
with
him
the
last
face
is
ever
the
most
you
speak
fearful
treason
sir
replied
anne
but
i
believe
it
to
be
the
oh
then
madam
pursued
norris
since
the
king
is
so
regardless
of
you
why
trouble
yourself
about
him
there
are
those
who
would
sacrifice
a
thousand
lives
if
they
possessed
them
for
your
i
fear
it
is
the
same
with
all
men
rejoined
anne
a
woman
heart
is
a
bauble
which
when
obtained
is
speedily
tossed
your
majesty
judges
our
sex
too
harshly
said
norris
if
i
had
the
same
fortune
as
the
king
i
should
never
the
king
himself
once
thought
so
once
swore
so
replied
anne
petulantly
it
is
the
common
parlance
of
lovers
but
i
may
not
listen
to
such
discourse
oh
madam
cried
norris
you
misjudge
me
greatly
my
heart
is
not
made
of
the
same
stuff
as
that
of
the
royal
henry
i
can
love
deeply
devotedly
know
you
not
that
by
these
rash
speeches
you
place
your
head
in
jeopardy
said
anne
i
would
rather
lose
it
than
not
be
permitted
to
love
you
he
replied
but
your
rashness
endangers
me
said
the
queen
your
passion
has
already
been
noticed
by
jane
seymour
and
the
slightest
further
indiscretion
will
be
nay
if
that
be
so
cried
norris
and
your
majesty
should
be
placed
in
peril
on
my
account
i
will
banish
myself
from
the
court
and
from
your
presence
whatever
the
effort
cost
no
replied
anne
i
will
not
tax
you
so
hardly
i
do
not
think
she
added
tenderly
deserted
as
i
am
by
the
king
that
i
could
spare
you
confess
then
that
i
have
inspired
you
with
some
regard
he
cried
rapturously
do
not
indulge
in
these
transports
norris
said
anne
mournfully
your
passion
will
only
lead
to
your
destruction
perchance
to
mine
let
the
certainty
that
i
do
love
content
you
and
seek
not
to
tempt
your
fate
oh
madam
you
make
me
the
happiest
of
men
by
the
avowal
he
cried
i
envy
not
now
the
king
for
i
feel
raised
above
him
by
your
you
must
join
the
revel
norris
said
anne
your
absence
from
it
will
be
and
extending
her
hand
to
him
he
knelt
down
and
pressed
it
passionately
to
his
lips
ah
we
are
observed
she
cried
suddenly
and
almost
with
a
shriek
rise
sir
norris
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
and
to
his
inexpressible
dismay
saw
the
figure
of
a
tall
monk
gliding
away
throwing
a
meaning
look
at
the
almost
sinking
queen
he
followed
the
mysterious
observer
into
the
great
hall
determined
to
rid
himself
of
him
in
some
way
before
he
should
have
time
to
make
any
revelations
avoiding
the
brilliant
throng
the
monk
entered
the
adjoining
corridor
and
descending
the
great
staircase
passed
into
the
upper
quadrangle
from
thence
he
proceeded
towards
the
cloisters
near
george
chapel
where
he
was
overtaken
by
norris
who
had
followed
him
closely
what
would
you
with
me
sir
henry
norris
cried
the
monk
halting
you
may
guess
said
norris
sternly
and
drawing
his
sword
there
are
secrets
which
are
dangerous
to
the
possessor
unless
you
swear
never
to
betray
what
you
have
seen
and
heard
you
the
tall
monk
laughed
derisively
you
know
that
your
life
is
in
my
power
he
said
and
therefore
you
threaten
mine
well
take
it
if
you
as
he
spoke
he
drew
a
sword
from
beneath
his
robe
and
stood
upon
his
defence
after
a
few
passes
norris
weapon
was
beaten
from
his
grasp
you
are
now
completely
at
my
mercy
said
the
monk
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
call
the
guard
and
declare
all
i
have
heard
to
the
i
would
rather
you
plunged
your
sword
into
my
heart
said
norris
there
is
one
way
and
only
one
by
which
my
secrecy
may
be
purchased
said
the
monk
name
it
replied
norris
were
it
to
be
purchased
by
my
perdition
i
would
embrace
you
have
hit
the
point
exactly
rejoined
the
monk
drily
can
you
not
guess
with
whom
you
have
to
deal
partly
replied
norris
i
never
found
such
force
in
mortal
arm
as
you
have
probably
not
laughed
the
other
most
of
those
who
have
ventured
against
me
have
found
their
match
but
come
with
me
into
the
park
and
you
shall
learn
the
condition
of
my
i
can
not
quit
the
castle
replied
norris
but
i
will
take
you
to
my
lodgings
where
we
shall
be
wholly
and
crossing
the
lower
ward
they
proceeded
to
the
tower
on
the
south
side
of
it
now
appropriated
to
the
governor
of
the
alms
knights
about
an
hour
after
this
norris
returned
to
the
revel
his
whole
demeanour
was
altered
and
his
looks
ghastly
he
sought
the
queen
who
had
returned
to
the
seat
in
the
embrasure
what
has
happened
said
anne
in
a
low
tone
as
he
approached
her
have
you
killed
him
no
he
replied
but
i
have
purchased
our
safety
at
a
terrible
you
alarm
me
norris
what
mean
you
she
cried
i
mean
this
he
answered
regarding
her
with
passionate
earnestness
that
you
must
love
me
now
for
i
have
perilled
my
salvation
for
you
that
tall
monk
was
herne
the
iv
of
the
secret
interview
between
norris
and
anne
boleyn
and
of
the
dissimulation
practised
by
the
king
henry
attentions
to
jane
seymour
at
the
masqued
fete
were
so
marked
that
the
whole
court
was
made
aware
of
his
passion
but
it
was
not
anticipated
that
any
serious
and
extraordinary
consequences
would
result
from
the
intoxication
far
less
that
the
queen
herself
would
be
removed
to
make
way
for
her
successful
rival
it
was
afterwards
however
remembered
that
at
this
time
henry
held
frequent
long
and
grave
conferences
with
the
dukes
of
suffolk
and
norfolk
and
appeared
to
be
engrossed
in
the
meditation
of
some
project
after
the
scene
at
the
revel
anne
did
not
make
another
exhibition
of
jealousy
but
it
was
not
that
she
was
reconciled
to
her
situation
or
in
any
way
free
from
uneasiness
on
the
contrary
the
unhappy
catherine
of
arragon
did
not
suffer
more
in
secret
but
she
knew
from
experience
that
with
her
royal
consort
all
reproaches
would
be
unavailing
one
morning
when
she
was
alone
within
her
chamber
her
father
who
was
now
earl
of
wiltshire
obtained
admittance
to
her
you
have
a
troubled
look
my
dear
lord
she
said
as
she
motioned
him
to
a
seat
and
with
good
reason
he
replied
oh
anne
words
can
not
express
my
anxiety
at
the
present
state
of
it
will
speedily
pass
by
my
lord
she
replied
the
king
will
soon
be
tired
of
his
new
not
before
he
has
overthrown
the
old
one
i
fear
rejoined
the
earl
jane
seymour
charms
have
usurped
entire
sovereignty
over
him
with
all
her
air
of
ingenuousness
and
simplicity
the
minion
is
artful
and
dangerous
she
has
a
high
mark
i
am
persuaded
no
less
than
the
but
henry
can
not
wed
her
he
can
not
divorce
me
said
anne
so
thought
catherine
of
arragon
replied
her
father
and
yet
she
was
divorced
anne
i
am
convinced
a
plot
is
hatching
against
you
do
not
fear
for
my
life
father
she
cried
trembling
i
trust
there
are
no
grounds
for
charges
against
you
by
which
it
might
be
brought
in
jeopardy
replied
the
earl
gravely
none
father
none
she
exclaimed
i
am
glad
of
it
rejoined
the
earl
for
i
have
heard
that
the
king
said
to
one
who
suggested
another
divorce
to
him
if
the
queen
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
divorce
she
also
comes
within
the
pale
of
the
scaffold
a
pledge
was
extorted
from
him
to
that
effect
said
anne
in
a
hollow
voice
that
an
attempt
will
be
made
against
you
i
firmly
believe
replied
the
earl
but
if
you
are
wholly
innocent
you
have
nothing
to
oh
father
i
know
not
that
cried
anne
innocence
avails
little
with
the
it
will
prove
your
best
safeguard
said
the
earl
and
now
farewell
daughter
heaven
guard
you
keep
the
strictest
watch
upon
so
saying
he
quitted
the
apartment
and
as
soon
as
she
was
left
alone
the
unhappy
anne
burst
into
an
agony
of
tears
from
this
state
of
affliction
she
was
roused
by
hearing
her
own
name
pronounced
in
low
accents
and
looking
up
she
beheld
sir
henry
norris
oh
norris
she
said
in
a
tone
of
reproach
you
have
come
hither
to
destroy
no
one
knows
of
my
coming
he
said
at
least
no
one
who
will
betray
me
i
was
brought
hither
by
one
who
will
take
care
we
are
not
by
herne
demanded
anne
norris
answered
in
the
affirmative
would
you
had
never
leagued
yourself
with
him
she
cried
i
fear
the
rash
act
will
bring
destruction
upon
us
it
is
too
late
to
retract
now
he
replied
besides
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
sacrificed
myself
to
preserve
but
will
the
sacrifice
preserve
me
she
cried
i
fear
not
i
have
just
been
told
that
the
king
is
preparing
some
terrible
measure
against
me
that
he
meditates
removing
me
to
make
way
for
jane
you
have
heard
the
truth
madam
replied
norris
he
will
try
to
bring
you
to
the
and
with
him
to
try
is
to
achieve
said
anne
oh
norris
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
contemplate
such
a
death
but
why
contemplate
it
madam
said
norris
why
if
you
are
satisfied
that
the
king
has
such
designs
against
you
why
if
you
feel
that
he
will
succeed
tarry
for
the
fatal
blow
fly
with
me
fly
with
one
who
loves
you
and
will
devote
his
whole
life
to
you
who
regards
you
not
as
the
queen
but
as
anne
boleyn
relinquish
this
false
and
hollow
grandeur
and
fly
with
me
to
happiness
and
and
relinquish
my
throne
to
jane
seymour
rejoined
anne
never
i
feel
that
all
you
assert
is
true
that
my
present
position
is
hazardous
that
jane
seymour
is
in
the
ascendant
while
i
am
on
the
decline
if
not
wholly
sunk
that
you
love
me
entirely
and
would
devote
your
life
to
me
still
with
all
these
motives
for
dread
i
can
not
prevail
upon
myself
voluntarily
to
give
up
my
title
and
to
abandon
my
post
to
a
you
do
not
love
me
then
as
i
love
you
anne
said
norris
if
i
were
a
king
i
would
abandon
my
throne
for
you
think
so
now
norris
because
you
are
not
king
she
replied
but
i
am
queen
and
will
remain
so
till
i
am
forced
to
abandon
my
i
understand
madam
rejoined
norris
gloomily
but
oh
i
bethink
you
to
what
risks
you
expose
yourself
you
know
the
king
terrible
determination
his
vindictiveness
his
full
well
she
replied
full
well
but
i
will
rather
die
a
queen
than
live
disgrace
and
ruined
in
wedding
henry
the
eighth
i
laid
my
account
to
certain
risks
and
those
i
must
before
norris
could
urge
anything
further
the
door
was
suddenly
opened
and
a
tall
dark
figure
entered
the
chamber
and
said
hastily
the
king
is
at
one
word
more
and
it
is
my
last
said
norris
to
anne
will
you
fly
with
me
all
shall
be
i
can
not
replied
anne
away
cried
herne
dragging
norris
forcibly
behind
the
tapestry
scarcely
had
they
disappeared
when
henry
entered
the
chamber
he
was
in
a
gayer
mood
than
had
been
usual
with
him
of
late
i
am
come
to
tell
you
madam
he
said
that
i
am
about
to
hold
jousts
in
the
castle
on
the
first
of
may
at
which
your
good
brother
and
mine
the
lord
rochford
will
be
the
challenger
while
i
myself
shall
be
the
defendant
you
will
adjudge
the
why
not
make
jane
seymour
queen
of
the
jousts
said
anne
unable
to
resist
the
remark
she
will
be
present
at
them
said
henry
but
i
have
my
own
reasons
he
added
significantly
for
not
wishing
her
to
appear
as
queen
on
this
whatever
may
be
your
reasons
the
wish
is
sufficient
for
me
said
anne
nay
will
you
tarry
a
moment
with
me
it
is
long
since
we
have
had
any
converse
in
private
i
am
busy
at
this
moment
replied
henry
bluffly
but
what
is
it
you
would
say
to
me
i
would
only
reproach
you
for
some
lack
of
tenderness
and
much
neglect
said
anne
oh
henry
do
you
remember
how
you
swore
by
your
life
your
crown
your
faith
all
that
you
held
sacred
or
dear
that
you
would
love
me
ever
and
so
i
would
if
i
could
replied
the
king
but
unfortunately
the
heart
is
not
entirely
under
control
have
you
yourself
for
instance
experienced
no
change
in
your
affections
no
replied
anne
i
have
certainly
suffered
severely
from
your
too
evident
regard
for
jane
seymour
but
though
deeply
mortified
and
distressed
i
have
never
for
a
moment
been
shaken
in
my
love
for
your
a
loyal
and
loving
reply
said
henry
i
thought
i
had
perceived
some
slight
diminution
in
your
you
did
yourself
grievous
injustice
by
the
supposition
replied
anne
i
would
fain
believe
so
said
the
king
but
there
are
some
persons
who
would
persuade
me
that
you
have
not
only
lost
your
affection
for
me
but
have
even
cast
eyes
of
regard
on
those
who
told
you
so
lied
cried
anne
passionately
never
woman
was
freer
from
such
imputation
than
never
woman
was
more
consummate
hypocrite
muttered
henry
you
do
not
credit
me
i
see
cried
anne
if
i
did
not
i
should
know
how
to
act
replied
the
king
you
remember
my
pledge
full
well
replied
anne
and
if
love
and
duty
would
not
restrain
me
fear
so
i
felt
rejoined
the
king
but
there
are
some
of
your
sex
upon
whom
nothing
will
operate
as
a
warning
so
faithless
and
inconstant
are
they
by
nature
it
has
been
hinted
to
me
that
you
are
one
of
these
but
i
can
not
think
it
i
can
never
believe
that
a
woman
for
whom
i
have
placed
my
very
throne
in
jeopardy
for
whom
i
have
divorced
my
family
i
have
elevated
and
ennobled
and
whom
i
have
placed
upon
the
throne
would
play
me
false
it
is
it
is
it
is
replied
anne
and
now
farewell
said
henry
i
have
stayed
longer
than
i
intended
and
i
should
not
have
mentioned
these
accusations
which
i
regard
as
wholly
groundless
unless
you
had
reproached
and
he
quitted
the
chamber
leaving
anne
in
a
strange
state
of
perplexity
and
terror
what
happened
at
the
jousts
the
first
of
may
arrived
and
though
destined
to
set
in
darkness
and
despair
it
arose
in
sunshine
and
smiles
all
were
astir
at
an
early
hour
within
the
castle
and
preparations
were
made
for
the
approaching
show
lists
were
erected
in
the
upper
quadrangle
and
the
whole
of
the
vast
area
was
strewn
with
sand
in
front
of
the
royal
lodgings
was
raised
a
gallery
the
centre
of
which
being
set
apart
for
the
queen
and
her
dames
was
covered
with
cloth
of
gold
and
crimson
velvet
on
which
the
royal
arms
were
gorgeously
emblazoned
the
two
wings
were
likewise
richly
decorated
and
adorned
with
scutcheons
and
pennons
while
from
the
battlements
of
the
eastern
side
of
the
court
were
hung
a
couple
of
long
flags
as
soon
as
these
preparations
were
completed
a
throng
of
pages
esquires
armourers
archers
and
henchmen
entered
it
from
the
norman
gateway
and
took
up
positions
within
the
barriers
the
space
without
the
pales
being
kept
by
a
double
line
of
halberdiers
next
came
the
trumpeters
mounted
on
richly
caparisoned
horses
and
having
their
clarions
decorated
with
silken
bandrols
fringed
with
gold
stationing
themselves
at
the
principal
entrance
of
the
lists
they
were
speedily
joined
by
the
heralds
pursuivants
and
other
officers
of
the
presently
afterwards
the
duke
of
suffolk
who
was
appointed
judge
of
the
lists
appeared
and
rode
round
the
arena
to
see
that
all
was
in
order
apparently
well
satisfied
with
the
survey
he
dismounted
and
proceeded
to
the
gallery
meanwhile
the
crowd
within
the
court
was
increased
by
a
great
influx
of
the
different
members
of
the
household
amongst
whom
were
shoreditch
paddington
and
hector
cutbeard
marry
this
promises
to
be
a
splendid
sight
said
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
the
king
will
no
doubt
do
his
devoir
gallantly
for
the
sake
of
the
bright
eyes
that
will
look
upon
you
mean
the
queen
of
course
said
shoreditch
i
mean
hers
who
may
be
queen
replied
cutbeard
mistress
jane
may
be
queen
exclaimed
shoreditch
you
surely
do
not
think
the
king
will
divorce
his
present
consort
stranger
things
have
happened
replied
cutbeard
significantly
if
i
am
not
greatly
out
of
my
reckoning
he
added
these
are
the
last
jousts
queen
anne
will
the
saints
forefend
cried
shoreditch
what
reason
have
you
for
thinking
so
that
i
may
not
declare
replied
cutbeard
but
before
the
jousts
are
over
you
will
see
whether
i
have
been
rightly
informed
or
hush
exclaimed
shoreditch
there
is
a
tall
monk
eyeing
us
strangely
and
i
am
not
certain
that
he
has
not
overheard
what
you
have
he
is
welcome
to
the
intelligence
replied
cutbeard
the
end
will
prove
its
though
this
was
uttered
in
a
confident
tone
he
nevertheless
glanced
with
some
misgiving
at
the
monk
who
stood
behind
paddington
the
object
of
the
investigation
was
a
very
tall
man
with
a
cowl
drawn
over
his
brow
he
had
a
ragged
black
beard
fierce
dark
eyes
and
a
complexion
like
bronze
seeing
cutboard
glance
anxiously
fixed
upon
him
he
advanced
towards
him
and
said
in
a
low
tone
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
but
talk
not
so
loud
if
you
value
your
so
saying
he
proceeded
to
another
part
of
the
lists
who
is
that
tall
monk
asked
paddington
devil
knows
answered
cutbeard
i
never
saw
him
before
but
he
has
a
villainous
soon
afterwards
a
flourish
of
trumpets
was
heard
and
amid
their
joyous
bruit
the
queen
sumptuously
arrayed
in
cloth
of
gold
and
ermine
and
having
a
small
crown
upon
her
brow
entered
the
gallery
and
took
her
seat
within
it
never
had
she
looked
more
beautiful
than
on
this
fatal
morning
and
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
beholders
she
completely
eclipsed
her
rival
jane
seymour
the
latter
who
stood
on
her
right
hard
and
was
exquisitely
attired
had
a
thoughtful
and
anxious
air
as
if
some
grave
matter
weighed
upon
her
while
the
queen
attendants
were
taking
their
places
lord
rochford
accompanied
by
sir
henry
norris
and
the
earls
of
surrey
and
essex
entered
the
lists
the
four
knights
were
completely
armed
and
mounted
on
powerful
steeds
barded
with
rich
cloth
of
gold
embroidered
with
silver
letters
each
had
a
great
crimson
plume
in
his
helmet
they
rode
singly
round
the
arena
and
bowed
as
they
passed
the
royal
gallery
norris
bending
almost
to
his
while
performing
his
salutation
to
the
queen
the
field
being
thus
taken
by
the
challengers
who
retired
to
the
upper
end
of
the
court
a
trumpet
was
thrice
sounded
by
a
herald
and
an
answer
was
immediately
made
by
another
herald
stationed
opposite
henry
the
seventh
buildings
when
the
clamour
ceased
the
king
fully
armed
and
followed
by
the
marquis
of
dorset
sir
thomas
wyat
and
the
lord
clifford
rode
into
the
lists
henry
was
equipped
in
a
superb
suit
of
armour
inlaid
with
gold
and
having
a
breastplate
of
the
globose
form
then
in
vogue
his
helmet
was
decorated
with
a
large
plume
the
trappings
of
his
steed
were
of
crimson
velvet
embroidered
with
the
royal
arms
and
edged
with
great
letters
of
massive
gold
bullion
full
of
pearls
and
precious
stones
he
was
attended
by
a
hundred
gentlemen
armourers
and
other
officers
arrayed
in
white
velvet
having
ridden
round
the
court
like
the
others
and
addressed
his
salutation
exclusively
to
jane
seymour
henry
took
his
station
with
his
companions
near
the
base
of
the
round
tower
the
summit
of
which
was
covered
with
spectators
as
were
the
towers
and
battlements
around
a
trumpet
was
now
sounded
and
the
king
and
the
lord
rochford
having
each
taken
a
lance
from
his
esquire
awaited
the
signal
to
start
from
the
duke
of
suffolk
who
was
seated
in
the
left
wing
of
the
royal
gallery
it
was
not
long
delayed
as
the
clarion
sounded
clearly
and
loudly
for
the
third
time
he
called
out
that
the
champions
might
go
no
sooner
were
the
words
uttered
than
the
thundering
tramp
of
the
steeds
resounded
and
the
opponents
met
midway
both
their
lances
were
shivered
but
as
the
king
did
not
in
the
slightest
degree
change
his
position
he
was
held
to
have
the
best
of
it
courses
were
then
run
by
the
others
with
varied
success
the
marquis
of
dorset
being
unhorsed
by
sir
henry
norris
whose
prowess
was
rewarded
by
the
plaudits
of
the
assemblage
and
what
was
infinitely
more
dear
to
him
by
the
smiles
of
the
queen
you
have
ridden
well
norris
cried
henry
advancing
towards
him
place
yourself
opposite
me
and
let
us
splinter
a
lance
as
norris
reined
back
his
steed
in
compliance
with
the
injunction
the
tall
monk
stepped
from
out
the
line
and
drawing
near
him
said
if
you
wish
to
prove
victorious
aim
at
the
upper
part
of
the
king
and
with
these
words
he
withdrew
by
the
time
norris
had
placed
his
lance
in
the
rest
the
trumpet
sounded
the
next
moment
the
word
was
given
and
the
champions
started
henry
rode
with
great
impetuosity
and
struck
norris
in
the
gorget
with
such
good
will
that
both
he
and
his
steed
were
shaken
but
norris
was
more
fortunate
following
the
advice
of
the
monk
he
made
the
upper
part
of
the
king
helmet
his
mark
and
the
blow
was
so
well
dealt
that
though
he
did
not
dislodge
the
royal
horseman
it
drove
back
his
steed
on
its
haunches
the
success
was
so
unequivocal
that
norris
was
at
once
declared
the
victor
by
the
judge
no
applause
however
followed
the
decision
from
a
fear
of
giving
offence
to
the
king
norris
dismounted
and
committing
his
steed
to
the
care
of
an
esquire
and
his
lance
to
a
page
took
off
his
helmet
and
advanced
towards
the
royal
gallery
near
which
the
earl
of
surrey
and
sir
thomas
wyat
were
standing
talking
with
the
other
dames
as
norris
drew
near
anne
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
gallery
and
smiled
at
him
tenderly
and
whether
by
design
or
accident
let
fall
her
embroidered
handkerchief
norris
stooped
to
pick
it
up
regarding
her
as
he
did
so
with
a
glance
of
the
most
passionate
devotion
a
terrible
gaze
however
was
fixed
on
the
unfortunate
pair
at
that
moment
it
was
that
of
the
king
while
henry
was
careering
in
front
of
the
gallery
to
display
himself
before
jane
seymour
a
tall
monk
approached
him
and
said
look
at
sir
henry
norris
thus
addressed
henry
raised
his
beaver
that
he
might
see
more
distinctly
and
beheld
norris
take
up
the
embroidered
handkerchief
which
he
recognised
as
one
that
he
had
given
in
the
early
days
of
his
affection
to
the
queen
the
sight
stung
him
almost
to
madness
and
he
had
great
difficulty
in
repressing
his
choler
but
if
this
slight
action
heightened
to
importance
as
it
was
by
the
looks
of
the
parties
roused
his
ire
it
was
nothing
to
what
followed
instead
of
restoring
it
to
the
queen
norris
unconscious
of
the
danger
in
which
he
stood
pressed
the
handkerchief
fervently
to
his
lips
i
am
hitherto
the
victor
of
the
jousts
he
said
may
i
keep
this
as
the
prize
anne
smiled
assent
it
is
the
proudest
i
ever
obtained
pursued
norris
and
he
placed
it
within
his
helmet
does
your
majesty
see
that
cried
the
tall
monk
who
still
remained
standing
near
the
king
death
of
my
life
exclaimed
henry
it
is
the
very
handkerchief
i
gave
her
before
our
union
i
can
contain
myself
no
longer
and
must
perforce
precipitate
matters
what
ho
he
cried
riding
up
to
that
part
of
the
gallery
where
the
duke
of
suffolk
was
seated
let
the
jousts
be
stopped
wherefore
my
dear
liege
said
suffolk
the
earl
of
surrey
and
sir
thomas
wyat
are
about
to
run
a
let
them
he
stopped
i
say
roared
henry
in
a
tone
that
admitted
of
no
dispute
and
wheeling
round
his
charger
he
dashed
into
the
middle
of
the
barriers
shouting
in
loud
authoritative
accents
the
jousts
are
at
an
end
disperse
the
utmost
consternation
was
occasioned
by
the
announcement
the
duke
of
suffolk
instantly
quitted
his
seat
and
pressed
through
the
crowd
to
the
king
who
whispered
a
few
hasty
words
in
his
ear
henry
then
called
to
the
earl
of
surrey
the
marquis
of
dorset
the
lord
clifford
wyat
and
some
others
and
bidding
them
attend
him
prepared
to
quit
the
court
as
he
passed
the
royal
gallery
anne
called
to
him
in
an
agonised
voice
oh
henry
what
is
the
matter
what
have
i
done
but
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
her
he
dashed
through
the
norman
gate
galloped
down
the
lower
quadrangle
and
quitted
the
castle
the
confusion
that
ensued
may
be
imagined
all
saw
that
something
extraordinary
and
terrible
had
taken
place
though
few
knew
precisely
what
it
was
dismay
sat
in
every
countenance
and
the
general
anxiety
was
heightened
by
the
agitation
of
the
queen
who
uttering
a
piercing
scream
fell
back
and
was
borne
off
in
a
state
of
insensibility
by
her
attendants
unable
to
control
himself
at
the
sight
norris
burst
through
the
guard
and
rushing
up
the
great
staircase
soon
gained
the
apartment
to
which
the
queen
had
been
conveyed
owing
to
the
timely
aid
afforded
her
she
was
speedily
restored
and
the
first
person
her
eyes
fell
upon
was
her
lover
at
the
sight
of
him
a
glance
of
affection
illumined
her
features
but
it
was
instantly
changed
into
an
expression
of
alarm
at
this
juncture
the
duke
of
suffolk
who
with
bouchier
and
a
party
of
halberdiers
had
entered
the
room
stepped
up
to
the
queen
and
will
it
please
you
madam
to
retire
to
an
inner
apartment
i
grieve
to
say
you
are
under
arrest
exclaimed
anne
for
what
crime
your
grace
you
are
charged
with
incontinency
towards
the
king
highness
replied
suffolk
sternly
but
i
am
innocent
cried
anne
as
heaven
shall
judge
me
i
am
innocent
i
trust
you
will
be
able
to
prove
yourself
so
madam
said
suffolk
sir
henry
norris
your
person
is
likewise
then
i
am
lost
indeed
exclaimed
anne
distractedly
do
not
let
these
false
and
malignant
accusations
alarm
you
madam
said
norri
you
have
nothing
to
fear
i
will
die
protesting
your
sir
henry
norris
said
the
duke
coldly
your
own
imprudence
has
brought
about
this
sad
i
feel
it
replied
norris
and
i
deserve
the
worst
punishment
that
can
be
inflicted
upon
me
for
it
but
i
declare
to
you
as
i
will
declare
upon
the
rack
if
i
am
placed
upon
it
that
the
queen
is
wholly
innocent
let
her
not
suffer
for
my
you
hear
what
sir
henry
says
cried
anne
and
i
call
upon
you
to
recollect
the
testimony
he
has
i
shall
not
fail
to
do
so
madam
replied
suffolk
your
majesty
will
have
strict
justice
echoed
anne
with
a
laugh
of
bitter
incredulity
justice
from
henry
the
eighth
beseech
you
madam
do
not
destroy
yourself
said
norris
prostrating
himself
before
her
recollect
by
whom
you
are
surrounded
my
folly
and
madness
have
brought
you
into
this
strait
and
i
sincerely
implore
your
pardon
for
you
are
not
to
blame
norris
said
anne
it
is
fate
not
you
that
has
destroyed
me
the
hand
that
has
dealt
this
blow
is
that
of
a
queen
within
the
captain
bouchier
said
the
duke
of
suffolk
addressing
that
officer
who
stood
near
him
you
will
convey
sir
henry
norris
to
the
in
the
lower
gateway
whence
he
will
be
removed
to
the
farewell
for
ever
norris
cried
anne
we
shall
meet
no
more
on
earth
in
what
has
fallen
on
me
i
recognise
the
hand
of
retribution
but
the
same
measure
which
has
been
meted
to
me
shall
be
dealt
to
others
i
denounce
jane
seymour
before
heaven
she
shall
not
long
retain
the
crown
she
is
about
to
snatch
from
me
that
imprecation
had
better
have
been
spared
madam
said
the
duke
be
advised
my
gracious
mistress
cried
norris
and
do
not
let
your
grief
and
distraction
place
you
in
the
power
of
your
enemies
all
may
yet
go
i
denounce
her
persisted
anne
wholly
disregarding
the
caution
and
i
also
denounce
the
king
no
union
of
his
shall
be
happy
and
other
blood
than
mine
shall
at
a
sign
from
the
duke
she
was
here
borne
half
suffocated
with
emotion
to
an
inner
apartment
while
norris
was
conveyed
by
bouchier
and
a
company
of
halberdiers
to
the
lower
gateway
and
placed
within
the
prison
chamber
vi
what
passed
between
anne
boleyn
and
the
duke
of
suffolk
and
how
herne
the
hunter
appeared
to
her
in
the
oratory
for
some
hours
anne
boleyn
attendants
were
alarmed
for
her
reason
and
there
seemed
good
grounds
for
the
apprehension
so
wildly
and
incoherently
did
she
talk
and
so
violently
comport
herself
she
who
was
usually
so
gentle
now
weeping
as
if
her
soul
would
pass
away
in
tears
now
breaking
into
fearful
hysterical
laughter
it
was
a
piteous
sight
and
deeply
moved
all
who
witnessed
it
but
towards
evening
she
became
calmer
and
desired
to
be
left
by
herself
her
wish
being
complied
with
she
fell
upon
her
knees
and
besought
forgiveness
for
her
manifold
offences
may
my
earthly
sufferings
she
cried
avail
me
here
after
and
may
my
blood
wash
out
my
guilt
i
feel
the
enormity
of
my
offence
and
acknowledge
the
justice
of
my
punishment
pardon
me
o
injured
catherine
pardon
me
i
implore
thee
thou
seest
in
me
the
most
abject
pitiable
woman
in
the
whole
realm
overthrown
neglected
despised
about
to
die
a
shameful
death
what
worse
can
befall
me
thine
anguish
was
great
but
it
was
never
sharpened
by
remorse
like
mine
oh
that
i
could
live
my
life
over
again
i
would
resist
all
the
dazzling
temptations
i
have
yielded
to
above
all
i
would
not
injure
thee
oh
that
i
had
resisted
henry
love
his
false
vows
his
fatal
lures
but
it
is
useless
to
repine
i
have
acted
wrongfully
and
must
pay
the
penalty
of
my
crime
may
my
tears
my
penitence
my
blood
operate
as
an
atonement
and
procure
me
pardon
from
the
merciful
judge
before
whom
i
shall
shortly
in
such
prayers
and
lamentations
she
passed
more
than
an
hour
when
her
attendants
entered
to
inform
her
that
the
duke
of
suffolk
and
the
lords
audley
and
cromwell
were
without
and
desired
to
see
her
she
immediately
went
forth
to
them
we
are
come
to
acquaint
you
madam
said
suffolk
that
you
will
be
removed
at
an
early
hour
tomorrow
morning
to
the
tower
there
to
abide
during
the
king
if
the
king
will
have
it
so
my
lords
she
replied
i
must
needs
go
but
i
protest
my
innocence
and
will
protest
it
to
the
last
i
have
ever
been
a
faithful
and
loyal
consort
to
his
highness
and
though
i
may
not
have
demeaned
myself
to
him
so
humbly
and
gratefully
as
i
ought
to
have
done
seeing
how
much
i
owe
him
yet
i
have
lacked
nothing
in
affection
and
duty
i
have
had
jealous
fancies
and
suspicions
of
him
especially
of
late
and
have
troubled
him
with
them
but
i
pray
his
forgiveness
for
my
folly
which
proceeded
from
too
much
regard
and
if
i
am
acquitted
of
my
present
charge
i
will
offend
him
so
no
we
will
report
what
you
say
to
the
king
rejoined
suffolk
gravely
but
we
are
bound
to
add
that
his
highness
does
not
act
on
mere
suspicion
the
proofs
of
your
guilt
being
strong
against
there
can
be
no
such
proofs
cried
anne
quickly
who
are
my
accusers
and
what
do
they
state
you
are
charged
with
conspiring
against
the
king
life
and
dishonouring
his
bed
replied
suffolk
sternly
your
accusers
will
appear
in
due
they
are
base
creatures
suborned
for
the
purpose
cried
anne
no
loyal
person
would
so
forswear
time
will
show
you
who
they
are
madam
said
suffolk
but
having
now
answered
all
your
questions
i
pray
you
permit
us
to
shall
i
not
see
the
king
before
i
am
taken
to
the
tower
said
anne
upon
whom
the
terror
of
her
situation
rushed
with
new
force
his
highness
has
quitted
the
castle
replied
suffolk
and
there
is
no
likelihood
of
his
return
you
tell
me
so
to
deceive
me
cried
anne
let
me
see
him
let
me
throw
myself
at
his
feet
i
can
convince
him
of
my
innocence
and
move
him
to
compassion
let
me
see
him
i
implore
of
you
i
charge
you
i
swear
to
you
madam
that
the
king
has
departed
for
hampton
court
replied
suffolk
then
take
me
to
him
there
under
strong
guard
or
as
secretly
as
you
please
she
cried
passionately
i
will
return
with
you
instantly
if
i
am
were
i
to
comply
with
your
request
it
would
be
fruitless
madam
replied
suffolk
the
king
would
not
see
oh
suffolk
cried
anne
prostrating
herself
before
him
i
have
shown
you
many
kindnesses
in
my
season
of
power
and
have
always
stood
your
friend
with
the
king
do
me
this
favour
now
i
will
never
forget
it
introduce
me
to
the
king
i
am
sure
i
can
move
his
heart
if
i
can
only
see
it
would
cost
me
my
head
madam
said
the
duke
in
an
inexorable
tone
rise
i
pray
you
are
more
cruel
than
the
king
said
anne
obeying
and
now
my
lords
she
continued
with
more
composure
and
dignity
since
you
refuse
my
last
request
and
plainly
prove
to
me
the
sort
of
justice
i
may
expect
i
will
not
detain
you
longer
i
shall
be
ready
to
attend
you
to
the
tower
the
barge
will
proceed
an
hour
before
dawn
said
suffolk
must
i
then
go
by
water
asked
anne
such
are
the
king
commands
replied
suffolk
it
is
no
matter
she
rejoined
i
shall
be
ready
when
you
will
for
i
shall
not
retire
to
rest
during
the
upon
this
suffolk
and
the
others
slowly
withdrew
and
anne
again
retired
to
the
oratory
she
remained
alone
brooding
in
a
state
of
indescribable
anguish
upon
the
probable
fate
awaiting
her
when
all
at
once
raising
her
eyes
she
beheld
a
tall
dark
figure
near
the
arras
even
in
the
gloom
she
recognised
herne
the
hunter
and
with
difficulty
repressed
a
scream
be
silent
cried
herne
with
an
emphatic
gesture
i
am
come
to
deliver
anne
could
not
repress
a
joyful
cry
not
so
loud
rejoined
herne
or
you
will
alarm
your
attendants
i
will
set
you
free
on
certain
ah
conditions
exclaimed
anne
recoiling
if
they
are
such
as
will
affect
my
eternal
welfare
i
can
not
accept
you
will
repent
it
when
it
is
too
late
replied
herne
once
removed
to
the
tower
i
can
no
longer
aid
you
my
power
extends
only
to
the
forest
and
the
will
you
take
me
to
the
king
at
hampton
court
said
anne
it
would
be
useless
replied
herne
i
will
only
do
what
i
have
stated
if
you
fly
with
me
you
can
never
appear
again
as
anne
boleyn
sir
henry
norris
shall
be
set
free
at
the
same
time
and
you
shall
both
dwell
with
me
in
the
forest
come
i
can
not
go
said
anne
holding
back
it
were
to
fly
to
a
worse
danger
i
may
save
my
soul
now
but
if
i
embrace
your
offer
i
am
lost
for
herne
laughed
derisively
you
need
have
no
fear
on
that
score
he
said
i
will
not
trust
you
replied
anne
i
have
yielded
to
temptation
already
and
am
now
paying
the
penalty
of
you
are
clinging
to
the
crown
said
herne
because
you
know
that
by
this
step
you
will
irrecoverably
lose
it
and
you
fancy
that
some
change
may
yet
operate
to
your
advantage
with
the
king
it
is
a
vain
delusive
hope
if
you
leave
this
castle
for
the
tower
you
will
perish
ignominiously
on
the
what
will
be
must
be
replied
anne
i
will
not
save
myself
in
the
way
you
norris
will
say
and
with
reason
that
you
love
him
not
cried
herne
then
he
will
wrong
me
replied
anne
for
i
do
love
him
but
of
what
account
were
a
few
years
of
fevered
happiness
compared
with
endless
torture
i
will
befriend
you
in
spite
of
yourself
vociferated
herne
seizing
her
arm
you
shall
go
with
me
i
will
not
said
anne
falling
on
her
knees
oh
father
of
mercy
she
cried
energetically
deliver
me
from
this
fiend
take
your
fate
then
rejoined
herne
dashing
her
furiously
backwards
and
when
her
attendants
alarmed
by
the
sound
rushed
into
the
chamber
they
found
her
stretched
on
the
floor
in
a
state
of
insensibility
vii
how
herne
appeared
to
henry
in
the
home
park
on
that
same
night
at
a
late
hour
a
horseman
mounted
on
a
powerful
steed
entered
the
eastern
side
of
the
home
park
and
stationed
himself
beneath
the
trees
he
had
not
been
there
long
when
the
castle
clock
tolled
forth
the
hour
of
midnight
and
ere
the
deep
strokes
died
away
a
second
horseman
was
seen
galloping
across
the
moonlit
glade
towards
him
has
all
been
done
as
i
directed
suffolk
he
demanded
as
the
newcomer
approached
him
it
has
my
liege
replied
the
duke
the
queen
is
imprisoned
within
her
chamber
and
will
be
removed
at
early
dawn
to
the
you
had
better
start
in
an
hour
from
this
time
said
the
king
it
is
a
long
passage
by
water
and
i
am
anxious
to
avoid
all
chance
of
attempt
at
your
wishes
shall
be
obeyed
replied
the
duke
poor
soul
her
grief
was
most
agonizing
and
i
had
much
ado
to
maintain
my
composure
she
implored
in
the
most
passionate
manner
to
be
allowed
to
see
your
highness
before
her
removal
i
told
her
it
was
impossible
and
that
even
if
you
were
at
the
castle
you
would
not
listen
to
her
you
did
right
rejoined
henry
i
will
never
see
her
more
not
that
i
fear
being
moved
by
her
prayers
but
that
knowing
how
deceitful
and
faithless
she
is
i
loathe
to
look
upon
her
what
is
expressed
upon
the
matter
by
the
household
speak
frankly
then
replied
the
duke
your
highness
proceedings
are
regarded
as
harsh
and
unjustifiable
the
general
opinion
is
that
you
only
desire
to
remove
anne
to
make
way
for
mistress
jane
ha
they
talk
thus
do
they
cried
the
king
i
will
silence
their
saucy
prating
ere
long
tell
all
who
venture
to
speak
to
you
on
the
subject
that
i
have
long
suspected
the
queen
of
a
secret
liking
for
norris
but
that
i
determined
to
conceal
my
suspicions
till
i
found
i
had
good
warrant
for
them
that
occurred
as
you
know
some
weeks
ago
however
i
awaited
a
pretext
for
proceeding
against
them
and
it
was
furnished
by
their
own
imprudence
convinced
that
something
would
occur
i
had
made
my
preparations
nor
was
i
deceived
you
may
add
also
that
not
until
my
marriage
is
invalidated
anne
offspring
illegitimatised
and
herself
beheaded
shall
i
consider
the
foul
blot
upon
my
name
has
your
majesty
any
further
commands
said
suffolk
i
saw
norris
in
his
prison
before
i
rode
forth
to
let
him
be
taken
to
the
tower
under
a
strong
escort
at
once
said
henry
lord
rochford
i
suppose
has
already
been
removed
there
he
has
replied
the
duke
shall
i
attend
your
majesty
to
your
followers
it
is
needless
replied
the
king
they
are
waiting
for
me
close
at
hand
at
the
foot
of
datchet
bridge
fare
well
my
good
brother
look
well
to
your
prisoners
i
shall
feel
more
easy
when
anne
is
safely
lodged
within
the
so
saying
he
wheeled
round
and
striking
spurs
into
his
steed
dashed
through
the
trees
while
the
duke
rode
back
to
the
castle
henry
had
not
proceeded
far
when
a
horseman
mounted
on
a
sable
steed
emerged
from
the
thicket
and
galloped
up
to
him
the
wild
attire
and
antlered
helm
of
this
personage
proclaimed
the
forest
fiend
ah
thou
here
demon
cried
the
king
his
lion
nature
overmastered
by
superstitious
fear
for
a
moment
what
wouldst
thou
you
are
on
the
eve
of
committing
a
great
crime
replied
herne
and
i
told
you
that
at
such
times
i
would
always
appear
to
to
administer
justice
is
not
to
commit
crime
rejoined
the
king
anne
boleyn
deserves
her
think
not
to
impose
on
me
as
you
have
imposed
on
suffolk
cried
herne
with
a
derisive
laugh
i
know
your
motives
better
i
know
you
have
no
proof
of
her
guilt
and
that
in
your
heart
of
hearts
you
believe
her
innocent
but
you
destroy
her
because
you
would
wed
jane
seymour
we
shall
meet
again
ere
long
ho
ho
ho
and
giving
the
rein
to
his
steed
he
disappeared
among
the
trees
viii
the
signal
gun
anne
boleyn
arraignment
took
place
in
the
great
hall
of
the
white
tower
on
the
of
may
before
the
duke
of
norfolk
who
was
created
lord
high
steward
for
the
occasion
and
peers
the
duke
had
his
seat
under
a
canopy
of
state
and
beneath
him
sat
the
earl
of
surrey
as
deputy
notwithstanding
an
eloquent
and
impassioned
defence
anne
was
found
guilty
and
having
been
required
to
lay
aside
her
crown
and
the
other
insignia
of
royalty
was
condemned
to
be
burned
or
beheaded
at
the
king
pleasure
on
the
following
day
she
was
summoned
to
the
archiepiscopal
palace
at
lambeth
whither
she
was
privately
conveyed
and
her
marriage
with
the
king
was
declared
by
cranmer
to
be
null
and
void
and
to
have
always
been
so
death
by
the
axe
was
the
doom
awarded
to
her
by
the
king
and
the
day
appointed
for
the
execution
was
friday
the
of
may
at
the
hour
of
noon
leaving
the
conduct
of
the
fatal
ceremony
to
the
duke
of
suffolk
who
had
orders
to
have
a
signal
gun
fired
from
the
summit
of
the
white
tower
which
was
to
be
answered
from
various
points
when
all
was
over
henry
repaired
to
windsor
castle
on
the
evening
of
thursday
before
this
he
had
formally
offered
his
hand
to
jane
seymour
and
while
the
unfortunate
queen
was
languishing
within
the
tower
he
was
basking
in
the
smiles
of
his
new
mistress
and
counting
the
hours
till
he
could
make
her
his
own
on
the
tuesday
before
the
execution
jane
seymour
retired
to
her
father
mansion
wolff
hall
in
wiltshire
where
preparations
were
made
for
the
marriage
which
it
was
arranged
should
take
place
there
in
private
on
the
saturday
on
arriving
at
the
castle
henry
gave
out
that
he
should
hunt
on
the
following
morning
in
the
great
park
and
retired
to
his
closet
but
he
did
not
long
remain
there
and
putting
on
the
garb
of
a
yeoman
of
the
guard
descended
by
the
narrow
flight
of
steps
already
mentioned
as
occupying
the
same
situation
as
the
existing
hundred
steps
to
the
town
and
proceeded
to
the
garter
where
he
found
several
guests
assembled
discussing
the
affairs
of
the
day
and
bryan
bowntance
strong
ale
at
the
same
time
amongst
the
number
were
the
duke
of
shoreditch
paddington
hector
cutbeard
and
kit
coo
at
the
moment
of
the
entrance
they
were
talking
of
the
approaching
execution
oh
the
vanity
of
worldly
greatness
exclaimed
bryan
lifting
up
his
hands
only
seven
years
ago
last
saint
george
day
this
lovely
queen
first
entered
the
castle
with
the
king
amid
pomp
and
splendour
and
power
and
with
a
long
life
apparently
of
happiness
before
her
and
now
she
is
condemned
to
but
if
she
has
played
the
king
false
she
deserves
her
doom
replied
shoreditch
i
would
behead
my
own
wife
if
she
served
me
the
same
trick
that
is
if
i
you
do
right
to
say
you
could
rejoined
paddington
the
beheading
of
a
wife
is
a
royal
privilege
and
can
not
be
enjoyed
by
a
marry
i
wonder
how
the
king
could
prefer
mistress
jane
seymour
for
my
part
said
hector
cutbeard
to
my
thinking
she
is
not
to
be
compared
with
queen
she
has
a
lovely
blue
eye
and
a
figure
as
straight
as
an
arrow
returned
shoreditch
how
say
you
master
he
added
turning
to
the
king
what
think
you
of
mistress
jane
seymour
that
she
is
passably
fair
friend
replied
henry
but
how
as
compared
with
the
late
that
is
the
present
queen
for
poor
soul
she
has
yet
some
hours
to
live
rejoined
shoreditch
how
as
compared
with
her
why
i
think
jane
seymour
the
more
lovely
undoubtedly
replied
henry
but
i
may
be
not
in
the
least
friend
said
cutbeard
you
but
partake
of
your
royal
master
humour
jane
seymour
is
beautiful
no
doubt
and
so
was
anne
boleyn
marry
we
shall
see
many
fair
queens
on
the
throne
the
royal
henry
has
good
taste
and
good
management
he
sets
his
subjects
a
rare
example
and
shows
them
how
to
get
rid
of
troublesome
wives
we
shall
all
divorce
or
hang
our
spouses
when
we
get
tired
of
them
i
almost
wish
i
was
married
myself
that
i
might
try
the
ha
well
here
the
king
health
cried
shoreditch
and
wishing
him
as
many
wives
as
he
may
desire
what
say
you
friend
he
added
turning
to
henry
will
you
not
drink
that
toast
that
will
i
replied
henry
but
i
fancy
the
king
will
be
content
for
the
present
with
mistress
jane
for
the
present
no
doubt
said
hector
cutbeard
but
the
time
will
come
and
ere
long
when
jane
will
be
as
irksome
to
him
as
anne
is
ah
god
death
knave
darest
thou
say
so
cried
henry
furiously
why
i
have
said
nothing
treasonable
i
hope
rejoined
cutbeard
turning
pale
i
only
wish
the
king
to
be
happy
in
his
own
way
and
as
he
seems
to
delight
in
change
of
wives
i
pray
that
he
may
have
it
to
his
heart
a
fair
explanation
replied
henry
laughing
let
me
give
a
health
my
masters
cried
a
tall
archer
whom
no
one
had
hitherto
noticed
rising
in
one
corner
of
the
room
it
is
the
headsman
of
calais
and
may
he
do
his
work
featly
tomorrow
ha
ha
ha
a
good
toast
cried
hector
cutbeard
seize
him
who
has
proposed
it
cried
the
king
rising
it
is
herne
the
hunter
i
laugh
at
your
threats
here
as
elsewhere
harry
cried
herne
we
shall
meet
and
flinging
the
horn
cup
in
the
face
of
the
man
nearest
him
he
sprang
through
an
open
window
at
the
back
and
disappeared
both
cutbeard
and
shoreditch
were
much
alarmed
lest
the
freedom
of
their
expressions
should
be
taken
in
umbrage
by
the
king
but
he
calmed
their
fears
by
bestowing
a
good
humoured
buffet
on
the
cheek
of
the
latter
of
them
and
quitting
the
hostel
returned
to
the
castle
by
the
same
way
he
had
left
it
on
the
following
morning
about
ten
he
rode
into
the
great
park
attended
by
a
numerous
train
his
demeanour
was
moody
and
stern
and
a
general
gloom
pervaded
the
company
keeping
on
the
western
side
of
the
park
the
party
crossed
cranbourne
chase
but
though
they
encountered
several
fine
herds
of
deer
the
king
gave
no
orders
to
uncouple
the
hounds
at
last
they
arrived
at
that
part
of
the
park
where
sandpit
gate
is
now
situated
and
pursuing
a
path
bordered
by
noble
trees
a
fine
buck
was
suddenly
unharboured
upon
which
henry
gave
orders
to
the
huntsmen
and
others
to
follow
him
adding
that
he
himself
should
proceed
to
snow
hill
where
they
would
find
him
an
hour
hence
all
understood
why
the
king
wished
to
be
alone
and
for
what
purpose
he
was
about
to
repair
to
the
eminence
in
question
and
therefore
without
a
word
the
whole
company
started
off
in
the
chase
meanwhile
the
king
rode
slowly
through
the
woods
often
pausing
to
listen
to
the
distant
sounds
of
the
hunters
and
noticing
the
shadows
on
the
greensward
as
they
grew
shorter
and
proclaimed
the
approach
of
noon
at
length
he
arrived
at
snow
hill
and
stationed
himself
beneath
the
trees
on
its
summit
from
this
point
a
magnificent
view
of
the
castle
towering
over
its
pomp
of
woods
now
covered
with
foliage
of
the
most
vivid
green
was
commanded
the
morning
was
bright
and
beautiful
the
sky
cloudless
and
a
gentle
rain
had
fallen
over
night
which
had
tempered
the
air
and
freshened
the
leaves
and
the
greensward
the
birds
were
singing
blithely
in
the
trees
and
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
crouched
a
herd
of
deer
all
was
genial
and
delightful
breathing
of
tenderness
and
peace
calculated
to
soften
the
most
obdurate
heart
the
scene
was
not
without
its
effect
upon
henry
but
a
fierce
tumult
raged
within
his
breast
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
round
tower
which
was
distinctly
visible
and
from
which
he
expected
the
signal
and
then
tried
to
peer
into
the
far
horizon
but
he
could
discern
nothing
a
cloud
passed
over
the
sun
and
cast
a
momentary
gloom
over
the
smiling
landscape
at
the
same
time
henry
fancy
was
so
powerfully
excited
that
he
fancied
he
could
behold
the
terrible
tragedy
enacting
at
the
tower
she
is
now
issuing
forth
into
the
green
in
front
of
saint
chapel
said
henry
to
himself
i
can
see
her
as
distinctly
as
if
i
were
there
ah
how
beautiful
she
looks
and
how
she
moves
all
hearts
to
pity
suffolk
richmond
cromwell
and
the
lord
mayor
are
there
to
meet
her
she
takes
leave
of
her
weeping
attendants
she
mounts
the
steps
of
the
scaffold
firmly
she
looks
round
and
addresses
the
spectators
how
silent
they
are
and
how
clearly
and
musically
her
voice
sounds
she
blesses
i
hear
it
i
feel
it
here
now
she
disrobes
herself
and
prepares
for
the
fatal
axe
it
is
wielded
by
the
skilful
executioner
of
calais
and
he
is
now
feeling
its
edge
now
she
takes
leave
of
her
dames
and
bestows
a
parting
gift
on
each
again
she
kneels
and
prays
she
rises
the
fatal
moment
is
at
hand
even
now
she
retains
her
courage
she
approaches
the
block
and
places
her
head
upon
it
the
axe
is
raised
ha
the
exclamation
was
occasioned
by
a
flash
of
fire
from
the
battlements
of
the
round
tower
followed
by
a
volume
of
smoke
and
in
another
second
the
deep
boom
of
a
gun
was
heard
at
the
very
moment
that
the
flash
was
seen
a
wild
figure
mounted
on
a
steed
galloped
from
out
the
wood
and
dashed
towards
henry
whose
horse
reared
and
plunged
as
he
passed
there
spoke
the
knell
of
anne
boleyn
cried
herne
regarding
henry
sternly
and
pointing
to
the
round
tower
the
bloody
deed
is
done
and
thou
art
free
to
wed
once
more
away
to
wolff
hall
and
bring
thy
new
consort
to
windsor
castle
thus
ends
the
sixth
and
last
book
of
the
chronicle
of
windsor
castle
