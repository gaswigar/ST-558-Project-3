a
shorter
version
of
this
work
appeared
in
science
under
the
title
of
sweet
little
old
prologue
in
it
was
enemy
aliens
in
it
was
wobblies
in
it
was
and
in
nineteen
kenneth
malone
rolled
wearily
out
of
bed
wondering
what
the
hell
it
was
going
to
be
now
one
thing
he
told
himself
was
absolutely
certain
it
was
going
to
be
terrible
it
always
was
he
managed
to
stand
up
although
he
was
swaying
slightly
when
he
walked
across
the
room
to
the
mirror
for
his
usual
morning
look
at
himself
he
did
much
like
staring
at
his
own
face
first
thing
in
the
morning
but
then
he
told
himself
it
was
part
of
the
up
process
every
fbi
agent
had
to
go
through
you
had
to
learn
to
stand
up
and
take
it
when
things
got
rough
he
reminded
himself
he
blinked
and
looked
into
the
mirror
his
image
blinked
back
he
tried
a
smile
it
looked
pretty
horrible
he
thought
but
then
the
mirror
had
a
slight
ripple
in
it
and
the
ripple
distorted
everything
malone
face
looked
as
if
it
had
been
gently
patted
with
a
and
of
course
it
was
still
early
morning
and
that
meant
he
was
having
a
little
difficulty
in
focusing
his
eyes
vaguely
he
tried
to
remember
the
night
before
he
was
just
ending
his
vacation
and
he
thought
he
recalled
having
a
final
farewell
party
for
two
or
three
lovely
female
types
he
had
chanced
to
meet
in
what
was
still
the
world
finest
city
of
opportunity
washington
latest
ratio
to
one
the
party
had
been
a
classic
of
its
kind
complete
with
hot
and
cold
running
ideas
of
all
sorts
and
lots
and
lots
of
nice
powerful
liquor
malone
decided
sadly
that
the
ripple
was
in
the
mirror
but
in
his
head
he
stared
at
his
unshaven
face
blearily
blink
ripple
quite
impossible
he
told
himself
nobody
could
conceivably
look
as
horrible
as
kenneth
malone
thought
he
did
things
just
could
be
as
bad
as
all
that
ignoring
a
still
small
voice
which
asked
persistently
why
not
he
turned
away
from
the
mirror
and
set
about
finding
his
clothes
he
determined
to
take
his
time
about
getting
ready
for
work
after
all
nobody
could
really
complain
if
he
arrived
late
on
his
first
day
after
vacation
everybody
knew
how
tired
vacations
made
a
person
and
besides
there
was
probably
nothing
happening
anyway
things
had
he
recalled
with
faint
pleasure
been
pretty
quiet
lately
ever
since
the
counterfeiting
gang
he
caught
had
been
put
away
crime
seemed
to
have
dropped
to
the
nice
simple
levels
of
the
and
maybe
he
hoped
suddenly
he
be
able
to
spend
some
time
catching
up
on
his
scientific
techniques
or
his
math
or
pistol
practice
the
thought
of
pistol
practice
made
his
head
begin
to
throb
with
the
authority
of
a
true
hangover
there
were
fifty
or
sixty
small
gnomes
inside
his
skull
he
realized
all
of
them
with
tiny
little
hammers
they
were
mining
for
lead
the
lead
malone
said
aloud
is
farther
down
not
in
the
skull
the
gnomes
paid
him
no
attention
he
shut
his
eyes
and
tried
to
relax
the
gnomes
went
right
ahead
with
their
work
and
microscopic
regiments
of
eagle
scouts
began
marching
steadily
along
his
nerves
there
were
people
malone
had
always
understood
who
bounced
out
of
their
beds
and
greeted
each
new
day
with
a
smile
it
did
sound
possible
but
then
again
there
were
some
pretty
strange
people
the
head
of
that
counterfeiting
ring
for
instance
where
had
he
got
the
idea
of
picking
an
alias
like
andr√©
gide
clutching
at
his
whirling
thoughts
malone
opened
his
eyes
winced
and
began
to
get
dressed
at
least
he
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
peaceful
day
it
was
at
this
second
that
his
private
intercom
buzzed
malone
winced
again
to
hell
with
you
he
called
at
the
thing
but
the
buzz
went
on
ignoring
the
code
that
meant
he
knew
an
emergency
call
maybe
from
his
chief
of
section
maybe
even
from
higher
up
i
not
even
late
for
work
yet
he
complained
i
will
be
but
not
yet
what
are
they
screaming
about
there
was
of
course
only
one
way
to
find
out
he
shuffled
painfully
across
the
room
flipped
the
switch
and
said
malone
here
vaguely
he
wondered
if
it
were
true
he
certainly
did
feel
as
if
he
were
here
or
there
or
anywhere
at
all
in
fact
a
familiar
voice
came
tinnily
out
of
the
receiver
malone
get
down
here
right
away
the
voice
belonged
to
andrew
burris
malone
sighed
deeply
and
felt
grateful
for
the
fiftieth
time
that
he
had
never
had
a
tv
pickup
installed
in
the
intercom
he
did
want
the
fbi
chief
to
see
him
looking
as
horrible
as
he
did
now
all
rippled
and
everything
it
was
well
it
was
professional
that
was
all
i
get
dressed
right
away
he
assured
the
intercom
i
should
be
there
in
do
bother
to
get
dressed
burris
snapped
this
is
an
emergency
but
chief
and
do
call
me
chief
okay
malone
said
sure
you
want
me
to
come
down
in
my
pyjamas
right
i
want
you
to
burris
stopped
all
right
malone
if
you
want
to
waste
time
while
our
country
life
is
at
stake
you
go
ahead
get
dressed
after
all
malone
when
i
say
something
is
an
emergency
i
wo
get
dressed
then
malone
said
whatever
you
say
just
do
something
burris
told
him
desperately
your
country
needs
you
pyjamas
and
all
malone
it
a
crisis
conversations
with
burris
malone
told
himself
were
bound
to
be
a
little
confusing
i
be
right
down
he
said
fine
burris
said
and
hesitated
then
he
added
malone
do
you
wear
the
tops
or
the
bottoms
the
what
of
your
pyjamas
burris
explained
hurriedly
the
top
part
or
the
bottom
part
oh
malone
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
wear
both
good
burris
said
with
satisfaction
i
would
want
an
agent
of
mine
arrested
for
indecent
exposure
he
rang
off
malone
blinked
at
the
intercom
for
a
minute
shut
it
off
and
then
ignoring
the
in
his
skull
and
the
eagle
scouts
on
his
nerves
began
to
get
dressed
somehow
in
spite
of
burris
feelings
of
crisis
he
could
see
himself
trying
to
flag
a
taxi
on
the
streets
of
washington
in
his
pyjamas
anyhow
not
while
he
was
awake
i
dreamed
i
was
an
fbi
agent
he
thought
sadly
in
my
drafty
bvds
besides
it
was
probably
nothing
important
these
things
he
told
himself
severely
have
a
way
of
evaporating
as
soon
as
a
clear
cold
intelligence
got
hold
of
them
then
he
began
wondering
where
in
hell
he
was
going
to
find
a
clear
cold
intelligence
or
even
for
that
matter
what
one
was
they
could
be
anywhere
burris
said
with
an
expression
which
bordered
on
exasperated
horror
they
could
be
all
around
us
heaven
only
knows
he
pushed
his
chair
back
from
his
desk
and
stood
up
a
chunky
little
man
with
bright
blue
eyes
and
large
hands
he
paced
to
the
window
and
looked
out
at
washington
and
then
he
came
back
to
the
desk
a
persistent
office
rumor
held
that
he
had
become
head
of
the
fbi
purely
because
he
happened
to
have
an
initial
in
his
name
but
in
his
case
the
j
stood
for
jeremiah
and
at
the
moment
his
tone
expressed
all
the
hopelessness
of
that
old
testament
prophet
lamentations
we
helpless
he
said
looking
at
the
young
man
with
the
crisp
brown
hair
who
was
sitting
across
the
desk
that
what
it
is
helpless
kenneth
malone
tried
to
look
dependable
just
tell
me
what
to
do
he
said
you
a
good
agent
kenneth
burris
said
you
one
of
the
best
that
why
you
been
picked
for
this
job
and
i
want
to
say
that
i
picked
you
personally
believe
me
there
never
been
anything
like
it
before
i
do
my
best
malone
said
at
random
he
was
and
he
had
been
an
fbi
agent
for
three
years
in
that
time
he
had
among
other
things
managed
to
break
up
a
gang
of
smugglers
track
down
a
counterfeiting
ring
and
capture
three
kidnappers
for
reasons
which
he
could
neither
understand
nor
explain
no
one
seemed
willing
to
attribute
his
record
to
luck
i
know
you
will
burris
said
and
if
anybody
can
crack
this
case
malone
you
the
man
it
just
that
everything
sounds
so
even
after
all
the
conferences
we
had
conferences
malone
said
vaguely
he
wished
the
chief
would
get
to
the
point
any
point
he
smiled
gently
across
the
desk
and
tried
to
look
competent
and
dependable
and
reassuring
burris
expression
did
change
you
get
the
conference
tapes
later
burris
said
you
can
study
them
before
you
leave
i
suggest
you
study
them
very
carefully
malone
do
be
like
me
do
get
confused
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
malone
waited
patiently
after
a
few
seconds
burris
looked
up
did
you
read
books
when
you
were
a
child
he
asked
malone
said
what
books
burris
said
when
you
were
a
child
read
them
sure
i
did
malone
said
bomba
the
jungle
and
and
and
little
women
when
beth
died
malone
said
i
wanted
to
cry
but
i
did
my
father
said
big
boys
do
cry
and
your
father
was
right
burris
said
why
when
i
was
a
never
mind
forget
about
beth
and
your
father
think
about
lucky
starr
for
a
minute
remember
him
sure
malone
said
i
liked
those
books
you
know
it
funny
but
the
books
you
read
when
you
a
kid
they
kind
of
stay
with
you
know
what
i
mean
i
can
still
remember
that
one
about
venus
for
instance
gee
that
was
never
mind
about
venus
too
burris
said
sharply
keep
your
mind
on
the
problem
yes
sir
malone
said
he
paused
what
problem
sir
he
added
the
problem
we
discussing
burris
said
he
gave
malone
a
bright
blank
stare
my
god
he
said
just
listen
to
me
yes
sir
all
right
then
burris
took
a
deep
breath
he
seemed
nervous
once
again
he
stood
up
and
went
to
the
window
this
time
he
spoke
without
turning
remember
how
everybody
used
to
laugh
about
spaceships
and
orbital
satellites
and
life
on
other
planets
that
was
just
in
those
lucky
starr
books
that
was
all
just
for
kids
was
it
well
i
do
know
malone
said
slowly
sure
it
was
all
for
kids
burris
said
it
was
laughable
nobody
took
it
seriously
well
must
you
just
keep
quiet
and
listen
burris
said
yes
sir
malone
said
burris
nodded
his
hands
were
clasped
behind
his
back
we
not
laughing
any
more
are
we
malone
he
said
without
moving
there
was
silence
well
are
we
did
you
want
me
to
answer
sir
of
course
i
did
burris
snapped
you
told
me
to
keep
quiet
and
never
mind
what
i
told
you
burris
said
just
do
what
i
told
you
yes
sir
malone
said
no
sir
he
added
after
a
second
no
sir
what
burris
asked
softly
no
sir
we
not
laughing
any
more
malone
said
ah
burris
said
and
why
are
we
laughing
any
more
there
was
a
little
pause
malone
said
tentatively
because
nothing
to
laugh
about
sir
burris
whirled
on
the
head
he
said
happily
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
kenneth
i
knew
i
could
depend
on
you
his
voice
grew
serious
again
and
thoughtful
we
not
laughing
any
more
because
there
nothing
to
laugh
about
we
have
orbital
satellites
and
landed
on
the
moon
with
an
atomic
rocket
the
planets
are
the
next
step
and
after
that
the
stars
man
heritage
kenneth
the
stars
and
the
stars
kenneth
belong
to
man
not
to
the
russians
yes
sir
malone
said
soberly
so
burris
said
we
should
learn
not
to
laugh
any
more
but
have
we
i
do
know
sir
we
have
burris
said
with
decision
can
you
read
my
mind
no
sir
malone
said
can
i
read
your
mind
malone
hesitated
at
last
he
said
not
that
i
know
of
sir
well
i
ca
burris
snapped
and
can
any
of
us
read
each
mind
malone
shook
his
head
no
sir
he
said
burris
nodded
that
the
problem
he
said
that
the
case
sending
you
out
to
crack
this
time
the
silence
was
a
long
one
at
last
malone
said
what
problem
sir
mind
reading
burris
said
there
a
spy
at
work
in
the
nevada
plant
kenneth
and
the
spy
is
a
telepath
the
video
tapes
were
very
clear
and
very
complete
there
were
a
great
many
of
them
and
it
was
long
after
nine
when
kenneth
malone
decided
to
take
a
break
and
get
some
fresh
air
washington
was
a
good
city
for
walking
even
at
night
and
malone
liked
to
walk
sometimes
he
pretended
even
to
himself
that
he
got
his
best
ideas
while
walking
but
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
was
true
his
best
ideas
just
seemed
to
come
to
him
out
of
nowhere
precisely
as
the
situation
demanded
them
he
was
just
lucky
that
was
all
he
had
a
talent
for
being
lucky
but
nobody
would
ever
believe
that
a
record
like
his
was
spectacular
even
in
the
annals
of
the
fbi
and
burris
himself
believed
that
the
record
showed
some
kind
of
superior
ability
malone
knew
that
was
true
but
what
could
he
do
about
it
after
all
he
did
want
to
resign
did
he
it
was
kind
of
romantic
and
exciting
to
be
an
fbi
agent
even
after
three
years
a
man
got
a
chance
to
travel
around
a
lot
and
see
things
and
it
was
interesting
the
pay
was
pretty
good
too
the
only
trouble
was
that
if
he
did
quit
he
was
going
to
have
to
find
a
telepath
the
notion
of
telepathic
spies
just
did
sound
right
to
malone
it
bothered
him
in
a
remote
sort
of
way
not
that
the
idea
of
telepathy
itself
was
alien
to
him
after
all
he
was
even
more
aware
than
the
average
citizen
that
research
had
been
going
on
in
that
field
for
something
over
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
that
the
research
was
even
speeding
up
but
the
cold
fact
that
a
device
had
been
invented
somehow
shocked
his
sense
of
propriety
and
his
notions
of
privacy
it
was
decent
that
was
all
there
ought
to
be
something
sacred
he
told
himself
angrily
he
stopped
walking
and
looked
up
he
was
on
pennsylvania
avenue
heading
toward
the
white
house
that
was
no
good
he
went
to
the
corner
and
turned
off
down
the
block
he
had
he
told
himself
nothing
at
all
to
see
the
president
about
not
yet
anyhow
the
streets
were
dark
and
very
peaceful
get
my
best
ideas
while
malone
said
without
convincing
himself
he
thought
back
to
the
video
tapes
the
report
on
the
original
use
of
the
machine
itself
had
been
on
one
of
the
first
tapes
and
malone
could
still
see
and
hear
it
that
was
one
thing
he
did
have
he
reflected
his
memory
was
pretty
good
burris
had
been
the
first
speaker
on
the
tapes
and
he
given
the
serial
and
reference
number
in
a
cold
voice
his
face
had
been
perfectly
blank
and
he
looked
just
like
the
head
of
the
fbi
people
were
accustomed
to
seeing
on
their
tv
and
newsreel
screens
malone
wondered
what
had
happened
to
him
between
the
time
the
tapes
had
been
made
and
the
time
he
sent
for
malone
maybe
the
whole
notion
of
telepathy
was
beginning
to
get
him
malone
thought
burris
recited
the
standard
in
a
rapid
mumble
like
a
priest
involved
in
the
formula
of
the
mass
any
person
or
agent
unauthorized
for
this
tape
please
refrain
from
viewing
further
under
penalties
as
prescribed
by
law
then
he
looked
off
out
past
the
screen
to
the
left
and
said
thomas
of
westinghouse
laboratories
will
you
come
here
dr
came
into
the
lighted
square
of
screen
slowly
looking
all
around
him
this
is
very
fascinating
he
said
blinking
in
the
lamplight
i
had
realized
that
you
people
took
so
many
precautions
he
was
malone
thought
somewhere
between
fifty
and
sixty
tall
and
thin
with
skin
so
transparent
that
he
nearly
looked
like
a
living
ray
he
had
pale
blue
eyes
and
pale
white
hair
and
malone
thought
if
there
ever
were
a
contest
for
the
ghost
thomas
would
win
it
hands
or
phalanges
down
this
is
all
necessary
for
the
national
security
burris
said
a
little
sternly
oh
said
quickly
i
realize
that
of
course
naturally
i
can
certainly
see
that
let
go
ahead
shall
we
burris
said
nodded
certainly
certainly
burris
said
well
then
and
paused
after
a
second
he
started
again
now
would
you
please
give
us
a
sort
of
verbal
rundown
on
this
for
our
records
of
course
said
he
smiled
into
the
video
cameras
and
cleared
his
throat
i
take
it
you
do
want
an
explanation
of
how
this
machine
works
i
mean
you
do
want
a
technical
exposition
do
you
no
burris
said
and
added
not
by
any
means
just
tell
us
what
it
does
suddenly
reminded
malone
of
a
professor
he
had
in
college
for
one
of
the
law
courses
he
had
malone
thought
the
same
smiling
gravity
of
demeanor
the
same
condescending
attitude
of
absolute
authority
it
was
clear
that
lived
in
a
world
of
his
own
a
world
that
was
not
even
touched
by
the
common
run
of
men
well
he
began
to
put
it
very
simply
the
device
indicates
whether
or
not
a
man
mental
ah
processes
are
being
influenced
by
outside
by
outside
influences
he
gave
the
cameras
another
little
smile
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
demonstrate
on
the
machine
itself
he
took
two
steps
that
carried
him
out
of
camera
range
and
returned
wheeling
a
large
box
dangling
from
the
metal
covering
were
a
number
of
wires
and
attachments
a
long
cord
led
from
the
box
to
the
floor
and
snaked
out
of
sight
to
the
left
now
said
he
selected
a
single
lead
apparently
malone
thought
at
random
this
electrode
just
a
moment
doctor
burris
said
he
was
eyeing
the
machine
with
a
combination
of
suspicion
and
awe
a
while
back
you
mentioned
something
about
influences
just
what
specifically
does
that
mean
with
some
regret
dropped
the
lead
telepathy
he
said
by
outside
influences
i
meant
influences
on
the
mind
such
as
telepathy
or
of
some
nature
i
see
burris
said
you
can
detect
a
telepath
with
this
machine
i
afraid
well
some
kind
of
a
anyhow
burris
said
we
quarrel
about
terms
certainly
not
said
the
smile
he
turned
on
burris
was
as
cold
and
empty
as
the
inside
of
orbital
station
one
what
i
meant
was
if
you
will
permit
me
to
continue
that
we
can
not
detect
any
sort
of
telepathy
or
with
this
device
to
be
frank
i
very
much
wish
that
we
could
it
would
make
everything
a
great
deal
simpler
however
the
laws
of
psionics
do
seem
to
operate
that
way
well
then
burris
said
what
does
the
thing
do
his
face
wore
a
mask
of
confusion
momentarily
malone
felt
sorry
for
his
chief
he
could
remember
how
he
felt
himself
when
that
law
professor
had
come
up
with
a
particularly
baffling
question
in
class
this
machine
said
with
authority
detects
the
slight
variations
in
mental
activity
that
occur
when
a
person
mind
is
read
you
mean
if
my
mind
were
being
read
right
now
not
right
now
said
you
see
the
bulk
of
this
machine
is
in
nevada
the
structure
is
both
too
heavy
and
too
delicate
for
transport
and
there
are
other
qualifications
i
meant
theoretically
burris
said
theoretically
began
and
smiled
again
theoretically
if
your
mind
were
being
read
this
machine
would
detect
it
supposing
that
the
machine
were
in
operating
condition
and
all
of
the
other
qualifications
had
been
met
you
see
burris
no
matter
how
poor
a
telepath
a
man
may
be
he
has
some
slight
ability
even
if
only
very
slight
to
detect
the
fact
that
his
mind
is
being
read
you
mean
if
somebody
was
reading
my
mind
i
know
it
burris
said
his
face
showed
malone
realized
that
he
plainly
disbelieved
this
statement
you
would
know
it
said
but
you
would
never
know
you
knew
it
to
elucidate
in
a
normal
person
like
you
for
instance
or
even
like
myself
the
state
of
having
one
mind
read
merely
results
in
a
vague
almost
feeling
of
irritation
something
that
could
easily
be
attributed
to
minor
worries
or
fluctuations
in
hormonal
balance
the
hormonal
balance
burris
is
thank
you
burris
said
with
a
trace
of
irritation
i
know
what
hormones
are
ah
good
said
equably
in
any
case
to
continue
this
machine
interprets
those
specific
feelings
as
indications
that
the
mind
is
being
ah
upon
you
could
almost
see
the
quotation
marks
around
what
considered
slang
dropping
into
place
malone
thought
i
see
burris
said
with
a
disappointed
air
but
what
do
you
mean
it
wo
detect
a
telepath
have
you
ever
actually
worked
with
a
telepath
certainly
we
have
said
if
we
had
how
would
we
be
able
to
tell
that
the
machine
was
in
fact
indicating
the
presence
of
telepathy
the
theoretical
state
of
the
art
is
not
at
present
sufficiently
developed
to
enable
us
to
i
see
burris
said
hurriedly
only
wait
a
minute
yes
you
mean
you
actually
got
a
real
you
found
one
one
that
works
shook
his
head
sadly
i
afraid
i
should
have
said
burris
that
we
did
once
have
one
he
admitted
he
was
unfortunately
an
imbecile
with
a
mental
age
between
five
and
six
as
nearly
as
we
were
ever
able
to
judge
an
imbecile
burris
said
but
how
were
you
able
to
he
could
repeat
a
person
thoughts
word
for
word
said
of
course
he
was
utterly
incapable
of
understanding
the
meaning
behind
them
that
did
matter
he
simply
repeated
whatever
you
were
thinking
rather
disconcerting
i
sure
burris
said
but
he
was
really
an
imbecile
there
any
chance
of
of
curing
him
said
none
i
afraid
we
did
at
one
time
feel
that
there
had
been
a
mental
breakdown
early
in
the
life
and
indeed
it
perfectly
possible
that
he
was
normal
for
the
first
year
or
so
the
records
we
did
manage
to
get
on
that
period
however
were
very
much
confused
and
there
was
never
any
way
of
telling
anything
at
all
for
certain
it
easy
to
see
what
caused
the
confusion
of
course
telepathy
in
an
imbecile
is
rather
an
oddity
and
any
normal
adult
would
probably
be
rather
hesitant
about
admitting
that
he
was
capable
of
it
that
why
we
have
not
found
another
subject
we
must
merely
sit
back
and
wait
for
lightning
to
strike
burris
sighed
i
see
your
problem
he
said
but
what
happened
to
this
imbecile
boy
of
yours
very
sad
said
six
months
ago
at
the
age
of
fifteen
the
boy
simply
died
he
simply
gave
up
and
died
gave
up
that
was
as
good
an
explanation
as
our
medical
department
was
able
to
provide
burris
there
was
some
malfunction
but
we
like
to
say
that
he
simply
gave
up
living
became
too
difficult
for
him
all
right
burris
said
after
a
pause
this
telepath
of
yours
is
dead
and
there
are
any
more
where
he
came
from
or
if
there
are
you
do
know
how
to
look
for
them
all
right
but
to
get
back
to
this
machine
of
yours
it
could
detect
the
boy
ability
shook
his
head
no
i
afraid
not
we
worked
hard
on
that
problem
at
westinghouse
burris
but
we
have
yet
been
able
to
find
a
method
of
actually
detecting
telepaths
but
you
can
detect
that
right
said
we
can
detect
the
fact
that
a
man
mind
is
being
read
he
stopped
and
his
face
became
suddenly
morose
when
he
spoke
again
he
sounded
guilty
as
if
he
were
making
an
admission
that
pained
him
of
course
burris
there
nothing
we
can
do
about
a
man
mind
being
read
nothing
whatever
he
essayed
a
grin
that
did
look
very
healthy
but
at
least
he
said
you
know
you
being
spied
on
burris
grimaced
there
was
a
little
silence
while
stroked
the
metal
box
meditatively
as
if
it
were
the
head
of
his
beloved
at
last
burris
said
how
sure
can
you
be
of
all
this
the
look
he
received
made
all
the
previous
conversation
seem
as
warm
and
friendly
as
a
christmas
party
by
comparison
it
was
a
look
that
froze
the
air
of
the
room
into
a
solid
chunk
malone
thought
a
chunk
you
could
have
chipped
pieces
from
for
souvenirs
later
when
had
gone
and
you
could
get
into
the
room
without
any
danger
of
being
by
the
man
unfriendly
eye
burris
said
in
a
voice
that
matched
the
temperature
of
his
gaze
please
remember
our
slogan
malone
sighed
he
fished
in
his
pocket
for
a
pack
of
cigarettes
found
one
and
extracted
a
single
cigarette
he
stuck
it
in
his
mouth
and
started
fishing
in
various
pockets
for
his
lighter
he
sighed
again
perfectly
honestly
he
preferred
cigars
a
habit
acquired
from
the
days
when
he
filched
them
from
his
father
case
but
his
mental
picture
of
a
fearless
and
alert
young
fbi
agent
did
include
a
cigar
somehow
remembering
his
father
as
neither
fearless
nor
exactly
alert
anyway
not
the
way
the
movies
and
the
tv
screens
liked
to
picture
the
words
he
had
the
impression
that
cigars
looked
out
of
place
on
fbi
agents
and
it
was
in
any
case
a
small
sacrifice
to
make
he
found
his
lighter
and
shielded
it
from
the
brisk
wind
he
looked
out
over
water
at
the
jefferson
memorial
and
was
surprised
that
he
managed
to
walk
as
far
as
he
had
then
he
stopped
thinking
about
walking
and
took
a
puff
of
his
cigarette
and
forced
himself
to
think
about
the
job
in
hand
naturally
the
westinghouse
gadget
had
been
declared
ultra
top
secret
as
soon
as
it
had
been
worked
out
virtually
everything
was
these
days
and
the
whole
group
involved
in
the
machine
and
its
workings
had
been
transferred
without
delay
to
the
united
states
laboratories
out
in
yucca
flats
nevada
out
there
in
the
desert
there
just
was
much
to
do
malone
supposed
except
to
play
with
the
machine
and
of
course
look
at
the
scenery
but
when
you
seen
one
desert
malone
thought
confusedly
you
seen
them
all
so
the
scientists
ran
experiments
on
the
machine
and
they
made
a
discovery
of
a
kind
they
had
been
looking
for
somebody
they
discovered
was
picking
the
brains
of
the
scientists
there
not
the
brains
of
the
people
working
with
the
telepathy
machine
and
not
the
brains
of
the
people
working
on
the
several
other
limited
projects
at
yucca
flats
they
been
reading
the
minds
of
some
of
the
scientists
working
on
the
new
and
highly
classified
space
drive
in
other
words
the
yucca
flats
plant
was
infested
with
a
telepathic
spy
and
how
do
you
go
about
finding
a
telepath
malone
sighed
spies
that
got
information
in
any
of
the
usual
ways
were
tough
enough
to
locate
a
telepathic
spy
was
a
lot
tougher
proposition
well
one
thing
about
andrew
burris
he
had
an
answer
for
everything
malone
thought
of
what
his
chief
had
said
it
takes
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
and
if
the
westinghouse
machine
wo
locate
a
telepathic
spy
i
know
what
will
what
malone
had
asked
it
simple
burris
had
said
another
telepath
there
has
to
be
one
around
somewhere
westinghouse
did
have
one
after
all
and
the
russians
have
one
malone
that
your
job
go
out
and
find
me
a
telepath
burris
had
an
answer
for
everything
all
right
malone
thought
but
he
could
see
where
the
answer
did
him
very
much
good
after
all
if
it
takes
a
telepath
to
catch
a
telepath
how
do
you
catch
the
telepath
you
going
to
use
to
catch
the
first
telepath
malone
ran
that
through
his
mind
again
and
then
gave
it
up
it
sounded
as
if
it
should
have
made
sense
somehow
but
it
just
did
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
that
he
dropped
his
cigarette
to
the
ground
and
mashed
it
out
with
the
toe
of
his
shoe
then
he
looked
up
out
there
over
the
water
was
the
jefferson
memorial
it
stood
white
in
the
floodlights
beautiful
and
untouchable
in
the
darkness
malone
stared
at
it
what
would
thomas
jefferson
have
done
in
a
crisis
like
this
jefferson
he
told
himself
without
much
conviction
would
have
been
just
as
confused
as
he
was
but
he
have
had
to
find
a
telepath
malone
thought
malone
determined
that
he
would
do
likewise
if
thomas
jefferson
could
do
it
the
least
he
malone
could
do
was
to
give
it
a
good
try
there
was
only
one
little
problem
malone
thought
i
start
looking
early
the
next
morning
malone
awoke
on
a
plane
heading
across
the
continent
toward
nevada
he
had
gone
home
to
sleep
and
he
had
to
wake
up
to
get
on
the
plane
and
now
here
he
was
waking
up
again
it
seemed
somehow
like
a
vicious
circle
the
engines
hummed
gently
as
they
pushed
the
big
ship
through
the
middle
stratosphere
thinly
distributed
molecules
malone
looked
out
at
the
sky
and
set
himself
to
think
out
his
problem
again
he
was
still
mulling
things
over
when
the
ship
lowered
its
landing
gear
and
rolled
to
a
stop
on
the
big
field
near
yucca
flats
malone
sighed
and
climbed
slowly
out
of
his
seat
there
was
a
car
waiting
for
him
at
the
airfield
though
and
that
seemed
to
presage
a
smooth
time
malone
remembered
calling
the
night
before
and
congratulated
himself
on
his
foresight
unfortunately
when
he
reached
the
main
gate
of
the
high
double
fence
that
surrounded
the
more
than
ninety
square
miles
of
united
states
laboratories
he
found
out
that
entrance
into
that
sanctum
sanctorum
of
security
was
as
easy
as
he
imagined
not
even
for
an
fbi
man
his
credentials
were
checked
with
the
kind
of
minute
care
malone
had
always
thought
people
reserved
for
disputed
art
masterpieces
and
it
was
with
a
great
show
of
reluctance
that
the
special
security
guards
passed
him
inside
as
far
as
the
office
of
the
chief
security
officer
there
the
chief
security
officer
himself
a
man
who
could
have
doubled
for
torquemada
eyed
malone
with
suspicion
while
he
called
burris
at
fbi
headquarters
back
in
washington
burris
identified
malone
on
the
video
screen
and
the
chief
security
officer
looking
faintly
disappointed
stamped
the
agent
pass
and
thanked
the
fbi
chief
malone
had
the
run
of
the
place
then
he
had
to
find
a
courier
jeep
the
westinghouse
division
it
seemed
was
a
good
two
miles
away
as
malone
knew
perfectly
well
the
main
portion
of
the
entire
yucca
flats
area
was
devoted
solely
to
research
on
the
new
space
drive
which
was
expected
to
make
the
rocket
as
obsolete
as
the
blunderbuss
at
least
as
far
as
space
travel
was
concerned
not
malone
thought
uneasily
that
the
blunderbuss
had
ever
been
used
for
space
travel
but
he
got
off
the
subject
hurriedly
the
jeep
whizzed
by
buildings
most
of
them
devoted
to
aspects
of
the
drive
the
other
projects
based
at
yucca
flats
had
to
share
what
space
was
left
and
that
included
of
course
the
westinghouse
research
project
it
turned
out
to
be
a
single
rather
small
white
building
with
a
fence
around
it
the
fence
bothered
malone
a
little
but
there
was
no
need
to
worry
this
time
he
was
introduced
at
once
into
office
it
was
paneled
in
wallpaper
manufactured
to
look
like
pine
and
the
telepathy
expert
sat
behind
a
large
black
desk
bigger
than
any
malone
had
ever
seen
in
the
fbi
offices
there
was
a
scrap
of
paper
on
the
desk
its
surface
was
smooth
and
shiny
and
behind
it
the
nearly
transparent
thomas
was
close
to
invisible
he
looked
in
person
just
about
the
same
as
he
looked
on
the
fbi
tapes
malone
closed
the
door
of
the
office
behind
him
looked
for
a
chair
and
did
find
one
in
office
it
was
perfectly
obvious
sat
down
you
stood
and
were
uncomfortable
malone
took
off
his
hat
he
reached
across
the
desk
to
shake
hands
with
the
telepathy
expert
and
gave
him
a
limp
fragile
paw
thanks
for
giving
me
a
little
time
malone
said
i
really
appreciate
it
he
smiled
across
the
desk
his
feet
were
already
beginning
to
hurt
not
at
all
said
returning
the
smile
with
one
of
his
own
special
brand
i
realize
how
important
fbi
work
is
to
all
of
us
malone
what
can
i
do
to
help
you
malone
shifted
his
feet
i
afraid
i
was
very
specific
on
the
phone
last
night
he
said
it
was
anything
i
wanted
to
discuss
over
a
line
that
might
have
been
tapped
you
see
i
on
the
telepathy
case
eyes
widened
the
merest
trifle
i
see
he
said
well
i
certainly
do
everything
i
can
to
help
you
fine
malone
said
let
get
right
down
to
business
then
the
first
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
about
is
this
detector
of
yours
i
understand
it
too
big
to
carry
around
but
how
about
making
a
smaller
model
smaller
permitted
himself
a
ghostly
chuckle
afraid
that
is
possible
malone
i
would
be
happy
to
let
you
have
a
small
model
of
the
machine
if
we
had
one
available
more
than
happy
i
would
like
to
see
such
a
machine
myself
as
a
matter
of
fact
unfortunately
malone
there
just
is
one
right
malone
said
correct
said
and
there
are
a
few
other
factors
in
the
first
place
the
person
being
analyzed
has
to
be
in
a
specially
shielded
room
such
as
is
used
in
encephalographic
analysis
otherwise
the
mental
activity
of
the
other
persons
around
him
would
interfere
with
the
analysis
he
frowned
a
little
i
could
wish
that
we
knew
a
bit
more
about
psionic
machines
the
trouble
with
the
present
device
frankly
is
that
it
is
partly
psionic
and
partly
electronic
and
we
ca
be
entirely
sure
where
one
part
leaves
off
and
the
other
begins
very
trying
very
trying
indeed
i
bet
it
is
malone
said
sympathetically
wishing
he
understood
what
was
talking
about
the
telepathy
expert
sighed
however
he
said
we
keep
working
at
it
then
he
looked
at
malone
expectantly
malone
shrugged
well
if
i
ca
carry
the
thing
around
i
guess
that
that
he
said
but
here
the
next
question
do
you
happen
to
know
the
maximum
range
of
a
telepath
i
mean
how
far
away
can
he
get
from
another
person
and
still
read
his
mind
frowned
again
we
do
have
definite
information
on
that
i
afraid
he
said
poor
little
charlie
was
rather
difficult
to
work
with
he
was
mentally
incapable
of
cooperating
in
any
way
you
see
little
charlie
charles
was
the
name
of
the
telepath
we
worked
with
explained
i
remember
malone
said
the
name
had
been
on
one
of
the
tapes
but
he
just
had
associated
charles
with
little
charlie
he
felt
as
if
he
been
caught
with
his
homework
undone
how
did
you
manage
to
find
him
anyway
he
said
maybe
if
he
knew
how
westinghouse
had
found
their
he
have
some
kind
of
clue
that
would
enable
him
to
find
one
too
anyhow
it
was
worth
a
try
it
was
difficult
in
charlie
case
said
he
smiled
the
child
babbled
all
the
time
you
see
you
mean
he
talked
about
being
a
telepath
shook
his
head
impatiently
no
he
said
not
at
all
i
mean
that
he
babbled
literally
here
i
got
a
sample
recording
in
my
files
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
went
to
the
tall
gray
filing
cabinet
that
hid
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
from
a
drawer
he
extracted
a
spool
of
common
audio
tape
and
returned
to
his
desk
i
sorry
we
did
get
full
video
on
this
he
said
but
we
feel
it
was
necessary
he
opened
a
panel
in
the
upper
surface
of
the
desk
and
slipped
the
spool
in
if
you
like
there
are
other
tapes
maybe
later
malone
said
nodded
and
pressed
the
playback
switch
at
the
side
of
the
great
desk
for
a
second
the
room
was
silent
then
there
was
the
hiss
of
empty
tape
and
a
brisk
masculine
voice
that
overrode
it
westinghouse
laboratories
it
said
sixteen
april
walker
speaking
the
voice
you
are
about
to
hear
belongs
to
charles
chronological
age
fourteen
years
three
months
mental
age
approximately
five
years
further
data
on
this
case
will
be
found
in
the
file
there
was
a
slight
pause
filled
with
more
tape
hiss
then
the
voice
began
push
the
switch
for
record
in
the
park
last
wednesday
and
perhaps
a
different
set
of
poor
kid
never
makes
any
sense
in
trees
and
leaves
all
sunny
with
the
electronic
components
of
the
reducing
stage
might
be
not
as
predictable
when
others
are
around
but
to
go
with
sally
some
night
in
the
it
was
a
childish
alto
voice
gabbling
in
a
monotone
a
phrase
would
be
spoken
the
voice
would
hesitate
for
just
an
instant
and
then
another
totally
disconnected
phrase
would
come
the
enunciation
and
pronunciation
would
vary
from
phrase
to
phrase
but
the
tone
remained
essentially
the
same
drained
of
all
emotional
content
in
receiving
psychocerebral
impulses
there
is
any
nonsense
and
nothing
but
nonsense
all
the
tomorrow
or
maybe
saturday
with
the
girl
tube
might
be
replaceable
only
if
something
ought
to
be
done
for
the
saturday
would
be
a
good
time
for
work
on
the
schematics
tonight
if
there
was
a
click
as
the
tape
was
turned
off
and
looked
up
it
does
make
much
sense
malone
said
but
the
kid
sure
has
a
hell
of
a
vocabulary
for
an
imbecile
vocabulary
said
softly
that
right
malone
said
where
an
imbecile
get
words
like
i
do
think
i
know
what
that
means
myself
ah
said
but
that
not
vocabulary
you
see
what
charlie
is
doing
is
simply
repeating
the
thoughts
of
those
around
him
he
jumps
from
mind
to
mind
simply
repeating
whatever
he
receives
his
face
assumed
the
expression
of
a
man
remembering
a
bad
taste
in
his
mouth
that
how
we
found
him
out
malone
he
said
it
rather
startling
to
look
at
a
blithering
idiot
and
have
him
suddenly
repeat
the
very
thought
that
in
your
mind
malone
nodded
unhappily
it
did
seem
as
if
information
was
going
to
be
a
lot
of
help
as
far
as
catching
a
telepath
was
concerned
an
imbecile
apparently
would
give
himself
away
if
he
were
a
telepath
but
nobody
else
seemed
to
be
likely
to
do
that
and
imbeciles
did
look
like
very
good
material
for
catching
spies
with
then
he
brightened
doctor
is
it
possible
that
the
spy
we
looking
for
really
is
a
spy
eh
i
mean
suppose
he
an
imbecile
too
i
doubt
whether
an
imbecile
would
really
be
a
spy
if
you
see
what
i
mean
appeared
to
consider
the
notion
after
a
little
while
he
said
it
is
i
suppose
possible
but
the
readings
on
the
machine
do
give
us
the
same
timing
as
they
did
in
charlie
case
or
even
the
same
sort
of
timing
i
do
quite
follow
you
malone
said
truthfully
he
felt
about
three
miles
behind
but
perhaps
everything
would
clear
up
soon
he
hoped
so
on
top
of
everything
else
his
feet
were
now
hurting
a
lot
more
perhaps
if
i
describe
one
of
the
tests
we
ran
said
things
will
be
somewhat
clearer
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
malone
shifted
his
feet
again
and
transferred
his
hat
from
his
right
to
his
left
hand
we
put
one
of
our
test
subjects
in
the
insulated
room
said
and
connected
him
to
the
detector
he
was
to
read
from
a
book
a
book
that
was
not
too
common
this
was
of
course
to
obviate
the
chance
that
some
other
person
nearby
might
be
reading
it
or
might
have
read
it
in
the
past
we
picked
blood
is
the
by
hieronymus
melanchthon
which
as
you
may
know
is
a
very
rare
book
indeed
sure
malone
said
he
had
never
heard
of
the
book
but
he
was
after
all
willing
to
take
word
for
it
the
telepathy
expert
went
on
our
test
subject
read
it
carefully
scanning
rather
than
skimming
cameras
recorded
the
movements
of
his
eyes
in
order
for
us
to
tell
just
what
he
was
reading
at
any
given
moment
in
order
to
correlate
what
was
going
on
in
his
mind
with
the
reactions
of
the
machine
indicators
if
you
follow
me
malone
nodded
helplessly
at
the
same
time
continued
blithely
we
had
charlie
in
a
nearby
room
recording
his
babblings
every
so
often
he
would
come
out
with
quotations
from
blood
is
the
and
these
quotations
corresponded
exactly
with
what
our
test
subject
was
reading
at
the
time
and
also
corresponded
with
the
abnormal
fluctuations
of
the
detector
paused
something
malone
realized
was
expected
of
him
he
thought
of
several
responses
and
chose
one
i
see
he
said
but
the
important
thing
here
said
is
the
timing
you
see
charlie
was
incapable
of
continued
concentration
he
could
not
keep
his
mind
focused
on
another
mind
for
very
long
before
he
hopped
to
still
another
the
actual
amount
of
time
concentrated
on
any
given
mind
at
any
single
given
period
varied
from
a
minimum
of
one
point
three
seconds
to
a
maximum
of
two
point
six
the
timing
samples
when
plotted
graphically
over
a
period
of
several
months
formed
a
skewed
bell
curve
with
a
mode
at
two
point
oh
seconds
ah
malone
said
wondering
if
a
skewed
ball
curve
was
the
same
thing
as
a
belled
skew
curve
and
if
not
why
not
it
was
in
fact
continued
relentlessly
a
sudden
variation
in
those
timings
which
convinced
us
that
there
was
another
telepath
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
we
were
conducting
a
second
set
of
reading
experiments
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
the
first
set
and
for
the
first
part
of
the
experiment
our
figures
were
substantially
the
same
but
he
stopped
yes
malone
said
shifting
his
feet
and
trying
to
take
some
weight
off
his
left
foot
by
standing
on
his
right
leg
then
he
stood
on
his
left
leg
it
did
seem
to
do
any
good
i
should
explain
said
that
we
were
conducting
this
series
with
a
new
set
of
test
subjects
some
of
the
scientists
here
at
yucca
flats
we
wanted
to
see
if
the
intelligence
quotients
of
the
subjects
affected
the
time
of
contact
which
charlie
was
able
to
maintain
naturally
we
picked
the
men
here
with
the
highest
iq
the
two
men
we
have
who
are
in
the
top
echelon
of
the
creative
genius
class
he
cleared
his
throat
i
did
not
include
myself
of
course
since
i
wished
to
remain
an
impartial
observer
as
much
as
possible
of
course
malone
said
without
surprise
the
other
two
geniuses
said
the
other
two
geniuses
both
happen
to
be
connected
with
the
project
known
as
project
isle
an
operation
whose
function
i
neither
know
nor
care
to
know
anything
at
all
about
malone
nodded
project
isle
was
the
spaceship
classified
top
secret
ultra
secret
and
he
thought
just
about
anything
else
you
could
think
of
at
first
was
saying
our
detector
recorded
the
time
periods
of
ah
mental
invasion
as
being
the
same
as
before
then
one
day
anomalies
began
to
appear
the
detector
showed
that
the
minds
of
our
subjects
were
being
held
for
as
long
as
two
or
three
minutes
but
the
phrases
repeated
by
charlie
during
these
periods
showed
that
his
own
contact
time
remained
the
same
that
is
they
fell
within
the
same
skewed
bell
curve
as
before
and
the
mode
remained
constant
if
nothing
but
the
phrase
length
were
recorded
hmm
malone
said
feeling
that
he
ought
to
be
saying
something
did
notice
him
at
first
we
thought
of
errors
in
the
detector
machine
he
went
on
that
worried
us
not
somewhat
since
our
understanding
of
the
detector
is
definitely
limited
at
this
time
we
do
feel
that
it
would
be
possible
to
replace
some
of
the
electronic
components
with
appropriate
symbolization
like
that
already
used
in
the
purely
psionic
sections
but
we
have
as
yet
been
unable
to
determine
exactly
which
electronic
components
must
be
replaced
by
what
symbolic
components
malone
nodded
silently
this
time
he
had
the
sudden
feeling
that
flow
of
words
had
broken
itself
up
into
a
vast
sea
of
alphabet
soup
and
that
he
malone
was
occupied
in
drowning
in
it
however
said
breaking
what
was
left
of
malone
train
of
thought
young
charlie
died
soon
thereafter
and
we
decided
to
go
on
checking
the
machine
it
was
during
this
period
that
we
found
someone
else
reading
the
minds
of
our
test
subjects
sometimes
for
a
few
seconds
sometimes
for
several
minutes
aha
malone
said
things
were
beginning
to
make
sense
again
that
of
course
was
the
spy
i
found
said
on
interrogating
the
subjects
more
closely
that
they
were
in
effect
thinking
on
two
levels
they
were
reading
the
book
mechanically
noting
the
words
and
sense
but
simply
shuttling
the
material
directly
into
their
memories
without
actually
thinking
about
it
the
actual
thinking
portions
of
their
minds
were
concentrating
on
aspects
of
project
isle
there
was
a
little
silence
in
other
words
malone
said
someone
was
spying
on
them
for
information
about
project
isle
precisely
said
with
a
frosty
smile
and
whoever
it
was
had
a
much
higher
concentration
time
than
charlie
had
ever
attained
he
seems
to
be
able
to
retain
contact
as
long
as
he
can
find
useful
information
flowing
in
the
mind
being
read
wait
a
minute
malone
said
wait
a
minute
if
this
spy
is
so
clever
how
come
he
did
read
mind
it
is
very
likely
that
he
has
said
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
it
well
malone
said
if
he
knows
you
and
your
group
are
working
on
telepathy
and
can
detect
what
he
doing
why
did
he
just
hold
off
on
the
minds
of
those
geniuses
when
they
were
being
tested
in
your
machine
frowned
i
afraid
that
i
ca
be
sure
he
said
and
it
was
clear
from
his
tone
that
if
thomas
was
sure
no
one
in
the
entire
world
was
had
been
or
ever
would
be
i
do
have
a
theory
however
he
said
brightening
up
a
trifle
malone
waited
patiently
he
must
know
our
limitations
said
at
last
he
must
be
perfectly
well
aware
that
there
not
a
single
thing
we
can
about
him
he
must
know
that
we
can
neither
find
nor
stop
him
why
should
he
worry
he
can
afford
to
ignore
us
or
even
bait
us
we
helpless
and
he
knows
it
that
malone
thought
was
about
the
most
cheerless
thought
he
had
heard
in
sometime
you
mentioned
that
you
had
an
insulated
room
the
fbi
agent
said
after
a
while
could
you
let
your
men
think
in
there
sighed
the
room
is
shielded
against
magnetic
fields
and
radiation
it
is
perfectly
transparent
to
psionic
phenomena
just
as
it
is
to
gravitational
fields
oh
malone
said
he
realized
rapidly
that
his
question
had
been
a
little
silly
to
begin
with
since
the
insulated
room
had
been
the
place
where
all
the
tests
had
been
conducted
in
the
first
place
i
do
want
to
take
up
too
much
of
your
time
doctor
he
said
after
a
pause
but
there
are
a
couple
of
other
questions
go
right
ahead
said
i
sure
i
be
able
to
help
you
malone
thought
of
mentioning
how
little
help
the
doctor
had
been
to
date
but
decided
against
it
why
antagonize
a
perfectly
good
scientist
without
any
reason
instead
he
selected
his
first
question
and
asked
it
have
you
got
any
idea
how
we
might
lay
our
hands
on
another
telepath
preferably
one
that
not
an
imbecile
of
course
expression
changed
from
patient
wisdom
to
irritation
i
wish
we
could
malone
i
wish
we
could
we
certainly
need
one
here
to
help
us
here
with
our
work
and
i
sure
that
your
work
is
important
too
but
i
afraid
we
have
no
ideas
at
all
about
finding
another
telepath
finding
little
charlie
was
purely
fortuitous
purely
malone
fortuitous
ah
malone
said
sure
of
course
he
thought
rapidly
and
discovered
that
he
could
come
up
with
one
more
question
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
asked
a
couple
of
questions
already
and
he
could
barely
remember
the
answers
well
he
said
i
guess
that
about
it
then
doctor
if
you
come
across
anything
else
be
sure
and
let
me
know
he
leaned
across
the
desk
extending
a
hand
and
thanks
for
your
time
he
added
stood
up
and
shook
his
hand
no
trouble
i
assure
you
he
said
and
i
certainly
give
you
all
the
information
i
can
malone
turned
and
walked
out
surprisingly
he
discovered
that
his
feet
and
legs
still
worked
he
had
thought
they
turned
to
stone
in
the
office
long
before
it
was
on
the
plane
back
to
washington
that
malone
got
his
first
inkling
of
an
idea
the
only
telepath
that
the
westinghouse
boys
had
been
able
to
turn
up
was
charles
the
youthful
imbecile
all
right
then
suppose
there
were
another
like
him
imbeciles
were
very
difficult
to
locate
most
of
them
would
be
in
institutions
and
the
others
would
certainly
be
on
record
it
might
be
possible
to
find
someone
anyway
who
could
be
handled
and
used
as
a
tool
to
find
a
telepathic
spy
and
happy
thought
maybe
one
of
them
would
turn
out
to
be
a
grade
imbecile
or
even
a
moron
even
if
they
only
turned
up
another
imbecile
he
thought
wearily
at
least
would
have
something
to
work
with
he
reported
back
to
burris
when
he
arrived
in
washington
told
him
about
the
interview
with
and
explained
what
had
come
to
seem
a
rather
feeble
brainstorm
it
does
seem
too
productive
burris
said
with
a
shade
of
disappointment
in
his
voice
but
we
try
it
at
that
it
was
a
better
verdict
than
malone
had
tried
for
though
of
course
it
meant
extra
work
for
him
orders
went
out
to
field
agents
all
over
the
united
states
and
quietly
but
efficiently
the
fbi
went
to
work
agents
began
to
probe
and
pry
and
poke
their
noses
into
the
files
and
data
sheets
of
every
mental
institution
in
the
fifty
states
as
far
at
any
rate
as
they
were
able
and
kenneth
malone
was
in
the
lead
there
had
been
some
talk
of
his
staying
in
washington
to
collate
the
reports
as
they
came
in
but
that
had
sounded
even
worse
than
having
to
visit
hospitals
you
do
need
me
to
do
a
job
like
that
told
burris
let
face
it
chief
if
we
find
a
telepath
the
agent
who
finds
him
will
say
so
if
we
do
he
say
that
too
you
could
get
a
chimpanzee
to
collate
reports
like
that
burris
looked
at
him
speculatively
and
for
one
horrible
second
malone
could
almost
hear
him
sending
out
an
order
to
find
and
hire
a
chimpanzee
after
security
clearance
of
course
for
whatever
organizations
a
chimpanzee
could
join
but
all
he
said
in
what
was
almost
a
mild
voice
was
all
right
malone
and
do
call
me
chief
the
very
mildness
of
his
tone
showed
how
worried
the
man
was
malone
realized
and
he
set
out
for
the
first
hospital
on
his
own
list
with
grim
determination
written
all
over
his
face
and
a
heartbeat
that
seemed
to
hammer
at
him
that
his
country
expected
every
man
to
do
his
duty
i
find
my
duty
hard
to
do
today
he
murmured
under
his
breath
it
was
all
right
to
tell
himself
that
he
had
to
find
a
telepath
but
how
did
you
go
about
it
did
you
just
knock
on
hospital
doors
and
ask
them
if
they
had
anybody
who
could
read
minds
you
know
malone
told
himself
in
a
surprised
tone
that
is
such
a
bad
idea
it
would
at
any
rate
let
him
know
whether
the
hospital
had
any
patients
who
they
could
read
minds
from
them
on
it
would
probably
be
simple
to
apply
a
test
and
separate
the
telepathic
sheep
from
the
psychotic
goats
the
image
that
created
in
his
mind
was
so
odd
that
malone
in
defense
stopped
thinking
altogether
until
he
reached
the
first
hospital
a
small
place
situated
in
the
shrinking
countryside
west
of
washington
it
was
called
he
knew
the
rice
pavilion
the
place
was
small
and
white
it
bore
a
faint
resemblance
to
monticello
but
then
that
was
true
malone
reflected
of
eight
out
of
ten
public
buildings
of
all
sorts
the
front
door
was
large
and
opaque
and
malone
went
up
the
winding
driveway
climbed
a
short
flight
of
marble
steps
and
rapped
sharply
the
door
opened
instantly
yes
said
the
man
inside
a
tall
balding
fellow
wearing
doctor
whites
and
a
sad
expression
yes
malone
said
automatically
i
mean
my
name
is
kenneth
j
malone
mine
said
the
bloodhound
is
blake
doctor
andrew
blake
there
was
a
brief
pause
is
there
anything
we
can
do
for
you
the
doctor
went
on
well
malone
said
i
looking
for
people
who
can
read
minds
blake
did
seem
at
all
surprised
he
nodded
quietly
of
course
he
said
i
understand
perfectly
good
malone
told
him
you
see
i
thought
i
have
a
little
trouble
finding
oh
no
trouble
at
all
i
assure
you
blake
went
on
just
as
mournfully
as
ever
you
come
to
the
right
place
believe
me
ah
malone
malone
said
kenneth
j
frankly
i
did
think
i
hit
the
jackpot
this
early
i
mean
you
were
the
first
on
my
list
the
doctor
seemed
suddenly
to
realize
that
the
two
of
them
were
standing
out
on
the
portico
wo
you
come
inside
he
said
with
a
friendly
gesture
he
stepped
aside
and
malone
walked
through
the
doorway
just
inside
it
three
men
grabbed
him
malone
surprised
by
this
sudden
reception
fought
with
every
ounce
of
his
fbi
training
but
the
three
men
had
his
surprise
on
their
side
and
three
against
one
was
heavy
odds
for
any
man
trained
or
not
his
neck
placed
firmly
between
one
upper
and
lower
arm
his
legs
pinioned
and
his
arms
flailing
wildly
malone
managed
to
shout
what
the
hell
is
this
what
going
on
blake
was
watching
the
entire
operation
from
a
standpoint
a
few
feet
away
he
did
look
as
if
his
expression
were
ever
going
to
change
it
all
for
your
own
good
malone
he
said
calmly
please
believe
me
my
god
malone
said
he
caught
somebody
face
with
one
hand
and
then
somebody
else
grabbed
the
hand
and
folded
it
back
with
irresistible
force
he
had
one
arm
free
and
he
tried
to
use
it
but
not
for
long
you
think
i
nuts
he
shouted
as
the
three
men
produced
a
from
somewhere
and
began
to
cram
him
into
it
wait
he
cried
as
the
canvas
began
to
cramp
him
you
wrong
you
making
a
terrible
mistake
of
course
blake
said
but
if
you
just
relax
we
soon
be
able
to
help
you
the
was
on
malone
sagged
inside
it
like
a
rather
large
and
sweaty
butterfly
rewrapped
in
a
cocoon
dimly
he
realized
that
he
sounded
like
every
other
nut
in
the
world
all
of
them
would
be
sure
to
tell
the
doctor
and
the
attendants
that
they
were
making
a
mistake
all
of
them
would
claim
they
were
sane
there
was
of
course
a
slight
difference
but
how
could
malone
manage
to
prove
it
the
three
men
held
him
up
now
now
blake
said
you
can
walk
malone
suppose
you
just
follow
me
to
your
room
my
room
malone
said
now
you
listen
to
me
doctor
if
you
take
this
stuff
off
me
at
once
i
promise
you
the
president
will
hear
of
it
and
i
do
know
how
he
take
interference
in
a
vital
mission
the
president
blake
asked
quietly
what
president
mr
malone
the
president
of
the
united
states
damn
it
malone
shouted
hmm
blake
said
that
was
no
good
either
malone
realized
every
nut
would
have
some
sort
of
direct
pipeline
to
the
president
or
god
or
somebody
high
up
nuts
were
like
that
but
he
was
an
fbi
agent
a
special
agent
on
a
vital
mission
he
said
so
now
now
malone
blake
told
him
let
get
to
your
room
shall
we
and
then
we
can
talk
things
over
i
can
prove
it
malone
told
him
the
three
men
picked
him
up
my
identification
is
in
my
pocket
really
blake
said
they
started
moving
down
the
long
front
hall
all
you
have
to
do
is
take
this
thing
off
so
i
can
get
at
my
pockets
malone
began
but
even
he
could
see
that
this
new
plan
was
going
to
work
either
take
it
off
blake
said
oh
certainly
malone
certainly
just
as
soon
as
we
have
you
comfortably
settled
it
was
ridiculous
malone
told
himself
as
the
men
carried
him
away
it
could
happen
an
fbi
agent
mistaken
for
a
nut
wrapped
in
a
jacket
and
carried
to
a
padded
cell
unfortunately
ridiculous
or
not
it
was
happening
and
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
do
about
it
malone
thought
with
real
longing
of
his
nice
safe
desk
in
washington
suddenly
he
discovered
in
himself
a
great
desire
to
sit
around
and
collate
reports
but
no
he
had
to
be
a
hero
he
had
to
go
and
get
himself
involved
this
he
thought
will
teach
me
a
great
lesson
the
next
time
i
get
offered
a
job
a
chimpanzee
can
do
i
start
eating
bananas
it
was
at
this
point
in
his
reflections
that
he
reached
a
small
door
blake
opened
it
and
the
three
men
carried
malone
inside
he
was
dumped
carefully
on
the
floor
then
the
door
clanged
shut
alone
malone
told
himself
bitterly
at
last
after
a
minute
or
so
had
gone
by
he
began
to
think
about
getting
out
he
could
it
occurred
to
him
scream
for
help
but
that
would
only
bring
more
attendants
and
very
possibly
blake
again
and
somehow
malone
felt
that
further
conversation
with
blake
was
not
likely
to
lead
to
any
very
rational
end
sooner
or
later
he
knew
they
would
have
to
let
him
loose
after
all
he
was
an
fbi
agent
was
he
alone
in
a
single
cheerless
cell
caught
up
in
the
toils
of
a
jacket
he
began
to
doubt
the
fact
maybe
blake
was
right
maybe
they
were
all
right
maybe
he
kenneth
malone
was
totally
mad
he
told
himself
firmly
that
the
idea
was
ridiculous
but
then
what
was
the
minutes
ticked
slowly
by
after
a
while
the
three
guards
came
back
opening
the
door
and
filing
into
the
room
carefully
malone
feeling
more
than
ever
like
something
in
a
cocoon
watched
them
with
interest
they
shut
the
door
carefully
behind
them
and
stood
before
him
now
then
one
of
them
said
we
going
to
take
the
jacket
off
if
you
promise
to
be
a
good
boy
sure
malone
said
and
when
you
take
my
clothing
look
in
the
pockets
the
pockets
to
find
my
fbi
identification
malone
said
wearily
he
only
believed
the
idea
himself
but
half
a
belief
he
told
himself
confusedly
was
better
than
no
mind
at
all
the
attendants
nodded
solemnly
sure
we
will
one
of
them
said
if
you
a
good
boy
and
do
act
up
rough
on
us
now
okay
malone
nodded
carefully
two
of
the
attendants
began
to
unbuckle
him
while
the
third
stood
by
for
reinforcements
malone
made
no
fuss
in
five
minutes
he
was
naked
as
he
told
himself
a
what
was
so
completely
nude
about
those
particular
birds
escaped
him
for
the
moment
but
it
was
important
the
three
men
were
all
holding
various
parts
of
the
or
of
his
clothing
they
were
still
watching
him
warily
look
in
the
pockets
malone
said
sure
one
said
the
man
holding
the
jacket
reached
into
it
and
dropped
it
as
if
it
were
hot
hey
he
announced
in
a
sick
voice
the
guy
carrying
a
gun
a
gun
the
second
one
asked
the
first
one
gestured
toward
the
crumpled
jacket
on
the
floor
look
for
yourself
he
said
a
real
gun
i
could
feel
it
malone
leaned
against
one
wall
looking
as
nonchalant
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
look
in
the
nude
the
room
being
cool
he
felt
he
was
succeeding
reasonably
well
try
the
other
pocket
he
suggested
the
first
attendant
gave
him
a
long
stare
what
you
got
in
there
buddy
he
asked
a
howitzer
jesus
the
second
attendant
said
without
moving
toward
the
jacket
an
armed
nut
what
a
world
try
the
pocket
malone
said
a
second
went
by
the
first
attendant
bent
down
slowly
picked
up
the
jacket
and
slipped
his
hand
into
the
other
inside
pocket
he
came
out
with
a
wallet
and
flipped
it
open
the
others
looked
over
his
shoulder
there
was
a
long
minute
of
silence
jesus
the
second
attendant
said
as
if
it
were
the
only
word
left
in
the
language
malone
sighed
there
now
he
said
you
see
suppose
you
give
me
back
my
clothes
and
let
get
down
to
brass
tacks
it
was
that
simple
of
course
first
the
attendants
had
to
go
and
get
blake
and
everybody
had
to
explain
everything
three
or
four
times
until
malone
was
just
as
sick
of
being
an
fbi
agent
as
he
had
ever
been
of
being
a
case
but
at
last
he
stood
before
blake
in
the
corridor
outside
once
again
fully
dressed
slightly
rumpled
of
course
but
fully
dressed
it
did
malone
thought
make
a
difference
and
if
clothes
exactly
make
the
man
they
were
a
long
way
from
a
hindrance
malone
blake
was
saying
i
want
to
offer
my
apologies
perfectly
okay
malone
said
agreeably
but
i
would
like
to
know
something
do
you
treat
all
your
visitors
like
this
i
mean
the
milkman
the
mailman
relatives
of
patients
it
not
often
we
get
someone
here
who
claims
to
be
from
the
fbi
blake
said
and
naturally
our
first
thought
was
that
well
sometimes
a
patient
will
come
in
just
give
himself
up
so
to
speak
his
unconscious
mind
knows
that
he
needs
help
and
so
he
comes
to
us
we
try
to
help
him
privately
malone
told
himself
that
it
was
a
hell
of
a
way
to
run
a
hospital
aloud
all
he
said
was
sure
i
understand
perfectly
doctor
blake
nodded
and
now
he
said
what
did
you
want
to
talk
to
me
about
just
a
minute
malone
closed
his
eyes
he
told
burris
he
would
check
in
and
he
was
late
have
you
got
a
phone
i
can
use
certainly
blake
said
and
led
him
down
the
corridor
to
a
small
office
malone
went
to
the
phone
at
one
end
and
began
dialing
even
before
blake
shut
the
door
and
left
him
alone
the
screen
lit
up
instantly
with
burris
face
malone
where
the
hell
have
you
been
the
head
of
the
fbi
roared
i
been
trying
to
get
in
touch
with
you
sorry
malone
said
i
was
tied
up
what
do
you
mean
tied
up
burris
said
do
you
know
i
was
just
about
to
send
out
a
general
search
order
i
thought
they
got
you
they
malone
said
interested
who
how
the
hell
would
i
know
who
burris
roared
well
nobody
got
me
malone
said
i
been
investigating
rice
pavilion
just
like
i
supposed
to
do
then
why
did
you
check
in
burris
asked
malone
sighed
because
i
got
myself
locked
up
he
said
and
explained
burris
listened
with
patience
when
malone
was
finished
burris
said
you
coming
right
on
back
but
no
arguments
burris
told
him
if
you
going
to
let
things
like
that
happen
to
you
you
better
off
here
besides
there
are
plenty
of
men
doing
the
actual
searching
there
no
need
secretly
malone
felt
relief
well
all
right
he
said
but
let
me
check
out
this
place
first
will
you
go
ahead
burris
said
but
get
right
on
back
here
malone
agreed
and
snapped
the
phone
off
then
he
turned
back
to
find
blake
examining
hospital
records
was
not
an
easy
job
the
inalienable
right
of
a
physician
to
refuse
to
disclose
confidences
respecting
a
patient
applied
even
to
idiots
imbecile
and
morons
but
malone
had
a
slight
edge
due
to
blake
embarrassment
and
he
put
it
mercilessly
to
work
for
all
the
good
it
did
him
he
might
as
well
have
stayed
in
his
cell
there
was
even
the
slightest
suspicion
in
any
record
that
any
of
the
rice
pavilion
patients
were
telepathic
are
you
sure
that
what
you
looking
for
blake
asked
him
some
hours
later
i
sure
malone
said
when
you
eliminate
the
impossible
whatever
remains
however
improbable
must
be
the
truth
oh
blake
said
after
a
second
he
added
what
does
that
mean
malone
shrugged
it
an
old
saying
he
told
the
doctor
it
have
to
mean
anything
it
just
sounds
good
oh
blake
said
again
after
a
while
malone
said
farewell
to
good
old
rice
pavilion
and
headed
back
to
washington
there
he
told
himself
everything
would
be
peaceful
and
so
it
was
peaceful
and
dispiriting
every
agent
had
problems
getting
reports
from
hospitals
and
not
even
the
fbi
could
open
the
private
files
of
a
licensed
and
registered
psychiatrist
but
the
field
agents
did
the
best
they
could
and
considering
the
circumstances
their
best
was
pretty
good
malone
meanwhile
put
in
two
weeks
sitting
glumly
at
his
washington
desk
and
checking
reports
as
they
arrived
they
were
uniformly
depressing
the
united
states
of
america
contained
more
minds
than
malone
cared
to
think
about
there
seemed
to
be
enough
of
them
to
explain
the
results
of
any
election
you
were
unhappy
over
unfortunately
subnormal
was
all
you
could
call
them
like
the
patients
at
rice
pavilion
not
one
of
them
appeared
to
possess
any
abnormal
psionic
abilities
whatever
there
were
a
couple
who
were
reputed
to
be
poltergeists
but
in
neither
case
was
there
a
single
shred
of
evidence
to
substantiate
the
claim
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
malone
was
just
about
convinced
that
his
idea
had
been
a
total
washout
he
himself
had
been
locked
up
in
a
padded
cell
and
other
agents
had
spent
a
full
fortnight
digging
up
imbeciles
while
the
spy
at
yucca
flats
had
been
going
right
on
his
merry
way
scooping
information
out
of
the
men
at
project
isle
as
though
he
were
scooping
beans
out
of
a
pot
and
very
likely
laughing
himself
silly
at
the
feeble
efforts
of
the
fbi
who
could
he
be
anyone
malone
told
himself
unhappily
anyone
at
all
he
could
be
the
janitor
who
swept
out
the
buildings
one
of
the
guards
at
the
gate
one
of
the
minor
technicians
on
another
project
or
even
some
old
prospector
wandering
around
the
desert
with
a
scintillation
counter
is
there
any
limit
to
telepathic
range
the
spy
could
even
be
sitting
quietly
in
an
armchair
in
the
kremlin
probing
through
several
thousand
miles
of
solid
earth
to
peep
into
the
brains
of
the
men
on
project
isle
that
was
to
say
the
very
least
a
depressing
idea
malone
found
he
had
to
assume
that
the
spy
was
in
the
united
states
that
in
other
words
there
was
some
effective
range
to
telepathic
communication
otherwise
there
was
no
point
in
bothering
to
continue
the
search
therefore
he
found
one
other
thing
to
do
he
alerted
every
agent
to
the
job
of
discovering
how
the
spy
was
getting
his
information
out
of
the
country
he
doubted
that
it
would
turn
up
anything
but
it
was
a
chance
and
malone
hoped
desperately
for
it
because
he
was
beginning
to
be
sure
that
the
field
agents
were
never
going
to
turn
up
any
telepathic
imbeciles
he
was
right
they
never
did
the
telephone
rang
malone
rolled
over
on
the
couch
and
muttered
four
words
under
his
breath
was
it
absolutely
necessary
for
someone
to
call
him
at
seven
in
the
morning
he
grabbed
at
the
receiver
with
one
hand
and
picked
up
his
cigar
from
the
ashtray
with
the
other
it
was
bad
enough
to
be
awakened
from
a
sound
sleep
but
when
a
man
had
been
sleeping
at
all
it
was
even
worse
he
been
sitting
up
since
before
five
that
morning
worrying
about
the
telepathic
spy
and
at
the
moment
he
wanted
sleep
more
than
he
wanted
phone
calls
gur
he
said
sleepily
and
angrily
thankful
that
he
never
had
a
visiphone
installed
in
his
apartment
a
taste
for
blondes
was
apparently
hereditary
at
any
rate
malone
felt
he
had
inherited
it
from
his
father
and
he
did
want
any
visible
strangers
calling
him
at
odd
hours
to
interfere
with
his
process
of
collection
and
research
he
blinked
at
the
audio
circuit
and
a
feminine
voice
said
kenneth
j
malone
who
this
malone
said
peevishly
beginning
to
discover
himself
capable
of
semirational
english
speech
long
distance
from
san
francisco
the
voice
said
it
certainly
is
malone
said
who
calling
san
francisco
is
calling
the
voice
said
primly
malone
repressed
a
desire
to
tell
the
voice
that
he
did
want
to
talk
to
francis
not
even
in
spanish
and
said
instead
in
san
francisco
there
was
a
momentary
hiatus
and
then
the
voice
said
thomas
boyd
is
calling
sir
he
says
this
is
a
scramble
call
malone
took
a
drag
from
his
cigar
and
closed
his
eyes
obviously
the
call
was
a
scramble
if
it
had
been
clear
the
man
would
have
dialed
direct
instead
of
going
through
what
malone
now
recognized
as
an
operator
boyd
says
he
is
the
of
the
san
francisco
office
of
the
fbi
the
voice
offered
and
quite
right
too
malone
told
her
all
right
put
him
on
one
moment
there
was
a
pause
a
click
another
pause
and
then
another
click
at
last
the
operator
said
your
party
is
ready
sir
then
there
was
still
another
pause
malone
stared
at
the
audio
receiver
he
began
to
whistle
irish
eyes
are
and
the
sound
of
irish
laughter
hello
malone
i
here
tom
malone
said
guiltily
this
is
me
what
the
trouble
trouble
boyd
said
there
is
any
trouble
well
not
really
or
maybe
it
is
i
do
know
malone
scowled
at
the
audio
receiver
and
for
the
first
time
wished
he
had
gone
ahead
and
had
a
video
circuit
put
in
so
that
boyd
could
see
the
horrendous
expression
on
his
face
look
he
said
it
seven
here
and
that
too
early
out
there
it
four
and
that
practically
ridiculous
what
so
important
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
boyd
was
calling
him
just
for
the
fun
of
it
the
man
was
a
damned
good
agent
but
why
a
call
at
this
hour
malone
muttered
under
his
breath
then
he
squashed
out
his
cigar
and
lit
a
cigarette
while
boyd
was
saying
ken
i
think
we
may
have
found
what
you
been
looking
for
it
was
safe
to
say
too
much
even
over
a
scrambled
circuit
but
malone
got
the
message
without
difficulty
yeah
he
said
sitting
up
on
the
edge
of
the
couch
you
sure
well
boyd
said
no
not
absolutely
sure
not
absolutely
but
it
is
worth
your
taking
a
personal
look
i
think
ah
malone
said
cautiously
an
imbecile
no
boyd
said
flatly
not
an
imbecile
definitely
not
an
imbecile
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
hell
of
a
fat
long
way
from
an
imbecile
malone
glanced
at
his
watch
and
skimmed
over
the
airline
timetables
in
his
mind
i
be
there
nine
your
time
he
said
have
a
car
waiting
for
me
at
the
field
as
usual
malone
managed
to
sleep
better
on
the
plane
than
he
been
able
to
do
at
home
he
slept
so
well
in
fact
that
he
was
still
groggy
when
he
stepped
into
the
waiting
car
good
to
see
you
ken
boyd
said
briskly
as
he
shook
malone
hand
you
too
tom
malone
said
sleepily
now
what
all
this
about
he
looked
around
apprehensively
no
bugs
in
this
car
i
hope
he
said
boyd
gunned
the
motor
and
headed
toward
the
san
francisco
freeway
better
not
be
he
said
or
i
fire
me
a
technician
or
two
well
then
malone
said
relaxing
against
the
upholstery
where
is
this
guy
and
who
is
he
and
how
did
you
find
him
boyd
looked
uncomfortable
it
was
somehow
both
an
and
a
slightly
risible
sight
six
feet
one
and
inches
tall
in
his
flat
feet
boyd
posted
around
over
two
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
of
bone
flesh
and
muscle
he
swung
a
of
startling
proportions
under
the
silk
shirting
he
wore
and
his
face
with
its
wide
nose
small
eyes
and
high
forehead
was
half
highly
mature
half
startlingly
childlike
in
an
apparent
effort
to
erase
those
childlike
qualities
boyd
sported
a
fringe
of
beard
and
a
moustache
which
reminded
malone
of
somebody
he
could
quite
place
but
whoever
the
somebody
was
his
hair
had
been
black
as
was
he
decided
it
did
make
any
difference
anyhow
boyd
was
speaking
in
the
first
place
he
said
it
is
a
guy
in
the
second
i
not
exactly
sure
who
it
is
and
in
the
third
ken
i
did
find
it
there
was
a
little
silence
do
tell
me
malone
said
it
a
telepathic
horse
is
it
tom
i
just
do
think
i
could
stand
a
telepathic
horse
no
boyd
said
hastily
no
not
at
all
no
horse
it
a
dame
i
mean
a
lady
he
looked
away
from
the
road
and
flashed
a
glance
at
malone
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
pleading
for
something
understanding
possibly
malone
thought
frankly
boyd
said
i
rather
not
tell
you
anything
about
her
just
yet
i
rather
you
met
her
first
then
you
could
make
up
your
own
mind
all
right
all
right
malone
said
wearily
do
it
your
own
way
how
far
do
we
have
to
go
just
about
an
hour
drive
boyd
said
that
all
malone
slumped
back
in
the
seat
and
pushed
his
hat
over
his
eyes
fine
he
said
suppose
you
wake
me
up
when
we
get
there
but
groggy
as
he
was
he
could
sleep
he
wished
he
had
some
coffee
on
the
plane
maybe
it
would
have
made
him
feel
better
then
again
coffee
was
only
coffee
true
he
had
never
acquired
his
father
taste
for
gin
and
imagined
therefore
that
it
hereditary
like
a
taste
for
blondes
but
there
was
always
bourbon
he
thought
about
bourbon
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
a
nice
thought
it
warmed
him
and
made
him
feel
a
lot
better
after
a
while
he
even
felt
awake
enough
to
do
some
talking
he
pushed
his
hat
back
and
struggled
to
a
reasonable
sitting
position
i
do
suppose
you
have
a
drink
hidden
away
in
the
car
somewhere
he
said
tentatively
or
would
the
technicians
have
found
that
too
better
not
have
boyd
said
in
the
same
tone
as
before
or
i
fire
a
couple
of
technicians
he
grinned
without
turning
it
in
the
door
compartment
next
to
the
cartridges
and
the
gun
malone
opened
the
compartment
in
the
thick
door
of
the
car
and
extracted
a
bottle
it
was
christian
brothers
brandy
instead
of
the
bourbon
he
had
been
thinking
about
but
he
discovered
that
he
mind
at
all
it
went
down
as
smoothly
as
milk
boyd
glanced
at
it
momentarily
as
malone
screwed
the
top
back
on
no
malone
said
in
answer
to
the
unspoken
question
driving
then
he
settled
back
again
and
tipped
his
hat
forward
he
did
sleep
a
wink
he
was
perfectly
sure
of
that
but
it
over
two
seconds
later
that
boyd
said
we
here
ken
wake
up
whadyamean
wakeup
malone
said
i
was
asleep
he
thumbed
his
hat
back
and
sat
up
rapidly
where
bayview
neuropsychiatric
hospital
boyd
said
this
is
where
harman
works
you
know
no
malone
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
know
you
did
tell
me
remember
and
who
is
harman
anyhow
the
car
was
moving
up
a
long
curving
driveway
toward
a
large
surrounded
building
boyd
spoke
without
looking
away
from
the
road
well
he
said
this
wilson
harman
is
the
man
who
phoned
us
yesterday
one
of
my
field
agents
was
out
here
asking
around
about
imbeciles
and
so
on
found
nothing
by
the
way
and
then
this
harman
called
later
said
he
had
someone
here
i
might
be
interested
in
so
i
came
on
out
myself
for
a
look
yesterday
afternoon
after
all
we
had
instructions
to
follow
up
every
possible
lead
i
know
malone
said
i
wrote
them
oh
boyd
said
sure
well
anyhow
i
talked
to
this
dame
lady
and
and
i
talked
to
her
boyd
said
i
not
entirely
sure
of
anything
myself
but
well
hell
you
take
a
look
at
her
he
pulled
the
car
up
to
a
parking
space
slid
nonchalantly
into
a
slot
marked
director
and
slid
out
from
under
the
wheel
while
malone
got
out
the
other
side
they
marched
up
the
broad
steps
through
the
doorway
and
into
the
office
of
the
receptionist
boyd
showed
her
his
little
golden
badge
and
got
an
appropriate
gasp
fbi
he
said
harman
expecting
us
the
wait
was
over
fifteen
seconds
boyd
and
malone
marched
down
the
hall
and
around
a
couple
of
corners
and
came
to
the
doctor
office
the
door
was
opaqued
glass
with
nothing
but
a
room
number
stenciled
on
it
without
ceremony
boyd
pushed
the
door
open
malone
followed
him
inside
the
office
was
small
but
sunny
wilson
harman
sat
behind
a
wood
desk
a
little
man
with
blond
hair
and
rimless
eyeglasses
who
looked
about
and
could
possibly
malone
thought
have
been
anywhere
near
that
young
on
a
second
look
malone
noticed
a
better
age
indication
in
the
eyes
and
forehead
and
revised
his
first
guess
upward
between
ten
and
fifteen
years
come
in
gentlemen
harman
called
his
voice
was
that
rarity
a
really
loud
high
tenor
harman
boyd
said
this
is
my
superior
malone
we
like
to
have
a
talk
with
miss
thompson
if
we
might
i
anticipated
that
sir
harman
said
miss
thompson
is
in
the
next
room
have
you
explained
to
malone
that
i
have
explained
a
thing
boyd
said
quickly
and
added
in
what
was
obviously
intended
to
be
a
casual
tone
malone
wants
to
get
a
picture
of
miss
thompson
directly
without
any
preconceptions
i
see
harman
said
very
well
gentlemen
through
this
door
he
opened
the
door
in
the
wall
of
the
room
and
malone
took
one
look
it
was
a
long
long
look
standing
framed
in
the
doorway
dressed
in
the
starched
white
of
a
nurse
uniform
was
the
most
beautiful
blonde
he
had
ever
seen
she
had
curves
she
definitely
had
curves
as
a
matter
of
fact
malone
did
really
think
he
had
ever
seen
curves
before
these
were
something
new
and
different
and
truly
but
it
the
curves
or
the
long
straight
lines
of
her
legs
or
the
quiet
beauty
of
her
face
that
made
her
so
special
after
all
malone
had
seen
legs
and
bodies
and
faces
before
at
least
he
thought
he
had
offhand
he
could
remember
where
looking
at
the
girl
malone
was
ready
to
write
definitions
for
every
anatomical
term
even
a
term
like
hands
malone
had
never
seen
anything
especially
arousing
in
the
human
hand
before
anyway
not
when
the
hand
was
just
lying
around
so
to
speak
attached
to
its
wrist
but
not
doing
anything
in
particular
but
these
hands
long
slender
and
tapering
white
and
and
yet
it
was
just
the
sheer
physical
beauty
of
the
girl
she
had
something
else
something
more
and
something
different
something
malone
thought
in
a
semidelirious
haze
something
blue
personality
character
soul
whatever
it
was
malone
decided
this
girl
had
it
she
had
enough
of
it
to
supply
the
entire
human
race
and
any
others
that
might
exist
in
the
universe
malone
smiled
at
the
girl
and
she
smiled
back
after
seeing
the
smile
malone
was
sure
he
could
still
walk
evenly
somehow
though
he
managed
to
go
over
to
her
and
extend
his
hand
the
notion
that
a
telepath
would
turn
out
to
be
this
epitome
had
never
crossed
his
mind
but
now
somehow
it
seemed
perfectly
fitting
and
proper
good
morning
miss
thompson
he
said
in
what
he
hoped
was
a
winning
voice
the
smile
disappeared
it
was
like
the
sun
going
out
the
vision
appeared
to
be
troubled
malone
was
about
to
volunteer
his
help
if
necessary
for
the
next
seventy
years
when
she
spoke
i
not
miss
thompson
she
said
this
is
one
of
our
nurses
harman
put
in
miss
wilson
malone
and
boyd
miss
thompson
gentlemen
is
over
there
malone
turned
there
in
a
corner
of
the
room
an
old
lady
sat
she
was
a
small
old
lady
with
cheeks
and
twinkling
eyes
she
held
some
knitting
in
her
hands
and
she
smiled
up
at
the
fbi
men
as
if
they
were
her
grandsons
come
for
tea
and
cookies
of
a
sunday
afternoon
she
had
hair
that
shone
like
a
crown
around
her
old
head
in
the
lights
of
the
room
malone
blinked
at
her
she
did
disappear
you
miss
thompson
he
said
she
smiled
sweetly
oh
my
no
she
said
there
was
a
long
silence
malone
looked
at
her
then
he
looked
at
the
unbelievably
beautiful
miss
wilson
then
he
looked
at
harman
and
at
last
he
looked
at
boyd
all
right
he
said
i
get
it
miss
thompson
now
wait
a
minute
malone
boyd
began
wait
a
minute
malone
said
there
are
four
people
here
not
counting
me
i
know
i
not
miss
thompson
i
never
was
not
even
as
a
child
and
harman
is
and
miss
wilson
is
and
is
either
so
you
must
be
unless
she
here
or
unless
she
invisible
or
unless
i
crazy
it
is
malone
boyd
said
what
is
me
that
crazy
boyd
said
okay
malone
said
i
not
crazy
then
will
somebody
please
tell
me
the
little
old
lady
cleared
her
throat
a
silence
fell
when
it
was
complete
she
spoke
and
her
voice
was
as
sweet
and
kindly
as
anything
malone
had
ever
heard
you
may
call
me
miss
thompson
she
said
for
the
present
at
any
rate
they
all
do
here
it
a
pseudonym
i
have
to
use
a
pseudonym
malone
said
you
see
malone
miss
wilson
began
malone
stopped
her
do
talk
he
said
i
have
to
concentrate
and
if
you
talk
i
can
barely
think
he
took
off
his
hat
suddenly
and
began
twisting
the
brim
in
his
hands
you
understand
do
you
the
trace
of
a
smile
appeared
on
her
face
i
think
i
do
she
said
now
malone
said
you
miss
thompson
but
not
really
because
you
have
to
use
a
pseudonym
he
blinked
at
the
little
old
lady
why
well
she
said
otherwise
people
would
find
out
about
my
little
secret
your
little
secret
malone
said
that
right
the
little
old
lady
said
i
immortal
you
see
malone
said
oh
then
he
kept
quiet
for
a
long
time
it
did
seem
to
him
that
anyone
in
the
room
was
breathing
he
said
oh
again
but
it
did
sound
any
better
than
it
had
the
first
time
he
tried
another
phrase
you
immortal
he
said
that
right
the
little
old
lady
agreed
sweetly
there
was
only
one
other
question
to
ask
and
malone
set
his
teeth
grimly
and
asked
it
it
came
out
just
a
trifle
indistinct
but
the
little
old
lady
nodded
my
real
name
she
said
elizabeth
elizabeth
tudor
of
course
i
used
to
be
queen
of
england
malone
said
faintly
malone
look
boyd
began
let
me
get
it
all
at
once
malone
told
him
i
strong
i
can
take
it
he
twisted
his
hat
again
and
turned
back
to
the
little
old
lady
you
immortal
and
you
not
really
miss
thompson
but
queen
elizabeth
i
he
said
slowly
that
right
she
said
how
clever
of
you
of
course
after
little
jimmy
cousin
mary
boy
i
mean
said
i
was
dead
and
claimed
the
throne
i
decided
to
change
my
name
and
all
and
that
what
i
did
but
i
am
elizabeth
regina
she
smiled
and
her
eyes
twinkled
merrily
malone
stared
at
her
for
a
long
minute
he
thought
going
to
love
oh
i
so
glad
the
little
old
lady
said
do
your
really
think
he
will
because
i
sure
i
like
your
burris
too
all
of
you
fbi
men
are
so
charming
just
like
poor
poor
essex
well
malone
told
himself
that
was
that
he
found
himself
a
telepath
and
she
was
an
imbecile
oh
no
that
would
have
been
simple
instead
she
was
battier
than
a
cathedral
spire
the
long
silence
was
broken
by
the
voice
of
miss
wilson
malone
she
said
you
been
thinking
she
stopped
i
mean
you
been
so
quiet
i
like
being
quiet
malone
said
patiently
besides
he
stopped
and
turned
to
the
little
old
lady
you
really
read
my
mind
he
thought
deliberately
after
a
second
he
added
majesty
how
sweet
of
you
malone
she
said
nobody
called
me
that
for
centuries
but
of
course
i
can
although
it
not
reading
really
after
all
that
would
be
like
asking
if
i
can
read
your
voice
of
course
i
can
mr
malone
that
does
it
malone
said
i
not
a
hard
man
to
convince
and
when
i
see
the
truth
i
the
first
one
to
admit
it
even
if
it
makes
me
look
like
a
nut
he
turned
back
to
the
little
old
lady
begging
your
pardon
he
said
oh
my
the
little
old
lady
said
i
really
do
mind
at
all
sticks
and
stones
you
know
can
break
my
bones
but
being
called
nuts
malone
can
never
hurt
me
after
all
it
been
so
many
years
so
many
hundreds
of
years
sure
malone
said
easily
boyd
broke
in
listen
malone
he
said
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
the
hell
is
going
on
it
very
simple
malone
said
miss
thompson
here
pardon
me
i
mean
queen
elizabeth
i
really
is
a
telepath
that
all
i
think
i
want
to
lie
down
somewhere
until
it
goes
away
until
what
goes
away
miss
wilson
said
malone
stared
at
her
almost
without
seeing
her
if
not
quite
everything
he
said
he
closed
his
eyes
my
goodness
the
little
old
lady
said
after
a
second
so
confused
poor
malone
is
terribly
shaken
up
by
everything
she
stood
up
still
holding
her
knitting
and
went
across
the
room
before
the
astonished
eyes
of
the
doctor
and
nurse
and
tom
boyd
she
patted
the
fbi
agent
on
the
shoulder
there
there
malone
she
said
it
will
all
be
perfectly
all
right
you
see
then
she
returned
to
her
seat
malone
opened
his
eyes
my
god
he
said
he
closed
them
again
but
they
flew
open
as
if
of
their
own
accord
he
turned
to
harman
you
called
up
boyd
here
he
said
and
told
him
that
er
miss
thompson
was
a
telepath
how
you
know
it
all
right
the
little
old
lady
put
in
from
her
chair
i
mind
your
calling
me
miss
thompson
not
right
now
anyhow
thanks
malone
said
faintly
harman
was
blinking
in
a
kind
of
befuddled
astonishment
you
mean
she
really
a
he
stopped
and
brought
his
tenor
voice
to
a
squeaking
halt
regained
his
professional
poise
and
began
again
rather
not
discuss
the
patient
in
her
presence
malone
he
said
if
you
just
come
into
my
office
oh
harman
the
little
old
lady
said
primly
i
do
wish
you
give
your
own
queen
credit
for
some
ability
goodness
knows
you
think
smart
enough
now
now
miss
thompson
he
said
in
what
was
obviously
his
best
grade
a
choice
government
inspected
couchside
manner
do
upset
yourself
she
finished
for
him
now
really
doctor
i
know
what
you
going
to
tell
them
but
miss
thompson
i
you
did
honestly
think
i
a
telepath
the
little
old
lady
said
heavens
we
know
that
and
you
going
to
tell
them
how
i
used
to
say
i
could
read
minds
oh
years
and
years
ago
and
because
of
that
you
thought
it
might
be
worthwhile
to
tell
the
fbi
about
me
which
was
very
kind
of
you
doctor
before
you
know
anything
about
why
they
wanted
somebody
like
me
now
now
miss
thompson
miss
wilson
said
walking
across
the
room
to
put
an
arm
around
the
little
old
lady
shoulder
malone
wished
for
one
brief
second
that
he
were
the
little
old
lady
maybe
if
he
were
a
patient
in
the
hospital
he
would
get
the
same
treatment
he
wondered
if
he
could
possibly
work
such
a
deal
then
he
wondered
if
it
would
be
worthwhile
being
nuts
but
of
course
it
would
he
was
nuts
anyhow
was
he
sure
he
told
himself
they
were
all
nuts
nobody
going
to
hurt
you
miss
wilson
said
she
was
talking
to
the
old
lady
you
be
perfectly
all
right
and
you
do
have
to
worry
about
a
thing
oh
yes
dear
i
know
that
the
little
old
lady
said
you
only
want
to
help
me
dear
you
so
kind
and
these
fbi
men
really
do
mean
any
harm
but
doctor
harman
did
know
that
he
just
thinks
i
crazy
and
that
all
please
miss
thompson
harman
began
just
crazy
that
all
the
little
old
lady
said
she
turned
away
for
a
second
and
nobody
said
anything
then
she
turned
back
do
you
all
know
what
he
thinking
now
she
said
harman
turned
a
dull
purple
but
she
ignored
him
wondering
why
i
did
take
the
trouble
to
prove
all
this
to
you
years
ago
and
besides
that
he
thinking
about
miss
thompson
harman
said
his
bedside
manner
had
cracked
through
and
his
voice
was
harsh
and
strained
please
oh
all
right
she
said
a
little
petulantly
if
you
want
to
keep
all
that
private
malone
broke
in
suddenly
fascinated
why
did
you
prove
you
were
telepathic
before
now
he
said
the
little
old
lady
smiled
at
him
why
because
you
would
have
believed
me
she
said
she
dropped
her
knitting
neatly
in
her
lap
and
folded
her
hands
over
it
none
of
you
to
believe
me
she
said
and
sniffed
miss
wilson
moved
nervously
and
she
looked
up
and
do
tell
me
it
going
to
be
all
right
i
know
it
going
to
be
all
right
i
going
to
make
sure
of
that
malone
felt
a
sudden
chill
but
it
was
obvious
he
told
himself
that
the
little
old
lady
did
mean
what
she
was
saying
she
smiled
at
him
again
and
her
smile
was
as
sweet
and
guileless
as
the
smile
on
the
face
of
his
very
own
sainted
grandmother
not
that
malone
remembered
his
grandmother
she
had
died
before
been
born
but
if
he
had
a
grandmother
and
if
he
remembered
her
he
was
sure
she
would
have
had
the
same
sweet
smile
so
she
could
have
meant
what
she
said
would
malone
own
grandmother
make
things
difficult
for
him
the
very
idea
was
ridiculous
harman
opened
his
mouth
apparently
changed
his
mind
and
shut
it
again
the
little
old
lady
turned
to
him
were
you
going
to
ask
why
i
bothered
to
prove
anything
to
mr
malone
she
said
of
course
you
were
and
i
shall
tell
you
because
malone
wanted
to
believe
me
he
wants
me
he
needs
me
a
telepath
and
that
enough
for
malone
is
it
gur
malone
said
taken
by
surprise
after
a
second
he
added
i
guess
so
you
see
doctor
the
little
old
lady
said
but
you
harman
began
i
read
minds
the
little
old
lady
said
that
right
doctor
that
what
makes
me
a
telepath
malone
brain
was
whirling
rapidly
like
a
distant
galaxy
telepath
was
a
nice
word
he
thought
how
do
you
telepath
from
a
road
simple
the
road
is
paved
malone
thought
that
was
pretty
funny
but
he
did
laugh
he
thought
he
would
never
laugh
again
he
wanted
to
cry
a
little
but
he
think
he
be
able
to
manage
that
either
he
twisted
his
hat
but
it
did
make
him
feel
any
better
gradually
he
became
aware
that
the
little
old
lady
was
talking
to
harman
again
but
she
said
since
it
will
make
you
feel
so
much
better
doctor
we
give
you
our
royal
permission
to
retire
and
to
speak
to
malone
alone
malone
alone
harman
muttered
hmm
my
well
he
turned
and
seemed
to
be
surprised
that
malone
was
actually
standing
near
him
yes
he
said
well
alone
malone
please
whoever
you
are
just
come
into
my
office
please
malone
looked
at
the
little
old
lady
one
of
her
eyes
closed
and
opened
it
was
an
unmistakable
wink
malone
grinned
at
her
in
what
he
hoped
was
a
cheerful
manner
all
right
he
said
to
the
psychiatrist
let
go
he
turned
with
the
barest
trace
of
regret
and
boyd
followed
him
leaving
the
little
old
lady
and
unfortunately
the
startling
miss
wilson
behind
the
procession
filed
back
into
harman
office
the
doctor
closed
the
door
and
leaned
against
it
for
a
second
he
looked
as
though
someone
had
suddenly
revealed
to
him
that
the
world
was
square
but
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
almost
even
sit
down
gentlemen
he
said
and
indicated
chairs
i
really
well
i
do
know
what
to
say
all
this
time
all
these
years
she
been
reading
my
mind
my
mind
she
been
reading
looking
right
into
my
mind
or
whatever
it
is
whatever
what
is
malone
asked
sincerely
interested
he
had
dropped
gratefully
into
a
chair
near
boyd
across
the
desk
from
harman
whatever
my
is
harmon
said
reading
it
oh
my
harman
malone
began
but
the
psychiatrist
gave
him
a
bright
blank
stare
do
you
understand
he
said
she
a
telepath
we
the
phone
on
harman
desk
chimed
gently
he
glanced
at
it
and
said
excuse
me
the
phone
he
picked
up
the
receiver
and
said
hello

no
image
on
the
screen
but
the
voice
was
image
enough

the
voice
said
i
just
want

know
if
he
all
tucked
in
tucked
in
harman
gave
the
phone
a
sudden
smile
a
joke
he
said
it
is
a
joke
is
it
the
way
things
have
been
happening
you
never
know
whether
a
joke
burris
voice
said
that
right
yes
am
i
talking
to
one
of
the
patients
harman
gulped
got
mad
and
thought
better
of
it
at
last
he
said
very
gently
i
not
at
all
sure
and
handed
the
phone
to
malone
the
fbi
agent
said
hello
chief
things
are
a
little
confused
burris
face
appeared
on
the
screen
confused
sure
he
said
i
feel
confused
already
he
took
a
breath
i
called
the
san
francisco
office
and
they
told
me
you
and
boyd
were
out
there
what
going
on
malone
said
cautiously
we
found
a
telepath
burris
eyes
widened
slightly
another
one
what
are
you
talking
about
another
one
malone
said
we
have
one
does
anybody
else
have
any
more
well
burris
said
we
just
got
a
report
on
another
one
maybe
besides
yours
i
mean
i
hope
the
one
you
got
is
in
better
shape
than
the
one
i
got
malone
said
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
then
spat
it
all
out
at
once
the
one
we
found
is
a
little
old
lady
she
thinks
she
queen
elizabeth
i
she
a
telepath
sure
but
she
nuts
queen
elizabeth
burris
said
of
england
that
right
malone
said
he
held
his
breath
damn
it
burris
exploded
they
already
got
one
malone
sighed
this
is
another
one
he
said
or
rather
the
original
one
she
also
claims
she
immortal
lives
forever
burris
said
you
mean
like
that
immortal
malone
said
right
burris
nodded
then
he
looked
worried
tell
me
malone
he
said
she
is
she
is
immortal
you
mean
malone
said
burris
nodded
malone
said
confidently
of
course
not
there
was
a
little
pause
malone
thought
things
over
hell
maybe
she
was
immortal
stranger
things
had
happened
they
he
looked
over
at
harman
how
about
that
he
said
could
she
be
immortal
the
psychiatrist
shook
his
head
decisively
she
been
here
for
over
forty
years
malone
ever
since
her
late
teens
her
records
show
all
that
and
her
birth
certificate
is
in
perfect
order
not
a
chance
malone
sighed
and
turned
back
to
the
phone
of
course
she
immortal
chief
he
said
she
could
be
nobody
is
just
a
nut
i
was
afraid
of
that
burris
said
afraid
malone
said
burris
nodded
we
got
another
one
or
anyhow
we
think
we
have
he
said
if
he
checks
out
that
is
right
here
in
washington
not
at
rice
pavilion
malone
asked
no
burris
said
absently
st
elizabeths
malone
sighed
another
nut
case
burris
said
delusions
of
persecution
they
tell
me
and
paranoia
and
a
whole
lot
of
other
things
that
sound
nasty
as
hell
i
ca
pronounce
any
of
them
and
that
always
a
bad
sign
can
he
talk
malone
said
who
knows
burris
told
him
and
shrugged
i
sending
him
on
out
to
yucca
flats
anyhow
under
guard
you
might
find
a
use
for
him
oh
sure
malone
said
we
can
use
him
as
a
horrible
example
suppose
he
ca
talk
or
do
anything
suppose
he
turns
violent
suppose
we
ca
afford
to
overlook
a
thing
burris
said
looking
stern
once
again
malone
sighed
deeply
i
know
he
said
but
all
the
same
do
worry
about
a
thing
malone
burris
said
with
a
palpably
false
air
of
confidence
everything
is
going
to
be
perfectly
all
right
he
looked
like
a
man
trying
very
hard
to
sell
the
brooklyn
bridge
to
a
born
new
yorker
you
get
this
queen
elizabeth
of
yours
out
of
there
and
take
her
to
yucca
flats
too
he
added
malone
considered
the
possibilities
that
were
opening
up
maybe
after
all
they
were
going
to
find
more
telepaths
and
maybe
all
the
telepaths
would
be
nuts
when
he
thought
about
it
that
did
seem
at
all
unlikely
he
imagined
himself
with
a
talent
nobody
would
believe
he
had
a
thing
like
that
he
told
himself
glumly
could
drive
you
buggy
in
short
order
and
then
where
were
you
in
a
loony
bin
that
where
you
were
or
possibly
in
yucca
flats
malone
pictured
the
scene
there
they
would
be
just
one
big
happy
family
kenneth
malone
and
a
convention
of
bats
straight
out
of
the
nation
foremost
loony
bins
fun
malone
began
to
wonder
why
he
had
gone
into
fbi
work
in
the
first
place
listen
chief
he
said
i
sure
i
understand
burris
said
quickly
she
batty
and
this
new
one
is
batty
too
but
what
else
can
we
do
malone
do
do
anything
you
regret
regret
malone
said
like
what
i
mean
do
resign
chief
how
did
you
know
you
not
telepathic
too
are
you
of
course
not
burris
said
but
that
what
i
do
in
your
place
well
remember
malone
burris
said
his
face
took
on
a
stern
stuffed
expression
do
not
ask
what
your
country
can
do
for
you
he
quoted
the
youngest
living
ask
rather
what
you
can
do
for
your
country
sure
malone
said
sadly
well
it
true
is
it
burris
asked
what
if
it
is
malone
said
it
still
terrible
everything
is
terrible
look
at
the
situation
i
am
looking
burris
said
and
it
another
new
frontier
just
like
it
was
when
president
kennedy
first
said
those
words
a
new
frontier
inhabited
entirely
by
maniacs
malone
said
perfectly
wonderful
what
a
way
to
run
a
world
that
burris
said
is
the
way
the
ball
bounces
or
whatever
supposed
to
say
malone
do
think
you
have
got
my
sympathy
you
have
i
know
how
hard
the
job
is
you
doing
you
could
malone
told
him
bitterly
well
anyhow
burris
went
on
do
resign
stay
on
the
job
give
it
up
malone
do
desert
the
ship
i
want
you
to
promise
me
you
wo
do
it
look
chief
malone
said
these
nuts
malone
you
done
a
wonderful
job
so
far
burris
said
you
get
a
raise
and
a
better
job
when
all
this
is
over
who
else
would
have
thought
of
looking
in
the
for
telepaths
but
you
did
malone
and
i
proud
of
you
and
you
stuck
with
it
we
got
to
use
them
now
we
have
to
find
that
spy
he
took
a
breath
on
to
yucca
flats
he
said
malone
gave
up
yes
sir
he
said
anything
else
not
right
now
burris
said
if
there
is
i
let
you
know
malone
hung
up
unhappily
as
the
image
vanished
he
looked
across
at
harman
well
he
said
that
that
what
do
i
have
to
do
to
get
a
release
for
miss
thompson
harman
stared
at
him
but
malone
he
said
that
just
possible
really
miss
thompson
is
a
ward
of
the
state
and
we
could
possibly
allow
her
release
without
a
court
order
malone
thought
that
over
okay
he
said
at
last
i
can
see
that
he
turned
to
boyd
here
a
job
for
you
tom
he
said
get
one
of
the
judges
on
the
phone
you
know
which
one
will
do
us
the
most
good
fastest
mmm
boyd
said
say
judge
dunning
he
said
good
man
fast
worker
i
do
care
who
malone
said
just
get
going
and
get
us
a
release
for
miss
thompson
he
turned
back
to
the
doctor
by
the
way
he
said
has
she
got
any
other
name
besides
elizabeth
tudor
i
mean
he
added
hurriedly
her
full
name
harman
said
is
rose
walker
thompson
she
is
not
queen
elizabeth
i
ii
or
xxviii
and
she
is
not
immortal
but
she
is
malone
pointed
out
a
telepath
and
that
why
i
want
her
she
may
harman
said
be
a
telepath
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
partly
managed
to
forget
the
disturbing
incidents
that
had
happened
a
few
minutes
before
i
do
even
want
to
discuss
that
part
of
it
okay
never
mind
it
malone
said
agreeably
tom
get
us
a
court
order
for
rose
walker
thompson
effective
yesterday
day
before
if
possible
boyd
nodded
but
before
he
could
get
to
the
phone
harman
spoke
again
now
wait
a
moment
gentlemen
he
said
court
order
or
no
court
order
miss
thompson
is
definitely
not
a
well
woman
and
i
ca
see
my
way
clear
to
i
not
well
myself
malone
said
i
need
sleep
and
i
probably
have
a
cold
but
i
got
to
work
for
the
national
security
and
this
is
important
boyd
put
in
i
do
dispute
that
harman
said
nevertheless
i
the
door
that
led
into
the
other
room
burst
suddenly
open
the
three
men
turned
to
stare
at
miss
wilson
who
stood
in
the
doorway
for
a
long
second
and
then
stepped
into
the
office
closing
the
door
quietly
behind
her
i
sorry
to
interrupt
she
said
not
at
all
malone
said
it
a
pleasure
to
have
you
come
again
soon
he
smiled
at
her
she
did
smile
back
doctor
she
said
you
really
better
talk
to
miss
thompson
i
not
at
all
sure
what
i
can
do
it
something
new
new
he
said
the
worry
lines
on
his
face
were
increasing
but
he
spoke
softly
the
poor
dear
thinks
she
going
to
get
out
of
the
hospital
now
miss
wilson
said
for
some
reason
she
convinced
that
the
fbi
is
going
to
get
her
released
and
as
she
saw
the
expression
on
three
faces
she
stopped
what
wrong
she
said
miss
wilson
malone
said
we
may
i
call
you
by
your
first
name
of
course
malone
she
said
there
was
a
little
silence
miss
wilson
malone
said
what
your
first
name
she
smiled
now
very
gently
malone
wanted
to
walk
through
mountains
or
climb
fire
he
felt
confused
but
wonderful
barbara
she
said
lovely
he
said
well
barbara
and
please
call
me
ken
it
short
for
kenneth
the
smile
on
her
face
broadened
i
thought
it
might
be
she
said
well
malone
said
softly
it
is
kenneth
that
my
name
and
you
barbara
boyd
cleared
his
throat
ah
malone
said
yes
of
course
well
barbara
well
that
just
what
we
intend
to
do
take
miss
thompson
away
we
need
her
badly
harman
had
said
nothing
at
all
and
had
barely
moved
he
was
staring
at
a
point
on
his
desk
she
could
possibly
have
heard
us
he
muttered
that
a
soundproof
door
she
could
have
heard
us
but
you
ca
take
miss
thompson
away
miss
wilson
said
we
have
to
barbara
malone
said
gently
try
to
understand
for
the
national
security
she
heard
us
thinking
harman
muttered
that
what
she
heard
us
thinking
behind
a
soundproof
door
she
can
see
inside
their
minds
she
can
even
see
inside
mind
she
a
sick
woman
barbara
said
but
you
have
to
understand
vital
necessity
boyd
put
in
absolutely
vital
nevertheless
barbara
said
she
can
read
minds
harman
whispered
in
an
awed
tone
she
knows
everything
she
it
out
of
the
question
barbara
said
whether
you
like
it
or
not
miss
thompson
is
not
going
to
leave
this
hospital
why
what
could
she
do
outside
these
walls
she
has
left
in
over
forty
years
and
furthermore
malone
kenneth
malone
put
in
as
the
door
opened
again
i
mean
ken
the
little
old
lady
put
her
haloed
head
into
the
room
now
now
barbara
she
said
do
you
go
spoiling
things
just
let
these
nice
men
take
me
away
and
everything
will
be
fine
believe
me
besides
i
been
outside
more
often
then
you
imagine
outside
barbara
said
of
course
the
little
old
lady
said
in
other
people
minds
even
yours
i
remember
that
nice
young
man
what
was
his
name
never
mind
his
name
barbara
said
flushing
furiously
malone
felt
instantly
jealous
of
every
nice
young
man
he
had
ever
even
heard
of
was
a
nice
young
man
he
was
an
fbi
agent
and
he
liked
to
get
drunk
and
smoke
cigars
and
carouse
with
loose
women
anyway
reasonably
loose
women
all
nice
young
men
he
decided
should
be
turned
into
ugly
old
men
as
soon
as
possible
that
fix
them
he
noticed
the
little
old
lady
smiling
at
him
and
tried
to
change
his
thoughts
rapidly
but
the
little
old
lady
said
nothing
at
all
at
any
rate
barbara
said
i
afraid
that
we
just
ca
harman
cleared
his
throat
imperiously
it
was
a
most
impressive
noise
and
everyone
turned
to
look
at
him
his
face
was
a
little
gray
but
he
looked
otherwise
like
a
rather
pudgy
blond
roman
emperor
just
a
moment
he
said
with
dignity
i
think
you
doing
the
united
states
of
america
a
grave
injustice
miss
wilson
and
that
you
doing
an
injustice
to
miss
thompson
too
what
do
you
mean
she
said
i
think
it
would
be
nice
for
her
to
get
away
from
me
i
mean
from
here
the
psychiatrist
said
where
did
you
say
you
were
taking
her
he
asked
malone
yucca
flats
malone
said
ah
the
news
seemed
to
please
the
psychiatrist
that
a
long
distance
from
here
is
it
it
quite
a
few
hundred
miles
away
perhaps
even
a
few
thousand
miles
away
i
feel
sure
that
will
be
the
best
thing
for
me
i
mean
of
course
for
miss
thompson
i
shall
recommend
that
the
court
so
order
doctor
but
even
barbara
saw
malone
could
tell
that
it
was
no
good
arguing
with
harman
she
tried
a
last
attack
doctor
going
to
take
care
of
her
a
light
the
size
and
shape
of
north
america
burst
in
malone
mind
he
almost
chortled
but
he
managed
to
keep
his
voice
under
control
what
she
needs
he
said
is
a
trained
psychiatric
nurse
barbara
wilson
gave
him
a
look
that
had
carloads
of
stacked
away
in
it
but
malone
barely
minded
she
get
over
it
he
told
himself
now
was
that
sweet
of
you
to
think
of
that
the
little
old
lady
said
malone
looked
at
her
and
was
rewarded
with
another
wink
he
thought
reads
minds
i
certainly
glad
you
thought
of
barbara
the
little
old
lady
went
on
you
will
go
with
me
wo
you
dear
i
make
you
a
duchess
would
you
like
to
be
a
duchess
dear
barbara
looked
from
malone
to
the
little
old
lady
and
then
she
looked
at
harman
apparently
what
she
saw
failed
to
make
her
happy
we
take
good
care
of
her
barbara
malone
said
she
did
even
bother
to
give
him
an
answer
after
a
second
boyd
said
well
i
guess
that
settles
it
if
you
let
me
use
your
phone
harman
i
call
judge
dunning
go
right
ahead
harman
said
go
right
ahead
the
little
old
lady
smiled
softly
without
looking
at
anybody
at
all
wo
it
be
wonderful
she
whispered
at
last
i
been
recognized
my
country
is
about
to
pay
me
for
my
services
my
loyal
subjects
she
stopped
and
wiped
what
malone
thought
was
a
tear
from
one
eye
now
now
miss
thompson
barbara
said
i
not
sad
the
little
old
lady
said
smiling
up
at
her
i
just
so
very
happy
i
am
about
to
get
my
reward
my
reward
at
last
from
all
of
my
loyal
subjects
you
see
she
paused
and
malone
felt
a
faint
stirring
of
stark
chill
fear
wo
it
be
wonderful
said
the
little
old
lady
you
andrew
burris
said
malone
looked
at
the
surprised
face
on
the
screen
and
wished
he
called
he
had
to
report
in
of
course
but
if
he
had
any
sense
he
have
ordered
boyd
to
do
the
job
for
him
oh
well
it
was
too
late
for
that
now
i
in
las
vegas
he
said
i
tried
to
get
you
last
night
but
i
could
so
i
las
vegas
burris
said
well
well
las
vegas
his
face
darkened
and
his
voice
became
very
loud
why
are
you
in
yucca
flats
he
screamed
because
she
insisted
on
it
malone
said
the
old
lady
miss
thompson
she
says
there
another
telepath
here
burris
closed
his
eyes
well
that
a
relief
he
said
at
last
somebody
in
one
of
the
gambling
houses
i
suppose
fine
malone
he
went
right
on
without
a
pause
the
boys
have
uncovered
two
more
in
various
parts
of
the
nation
not
one
of
them
is
even
close
to
sane
he
opened
his
eyes
where
this
one
he
said
malone
sighed
in
the
looney
bin
he
said
burris
eyes
closed
again
malone
waited
in
silence
at
last
burris
said
all
right
get
him
out
right
malone
said
tell
me
burris
said
why
did
miss
thompson
insist
that
you
go
to
las
vegas
somebody
else
could
have
done
the
job
you
could
have
sent
boyd
could
you
chief
malone
said
slowly
what
sort
of
mental
condition
are
those
other
telepaths
in
pretty
bad
burris
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
very
bad
miss
thompson
may
be
off
her
trolley
but
the
others
have
even
got
any
tracks
he
paused
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
he
said
well
malone
said
i
figured
we
better
handle
miss
thompson
with
kid
gloves
at
least
until
we
find
a
better
telepath
to
work
with
he
did
mention
barbara
wilson
the
chief
he
told
himself
did
want
to
be
bothered
with
details
doggone
right
you
better
burris
said
you
treat
that
old
lady
as
if
she
were
the
queen
herself
understand
do
worry
malone
said
unhappily
we
are
he
hesitated
she
says
she
help
us
find
our
spy
all
right
but
we
got
to
do
it
her
way
or
else
she
wo
cooperate
do
it
her
way
then
burris
said
that
spy
chief
are
you
sure
burris
blinked
well
then
he
said
what
her
way
malone
took
a
deep
breath
first
he
said
we
had
to
come
here
and
pick
this
guy
up
this
william
logan
who
in
a
private
sanitarium
just
outside
of
las
vegas
that
number
one
miss
thompson
wants
to
get
all
the
telepaths
together
so
they
can
hold
mental
conversations
or
something
and
all
of
them
batty
burris
said
sure
malone
said
a
convention
of
nuts
and
me
in
the
middle
listen
chief
later
burris
said
when
this
is
over
we
can
all
resign
or
go
fishing
or
just
plain
shoot
ourselves
but
right
now
the
national
security
is
primary
malone
remember
that
okay
malone
sighed
okay
but
she
wants
all
the
nuts
here
go
along
with
her
burris
snapped
keep
her
happy
so
far
malone
she
the
only
lead
we
have
on
the
guy
who
swiping
information
from
yucca
flats
if
she
wants
something
malone
you
do
it
but
chief
do
interrupt
me
burris
said
if
she
wants
to
be
treated
like
a
queen
you
treat
her
like
one
malone
that
an
order
yes
sir
malone
said
sadly
but
chief
she
wants
us
to
buy
her
some
new
clothes
my
god
burris
exploded
is
that
all
new
clothes
get
put
on
the
expense
account
new
clothes
are
a
drop
in
the
bucket
well
she
thinks
we
need
new
clothes
too
maybe
you
do
burris
said
put
the
whole
thing
on
the
expense
account
you
do
think
i
going
to
quibble
about
a
few
dollars

malone
gave
up
yes

said
all
right
then
burris
said
call
me
tomorrow
meanwhile
good
luck
malone
chin
up
malone
said
yes
sir
and
reached
for
the
switch
but
burris
voice
stopped
him
just
one
thing
he
said
yes
chief
malone
said
burris
frowned
do
spend
any
more
for
the
clothes
than
you
have
to
he
said
malone
nodded
and
cut
off
when
the
director
image
had
vanished
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
of
the
hotel
room
outside
a
huge
sign
told
the
world
and
malone
that
this
was
the
hotel
but
malone
ignored
it
he
did
need
a
sign
he
knew
where
he
was
in
hot
water
he
thought
where
he
was
behind
him
the
door
opened
malone
turned
as
boyd
came
in
i
found
a
costume
shop
ken
he
said
great
malone
said
the
chief
authorized
it
he
did
boyd
round
face
fell
at
the
news

said

buy
her
whatever
she
wants

says
to

her
like
a
queen
that
boyd
said
we

now

too
well

boyd
said

bullfighters
costumes
and
mexican
stuff

their
helldorado

malone
said
boyd
shook
his
head
of
course
not
he
said
ken
this
is
on
the
expense
account
is
it
expense
account
malone
said
sure
it
is
boyd
looked
relieved
good
he
said
because
i
had
the
proprietor
phone
her
size
in
to
new
york

two
of
malone
said
the
chief
said

i
told
him

mine
tell
him
to

up
something
appropriate
for
us
boyd
blanched
visibly
for
us
malone
said
grimly
boyd
set
his
jaw
no
he
said

tom
malone
said
i
do
like
this
any
better
than
you
do
but
if
i
ca
resign
you
ca

costumes

everybody
but
boyd
said
and
stopped
after
a
second
he
went
on
malone
ken
fbi
agents
are
supposed
to
be
inconspicuous
are
they
malone
nodded
well
how
inconspicuous
are
we
going
to
be
in
this
stuff
it
an
idea
malone
said
but
it
is
a
very
good
one
our
first
job
is
to
keep
miss
thompson
happy
and
that
means
costumes
boyd
said
my
god
and
what
more
malone
added
from
now
on
she
majesty
got
that
ken
boyd
said
you
gone
nuts
malone
shook
his
head
no
i
have
he
said
i
just
wish
i
had
it
would
be
a
relief
me
too
boyd
said
he
started
for
the
door
and
turned
i
wish
i
could
have
stayed
in
san
francisco
he
said
why
should
she
insist
on
taking
along
the
beard
malone
said
my
beard
boyd
recoiled
right
malone
said
she
says
it
reminds
her
of
someone
she
knows
frankly
it
reminds
me
of
someone
too
only
i
do
know
who
boyd
gulped
i
shave
it
off
he
said
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
can
do
no
more
to
propitiate
the
gods
you
will
not
malone
said
firmly
touch
but
a
hair
of
yon
black
chin
and
i
peel
off
your
entire
skin
boyd
winced
now
malone
said
go
back
to
that
costume
shop
and
arrange
things
here
he
fished
in
his
pockets
and
came
out
with
a
crumpled
slip
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
boyd
that
a
list
of
my
clothing
sizes
get
another
list
from
b
miss
wilson
boyd
nodded
malone
thought
he
detected
a
strange
glint
in
the
other
man
eye
do
measure
her
yourself
he
said
just
ask
her
boyd
scratched
his
bearded
chin
and
nodded
slowly
all
right
ken
he
said
but
if
we
just
do
get
anywhere
do
blame
me
if
you
get
anywhere
malone
said
i
snatch
you
baldheaded
and
i
leave
the
beard
i
did
mean
with
miss
wilson
ken
boyd
said
i
meant
in
general
he
left
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
world
has
betrayed
him
his
back
looked
to
malone
like
the
back
of
a
man
on
his
way
to
the
scaffold
or
guillotine
the
door
closed
now
malone
thought
who
does
that
beard
remind
me
of
who
do
i
know
who
knows
miss
thompson
and
what
difference
does
it
make
nevertheless
he
told
himself
boyd
beard
beard
boyd
was
really
an
admirable
fact
of
nature
ever
since
beards
had
become
popular
again
in
the
and
fbi
agents
had
been
permitted
to
wear
them
malone
had
thought
about
growing
one
but
somehow
it
seem
right
now
looking
at
boyd
he
began
to
think
about
the
prospect
again
he
shrugged
the
notion
away
there
were
things
to
do
he
picked
up
the
phone
and
called
information
can
you
give
me
he
said
the
number
of
the
desert
edge
sanatorium
the
crimson
blob
of
the
setting
sun
was
already
painting
the
desert
sky
with
its
customary
purples
and
oranges
by
the
time
the
little
caravan
arrived
at
the
desert
edge
sanatorium
a
square
white
building
several
miles
out
of
las
vegas
malone
in
the
first
car
wondered
briefly
about
the
kind
of
patients
they
catered
to
people
driven
mad
by
or
neurotic
chorus
ponies
gambling
czars
with
delusions
of
sitting
in
the
front
seat
next
to
boyd
he
watched
the
unhappy
san
francisco
agent
manipulating
the
wheel
in
the
back
seat
queen
elizabeth
thompson
and
lady
barbara
the
nurse
were
located
and
her
majesty
was
chattering
away
like
a
magpie
malone
eyed
the
rearview
mirror
to
get
a
look
at
the
car
following
them
and
the
two
local
fbi
agents
in
it
they
were
he
thought
unbelievably
lucky
he
had
to
sit
and
listen
to
the
royal
personage
in
the
back
seat
of
course
as
soon
as
parliament
convenes
and
recognizes
me
she
was
saying
i
shall
confer
personages
on
all
of
you
right
now
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
knight
you
all
and
of
course
that
hardly
enough
but
i
think
i
shall
make
sir
kenneth
the
duke
of
columbia
sir
kenneth
malone
realized
was
himself
he
wondered
how
he
like
being
duke
of
columbia
and
would
the
president
be
surprised
and
sir
thomas
the
queen
continued
will
be
the
duke
of
what
sir
thomas
yes
your
majesty
boyd
said
trying
to
sound
both
eager
and
properly
respectful
what
would
you
like
to
be
duke
of
she
said
oh
boyd
said
after
a
second
thought
anything
that
pleases
your
majesty
but
apparently
his
thoughts
gave
him
away
you
from
upstate
new
york
the
queen
said
how
very
nice
then
you
must
be
made
the
duke
of
poughkeepsie
thank
you
your
majesty
boyd
said
malone
thought
he
detected
a
note
of
pride
in
the
man
voice
and
shot
a
glance
at
boyd
but
the
agent
was
driving
with
a
serene
face
and
an
economy
of
motion
of
poughkeepsie
malone
thought
he
leaned
back
and
adjusted
his
coat
the
plume
that
fell
from
his
cap
kept
tickling
his
neck
and
he
brushed
at
it
without
success
all
four
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
car
were
dressed
in
late
sixteenth
century
costumes
complete
with
ruffs
and
velvet
and
lace
filigree
her
majesty
and
lady
barbara
were
wearing
the
full
skirts
and
small
skullcaps
of
the
era
and
on
barbara
malone
thought
privately
the
gowns
did
look
at
all
disappointing
and
sir
thomas
and
malone
sir
kenneth
he
thought
sourly
were
clad
in
doublet
hose
and
long
coats
with
fur
trim
and
slashed
sleeves
and
all
of
them
were
loaded
down
weighted
down
staggeringly
with
gems
naturally
the
gems
were
fake
but
then
malone
thought
the
queen
was
mad
it
all
balanced
out
in
the
end
as
they
approached
the
sanitarium
malone
breathed
a
thankful
prayer
that
he
called
up
to
tell
the
head
physician
how
they
all
be
dressed
if
he
had
he
did
want
to
think
about
that
he
did
even
want
to
pass
it
by
hurriedly
on
a
dark
night
the
head
physician
frederic
dowson
was
waiting
for
them
on
the
steps
of
the
building
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
almost
no
hair
and
very
eyes
he
had
the
kind
of
face
that
a
gushing
female
would
probably
describe
malone
thought
as
craggy
but
it
did
look
in
the
least
attractive
to
malone
instead
it
looked
tough
and
forbidding
he
did
turn
a
hair
as
the
magnificently
robed
boyd
slid
from
the
front
seat
opened
the
rear
door
doffed
his
plumed
hat
and
in
one
low
sweep
made
a
great
bow
we
are
here
your
majesty
boyd
said
her
majesty
got
out
clutching
at
her
voluminous
skirts
in
a
worried
manner
to
keep
from
catching
them
on
the
you
know
sir
thomas
she
said
when
she
was
standing
free
of
the
car
i
think
we
must
be
related
ah
boyd
said
worriedly
i
certain
of
it
in
fact
her
majesty
went
on
you
look
just
exactly
like
my
poor
father
just
exactly
i
dare
say
you
come
from
one
of
the
sinister
branches
of
the
family
perhaps
you
are
a
brother
of
mine
removed
of
course
malone
grinned
and
tried
to
hide
the
expression
boyd
was
looking
puzzled
then
distantly
angered
nobody
had
ever
called
him
illegitimate
in
just
that
way
before
but
her
majesty
was
absolutely
right
malone
thought
the
agent
had
always
reminded
him
of
someone
and
now
at
last
he
knew
exactly
who
the
hair
had
been
black
either
but
red
boyd
was
in
elizabethan
costume
the
deadest
of
dead
ringers
for
henry
viii
malone
went
up
the
steps
to
where
dowson
was
standing
i
malone
he
said
checking
a
tendency
to
bow
i
called
earlier
today
is
this
william
logan
of
yours
ready
to
go
we
can
take
him
back
with
us
in
the
second
car
dowson
compressed
his
lips
and
looked
worried
come
in
malone
he
said
he
turned
just
as
the
second
carload
of
fbi
agents
began
emptying
itself
over
the
hospital
grounds
the
entire
procession
filed
into
the
hospital
office
the
two
local
agents
following
up
the
rear
since
they
were
not
a
part
of
her
majesty
personal
retinue
they
had
not
been
required
to
wear
court
costumes
in
a
way
malone
was
beginning
to
feel
sorry
for
them
he
himself
cut
a
nice
figure
in
the
outfit
he
thought
rather
like
errol
flynn
in
the
old
print
of
prince
and
the
but
there
was
no
denying
that
the
procession
looked
strange
file
clerks
and
receptionists
stopped
their
work
to
gape
at
the
four
bedizened
walkers
and
their
plainly
dressed
satellites
malone
needed
no
telepathic
talent
to
tell
what
they
were
thinking
a
whole
roundup
of
nuts
they
were
thinking
and
those
two
fellows
in
the
back
must
be
bringing
them
in
along
with
dr
dowson
malone
straightened
his
spine
really
he
did
see
why
elizabethan
costumes
had
ever
gone
out
of
style
elizabeth
was
back
was
she
either
elizabeth
ii
on
the
throne
or
elizabeth
i
right
behind
him
either
way
you
looked
at
it
when
they
were
all
inside
the
waiting
room
dowson
said
now
malone
just
what
is
all
this
about
he
rubbed
his
long
hands
together
i
fail
to
see
the
humor
of
the
situation
humor
malone
said
doctor
barbara
wilson
began
let
me
explain
you
see
these
ridiculous
costumes
dowson
said
waving
a
hand
at
them
you
may
feel
that
poking
fun
at
insanity
is
humorous
malone
but
let
me
tell
you
it
was
like
that
at
all
boyd
said
and
dowson
continued
in
a
somewhat
louder
voice
wanting
to
take
logan
away
from
us
logan
is
a
very
sick
man
malone
he
should
be
properly
cared
for
i
promise
we
take
good
care
of
him
malone
said
earnestly
the
elizabethan
clothes
were
fine
outdoors
but
in
a
heated
room
one
had
a
tendency
to
sweat
i
take
leave
to
doubt
that
dowson
said
eyeing
their
costumes
pointedly
miss
wilson
here
malone
volunteered
is
a
trained
psychiatric
nurse
barbara
in
her
gown
stepped
forward
dowson
she
said
let
me
assure
you
that
these
costumes
have
their
purpose
we
not
only
that
malone
said
there
are
a
group
of
trained
men
from
elizabeths
hospital
in
washington
who
are
going
to
take
the
best
of
care
of
him
he
said
nothing
whatever
about
yucca
flats
or
about
telepathy
why
spread
around
information
unnecessarily
but
i
do
understand
dowson
said
what
interest
could
the
fbi
have
in
an
insane
man
that
none
of
your
business
malone
said
he
reached
inside
his
robe
and
again
suppressing
a
tendency
to
bow
deeply
withdrew
an
legal
document
this
he
said
is
a
court
order
instructing
you
to
hand
over
to
us
the
person
of
one
william
logan
herein
identified
and
described
he
waved
it
at
the
doctor
that
your
william
logan
he
said
only
now
he
ours
dowson
took
the
papers
and
put
in
some
time
frowning
at
them
then
he
looked
up
again
at
malone
i
assume
that
i
have
some
discretion
in
this
matter
he
said
and
i
wonder
if
you
realize
just
how
ill
logan
is
we
have
his
case
histories
here
and
we
have
worked
with
him
for
some
time
barbara
wilson
said
but
i
might
say
that
we
are
beginning
to
understand
his
illness
dowson
said
i
honestly
do
think
it
would
be
proper
to
transfer
this
work
to
another
group
of
therapists
it
might
set
his
illness
back
cause
as
it
were
a
relapse
all
our
work
could
easily
be
nullified
please
doctor
barbara
wilson
began
i
afraid
the
court
order
got
to
stand
malone
said
privately
he
felt
sorry
for
dowson
who
was
obviously
enough
a
conscientious
man
trying
to
do
the
best
he
could
for
his
patient
i
sorry
dowson
he
said
we
expect
that
you
send
all
of
your
data
to
the
government
psychiatrists
and
naturally
any
concern
for
the
patient
welfare
will
be
our
concern
also
the
fbi
anxious
for
its
workers
to
get
the
reputation
of
careless
men
he
paused
wondering
what
other
bone
he
could
throw
the
man
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
elizabeth
men
will
be
happy
to
accept
your
cooperation
he
said
at
last
but
i
afraid
that
our
duty
is
clear
william
logan
goes
with
us
dowson
looked
at
them
sourly
does
he
have
to
get
dressed
up
like
a
masquerade
too
before
malone
could
answer
the
psychiatrist
added
anyhow
i
do
even
know
you
fbi
men
after
all
why
should
i
comply
with
orders
from
a
group
of
men
dressed
insanely
whom
i
do
even
know
malone
did
say
anything
he
just
got
up
and
walked
to
a
phone
on
a
small
table
near
the
wall
next
to
it
was
a
door
and
malone
wondered
uncomfortably
what
was
behind
it
maybe
dowson
had
a
small
arsenal
there
to
protect
his
patients
and
prevent
people
from
pirating
them
he
looked
back
at
the
set
and
dialed
burris
private
number
in
washington
when
the
director
face
appeared
on
the
screen
malone
said
burris
will
you
please
identify
me
to
dr
dowson
he
looked
over
at
dowson
you
recognize
andrew
burris
i
suppose
he
said
dowson
nodded
his
grim
face
showed
a
faint
shock
he
walked
to
the
phone
and
malone
stepped
back
to
let
him
talk
with
burris
my
name
is
dowson
he
said
i
psychiatric
director
here
at
desert
edge
sanatorium
and
your
men
my
men
have
orders
to
take
william
logan
from
your
care
burris
said
that
right
dowson
said
but
while
they
were
talking
queen
elizabeth
i
sidled
quietly
up
to
malone
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
sir
kenneth
she
whispered
in
the
faintest
of
voices
i
know
where
your
telepathic
spy
is
and
i
know
he
is
who
malone
said
what
why
where
he
blinked
and
whirled
it
could
be
true
they
could
solve
the
case
so
easily
but
the
queen
face
was
full
of
a
majestic
assurance
he
right
there
she
said
and
she
pointed
malone
followed
her
finger
it
was
aimed
directly
at
the
glowing
image
of
andrew
burris
director
of
the
fbi
malone
opened
his
mouth
but
nothing
came
out
not
even
air
he
was
breathing
he
stared
at
burris
for
a
long
moment
then
took
a
breath
and
looked
again
at
her
majesty
the
spy
he
whispered
that
right
she
said
but
that
he
had
to
fight
for
control
that
the
head
of
the
fbi
he
managed
to
say
do
you
mean
to
say
he
a
spy
burris
was
saying
i
afraid
this
is
a
matter
of
importance
dowson
we
can
not
tolerate
delay
you
have
the
court
order
obey
it
very
well
burris
dowson
said
with
an
obvious
lack
of
grace
i
release
him
to
malone
immediately
since
you
insist
malone
stared
fascinated
then
he
turned
back
to
the
little
old
lady
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
he
said
that
andrew
burris
is
a
telepathic
spy
oh
dear
me
her
majesty
said
obviously
aghast
my
goodness
gracious
is
that
burris
on
the
screen
it
is
malone
assured
her
a
look
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
told
him
that
neither
burris
in
washington
nor
dowson
or
any
others
in
the
room
had
heard
any
of
the
conversation
malone
lowered
his
whisper
some
more
just
in
case
that
the
head
of
the
fbi
he
said
well
then
her
majesty
said
burris
could
possibly
be
a
spy
then
could
he
not
if
he
the
head
of
the
fbi
of
course
not
burris
simply
is
a
spy
he
is
the
type
forget
all
about
mr
burris
i
ca
malone
said
at
random
i
work
for
him
he
closed
his
eyes
the
room
he
had
discovered
was
spinning
slightly
now
he
said
you
sure
he
not
a
spy
certainly
i
sure
she
said
with
her
most
regal
tones
do
you
doubt
the
word
of
your
sovereign
not
exactly
malone
said
truthfully
he
was
at
all
sure
not
at
all
but
why
tell
that
to
the
queen
shame
on
you
she
said
you
should
even
think
such
things
after
all
i
am
the
queen
are
i
but
there
was
a
sweet
gentle
smile
on
her
face
when
she
spoke
she
did
seem
to
be
really
irritated
sure
you
are
malone
said
but
malone
it
was
burris
voice
from
the
phone
malone
spun
around
take
logan
burris
said
and
get
going
there
been
enough
delay
as
it
is
yes
sir
malone
said
right
away
sir
anything
else
that
all
burris
said
good
night
the
screen
blanked
there
was
a
little
silence
all
right
doctor
boyd
said
he
looked
every
inch
a
king
and
malone
knew
exactly
what
king
bring
him
out
dowson
heaved
a
great
sigh
very
well
he
said
heavily
but
i
want
it
known
that
i
resent
this
highhanded
treatment
and
i
shall
write
a
letter
complaining
of
it
he
pressed
a
button
on
an
instrument
panel
in
his
desk
bring
logan
in
he
said
malone
was
in
the
least
worried
about
the
letter
burris
he
knew
would
take
care
of
anything
like
that
and
besides
he
had
other
things
to
think
about
the
door
to
the
next
room
had
opened
almost
immediately
and
two
husky
men
were
bringing
in
a
figure
whose
arms
were
wrapped
against
his
chest
while
the
jacket
sleeves
were
tied
behind
his
back
he
walked
where
the
attendants
led
him
but
his
eyes
were
looking
at
anything
in
the
room
they
stared
at
something
far
away
and
invisible
an
impalpable
shifting
nothingness
somewhere
in
the
infinite
distances
beyond
the
world
for
the
first
time
malone
felt
the
chill
of
panic
here
he
thought
was
insanity
of
a
very
real
and
frightening
kind
queen
elizabeth
thompson
was
one
thing
and
she
was
almost
funny
and
likeable
after
all
but
william
logan
was
something
else
and
something
that
sent
a
wave
of
cold
shivering
into
the
room
what
made
it
worse
was
that
logan
was
a
man
but
a
boy
barely
nineteen
malone
had
known
that
of
course
but
seeing
it
was
something
different
the
lanky
awkward
figure
wrapped
in
a
hospital
was
horrible
and
the
smooth
unconcerned
face
was
somehow
worse
there
was
no
threat
in
that
face
no
terror
or
anger
or
fear
it
was
merely
a
blank
it
was
not
a
human
face
its
complete
lack
of
emotion
or
expression
could
have
belonged
to
a
sleeping
child
of
ten
or
to
a
member
of
a
different
race
malone
looked
at
the
boy
and
looked
away
was
it
possible
that
logan
knew
what
he
was
thinking
he
thought
directly
at
the
still
boy
there
was
no
reply
none
at
all
malone
forced
himself
to
look
away
but
the
air
in
the
room
seemed
to
have
become
much
colder
the
attendants
stood
on
either
side
of
him
waiting
for
one
long
second
no
one
moved
and
then
dowson
reached
into
his
desk
drawer
and
produced
a
sheaf
of
papers
if
you
sign
these
for
the
government
he
said
you
may
have
logan
there
seems
little
else
that
i
can
do
malone
in
spite
of
my
earnest
pleas
i
sorry
malone
said
after
all
he
logan
did
he
after
a
look
at
the
boy
he
was
sure
any
more
but
the
queen
had
said
she
wanted
him
and
the
queen
word
was
law
or
what
passed
for
law
anyhow
at
least
for
the
moment
malone
took
the
papers
and
looked
them
over
there
was
nothing
special
about
them
they
were
merely
standard
release
forms
absolving
the
staff
and
management
of
desert
edge
sanatorium
from
every
conceivable
responsibility
under
any
conceivable
circumstances
as
far
as
william
logan
was
concerned
dowson
gave
malone
a
look
that
said
very
well
malone
i
will
play
pilate
and
wash
my
hands
of
the
matter
but
you
need
think
i
like
it
it
was
a
lot
for
one
look
to
say
but
dowson
dark
and
sunken
eyes
got
the
message
across
with
no
loss
in
transmission
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
seemed
to
be
more
coming
a
much
less
printable
message
was
apparently
on
the
way
through
those
glittering
sad
and
angry
eyes
malone
avoided
them
nervously
and
went
over
the
papers
again
instead
at
last
he
signed
them
and
handed
them
back
thanks
for
your
cooperation
dowson
he
said
briskly
feeling
ten
kinds
of
a
traitor
not
at
all
dowson
said
bitterly
logan
is
now
in
your
custody
i
must
trust
you
to
take
good
care
of
him
the
best
care
we
can
malone
said
it
did
seem
sufficient
he
added
the
best
possible
care
doctor
and
tried
to
look
dependable
and
trustworthy
like
a
boy
scout
he
was
aware
that
the
effort
failed
miserably
at
his
signal
the
two
plainclothes
fbi
men
took
over
from
the
attendants
they
marched
logan
out
to
their
car
and
malone
led
the
procession
back
to
boyd
automobile
a
procession
that
consisted
in
order
of
sir
kenneth
malone
prospective
duke
of
columbia
queen
elizabeth
i
lady
barbara
prospective
duchess
of
an
unspecified
county
and
sir
thomas
boyd
prospective
duke
of
poughkeepsie
malone
hummed
a
little
of
the
first
and
march
as
they
walked
somehow
he
thought
it
was
called
for
they
piled
into
the
car
boyd
at
the
wheel
with
malone
next
to
him
and
the
two
ladies
in
back
with
queen
elizabeth
sitting
directly
behind
sir
thomas
boyd
started
the
engine
and
they
turned
and
roared
off
well
said
her
majesty
with
an
air
of
great
complacence
that
that
makes
six
of
us
malone
looked
around
the
car
he
counted
the
people
there
were
four
he
said
puzzled
six
that
right
sir
kenneth
her
majesty
said
you
have
it
exactly
six
you
mean
six
telepaths
sir
thomas
asked
in
a
deferent
tone
of
voice
certainly
i
do
her
majesty
replied
we
telepaths
you
know
must
stick
together
that
the
reason
i
got
poor
little
willie
out
of
that
sanatorium
of
his
you
know
and
of
course
the
others
will
be
joining
us
do
you
think
it
time
for
your
nap
dear
lady
barbara
put
in
suddenly
my
it
was
obvious
that
queen
elizabeth
was
not
amused
your
nap
dear
lady
barbara
said
do
call
me
dear
her
majesty
snapped
i
sorry
your
majesty
barbara
murmured
but
really
my
dear
girl
her
majesty
said
i
am
not
a
child
i
am
your
sovereign
do
try
to
have
a
little
respect
why
i
remember
when
shakespeare
used
to
say
to
me
but
that
no
matter
not
now
about
those
telepaths
boyd
began
telepaths
her
majesty
said
ah
yes
we
must
all
stick
together
in
the
hospital
you
know
we
had
a
little
joke
the
patients
for
insulin
shock
therapy
used
to
say
we
do
stick
together
all
be
stuck
separately
do
you
see
sir
thomas
but
sir
kenneth
malone
said
trying
desperately
to
return
to
the
point
six
he
had
counted
them
up
in
his
mind
burris
had
mentioned
one
found
in
elizabeths
and
two
more
picked
up
later
with
queen
elizabeth
and
now
william
logan
that
made
five
unless
the
queen
was
counting
him
in
there
did
seem
any
good
reason
why
not
oh
no
her
majesty
said
with
a
little
trill
of
laughter
not
you
sir
kenneth
i
meant
mr
miles
sir
thomas
boyd
asked
mr
miles
that
right
her
majesty
said
his
name
is
barry
miles
and
your
fbi
men
found
him
an
hour
ago
in
new
orleans
they
bringing
him
to
yucca
flats
to
meet
the
rest
of
us
is
that
nice
lady
barbara
cleared
her
throat
it
really
is
necessary
for
you
to
try
to
get
my
attention
dear
the
queen
said
after
all
i
do
know
what
you
thinking
lady
barbara
blinked
i
still
want
to
suggest
respectfully
about
that
nap
she
began
my
dear
girl
the
queen
said
with
the
faintest
trace
of
impatience
i
do
not
feel
the
least
bit
tired
and
this
is
such
an
exciting
day
that
i
just
do
want
to
miss
any
of
it
besides
i
already
told
you
i
do
want
a
nap
it
is
polite
to
be
insistent
to
your
queen
no
matter
how
strongly
you
feel
about
a
matter
i
sure
learn
to
understand
that
dear
lady
barbara
opened
her
mouth
shut
it
again
and
opened
it
once
more
my
goodness
she
said
that
the
idea
her
majesty
said
approvingly
think
before
you
speak
and
then
do
speak
it
really
is
necessary
since
i
know
what
you
thinking
malone
said
grimly
about
this
new
telepath
this
barry
miles
did
they
find
him
in
a
her
majesty
said
sweetly
why
of
course
sir
kenneth
you
were
quite
right
when
you
thought
that
telepaths
went
insane
because
they
had
a
sense
they
could
effectively
use
and
because
no
one
believed
them
how
would
you
feel
if
nobody
believed
you
could
see
strange
malone
admitted
there
her
majesty
said
you
see
telepaths
do
go
insane
it
sort
of
an
occupational
disease
of
course
not
all
of
them
are
insane
not
all
of
them
malone
felt
the
faint
stirrings
of
hope
perhaps
they
would
turn
up
a
telepath
yet
who
was
completely
sane
and
rational
there
me
of
course
her
majesty
said
lady
barbara
gulped
audibly
boyd
said
nothing
but
gripped
the
wheel
of
the
car
more
tightly
and
malone
thought
to
himself
right
there
queen
elizabeth
who
says
she
is
and
then
he
thought
of
one
more
sane
telepath
but
the
knowledge
did
make
him
feel
any
better
it
was
of
course
the
spy
how
many
more
are
going
to
turn
up
malone
wondered
oh
that
about
all
of
us
the
queen
said
there
is
one
more
but
she
in
a
hospital
in
honolulu
and
your
men
wo
find
her
until
tomorrow
boyd
turned
do
you
mean
you
can
foretell
the
future
too
he
asked
in
a
strained
voice
lady
barbara
screamed
keep
your
eyes
on
the
wheel
and
your
hands
on
the
road
what
boyd
said
there
was
a
terrific
blast
of
noise
and
a
truck
went
by
in
the
opposite
direction
the
driver
a
big
ugly
man
with
no
hair
on
his
head
leaned
out
to
curse
at
the
quartet
but
his
mouth
remained
open
he
stared
at
the
four
elizabethans
and
said
nothing
at
all
as
he
whizzed
by
what
was
that
boyd
asked
faintly
that
malone
snapped
was
a
truck
and
it
was
due
entirely
to
the
mercy
of
god
that
we
did
hit
it
barbara
right
keep
your
eyes
on
the
wheel
and
your
hands
on
the
road
he
paused
and
thought
that
over
then
he
said
does
that
mean
anything
at
all
lady
barbara
was
confused
by
the
excitement
the
queen
said
calmly
it
all
right
now
dear
lady
barbara
blinked
across
the
seat
i
was
afraid
she
said
it
all
right
the
queen
said
i
take
care
of
you
this
malone
announced
to
no
one
in
particular
is
ridiculous
boyd
swept
the
car
around
a
curve
and
concentrated
grimly
on
the
road
after
a
second
the
queen
said
since
you
still
thinking
about
the
question
i
answer
you
what
question
malone
said
thoroughly
baffled
sir
thomas
asked
me
if
i
could
foretell
the
future
the
queen
said
equably
of
course
i
ca
that
silly
just
because
i
immortal
and
i
a
telepath
do
go
then
how
did
you
know
the
fbi
agents
were
going
to
find
the
girl
in
honolulu
tomorrow
boyd
said
because
the
queen
said
they
thinking
about
looking
in
the
hospital
tomorrow
and
when
they
look
they
certainly
find
her
boyd
said
oh
and
was
silent
but
malone
had
a
grim
question
why
did
you
tell
me
about
these
other
telepaths
before
he
said
you
could
have
saved
us
a
lot
of
work
oh
heavens
to
betsy
sir
kenneth
her
majesty
exclaimed
how
could
i
after
all
the
proper
precautions
had
to
be
taken
first
they
i
told
you
all
the
others
were
crazy
crazy
i
mean
and
they
just
would
be
safe
without
the
proper
precautions
perhaps
you
ought
to
go
back
to
the
hospital
too
barbara
said
and
added
your
majesty
just
in
time
but
if
i
did
dear
her
majesty
said
you
lose
your
chance
to
become
a
duchess
and
that
would
be
at
all
nice
besides
having
so
much
she
trilled
a
laugh
again
riding
around
like
this
is
just
wonderful
she
said
you
important
for
national
malone
said
to
himself
that
right
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
the
country
needs
me
and
i
happy
to
serve
that
is
the
job
of
a
sovereign
fine
malone
said
hoping
it
was
well
then
said
her
majesty
that
settles
that
we
have
a
whole
night
ahead
of
us
sir
kenneth
what
do
you
say
we
make
a
night
of
it
knight
who
malone
said
he
felt
confused
again
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
always
feeling
confused
lately
do
be
silly
sir
kenneth
her
majesty
said
there
are
times
and
times
sure
malone
said
at
random
time
and
a
he
thought
for
what
is
your
majesty
thinking
of
he
asked
with
trepidation
i
want
to
take
a
tour
of
las
vegas
her
majesty
said
primly
lady
barbara
shook
her
head
i
afraid
that
not
possible
your
majesty
she
said
and
why
not
pray
her
majesty
said
no
i
can
see
what
thinking
it
not
safe
to
let
me
go
wandering
around
in
a
strange
city
and
particularly
if
that
city
is
las
vegas
well
dear
i
can
assure
you
that
it
perfectly
safe
we
got
work
to
do
boyd
contributed
malone
said
nothing
he
stared
bleakly
at
the
hood
ornament
on
the
car
i
have
made
my
wishes
known
the
queen
said
lady
barbara
said
but
boyd
however
knew
when
to
give
in
yes
your
majesty
he
said
she
smiled
graciously
at
him
and
answered
lady
barbara
only
by
a
slight
lift
of
her
regal
eyebrow
malone
had
been
thinking
about
something
else
when
he
was
sure
he
had
a
firm
grip
on
himself
he
turned
your
majesty
tell
me
something
he
said
you
can
read
my
mind
right
well
of
course
sir
kenneth
her
majesty
said
i
thought
proved
that
to
you
and
as
for
what
you
about
to
ask
no
malone
said
please
let
me
ask
the
questions
before
you
answer
them
it
less
confusing
that
way
i
cheerfully
admit
that
it
should
be
but
it
is
please
certainly
sir
kenneth
if
you
wish
the
queen
said
she
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
waited
quietly
okay
malone
said
now
if
you
can
read
my
mind
then
you
must
know
that
i
do
believe
that
you
are
queen
elizabeth
of
england
the
first
i
mean
malone
barbara
wilson
said
suddenly
i
it
all
right
child
the
queen
said
he
does
disturb
me
and
i
do
wish
you
call
him
sir
kenneth
that
his
title
you
know
now
that
what
i
mean
malone
said
why
do
you
want
us
to
as
if
we
believe
you
when
you
know
we
do
because
that
the
way
people
do
act
the
queen
said
calmly
very
few
people
really
believe
that
their
superiors
superior
almost
none
of
them
do
in
fact
now
wait
a
minute
boyd
began
no
no
it
quite
true
the
queen
said
and
unpleasant
as
it
may
be
we
must
learn
to
face
the
truth
that
the
path
of
sanity
lady
barbara
made
a
strangled
noise
but
her
majesty
continued
unruffled
nearly
everybody
suffers
from
the
silly
delusion
that
he
possibly
equal
to
but
very
probably
superior
to
everybody
else
my
goodness
where
would
we
be
if
that
were
true
malone
felt
that
a
comment
was
called
for
and
he
made
one
who
knows
he
said
all
the
things
people
do
toward
their
superiors
the
queen
said
are
done
for
social
reasons
for
instance
sir
kenneth
you
realize
fully
how
you
feel
about
mr
burris
he
a
hell
of
a
fine
guy
malone
said
i
work
for
him
he
a
good
director
of
the
fbi
of
course
the
queen
said
but
you
believe
you
could
do
the
job
just
as
well
or
perhaps
a
little
better
i
do
not
malone
said
angrily
her
majesty
reserved
a
dignified
silence
after
a
while
malone
said
and
what
if
i
do
why
nothing
her
majesty
said
you
do
think
burris
is
any
smarter
or
better
than
you
are
but
you
treat
him
as
if
you
did
all
i
am
insisting
on
is
the
same
treatment
but
if
we
do
believe
boyd
began
bless
you
her
majesty
said
i
ca
help
the
way
you
but
as
queen
i
do
have
some
control
over
the
way
you
malone
thought
it
over
you
have
a
point
there
he
said
at
last
barbara
said
but
yes
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
i
do
she
seemed
to
be
ignoring
lady
barbara
perhaps
malone
thought
she
was
still
angry
over
the
nap
affair
it
not
that
the
queen
said
not
what
boyd
said
thoroughly
confused
not
the
naps
the
queen
said
what
naps
boyd
said
malone
said
i
was
thinking
good
boyd
said
keep
it
up
i
driving
everything
going
to
hell
around
me
but
i
driving
a
red
light
appeared
ahead
boyd
jammed
on
the
brakes
with
somewhat
more
than
the
necessary
force
and
malone
was
thrown
forward
with
a
grunt
behind
him
there
were
two
ladylike
squeals
malone
struggled
upright
barbara
he
called
are
you
all
right
then
he
remembered
the
queen
it
all
right
her
majesty
said
i
can
understand
your
concern
for
lady
barbara
she
smiled
at
malone
as
he
turned
malone
gaped
at
her
of
course
she
knew
what
he
thought
about
barbara
she
been
reading
his
mind
and
apparently
she
was
on
his
side
that
was
good
even
though
it
made
him
slightly
nervous
to
think
about
now
the
queen
said
suddenly
what
about
tonight
tonight
yes
of
course
the
queen
said
she
smiled
and
put
up
a
hand
to
pat
at
her
white
hair
under
the
elizabethan
skullcap
i
think
i
should
like
to
go
to
the
palace
she
said
after
all
is
that
where
a
queen
should
be
boyd
said
in
a
kind
of
explosion
london
england
oh
dear
me
the
queen
began
and
barbara
said
i
afraid
that
i
simply
ca
allow
anything
like
that
overseas
i
did
mean
overseas
dear
her
majesty
said
sir
kenneth
please
explain
to
these
people
the
palace
malone
knew
was
more
properly
known
as
the
golden
palace
it
was
right
in
las
vegas
convenient
to
all
sources
of
money
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
one
of
the
biggest
gambling
houses
along
the
las
vegas
strip
a
veritable
chaos
of
wheels
cards
dice
chips
and
other
such
devices
malone
explained
all
this
to
the
others
wondering
meanwhile
why
miss
thompson
wanted
to
go
there
not
miss
thompson
sir
kenneth
her
majesty
said
not
miss
thompson
what
boyd
said
what
going
on
anyhow
she
reading
my
mind
malone
said
well
then
boyd
snapped
tell
her
to
keep
it
to
herself
the
car
started
up
again
with
a
roar
and
malone
and
the
others
were
thrown
around
again
this
time
toward
the
back
there
was
a
chorus
of
groans
and
squeals
and
they
were
on
their
way
once
more
to
reply
to
your
question
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
lady
barbara
said
with
some
composure
what
question
your
majesty
the
queen
nodded
regally
at
her
sir
kenneth
was
wondering
why
i
wished
to
go
to
the
golden
palace
she
said
and
my
reply
is
this
it
is
none
of
your
business
why
i
want
to
go
there
after
all
is
my
word
law
or
is
it
there
did
seem
to
be
a
good
enough
answer
to
that
malone
thought
sadly
he
kept
quiet
and
was
relieved
to
note
that
the
others
did
the
same
however
after
a
second
he
thought
of
something
else
your
majesty
he
began
carefully
we
got
to
go
to
yucca
flats
tomorrow
remember
certainly
the
queen
said
my
memory
is
quite
good
thank
you
but
that
is
tomorrow
morning
we
have
the
rest
of
the
night
left
only
a
little
after
nine
you
know
heavens
barbara
said
is
it
that
late
it
even
later
boyd
said
sourly
it
much
later
than
you
think
and
it
getting
later
all
the
time
malone
added
pretty
soon
the
sun
will
go
out
and
all
life
on
earth
will
end
wo
that
be
nice
and
peaceful
i
looking
forward
to
it
boyd
said
i
not
barbara
said
but
i
got
to
get
some
sleep
tonight
if
i
going
to
be
any
good
at
all
tomorrow
pretty
good
right
malone
thought
but
he
did
say
a
word
he
felt
the
queen
eye
on
him
but
did
turn
around
after
all
she
was
on
his
side
was
she
at
any
rate
she
did
say
anything
perhaps
it
would
be
best
barbara
said
if
you
and
i
your
majesty
just
went
home
and
rested
up
some
other
time
then
when
there
nothing
vital
to
do
we
could
no
the
queen
said
we
could
really
lady
barbara
how
often
will
i
have
to
remind
you
of
the
duties
you
owe
your
sovereign
not
the
least
of
which
is
obedience
as
dear
old
ben
used
to
say
ben
malone
said
and
immediately
wished
he
had
johnson
dear
boy
the
queen
said
really
a
remarkable
man
and
such
a
good
friend
to
poor
will
why
did
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
how
he
actually
paid
will
rent
in
london
once
upon
a
time
that
was
while
will
and
that
anne
of
his
were
having
one
of
their
arguments
of
course
i
did
tell
you
that
story
did
i
no
malone
said
truthfully
but
his
voice
was
full
of
foreboding
if
i
might
remind
your
majesty
of
the
subject
he
added
tentatively
i
should
like
to
say
remind
me
of
the
subject
the
queen
said
obviously
delighted
what
a
lovely
pun
and
how
much
better
because
purely
unconscious
my
my
sir
kenneth
i
never
suspected
you
of
a
pointed
sense
of
humor
could
you
be
a
descendant
of
sir
richard
greene
i
wonder
i
doubt
it
malone
said
my
ancestors
were
all
poor
but
irish
he
paused
or
if
you
prefer
irish
but
poor
another
pause
and
then
he
added
if
that
means
anything
at
all
which
i
doubt
in
any
case
the
queen
said
her
eyes
twinkling
you
were
about
to
enter
a
new
objection
to
our
little
visit
to
the
palace
were
you
not
malone
admitted
as
much
i
really
think
that
her
eyes
grew
suddenly
cold
if
i
hear
any
more
objections
sir
kenneth
i
shall
not
only
rescind
your
knighthood
and
when
i
regain
my
rightful
kingdom
deny
you
your
dukedom
but
i
shall
refuse
to
cooperate
any
further
in
the
business
of
project
isle
malone
turned
cold
his
face
he
knew
without
glancing
in
the
mirror
was
white
and
pale
he
thought
of
what
burris
would
do
to
him
if
he
did
follow
through
on
his
assigned
job
even
if
he
was
as
good
as
burris
thought
he
was
he
really
liked
being
an
fbi
agent
he
did
want
to
be
fired
and
burris
had
said
give
her
anything
she
wants
he
gulped
and
tried
to
make
his
face
look
normal
all
right
he
said
fine
we
go
to
the
palace
he
tried
to
ignore
the
pall
of
apprehension
that
fell
over
the
car
the
management
of
the
golden
palace
had
been
in
business
for
many
long
dreary
profitable
years
and
each
member
of
the
staff
thought
he
or
she
had
seen
just
about
everything
there
was
to
be
seen
and
those
that
were
new
felt
an
obligation
to
as
if
they
seen
everything
therefore
when
the
entourage
of
queen
elizabeth
i
strolled
into
the
main
salon
not
a
single
eye
was
batted
not
a
single
gasp
was
heard
nevertheless
the
staff
kept
a
discreet
eye
on
the
crew
drunks
rich
men
or
arabian
millionaires
were
all
familiar
but
a
group
out
of
the
sixteenth
century
was
something
else
again
malone
almost
strutted
conscious
of
the
sidelong
glances
the
group
was
drawing
but
it
was
obvious
that
sir
thomas
was
the
major
attraction
even
if
you
could
accept
the
idea
of
people
in
strange
costumes
the
sight
of
a
living
breathing
absolute
duplicate
of
king
henry
viii
was
a
little
too
much
to
take
it
has
been
reported
that
two
ladies
named
jane
and
one
named
catherine
came
down
with
sudden
headaches
and
left
the
salon
within
five
minutes
of
the
arrival
malone
felt
he
knew
however
why
he
was
drawing
his
full
share
of
attention
he
felt
a
little
out
of
place
the
costume
was
one
thing
and
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
beginning
to
enjoy
it
even
with
the
weight
of
the
stuff
it
was
going
to
be
a
wrench
to
go
back
to
suits
and
plain
white
shirts
but
he
did
feel
that
he
should
have
been
carrying
a
sword
instead
he
had
a
magnum
colt
snuggled
beneath
his
left
armpit
somehow
a
magnum
colt
did
seem
as
romantic
as
a
sword
malone
pictured
himself
saying
take
that
varlet
was
varlet
what
you
called
them
he
wondered
maybe
it
was
valet
take
that
valet
he
muttered
no
that
sounded
even
worse
oh
well
he
could
look
it
up
later
the
truth
was
that
he
had
been
born
in
the
wrong
century
he
could
imagine
himself
at
the
mermaid
tavern
with
shakespeare
and
all
the
rest
of
them
he
wondered
if
richard
greene
would
be
there
then
he
wondered
who
richard
greene
was
behind
sir
kenneth
sir
thomas
boyd
strode
looking
majestic
as
if
he
were
about
to
fling
purses
of
gold
to
the
citizenry
as
a
matter
of
fact
malone
thought
he
was
they
all
were
purses
of
good
old
united
states
of
america
gold
behind
sir
thomas
came
queen
elizabeth
and
her
lady
barbara
wilson
they
made
a
beautiful
foursome
the
roulette
table
her
majesty
said
with
dignity
precede
me
they
pushed
their
way
through
the
crowd
most
of
the
customers
were
either
excited
enough
drunk
enough
or
both
to
see
nothing
in
the
least
incongruous
about
a
royal
family
of
the
tudors
invading
the
golden
palace
very
few
of
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
seemed
to
notice
the
group
they
were
roulette
players
they
noticed
nothing
but
the
table
and
the
wheel
malone
wondered
what
they
were
thinking
about
decided
to
ask
queen
elizabeth
and
then
decided
against
it
he
felt
it
would
make
him
nervous
to
know
her
majesty
took
a
handful
of
chips
the
handful
was
worth
malone
knew
exactly
five
thousand
dollars
that
he
thought
ought
to
last
them
an
evening
even
in
the
golden
palace
in
the
center
of
the
strip
inside
the
city
limits
of
las
vegas
itself
the
five
thousand
would
have
lasted
much
longer
but
her
majesty
wanted
the
palace
and
the
palace
it
was
malone
began
to
smile
since
he
could
avoid
the
evening
he
was
determined
to
enjoy
it
it
was
sort
of
fun
in
its
way
indulging
a
sweet
harmless
old
lady
and
there
was
nothing
they
could
do
until
the
next
morning
anyhow
his
indulgent
smile
faded
very
suddenly
her
majesty
plunked
the
entire
handful
of
chips
thousand
dollars
malone
thought
dazedly
onto
the
table
five
thousand
she
said
in
clear
cool
measured
tones
on
number
one
the
croupier
blinked
only
slightly
he
bowed
yes
your
majesty
he
said
malone
was
briefly
thankful
in
the
midst
of
his
black
horror
that
he
had
called
the
management
and
told
them
that
the
queen
plays
were
backed
by
the
united
states
government
her
majesty
was
going
to
get
unlimited
credit
and
a
good
deal
of
awed
and
somewhat
puzzled
respect
malone
watched
the
spin
begin
with
mixed
feelings
there
was
five
thousand
dollars
riding
on
the
little
ball
but
after
all
her
majesty
was
a
telepath
did
that
mean
anything
he
had
decided
by
the
time
the
wheel
stopped
and
by
then
he
have
to
decide
the
croupier
said
tonelessly
red
even
and
high
he
raked
in
the
chips
with
a
nonchalant
air
malone
felt
as
if
he
had
swallowed
his
stomach
boyd
and
lady
barbara
standing
nearby
had
absolutely
no
expressions
on
their
faces
malone
needed
no
telepath
to
tell
him
what
they
were
thinking
they
were
exactly
the
same
as
he
was
they
were
incapable
of
thought
but
her
majesty
never
batted
an
eyelash
come
sir
kenneth
she
said
let
go
on
to
the
poker
tables
she
swept
out
her
entourage
followed
her
shambling
a
little
and
malone
was
still
thinking
about
the
five
thousand
dollars
oh
well
burris
had
said
to
give
the
lady
anything
she
wanted
my
god
he
thought
she
have
to
play
for
royal
stakes
i
am
after
all
a
queen
she
whispered
back
to
him
malone
thought
about
the
national
debt
he
wondered
if
a
million
more
or
less
would
make
any
real
difference
there
would
be
questions
asked
in
committees
about
it
he
tried
to
imagine
himself
explaining
the
evening
to
a
group
of
congressmen
well
you
see
gentlemen
there
was
this
roulette
wheel
he
gave
it
up
then
he
wondered
how
much
hotter
the
water
was
going
to
get
and
he
stopped
thinking
altogether
in
in
the
next
room
there
were
scattered
tables
at
one
a
poker
game
was
in
full
swing
only
five
were
playing
one
by
his
tails
uniform
was
easily
recognizable
as
a
house
dealer
the
other
four
were
all
men
one
of
them
in
full
cowboy
regalia
the
tudors
descended
upon
them
with
great
suddenness
and
the
house
dealer
looked
up
and
almost
lost
his
cigarette
we
have
any
money
your
majesty
malone
whispered
she
smiled
up
at
him
sweetly
and
then
drew
him
aside
if
you
were
a
telepath
she
said
how
would
play
poker
malone
thought
about
that
for
a
minute
and
then
turned
to
look
for
boyd
but
sir
thomas
did
even
have
to
be
given
instructions
another
five
hundred
he
said
her
majesty
sniffed
audibly
another
five
thousand
she
said
regally
boyd
looked
malonewards
malone
looked
defeated
boyd
turned
with
a
small
sigh
and
headed
for
the
cashier
booth
three
minutes
later
he
was
back
with
a
fat
fistful
of
chips
five
grand
malone
whispered
to
him
ten
boyd
said
i
know
when
to
back
a
winner
her
majesty
went
over
to
the
table
the
dealer
had
regained
control
but
looked
up
at
them
with
a
puzzled
stare
you
know
the
queen
said
with
an
obvious
attempt
to
put
the
man
at
his
ease
i
always
wanted
to
visit
a
gambling
hall
sure
lady
the
dealer
said
naturally
may
i
sit
down
the
dealer
looked
at
the
group
how
about
your
friends
he
said
cautiously
the
queen
shook
her
head
they
would
rather
watch
i
sure
for
once
malone
blessed
the
woman
telepathic
talent
he
boyd
and
barbara
wilson
formed
a
kind
of
guard
of
honor
around
the
chair
which
her
majesty
occupied
boyd
handed
over
the
new
pile
of
chips
and
was
favored
with
a
royal
smile
this
is
a
poker
game
the
dealer
said
to
her
quietly
i
know
i
know
her
majesty
said
with
a
trace
of
testiness
roll
the
dealer
stared
at
her
popeyed
next
to
her
the
gentleman
in
the
cowboy
outfit
turned
are
you
from
around
these
parts
he
said
oh
no
the
queen
said
i
from
england
england
the
cowboy
looked
puzzled
you
do
seem
to
have
any
accent
he
said
at
last
certainly
not
the
queen
said
i
lost
that
i
been
over
here
a
great
many
years
malone
hoped
fervently
that
her
majesty
would
mention
just
how
many
years
he
did
think
he
could
stand
it
and
he
was
almost
grateful
for
the
cowboy
nasal
twang
oil
he
said
oh
no
her
majesty
said
the
government
is
providing
this
money
the
government
certainly
her
majesty
said
the
fbi
you
know
there
was
a
long
silence
at
last
the
dealer
said
draw
your
game
if
you
please
her
majesty
said
the
dealer
shrugged
and
apparently
commended
his
soul
to
a
god
he
passed
the
pasteboards
around
the
table
with
the
air
of
one
who
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
world
her
majesty
picked
up
her
hand
the
ante
ten
the
dealer
said
softly
without
looking
her
majesty
removed
a
chip
from
the
pile
before
her
and
sent
it
spinning
to
the
middle
of
the
table
the
dealer
opened
his
mouth
but
said
nothing
malone
meanwhile
was
peering
over
the
queen
shoulder
she
held
a
pair
of
nines
a
four
a
three
and
a
jack
the
man
to
the
left
of
the
dealer
announced
glumly
ca
open
the
next
man
grinned
open
for
twenty
he
said
malone
closed
his
eyes
he
heard
the
cowboy
say
i
in
and
he
opened
his
eyes
again
the
queen
was
pushing
two
chips
toward
the
center
of
the
table
the
next
man
dropped
and
the
dealer
looked
round
the
table
how
many
the
man
who
could
open
took
three
cards
the
man
who
opened
for
twenty
stood
pat
malone
shuddered
invisibly
that
he
figured
meant
a
straight
or
better
and
queen
elizabeth
thompson
was
going
in
against
at
least
a
straight
with
a
pair
of
nines
jack
high
for
the
first
time
it
was
borne
in
on
malone
that
being
a
telepath
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
you
were
a
good
poker
player
even
if
you
knew
what
every
other
person
at
the
table
held
you
could
still
make
a
whole
lot
of
stupid
mistakes
he
looked
nervously
at
queen
elizabeth
but
her
face
was
serene
apparently
she
been
following
the
thoughts
of
the
poker
players
and
not
concentrating
on
him
at
all
that
was
a
relief
he
felt
for
the
first
time
in
days
as
if
he
could
think
freely
the
cowboy
said
two
and
took
them
it
was
her
majesty
turn
i
take
two
she
said
and
threw
away
the
three
and
four
it
left
her
with
the
nine
of
spades
and
the
nine
of
hearts
and
the
jack
of
diamonds
these
were
joined
in
a
matter
of
seconds
by
two
bright
new
cards
the
six
of
clubs
and
the
three
of
hearts
malone
closed
his
eyes
he
thought
it
was
only
thirty
bucks
down
the
drain
practically
nothing
of
course
her
majesty
dropped
at
once
knowing
what
the
other
players
held
she
knew
she
could
beat
them
after
the
draw
but
she
did
like
to
take
long
chances
malone
thought
miserably
imagine
trying
to
fill
a
full
house
on
one
pair
slowly
as
the
minutes
passed
the
pile
of
chips
before
her
majesty
dwindled
once
malone
saw
her
win
with
two
pair
against
a
reckless
man
trying
to
fill
a
straight
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
but
whatever
was
going
on
her
majesty
face
was
as
calm
as
if
she
were
asleep
malone
worked
overtime
if
the
queen
had
been
losing
so
obviously
the
dealer
might
have
mistaken
the
play
of
naked
emotion
across
his
visage
for
a
series
of
particularly
obvious
signals
an
hour
went
by
barbara
left
to
find
a
ladies
lounge
where
she
could
sit
down
and
try
to
relax
fascinated
in
a
horrible
sort
of
way
both
malone
and
boyd
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
while
hand
after
hand
went
by
and
the
ten
thousand
dollars
dwindled
to
half
that
to
a
quarter
and
even
less
her
majesty
it
seemed
was
a
damn
poor
poker
player
the
ante
had
been
raised
by
this
time
her
majesty
was
losing
one
hundred
dollars
a
hand
even
before
the
betting
began
but
she
showed
not
the
slightest
indication
to
stop
we
got
to
get
up
in
the
morning
malone
announced
to
no
one
in
particular
when
he
thought
he
could
possibly
stand
another
hour
of
the
game
so
we
do
her
majesty
said
with
a
little
regretful
sigh
very
well
then
just
one
more
hand
it
a
shame
to
lose
you
the
cowboy
said
to
her
quite
sincerely
he
had
been
winning
steadily
ever
since
her
majesty
sat
down
and
malone
thought
that
the
man
should
by
this
time
be
awfully
grateful
to
the
united
states
government
somehow
he
doubted
that
this
gratitude
existed
malone
wondered
if
she
should
be
allowed
to
stay
for
one
more
hand
there
was
he
estimated
about
two
thousand
dollars
in
front
of
her
then
he
wondered
how
he
was
going
to
stop
her
the
cards
were
dealt
the
first
man
said
quietly
open
for
two
hundred
malone
looked
at
the
queen
hand
it
contained
the
ace
king
queen
and
ten
of
clubs
and
the
seven
of
spades
he
thought
could
possibly
be
thinking
of
filling
a
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
was
the
second
man
said
and
raise
two
hundred
the
queen
equably
tossed
counting
malone
thought
the
ante
five
hundred
into
the
pot
the
cowboy
muttered
to
himself
for
a
second
and
finally
shoved
in
his
money
i
think
i
raise
it
another
five
hundred
the
queen
said
calmly
malone
wanted
to
die
of
shock
unfortunately
he
remained
alive
and
watching
he
saw
the
last
man
after
some
debate
internal
shove
a
total
of
one
thousand
dollars
into
the
pot
cards
said
the
dealer
the
first
man
said
one
it
was
too
much
to
hope
for
malone
thought
if
that
first
man
were
trying
to
fill
a
straight
or
a
flush
maybe
he
would
make
it
and
maybe
something
final
would
happen
to
all
the
other
players
but
that
was
the
only
way
he
could
see
for
her
majesty
to
win
the
card
was
dealt
the
second
man
stood
pat
and
malone
green
tinge
became
obvious
to
the
veriest
dunce
the
cowboy
on
her
right
asked
for
a
card
received
it
and
sat
back
without
a
trace
of
expression
the
queen
said
i
try
one
for
size
she
picked
up
poker
lingo
and
the
basic
rules
of
the
game
malone
realized
from
the
other
players
or
possibly
from
someone
at
the
hospital
itself
years
ago
he
wished
she
picked
up
something
less
dangerous
instead
like
a
love
of
hunting
or
but
no
it
had
to
be
poker
the
queen
threw
away
her
seven
of
spades
showing
more
sense
than
malone
had
given
her
credit
for
at
any
time
during
the
game
she
let
the
other
card
fall
and
did
look
at
it
she
smiled
up
at
malone
and
boyd
live
dangerously
she
said
gaily
malone
gave
her
a
hollow
laugh
the
last
man
drew
one
card
too
and
the
betting
began
the
queen
remaining
thousand
was
gone
before
an
eye
could
notice
it
she
turned
to
boyd
sir
thomas
she
said
another
five
thousand
please
at
once
boyd
said
nothing
at
all
but
marched
off
malone
noticed
however
that
his
step
was
neither
as
springy
nor
as
confident
as
it
had
been
before
for
himself
malone
was
sure
that
he
could
not
walk
at
all
maybe
he
thought
hopefully
the
floor
would
open
up
and
swallow
them
all
he
tried
to
imagine
explaining
the
loss
of
to
burris
and
some
congressmen
and
after
that
he
watched
the
floor
narrowly
hoping
for
the
smallest
hint
of
a
crack
in
the
palazzo
marble
may
i
raise
the
whole
five
thousand
the
queen
said
it
okay
with
me
the
dealer
said
how
about
the
rest
of
you
the
four
grunts
he
got
expressed
a
suppressed
eagerness
the
queen
took
the
new
chips
boyd
had
brought
her
and
shoved
them
into
the
center
of
the
table
with
a
fine
careless
gesture
of
her
hand
she
smiled
gaily
at
everybody
seeing
me
she
said
everybody
was
well
you
see
it
was
this
way
malone
muttered
to
himself
rehearsing
he
that
one
of
the
others
would
raise
again
but
no
one
did
after
all
each
of
them
must
be
convinced
that
he
held
a
great
hand
and
though
raising
had
gone
on
throughout
the
hand
each
must
now
be
afraid
of
going
the
least
little
bit
too
far
and
scaring
the
others
out
mr
congressman
malone
muttered
there
this
game
called
poker
you
play
it
with
cards
and
money
chiefly
money
that
was
any
good
you
been
called
the
dealer
said
to
the
first
man
who
opened
the
hand
a
year
or
so
before
why
sure
the
player
said
and
laid
down
a
pair
of
aces
a
pair
of
threes
and
a
four
one
of
the
threes
and
the
four
were
clubs
that
reduced
the
already
improbable
chances
of
the
queen
coming
up
with
a
flush
sorry
said
the
second
man
and
laid
down
a
straight
with
a
single
gesture
the
straight
was
and
there
were
no
clubs
in
it
malone
felt
devoutly
thankful
for
that
the
second
man
reached
for
the
money
but
under
the
popeyed
gaze
of
the
dealer
the
fifth
man
laid
down
another
straight
this
one
ten
high
the
nine
was
a
club
malone
felt
the
odds
go
down
right
in
his
own
stomach
and
now
the
cowboy
put
down
his
cards
the
king
of
diamonds
the
king
of
hearts
the
jack
of
diamonds
the
jack
of
spades
and
the
jack
of
hearts
full
house
well
said
the
cowboy
i
suppose
that
does
it
the
queen
said
please
one
moment
the
cowboy
stopped
halfway
in
his
reach
for
the
enormous
pile
of
chips
the
queen
laid
down
her
four
clubs
ace
king
queen
and
ten
and
for
the
first
time
flipped
over
her
fifth
card
it
was
the
jack
of
clubs
my
god
the
cowboy
said
and
it
sounded
like
a
prayer
a
royal
flush
naturally
the
queen
said
what
else
her
majesty
calmly
scooped
up
the
tremendous
pile
of
chips
the
cowboy
hands
fell
away
five
mouths
were
open
around
the
table
her
majesty
stood
up
she
smiled
sweetly
at
the
men
around
the
table
thank
you
very
much
gentlemen
she
said
she
handed
the
chips
to
malone
who
took
them
in
nerveless
fingers
sir
kenneth
she
said
i
hereby
appoint
you
temporary
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
at
least
until
parliament
convenes
there
was
malone
thought
at
least
thousand
dollars
in
the
pile
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
so
instead
of
using
up
words
he
went
and
cashed
in
the
chips
for
once
he
realized
the
government
had
made
money
on
an
investment
it
was
probably
the
first
time
since
malone
thought
vaguely
that
the
government
ought
to
make
more
investments
like
the
one
he
was
cashing
in
if
it
did
the
national
debt
could
be
wiped
out
in
a
matter
of
days
he
brought
the
money
back
boyd
and
the
queen
were
waiting
for
him
but
barbara
was
still
in
the
ladies
lounge
she
on
the
way
out
the
queen
informed
him
and
sure
enough
in
a
minute
they
saw
the
figure
approaching
them
malone
smiled
at
her
and
tentatively
she
smiled
back
they
began
the
long
march
to
the
exit
of
the
club
slowly
and
regally
though
not
by
choice
the
crowd
it
seemed
would
let
them
go
malone
never
found
out
then
or
later
how
the
news
of
her
majesty
winnings
had
gone
through
the
place
so
fast
but
everyone
seemed
to
know
about
it
the
queen
was
the
recipient
of
several
low
bows
and
a
few
drunken
curtsies
and
when
they
reached
the
front
door
at
last
the
doorman
said
in
a
most
respectful
tone
good
evening
your
majesty
the
queen
positively
beamed
at
him
so
to
his
own
great
surprise
did
sir
kenneth
malone
outside
it
was
about
four
in
the
morning
they
climbed
into
the
car
and
headed
back
toward
the
hotel
malone
was
the
first
to
speak
how
did
you
know
that
was
a
jack
of
clubs
he
said
in
a
strangled
sort
of
voice
the
little
old
lady
said
calmly
he
was
cheating
the
dealer
malone
asked
the
little
old
lady
nodded
in
favor
he
could
have
been
cheating
boyd
said
at
the
same
instant
why
would
he
want
to
give
you
all
that
money
the
little
old
lady
shook
her
head
he
did
want
to
give
it
to
me
she
said
he
wanted
to
give
it
to
the
man
in
the
cowboy
suit
his
name
is
elliott
by
the
way
bernard
elliott
and
he
comes
from
weehawken
but
he
pretends
to
be
a
westerner
so
nobody
will
be
suspicious
of
him
he
and
the
dealer
are
in
cahoots
is
that
the
word
yes
your
majesty
boyd
said
that
the
word
his
tone
was
awed
and
respectful
and
the
little
old
lady
gave
a
nod
and
became
queen
elizabeth
i
once
more
well
she
said
the
dealer
and
elliott
were
in
cahoots
and
the
dealer
wanted
to
give
the
hand
to
elliott
but
he
made
a
mistake
and
dealt
the
jack
of
clubs
to
me
i
watched
him
and
of
course
i
knew
what
he
was
thinking
the
rest
was
easy
my
god
malone
said
easy
barbara
said
did
she
win
she
won
malone
said
with
what
he
felt
was
positively
magnificent
understatement
good
barbara
said
and
lost
interest
at
once
malone
had
seen
the
lights
of
a
car
in
the
mirror
a
few
minutes
before
when
he
looked
now
the
lights
were
still
there
but
the
fact
just
did
register
until
a
couple
of
blocks
later
the
car
began
to
pull
around
them
on
the
left
it
was
a
buick
while
was
a
new
lincoln
but
the
edge
was
too
apparent
yet
malone
spotted
the
gun
barrel
protruding
from
the
buick
and
yelled
just
before
the
first
shot
went
off
boyd
at
the
wheel
did
even
bother
to
look
his
reflexes
took
over
and
he
slammed
his
foot
down
on
the
brake
the
fbi
lincoln
slowed
down
instantly
the
shotgun
blast
splattered
the
glass
of
the
curved
windshield
all
over
but
none
of
it
came
into
the
car
itself
malone
already
had
his
hand
on
the
butt
of
the
magnum
under
his
left
armpit
and
he
even
had
time
to
be
grateful
for
once
that
it
was
a
smallsword
the
women
were
in
the
back
seat
frozen
and
he
yelled
duck
damn
it
duck
and
felt
rather
than
saw
both
of
them
sink
down
onto
the
floor
of
the
car
the
buick
had
slowed
down
too
and
the
gun
barrel
was
swiveling
back
for
a
second
shot
malone
felt
naked
and
unprotected
the
buick
and
the
lincoln
were
even
on
the
road
now
malone
had
his
revolver
out
he
fired
the
first
shot
without
even
realizing
fully
that
he
done
so
and
he
heard
a
piercing
scream
from
barbara
in
the
back
seat
he
had
no
time
to
look
back
a
magnum
is
not
by
any
means
a
small
gun
as
handguns
go
revolvers
and
automatics
it
is
about
as
large
as
a
gun
can
get
to
be
an
ordinary
car
has
absolutely
no
chance
against
it
much
less
the
glass
in
an
ordinary
car
the
first
slug
drilled
its
way
through
the
window
glass
as
though
it
were
not
there
and
slammed
its
way
through
an
even
more
unprotected
obstacle
the
frontal
bones
of
the
triggerman
skull
the
second
slug
from
malone
gun
followed
it
right
away
and
missed
the
hole
the
first
slug
had
made
by
something
less
than
an
inch
the
big
apelike
thug
who
was
holding
the
shotgun
had
a
chance
to
pull
the
trigger
once
more
but
he
was
aiming
very
well
the
blast
merely
scored
the
paint
off
the
top
of
the
lincoln
the
rear
window
of
the
buick
was
open
and
malone
caught
sight
of
another
glint
of
blued
steel
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
there
was
no
time
to
shift
aim
not
with
bullets
flying
like
swallows
on
the
way
to
capistrano
malone
thought
faster
than
he
had
imagined
himself
capable
of
doing
and
decided
to
aim
for
the
driver
evidently
the
man
in
the
rear
seat
of
the
buick
had
had
the
same
inspiration
malone
blasted
two
more
lead
slugs
at
the
driver
of
the
big
buick
and
at
the
same
time
the
man
in
the
rear
seat
fired
at
boyd
but
boyd
had
shifted
tactics
he
hit
the
brakes
now
he
came
down
hard
on
the
accelerator
instead
the
chorus
of
shrieks
from
the
lincoln
back
seat
increased
slightly
in
volume
barbara
malone
knew
was
badly
hurt
she
had
even
stopped
for
breath
since
the
first
shot
had
been
fired
anybody
who
could
scream
like
that
he
told
himself
had
to
be
healthy
as
the
lincoln
leaped
ahead
malone
pulled
the
trigger
of
his
twice
more
the
heavy
chunks
of
streamlined
lead
leaped
from
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
and
slammed
into
the
driver
of
the
buick
without
wasting
any
time
the
buick
slewed
across
the
highway
the
two
shots
fired
by
the
man
in
the
back
seat
went
past
head
with
a
missing
both
him
and
boyd
by
a
margin
too
narrow
to
think
about
but
those
were
the
last
shots
the
only
difference
between
the
fbi
and
the
enemy
seemed
to
be
determination
and
practice
the
buick
spun
into
a
flat
sideskid
swiveled
on
its
wheels
and
slammed
into
the
ditch
at
the
side
of
the
road
turning
over
and
over
making
a
horrible
noise
as
it
broke
up
boyd
slowed
the
car
again
just
as
there
was
a
sudden
blast
of
fire
the
buick
had
burst
into
flame
and
was
spitting
heat
and
smoke
and
fire
in
all
directions
malone
sent
one
more
bullet
after
it
in
a
last
flurry
of
action
saving
his
last
one
for
possible
later
emergencies
boyd
jammed
on
the
brakes
and
the
lincoln
came
to
a
screaming
halt
in
silence
he
and
malone
watched
the
burning
buick
roll
over
and
over
into
the
desert
beyond
the
shoulder
my
god
boyd
said
my
ears
malone
understood
at
once
the
blast
from
his
own
had
roared
past
boyd
head
during
the
gun
battle
no
wonder
the
ears
hurt
it
was
a
wonder
he
was
altogether
deaf
but
boyd
shook
off
the
pain
and
brought
out
his
own
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
car
malone
followed
him
his
gun
trained
from
the
rear
her
majesty
said
it
safe
to
rise
now
is
it
you
ought
to
know
malone
said
you
can
tell
if
they
still
alive
there
was
silence
while
queen
elizabeth
frowned
for
a
moment
in
concentration
a
look
of
pain
crossed
her
face
and
then
as
her
expression
smoothed
again
she
said
the
traitors
are
dead
all
except
one
and
he
she
paused
he
dying
she
finished
he
ca
hurt
you
there
was
no
need
for
further
battle
malone
reholstered
his
and
turned
to
boyd
tom
call
the
state
police
he
said
get
down
here
fast
he
waited
while
boyd
climbed
back
under
the
wheel
and
began
punching
buttons
on
the
dashboard
then
malone
went
toward
the
burning
buick
he
tried
to
drag
the
men
out
but
it
was
any
use
the
first
two
in
the
front
seat
had
the
kind
of
holes
in
them
people
talked
about
throwing
elephants
through
head
and
chest
had
been
hit
malone
could
get
close
enough
to
the
fiercely
blazing
automobile
to
make
even
a
try
for
the
men
in
the
back
seat
he
was
sitting
quietly
on
the
edge
of
the
rear
seat
when
the
nevada
highway
patrol
cars
drove
up
next
to
them
barbara
wilson
had
stopped
screaming
but
she
was
still
sobbing
on
malone
shoulder
it
all
right
he
told
her
feeling
ineffectual
i
never
saw
anybody
killed
before
she
said
it
all
right
malone
said
nothing
going
to
hurt
you
protect
you
he
wondered
if
he
meant
it
and
found
to
his
surprise
that
he
did
barbara
wilson
sniffled
and
looked
up
at
him
malone
ken
he
said
i
sorry
she
said
ken
i
so
afraid
i
saw
the
hole
in
one
of
the
men
heads
when
you
fired
it
was
do
think
about
it
malone
said
to
him
the
job
had
been
an
unpleasant
occurrence
but
a
job
that
was
all
he
could
see
though
how
it
might
affect
people
who
were
new
to
it
you
so
brave
she
said
malone
tightened
his
arm
around
the
girl
shoulder
just
depend
on
me
he
said
you
be
all
right
if
you
the
state
trooper
walked
up
then
and
looked
at
them
mr
malone
he
said
he
seemed
to
be
taken
slightly
aback
at
the
costuming
that
right
malone
said
he
pulled
out
his
id
card
and
the
little
golden
badge
the
state
patrolman
looked
at
them
and
looked
back
at
malone
what
with
the
getup
he
said
fbi
malone
said
hoping
his
voice
carried
conviction
official
business
in
costume
never
mind
about
the
details
malone
snapped
he
an
fbi
agent
sir
barbara
said
and
what
are
you
the
patrolman
said
lady
jane
grey
i
a
nurse
barbara
said
a
psychiatric
nurse
for
nuts
for
disturbed
patients
the
patrolman
thought
that
over
hell
you
got
the
identity
cards
and
stuff
he
said
at
last
maybe
you
got
a
reason
to
dress
up
how
would
i
know
i
only
a
state
patrolman
let
cut
the
monologue
malone
said
savagely
and
get
to
business
the
patrolman
stared
then
he
said
all
right
sir
yes
sir
lieutenant
adams
malone
suppose
you
tell
me
what
happened
carefully
and
concisely
malone
told
him
the
story
of
the
buick
that
had
pulled
up
beside
them
and
what
happened
afterward
meanwhile
the
other
cops
had
been
looking
over
the
wreck
when
malone
had
finished
his
story
lieutenant
adams
flipped
his
notebook
shut
and
looked
over
toward
them
i
guess
it
okay
sir
he
said
as
far
as
i
concerned
it
justifiable
homicide
any
reason
why
they
want
to
kill
you
malone
thought
about
the
golden
palace
that
might
be
a
reason
but
it
might
not
and
why
burden
an
innocent
state
patrolman
with
the
facts
of
fbi
life
official
he
said
your
chief
will
get
the
report
the
patrolman
nodded
i
have
to
take
a
deposition
tomorrow
but
i
know
malone
said
thanks
can
we
go
on
to
our
hotel
now
i
guess
the
patrolman
said
go
ahead
we
take
care
of
the
rest
of
this
you
be
getting
a
call
later
fine
malone
said
trace
those
hoods
and
any
connections
they
might
have
had
get
the
information
to
me
as
soon
as
possible
lieutenant
adams
nodded
you
wo
have
to
leave
the
state
will
you
he
asked
i
do
mean
that
you
exactly
hell
fbi
but
it
be
easier
call
burris
in
washington
malone
said
he
can
get
hold
of
me
and
if
the
governor
wants
to
know
where
we
are
or
the
state
attorney
put
them
in
touch
with
burris
too
okay
okay
lieutenant
adams
said
sure
he
blinked
at
malone
listen
he
said
about
those
costumes
we
trying
to
catch
henry
viii
for
the
murder
of
anne
boleyn
malone
said
with
a
polite
smile
okay
i
was
only
asking
lieutenant
adams
said
ca
blame
a
man
for
asking
now
can
you
malone
climbed
into
his
front
seat
call
me
later
he
said
the
car
started
back
to
the
hotel
sir
thomas
malone
said
and
the
car
roared
off
yucca
flats
malone
thought
certainly
deserved
its
name
it
was
about
as
flat
as
land
could
get
and
it
contained
millions
upon
millions
of
useless
yuccas
perhaps
they
were
good
for
something
malone
thought
but
they
were
good
for
the
place
might
of
course
have
been
called
cactus
flats
but
the
cacti
were
neither
as
big
nor
as
impressive
as
the
yuccas
or
was
that
yucci
possibly
malone
mused
it
was
simply
yucks
and
whatever
it
was
there
were
millions
of
it
malone
felt
he
could
stand
the
sight
of
another
yucca
he
was
grateful
for
only
one
thing
it
was
summer
if
the
elizabethans
had
been
forced
to
drive
in
closed
cars
through
the
nevada
desert
in
the
summertime
they
might
have
started
a
cult
of
nudity
malone
felt
it
was
bad
enough
now
in
what
was
supposed
to
be
winter
the
sun
was
certainly
bright
enough
for
one
thing
it
glared
through
the
cloudless
sky
and
glanced
with
blinding
force
off
the
road
sir
thomas
boyd
squinted
at
it
through
the
rather
incongruous
sunglasses
he
was
wearing
while
malone
wondered
idly
if
it
was
the
sunglasses
or
the
rest
of
the
world
that
was
an
anachronism
but
sir
thomas
kept
his
eyes
grimly
on
the
road
as
he
gunned
the
powerful
lincoln
toward
the
yucca
flats
labs
at
eighty
miles
an
hour
malone
twisted
himself
around
and
faced
the
women
in
the
back
seat
past
them
through
the
rear
window
of
the
lincoln
he
could
see
the
second
car
it
followed
them
gamely
carrying
the
newest
addition
to
sir
kenneth
malone
collection
of
bats
bats
her
majesty
said
suddenly
but
gently
shame
on
you
sir
kenneth
these
are
poor
sick
people
we
must
do
our
best
to
help
them
not
to
think
up
silly
names
for
them
for
shame
i
suppose
so
malone
said
wearily
he
sighed
and
for
the
fifth
time
that
day
he
asked
does
your
majesty
have
any
idea
where
our
spy
is
now
well
really
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
with
the
slightest
of
hesitations
it
is
easy
you
know
telepathy
has
certain
laws
just
like
everything
else
after
all
even
a
game
has
laws
being
telepathic
did
help
me
to
play
poker
i
still
had
to
learn
the
rules
and
telepathy
has
rules
too
a
telepath
can
easily
confuse
another
telepath
by
using
some
of
those
rules
oh
fine
malone
said
well
have
you
got
into
contact
with
his
mind
yet
oh
yes
her
majesty
said
happily
and
my
goodness
he
certainly
digging
up
a
lot
of
information
is
he
malone
moaned
softly
but
who
he
he
asked
after
a
second
the
queen
stared
at
the
roof
of
the
car
in
what
looked
like
concentration
he
has
thought
of
his
name
yet
she
said
i
mean
at
least
if
he
has
he
has
mentioned
it
to
me
really
sir
kenneth
you
have
no
idea
how
difficult
all
this
is
malone
swallowed
with
difficulty
is
he
then
said
can
you
tell
me
that
at
least
his
location
her
majesty
looked
positively
desolated
with
sadness
i
ca
be
sure
she
said
i
really
ca
be
exactly
sure
just
where
he
is
he
does
keep
moving
around
i
know
that
but
you
have
to
remember
that
he
does
want
me
to
find
him
he
certainly
does
want
to
be
found
by
the
fbi
would
you
your
majesty
malone
said
i
the
fbi
yes
the
queen
said
but
suppose
you
were
he
doing
his
best
to
hide
himself
even
from
me
it
sort
of
a
game
he
playing
a
game
her
majesty
looked
contrite
believe
me
sir
kenneth
the
minute
i
know
exactly
where
he
is
i
tell
you
i
promise
cross
my
heart
and
hope
to
die
which
i
ca
of
course
being
immortal
nevertheless
she
made
an
over
her
left
breast
all
right
all
right
malone
said
out
of
sheer
necessity
okay
but
waste
any
time
telling
me
do
it
right
away
we
to
find
that
spy
and
isolate
him
somehow
please
do
worry
yourself
sir
kenneth
her
majesty
said
your
queen
is
doing
everything
she
can
i
know
that
your
majesty
malone
said
i
sure
of
it
privately
he
wondered
just
how
much
even
she
could
do
then
he
realized
for
perhaps
the
time
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
wondering
privately
any
more
that
quite
right
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
sweetly
and
about
time
you
got
used
to
it
what
going
on
boyd
said
more
reading
minds
back
there
that
right
sir
thomas
the
queen
said
i
about
gotten
used
to
it
boyd
said
almost
cheerfully
pretty
soon
they
come
and
take
me
away
but
i
do
mind
at
all
he
whipped
the
car
around
a
bend
in
the
road
savagely
pretty
soon
they
put
me
with
the
other
sane
people
and
let
the
bats
inherit
the
world
but
i
do
mind
at
all
sir
thomas
her
majesty
said
in
shocked
tones
please
boyd
said
with
a
deceptive
calmness
just
boyd
not
even
lieutenant
boyd
or
sergeant
boyd
just
boyd
or
if
you
prefer
tom
sir
thomas
her
majesty
said
i
really
ca
understand
this
sudden
then
do
understand
it
boyd
said
all
i
know
is
nuts
and
i
sick
and
tired
of
it
a
pall
of
silence
fell
over
the
company
look
tom
malone
began
at
last
do
you
try
smoothing
me
down
boyd
snapped
malone
eyebrows
rose
okay
he
said
i
wo
smooth
you
down
i
just
tell
you
to
shut
up
to
keep
driving
and
to
show
some
respect
to
her
majesty
i
boyd
stopped
there
was
a
second
of
silence
better
her
majesty
said
with
satisfaction
lady
barbara
stretched
in
the
back
seat
next
to
her
majesty
this
is
certainly
a
long
drive
she
said
have
we
got
much
farther
to
go
not
too
far
malone
said
we
ought
to
be
there
soon
i
i
sorry
for
the
way
i
acted
barbara
said
what
do
you
mean
the
way
you
acted
crying
like
that
barbara
said
with
some
hesitation
making
an
absolute
idiot
of
myself
when
that
other
car
tried
to
get
us
do
worry
about
it
malone
said
it
was
nothing
i
just
made
trouble
for
you
barbara
said
her
majesty
touched
the
girl
on
the
shoulder
he
not
thinking
about
the
trouble
you
cause
him
she
said
quietly
of
course
i
not
malone
told
her
but
i
my
dear
girl
her
majesty
said
i
believe
that
sir
kenneth
is
at
least
partly
in
love
with
you
malone
blinked
it
was
perfectly
true
even
if
he
had
quite
known
it
himself
until
now
telepaths
he
was
discovering
were
occasionally
handy
things
to
have
around
in
love
barbara
said
and
you
my
dear
her
majesty
began
please
your
majesty
lady
barbara
said
no
more
not
just
now
the
queen
smiled
almost
to
herself
certainly
dear
she
said
the
car
sped
on
in
the
distance
malone
could
see
the
blot
on
the
desert
that
indicated
the
broad
expanse
of
yucca
flats
labs
just
the
fact
that
it
could
be
seen
he
knew
did
mean
an
awful
lot
malone
had
been
able
to
see
it
for
the
past
fifteen
minutes
and
it
look
as
if
they
gained
an
inch
on
it
desert
distances
are
deceptive
at
long
last
however
the
main
gate
of
the
laboratories
hove
into
view
boyd
made
a
left
turn
off
the
highway
and
drove
a
full
seven
miles
along
the
restricted
road
right
up
to
the
big
gate
that
marked
the
entrance
of
the
laboratories
themselves
once
again
they
were
faced
with
the
army
of
suspicious
guards
and
security
officers
this
time
suspicion
was
somewhat
heightened
by
the
dress
of
the
visitors
malone
had
to
explain
about
six
times
that
the
costumes
were
part
of
an
fbi
arrangement
that
he
had
not
stolen
his
identity
cards
that
boyd
cards
were
boyd
too
and
in
general
that
the
four
of
them
were
not
insane
not
spies
and
not
jokesters
out
for
a
lark
in
the
sunshine
malone
had
expected
all
of
that
he
went
through
the
rigmarole
wearily
but
without
any
sense
of
surprise
the
one
thing
he
been
expecting
was
the
man
who
was
waiting
for
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
when
he
finished
identifying
everybody
for
the
fifth
or
sixth
time
he
began
to
climb
back
into
the
car
a
familiar
voice
stopped
him
cold
just
a
minute
malone
andrew
burris
said
he
erupted
from
the
guardhouse
like
an
avenging
angel
followed
closely
by
a
thin
man
about
five
feet
ten
inches
in
height
with
brown
hair
round
spectacles
large
hands
and
a
small
sir
francis
drake
beard
malone
looked
at
the
two
figures
blankly
something
wrong
chief
he
said
burris
came
toward
the
car
the
thin
gentleman
followed
him
walking
with
an
odd
bouncing
step
that
must
have
been
acquired
malone
thought
over
years
of
treading
on
rubber
eggs
i
do
know
burris
said
when
he
reached
the
door
when
i
was
in
washington
i
seemed
to
know
but
when
i
get
out
here
in
this
desert
everything
just
goes
haywire
he
rubbed
at
his
forehead
then
he
looked
into
the
car
hello
boyd
he
said
pleasantly
hello
chief
boyd
said
burris
blinked
boyd
you
look
like
henry
viii
he
said
with
only
the
faintest
trace
of
surprise
does
he
though
her
majesty
said
from
the
rear
seat
noticed
that
resemblance
myself
burris
gave
her
a
tiny
smile
oh
he
said
hello
your
majesty
i
andrew
burris
director
of
the
fbi
the
queen
finished
for
him
yes
i
know
it
very
nice
to
meet
you
at
last
i
seen
you
on
television
and
over
the
video
phone
you
photograph
badly
you
know
i
do
burris
said
pleasantly
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
keeping
himself
under
very
tight
control
malone
felt
remotely
sorry
for
the
man
but
only
remotely
burris
might
as
well
know
he
thought
what
they
had
all
been
going
through
the
past
several
days
her
majesty
was
saying
something
about
the
honorable
estate
of
knighthood
and
the
queen
list
malone
began
paying
attention
when
she
came
to
and
i
hereby
dub
thee
she
stopped
suddenly
turned
and
said
sir
kenneth
give
me
your
weapon
malone
hesitated
for
a
long
long
second
but
burris
eye
was
on
him
and
he
could
interpret
the
look
without
much
trouble
there
was
only
one
thing
for
him
to
do
he
pulled
out
his
ejected
the
cartridges
in
his
palm
and
reminded
himself
to
reload
the
gun
as
soon
as
he
got
it
back
and
handed
the
weapon
to
the
queen
butt
foremost
she
took
the
butt
of
the
revolver
in
her
right
hand
leaned
out
the
window
of
the
car
and
said
in
a
fine
distinct
voice
kneel
andrew
malone
watched
with
wide
astonished
eyes
as
andrew
burris
director
of
the
fbi
went
to
one
knee
in
a
low
and
solemn
genuflection
queen
elizabeth
thompson
nodded
her
satisfaction
she
tapped
burris
gently
on
each
shoulder
with
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
i
knight
thee
sir
andrew
she
said
she
cleared
her
throat
my
this
desert
air
is
dry
rise
sir
andrew
and
know
that
you
are
henceforth
knight
commander
of
the
queen
own
fbi
thank
you
your
majesty
burris
said
humbly
he
rose
to
his
feet
silently
the
queen
withdrew
into
the
car
again
and
handed
the
gun
back
to
malone
he
thumbed
the
cartridges
into
the
chambers
of
the
cylinder
and
listened
dumbly
your
majesty
burris
said
this
is
harry
gamble
the
head
of
project
isle
gamble
this
is
her
majesty
the
queen
lady
barbara
wilson
her
uh
her
sir
kenneth
malone
and
king
i
mean
sir
thomas
boyd
he
gave
the
four
a
single
bright
impartial
smile
then
he
tore
his
eyes
away
from
the
others
and
bent
his
gaze
on
sir
kenneth
malone
come
over
here
a
minute
malone
he
said
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
i
want
to
talk
to
you
malone
climbed
out
of
the
car
and
went
around
to
meet
burris
he
felt
just
a
little
worried
as
he
followed
the
director
away
from
the
car
true
he
had
sent
burris
a
long
telegram
the
night
before
in
code
but
he
had
expected
the
man
to
show
up
in
yucca
flats
there
seem
to
be
any
reason
for
it
and
when
there
is
any
reason
malone
told
himself
sagely
it
a
bad
one
what
the
trouble
chief
he
asked
burris
sighed
none
so
far
he
said
quietly
i
got
a
report
from
the
nevada
state
patrol
and
ran
it
through
r
i
they
identified
the
men
you
killed
all
right
but
it
did
do
us
any
good
they
hired
hoods
who
hired
them
malone
said
burris
shrugged
somebody
with
money
he
said
hell
men
like
that
would
kill
their
own
grandmothers
if
the
price
were
right
you
know
that
we
ca
trace
them
back
any
farther
malone
nodded
that
was
he
had
to
admit
bad
news
but
then
when
had
he
last
had
any
good
news
we
nowhere
near
our
telepathic
spy
burris
said
we
have
come
any
closer
than
we
were
when
we
started
have
you
got
anything
anything
at
all
no
matter
how
small
not
that
i
know
of
sir
malone
said
what
about
the
little
old
lady
what
her
name
thompson
anything
from
her
malone
hesitated
she
has
a
close
fix
on
the
spy
sir
he
said
slowly
but
she
does
seem
able
to
identify
him
right
away
what
else
does
she
want
burris
said
we
made
her
queen
and
given
her
a
full
retinue
in
costume
we
let
her
play
roulette
and
poker
with
government
money
does
she
want
to
hold
a
mass
execution
if
she
does
i
can
supply
some
congressmen
malone
i
sure
it
could
be
arranged
he
looked
at
the
agent
narrowly
i
might
even
be
able
to
supply
an
fbi
man
or
two
he
added
malone
swallowed
hard
i
trying
the
best
i
can
sir
he
said
what
about
the
others
burris
looked
even
unhappier
than
usual
come
along
he
said
show
you
when
they
got
back
to
the
car
gamble
was
talking
spiritedly
with
her
majesty
about
roger
bacon
before
my
time
of
course
the
queen
was
saying
but
i
sure
he
was
a
most
interesting
man
now
when
dear
old
marlowe
wrote
his
he
and
i
had
several
long
discussions
about
such
matters
alchemy
doctor
burris
interrupted
with
i
beg
your
pardon
your
majesty
but
we
must
get
on
perhaps
you
be
able
to
continue
your
ah
audience
later
he
turned
to
boyd
sir
thomas
he
said
with
an
effort
drive
directly
to
the
westinghouse
buildings
over
that
way
he
pointed
gamble
will
ride
with
you
and
the
rest
of
us
will
follow
in
the
second
car
let
move
he
stepped
back
as
the
project
head
got
into
the
car
and
watched
it
roar
off
then
he
and
malone
went
to
the
second
car
another
fbi
lincoln
two
agents
were
sitting
in
the
back
seat
with
a
still
figure
between
them
with
a
shock
malone
recognized
william
logan
and
the
agents
detailed
to
watch
the
telepath
logan
face
did
not
seem
to
have
changed
expression
since
malone
had
seen
it
last
and
he
wondered
wildly
if
perhaps
it
had
to
be
dusted
once
a
week
he
got
in
behind
the
wheel
and
burris
slid
in
next
to
him
westinghouse
burris
said
and
let
get
there
in
a
hurry
right
malone
said
and
started
the
car
we
just
have
had
a
single
lead
burris
said
i
was
hoping
come
up
with
something
your
telegram
detailed
the
fight
of
course
and
the
rest
of
what
been
happening
but
i
hoped
there
be
something
more
there
is
malone
was
forced
to
admit
all
we
can
do
is
try
to
persuade
her
majesty
to
tell
us
oh
i
know
it
is
easy
burris
said
but
it
seems
to
me
by
the
time
they
arrived
at
the
administrative
offices
of
westinghouse
psionics
research
area
malone
found
himself
wishing
that
something
would
happen
possibly
he
thought
lightning
might
strike
or
an
earthquake
swallow
everything
up
he
was
suddenly
profoundly
tired
of
the
entire
affair
four
days
later
he
was
more
than
tired
he
was
exhausted
the
six
psychopaths
including
her
majesty
queen
elizabeth
i
had
been
housed
in
a
converted
dormitory
in
the
westinghouse
area
together
with
four
highly
nervous
and
even
more
highly
trained
and
investigated
psychiatrists
from
elizabeths
in
washington
the
convention
of
nuts
as
malone
called
it
privately
was
in
full
swing
and
it
was
every
bit
as
strange
as
he
thought
it
was
going
to
be
unfortunately
five
of
the
six
her
majesty
being
the
only
exception
were
completely
out
of
contact
with
the
world
the
psychiatrists
referred
to
them
in
worried
tones
as
unavailable
for
therapy
and
spent
most
of
their
time
brooding
over
possible
ways
of
bringing
them
back
into
the
real
world
for
a
while
at
least
far
enough
so
that
they
could
be
spoken
with
malone
stayed
away
from
the
five
who
were
completely
psychotic
the
weird
babblings
of
barry
miles
disconcerted
him
they
sounded
like
little
charlie
strange
jabber
but
westinghouse
said
that
it
seemed
to
represent
another
phenomenon
entirely
william
logan
blank
face
was
a
memory
of
horror
but
the
constant
tinkling
giggles
of
ardith
parker
the
studied
and
concentrated
way
that
gordon
macklin
wove
meaningless
patterns
in
the
air
with
his
waving
fingers
and
the
rhythmless
melodyless
humming
that
seemed
to
be
all
there
was
to
the
personality
of
robert
cassiday
were
simply
too
much
for
malone
taken
singly
each
was
frightening
and
remote
all
together
they
wove
a
picture
of
insanity
that
chilled
him
more
than
he
wanted
to
admit
when
the
seventh
telepath
was
flown
in
from
honolulu
malone
even
bother
to
see
her
he
let
the
psychiatrists
take
over
directly
and
simply
avoided
their
sessions
queen
elizabeth
i
on
the
other
hand
he
found
genuinely
likeable
according
to
the
psych
boys
she
had
been
as
both
malone
and
her
majesty
had
theorized
heavily
frustrated
by
being
the
possessor
of
a
talent
which
no
one
else
recognized
beyond
that
the
impact
of
other
minds
was
disturbing
there
was
a
slight
loss
of
identity
which
seemed
to
be
a
major
factor
in
every
case
of
telepathic
insanity
but
the
queen
had
compensated
for
her
frustrations
in
the
easiest
possible
way
she
had
simply
traded
her
identity
for
another
one
and
had
rationalized
a
single
overruling
delusion
that
she
was
queen
elizabeth
i
of
england
still
alive
and
wrongfully
deprived
of
her
throne
it
a
beautiful
rationalization
one
of
the
psychiatrists
said
with
more
than
a
trace
of
admiration
in
his
voice
complete
and
thoroughly
consistent
she
just
traded
identities
and
everything
else
she
does
else
stems
logically
out
of
her
delusional
premise
beautiful
she
may
have
been
crazy
malone
realized
but
she
was
a
long
way
from
stupid
the
project
was
in
full
swing
the
only
trouble
was
that
they
were
no
nearer
finding
the
telepath
than
they
had
been
three
weeks
before
with
five
completely
blank
human
beings
to
work
with
and
the
sixth
queen
elizabeth
malone
heard
privately
that
the
last
telepath
the
girl
from
honolulu
was
no
better
than
the
first
five
she
had
apparently
regressed
into
what
one
of
the
psychiatrists
called
a
identity
childhood
syndrome
malone
did
know
what
it
meant
but
it
sounded
terrible
with
that
crew
malone
could
see
why
progress
was
their
most
difficult
commodity
harry
gamble
the
head
of
project
isle
was
losing
poundage
by
the
hour
with
worry
and
malone
reflected
he
could
ill
afford
it
burris
malone
and
boyd
had
set
themselves
up
in
a
temporary
office
within
the
westinghouse
area
the
director
had
left
his
assistant
in
charge
in
washington
nothing
he
said
over
and
over
again
was
as
important
as
the
spy
in
project
isle
apparently
boyd
had
come
to
believe
that
too
at
any
rate
though
he
was
still
truculent
there
were
no
more
outbursts
of
rebellion
but
on
the
fourth
day
what
do
we
do
now
burris
asked
shoot
ourselves
boyd
said
promptly
now
look
here
malone
began
but
he
was
overruled
boyd
burris
said
levelly
if
i
hear
any
more
of
that
sort
of
pessimism
you
going
to
be
an
exception
to
the
beard
rule
one
more
crack
out
of
you
and
you
can
go
out
and
buy
yourself
a
razor
boyd
put
his
hand
over
his
chin
protectively
and
said
nothing
at
all
wait
a
minute
malone
said
are
there
any
telepaths
in
the
world
we
ca
find
any
burris
said
we
there
was
a
knock
at
the
office
door
who
there
burris
called
gamble
said
the
man
surprisingly
baritone
voice
burris
called
come
in
doctor
and
the
door
opened
lean
face
looked
almost
haggard
burris
he
said
extending
his
arms
a
trifle
ca
anything
be
done
malone
had
seen
gamble
speaking
before
and
had
wondered
if
it
would
be
possible
for
the
man
to
talk
with
his
hands
tied
behind
his
back
apparently
it
would
be
we
feel
that
we
are
approaching
a
critical
stage
in
project
isle
the
scientist
said
enclosing
one
fist
within
the
other
hand
if
anything
more
gets
out
to
the
soviets
we
might
as
well
publish
our
findings
a
wide
outflung
gesture
of
both
arms
in
the
newspapers
burris
stepped
back
we
doing
the
best
we
can
gamble
he
said
all
things
considered
his
obvious
try
at
radiating
confidence
was
nearly
successful
after
all
he
went
on
we
know
a
great
deal
more
than
we
did
four
days
ago
miss
thompson
has
assured
us
that
the
spy
is
right
here
within
the
compound
of
yucca
flats
labs
bottled
everything
up
in
this
compound
and
i
confident
that
no
information
is
at
present
getting
through
to
the
soviet
government
miss
thompson
agrees
with
me
miss
thompson
gamble
said
one
hand
at
his
bearded
chin
the
queen
burris
said
gamble
nodded
and
two
fingers
touched
his
forehead
ah
he
said
of
course
he
rubbed
at
the
back
of
his
neck
but
we
ca
keep
everybody
who
here
now
locked
up
forever
sooner
or
later
we
have
to
let
them
his
left
hand
described
the
gesture
of
a
man
tossing
away
a
wad
of
paper
go
his
hands
fell
to
his
sides
we
lost
unless
we
can
find
that
spy
we
find
him
burris
said
with
a
show
of
great
confidence
but
give
her
time
burris
said
give
her
time
remember
her
mental
condition
boyd
looked
up
rome
he
said
in
an
absent
fashion
was
built
in
a
daze
burris
glared
at
him
but
said
nothing
malone
filled
the
conversational
hole
with
what
he
thought
would
be
nice
and
hopeful
and
untrue
we
know
he
someone
on
the
reservation
so
we
catch
him
eventually
he
said
and
as
long
as
his
information
is
getting
into
soviet
hands
we
safe
he
glanced
at
his
wristwatch
gamble
said
but
my
my
malone
said
almost
lunchtime
i
have
to
go
over
and
have
lunch
with
her
majesty
maybe
she
dug
up
something
more
i
hope
so
gamble
said
apparently
successfully
deflected
i
do
hope
so
well
malone
said
pardon
me
he
shucked
off
his
coat
and
trousers
then
he
proceeded
to
put
on
the
doublet
and
hose
that
hung
in
the
little
office
closet
he
shrugged
into
the
sleeved
coat
adjusted
the
plumed
hat
to
his
satisfaction
with
great
care
and
gave
burris
and
the
others
a
small
bow
i
go
to
an
audience
with
her
majesty
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
grave
voice
i
shall
return
anon
he
went
out
the
door
and
closed
it
carefully
behind
him
when
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
he
allowed
himself
the
luxury
of
a
deep
sigh
then
he
went
outside
and
across
the
dusty
street
to
the
barracks
where
her
majesty
and
the
other
telepaths
were
housed
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
and
he
rather
missed
the
stares
he
become
used
to
drawing
but
by
now
everybody
was
used
to
seeing
elizabethan
clothing
her
majesty
had
arrived
at
a
new
plateau
she
would
now
allow
no
one
to
have
audience
with
her
unless
he
was
properly
dressed
even
the
psychiatrists
whom
she
had
with
a
careful
sense
of
meiosis
appointed
physicians
to
the
royal
house
had
to
wear
the
stuff
malone
went
over
the
whole
case
in
his
mind
for
about
the
thousandth
time
he
told
himself
bitterly
who
could
the
telepathic
spy
be
it
was
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
rolling
stone
he
thought
or
something
he
did
remember
clearly
that
a
stitch
in
time
saved
nine
but
he
did
know
nine
what
and
suspected
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
present
problem
how
about
harry
gamble
malone
thought
it
seemed
a
little
unlikely
that
the
head
of
project
isle
would
be
spying
on
his
own
men
particularly
since
he
already
had
all
the
information
but
on
the
other
hand
he
was
just
as
probable
a
spy
as
anybody
else
malone
moved
onward
thomas
the
westinghouse
psionics
man
was
the
next
nominee
before
malone
had
actually
found
her
majesty
he
had
had
a
suspicion
that
had
cooked
the
whole
thing
up
to
throw
the
fbi
off
the
trail
and
confuse
everybody
and
that
he
intended
merely
to
have
the
fbi
chase
ghosts
while
the
real
spy
did
his
work
undetected
but
what
if
were
the
spy
himself
a
telepath
what
if
he
were
so
confident
of
his
ability
to
throw
the
queen
off
the
track
that
he
had
allowed
the
fbi
to
find
all
the
other
telepaths
there
was
another
argument
for
that
he
had
to
report
the
findings
of
his
machine
no
matter
what
it
cost
him
there
were
too
many
other
men
on
his
staff
who
knew
about
it
was
a
perfectly
plausible
spy
too
but
he
did
seem
very
likely
the
head
of
a
government
project
is
likely
to
be
a
investigated
man
could
any
with
russia
even
a
psionic
one
stand
up
against
that
kind
of
investigation
it
was
possible
anything
after
all
was
possible
you
eliminated
the
impossible
and
then
whatever
remained
however
improbable
malone
told
himself
morosely
to
shut
up
and
think
he
told
himself
might
be
the
spy
it
would
be
a
pleasure
he
realized
to
go
to
the
office
of
that
superior
scientist
and
arrest
him
i
know
your
true
name
he
muttered
it
is
moriarty
he
wondered
if
the
westinghouse
man
had
ever
done
any
work
on
the
dynamics
of
an
asteroid
then
he
wondered
what
the
dynamics
of
an
asteroid
were
but
if
were
the
spy
nothing
made
sense
why
would
he
have
disclosed
the
fact
that
people
were
having
their
minds
read
in
the
first
place
sadly
malone
gave
up
the
idea
but
then
there
were
other
ideas
the
other
psychiatrists
for
instance
the
only
trouble
with
them
malone
realized
was
that
there
seemed
to
be
neither
motive
nor
anything
else
to
connect
them
to
the
case
there
was
no
evidence
none
in
any
direction
why
there
was
just
as
much
evidence
that
the
spy
was
really
kenneth
malone
he
told
himself
and
then
he
stopped
maybe
tom
boyd
had
been
thinking
that
way
about
him
maybe
boyd
suspected
that
he
malone
was
really
the
spy
certainly
it
worked
in
reverse
boyd
no
malone
told
himself
firmly
that
was
silly
if
he
were
going
to
consider
boyd
he
realized
he
might
as
well
go
whole
hog
and
think
about
andrew
burris
and
that
really
ridiculous
absolutely
ridic
well
queen
elizabeth
had
seemed
pretty
certain
when
she
pointed
him
out
in
dowson
office
and
the
fact
that
she
apparently
changed
her
mind
did
have
to
mean
very
much
after
all
how
much
faith
could
you
place
in
her
majesty
at
the
best
of
times
if
she
made
a
mistake
about
burris
in
the
first
place
she
could
just
as
well
have
made
a
mistake
in
the
second
place
or
about
the
spy
being
at
yucca
flats
at
all
in
which
case
malone
thought
sadly
they
were
right
back
where
started
from
behind
their
own
goal
line
one
way
or
another
though
her
majesty
had
made
a
mistake
pointed
burris
out
as
the
spy
and
then
she
said
she
been
wrong
either
burris
was
a
spy
or
else
he
was
you
could
have
it
both
ways
and
if
burris
really
were
the
spy
malone
thought
then
why
had
he
started
the
investigation
in
the
first
place
you
came
back
to
the
same
question
with
burris
he
realized
that
you
had
with
it
did
make
sense
for
a
man
to
play
one
hand
against
the
other
maybe
the
right
hand
sometimes
did
know
what
the
left
hand
was
doing
but
this
was
ridiculous
so
burris
was
the
spy
and
her
majesty
had
made
a
mistake
when
she
said
wait
a
minute
malone
told
himself
suddenly
had
she
maybe
after
all
you
have
it
both
ways
the
thought
occurred
to
him
with
a
startling
suddenness
and
he
stood
silent
upon
a
peak
in
yucca
flats
contemplating
it
a
second
went
by
and
then
something
burris
himself
had
said
came
back
to
him
something
that
i
be
damned
he
muttered
he
came
to
a
dead
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
street
in
one
sudden
flash
of
insight
all
the
pieces
of
the
case
he
been
looking
at
for
so
long
fell
together
and
formed
one
consistent
picture
the
pattern
was
complete
malone
blinked
in
that
second
he
knew
exactly
who
the
spy
was
a
jeep
honked
raucously
and
swerved
around
him
the
driver
leaned
out
to
curse
and
malone
waved
at
him
dimly
recognizing
a
private
eye
he
had
once
known
a
man
named
archer
wondering
vaguely
what
archer
was
doing
this
far
east
and
in
a
jeep
at
that
malone
watched
the
vehicle
disappear
down
the
street
there
were
more
cars
coming
but
what
difference
did
that
make
malone
did
care
about
cars
after
all
he
had
the
answer
the
whole
answer
i
be
damned
he
said
again
abruptly
and
wheeled
around
to
head
back
to
the
offices
on
the
way
he
stopped
in
at
another
small
office
this
one
inhabited
by
the
two
fbi
men
from
las
vegas
he
gave
a
series
of
quick
orders
and
got
the
satisfaction
as
he
left
of
seeing
one
of
the
fbi
men
grabbing
for
a
phone
in
a
hurry
it
was
good
to
be
things
again
important
things
burris
boyd
and
gamble
were
still
talking
as
malone
entered
that
burris
said
was
one
hell
of
a
quick
lunch
what
her
majesty
doing
now
running
a
diner
malone
ignored
the
bait
and
drew
himself
to
his
full
height
gentlemen
he
said
solemnly
her
majesty
has
asked
that
all
of
us
attend
her
in
audience
she
has
information
of
the
utmost
gravity
to
impart
and
wishes
this
audience
at
once
gamble
made
a
puzzled
circular
gesture
with
one
hand
what
the
matter
he
asked
is
something
the
hand
dropped
wrong
burris
barely
glanced
at
him
a
startled
expression
came
over
his
features
has
she
he
began
and
stopped
leaving
his
mouth
open
and
the
rest
of
the
sentence
unfinished
malone
nodded
gravely
and
drew
in
a
breath
elizabethan
periods
were
hard
on
the
lungs
he
had
begun
to
realize
you
needed
a
lot
of
air
before
you
embarked
on
a
sentence
i
believe
gentlemen
he
said
that
her
majesty
is
about
to
reveal
the
identity
of
the
spy
who
has
been
battening
on
project
isle
the
silence
lasted
no
more
than
three
seconds
gamble
did
even
make
a
gesture
during
that
time
then
burris
spoke
let
go
he
snapped
he
wheeled
and
headed
for
the
door
the
others
promptly
followed
gentlemen
malone
said
sounding
as
far
as
he
could
tell
properly
shocked
and
offended
your
dress
what
gamble
said
throwing
up
both
hands
oh
boyd
chimed
in
not
now
burris
simply
said
you
quite
right
get
dressed
boyd
i
mean
of
course
sir
thomas
while
they
were
dressing
malone
put
in
a
call
to
office
the
scientist
was
as
frosty
as
ever
yes
mr
malone
the
sound
of
that
voice
malone
reflected
was
enough
to
give
anybody
double
revolving
pneumonia
with
knobs
on
he
said
her
majesty
wants
you
in
her
court
in
ten
minutes
and
in
full
court
dress
merely
sighed
like
boreas
what
is
this
he
asked
more
tomfoolery
i
really
could
say
malone
told
him
coyly
but
i
advise
you
to
be
there
it
might
interest
you
interest
me
stormed
i
got
work
to
do
here
important
work
you
simply
do
not
realize
malone
whatever
i
realize
malone
cut
in
feeling
brave
i
passing
on
orders
from
her
majesty
that
insane
woman
stated
flatly
is
not
going
to
order
me
about
good
lord
do
you
know
what
you
saying
malone
nodded
i
certainly
do
he
said
cheerfully
if
you
rather
i
can
have
the
orders
backed
up
by
the
united
states
government
but
that
wo
be
necessary
will
it
the
united
states
government
said
thawing
perceptibly
about
the
edges
ought
to
allow
a
man
to
do
his
proper
work
and
not
force
him
to
go
chasing
off
after
the
latest
whims
of
some
insane
old
lady
you
will
be
there
now
wo
you
malone
asked
his
own
voice
reminded
him
of
something
and
in
a
second
he
had
it
the
cooing
gentle
persuasion
of
andrew
blake
of
rice
pavilion
who
had
locked
malone
in
a
padded
cell
it
was
the
voice
of
a
man
talking
to
a
mental
case
it
sounded
remarkably
apt
went
slightly
purple
but
controlled
himself
magnificently
i
be
there
he
said
good
malone
told
him
and
snapped
the
phone
off
then
he
put
in
a
second
call
to
the
psychiatrists
from
elizabeths
and
told
them
the
same
thing
more
used
to
the
strange
demands
of
neurotic
and
psychotic
patients
they
were
readier
to
comply
everyone
malone
realized
with
satisfaction
was
now
assembling
burris
and
the
others
were
ready
to
go
sparklingly
dressed
and
looking
impatient
malone
put
down
the
phone
and
took
one
great
breath
of
relief
then
beaming
he
led
the
others
out
ten
minutes
later
there
were
nine
men
in
elizabethan
costume
standing
outside
the
room
which
had
been
designated
as
the
queen
court
gamble
costume
did
not
quite
fit
him
his
were
half
way
up
to
his
elbows
and
his
doublet
had
an
unfortunate
tendency
to
creep
the
elizabeths
men
all
four
of
them
looked
just
a
little
like
versions
of
old
silent
pictures
malone
looked
them
over
with
a
somewhat
sardonic
eye
not
only
did
he
have
the
answer
to
the
whole
problem
that
had
been
plaguing
them
but
costume
was
a
stunning
perfect
fit
now
i
want
you
men
to
let
me
handle
this
malone
said
i
know
just
what
i
want
to
say
and
i
think
i
can
get
the
information
without
too
much
trouble
one
of
the
psychiatrists
spoke
up
i
trust
you
wo
disturb
the
patient
malone
he
said
sir
kenneth
malone
snapped
the
psychiatrist
looked
both
abashed
and
worried
i
sorry
he
said
doubtfully
malone
nodded
that
all
right
he
said
i
try
not
to
disturb
her
majesty
unduly
the
psychiatrists
conferred
when
they
came
out
of
the
huddle
one
of
them
malone
was
never
able
to
tell
them
apart
said
very
well
we
let
you
handle
it
but
we
will
be
forced
to
interfere
if
we
feel
you
ah
going
too
far
malone
said
that
fair
enough
gentlemen
let
go
he
opened
the
door
it
was
a
magnificent
room
the
whole
place
had
been
done
over
in
plastic
and
synthetic
fibers
to
look
like
something
out
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
was
as
garish
and
as
perfect
as
a
hollywood
movie
set
which
was
surprising
since
two
stage
designers
had
been
hired
away
from
spectaculars
to
set
it
up
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
past
the
rich
hangings
and
the
flaming
chandeliers
was
a
great
throne
and
on
it
her
majesty
was
seated
lady
barbara
reclined
on
the
steps
at
her
feet
malone
saw
the
expression
on
her
majesty
face
he
wanted
to
talk
to
barbara
but
there
was
time
later
there
might
be
now
he
collected
his
mind
and
drove
one
thought
at
the
queen
one
single
powerful
thought
me
you
know
by
this
time
that
i
have
the
read
deeper
the
expression
on
her
face
changed
suddenly
she
was
smiling
a
sad
gentle
little
smile
lady
barbara
who
had
looked
up
at
the
approach
of
sir
kenneth
and
his
entourage
relaxed
again
but
her
eyes
remained
on
malone
you
may
approach
my
lords
said
the
queen
sir
kenneth
led
the
procession
with
sir
thomas
and
sir
andrew
close
behind
him
and
gamble
came
next
and
bringing
up
the
rear
were
the
four
psychiatrists
they
strode
slowly
along
the
red
carpet
that
stretched
from
the
door
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
they
came
to
a
halt
a
few
feet
from
the
steps
leading
up
to
the
throne
and
bowed
in
unison
you
may
explain
sir
kenneth
her
majesty
said
your
majesty
understands
the
conditions
malone
asked
perfectly
said
the
queen
proceed
now
the
expression
on
barbara
face
changed
to
wonder
and
a
kind
of
fright
malone
did
look
at
her
instead
he
turned
to
what
are
your
plans
for
the
telepaths
who
have
been
brought
here
he
shot
the
question
out
quickly
and
was
caught
well
ah
we
would
like
their
cooperation
in
further
research
which
we
ah
plan
to
do
into
the
actual
mechanisms
of
telepathy
provided
of
course
he
coughed
gently
provided
that
they
become
ah
accessible
miss
i
mean
of
course
her
majesty
has
already
been
a
great
deal
of
help
he
gave
malone
an
odd
look
it
seemed
to
say
coming
next
malone
simply
gave
him
a
nod
and
a
thank
you
doctor
and
turned
to
burris
he
could
feel
barbara
eyes
on
him
but
he
went
on
with
his
prepared
questions
chief
he
said
what
about
you
after
we
nail
our
spy
what
happens
to
her
majesty
i
mean
you
do
intend
to
stop
giving
her
the
homage
due
her
do
you
burris
stared
openmouthed
after
a
second
he
managed
to
say
why
no
of
course
not
sir
kenneth
that
is
and
he
glanced
over
at
the
psychiatrists
if
the
doctors
think
there
was
another
hurried
consultation
the
four
psychiatrists
came
out
of
it
with
a
somewhat
shaky
statement
to
the
effect
that
treatments
which
had
been
proven
to
have
some
therapeutic
value
ought
not
to
be
discontinued
although
of
course
there
was
always
the
chance
that
thank
you
gentlemen
malone
said
smoothly
he
could
see
that
they
were
nervous
and
no
wonder
he
could
imagine
how
difficult
it
was
for
a
psychiatrist
to
talk
about
a
patient
in
her
presence
but
already
realized
that
it
did
make
any
difference
their
thoughts
were
an
open
book
anyway
lady
barbara
said
sir
i
mean
ken
are
you
going
to
what
this
all
about
burris
snapped
just
a
minute
sir
andrew
malone
said
i
like
to
ask
one
of
the
doctors
here
or
all
of
them
for
that
matter
one
more
question
he
whirled
and
faced
them
i
assuming
that
not
one
of
these
persons
is
legally
responsible
for
his
or
her
actions
is
that
correct
another
hurried
huddle
the
psych
boys
were
beginning
to
remind
malone
of
a
football
team
in
rather
unusual
uniforms
finally
one
of
them
said
you
are
correct
according
to
the
latest
statutes
all
of
these
persons
are
legally
insane
including
her
majesty
he
paused
and
gulped
i
except
the
fbi
of
course
and
ourselves
another
pause
and
and
dr
gamble
and
said
lady
barbara
me
she
smiled
sweetly
at
them
all
ah
the
psychiatrist
said
certainly
of
course
he
retired
into
his
group
with
some
confusion
malone
was
looking
straight
at
the
throne
her
majesty
countenance
was
serene
and
unruffled
barbara
said
suddenly
you
do
mean
but
she
and
closed
her
mouth
malone
shot
her
one
quick
look
and
then
turned
to
the
queen
well
your
majesty
he
said
you
have
seen
the
thoughts
of
every
man
here
how
do
they
appear
to
you
her
voice
contained
both
tension
and
relief
they
are
all
good
men
basically
and
kind
men
she
said
and
they
believe
us
that
the
important
thing
you
know
their
belief
in
us
just
as
you
said
that
first
day
we
met
we
needed
belief
for
so
long
for
so
long
her
voice
trailed
off
it
seemed
to
become
lost
in
a
constellation
of
thoughts
barbara
had
turned
to
look
up
at
her
majesty
malone
took
a
step
forward
but
burris
interrupted
him
how
about
the
spy
he
said
then
his
eyes
widened
boyd
standing
next
to
him
leaned
suddenly
forward
that
why
you
mentioned
all
that
about
legal
immunity
because
of
insanity
he
whispered
because
no
barbara
said
no
she
could
she
not
they
were
all
looking
at
her
majesty
now
she
returned
them
stare
for
stare
her
back
stiff
and
straight
and
her
white
hair
enhaloed
in
the
room
light
sir
kenneth
she
said
and
her
voice
was
only
the
least
bit
unsteady
they
all
think
the
spy
barbara
stood
up
listen
she
said
i
did
like
her
majesty
at
first
well
she
was
a
patient
and
that
was
all
and
when
she
started
putting
on
airs
but
since
i
gotten
to
know
her
i
do
like
her
i
like
her
because
she
good
and
kind
herself
and
because
because
she
would
be
a
spy
she
could
be
no
matter
what
any
of
you
think
even
you
sir
kenneth
there
was
a
second
of
silence
of
course
she
not
malone
said
quietly
she
no
spy
would
i
spy
on
my
own
subjects
she
said
use
your
reason
you
mean
burris
began
and
boyd
finished
for
him
she
is
no
malone
snapped
she
is
remember
you
said
it
would
take
a
telepath
to
catch
a
telepath
well
burris
began
well
her
majesty
remembered
it
malone
said
and
acted
on
it
barbara
remained
standing
she
went
to
the
queen
and
put
an
arm
around
the
little
old
lady
shoulder
her
majesty
did
not
object
i
knew
she
said
you
could
have
been
a
spy
listen
dear
the
queen
said
your
kenneth
has
seen
the
truth
of
the
matter
listen
to
him
her
majesty
not
only
caught
the
spy
malone
said
but
she
turned
the
spy
right
over
to
us
he
turned
at
once
and
went
back
down
the
long
red
carpet
to
the
door
really
ought
to
get
a
he
thought
and
did
see
her
majesty
smile
he
opened
the
door
with
a
great
flourish
and
said
quietly
bring
him
in
boys
the
fbi
men
from
las
vegas
marched
in
between
them
was
their
prisoner
a
boy
with
a
vacuous
face
clad
in
a
straitjacket
that
seemed
to
make
no
difference
at
all
to
him
his
mind
was
somewhere
else
but
his
body
was
trapped
between
the
fbi
agents
the
body
of
william
logan
impossible
one
of
the
psychiatrists
said
malone
spun
on
his
heel
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
throne
logan
and
his
guards
followed
closely
your
majesty
malone
said
may
i
present
the
prisoner
perfectly
correct
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
poor
willie
is
your
spy
you
wo
be
too
hard
on
him
will
you
i
do
think
so
your
majesty
malone
said
after
all
now
wait
a
minute
burris
exploded
how
the
hell
did
know
any
of
this
malone
bowed
to
her
majesty
and
winked
at
barbara
he
turned
to
burris
well
he
said
i
had
one
piece
of
information
none
of
the
rest
of
you
had
when
we
were
in
the
desert
edge
sanatorium
dowson
called
you
on
the
phone
remember
sure
i
remember
burris
said
so
well
malone
said
her
majesty
said
she
knew
just
where
the
spy
was
i
asked
her
where
why
did
you
tell
me
burris
screamed
you
knew
all
this
time
and
you
did
tell
me
hold
on
malone
said
i
asked
her
where
and
she
said
right
there
and
she
was
pointing
right
at
your
image
on
the
screen
burris
opened
his
mouth
nothing
came
out
he
closed
it
and
tried
again
at
last
he
managed
one
word
me
he
said
you
malone
said
but
that
what
i
realized
later
she
pointing
at
you
she
was
pointing
at
logan
who
was
in
the
next
room
barbara
whispered
is
that
right
your
majesty
certainly
dear
the
queen
said
calmly
would
i
lie
to
sir
kenneth
malone
was
still
talking
the
thing
that
set
me
off
this
noon
was
something
you
said
sir
andrew
he
went
on
you
said
there
any
sane
telepaths
remember
burris
incapable
of
speech
merely
nodded
but
according
to
her
majesty
malone
said
we
had
every
telepath
in
the
united
states
right
here
she
told
me
that
and
i
did
even
see
it
do
blame
yourself
sir
kenneth
the
queen
put
in
i
did
do
my
best
to
mislead
you
you
know
you
sure
did
malone
said
and
later
on
when
we
were
driving
here
she
said
the
spy
was
around
that
right
he
was
in
the
car
behind
us
going
eighty
miles
an
hour
barbara
stared
malone
got
a
lot
of
satisfaction
out
of
that
stare
but
there
was
still
more
ground
to
cover
then
he
said
she
told
us
he
was
here
at
yucca
flats
after
we
brought
him
here
it
had
to
be
one
of
the
other
six
telepaths
the
psychiatrist
who
muttered
impossible
was
still
muttering
it
malone
ignored
him
and
when
i
remembered
her
pointing
at
you
malone
told
burris
and
remembered
that
she
only
said
right
there
i
knew
it
had
to
be
logan
you
were
there
you
were
only
an
image
on
a
tv
screen
logan
was
there
in
the
room
behind
the
phone
burris
had
found
his
tongue
all
right
he
said
okay
but
all
this
about
misleading
us
and
why
did
she
tell
us
right
away
anyhow
malone
turned
to
her
majesty
on
the
throne
i
think
that
the
queen
had
better
explain
that
if
she
will
queen
elizabeth
thompson
nodded
very
slowly
i
i
only
wanted
you
to
respect
me
she
said
to
treat
me
properly
her
voice
sounded
uneven
and
her
eyes
were
glistening
with
unspilled
tears
lady
barbara
tightened
her
arm
about
the
queen
shoulders
once
more
it
all
right
she
said
we
do
respect
you
the
queen
smiled
up
at
her
malone
waited
after
a
second
her
majesty
continued
i
was
afraid
that
as
soon
as
you
found
poor
willie
you
send
me
back
to
the
hospital
she
said
and
willie
could
tell
the
russian
agents
any
more
once
he
been
taken
away
so
i
thought
i
just
just
let
things
stay
the
way
they
were
as
long
as
i
could
that
all
malone
nodded
after
a
second
he
said
you
see
that
we
possibly
send
you
back
now
do
you
you
know
all
the
state
secrets
your
majesty
malone
said
we
would
rather
that
harman
in
san
francisco
did
try
to
talk
you
out
of
them
or
anyone
else
the
queen
smiled
tremulously
i
know
too
much
do
i
she
said
then
her
grin
faded
poor
harman
she
said
poor
dr
harman
you
hear
about
him
in
a
day
or
so
she
said
i
peeked
inside
his
mind
he
very
ill
lady
barbara
asked
oh
yes
the
queen
said
the
trace
of
a
smile
appeared
on
her
face
he
thinks
that
all
the
patients
in
the
hospital
can
see
inside
his
mind
oh
my
lady
barbara
said
and
began
to
laugh
it
was
the
nicest
sound
malone
had
ever
heard
forget
harman
burris
snapped
what
about
this
spy
ring
how
was
logan
getting
his
information
out
i
already
taken
care
of
that
malone
said
i
had
desert
edge
sanatorium
surrounded
as
soon
as
i
knew
what
the
score
was
he
looked
at
one
of
the
agents
holding
logan
they
ought
to
be
in
the
las
vegas
jail
within
half
an
hour
he
said
in
confirmation
dowson
was
in
on
it
was
he
your
majesty
malone
said
certainly
the
queen
said
her
eyes
were
suddenly
very
cold
i
hope
he
tries
to
escape
i
hope
he
tries
it
malone
knew
just
how
she
felt
one
of
the
psychiatrists
spoke
up
suddenly
i
do
understand
it
he
said
logan
is
completely
catatonic
even
if
he
could
read
minds
how
could
he
tell
dowson
what
he
read
it
does
make
sense
in
the
first
place
the
queen
said
patiently
willie
catatonic
he
just
that
all
he
only
a
boy
and
well
he
does
much
like
being
who
he
is
so
he
visits
other
minds
and
that
way
he
becomes
for
a
while
you
see
vaguely
malone
said
but
how
did
dowson
get
his
information
i
had
everything
worked
out
but
that
i
know
you
did
the
queen
said
and
i
proud
of
you
i
intend
to
award
you
with
the
order
of
the
bath
for
this
day
work
unaccountably
malone
chest
swelled
with
pride
as
for
dowson
the
queen
said
that
traitor
willie
if
he
hurt
enough
he
come
back
her
eyes
were
hard
any
more
he
did
want
to
be
a
spy
really
she
said
but
he
just
a
boy
and
it
must
have
sounded
rather
exciting
he
knew
that
if
he
told
dowson
everything
he
found
out
they
let
him
go
go
away
again
there
was
a
long
silence
well
malone
said
that
about
wraps
it
up
any
questions
he
looked
around
at
the
men
but
before
any
of
them
could
speak
up
her
majesty
rose
i
sure
there
are
questions
she
said
but
i
really
very
tired
my
lords
you
are
excused
she
extended
a
hand
come
lady
barbara
she
said
i
think
i
really
may
need
that
nap
now
malone
put
the
cufflinks
in
his
shirt
with
great
care
they
were
great
stones
and
malone
thought
that
they
gave
his
costume
that
necessary
elizabethan
flair
not
that
he
was
wearing
the
costumes
of
the
queen
court
now
instead
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
dark
blue
a
shirt
and
no
tie
he
selected
one
of
a
gorgeous
peacock
pattern
from
his
closet
rack
boyd
yawned
at
him
from
the
bed
in
the
room
they
were
sharing
stepping
out
he
said
i
am
malone
said
with
restraint
he
whipped
the
tie
round
his
neck
and
drew
it
under
the
collar
anybody
i
know
i
am
meeting
lady
barbara
if
you
wish
to
know
malone
said
my
god
boyd
said
come
down
relax
anyhow
i
got
a
question
for
you
there
was
one
little
thing
her
everlovin
majesty
explain
yes
said
malone
well
about
those
hoods
who
tried
to
gun
us
down
boyd
said
who
hired
and
why
dowson
malone
said
he
wanted
to
kill
us
off
and
then
kidnap
logan
from
the
hotel
room
but
we
foiled
his
plan
by
killing
his
hoods
by
the
time
he
could
work
up
something
else
we
were
on
our
way
to
yucca
flats
great
boyd
said
and
how
did
you
find
out
this
startling
piece
of
information
there
have
been
any
reports
in
from
las
vegas
have
there
no
malone
said
okay
boyd
said
i
give
up
mastermind
malone
wished
boyd
would
stop
using
that
nickname
the
fact
was
as
he
and
apparently
nobody
else
was
willing
to
recognize
that
he
was
anything
like
a
really
terrific
fbi
agent
even
barbara
thought
he
was
something
special
he
was
he
knew
he
was
just
lucky
her
majesty
informed
me
malone
said
her
boyd
stood
with
his
mouth
dropped
open
like
a
fish
waiting
for
some
bait
you
mean
she
knew
well
malone
said
she
did
know
the
guys
in
the
