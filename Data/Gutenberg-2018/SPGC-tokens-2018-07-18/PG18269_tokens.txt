in

introduction
it
might
seem
that
about
blaise
pascal
and
about
the
two
works
on
which
his
fame
is
founded
everything
that
there
is
to
say
had
been
said
the
details
of
his
life
are
as
fully
known
as
we
can
expect
to
know
them
his
mathematical
and
physical
discoveries
have
been
treated
many
times
his
religious
sentiment
and
his
theological
views
have
been
discussed
again
and
again
and
his
prose
style
has
been
analysed
by
french
critics
down
to
the
finest
particular
but
pascal
is
one
of
those
writers
who
will
be
and
who
must
be
studied
afresh
by
men
in
every
generation
it
is
not
he
who
changes
but
we
who
change
it
is
not
our
knowledge
of
him
that
increases
but
our
world
that
alters
and
our
attitudes
towards
it
the
history
of
human
opinions
of
pascal
and
of
men
of
his
stature
is
a
part
of
the
history
of
humanity
that
indicates
his
permanent
importance
the
facts
of
pascal
life
so
far
as
they
are
necessary
for
this
brief
introduction
to
the
are
as
follows
he
was
born
at
clermont
in
auvergne
in
his
family
were
people
of
substance
of
the
upper
middle
class
his
father
was
a
government
official
who
was
able
to
leave
when
he
died
a
sufficient
patrimony
to
his
one
son
and
his
two
daughters
in
the
father
moved
to
paris
and
a
few
years
later
took
up
another
government
post
at
rouen
wherever
he
lived
the
elder
pascal
seems
to
have
mingled
with
some
of
the
best
society
and
with
men
of
eminence
in
science
and
the
arts
blaise
was
educated
entirely
by
his
father
at
home
he
was
exceedingly
precocious
indeed
excessively
precocious
for
his
application
to
studies
in
childhood
and
adolescence
impaired
his
health
and
is
held
responsible
for
his
death
at
prodigious
though
not
incredible
stories
are
preserved
especially
of
his
precocity
in
mathematics
his
mind
was
active
rather
than
accumulative
he
showed
from
his
earliest
years
that
disposition
to
find
things
out
for
himself
which
has
characterised
the
infancy
of
and
other
scientists
of
his
later
discoveries
in
physics
there
is
no
need
for
mention
here
it
must
only
be
remembered
that
he
counts
as
one
of
the
greatest
physicists
and
mathematicians
of
all
time
and
that
his
discoveries
were
made
during
the
years
when
most
scientists
are
still
apprentices
the
elder
pascal
étienne
was
a
sincere
christian
about
he
fell
in
with
some
representatives
of
the
religious
revival
within
the
church
which
has
become
known
as
jansenism
after
jansenius
bishop
of
ypres
whose
theological
work
is
taken
as
the
origin
of
the
movement
this
period
is
usually
spoken
of
as
the
moment
of
pascal
first
conversion
the
word
conversion
however
is
too
forcible
to
be
applied
at
this
point
to
blaise
pascal
himself
the
family
had
always
been
devout
and
the
younger
pascal
though
absorbed
in
his
scientific
work
never
seems
to
have
been
afflicted
with
infidelity
his
attention
was
then
directed
certainly
to
religious
and
theological
matters
but
the
term
conversion
can
only
be
applied
to
his
sisters
the
elder
already
madame
périer
and
particularly
the
younger
jacqueline
who
at
that
time
conceived
a
vocation
for
the
religious
life
pascal
himself
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
renounce
the
world
after
the
death
of
the
father
in
jacqueline
a
young
woman
of
remarkable
strength
and
beauty
of
character
wished
to
take
her
vows
as
a
sister
of
and
for
some
time
her
wish
remained
unfulfilled
owing
to
the
opposition
of
her
brother
his
objection
was
on
the
purely
worldly
ground
that
she
wished
to
make
over
her
patrimony
to
the
order
whereas
while
she
lived
with
him
their
combined
resources
made
it
possible
for
him
to
live
more
nearly
on
a
scale
of
expense
congenial
to
his
tastes
he
liked
in
fact
not
only
to
mix
with
the
best
society
but
to
keep
a
coach
and
horses
six
horses
is
the
number
at
one
time
attributed
to
his
carriage
though
he
had
no
legal
power
to
prevent
his
sister
from
disposing
of
her
property
as
she
elected
the
amiable
jacqueline
shrank
from
doing
so
without
her
brother
willing
approval
the
mother
superior
mère
angélique
herself
an
eminent
personage
in
the
history
of
this
religious
movement
finally
persuaded
the
young
novice
to
enter
the
order
without
the
satisfaction
of
bringing
her
patrimony
with
her
but
jacqueline
remained
so
distressed
by
this
situation
that
her
brother
finally
relented
so
far
as
is
known
the
worldly
life
enjoyed
by
pascal
during
this
period
can
hardly
be
qualified
as
dissipation
and
certainly
not
as
debauchery
even
gambling
may
have
appealed
to
him
chiefly
as
affording
a
study
of
mathematical
probabilities
he
appears
to
have
led
such
a
life
as
any
cultivated
intellectual
man
of
good
position
and
independent
means
might
lead
and
consider
himself
a
model
of
probity
and
virtue
not
even
a
is
laid
at
his
door
though
he
is
said
to
have
contemplated
marriage
but
jansenism
as
represented
by
the
religious
society
of
was
morally
a
puritan
movement
within
the
church
and
its
standards
of
conduct
were
at
least
as
severe
as
those
of
any
puritanism
in
england
or
america
the
period
of
fashionable
society
in
pascal
life
is
however
of
great
importance
in
his
development
it
enlarged
his
knowledge
of
men
and
refined
his
tastes
he
became
a
man
of
the
world
and
never
lost
what
he
had
learnt
and
when
he
turned
his
thoughts
wholly
towards
religion
his
worldly
knowledge
was
a
part
of
his
composition
which
is
essential
to
the
value
of
his
work
pascal
interest
in
society
did
not
distract
him
from
scientific
research
nor
did
this
period
occupy
much
space
in
what
is
a
very
short
and
crowded
life
partly
his
natural
dissatisfaction
with
such
a
life
once
he
had
learned
all
it
had
to
teach
him
partly
the
influence
of
his
saintly
sister
jacqueline
partly
increasing
suffering
as
his
health
declined
directed
him
more
and
more
out
of
the
world
and
to
thoughts
of
eternity
and
in
occurs
what
is
called
his
second
conversion
but
which
might
be
called
his
conversion
simply
he
made
a
note
of
his
mystical
experience
which
he
kept
always
about
him
and
which
was
found
after
his
death
sewn
into
the
coat
which
he
was
wearing
the
experience
occurred
on
november
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
its
genuineness
unless
we
choose
to
deny
all
mystical
experience
now
pascal
was
not
a
mystic
and
his
works
are
not
to
be
classified
amongst
mystical
writings
but
what
can
only
be
called
mystical
experience
happens
to
many
men
who
do
not
become
mystics
the
work
which
he
undertook
soon
after
the
écrites
à
un
is
a
masterpiece
of
religious
controversy
at
the
opposite
pole
from
mysticism
we
know
quite
well
that
he
was
at
the
time
when
he
received
his
illumination
from
god
in
extremely
poor
health
but
it
is
a
commonplace
that
some
forms
of
illness
are
extremely
favourable
not
only
to
religious
illumination
but
to
artistic
and
literary
composition
a
piece
of
writing
meditated
apparently
without
progress
for
months
or
years
may
suddenly
take
shape
and
word
and
in
this
state
long
passages
may
be
produced
which
require
little
or
no
retouch
i
have
no
good
word
to
say
for
the
cultivation
of
automatic
writing
as
the
model
of
literary
composition
i
doubt
whether
these
moments
be
cultivated
by
the
writer
but
he
to
whom
this
happens
assuredly
has
the
sensation
of
being
a
vehicle
rather
than
a
maker
no
masterpiece
can
be
produced
whole
by
such
means
but
neither
does
even
the
higher
form
of
religious
inspiration
suffice
for
the
religious
life
even
the
most
exalted
mystic
must
return
to
the
world
and
use
his
reason
to
employ
the
results
of
his
experience
in
daily
life
you
may
call
it
communion
with
the
divine
or
you
may
call
it
a
temporary
crystallisation
of
the
mind
until
science
can
teach
us
to
reproduce
such
phenomena
at
will
science
can
not
claim
to
have
explained
them
and
they
can
be
judged
only
by
their
fruits
from
that
time
until
his
death
pascal
was
closely
associated
with
the
society
of
which
his
sister
jacqueline
who
predeceased
him
had
joined
as
a
the
society
was
then
fighting
for
its
life
against
the
jesuits
five
propositions
judged
by
a
committee
of
cardinals
and
theologians
at
rome
to
be
heretical
were
found
to
be
put
forward
in
the
work
of
jansenius
and
the
society
of
the
representative
of
jansenism
among
devotional
communities
suffered
a
blow
from
which
it
never
revived
it
is
not
the
place
here
to
review
the
bitter
controversy
and
conflict
the
best
account
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
critic
of
genius
who
took
no
side
who
was
neither
jansenist
nor
jesuit
christian
nor
infidel
is
that
in
the
great
book
of
and
in
this
book
the
parts
devoted
to
pascal
himself
are
among
the
most
brilliant
pages
of
criticism
that
ever
wrote
it
is
sufficient
to
notice
that
the
next
occupation
of
pascal
after
his
conversion
was
to
write
these
eighteen
letters
which
as
prose
are
of
capital
importance
in
the
foundation
of
french
classical
style
and
which
as
polemic
are
surpassed
by
none
not
by
demosthenes
or
cicero
or
swift
they
have
the
limitation
of
all
polemic
and
forensic
they
persuade
they
seduce
they
are
unfair
but
it
is
also
unfair
to
assert
that
in
these
to
a
pascal
was
attacking
the
society
of
jesus
in
itself
he
was
attacking
rather
a
particular
school
of
casuistry
which
relaxed
the
requirements
of
the
confessional
a
school
which
certainly
flourished
amongst
the
society
of
jesus
at
that
time
and
of
which
the
spaniards
escobar
and
molina
are
the
most
eminent
authorities
he
undoubtedly
abused
the
art
of
quotation
as
a
polemical
writer
can
hardly
help
but
do
but
there
were
abuses
for
him
to
abuse
and
he
did
the
job
thoroughly
his
must
not
be
called
theology
academic
theology
was
not
a
department
in
which
pascal
was
versed
when
necessary
the
fathers
of
came
to
his
aid
the
are
the
work
of
one
of
the
finest
mathematical
minds
of
any
time
and
of
a
man
of
the
world
who
addressed
not
theologians
but
the
world
in
general
all
of
the
cultivated
and
many
of
the
less
cultivated
of
the
french
laity
and
with
this
public
they
made
an
astonishing
success
during
this
time
pascal
never
wholly
abandoned
his
scientific
interests
though
in
his
religious
writings
he
composed
slowly
and
painfully
and
revised
often
in
matters
of
mathematics
his
mind
seemed
to
move
with
consummate
natural
ease
and
grace
discoveries
and
inventions
sprang
from
his
brain
without
effort
among
the
minor
devices
of
this
later
period
the
first
omnibus
service
in
paris
is
said
to
owe
its
origin
to
his
inventiveness
but
rapidly
failing
health
and
absorption
in
the
great
work
he
had
in
mind
left
him
little
time
and
energy
during
the
last
two
years
of
his
life
the
plan
of
what
we
call
the
formed
itself
about
the
completed
book
was
to
have
been
a
carefully
constructed
defence
of
christianity
a
true
apology
and
a
kind
of
grammar
of
assent
setting
forth
the
reasons
which
will
convince
the
intellect
as
i
have
indicated
before
pascal
was
not
a
theologian
and
on
dogmatic
theology
had
recourse
to
his
spiritual
advisers
nor
was
he
indeed
a
systematic
philosopher
he
was
a
man
with
an
immense
genius
for
science
and
at
the
same
time
a
natural
psychologist
and
moralist
as
he
was
a
great
literary
artist
his
book
would
have
been
also
his
own
spiritual
autobiography
his
style
free
from
all
diminishing
idiosyncrasies
was
yet
very
personal
above
all
he
was
a
man
of
strong
passions
and
his
intellectual
passion
for
truth
was
reinforced
by
his
passionate
dissatisfaction
with
human
life
unless
a
spiritual
explanation
could
be
found
we
must
regard
the
as
merely
the
first
notes
for
a
work
which
he
left
far
from
completion
we
have
in
words
a
tower
of
which
the
stones
have
been
laid
on
each
other
but
not
cemented
and
the
structure
unfinished
in
early
years
his
memory
had
been
amazingly
retentive
of
anything
that
he
wished
to
remember
and
had
it
not
been
impaired
by
increasing
illness
and
pain
he
probably
would
not
have
been
obliged
to
set
down
these
notes
at
all
but
taking
the
book
as
it
is
left
to
us
we
still
find
that
it
occupies
a
unique
place
in
the
history
of
french
literature
and
in
the
history
of
religious
meditation
to
understand
the
method
which
pascal
employs
the
reader
must
be
prepared
to
follow
the
process
of
the
mind
of
the
intelligent
believer
the
christian
thinker
and
i
mean
the
man
who
is
trying
consciously
and
conscientiously
to
explain
to
himself
the
sequence
which
culminated
in
faith
rather
than
the
public
apologist
proceeds
by
rejection
and
elimination
he
finds
the
world
to
be
so
and
so
he
finds
its
character
inexplicable
by
any
theory
among
religions
he
finds
christianity
and
catholic
christianity
to
account
most
satisfactorily
for
the
world
and
especially
for
the
moral
world
within
and
thus
by
what
newman
calls
powerful
and
concurrent
reasons
he
finds
himself
inexorably
committed
to
the
dogma
of
the
incarnation
to
the
unbeliever
this
method
seems
disingenuous
and
perverse
for
the
unbeliever
is
as
a
rule
not
so
greatly
troubled
to
explain
the
world
to
himself
nor
so
greatly
distressed
by
its
disorder
nor
is
he
generally
concerned
in
modern
terms
to
preserve
values
he
does
not
consider
that
if
certain
emotional
states
certain
developments
of
character
and
what
in
the
highest
sense
can
be
called
saintliness
are
inherently
and
by
inspection
known
to
be
good
then
the
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
world
must
be
an
explanation
which
will
admit
the
reality
of
these
values
nor
does
he
consider
such
reasoning
admissible
he
would
so
to
speak
trim
his
values
according
to
his
cloth
because
to
him
such
values
are
of
no
great
value
the
unbeliever
starts
from
the
other
end
and
as
likely
as
not
with
the
question
is
a
case
of
human
parthenogenesis
credible
and
this
he
would
call
going
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
now
pascal
method
is
on
the
whole
the
method
natural
and
right
for
the
christian
and
the
opposite
method
is
that
taken
by
voltaire
it
is
worth
while
to
remember
that
voltaire
in
his
attempt
to
refute
pascal
has
given
once
and
for
all
the
type
of
such
refutation
and
that
later
opponents
of
pascal
apology
for
the
christian
faith
have
contributed
little
beyond
psychological
irrelevancies
for
voltaire
has
presented
better
than
any
one
since
what
is
the
unbelieving
point
of
view
and
in
the
end
we
must
all
choose
for
ourselves
between
one
point
of
view
and
another
i
have
said
above
that
pascal
method
is
on
the
whole
that
of
the
typical
christian
apologist
and
this
reservation
was
directed
at
pascal
belief
in
miracles
which
plays
a
larger
part
in
his
construction
than
it
would
in
that
at
least
of
the
modern
liberal
catholic
it
would
seem
fantastic
to
accept
christianity
because
we
first
believe
the
gospel
miracles
to
be
true
and
it
would
seem
impious
to
accept
it
primarily
because
we
believe
more
recent
miracles
to
be
true
we
accept
the
miracles
or
some
miracles
to
be
true
because
we
believe
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
we
found
our
belief
in
the
miracles
on
the
gospel
not
our
belief
in
the
gospel
on
the
miracles
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
pascal
had
been
deeply
impressed
by
a
contemporary
miracle
known
as
the
miracle
of
the
holy
thorn
a
thorn
reputed
to
have
been
preserved
from
the
crown
of
our
lord
was
pressed
upon
an
ulcer
which
quickly
healed
who
as
a
medical
man
felt
himself
on
solid
ground
discusses
fully
the
possible
explanation
of
this
apparent
miracle
it
is
true
that
the
miracle
happened
at
and
that
it
arrived
opportunely
to
revive
the
depressed
spirits
of
the
community
in
its
political
afflictions
and
it
is
likely
that
pascal
was
the
more
inclined
to
believe
a
miracle
which
was
performed
upon
his
beloved
sister
in
any
case
it
probably
led
him
to
assign
a
place
to
miracles
in
his
study
of
faith
which
is
not
quite
that
which
we
should
give
to
them
ourselves
now
the
great
adversary
against
whom
pascal
set
himself
from
the
time
of
his
first
conversations
with
de
saci
at
was
montaigne
one
can
not
destroy
pascal
certainly
but
of
all
authors
montaigne
is
one
of
the
least
destructible
you
could
as
well
dissipate
a
fog
by
flinging
into
it
for
montaigne
is
a
fog
a
gas
a
fluid
insidious
element
he
does
not
reason
he
insinuates
charms
and
influences
or
if
he
reasons
you
must
be
prepared
for
his
having
some
other
design
upon
you
than
to
convince
you
by
his
argument
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
montaigne
is
the
most
essential
author
to
know
if
we
would
understand
the
course
of
french
thought
during
the
last
three
hundred
years
in
every
way
the
influence
of
montaigne
was
repugnant
to
the
men
of
pascal
studied
him
with
the
intention
of
demolishing
him
yet
in
the
at
the
very
end
of
his
life
we
find
passage
after
passage
and
the
slighter
they
are
the
more
significant
almost
lifted
out
of
montaigne
down
to
a
figure
of
speech
or
a
word
the
parallels
a
are
most
often
with
the
long
essay
of
montaigne
called
de
raymond
an
astonishing
piece
of
writing
upon
which
shakespeare
also
probably
drew
in
indeed
by
the
time
a
man
knew
montaigne
well
enough
to
attack
him
he
would
already
be
thoroughly
infected
by
him
a
cf
the
use
of
the
simile
of
the
for
comparing
parallel
passages
the
edition
of
the
by
henri
massis
la
cité
des
is
better
than
the
edition
of
jacques
chevalier
gabalda
it
seems
just
possible
that
in
the
latter
edition
and
also
in
his
biographical
study
by
jacques
chevalier
english
translation
published
by
sheed
ward
chevalier
is
a
little
to
demonstrate
the
perfect
orthodoxy
of
pascal
it
would
however
be
grossly
unfair
to
pascal
to
montaigne
and
indeed
to
french
literature
to
leave
the
matter
at
that
it
is
no
diminution
of
pascal
but
only
an
aggrandisement
of
montaigne
had
montaigne
been
an
ordinary
sceptic
a
small
man
like
anatole
france
or
even
a
greater
man
like
renan
or
even
like
the
greatest
sceptic
of
all
voltaire
this
influence
would
be
to
the
discredit
of
pascal
but
if
montaigne
had
been
no
more
than
voltaire
he
could
not
have
affected
pascal
at
all
the
picture
of
montaigne
which
offers
itself
first
to
our
eyes
that
of
the
original
and
independent
solitary
personality
absorbed
in
amused
analysis
of
himself
is
deceptive
montaigne
is
no
pyrrhonism
like
that
of
voltaire
renan
or
france
he
exists
so
to
speak
on
a
plan
of
numerous
concentric
circles
the
most
apparent
of
which
is
the
small
inmost
circle
a
personal
puckish
scepticism
which
can
be
easily
aped
if
not
imitated
but
what
makes
montaigne
a
very
great
figure
is
that
he
succeeded
god
knows
how
for
montaigne
very
likely
did
not
know
that
he
had
done
it
it
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
men
observe
about
themselves
for
it
is
essentially
bigger
than
the
individual
consciousness
he
succeeded
in
giving
expression
to
the
scepticism
of
human
being
for
every
man
who
thinks
and
lives
by
thought
must
have
his
own
scepticism
that
which
stops
at
the
question
that
which
ends
in
denial
or
that
which
leads
to
faith
and
which
is
somehow
integrated
into
the
faith
which
transcends
it
and
pascal
as
the
type
of
one
kind
of
religious
believer
which
is
highly
passionate
and
ardent
but
passionate
only
through
a
powerful
and
regulated
intellect
is
in
the
first
sections
of
his
unfinished
apology
for
christianity
facing
unflinchingly
the
demon
of
doubt
which
is
inseparable
from
the
spirit
of
belief
there
is
accordingly
something
quite
different
from
an
influence
which
would
prove
pascal
weakness
there
is
a
real
affinity
between
his
doubt
and
that
of
montaigne
and
through
the
common
kinship
with
montaigne
pascal
is
related
to
the
noble
and
distinguished
line
of
french
moralists
from
la
rochefoucauld
down
in
the
honesty
with
which
they
face
the
of
the
actual
world
this
french
tradition
has
a
unique
quality
in
european
literature
and
in
the
seventeenth
century
hobbes
is
crude
and
uncivilised
in
comparison
pascal
is
a
man
of
the
world
among
ascetics
and
an
ascetic
among
men
of
the
world
he
had
the
knowledge
of
worldliness
and
the
passion
of
asceticism
and
in
him
the
two
are
fused
into
an
individual
whole
the
majority
of
mankind
is
incurious
absorbed
in
vanities
and
tepid
in
emotion
and
is
therefore
incapable
of
either
much
doubt
or
much
faith
and
when
the
ordinary
man
calls
himself
a
sceptic
or
an
unbeliever
that
is
ordinarily
a
simple
pose
cloaking
a
disinclination
to
think
anything
out
to
a
conclusion
pascal
disillusioned
analysis
of
human
bondage
is
sometimes
interpreted
to
mean
that
pascal
was
really
and
finally
an
unbeliever
who
in
his
despair
was
incapable
of
enduring
reality
and
enjoying
the
heroic
satisfaction
of
the
free
worship
of
nothing
his
despair
his
disillusion
are
however
no
illustration
of
personal
weakness
they
are
perfectly
objective
because
they
are
essential
moments
in
the
progress
of
the
intellectual
soul
and
for
the
type
of
pascal
they
are
the
analogue
of
the
drought
the
dark
night
which
is
an
essential
stage
in
the
progress
of
the
christian
mystic
a
similar
despair
when
it
is
arrived
at
by
a
diseased
character
or
an
impure
soul
may
issue
in
the
most
disastrous
consequences
though
with
the
most
superb
manifestations
and
thus
we
get
but
in
pascal
we
find
no
such
distortion
his
despair
is
in
itself
more
terrible
than
swift
because
our
heart
tells
us
that
it
corresponds
exactly
to
the
facts
and
can
not
be
dismissed
as
mental
disease
but
it
was
also
a
despair
which
was
a
necessary
prelude
to
and
element
in
the
joy
of
faith
i
do
not
wish
to
enter
any
further
than
necessary
upon
the
question
of
the
heterodoxy
of
jansenism
and
it
is
no
concern
of
this
essay
whether
the
five
propositions
condemned
at
rome
were
really
maintained
by
jansenius
in
his
book
or
whether
we
should
deplore
or
approve
the
consequent
decay
indeed
with
some
persecution
of
it
is
impossible
to
discuss
the
matter
without
becoming
involved
as
a
controversialist
either
for
or
against
rome
but
in
a
man
of
the
type
of
pascal
and
the
type
always
exists
there
is
i
think
an
ingredient
of
what
may
be
called
jansenism
of
temperament
without
identifying
it
with
the
jansenism
of
jansenius
and
of
other
devout
and
sincere
but
not
immensely
gifted
doctors
b
it
is
accordingly
needful
to
state
in
brief
what
the
dangerous
doctrine
of
jansenius
was
without
advancing
too
far
into
theological
refinements
it
is
recognised
in
christian
theology
and
indeed
on
a
lower
plane
it
is
recognised
by
all
men
in
affairs
of
daily
life
that
freewill
or
the
natural
effort
and
ability
of
the
individual
man
and
also
supernatural
a
gift
accorded
we
know
not
quite
how
are
both
required
in
for
salvation
though
numerous
theologians
have
set
their
wits
at
the
problem
it
ends
in
a
mystery
which
we
can
perceive
but
not
finally
decipher
at
least
it
is
obvious
that
like
any
doctrine
a
slight
excess
or
deviation
to
one
side
or
the
other
will
precipitate
a
heresy
the
pelagians
who
were
refuted
by
augustine
emphasised
the
efficacy
of
human
effort
and
belittled
the
importance
of
supernatural
grace
the
calvinists
emphasised
the
degradation
of
man
through
original
sin
and
considered
mankind
so
corrupt
that
the
will
was
of
no
avail
and
thus
fell
into
the
doctrine
of
predestination
it
was
upon
the
doctrine
of
grace
according
to
augustine
that
the
jansenists
relied
and
the
of
jansenius
was
presented
as
a
sound
exposition
of
the
augustinian
views
b
the
great
man
of
was
of
course
but
any
one
who
is
interested
will
certainly
consult
first
of
all
the
book
of
mentioned
such
heresies
are
never
antiquated
because
they
forever
assume
new
forms
for
instance
the
insistence
upon
good
works
and
service
which
is
preached
from
many
quarters
or
the
simple
faith
that
any
one
who
lives
a
good
and
useful
life
need
have
no
morbid
anxieties
about
salvation
is
a
form
of
pelagianism
on
the
other
hand
one
sometimes
hears
enounced
the
view
that
it
will
make
no
real
difference
if
all
the
traditional
religious
sanctions
for
moral
behaviour
break
down
because
those
who
are
born
and
bred
to
be
nice
people
will
always
prefer
to
behave
nicely
and
those
who
are
not
will
behave
otherwise
in
any
case
and
this
is
surely
a
form
of
predestination
for
the
hazard
of
being
born
a
nice
person
or
not
is
as
uncertain
as
the
gift
of
grace
it
is
likely
that
pascal
was
attracted
as
much
by
the
fruits
of
jansenism
in
the
life
of
as
by
the
doctrine
itself
this
devout
ascetic
thoroughgoing
society
striving
heroically
in
the
midst
of
a
relaxed
and
christianity
was
formed
to
attract
a
nature
so
concentrated
so
passionate
and
so
thoroughgoing
as
pascal
but
the
insistence
upon
the
degraded
and
helpless
state
of
man
in
jansenism
is
something
also
to
which
we
must
be
grateful
for
to
it
we
owe
the
magnificent
analysis
of
human
motives
and
occupations
which
was
to
have
constituted
the
early
part
of
his
book
and
apart
from
the
jansenism
which
is
the
work
of
a
not
very
eminent
bishop
who
wrote
a
latin
treatise
which
is
now
unread
there
is
also
so
to
speak
a
jansenism
of
the
individual
biography
a
moment
of
jansenism
may
naturally
take
place
and
take
place
rightly
in
the
individual
particularly
in
the
life
of
a
man
of
great
and
intense
intellectual
powers
who
can
not
avoid
seeing
through
human
beings
and
observing
the
vanity
of
their
thoughts
and
of
their
avocations
their
dishonesty
and
the
insincerity
of
their
emotions
their
cowardice
the
pettiness
of
their
real
ambitions
actually
considering
that
pascal
died
at
the
age
of
one
must
be
amazed
at
the
balance
and
justice
of
his
observations
much
greater
maturity
is
required
for
these
qualities
than
for
any
mathematical
or
scientific
greatness
how
easily
his
brooding
on
misery
of
man
without
might
have
encouraged
in
him
the
sin
of
spiritual
pride
the
de
and
how
fast
a
hold
he
has
of
humility
and
although
pascal
brings
to
his
work
the
same
powers
which
he
exerted
in
science
it
is
not
as
a
scientist
that
he
presents
himself
he
does
not
seem
to
say
to
the
reader
i
am
one
of
the
most
distinguished
scientists
of
the
day
i
understand
many
matters
which
will
always
be
mysteries
to
you
and
through
science
i
have
come
to
the
faith
you
therefore
who
are
not
initiated
into
science
ought
to
have
faith
if
i
have
it
he
is
fully
aware
of
the
difference
of
and
his
famous
distinction
between
the
de
and
the
de
is
one
to
ponder
over
it
is
the
just
combination
of
the
scientist
the
and
the
religious
nature
with
a
passionate
craving
for
god
that
makes
pascal
unique
he
succeeds
where
descartes
fails
for
in
descartes
the
element
of
de
is
excessive
c
and
in
a
few
phrases
about
descartes
in
the
present
book
pascal
laid
his
finger
on
the
place
of
weakness
c
for
a
brilliant
criticism
of
the
errors
of
descartes
from
a
theological
point
of
view
the
reader
is
referred
to
by
jacques
maritain
translation
published
by
sheed
ward
he
who
reads
this
book
will
observe
at
once
its
fragmentary
nature
but
only
after
some
study
will
perceive
that
the
fragmentariness
lies
in
the
expression
more
than
in
the
thought
the
thoughts
can
not
be
detached
from
each
other
and
quoted
as
if
each
were
complete
in
itself
cœur

la

connaît
how
often
one
has
heard
that
quoted
and
quoted
often
to
the
wrong
purpose
for
this
is
by
no
means
an
exaltation
of
the
heart
over
the
head
a
defence
of
unreason
the
heart
in
pascal
terminology
is
itself
truly
rational
if
it
is
truly
the
heart
for
him
in
theological
matters
which
seemed
to
him
much
larger
more
difficult
and
more
important
than
scientific
matters
the
whole
personality
is
involved
we
can
not
quite
understand
any
of
the
parts
fragmentary
as
they
are
without
some
understanding
of
the
whole
capital
for
instance
is
his
analysis
of
the
the
order
of
nature
the
order
of
mind
and
the
order
of
charity
these
three
are
the
higher
is
not
implicit
in
the
lower
as
in
an
evolutionary
doctrine
it
would
be
d
in
this
distinction
pascal
offers
much
about
which
the
modern
world
would
do
well
to
think
and
indeed
because
of
his
unique
combination
and
balance
of
qualities
i
know
of
no
religious
writer
more
pertinent
to
our
time
the
great
mystics
like
john
of
the
cross
are
primarily
for
readers
with
a
special
determination
of
purpose
the
devotional
writers
such
as
françois
de
sales
are
primarily
for
those
who
already
feel
consciously
desirous
of
the
love
of
god
the
great
theologians
are
for
those
interested
in
theology
but
i
can
think
of
no
christian
writer
not
newman
even
more
to
be
commended
than
pascal
to
those
who
doubt
but
who
have
the
mind
to
conceive
and
the
sensibility
to
feel
the
disorder
the
futility
the
meaninglessness
the
mystery
of
life
and
suffering
and
who
can
only
find
peace
through
a
satisfaction

thoughts
on
mind
and
on
style
difference
between
the
mathematical
and
the
intuitive
in
the
one
the
principles
are
palpable
but
removed
from
ordinary
use
so
that
for
want
of
habit
it
is
difficult
to
turn
one
mind
in
that
direction
but
if
one
turns
it
thither
ever
so
little
one
sees
the
principles
fully
and
one
must
have
a
quite
inaccurate
mind
who
reasons
wrongly
from
principles
so
plain
that
it
is
almost
impossible
they
should
escape
notice
but
in
the
intuitive
mind
the
principles
are
found
in
common
use
and
are
before
the
eyes
of
everybody
one
has
only
to
look
and
no
effort
is
necessary
it
is
only
a
question
of
good
eyesight
but
it
must
be
good
for
the
principles
are
so
subtle
and
so
numerous
that
it
is
almost
impossible
but
that
some
escape
notice
now
the
omission
of
one
principle
leads
to
error
thus
one
must
have
very
clear
sight
to
see
all
the
principles
and
in
the
next
place
an
accurate
mind
not
to
draw
false
deductions
from
known
principles
all
mathematicians
would
then
be
intuitive
if
they
had
clear
sight
for
they
do
not
reason
incorrectly
from
principles
known
to
them
and
intuitive
minds
would
be
mathematical
if
they
could
turn
their
eyes
to
the
principles
of
mathematics
to
which
they
are
unused
the
reason
therefore
that
some
intuitive
minds
are
not
mathematical
is
that
they
can
not
at
all
turn
their
attention
to
the
principles
of
mathematics
but
the
reason
that
mathematicians
are
not
intuitive
is
that
they
do
not
see
what
is
before
them
and
that
accustomed
to
the
exact
and
plain
principles
of
mathematics
and
not
reasoning
till
they
have
well
inspected
and
arranged
their
principles
they
are
lost
in
matters
of
intuition
where
the
principles
do
not
allow
of
such
arrangement
they
are
scarcely
seen
they
are
felt
rather
than
seen
there
is
the
greatest
difficulty
in
making
them
felt
by
those
who
do
not
of
themselves
perceive
them
these
principles
are
so
fine
and
so
numerous
that
a
very
delicate
and
very
clear
sense
is
needed
to
perceive
them
and
to
judge
rightly
and
justly
when
they
are
perceived
without
for
the
most
part
being
able
to
demonstrate
them
in
order
as
in
mathematics
because
the
principles
are
not
known
to
us
in
the
same
way
and
because
it
would
be
an
endless
matter
to
undertake
it
we
must
see
the
matter
at
once
at
one
glance
and
not
by
a
process
of
reasoning
at
least
to
a
certain
degree
and
thus
it
is
rare
that
mathematicians
are
intuitive
and
that
men
of
intuition
are
mathematicians
because
mathematicians
wish
to
treat
matters
of
intuition
mathematically
and
make
themselves
ridiculous
wishing
to
begin
with
definitions
and
then
with
axioms
which
is
not
the
way
to
proceed
in
this
kind
of
reasoning
not
that
the
mind
does
not
do
so
but
it
does
it
tacitly
naturally
and
without
technical
rules
for
the
expression
of
it
is
beyond
all
men
and
only
a
few
can
feel
it
intuitive
minds
on
the
contrary
being
thus
accustomed
to
judge
at
a
single
glance
are
so
astonished
when
they
are
presented
with
propositions
of
which
they
understand
nothing
and
the
way
to
which
is
through
definitions
and
axioms
so
sterile
and
which
they
are
not
accustomed
to
see
thus
in
detail
that
they
are
repelled
and
disheartened
but
dull
minds
are
never
either
intuitive
or
mathematical
mathematicians
who
are
only
mathematicians
have
exact
minds
provided
all
things
are
explained
to
them
by
means
of
definitions
and
axioms
otherwise
they
are
inaccurate
and
insufferable
for
they
are
only
right
when
the
principles
are
quite
clear
and
men
of
intuition
who
are
only
intuitive
can
not
have
the
patience
to
reach
to
first
principles
of
things
speculative
and
conceptual
which
they
have
never
seen
in
the
world
and
which
are
altogether
out
of
the
common
there
are
different
kinds
of
right
understanding
some
have
right
understanding
in
a
certain
order
of
things
and
not
in
others
where
they
go
astray
some
draw
conclusions
well
from
a
few
premises
and
this
displays
an
acute
judgment
others
draw
conclusions
well
where
there
are
many
premises
for
example
the
former
easily
learn
hydrostatics
where
the
premises
are
few
but
the
conclusions
are
so
fine
that
only
the
greatest
acuteness
can
reach
them
and
in
spite
of
that
these
persons
would
perhaps
not
be
great
mathematicians
because
mathematics
contain
a
great
number
of
premises
and
there
is
perhaps
a
kind
of
intellect
that
can
search
with
ease
a
few
premises
to
the
bottom
and
can
not
in
the
least
penetrate
those
matters
in
which
there
are
many
premises
there
are
then
two
kinds
of
intellect
the
one
able
to
penetrate
acutely
and
deeply
into
the
conclusions
of
given
premises
and
this
is
the
precise
intellect
the
other
able
to
comprehend
a
great
number
of
premises
without
confusing
them
and
this
is
the
mathematical
intellect
the
one
has
force
and
exactness
the
other
comprehension
now
the
one
quality
can
exist
without
the
other
the
intellect
can
be
strong
and
narrow
and
can
also
be
comprehensive
and
weak
those
who
are
accustomed
to
judge
by
feeling
do
not
understand
the
process
of
reasoning
for
they
would
understand
at
first
sight
and
are
not
used
to
seek
for
principles
and
others
on
the
contrary
who
are
accustomed
to
reason
from
principles
do
not
at
all
understand
matters
of
feeling
seeking
principles
and
being
unable
to
see
at
a
glance
true
eloquence
makes
light
of
eloquence
true
morality
makes
light
of
morality
that
is
to
say
the
morality
of
the
judgment
which
has
no
rules
makes
light
of
the
morality
of
the
intellect
for
it
is
to
judgment
that
perception
belongs
as
science
belongs
to
intellect
intuition
is
the
part
of
judgment
mathematics
of
intellect
to
make
light
of
philosophy
is
to
be
a
true
philosopher
those
who
judge
of
a
work
by
rule
are
in
regard
to
others
as
those
who
have
a
watch
are
in
regard
to
others
one
says
it
is
two
hours
ago
the
other
says
it
is
only
of
an
hour
i
look
at
my
watch
and
say
to
the
one
you
are
weary
and
to
the
other
time
gallops
with
you
for
it
is
only
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
and
i
laugh
at
those
who
tell
me
that
time
goes
slowly
with
me
and
that
i
judge
by
imagination
they
do
not
know
that
i
judge
by
my
watch
just
as
we
harm
the
understanding
we
harm
the
feelings
also
the
understanding
and
the
feelings
are
moulded
by
intercourse
the
understanding
and
feelings
are
corrupted
by
intercourse
thus
good
or
bad
society
improves
or
corrupts
them
it
is
then
to
know
how
to
choose
in
order
to
improve
and
not
to
corrupt
them
and
we
can
not
make
this
choice
if
they
be
not
already
improved
and
not
corrupted
thus
a
circle
is
formed
and
those
are
fortunate
who
escape
it
the
greater
intellect
one
has
the
more
originality
one
finds
in
men
ordinary
persons
find
no
difference
between
men
there
are
many
people
who
listen
to
a
sermon
in
the
same
way
as
they
listen
to
vespers
when
we
wish
to
correct
with
advantage
and
to
show
another
that
he
errs
we
must
notice
from
what
side
he
views
the
matter
for
on
that
side
it
is
usually
true
and
admit
that
truth
to
him
but
reveal
to
him
the
side
on
which
it
is
false
he
is
satisfied
with
that
for
he
sees
that
he
was
not
mistaken
and
that
he
only
failed
to
see
all
sides
now
no
one
is
offended
at
not
seeing
everything
but
one
does
not
like
to
be
mistaken
and
that
perhaps
arises
from
the
fact
that
man
naturally
can
not
see
everything
and
that
naturally
he
can
not
err
in
the
side
he
looks
at
since
the
perceptions
of
our
senses
are
always
true
people
are
generally
better
persuaded
by
the
reasons
which
they
have
themselves
discovered
than
by
those
which
have
come
into
the
mind
of
others
all
great
amusements
are
dangerous
to
the
christian
life
but
among
all
those
which
the
world
has
invented
there
is
none
more
to
be
feared
than
the
theatre
it
is
a
representation
of
the
passions
so
natural
and
so
delicate
that
it
excites
them
and
gives
birth
to
them
in
our
hearts
and
above
all
to
that
of
love
principally
when
it
is
represented
as
very
chaste
and
virtuous
for
the
more
innocent
it
appears
to
innocent
souls
the
more
they
are
likely
to
be
touched
by
it
its
violence
pleases
our
which
immediately
forms
a
desire
to
produce
the
same
effects
which
are
seen
so
well
represented
and
at
the
same
time
we
make
ourselves
a
conscience
founded
on
the
propriety
of
the
feelings
which
we
see
there
by
which
the
fear
of
pure
souls
is
removed
since
they
imagine
that
it
can
not
hurt
their
purity
to
love
with
a
love
which
seems
to
them
so
reasonable
so
we
depart
from
the
theatre
with
our
heart
so
filled
with
all
the
beauty
and
tenderness
of
love
the
soul
and
the
mind
so
persuaded
of
its
innocence
that
we
are
quite
ready
to
receive
its
first
impressions
or
rather
to
seek
an
opportunity
of
awakening
them
in
the
heart
of
another
in
order
that
we
may
receive
the
same
pleasures
and
the
same
sacrifices
which
we
have
seen
so
well
represented
in
the
theatre
scaramouch
who
only
thinks
of
one
thing
the
doctor
who
speaks
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
he
has
said
everything
so
full
is
he
of
the
desire
of
talking
one
likes
to
see
the
error
the
passion
of
cleobuline
because
she
is
unconscious
of
it
she
would
be
displeasing
if
she
were
not
deceived
when
a
natural
discourse
paints
a
passion
or
an
effect
one
feels
within
oneself
the
truth
of
what
one
reads
which
was
there
before
although
one
did
not
know
it
hence
one
is
inclined
to
love
him
who
makes
us
feel
it
for
he
has
not
shown
us
his
own
riches
but
ours
and
thus
this
benefit
renders
him
pleasing
to
us
besides
that
such
community
of
intellect
as
we
have
with
him
necessarily
inclines
the
heart
to
love
eloquence
which
persuades
by
sweetness
not
by
authority
as
a
tyrant
not
as
a
king
eloquence
is
an
art
of
saying
things
in
such
a
way
that
those
to
whom
we
speak
may
listen
to
them
without
pain
and
with
pleasure
that
they
feel
themselves
interested
so
that
leads
them
more
willingly
to
reflection
upon
it
it
consists
then
in
a
correspondence
which
we
seek
to
establish
between
the
head
and
the
heart
of
those
to
whom
we
speak
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
between
the
thoughts
and
the
expressions
which
we
employ
this
assumes
that
we
have
studied
well
the
heart
of
man
so
as
to
know
all
its
powers
and
then
to
find
the
just
proportions
of
the
discourse
which
we
wish
to
adapt
to
them
we
must
put
ourselves
in
the
place
of
those
who
are
to
hear
us
and
make
trial
on
our
own
heart
of
the
turn
which
we
give
to
our
discourse
in
order
to
see
whether
one
is
made
for
the
other
and
whether
we
can
assure
ourselves
that
the
hearer
will
be
as
it
were
forced
to
surrender
we
ought
to
restrict
ourselves
so
far
as
possible
to
the
simple
and
natural
and
not
to
magnify
that
which
is
little
or
belittle
that
which
is
great
it
is
not
enough
that
a
thing
be
beautiful
it
must
be
suitable
to
the
subject
and
there
must
be
in
it
nothing
of
excess
or
defect
rivers
are
roads
which
move
and
which
carry
us
whither
we
desire
to
go
when
we
do
not
know
the
truth
of
a
thing
it
is
of
advantage
that
there
should
exist
a
common
error
which
determines
the
mind
of
man
as
for
example
the
moon
to
which
is
attributed
the
change
of
seasons
the
progress
of
diseases
etc
for
the
chief
malady
of
man
is
restless
curiosity
about
things
which
he
can
not
understand
and
it
is
not
so
bad
for
him
to
be
in
error
as
to
be
curious
to
no
purpose
the
manner
in
which
epictetus
montaigne
and
salomon
de
tultie
wrote
is
the
most
usual
the
most
suggestive
the
most
remembered
and
the
oftenest
quoted
because
it
is
entirely
composed
of
thoughts
born
from
the
common
talk
of
life
as
when
we
speak
of
the
common
error
which
exists
among
men
that
the
moon
is
the
cause
of
everything
we
never
fail
to
say
that
salomon
de
tultie
says
that
when
we
do
not
know
the
truth
of
a
thing
it
is
of
advantage
that
there
should
exist
a
common
error
etc
which
is
the
thought
above
the
last
thing
one
settles
in
writing
a
book
is
what
one
should
put
in
first
why
should
i
undertake
to
divide
my
virtues
into
four
rather
than
into
six
why
should
i
rather
establish
virtue
in
four
in
two
in
one
why
into
et
rather
than
into
follow
nature
or
conduct
your
private
affairs
without
injustice
as
plato
or
anything
else
but
there
you
will
say
everything
is
contained
in
one
word
yes
but
it
is
useless
without
explanation
and
when
we
come
to
explain
it
as
soon
as
we
unfold
this
maxim
which
contains
all
the
rest
they
emerge
in
that
first
confusion
which
you
desired
to
avoid
so
when
they
are
all
included
in
one
they
are
hidden
and
useless
as
in
a
chest
and
never
appear
save
in
their
natural
confusion
nature
has
established
them
all
without
including
one
in
the
other
nature
has
made
all
her
truths
independent
of
one
another
our
art
makes
one
dependent
on
the
other
but
this
is
not
natural
each
keeps
its
own
place
let
no
one
say
that
i
have
said
nothing
new
the
arrangement
of
the
subject
is
new
when
we
play
tennis
we
both
play
with
the
same
ball
but
one
of
us
places
it
better
i
had
as
soon
it
said
that
i
used
words
employed
before
and
in
the
same
way
if
the
same
thoughts
in
a
different
arrangement
do
not
form
a
different
discourse
no
more
do
the
same
words
in
their
different
arrangement
form
different
thoughts
words
differently
arranged
have
a
different
meaning
and
meanings
differently
arranged
have
different
effects
we
should
not
turn
the
mind
from
one
thing
to
another
except
for
relaxation
and
that
when
it
is
necessary
and
the
time
suitable
and
not
otherwise
for
he
that
relaxes
out
of
season
wearies
and
he
who
wearies
us
out
of
season
makes
us
languid
since
we
turn
quite
away
so
much
does
our
perverse
lust
like
to
do
the
contrary
of
what
those
wish
to
obtain
from
us
without
giving
us
pleasure
the
coin
for
which
we
will
do
whatever
is
wanted
it
requires
the
pleasant
and
the
real
but
the
pleasant
must
itself
be
drawn
from
the
true
eloquence
is
a
painting
of
thought
and
thus
those
who
after
having
painted
it
add
something
more
make
a
picture
instead
of
a
portrait
those
who
make
antitheses
by
forcing
words
are
like
those
who
make
false
windows
for
symmetry
their
rule
is
not
to
speak
accurately
but
to
make
apt
figures
of
speech
symmetry
is
what
we
see
at
a
glance
based
on
the
fact
that
there
is
no
reason
for
any
difference
and
based
also
on
the
face
of
man
whence
it
happens
that
symmetry
is
only
wanted
in
breadth
not
in
height
or
depth
when
we
see
a
natural
style
we
are
astonished
and
delighted
for
we
expected
to
see
an
author
and
we
find
a
man
whereas
those
who
have
good
taste
and
who
seeing
a
book
expect
to
find
a
man
are
quite
surprised
to
find
an
author
poetice
quam
humane
locutus
those
honour
nature
well
who
teach
that
she
can
speak
on
everything
even
on
theology
we
only
consult
the
ear
because
the
heart
is
wanting
the
rule
is
uprightness
beauty
of
omission
of
judgment
all
the
false
beauties
which
we
blame
in
cicero
have
their
admirers
and
in
great
number
there
is
a
certain
standard
of
grace
and
beauty
which
consists
in
a
certain
relation
between
our
nature
such
as
it
is
weak
or
strong
and
the
thing
which
pleases
us
whatever
is
formed
according
to
this
standard
pleases
us
be
it
house
song
discourse
verse
prose
woman
birds
rivers
trees
rooms
dress
etc
whatever
is
not
made
according
to
this
standard
displeases
those
who
have
good
taste
and
as
there
is
a
perfect
relation
between
a
song
and
a
house
which
are
made
after
a
good
model
because
they
are
like
this
good
model
though
each
after
its
kind
even
so
there
is
a
perfect
relation
between
things
made
after
a
bad
model
not
that
the
bad
model
is
unique
for
there
are
many
but
each
bad
sonnet
for
example
on
whatever
false
model
it
is
formed
is
just
like
a
woman
dressed
after
that
model
nothing
makes
us
understand
better
the
ridiculousness
of
a
false
sonnet
than
to
consider
nature
and
the
standard
and
then
to
imagine
a
woman
or
a
house
made
according
to
that
standard
as
we
speak
of
poetical
beauty
so
ought
we
to
speak
of
mathematical
beauty
and
medical
beauty
but
we
do
not
do
so
and
the
reason
is
that
we
know
well
what
is
the
object
of
mathematics
and
that
it
consists
in
proofs
and
what
is
the
object
of
medicine
and
that
it
consists
in
healing
but
we
do
not
know
in
what
grace
consists
which
is
the
object
of
poetry
we
do
not
know
the
natural
model
which
we
ought
to
imitate
and
through
lack
of
this
knowledge
we
have
coined
fantastic
terms
the
golden
age
the
wonder
of
our
times
fatal
and
call
this
jargon
poetical
beauty
but
whoever
imagines
a
woman
after
this
model
which
consists
in
saying
little
things
in
big
words
will
see
a
pretty
girl
adorned
with
mirrors
and
chains
at
whom
he
will
smile
because
we
know
better
wherein
consists
the
charm
of
woman
than
the
charm
of
verse
but
those
who
are
ignorant
would
admire
her
in
this
dress
and
there
are
many
villages
in
which
she
would
be
taken
for
the
queen
hence
we
call
sonnets
made
after
this
model
village
queens
no
one
passes
in
the
world
as
skilled
in
verse
unless
he
has
put
up
the
sign
of
a
poet
a
mathematician
etc
but
educated
people
do
not
want
a
sign
and
draw
little
distinction
between
the
trade
of
a
poet
and
that
of
an
embroiderer
people
of
education
are
not
called
poets
or
mathematicians
etc
but
they
are
all
these
and
judges
of
all
these
no
one
guesses
what
they
are
when
they
come
into
society
they
talk
on
matters
about
which
the
rest
are
talking
we
do
not
observe
in
them
one
quality
rather
than
another
save
when
they
have
to
make
use
of
it
but
then
we
remember
it
for
it
is
characteristic
of
such
persons
that
we
do
not
say
of
them
that
they
are
fine
speakers
when
it
is
not
a
question
of
oratory
and
that
we
say
of
them
that
they
are
fine
speakers
when
it
is
such
a
question
it
is
therefore
false
praise
to
give
a
man
when
we
say
of
him
on
his
entry
that
he
is
a
very
clever
poet
and
it
is
a
bad
sign
when
a
man
is
not
asked
to
give
his
judgment
on
some
verses
we
should
not
be
able
to
say
of
a
man
he
is
a
mathematician
or
a
preacher
or
eloquent
but
that
he
is
a
gentleman
that
universal
quality
alone
pleases
me
it
is
a
bad
sign
when
on
seeing
a
person
you
remember
his
book
i
would
prefer
you
to
see
no
quality
till
you
meet
it
and
have
occasion
to
use
it
quid
for
fear
some
one
quality
prevail
and
designate
the
man
let
none
think
him
a
fine
speaker
unless
oratory
be
in
question
and
then
let
them
think
it
man
is
full
of
wants
he
loves
only
those
who
can
satisfy
them
all
this
one
is
a
good
mathematician
one
will
say
but
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
mathematics
he
would
take
me
for
a
proposition
that
one
is
a
good
soldier
he
would
take
me
for
a
besieged
town
i
need
then
an
upright
man
who
can
accommodate
himself
generally
to
all
my
wants
since
we
can
not
be
universal
and
know
all
that
is
to
be
known
of
everything
we
ought
to
know
a
little
about
everything
for
it
is
far
better
to
know
something
about
everything
than
to
know
all
about
one
thing
this
universality
is
the
best
if
we
can
have
both
still
better
but
if
we
must
choose
we
ought
to
choose
the
former
and
the
world
feels
this
and
does
so
for
the
world
is
often
a
good
judge
a
poet
and
not
an
honest
man
if
lightning
fell
on
low
places
poets
and
those
who
can
only
reason
about
things
of
that
kind
would
lack
proofs
if
we
wished
to
prove
the
examples
which
we
take
to
prove
other
things
we
should
have
to
take
those
other
things
to
be
examples
for
as
we
always
believe
the
difficulty
is
in
what
we
wish
to
prove
we
find
the
examples
clearer
and
a
help
to
demonstration
thus
when
we
wish
to
demonstrate
a
general
theorem
we
must
give
the
rule
as
applied
to
a
particular
case
but
if
we
wish
to
demonstrate
a
particular
case
we
must
begin
with
the
general
rule
for
we
always
find
the
thing
obscure
which
we
wish
to
prove
and
that
clear
which
we
use
for
the
proof
for
when
a
thing
is
put
forward
to
be
proved
we
first
fill
ourselves
with
the
imagination
that
it
is
therefore
obscure
and
on
the
contrary
that
what
is
to
prove
it
is
clear
and
so
we
understand
it
easily
of
man
loves
malice
but
not
against
men
nor
the
unfortunate
but
against
the
fortunate
and
proud
people
are
mistaken
in
thinking
otherwise
for
lust
is
the
source
of
all
our
actions
and
humanity
etc
we
must
please
those
who
have
humane
and
tender
feelings
that
epigram
about
two
people
is
worthless
for
it
does
not
console
them
and
only
gives
a
point
to
the
author
glory
all
that
is
only
for
the
sake
of
the
author
is
worthless
recident
to
call
a
king
prince
is
pleasing
because
it
diminishes
his
rank
certain
authors
speaking
of
their
works
say
my
book
my
commentary
my
history
etc
they
resemble
people
who
have
a
house
of
their
own
and
always
have
my
house
on
their
tongue
they
would
do
better
to
say
our
book
our
commentary
our
history
because
there
is
in
them
usually
more
of
other
than
their
own
do
you
wish
people
to
believe
good
of
you
do
speak
languages
are
ciphers
wherein
letters
are
not
changed
into
letters
but
words
into
words
so
that
an
unknown
language
is
decipherable
a
maker
of
witticisms
a
bad
character
there
are
some
who
speak
well
and
write
badly
for
the
place
and
the
audience
warm
them
and
draw
from
their
minds
more
than
they
think
of
without
that
warmth
when
we
find
words
repeated
in
a
discourse
and
in
trying
to
correct
them
discover
that
they
are
so
appropriate
that
we
would
spoil
the
discourse
we
must
leave
them
alone
this
is
the
test
and
our
attempt
is
the
work
of
envy
which
is
blind
and
does
not
see
that
repetition
is
not
in
this
place
a
fault
for
there
is
no
general
rule
to
mask
nature
and
disguise
her
no
more
king
pope
bishop
but
etc
not
paris

of

places
in
which
we
ought
to
call
paris

others
in
which

the
same

with
the
words
which
express

their
dignity
from

giving

it

i

a
great

i
am
afraid
i

excuse
i
would

i
might
well
have
taken
this

in
an
order
like
this
to
show
the

all

of

to
show
the
vanity
of

the

the
order
would
not

what
it
is

how

people
understand
it
no
human
science
can
keep
it
saint
thomas
did
not
keep
it
mathematics
keep
it
but
they
are
useless
on
account
of
their
depth
to
the
first
to
speak
of
those
who
have
treated
of
the
knowledge
of
self
of
the
divisions
of
charron
which
sadden
and
weary
us
of
the
confusion
of
montaigne
that
he
was
quite
aware
of
his
want
of
method
and
shunned
it
by
jumping
from
subject
to
subject
that
he
sought
to
be
fashionable
his
foolish
project
of
describing
himself
and
this
not
casually
and
against
his
maxims
since
every
one
makes
mistakes
but
by
his
maxims
themselves
and
by
first
and
chief
design
for
to
say
silly
things
by
chance
and
weakness
is
a
common
misfortune
but
to
say
them
intentionally
is
intolerable
and
to
say
such
as
that
montaigne
faults
are
great
lewd
words
this
is
bad
notwithstanding
mademoiselle
de
gournay
credulous
without
ignorant
the
circle
a
greater
his
opinions
on
suicide
on
death
he
suggests
an
indifference
about
salvation
fear
and
without
as
his
book
was
not
written
with
a
religious
purpose
he
was
not
bound
to
mention
religion
but
it
is
always
our
duty
not
to
turn
men
from
it
one
can
excuse
his
rather
free
and
licentious
opinions
on
some
relations
of
life
but
one
can
not
excuse
his
thoroughly
pagan
views
on
death
for
a
man
must
renounce
piety
altogether
if
he
does
not
at
least
wish
to
die
like
a
christian
now
through
the
whole
of
his
book
his
only
conception
of
death
is
a
cowardly
and
effeminate
one
it
is
not
in
montaigne
but
in
myself
that
i
find
all
that
i
see
in
him
what
good
there
is
in
montaigne
can
only
have
been
acquired
with
difficulty
the
evil
that
is
in
him
i
mean
apart
from
his
morality
could
have
been
corrected
in
a
moment
if
he
had
been
informed
that
he
made
too
much
of
trifles
and
spoke
too
much
of
himself
one
must
know
oneself
if
this
does
not
serve
to
discover
truth
it
at
least
serves
as
a
rule
of
life
and
there
is
nothing
better
vanity
of
the
physical
science
will
not
console
me
for
the
ignorance
of
morality
in
the
time
of
affliction
but
the
science
of
ethics
will
always
console
me
for
the
ignorance
of
the
physical
sciences
men
are
never
taught
to
be
gentlemen
and
are
taught
everything
else
and
they
never
plume
themselves
so
much
on
the
rest
of
their
knowledge
as
on
knowing
how
to
be
gentlemen
they
only
plume
themselves
on
knowing
the
one
thing
they
do
not
know
infinites
the
when
we
read
too
fast
or
too
slowly
we
understand
nothing
nature
has
set
us
so
well
in
the
centre
that
if
we
change
one
side
of
the
balance
we
change
the
other
also
τά
ζῶα
τρέχει
this
makes
me
believe
that
the
springs
in
our
brain
are
so
adjusted
that
he
who
touches
one
touches
also
its
contrary
too
much
and
too
little
wine
give
him
none
he
can
not
find
truth
give
him
too
much
the
same
this
is
where
our
innate
knowledge
leads
us
if
it
be
not
true
there
is
no
truth
in
man
and
if
it
be
true
he
finds
therein
great
cause
for
humiliation
being
compelled
to
abase
himself
in
one
way
or
another
and
since
he
can
not
exist
without
this
knowledge
i
wish
that
before
entering
on
deeper
researches
into
nature
he
would
consider
her
both
seriously
and
at
leisure
that
he
would
reflect
upon
himself
also
and
knowing
what
proportion
there
is
let
man
then
contemplate
the
whole
of
nature
in
her
full
and
grand
majesty
and
turn
his
vision
from
the
low
objects
which
surround
him
let
him
gaze
on
that
brilliant
light
set
like
an
eternal
lamp
to
illumine
the
universe
let
the
earth
appear
to
him
a
point
in
comparison
with
the
vast
circle
described
by
the
sun
and
let
him
wonder
at
the
fact
that
this
vast
circle
is
itself
but
a
very
fine
point
in
comparison
with
that
described
by
the
stars
in
their
revolution
round
the
firmament
but
if
our
view
be
arrested
there
let
our
imagination
pass
beyond
it
will
sooner
exhaust
the
power
of
conception
than
nature
that
of
supplying
material
for
conception
the
whole
visible
world
is
only
an
imperceptible
atom
in
the
ample
bosom
of
nature
no
idea
approaches
it
we
may
enlarge
our
conceptions
beyond
all
imaginable
space
we
only
produce
atoms
in
comparison
with
the
reality
of
things
it
is
an
infinite
sphere
the
centre
of
which
is
everywhere
the
circumference
nowhere
in
short
it
is
the
greatest
sensible
mark
of
the
almighty
power
of
god
that
imagination
loses
itself
in
that
thought
returning
to
himself
let
man
consider
what
he
is
in
comparison
with
all
existence
let
him
regard
himself
as
lost
in
this
remote
corner
of
nature
and
from
the
little
cell
in
which
he
finds
himself
lodged
i
mean
the
universe
let
him
estimate
at
their
true
value
the
earth
kingdoms
cities
and
himself
what
is
a
man
in
the
infinite
but
to
show
him
another
prodigy
equally
astonishing
let
him
examine
the
most
delicate
things
he
knows
let
a
mite
be
given
him
with
its
minute
body
and
parts
incomparably
more
minute
limbs
with
their
joints
veins
in
the
limbs
blood
in
the
veins
humours
in
the
blood
drops
in
the
humours
vapours
in
the
drops
dividing
these
last
things
again
let
him
exhaust
his
powers
of
conception
and
let
the
last
object
at
which
he
can
arrive
be
now
that
of
our
discourse
perhaps
he
will
think
that
here
is
the
smallest
point
in
nature
i
will
let
him
see
therein
a
new
abyss
i
will
paint
for
him
not
only
the
visible
universe
but
all
that
he
can
conceive
of
nature
immensity
in
the
womb
of
this
abridged
atom
let
him
see
therein
an
infinity
of
universes
each
of
which
has
its
firmament
its
planets
its
earth
in
the
same
proportion
as
in
the
visible
world
in
each
earth
animals
and
in
the
last
mites
in
which
he
will
find
again
all
that
the
first
had
finding
still
in
these
others
the
same
thing
without
end
and
without
cessation
let
him
lose
himself
in
wonders
as
amazing
in
their
littleness
as
the
others
in
their
vastness
for
who
will
not
be
astounded
at
the
fact
that
our
body
which
a
little
while
ago
was
imperceptible
in
the
universe
itself
imperceptible
in
the
bosom
of
the
whole
is
now
a
colossus
a
world
or
rather
a
whole
in
respect
of
the
nothingness
which
we
can
not
reach
he
who
regards
himself
in
this
light
will
be
afraid
of
himself
and
observing
himself
sustained
in
the
body
given
him
by
nature
between
those
two
abysses
of
the
infinite
and
nothing
will
tremble
at
the
sight
of
these
marvels
and
i
think
that
as
his
curiosity
changes
into
admiration
he
will
be
more
disposed
to
contemplate
them
in
silence
than
to
examine
them
with
presumption
for
in
fact
what
is
man
in
nature
a
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
infinite
an
all
in
comparison
with
the
nothing
a
mean
between
nothing
and
everything
since
he
is
infinitely
removed
from
comprehending
the
extremes
the
end
of
things
and
their
beginning
are
hopelessly
hidden
from
him
in
an
impenetrable
secret
he
is
equally
incapable
of
seeing
the
nothing
from
which
he
was
made
and
the
infinite
in
which
he
is
swallowed
up
what
will
he
do
then
but
perceive
the
appearance
of
the
middle
of
things
in
an
eternal
despair
of
knowing
either
their
beginning
or
their
end
all
things
proceed
from
the
nothing
and
are
borne
towards
the
infinite
who
will
follow
these
marvellous
processes
the
author
of
these
wonders
understands
them
none
other
can
do
so
through
failure
to
contemplate
these
infinites
men
have
rashly
rushed
into
the
examination
of
nature
as
though
they
bore
some
proportion
to
her
it
is
strange
that
they
have
wished
to
understand
the
beginnings
of
things
and
thence
to
arrive
at
the
knowledge
of
the
whole
with
a
presumption
as
infinite
as
their
object
for
surely
this
design
can
not
be
formed
without
presumption
or
without
a
capacity
infinite
like
nature
if
we
are
well
informed
we
understand
that
as
nature
has
graven
her
image
and
that
of
her
author
on
all
things
they
almost
all
partake
of
her
double
infinity
thus
we
see
that
all
the
sciences
are
infinite
in
the
extent
of
their
researches
for
who
doubts
that
geometry
for
instance
has
an
infinite
infinity
of
problems
to
solve
they
are
also
infinite
in
the
multitude
and
fineness
of
their
premises
for
it
is
clear
that
those
which
are
put
forward
as
ultimate
are
not
but
are
based
on
others
which
again
having
others
for
their
support
do
not
permit
of
finality
but
we
represent
some
as
ultimate
for
reason
in
the
same
way
as
in
regard
to
material
objects
we
call
that
an
indivisible
point
beyond
which
our
senses
can
no
longer
perceive
anything
although
by
its
nature
it
is
infinitely
divisible
of
these
two
infinites
of
science
that
of
greatness
is
the
most
palpable
and
hence
a
few
persons
have
pretended
to
know
all
things
i
will
speak
of
the
whole
said
democritus
but
the
infinitely
little
is
the
least
obvious
philosophers
have
much
oftener
claimed
to
have
reached
it
and
it
is
here
they
have
all
stumbled
this
has
given
rise
to
such
common
titles
as
of
and
the
like
as
ostentatious
in
fact
though
not
in
appearance
as
that
one
which
blinds
us
omni
we
naturally
believe
ourselves
far
more
capable
of
reaching
the
centre
of
things
than
of
embracing
their
circumference
the
visible
extent
of
the
world
visibly
exceeds
us
but
as
we
exceed
little
things
we
think
ourselves
more
capable
of
knowing
them
and
yet
we
need
no
less
capacity
for
attaining
the
nothing
than
the
all
infinite
capacity
is
required
for
both
and
it
seems
to
me
that
whoever
shall
have
understood
the
ultimate
principles
of
being
might
also
attain
to
the
knowledge
of
the
infinite
the
one
depends
on
the
other
and
one
leads
to
the
other
these
extremes
meet
and
reunite
by
force
of
distance
and
find
each
other
in
god
and
in
god
alone
let
us
then
take
our
compass
we
are
something
and
we
are
not
everything
the
nature
of
our
existence
hides
from
us
the
knowledge
of
first
beginnings
which
are
born
of
the
nothing
and
the
littleness
of
our
being
conceals
from
us
the
sight
of
the
infinite
our
intellect
holds
the
same
position
in
the
world
of
thought
as
our
body
occupies
in
the
expanse
of
nature
limited
as
we
are
in
every
way
this
state
which
holds
the
mean
between
two
extremes
is
present
in
all
our
impotence
our
senses
perceive
no
extreme
too
much
sound
deafens
us
too
much
light
dazzles
us
too
great
distance
or
proximity
hinders
our
view
too
great
length
and
too
great
brevity
of
discourse
tend
to
obscurity
too
much
truth
is
paralysing
i
know
some
who
can
not
understand
that
to
take
four
from
nothing
leaves
nothing
first
principles
are
too
for
us
too
much
pleasure
disagrees
with
us
too
many
concords
are
annoying
in
music
too
many
benefits
irritate
us
we
wish
to
have
the
wherewithal
to
our
debts
eo
usque
læta

dum
videntur

ubi

we
feel
neither
extreme
heat
nor
extreme
cold
excessive
qualities
are
prejudicial
to
us
and
not
perceptible
by
the
senses
we
do
not
feel
but
suffer
them
extreme
youth
and
extreme
age
hinder
the
mind
as
also
too
much
and
too
little
education
in
short
extremes
are
for
us
as
though
they
were
not
and
we
are
not
within
their
notice
they
escape
us
or
we
them
this
is
our
true
state
this
is
what
makes
us
incapable
of
certain
knowledge
and
of
absolute
ignorance
we
sail
within
a
vast
sphere
ever
drifting
in
uncertainty
driven
from
end
to
end
when
we
think
to
attach
ourselves
to
any
point
and
to
fasten
to
it
it
wavers
and
leaves
us
and
if
we
follow
it
it
eludes
our
grasp
slips
past
us
and
vanishes
for
ever
nothing
stays
for
us
this
is
our
natural
condition
and
yet
most
contrary
to
our
inclination
we
burn
with
desire
to
find
solid
ground
and
an
ultimate
sure
foundation
whereon
to
build
a
tower
reaching
to
the
infinite
but
our
whole
groundwork
cracks
and
the
earth
opens
to
abysses
let
us
therefore
not
look
for
certainty
and
stability
our
reason
is
always
deceived
by
fickle
shadows
nothing
can
fix
the
finite
between
the
two
infinites
which
both
enclose
and
fly
from
it
if
this
be
well
understood
i
think
that
we
shall
remain
at
rest
each
in
the
state
wherein
nature
has
placed
him
as
this
sphere
which
has
fallen
to
us
as
our
lot
is
always
distant
from
either
extreme
what
matters
it
that
man
should
have
a
little
more
knowledge
of
the
universe
if
he
has
it
he
but
gets
a
little
higher
is
he
not
always
infinitely
removed
from
the
end
and
is
not
the
duration
of
our
life
equally
removed
from
eternity
even
if
it
lasts
ten
years
longer
in
comparison
with
these
infinites
all
finites
are
equal
and
i
see
no
reason
for
fixing
our
imagination
on
one
more
than
on
another
the
only
comparison
which
we
make
of
ourselves
to
the
finite
is
painful
to
us
if
man
made
himself
the
first
object
of
study
he
would
see
how
incapable
he
is
of
going
further
how
can
a
part
know
the
whole
but
he
may
perhaps
aspire
to
know
at
least
the
parts
to
which
he
bears
some
proportion
but
the
parts
of
the
world
are
all
so
related
and
linked
to
one
another
that
i
believe
it
impossible
to
know
one
without
the
other
and
without
the
whole
man
for
instance
is
related
to
all
he
knows
he
needs
a
place
wherein
to
abide
time
through
which
to
live
motion
in
order
to
live
elements
to
compose
him
warmth
and
food
to
nourish
him
air
to
breathe
he
sees
light
he
feels
bodies
in
short
he
is
in
a
dependent
alliance
with
everything
to
know
man
then
it
is
necessary
to
know
how
it
happens
that
he
needs
air
to
live
and
to
know
the
air
we
must
know
how
it
is
thus
related
to
the
life
of
man
etc
flame
can
not
exist
without
air
therefore
to
understand
the
one
we
must
understand
the
other
since
everything
then
is
cause
and
effect
dependent
and
supporting
mediate
and
immediate
and
all
is
held
together
by
a
natural
though
imperceptible
chain
which
binds
together
things
most
distant
and
most
different
i
hold
it
equally
impossible
to
know
the
parts
without
knowing
the
whole
and
to
know
the
whole
without
knowing
the
parts
in
detail
the
eternity
of
things
in
itself
or
in
god
must
also
astonish
our
brief
duration
the
fixed
and
constant
immobility
of
nature
in
comparison
with
the
continual
change
which
goes
on
within
us
must
have
the
same
effect
and
what
completes
our
incapability
of
knowing
things
is
the
fact
that
they
are
simple
and
that
we
are
composed
of
two
opposite
natures
different
in
kind
soul
and
body
for
it
is
impossible
that
our
rational
part
should
be
other
than
spiritual
and
if
any
one
maintain
that
we
are
simply
corporeal
this
would
far
more
exclude
us
from
the
knowledge
of
things
there
being
nothing
so
inconceivable
as
to
say
that
matter
knows
itself
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
how
it
should
know
itself
so
if
we
are
simply
material
we
can
know
nothing
at
all
and
if
we
are
composed
of
mind
and
matter
we
can
not
know
perfectly
things
which
are
simple
whether
spiritual
or
corporeal
hence
it
comes
that
almost
all
philosophers
have
confused
ideas
of
things
and
speak
of
material
things
in
spiritual
terms
and
of
spiritual
things
in
material
terms
for
they
say
boldly
that
bodies
have
a
tendency
to
fall
that
they
seek
after
their
centre
that
they
fly
from
destruction
that
they
fear
the
void
that
they
have
inclinations
sympathies
antipathies
all
of
which
attributes
pertain
only
to
mind
and
in
speaking
of
minds
they
consider
them
as
in
a
place
and
attribute
to
them
movement
from
one
place
to
another
and
these
are
qualities
which
belong
only
to
bodies
instead
of
receiving
the
ideas
of
these
things
in
their
purity
we
colour
them
with
our
own
qualities
and
stamp
with
our
composite
being
all
the
simple
things
which
we
contemplate
who
would
not
think
seeing
us
compose
all
things
of
mind
and
body
but
that
this
mixture
would
be
quite
intelligible
to
us
yet
it
is
the
very
thing
we
least
understand
man
is
to
himself
the
most
wonderful
object
in
nature
for
he
can
not
conceive
what
the
body
is
still
less
what
the
mind
is
and
least
of
all
how
a
body
should
be
united
to
a
mind
this
is
the
consummation
of
his
difficulties
and
yet
it
is
his
very
being
quo
corporibus
adhærent
spiritus
comprehendi
ab
hominibus
non
potest
et
hoc
tamen
homo
finally
to
complete
the
proof
of
our
weakness
i
shall
conclude
with
these
two
considerations
but
perhaps
this
subject
goes
beyond
the
capacity
of
reason
let
us
therefore
examine
her
solutions
to
problems
within
her
powers
if
there
be
anything
to
which
her
own
interest
must
have
made
her
apply
herself
most
seriously
it
is
the
inquiry
into
her
own
sovereign
good
let
us
see
then
wherein
these
strong
and
souls
have
placed
it
and
whether
they
agree
one
says
that
the
sovereign
good
consists
in
virtue
another
in
pleasure
another
in
the
knowledge
of
nature
another
in
truth
qui
potuit
rerum
cognoscere
another
in
total
ignorance
another
in
indolence
others
in
disregarding
appearances
another
in
wondering
at
nothing
admirari
prope
res
una
quæ
possit
facere
et
servare
and
the
true
sceptics
in
their
indifference
doubt
and
perpetual
suspense
and
others
wiser
think
to
find
a
better
definition
we
are
well
satisfied
transpose
after
the
laws
to
the
following
we
must
see
if
this
fine
philosophy
have
gained
nothing
certain
from
so
long
and
so
intent
study
perhaps
at
least
the
soul
will
know
itself
let
us
hear
the
rulers
of
the
world
on
this
subject
what
have
they
thought
of
her
substance
have
they
been
more
fortunate
in
locating
her
what
have
they
found
out
about
her
origin
duration
and
departure
is
then
the
soul
too
noble
a
subject
for
their
feeble
lights
let
us
then
abase
her
to
matter
and
see
if
she
knows
whereof
is
made
the
very
body
which
she
animates
and
those
others
which
she
contemplates
and
moves
at
her
will
what
have
those
great
dogmatists
who
are
ignorant
of
nothing
known
of
this
matter
this
would
doubtless
suffice
if
reason
were
reasonable
she
is
reasonable
enough
to
admit
that
she
has
been
unable
to
find
anything
durable
but
she
does
not
yet
despair
of
reaching
it
she
is
as
ardent
as
ever
in
this
search
and
is
confident
she
has
within
her
the
necessary
powers
for
this
conquest
we
must
therefore
conclude
and
after
having
examined
her
powers
in
their
effects
observe
them
in
themselves
and
see
if
she
has
a
nature
and
a
grasp
capable
of
laying
hold
of
the
truth
a
letter
the
foolishness
of
human
knowledge
and
this
letter
before
qui
potuit
nihil
kinds
of
sovereign
good
in
montaigne
part
i
section
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
put
the
case
a
stage
lower
and
make
it
appear
ridiculous
to
begin
at
the
very
beginning
what
is
more
absurd
than
to
say
that
lifeless
bodies
have
passions
fears
hatreds
that
insensible
bodies
lifeless
and
incapable
of
life
have
passions
which
presuppose
at
least
a
sensitive
soul
to
feel
them
nay
more
that
the
object
of
their
dread
is
the
void
what
is
there
in
the
void
that
could
make
them
afraid
nothing
is
more
shallow
and
ridiculous
this
is
not
all
it
is
said
that
they
have
in
themselves
a
source
of
movement
to
shun
the
void
have
they
arms
legs
muscles
nerves
to
write
against
those
who
made
too
profound
a
study
of
science
descartes
i
can
not
forgive
descartes
in
all
his
philosophy
he
would
have
been
quite
willing
to
dispense
with
god
but
he
had
to
make
him
give
a
fillip
to
set
the
world
in
motion
beyond
this
he
has
no
further
need
of
god
descartes
useless
and
uncertain
we
must
say
summarily
this
is
made
by
figure
and
motion
for
it
is
true
but
to
say
what
these
are
and
to
compose
the
machine
is
ridiculous
for
it
is
useless
uncertain
and
painful
and
were
it
true
we
do
not
think
all
philosophy
is
worth
one
hour
of
pain
how
comes
it
that
a
cripple
does
not
offend
us
but
that
a
fool
does
because
a
cripple
recognises
that
we
walk
straight
whereas
a
fool
declares
that
it
is
we
who
are
silly
if
it
were
not
so
we
should
feel
pity
and
not
anger
epictetus
asks
still
more
strongly
why
are
we
not
angry
if
we
are
told
that
we
have
a
headache
and
why
are
we
angry
if
we
are
told
that
we
reason
badly
or
choose
wrongly
the
reason
is
that
we
are
quite
certain
that
we
have
not
a
headache
or
are
not
lame
but
we
are
not
so
sure
that
we
make
a
true
choice
so
having
assurance
only
because
we
see
with
our
whole
sight
it
puts
us
into
suspense
and
surprise
when
another
with
his
whole
sight
sees
the
opposite
and
still
more
so
when
a
thousand
others
deride
our
choice
for
we
must
prefer
our
own
lights
to
those
of
so
many
others
and
that
is
bold
and
difficult
there
is
never
this
contradiction
in
the
feelings
towards
a
cripple
it
is
natural
for
the
mind
to
believe
and
for
the
will
to
love
so
that
for
want
of
true
objects
they
must
attach
themselves
to
false
it
is
that
deceitful
part
in
man
that
mistress
of
error
and
falsity
the
more
deceptive
that
she
is
not
always
so
for
she
would
be
an
infallible
rule
of
truth
if
she
were
an
infallible
rule
of
falsehood
but
being
most
generally
false
she
gives
no
sign
of
her
nature
impressing
the
same
character
on
the
true
and
the
false
i
do
not
speak
of
fools
i
speak
of
the
wisest
men
and
it
is
among
them
that
the
imagination
has
the
great
gift
of
persuasion
reason
protests
in
vain
it
can
not
set
a
true
value
on
things
this
arrogant
power
the
enemy
of
reason
who
likes
to
rule
and
dominate
it
has
established
in
man
a
second
nature
to
show
how
she
is
she
makes
men
happy
and
sad
healthy
and
sick
rich
and
poor
she
compels
reason
to
believe
doubt
and
deny
she
blunts
the
senses
or
quickens
them
she
has
her
fools
and
sages
and
nothing
vexes
us
more
than
to
see
that
she
fills
her
devotees
with
a
satisfaction
far
more
full
and
entire
than
does
reason
those
who
have
a
lively
imagination
are
a
great
deal
more
pleased
with
themselves
than
the
wise
can
reasonably
be
they
look
down
upon
men
with
haughtiness
they
argue
with
boldness
and
confidence
others
with
fear
and
diffidence
and
this
gaiety
of
countenance
often
gives
them
the
advantage
in
the
opinion
of
the
hearers
such
favour
have
the
imaginary
wise
in
the
eyes
of
judges
of
like
nature
imagination
can
not
make
fools
wise
but
she
can
make
them
happy
to
the
envy
of
reason
which
can
only
make
its
friends
miserable
the
one
covers
them
with
glory
the
other
with
shame
what
but
this
faculty
of
imagination
dispenses
reputation
awards
respect
and
veneration
to
persons
works
laws
and
the
great
how
insufficient
are
all
the
riches
of
the
earth
without
her
consent
would
you
not
say
that
this
magistrate
whose
venerable
age
commands
the
respect
of
a
whole
people
is
governed
by
pure
and
lofty
reason
and
that
he
judges
causes
according
to
their
true
nature
without
considering
those
mere
trifles
which
only
affect
the
imagination
of
the
weak
see
him
go
to
sermon
full
of
devout
zeal
strengthening
his
reason
with
the
ardour
of
his
love
he
is
ready
to
listen
with
exemplary
respect
let
the
preacher
appear
and
let
nature
have
given
him
a
hoarse
voice
or
a
comical
cast
of
countenance
or
let
his
barber
have
given
him
a
bad
shave
or
let
by
chance
his
dress
be
more
dirtied
than
usual
then
however
great
the
truths
he
announces
i
wager
our
senator
loses
his
gravity
if
the
greatest
philosopher
in
the
world
find
himself
upon
a
plank
wider
than
actually
necessary
but
hanging
over
a
precipice
his
imagination
will
prevail
though
his
reason
convince
him
of
his
safety
many
can
not
bear
the
thought
without
a
cold
sweat
i
will
not
state
all
its
effects
every
one
knows
that
the
sight
of
cats
or
rats
the
crushing
of
a
coal
etc
may
unhinge
the
reason
the
tone
of
voice
affects
the
wisest
and
changes
the
force
of
a
discourse
or
a
poem
love
or
hate
alters
the
aspect
of
justice
how
much
greater
confidence
has
an
advocate
retained
with
a
large
fee
in
the
justice
of
his
cause
how
much
better
does
his
bold
manner
make
his
case
appear
to
the
judges
deceived
as
they
are
by
appearances
how
ludicrous
is
reason
blown
with
a
breath
in
every
direction
i
should
have
to
enumerate
almost
every
action
of
men
who
scarce
waver
save
under
her
assaults
for
reason
has
been
obliged
to
yield
and
the
wisest
reason
takes
as
her
own
principles
those
which
the
imagination
of
man
has
everywhere
rashly
introduced
he
who
would
follow
reason
only
would
be
deemed
foolish
by
the
generality
of
men
we
must
judge
by
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
mankind
because
it
has
pleased
them
we
must
work
all
day
for
pleasures
seen
to
be
imaginary
and
after
sleep
has
refreshed
our
tired
reason
we
must
forthwith
start
up
and
rush
after
phantoms
and
suffer
the
impressions
of
this
mistress
of
the
world
this
is
one
of
the
sources
of
error
but
it
is
not
the
only
one
our
magistrates
have
known
well
this
mystery
their
red
robes
the
ermine
in
which
they
wrap
themselves
like
furry
cats
the
courts
in
which
they
administer
justice
the
and
all
such
august
apparel
were
necessary
if
the
physicians
had
not
their
cassocks
and
their
mules
if
the
doctors
had
not
their
square
caps
and
their
robes
four
times
too
wide
they
would
never
have
duped
the
world
which
can
not
resist
so
original
an
appearance
if
magistrates
had
true
justice
and
if
physicians
had
the
true
art
of
healing
they
would
have
no
occasion
for
square
caps
the
majesty
of
these
sciences
would
of
itself
be
venerable
enough
but
having
only
imaginary
knowledge
they
must
employ
those
silly
tools
that
strike
the
imagination
with
which
they
have
to
deal
and
thereby
in
fact
they
inspire
respect
soldiers
alone
are
not
disguised
in
this
manner
because
indeed
their
part
is
the
most
essential
they
establish
themselves
by
force
the
others
by
show
therefore
our
kings
seek
out
no
disguises
they
do
not
mask
themselves
in
extraordinary
costumes
to
appear
such
but
they
are
accompanied
by
guards
and
halberdiers
those
armed
and
puppets
who
have
hands
and
power
for
them
alone
those
trumpets
and
drums
which
go
before
them
and
those
legions
round
about
them
make
the
stoutest
tremble
they
have
not
dress
only
they
have
might
a
very
refined
reason
is
required
to
regard
as
an
ordinary
man
the
grand
turk
in
his
superb
seraglio
surrounded
by
forty
thousand
janissaries
we
can
not
even
see
an
advocate
in
his
robe
and
with
his
cap
on
his
head
without
a
favourable
opinion
of
his
ability
the
imagination
disposes
of
everything
it
makes
beauty
justice
and
happiness
which
is
everything
in
the
world
i
should
much
like
to
see
an
italian
work
of
which
i
only
know
the
title
which
alone
is
worth
many
books
opinione
regina
del
i
approve
of
the
book
without
knowing
it
save
the
evil
in
it
if
any
these
are
pretty
much
the
effects
of
that
deceptive
faculty
which
seems
to
have
been
expressly
given
us
to
lead
us
into
necessary
error
we
have
however
many
other
sources
of
error
not
only
are
old
impressions
capable
of
misleading
us
the
charms
of
novelty
have
the
same
power
hence
arise
all
the
disputes
of
men
who
taunt
each
other
either
with
following
the
false
impressions
of
childhood
or
with
running
rashly
after
the
new
who
keeps
the
due
mean
let
him
appear
and
prove
it
there
is
no
principle
however
natural
to
us
from
infancy
which
may
not
be
made
to
pass
for
a
false
impression
either
of
education
or
of
sense
because
say
some
you
have
believed
from
childhood
that
a
box
was
empty
when
you
saw
nothing
in
it
you
have
believed
in
the
possibility
of
a
vacuum
this
is
an
illusion
of
your
senses
strengthened
by
custom
which
science
must
correct
because
say
others
you
have
been
taught
at
school
that
there
is
no
vacuum
you
have
perverted
your
common
sense
which
clearly
comprehended
it
and
you
must
correct
this
by
returning
to
your
first
state
which
has
deceived
you
your
senses
or
your
education
we
have
another
source
of
error
in
diseases
they
spoil
the
judgment
and
the
senses
and
if
the
more
serious
produce
a
sensible
change
i
do
not
doubt
that
slighter
ills
produce
a
proportionate
impression
our
own
interest
is
again
a
marvellous
instrument
for
nicely
putting
out
our
eyes
the
justest
man
in
the
world
is
not
allowed
to
be
judge
in
his
own
cause
i
know
some
who
in
order
not
to
fall
into
this
have
been
perfectly
unjust
out
of
opposition
the
sure
way
of
losing
a
just
cause
has
been
to
get
it
recommended
to
these
men
by
their
near
relatives
justice
and
truth
are
two
such
subtle
points
that
our
tools
are
too
blunt
to
touch
them
accurately
if
they
reach
the
point
they
either
crush
it
or
lean
all
round
more
on
the
false
than
on
the
true
man
is
so
happily
formed
that
he
has
no
good
of
the
true
and
several
excellent
of
the
false
let
us
now
see
how
much
but
the
most
powerful
cause
of
error
is
the
war
existing
between
the
senses
and
reason
must
thus
begin
the
chapter
on
the
deceptive
man
is
only
a
subject
full
of
error
natural
and
ineffaceable
without
grace
nothing
shows
him
the
truth
everything
deceives
him
these
two
sources
of
truth
reason
and
the
senses
besides
being
both
wanting
in
sincerity
deceive
each
other
in
turn
the
senses
mislead
the
reason
with
false
appearances
and
receive
from
reason
in
their
turn
the
same
trickery
which
they
apply
to
her
reason
has
her
revenge
the
passions
of
the
soul
trouble
the
senses
and
make
false
impressions
upon
them
they
rival
each
other
in
falsehood
and
deception
but
besides
those
errors
which
arise
accidentally
and
through
lack
of
intelligence
with
these
heterogeneous
faculties
the
imagination
enlarges
little
objects
so
as
to
fill
our
souls
with
a
fantastic
estimate
and
with
rash
insolence
it
belittles
the
great
to
its
own
measure
as
when
talking
of
god
things
which
have
most
hold
on
us
as
the
concealment
of
our
few
possessions
are
often
a
mere
nothing
it
is
a
nothing
which
our
imagination
magnifies
into
a
mountain
another
turn
of
the
imagination
would
make
us
discover
this
without
difficulty
my
fancy
makes
me
hate
a
croaker
and
one
who
pants
when
eating
fancy
has
great
weight
shall
we
profit
by
it
shall
we
yield
to
this
weight
because
it
is
natural
no
but
by
resisting
it

children
who
are
frightened
at
the
face
they
have
blackened
are
but
children
but
how
shall
one
who
is
so
weak
in
his
childhood
become
really
strong
when
he
grows
older
we
only
change
our
fancies
all
that
is
made
perfect
by
progress
perishes
also
by
progress
all
that
has
been
weak
can
never
become
absolutely
strong
we
say
in
vain
he
has
grown
he
has
changed
he
is
also
the
same
custom
is
our
nature
he
who
is
accustomed
to
the
faith
believes
in
it
can
no
longer
fear
hell
and
believes
in
nothing
else
he
who
is
accustomed
to
believe
that
the
king
is
terrible
etc
who
doubts
then
that
our
soul
being
accustomed
to
see
number
space
motion
believes
that
and
nothing
else
crebro

when
we
see
the
same
effect
always
recur
we
infer
a
natural
necessity
in
it
as
that
there
will
be
a
etc
but
nature
often
deceives
us
and
does
not
subject
herself
to
her
own
rules
what
are
our
natural
principles
but
principles
of
custom
in
children
they
are
those
which
they
have
received
from
the
habits
of
their
fathers
as
hunting
in
animals
a
different
custom
will
cause
different
natural
principles
this
is
seen
in
experience
and
if
there
are
some
natural
principles
ineradicable
by
custom
there
are
also
some
customs
opposed
to
nature
ineradicable
by
nature
or
by
a
second
custom
this
depends
on
disposition
parents
fear
lest
the
natural
love
of
their
children
may
fade
away
what
kind
of
nature
is
that
which
is
subject
to
decay
custom
is
a
second
nature
which
destroys
the
former
but
what
is
nature
for
is
custom
not
natural
i
am
much
afraid
that
nature
is
itself
only
a
first
custom
as
custom
is
a
second
nature
the
nature
of
man
is
wholly
natural
there
is
nothing
he
may
not
make
natural
there
is
nothing
natural
he
may
not
lose
memory
joy
are
intuitions
and
even
mathematical
propositions
become
intuitions
for
education
produces
natural
intuitions
and
natural
intuitions
are
erased
by
education
when
we
are
accustomed
to
use
bad
reasons
for
proving
natural
effects
we
are
not
willing
to
receive
good
reasons
when
they
are
discovered
an
example
may
be
given
from
the
circulation
of
the
blood
as
a
reason
why
the
vein
swells
below
the
ligature
the
most
important
affair
in
life
is
the
choice
of
a
calling
chance
decides
it
custom
makes
men
masons
soldiers
slaters
he
is
a
good
slater
says
one
and
speaking
of
soldiers
remarks
they
are
perfect
fools
but
others
affirm
there
is
nothing
great
but
war
the
rest
of
men
are
good
for
nothing
we
choose
our
callings
according
as
we
hear
this
or
that
praised
or
despised
in
our
childhood
for
we
naturally
love
truth
and
hate
folly
these
words
move
us
the
only
error
is
in
their
application
so
great
is
the
force
of
custom
that
out
of
those
whom
nature
has
only
made
men
are
created
all
conditions
of
men
for
some
districts
are
full
of
masons
others
of
soldiers
etc
certainly
nature
is
not
so
uniform
it
is
custom
then
which
does
this
for
it
constrains
nature
but
sometimes
nature
gains
the
ascendancy
and
preserves
instinct
in
spite
of
all
custom
good
or
bad
leading
to
it
is
a
deplorable
thing
to
see
all
men
deliberating
on
means
alone
and
not
on
the
end
each
thinks
how
he
will
acquit
himself
in
his
condition
but
as
for
the
choice
of
condition
or
of
country
chance
gives
them
to
us
it
is
a
pitiable
thing
to
see
so
many
turks
heretics
and
infidels
follow
the
way
of
their
fathers
for
the
sole
reason
that
each
has
been
imbued
with
the
prejudice
that
it
is
the
best
and
that
fixes
for
each
man
his
conditions
of
locksmith
soldier
etc
hence
savages
care
nothing
for
providence
there
is
an
universal
and
essential
difference
between
the
actions
of
the
will
and
all
other
actions
the
will
is
one
of
the
chief
factors
in
belief
not
that
it
creates
belief
but
because
things
are
true
or
false
according
to
the
aspect
in
which
we
look
at
them
the
will
which
prefers
one
aspect
to
another
turns
away
the
mind
from
considering
the
qualities
of
all
that
it
does
not
like
to
see
and
thus
the
mind
moving
in
accord
with
the
will
stops
to
consider
the
aspect
which
it
likes
and
so
judges
by
what
it
sees
the
nature
of
and
of
this
human
ego
is
to
love
self
only
and
consider
self
only
but
what
will
man
do
he
can
not
prevent
this
object
that
he
loves
from
being
full
of
faults
and
wants
he
wants
to
be
great
and
he
sees
himself
small
he
wants
to
be
happy
and
he
sees
himself
miserable
he
wants
to
be
perfect
and
he
sees
himself
full
of
imperfections
he
wants
to
be
the
object
of
love
and
esteem
among
men
and
he
sees
that
his
faults
merit
only
their
hatred
and
contempt
this
embarrassment
in
which
he
finds
himself
produces
in
him
the
most
unrighteous
and
criminal
passion
that
can
be
imagined
for
he
conceives
a
mortal
enmity
against
that
truth
which
reproves
him
and
which
convinces
him
of
his
faults
he
would
annihilate
it
but
unable
to
destroy
it
in
its
essence
he
destroys
it
as
far
as
possible
in
his
own
knowledge
and
in
that
of
others
that
is
to
say
he
devotes
all
his
attention
to
hiding
his
faults
both
from
others
and
from
himself
and
he
can
not
endure
either
that
others
should
point
them
out
to
him
or
that
they
should
see
them
truly
it
is
an
evil
to
be
full
of
faults
but
it
is
a
still
greater
evil
to
be
full
of
them
and
to
be
unwilling
to
recognise
them
since
that
is
to
add
the
further
fault
of
a
voluntary
illusion
we
do
not
like
others
to
deceive
us
we
do
not
think
it
fair
that
they
should
be
held
in
higher
esteem
by
us
than
they
deserve
it
is
not
then
fair
that
we
should
deceive
them
and
should
wish
them
to
esteem
us
more
highly
than
we
deserve
thus
when
they
discover
only
the
imperfections
and
vices
which
we
really
have
it
is
plain
they
do
us
no
wrong
since
it
is
not
they
who
cause
them
they
rather
do
us
good
since
they
help
us
to
free
ourselves
from
an
evil
namely
the
ignorance
of
these
imperfections
we
ought
not
to
be
angry
at
their
knowing
our
faults
and
despising
us
it
is
but
right
that
they
should
know
us
for
what
we
are
and
should
despise
us
if
we
are
contemptible
such
are
the
feelings
that
would
arise
in
a
heart
full
of
equity
and
justice
what
must
we
say
then
of
our
own
heart
when
we
see
in
it
a
wholly
different
disposition
for
is
it
not
true
that
we
hate
truth
and
those
who
tell
it
us
and
that
we
like
them
to
be
deceived
in
our
favour
and
prefer
to
be
esteemed
by
them
as
being
other
than
what
we
are
in
fact
one
proof
of
this
makes
me
shudder
the
catholic
religion
does
not
bind
us
to
confess
our
sins
indiscriminately
to
everybody
it
allows
them
to
remain
hidden
from
all
other
men
save
one
to
whom
she
bids
us
reveal
the
innermost
recesses
of
our
heart
and
show
ourselves
as
we
are
there
is
only
this
one
man
in
the
world
whom
she
orders
us
to
undeceive
and
she
binds
him
to
an
inviolable
secrecy
which
makes
this
knowledge
to
him
as
if
it
were
not
can
we
imagine
anything
more
charitable
and
pleasant
and
yet
the
corruption
of
man
is
such
that
he
finds
even
this
law
harsh
and
it
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
which
has
caused
a
great
part
of
europe
to
rebel
against
the
church
how
unjust
and
unreasonable
is
the
heart
of
man
which
feels
it
disagreeable
to
be
obliged
to
do
in
regard
to
one
man
what
in
some
measure
it
were
right
to
do
to
all
men
for
is
it
right
that
we
should
deceive
men
there
are
different
degrees
in
this
aversion
to
truth
but
all
may
perhaps
be
said
to
have
it
in
some
degree
because
it
is
inseparable
from
it
is
this
false
delicacy
which
makes
those
who
are
under
the
necessity
of
reproving
others
choose
so
many
windings
and
middle
courses
to
avoid
offence
they
must
lessen
our
faults
appear
to
excuse
them
intersperse
praises
and
evidence
of
love
and
esteem
despite
all
this
the
medicine
does
not
cease
to
be
bitter
to
it
takes
as
little
as
it
can
always
with
disgust
and
often
with
a
secret
spite
against
those
who
administer
it
hence
it
happens
that
if
any
have
some
interest
in
being
loved
by
us
they
are
averse
to
render
us
a
service
which
they
know
to
be
disagreeable
they
treat
us
as
we
wish
to
be
treated
we
hate
the
truth
and
they
hide
it
from
us
we
desire
flattery
and
they
flatter
us
we
like
to
be
deceived
and
they
deceive
us
so
each
degree
of
good
fortune
which
raises
us
in
the
world
removes
us
farther
from
truth
because
we
are
most
afraid
of
wounding
those
whose
affection
is
most
useful
and
whose
dislike
is
most
dangerous
a
prince
may
be
the
byword
of
all
europe
and
he
alone
will
know
nothing
of
it
i
am
not
astonished
to
tell
the
truth
is
useful
to
those
to
whom
it
is
spoken
but
disadvantageous
to
those
who
tell
it
because
it
makes
them
disliked
now
those
who
live
with
princes
love
their
own
interests
more
than
that
of
the
prince
whom
they
serve
and
so
they
take
care
not
to
confer
on
him
a
benefit
so
as
to
injure
themselves
this
evil
is
no
doubt
greater
and
more
common
among
the
higher
classes
but
the
lower
are
not
exempt
from
it
since
there
is
always
some
advantage
in
making
men
love
us
human
life
is
thus
only
a
perpetual
illusion
men
deceive
and
flatter
each
other
no
one
speaks
of
us
in
our
presence
as
he
does
of
us
in
our
absence
human
society
is
founded
on
mutual
deceit
few
friendships
would
endure
if
each
knew
what
his
friend
said
of
him
in
his
absence
although
he
then
spoke
in
sincerity
and
without
passion
man
is
then
only
disguise
falsehood
and
hypocrisy
both
in
himself
and
in
regard
to
others
he
does
not
wish
any
one
to
tell
him
the
truth
he
avoids
telling
it
to
others
and
all
these
dispositions
so
removed
from
justice
and
reason
have
a
natural
root
in
his
heart
i
set
it
down
as
a
fact
that
if
all
men
knew
what
each
said
of
the
other
there
would
not
be
four
friends
in
the
world
this
is
apparent
from
the
quarrels
which
arise
from
the
indiscreet
tales
told
from
time
to
time
i
say
further
all
men
would
be
some
vices
only
lay
hold
of
us
by
means
of
others
and
these
like
branches
fall
on
removal
of
the
trunk
the
example
of
alexander
chastity
has
not
made
so
many
continent
as
that
of
his
drunkenness
has
made
intemperate
it
is
not
shameful
not
to
be
as
virtuous
as
he
and
it
seems
excusable
to
be
no
more
vicious
we
do
not
believe
ourselves
to
be
exactly
sharing
in
the
vices
of
the
vulgar
when
we
see
that
we
are
sharing
in
those
of
great
men
and
yet
we
do
not
observe
that
in
these
matters
they
are
ordinary
men
we
hold
on
to
them
by
the
same
end
by
which
they
hold
on
to
the
rabble
for
however
exalted
they
are
they
are
still
united
at
some
point
to
the
lowest
of
men
they
are
not
suspended
in
the
air
quite
removed
from
our
society
no
no
if
they
are
greater
than
we
it
is
because
their
heads
are
higher
but
their
feet
are
as
low
as
ours
they
are
all
on
the
same
level
and
rest
on
the
same
earth
and
by
that
extremity
they
are
as
low
as
we
are
as
the
meanest
folk
as
infants
and
as
the
beasts
when
our
passion
leads
us
to
do
something
we
forget
our
duty
for
example
we
like
a
book
and
read
it
when
we
ought
to
be
doing
something
else
now
to
remind
ourselves
of
our
duty
we
must
set
ourselves
a
task
we
dislike
we
then
plead
that
we
have
something
else
to
do
and
by
this
means
remember
our
duty
how
difficult
it
is
to
submit
anything
to
the
judgment
of
another
without
prejudicing
his
judgment
by
the
manner
in
which
we
submit
it
if
we
say
i
think
it
beautiful
i
think
it
obscure
or
the
like
we
either
entice
the
imagination
into
that
view
or
irritate
it
to
the
contrary
it
is
better
to
say
nothing
and
then
the
other
judges
according
to
what
really
is
that
is
to
say
according
as
it
then
is
and
according
as
the
other
circumstances
not
of
our
making
have
placed
it
but
we
at
least
shall
have
added
nothing
unless
it
be
that
silence
also
produces
an
effect
according
to
the
turn
and
the
interpretation
which
the
other
will
be
disposed
to
give
it
or
as
he
will
guess
it
from
gestures
or
countenance
or
from
the
tone
of
the
voice
if
he
is
a
physiognomist
so
difficult
is
it
not
to
upset
a
judgment
from
its
natural
place
or
rather
so
rarely
is
it
firm
and
stable
by
knowing
each
man
ruling
passion
we
are
sure
of
pleasing
him
and
yet
each
has
his
fancies
opposed
to
his
true
good
in
the
very
idea
which
he
has
of
the
good
it
is
a
singularly
puzzling
fact
lampade
the
weather
and
my
mood
have
little
connection
i
have
my
foggy
and
my
fine
days
within
me
my
prosperity
or
misfortune
has
little
to
do
with
the
matter
i
sometimes
struggle
against
luck
the
glory
of
mastering
it
makes
me
master
it
gaily
whereas
i
am
sometimes
surfeited
in
the
midst
of
good
fortune
although
people
may
have
no
interest
in
what
they
are
saying
we
must
not
absolutely
conclude
from
this
that
they
are
not
lying
for
there
are
some
people
who
lie
for
the
mere
sake
of
lying
when
we
are
well
we
wonder
what
we
would
do
if
we
were
ill
but
when
we
are
ill
we
take
medicine
cheerfully
the
illness
persuades
us
to
do
so
we
have
no
longer
the
passions
and
desires
for
amusements
and
promenades
which
health
gave
to
us
but
which
are
incompatible
with
the
necessities
of
illness
nature
gives
us
then
passions
and
desires
suitable
to
our
present
state
we
are
only
troubled
by
the
fears
which
we
and
not
nature
give
ourselves
for
they
add
to
the
state
in
which
we
are
the
passions
of
the
state
in
which
we
are
not
as
nature
makes
us
always
unhappy
in
every
state
our
desires
picture
to
us
a
happy
state
because
they
add
to
the
state
in
which
we
are
the
pleasures
of
the
state
in
which
we
are
not
and
if
we
attained
to
these
pleasures
we
should
not
be
happy
after
all
because
we
should
have
other
desires
natural
to
this
new
state
we
must
particularise
this
general
proposition
the
consciousness
of
the
falsity
of
present
pleasures
and
the
ignorance
of
the
vanity
of
absent
pleasures
cause
inconstancy
we
think
we
are
playing
on
ordinary
organs
when
playing
upon
man
men
are
organs
it
is
true
but
odd
changeable
variable
with
pipes
not
arranged
in
proper
order
those
who
only
know
how
to
play
on
ordinary
organs
will
not
produce
harmonies
on
these
we
must
know
where
are
things
have
different
qualities
and
the
soul
different
inclinations
for
nothing
is
simple
which
is
presented
to
the
soul
and
the
soul
never
presents
itself
simply
to
any
object
hence
it
comes
that
we
weep
and
laugh
at
the
same
thing
and
to
live
only
by
work
and
to
rule
over
the
most
powerful
state
in
the
world
are
very
opposite
things
they
are
united
in
the
person
of
the
great
sultan
of
the

as
abundant
as
all
tones
of
the
voice

ways
of
walking
coughing
blowing

nose
sneezing
we
distinguish
vines
by
their
fruit
and
call
them
the
condrien
the
desargues
and
such
and
such
a
stock
is
this
all
has
a
vine
ever
produced
two
bunches
exactly
the
same
and
has
a
bunch
two
grapes
alike
etc
i
can
never
judge
of
the
same
thing
exactly
in
the
same
way
i
can
not
judge
of
my
work
while
doing
it
i
must
do
as
the
artists
stand
at
a
distance
but
not
too
far
how
far
then
guess
theology
is
a
science
but
at
the
same
time
how
many
sciences
a
man
is
a
whole
but
if
we
dissect
him
will
he
be
the
head
the
heart
the
stomach
the
veins
each
vein
each
portion
of
a
vein
the
blood
each
humour
in
the

a

from
afar
a
town
and
a
but
as
we
draw
near
there
are
houses
trees
tiles
leaves
grass
ants
limbs
of
ants
in
infinity
all
this
is
contained
under
the
name
of
all
is
one
all
is
different
how
many
natures
exist
in
man
how
many
vocations
and
by
what
chance
does
each
man
ordinarily
choose

he
has
heard
praised

heel

a
ah
how
well
this

turned

a
clever
workman
how
brave
is
this
soldier
this
is
the
source
of
our
inclinations
and
of
the
choice
of
conditions
how
much
this
man
drinks
how
little
that
one
this
makes
people
sober
or
drunk
soldiers
cowards
etc
chief
talent
that
which
rules
the
rest
nature
imitates
herself
a
seed
sown
in
good
ground
brings
forth

a
principle
instilled
into
a
good
mind
brings
forth

numbers
imitate
space
which
is
of
a
different
nature
all
is
made
and
led
by
the
same
master
root
branches
and
fruits
principles
and
consequences
nature
diversifies
and
imitates
art
imitates
and
diversifies
nature
always
begins
the
same
things
again
the
years
the
days
the
hours
in
like
manner
spaces
and
numbers
follow
each
other
from
beginning
to
end
thus
is
made
a
kind
of
infinity
and
eternity
not
that
anything
in
all
this
is
infinite
and
eternal
but
these
finite
realities
are
infinitely
multiplied
thus
it
seems
to
me
to
be
only
the
number
which
multiplies
them
that
is
infinite
time
heals
griefs
and
quarrels
for
we
change
and
are
no
longer
the
same
persons
neither
the
offender
nor
the
offended
are
any
more
themselves
it
is
like
a
nation
which
we
have
provoked
but
meet
again
after
two
generations
they
are
still
frenchmen
but
not
the
same
he
no
longer
loves
the
person
whom
he
loved
ten
years
ago
i
quite
believe
it
she
is
no
longer
the
same
nor
is
he
he
was
young
and
she
also
she
is
quite
different
he
would
perhaps
love
her
yet
if
she
were
what
she
was
then
we
view
things
not
only
from
different
sides
but
with
different
eyes
we
have
no
wish
to
find
them
alike

weariness

the
weariness

is

by
us
in

a
man

at

with
pleasure
but
if
he
sees
a
woman
who
charms
him
or
if
he
enjoys
himself
in
play
for
five
or
six
days
he
is
miserable
if
he
returns
to
his
former
way
of
living
nothing
is
more
common
than
that

complete

is
death
if
a
soldier
or

complain
of
the

of
his

set

to

nothing
nothing
is
so
insufferable
to
man
as
to
be
completely
at

without

without

he
then
feels

methinks
cæsar
was
too
old
to
set
about
amusing
himself
with
conquering

such
sport
was
good
for
augustus

alexander
they
were
still
young

and
thus
difficult
to
restrain

cæsar
should
have
been
more
mature
two
faces
which
resemble
each
other
make
us
laugh
when
together
by
their
resemblance
though
neither
of
them
by
itself
makes
us
laugh
how
useless
is
painting
which
attracts
admiration
by
the
resemblance
of
things
the
originals
of
which
we
do
not
admire
the
struggle
alone
pleases
us
not
the
victory
we
love
to
see
animals
fighting
not
the
victor
infuriated
over
the
vanquished
we
would
only
see
the
victorious
end
and
as
soon
as
it
comes
we
are
satiated
it
is
the
same
in
play
and
the
same
in
the
search
for
truth
in
disputes
we
like
to
see
the
clash
of
opinions
but
not
at
all
to
contemplate
truth
when
found
to
observe
it
with
pleasure
we
have
to
see
it
emerge
out
of
strife
so
in
the
passions
there
is
pleasure
in
seeing
the
collision
of
two
contraries
but
when
one
acquires
the
mastery
it
becomes
only
brutality
we
never
seek
things
for
themselves
but
for
the
search
likewise
in
plays
scenes
which
do
not
rouse
the
emotion
of
fear
are
worthless
so
are
extreme
and
hopeless
misery
brutal
lust
and
extreme
cruelty
a
mere
trifle
consoles
us
for
a
mere
trifle
distresses
us
without
examining
every
particular
pursuit
it
is
enough
to
comprehend
them
under
diversion
men
naturally
slaters
and
of
all
callings
save
in
their
own
rooms
when
i
have
occasionally
set
myself
to
consider
the
different
distractions
of
men
the
pains
and
perils
to
which
they
expose
themselves
at
court
or
in
war
whence
arise
so
many
quarrels
passions
bold
and
often
bad
ventures
i
have
discovered
that
all
the
unhappiness
of
men
arises
from
one
single
fact
that
they
can
not
stay
quietly
in
their
own
chamber
a
man
who
has
enough
to
live
on
if
he
knew
how
to
stay
with
pleasure
at
home
would
not
leave
it
to
go
to
sea
or
to
besiege
a
town
a
commission
in
the
army
would
not
be
bought
so
dearly
but
that
it
is
found
insufferable
not
to
budge
from
the
town
and
men
only
seek
conversation
and
entering
games
because
they
can
not
remain
with
pleasure
at
home
but
on
further
consideration
when
after
finding
the
cause
of
all
our
ills
i
have
sought
to
discover
the
reason
of
it
i
have
found
that
there
is
one
very
real
reason
namely
the
natural
poverty
of
our
feeble
and
mortal
condition
so
miserable
that
nothing
can
comfort
us
when
we
think
of
it
closely
whatever
condition
we
picture
to
ourselves
if
we
muster
all
the
good
things
which
it
is
possible
to
possess
royalty
is
the
finest
position
in
the
world
yet
when
we
imagine
a
king
attended
with
every
pleasure
he
can
feel
if
he
be
without
diversion
and
be
left
to
consider
and
reflect
on
what
he
is
this
feeble
happiness
will
not
sustain
him
he
will
necessarily
fall
into
forebodings
of
dangers
of
revolutions
which
may
happen
and
finally
of
death
and
inevitable
disease
so
that
if
he
be
without
what
is
called
diversion
he
is
unhappy
and
more
unhappy
than
the
least
of
his
subjects
who
plays
and
diverts
himself
hence
it
comes
that
play
and
the
society
of
women
war
and
high
posts
are
so
sought
after
not
that
there
is
in
fact
any
happiness
in
them
or
that
men
imagine
true
bliss
to
consist
in
money
won
at
play
or
in
the
hare
which
they
hunt
we
would
not
take
these
as
a
gift
we
do
not
seek
that
easy
and
peaceful
lot
which
permits
us
to
think
of
our
unhappy
condition
nor
the
dangers
of
war
nor
the
labour
of
office
but
the
bustle
which
averts
these
thoughts
of
ours
and
amuses
us
reasons
why
we
like
the
chase
better
than
the
quarry
hence
it
comes
that
men
so
much
love
noise
and
stir
hence
it
comes
that
the
prison
is
so
horrible
a
punishment
hence
it
comes
that
the
pleasure
of
solitude
is
a
thing
incomprehensible
and
it
is
in
fact
the
greatest
source
of
happiness
in
the
condition
of
kings
that
men
try
incessantly
to
divert
them
and
to
procure
for
them
all
kinds
of
pleasures
the
king
is
surrounded
by
persons
whose
only
thought
is
to
divert
the
king
and
to
prevent
his
thinking
of
self
for
he
is
unhappy
king
though
he
be
if
he
think
of
himself
this
is
all
that
men
have
been
able
to
discover
to
make
themselves
happy
and
those
who
philosophise
on
the
matter
and
who
think
men
unreasonable
for
spending
a
whole
day
in
chasing
a
hare
which
they
would
not
have
bought
scarce
know
our
nature
the
hare
in
itself
would
not
screen
us
from
the
sight
of
death
and
calamities
but
the
chase
which
turns
away
our
attention
from
these
does
screen
us
the
advice
given
to
pyrrhus
to
take
the
rest
which
he
was
about
to
seek
with
so
much
labour
was
full
of
difficulties
to
bid
a
man
live
quietly
is
to
bid
him
live
happily
it
is
to
advise
him
to
be
in
a
state
perfectly
happy
in
which
he
can
think
at
leisure
without
finding
therein
a
cause
of
distress
this
is
to
misunderstand
nature
as
men
who
naturally
understand
their
own
condition
avoid
nothing
so
much
as
rest
so
there
is
nothing
they
leave
undone
in
seeking
turmoil
not
that
they
have
an
instinctive
knowledge
of
true
happiness
so
we
are
wrong
in
blaming
them
their
error
does
not
lie
in
seeking
excitement
if
they
seek
it
only
as
a
diversion
the
evil
is
that
they
seek
it
as
if
the
possession
of
the
objects
of
their
quest
would
make
them
really
happy
in
this
respect
it
is
right
to
call
their
quest
a
vain
one
hence
in
all
this
both
the
censurers
and
the
censured
do
not
understand
man
true
nature
and
thus
when
we
take
the
exception
against
them
that
what
they
seek
with
such
fervour
can
not
satisfy
them
if
they
replied
as
they
should
do
if
they
considered
the
matter
thoroughly
that
they
sought
in
it
only
a
violent
and
impetuous
occupation
which
turned
their
thoughts
from
self
and
that
they
therefore
chose
an
attractive
object
to
charm
and
ardently
attract
them
they
would
leave
their
opponents
without
a
reply
but
they
do
not
make
this
reply
because
they
do
not
know
themselves
they
do
not
know
that
it
is
the
chase
and
not
the
quarry
which
they
seek
dancing
we
must
consider
rightly
where
to
place
our
a
gentleman
sincerely
believes
that
hunting
is
great
and
royal
sport
but
a
beater
is
not
of
this
opinion
they
imagine
that
if
they
obtained
such
a
post
they
would
then
rest
with
pleasure
and
are
insensible
of
the
insatiable
nature
of
their
desire
they
think
they
are
truly
seeking
quiet
and
they
are
only
seeking
excitement
they
have
a
secret
instinct
which
impels
them
to
seek
amusement
and
occupation
abroad
and
which
arises
from
the
sense
of
their
constant
unhappiness
they
have
another
secret
instinct
a
remnant
of
the
greatness
of
our
original
nature
which
teaches
them
that
happiness
in
reality
consists
only
in
rest
and
not
in
stir
and
of
these
two
contrary
instincts
they
form
within
themselves
a
confused
idea
which
hides
itself
from
their
view
in
the
depths
of
their
soul
inciting
them
to
aim
at
rest
through
excitement
and
always
to
fancy
that
the
satisfaction
which
they
have
not
will
come
to
them
if
by
surmounting
whatever
difficulties
confront
them
they
can
thereby
open
the
door
to
rest
thus
passes
away
all
man
life
men
seek
rest
in
a
struggle
against
difficulties
and
when
they
have
conquered
these
rest
becomes
insufferable
for
we
think
either
of
the
misfortunes
we
have
or
of
those
which
threaten
us
and
even
if
we
should
see
ourselves
sufficiently
sheltered
on
all
sides
weariness
of
its
own
accord
would
not
fail
to
arise
from
the
depths
of
the
heart
wherein
it
has
its
natural
roots
and
to
fill
the
mind
with
its
poison
thus
so
wretched
is
man
that
he
would
weary
even
without
any
cause
for
weariness
from
the
peculiar
state
of
his
disposition
and
so
frivolous
is
he
that
though
full
of
a
thousand
reasons
for
weariness
the
least
thing
such
as
playing
billiards
or
hitting
a
ball
is
sufficient
to
amuse
him
but
will
you
say
what
object
has
he
in
all
this
the
pleasure
of
bragging
among
his
friends
that
he
has
played
better
than
another
so
others
sweat
in
their
own
rooms
to
show
to
the
learned
that
they
have
solved
a
problem
in
algebra
which
no
one
had
hitherto
been
able
to
solve
many
more
expose
themselves
to
extreme
perils
in
my
opinion
as
foolishly
in
order
to
boast
afterwards
that
they
have
captured
a
town
lastly
others
wear
themselves
out
in
studying
all
these
things
not
in
order
to
become
wiser
but
only
in
order
to
prove
that
they
know
them
and
these
are
the
most
senseless
of
the
band
since
they
are
so
knowingly
whereas
one
may
suppose
of
the
others
that
if
they
knew
it
they
would
no
longer
be
foolish
this
man
spends
his
life
without
weariness
in
playing
every
day
for
a
small
stake
give
him
each
morning
the
money
he
can
win
each
day
on
condition
he
does
not
play
you
make
him
miserable
it
will
perhaps
be
said
that
he
seeks
the
amusement
of
play
and
not
the
winnings
make
him
then
play
for
nothing
he
will
not
become
excited
over
it
and
will
feel
bored
it
is
then
not
the
amusement
alone
that
he
seeks
a
languid
and
passionless
amusement
will
weary
him
he
must
get
excited
over
it
and
deceive
himself
by
the
fancy
that
he
will
be
happy
to
win
what
he
would
not
have
as
a
gift
on
condition
of
not
playing
and
he
must
make
for
himself
an
object
of
passion
and
excite
over
it
his
desire
his
anger
his
fear
to
obtain
his
imagined
end
as
children
are
frightened
at
the
face
they
have
blackened
whence
comes
it
that
this
man
who
lost
his
only
son
a
few
months
ago
or
who
this
morning
was
in
such
trouble
through
being
distressed
by
lawsuits
and
quarrels
now
no
longer
thinks
of
them
do
not
wonder
he
is
quite
taken
up
in
looking
out
for
the
boar
which
his
dogs
have
been
hunting
so
hotly
for
the
last
six
hours
he
requires
nothing
more
however
full
of
sadness
a
man
may
be
he
is
happy
for
the
time
if
you
can
prevail
upon
him
to
enter
into
some
amusement
and
however
happy
a
man
may
be
he
will
soon
be
discontented
and
wretched
if
he
be
not
diverted
and
occupied
by
some
passion
or
pursuit
which
prevents
weariness
from
overcoming
him
without
amusement
there
is
no
joy
with
amusement
there
is
no
sadness
and
this
also
constitutes
the
happiness
of
persons
in
high
position
that
they
have
a
number
of
people
to
amuse
them
and
have
the
power
to
keep
themselves
in
this
state
consider
this
what
is
it
to
be
superintendent
chancellor
first
president
but
to
be
in
a
condition
wherein
from
early
morning
a
large
number
of
people
come
from
all
quarters
to
see
them
so
as
not
to
leave
them
an
hour
in
the
day
in
which
they
can
think
of
themselves
and
when
they
are
in
disgrace
and
sent
back
to
their
country
houses
where
they
lack
neither
wealth
nor
servants
to
help
them
on
occasion
they
do
not
fail
to
be
wretched
and
desolate
because
no
one
prevents
them
from
thinking
of
themselves
how
does
it
happen
that
this
man
so
distressed
at
the
death
of
his
wife
and
his
only
son
or
who
has
some
great
lawsuit
which
annoys
him
is
not
at
this
moment
sad
and
that
he
seems
so
free
from
all
painful
and
disquieting
thoughts
we
need
not
wonder
for
a
ball
has
been
served
him
and
he
must
return
it
to
his
companion
he
is
occupied
in
catching
it
in
its
fall
from
the
roof
to
win
a
game
how
can
he
think
of
his
own
affairs
pray
when
he
has
this
other
matter
in
hand
here
is
a
care
worthy
of
occupying
this
great
soul
and
taking
away
from
him
every
other
thought
of
the
mind
this
man
born
to
know
the
universe
to
judge
all
causes
to
govern
a
whole
state
is
altogether
occupied
and
taken
up
with
the
business
of
catching
a
hare
and
if
he
does
not
lower
himself
to
this
and
wants
always
to
be
on
the
strain
he
will
be
more
foolish
still
because
he
would
raise
himself
above
humanity
and
after
all
he
is
only
a
man
that
is
to
say
capable
of
little
and
of
much
of
all
and
of
nothing
he
is
neither
angel
nor
brute
but
man
men
spend
their
time
in
following
a
ball
or
a
hare
it
is
the
pleasure
even
of
kings
is
not
the
royal
dignity
sufficiently
great
in
itself
to
make
its
possessor
happy
by
the
mere
contemplation
of
what
he
is
must
he
be
diverted
from
this
thought
like
ordinary
folk
i
see
well
that
a
man
is
made
happy
by
diverting
him
from
the
view
of
his
domestic
sorrows
so
as
to
occupy
all
his
thoughts
with
the
care
of
dancing
well
but
will
it
be
the
same
with
a
king
and
will
he
be
happier
in
the
pursuit
of
these
idle
amusements
than
in
the
contemplation
of
his
greatness
and
what
more
satisfactory
object
could
be
presented
to
his
mind
would
it
not
be
a
deprivation
of
his
delight
for
him
to
occupy
his
soul
with
the
thought
of
how
to
adjust
his
steps
to
the
cadence
of
an
air
or
of
how
to
throw
a
ball
skilfully
instead
of
leaving
it
to
enjoy
quietly
the
contemplation
of
the
majestic
glory
which
encompasses
him
let
us
make
the
trial
let
us
leave
a
king
all
alone
to
reflect
on
himself
quite
at
leisure
without
any
gratification
of
the
senses
without
any
care
in
his
mind
without
society
and
we
will
see
that
a
king
without
diversion
is
a
man
full
of
wretchedness
so
this
is
carefully
avoided
and
near
the
persons
of
kings
there
never
fail
to
be
a
great
number
of
people
who
see
to
it
that
amusement
follows
business
and
who
watch
all
the
time
of
their
leisure
to
supply
them
with
delights
and
games
so
that
there
is
no
blank
in
it
in
fact
kings
are
surrounded
with
persons
who
are
wonderfully
attentive
in
taking
care
that
the
king
be
not
alone
and
in
a
state
to
think
of
himself
knowing
well
that
he
will
be
miserable
king
though
he
be
if
he
meditate
on
self
in
all
this
i
am
not
talking
of
christian
kings
as
christians
but
only
as
kings
men
are
entrusted
from
infancy
with
the
care
of
their
honour
their
property
their
friends
and
even
with
the
property
and
the
honour
of
their
friends
they
are
overwhelmed
with
business
with
the
study
of
languages
and
with
physical
exercise
and
they
are
made
to
understand
that
they
can
not
be
happy
unless
their
health
their
honour
their
fortune
and
that
of
their
friends
be
in
good
condition
and
that
a
single
thing
wanting
will
make
them
unhappy
thus
they
are
given
cares
and
business
which
make
them
bustle
about
from
break
of
it
is
you
will
exclaim
a
strange
way
to
make
them
happy
what
more
could
be
done
to
make
them
miserable
indeed
what
could
be
done
we
should
only
have
to
relieve
them
from
all
these
cares
for
then
they
would
see
themselves
they
would
reflect
on
what
they
are
whence
they
came
whither
they
go
and
thus
we
can
not
employ
and
divert
them
too
much
and
this
is
why
after
having
given
them
so
much
business
we
advise
them
if
they
have
some
time
for
relaxation
to
employ
it
in
amusement
in
play
and
to
be
always
fully
occupied
how
hollow
and
full
of
ribaldry
is
the
heart
of
man
i
spent
a
long
time
in
the
study
of
the
abstract
sciences
and
was
disheartened
by
the
small
number
of
in
them
when
i
commenced
the
study
of
man
i
saw
that
these
abstract
sciences
are
not
suited
to
man
and
that
i
was
wandering
farther
from
my
own
state
in
examining
them
than
others
in
not
knowing
them
i
pardoned
their
little
knowledge
but
i
thought
at
least
to
find
many
companions
in
the
study
of
man
and
that
it
was
the
true
study
which
is
suited
to
him
i
have
been
deceived
still
fewer
study
it
than
geometry
it
is
only
from
the
want
of
knowing
how
to
study
this
that
we
seek
the
other
studies
but
is
it
not
that
even
here
is
not
the
knowledge
which
man
should
have
and
that
for
the
purpose
of
happiness
it
is
better
for
him
not
to
know
himself
one
thought
alone
occupies
us
we
can
not
think
of
two
things
at
the
same
time
this
is
lucky
for
us
according
to
the
world
not
according
to
god
man
is
obviously
made
to
think
it
is
his
whole
dignity
and
his
whole
merit
and
his
whole
duty
is
to
think
as
he
ought
now
the
order
of
thought
is
to
begin
with
self
and
with
its
author
and
its
end
now
of
what
does
the
world
think
never
of
this
but
of
dancing
playing
the
lute
singing
making
verses
running
at
the
ring
fighting
making
oneself
king
without
thinking
what
it
is
to
be
a
king
and
what
to
be
a
man
we
do
not
content
ourselves
with
the
life
we
have
in
ourselves
and
in
our
own
being
we
desire
to
live
an
imaginary
life
in
the
mind
of
others
and
for
this
purpose
we
endeavour
to
shine
we
labour
unceasingly
to
adorn
and
preserve
this
imaginary
existence
and
neglect
the
real
and
if
we
possess
calmness
or
generosity
or
truthfulness
we
are
eager
to
make
it
known
so
as
to
attach
these
virtues
to
that
imaginary
existence
we
would
rather
separate
them
from
ourselves
to
join
them
to
it
and
we
would
willingly
be
cowards
in
order
to
acquire
the
reputation
of
being
brave
a
great
proof
of
the
nothingness
of
our
being
not
to
be
satisfied
with
the
one
without
the
other
and
to
renounce
the
one
for
the
other
for
he
would
be
infamous
who
would
not
die
to
preserve
his
honour
we
are
so
presumptuous
that
we
would
wish
to
be
known
by
all
the
world
even
by
people
who
shall
come
after
when
we
shall
be
no
more
and
we
are
so
vain
that
the
esteem
of
five
or
six
neighbours
delights
and
contents
us
we
do
not
trouble
ourselves
about
being
esteemed
in
the
towns
through
which
we
pass
but
if
we
are
to
remain
a
little
while
there
we
are
so
concerned
how
long
is
necessary
a
time
commensurate
with
our
vain
and
paltry
life
vanity
is
so
anchored
in
the
heart
of
man
that
a
soldier
a
servant
a
cook
a
porter
brags
and
wishes
to
have
his
admirers
even
philosophers
wish
for
them
those
who
write
against
it
want
to
have
the
glory
of
having
written
well
and
those
who
read
it
desire
the
glory
of
having
read
it
i
who
write
this
have
perhaps
this
desire
and
perhaps
those
who
will
read
it
admiration
spoils
all
from
infancy
ah
how
well
said
ah
how
well
done
how
he
is
etc
the
children
of
who
do
not
receive
this
stimulus
of
envy
and
glory
fall
into
carelessness
curiosity
is
only
vanity
most
frequently
we
wish
to
know
but
to
talk
otherwise
we
would
not
take
a
sea
voyage
in
order
never
to
talk
of
it
and
for
the
sole
pleasure
of
seeing
without
hope
of
ever
communicating
it
the

being

by
those
with
whom

pride
takes
such
natural
possession

in

we
even
lose

provided
people
talk

a

a
true
friend
is
so
great
an
advantage
even
for
the
greatest
lords
in
order
that
he
may
speak
well
of
them
and
back
them
in
their
absence
that
they
should
do
all
to
have
one
but
they
should
choose
well
for
if
they
spend
all
their
efforts
in
the
interests
of
fools
it
will
be
of
no
use
however
well
these
may
speak
of
them
and
these
will
not
even
speak
well
of
them
if
they
find
themselves
on
the
weakest
side
for
they
have
no

thus
they

every

to

the
love
of
which
is
so
strong
and
so
natural
contradiction
contempt
for
our
existence
to
die
for
nothing
hatred
of
our
existence
the
charm
of
fame
is
so
great
that
we
like
every
object
to
which
it
is
attached
even
death
noble
deeds
are
most
estimable
when
hidden
when
i
see
some
of
these
in
history
as
they
please
me
greatly
but
after
all
they
have
not
been
quite
hidden
since
they
have
been
known
and
though
people
have
done
what
they
could
to
hide
them
the
little
publication
of
them
spoils
all
for
what
was
best
in
them
was
the
wish
to
hide
them
sneezing
absorbs
all
the
functions
of
the
soul
as
well
as
work
does
but
we
do
not
draw
therefrom
the
same
conclusions
against
the
greatness
of
man
because
it
is
against
his
will
and
although
we
bring
it
on
ourselves
it
is
nevertheless
against
our
will
that
we
sneeze
it
is
not
in
view
of
the
act
itself
it
is
for
another
end
and
thus
it
is
not
a
proof
of
the
weakness
of
man
and
of
his
slavery
under
that
action
it
is
not
disgraceful
for
man
to
yield
to
pain
and
it
is
disgraceful
to
yield
to
pleasure
this
is
not
because
pain
comes
to
us
from
without
and
we
ourselves
seek
pleasure
for
it
is
possible
to
seek
pain
and
yield
to
it
purposely
without
this
kind
of
baseness
whence
comes
it
then
that
reason
thinks
it
honourable
to
succumb
under
stress
of
pain
and
disgraceful
to
yield
to
the
attack
of
pleasure
it
is
because
pain
does
not
tempt
and
attract
us
it
is
we
ourselves
who
choose
it
voluntarily
and
will
it
to
prevail
over
us
so
that
we
are
masters
of
the
situation
and
in
this
man
yields
to
himself
but
in
pleasure
it
is
man
who
yields
to
pleasure
now
only
mastery
and
sovereignty
bring
glory
and
only
slavery
brings
shame
how
wonderful
it
is
that
a
thing
so
evident
as
the
vanity
of
the
world
is
so
little
known
that
it
is
a
strange
and
surprising
thing
to
say
that
it
is
foolish
to
seek
greatness
he
who
will
know
fully
the
vanity
of
man
has
only
to
consider
the
causes
and
effects
of
love
the
cause
is
a
ne
sais
corneille
and
the
effects
are
dreadful
this
ne
sais
so
small
an
object
that
we
can
not
recognise
it
agitates
a
whole

the
entire

he
who
does
not
see
the
vanity
of
the
world
is
himself
very
vain
indeed
who
do
not
see
it
but
youths
who
are
absorbed
in
fame
diversion
and
the
thought
of
the
future
but
take
away
diversion
and
you
will
see
them
dried
up
with
weariness
they
feel
then
their
nothingness
without
knowing
it
for
it
is
indeed
to
be
unhappy
to
be
in
insufferable
sadness
as
soon
as
we
are
reduced
to
thinking
of
self
and
have
no
diversion
omnibus
requiem
if
our
condition
were
truly
happy
we
would
not
need
diversion
from
thinking
of
it
in
order
to
make
ourselves
happy
death
is
easier
to
bear
without
thinking
of
it
than
is
the
thought
of
death
without
peril
the
miseries
of
human
life
have
established
all
this
as
men
have
seen
this
they
have
taken
up
diversion
as
men
are
not
able
to
fight
against
death
misery
ignorance
they
have
taken
it
into
their
heads
in
order
to
be
happy
not
to
think
of
them
at
all
despite
these
miseries
man
wishes
to
be
happy
and
only
wishes
to
be
happy
and
can
not
wish
not
to
be
so
but
how
will
he
set
about
it
to
be
happy
he
would
have
to
make
himself
immortal
but
not
being
able
to
do
so
it
has
occurred
to
him
to
prevent
himself
from
thinking
of
death
if
man
were
happy
he
would
be
the
more
so
the
less
he
was
diverted
like
the
saints
and
yes
but
is
it
not
to
be
happy
to
have
a
faculty
of
being
amused
by
diversion
no
for
that
comes
from
elsewhere
and
from
without
and
thus
is
dependent
and
therefore
subject
to
be
disturbed
by
a
thousand
accidents
which
bring
inevitable
griefs
the
only
thing
which
consoles
us
for
our
miseries
is
diversion
and
yet
this
it
the
greatest
of
our
miseries
for
it
is
this
which
principally
hinders
us
from
reflecting
upon
ourselves
and
which
makes
us
insensibly
ruin
ourselves
without
this
we
should
be
in
a
state
of
weariness
and
this
weariness
would
spur
us
to
seek
a
more
solid
means
of
escaping
from
it
but
diversion
amuses
us
and
leads
us
unconsciously
to
death
we
do
not
rest
satisfied
with
the
present
we
anticipate
the
future
as
too
slow
in
coming
as
if
in
order
to
hasten
its
course
or
we
recall
the
past
to
stop
its
too
rapid
flight
so
imprudent
are
we
that
we
wander
in
the
times
which
are
not
ours
and
do
not
think
of
the
only
one
which
belongs
to
us
and
so
idle
are
we
that
we
dream
of
those
times
which
are
no
more
and
thoughtlessly
overlook
that
which
alone
exists
for
the
present
is
generally
painful
to
us
we
conceal
it
from
our
sight
because
it
troubles
us
and
if
it
be
delightful
to
us
we
regret
to
see
it
pass
away
we
try
to
sustain
it
by
the
future
and
think
of
arranging
matters
which
are
not
in
our
power
for
a
time
which
we
have
no
certainty
of
reaching
let
each
one
examine
his
thoughts
and
he
will
find
them
all
occupied
with
the
past
and
the
future
we
scarcely
ever
think
of
the
present
and
if
we
think
of
it
it
is
only
to
take
light
from
it
to
arrange
the
future
the
present
is
never
our
end
the
past
and
the
present
are
our
means
the
future
alone
is
our
end
so
we
never
live
but
we
hope
to
live
and
as
we
are
always
preparing
to
be
happy
it
is
inevitable
we
should
never
be
so
they
say
that
eclipses
foretoken
misfortune
because
misfortunes
are
common
so
that
as
evil
happens
so
often
they
often
foretell
it
whereas
if
they
said
that
they
predict
good
fortune
they
would
often
be
wrong
they
attribute
good
fortune
only
to
rare
conjunctions
of
the
heavens
so
they
seldom
fail
in
prediction

of

to

kindly
is
to
put
religion
into

by
reason
and
into
the
heart
by
grace
but
to
will
to
put
it
into
the
mind
and

by
force
and
threats
is
not
to
put
religion
there
but
terror
potius

improba
quasi

ep
or
mendacium
ad
men
despise
religion
they
hate
it
and
fear
it
is
true
to
remedy
this
we
must
begin
by
showing
that
religion
is
not
contrary
to
reason
that
it
is
venerable
to
inspire
respect
for
it
then
we
must
make
it
lovable
to
make
good
men
hope
it
is
true
finally
we
must
prove
it
is
true
venerable
because
it
has
perfect
knowledge
of
man
lovable
because
it
promises
the
true
good
in
every
dialogue
and
discourse
we
must
be
able
to
say
to
those
who
take
offence
of
what
do
you
complain
to
begin
by
pitying
unbelievers
they
are
wretched
enough
by
their
condition
we
ought
only
to
revile
them
where
it
is
beneficial
but
this
does
them
harm
to
pity
atheists
who
seek
for
are
they
not
unhappy
enough
to
inveigh
against
those
who
make
a
boast
of
it
and
will
this
one
scoff
at
the
other
who
ought
to
scoff
and
yet
the
latter
does
not
scoff
at
the
other
but
pities
him
to
reproach
miton
with
not
being
troubled
since
god
will
reproach
him
fiet

qui
minima

let
them
at
least
learn
what
is
the
religion
they
attack
before
attacking
it
if
this
religion
boasted
of
having
a
clear
view
of
god
and
of
possessing
it
open
and
unveiled
it
would
be
attacking
it
to
say
that
we
see
nothing
in
the
world
which
shows
it
with
this
clearness
but
since
on
the
contrary
it
says
that
men
are
in
darkness
and
estranged
from
god
that
he
has
hidden
himself
from
their
knowledge
that
this
is
in
fact
the
name
which
he
gives
himself
in
the
scriptures
and
finally
if
it
endeavours
equally
to
establish
these
two
things
that
god
has
set
up
in
the
church
visible
signs
to
make
himself
known
to
those
who
should
seek
him
sincerely
and
that
he
has
nevertheless
so
disguised
them
that
he
will
only
be
perceived
by
those
who
seek
him
with
all
their
heart
what
advantage
can
they
obtain
when
in
the
negligence
with
which
they
make
profession
of
being
in
search
of
the
truth
they
cry
out
that
nothing
reveals
it
to
them
and
since
that
darkness
in
which
they
are
and
with
which
they
upbraid
the
church
establishes
only
one
of
the
things
which
she
affirms
without
touching
the
other
and
very
far
from
destroying
proves
her
doctrine
in
order
to
attack
it
they
should
have
protested
that
they
had
made
every
effort
to
seek
him
everywhere
and
even
in
that
which
the
church
proposes
for
their
instruction
but
without
satisfaction
if
they
talked
in
this
manner
they
would
in
truth
be
attacking
one
of
her
pretensions
but
i
hope
here
to
show
that
no
reasonable
person
can
speak
thus
and
i
venture
even
to
say
that
no
one
has
ever
done
so
we
know
well
enough
how
those
who
are
of
this
mind
behave
they
believe
they
have
made
great
efforts
for
their
instruction
when
they
have
spent
a
few
hours
in
reading
some
book
of
scripture
and
have
questioned
some
priest
on
the
truths
of
the
faith
after
that
they
boast
of
having
made
vain
search
in
books
and
among
men
but
verily
i
will
tell
them
what
i
have
often
said
that
this
negligence
is
insufferable
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
the
trifling
interests
of
some
stranger
that
we
should
treat
it
in
this
fashion
the
matter
concerns
ourselves
and
our
all
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
a
matter
which
is
of
so
great
consequence
to
us
and
which
touches
us
so
profoundly
that
we
must
have
lost
all
feeling
to
be
indifferent
as
to
knowing
what
it
is
all
our
actions
and
thoughts
must
take
such
different
courses
according
as
there
are
or
are
not
eternal
joys
to
hope
for
that
it
is
impossible
to
take
one
step
with
sense
and
judgment
unless
we
regulate
our
course
by
our
view
of
this
point
which
ought
to
be
our
ultimate
end
thus
our
first
interest
and
our
first
duty
is
to
enlighten
ourselves
on
this
subject
whereon
depends
all
our
conduct
therefore
among
those
who
do
not
believe
i
make
a
vast
difference
between
those
who
strive
with
all
their
power
to
inform
themselves
and
those
who
live
without
troubling
or
thinking
about
it
i
can
have
only
compassion
for
those
who
sincerely
bewail
their
doubt
who
regard
it
as
the
greatest
of
misfortunes
and
who
sparing
no
effort
to
escape
it
make
of
this
inquiry
their
principal
and
most
serious
occupations
but
as
for
those
who
pass
their
life
without
thinking
of
this
ultimate
end
of
life
and
who
for
this
sole
reason
that
they
do
not
find
within
themselves
the
lights
which
convince
them
of
it
neglect
to
seek
them
elsewhere
and
to
examine
thoroughly
whether
this
opinion
is
one
of
those
which
people
receive
with
credulous
simplicity
or
one
of
those
which
although
obscure
in
themselves
have
nevertheless
a
solid
and
immovable
foundation
i
look
upon
them
in
a
manner
quite
different
this
carelessness
in
a
matter
which
concerns
themselves
their
eternity
their
all
moves
me
more
to
anger
than
pity
it
astonishes
and
shocks
me
it
is
to
me
monstrous
i
do
not
say
this
out
of
the
pious
zeal
of
a
spiritual
devotion
i
expect
on
the
contrary
that
we
ought
to
have
this
feeling
from
principles
of
human
interest
and
for
this
we
need
only
see
what
the
least
enlightened
persons
see
we
do
not
require
great
education
of
the
mind
to
understand
that
here
is
no
real
and
lasting
satisfaction
that
our
pleasures
are
only
vanity
that
our
evils
are
infinite
and
lastly
that
death
which
threatens
us
every
moment
must
infallibly
place
us
within
a
few
years
under
the
dreadful
necessity
of
being
for
ever
either
annihilated
or
unhappy
there
is
nothing
more
real
than
this
nothing
more
terrible
be
we
as
heroic
as
we
like
that
is
the
end
which
awaits
the
noblest
life
in
the
world
let
us
reflect
on
this
and
then
say
whether
it
is
not
beyond
doubt
that
there
is
no
good
in
this
life
but
in
the
hope
of
another
that
we
are
happy
only
in
proportion
as
we
draw
near
it
and
that
as
there
are
no
more
woes
for
those
who
have
complete
assurance
of
eternity
so
there
is
no
more
happiness
for
those
who
have
no
insight
into
it
surely
then
it
is
a
great
evil
thus
to
be
in
doubt
but
it
is
at
least
an
indispensable
duty
to
seek
when
we
are
in
such
doubt
and
thus
the
doubter
who
does
not
seek
is
altogether
completely
unhappy
and
completely
wrong
and
if
besides
this
he
is
easy
and
content
professes
to
be
so
and
indeed
boasts
of
it
if
it
is
this
state
itself
which
is
the
subject
of
his
joy
and
vanity
i
have
no
words
to
describe
so
silly
a
creature
how
can
people
hold
these
opinions
what
joy
can
we
find
in
the
expectation
of
nothing
but
hopeless
misery
what
reason
for
boasting
that
we
are
in
impenetrable
darkness
and
how
can
it
happen
that
the
following
argument
occurs
to
a
reasonable
man
i
know
not
who
put
me
into
the
world
nor
what
the
world
is
nor
what
i
myself
am
i
am
in
terrible
ignorance
of
everything
i
know
not
what
my
body
is
nor
my
senses
nor
my
soul
not
even
that
part
of
me
which
thinks
what
i
say
which
reflects
on
all
and
on
itself
and
knows
itself
no
more
than
the
rest
i
see
those
frightful
spaces
of
the
universe
which
surround
me
and
i
find
myself
tied
to
one
corner
of
this
vast
expanse
without
knowing
why
i
am
put
in
this
place
rather
than
in
another
nor
why
the
short
time
which
is
given
me
to
live
is
assigned
to
me
at
this
point
rather
than
at
another
of
the
whole
eternity
which
was
before
me
or
which
shall
come
after
me
i
see
nothing
but
infinites
on
all
sides
which
surround
me
as
an
atom
and
as
a
shadow
which
endures
only
for
an
instant
and
returns
no
more
all
i
know
is
that
i
must
soon
die
but
what
i
know
least
is
this
very
death
which
i
can
not
escape
as
i
know
not
whence
i
come
so
i
know
not
whither
i
go
i
know
only
that
in
leaving
this
world
i
fall
for
ever
either
into
annihilation
or
into
the
hands
of
an
angry
god
without
knowing
to
which
of
these
two
states
i
shall
be
for
ever
assigned
such
is
my
state
full
of
weakness
and
uncertainty
and
from
all
this
i
conclude
that
i
ought
to
spend
all
the
days
of
my
life
without
caring
to
inquire
into
what
must
happen
to
me
perhaps
i
might
find
some
solution
to
my
doubts
but
i
will
not
take
the
trouble
nor
take
a
step
to
seek
it
and
after
treating
with
scorn
those
who
are
concerned
with
this
care
i
will
go
without
foresight
and
without
fear
to
try
the
great
event
and
let
myself
be
led
carelessly
to
death
uncertain
of
the
eternity
of
my
future
state
who
would
desire
to
have
for
a
friend
a
man
who
talks
in
this
fashion
who
would
choose
him
out
from
others
to
tell
him
of
his
affairs
who
would
have
recourse
to
him
in
affliction
and
indeed
to
what
use
in
life
could
one
put
him
in
truth
it
is
the
glory
of
religion
to
have
for
enemies
men
so
unreasonable
and
their
opposition
to
it
is
so
little
dangerous
that
it
serves
on
the
contrary
to
establish
its
truths
for
the
christian
faith
goes
mainly
to
establish
these
two
facts
the
corruption
of
nature
and
redemption
by
jesus
christ
now
i
contend
that
if
these
men
do
not
serve
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
redemption
by
the
holiness
of
their
behaviour
they
at
least
serve
admirably
to
show
the
corruption
of
nature
by
sentiments
so
unnatural
nothing
is
so
important
to
man
as
his
own
state
nothing
is
so
formidable
to
him
as
eternity
and
thus
it
is
not
natural
that
there
should
be
men
indifferent
to
the
loss
of
their
existence
and
to
the
perils
of
everlasting
suffering
they
are
quite
different
with
regard
to
all
other
things
they
are
afraid
of
mere
trifles
they
foresee
them
they
feel
them
and
this
same
man
who
spends
so
many
days
and
nights
in
rage
and
despair
for
the
loss
of
office
or
for
some
imaginary
insult
to
his
honour
is
the
very
one
who
knows
without
anxiety
and
without
emotion
that
he
will
lose
all
by
death
it
is
a
monstrous
thing
to
see
in
the
same
heart
and
at
the
same
time
this
sensibility
to
trifles
and
this
strange
insensibility
to
the
greatest
objects
it
is
an
incomprehensible
enchantment
and
a
supernatural
slumber
which
indicates
as
its
cause
an
force
there
must
be
a
strange
confusion
in
the
nature
of
man
that
he
should
boast
of
being
in
that
state
in
which
it
seems
incredible
that
a
single
individual
should
be
however
experience
has
shown
me
so
great
a
number
of
such
persons
that
the
fact
would
be
surprising
if
we
did
not
know
that
the
greater
part
of
those
who
trouble
themselves
about
the
matter
are
disingenuous
and
not
in
fact
what
they
say
they
are
people
who
have
heard
it
said
that
it
is
the
fashion
to
be
thus
daring
it
is
what
they
call
shaking
off
the
yoke
and
they
try
to
imitate
this
but
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
make
them
understand
how
greatly
they
deceive
themselves
in
thus
seeking
esteem
this
is
not
the
way
to
gain
it
even
i
say
among
those
men
of
the
world
who
take
a
healthy
view
of
things
and
who
know
that
the
only
way
to
succeed
in
this
life
is
to
make
ourselves
appear
honourable
faithful
judicious
and
capable
of
useful
service
to
a
friend
because
naturally
men
love
only
what
may
be
useful
to
them
now
what
do
we
gain
by
hearing
it
said
of
a
man
that
he
has
now
thrown
off
the
yoke
that
he
does
not
believe
there
is
a
god
who
watches
our
actions
that
he
considers
himself
the
sole
master
of
his
conduct
and
that
he
thinks
he
is
accountable
for
it
only
to
himself
does
he
think
that
he
has
thus
brought
us
to
have
henceforth
complete
confidence
in
him
and
to
look
to
him
for
consolation
advice
and
help
in
every
need
of
life
do
they
profess
to
have
delighted
us
by
telling
us
that
they
hold
our
soul
to
be
only
a
little
wind
and
smoke
especially
by
telling
us
this
in
a
haughty
and
tone
of
voice
is
this
a
thing
to
say
gaily
is
it
not
on
the
contrary
a
thing
to
say
sadly
as
the
saddest
thing
in
the
world
if
they
thought
of
it
seriously
they
would
see
that
this
is
so
bad
a
mistake
so
contrary
to
good
sense
so
opposed
to
decency
and
so
removed
in
every
respect
from
that
good
breeding
which
they
seek
that
they
would
be
more
likely
to
correct
than
to
pervert
those
who
had
an
inclination
to
follow
them
and
indeed
make
them
give
an
account
of
their
opinions
and
of
the
reasons
which
they
have
for
doubting
religion
and
they
will
say
to
you
things
so
feeble
and
so
petty
that
they
will
persuade
you
of
the
contrary
the
following
is
what
a
person
one
day
said
to
such
a
one
very
appositely
if
you
continue
to
talk
in
this
manner
you
will
really
make
me
religious
and
he
was
right
for
who
would
not
have
a
horror
of
holding
opinions
in
which
he
would
have
such
contemptible
persons
as
companions
thus
those
who
only
feign
these
opinions
would
be
very
unhappy
if
they
restrained
their
natural
feelings
in
order
to
make
themselves
the
most
conceited
of
men
if
at
the
bottom
of
their
heart
they
are
troubled
at
not
having
more
light
let
them
not
disguise
the
fact
this
avowal
will
not
be
shameful
the
only
shame
is
to
have
none
nothing
reveals
more
an
extreme
weakness
of
mind
than
not
to
know
the
misery
of
a
godless
man
nothing
is
more
indicative
of
a
bad
disposition
of
heart
than
not
to
desire
the
truth
of
eternal
promises
nothing
is
more
dastardly
than
to
act
with
bravado
before
god
let
them
then
leave
these
impieties
to
those
who
are
sufficiently
to
be
really
capable
of
them
let
them
at
least
be
honest
men
if
they
can
not
be
christians
finally
let
them
recognise
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
people
one
can
call
reasonable
those
who
serve
god
with
all
their
heart
because
they
know
him
and
those
who
seek
him
with
all
their
heart
because
they
do
not
know
him
but
as
for
those
who
live
without
knowing
him
and
without
seeking
him
they
judge
themselves
so
little
worthy
of
their
own
care
that
they
are
not
worthy
of
the
care
of
others
and
it
needs
all
the
charity
of
the
religion
which
they
despise
not
to
despise
them
even
to
the
point
of
leaving
them
to
their
folly
but
because
this
religion
obliges
us
always
to
regard
them
so
long
as
they
are
in
this
life
as
capable
of
the
grace
which
can
enlighten
them
and
to
believe
that
they
may
in
a
little
time
be
more
replenished
with
faith
than
we
are
and
that
on
the
other
hand
we
may
fall
into
the
blindness
wherein
they
are
we
must
do
for
them
what
we
would
they
should
do
for
us
if
we
were
in
their
place
and
call
upon
them
to
have
pity
upon
themselves
and
to
take
at
least
some
steps
in
the
endeavour
to
find
light
let
them
give
to
reading
this
some
of
the
hours
which
they
otherwise
employ
so
uselessly
whatever
aversion
they
may
bring
to
the
task
they
will
perhaps
gain
something
and
at
least
will
not
lose
much
but
as
for
those
who
bring
to
the
task
perfect
sincerity
and
a
real
desire
to
meet
with
truth
those
i
hope
will
be
satisfied
and
convinced
of
the
proofs
of
a
religion
so
divine
which
i
have
here
collected
and
in
which
i
have
followed
somewhat
after
this
order
before
entering
into
the
proofs
of
the
christian
religion
i
find
it
necessary
to
point
out
the
sinfulness
of
those
men
who
live
in
indifference
to
the
search
for
truth
in
a
matter
which
is
so
important
to
them
and
which
touches
them
so
nearly
of
all
their
errors
this
doubtless
is
the
one
which
most
convicts
them
of
foolishness
and
blindness
and
in
which
it
is
easiest
to
confound
them
by
the
first
glimmerings
of
common
sense
and
by
natural
feelings
for
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
the
duration
of
this
life
is
but
a
moment
that
the
state
of
death
is
eternal
whatever
may
be
its
nature
and
that
thus
all
our
actions
and
thoughts
must
take
such
different
directions
according
to
the
state
of
that
eternity
that
it
is
impossible
to
take
one
step
with
sense
and
judgment
unless
we
regulate
our
course
by
the
truth
of
that
point
which
ought
to
be
our
ultimate
end
there
is
nothing
clearer
than
this
and
thus
according
to
the
principles
of
reason
the
conduct
of
men
is
wholly
unreasonable
if
they
do
not
take
another
course
on
this
point
therefore
we
condemn
those
who
live
without
thought
of
the
ultimate
end
of
life
who
let
themselves
be
guided
by
their
own
inclinations
and
their
own
pleasures
without
reflection
and
without
concern
and
as
if
they
could
annihilate
eternity
by
turning
away
their
thought
from
it
think
only
of
making
themselves
happy
for
the
moment
yet
this
eternity
exists
and
death
which
must
open
into
it
and
threatens
them
every
hour
must
in
a
little
time
infallibly
put
them
under
the
dreadful
necessity
of
being
either
annihilated
or
unhappy
for
ever
without
knowing
which
of
these
eternities
is
for
ever
prepared
for
them
this
is
a
doubt
of
terrible
consequence
they
are
in
peril
of
eternal
woe
and
thereupon
as
if
the
matter
were
not
worth
the
trouble
they
neglect
to
inquire
whether
this
is
one
of
those
opinions
which
people
receive
with
too
credulous
a
facility
or
one
of
those
which
obscure
in
themselves
have
a
very
firm
though
hidden
foundation
thus
they
know
not
whether
there
be
truth
or
falsity
in
the
matter
nor
whether
there
be
strength
or
weakness
in
the
proofs
they
have
them
before
their
eyes
they
refuse
to
look
at
them
and
in
that
ignorance
they
choose
all
that
is
necessary
to
fall
into
this
misfortune
if
it
exists
to
await
death
to
make
trial
of
it
yet
to
be
very
content
in
this
state
to
make
profession
of
it
and
indeed
to
boast
of
it
can
we
think
seriously
on
the
importance
of
this
subject
without
being
horrified
at
conduct
so
extravagant
this
resting
in
ignorance
is
a
monstrous
thing
and
they
who
pass
their
life
in
it
must
be
made
to
feel
its
extravagance
and
stupidity
by
having
it
shown
to
them
so
that
they
may
be
confounded
by
the
sight
of
their
folly
for
this
is
how
men
reason
when
they
choose
to
live
in
such
ignorance
of
what
they
are
and
without
seeking
enlightenment
i
know
not
they
say
men
lack
heart
they
would
not
make
a
friend
of
it
to
be
insensible
to
the
extent
of
despising
interesting
things
and
to
become
insensible
to
the
point
which
interests
us
most
the
sensibility
of
man
to
trifles
and
his
insensibility
to
great
things
indicates
a
strange
inversion
let
us
imagine
a
number
of
men
in
chains
and
all
condemned
to
death
where
some
are
killed
each
day
in
the
sight
of
the
others
and
those
who
remain
see
their
own
fate
in
that
of
their
fellows
and
wait
their
turn
looking
at
each
other
sorrowfully
and
without
hope
it
is
an
image
of
the
condition
of
men
a
man
in
a
dungeon
ignorant
whether
his
sentence
be
pronounced
and
having
only
one
hour
to
learn
it
but
this
hour
enough
if
he
know
that
it
is
pronounced
to
obtain
its
repeal
would
act
unnaturally
in
spending
that
hour
not
in
ascertaining
his
sentence
but
in
playing
piquet
so
it
is
against
nature
that
man
etc
it
is
making
heavy
the
hand
of
god
thus
not
only
the
zeal
of
those
who
seek
him
proves
god
but
also
the
blindness
of
those
who
seek
him
not
all
the
objections
of
this
one
and
that
one
only
go
against
themselves
and
not
against
religion
all
that
infidels
say
from
those
who
are
in
despair
at
being
without
faith
we
see
that
god
does
not
enlighten
them
but
as
to
the
rest
we
see
there
is
a
god
who
makes
them
blind
that
passion
may
not
harm
us
let
us
act
as
if
we
had
only
eight
hours
to
live
if
we
ought
to
devote
eight
hours
of
life
we
ought
to
devote
a
hundred
years
when
i
consider
the
short
duration
of
my
life
swallowed
up
in
the
eternity
before
and
after
the
little
space
which
i
fill
and
even
can
see
engulfed
in
the
infinite
immensity
of
spaces
of
which
i
am
ignorant
and
which
know
me
not
i
am
frightened
and
am
astonished
at
being
here
rather
than
there
for
there
is
no
reason
why
here
rather
than
there
why
now
rather
than
then
who
has
put
me
here
by
whose
order
and
direction
have
this
place
and
time
been
allotted
to
me
hospitis
unius
diei
the
eternal
silence
of
these
infinite
spaces
frightens
me
how
many
kingdoms
know
us
not
why
is
my
knowledge
limited
why
my
stature
why
my
life
to
one
hundred
years
rather
than
to
a
thousand
what
reason
has
nature
had
for
giving
me
such
and
for
choosing
this
number
rather
than
another
in
the
infinity
of
those
from
which
there
is
no
more
reason
to
choose
one
than
another
trying
nothing
else
art
thou
less
a
slave
by
being
loved
and
favoured
by
thy
master
thou
art
indeed
well
off
slave
thy
master
favours
thee
he
will
soon
beat
thee
the
last
act
is
tragic
however
happy
all
the
rest
of
the
play
is
at
the
last
a
little
earth
is
thrown
upon
our
head
and
that
is
the
end
for
ever
we
are
fools
to
depend
upon
the
society
of
our
wretched
as
we
are
powerless
as
we
are
they
will
not
aid
us
we
shall
die
alone
we
should
therefore
act
as
if
we
were
alone
and
in
that
case
should
we
build
fine
houses
we
should
seek
the
truth
without
hesitation
and
if
we
refuse
it
we
show
that
we
value
the
esteem
of
men
more
than
the
search
for
truth
it
is
a
horrible
thing
to
feel
all
that
we
possess
slipping
away
between
us
and
heaven
or
hell
there
is
only
life
which
is
the
frailest
thing
in
the
world
that
presumption
should
be
joined
to
meanness
is
extreme
injustice
to
fear
death
without
danger
and
not
in
danger
for
one
must
be
a
man
sudden
death
alone
is
feared
hence
confessors
stay
with
lords
an
heir
finds
the
of
his
house
will
he
say
perhaps
they
are
forged
and
neglect
to
examine
them
i
approve
of
not
examining
the
opinion
of
copernicus
but
this
it
concerns
all
our
life
to
know
whether
the
soul
be
mortal
or
immortal
it
is
certain
that
the
mortality
or
immortality
of
the
soul
must
make
an
entire
difference
to
morality
and
yet
philosophers
have
constructed
their
ethics
independently
of
this
they
discuss
to
pass
an
hour
plato
to
incline
to
christianity
the
fallacy
of
philosophers
who
have
not
discussed
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
fallacy
of
their
dilemma
in
montaigne
atheists
ought
to
say
what
is
perfectly
evident
now
it
is
not
perfectly
evident
that
the
soul
is
material
what
reason
have
they
for
saying
that
we
can
not
rise
from
the
dead
what
is
more
difficult
to
be
born
or
to
rise
again
that
what
has
never
been
should
be
or
that
what
has
been
should
be
again
is
it
more
difficult
to
come
into
existence
than
to
return
to
it
habit
makes
the
one
appear
easy
to
us
want
of
habit
makes
the
other
impossible
a
popular
way
of
thinking
why
can
not
a
virgin
bear
a
child
does
a
hen
not
lay
eggs
without
a
cock
what
distinguishes
these
outwardly
from
others
and
who
has
told
us
that
the
hen
may
not
form
the
germ
as
well
as
the
cock
what
have
they
to
say
against
the
resurrection
and
against
the
of
the
virgin
which
is
the
more
difficult
to
produce
a
man
or
an
animal
or
to
reproduce
it
and
if
they
had
never
seen
any
species
of
animals
could
they
have
conjectured
whether
they
were
produced
without
connection
with
each
other
how
i
hate
these
follies
of
not
believing
in
the
eucharist
if
the
gospel
be
true
if
jesus
christ
be
god
what
difficulty
is
there
atheism
shows
strength
of
mind
but
only
to
a
certain
degree
infidels
who
profess
to
follow
reason
ought
to
be
exceedingly
strong
in
reason
what
say
they
then
do
we
not
see
say
they
that
the
brutes
live
and
die
like
men
and
turks
like
christians
they
have
their
ceremonies
their
prophets
their
doctors
their
saints
their
monks
like
us
etc
is
this
contrary
to
scripture
does
it
not
say
all
this
if
you
care
but
little
to
know
the
truth
here
is
enough
of
it
to
leave
you
in
repose
but
if
you
desire
with
all
your
heart
to
know
it
it
is
not
enough
look
at
it
in
detail
this
would
be
sufficient
for
a
question
in
philosophy
but
not
here
where
it
concerns
your
all
and
yet
after
a
trifling
reflection
of
this
kind
we
go
to
amuse
ourselves
etc
let
us
inquire
of
this
same
religion
whether
it
does
not
give
a
reason
for
this
obscurity
perhaps
it
will
teach
it
to
us
by
what
ought
i
to
do
i
see
only
darkness
everywhere
shall
i
believe
i
am
nothing
shall
i
believe
i
am
god
all
things
change
and
succeed
each
other
you
are
mistaken
there
is
objection
of
atheists
but
we
have
no
light
this
is
what
i
see
and
what
troubles
me
i
look
on
all
sides
and
i
see
only
darkness
everywhere
nature
presents
to
me
nothing
which
is
not
matter
of
doubt
and
concern
if
i
saw
nothing
there
which
revealed
a
divinity
i
would
come
to
a
negative
conclusion
if
i
saw
everywhere
the
signs
of
a
creator
i
would
remain
peacefully
in
faith
but
seeing
too
much
to
deny
and
too
little
to
be
sure
i
am
in
a
state
to
be
pitied
wherefore
i
have
a
hundred
time
wished
that
if
a
god
maintains
nature
she
should
testify
to
him
unequivocally
and
that
if
the
signs
she
gives
are
deceptive
she
should
suppress
them
altogether
that
she
should
say
everything
or
nothing
that
i
might
see
which
cause
i
ought
to
follow
whereas
in
my
present
state
ignorant
of
what
i
am
or
of
what
i
ought
to
do
i
know
neither
my
condition
nor
my
duty
my
heart
inclines
wholly
to
know
where
is
the
true
good
in
order
to
follow
it
nothing
would
be
too
dear
to
me
for
eternity
i
envy
those
whom
i
see
living
in
the
faith
with
such
carelessness
and
who
make
such
a
bad
use
of
a
gift
of
which
it
seems
to
me
i
would
make
such
a
different
use
it
is
incomprehensible
that
god
should
exist
and
it
is
incomprehensible
that
he
should
not
exist
that
the
soul
should
be
joined
to
the
body
and
that
we
should
have
no
soul
that
the
world
should
be
created
and
that
it
should
not
be
created
etc
that
original
sin
should
be
and
that
it
should
not
be
do
you
believe
it
to
be
impossible
that
god
is
infinite
without
parts
yes
i
wish
therefore
to
show
you
an
infinite
and
indivisible
thing
it
is
a
point
moving
everywhere
with
an
infinite
velocity
for
it
is
one
in
all
places
and
is
all
totality
in
every
place
let
this
effect
of
nature
which
previously
seemed
to
you
impossible
make
you
know
that
there
may
be
others
of
which
you
are
still
ignorant
do
not
draw
this
conclusion
from
your
experiment
that
there
remains
nothing
for
you
to
know
but
rather
that
there
remains
an
infinity
for
you
to
know
infinite
movement
the
point
which
fills
everything
the
moment
of
rest
infinite
without
quantity
indivisible
and
infinite
our
soul
is
cast
into
a
body
where
it
finds
number
time
dimension
thereupon
it
reasons
and
calls
this
nature
necessity
and
can
believe
nothing
else
unity
joined
to
infinity
adds
nothing
to
it
no
more
than
one
foot
to
an
infinite
measure
the
finite
is
annihilated
in
the
presence
of
the
infinite
and
becomes
a
pure
nothing
so
our
spirit
before
god
so
our
justice
before
divine
justice
there
is
not
so
great
a
disproportion
between
our
justice
and
that
of
god
as
between
unity
and
infinity
the
justice
of
god
must
be
vast
like
his
compassion
now
justice
to
the
outcast
is
less
vast
and
ought
less
to
offend
our
feelings
than
mercy
towards
the
elect
we
know
that
there
is
an
infinite
and
are
ignorant
of
its
nature
as
we
know
it
to
be
false
that
numbers
are
finite
it
is
therefore
true
that
there
is
an
infinity
in
number
but
we
do
not
know
what
it
is
it
is
false
that
it
is
even
it
is
false
that
it
is
odd
for
the
addition
of
a
unit
can
make
no
change
in
its
nature
yet
it
is
a
number
and
every
number
is
odd
or
even
this
is
certainly
true
of
every
finite
number
so
we
may
well
know
that
there
is
a
god
without
knowing
what
he
is
is
there
not
one
substantial
truth
seeing
there
are
so
many
things
which
are
not
the
truth
itself
we
know
then
the
existence
and
nature
of
the
finite
because
we
also
are
finite
and
have
extension
we
know
the
existence
of
the
infinite
and
are
ignorant
of
its
nature
because
it
has
extension
like
us
but
not
limits
like
us
but
we
know
neither
the
existence
nor
the
nature
of
god
because
he
has
neither
extension
nor
limits
but
by
faith
we
know
his
existence
in
glory
we
shall
know
his
nature
now
i
have
already
shown
that
we
may
well
know
the
existence
of
a
thing
without
knowing
its
nature
let
us
now
speak
according
to
natural
lights
if
there
is
a
god
he
is
infinitely
incomprehensible
since
having
neither
parts
nor
limits
he
has
no
affinity
to
us
we
are
then
incapable
of
knowing
either
what
he
is
or
if
he
is
this
being
so
who
will
dare
to
undertake
the
decision
of
the
question
not
we
who
have
no
affinity
to
him
who
then
will
blame
christians
for
not
being
able
to
give
a
reason
for
their
belief
since
they
profess
a
religion
for
which
they
can
not
give
a
reason
they
declare
in
expounding
it
to
the
world
that
it
is
a
foolishness
and
then
you
complain
that
they
do
not
prove
it
if
they
proved
it
they
would
not
keep
their
word
it
is
in
lacking
proofs
that
they
are
not
lacking
in
sense
yes
but
although
this
excuses
those
who
offer
it
as
such
and
takes
away
from
them
the
blame
of
putting
it
forward
without
reason
it
does
not
excuse
those
who
receive
it
let
us
then
examine
this
point
and
say
god
is
or
he
is
not
but
to
which
side
shall
we
incline
reason
can
decide
nothing
here
there
is
an
infinite
chaos
which
separated
us
a
game
is
being
played
at
the
extremity
of
this
infinite
distance
where
heads
or
tails
will
turn
up
what
will
you
wager
according
to
reason
you
can
do
neither
the
one
thing
nor
the
other
according
to
reason
you
can
defend
neither
of
the
propositions
do
not
then
reprove
for
error
those
who
have
made
a
choice
for
you
know
nothing
about
it
no
but
i
blame
them
for
having
made
not
this
choice
but
a
choice
for
again
both
he
who
chooses
heads
and
he
who
chooses
tails
are
equally
at
fault
they
are
both
in
the
wrong
the
true
course
is
not
to
wager
at
all
yes
but
you
must
wager
it
is
not
optional
you
are
embarked
which
will
you
choose
then
let
us
see
since
you
must
choose
let
us
see
which
interests
you
least
you
have
two
things
to
lose
the
true
and
the
good
and
two
things
to
stake
your
reason
and
your
will
your
knowledge
and
your
happiness
and
your
nature
has
two
things
to
shun
error
and
misery
your
reason
is
no
more
shocked
in
choosing
one
rather
than
the
other
since
you
must
of
necessity
choose
this
is
one
point
settled
but
your
happiness
let
us
weigh
the
gain
and
the
loss
in
wagering
that
god
is
let
us
estimate
these
two
chances
if
you
gain
you
gain
all
if
you
lose
you
lose
nothing
wager
then
without
hesitation
that
he
that
is
very
fine
yes
i
must
wager
but
i
may
perhaps
wager
too
much
let
us
see
since
there
is
an
equal
risk
of
gain
and
of
loss
if
you
had
only
to
gain
two
lives
instead
of
one
you
might
still
wager
but
if
there
were
three
lives
to
gain
you
would
have
to
play
since
you
are
under
the
necessity
of
playing
and
you
would
be
imprudent
when
you
are
forced
to
play
not
to
chance
your
life
to
gain
three
at
a
game
where
there
is
an
equal
risk
of
loss
and
gain
but
there
is
an
eternity
of
life
and
happiness
and
this
being
so
if
there
were
an
infinity
of
chances
of
which
one
only
would
be
for
you
you
would
still
be
right
in
wagering
one
to
win
two
and
you
would
act
stupidly
being
obliged
to
play
by
refusing
to
stake
one
life
against
three
at
a
game
in
which
out
of
an
infinity
of
chances
there
is
one
for
you
if
there
were
an
infinity
of
an
infinitely
happy
life
to
gain
but
there
is
here
an
infinity
of
an
infinitely
happy
life
to
gain
a
chance
of
gain
against
a
finite
number
of
chances
of
loss
and
what
you
stake
is
finite
it
is
all
divided
wherever
the
infinite
is
and
there
is
not
an
infinity
of
chances
of
loss
against
that
of
gain
there
is
no
time
to
hesitate
you
must
give
all
and
thus
when
one
is
forced
to
play
he
must
renounce
reason
to
preserve
his
life
rather
than
risk
it
for
infinite
gain
as
likely
to
happen
as
the
loss
of
nothingness
for
it
is
no
use
to
say
it
is
uncertain
if
we
will
gain
and
it
is
certain
that
we
risk
and
that
the
infinite
distance
between
the
of
what
is
staked
and
the
of
what
will
be
gained
equals
the
finite
good
which
is
certainly
staked
against
the
uncertain
infinite
it
is
not
so
as
every
player
stakes
a
certainty
to
gain
an
uncertainty
and
yet
he
stakes
a
finite
certainty
to
gain
a
finite
uncertainty
without
transgressing
against
reason
there
is
not
an
infinite
distance
between
the
certainty
staked
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
gain
that
is
untrue
in
truth
there
is
an
infinity
between
the
certainty
of
gain
and
the
certainty
of
loss
but
the
uncertainty
of
the
gain
is
proportioned
to
the
certainty
of
the
stake
according
to
the
proportion
of
the
chances
of
gain
and
loss
hence
it
comes
that
if
there
are
as
many
risks
on
one
side
as
on
the
other
the
course
is
to
play
even
and
then
the
certainty
of
the
stake
is
equal
to
the
uncertainty
of
the
gain
so
far
is
it
from
fact
that
there
is
an
infinite
distance
between
them
and
so
our
proposition
is
of
infinite
force
when
there
is
the
finite
to
stake
in
a
game
where
there
are
equal
risks
of
gain
and
of
loss
and
the
infinite
to
gain
this
is
demonstrable
and
if
men
are
capable
of
any
truths
this
is
one
i
confess
it
i
admit
it
but
still
is
there
no
means
of
seeing
the
faces
of
the
cards
yes
scripture
and
the
rest
etc
yes
but
i
have
my
hands
tied
and
my
mouth
closed
i
am
forced
to
wager
and
am
not
free
i
am
not
released
and
am
so
made
that
i
can
not
believe
what
then
would
you
have
me
do
true
but
at
least
learn
your
inability
to
believe
since
reason
brings
you
to
this
and
yet
you
can
not
believe
endeavour
then
to
convince
yourself
not
by
increase
of
proofs
of
god
but
by
the
abatement
of
your
passions
you
would
like
to
attain
faith
and
do
not
know
the
way
you
would
like
to
cure
yourself
of
unbelief
and
ask
the
remedy
for
it
learn
of
those
who
have
been
bound
like
you
and
who
now
stake
all
their
possessions
these
are
people
who
know
the
way
which
you
would
follow
and
who
are
cured
of
an
ill
of
which
you
would
be
cured
follow
the
way
by
which
they
began
by
acting
as
if
they
believed
taking
the
holy
water
having
masses
said
etc
even
this
will
naturally
make
you
believe
and
deaden
your
but
this
is
what
i
am
afraid
of
and
why
what
have
you
to
lose
but
to
show
you
that
this
leads
you
there
it
is
this
which
will
lessen
the
passions
which
are
your
end
of
this
now
what
harm
will
befall
you
in
taking
this
side
you
will
be
faithful
honest
humble
grateful
generous
a
sincere
friend
truthful
certainly
you
will
not
have
those
poisonous
pleasures
glory
and
luxury
but
will
you
not
have
others
i
will
tell
you
that
you
will
thereby
gain
in
this
life
and
that
at
each
step
you
take
on
this
road
you
will
see
so
great
certainty
of
gain
so
much
nothingness
in
what
you
risk
that
you
will
at
last
recognise
that
you
have
wagered
for
something
certain
and
infinite
for
which
you
have
given
nothing
ah
this
discourse
transports
me
charms
me
etc
if
this
discourse
pleases
you
and
seems
impressive
know
that
it
is
made
by
a
man
who
has
knelt
both
before
and
after
it
in
prayer
to
that
being
infinite
and
without
parts
before
whom
he
lays
all
he
has
for
you
also
to
lay
before
him
all
you
have
for
your
own
good
and
for
his
glory
that
so
strength
may
be
given
to
lowliness
if
we
must
not
act
save
on
a
certainty
we
ought
not
to
act
on
religion
for
it
is
not
certain
but
how
many
things
we
do
on
an
uncertainty
sea
voyages
battles
i
say
then
we
must
do
nothing
at
all
for
nothing
is
certain
and
that
there
is
more
certainty
in
religion
than
there
is
as
to
whether
we
may
see
for
it
is
not
certain
that
we
may
see
and
it
is
certainly
possible
that
we
may
not
see
it
we
can
not
say
as
much
about
religion
it
is
not
certain
that
it
is
but
who
will
venture
to
say
that
it
is
certainly
possible
that
it
is
not
now
when
we
work
for
and
so
on
an
uncertainty
we
act
reasonably
for
we
ought
to
work
for
an
uncertainty
according
to
the
doctrine
of
chance
which
was
demonstrated
above
saint
augustine
has
seen
that
we
work
for
an
uncertainty
on
sea
in
battle
etc
but
he
has
not
seen
the
doctrine
of
chance
which
proves
that
we
should
do
so
montaigne
has
seen
that
we
are
shocked
at
a
fool
and
that
habit
is
but
he
has
not
seen
the
reason
of
this
effect
all
these
persons
have
seen
the
effects
but
they
have
not
seen
the
causes
they
are
in
comparison
with
those
who
have
discovered
the
causes
as
those
who
have
only
eyes
are
in
comparison
with
those
who
have
intellect
for
the
effects
are
perceptible
by
sense
and
the
causes
are
visible
only
to
the
intellect
and
although
these
effects
are
seen
by
the
mind
this
mind
is
in
comparison
with
the
mind
which
sees
the
causes
as
the
bodily
senses
are
in
comparison
with
the
intellect
viderunt
causam
non
according
to
the
doctrine
of
chance
you
ought
to
put
yourself
to
the
trouble
of
searching
for
the
truth
for
if
you
die
without
worshipping
the
true
cause
you
are
but
say
you
if
he
had
wished
me
to
worship
him
he
would
have
left
me
signs
of
his
will
he
has
done
so
but
you
neglect
them
seek
them
therefore
it
is
well
worth
it
we
must
live
differently
in
the
world
according
to
these
different
assumptions
that
we
could
always
remain
in
it
that
it
is
certain
that
we
shall
not
remain
here
long
and
uncertain
if
we
shall
remain
here
one
hour
this
last
assumption
is
our
condition
what
do
you
then
promise
me
in
addition
to
certain
troubles
but
ten
years
of
for
ten
years
is
the
chance
to
try
hard
to
please
without
success
those
who
hope
for
salvation
are
so
far
happy
but
they
have
as
a
counterpoise
the
fear
of
hell
who
has
most
reason
to
fear
hell
he
who
is
in
ignorance
whether
there
is
a
hell
and
who
is
certain
of
damnation
if
there
is
or
he
who
certainly
believes
there
is
a
hell
and
hopes
to
be
saved
if
there
is
i
would
soon
have
renounced
pleasure
say
they
had
i
faith
for
my
part
i
tell
you
you
would
soon
have
faith
if
you
renounced
pleasure
now
it
is
for
you
to
begin
if
i
could
i
would
give
you
faith
i
can
not
do
so
nor
therefore
test
the
truth
of
what
you
say
but
you
can
well
renounce
pleasure
and
test
whether
what
i
say
is
true
i
would
have
far
more
fear
of
being
mistaken
and
of
finding
that
the
christian
religion
was
true
than
of
not
being
mistaken
in
believing
it
true
section
iv
of
the
means
of
belief
to
the
second
to
speak
of
those
who
have
treated
of
this
matter
i
admire
the
boldness
with
which
these
persons
undertake
to
speak
of
god
in
addressing
their
argument
to
infidels
their
first
chapter
is
to
prove
divinity
from
the
works
of
nature
i
should
not
be
astonished
at
their
enterprise
if
they
were
addressing
their
argument
to
the
faithful
for
it
is
certain
that
those
who
have
the
living
faith
in
their
heart
see
at
once
that
all
existence
is
none
other
than
the
work
of
the
god
whom
they
adore
but
for
those
in
whom
this
light
is
extinguished
and
in
whom
we
purpose
to
rekindle
it
persons
destitute
of
faith
and
grace
who
seeking
with
all
their
light
whatever
they
see
in
nature
that
can
bring
them
to
this
knowledge
find
only
obscurity
and
darkness
to
tell
them
that
they
have
only
to
look
at
the
smallest
things
which
surround
them
and
they
will
see
god
openly
to
give
them
as
a
complete
proof
of
this
great
and
important
matter
the
course
of
the
moon
and
planets
and
to
claim
to
have
concluded
the
proof
with
such
an
argument
is
to
give
them
ground
for
believing
that
the
proofs
of
our
religion
are
very
weak
and
i
see
by
reason
and
experience
that
nothing
is
more
calculated
to
arouse
their
contempt
it
is
not
after
this
manner
that
scripture
speaks
which
has
a
better
knowledge
of
the
things
that
are
of
god
it
says
on
the
contrary
that
god
is
a
hidden
god
and
that
since
the
corruption
of
nature
he
has
left
men
in
a
darkness
from
which
they
can
escape
only
through
jesus
christ
without
whom
all
communion
with
god
is
cut
off
novit
patrem
nisi
filius
et
cui
voluerit
filius
this
is
what
scripture
points
out
to
us
when
it
says
in
so
many
places
that
those
who
seek
god
find
him
it
is
not
of
that
light
like
the
noonday
sun
that
this
is
said
we
do
not
say
that
those
who
seek
the
noonday
sun
or
water
in
the
sea
shall
find
them
and
hence
the
evidence
of
god
must
not
be
of
this
nature
so
it
tells
us
elsewhere
tu
es
deus
it
is
an
astounding
fact
that
no
canonical
writer
has
ever
made
use
of
nature
to
prove
god
they
all
strive
to
make
us
believe
in
him
david
solomon
have
never
said
there
is
no
void
therefore
there
is
a
god
they
must
have
had
more
knowledge
than
the
most
learned
people
who
came
after
them
and
who
have
all
made
use
of
this
argument
this
is
worthy
of
attention
why
do
you
not
say
yourself
that
the
heavens
and
birds
prove
god
no
and
does
your
religion
not
say
so
no
for
although
it
is
true
in
a
sense
for
some
souls
to
whom
god
gives
this
light
yet
it
is
false
with
respect
to
the
majority
of
men
there
are
three
sources
of
belief
reason
custom
inspiration
the
christian
religion
which
alone
has
reason
does
not
acknowledge
as
her
true
children
those
who
believe
without
inspiration
it
is
not
that
she
excludes
reason
and
custom
on
the
contrary
the
mind
must
be
opened
to
proofs
must
be
confirmed
by
custom
and
offer
itself
in
humbleness
to
inspirations
which
alone
can
produce
a
true
and
saving
effect
evacuetur
crux
after
the
letter
we
ought
to
seek
to
write
the
letter
removing
which
is
the
discourse
on
the
machine
on
preparing
the
machine
on
seeking
by
reason
a
letter
of
exhortation
to
a
friend
to
induce
him
to
seek
and
he
will
reply
but
what
is
the
use
of
seeking
nothing
is
seen
then
to
reply
to
him
do
not
despair
and
he
will
answer
that
he
would
be
glad
to
find
some
light
but
that
according
to
this
very
religion
if
he
believed
in
it
it
will
be
of
no
use
to
him
and
that
therefore
he
prefers
not
to
seek
and
to
answer
to
that
the
machine
letter
which
indicates
the
use
of
proofs
by
the
faith
is
different
from
proof
the
one
is
human
the
other
is
a
gift
of
god
ex
fide
it
is
this
faith
that
god
himself
puts
into
the
heart
of
which
the
proof
is
often
the
instrument
ex
but
this
faith
is
in
the
heart
and
makes
us
not
say
but
it
is
superstition
to
put
one
hope
in
formalities
but
it
is
pride
to
be
unwilling
to
submit
to
them
the
external
must
be
joined
to
the
internal
to
obtain
anything
from
god
that
is
to
say
we
must
kneel
pray
with
the
lips
in
order
that
proud
man
who
would
not
submit
himself
to
god
may
be
now
subject
to
the
creature
to
expect
help
from
these
externals
is
superstition
to
refuse
to
join
them
to
the
internal
is
pride
other
religions
as
the
pagan
are
more
popular
for
they
consist
in
externals
but
they
are
not
for
educated
people
a
purely
intellectual
religion
would
be
more
suited
to
the
learned
but
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
the
common
people
the
christian
religion
alone
is
adapted
to
all
being
composed
of
externals
and
internals
it
raises
the
common
people
to
the
internal
and
humbles
the
proud
to
the
external
it
is
not
perfect
without
the
two
for
the
people
must
understand
the
spirit
of
the
letter
and
the
learned
must
submit
their
spirit
to
the
letter
for
we
must
not
misunderstand
ourselves
we
are
as
much
automatic
as
intellectual
and
hence
it
comes
that
the
instrument
by
which
conviction
is
attained
is
not
demonstrated
alone
how
few
things
are
demonstrated
proofs
only
convince
the
mind
custom
is
the
source
of
our
strongest
and
most
believed
proofs
it
bends
the
automaton
which
persuades
the
mind
without
its
thinking
about
the
matter
who
has
demonstrated
that
there
will
be
a
and
that
we
shall
die
and
what
is
more
believed
it
is
then
custom
which
persuades
us
of
it
it
is
custom
that
makes
so
many
men
christians
custom
that
makes
them
turks
heathens
artisans
soldiers
etc
faith
in
baptism
is
more
received
among
christians
than
among
turks
finally
we
must
have
recourse
to
it
when
once
the
mind
has
seen
where
the
truth
is
in
order
to
quench
our
thirst
and
steep
ourselves
in
that
belief
which
escapes
us
at
every
hour
for
always
to
have
proofs
ready
is
too
much
trouble
we
must
get
an
easier
belief
which
is
that
of
custom
which
without
violence
without
art
without
argument
makes
us
believe
things
and
inclines
all
our
powers
to
this
belief
so
that
out
soul
falls
naturally
into
it
it
is
not
enough
to
believe
only
by
force
of
conviction
when
the
automaton
is
inclined
to
believe
the
contrary
both
our
parts
must
be
made
to
believe
the
mind
by
reasons
which
it
is
sufficient
to
have
seen
once
in
a
lifetime
and
the
automaton
by
custom
and
by
not
allowing
it
to
incline
to
the
contrary
cor
meum
the
reason
acts
slowly
with
so
many
examinations
and
on
so
many
principles
which
must
be
always
present
that
at
every
hour
it
falls
asleep
or
wanders
through
want
of
having
all
its
principles
present
feeling
does
not
act
thus
it
acts
in
a
moment
and
is
always
ready
to
act
we
must
then
put
our
faith
in
feeling
otherwise
it
will
be
always
vacillating
two
extremes
to
exclude
reason
to
admit
reason
only
it
is
not
a
rare
thing
to
have
to
reprove
the
world
for
too
much
docility
it
is
a
natural
vice
like
credulity
and
as
pernicious
superstition
piety
is
different
from
superstition
to
carry
piety
as
far
as
superstition
is
to
destroy
it
the
heretics
reproach
us
for
this
superstitious
submission
this
is
to
do
what
they
reproach
us
for
infidelity
not
to
believe
in
the
eucharist
because
it
is
not
seen
superstition
to
believe
propositions
faith
etc
i
say
there
are
few
true
christians
even
as
regards
faith
there
are
many
who
believe
but
from
superstition
there
are
many
who
do
not
believe
solely
from
wickedness
few
are
between
the
two
in
this
i
do
not
include
those
who
are
of
truly
pious
character
nor
all
those
who
believe
from
a
feeling
in
their
heart
there
are
only
three
kinds
of
persons
those
who
serve
god
having
found
him
others
who
are
occupied
in
seeking
him
not
having
found
him
while
the
remainder
live
without
seeking
him
and
without
having
found
him
the
first
are
reasonable
and
happy
the
last
are
foolish
and
unhappy
those
between
are
unhappy
and
reasonable
sibi
deum
disgust
ordinary
people
have
the
power
of
not
thinking
of
that
about
which
they
do
not
wish
to
think
do
not
meditate
on
the
passages
about
the
messiah
said
the
jew
to
his
son
thus
our
people
often
act
thus
are
false
religions
preserved
and
even
the
true
one
in
regard
to
many
persons
but
there
are
some
who
have
not
the
power
of
thus
preventing
thought
and
who
think
so
much
the
more
as
they
are
forbidden
these
undo
false
religions
and
even
the
true
one
if
they
do
not
find
solid
arguments
they
hide
themselves
in
the
press
and
call
numbers
to
their
rescue
tumult
so
far
from
making
it
a
rule
to
believe
a
thing
because
you
have
heard
it
you
ought
to
believe
nothing
without
putting
yourself
into
the
position
as
if
you
had
never
heard
it
it
is
your
own
assent
to
yourself
and
the
constant
voice
of
your
own
reason
and
not
of
others
that
should
make
you
believe
belief
is
so
important
a
hundred
contradictions
might
be
true
if
antiquity
were
the
rule
of
belief
men
of
ancient
time
would
then
be
without
rule
if
general
consent
if
men
had
perished
false
humanity
pride
lift
the
curtain
you
try
in
vain
if
you
must
either
believe
or
deny
or
doubt
shall
we
then
have
no
rule
we
judge
that
animals
do
well
what
they
do
is
there
no
rule
whereby
to
judge
men
to
deny
to
believe
and
to
doubt
well
are
to
a
man
what
the
race
is
to
a
horse
punishment
of
those
who
sin
error
those
who
do
not
love
the
truth
take
as
a
pretext
that
it
is
disputed
and
that
a
multitude
deny
it
and
so
their
error
arises
only
from
this
that
they
do
not
love
either
truth
or
charity
thus
they
are
without
excuse
superstition
and
lust
scruples
evil
desires
evil
fear
fear
not
such
as
comes
from
a
belief
in
god
but
such
as
comes
from
a
doubt
whether
he
exists
or
not
true
fear
comes
from
faith
false
fear
comes
from
doubt
true
fear
is
joined
to
hope
because
it
is
born
of
faith
and
because
men
hope
in
the
god
in
whom
they
believe
false
fear
is
joined
to
despair
because
men
fear
the
god
in
whom
they
have
no
belief
the
former
fear
to
lose
him
the
latter
fear
to
find
him
a
miracle
says
one
would
strengthen
my
faith
he
says
so
when
he
does
not
see
one
reasons
seen
from
afar
appear
to
limit
our
view
but
when
they
are
reached
we
begin
to
see
beyond
nothing
stops
the
nimbleness
of
our
mind
there
is
no
rule
say
we
which
has
not
some
exceptions
no
truth
so
general
which
has
not
some
aspect
in
which
it
fails
it
is
sufficient
that
it
be
not
absolutely
universal
to
give
us
a
pretext
for
applying
the
exceptions
to
the
present
subject
and
for
saying
this
is
not
always
true
there
are
therefore
cases
where
it
is
not
so
it
only
remains
to
show
that
this
is
one
of
them
and
that
is
why
we
are
very
awkward
or
unlucky
if
we
do
not
find
one
some
day
we
do
not
weary
of
eating
and
sleeping
every
day
for
hunger
and
sleepiness
recur
without
that
we
should
weary
of
them
so
without
the
hunger
for
spiritual
things
we
weary
of
them
hunger
after
righteousness
the
eighth
beatitude
faith
indeed
tells
what
the
senses
do
not
tell
but
not
the
contrary
of
what
they
see
it
is
above
them
and
not
contrary
to
them
how
many
stars
have
telescopes
revealed
to
us
which
did
not
exist
for
our
philosophers
of
old
we
freely
attack
holy
scripture
on
the
great
number
of
stars
saying
there
are
only
one
thousand
and
we
know
it
there
is
grass
on
the
earth
we
see
it
from
the
moon
we
would
not
see
it
and
on
the
grass
are
leaves
and
in
these
leaves
are
small
animals
but
after
that
no
o
presumptuous
man
the
compounds
are
composed
of
elements
and
the
elements
o
presumptuous
man
here
is
a
fine
we
must
not
say
that
there
is
anything
which
we
do
not
we
must
then
talk
like
others
but
not
think
like
them
the
last
proceeding
of
reason
is
to
recognise
that
there
is
an
infinity
of
things
which
are
beyond
it
it
is
but
feeble
if
it
does
not
see
so
far
as
to
know
this
but
if
natural
things
are
beyond
it
what
will
be
said
of
supernatural
we
must
know
where
to
doubt
where
to
feel
certain
where
to
submit
he
who
does
not
do
so
understands
not
the
force
of
reason
there
are
some
who
offend
against
these
three
rules
either
by
affirming
everything
as
demonstrative
from
want
of
knowing
what
demonstration
is
or
by
doubting
everything
from
want
of
knowing
where
to
submit
or
by
submitting
in
everything
from
want
of
knowing
where
they
must
judge
submission
is
the
use
of
reason
in
which
consists
true
christianity
reason
would
never
submit
if
it
did
not
judge
that
there
are
some
occasions
on
which
it
ought
to
submit
it
is
then
right
for
it
to
submit
when
it
judges
that
it
ought
to
submit
wisdom
sends
us
to
childhood
efficiamini
sicut
there
is
nothing
so
conformable
to
reason
as
this
disavowal
of
reason
if
we
submit
everything
to
reason
our
religion
will
have
no
mysterious
and
supernatural
element
if
we
offend
the
principles
of
reason
our
religion
will
be
absurd
and
ridiculous
all
our
reasoning
reduces
itself
to
yielding
to
feeling
but
fancy
is
like
though
contrary
to
feeling
so
that
we
can
not
distinguish
between
these
contraries
one
person
says
that
my
feeling
is
fancy
another
that
his
fancy
is
feeling
we
should
have
a
rule
reason
offers
itself
but
it
is
pliable
in
every
sense
and
thus
there
is
no
rule
men
often
take
their
imagination
for
their
heart
and
they
believe
they
are
converted
as
soon
as
they
think
of
being
converted
de

said
reasons
come
to
me
afterwards
but
at
first
a
thing
pleases
or
shocks
me
without
my
knowing
the
reason
and
yet
it
shocks
me
for
that
reason
which
i
only
discover
afterwards
but
i
believe
not
that
it
shocked
him
for
the
reasons
which
were
found
afterwards
but
that
these
reasons
were
only
found
because
it
shocks
him
the
heart
has
its
reasons
which
reason
does
not
know
we
feel
it
in
a
thousand
things
i
say
that
the
heart
naturally
loves
the
universal
being
and
also
itself
naturally
according
as
it
gives
itself
to
them
and
it
hardens
itself
against
one
or
the
other
at
its
will
you
have
rejected
the
one
and
kept
the
other
is
it
by
reason
that
you
love
yourself
it
is
the
heart
which
experiences
god
and
not
the
reason
this
then
is
faith
god
felt
by
the
heart
not
by
the
reason
faith
is
a
gift
of
god
do
not
believe
that
we
said
it
was
a
gift
of
reasoning
other
religions
do
not
say
this
of
their
faith
they
only
gave
reasoning
in
order
to
arrive
at
it
and
yet
it
does
not
bring
them
to
it
the
knowledge
of
god
is
very
far
from
the
love
of
him
heart
instinct
principles
we
know
truth
not
only
by
the
reason
but
also
by
the
heart
and
it
is
in
this
last
way
that
we
know
first
principles
and
reason
which
has
no
part
in
it
tries
in
vain
to
impugn
them
the
sceptics
who
have
only
this
for
their
object
labour
to
no
purpose
we
know
that
we
do
not
dream
and
however
impossible
it
is
for
us
to
prove
it
by
reason
this
inability
demonstrates
only
the
weakness
of
our
reason
but
not
as
they
affirm
the
uncertainty
of
all
our
knowledge
for
the
knowledge
of
first
principles
as
space
time
motion
number
is
as
sure
as
any
of
those
which
we
get
from
reasoning
and
reason
must
trust
these
intuitions
of
the
heart
and
must
base
them
on
every
argument
we
have
intuitive
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
space
and
of
the
infinity
of
number
and
reason
then
shows
that
there
are
no
two
square
numbers
one
of
which
is
double
of
the
other
principles
are
intuited
propositions
are
inferred
all
with
certainty
though
in
different
ways
and
it
is
as
useless
and
absurd
for
reason
to
demand
from
the
heart
proofs
of
her
first
principles
before
admitting
them
as
it
would
be
for
the
heart
to
demand
from
reason
an
intuition
of
all
demonstrated
propositions
before
accepting
them
this
inability
ought
then
to
serve
only
to
humble
reason
which
would
judge
all
but
not
to
impugn
our
certainty
as
if
only
reason
were
capable
of
instructing
us
would
to
god
on
the
contrary
that
we
had
never
need
of
it
and
that
we
knew
everything
by
instinct
and
intuition
but
nature
has
refused
us
this
boon
on
the
contrary
she
has
given
us
but
very
little
knowledge
of
this
kind
and
all
the
rest
can
be
acquired
only
by
reasoning
therefore
those
to
whom
god
has
imparted
religion
by
intuition
are
very
fortunate
and
justly
convinced
but
to
those
who
do
not
have
it
we
can
give
it
only
by
reasoning
waiting
for
god
to
give
them
spiritual
insight
without
which
faith
is
only
human
and
useless
for
salvation
against
the
objection
that
scripture
has
no
the
heart
has
its
own
order
the
intellect
has
its
own
which
is
by
principle
and
demonstration
the
heart
has
another
we
do
not
prove
that
we
ought
to
be
loved
by
enumerating
in
order
the
causes
of
love
that
would
be
ridiculous
jesus
christ
and
saint
paul
employ
the
rule
of
love
not
of
intellect
for
they
would
warm
not
instruct
it
is
the
same
with
saint
augustine
this
order
consists
chiefly
in
digressions
on
each
point
to
indicate
the
end
and
keep
it
always
in
sight
do
not
wonder
to
see
simple
people
believe
without
reasoning
god
imparts
to
them
love
of
him
and
hatred
of
self
he
inclines
their
heart
to
believe
men
will
never
believe
with
a
saving
and
real
faith
unless
god
inclines
their
heart
and
they
will
believe
as
soon
as
he
inclines
it
and
this
is
what
david
knew
well
when
he
said
cor
meum
deus
in
religion
is
suited
to
all
kinds
of
minds
some
pay
attention
only
to
its
establishment
and
this
religion
is
such
that
its
very
establishment
suffices
to
prove
its
truth
others
trace
it
even
to
the
apostles
the
more
learned
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
world
the
angels
see
it
better
still
and
from
a
more
distant
time
those
who
believe
without
having
read
the
testaments
do
so
because
they
have
an
inward
disposition
entirely
holy
and
all
that
they
hear
of
our
religion
conforms
to
it
they
feel
that
a
god
has
made
them
they
desire
only
to
love
god
they
desire
to
hate
themselves
only
they
feel
that
they
have
no
strength
in
themselves
that
they
are
incapable
of
coming
to
god
and
that
if
god
does
not
come
to
them
they
can
have
no
communion
with
him
and
they
hear
our
religion
say
that
men
must
love
god
only
and
hate
self
only
but
that
all
being
corrupt
and
unworthy
of
god
god
made
himself
man
to
unite
himself
to
us
no
more
is
required
to
persuade
men
who
have
this
disposition
in
their
heart
and
who
have
this
knowledge
of
their
duty
and
of
their
inefficiency
those
whom
we
see
to
be
christians
without
the
knowledge
of
the
prophets
and
evidences
nevertheless
judge
of
their
religion
as
well
as
those
who
have
that
knowledge
they
judge
of
it
by
the
heart
as
others
judge
of
it
by
the
intellect
god
himself
inclines
them
to
believe
and
thus
they
are
most
effectively
convinced
i
confess
indeed
that
one
of
those
christians
who
believe
without
proofs
will
not
perhaps
be
capable
of
convincing
an
infidel
who
will
say
the
same
of
himself
but
those
who
know
the
proofs
of
religion
will
prove
without
difficulty
that
such
a
believer
is
truly
inspired
by
god
though
he
can
not
prove
it
himself
for
god
having
said
in
his
prophecies
which
are
undoubtedly
prophecies
that
in
the
reign
of
jesus
christ
he
would
spread
his
spirit
abroad
among
nations
and
that
the
youths
and
maidens
and
children
of
the
church
would
prophesy
it
is
certain
that
the
spirit
of
god
is
in
these
and
not
in
the
others
instead
of
complaining
that
god
had
hidden
himself
you
will
give
him
thanks
for
having
revealed
so
much
of
himself
and
you
will
also
give
him
thanks
for
not
having
revealed
himself
to
haughty
sages
unworthy
to
know
so
holy
a
god
two
kinds
of
persons
know
him
those
who
have
a
humble
heart
and
who
love
lowliness
whatever
kind
of
intellect
they
may
have
high
or
low
and
those
who
have
sufficient
understanding
to
see
the
truth
whatever
opposition
they
may
have
to
it
the
christian
religion
by
its
establishment
having
established
itself
so
strongly
so
gently
whilst
contrary
to
the
sanctity
the
dignity
and
the
humility
of
a
christian
the
miracles
of
holy
jesus
christ
in
the
apostles
in
moses
and
the
prophets
in
the
jewish
the
perpetuity
no
religion
has
the
doctrine
which
gives
a
reason
for
the
sanctity
of
this
by
the
course
of
the
world
surely
after
considering
what
is
life
and
what
is
religion
we
should
not
refuse
to
obey
the
inclination
to
follow
it
if
it
comes
into
our
heart
and
it
is
certain
that
there
is
no
ground
for
laughing
at
those
who
follow
it
of
morality
doctrine
miracles
prophecies
types
section
v
justice
and
the
reason
of
effects
in
the
letter
can
come
the
ridiculousness
of
the
law
that
the
elder
gets
all
my
friend
you
were
born
on
this
side
of
the
mountain
it
is
therefore
just
that
your
elder
brother
gets
everything
why
do
you
kill
me
he
lives
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
why
do
you
kill
me
what
do
you
not
live
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
if
you
lived
on
this
side
my
friend
i
should
be
an
assassin
and
it
would
be
unjust
to
slay
you
in
this
manner
but
since
you
live
on
the
other
side
i
am
a
hero
and
it
is
just
on
what
shall
man
found
the
order
of
the
world
which
he
would
govern
shall
it
be
on
the
caprice
of
each
individual
what
confusion
shall
it
be
on
justice
man
is
ignorant
of
it
certainly
had
he
known
it
he
would
not
have
established
this
maxim
the
most
general
of
all
that
obtain
among
men
that
each
should
follow
the
custom
of
his
own
country
the
glory
of
true
equity
would
have
brought
all
nations
under
subjection
and
legislators
would
not
have
taken
as
their
model
the
fancies
and
caprice
of
persians
and
germans
instead
of
this
unchanging
justice
we
should
have
seen
it
set
up
in
all
the
states
on
earth
and
in
all
times
whereas
we
see
neither
justice
nor
injustice
which
does
not
change
its
nature
with
change
in
climate
three
degrees
of
latitude
reverse
all
jurisprudence
a
meridian
decides
the
truth
fundamental
laws
change
after
a
few
years
of
possession
right
has
its
epochs
the
entry
of
saturn
into
the
lion
marks
to
us
the
origin
of
such
and
such
a
crime
a
strange
justice
that
is
bounded
by
a
river
truth
on
this
side
of
the
pyrenees
error
on
the
other
side
men
admit
that
justice
does
not
consist
in
these
customs
but
that
it
resides
in
natural
laws
common
to
every
country
they
would
certainly
maintain
it
obstinately
if
reckless
chance
which
has
distributed
human
laws
had
encountered
even
one
which
was
universal
but
the
farce
is
that
the
caprice
of
men
has
so
many
vagaries
that
there
is
no
such
law
theft
incest
infanticide
parricide
have
all
had
a
place
among
virtuous
actions
can
anything
be
more
ridiculous
than
that
a
man
should
have
the
right
to
kill
me
because
he
lives
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
and
because
his
ruler
has
a
quarrel
with
mine
though
i
have
none
with
him
doubtless
there
are
natural
laws
but
good
reason
once
corrupted
has
corrupted

the
result
of
this
confusion
is
that
one
affirms
the
essence
of
justice
to
be
the
authority
of
the
legislator
another
the
interest
of
the
sovereign
another
present
custom
and
this
is
the
most
sure
nothing
according
to

alone
is
just
in
itself
all
changes
with
time
custom
creates
the
whole
of
equity
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
is
accepted
it
is
the
mystical
foundation
of
its
authority
whoever
carries
it
back
to
first
principles
destroys
it
nothing
is
so
faulty
as
those
laws
which
correct
faults
he
who
obeys
them
because
they
are
just
obeys
a
justice
which
is
imaginary
and
not
the
essence
of

it
is
quite
it
is
law
and
nothing
more
he
who
will
examine
its
motive
will
find
it
so
feeble
and
so
trifling
that
if
he
be
not
accustomed
to
contemplate
the
wonders
of
human
imagination
he
will
marvel
that
one
century
has
gained
for
it
so
much
pomp
and
reverence
the
art
of
opposition
and
of
revolution
is
to
unsettle
established
customs
sounding
them
even
to
their
source
to
point
out
their
want
of
authority
and
justice
we
must
it
is
said
get
back
to
the
natural
and
fundamental
laws
of
the
state
which
an
unjust
custom
has
abolished
it
is
a
game
certain
to
result
in
the
loss
of
all
nothing
will
be
just
on
the
balance
yet
people
readily
lend
their
ear
to
such
arguments
they
shake
off
the
yoke
as
soon
as
they
recognise
it
and
the
great
profit
by
their
ruin
and
by
that
of
these
curious
investigators
of
accepted
customs
but
from
a
contrary
mistake
men
sometimes
think
they
can
justly
do
everything
which
is
not
without
an
example
that
is
why
the
wisest
of
legislators
said
that
it
was
necessary
to
deceive
men
for
their
own
good
and
another

conformity
to
the
customs
of
a
country
as
the
rule
of
justice
it
is
here
that
not
finding
justice
we
have
found
force
etc
it
is
right
that
what
is
just
should
be
obeyed
it
is
necessary
that
what
is
strongest
should
be
obeyed
justice
without
might
is
helpless
might
without
justice
is
tyrannical
justice
without
might
is
gainsaid
because
there
are
always
offenders
might
without
justice
is
condemned
we
must
then
combine
justice
and
might
and
for
this
end
make
what
is
just
strong
or
what
is
strong
just
justice
is
subject
to
dispute
might
is
easily
recognised
and
is
not
disputed
so
we
can
not
give
might
to
justice
because
might
has
gainsaid
justice
and
has
declared
that
it
is
she
herself
who
is
just
and
thus
being
unable
to
make
what
is
just
strong
we
have
made
what
is
strong
just
the
only
universal
rules
are
the
laws
of
the
country
in
ordinary
affairs
and
of
the
majority
in
others
whence
comes
this
from
the
might
which
is
in
them
hence
it
comes
that
kings
who
have
power
of
a
different
kind
do
not
follow
the
majority
of
their
ministers
no
doubt
equality
of
goods
is
just
but
being
unable
to
cause
might
to
obey
justice
men
have
made
it
just
to
obey
might
unable
to
strengthen
justice
they
have
justified
might
so
that
the
just
and
the
strong
should
unite
and
there
should
be
peace
which
is
the
sovereign
good
when
a
strong
man
armed
keepeth
his
goods
his
goods
are
in
peace
why
do
we
follow
the
majority
it
is
because
they
have
more
reason
no
because
they
have
more
power
why
do
we
follow
the
ancient
laws
and
opinions
is
it
because
they
are
more
sound
no
but
because
they
are
unique
and
remove
from
us
the
root
of
difference
it
is
the
effect
of
might
not
of
custom
for
those
who
are
capable
of
originality
are
few
the
greater
number
will
only
follow
and
refuse
glory
to
those
inventors
who
seek
it
by
their
inventions
and
if
these
are
obstinate
in
their
wish
to
obtain
glory
and
despise
those
who
do
not
invent
the
latter
will
call
them
ridiculous
names
and
would
beat
them
with
a
stick
let
no
one
then
boast
of
his
subtlety
or
let
him
keep
his
complacency
to
himself
might
is
the
sovereign
of
the
world
and
not
but
opinion
makes
use
of
it
is
might
that
makes
opinion
gentleness
is
beautiful
in
our
opinion
why
because
he
who
will
dance
on
a
rope
will
be
alone
and
i
will
gather
a
stronger
mob
of
people
who
will
say
that
it
is
unbecoming
the
cords
which
bind
the
respect
of
men
to
each
other
are
in
general
cords
of
necessity
for
there
must
be
different
degrees
all
men
wishing
to
rule
and
not
all
being
able
to
do
so
but
some
being
able
let
us
then
imagine
we
see
society
in
the
process
of
formation
men
will
doubtless
fight
till
the
stronger
party
overcomes
the
weaker
and
a
dominant
party
is
established
but
when
this
is
once
determined
the
masters
who
do
not
desire
the
continuation
of
strife
then
decree
that
the
power
which
is
in
their
hands
shall
be
transmitted
as
they
please
some
place
it
in
election
by
the
people
others
in
hereditary
succession
etc
and
this
is
the
point
where
imagination
begins
to
play
its
part
till
now
power
makes
fact
now
power
is
sustained
by
imagination
in
a
certain
party
in
france
in
the
nobility
in
switzerland
in
the
burgesses
etc
these
cords
which
bind
the
respect
of
men
to
such
and
such
an
individual
are
therefore
the
cords
of
imagination
the
swiss
are
offended
by
being
called
gentlemen
and
prove
themselves
true
plebeians
in
order
to
be
thought
worthy
of
great
office
as
duchies
kingships
and
magistracies
are
real
and
necessary
because
might
rules
all
they
exist
everywhere
and
always
but
since
only
caprice
makes
such
and
such
a
one
a
ruler
the
principle
is
not
constant
but
subject
to
variation
etc
the
chancellor
is
grave
and
clothed
with
ornaments
for
his
position
is
unreal
not
so
the
king
he
has
power
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
imagination
judges
physicians
etc
appeal
only
to
the
imagination
the
habit
of
seeing
kings
accompanied
by
guards
drums
officers
and
all
the
paraphernalia
which
mechanically
inspire
respect
and
awe
makes
their
countenance
when
sometimes
seen
alone
without
these
accompaniments
impress
respect
and
awe
on
their
subjects
because
we
can
not
separate
in
thought
their
persons
from
the
surroundings
with
which
we
see
them
usually
joined
and
the
world
which
knows
not
that
this
effect
is
the
result
of
habit
believes
that
it
arises
by
a
natural
force
whence
come
these
words
the
character
of
divinity
is
stamped
on
his
countenance
etc
as
custom
determines
what
is
agreeable
so
also
does
it
determine
justice
and
i
too
will
keep
my
thoughts
secret
i
will
take
care
on
every
journey
greatness
of
establishment
respect
for
establishment
the
pleasure
of
the
great
is
the
power
to
make
people
happy
the
property
of
riches
is
to
be
given
liberally
the
property
of
each
thing
must
be
sought
the
property
of
power
is
to
protect
when
force
attacks
humbug
when
a
private
soldier
takes
the
square
cap
off
a
first
president
and
throws
it
out
of
the
window
the
government
founded
on
opinion
and
imagination
reigns
for
some
time
and
this
government
is
pleasant
and
voluntary
that
founded
on
might
lasts
for
ever
thus
opinion
is
the
queen
of
the
world
but
might
is
its
tyrant
justice
is
what
is
established
and
thus
all
our
established
laws
will
necessarily
be
regarded
as
just
without
examination
since
they
are
established
opinions
of
the
civil
wars
are
the
greatest
of
evils
they
are
inevitable
if
we
wish
to
reward
desert
for
all
will
say
they
are
deserving
the
evil
we
have
to
fear
from
a
fool
who
succeeds
by
right
of
birth
is
neither
so
great
nor
so
sure
god
has
created
all
for
himself
he
has
bestowed
upon
himself
the
power
of
pain
and
pleasure
you
can
apply
it
to
god
or
to
yourself
if
to
god
the
gospel
is
the
rule
if
to
yourself
you
will
take
the
place
of
god
as
god
is
surrounded
by
persons
full
of
charity
who
ask
of
him
the
blessings
of
charity
that
are
in
his
power
so
recognise
then
and
learn
that
you
are
only
a
king
of
lust
and
take
the
ways
of
lust
reason
of
it
is
wonderful
that
men
would
not
have
me
honour
a
man
clothed
in
brocade
and
followed
by
seven
or
eight
lackeys
why
he
will
have
me
thrashed
if
i
do
not
salute
him
this
custom
is
a
force
it
is
the
same
with
a
horse
in
fine
trappings
in
comparison
with
another
montaigne
is
a
fool
not
to
see
what
difference
there
is
to
wonder
at
our
finding
any
and
to
ask
the
reason
indeed
says
he
how
comes
it
etc
opinions
of
the
to
be
spruce
is
not
altogether
foolish
for
it
proves
that
a
great
number
of
people
work
for
one
it
shows
by
one
hair
that
one
has
a
valet
a
perfumer
by
one
band
thread
lace
etc
now
it
is
not
merely
superficial
nor
merely
outward
show
to
have
many
arms
at
command
the
more
arms
one
has
the
more
powerful
one
is
to
be
spruce
is
to
show
one
power
deference
means
put
yourself
to
inconvenience
this
is
apparently
silly
but
is
quite
right
for
it
is
to
say
i
would
indeed
put
myself
to
inconvenience
if
you
required
it
since
indeed
i
do
so
when
it
is
of
no
service
to
you
deference
further
serves
to
distinguish
the
great
now
if
deference
was
displayed
by
sitting
in
an
we
should
show
deference
to
everybody
and
so
no
distinction
would
be
made
but
being
put
to
inconvenience
we
distinguish
very
well
he
has
four
lackeys
how
rightly
do
we
distinguish
men
by
external
appearances
rather
than
by
internal
qualities
which
of
us
two
shall
have
precedence
who
will
give
place
to
the
other
the
least
clever
but
i
am
as
clever
as
he
we
should
have
to
fight
over
this
he
has
four
lackeys
and
i
have
only
one
this
can
be
seen
we
have
only
to
count
it
falls
to
me
to
yield
and
i
am
a
fool
if
i
contest
the
matter
by
this
means
we
are
at
peace
which
is
the
greatest
of
boons
the
most
unreasonable
things
in
the
world
become
most
reasonable
because
of
the
unruliness
of
men
what
is
less
reasonable
than
to
choose
the
eldest
son
of
a
queen
to
rule
a
state
we
do
not
choose
as
captain
of
a
ship
the
passenger
who
is
of
the
best
family
this
law
would
be
absurd
and
unjust
but
because
men
are
so
themselves
and
always
will
be
so
it
becomes
reasonable
and
just
for
whom
will
men
choose
as
the
most
virtuous
and
able
we
at
once
come
to
blows
as
each
claims
to
be
the
most
virtuous
and
able
let
us
then
attach
this
quality
to
something
indisputable
this
is
the
king
eldest
son
that
is
clear
and
there
is
no
dispute
reason
can
do
no
better
for
civil
war
is
the
greatest
of
evils
children
are
astonished
to
see
their
comrades
respected
to
be
of
noble
birth
is
a
great
advantage
in
eighteen
years
it
places
a
man
within
the
select
circle
known
and
respected
as
another
would
have
merited
in
fifty
years
it
is
a
gain
of
thirty
years
without
trouble
what
is
the
ego
suppose
a
man
puts
himself
at
a
window
to
see
those
who
pass
by
if
i
pass
by
can
i
say
that
he
placed
himself
there
to
see
me
no
for
he
does
not
think
of
me
in
particular
but
does
he
who
loves
someone
on
account
of
beauty
really
love
that
person
no
for
the
which
will
kill
beauty
without
killing
the
person
will
cause
him
to
love
her
no
more
and
if
one
loves
me
for
my
judgment
memory
he
does
not
love
for
i
can
lose
these
qualities
without
losing
myself
where
then
is
this
ego
if
it
be
neither
in
the
body
nor
in
the
soul
and
how
love
the
body
or
the
soul
except
for
these
qualities
which
do
not
constitute
since
they
are
perishable
for
it
is
impossible
and
would
be
unjust
to
love
the
soul
of
a
person
in
the
abstract
and
whatever
qualities
might
be
therein
we
never
then
love
a
person
but
only
qualities
let
us
then
jeer
no
more
at
those
who
are
honoured
on
account
of
rank
and
office
for
we
love
a
person
only
on
account
of
borrowed
qualities
the
people
have
very
sound
opinions
for
example
in
having
preferred
diversion
and
hunting
to
poetry
the
laugh
at
it
and
glory
in
being
above
the
folly
of
the
world
but
the
people
are
right
for
a
reason
which
these
do
not
fathom
in
having
distinguished
men
by
external
marks
as
birth
or
wealth
the
world
again
exults
in
showing
how
unreasonable
this
is
but
it
is
very
reasonable
savages
laugh
at
an
infant
king
in
being
offended
at
a
blow
on
in
desiring
glory
so
much
but
it
is
very
desirable
on
account
of
the
other
essential
goods
which
are
joined
to
it
and
a
man
who
has
received
a
blow
without
resenting
it
is
overwhelmed
with
taunts
and
indignities
in
working
for
the
uncertain
in
sailing
on
the
sea
in
walking
over
a
plank
montaigne
is
wrong
custom
should
be
followed
only
because
it
is
custom
and
not
because
it
is
reasonable
or
just
but
people
follow
it
for
this
sole
reason
that
they
think
it
just
otherwise
they
would
follow
it
no
longer
although
it
were
the
custom
for
they
will
only
submit
to
reason
or
justice
custom
without
this
would
pass
for
tyranny
but
the
sovereignty
of
reason
and
justice
is
no
more
tyrannical
than
that
of
desire
they
are
principles
natural
to
man
it
would
therefore
be
right
to
obey
laws
and
customs
because
they
are
laws
but
we
should
know
that
there
is
neither
truth
nor
justice
to
introduce
into
them
that
we
know
nothing
of
these
and
so
must
follow
what
is
accepted
by
this
means
we
would
never
depart
from
them
but
people
can
not
accept
this
doctrine
and
as
they
believe
that
truth
can
be
found
and
that
it
exists
in
law
and
custom
they
believe
them
and
take
their
antiquity
as
a
proof
of
their
truth
and
not
simply
of
their
authority
apart
from
truth
thus
they
obey
laws
but
they
are
liable
to
revolt
when
these
are
proved
to
be
valueless
and
this
can
be
shown
of
all
looked
at
from
a
certain
aspect
it
is
dangerous
to
tell
the
people
that
the
laws
are
unjust
for
they
obey
them
only
because
they
think
them
just
therefore
it
is
necessary
to
tell
them
at
the
same
time
that
they
must
obey
them
because
they
are
laws
just
as
they
must
obey
superiors
not
because
they
are
just
but
because
they
are
superiors
in
this
way
all
sedition
is
prevented
if
this
can
be
made
intelligible
and
it
be
understood
what
is
the
proper
definition
of
justice
the
world
is
a
good
judge
of
things
for
it
is
in
natural
ignorance
which
is
man
true
state
the
sciences
have
two
extremes
which
meet
the
first
is
the
pure
natural
ignorance
in
which
all
men
find
themselves
at
birth
the
other
extreme
is
that
reached
by
great
intellects
who
having
run
through
all
that
men
can
know
find
they
know
nothing
and
come
back
again
to
that
same
ignorance
from
which
they
set
out
but
this
is
a
learned
ignorance
which
is
conscious
of
itself
those
between
the
two
who
have
departed
from
natural
ignorance
and
not
been
able
to
reach
the
other
have
some
smattering
of
this
vain
knowledge
and
pretend
to
be
wise
these
trouble
the
world
and
are
bad
judges
of
everything
the
people
and
the
wise
constitute
the
world
these
despise
it
and
are
despised
they
judge
badly
of
everything
and
the
world
judges
rightly
of
them
reason
of
continual
alternation
of
pro
and
con
we
have
then
shown
that
man
is
foolish
by
the
estimation
he
makes
of
things
which
are
not
essential
and
all
these
opinions
are
destroyed
we
have
next
shown
that
all
these
opinions
are
very
sound
and
that
thus
since
all
these
vanities
are
well
founded
the
people
are
not
so
foolish
as
is
said
and
so
we
have
destroyed
the
opinion
which
destroyed
that
of
the
people
but
we
must
now
destroy
this
last
proposition
and
show
that
it
remains
always
true
that
the
people
are
foolish
though
their
opinions
are
sound
because
they
do
not
perceive
the
truth
where
it
is
and
as
they
place
it
where
it
is
not
their
opinions
are
always
very
false
and
very
unsound
reason
of
the
weakness
of
man
is
the
reason
why
so
many
things
are
considered
fine
as
to
be
good
at
playing
the
lute
it
is
only
an
evil
because
of
our
weakness
the
power
of
kings
is
founded
on
the
reason
and
on
the
folly
of
the
people
and
specially
on
their
folly
the
greatest
and
most
important
thing
in
the
world
has
weakness
for
its
foundation
and
this
foundation
is
wonderfully
sure
for
there
is
nothing
more
sure
than
this
that
the
people
will
be
weak
what
is
based
on
sound
reason
is
very
ill
founded
as
the
estimate
of
wisdom
we
can
only
think
of
plato
and
aristotle
in
grand
academic
robes
they
were
honest
men
like
others
laughing
with
their
friends
and
when
they
diverted
themselves
with
writing
their
and
the
they
did
it
as
an
amusement
that
part
of
their
life
was
the
least
philosophic
and
the
least
serious
the
most
philosophic
was
to
live
simply
and
quietly
if
they
wrote
on
politics
it
was
as
if
laying
down
rules
for
a
lunatic
asylum
and
if
they
presented
the
appearance
of
speaking
of
a
great
matter
it
was
because
they
knew
that
the
madmen
to
whom
they
spoke
thought
they
were
kings
and
emperors
they
entered
into
their
principles
in
order
to
make
their
madness
as
little
harmful
as
possible
tyranny
consists
in
the
desire
of
universal
power
beyond
its
scope
there
are
different
assemblies
of
the
strong
the
fair
the
sensible
the
pious
in
which
each
man
rules
at
home
not
elsewhere
and
sometimes
they
meet
and
the
strong
and
the
fair
foolishly
fight
as
to
who
shall
be
master
for
their
mastery
is
of
different
kinds
they
do
not
understand
one
another
and
their
fault
is
the
desire
to
rule
everywhere
nothing
can
effect
this
not
even
might
which
is
of
no
use
in
the
kingdom
of
the
wise
and
is
only
mistress
of
external
actions
so
these
expressions
are
false
and
tyrannical
i
am
fair
therefore
i
must
be
feared
i
am
strong
therefore
i
must
be
loved
i
am
tyranny
is
the
wish
to
have
in
one
way
what
can
only
be
had
in
another
we
render
different
duties
to
different
merits
the
duty
of
love
to
the
pleasant
the
duty
of
fear
to
the
strong
the
duty
of
belief
to
the
learned
we
must
render
these
duties
it
is
unjust
to
refuse
them
and
unjust
to
ask
others
and
so
it
is
false
and
tyrannical
to
say
he
is
not
strong
therefore
i
will
not
esteem
him
he
is
not
able
therefore
i
will
not
fear
him
have
you
never
seen
people
who
in
order
to
complain
of
the
little
fuss
you
make
about
them
parade
before
you
the
example
of
great
men
who
esteem
them
in
answer
i
reply
to
them
show
me
the
merit
whereby
you
have
charmed
these
persons
and
i
also
will
esteem
you
reason
of
lust
and
force
are
the
source
of
all
our
actions
lust
causes
voluntary
actions
force
involuntary
ones
reason
of
it
is
then
true
to
say
that
all
the
world
is
under
a
delusion
for
although
the
opinions
of
the
people
are
sound
they
are
not
so
as
conceived
by
them
since
they
think
the
truth
to
be
where
it
is
not
truth
is
indeed
in
their
opinions
but
not
at
the
point
where
they
imagine
it
thus
it
is
true
that
we
must
honour
noblemen
but
not
because
noble
birth
is
real
superiority
etc
reason
of
we
must
keep
our
thought
secret
and
judge
everything
by
it
while
talking
like
the
people
reason
of
degrees
the
people
honour
persons
of
high
birth
the
despise
them
saying
that
birth
is
not
a
personal
but
a
chance
superiority
the
learned
honour
them
not
for
popular
reasons
but
for
secret
reasons
devout
persons
who
have
more
zeal
than
knowledge
despise
them
in
spite
of
that
consideration
which
makes
them
honoured
by
the
learned
because
they
judge
them
by
a
new
light
which
piety
gives
them
but
perfect
christians
honour
them
by
another
and
higher
light
so
arise
a
succession
of
opinions
for
and
against
according
to
the
light
one
has
true
christians
nevertheless
comply
with
folly
not
because
they
respect
folly
but
the
command
of
god
who
for
the
punishment
of
men
has
made
them
subject
to
these
follies
creatura
subjecta
est
vanitati
thus
saint
thomas
explains
the
passage
in
saint
james
on
giving
place
to
the
rich
that
if
they
do
it
not
in
the
sight
of
god
they
depart

vi
the
philosophers
i
can
well
conceive
a
man
without
hands
feet
head
for
it
is
only
experience
which
teaches
us
that
the
head
is
more
necessary
than
feet
but
i
can
not
conceive
man
without
thought
he
would
be
a
stone
or
a
brute
the
arithmetical
machine
produces
effects
which
approach
nearer
to
thought
than
all
the
actions
of
animals
but
it
does
nothing
which
would
enable
us
to
attribute
will
to
it
as
to
the
animals
the
account
of
the
pike
and
frog
of
liancourt
they
do
it
always
and
never
otherwise
nor
any
other
thing
showing
mind
if
an
animal
did
by
mind
what
it
does
by
instinct
and
if
it
spoke
by
mind
what
it
speaks
by
instinct
in
hunting
and
in
warning
its
mates
that
the
prey
is
found
or
lost
it
would
indeed
also
speak

those
things

although
it
is
clean
instinct
and

marks
of
two
natures
reason
commands
us
far
more
imperiously
than
a

disobeying
the
one
we
are
unfortunate
and
in
disobeying
the
other
we
are
fools
thought
constitutes
the
greatness
of
man
man
is
but
a
reed
the
most
feeble
thing
in
nature
but
he
is
a
thinking
reed
the
entire
universe
need
not
arm
itself
to
crush
him
a
vapour
a
drop
of
water
suffices
to
kill
him
but
if
the
universe
were
to
crush
him
man
would
still
be
more
noble
than
that
which
killed
him
because
he
knows
that
he
dies
and
the
advantage
which
the
universe
has
over
him
the
universe
knows
nothing
of
this
all
our
dignity
consists
then
in
thought
by
it
we
must
elevate
ourselves
and
not
by
space
and
time
which
we
can
not
fill
let
us
endeavour
then
to
think
well
this
is
the
principle
of
morality
thinking
it
is
not
from
space
that
i
must
seek
my
dignity
but
from
the
government
of
my
thought
i
shall
have
no
more
if
i
possess
worlds
by
space
the
universe
encompasses
and
swallows
me
up
like
an
atom
by
thought
i
comprehend
the
world
of
the
philosophers
who
have
mastered
their
passions
what
matter
could
do
that
they
conclude
that
what
has
been
done
once
can
be
done
always
and
that
since
the
desire
of
glory
imparts
some
power
to
those
whom
it
possesses
others
can
do
likewise
there
are
feverish
movements
which
health
can
not
imitate
epictetus
concludes
that
since
there
are
consistent
christians
every
man
can
easily
be
so
those
great
spiritual
efforts
which
the
soul
sometimes
assays
are
things
on
which
it
does
not
lay
hold
it
only
leaps
to
them
not
as
upon
a
throne
for
ever
but
merely
for
an
instant
the
strength
of
a
man
virtue
must
not
be
measured
by
his
efforts
but
by
his
ordinary
life
i
do
not
admire
the
excess
of
a
virtue
as
of
valour
except
i
see
at
the
same
time
the
excess
of
the
opposite
virtue
as
in
epaminondas
who
had
the
greatest
valour
and
the
greatest
kindness
for
otherwise
it
is
not
to
rise
it
is
to
fall
we
do
not
display
greatness
by
going
to
one
extreme
but
in
touching
both
at
once
and
filling
all
the
intervening
space
but
perhaps
this
is
only
a
sudden
movement
of
the
soul
from
one
to
the
other
extreme
and
in
fact
it
is
ever
at
one
point
only
as
in
the
case
of
a
firebrand
be
it
so
but
at
least
this
indicates
agility
if
not
expanse
of
soul
man
nature
is
not
always
to
advance
it
has
its
advances
and
retreats
fever
has
its
cold
and
hot
fits
and
the
cold
proves
as
well
as
the
hot
the
greatness
of
the
fire
of
fever
the
discoveries
of
men
from
age
to
age
turn
out
the

the

and
the
malice
of
the

the

is
little

little
fullness
of

we
would
pursue
virtues
to
their
extremes
on
either
side

present
themselves
which
insinuate
themselves
insensibly
there
in
their
insensible
journey
towards
the
infinitely
little

present
themselves
in
a
crowd
towards
the
infinitely
great
so
that
we
lose
ourselves
in
them
and
no

see

we
find
fault
with
perfection

man
is
neither
angel
nor
brute
and
the
unfortunate
thing
is
that
he
who
would
act
the
angel
acts
the
brute
we
do
not
sustain
ourselves
in
virtue
by
our
own
strength

by
the
balancing
of
two
opposed
vices
just
as
we

upright

of

only
the

a
thought
has
escaped
me
i
wanted
to
write
it
down
i
write
instead
that
it
has
escaped
me
when
i
was
small
i
hugged
my
book
and
because
it
sometimes
happened
to
me
to
in
believing
i
hugged
it
i
doubted
in
writing
down
my
thought
it
sometimes
escapes
me
but
this
makes
me
remember
my
weakness
that
i
constantly
forget
this
is
as
instructive
to
me
as
my
forgotten
thought
for
i
strive
only
to
know
my
nothingness
i
shall
here
write
my
thoughts
without
order
and
not
perhaps
in
unintentional
confusion
that
is
true
order
which
will
always
indicate
my
object
by
its
very
disorder
i
should
do
too
much
honour
to
my
subject
if
i
treated
it
with
order
since
i
want
to
show
that
it
is
incapable
of
it
what
astonishes
me
most
is
to
see
that
all
the
world
is
not
astonished
at
its
own
weakness
men
act
seriously
and
each
follows
his
own
mode
of
life
not
because
it
is
in
fact
good
to
follow
since
it
is
the
custom
but
as
if
each
man
knew
certainly
where
reason
and
justice
are
they
find
themselves
continually
deceived
and
by
a
comical
humility
think
it
is
their
own
fault
and
not
that
of
the
art
which
they
claim
always
to
possess
but
it
is
well
there
are
so
many
such
people
in
the
world
who
are
not
sceptics
for
the
glory
of
scepticism
in
order
to
show
that
man
is
quite
capable
of
the
most
extravagant
opinions
since
he
is
capable
of
believing
that
he
is
not
in
a
state
of
natural
and
inevitable
weakness
but
on
the
contrary
of
natural
wisdom
nothing
fortifies
scepticism
more
than
that
there
are
some
who
are
not
sceptics
if
all
were
so
they
would
be
wrong
i
have
passed
a
great
part
of
my
life
believing
that
there
was
justice
and
in
this
i
was
not
mistaken
for
there
is
justice
according
as
god
has
willed
to
reveal
it
to
us
but
i
did
not
take
it
so
and
this
is
where
i
made
a
mistake
for
i
believed
that
our
justice
was
essentially
just
and
that
i
had
that
whereby
to
know
and
judge
of
it
but
i
have
so
often
found
my
right
judgment
at
fault
that
at
last
i
have
come
to
distrust
myself
and
then
others
i
have
seen
changes
in
all
nations
and
men
and
thus
after
many
changes
of
judgment
regarding
true
justice
i
have
recognised
that
our
nature
was
but
in
continual
change
and
i
have
not
changed
since
and
if
i
changed
i
would
confirm
my
opinion
the
sceptic
arcesilaus
who
became
a
dogmatist
this
sect
derives
more
strength
from
its
enemies
than
from
its
friends
for
the
weakness
of
man
is
far
more
evident
in
those
who
know
it
not
than
in
those
who
know
it
discourses
on
humility
are
a
source
of
pride
in
the
vain
and
of
humility
in
the
humble
so
those
on
scepticism
cause
believers
to
affirm
few
men
speak
humbly
of
humility
chastely
of
chastity
few
doubtingly
of
scepticism
we
are
only
falsehood
duplicity
contradiction
we
both
conceal
and
disguise
ourselves
from
ourselves
excess
like
defect
of
intellect
is
accused
of
madness
nothing
is
good
but
mediocrity
the
majority
has
settled
that
and
finds
fault
with
him
who
escapes
it
at
whichever
end
i
will
not
oppose
it
i
quite
consent
to
put
myself
there
and
refuse
to
be
at
the
lower
end
not
because
it
is
low
but
because
it
is
an
end
for
i
would
likewise
refuse
to
be
placed
at
the
top
to
leave
the
mean
is
to
abandon
humanity
the
greatness
of
the
human
soul
consists
in
knowing
how
to
preserve
the
mean
so
far
from
greatness
consisting
in
leaving
it
it
consists
in
not
leaving
it
it
is
not
good
to
have
too
much
liberty
it
is
not
good
to
have
all
one
wants
all
good
maxims
are
in
the
world
we
only
need
to
apply
them
for
instance
we
do
not
doubt
that
we
ought
to
risk
our
lives
in
defence
of
the
public
good
but
for
religion
no
it
is
true
there
must
be
inequality
among
men
but
if
this
be
conceded
the
door
is
opened
not
only
to
the
highest
power
but
to
the
highest
tyranny
we
must
relax
our
minds
a
little
but
this
opens
the
door
to
the
greatest
debauchery
let
us
mark
the
limits
there
are
no
limits
in
things
laws
would
put
them
there
and
the
mind
can
not
suffer
it
when
we
are
too
young
we
do
not
judge
well
so
also
when
we
are
too
old
if
we
do
not
think
enough
or
if
we
think
too
much
on
any
matter
we
get
obstinate
and
infatuated
about
it
if
one
considers
one
work
immediately
after
having
done
it
one
is
entirely
prepossessed
in
its
favour
by
delaying
too
long
one
can
no
longer
enter
into
the
spirit
of
it
so
with
pictures
seen
from
too
far
or
too
near
there
is
but
one
exact
point
which
is
the
true
place
wherefrom
to
look
at
them
the
rest
are
too
near
too
far
too
high
or
too
low
perspective
determines
that
point
in
the
art
of
painting
but
who
shall
determine
it
in
truth
and
morality
when
all
is
equally
agitated
nothing
appears
to
be
agitated
as
in
a
ship
when
all
tend
to
debauchery
none
appears
to
do
so
he
who
stops
draws
attention
to
the
excess
of
others
like
a
fixed
point
the
licentious
tell
men
of
orderly
lives
that
they
stray
from
path
while
they
themselves
follow
it
as
people
in
a
ship
think
those
move
who
are
on
the
shore
on
all
sides
the
language
is
similar
we
must
have
a
fixed
point
in
order
to
judge
the
harbour
decides
for
those
who
are
in
a
ship
but
where
shall
we
find
a
harbour
in
morality
contradiction
is
a
bad
sign
of
truth
several
things
which
are
certain
are
contradicted
several
things
which
are
false
pass
without
contradiction
contradiction
is
not
a
sign
of
falsity
nor
the
want
of
contradiction
a
sign
of
truth
each
thing
here
is
partly
true
and
partly
false
essential
truth
is
not
so
it
is
altogether
pure
and
altogether
true
this
mixture
dishonours
and
annihilates
it
nothing
is
purely
true
and
thus
nothing
is
true
meaning
by
that
pure
truth
you
will
say
it
is
true
that
homicide
is
wrong
yes
for
we
know
well
the
wrong
and
the
false
but
what
will
you
say
is
good
chastity
i
say
no
for
the
world
would
come
to
an
end
marriage
no
continence
is
better
not
to
kill
no
for
lawlessness
would
be
horrible
and
the
wicked
would
kill
all
the
good
to
kill
no
for
that
destroys
nature
we
possess
truth
and
goodness
only
in
part
and
mingled
with
falsehood
and
evil
if
we
dreamt
the
same
thing
every
night
it
would
affect
us
as
much
as
the
objects
we
see
every
day
and
if
an
artisan
were
sure
to
dream
every
night
for
twelve
hours
duration
that
he
was
a
king
i
believe
he
would
be
almost
as
happy
as
a
king
who
should
dream
every
night
for
twelve
hours
on
end
that
he
was
an
artisan
if
we
were
to
dream
every
night
that
we
were
pursued
by
enemies
and
harassed
by
these
painful
phantoms
or
that
we
passed
every
day
in
different
occupations
as
in
making
a
voyage
we
should
suffer
almost
as
much
as
if
it
were
real
and
should
fear
to
sleep
as
we
fear
to
wake
when
we
dread
in
fact
to
enter
on
such
mishaps
and
indeed
it
would
cause
pretty
nearly
the
same
discomforts
as
the
reality
but
since
dreams
are
all
different
and
each
single
one
is
diversified
what
is
seen
in
them
affects
us
much
less
than
what
we
see
when
awake
because
of
its
continuity
which
is
not
however
so
continuous
and
level
as
not
to
change
too
but
it
changes
less
abruptly
except
rarely
as
when
we
travel
and
then
we
say
it
seems
to
me
i
am
dreaming
for
life
is
a
dream
a
little
less
inconstant
it
may
be
that
there
are
true
demonstrations
but
this
is
not
certain
thus
this
proves
nothing
else
but
that
it
is
not
certain
that
all
is
uncertain
to
the
glory
of
scepticism
they
are
compelled
to
say
you
are
not
acting
in
good
faith
we
are
not
asleep
etc
how
i
love
to
see
this
proud
reason
humiliated
and
suppliant
for
this
is
not
the
language
of
a
man
whose
right
is
disputed
and
who
defends
it
with
the
power
of
armed
hands
he
is
not
foolish
enough
to
declare
that
men
are
not
acting
in
good
faith
but
he
punishes
this
bad
faith
with
force
ecclesiastes
shows
that
man
without
god
is
in
total
ignorance
and
inevitable
misery
for
it
is
wretched
to
have
the
wish
but
not
the
power
now
he
would
be
happy
and
assured
of
some
truth
and
yet
he
can
neither
know
nor
desire
not
to
know
he
can
not
even
doubt
my
god
how
foolish
this
talk
is
would
god
have
made
the
world
to
damn
it
would
he
ask
so
much
from
persons
so
weak
etc
scepticism
is
the
cure
for
this
evil
and
will
take
down
this
vanity
great
words
religion
i
deny
it
scepticism
helps
religion
it
is
then
a
strange
fact
that
we
can
not
define
these
things
without
obscuring
them
while
we
speak
of
them
with
all
assurance
we
assume
that
all
conceive
of
them
in
the
same
way
but
we
assume
it
quite
gratuitously
for
we
have
no
proof
of
it
i
see
in
truth
that
the
same
words
are
applied
on
the
same
occasions
and
that
every
time
two
men
see
a
body
change
its
place
they
both
express
their
view
of
this
same
fact
by
the
same
word
both
saying
that
it
has
moved
and
from
this
conformity
of
application
we
derive
a
strong
conviction
of
a
conformity
of
ideas
but
this
is
not
absolutely
or
finally
convincing
though
there
is
enough
to
support
a
bet
on
the
affirmative
since
we
know
that
we
often
draw
the
same
conclusions
from
different
premisses
this
is
enough
at
least
to
obscure
the
matter
not
that
it
completely
extinguishes
the
natural
light
which
assures
us
of
these
things
the
academicians
would
have
won
but
this
dulls
it
and
troubles
the
dogmatists
to
the
glory
of
the
sceptical
crowd
which
consists
in
this
doubtful
ambiguity
and
in
a
certain
doubtful
dimness
from
which
our
doubts
can
not
take
away
all
the
clearness
nor
our
own
natural
lights
chase
away
all
the
darkness
it
is
a
singular
thing
to
consider
that
there
are
people
in
the
world
who
having
renounced
all
the
laws
of
god
and
nature
have
made
laws
for
themselves
which
they
strictly
obey
as
for
instance
the
soldiers
of
mahomet
robbers
heretics
etc
it
is
the
same
with
logicians
it
seems
that
their
licence
must
be
without
any
limits
or
barriers
since
they
have
broken
through
so
many
that
are
so
just
and
sacred
all
the
principles
of
sceptics
stoics
atheists
are
true
but
their
conclusions
are
false
because
the
opposite
principles
are
also
true
we
have
an
incapacity
of
proof
insurmountable
by
all
dogmatism
we
have
an
idea
of
truth
invincible
to
all
scepticism
two
things
instruct
man
about
his
whole
nature
instinct
and
experience
the
greatness
of
man
is
great
in
that
he
knows
himself
to
be
miserable
a
tree
does
not
know
itself
to
be
miserable
it
is
then
being
miserable
to
know
oneself
to
be
miserable
but
it
is
also
being
great
to
know
that
one
is
miserable
all
these
same
miseries
prove
man
greatness
they
are
the
miseries
of
a
great
lord
of
a
deposed
king
we
are
not
miserable
without
feeling
it
a
ruined
house
is
not
miserable
man
only
is
miserable
vir
greatness
of
we
have
so
great
an
idea
of
the
soul
of
man
that
we
can
not
endure
being
despised
or
not
being
esteemed
by
any
soul
and
all
the
happiness
of
men
consists
in
this
esteem
the
brutes
do
not
admire
each
other
a
horse
does
not
admire
his
companion
not
that
there
is
no
rivalry
between
them
in
a
race
but
that
is
of
no
consequence
for
when
in
the
stable
the
heaviest
and
most
does
not
give
up
his
oats
to
another
as
men
would
have
others
do
to
them
their
virtue
is
satisfied
with
itself
the
greatness
of
man
even
in
his
lust
to
have
known
how
to
extract
from
it
a
wonderful
code
and
to
have
drawn
from
it
a
picture
of
benevolence
the
reasons
of
effects
indicate
the
greatness
of
man
in
having
extracted
so
fair
an
order
from
lust
the
greatest
baseness
of
man
is
the
pursuit
of
glory
but
it
is
also
the
greatest
mark
of
his
excellence
for
whatever
possessions
he
may
have
on
earth
whatever
health
and
essential
comfort
he
is
not
satisfied
if
he
has
not
the
esteem
of
men
he
values
human
reason
so
highly
that
whatever
advantages
he
may
have
on
earth
he
is
not
content
if
he
is
not
also
ranked
highly
in
the
judgment
of
man
this
is
the
finest
position
in
the
world
nothing
can
turn
him
from
that
desire
which
is
the
most
indelible
quality
of
man
heart
and
those
who
most
despise
men
and
put
them
on
a
level
with
the
brutes
yet
wish
to
be
admired
and
believed
by
men
and
contradict
themselves
by
their
own
feelings
their
nature
which
is
stronger
than
all
convincing
them
of
the
greatness
of
man
more
forcibly
than
reason
convinces
them
of
their
baseness
pride
counterbalancing
all
miseries
man
either
hides
his
miseries
or
if
he
disclose
them
glories
in
knowing
them
pride
counterbalances
and
takes
away
all
miseries
here
is
a
strange
monster
and
a
very
plain
aberration
he
is
fallen
from
his
place
and
is
anxiously
seeking
it
this
is
what
all
men
do
let
us
see
who
will
have
found
it
when
malice
has
reason
on
its
side
it
becomes
proud
and
parades
reason
in
all
its
splendour
when
austerity
or
stern
choice
has
not
arrived
at
the
true
good
and
must
needs
return
to
follow
nature
it
becomes
proud
by
reason
of
this
return
evil
is
easy
and
has
infinite
forms
good
is
almost
unique
but
a
certain
kind
of
evil
is
as
difficult
to
find
as
what
we
call
good
and
often
on
this
account
such
particular
evil
gets
passed
off
as
good
an
extraordinary
greatness
of
soul
is
needed
in
order
to
attain
to
it
as
well
as
to
good
greatness
of
the
greatness
of
man
is
so
evident
that
it
is
even
proved
by
his
wretchedness
for
what
in
animals
is
nature
we
call
in
man
wretchedness
by
which
we
recognise
that
his
nature
being
now
like
that
of
animals
he
has
fallen
from
a
better
nature
which
once
was
his
for
who
is
unhappy
at
not
being
a
king
except
a
deposed
king
was
paulus
æmilius
unhappy
at
being
no
longer
consul
on
the
contrary
everybody
thought
him
happy
in
having
been
consul
because
the
office
could
only
be
held
for
a
time
but
men
thought
perseus
so
unhappy
in
being
no
longer
king
because
the
condition
of
kingship
implied
his
being
always
king
that
they
thought
it
strange
that
he
endured
life
who
is
unhappy
at
having
only
one
mouth
and
who
is
not
unhappy
at
having
only
one
eye
probably
no
man
ever
ventured
to
mourn
at
not
having
three
eyes
but
any
one
is
inconsolable
at
having
none
king
of
paulus
æmilius
reproached
perseus
for
not
killing
himself
notwithstanding
the
sight
of
all
our
miseries
which
press
upon
us
and
take
us
by
the
throat
we
have
an
instinct
which
we
can
not
repress
and
which
lifts
us
up
there
is
internal
war
in
man
between
reason
and
the
passions
if
he
had
only
reason
without
passions
if
he
had
only
passions
without
reason
but
having
both
he
can
not
be
without
strife
being
unable
to
be
at
peace
with
the
one
without
being
at
war
with
the
other
thus
he
is
always
divided
against
and
opposed
to
himself
this
internal
war
of
reason
against
the
passions
has
made
a
division
of
those
who
would
have
peace
into
two
sects
the
first
would
renounce
their
passions
and
become
gods
the
others
would
renounce
reason
and
become
brute
beasts
des
barreaux
but
neither
can
do
so
and
reason
still
remains
to
condemn
the
vileness
and
injustice
of
the
passions
and
to
trouble
the
repose
of
those
who
abandon
themselves
to
them
and
the
passions
keep
always
alive
in
those
who
would
renounce
them
men
are
so
necessarily
mad
that
not
to
be
mad
would
amount
to
another
form
of
madness
the
nature
of
man
may
be
viewed
in
two
ways
the
one
according
to
its
end
and
then
he
is
great
and
incomparable
the
other
according
to
the
multitude
just
as
we
judge
of
the
nature
of
the
horse
and
the
dog
popularly
by
seeing
its
fleetness
animum
and
then
man
is
abject
and
vile
these
are
the
two
ways
which
make
us
judge
of
him
differently
and
which
occasion
such
disputes
among
philosophers
for
one
denies
the
assumption
of
the
other
one
says
he
is
not
born
for
this
end
for
all
his
actions
are
repugnant
to
it
the
other
says
he
forsakes
his
end
when
he
does
these
base
actions
greatness
and
wretchedness
being
deduced
from
greatness
and
greatness
from
wretchedness
some
have
inferred
man
wretchedness
all
the
more
because
they
have
taken
his
greatness
as
a
proof
of
it
and
others
have
inferred
his
greatness
with
all
the
more
force
because
they
have
inferred
it
from
his
very
wretchedness
all
that
the
one
party
has
been
able
to
say
in
proof
of
his
greatness
has
only
served
as
an
argument
of
his
wretchedness
to
the
others
because
the
greater
our
fall
the
more
wretched
we
are
and
the
one
party
is
brought
back
to
the
other
in
an
endless
circle
it
being
certain
that
in
proportion
as
men
possess
light
they
discover
both
the
greatness
and
the
wretchedness
of
man
in
a
word
man
knows
that
he
is
wretched
he
is
therefore
wretched
because
he
is
so
but
he
is
really
great
because
he
knows
it
this
twofold
nature
of
man
is
so
evident
that
some
have
thought
that
we
had
two
souls
a
single
subject
seemed
to
them
incapable
of
such
sudden
variations
from
unmeasured
presumption
to
a
dreadful
dejection
of
heart
it
is
dangerous
to
make
man
see
too
clearly
his
equality
with
the
brutes
without
showing
him
his
greatness
it
is
also
dangerous
to
make
him
see
his
greatness
too
clearly
apart
from
his
vileness
it
is
still
more
dangerous
to
leave
him
in
ignorance
of
both
but
it
is
very
advantageous
to
show
him
both
man
must
not
think
that
he
is
on
a
level
either
with
the
brutes
or
with
the
angels
nor
must
he
be
ignorant
of
both
sides
of
his
nature
but
he
must
know
both
i
will
not
allow
man
to
depend
upon
himself
or
upon
another
to
the
end
that
being
without
a
and
without
repose
if
he
exalt
himself
i
humble
him
if
he
humble
himself
i
exalt
him
and
i
always
contradict
him
till
he
understands
that
he
is
an
incomprehensible
monster
i
blame
equally
those
who
choose
to
praise
man
those
who
choose
to
blame
him
and
those
who
choose
to
amuse
themselves
and
i
can
only
approve
of
those
who
seek
with
lamentation
it
is
good
to
be
tired
and
wearied
by
the
vain
search
after
the
true
good
that
we
may
stretch
out
our
arms
to
the
redeemer
after
having
shown
the
vileness
and
the
greatness
of
let
man
now
know
his
value
let
him
love
himself
for
there
is
in
him
a
nature
capable
of
good
but
let
him
not
for
this
reason
love
the
vileness
which
is
in
him
let
him
despise
himself
for
this
capacity
is
barren
but
let
him
not
therefore
despise
this
natural
capacity
let
him
hate
himself
let
him
love
himself
he
has
within
him
the
capacity
of
knowing
the
truth
and
of
being
happy
but
he
possesses
no
truth
either
constant
or
satisfactory
i
would
then
lead
man
to
the
desire
of
finding
truth
to
be
free
from
passions
and
ready
to
follow
it
where
he
may
find
it
knowing
how
much
his
knowledge
is
obscured
by
the
passions
i
would
indeed
that
he
should
hate
in
himself
the
lust
which
determined
his
will
by
itself
so
that
it
may
not
blind
him
in
making
his
choice
and
may
not
hinder
him
when
he
has
chosen
all
these
contradictions
which
seem
most
to
keep
me
from
the
knowledge
of
religion
have
led
me
most
quickly
to
the
true
one
section
vii
morality
and
doctrine
that
man
without
faith
can
not
know
the
true
good
nor
all
men
seek
happiness
this
is
without
exception
whatever
different
means
they
employ
they
all
tend
to
this
end
the
cause
of
some
going
to
war
and
of
others
avoiding
it
is
the
same
desire
in
both
attended
with
different
views
the
will
never
takes
the
least
step
but
to
this
object
this
is
the
motive
of
every
action
of
every
man
even
of
those
who
hang
themselves
and
yet
after
such
a
great
number
of
years
no
one
without
faith
has
reached
the
point
to
which
all
continually
look
all
complain
princes
and
subjects
noblemen
and
commoners
old
and
young
strong
and
weak
learned
and
ignorant
healthy
and
sick
of
all
countries
all
times
all
ages
and
all
conditions
a
trial
so
long
so
continuous
and
so
uniform
should
certainly
convince
us
of
our
inability
to
reach
the
good
by
our
own
efforts
but
example
teaches
us
little
no
resemblance
is
ever
so
perfect
that
there
is
not
some
slight
difference
and
hence
we
expect
that
our
hope
will
not
be
deceived
on
this
occasion
as
before
and
thus
while
the
present
never
satisfies
us
experience
dupes
us
and
from
misfortune
to
misfortune
leads
us
to
death
their
eternal
crown
what
is
it
then
that
this
desire
and
this
inability
proclaim
to
us
but
that
there
was
once
in
man
a
true
happiness
of
which
there
now
remain
to
him
only
the
mark
and
empty
trace
which
he
in
vain
tries
to
fill
from
all
his
surroundings
seeking
from
things
absent
the
help
he
does
not
obtain
in
things
present
but
these
are
all
inadequate
because
the
infinite
abyss
can
only
be
filled
by
an
infinite
and
immutable
object
that
is
to
say
only
by
god
himself
he
only
is
our
true
good
and
since
we
have
forsaken
him
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
there
is
nothing
in
nature
which
has
not
been
serviceable
in
taking
his
place
the
stars
the
heavens
earth
the
elements
plants
cabbages
leeks
animals
insects
calves
serpents
fever
pestilence
war
famine
vices
adultery
incest
and
since
man
has
lost
the
true
good
everything
can
appear
equally
good
to
him
even
his
own
destruction
though
so
opposed
to
god
to
reason
and
to
the
whole
course
of
nature
some
seek
good
in
authority
others
in
scientific
research
others
in
pleasure
others
who
are
in
fact
nearer
the
truth
have
considered
it
necessary
that
the
universal
good
which
all
men
desire
should
not
consist
in
any
of
the
particular
things
which
can
only
be
possessed
by
one
man
and
which
when
shared
afflict
their
possessor
more
by
the
want
of
the
part
he
has
not
than
they
please
him
by
the
possession
of
what
he
has
they
have
learned
that
the
true
good
should
be
such
as
all
can
possess
at
once
without
diminution
and
without
envy
and
which
no
one
can
lose
against
his
will
and
their
reason
is
that
this
desire
being
natural
to
man
since
it
is
necessarily
in
all
and
that
it
is
impossible
not
to
have
it
they
infer
from
it
true
nature
being
lost
everything
becomes
its
own
nature
as
the
true
good
being
lost
everything
becomes
its
own
true
good
man
does
not
know
in
what
rank
to
place
himself
he
has
plainly
gone
astray
and
fallen
from
his
true
place
without
being
able
to
find
it
again
he
seeks
it
anxiously
and
unsuccessfully
everywhere
in
impenetrable
darkness
if
it
is
a
sign
of
weakness
to
prove
god
by
nature
do
not
despise
scripture
if
it
is
a
sign
of
strength
to
have
known
these
contradictions
esteem
scripture
the
vileness
of
man
in
submitting
himself
to
the
brutes
and
in
even
worshipping
them
port
royal
the
beginning
after
having
explained
the
the
greatness
and
the
wretchedness
of
man
are
so
evident
that
the
true
religion
must
necessarily
teach
us
both
that
there
is
in
man
some
great
source
of
greatness
and
a
great
source
of
wretchedness
it
must
then
give
us
a
reason
for
these
astonishing
contradictions
in
order
to
make
man
happy
it
must
prove
to
him
that
there
is
a
god
that
we
ought
to
love
him
that
our
true
happiness
is
to
be
in
him
and
our
sole
evil
to
be
separated
from
him
it
must
recognise
that
we
are
full
of
darkness
which
hinders
us
from
knowing
and
loving
him
and
that
thus
as
our
duties
compel
us
to
love
god
and
our
lusts
turn
us
away
from
him
we
are
full
of
unrighteousness
it
must
give
us
an
explanation
of
our
opposition
to
god
and
to
our
own
good
it
must
teach
us
the
remedies
for
these
infirmities
and
the
means
of
obtaining
these
remedies
let
us
therefore
examine
all
the
religions
of
the
world
and
see
if
there
be
any
other
than
the
christian
which
is
sufficient
for
this
purpose
shall
it
be
that
of
the
philosophers
who
put
forward
as
the
chief
good
the
good
which
is
in
ourselves
is
this
the
true
good
have
they
found
the
remedy
for
our
ills
is
man
pride
cured
by
placing
him
on
an
equality
with
god
have
those
who
have
made
us
equal
to
the
brutes
or
the
mahommedans
who
have
offered
us
earthly
pleasures
as
the
chief
good
even
in
eternity
produced
the
remedy
for
our
lusts
what
religion
then
will
teach
us
to
cure
pride
and
lust
what
religion
will
in
fact
teach
us
our
good
our
duties
the
weakness
which
turns
us
from
them
the
cause
of
this
weakness
the
remedies
which
can
cure
it
and
the
means
of
obtaining
these
remedies
all
other
religions
have
not
been
able
to
do
so
let
us
see
what
the
wisdom
of
god
will
do
expect
neither
truth
she
says
nor
consolation
from
men
i
am
she
who
formed
you
and
who
alone
can
teach
you
what
you
are
but
you
are
now
no
longer
in
the
state
in
which
i
formed
you
i
created
man
holy
innocent
perfect
i
filled
him
with
light
and
intelligence
i
communicated
to
him
my
glory
and
my
wonders
the
eye
of
man
saw
then
the
majesty
of
god
he
was
not
then
in
the
darkness
which
blinds
him
nor
subject
to
mortality
and
the
woes
which
afflict
him
but
he
has
not
been
able
to
sustain
so
great
glory
without
falling
into
pride
he
wanted
to
make
himself
his
own
centre
and
independent
of
my
help
he
withdrew
himself
from
my
rule
and
on
his
making
himself
equal
to
me
by
the
desire
of
finding
his
happiness
in
himself
i
abandoned
him
to
himself
and
setting
in
revolt
the
creatures
that
were
subject
to
him
i
made
them
his
enemies
so
that
man
is
now
become
like
the
brutes
and
so
estranged
from
me
that
there
scarce
remains
to
him
a
dim
vision
of
his
author
so
far
has
all
his
knowledge
been
extinguished
or
disturbed
the
senses
independent
of
reason
and
often
the
masters
of
reason
have
led
him
into
pursuit
of
pleasure
all
creatures
either
torment
or
tempt
him
and
domineer
over
him
either
subduing
him
by
their
strength
or
fascinating
him
by
their
charms
a
tyranny
more
awful
and
more
imperious
such
is
the
state
in
which
men
now
are
there
remains
to
them
some
feeble
instinct
of
the
happiness
of
their
former
state
and
they
are
plunged
in
the
evils
of
their
blindness
and
their
lust
which
have
become
their
second
nature
from
this
principle
which
i
disclose
to
you
you
can
recognise
the
cause
of
those
contradictions
which
have
astonished
all
men
and
have
divided
them
into
parties
holding
so
different
views
observe
now
all
the
feelings
of
greatness
and
glory
which
the
experience
of
so
many
woes
can
not
stifle
and
see
if
the
cause
of
them
must
not
be
in
another
nature
prosopopœa
it
is
in
vain
o
men
that
you
seek
within
yourselves
the
remedy
for
your
ills
all
your
light
can
only
reach
the
knowledge
that
not
in
yourselves
will
you
find
truth
or
good
the
philosophers
have
promised
you
that
and
have
been
unable
to
do
it
they
neither
know
what
is
your
true
good
nor
what
is
your
true
state
how
could
they
have
given
remedies
for
your
ills
when
they
did
not
even
know
them
your
chief
maladies
are
pride
which
takes
you
away
from
god
and
lust
which
binds
you
to
earth
and
they
have
done
nothing
else
but
cherish
one
or
other
of
these
diseases
if
they
gave
you
god
as
an
end
it
was
only
to
administer
to
your
pride
they
made
you
think
that
you
are
by
nature
like
him
and
conformed
to
him
and
those
who
saw
the
absurdity
of
this
claim
put
you
on
another
precipice
by
making
you
understand
that
your
nature
was
like
that
of
the
brutes
and
led
you
to
seek
your
good
in
the
lusts
which
are
shared
by
the
animals
this
is
not
the
way
to
cure
you
of
your
unrighteousness
which
these
wise
men
never
knew
i
alone
can
make
you
understand
who
you
are
adam
jesus
christ
if
you
are
united
to
god
it
is
by
grace
not
by
nature
if
you
are
humbled
it
is
by
penitence
not
by
nature
thus
this
double
capacity
you
are
not
in
the
state
of
your
creation
as
these
two
states
are
open
it
is
impossible
for
you
not
to
recognise
them
follow
your
own
feelings
observe
yourselves
and
see
if
you
do
not
find
the
lively
characteristics
of
these
two
natures
could
so
many
contradictions
be
found
in
a
simple
subject
not
all
that
is
incomprehensible
ceases
to
exist
infinite
number
an
infinite
space
equal
to
a
finite
incredible
that
god
should
unite
himself
to
this
consideration
is
drawn
only
from
the
sight
of
our
vileness
but
if
you
are
quite
sincere
over
it
follow
it
as
far
as
i
have
done
and
recognise
that
we
are
indeed
so
vile
that
we
are
incapable
in
ourselves
of
knowing
if
his
mercy
can
not
make
us
capable
of
him
for
i
would
know
how
this
animal
who
knows
himself
to
be
so
weak
has
the
right
to
measure
the
mercy
of
god
and
set
limits
to
it
suggested
by
his
own
fancy
he
has
so
little
knowledge
of
what
god
is
that
he
does
not
know
what
he
himself
is
and
completely
disturbed
at
the
sight
of
his
own
state
dares
to
say
that
god
can
not
make
him
capable
of
communion
with
him
but
i
would
ask
him
if
god
demands
anything
else
from
him
than
the
knowledge
and
love
of
him
and
why
since
his
nature
is
capable
of
love
and
knowledge
he
believes
that
god
can
not
make
himself
known
and
loved
by
him
doubtless
he
knows
at
least
that
he
exists
and
that
he
loves
something
therefore
if
he
sees
anything
in
the
darkness
wherein
he
is
and
if
he
finds
some
object
of
his
love
among
the
things
on
earth
why
if
god
impart
to
him
some
ray
of
his
essence
will
he
not
be
capable
of
knowing
and
of
loving
him
in
the
manner
in
which
it
shall
please
him
to
communicate
himself
to
us
there
must
then
be
certainly
an
intolerable
presumption
in
arguments
of
this
sort
although
they
seem
founded
on
an
apparent
humility
which
is
neither
sincere
nor
reasonable
if
it
does
not
make
us
admit
that
not
knowing
of
ourselves
what
we
are
we
can
only
learn
it
from
god
i
do
not
mean
that
you
should
submit
your
belief
to
me
without
reason
and
i
do
not
aspire
to
overcome
you
by
tyranny
in
fact
i
do
not
claim
to
give
you
a
reason
for
everything
and
to
reconcile
these
contradictions
i
intend
to
make
you
see
clearly
by
convincing
proofs
those
divine
signs
in
me
which
may
convince
you
of
what
i
am
and
may
gain
authority
for
me
by
wonders
and
proofs
which
you
can
not
reject
so
that
you
may
then
believe
without
the
things
which
i
teach
you
since
you
will
find
no
other
ground
for
rejecting
them
except
that
you
can
not
know
of
yourselves
if
they
are
true
or
not
god
has
willed
to
redeem
men
and
to
open
salvation
to
those
who
seek
it
but
men
render
themselves
so
unworthy
of
it
that
it
is
right
that
god
should
refuse
to
some
because
of
their
obduracy
what
he
grants
to
others
from
a
compassion
which
is
not
due
to
them
if
he
had
willed
to
overcome
the
obstinacy
of
the
most
hardened
he
could
have
done
so
by
revealing
himself
so
manifestly
to
them
that
they
could
not
have
doubted
of
the
truth
of
his
essence
as
it
will
appear
at
the
last
day
with
such
thunders
and
such
a
convulsion
of
nature
that
the
dead
will
rise
again
and
the
blindest
will
see
him
it
is
not
in
this
manner
that
he
has
willed
to
appear
in
his
advent
of
mercy
because
as
so
many
make
themselves
unworthy
of
his
mercy
he
has
willed
to
leave
them
in
the
loss
of
the
good
which
they
do
not
want
it
was
not
then
right
that
he
should
appear
in
a
manner
manifestly
divine
and
completely
capable
of
convincing
all
men
but
it
was
also
not
right
that
he
should
come
in
so
hidden
a
manner
that
he
could
not
be
known
by
those
who
should
sincerely
seek
him
he
has
willed
to
make
himself
quite
recognisable
by
those
and
thus
willing
to
appear
openly
to
those
who
seek
him
with
all
their
heart
and
to
be
hidden
from
those
who
flee
from
him
with
all
their
heart
he
so
regulates
the
knowledge
of
himself
that
he
has
given
signs
of
himself
visible
to
those
who
seek
him
and
not
to
those
who
seek
him
not
there
is
enough
light
for
those
who
only
desire
to
see
and
enough
obscurity
for
those
who
have
a
contrary
disposition
no
other
religion
has
recognised
that
man
is
the
most
excellent
creature
some
which
have
quite
recognised
the
reality
of
his
excellence
have
considered
as
mean
and
ungrateful
the
low
opinions
which
men
naturally
have
of
themselves
and
others
which
have
thoroughly
recognised
how
real
is
this
vileness
have
treated
with
proud
ridicule
those
feelings
of
greatness
which
are
equally
natural
to
man
lift
your
eyes
to
god
say
the
first
see
him
whom
you
resemble
and
who
has
created
you
to
worship
him
you
can
make
yourselves
like
unto
him
wisdom
will
make
you
equal
to
him
if
you
will
follow
it
raise
your
heads
free
men
says
epictetus
and
others
say
bend
your
eyes
to
the
earth
wretched
worm
that
you
are
and
consider
the
brutes
whose
companion
you
are
what
then
will
man
become
will
he
be
equal
to
god
or
the
brutes
what
a
frightful
difference
what
then
shall
we
be
who
does
not
see
from
all
this
that
man
has
gone
astray
that
he
has
fallen
from
his
place
that
he
anxiously
seeks
it
that
he
can
not
find
it
again
and
who
shall
then
direct
him
to
it
the
greatest
men
have
failed
scepticism
is
true
for
after
all
men
before
jesus
christ
did
not
know
where
they
were
nor
whether
they
were
great
or
small
and
those
who
have
said
the
one
or
the
other
knew
nothing
about
it
and
guessed
without
reason
and
by
chance
they
also
erred
always
in
excluding
the
one
or
the
other
ergo
ignorantes
quæritis
religio
annuntiat
having
understood
the
whole
nature
of
that
a
religion
may
be
true
it
must
have
knowledge
of
our
nature
it
ought
to
know
its
greatness
and
littleness
and
the
reason
of
both
what
religion
but
the
christian
has
known
this
the
chief
arguments
of
the
sceptics
i
pass
over
the
lesser
ones
are
that
we
have
no
certainty
of
the
truth
of
these
principles
apart
from
faith
and
revelation
except
in
so
far
as
we
naturally
perceive
them
in
ourselves
now
this
natural
intuition
is
not
a
convincing
proof
of
their
truth
since
having
no
certainty
apart
from
faith
whether
man
was
created
by
a
good
god
or
by
a
wicked
demon
or
by
chance
it
is
doubtful
whether
these
principles
given
to
us
are
true
or
false
or
uncertain
according
to
our
origin
again
no
person
is
certain
apart
from
faith
whether
he
is
awake
or
sleeps
seeing
that
during
sleep
we
believe
that
we
are
awake
as
firmly
as
we
do
when
we
awake
we
believe
that
we
see
space
figure
and
motion
we
are
aware
of
the
passage
of
time
we
measure
it
and
in
fact
we
act
as
if
we
were
awake
so
that
half
of
our
life
being
passed
in
sleep
we
have
on
our
own
admission
no
idea
of
truth
whatever
we
may
imagine
as
all
our
intuitions
are
then
illusions
who
knows
whether
the
other
half
of
our
life
in
which
we
think
we
are
awake
is
not
another
sleep
a
little
different
from
the
former
from
which
we
awake
when
we
suppose
ourselves
asleep
and
who
doubts
that
if
we
dreamt
in
company
and
the
dreams
chanced
to
agree
which
is
common
enough
and
if
we
were
always
alone
when
awake
we
should
believe
that
matters
were
reversed
in
short
as
we
often
dream
that
we
dream
heaping
dream
upon
dream
may
it
not
be
that
this
half
of
our
life
wherein
we
think
ourselves
awake
is
itself
only
a
dream
on
which
the
others
are
grafted
from
which
we
wake
at
death
during
which
we
have
as
few
principles
of
truth
and
good
as
during
natural
sleep
these
different
thoughts
which
disturb
us
being
perhaps
only
illusions
like
the
flight
of
time
and
the
vain
fancies
of
our
dreams
these
are
the
chief
arguments
on
one
side
and
the
other
i
omit
minor
ones
such
as
the
sceptical
talk
against
the
impressions
of
custom
education
manners
country
and
the
like
though
these
influence
the
majority
of
common
folk
who
dogmatise
only
on
shallow
foundations
they
are
upset
by
the
least
breath
of
the
sceptics
we
have
only
to
see
their
books
if
we
are
not
sufficiently
convinced
of
this
and
we
shall
very
quickly
become
so
perhaps
too
much
i
notice
the
only
strong
point
of
the
dogmatists
namely
that
speaking
in
good
faith
and
sincerely
we
can
not
doubt
natural
principles
against
this
the
sceptics
set
up
in
one
word
the
uncertainty
of
our
origin
which
includes
that
of
our
nature
the
dogmatists
have
been
trying
to
answer
this
objection
ever
since
the
world
began
so
there
is
open
war
among
men
in
which
each
must
take
a
part
and
side
either
with
dogmatism
or
scepticism
for
he
who
thinks
to
remain
neutral
is
above
all
a
sceptic
this
neutrality
is
the
essence
of
the
sect
he
who
is
not
against
them
is
essentially
for
them
in
this
appears
their
advantage
they
are
not
for
themselves
they
are
neutral
indifferent
in
suspense
as
to
all
things
even
themselves
being
no
exception
what
then
shall
man
do
in
this
state
shall
he
doubt
everything
shall
he
doubt
whether
he
is
awake
whether
he
is
being
pinched
or
whether
he
is
being
burned
shall
he
doubt
whether
he
doubts
shall
he
doubt
whether
he
exists
we
can
not
go
so
far
as
that
and
i
lay
it
down
as
a
fact
that
there
never
has
been
a
real
complete
sceptic
nature
sustains
our
feeble
reason
and
prevents
it
raving
to
this
extent
shall
he
then
say
on
the
contrary
that
he
certainly
possesses
truth
he
who
when
pressed
ever
so
little
can
show
no
title
to
it
and
is
forced
to
let
go
his
hold
what
a
chimera
then
is
man
what
a
novelty
what
a
monster
what
a
chaos
what
a
contradiction
what
a
prodigy
judge
of
all
things
imbecile
worm
of
the
earth
depositary
of
truth
a
sink
of
uncertainty
and
error
the
pride
and
refuse
of
the
universe
who
will
unravel
this
tangle
nature
confutes
the
sceptics
and
reason
confutes
the
dogmatists
what
then
will
you
become
o
men
who
try
to
find
out
by
your
natural
reason
what
is
your
true
condition
you
can
not
avoid
one
of
these
sects
nor
adhere
to
one
of
them
know
then
proud
man
what
a
paradox
you
are
to
yourself
humble
yourself
weak
reason
be
silent
foolish
nature
learn
that
man
infinitely
transcends
man
and
learn
from
your
master
your
true
condition
of
which
you
are
ignorant
hear
god
for
in
fact
if
man
had
never
been
corrupt
he
would
enjoy
in
his
innocence
both
truth
and
happiness
with
assurance
and
if
man
had
always
been
corrupt
he
would
have
no
idea
of
truth
or
bliss
but
wretched
as
we
are
and
more
so
than
if
there
were
no
greatness
in
our
condition
we
have
an
idea
of
happiness
and
can
not
reach
it
we
perceive
an
image
of
truth
and
possess
only
a
lie
incapable
of
absolute
ignorance
and
of
certain
knowledge
we
have
thus
been
manifestly
in
a
degree
of
perfection
from
which
we
have
unhappily
fallen
it
is
however
an
astonishing
thing
that
the
mystery
furthest
removed
from
our
knowledge
namely
that
of
the
transmission
of
sin
should
be
a
fact
without
which
we
can
have
no
knowledge
of
ourselves
for
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
there
is
nothing
which
more
shocks
our
reason
than
to
say
that
the
sin
of
the
first
man
has
rendered
guilty
those
who
being
so
removed
from
this
source
seem
incapable
of
participation
in
it
this
transmission
does
not
only
seem
to
us
impossible
it
seems
also
very
unjust
for
what
is
more
contrary
to
the
rules
of
our
miserable
justice
than
to
damn
eternally
an
infant
incapable
of
will
for
a
sin
wherein
he
seems
to
have
so
little
a
share
that
it
was
committed
six
thousand
years
before
he
was
in
existence
certainly
nothing
offends
us
more
rudely
than
this
doctrine
and
yet
without
this
mystery
the
most
incomprehensible
of
all
we
are
incomprehensible
to
ourselves
the
knot
of
our
condition
takes
its
twists
and
turns
in
this
abyss
so
that
man
is
more
inconceivable
without
this
mystery
than
this
mystery
is
inconceivable
to
man
whence
it
seems
that
god
willing
to
render
the
difficulty
of
our
existence
unintelligible
to
ourselves
has
concealed
the
knot
so
high
or
better
speaking
so
low
that
we
are
quite
incapable
of
reaching
it
so
that
it
is
not
by
the
proud
exertions
of
our
reason
but
by
the
simple
submissions
of
reason
that
we
can
truly
know
ourselves
these
foundations
solidly
established
on
the
inviolable
authority
of
religion
make
us
know
that
there
are
two
truths
of
faith
equally
certain
the
one
that
man
in
the
state
of
creation
or
in
that
of
grace
is
raised
above
all
nature
made
like
unto
god
and
sharing
in
his
divinity
the
other
that
in
the
state
of
corruption
and
sin
he
is
fallen
from
this
state
and
made
like
unto
the
beasts
these
two
propositions
are
equally
sound
and
certain
scripture
manifestly
declares
this
to
us
when
it
says
in
some
places
meæ
esse
cum
filiis
hominum
effundam
spiritum
meum
super
omnem
carnem
dii
estis
etc
and
in
other
places
caro
fænum
homo
assimilatus
est
jumentis
insipientibus
et
similis
factus
est
illis
dixi
in
corde
meo
de
filiis
eccles
iii
whence
it
clearly
seems
that
man
by
grace
is
made
like
unto
god
and
a
partaker
in
his
divinity
and
that
without
grace
he
is
like
unto
the
brute
beasts
without
this
divine
knowledge
what
could
men
do
but
either
become
elated
by
the
inner
feeling
of
their
past
greatness
which
still
remains
to
them
or
become
despondent
at
the
sight
of
their
present
weakness
for
not
seeing
the
whole
truth
they
could
not
attain
to
perfect
virtue
some
considering
nature
as
incorrupt
others
as
incurable
they
could
not
escape
either
pride
or
sloth
the
two
sources
of
all
vice
since
they
can
not
but
either
abandon
themselves
to
it
through
cowardice
or
escape
it
by
pride
for
if
they
knew
the
excellence
of
man
they
were
ignorant
of
his
corruption
so
that
they
easily
avoided
sloth
but
fell
into
pride
and
if
they
recognised
the
infirmity
of
nature
they
were
ignorant
of
its
dignity
so
that
they
could
easily
avoid
vanity
but
it
was
to
fall
into
despair
thence
arise
the
different
schools
of
the
stoics
and
epicureans
the
dogmatists
academicians
etc
the
christian
religion
alone
has
been
able
to
cure
these
two
vices
not
by
expelling
the
one
through
means
of
the
other
according
to
the
wisdom
of
the
world
but
by
expelling
both
according
to
the
simplicity
of
the
gospel
for
it
teaches
the
righteous
that
it
raises
them
even
to
a
participation
in
divinity
itself
that
in
this
lofty
state
they
still
carry
the
source
of
all
corruption
which
renders
them
during
all
their
life
subject
to
error
misery
death
and
sin
and
it
proclaims
to
the
most
ungodly
that
they
are
capable
of
the
grace
of
their
redeemer
so
making
those
tremble
whom
it
justifies
and
consoling
those
whom
it
condemns
religion
so
justly
tempers
fear
with
hope
through
that
double
capacity
of
grace
and
of
sin
common
to
all
that
it
humbles
infinitely
more
than
reason
alone
can
do
but
without
despair
and
it
exalts
infinitely
more
than
natural
pride
but
without
inflating
thus
making
it
evident
that
alone
being
exempt
from
error
and
vice
it
alone
fulfils
the
duty
of
instructing
and
correcting
men
who
then
can
refuse
to
believe
and
adore
this
heavenly
light
for
is
it
not
clearer
than
day
that
we
perceive
within
ourselves
ineffaceable
marks
of
excellence
and
is
it
not
equally
true
that
we
experience
every
hour
the
results
of
our
deplorable
condition
what
does
this
chaos
and
monstrous
confusion
proclaim
to
us
but
the
truth
of
these
two
states
with
a
voice
so
powerful
that
it
is
impossible
to
resist
it
every
pursuit
of
men
is
to
get
wealth
and
they
can
not
have
a
title
to
show
that
they
possess
it
justly
for
they
have
only
that
of
human
caprice
nor
have
they
strength
to
hold
it
securely
it
is
the
same
with
knowledge
for
disease
takes
it
away
we
are
incapable
both
of
truth
and
goodness
we
desire
truth
and
find
within
ourselves
only
uncertainty
we
seek
happiness
and
find
only
misery
and
death
we
can
not
but
desire
truth
and
happiness
and
are
incapable
of
certainty
or
happiness
this
desire
is
left
to
us
partly
to
punish
us
partly
to
make
us
perceive
wherefrom
we
are
fallen
if
man
is
not
made
for
god
why
is
he
only
happy
in
god
if
man
is
made
for
god
why
is
he
so
opposed
to
god
man
does
not
act
by
reason
which
constitutes
his
being
the
corruption
of
reason
is
shown
by
the
existence
of
so
many
different
and
extravagant
customs
it
was
necessary
that
truth
should
come
in
order
that
man
should
no
longer
dwell
within
himself
for
myself
i
confess
that
so
soon
as
the
christian
religion
reveals
the
principle
that
human
nature
is
corrupt
and
fallen
from
god
that
opens
my
eyes
to
see
everywhere
the
mark
of
this
truth
for
nature
is
such
that
she
testifies
everywhere
both
within
man
and
without
him
to
a
lost
god
and
a
corrupt
nature
man
true
nature
his
true
good
true
virtue
and
true
religion
are
things
of
which
the
knowledge
is
inseparable
the
more
light
we
have
the
more
greatness
and
the
more
baseness
we
discover
in
man
ordinary
men
those
who
are
more
educated
philosophers
they
astonish
ordinary
men
christians
they
astonish
philosophers
who
will
then
be
surprised
to
see
that
religion
only
makes
us
know
profoundly
what
we
already
know
in
proportion
to
our
light
this
religion
taught
to
her
children
what
men
have
only
been
able
to
discover
by
their
greatest
knowledge
original
sin
is
foolishness
to
men
but
it
is
admitted
to
be
such
you
must
not
then
reproach
me
for
the
want
of
reason
in
this
doctrine
since
i
admit
it
to
be
without
reason
but
this
foolishness
is
wiser
than
all
the
wisdom
of
men
est
for
without
this
what
can
we
say
that
man
is
his
whole
state
depends
on
this
imperceptible
point
and
how
should
it
be
perceived
by
his
reason
since
it
is
a
thing
against
reason
and
since
reason
far
from
finding
it
out
by
her
own
ways
is
averse
to
it
when
it
is
presented
to
her
original
sin
ample
tradition
of
original
sin
according
to
the
on
the
saying
in
genesis
viii
the
imagination
of
man
heart
is
evil
from
his
youth
moses
this
evil
leaven
is
placed
in
man
from
the
time
that
he
is
formed
this
evil
leaven
has
seven
names
in
scripture
it
is
called
the
foreskin
uncleanness
an
enemy
a
scandal
a
heart
of
stone
the
north
all
this
signifies
the
malignity
which
is
concealed
and
impressed
in
the
heart
of
man
says
the
same
thing
and
that
god
will
deliver
the
good
nature
of
man
from
the
evil
this
malignity
is
renewed
every
day
against
man
as
it
is
written
psalm
xxxvii
the
wicked
watcheth
the
righteous
and
seeketh
to
slay
him
but
god
will
not
abandon
him
this
malignity
tries
the
heart
of
man
in
this
life
and
will
accuse
him
in
the
other
all
this
is
found
in
the
talmud
on
psalm
iv
stand
in
awe
and
sin
not
stand
in
awe
and
be
afraid
of
your
lust
and
it
will
not
lead
you
into
sin
and
on
psalm
xxxvi
the
wicked
has
said
within
his
own
heart
let
not
the
fear
of
god
be
before
me
that
is
to
say
that
the
malignity
natural
to
man
has
said
that
to
the
wicked
el
better
is
a
poor
and
wise
child
than
an
old
and
foolish
king
who
can
not
foresee
the
future
the
child
is
virtue
and
the
king
is
the
malignity
of
man
it
is
called
king
because
all
the
members
obey
it
and
old
because
it
is
in
the
human
heart
from
infancy
to
old
age
and
foolish
because
it
leads
man
in
the
way
of
which
he
does
not
foresee
the
same
thing
is
in
on
psalm
xxxv
lord
all
my
bones
shall
bless
thee
which
deliverest
the
poor
from
the
tyrant
and
is
there
a
greater
tyrant
than
the
evil
leaven
and
on
proverbs
xxv
if
thine
enemy
be
hungry
give
him
bread
to
eat
that
is
to
say
if
the
evil
leaven
hunger
give
him
the
bread
of
wisdom
of
which
it
is
spoken
in
proverbs
and
if
he
be
thirsty
give
him
the
water
of
which
it
is
spoken
in
isaiah
lv
says
the
same
thing
and
that
scripture
in
that
passage
speaking
of
the
enemy
means
the
evil
leaven
and
that
in
him
that
bread
and
that
water
we
heap
coals
of
fire
on
his
head
el
on
ecclesiastes
ix
a
great
king
besieged
a
little
city
this
great
king
is
the
evil
leaven
the
great
bulwarks
built
against
it
are
temptations
and
there
has
been
found
a
poor
wise
man
who
has
delivered
it
that
is
to
say
virtue
and
on
psalm
xli
blessed
is
he
that
considereth
the
poor
and
on
psalm
lxxviii
the
spirit
passeth
away
and
cometh
not
again
whence
some
have
erroneously
argued
against
the
immortality
of
the
soul
but
the
sense
is
that
this
spirit
is
the
evil
leaven
which
accompanies
man
till
death
and
will
not
return
at
the
resurrection
and
on
psalm
ciii
the
same
thing
and
on
psalm
xvi
principles
of
rabbinism
two
messiahs
will
it
be
said
that
as
men
have
declared
that
righteousness
has
departed
the
earth
they
therefore
knew
of
original
sin
ante
obitum
beatus
that
is
to
say
they
knew
death
to
be
the
beginning
of
eternal
and
essential
happiness
sees
well
that
nature
is
corrupt
and
that
men
are
averse
to
virtue
but
he
does
not
know
why
they
can
not
fly
higher
after
to
say
it
is
right
that
all
those
who
are
in
that
state
should
know
it
both
those
who
are
content
with
it
and
those
who
are
not
content
with
it
but
it
is
not
right
that
all
should
see
redemption
if
we
do
not
know
ourselves
to
be
full
of
pride
ambition
lust
weakness
misery
and
injustice
we
are
indeed
blind
and
if
knowing
this
we
do
not
desire
deliverance
what
can
we
say
of
a
man
what
then
can
we
have
but
esteem
for
a
religion
which
knows
so
well
the
defects
of
man
and
desire
for
the
truth
of
a
religion
which
promises
remedies
so
desirable
all
men
naturally
hate
one
another
they
employ
lust
as
far
as
possible
in
the
service
of
the
public
weal
but
this
is
only
a
and
a
false
image
of
love
for
at
bottom
it
is
only
hate
to
pity
the
unfortunate
is
not
contrary
to
lust
on
the
contrary
we
can
quite
well
give
such
evidence
of
friendship
and
acquire
the
reputation
of
kindly
feeling
without
giving
anything
from
lust
men
have
found
and
extracted
excellent
rules
of
policy
morality
and
justice
but
in
reality
this
vile
root
of
man
this
is
only
covered
it
is
not
taken
away
they
have
not
found
any
other
means
of
satisfying
lust
without
doing
injury
to
others
self
is
hateful
you
miton
conceal
it
you
do
not
for
that
reason
destroy
it
you
are
then
always
hateful
no
for
in
acting
as
we
do
to
oblige
everybody
we
give
no
more
occasion
for
hatred
of
that
is
true
if
we
only
hated
in
self
the
vexation
which
comes
to
us
from
it
but
if
i
hate
it
because
it
is
unjust
and
because
it
makes
itself
the
centre
of
everything
i
shall
always
hate
it
in
a
word
the
self
has
two
qualities
it
is
unjust
in
itself
since
it
makes
itself
the
centre
of
everything
it
is
inconvenient
to
others
since
it
would
enslave
them
for
each
self
is
the
enemy
and
would
like
to
be
the
tyrant
of
all
others
you
take
away
its
inconvenience
but
not
its
injustice
and
so
you
do
not
render
it
lovable
to
those
who
hate
injustice
you
render
it
lovable
only
to
the
unjust
who
do
not
any
longer
find
in
it
an
enemy
and
thus
you
remain
unjust
and
can
please
only
the
unjust
it
is
a
perverted
judgment
that
makes
every
one
place
himself
above
the
rest
of
the
world
and
prefer
his
own
good
and
the
continuance
of
his
own
good
fortune
and
life
to
that
of
the
rest
of
the
world
each
one
is
all
in
all
to
himself
for
he
being
dead
all
is
dead
to
him
hence
it
comes
that
each
believes
himself
to
be
all
in
all
to
everybody
we
must
not
judge
of
nature
by
ourselves
but
by
it
all
that
is
in
the
world
is
the
lust
of
the
flesh
or
the
lust
of
the
eyes
or
the
pride
of
life
sentiendi
libido
sciendi
libido
wretched
is
the
cursed
land
which
these
three
rivers
of
fire
enflame
rather
than
water
happy
they
who
on
these
rivers
are
not
overwhelmed
nor
carried
away
but
are
immovably
fixed
not
standing
but
seated
on
a
low
and
secure
base
whence
they
do
not
rise
before
the
light
but
having
rested
in
peace
stretch
out
their
hands
to
him
who
must
lift
them
up
and
make
them
stand
upright
and
firm
in
the
porches
of
the
holy
jerusalem
there
pride
can
no
longer
assail
them
nor
cast
them
down
and
yet
they
weep
not
to
see
all
those
perishable
things
swept
away
by
the
torrents
but
at
the
remembrance
of
their
loved
country
the
heavenly
jerusalem
which
they
remember
without
ceasing
during
their
prolonged
exile
the
rivers
of
babylon
rush
and
fall
and
sweep
away
o
holy
sion
where
all
is
firm
and
nothing
falls
we
must
sit
upon
the
waters
not
under
them
or
in
them
but
on
them
and
not
standing
but
seated
being
seated
to
be
humble
and
being
above
them
to
be
secure
but
we
shall
stand
in
the
porches
of
jerusalem
let
us
see
if
this
pleasure
is
stable
or
transitory
if
it
pass
away
it
is
a
river
of
babylon
lust
of
the
flesh
the
lust
of
the
eyes
pride
there
are
three
orders
of
things
the
flesh
the
spirit
and
the
will
the
carnal
are
the
rich
and
kings
they
have
the
body
as
their
object
inquirers
and
scientists
they
have
the
mind
as
their
object
the
wise
they
have
righteousness
as
their
object
god
must
reign
over
all
and
all
men
must
be
brought
back
to
him
in
things
of
the
flesh
lust
reigns
specially
in
intellectual
matters
inquiry
specially
in
wisdom
pride
specially
not
that
a
man
can
not
boast
of
wealth
or
knowledge
but
it
is
not
the
place
for
pride
for
in
granting
to
a
man
that
he
is
learned
it
is
easy
to
convince
him
that
he
is
wrong
to
be
proud
the
proper
place
for
pride
is
in
wisdom
for
it
can
not
be
granted
to
a
man
that
he
has
made
himself
wise
and
that
he
is
wrong
to
be
proud
for
that
is
right
now
god
alone
gives
wisdom
and
that
is
why
gloriatur
in
domino
the
three
lusts
have
made
three
sects
and
the
philosophers
have
done
no
other
thing
than
follow
one
of
the
three
lusts
for
the
true
ordinary
men
place
the
good
in
fortune
and
external
goods
or
at
least
in
amusement
philosophers
have
shown
the
vanity
of
all
this
and
have
placed
it
where
they
could
the
philosophers
who
believe
in
god
without
jesus
they
believe
that
god
alone
is
worthy
to
be
loved
and
admired
and
they
have
desired
to
be
loved
and
admired
of
men
and
do
not
know
their
own
corruption
if
they
feel
full
of
feelings
of
love
and
admiration
and
find
therein
their
chief
delight
very
well
let
them
think
themselves
good
but
if
they
find
themselves
averse
to
him
if
they
have
no
inclination
but
the
desire
to
establish
themselves
in
the
esteem
of
men
and
if
their
whole
perfection
consists
only
in
making
men
but
without
constraint
find
their
happiness
in
loving
them
i
declare
that
this
perfection
is
horrible
what
they
have
known
god
and
have
not
desired
solely
that
men
should
love
him
but
that
men
should
stop
short
at
them
they
have
wanted
to
be
the
object
of
the
voluntary
delight
of
men
we
are
full
of
things
which
take
us
out
of
ourselves
our
instinct
makes
us
feel
that
we
must
seek
our
happiness
outside
ourselves
our
passions
impel
us
outside
even
when
no
objects
present
themselves
to
excite
them
external
objects
tempt
us
of
themselves
and
call
to
us
even
when
we
are
not
thinking
of
them
and
thus
philosophers
have
said
in
vain
retire
within
yourselves
you
will
find
your
good
there
we
do
not
believe
them
and
those
who
believe
them
are
the
most
empty
and
the
most
foolish
the
stoics
say
retire
within
yourselves
it
is
there
you
will
find
your
rest
and
that
is
not
true
others
say
go
out
of
yourselves
seek
happiness
in
amusement
and
this
is
not
true
illness
comes
happiness
is
neither
without
us
nor
within
us
it
is
in
god
both
without
us
and
within
us
had
epictetus
seen
the
way
perfectly
he
would
have
said
to
men
you
follow
a
wrong
road
he
shows
that
there
is
another
but
he
does
not
lead
to
it
it
is
the
way
of
willing
what
god
wills
jesus
christ
alone
leads
to
it
the
vices
of
zeno
himself
reason
of
epictetus
those
who
say
you
have
a
headache
this
is
not
the
same
thing
we
are
assured
of
health
and
not
of
justice
and
in
fact
his
own
was
nonsense
and
yet
he
believed
it
demonstrable
when
he
said
it
is
either
in
our
power
or
it
is
not
but
he
did
not
perceive
that
it
is
not
in
our
power
to
regulate
the
heart
and
he
was
wrong
to
infer
this
from
the
fact
that
there
were
some
christians
no
other
religion
has
proposed
to
men
to
hate
themselves
no
other
religion
then
can
please
those
who
hate
themselves
and
who
seek
a
being
truly
lovable
and
these
if
they
had
never
heard
of
the
religion
of
a
god
humiliated
would
embrace
it
at
once
i
feel
that
i
might
not
have
been
for
the
ego
consists
in
my
thoughts
therefore
i
who
think
would
not
have
been
if
my
mother
had
been
killed
before
i
had
life
i
am
not
then
a
necessary
being
in
the
same
way
i
am
not
eternal
or
infinite
but
i
see
plainly
that
there
exists
in
nature
a
necessary
being
eternal
and
infinite
had
i
seen
a
miracle
say
men
i
should
become
converted
how
can
they
be
sure
they
would
do
a
thing
of
the
nature
of
which
they
are
ignorant
they
imagine
that
this
conversion
consists
in
a
worship
of
god
which
is
like
commerce
and
in
a
communion
such
as
they
picture
to
themselves
true
religion
consists
in
annihilating
self
before
that
universal
being
whom
we
have
so
often
provoked
and
who
can
justly
destroy
us
at
any
time
in
recognising
that
we
can
do
nothing
without
him
and
have
deserved
nothing
from
him
but
his
displeasure
it
consists
in
knowing
that
there
is
an
unconquerable
opposition
between
us
and
god
and
that
without
a
mediator
there
can
be
no
communion
with
him
it
is
unjust
that
men
should
attach
themselves
to
me
even
though
they
do
it
with
pleasure
and
voluntarily
i
should
deceive
those
in
whom
i
had
created
this
desire
for
i
am
not
the
end
of
any
and
i
have
not
the
wherewithal
to
satisfy
them
am
i
not
about
to
die
and
thus
the
object
of
their
attachment
will
die
therefore
as
i
would
be
blamable
in
causing
a
falsehood
to
be
believed
though
i
should
employ
gentle
persuasion
though
it
should
be
believed
with
pleasure
and
though
it
should
give
me
pleasure
even
so
i
am
blamable
in
making
myself
loved
and
if
i
attract
persons
to
attach
themselves
to
me
i
ought
to
warn
those
who
are
ready
to
consent
to
a
lie
that
they
ought
not
to
believe
it
whatever
advantage
comes
to
me
from
it
and
likewise
that
they
ought
not
to
attach
themselves
to
me
for
they
ought
to
spend
their
life
and
their
care
in
pleasing
god
or
in
seeking
him
will
never
be
satisfied
though
it
should
have
command
of
all
it
would
but
we
are
satisfied
from
the
moment
we
renounce
it
without
it
we
can
not
be
discontented
with
it
we
can
not
be
content
let
us
imagine
a
body
full
of
thinking
members
to
commence
with
to
regulate
the
love
which
we
owe
to
ourselves
we
must
imagine
a
body
full
of
thinking
members
for
we
are
members
of
the
whole
and
must
see
how
each
member
should
love
itself
etc
if
the
feet
and
the
hands
had
a
will
of
their
own
they
could
only
be
in
their
order
in
submitting
this
particular
will
to
the
primary
will
which
governs
the
whole
body
apart
from
that
they
are
in
disorder
and
mischief
but
in
willing
only
the
good
of
the
body
they
accomplish
their
own
good
we
must
love
god
only
and
hate
self
only
if
the
foot
had
always
been
ignorant
that
it
belonged
to
the
body
and
that
there
was
a
body
on
which
it
depended
if
it
had
only
had
the
knowledge
and
the
love
of
self
and
if
it
came
to
know
that
it
belonged
to
a
body
on
which
it
depended
what
regret
what
shame
for
its
past
life
for
having
been
useless
to
the
body
which
inspired
its
life
which
would
have
annihilated
it
if
it
had
rejected
it
and
separated
it
from
itself
as
it
kept
itself
apart
from
the
body
what
prayers
for
its
preservation
in
it
and
with
what
submission
would
it
allow
itself
to
be
governed
by
the
will
which
rules
the
body
even
to
consenting
if
necessary
to
be
cut
off
or
it
would
lose
its
character
as
member
for
every
member
must
be
quite
willing
to
perish
for
the
body
for
which
alone
the
whole
is
it
is
false
that
we
are
worthy
of
the
love
of
others
it
is
unfair
that
we
should
desire
it
if
we
were
born
reasonable
and
impartial
knowing
ourselves
and
others
we
should
not
give
this
bias
to
our
will
however
we
are
born
with
it
therefore
born
unjust
for
all
tends
to
self
this
is
contrary
to
all
order
we
must
consider
the
general
good
and
the
propensity
to
self
is
the
beginning
of
all
disorder
in
war
in
politics
in
economy
and
in
the
particular
body
of
man
the
will
is
therefore
depraved
if
the
members
of
natural
and
civil
communities
tend
towards
the
weal
of
the
body
the
communities
themselves
ought
to
look
to
another
more
general
body
of
which
they
are
members
we
ought
therefore
to
look
to
the
whole
we
are
therefore
born
unjust
and
depraved
when
we
want
to
think
of
god
is
there
nothing
which
turns
us
away
and
tempts
us
to
think
of
something
else
all
this
is
bad
and
is
born
in
us
if
there
is
a
god
we
must
love
him
only
and
not
the
creatures
of
a
day
the
reasoning
of
the
ungodly
in
the
book
of
wisdom
is
only
based
upon
the
of
god
on
that
supposition
say
they
let
us
take
delight
in
the
creatures
that
is
the
worst
that
can
happen
but
if
there
were
a
god
to
love
they
would
not
have
come
to
this
conclusion
but
to
quite
the
contrary
and
this
is
the
conclusion
of
the
wise
there
is
a
god
let
us
therefore
not
take
delight
in
the
creatures
therefore
all
that
incites
us
to
attach
ourselves
to
the
creatures
is
bad
since
it
prevents
us
from
serving
god
if
we
know
him
or
from
seeking
him
if
we
know
him
not
now
we
are
full
of
lust
therefore
we
are
full
of
evil
therefore
we
ought
to
hate
ourselves
and
all
that
excited
us
to
attach
ourselves
to
any
other
object
than
god
only
to
make
the
members
happy
they
must
have
one
will
and
submit
it
to
the
body
the
examples
of
the
noble
deaths
of
the
lacedæmonians
and
others
scarce
touch
us
for
what
good
is
it
to
us
but
the
example
of
the
death
of
the
martyrs
touches
us
for
they
are
our
members
we
have
a
common
tie
with
them
their
resolution
can
form
ours
not
only
by
example
but
because
it
has
perhaps
deserved
ours
there
is
nothing
of
this
in
the
examples
of
the
heathen
we
have
no
tie
with
them
as
we
do
not
become
rich
by
seeing
a
stranger
who
is
so
but
in
fact
by
seeing
a
father
or
a
husband
who
is
so
god
having
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
which
do
not
feel
the
happiness
of
their
being
he
has
willed
to
make
beings
who
should
know
it
and
who
should
compose
a
body
of
thinking
members
for
our
members
do
not
feel
the
happiness
of
their
union
of
their
wonderful
intelligence
of
the
care
which
has
been
taken
to
infuse
into
them
minds
and
to
make
them
grow
and
endure
how
happy
they
would
be
if
they
saw
and
felt
it
but
for
this
they
would
need
to
have
intelligence
to
know
it
and
to
consent
to
that
of
the
universal
soul
but
if
having
received
intelligence
they
employed
it
to
retain
nourishment
for
themselves
without
allowing
it
to
pass
to
the
other
members
they
would
hate
rather
than
love
themselves
their
blessedness
as
well
as
their
duty
consisting
in
their
consent
to
the
guidance
of
the
whole
soul
to
which
they
belong
which
loves
them
better
than
they
love
themselves
to
be
a
member
is
to
have
neither
life
being
nor
movement
except
through
the
spirit
of
the
body
and
for
the
body
the
separate
member
seeing
no
longer
the
body
to
which
it
belongs
has
only
a
perishing
and
dying
existence
yet
it
believes
it
is
a
whole
and
seeing
not
the
body
on
which
it
depends
it
believes
it
depends
only
on
self
and
desires
to
make
itself
both
centre
and
body
but
not
having
in
itself
a
principle
of
life
it
only
goes
astray
and
is
astonished
in
the
uncertainty
of
its
being
perceiving
in
fact
that
it
is
not
a
body
and
still
not
seeing
that
it
is
a
member
of
a
body
in
short
when
it
comes
to
know
itself
it
has
returned
as
it
were
to
its
own
home
and
loves
itself
only
for
the
body
it
deplores
its
past
wanderings
it
can
not
by
its
nature
love
any
other
thing
except
for
itself
and
to
subject
it
to
self
because
each
thing
loves
itself
more
than
all
but
in
loving
the
body
it
loves
itself
because
it
only
exists
in
it
by
it
and
for
it
adhæret
deo
unus
spiritus
the
body
loves
the
hand
and
the
hand
if
it
had
a
will
should
love
itself
in
the
same
way
as
it
is
loved
by
the
soul
all
love
which
goes
beyond
this
is
unfair
deo
unus
spiritus
we
love
ourselves
because
we
are
members
of
jesus
christ
we
love
jesus
christ
because
he
is
the
body
of
which
we
are
members
all
is
one
one
is
in
the
other
like
the
three
persons
two
laws
suffice
to
rule
the
whole
christian
republic
better
than
all
the
laws
of
statecraft
the
true
and
only
virtue
then
is
to
hate
self
for
we
are
hateful
on
account
of
lust
and
to
seek
a
truly
lovable
being
to
love
but
as
we
can
not
love
what
is
outside
ourselves
we
must
love
a
being
who
is
in
us
and
is
not
ourselves
and
that
is
true
of
each
and
all
men
now
only
the
universal
being
is
such
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
us
the
universal
good
is
within
us
is
ourselves
and
not
ourselves
the
dignity
of
man
in
his
innocence
consisted
in
using
and
having
dominion
over
the
creatures
but
now
in
separating
himself
from
them
and
subjecting
himself
to
them
every
religion
is
false
which
as
to
its
faith
does
not
worship
one
god
as
the
origin
of
everything
and
which
as
to
its
morality
does
not
love
one
only
god
as
the
object
of
everything
but
it
is
impossible
that
god
should
ever
be
the
end
if
he
is
not
the
beginning
we
lift
our
eyes
on
high
but
lean
upon
the
sand
and
the
earth
will
dissolve
and
we
shall
fall
whilst
looking
at
the
heavens
if
there
is
one
sole
source
of
everything
there
is
one
sole
end
of
everything
everything
through
him
everything
for
him
the
true
religion
then
must
teach
us
to
worship
him
only
and
to
love
him
only
but
as
we
find
ourselves
unable
to
worship
what
we
know
not
and
to
love
any
other
object
but
ourselves
the
religion
which
instructs
us
in
these
duties
must
instruct
us
also
of
this
inability
and
teach
us
also
the
remedies
for
it
it
teaches
us
that
by
one
man
all
was
lost
and
the
bond
broken
between
god
and
us
and
that
by
one
man
the
bond
is
renewed
we
are
born
so
averse
to
this
love
of
god
and
it
is
so
necessary
that
we
must
be
born
guilty
or
god
would
be
unjust
men
not
being
accustomed
to
form
merit
but
only
to
recompense
it
where
they
find
it
formed
judge
of
god
by
themselves
the
true
religion
must
have
as
a
characteristic
the
obligation
to
love
god
this
is
very
just
and
yet
no
other
religion
has
commanded
this
ours
has
done
so
it
must
also
be
aware
of
human
lust
and
weakness
ours
is
so
it
must
have
adduced
remedies
for
this
one
is
prayer
no
other
religion
has
asked
of
god
to
love
and
follow
him
he
who
hates
not
in
himself
his
and
that
instinct
which
leads
him
to
make
himself
god
is
indeed
blinded
who
does
not
see
that
there
is
nothing
so
opposed
to
justice
and
truth
for
it
is
false
that
we
deserve
this
and
it
is
unfair
and
impossible
to
attain
it
since
all
demand
the
same
thing
it
is
then
a
manifest
injustice
which
is
innate
in
us
of
which
we
can
not
get
rid
and
of
which
we
must
get
rid
yet
no
religion
has
indicated
that
this
was
a
sin
or
that
we
were
born
in
it
or
that
we
were
obliged
to
resist
it
or
has
thought
of
giving
us
remedies
for
it
the
true
religion
teaches
our
duties
our
weaknesses
pride
and
lust
and
the
remedies
humility
and
mortification
the
true
religion
must
teach
greatness
and
misery
must
lead
to
the
esteem
and
contempt
of
self
to
love
and
to
hate
if
it
is
an
extraordinary
blindness
to
live
without
investigating
what
we
are
it
is
a
terrible
one
to
live
an
evil
life
while
believing
in
god
experience
makes
us
see
an
enormous
difference
between
piety
and
goodness
those
who
trusting
to
the
mercy
of
god
live
heedlessly
without
doing
good
as
the
two
sources
of
our
sins
are
pride
and
sloth
god
has
revealed
to
us
two
of
his
attributes
to
cure
them
mercy
and
justice
the
property
of
justice
is
to
humble
pride
however
holy
may
be
our
works
non
intres
in
etc
and
the
property
of
mercy
is
to
combat
sloth
by
exhorting
to
good
works
according
to
that
passage
the
goodness
of
god
leadeth
to
repentance
and
that
other
of
the
ninevites
let
us
do
penance
to
see
if
peradventure
he
will
pity
us
and
thus
mercy
is
so
far
from
authorising
slackness
that
it
is
on
the
contrary
the
quality
which
formally
attacks
it
so
that
instead
of
saying
if
there
were
no
mercy
in
god
we
should
have
to
make
every
kind
of
effort
after
virtue
we
must
say
on
the
contrary
that
it
is
because
there
is
mercy
in
god
that
we
must
make
every
kind
of
effort
it
is
true
there
is
difficulty
in
entering
into
godliness
but
this
difficulty
does
not
arise
from
the
religion
which
begins
in
us
but
from
the
irreligion
which
is
still
there
if
our
senses
were
not
opposed
to
penitence
and
if
our
corruption
were
not
opposed
to
the
purity
of
god
there
would
be
nothing
in
this
painful
to
us
we
suffer
only
in
proportion
as
the
vice
which
is
natural
to
us
resists
supernatural
grace
our
heart
feels
torn
asunder
between
these
opposed
efforts
but
it
would
be
very
unfair
to
impute
this
violence
to
god
who
is
drawing
us
on
instead
of
to
the
world
which
is
holding
us
back
it
is
as
a
child
which
a
mother
tears
from
the
arms
of
robbers
in
the
pain
it
suffers
should
love
the
loving
and
legitimate
violence
of
her
who
procures
its
liberty
and
detest
only
the
impetuous
and
tyrannical
violence
of
those
who
detain
it
unjustly
the
most
cruel
war
which
god
can
make
with
men
in
this
life
is
to
leave
them
without
that
war
which
he
came
to
bring
i
came
to
send
war
he
says
and
to
teach
them
of
this
war
i
came
to
bring
fire
and
the
sword
before
him
the
world
lived
in
this
false
peace
there
is
nothing
so
perilous
as
what
pleases
god
and
man
for
those
states
which
please
god
and
man
have
one
property
which
pleases
god
and
another
which
pleases
men
as
the
greatness
of
saint
teresa
what
pleased
god
was
her
deep
humility
in
the
midst
of
her
revelations
what
pleased
men
was
her
light
and
so
we
torment
ourselves
to
imitate
her
discourses
thinking
to
imitate
her
conditions
and
not
so
much
to
love
what
god
loves
and
to
put
ourselves
in
the
state
which
god
loves
it
is
better
not
to
fast
and
thereby
humbled
than
to
fast
and
be
therewith
the
pharisee
and
the
publican
what
use
will
memory
be
to
me
if
it
can
alike
hurt
and
help
me
and
all
depends
upon
the
blessing
of
god
who
gives
only
to
things
done
for
him
according
to
his
rules
and
in
his
ways
the
manner
being
as
important
as
the
thing
and
perhaps
more
since
god
can
bring
forth
good
out
of
evil
and
without
god
we
bring
forth
evil
out
of
good
the
meaning
of
the
words
good
and
evil
first
step
to
be
blamed
for
doing
evil
and
praised
for
doing
good
second
step
to
be
neither
praised
nor
blamed
abraham
took
nothing
for
himself
but
only
for
his
servants
so
the
righteous
man
takes
for
himself
nothing
of
the
world
nor
the
applause
of
the
world
but
only
for
his
passions
which
he
uses
as
their
master
saying
to
the
one
go
and
to
another
come
te
erit
appetitus
the
passions
thus
subdued
are
virtues
even
god
attributes
to
himself
avarice
jealousy
anger
and
these
are
virtues
as
well
as
kindness
pity
constancy
which
are
also
passions
we
must
employ
them
as
slaves
and
leaving
to
them
their
food
prevent
the
soul
from
taking
any
of
it
for
when
the
passions
become
masters
they
are
vices
and
they
give
their
nutriment
to
the
soul
and
the
soul
nourishes
itself
upon
it
and
is
poisoned
philosophers
have
consecrated
the
vices
by
placing
them
in
god
himself
christians
have
consecrated
the
virtues
the
just
man
acts
by
faith
in
the
least
things
when
he
reproves
his
servants
he
desires
their
conversion
by
the
spirit
of
god
and
prays
god
to
correct
them
and
he
expects
as
much
from
god
as
from
his
own
reproofs
and
prays
god
to
bless
his
corrections
and
so
in
all
his
other
actions
he
proceeds
with
the
spirit
of
god
and
his
actions
deceive
us
by
reason
of
the
or
suspension
of
the
spirit
of
god
in
him
and
he
repents
in
his
affliction
all
things
can
be
deadly
to
us
even
the
things
made
to
serve
us
as
in
nature
walls
can
kill
us
and
stairs
can
kill
us
if
we
do
not
walk
circumspectly
the
least
movement
affects
all
nature
the
entire
sea
changes
because
of
a
rock
thus
in
grace
the
least
action
affects
everything
by
its
consequences
therefore
everything
is
important
in
each
action
we
must
look
beyond
the
action
at
our
past
present
and
future
state
and
at
others
whom
it
affects
and
see
the
relations
of
all
those
things
and
then
we
shall
be
very
cautious
let
god
not
impute
to
us
our
sins
that
is
to
say
all
the
consequences
and
results
of
our
sins
which
are
dreadful
even
those
of
the
smallest
faults
if
we
wish
to
follow
them
out
mercilessly
the
spirit
of
grace
the
hardness
of
the
heart
external
circumstances
grace
is
indeed
needed
to
turn
a
man
into
a
saint
and
he
who
doubts
it
does
not
know
what
a
saint
or
a
man
is
a
fine
thing
to
cry
to
a
man
who
does
not
know
himself
that
he
should
come
of
himself
to
god
and
a
fine
thing
to
say
so
to
a
man
who
does
know
himself
man
is
not
worthy
of
god
but
he
is
not
incapable
of
being
made
worthy
it
is
unworthy
of
god
to
unite
himself
to
wretched
man
but
it
is
not
unworthy
of
god
to
pull
him
out
of
his
misery
if
we
would
say
that
man
is
too
insignificant
to
deserve
communion
with
god
we
must
indeed
be
very
great
to
judge
of
it
it
is
in
peculiar
phraseology
wholly
the
body
of
jesus
christ
but
it
can
not
be
said
to
be
the
whole
body
of
jesus
christ
the
union
of
two
things
without
change
does
not
enable
us
to
say
that
one
becomes
the
other
the
soul
thus
being
united
to
the
body
the
fire
to
the
timber
without
change
but
change
is
necessary
to
make
the
form
of
the
one
become
the
form
of
the
other
thus
the
union
of
the
word
to
man
because
my
body
without
my
soul
would
not
make
the
body
of
a
man
therefore
my
soul
united
to
any
matter
whatsoever
will
make
my
body
it
does
not
distinguish
the
necessary
condition
from
the
sufficient
condition
the
union
is
necessary
but
not
sufficient
the
left
arm
is
not
the
right
impenetrability
is
a
property
of
matter
identity
in
regard
to
the
same
time
requires
the
identity
of
matter
thus
if
god
united
my
soul
to
a
body
in
china
the
same
body
would
be
in
china
the
same
river
which
runs
there
is
as
that
which
runs
at
the
same
time
in
china
why
god
has
established
prayer
to
communicate
to
his
creatures
the
dignity
of
causality
to
teach
us
from
whom
our
virtue
comes
to
make
us
deserve
other
virtues
by
work
but
to
keep
his
own
he
grants
prayer
to
whom
he
pleases
objection
but
we
believe
that
we
hold
prayer
of
ourselves
this
is
absurd
for
since
though
having
faith
we
can
not
have
virtues
how
should
we
have
faith
is
there
a
greater
distance
between
infidelity
and
faith
than
between
faith
and
virtue
this
word
is
ambiguous

that
strength
would
be
taken
away
from
the
righteous
but
it
is
by
chance
that
he
said
it
for
it
might
have
happened
that
the
occasion
of
saying
it
did
not
present
itself
but
his
principles
make
us
see
that
when
the
occasion
for
it
presented
itself
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
not
say
it
or
that
he
should
say
anything
to
the
contrary
it
is
then
rather
that
he
was
forced
to
say
it
when
the
occasion
presented
itself
than
that
he
said
it
when
the
occasion
presented
itself
the
one
being
of
necessity
the
other
of
chance
but
the
two
are
all
that
we
can
ask
the
elect
will
be
ignorant
of
their

that

be
pelagians
and
always
catholics
and
always
strife
because
the
first
birth
makes
the
one
and
the
grace
of
the
second
birth
the
other
the
law
imposed
what
it
did
not
give
grace
gives
what
is
imposes
all
faith
consists
in
jesus
christ
and
in
adam
and
all
morality
in
lust
and
in
grace
there
is
no
doctrine
more
appropriate
to
man
than
this
which
teaches
him
his
double
capacity
of
receiving
and
of
losing
grace
because
of
the
double
peril
to
which
he
is
exposed
of
despair
or
of
pride
the
philosophers
did
not
prescribe
feelings
suitable
to
the
two
states
they
inspired
feelings
of
pure
greatness
and
that
is
not
man
state
they
inspired
feelings
of
pure
littleness
and
that
is
not
man
state
there
must
be
feelings
of
humility
not
from
nature
but
from
penitence
not
to
rest
in
them
but
to
go
on
to
greatness
there
must
be
feelings
of
greatness
not
from
merit
but
from
grace
and
after
having
passed
through
humiliation
misery
induces
despair
pride
induces
presumption
the
incarnation
shows
man
the
greatness
of
his
misery
by
the
greatness
of
the
remedy
which
he
required
the
knowledge
of
god
without
that
of
man
misery
causes
pride
the
knowledge
of
man
misery
without
that
of
god
causes
despair
the
knowledge
of
jesus
christ
constitutes
the
middle
course
because
in
him
we
find
both
god
and
our
misery
jesus
christ
is
a
god
whom
we
approach
without
pride
and
before
whom
we
humble
ourselves
without
despair
not
a
degradation
which
renders
us
incapable
of
good
nor
a
holiness
exempt
from
evil
a
person
told
me
one
day
that
on
coming
from
confession
he
felt
great
joy
and
confidence
another
told
me
that
he
remained
in
fear
whereupon
i
thought
that
these
two
together
would
make
one
good
man
and
that
each
was
wanting
in
that
he
had
not
the
feeling
of
the
other
the
same
often
happens
in
other
things
he
who
knows
the
will
of
his
master
will
be
beaten
with
more
blows
because
of
the
power
he
has
by
his
knowledge
justus
est
justificetur
because
of
the
power
he
has
by
justice
from
him
who
has
received
most
will
the
greatest
reckoning
be
demanded
because
of
the
power
he
has
by
this
help
scripture
has
provided
passages
of
consolation
and
of
warning
for
all
conditions
nature
seems
to
have
done
the
same
thing
by
her
two
infinities
natural
and
moral
for
we
shall
always
have
the
higher
and
the
lower
the
more
clever
and
the
less
clever
the
most
exalted
and
the
meanest
in
order
to
humble
our
pride
and
exalt
our
humility
saint
paul
this
is
the
christian
character
has
named
you
i
know
you
no
corneille
that
is
the
inhuman
character
the
human
character
is
the
opposite
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
men
the
righteous
who
believe
themselves
sinners
the
rest
sinners
who
believe
themselves
righteous
we
owe
a
great
debt
to
those
who
point
out
faults
for
they
mortify
us
they
teach
us
that
we
have
been
despised
they
do
not
prevent
our
being
so
in
the
future
for
we
have
many
other
faults
for
which
we
may
be
despised
they
prepare
for
us
the
exercise
of
correction
and
freedom
from
fault
man
is
so
made
that
by
continually
telling
him
he
is
a
fool
he
believes
it
and
by
continually
telling
it
to
himself
he
makes
himself
believe
it
for
man
holds
an
inward
talk
with
his
self
alone
which
it
behoves
him
to
regulate
well
bonos
mores
colloquia
we
must
keep
silent
as
much
as
possible
and
talk
with
ourselves
only
of
god
whom
we
know
to
be
true
and
thus
we
convince
ourselves
of
the
truth
christianity
is
strange
it
bids
man
recognise
that
he
is
vile
even
abominable
and
bids
him
desire
to
be
like
god
without
such
a
counterpoise
this
dignity
would
make
him
horribly
vain
or
this
humiliation
would
make
him
terribly
abject
with
how
little
pride
does
a
christian
believe
himself
united
to
god
with
how
little
humiliation
does
he
place
himself
on
a
level
with
the
worms
of
earth
a
glorious
manner
to
welcome
life
and
death
good
and
evil
what
difference
in
point
of
obedience
is
there
between
a
soldier
and
a
carthusian
monk
for
both
are
equally
under
obedience
and
dependent
both
engaged
in
equally
painful
exercises
but
the
soldier
always
hopes
to
command
and
never
attains
this
for
even
captains
and
princes
are
ever
slaves
and
dependants
still
he
ever
hopes
and
ever
works
to
attain
this
whereas
the
carthusian
monk
makes
a
vow
to
be
always
dependent
so
they
do
not
differ
in
their
perpetual
thraldom
in
which
both
of
them
always
exist
but
in
the
hope
which
one
always
has
and
the
other
never
the
hope
which
christians
have
of
possessing
an
infinite
good
is
mingled
with
real
enjoyment
as
well
as
with
fear
for
it
is
not
as
with
those
who
should
hope
for
a
kingdom
of
which
they
being
subjects
would
have
nothing
but
they
hope
for
holiness
for
freedom
from
injustice
and
they
have
something
of
this
none
is
so
happy
as
a
true
christian
nor
so
reasonable
virtuous
or
amiable
the
christian
religion
alone
makes
man
altogether
and
in
honesty
we
can
not
perhaps
be
altogether
lovable
and
happy
the
metaphysical
proofs
of
god
are
so
remote
from
the
reasoning
of
men
and
so
complicated
that
they
make
little
impression
and
if
they
should
be
of
service
to
some
it
would
be
only
during
the
moment
that
they
see
such
demonstration
but
an
hour
afterwards
they
fear
they
have
been
mistaken
curiositate
cognoverunt
superbia
this
is
the
result
of
the
knowledge
of
god
obtained
without
jesus
christ
it
is
communion
without
a
mediator
with
the
god
whom
they
have
known
without
a
mediator
whereas
those
who
have
known
god
by
a
mediator
know
their
own
wretchedness
the
god
of
the
christians
is
a
god
who
makes
the
soul
feel
that
he
is
her
only
good
that
her
only
rest
is
in
him
that
her
only
delight
is
in
loving
him
and
who
makes
her
at
the
same
time
abhor
the
obstacles
which
keep
her
back
and
prevent
her
from
loving
god
with
all
her
strength
and
lust
which
hinder
us
are
unbearable
to
her
thus
god
makes
her
feel
that
she
has
this
root
of
which
destroys
her
and
which
he
alone
can
cure
jesus
christ
did
nothing
but
teach
men
that
they
loved
themselves
that
they
were
slaves
blind
sick
wretched
and
sinners
that
he
must
deliver
them
enlighten
bless
and
heal
them
that
this
would
be
effected
by
hating
self
and
by
following
him
through
suffering
and
the
death
on
the
cross
without
jesus
christ
man
must
be
in
vice
and
misery
with
jesus
christ
man
is
free
from
vice
and
misery
in
him
is
all
our
virtue
and
all
our
happiness
apart
from
him
there
is
but
vice
misery
darkness
death
despair
we
know
god
only
by
jesus
christ
without
this
mediator
all
communion
with
god
is
taken
away
through
jesus
christ
we
know
god
all
those
who
have
claimed
to
know
god
and
to
prove
him
without
jesus
christ
have
had
only
weak
proofs
but
in
proof
of
jesus
christ
we
have
the
prophecies
which
are
solid
and
palpable
proofs
and
these
prophecies
being
accomplished
and
proved
true
by
the
event
mark
the
certainty
of
these
truths
and
therefore
the
divinity
of
christ
in
him
then
and
through
him
we
know
god
apart
from
him
and
without
the
scripture
without
original
sin
without
a
necessary
mediator
promised
and
come
we
can
not
absolutely
prove
god
nor
teach
right
doctrine
and
right
morality
but
through
jesus
christ
and
in
jesus
christ
we
prove
god
and
teach
morality
and
doctrine
jesus
christ
is
then
the
true
god
of
men
but
we
know
at
the
same
time
our
wretchedness
for
this
god
is
none
other
than
the
saviour
of
our
wretchedness
so
we
can
only
know
god
well
by
knowing
our
iniquities
therefore
those
who
have
known
god
without
knowing
their
wretchedness
have
not
glorified
him
but
have
glorified
themselves
non

not
only
do
we
know
god
by
jesus
christ
alone
but
we
know
ourselves
only
by
jesus
christ
we
know
life
and
death
only
through
jesus
christ
apart
from
jesus
christ
we
do
not
know
what
is
our
life
nor
our
death
nor
god
nor
ourselves
thus
without
the
scripture
which
has
jesus
christ
alone
for
its
object
we
know
nothing
and
see
only
darkness
and
confusion
in
the
nature
of
god
and
in
our
own
nature
it
is
not
only
impossible
but
useless
to
know
god
without
jesus
christ
they
have
not
departed
from
him
but
approached
they
have
not
humbled
themselves
but

i

i
try

sincere
and
faithful
to

i
have
a

for
those
to
whom

has

whether
i
am

i
do
all
my
actions
in
the
sight
of

who
must
judge
of
them
and
to
whom
i
have
consecrated

all
these
are
my
sentiments
and
every
day
of
my
life
i
bless
my
redeemer
who
has
implanted
them
in
me

who
of
a
man
full
of
weakness
of
miseries
of
lust
of
pride
and
of
ambition
has
made
a
man
free
from
all
these
evils
by
the
power
of
his
grace
to
which
all
the
glory
of
it
is
due
as
of
myself

sepulchre
of
jesus
jesus
christ
was
dead
but
seen
on
the
cross
he
was
dead
and
hidden
in
the
sepulchre
jesus
christ
was
buried
by
the
saints
alone
jesus
christ
wrought
no
miracle
at
the
sepulchre
only
the
saints
entered
it
it
is
there
not
on
the
cross
that
jesus
christ
takes
a
new
life
it
is
the
last
mystery
of
the
passion
and
the
redemption
jesus
christ
had
nowhere
to
rest
on
earth
but
in
the
sepulchre
his
enemies
only
ceased
to
persecute
him
at
the
sepulchre
mystery
of
jesus
suffers
in
his
passions
the
torments
which
men
inflict
upon
him
but
in
his
agony
he
suffers
the
torments
which
he
inflicts
on
himself
this
is
a
suffering
from
no
human
but
an
almighty
hand
for
he
must
be
almighty
to
bear
it
jesus
seeks
some
comfort
at
least
in
his
three
dearest
friends
and
they
are
asleep
he
prays
them
to
bear
with
him
for
a
little
and
they
leave
him
with
entire
indifference
having
so
little
compassion
that
it
could
not
prevent
their
sleeping
even
for
a
moment
and
thus
jesus
was
left
alone
to
the
wrath
of
god
jesus
is
alone
on
the
earth
without
any
one
not
only
to
feel
and
share
his
suffering
but
even
to
know
of
it
he
and
heaven
were
alone
in
that
knowledge
jesus
is
in
a
garden
not
of
delight
as
the
first
adam
where
he
lost
himself
and
the
whole
human
race
but
in
one
of
agony
where
he
saved
himself
and
the
whole
human
race
he
suffers
this
affliction
and
this
desertion
in
the
horror
of
night
i
believe
that
jesus
never
complained
but
on
this
single
occasion
but
then
he
complained
as
if
he
could
no
longer
bear
his
extreme
suffering
my
soul
is
sorrowful
even
unto
death
jesus
seeks
companionship
and
comfort
from
men
this
is
the
sole
occasion
in
all
his
life
as
it
seems
to
me
but
he
receives
it
not
for
his
disciples
are
asleep
jesus
will
be
in
agony
even
to
the
end
of
the
world
we
must
not
sleep
during
that
time
jesus
in
the
midst
of
this
universal
desertion
including
that
of
his
own
friends
chosen
to
watch
with
him
finding
them
asleep
is
vexed
because
of
the
danger
to
which
they
expose
not
him
but
themselves
he
cautions
them
for
their
own
safety
and
their
own
good
with
a
sincere
tenderness
for
them
during
their
ingratitude
and
warns
them
that
the
spirit
is
willing
and
the
flesh
weak
jesus
finding
them
still
asleep
without
being
restrained
by
any
consideration
for
themselves
or
for
him
has
the
kindness
not
to
waken
them
and
leaves
them
in
repose
jesus
prays
uncertain
of
the
will
of
his
father
and
fears
death
but
when
he
knows
it
he
goes
forward
to
offer
himself
to
death
john
jesus
asked
of
men
and
was
not
heard
jesus
while
his
disciples
slept
wrought
their
salvation
he
has
wrought
that
of
each
of
the
righteous
while
they
slept
both
in
their
nothingness
before
their
birth
and
in
their
sins
after
their
birth
he
prays
only
once
that
the
cup
pass
away
and
then
with
submission
and
twice
that
it
come
if
necessary
jesus
is
weary
jesus
seeing
all
his
friends
asleep
and
all
his
enemies
wakeful
commits
himself
entirely
to
his
father
jesus
does
not
regard
in
judas
his
enmity
but
the
order
of
god
which
he
loves
and
admits
since
he
calls
him
friend
jesus
tears
himself
away
from
his
disciples
to
enter
into
his
agony
we
must
tear
ourselves
away
from
our
nearest
and
dearest
to
imitate
him
jesus
being
in
agony
and
in
the
greatest
affliction
let
us
pray
longer
we
implore
the
mercy
of
god
not
that
he
may
leave
us
at
peace
in
our
vices
but
that
he
may
deliver
us
from
them
if
god
gave
us
masters
by
his
own
hand
oh
how
necessary
for
us
to
obey
them
with
a
good
heart
necessity
and
events
follow
infallibly
console
thyself
thou
wouldst
not
seek
me
if
thou
hadst
not
found
me
i
thought
of
thee
in
mine
agony
i
have
sweated
such
drops
of
blood
for
thee
it
is
tempting
me
rather
than
proving
thyself
to
think
if
thou
wouldst
do
such
and
such
a
thing
on
an
occasion
which
has
not
happened
i
shall
act
in
thee
if
it
occur
let
thyself
be
guided
by
my
rules
see
how
well
i
have
led
the
virgin
and
the
saints
who
have
let
me
act
in
them
the
father
loves
all
that
i
do
dost
thou
wish
that
it
always
cost
me
the
blood
of
my
humanity
without
thy
shedding
tears
thy
conversion
is
my
affair
fear
not
and
pray
with
confidence
as
for
me
i
am
present
with
thee
by
my
word
in
scripture
by
my
spirit
in
the
church
and
by
inspiration
by
my
power
in
the
priests
by
my
prayer
in
the
faithful
physicians
will
not
heal
thee
for
thou
wilt
die
at
last
but
it
is
i
who
heal
thee
and
make
the
body
immortal
suffer
bodily
chains
and
servitude
i
deliver
thee
at
present
only
from
spiritual
servitude
i
am
more
a
friend
to
thee
than
such
and
such
an
one
for
i
have
done
for
thee
more
than
they
they
would
not
have
suffered
what
i
have
suffered
from
thee
and
they
would
not
have
died
for
thee
as
i
have
done
in
the
time
of
thine
infidelities
and
cruelties
and
as
i
am
ready
to
do
and
do
among
my
elect
and
at
the
holy
sacrament
if
thou
knewest
thy
sins
thou
wouldst
lose
heart
i
shall
lose
it
then
lord
for
on
thy
assurance
i
believe
their
malice
no
for
i
by
whom
thou
learnest
can
heal
thee
of
them
and
what
i
say
to
thee
is
a
sign
that
i
will
heal
thee
in
proportion
to
thy
expiation
of
them
thou
wilt
know
them
and
it
will
be
said
to
thee
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
repent
then
for
thy
hidden
sins
and
for
the
secret
malice
of
those
which
thou
knowest
lord
i
give
thee
all
i

thou

thee
worm
of

ask
thy
confessor
when
my
own
words
are
to
thee
occasion
of
evil
vanity
or
curiosity
i
see
in
me
depths
of
pride
curiosity
and
lust
there
is
no
relation
between
me
and
god
nor
jesus
christ
the
righteous
but
he
has
been
made
sin
for
me
all
thy
scourges
are
fallen
upon
him
he
is
more
abominable
than
i
and
far
from
abhorring
me
he
holds
himself
honoured
that
i
go
to
him
and
succour
him
but
he
has
healed
himself
and
still
more
so
will
he
heal
me
i
must
add
my
wounds
to
his
and
join
myself
to
him
and
he
will
save
me
in
saving
himself
but
this
must
not
be
postponed
to
the
future
sicut

each
one
creates
his
god
when
judging
this
is
good
or
bad
and
men
mourn
or
rejoice
too
much
at
events
do
little
things
as
though
they
were
great
because
of
the
majesty
of
jesus
christ
who
does
them
in
us
and
who
lives
our
life
and
do
the
greatest
things
as
though
they
were
little
and
easy
because
of
his
omnipotence
it
seems
to
me
that
jesus
christ
only
allowed
his
wounds
to
be
touched
after
his
resurrection
me
we
must
unite
ourselves
only
to
his
sufferings
at
the
last
supper
he
gave
himself
in
communion
as
about
to
die
to
the

at

as
risen
from

to
the
whole

as

compare
not
thyself

with
me
if
thou
dost
not
find
me
in
those
with
whom
thou
comparest

thou
comparest
thyself
to
one
who
is
abominable
if
thou
findest
me
in
them
compare
thyself
to
me
but
whom
wilt
thou
compare
thyself

me
in
thee
if
it

it
is

if
it

thou

now
i
am

in
all
i
speak
to
thee
and
often
counsel
thee
because
thy
director
can
not
speak
to
thee
for
i
do
not
want
thee
to
lack
a
guide
and
perhaps
i
do
so
at
his
prayers
and
thus
he
leads
thee
without
thy
seeing

thou
wouldst
not
seek

if
thou
didst

therefore
troubled
section
viii
the
fundamentals
of
the
christian
religion
men
blaspheme
what
they
do
not
know
the
christian
religion
consists
in
two
points
it
is
of
equal
concern
to
men
to
know
them
and
it
is
equally
dangerous
to
be
ignorant
to
them
and
it
is
equally
of
mercy
that
he
has
given
indications
of
both
and
yet
they
take
occasion
to
conclude
that
one
of
these
points
does
not
exist
from
that
which
should
have
caused
them
to
infer
the
other
the
sages
who
have
said
there
is
only
one
god
have
been
persecuted
the
jews
were
hated
and
still
more
the
christians
they
have
seen
by
the
light
of
nature
that
if
there
be
a
true
religion
on
earth
the
course
of
all
things
must
tend
to
it
as
to
a
centre
the
whole
course
of
things
must
have
for
its
object
the
establishment
and
the
greatness
of
religion
men
must
have
within
them
feelings
suited
to
what
religion
teaches
us
and
finally
religion
must
so
be
the
object
and
centre
to
which
all
things
tend
that
whoever
knows
the
principles
of
religion
can
give
an
explanation
both
of
the
whole
nature
of
man
in
particular
and
of
the
whole
course
of
the
world
in
general
and
on
this
ground
they
take
occasion
to
revile
the
christian
religion
because
they
misunderstand
it
they
imagine
that
it
consists
simply
in
the
worship
of
a
god
considered
as
great
powerful
and
eternal
which
is
strictly
deism
almost
as
far
removed
from
the
christian
religion
as
atheism
which
is
its
exact
opposite
and
thence
they
conclude
that
this
religion
is
not
true
because
they
do
not
see
that
all
things
concur
to
the
establishment
of
this
point
that
god
does
not
manifest
himself
to
men
with
all
the
evidence
which
he
could
show
but
let
them
conclude
what
they
will
against
deism
they
will
conclude
nothing
against
the
christian
religion
which
properly
consists
in
the
mystery
of
the
redeemer
who
uniting
in
himself
the
two
natures
human
and
divine
has
redeemed
men
from
the
corruption
of
sin
in
order
to
reconcile
them
in
his
divine
person
to
god
the
christian
religion
then
teaches
men
these
two
truths
that
there
is
a
god
whom
men
can
know
and
that
there
is
a
corruption
in
their
nature
which
renders
them
unworthy
of
him
it
is
equally
important
to
men
to
know
both
these
points
and
it
is
equally
dangerous
for
man
to
know
god
without
knowing
his
own
wretchedness
and
to
know
his
own
wretchedness
without
knowing
the
redeemer
who
can
free
him
from
it
the
knowledge
of
only
one
of
these
points
gives
rise
either
to
the
pride
of
philosophers
who
have
known
god
and
not
their
own
wretchedness
or
to
the
despair
of
atheists
who
know
their
own
wretchedness
but
not
the
redeemer
and
as
it
is
alike
necessary
to
man
to
know
these
two
points
so
is
it
alike
merciful
of
god
to
have
made
us
know
them
the
christian
religion
does
this
it
is
in
this
that
it
consists
let
us
herein
examine
the
order
of
the
world
and
see
if
all
things
do
not
tend
to
establish
these
two
chief
points
of
this
religion
jesus
christ
is
the
end
of
all
and
the
centre
to
which
all
tends
whoever
knows
him
knows
the
reason
of
everything
those
who
fall
into
error
err
only
through
failure
to
see
one
of
these
two
things
we
can
then
have
an
excellent
knowledge
of
god
without
that
of
our
own
wretchedness
and
of
our
own
wretchedness
without
that
of
god
but
we
can
not
know
jesus
christ
without
knowing
at
the
same
time
both
god
and
our
own
wretchedness
therefore
i
shall
not
undertake
here
to
prove
by
natural
reasons
either
the
existence
of
god
or
the
trinity
or
the
immortality
of
the
soul
or
anything
of
that
nature
not
only
because
i
should
not
feel
myself
sufficiently
able
to
find
in
nature
arguments
to
convince
hardened
atheists
but
also
because
such
knowledge
without
jesus
christ
is
useless
and
barren
though
a
man
should
be
convinced
that
numerical
proportions
are
immaterial
truths
eternal
and
dependent
on
a
first
truth
in
which
they
subsist
and
which
is
called
god
i
should
not
think
him
far
advanced
towards
his
own
salvation
the
god
of
christians
is
not
a
god
who
is
simply
the
author
of
mathematical
truths
or
of
the
order
of
the
elements
that
is
the
view
of
heathens
and
epicureans
he
is
not
merely
a
god
who
exercises
his
providence
over
the
life
and
fortunes
of
men
to
bestow
on
those
who
worship
him
a
long
and
happy
life
that
was
the
portion
of
the
jews
but
the
god
of
abraham
the
god
of
isaac
the
god
of
jacob
the
god
of
christians
is
a
god
of
love
and
of
comfort
a
god
who
fills
the
soul
and
heart
of
those
whom
he
possesses
a
god
who
makes
them
conscious
of
their
inward
wretchedness
and
his
infinite
mercy
who
unites
himself
to
their
inmost
soul
who
fills
it
with
humility
and
joy
with
confidence
and
love
who
renders
them
incapable
of
any
other
end
than
himself
all
who
seek
god
without
jesus
christ
and
who
rest
in
nature
either
find
no
light
to
satisfy
them
or
come
to
form
for
themselves
a
means
of
knowing
god
and
serving
him
without
a
mediator
thereby
they
fall
either
into
atheism
or
into
deism
two
things
which
the
christian
religion
abhors
almost
equally
without
jesus
christ
the
world
would
not
exist
for
it
should
needs
be
either
that
it
would
be
destroyed
or
be
a
hell
if
the
world
existed
to
instruct
man
of
god
his
divinity
would
shine
through
every
part
in
it
in
an
indisputable
manner
but
as
it
exists
only
by
jesus
christ
and
for
jesus
christ
and
to
teach
men
both
their
corruption
and
their
redemption
all
displays
the
proofs
of
these
two
truths
all
appearance
indicates
neither
a
total
exclusion
nor
a
manifest
presence
of
divinity
but
the
presence
of
a
god
who
hides
himself
everything
bears
this
character
shall
he
alone
who
knows
his
nature
know
it
only
to
be
miserable
shall
he
alone
who
knows
it
be
alone
unhappy
he
must
not
see
nothing
at
all
nor
must
he
see
sufficient
for
him
to
believe
he
possesses
it
but
he
must
see
enough
to
know
that
he
has
lost
it
for
to
know
of
his
loss
he
must
see
and
not
see
and
that
is
exactly
the
state
in
which
he
naturally
is
whatever
part
he
takes
i
shall
not
leave
him
at
rest
it
is
then
true
that
everything
teaches
man
his
condition
but
he
must
understand
this
well
for
it
is
not
true
that
all
reveals
god
and
it
is
not
true
that
all
conceals
god
but
it
is
at
the
same
time
true
that
he
hides
himself
from
those
who
tempt
him
and
that
he
reveals
himself
to
those
who
seek
him
because
men
are
both
unworthy
and
capable
of
god
unworthy
by
their
corruption
capable
by
their
original
nature
what
shall
we
conclude
from
all
our
darkness
but
our
unworthiness
if
there
never
had
been
any
appearance
of
god
this
eternal
deprivation
would
have
been
equivocal
and
might
have
as
well
corresponded
with
the
absence
of
all
divinity
as
with
the
unworthiness
of
men
to
know
him
but
his
occasional
though
not
continual
appearances
remove
the
ambiguity
if
he
appeared
once
he
exists
always
and
thus
we
can
not
but
conclude
both
that
there
is
a
god
and
that
men
are
unworthy
of
him
we
do
not
understand
the
glorious
state
of
adam
nor
the
nature
of
his
sin
nor
the
transmission
of
it
to
us
these
are
matters
which
took
place
under
conditions
of
a
nature
altogether
different
from
our
own
and
which
transcend
our
present
understanding
the
knowledge
of
all
this
is
useless
to
us
as
a
means
of
escape
from
it
and
all
that
we
are
concerned
to
know
is
that
we
are
miserable
corrupt
separated
from
god
but
ransomed
by
jesus
christ
whereof
we
have
wonderful
proofs
on
earth
so
the
two
proofs
of
corruption
and
redemption
are
drawn
from
the
ungodly
who
live
in
indifference
to
religion
and
from
the
jews
who
are
irreconcilable
enemies
there
are
two
ways
of
proving
the
truths
of
our
religion
one
by
the
power
of
reason
the
other
by
the
authority
of
him
who
speaks
we
do
not
make
use
of
the
latter
but
of
the
former
we
do
not
say
this
must
be
believed
for
scripture
which
says
it
is
divine
but
we
say
that
it
must
be
believed
for
such
and
such
a
reason
which
are
feeble
arguments
as
reason
may
be
bent
to
everything
there
is
nothing
on
earth
that
does
not
show
either
the
wretchedness
of
man
or
the
mercy
of
god
either
the
weakness
of
man
without
god
or
the
strength
of
man
with
god
it
will
be
one
of
the
confusions
of
the
damned
to
see
that
they
are
condemned
by
their
own
reason
by
which
they
claimed
to
condemn
the
christian
religion
the
prophecies
the
very
miracles
and
proofs
of
our
religion
are
not
of
such
a
nature
that
they
can
be
said
to
be
absolutely
convincing
but
they
are
also
of
such
a
kind
that
it
can
not
be
said
that
it
is
unreasonable
to
believe
them
thus
there
is
both
evidence
and
obscurity
to
enlighten
some
and
confuse
others
but
the
evidence
is
such
that
it
surpasses
or
at
least
equals
the
evidence
to
the
contrary
so
that
it
is
not
reason
which
can
determine
men
not
to
follow
it
and
thus
it
can
only
be
lust
or
malice
of
heart
and
by
this
means
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
condemn
and
insufficient
to
convince
so
that
it
appears
in
those
who
follow
it
that
it
is
grace
and
not
reason
which
makes
them
follow
it
and
in
those
who
shun
it
that
it
is
lust
not
reason
which
makes
them
shun
it
discipuli
vere
israëlita
vere
liberi
vere
recognise
then
the
truth
of
religion
in
the
very
obscurity
of
religion
in
the
little
light
we
have
of
it
and
in
the
indifference
which
we
have
to
knowing
it
we
understand
nothing
of
the
works
of
god
if
we
do
not
take
as
a
principle
that
he
has
willed
to
blind
some
and
enlighten
others
the
two
contrary
reasons
we
must
begin
with
that
without
that
we
understand
nothing
and
all
is
heretical
and
we
must
even
add
at
the
end
of
each
truth
that
the
opposite
truth
is
to
be
remembered
the
scripture
is
plainly
full
of
matters
not
dictated
by
the
holy
then
they
do
not
harm
but
the
church
has
decided
that
all
is
of
the
holy
i
answer
two
things
first
the
church
has
not
so
decided
secondly
if
she
should
so
decide
it
could
be
maintained
do
you
think
that
the
prophecies
cited
in
the
gospel
are
related
to
make
you
believe
no
it
is
to
keep
you
from
believing
the
heretical
books
in
the
beginning
of
the
church
serve
to
prove
the
canonical
to
the
chapter
on
the
must
be
added
that
on
touching
the
reason
of
types
why
jesus
christ
was
prophesied
as
to
his
first
coming
why
prophesied
obscurely
as
to
the
manner
reason
why
they
had
to
deal
with
a
carnal
people
and
to
render
them
the
depositary
of
the
spiritual
covenant
to
give
faith
to
the
messiah
it
was
necessary
there
should
have
been
precedent
prophecies
and
that
these
should
be
conveyed
by
persons
above
suspicion
diligent
faithful
unusually
zealous
and
known
to
all
the
world
to
accomplish
all
this
god
chose
this
carnal
people
to
whom
he
entrusted
the
prophecies
which
foretell
the
messiah
as
a
deliverer
and
as
a
dispenser
of
those
carnal
goods
which
this
people
loved
and
thus
they
have
had
an
extraordinary
passion
for
their
prophets
and
in
sight
of
the
whole
world
have
had
charge
of
these
books
which
foretell
their
messiah
assuring
all
nations
that
he
should
come
and
in
the
way
foretold
in
the
books
which
they
held
open
to
the
whole
world
yet
this
people
deceived
by
the
poor
and
ignominious
advent
of
the
messiah
have
been
his
most
cruel
enemies
so
that
they
the
people
least
open
to
suspicion
in
the
world
of
favouring
us
the
most
strict
and
most
zealous
that
can
be
named
for
their
law
and
their
prophets
have
kept
the
books
incorrupt
hence
those
who
have
rejected
and
crucified
jesus
christ
who
has
been
to
them
an
offence
are
those
who
have
charge
of
the
books
which
testify
of
him
and
state
that
he
will
be
an
offence
and
rejected
therefore
they
have
shown
it
was
he
by
rejecting
him
and
he
has
been
alike
proved
both
by
the
righteous
jews
who
received
him
and
by
the
unrighteous
who
rejected
him
both
facts
having
been
foretold
wherefore
the
prophecies
have
a
hidden
and
spiritual
meaning
to
which
this
people
were
hostile
under
the
carnal
meaning
which
they
loved
if
the
spiritual
meaning
had
been
revealed
they
would
not
have
loved
it
and
unable
to
bear
it
they
would
not
have
been
zealous
of
the
preservation
of
their
books
and
their
ceremonies
and
if
they
had
loved
these
spiritual
promises
and
had
preserved
them
incorrupt
till
the
time
of
the
messiah
their
testimony
would
have
had
no
force
because
they
had
been
his
friends
therefore
it
was
well
that
the
spiritual
meaning
should
be
concealed
but
on
the
other
hand
if
this
meaning
had
been
so
hidden
as
not
to
appear
at
all
it
could
not
have
served
as
a
proof
of
the
messiah
what
then
was
done
in
a
crowd
of
passages
it
has
been
hidden
under
the
temporal
meaning
and
in
a
few
has
been
clearly
revealed
besides
that
the
time
and
the
state
of
the
world
have
been
so
clearly
foretold
that
it
is
clearer
than
the
sun
and
in
some
places
this
spiritual
meaning
is
so
clearly
expressed
that
it
would
require
a
blindness
like
that
which
the
flesh
imposes
on
the
spirit
when
it
is
subdued
by
it
not
to
recognise
it
see
then
what
has
been
the
prudence
of
god
this
meaning
is
concealed
under
another
in
an
infinite
number
of
passages
and
in
some
though
rarely
it
is
revealed
but
yet
so
that
the
passages
in
which
it
is
concealed
are
equivocal
and
can
suit
both
meanings
whereas
the
passages
where
it
is
disclosed
are
unequivocal
and
can
only
suit
the
spiritual
meaning
so
that
this
can
not
lead
us
into
error
and
could
only
be
misunderstood
by
so
carnal
a
people
for
when
blessings
are
promised
in
abundance
what
was
to
prevent
them
from
understanding
the
true
blessings
but
their
covetousness
which
limited
the
meaning
to
worldly
goods
but
those
whose
only
good
was
in
god
referred
them
to
god
alone
for
there
are
two
principles
which
divide
the
wills
of
men
covetousness
and
charity
not
that
covetousness
can
not
exist
along
with
faith
in
god
nor
charity
with
worldly
riches
but
covetousness
uses
god
and
enjoys
the
world
and
charity
is
the
opposite
now
the
ultimate
end
gives
names
to
things
all
which
prevents
us
from
attaining
it
is
called
an
enemy
to
us
thus
the
creatures
however
good
are
the
enemies
of
the
righteous
when
they
turn
them
away
from
god
and
god
himself
is
the
enemy
of
those
whose
covetousness
he
confounds
thus
as
the
significance
of
the
word
enemy
is
dependent
on
the
ultimate
end
the
righteous
understood
by
it
their
passions
and
the
carnal
the
babylonians
and
so
these
terms
were
obscure
only
for
the
unrighteous
and
this
is
what
isaiah
says
legem
in
electis
and
that
jesus
christ
shall
be
a
stone
of
stumbling
but
blessed
are
they
who
shall
not
be
offended
in
him
hosea
says
excellently
where
is
the
wise
and
he
shall
understand
what
i
say
the
righteous
shall
know
them
for
the
ways
of
god
are
right
but
the
transgressors
shall
fall
therein
hypothesis
that
the
apostles
were

time

five
typical
proofs
prophets
scattered
of
the
scripture
said
the
jews
says
that
we
shall
not

whence

will
come
john
vii
and
xii
the
scripture
says
that
christ
abideth
for
ever
and
he
said
that
he
should
die
therefore
says
saint
john
they
believed
not
though
he
had
done
so
many
miracles
that
the
word
of
isaiah
might
be
fulfilled
he
hath
blinded
them
etc
religion
is
so
great
a
thing
that
it
is
right
that
those
who
will
not
take
the
trouble
to
seek
it
if
it
be
obscure
should
be
deprived
of
it
why
then
do
any
complain
if
it
be
such
as
can
be
found
by
seeking
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
the
elect
even
the
obscurities
of
scripture
for
they
honour
them
because
of
what
is
divinely
clear
and
all
things
work
together
for
evil
to
the
rest
of
the
world
even
what
is
clear
for
they
revile
such
because
of
the
obscurities
which
they
do
not
understand
general
conduct
of
the
world
towards
the
church
god
willing
to
blind
and
to
the
event
having
proved
the
divinity
of
these
prophecies
the
rest
ought
to
be
believed
and
thereby
we
see
the
order
of
the
world
to
be
of
this
kind
the
miracles
of
the
creation
and
the
deluge
being
forgotten
god
sends
the
law
and
the
miracles
of
moses
the
prophets
who
prophesied
particular
things
and
to
prepare
a
lasting
miracle
he
prepares
prophecies
and
their
fulfilment
but
as
the
prophecies
could
be
suspected
he
desires
to
make
them
above
suspicion
etc
god
has
made
the
blindness
of
this
people
subservient
to
the
good
of
the
elect
there
is
sufficient
clearness
to
enlighten
the
elect
and
sufficient
obscurity
to
humble
them
there
is
sufficient
obscurity
to
blind
the
reprobate
and
sufficient
clearness
to
condemn
them
and
make
them
saint
augustine
montaigne
sébond
the
genealogy
of
jesus
christ
in
the
old
testament
is
intermingled
with
so
many
others
that
are
useless
that
it
can
not
be
distinguished
if
moses
had
kept
only
the
record
of
the
ancestors
of
christ
that
might
have
been
too
plain
if
he
had
not
noted
that
of
jesus
christ
it
might
not
have
been
sufficiently
plain
but
after
all
whoever
looks
closely
sees
that
of
jesus
christ
expressly
traced
through
tamar
ruth
etc
those
who
ordained
these
sacrifices
knew
their
uselessness
those
who
have
declared
their
uselessness
have
not
ceased
to
practise
them
if
god
had
permitted
only
one
religion
it
had
been
too
easily
known
but
when
we
look
at
it
closely
we
clearly
discern
the
truth
amidst
this
confusion
moses
was
a
clever
man
if
then
he
ruled
himself
by
his
reason
he
would
say
nothing
clearly
which
was
directly
against
reason
thus
all
the
very
apparent
weaknesses
are
strength
example
the
two
genealogies
in
saint
matthew
and
saint
luke
what
can
be
clearer
than
that
this
was
not
concerted
god
and
the
apostles
foreseeing
that
the
seeds
of
pride
would
make
heresies
spring
up
and
being
unwilling
to
give
them
occasion
to
arise
from
correct
expressions
has
put
in
scripture
and
the
prayers
of
the
church
contrary
words
and
sentences
to
produce
their
fruit
in
time
so
in
morals
he
gives
charity
which
produces
fruits
contrary
to
lust
nature
has
some
perfections
to
show
that
she
is
the
image
of
god
and
some
defects
to
show
that
she
is
only
his
image
god
prefers
rather
to
incline
the
will
than
the
intellect
perfect
clearness
would
be
of
use
to
the
intellect
and
would
harm
the
will
to
humble
pride
we
make
an
idol
of
truth
itself
for
truth
apart
from
charity
is
not
god
but
his
image
and
idol
which
we
must
neither
love
nor
worship
and
still
less
must
we
love
or
worship
its
opposite
namely
falsehood
i
can
easily
love
total
darkness
but
if
god
keeps
me
in
a
state
of
such
partial
darkness
displeases
me
and
because
i
do
not
see
therein
the
advantage
of
total
darkness
it
is
unpleasant
to
me
this
is
a
fault
and
a
sign
that
i
make
for
myself
an
idol
of
darkness
apart
from
the
order
of
god
now
only
his
order
must
be
worshipped
the
are
people
who
know
the
truth
but
only
affirm
it
so
far
as
consistent
with
their
own
interest
but
apart
from
that
they
renounce
it
the
world
exists
for
the
exercise
of
mercy
and
judgment
not
as
if
men
were
placed
in
it
out
of
the
hands
of
god
but
as
hostile
to
god
and
to
them
he
grants
by
grace
sufficient
light
that
they
may
return
to
him
if
they
desire
to
seek
and
follow
him
and
also
that
they
may
be
punished
if
they
refuse
to
seek
or
follow
him
god
has
willed
to
hide
if
there
were
only
one
religion
god
would
indeed
be
manifest
the
same
would
be
the
case
if
there
were
no
martyrs
but
in
our
religion
god
being
thus
hidden
every
religion
which
does
not
affirm
that
god
is
hidden
is
not
true
and
every
religion
which
does
not
give
the
reason
of
it
is
not
instructive
our
religion
does
all
this
tu
es
deus
if
there
were
no
obscurity
man
would
not
be
sensible
of
his
corruption
if
there
were
no
light
man
would
not
hope
for
a
remedy
thus
it
is
not
only
fair
but
advantageous
to
us
that
god
be
partly
hidden
and
partly
revealed
since
it
is
equally
dangerous
to
man
to
know
god
without
knowing
his
own
wretchedness
and
to
know
his
own
wretchedness
without
knowing
god
this
religion
so
great
in
miracles
saints
blameless
fathers
learned
and
great
witnesses
martyrs
established
kings
as
david
and
isaiah
a
prince
of
the
blood
and
so
great
in
science
after
having
displayed
all
her
miracles
and
all
her
wisdom
rejects
all
this
and
declares
that
she
has
neither
wisdom
nor
signs
but
only
the
cross
and
foolishness
for
those
who
by
these
signs
and
that
wisdom
have
deserved
your
belief
and
who
have
proved
to
you
their
character
declare
to
you
that
nothing
of
all
this
can
change
you
and
render
you
capable
of
knowing
and
loving
god
but
the
power
of
the
foolishness
of
the
cross
without
wisdom
and
signs
and
not
the
signs
without
this
power
thus
our
religion
is
foolish
in
respect
to
the
effective
cause
and
wise
in
respect
to
the
wisdom
which
prepares
it
our
religion
is
wise
and
foolish
wise
because
it
is
the
most
learned
and
the
most
founded
on
miracles
prophecies
etc
foolish
because
it
is
not
all
this
which
makes
us
belong
to
it
this
makes
us
indeed
condemn
those
who
do
not
belong
to
it
but
it
does
not
cause
belief
in
those
who
do
belong
to
it
it
is
the
cross
that
makes
them
believe
evacuata
sit
and
so
saint
paul
who
came
with
wisdom
and
signs
says
that
he
has
come
neither
with
wisdom
nor
with
signs
for
he
came
to
convert
but
those
who
come
only
to
convince
can
say
that
they
come
with
wisdom
and
with
signs
section
ix
perpetuity
the
fact
that
the
christian
religion
is
not
the
only
so
far
is
this
from
being
a
reason
for
believing
that
it
is
not
the
true
one
that
on
the
contrary
it
makes
us
see
that
it
is
so
men
must
be
sincere
in
all
religions
true
heathens
true
jews
true
christians
heathens
mahomet
ignorance
of
god
falseness
of
other
they
have
no
witnesses
jews
have
god
defies
other
religions
to
produce
such
signs
isaiah
xliii
xliv
of
believe
only
the
histories
whose
witnesses
got
themselves
killed
which
is
the
more
credible
of
the
two
moses
or
china
it
is
not
a
question
of
seeing
this
summarily
i
tell
you
there
is
in
it
something
to
blind
and
something
to
enlighten
by
this
one
word
i
destroy
all
your
reasoning
but
china
obscures
say
you
and
i
answer
china
obscures
but
there
is
clearness
to
be
found
seek
it
thus
all
that
you
say
makes
for
one
of
the
views
and
not
at
all
against
the
other
so
this
serves
and
does
no
harm
we
must
then
see
this
in
detail
we
must
put
the
papers
on
the
table
the
history
of
the
historians
of
mexico
the
five
suns
of
which
the
last
is
only
eight
hundred
years
old
the
difference
between
a
book
accepted
by
a
nation
and
one
which
makes
a
nation
mahomet
was
without
authority
his
reasons
then
should
have
been
very
strong
having
only
their
own
force
what
does
he
say
then
that
we
must
believe
him
the
psalms
are
chanted
throughout
the
whole
world
who
renders
testimony
to
mahomet
himself
jesus
christ
desires
his
own
testimony
to
be
as
nothing
the
quality
of
witnesses
necessitates
their
existence
always
and
everywhere
and
he
miserable
creature
is
alone
the
koran
is
not
more
of
mahomet
than
the
gospel
is
of
saint
matthew
for
it
is
cited
by
many
authors
from
age
to
age
even
its
very
enemies
celsus
and
porphyry
never
denied
it
the
koran
says
saint
matthew
was
an
honest
man
therefore
mahomet
was
a
false
prophet
for
calling
honest
men
wicked
or
for
not
agreeing
with
what
they
have
said
of
jesus
christ
it
is
not
by
that
which
is
obscure
in
mahomet
and
which
may
be
interpreted
in
a
mysterious
sense
that
i
would
have
him
judged
but
by
what
is
clear
as
his
paradise
and
the
rest
in
that
he
is
ridiculous
and
since
what
is
clear
is
ridiculous
it
is
not
right
to
take
his
obscurities
for
mysteries
it
is
not
the
same
with
the
scripture
i
agree
that
there
are
in
it
obscurities
as
strange
as
those
of
mahomet
but
there
are
admirably
clear
passages
and
the
prophecies
are
manifestly
fulfilled
the
cases
are
therefore
not
on
a
par
we
must
not
confound
and
put
on
one
level
things
which
only
resemble
each
other
in
their
obscurity
and
not
in
the
clearness
which
requires
us
to
reverence
the
obscurities
difference
between
jesus
christ
and
mahomet
was
not
foretold
jesus
christ
was
foretold
mahomet
slew
jesus
christ
caused
his
own
to
be
slain
mahomet
forbade
reading
the
apostles
ordered
reading
in
fact
the
two
are
so
opposed
that
if
mahomet
took
the
way
to
succeed
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
jesus
christ
from
the
same
point
of
view
took
the
way
to
perish
and
instead
of
concluding
that
since
mahomet
succeeded
jesus
christ
might
well
have
succeeded
we
ought
to
say
that
since
mahomet
succeeded
jesus
christ
should
have
failed
any
man
can
do
what
mahomet
has
done
for
he
performed
no
miracles
he
was
not
foretold
no
man
can
do
what
christ
has
done
the
heathen
religion
has
no
foundation
at
the
present
day
it
is
said
once
to
have
had
a
foundation
by
the
oracles
which
spoke
but
what
are
the
books
which
assure
us
of
this
are
they
so
worthy
of
belief
on
account
of
the
virtue
of
their
authors
have
they
been
preserved
with
such
care
that
we
can
be
sure
that
they
have
not
been
meddled
with
the
mahometan
religion
has
for
a
foundation
the
koran
and
mahomet
but
has
this
prophet
who
was
to
be
the
last
hope
of
the
world
been
foretold
what
sign
has
he
that
every
other
man
has
not
who
chooses
to
call
himself
a
prophet
what
miracles
does
he
himself
say
that
he
has
done
what
mysteries
has
he
taught
even
according
to
his
own
tradition
what
was
the
morality
what
the
happiness
held
out
by
him
the
jewish
religion
must
be
differently
regarded
in
the
tradition
of
the
holy
bible
and
in
the
tradition
of
the
people
its
morality
and
happiness
are
absurd
in
the
tradition
of
the
people
but
are
admirable
in
that
of
the
holy
bible
and
all
religion
is
the
same
for
the
christian
religion
is
very
different
in
the
holy
bible
and
in
the
casuists
the
foundation
is
admirable
it
is
the
most
ancient
book
in
the
world
and
the
most
authentic
and
whereas
mahomet
in
order
to
make
his
own
book
continue
in
existence
forbade
men
to
read
it
moses
for
the
same
reason
ordered
every
one
to
read
his
our
religion
is
so
divine
that
another
divine
religion
has
only
been
the
foundation
of
it
to
see
what
is
clear
and
indisputable
in
the
whole
state
of
the
jews
the
jewish
religion
is
wholly
divine
in
its
authority
its
duration
its
perpetuity
its
morality
its
doctrine
and
its
effects
the
only
science
contrary
to
common
sense
and
human
nature
is
that
alone
which
has
always
existed
among
men
the
only
religion
contrary
to
nature
to
common
sense
and
to
our
pleasure
is
that
alone
which
has
always
existed
no
religion
but
our
own
has
taught
that
man
is
born
in
sin
no
sect
of
philosophers
has
said
this
therefore
none
have
declared
the
truth
no
sect
or
religion
has
always
existed
on
earth
but
the
christian
religion
whoever
judges
of
the
jewish
religion
by
its
coarser
forms
will
misunderstand
it
it
is
to
be
seen
in
the
holy
bible
and
in
the
tradition
of
the
prophets
who
have
made
it
plain
enough
that
they
did
not
interpret
the
law
according
to
the
letter
so
our
religion
is
divine
in
the
gospel
in
the
apostles
and
in
tradition
but
it
is
absurd
in
those
who
tamper
with
it
the
messiah
according
to
the
carnal
jews
was
to
be
a
great
temporal
prince
jesus
christ
according
to
carnal
christians
has
come
to
dispense
us
from
the
love
of
god
and
to
give
us
sacraments
which
shall
do
everything
without
our
help
such
is
not
the
christian
religion
nor
the
jewish
true
jews
and
true
christians
have
always
expected
a
messiah
who
should
make
them
love
god
and
by
that
love
triumph
over
their
enemies
the
carnal
jews
hold
a
midway
place
between
christians
and
heathens
the
heathens
know
not
god
and
love
the
world
only
the
jews
know
the
true
god
and
love
the
world
only
the
christians
know
the
true
god
and
love
not
the
world
jews
and
heathens
love
the
same
good
jews
and
christians
know
the
same
god
the
jews
were
of
two
kinds
the
first
had
only
heathen
affections
the
other
had
christian
affections
there
are
two
kinds
of
men
in
each
religion
among
the
heathen
worshippers
of
beasts
and
the
worshippers
of
the
one
only
god
of
natural
religion
among
the
jews
the
carnal
and
the
spiritual
who
were
the
christians
of
the
old
law
among
christians
the
who
are
the
jews
of
the
new
law
the
carnal
jews
looked
for
a
carnal
messiah
the
coarser
christians
believe
that
the
messiah
has
dispensed
them
from
the
love
of
god
true
jews
and
true
christians
worship
a
messiah
who
makes
them
love
god
show
that
the
true
jews
and
the
true
christians
have
but
the
same
the
religion
of
the
jews
seemed
to
consist
essentially
in
the
fatherhood
of
abraham
in
circumcision
in
sacrifices
in
ceremonies
in
the
ark
in
the
temple
in
jerusalem
and
finally
in
the
law
and
in
the
covenant
with
moses
i
say
that
it
consisted
in
none
of
those
things
but
only
in
the
love
of
god
and
that
god
disregarded
all
the
other
things
that
god
did
not
accept
the
posterity
of
abraham
that
the
jews
were
to
be
punished
like
strangers
if
they
transgressed
viii
if
thou
do
at
all

the

thy
god

testify
against
you

ye
shall
surely
perish

the
nations
which
the

if
they
loved

were
to
be

the

considered
their
merit
to
be
from
god
only

not
from
abraham

was

thence
it
came
to

being
in

were
not
circumcised

they
could
not

confounded

after

been
carried

into
every
kind
of
debauchery

there
were
saints
as
enoch
lamech
and
others
who
waited
patiently
for
the
christ
promised
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
noah
saw
the
wickedness
of
men
at
its
height
and
he
was
held
worthy
to
save
the
world
in
his
person
by
the
hope
of
the
messiah
of
whom
he
was
the
type
abraham
was
surrounded
by
idolaters

god
made
known
to
him
the
mystery
of
the
messiah
whom
he
welcomed
from
afar
in
the
time
of

was

lived

the
egyptians
were
infected
both
with
idolatry
and
magic
the
very
people
of
god
were
led
astray
by
their
example
yet
moses
and
others
believed
him
whom
they
saw
not
and
worshipped
him
looking
to
the
eternal
gifts
which
he
was
preparing
for
them
the
greeks
and
latins
then
set
up
false
deities
the
poets
made
a
hundred
different
theologies
while
the
philosophers
separated
into
a
thousand
different
sects
and
yet
in
the
heart
of
judæa
there
were
always
chosen
men
who
foretold
the
coming
of
this
messiah
which
was
known
to
them
alone
he
came
at
length
in
the
fullness
of
time
and
time
has
since
witnessed
the
birth
of
so
many
schisms
and
heresies
so
many
political
revolutions
so
many
changes
in
all
things
yet
this
church
which
worships
him
who
has
always
been
worshipped
has
endured
uninterruptedly
it
is
a
wonderful
incomparable
and
altogether
divine
fact
that
this
religion
which
has
always
endured
has
always
been
attacked
it
has
been
a
thousand
times
on
the
eve
of
universal
destruction
and
every
time
it
has
been
in
that
state
god
has
restored
it
by
extraordinary
acts
of
his
power
this
is
astonishing
as
also
that
it
has
preserved
itself
without
yielding
to
the
will
of
tyrants
for
it
is
not
strange
that
a
state
endures
when
its
laws
are
sometimes
made
to
give
way
to
necessity
but
that
see
the
passage
indicated
in
montaigne
states
would
perish
if
they
did
not
often
make
their
laws
give
way
to
necessity
but
religion
has
never
suffered
this
or
practised
it
indeed
there
must
be
these
compromises
or
miracles
it
is
not
strange
to
be
saved
by
yieldings
and
this
is
not
strictly
besides
in
the
end
they
perish
entirely
none
has
endured
a
thousand
years
but
the
fact
that
this
religion
has
always
maintained
itself
inflexible
as
it
is
proves
its
divinity
whatever
may
be
said
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
christian
religion
has
something
astonishing
in
it
some
will
say
this
is
because
you
were
born
in
it
far
from
it
i
stiffen
myself
against
it
for
this
very
reason
for
fear
this
prejudice
bias
me
but
although
i
am
born
in
it
i
can
not
help
finding
it
so
the
messiah
has
always
been
believed
in
the
tradition
from
adam
was
fresh
in
noah
and
in
moses
since
then
the
prophets
have
foretold
him
while
at
the
same
time
foretelling
other
things
which
being
from
time
to
time
fulfilled
in
the
sight
of
men
showed
the
truth
of
their
mission
and
consequently
that
of
their
promises
touching
the
messiah
jesus
christ
performed
miracles
and
the
apostles
also
who
converted
all
the
heathen
and
all
the
prophecies
being
thereby
fulfilled
the
messiah
is
for
ever
proved
let
us
consider
that
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
the
expectation
of
worship
of
the
messiah
has
existed
uninterruptedly
that
there
have
been
found
men
who
said
that
god
had
revealed
to
them
that
a
redeemer
was
to
be
born
who
should
save
his
people
that
abraham
came
afterwards
saying
that
he
had
had
a
revelation
that
the
messiah
was
to
spring
from
him
by
a
son
whom
he
should
have
that
jacob
declared
that
of
his
twelve
sons
the
messiah
would
spring
from
judah
that
moses
and
the
prophets
then
came
to
declare
the
time
and
the
manner
of
his
coming
that
they
said
their
law
was
only
temporary
till
that
of
the
messiah
that
it
should
endure
till
then
but
that
the
other
should
last
for
ever
that
thus
either
their
law
or
that
of
the
messiah
of
which
it
was
the
promise
would
be
always
upon
the
earth
that
in
fact
it
has
always
endured
that
at
last
jesus
christ
came
with
all
the
circumstances
foretold
this
is
wonderful
this
is
positive
fact
while
all
philosophers
separate
into
different
sects
there
is
found
in
one
corner
of
the
world
the
most
ancient
people
in
it
declaring
that
all
the
world
is
in
error
that
god
has
revealed
to
them
the
truth
that
they
will
always
exist
on
the
earth
in
fact
all
other
sects
come
to
an
end
this
one
still
endures
and
has
done
so
for
four
thousand
years
they
declare
that
they
hold
from
their
ancestors
that
man
has
fallen
from
communion
with
god
and
is
entirely
estranged
from
god
but
that
he
has
promised
to
redeem
them
that
this
doctrine
shall
always
exist
on
the
earth
that
their
law
has
a
double
signification
that
during
sixteen
hundred
years
they
have
had
people
whom
they
believed
prophets
foretelling
both
the
time
and
the
manner
that
four
hundred
years
after
they
were
scattered
everywhere
because
jesus
christ
was
to
be
everywhere
announced
that
jesus
christ
came
in
the
manner
and
at
the
time
foretold
that
the
jews
have
since
been
scattered
abroad
under
a
curse
and
nevertheless
still
exist
i
see
the
christian
religion
founded
upon
a
preceding
religion
and
this
is
what
i
find
as
a
fact
i
do
not
here
speak
of
the
miracles
of
moses
of
jesus
christ
and
of
the
apostles
because
they
do
not
at
first
seem
convincing
and
because
i
only
wish
here
to
put
in
evidence
all
those
foundations
of
the
christian
religion
which
are
beyond
doubt
and
which
can
not
be
called
in
question
by
any
person
whatsoever
it
is
certain
that
we
see
in
many
places
of
the
world
a
peculiar
people
separated
from
all
other
peoples
of
the
world
and
called
the
jewish
people
i
see
then
a
crowd
of
religions
in
many
parts
of
the
world
and
in
all
times
but
their
morality
can
not
please
me
nor
can
their
proofs
convince
me
thus
i
should
equally
have
rejected
the
religion
of
mahomet
and
of
china
of
the
ancient
romans
and
of
the
egyptians
for
the
sole
reason
that
none
having
more
marks
of
truth
than
another
nor
anything
which
should
necessarily
persuade
me
reason
can
not
incline
to
one
rather
than
the
other
but
in
thus
considering
this
changeable
and
singular
variety
of
morals
and
beliefs
at
different
times
i
find
in
one
corner
of
the
world
a
peculiar
people
separated
from
all
other
peoples
on
earth
the
most
ancient
of
all
and
whose
histories
are
earlier
by
many
generations
than
the
most
ancient
which
we
possess
i
find
then
this
great
and
numerous
people
sprung
from
a
single
man
who
worship
one
god
and
guide
themselves
by
a
law
which
they
say
that
they
obtained
from
his
own
hand
they
maintain
that
they
are
the
only
people
in
the
world
to
whom
god
has
revealed
his
mysteries
that
all
men
are
corrupt
and
in
disgrace
with
god
that
they
are
all
abandoned
to
their
senses
and
their
own
imagination
whence
come
the
strange
errors
and
continual
changes
which
happen
among
them
both
of
religions
and
of
morals
whereas
they
themselves
remain
firm
in
their
conduct
but
that
god
will
not
leave
other
nations
in
this
darkness
for
ever
that
there
will
come
a
saviour
for
all
that
they
are
in
the
world
to
announce
him
to
men
that
they
are
expressly
formed
to
be
forerunners
and
heralds
of
this
great
event
and
to
summon
all
nations
to
join
with
them
in
the
expectation
of
this
saviour
to
meet
with
this
people
is
astonishing
to
me
and
seems
to
me
worthy
of
attention
i
look
at
the
law
which
they
boast
of
having
obtained
from
god
and
i
find
it
admirable
it
is
the
first
law
of
all
and
is
of
such
a
kind
that
even
before
the
term
was
in
currency
among
the
greeks
it
had
for
nearly
a
thousand
years
earlier
been
uninterruptedly
accepted
and
observed
by
the
jews
i
likewise
think
it
strange
that
the
first
law
of
the
world
happens
to
be
the
most
perfect
so
that
the
greatest
legislators
have
borrowed
their
laws
from
it
as
is
apparent
from
the
law
of
the
twelve
tables
at
athens
afterwards
taken
by
the
romans
and
as
it
would
be
easy
to
prove
if
josephus
and
others
had
not
sufficiently
dealt
with
this
subject
of
the
jewish
in
this
search
the
jewish
people
at
once
attracts
my
attention
by
the
number
of
wonderful
and
singular
facts
which
appear
about
them
i
first
see
that
they
are
a
people
wholly
composed
of
brethren
and
whereas
all
others
are
formed
by
the
assemblage
of
an
infinity
of
families
this
though
so
wonderfully
fruitful
has
all
sprung
from
one
man
alone
and
being
thus
all
one
flesh
and
members
one
of
another
they
constitute
a
powerful
state
of
one
family
this
is
unique
this
family
or
people
is
the
most
ancient
within
human
knowledge
a
fact
which
seems
to
me
to
inspire
a
peculiar
veneration
for
it
especially
in
view
of
our
present
inquiry
since
if
god
had
from
all
time
revealed
himself
to
men
it
is
to
these
we
must
turn
for
knowledge
of
the
tradition
this
people
is
not
eminent
solely
by
their
antiquity
but
is
also
singular
by
their
duration
which
has
always
continued
from
their
origin
till
now
for
whereas
the
nations
of
greece
and
of
italy
of
lacedæmon
of
athens
and
of
rome
and
others
who
came
long
after
have
long
since
perished
these
ever
remain
and
in
spite
of
the
endeavours
of
many
powerful
kings
who
have
a
hundred
times
tried
to
destroy
them
as
their
historians
testify
and
as
it
is
easy
to
conjecture
from
the
natural
order
of
things
during
so
long
a
space
of
years
they
have
nevertheless
been
preserved
and
this
preservation
has
been
foretold
and
extending
from
the
earliest
times
to
the
latest
their
history
comprehends
in
its
duration
all
our
histories
which
it
preceded
by
a
long
time
the
law
by
which
this
people
is
governed
is
at
once
the
most
ancient
law
in
the
world
the
most
perfect
and
the
only
one
which
has
been
always
observed
without
a
break
in
a
state
this
is
what
josephus
admirably
proves
and
also
philo
the
jew
in
different
places
where
they
point
out
that
it
is
so
ancient
that
the
very
name
of
was
only
known
by
the
oldest
nation
more
than
a
thousand
years
afterwards
so
that
homer
who
has
written
the
history
of
so
many
states
has
never
used
the
term
and
it
is
easy
to
judge
of
its
perfection
by
simply
reading
it
for
we
see
that
it
has
provided
for
all
things
with
so
great
wisdom
equity
and
judgment
that
the
most
ancient
legislators
greek
and
roman
having
had
some
knowledge
of
it
have
borrowed
from
it
their
principal
laws
this
is
evident
from
what
are
called
the
twelve
tables
and
from
the
other
proofs
which
josephus
gives
but
this
law
is
at
the
same
time
the
severest
and
strictest
of
all
in
respect
to
their
religious
worship
imposing
on
this
people
in
order
to
keep
them
to
their
duty
a
thousand
peculiar
and
painful
observances
on
pain
of
death
whence
it
is
very
astonishing
that
it
has
been
constantly
preserved
during
many
centuries
by
a
people
rebellious
and
impatient
as
this
one
was
while
all
other
states
have
changed
their
laws
from
time
to
time
although
these
were
far
more
lenient
the
book
which
contains
this
law
the
first
of
all
is
itself
the
most
ancient
book
in
the
world
those
of
homer
hesiod
and
others
being
six
or
seven
hundred
years
later
the
creation
and
the
deluge
being
past
and
god
no
longer
requiring
to
destroy
the
world
nor
to
create
it
anew
nor
to
give
such
great
signs
of
himself
he
began
to
establish
a
people
on
the
earth
purposely
formed
who
were
to
last
until
the
coming
of
the
people
whom
the
messiah
should
fashion
by
his
spirit
the
creation
of
the
world
beginning
to
be
distant
god
provided
a
single
contemporary
historian
and
appointed
a
whole
people
as
guardians
of
this
book
in
order
that
this
history
might
be
the
most
authentic
in
the
world
and
that
all
men
might
thereby
learn
a
fact
so
necessary
to
know
and
which
could
only
be
known
through
that
means
japhet
begins
the
genealogy
joseph
folds
his
arms
and
prefers
the
younger
why
should
moses
make
the
lives
of
men
so
long
and
their
generations
so
few
because
it
is
not
the
length
of
years
but
the
multitude
of
generations
which
renders
things
obscure
for
truth
is
perverted
only
by
the
change
of
men
and
yet
he
puts
two
things
the
most
memorable
that
were
ever
imagined
namely
the
creation
and
the
deluge
so
near
that
we
reach
from
one
to
the
other
shem
who
saw
lamech
who
saw
adam
saw
also
jacob
who
saw
those
who
saw
moses
therefore
the
deluge
and
the
creation
are
true
this
is
conclusive
among
certain
people
who
understand
it
rightly
the
longevity
of
the
patriarchs
instead
of
causing
the
loss
of
past
history
conduced
on
the
contrary
to
its
preservation
for
the
reason
why
we
are
sometimes
insufficiently
instructed
in
the
history
of
our
ancestors
is
that
we
have
never
lived
long
with
them
and
that
they
are
often
dead
before
we
have
attained
the
age
of
reason
now
when
men
lived
so
long
children
lived
long
with
their
parents
they
conversed
long
with
them
but
what
else
could
be
the
subject
of
their
talk
save
the
history
of
their
ancestors
since
to
that
all
history
was
reduced
and
men
did
not
study
science
or
art
which
now
form
a
large
part
of
daily
conversation
we
see
also
that
in
these
days
tribes
took
particular
care
to
preserve
their
genealogies
i
believe
that
joshua
was
the
first
of
god
people
to
have
this
name
as
jesus
christ
was
the
last
of
god
people
of
the
what
a
difference
there
is
between
one
book
and
another
i
am
not
astonished
that
the
greeks
made
the
iliad
nor
the
egyptians
and
the
chinese
their
histories
we
have
only
to
see
how
this
originates
these
fabulous
historians
are
not
contemporaneous
with
the
facts
about
which
they
write
homer
composes
a
romance
which
he
gives
out
as
such
and
which
is
received
as
such
for
nobody
doubted
that
troy
and
agamemnon
no
more
existed
than
did
the
golden
apple
accordingly
he
did
not
think
of
making
a
history
but
solely
a
book
to
amuse
he
is
the
only
writer
of
his
time
the
beauty
of
the
work
has
made
it
last
every
one
learns
it
and
talks
of
it
it
is
necessary
to
know
it
and
each
one
knows
it
by
heart
four
hundred
years
afterwards
the
witnesses
of
these
facts
are
no
longer
alive
no
one
knows
of
his
own
knowledge
if
it
be
a
fable
or
a
history
one
has
only
learnt
it
from
his
ancestors
and
this
can
pass
for
truth
every
history
which
is
not
contemporaneous
as
the
books
of
the
sibyls
and
trismegistus
and
so
many
others
which
have
been
believed
by
the
world
are
false
and
found
to
be
false
in
the
course
of
time
it
is
not
so
with
contemporaneous
writers
there
is
a
great
difference
between
a
book
which
an
individual
writes
and
publishes
to
a
nation
and
a
book
which
itself
creates
a
nation
we
can
not
doubt
that
the
book
is
as
old
as
the
people
josephus
hides
the
shame
of
his
nation
moses
does
not
hide
his
own
shame
mihi
det
ut
omnes
prophetent
he
was
weary
of
the
multitude
sincerity
of
the
maccabees
after
they
had
no
more
prophets
the
masorah
since
jesus
christ
this
book
will
be
a
testimony
for
you
defective
and
final
letters
sincere
against
their
honour
and
dying
for
it
this
has
no
example
in
the
world
and
no
root
in
nature
of
the
they
preserve
lovingly
and
carefully
the
book
in
which
moses
declares
that
they
have
been
all
their
life
ungrateful
to
god
and
that
he
knows
they
will
be
still
more
so
after
his
death
but
that
he
calls
heaven
and
earth
to
witness
against
them
and
that
he
has
them
enough
he
declares
that
god
being
angry
with
them
shall
at
last
scatter
them
among
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
that
as
they
have
offended
him
by
worshipping
gods
who
were
not
their
god
so
he
will
provoke
them
by
calling
a
people
who
are
not
his
people
that
he
desires
that
all
his
words
be
preserved
for
ever
and
that
his
book
be
placed
in
the
ark
of
the
covenant
to
serve
for
ever
as
a
witness
against
them
isaiah
says
the
same
thing
xxx
the
story
that
the
books
were
burnt
with
the

proved
false
by

jeremiah

says
that
the
law
was
in
hebrew
when
it
was
translated
by
the
seventy
under
antiochus
and
vespasian
when
they
wanted
to
abolish
the
books
and
when
there
was
no
prophet
they
could
not
do
so
and
under
the
babylonians
when
no
persecution
had
been
made
and
when
there
were
so
many
prophets
would
they
have
let
them
be
burnt

says
that

easily
have

the

of

destroyed

as

alleges
this
to
prove
that
it
is
not
incredible
that
the
seventy
may
have
explained
the
holy
scriptures
with
that
uniformity
which
we
admire
in
them
and
he
took
that
from

saint

in
his
preface
to

that
esdras
arranged

psalms

the
origin
of

tradition
comes
from
the
chapter
of
the

of

from
the

to

the

under

in

hence
they
could
well
have
the

josephus
in
the
whole
history
of
esdras
does
not
say
one
word
about
this
kings
xvii
if
the
story
in
esdras
is
credible
then
it
must
be
believed
that
the
scripture
is
holy
scripture
for
this
story
is
based
only
on
the
authority
of
those
who
assert
that
of
the
seventy
which
shows
that
the
scripture
is
holy
therefore
if
this
account
be
true
we
have
what
we
want
therein
if
not
we
have
it
elsewhere
and
thus
those
who
would
ruin
the
truth
of
our
religion
founded
on
moses
establish
it
by
the
same
authority
by
which
they
attack
it

by

with
the
assurance
of
deliverance
within
seventy
years
was
not
real
captivity
but
now
they
are
captives
without
any
hope
god
has
promised
them
that
even
though
he
should
scatter
them
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
nevertheless
if
they
were
faithful
to
his
law
he
would
assemble
them
together
again
they
are
very
faithful
to
it
and
remain
oppressed
when
nebuchadnezzar
carried
away
the
people
for
fear
they
should
believe
that
the
sceptre
had
departed
from
judah
they
were
told
beforehand
that
they
would
be
there
for
a
short
time
and
that
they
would
be
restored
they
were
always
consoled
by
the
prophets
and
their
kings
continued
but
the
second
destruction
is
without
promise
of
restoration
without
prophets
without
kings
without
consolation
without
hope
because
the
sceptre
is
taken
away
for
ever
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
and
worthy
of
particular
attention
to
see
this
jewish
people
existing
so
many
years
in
perpetual
misery
it
being
necessary
as
a
proof
of
jesus
christ
both
that
they
should
exist
to
prove
him
and
that
they
should
be
miserable
because
they
crucified
him
and
though
to
be
miserable
and
to
exist
are
contradictory
they
nevertheless
still
exist
in
spite
of
their
misery
they
are
visibly
a
people
expressly
created
to
serve
as
a
witness
to
the
messiah
isaiah
xliii
xliv
they
keep
the
books
and
love
them
and
do
not
understand
them
and
all
this
was
foretold
that
judgments
are
entrusted
to
them
but
as
a
sealed
book
section
x
typology
of
the
two
testaments
at
to
prove
the
two
at
one
stroke
we
need
only
see
if
the
prophecies
in
one
are
fulfilled
in
the
other
to
examine
the
prophecies
we
must
understand
them
for
if
we
believe
they
have
only
one
meaning
it
is
certain
that
the
messiah
has
not
come
but
if
they
have
two
meanings
it
is
certain
that
he
has
come
in
jesus
christ
the
whole
problem
then
is
to
know
if
they
have
two
meanings
that
the
scripture
has
two
meanings
which
jesus
christ
and
the
apostles
have
given
is
shown
by
the
following
proofs
proof
by
scripture
itself
proof
by
the
rabbis
moses
maimonides
says
that
it
has
two
aspects
and
that

have
prophesied
jesus
christ
only
proof
by
the
kabbala
proof
by
the
mystical
interpretation
which
the
rabbis
themselves
give
to
scripture
proof
by
the
principles
of
the
rabbis
that
there
are
two
meanings
that
there
are
two
advents
of
the
messiah
a
glorious
and
an
humiliating
one
according
to
their
desert
that
the
prophets
have
prophesied
of
the
messiah
only
the
law
is
not
eternal
but
must
change
at
the
coming
of
the
messiah
that
then
they
shall
no
more
remember
the
red
sea
that
the
jews
and
the
gentiles
shall
be
mingled

by
the
key
which
jesus

and
the
apostles
give
us

done
in
the

what
he

do
in
those
of

in

that
we
might
judge
that
he
could
make
the
invisible

he
made
the
visible

therefore
he
saved
this
people
from
the

he
has
raised
them
up
from

redeemed
them
from
their
enemies
and
set
them
at

the
object
of
god
was
not
to
save
them
from
the
deluge
and
raise
up
a
whole
people
from
abraham
only
in
order
to
bring
them
into
a
rich

even
grace
is
only
the
type
of
glory
for
it
is
not
the
ultimate
end
it
has
been
symbolised
by
the
law
and
itself
symbolises
but
it
is
the
type
of
it
and
the
origin
or
cause
the
ordinary
life
of
men
is
like
that
of
the
saints
they
all
seek
their
satisfaction
and
differ
only
in
the
object
in
which
they
place
it
they
call
those
their
enemies
who
hinder
them
etc
god
has
then
shown
the
power
which
he
has
of
giving
invisible
blessings
by
that
which
he
has
shown
himself
to
have
over
things
visible
god
wishing
to
form
for
himself
an
holy
people
whom
he
should
separate
from
all
other
nations
whom
he
should
deliver
from
their
enemies
and
should
put
into
a
place
of
rest
has
promised
to
do
so
and
has
foretold
by
his
prophets
the
time
and
the
manner
of
his
coming
and
yet
to
confirm
the
hope
of
his
elect
he
has
made
them
see
in
it
an
image
through
all
time
without
leaving
them
devoid
of
assurances
of
his
power
and
of
his
will
to
save
them
for
at
the
creation
of
man
adam
was
the
witness
and
guardian
of
the
promise
of
a
saviour
who
should
be
born
of
woman
when
men
were
still
so
near
the
creation
that
they
could
not
have
forgotten
their
creation
and
their
fall
when
those
who
had
seen
adam
were
no
longer
in
the
world
god
sent
noah
whom
he
saved
and
drowned
the
whole
earth
by
a
miracle
which
sufficiently
indicated
the
power
which
he
had
to
save
the
world
and
the
will
which
he
had
to
do
so
and
to
raise
up
from
the
seed
of
woman
him
whom
he
had
promised
this
miracle
was
enough
to
confirm
the
hope
of
men
the
memory
of
the
deluge
being
so
fresh
among
men
while
noah
was
still
alive
god
made
promises
to
abraham
and
while
shem
was
still
living
sent
moses
etc
god
willing
to
deprive
his
own
of
perishable
blessings
created
the
jewish
people
in
order
to
show
that
this
was
not
owing
to
lack
of
power
the
synagogue
did
not
perish
because
it
was
a
type
but
because
it
was
only
a
type
it
fell
into
servitude
the
type
existed
till
the
truth
came
in
order
that
the
church
should
be
always
visible
either
in
the
sign
which
promised
it
or
in
substance
that
the
law
was
figurative
two
errors
to
take
everything
literally
to
take
everything
spiritually
to
speak
against
too
greatly
figurative
language
there
are
some
types
clear
and
demonstrative
but
others
which
seem
somewhat
and
which
convince
only
those
who
are
already
persuaded
these
are
like
the
apocalyptics
but
the
difference
is
that
they
have
none
which
are
certain
so
that
nothing
is
so
unjust
as
to
claim
that
theirs
are
as
well
founded
as
some
of
ours
for
they
have
none
so
demonstrative
as
some
of
ours
the
comparison
is
unfair
we
must
not
put
on
the
same
level
and
confound
things
because
they
seem
to
agree
in
one
point
while
they
are
so
different
in
another
the
clearness
in
divine
things
requires
us
to
revere
the
obscurities
in
them
it
is
like
men
who
employ
a
certain
obscure
language
among
themselves
those
who
should
not
understand
it
would
understand
only
a
foolish
meaning
of
the
apocalyptics
preadamites
millenarians
he
who
would
base
extravagant
opinions
on
scripture
will
for
example
base
them
on
this

is
said
that
this
generation
shall
not
pass
till
all
these
things
be
fulfilled

that
after

generation
will
come

so

in
succession
solomon

are

the

if
adam
had
not
sinned
and
jesus

had
not
come
there
had
been
only
one
covenant
only
one
age
of
men
and
the
creation
would
have
been
represented
as
accomplished
at
one
single
time
the
jewish
and
egyptian
peoples
were
plainly
foretold
by
the
two
individuals
whom
moses
met
the
egyptian
beating
the
jew
moses
avenging
him
and
killing
the
egyptian
and
the
jew
being
ungrateful
the
symbols
of
the
gospel
for
the
state
of
the
sick
soul
are
sick
bodies
but
because
one
body
can
not
be
sick
enough
to
express
it
well
several
have
been
needed
thus
there
are
the
deaf
the
dumb
the
blind
the
paralytic
the
dead
lazarus
the
possessed
all
this
crowd
is
in
the
sick
soul
to
show
that
the
old
testament
is
only
figurative
and
that
the
prophets
understood
by
temporal
blessings
other
blessings
this
is
the
proof
first
that
this
would
be
unworthy
of
god
secondly
that
their
discourses
express
very
clearly
the
promise
of
temporal
blessings
and
that
they
say
nevertheless
that
their
discourses
are
obscure
and
that
their
meaning
will
not
be
understood
whence
it
appears
that
this
secret
meaning
was
not
that
which
they
openly
expressed
and
that
consequently
they
meant
to
speak
of
other
sacrifices
of
another
deliverer
etc
they
say
that
they
will
be
understood
only
in
the
fullness
of
time
jer
xxx
the
third
proof
is
that
their
discourses
are
contradictory
and
neutralise
each
other
so
that
if
we
think
that
they
did
not
mean
by
the
words
law
and
sacrifice
anything
else
than
that
of
moses
there
is
a
plain
and
gross
contradiction
therefore
they
meant
something
else
sometimes
contradicting
themselves
in
the
same
chapter
now
to
understand
the
meaning
of
an
author
lust
has
become
natural
to
us
and
has
made
our
second
nature
thus
there
are
two
natures
in
us
the
one
good
the
other
bad
where
is
god
where
you
are
not
and
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
you
the
rabbis
penitence
alone
of
all
these
mysteries
has
been
manifestly
declared
to
the
jews
and
by
saint
john
the
forerunner
and
then
the
other
mysteries
to
indicate
that
in
each
man
as
in
the
entire
world
this
order
must
be
observed
the
carnal
jews
understood
neither
the
greatness
nor
the
humiliation
of
the
messiah
foretold
in
their
prophecies
they
misunderstood
him
in
his
foretold
greatness
as
when
he
said
that
the
messiah
should
be
lord
of
david
though
his
son
and
that
he
was
before
abraham
who
had
seen
him
they
did
not
believe
him
so
great
as
to
be
eternal
and
they
likewise
misunderstood
him
in
his
humiliation
and
in
his
death
the
messiah
said
they
abideth
for
ever
and
this
man
says
that
he
shall
die
therefore
they
believed
him
neither
mortal
nor
eternal
they
only
sought
in
him
for
a
carnal
greatness
nothing
is
so
like
charity
as
covetousness
and
nothing
is
so
opposed
to
it
thus
the
jews
full
of
possessions
which
flattered
their
covetousness
were
very
like
christians
and
very
contrary
and
by
this
means
they
had
the
two
qualities
which
it
was
necessary
they
should
have
to
be
very
like
the
messiah
to
typify
him
and
very
contrary
not
to
be
suspected
witnesses
god
made
use
of
the
lust
of
the
jews
to
make
them
minister
to
jesus
christ
who
brought
the
remedy
for
their
lust
charity
is
not
a
figurative
precept
it
is
dreadful
to
say
that
jesus
christ
who
came
to
take
away
types
in
order
to
establish
the
truth
came
only
to
establish
the
type
of
charity
in
order
to
take
away
the
existing
reality
which
was
there
before
if
the
light
be
darkness
how

the
expressions

we
are
estranged
only
by
departing
from
charity
our
prayers
and
our
virtues
are
abominable
before
god
if
they
are
not
the
prayers
and
the
virtues
of
jesus
christ
and
our
sins
will
never
be
the
object
of
but
of
the
justice
of
god
if
they
are
not
jesus
christ
he
has
adopted
our
sins
and
has
us
into
union
for
virtues
are
own
sins
are
foreign
to
him
while
virtues
are
foreign
to
us
and
our
sins
are
our
own
let
us
change
the
rule
which
we
have
hitherto
chosen
for
judging
what
is
good
we
had
our
own
will
as
our
rule
let
us
now
take
the
will
of
all
that
he
wills
is
good
and
right
to
us
all
that
he
does
not
will
is
all
that
god
does
not
permit
is
forbidden
sins
are
forbidden
by
the
general
declaration
that
god
has
made
that
he
did
not
allow
them
other
things
which
he
has
left
without
general
prohibition
and
which
for
that
reason
are
said
to
be
permitted
are
nevertheless
not
always
permitted
for
when
god
removed
some
one
of
them
from
us
and
when
by
the
event
which
is
a
manifestation
of
the
will
of
god
it
appears
that
god
does
not
will
that
we
should
have
a
thing
that
is
then
forbidden
to
us
as
sin
since
the
will
of
god
is
that
we
should
not
have
one
more
than
another
there
is
this
sole
difference
between
these
two
things
that
it
is
certain
that
god
will
never
allow
sin
while
it
is
not
certain
that
he
will
never
allow
the
other
but
so
long
as
god
does
not
permit
it
we
ought
to
regard
it
as
sin
so
long
as
the
absence
of
god
will
which
alone
is
all
goodness
and
all
justice
renders
it
unjust
and
wrong
to
change
the
type
because
of
our
weakness
the
jews
had
grown
old
in
these
earthly
thoughts
that
god
loved
their
father
abraham
his
flesh
and
what
sprung
from
it
that
on
account
of
this
he
had
multiplied
them
and
distinguished
them
from
all
other
nations
without
allowing
them
to
intermingle
that
when
they
were
languishing
in
egypt
he
brought
them
out
with
all
these
great
signs
in
their
favour
that
he
fed
them
with
manna
in
the
desert
and
led
them
into
a
very
rich
land
that
he
gave
them
kings
and
a
temple
in
order
to
offer
up
beasts
before
him
by
the
shedding
of
whose
blood
they
should
be
purified
and
that
at
last
he
was
to
send
them
the
messiah
to
make
them
masters
of
all
the
world
and
foretold
the
time
of
his
coming
the
world
having
grown
old
in
these
carnal
errors
jesus
christ
came
at
the
time
foretold
but
not
with
the
expected
glory
and
thus
men
did
not
think
it
was
he
after
his
death
saint
paul
came
to
teach
men
that
all
these
things
had
happened
in
allegory
that
the
kingdom
of
god
did
not
consist
in
the
flesh
but
in
the
spirit
that
the
enemies
of
men
were
not
the
babylonians
but
the
passions
that
god
delighted
not
in
temples
made
with
hands
but
in
a
pure
and
contrite
heart
that
the
circumcision
of
the
body
was
unprofitable
but
that
of
the
heart
was
needed
that
moses
had
not
given
them
the
bread
from
heaven
etc
but
god
not
having
desired
to
reveal
these
things
to
this
people
who
were
unworthy
of
them
and
having
nevertheless
desired
to
foretell
them
in
order
that
they
might
be
believed
foretold
the
time
clearly
and
expressed
the
things
sometimes
clearly
but
very
often
in
figures
in
order
that
those
who
loved
symbols
might
consider
them
and
those
who
loved
what
was
symbolised
might
see
it
therein
all
that
tends
not
to
charity
is
figurative
the
sole
aim
of
the
scripture
is
charity
all
which
tends
not
to
the
sole
end
is
the
type
of
it
for
since
there
is
only
one
end
all
which
does
not
lead
to
it
in
express
terms
is
figurative
god
thus
varies
that
sole
precept
of
charity
to
satisfy
our
curiosity
which
seeks
for
variety
by
that
variety
which
still
leads
us
to
the
one
thing
needful
for
one
thing
alone
is
needful
and
we
love
variety
and
god
satisfies
both
by
these
varieties
which
lead
to
the
one
thing
needful
the
jews
have
so
much
loved
the
shadows
and
have
so
strictly
expected
them
that
they
have
misunderstood
the
reality
when
it
came
in
the
time
and
manner
foretold
the
rabbis
take
the
breasts
of
the
spouse
for
types
and
all
that
does
not
express
the
only
end
they
have
namely
temporal
good
and
christians
take
even
the
eucharist
as
a
type
of
the
glory
at
which
they
aim
the
jews
who
have
been
called
to
subdue
nations
and
kings
have
been
the
slaves
of
sin
and
the
christians
whose
calling
has
been
to
be
servants
and
subjects
are
free
children
formal
when
saint
peter
and
the
apostles
deliberated
about
abolishing
circumcision
where
it
was
a
question
of
acting
against
the
law
of
god
they
did
not
heed
the
prophets
but
simply
the
reception
of
the
holy
spirit
in
the
persons
uncircumcised
they
thought
it
more
certain
that
god
approved
of
those
whom
he
filled
with
his
spirit
than
it
was
that
the
law
must
be
obeyed
they
knew
that
the
end
of
the
law
was
only
the
holy
spirit
and
that
thus
as
men
certainly
had
this
without
circumcision
it
was
not
necessary
secundum

in
the
jewish
religion
then
has
been
formed
on
its
likeness
to
the
truth
of
the
messiah
and
the
truth
of
the
messiah
has
been
recognised
by
the
jewish
religion
which
was
the
type
of
it
among
the
jews
the
truth
was
only
typified
in
heaven
it
is
revealed
in
the
church
it
is
hidden
and
recognised

its

type

type

the
truth
and
the
truth
has
been

saint
paul
says
himself
that
people
will
forbid
to
marry
and
he
himself
speaks
of
it
to
the
corinthians
in
a
way
which
is
a
snare
for
if
a
prophet
had
said
the
one
and

paul
had
then
said
the
other
he
would
have

on

paul
says
that

jews
have
shadowed
forth
heavenly
things
and
yet
this
covenant
made
to
blind
some
and
enlighten
others
indicated
in
those
very
persons

it
blinded

the
visible
blessings

received
from
god
were
so
great
and
so
divine
that
he
indeed
appeared
able
to
give
them
those
that
are
invisible
and
a
messiah
for
nature
is
an
image
of
grace
and
visible
miracles
are
images
of
the
invisible
sciatis

isaiah
says
that
redemption
will
be
as
the
passage
of
the
red
sea
god
has
then
shown
by
the
deliverance
from
egypt
and
from
the
sea
by
the
defeat
of
kings
by
the
manna
by
the
whole
genealogy
of
abraham
that
he
was
able
to
save
to
send
down
bread
from
heaven
etc
so
that
the
people
hostile
to
him
are
the
type
and
the
representation
of
the
very
messiah
whom
they
know
not
etc
he
has
then
taught
us
at
last
that
all
these
things
were
only
types
and
what
is
true
freedom
a
true
israelite
true
circumcision
true
bread
from
heaven
etc
in
these
promises
each
one
finds
what
he
has
most
at
heart
temporal
benefits
or
spiritual
god
or
the
creatures
but
with
this
difference
that
those
who
therein
seek
the
creatures
find
them
but
with
many
contradictions
with
a
prohibition
against
loving
them
with
the
command
to
worship
god
only
and
to
love
him
only
which
is
the
same
thing
and
finally
that
the
messiah
came
not
for
them
whereas
those
who
therein
seek
god
find
him
without
any
contradiction
with
the
command
to
love
him
only
and
that
the
messiah
came
in
the
time
foretold
to
give
them
the
blessings
which
they
ask
thus
the
jews
had
miracles
and
prophecies
which
they
say
fulfilled
and
the
teaching
of
their
law
was
to
worship
and
love
god
only
it
was
also
perpetual
thus
it
had
all
the
marks
of
the
true
religion
and
so
it
was
but
the
jewish
teaching
must
be
distinguished
from
the
teaching
of
the
jewish
law
now
the
jewish
teaching
was
not
true
although
it
had
miracles
and
prophecy
and
perpetuity
because
it
had
not
this
other
point
of
worshipping
and
loving
god
only
the
veil
which
is
upon
these
books
for
the
jews
is
there
also
for
evil
christians
and
for
all
who
do
not
hate
themselves
but
how
well
disposed
men
are
to
understand
them
and
to
know
jesus
christ
when
they
truly
hate
themselves
a
type
conveys
absence
and
presence
pleasure
and
pain
a
cipher
has
a
double
meaning
one
clear
and
one
in
which
it
is
said
that
the
meaning
is
hidden
a
portrait
conveys
absence
and
presence
pleasure
and
pain
the
reality
excludes
absence
and
pain
to
know
if
the
law
and
the
sacrifices
are
a
reality
or
a
type
we
must
see
if
the
prophets
in
speaking
of
these
things
confined
their
view
and
their
thought
to
them
so
that
they
saw
only
the
old
covenant
or
if
they
saw
therein
something
else
of
which
they
were
the
representation
for
in
a
portrait
we
see
the
thing
figured
for
this
we
need
only
examine
what
they
say
of
them
when
they
say
that
it
will
be
eternal
do
they
mean
to
speak
of
that
covenant
which
they
say
will
be
changed
and
so
of
the
sacrifices
a
cipher
has
two
meanings
when
we
find
out
an
important
letter
in
which
we
discover
a
clear
meaning
and
in
which
it
is
nevertheless
said
that
the
meaning
is
veiled
and
obscure
that
it
is
hidden
so
that
we
might
read
the
letter
without
seeing
it
and
interpret
it
without
understanding
it
what
must
we
think
but
that
here
is
a
cipher
with
a
double
meaning
and
the
more
so
if
we
find
obvious
contradictions
in
the
literal
meaning
the
prophets
have
clearly
said
that
israel
would
be
always
loved
by
god
and
that
the
law
would
be
eternal
and
they
have
said
that
their
meaning
would
not
be
understood
and
that
it
was
veiled
how
greatly
then
ought
we
to
value
those
who
interpret
the
cipher
and
teach
us
to
understand
the
hidden
meaning
especially
if
the
principles
which
they
educe
are
perfectly
clear
and
natural
this
is
what
jesus
christ
did
and
the
apostles
they
broke
the
seal
he
rent
the
veil
and
revealed
the
spirit
they
have
taught
us
through
this
that
the
enemies
of
man
are
his
passions
that
the
redeemer
would
be
spiritual
and
his
reign
spiritual
that
there
would
be
two
advents
one
in
lowliness
to
humble
the
proud
the
other
in
glory
to
exalt
the
humble
that
jesus
christ
would
be
both
god
and
man
jesus
christ
opened
their
mind
to
understand
the
scriptures
two
great
revelations
are
these
all
things
happened
to
them
in
types
israëlitæ
vere
true
bread
from
heaven
a
god
humbled
to
the
cross
it
was
necessary
that
christ
should
suffer
in
order
to
enter
into
glory
that
he
should
destroy
death
through
death
two
advents
when
once
this
secret
is
disclosed
it
is
impossible
not
to
see
it
let
us
read
the
old
testament
in
this
light
and
let
us
see
if
the
sacrifices
were
real
if
the
fatherhood
of
abraham
was
the
true
cause
of
the
friendship
of
god
and
if
the
promised
land
was
the
true
place
of
rest
no
they
are
therefore
types
let
us
in
the
same
way
examine
all
those
ordained
ceremonies
all
those
commandments
which
are
not
of
charity
and
we
shall
see
that
they
are
types
all
these
sacrifices
and
ceremonies
were
then
either
types
or
nonsense
now
these
are
things
too
clear
and
too
lofty
to
be
thought
nonsense
to
know
if
the
prophets
confined
their
view
in
the
old
testament
or
saw
therein
other
things
the
key
of
the
cipher

the

is

gives
us
christ
must
suffer
an
humiliated
god
circumcision

true

a

the

have
shown
that
all
these
must
be
spiritual
not
the
meat
which
perishes
but
that
which
does
not
perish
ye
shall
be

indeed
then
the
other
freedom
was
only
a
type
of
freedom
i
am
the
true
bread
from

we
can
only
describe
a
good
character
by
reconciling
all
contrary
qualities
and
it
is
not
enough
to
keep
up
a
series
of
harmonious
qualities
without
reconciling
contradictory
ones
to
understand
the
meaning
of
an
author
we
must
make
all
the
contrary
passages
agree
thus
to
understand
scripture
we
must
have
a
meaning
in
which
all
the
contrary
passages
are
reconciled
it
is
not
enough
to
have
one
which
suits
many
concurring
passages
but
it
is
necessary
to
have
one
which
reconciles
even
contradictory
passages
every
author
has
a
meaning
in
which
all
the
contradictory
passages
agree
or
he
has
no
meaning
at
all
we
can
not
affirm
the
latter
of
scripture
and
the
prophets
they
undoubtedly
are
full
of
good
sense
we
must
then
seek
for
a
meaning
which
reconciles
all
discrepancies
the
true
meaning
then
is
not
that
of
the
jews
but
in
jesus
christ
all
the
contradictions
are
reconciled
the
jews
could
not
reconcile
the
cessation
of
the
royalty
and
principality
foretold
by
hosea
with
the
prophecy
of
jacob
if
we
take
the
law
the
sacrifices
and
the
kingdom
as
realities
we
can
not
reconcile
all
the
passages
they
must
then
necessarily
be
only
types
we
can
not
even
reconcile
the
passages
of
the
same
author
nor
of
the
same
book
nor
sometimes
of
the
same
chapter
which
indicates
copiously
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
author
as
when
ezekiel
chap
xx
says
that
man
will
not
live
by
the
commandments
of
god
and
will
live
by
them
if
the
law
and
the
sacrifices
are
the
truth
it
must
please
god
and
must
not
displease
him
if
they
are
types
they
must
be
both
pleasing
and
displeasing
now
in
all
the
scripture
they
are
both
pleasing
and
displeasing
it
is
said
that
the
law
shall
be
changed
that
the
sacrifice
shall
be
changed
that
they
shall
be
without
law
without
a
prince
and
without
a
sacrifice
that
a
new
covenant
shall
be
made
that
the
law
shall
be
renewed
that
the
precepts
which
they
have
received
are
not
good
that
their
sacrifices
are
abominable
that
god
has
demanded
none
of
them
it
is
said
on
the
contrary
that
the
law
shall
abide
for
ever
that
this
covenant
shall
be
for
ever
that
sacrifice
shall
be
eternal
that
the
sceptre
shall
never
depart
from
among
them
because
it
shall
not
depart
from
them
till
the
eternal
king
comes
do
all
these
passages
indicate
what
is
real
no
do
they
then
indicate
what
is
typical
no
but
what
is
either
real
or
typical
but
the
first
passages
excluding
as
they
do
reality
indicate
that
all
this
is
only
typical
all
these
passages
together
can
not
be
applied
to
reality
all
can
be
said
to
be
typical
therefore
they
are
not
spoken
of
reality
but
of
the
type
occisus
est
ab
origine
a
sacrificing
judge
the
sceptre
till
the
messiah
without
king
or
prince
the
eternal
law
changed
the
eternal
covenant
a
new
covenant
good
laws
bad
precepts
ezekiel
when
the
word
of
god
which
is
really
true
is
false
literally
it
is
true
spiritually
a
dextris
meis
this
is
false
literally
therefore
it
is
true
spiritually
in
these
expressions
god
is
spoken
of
after
the
manner
of
men
and
this
means
nothing
else
but
that
the
intention
which
men
have
in
giving
a
seat
at
their
right
hand
god
will
have
also
it
is
then
an
indication
of
the
intention
of
god
not
of
his
manner
of
carrying
it
out
thus
when
it
is
said
god
has
received
the
odour
of
your
incense
and
will
in
recompense
give
you
a
rich
land
that
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
the
same
intention
which
a
man
would
have
who
pleased
with
your
perfumes
should
in
recompense
give
you
a
rich
land
god
will
have
towards
you
because
you
have
had
the
same
intention
as
a
man
has
towards
him
to
whom
he
presents
perfumes
so
a
jealous
god
etc
for
the
things
of
god
being
inexpressible
they
can
not
be
spoken
of
otherwise
and
the
church
makes
use
of
them
even
confortavil
etc
it
is
not
allowable
to
attribute
to
scripture
the
meaning
which
is
not
revealed
to
us
that
it
has
thus
to
say
that
the
closed
of
isaiah
signifies
six
hundred
has
not
been
revealed
it
might
be
said
that
the
final
and
may
signify
mysteries
but
it
is
not
allowable
to
say
so
and
still
less
to
say
this
is
the
way
of
the
philosopher
stone
but
we
say
that
the
literal
meaning
is
not
the
true
meaning
because
the
prophets
have
themselves
said
so
i
do
not
say
that
the
is
mystical
moses
deut
xxx
promises
that
god
will
circumcise
their
heart
to
render
them
capable
of
loving
him
one
saying
of
david
or
of
moses
as
for
instance
that
god
will
circumcise
the
heart
enables
us
to
judge
of
their
spirit
if
all
their
other
expressions
were
ambiguous
and
left
us
in
doubt
whether
they
were
philosophers
or
christians
one
saying
of
this
kind
would
in
fact
determine
all
the
rest
as
one
sentence
of
epictetus
decides
the
meaning
of
all
the
rest
to
be
the
opposite
so
far
ambiguity
exists
but
not
afterwards
if
one
of
two
persons
who
are
telling
silly
stories
uses
language
with
a
double
meaning
understood
in
his
own
circle
while
the
other
uses
it
with
only
one
meaning
any
one
not
in
the
secret
who
hears
them
both
talk
in
this
manner
will
pass
upon
them
the
same
judgment
but
if
afterwards
in
the
rest
of
their
conversation
one
says
angelic
things
and
the
other
always
dull
commonplaces
he
will
judge
that
the
one
spoke
in
mysteries
and
not
the
other
the
one
having
sufficiently
shown
that
he
is
incapable
of
such
foolishness
and
capable
of
being
mysterious
and
the
other
that
he
is
incapable
of
mystery
and
capable
of
foolishness
the
old
testament
is
a
cipher
there
are
some
that
see
clearly
that
man
has
no
other
enemy
than
lust
which
turns
him
from
god
and
not
god
and
that
he
has
no
other
good
than
god
and
not
a
rich
land
let
those
who
believe
that
the
good
of
man
is
in
the
flesh
and
evil
in
what
turns
him
away
from
sensual
pleasures
themselves
with
them
and
in
them
but
let
those
who
seek
god
with
all
their
heart
who
are
only
troubled
at
not
seeing
him
who
desire
only
to
possess
him
and
have
as
enemies
only
those
who
turn
them
away
from
him
who
are
grieved
at
seeing
themselves
surrounded
and
overwhelmed
with
such
enemies
take
comfort
i
proclaim
to
them
happy
news
there
exists
a
redeemer
for
them
i
shall
show
him
to
them
i
shall
show
that
there
is
a
god
for
them
i
shall
not
show
him
to
others
i
shall
make
them
see
that
a
messiah
has
been
promised
who
should
deliver
them
from
their
enemies
and
that
one
has
come
to
free
them
from
their
iniquities
but
not
from
their
enemies
when
david
foretold
that
the
messiah
would
deliver
his
people
from
their
enemies
one
can
believe
that
in
the
flesh
these
would
be
the
egyptians
and
then
i
can
not
show
that
the
prophecy
was
fulfilled
but
one
can
well
believe
also
that
the
enemies
would
be
their
sins
for
indeed
the
egyptians
were
not
their
enemies
but
their
sins
were
so
this
word
enemies
is
therefore
ambiguous
but
if
he
says
elsewhere
as
he
does
that
he
will
deliver
his
people
from
their
sins
as
indeed
do
isaiah
and
others
the
ambiguity
is
removed
and
the
double
meaning
of
enemies
is
reduced
to
the
simple
meaning
of
iniquities
for
if
he
had
sins
in
his
mind
he
could
well
denote
them
as
enemies
but
if
he
thought
of
enemies
he
could
not
designate
them
as
iniquities
now
moses
david
and
isaiah
used
the
same
terms
who
will
say
then
that
they
have
not
the
same
meaning
and
that
david
meaning
which
is
plainly
iniquities
when
he
spoke
of
enemies
was
not
the
same
as
moses
when
speaking
of
enemies
daniel
ix
prays
for
the
deliverance
of
the
people
from
the
captivity
of
their
enemies
but
he
was
thinking
of
sins
and
to
show
this
he
says
that
gabriel
came
to
tell
him
that
his
prayer
was
heard
and
that
there
were
only
seventy
weeks
to
wait
after
which
the
people
would
be
freed
from
iniquity
sin
would
have
an
end
and
the
redeemer
the
holy
of
holies
would
bring
justice
not
legal
but
eternal
section
xi
the
prophecies
when
i
see
the
blindness
and
the
wretchedness
of
man
when
i
regard
the
whole
silent
universe
and
man
without
light
left
to
himself
and
as
it
were
lost
in
this
corner
of
the
universe
without
knowing
who
has
put
him
there
what
he
has
come
to
do
what
will
become
of
him
at
death
and
incapable
of
all
knowledge
i
become
terrified
like
a
man
who
should
be
carried
in
his
sleep
to
a
dreadful
desert
island
and
should
awake
without
knowing
where
he
is
and
without
means
of
escape
and
thereupon
i
wonder
how
people
in
a
condition
so
wretched
do
not
fall
into
despair
i
see
other
persons
around
me
of
a
like
nature
i
ask
them
if
they
are
better
informed
than
i
am
they
tell
me
that
they
are
not
and
thereupon
these
wretched
and
lost
beings
having
looked
around
them
and
seen
some
pleasing
objects
have
given
and
attached
themselves
to
them
for
my
own
part
i
have
not
been
able
to
attach
myself
to
them
and
considering
how
strongly
it
appears
that
there
is
something
else
than
what
i
see
i
have
examined
whether
this
god
has
not
left
some
sign
of
himself
i
see
many
contradictory
religions
and
consequently
all
false
save
one
each
wants
to
be
believed
on
its
own
authority
and
threatens
unbelievers
i
do
not
therefore
believe
them
every
one
can
say
this
every
one
can
call
himself
a
prophet
but
i
see
that
christian
religion
wherein
prophecies
are
fulfilled
and
that
is
what
every
one
can
not
do
and
what
crowns
all
this
is
prediction
so
that
it
should
not
be
said
that
it
is
chance
which
has
done
it
whosoever
having
only
a
week
to
live
will
not
find
out
that
it
is
expedient
to
believe
that
all
this
is
not
a
stroke
of
chance
now
if
the
passions
had
no
hold
on
us
a
week
and
a
hundred
years
would
amount
to
the
same
thing
great
pan

verbum

we
understand
the
prophecies
only
when
we
see
the
events
happen
thus
the
proofs
of
retreat
discretion
silence
etc
are
proofs
only
to
those
who
know
and
believe
them
joseph
so
internal
in
a
law
so
external
outward
penances
dispose
to
inward
as
humiliations
to
humility
thus
the
the
synagogue
has
preceded
the
church
the
jews
the
christians
the
prophets
have
foretold
the
christians
saint
john
jesus
christ
it
is
glorious
to
see
with
the
eyes
of
faith
the
history
of
herod
and
of
cæsar
the
zeal
of
the
jews
for
their
law
and
their
temple
josephus
and
philo
the
jew
what
other
people
had
such
a
zeal
it
was
necessary
they
should
have
it
jesus
christ
foretold
as
to
the
time
and
the
state
of
the
world
the
ruler
taken
from
the
thigh
and
the
fourth
monarchy
how
lucky
we
are
to
see
this
light
amidst
this
darkness
how
fine
it
is
to
see
with
the
eyes
of
faith
darius
and
cyrus
alexander
the
romans
pompey
and
herod
working
without
knowing
it
for
the
glory
of
the
gospel
zeal
of
the
jewish
people
for
the
law
especially
after
there
were
no
more
prophets
while
the
prophets
were
for
maintaining
the
law
the
people
were
indifferent
but
since
there
have
been
no
more
prophets
zeal
has
succeeded
them
the
devil
troubled
the
zeal
of
the
jews
before
jesus
christ
because
he
would
have
been
their
salvation
but
not
since
the
jewish
people
scorned
by
the
gentiles
the
christian
people
persecuted
prophecies
with
their
fulfilment
what
has
preceded
and
what
has
followed
jesus
christ
the
prophecies
are
the
strongest
proof
of
jesus
christ
it
is
for
them
also
that
god
has
made
most
provision
for
the
event
which
has
fulfilled
them
is
a
miracle
existing
since
the
birth
of
the
church
to
the
end
so
god
has
raised
up
prophets
during
sixteen
hundred
years
and
during
four
hundred
years
afterwards
he
has
scattered
all
these
prophecies
among
all
the
jews
who
carried
them
into
all
parts
of
the
world
such
was
the
preparation
for
the
birth
of
jesus
christ
and
as
his
gospel
was
to
be
believed
by
all
the
world
it
was
not
only
necessary
that
there
should
be
prophecies
to
make
it
believed
but
that
these
prophecies
should
exist
throughout
the
whole
world
in
order
to
make
it
embraced
by
the
whole
world
but
it
was
not
enough
that
the
prophecies
should
exist
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
distributed
throughout
all
places
and
preserved
throughout
all
times
and
in
order
that
this
agreement
might
not
be
taken
for
an
effect
of
chance
it
was
necessary
that
this
should
be
foretold
it
is
far
more
glorious
for
the
messiah
that
the
jews
should
be
the
spectators
and
even
the
instruments
of
his
glory
besides
that
god
had
reserved
them
the
time
foretold
by
the
state
of
the
jewish
people
by
the
state
of
the
heathen
by
the
state
of
the
temple
by
the
number
of
years
one
must
be
bold
to
predict
the
same
thing
in
so
many
ways
it
was
necessary
that
the
four
idolatrous
or
pagan
monarchies
the
end
of
the
kingdom
of
judah
and
the
seventy
weeks
should
happen
at
the
same
time
and
all
this
before
the
second
temple
was
destroyed
if
one
man
alone
had
made
a
book
of
predictions
about
jesus
christ
as
to
the
time
and
the
manner
and
jesus
christ
had
come
in
conformity
to
these
prophecies
this
fact
would
have
infinite
weight
but
there
is
much
more
here
here
is
a
succession
of
men
during
four
thousand
years
who
consequently
and
without
variation
come
one
after
another
to
foretell
this
same
event
here
is
a
whole
people
who
announce
it
and
who
have
existed
for
four
thousand
years
in
order
to
give
corporate
testimony
of
the
assurances
which
they
have
and
from
which
they
can
not
be
diverted
by
whatever
threats
and
persecutions
people
may
make
against
them
this
is
far
more
important
of
particular
they
were
strangers
in
egypt
without
any
private
property
either
in
that
country
or
elsewhere
there
was
not
the
least
appearance
either
of
the
royalty
which
had
previously
existed
so
long
or
of
that
supreme
council
of
seventy
judges
which
they
called
the
and
which
having
been
instituted
by
moses
lasted
to
the
time
of
jesus
christ
all
these
things
were
as
far
removed
from
their
state
at
that
time
as
they
could
be
when
jacob
dying
and
blessing
his
twelve
children
declared
to
them
that
they
would
be
proprietors
of
a
great
land
and
foretold
in
particular
to
the
family
of
judah
that
the
kings
who
would
one
day
rule
them
should
be
of
his
race
and
that
all
his
brethren
should
be
their
subjects
and
that
even
the
messiah
who
was
to
be
the
expectation
of
nations
should
spring
from
him
and
that
the
kingship
should
not
be
taken
away
from
judah
nor
the
ruler
and
of
his
descendants
till
the
expected
messiah
should
arrive
in
his
family
this
same
jacob
disposing
of
this
future
land
as
though
he
had
been
its
ruler
gave
a
portion
to
joseph
more
than
to
the
others
i
give
you
said
he
one
part
more
than
to
your
brothers
and
blessing
his
two
children
ephraim
and
manasseh
whom
joseph
had
presented
to
him
the
elder
manasseh
on
his
right
and
the
young
ephraim
on
his
left
he
put
his
arms
crosswise
and
placing
his
right
hand
on
the
head
of
ephraim
and
his
left
on
manasseh
he
blessed
them
in
this
manner
and
upon
joseph
representing
to
him
that
he
was
preferring
the
younger
he
replied
to
him
with
admirable
resolution
i
know
it
well
my
son
but
ephraim
will
increase
more
than
manasseh
this
has
been
indeed
so
true
in
the
result
that
being
alone
almost
as
fruitful
as
the
two
entire
lines
which
composed
a
whole
kingdom
they
have
been
usually
called
by
the
name
of
ephraim
alone
this
same
joseph
when
dying
bade
his
children
carry
his
bones
with
them
when
they
should
go
into
that
land
to
which
they
only
came
two
hundred
years
afterwards
moses
who
wrote
all
these
things
so
long
before
they
happened
himself
assigned
to
each
family
portions
of
that
land
before
they
entered
it
as
though
he
had
been
its
ruler
in
fact
he
declared
that
god
was
to
raise
up
from
their
nation
and
their
race
a
prophet
of
whom
he
was
the
type
and
he
foretold
them
exactly
all
that
was
to
happen
to
them
in
the
land
which
they
were
to
enter
after
his
death
the
victories
which
god
would
give
them
their
ingratitude
towards
god
the
punishments
which
they
would
receive
for
it
and
the
rest
of
their
adventures
he
gave
them
judges
who
should
make
the
division
he
prescribed
the
entire
form
of
political
government
which
they
should
observe
the
cities
of
refuge
which
they
should
build
and
the
prophecies
about
particular
things
are
mingled
with
those
about
the
messiah
so
that
the
prophecies
of
the
messiah
should
not
be
without
proofs
nor
the
special
prophecies
without
fruit

the

the
last
verse

temporal
blessings
says
who
is
wise
and
he
shall
understand
these
things
and
the
visions
of
all
the

become
unto
you
as
a

which
men
deliver
to
one
that
is
learned
and
who
can
read
and
he
saith
i
can
not
read
it
for
it
is
sealed
and
when
the
book
is
delivered
to
them
that
are
not
learned
they
say
i
am
not
learned
wherefore
the
lord
said
forasmuch
as
this
people
with
their
lips
do
honour
me
but
have
removed
their
heart
far
from
me
there
is
the
reason
and
the
cause
of
it
for
if
they
adored
god
in
their
hearts
they
would
understand
the
prophecies
and
their
fear
towards
me
is
taught
by
the

thy

from

that
thine

a

me
to
anger
continually
by
the

out

you
have
forgotten
your
god
to

strange

and
ye
did
not
answer
i
spake
and
ye
did
not

behold
my

ye
shall
be
hungry
my
servants
shall
rejoice
but
ye
shall
be

my

ye
shall
cry
and

for
vexation

spirit
and
ye
shall
leave
your

for
a

unto
my
chosen
for
the

shall
slay
thee
and
call
his

that
he
who
blesseth

because
the

behold
i
create
jerusalem

and
her

i

rejoice
in

the
voice
of
weeping
shall
no

the
voice
of
crying
before
they
call
i
will
answer
and
while
they
are

speaking
i
will
hear
the
wolf
and
the

shall
eat
straw
like

they

keep
ye
judgment
and
do
justice
for
my
salvation
is
near

my
righteousness
to
be

blessed
is
the
man
that
doeth
this
that
keepeth
the

keepeth
his
hand
from
doing
any
evil
neither
let
the
strangers
that
have
joined
themselves
to
me
say
god
will
separate
me
from

thus
saith
the
lord
whoever
will
keep
my
sabbath
and
choose
the
things
that
please
me
and
take
hold
of
my
covenant
even
unto
them
will
i
give
in
mine
house
a
place
and
a
name
better
than
that
of
sons
and
of
daughters
i
will
give
them
an
everlasting
name
that
shall
not

therefore
for
our
iniquities

far
from

we

ye

unto

all
thy
soothsayers
and
wise
men
can
not
shew
unto
thee
the
secret
which
thou
hast
demanded
but
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
who
can
do
so
and
that
hath
revealed
to
thee
in
thy
dream
what
shall
be
in
the
latter
days
this
dream
must
have
caused
him
much
misgiving
and
it
is
not
by
my
own
wisdom
that
i
have
knowledge
of
this
secret
but
by
the
revelation
of
this
same
god
that
hath
revealed
it
to
me
to
make
it
manifest
in
thy
presence
thy
dream
was
then
of
this
kind
thou
sawest
a
great
image
high
and
terrible
which
stood
before
thee
his
head
was
of
gold
his
breast
and
arms
of
silver
his
belly
and
his
thighs
of
brass
his
legs
of
iron
his
feet
part
of
iron
and
part
of
clay
thus
thou
sawest
till
that
a
stone
was
cut
out
without
hands
which
smote
the
image
upon
his
feet
that
were
of
iron
and
of
clay
and
brake
them
to
pieces
then
was
the
iron
the
clay
the
brass
the
silver
and
the
gold
broken
to
pieces
together
and
the
wind
carried
them
away
but
this
stone
that
smote
the
image
became
a
great
mountain
and
filled
the
whole
earth
this
is
the
dream
and
now
i
will
give
thee
the
interpretation
thereof
thou
who
art
the
greatest
of
kings
and
to
whom
god
hath
given
a
power
so
vast
that
thou
art
renowned
among
all
peoples
art
the
head
of
gold
which
thou
hast
seen
but
after
thee
shall
arise
another
kingdom
inferior
to
thee
and
another
third
kingdom
of
brass
which
shall
bear
rule
over
all
the
earth
but
the
fourth
kingdom
shall
be
strong
as
iron
and
even
as
iron
breaketh
in
pieces
and
subdueth
all
things
so
shall
this
empire
break
in
pieces
and
bruise
all
and
whereas
thou
sawest
the
feet
and
toes
part
of
clay
and
part
of
iron
the
kingdom
shall
be
divided
but
there
shall
be
in
it
of
the
strength
of
iron
and
of
the
weakness
of
clay
but
as
iron
can
not
be
firmly
mixed
with
clay
so
they
who
are
represented
by
the
iron
and
by
the
clay
shall
not
cleave
one
to
another
though
united
by
marriage
now
in
the
days
of
these
kings
shall
god
set
up
a
kingdom
which
shall
never
be
destroyed
nor
ever
be
delivered
up
to
other
people
it
shall
break
in
pieces
and
consume
all
these
kingdoms
and
it
shall
stand
for
ever
according
as
thou
sawest
that
the
stone
was
cut
out
of
the
mountain
without
hands
and
that
it
fell
from
the
mountain
and
brake
in
pieces
the
iron
the
clay
the
silver
and
the
gold
god
hath
made
known
to
thee
what
shall
come
to
pass
hereafter
this
dream
is
certain
and
the
interpretation
thereof
sure

daniel

daniel
having
seen
the
combat
of
the
ram
and
of
the
who
vanquished
him
and
ruled
over
the
earth
whereof
the
principal
horn
being
broken
four
others
came
up
toward
the
four
winds
of
heaven
and
out
of
one
of
them
came
forth
a
little
horn
which
waxed
exceedingly
great
toward
the
south
and
toward
the
east
and
toward
the
land
of
israel
and
it
waxed
great
even
to
the
host
of
heaven
and
it
cast
down
some
of
the
stars
and
stamped
upon
them
and
at
last
overthrew
the
prince
and
by
him
the
daily
sacrifice
was
taken
away
and
the
place
of
his
sanctuary
was
cast
down
this
is
what
daniel
saw
he
sought
the
meaning
of
it
and
a
voice
cried
in
this
manner
make
this
man
to
understand
the
vision
and
gabriel
said
the
ram
which
thou
sawest
is
the
king
of
the
medes
and
persians
and
the
is
the
king
of
greece
and
the
great
horn
that
is
between
his
eyes
is
the
first
king
of
this
monarchy
now
that
being
broken
whereas
four
stood
up
for
it
four
kingdoms
shall
stand
up
out
of
the
nation
but
not
in
his
power
and
in
the
latter
time
of
their
kingdom
when
iniquities
are
come
to
the
full
there
shall
arise
a
king
insolent
and
strong
but
not
by
his
own
power
to
whom
all
things
shall
succeed
after
his
own
will
and
he
shall
destroy
the
holy
people
and
through
his
policy
also
he
shall
cause
craft
to
prosper
in
his
hand
and
he
shall
destroy
many
he
shall
also
stand
up
against
the
prince
of
princes
but
he
shall
perish
miserably
and
nevertheless
by
a
violent
hand

so
he
shall
return
into
his
kingdom
but
his
sons
shall
be
stirred
up
and
shall
assemble
a
multitude
of
great
forces
seleucus
ceraunus
antiochus
the
great
and
their
army
shall
come
and
overthrow
all
wherefore
the
king
of
the
south
shall
be
moved
with
choler
and
shall
also
form
a
great
army
and
fight
him
ptolemy
philopator
against
antiochus
the
great
at
raphia
and
conquer
and
his
troops
shall
become
insolent
and
his
heart
shall
be
lifted
up
this
ptolemy
desecrated
the
temple
josephus
he
shall
cast
down
many
ten
thousands
but
he
shall
not
be
strengthened
by
it
for
the
king
of
the
north
antiochus
the
great
shall
return
with
a
greater
multitude
than
before
and
in
those
times
also
a
great
number
of
enemies
shall
stand
up
against
the
king
of
the
south
during
the
reign
of
the
young
ptolemy
epiphanes
also
the
apostates
and
robbers
of
thy
people
shall
exalt
themselves
to
establish
the
vision
but
they
shall
fall
those
who
abandon
their
religion
to
please
euergetes
when
he
will
send
his
troops
to
scopas
for
antiochus
will
again
take
scopas
and
conquer
them
and
the
king
of
the
north
shall
destroy
the
fenced
cities
and
the
arms
of
the
south
shall
not
withstand
and
all
shall
yield
to
his
will
he
shall
stand
in
the
land
of
israel
and
it
shall
yield
to
him
and
thus
he
shall
think
to
make
himself
master
of
all
the
empire
of
egypt
despising
the
youth
of
epiphanes
says
justin
and
for
that
he
shall
make
alliance
with
him
and
give
his
daughter
cleopatra
in
order
that
she
may
betray
her
husband
on
which
appian
says
that
doubting
his
ability
to
make
himself
master
of
egypt
by
force
because
of
the
protection
of
the
romans
he
wished
to
attempt
it
by
cunning
he
shall
wish
to
corrupt
her
but
she
shall
not
stand
on
his
side
neither
be
for
him
then
he
shall
turn
his
face
to
other
designs
and
shall
think
to
make
himself
master
of
some
isles
that
is
to
say
seaports
and
shall
take
many
as
appian
says
but
a
prince
shall
oppose
his
conquests
scipio
africanus
who
stopped
the
progress
of
antiochus
the
great
because
he
offended
the
romans
in
the
person
of
their
allies
and
shall
cause
the
reproach
offered
by
him
to
cease
he
shall
then
return
into
his
kingdom
and
there
perish
and
be
no
more
he
was
slain
by
his
soldiers
and
he
who
shall
stand
up
in
his
estate
seleucus
philopator
or
soter
the
son
of
antiochus
the
great
shall
be
a
tyrant
a
raiser
of
taxes
in
the
glory
of
the
kingdom
which
means
the
people
but
within
a
few
days
he
shall
be
destroyed
neither
in
anger
nor
in
battle
and
in
his
place
shall
stand
up
a
vile
person
unworthy
of
the
honour
of
the
kingdom
but
he
shall
come
in
cleverly
by
flatteries
all
armies
shall
bend
before
him
he
shall
conquer
them
and
even
the
prince
with
whom
he
has
made
a
covenant
for
having
renewed
the
league
with
him
he
shall
work
deceitfully
and
enter
with
a
small
people
into
his
province
peaceably
and
without
fear
he
shall
take
the
fattest
places
and
shall
do
that
which
his
fathers
have
not
done
and
ravage
on
all
sides
he
shall
forecast
great
devices
during
his
time
the
seventy
weeks
of
daniel
are
ambiguous
as
regards
the
term
of
commencement
because
of
the
terms
of
the
prophecy
and
as
regards
the
term
of
conclusion
because
of
the
differences
among
chronologists
but
all
this
difference
extends
only
to
two
hundred
years
that
in
the
fourth
monarchy
before
the
destruction
of
the
second
temple
before
the
dominion
of
the
jews
was
taken
away
in
the
seventieth
week
of
daniel
during
the
continuance
of
the
second
temple
the
heathen
should
be
instructed
and
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
god
worshipped
by
the
jews
that
those
who
loved
him
should
be
delivered
from
their
enemies
and
filled
with
his
fear
and
love
and
it
happened
that
in
the
fourth
monarchy
before
the
destruction
of
the
second
temple
the
heathen
in
great
number
worshipped
god
and
led
an
angelic
life
maidens
dedicated
their
virginity
and
their
life
to
god
men
renounced
their
pleasures
what
plato
could
only
make
acceptable
to
a
few
men
specially
chosen
and
instructed
a
secret
influence
imparted
by
the
power
of
a
few
words
to
a
hundred
million
ignorant
men
the
rich
left
their
wealth
children
left
the
dainty
homes
of
their
parents
to
go
into
the
rough
desert
see
philo
the
jew
all
this
was
foretold
a
great
while
ago
for
two
thousand
years
no
heathen
had
worshipped
the
god
of
the
jews
and
at
the
time
foretold
a
great
number
of
the
heathen
worshipped
this
only
god
the
temples
were
destroyed
the
very
kings
made
submission
to
the
cross
all
this
was
due
to
the
spirit
of
god
which
was
spread
abroad
upon
the
earth
no
heathen
since
moses
until
jesus
christ
believed
according
to
the
very
rabbis
a
great
number
of
the
heathen
after
jesus
christ
believed
in
the
books
of
moses
kept
them
in
substance
and
spirit
and
only
rejected
what
was
useless
the
conversion
of
the
egyptians
isaiah
xix
an
altar
in
egypt
to
the
true
god
it
is
a
tradition
among
us
that
when
the
messiah
shall
come
the
house
of
god
destined
for
the
dispensation
of
his
word
shall
be
full
of
filth
and
impurity
and
that
the
wisdom
of
the
scribes
shall
be
corrupt
and
rotten
those
who
shall
be
afraid
to
sin
shall
be
rejected
by
the
people
and
treated
as
senseless
fools
is
xlix
listen
o
isles
unto
me
and
hearken
ye
people
from
afar
the
lord
hath
called
me
by
my
name
from
the
womb
of
my
mother
in
the
shadow
of
his
hand
hath
he
hid
me
and
hath
made
my
words
like
a
sharp
sword
and
said
unto
me
thou
art
my
servant
in
whom
i
will
be
glorified
then
i
said
lord
have
i
laboured
in
vain
have
i
spent
my
strength
for
nought
yet
surely
my
judgment
is
with
thee
o
lord
and
my
work
with
thee
and
now
saith
the
lord
that
formed
me
from
the
womb
to
be
his
servant
to
bring
jacob
and
israel
again
to
him
thou
shalt
be
glorious
in
my
sight
and
i
will
be
thy
strength
it
is
a
light
thing
that
thou
shouldst
convert
the
tribes
of
jacob
i
have
raised
thee
up
for
a
light
to
the
gentiles
that
thou
mayest
be
my
salvation
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
thus
saith
the
lord
to
him
whom
man
despiseth
to
him
whom
the
nation
abhorreth
to
a
servant
of
rulers
princes
and
kings
shall
worship
thee
because
the
lord
is
faithful
that
hath
chosen
thee
again
saith
the
lord
unto
me
i
have
heard
thee
in
the
days
of
salvation
and
of
mercy
and
i
will
preserve
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
to
cause
to
inherit
the
desolate
nations
that
thou
mayest
say
to
the
prisoners
go
forth
to
them
that

yourselves
and
possess
these
abundant
and
fertile
lands
they
shall
not
hunger
nor
thirst
neither
shall
the
heat
nor
sun
smite
them
for
he
that
hath
mercy
upon
them
shall
lead
them
even
by
the
springs
of
waters
shall
he
guide
them
and
make
the
mountains
a
way
before
them

come
from

parts
from

from

let

let
the

for
it
hath
pleased
the

to
comfort
his
people
and
he
will
have
mercy
upon
the
poor
who
hope
in
him
yet
sion
dared
to
say
the
lord
hath
forsaken
me
and
hath
forgotten
me
can
a
woman
forget
her
child
that
she
should
not
have
compassion
on
the
son
of
her
womb
but
if
she
forget
yet
will
not
i
forget
thee
o
sion
i
will
bear
thee
always
between
my
hands
and
thy
walls
are
continually
before
me
they
that
shall
build
thee
are
come
and
thy
destroyers
shall
go
forth
of
thee
lift
up
thine
eyes
round
about
and
behold
all
these
gather
themselves
together
and
come
to
thee
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
thou
shalt
surely
clothe
thee
with
them
all
as
with
an
ornament
thy
waste
and
thy
desolate
places
and
the
land
of
thy
destruction
shall
even
now
be
too
narrow
by
reason
of
the
inhabitants
and
the
children
thou
shalt
have
after
thy
barrenness
shall
say
again
in
thy
ears
the
place
is
too
strait
for
me
give
place
to
me
that
i
may
dwell
then
shalt
thou
say
in
thy
heart
who
hath
begotten
me
these
seeing
i
have
lost
my
children
and
am
desolate
a
captive
and
removing
to
and
fro
and
who
brought
up
these
behold
i
was
left
alone
these
where
had
they
been
and
the
lord
shall
say
to
thee
behold
i
will
lift
up
mine
hand
to
the
gentiles
and
set
up
my
standard
to
the
people
and
they
shall
bring
thy
sons
in
their
arms
and
in
their
bosoms
and
kings
shall
be
their
nursing
fathers
and
queens
their
nursing
mothers
they
shall
bow
down
to
thee
with
their
face
toward
the
earth
and
lick
up
the
dust
of
thy
feet
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
for
they
shall
not
be
ashamed
that
wait
for
me
shall
the
prey
be
taken
from
the
mighty
but
even
if
the
captives
be
taken
away
from
the
strong
nothing
shall
hinder
me
from
saving
thy
children
and
from
destroying
thy
enemies
and
all
flesh
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
thy
saviour
and
thy
redeemer
the
mighty
one
of
jacob
thus
saith
the
lord
what
is
the
bill
of
this
divorcement
wherewith
i
have
put
away
the
synagogue
and
why
have
i
delivered
it
into
the
hands
of
your
enemies
is
it
not
for
your
iniquities
and
for
your
transgressions
that
i
have
put
it
away
for
i
came
and
no
man
received
me
i
called
and
there
was
none
to
hear
is
my
arm
shortened
that
i
can
not
redeem
therefore
i
will
show
the
tokens
of
mine
anger
i
will
clothe
the
heavens
with
darkness
and
make
sackcloth
their
covering
the
lord
hath
given
me
the
tongue
of
the
learned
that
i
should
know
how
to
speak
a
word
in
season
to
him
that
is
weary
he
hath
opened
mine
ear
and
i
have
listened
to
him
as
a
master
the
lord
hath
revealed
his
will
and
i
was
not
rebellious
i
gave
my
body
to
the
smiters
and
my
cheeks
to
outrage
i
hid
not
my
face
from
shame
and
spitting
but
the
lord
hath
helped
me
therefore
i
have
not
been
confounded
he
is
near
that
justifieth
me
who
will
contend
with
me
who
will
be
mine
adversary
and
accuse
me
of
sin
god
himself
being
my
protector
all
men
shall
pass
away
and
be
consumed
by
time
let
those
that
fear
god
hearken
to
the
voice
of
his
servant
let
him
that
languisheth
in
darkness
put
his
trust
in
the
lord
but
as
for
you
ye
do
but
kindle
the
wrath
of
god
upon
you
ye
walk
in
the
light
of
your
fire
and
in
the
sparks
that
ye
have
kindled
this

ye

unto

called
him

i
have
comforted
zion
and
heaped
upon
her
blessings
and
consolations
hearken
unto
me
my
people
and
give
ear
unto
me
for
a
law
shall
proceed
from
me
and
i
will
make
my
judgment
to
rest
for
a
light
of
the
gentiles
amos
viii
the
prophet
having
enumerated
the
sins
of
israel
said
that

sworn
to
take
vengeance
on
them

this
and
it

in
that
day
saith
the

that
i
will
cause
the
sun
to
go
down
at

darken
the

turn
your
feasts
into
mourning
and
all
your
songs
into
lamentation
you
all
shall
have
sorrow
and
suffering
and
i
will
make
this
nation
mourn
as
for
an
only
son
and
the
end
therefore
as
a
bitter
day
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
send
a
famine
in
the
land
not
a
famine
of
bread
nor
a
thirst
for
water

they
shall
wander
from

from

even
to

they
shall
run
to

to
seek
the

it
in

day
shall
the

faint
for

that
have
followed
the

that
among

in

places

would
be
offered

pure

destroying

also
the
worship

made

your
all
that
is
the
same
thing
to
prophesy
is
to
speak
of
god
not
from
outward
proofs
but
from
an
inward
and
immediate
feeling
that
he
would
teach
men
the
perfect
way
and
there
has
never
come
before
him
nor
after
him
any
man
who
has
taught
anything
divine
approaching
to
this
that
jesus
christ
would
be
small
in
his
beginning
and
would
then
increase
the
little
stone
of
daniel
if
i
had
in
no
wise
heard
of
the
messiah
nevertheless
after
such
wonderful
predictions
of
the
course
of
the
world
which
i
see
fulfilled
i
see
that
he
is
divine
and
if
i
knew
that
these
same
books
foretold
a
messiah
i
should
be
sure
that
he
would
come
and
seeing
that
they
place
his
time
before
the
destruction
of
the
second
temple
i
should
say
that
he
had
come
that
the
jews
would
reject
jesus
christ
and
would
be
rejected
of
god
for
this
reason
that
the
chosen
vine
brought
forth
only
wild
grapes
that
the
chosen
people
would
be
fruitless
ungrateful
and
unbelieving
non
credentem

that
god
would
strike
them
with
blindness
and
in
full
noon
they
would
grope
like
the

that
a
forerunner
would
go
before
him

a

there
should
be

would

there
should

it
should
be

the
christ
should
be
glorious
mighty
strong
and
yet
so
poor
that
he
would
not
be
recognised
nor
taken
for
what
he
is
but
rejected
and
slain
that
his
people
who
denied
him
should
no
longer
be
his
people

the
idolaters
should
receive
him
and
take
refuge
in
him

he
should
leave

reign
in

nevertheless
the

should
continue
for

should

should

a

section
xii
proofs
of
jesus
christ
therefore
i
reject
all
other
religions
in
that
way
i
find
an
answer
to
all
objections
it
is
right
that
a
god
so
pure
should
only
reveal
himself
to
those
whose
hearts
are
purified
hence
this
religion
is
lovable
to
me
and
i
find
it
now
sufficiently
justified
by
so
divine
a
morality
but
i
find
more
in
it
i
find
it
convincing
that
since
the
memory
of
man
has
lasted
it
was
constantly
announced
to
men
that
they
were
universally
corrupt
but
that
a
redeemer
should
come
that
it
was
not
one
man
who
said
it
but
innumerable
men
and
a
whole
nation
expressly
made
for
the
purpose
and
prophesying
for
four
thousand
years
this
is
a
nation
which
is
more
ancient
than
every
other
nation
their
books
scattered
abroad
are
four
thousand
years
old
the
more
i
examine
them
the
more
truths
i
find
in
them
an
entire
nation
foretell
him
before
his
advent
and
an
entire
nation
worship
him
after
his
advent
what
has
preceded
and
what
has
followed
in
short
people
without
idols
and
kings
this
synagogue
which
was
foretold
and
these
wretches
who
frequent
it
and
who
being
our
enemies
are
admirable
witnesses
of
the
truth
of
these
prophecies
wherein
their
wretchedness
and
even
their
blindness
are
foretold
i
find
this
succession
this
religion
wholly
divine
in
its
authority
in
its
duration
in
its
perpetuity
in
its
morality
in
its
conduct
in
its
doctrine
in
its
effects
the
frightful
darkness
of
the
jews
was
foretold
palpans
in
meridie
dabitur

while
the
sceptre
was
still
in
the
hands
of
the
first
foreign
usurper
there
is
the
report
of
the
coming
of
jesus
christ
so
i
hold
out
my
arms
to
my
who
having
been
foretold
for
four
thousand
years
has
come
to
suffer
and
to
die
for
me
on
earth
at
the
time
and
under
all
the
circumstances
foretold
by
his
grace
i
await
death
in
peace
in
the
hope
of
being
eternally
united
to
him
yet
i
live
with
joy
whether
in
the
prosperity
which
it
pleases
him
to
bestow
upon
me
or
in
the
adversity
which
he
sends
for
my
good
and
which
he
has
taught
me
to
bear
by
his
example
the
prophecies
having
given
different
signs
which
should
all
happen
at
the
advent
of
the
messiah
it
was
necessary
that
all
these
signs
should
occur
at
the
same
time
so
it
was
necessary
that
the
fourth
monarchy
should
have
come
when
the
seventy
weeks
of
daniel
were
ended
and
that
the
sceptre
should
have
then
departed
from
judah
and
all
this
happened
without
any
difficulty
then
it
was
necessary
that
the
messiah
should
come
and
jesus
christ
then
came
who
was
called
the
messiah
and
all
this
again
was
without
difficulty
this
indeed
shows
the
truth
of
the
prophecies
the
prophets
foretold
and
were
not
foretold
the
saints
again
were
foretold
but
did
not
foretell
jesus
christ
both
foretold
and
was
foretold
jesus
christ
whom
the
two
testaments
regard
the
old
as
its
hope
the
new
as
its
model
and
both
as
their
centre
the
two
oldest
books
in
the
world
are
those
of
moses
and
job
the
one
a
jew
and
the
other
a
gentile
both
of
them
look
upon
jesus
christ
as
their
common
centre
and
object

relating
the
promises
of
god
to
abraham
jacob

his
prophecies

the
gospel
only
speaks
of
the
virginity
of
the
virgin
up
to
the
time
of
the
birth
of
jesus
christ
all
with
reference
to
jesus
christ
of
jesus
why
was
the
book
of
ruth
preserved
why
the
story
of
tamar
pray
that
ye
enter
not
into
temptation
it
is
dangerous
to
be
tempted
and
people
are
tempted
because
they
do
not
pray
tu
conversus
confirma
fratres
but
before
jesus
respexit
saint
peter
asks
permission
to
strike
malchus
and
strikes
before
hearing
the
answer
jesus
christ
replies
afterwards
the
word
which
the
jewish
mob
pronounced
as
if
by
chance
in
accusing
jesus
christ
before
pilate
afforded
pilate
a
reason
for
sending
jesus
christ
to
herod
and
thereby
the
mystery
was
accomplished
that
he
should
be
judged
by
jews
and
gentiles
chance
was
apparently
the
cause
of
the
accomplishment
of
the
mystery
those
who
have
a
difficulty
in
believing
seek
a
reason
in
the
fact
that
the
jews
do
not
believe
were
this
so
clear
say
they
why
did
the
jews
not
believe
and
they
almost
wish
that
they
had
believed
so
as
not
to
be
kept
back
by
the
example
of
their
refusal
but
it
is
their
very
refusal
that
is
the
foundation
of
our
faith
we
should
be
much
less
disposed
to
the
faith
if
they
were
on
our
side
we
should
then
have
a
more
ample
pretext
the
wonderful
thing
is
to
have
made
the
jews
great
lovers
of
the
things
foretold
and
great
enemies
of
their
fulfilment
the
jews
were
accustomed
to
great
and
striking
miracles
and
so
having
had
the
great
miracles
of
the
red
sea
and
of
the
land
of
canaan
as
an
epitome
of
the
great
deeds
of
their
messiah
they
therefore
looked
for
more
striking
miracles
of
which
those
of
moses
were
only
the
patterns
the
carnal
jews
and
the
heathen
have
their
calamities
and
christians
also
there
is
no
redeemer
for
the
heathen
for
they
do
not
so
much
as
hope
for
one
there
is
no
redeemer
for
the
jews
they
hope
for
him
in
vain
there
is
a
redeemer
only
for
christians
see
in
the
time
of
the
messiah
the
people
divided
themselves
the
spiritual
embraced
the
messiah
and
the
remained
to
serve
as
witnesses
of
him
if
this
was
clearly
foretold
to
the
jews
how
did
they
not
believe
it
or
why
were
they
not
destroyed
for
resisting
a
fact
so
clear
i
reply
in
the
first
place
it
was
foretold
both
that
they
would
not
believe
a
thing
so
clear
and
that
they
would
not
be
destroyed
and
nothing
is
more
to
the
glory
of
the
messiah
for
it
was
not
enough
that
there
should
be
prophets
their
prophets
must
be
kept
above
suspicion
now
etc
if
the
jews
had
all
been
converted
by
jesus
christ
we
should
have
none
but
questionable
witnesses
and
if
they
had
been
entirely
destroyed
we
should
have
no
witnesses
at
all
what
do
the
prophets
say
of
jesus
christ
that
he
will
be
clearly
god
no
but
that
he
is
a
god
truly
hidden
that
he
will
be
slighted
that
none
will
think
that
it
is
he
that
he
will
be
a
stone
of
stumbling
upon
which
many
will
stumble
etc
let
people
then
reproach
us
no
longer
for
want
of
clearness
since
we
make
profession
of
it
but
it
is
said
there
are
and
without
that
no
one
would
have
stumbled
over
jesus
christ
and
this
is
one
of
the
formal
pronouncements
of
the
prophets
moses
first
teaches
the
trinity
original
sin
the
messiah
david
a
great
witness
a
king
good
merciful
a
beautiful
soul
a
sound
mind
powerful
he
prophesies
and
his
wonder
comes
to
pass
this
is
infinite
he
had
only
to
say
that
he
was
the
messiah
if
he
had
been
vain
for
the
prophecies
are
clearer
about
him
than
about
jesus
christ
and
the
same
with
saint
john
herod
was
believed
to
be
the
messiah
he
had
taken
away
the
sceptre
from
judah
but
he
was
not
of
judah
this
gave
rise
to
a
considerable
sect
curse
of
the
greeks
upon
those
who
count
three
periods
of
time
in
what
way
should
the
messiah
come
seeing
that
through
him
the
sceptre
was
to
be
eternally
in
judah
and
at
his
coming
the
sceptre
was
to
be
taken
away
from
judah
in
order
to
effect
that
seeing
they
should
not
see
and
hearing
they
should
not
understand
nothing
could
be
better
done

the
apparent
discrepancy
of
the

what
can
we
have
but
reverence
for
a
man
who
foretells
plainly
things
which
come
to
pass
and
who
declares
his
intention
both
to
blind
and
to
enlighten
and
who
intersperses
obscurities

the
clear
things
which
come
to
pass
the
time
of
the
first
advent
was
foretold
the
time
of
the
second
is
not
so
because
the
first
was
to
be
obscure
and
the
second
is
to
be
brilliant
and
so
manifest
that
even
his
enemies
will
recognise
it
but
as
he
was
first
to
come
only
in
obscurity
and
to
be
known
only
of
those
who
searched
the
scriptures

in
order
to
cause
the
messiah
to
be
known
by
the
good
and
not
to
be
known
by
the
wicked
made
him
to
be
foretold
in
this
manner
if
the
manner
of
the
messiah
had
been
clearly
foretold
there
would
have
been
no
obscurity
even
for
the
wicked
if
the
time
had
been
obscurely
foretold
there
would
have
been
obscurity
even
for
the
good
for
their
goodness
of
heart

not
have
made
them
understand
for
instance
that
the
closed
signifies
six
hundred
years
but
the
time
has
been
clearly
foretold
and
the
manner
in
types
by
this
means
the
wicked
taking
the
promised
blessings
for
material
blessings
have
fallen
into
error
in
spite
of
the
clear
prediction
of
the
time
and
the
good
have
not
fallen
in
error
for
the
understanding
of
the
promised
blessings
depends
on
the
heart
which
calls
good
that
which
it
loves
but
the
understanding
of
the
promised
time
does
not
depend
on
the
heart
and
thus
the
clear
prediction
of
the
time
and
the
obscure
prediction
of
the
blessings
deceive
the
wicked
alone
either
the
jews
or
the
christians
must
be
wicked
the
jews
reject
him
but
not
all
the
saints
receive
him
and
not
the
and
so
far
is
this
from
being
against
his
glory
that
it
is
the
last
touch
which
crowns
it
for
their
argument
the
only
one
found
in
all
their
writings
in
the
talmud
and
in
the
rabbinical
writings
amounts
only
to
this
that
jesus
christ
has
not
subdued
the
nations
with
sword
in
hand
uum
is
this
all
they
have
to
say
jesus
christ
has
been
slain
say
they
he
has
failed
he
has
not
subdued
the
heathen
with
his
might
he
has
not
bestowed
upon
us
their
spoil
he
does
not
give
riches
is
this
all
they
have
to
say
it
is
in
this
respect
that
he
is
lovable
to
me
i
would
not
desire
him
whom
they
fancy
it
is
evident
that
it
is
only
his
life
which
has
prevented
them
from
accepting
him
and
through
this
rejection
they
are
irreproachable
witnesses
and
what
is
more
they
thereby
accomplish
the
prophecies
by
means
of
the
fact
that
this
people
have
not
accepted
him
this
miracle
here
has
happened
the
prophecies
were
the
only
lasting
miracles
which
could
be
wrought
but
they
were
liable
to
be
denied
the
jews
in
slaying
him
in
order
not
to
receive
him
as
the
messiah
have
given
him
the
final
proof
of
being
the
messiah
and
in
continuing
not
to
recognise
him
they
made
themselves
irreproachable
witnesses
both
in
slaying
him
and
in
continuing
to
deny
him
they
have
fulfilled
the
prophecies
isa
lx
ps
lxxi
what
could
the
jews
his
enemies
do
if
they
receive
him
they
give
proof
of
him
by
their
reception
for
then
the
guardians
of
the
expectation
of
the
messiah
receive
him
if
they
reject
him
they
give
proof
of
him
by
their
rejection
the
jews
in
testing
if
he
were
god
have
shown
that
he
was
man
the
church
has
had
as
much
difficulty
in
showing
that
jesus
christ
was
man
against
those
who
denied
it
as
in
showing
that
he
was
god
and
the
probabilities
were
equally
great
of
a
god
humiliated
even
to
the
death
on
the
cross
a
messiah
triumphing
over
death
by
his
own
death

it
from
the

of

to
free
it
from
the
slavery
of
sin
which
visibly
reigns
in
man
to
give
laws
to
this
people
and
engrave
these
laws
on
their
heart
to
offer
himself
to

for
them
and
sacrifice
himself
for
them
to
be
a

without

what
preceded
and

all
the
jews
exist
still
and
are
wanderers
of
all
that
is
on
earth
he
partakes
only
of
the
sorrows
not
of
the
joys
he
loves
his
neighbours
but
his
love
does
not
confine
itself
within
these
bounds
and
overflows
to
his
own
enemies
and
then
to
those
of
god
jesus
christ
typified
by
joseph
the
beloved
of
his
father
sent
by
his
father
to
see
his
brethren
innocent
sold
by
his
brethren
for
twenty
pieces
of
silver
and
thereby
becoming
their
lord
their
saviour
the
saviour
of
strangers
and
the
saviour
of
the
world
which
had
not
been
but
for
their
plot
to
destroy
him
their
sale
and
their
rejection
of
him
in
prison
joseph
innocent
between
two
criminals
jesus
christ
on
the
cross
between
two
thieves
joseph
foretells
freedom
to
the
one
and
death
to
the
other
from
the
same
omens
jesus
christ
saves
the
elect
and
condemns
the
outcast
for
the
same
sins
joseph
foretells
only
jesus
christ
acts
joseph
asks
him
who
will
be
saved
to
remember
him
when
he
comes
into
his
glory
and
he
whom
jesus
christ
saves
asks
that
he
will
remember
him
when
he
comes
into
his
kingdom
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
was
only
reserved
for
the
grace
of
the
messiah
the
jews
have
been
so
long
in
opposition
to
them
without
success
all
that
solomon
and
the
prophets
said
has
been
useless
sages
like
plato
and
socrates
have
not
been
able
to
persuade
them
after
many
persons
had
gone
before
jesus
christ
at
last
came
to
say
here
am
i
and
this
is
the
time
that
which
the
prophets
have
said
was
to
come
in
the
fullness
of
time
i
tell
you
my
apostles
will
do
the
jews
shall
be
cast
out
jerusalem
shall
be
soon
destroyed
and
the
heathen
shall
enter
into
the
knowledge
of
god
my
apostles
shall
do
this
after
you
have
slain
the
heir
of
the
vineyard
then
the
apostles
said
to
the
jews
you
shall
be
accursed
laughed
at
and
to
the
heathen
you
shall
enter
into
the
knowledge
of
god
and
this
then
came
to
pass
jesus
christ
came
to
blind
those
who
saw
clearly
and
to
give
sight
to
the
blind
to
heal
the
sick
and
leave
the
healthy
to
die
to
call
to
repentance
and
to
justify
sinners
and
to
leave
the
righteous
in
their
sins
to
fill
the
needy
and
leave
the
rich
empty
spiritum
all
nations
were
in
unbelief
and
lust
the
whole
world
now
became
fervent
with
love
princes
abandoned
their
pomp
maidens
suffered
martyrdom
whence
came
this
influence
the
messiah
was
come
these
were
the
effect
and
sign
of
his
coming
destruction
of
the
jews
and
heathen
by
jesus
christ

in

we
must
say
taliter

isaiah
so
it
belongs
to
jesus
christ
to
be
universal
even
the
church
offers
sacrifice
only
for
the
faithful
jesus
christ
offered
that
of
the

for
all
there
is
heresy
in
always
explaining
by
all
and
heresy
in
not
explaining
it

by

are
heretics
in
explaining
it
by
all
quo
omnes
the

are

in
excepting
the
children
of
true
believers
we
must
then
follow
the
fathers
and
tradition
in
order
to
know
when
to
do
so
since
there
is
heresy
to
be
feared

saint
john
was
to
turn
the
hearts
of
the
fathers
to
the
children
and
jesus
christ
to
plant
division
there
is
not
contradiction
the
effects
and
the
err
in
saying
of
what
is
true
only
and
the
calvinists
in
saying
what
is
true
such
is
my
opinion
judæa

because
of
all
the
conditions
of
men
who
came
there
from
these
stones
there
come
children
unto

if
men
knew
themselves
god
would
heal
and
pardon
them
convertantur

jesus
christ
never
condemned
without
hearing
to
judas
ad
quid
venisti
to
him
that
had
not
on
the
wedding
garment
the
same
the
types
of
the
completeness
of
the
redemption
as
that
the
sun
gives
light
to
all
indicate
only
completeness
but
of
exclusions
as
of
the
jews
elected
to
the
exclusion
of
the
gentiles
indicate
exclusion
jesus
christ
the
redeemer
of
all
yes
for
he
has
offered
like
a
man
who
has
ransomed
all
those
who
were
willing
to
come
to
him
if
any
die
on
the
way
it
is
their
misfortune
but
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
offered
them
that
holds
good
in
this
example
where
he
who
ransoms
and
he
who
prevents
death
are
two
persons
but
not
of
jesus
christ
who
does
both
these
no
for
jesus
christ
in
the
quality
of
redeemer
is
not
perhaps
master
of
all
and
thus
in
so
far
as
it
is
in
him
he
is
the
redeemer
of
all
when
it
is
said
that
jesus
christ
did
not
die
for
all
you
take
undue
advantage
of
a
fault
in
men
who
at
once
apply
this
exception
to
themselves
and
this
is
to
favour
despair
instead
of
turning
them
from
it
to
favour
hope
for
men
thus
accustom
themselves
in
inward
virtues
by
outward
customs
the
victory
over
death
what
is
a
man
advantaged
if
he
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
whosoever
will
save
his
soul
shall
lose
it
i
am
not
come
to
destroy
the
law
but
to
fulfil
lambs
took
not
away
the
sins
of
the
world
but
i
am
the
lamb
which
taketh
away
the
sins
moses
hath
not
led
you
out
of
captivity
and
made
you
truly
free
then
jesus
christ
comes
to
tell
men
that
they
have
no
other
enemies
but
themselves
that
it
is
their
passions
which
keep
them
apart
from
god
that
he
comes
to
destroy
these
and
give
them
his
grace
so
as
to
make
of
them
all
one
holy
church
that
he
comes
to
bring
back
into
this
church
the
heathen
and
jews
that
he
comes
to
destroy
the
idols
of
the
former
and
the
superstition
of
the
latter
to
this
all
men
are
opposed
not
only
from
the
natural
opposition
of
lust
but
above
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
as
had
been
foretold
join
together
to
destroy
this
religion
at
its
birth
quare
fremuerunt
gentes
reges
terræ
adversus
all
that
is
great
on
earth
is
united
together
the
learned
the
wise
the
kings
the
first
write
the
second
condemn
the
last
kill
and
notwithstanding
all
these
oppositions
these
men
simple
and
weak
resist
all
these
powers
subdue
even
these
kings
these
learned
men
and
these
sages
and
remove
idolatry
from
all
the
earth
and
all
this
is
done
by
the
power
which
had
foretold
it
jesus
christ
would
not
have
the
testimony
of
devils
nor
of
those
who
were
not
called
but
of
god
and
john
the
baptist
i
consider
jesus
christ
in
all
persons
and
in
ourselves
jesus
christ
as
a
father
in
his
father
jesus
christ
as
a
brother
in
his
brethren
jesus
christ
as
poor
in
the
poor
jesus
christ
as
rich
in
the
rich
jesus
christ
as
doctor
and
priest
in
priests
jesus
christ
as
sovereign
in
princes
etc
for
by
his
glory
he
is
all
that
is
great
being
god
and
by
his
mortal
life
he
is
all
that
is
poor
and
abject
therefore
he
has
taken
this
unhappy
condition
so
that
he
could
be
in
all
persons
and
the
model
of
all
conditions
jesus
christ
is
an
obscurity
according
to
what
the
world
calls
obscurity
such
that
historians
writing
only
of
important
matters
of
states
have
hardly
noticed
him
the
fact
that
neither
josephus
nor
tacitus
nor
other
historians
have
spoken
of
jesus
so
far
is
this
from
telling
against
christianity
that
on
the
contrary
it
tells
for
it
for
it
is
certain
that
jesus
christ
has
existed
that
his
religion
has
made
a
great
talk
and
that
these
persons
were
not
ignorant
of
it
thus
it
is
plain
that
they
purposely
concealed
it
or
that
if
they
did
speak
of
it
their
account
has
been
suppressed
or
changed
i
have
reserved
me
seven
thousand
i
love
the
worshippers
unknown
to
the
world
and
to
the
very
prophets
as
jesus
christ
remained
unknown
among
men
so
his
truth
remains
among
common
opinions
without
external
difference
thus
the
eucharist
among
ordinary
bread
jesus
would
not
be
slain
without
the
forms
of
justice
for
it
is
far
more
ignominious
to
die
by
justice
than
by
an
unjust
sedition
the
false
justice
of
pilate
only
serves
to
make
jesus
christ
suffer
for
he
causes
him
to
be
scourged
by
his
false
justice
and
afterwards
puts
him
to
death
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
put
him
to
death
at
once
thus
it
is
with
the
falsely
just
they
do
good
and
evil
works
to
please
the
world
and
to
show
that
they
are
not
altogether
of
jesus
christ
for
they
are
ashamed
of
him
and
at
last
under
great
temptation
and
on
great
occasions
they
kill
him
what
man
ever
had
more
renown
the
whole
jewish
people
foretell
him
before
his
coming
the
gentile
people
worship
him
after
his
coming
the
two
peoples
gentile
and
jewish
regard
him
as
their
centre
and
yet
what
man
enjoys
this
renown
less
of
years
he
lives
thirty
without
appearing
for
three
years
he
passes
as
an
impostor
the
priests
and
the
chief
people
reject
him
his
friends
and
his
nearest
relatives
despise
him
finally
he
dies
betrayed
by
one
of
his
own
disciples
denied
by
another
and
abandoned
by
all
what
part
then
has
he
in
this
renown
never
had
man
so
much
renown
never
had
man
more
ignominy
all
that
renown
has
served
only
for
us
to
render
us
capable
of
recognising
him
and
he
had
none
of
it
for
himself
the
infinite
distance
between
body
and
mind
is
a
symbol
of
the
infinitely
more
infinite
distance
between
mind
and
charity
for
charity
is
supernatural
all
the
glory
of
greatness
has
no
lustre
for
people
who
are
in
search
of
understanding
the
greatness
of
clever
men
is
invisible
to
kings
to
the
rich
to
chiefs
and
to
all
the
worldly
great
the
greatness
of
wisdom
which
is
nothing
if
not
of
god
is
invisible
to
the
and
to
the
clever
these
are
three
orders
differing
in
kind
great
geniuses
have
their
power
their
glory
their
greatness
their
victory
their
lustre
and
have
no
need
of
worldly
greatness
with
which
they
are
not
in
keeping
they
are
seen
not
by
the
eye
but
by
the
mind
this
is
sufficient
the
saints
have
their
power
their
glory
their
victory
their
lustre
and
need
no
worldly
or
intellectual
greatness
with
which
they
have
no
affinity
for
these
neither
add
anything
to
them
nor
take
away
anything
from
them
they
are
seen
of
god
and
the
angels
and
not
of
the
body
nor
of
the
curious
mind
god
is
enough
for
them
archimedes
apart
from
his
rank
would
have
the
same
veneration
he
fought
no
battles
for
the
eyes
to
feast
upon
but
he
has
given
his
discoveries
to
all
men
oh
how
brilliant
he
was
to
the
mind
jesus
christ
without
riches
and
without
any
external
exhibition
of
knowledge
is
in
his
own
order
of
holiness
he
did
not
invent
he
did
not
reign
but
he
was
humble
patient
holy
holy
to
god
terrible
to
devils
without
any
sin
oh
in
what
great
pomp
and
in
what
wonderful
splendour
he
is
come
to
the
eyes
of
the
heart
which
perceive
wisdom
it
would
have
been
useless
for
archimedes
to
have
acted
the
prince
in
his
books
on
geometry
although
he
was
a
prince
it
would
have
been
useless
for
our
lord
jesus
christ
to
come
like
a
king
in
order
to
shine
forth
in
his
kingdom
of
holiness
but
he
came
there
appropriately
in
the
glory
of
his
own
order
it
is
most
absurd
to
take
offence
at
the
lowliness
of
jesus
christ
as
if
his
lowliness
were
in
the
same
order
as
the
greatness
which
he
came
to
manifest
if
we
consider
this
greatness
in
his
life
in
his
passion
in
his
obscurity
in
his
death
in
the
choice
of
his
disciples
in
their
desertion
in
his
secret
resurrection
and
the
rest
we
shall
see
it
to
be
so
immense
that
we
shall
have
no
reason
for
being
offended
at
a
lowliness
which
is
not
of
that
order
but
there
are
some
who
can
only
admire
worldly
greatness
as
though
there
were
no
intellectual
greatness
and
others
who
only
admire
intellectual
greatness
as
though
there
were
not
infinitely
higher
things
in
wisdom
all
bodies
the
firmament
the
stars
the
earth
and
its
kingdoms
are
not
equal
to
the
lowest
mind
for
mind
knows
all
these
and
itself
and
these
bodies
nothing
all
bodies
together
and
all
minds
together
and
all
their
products
are
not
equal
to
the
least
feeling
of
charity
this
is
of
an
order
infinitely
more
exalted
from
all
bodies
together
we
can
not
obtain
one
little
thought
this
is
impossible
and
of
another
order
from
all
bodies
and
minds
we
can
not
produce
a
feeling
of
true
charity
this
is
impossible
and
of
another
and
supernatural
order
why
did
jesus
christ
not
come
in
a
visible
manner
instead
of
obtaining
testimony
of
himself
from
preceding
prophecies
why
did
he
cause
himself
to
be
foretold
in
types
if
jesus
christ
had
only
come
to
sanctify
all
scripture
and
all
things
would
tend
to
that
end
and
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
convince
unbelievers
if
jesus
christ
had
only
come
to
blind
all
his
conduct
would
be
confused
and
we
would
have
no
means
of
convincing
unbelievers
but
as
he
came
sanctificationem
et
in
as
isaiah
says
we
can
not
convince
unbelievers
and
they
can
not
convince
us
but
by
this
very
fact
we
convince
them
since
we
say
that
in
his
whole
conduct
there
is
no
convincing
proof
on
one
side
or
the
other
jesus
christ
does
not
say
that
he
is
not
of
nazareth
in
order
to
leave
the
wicked
in
their
blindness
nor
that
he
is
not
joseph
son
of
jesus
jesus
christ
said
great
things
so
simply
that
it
seems
as
though
he
had
not
thought
them
great
and
yet
so
clearly
that
we
easily
see
what
he
thought
of
them
this
clearness
joined
to
this
simplicity
is
wonderful
the
style
of
the
gospel
is
admirable
in
so
many
ways
and
among
the
rest
in
hurling
no
invectives
against
the
persecutors
and
enemies
of
jesus
christ
for
there
is
no
such
invective
in
any
of
the
historians
against
judas
pilate
or
any
of
the
jews
if
this
moderation
of
the
writers
of
the
gospels
had
been
assumed
as
well
as
many
other
traits
of
so
beautiful
a
character
and
they
had
only
assumed
it
to
attract
notice
even
if
they
had
not
dared
to
draw
attention
to
it
themselves
they
would
not
have
failed
to
secure
friends
who
would
have
made
such
remarks
to
their
advantage
but
as
they
acted
thus
without
pretence
and
from
wholly
disinterested
motives
they
did
not
point
it
out
to
any
one
and
i
believe
that
many
such
facts
have
not
been
noticed
till
now
which
is
evidence
of
the
natural
disinterestedness
with
which
the
thing
has
been
done
an
artisan
who
speaks
of
wealth
a
lawyer
who
speaks
of
war
of
royalty
etc
but
the
rich
man
rightly
speaks
of
wealth
a
king
speaks
indifferently
of
a
great
gift
he
has
just
made
and
god
rightly
speaks
of
god
who
has
taught
the
evangelists
the
qualities
of
a
perfectly
heroic
soul
that
they
paint
it
so
perfectly
in
jesus
christ
why
do
they
make
him
weak
in
his
agony
do
they
not
know
how
to
paint
a
resolute
death
yes
for
the
same
saint
luke
paints
the
death
of
saint
stephen
as
braver
than
that
of
jesus
christ
they
make
him
therefore
capable
of
fear
before
the
necessity
of
dying
has
come
and
then
altogether
brave
but
when
they
make
him
so
troubled
it
is
when
he
afflicts
himself
and
when
men
afflict
him
he
is
altogether
strong
of
jesus
the
supposition
that
the
apostles
were
impostors
is
very
absurd
let
us
think
it
out
let
us
imagine
those
twelve
men
assembled
after
the
death
of
jesus
christ
plotting
to
say
that
he
was
risen
by
this
they
attack
all
the
powers
the
heart
of
man
is
strangely
inclined
to
fickleness
to
change
to
promises
to
gain
however
little
any
of
them
might
have
been
led
astray
by
all
these
attractions
nay
more
by
the
fear
of
prisons
tortures
and
death
they
were
lost
let
us
follow
up
this
thought
the
apostles
were
either
deceived
or
deceivers
either
supposition
has
difficulties
for
it
is
not
possible
to
mistake
a
man
raised
from
the
dead
while
jesus
christ
was
with
them
he
could
sustain
them
but
after
that
if
he
did
not
appear
to
them
who
inspired
them
to
act
section
xiii
the
miracles
miracles
enable
us
to
judge
of
doctrine
and
doctrine
enables
us
to
judge
of
miracles
there
are
false
miracles
and
true
there
must
be
a
distinction
in
order
to
know
them
otherwise
they
would
be
useless
now
they
are
not
useless
on
the
contrary
they
are
fundamental
now
the
rule
which
is
given
to
us
must
be
such
that
it
does
not
destroy
the
proof
which
the
true
miracles
give
of
the
truth
which
is
the
chief
end
of
the
miracles
moses
has
given
two
rules
that
the
prediction
does
not
come
to
pass
deut
xviii
and
that
they
do
not
lead
to
idolatry
deut
xiii
and
jesus
christ
one
if
doctrine
regulates
miracles
miracles
are
useless
for
doctrine
if
miracles
regulate
to
the
the
distinction
of
the
times
one
rule
during
the
time
of
moses
another
at
present
it
is
an
effect
which
exceeds
the
natural
power
of
the
means
which
are
employed
for
it
and
what
is
not
a
miracle
is
an
effect
which
does
not
exceed
the
natural
power
of
the
means
which
are
employed
for
it
thus
those
who
heal
by
invocation
of
the
devil
do
not
work
a
miracle
for
that
does
not
exceed
the
natural
power
of
the
devil
but
the
two
fundamentals
one
inward
the
other
outward
grace
and
miracles
both
supernatural
miracles
and
truth
are
necessary
because
it
is
necessary
to
convince
the
entire
man
in
body
and
soul
in
all
times
either
men
have
spoken
of
the
true
god
or
the
true
god
has
spoken
to
men
jesus
christ
has
verified
that
he
was
the
messiah
never
in
verifying
his
doctrine
by
scripture
and
the
prophecies
but
always
by
his
miracles
he
proves
by
a
miracle
that
he
remits
sins
rejoice
not
in
your
miracles
said
jesus
christ
but
because
your
names
are
written
in
heaven
if
they
believe
not
moses
neither
will
they
believe
one
risen
from
the
dead
nicodemus
recognises
by
his
miracles
that
his
teaching
is
of
god
quia
venisti
a
deo
magister
nemo
enim
potest
hæc
signa
facere
quæ
tu
facis
nisi
deus
fuerit
cum
he
does
not
judge
of
the
miracles
by
the
teaching
but
of
the
teaching
by
the
miracles
the
jews
had
a
doctrine
of
god
as
we
have
one
of
jesus
christ
and
confirmed
by
miracles
they
were
forbidden
to
believe
every
worker
of
miracles
and
they
were
further
commanded
to
have
recourse
to
the
chief
priests
and
to
rely
on
them
and
thus
in
regard
to
their
prophets
they
had
all
those
reasons
which
we
have
for
refusing
to
believe
the
workers
of
miracles
and
yet
they
were
very
sinful
in
rejecting
the
prophets
and
jesus
christ
because
of
their
miracles
and
they
would
not
have
been
culpable
if
they
had
not
seen
the
miracles
fecissem
peccatum
non
therefore
all
belief
rests
upon
miracles
prophecy
is
not
called
miracle
as
saint
john
speaks
of
the
first
miracle
in
cana
and
then
of
what
jesus
christ
says
to
the
woman
of
samaria
when
he
reveals
to
her
all
her
hidden
life
then
he
heals
the
centurion
son
and
saint
john
calls
this
the
second
miracle
the
combinations
of
miracles
the
second
miracle
can
suppose
the
first
but
the
first
can
not
suppose
the
second
had
it
not
been
for
the
miracles
there
would
have
been
no
sin
in
not
believing
in
jesus
christ
i
should
not
be
a
christian
but
for
the
miracles
said
saint
augustine
how
i
hate
those
who
make
men
doubt
of
miracles
montaigne
speaks
of
them
as
he
should
in
two
places
in
one
we
see
how
careful
he
is
and
yet
in
the
other
he
believes
and
makes
sport
of
unbelievers
however
it
may
be
the
church
is
without
proofs
if
they
are
right
montaigne
against
miracles
montaigne
for
miracles
it
is
not
possible
to
have
a
reasonable
belief
against
miracles
unbelievers
the
most
credulous
they
believe
the
miracles
of
vespasian
in
order
not
to
believe
those
of
moses
how
it
happens
that
men
believe
so
many
liars
who
say
that
they
have
seen
miracles
and
do
not
believe
any
of
those
who
say
that
they
have
secrets
to
make
men
immortal
or
restore
youth
to
having
considered
how
it
happens
that
so
great
credence
is
given
to
so
many
impostors
who
say
they
have
remedies
often
to
the
length
of
men
putting
their
lives
into
their
hands
it
has
appeared
to
me
that
the
true
cause
is
that
there
are
true
remedies
for
it
would
not
be
possible
that
there
should
be
so
many
false
remedies
and
that
so
much
faith
should
be
placed
in
them
if
there
were
none
true
if
there
had
never
been
any
remedy
for
any
ill
and
all
ills
had
been
incurable
it
is
impossible
that
men
should
have
imagined
that
they
could
give
remedies
and
still
more
impossible
that
so
many
others
should
have
believed
those
who
boasted
of
having
remedies
in
the
same
way
as
did
a
man
boast
of
preventing
death
no
one
would
believe
him
because
there
is
no
example
of
this
but
as
there
were
a
number
of
remedies
found
to
be
true
by
the
very
knowledge
of
the
greatest
men
the
belief
of
men
is
thereby
induced
and
this
being
known
to
be
possible
it
has
been
therefore
concluded
that
it
was
for
people
commonly
reason
thus
a
thing
is
possible
therefore
it
is
because
the
thing
can
not
be
denied
generally
since
there
are
particular
effects
which
are
true
the
people
who
can
not
distinguish
which
among
these
particular
effects
are
true
believe
them
all
in
the
same
way
the
reason
why
so
many
false
effects
are
credited
to
the
moon
is
that
there
are
some
true
as
the
tide
it
is
the
same
with
prophecies
miracles
divination
by
dreams
sorceries
etc
for
if
there
had
been
nothing
true
in
all
this
men
would
have
believed
nothing
of
them
and
thus
instead
of
concluding
that
there
are
no
true
miracles
because
there
are
so
many
false
we
must
on
the
contrary
say
that
there
certainly
are
true
miracles
since
there
are
false
and
that
there
are
false
miracles
only
because
some
are
true
we
must
reason
in
the
same
way
about
religion
for
it
would
not
be
possible
that
men
should
have
imagined
so
many
false
religions
if
there
had
not
been
a
true
one
the
objection
to
this
is
that
savages
have
a
religion
but
the
answer
is
that
they
have
heard
the
true
spoken
of
as
appears
by
the
deluge
circumcision
the
cross
of
saint
andrew
etc
having
considered
how
it
comes
that
there
are
so
many
false
miracles
false
revelations
sorceries
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
the
true
cause
is
that
there
are
some
true
for
it
would
not
be
possible
that
there
should
be
so
many
false
miracles
if
there
were
none
true
nor
so
many
false
revelations
if
there
were
none
true
nor
so
many
false
religions
if
there
were
not
one
true
for
if
there
had
never
been
all
this
it
is
almost
impossible
that
men
should
have
imagined
it
and
still
more
impossible
that
so
many
others
should
have
believed
it
but
as
there
have
been
very
great
things
true
and
as
they
have
been
believed
by
great
men
this
impression
has
been
the
cause
that
nearly
everybody
is
rendered
capable
of
believing
also
the
false
and
thus
instead
of
concluding
that
there
are
no
true
miracles
since
there
are
so
many
false
it
must
be
said
on
the
contrary
that
there
are
true
miracles
since
there
are
so
many
false
and
that
there
are
false
ones
only
because
there
are
true
and
that
in
the
same
way
there
are
false
religions
because
there
is
one
objection
to
this
savages
have
a
religion
but
this
is
because
they
have
heard
the
true
spoken
of
as
appears
by
the
cross
of
saint
andrew
the
deluge
circumcision
this
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
human
mind
finding
itself
inclined
to
that
side
by
the
truth
becomes
thereby
susceptible
of
all
the
falsehoods
of
this

jesus

that

and
his
will

the
devil
favoured
the
doctrine
which
destroys
him
he
would
be
divided
against

as
jesus
christ
said
if
god
favoured
the
doctrine
which
destroys
the
church
he
would
be
divided
against
himself
regnum
for
jesus
christ
wrought
against
the
devil
and
destroyed
his
power
over
the
heart
of
which
exorcism
is
the
symbolisation
in
order
to
establish
the
kingdom
of
god
and
thus
he
adds
in
digito
dei
regnum
dei
ad
there
is
a
great
difference
between
tempting
and
leading
into
error
god
tempts
but
he
does
not
lead
into
error
to
tempt
is
to
afford
opportunities
which
impose
no
necessity
if
men
do
not
love
god
they
will
do
a
certain
thing
to
lead
into
error
is
to
place
a
man
under
the
necessity
of
inferring
and
following
out
what
is
untrue
abraham
and
gideon
are
above
revelation
the
jews
blinded
themselves
in
judging
of
miracles
by
the
scripture
god
has
never
abandoned
his
true
worshippers
i
prefer
to
follow
jesus
christ
than
any
other
because
he
has
miracle
prophecy
doctrine
perpetuity
etc
the
donatists
no
miracle
which
obliges
them
to
say
it
is
the
devil
the
more
we
particularise
god
jesus
christ
the
church
if
there
were
no
false
miracles
there
would
be
certainty
if
there
were
no
rule
to
judge
of
them
miracles
would
be
useless
and
there
would
be
no
reason
for
believing
now
there
is
humanly
speaking
no
human
certainty
but
we
have
reason
either
god
has
confounded
the
false
miracles
or
he
has
foretold
them
and
in
both
ways
he
has
raised
himself
above
what
is
supernatural
with
respect
to
us
and
has
raised
us
to
it
miracles
serve
not
to
convert
but
to
condemn
q
a
why
we
do

foundation
of
religion
it
is
the
miracles
what
then
does
god
speak
against
miracles
against
the
foundations
of
the
faith
which
we
have
in
him
if
there
is
a
god
faith
in
god
must
exist
on
earth
now
the
miracles
of
jesus
christ
are
not
foretold
by
antichrist
but
the
miracles
of
antichrist
are
foretold
by
jesus
christ
and
so
if
jesus
christ
were
not
the
messiah
he
would
have
indeed
led
into
error
when
jesus
christ
foretold
the
miracles
of
antichrist
did
he
think
of
destroying
faith
in
his
own
miracles
moses
foretold
jesus
christ
and
bade
to
follow
him
jesus
christ
foretold
antichrist
and
forbade
to
follow
him
it
was
impossible
that
in
the
time
of
moses
men
should
keep
their
faith
for
antichrist
who
was
unknown
to
them
but
it
is
quite
easy
in
the
time
of
antichrist
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
already
known
there
is
no
reason
for
believing
in
antichrist
which
there
is
not
for
believing
in
jesus
christ
but
there
are
reasons
for
believing
in
jesus
christ
which
there
are
not
for
believing
in
the
other
judges

says
that

testify
of
him
but
he
does
not
point
out
in
what
respect
even
the
prophecies
could
not
prove
jesus
christ
during
his
life
and
so
men
would
not
have
been
culpable
for
not
believing
in
him
before
his
death
had
the
miracles
not
sufficed
without
doctrine
now
those
who
did
not
believe
in
him
when
he
was
still
alive
were
sinners
as
he
said
himself
and
without
excuse
therefore
they
must
have
had
proof
beyond
doubt
which
they
resisted
now
they
had
not
the
prophecies
but
only
the
miracles
therefore
the
latter
suffice
when
the
doctrine
is
not
inconsistent
with
them
and
they
ought
to
be
believed
john
vii
among
the
jews
as
among
the
christians
of
some
believed
in
jesus
christ
others
believed
him
not
because
of
the
prophecies
which
said
that
he
should
be
born
in
bethlehem
they
should
have
considered
more
carefully
whether
he
was
not
for
his
miracles
being
convincing
they
should
have
been
quite
sure
of
these
supposed
contradictions
of
his
teaching
to
scripture
and
this
obscurity
did
not
excuse
but
blinded
them
thus
those
who
refuse
to
believe
in
the
miracles
in
the
present
day
on
account
of
a
supposed
contradiction
which
is
unreal
are
not
excused
the
pharisees
said
to
the
people
who
believed
in
him
because
of
his
miracles
this
people
who
knoweth
not
the
law
are
cursed
but
have
any
of
the
rulers
or
of
the
pharisees
believed
on
him
for
we
know
that
out
of
galilee
ariseth
no
prophet
nicodemus
answered
doth
our
law
judge
any
man
before
it
hear
him
and
specially
such
a
man
who
works
such
miracles
the
prophecies
were
ambiguous
they
are
no
longer
so
the
five
propositions
were
ambiguous
they
are
no
longer
so
miracles
are
no
longer
necessary
because
we
have
had
them
already
but
when
tradition
is
no
longer
minded
when
the
pope
alone
is
offered
to
us
when
he
has
been
imposed
upon
and
when
the
true
source
of
truth
which
is
tradition
is
thus
excluded
and
the
pope
who
is
its
guardian
is
biased
the
truth
is
no
longer
free
to
appear
then
as
men
speak
no
longer
of
truth
truth
itself
must
speak
to
men
this
is
what
happened
in
the
time
of
arius
miracles
under
diocletian
and
under
arius
the
people
concluded
this
of
themselves
but
if
the
reason
of
it
must
be
given
to
you
it
is
unfortunate
to
be
in
exception
to
the
rule
the
same
must
be
strict
and
opposed
to
exception
but
yet
as
it
is
certain
that
there
are
exceptions
to
a
rule
our
judgment
must
though
strict
be
just
john
vi
quia
vidisti
signum
sed
quia
saturati
those
who
follow
jesus
christ
because
of
his
miracles
honour
his
power
in
all
the
miracles
which
it
produces
but
those
who
making
profession
to
follow
him
because
of
his
miracles
follow
him
in
fact
only
because
he
comforts
them
and
satisfies
them
with
worldly
blessings
discredit
his
miracles
when
they
are
opposed
to
their
own
comforts
john
ix
est
hic
homo
a
deo
quia
sabbatum
non
custodit
alii
quomodo
potest
homo
peccator
hæc
signa
facere
which
is
the
most
clear
this
house
is
not
of
god
for
they
do
not
there
believe
that
the
five
propositions
are
in
jansenius
others
this
house
is
of
god
for
in
it
there
are
wrought
strange
miracles
which
is
the
most
clear
quid
dicis
dico
quia
propheta
est
nisi
esset
hic
a
deo
non
poterat
facere
in
the
old
testament
when
they
will
turn
you
from
god
in
the
new
when
they
will
turn
you
from
jesus
christ
these
are
the
occasions
for
excluding
particular
miracles
from
belief
no
others
need
be
excluded
does
it
therefore
follow
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
exclude
all
the
prophets
who
came
to
them
no
they
would
have
sinned
in
not
excluding
those
who
denied
god
and
would
have
sinned
in
excluding
those
who
did
not
deny
god
so
soon
then
as
we
see
a
miracle
we
must
either
assent
to
it
or
have
striking
proofs
to
the
contrary
we
must
see
if
it
denies
a
god
or
jesus
christ
or
the
church
there
is
a
great
difference
between
not
being
for
jesus
christ
and
saying
so
and
not
being
for
jesus
christ
and
pretending
to
be
so
the
one
party
can
do
miracles
not
the
others
for
it
is
clear
of
the
one
party
that
they
are
opposed
to
the
truth
but
not
of
the
others
and
thus
miracles
are
clearer
that
we
must
love
one
god
only
is
a
thing
so
evident
that
it
does
not
require
miracles
to
prove
it
jesus
christ
performed
miracles
then
the
apostles
and
the
first
saints
in
great
number
because
the
prophecies
not
being
yet
accomplished
but
in
the
process
of
being
accomplished
by
them
the
miracles
alone
bore
witness
to
them
it
was
foretold
that
the
messiah
should
convert
the
nations
how
could
this
prophecy
be
fulfilled
without
the
conversion
of
the
nations
and
how
could
the
nations
be
converted
to
the
messiah
if
they
did
not
see
this
final
effect
of
the
prophecies
which
prove
him
therefore
till
he
had
died
risen
again
and
converted
the
nations
all
was
not
accomplished
and
so
miracles
were
needed
during
all
this
time
now
they
are
no
longer
needed
against
the
jews
for
the
accomplished
prophecies
constitute
a
lasting
miracle
though
ye
believe
not
me
believe
at
least
the
works
he
refers
them
as
it
were
to
the
strongest
proof
it
had
been
told
to
the
jews
as
well
as
to
christians
that
they
should
not
always
believe
the
prophets
but
yet
the
pharisees
and
scribes
are
greatly
concerned
about
his
miracles
and
try
to
show
that
they
are
false
or
wrought
by
the
devil
for
they
must
needs
be
convinced
if
they
acknowledge
that
they
are
of
god
at
the
present
day
we
are
not
troubled
to
make
this
distinction
still
it
is
very
easy
to
do
those
who
deny
neither
god
nor
jesus
christ
do
no
miracles
which
are
not
certain
facit
virtutem
in
nomine
meo
et
cito
possit
de
me
male
but
we
have
not
to
draw
this
distinction
here
is
a
sacred
relic
here
is
a
thorn
from
the
crown
of
the
saviour
of
the
world
over
whom
the
prince
of
this
world
has
no
power
which
works
miracles
by
the
peculiar
power
of
the
blood
shed
for
us
now
god
himself
chooses
this
house
in
order
to
display
conspiciously
therein
his
power
these
are
not
men
who
do
miracles
by
an
unknown
and
doubtful
virtue
which
makes
a
decision
difficult
for
us
it
is
god
himself
it
is
the
instrument
of
the
passion
of
his
only
son
who
being
in
many
places
chooses
this
and
makes
men
come
from
all
quarters
there
to
receive
these
miraculous
alleviations
in
their
weaknesses
the
church
has
three
kinds
of
enemies
the
jews
who
have
never
been
of
her
body
the
heretics
who
have
withdrawn
from
it
and
the
evil
christians
who
rend
her
from
within
these
three
kinds
of
different
adversaries
usually
attack
her
in
different
ways
but
here
they
attack
her
in
one
and
the
same
way
as
they
are
all
without
miracles
and
as
the
church
has
always
had
miracles
against
them
they
have
all
had
the
same
interest
in
evading
them
and
they
all
make
use
of
this
excuse
that
doctrine
must
not
be
judged
by
miracles
but
miracles
by
doctrine
there
were
two
parties
among
those
who
heard
jesus
christ
those
who
followed
his
teaching
on
account
of
his
miracles
others
who
said
there
were
two
parties
in
the
time
of
calvin
there
are
now
the
jesuits
etc
miracles
furnish
the
test
in
matters
of
doubt
between
jews
and
heathens
jews
and
christians
catholics
and
heretics
the
slandered
and
slanderers
between
the
two
crosses
but
miracles
would
be
useless
to
heretics
for
the
church
authorised
by
miracles
which
have
already
obtained
belief
tells
us
that
they
have
not
the
true
faith
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
are
not
in
it
since
the
first
miracles
of
the
church
exclude
belief
of
theirs
thus
there
is
miracle
against
miracle
both
the
first
and
greatest
being
on
the
side
of
the
church
these
nuns
astonished
at
what
is
said
that
they
are
in
the
way
of
perdition
that
their
confessors
are
leading
them
to
geneva
that
they
suggest
to
them
that
jesus
christ
is
not
in
the
eucharist
nor
on
the
right
hand
of
the
father
know
that
all
this
is
false
and
therefore
offer
themselves
to
god
in
this
state
si
via
iniquitatis
in
me
what
happens
thereupon
this
place
which
is
said
to
be
the
temple
of
the
devil
god
makes
his
own
temple
it
is
said
that
the
children
must
be
taken
away
from
it
god
heals
them
there
it
is
said
that
it
is
the
arsenal
of
hell
god
makes
of
it
the
sanctuary
of
his
grace
lastly
they
are
threatened
with
all
the
fury
and
vengeance
of
heaven
and
god
overwhelms
them
with
favours
a
man
would
need
to
have
lost
his
senses
to
conclude
from
this
that
they
are
therefore
in
the
way
of
perdition
we
have
without
doubt
the
same
signs
as
saint
athanasius

amongst

covered

with
a

which
leaves
her
unrecognised
by
those
who
do
not
hear
her
voice
room
is
opened
for
blasphemy
even
against
the
truths
that
are
at
least
very
likely
if
the
truths
of
the
gospel
are
published
the
contrary
is
published
too
and
the
questions
are
obscured
so
that
the
people
can
not
distinguish
and
they
ask
what
have
you
to
make
you
believed
rather
than
others
what
sign
do
you
give
you
have
only
words
and
so
have
we
if
you
had
miracles
good
and
well
that
doctrine
ought
to
be
supported
by
miracles
is
a
truth
which
they
misuse
in
order
to
revile
doctrine
and
if
miracles
happen
it
is
said
that
miracles
are
not
enough
without
doctrine
and
this
is
another
truth
which
they
misuse
in
order
to
revile
miracles
jesus
christ
cured
the
man
born
blind
and
performed
a
number
of
miracles
on
the
sabbath
day
in
this
way
he
blinded
the
pharisees
who
said
that
miracles
must
be
judged
by
doctrine
we
have
moses
but
as
for
this
fellow
we
know
not
from
whence
he
is
it
is
wonderful
that
you
know
not
whence
he
is
and
yet
he
does
such
miracles
jesus
christ
spoke
neither
against
god
nor
against
moses
antichrist
and
the
false
prophets
foretold
by
both
testaments
will
speak
openly
against
god
and
against
jesus
christ
who
is
not
hidden
god
would
not
allow
him
who
would
be
a
secret
enemy
to
do
miracles
openly
in
a
public
dispute
where
the
two
parties
profess
to
be
for
god
for
jesus
christ
for
the
church
miracles
have
never
been
on
the
side
of
the
false
christians
and
the
other
side
has
never
been
without
a
miracle
he
hath
a
devil
john
x
and
others
said
can
a
devil
open
the
eyes
of
the
blind
the
proofs
which
jesus
christ
and
the
apostles
draw
from
scripture
are
not
conclusive
for
they
say
only
that
moses
foretold
that
a
prophet
should
come
but
they
do
not
thereby
prove
that
this
is
he
and
that
is
the
whole
question
these
passages
therefore
serve
only
to
show
that
they
are
not
contrary
to
scripture
and
that
there
appears
no
inconsistency
but
not
that
there
is
agreement
now
this
is
enough
namely
exclusion
of
inconsistency
along
with
miracles
there
is
a
mutual
duty
between
god
and
men
we
must
pardon
him
this
saying
quid
debui
accuse
me
said
god
in
isaiah
god
must
fulfil
his
promises
etc
men
owe
it
to
god
to
accept
the
religion
which
he
sends
god
owes
it
to
men
not
to
lead
them
into
error
now
they
would
be
led
into
error
if
the
workers
of
miracles
announced
a
doctrine
which
should
not
appear
evidently
false
to
the
light
of
common
sense
and
if
a
greater
worker
of
miracles
had
not
already
warned
men
not
to
believe
them
thus
if
there
were
divisions
in
the
church
and
the
arians
for
example
who
declared
themselves
founded
on
scripture
just
as
the
catholics
had
done
miracles
and
not
the
catholics
men
should
have
been
led
into
error
for
as
a
man
who
announces
to
us
the
secrets
of
god
is
not
worthy
to
be
believed
on
his
private
authority
and
that
is
why
the
ungodly
doubt
him
so
when
a
man
as
a
token
of
the
communion
which
he
has
with
god
raises
the
dead
foretells
the
future
removes
the
seas
heals
the
sick
there
is
none
so
wicked
as
not
to
bow
to
him
and
the
incredulity
of
pharaoh
and
the
pharisees
is
the
effect
of
a
supernatural
obduracy

therefore
we
see
miracles
and
a
doctrine
not
suspicious
both
on
one
side
there
is
no
difficulty
but
when
we
see
miracles
and
suspicious
doctrine
on
the
same
side
we
must
then
see
which
is
the
clearest
jesus
christ
was
suspected
blinded
the
power
of
god
surpasses
that
of
his
enemies
the
jewish
exorcists
beaten
by
the
devils
saying
jesus
i
know
and
paul
i
know
but
who
are
ye
miracles
are
for
doctrine
and
not
doctrine
for
miracles
if
the
miracles
are
true
shall
we
be
able
to
persuade
men
of
all
doctrine
no
for
this
will
not
come
to
pass
rule
we
must
judge
of

by
miracles
we
must
judge
of
miracles
by
doctrine
all
this
is
true
but
contains
no
contradiction
for
we
must
distinguish
the
times
how
glad
you
are
to
know
the
general
rules
thinking
thereby
to
set
up
dissension
and
render
all
useless
we
shall
prevent
you
my
father
truth
is
one
and
constant
it
is
impossible
from
the
duty
of
god
to
men
that
a
man
hiding
his
evil
teaching
and
only
showing
the
good
saying
that
he
conforms
to
god
and
the
church
should
do
miracles
so
as
to
instil
insensibly
a
false
and
subtle
doctrine
this
can
not
happen
and
still
less
that
god
who
knows
the
heart
should
perform
miracles
in
favour
of
such
a
one
the
three
marks
of
religion
perpetuity
a
good
life
miracles
they
destroy
perpetuity
by
their
doctrine
of
probability
a
good
life
by
their
morals
miracles
by
destroying
either
their
truth
or
the
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
them
if
we
believe
them
the
church
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
perpetuity
holiness
and
miracles
the
heretics
deny
them
or
deny
the
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
them
they
do
the
same
but
one
would
need
to
have
no
sincerity
in
order
to
deny
them
or
again
to
lose
one
senses
in
order
to
deny
the
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
them
nobody
has
ever
suffered
martyrdom
for
the
miracles
which
he
says
he
has
seen
for
the
folly
of
men
goes
perhaps
to
the
length
of
martyrdom
for
those
which
the
turks
believe
by
tradition
but
not
for
those
which
they
have
seen
the
heretics
have
always
attacked
these
three
marks
which
they
have
not
an
angel
from
heaven
we
must
not
judge
of
truth
by
miracles
but
of
miracles
by
truth
therefore
the
miracles
are
useless
now
they
are
of
use
and
they
must
not
be
in
opposition
to
the
truth
therefore
what
father
lingende
has
said
that
god
will
not
permit
that
a
miracle
may
lead
into
error
when
there
shall
be
a
controversy
in
the
same
church
miracle
will
decide
but
antichrist
will
do
miracles
the
magicians
of
pharaoh
did
not
entice
to
error
thus
we
can
not
say
to
jesus
respecting
antichrist
you
have
led
me
into
error
for
antichrist
will
do
them
against
jesus
christ
and
so
they
can
not
lead
into
error
either
god
will
not
permit
false
miracles
or
he
will
procure
greater
jesus
christ
has
existed
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
this
is
more
impressive
than
all
the
miracles
of
antichrist
if
in
the
same
church
there
should
happen
a
miracle
on
the
side
of
those
in
error
men
would
be
led
into
error
schism
is
visible
a
miracle
is
visible
but
schism
is
more
a
sign
of
error
than
a
miracle
is
a
sign
of
truth
therefore
a
miracle
can
not
lead
into
error
but
apart
from
schism
error
is
not
so
obvious
as
a
miracle
is
obvious
therefore
a
miracle
could
lead
into
error

the

that

depends
upon
god
they
are
heretics
if
they
say
that
they
are
obedient
to
the

that
is
hypocrisy
if
they
are
ready
to
subscribe
to
all
the
articles
that
is
not
enough
if
they
say
that
a
man
must
not

killed
for

they
attack
the
morality
of
catholics
if
miracles
are
done
among
them
it
is
not
a
sign
of
holiness
and
is
on
the
contrary
a
symptom
of
heresy
this
way
in
which
the
church
has
existed
is
that
truth
has
been
without
dispute
or
if
it
has
been
contested
there
has
been
the
pope
or
failing
him
there
has
been
the
church
the
five
propositions
condemned
but
no
miracle
for
the
truth
was
not
attacked
but
the
sorbonne
but
the
bull
it
is
impossible
that
those
who
love
god
with
all
their
heart
should
fail
to
recognise
the
church
so
evident
is
it
is
impossible
that
those
who
do
not
love
god
should
be
convinced
of
the
church
miracles
have
such
influence
that
it
was
necessary
that
god
should
warn
men
not
to
believe
in
them
in
opposition
to
him
all
clear
as
it
is
that
there
is
a
god
without
this
they
would
have
been
able
to
disturb
men
and
thus
so
far
from
these
passages
deut
xiii
making
against
the
authority
of
the
miracles
nothing
more
indicates
their
influence
and
the

in

it
were

does
he
continually
speak

but
of
his

what
says
jesus

does
he
speak
of
the
evidence
of
the

no
his

had
not
fulfilled

but
he
says

which
had
been
treated
with
love
as
a
type
of
the
church
and
with
hatred
because
it
was
only
the
type
has
been
restored
being
on
the
point
of
falling
when
it
was
well
with
god
and
thus
a
type
miracles
prove
the
power
which
god
has
over
hearts
by
that
which
he
exercises
over
bodies
the
church
has
never
approved
a
miracle
among
heretics
miracles
a
support
of
religion
they
have
been
the
test
of
jews
they
have
been
the
test
of
christians
saints
innocents
and
true
believers
a
miracle
among
schismatics
is
not
so
much
to
be
feared
for
schism
which
is
more
obvious
than
a
miracle
visibly
indicates
their
error
but
when
there
is
no
schism
and
error
is
in
question
miracle
decides
non

wretches
who
have
obliged
us
to
speak

and

confirm

by
miracles
judith
god
speaks
at
last
in
their
greatest
oppression
if
the
cooling
of
love
leaves
the
church
almost
without
believers
miracles
will
rouse
them
this
is
one
of
the
last
effects
of
grace
if
one
miracle
were
wrought
among
the
jesuits
when
a
miracle
disappoints
the
expectation
of
those
in
whose
presence
it
happens
and
there
is
a
disproportion
between
the
state
of
their
faith
and
the
instrument
of
the
miracle
it
ought
then
to
induce
them
to
change
but
with
you
it
is
otherwise
there
would
be
as
much
reason
in
saying
that
if
the
eucharist
raised
a
dead
man
it
would
be
necessary
for
one
to
turn
a
calvinist
rather
than
remain
a
catholic
but
when
it
crowns
the
expectation
and
those
who
hoped
that
god
would
bless
the
remedies
see
themselves
healed
without
remedies
no
sign
has
ever
happened
on
the
part
of
the
devil
without
a
stronger
sign
on
the
part
of
god
or
even
without
it
having
been
foretold
that
such
would
happen
unjust
persecutors
of
those
whom
god
visibly
protects
if
they
reproach
you
with
your
excesses
they
speak
as
the
heretics
if
they
say
that
the
grace
of
jesus
christ
distinguishes
us
they
are
heretics
if
they
do
miracles
it
is
the
mark
of
their
heresy
they
say
these
are
the
people
of
god
who
speak
thus
it
is
said
believe
in
the
church
but
it
is
not
said
believe
in
miracles
because
the
last
is
natural
and
not
the
first
the
one
had
need
of
a
precept
not
the
other
hezekiah
the
synagogue
was
only
a
type
and
thus
it
did
not
perish
and
it
was
only
a
type
and
so
it
is
decayed
it
was
a
type
which
contained
the
truth
and
thus
it
has
lasted
until
it
no
longer
contained
the
truth
my
reverend
father
all
this
happened
in
types
other
religions
perish
this
one
perishes
not
miracles
are
more
important
than
you
think
they
have
served
for
the
foundation
and
will
serve
for
the
continuation
of
the
church
till
antichrist
till
the
end
the

the

not

show
that
we

we
must
judge
soberly
of

my
father
saint
paul
in
the
isle
of
malta
the
hardness
of
the
jesuits
then
surpasses
that
of
the
jews
since
those
refused
to
believe
jesus
christ
innocent
only
because
they
doubted
if
his
miracles
were
of
god
whereas
the
jesuits
though
unable
to
doubt
that
the
miracles
of
are
of
god
do
not
cease
to
doubt
still
the
innocence
of
that
house

you

there
would
be
too
great
darkness
if
truth
had
not
visible
signs
this
is
a
wonderful
one
that
it
has
always
been
preserved
in
one
church
and
one
visible
assembly
of
men
there
would
be
too
great
clearness
if
there
were
only
one
opinion
in
this
church
but
in
order
to
recognise
what
is
true
one
has
only
to
look
at
what
has
always
existed
for
it
is
certain
that
truth
has
always
existed
and
that
nothing
false
has
always
existed
the
history
of
the
church
ought
properly
to
be
called
the
history
of
truth
there
is
a
pleasure
in
being
in
a
ship
beaten
about
by
a
storm
when
we
are
sure
that
it
will
not
founder
the
persecutions
which
harass
the
church
are
of
this
nature
in
addition
to
so
many
other
signs
of
piety
they
are
also
persecuted
which
is
the
best
sign
of
piety
the
church
is
in
an
excellent
state
when
it
is
sustained
by
god
only
the
church
has
always
been
attacked
by
opposite
errors
but
perhaps
never
at
the
same
time
as
now
and
if
she
suffer
more
because
of
the
multiplicity
of
errors
she
derives
this
advantage
from
it
that
they
destroy
each
other
she
complains
of
both
but
far
more
of
the
calvinists
because
of
the
schism
it
is
certain
that
many
of
the
two
opposite
sects
are
deceived
they
must
be
disillusioned
faith
embraces
many
truths
which
seem
to
contradict
each
other
is
a
time
to
laugh
and
a
time
to
etc
ne
etc
the
source
of
this
is
the
union
of
the
two
natures
in
jesus
christ
and
also
the
two
worlds
the
creation
of
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
a
new
life
and
a
new
death
all
things
double
and
the
same
names
remaining
and
finally
the
two
natures
that
are
in
the
righteous
for
they
are
the
two
worlds
and
a
member
and
image
of
jesus
christ
and
thus
all
the
names
suit
them
righteous
yet
sinners
dead
yet
living
living
yet
dead
elect
yet
outcast
there
are
then
a
great
number
of
truths
both
of
faith
and
of
morality
which
seem
contradictory
and
which
all
hold
good
together
in
a
wonderful
system
the
source
of
all
heresies
is
the
exclusion
of
some
of
these
truths
and
the
source
of
all
the
objections
which
the
heretics
make
against
us
is
the
ignorance
of
some
of
our
truths
and
it
generally
happens
that
unable
to
conceive
the
connection
of
two
opposite
truths
and
believing
that
the
admission
of
one
involves
the
exclusion
of
the
other
they
adhere
to
the
one
exclude
the
other
and
think
of
us
as
opposed
to
them
now
exclusion
is
the
cause
of
their
heresy
and
ignorance
that
we
hold
the
other
truth
causes
their
objections
example
jesus
christ
is
god
and
man
the
arians
unable
to
reconcile
these
things
which
they
believe
incompatible
say
that
he
is
man
in
this
they
are
catholics
but
they
deny
that
he
is
god
in
this
they
are
heretics
they
allege
that
we
deny
his
humanity
in
this
they
are
ignorant
example
on
the
subject
of
the
holy
sacrament
we
believe
that
the
substance
of
the
bread
being
changed
and
being
consubstantial
with
that
of
the
body
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
is
therein
really
present
that
is
one
truth
another
is
that
this
sacrament
is
also
a
type
of
the
cross
and
of
glory
and
a
commemoration
of
the
two
that
is
the
catholic
faith
which
comprehends
these
two
truths
which
seem
opposed
the
heresy
of
not
conceiving
that
this
sacrament
contains
at
the
same
time
both
the
presence
of
jesus
christ
and
a
type
of
him
and
that
it
is
a
sacrifice
and
a
commemoration
of
a
sacrifice
believes
that
neither
of
these
truths
can
be
admitted
without
excluding
the
other
for
this
reason
they
fasten
to
this
point
alone
that
this
sacrament
is
typical
and
in
this
they
are
not
heretics
they
think
that
we
exclude
this
truth
hence
it
comes
that
they
raise
so
many
objections
to
us
out
of
the
passages
of
the
fathers
which
assert
it
finally
they
deny
the
presence
and
in
this
they
are
heretics
example
indulgences
the
shortest
way
therefore
to
prevent
heresies
is
to
instruct
in
all
truths
and
the
surest
way
to
refute
them
is
to
declare
them
all
for
what
will
the
heretics
say
in
order
to
know
whether
an
opinion
is
a
father
all
err
the
more
dangerously
as
they
each
follow
a
truth
their
fault
is
not
in
following
a
falsehood
but
in
not
following
another
truth
truth
is
so
obscure
in
these
times
and
falsehood
so
established
that
unless
we
love
the
truth
we
can
not
know
it
if
there
is
ever
a
time
in
which
we
must
make
profession
of
two
opposite
truths
it
is
when
we
are
reproached
for
omitting
one
therefore
the
jesuits
and
jansenists
are
wrong
in
concealing
them
but
the
jansenists
more
so
for
the
jesuits
have
better
made
profession
of
the
two
two
kinds
of
people
make
things
equal
to
one
another
as
feasts
to
working
days
christians
to
priests
all
things
among
them
etc
and
hence
the
one
party
conclude
that
what
is
then
bad
for
priests
is
also
so
for
christians
and
the
other
that
what
is
not
bad
for
christians
is
lawful
for
priests
if
the
ancient
church
was
in
error
the
church
is
fallen
if
she
should
be
in
error
it
is
not
the
same
thing
for
she
has
always
the
superior
maxim
of
tradition
from
the
hand
of
the
ancient
church
and
so
this
submission
and
this
conformity
to
the
ancient
church
prevail
and
correct
all
but
the
ancient
church
did
not
assume
the
future
church
and
did
not
consider
her
as
we
assume
and
consider
the
ancient
that
which
hinders
us
in
comparing
what
formerly
occurred
in
the
church
with
what
we
see
there
now
is
that
we
generally
look
upon
saint
athanasius
saint
theresa
and
the
rest
as
crowned
with
glory
and
acting
towards
us
as
gods
now
that
time
has
cleared
up
things
it
does
so
appear
but
at
the
time
when
he
was
persecuted
this
great
saint
was
a
man
called
athanasius
and
saint
theresa
was
a
nun
elias
was
a
man
subject
to
like
passions
as
we
are
says
saint
james
to
disabuse
christians
of
that
false
idea
which
makes
us
reject
the
example
of
the
saints
as
disproportioned
to
our
state
they
were
saints
say
we
they
are
not
like
us
what
then
actually
happened
saint
athanasius
was
a
man
called
athanasius
accused
of
many
crimes
condemned
by
such
and
such
a
council
for
such
and
such
a
crime
all
the
bishops
assented
to
it
and
finally
the
pope
what
said
they
to
those
who
opposed
this
that
they
disturbed
the
peace
that
they
created
schism
etc
zeal

four
kinds
of

knowledge
without

neither

nor

both
zeal
and
knowledge
the
first
three
condemned
him
the
last
acquitted
him
were
excommunicated
by
the
church
and
yet
saved
the
church
if
saint
augustine
came
at
the
present
time
and
was
as
little
authorised
as
his
defenders
he
would
accomplish
nothing
god
directs
his
church
well
by
having
sent
him
before
with
authority
god
has
not
wanted
to
absolve
without
the
church
as
she
has
part
in
the
offence
he
desires
her
to
have
part
in
the
pardon
he
associates
her
with
this
power
as
kings
their
parliaments
but
if
she
absolves
or
binds
without
god
she
is
no
longer
the
church
for
as
in
the
case
of
parliament
even
if
the
king
have
pardoned
a
man
it
must
be
ratified
but
if
parliament
ratifies
without
the
king
or
refuses
to
ratify
on
the
order
of
the
king
it
is
no
longer
the
parliament
of
the
king
but
a
rebellious
assembly
church
the
pope
unity
considering
the
church
as
a
unity
the
pope
who
is
its
head
is
as
the
whole
considering
it
as
a
plurality
the
pope
is
only
a
part
of
it
the
fathers
have
considered
the
church
now
in
the
one
way
now
in
the
other
and
thus
they
have
spoken
differently
of
the
pope
saint
cyprian
but
in
establishing
one
of
these
truths
they
have
not
excluded
the
other
plurality
which
is
not
reduced
to
unity
is
confusion
unity
which
does
not
depend
on
plurality
is
tyranny
there
is
scarcely
any
other
country
than
france
in
which
it
is
permissible
to
say
that
the
council
is
above
the
pope
the
pope
is
head
who
else
is
known
of
all
who
else
is
recognised
by
all
having
power
to
insinuate
himself
into
all
the
body
because
he
holds
the
principal
shoot
which
insinuates
itself
everywhere
how
easy
it
was
to
make
this
degenerate
into
tyranny
that
is
why
christ
has
laid
down
for
them
this
precept
autem
non
the
pope
hates
and
fears
the
learned
who
do
not
submit
to
him
at
will
we
must
not
judge
of
what
the
pope
is
by
some
words
of
the
fathers
as
the
greeks
said
in
a
council
important
rules
but
by
the
acts
of
the
church
and
the
fathers
and
by
the
canons
aut
tres
in
unity
and
plurality
it
is
an
error
to
exclude
one
of
the
two
as
the
papists
do
who
exclude
plurality
or
the
huguenots
who
exclude
unity
would
the
pope
be
dishonoured
by
having
his
knowledge
from
god
and
tradition
and
is
it
not
dishonouring
him
to
separate
him
from
this
holy
union
god
does
not
perform
miracles
in
the
ordinary
conduct
of
his
church
it
would
be
a
strange
miracle
if
infallibility
existed
in
one
man
but
it
appears
so
natural
for
it
to
reside
in
a
multitude
since
the
conduct
of
god
is
hidden
under
nature
as
in
all
his
other
works
kings
dispose
of
their
own
power
but
the
popes
can
not
dispose
of
theirs
jus
summa
the
majority
is
the
best
way
because
it
is
visible
and
has
strength
to
make
itself
obeyed
yet
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
least
able
if
men
could
have
done
it
they
would
have
placed
might
in
the
hands
of
justice
but
as
might
does
not
allow
itself
to
be
managed
as
men
want
because
it
is
a
palpable
quality
whereas
justice
is
a
spiritual
quality
of
which
men
dispose
as
they
please
they
have
placed
justice
in
the
hands
of
might
and
thus
that
is
called
just
which
men
are
forced
to
obey
hence
comes
the
right
of
the
sword
for
the
sword
gives
a
true
right
otherwise
we
should
see
violence
on
one
side
and
justice
on
the
other
end
of
the
twelfth
hence
comes
the
injustice
of
the
fronde
which
raises
its
alleged
justice
against
power
it
is
not
the
same
in
the
church
for
there
is
a
true
justice
and
no
violence
jurisdiction
is
not
given
for
the
sake
of
the
judge
but
for
that
of
the
litigant
it
is
dangerous
to
tell
this
to
the
people
but
the
people
have
too
much
faith
in
you
it
will
not
harm
them
and
may
serve
you
it
should
therefore
be
made
known
oves
non
you
owe
me
pasturage
men
like
certainty
they
like
the
pope
to
be
infallible
in
faith
and
grave
doctors
to
be
infallible
in
morals
so
as
to
have
certainty
the
church
teaches
and
god
inspires
both
infallibly
the
work
of
the
church
is
of
use
only
as
a
preparation
for
grace
or
condemnation
what
it
does
is
enough
for
condemnation
not
for
inspiration
every
time
the
jesuits
may
impose
upon
the
pope
they
will
make
all
christendom
perjured
the
pope
is
very
easily
imposed
upon
because
of
his
occupations
and
the
confidence
which
he
has
in
the
jesuits
and
the
jesuits
are
very
capable
of
imposing
upon
him
by
means
of
calumny
the
wretches
who
have
obliged
me
to
speak
of
the
basis
of
religion
sinners
purified
without
penitence
the
righteous
justified
without
love
all
christians
without
the
grace
of
jesus
christ
god
without
power
over
the
will
of
men
a
predestination
without
mystery
a
redemption
without
certitude
any
one
is
made
a
priest
who
wants
to
be
so
as
under
jeroboam
it
is
a
horrible
thing
that
they
propound
to
us
the
discipline
of
the
church
of
as
so
good
that
it
is
made
a
crime
to
desire
to
change
it
formerly
it
was
infallibly
good
and
it
was
thought
that
it
could
be
changed
without
sin
and
now
such
as
it
is
we
can
not
wish
it
changed
it
has
indeed
been
permitted
to
change
the
custom
of
not
making
priests
without
such
great
circumspection
that
there
were
hardly
any
who
were
worthy
and
it
is
not
allowed
to
complain
of
the
custom
which
makes
so
many
who
are
unworthy
ezekiel
all
the
heathen
and
also
the
prophet
spoke
evil
of
israel
but
the
israelites
were
so
far
from
having
the
right
to
say
to
him
you
speak
like
the
heathen
that
he
is
most
forcible
upon
this
that
the
heathen
say
the
same
as
he
the
jansenists
are
like
the
heretics
in
the
reformation
of
morality
but
you
are
like
them
in
evil
you
are
ignorant
of
the
prophecies
if
you
do
not
know
that
all
this
must
happen
princes
prophets
pope
and
even
the
priests
and
yet
the
church
is
to
abide
by
the
grace
of
god
we
have
not
come
to
that
woe
to
these
priests
but
we
hope
that
god
will
bestow
his
mercy
upon
us
that
we
shall
not
be
of
them
saint
peter
ii
false
prophets
in
the
past
the
image
of
future
ones
so
that
if
it
is
true
on
the
one
hand
that
some
lax
monks
and
some
corrupt
casuists
who
are
not
members
of
the
hierarchy
are
steeped
in
these
corruptions
it
is
on
the
other
hand
certain
that
the
true
pastors
of
the
church
who
are
the
true
guardians
of
the
divine
word
have
preserved
it
unchangeably
against
the
efforts
of
those
who
have
attempted
to
destroy
it
and
thus
true
believers
have
no
pretext
to
follow
that
laxity
which
is
only
offered
to
them
by
the
strange
hands
of
these
casuists
instead
of
the
sound
doctrine
which
is
presented
to
them
by
the
fatherly
hands
of
their
own
pastors
and
the
ungodly
and
heretics
have
no
ground
for
publishing
these
abuses
as
evidence
of
imperfection
in
the
providence
of
god
over
his
church
since
the
church
consisting
properly
in
the
body
of
the
hierarchy
we
are
so
far
from
being
able
to
conclude
from
the
present
state
of
matters
that
god
has
abandoned
her
to
corruption
that
it
has
never
been
more
apparent
than
at
the
present
time
that
god
visibly
protects
her
from
corruption
for
if
some
of
these
men
who
by
an
extraordinary
vocation
have
made
profession
of
withdrawing
from
the
world
and
adopting
the
monks
dress
in
order
to
live
in
a
more
perfect
state
than
ordinary
christians
have
fallen
into
excesses
which
horrify
ordinary
christians
and
have
become
to
us
what
the
false
prophets
were
among
the
jews
this
is
a
private
and
personal
misfortune
which
must
indeed
be
deplored
but
from
which
nothing
can
be
inferred
against
the
care
which
god
takes
of
his
church
since
all
these
things
are
so
clearly
foretold
and
it
has
been
so
long
since
announced
that
these
temptations
would
arise
from
people
of
this
kind
so
that
when
we
are
well
instructed
we
see
in
this
rather
evidence
of
the
care
of
god
than
of
his
forgetfulness
in
regard
to
us
tertullian
ecclesia
heretics
who
take
advantage
of
the
doctrine
of
the
jesuits
must
be
made
to
know
that
it
is
not
that
of
the
church
doctrine
of
the
and
that
our
divisions
do
not
separate
us
from
the
altar
if
in
differing
we
condemned
you
would
be
right
uniformity
without
diversity
is
useless
to
others
diversity
without
uniformity
is
ruinous
for
us
the
one
is
harmful
outwardly
the
other
inwardly
by
showing
the
truth
we
cause
it
to
be
believed
but
by
showing
the
injustice
of
ministers
we
do
not
correct
it
our
mind
is
assured
by
a
proof
of
falsehood
our
purse
is
not
made
secure
by
proof
of
injustice
those
who
love
the
church
lament
to
see
the
corruption
of
morals
but
laws
at
least
exist
but
these
corrupt
the
laws
the
model
is
damaged
men
never
do
evil
so
completely
and
cheerfully
as
when
they
do
it
from
religious
conviction
it
is
in
vain
that
the
church
has
established
these
words
anathemas
heresies
etc
they
are
used
against
her
the
servant
knoweth
not
what
his
lord
doeth
for
the
master
tells
him
only
the
act
and
not
the
intention
and
this
is
why
he
often
obeys
slavishly
and
defeats
the
intention
but
jesus
christ
has
told
us
the
object
and
you
defeat
that
object
they
can
not
have
perpetuity
and
they
seek
universality
and
therefore
they
make
the
whole
church
corrupt
that
they
may
be
saints
those
who
misuse
passages
of
scripture
and
who
pride
themselves
in
finding
one
which

he

is
for
you
a
person
who
says
i
am
neither
for
nor

we
ought
to
reply
to
him
he
who
will
give
the
meaning
of

does
not

says
feuillant
that
this
is
not

certain
for

indicates
uncertainty
saint

saint
chrysostom
morals
unbelievers
the
jesuits
have
not
made
the
truth
uncertain
but
they
have
made
their
own
ungodliness
certain
contradiction
has
always
been
permitted
in
order
to
blind
the
wicked
for
all
that
offends
truth
or
love
is
evil
this
is
the
true
principle
all
religions
and
sects
in
the
world
have
had
natural
reason
for
a
guide
christians
alone
have
been
constrained
to
take
their
rules
from
without
themselves
and
to
acquaint
themselves
with
those
which
jesus
christ
bequeathed
to
men
of
old
to
be
handed
down
to
true
believers
this
constraint
wearies
these
good
fathers
they
desire
like
other
people
to
have
liberty
to
follow
their
own
imaginations
it
is
in
vain
that
we
cry
to
them
as
the
prophets
said
to
the
jews
of
old
enter
into
the
church
acquaint
yourselves
with
the
precepts
which
the
men
of
old
left
to
her
and
follow
those
paths
they
have
answered
like
the
jews
we
will
not
walk
in
them
but
we
will
follow
the
thoughts
of
our
hearts
and
they
have
said
we
will
be
as
the
other
nations
they
make
a
rule
of
exception
have
the
men
of
old
given
absolution
before
penance
do
this
as
exceptional
but
of
the
exception
you
make
a
rule
without
exception
so
that
you
do
not
even
want
the
rule
to
be
exceptional
confessions
and
absolutions
without
signs
of
god
regards
only
the
inward
the
church
judges
only
by
the
outward
god
absolves
as
soon
as
he
sees
penitence
in
the
heart
the
church
when
she
sees
it
in
works
god
will
make
a
church
pure
within
which
confounds
by
its
inward
and
entirely
spiritual
holiness
the
inward
impiety
of
proud
sages
and
pharisees
and
the
church
will
make
an
assembly
of
men
whose
external
manners
are
so
pure
as
to
confound
the
manners
of
the
heathen
if
there
are
hypocrites
among
them
but
so
well
disguised
that
she
does
not
discover
their
venom
she
tolerates
them
for
though
they
are
not
accepted
of
god
whom
they
can
not
deceive
they
are
of
men
whom
they
do
deceive
and
thus
she
is
not
dishonoured
by
their
conduct
which
appears
holy
but
you
want
the
church
to
judge
neither
of
the
inward
because
that
belongs
to
god
alone
nor
of
the
outward
because
god
dwells
only
upon
the
inward
and
thus
taking
away
from
her
all
choice
of
men
you
retain
in
the
church
the
most
dissolute
and
those
who
dishonour
her
so
greatly
that
the
synagogues
of
the
jews
and
sects
of
philosophers
would
have
banished
them
as
unworthy
and
have
abhorred
them
as
impious
the
easiest
conditions
to
live
in
according
to
the
world
are
the
most
difficult
to
live
in
according
to
god
and
vice
versa
nothing
is
so
difficult
according
to
the
world
as
the
religious
life
nothing
is
easier
than
to
live
it
according
to
god
nothing
is
easier
according
to
the
world
than
to
live
in
high
office
and
great
wealth
nothing
is
more
difficult
than
to
live
in
them
according
to
god
and
without
acquiring
an
interest
in
them
and
a
liking
for
them
the
casuists
submit
the
decision
to
the
corrupt
reason
and
the
choice
of
decisions
to
the
corrupt
will
in
order
that
all
that
is
corrupt
in
the
nature
of
man
may
contribute
to
his
conduct
but
is
it
that
gives
assurance
difference
between
rest
and
security
of
conscience
nothing
gives
certainty
but
truth
nothing
gives
rest
but
the
sincere
search
for
truth
the
whole
society
itself
of
their
casuists
can
not
give
assurance
to
a
conscience
in
error
and
that
is
why
it
is
important
to
choose
good
guides
thus
they
will
be
doubly
culpable
both
in
having
followed
ways
which
they
should
not
have
followed
and
in
having
listened
to
teachers
to
whom
they
should
not
have
listened
can
it
be
anything
but
compliance
with
the
world
which
makes
you
find
things
probable
will
you
make
us
believe
that
it
is
truth
and
that
if
duelling
were
not
the
fashion
you
would
find
it
probable
that
they
might
fight
considering
the
matter
in
itself
must
we
kill
to
prevent
there
being
any
wicked
this
is
to
make
both
parties
wicked
instead
of
one

ethics
and
language
are
special
but
universal
sciences
each
one
can
employ
it
no
one
can
take
it
away
they
allow
lust
to
act
and
check
scruples
whereas
they
should
do
the
contrary
lax
opinions
please
men
so
much
that
it
is
strange
that
theirs
displease
it
is
because
they
have
exceeded
all
bounds
again
there
are
many
people
who
see
the
truth
and
who
can
not
attain
to
it
but
there
are
few
who
do
not
know
that
the
purity
of
religion
is
opposed
to
our
corruptions
it
is
absurd
to
say
that
an
eternal
recompense
is
offered
to
the
morality
of
escobar
they
have
some
true
principles
but
they
misuse
them
now
the
abuse
of
truth
ought
to
be
as
much
punished
as
the
introduction
of
falsehood
as
if
there
were
two
hells
one
for
sins
against
love
the
other
for
those
against
justice
the
earnestness
of
the
saints
in
seeking
the
truth
was
useless
if
the
probable
is
trustworthy
the
fear
of
the
saints
who
have
always
followed
the
surest
way
saint
theresa
having
always
followed
her
confessor
take
away
and
you
can
no
longer
please
the
world
give
and
you
can
no
longer
displease
it
these
are
the
effects
of
the
sins
of
the
peoples
and
of
the
jesuits
the
great
have
wished
to
be
flattered
the
jesuits
have
wished
to
be
loved
by
the
great
they
have
all
been
worthy
to
be
abandoned
to
the
spirit
of
lying
the
one
party
to
deceive
the
others
to
be
deceived
they
have
been
avaricious
ambitious
voluptuous
tibi
worthy
disciples
of
such
masters
they
have
sought
flatterers
and
have
found
them
if
they
do
not
renounce
their
doctrine
of
probability
their
good
maxims
are
as
little
holy
as
the
bad
for
they
are
founded
on
human
authority
and
thus
if
they
are
more
just
they
will
be
more
reasonable
but
not
more
holy
they
take
after
the
wild
stem
on
which
they
are
grafted
if
what
i
say
does
not
serve
to
enlighten
you
it
will
be
of
use
to
the
people
if
these
are
silent
the
stones
will
speak
silence
is
the
greatest
persecution
the
saints
were
never
silent
it
is
true
that
a
call
is
necessary
but
it
is
not
from
the
decrees
of
the
council
that
we
must
learn
whether
we
are
called
it
is
from
the
necessity
of
speaking
now
after
rome
has
spoken
and
we
think
that
she
has
condemned
the
truth
and
that
they
have
written
it
and
after
the
books
which
have
said
the
contrary
are
censured
we
must
cry
out
so
much
the
louder
the
more
unjustly
we
are
censured
and
the
more
violently
they
would
stifle
speech
until
there
come
a
pope
who
hears
both
parties
and
who
consults
antiquity
to
do
justice
so
the
good
popes
will
find
the
church
still
in
outcry
the
inquisition
and
the
society
are
the
two
scourges
of
the
truth
why
do
you
not
accuse
them
of
arianism
for
though
they
have
said
that
jesus
christ
is
god
perhaps
they
mean
by
it
not
the
natural
interpretation
but
as
it
is
said
if
my
letters
are
condemned
at
rome
that
which
i
condemn
in
them
is
condemned
in
heaven
tuum
domine
jesu
tribunal
you
yourselves
are
corruptible
i
feared
that
i
had
written
ill
seeing
myself
condemned
but
the
example
of
so
many
pious
writings
makes
me
believe
the
contrary
it
is
no
longer
allowable
to
write
well
so
corrupt
or
ignorant
is
the
inquisition
it
is
better
to
obey
god
than
men
i
fear
nothing
i
hope
for
nothing
it
is
not
so
with
the
bishops
fears
and
it
is
bad
policy
to
disperse
them
for
they
will
fear
no
longer
and
will
cause
greater
fear
i
do
not
even
fear
your
like
censures
if
they
are
not
founded
on
those
of
tradition
do
you
censure
all
what
even
my
respect
no
say
then
what
or
you
will
do
nothing
if
you
do
not
point
out
the
evil
and
why
it
is
evil
and
this
is
what
they
will
have
great
difficulty
in
doing
they
have
given
a
ridiculous
explanation
of
certitude
for
after
having
established
that
all
their
ways
are
sure
they
have
no
longer
called
that
sure
which
leads
to
heaven
without
danger
of
not
arriving
there
by
it
but
that
which
leads
there
without
danger
of
going
out
of
that
road
the
saints
indulge
in
subtleties
in
order
to
think
themselves
criminals
and
impeach
their
better
actions
and
these
indulge
in
subtleties
in
order
to
excuse
the
most
wicked
the
heathen
sages
erected
a
structure
equally
fine
outside
but
upon
a
bad
foundation
and
the
devil
deceived
men
by
this
apparent
resemblance
based
upon
the
most
different
foundation
man
never
had
so
good
a
cause
as
i
and
others
have
never
furnished
so
good
a
capture
as
you
the
more
they
point
out
weakness
in
my
person
the
more
they
authorise
my
cause
you
say
that
i
am
a
heretic
is
that
lawful
and
if
you
do
not
fear
that
men
do
justice
do
you
not
fear
that
god
does
justice
you
will
feel
the
force
of
the
truth
and
you
will
yield
to
it
there

which
is

having

the

we

by

that

it
is
that

action
by
not

it
it
is
not
absolution

which

the

difference
between
the
mathematical
and
the
intuitive
pascal
is
here
distinguishing
the
logical
or
discursive
type
of
mind
a
good
example
of
which
is
found
in
mathematical
reasoning
and
what
we
should
call
the
intuitive
type
of
mind
which
sees
everything
at
a
glance
a
practical
man
of
sound
judgment
exemplifies
the
latter
for
he
is
in
fact
guided
by
impressions
of
past
experience
and
does
not
consciously
reason
from
general
principles
are
different
this
is
probably
a
subdivision
of
the
discursive
type
of
mind
this
is
an
emendation
by

out
your
own
salvation
with
fear
proofs
of
prayer
therefore
it
is
in
our
power
to
ask
on
the
other
hand
there
is
god
so
it
is
not
in
our
power
since
the
obtaining
of
the
grace
to
pray
to
him
is
not
in
our
power
for
since
salvation
is
not
in
us
and
the
obtaining
of
such
grace
is
from
him
prayer
is
not
in
our
power
the
righteous
man
should
then
hope
no
more
in
god
for
he
ought
not
to
hope
but
to
strive
to
obtain
what
he
wants
let
us
conclude
then
that
since
man
is
now
unrighteous
since
the
first
sin
and
god
is
unwilling
that
he
should
thereby
not
be
estranged
from
him
it
is
only
by
a
first
effect
that
he
is
not
estranged
therefore
those
who
depart
from
god
have
not
this
first
effect
without
which
they
are
not
estranged
from
god
and
those
who
do
not
depart
from
god
have
this
first
effect
therefore
those
whom
we
have
seen
possessed
for
some
time
of
grace
by
this
first
effect
cease
to
pray
for
want
of
this
first
effect
then
god
abandons
the
first
in
this
sense
it
is
doubtful
however
that
this
fragment
should
be
included
in
the
and
it
has
seemed
best
to
separate
it
from
the
text
it
has
only
once
before
appeared
in
the
edition
of
michaut
the
first
half
of
it
has
been
freely
translated
in
order
to
give
an
interpretation
in
accordance
with
a
suggestion
from
emile
boutroux
the
eminent
authority
on
pascal
the
meaning
seems
to
be
this
in
one
sense
it
is
in
our
power
to
ask
from
god
who
promises
to
give
us
what
we
ask
but
in
another
sense
it
is
not
in
our
power
to
ask
for
it
is
not
in
our
power
to
obtain
the
grace
which
is
necessary
in
asking
we
know
that
salvation
is
not
in
our
power
therefore
some
condition
of
salvation
is
not
in
our
power
now
the
conditions
of
salvation
are
two
the
asking
for
it
and
the
obtaining
it
but
god
promises
to
give
us
what
we
ask
hence
the
obtaining
is
in
our
power
therefore
the
condition
which
is
not
in
our
power
must
be
the
first
namely
the
asking
prayer
presupposes
a
grace
which
it
is
not
within
our
power
to
obtain
after
giving
the
utmost
consideration
to
the
second
half
of
this
obscure
fragment

seeking
