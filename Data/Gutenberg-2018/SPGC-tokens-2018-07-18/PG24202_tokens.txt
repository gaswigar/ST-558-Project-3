in
the
huge
shed
of
the
wharf
piled
with
crates
and
baggage
broken
by
leading
up
to
ships
on
either
side
a
band
plays
a
tinselly
hawaiian
tune
people
are
dancing
in
and
out
among
the
piles
of
trunks
and
boxes
there
is
a
scattering
of
khaki
uniforms
and
many
young
men
stand
in
groups
laughing
and
talking
in
voices
pitched
shrill
with
excitement
in
the
brown
light
of
the
wharf
full
of
rows
of
yellow
crates
and
barrels
and
sacks
full
of
racket
of
cranes
among
which
winds
in
and
out
the
trivial
lilt
of
the
hawaiian
tune
there
is
a
flutter
of
gay
dresses
and
coloured
hats
of
women
and
white
handkerchiefs
the
booming
reverberation
of
the
ship
whistle
drowns
all
other
sound
after
it
the
noise
of
farewells
rises
shrill
white
handkerchiefs
are
agitated
in
the
brown
light
of
the
shed
ropes
crack
in
pulleys
as
the
are
raised
again
at
the
pierhead
white
handkerchiefs
and
cheering
and
a
flutter
of
coloured
dresses
on
the

a
flag
spreads
exultingly
against
the
azure
afternoon
sky
rosy
yellow
and
drab

together
into

smudges
of

breath

martin
howe
stands
in
the
stern
that
trembles
with
the
vibrating
push
of
the
screw
a
boy
standing
beside
him
turns
and
asks
in
a
tremulous
voice
this
your
first
time
across
yes
yours
yes
i
never
used
to
think
that
at
nineteen
i
be
crossing
the
atlantic
to
go
to
a
war
in
france
the
boy
caught
himself
up
suddenly
and
blushed
then
swallowing
a
lump
in
his
throat
he
said
it
ought
to
be
time
to
eat
help
kaiser
bill
old
uncle
sam
he
got
the
cavalry
he
got
the
infantry
he
got
the
artillery
and
then
by
god
we
all
go
to
germany
god
help
kaiser
bill
the
iron
covers
are
clamped
on
the
windows
for
no
lights
must
show
so
the
air
is
dense
with
tobacco
smoke
and
the
reek
of
beer
and
champagne
in
one
corner
they
are
playing
poker
with
their
coats
off
all
the
chairs
are
full
of
sprawling
young
men
who
stamp
their
feet
to
the
time
and
bang
their
fists
down
so
that
the
bottles
dance
on
the
tables
help

are
opal
grey
martin
is
stretched
on
the
deck
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
with
an
unopened
book
beside
him
he
has
never
been
so
happy
in
his
life
the
future
is
nothing
to
him
the
past
is
nothing
to
him
all
his
life
is
effaced
in
the
grey
languor
of
the
sea
in
the
soft
surge
of
the
water
about
the
ship
bow
as
she
ploughs
through
the
long
swell
eastward
the
tepid
moisture
of
the
gulf
stream
makes
his
clothes
feel
damp
and
his
hair
stick
together
into
curls
that
straggle
over
his
forehead
there
are
porpoises
about
lazily
tumbling
in
the
swell
and
skim
from
one
grey
wave
to
another
and
the
bow
rises
and
falls
gently
in
rhythm
with
the
surging
of
the
broken
water
martin
has
been
asleep
as
through
infinite
mists
of
greyness
he
looks
back
on
the
sharp
hatreds
and
wringing
desires
of
his
life
now
a
leaf
seems
to
have
been
turned
and
a
new
white
page
spread
before
him
clean
and
unwritten
on
at
last
things
have
come
to
pass
and
very
faintly
like
music
heard
across
the
water
in
the
evening
blurred
into
strange
harmonies
his
old
watchwords
echo
a
little
in
his
mind
like
the
red
flame
of
the
sunset
setting
fire
to
opal
sea
and
sky
the
old
exaltation
the
old
flame
that
would
consume
to
ashes
all
the
lies
in
the
world
the
under
which
the
walls
of
jericho
would
fall
down
stirs
and
broods
in
the
womb
of
his
grey
lassitude
the
bow
rises
and
falls
gently
in
rhythm
with
the
surging
of
the
broken
water
as
the
steamer
ploughs
through
the
long
swell
of
the
gulf
stream
eastward
see
that
guy
the
feller
with
the
straw
hat
he
lost
five
hundred
dollars
at
craps
last
night
some
stakes
it
is
almost
dark
sea
and
sky
are
glowing
claret
colour
darkened
to
a
cold
to
westward
in
a
corner
of
the
deck
a
number
of
men
are
crowded
in
a
circle
while
one
shakes
the
dice
in
his
hand
with
a
strange
nervous
quiver
that
ends
in
a
snap
of
the
fingers
as
the
white
dice
roll
on
the
deck
seven
up
from
the
comes
a
sound
of
singing
and
glasses
banged
on
tables
we
bound
for
the
hamburg
show
to
see
the
elephant
and
the
wild
kangaroo
an
we
all
stick
together
in
fair
or
foul
weather
for
we
going
to
see
the
damn
show
through
on
the
settee
a
sallow
young
man
is
shaking
the
ice
in
a
into
a
nervous
tinkle
as
he
talks
there
nothing
they
can
do
against
this
new
gas
it
just
corrodes
the
lungs
as
if
they
were
rotten
in
a
dead
body
in
the
hospitals
they
just
stand
the
poor
devils
up
against
a
wall
and
let
them
die
they
say
their
skin
turns
green
and
that
it
takes
from
five
to
seven
days
to
die
five
to
seven
days
of
slow
choking
oh
but
i
think
it
so
splendid
of
you
she
bared
all
her
teeth
white
and
regular
as
those
in
a
dentist
in
a
smile
as
she
spoke
to
come
over
this
way
to
help
france
perhaps
it
only
curiosity
muttered
martin
oh
no
you
too
modest
what
i
mean
is
that
it
so
splendid
to
have
understood
the
issues
that
how
i
feel
i
just
told
dad
have
to
come
and
do
my
bit
as
the
english
say
what
are
you
going
to
do
something
in
paris
i
do
know
just
what
but
i
certainly
make
myself
useful
somehow
she
beamed
at
him
provocatively
oh
if
only
i
was
a
man
i
have
shouldered
my
gun
the
first
day
indeed
i
would
but
the
issues
were
hardly
defined
then
ventured
martin
they
did
need
to
be
i
hate
those
brutes
i
always
hated
the
germans
their
language
their
country
everything
about
them
and
now
that
they
done
such
frightful
things
i
wonder
if
it
all
true
true
oh
of
course
it
all
true
and
lots
more
that
it
has
been
possible
to
print
that
people
have
been
ashamed
to
tell
they
gone
pretty
far
said
martin
laughing
if
there
are
any
left
alive
after
the
war
they
ought
to
be
chloroformed
and
really
i
do
think
it
patriotic
or
humane
to
take
the
atrocities
so
lightly
but
really
you
must
excuse
me
if
you
think
me
rude
i
do
get
so
excited
and
wrought
up
when
i
think
of
those
frightful
things
i
get
quite
beside
myself
i
sure
you
do
too
in
your
heart
any
person
would
only
i
doubt
but
you
just
playing
into
their
hands
if
you
do
that
oh
dear
i
quite
beside
myself
just
thinking
of
it
she
raised
a
small
gloved
hand
to
her
pink
cheek
in
a
gesture
of
horror
and
settled
herself
comfortably
in
her
deck
chair
really
i
ought
to
talk
about
it
i
lose
all
when
i
do
i
hate
them
so
it
makes
me
quite
ill
the
curs
the
huns
let
me
tell
you
just
one
story
i
know
it
make
your
blood
boil
it
absolutely
authentic
too
i
heard
it
before
i
left
new
york
from
a
girl
who
really
the
best
friend
i
have
on
earth
she
got
it
from
a
friend
of
hers
who
had
got
it
directly
from
a
little
belgian
girl
poor
little
thing
who
was
in
the
convent
at
the
time
oh
i
do
see
why
they
ever
take
any
prisoners
i
kill
them
all
like
mad
dogs
what
the
story
oh
i
ca
tell
it
it
upsets
me
too
much
no
that
silly
got
to
begin
facing
realities
it
was
just
when
the
germans
were
taking
bruges
the
uhlans
broke
into
this
convent
but
i
think
it
was
in
louvain
not
bruges
i
have
a
wretched
memory
for
names
well
they
broke
in
and
took
all
those
poor
defenceless
little
girls
there
the
oh
so
it
is
i
must
run
and
dress
i
have
to
tell
you
later
through
eyes
martin
watched
the
fluttering
dress
and
the
backs
of
the
neat
little
white
shoes
go
jauntily
down
the
deck
the
again
clink
of
glasses
and
chatter
of
confident
voices
two
men
talking
over
their
glasses
they
tell
me
that
paris
is
some
city
the
most
immoral
place
in
the
world
before
the
war
why
there
are
houses
there
where
his
voice
sank
into
a
whisper
the
other
man
burst
into
loud
guffaws
but
the
war
put
an
end
to
all
that
they
tell
me
that
french
people
are
regenerated
positively
regenerated
they
say
the
lack
of
food
something
awful
that
you
ca
get
a
square
meal
they
even
eat
horse
did
you
hear
what
those
fellows
were
saying
about
that
new
gas
sounds
frightful
do
it
i
do
care
a
thing
about
bullets
but
that
kind
o
gives
me
cold
feet
i
do
give
a
damn
about
bullets
but
that
gas
that
why
so
many
shoot
their
friends
when
they
gassed
say
you
two
how
about
a
hand
of
poker
a
champagne
cork
pops
jiminy
do
spill
it
all
over
me
where
we
goin
boys
we
going
to
the
hamburg
show
to
see
the
elephant
and
the
wild
kangaroo
and
we
all
stick
together
in
fair
or
foul
weather
for
we
going
to
see
the
damn
show
through
chapter
ii
before
going
to
bed
martin
had
seen
the
lighthouses
winking
at
the
mouth
of
the
gironde
and
had
filled
his
lungs
with
the
new
indefinably
scented
wind
coming
off
the
land
the
sound
of
screaming
whistles
of
awoke
him
feet
were
tramping
on
the
deck
above
his
head
the
shrill
whine
of
a
crane
sounded
in
his
ears
and
the
throaty
cry
of
men
lifting
something
in
unison
through
his
in
the
yet
colourless
dawn
he
saw
the
reddish
water
of
a
river
with
on
it
and
a
few
lanky
little
steamers
of
a
pattern
he
had
never
seen
before
again
he
breathed
deep
of
the
new
indefinable
smell
off
the
land
once
on
deck
in
the
cold
air
he
saw
through
the
faint
light
a
row
of
houses
beyond
the
low
wharf
buildings
grey
mellow
houses
of
four
storeys
with
tiled
roofs
and
intricate
ironwork
balconies
with
balconies
in
which
the
ironwork
had
been
carefully
twisted
by
artisans
long
ago
dead
into
gracefully
modulated
curves
and
spirals
some
in
uniform
some
not
the
ambulance
men
marched
to
the
station
through
the
grey
streets
of
bordeaux
once
a
woman
opened
a
window
and
crying
vive
threw
out
a
bunch
of
roses
and
daisies
as
they
were
rounding
a
corner
a
man
with
a
frockcoat
on
ran
up
and
put
his
own
hat
on
the
head
of
one
of
the
americans
who
had
none
in
front
of
the
station
waiting
for
the
train
they
sat
at
the
little
tables
of
cafés
lolling
comfortably
in
the
early
morning
sunlight
and
drank
beer
and
cognac
small
railway
carriages
into
which
they
were
crowded
so
that
their
knees
were
pressed
tight
together
and
outside
slipping
by
fields
and
poplars
stalking
out
of
the
morning
mist
and
long
drifts
of
poppies
scarlet
poppies
and
cornflowers
and
white
daisies
and
the
roofs
and
white
walls
of
cottages
all
against
a
background
of
glaucous
green
fields
and
hedges
tours
poitiers
orleans
in
the
names
of
the
stations
rose
old
wars
until
the
floods
of
scarlet
poppies
seemed
the
blood
of
fighting
men
slaughtered
through
all
time
at
last
in
the
gloaming
paris
and
in
crossing
a
bridge
over
the
seine
a
glimpse
of
the
two
linked
towers
of
rosy
grey
in
the
grey
mist
up
the
river
say
these
women
here
get
my
goat
how
do
you
mean
well
i
was
at
the
olympia
with
johnson
and
that
crowd
they
just
pester
the
life
out
of
you
there
i
heard
that
paris
was
immoral
but
nothing
like
this
it
the
war
but
the
jane
i
went
with
gee
these
frenchwomen
are
immoral
they
say
the
war
does
it
ca
be
that
nothing
is
more
purifying
than
sacrifice
a
feller
has
to
be
mighty
careful
they
say
looks
like
every
woman
you
saw
walking
on
the
street
was
a
whore
they
certainly
are
though
king
and
his
gang
are
all
being
sent
back
to
the
states
i
be
darned
they
sure
have
been
drunk
ever
since
they
got
off
the
steamer
raised
hell
in
maxim
last
night
they
tried
to
clean
up
the
place
and
the
police
came
they
were
all
soused
to
the
gills
and
tried
to
make
everybody
there
sing
the
spangled
banner
damn
fool
business
martin
howe
sat
at
a
table
on
the
sidewalk
under
the
brown
awning
of
a
restaurant
opposite
in
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
the
foliage
of
the
jardin
du
luxembourg
shone
bright
green
above
deep
alleys
of
bluish
shadow
from
the
pavements
in
front
of
the
houses
rose
little
kiosks
with
advertisements
in
bright
orange
and
vermilion
and
blue
in
the
middle
of
the
triangle
formed
by
the
streets
and
the
garden
was
a
round
pool
of
jade
water
martin
leaned
back
in
his
chair
looking
dreamily
out
through
eyes
breathing
deep
now
and
then
of
the
musty
scent
of
paris
that
mingled
with
the
melting
freshness
of
the
wild
strawberries
on
the
plate
before
him
as
he
stared
in
front
of
him
two
figures
crossed
his
field
of
vision
a
woman
swathed
in
black
crepe
veils
was
helping
a
soldier
to
a
seat
at
the
next
table
he
found
himself
staring
in
a
face
a
face
that
still
had
some
of
the
chubbiness
of
boyhood
between
the
frightened
eyes
where
the
nose
should
have
been
was
a
triangular
black
patch
that
ended
in
some
mechanical
contrivance
with
shiny
little
black
metal
rods
that
took
the
place
of
the
jaw
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
soldier
eyes
that
were
like
those
of
a
hurt
animal
full
of
meek
dismay
someone
plucked
at
martin
arm
and
he
turned
suddenly
fearfully
a
bent
old
woman
was
offering
him
flowers
with
a
jerky
curtsey
just
a
rose
for
good
luck
no
thank
you
it
will
bring
you
happiness
he
took
a
couple
of
the
reddest
of
the
roses
do
you
understand
the
language
of
flowers
no
i
shall
teach
you
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
so
much
she
added
a
few
large
daisies
to
the
red
roses
in
his
hand
these
will
bring
you
love
but
another
time
i
shall
teach
you
the
language
of
flowers
the
language
of
love
she
curtseyed
again
and
began
making
her
way
jerkily
down
the
sidewalk
jingling
his
silver
in
her
hand
he
stuck
the
roses
and
daisies
in
the
belt
of
his
uniform
and
sat
with
the
green
flame
of
chartreuse
in
a
little
glass
before
him
staring
into
the
gardens
where
the
foliage
was
becoming
blue
and
lavender
with
evening
and
the
shadows
darkened
to
and
black
now
and
then
he
glanced
furtively
with
shame
at
the
man
at
the
next
table
when
the
restaurant
closed
he
wandered
through
the
unlighted
streets
towards
the
river
listening
to
the
laughs
and
conversations
that
bubbled
like
the
sparkle
in
burgundy
through
the
purple
summer
night
but
wherever
he
looked
in
the
comradely
faces
of
young
men
in
the
beckoning
eyes
of
women
he
saw
the
brown
hurt
eyes
of
the
soldier
and
the
triangular
black
patch
where
the
nose

at

the

wrecked
the
corrugated

of
the

hung
in
strips
over
the
crumbled

the

came
over

the

gosh
is
it
let
me
get
to
the
winder
the
car
joggling
along
on
a
flat
wheel
was
full
of
the
smell
of
sweat
and
sour
wine
outside
and
crossed
by
long
processions
of
poplars
aflame
with
vermilion
and
carmine
of
poppies
the
countryside
slipped
by
at
a
station
where
the
train
stopped
on
a
siding
they
could
hear
a
faint
hollow
sound
in
the
distance
guns
croix
de
guerre
had
been
given
out
that
day
at
the
automobile
park
at
chalons
there
was
an
unusually
big
dinner
at
the
wooden
tables
in
the
narrow
portable
barracks
and
during
the
last
course
the
general
passed
through
and
drank
a
glass
of
champagne
to
the
health
of
all
present
everybody
had
on
his
best
uniform
and
sweated
hugely
in
the
narrow
airless
building
from
the
wine
and
the
champagne
and
the
thick
stew
thickly
seasoned
that
made
the
dinner
main
course
we
are
all
one
large
family
said
the
general
from
the
end
of
the
barracks
to
france
that
night
the
wail
of
a
siren
woke
martin
suddenly
and
made
him
sit
up
in
his
bunk
trembling
wondering
where
he
was
like
the
shriek
of
a
woman
in
a
nightmare
the
wail
of
the
siren
rose
and
rose
and
then
dropped
in
pitch
and
faded
throbbingly
out
do
flash
a
light
there
it
boche
planes
outside
the
night
was
cold
with
a
little
light
from
a
waned
moon
see
the
shrapnel
someone
cried
the
boche
has
a
mercedes
motor
said
someone
else
you
can
tell
by
the
sound
of
it
they
say
one
of
their
planes
chased
an
ambulance
ten
miles
along
a
straight
road
the
other
day
trying
to
get
it
with
a
the
man
who
was
driving
got
away
but
he
had
afterwards
did
he
really
oh
i
goin
to
turn
in
god
these
french
nights
are
cold
the
rain
pattered
hard
with
unfaltering
determination
on
the
roof
of
the
little
arbour
martin
lolled
over
the
rough
board
table
resting
his
chin
on
his
clasped
hands
looking
through
the
tinkling
bead
curtains
of
the
rain
towards
the
other
end
of
the
garden
where
under
a
canvas
shelter
the
cooks
were
moving
about
in
front
of
two
black
steaming
cauldrons
through
the
fresh
scent
of
leaves
came
a
greasy
smell
of
soup
he
was
thinking
of
the
jolly
that
must
have
drunk
and
danced
in
this
garden
before
the
war
of
the
lovers
who
must
have
sat
in
that
very
arbour
pressing
sunburned
cheek
against
sunburned
cheek
twining
hands
callous
with
work
in
the
fields
a
man
broke
suddenly
into
the
arbour
behind
martin
and
stood
flicking
the
water
off
his
uniform
with
his
cap
his
hair
was
wet
and
was
plastered
in
little
spikes
to
his
broad
forehead
a
forehead
that
was
the
entablature
of
a
determined
face
hello
said
martin
twisting
his
head
to
look
at
the
newcomer
you
section
yes
ever
read
in
wonderland
asked
the
wet
man
sitting
down
abruptly
at
the
table
yes
indeed
does
this
remind
you
of
it
what
this
war
business
why
i
keep
thinking
i
going
to
meet
the
rabbit
who
put
butter
in
his
watch
round
every
corner
it
was
the
best
butter
that
the
hell
of
it
when
your
section
leaving
here
asked
martin
picking
up
the
conversation
after
a
pause
during
which
they
both
stared
out
into
the
rain
they
could
hear
almost
constantly
the
grinding
roar
of
camions
on
the
road
behind
the
café
and
the
slither
of
their
wheels
through
the
where
the
road
turned
into
the
village
how
the
devil
should
i
know
somebody
had
dope
this
morning
that
we
leave
here
for
soissons
martin
words
tailed
off
into
a
convictionless
mumble
it
surely
is
different
than
you
pictured
it
is
it
now
they
sat
looking
at
each
other
while
the
big
drops
from
the
leaky
roof
smacked
on
the
table
or
splashed
cold
in
their
faces
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
anyway
said
the
wet
man
suddenly
lowering
his
voice
stealthily
i
do
know
i
never
did
expect
it
to
be
what
we
were
taught
to
believe
things
are
but
you
ca
have
guessed
that
it
was
like
this
like
alice
in
wonderland
like
an
drury
lane
pantomime
like
all
the
dusty
futility
of
barnum
and
bailey
circus
no
i
thought
it
would
be
said
martin
think
man
think
of
all
the
oceans
of
lies
through
all
the
ages
that
must
have
been
necessary
to
make
this
possible
think
of
this
new
particular
vintage
of
lies
that
has
been
so
industriously
pumped
out
of
the
press
and
the
pulpit
does
it
stagger
you
martin
nodded
why
lies
are
like
a
sticky
juice
overspreading
the
world
a
living
growing
flypaper
to
catch
and
gum
the
wings
of
every
human
soul
and
the
little
helpless
buzzings
of
honest
liberal
kindly
people
they
like
the
thin
little
noise
flies
make
when
they
caught
i
agree
with
you
that
the
little
thin
noise
is
very
silly
said
martin
martin
slammed
down
the
hood
of
the
car
and
stood
upright
a
cold
stream
of
rain
ran
down
the
sleeves
of
his
slicker
and
dripped
from
his
greasy
hands
infantry
tramped
by
the
rain
spattering
with
a
cold
glitter
on
grey
helmets
on
on
the
straps
of
equipment
red
sweating
faces
drooping
under
the
hard
rims
of
helmets
turned
to
the
ground
with
the
struggle
with
the
weight
of
equipment
rows
and
patches
of
faces
were
the
only
warmth
in
the
desolation
of
mud
and
bowed
bodies
and
dripping
sky
in
the
cold
colourlessness
they
were
delicate
and
feeble
as
the
faces
of
children
rosy
and
soft
under
the
splattering
of
mud
and
the
shagginess
of
unshaven
beards
martin
rubbed
the
back
of
his
hand
against
his
face
his
skin
was
like
that
too
soft
as
the
petals
of
flowers
soft
and
warm
amid
all
this
dead
mud
amid
all
this
hard
steel
he
leant
against
the
side
of
the
car
his
ears
full
of
the
heavy
shuffle
of
the
jingle
of
equipment
of
the
splashing
in
puddles
of
boots
and
watched
the
endless
rosy
patches
of
faces
moving
by
the
faces
that
drooped
towards
the
dripping
boots
that
rose
and
fell
churning
into
froth
the
soupy
mud
of
the
road
the
schoolmaster
garden
was
full
of
late
roses
and
marigolds
all
parched
and
bleached
by
the
thick
layer
of
dust
that
was
over
them
next
to
the
trellis
that
cut
the
garden
off
from
the
road
stood
a
green
table
and
a
few
cane
chairs
the
schoolmaster
something
charmingly
about
the
cut
of
his
breeches
and
the
calves
of
his
legs
in
their
thick
woollen
led
the
way
a
brown
pitcher
of
wine
in
his
hand
martin
howe
and
the
boy
from
new
orleans
who
was
his
followed
him
then
came
a
little
grey
woman
in
a
pink
knitted
shawl
carrying
a
tray
with
glasses
in
the
verdunois
our
wine
is
not
very
good
said
the
schoolmaster
bowing
them
into
chairs
it
is
thin
and
cold
like
the
climate
to
your
health
gentlemen
to
france
to
america
and
down
with
the
boches
in
the
pale
yellow
light
that
came
from
among
the
dark
clouds
that
passed
over
the
sky
the
wine
had
the
chilly
gleam
of
yellow
diamonds
ah
you
should
have
seen
that
road
in
said
the
schoolmaster
drawing
a
hand
over
his
watery
blue
eyes
that
you
know
is
the
voie
sacrée
the
sacred
way
that
saved
verdun
all
day
all
day
a
double
line
of
camions
went
up
full
of
ammunition
and
ravitaillement
and
men
oh
the
poor
boys
we
saw
so
many
go
up
came
the
voice
dry
as
the
rustling
of
the
wind
in
the
of
the
grey
old
woman
who
stood
leaning
against
the
schoolmaster
chair
looking
out
through
a
gap
in
the
trellis
at
the
rutted
road
so
thick
with
dust
and
never
have
we
seen
one
of
them
come
back
it
was
for
france
but
this
was
a
nice
village
before
the
war
from
verdun
to
the
courrier
des
postes
used
to
tell
us
there
was
no
such
village
so
clean
and
with
such
fine
orchards
the
old
woman
leaned
over
the
schoolmaster
shoulder
joining
eagerly
in
the
conversation
even
now
the
fruit
is
very
fine
said
martin
but
you
soldiers
you
steal
it
all
said
the
old
woman
throwing
out
her
arms
you
leave
us
nothing
nothing
we
do
begrudge
it
said
the
schoolmaster
all
we
have
is
our
country
we
shall
starve
then
as
she
spoke
the
glasses
on
the
table
shook
with
a
roar
of
heavy
wheels
and
a
grind
of
gears
a
camion
went
by
o
good
god
the
old
woman
looked
out
on
to
the
road
with
terror
in
her
face
blinking
her
eyes
in
the
thick
dust
roaring
with
heavy
wheels
grinding
with
gears
throbbing
with
motors
camion
after
camion
went
by
slowly
stridently
the
men
packed
into
the
camions
had
broken
through
the
canvas
covers
and
leaned
out
waving
their
arms
and
shouting
oh
the
poor
children
said
the
old
woman
wringing
her
hands
her
voice
lost
in
the
roar
and
the
shouting
they
should
not
destroy
property
that
way
said
the
schoolmaster
last
year
it
was
dreadful
there
were
mutinies
martin
sat
his
chair
tilted
back
his
hands
trembling
staring
with
compressed
lips
at
the
men
who
jolted
by
on
the
strident
throbbing
camions
a
word
formed
in
his
mind
tumbrils
in
some
trucks
the
men
were
drunk
and
singing
waving
their
bidons
in
the
air
shouting
at
people
along
the
road
crying
out
all
sorts
of
things
get
to
the
front
into
the
trenches
with
them
down
with
the
war
in
others
they
sat
quiet
faces
with
dust
through
the
gap
in
the
trellis
martin
stared
at
them
noting
intelligent
faces
beautiful
faces
faces
brutally
gay
miserable
faces
like
those
of
sobbing
drunkards
at
last
the
convoy
passed
and
the
dust
settled
again
on
the
rutted
road
oh
the
poor
children
said
the
old
woman
they
know
they
are
going
to
death
they
tried
to
hide
their
agitation
the
schoolmaster
poured
out
more
wine
yes
said
martin
there
are
fine
orchards
on
the
hills
round
here
you
should
be
here
when
the
plums
are
ripe
said
the
schoolmaster
a
tall
bearded
man
covered
with
dust
to
the
eyelashes
in
the
uniform
of
a
commandant
stepped
into
the
garden
my
dear
friends
he
shook
hands
with
the
schoolmaster
and
the
old
woman
and
saluted
the
two
americans
i
could
not
pass
without
stopping
a
moment
we
are
going
up
to
an
attack
we
have
the
honour
to
take
the
lead
you
will
have
a
glass
of
wine
wo
you
with
great
pleasure
julie
fetch
a
bottle
you
know
which
how
is
the
morale
perfect
i
thought
they
looked
a
little
discontented
no
it
always
like
that
they
were
yelling
at
some
gendarmes
if
they
strung
up
a
couple
it
would
serve
them
right
dirty
beasts
you
soldiers
are
all
one
against
the
gendarmes
yes
we
fight
the
enemy
but
we
hate
the
gendarmes
the
commandant
rubbed
his
hands
drank
his
wine
and
laughed
hah
there
the
next
convoy
i
must
go
good
luck
the
commandant
shrugged
his
shoulders
clicked
his
heels
together
at
the
garden
gate
saluted
smiling
and
was
gone
again
the
village
street
was
full
of
the
grinding
roar
and
throb
of
camions
full
of
a
frenzy
of
wheels
and
drunken
shouting
give
us
a
drink
you
we
the
train
de
luxe
we
are
down
with
the
war
and
the
old
grey
woman
wrung
her
hands
and
said
oh
the
poor
children
they
know
they
are
going
to
death
chapter
iv
martin
rolled
up
in
his
bedroll
on
the
floor
of
the
empty
hayloft
woke
with
a
start
say
howe
tom
randolph
who
lay
next
him
was
pressing
his
hand
i
think
i
heard
a
shell
go
over
as
he
spoke
there
came
a
shrill
loudening
whine
and
an
explosion
that
shook
the
barn
a
little
dirt
fell
down
on
martin
face
say
fellers
that
was
damn
near
came
a
voice
from
the
floor
of
the
barn
we
better
go
over
to
the
quarry
oh
hell
i
was
sound
asleep
a
vicious
shriek
overhead
and
a
shaking
snort
of
explosion
gee
that
was
in
the
house
behind
us
i
smell
gas
ye
damn
fool
it
carbide
one
of
the
frenchmen
said
it
was
gas
all
right
fellers
put
on
your
masks
outside
there
was
a
sickly
rough
smell
in
the
air
that
mingled
strangely
with
the
perfume
of
the
cool
night
musical
with
the
gurgling
of
the
stream
through
the
little
valley
where
their
barn
was
they
crouched
in
a
quarry
by
the
roadside
a
straggling
group
and
watched
the
flashes
in
the
sky
northward
where
artillery
along
the
lines
kept
up
a
continuous
hammering
drumbeat
over
their
heads
shells
shrieked
at
intervals
to
explode
with
a
rattling
ripping
sound
in
the
village
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
damn
foolishness
muttered
tom
randolph
in
his
rich
southern
voice
why
do
those
damn
gunners
go
to
sleep
and
let
us
go
to
sleep
they
must
be
tired
like
we
are
a
shell
burst
in
a
house
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
opposite
so
that
they
saw
the
flash
against
the
starry
night
sky
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
moaning
shriek
of
a
man
came
faintly
across
the
valley
martin
sat
on
the
steps
of
the
dugout
looking
up
the
shattered
shaft
of
a
tree
from
the
top
of
which
a
few
ribbons
of
bark
fluttered
against
the
mauve
evening
sky
in
the
quiet
he
could
hear
the
voices
of
men
chatting
in
the
dark
below
him
and
a
sound
of
someone
whistling
as
he
worked
now
and
then
like
some
ungainly
bird
a
high
calibre
shell
trundled
through
the
air
overhead
after
its
noise
had
completely
died
away
would
come
the
thud
of
the
explosion
it
was
like
battledore
and
shuttlecock
these
huge
masses
whirling
through
the
evening
far
above
his
head
now
from
one
side
now
from
the
other
it
gave
him
somehow
a
cosy
feeling
of
safety
as
if
he
were
under
some
sort
of
a
bridge
over
which
were
shunted
madly
to
and
fro
the
doctor
in
charge
of
the
post
came
up
and
sat
beside
martin
he
was
a
small
brown
man
with
slim
black
moustaches
that
curved
like
the
horns
of
a
steer
he
stood
on
on
the
top
step
and
peered
about
in
every
direction
with
an
air
of
ownership
then
sat
down
again
and
began
talking
briskly
we
are
exactly
four
hundred
and
five
mètres
from
the
boche
five
hundred
mètres
from
here
they
are
drinking
beer
and
saying
der
kaiser
about
as
much
as
we
saying
la
république
i
should
say
who
knows
but
it
is
quiet
here
is
it
it
quieter
here
than
in
paris
the
sky
is
very
beautiful
they
say
they
shelling
the
damned
embusqués
it
do
them
good
to
get
a
bit
of
their
own
medicine
martin
did
not
answer
he
was
crossing
in
his
mind
the
four
hundred
and
five
mètres
to
the
first
boche
next
beyond
the
abris
was
the
latrine
from
which
a
puff
of
wind
brought
now
and
then
a
nauseous
stench
then
there
was
the
tin
roof
crumpled
as
if
by
a
hand
that
had
been
a
cook
shack
that
was
just
behind
the
second
line
trenches
that
in
and
out
of
great
abscesses
of
wet
upturned
clay
along
the
crest
of
a
little
hill
the
other
day
he
had
been
there
and
had
clambered
up
the
oily
clay
where
the
boyau
had
caved
in
and
from
the
level
of
the
ground
had
looked
for
an
anxious
minute
or
two
at
the
tangle
of
trenches
and
pitted
gangrened
soil
in
the
direction
of
the
german
outposts
and
all
along
these
random
gashes
in
the
mucky
clay
were
men
feet
and
legs
huge
from
clotting
after
clotting
of
clay
men
with
faces
scarred
by
lines
of
strain
and
fear
and
boredom
as
the
hillside
was
scarred
out
of
all
semblance
by
the
trenches
and
the
we
are
well
off
here
said
the
doctor
again
i
have
not
had
a
serious
case
all
day
up
in
the
front
line
there
a
place
where
they
planted
rhubarb
you
know
where
the
hillside
is
beginning
to
get
rocky
it
was
the
boche
who
did
that
we
took
that
slope
from
them
two
months
ago
how
does
it
grow
they
say
the
gas
makes
the
leaves
shrivel
said
martin
laughing
he
looked
long
at
the
little
ranks
of
clouds
that
had
begun
to
fill
the
sky
like
ruffles
on
a
woman
dress
might
not
it
really
be
he
kept
asking
himself
that
the
sky
was
a
beneficent
goddess
who
would
stoop
gently
out
of
the
infinite
spaces
and
lift
him
to
her
breast
where
he
could
lie
amid
the
ruffles
of
cloud
and
look
curiously
down
at
the
spinning
ball
of
the
earth
it
might
have
beauty
if
he
were
far
enough
away
to
clear
his
nostrils
of
the
stench
of
pain
it
is
funny
said
the
little
doctor
suddenly
to
think
how
much
nearer
we
are
in
state
of
mind
in
everything
to
the
germans
than
to
anyone
else
you
mean
that
the
soldiers
in
the
trenches
are
all
further
from
the
people
at
home
than
from
each
other
no
matter
what
side
they
are
on
the
little
doctor
nodded
god
it
so
stupid
why
ca
we
go
over
and
talk
to
them
fighting
about
anything
god
it
so
hideously
stupid
cried
martin
suddenly
carried
away
helpless
in
the
flood
of
his
passionate
revolt
life
is
stupid
said
the
little
doctor
sententiously
suddenly
from
the
lines
came
a
splutter
of
evensong
cried
the
little
doctor
ah
but
here
business
better
get
your
car
ready
my
friend
the
brancardiers
set
the
stretcher
down
at
the
top
of
the
steps
that
led
to
the
door
of
the
dugout
so
that
martin
found
himself
looking
into
the
lean
sensitive
face
stained
a
little
with
blood
about
the
mouth
of
the
wounded
man
his
eyes
followed
along
the
shapeless
bundles
of
uniform
till
they
suddenly
turned
away
where
the
middle
of
the
man
had
been
where
had
been
the
curved
belly
and
the
genitals
where
the
thighs
had
joined
with
a
strong
swerving
of
muscles
to
the
trunk
was
a
depression
a
hollow
pool
of
blood
that
glinted
a
little
in
the
cold
diffusion
of
grey
light
from
the
west
the
rain
beat
hard
on
the
of
the
little
room
and
hissed
down
the
chimney
into
the
smouldering
fire
that
sent
up
thick
green
smoke
at
a
plain
oak
table
before
the
fireplace
sat
martin
howe
and
tom
randolph
tom
randolph
with
his
sunburned
hands
with
their
dirty
nails
spread
flat
and
his
head
resting
on
the
table
between
them
so
that
martin
could
see
the
stiff
black
hair
on
top
of
his
head
and
the
dark
nape
of
his
neck
going
into
shadow
under
the
collar
of
the
flannel
shirt
oh
god
it
too
damned
absurd
an
arrangement
for
mutual
suicide
and
no
damned
other
thing
said
randolph
raising
his
head
a
certain
jolly
asinine
grotesqueness
though
i
mean
if
you
were
god
and
could
look
at
it
like
that
oh
randy
why
do
they
enjoy
hatred
so
a
question
of
taste
as
the
lady
said
when
she
kissed
the
cow
but
it
is
it
is
natural
for
people
to
hate
that
way
it
be
it
even
disgusts
the
perfectly
stupid
people
like
higgins
who
believes
that
the
bible
was
written
in
god
own
handwriting
and
that
the
newspapers
tell
the
truth
it
makes
me
sick
at
ma
stomach
howe
to
talk
to
one
of
those
women
if
they
male
or
female
it
is
a
stupid
affair
as
the
doctor
at
said
yesterday
hell
yes
they
sat
silent
watching
the
rain
beat
on
the
window
and
run
down
in
sparkling
streams
what
i
ca
get
over
is
these
frenchwomen
randolph
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
they
so
bloody
frank
did
i
tell
you
about
what
happened
to
me
at
that
last
village
on
the
verdun
road
no
i
was
lyin
down
for
a
nap
under
a
a
wonderfully
nice
place
near
a
brook
an
all
an
suddenly
that
crazy
jane
you
know
the
one
that
used
to
throw
stones
at
us
out
of
that
house
at
the
corner
of
the
road
anyway
she
comes
up
to
me
with
a
funny
look
in
her
eyes
an
starts
makin
love
to
me
i
had
a
regular
wrastlin
match
gettin
away
from
her
funny
position
for
you
to
be
in
getting
away
from
a
woman
but
does
that
strike
you
funny
why
down
where
i
come
from
a
drunken
mulatto
woman
would
act
like
that
they
all
keep
up
a
fake
of
not
wantin
your
attentions
his
black
eyes
sparkled
and
he
laughed
his
deep
ringing
laugh
that
made
the
withered
woman
smile
as
she
set
an
omelette
before
them
voilà
messieurs
she
said
with
a
grand
air
as
if
it
were
a
head
that
she
was
serving
three
french
infantrymen
came
into
the
café
shaking
the
rain
off
their
shoulders
nothing
to
drink
but
champagne
at
four
francs
fifty
shouted
howe
dirty
night
out
is
it
we
drink
that
then
howe
and
randolph
moved
up
and
they
all
sat
at
the
same
table
fortune
of
war
oh
the
war
what
do
you
think
of
the
war
cried
martin
what
do
you
think
of
the
peste
you
think
about
saving
your
skin
what
amusing
about
us
is
that
we
three
have
all
saved
our
skins
together
said
one
of
the
frenchmen
yes
we
are
of
the
same
class
said
another
holding
up
his
thumb
mobilised
same
day
he
held
up
his
first
finger
same
company
he
held
up
a
second
finger
wounded
by
the
same
shell
evacuated
to
the
same
hospital
convalescence
at
same
time
réformé
to
the
same
depôt
behind
the
lines
did
all
marry
the
same
girl
did
you
to
make
it
complete
asked
randolph
they
all
shouted
with
laughter
until
the
glasses
along
the
bar
rang
you
must
be
athos
porthos
and
we
are
they
shouted
some
more
champagne
madame
for
the
three
musketeers
sang
randolph
in
a
sort
of
operatic
yodle
all
i
have
left
is
this
said
the
withered
woman
setting
a
bottle
down
on
the
table
is
that
poison
it
cognac
it
very
good
cognac
said
the
old
woman
seriously
du

shouted
plein

mon
cognac
fait
bon
fait

fait

down
with
the
war
who

the
withered
whining
voice
it
after
hours
last
week
i
was
fined
next
time
be
closed
up
the
night
was
black
when
martin
and
randolph
after
lengthy
and
elaborate
farewells
started
down
the
muddy
road
towards
the
hospital
they
staggered
along
the
slippery
footpath
beside
the
road
splashed
every
instant
with
mud
by
camions
huge
and
dark
that
roared
grindingly
by
they
ran
and
skipped
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
de
ma
blonde
fait
bon
fait
bon
fait
bon
auprès
de
ma
blonde
fait
bon
a
stench
of
sweat
and
filth
and
formaldehyde
caught
them
by
the
throat
as
they
went
into
the
hospital
tent
gave
them
a
sense
of
feverish
bodies
of
men
stretched
all
about
them
stirring
in
pain
a
car
for
la
bassée
ambulance
said
the
orderly
howe
got
himself
up
off
the
hospital
stretcher
shoving
his
flannel
shirt
back
into
his
breeches
put
on
his
coat
and
belt
and
felt
his
way
to
the
door
stumbling
over
the
legs
of
sleeping
brancardiers
as
he
went
men
swore
in
their
sleep
and
turned
over
heavily
at
the
door
he
waited
a
minute
then
shouted
coming
tom
too
damn
sleepy
came
randolph
voice
from
under
a
blanket
i
got
cigarettes
tom
i
smoke
all
up
if
you
do
come
all
right
i
come
less
noise
name
of
god
cried
a
man
sitting
up
on
his
stretcher
after
the
hospital
smelling
of
chloride
and
blankets
and
reeking
clothes
the
night
air
was
unbelievably
sweet
like
a
gilt
fringe
on
a
dark
shawl
a
little
band
of
brightness
had
appeared
in
the
east
some
dawn
howe
ai
it
as
they
were
going
off
their
motor
chugging
regularly
an
orderly
said
it
a
special
case
go
for
orders
to
the
commandant
colours
formed
gradually
out
of
chaotic
grey
as
the
day
brightened
at
the
an
attendant
ran
up
to
the
car
oh
you
for
the
special
case
have
you
anything
to
tie
a
man
with
no
why
it
nothing
he
just
tried
to
stab
the
the
attendant
raised
a
fist
and
tapped
on
his
head
as
if
knocking
on
a
door
it
nothing
he
quieter
now
what
caused
it
who
knows
there
is
so
much
he
says
he
must
kill
everyone
are
you
ready
a
lieutenant
of
the
medical
corps
came
to
the
door
and
looked
out
he
smiled
reassuringly
at
martin
howe
he
not
violent
any
more
and
we
send
two
guardians
a
sergeant
came
out
with
a
little
packet
which
he
handed
to
martin
that
his
will
you
give
it
to
them
at
the
hospital
at
fourreaux
and
here
his
knife
they
can
give
it
back
to
him
when
he
gets
better
he
has
an
idea
he
ought
to
kill
everyone
he
sees
funny
idea
the
sun
had
risen
and
shone
gold
across
the
broad
rolling
lands
so
that
the
hedges
and
the
cast
long
blue
shadows
over
the
fields
the
man
with
a
guardian
on
either
side
of
him
who
cast
nervous
glances
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
came
placidly
eyes
straight
in
front
of
him
out
of
the
dark
interior
of
the
he
was
a
small
man
with
moustaches
and
small
lips
puffed
into
an
at
the
car
he
turned
and
saluted
my
lieutenant
thank
you
for
your
kindness
he
said
old
chap
said
the
lieutenant
the
little
man
stood
up
in
the
car
looking
about
him
anxiously
i
lost
my
knife
where
my
knife
the
guards
got
in
behind
him
with
a
nervous
sheepish
air
they
answered
reassuringly
the
driver
got
it
the
american
got
it
good
the
orderly
jumped
on
the
seat
with
the
two
americans
to
show
the
way
he
whispered
in
martin
ear
he
crazy
he
says
that
to
stop
the
war
you
must
kill
everybody
kill
everybody
in
an
open
valley
that
sloped
between
hills
covered
with
stood
the
tall
abbey
a
gothic
nave
and
apse
with
beautifully
traced
windows
with
the
ruin
of
a
very
ancient
chapel
on
one
side
and
crossing
the
back
a
renaissance
building
that
had
been
a
dormitory
the
first
time
that
martin
saw
the
abbey
it
towered
in
ghostly
perfection
above
a
low
veil
of
mist
that
made
the
valley
seem
a
lake
in
the
shining
moonlight
the
lines
were
perfectly
quiet
and
when
he
stopped
the
motor
of
his
ambulance
he
could
hear
the
wind
rustling
among
the
except
for
the
dirty
smell
of
huddled
soldiers
that
came
now
and
then
in
drifts
along
with
the
cool
there
might
have
been
no
war
at
all
in
the
soft
moonlight
the
great
traceried
windows
and
the
buttresses
and
the
roof
seemed
as
gorgeously
untroubled
by
decay
as
if
the
carvings
on
the
cusps
and
arches
had
just
come
from
under
the
careful
chisels
of
the
gothic
workmen
and
you
say
we
progressed
he
whispered
to
tom
randolph
god
it
is
fine
they
wandered
up
and
down
the
road
a
long
time
silently
looking
at
the
tall
apse
of
the
abbey
breathing
the
cool
night
air
moist
with
mist
in
which
now
and
then
was
the
huddled
troubling
smell
of
soldiers
at
last
the
moon
huge
and
swollen
with
gold
set
behind
the
wooded
hills
and
they
went
back
to
the
car
where
they
rolled
up
in
their
blankets
and
went
to
sleep
behind
the
square
lantern
that
rose
over
the
crossing
there
was
a
trap
door
in
the
broken
tile
roof
from
which
you
could
climb
to
the
observation
post
in
the
lantern
here
half
on
the
roof
and
half
on
the
platform
behind
the
martin
would
spend
the
long
summer
afternoons
when
there
was
no
call
for
the
ambulance
looking
at
the
gothic
windows
of
the
lantern
and
the
blue
sky
beyond
where
huge
soft
clouds
passed
slowly
over
darkening
the
green
of
the
woods
and
of
the
fields
of
the
valley
with
their
moving
shadows
there
was
almost
no
activity
on
that
part
of
the
front
a
couple
of
times
a
day
a
few
snapping
discharges
would
come
from
the
of
the
battery
behind
the
abbey
and
the
woods
would
resound
like
a
shaken
harp
as
the
shells
passed
over
to
explode
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
that
blocked
the
end
of
the
valley
where
the
boches
were
martin
would
sit
and
dream
of
the
quiet
lives
the
monks
must
have
passed
in
their
beautiful
abbey
so
far
away
in
the
forest
of
the
argonne
digging
and
planting
in
the
rich
lands
of
the
valley
making
flowers
bloom
in
the
garden
of
which
traces
remained
in
the
huge
beds
of
sunflowers
and
orange
marigolds
that
bloomed
along
the
walls
of
the
dormitory
in
a
room
in
the
top
of
the
house
he
had
found
a
few
torn
remnants
of
books
there
must
have
been
a
library
in
the
old
days
rows
and
rows
of
volumes
in
rich
brown
calf
worn
by
use
to
a
velvet
softness
and
in
parchment
where
the
of
generations
showed
brown
huge
psalters
with
notes
and
chants
illuminated
in
green
and
ultramarine
and
gold
manuscripts
out
of
the
middle
ages
with
strange
script
and
pictures
in
pure
vivid
colours
lives
of
saints
thoughts
polished
by
years
of
quiet
meditation
of
old
divines
old
romances
of
chivalry
tales
of
blood
and
death
and
love
where
the
crude
agony
of
life
was
seen
through
a
mist
of
gentle
beauty
god
if
there
were
somewhere
nowadays
where
you
could
flee
from
all
this
stupidity
from
all
this
cant
of
governments
and
this
hideous
reiteration
of
hatred
this
strangling
hatred
he
would
say
to
himself
and
see
himself
working
in
the
fields
copying
parchments
in
quaint
letterings
drowsing
his
feverish
desires
to
calm
in
the
passionate
chanting
of
the
endless
offices
of
the
church
one
afternoon
towards
evening
as
he
lay
on
the
tiled
roof
with
his
shirt
open
so
that
the
sun
warmed
his
throat
and
chest
half
asleep
in
the
beauty
of
the
building
and
of
the
woods
and
the
clouds
that
drifted
overhead
he
heard
a
strain
from
the
organ
in
the
church
a
few
deep
notes
in
broken
rhythm
that
filled
him
with
wonder
as
if
he
had
suddenly
been
transported
back
to
the
quiet
days
of
the
monks
the
rhythm
changed
in
an
instant
and
through
the
squeakiness
of
shattered
pipes
came
a
swirl
of
ragtime
that
resounded
like
mocking
laughter
in
the
old
vaults
and
arches
he
went
down
into
the
church
and
found
tom
randolph
playing
on
the
little
organ
pumping
desperately
with
his
feet
hello
impiety
i
call
it
putting
your
lustful
tunes
into
that
pious
old
organ
i
bet
the
ole
monks
had
a
merry
time
lecherous
ole
devils
said
tom
playing
away
if
there
were
monasteries
nowadays
said
martin
i
think
i
go
into
one
but
there
are
i
end
up
in
one
most
like
if
they
do
put
me
in
jail
first
i
reckon
every
living
soul
would
be
a
candidate
for
either
one
if
it
get
them
out
of
this
war
there
was
a
shriek
overhead
that
reverberated
strangely
in
the
vaults
of
the
church
and
made
the
swallows
nesting
there
fly
in
and
out
through
the
glassless
windows
tom
randolph
stopped
on
a
wild
chord
guess
they
do
like
me
playin
that
one
did
explode
though
that
one
did
by
gorry
said
randolph
getting
up
off
the
floor
where
he
had
thrown
himself
automatically
a
shower
of
tiles
came
rattling
off
the
roof
and
through
the
noise
could
be
heard
the
frightened
squeaking
of
the
swallows
i
am
afraid
that
winged
somebody
they
must
have
got
wind
of
the
ammunition
dump
in
the
cellar
hell
of
a
place
to
put
a
over
an
ammunition
dump
the
whitewashed
room
used
as
a
had
a
smell
of
blood
stronger
than
the
chloride
a
doctor
was
leaning
over
a
stretcher
on
which
martin
caught
a
glimpse
of
two
naked
legs
with
flecks
of
blood
on
the
white
skin
as
he
passed
through
on
his
way
to
the
car
three
for
les
islettes
very
softly
said
the
attendant
handing
him
the
papers
jolting
over
the
road
the
car
wound
slowly
through
unploughed
fields
at
every
jolt
came
a
rasping
groan
from
the
wounded
men
as
they
came
back
towards
the
front
posts
again
they
found
all
the
batteries
along
the
road
firing
the
air
was
a
chaos
of
explosions
that
jabbed
viciously
into
their
ears
above
the
reassuring
purr
of
the
motor
nearly
to
the
abbey
a
soldier
stopped
them
put
the
car
behind
the
trees
and
get
into
a
dugout
they
shelling
the
abbey
as
he
spoke
a
whining
shriek
grew
suddenly
loud
over
their
heads
the
soldier
threw
himself
flat
in
the
muddy
road
the
explosion
brought
gravel
about
their
ears
and
made
a
curious
smell
of
almonds
crowded
in
the
door
of
the
dugout
in
the
hill
opposite
they
watched
the
abbey
as
shell
after
shell
tore
through
the
roof
or
exploded
in
the
strong
buttresses
of
the
apse
dust
rose
high
above
the
roof
and
filled
the
air
with
an
odour
of
damp
tiles
and
plaster
the
woods
resounded
in
a
jangling
tremor
with
the
batteries
that
started
firing
one
after
the
other
god
i
hate
them
for
that
said
randolph
between
his
teeth
what
do
you
want
it
an
observation
post
i
know
but
damn
it
there
was
a
series
of
explosions
a
shell
fragment
whizzed
past
their
heads
it
not
safe
there
you
better
come
in
all
the
way
someone
shouted
from
within
the
dugout
i
want
to
see
damn
it
i
goin
to
stay
and
see
it
out
howe
that
place
meant
a
hell
of
a
lot
to
me
randolph
blushed
as
he
spoke
another
bunch
of
shells
crashing
so
near
together
they
did
not
hear
the
scream
when
the
cloud
of
dust
blew
away
they
saw
that
the
lantern
had
fallen
in
on
the
roof
of
the
apse
leaving
only
one
wall
and
the
tracery
of
a
window
of
which
the
shattered
carving
stood
out
against
the
reddish
evening
sky
there
was
a
lull
in
the
firing
a
few
swallows
still
wheeled
about
the
walls
giving
shrill
little
cries
they
saw
the
flash
of
a
shell
against
the
sky
as
it
exploded
in
the
part
of
the
tall
roof
that
still
remained
the
roof
crumpled
and
fell
in
and
again
dust
hid
the
abbey
oh
i
hate
this
said
tom
randolph
but
the
question
is
happened
to
our
grub
the
popote
is
buried
four
feet
deep
in
gothic
art
damn
fool
idea
putting
a
over
an
ammunition
dump
is
the
car
hit
the
orderly
came
up
to
them
do
think
so
good
four
for
at
once
at
night
in
a
dugout
five
men
playing
cards
about
a
that
blows
from
one
side
to
the
other
in
the
gusty
wind
that
puffs
every
now
and
then
down
the
mouth
of
the
dugout
and
whirls
round
it
like
something
alive
trying
to
beat
a
way
out
each
time
the
lamp
blows
the
shadows
of
the
five
heads
writhe
upon
the
corrugated
tin
ceiling
in
the
distance
like
beaten
for
a
dance
a
constant
reverberation
of
guns
martin
howe
stretched
out
in
the
straw
of
one
of
the
bunks
watches
their
faces
in
the
flickering
shadows
he
wishes
he
had
the
patience
to
play
too
no
perhaps
it
is
better
to
look
on
it
would
be
so
silly
to
be
killed
in
the
middle
of
one
of
those
grand
gestures
one
makes
in
slamming
the
card
down
that
takes
the
trick
suddenly
he
thinks
of
all
the
lives
that
must
in
these
last
three
years
have
ended
in
that
grand
gesture
it
is
too
silly
he
seems
to
see
their
poor
lacerated
souls
clutching
their
greasy
cards
climb
to
a
squalid
valhalla
and
there
in
rooms
like
those
of
the
little
cafés
behind
the
lines
sit
in
groups
of
five
shuffling
dealing
taking
tricks
always
with
the
same
slam
of
the
cards
on
the
table
pausing
now
and
then
to
scratch
their
flesh
at
this
moment
how
many
men
in
all
the
long
golgotha
that
stretches
from
belfort
to
the
sea
must
be
trying
to
cheat
their
boredom
and
their
misery
with
that
grand
gesture
of
slamming
the
cards
down
to
take
a
trick
while
in
their
ears
like
pounds
the
of
the
guns
martin
lies
on
his
back
looking
up
at
the
curved
corrugated
ceiling
of
the
dugout
where
the
shadows
of
the
five
heads
writhe
in
fantastic
shapes
is
it
death
they
are
playing
that
they
are
so
merry
when
they
take
a
trick
chapter
v
the
three
planes
gleamed
like
mica
in
the
intense
blue
of
the
sky
round
about
the
shrapnel
burst
in
little
puffs
like
a
shout
went
up
from
the
soldiers
who
stood
in
groups
in
the
street
of
the
ruined
town
a
whistle
split
the
air
followed
by
a
rending
snort
that
tailed
off
into
the
moaning
of
a
wounded
man
by
damn
they
nervy
they
dropped
a
bomb
i
should
say
they
did
the
dirty
bastards
to
get
a
fellow
who
going
on
permission
now
if
they
beaded
you
on
the
way
back
you
would
care
in
the
sky
an
escadrille
of
french
planes
had
appeared
and
the
three
german
specks
had
vanished
followed
by
a
trail
of
little
puffs
of
shrapnel
the
indigo
dome
of
the
afternoon
sky
was
full
of
a
distant
snoring
of
motors
the
train
screamed
outside
the
station
and
the
permissionaires
ran
for
the
platform
their
packed
musettes
bouncing
at
their
hips
the
dark
boulevards
with
here
and
there
a
blue
lamp
lighting
up
a
bench
and
a
few
or
a
faint
glow
from
inside
a
closed
café
where
a
boy
in
is
sweeping
the
floor
crowds
of
soldiers
belgians
americans
canadians
civilians
with
canes
and
straw
hats
and
women
on
their
arms
in
twos
and
threes
laughing
with
shrill
merry
voices
and
everywhere
girls
of
the
street
giggling
alluringly
in
hoarse
dissipated
tones
clutching
the
arms
of
drunken
soldiers
tilting
themselves
temptingly
in
men
way
as
they
walk
along
cigarettes
and
cigars
make
spots
of
reddish
light
and
now
and
then
a
match
lighted
makes
a
man
face
stand
out
in
yellow
relief
and
glints
red
in
the
eyes
of
people
round
about
drunk
with
their
freedom
with
the
jangle
of
voices
with
the
rustle
of
trees
in
the
faint
light
with
the
scents
of
women
hair
and
cheap
perfumes
howe
and
randolph
stroll
along
slowly
down
one
side
to
the
shadowy
columns
of
the
madeleine
where
a
few
still
offer
roses
scenting
the
darkness
then
back
again
past
the
opéra
towards
the
porte
martin
lingering
to
look
in
the
offered
faces
of
women
to
listen
to
snatches
of
talk
to
chatter
laughingly
with
girls
who
squeeze
their
arms
with
impatience
i
goin
to
find
the
prettiest
girl
in

and
then
you
see
the
dust
fly

on

circular
stand

of

to
think
that
down

knew
how
to
live
but
oh
boy
said
tom
randolph
breaking
a
little
loaf
of
bread
that
made
a
merry
crackling
sound
it
worth
starving
to
death
on
singe
and
pinard
for
four
months
after
the
hors
had
been
taken
away
leaving
them
rabelaisianly
gay
with
a
joyous
sense
of
orgy

in

with

plenty

their
round
table
with
its
white
cloth
and
its
bottles
of
wine
and
its
piles
of
ravished
artichoke
leaves
was
the
centre
of
a
noisy
fantastic
world
ever
since
the
orgy
of
the
hors
things
had
been
evolving
to
grotesqueness
faces
whites
of
eyes
twisted
red
of
lips
forms
of
waiters
colours
of
hats
and
uniforms
all
involved
and
jumbled
in
the
mélee
of
talk
and
clink
and
clatter
the
red
hand
of
the
waiter
pouring
the
chartreuse
green
like
a
stormy
sunset
into
small
glasses
before
them
broke
into
the
vivid
imaginings
that
had
been
unfolding
in
their
talk
through
dinner
no
they
had
been
saying
it
could
not
go
on
some
day
amid
the
rending
crash
of
shells
and
the
whine
of
shrapnel
fragments
people
everywhere
in
all
uniforms
in
trenches
packed
in
camions
in
stretchers
in
hospitals
crowded
behind
guns
involved
in
telephone
apparatus
generals
at
their
colonels
sipping
liqueurs
majors
developing
photographs
would
jump
to
their
feet
and
burst
out
laughing
at
the
solemn
inanity
at
the
stupid
vicious
pomposity
of
what
they
were
doing
laughter
would
untune
the
sky
it
would
be
a
new
progress
of
bacchus
drunk
with
laughter
at
the
sudden
vision
of
the
silliness
of
the
world
officers
and
soldiers
prisoners
working
on
the
roads
deserters
being
driven
towards
the
trenches
would
throw
down
their
guns
and
their
spades
and
their
heavy
packs
and
start
marching
or
driving
in
artillery
waggons
or
in
camions
staff
cars
private
trains
towards
their
capitals
where
they
would
laugh
the
deputies
the
senators
the
congressmen
the
out
of
their
chairs
laugh
the
presidents
and
the
prime
ministers
and
kaisers
and
dictators
out
of
their
offices
the
sun
would
wear
a
broad
grin
and
would
whisper
the
joke
to
the
moon
who
would
giggle
and
ripple
with
it
all
night
long
the
red
hand
of
the
waiter
with
thick
nails
and
knuckles
poured
chartreuse
into
the
small
glasses

of

lips

they
invited
him
over
to
their
table

eyes
and
a
thickness
to
his
voice
that
denoted
alcohol

their
heads
close
together

englishman

bit
o

they
tumbled
into
the
seats
round
a
table
at
an
american
bar
the
englishman
felt
in
his
pocket
oh

cried

a
ticket
to
the
theatre

a
box
we
can
all

in
come
along
let
hurry
they
walked
a
long
while
blundering
through
the
dark
streets
and
at
last
stopped
at
a
door
here
it
is
push
in
but
there
are
two
gentlemen
and
a
lady
already
in
the
box
meester
no

the
englishman
waved
the
ticket
in
the
air
the
little
round
man
with
a
round
red
face
who
was
taking
the
tickets
stuttered
in
bad
english
and
then
dropped
into
french
meanwhile
the
whole
party
had
filed
in
leaving
the
englishman
who
kept
waving
the
ticket
in
the
little
man
face
two
gendarmes
the
theatre
guards
came
up
menacingly
the
face
wreathed
itself
in
smiles
he
linked
an
arm
in
each
of
the
gendarmes
and
pushed
them
towards
the
bar
come
drink
to
the
entente
cordiale
vive
la
france
in
the
box
were
two
australians
and
a
woman
who
leaned
her
head
on
the
chest
of
one
and
then
the
other
alternately
laughing
so
that
you
could
see
the
gold
caps
in
her
black
teeth
they
were
annoyed
at
the
intrusion
that
packed
the
box
insupportably
tight
so
that
the
woman
had
to
sit
on
the
men
laps
but
the
air
soon
cleared
in
laughter
that
caused
people
in
the
orchestra
to
stare
angrily
at
the
box
full
of
noisy
men
in
khaki
at
last
the
englishman
came
squeezing
himself
in
with
a
finger
mysteriously
on
his
lips
he
plucked
at
martin
arm
a
serious
set
look
coming
suddenly
over
his
grey
eyes
it
was
like
this
his
breath
laden
with
whisky
was
like
a
halo
round
martin
head
the
hun
was
a
nice
little
chap
could
been
more
than
eighteen
had
a
shoulder
broken
and
he
thought
that
my
pal
was
fixing
the
pillow
he
said
you
with
a
funny
german
accent
mind
you
he
said
you
that
what
hurt
and
the
man
laughed
god
damn
him
he
laughed
when
the
poor
devil
said
you
and
the
grenade
blew
him
to
hell
the
stage
was
a
glare
of
light
in
martin
eyes
he
felt
as
he
had
when
at
home
he
had
leaned
over
and
looked
straight
into
the
headlight
of
an
auto
drawn
up
to
the
side
of
the
road
screening
him
from
the
glare
were
the
backs
of
people
heads
tom
randolph
head
and
his
girl
side
by
side
their
cheeks
touching
the
pointed
red
chin
of
one
of
the
australians
and
the
frizzy
hair
of
the
other
woman
in
the
they
all
stood
at
the
bar
where
it
was
very
hot
and
an
orchestra
was
playing
and
there
were
many
men
in
khaki
in
all
stages
of
drunkenness
being
led
about
by
women
who
threw
jokes
at
each
other
behind
the
men
backs
here
to
mud
said
one
of
the
australians
the
war
end
when
everybody
is
drowned
in
mud
the
orchestra
began
playing
the
and
everyone
roared
out
the
marching
song
that
worn
threadbare
as
it
was
still
had
a
roistering
verve
to
it
that
caught
people
blood
people
had
gone
back
for
the
last
act
the
two
australians
the
englishman
and
the
two
americans
still
stood
talking
mind
you
i
not
what
you
call
susceptible
i
not
soft
i
got
over
all
that
long
ago
the
englishman
was
addressing
the
company
in
general
but
the
poor
beggar
said
you
what
he
saying
asked
a
woman
plucking
at
martin
arm
he
telling
about
a
german
atrocity
oh
the
dirty
germans
what
things
they
done
the
woman
answered
mechanically
somehow
during
the
the
australians
had
collected
another
woman
and
a
strange
fat
woman
with
lips
painted
very
small
and
very
large
bulging
eyes
had
attached
herself
to
martin
he
suffered
her
because
every
time
he
looked
at
her
she
burst
out
laughing
the
bar
was
closing
they
had
a
drink
of
champagne
all
round
that
made
the
fat
woman
give
little
shrieks
of
delight
they
drifted
towards
the
door
and
stood
a
formless
irresolute
group
in
the
dark
street
in
front
of
the
theatre
randolph
came
up
to
martin
look
we
goin
i
wonder
if
i
ought
to
leave
my
money
with
you
i
doubt
if

safe
person

tom
randolph
pressed
martin
hand
and
was
off
there
was
a
sound
of
a
kiss
in
the
darkness
i
say
i
got
to
have
something
to
eat
said
the
englishman
i
did
have
a
bit
of
dinner
i
say
mangai
mangai
he
made
gestures
of
putting
things
into
his
mouth
in
the
direction
of
the
fat
woman
the
three
women
put
their
heads
together
one
of
them
knew
a
place
but
it
was
a
dreadful
place
really
they
must
think
that
she
only
knew
it
because
when
she
was
very
young
a
man
had
taken
her
there
who
wanted
to
seduce
her
at
that
everyone
laughed
and
the
voices
of
the
women
rose
shrill
all
right
do
talk
let
go
there
said
one
of
the
australians
we
attend
to
the
seducing
a
thick
woman
a
tall
comb
in
the
back
of
her
black
hair
and
an
immovable
face
with
jaw
muscled
like
a
served
them
with
cold
chicken
and
ham
and
champagne
in
a
room
with
mouldering
greenish
lighted
by
a
lamp
the
australians
ate
and
sang
and
made
love
to
their
women
the
englishman
went
to
sleep
with
his
head
on
the
table
martin
leaned
back
out
of
the
circle
of
light
keeping
up
a
desultory
conversation
with
the
woman
beside
him
listening
to
the
sounds
of
the
men
voices
down
corridors
of
the
front
door
being
opened
and
slammed
again
and
again
and
of
forced
shrill
giggles
of
women
unfortunately
i
have
an
engagement
said
martin
to
the
woman
beside
him
whose
large
spherical
breasts
heaved
as
she
talked
and
who
rolled
herself
nearer
to
him
invitingly
seeming
with
her
round
and
her
round
cheeks
to
be
made
up
entirely
of
small
spheres
and
large
soft
ones
oh
but
it
is
too
late
you
can
break
it
it
at
four
then
we
have
time
ducky
it
something
really
romantic
you
see
the
young
are
always
lucky
she
rolled
her
eyes
in
sympathetic
admiration
this
will
be
the
fourth
night
this
week
that
i
have
not
made
a
sou
i
chuck
myself
into
the
river
soon
martin
felt
himself
softening
towards
her
he
slipped
a
note
in
her
hand
oh
you
are
too
good
you
are
really
galant
homme
you
martin
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
dreaming
of
the
woman
he
would
like
to
love
she
should
be
very
dark
with
red
lips
and
stained
cheeks
like
randolph
girl
she
should
have
small
breasts
and
slender
dark
dancer
thighs
and
in
her
arms
he
could
forget
everything
but
the
madness
and
the
mystery
and
the
intricate
life
of
paris
about
them
he
thought
of
montmartre
and
louise
in
the
opera
standing
at
her
window
singing
the
madness
of
paris
one
of
the
australians
had
gone
away
with
a
little
woman
in
a
pink
negligée
the
other
australian
and
the
englishman
were
standing
unsteadily
near
the
table
each
supported
by
a
girl
leaving
the
fat
woman
sadly
finishing
the
remains
of
the
chicken
large
tears
rolling
from
her
eyes
they
left
the
house
and
walked
for
a
long
time
down
dark
streets
three
men
and
two
women
the
englishman
being
supported
in
the
middle
singing
in
a
desultory
fashion
they
stopped
under
a
broken
sign
of
black
letters
on
greyish
glass
within
which
one
feeble
electric
light
bulb
made
a
red
glow
the
pavement
was
wet
and
glimmered
where
it
slanted
up
to
the
at
the
next
corner
here
we
are
come
along
janey
cried
the
australian
in
a
brisk
voice
the
door
opened
and
slammed
again
martin
and
the
other
girl
stood
on
the
pavement
facing
each
other
the
englishman
collapsed
on
the
doorstep
and
began
to
snore
well
there
only
you
and
me
she
said
oh
if
you
were
only
a
person
instead
of
being
a
member
of
a
profession
said
martin
softly
come
she
said
no
dearie
i
must
go
said
martin
as
you
will
i
take
care
of
your
friend
she
yawned
he
kissed
her
and
strode
down
the
dark
street
his
nostrils
full
of
the
smell
of
the
rouge
on
her
lips
he
walked
a
long
while
with
his
hat
off
breathing
deep
of
the
sharp
night
air
the
streets
were
black
and
silent
intemperate
desires
prowled
like
cats
in
the
darkness
he
woke
up
and
stretched
himself
stiffly
smelling
grass
and
damp
earth
a
pearly
lavender
mist
was
all
about
him
through
which
loomed
the
square
towers
of
notre
dame
and
the
row
of
kings
across
the
façade
and
the
sculpture
about
the
darkness
of
the
doorways
he
had
lain
down
on
his
back
on
the
little
grass
plot
of
the
parvis
notre
dame
to
look
at
the
stars
and
had
fallen
asleep
it
must
be
nearly
dawn
words
were
droning
importunately
in
his
head
the
poor
beggar
said
you
with
a
funny
german
accent
and
the
grenade
blew
him
to
hell
he
remembered
the
man
he
had
once
helped
to
pick
up
in
whose
pocket
a
grenade
had
exploded
before
that
he
had
not
realised
that
torn
flesh
was
such
a
like
sausage
meat
get
up
you
ca
lie
there
cried
a
gendarme
notre
dame
is
beautiful
in
the
morning
said
martin
stepping
across
the
low
rail
on
to
the
pavement
ah
yes
it
is
beautiful
martin
howe
sat
on
the
rail
of
the
bridge
and
looked
before
him
with
nothing
distinct
yet
to
be
seen
were
two
square
towers
and
the
tracery
between
them
and
the
row
of
kings
on
the
façade
and
the
long
series
of
flying
buttresses
of
the
flank
gleaming
through
the
mist
and
barely
visible
the
dark
slender
spire
soaring
above
the
crossing
so
had
the
abbey
in
the
forest
gleamed
tall
in
the
misty
moonlight
like
mist
only
drab
and
dense
the
dust
had
risen
above
the
tall
apse
as
the
shells
tore
it
to
pieces
amid
a
smell
of
coffee
he
sat
at
a
table
and
watched
people
pass
briskly
through
the
ruddy
sunlight
waiters
in
were
rubbing
off
the
other
tables
and
putting
out
the
chairs
he
sat
sipping
coffee
feeling
languid
and
nerveless
after
a
while
tom
randolph
looking
very
young
and
brown
with
his
hat
a
little
on
one
side
came
along
with
him
plainly
dressed
in
blue
serge
was
the
girl
they
sat
down
and
she
dropped
her
head
on
his
shoulder
covering
her
eyes
with
her
dark
lashes
oh
i
am
so
tired
poor
child
you
must
go
home
and
go
back
to
bed
but
i
got
to
go
to
work
poor
thing
they
kissed
each
other
tenderly
and
languidly
the
waiter
came
with
coffee
and
hot
milk
and
little
crisp
loaves
of
bread
oh
paris
is
wonderful
in
the
early
morning
said
martin
indeed
it
is
little
girl
if
you
must
go
we
see
each
other
again
you
must
call
me
yvonne
she
pouted
a
little
all
right
yvonne
he
got
to
his
feet
and
pressed
her
two
hands
well
what
sort
of
a
time
did
you
have
howe
curious
i
lost
our
friends
one
by
one
left
two
women
and
slept
a
little
while
on
the
grass
in
front
of
notre
dame
that
was
my
real
love
of
the
night
my
girl
was
charming
honestly
i
marry
her
in
a
minute
he
laughed
a
merry
laugh
let
take
a
cab
somewhere
they
climbed
into
a
victoria
and
told
the
driver
to
go
to
the
madeleine
look
before
i
do
anything
else
i
must
go
to
the
hotel
why
preventives
of
course
you
better
go
at
once
the
cab
rattled
merrily
along
the
streets
where
the
early
sunshine
cast
rusty
patches
on
the
grey
houses
and
on
the
thronged
fantastic
that
rose
in
clusters
and
hedges
from
the
mansard
roofs
chapter
vi
the
lamp
in
the
hut
of
the
road
control
casts
an
oblong
of
light
on
the
white
wall
opposite
the
patch
of
light
is
constantly
crossed
and
scalloped
and
obscured
by
shadows
of
rifles
and
helmets
and
packs
of
men
passing
now
and
then
the
shadow
of
a
single
man
a
nose
and
a
chin
under
a
helmet
a
head
bent
forward
with
the
weight
of
the
pack
or
a
pack
alone
beside
which
slants
a
rifle
shows
up
huge
and
fantastic
with
its
loaf
of
bread
and
its
pair
of
shoes
and
its
pots
and
pans
then
with
a
jingle
of
harness
and
clank
of

train
after
train
of
artillery
comes
up
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
road
is
thrown
by
the
lamp
into
vivid
relief
and
is
swallowed
again
by
the
blackness
of
the
village
street
short
bodies
of
sticking
like
ducks
tails
from
between
their
large
wheels
caisson
after
caisson
of
ammunition
huge
waggons
hooded
and
unhooded
filled
with
a
chaos
of
equipment
that
catches
fantastic
lights
and
throws
huge
muddled
shadows
on
the
white
wall
of
the
house
put
that
light
out
name
of
god
do
you
want
to
have
them
start
chucking
shells
into
here
comes
a
voice
shrill
with
anger
the
brisk
trot
of
the
officer
horse
is
lost
in
the
clangour
the
door
of
the
hut
slams
to
and
only
a
thin
ray
of
orange
light
penetrates
into
the
blackness
of
the
road
where
with
jingle
of
harness
and
clatter
of
iron
and
tramp
of
hoofs
gun
after
gun
caisson
after
caisson
waggon
after
waggon
files
by
now
and
then
the
passing
stops
entirely
and
matches
flare
where
men
light
pipes
and
cigarettes
coming
from
the
other
direction
with
throbbing
of
motors
a
convoy
of
camions
huge
black
oblongs
grinds
down
the
other
side
of
the
road
horses
rear
and
there
are
shouts
and
curses
and
clacking
of
reins
in
the
darkness
far
away
where
the
lowering
clouds
meet
the
hills
beyond
the
village
a
white
glare
grows
and
fades
again
at
intervals
there
a
most
tremendous
concentration
of
sanitary
sections
you
bet
two
american
sections
and
a
french
one
in
this
village
three
more
down
the
road
something
up
there
goin
to
be
an
attack
at
mihiel
a
frenchman
told
me
i
heard
that
the
germans
were
concentrating
for
an
offensive
in
the
four
de
paris
damned
unlikely
anyway

the
third
week

in
this
bloody
hole
with
our
feet
in
the
mud
they
got
us
quartered
in
a
barn
with
a
regular
brook
flowing
through
the
middle
of
it
the
main
thing
about
this
damned
war
is
ennui
just
plain
boredom
not
forgetting
the
mud
three
ambulance
drivers
in
slickers
were
on
the
front
seat
of
a
car
the
rain
fell
in
perpendicular
sheets
pattering
on
the
roof
of
the
car
and
on
the
puddles
that
filled
the
village
street
streaming
with
water
blackened
walls
of
ruined
houses
rose
opposite
them
above
a
rank
growth
of
weeds
beyond
were
hills
every
little
while
slithering
through
the
rain
splashing
mud
to
the
right
and
left
a
convoy
of
camions
went
by
and
disappeared
truck
after
truck
in
the
white
streaming
rain
inside
the
car
tom
randolph
was
playing
an
accordion
letting
strange
nostalgic
little
songs
filter
out
amid
the
hard
patter
of
the
rain
i
been
workin
on
de
railroad
all
de
livelong
day
i
been
workin
on
de
railroad
jus
to
pass
de
time
the
men
on
the
front
seat
leaned
back
and
shook
the
water
off
their
knees
and
hummed
the
song
the
accordion
had
stopped
tom
randolph
was
lying
on
his
back
on
the
floor
of
the
car
with
his
arm
over
his
eyes
the
rain
fell
endlessly
rattling
on
the
roof
of
the
car
dancing
silver
in
the
puddles
of
the
road
their
boredom
fell
into
the
rhythm
of
crooning
of
the
old
coon
song
been
workin
on
de
railroad
all
de
livelong
day
i
been
workin
on
de
railroad
jus
to
pass
de
time
oh
god
something
got
to
happen
soon
lost
in
rubber
boots
and
a
huge
gleaming
slicker
and
hood
the
section
leader
splashed
across
the
road
all
cars

attack
this
concentration
of
sanitary
sections
means
something
you
ca
tell
me
they
say
they
have
beer
said
the
aspirant
behind
martin
in
the
long
line
of
men
who
waited
in
the
hot
sun
for
the
copé
to
open
while
the
dust
the
staff
cars
and
camions
raised
as
they
whirred
by
on
the
road
settled
in
a
blanket
over
the
village
cold
beer
of
course
not
said
the
aspirant
laughing
so
that
all
the
brilliant
ivory
teeth
showed
behind
his
red
lips
it
be
detestable
getting
it
because
it
rare
for
sentimental
reasons
martin
laughed
looking
in
the
man
brown
face
a
face
in
which
all
past
expressions
seemed
to
linger
in
the
fine
lines
about
the
mouth
and
eyes
and
in
the
modelling
of
the
cheeks
and
temples
you
do
understand
that
said
the
aspirant
again
indeed
i
do
later
they
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
stone
wellhead
in
the
courtyard
behind
the
store
drinking
warm
beer
out
of
tin
cups
blackened
by
wine
and
staring
at
a
tall
barn
that
had
crumpled
at
one
end
so
that
it
looked
with
its
two
frightened
little
square
windows
like
a
cow
kneeling
down
is
it
true
that
the
going
up
to
the
lines
yes
we
going
up
to
make
a
little
attack
probably
i
come
back
in
your
little
omnibus
i
hope
you
wo
i
be
very
glad
to
a
lucky
wound
but
i
probably
be
killed
this
is
the
first
time
i
gone
up
to
the
front
that
i
did
expect
to
be
killed
so
it
probably
happen
martin
howe
could
not
help
looking
at
him
suddenly
the
aspirant
sat
at
ease
on
the
stone
margin
of
the
well
leaning
against
the
wrought
iron
support
for
the
bucket
one
knee
clasped
in
his
strong
hands
dead
he
would
be
different
martin
mind
could
hardly
grasp
the
connection
between
this
man
full
of
latent
energies
full
of
thoughts
and
desires
this
man
whose
shoulder
he
would
have
liked
to
have
put
his
arm
round
from
friendliness
with
whom
he
would
have
liked
to
go
for
long
walks
with
whom
he
would
have
liked
to
sit
long
into
the
night
drinking
and
talking
and
those
huddled
pulpy
masses
of
blue
uniform
in
the
mud
of
ditches
have
you
ever
seen
a
herd
of
cattle
being
driven
to
abattoir
on
a
fine
may
morning
asked
the
aspirant
in
a
scornful
jaunty
tone
as
if
he
had
guessed
martin
thoughts
i
wonder
what
they
think
of
it
it
not
that
i
resigned
do
think
that
resignation
is
too
easy
that
why
the
herd
can
be
driven
by
a
boy
of
six
or
a
prime
minister
martin
was
sitting
with
his
arms
crossed
the
fingers
of
one
hand
were
squeezing
the
muscle
of
his
forearm
it
gave
him
pleasure
to
feel
the
smooth
firm
modelling
of
his
arm
through
his
sleeve
and
how
would
that
feel
when
it
was
dead
when
a
steel
splinter
had
slithered
through
it
a
momentary
stench
of
putrefaction
filled
his
nostrils
making
his
stomach
contract
with
nausea
i
not
resigned
either
he
shouted
in
a
laugh
i
am
going
to
do
something
some
day
but
first
i
must
see
i
want
to
be
initiated
in
all
the
circles
of
hell
i
play
the
part
of
virgil
pretty
well
said
the
aspirant
but
i
suppose
virgil
was
a
staff
officer
i
must
go
said
martin
my
name
martin
howe
oh
yes

are
quartered
in
the
square
my
name
is
merrier
probably
carry
me
back
in
your
little
omnibus
when
howe
got
back
to
where
the
cars
were
packed
in
a
row
in
the
village
square
randolph
came
up
to
him
and
whispered
in
his
ear
what
that
the
attack
it
at
three
in
the
morning
instructions
are
going
to
be
given
out
a
detonation
behind
them
was
like
a
blow
on
the
head
making
their
ring
the
glass
in
the
headlight
of
one
of
the
cars
tinkled
to
the
ground
the
behind
the
church
that
was
pretty
near
knocks
the
wind
out
of
you
say
randolph
have
you
heard
the
new
orders
no
a
tall
man
came
out
from
the
front
of
his
car
where
he
had
been
working
on
the
motor
holding
his
hands
away
from
him
it
put
off
he
said
lowering
his
voice
mysteriously
not
till
day
after
at
but
we
going
up
to
relieve
the
section
that
coming
out
and
take
over
the
posts
they
say
it
hell
up
there
the
germans
have
a
new
gas
that
you
ca
smell
at
all
the
other
section
got
about
five
men
gassed
and
a
bunch
of
them
have
broken
down
the
posts
are
shelled
all
the
time
great
said
tom
randolph
we
see
the
real
thing
this
time
there
was
a
whistling
shriek
overhead
and
all
three
of
them
fell
in
a
heap
on
the
ground
in
front
of
the
car
there
was
a
crash
that
echoed
amid
the
and
a
pillar
of
black
smoke
stood
like
a
cypress
tree
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
street
talk
about
the
real
thing
said
martin
ole
evidently
woke
up
some
it
was
the
fifth
time
that
day
that
martin
car
had
passed
the
where
the
calvary
was
someone
had
propped
up
the
fallen
crucifix
so
that
it
tilted
dark
despairing
arms
against
the
sunset
sky
where
the
sun
gleamed
like
a
huge
copper
kettle
lost
in
its
own
steam
the
rain
made
bright
yellowish
stripes
across
the
sky
and
dripped
from
the
cracked
feet
of
the
old
wooden
christ
whose
gaunt
scarred
figure
hung
out
from
the
tilted
cross
swaying
a
little
under
the
beating
of
the
rain
martin
was
wiping
the
mud
from
his
hands
after
changing
a
wheel
he
stared
curiously
at
the
fallen
jowl
and
the
cavernous
eyes
that
had
meant
for
some
country
sculptor
ages
ago
the
utterest
agony
of
pain
suddenly
he
noticed
that
where
the
crown
of
thorns
had
been
about
the
forehead
of
the
christ
someone
had
wound
barbed
wire
he
smiled
and
asked
the
swaying
figure
in
his
mind
and
you
what
do
you
think
of
it
for
an
instant
he
could
feel
wire
barbs
ripping
through
his
own
flesh
he
leaned
over
to
crank
the
car
the
road
was
filled
suddenly
with
the
tramp
and
splash
of
troops
marching
their
wet
helmets
and
their
rifles
gleaming
in
the
coppery
sunset
even
through
the
clean
rain
came
the
smell
of
filth
and
sweat
and
misery
of
troops
marching
the
faces
under
the
helmets
were
strained
and
colourless
and
cadaverous
from
the
weight
of
the
equipment
on
their
necks
and
their
backs
and
their
thighs
the
faces
drooped
under
the
helmets
tilted
to
one
side
or
the
other
distorted
and
wooden
like
the
face
of
the
figure
that
dangled
from
the
cross
above
the
splash
of
feet
through
mud
and
the
jingle
of
equipment
came
occasionally
the
ping
ping
of
shrapnel
bursting
at
the
next
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
martin
sat
in
the
car
with
the
motor
racing
waiting
for
the
end
of
the
column
one
of
the
stragglers
who
floundered
along
through
the
churned
mud
of
the
road
after
the
regular
ranks
had
passed
stopped
still
and
looked
up
at
the
tilted
cross
from
the
next
came
at
intervals
the
sharp
twanging
ping
of
shrapnel
bursting
the
straggler
suddenly
began
kicking
feebly
at
the
prop
of
the
cross
with
his
foot
and
then
dragged
himself
off
after
the
column
the
cross
fell
forward
with
a
dull
splintering
splash
into
the
mud
of
the
road
the
road
went
down
the
hill
in
long
through
a
village
at
the
bottom
where
out
of
the
mist
that
steamed
from
the
little
river
a
spire
with
a
bent
weathercock
rose
above
the
broken
roof
of
the
church
then
up
the
hill
again
into
the
woods
in
the
woods
the
road
stretched
green
and
gold
in
the
first
horizontal
sunlight
among
the
thick
trees
roofs
covered
with
branches
were
rows
of
long
portable
barracks
with
doors
decorated
with
rustic
work
at
one
place
a
sign
announced
in
letters
made
of
wattled
sticks
des
a
few
birds
sang
in
the
woods
and
at
a
pump
they
passed
a
lot
of
men
stripped
to
the
waist
who
were
leaning
over
washing
laughing
and
splashing
in
the
sunlight
every
now
and
then
distant
metallic
the
pong
pong
pong
of
a
battery
of
resounded
through
the
rustling
trees
looks
like
a
camp
meetin
ground
in
georgia
said
tom
randolph
blowing
his
whistle
to
make
two
men
carrying
a
large
steaming
pot
on
a
pole
between
them
get
out
of
the
way
the
road
became
muddier
as
they
went
deeper
into
the
woods
and
turning
into
a
the
car
began
slithering
skidding
a
little
at
the
turns
through
thick
soupy
mud
on
either
side
the
woods
became
broken
and
jagged
stumps
and
split
boughs
littering
the
ground
trees
snapped
off
halfway
up
in
the
air
there
was
a
scent
of
timber
and
of
woodland
earth
and
among
them
a
sweetish
rough
smell
covered
with
greenish
mud
splashing
the
mud
right
and
left
with
their
great
flat
wheels
camions
began
passing
them
returning
from
the
direction
of
the
lines
at
last
at
a
small
red
cross
flag
they
stopped
and
ran
the
car
into
a
grove
of
tall
chestnuts
where
they
parked
it
beside
another
car
of
their
section
and
lay
down
among
the
crisp
leaves
listening
to
occasional
shells
whining
far
overhead
all
through
the
wood
was
a
continuous
ping
pong
ping
of
batteries
with
the
crash
of
a
big
gun
coming
now
and
then
like
the
growl
of
a
among
the
of
small
toads
in
a
pond
at
night
through
the
trees
from
where
they
lay
they
could
see
the
wooden
crosses
of
a
cemetery
from
which
came
a
sound
of
spaded
earth
and
where
preceded
by
a
priest
in
a
muddy
cassock
little
carts
piled
with
shapeless
things
in
sacks
kept
being
brought
up
and
unloaded
and
dragged
away
again
showing
alternately
dark
and
light
in
the
sun
and
shadow
of
the
woodland
road
a
cook
waggon
short
chimney
giving
out
blue
smoke
and
cauldrons
steaming
clatters
ahead
of
martin
and
randolph
the
backs
of
two
men
in
heavy
blue
coats
their
helmets
showing
above
the
narrow
driver
seat
on
either
side
of
the
road
short
yellow
flames
keep
spitting
up
slanting
from
hidden
guns
amid
a
pandemonium
of
noise
up
the
road
a
sudden
column
of
black
smoke
rises
among
falling
trees
a
louder
explosion
and
the
cook
waggon
in
front
of
them
vanishes
in
a
new
whirl
of
thick
smoke
accelerator
pressed
down
the
car
plunges
along
the
rutted
road
tips
and
a
wheel
sinks
in
the
new
the
hind
wheels
spin
for
a
moment
spattering
gravel
about
and
just
as
another
roar
comes
behind
them
bite
into
the
road
again
and
the
car
goes
on
speeding
through
the
alternate
sun
and
shadow
of
the
woods
martin
remembers
the
beating
legs
of
a
mule
rolling
on
its
back
on
the
side
of
the
road
and
steaming
in
the
fresh
morning
air
the
purple
and
yellow
and
red
of
its
ripped
belly
did
you
get
the
smell
of
almonds
i
sort
of
like
it
says
randolph
drawing
a
long
breath
as
the
car
slowed
down
again
the
woods
at
night
fantastic
blackness
full
of
noise
and
yellow
leaping
flames
from
the
mouths
of
guns
now
and
then
the
sulphurous
flash
of
a
shell
explosion
and
the
sound
of
trees
falling
and
shell
fragments
swishing
through
the
air
at
intervals
over
a
little
knoll
in
the
direction
of
the
trenches
a
white
falls
slowly
making
the
trees
and
the
guns
among
their
tangle
of
hiding
branches
cast
long
shadows
drowning
the
wood
in
a
strange
glare
of
desolation
where
the
devil
the
abri
everything
drowned
in
the
detonations
of
three
guns
one
after
the
other
so
near
as
to
puff
hot
air
in
their
faces
in
the
midst
of
the
blinding
concussion
look
tom
this
is
foolish
the
abri
right
here
i
have
got
it
in
my
pocket
howe
damn
those
guns
again
everything
is
crushed
in
the
concussion
of
the
guns
they
throw
themselves
on
the
ground
as
a
shell
shrieks
and
explodes
there
is
a
moment
pause
and
gravel
and
bits
of
bark
tumble
about
their
heads
we
got
to
find
that
abri
i
wish
i
had
lost
my
flashlight
here
it
is
no
that
stinks
too
much
must
be
the
latrine
say
tom
here
damn
i
ran
into
a
tree
i
found
it
all
right
coming
martin
held
out
his
hand
until
randolph
bumped
into
it
then
they
stumbled
together
down
the
rough
wooden
steps
pulled
aside
the
blanket
that
served
to
keep
the
light
in
and
found
themselves
blinking
in
the
low
tunnel
of
the
abri
brancardiers
were
asleep
in
the
two
tiers
of
bunks
that
filled
up
the
sides
and
at
the
table
at
the
end
a
lieutenant
of
the
medical
corps
was
writing
by
the
light
of
a
smoky
lamp
they
are
landing
some
round
here
he
said
pointing
out
two
unoccupied
bunks
i
call
you
when
we
need
a
car
as
he
spoke
in
succession
the
three
big
guns
went
off
the
concussion
put
the
lamp
out
damn
said
tom
randolph
the
lieutenant
swore
and
struck
a
match
the
red
light
of
the
poste
de
secours
is
out
too
said
martin
no
use
lighting
it
again
with
those
unholy
mortars
it
idiotic
to
put
a
poste
de
secours
in
the
middle
of
a
battery
like
this
the
americans
lay
down
to
try
to
sleep
shell
after
shell
exploded
round
the
dugout
but
regularly
every
few
minutes
came
the
hammer
blows
of
the
mortars
half
the
time
putting
the
light
out
a
shell
explosion
seemed
to
split
the
dugout
and
a
piece
of
éclat
whizzed
through
the
blanket
that
curtained
off
the
door
someone
tried
to
pick
it
up
as
it
lay
in
the
board
floor
and
pulled
his
fingers
away
quickly
blowing
on
them
the
men
turned
over
in
the
bunks
and
laughed
and
a
smile
came
over
the
drawn
green
face
of
a
wounded
man
who
sat
very
quiet
behind
the
lieutenant
staring
at
the
smoky
flame
of
the
lamp
the
curtain
was
pulled
aside
and
a
man
staggered
in
holding
with
the
other
hand
a
limp
arm
twisted
in
a
sleeve
from
which
blood
and
mud
dripped
on
to
the
floor
hello
old
chap
said
the
doctor
quietly
a
smell
of
disinfectant
stole
through
the
dugout
faint
above
the
incessant
throbbing
of
explosions
the
sound
of
a
claxon
horn
ha
gas
said
the
doctor
put
on
your
masks
children
a
man
went
along
the
dugout
waking
those
who
were
asleep
and
giving
out
fresh
masks
someone
stood
in
the
doorway
blowing
a
shrill
whistle
then
there
was
again
the
clamour
of
a
claxon
near
at
hand
the
band
of
the
gas
mask
was
tight
about
martin
forehead
biting
into
the
skin
he
and
randolph
sat
side
by
side
on
the
edge
of
the
bunk
looking
out
through
the
crinkled
isinglass
eyepieces
at
the
men
in
the
dugout
most
of
whom
had
gone
to
sleep
again
god
i
envy
a
man
who
can
snore
through
a
said
randolph
men
heads
had
a
ghoulish
look
strange
large
eyes
and
grey
oilcloth
flaps
instead
of
faces
outside
the
constant
explosions
had
given
place
to
a
series
of
swishing
whistles
merging
together
into
a
sound
as
of
water
falling
only
less
regular
more
sibilant
occasionally
there
was
the
rending
burst
of
a
shell
and
at
intervals
came
the
swinging
detonations
of
the
three
guns
in
the
dugout
except
for
two
men
who
snored
loudly
raspingly
everyone
was
quiet
several
stretchers
with
wounded
men
on
them
were
brought
in
and
laid
in
the
end
of
the
dugout
gradually
as
the
bombardment
continued
men
began
sliding
into
the
dugout
crowding
together
touching
each
other
for
company
speaking
in
low
voices
through
their
masks
a
mask
in
the
name
of
god
a
mask
a
voice
shouted
breaking
into
a
squeal
and
an
unshaven
man
with
mud
caked
in
his
hair
and
beard
burst
through
the
curtain
his
eyelids
kept
up
a
continual
trembling
and
the
water
streamed
down
both
sides
of
his
nose
o
god
he
kept
talking
in
a
rasping
whisper
o
god
they
all
killed
there
were
six
mules
on
my
waggon
and
a
shell
killed
them
all
and
threw
me
into
the
ditch

ca
find
the
road

an
orderly

wiping
his
face
as
if
it
were
a
child
they
all
killed
and
i
lost
my
mask
o
god
this
gas
the
doctor
a
short
man
looking
like
a
gnome
in
his
mask
with
its
wheezing
rubber
nosepiece
was
walking
up
and
down
with
short
slow
steps
suddenly
as
three
soldiers
came
in
drawing
the
curtain
aside
he
shouted
in
a
shrill
voice
keep
the
curtain
closed
do
you
want
to
asphyxiate
us
he
strode
up
to
the
newcomers
his
voice
strident
like
an
angry
woman
what
are

here

is
the
poste
de
secours

hell

of
here
hear
the
men
began
stumbling
out
into
the
darkness
tightening
the
adjustments
of
their
masks
behind
their
heads
the
guns
had
stopped
firing
there
was
nothing
but
the
constant
swishing
and
whistling
of
like
endless
pails
of
dirty
water
being
thrown
on
gravel
we
been
at
it
three
hours
whispered
martin
to
tom
randolph
god

masks

the
sweat

in
the
eyepieces

brancardier

martin

cried
randolph
getting
to
his
feet
they
started
out
of
the
door
together
in
the
light
that
streamed
out
as
they
drew
the
flap
aside
they
saw
a
tree
opposite
them
a
shell
exploded
it
seemed
right
on
top
of
them
the
tree
rose
and
bowed
towards
them
and
fell
are

there
tom
whispered
martin
his
ears
ringing
bet
your
life
someone
pulled
them
back
into
the
abri
here
we
found
another
martin
lay
down
on
the
bunk
again
drawing
with
difficulty
each
breath
his
lips
had
a
wet
decomposed
feeling
at
the
wrist
of
the
arm
he
rested
his
head
on
the
watch
ticked
comfortably
he
began
to
think
how
ridiculous
it
would
be
if
he
martin
howe
should
be
extinguished
like
this
the
might
be
defective
god
it
would
be
silly
outside
the
were
still
coming
in
the
lamp
showed
through
a
faint
bluish
haze
everyone
was
still
waiting
another
hour
martin
began
to
recite
to
himself
the
only
thing
he
could
remember
over
and
over
again
in
time
to
the
ticking
of
his
watch
sunflower
weary
of
time
ah
sunflower
weary
of
time
who
countest
the
steps
of
the
sun
ah
sunflower
weary
of
time
who
countest
one
two
three
four
he
counted
the
shells
outside
exploding
at
irregular
intervals
there
were
periods
of
absolute
silence
when
he
could
hear
batteries
pong
pong
pong
in
the
distance
he
began
again
sunflower
weary
of
time
who
countest
the
steps
of
the
sun
in
search
of
that
far
golden
clime
where
the
traveller
journey
is
the
youth
pined
away
with
desire
and
the
pale
virgin
shrouded
in
snow
arise
from
their
graves
and
aspire
where
my
sunflower
wishes
to
whang
whang
whang
the
battery
alongside
began
again
sending
out
the
light
someone
pulled
the
blanket
aside
a
little
leprous
greyness
filtered
into
the
dugout
ah
it
getting
light
the
doctor
went
out
and
they
could
hear
his
steps
climbing
up
to
the
level
of
the
ground
howe
saw
a
man
take
his
mask
off
and
spit
oh
god
a
cigarette
tom
randolph
cried
pulling
his
mask
off
the
air
of
the
woods
was
fresh
and
cool
outside
everything
was
lost
in
mist
that
filled
the
as
with
water
and
wreathed
itself
fantastically
about
the
shattered
trunks
of
trees
here
and
there
was
still
a
little
greenish
haze
of
gas
it
cut
their
throats
and
made
their
eyes
run
as
they
breathed
in
the
cool
air
of
the
dawn
dawn
in
a
wilderness
of
jagged
stumps
and
ploughed
earth
against
the
yellow
sky
the
yellow
glare
of
guns
that
squat
like
toads
in
a
tangle
of
wire
and
piles
of
brass
and
split
wooden
boxes
long
rutted
roads
littered
with
stretching
through
the
wrecked
woods
in
the
yellow
light
strung
alongside
of
them
tangled
masses
of
telephone
wires
torn
camouflage
fluttering
against
the
ardent
yellow
sky
and
twining
among
the
fantastic
black
leafless
trees
the
greenish
wraiths
of
gas
along
the
roads
camions
overturned
dead
mules
tangled
in
their
traces
beside
shattered
caissons
huddled
bodies
in
long
blue
coats
half
buried
in
the
mud
of
the
ditches
we

two
camions

blocked
across

road
and
there

three
batteries
of
waiting
to
get
up
the
road
long
lines
of
men
on
horseback

of

to
a
poste
de

the
fresh
air
blowing
hard
in
their
faces
and
the
woods
getting
greener
on
either
side
full
of
ferns
and
small
plants
that
half
cover
the
strands
of
barbed
wire
and
the
rows
of
shells
at
the
end
of
the
woods
the
sun
rises
golden
into
a
cloudless
sky
and
on
the
grassy
slope
of
the
valley
sheep
and
a
herd
of
little
donkeys
are
feeding
looking
up
with
quietly
moving
jaws
as
the
ambulance
smelling
of
blood
and
filthy
clothes
rattles
by
black
night
all
through
the
woods
along
the
road
squatting
mortars
spit
yellow
flame
constant
throbbing
of
detonations
martin
inside
the
ambulance
is
holding
together
a
broken
stretcher
while
the
car
jolts
slowly
along
it
is
pitch
dark
in
the
car
except
when
the
glare
of
a
gun
from
near
the
road
gives
him
a
momentary
view
of
the
man
head
a
mass
of
bandages
from
the
middle
of
which
a
little
bit
of
beard
sticks
out
and
of
his
lean
body
tossing
on
the
stretcher
with
every
jolt
of
the
car
martin
is
kneeling
on
the
floor
of
the
car
his
knees
bruised
by
the
jolting
holding
the
man
on
the
stretcher
with
his
chest
pressed
on
the
man
chest
and
one
arm
stretched
down
to
keep
the
limp
bandaged
leg
still
the
man
breath
comes
with
a
bubbling
sound
now
and
then
mingling
with
an
articulate
groan
softly
oh
softly
oh
oh
oh
slow
as
you
can
tom
old
man
martin
calls
out
above
the
pandemonium
of
firing
on
both
sides
of
the
road
tightening
the
muscles
of
his
arm
in
a
desperate
effort
to
keep
the
limp
leg
from
bouncing
the
smell
of
blood
and
filth
is
misery
in
his
nostrils
softly
softly
oh
oh
oh
the
groan
is
barely
heard
amid
the
bubbling
breath
pitch
dark
in
the
car
martin
his
every
muscle
taut
with
the
agony
of
the
man
pain
is
on
his
knees
pressing
his
chest
on
the
man
chest
trying
with
an
arm
stretched
along
the
man
leg
to
keep
him
from
bouncing
in
the
broken
stretcher
need
have
troubled
to
have
brought
him
said
the
hospital
orderly
as
blood
dripped
fast
from
the
stretcher
black
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
he
pretty
near
dead
now
he
wo
last
long
chapter
vii
so
you
like
it
will
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
martin
howe
was
stretched
on
the
grass
of
a
hillside
a
little
above
a
beside
him
squatted
a
youth
with
a
smudge
of
grease
on
his
nose
a
champagne
bottle
rested
against
his
knees
yes
i
never
been
happier
in
my
life
it
a
coarse
boozing
sort
of
a
life
but
i
like
it
they
looked
over
the
landscape
of
greyish
rolling
hills
scarred
everywhere
by
new
roads
and
ranks
of
wooden
shacks
along
the
road
beneath
them
crawled
like
beetles
convoy
after
convoy
of
the
wind
came
to
them
full
of
a
stench
of
latrines
and
of
the
exhaust
of
motors
the
last
time
i
saw
you
said
martin
after
a
pause
was
early
one
morning
on
the
cambridge
bridge
i
was
walking
out
from
boston
and
we
talked
of
the
eroica
they
played
at
the
symphony
and
you
said
it
was
silly
to
have
a
great
musician
try
to
play
soldier
remember
no
that
was
in
another
incarnation
have
some
fizz
he
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
battered
tin
cup
but
talking
about
playing
soldier
howe
i
must
tell
you
about
how
our
lieutenant
got
the
croix
de
guerre
somebody
ought
to
write
a
book
called
of
the
great
i
am
sure
that
many
people
have
and
will
you
probably
do
it
yourself
will
but
go
on
the
sun
burst
from
the
huddled
clouds
for
a
moment
mottling
the
hills
and
the
scarred
valleys
with
light
the
shadow
of
an
aeroplane
flying
low
passed
across
the
field
and
the
snoring
of
its
motors
cut
out
all
other
sound
well
our
louie
name
duval
but
he
spells
it
with
a
small
and
a
big
he
been
wanting
a
croix
de
guerre
for
a
hell
of
a
time
because
lots
of
fellows
in
the
section
have
been
getting
he
tried
giving
dinners
to
the
general
staff
and
everything
but
that
did
seem
to
work
so
there
was
nothing
to
it
but
to
get
wounded
so
he
took
to
going
to
the
front
posts
but
the
trouble
was
that
it
was
a
hell
of
a
quiet
sector
and
no
shells
ever
came
within
a
mile
of
it
at
last
somebody
made
a
mistake
and
a
little
austrian
came
tumbling
in
and
popped
about
fifty
yards
from
his
staff
car
he
showed
the
most
marvellous
presence
of
mind
he
clapped
his
hand
over
his
eye
and
sank
back
in
the
seat
with
a
groan
the
doctor
asked
what
was
the
matter
but
old
duval
just
kept
his
hand
tight
over
his
eye
and
said
nothing
just
a
scratch
and
went
off
to
inspect
the
posts
of
course
the
posts
did
need
inspecting
and
he
rode
round
all
day
with
a
handkerchief
over
one
eye
and
a
look
of
heroism
in
the
other
but
never
would
he
let
the
doctor
even
peep
at
it
next
morning
he
came
out
with
a
bandage
round
his
head
as
big
as
a
sheik
turban
he
went
to
see
headquarters
in
that
and
lunched
with
the
well
he
got
his
croix
de
guerre
all
right
cited
for
assuring
the
evacuation
of
the
wounded
under
fire
and
all
the
rest
of
it
some
bird
he
probably
get
to
be
a
general
before
the
war
over
howe
poured
out
the
last
of
the
champagne
and
threw
the
bottle
listlessly
off
into
the
grass
where
it
struck
an
empty
and
broke
but
will
you
ca
like
this
he
said
it
all
so
like
an
a
huge
of
men
and
equipment
i
suppose
it
is
said
the
youth
discovering
the
grease
on
his
nose
and
rubbing
it
off
with
the
back
of
his
hand
damn
those
dirty
fords
they
get
grease
all
over
you
i
suppose
it
is
that
life
was
so
dull
in
america
that
anything
seems
better
i
worked
a
year
in
an
office
before
leaving
home
give
me
the
look
said
martin
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
staring
straight
up
into
the
sky
there
are
two
planes
fighting
they
both
screwed
up
their
eyes
to
stare
into
the
sky
where
two
bits
of
mica
were
circling
below
them
like
wads
of
some
white
and
others
black
were
rows
of
the
of
shrapnel
from
guns
the
two
boys
watched
the
specks
in
silence
at
last
one
began
to
grow
larger
seemed
to
be
falling
in
wide
spirals
the
other
had
vanished
the
falling
aeroplane
started
rising
again
into
the
middle
sky
then
stopped
suddenly
burst
into
flames
and
fluttered
down
behind
the
hills
leaving
an
irregular
trail
of
smoke
more
garbage
said
the
youth
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
shrapnel
what
a
funny
place
to
shoot
shrapnel
they
must
have
got
the
bead
on
that
bunch
of
material
the
bringing
in
there
was
an
explosion
and
a
vicious
whine
of
shrapnel
bullets
among
the
trees
on
the
road
a
turned
round
hastily
and
speeded
back
martin
got
up
from
where
he
was
lying
on
the
grass
under
a
pine
tree
looking
at
the
sky
and
put
his
helmet
on
as
he
did
so
there
was
another
sharp
bang
overhead
and
a
little
cloud
that
suddenly
spread
and
drifted
away
among
the
quiet
he
took
off
his
helmet
and
examined
it
quizzically
tom
i
got
a
dent
in
the
helmet
tom
randolph
made
a
grab
for
the
little
piece
of
jagged
iron
that
had
rebounded
from
the
helmet
and
lay
at
his
feet
god
damn
it
hot
he
cried
dropping
it
anyway
keepings
he
put
his
foot
on
the
shrapnel
splinter
that
ought
to
be
mine
i
swear
tom
you
got
the
dent
howe
what
more
do
you
want
damn
hog
martin
sat
on
the
top
step
of
the
dugout
diving
down
whenever
he
heard
a
loudening
in
the
distance
beside
him
was
a
tall
man
with
the
crossed
cannon
of
the
artillery
in
his
helmet
and
a
shrunken
brown
face
with
cheeks
and
very
long
silky
black
moustaches
a
dirty
business
he
said
it
idiotic
name
of
a
dog
grabbing
each
other
arms
they
tumbled
down
the
steps
together
as
a
shell
passed
overhead
to
burst
in
a
tree
down
the
road
now
look
at
that
the
man
held
up
his
musette
to
howe
i
broken
the
bottle
of
bordeaux
i
had
in
my
musette
it
idiotic
been
on
permission
do
i
look
it
they
sat
at
the
top
of
the
steps
again
the
man
took
out
bits
of
wet
glass
dripping
red
wine
from
his
little
bag
swearing
all
the
while
i
was
bringing
it
to
the
little
captain
he
a
nice
little
old
chap
the
little
captain
and

from
my
own
vines

it
there
still
a
little
he
held
up
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
martin
took
a
sip
the
artilleryman
drank
the
rest
of
it
twisted
his
long
moustaches
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
go
there
my
poor
good
old
wine
he
threw
the
remnants
of
the
bottle
into
the
underbrush
shrapnel
burst
a
little
down
the
road
oh

is
a
dirty
business

put
a
dirty
brown
hand
on
martin
arm
how
old
do
you
think
i
am
i
am
look
at
the
picture
from
a
tattered
black
held
together
by
an
elastic
band
he
pulled
a
snapshot
of
a
young
man
with
a
fleshy
face
and
his
hands
tucked
into
the
top
of
a
wide
sash
he
looked
at
the
picture
smiling
and
tugging
at
one
of
his
long
moustaches
then
i
was
twenty
it
the
war
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
put
the
picture
carefully
back
into
his
inside
pocket
oh
it
idiotic
you
must
have
had
a
tough
time
it
just
that
people
are
meant
for
this
sort
of
thing
said
the
artilleryman
quietly
you
do
get
accustomed
the
more
you
see
the
worse
it
is
then
you
end
by
going
crazy
oh

of

savagely
on
the
first

of
the
dugout

the
artilleryman
jumped
up
and
began
dancing
spanish
fashion
snapping
his
fingers
his
big
moustaches
swaying
and
trembling
several
shells
burst
down
the
road
in
quick
succession
filling
the
air
with
a
whine
of
fragments
a
cook
waggon
got
it
the
artilleryman
shouted
dancing
on
la
la
he
sang
snapping
his
fingers
he
stopped
and
spat
again
what
do
i
care
he
said
well
so
long
old
chap
i
must
go
say
let
change
knives
a
little
souvenir
great
good
luck
the
artilleryman
strode
off
through
the
woods
past
the
portable
fence
that
surrounded
the
huddled
wooden
crosses
of
the
graveyard
against
the
red
glare
of
the
dawn
the
wilderness
of
shattered
trees
stands
out
purple
hidden
by
grey
mist
in
the
hollows
looped
and
draped
fantastically
with
strands
of
telephone
wire
and
barbed
wire
tangled
like
leafless
creepers
that
hang
in
clots
against
the
red
sky
here
and
there
guns
squat
among
piles
of
shells
covered
with
mottled
green
and
spit
long
tongues
of
yellow
flame
against
the
sky
the
ambulance
waits
by
the
side
of
the
rutted
road
littered
with
tin
cans
and
brass
while
a
doctor
and
two
bend
over
a
man
on
a
stretcher
laid
among
the
underbrush
the
man
groans
and
there
is
a
sound
of
ripping
bandages
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
a
fallen
mule
feebly
wags
its
head
from
side
to
side
a
mass
of
purple
froth
hanging
from
its
mouth
and
scarlet
nostrils
there
is
a
new
smell
in
the
wind
a
smell
unutterably
sordid
like
the
smell
of
the
poor
immigrants
landing
at
ellis
island
martin
howe
glances
round
and
sees
advancing
down
the
road
ranks
and
ranks
of
strange
grey
men
whose
helmets
give
an
eerie
look
as
of
men
from
the
moon
in
a
fairy
tale
why
they
germans
he
says
to
himself
i
quite
forgotten
they
existed
ah
they
prisoners
the
doctor
gets
to
his
feet
and
glances
down
the
road
and
then
turns
to
his
work
again
the
tramp
of
feet
marching
in
unison
on
the
rough
road
and
piles
and
piles
of
grey
men
clotted
with
dried
mud
from
whom
comes
the
new
smell
the
sordid
miserable
smell
of
the
enemy
things
going
well
martin
asks
a
guard
a
man
with
ashen
face
and
eyes
that
burn
out
of
black
sockets
how
should
i
know
many
prisoners
how
should
i
know
the
captain
and
the
aumonier
are
taking
their
breakfast
each
sitting
on
a
with
their
tin
cups
and
tin
plates
ranged
on
the
board
propped
up
between
them
all
round
red
clay
out
of
which
the
abri
was
excavated
a
smell
of
antiseptics
from
the
door
of
the
and
of
lime
and
latrines
mingling
with
the
greasy
smell
of
the
movable
kitchen
not
far
away
they
are
eating
dessert
slices
of
pineapple
speared
with
a
knife
out
of
a
can
in
their
manner
there
is
something
that
makes
martin
see
vividly
two
gentlemen
in
dining
at
a
table
under
the
awning
of
a
café
on
the
boulevards
it
has
a
leisurely
ceremoniousness
an
ease
that
could
exist
nowhere
else
no
my
friend
the
doctor
is
saying
i
do
not
think
that
an
apprehension
of
religion
existed
in
the
mind
of
palæolithic
man
but
my
captain
do
you
think
that
you
scientific
people
sometimes
lose
a
little
of
the
significance
of
things
insisting
always
on
their
scientific
in
this
case
on
their
anthropological
aspect
not
in
the
least
it
is
the
only
way
to
look
at
them
there
are
other
ways
says
the
aumonier
smiling
one
moment
from
under
the
the
captain
produced
a
small
bottle
of
anisette
you
have
a
little
glass
wo
you
with
the
greatest
pleasure
what
a
rarity
here
anisette
but
as
i
was
about
to
say
take
our
life
here
for
an
example
a
shell
shrieks
overhead
and
crashes
hollowly
in
the
woods
behind
the
dugout
another
follows
it
exploding
nearer
the
captain
picks
a
few
bits
of
gravel
off
the
table
reaches
for
his
helmet
and
continues
for
example
our
life
here
which
is
as
was
the
life
of
palæolithic
man
taken
up
only
with
the
bare
struggle
for
existence
against
overwhelming
odds
you
know
yourself
that
it
is
not
conducive
to
religion
or
any
emotion
except
that
of
preservation
i
hardly
admit
that
ah
i
saved
it
the
aumonier
announces
catching
the
bottle
of
anisette
as
it
is
about
to
fall
off
the
table
an
exploding
shell
rends
the
air
about
them
there
is
a
pause
and
a
shower
of
earth
and
gravel
tumbles
about
their
ears
i
must
go
and
see
if
anyone
was
hurt
says
the
aumonier
clambering
up
the
clay
bank
to
the
level
of
the
ground
but
you
will
admit
my
captain
that
the
sentiment
of
preservation
is
at
least
akin
to
the
fundamental
feelings
of
religion
my
dear
friend
i
admit
nothing
till
this
evening
he
waves
his
hand
and
goes
into
the
dugout
martin
and
two
french
soldiers
drinking
sour
wine
in
the
doorway
of
a
deserted
house
it
was
raining
outside
and
now
and
then
a
dripping
camion
passed
along
the
road
slithering
through
the
mud
this
is
the
last
summer
of
the
war
it
must
be
said
the
little
man
with
large
brown
eyes
and
a
childish
chubby
brown
face
who
sat
on
martin
left
why
oh
i
do
know
everyone
feels
like
that
i
do
see
said
martin
why
it
should
last
for
ten
or
twenty
years
wars
have
before
how
long
have
you
been
at
the
front
six
months
off
and
on
after
another
six
months
you
know
why
it
ca
go
on
i
do
know
it
suits
me
all
right
said
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
martin
a
man
with
a
jovial
red
face
of
course
i
like
being
dirty
and
smelling
and
all
that
but
one
gets
accustomed
to
it
but
you
are
an
alsatian
you
do
care
i
was
a
baker
they
going
to
send
me
to
dijon
soon
to
bake
army
bread
it
be
a
change
there
be
wine
and
lots
of
little
girls
good
god
how
drunk
i
be
and
old
chap
you
just
watch
me
with
the
women
i
should
just
like
to
get
home
and
not
be
ordered
about
said
the
first
man
i
been
lucky
though
he
went
on
i
been
kept
most
of
the
time
in
reserve
i
only
had
to
use
my
bayonet
once
when
was
that
asked
martin
near
mont
cornélien
last
year
we
put
them
to
the
bayonet
and
i
was
running
and
a
man
threw
his
arms
up
just
in
front
of
me
saying
ami
mon
ami
in
french
i
ran
on
because
i
could
stop
and
i
heard
my
bayonet
grind
as
it
went
through
his
chest
i
tripped
over
something
and
fell
down
you
were
scared
said
the
alsatian
of
course
i
was
scared
i
was
trembling
all
over
like
an
old
dog
in
a
thunderstorm
when
i
got
up
he
was
lying
on
his
side
with
his
mouth
open
and
blood
running
out
my
bayonet
still
sticking
into
him
you
know
you
have
to
put
your
foot
against
a
man
and
pull
hard
to
get
the
bayonet
out
and
if
you
good
at
it
cried
the
alsatian
you
ought
to
yank
it
out
as
your
boche
falls
and
be
ready
for
the
next
one
the
time
they
gave
me
the
croix
de
guerre
i
got
three
in
succession
just
like
at
drill
oh
i
was
so
sorry
i
had
killed
him
went
on
the
other
frenchman
when
i
went
through
his
pockets
i
found
a
here
it
is
i
have
it
he
pulled
out
a
cracked
and
worn
leather
wallet
from
which
he
took
a
photograph
and
a
bunch
of
pictures
look
this
photograph
was
there
too
it
hurt
my
heart
you
see
it
a
woman
and
two
little
girls
they
look
so
nice
it
strange
but
i
have
two
children
too
only
a
boy
i
lay
down
on
the
ground
beside
him
i
was
all
in
and
listened
to
the
tapping
put
put
put
put
put
all
round
i
wished
i
let
him
kill
me
instead
that
was
funny
was
it
it
idiotic
to
feel
like
that
put
them
to
the
bayonet
all
of
them
the
dirty
boches
why
the
only
money
i
had
since
the
war
began
except
my
five
sous
was
fifty
francs
i
found
on
a
german
officer
i
wonder
where
he
got
it
the
old
oh
it
shameful
i
am
ashamed
of
being
a
man
oh
the
shame
the
shame
the
other
man
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
i
wish
they
were
serving
out
gniolle
for
an
attack
right
now
said
the
alsatian
or
the
gniolle
without
the
attack
be
better
yet
wait
here
said
martin
i
go
round
to
the
copé
and
get
a
bottle
of
fizzy
we
drink
to
peace
or
war
as
you
like
damn
this
rain
it
a
shame
to
bury
those
boots
said
the
sergeant
of
the
from
the
long
roll
of
blanket
on
the
ground
beside
the
grave
protruded
a
pair
of
high
boots
new
and
well
polished
as
if
for
parade
all
about
the
earth
was
scarred
with
turned
clay
like
raw
wounds
and
the
tilting
arms
of
little
wooden
crosses
huddled
together
with
here
and
there
a
bent
wreath
or
a
faded
bunch
of
flowers
overhead
in
the
stripped
trees
a
bird
was
singing
shall
we
take
them
off
it
a
shame
to
bury
a
pair
of
boots
like
that
so
many
poor
devils
need
boots
boots
cost
so
dear
already
two
men
were
lowering
the
long
bundle
into
the
grave
wait
a
minute
we
got
a
coffin
for
him
a
white
board
coffin
was
brought
the
boots
thumped
against
the
bottom
as
they
put
the
big
bundle
in
an
officer
strode
into
the
enclosure
of
the
graveyard
flicking
his
knees
with
a
twig
is
this
lieutenant
dupont
he
asked
of
the
sergeant
yes
my
lieutenant
can
you
see
his
face
the
officer
stooped
and
pulled
apart
the
blanket
where
the
head
was
poor
rené
he
said
thank
you
and
strode
out
of
the
graveyard
the
yellowish
clay
fell
in
clots
on
the
boards
of
the
coffin
the
sergeant
bared
his
head
and
the
aumonier
came
up
opening
his
book
with
a
vaguely
professional
air
it
was
a
shame
to
bury
those
boots
boots
are
so
dear
nowadays
said
the
sergeant
mumbling
to
himself
as
he
walked
back
towards
the
little
broad
shanty
they
used
as
a
morgue
of
the
house
a
little
pale
villa
only
a
shell
remained
but
the
garden
was
quite
untouched
fall
roses
and
bunches
of
white
and
pink
and
violet
phlox
bloomed
there
among
the
long
grass
and
the
intruding
nettles
in
the
centre
the
round
concrete
fountain
was
no
longer
full
of
water
but
a
few
toads
still
inhabited
it
the
place
smelt
of
box
and
sweetbriar
and
yew
and
when
you
lay
down
on
the
grass
where
it
grew
short
under
the
old
yew
tree
by
the
fountain
you
could
see
nothing
but
placid
sky
and
waving
green
leaves
martin
howe
and
tom
randolph
would
spend
there
the
quiet
afternoons
when
they
were
off
duty
sleeping
in
the
languid
sunlight
or
chatting
lazily
pointing
out
to
each
other
tiny
things
the
pattern
of
the
glitter
of
insects
wings
colours
fragrances
that
made
vivid
for
them
suddenly
beauty
and
life
all
that
the
shells
that
shrieked
overhead
to
explode
on
the
road
behind
them
threatened
to
wipe
out
one
afternoon
russell
joined
them
a
tall
young
man
with
thin
face
and
aquiline
nose
and
unexpectedly
light
hair
chef
says
we
may
go
en
repos
in
three
days
he
said
throwing
himself
on
the
ground
beside
the
other
two
we
heard
that
before
said
tom
randolph
division
has
started
out
yet
ole
boy
an
we
the
last
of
the
division
god
i
be
glad
to
go
i
dead
said
russell
i
was
up
all
last
night
with
dysentery
so
was
i
it
was
not
funny
first
it
be
vomiting
and
then
diarrhoea
and
then
the
shells
start
coming
in
gave
me
a
merry
time
of
it
they
say
it
the
gas
said
martin
god
the
gas
turns
me
sick
to
think
of
it
said
russell
stroking
his
forehead
with
his
hand
did
i
tell
you
about
what
happened
to
me
the
night
after
the
attack
up
in
the
woods
no
well
i
was
bringing
a
load
of
wounded
down
from
right
and
i
got
just
beyond
the
corner
where
the
little
muddy
hill
is
you
know
where
they
always
shelling
when
i
found
the
road
blocked
it
was
so
black
you
could
see
your
hand
in
front
of
you
a
gone
off
the
road
and
another
had
run
into
it
and
everything
was
littered
with
boxes
of
shells
spilt
about
must
have
been
real
nice
said
randolph
the
devilish
part
of
it
was
that
i
was
all
alone
coney
was
too
sick
with
diarrhoea
to
be
any
use
so
i
left
him
up
at
the
post
running
out
at
both
ends
like
he
die
well
i
yelled
and
shouted
like
hell
in
my
bad
french
and
blew
my
whistle
and
sweated
and
the
damned
wounded
inside
moaned
and
groaned
and
the
shells
were
coming
in
so
thick
i
thought
my
number
turn
up
any
time
an
i
could
get
anybody
so
i
just
climbed
up
in
the
second
camion
and
backed
it
off
into
the
bushes
god
i
bet
it
take
a
wrecking
crew
to
get
it
out
that
was
one
good
job
but
there
i
was
with
another
square
in
the
road
and
no
chance
to
pass
that
i
could
see
in
that
darkness
then
what
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
happened
i
saw
a
little
bit
of
light
in
a
ditch
beside
a
big
car
that
seemed
to
be
laying
on
its
side
and
i
went
down
to
it
and
there
was
a
bunch
of
camion
drivers
sitting
round
a
lantern
drinking
have
a
drink
they
called
out
to
me
and
one
of
them
got
up
waving
his
arms
ravin
drunk
and
threw
his
arms
around
me
and
kissed
me
on
the
mouth
his
hair
and
beard
were
full
of
wet
mud
then
he
dragged
me
into
the
crowd
here
a
copain
come
to
die
with
us
he
cried
i
gave
him
a
shove
and
he
fell
down
but
another
one
got
up
and
handed
me
a
tin
cup
full
of
that
gniolle
that
i
drank
not
to
make
sore
then
they
all
shouted
and
stood
about
me
sayin
goin
to
die
with
us
he
goin
to
drink
with
us
he
goin
to
die
with
us
and
the
shells
comin
in
all
the
while

was
scared

to
the
side
of
the
road
i
said

they
said
and
made
me
drink
some
more
booze

to
die
with
us

said
so
the
sweat
was
running
into
my
eyes
so
i
could
hardly
see
i
told
i

right
back
and
slipped
away
into
the
dark
then
i
thought

the
second
camion
cranked
at
last
i
managed
it
and
put
it
so
i
could
squeeze
past
but
they
saw
me
and
jumped
up
on
the
of
the
ambulance

to

the
car

yellin
at
once
no

the
road
blocked
both
ways

foot
on

accelerator
and

of
them
so
hard
with
the
mudguard
he

into
the
lantern
and

watching
a
big
dragonfly
with
brown
body
and
cream
and
rainbow
wings
that
hovered
over
the
empty
fountain
and
the
three
boys
stretched
on
the
grass
and
was
gone
against
the
azure
sky
the
prisoner
had
grey
flesh
so
grimed
with
mud
that
you
could
not
tell
if
he
were
young
or
old
his
uniform
hung
in
a
formless
clot
of
mud
about
a
slender
frame
they
had
treated
him
at
the
for
a
gash
in
his
upper
arm
and
he
was
being
used
to
help
the
martin
sat
in
the
front
seat
of
the
ambulance
watching
him
listlessly
as
he
walked
down
the
rutted
road
under
the
torn
shreds
of
camouflage
that
fluttered
a
little
in
the
wind
martin
wondered
what
he
was
thinking
did
he
accept
all
this
stench
and
filth
and
degradation
of
slavery
as
part
of
the
divine
order
of
things
or
did
he
too
burn
with
loathing
and
revolt
and
all
those
men
beyond
the
hill
and
the
wood
what
were
they
thinking
but
how
could
they
think
the
lies
they
were
drunk
on
would
keep
them
eternally
from
thinking
they
had
never
had
any
chance
to
think
until
they
were
hurried
into
the
jaws
of
it
where
was
no
room
but
for
laughter
and
misery
and
the
smell
of
blood
the
rutted
road
was
empty
now
most
of
the
batteries
were
quiet
overhead
in
the
brilliant
sky
aeroplanes
snored
monotonously
the
woods
all
about
him
were
a
vast
the
jagged
splintered
boles
of
leafless
trees
rose
in
every
direction
from
heaps
of
brass
of
tin
cans
of
bits
of
uniform
and
equipment
the
wind
came
in
puffs
laden
with
an
odour
as
of
dead
rats
in
an
attic
and
this
was
what
all
the
centuries
of
civilisation
had
struggled
for
for
this
had
generations
worn
away
their
lives
in
mines
and
factories
and
forges
in
fields
and
workshops
toiling
screwing
higher
and
higher
the
tension
of
their
minds
and
muscles
polishing
brighter
and
brighter
the
mirror
of
their
intelligence
for
this
the
german
prisoner
and
another
man
had
appeared
in
the
road
again
carrying
a
stretcher
between
them
walking
with
the
slow
meticulous
steps
of
great
fatigue
a
series
of
shells
came
in
like
three
cracks
of
a
whip
along
the
road
martin
followed
the
into
the
dugout
the
prisoner
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
and
started
up
the
step
of
the
dugout
again
a
closed
stretcher
on
his
shoulder
something
made
martin
look
after
him
as
he
strolled
down
the
rutted
road
he
wished
he
knew
german
so
that
he
might
call
after
the
man
and
ask
him
what
manner
of
a
man
he
was
again
like
snapping
of
a
whip
three
shells
flashed
yellow
as
they
exploded
in
the
brilliant
sunlight
of
the
road
the
slender
figure
of
the
prisoner
bent
suddenly
double
like
a
closing
and
lay
still
martin
ran
out
stumbling
in
the
hard
ruts
in
a
soft
voice
the
prisoner
was
babbling
endlessly
contentedly
martin
kneeled
beside
him
and
tried
to
lift
him
clasping
him
round
the
chest
under
the
arms
he
was
very
hard
to
lift
for
his
legs
dragged
limply
in
their
soaked
trousers
where
the
blood
was
beginning
to
saturate
the
muddy
cloth
stickily
sweat
dripped
from
martin
face
on
the
man
face
and
he
felt
the
and
the
ribs
pressed
against
his
body
as
he
clutched
the
wounded
man
tightly
to
him
in
the
effort
of
carrying
him
towards
the
dugout
the
effort
gave
martin
a
strange
contentment
it
was
as
if
his
body
were
taking
part
in
the
agony
of
this
man
body
at
last
they
were
washed
out
all
the
hatreds
all
the
lies
in
blood
and
sweat
nothing
was
left
but
the
quiet
friendliness
of
beings
alike
in
every
part
eternally
alike
two
men
with
a
stretcher
came
from
the
dugout
and
martin
laid
the
body
fast
growing
limper
less
animated
down
very
carefully
as
he
stood
by
the
car
wiping
the
blood
off
his
hands
with
an
oily
rag
he
could
still
feel
the
man
ribs
and
the
muscles
of
the
man
arm
against
his
side
it
made
him
strangely
happy
at
the
end
of
the
dugout
a
man
was
drawing
short
hard
breath
as
if
been
running
there
was
the
accustomed
smell
of
blood
and
chloride
and
bandages
and
filthy
miserable
flesh
howe
lay
on
a
stretcher
wrapped
in
his
blanket
with
his
coat
over
him
trying
to
sleep
there
was
very
little
light
from
a
smoky
lamp
down
at
the
end
where
the
wounded
were
the
french
batteries
were
fairly
quiet
but
the
german
shells
were
combing
through
the
woods
coming
in
series
of
three
and
four
gradually
nearing
the
dugout
and
edging
away
again
howe
saw
the
woods
as
a
gambling
table
on
which
throw
after
throw
scattered
the
random
dice
of
death
he
pulled
his
blanket
up
round
his
head
he
must
sleep
how
silly
to
think
about
it
it
was
luck
if
a
shell
had
his
number
on
it
he
be
gone
before
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
how
silly
that
he
might
be
dead
any
minute
what
right
had
a
nasty
little
piece
of
tinware
to
go
tearing
through
his
rich
feeling
flesh
extinguishing
it
like
the
sound
of
a
mosquito
in
his
ear
only
louder
more
vicious
a
shrilled
to
the
crash
damn
how
foolish
how
supremely
silly
that
tired
men
somewhere
away
in
the
woods
the
other
side
of
the
lines
should
be
shoving
a
shell
into
the
breach
of
a
gun
to
kill
him
martin
howe
like
dice
thrown
on
a
table
shells
burst
about
the
dugout
now
one
side
now
the
other
seem
to
have
taken
a
fancy
to
us
this
evenin
howe
heard
tom
randolph
voice
from
the
bunk
opposite
one
muttered
martin
to
himself
as
he
lay
frozen
with
fear
flat
on
his
back
biting
his
trembling
lips
two
god
that
was
near
a
dragging
instant
of
suspense
and
the
shriek
growing
loud
out
of
the
distance
this
is
us
he
clutched
the
sides
of
the
stretcher
a
snorting
roar
rocked
the
dugout
dirt
fell
in
his
face
he
looked
about
dazed
the
lamp
was
still
burning
one
of
the
wounded
men
with
a
bandage
like
an
arab
turban
about
his
head
sat
up
in
his
stretcher
with
wide
terrified
eyes
god
watches
over
drunkards
and
the
do
let
worry
howe
shouted
randolph
from
his
bunk
that
probably
bitched
car
no
for
evermore
he
answered
turning
on
his
stretcher
relieved
for
some
reason
from
the
icy
suspense
we
should
worry
we
foot
it
home
that
all
the
casting
of
the
dice
began
again
farther
away
this
time
we
won
that
throw
thought
martin
chapter
viii
ducks
quacking
woke
martin
for
a
moment
he
could
not
think
where
he
was
then
he
remembered
the
rafters
of
the
loft
of
the
farmhouse
over
his
head
were
hung
with
bunches
of
herbs
drying
he
lay
a
long
while
on
his
back
looking
at
them
sniffing
the
sweetened
air
while
farmyard
sounds
occupied
his
ears
hens
cackling
the
grunting
of
pigs
the
of
pigeons
under
the
eaves
he
stretched
himself
and
looked
about
him
he
was
alone
except
for
tom
randolph
who
slept
in
a
pile
of
blankets
next
to
the
wall
his
head
with
its
black
hair
pillowed
on
his
bare
arm
martin
slipped
off
the
canvas
cot
he
had
slept
on
and
went
to
the
window
of
the
loft
a
little
square
open
at
the
level
of
the
floor
through
which
came
a
dazzle
of
blue
and
gold
and
green
he
looked
out
stables
and
filled
two
sides
of
the
farmyard
below
him
behind
them
was
a
mass
of
rustling
on
the
tile
roofs
pigeons
strutted
about
putting
their
coral
feet
daintily
one
before
the
other
puffing
out
their
glittering
breasts
he
breathed
deep
of
the
smell
of
hay
and
manure
and
cows
and
of
unpolluted
farms
from
the
yard
came
a
riotous
cackling
of
chickens
and
quacking
of
ducks
mingled
with
the
peeping
of
the
little
broods
in
the
middle
a
girl
in
blue
gingham
sleeves
rolled
up
as
far
as
possible
on
her
brown
arms
a
girl
with
a
mass
of
dark
hair
loosely
coiled
above
the
nape
of
her
neck
was
throwing
to
the
fowls
handfuls
of
grain
with
a
wide
gesture
and
to
think
that
only
yesterday
said
martin
to
himself
he
listened
carefully
for
some
time
wonderful
you
ca
even
hear
the
guns
chapter
ix
the
evening
was
when
they
left
the
village
in
their
nostrils
was
the
smell
of
the
leisurely
death
of
the
year
of
leaves
drying
and
falling
of
ripened
fruit
and
bursting
the
fall
a
maddening
sort
o
time
for
me
said
tom
randolph
it
makes
me
itch
to
get
up
on
ma
hind
legs
an
do
things
go
places
i
suppose
it
that
the
earth
has
such
a
feel
of
accomplishment
said
howe
you
do
feel
as
if
nature
had
pulled
off
her
part
of
the
job
and
was
restin
they
stopped
a
second
and
looked
about
them
breathing
deep
on
one
side
of
the
road
were
woods
where
in
long
alleys
the
mists
deepened
into
purple
darkness
there
the
moon
god
it
looks
like
a
pumpkin
i
wish
those
guns
shut
up
off
there
to
the
north
they
sort
of
irrelevant
are
they
they
walked
on
silent
listening
to
the
guns
throbbing
far
away
like
muffled
drums
beaten
in
nervous
haste
sounds
almost
like
a
barrage
martin
for
some
reason
was
thinking
of
the
last
verses
of
he
wished
he
knew
them
so
that
he
could
recite
them
and
empires
gleam
like
wrecks
in
a
dissolving
the
purple
trunks
of
saplings
passed
slowly
across
the
broad
face
of
the
moon
as
they
walked
along
how
beautiful
the
world
was
look
tom
martin
put
his
arm
about
randolph
shoulder
and
nodded
towards
the
moon
it
might
be
a
ship
with
sails
the
way
the
trees
make
it
look
now
would
it
be
great
to
go
to
sea
said
randolph
looking
straight
into
the
moon
an
get
out
of
this
it
nice
to
see
the
war
but
i
have
no
intention
of
taking
up
butchery
as
a
profession
there
is
too
much
else
to
do
in
the
world
they
walked
slowly
along
the
road
talking
of
the
sea
and
martin
told
how
when
he
was
a
little
kid
he
had
an
uncle
who
used
to
tell
him
about
the
vikings
and
the
swan
path
and
how
one
of
the
great
moments
of
his
life
had
been
when
he
and
a
friend
had
looked
out
of
their
window
in
a
little
inn
on
cape
cod
one
morning
and
seen
the
sea
and
the
swaying
gold
path
of
the
sun
on
it
stretching
away
beyond
the
horizon
poor
old
life
he
said
i
expected
to
do
so
much
with
you
and
they
both
laughed
a
little
bitterly
they
were
strolling
past
a
large
farmhouse
that
stood
like
a
hen
among
chicks
in
a
crowd
of
little
outbuildings
a
man
in
the
road
lit
a
cigarette
and
martin
recognised
him
in
the
orange
glare
of
the
match
monsieur
merrier
he
held
out
his
hand
it
was
the
aspirant
he
had
drunk
beer
with
weeks
ago
at
brocourt
hah
it
you
so
you
are
en
repos
here
too
yes
indeed
but
you
two
come
in
and
see
us
we
are
dying
of
the
blues
we
love
to
stop
in
for
a
second
a
fire
smouldered
in
the
big
hearth
of
the
farmhouse
kitchen
sending
a
little
irregular
fringe
of
red
light
out
over
the
tiled
floor
at
the
end
of
the
room
towards
the
door
three
men
were
seated
round
a
table
smoking
a
candle
threw
their
huge
and
grotesque
shadows
on
the
floor
and
on
the
whitewashed
walls
and
lit
up
the
dark
beams
of
that
part
of
the
ceiling
the
three
men
got
up
and
everyone
shook
hands
filling
the
room
with
swaying
giant
shadows
champagne
was
brought
and
tin
cups
and
more
candles
and
the
americans
were
given
the
two
most
comfortable
chairs
it
such
a
find
to
have
americans
who
speak
french
said
a
bearded
man
with
unusually
large
brilliant
eyes
he
had
been
introduced
as
andré
dubois
a
very
terrible
person
had
added
merrier
laughing
the
cork
popped
out
of
the
bottle
he
had
been
struggling
with
you
see
we
never
can
find
out
what
you
think
about
things
all
we
can
do
is
to
be
sympathetically
inane
and
les
braves
and
that
sort
of
stuff
i
doubt
if
we
americans
do
think
said
martin
cigarettes
who
wants
some
cigarettes
cried
lully
a
small
man
with
a
very
brown
oval
face
to
which
long
eyelashes
and
a
little
bit
of
silky
black
moustache
gave
almost
a
winsomeness
when
he
laughed
he
showed
brilliant
very
regular
teeth
as
he
handed
the
cigarettes
about
he
looked
searchingly
at
martin
with
eyes
disconcertingly
intense
merrier
has
told
us
about
you
he
said
you
seem
to
be
the
first
american
we
met
who
agreed
with
us
what
about
about
the
war
of
course
yes
took
up
the
fourth
man
a
blonde
norman
with
an
impressive
rather
majestic
face
we
were
very
interested
you
see
we
bore
each
other
talking
always
among
ourselves
i
hope
you
wo
be
offended
if
i
agree
with
you
in
saying
that
americans
never
think
i
been
in
texas
you
see
really
yes
i
went
to
a
jesuit
college
in
dallas
i
was
preparing
to
enter
the
society
of
jesus
how
long
have
you
been
in
the
war
asked
andré
dubois
passing
his
hand
across
his
beard
we
both
been
in
the
same
length
of
time
about
six
months
do
you
like
it
i
do
have
a
bad
time
but
the
people
in
boccaccio
managed
to
enjoy
themselves
while
the
plague
was
at
florence
that
seems
to
me
the
only
way
to
take
the
war
we
have
no
villa
to
take
refuge
in
though
said
dubois
and
we
have
forgotten
all
our
amusing
stories
and
in
america
they
like
the
war
they
do
know
what
it
is
they
are
like
children
they
believe
everything
they
are
told
you
see
they
have
had
no
experience
in
international
affairs
like
you
europeans
to
me
our
entrance
into
the
war
is
a
tragedy
it
sort
of
goin
back
on
our
only
excuse
for
existing
put
in
randolph
in
exchange
for
all
the
quiet
and
the
civilisation
and
the
beauty
of
ordered
lives
that
europeans
gave
up
in
going
to
the
new
world
we
gave
them
opportunity
to
earn
luxury
and
infinitely
more
important
freedom
from
the
past
that
gangrened
ghost
of
the
past
that
is
killing
europe
with
its
infection
of
hate
and
greed
of
murder
america
has
turned
traitor
to
all
that
you
see
that
the
way
we
look
at
it
now
we
a
military
nation
an
organised
pirate
like
france
and
england
and
germany
but
american
idealism
the
speeches
the
notes
cried
lully
catching
the
edge
of
the
table
with
his
two
brown
hands
camouflage
said
martin
you
mean
it
insincere
the
best
camouflage
is
always
sincere
dubois
ran
his
hands
through
his
hair
of
course
why
should
there
be
any
difference
he
said
oh
we
all
dupes
we
all
dupes
look
lully
old
man
fill
up
the
americans
glasses
thanks
and
i
used
to
believe
in
liberty
said
martin
he
raised
his
tumbler
and
looked
at
the
candle
through
the
pale
yellow
champagne
on
the
wall
behind
him
his
arm
and
hand
and
the
tumbler
were
shadowed
huge
in
dusky
lavender
blue
he
noticed
that
his
was
the
only
tumbler
i
am
honoured
he
said
mine
is
the
only
glass
and
that
looted
said
merrier
it
funny
martin
suddenly
felt
himself
filled
with
a
desire
to
talk
all
my
life
i
struggled
for
my
own
liberty
in
my
small
way
now
i
hardly
know
if
the
thing
exists
exists
of
course
it
does
or
people
would
hate
it
so
cried
lully
i
used
to
think
went
on
martin
that
it
was
my
family
i
must
escape
from
to
be
free
i
mean
all
the
conventional
ties
the
worship
of
success
and
the
respectabilities
that
is
drummed
into
you
when
young
i
suppose
everyone
has
thought
that
how
stupid
we
were
before
the
war
how
we
prated
of
small
revolts
how
we
sniggered
over
little
jokes
at
religion
and
government
and
all
the
while
in
the
infinite
greed
in
the
infinite
stupidity
of
men
this
was
being
prepared
andré
dubois
was
speaking
puffing
nervously
at
a
cigarette
between
phrases
now
and
then
pulling
at
his
beard
with
a
long
sinewy
hand
what
terrifies
me
rather
is
their
power
to
enslave
our
minds
martin
went
on
his
voice
growing
louder
and
surer
as
his
idea
carried
him
along
i
shall
never
forget
the
flags
the
menacing
exultant
flags
along
all
the
streets
before
we
went
to
war
the
gradual
unbaring
of
teeth
gradual
lulling
to
sleep
of
people
humanity
and
sense
by
the
phrases
the
phrases
america
as
you
know
is
ruled
by
the
press
and
the
press
is
ruled
by
whom
who
shall
ever
know
what
dark
forces
bought
and
bought
until
we
should
be
ready
to
go
blinded
and
gagged
to
war
people
seem
to
so
love
to
be
fooled
intellect
used
to
mean
freedom
a
light
struggling
against
darkness
now
the
darkness
is
using
the
light
for
its
own
purposes
we
are
slaves
of
bought
intellect
willing
slaves
but
howe
the
minute
you
see
that
and
laugh
at
it
you
not
a
slave
laugh
and
be
individually
as
decent
as
you
can
and
do
worry
your
head
about
the
rest
of
the
world
and
have
a
good
time
in
spite
of
the
scoundrels
broke
out
randolph
in
english
no
use
worrying
yourself
into
the
grave
over
a
thing
you
ca
help
there
is
one
solution
and
one
only
my
friends
said
the
blonde
norman
the
church
he
sat
up
straight
in
his
chair
speaking
slowly
with
expressionless
face
people
are
too
weak
and
too
kindly
to
shift
for
themselves
government
of
some
sort
there
must
be
lay
government
has
proved
through
all
the
tragic
years
of
history
to
be
merely
a
ruse
of
the
strong
to
oppress
the
weak
of
the
wicked
to
fool
the
confiding
there
remains
only
religion
in
the
organisation
of
religion
lies
the
natural
and
suitable
arrangement
for
the
happiness
of
man
the
church
will
govern
not
through
physical
force
but
through
spiritual
force
the
force
of
fear
lully
jumped
to
his
feet
impatiently
making
the
bottles
sway
on
the
table
the
force
of
love
i
once
thought
as
you
do
my
friend
said
the
norman
pulling
lully
back
into
his
chair
with
a
smile
lully
drank
a
glass
of
champagne
greedily
and
undid
the
buttons
of
his
blue
jacket
go
on
he
said
it
madness
all
the
evil
of
the
church
went
on
the
norman
even
voice
comes
from
her
struggles
to
attain
supremacy
once
assured
of
triumph
established
as
the
rule
of
the
world
it
becomes
the
natural
channel
through
which
the
wise
rule
and
direct
the
stupid
not
for
their
own
interest
not
for
ambition
for
worldly
things
but
for
the
love
that
is
in
them
the
freedom
the
church
offers
is
the
only
true
freedom
it
denies
the
world
and
the
slaveries
and
rewards
of
it
it
gives
the
love
of
god
as
the
only
aim
of
life
but
think
of
the
church
the
cardinals
at
rome
the
church
turned
everywhere
to
the
worship
of
tribal
gods
yes
but
admit
that
that
can
be
changed
the
church
has
been
supreme
in
the
past
can
it
not
again
be
supreme
all
the
evil
comes
from
the
struggle
from
the
compromise
picture
to
yourself
for
a
moment
a
world
conquered
by
the
church
ruled
through
the
soul
and
mind
where
force
will
not
exist
where
instead
of
all
the
multitudinous
tyrannies
man
has
choked
his
life
with
in
organising
against
other
men
will
exist
the
one
supreme
thing
the
church
of
god
instead
of
many
hatreds
one
love
instead
of
many
slaveries
one
freedom
a
single
tyranny
instead
of
a
million
what
the
choice
cried
lully
but
you
are
both
violent
my
children
merrier
got
to
his
feet
and
smilingly
filled
the
glasses
all
round
you
go
at
the
matter
too
much
from
the
heroic
point
of
view
all
this
sermonising
does
no
good
we
are
very
simple
people
who
want
to
live
quietly
and
have
plenty
to
eat
and
have
no
one
worry
us
or
hurt
us
in
the
little
span
of
sunlight
before
we
die
all
we
have
now
is
the
same
war
between
the
classes
those
that
exploit
and
those
that
are
exploited
the
cunning
unscrupulous
people
control
the
humane
kindly
people
this
war
that
has
smashed
our
little
european
world
in
which
order
was
so
painfully
taking
the
place
of
chaos
seems
to
me
merely
a
gigantic
battle
fought
over
the
plunder
of
the
world
by
the
pirates
who
have
grown
fat
to
the
point
of
madness
on
the
work
of
their
own
people
on
the
work
of
the
millions
in
africa
in
india
in
america
who
have
come
directly
or
indirectly
under
the
yoke
of
the
insane
greed
of
the
white
races
well
our
edifice
is
ruined
let
think
no
more
of
it
ours
is
now
the
duty
of
rebuilding
reorganising
i
have
not
faith
enough
in
human
nature
to
be
an
anarchist
we
are
too
like
sheep
we
must
go
in
flocks
and
a
flock
to
live
must
organise
there
is
plenty
for
everyone
even
with
the
huge
growth
in
population
all
over
the
world
what
we
want
is
organisation
from
the
bottom
organisation
by
the
ungreedy
by
the
humane
by
the
uncunning
socialism
of
the
masses
that
shall
spring
from
the
natural
need
of
men
to
help
one
another
not
socialism
from
the
top
to
the
ends
of
the
governors
that
they
may
clamp
us
tighter
in
their
fetters
we
must
stop
the
economic
war
the
war
for
existence
of
man
against
man
that
will
be
the
first
step
in
the
long
climb
to
civilisation
they
must
they
must
learn
that
it
is
saner
and
more
advantageous
to
help
one
another
than
to
hinder
one
another
in
the
great
war
against
nature
and
the
tyranny
of
the
feudal
money
lords
the
unspeakable
misery
of
this
war
is
driving
men
closer
together
into
fraternity
it
is
the
lower
classes
therefore
that
the
new
world
must
be
founded
on
the
rich
must
be
extinguished
with
them
wars
will
die
first
between
rich
and
poor
between
the
exploiter
and
the
exploited
they
have
one
thing
in
common
interrupted
the
blonde
norman
smiling
what
that
humanity
that
is
feebleness
cowardice
no
indeed
all
through
the
world
history
there
has
been
one
law
for
the
lord
and
another
for
the
slave
one
humanity
for
the
lord
and
another
humanity
for
the
slave
what
we
must
strive
for
is
a
true
universal
humanity
true
cried
lully
but
why
take
the
longest
the
most
difficult
road
you
say
that
people
are
sheep
they
must
be
driven
i
say
that
you
and
i
and
our
american
friends
here
are
not
sheep
we
are
capable
of
standing
alone
of
judging
all
for
ourselves
and
we
are
just
ordinary
people
like
anyone
else
oh
but
look
at
us
lully
interrupted
merrier
we
are
too
weak
and
too
cowardly
an
example
said
martin
excitedly
leaning
across
the
table
we
none
of
us
believe
that
war
is
right
or
useful
or
anything
but
a
hideous
method
of
mutual
suicide
have
we
the
courage
of
our
own
faith
as
i
said
merrier
took
up
again
i
have
too
little
faith
to
be
an
anarchist
but
i
have
too
much
to
believe
in
religion
his
tin
cup
rapped
sharply
on
the
table
as
he
set
it
down
no
lully
continued
after
a
pause
it
is
better
for
man
to
worship
god
his
image
on
the
clouds
the
creation
of
his
fancy
than
to
worship
the
vulgar
apparatus
of
organised
life
government
better
sacrifice
his
children
to
moloch
than
to
that
society
for
the
propagation
and
protection
of
commerce
the
nation
oh
think
of
the
cost
of
government
in
all
the
ages
since
men
stopped
living
in
marauding
tribes
think
of
the
great
men
martyred
think
of
the
thought
trodden
into
the
dust
give
man
a
chance
for
once
government
should
be
purely
utilitarian
like
the
electric
light
wires
in
a
house
it
is
a
method
for
attaining
peace
and
comfort
a
bad
one
i
think
at
that
not
a
thing
to
be
worshipped
as
god
the
one
reason
for
it
is
the
protection
of
property
why
should
we
have
property
that
is
the
central
evil
of
the
world
that
is
the
cancer
that
has
made
life
a
hell
of
misery
until
now
the
inflated
greed
of
it
has
spurred
on
our
nations
of
the
west
to
throw
themselves
back
for
ever
perhaps
into
the
depths
of
savagery
oh
if
people
would
only
trust
their
own
fundamental
kindliness
the
fraternity
the
love
that
is
the
strongest
thing
in
life
abolish
property
and
the
disease
of
the
desire
for
it
the
desire
to
grasp
and
have
and
you
need
no
government
to
protect
you
the
vividness
and
resiliency
of
the
life
of
man
is
being
fast
crushed
under
organisation
tabulation
is
death
it
is
disorganisation
not
organisation
that
is
the
aim
of
life
i
grant
that
what
all
of
you
say
is
true
but
why
say
it
over
and
over
again
andré
dubois
talked
striding
back
and
forth
beside
the
table
his
arms
gesticulating
his
compound
shadow
thrown
by
the
candles
on
the
white
wall
followed
him
back
and
forth
mocking
him
with
huge
blurred
gestures
the
greek
philosophers
said
it
and
the
indian
sages
our
descendants
thousands
of
years
from
now
will
say
it
and
wring
their
hands
as
we
do
has
not
someone
on
earth
the
courage
to
act
the
men
at
the
table
turned
towards
him
watching
his
tall
figure
move
back
and
forth
we
are
slaves
we
are
blind
we
are
deaf
why
should
we
argue
we
who
have
no
experience
of
different
things
to
go
on
it
has
always
been
the
same
man
the
slave
of
property
or
religion
of
his
own
shadow
first
we
must
burst
our
bonds
open
our
eyes
clear
our
ears
now
we
know
nothing
but
what
we
are
told
by
the
rulers
oh
the
lies
the
lies
the
lies
the
lies
that
life
is
smothered
in
we
must
strike
once
more
for
freedom
for
the
sake
of
the
dignity
of
man
hopelessly
cynically
ruthlessly
we
must
rise
and
show
at
least
that
we
are
not
taken
in
that
we
are
slaves
but
not
willing
slaves
oh
they
have
deceived
us
so
many
times
we
have
been
such
dupes
we
have
been
such
dupes
you
are
right
said
the
blonde
norman
sullenly
we
have
all
been
dupes
a
sudden
chilled
them
all
to
silence
for
a
while
without
wanting
to
they
strained
their
ears
to
hear
the
guns
there
they
were
throbbing
loud
unceasing
towards
the
north
like
hasty
muffled
drain
not
to
its
dregs
the
wine
of
bitter
prophecy
the
world
is
weary
of
its
past
oh
might
it
die
or
rest
at
all
through
the
talk
snatches
from
had
been
running
through
howe
head
after
a
long
pause
he
turned
to
merrier
and
asked
him
how
he
had
fared
in
the
attack
oh
not
so
badly
i
brought
my
skin
back
said
merrier
laughing
it
was
a
dull
business
after
waiting
eight
hours
under
gas
bombardment
we
got
orders
to
advance
and
so
over
we
went
with
the
barrage
way
ahead
of
us
there
was
no
resistance
where
we
were
we
took
a
lot
of
prisoners
and
blew
up
some
dugouts
and
i
had
the
good
luck
to
find
a
lot
of
german
chocolate
it
came
in
handy
i
can
tell
you
as
no
ravitaillement
came
for
two
days
we
just
had
biscuits
and
i
toasted
the
biscuits
and
chocolate
together
and
had
quite
good
meals
though
i
nearly
died
of
thirst
afterwards
we
lost
heavily
though
when
they
started
an
no
one
of
you
were
touched
luck
but
we
lost
many
dear
friends
oh
it
always
like
that
look
what
i
brought
back
a
german
gun
said
andré
dubois
going
to
the
corner
of
the
room
that
some
souvenir
said
tom
randolph
sitting
up
suddenly
shaking
himself
out
of
the
reverie
he
had
been
sunk
in
all
through
the
talk
of
the
evening
and
i
have
three
hundred
rounds
they
come
in
handy
some
day
when
in
the
revolution
after
the
war
that
the
stuff
i
like
to
hear
cried
randolph
getting
to
his
feet
why
wait
for
the
war
to
end
why
because
we
have
not
the
courage
but
it
is
impossible
until
after
the
war
and
then
you
think
it
is
possible
yes
will
it
accomplish
anything
god
knows
one
last
bottle
of
champagne
cried
merrier
they
seated
themselves
round
the
table
again
martin
took
in
at
a
glance
the
eager
sunburned
faces
the
eyes
burning
with
hope
with
determination
and
a
sudden
joy
flared
through
him
oh
there
is
hope
he
said
drinking
down
his
glass
we
are
too
young
too
needed
to
fail
we
must
find
a
way
find
the
first
step
of
a
way
to
freedom
or
life
is
a
hollow
mockery
to
revolution
to
anarchy
to
the
socialist
state
they
all
cried
drinking
down
the
last
of
the
champagne
all
the
candles
but
one
had
guttered
out
their
shadows
swayed
and
darted
in
long
arms
and
changing
grotesque
limbs
about
the
room
but
first
there
must
be
peace
said
the
norman
jean
chenier
twisting
his
mouth
into
a
faintly
bitter
smile
oh
indeed
there
must
be
peace
of
all
slaveries
the
slavery
of
war
of
armies
is
the
bitterest
the
most
hopeless
slavery
lully
was
speaking
his
smooth
brown
face
in
a
grimace
of
excitement
and
loathing
war
is
our
first
enemy
but
oh
my
friend
said
merrier
we
will
win
in
the
end
all
the
people
in
all
the
armies
of
the
world
believe
as
we
do
in
all
the
minds
the
seed
is
sprouting
before
long
the
day
will
come
the
tocsin
will
ring
do
you
really
believe
that
cried
martin
have
we
the
courage
have
we
the
energy
have
we
the
power
are
we
the
men
our
ancestors
were
no
said
dubois
crashing
down
on
the
table
with
his
fist
we
are
merely
intellectuals
we
cling
to
a
mummified
world
but
they
have
the
power
and
the
nerve
who
the
stupid
average
we
only
can
combat
the
lies
said
lully
they
are
so
easily
duped
after
the
war
that
is
what
we
must
do
oh
but
we
are
all
such
dupes
cried
dubois
first
we
must
fight
the
lies
it
is
the
lies
that
choke
us
it
was
very
late
howe
and
tom
randolph
were
walking
home
under
a
cold
white
moon
already
well
sunk
in
the
west
northward
was
a
little
flickering
glare
above
the
tops
of
the
low
hills
and
a
sound
of
firing
as
of
muffled
drums
beaten
hastily
with
people
like
that
we
need
despair
of
civilisation
said
howe
with
people
who
are
young
and
are
scared
you
can
do
lots
we
must
come
over
and
see
those
fellows
again
it
such
a
relief
to
be
able
to
talk
and
they
give
you
the
idea
that
something
really
going
on
in
the
world
do
they
oh
it
wonderful
think
that
the
awakening
may
come
soon
we
might
wake
up
and
it
too
important
to
joke
about
do
be
an
ass
tom
they
rolled
up
in
their
blankets
in
the
silent
barn
and
listened
to
the
in
the
distance
martin
saw
again
as
he
lay
on
his
side
with
his
eyes
closed
the
group
of
men
in
blue
uniforms
men
with
eager
brown
faces
and
eyes
gleaming
with
hope
and
saw
their
full
red
lips
moving
as
they
talked
the
candle
threw
the
shadows
of
their
heads
huge
fantastic
and
of
their
gesticulating
arms
on
the
white
walls
of
the
kitchen
and
it
seemed
to
martin
howe
that
all
his
friends
were
gathered
in
that
room
chapter
x
they
say
you
sell
said
martin
his
eyes
blinking
in
the
faint
candlelight
crouched
in
the
end
of
the
dugout
was
a
man
with
a
brown
skin
like
wrinkled
leather
and
white
eyebrows
and
moustaches
all
about
him
were
piles
of
old
boots
rotten
with
wear
and
mud
holding
fantastically
the
imprints
of
the
toes
and
of
the
feet
that
had
worn
them
the
candle
cast
flitting
shadows
over
them
so
that
they
seemed
to
move
back

that
hung
from
a
beam

worn
sole
at
the
little
hut
where
they
pile
up
the
stiffs
before
they
bury
them

leather
in
a
spiral

off

contracted
his
bushy
eyebrows
as
he
bent
over
his
work
the
candlelight
glinted
on
the

twisted

walked
past
men
sleeping
in
the
bunks
on
either
side
as
he
went
towards
the
steps
at
the
end
of
the
dugout
the
man
crouched
on
his
pile
of
old
leather
with
his
knife

glinted
in
the

martin
is
kneeling
beside
a
stretcher
where
lies
a
mass
of
torn
blue
uniform
crossed
in
several
places
by
strips
of
white
bandages
clotted
with

the

grimed
with

waxy

the
light
hair
hangs
in
clots
about
the

the
nose
is
sharp

there
is
a

about
the
lips
made
thin

is
there
anything

martin

the

and
you

we
must
be
cheerful
it
not

the

slip

over
the

the
