chapter
i
sweet
lily
lawrence
had
committed
oh
impossible
a
girl
so
young
so
gifted
so
lovely
the
darling
of
her
father
heart
the
idol
of
her
brilliant
lover
the
heiress
of
a
splendid
fortune
what
had
she
to
do
with
the
grim
king
of
terrors
death
to
her
was
an
enemy
to
be
shunned
and
dreaded
rather
than
a
lover
to
be
courted
and
was
her
bridal
day
yet
there
she
lay
prone
on
the
velvet
carpet
with
its
delicate
pattern
of
myosotis
and
the
soft
light
of
the
june
morning
shining
through
the
open
window
on
the
still
form
robed
in
creamy
white
satin
and
priceless
lace
the
fair
hair
streaming
across
the
floor
the
turquoise
blue
eyes
with
a
look
of
unutterable
horror
frozen
in
their
upward
stare
the
small
and
dimpled
white
hand
clinching
tightly
a
tiny
jeweled
dagger
whose
murderous
thrust
had
left
a
ghastly
gory
crimson
stain
on
the
snowy
satin
lace
above
her
heart
by
that
crimson
stain
death
claimed
her
for
his
own
the
fairest
bride
the
grim
monarch
ever
took
to
his
icy
arms
a
thrill
of
universal
horror
ran
through
the
great
city
where
she
had
been
known
and
loved
not
more
for
her
beauty
and
wealth
than
for
her
sweet
and
gentle
character
friends
came
and
went
through
the
portals
of
banker
lawrence
splendid
brown
stone
mansion
on
fifth
avenue
for
a
sight
of
the
beautiful
suicide
who
had
been
expected
to
appear
so
soon
as
a
happy
bride
lawrence
the
bereaved
and
sorely
stricken
father
appeared
like
one
dazed
with
grief
and
horror
ada
his
younger
and
only
remaining
daughter
was
confined
to
her
room
in
strong
hysterics
attended
by
the
maids
vance
the
beautiful
widow
of
a
second
cousin
of
lawrence
a
lady
who
made
her
home
at
the
banker
was
the
only
one
in
the
house
who
retained
sufficient
calmness
to
attend
to
anything
at
all
it
was
she
who
kept
back
the
curious
throng
of
the
who
would
fain
have
invaded
the
mansion
it
was
she
who
talked
with
sympathizing
friends
breaking
now
and
then
into
a
sob
and
hiding
her
eyes
in
her
damp
lace
handkerchief
oh
doctor
she
cried
as
the
physician
who
had
been
hastily
summoned
after
the
shocking
discovery
bent
over
the
pale
form
trying
to
see
if
any
spark
of
life
remained
oh
doctor
she
is
not
really
dead
is
she
surely
our
darling
lily
is
not
gone
from
us
forever
the
physician
looked
up
curiously
at
the
dark
beautiful
face
of
the
speaker
now
convulsed
with
grief
and
horror
he
bent
again
over
the
recumbent
form
closely
examining
the
beautiful
white
features
of
the
girl
touched
her
felt
her
tightly
clenched
hands
carefully
and
laid
his
ear
over
the
still
breast
whose
crimson
blood
had
stiffened
the
bridal
robe
above
the
tender
heart
so
lately
bounding
with
the
joyous
pulses
of
youth
and
hope
and
perfect
happiness
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
answered
rising
and
looking
down
with
a
pale
face
and
trembling
hands
that
miss
lawrence
is
indeed
no
more
life
has
been
extinct
for
hours
a
few
hours
later
a
coroner
inquest
was
held
over
the
remains
vance
miss
ada
lawrence
and
the
deceased
girl
were
the
three
who
had
seen
lily
lawrence
last
in
life
their
testimony
was
accordingly
taken
the
maid
deposed
that
on
the
night
on
which
the
fatal
event
had
transpired
her
mistress
had
kept
her
in
her
room
until
about
eleven
for
the
purpose
of
making
some
trifling
alterations
in
the
fit
of
the
elegant
white
satin
bridal
robe
while
thus
engaged
miss
ada
lawrence
and
vance
had
come
in
for
a
chat
with
miss
lawrence
miss
ada
a
young
and
fond
of
finery
had
persuaded
her
sister
to
don
the
beautiful
dress
and
veil
after
staying
awhile
and
admiring
the
loveliness
of
miss
lawrence
the
maid
had
been
dismissed
her
young
mistress
saying
that
she
would
herself
remove
the
dress
having
already
laid
aside
the
veil
and
wreath
of
orange
blossoms
she
the
maid
had
accordingly
bidden
the
ladies
the
next
morning
as
usual
she
had
gone
at
eight
to
call
her
young
mistress
she
had
found
the
door
locked
on
the
inside
in
response
to
repeated
knocks
and
calls
no
answer
had
been
elicited
and
becoming
frightened
she
had
repeated
the
fact
to
the
family
who
were
just
assembling
at
breakfast
lawrence
had
caused
the
door
to
be
forced
immediately
on
entering
they
had
found
miss
lawrence
lying
dead
upon
the
floor
arrayed
in
her
bridal
dress
and
clutching
in
her
right
hand
a
small
jeweled
dagger
she
was
asked
here
by
the
coroner
if
the
dagger
had
belonged
to
miss
lawrence
she
answered
in
the
affirmative
saying
that
vance
had
presented
it
to
her
a
few
days
before
as
a
bridal
present
and
that
it
had
lain
on
the
ever
since
as
an
ornament
being
asked
why
they
had
supposed
it
to
be
suicide
instead
of
murder
the
affectionate
girl
burst
into
tears
and
replied
that
her
sweet
young
mistress
had
not
an
enemy
on
earth
so
that
no
one
could
have
murdered
her
for
malice
and
that
none
of
her
splendid
jewelry
or
bridal
presents
had
been
touched
so
that
no
one
could
have
murdered
her
for
gain
and
that
the
natural
inference
was
that
miss
lawrence
had
taken
her
own
life
with
her
own
weapon
the
young
lady
had
seemed
much
as
usual
in
her
manner
when
she
last
saw
her
had
betrayed
no
undue
agitation
of
mind
and
was
only
anxious
about
the
fit
of
the
bridal
robe
in
which
she
was
to
appear
on
the
morrow
the
maid
was
suffered
to
leave
the
stand
on
which
miss
ada
lawrence
dreadfully
nervous
and
agitated
was
led
in
and
took
her
place
her
testimony
was
merely
a
corroboration
of
the
maid
she
had
left
the
room
in
vance
company
shortly
after
the
maid
dismissal
both
had
kissed
her
and
left
her
standing
at
the
mirror
smiling
at
her
lovely
reflection
lily
had
seemed
in
good
health
and
spirits
she
did
not
know
of
any
reason
for
her
sister
committing
suicide
but
as
she
had
no
enemies
and
nothing
had
been
touched
in
the
room
it
was
the
natural
inference
she
had
not
seen
her
sister
again
until
the
next
morning
when
she
lay
cold
and
dead
in
the
middle
of
her
room
vance
gave
substantially
the
same
testimony
with
the
addition
that
she
had
heard
miss
lawrence
lock
her
room
door
after
their
departure
she
knew
of
no
cause
that
could
have
driven
the
young
girl
to
take
her
own
life
for
a
few
months
past
she
had
noticed
that
lily
had
strange
fits
of
depression
and
abstraction
she
had
thought
then
that
some
secret
sorrow
preyed
on
the
mind
of
her
cousin
but
she
did
not
know
of
what
nature
she
was
suffered
to
retire
her
agitation
growing
uncontrollable
while
many
admiring
glances
followed
her
graceful
form
as
she
swept
from
the
room
pratt
was
next
called
to
the
stand
he
was
a
tall
dark
man
with
restless
black
eyes
and
nervous
manner
he
gave
his
testimony
briefly
and
to
the
point
he
was
not
lawrence
family
physician
he
was
riding
past
the
house
on
his
way
to
visit
a
patient
when
he
had
been
suddenly
called
in
by
the
summons
of
a
domestic
who
rushed
frantically
into
the
street
after
him
he
had
gone
into
miss
lawrence
room
where
he
found
the
family
assembled
and
indulging
in
the
wildest
grief
the
young
lay
dead
upon
the
floor
grasping
a
small
dagger
in
her
right
hand
upon
examination
he
found
that
life
had
been
extinct
for
eight
or
nine
hours
he
thought
that
death
must
have
been
instantaneous
with
the
from
the
pose
of
the
body
and
the
position
of
the
right
arm
and
hand
together
with
the
direction
of
the
deadly
weapon
all
the
probabilities
pointed
to
an
act
of
a
few
more
witnesses
were
examined
but
nothing
new
was
elicited
and
the
jury
retired
to
consult
the
verdict
was
given
to
the
effect
that
miss
lawrence
came
to
her
death
by
a
inflicted
by
her
own
hand
probably
under
a
temporary
aberration
of
mind
chapter
ii
doctor
pratt
attended
the
funeral
of
miss
lawrence
looking
grave
and
sad
and
dignified
as
the
mournful
occasion
demanded
his
restless
eyes
took
in
every
detail
noted
the
grief
of
the
mourners
and
friends
peered
beneath
the
heavy
crape
veil
of
handsome
vance
noted
the
absence
of
the
bereaved
he
even
entered
the
gloomy
vault
and
stood
by
the
open
coffin
among
the
friends
who
were
taking
their
last
look
at
the
pallid
features
of
the
beautiful
suicide
whose
golden
hair
strayed
over
the
white
satin
pillow
mingling
with
fragrant
rosebuds
and
lilies
after
the
funeral
was
over
he
drove
to
a
fashionable
street
and
stopping
at
a
fine
hotel
sent
up
his
card
to
a
person
whom
he
designated
as
colville
after
a
brief
delay
he
was
shown
up
to
that
gentleman
room
colville
was
a
rather
handsome
but
man
of
perhaps
forty
years
he
was
dressed
in
the
extreme
of
fashion
and
the
elegance
of
his
apparel
his
costly
diamonds
as
well
as
the
luxuriousness
of
the
furniture
about
him
betokened
a
man
of
wealth
and
ease
he
removed
his
cigar
from
his
dark
mustached
lips
and
said
with
a
light
laugh
ah
pratt
what
deviltry
are
you
up
to
now
i
have
just
come
from
attending
a
funeral
doctor
pratt
answered
sedately
as
he
seated
himself
in
a
a
funeral
colville
started
and
grew
pale
was
it
that
of
of
miss
lawrence
the
same
was
the
calm
reply
ah
beautiful
lily
so
you
are
gone
to
be
the
bride
of
death
to
be
clasped
to
her
icy
heart
well
better
so
said
colville
bitterly
i
wonder
at
your
coldness
said
doctor
pratt
eying
him
keenly
i
thought
you
loved
her
to
desperation
man
man
i
did
i
did
cried
out
colville
starting
up
and
pacing
the
floor
wildly
but
what
of
that
she
would
not
have
my
love
she
laughed
it
to
scorn
and
was
about
to
give
herself
to
my
haughty
rival
great
heaven
i
was
nearly
crazed
by
the
knowledge
it
was
a
happy
madness
that
armed
her
hand
against
her
own
life
i
am
glad
she
is
dead
i
would
rather
she
were
the
prey
of
the
worm
than
given
to
the
arms
of
another
sit
down
sit
down
said
the
physician
shortly
calm
yourself
or
you
will
fall
in
a
fit
as
did
your
rival
on
hearing
the
dreadful
news
of
her
death
fell
in
a
fit
did
he
said
colville
stopping
short
in
his
hurried
walk
i
wish
he
had
died
but
no
he
might
have
rejoined
her
then
in
some
better
land
than
this
if
there
be
a
better
land
which
i
doubt
said
pratt
with
a
cold
sneer
colville
threw
himself
down
into
an
and
looked
moodily
across
at
the
physician
well
what
have
you
come
after
he
asked
abruptly
and
testily
you
have
put
me
up
to
so
many
devilish
schemes
that
i
always
expect
some
villany
when
i
see
your
satanic
countenance
i
have
put
my
freedom
in
jeopardy
this
week
for
the
sake
of
your
happiness
doctor
pratt
answered
with
assumed
indifference
but
if
you
take
such
a
high
tone
i
can
leave
with
my
secret
untold
a
secret
said
colville
looking
up
with
some
interest
your
secrets
are
always
worth
hearing
doctor
let
me
have
it
i
beg
you
this
one
is
worth
hearing
any
way
said
doctor
pratt
grimly
and
rising
he
turned
the
in
the
lock
after
looking
out
suspiciously
into
the
wide
hall
returning
he
drew
his
chair
close
to
colville
and
continued
calmly
i
can
not
afford
to
give
you
this
secret
colville
i
will
sell
it
to
you
for
the
pretty
little
sum
of
ten
thousand
dollars
a
mere
bagatelle
that
to
a
man
of
your
wealth
ten
thousand
dollars
is
the
man
mad
muttered
colville
why
man
alive
there
is
not
a
secret
under
the
sun
i
would
pay
that
much
for
is
there
not
smiled
the
other
and
bending
a
little
nearer
he
whispered
in
low
impressive
accents
what
would
you
give
me
harold
colville
if
i
could
take
lily
lawrence
from
her
coffin
cheat
the
of
its
prey
and
give
her
to
your
arms
warm
living
beautiful
dead
to
all
the
world
alive
only
to
you
great
heaven
the
half
of
my
fortune
were
not
too
great
a
price
for
such
a
miracle
breathed
colville
excitedly
but
pratt
you
are
raving
even
your
skill
great
though
i
own
it
to
be
could
not
accomplish
that
unless
you
are
leagued
with
the
devil
as
i
have
often
suspected
you
are
thanks
said
the
grim
physician
curtly
then
interrogated
calmly
so
ten
thousand
dollars
would
not
weigh
much
in
the
scale
against
lily
lawrence
living
not
a
feather
weight
i
would
give
it
to
you
freely
gladly
but
pratt
you
can
not
do
it
i
do
it
listen
to
me
colville
he
whispered
breathlessly
lily
lawrence
lies
in
her
coffin
to
all
the
world
dead
but
to
me
she
is
a
living
woman
and
as
such
may
be
resurrected
but
how
why
be
calm
i
will
explain
all
when
her
lifeless
form
was
discovered
i
was
hastily
called
in
i
went
i
carefully
examined
the
body
which
lay
to
all
appearance
cold
and
dead
i
found
an
almost
imperceptible
warmth
about
her
heart
a
tinge
of
color
in
the
palms
of
her
hands
and
a
vacant
stare
in
the
eyes
resembling
death
but
which
might
be
only
produced
by
that
rare
and
strange
disease
known
to
medical
men
as
there
was
a
slight
about
the
heart
but
the
blow
had
been
struck
by
such
a
trembling
hand
that
it
had
failed
to
penetrate
a
vital
part
and
the
dreadful
shock
of
the
attempted
murder
for
i
do
not
believe
in
the
sapient
jury
verdict
of
suicide
threw
the
poor
girl
into
a
state
of
syncope
or
catalepsy
so
closely
resembling
death
that
it
deceived
all
but
my
professional
eyes
yet
you
suffered
them
to
entomb
a
living
woman
for
your
sake
remember
colville
for
as
i
knelt
by
the
beautiful
creature
half
stunned
by
my
startling
discovery
the
thought
of
you
darted
into
my
head
like
an
inspiration
i
remembered
what
you
must
suffer
if
she
lived
to
bless
your
rival
with
her
love
i
said
to
myself
it
will
be
several
days
most
likely
before
she
rouses
from
this
trance
of
death
let
them
bury
her
and
make
to
themselves
other
idols
in
the
meantime
i
will
resurrect
her
give
her
to
eager
arms
and
earn
his
eternal
gratitude
as
well
as
a
more
substantial
fee
for
myself
pratt
you
are
a
demon
is
that
the
way
you
thank
me
for
my
friendship
no
oh
no
you
have
done
well
you
have
done
right
and
you
shall
have
your
reward
but
heavens
to
think
of
her
lying
there
in
her
living
beauty
among
the
skeletons
and
the
worms
perhaps
even
now
she
is
waking
amid
those
gloomy
shades
ugh
he
shuddered
and
started
from
the
chair
no
danger
i
think
said
the
dark
physician
smiling
contemptuously
i
observed
her
closely
this
evening
and
there
were
no
signs
of
reviving
patience
my
friend
i
bribed
the
old
sexton
i
have
the
key
to
the
vault
in
a
few
hours
it
will
be
night
and
then
we
will
bear
away
your
drooping
lily
to
revive
beneath
the
sunshine
of
your
love
but
where
can
we
take
her
if
the
theft
is
discovered
there
will
be
a
hue
and
cry
raised
about
the
body
i
know
of
a
safe
place
you
remember
the
old
couple
in
the
suburbs
the
same
who
kept
poor
fanny
till
her
ravings
ended
in
her
death
oh
god
do
not
remind
me
of
such
horrible
things
let
the
dead
past
lie
yes
i
remember
we
will
take
her
i
have
been
to
see
them
and
prepared
them
for
our
coming
you
will
have
to
pay
heavily
of
course
but
you
will
not
mind
that
in
such
a
cause
now
then
will
you
go
with
me
to
the
graveyard
i
will
and
may
the
devil
who
certainly
helps
you
in
your
evil
deeds
doctor
aid
us
both
in
this
precarious
scheme
and
restore
my
living
love
to
my
devoted
arms
amen
breathed
doctor
pratt
piously
chapter
iii
it
was
the
day
following
the
funeral
of
sweet
lily
lawrence
a
sunny
day
fragrant
and
bloomy
with
the
wealth
of
summer
outside
of
lawrence
stately
mansion
in
the
handsome
grounds
enclosing
it
flowers
blossomed
the
fountain
threw
up
its
diamond
spray
and
birds
twittered
and
chirped
but
within
the
house
all
was
silence
and
gloom
lawrence
was
shut
up
in
the
library
alone
with
his
grief
ada
lawrence
lay
ill
of
a
low
nervous
fever
induced
by
her
poignant
sorrow
and
vance
sat
in
the
alone
nervous
and
ill
and
starting
at
every
trivial
sound
the
widow
was
very
handsome
this
morning
she
wore
a
dress
of
thin
black
grenadine
relieved
by
creamy
old
lace
at
throat
and
wrists
and
delicate
ribbons
of
heliotrope
color
her
wavy
black
hair
was
braided
about
her
small
head
like
a
coronet
and
a
cluster
of
heliotrope
blossoms
nestled
in
its
silken
darkness
a
faint
roseate
bloom
tinted
her
lips
and
cheeks
and
hightened
by
contrast
the
restless
brightness
of
her
full
dark
eyes
and
the
whiteness
of
her
low
brow
she
was
fully
years
old
but
nature
and
art
had
combined
so
gracefully
in
her
that
she
did
not
appear
a
sudden
peal
of
the
made
her
spring
up
suddenly
in
nervous
terror
of
she
scarce
knew
what
she
had
hardly
reseated
herself
when
an
obsequious
servant
ushered
in
a
tall
exceedingly
young
man
it
was
lancelot
darling
the
betrothed
lover
of
the
dead
girl
he
was
a
splendidly
handsome
and
imposing
gentleman
but
his
elegant
dress
was
disordered
his
face
was
pale
almost
to
the
verge
of
ghastliness
his
large
brilliant
dark
eyes
were
so
wild
in
their
expression
of
grief
that
they
almost
seemed
to
glare
upon
the
lady
who
advanced
toward
him
with
extended
hands
mr
darling
she
murmured
in
a
low
tone
of
surprise
and
pleasure
you
are
better
you
are
able
to
be
out
he
pressed
her
hand
speechlessly
and
tottered
to
a
sofa
falling
heavily
upon
it
while
his
eyes
closed
for
a
minute
in
a
fright
at
the
look
of
exhaustion
on
his
white
face
vance
darted
from
the
room
soon
returning
with
a
glass
of
cordial
she
lifted
his
head
on
her
arm
and
pressed
the
goblet
to
his
lips
trembling
excessively
the
while
in
a
moment
he
revived
and
rising
on
his
elbow
looked
up
while
a
faint
flush
mounted
to
his
white
forehead
pardon
me
he
said
in
a
broken
voice
this
is
unmanly
i
know
but
i
have
been
very
ill
vance
and
i
am
weak
still
and
it
is
hard
oh
so
hard
to
come
here
like
this
he
sat
up
pushing
the
dark
locks
back
from
his
brow
while
a
shudder
ran
through
his
strong
frame
believe
me
i
sympathize
with
you
i
grieve
with
you
murmured
the
lady
in
silvery
tones
our
poor
lost
lily
and
her
face
was
hidden
in
her
handkerchief
while
a
sob
seemed
to
shake
her
graceful
form
they
say
she
died
by
her
own
hand
he
cried
excitedly
my
god
what
mystery
is
here
vance
what
hidden
cause
drove
the
girl
who
was
almost
my
wife
to
that
fearful
deed
did
you
suspect
no
cause
asked
she
looking
at
him
sadly
none
there
could
be
none
young
beautiful
loving
and
beloved
she
had
no
cause
for
sorrow
so
it
seemed
to
she
answered
in
low
soft
tones
looking
down
as
if
she
could
not
bear
the
anguish
written
on
his
features
but
strange
as
it
may
seem
lily
had
some
trouble
unknown
to
us
all
but
which
i
suspected
months
ago
she
had
strange
moods
of
deep
depression
and
abstraction
followed
by
a
feverish
unnatural
gaiety
my
suspicion
of
some
mysterious
trouble
weighing
on
her
heart
was
only
confirmed
by
her
sad
and
tragic
death
of
what
nature
did
you
suspect
her
mysterious
trouble
to
be
asked
the
young
man
looking
at
her
in
surprise
and
anxiety
i
had
nothing
but
conjecture
to
build
on
said
she
reluctantly
it
would
be
cruelty
to
harrow
your
soul
with
suspicions
that
may
be
baseless
but
i
insist
on
your
telling
me
said
he
with
unconscious
imperiousness
of
tone
and
look
i
fancied
mind
i
only
said
she
deprecatingly
that
lily
though
betrothed
to
you
had
conceived
an
unrequited
attachment
for
another
or
that
perhaps
she
was
the
victim
of
some
entanglement
which
threatened
to
mar
her
happiness
oh
impossible
he
answered
decisively
lily
had
no
silly
entanglements
she
told
me
so
and
she
loved
me
alone
loved
me
as
devotedly
as
i
loved
her
i
am
perfectly
certain
of
that
no
vance
you
are
mistaken
the
theory
of
the
jury
is
the
only
one
i
can
accept
the
fatal
deed
must
have
been
committed
under
a
temporary
aberration
of
mind
the
sudden
entrance
of
lawrence
checked
the
mournful
expression
that
rose
to
her
lips
as
the
two
men
shook
hands
in
silence
each
noted
the
ravages
grief
had
made
in
the
other
lawrence
portly
form
was
bowed
feebly
his
genial
face
was
seamed
with
lines
of
grief
and
care
while
premature
silver
threads
shone
amid
his
hair
the
ghastly
pallor
of
lancelot
darling
his
wild
eyes
his
trembling
hands
attested
how
maddening
and
was
his
despair
lance
my
poor
boy
you
have
been
ill
said
the
banker
in
a
gentle
tone
of
sympathy
yes
i
have
been
ill
said
lancelot
brokenly
then
almost
crushing
the
banker
hand
in
his
strong
unconscious
grasp
he
broke
out
wildly
lawrence
i
have
come
here
to
beg
a
favor
of
you
name
it
said
lawrence
kindly
i
want
the
key
of
your
vault
i
want
to
see
my
lily
face
once
more
he
answered
in
an
imploring
tone
would
it
be
well
would
it
be
wise
asked
the
other
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
pain
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
ask
said
lancelot
impetuously
i
only
know
that
my
soul
hungers
for
a
sight
of
my
darling
face
do
not
refuse
me
my
friend
let
me
see
her
once
more
before
death
has
obliterated
all
her
beauty
better
think
of
her
lance
as
when
you
last
saw
her
in
life
and
health
said
the
banker
uneasily
she
is
already
changed
you
are
too
weak
to
bear
the
agitation
that
would
ensue
if
i
granted
your
request
you
refuse
me
then
said
the
young
man
in
a
voice
of
passionate
grief
she
was
to
have
been
my
wife
ere
now
yet
you
will
not
suffer
me
to
press
one
last
long
kiss
on
the
cold
lips
of
my
darling
oh
do
not
refuse
him
cried
vance
gliding
forward
and
laying
a
persuasive
little
hand
on
the
banker
arm
think
of
his
bleeding
heart
and
blighted
hopes
remember
how
fondly
he
loved
her
go
with
him
to
the
vault
and
show
him
our
broken
lily
lying
asleep
in
the
deep
rest
she
coveted
lancelot
heavy
dark
eyes
flashed
a
look
of
gratitude
upon
the
beautiful
pleader
as
she
ceased
to
speak
the
banker
paused
irresolutely
if
i
thought
he
could
bear
it
he
murmured
i
bear
it
i
said
lancelot
firmly
only
grant
my
request
the
sexton
has
the
key
of
the
vault
said
lawrence
yielding
reluctantly
i
will
go
with
you
lance
let
it
be
at
once
then
my
carriage
is
at
the
gate
said
the
half
frenzied
young
lover
moving
off
after
a
slight
bow
to
vance
lawrence
followed
him
the
door
was
closed
and
the
handsome
widow
stood
alone
in
the
center
of
the
splendid
she
took
one
or
two
turns
up
and
down
the
room
her
black
dress
trailing
its
gloomy
folds
over
the
rich
carpet
let
him
go
she
said
at
last
pausing
and
clenching
her
delicate
hands
together
let
him
go
that
marble
mask
of
his
beautiful
love
can
but
disenchant
him
i
have
already
dropped
a
suspicion
of
her
love
into
his
heart
he
does
not
heed
it
yet
but
no
matter
it
shall
take
root
it
shall
grow
it
shall
bear
fruit
an
hundredfold
he
shall
turn
to
me
yet
i
love
him
with
a
love
passing
everything
and
i
will
stop
at
nothing
till
i
call
him
mine
she
laughed
aloud
as
the
thought
of
her
future
triumph
swept
through
her
heart
it
was
a
strange
eerie
laugh
it
sounded
as
if
a
beautiful
fiend
had
laughed
in
hades
the
elegant
carriage
with
its
high
stepping
spirited
gray
horses
bowled
rapidly
along
the
busy
streets
of
new
york
and
at
length
paused
before
the
beautiful
cemetery
in
which
lawrence
vault
was
situated
the
banker
then
stepped
into
the
sexton
house
where
he
called
for
the
key
of
the
vault
the
sexton
gave
it
to
him
with
some
surprise
at
the
request
and
the
gentleman
returned
to
lancelot
darling
who
was
impatiently
pacing
a
graveled
path
in
the
fair
necropolis
of
the
dead
the
banker
paused
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
young
man
arm
i
have
the
key
lance
he
said
but
even
now
i
wish
i
could
persuade
you
not
to
enter
the
vault
i
dread
the
effect
on
your
already
weak
nerves
remember
what
a
difference
there
must
be
between
the
blooming
lily
you
last
looked
upon
and
the
poor
faded
flower
in
yon
gloomy
stone
vault
lawrence
you
do
but
torture
me
said
the
young
man
with
a
gesture
of
wild
despair
however
she
may
be
changed
let
me
see
her
yet
i
can
not
believe
that
that
beautiful
face
can
be
altered
so
soon
cruel
death
would
stay
his
defacing
hand
when
he
looked
on
such
loveliness
with
a
sigh
of
regret
the
elder
man
turned
and
walked
on
down
the
shady
path
lancelot
followed
him
taking
no
note
of
the
beautiful
day
and
the
song
of
the
birds
and
the
fragrance
of
the
rare
flowers
all
around
him
over
the
low
mounds
everywhere
gentle
hands
of
affection
had
planted
lovely
flowers
and
shrubs
trying
to
make
grim
death
beautiful
but
he
heeded
them
not
as
he
stopped
in
front
of
the
marble
vault
guarded
by
a
marble
angel
and
followed
lawrence
into
its
dim
recesses
they
walked
down
the
echoing
aisle
between
rows
of
moldy
decaying
coffins
and
paused
with
beating
hearts
and
labored
breath
beside
a
new
casket
loaded
with
wreaths
and
crosses
of
fragrant
white
flowers
the
murky
air
of
the
charnel
house
was
heavy
with
the
scent
of
violets
and
pale
white
roses
with
trembling
hands
they
removed
these
tokens
of
affection
until
the
lid
of
the
coffin
was
disclosed
with
a
shudder
lancelot
read
the
inscription
on
the
silver
plate
lily
lawrence
lawrence
drew
out
the
silver
screws
and
removed
the
lid
my
god
he
cried
as
he
gazed
within
the
costly
casket
was
empty
the
white
satin
cushioning
that
love
had
devised
to
make
the
bed
of
death
a
soft
one
held
the
impress
of
her
form
the
pillow
was
lightly
dented
where
her
golden
head
had
lain
but
the
cold
form
that
rested
there
yesterday
with
white
hands
folded
over
the
quiet
heart
with
pale
lips
shut
over
the
woful
secret
of
her
death
that
loved
form
was
gone
from
their
gaze
chapter
iv
go
with
me
kind
reader
to
the
outskirts
of
the
great
city
enter
with
me
an
humble
house
we
pass
invisibly
inside
the
locked
door
we
glide
unseen
up
the
staircase
and
into
a
plainly
furnished
room
our
acquaintance
doctor
pratt
is
there
also
his
harold
colville
is
there
both
are
bending
anxiously
over
a
low
white
bed
where
a
girlish
recumbent
form
lies
extended
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
stands
an
old
crone
with
gray
floating
under
a
tawdry
black
lace
cap
wrinkled
and
bent
and
with
beady
black
eyes
and
skin
she
is
frightful
to
look
at
as
she
peers
curiously
into
the
beautiful
white
face
lying
on
the
pillow
pratt
you
have
deceived
me
colville
breaks
out
sternly
all
your
restoratives
have
failed
all
your
potent
art
is
at
fault
look
at
that
marble
face
those
breathless
lips
it
is
death
not
life
we
look
upon
bah
said
doctor
pratt
rising
and
going
to
the
young
lady
head
he
gently
turned
it
on
one
side
at
the
same
time
he
changed
the
position
of
one
arm
retained
for
a
short
time
their
new
then
slowly
resumed
their
former
place
he
raised
her
eyelids
and
they
remained
open
a
brief
interval
then
gently
closed
again
the
beautiful
blue
eyes
they
disclosed
were
neither
glassy
nor
though
fixed
in
a
vacant
unnatural
stare
the
physician
resumed
his
seat
and
said
calmly
you
see
colville
it
is
life
not
death
i
tell
you
it
is
that
rare
mysterious
affection
we
call
a
state
fearfully
blending
the
conditions
of
life
and
death
a
seeming
life
in
death
or
death
in
life
it
is
true
that
all
my
remedies
have
failed
but
it
is
equally
true
that
life
is
not
extinct
though
the
spark
may
perish
from
exhaustion
if
she
does
not
soon
revive
it
is
now
four
days
since
the
cold
steel
entered
her
side
and
this
mysterious
unconsciousness
fell
upon
her
but
the
horrid
spell
must
soon
be
broken
or
death
will
ensue
as
a
consequence
of
loss
of
blood
and
vitality
they
withdrew
a
little
further
from
the
bed
pratt
still
keeping
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
patient
while
colville
tried
to
keep
his
roving
glance
away
from
the
face
that
sent
a
shudder
of
fear
now
and
then
along
his
frame
it
seemed
fearfully
like
death
despite
the
learned
theory
of
the
case
which
doctor
pratt
was
patiently
explaining
to
him
you
said
the
first
time
we
talked
of
this
that
you
believed
miss
lawrence
had
been
murdered
said
colville
suddenly
why
did
you
form
that
opinion
despite
the
contrary
evidence
there
was
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
said
the
dark
physician
complacently
i
formed
it
on
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyes
true
miss
lawrence
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
but
he
paused
a
moment
to
give
effect
to
his
words
but
a
heavy
luxuriant
honeysuckle
vine
was
trained
from
the
ground
up
to
her
window
in
the
second
story
the
murderer
or
murderess
entered
her
room
by
the
door
turned
the
key
perpetrated
the
dreadful
deed
and
escaped
by
sliding
down
the
vine
to
the
ground
that
is
only
your
theory
doctor
i
suppose
it
is
a
fact
not
theory
monsieur
i
furtively
examined
the
vine
myself
it
was
broken
in
places
bruised
in
its
tender
parts
and
quantities
of
leaves
and
flowers
were
strewn
upon
the
ground
it
plainly
showed
that
a
heavy
body
had
slid
down
upon
it
and
injured
it
i
wonder
that
it
escaped
the
dull
eyes
of
the
jury
you
are
an
astute
man
doctor
who
then
was
the
assassin
of
one
so
young
and
fair
i
do
not
know
but
i
half
suspected
the
beautiful
woman
who
lives
at
lawrence
a
sort
of
cousin
i
think
a
vance
by
name
her
evidence
went
a
little
further
than
the
rest
she
asserted
that
she
heard
the
young
lady
lock
her
door
that
night
she
seemed
to
favor
the
idea
of
suicide
also
by
pressing
a
theory
of
her
own
that
miss
lawrence
had
a
secret
trouble
was
subject
to
fits
of
abstraction
and
depression
yes
decidedly
i
suspect
the
beautiful
widow
what
motive
could
she
have
had
that
i
do
not
know
i
could
find
out
though
if
i
set
my
wits
to
work
but
i
have
no
interest
in
knowing
i
have
it
said
colville
suddenly
i
am
acquainted
with
vance
when
i
used
to
visit
the
lawrences
i
found
out
no
matter
how
that
vance
was
in
love
with
lancelot
darling
if
she
did
the
deed
it
was
jealousy
that
goaded
her
to
its
commission
very
probably
said
the
doctor
they
had
talked
on
forgetful
or
regardless
of
the
old
woman
who
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
was
listening
eagerly
with
twitching
fingers
and
muttered
inaudibly
gold
gold
what
are
you
muttering
about
old
hag
said
pratt
overhearing
her
none
of
your
jargon
now
and
do
repeat
what
we
have
been
saying
to
your
old
man
if
you
do
i
will
send
your
black
soul
to
its
doom
sooner
than
it
would
go
of
its
own
accord
do
you
hear
me
old
witch
yes
i
hear
i
will
never
repeat
it
never
whined
the
old
wretch
grinning
horribly
see
that
you
do
then
said
colville
the
evening
hours
wore
on
to
midnight
and
the
three
watchers
in
the
quiet
room
kept
their
places
undisturbed
by
even
a
breath
from
the
pale
form
on
the
bed
the
old
crone
sat
wide
awake
and
on
the
alert
doctor
pratt
leaned
back
and
watched
the
patient
through
lids
colville
dozed
in
a
large
surely
there
never
was
a
patient
who
gave
so
little
trouble
to
the
nurses
no
querulous
complaint
came
from
the
pale
lips
no
restless
hands
tossed
aside
the
no
tongue
cried
out
for
the
cooling
draught
of
still
and
pale
she
lay
through
the
panting
summer
night
taking
no
note
of
time
or
aught
earthly
hark
the
midnight
hour
tolled
solemnly
and
sharply
mysterious
hour
when
crime
stalks
abroad
under
shelter
of
darkness
when
disembodied
spirits
the
haunts
of
men
colville
started
from
his
uneasy
dozing
then
settled
himself
again
as
the
last
loud
stroke
died
away
in
hollow
echoes
but
he
did
not
sleep
again
for
a
simultaneous
cry
from
the
physician
and
the
old
woman
turned
his
glance
toward
the
bed
ah
what
was
that
the
awful
spell
of
death
was
the
patient
presented
a
ghastly
appearance
her
large
blue
eyes
were
wide
open
and
staring
an
indescribable
look
of
horror
at
the
face
of
the
old
woman
her
lips
were
slightly
apart
and
a
thin
stream
of
blood
was
trickling
from
her
mouth
and
nostrils
begone
said
the
physician
sharply
bring
warm
water
and
sponges
she
quickly
returned
with
the
necessary
articles
doctor
pratt
gently
sponged
away
the
blood
with
warm
water
so
as
not
to
entirely
check
the
bleeding
a
long
deep
sigh
quivered
over
the
patient
lips
and
turning
her
head
she
looked
languidly
about
her
doctor
pratt
made
a
sign
to
colville
and
he
hastily
drew
aside
out
of
range
of
her
vision
drink
this
wine
lily
said
the
physician
putting
a
to
her
lips
she
feebly
swallowed
the
contents
then
closing
her
eyes
with
a
languid
sigh
fell
into
a
deep
refreshing
sleep
breathing
softly
and
audibly
he
turned
to
colville
with
a
triumphant
smile
what
about
my
theory
said
he
colville
was
trembling
with
excitement
he
came
forward
and
looked
at
the
face
sleeping
calmly
on
the
pillow
its
rigid
lines
softening
into
natural
repose
surely
pratt
you
are
in
league
with
the
devil
said
he
an
hour
ago
i
could
have
sworn
that
it
was
grim
death
we
looked
upon
but
now
but
now
said
doctor
pratt
she
is
doing
well
she
will
soon
recover
and
then
you
can
set
about
your
wooing
ah
said
colville
doubtfully
i
wish
that
your
potent
art
could
insure
me
her
love
as
skillfully
as
you
insured
me
her
life
the
patient
deep
slumber
lasted
till
the
rosy
dawn
of
the
summer
morn
began
to
break
over
the
earth
then
the
blue
eyes
opened
with
a
look
of
bewilderment
in
their
beautiful
depths
where
am
i
she
languidly
interrogated
sweeping
her
small
white
hand
across
her
brow
colville
had
gone
but
the
unwearied
physician
sitting
by
the
bedside
answered
calmly
you
are
in
good
hands
miss
lawrence
i
am
your
physician
you
have
been
very
ill
and
must
not
agitate
yourself
by
asking
questions
yet
chapter
you
say
i
have
been
very
ill
said
lily
looking
up
into
the
dark
face
bending
over
her
yes
you
have
been
near
to
death
door
but
indeed
you
must
not
talk
you
will
exhaust
yourself
but
i
must
talk
said
the
patient
willfully
why
am
i
here
this
is
not
my
home
glancing
round
the
poor
room
where
are
my
father
my
sister
my
maid
oh
god
and
a
piercing
shriek
burst
from
her
lips
i
remember
everything
the
murderous
the
horrid
spell
that
bound
me
hand
and
foot
and
tongue
i
could
not
speak
i
could
not
move
but
i
heard
them
weeping
round
me
i
heard
for
heaven
sake
cease
you
will
kill
yourself
indeed
miss
lawrence
cried
the
physician
in
alarm
but
she
waved
him
off
and
sitting
upright
in
bed
continued
wildly
i
heard
your
voice
telling
them
that
i
was
dead
i
heard
the
horrid
inquest
held
over
me
i
heard
the
funeral
service
while
i
lay
in
the
open
coffin
unable
to
stir
unable
to
comfort
my
weeping
loved
ones
they
bore
me
away
they
locked
me
me
a
living
agonized
human
creature
into
the
dreadful
vault
with
the
horrible
dead
for
companions
ah
then
indeed
i
became
unconscious
i
knew
no
more
oh
oh
what
torture
what
agonies
i
have
endured
cried
the
girl
waving
her
white
hands
over
her
head
and
screaming
aloud
in
her
terrified
recollection
of
the
dreadful
agonies
she
had
borne
while
in
her
cataleptic
state
she
will
kill
herself
indeed
muttered
pratt
hastily
forcing
a
composing
draught
between
her
writhing
lips
she
continued
to
rave
wildly
until
the
potent
drug
took
effect
on
her
overwrought
system
and
produced
a
deep
unnatural
slumber
he
went
away
and
left
her
to
the
care
of
the
witchlike
old
woman
she
awoke
toward
evening
and
found
the
old
woman
knitting
away
by
her
bedside
the
beautiful
girl
looked
at
her
in
wonder
and
fright
are
you
a
vision
from
another
world
or
only
a
fevered
phantom
of
my
brain
she
inquired
in
a
weak
voice
the
creature
only
scowled
at
her
in
reply
but
she
rose
and
brought
a
bowl
of
fresh
arrowroot
and
fed
the
patient
who
found
it
very
refreshing
after
her
protracted
fasting
old
haidee
as
she
was
called
left
the
room
with
the
empty
bowl
and
lily
lay
still
looking
about
her
with
a
vague
dread
creeping
into
her
heart
had
she
indeed
died
in
that
horrible
vault
and
was
she
now
in
another
world
inhabited
by
such
hideous
beings
as
the
one
who
had
just
left
her
she
shuddered
and
closed
her
eyes
the
sound
of
a
footstep
aroused
her
a
man
was
entering
the
room
it
was
harold
colville
he
came
and
stood
by
the
looking
down
at
her
pale
face
with
passionate
tenderness
shining
in
his
eyes
her
white
cheeks
turned
crimson
mr
colville
she
cried
angrily
what
means
this
unwarrantable
intrusion
oh
lily
this
from
you
he
cried
in
sorrowful
reproach
lily
i
have
saved
your
life
my
darling
and
this
is
my
reward
when
all
others
deserted
you
and
left
you
in
your
coffin
my
love
could
not
rest
without
one
more
look
at
your
dear
face
yes
the
love
you
spurned
in
happier
days
clung
to
you
then
and
sought
you
amid
the
horrors
of
the
dreadful
i
entered
the
vault
i
opened
the
coffin
i
kissed
the
lips
that
were
dearer
to
me
dead
than
those
of
any
living
woman
and
then
i
discovered
faint
signs
of
life
in
my
rapture
at
the
discovery
i
bore
you
away
in
my
carriage
and
placed
you
under
the
care
of
a
splendid
physician
you
revived
you
lived
yes
dead
to
all
the
world
beside
you
live
alone
for
me
my
fair
my
peerless
lily
he
smiled
triumphantly
while
a
look
of
horror
dawned
in
her
eyes
you
you
will
restore
me
to
my
friends
she
gasped
in
breathless
agitation
lily
can
you
ask
it
can
i
bear
to
give
you
up
long
and
truly
as
i
have
loved
you
when
death
in
compassion
for
my
sorrow
has
given
you
up
from
the
very
tomb
itself
to
my
loving
arms
could
i
give
you
back
to
your
less
devoted
lover
and
live
my
life
without
you
my
peerless
darling
lily
do
not
ask
me
for
such
a
sacrifice
i
am
never
to
see
father
sister
friends
again
asked
she
with
whitening
lips
yes
yes
lily
only
consent
to
reward
my
fidelity
with
your
dear
hand
and
you
shall
see
them
all
again
i
can
not
she
moaned
faintly
i
am
betrothed
to
another
death
has
broken
the
bond
said
he
your
lover
has
torn
you
from
his
heart
ere
this
in
angry
resentment
at
your
supposed
suicide
he
believes
that
you
loved
another
and
chose
death
in
preference
to
a
loveless
marriage
with
him
give
yourself
to
me
lily
and
that
will
confirm
his
belief
oh
never
never
i
do
not
love
you
she
cried
vehemently
love
would
come
in
time
darling
gratitude
to
the
savior
of
your
life
would
create
love
i
could
make
you
happy
lily
i
have
wealth
position
influence
all
the
things
that
woman
values
most
i
can
never
love
anyone
but
lancelot
darling
she
said
while
a
blush
tinged
her
cheek
at
the
sweet
confession
his
brow
grew
dark
as
night
speak
not
the
name
of
my
hated
rival
he
cried
angrily
i
saved
your
life
not
he
yet
this
is
your
gratitude
oh
indeed
i
am
grateful
if
indeed
you
saved
my
life
she
cried
but
ask
me
for
some
other
reward
take
my
eternal
gratitude
my
undying
friendship
take
the
last
penny
of
my
fortune
but
spare
me
my
happiness
you
rave
lily
he
answered
coldly
nothing
you
have
offered
me
has
any
value
in
my
eyes
except
yourself
i
will
never
never
resign
you
you
are
in
my
power
here
to
all
the
world
you
are
dead
you
shall
remain
so
until
you
marry
me
i
will
never
never
marry
you
she
cried
with
passionate
defiance
we
shall
see
he
answered
angrily
but
his
words
fell
on
deaf
ears
she
had
fallen
back
in
a
deep
swoon
he
went
out
and
sent
haidee
to
assist
her
while
he
hurriedly
left
the
house
the
swoon
was
a
deep
one
lily
lay
quite
exhausted
after
she
revived
and
was
still
and
speechless
for
some
hours
doctor
pratt
came
that
night
and
gave
her
another
sleeping
potion
she
took
it
quietly
without
remark
and
slept
heavily
all
night
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
next
day
when
old
haidee
sitting
by
her
pillow
started
to
find
those
large
blue
eyes
fixed
thoughtfully
upon
her
she
ran
and
brought
a
nourishing
breakfast
to
her
patient
you
are
better
said
she
in
her
cracked
voice
seeing
that
lily
ate
with
an
appetite
i
am
stronger
said
she
as
haidee
removed
the
tray
she
was
quiet
a
while
after
the
old
crone
had
taken
her
seat
and
resumed
her
knitting
presently
she
asked
abruptly
what
is
your
name
they
call
me
haidee
said
the
old
woman
shortly
do
you
live
here
alone
haidee
my
old
man
lives
with
me
said
she
you
are
very
poor
i
suppose
said
lily
letting
her
eyes
rove
over
the
poorly
furnished
bedroom
miserably
poor
honey
said
old
haidee
while
an
avaricious
light
gleamed
in
her
small
black
eyes
is
this
place
in
new
york
asked
the
patient
thereabouts
answered
old
haidee
would
you
like
to
earn
some
money
heaps
of
shining
gold
asked
the
girl
timidly
the
old
woman
beady
eyes
sparkled
aye
that
i
would
said
she
if
you
will
carry
a
little
note
to
my
father
for
me
i
give
you
plenty
of
money
said
lily
tremblingly
where
is
your
money
asked
haidee
cautiously
i
have
no
money
with
me
said
lily
but
my
father
will
give
you
some
when
you
take
him
this
note
the
pay
must
be
in
advance
said
haidee
provokingly
i
ca
trust
your
promise
lily
looked
about
her
despairingly
there
was
nothing
valuable
about
her
except
a
diamond
ring
on
her
finger
her
eyes
fell
upon
that
i
will
give
you
my
diamond
ring
if
you
will
carry
the
note
to
my
father
aye
aye
but
your
captors
would
miss
it
from
your
finger
said
haidee
watching
the
sparkling
jewel
with
greedy
eyes
they
would
suspect
you
had
bribed
me
and
they
would
kill
old
haidee
that
is
true
murmured
the
patient
sadly
she
lay
a
little
while
lost
in
thought
then
her
face
grew
bright
i
will
tell
you
what
i
will
do
said
she
see
there
are
five
diamonds
in
my
ring
each
one
is
worth
a
hundred
dollars
i
will
loosen
one
of
the
stones
and
give
it
to
you
if
you
will
help
me
to
escape
from
here
they
will
not
miss
one
single
stone
from
the
ring
or
if
they
do
they
will
think
it
had
become
loosened
from
the
setting
and
lost
come
what
do
you
say
it
is
a
risky
undertaking
and
the
reward
is
small
muttered
the
old
creature
my
father
shall
give
much
more
if
you
help
me
haidee
will
you
do
it
asked
lily
imploringly
yes
i
will
said
the
old
woman
greedily
now
asked
lily
yes
now
before
the
doctor
or
colville
comes
back
my
old
man
can
take
care
of
you
until
i
return
lily
shuddered
at
the
mention
of
the
old
man
but
hastily
begged
for
writing
materials
there
were
none
to
be
had
except
the
stub
of
an
old
pencil
and
some
light
brown
the
old
crone
brought
her
these
with
a
muttered
apology
for
her
poverty
and
sitting
up
in
bed
lily
wrote
a
few
feeble
incoherent
lines
to
her
father
dear
papa
she
wrote
i
am
not
dead
though
you
put
me
in
a
coffin
and
locked
me
in
the
vault
with
all
the
dead
and
gone
lawrences
i
was
stolen
from
the
vault
and
a
doctor
brought
me
to
life
again
i
am
kept
a
prisoner
here
by
harold
colville
who
swears
he
will
not
release
me
until
i
marry
him
i
have
hired
the
old
woman
who
takes
care
of
me
to
take
you
this
letter
you
must
give
her
money
papa
dear
for
her
kindness
she
will
conduct
you
here
where
i
am
oh

and
release
me
from
this
horrible
prison
your
loving
daughter
lily
taking
the
old
woman
knitting
needle
she
carefully
pryed
out
one
of
the
diamonds
from
her
ring
and
putting
it
with
the
note
into
hand
bade
her
hasten
it
is
a
long
way
from
here
it
will
take
me
several
hours
to
go
was
the
answer
i
shall
count
the
minutes
till
you
return
said
lily
god
bless
you
haidee
for
your
goodness
to
me
at
this
trying
time
the
old
woman
chuckled
as
she
went
out
and
locked
the
door
after
her
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
paused
and
carefully
reread
the
superscription
of
the
letter
number
fifth
avenue
said
she
gloatingly
ah
the
outside
of
this
letter
is
all
i
want
to
see
she
hobbled
into
her
room
set
her
old
man
on
guard
to
watch
her
prisoner
and
blithely
wended
her
way
cityward
chapter
vi
vance
there
is
an
old
woman
says
she
has
brought
the
laces
you
wished
to
see
said
a
trim
little
serving
maid
at
vance
door
vance
looked
up
impatiently
from
her
book
i
have
not
ordered
any
laces
at
all
said
the
lady
sharply
send
the
lying
old
creature
away
agnes
the
trim
maid
hesitated
you
ought
to
look
at
them
vance
said
she
timidly
such
lovely
laces
i
never
saw
they
are
as
delicate
as
and
very
cheap
i
expect
they
are
smuggled
goods
well
well
let
her
come
up
then
but
i
do
not
need
any
of
her
wares
agnes
went
away
and
presently
reappeared
a
moment
at
the
door
and
ushered
in
old
haidee
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
the
maid
then
left
them
together
now
then
said
the
lady
sharply
what
did
you
mean
by
saying
i
had
ordered
your
laces
oh
pretty
lady
forgive
an
old
woman
lie
to
the
maids
for
the
sake
of
getting
in
i
have
bargains
lady
lovely
laces
smuggled
through
the
custom
house
without
any
duty
i
can
sell
them
to
you
much
cheaper
than
the
merchants
can
afford
to
do
let
me
see
them
then
said
the
lady
with
apparent
indifference
old
haidee
unpacked
her
wares
and
exhibited
a
small
but
fine
assortment
of
real
laces
her
prices
were
extremely
low
and
vance
though
she
pretended
indifference
was
charmed
with
their
elegance
and
the
small
sum
asked
by
the
vender
after
a
good
deal
of
haggling
she
selected
several
yards
and
paid
for
them
in
gold
pieces
taken
from
a
silken
netted
purse
through
whose
interstices
gleamed
many
more
pieces
of
the
same
kind
old
haidee
eyes
gleamed
greedily
at
the
sight
she
muttered
working
her
fingers
give
me
the
purse
pretty
lady
vance
withdrew
a
step
in
amazement
old
woman
you
are
crazy
go
leave
the
room
this
very
instant
give
me
the
gold
still
pleaded
the
miserly
old
hag
i
will
have
you
turned
out
of
the
house
this
minute
miserable
old
beggar
cried
vance
moving
toward
the
bell
stop
one
moment
lady
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
a
secret
to
tell
you
you
would
not
have
me
tell
it
before
the
servants
would
you
said
the
old
woman
in
such
a
meaning
tone
that
vance
actually
hesitated
with
her
hand
on
the
say
on
said
she
haughtily
and
thinking
to
herself
that
the
old
was
insane
bend
closer
lady
the
walls
have
ears
sometimes
this
is
a
terrible
secret
said
haidee
with
a
solemn
air
vance
moved
a
step
nearer
impressed
in
spite
of
herself
by
the
eerie
gestures
and
sepulchral
air
of
the
speaker
lady
a
few
nights
ago
a
fair
young
girl
was
murdered
within
these
stately
walls
ah
you
tremble
she
trembled
too
when
the
jealous
woman
stole
into
her
room
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
struck
her
down
as
she
stood
looking
at
her
sweet
reflection
in
her
bridal
dress
yes
struck
her
down
with
a
brutal
in
her
heart
the
wicked
murderess
stooped
to
see
if
her
guilty
work
was
done
then
escaped
down
the
ladder
of
vines
that
climbed
up
to
the
window
the
jury
said
that
the
poor
girl
committed
suicide
but
we
know
better
do
we
not
beautiful
lady
you
are
a
fiend
cried
vance
from
the
chair
where
she
had
sunk
down
still
clutching
the
heavy
purse
of
gold
coins
in
her
cold
hand
you
lie
no
one
murdered
her
she
died
by
her
own
hand
lady

with
a
low
and
laugh

me
the
gold
never

come
here
to
blackmail
me
you
wish
to
frighten

by

cried
vance
passionately
very
well

to
lawrence

will
go
to

will
tell
them

who

this
lying
tale
besides

no
one
lady
i
haidee
leveret

the
only
witness
of
your
crime
and
you
can
buy
my
silence
with
that
purse
of
gold
said
the
old
crone
sepulchrally
take
it
then
said
vance
flinging
it
down
at
her
feet
and
keep
the
secret
till
your
dying
day
you
need
not
return
to
blackmail
me
again
that
is
all
the
gold
i
have
i
am
a
poor
woman
i
can
get
no
more
to
give
you
the
old
woman
gathered
up
the
purse
of
coins
hid
it
in
her
bosom
and
trotted
out
mouthing
and
mumbling
to
herself
vance
fell
down
upon
the
floor
writhing
in
terror
my
sin
has
found
me
out
she
cried
wringing
her
white
hands
helplessly
oh
lancelot
lancelot
it
was
all
for
you
a
lucky
day
said
old
haidee
to
herself
as
she
trotted
down
the
street
a
fine
piece
of
work
and
well
paid
for
a
purse
of
gold
and
a
diamond
well
well
she
stopped
and
took
poor
lily
note
from
her
pocket
where
it
had
lain
concealed
and
tearing
it
into
minute
fragments
threw
it
into
the
street
a
gentleman
passing
by
observed
the
action
curiously
it
was
lawrence
ah
if
he
had
but
known
whose
hand
had
written
the
note
whose
coarse
brown
fragments
lay
under
his
feet
if
he
had
but
turned
and
followed
that
hideous
old
witch
what
months
of
sorrow
might
have
been
spared
him
but
he
did
not
know
and
he
went
on
to
his
home
bowed
and
while
old
haidee
trotted
quickly
past
crooning
a
low
tune
in
the
pride
of
her
gratified
avarice
and
cunning
as
she
went
into
the
door
of
her
home
doctor
pratt
came
in
suddenly
after
her
now
where
have
you
been
haidee
he
asked
suspiciously
only
to
market
doctor
said
she
trembling
sidling
past
him
with
the
basket
on
her
arm
he
found
his
patient
restless
and
excited
she
was
tossing
uneasily
from
side
to
side
of
the
bed
and
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
feverish
he
took
the
small
hand
and
found
the
pulse
bounding
rapidly
beneath
his
touch
this
will
not
do
said
he
you
must
not
excite
yourself
unduly
the
door
opened
admitting
haidee
with
a
bowl
of
fresh
arrowroot
lily
looked
wistfully
beyond
her
but
she
was
quite
alone
she
saw
in
haidee
cautious
negative
shake
of
the
head
that
her
mission
had
failed
she
fell
back
crushed
with
her
disappointment
come
take
your
nourishment
said
pratt
kindly
she
shook
her
head
a
choking
sensation
arose
in
her
throat
and
she
could
not
swallow
she
determined
to
make
one
appeal
to
this
man
doctor
she
said
clasping
her
hands
imploringly
i
appeal
to
your
honor
to
your
generosity
to
your
humanity
to
restore
me
to
my
home
and
father
doctor
pratt
shook
his
head
decisively
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
do
that
he
answered
you
are
in
the
power
of
colville
i
am
merely
employed
by
him
to
attend
you
in
your
illness
you
must
make
your
appeal
to
him
he
is
a
villain
a
designing
wretch
she
broke
out
indignantly
i
will
make
no
appeal
to
him
but
doctor
if
you
will
go
and
tell
my
father
where
to
find
me
i
will
give
you
five
thousand
dollars
the
day
i
am
liberated
from
this
he
laughed
and
drew
a
newspaper
from
his
pocket
putting
it
in
her
hands
he
directed
her
attention
to
a
marked
paragraph
she
read
it
with
streaming
eyes
it
ran
simply
much
sympathy
has
been
excited
for
the
lawrence
family
in
the
painful
discovery
that
the
body
of
miss
lily
lawrence
has
been
stolen
from
the
vault
of
her
father
the
wealth
of
the
great
banker
makes
it
seem
probable
that
the
foul
deed
was
committed
with
a
view
to
a
heavy
ransom
it
will
be
seen
in
our
reward
column
that
lawrence
offers
ten
thousand
dollars
for
the
return
of
the
corpse
so
your
father
offers
more
for
the
repose
of
your
dead
body
than
you
do
for
your
living
one
he
said
laughing
no
miss
lawrence
i
can
not
accept
your
munificent
bribe
my
duty
to
colville
forbids
and
i
must
be
going
i
leave
you
some
medicine
and
will
see
you
again
take
the
best
care
of
her
haidee
he
went
away
and
they
heard
the
hall
door
clang
behind
him
lily
turned
to
her
silent
attendant
haidee
you
did
not
go
she
murmured
in
a
reproachful
tone
oh
yes
i
did
miss
but
your
father
was
not
there
readily
answered
the
treacherous
old
woman
oh
then
you
left
the
note
for
him
and
also
your
address
said
lily
in
a
more
hopeful
tone
aye
that
i
did
miss
said
old
haidee
lying
glibly
i
gave
it
to
a
very
pretty
lady
it
was
my
sister
ada
then
said
lily
no
miss
your
sister
lies
ill
of
a
fever
i
gave
it
to
a
lady
called
vance
lied
haidee
watching
the
patient
face
keenly
a
startling
change
swept
over
the
girl
white
features
fear
terror
resentment
all
were
blended
in
that
look
oh
she
cried
then
indeed
i
have
no
hope
of
release
she
will
not
give
the
letter
to
my
father
she
is
my
murderess
she
tried
to
kill
me
she
will
come
here
and
make
her
fatal
work
sure
watch
for
her
haidee
do
not
allow
her
to
enter
here
she
will
kill
me
indeed
she
will
kill
me
oh
me
honey
i
am
so
sorry
that
i
gave
her
the
note
said
haidee
artfully
but
do
not
be
afraid
she
shall
not
come
here
to
finish
her
devil
work
no
not
she
my
poor
deary
alas
alas
poor
lily
doctor
pratt
opiates
could
not
bring
oblivion
of
her
troubles
that
night
she
raved
and
tossed
through
the
long
and
weary
night
while
haidee
thoroughly
alarmed
was
very
glad
to
see
the
physician
face
quite
early
the
next
morning
chapter
vii
come
home
and
dine
with
me
lance
said
lawrence
meeting
lancelot
darling
amid
the
bustle
and
stir
of
wall
street
poor
lance
had
been
strolling
carelessly
up
and
down
with
a
wretched
look
upon
his
handsome
face
time
went
very
slowly
with
him
now
he
turned
about
and
shaking
hands
with
his
friend
walked
on
by
his
side
is
there
any
news
he
asked
his
mind
reverting
instantly
to
the
painful
event
which
occupied
all
his
waking
thoughts
none
answered
the
banker
sadly
some
of
the
sharpest
detectives
in
the
city
are
trying
to
trace
it
but
as
yet
there
is
not
the
faintest
clew
he
sighed
and
lancelot
echoed
the
sigh
both
walked
silently
on
at
length
the
banker
signaled
a
car
and
entering
it
they
became
at
once
the
cynosure
of
all
the
eyes
within
it
their
recent
terrible
affliction
was
so
well
known
that
sympathy
shone
on
them
from
every
eye
but
little
was
said
to
them
even
by
the
friends
they
encountered
the
mute
trouble
of
their
faces
seemed
to
repel
the
mere
trivialities
of
conversation
and
no
one
wished
to
speak
of
the
mournful
tragedy
whose
impress
was
written
so
legibly
on
the
faces
of
both
the
sufferers
you
are
looking
very
ill
vance
said
in
a
gentle
tone
of
sympathy
when
the
banker
had
left
the
guest
in
the
while
he
went
up
to
see
ada
whose
illness
had
not
as
yet
taken
any
favorable
turn
i
am
quite
well
thank
you
he
answered
absently
and
with
an
unconscious
sigh
he
was
looking
about
him
sadly
seeing
in
fancy
the
graceful
girlish
form
that
had
so
often
flitted
through
this
grand
room
she
saw
the
turn
his
mind
had
taken
and
instantly
diverted
it
to
the
present
has
anything
been
heard
from
our
poor
lily
yet
she
asked
in
low
mournful
tones
nothing
nothing
oh
vance
this
suspense
is
very
hard
to
bear
said
he
impetuously
won
by
the
gentle
sympathy
in
her
face
and
voice
to
an
outburst
he
had
not
intended
it
is
almost
killing
me
poor
lance
said
she
in
a
broken
voice
your
features
show
the
traces
of
your
great
suffering
it
is
hard
for
us
all
to
bear
but
harder
still
for
you
her
delicate
hand
fluttered
down
upon
his
own
with
a
pressure
of
mute
sympathy
while
she
buried
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
sobbing
softly
i
should
not
have
brought
my
gloomy
face
here
to
sadden
you
still
more
forgive
me
for
my
reckless
outburst
said
he
pained
by
the
sight
of
her
womanly
grief
which
always
goes
to
a
man
heart
do
not
regret
it
she
answered
through
her
sobs
let
me
grieve
with
you
poor
boy
in
your
trouble
believe
me
sympathy
is
very
sweet
thank
you
he
answered
gently
ah
this
indeed
is
a
house
of
mourning
is
ada
any
better
mrs
vance
i
am
sorry
to
say
she
is
not
answered
the
lady
making
a
pretence
of
drying
her
eyes
which
however
had
not
been
wet
by
a
single
tear
she
has
a
low
intermittent
fever
which
does
not
as
yet
yield
at
all
to
the
physician
treatment
god
grant
we
are
not
to
lose
our
lovely
ada
too
ah
that
would
indeed
be
a
sad
consequence
of
poor
lily
rash
suicide
he
shuddered
through
all
his
strong
young
frame
at
that
concluding
word
oh
god
he
groaned
the
mystery
of
it
suicide
suicide
if
god
had
taken
her
from
us
i
could
learn
to
say
is
well
but
that
she
should
weary
of
us
all
that
she
should
rush
out
of
this
life
that
i
thought
to
make
so
fair
and
beautiful
to
her
in
our
united
future
i
can
not
understand
it
it
is
horrible
maddening
musingly
she
murmured
over
a
few
lines
from
tom
hood
mournful
poem
the
bridge
of
sighs
mad
from
life
history
swift
to
death
mystery
glad
to
be
hurled
anywhere
anywhere
out
of
the
world
the
words
seemed
to
madden
him
impatiently
he
strode
up
and
down
the
floor
she
never
loved
me
as
i
loved
her
he
broke
out
passionately
i
could
not
have
done
aught
to
grieve
her
so
if
earth
had
been
a
desert
it
must
still
have
been
paradise
to
me
while
she
walked
upon
it
oh
lily
lily
you
were
very
cruel
do
not
grieve
so
i
beseech
you
said
the
widow
gentle
voice
timidly
she
took
his
hand
and
led
him
to
a
seat
you
will
make
yourself
we
can
not
afford
to
lose
you
too
you
were
so
near
becoming
one
of
the
family
that
you
seem
almost
to
take
the
place
of
our
dear
one
who
has
left
us
you
think
me
almost
a
madman
said
he
remorsefully
i
startle
you
with
my
wild
words
i
should
not
have
come
here
yes
you
should
she
answered
kindly
you
should
come
oftener
than
you
do
and
let
me
sympathize
with
you
in
your
trouble
who
can
grieve
with
you
so
well
as
i
who
knew
and
loved
your
dear
one
promise
to
come
every
day
dear
lance
and
let
us
share
our
trouble
together
i
will
try
he
answered
moved
by
her
gentle
friendliness
and
thinking
as
he
looked
up
that
she
was
a
very
handsome
woman
not
with
the
beauty
of
his
lost
lily
angelic
blonde
fairness
typified
the
highest
beauty
to
him
but
handsome
with
a
certain
queenliness
that
was
very
winning
how
dark
and
soft
her
eyes
were
how
beautiful
the
sweep
of
the
long
dark
lashes
and
her
cheeks
how
rich
and
soft
was
the
color
that
glowed
upon
them
and
deepened
to
crimson
tints
upon
her
full
lips
and
when
that
dark
bright
face
glowed
with
tenderness
and
feeling
how
very
fascinating
it
became
when
she
took
on
herself
the
of
comforter
how
softly
she
could
pour
the
oil
of
healing
on
the
troubled
waves
of
feeling
she
had
lance
soothed
and
quieted
before
lawrence
came
down
with
a
pale
and
troubled
face
from
ada
sick
room
dinner
went
off
rather
soberly
and
solemnly
the
array
of
silver
and
was
dazzling
the
edibles
costly
and
dainty
but
lance
scarcely
made
a
pretence
of
eating
lawrence
merely
trifled
with
the
viands
and
vance
was
the
only
one
whose
appetite
was
equal
to
the
demands
of
the
occasion
conversation
lagged
though
the
beautiful
widow
tried
to
keep
it
up
with
all
the
consummate
art
of
which
she
was
mistress
but
the
gentlemen
did
not
second
her
efforts
and
she
was
relieved
when
the
formal
ceremony
was
over
and
they
went
out
to
smoke
their
cigars
i
will
go
in
and
see
ada
a
little
thought
she
the
nurse
says
the
fever
is
not
infectious
she
tripped
lightly
up
the
steps
and
into
the
room
where
poor
ada
lay
tossing
in
her
burning
fever
she
was
very
much
like
her
sister
in
appearance
but
the
luxurious
chamber
where
she
lay
was
in
great
contrast
with
that
in
which
poor
suffering
lily
was
now
immured
true
lily
had
all
the
comforts
her
sickness
needed
but
here
the
capricious
eyes
of
an
invalid
found
everything
to
charm
and
soothe
the
weary
eye
here
delicate
curtains
of
silk
and
lace
shut
out
the
too
dazzling
light
of
day
here
dainty
white
hangings
delighted
the
eye
with
their
coolness
and
purity
here
and
there
were
set
vases
of
flowers
filling
the
air
with
sweetness
and
rare
and
costly
paintings
looked
down
from
the
softly
tinted
walls
an
expression
of
annoyance
swept
over
the
girl
fair
ingenuous
face
as
vance
bent
airily
over
her
and
touched
her
feverish
brow
with
her
delicately
rouged
lips
you
should
not
kiss
me
said
she
pettishly
this
fever
may
be
infectious
the
doctor
said
it
was
not
infectious
my
dear
murmured
the
lady
sweetly
i
asked
him
myself
this
morning
oh
you
did
eh
i
suppose
wild
horses
could
not
have
dragged
you
in
here
to
see
me
if
it
had
been
said
ada
sarcastically
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
my
love
asked
vance
gracefully
ignoring
the
spoiled
girl
incivility
nothing
only
do
not
talk
to
me
talking
hurts
my
head
replied
the
invalid
turning
her
face
away
ah
then
if
i
only
disturb
you
i
will
take
my
leave
said
the
handsome
widow
tripping
out
of
the
room
you
were
rather
rude
my
dear
said
the
nurse
surprised
at
her
gentle
patient
sudden
petulance
i
do
care
said
ada
vehemently
i
hate
that
woman
i
can
not
tell
why
it
is
but
i
have
hated
her
ever
since
she
came
here
to
live
nearly
two
years
ago
she
knows
i
do
not
like
her
but
she
affects
unconsciousness
of
it
keep
the
door
locked
nurse
and
do
not
let
her
come
in
here
again
tell
her
i
am
too
ill
to
see
anyone
when
she
kissed
me
just
now
i
felt
as
if
a
great
slimy
snake
had
crawled
over
me
ugh
she
said
shuddering
at
the
recollection
chapter
viii
the
great
agitation
of
poor
imprisoned
lily
lawrence
culminated
in
a
severe
fit
of
illness
and
doctor
pratt
found
need
for
all
his
skill
before
convalescence
set
in
again
colville
prudently
kept
himself
in
the
background
now
so
she
was
not
troubled
by
the
sight
of
the
villain
face
for
several
weeks
haidee
proved
herself
a
careful
and
efficient
nurse
and
in
three
weeks
time
poor
lily
rose
from
her
pale
weak
and
weary
her
girlish
heart
filled
with
heaviness
and
despair
she
had
again
and
again
entreated
old
haidee
to
go
to
her
father
but
in
vain
the
old
woman
stubbornly
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
all
her
entreaties
the
old
crone
husband
lily
had
not
yet
seen
though
she
frequently
heard
his
gruff
and
brutal
tones
in
the
next
room
to
hers
which
appeared
to
be
his
she
was
sitting
up
one
day
in
the
great
puzzling
her
brain
over
some
plan
of
escape
she
looked
very
lovely
still
though
wasted
by
illness
and
sorrow
haidee
had
provided
her
with
a
neat
blue
wrapper
and
her
fairness
was
almost
dazzling
by
contrast
with
its
becoming
hue
her
rich
golden
hair
was
gathered
in
a
loose
coil
at
the
back
of
her
graceful
little
head
showing
the
whiteness
of
her
neck
and
the
rosy
tinting
of
her
small
ears
a
fancy
seized
her
to
look
out
of
the
window
which
was
always
covered
with
thick
curtains
it
was
warm
and
sultry
and
she
longed
for
a
breath
of
the
sweet
and
balmy
air
outside
her
room
rising
with
feeble
steps
she
went
to
the
window
and
pulled
aside
the
curtain
horrors
the
window
was
barred
with
great
heavy
iron
bars
some
vague
indefinite
plan
of
escape
through
that
window
had
been
forming
in
her
mind
she
almost
screamed
in
her
despair
as
she
saw
the
futility
of
her
plan
hateful
said
she
angrily
and
clenching
one
in
her
small
hand
she
shook
it
with
angry
violence
to
her
surprise
the
rotten
yielded
and
the
bar
fell
from
its
place
and
remained
in
her
hand
very
cautiously
she
looked
through
the
aperture
just
formed
she
saw
that
she
was
in
an
old
and
house
set
in
the
midst
of
a
large
garden
whose
overgrown
shrubs
and
bushes
had
grown
wild
and
tangled
and
the
paths
there
was
not
another
house
within
half
a
mile
of
this
one
she
was
far
out
on
the
suburbs
she
comprehended
at
once
a
noise
below
startled
her
from
her
reconnoissance
hastily
fitting
the
heavy
bar
back
to
its
place
she
dropped
the
curtains
and
tottered
back
to
her
seat
assuming
an
air
of
indifference
and
weariness
the
door
opened
and
harold
colville
entered
miss
lawrence
said
he
coolly
i
trust
you
find
yourself
improving
lily
vouchsafed
him
no
answer
save
a
look
of
scorn
and
contempt
come
come
fair
lady
said
he
seating
himself
near
her
have
you
no
kinder
greeting
for
your
devoted
admirer
leave
the
room
if
you
please
said
she
while
the
indignant
crimson
suffused
her
cheeks
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
sir
nothing
surely
it
were
wiser
lily
to
try
to
make
terms
with
me
than
to
bandy
angry
words
remember
you
are
in
my
power
i
love
you
and
i
want
your
love
in
return
but
proud
girl
beware
how
you
change
my
love
into
hate
colville
said
she
it
is
cruel
it
is
unmanly
thus
to
persecute
a
defenseless
girl
i
beseech
you
restore
me
to
my
home
and
my
father
think
of
my
poor
father
my
suffering
sister
there
are
other
women
who
will
love
you
women
who
have
not
given
away
their
hearts
as
i
have
done
there
is
but
one
woman
on
earth
to
me
lily
and
i
have
sworn
to
make
her
my
own
you
can
not
move
me
by
all
you
say
as
well
try
to
topple
a
mountain
from
its
base
as
to
move
me
from
my
firm
will
better
far
better
were
it
for
you
lily
lawrence
to
waive
all
this
useless
pleading
make
yourself
as
charming
as
you
well
know
how
to
do
and
become
my
wife
if
you
still
persist
in
refusing
there
may
be
worse
things
in
store
for
you
she
could
not
misunderstand
the
insulting
meaning
of
his
angry
speech
the
hot
blood
flushed
into
her
face
then
receded
and
left
her
pale
as
death
in
bitter
shame
at
his
rudeness
she
bowed
her
face
in
her
hands
you
understand
me
said
he
with
a
low
malignant
laugh
so
much
the
better
now
listen
to
reason
lily
i
love
you
and
you
are
in
my
power
you
are
dead
to
the
world
dead
to
the
father
who
reared
you
the
sister
who
loved
you
the
man
you
would
have
wedded
consent
to
marry
me
and
within
an
hour
after
i
call
you
my
wife
you
shall
see
your
friends
again
and
tell
them
the
romantic
story
of
my
love
and
how
it
saved
your
life
you
can
tell
them
that
such
devotion
won
you
to
reward
my
fidelity
with
your
hand
all
this
i
offer
you
in
good
faith
and
honor
and
give
you
time
for
decision
but
refuse
and
well
you
know
you
are
still
in
my
power
she
rose
and
stood
confronting
him
in
all
the
pride
and
dignity
of
outraged
and
insulted
purity
she
was
rarely
peerlessly
beautiful
with
that
scarlet
tide
staining
her
cheeks
that
lightning
flash
in
the
violet
eyes
villain
coward
dog
she
cried
in
the
white
heat
of
passionate
resentment
how
dare
you
threaten
me
thus
know
that
i
defy
you
i
spurn
you
i
will
never
be
your
wife
i
will
die
first
do
you
hear
me
i
will
die
by
my
own
hand
rather
than
be
so
disgraced
rave
on
my
beauty
he
answered
laughing
tauntingly
flap
your
pretty
wings
against
your
prison
bars
my
little
bird
you
will
only
ruffle
your
feathers
in
vain
by
jove
you
only
make
me
more
determined
i
never
saw
you
so
beautiful
so
utterly
fascinating
i
did
not
think
you
had
so
queenly
a
spirit
my
fair
one
you
would
make
your
fortune
on
the
tragic
stage
oh
go
go
she
gasped
lifting
her
hand
with
a
wild
gesture
toward
the
door
go
leave
me
unless
you
wish
to
see
me
dying
he
paused
irresolute
an
instant
then
her
flashing
eye
and
dauntless
air
cowed
his
craven
spirit
into
submission
with
a
slight
bow
he
turned
and
went
out
of
the
door
face
downward
on
the
bed
lily
wept
and
sobbed
unrestrainedly
she
was
determined
if
release
did
not
come
ere
long
to
die
by
her
own
hand
better
than
dishonor
thought
she
with
another
burst
of
anguished
tears
she
looked
about
her
for
some
instrument
to
secrete
in
case
she
should
be
driven
to
the
last
stronghold
of
honor
there
was
nothing
to
secure
old
haidee
had
made
sure
of
that
well
she
thought
if
there
is
nothing
else
i
can
strangle
myself
with
my
handkerchief
the
hours
wore
on
to
twilight
old
haidee
brought
her
supper
grumbled
because
she
did
not
eat
it
and
scowlingly
withdrew
lily
was
left
alone
with
her
sad
thoughts
for
companions
she
went
to
the
window
pulled
aside
the
curtain
and
looked
out
the
twilight
had
faded
a
few
pale
stars
glimmered
in
the
cloudy
sky
a
crescent
moon
gave
forth
a
weak
and
watery
light
a
wild
thought
darted
into
her
mind
oh
if
i
could
escape
through
these
broken
bars
ah
why
not
she
stood
still
and
listened
familiar
sounds
from
the
adjoining
room
informed
her
that
the
leverets
were
retiring
she
crouched
down
and
waited
perhaps
half
an
hour
then
a
dual
chorus
of
snores
announced
that
her
guardians
slept
breathlessly
she
stole
to
the
window
and
removed
the
iron
bar
it
left
an
aperture
large
enough
to
admit
her
slight
form
she
tried
the
other
bars
but
they
seemed
more
firmly
fixed
than
the
first
one
she
had
tried
they
resisted
her
strongest
efforts
if
i
only
had
a
strong
rope
she
thought
to
herself
i
could
secure
it
to
these
bars
and
slide
down
it
to
the
ground
she
leaned
her
head
through
the
aperture
and
looked
down
to
see
how
far
she
would
have
to
descend
the
distance
appeared
to
be
about
thirty
feet
if
i
only
had
a
rope
she
thought
again
i
could
certainly
gain
my
freedom
freedom
that
means
home
again
papa
ada
lancelot
she
sat
down
her
heart
beating
wildly
at
the
thought
they
believed
her
dead
she
pictured
their
wild
incredulous
joy
at
first
when
she
burst
in
among
them
their
own
living
darling
what
a
story
she
would
have
to
tell
and
how
swiftly
the
vengeance
of
papa
and
lancelot
would
descend
on
vance
and
harold
colville
her
breath
came
quick
and
fast
her
courage
mounted
high
within
her
i
must
escape
she
murmured
with
passionate
vehemence
surely
there
must
be
some
way
out
of
this
horrible
prison
she
thought
of
all
the
stories
she
had
heard
and
read
of
the
escape
of
prisoners
she
remembered
that
she
had
read
of
one
man
who
had
torn
his
into
strips
and
made
a
rope
of
them
by
which
he
descended
from
the
window
why
could
not
she
do
the
same
cautiously
so
as
not
to
awaken
the
sleepers
in
the
next
room
she
removed
the
there
were
not
many
for
the
sultry
summer
weather
precluded
the
possibility
of
their
use
but
there
were
two
strong
linen
sheets
these
would
do
i
think
she
murmured
to
herself
i
am
so
light
it
would
not
need
a
very
strong
rope
to
bear
my
weight
i
will
tear
these
sheets
into
four
long
strips
each
that
will
make
eight
strips
i
will
tie
them
together
in
knots
fasten
the
rope
thus
formed
to
a
bar
and
lower
myself
from
the
window
if
the
rope
is
not
long
enough
i
must
jump
the
remainder
of
the
distance
then
free
from
this
dreadful
prison
i
must
trust
in
providence
to
find
the
way
home
she
set
to
work
diligently
she
was
obliged
to
be
very
cautious
for
fear
the
sound
of
her
work
should
penetrate
the
ears
of
her
jailers
she
had
nothing
with
which
to
cut
the
cloth
and
it
was
strong
and
difficult
to
tear
but
by
dint
of
hard
labor
with
teeth
and
fingers
she
at
length
accomplished
it
and
set
to
work
tying
the
slips
of
linen
together
it
took
some
time
to
make
these
knots
secure
when
that
was
done
she
secured
the
end
of
her
impromptu
rope
to
the
lowest
bar
of
the
window
and
looked
out
to
see
how
far
the
end
escaped
the
ground
joy
joy
it
was
only
about
ten
feet
i
can
easily
jump
that
distance
she
thought
with
a
thrill
of
triumph
at
her
success
she
looked
about
for
some
wrapping
to
put
over
her
thin
blue
dress
a
long
dark
cloak
with
hood
attached
hung
conveniently
against
the
wall
they
must
have
put
that
around
me
when
i
was
brought
here
she
said
so
i
will
wear
it
to
go
away
in
and
taking
it
down
she
rolled
it
into
a
compact
bundle
and
threw
it
out
of
the
window
nothing
now
remained
but
to
follow
the
bundle
she
stood
still
a
moment
with
streaming
eyes
raised
to
heaven
while
with
clasped
hands
she
invoked
the
divine
mercy
and
protection
on
her
perilous
undertaking
then
shuddering
she
climbed
into
the
window
forced
her
body
through
the
narrow
opening
and
catching
to
the
rope
swung
herself
downward
hark
there
was
a
swish
in
the
shrubbery
in
the
garden
below
as
if
some
heavy
body
had
dashed
through
them
her
heart
leaped
into
her
throat
her
clasp
on
the
rope
grew
unconsciously
looser
and
she
slipped
much
lower
so
low
that
she
heard
distinctly
on
the
ground
beneath
a
deep
low
hurried
breathing
in
an
agony
of
dread
and
fear
she
clung
tightly
to
the
rope
and
waited
for
some
demonstration
from
below
some
unexpected
peril
had
intervened
between
her
and
freedom
hush
hark
suddenly
as
if
all
hades
had
broken
loose
there
rose
a
fearful
sound
on
the
soft
warm
air
of
the
summer
night
louder
and
deeper
still
it
grew
and
lily
hanging
there
by
the
clasp
of
her
frail
little
hands
midway
between
the
window
and
the
ground
knew
that
it
was
the
cruel
hungry
relentless
baying
of
a
a
scream
of
terror
burst
from
her
lips
as
she
heard
the
dangerous
creature
at
work
beneath
her
wreaking
its
vengeance
on
the
cloak
she
had
thrown
down
tearing
it
and
rending
it
with
fangs
and
paws
thus
she
thought
with
a
gasp
of
agony
the
terrible
beast
would
soon
be
rending
her
warm
living
body
its
vengeance
sated
on
the
cloak
the
began
to
make
hungry
leaps
into
the
air
towards
lily
body
at
the
same
time
uttering
murderous
yelps
that
froze
the
blood
in
the
poor
young
creature
veins
she
felt
herself
growing
weak
and
faint
and
knew
that
she
could
hold
on
but
a
few
minutes
longer
ere
she
must
faint
and
fall
into
the
devouring
jaws
of
the
animal
oh
god
she
thought
what
a
horrible
death
to
be
torn
limb
from
limb
by
that
hungry
brute
papa
and
lancelot
would
never
know
all
she
had
suffered
she
had
escaped
death
by
steel
death
by
living
entombment
to
be
rent
in
twain
by
this
awful
suddenly
with
a
cry
of
rage
a
head
was
thrust
out
of
a
window
above
the
leverets
had
been
awakened
by
the
noise
and
now
hastened
to
the
rescue
lily
heard
them
coming
and
tried
to
hold
on
yet
a
little
longer
but
her
strength
was
spent
her
bruised
hands
relaxed
their
hold
and
with
a
shriek
of
horror
she
was
hurled
downward
into
the
hungry
jaws
that
were
waiting
for
her
she
heard
the
wild
prolonged
howl
of
joy
given
by
the
dog
felt
its
hot
breath
on
her
face
then
unconsciousness
supervened
and
she
knew
no
more
at
that
moment
when
her
death
would
have
been
but
the
work
of
an
instant
a
powerful
hand
grasped
the
dog
collar
and
dragged
him
howling
and
yelping
away
to
his
kennel
while
old
haidee
raised
the
unconscious
girl
carefully
up
and
looked
at
her
limp
form
in
the
moonlight
is
she
dead
muttered
the
old
witch
has
the
hound
killed
her
here
peter
as
the
old
man
came
back
from
fastening
the
dog
into
his
kennel
carry
the
girl
i
believe
the
dog
has
killed
her
they
carried
her
back
and
laid
her
down
upon
the
bed
whose
coverings
she
had
stripped
and
rent
with
such
high
hope
an
hour
ago
white
and
cold
she
lay
there
as
if
indeed
life
had
been
driven
from
its
beautiful
citadel
forever
old
haidee
carefully
examined
her
face
and
limbs
there
was
no
sign
of
any
wound
from
the
animal
fangs
he
has
not
bitten
her
if
she
be
dead
it
is
sheer
fright
that
has
killed
her
said
she
peter
you
ugly
brute
stand
aside
if
she
were
to
revive
the
sight
of
you
would
be
enough
to
frighten
her
to
death
peter
removed
his
homely
countenance
to
one
side
while
old
haidee
pursued
her
task
of
bringing
the
unconscious
girl
out
of
her
swoon
cold
water
camphor
burnt
feathers
and
ammonia
were
successively
tried
by
the
old
crone
before
faint
breath
began
to
flutter
again
over
the
pale
lips
her
eyes
opened
and
she
looked
up
in
bewilderment
where
am
i
she
moaned
what
is
the
matter
oh
what
is
that
her
wandering
gaze
had
fastened
on
old
peter
leveret
and
she
regarded
him
with
looks
of
horror
and
no
wonder
for
old
peter
was
and
deformed
and
had
a
countenance
so
wicked
it
resembled
that
of
a
brute
more
than
a
human
being
a
shock
of
bristly
unkempt
red
hair
surmounted
his
visage
and
his
straggling
beard
was
of
the
same
fiery
hue
he
leered
maliciously
at
her
looks
of
terror
pshaw
that
is
only
my
old
man
miss
said
haidee
shortly
you
need
not
put
on
so
many
airs
at
sight
of
him
for
i
do
assure
you
that
if
he
had
not
pulled
old
nero
off
you
just
in
the
very
nick
of
time
the
hound
would
have
torn
you
to
pieces
long
before
this
i
thank
you
said
lily
timidly
forcing
herself
to
look
gently
at
the
repulsive
old
creature
oh
where
did
the
dreadful
dog
come
from
we
keeps
it
chained
up
all
day
in
the
garden
and
at
night
we
lets
him
loose
to
purwent
you
from
escaping
miss
answered
old
peter
doggedly
strange
that
i
never
heard
him
before
mused
lily
reflectively
he
never
had
occasion
to
make
himself
heard
before
said
haidee
grimly
lily
shuddered
and
remained
silent
pray
miss
said
old
peter
who
had
been
examining
the
window
curiously
how
did
you
get
the
iron
bar
out
of
this
here
window
you
do
look
strong
enough
to
have
wrenched
it
out
the
woodwork
was
rotten
she
answered
quietly
i
pulled
the
bar
out
at
the
first
effort
peter
said
old
haidee
go
into
the
third
room
from
this
and
see
if
the
bars
are
strong
in
that
window
old
peter
hobbled
out
on
his
errand
and
haidee
said
shortly
i
did
not
think
you
would
try
to
give
us
the
slip
miss
or
i
would
have
warned
you
long
ago
about
old
nero
there
is
no
use
trying
to
escape
from
here
you
are
as
secure
in
this
house
as
if
you
were
in
your
grave
grave
perils
await
you
the
moment
you
step
over
this
threshold
old
nero
was
but
a
foretaste
of
what
you
may
meet
with
so
i
advise
you
to
marry
colville
and
content
yourself
i
will
never
never
marry
him
haidee
said
the
young
girl
sadly
yet
dauntlessly
and
you
need
not
try
to
frighten
me
from
trying
to
escape
for
i
shall
use
every
endeavor
to
that
end
i
can
but
die
and
death
is
preferable
to
what
i
must
endure
in
this
house
she
lay
back
and
closed
her
eyes
wearily
peter
leveret
entered
and
reported
the
bars
as
strong
and
tight
in
the
third
room
you
may
sit
here
by
the
patient
then
while
i
go
and
prepare
that
room
for
her
reception
said
his
wife
you
will
not
put
her
in
room
said
peter
with
vague
surprise
and
doubt
yes
in
that
very
room
there
is
no
other
where
the
windows
are
barred
she
must
occupy
that
until
we
can
get
this
window
fixed
nothing
will
hurt
her
i
dare
say
she
is
not
afraid
of
ghosts
said
haidee
grimly
as
she
passed
out
she
was
absent
half
an
hour
or
more
lily
lay
still
with
closed
eyes
all
the
while
dreading
to
see
again
the
villanous
countenance
of
old
peter
for
hideous
as
haidee
had
appeared
to
her
startled
eyes
her
aspect
was
beauty
in
comparison
with
that
of
her
husband
it
was
with
feelings
of
relief
therefore
that
lily
welcomed
her
return
come
said
the
old
crone
shortly
i
will
conduct
you
to
a
more
secure
apartment
miss
she
led
lily
along
a
dark
passage
thrust
her
rudely
into
a
room
and
locked
the
door
upon
her
chapter
ix
thus
rudely
disposed
of
lily
stood
still
a
moment
in
the
center
of
the
floor
whither
the
old
woman
rude
push
had
landed
her
and
looked
about
her
with
a
swelling
heart
full
of
grief
and
indignation
she
found
herself
in
a
meagerly
furnished
room
very
similar
to
the
one
she
had
just
quitted
the
single
window
was
barred
with
iron
strongly
and
securely
fitted
in
the
low
white
bed
had
a
very
refreshing
look
to
her
worn
and
agitated
frame
and
throwing
herself
upon
it
dressed
as
she
was
lily
fell
into
a
deep
and
weary
slumber
broken
now
and
then
by
a
sob
that
welled
up
from
her
heart
it
was
probably
midnight
when
she
was
awakened
by
the
peal
of
thunder
overhead
and
the
patter
of
heavy
rain
upon
the
roof
a
violent
summer
storm
was
in
progress
and
lily
lay
still
awhile
and
listened
in
awe
to
the
raging
elements
warring
furiously
together
in
a
temporary
lull
of
the
storm
she
fancied
she
heard
groans
of
pain
arising
from
beneath
the
floor
and
sprang
up
in
bed
trembling
violently
she
listened
again
but
the
sound
was
not
repeated
and
the
girl
smiled
as
she
said
to
herself
it
was
only
my
nervous
fancy
giving
a
human
voice
to
the
winds
and
rain
there
can
be
no
one
in
this
old
house
save
my
cruel
jailers
and
myself
she
laid
her
head
down
again
upon
the
pillow
and
as
the
ominous
sounds
were
not
repeated
and
the
wild
decreased
in
violence
she
fell
asleep
and
did
not
wake
until
the
sun
was
high
in
the
summer
heavens
haidee
entering
with
her
breakfast
and
fresh
water
for
her
ablutions
scowled
at
her
suspiciously
did
you
sleep
well
interrogated
she
very
well
answered
lily
coldly
and
briefly
did
nothing
disturb
you
through
the
night
said
the
old
witch
watching
the
young
girl
keenly
from
beneath
her
shaggy
eyebrows
thunder
awakened
me
replied
lily
calmly
and
once
in
a
pause
of
the
storm
it
seemed
to
me
i
heard
a
human
voice
groaning
but
i
became
satisfied
afterward
that
it
was
only
the
wind
in
the
trees
most
likely
said
haidee
i
glad
you
were
not
frightened
but
they
do
say
this
room
is
haunted
a
woman
died
in
here
and
they
do
say
she
walks
about
and
wrings
her
hands
and
groans
i
know
nothing
about
it
myself
but
i
will
own
that
i
have
heard
strange
sounds
here
the
long
lonely
day
wore
on
while
she
sat
absorbed
in
her
painful
thoughts
colville
with
malice
prepense
had
denied
her
the
solace
of
books
work
or
music
thinking
that
the
unutterable
weariness
and
stagnation
of
her
life
would
drive
her
sooner
into
his
eager
arms
time
passed
on
leaden
footsteps
to
the
impatient
young
creature
whose
life
hitherto
had
held
every
pleasure
that
love
and
wealth
combined
could
lavish
on
its
beautiful
idol
noon
brought
haidee
and
her
dinner
wearied
by
the
length
of
the
sultry
day
and
her
own
vexing
thoughts
lily
scarcely
tasted
the
food
brought
her
take
it
away
she
said
indifferently
i
have
no
appetite
haidee
haidee
obeyed
in
silence
and
left
her
walking
up
and
down
the
floor
in
passionate
impatience
now
and
then
she
shuddered
with
fear
at
remembering
her
escape
of
the
previous
night
i
shall
have
to
die
she
thought
despairingly
there
is
no
hope
of
escape
from
this
house
but
oh
may
it
not
be
by
such
a
dreadful
method
as
that
her
meditations
were
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
horrible
sound
it
was
the
clank
of
a
heavy
chain
mingled
with
the
anguished
wail
of
an
unearthly
voice
it
broke
so
suddenly
on
the
stillness
that
lily
started
in
affright
the
very
hairs
on
her
head
seeming
to
stand
erect
in
her
horror
she
had
never
been
a
believer
in
the
supernatural
but
what
was
that
she
asked
herself
with
a
wildly
beating
heart
the
sounds
continued
muffled
by
distance
yet
distinctly
horrible
and
realistic
they
seemed
to
rise
from
the
floor
beneath
her
feet
she
covered
her
ears
with
her
hands
but
the
sounds
penetrated
to
her
whirling
brain
in
spite
of
her
efforts
not
to
hear
dreadful
sounds
of
woe
from
the
suffering
lips
of
some
human
or
inhuman
creature
all
the
while
the
heavy
chain
seemed
clanking
in
unison
with
the
voice
was
haidee
true
after
all
lily
asked
herself
in
doubt
and
bewilderment
no
she
would
not
believe
it
only
the
and
superstitious
believed
in
such
things
suddenly
the
solution
of
the
mystery
broke
on
her
mind
like
the
light
of
an
inspiration
she
understood
haidee
anxiety
that
she
should
believe
in
the
unearthly
nature
of
the
sound
she
was
likely
to
hear
it
is
nothing
supernatural
she
said
to
herself
firmly
i
am
not
the
only
prisoner
in
this
house
some
poor
being
more
wretchedly
treated
even
than
myself
perhaps
driven
to
madness
as
they
will
probably
drive
me
is
confined
in
some
loathsome
dungeon
below
me
and
haidee
does
not
wish
me
to
know
it
poor
soul
poor
soul
murmured
lily
in
divine
pity
and
compassion
for
the
unknown
prisoner
as
she
sat
musing
sadly
her
eyes
fell
absently
on
the
carpet
beneath
her
feet
it
had
evidently
been
laid
down
the
night
before
in
a
great
hurry
for
it
was
unevenly
spread
and
was
not
tacked
down
there
was
no
carpet
in
the
room
she
had
occupied
before
why
had
old
haidee
been
so
particular
about
placing
one
here
it
is
rather
strange
she
thought
to
herself
haidee
had
something
to
conceal
i
will
look
under
that
carpet
she
glanced
toward
the
fearing
that
argus
eyes
might
be
watching
her
no
one
was
there
she
rolled
up
a
piece
of
wrapping
paper
that
lay
carelessly
upon
the
floor
and
pushed
it
into
the
opening
now
i
will
see
what
that
carpet
hides
said
the
brave
girl
to
herself
she
advanced
to
the
corner
of
the
room
and
slowly
turned
back
the
corners
of
the
gay
flowered
carpet
as
far
as
the
middle
she
was
rewarded
by
more
than
she
expected
the
carpet
had
been
drawn
over
a
in
the
center
of
the
room
it
had
recently
been
used
too
thought
the
girl
for
it
was
free
from
dust
and
a
small
crevice
appeared
at
one
end
she
inserted
her
fingers
in
the
opening
thus
found
and
cautiously
pushed
against
it
the
door
slid
back
under
the
flooring
lightly
and
easily
and
disclosed
below
lily
room
a
long
and
narrow
winding
stairway
it
looked
gloomy
and
dark
as
if
the
footsteps
of
the
wicked
alone
trod
over
its
hidden
way
and
with
a
shudder
lily
pushed
the
door
back
into
its
place
carefully
replaced
the
carpet
removed
the
paper
from
the
and
sat
down
with
a
heart
and
trembling
limbs
that
stairway
evidently
leads
to
the
dungeon
of
that
poor
chained
prisoner
was
her
inward
comment
who
can
it
be
that
haidee
has
immured
there
perhaps
another
victim
of
pratt
and
harold
colville
oh
god
that
such
infamous
villany
should
go
unpunished
beneath
the
sky
of
heaven
she
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
through
the
grating
the
sun
was
shining
in
the
blue
heavens
the
tangled
old
garden
refreshed
by
the
storm
of
the
previous
night
was
a
wilderness
of
bloom
untrimmed
the
roses
spread
their
wild
loving
arms
over
the
ground
or
climbed
heavenward
by
whatever
frail
support
they
could
reach
vines
broken
down
from
their
frames
blossomed
luxuriantly
on
the
ground
and
ran
across
the
winding
path
a
high
stone
wall
ran
around
the
whole
place
shutting
out
all
the
bloom
and
sweetness
from
the
curious
gaze
of
any
who
might
chance
to
pass
poor
lily
inhaled
the
fragrant
air
that
rose
to
her
window
with
a
sigh
what
sunshine
and
sweetness
and
beauty
were
outside
of
her
horrible
prison
what
grief
what
desolation
perhaps
even
madness
within
the
fresh
pure
air
infused
new
courage
into
her
fainting
heart
the
memory
of
those
mournful
anguished
wails
became
less
dreadful
as
her
courage
rose
i
will
go
down
that
winding
stairway
was
the
resolve
taking
shape
in
her
mind
i
will
try
and
find
that
poor
soul
imprisoned
beneath
me
ah
can
i
dare
i
who
knows
what
awful
shape
of
idiocy
or
madness
may
affright
me
thence
no
matter
after
enduring
the
dread
companionship
of
the
dead
in
the
charnel
house
i
can
bear
that
chained
creature
also
the
day
wore
on
twilight
came
with
its
dusky
shadows
and
passed
old
haidee
entered
with
supper
and
a
freshly
trimmed
lamp
lily
could
scarcely
eat
she
was
so
excited
by
the
thought
of
her
projected
night
adventure
i
suppose
you
are
trying
to
starve
yourself
to
death
miss
said
she
grimly
i
shall
send
word
to
pratt
and
he
will
give
you
some
stuff
to
stimulate
your
appetite
lily
made
no
reply
i
suppose
you
not
try
to
escape
continued
haidee
maliciously
if
you
do
old
nero
will
be
on
the
watch
for
you
he
never
sleeps
at
night
i
will
make
my
next
attempt
at
daylight
then
replied
lily
coolly
you
not
find
another
loose
bar
retorted
the
old
woman
angrily
as
she
went
out
with
the
scarcely
touched
dishes
lily
waited
a
long
while
in
perfect
silence
for
the
sound
of
the
old
people
going
at
length
she
heard
their
harsh
footsteps
creaking
up
the
stairs
as
she
had
expected
old
haidee
course
was
straight
towards
her
room
she
sprang
into
bed
drew
the
covers
up
to
her
chin
and
feigned
slumber
the
key
grated
in
the
lock
and
the
old
woman
fiendish
visage
peered
in
ah
there
you
are
safe
in
your
nest
pretty
bird
croaked
she
well
happy
dreams
to
you
so
saying
she
turned
the
key
again
and
went
away
satisfied
that
her
charge
was
safe
for
that
night
chapter
lily
lay
perfectly
still
but
quite
sleepless
for
more
than
two
hours
during
that
time
she
heard
several
groans
from
below
accompanied
by
the
ominous
clank
of
the
chain
at
length
as
the
cries
grew
louder
and
more
frequent
she
determined
at
all
hazards
to
seek
the
poor
suffering
creature
she
rose
and
removed
the
carpet
slid
back
the
and
gazed
down
into
the
gloomy
pit
below
all
was
blackness
and
darkness
but
the
harsh
wailing
sounds
arose
more
distinctly
than
before
she
took
up
the
lamp
in
her
hand
and
with
an
irrepressible
shudder
began
to
descend
the
winding
stair
presently
she
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
in
a
narrow
at
the
further
end
was
a
door
trembling
so
that
she
could
scarcely
hold
the
lamp
lily
advanced
and
tried
the
handle
it
yielded
to
her
touch
and
swung
open
she
found
herself
in
an
empty
dismal
room
its
walls
festooned
with
cobwebs
its
cold
flooring
formed
of
solid
stone
as
she
looked
about
by
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
she
saw
another
door
and
resolutely
advancing
she
caught
the
knob
and
swung
it
open
another
instant
and
she
had
stepped
across
the
threshold
and
stood
in
the
presence
of
the
mystery
it
was
an
empty
cobwebbed
room
like
the
first
its
only
furniture
consisting
of
a
narrow
close
beside
it
an
iron
staple
was
driven
into
the
stone
floor
a
long
and
heavy
iron
chain
was
fastened
to
this
staple
at
its
opposite
end
it
was
linked
to
a
strong
leathern
belt
wound
about
the
frame
of
a
poor
creature
lying
at
full
length
on
the
bed
and
wasted
to
a
living
in
all
her
speculations
regarding
the
mysterious
prisoner
lily
had
not
imagined
aught
as
dreadful
as
the
reality
there
lay
the
poor
frame
upon
the
bed
its
tattered
dress
scarce
covering
its
bony
knees
its
hands
twisted
wildly
together
the
limbs
presented
the
appearance
of
bones
with
skin
drawn
tightly
over
them
masses
of
long
black
hair
tangled
and
unkempt
strayed
over
the
coarse
pillow
and
fierce
dark
eyes
sunken
and
dim
peered
from
their
hollow
orbits
in
a
face
shriveled
simply
to
skin
and
bone
the
cheeks
fallen
in
the
temples
hollow
the
purple
lips
drawn
away
from
the
glistening
white
teeth
this
dreadful
creature
stopped
its
frenzied
cries
at
entrance
and
crouching
into
a
frightened
heap
wailed
out
submissively
i
will
hush
i
will
hush
do
not
beat
me
again
poor
creature
i
will
not
harm
you
answered
lily
gently
she
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
holding
the
lamp
in
her
shaking
hand
its
light
streaming
over
her
lovely
face
and
golden
hair
the
poor
creature
turned
suddenly
at
the
sound
of
her
compassionate
voice
and
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
of
awe
in
her
great
hollow
eyes
are
you
an
angel
she
asked
abruptly
no
poor
soul
i
am
a
wronged
and
unhappy
prisoner
like
yourself
another
one
of
victims
queried
the
living
skeleton
sitting
up
on
the
cot
and
folding
her
emaciated
arms
around
her
skinny
knees
lily
came
forward
and
seated
herself
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
set
her
lamp
on
the
floor
of
whom
are
you
speaking
asked
she
of
harold
colville
to
be
sure
said
the
poor
woman
shuddering
as
the
name
writhed
over
her
blanched
lips
has
he
married
you
too
eh
god
forbid
ejaculated
her
visitor
with
a
strong
shiver
of
disgust
i
am
a
poor
girl
whom
he
is
trying
to
force
into
a
marriage
with
him
he
has
stolen
me
away
from
my
friends
and
is
keeping
me
locked
up
here
until
i
consent
to
be
his
wife
but
i
will
never
never
do
so
she
cried
passionately
you
do
not
love
him
said
the
poor
frame
beside
her
no
i
hate
him
but
who
are
you
asked
lily
her
interest
deepening
in
the
poor
creature
whose
mind
it
was
evident
still
burned
clearly
in
her
wrecked
frame
i
am
fanny
colville
was
the
answer
in
a
low
and
bitter
tone
i
am
harold
colville
lawful
wife
i
was
married
to
him
four
years
ago
is
it
possible
cried
lily
with
a
violent
start
then
why
are
you
here
my
husband
wearied
of
me
said
poor
fanny
her
dark
eyes
burning
like
coals
he
stole
me
away
from
my
friends
too
lady
but
i
went
willingly
because
i
loved
him
yes
i
loved
him
then
he
married
me
and
i
hid
away
the
certificate
the
good
minister
gave
me
we
traveled
for
a
year
or
so
and
lived
very
happily
then
he
wearied
of
me
and
brought
me
here
he
told
me
our
marriage
ceremony
was
a
farce
that
we
had
not
been
lawfully
married
he
demanded
the
certificate
the
minister
had
given
me
but
i
was
not
a
fool
i
knew
he
lied
to
me
and
i
would
not
give
up
the
paper
for
the
sake
of
the
little
child
that
was
soon
coming
to
me
i
kept
it
hidden
away
and
he
raved
and
swore
at
me
then
went
away
and
left
me
he
hired
the
leverets
to
kill
me
and
the
child
also
when
my
hour
should
arrive
the
day
came
my
child
was
born
a
healthy
living
boy
they
took
it
away
from
me
and
said
that
it
died
i
knew
they
had
killed
it
but
they
were
not
merciful
enough
to
kill
me
they
drove
me
mad
with
their
cruelty
i
became
a
raving
dangerous
maniac
for
awhile
and
they
chained
me
down
here
like
a
dog
here
i
have
remained
nearly
two
years
fed
on
a
scanty
supply
of
bread
and
water
you
see
what
they
give
for
a
week
subsistence
said
she
pointing
to
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
jug
of
water
both
upon
the
floor
lily
looked
and
shuddered
does
your
husband
ever
come
to
see
you
she
inquired
no
no
he
thinks
me
dead
he
paid
old
peter
leveret
to
murder
me
but
they
are
slowly
starving
me
to
death
instead
of
thrusting
a
knife
into
my
heart
and
i
am
so
strong
it
takes
me
a
long
while
to
die
she
paused
a
moment
catching
her
breath
painfully
then
continued
dreadful
deeds
have
been
committed
here
murder
red
right
hand
has
been
lifted
often
look
down
into
that
pit
lady
she
pointed
to
a
near
the
iron
staple
lily
pushed
it
aside
and
looked
down
but
saw
only
thick
darkness
while
a
noisome
smell
rushed
out
of
the
pit
she
closed
it
hurriedly
i
see
nothing
she
said
but
darkness
because
it
is
night
said
fanny
colville
you
should
come
when
it
is
daylight
lady
you
would
see
horrible
grinning
skeletons
then
i
look
at
them
sometimes
they
are
the
only
companions
i
have
poor
fanny
i
wish
you
could
escape
out
of
this
horrible
place
would
you
like
to
do
so
oh
so
much
said
the
living
skeleton
clasping
her
bony
hands
i
have
dear
friends
far
away
from
here
whom
i
love
so
much
they
know
nothing
of
my
whereabouts
how
gladly
they
would
welcome
me
back
my
case
is
the
same
said
lily
mournfully
i
have
tried
to
escape
but
was
near
losing
my
life
through
falling
into
the
clutches
of
the
they
keep
here
but
i
am
going
to
try
again
fanny
and
i
will
try
to
help
you
out
of
your
prison
also
i
will
come
and
see
you
again
said
she
taking
up
her
lamp
and
turning
to
go
do
not
go
yet
sweet
lady
cried
the
prisoner
imploringly
i
love
to
look
at
you
and
hear
you
speak
i
have
not
heard
a
kind
word
for
more
than
two
years
until
you
came
in
like
an
angel
i
must
go
now
replied
lily
gently
i
am
afraid
old
haidee
will
miss
me
and
trace
me
here
keep
up
a
brave
heart
i
will
come
again
night
if
nothing
happens
now
fanny
miss
said
the
unfortunate
creature
seizing
lily
hand
and
kissing
it
i
am
happier
for
your
coming
and
i
shall
expect
you
again
night
the
young
girl
took
up
her
lamp
and
went
away
leaving
the
poor
creature
alone
in
her
dreadful
solitude
once
more
but
hope
like
a
brightly
beaming
star
had
penetrated
that
gloomy
dungeon
and
beamed
into
fanny
colville
lacerated
heart
she
lay
awake
all
night
thinking
feverishly
of
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
visited
her
and
building
bright
on
the
slight
hint
of
escape
she
had
thrown
out
and
lily
too
tossed
on
a
feverish
bed
which
gentle
slumber
refused
to
visit
with
its
benign
influence
fear
horror
and
indignation
filled
her
heart
against
harold
colville
and
the
leverets
mixed
with
deep
sorrow
and
pity
for
the
injured
fanny
she
understood
now
the
depth
of
villany
of
which
her
suitor
was
capable
and
the
wickedness
of
haidee
and
peter
appeared
more
dreadful
than
before
no
wonder
haidee
found
her
tossing
on
a
bed
of
pain
the
next
morning
racked
by
a
nervous
headache
colville
called
to
see
her
but
went
away
when
he
heard
she
was
ill
and
sent
doctor
pratt
instead
who
prescribed
a
sedative
and
left
her
sleeping
heavily
and
profoundly
chapter
xi
late
in
the
evening
she
awoke
feeling
rested
and
refreshed
by
her
long
sleep
her
headache
was
quite
gone
and
haidee
found
her
sitting
in
the
when
she
came
in
with
supper
she
drank
a
cup
of
tea
ate
a
few
mouthfuls
of
food
and
declared
herself
much
better
old
haidee
however
brought
in
her
knitting
and
pertinaciously
sat
out
the
evening
with
her
with
the
intention
no
doubt
of
listening
for
sounds
from
below
and
marking
their
effect
on
her
captive
but
no
sound
no
groans
broke
the
stillness
fanny
colville
in
the
new
hope
that
had
dawned
upon
her
had
refrained
all
day
from
the
groans
and
cries
that
usually
gave
vent
to
her
despair
she
was
impatiently
waiting
for
the
return
of
her
visitor
of
the
night
before
haidee
had
not
visited
the
poor
chained
captive
since
the
night
she
had
incarcerated
lily
in
her
new
lodging
in
fact
there
was
no
entrance
to
the
dungeon
except
through
the
in
this
room
haidee
had
taken
her
a
week
rations
that
night
and
scowlingly
bade
her
to
abstain
from
her
noise
or
it
would
be
worse
for
her
she
now
concluded
that
the
captive
had
obeyed
her
mandate
or
that
death
had
at
last
removed
her
out
of
her
power
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
relief
at
the
last
thought
that
she
left
lily
room
telling
her
with
a
malicious
grin
that
old
nero
was
loose
in
the
garden
as
usual
it
was
almost
midnight
before
lily
ventured
to
seek
poor
fanny
colville
again
long
before
she
descended
the
stairs
she
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
rusty
chain
as
the
poor
woman
tossed
restlessly
on
her
bed
of
pain
her
wild
eyes
lighted
glaringly
at
the
young
girl
entrance
i
thought
you
were
not
coming
she
said
pathetically
i
dared
not
come
earlier
lily
answered
relating
the
cause
of
her
detention
old
haidee
is
a
fiend
said
fanny
briefly
and
comprehensively
i
have
been
revolving
in
my
mind
a
plan
of
escape
for
us
both
said
lily
proceeding
to
detail
it
to
her
eager
listener
but
fanny
sighed
and
looked
down
at
her
skeleton
limbs
and
the
heavy
chain
that
would
do
for
you
but
not
for
me
she
said
i
am
too
weak
it
is
a
long
way
from
here
to
the
city
we
have
no
money
we
have
to
walk
several
miles
to
your
father
house
you
see
i
know
the
distance
i
came
here
in
daylight
i
can
tell
the
way
to
go
but
my
wasted
limbs
would
not
carry
me
a
mile
i
should
only
fall
by
the
way
and
be
a
hindrance
to
you
lily
sighed
as
her
companion
thus
presented
the
difficulties
in
their
way
i
had
forgotten
your
exceeding
weakness
in
the
ardor
of
my
hopes
said
she
besides
continued
fanny
look
at
this
chain
we
have
nothing
with
which
to
cut
the
leather
or
file
the
iron
i
can
not
get
away
from
this
staple
can
i
then
do
nothing
to
help
you
my
poor
creature
cried
lily
in
great
distress
as
she
saw
how
futile
was
the
plan
she
had
proposed
of
course
there
is
answered
fanny
hopefully
the
plan
you
spoke
of
is
quite
feasible
for
you
put
it
into
operation
as
soon
as
possible
i
feel
almost
assured
of
your
success
then
as
soon
as
you
have
told
your
story
to
your
father
tell
him
mine
also
and
entreat
him
to
send
a
force
of
police
out
here
to
arrest
the
leverets
and
liberate
me
certainly
i
could
do
that
said
lily
brightening
that
would
be
the
better
plan
after
all
but
still
i
can
not
bear
to
leave
you
here
alone
poor
soul
in
your
wretchedness
who
can
tell
what
may
happen
ere
relief
can
reach
you
perhaps
this
slow
starvation
may
finish
its
dreadful
work
upon
you
never
fear
was
the
hopeful
reply
i
have
subsisted
like
this
for
two
long
years
yet
i
feel
the
flame
of
life
still
brightly
burning
in
my
wasted
frame
and
think
you
i
can
not
endure
a
few
more
confinement
when
you
have
given
me
such
hope
to
feed
upon
her
eyes
were
brightly
burning
in
her
wasted
face
and
her
parched
lips
tried
to
smile
she
took
her
visitor
little
white
hand
caressingly
between
her
own
bony
members
and
looked
at
it
in
fond
admiration
you
are
a
beautiful
girl
she
said
ah
would
you
believe
that
i
was
once
a
pretty
girl
and
that
i
am
young
still
but
little
older
than
you
perhaps
for
i
am
only
twenty
though
trouble
and
starvation
have
made
me
prematurely
old
lily
looked
the
astonishment
she
felt
for
indeed
that
poor
face
with
all
the
curves
and
lines
of
flesh
stricken
out
of
it
by
the
sharp
pangs
of
starvation
had
indeed
no
mark
to
discern
whether
she
were
young
or
old
true
the
matted
locks
of
black
hair
were
too
thick
for
those
of
age
but
they
were
thickly
streaked
with
silver
threads
harold
colville
wretched
victim
retained
now
no
trace
of
either
youth
or
beauty
lily
remained
with
her
several
hours
feeling
all
the
while
that
she
ran
a
great
risk
in
remaining
yet
still
unwilling
to
leave
the
unhappy
woman
who
showed
such
pitiful
pleasure
in
seeing
once
more
the
friendly
face
of
a
human
being
but
she
was
forced
to
go
at
length
having
listened
to
the
story
of
fanny
life
and
exchanged
a
like
friendly
confidence
i
may
not
see
you
again
fanny
she
said
for
i
may
make
the
attempt
it
must
be
made
in
the
you
know
when
nero
is
chained
up
but
you
may
rest
assured
that
if
i
succeed
in
escaping
i
shall
lose
no
time
in
having
you
liberated
and
your
guilty
captors
brought
to
punishment
may
god
help
you
said
the
prisoner
fervently
i
will
pray
for
your
success
and
with
a
sigh
she
kissed
the
white
hands
and
looked
lovingly
after
the
slight
form
as
it
glided
away
lily
went
back
to
her
room
half
apprehensive
that
the
old
witch
might
be
waiting
for
her
there
but
all
was
safe
the
room
was
vacant
of
all
but
her
own
sweet
presence
she
disrobed
herself
extinguished
the
lamp
and
lying
down
upon
the
bed
fell
into
a
light
slumber
broken
by
many
fitful
and
dreams
she
awakened
only
when
the
summer
sun
was
shining
high
in
the
heavens
haidee
was
waiting
with
her
breakfast
and
seemed
even
more
petulant
than
usual
it
seems
to
me
you
require
more
sleep
than
anyone
i
ever
saw
she
said
tartly
after
sleeping
all
day
yesterday
you
can
not
even
get
awake
for
your
breakfast
this
morning
i
dare
say
you
would
sleep
heavily
yourself
haidee
if
you
had
been
drugged
as
i
was
yesterday
retorted
the
young
girl
and
really
i
am
feeling
ill
and
weary
this
morning
this
warm
weather
and
close
confinement
begin
to
tell
on
my
health
sadly
perhaps
i
may
escape
you
yet
through
the
welcome
gates
of
death
no
danger
of
that
was
the
quick
reply
youth
and
health
can
bear
much
more
than
you
have
had
to
stand
yet
my
fine
lady
she
went
out
and
did
not
return
until
noon
her
prisoner
lay
dressed
upon
the
bed
with
flushed
and
burning
cheeks
and
strangely
glittering
eyes
haidee
she
said
i
can
not
eat
my
dinner
i
am
feeling
very
strangely
i
have
a
dreadful
feeling
here
she
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
heart
and
seemed
to
gasp
for
breath
go
send
for
the
doctor
as
quickly
as
possible
perhaps
i
am
about
to
die
haidee
looked
at
her
in
doubt
a
moment
the
suffering
aspect
of
the
captive
reassured
her
she
was
evidently
i
will
send
at
once
for
doctor
pratt
said
she
leaving
the
room
in
haste
but
not
forgetting
to
lock
the
door
i
have
sent
old
peter
for
the
doctor
said
she
returning
but
it
may
be
several
hours
before
he
returns
it
is
a
long
way
to
the
city
sit
down
and
stay
with
me
then
haidee
i
am
afraid
to
remain
alone
when
i
feel
so
strangely
ten
fifteen
minutes
elapsed
then
the
patient
said
faintly
haidee
for
the
love
of
heaven
try
and
get
me
a
glass
of
wine
perhaps
it
may
relieve
this
wild
fluttering
and
palpitation
of
my
heart
again
haidee
went
out
locking
the
door
as
before
the
patient
sprang
up
and
stood
waiting
when
the
witch
returned
the
key
grated
the
door
swung
open
but
at
that
instant
haidee
received
a
dexterous
push
that
sent
her
sprawling
into
the
middle
of
the
room
the
wine
glass
crashing
on
the
floor
before
she
could
rise
lily
sprang
past
her
into
the
hall
slammed
and
locked
the
door
removed
the
key
and
ran
wildly
down
the
stairs
the
outer
door
was
fastened
but
the
key
was
in
the
lock
as
she
paused
to
remove
it
she
could
hear
the
old
woman
frenzied
shrieks
of
anger
and
despair
on
realizing
her
situation
she
flung
the
door
open
flew
down
the
path
pushed
open
the
heavy
iron
gate
and
ran
wildly
down
the
lonely
country
road
the
afternoon
sun
beating
hotly
down
on
her
unprotected
head
the
dust
flying
thick
and
fast
beneath
the
rapid
of
her
small
slippered
feet
chapter
xii
she
was
free
she
was
free
that
happy
thought
beat
time
in
lily
heart
to
her
wildly
rushing
feet
she
was
outside
of
that
horrible
prison
old
haidee
was
locked
in
and
could
not
pursue
her
old
peter
could
not
return
for
several
hours
she
had
that
much
time
in
advance
of
them
only
a
few
miles
lay
between
her
and
her
loved
home
surely
surely
with
the
start
she
had
she
could
distance
her
enemies
and
reach
the
haven
of
rest
for
which
she
yearned
and
prayed
she
ran
on
and
on
her
brain
reeling
her
heart
beating
almost
to
suffocation
the
perspiration
running
down
her
face
in
streams
sheer
exhaustion
at
last
caused
her
to
slacken
her
pace
and
look
behind
her
at
the
lonely
stretch
of
road
over
which
her
flying
feet
had
swiftly
carried
her
the
old
house
in
which
she
had
passed
such
awful
hours
was
out
of
sight
a
turn
in
the
road
had
hidden
it
from
view
no
baleful
pursuer
was
on
her
track
yet
she
turned
and
looked
before
her
a
long
stretch
of
country
road
dotted
here
and
there
with
houses
lay
ahead
she
wet
her
handkerchief
in
a
rill
that
trickled
by
the
side
of
the
road
bound
it
about
her
throbbing
head
and
set
forward
again
steadily
but
at
a
less
swinging
pace
than
she
had
used
before
exhausted
nature
could
not
hold
out
at
the
rapid
rate
with
which
she
had
begun
on
and
on
she
went
through
the
blistering
sunshine
her
head
ached
the
hot
road
burnt
her
feet
the
warm
wind
blew
the
dust
into
her
strained
and
weary
eyes
no
matter
she
did
not
heed
these
trifling
things
she
was
free
that
was
the
glad
refrain
to
which
her
bounding
heart
kept
time
she
was
so
happy
she
could
not
realize
her
great
physical
weakness
and
weariness
it
seemed
to
her
at
last
that
hours
had
passed
since
she
had
set
forth
on
her
journey
carefully
following
some
directions
fanny
colville
had
given
her
the
houses
and
lots
began
to
stand
nearer
together
she
was
getting
nearer
to
the
great
city
she
began
to
be
afraid
that
she
would
meet
old
peter
leveret
returning
to
his
home
after
his
errand
to
doctor
pratt
at
last
she
came
to
a
little
house
standing
apart
from
the
others
she
peeped
in
and
saw
an
elderly
woman
sitting
at
the
open
door
sewing
on
a
coarse
garment
and
singing
blithely
at
her
task
she
opened
the
gate
and
went
up
to
her
will
you
let
me
come
in
and
rest
and
have
a
drink
of
water
said
she
gently
i
am
very
tired
the
woman
looked
up
in
surprise
god
knows
what
she
thought
of
the
poor
girl
standing
there
bareheaded
and
dusty
in
her
blue
morning
dress
looking
so
drooping
and
weary
but
she
moved
aside
and
said
kindly
yes
dear
heart
come
in
and
rest
and
have
a
bit
and
a
sup
you
look
as
if
you
needed
all
three
the
kind
words
and
gentle
smile
went
to
the
lonely
girl
heart
tears
started
into
her
eyes
as
she
took
the
offered
glass
of
water
and
drained
it
thirstily
i
thank
you
i
do
not
wish
anything
to
eat
she
answered
wearily
but
if
you
will
give
me
an
old
bonnet
i
will
be
glad
i
have
no
bonnet
you
see
and
an
old
dress
for
i
do
not
wish
to
go
into
the
city
with
this
i
will
pay
you
well
indeed
i
will
see
i
will
give
you
my
diamond
ring
the
woman
started
in
surprise
as
her
strange
visitant
turned
the
costly
ring
upon
her
finger
here
is
some
strange
mystery
she
thought
within
herself
the
girl
is
running
away
mayhap
and
wants
a
disguise
she
went
to
a
closet
and
brought
out
an
old
straw
hat
and
thick
veil
and
a
long
light
sack
somewhat
worn
i
will
not
take
your
ring
my
dear
she
said
kindly
you
may
take
these
things
though
and
welcome
maybe
i
am
doing
wrong
in
helping
you
to
run
away
but
then
again
i
may
be
doing
you
a
great
kindness
you
look
very
forlorn
my
poor
dear
lily
went
to
work
in
a
dazed
kind
of
way
putting
on
the
long
sack
over
her
dress
and
the
hat
on
her
head
this
done
she
wound
the
thick
veil
tightly
over
her
face
and
turned
to
go
i
thank
you
for
your
kindness
my
good
woman
she
said
i
will
come
back
here
some
time
and
reward
you
richly
i
will
indeed
now
i
am
going
if
anybody
comes
here
to
ask
about
me
be
sure
and
tell
them
i
have
not
been
here
do
not
let
them
know
whatever
else
she
was
going
to
say
died
unuttered
on
her
pale
lips
exhausted
nature
was
giving
away
she
threw
up
her
hands
wildly
staggered
forward
a
step
and
fell
fainting
on
the
floor
poor
soul
said
the
good
woman
kneeling
down
on
the
floor
and
loosening
the
hat
and
veil
from
her
head
she
is
dead
she
straightened
lily
out
upon
the
floor
and
dashed
cold
water
into
her
white
face
but
with
no
success
the
swoon
was
a
deep
one
and
it
was
fully
an
hour
before
the
girl
was
sufficiently
revived
to
be
lifted
up
by
the
woman
strong
arms
and
laid
upon
a
clean
white
bed
a
beauty
and
no
mistake
thought
the
creature
smoothing
back
the
damp
golden
ringlets
from
the
marble
white
brow
on
the
pillow
lily
large
blue
eyes
opened
and
looked
up
at
her
in
amaze
am
i
sick
have
i
been
here
long
she
inquired
struggling
up
to
a
sitting
posture
and
looking
out
through
the
window
anxiously
why
the
sun
is
setting
said
she
turning
her
bewildered
face
on
her
kind
attendant
yes
you
fainted
and
were
a
long
time
coming
to
was
the
answer
you
have
been
here
more
than
an
hour
lily
slipped
down
from
the
bed
and
began
to
put
on
her
hat
and
veil
with
trembling
hands
i
must
be
going
she
said
i
have
far
to
go
yet
and
it
is
growing
so
late
before
the
astonished
woman
could
remonstrate
she
was
out
of
the
house
going
slowly
on
her
way
she
was
so
weak
she
could
not
walk
very
fast
her
impetuous
will
alone
sustained
her
dragging
footsteps
thick
twilight
had
fallen
before
she
entered
the
busy
bustling
city
sorely
frightened
at
finding
herself
alone
in
the
gathering
darkness
yet
afraid
that
the
glare
of
the
gaslights
would
reveal
her
shrinking
form
to
her
pursuers
she
shrank
along
in
the
friendly
shadows
drawing
back
nervously
from
the
hurrying
forms
that
brushed
past
her
and
trembling
at
every
footstep
behind
her
but
in
spite
of
her
nervousness
she
at
length
entered
the
elegant
street
where
her
father
resided
all
was
gaiety
and
life
in
the
brilliant
houses
as
she
hurried
past
them
the
light
from
the
streamed
out
upon
her
shrinking
form
wild
and
entrancing
strains
of
music
filled
the
night
air
long
lines
of
carriages
were
drawn
up
in
front
of
some
of
the
houses
whose
owners
were
holding
balls
and
receptions
she
knew
them
all
they
were
all
friends
of
hers
but
she
flitted
past
them
like
a
spirit
pausing
not
in
her
frightened
yet
happy
course
until
she
stood
before
the
windows
of
her
father
handsome
mansion
these
windows
were
lighted
too
but
not
so
brightly
as
some
music
too
stole
through
them
but
it
was
soft
and
subdued
death
had
been
there
so
recently
they
had
not
the
heart
to
be
gay
she
thought
wild
with
her
joy
she
threw
off
her
disguising
hat
and
veil
and
running
up
the
broad
marble
steps
rang
the
bell
it
was
opened
by
the
stately
old
servitor
whom
she
had
been
accustomed
to
from
childhood
but
instead
of
welcoming
her
home
the
old
man
fled
wildly
down
the
hall
after
one
glance
into
her
lovely
white
face
he
takes
me
for
a
ghost
she
thought
laughing
and
running
after
him
down
the
wide
hall
till
she
reached
the
door
which
stood
open
for
coolness
that
sultry
night
she
stopped
in
the
doorway
framed
like
a
picture
in
the
hall
gaslights
and
looked
into
the
room
they
were
all
there
before
her
her
dear
ones
the
piano
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
its
back
towards
her
with
vance
on
the
directly
facing
her
her
white
hands
strayed
over
the
pearl
keys
and
lancelot
darling
stood
beside
her
and
turned
the
leaves
of
her
music
a
low
divan
was
drawn
near
them
and
ada
rested
upon
it
looking
very
fair
and
ethereal
in
her
deep
mourning
dress
her
father
sat
beside
her
looking
very
grave
and
sad
papa
papa
cried
poor
lily
in
a
choking
voice
the
passionate
cry
low
as
it
was
was
distinctly
heard
by
the
quartette
they
all
looked
up
and
saw
her
standing
there
in
the
light
with
her
wild
white
face
and
streaming
golden
hair
chapter

the
group
in
the
gazed
at
lily
for
a
moment
in
mingled
awe
and
consternation
but
suddenly
before
word
or
sound
broke
the
trance
of
silence
the
beautiful
picture
was
wholly
blotted
out
and
obliterated
by
a
blackness
of
darkness
that
filled
and
flooded
the
wide
hall
then
the
sound
of
women
screams
filled
the
grand
lily
lily
screamed
ada
throwing
herself
into
her
father
arms
while
vance
fell
writhing
upon
the
floor
shrieking
in
abject
terror
lancelot
darling
paused
a
moment
to
extricate
himself
from
the
clinging
hands
of
the
kneeling
woman
then
bounded
out
into
the
hall
darkness
met
him
only
as
he
ran
excitedly
up
and
down
its
length
there
was
no
one
there
the
front
door
standing
wide
open
attracted
his
attention
he
went
out
on
the
porch
and
looked
up
and
down
just
then
lawrence
came
out
and
joined
in
the
search
there
was
no
one
passing
they
went
in
and
found
willis
the
aged
servitor
who
had
returned
to
his
post
and
was
lighting
up
the
gas
again
willis
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
asked
sharply
the
hall
door
open
the
gas
out
and
you
absent
from
your
post
on
my
soul
lawrence
i
could
not
help
it
i
saw
a
ghost
said
the
man
looking
about
him
in
visible
trepidation
explain
yourself
said
his
master
sternly
i
went
to
answer
the
said
willis
trembling
and
when
i
opened
the
door
there
stood
a
ghost
all
in
white
looking
at
me
and
smiling
i
was
so
frightened
i
let
go
the
and
ran
away
i
beg
your
pardon
for
neglecting
my
duty
sir
and
leaving
the
door
ajar
concluded
the
man
humbly
what
sort
of
a
ghost
did
you
see
asked
mr
darling
the
man
eyes
grew
large
and
wild
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
tell
you
said
he
but
begging
your
pardon
lawrence
and
yours
mr
darling
it
was
the
spirit
of
our
poor
lost
miss
lily
lawrence
grew
pale
as
he
looked
at
the
man
come
lance
come
willis
he
said
we
will
search
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
there
is
some
mystery
here
which
we
may
penetrate
they
looked
into
every
room
and
closet
they
neglected
no
hiding
place
from
garret
to
cellar
but
no
one
either
ghost
or
being
was
discovered
lawrence
went
up
to
ada
room
to
see
if
she
were
recovering
from
her
agitation
she
was
lying
in
bed
pale
but
very
quiet
attended
by
her
maid
he
sent
the
girl
away
and
told
his
daughter
what
willis
had
seen
and
how
vainly
they
had
searched
the
house
papa
what
do
you
think
asked
she
in
low
tones
was
it
indeed
as
the
man
asserts
the
restless
spirit
of
my
sister
it
was
like
her
only
paler
and
more
shadowy
as
a
spirit
well
might
be
ada
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
said
her
father
in
low
moved
tones
i
am
lost
in
a
maze
of
doubt
and
conjecture
can
it
be
that
my
daughter
soul
can
not
rest
while
her
poor
desecrated
body
remains
uncoffined
it
may
be
so
said
ada
weeping
what
a
mournful
tone
was
in
that
voice
as
it
breathed
your
name
he
started
up
pacing
the
floor
in
wild
agitation
i
must
go
down
to
lance
he
said
we
will
go
and
see
the
detective
again
and
learn
if
any
clew
has
been
found
we
must
find
her
body
if
skill
and
money
combined
can
accomplish
it
i
can
not
bear
for
her
restless
soul
to
be
seeking
its
body
at
my
hands
vance
had
retired
to
her
room
in
a
state
of
abject
terror
she
believed
that
she
had
seen
and
heard
the
veritable
spirit
of
the
girl
she
had
murdered
instigated
thereto
by
jealousy
her
bold
and
venturesome
spirit
had
never
yet
felt
the
promptings
of
remorse
for
her
dreadful
deed
she
rejoiced
that
lily
was
dead
and
that
the
shameful
stigma
of
suicide
lay
upon
her
memory
though
she
was
the
daily
witness
of
the
bereaved
family
sorrow
though
she
saw
that
lancelot
darling
was
aged
as
if
ten
years
had
passed
over
his
head
in
the
past
few
weeks
still
she
felt
no
grief
for
her
sin
and
kept
on
her
resolute
way
swearing
in
her
secret
soul
to
win
the
young
man
whom
she
passionately
adored
and
whose
wealth
and
position
made
him
the
most
eligible
in
the
whole
city
love
and
ambition
alike
spurred
her
on
to
the
attainment
of
her
cherished
object
but
the
dreadful
revelation
of
old
haidee
had
struck
a
lightning
flash
of
terror
to
her
guilty
soul
she
had
believed
herself
secure
in
her
sin
she
had
thought
it
known
only
to
herself
of
all
the
world
and
the
knowledge
that
her
secret
belonged
to
another
had
almost
crazed
her
with
the
fear
of
its
betrayal
she
regretted
that
she
had
not
followed
the
old
witch
home
that
day
and
struck
another
secret
blow
that
would
have
sealed
the
old
woman
lips
forever
she
who
had
struck
down
so
ruthlessly
the
fair
and
blooming
life
of
lily
lawrence
would
have
felt
no
compunction
in
ending
prematurely
the
old
and
existence
of
haidee
leveret
all
that
she
lacked
was
the
chance
now
another
scathing
monition
had
been
hurled
against
her
guilty
conscience
in
the
hour
when
old
haidee
continued
silence
and
absence
had
begun
to
inspire
her
with
confidence
again
when
the
wooing
tones
had
brought
lancelot
darling
to
her
side
when
she
could
almost
feel
his
breath
upon
her
cheek
as
he
bent
to
turn
the
pages
of
her
music
in
that
supreme
hour
the
image
of
the
woman
she
hated
had
risen
to
blast
her
sight
and
to
come
between
her
and
the
love
she
sought
it
was
horrible
it
was
maddening
she
sought
her
solitary
apartment
and
flung
herself
face
downward
on
the
bed
afraid
to
lift
her
heavy
eyes
lest
they
should
be
blasted
by
the
sight
of
the
restless
spirit
which
her
guilty
hand
had
driven
forth
a
wanderer
from
the
fair
citadel
it
once
inhabited
do
the
dead
walk
she
said
to
herself
in
fearful
agitation
do
they
revisit
the
haunts
of
life
and
love
do
they
ever
return
and
denounce
their
murderers
oh
god
why
do
i
ask
myself
these
fruitless
questions
do
i
not
know
have
i
not
looked
upon
the
face
of
the
dead
this
night
ah
what
if
she
had
pointed
a
ghostly
finger
at
me
and
said
before
them
all
art
my
murderess
shivering
as
if
with
the
ague
she
buried
her
head
in
the
a
sudden
rap
at
the
door
caused
her
to
start
violently
enter
said
she
almost
inaudibly
it
was
only
one
of
the
neat
housemaids
she
looked
concerned
at
the
ghastly
white
face
the
widow
lifted
on
her
entrance
are
you
ill
mrs
vance
she
inquired
no
yes
that
is
my
head
aches
badly
was
the
confused
answer
the
maid
had
heard
the
story
of
the
ghostly
visitor
from
willis
and
rightly
attributed
the
agitation
of
the
lady
to
that
cause
she
did
not
allude
to
it
however
as
vance
did
not
she
simply
said
i
found
this
trinket
in
the
hall
as
i
was
passing
through
it
vance
i
have
shown
it
to
miss
lawrence
but
she
does
not
know
anything
about
it
so
i
came
to
ask
if
it
belonged
to
you
she
held
the
piece
of
gold
in
her
hand
vance
arose
and
examined
it
by
the
light
it
was
the
broken
half
of
a
golden
locket
such
as
gentlemen
wear
on
their
it
was
of
costly
workmanship
richly
chased
with
a
delicate
monogram
set
in
minute
diamonds
the
intertwined
letters
were
it
does
not
belong
to
me
mary
answered
vance
it
has
probably
broken
off
from
some
gentleman
and
dropped
as
he
was
passing
through
the
hall
but
i
do
not
know
to
whom
it
can
belong
we
have
had
no
visitors
and
indeed
i
can
not
recollect
any
acquaintance
we
have
with
the
initials
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
it
i
shall
ask
lawrence
to
take
charge
of
it
as
soon
as
he
returns
replied
mary
it
may
be
that
he
can
find
the
owner
it
is
quite
valuable
is
it
not
yes
it
has
some
value
mary
the
monogram
is
set
with
real
diamonds
though
they
are
very
small
it
evidently
belongs
to
a
person
of
some
means
said
vance
returning
the
trinket
to
mary
hand
the
trim
little
maid
said
a
polite
and
tripped
away
with
the
jewel
carefully
wrapped
in
a
handkerchief
vance
with
her
thoughts
turned
into
a
new
channel
sat
musing
thoughtfully
over
the
little
incident
the
longer
she
thought
it
over
the
more
mysterious
it
appeared
to
whom
can
it
belong
said
she
to
herself
no
gentlemen
at
all
have
called
here
can
it
have
any
connection
with
our
mysterious
visitation
chapter
xiv
lawrence
detailed
to
the
special
detective
shelton
the
particulars
of
his
daughter
appearance
that
evening
he
was
listened
to
with
the
closest
attention
when
he
had
concluded
his
story
the
detective
said
respectfully
i
am
a
very
practical
man
lawrence
and
my
profession
only
makes
me
more
so
when
i
am
brought
in
contact
with
a
mystery
i
invariably
suspect
crime
and
i
must
tell
you
that
i
do
not
believe
in
the
visionary
nature
of
the
girl
you
saw
in
your
hall
this
evening
i
am
not
a
believer
in
the
supernatural
what
then
is
your
opinion
of
the
phenomenon
inquired
lawrence
that
it
was
no
phenomenon
at
all
answered
shelton
smiling
it
was
palpably
an
attempt
at
robbery
some
girl
with
a
resemblance
to
your
lost
daughter
was
employed
to
frighten
off
the
man
at
the
door
while
her
accomplices
entered
the
hall
turned
off
the
light
and
perpetrated
a
burglary
but
there
was
nothing
stolen
objected
lawrence
the
house
was
searched
immediately
for
i
had
an
idea
rather
similar
to
yours
at
first
but
nothing
had
been
taken
nor
was
there
any
person
concealed
in
the
house
the
detective
smiled
blandly
in
the
comfortable
knowledge
of
his
own
superior
wisdom
the
thieves
were
only
frightened
off
that
time
said
he
they
will
come
again
feeling
secure
in
the
belief
that
the
girl
played
the
ghost
to
perfection
the
next
time
do
not
be
frightened
but
make
an
instant
effort
to
capture
her
and
she
can
soon
be
forced
to
reveal
her
accomplices
you
have
learned
nothing
yet
about
the
asked
lawrence
dismissing
the
first
subject
thinking
it
quite
possible
that
shelton
exposition
of
the
case
was
a
very
correct
one
i
have
found
the
first
link
in
the
chain
said
the
detective
brightening
up
you
have
said
the
banker
gladly
it
is
a
very
slight
clew
though
said
shelton
i
would
not
have
you
build
your
hopes
on
it
lawrence
for
it
may
not
lead
to
anything
the
case
is
a
very
mysterious
one
and
so
far
has
completely
baffled
thorough
investigation
but
that
you
have
discovered
anything
at
all
is
an
earnest
of
hope
said
the
banker
slight
things
lead
to
great
discoveries
sometimes
will
you
give
us
the
benefit
of
your
discovery
it
must
be
held
in
the
strictest
confidence
said
shelton
looking
from
lawrence
to
mr
darling
who
had
sat
quite
silent
throughout
the
interview
of
course
you
know
that
if
suffered
to
get
abroad
it
would
put
the
guilty
party
on
their
guard
both
gentlemen
promised
that
they
would
preserve
inviolable
secrecy
briefly
then
i
have
learned
that
the
sexton
was
bribed
to
lend
out
the
key
of
your
vault
the
night
of
the
funeral
mr
lawrence
the
villain
said
lawrence
hotly
softly
said
the
detective
he
is
not
so
bad
as
you
think
his
error
lay
in
the
possession
of
a
soft
heart
unfortunately
abetted
by
a
soft
head
i
fail
to
catch
your
meaning
said
the
banker
i
mean
said
the
detective
that
poor
old
man
had
no
thought
or
dream
of
abetting
a
robbery
his
consent
was
most
reluctantly
forced
from
him
by
the
sighs
and
protestations
of
a
pretended
lover
who
only
desired
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
look
once
more
on
the
beloved
face
of
the
dead
the
sighing
romeo
prevailed
over
the
old
man
scruples
with
his
frantic
appeals
and
obtained
the
key
rewarding
the
sexton
with
all
a
lover
generosity
it
was
returned
to
him
in
a
short
while
and
so
implicit
was
his
faith
in
the
romantic
lover
that
he
never
even
looked
in
the
vault
to
see
if
all
was
secure
the
shocking
discovery
made
the
following
day
by
mr
darling
and
yourself
so
appalled
him
with
its
possibilities
of
harm
to
himself
that
he
feared
to
reveal
the
fact
of
his
unconscious
complicity
in
the
theft
yet
he
revealed
it
to
you
said
lawrence
the
detectives
are
a
shrewd
lot
for
worming
secrets
out
of
people
said
shelton
with
one
of
his
smiles
i
used
much
with
the
old
man
before
i
made
my
discovery
i
suppose
i
may
feel
safe
in
supposing
that
you
will
not
molest
him
at
the
present
critical
time
much
depends
on
secrecy
the
case
is
in
your
hands
rest
assured
i
shall
not
make
any
disastrous
move
in
it
returned
lawrence
reassuringly
one
thing
further
said
shelton
i
learned
that
the
man
who
enacted
the
hypocritical
of
the
despairing
lover
was
tall
and
dark
but
have
not
succeeded
in
identifying
him
yet
that
is
the
meager
extent
of
my
information
at
present
i
hope
and
trust
it
may
soon
lead
to
an
entire
elucidation
of
the
mystery
said
the
banker
rising
to
leave
i
will
report
all
discoveries
tending
that
way
immediately
sir
answered
the
detective
bowing
his
visitors
out
of
the
office
how
are
you
impressed
with
shelton
powers
as
a
detective
lance
asked
lawrence
as
they
walked
on
a
few
blocks
before
hailing
a
car
i
believe
he
is
an
able
man
but
i
am
not
prepared
to
subscribe
to
his
theory
of
the
event
which
happened
was
the
somewhat
hesitating
reply
of
the
young
man
you
are
not
what
then
is
your
opinion
asked
the
banker
in
some
surprise
lawrence
i
believe
that
it
was
really
and
truly
our
lost
lily
whom
we
beheld
said
lancelot
earnestly
really
and
truly
our
lily
come
lance
you
talk
wildly
has
your
affliction
turned
your
brain
poor
boy
recollect
that
lily
is
dead
i
know
i
know
who
could
realize
that
fact
more
forcibly
than
i
do
but
my
dear
friend
i
did
not
mean
that
it
was
lily
in
the
flesh
what
i
meant
was
that
lily
spirit
the
better
part
of
her
which
is
imperishable
really
and
truly
appeared
to
us
said
the
young
man
who
was
of
a
very
impressive
and
imaginative
cast
of
mind
lawrence
regarded
him
curiously
but
why
should
you
persist
in
this
belief
lance
when
the
clever
shelton
has
so
clearly
shown
us
the
fallacy
of
the
idea
he
has
not
shown
us
the
fallacy
of
the
idea
at
all
answered
lancelot
darling
earnestly
as
before
he
has
only
given
us
his
practical
theory
regarding
it
have
you
any
conjecture
regarding
her
object
in
so
appearing
to
us
if
indeed
you
take
the
right
view
of
the
matter
lance
asked
the
banker
impressed
by
the
serious
manner
of
his
young
friend
i
have
not
thought
of
it
lawrence
i
have
no
distinct
or
tangible
impression
at
all
except
this
one
which
is
indelibly
fixed
on
my
mind
i
believe
that
the
pure
white
soul
of
lily
lawrence
looked
out
visibly
upon
us
from
the
eyes
of
the
girl
whom
we
saw
in
the
hall
i
can
not
be
mistaken
my
soul
leaped
forth
to
meet
hers
as
it
could
not
have
done
for
any
other
woman
mortal
or
immortal
replied
the
loyal
lover
earnestly
well
here
is
my
car
said
the
banker
hastening
to
signal
it
sir
said
lance
turning
a
corner
and
going
down
the
street
toward
his
hotel
to
pass
the
weary
night
in
restless
tossing
and
sleeplessness
while
visions
of
his
beautiful
lost
love
haunted
his
feverish
brain
until
he
was
driven
to
madness
lawrence
went
back
to
the
detective
next
day
with
the
costly
broken
jewel
that
mary
the
housemaid
had
found
in
the
hall
he
explained
to
shelton
that
no
gentleman
had
called
at
the
house
the
day
previous
except
mr
darling
who
said
he
had
never
seen
it
before
this
confirms
my
view
of
the
case
said
shelton
triumphantly
did
i
not
say
that
the
girl
had
one
or
more
accomplices
this
was
probably
dropped
by
the
man
in
his
hurried
flight
yet
it
would
seem
to
have
belonged
to
a
person
of
taste
and
wealth
such
a
one
would
not
be
engaged
in
burglary
the
mystery
only
deepens
but
may
not
this
be
a
clew
by
which
to
discover
the
perpetrators
of
the
dastardly
act
inquired
the
banker
it
ought
to
do
so
said
the
detective
frankly
he
remained
lost
in
thought
a
few
moments
then
inquired
have
you
any
acquaintance
who
can
claim
these
initials
mr
lawrence
let
me
think
my
circle
of
acquaintance
is
large
but
i
can
not
recall
anyone
claiming
as
his
monogram
my
memory
may
not
serve
me
correctly
though
perhaps
your
may
do
better
lawrence
will
you
examine
that
and
let
me
know
certainly
suppose
you
accompany
me
and
let
us
find
out
at
once
i
do
not
feel
disposed
to
let
this
vexing
matter
rest
with
pleasure
as
i
have
a
leisure
hour
at
my
disposal
they
returned
to
the
house
together
and
entered
at
once
upon
their
quest
it
was
not
long
before
their
labors
were
rewarded
with
success
the
detective
looked
up
with
a
small
square
of
pasteboard
in
his
hand
from
which
he
read
aloud
triumphantly
harold
colville
harold
colville
exclaimed
the
banker
why
really
i
had
forgotten
mr
colville
he
visits
here
then
of
course
said
the
detective
he
did
at
one
time
frequently
latterly
he
has
discontinued
his
visits
indeed
it
has
been
four
or
five
months
since
he
called
upon
us
had
he
any
reason
for
the
cessation
of
his
visits
yes
said
the
banker
promptly
he
was
a
suitor
for
the
hand
of
my
daughter
lily
she
rejected
him
being
already
engaged
to
mr
darling
i
have
seen
colville
said
shelton
he
is
a
man
of
wealth
and
leisure
dissipated
and
fast
i
have
heard
you
have
been
correctly
informed
was
the
reply
indeed
said
shelton
he
laid
the
card
back
as
he
spoke
and
rose
to
take
leave
does
this
discovery
throw
any
light
on
the
mystery
said
the
other
i
will
be
frank
with
you
lawrence
it
does
not
the
case
seems
complicated
at
present
but
it
is
my
business
to
unravel
the
crooked
skein
and
i
hope
to
do
so
you
will
suffer
me
to
retain
this
bit
of
jewelry
for
the
present
i
wish
to
see
if
colville
can
furnish
the
missing
half
you
suspect
him
then
said
the
banker
breaking
off
his
sentence
because
perplexed
how
to
end
it
i
suspect
him
of
nothing
at
present
was
the
reply
this
trinket
may
have
been
stolen
from
him
and
lost
by
another
i
have
that
to
find
out
if
it
be
proved
that
colville
lost
this
locket
in
your
hall
last
night
my
theory
of
a
projected
theft
will
not
hold
water
a
gentleman
of
his
wealth
and
position
would
not
need
to
descend
to
that
phase
of
crime
some
other
object
must
have
actuated
him
he
paused
drawing
on
his
gloves
there
is
one
thing
more
he
resumed
keep
this
mutual
discovery
we
have
made
a
dead
secret
until
i
give
you
leave
to
reveal
it
do
not
even
mention
it
to
your
daughter
or
to
mr
darling
he
does
not
believe
the
theory
i
advanced
last
night
i
read
it
in
his
expressive
features
he
thinks
he
really
saw
a
spirit
let
him
think
so
still
i
am
gathering
the
tangled
ends
of
a
fearful
mystery
in
my
hands
but
if
human
skill
can
unravel
it
i
will
not
fail
to
do
so
mr
lawrence
he
tripped
airily
away
down
the
street
with
the
air
and
manner
of
a
gentleman
few
who
saw
the
man
swinging
his
natty
little
cane
so
jauntily
and
wearing
that
supremely
indifferent
air
would
have
supposed
him
to
be
the
most
daring
and
accomplished
detective
in
the
state
of
new
york
so
thought
lawrence
as
he
watched
him
walk
away
chapter
xv
the
rage
of
old
haidee
leveret
at
finding
herself
duped
and
outwitted
by
such
a
weak
girl
as
lily
lawrence
was
frightful
to
witness
and
impossible
to
describe
she
raved
she
stormed
she
tore
her
scanty
gray
locks
and
blasphemed
in
the
most
frightful
and
terms
in
vain
she
tried
the
in
vain
she
shook
the
iron
bars
in
the
window
they
resisted
her
most
vigorous
efforts
in
her
terrible
rage
she
fell
to
breaking
and
tearing
everything
in
her
room
that
could
be
destroyed
she
threw
down
the
dishes
containing
lily
untasted
dinner
and
shivered
them
into
fragments
she
tore
off
the
and
rent
them
in
pieces
in
the
hight
of
her
insane
fury
if
lily
had
fallen
into
her
cruel
hands
just
then
she
would
have
killed
her
remorselessly
at
length
having
sated
her
rage
momentarily
by
wreaking
it
on
those
poor
inanimate
things
she
began
to
quiet
down
somewhat
and
to
consider
the
situation
the
enemy
had
worsted
her
that
was
stratagem
had
succeeded
against
brute
force
and
power
lily
lawrence
had
freed
herself
from
captivity
and
there
was
no
one
to
pursue
her
and
bring
her
back
old
peter
was
not
likely
to
return
for
several
hours
if
lily
strength
held
out
she
would
be
safe
in
her
home
ere
the
old
man
could
get
back
to
town
and
carry
the
tidings
to
doctor
pratt
and
harold
colville
harold
colville
had
promised
the
old
couple
a
most
extravagant
reward
for
the
of
his
beautiful
prisoner
not
only
did
the
loss
of
this
trouble
the
old
crone
mind
but
also
the
fact
that
lily
would
betray
them
all
into
the
hands
of
the
police
and
that
exposure
and
punishment
would
follow
on
the
discovery
of
the
nefarious
works
which
she
and
her
husband
had
wrought
for
years
a
species
of
abject
terror
filled
her
quaking
frame
at
the
thought
she
thought
of
the
miserly
accumulations
of
her
wicked
life
secreted
beneath
the
roof
of
the
old
house
and
dreaded
lest
her
greedy
eyes
should
never
again
be
permitted
to
gloat
over
that
golden
hoard
in
the
hight
of
these
woful
cogitations
her
thoughts
suddenly
recurred
to
the
prisoner
in
the
gloomy
dungeon
beneath
her
poor
fanny
colville
whose
hearing
had
been
strained
all
day
to
detect
the
faintest
sound
from
above
had
been
a
frightened
listener
to
old
haidee
fearful
explosion
of
wrath
she
knew
by
the
violence
of
the
witch
rage
that
lily
had
succeeded
in
her
stratagem
and
effected
her
escape
the
knowledge
filled
her
with
joy
even
while
she
feared
that
rage
would
instigate
haidee
to
yet
further
cruelties
against
herself
the
desire
for
life
was
yet
strong
in
the
breast
of
the
poor
starving
creature
and
she
shrank
in
terror
while
she
thought
it
was
probable
that
old
haidee
would
kill
her
in
her
frantic
desire
to
wreak
vengeance
upon
something
even
while
she
shivered
over
her
fear
she
heard
the
heavy
footsteps
lumbering
down
the
stairs
toward
the
dungeon
what
are
you
not
dead
yet
you
was
the
fierce
salutation
that
greeted
her
ears
her
enemy
advanced
and
seizing
hold
of
her
crouching
body
as
it
lay
upon
the
bed
shook
it
with
the
fury
of
a
until
it
seemed
as
if
the
poor
bones
must
rattle
what
do
you
mean
by
living
in
this
way
must
i
kill
you
at
last
with
my
own
hands
spare
me
moaned
the
poor
victim
between
her
chattering
teeth
spare
me
yet
a
little
longer
i
am
so
young
and
life
is
so
sweet
sweet
you
fool
cried
the
old
hag
desisting
from
sheer
weariness
and
letting
go
of
the
poor
skeleton
to
glare
fiercely
at
her
what
life
is
sweet
chained
in
a
dungeon
in
rags
on
a
crust
of
bread
and
a
sup
of
water
yes
oh
yes
faltered
the
poor
creature
hoping
to
gain
a
little
time
so
that
deliverance
from
her
bonds
might
come
live
then
you
worm
cried
the
old
witch
throwing
life
at
her
poor
victim
with
a
curse
live
as
long
as
you
can
since
you
find
it
such
a
luxury
the
shivering
heap
of
rags
and
bones
did
not
answer
stamping
about
the
floor
glaring
at
the
frightened
fanny
her
mood
changed
she
said
retrospectively
after
all
you
are
not
such
a
devil
as
she
you
have
not
the
spirit
in
your
poor
crushed
beaten
body
you
have
never
even
tried
to
escape
from
me
and
bring
me
to
punishment
why
should
i
tread
on
you
when
you
will
not
even
turn
like
the
worm
no
live
live
never
fear
but
you
shall
have
your
crust
of
bread
and
sup
of
water
while
haidee
remains
here
to
bring
it
to
you
so
saying
she
went
out
again
and
fanny
wept
tears
of
joy
at
her
departure
but
a
little
while
now
she
thought
gladly
and
lily
would
be
at
home
then
at
the
farthest
her
own
deliverance
would
arrive
she
thought
of
the
loved
ones
she
had
never
expected
to
see
again
of
the
dear
old
mother
and
father
in
their
old
home
in
the
country
and
the
affectionate
girl
tears
flowed
like
rain
for
very
joy
at
the
blissful
hope
of
reunion
alas
poor
fanny
it
seemed
many
hours
to
haidee
before
her
husband
and
doctor
pratt
returned
it
was
very
near
sunset
for
doctor
pratt
had
been
absent
visiting
a
patient
and
peter
had
been
forced
to
await
his
return
when
at
last
they
came
and
knocked
at
the
door
she
had
to
inform
them
with
a
curse
for
every
word
of
lily
escape
then
they
were
compelled
to
force
the
door
open
for
the
brave
girl
had
taken
the
key
with
her
and
thrown
it
away
in
the
road
as
soon
as
doctor
pratt
heard
her
story
he
sprang
into
the
buggy
and
drove
into
the
city
with
furious
haste
in
search
of
colville
it
was
late
before
he
found
him
so
that
lily
was
almost
home
before
he
learned
the
story
i
suppose
it
is
all
up
with
us
now
said
colville
after
swearing
an
oath
or
two
and
we
had
better
be
getting
away
from
town
before
we
are
arrested
i
suppose
she
is
at
home
by
now
there
is
only
one
chance
in
ten
that
she
is
not
was
the
reply
her
excessive
weakness
may
have
caused
her
to
fall
by
the
way
it
seems
impossible
that
one
so
debilitated
by
sickness
should
take
so
long
a
walk
without
resting
you
think
there
is
a
chance
of
her
recapture
then
inquired
colville
eagerly
there
may
be
was
the
cautious
reply
you
see
if
she
is
yet
on
the
road
we
can
watch
for
her
near
her
home
and
as
it
is
getting
dark
it
would
be
very
easy
to
seize
her
and
put
her
into
a
waiting
carriage
after
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
chloroform
would
stifle
her
screams
while
we
drove
back
to
leveret
with
her
but
the
carriage
driver
doctor
might
he
not
betray
us
i
will
drive
my
own
carriage
answered
pratt
we
will
stop
near
the
corner
of
lawrence
house
you
will
then
get
out
and
watch
for
her
if
she
should
appear
you
will
hastily
throw
a
cloak
over
her
head
and
carry
her
to
the
carriage
well
planned
doctor
let
us
be
going
at
once
every
moment
is
precious
in
this
extremity
we
must
first
purchase
a
bottle
of
chloroform
a
sponge
and
a
long
cloak
in
which
to
envelope
her
form
said
the
doctor
recollecting
precautions
which
colville
in
his
impetuosity
was
about
forgetting
these
purchases
were
hastily
made
and
the
two
worthies
stepped
into
the
doctor
light
carriage
and
drove
rapidly
away
on
their
mission
of
evil
they
were
not
a
minute
too
soon
as
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
corner
a
slight
form
hurried
past
plainly
visible
in
the
light
of
the
it
is
she
said
pratt
in
a
hasty
whisper
he
recognized
her
graceful
form
in
spite
of
the
disguising
veil
and
sack
colville
was
stung
to
madness
by
the
sight
i
will
have
her
he
declared
with
a
terrible
oath
if
i
have
to
tear
her
from
the
arms
of
her
lover
he
sprang
out
and
followed
her
she
had
gone
up
the
steps
and
rung
the
bell
just
as
he
came
opposite
the
steps
he
saw
old
willis
open
the
door
and
witnessed
his
headlong
flight
from
the
supposed
spirit
of
his
young
mistress
as
she
glided
into
the
house
he
ran
lightly
up
the
steps
and
followed
her
she
heard
the
footsteps
of
her
pursuer
and
faintly
moaned
papa
papa
but
in
that
moment
ere
assistance
could
reach
her
the
gaslights
were
turned
out
by
a
steady
hand
she
was
plucked
backward
by
the
skirt
of
her
dress
and
fell
into
colville
arms
so
muffled
by
the
heavy
cloak
he
threw
over
her
that
she
could
not
breathe
hardly
clogged
by
the
light
burden
in
his
arms
he
ran
through
the
hall
and
down
the
steps
before
lancelot
darling
reached
the
door
it
was
but
the
work
of
a
moment
to
reach
the
carriage
and
give
his
captive
into
the
ready
arms
he
then
sprang
in
himself
and
drove
rapidly
away
with
their
beautiful
captive
chapter
xvi
lily
awakened
from
the
temporary
stupor
induced
by
chloroform
and
found
herself
a
prisoner
again
in
the
old
familiar
room
she
was
lying
on
the
bed
and
doctor
pratt
grim
and
as
usual
sat
by
the
side
harold
colville
was
also
an
occupant
of
the
room
and
haidee
leveret
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
gave
her
a
fiendish
scowl
in
answer
to
the
glance
she
cast
upon
her
how
do
you
feel
after
your
journey
this
evening
inquired
the
physician
with
a
sarcastic
smile
a
glance
of
scorn
from
lily
eyes
fell
upon
him
she
did
not
vouchsafe
him
any
reply
i
think
you
must
begin
to
realize
by
this
time
that
it
is
quite
impossible
for
you
to
escape
from
us
continued
doctor
pratt
you
have
now
made
two
attempts
which
have
resulted
in
nothing
except
to
make
us
more
vigilant
than
before
in
keeping
you
safely
secured
hereafter
you
will
be
doubly
guarded
by
haidee
and
peter
he
will
accompany
her
and
stand
outside
the
room
door
whenever
she
has
any
business
within
you
are
aware
that
the
window
is
too
heavily
and
strongly
barred
for
you
to
tamper
with
it
you
now
see
that
there
is
no
possible
chance
for
you
to
make
a
third
attempt
to
elude
us
there
was
no
reply
lily
still
regarded
him
with
a
flashing
gaze
full
of
scorn
and
contempt
but
the
villain
went
on
in
disconcerted
by
her
anger
it
seems
to
me
miss
lawrence
that
your
best
and
wisest
course
would
be
to
thankfully
accept
colville
proposals
of
marriage
surely
that
can
not
be
such
a
terrible
thing
to
do
there
are
many
ladies
who
would
be
proud
of
the
honor
which
he
seeks
to
force
upon
you
your
former
home
is
forever
lost
to
you
you
are
as
one
dead
to
your
family
they
have
seen
you
laid
away
in
the
tomb
if
you
went
to
them
now
they
would
not
believe
that
you
belonged
to
them
they
would
scout
your
story
as
impossible
and
yourself
as
an
impostor
there
remains
therefore
but
one
possible
chance
of
restoration
to
your
friends
and
to
liberty
and
that
is
to
appear
before
them
in
the
character
of
harold
colville
colville
has
already
had
an
answer
to
his
proposals
answered
lily
firmly
i
will
die
before
i
accept
liberty
on
these
terms
do
not
allow
any
scruples
in
regard
to
mr
darling
to
influence
your
decision
interrupted
colville
speaking
for
the
first
time
for
i
can
assure
you
on
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
miss
lawrence
that
he
has
transferred
his
fickle
affections
to
the
wily
widow
who
tried
to
murder
you
in
order
that
she
might
steal
into
his
heart
and
win
his
hand
and
fortune
it
is
false
lancelot
has
not
forgotten
me
so
soon
cried
lily
warmly
but
though
she
defended
her
lover
loyalty
so
bravely
there
flashed
over
her
mind
a
remembrance
of
the
scene
she
had
momentarily
witnessed
last
night
vance
at
the
grand
piano
playing
and
singing
softly
her
lover
her
handsome
kingly
lancelot
bending
over
her
as
he
turned
the
pages
of
her
music
she
had
thought
nothing
of
it
then
but
in
the
light
of
harold
colville
bold
assertion
it
seemed
to
her
terribly
significant
i
do
not
wonder
that
my
assertion
taxes
your
credulity
returned
colville
with
a
maddening
smile
it
seemed
almost
beyond
belief
when
it
first
came
to
my
knowledge
not
yet
three
months
from
your
supposed
death
i
can
scarcely
understand
how
the
man
who
lacked
but
a
few
hours
of
being
your
husband
could
console
himself
with
the
smiles
of
another
so
soon
but
he
is
young
and
impressible
and
i
grant
you
she
is
rarely
beautiful
and
gifted
with
consummate
art
i
can
add
my
testimony
to
colville
assertion
said
doctor
pratt
your
lover
has
indeed
been
beguiled
into
forgetfulness
of
his
grief
by
the
fascination
of
the
charming
widow
they
are
now
acknowledged
lovers
i
do
not
believe
it
answered
lily
proudly
do
you
think
i
would
take
your
word
harold
colville
or
yours
doctor
pratt
for
the
truth
you
have
proved
yourselves
villains
and
i
do
not
place
the
least
confidence
in
your
assertions
you
tell
me
these
things
believing
i
will
the
more
readily
yield
to
your
wishes
but
you
are
mistaken
sadly
mistaken
i
tell
you
now
that
if
lancelot
darling
should
marry
vance
it
would
not
make
any
difference
in
my
rejection
of
a
villain
suit
both
the
worthies
glared
at
her
with
fierce
wrath
so
be
it
said
colville
angrily
but
remember
you
will
remain
a
prisoner
until
you
accede
to
my
wishes
no
matter
how
long
you
hold
out
haidee
you
need
not
provide
so
sumptuously
for
so
contumacious
a
captive
let
bread
and
water
be
her
portion
until
her
rebellious
spirit
is
broken
i
will
see
her
again
in
a
month
time
come
doctor
come
haidee
let
us
leave
her
to
the
pleasures
of
solitary
contemplation
all
three
retired
the
door
which
had
been
provided
with
another
key
was
securely
locked
and
she
was
left
again
in
her
loneliness
and
bitter
sorrow
weak
and
weary
with
her
long
journey
and
unbroken
fast
she
lay
still
her
limbs
aching
with
fatigue
and
her
heart
almost
broken
with
sorrow
her
momentary
glimpse
of
her
dear
ones
had
filled
her
heart
with
a
wild
flood
of
new
tenderness
for
them
she
had
come
back
to
them
from
the
dead
and
she
felt
that
they
would
have
been
filled
with
the
deepest
joy
in
receiving
her
again
she
had
been
so
cruelly
torn
from
them
in
the
very
moment
when
they
first
caught
sight
of
her
she
wondered
what
they
would
think
perhaps
they
will
share
old
willis
delusion
that
it
was
a
spirit
thought
she
with
a
flood
of
tears
she
had
almost
forgotten
fanny
in
the
bitter
anguish
of
being
retaken
thus
in
the
very
moment
of
impending
with
her
family
but
presently
she
heard
the
clank
of
the
poor
captive
chain
as
she
turned
restlessly
on
her
hard
bed
and
caught
the
sound
of
her
groans
poor
fanny
she
thought
how
will
she
bear
this
sad
disappointment
when
she
hoped
so
much
from
my
escape
weak
and
trembling
she
rose
from
the
bed
and
taking
the
lamp
in
her
hand
staggeringly
descended
the
stairs
in
quest
of
her
poor
companion
in
captivity
and
sorrow
fanny
lay
extended
on
the
cot
moaning
piteously
she
cried
out
in
surprise
and
terror
fearing
that
haidee
had
returned
to
threaten
and
abuse
her
but
she
soon
saw
that
it
was
the
sweet
face
of
the
captive
girl
that
beamed
upon
her
my
god
miss
lawrence
is
it
you
she
said
i
thought
i
hoped
that
you
had
escaped
lily
threw
herself
down
upon
the
hard
stone
floor
and
wept
piteously
the
trial
was
hard
upon
herself
as
affecting
her
own
individual
welfare
now
the
burden
of
this
poor
creature
sorrow
added
to
the
weight
of
her
own
made
it
almost
insupportable
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
summon
sufficient
calmness
to
relate
her
mournful
story
to
the
suffering
creature
it
is
all
over
she
said
in
conclusion
there
is
no
hope
of
escape
from
our
prison
and
death
is
before
us
fanny
lay
still
moaning
now
and
then
in
pain
she
made
no
attempt
to
rise
and
at
last
lily
noticed
the
fact
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
poor
soul
said
she
are
you
worse
are
you
unable
to
rise
i
can
not
raise
my
head
answered
the
poor
girl
patiently
my
poor
bones
have
been
shaken
and
beaten
terribly
by
old
haidee
i
am
very
stiff
and
sore
as
well
as
she
could
she
related
the
story
of
old
haidee
rage
at
her
captive
escape
her
descent
into
the
dungeon
and
her
wild
onslaught
on
her
starving
captive
lily
wept
at
the
recital
of
fanny
sufferings
she
was
wreaking
her
rage
at
my
escape
upon
you
poor
fanny
said
she
oh
god
why
dost
thou
allow
the
wicked
thus
to
triumph
over
the
weak
and
the
innocent
are
you
much
hurt
do
you
think
you
can
survive
it
she
asked
presently
in
anxious
tones
i
do
know
i
am
very
sore
at
present
there
seems
very
little
life
left
in
me
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
i
should
die
said
the
poor
creature
despondently
the
little
spark
of
hope
awakened
in
her
breast
by
lily
escape
was
dead
now
and
despair
had
claimed
her
for
its
own
lily
knelt
by
the
cot
and
felt
her
hands
they
were
cold
and
clammy
and
chilly
dews
stood
upon
the
wasted
brow
lily
started
could
this
be
death
that
was
stealing
over
the
poor
captive
she
feared
it
was
but
she
was
afraid
to
linger
longer
lest
old
haidee
should
find
her
out
she
rose
reluctantly
i
wish
i
could
stay
with
you
fanny
said
she
it
seems
hard
to
leave
you
suffering
thus
alone
but
if
old
haidee
should
find
me
she
might
kill
you
for
fear
i
should
betray
her
so
it
seems
that
i
must
go
lily
took
the
poor
wasted
hand
and
pressing
it
gently
went
away
fearing
that
the
few
sands
of
life
remaining
to
harold
injured
wife
were
fast
running
out
chapter
xvii
about
a
month
subsequent
to
the
events
which
have
been
related
in
the
last
chapter
vance
and
ada
lawrence
sat
alone
in
the
of
their
splendid
home
ada
had
been
reading
but
the
volume
seemed
to
have
little
interest
for
it
had
fallen
from
her
hands
to
the
floor
and
she
was
reclining
on
a
luxurious
divan
looking
bored
and
sad
while
now
and
then
a
low
sigh
rippled
across
her
coral
lips
she
was
very
lovely
being
a
pure
blonde
with
red
and
white
complexion
and
hair
of
golden
tint
her
face
looked
in
its
delicacy
gleaming
out
from
the
somber
folds
of
her
mourning
dress
vance
sitting
opposite
absorbed
in
a
voluminous
billow
of
crimson
crochet
work
looked
over
at
her
and
started
as
if
she
had
only
just
begun
to
realize
the
girl
exceeding
fairness
how
pretty
she
is
she
thought
apprehensively
and
how
startling
her
likeness
to
her
dead
sister
good
heavens
what
if
lance
should
see
the
resemblance
as
plainly
as
i
do
and
fall
in
love
with
her
for
sake
the
thought
which
now
presented
itself
for
the
first
time
was
startling
in
its
probability
she
began
to
think
that
it
was
time
for
ada
to
be
going
back
to
school
it
was
dangerous
to
keep
that
fair
in
lancelot
darling
vicinity
ada
said
she
abruptly
how
old
are
you
sixteen
answered
the
girl
sleepily
without
lifting
her
drooping
lashes
almost
old
enough
to
come
out
in
society
said
the
lady
you
will
have
to
hurry
and
finish
your
education
you
mean
to
graduate
of
course
when
are
you
going
back
to
school
i
do
not
expect
to
go
back
at
all
was
the
startling
reply
not
go
back
said
vance
affecting
extreme
astonishment
papa
is
so
lonely
now
that
lily
is
gone
said
ada
choking
back
a
sob
that
i
have
not
the
heart
to
leave
him
i
will
stay
with
him
and
comfort
him
but
my
dear
you
so
young
so
unformed
in
your
manners
surely
you
will
not
sacrifice
yourself
thus
let
me
advise
you
to
go
back
to
college
another
year
at
least
urged
vance
a
little
annoyed
at
her
persistence
ada
sat
up
and
looked
across
at
her
vance
said
she
coldly
do
you
happen
to
know
that
if
i
took
your
advice
and
returned
to
my
this
house
could
no
longer
be
a
home
for
you
why
not
asked
the
lady
a
little
fluttered
do
you
not
see
said
ada
pointedly
you
are
not
related
to
papa
at
all
you
are
a
young
and
handsome
woman
if
you
and
he
were
living
here
alone
together
with
no
one
but
the
servants
people
would
couple
your
names
unpleasantly
so
you
comprehend
that
it
is
better
for
me
to
stay
and
play
propriety
ada
i
do
not
believe
you
care
whether
i
have
a
shelter
over
my
head
or
not
said
the
widow
stung
into
anger
by
the
pointed
speech
of
the
girl
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
any
one
houseless
answered
ada
calmly
but
to
own
the
truth
vance
i
must
say
that
i
am
sorry
that
the
same
roof
has
to
shelter
us
both
i
do
not
like
you
and
i
am
honest
enough
to
tell
you
so
because
i
am
poor
and
you
are
rich
said
vance
affecting
to
weep
it
is
not
that
said
the
young
girl
it
is
not
that
you
are
no
relation
to
papa
except
by
marriage
and
that
you
forced
yourself
here
and
claimed
a
support
when
you
might
have
earned
one
for
yourself
as
many
another
widow
has
done
no
it
is
not
for
these
things
vance
for
i
might
still
like
you
in
spite
of
them
though
i
might
pity
your
lack
of
true
independence
but
i
dislike
you
because
i
believe
you
are
a
false
deceitful
unprincipled
woman
scheming
for
some
secret
end
of
your
own
what
have
i
ever
done
to
you
ada
that
you
should
denounce
me
thus
sobbed
the
widow
nothing
you
would
not
dare
to
for
my
papa
would
turn
you
out
of
the
house
if
you
did
replied
the
girl
spiritedly
but
do
you
think
vance
i
can
not
see
your
present
drift
do
you
think
i
do
not
see
how
shamelessly
you
are
courting
lance
darling
and
trying
to
win
him
from
poor
lily
who
has
been
dead
these
four
months
scarcely
perhaps
you
want
him
for
yourself
vance
was
beginning
to
say
sarcastically
when
they
were
interrupted
by
a
slight
rap
on
the
door
enter
called
out
ada
it
was
a
servant
with
a
message
for
the
widow
there
an
old
woman
out
in
the
hall
vance
who
says
she
has
brought
the
samples
of
lace
you
desired
ada
who
was
watching
her
curiously
wondered
why
the
angry
woman
grew
so
ghastly
white
under
her
rouge
at
the
reception
of
so
commonplace
a
visitor
say
that
i
am
coming
said
the
widow
to
the
domestic
in
a
moment
she
arose
with
a
muttered
apology
and
followed
him
into
the
hall
old
haidee
stood
there
patiently
waiting
with
her
basket
of
laces
on
her
arm
bring
the
laces
up
to
my
apartment
said
the
lady
with
as
indifferent
an
air
as
she
could
assume
when
they
were
once
safe
within
the
locked
room
vance
turned
furiously
on
the
old
did
i
not
tell
you
not
to
come
here
again
she
said
i
have
nothing
else
to
give
you
oh
vance
do
say
that
whined
the
old
crone
piteously
i
did
not
mean
to
come
back
i
did
not
indeed
but
i
am
so
poor
and
the
gold
you
gave
me
is
all
gone
liar
there
was
enough
to
last
you
a
year
said
vance
angrily
oh
no
not
with
my
old
man
down
with
the
rheumatism
and
all
my
starving
children
around
me
the
money
all
went
for
medicine
food
and
clothes
it
melted
away
like
the
snow
whined
haidee
so
i
said
to
myself
i
will
go
back
i
will
tell
the
kind
lady
how
poor
i
am
and
she
will
give
me
more
money
i
told
you
i
had
no
more
to
give
almost
shrieked
vance
in
her
desperation
the
money
i
gave
you
was
presented
to
me
by
lawrence
and
he
expected
it
would
last
me
a
long
while
i
am
a
poor
woman
living
here
on
the
rich
man
bounty
and
i
have
nothing
more
for
you
absolutely
nothing
oh
but
the
pretty
lady
is
mistaken
said
haidee
doggedly
she
has
money
or
if
not
she
has
jewels
would
you
rob
me
of
my
few
jewels
you
base
old
wretch
necessity
knows
no
law
retorted
the
old
creature
grinning
hideously
i
must
have
help
for
my
sick
husband
and
starving
children
if
you
will
not
help
me
i
must
go
to
lawrence
or
to
mr
darling
these
sly
words
had
their
intended
effect
of
frightening
vance
into
compliance
she
went
to
her
jewel
box
and
began
hurriedly
to
toss
over
its
glittering
contents
here
she
said
turning
round
with
a
handsome
brooch
in
her
hand
will
this
satisfy
your
cupidity
but
old
haidee
eyes
roved
greedily
over
the
sparkling
gems
in
the
casket
she
shook
her
head
i
could
not
sell
it
for
a
quarter
of
its
value
said
she
it
would
not
relieve
my
necessities
add
some
other
trifle
to
it
lady
that
bracelet
for
instance
the
bracelet
was
a
very
handsome
one
in
the
form
of
a
serpent
with
glistening
emerald
eyes
with
a
groan
vance
put
it
into
the
greedy
working
fingers
you
will
strip
me
of
every
valuable
i
possess
she
said
and
then
when
i
have
nothing
else
to
give
you
will
betray
me
to
my
enemies
for
the
sake
of
gaining
a
reward
from
them
lady
you
do
me
cruel
injustice
was
the
hypocrite
meek
reply
i
will
never
betray
you
while
you
so
generously
divide
your
all
with
me
but
if
you
keep
coming
with
such
demands
as
this
i
shall
soon
have
nothing
to
divide
with
you
said
vance
aye
but
the
rich
man
will
soon
supply
you
with
more
gold
said
the
harpy
cunningly
as
she
turned
to
take
leave
it
will
be
a
good
while
before
i
get
any
more
money
from
lawrence
so
you
need
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
return
for
it
said
the
widow
letting
her
unwelcome
visitor
out
of
the
door
and
shaking
her
fist
after
her
departing
form
as
soon
as
her
heavy
footsteps
ceased
lumbering
on
the
stairs
she
hurriedly
changed
her
for
a
walking
costume
of
plain
material
and
simple
make
she
then
put
on
a
small
black
hat
tied
over
her
face
a
thick
dark
veil
and
descended
the
steps
letting
herself
quietly
out
at
the
front
door
once
in
the
street
she
paused
and
glanced
hurriedly
up
and
down
no
one
was
in
sight
but
the
crooked
form
of
the
old
going
slowly
along
a
few
blocks
ahead
of
her
vance
set
out
to
follow
the
old
woman
walking
briskly
a
few
squares
until
she
came
within
half
a
block
of
her
she
then
slackened
her
pace
and
went
on
more
slowly
keeping
herself
invisible
but
never
losing
sight
of
her
prey
i
will
track
the
beast
to
its
lair
she
said
to
herself
and
then
we
will
have
our
reckoning
out
vance
hurried
on
at
a
steady
pace
keeping
her
enemy
fairly
in
sight
but
aiming
to
keep
too
far
in
the
background
to
be
recognized
herself
she
had
a
long
walk
ahead
of
her
but
she
did
not
mind
it
for
her
excitement
was
so
great
that
she
was
insensible
to
bodily
fatigue
she
was
filled
with
a
raging
anger
against
ada
lawrence
whose
pure
true
instincts
had
so
clearly
fathomed
her
meanness
and
littleness
of
spirit
added
to
this
was
her
hatred
of
old
haidee
leveret
mixed
with
an
abject
fear
of
the
old
woman
power
against
her
in
the
possession
of
her
guilty
secret
as
she
turned
corner
after
corner
and
traversed
street
after
street
her
mind
was
busy
revolving
vague
schemes
by
which
to
rid
herself
of
the
greedy
and
dangerous
old
creature
who
began
to
hang
upon
her
shoulders
heavily
as
a
veritable
sinbad
at
length
she
began
to
see
that
she
was
coming
out
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
city
old
haidee
a
little
ahead
of
her
kept
on
at
a
swinging
pace
hastening
her
footsteps
as
she
found
herself
nearing
home
vance
kept
on
steadily
too
feeling
determined
to
find
out
the
old
home
if
she
had
any
at
last
they
reached
the
gloomy
old
stone
house
with
its
high
forbidding
stone
wall
even
vance
courageous
as
she
felt
herself
to
be
was
conscious
of
a
pang
resembling
fear
as
she
contemplated
the
place
but
when
haidee
was
entering
the
gate
she
felt
a
firm
touch
on
her
shoulder
and
turned
to
meet
the
smiling
gaze
of
the
beautiful
widow
you
see
i
have
overtaken
you
was
her
smooth
salutation
you
have
followed
me
exclaimed
haidee
with
a
savage
scowl
of
rage
and
surprise
commingled
yes
said
vance
coolly
woman
woman
are
you
not
afraid
cried
the
old
witch
pulling
her
visitor
in
and
letting
the
heavy
gate
fall
shut
between
them
and
the
outer
world
have
you
no
dread
of
my
vengeance
remember
a
word
from
me
can
consign
you
at
any
moment
to
the
prison
cell
yet
you
dare
to
incur
my
wrath
i
did
not
follow
you
to
provoke
you
to
anger
said
vance
deprecatingly
two
motives
prompted
me
to
discover
your
residence
first
i
desired
to
see
your
sick
husband
and
starving
children
in
the
hope
that
i
might
do
something
to
benefit
them
and
secondly
if
you
intend
to
make
periodical
calls
on
me
for
it
is
better
that
i
should
come
here
and
bring
it
than
for
you
to
call
on
me
your
frequent
visits
on
the
slight
pretext
of
your
laces
will
not
continue
to
deceive
anyone
and
may
draw
down
suspicion
upon
me
already
miss
lawrence
suspects
me
of
something
she
has
plainly
told
me
so
so
i
repeat
what
i
have
already
said
that
it
is
much
safer
for
me
to
come
here
than
for
you
to
go
there
come
in
then
do
said
haidee
with
a
grim
politeness
that
showed
she
was
not
much
imposed
on
by
the
lady
profuse
explanations
come
in
and
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
family
if
you
are
really
anxious
to
benefit
us
you
shall
have
the
opportunity
she
walked
on
down
the
patch
as
she
spoke
and
knocked
at
the
house
door
there
was
the
sound
of
a
key
grating
in
the
lock
then
the
door
swung
open
and
disclosed
old
peter
leveret
standing
on
the
threshold
vance
who
kept
close
behind
haidee
started
back
with
a
cry
of
fear
as
his
huge
misshapen
body
and
bristling
red
hair
met
her
gaze
that
is
my
old
man
said
the
lace
vender
coolly
i
see
you
do
not
like
his
looks
well
he
is
not
handsome
certainly
but
he
is
very
useful
in
ways
her
malicious
emphasis
on
the
last
words
sent
a
shudder
of
fear
through
the
veins
of
the
visitor
but
she
did
not
betray
her
alarm
she
followed
the
couple
quietly
into
their
rude
and
poorly
furnished
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
old
haidee
placed
for
her
old
peter
retired
from
their
company
at
an
almost
imperceptible
sign
from
his
wife
and
left
the
two
together
well
you
have
seen
my
husband
said
the
hostess
coolly
you
perceive
he
is
a
very
miserable
object
one
calculated
to
strike
fear
into
the
heart
of
a
fine
lady
with
such
delicate
nerves
as
your
own
my
children
i
am
sorry
to
say
are
not
at
home
they
would
have
remained
if
they
had
anticipated
the
honor
of
your
visit
but
they
are
all
out
begging
as
i
have
been
old
haidee
had
thrown
off
the
tone
of
whining
meekness
which
she
often
adopted
with
vance
and
showed
herself
now
cool
impudent
and
crafty
vance
noted
this
change
with
alarm
she
began
to
think
she
had
perhaps
erred
in
risking
her
head
in
the
lion
den
she
now
said
in
a
tone
of
meekness
calculated
to
allay
the
spirit
of
defiance
she
had
raised
in
the
old
witch
one
word
haidee
as
i
think
you
told
me
your
name
was
does
that
old
man
your
husband
share
the
secret
you
hold
against
me
i
told
you
once
was
the
answer
that
the
secret
belongs
to
me
alone
yes
but
as
a
man
and
his
wife
are
one
said
vance
cajolingly
perhaps
you
would
not
count
him
as
anyone
but
yourself
but
you
see
it
would
make
much
difference
to
me
so
i
ask
you
again
does
he
know
that
secret
and
i
decline
to
answer
that
question
answered
the
old
witch
craftily
truth
to
tell
old
peter
was
not
aware
of
the
secret
which
his
wife
assumed
to
hold
against
vance
for
haidee
in
her
miserly
avarice
had
wished
to
share
its
golden
fruits
alone
but
the
cunning
old
creature
saw
in
the
anxiety
of
the
lady
a
menace
of
danger
to
herself
and
thought
it
as
well
to
encourage
vance
doubts
in
that
direction
i
decline
to
answer
that
question
she
repeated
with
a
fearful
scowl
i
may
as
well
go
then
said
the
visitor
rising
she
was
too
much
frightened
at
the
loneliness
of
the
house
and
the
murderous
looks
of
its
inhabitants
to
remain
longer
but
haidee
i
wish
you
to
understand
plainly
that
you
are
not
to
enter
the
house
of
lawrence
again
if
you
must
have
more
from
me
you
can
send
me
a
line
through
the
and
i
will
come
here
myself
and
bring
you
what
i
can
raise
will
you
promise
to
do
this
i
will
promise
to
do
as
you
say
if
you
will
keep
your
word
was
the
sullen
answer
but
if
you
fail
to
come
with
the
money
within
hours
after
i
write
you
rest
assured
i
shall
come
after
it
at
the
grand
house
i
will
not
fail
you
was
the
firm
answer
and
now
unfasten
the
door
and
let
me
go
how
do
you
know
that
i
will
let
you
go
asked
haidee
tauntingly
this
is
a
fine
old
house
in
which
to
hold
you
prisoner
it
has
old
stone
dungeons
windows
vance
shuddered
but
she
answered
in
as
fearless
a
tone
as
possible
you
have
no
interest
in
making
a
prisoner
of
me
for
in
that
case
you
would
get
no
profit
out
of
your
secret
you
will
not
kill
the
goose
that
lays
the
golden
eggs
no
no
chuckled
haidee
but
perhaps
you
are
laying
some
plan
against
me
you
wish
to
have
me
arrested
it
is
not
likely
my
safety
depends
on
yours
no
no
you
need
fear
nothing
from
me
come
come
it
grows
late
i
am
very
thirsty
give
me
a
drink
of
water
and
let
me
go
the
water
was
procured
and
the
visitor
drank
and
departed
she
walked
hastily
over
the
lonely
road
passed
the
scattered
houses
and
then
hailing
an
empty
hack
that
was
passing
entered
it
and
was
driven
rapidly
homeward
her
thoughts
if
possible
being
more
gloomy
than
before
for
now
the
dread
of
old
peter
leveret
was
added
to
her
fears
of
his
wife
she
had
started
out
to
follow
old
haidee
with
black
murder
in
her
heart
she
had
not
believed
in
the
story
of
the
sick
husband
and
children
but
had
expected
to
find
the
old
crone
alone
heaven
knows
what
would
have
happened
if
she
had
but
instead
she
found
the
strong
hideous
old
man
whose
leering
looks
had
struck
terror
to
her
heart
and
she
now
believed
that
he
also
was
cognizant
of
the
fatal
secret
which
was
fraught
with
such
danger
to
her
her
thoughts
and
feelings
were
anything
but
enviable
ones
as
she
walked
up
the
steps
of
the
palace
she
called
her
home
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
she
saw
the
door
ajar
and
heard
voices
she
to
the
door
and
peeped
cautiously
in
lancelot
darling
was
there
his
handsome
head
bowed
over
the
couch
where
ada
half
reclined
listening
to
a
poem
which
lancelot
was
reading
aloud
they
looked
cozy
comfortable
and
supremely
contented
to
the
jealous
eyes
that
glared
steadily
upon
them
she
made
no
sign
however
but
went
on
to
her
room
with
a
tempest
in
her
heart
which
however
did
not
prevent
her
from
subsequently
descending
to
the
where
she
set
herself
to
work
by
every
beguiling
art
of
which
she
was
mistress
to
wile
away
the
unconscious
young
man
from
the
side
of
the
beautiful

haidee
leveret
had
scarcely
returned
from
locking
the
door
after
her
despairing
visitor
when
she
was
confronted
by
her
husband
old
peter
eyes
snapped
viciously
his
hideous
old
face
was
flushed
crimson
and
his
shock
of
bristly
red
hair
stood
erect
with
indignation
now
then
madam
said
he
with
a
snort
of
rage
i
have
caught
you
at
your
sly
tricks
have
i
what
is
the
matter
with
you
old
man
inquired
his
spouse
affecting
serene
unconsciousness
oh
you
may
well
ask
snapped
her
liege
lord
you
have
been
and
gone
and
discovered
a
mine
of
wealth
and
worked
it
yourself
in
secret
denying
your
poor
honest
old
husband
a
share
in
the
profits
oh
no
you
have
not
shut
up
your
nonsense
said
haidee
witheringly
you
have
got
a
secret
against
a
great
lady
pursued
old
peter
disregarding
her
adjuration
a
great
lady
who
follows
you
home
to
lavish
gold
upon
you
and
who
wants
to
know
if
poor
old
peter
shares
the
secret
with
you
that
she
may
bestow
some
of
her
wealth
upon
him
you
have
not
got
your
pockets
full
of
gold
at
this
moment
oh
no
no
no
you
have
been
eavesdropping
you
devil
cried
his
wife
in
a
rage
well
what
if
i
have
snapped
he
when
a
woman
has
secrets
from
her
husband
a
kind
faithful
old
man
like
you
have
got
haidee
it
is
his
right
to
find
out
all
he
can
by
hook
or
by
crook
i
have
a
mind
to
search
your
pockets
this
minute
and
see
what
hoards
of
wealth
you
have
hidden
there
now
have
done
with
your
foolishness
old
man
said
haidee
with
an
uneasy
consciousness
of
the
costly
golden
brooch
and
bracelet
lying
in
her
pocket
that
minute
will
you
turn
your
pocket
inside
out
then
and
let
me
see
if
it
is
empty
asked
her
husband
threateningly
no
i
wo
was
the
sullen
response
inflamed
with
rage
and
cupidity
the
old
man
advanced
fiercely
upon
her
intending
to
carry
out
his
threat
but
the
virago
was
ready
for
him
as
he
was
about
to
pinion
her
arms
down
to
prevent
her
resistance
she
suddenly
thrust
her
hands
into
his
hair
and
clutched
its
bushy
red
masses
tightly
in
her
long
and
fingers
this
done
with
a
quick
and
dexterous
movement
she
flourished
her
arms
and
brought
her
husband
down
groveling
on
his
knees
before
her
so
you
will
pick
my
pocket
will
you
you
old
villain
she
cried
triumphantly
but
she
cried
victory
a
moment
too
soon
as
she
spoke
the
words
old
peter
made
a
furious
lunge
forward
with
his
immense
head
and
succeeded
in
throwing
her
backward
upon
the
floor
where
she
lay
kicking
furiously
and
waving
her
hands
in
which
were
tangled
great
bunches
of
fiery
hair
the
old
man
immediately
followed
up
his
signal
success
by
planting
his
knees
on
her
chest
and
rifling
her
pocket
of
its
costly
contents
while
the
vanquished
wife
sent
forth
wailing
cries
of
rage
and
grief
at
the
spoliation
of
her
property
oh
yes
cried
the
old
man
holding
aloft
these
spoils
of
war
with
one
hand
while
he
vigorously
pummelled
his
wife
with
the
other
oh
yes
you
have
already
stripped
the
woman
of
her
money
and
have
now
commenced
on
her
jewels
where
have
you
hidden
the
pile
of
money
tell
me
this
minute
before
i
kill
you
receiving
no
answer
but
a
loud
curse
he
began
to
rain
blows
thick
and
fast
on
the
head
and
shoulders
of
his
powerless
victim
and
there
is
no
telling
how
this
conjugal
war
might
have
ended
had
not
a
loud
and
continued
knocking
on
the
door
startled
the
furious
belligerents
get
up
shrieked
the
vanquished
rejoicing
at
this
diversion
in
her
favor
get
up
and
open
the
door
someone
has
been
knocking
these
ten
minutes
past
old
peter
obeyed
this
mandate
reluctantly
shambling
off
and
carefully
pocketing
the
jewels
as
he
went
while
haidee
rose
and
straightened
her
disordered
dress
and
picked
up
her
cap
which
had
been
torn
off
in
the
furious
now
then
said
doctor
pratt
entering
attended
by
harold
colville
what
is
the
matter
here
i
never
heard
such
a
furious
racket
in
my
life
have
you
two
been
fighting
only
having
a
friendly
by
way
of
exercise
sir
answered
old
peter
with
a
hideous
grin
at
his
conquered
opponent
who
had
received
a
black
eye
and
a
swollen
face
for
her
portion
of
the
friendly
contest
while
he
himself
had
not
escaped
scatheless
as
he
bore
several
bloody
scratches
on
his
face
and
sundry
bites
on
his
large
red
hands
that
testified
to
the
efficacy
of
her
teeth
and
finger
nails
what
was
the
cause
of
your
quarrel
inquired
colville
curiously
it
was
of
no
moment
answered
haidee
with
a
warning
glance
at
her
old
man
but
peter
fighting
blood
was
up
and
he
did
not
heed
her
caution
he
proceeded
to
explain
by
way
of
revenge
on
his
angry
spouse
it
was
all
along
of
a
fine
lady
doctor
that
haidee
is
holding
a
secret
against
and
getting
lots
of
money
from
on
account
of
it
which
she
refuses
to
share
either
the
money
or
the
secret
with
her
poor
old
husband
who
is
the
lady
and
what
secret
have
you
got
against
her
inquired
doctor
pratt
looking
sternly
at
her
it
is
no
concern
of
yours
doctor
was
the
sullen
reply
her
name
was
vance
said
peter
taking
a
malicious
joy
in
circumventing
old
haidee
good
heavens
said
doctor
pratt
remembering
how
incautiously
he
had
talked
to
colville
about
the
widow
in
haidee
presence
why
you
is
it
possible
you
have
been
trading
upon
the
suspicions
you
heard
me
breathe
about
the
woman
the
old
witch
would
not
answer
but
peter
taking
on
himself
the
role
of
spokesman
replied
for
her
i
ca
tell
you
where
she
got
suspicions
or
her
information
sir
but
she
has
certainly
made
a
good
bit
by
her
knowledge
for
she
has
gathered
in
all
the
lady
money
and
now
begins
to
strip
her
of
her
jewels
fine
ladies
do
part
with
things
like
these
until
all
their
money
has
gone
the
same
gait
said
he
holding
up
the
brooch
and
the
jeweled
serpent
whose
emerald
eyes
glared
like
living
ones
it
a
lie
i
only
had
money
of
her
once
said
old
haidee
fiercely
she
is
a
poor
woman
and
has
nothing
to
pay
with
how
did
you
gain
your
information
peter
if
as
you
say
your
wife
would
not
share
her
secret
with
you
inquired
doctor
pratt
trembling
with
rage
against
haidee
the
lady
followed
her
home
to
make
arrangements
for
coming
here
the
next
time
to
pay
another
installment
of
haidee
had
been
going
there
on
some
pretext
of
peddling
lace
i
think
but
the
lady
was
afraid
to
have
her
come
to
her
house
again
and
promised
to
meet
her
here
my
god
said
the
physician
growing
white
with
fear
and
rage
vance
here
in
this
house
only
haidee
you
shall
repent
this
i
have
not
betrayed
any
of
your
secrets
doctor
i
was
only
making
a
little
money
for
myself
and
no
harm
done
said
the
old
witch
beginning
to
grow
apologetic
no
matter
you
must
never
go
there
again
nor
suffer
her
to
come
here
if
you
do
i
swear
i
will
murder
you
do
you
understand
me
yes
sir
was
the
sulky
answer
and
you
promise
to
do
as
i
bid
you
i
promise
very
well
then
see
that
you
keep
your
word
and
you
peter
let
me
know
if
she
dares
to
disobey
my
injunction
and
let
the
matter
rest
also
yourself
if
either
of
you
approach
vance
again
i
swear
you
shall
pay
a
heavy
penalty
for
your
temerity
your
prisoner
haidee
is
she
safe
inquired
harold
colville
growing
impatient
of
the
delay
she
is
sir
was
the
answer
the
key
then
we
wish
to
visit
her
said
colville
whereupon
he
and
doctor
pratt
both
arose
and
made
their
way
to
lily
room
chapter
xix
lily
lawrence
sat
alone
in
the
same
room
in
which
she
had
first
been
incarcerated
when
in
her
cataleptic
state
she
had
been
brought
to
this
house
of
captivity
peter
leveret
had
made
the
window
secure
again
and
she
had
been
removed
here
the
day
after
her
recapture
in
her
hall
by
colville
consequently
she
had
had
no
means
of
ascertaining
whether
or
not
the
miserable
wife
of
colville
still
survived
she
thought
it
more
than
likely
that
the
poor
creature
was
dead
and
beyond
all
suffering
which
the
vindictive
spirit
of
old
haidee
might
still
inflict
upon
her
while
a
spark
of
life
remained
in
her
body
a
profound
sympathy
and
regret
for
poor
fanny
wretched
fate
mixed
up
with
lily
deep
solicitude
for
herself
added
to
the
melancholy
air
which
began
to
overshadow
her
like
a
cloud
it
is
a
month
since
we
have
seen
her
and
she
has
changed
greatly
since
that
time
her
jailers
have
strictly
carried
out
colville
injunction
to
allow
her
nothing
but
bread
and
water
and
the
result
is
plainly
seen
in
an
added
frailty
of
face
and
form
as
she
sits
in
the
old
with
her
small
head
thrown
wearily
back
she
looks
almost
too
transparently
pale
and
pure
for
an
inhabitant
of
earth
the
blue
veins
show
plainly
as
they
wander
beneath
the
white
skin
the
blue
eyes
look
larger
and
darker
by
contrast
with
the
purple
shadows
beneath
them
the
once
rounded
cheeks
are
thin
and
hollow
even
the
lips
once
so
rosy
and
smiling
with
their
arch
dimpled
corners
have
taken
on
an
expression
of
pain
and
endurance
pitiful
to
see
in
one
so
young
and
fair
the
small
white
hands
growing
thin
and
weak
are
listlessly
folded
across
her
lap
while
she
looks
wearily
at
the
smouldering
ashes
of
a
fire
that
had
been
kindled
on
the
hearth
that
morning
for
the
september
mornings
are
chilly
and
the
girl
enfeebled
frame
feels
cold
keenly
thus
the
two
confederates
found
her
when
after
a
premonitory
rap
they
unlocked
the
door
and
entered
she
looked
up
and
her
white
face
blanched
still
whiter
at
their
presence
but
beyond
that
she
took
no
notice
save
in
a
fixed
and
slightly
scornful
curl
of
the
lip
i
trust
that
i
find
you
well
miss
lawrence
said
her
suitor
with
an
air
of
devotion
is
it
possible
i
should
feel
well
after
subsisting
for
a
month
on
bread
and
water
asked
the
girl
in
a
languid
voice
of
unutterable
contempt
lily
forgive
me
but
you
force
me
to
adopt
these
stringent
measures
it
is
my
love
that
drives
me
thus
to
extremes
in
hope
of
forcing
your
consent
at
last
oh
why
will
you
not
relent
and
make
yourself
comfortable
and
me
the
happiest
of
men
cried
colville
imploringly
as
he
tried
to
take
her
hand
in
his
own
but
she
drew
it
away
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
and
repugnance
to
his
touch
and
he
desisted
pratt
withdrew
to
the
window
and
appeared
to
ignore
the
conversation
lily
continued
colville
seeing
that
she
made
no
motion
of
replying
you
have
now
had
a
month
for
contemplation
and
sober
reflection
surely
you
have
profited
by
the
thoughts
that
must
have
assailed
you
in
that
time
do
you
now
consent
to
become
my
wife
colville
i
have
not
changed
my
mind
at
all
replied
lily
coldly
and
firmly
but
come
now
my
dear
girl
urged
colville
who
had
been
persuaded
by
pratt
to
try
a
little
kind
persuasion
instead
of
such
violent
threatenings
come
now
my
dear
girl
why
should
you
persist
in
your
first
rejection
of
my
suit
look
at
the
matter
calmly
and
dispassionately
and
weigh
all
the
advantages
in
my
favor
i
am
not
a
man
nor
an
old
man
i
have
a
splendid
income
and
i
love
you
to
distraction
i
would
spend
all
my
life
in
making
you
happy
this
is
your
one
chance
of
happiness
on
the
other
hand
there
is
nothing
but
captivity
and
starvation
were
it
not
better
to
become
my
wife
no
answered
lily
firmly
you
are
very
candid
at
least
if
not
very
flattering
said
colville
bitterly
lily
regarded
him
sadly
and
calmly
she
could
pity
him
when
he
showed
some
sign
of
feeling
she
only
hated
and
feared
him
when
he
descended
to
abuse
and
threatening
colville
said
she
in
her
soft
voice
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
if
you
love
me
as
you
say
you
do
i
pity
you
from
my
heart
but
if
i
yielded
to
your
wish
and
became
your
wife
i
could
bring
you
no
happiness
i
do
not
love
you
and
i
should
hate
you
then
for
the
means
you
used
to
win
me
oh
believe
me
your
persistence
is
unwise
and
foolish
let
me
go
away
from
here
i
beg
you
to
my
home
and
my
friends
i
will
not
betray
your
complicity
in
my
abduction
i
will
suffer
you
and
your
friend
there
to
invent
whatever
plausible
tale
you
please
and
i
will
try
to
palm
it
off
on
my
friends
for
the
truth
see
i
bear
you
no
malice
for
the
cruelty
and
injustice
i
have
suffered
at
your
hands
i
am
willing
to
forgive
you
everything
if
you
will
but
restore
my
freedom
you
waste
your
breath
in
such
appeals
lily
i
will
never
let
you
go
said
colville
inflexibly
oh
i
beseech
you
do
not
kill
me
with
such
refusals
cried
lily
wildly
she
slipped
from
her
chair
and
knelt
before
him
clasping
her
fragile
white
hands
in
an
agony
of
appeal
and
lifting
her
wan
white
face
imploringly
see
i
kneel
to
you
my
spirit
is
broken
my
pride
is
humbled
in
the
dust
i
am
starving
dying
here
i
beg
you
for
the
poor
boon
of
my
liberty
and
life
he
stood
still
with
folded
arms
regarding
her
as
she
knelt
while
a
cold
and
cruel
smile
curled
the
corners
of
his
thin
lips
her
pitiful
appeal
made
no
impression
on
him
he
was
not
moved
by
the
sight
of
her
fragile
face
and
hands
wasted
into
pallor
and
wanness
through
his
cruelty
his
answer
fell
on
her
quivering
nerves
as
cruelly
as
the
lash
cuts
into
human
flesh
kneel
if
it
relieves
your
feelings
but
do
not
suppose
that
your
humility
can
weaken
my
resolution
which
is
as
fixed
as
adamant
and
hear
me
now
proud
girl
and
remember
that
i
mean
what
i
say
i
shall
yet
give
you
time
to
change
your
mind
i
am
merciful
to
you
because
i
love
you
but
if
time
does
not
weaken
your
perversity
so
surely
as
i
live
i
will
make
you
repent
your
obstinacy
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
kneel
to
me
more
prayerfully
than
you
now
do
and
implore
me
to
marry
you
and
save
your
honor
never
she
cried
springing
to
her
feet
and
waving
her
white
hands
aloft
like
some
beautiful
inspired
prophetess
never
before
that
day
comes
i
will
die
by
my
own
hand
and
harold
colville
while
you
exult
in
your
wickedness
remember
that
there
is
a
god
above
who
punishes
the
guilty
for
their
evil
deeds
nemesis
shall
yet
overtake
you
it
is
written
come
come
miss
lawrence
you
overrate
your
strength
by
this
senseless
ranting
said
doctor
pratt
coming
forward
and
reseating
her
with
gentle
force
remember
you
are
very
weak
you
have
never
fully
recovered
from
the
effects
of
your
wound
and
your
subsequent
fast
during
the
cataleptic
state
that
succeeded
it
illness
and
deprivation
have
sapped
your
strength
and
dimmed
your
beauty
until
there
will
soon
be
nothing
left
of
the
fairness
that
now
holds
colville
heart
believe
me
your
wisest
course
is
to
yield
now
marry
colville
and
set
about
the
restoration
of
your
health
by
travel
recreation
and
generous
living
a
few
more
months
of
this
reckless
obstinacy
will
break
down
your
constitution
irrevocably
i
thank
you
for
that
assurance
she
answered
exultingly
perhaps
death
will
come
to
me
of
his
own
accord
and
save
me
from
the
sin
of
taking
my
own
life
and
sending
my
soul
trembling
and
uncalled
before
its
dread
creator
you
do
not
mean
what
you
say
miss
lawrence
you
are
too
young
and
lovely
to
welcome
death
life
holds
many
attractions
for
you
even
as
the
wife
of
the
despised
mr
colville
i
do
not
think
so
she
answered
briefly
well
well
your
mind
will
change
perhaps
and
in
that
laudable
desire
we
will
take
leave
of
you
for
awhile
said
the
doctor
turning
off
with
a
sardonic
bow
and
do
me
the
favor
of
never
returning
said
lily
angrily
you
can
never
change
my
decision
and
if
i
am
doomed
to
wear
out
the
remnant
of
my
days
here
let
me
at
least
be
spared
the
sight
of
your
hated
faces
again
you
ask
too
much
said
colville
airily
captives
are
not
permitted
to
make
their
own
conditions
or
select
their
visitors
adieu
obdurate
fair
one
his
gaze
lingered
on
her
a
moment
noting
her
beauty
and
grace
which
still
shone
though
her
beautiful
coloring
was
all
faded
and
gone
and
she
looked
like
a
picture
looked
at
by
moonlight
alone
with
all
the
bright
tints
of
daylight
invisible
loving
her
for
her
beauty
and
hating
her
for
her
scorn
he
went
away
but
carried
the
picture
in
his
heart
at
once
a
joy
and
a
torment
for
his
conscience
could
not
but
reproach
him
for
the
change
that
was
so
sadly
visible
in
her
fragile
drooping
form
lily
remained
sitting
motionless
in
her
chair
lost
in
painful
revery
until
twilight
filled
the
room
with
shadows
the
room
grew
chilly
and
she
shivered
now
and
then
in
her
thin
dress
but
she
never
stirred
until
old
haidee
entered
with
a
light
and
supper
the
latter
consisting
of
a
scanty
portion
of
dry
bread
and
a
pitcher
of
water
lily
cast
a
glance
of
loathing
upon
the
food
and
turned
away
her
weak
appetite
could
not
relish
the
dry
bread
and
it
often
was
taken
away
untasted
haidee
i
wish
you
would
light
a
fire
said
she
shivering
in
the
chilly
atmosphere
the
night
is
cool
and
i
am
very
thinly
clad
there
will
be
no
fire
said
haidee
curtly
if
you
are
cold
go
to
bed
and
cover
up
under
the
at
least
bring
me
a
shawl
to
wrap
about
my
shoulders
pleaded
the
girl
not
a
rag
retorted
the
old
woman
whose
sharp
temper
was
even
more
acid
than
usual
on
account
of
her
rencontre
that
evening
does
colville
wish
me
to
suffer
from
cold
as
well
as
hunger
inquired
lily
bitterly
i
wish
it
whether
he
does
or
not
answered
haidee
viciously
what
noise
was
that
i
heard
this
evening
inquired
lily
looking
curiously
at
the
old
woman
i
was
very
much
frightened
by
a
succession
of
screams
and
oaths
as
if
people
were
fighting
ah
and
now
that
i
look
at
you
haidee
i
see
that
there
is
something
the
matter
with
your
face
old
peter
whipped
me
if
you
must
know
the
truth
snapped
the
witch
whipped
you
said
lily
with
an
incredulous
look
oh
no
he
would
not
whip
his
wife
would
he
yes
he
would
and
did
retorted
haidee
with
a
grim
sort
of
smile
as
if
she
took
a
certain
sort
of
pride
in
peter
ferocity
oh
we
think
nothing
of
a
fight
now
and
then
sometimes
i
get
the
better
of
him
sometimes
he
overpowers
me
but
it
often
an
even
thing
old
peter
is
a
ferocious
one
i
can
tell
you
if
you
had
knocked
him
down
as
you
did
me
the
time
you
escaped
he
would
have
killed
you
when
they
brought
you
back
lily
shuddered
at
this
intimation
of
peter
cruelty
haidee
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
you
that
day
said
she
earnestly
i
would
not
hurt
the
meanest
thing
that
lives
if
i
could
help
it
i
only
pushed
you
to
throw
you
off
your
balance
so
that
i
might
get
away
you
had
better
eat
your
supper
said
haidee
not
caring
to
recall
that
day
for
she
still
harbored
a
furious
resentment
against
the
girl
on
the
score
of
it
and
often
felt
tempted
to
wreak
revenge
upon
her
you
had
better
eat
your
supper
for
old
peter
will
be
angry
with
you
if
you
keep
him
waiting
outside
the
door
so
long
take
the
bread
away
i
can
not
eat
any
answered
lily
with
a
hopeless
sigh
chapter
xx
the
autumn
sunlight
fell
goldenly
on
the
handsome
face
and
form
of
lancelot
darling
as
he
stood
on
the
broad
marble
steps
of
the
grand
hotel
where
he
boarded
his
glance
roving
carelessly
up
and
down
the
crowded
street
our
hero
was
that
whose
species
is
almost
extinct
at
the
present
day
a
young
man
of
wealth
and
fashion
yet
totally
unspoiled
by
the
flattery
and
adulation
of
the
world
carefully
raised
by
judicious
parents
whom
he
had
unhappily
lost
by
death
in
the
dawn
of
manhood
he
had
been
shielded
from
many
temptations
that
would
have
assailed
one
less
carefully
guarded
than
this
only
and
beloved
child
of
fond
and
doting
parental
care
enjoying
the
possession
of
an
almost
princely
fortune
which
precluded
the
need
of
work
one
would
have
thought
him
liable
to
be
whirled
into
the
maelstrom
of
vice
and
dissipation
and
engulfed
in
its
fatal
whirlpool
forever
but
such
was
not
the
case
he
was
only
when
he
met
and
loved
the
beautiful
lily
lawrence
and
her
love
had
been
to
him
a
talisman
and
safeguard
against
evil
even
now
amid
the
total
wreck
of
all
his
hopes
and
the
despair
that
filled
his
own
being
he
was
no
less
the
man
and
perfect
gentleman
than
when
the
happiness
of
lily
love
had
crowned
his
life
with
bliss
as
he
stood
there
on
the
marble
steps
he
did
not
note
the
many
admiring
glances
that
fell
on
him
from
the
appreciative
looks
of
women
whose
gaze
lingered
on
the
tall
elegant
figure
and
handsome
face
nor
the
approving
nod
of
men
who
while
they
made
no
endeavor
to
reach
his
lofty
standard
could
yet
admire
him
as
a
gentleman
peur
et
sans
while
he
stood
thus
abstracted
a
boy
approached
and
placing
in
his
hand
a
delicate
envelope
scented
with
heliotrope
turned
away
lancelot
turned
the
envelope
in
his
hand
for
a
moment
in
some
surprise
for
the
writing
was
unfamiliar
in
a
moment
he
tore
it
open
however
and
read
these
few
lines
on
the
perfumed
sheet
my
dear
friend
i
enclose
a
list
of
some
new
songs
which
i
wish
to
try
will
you
do
me
the
favor
to
select
them
for
me
and
bring
them
up
this
afternoon
yours
faithfully
ethel
vance
this
was
a
bold
move
on
the
part
of
the
fascinating
widow
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
could
have
sent
the
boy
to
a
music
store
and
secured
the
songs
at
less
trouble
than
by
entrusting
the
commission
to
lancelot
darling
the
young
man
was
aware
of
the
fact
also
but
in
the
integrity
of
his
own
heart
he
suspected
no
art
in
her
and
made
an
excuse
for
her
in
his
mind
how
she
is
he
thought
she
knows
how
wretched
and
forlorn
i
am
and
charitably
devises
schemes
for
drawing
me
away
from
my
gloomy
retrospections
and
cheering
me
with
her
gentle
society
thus
thinking
lancelot
turned
away
and
proceeded
to
execute
the
commission
and
punctually
he
appeared
at
lawrence
that
afternoon
the
artful
woman
was
alone
and
rose
to
greet
him
with
a
beaming
smile
of
welcome
she
had
laid
aside
her
usual
dress
of
half
mourning
and
appeared
in
a
becoming
costume
of
costly
black
velvet
and
brocade
profusely
trimmed
with
rich
lace
diamonds
twinkled
in
her
ears
and
on
her
breast
and
a
bunch
of
vivid
scarlet
roses
was
fastened
in
the
jetty
braids
of
her
beautiful
hair
it
is
kind
of
you
to
come
she
said
pressing
his
hand
in
her
soft
pink
palm
as
he
bowed
before
her
ada
has
gone
riding
with
her
father
and
i
am
very
lonely
it
is
not
much
kindness
on
my
part
said
he
bluntly
for
i
am
aware
that
i
am
not
very
cheerful
company
for
anyone
these
days
i
only
came
because
you
asked
me
and
not
at
all
that
you
wished
to
see
me
said
she
with
a
very
becoming
pout
of
her
rich
red
lip
oh
pardon
my
rudeness
said
lance
contritely
you
know
i
did
not
mean
that
of
course
i
like
to
see
you
you
are
very
kind
to
me
always
i
meant
that
i
would
not
presume
to
inflict
my
sad
countenance
and
heavy
heart
upon
you
unless
you
insisted
i
should
do
so
you
are
very
sad
certainly
answered
she
with
a
pensive
air
indeed
i
sometimes
wonder
lance
that
the
natural
of
youth
does
not
begin
to
assert
itself
within
you
it
is
almost
five
months
since
your
bereavement
and
we
do
not
grieve
forever
for
the
dead
do
we
not
he
asked
with
a
heavy
sigh
ah
vance
my
grief
does
not
lessen
with
time
my
love
was
deeper
than
a
common
love
and
my
regret
will
be
eternal
that
is
all
romantic
nonsense
she
answered
impatiently
it
is
not
the
nature
of
any
human
creature
to
cherish
the
memory
of
one
dead
forever
hearts
crave
tangible
close
tenderness
love
presence
warm
and
near
you
will
be
happy
again
lance
and
you
will
love
again
you
judge
me
wrongly
vance
and
the
constancy
of
a
heart
like
mine
you
used
a
quotation
just
now
permit
me
to
reply
with
another
one
in
a
voice
like
saddest
music
he
repeated
those
exquisite
lines
from
leigh
hunt
the
world
buds
every
year
but
the
heart
just
once
and
when
the
blossom
falls
off
sere
no
new
blossom
comes
again
ah
the
rose
goes
with
the
wind
but
the
thorns
remain
behind
your
poetry
reminds
me
of
the
new
songs
said
she
dropping
the
argument
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
bring
them
will
you
come
to
the
piano
and
turn
the
leaves
while
i
try
them
certainly
he
answered
rising
and
attending
her
it
was
the
hardest
thing
she
could
have
asked
of
him
but
lance
was
very
unselfish
he
put
down
the
throb
of
pain
that
rose
at
the
remembrance
of
the
new
songs
he
and
lily
had
been
wont
to
practice
at
the
same
piano
and
turned
the
leaves
with
a
steady
hand
while
her
fingers
flew
over
the
keys
but
one
thing
she
had
asked
more
than
once
it
was
that
he
should
sing
with
her
this
he
always
quietly
declined
to
do
that
is
rude
of
you
she
would
say
in
a
voice
of
chagrin
your
tenor
is
so
perfectly
splendid
why
should
you
refuse
i
shall
never
sing
again
he
would
answer
quietly
but
firmly
and
no
persuasion
on
her
part
could
induce
him
to
change
his
mind
it
was
agony
for
him
to
stand
there
and
turn
the
leaves
looking
down
upon
that
dark
head
instead
of
the
golden
one
he
had
been
wont
to
gaze
upon
so
fondly
when
the
face
was
lifted
with
a
smile
to
his
and
instead
of
lily
soft
blue
eyes
he
met
the
gaze
of
the
black
ones
his
heart
thrilled
with
pain
perhaps
she
guessed
it
but
she
kept
him
there
all
the
same
thinking
that
time
would
blunt
the
keenness
of
his
remembrance
and
teach
him
to
adore
the
brunette
as
fondly
as
he
had
loved
the
blonde
she
played
at
him
she
sung
at
him
lifting
her
passionate
glance
to
his
whenever
some
appropriate
sentiment
in
the
song
seemed
to
warrant
such
expressiveness
lance
never
dreamed
of
the
reason
for
her
pantomime
he
had
seen
the
same
thing
practiced
by
ladies
in
society
he
deemed
it
a
harmless
kind
of
flirting
but
never
thought
of
responding
to
it
she
kept
him
there
perhaps
an
hour
patiently
waiting
on
her
pleasure
and
passing
his
opinion
only
as
it
was
called
for
on
the
various
pieces
she
was
practicing
at
last
to
his
great
relief
she
grew
weary
of
her
amusement
and
left
the
piano
come
and
read
to
me
lance
said
she
with
a
pretty
tone
of
proprietorship
in
him
i
am
tired
of
the
music
i
do
not
like
the
songs
there
is
not
a
passable
one
in
the
whole
selection
she
threw
herself
down
on
a
rich
divan
and
settled
herself
to
listen
lance
selected
a
volume
of
tennyson
and
seating
himself
near
her
began
to
read
quite
at
random
the
celebrated
poem
of
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
of
me
you
shall
not
win
renown
you
thought
to
break
a
country
heart
for
pastime
ere
you
went
to
town
at
me
you
smiled
but
unbeguiled
i
saw
the
snare
and
i
retired
the
daughter
of
a
hundred
earls
you
are
not
one
to
be
desired
oh
no
more
of
that
she
cried
as
he
paused
after
the
first
verse
i
have
never
fancied
that
poem
try
something
else
patiently
he
turned
the
leaves
and
came
upon
the
exquisite
little
poem
of
edward
gray
a
dainty
bit
of
versification
admired
by
all
women
this
will
please
her
fancy
he
thought
and
began
again
sweet
emma
moreland
of
yonder
town
met
me
walking
on
yonder
way
have
you
lost
your
heart
she
said
are
you
married
yet
edward
gray
sweet
emma
moreland
spoke
to
me
bitterly
weeping
i
turned
away
emma
moreland
love
no
more
can
touch
the
heart
of
edward
gray
you
need
not
finish
that
one
said
she
impatiently
pray
excuse
me
lance
but
i
do
not
think
you
make
very
pretty
selections
or
perhaps
i
am
not
in
the
humor
for
listening
put
the
book
aside
let
us
talk
instead
as
you
will
fair
lady
said
he
gallantly
i
shall
listen
to
you
with
pleasure
but
i
must
warn
you
that
my
conversational
powers
are
not
great
perhaps
the
will
is
wanting
said
she
trying
hard
to
repress
all
signs
of
vexation
it
was
terribly
hard
to
lead
him
on
this
young
ideal
of
hers
oh
no
said
he
smiling
slightly
it
is
a
real
inability
for
which
i
ought
to
be
excusable
and
so
you
are
excusable
said
she
with
a
tender
glance
there
are
but
few
things
i
would
not
excuse
in
you
lance
you
are
very
good
to
say
so
he
answered
quite
gravely
i
am
very
faulty
i
know
and
it
needs
the
eyes
of
a
true
friend
indeed
to
overlook
my
manifold
imperfections
a
true
friend
she
sighed
softly
ah
would
that
i
might
find
such
an
one
lance
was
about
to
make
some
commonplace
reply
to
this
aspiration
when
he
suddenly
observed
that
her
face
had
dropped
into
her
hands
and
she
was
crying
softly
her
graceful
form
heaving
with
deep
emotion
vance
said
he
in
alarm
what
is
the
cause
of
your
distress
have
i
said
or
done
anything
to
wound
you
if
i
have
pray
forgive
me
it
was
unintentional
i
assure
you
there
was
no
reply
she
continued
to
sob
violently
for
a
few
minutes
while
lancelot
sat
silent
and
perplexed
at
her
unusual
emotion
at
length
the
storm
of
grief
ceased
in
low
sighs
and
she
lifted
her
head
and
carefully
wiped
off
a
few
genuine
tears
that
hung
pendent
on
her
silky
lashes
and
threatened
to
fall
upon
her
cheek
and
wash
off
the
delicate
so
carefully
put
on
lance
at
once
renewed
his
apologies
and
regrets
it
is
i
who
should
beg
your
pardon
lance
for
this
childish
and
undignified
outburst
of
mine
said
she
with
quivering
lips
but
indeed
i
could
not
help
it
our
chance
words
struck
a
chord
so
tender
that
it
vibrated
painfully
oh
lance
i
am
very
unhappy
i
should
not
have
thought
it
said
he
quite
surprised
at
her
admission
no
because
i
mask
my
aching
heart
in
deceitful
smiles
was
the
mournful
answer
but
you
have
no
present
cause
for
unhappiness
said
lancelot
quite
perplexed
as
to
the
means
of
comforting
her
your
home
is
pleasant
your
friends
are
kind
and
loving
ah
you
think
so
said
she
with
a
bitter
smile
but
you
do
not
know
what
i
have
to
endure
you
could
scarcely
believe
how
bitterly
ada
lawrence
taunts
me
with
my
poverty
and
dependence
were
it
not
for
lawrence
whom
i
will
admit
is
kind
in
his
way
i
believe
she
would
drive
me
forth
homeless
and
shelterless
surely
you
misjudge
ada
said
he
warmly
i
am
sure
she
has
a
tender
heart
ah
her
sweet
face
is
no
index
of
her
mind
answered
vance
with
a
gloomy
shake
of
her
head
god
knows
what
insolence
i
daily
endure
from
that
girl
ah
lance
this
life
of
dependence
is
a
bitter
one
i
would
leave
here
and
seek
to
earn
my
own
bread
with
my
own
weak
hands
were
it
not
for
one
dear
tie
which
holds
me
with
a
power
stronger
than
my
woman
will
and
that
tie
asked
the
unconscious
young
man
in
a
voice
of
gentle
interest
is
my
passionate
uncontrollable
hopeless
love
for
one
whom
i
will
not
name
she
answered
in
a
broken
voice
and
drooping
her
eyes
from
his
earnest
gaze
you
mean
mr
lawrence
lance
queried
in
surprise
can
you
think
so
inquired
the
lady
in
a
low
and
meaning
tone
lifting
her
eyes
with
one
swift
glance
to
his
face
then
quickly
letting
them
droop
again
beneath
their
sweeping
lashes
it
seems
incredible
pursued
lancelot
quite
oblivious
of
the
meaning
she
had
so
delicately
conveyed
lawrence
though
a
very
fine
looking
man
is
at
least
double
your
age
and
is
not
at
all
the
kind
of
a
man
i
should
have
supposed
as
likely
to
win
your
love
mrs
vance
heavens
what
obtuseness
thought
the
almost
distracted
woman
he
not
understand
i
shall
have
to
tell
him
plainly
and
then
see
what
will
become
of
his
sublime
unconsciousness
oh
lance
she
cried
shading
her
burning
cheek
with
her
hand
why
will
you
misunderstand
my
meaning
i
did
not
mean
to
tell
you
the
truth
but
your
assumption
of
my
love
for
that
old
dotard
forces
me
to
vindicate
the
choice
of
my
heart
oh
lance
do
you
not
know
can
you
not
see
what
i
am
ashamed
to
put
in
these
plain
words
that
it
is
whom
i
love
and
no
other
if
a
bombshell
had
exploded
at
lancelot
darling
feet
he
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
and
actually
alarmed
than
he
was
at
this
avowal
of
love
from
the
woman
whom
he
had
honestly
admired
and
reverenced
as
one
among
the
gentlest
and
loveliest
of
her
sex
he
sprang
up
and
stood
looking
down
at
her
while
a
blush
of
honest
shame
for
her
burnt
on
his
cheek
oh
no
he
stammered
finding
breath
after
a
long
embarrassed
pause
you
can
not
mean
what
you
say
she
arose
at
his
words
and
drawing
near
him
laid
a
fluttering
hand
on
his
her
dark
eyes
still
drooped
before
his
and
her
shamed
yet
imploring
posture
was
the
embodiment
of
grace
do
not
be
angry
she
pleaded
i
do
mean
it
how
could
i
help
it
when
you
are
the
only
living
creature
that
is
kind
to
me
oh
forgive
me
lance
for
my
wild
words
and
let
me
love
you
a
little
vance
it
is
a
shame
for
a
woman
to
love
unsought
said
he
in
a
low
rebuking
tone
oh
do
not
say
so
she
answered
wildly
you
men
are
too
hard
upon
us
women
you
tie
us
down
and
restrict
us
in
everything
and
if
we
let
our
poor
clinging
hearts
go
out
to
you
ever
so
little
before
you
give
us
leave
then
you
cry
out
shame
upon
us
oh
lance
is
it
so
strange
that
i
should
love
you
you
have
been
kind
to
me
you
are
dangerously
handsome
and
winning
and
a
woman
heart
must
cling
to
something
i
have
not
a
true
friend
on
earth
lance
i
have
no
one
to
love
and
no
one
to
love
me
i
am
lonely
and
wretched
beyond
expression
let
me
love
you
and
say
that
you
will
love
me
in
return
her
forlornness
moved
his
generous
heart
to
pity
and
sorrow
for
her
he
stood
still
as
if
rooted
to
the
spot
listening
to
the
wild
torrent
of
words
she
poured
forth
so
eagerly
why
should
you
be
angry
because
a
woman
heart
lies
at
your
feet
lance
to
trample
on
or
to
cherish
as
you
please
am
i
not
young
beautiful
accomplished
if
you
chose
me
for
your
own
before
the
world
what
could
any
one
say
against
me
save
that
i
could
bring
you
no
wealth
but
myself
still
no
word
from
the
appalled
listener
she
raised
her
eyes
beseechingly
to
him
and
drew
a
step
nearer
lance
do
speak
to
me
do
tell
me
that
i
am
not
wasting
the
wealth
of
my
woman
heart
in
vain
he
gently
removed
her
clinging
hands
and
seated
her
in
a
low
standing
beside
her
and
looking
down
with
visible
embarrassment
yet
with
a
steady
purpose
vance
he
said
gently
words
would
fail
me
if
i
tried
to
express
the
unutterable
regret
i
feel
for
the
revelation
you
have
made
you
must
know
how
hopeless
your
affection
is
remembering
all
that
i
have
said
on
that
subject
this
afternoon
there
is
no
woman
living
no
matter
what
her
attractions
may
be
who
could
take
the
place
of
lily
lawrence
in
my
heart
but
she
did
not
love
you
she
died
by
her
own
hand
rather
than
wed
you
perhaps
so
we
can
not
tell
be
that
as
it
may
i
shall
keep
her
image
in
my
heart
forever
and
no
other
woman
shall
come
between
us
earnestly
answered
lily
loyal
lover
then
there
is
no
hope
for
me
she
moaned
faintly
none
vance
absolutely
none
pardon
me
that
i
have
been
forced
to
wound
you
thus
and
forget
this
madness
if
you
can
no
one
shall
ever
know
of
it
from
me
said
he
gently
as
he
turned
to
go
are
you
going
she
asked
rising
yes
he
asked
pausing
reluctantly
one
word
lance
i
have
been
mad
and
blind
in
allowing
my
feelings
to
find
vent
as
i
have
done
i
beg
your
pardon
and
ask
you
as
a
priceless
boon
to
forgive
and
forget
my
madness
will
you
try
and
do
it
gladly
he
answered
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
one
thing
more
you
will
not
suffer
this
act
of
mine
to
alter
your
pleasant
relations
with
the
household
here
you
will
come
and
go
as
usual
that
they
may
not
suspect
anything
has
occurred
i
promise
you
that
i
will
not
obtrude
my
company
upon
you
said
she
humbly
it
were
better
that
i
should
remain
away
he
said
hesitatingly
but
you
will
come
sometimes
she
said
and
he
did
not
answer
nay
but
only
said
chapter
xxi
shelton
the
famous
detective
was
slowly
but
surely
gaining
ground
in
his
mysterious
and
interesting
case
for
a
long
time
it
had
puzzled
him
and
baffled
his
investigations
but
having
at
last
obtained
a
single
clew
he
began
to
push
on
slowly
to
be
sure
but
certainly
to
eventual
success
he
had
discovered
after
patient
and
almost
incredible
labors
that
doctor
pratt
was
the
man
who
had
bribed
the
sexton
and
obtained
the
key
of
the
lawrence
vault
the
night
of
lily
interment
there
he
had
also
learned
that
harold
colville
wore
the
missing
half
of
the
broken
locket
found
in
lawrence
hall
the
night
on
which
the
specter
of
the
banker
daughter
had
appeared
to
the
assembled
family
as
yet
he
had
not
thought
of
linking
these
separate
facts
together
but
the
day
was
not
far
away
when
he
would
do
so
he
adopted
quite
a
bold
method
of
obtaining
the
desired
knowledge
regarding
colville
he
called
upon
that
gentleman
attired
in
a
very
plain
business
suit
and
still
further
disguised
by
a
rather
long
wig
of
reddish
hair
set
off
by
beard
and
eyebrows
of
the
same
ruddy
hue
he
sent
up
a
card
to
the
gentleman
of
pleasure
simply
engraved
j
styles
after
some
delay
he
was
ushered
into
colville
parlor
that
gentleman
attired
in
the
extreme
of
fashion
merely
nodded
at
his
visitor
entrance
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
rise
for
such
a
personage
i
have
not
the
honor
of
knowing
you
sir
said
he
stiffly
styles
to
the
bankers
lawrence
and
explained
the
visitor
briskly
indeed
said
colville
affecting
nonchalance
but
he
started
violently
and
the
keen
eyes
of
styles
saw
that
he
turned
a
trifle
paler
you
have
met
with
a
loss
i
see
said
the
under
clerk
abruptly
bending
forward
and
taking
hold
of
the
broken
locket
that
dangled
among
the
charms
of
the
gentleman
a
personal
affair
that
does
not
concern
strangers
answered
colville
haughtily
as
he
drew
back
i
beg
your
pardon
it
is
the
very
business
on
which
i
called
replied
the
visitor
imperturbably
as
he
spoke
he
slipped
his
fingers
into
his
breast
pocket
produced
the
missing
half
of
the
locket
and
deftly
fitted
it
to
the
broken
part
that
dangled
from
the
chain
i
have
the
honor
to
return
this
to
you
sir
said
he
slipping
the
jewel
into
colville
hand
the
gentleman
fingers
closed
over
it
mechanically
why
what
the
devil
where
did
you
find
it
asked
he
thrown
off
his
guard
by
the
unconcerned
and
business
air
of
the
i
did
not
find
it
at
all
answered
styles
calmly
i
was
commissioned
to
return
it
to
you
by
lawrence
it
was
found
in
the
hallway
of
his
residence
on
the
evening
of
the
instant
colville
started
as
if
a
bullet
had
struck
him
he
grew
deathly
white
even
to
the
lips
and
stared
at
the
visitor
a
moment
in
silence
at
length
he
recovered
himself
with
a
powerful
effort
and
asked
curtly
well
why
did
lawrence
think
of
sending
it
to
me
i
did
not
lose
it
there
lawrence
is
a
friend
of
mine
certainly
but
i
have
not
called
on
him
for
several
months
he
recognized
it
as
your
property
and
supposed
that
you
might
have
called
on
the
ladies
that
day
in
his
absence
returned
the
visitor
fabricating
this
lie
with
effrontery
yes
that
seemed
plausible
answered
colville
with
evident
relief
i
suppose
now
that
you
have
no
idea
where
you
actually
lost
it
inquired
the
clerk
respectfully
not
the
slightest
indeed
it
was
but
yesterday
that
i
discovered
the
loss
that
must
have
been
several
days
afterwards
if
as
you
said
it
was
found
on
the
replied
colville
more
affably
than
he
had
yet
spoken
you
will
return
my
thanks
to
lawrence
for
its
prompt
return
it
appears
strange
that
it
should
be
found
in
the
hallway
of
a
house
which
you
have
not
entered
for
months
does
it
not
sir
remarked
the
clerk
with
a
musing
air
exceedingly
strange
returned
colville
uneasily
but
perhaps
it
had
been
found
on
the
street
by
some
person
who
might
have
lost
it
in
lawrence
hall
that
day
that
is
the
only
explanation
of
the
mystery
i
can
think
of
for
i
assure
you
i
have
not
been
to
the
house
for
months
not
since
long
before
the
the
tragic
death
of
his
daughter
said
he
growing
pale
as
the
words
left
his
lips
by
the
way
a
most
startling
event
occurred
at
the
home
of
lawrence
the
same
night
on
which
your
locket
was
found
said
the
clerk
who
seemed
in
no
haste
to
leave
your
mention
of
miss
lily
recalls
it
to
my
mind
indeed
and
what
was
that
inquired
colville
with
an
affectation
of
carelessness
why
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
young
lady
actually
appeared
to
the
family
who
were
all
assembled
in
the
in
company
with
the
gentleman
to
whom
she
was
to
have
been
married
replied
the
visitor
in
a
voice
of
awe
can
it
be
possible
inquired
colville
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
interest
in
what
manner
did
the
apparition
appear
she
appeared
in
the
doorway
sir
with
her
arms
extended
towards
her
lover
she
was
heard
to
utter
her
father
name
twice
then
the
whole
illusion
faded
out
in
the
thick
darkness
dear
me
how
very
interesting
said
colville
shifting
uneasily
on
his
chair
as
though
it
were
set
round
with
thorns
i
have
heard
of
such
things
but
never
witnessed
any
manifestations
myself
miss
lawrence
was
a
charming
girl
a
pity
she
should
have
destroyed
herself
yes
sir
a
most
lamentable
affair
well
i
must
be
going
said
styles
rising
you
will
let
me
offer
you
a
reward
for
your
trouble
in
returning
my
property
inquired
colville
oh
no
i
thank
you
sir
but
perhaps
the
housemaid
who
found
it
would
be
glad
of
a
trifle
sir
colville
placed
a
bill
in
his
hand
and
the
pair
separated
courteously
the
fine
gentleman
returning
to
his
seat
in
a
tremor
of
anxiety
and
trepidation
while
the
detective
took
himself
to
the
office
of
lawrence
and
after
revealing
his
identity
for
his
disguise
completely
deceived
that
gentleman
he
proceeded
to
detail
the
interview
with
colville
and
its
result
as
we
have
already
described
it
i
took
the
liberty
of
borrowing
the
name
of
one
of
your
said
he
i
suppose
there
is
no
harm
done
none
at
all
i
should
say
returned
the
banker
with
a
smile
and
here
is
the
reward
the
gentleman
gave
me
for
the
housemaid
who
found
the
locket
continued
the
detective
producing
the
money
ah
he
was
generous
commented
the
banker
tucking
the
bill
into
his
vest
pocket
well
and
what
do
you
make
of
all
this
shelton
much
if
i
could
guess
at
the
meaning
of
it
returned
the
detective
frankly
at
present
i
am
all
at
sea
but
from
this
day
forward
until
i
get
at
the
truth
colville
will
be
a
shadowed
man
i
shall
be
on
his
track
like
a
bloodhound
his
agitation
and
alarm
at
learning
where
his
locket
had
been
found
meant
much
and
his
lying
assertion
that
he
had
not
been
at
your
house
that
night
meant
more
i
assure
you
that
harold
colville
was
in
your
house
that
night
and
with
no
good
purpose
i
will
yet
give
you
proofs
of
my
assertion
you
have
done
well
so
far
said
lawrence
approvingly
i
believe
you
will
succeed
in
ferreting
out
that
mystery
and
i
will
try
and
bide
the
time
patiently
and
now
about
the
man
who
had
the
key
of
my
vault
the
night
of
my
daughter
interment
have
you
tracked
him
yet
i
have
answered
shelton
triumphantly
you
have
cried
the
banker
eagerly
his
name
you
remember
the
physician
who
was
called
in
to
examine
your
body
the
morning
she
was
found
dead
the
same
man
who
testified
at
the
inquest
the
man
is
one
doctor
pratt
a
physician
of
fair
repute
in
this
city
and
of
some
skill
in
his
profession
a
physician
shelton
my
god
then
poor
lily
body
was
stolen
for
purposes
of
dissection
i
do
not
think
so
they
would
not
have
run
so
great
a
risk
to
gain
so
little
no
lawrence
i
still
firmly
believe
that
it
was
done
for
the
sake
of
a
large
ransom
then
why
do
the
thieves
not
return
the
body
since
i
have
long
ago
offered
a
ransom
for
it
and
no
questions
asked
said
the
banker
impatiently
perhaps
you
have
not
offered
as
much
as
they
expected
answered
shelton
would
you
advise
me
to
increase
the
amount
i
would
willingly
double
and
treble
it
if
necessary
said
lawrence
earnestly
do
not
do
so
at
present
sir
i
hope
that
we
shall
succeed
in
finding
the
body
and
punishing
the
knaves
for
their
unholy
sacrilege
i
am
loth
to
reward
their
treachery
and
suffer
them
to
go
answered
shelton
earnestly
well
you
know
best
shelton
i
will
wait
yet
a
little
longer
then
but
oh
heavens
this
suspense
is
very
dreadful
i
feel
myself
growing
old
before
my
time
with
the
pressure
of
my
troubles
said
lawrence
passing
his
hand
wearily
through
his
fast
whitening
hair
have
patience
yet
a
little
longer
indeed
lawrence
i
feel
deeply
for
your
distress
and
will
do
all
i
can
to
alleviate
it
said
the
detective
in
a
tone
of
respectful
sympathy
thank
you
shelton
i
believe
that
you
will
said
the
banker
gratefully
and
now
about
this
rascally
physician
you
were
very
clever
in
finding
him
out
how
did
you
manage
it
it
would
weary
you
if
i
went
into
details
lawrence
i
arrived
at
my
knowledge
after
much
time
and
labor
but
i
will
briefly
explain
that
i
furnished
the
old
sexton
who
helped
on
this
trouble
a
deputy
in
his
business
and
disguising
the
old
fellow
thoroughly
i
took
him
about
with
me
night
and
day
until
he
recognized
his
man
and
pointed
him
out
to
me
it
seems
incredible
that
a
man
with
a
good
profession
and
of
fair
repute
should
be
found
engaging
in
such
a
nefarious
scheme
said
lawrence
in
amazement
shelton
smiled
knowingly
my
dear
sir
he
said
there
is
nothing
incredible
nor
even
uncommon
about
it
my
experience
in
the
detective
line
has
made
me
familiar
with
a
hundred
such
cases
men
steeped
in
every
iniquity
are
found
concealed
under
the
guise
of
respectable
professions
or
genteel
business
wolves
in
lamb
clothing
you
know
it
is
shocking
to
think
of
said
the
banker
well
can
anything
be
done
with
this
pratt
should
not
he
be
arrested
at
once
on
the
charge
of
bribery
and
thereby
lose
the
chance
of
tracking
him
to
the
where
he
has
the
body
concealed
said
shelton
oh
no
lawrence
we
will
not
molest
him
yet
i
have
my
eye
upon
him
like
colville
he
is
a
shadowed
man
i
have
a
colleague
in
this
business
and
we
each
have
our
marked
man
to
watch
pratt
profession
takes
him
abroad
so
much
and
into
so
many
houses
that
it
will
be
difficult
to
track
him
but
depend
upon
it
we
shall
run
him
to
earth
at
last
i
truly
hope
so
your
recent
discoveries
have
put
new
heart
into
me
shelton
may
god
prosper
you
in
your
undertaking
said
the
banker
supplementing
this
aspiration
with
a
very
large
roll
of
which
he
slipped
into
the
detective
hand
thank
you
sir
smiled
shelton
that
material
way
you
have
of
supplementing
a
prayer
is
not
a
bad
thought
i
may
count
upon
your
silence
about
what
i
have
disclosed
may
i
lawrence
placed
his
fingers
on
his
lips
with
a
nod
and
smile
all
right
i
rely
upon
you
said
the
disguised
detective
and
with
a
brief
sir
he
went
buoyantly
away
on
the
secret
mission
that
meant
detection
and
ruin
to
pratt
and
colville
the
banker
returned
to
his
with
renewed
hope
and
vigor
the
impenetrable
darkness
that
had
hovered
over
lily
disappearance
so
long
seemed
to
be
lifting
at
last
and
a
gleam
of
light
shone
through
the
little
rift
in
the
clouds
chapter
xxii
shelton
spoke
truly
when
he
said
to
lawrence
that
he
would
shadow
harold
colville
like
a
bloodhound
by
day
and
by
night
on
foot
or
on
horseback
in
various
disguises
he
kept
himself
on
the
track
of
the
fine
gentleman
for
several
weeks
he
kept
up
this
close
espionage
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
seemed
no
nearer
his
object
than
when
it
was
first
begun
colville
comings
and
goings
seemed
to
be
quite
the
same
with
those
of
other
gentlemen
of
his
means
and
position
he
frequented
theaters
and
he
was
a
welcome
and
much
partner
in
and
was
smiled
upon
by
scheming
mothers
with
marriageable
daughters
thus
far
shelton
had
seen
nothing
on
which
to
seize
as
a
possible
clew
to
colville
mysterious
presence
in
lawrence
house
the
night
of
lily
appearance
shelton
had
made
one
discovery
however
though
he
did
not
begin
to
attach
much
importance
to
it
it
was
that
doctor
pratt
and
harold
colville
were
acquainted
with
each
other
and
moreover
that
they
sometimes
hunted
in
couples
that
is
to
say
the
worthy
physician
occasionally
stopped
his
carriage
on
meeting
colville
whereupon
the
latter
would
spring
in
and
accompany
the
doctor
on
his
round
of
visits
seeming
deeply
interested
in
the
conversation
they
pursued
together
shelton
was
puzzled
to
decide
whether
there
was
any
collusion
between
the
gay
man
of
fashion
and
the
busy
physician
or
whether
it
was
only
one
of
those
odd
friendships
that
are
sometimes
observed
to
exist
between
persons
of
totally
different
temperaments
and
pursuits
sometimes
he
was
inclined
to
believe
it
was
only
the
latter
but
he
noticed
a
fact
at
last
that
struck
him
as
rather
peculiar
following
the
pair
closely
on
his
stout
black
horse
he
had
seen
that
colville
always
remained
in
the
carriage
while
the
physician
went
into
the
houses
to
pay
his
visits
to
the
sick
on
this
occasion
which
struck
him
so
forcibly
they
drove
quite
out
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
stopped
before
a
house
standing
almost
a
half
mile
distant
from
any
other
this
house
the
detective
observed
had
a
gloomy
and
forbidding
aspect
being
closely
shuttered
and
surrounded
by
a
very
high
stone
wall
here
pratt
descended
and
fastened
his
horse
colville
also
sprang
out
and
they
entered
with
a
familiar
air
the
heavy
gate
closing
and
shutting
them
in
now
that
is
rather
strange
thought
the
detective
as
he
walked
his
horse
slowly
past
the
place
what
business
has
colville
in
there
i
can
imagine
that
pratt
may
have
a
patient
inside
those
gloomy
walls
but
what
the
deuce
can
colville
have
to
do
with
it
i
am
almost
positive
that
i
heard
shrieks
issuing
thence
when
they
went
in
at
the
gate
i
wonder
can
it
be
a
private
asylum
for
the
insane
he
spurred
his
horse
ahead
and
rode
on
for
some
distance
then
paused
and
remained
as
erect
and
still
as
a
statue
while
he
watched
and
waited
for
the
pair
of
confederates
to
come
forth
but
at
least
an
hour
elapsed
before
they
emerged
and
pursued
the
devious
tenor
of
their
guilty
way
now
upon
my
word
thought
the
wary
spy
doctor
pratt
must
have
a
very
interesting
case
inside
of
those
gloomy
walls
i
have
a
mind
to
stop
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
and
inquire
about
the
inhabitants
thereof
he
accordingly
suffered
doctor
pratt
carriage
to
drive
on
out
of
sight
and
stopping
before
a
cottage
on
the
road
with
the
ostensible
purpose
of
obtaining
a
drink
of
water
he
inquired
of
the
woman
who
gave
it
to
him
as
to
the
names
of
the
people
who
inhabited
the
old
house
with
the
stone
wall
and
indade
it
mesilf
that
can
not
tell
ye
sor
said
she
with
a
very
broad
hibernian
accent
for
shure
mickey
and
mesilf
have
but
lately
moved
intil
the
cot
and
knows
naught
about
the
nayburs
shelton
rode
on
and
made
the
same
inquiry
at
the
next
house
but
elicited
no
encouraging
answer
people
did
not
seem
to
know
anything
about
the
old
house
in
such
close
proximity
to
them
after
several
similar
experiences
he
rode
on
quite
disgusted
with
the
general
stupidity
of
the
neighborhood
almost
two
miles
from
the
old
house
that
had
so
powerfully
attracted
his
interest
he
came
upon
a
little
house
standing
close
to
the
roadside
a
woman
sat
in
the
doorway
though
the
day
was
chilly
and
as
she
kept
knitting
away
on
the
homely
gray
stocking
sang
cheerily
at
her
work
now
that
is
a
old
soul
he
thought
perhaps
her
intellect
is
above
the
average
of
her
neighbors
perhaps
she
is
better
informed
than
they
are
at
any
rate
i
will
speak
to
her
he
dismounted
from
his
horse
this
time
fastened
him
at
the
and
walked
up
the
narrow
path
to
the
door
the
good
woman
arose
in
quite
a
flutter
do
not
let
me
disturb
you
said
he
courteously
i
only
wish
to
trouble
you
for
a
drink
of
water
i
have
ridden
far
and
feel
very
thirsty
certainly
sir
said
the
woman
in
a
voice
as
pleasant
as
her
face
come
in
and
have
a
seat
sir
and
you
shall
have
a
draught
fresh
from
the
spring
she
hurried
away
on
hospitable
thoughts
intent
and
soon
returned
with
a
glass
of
pure
cold
water
the
guest
sat
still
in
his
homely
chair
and
sipped
at
the
water
very
slowly
considering
how
thirsty
he
had
professed
himself
to
be
the
fact
was
he
had
drank
several
glasses
of
water
already
while
prosecuting
his
inquiries
and
began
to
feel
himself
almost
unequal
to
this
latter
one
you
do
well
to
sip
your
water
slowly
sir
said
the
woman
observing
him
for
the
doctors
do
say
that
it
is
very
imprudent
to
drink
rapidly
when
tired
and
overheated
bless
the
good
unsuspecting
soul
thought
the
detective
aloud
he
said
very
politely
yes
madam
i
am
aware
of
that
fact
and
i
believe
some
very
severe
illnesses
have
resulted
from
injudicious
gulping
down
of
cold
water
by
thoughtless
persons
i
always
make
a
point
of
sipping
mine
very
slowly
and
very
right
of
you
too
sir
said
the
kind
soul
approvingly
ah
by
the
way
said
he
i
am
a
stranger
in
this
neighborhood
and
i
passed
a
house
about
two
miles
back
that
powerfully
attracted
my
curiosity
it
was
an
old
building
inclosed
by
a
high
stone
wall
its
aspect
repelled
me
do
you
know
anything
about
it
they
do
say
it
was
a
convent
once
sir
answered
the
good
woman
readily
i
know
the
place
you
speak
of
and
as
you
say
sir
it
has
a
very
repelling
aspect
is
it
inhabited
now
inquired
the
wayfarer
the
hearer
shuddered
that
it
is
sir
said
she
and
by
a
wicked
lot
i
assure
you
is
it
possible
it
is
quite
true
sir
the
place
has
been
inhabited
for
many
years
by
an
old
couple
of
the
name
of
leveret
they
have
no
family
at
all
and
live
there
alone
having
no
friends
or
neighbors
and
it
is
said
that
they
keep
a
powerful
bloodhound
upon
the
place
strange
tales
are
told
of
these
people
but
nothing
is
known
certainly
both
of
them
are
hideously
ugly
and
many
people
declare
that
the
old
woman
is
a
witch
is
either
of
them
sick
do
you
know
inquired
the
detective
that
i
can
not
tell
you
sir
they
are
all
very
reserved
and
hold
no
intercourse
with
people
around
them
i
have
heard
that
they
are
misers
and
have
large
quantities
of
gold
buried
in
their
garden
and
guarded
by
the
great
bloodhound
they
might
both
sicken
and
die
and
not
a
living
soul
be
the
wiser
may
i
inquire
why
you
asked
that
question
sir
asked
she
certainly
i
saw
a
doctor
carriage
standing
in
front
of
the
gate
and
concluded
that
someone
must
be
sick
within
perhaps
there
may
be
sir
but
i
would
not
have
thought
they
would
have
called
in
a
doctor
these
old
witches
like
haidee
leveret
as
they
say
her
name
is
usually
cure
sickness
with
their
own
herbs
and
simples
perhaps
they
failed
on
this
occasion
well
i
must
be
going
said
the
detective
many
thanks
for
your
information
permit
me
to
offer
you
a
trifle
for
your
kind
entertainment
said
he
politely
tendering
a
piece
of
silver
not
a
penny
sir
the
water
costs
nothing
and
as
for
changing
a
bit
word
with
you
why
that
a
pleasure
to
a
lonesome
old
lady
like
me
with
few
neighbors
and
friends
why
it
was
only
last
month
that
a
young
thing
in
trouble
passing
this
way
offered
me
her
fine
diamond
ring
to
pay
for
a
bit
kindness
i
showed
her
but
i
refused
it
sir
i
want
nothing
for
showing
a
little
kindness
to
the
wayfaring
said
the
good
woman
pausing
to
take
breath
shelton
attention
had
been
caught
unaccountably
by
the
mention
of
the
diamond
ring
you
stimulate
my
curiosity
said
he
deliberately
sitting
down
again
the
young
person
must
have
felt
your
kindness
very
sensibly
to
have
offered
such
a
costly
reward
as
a
diamond
ring
aye
she
was
in
sore
trouble
sir
that
i
believe
but
now
i
bethink
me
said
the
good
creature
stopping
short
she
charged
me
if
any
one
came
here
inquiring
for
her
to
say
she
had
not
been
here
and
here
i
am
blabbing
away
at
this
thoughtless
rate
but
you
see
i
am
not
inquiring
for
her
said
the
visitor
briskly
i
am
a
perfect
stranger
in
these
parts
and
i
am
not
looking
for
anyone
so
there
is
no
harm
done
in
relating
this
interesting
story
to
me
why
that
is
very
true
sir
said
she
and
thereupon
followed
a
minute
and
detailed
account
of
the
visit
of
lily
lawrence
and
the
disguise
she
had
furnished
her
shelton
listened
to
the
story
with
very
close
attention
how
long
ago
has
it
been
since
this
happened
he
inquired
when
she
had
finished
her
relation
several
weeks
sir
stay
let
me
see
i
was
so
excited
by
it
that
i
put
down
the
date
in
my
little
memorandum
book
she
said
as
she
began
to
fumble
in
her
pocket
presently
she
produced
the
book
in
question
and
turning
a
leaf
announced
triumphantly
it
was
fully
two
months
ago
sir
it
was
august
the
of
august
the
very
day
that
lily
lawrence
appeared
to
her
friends
thought
the
detective
with
a
start
can
there
be
any
connection
between
the
two
she
was
young
and
beautiful
you
say
asked
he
aye
she
was
sir
not
more
than
seventeen
or
eighteen
and
beautiful
as
a
white
lily
sir
she
put
me
in
mind
of
that
flower
she
was
so
delicate
and
pale
sir
not
a
tint
of
color
in
her
poor
lips
and
cheeks
her
hair
was
pale
golden
too
sir
falling
down
upon
her
shoulders
and
her
eyes
of
a
beautiful
deep
blue
i
suppose
no
one
came
by
to
inquire
for
her
said
shelton
no
one
sir
i
did
not
see
anyone
passing
that
day
except
a
carriage
that
whirled
past
in
a
desperate
hurry
soon
after
she
left
here
let
us
hope
she
made
her
escape
from
whatever
evils
menaced
her
said
he
fervently
well
i
must
be
going
in
earnest
now
my
kind
friend
will
you
tell
me
your
name
i
may
call
on
you
again
my
name
is
mason
sir
she
answered
do
you
live
here
alone
asked
he
as
he
jotted
it
hastily
down
in
his
quite
alone
sir
my
poor
husband
and
my
only
child
have
been
dead
these
ten
years
i
am
quite
alone
in
the
world
answered
mason
with
a
sigh
good
day
mason
and
many
thanks
for
your
kindness
to
a
wayfaring
man
said
the
detective
as
he
went
down
the
path
leaped
into
the
saddle
and
rode
away
mason
revelation
had
thrown
his
mind
into
a
chaos
of
doubt
perplexity
and
suspicion
new
light
began
to
break
in
on
him
startling
him
with
a
wondrous
possibility
he
had
not
suspected
chapter
xxiii
vance
had
done
herself
more
harm
than
good
by
the
bold
avowal
of
her
love
for
lancelot
darling
the
innate
delicacy
and
almost
womanly
refinement
of
his
character
revolted
at
the
idea
of
her
imprudent
and
step
he
could
not
understand
why
she
should
have
lowered
herself
by
declaring
her
love
after
all
he
had
said
regarding
the
constancy
of
his
affection
for
his
loved
and
lost
lily
he
pitied
and
yet
the
feeling
of
pity
was
more
closely
allied
than
he
knew
to
a
feeling
that
bordered
on
contempt
the
fair
widow
herself
was
not
by
any
means
cast
down
by
firm
and
resolute
repulse
she
thought
from
her
knowledge
of
masculine
character
in
general
that
lancelot
vanity
would
soon
overcome
his
first
shocked
repugnance
to
her
unfeminine
avowal
and
cause
him
to
exult
in
the
knowledge
that
he
was
so
madly
beloved
by
so
beautiful
and
accomplished
a
woman
from
that
there
would
be
but
a
slight
step
to
giving
his
love
in
return
she
had
not
driven
him
away
from
her
for
he
had
not
said
he
would
not
come
again
she
would
see
him
often
and
work
on
his
feelings
by
every
art
of
which
she
was
mistress
surely
she
could
not
fail
to
win
him
he
was
young
impressible
and
youth
is
not
prone
to
constancy
to
the
dead
true
he
had
an
idle
romantic
fancy
that
love
is
love
forevermore
but
time
and
her
artifice
would
cure
him
of
that
i
will
be
very
shy
and
humble
when
he
first
comes
back
again
she
thought
no
young
maiden
in
her
teens
shall
outdo
me
in
coyness
and
reserve
i
will
make
him
think
that
my
wild
outburst
that
day
was
entirely
unpremeditated
and
that
i
am
thoroughly
ashamed
and
repentant
he
will
begin
to
excuse
me
to
himself
then
he
will
pity
my
hopeless
love
and
then
ah
then
is
akin
to
love
she
was
sitting
in
the
rocking
leisurely
back
and
forth
while
she
trifled
over
a
delicate
bit
of
a
fire
burned
cheerily
on
the
marble
hearth
for
the
late
october
days
were
growing
chilly
and
diffused
an
air
of
warmth
and
comfort
in
the
large
luxuriously
appointed
apartment
vance
herself
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
elegance
of
the
room
her
house
dress
of
delicate
pink
cashmere
with
trimmings
of
lace
made
a
beautiful
spot
of
color
in
the
darker
more
subdued
coloring
of
the
furnishings
around
her
ada
came
in
from
the
conservatory
with
her
arms
full
of
flowers
and
sitting
down
opposite
the
lady
began
to
arrange
them
into
tasteful
bouquets
you
need
two
roses
to
complete
the
harmony
of
your
dress
said
she
carelessly
selecting
that
number
and
tossing
them
over
to
her
vance
took
the
roses
and
fastened
them
in
her
breast
and
hair
now
your
toilet
is
perfect
said
the
young
girl
in
a
tone
of
admiration
that
was
quite
sincere
for
though
she
believed
vance
to
be
a
false
and
scheming
woman
she
could
not
but
admit
the
perfection
of
her
beauty
and
grace
there
had
been
no
more
angry
passages
between
vance
and
ada
though
the
and
impulsive
girl
had
in
changed
her
opinion
of
the
lady
but
on
mature
reflection
she
began
to
think
that
since
vance
was
her
father
guest
she
had
acted
wrongly
in
thus
declaring
war
with
her
therefore
she
treated
her
as
before
her
sudden
outburst
against
her
with
outward
politeness
and
respect
the
young
girl
appeared
very
lovely
that
morning
her
deep
mourning
dress
with
its
heavy
crape
folds
could
not
obscure
her
beauty
and
set
off
like
the
somber
setting
of
a
jewel
her
transcendant
fairness
all
traces
of
her
severe
illness
in
the
summer
had
disappeared
her
cheeks
were
glowing
with
a
faint
sea
shell
tint
deepening
to
glowing
crimson
on
her
full
and
pouting
lips
her
large
blue
eyes
had
the
serene
innocent
look
of
a
child
tender
orbs
her
golden
hair
simply
drawn
back
and
braided
allowed
a
soft
curly
fringe
to
escape
and
flutter
caressingly
over
her
low
white
brow
vance
hated
her
for
the
beauty
that
recalled
the
image
of
the
rival
her
jealous
hand
had
ruthlessly
slain
while
they
sat
thus
engaged
there
was
a
ring
at
the
and
presently
the
beloved
object
of
vance
secret
thoughts
was
shown
in
he
looked
very
handsome
and
distinguished
as
he
replied
to
unembarrassed
and
sisterly
greeting
good
morning
lance
but
his
face
flushed
slightly
as
he
bowed
distantly
to
her
companion
vance
replied
to
his
greeting
with
a
bow
that
was
quite
as
formal
and
sinking
languidly
back
into
her
seat
fixed
all
her
attention
upon
her
work
not
a
single
glance
of
her
eyes
was
allowed
to
wander
toward
him
she
preserved
entire
silence
while
the
other
two
entered
into
a
simple
and
desultory
chat
with
the
easy
familiarity
of
old
friends
at
length
as
though
her
embarrassment
were
becoming
unendurable
she
rose
with
an
incoherent
apology
and
heaving
a
deep
sigh
quitted
the
room
abruptly
and
did
not
appear
again
ada
looked
after
her
departing
form
in
amazement
what
is
the
matter
with
mrs
vance
asked
she
you
seem
to
have
frozen
her
into
a
statue
i
am
sure
i
can
not
tell
he
answered
with
an
assumption
of
carelessness
but
you
barely
spoke
to
each
other
i
am
sure
i
thought
you
two
were
the
best
of
friends
really
intimate
in
fact
yet
you
seemed
on
the
most
indifferent
terms
just
now
said
she
incredulously
lance
smiled
carelessly
and
reached
out
for
one
of
the
roses
in
her
lap
my
dear
little
sister
said
he
who
can
answer
for
the
vagaries
of
woman
vance
has
always
been
exceedingly
friendly
with
me
but
she
seems
to
have
taken
an
opposite
whim
just
now
but
it
would
not
be
fair
to
question
her
motives
would
it
men
have
to
bear
the
caprices
of
women
without
complaint
do
they
not
i
believe
one
of
the
best
of
the
female
poets
claims
as
a
of
the
fair
sex
oh
yes
osgood
says
helpless
woman
right
divine
her
only
right
caprice
returned
ada
repeating
the
quotation
with
a
very
pretty
emphasis
then
let
us
not
question
vance
right
to
exercise
her
divine
prerogative
i
dare
not
rebel
i
must
only
submit
and
by
the
way
begging
your
pardon
for
changing
the
subject
will
you
ride
with
me
this
evening
i
came
expressly
to
ask
you
i
have
my
new
phaeton
and
ponies
the
ones
i
purchased
for
lily
use
said
he
with
a
smothered
sigh
she
went
to
the
window
to
look
at
them
how
beautiful
how
proud
how
thoroughbred
were
the
restive
creatures
champing
at
their
silver
bits
impatient
of
the
little
restraint
how
exquisite
the
costly
little
phaeton
with
its
luxurious
cushions
of
azure
satin
and
the
azure
satin
thickly
embroidered
with
white
lilies
the
equipage
was
dainty
enough
for
queen
mab
herself
ada
sighed
as
she
thought
of
the
beautiful
form
that
had
chosen
the
rest
of
the
coffin
rather
than
these
downy
cushions
to
recline
upon
it
is
beautiful
she
said
rarely
beautiful
yes
i
will
ride
with
you
in
the
park
lance
wait
a
minute
until
i
get
on
my
wrappings
for
i
believe
it
is
a
little
chilly
she
tripped
away
lightly
lance
looked
after
her
with
an
affectionate
glance
a
dear
sweet
girl
he
thought
to
himself
surely
vance
misunderstands
her
for
i
am
sure
she
is
true
and
sweet
and
kind
how
like
she
grows
to
lily
she
came
back
presently
cloaked
and
heavily
veiled
are
you
ready
he
asked
not
quite
she
answered
i
had
forgotten
to
put
my
bouquets
into
the
vases
she
tripped
around
and
disposed
of
her
flowers
in
the
various
vases
that
adorned
the
room
then
came
back
to
him
now
i
am
ready
said
she
they
went
out
took
their
places
in
the
dainty
phaeton
the
little
groom
in
blue
and
silver
sprang
into
his
place
and
they
were
whirled
swiftly
away
from
an
upper
window
vance
was
watching
for
the
young
departure
she
started
as
she
saw
him
drive
off
with
ada
beside
him
and
a
lurid
fire
of
rage
and
jealousy
blazed
in
her
heart
the
little
devil
she
muttered
clenching
her
hands
tightly
together
oh
that
i
dared
to
murder
her
as
i
did
that
other
one
who
came
between
me
and
him
she
paced
up
and
down
wild
with
contending
passions
i
was
wrong
to
leave
them
together
she
thought
in
bitter
anger
with
herself
he
was
glad
perhaps
that
i
came
away
and
left
them
to
an
uninterrupted
i
myself
that
time
but
ah
ada
lawrence
woe
be
unto
you
if
you
win
him
from
me
the
postman
impatient
rattling
at
the
interrupted
her
angry
mood
in
a
moment
a
maid
rapped
at
the
door
delivered
a
letter
to
her
and
went
away
vance
had
no
correspondents
usually
she
guessed
with
a
sharp
quiver
of
anger
and
fear
whence
it
came
and
held
it
at
arm
length
a
moment
as
if
it
had
been
a
noxious
reptile
the
greedy
old
harpy
she
muttered
indignantly
tearing
it
open
at
last
must
she
bleed
me
again
so
soon
she
tore
the
coarse
yellow
envelope
into
a
hundred
little
bits
then
angrily
scanned
the
note
in
her
hand
it
was
very
brief
but
amounted
to
an
imperative
summons
from
haidee
leveret
to
come
to
the
old
house
and
bring
all
the
money
she
could
raise
chapter
xxiv
old
peter
leveret
and
haidee
his
wife
after
much
bickering
and
mutual
recriminations
attended
by
more
or
less
pummelling
and
hair
pulling
had
at
last
made
an
amicable
adjustment
of
their
difficulty
regarding
vance
secret
old
haidee
termagant
and
though
she
was
found
herself
no
match
for
the
eternal
reproaches
and
brutal
usage
of
her
thoroughly
enraged
husband
and
eventually
confessed
herself
the
weaker
vessel
by
yielding
to
the
pressure
of
a
stronger
conjugal
power
and
revealing
the
secret
of
her
influence
over
vance
at
the
same
time
dividing
her
spoils
with
the
incensed
old
ruffian
it
is
needless
to
say
that
old
peter
greedy
soul
was
not
content
with
these
gains
he
felt
that
the
beautiful
widow
had
not
paid
so
far
a
tithe
of
what
was
due
to
himself
and
haidee
as
the
fortunate
possessors
of
so
fatal
a
secret
i
tell
you
haidee
said
he
the
woman
has
got
to
come
down
heavily
with
the
money
or
i
shall
sell
her
secret
to
somebody
who
will
pay
a
better
price
for
it
perhaps
to
lawrence
or
that
young
darling
yes
and
get
yourself
into
a
fatal
difficulty
retorted
the
wife
contemptuously
let
me
tell
you
peter
leveret
you
have
more
brute
strength
than
i
have
but
all
the
sense
we
own
between
us
is
in
the
head
that
rests
on
my
shoulders
suppose
you
try
to
sell
this
secret
to
lawrence
or
darling
where
is
your
evidence
against
vance
did
you
see
her
commit
the
murder
did
i
see
her
commit
it
did
doctor
pratt
see
her
either
no
to
all
of
these
questions
you
have
nothing
to
urge
in
support
of
your
assertion
except
the
bare
suspicion
of
doctor
pratt
and
if
you
brought
forward
his
name
and
got
him
into
difficulty
why
he
knows
enough
evil
of
us
both
to
send
us
to
the
gallows
ah
that
word
frightens
you
does
it
well
doctor
pratt
would
do
it
willingly
if
we
got
him
into
trouble
so
i
say
to
you
be
content
with
what
we
can
wring
out
of
the
woman
fears
and
let
all
else
alone
she
will
prove
a
mine
of
wealth
to
us
as
long
as
we
can
make
her
believe
that
there
was
an
actual
to
her
crime
well
perhaps
you
are
right
old
woman
said
peter
dimly
comprehending
the
indubitable
force
of
her
statements
you
were
always
more
cautious
than
i
was
haidee
now
do
understand
me
to
imply
that
you
have
more
sense
than
i
have
for
i
do
admit
it
at
all
i
am
more
hasty
than
you
that
is
all
but
i
say
as
i
said
before
vance
has
got
to
plank
the
money
down
more
freely
but
i
have
told
you
she
has
nothing
of
her
own
stupid
retorted
haidee
impatiently
she
is
dependent
on
lawrence
for
every
penny
she
gets
we
must
be
satisfied
with
our
small
gains
now
and
wait
until
she
gets
the
rich
husband
she
is
angling
for
then
we
shall
reap
our
golden
harvest
aye
aye
but
haidee
write
to
the
lady
and
tell
her
to
come
here
and
bring
all
the
gold
she
can
lay
her
hands
upon
said
peter
with
dogged
persistency
so
soon
said
haidee
hesitatingly
her
greed
was
as
great
as
her
husband
but
she
had
a
fair
modicum
of
caution
and
common
sense
it
is
but
a
little
while
since
she
gave
me
the
jewels
old
man
no
matter
write
to
her
again
i
say
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
scowled
peter
wrinkling
up
his
heavy
brows
ferociously
accordingly
the
note
to
vance
was
written
and
dispatched
and
the
pair
of
plotters
awaited
her
coming
impatiently
but
they
little
anticipated
what
fatal
results
to
themselves
would
follow
that
imperative
summons
that
letter
awoke
in
vance
a
burning
desire
to
be
rid
of
the
old
couple
whose
constant
demands
for
money
she
would
soon
be
entirely
unable
to
meet
she
had
a
hundred
dollars
in
gold
that
lawrence
had
kindly
presented
to
her
that
morning
with
a
jesting
reference
to
a
new
fall
suit
her
wardrobe
needed
no
replenishing
and
she
could
spare
this
sum
to
the
rapacity
of
the
old
people
but
she
felt
that
no
sooner
would
this
be
yielded
to
their
greed
than
they
would
demand
more
and
where
was
the
next
to
come
from
it
was
not
probable
that
the
banker
would
give
her
any
more
money
before
christmas
and
she
could
not
ask
him
for
more
than
what
his
own
generosity
bestowed
on
her
she
had
no
claim
upon
his
beneficence
whatever
these
two
old
harpies
would
be
down
upon
her
a
dozen
times
before
she
would
have
another
penny
to
give
them
and
as
soon
as
they
learned
her
inability
to
bribe
them
further
they
would
carry
their
fatal
secret
to
lancelot
darling
or
lawrence
vance
looked
these
difficulties
in
the
face
fairly
and
could
see
but
one
way
out
of
them
the
hideous
old
witch
and
her
still
more
hideous
old
mate
must
die
no
thrill
of
compunction
or
pity
touched
her
heart
as
she
made
this
fatal
avowal
to
herself
on
the
contrary
she
experienced
a
feeling
of
relief
at
the
thought
mingled
with
a
longing
to
consummate
the
deed
quickly
that
she
might
taste
the
sweetness
of
revenge
they
must
die
but
how
her
fertile
brain
could
suggest
no
feasible
plan
for
the
execution
of
the
dreadful
deed
she
was
determined
upon
all
through
that
night
she
tossed
on
a
sleepless
pillow
revolving
various
schemes
in
her
excited
mind
morning
found
her
haggard
and
pale
and
all
her
paints
and
cosmetics
could
not
conceal
her
wretchedly
ill
appearance
she
would
not
present
that
agitated
mien
at
the
breakfast
table
and
had
her
morning
repast
sent
up
to
her
room
on
the
plea
of
a
severe
headache
at
noon
she
dressed
herself
in
a
plain
dark
walking
dress
wrapped
a
double
veil
about
her
head
and
face
and
set
forth
upon
her
errand
she
walked
some
distance
carefully
selecting
the
most
secluded
streets
and
shunning
observation
at
length
she
went
into
a
small
apothecary
shop
and
purchased
from
an
inexperienced
some
strychnine
which
she
said
she
wanted
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
rats
she
paid
for
it
tucked
the
small
parcel
inside
the
palm
of
her
dark
kid
glove
and
walked
on
steadily
to
her
destination
old
peter
and
his
wife
had
just
sat
down
to
their
frugal
dinner
when
her
quick
rap
sounded
on
the
hall
door
they
looked
at
each
other
apprehensively
it
is
she
no
doubt
said
he
in
a
moment
so
the
jade
is
come
at
last
he
had
been
swearing
all
the
morning
at
her
tardiness
haidee
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
unlocked
it
admitted
the
visitor
and
turned
the
key
again
you
see
i
keep
my
engagements
punctually
said
vance
pleasantly
as
she
tripped
in
although
i
barely
expected
to
be
called
on
so
soon
the
hostess
only
grunted
in
reply
to
this
as
she
ushered
the
visitor
into
the
room
where
old
peter
sat
blowing
his
cup
of
hot
tea
he
looked
up
and
gave
the
a
gruff
nod
vance
stood
still
a
moment
taking
in
all
her
surroundings
with
a
comprehensive
glance
then
she
took
the
chair
haidee
offered
her
and
placing
it
in
a
position
to
suit
herself
she
sat
down
she
had
seated
herself
sidewise
from
the
table
but
in
close
proximity
to
that
corner
of
it
on
which
sat
the
old
brown
from
whose
cracked
nozzle
issued
the
fragrant
steam
of
the
hot
tea
by
raising
her
hand
she
could
have
poured
out
a
cup
of
the
refreshing
beverage
for
herself
but
she
smilingly
declined
the
grim
offer
of
the
hospitalities
that
was
made
by
the
hostess
i
thank
you
i
do
not
wish
for
a
morsel
of
food
but
i
shall
be
glad
of
a
glass
of
a
fresh
cold
water
i
have
walked
the
whole
distance
and
am
very
tired
and
thirsty
haidee
arose
and
taking
a
small
white
pitcher
from
the
cupboard
in
the
corner
went
out
to
the
well
at
the
same
moment
old
peter
arose
and
taking
his
plate
in
hand
hobbled
to
the
stove
for
a
portion
of
the
that
had
been
left
in
the
for
warmth
in
that
moment
vance
saw
her
opportunity
her
hand
fluttered
over
the
lid
of
the
and
raised
it
noiselessly
while
a
quantity
of
white
powder
was
poured
from
her
other
hand
into
the
beverage
it
was
but
the
work
of
a
moment
when
the
host
hobbled
back
to
his
place
she
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
her
hands
folded
over
her
lap
and
a
look
of
bland
unconsciousness
on
her
handsome
face
her
nerves
seemed
steeled
against
emotion
old
haidee
entered
and
pouring
a
glass
of
water
offered
it
in
silence
she
took
it
and
drained
it
thirstily
with
profuse
thanks
have
you
brought
us
any
money
asked
old
peter
sharply
looking
up
from
his
voracious
feeding
what
if
i
have
not
she
retorted
jestingly
then
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
my
fine
lady
he
answered
threateningly
old
haidee
had
resumed
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
pray
go
on
with
your
dinner
said
the
visitor
in
a
patronising
tone
the
old
woman
poured
a
fresh
cup
of
tea
for
her
husband
diluted
it
plenteously
with
milk
and
coarse
brown
sugar
then
replenished
her
own
cup
at
the
moment
when
the
old
man
was
greedily
gulping
his
portion
down
vance
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
and
drew
out
a
netted
purse
of
shining
gold
coin
here
is
a
hundred
dollars
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
for
you
said
she
handing
it
reluctantly
over
to
the
woman
and
you
must
understand
that
i
can
not
possibly
get
another
penny
for
you
before
christmas
so
try
and
economize
it
the
best
you
can
haidee
gulped
her
tea
down
hurriedly
as
she
clutched
the
purse
and
the
old
man
hurried
around
to
his
wife
side
divide
fair
is
my
motto
said
he
give
me
the
purse
haidee
and
i
will
count
it
for
you
no
you
do
old
man
she
answered
resolutely
holding
on
to
it
while
her
husband
fingers
worked
eagerly
i
will
count
it
myself
not
a
coin
will
i
ever
see
again
if
i
trust
this
purse
in
your
itching
fingers
she
poured
out
the
shining
mass
upon
the
table
and
began
to
count
it
over
carefully
but
the
sight
of
it
was
too
much
for
the
grasping
soul
of
the
old
miser
looking
on
he
thrust
out
his
open
fingers
and
hastily
gathered
the
whole
pile
into
his
greedy
clutch
except
for
one
or
two
coins
which
escaped
and
rolled
down
upon
the
floor
in
an
instant
his
wife
sprang
up
and
bounded
upon
him
like
a
there
ensued
a
furious
battle
that
defied
description
vance
retreated
hurriedly
to
the
door
and
stood
at
a
safe
distance
watching
the
couple
as
they
fought
over
the
gold
that
was
clutched
in
fingers
placing
him
somewhat
at
a
disadvantage
for
haidee
with
both
hands
at
liberty
pulled
and
tore
and
bit
with
the
ferocity
of
a
wild
animal
at
length
old
peter
tight
grasp
relaxed
the
treasured
gold
fell
from
his
grasp
and
rolled
here
and
there
upon
the
floor
haidee
felt
him
writhing
in
her
clasp
and
loosened
the
hold
she
had
upon
his
throat
and
suffered
him
to
fall
upon
the
floor
he
lay
there
rolling
and
tossing
and
uttering
hideous
groans
while
dreadful
contortions
passed
over
his
features
you
have
killed
your
husband
woman
look
at
his
throat
purple
from
the
clasp
of
your
hands
cried
vance
from
the
doorway
laughing
aloud
at
the
shocked
incredulous
stare
of
the
woman
as
she
gazed
at
her
writhing
husband
at
that
moment
the
suffering
man
gave
a
furious
plunge
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
gave
a
hideous
rattle
from
his
throat
and
fell
backward
with
a
dull
thud
on
the
bare
floor
he
was
dead
old
haidee
stooped
over
the
still
form
like
one
dazed
is
he
really
dead
she
said
in
wonder
feeling
that
it
could
not
be
true
have
i
actually
killed
my
old
man
yes
you
have
killed
him
answered
vance
with
a
fiendish
laugh
ha
ha
old
woman
what
is
your
fatal
secret
worth
now
you
too
are
a
murderess
old
haidee
stood
still
for
a
moment
utterly
stunned
and
bewildered
by
the
suddenness
of
the
blow
that
had
fallen
upon
her
but
as
she
gazed
at
the
triumphant
face
of
her
enemy
her
dazed
senses
seemed
to
clear
and
a
perception
of
the
truth
rushed
upon
her
you
lie
she
shrieked
in
a
voice
of
horrible
rage
and
despair
devil
you
have
poisoned
him
and
me
too
i
see
it
all
now
you
sent
me
out
for
the
water
while
you
drugged
the
tea
but
i
will
have
my
revenge
before
i
die
with
a
dreadful
oath
she
sprang
forward
the
affrighted
woman
retreated
before
her
but
old
haidee
was
too
quick
for
her
in
a
moment
her
strong
fingers
were
fastened
about
the
fair
neck
of
the
beautiful
woman
in
another
moment
her
sinful
soul
would
have
been
sent
forth
to
its
dread
account
with
heaven
but
before
that
critical
instant
arrived
the
old
witch
fell
backward
on
the
hard
floor
writhing
in
the
agonies
that
had
destroyed
her
husband
the
widow
stepped
a
few
paces
back
out
of
reach
of
her
victim
and
stood
regarding
her
with
a
smile
of
wicked
triumph
while
the
witch
amid
her
dying
groans
hurled
the
most
awful
maledictions
upon
her
destroyer
ha
ha
laughed
vance
enjoying
her
revenge
to
the
utmost
limit
did
you
think
you
could
play
with
fire
and
not
be
burned
did
you
think
i
would
destroy
a
beautiful
and
valued
life
like
that
of
lily
lawrence
yet
suffer
two
old
hulks
to
stand
between
me
and
my
cherished
purpose
ha
ha
you
realize
your
folly
now
her
words
fell
on
deaf
ears
old
haidee
had
expired
in
horrible
agonies
while
the
jeers
and
taunts
of
her
destroyer
yet
echoed
in
her
hearing
she
lay
inside
the
where
she
had
fallen
a
hideous
spectacle
of
death
vance
lifted
her
foot
and
spurned
the
still
body
with
all
the
intensity
of
the
hate
that
burned
in
her
heart
they
are
both
dead
she
said
aloud
my
evil
genius
has
helped
me
i
am
safe
now
she
stepped
across
old
haidee
body
with
a
slight
thrill
of
repulsion
and
entering
the
room
picked
up
her
purse
and
began
to
collect
the
scattered
gold
coins
i
may
as
well
have
my
money
again
she
thought
to
herself
i
need
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
no
one
ever
comes
here
i
am
sure
she
placed
the
last
coin
in
the
purse
and
paused
to
look
around
her
old
peter
ghastly
dead
face
met
her
view
the
wicked
eyes
wide
open
and
staring
seemed
to
threaten
her
as
in
life
a
shiver
of
deadly
fear
thrilled
along
her
veins
seeming
to
freeze
them
great
god
she
exclaimed
what
if
my
sins
should
find
me
out
she
lifted
her
slender
white
hands
and
regarded
them
fixedly
there
is
blood
upon
my
hands
she
said
with
an
irrepressible
shudder
they
look
fair
and
white
but
they
have
sent
three
human
souls
into
the
presence
of
their
creator
pshaw
why
do
i
pause
to
reflect
here
let
me
cover
up
the
traces
of
my
crime
and
go
she
took
up
the
shovel
and
opening
the
door
of
the
stove
pulled
out
a
quantity
of
blazing
and
scattered
them
recklessly
upon
the
bare
floor
tossing
one
so
close
to
the
body
of
old
peter
that
his
shock
of
red
hair
was
ignited
and
burned
with
a
disagreeable
stench
vance
turned
away
with
such
a
laugh
as
a
fiend
might
have
loved
to
hear
and
hurried
from
the
house
leaving
the
door
which
she
hastily
unlocked
partly
ajar
it
does
not
matter
she
thought
to
herself
no
one
will
discover
them
the
old
shell
of
a
house
will
ignite
from
the
brands
directly
and
burn
down
to
the
ground
drawing
her
veil
tightly
over
her
face
she
hurried
away
over
the
lonely
road
about
half
a
mile
from
the
old
house
she
met
a
man
riding
on
horseback
towards
the
route
she
was
leaving
he
scrutinized
the
solitary
woman
keenly
but
could
make
nothing
of
her
thickly
shrouded
features
and
rode
onward
some
wayfarer
she
thought
carelessly
and
hurried
on
eager
to
leave
the
hated
vicinity
of
her
double
crime
chapter
xxv
shelton
first
impulse
after
his
interesting
interview
with
mason
had
been
to
rush
into
town
secure
a
squad
of
police
and
make
an
immediate
raid
upon
the
house
of
which
he
had
heard
such
suspicious
tales
had
he
obeyed
this
hasty
prompting
of
his
mind
all
would
have
gone
well
and
this
story
of
mine
might
have
been
concluded
in
a
very
few
more
chapters
but
the
famous
detective
in
his
eventful
career
had
usually
found
it
advantageous
to
think
twice
before
he
acted
he
did
so
in
this
case
and
his
second
thought
resulted
briefly
in
this
he
did
not
consider
that
he
had
as
yet
sufficient
to
warrant
him
in
taking
the
step
he
at
first
proposed
to
himself
he
had
no
actual
grounds
for
suspicion
except
the
fact
that
doctor
pratt
and
harold
colville
had
entered
the
house
and
remained
there
a
seemingly
rather
long
time
for
a
professional
call
from
a
busy
physician
whose
time
was
limited
mason
information
was
all
gained
from
the
oftentimes
worthless
gossip
of
a
country
neighborhood
and
could
scarcely
be
depended
on
as
reliable
evidence
the
mysterious
case
of
the
young
girl
who
had
been
befriended
by
the
worthy
woman
might
have
no
connection
with
the
old
house
and
its
inhabitants
as
he
had
hastily
concluded
at
first
considering
all
the
circumstances
the
cautious
detective
determined
to
wait
before
taking
any
decided
step
and
in
the
meantime
to
learn
more
of
the
mysterious
house
if
possible
his
pursuit
of
pratt
and
colville
in
the
next
few
days
took
him
in
entirely
different
directions
but
resulted
in
nothing
satisfactory
in
the
meantime
mason
gossip
about
the
old
house
and
its
wicked
inhabitants
haunted
him
persistently
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
thought
it
abode
with
him
by
day
and
in
his
sleep
assumed
the
guise
of
the
old
house
actually
preyed
upon
him
after
a
few
days
of
this
troubled
thinking
he
came
to
a
firm
determination
i
will
go
out
there
and
make
some
plausible
excuse
for
entering
if
i
can
possibly
do
so
he
said
to
himself
and
once
inside
i
will
try
to
find
out
whether
there
is
ready
ground
for
suspicion
and
inquiry
his
mind
was
relieved
when
he
had
resolved
upon
his
course
accordingly
he
mounted
his
black
horse
and
set
out
that
very
evening
on
his
quest
he
felt
disappointed
when
he
passed
the
tiny
cottage
of
mason
and
saw
the
door
closed
he
missed
the
pleasant
face
from
the
doorway
but
the
evening
was
quite
cool
and
the
good
soul
was
no
doubt
knitting
inside
by
her
lonely
hearthstone
within
half
a
mile
of
his
destination
he
encountered
a
lady
walking
rapidly
in
the
dusty
road
she
was
graceful
in
figure
fashionable
in
dress
but
her
face
gave
no
hint
of
her
identity
the
detective
looked
after
her
with
no
little
curiosity
that
is
not
the
sort
of
woman
one
expects
to
see
walking
alone
in
this
vicinity
he
thought
she
has
the
proud
air
and
step
of
a
fashionable
new
york
lady
and
she
does
not
wish
to
be
recognized
else
why
that
thick
veil
he
turned
in
the
saddle
and
looked
after
her
again
the
tall
figure
of
the
graceful
lady
was
rapidly
receding
from
sight
around
the
bend
in
the
road
some
intrigue
is
on
foot
he
laughed
to
himself
as
he
rode
on
these
fashionable
ladies
sometimes
find
time
hanging
heavy
on
their
hands
and
well
finds
some
mischief
still
for
idle
hands
to
do
thus
soliloquizing
he
found
himself
in
front
of
the
old
house
which
had
lately
occupied
so
many
of
his
leisure
moments
of
thought
he
dismounted
fastened
his
horse
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
heavy
gate
peering
cautiously
inside
before
entering
being
mindful
of
report
of
the
bloodhound
the
hound
is
probably
chained
up
he
thought
after
a
careful
reconnoissance
of
course
they
would
not
allow
such
a
dangerous
beast
to
run
at
large
in
the
daytime
now
i
must
bethink
me
of
my
excuse
for
i
am
about
to
storm
the
castle
of
the
formidable
ogres
he
advanced
up
the
path
to
the
door
which
greatly
to
his
surprise
stood
slightly
ajar
i
should
have
thought
these
reputed
misers
would
keep
a
locked
door
to
their
house
he
said
to
himself
with
unconscious
disappointment
i
dare
say
they
will
prove
to
be
quite
ordinary
people
after
all
he
proceeded
to
rap
lightly
on
the
door
then
waited
a
little
for
a
response
from
within
no
one
came
to
answer
his
knock
he
repeated
it
once
or
twice
loudly
with
a
like
result
are
they
all
dead
or
asleep
or
gone
away
said
he
jestingly
to
himself
as
he
pushed
the
door
boldly
open
and
looked
into
the
hall
he
saw
nothing
in
the
hall
but
a
thin
blue
volume
of
smoke
that
was
pouring
out
of
an
open
doorway
on
the
right
with
a
bound
he
sprang
inside
and
looked
into
the
room
a
horrible
sight
met
his
startled
eyes
as
soon
as
they
became
accustomed
to
the
cloud
of
smoke
that
slowly
rose
over
every
thing
inside
the
doorway
at
his
feet
lay
the
dead
body
of
an
old
woman
her
aged
features
distorted
and
drawn
as
if
by
her
dying
agonies
near
the
stove
lay
another
horrible
corpse
that
of
an
old
and
deformed
man
the
flooring
in
front
of
the
stove
had
become
ignited
from
the
brands
scattered
over
it
and
was
slowly
burning
through
the
clothing
of
the
man
had
caught
fire
and
every
shred
was
burned
off
of
him
while
his
charred
and
frying
flesh
sent
forth
a
sickening
smell
the
table
with
its
unfinished
repast
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
several
dishes
had
been
knocked
off
in
the
furious
fight
of
the
old
couple
and
lay
shattered
in
fragments
on
the
floor
chairs
were
overturned
and
gave
silent
evidence
of
the
struggle
that
had
gone
on
so
lately
in
the
now
silent
and
deserted
room
the
detective
stood
as
if
rooted
to
the
spot
in
a
trance
of
horror
he
roused
himself
at
last
as
he
saw
what
headway
the
flames
were
making
like
one
starting
from
a
dreadful
dream
heavens
he
cried
out
this
is
terrible
murder
and
arson
have
both
been
committed
here
he
looked
about
him
two
buckets
of
water
stood
on
a
rude
plank
shelf
he
took
them
down
and
poured
the
water
over
the
burning
body
of
the
man
then
dashed
out
into
the
yard
where
he
remembered
he
had
seen
a
well
as
he
came
in
he
filled
the
two
buckets
carried
them
in
and
poured
the
contents
over
the
fire
again
and
again
he
repeated
this
operation
till
the
smoldering
fire
was
quite
extinguished
and
he
stood
weary
and
perspiring
looking
at
the
dismal
scene
well
what
next
he
asked
himself
i
suppose
i
ought
to
go
into
town
and
bring
the
coroner
but
first
i
believe
i
will
explore
this
horrible
den
what
if
the
body
i
have
sought
so
long
should
lie
hidden
in
this
dreadful
lazar
house
he
went
out
into
the
hall
and
looked
down
its
narrow
length
three
doorways
opened
into
as
many
rooms
the
handles
yielded
to
his
touch
and
the
door
of
each
swung
open
readily
but
the
rooms
were
empty
dark
and
cobwebbed
dust
lay
thick
upon
the
floor
showing
that
they
had
long
been
untenanted
with
a
sigh
of
disappointment
he
closed
them
again
and
stood
contemplating
the
stairway
better
luck
in
the
upper
regions
perhaps
he
thought
i
wonder
if
i
dare
venture
up
there
surely
i
can
encounter
nothing
more
fearful
than
i
have
seen
below
slowly
and
with
some
apprehension
he
mounted
the
stairs
not
knowing
what
to
expect
and
thinking
it
possible
that
he
might
encounter
some
further
dreadful
spectacle
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
found
himself
in
a
narrow
on
which
three
doors
opened
he
advanced
to
the
first
door
and
tried
it
it
yielded
easily
to
his
touch
and
swung
open
he
entered
and
looked
about
him
there
was
nothing
suspicious
here
it
was
evidently
the
sleeping
apartment
of
the
two
dead
people
below
who
would
never
need
it
more
a
bed
and
two
chairs
constituted
the
sole
furnishing
some
cheap
articles
of
feminine
apparel
hung
upon
pegs
against
the
wall
together
with
one
or
two
rusty
old
coats
and
a
pair
of
pants
that
doubtless
belonged
to
the
man
he
had
seen
below
there
is
nothing
hidden
here
thought
shelton
leaving
it
and
entering
the
next
room
this
room
was
similar
to
the
first
one
a
bed
and
several
chairs
were
all
it
contained
a
single
article
of
feminine
apparel
hung
against
the
wall
it
was
a
dress
of
summer
blue
and
made
in
a
more
fashionable
style
than
the
one
which
he
had
seen
in
the
adjoining
room
like
a
flash
he
remembered
that
mason
had
told
him
when
describing
the
appearance
of
the
girl
she
had
befriended
that
she
wore
a
morning
dress
of
a
color
and
fashionably
made
great
heavens
he
thought
is
it
possible
that
the
poor
creature
escaped
from
this
very
house
if
so
then
she
was
recaptured
and
brought
back
for
here
hangs
the
dress
that
mason
described
my
god
what
has
become
of
the
wearer
has
some
fearful
fate
befallen
her
echo
only
answered
him
as
he
sat
down
trembling
with
excitement
he
was
here
in
the
room
where
sweet
lily
lawrence
had
dragged
out
weary
months
of
captivity
sickness
and
sorrow
where
her
pure
cheeks
had
burned
at
insult
and
wrong
where
she
had
suffered
the
pangs
of
hunger
and
cold
until
her
weakened
frame
had
almost
succumbed
to
the
grim
destroyer
death
but
it
was
silent
and
deserted
now
the
dead
ashes
strewed
the
hearth
the
empty
robe
hung
against
the
wall
and
the
cold
october
wind
sighing
past
the
window
did
not
whisper
of
the
tender
heart
that
had
ached
so
drearily
within
this
has
been
a
prison
for
some
poor
soul
shelton
said
aloud
as
he
noticed
the
iron
bars
that
guarded
the
window
he
went
out
shuddering
as
if
with
cold
and
advanced
to
the
next
room
the
door
was
locked
but
the
key
had
been
left
upon
the
outside
he
turned
it
hastily
and
stepped
over
the
threshold
to
find
some
poor
creature
incarcerated
within
but
silence
and
gloom
greeted
him
here
also
the
room
was
bare
and
dreary
as
the
ones
he
had
quitted
a
bed
and
a
chair
comprised
its
furniture
and
heavy
bars
of
iron
secured
the
solitary
window
what
a
horrible
prison
house
he
exclaimed
and
what
dreadful
deeds
of
darkness
have
perhaps
been
committed
within
these
old
walls
he
went
to
the
window
and
peered
out
through
the
heavy
bars
at
the
tangled
garden
it
was
faded
and
dying
now
and
the
russet
leaves
of
autumn
strewed
the
deserted
paths
my
god
what
was
that
he
exclaimed
with
a
violent
start
a
strange
sound
had
grated
upon
his
ears
the
distinct
clank
of
a
heavy
chain
and
the
smothered
moan
of
a
human
voice
involuntarily
he
looked
downward
and
saw
a
in
the
middle
of
the
room
now
some
new
discovery
of
human
misery
thought
the
detective
as
he
advanced
and
pushed
the
sliding
door
backward
a
dark
and
narrow
stairway
was
disclosed
he
descended
it
quickly
and
entered
the
empty
room
beyond
a
feeling
of
disappointment
struck
him
as
he
entered
the
deserted
cobwebbed
dungeon
but
guided
by
the
sound
of
faint
low
moans
he
advanced
across
the
floor
and
opened
the
opposite
door
to
the
one
by
which
he
had
entered
here
he
paused
and
swept
his
hand
across
his
brow
as
though
to
dispel
a
mist
that
had
risen
before
his
shrinking
vision
there
before
his
eyes
extended
on
her
low
cot
bed
with
the
horrible
strap
and
chain
about
her
waist
fastened
to
the
iron
staple
in
the
floor
with
her
hungry
black
eyes
glaring
on
him
from
her
skeleton
face
lay
poor
fanny
colville
in
all
her
abject
wretchedness
my
god
exclaimed
shelton
horrors
upon
horrors
accumulate
chapter
xxvi
who
are
you
asked
the
poor
wasted
creature
looking
up
into
the
strange
face
of
the
i
am
a
friend
poor
creature
one
who
will
deliver
you
from
your
dungeon
and
give
you
liberty
said
the
detective
advancing
into
the
room
joy
beamed
on
the
pale
shrunken
features
of
the
prisoner
for
a
moment
she
could
not
speak
then
she
murmured
brokenly
thank
god
for
those
words
i
am
starving
and
dying
here
i
have
not
tasted
food
for
two
days
shelton
in
his
frequent
excursions
had
contracted
a
habit
of
carrying
a
flask
of
wine
and
paper
of
crackers
in
his
pocket
for
his
own
occasional
refreshment
he
took
a
silver
cup
from
his
pocket
and
pouring
a
small
portion
of
wine
into
it
held
it
silently
to
the
lips
of
the
poor
famishing
woman
she
drank
it
thirstily
he
then
began
to
dip
crackers
into
the
wine
and
fed
her
slowly
and
carefully
you
feel
better
now
he
inquired
after
she
had
consumed
a
generous
portion
of
the
food
oh
so
much
better
said
she
fervently
laying
her
head
back
on
its
hard
pillow
while
the
hungry
famished
look
died
out
of
her
eyes
and
a
softer
light
beamed
in
them
i
thank
you
very
much
sir
i
was
on
the
verge
of
expiring
when
you
came
to
my
relief
perhaps
you
feel
well
enough
to
tell
me
your
name
now
said
he
smiling
kindly
my
name
is
fanny
colville
she
answered
feebly
the
detective
started
are
you
any
relation
of
harold
colville
of
new
york
he
inquired
i
am
his
wife
said
poor
fanny
simply
his
wife
repeated
the
detective
a
gleam
of
light
breaking
in
on
his
mind
regarding
colville
visit
to
this
place
then
why
does
he
keep
you
chained
up
here
like
a
dog
he
inquired
indignantly
he
does
not
know
of
it
said
colville
he
does
not
know
of
it
repeated
shelton
in
surprise
you
amaze
me
madam
surely
he
visited
you
a
few
days
ago
i
saw
him
leaving
the
house
i
do
not
doubt
that
he
was
here
it
is
more
than
probable
he
was
but
he
did
not
come
to
see
me
he
believes
me
dead
he
hired
the
old
woman
here
to
kill
me
and
my
child
he
was
weary
of
me
and
sighed
for
a
fairer
face
explained
the
deeply
wronged
wife
yet
the
old
woman
more
merciful
than
your
husband
spared
your
life
said
he
she
killed
my
child
and
let
me
live
because
she
loved
to
have
something
about
her
that
she
might
torture
at
will
said
the
poor
woman
bitterly
she
has
had
me
chained
in
here
for
two
years
fed
upon
bread
and
water
and
an
insufficient
allowance
of
that
oh
god
how
i
hate
that
woman
and
how
i
long
to
avenge
my
wrongs
she
is
beyond
the
reach
of
both
your
hatred
and
your
vengeance
colville
she
is
dead
said
shelton
solemnly
dead
old
haidee
leveret
dead
it
can
not
be
true
said
haidee
poor
victim
with
incredulous
joy
shining
in
her
eyes
i
assure
you
madam
it
is
perfectly
true
when
i
came
here
a
few
minutes
ago
i
found
both
her
and
her
husband
lying
dead
upon
the
floor
and
the
room
in
flames
but
for
my
opportune
arrival
in
time
to
extinguish
the
fire
the
house
must
have
soon
burned
down
and
you
would
inevitably
have
perished
with
it
fanny
trembled
like
a
leaf
in
a
storm
it
was
a
narrow
escape
she
murmured
and
so
they
both
are
dead
did
they
kill
each
other
i
should
say
not
replied
shelton
they
both
looked
as
though
they
had
been
poisoned
they
certainly
died
suddenly
for
their
dinner
was
upon
the
table
this
fact
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
fire
leads
me
to
think
they
were
poisoned
by
some
enemy
who
then
set
fire
to
the
house
to
cover
up
all
traces
of
the
crime
they
have
met
with
a
fearful
punishment
for
their
evil
deeds
said
fanny
solemnly
and
now
i
wish
to
ask
you
a
question
said
her
deliverer
do
you
know
of
any
reason
for
colville
visits
here
now
since
he
does
not
come
to
see
you
the
villain
she
uttered
indignantly
oh
yes
sir
i
know
full
well
he
has
a
young
girl
imprisoned
here
whom
he
is
trying
to
force
into
a
marriage
with
him
shelton
saw
that
she
was
growing
weak
and
faint
and
poured
a
little
wine
between
her
lips
that
makes
me
feel
stronger
she
said
reviving
colville
he
said
you
must
be
mistaken
i
have
searched
the
house
carefully
through
and
there
is
not
another
living
soul
here
beside
yourself
oh
then
she
has
either
escaped
again
or
they
have
removed
her
to
another
place
was
the
confident
reply
are
you
quite
sure
the
lady
was
ever
imprisoned
in
this
house
mrs
colville
oh
i
am
perfectly
sure
of
that
sir
she
occupied
the
room
above
me
for
some
time
my
groans
troubled
her
so
that
she
sought
for
me
and
found
me
here
in
my
misery
and
she
told
you
that
she
was
your
husband
prisoner
yes
sir
answered
poor
fanny
sighing
i
had
her
whole
sad
story
from
her
own
sweet
lips
was
she
a
new
york
lady
inquired
the
detective
evincing
a
deep
interest
yes
sir
and
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
man
if
you
feel
equal
to
the
task
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
all
you
know
about
the
lady
i
am
deeply
interested
in
her
fate
said
he
very
gently
though
he
was
burning
with
impatience
to
learn
more
of
colville
mysterious
prisoner
i
think
i
am
strong
enough
your
coming
has
put
new
life
and
hope
into
me
answered
the
grateful
creature
go
on
then
said
he
did
the
wicked
colville
abduct
her
from
her
home
worse
than
that
sir
she
was
a
young
lady
who
was
murdered
by
a
jealous
woman
a
doctor
pratt
the
friend
and
abettor
of
colville
in
all
his
sins
was
called
in
to
view
the
body
of
the
murdered
girl
he
pronounced
her
dead
in
reality
he
discovered
that
she
was
in
a
curious
condition
known
to
the
medical
profession
as
catalepsy
he
suffered
them
to
bury
her
then
stole
her
body
from
the
vault
and
sold
it
to
colville
who
was
in
love
with
her
they
brought
her
here
used
every
means
to
bring
her
to
life
and
at
length
succeeded
she
revived
after
four
days
and
found
herself
the
prisoner
of
my
husband
dead
to
all
the
world
beside
and
doomed
never
to
see
her
friends
again
unless
she
consented
to
become
his
wife
she
paused
overcome
by
exhaustion
shelton
sat
white
and
rigid
on
the
foot
of
the
cot
regarding
her
fixedly
he
seemed
frozen
into
a
statue
at
length
he
gasped
rather
than
spoke
her
name
fanny
colville
wasted
hand
went
up
to
her
brow
in
painful
perplexity
i
do
not
seem
to
recollect
it
strange
that
i
should
forget
i
am
sure
she
told
me
she
murmured
try
and
think
of
it
colville
much
depends
upon
it
urged
shelton
anxiously
she
was
silent
a
few
moments
lost
in
troubled
thought
at
length
she
said
timidly
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
recall
it
sir
my
poor
brain
is
dazed
by
my
troubles
perhaps
but
i
am
sure
of
one
thing
she
had
the
name
of
a
flower
sir
a
beautiful
flower
i
remember
that
because
it
seemed
to
suit
her
so
well
shelton
eyes
brightened
was
her
name
lily
he
asked
impressively
instantly
a
gleam
of
remembrance
irradiated
the
listener
face
lily
lily
she
said
yes
that
was
indeed
her
name
sir
how
could
i
forget
it
when
i
remembered
everything
else
so
well
i
recall
it
distinctly
now
it
lily
lily
lawrence
shelton
sprang
up
with
a
cry
that
rang
through
the
dungeon
he
was
like
one
dazzled
by
the
flash
of
light
that
broke
in
upon
his
mind
here
was
the
solution
of
the
dreadful
mystery
that
had
baffled
him
for
weary
months
the
confirmation
of
the
vague
suspicion
that
had
haunted
him
for
days
it
was
a
living
breathing
beautiful
woman
he
sought
instead
of
a
cold
and
lifeless
body
no
wonder
the
banker
reward
failed
of
its
object
she
tried
to
escape
from
here
did
she
not
he
inquired
abruptly
fanny
replied
by
relating
the
circumstances
of
lily
two
attempts
at
escape
and
how
colville
had
carried
her
off
the
second
time
from
under
her
father
own
roof
the
villains
the
fiends
muttered
shelton
crushing
an
oath
between
his
clenched
teeth
after
they
brought
her
back
again
she
was
put
into
the
room
above
me
but
only
for
a
night
she
came
in
to
see
me
after
midnight
and
promised
to
come
again
soon
but
she
never
came
and
i
concluded
that
she
had
been
removed
to
another
place
i
am
confident
she
has
not
escaped
from
them
for
had
she
done
so
she
would
have
sent
someone
to
liberate
me
at
once
colville
and
pratt
spent
an
hour
here
five
days
ago
said
he
so
it
seems
probable
that
she
was
still
here
up
to
that
date
no
doubt
of
it
i
suppose
old
haidee
put
her
into
another
room
for
fear
that
she
might
discover
me
down
here
and
also
because
the
in
that
room
is
the
only
entrance
which
she
had
to
bring
my
weekly
dole
of
bread
and
water
through
said
fanny
it
was
getting
on
toward
sunset
and
just
then
they
heard
the
loud
baying
of
the
bloodhound
shelton
started
it
is
the
horrible
hound
that
is
chained
up
in
a
kennel
in
the
garden
exclaimed
fanny
he
has
missed
his
dinner
and
is
hungry
i
suppose
i
will
put
a
bullet
in
his
brain
before
i
go
away
from
here
said
shelton
curtly
now
colville
he
continued
i
must
leave
you
a
little
while
i
will
go
and
report
these
dead
bodies
to
the
coroner
and
i
must
secure
some
easy
vehicle
to
transport
your
poor
aching
body
away
from
here
to
a
comfortable
place
do
you
think
you
can
wait
patiently
i
shall
be
absent
but
a
few
hours
at
farthest
oh
yes
i
can
wait
but
you
will
be
sure
to
come
back
again
she
said
anxiously
he
smiled
at
her
pathetic
tone
yes
i
will
certainly
return
he
answered
confidently
and
i
will
take
you
to
the
house
of
a
good
woman
who
will
feed
you
and
nurse
you
back
to
health
again
i
have
one
favor
to
ask
you
said
he
pausing
you
have
only
to
name
it
said
she
if
it
lies
in
my
power
to
grant
it
it
is
this
when
i
bring
the
officers
here
and
they
question
you
will
you
withhold
the
story
you
have
told
me
even
your
name
it
will
be
very
easy
to
do
so
your
emaciated
condition
and
feebleness
will
easily
excuse
you
from
giving
any
evidence
at
present
i
will
do
as
you
wish
me
sir
she
answered
in
some
surprise
i
do
not
mean
you
any
harm
dear
madam
he
explained
far
from
it
my
reason
is
this
if
this
story
gets
into
the
papers
as
it
certainly
must
if
you
relate
it
to
the
coroner
it
will
put
those
two
villains
on
their
guard
and
though
we
could
arrest
them
on
your
evidence
they
might
never
reveal
the
place
where
they
have
hidden
their
unhappy
victim
but
if
they
are
still
suffered
to
go
at
large
free
and
unsuspecting
i
can
track
them
to
their
lair
and
rescue
her
so
i
only
ask
you
to
postpone
your
evidence
until
such
time
as
i
have
delivered
lily
lawrence
and
put
these
wretches
inside
of
a
prison
your
reasoning
is
very
clear
answered
fanny
i
will
do
just
as
you
have
told
me
sir
thanks
i
will
leave
you
my
wine
and
biscuits
for
refreshment
said
he
smiling
and
putting
them
by
her
side
keep
up
your
spirits
colville
i
will
soon
return
and
remove
you
to
a
safe
and
comfortable
home
he
hurried
away
fastening
the
door
carefully
after
him
and
went
out
in
the
garden
in
search
of
the
howling
hungry
brute
he
found
him
tearing
madly
at
his
chain
in
his
rage
to
get
away
and
seek
for
food
it
made
abortive
attempts
to
reach
shelton
when
he
came
in
sight
but
the
detective
coolly
drew
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
and
fired
a
bullet
into
the
brain
of
the
dangerous
creature
who
instantly
fell
dead
he
then
walked
away
mounted
his
horse
and
galloped
rapidly
towards
the
city
at
mason
gate
he
stopped
and
dismounted
the
kind
woman
opened
the
door
and
beamed
on
him
smilingly
as
she
invited
him
to
enter
he
did
so
and
soon
made
known
the
object
of
his
visit
my
curiosity
about
the
old
house
we
spoke
about
when
i
first
saw
you
said
he
induced
me
to
visit
it
this
afternoon
i
did
so
and
to
my
horror
i
found
the
old
people
lying
dead
in
the
house
while
exploring
it
i
discovered
a
poor
imprisoned
woman
in
a
weak
and
starving
condition
she
needs
to
be
removed
to
a
safe
and
quiet
place
where
she
may
be
carefully
tended
for
she
has
enemies
who
would
not
scruple
to
kill
her
if
they
discovered
her
whereabouts
mason
you
are
a
kind
and
motherly
woman
and
your
home
is
quiet
and
secluded
will
you
receive
that
poor
soul
here
and
take
care
of
her
i
will
pay
you
generously
for
the
trouble
mason
promised
to
do
all
he
asked
her
kind
eyes
brimming
with
sympathetic
tears
and
he
resumed
his
journey
to
the
city
reported
the
case
to
the
coroner
and
secured
a
comfortable
carriage
for
the
use
of
fanny
colville
after
the
inquest
the
grateful
creature
was
removed
to
the
tiny
cottage
of
mason
the
next
day
the
generous
detective
took
care
to
furnish
wines
and
jellies
and
every
needful
luxury
for
building
up
an
exhausted
frame
and
himself
conveyed
them
to
the
new
home
of
the
invalid
chapter
xxvii
my
readers
are
wondering
perhaps
as
to
the
fate
of
our
beautiful
and
unfortunate
heroine
let
us
go
back
a
little
in
our
story
and
take
up
the
thread
of
her
adventures
it
was
the
night
previous
to
the
day
on
which
the
two
leverets
came
to
their
death
at
the
hands
of
vance
up
to
that
night
lily
lawrence
had
remained
under
the
guardianship
of
the
wicked
old
pair
it
was
nearly
nine
when
lily
sat
before
the
fire
in
her
room
her
small
hands
resting
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
her
eyes
fixed
sadly
on
the
glowing
coals
in
the
grate
old
haidee
had
brought
her
supper
in
and
departed
she
was
alone
for
the
night
the
young
girl
was
simply
habited
in
a
neat
dark
woolen
dress
cuffs
and
collar
she
had
none
for
haidee
in
providing
her
a
winter
dress
had
had
no
thought
or
care
for
those
delicate
feminine
accessories
of
the
toilet
the
thick
dark
fabric
fastened
about
her
white
throat
and
wrists
rendered
her
extreme
pallor
and
delicacy
doubly
striking
the
earthly
tabernacle
seemed
growing
white
and
transparent
enough
for
the
bruised
and
wounded
young
soul
to
glimmer
through
she
was
thinking
of
lancelot
darling
her
betrothed
husband
and
now
and
then
hot
tears
welled
from
her
eyes
and
rolled
down
upon
her
pale
cheeks
she
wondered
if
he
still
remained
faithful
to
her
memory
or
if
indeed
the
wily
widow
had
won
him
from
her
as
doctor
pratt
and
harold
colville
had
so
confidently
asserted
it
is
false
she
said
to
herself
through
her
fast
falling
tears
lance
loved
me
too
truly
to
forget
me
so
soon
what
if
i
did
see
him
bending
over
that
wicked
woman
turning
the
leaves
of
her
music
as
he
was
wont
to
do
for
me
she
had
beguiled
him
to
her
side
by
the
fascinating
arts
which
a
true
woman
would
disdain
it
was
to
win
him
that
she
tried
to
murder
me
but
though
i
never
see
my
lover
again
i
will
not
believe
he
could
love
her
after
having
loved
me
even
though
she
might
try
to
poison
my
memory
with
her
false
tale
of
suicide
no
no
i
will
believe
in
the
loyalty
of
my
lover
until
my
latest
breath
she
was
sitting
near
the
side
of
the
fireplace
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
old
peter
and
haidee
who
had
retired
to
their
room
for
the
night
were
sitting
over
their
fire
and
talking
earnestly
together
she
could
hear
the
sound
of
their
voices
quite
distinctly
for
on
her
side
of
the
room
there
was
a
large
cracked
place
in
the
wall
from
which
the
plaster
had
fallen
out
leaving
a
thin
aperture
through
which
voices
were
distinctly
audible
lily
had
never
felt
any
desire
before
to
hear
the
conversation
of
the
old
couple
but
at
this
moment
a
sudden
curiosity
seized
upon
her
as
she
heard
the
sound
of
her
own
name
distinctly
repeated
rising
noiselessly
from
her
chair
she
knelt
upon
the
floor
and
placing
her
ear
against
the
broken
place
in
the
wall
listened
intently
their
words
and
even
the
tone
of
their
voices
were
plainly
audible
to
her
trained
and
acute
hearing
words
were
being
spoken
by
that
wicked
old
pair
that
seemed
to
chill
the
blood
in
her
veins
to
an
icy
current
as
she
knelt
there
listening
to
the
awful
doom
she
had
no
power
to
avert
yes
said
the
woman
voice
sharply
i
hate
the
girl
so
that
i
could
strangle
her
with
my
own
hands
ever
since
the
day
she
knocked
me
down
and
escaped
from
me
i
have
hated
her
with
the
hate
of
hell
aye
aye
said
old
peter
then
why
delay
the
deed
we
have
long
been
determined
upon
i
am
in
favor
of
getting
it
done
and
over
with
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
the
vengeance
of
pratt
and
colville
said
she
hesitating
it
a
terrible
risk
to
run
ten
thousand
dollars
is
worth
running
a
considerable
risk
for
answered
the
old
miser
now
here
is
the
way
we
are
placed
haidee
harold
colville
will
give
us
a
few
paltry
hundreds
for
keeping
the
girl
here
but
her
father
will
pay
ten
thousand
dollars
to
the
person
who
delivers
her
dead
body
and
no
questions
asked
how
can
you
hesitate
which
to
choose
my
god
thought
the
wretched
girl
with
a
wildly
beating
heart
they
are
planning
to
murder
me
i
would
not
hesitate
a
moment
you
know
that
peter
only
that
i
see
the
difficulties
in
the
way
more
plainly
than
you
do
said
the
cautious
haidee
difficulties
now
that
is
the
way
with
women
the
silly
geese
snorted
peter
in
angry
contempt
they
always
make
mountains
of
what
difficulties
can
you
see
i
wonder
how
could
we
account
to
pratt
and
colville
for
her
disappearance
answered
she
easily
enough
i
have
told
you
that
twenty
times
before
old
say
that
she
has
escaped
from
us
again
they
would
not
believe
it
when
they
know
that
we
both
guard
the
door
they
would
not
believe
such
a
tale
in
the
face
of
our
united
strength
returned
she
rather
shortly
say
that
i
was
ill
say
that
i
was
drunk
or
that
i
fell
down
in
a
fit
before
the
door
and
while
you
were
assisting
me
she
rushed
past
and
escaped
say
anything
you
please
to
account
for
it
only
tell
them
that
she
has
given
us
the
slip
they
can
not
help
but
believe
it
knowing
that
she
has
made
two
desperate
attempts
before
that
is
true
she
admitted
still
when
they
find
the
body
has
been
returned
to
the
banker
and
the
ransom
paid
what
will
they
think
then
they
will
think
that
some
designing
person
has
palmed
off
a
spurious
body
on
them
at
first
and
before
they
learn
better
we
can
be
off
and
away
to
another
city
haidee
it
all
seems
so
plain
and
easy
to
me
i
wonder
why
you
hang
back
so
my
god
this
is
horrible
breathed
poor
lily
to
herself
but
a
dreadful
fascination
held
her
immovable
to
her
post
and
then
the
body
itself
pursued
haidee
it
would
have
the
look
of
one
lately
dead
how
could
we
account
to
her
friends
for
that
remember
she
is
supposed
to
be
dead
these
five
months
haidee
you
are
an
old
fool
you
are
getting
into
your
dotage
what
silly
questions
you
ask
to
be
sure
panted
the
old
man
in
a
furious
rage
with
his
hesitating
wife
oh
yes
i
hear
all
that
but
you
have
not
answered
my
question
yet
returned
she
pertinaciously
i
have
answered
it
twenty
times
before
every
time
that
we
talked
the
matter
over
we
can
say
that
we
had
it
embalmed
so
that
her
friends
might
make
sure
of
her
identity
when
we
claimed
the
ransom
the
old
witch
sat
silently
pondering
a
few
minutes
perhaps
that
would
do
she
said
rousing
herself
at
last
it
may
be
that
i
am
over
cautious
i
confess
that
i
wish
the
girl
dead
you
consent
then
said
peter
eagerly
yes
i
consent
she
answered
with
a
ring
of
fierce
joy
in
her
unwomanly
tones
now
that
my
sensible
wife
said
peter
transported
with
joy
i
thought
you
would
come
to
your
senses
after
a
while
well
since
you
willing
i
say
the
sooner
the
better
yes
the
sooner
the
better
his
wife
repeated
after
him
let
it
be
then
suggested
peter
who
did
not
want
to
give
haidee
cautious
fears
any
time
to
change
her
resolution
he
believed
in
the
old
adage
strike
while
the
iron
is
hot
yes
answered
haidee
readily
let
it
be
the
listener
heart
gave
a
great
fluttering
bound
and
then
sank
like
lead
in
her
bosom
through
all
that
she
had
suffered
the
desire
of
life
and
the
hope
of
ultimate
release
had
remained
strong
in
her
breast
how
could
it
be
otherwise
with
one
so
young
and
lovely
and
for
whom
life
held
so
much
now
all
her
hopes
were
blighted
in
the
dreadful
knowledge
just
come
upon
her
death
in
the
horrible
form
of
murder
was
about
to
blot
out
her
young
and
tender
life
forever
from
the
earth
she
clasped
her
hands
together
and
repressing
a
strong
desire
to
shriek
aloud
lest
that
cry
of
anguish
should
precipitate
her
fate
listened
on
who
will
do
the
deed
asked
peter
who
was
a
coward
in
spite
of
his
braggadocio
i
will
said
haidee
fiercely
i
will
get
my
revenge
upon
her
thus
presently
when
she
is
asleep
and
dreaming
perhaps
of
her
home
and
her
lover
i
will
steal
in
upon
her
and
clasp
my
hands
around
her
white
little
neck
and
strangle
her
to
death
it
is
settled
then
said
old
peter
with
a
fiendish
chuckle
of
delight
get
our
pipes
now
haidee
and
let
us
sit
up
and
wait
till
the
time
comes
lily
lawrence
dropped
down
upon
the
floor
and
lay
there
like
one
already
smitten
with
death
oh
god
she
thought
if
i
only
had
not
listened
i
might
indeed
have
been
asleep
and
death
might
have
stolen
on
me
unconsciously
how
dreadful
to
lie
here
and
wait
for
death
each
moment
she
lay
there
shuddering
and
trying
to
pray
as
the
fatal
minutes
crept
on
each
one
bearing
away
on
its
swift
sands
the
brief
span
of
precious
life
yet
left
her
at
each
movement
in
the
next
room
she
shivered
and
started
thinking
that
old
haidee
was
about
to
come
forth
to
execute
her
murderous
task
how
long
she
lay
there
weeping
and
praying
she
never
knew
but
at
length
she
heard
the
clock
in
the
lower
hall
strike
ten
the
next
instant
stealthy
steps
came
gliding
through
the
hall
to
her
door
already
she
seemed
to
feel
the
horrible
clutch
of
old
haidee
hands
about
her
warm
white
throat
pressing
out
the
life
chapter
xxviii
oh
god
spare
me
breathed
lily
clasping
her
hands
in
agony
as
she
heard
the
key
grate
in
the
lock
and
the
hand
of
the
murderess
turning
the
knob
of
the
door
at
that
instant
before
the
door
opened
while
but
a
moment
intervened
between
lily
and
a
horrible
death
a
loud
and
hurried
knocking
was
distinctly
heard
it
was
so
startling
coming
upon
the
previous
utter
stillness
that
old
haidee
darted
back
to
her
own
room
in
a
fright
and
directly
she
and
her
husband
were
heard
making
a
shuffling
descent
of
the
stairs
lily
arose
upon
her
feet
in
a
tumult
of
hope
who
can
it
be
she
murmured
can
it
be
possible
that
rescue
is
at
hand
the
revulsion
from
despair
and
terror
to
instant
hope
was
too
great
to
be
borne
her
slight
form
wavered
an
instant
then
unconsciousness
stole
upon
her
and
she
fell
prostrate
on
the
floor
in
the
meantime
the
old
couple
after
removing
bolts
and
bars
admitted
to
their
astonishment
and
dismay
the
two
conspirators
pratt
and
colville
you
were
not
expecting
me
eh
said
doctor
pratt
with
a
laugh
at
haidee
astonished
look
as
she
blinked
at
him
beneath
the
flaring
candle
she
held
aloft
well
that
cursed
hound
of
yours
was
not
expecting
me
either
he
had
nearly
taken
a
piece
out
of
my
throat
before
he
recognized
my
voice
and
became
pacific
i
had
thought
he
must
have
known
me
at
once
look
you
i
shall
put
a
bullet
in
his
head
some
day
the
brute
if
you
do
you
will
destroy
the
best
safeguard
you
have
against
the
escape
of
your
prisoner
said
haidee
shortly
ah
well
let
him
live
a
little
longer
then
but
you
must
teach
him
not
to
forget
his
old
friends
was
the
careless
reply
you
come
late
doctor
we
did
not
expect
you
and
were
about
retiring
said
old
peter
yes
we
thought
it
better
to
come
by
stealth
said
pratt
shortly
the
fact
is
colville
has
taken
it
in
his
head
that
we
are
watched
by
some
fellow
and
it
suits
us
to
be
wary
just
now
we
wish
to
see
miss
lawrence
at
once
is
she
safe
and
well
as
safe
and
well
as
usual
starvation
does
not
seem
to
agree
with
her
very
well
answered
haidee
leading
the
way
with
her
flaring
candle
it
will
break
her
proud
spirit
all
the
sooner
said
colville
brutally
as
he
followed
them
haidee
stepped
into
the
hall
opened
lily
door
and
entered
nearly
falling
over
the
prostrate
form
of
the
girl
she
started
back
in
dismay
why
what
the
devil
cried
pratt
entering
behind
her
what
has
happened
to
the
girl
is
she
dead
he
knelt
down
felt
the
pulse
and
laid
his
ear
over
the
heart
as
colville
and
peter
entered
after
him
she
is
in
a
faint
he
said
looking
up
into
colville
frightened
face
our
arrival
was
most
opportune
haidee
bring
wine
or
whatever
stimulants
you
have
in
the
house
her
vitality
is
exhausted
the
late
regimen
has
been
too
severe
for
her
weak
constitution
perhaps
he
straightened
the
still
form
out
upon
the
floor
and
applied
a
vial
of
pungent
smelling
salts
to
her
nostrils
in
a
moment
life
came
fluttering
back
and
lily
languid
gaze
opened
upon
the
faces
of
her
enemies
the
white
lids
closed
again
and
a
sigh
drifted
over
her
lips
doctor
pratt
lifted
the
light
form
in
his
arms
and
laid
her
upon
the
bed
as
haidee
entered
carrying
a
glass
of
wine
he
took
it
from
her
hand
and
held
it
to
the
lips
of
his
patient
drink
this
miss
lawrence
he
said
you
are
weak
and
faint
it
will
revive
you
she
drank
it
thirstily
and
felt
a
momentary
thrill
of
returning
strength
rising
on
her
elbow
she
looked
at
them
all
languidly
you
time
your
visit
late
gentlemen
she
said
with
a
slight
inflection
of
scorn
on
the
concluding
word
we
are
obliged
to
consult
our
own
convenience
rather
than
yours
lily
pardon
our
informal
and
visit
said
colville
coming
forward
to
her
side
she
flashed
a
look
of
scorn
upon
him
but
deigned
no
reply
he
turned
to
the
two
old
people
who
stood
waiting
you
may
go
he
said
we
will
apprise
you
when
we
are
about
to
leave
no
let
them
remain
said
lily
imperiously
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
colville
and
i
desire
that
these
may
hear
it
old
peter
and
haidee
looked
at
each
other
in
some
trepidation
at
her
words
and
manner
but
stood
still
curious
and
a
little
frightened
my
muttered
colville
indignantly
miss
lawrence
i
do
not
choose
my
friends
from
among
such
rabble
i
assure
you
do
you
not
said
she
contemptuously
yet
if
you
had
a
precious
treasure
colville
and
desired
to
guard
it
very
carefully
you
would
entrust
it
to
your
best
friends
rather
than
your
enemies
would
you
not
assuredly
he
answered
wondering
what
she
meant
by
her
strange
words
and
manner
you
would
and
yet
you
have
professed
to
regard
me
as
the
thing
most
precious
upon
earth
to
you
while
you
have
given
the
lie
to
the
assertion
by
leaving
me
here
in
the
keeping
of
these
wretches
whom
you
disdain
to
own
as
your
friends
is
it
not
so
he
quailed
before
the
scorn
in
her
ringing
voice
and
the
proud
gesture
of
her
lifted
finger
you
were
safe
with
them
he
muttered
my
dearest
friends
could
not
have
guarded
you
more
faithfully
than
they
have
done
it
is
false
she
said
scornfully
my
life
has
been
in
constant
jeopardy
at
their
hands
ever
since
i
first
entered
this
house
miss
lawrence
you
are
raving
said
doctor
pratt
these
people
have
been
paid
to
keep
you
here
it
is
to
their
interest
to
do
so
and
why
should
you
fancy
yourself
in
danger
from
them
it
is
no
fancy
she
answered
coldly
while
her
scathing
glance
fell
upon
the
cowering
pair
of
interrupted
murderers
like
lightning
a
moment
then
returned
to
the
faces
of
those
she
addressed
i
assure
you
doctor
pratt
and
you
colville
that
your
sudden
coming
interrupted
her
i
was
on
the
point
of
being
by
that
woman
there
she
lies
cried
haidee
and
peter
simultaneously
silence
wretches
thundered
pratt
furiously
reading
guilt
in
their
very
faces
let
the
lady
tell
her
story
then
deny
it
if
you
can
it
is
the
wine
that
has
got
into
her
head
whined
peter
abjectly
silence
fellow
now
go
on
with
your
story
miss
lawrence
said
the
physician
impatiently
thus
encouraged
lily
related
every
word
of
the
frightful
conversation
that
was
indelibly
stamped
on
her
memory
there
was
no
discrediting
her
assertions
the
truth
was
unmistakable
she
was
just
opening
the
door
concluded
lily
when
your
loud
knocking
frightened
her
away
my
relief
from
the
pressure
of
feeling
was
so
great
that
i
fainted
when
i
attempted
to
stand
up
again
pratt
was
foaming
at
the
mouth
with
such
furious
rage
that
he
could
not
speak
colville
pale
trembling
with
chattering
teeth
and
staring
eyes
found
his
voice
first
wretches
devils
he
shouted
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
passion
as
he
pointed
to
the
door
go
hide
yourselves
from
my
sight
before
i
rend
you
limb
from
limb
the
craven
wretches
slunk
away
and
locked
themselves
into
their
room
in
wild
fear
lest
the
two
infuriated
men
should
put
their
threat
into
execution
colville
came
forward
and
stood
by
the
bedside
of
the
young
girl
who
had
fallen
back
panting
from
weariness
after
her
denunciation
of
the
murderers
lily
he
said
abjectly
i
am
so
unnerved
by
the
thought
of
the
horrible
fate
you
have
just
escaped
that
i
can
scarcely
speak
but
believe
me
my
dearest
girl
i
thought
you
perfectly
safe
in
this
place
i
never
dreamed
of
such
perfidy
in
these
hired
servants
of
my
will
this
is
no
time
for
apologies
interrupted
the
doctor
abruptly
make
them
hereafter
when
you
have
more
leisure
and
better
command
of
your
feelings
at
present
the
most
important
thing
is
to
remove
miss
lawrence
from
this
house
immediately
and
place
her
in
a
safer
retreat
he
drew
colville
aside
one
moment
i
know
of
a
place
a
few
miles
from
here
he
whispered
to
which
i
have
the
the
place
is
a
private
and
is
kept
by
a
doctor
who
is
a
very
particular
friend
of
mine
i
know
of
no
better
retreat
at
present
for
our
fair
little
friend
he
will
receive
her
with
pleasure
and
you
can
represent
her
as
insane
if
it
pleases
you
let
us
take
her
there
then
answered
colville
doctor
pratt
took
down
a
dark
cloak
with
a
hood
attached
which
hung
against
the
wall
miss
lawrence
he
said
quite
courteously
my
carriage
is
at
the
gate
and
i
find
it
necessary
to
remove
you
at
once
from
the
perils
that
environ
you
here
put
on
this
cloak
and
let
us
go
i
will
find
means
afterward
to
punish
these
wretches
for
their
perfidy
lily
obeyed
in
silence
and
was
led
down
between
them
to
the
waiting
carriage
the
leverets
did
not
appear
again
nor
did
the
hound
offer
to
molest
them
placing
their
prisoner
in
the
carriage
the
two
confederates
drove
rapidly
away
over
the
country
road
chapter
xxix
the
inquest
that
was
held
over
the
dead
bodies
of
peter
and
haidee
leveret
developed
no
information
that
could
lead
to
the
conviction
of
their
destroyer
an
expert
examined
the
bodies
and
declared
that
the
cause
of
their
death
was
strychnine
poison
large
quantities
of
this
baneful
drug
was
found
in
the
tea
pot
and
in
the
partly
emptied
cups
of
the
victims
shelton
testified
to
the
accidental
finding
of
the
bodies
and
to
his
extinguishing
the
flames
which
had
been
lighted
for
their
funeral
pyre
also
to
the
finding
of
the
chained
prisoner
in
the
gloomy
dungeon
his
evidence
threw
no
light
on
the
subject
fanny
colville
testified
to
the
names
and
general
bad
character
of
the
deceased
but
knew
nothing
which
was
calculated
to
enlighten
the
jury
as
to
the
mystery
of
their
death
she
had
not
seen
peter
for
two
years
haidee
had
been
in
the
habit
of
bringing
her
some
bread
and
water
once
a
week
but
had
neglected
to
return
the
last
time
and
nine
days
had
elapsed
since
fanny
had
seen
her
two
of
which
days
she
was
entirely
without
food
she
supposed
that
the
old
witch
was
putting
into
execution
her
threat
of
starving
her
to
death
this
was
all
they
learned
of
fanny
she
had
given
her
evidence
with
many
pauses
and
turns
of
faintness
at
length
she
became
so
ill
and
exhausted
that
it
seemed
cruel
to
weaken
her
with
farther
questioning
and
it
was
decided
to
defer
it
until
she
became
stronger
and
better
the
jury
in
accordance
with
the
facts
elicited
rendered
a
verdict
that
the
pair
had
come
to
their
death
by
strychnine
poisoning
at
the
hands
of
some
person
unknown
search
was
made
for
the
hidden
treasure
the
misers
were
supposed
to
have
concealed
about
the
house
but
nothing
of
value
was
found
and
the
bodies
of
the
iniquitous
pair
were
committed
to
burial
at
the
expense
of
the
city
they
had
lived
their
evil
life
and
the
world
being
rid
of
them
was
better
off
colville
was
removed
to
the
home
of
mason
and
the
kind
soul
was
shocked
at
the
spectacle
of
human
misery
thus
presented
to
her
view
she
gave
the
poor
creature
a
warm
bath
clothed
her
skeleton
limbs
in
soft
and
comfortable
apparel
and
shingled
her
long
inextricably
tangled
hair
close
to
her
head
this
done
she
proceeded
to
put
her
to
bed
and
feed
her
with
warm
and
nourishing
food
the
poor
starved
woman
could
scarcely
realize
her
good
fortune
she
lay
looking
about
her
at
the
pleasant
little
room
with
its
neat
carpet
and
curtains
its
comfortable
bed
and
cheery
fire
and
feared
it
was
all
a
dream
from
which
she
would
awaken
to
the
horrors
of
her
lonely
fireless
dungeon
but
the
gentle
voice
of
her
hostess
soothed
away
her
fears
and
lulled
her
into
profound
and
restful
sleep
for
several
days
the
most
of
her
time
was
spent
in
eating
and
sleeping
the
warm
room
and
nourishing
food
seemed
to
induce
slumber
and
she
began
to
improve
very
slowly
but
still
so
perceptibly
that
when
the
detective
came
to
see
her
after
the
lapse
of
a
week
he
was
delighted
at
the
change
mason
you
must
be
a
capital
nurse
said
he
smiling
your
patient
looks
very
well
and
begins
to
improve
at
a
rate
i
hardly
dared
hope
for
i
should
scarcely
have
known
her
and
but
for
your
timely
help
i
should
have
been
dead
ere
this
said
the
invalid
giving
him
a
grateful
look
from
her
large
hollow
dark
eyes
i
owe
you
my
life
i
do
not
know
how
to
thank
you
do
not
try
answered
the
detective
feeling
shy
under
the
gratitude
that
was
about
to
be
showered
upon
him
the
revelation
you
made
me
when
i
found
you
fully
repays
the
debt
ah
that
dear
girl
sighed
fanny
have
you
learned
anything
further
about
her
mr
shelton
he
shook
his
head
sadly
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
not
the
wretches
have
eluded
me
in
some
way
and
managed
to
remove
her
without
my
knowledge
but
i
do
not
despair
of
catching
up
with
them
yet
and
restoring
the
unfortunate
young
creature
to
her
friends
god
grant
you
may
she
murmured
fervently
there
is
one
thing
i
wish
to
ask
you
said
he
suddenly
when
you
were
telling
me
your
story
that
day
in
the
dungeon
you
made
an
assertion
that
threw
a
new
light
on
the
subject
of
miss
supposed
death
ah
what
was
that
she
inquired
you
know
or
perhaps
you
do
not
know
said
he
that
the
verdict
was
suicide
yet
you
made
the
assertion
that
she
was
murdered
by
a
jealous
woman
miss
lawrence
was
my
informant
sir
answered
colville
perhaps
she
knew
all
the
circumstances
better
than
the
jury
no
doubt
she
did
he
answered
smiling
at
her
demure
tone
and
the
woman
was
a
beautiful
widow
who
lives
under
the
lawrence
roof
and
is
dependent
on
the
banker
for
the
very
means
of
existence
i
can
not
recall
her
name
for
i
have
a
peculiar
faculty
for
forgetting
names
but
perhaps
you
have
heard
it
i
have
he
answered
gravely
and
indeed
it
amazes
me
it
passes
belief
that
she
should
have
struck
a
blow
so
terrible
at
the
heart
of
lawrence
to
whom
she
owes
nothing
but
gratitude
she
was
maddened
by
jealousy
sir
she
loved
the
young
man
whom
lily
lawrence
was
on
the
point
of
marrying
i
heard
this
from
the
young
girl
own
lips
she
told
me
she
had
long
before
suspected
her
love
and
pitied
her
sincerely
without
a
thought
of
the
cruel
vengeance
she
was
about
to
take
cruel
it
was
fiendish
said
shelton
yes
sir
it
was
fiendish
she
crept
into
the
room
while
miss
lawrence
was
trying
on
her
caught
up
a
dagger
from
the
table
and
exclaimed
as
she
plunged
it
into
her
victim
heart
you
shall
die
because
lancelot
darling
loves
you
horrible
exclaimed
the
detective
miss
lawrence
became
immediately
unconscious
continued
colville
and
does
not
know
how
the
woman
left
the
room
after
locking
her
door
on
the
inside
but
thinks
it
probable
she
slid
down
the
long
vine
that
runs
up
to
her
chamber
window
it
is
very
probable
she
did
said
shelton
heavens
what
a
tissue
of
crime
and
villany
has
been
woven
about
the
innocent
life
of
that
beautiful
girl
but
i
will
see
her
righted
i
swear
it
by
all
that
i
hold
most
sacred
and
then
let
vance
and
pratt
and
colville
look
to
themselves
i
hold
the
evidences
of
their
crime
in
my
hands
now
they
only
bide
my
time
to
see
the
inside
of
a
prison
cell
mason
sitting
with
her
knitting
had
been
an
interested
listener
to
the
above
conversation
the
detective
turned
to
her
now
saying
kindly
we
have
been
discussing
secrets
very
freely
in
your
presence
my
kind
hostess
but
i
suppose
you
know
how
to
keep
silence
regarding
them
wild
horses
should
not
drag
a
word
from
me
sir
without
permission
replied
she
earnestly
i
fully
believe
it
answered
shelton
therefore
i
shall
commission
colville
to
take
you
fully
into
our
confidence
after
i
leave
here
you
will
thereby
hear
a
very
romantic
story
regarding
the
young
lady
whom
you
so
nobly
befriended
some
time
ago
bless
her
sweet
face
i
never
shall
forget
her
said
mason
on
whom
indeed
that
little
incident
had
made
a
deep
and
lasting
impression
i
hope
you
may
yet
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
her
under
more
favorable
auspices
said
the
detective
strong
in
the
faith
that
he
should
yet
rescue
lily
from
her
cruel
and
unrelenting
captors
shelton
said
the
invalid
abruptly
i
have
been
thinking
of
sending
for
my
poor
old
mother
from
the
country
i
must
tell
you
that
i
ran
away
from
home
to
marry
that
villain
colville
i
have
never
seen
my
poor
old
mother
since
but
i
sent
her
my
marriage
certificate
to
keep
for
me
and
to
assure
her
that
i
was
an
honorable
wife
i
have
never
seen
or
heard
from
her
since
i
would
like
to
see
her
very
much
well
he
said
as
she
paused
looking
wistfully
at
him
would
you
advise
me
to
send
for
her
asked
fanny
shelton
took
down
a
little
mirror
hanging
over
the
small
toilet
table
and
held
it
before
her
face
is
it
possible
your
mother
would
recognize
you
he
inquired
gently
poor
fanny
did
not
know
how
sadly
she
was
changed
before
she
looked
at
herself
and
shuddered
oh
no
sir
said
she
mournfully
i
was
a
young
girl
when
i
left
home
i
am
a
skeleton
now
then
take
my
advice
and
wait
a
little
while
in
the
meantime
let
mason
feed
you
and
nurse
you
until
you
get
some
flesh
on
your
limbs
and
some
color
in
your
ghostly
face
then
as
soon
as
you
get
strong
enough
to
travel
i
myself
will
take
you
home
to
your
mother
oh
thank
you
thank
you
that
will
be
best
she
murmured
gratefully
no
thanks
he
answered
and
bidding
them
adieu
he
went
hurriedly
away
chapter

lily
lawrence
leaned
back
in
the
physician
carriage
and
wept
silently
as
she
was
whirled
onward
to
her
new
prison
her
companions
were
very
taciturn
doctor
pratt
was
driving
and
gave
the
most
of
his
attention
to
his
task
beyond
one
or
two
questions
as
to
her
comfort
he
did
not
address
either
lily
or
colville
the
latter
sat
entirely
silent
opposite
the
young
girl
through
the
whole
time
at
length
after
several
miles
of
rapid
driving
the
carriage
came
to
a
pause
and
the
young
girl
was
lifted
out
in
front
of
a
large
frowning
brick
edifice
which
loomed
up
gloomily
in
the
darkness
of
the
chilly
night
she
was
led
up
a
flight
of
stone
steps
and
doctor
pratt
rang
the
bell
the
summons
was
quickly
answered
by
a
small
dark
man
who
showed
surprise
at
the
visit
but
welcomed
doctor
pratt
with
the
cordiality
of
an
old
friend
doctor
heath
this
is
colville
a
friend
of
mine
said
doctor
pratt
as
they
stepped
into
the
hall
we
have
brought
you
a
patient
in
the
person
of
this
young
lady
indeed
said
the
host
bowing
gracefully
to
these
two
new
acquaintances
and
ushering
them
into
a
small
on
the
right
pray
take
seats
my
friends
and
draw
near
the
fire
the
night
is
raw
and
chilly
colville
placed
a
comfortable
chair
near
the
fire
for
lily
and
she
sat
down
and
held
out
her
numbed
hands
to
the
cheerful
blaze
that
burned
on
the
hearth
doctor
heath
took
a
seat
near
her
regarding
her
with
looks
of
surprise
and
admiration
her
colorless
beauty
shone
out
like
a
lily
indeed
from
the
dark
hood
over
her
head
she
looks
very
ill
said
he
in
an
undertone
to
his
colleague
and
unseen
by
lily
he
tapped
his
forehead
significantly
doctor
pratt
gave
a
shy
affirmative
nod
she
has
been
very
ill
he
answered
and
has
had
a
tiresome
drive
in
addition
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
let
her
have
some
refreshments
and
retire
at
once
i
wish
to
have
a
private
conversation
with
you
doctor
heath
retired
to
give
the
necessary
order
lily
blue
eyes
turned
upon
her
captors
with
a
look
of
dread
in
their
soft
depths
doctor
pratt
said
she
what
new
trials
am
i
about
to
experience
here
none
at
all
i
hope
said
he
smoothly
your
health
is
visibly
declining
miss
lawrence
and
i
have
concluded
to
place
you
under
the
constant
care
of
my
friend
doctor
heath
i
think
you
will
find
this
a
more
comfortable
place
than
old
haidee
leveret
and
you
will
have
kinder
treatment
i
shall
leave
orders
for
a
rather
more
generous
diet
than
has
been
lately
allowed
you
for
i
fear
your
constitution
may
be
ruined
by
your
recent
course
of
starvation
yet
i
must
say
your
own
obstinacy
brought
it
upon
you
one
kind
word
from
your
lips
to
colville
would
have
placed
every
luxury
at
your
command
and
i
would
die
rather
than
speak
that
word
said
lily
with
a
scornful
curl
of
her
beautiful
lip
you
will
change
your
mind
doubtless
before
you
have
remained
long
in
this
place
said
colville
in
a
tone
so
significant
that
she
stared
and
looked
at
him
keenly
as
if
trying
to
fathom
its
hidden
meaning
but
she
could
not
read
the
expression
on
his
face
and
dropped
her
eyes
with
a
weary
sigh
doctor
heath
came
in
followed
by
a
neat
young
woman
with
a
large
and
apparently
very
strong
frame
she
came
in
and
stood
behind
lily
chair
this
young
woman
will
attend
you
to
your
room
said
doctor
heath
with
a
polite
bow
i
dare
say
you
are
tired
and
would
like
to
seek
repose
colville
approached
lily
and
bent
down
to
say
softly
i
may
not
see
you
again
for
several
weeks
lily
but
if
you
should
change
your
mind
and
wish
to
recall
me
sooner
you
need
only
signify
it
to
doctor
heath
and
he
will
communicate
with
me
at
once
i
am
not
likely
to
change
my
mind
she
answered
coldly
turning
from
him
and
following
the
young
woman
out
of
the
room
her
guide
led
her
up
a
stairway
and
along
a
wide
hall
with
a
number
of
closed
doors
on
each
side
at
length
she
paused
and
threw
open
the
door
saying
politely
this
will
be
your
room
for
the
present
miss
thus
addressed
lily
stepped
reluctantly
across
the
threshold
and
looked
around
her
she
found
herself
in
a
small
and
room
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
bright
warm
carpet
a
chair
was
drawn
before
a
comfortable
fire
and
a
tray
containing
refreshments
was
placed
on
a
little
stand
in
front
of
it
the
attendant
entered
behind
her
and
closed
the
door
allow
me
to
assist
you
said
she
removing
lily
cloak
and
seating
her
in
the
before
the
fire
lily
lip
quivered
slightly
at
the
gentle
kindness
of
the
woman
tone
poor
girl
harshness
and
coldness
and
threatening
had
become
the
only
familiar
sounds
to
her
ears
this
woman
though
she
looked
young
herself
assumed
a
motherly
tone
like
one
talking
to
a
sick
child
you
would
like
a
cup
of
tea
i
reckon
said
she
pouring
out
the
fragrant
beverage
and
putting
in
cream
and
sugar
and
a
bit
of
this
toast
and
cold
chicken
you
look
very
cold
and
tired
my
dear
thank
you
answered
lily
taking
the
tea
and
drinking
it
thirstily
after
her
long
fast
upon
bread
and
water
the
food
tasted
simply
delicious
to
her
she
did
not
know
how
much
its
quality
was
sweetened
by
the
kind
looks
of
her
attendant
who
sat
by
and
watched
her
with
a
smile
on
her
round
and
rosy
face
perhaps
you
would
like
me
to
help
you
to
bed
before
i
take
away
the
tray
said
she
as
lily
finished
her
tea
and
leaned
back
wearily
in
her
chair
thanks
presently
i
will
avail
myself
of
your
kindness
but
now
i
wish
to
ask
you
some
questions
said
lily
quietly
yes
miss
said
the
woman
kindly
but
she
looked
at
lily
with
a
great
deal
of
surprise
at
her
tone
what
is
your
name
inquired
the
young
prisoner
mary
brown
if
you
please
miss
answered
the
woman
in
her
kind
soothing
tone
you
live
here
i
suppose
mary
pursued
the
young
girl
yes
miss
then
mary
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
kind
of
a
house
this
is
i
have
been
fancying
that
it
must
be
a
hospital
as
there
seems
to
be
a
resident
physician
am
i
right
oh
yes
miss
certainly
this
is
a
hospital
we
have
a
number
of
sick
people
here
said
the
woman
like
one
humoring
an
inquisitive
child
but
do
you
wish
to
retire
now
miss
it
about
midnight
i
should
think
in
a
minute
mary
tell
me
first
is
it
a
public
hospital
oh
no
miss
it
perfectly
private
and
very
select
indeed
we
receive
none
but
people
here
we
do
indeed
she
was
turning
down
the
covers
of
the
bed
as
she
spoke
and
now
she
said
persuasively
come
now
let
me
help
you
to
bed
miss
i
want
to
tuck
you
up
warm
and
comfortable
before
i
leave
you
lily
submitted
patiently
but
as
she
laid
her
tired
head
on
the
pillow
she
asked
suddenly
is
heath
a
good
man
mary
la
now
miss
you
must
judge
of
that
yourself
you
will
see
him
often
enough
before
you
get
well
said
mary
brown
lily
was
about
to
open
her
lips
to
refute
the
charge
of
her
illness
when
she
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
a
wild
and
piercing
shriek
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
room
that
was
next
her
own
in
her
alarm
she
sprang
up
and
caught
mary
brown
arms
in
both
hers
shuddering
with
surprise
and
terror
oh
what
is
it
she
cried
as
the
wild
shriek
was
repeated
again
and
again
mingled
with
frenzied
shouts
and
peal
after
peal
of
frightful
demoniacal
laughter
it
only
one
of
the
sick
ones
miss
said
mary
brown
uneasily
do
fret
yourself
my
dear
lie
down
again
he
will
soon
be
quiet
and
then
you
can
go
to
sleep
a
horrible
suspicion
flashed
into
lily
mind
mary
brown
you
have
been
deceiving
me
with
your
kind
face
and
friendly
talk
this
is
not
a
hospital
for
the
sick
it
is
a
private
is
it
not
well
it
is
for
people
who
are
sick
in
their
heads
admitted
mary
you
mean
for
people
who
are
insane
said
she
holding
tightly
to
the
woman
arm
mary
brown
nodded
acquiescence
lily
was
silent
a
moment
lost
in
painful
thought
at
length
she
said
sadly
i
hope
you
do
not
think
that
i
am
insane
mary
brown
oh
dear
no
miss
said
mary
in
her
placid
tone
of
course
not
but
you
believe
it
i
can
see
that
plainly
cried
lily
in
an
anguished
tone
you
have
been
humoring
and
petting
me
taking
me
for
some
insane
creature
but
i
assure
you
i
am
not
i
am
perfectly
sane
though
i
have
suffered
cruelty
and
injustice
enough
to
have
driven
me
mad
long
ago
i
have
been
brought
here
by
two
wicked
men
to
be
made
a
prisoner
because
i
will
not
marry
a
man
whom
i
hate
you
poor
injured
dear
said
the
good
nurse
affecting
to
believe
the
young
girl
story
though
in
her
heart
she
set
it
down
simply
as
one
of
the
vagaries
of
madness
you
do
not
believe
me
cried
lily
passionately
oh
god
is
this
crowning
insult
to
be
added
to
my
sufferings
must
they
represent
me
as
mad
and
thus
drive
me
into
insanity
indeed
the
attendant
began
to
think
that
her
beautiful
and
gentle
patient
was
becoming
violent
she
gently
but
forcibly
released
her
arms
from
clasp
and
laid
the
moaning
girl
back
on
her
pillow
my
dear
she
said
you
must
not
excite
yourself
you
look
too
ill
to
stand
agitation
i
must
go
now
and
help
doctor
heath
to
manage
that
poor
shrieking
maniac
in
the
next
room
try
and
go
to
sleep
my
pretty
dear
she
drew
the
warm
covers
up
carefully
over
the
patient
brushed
back
the
disordered
golden
hair
with
a
coarse
but
kindly
hand
extinguished
the
light
and
taking
up
the
tray
of
dishes
went
out
carefully
locking
the
door
after
her
in
the
hall
she
encountered
doctor
heath
about
entering
the
room
of
the
shrieking
patient
he
paused
at
sight
of
her
how
is
your
new
patient
he
inquired
abruptly
a
little
excited
at
present
sir
she
appeared
very
quiet
and
sensible
at
first
but
after
the
violent
patient
began
his
shrieks
she
became
violent
and
wild
sir
did
she
tell
you
her
name
he
inquired
mary
brown
replied
in
the
negative
her
case
is
rather
peculiar
said
doctor
heath
she
is
the
victim
of
a
strange
hallucination
a
wealthy
young
lady
of
new
york
committed
suicide
last
summer
under
very
romantic
circumstances
this
young
person
imagines
herself
to
be
the
identical
young
lady
who
killed
herself
and
asserts
that
she
was
resurrected
by
a
physician
and
his
friend
who
detain
her
in
durance
vile
because
the
latter
wishes
to
marry
her
she
will
tell
you
her
story
of
course
do
not
contradict
her
but
gently
humor
her
she
will
not
give
you
much
trouble
i
think
as
it
is
a
mere
case
of
melancholy
madness
the
young
lady
she
personates
was
named
miss
lawrence
be
particular
and
call
her
by
that
name
mary
i
will
sir
said
mary
passing
on
chapter
xxxi
vance
read
in
the
daily
papers
an
account
on
the
inquest
that
had
been
held
over
the
dead
bodies
of
her
two
victims
she
was
surprised
and
troubled
at
first
because
her
scheme
for
burning
the
house
down
and
destroying
the
bodies
had
failed
but
as
she
saw
that
no
clew
to
the
perpetrator
of
the
poisoning
had
been
discovered
her
courage
rose
in
proportion
i
am
free
now
she
thought
with
a
guilty
thrill
of
triumph
the
two
old
harpies
who
preyed
upon
me
are
dead
and
their
secret
with
them
no
one
will
ever
discover
my
agency
in
their
death
suspicion
would
never
dream
of
fastening
upon
me
who
would
believe
that
these
white
hands
could
be
stained
with
crime
she
held
them
up
admiring
their
delicate
whiteness
and
the
costly
rings
that
glittered
upon
them
then
went
to
the
mirror
and
looked
at
her
handsome
reflection
i
am
beautiful
she
said
to
herself
with
a
proud
smile
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
win
lancelot
darling
a
woman
can
marry
whom
she
will
when
she
is
gifted
with
beauty
and
grace
like
mine
and
i
will
yet
be
lancelot
darling
wife
i
solemnly
swear
that
i
will
in
the
exuberance
of
her
triumph
and
her
pride
in
herself
she
ordered
the
carriage
and
went
out
to
spend
the
money
she
had
rescued
from
peter
and
haidee
in
some
new
feminine
adornment
wherewith
to
deck
her
beauty
for
the
eyes
of
the
obdurate
young
millionaire
time
flew
past
and
brought
the
cold
and
freezing
days
of
november
the
latter
part
of
it
was
exceedingly
cold
and
snow
covered
the
ground
with
a
thick
white
crust
lancelot
darling
came
into
the
one
day
where
ada
and
the
beautiful
widow
sat
by
the
glowing
fire
vance
busy
as
usual
with
some
trifle
of
fancy
work
and
ada
yawning
over
the
latest
novel
they
welcomed
him
without
surprise
or
formality
for
he
had
fallen
into
a
habit
of
dropping
in
familiarly
and
with
the
freedom
of
a
brother
vance
after
the
first
few
weeks
of
affected
shyness
and
prudence
had
resumed
her
old
frank
relations
with
lance
though
but
feebly
seconded
by
that
young
man
who
had
not
recovered
from
the
shock
of
her
unwomanly
avowal
of
love
for
himself
well
ada
how
does
the
novel
please
you
he
inquired
looking
at
the
book
that
she
had
laid
aside
either
the
author
is
very
dull
or
i
am
out
of
spirits
she
returned
smiling
for
i
have
failed
to
become
interested
in
the
woes
of
the
heroine
this
morning
have
you
read
it
lance
oh
yes
a
week
ago
he
answered
carelessly
i
found
it
readable
and
interesting
i
dare
say
you
are
in
fault
not
the
author
you
are
out
of
tune
perhaps
so
said
ada
but
what
am
i
to
do
about
it
can
you
suggest
a
remedy
the
sleighing
is
very
fine
just
now
he
returned
it
thrills
one
very
pleasurably
have
you
tried
it
oh
yes
vance
and
myself
have
been
out
twice
with
papa
this
week
by
daylight
he
queried
yes
by
daylight
she
answered
the
latest
sensation
however
is
by
moonlight
rejoined
lance
there
is
a
full
moon
you
know
and
the
nights
are
superb
parties
go
out
to
dabney
hotel
it
is
far
out
on
the
suburbs
and
have
hot
coffee
and
oysters
by
way
of
refreshment
you
know
then
they
return
to
the
city
getting
home
near
midnight
usually
altogether
it
is
very
exhilarating
you
speak
from
experience
i
presume
said
ada
yes
i
tried
it
myself
last
night
being
induced
thereto
by
the
glowing
representations
of
two
young
friends
of
mine
i
found
the
drive
quite
as
bracing
and
delightful
as
they
described
it
i
should
be
tempted
to
try
it
again
if
i
could
persuade
you
ada
and
vance
to
accompany
me
why
that
would
be
delightful
said
ada
clapping
her
hands
with
the
pleasure
of
a
child
over
a
new
toy
i
think
that
is
just
what
i
am
needing
a
new
sensation
you
consent
then
said
he
smiling
at
her
pretty
enthusiasm
oh
yes
if
vance
will
go
too
will
you
do
so
inquired
she
turning
to
the
lady
who
had
as
yet
taken
no
part
in
the
conversation
do
you
wish
to
go
very
much
inquired
she
looking
up
from
her
work
with
a
very
pleasant
smile
i
think
i
should
enjoy
it
very
much
i
do
know
that
i
care
for
it
very
much
said
the
widow
with
a
light
sigh
but
i
will
go
to
please
you
ada
it
is
settled
then
said
lance
we
will
go
and
i
think
i
can
promise
you
both
a
very
enjoyable
evening
it
could
not
fail
to
be
otherwise
vance
thought
to
herself
with
a
thrill
of
pleasure
at
the
knowledge
that
she
would
be
seated
beside
him
for
hours
hearing
his
musical
voice
and
looking
into
his
handsome
face
if
it
were
not
for
that
hateful
ada
going
too
she
said
to
herself
what
a
chance
i
could
have
to
make
an
impression
on
his
heart
but
regret
it
as
she
would
she
could
not
prevent
ada
from
going
for
she
saw
plainly
enough
that
the
excursion
was
planned
for
the
young
pleasure
not
her
own
she
was
merely
secondary
in
the
affair
a
thrill
of
jealous
pain
cut
through
her
heart
like
a
knife
and
the
furtive
glance
of
hatred
she
cast
upon
ada
boded
no
good
to
the
lovely
and
young
girl
night
came
and
lance
appeared
with
his
elegant
little
sleigh
the
ladies
comfortably
arrayed
in
sealskin
cloaks
and
hats
were
helped
into
the
sleigh
the
warm
buffalo
robes
were
tucked
around
them
and
taking
the
reins
in
hand
lance
started
out
at
a
dashing
pace
over
the
smooth
and
shining
crust
of
snow
the
moon
shone
gloriously
making
the
ground
look
as
if
paved
with
sparkling
gems
the
silver
bells
rang
out
a
merry
chime
and
the
hearts
of
all
three
seemed
to
fill
with
pleasure
at
the
joyous
sound
and
the
breath
of
winter
seemed
like
a
caress
as
it
sighed
past
their
warm
and
glowing
cheeks
numbers
of
merry
were
out
enjoying
the
fine
sleighing
and
the
beautiful
night
gay
words
and
happy
laughter
rang
out
from
youthful
voices
and
many
a
heart
beat
high
with
hope
and
love
vance
and
ada
enjoyed
their
moonlight
ride
very
much
and
found
their
appetite
sharpened
for
the
delicious
supper
which
was
ready
for
them
when
they
arrived
at
their
destination
they
met
several
of
their
friends
at
dabney
hotel
on
the
same
pleasant
mission
as
themselves
and
enjoyed
an
hour
of
social
converse
before
starting
on
their
homeward
way
they
were
the
last
to
leave
it
has
been
very
pleasant
said
ada
impulsively
as
lance
tucked
the
buffalo
robes
around
them
preparatory
to
starting
i
am
glad
you
have
enjoyed
it
answered
the
young
man
touching
up
his
spirited
horses
and
starting
off
in
gallant
style
they
had
gone
about
half
a
mile
when
in
turning
a
corner
the
mettlesome
young
horses
became
suddenly
frightened
at
something
and
reared
upward
nearly
upsetting
the
sleigh
and
its
occupants
with
a
grasp
of
steel
lance
tried
to
bring
them
down
upon
their
feet
but
succeeded
only
to
see
them
start
away
at
a
maddened
and
furious
pace
entirely
beyond
his
control
while
shriek
after
shriek
of
terror
burst
from
the
two
ladies
as
they
clung
to
lance
impeded
by
the
clinging
arms
of
the
two
and
distressed
beyond
measure
by
their
frightened
screams
it
was
impossible
for
lance
to
do
anything
to
help
them
though
he
held
on
to
the
reins
so
tightly
that
his
hands
were
wounded
and
bleeding
his
utmost
strength
was
insufficient
to
arrest
the
speed
of
the
horses
they
ran
faster
and
faster
as
though
incited
to
greater
speed
by
the
screams
of
the
women
at
length
with
a
frantic
effort
they
cleared
themselves
of
the
sleigh
and
bounded
away
leaving
the
dainty
vehicle
overturned
and
broken
and
its
occupants
reposing
in
a
lance
was
the
first
to
lift
himself
up
and
look
about
he
felt
as
if
every
bone
in
his
body
were
broken
so
swift
had
been
the
impetus
that
hurled
him
out
but
repressing
his
own
pain
he
hastened
to
his
two
companions
ada
vance
are
either
of
you
hurt
he
inquired
anxiously
vance
was
already
on
her
feet
shaking
the
loose
snow
from
her
hair
and
dress
i
believe
i
am
quite
uninjured
beyond
the
shock
of
the
fall
said
she
are
you
lance
oh
i
am
all
right
said
he
but
ada
my
dear
girl
are
you
hurt
ada
answered
his
query
with
a
moan
of
pain
but
made
no
effort
to
rise
he
bent
over
her
and
lifted
the
slight
form
in
his
strong
arms
can
you
stand
he
inquired
anxiously
oh
no
no
she
moaned
my
ankle
seems
to
be
twisted
or
sprained
and
my
head
struck
something
hard
like
a
rock
in
falling
it
aches
dreadfully
she
burst
into
tears
sobbing
aloud
in
her
pain
lance
looked
about
him
in
despair
there
he
was
in
the
road
several
miles
from
the
city
with
two
helpless
females
to
take
care
of
and
his
broken
sleigh
lying
useless
the
horses
quite
out
of
sight
worse
than
all
ada
lying
helpless
in
his
arms
unable
to
stand
or
walk
and
moaning
like
a
child
in
her
acute
suffering
this
is
terrible
he
said
what
can
we
do
mrs
vance
nothing
said
she
coldly
maddened
by
the
sight
of
ada
head
resting
against
his
shoulder
except
to
remain
here
and
freeze
to
death
waiting
for
some
other
vehicle
to
happen
along
and
take
us
home
something
may
happen
along
at
any
minute
he
answered
encouragingly
there
are
numbers
of
people
out
as
well
as
ourselves
it
is
quite
probable
that
we
are
the
last
on
the
road
said
she
doubtfully
indeed
i
believe
that
we
are
if
ada
were
unhurt
i
should
suggest
that
we
walk
home
or
back
to
the
hotel
at
least
ada
my
dear
rouse
yourself
and
do
not
weep
so
childishly
do
you
not
see
what
a
plight
you
are
putting
us
in
i
am
quite
sure
you
can
walk
a
little
if
you
will
only
try
to
make
an
effort
thus
adjured
ada
lifted
herself
and
tried
to
put
her
foot
on
the
ground
and
stand
up
it
is
useless
said
she
falling
back
with
a
sharp
cry
my
ankle
is
too
badly
hurt
i
can
not
stand
upon
it
ere
she
ceased
to
speak
the
welcome
tinkle
of
in
the
distance
saluted
their
ears
thank
heaven
ejaculated
lance
we
have
but
a
moment
to
wait
relief
is
at
hand
how
fortunate
chimed
in
vance
recovering
her
good
humor
at
the
prospect
of
help
in
their
extremity
directly
a
splendid
little
sleigh
drove
up
to
them
stopped
and
the
single
occupant
a
handsome
young
man
jumped
out
what
is
the
trouble
here
he
inquired
in
a
genial
friendly
voice
why
upon
my
word
with
a
start
of
surprise
it
you
lance
is
it
not
yes
it
is
i
phil
and
i
was
never
so
glad
to
see
you
before
in
my
life
answered
lance
in
a
tone
of
relief
vance
miss
lawrence
this
is
my
best
friend
philip
st
john
you
have
met
with
an
accident
said
john
after
briefly
acknowledging
this
presentation
to
the
ladies
yes
my
horses
ran
off
and
overturned
the
sleigh
pitching
us
into
the
road
vance
and
myself
luckily
escaped
unhurt
but
miss
lawrence
has
sustained
an
injury
that
incapacitates
her
for
walking
perhaps
i
can
help
you
said
the
cordially
my
sleigh
is
very
small
but
it
will
be
roomy
enough
to
accommodate
one
of
these
ladies
i
am
sure
now
if
miss
lawrence
will
trust
herself
to
my
care
i
will
take
her
home
immediately
and
lance
if
you
and
vance
can
stand
a
walk
of
a
mile
back
to
dabney
hotel
you
will
find
that
they
keep
a
good
trap
there
and
you
can
get
it
to
return
in
what
do
you
say
to
my
friend
plan
ada
asked
lance
looking
down
at
her
as
she
leaned
upon
his
arm
will
you
allow
john
to
take
you
home
i
assure
you
he
will
take
the
kindest
care
of
you
i
accept
his
offer
with
thanks
said
ada
gratefully
but
it
seems
selfish
to
leave
vance
and
you
to
trudge
back
to
the
hotel
on
foot
my
dear
child
pray
do
not
distress
yourself
on
that
score
said
vance
in
her
kindest
tone
i
feel
so
thankful
for
this
timely
assistance
in
your
behalf
that
i
shall
not
mind
the
long
walk
at
all
it
is
the
best
thing
they
can
do
miss
lawrence
said
john
respectfully
they
would
freeze
if
they
remained
here
waiting
till
i
sent
a
conveyance
out
from
the
city
but
if
they
walk
back
to
the
hotel
they
can
get
dabney
sleigh
and
follow
us
directly
ada
was
accordingly
lifted
into
the
very
small
sleigh
of
john
the
robes
from
lance
useless
sleigh
were
brought
and
tucked
around
her
and
in
a
minute
she
was
off
like
the
wind
for
home
feeling
in
spite
of
her
pain
a
very
shy
consciousness
of
her
proximity
to
the
handsome
young
stranger
lancelot
and
his
fair
companion
in
distress
set
off
rather
soberly
on
their
return
to
dabney
hotel
chapter
xxxii
it
was
rather
an
embarrassing
position
to
be
placed
in
both
for
lancelot
and
the
handsome
widow
after
some
little
desultory
conversation
they
both
relapsed
into
silence
and
walked
soberly
on
their
way
vance
at
length
broke
the
silence
in
a
low
and
very
faltering
voice
lance
she
murmured
i
must
avail
myself
of
this
the
only
opportunity
i
have
had
to
crave
your
pardon
and
forgetfulness
for
a
confession
which
i
too
sadly
remember
with
blushes
of
shame
for
my
madness
and
folly
forgive
me
for
recurring
to
that
moment
of
frenzy
and
shame
i
only
do
so
to
entreat
your
pardon
and
crave
your
forgetfulness
he
felt
the
small
hand
trembling
within
his
arm
where
it
rested
like
a
fluttering
bird
looking
down
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
he
saw
tears
shining
like
drops
of
dew
on
her
lashes
he
did
not
answer
and
she
continued
in
a
voice
full
of
sadness
and
shame
words
can
not
paint
my
grief
and
shame
for
that
deeply
deplored
confession
not
shame
that
i
love
you
lance
but
shame
that
in
an
hour
of
impulsive
and
passionate
abandonment
i
showed
you
the
secret
of
my
heart
and
gained
in
return
your
bitterest
scorn
no
no
you
mistake
me
dear
madam
said
he
struggling
for
words
to
reassure
her
it
was
not
scorn
it
was
grief
that
moved
me
to
speak
as
i
did
i
felt
your
words
dimly
as
an
outrage
on
the
modesty
of
womanhood
oh
forgive
me
i
do
not
know
how
to
express
myself
cried
he
feeling
himself
floundering
into
deeper
depths
with
every
effort
he
made
to
extricate
himself
you
express
yourself
only
too
clearly
she
cried
with
inexpressible
bitterness
i
see
that
my
fault
will
never
be
forgiven
or
forgotten
oh
indeed
it
will
cried
lance
eagerly
trying
to
condone
his
offensive
words
what
i
meant
to
say
was
this
i
felt
very
badly
over
your
words
at
first
but
since
i
have
seen
how
much
you
regret
your
rashness
i
have
ceased
to
consider
it
anything
but
a
momentary
indiscretion
which
i
trust
soon
to
wholly
forget
when
you
will
again
be
reinstated
in
my
whole
confidence
and
respect
oh
thank
you
thank
you
she
cried
chafing
at
the
coldness
of
his
words
but
trying
to
content
herself
since
she
could
extract
no
kinder
speech
from
him
believe
me
lance
i
will
try
to
merit
your
confidence
and
no
indiscretion
of
mine
shall
wound
you
again
and
we
will
drop
that
subject
forever
will
we
not
said
he
leading
her
up
the
hotel
steps
and
into
the
warm
lighted
parlor
forever
she
answered
with
a
quivering
sigh
he
drew
forward
a
chair
before
the
glowing
coal
fire
and
led
her
to
it
you
must
feel
tired
and
cold
after
your
long
walk
he
said
i
will
have
something
warm
sent
in
while
i
inquire
about
the
sleigh
he
went
away
and
directly
a
neat
entered
bearing
a
tray
of
warm
refreshments
vance
drank
some
coffee
but
had
no
appetite
for
the
viands
warm
and
delicious
as
they
appeared
so
the
maid
with
a
courtesy
took
the
tray
and
retired
she
waited
some
time
before
lance
returned
he
came
in
looking
pale
and
troubled
it
is
too
bad
he
said
in
a
tone
of
vexation
but
dabney
sleigh
which
i
counted
on
confidently
as
being
available
was
hired
out
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
to
a
couple
of
young
fellows
off
on
a
lark
into
the
country
they
will
not
return
until
evening
then
what
are
we
to
do
she
asked
the
young
fellow
smothered
some
sort
of
a
vexed
ejaculation
between
his
mustached
lips
we
are
to
be
patient
he
answered
grimly
dabney
knows
a
man
a
mile
away
from
here
who
keeps
a
sleigh
he
has
sent
off
on
the
mere
chance
of
its
being
at
home
to
secure
it
for
us
he
went
out
and
left
her
sitting
before
the
fire
gazing
into
the
glowing
coals
thoughtfully
after
he
had
gone
she
took
out
her
watch
and
looked
at
it
twelve
she
repeated
to
herself
putting
the
watch
quietly
back
lance
returned
after
an
hour
of
patient
waiting
accompanied
by
dabney
himself
we
have
been
very
unfortunate
indeed
in
being
unable
to
secure
you
a
conveyance
of
any
sort
madam
he
said
courteously
it
is
now
after
one
and
all
efforts
have
failed
would
it
please
you
to
retire
and
wait
until
morning
we
will
then
provide
comfortable
means
for
your
return
she
looked
at
lance
timidly
it
is
the
only
thing
to
be
done
he
answered
moodily
i
would
walk
to
the
city
myself
if
it
were
the
slightest
use
but
i
am
an
indifferent
walker
and
could
not
possibly
get
back
here
till
long
after
daylight
so
the
only
course
i
see
open
is
to
wait
for
a
sleigh
which
is
promised
me
in
the
morning
if
that
is
the
case
she
answered
sadly
i
should
be
glad
to
retire
i
am
very
tired
and
feel
the
shock
of
my
accident
painfully
the
gentlemen
retired
and
a
maid
came
in
and
showed
vance
to
a
sleeping
apartment
she
locked
the
door
and
threw
herself
wearily
across
the
bed
she
was
laboring
under
some
strong
excitement
no
sleep
refreshed
her
burning
eyelids
that
night
at
daylight
the
little
maid
knocked
at
the
door
with
a
tempting
breakfast
arranged
on
a
tray
the
sleigh
has
arrived
and
is
waiting
until
you
have
your
breakfast
said
she
politely
vance
bathed
her
face
and
hands
her
disordered
hair
and
after
doing
full
justice
to
the
tray
of
viands
descended
to
lance
who
impatiently
waited
her
coming
he
helped
her
into
the
sleigh
took
up
the
reins
and
set
off
homeward
i
hope
you
slept
well
he
remarked
to
break
the
awkward
silence
she
turned
her
dark
eyes
up
to
meet
his
questioning
glance
he
saw
with
surprise
they
were
hollow
languid
and
sleepless
while
a
glance
of
ineffable
anguish
shone
upon
him
could
i
sleep
well
do
you
think
she
inquired
in
a
voice
full
of
passionate
reproach
could
i
sleep
at
all
knowing
the
dreadful
fate
which
awaits
me
i
fail
to
understand
you
said
he
in
a
voice
of
perplexity
you
can
not
be
so
blind
lance
you
are
only
playing
with
me
she
murmured
sadly
pray
explain
yourself
he
answered
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
your
speech
and
manner
simply
mystify
me
what
dreadful
fate
awaits
you
mrs
vance
she
turned
upon
him
a
moment
with
flashing
eyes
then
looked
down
again
as
she
answered
in
low
intense
tones
do
you
not
understand
lance
what
my
pride
shrinks
from
telling
you
in
plain
terms
the
bitter
truth
that
my
stay
with
you
last
night
at
the
dabney
hotel
has
irretrievably
compromised
my
fair
fame
in
the
eyes
of
the
carping
and
censorious
world
she
paused
and
lancelot
darling
sat
still
and
motionless
like
one
stricken
with
paralysis
oh
that
is
impossible
he
said
at
last
no
one
knows
of
our
accident
all
new
york
will
know
it
she
said
bitterly
ill
news
flies
apace
the
finger
of
scorn
will
be
lifted
against
me
on
every
hand
perhaps
even
lawrence
will
turn
me
out
of
doors
the
reproach
and
passion
had
died
out
of
her
voice
it
was
full
of
pathetic
pity
for
her
own
sorrow
surely
it
can
not
be
as
bad
as
you
fear
said
lance
startled
and
troubled
alas
it
is
too
sadly
true
she
said
mournfully
what
can
i
do
to
remedy
your
trouble
he
inquired
his
native
chivalry
rising
to
the
surface
in
defense
of
the
woman
he
had
unwittingly
injured
what
a
man
do
in
such
cases
she
asked
in
a
low
and
meaning
tone
marry
i
suppose
he
said
after
a
long
hesitation
yes
she
answered
quietly
silence
fell
for
the
space
of
a
few
moments
lance
drove
on
mechanically
drawing
his
breath
hard
like
a
hunted
animal
he
roused
himself
at
last
and
spoke
in
a
cold
constrained
unnatural
tone
then
i
will
marry
you
vance
he
said
i
can
not
promise
to
love
you
nay
i
can
hardly
give
you
the
respect
i
would
think
the
natural
due
of
some
other
woman
but
since
i
have
injured
your
honor
i
will
give
you
the
shelter
of
my
name
thanks
a
thousand
thanks
she
murmured
chapter
xxxiii
shelton
did
not
think
it
expedient
to
communicate
to
lawrence
the
startling
fact
that
the
beloved
daughter
whom
he
mourned
as
dead
was
yet
numbered
among
the
living
he
had
not
the
heart
to
give
him
this
joyful
assurance
and
then
offset
it
by
the
statement
that
she
was
immured
somewhere
in
the
walls
of
a
prison
in
the
power
of
two
wicked
and
unscrupulous
men
he
determined
if
possible
to
trace
out
her
whereabouts
and
rescue
her
before
revealing
the
whole
truth
to
the
sorrowing
father
he
therefore
compromised
the
matter
by
telling
a
portion
only
of
the
truth
to
the
banker
namely
that
he
had
traced
the
body
of
the
young
girl
to
a
certain
house
in
the
suburbs
but
that
it
had
been
removed
thence
when
he
went
to
look
for
it
and
that
he
was
following
up
a
new
clew
which
he
confidently
hoped
would
soon
lead
to
its
recovery
he
also
added
the
fact
that
doctor
pratt
and
harold
colville
were
the
guilty
parties
in
the
matter
lawrence
was
anxious
at
first
to
have
these
two
men
arrested
and
forced
to
acknowledge
their
guilt
and
return
the
missing
body
but
he
yielded
to
shelton
contrary
persuasions
on
being
assured
that
such
a
proceeding
might
result
in
the
disastrous
failure
of
his
plan
for
though
we
might
imprison
them
lawrence
said
he
the
rigor
of
the
law
could
not
force
them
to
divulge
their
dreadful
secret
unless
they
chose
to
do
so
it
is
only
too
probable
that
they
would
maintain
the
most
obstinate
silence
on
the
subject
therefore
let
them
go
free
a
little
longer
and
let
us
oppose
cunning
to
cunning
and
fraud
to
fraud
until
we
attain
our
end
the
banker
acquiesced
and
the
detective
hurried
away
for
he
was
resolved
that
the
wily
schemers
should
not
elude
him
again
as
they
had
certainly
done
on
the
occasion
of
the
removal
of
lily
lawrence
from
the
leverets
house
once
more
he
and
his
faithful
colleague
took
up
their
task
of
espionage
but
it
was
unavailing
for
weeks
harold
colville
had
conceived
a
dim
suspicion
that
he
was
watched
and
was
therefore
doubly
vigilant
and
wary
for
more
than
a
month
he
did
not
visit
lily
but
contented
himself
by
receiving
cautious
bulletins
of
her
welfare
from
doctor
heath
weekly
the
messages
went
through
the
mails
and
were
directed
to
a
fictitious
address
in
these
careful
weeks
a
new
scheme
was
revolving
in
colville
brain
always
fertile
in
evil
he
was
growing
heartily
tired
and
impatient
at
lily
obstinacy
and
was
frightened
lest
some
unforeseen
accident
should
snatch
his
lovely
prize
from
him
he
began
to
realize
that
lily
would
never
yield
her
consent
to
become
his
wife
yet
he
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
never
give
her
up
he
determined
therefore
on
a
forced
marriage
what
do
you
think
of
it
said
he
to
his
familiar
pratt
after
detailing
his
fears
and
anxieties
to
that
worthy
and
stating
his
final
resolution
would
that
do
excellently
well
said
pratt
who
began
to
feel
as
anxious
as
colville
about
the
obstinacy
of
their
prisoner
it
is
the
best
thing
we
can
do
our
position
is
becoming
environed
with
difficulties
if
we
had
not
removed
her
from
leveret
just
in
the
nick
of
time
that
detective
shelton
who
found
the
bodies
of
haidee
and
peter
must
inevitably
have
discovered
her
and
ere
this
hour
we
must
both
have
seen
the
inside
of
a
prison
yes
it
would
be
infinitely
wiser
to
force
a
marriage
with
the
perverse
little
jade
and
carry
her
off
to
europe
if
need
be
seeing
herself
thus
irrevocably
bound
to
you
she
would
understand
that
her
only
hope
of
happiness
lay
in
reconciliation
and
she
would
act
accordingly
marry
it
shall
be
then
said
colville
with
a
brightening
face
but
when
and
by
whom
could
we
find
a
priest
who
would
read
the
ceremony
over
us
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
case
never
fear
for
that
said
pratt
laughing
i
can
find
you
a
priest
in
new
york
who
would
do
the
deed
without
any
twinges
of
conscience
for
a
pocket
full
of
money
leave
that
to
me
and
when
i
have
found
him
i
will
report
progress
and
you
shall
name
the
happy
day
it
will
be
a
speedy
bridal
if
i
am
allowed
to
usurp
the
lady
usual
prerogative
and
name
the
day
returned
colville
in
a
fine
humor
with
himself
at
the
near
prospect
of
his
union
with
the
beautiful
lily
it
will
be
better
to
allow
her
the
chance
of
doing
so
replied
pratt
sarcastically
ladies
are
great
sticklers
for
these
small
points
of
etiquette
you
know
after
we
have
settled
the
preliminaries
we
will
slip
out
there
some
dark
night
in
disguise
and
acquaint
her
with
the
good
fortune
in
store
for
her
and
give
her
a
chance
to
yield
gracefully
should
she
still
refuse
we
will
make
no
more
ado
about
it
but
take
the
priest
out
there
next
day
and
marry
the
beauty
it
is
settled
then
said
colville
and
i
shall
write
myself
the
happy
man
but
apropos
of
that
pratt
whom
do
you
imagine
the
chained
prisoner
found
at
leveret
could
be
i
had
no
idea
the
devils
were
carrying
on
such
a
double
game
nor
i
said
pratt
i
have
indulged
in
a
great
many
surmises
respecting
that
mysterious
prisoner
but
can
not
arrive
at
anything
satisfactory
have
you
fancied
it
might
be
inquired
colville
fearfully
while
drops
of
perspiration
broke
out
upon
his
brow
yes
i
have
fancied
it
might
be
she
answered
pratt
coolly
perhaps
old
peter
and
haidee
played
us
false
and
did
not
kill
her
as
you
desired
we
were
not
strict
enough
with
them
we
should
have
demanded
a
sight
of
the
body
for
our
assurance
where
is
the
woman
they
found
asked
colville
i
have
tried
to
learn
her
whereabouts
diligently
said
doctor
pratt
but
only
ended
by
asking
myself
the
same
question
you
asked
now
it
is
rather
strange
too
i
should
have
thought
there
would
be
no
difficulty
but
there
seems
to
be
a
mystery
connected
with
her
removal
if
i
could
find
her
and
it
prove
to
be
fanny
i
would
kill
her
muttered
colville
with
a
fearful
oath
perhaps
she
is
dead
already
replied
the
physician
the
papers
described
her
as
being
too
far
gone
to
give
her
name
or
any
evidence
regarding
herself
probably
she
has
succumbed
to
her
great
weakness
and
died
i
hope
so
replied
the
other
for
i
have
felt
horribly
afraid
that
she
might
prove
to
be
fanny
the
killing
of
those
two
wretches
was
a
most
mysterious
affair
remarked
pratt
musingly
have
you
any
suspicion
as
to
the
perpetrator
asked
harold
colville
not
the
slightest
it
is
a
most
mysterious
affair
to
me
the
wildest
conjecture
fails
to
fathom
it
whoever
the
mysterious
poisoner
may
be
he
has
my
sincere
thanks
and
best
wishes
said
harold
colville
sardonically
i
owed
the
wretches
a
grudge
for
their
attempt
on
lily
life
yes
their
death
is
eminently
satisfactory
to
me
remarked
pratt
i
was
casting
about
in
my
mind
for
some
safe
way
to
punish
their
perfidy
without
getting
into
trouble
myself
when
this
opportune
accident
to
their
health
stepped
in
between
me
and
my
meditated
revenge
a
pious
person
might
almost
call
it
an
intervention
of
providence
i
dare
say
we
should
have
called
it
an
intervention
of
the
devil
if
we
had
not
been
fortunate
enough
to
carry
my
lady
off
safely
the
night
before
it
happened
laughed
colville
after
all
their
plot
to
kill
her
was
rather
fortunate
since
we
came
in
just
in
time
to
frustrate
it
answered
pratt
for
if
they
had
not
conspired
against
her
life
we
should
not
have
thought
of
removing
her
that
night
and
she
must
have
fallen
into
the
detective
hands
on
the
ensuing
day
the
devil
takes
care
of
his
own
i
am
certain
his
satanic
majesty
helped
us
in
that
affair
was
the
laughing
reply
the
two
villains
continued
to
indulge
in
these
pleasing
retrospections
of
the
past
for
some
minutes
then
separated
the
physician
going
off
on
his
medical
duties
and
the
man
about
town
to
some
of
his
familiar
haunts
of
dissipation
as
they
emerged
from
the
hotel
each
man
unconsciously
to
himself
was
followed
by
another
man
who
stole
forth
from
the
corridors
of
the
building
one
of
those
men
the
same
who
now
followed
pratt
had
been
outside
of
colville
door
with
his
ear
glued
to
the
keyhole
during
the
progress
of
their
interesting
conversation
it
was
shelton
the
detective
how
little
the
two
conspirators
dreamed
of
what
ears
had
listened
to
their
nefarious
schemes
of
forcing
their
victim
into
a
loathsome
marriage
by
the
aid
of
some
priest
who
disgraced
the
holy
robe
he
wore
by
such
sacrilege
fate
was
weaving
her
web
silently
but
rapidly
around
the
two
wicked
plotters
and
ere
long
they
would
receive
their
reward
shelton
had
learned
several
facts
unknown
to
him
before
while
listening
to
that
private
conversation
he
resumed
his
weary
task
of
espionage
infused
with
new
hope
and
courage
feeling
within
himself
the
consciousness
that
he
must
and
would
succeed

through
his
fault
or
accident
he
therefore
fell
an
easy
victim
to
her
artful
wiles
and
prepared
to
sacrifice
himself
on
the
altar
of
her
imperious
will
while
deploring
with
all
the
passion
of
his
manly
nature
the
cause
that
demanded
it
i
thought
myself
the
most
miserable
of
all
men
on
earth
before
this
happened
said
he
to
lawrence
after
confiding
to
him
his
unhappy
position
life
has
held
nothing
but
despair
for
me
since
lily
died
but
now
that
i
must
take
to
my
heart
in
place
of
my
worshiped
darling
this
mature
woman
with
her
bold
beauty
and
coquettish
arts
i
feel
myself
if
possible
driven
nearer
than
before
to
the
verge
of
madness
i
believe
you
are
sacrificing
yourself
unnecessarily
my
boy
said
the
banker
warmly
for
he
saw
through
the
widow
arts
directly
and
lamented
the
chivalrous
nature
that
made
lance
become
her
prey
easily
i
believe
vance
in
order
to
secure
a
rich
husband
has
represented
matters
in
a
much
stronger
light
than
truth
would
sanction
your
unfortunate
accident
is
unknown
save
to
a
few
and
by
a
timely
whisper
to
those
who
are
cognizant
of
it
it
need
never
transpire
to
the
world
and
even
if
it
should
there
is
no
harm
in
it
it
would
be
impossible
to
convince
vance
of
that
said
lance
with
a
heavy
sigh
because
she
does
not
desire
to
be
convinced
of
it
said
the
banker
grimly
in
her
eagerness
to
secure
you
she
will
make
the
most
of
her
small
capital
that
she
may
delude
you
into
becoming
her
husband
lance
felt
that
lawrence
spoke
the
truth
but
he
was
too
modest
and
honorable
to
tell
his
friend
of
the
previous
attempt
of
the
wily
widow
to
secure
him
by
her
bold
declaration
of
love
he
felt
that
he
had
gotten
into
her
toils
and
that
she
would
never
allow
him
to
extricate
himself
so
he
answered
sadly
enough
be
that
as
it
may
i
have
given
her
my
word
to
make
her
my
wife
and
i
can
not
now
withdraw
from
it
you
would
if
you
were
of
my
mind
though
said
his
friend
you
are
at
least
ten
years
younger
than
she
is
lance
and
the
match
is
totally
unsuitable
take
my
advice
and
withdraw
from
it
make
over
to
her
a
sum
of
money
perhaps
that
would
heal
her
wounded
honor
i
do
not
think
she
would
release
me
on
any
terms
were
i
brave
enough
to
propose
it
said
lance
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
added
with
a
blush
i
actually
believe
that
the
woman
really
loves
me
lawrence
laughed
at
the
blush
and
the
assertion
perhaps
she
does
he
admitted
i
suppose
that
would
not
be
difficult
for
her
to
do
women
run
mad
over
handsome
faces
you
know
but
seriously
lance
jesting
aside
i
would
be
off
with
the
whole
thing
if
you
loved
her
it
would
be
different
she
is
handsome
enough
to
grace
your
home
and
queen
it
royally
there
but
to
burden
yourself
with
an
unloved
wife
will
be
like
hanging
a
about
your
neck
i
wish
i
could
take
your
advice
sir
said
lance
but
i
think
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
get
loose
from
vance
she
is
quite
determined
to
write
her
name
mrs
darling
how
soon
does
she
propose
to
immolate
her
victim
on
the
altar
of
sacrifice
inquired
the
banker
grimly
at
a
very
early
day
answered
the
young
man
the
of
december
is
her
choice
shameful
ejaculated
the
banker
she
is
determined
to
push
her
power
to
the
utmost
and
you
permitted
it
naming
the
day
is
the
lady
prerogative
you
know
sir
said
lance
bitterly
i
confess
i
did
hint
for
a
rather
longer
extension
of
my
bachelor
freedom
but
she
asserted
that
the
peculiar
circumstances
attending
our
engagement
would
not
admit
of
farther
delay
she
was
afraid
you
might
possibly
escape
her
toils
if
you
were
afforded
a
longer
time
in
which
to
reflect
on
your
position
asserted
lawrence
well
lance
if
you
are
determined
to
sacrifice
yourself
for
a
scruple
of
overstrained
chivalry
i
need
not
urge
you
further
it
would
be
useless
i
am
tempted
to
drive
the
deceitful
jade
forth
from
the
shelter
of
my
roof
within
the
hour
oh
pray
do
not
said
lance
earnestly
it
would
only
precipitate
the
evil
day
of
our
union
she
would
claim
my
protection
immediately
then
it
is
very
probable
she
would
for
your
sake
then
lance
i
will
let
her
remain
and
even
allow
her
marriage
to
take
place
in
my
house
but
i
can
never
like
or
respect
her
again
even
as
your
wife
i
will
leave
you
to
make
the
truth
known
to
ada
continued
lancelot
bitterly
do
not
allow
her
to
believe
that
i
am
faithless
to
precious
memory
mr
lawrence
i
will
tell
her
the
whole
truth
answered
lawrence
deeply
moved
lance
went
away
and
lawrence
hastened
to
communicate
the
astonishing
news
to
ada
who
was
confined
to
her
sofa
with
her
sprained
ankle
papa
i
am
not
so
surprised
as
you
expect
me
to
be
said
the
young
girl
frankly
i
have
long
seen
that
vance
was
using
every
art
in
her
power
to
win
poor
lance
indeed
i
incurred
her
everlasting
displeasure
some
time
ago
by
boldly
charging
her
with
it
she
did
not
deny
it
but
retaliated
by
saying
that
i
wanted
him
myself
she
seized
upon
the
occurrence
of
last
night
as
a
pretext
for
winning
what
she
has
long
been
angling
for
the
hand
of
our
poor
unhappy
lance
he
will
live
to
repent
his
boyish
notion
of
chivalry
i
am
sure
he
added
changing
the
subject
abruptly
i
called
on
young
philip
john
and
thanked
him
for
his
friendliness
to
you
last
night
and
invited
him
to
dinner
i
had
to
show
him
some
attention
you
know
he
said
observing
the
flush
that
colored
ada
cheek
so
suddenly
you
do
not
object
i
hope
oh
no
no
she
murmured
he
was
exceedingly
kind
he
is
a
very
superior
young
man
said
the
banker
cordially
well
born
wealthy
and
a
lawyer
by
profession
he
is
a
particular
friend
of
lance
which
in
itself
is
a
recommendation
to
any
young
man
continued
lawrence
in
whose
eyes
lancelot
darling
appeared
the
of
human
perfection
if
vance
had
expected
to
be
congratulated
by
the
banker
and
his
daughter
upon
her
approaching
marriage
she
was
doomed
to
disappointment
neither
one
of
them
alluded
to
it
at
all
though
she
knew
that
lance
had
told
them
and
that
they
resented
her
conduct
bitterly
by
the
cold
and
altered
manner
almost
amounting
to
contempt
with
which
they
treated
her
she
was
obliged
to
broach
the
matter
to
lawrence
herself
coupled
with
a
modest
request
for
the
funds
wherewith
to
purchase
as
elaborate
a
as
could
be
gotten
in
the
short
time
intervening
between
then
and
christmas
lawrence
in
the
grimmest
and
coldest
manner
imaginable
presented
her
with
a
check
for
a
thousand
dollars
and
with
profuse
thanks
she
hurried
out
to
expend
it
in
finery
she
was
very
happy
now
in
the
coming
fulfillment
of
her
cherished
desire
and
no
coldness
not
even
the
lowering
shadow
on
lance
face
when
he
came
and
went
had
power
to
alter
her
imperious
will
to
win
him
she
had
steeped
her
hands
in
human
blood
and
risked
the
dangers
of
the
scaffold
it
was
not
likely
she
would
relent
now
when
the
sin
and
sorrow
lay
behind
her
in
the
past
and
the
happy
consummation
of
all
her
efforts
loomed
brightly
before
her
she
went
on
blithely
with
her
task
of
preparation
for
the
grand
event
seeing
dressmakers
and
milliners
daily
and
leaving
herself
no
time
for
retrospection
in
her
whirl
of
engagements
and
time
that
waits
for
no
man
hurried
on
and
brought
the
day
of
fate
chapter
xxxv
slowly
and
wearily
passed
the
days
to
the
poor
captive
girl
immured
in
the
midst
of
doctor
heath
insane
patients
she
was
kept
closely
confined
to
her
room
seeing
no
one
at
all
except
the
attendant
mary
brown
and
occasionally
doctor
heath
both
these
persons
in
spite
of
her
agonized
assertions
and
explanations
persisted
in
regarding
her
as
a
lunatic
immured
in
a
madhouse
startled
and
frightened
daily
by
the
insane
shrieks
of
the
mad
people
about
her
and
regarded
as
insane
herself
lily
heart
sank
within
her
and
she
began
to
fear
that
her
mind
would
indeed
give
way
under
her
trials
and
she
would
become
in
reality
the
melancholy
maniac
they
pretended
to
believe
her
but
she
had
at
least
one
comfort
in
the
midst
of
her
troubles
she
had
been
spared
for
nearly
two
months
the
odious
visits
of
harold
colville
and
his
confederate
doctor
pratt
she
could
not
conjecture
why
she
had
been
thus
highly
favored
but
congratulated
herself
all
the
same
upon
the
fact
if
she
had
known
the
real
truth
of
the
matter
that
they
believed
themselves
watched
and
were
afraid
to
venture
near
her
she
would
have
felt
her
heart
leap
with
new
hope
at
the
knowledge
but
her
long
imprisonment
and
many
trials
had
worn
out
hope
in
her
breast
she
believed
that
death
was
the
only
friend
that
would
intervene
to
save
her
from
harold
colville
she
sat
sadly
musing
before
her
fire
one
night
when
the
loud
ringing
of
the
bell
below
startled
her
from
her
dreaming
and
the
thought
that
she
was
about
to
receive
a
visit
from
her
captors
darted
into
her
mind
ten
minutes
elapsed
and
she
began
to
feel
relieved
and
believe
herself
mistaken
when
footsteps
were
heard
upon
the
stairs
and
presently
the
two
wretches
entered
her
room
they
had
remained
below
long
enough
to
remove
their
disguises
without
which
they
had
been
afraid
to
visit
her
they
would
not
have
felt
so
secure
if
they
had
known
that
the
detective
shelton
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
laughing
in
his
sleeve
at
the
ineffectual
trouble
they
had
taken
in
disguising
themselves
shelton
had
seen
this
house
before
knew
that
it
was
a
madhouse
was
acquainted
with
the
name
of
the
proprietor
and
knew
also
that
he
was
suspected
at
the
police
headquarters
of
being
engaged
in
a
fraudulent
business
and
that
a
descent
upon
the
house
for
the
purpose
of
verifying
suspicion
was
meditated
ah
miss
lawrence
said
doctor
pratt
airily
i
trust
you
find
yourself
in
better
health
and
spirits
than
when
we
last
met
lily
turned
her
head
away
without
replying
while
colville
bending
over
her
whispered
gallantly
ah
my
obdurate
fair
one
have
you
relented
yet
no
answered
lily
briefly
and
coldly
withdrawing
the
hand
he
had
tried
to
take
in
his
own
i
hoped
your
mind
had
changed
in
the
long
interval
since
we
last
met
said
he
taking
a
seat
near
her
doctor
pratt
had
already
taken
a
chair
by
the
grated
window
you
were
mistaken
she
answered
coldly
as
before
i
think
you
will
admit
that
i
have
waited
long
and
patiently
on
your
pleasure
lily
said
he
in
a
tone
of
expostulation
lily
lifted
her
large
blue
eyes
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
him
with
a
glance
in
which
contempt
and
weariness
were
blended
colville
she
said
quietly
pray
spare
yourself
the
useless
discussion
of
that
subject
you
had
my
answer
long
ago
i
assure
you
my
decision
is
unalterable
but
lily
reflect
a
moment
would
not
a
union
with
me
be
preferable
to
a
lifetime
of
isolation
and
weariness
here
no
she
answered
steadily
even
the
wretched
existence
i
drag
out
here
among
the
insane
inhabitants
of
this
place
is
far
more
welcome
to
me
than
the
hated
thought
of
a
union
with
you
i
am
sorry
you
think
so
he
answered
in
tones
of
bitter
sarcasm
as
unfortunately
i
do
not
propose
to
give
you
any
choice
in
the
matter
what
do
you
mean
she
inquired
with
a
thrill
of
indefinable
fear
creeping
coldly
around
her
heart
he
saw
the
look
of
terror
that
came
into
her
eyes
and
villain
though
he
was
he
hesitated
before
speaking
out
what
was
in
his
mind
he
glanced
at
pratt
and
took
courage
from
the
gleam
of
that
eyes
i
mean
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
of
concentrated
rage
and
bitterness
that
your
obstinacy
has
at
length
worn
out
my
patience
and
i
have
determined
to
take
my
own
way
in
the
matter
regardless
of
your
will
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
in
a
quivering
voice
while
her
young
face
blanched
to
a
deathly
hue
i
am
going
to
make
you
my
wife
without
your
consent
he
answered
grimly
you
can
not
she
answered
with
dilating
eyes
and
a
trembling
voice
it
would
be
no
marriage
if
i
refused
to
consent
so
much
the
worse
for
you
then
he
answered
laughing
harshly
for
the
marriage
ceremony
shall
certainly
be
read
over
us
and
that
will
be
entirely
sufficient
for
me
i
shall
surely
consider
you
my
wife
then
and
take
you
to
my
heart
without
further
scruples
no
holy
man
of
god
would
perform
such
an
unhallowed
ceremony
said
she
incredulously
do
not
delude
yourself
thus
my
sweet
girl
he
laughed
mockingly
a
priest
is
already
engaged
for
the
important
occasion
will
you
be
pleased
to
appoint
the
happy
day
never
she
flashed
out
bitterly
you
force
me
then
to
usurp
your
feminine
privilege
he
answered
coolly
and
in
that
case
your
womanly
vanity
can
of
course
pardon
the
impatient
ardor
of
a
lover
who
has
waited
humbly
and
patiently
as
i
have
done
then
shall
witness
our
bridal
she
cried
springing
up
and
clasping
her
small
hands
together
in
helpless
agony
oh
no
you
do
not
mean
it
you
will
not
be
so
cruel
you
will
see
he
answered
i
have
made
every
preparation
for
the
event
even
to
our
bridal
tour
a
steamer
leaves
her
wharf
for
europe
i
have
secured
our
passage
and
this
morning
sent
aboard
of
her
a
trunk
well
filled
with
feminine
apparel
for
your
use
during
the
voyage
of
course
you
will
select
your
bridal
after
we
arrive
at
paris
i
shall
not
deny
my
beautiful
bride
any
luxury
it
only
remains
for
me
to
inform
you
that
i
will
bring
a
priest
out
here
and
our
marriage
shall
be
duly
celebrated
before
we
take
passage
for
the
old
world
lily
remained
standing
gazing
at
the
scheming
villain
with
dilated
blue
eyes
and
lips
and
cheeks
blanched
to
the
pallid
whiteness
of
death
harold
colville
laughed
mockingly
you
may
stare
fair
one
he
said
shall
see
you
my
wife
no
power
can
save
you
no
power
she
repeated
gazing
at
him
with
flashing
eyes
no
power
oh
blasphemer
do
you
forget
that
there
is
a
god
above
who
cares
for
the
innocent
and
punishes
the
guilty
beware
lest
his
vengeance
fall
upon
you
in
the
hour
of
your
fancied
triumph
she
looked
like
some
beautiful
inspired
prophetess
as
she
faced
him
with
a
lifted
hand
that
seemed
to
menace
him
with
evil
her
golden
hair
had
become
loosened
from
its
fastenings
and
streamed
over
her
shoulders
gleaming
around
her
lovely
pallid
features
like
a
halo
of
light
for
a
moment
harold
colville
quailed
before
her
with
something
like
fear
of
that
dread
tribunal
with
whose
vengeance
she
threatened
him
his
heart
sank
strangely
within
him
while
hers
for
the
moment
thrilled
with
a
presentiment
of
coming
deliverance
surely
if
coming
events
cast
their
shadows
before
both
the
guilty
harold
colville
and
the
wronged
lily
lawrence
were
gifted
with
a
momentary
prescience
of
that
which
was
hastening
to
them
in
the
near
future
doctor
pratt
saw
the
subtle
shadow
settling
over
colville
pale
features
and
arose
hastily
come
come
miss
lawrence
he
said
harshly
these
tragedy
airs
would
be
very
fine
on
the
stage
but
they
are
out
of
place
here
spare
yourself
so
much
unnecessary
exertion
you
will
most
certainly
become
colville
wife
instead
of
this
useless
defiance
let
me
advise
you
to
cultivate
a
spirit
of
meekness
and
submission
it
is
useless
to
threaten
us
with
the
punishment
of
god
we
do
not
believe
in
him
she
was
walking
restlessly
up
and
down
the
floor
and
made
him
no
answer
save
one
scathing
flash
from
her
brilliant
eyes
he
turned
away
with
a
laugh
of
derision
come
colville
let
us
go
he
said
other
matters
demand
our
attention
now
we
must
arrange
matters
with
heath
before
we
go
colville
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
at
the
young
girl
restlessly
pacing
the
floor
then
my
fair
and
obdurate
love
said
he
until
then
adieu
no
word
or
motion
betrayed
that
she
heard
him
he
closed
and
locked
the
door
going
away
with
the
exultant
thought
that
this
was
his
last
parting
from
his
beautiful
captive
she
heard
the
sound
of
the
receding
footsteps
and
fell
on
her
knees
lifting
up
her
convulsed
face
in
a
passionate
appeal
to
god
that
he
would
deliver
her
from
the
snares
of
these
wicked
men
they
went
and
were
closeted
some
time
with
doctor
heath
when
they
went
away
a
large
roll
of
bills
was
passed
from
the
purse
of
harold
colville
to
the
pocket
of
the
complacent
little
then
resuming
their
disguises
they
took
leave
then
said
colville
as
they
descended
the
steps
speaking
thoughtlessly
aloud
we
shall
return
and
with
the
worthy
priest
assistance
i
shall
bear
away
my
unwilling
bride
hush
do
not
speak
so
loud
said
doctor
pratt
cautiously
the
very
stones
have
ears
they
sprang
into
their
carriage
and
drove
rapidly
away
then
a
dark
form
that
had
been
crouching
beneath
the
steps
came
out
and
straightened
its
cramped
limbs
he
repeated
with
a
low
exultant
laugh
ah
what
a
happy
day
will
be
to
some
sorrowing
hearts
that
i
know
of
take
courage
sweet
lily
lawrence

to
the
arms
of

father
and
your
lover
let
me
see
is
the
of
december
what
a
triumphant
christmas
eve
it
will
be
for
me
he
walked
on
some
distance
to
where
he
had
secured
his
horse
and
mounting
him
in
haste
rode
away
full
of
plans
for
his
next
day
happy
mission
to
sorrowing
hearts
chapter
xxxvi
it
was
the
of
december
and
lawrence
sat
alone
in
his
elegant
office
at
the
bank
musing
sadly
before
the
glowing
fire
in
the
grate
the
banker
looked
worn
and
sad
and
now
and
then
a
heavy
sigh
parted
his
lips
and
a
dimness
crept
over
his
fine
blue
eyes
he
was
thinking
of
his
beautiful
elder
daughter
whose
tragic
death
had
broken
his
fatherly
heart
he
brushed
his
handkerchief
across
his
eyes
and
sighed
heavily
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
clerk
entered
with
card
ah
said
lawrence
show
the
gentleman
in
mr
styles
shelton
entered
with
suppressed
excitement
beaming
from
every
feature
his
greeting
ceremonies
were
brief
and
hurried
lawrence
he
said
directly
i
have
a
carriage
in
waiting
outside
will
you
do
me
the
honor
to
ride
several
miles
with
me
this
morning
you
have
made
some
important
discovery
exclaimed
lawrence
rising
excitedly
yes
answered
the
detective
but
i
can
not
explain
until
we
are
on
our
way
we
have
not
a
minute
to
spare
they
hurried
out
and
took
their
places
in
the
carriage
driver
you
have
your
directions
said
the
detective
to
the
man
on
the
box
do
not
forget
drive
fast
and
overtake
the
other
carriage
if
possible
if
not
try
and
get
within
sight
of
it
at
least
is
there
another
carriage
inquired
the
banker
bewildered
yes
said
shelton
i
have
sent
a
carriage
ahead
of
us
containing
four
policemen
and
they
are
secretly
following
another
carriage
the
first
carriage
contains
doctor
pratt
harold
colville
and
a
priest
they
are
on
the
way
to
the
place
where
the
body
of
your
daughter
is
concealed
and
we
are
on
our
way
to
secure
and
arrest
them
you
are
perfectly
certain
i
hope
said
lawrence
trembling
with
excitement
yes
success
is
assured
said
shelton
with
a
ring
of
triumph
in
his
clear
tone
thank
god
exclaimed
the
banker
fervently
at
last
my
poor
desecrated
corpse
may
rest
in
a
fitting
sanctuary
he
leaned
over
and
wrung
the
detective
hand
gratefully
god
bless
you
my
friend
for
the
patience
and
perseverance
that
have
brought
this
result
at
last
he
said
the
detective
was
deeply
moved
by
the
emotion
of
the
elder
man
lawrence
said
he
bending
forward
and
speaking
in
low
impressive
tones
prepare
yourself
for
a
wonderful
revelation
are
you
strong
enough
to
bear
tidings
of
great
joy
what
do
you
mean
mr
shelton
inquired
the
banker
with
a
start
alas
what
joyful
tidings
can
come
to
me
as
i
am
at
the
loss
of
my
daughter
the
detective
leaned
forward
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
banker
arm
lawrence
he
said
in
a
voice
that
vibrated
with
feeling
it
is
not
the
corpse
of
your
daughter
that
i
am
about
to
restore
to
the
desecrated
vault
but
the
beautiful
lily
that
will
be
given
back
to
your
heart
and
your
home
lawrence
fell
back
against
the
cushion
of
the
carriage
like
one
stricken
with
death
so
great
was
the
shock
of
the
revelation
shelton
took
a
small
flask
from
his
pocket
and
forced
some
wine
between
his
white
and
gasping
lips
i
feared
these
joyful
tidings
would
unnerve
you
said
he
gently
calm
yourself
my
dear
sir
your
daughter
whom
you
have
mourned
as
dead
yet
lives
it
was
her
own
living
self
that
you
saw
in
your
hall
that
night
not
her
spirit
oh
god
be
thanked
lily
lives
repeated
the
banker
in
a
low
voice
of
ecstasy
shelton
put
his
head
out
of
the
carriage
window
a
moment
we
have
caught
up
with
the
officers
hack
said
he
now
we
are
all
right
driver
just
keep
on
at
your
present
pace
we
do
not
need
to
go
faster
every
moment
seems
an
hour
exclaimed
the
banker
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
and
impatience
oh
to
think
that
my
darling
lives
and
yet
oh
god
what
would
be
her
feelings
on
learning
that
her
betrothed
will
wed
another
do
not
distress
yourself
about
that
marriage
lawrence
answered
the
detective
i
assure
you
it
shall
never
be
consummated
ah
you
think
she
will
generously
yield
him
to
lily
when
she
finds
that
she
is
still
living
said
the
banker
but
you
do
not
know
vance
nothing
would
induce
her
to
release
her
victim
from
the
toils
she
has
wound
about
him
perhaps
i
know
more
of
vance
than
you
suppose
said
shelton
for
instance
lawrence
you
believe
that
your
daughter
committed
suicide
do
you
not
it
was
the
jury
verdict
said
the
banker
lawrence
your
daughter
was
as
happy
and
as
much
in
love
with
life
as
you
believed
her
to
be
she
never
attempted
to
commit
suicide
said
the
detective
firmly
she
did
not
then
who
what
began
the
banker
in
a
maze
of
bewilderment
the
dagger
that
pierced
her
innocent
breast
was
driven
home
by
the
murderous
hand
of
mrs
vance
was
the
reply
fear
horror
and
amazement
were
blended
on
the
pale
excited
features
of
the
listener
his
gray
head
fell
back
against
the
cushions
of
the
carriage
and
he
struggled
helplessly
for
speech
in
which
to
express
his
feelings
shelton
again
had
recourse
to
his
convenient
flask
of
wine
i
fear
i
am
exciting
you
too
much
with
my
astonishing
revelations
said
the
detective
kindly
i
do
not
wonder
at
your
emotion
for
my
own
agitation
at
learning
these
facts
was
great
how
much
more
poignant
must
your
feelings
be
than
mine
were
under
the
circumstances
that
affect
you
so
closely
the
viper
the
serpent
that
stung
the
hand
that
warmed
and
fed
her
exclaimed
the
banker
bitterly
you
may
well
say
so
said
shelton
she
has
indeed
proved
herself
a
monster
of
ingratitude
but
she
will
find
herself
foiled
and
ruined
she
has
but
a
few
hours
remaining
to
her
now
of
her
fancied
security
and
happiness
god
be
thanked
said
the
banker
and
oh
shelton
are
we
almost
there
the
time
seems
so
long
forgive
a
father
impatience
but
you
can
not
imagine
what
suspense
i
suffer
what
longings
overwhelm
me
at
the
thought
that
i
shall
soon
clasp
my
darling
lily
to
my
heart
again
we
shall
soon
be
there
now
patience
my
friend
said
the
detective
believe
me
i
sympathize
in
your
impatience
to
behold
your
daughter
again
you
are
a
noble
fellow
shelton
said
the
banker
you
will
not
find
me
ungrateful
the
carriage
slackened
its
pace
and
shelton
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
we
are
there
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
that
trembled
with
excitement
and
triumph
while
his
manly
handsome
features
beamed
with
joy
the
carriage
stopped
and
shelton
descended
followed
by
the
banker
who
trembled
so
that
he
could
scarcely
stand
upon
the
ground
the
four
officers
had
already
descended
from
their
vehicle
and
stood
respectfully
awaiting
shelton
approach
the
empty
carriage
of
pratt
and
colville
stood
in
waiting
before
the
door
at
a
word
from
shelton
they
all
ascended
the
steps
and
the
detective
rang
a
furious
peal
upon
the
bell
the
summons
was
unanswered
shelton
rang
again
and
again
with
a
like
result
what
will
you
do
now
asked
lawrence
in
a
perfect
fever
of
dread
and
impatience
burst
in
the
door
said
the
detective
in
a
ringing
voice
at
the
word
the
four
officers
fell
to
furiously
with
their
clubs
upon
the
door
a
few
moments
of
their
impetuous
battering
sufficed
to
burst
it
in
and
they
all
bounded
tumultuously
into
the
hall
a
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairway
looking
frightened
and
indignant
it
was
none
other
than
mary
brown
woman
said
shelton
imperiously
lead
the
way
to
miss
room
immediately
it
against
orders
sir
said
mary
sullenly
no
matter
do
as
i
bid
you
thundered
the
impatient
detective
miss
lawrence
has
company
sir
and
the
orders
are
not
to
admit
any
one
push
her
aside
men
we
will
hunt
for
miss
lawrence
ourselves
said
the
detective
sternly
strong
hands
forced
mary
aside
from
her
position
on
the
stairway
several
domestics
attracted
by
the
noise
had
hastened
up
from
the
regions
of
the
basement
and
stood
staring
stupidly
but
did
not
offer
any
resistance
to
the
officers
power
the
men
began
to
mount
the
stairs
rapidly
and
mary
brown
rushed
frantically
after
them
oh
for
the
lord
sake
gentlemen
she
panted
do
burst
in
the
doors
and
let
the
poor
crazy
people
out
upon
us
they
will
murder
us
all
will
you
do
as
we
told
you
then
asked
the
detective
sharply
oh
yes
yes
whimpered
mary
running
along
in
front
of
them
this
way
gentlemen
she
stopped
at
length
and
indicated
the
door
it
was
locked
but
the
officers
clubs
demolished
it
directly
and
not
a
moment
too
soon
were
they
for
what
was
progressing
within
that
room
the
villanous
priest
who
was
desecrating
his
holy
office
by
this
sacrilege
stood
in
the
center
of
the
floor
with
his
open
at
the
marriage
service
from
which
he
was
slowly
reading
colville
stood
in
front
of
him
and
the
united
efforts
of
the
worthy
doctors
pratt
and
heath
were
employed
in
holding
up
the
form
of
lily
lawrence
beside
him
with
a
scream
of
horror
lawrence
rushed
forward
and
snatching
his
daughter
from
their
villanous
hold
he
folded
her
tightly
to
his
heart
she
looked
up
an
instant
with
a
wild
and
piercing
shriek
and
seeing
the
beloved
face
of
her
father
dropped
unconscious
in
his
loving
arms
chapter
xxxvii
harold
colville
doctor
pratt
and
doctor
heath
you
are
under
arrest
cried
the
detective
in
a
ringing
voice
that
fell
on
the
ears
of
the
villanous
trio
like
the
trump
of
doom
officers
secure
your
men
there
was
a
brief
struggle
accompanied
by
loud
cries
and
oaths
then
the
superior
power
of
the
policemen
triumphed
and
each
man
had
his
prisoner
handcuffed
and
reduced
to
grim
silence
the
fourth
officer
had
collared
the
fat
little
priest
who
was
struggling
in
his
grasp
in
the
meantime
lawrence
had
been
vainly
striving
to
restore
the
consciousness
of
his
fainting
daughter
he
had
laid
her
upon
the
bed
and
was
wildly
chafing
her
cold
hands
while
he
called
her
by
every
term
of
love
his
fond
affection
could
devise
here
woman
said
shelton
to
mary
brown
who
lingered
in
the
hall
looking
in
at
the
scene
come
and
lend
a
hand
in
reviving
the
young
lady
she
has
fainted
mary
hurried
in
with
alacrity
and
lily
was
soon
restored
to
partial
consciousness
to
the
great
delight
of
her
father
she
lay
quite
still
with
eyes
contemplating
the
banker
face
with
an
expression
of
languid
ecstasy
though
she
trembled
excessively
i
must
get
my
prisoners
away
at
once
said
shelton
do
you
think
you
are
strong
enough
to
return
to
the
city
with
us
now
miss
lawrence
she
looked
up
in
languid
inquiry
at
the
strange
yet
kindly
voice
addressing
her
so
respectfully
and
made
an
effort
to
rise
but
fell
backward
wearily
doctor
pratt
turned
about
sullenly
in
my
character
of
a
physician
said
he
shortly
i
would
advise
you
not
to
remove
the
young
lady
for
several
hours
she
needs
complete
rest
for
a
little
while
to
recover
from
the
shock
she
has
sustained
you
can
take
my
advice
or
not
as
it
pleases
you
shelton
looked
at
the
banker
he
in
turn
looked
inquiringly
at
the
pale
face
of
his
daughter
she
answered
in
feeble
tones
perhaps
he
is
right
i
feel
completely
exhausted
now
allow
me
an
interval
of
rest
and
then
oh
how
gladly
i
will
leave
this
place
with
you
dear
papa
i
will
take
these
men
into
the
city
then
said
the
detective
and
return
for
you
lawrence
as
we
intend
to
search
the
house
thoroughly
it
is
strongly
suspected
that
some
persons
as
sane
as
you
or
i
are
confined
here
through
the
wickedness
of
their
relatives
and
the
connivance
of
this
man
heath
i
will
leave
two
officers
on
guard
here
while
i
am
away
he
went
out
followed
by
the
officers
with
their
prisoners
mary
brown
followed
after
and
the
banker
was
left
alone
with
the
daughter
who
had
been
so
strangely
restored
to
him
after
he
had
mourned
her
as
dead
for
many
months
he
bent
down
and
clasped
her
in
his
arms
and
his
joyful
tears
rained
upon
her
sweet
white
face
a
smile
of
heavenly
sweetness
beamed
on
her
pale
face
she
lay
still
a
little
while
nestling
against
her
father
breast
trying
to
picture
to
herself
the
ineffable
sweetness
of
the
that
awaited
her
she
pictured
to
herself
the
happiness
that
would
shine
in
the
dark
eyes
of
her
lover
when
she
came
back
to
him
as
one
from
the
dead
her
heart
began
to
beat
tumultuously
and
a
tinge
of
color
crept
into
her
wasted
cheeks
she
closed
her
eyes
to
shut
out
the
hateful
sight
of
her
prison
walls
and
fancied
herself
at
home
with
the
loved
ones
instead
in
the
meantime
lawrence
was
gazing
sadly
on
her
pale
and
wasted
features
marking
the
mournful
ravages
privation
and
sorrow
had
worked
in
that
once
blooming
face
my
lily
he
said
in
a
tone
of
anguish
taking
up
one
delicate
hand
and
looking
at
the
blue
veins
wandering
so
clearly
over
its
surface
you
have
grown
to
be
a
lily
indeed
how
white
and
wan
you
look
she
trembled
and
clung
closer
to
his
breast
ah
papa
she
murmured
they
tried
to
starve
me
into
compliance
with
their
wishes
but
though
my
strength
failed
and
my
beauty
faded
i
would
not
give
up
though
i
thought
i
should
have
died
with
the
weakness
and
the
horror
of
it
all
the
devils
exclaimed
lawrence
smothering
a
stronger
malediction
between
his
lips
papa
she
said
in
her
weak
tones
you
know
all
do
you
not
how
vance
hated
me
for
lancelot
sake
how
she
tried
to
murder
me
yes
my
dear
he
answered
gently
thank
god
her
wicked
attempt
did
not
succeed
a
terrible
retribution
awaits
her
papa
i
can
forgive
her
now
since
i
am
restored
to
you
all
again
said
lily
sweetly
can
not
we
let
her
go
away
and
not
punish
her
for
her
cruelty
i
hated
her
at
first
but
that
is
all
over
with
now
since
she
has
failed
in
her
endeavor
you
know
it
was
all
because
she
loved
my
lancelot
my
love
said
the
banker
your
sweet
forgiveness
is
angelic
but
the
secret
of
vance
crime
is
in
other
hands
than
mine
however
much
we
might
wish
to
shield
her
from
the
consequences
of
her
sin
we
could
not
do
so
the
law
will
have
to
take
its
course
he
did
not
tell
her
of
the
marriage
that
was
to
take
place
between
her
lover
and
vance
that
night
in
her
weak
state
he
feared
to
shock
her
by
the
disclosure
he
hoped
that
they
would
reach
home
before
the
appointed
time
and
forestall
the
dreaded
event
and
he
resolved
that
the
knowledge
of
it
should
never
come
to
lily
hearing
shelton
returned
in
a
few
hours
and
instituted
a
search
as
he
had
suspected
several
sane
persons
were
found
confined
in
the
house
and
these
were
set
at
liberty
swearing
deadly
vengeance
against
heath
and
sundry
wicked
relatives
the
evening
was
far
advanced
and
the
detective
began
to
see
the
necessity
of
his
hastening
miss
lawrence
away
if
they
were
to
reach
fifth
avenue
in
time
to
stop
the
contemplated
marriage
of
lancelot
to
vance
he
accordingly
stated
the
fact
to
lawrence
lily
was
feeling
stronger
and
better
and
declared
her
desire
to
start
immediately
the
carriage
was
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
with
pillows
and
cushions
and
the
young
girl
was
lifted
tenderly
into
it
they
then
set
forth
rapidly
on
their
journey
but
the
early
winter
twilight
had
given
place
to
night
before
they
reached
the
house
lily
heart
beat
rapidly
as
they
reached
home
she
remembered
the
last
time
she
had
glided
up
those
steps
worn
and
weary
but
oh
so
happy
in
the
prospect
of
reunion
with
her
loved
ones
and
the
cruel
hand
that
had
snatched
her
away
in
the
moment
that
she
beheld
the
faces
she
had
so
longed
to
behold
she
clung
convulsively
to
her
father
arm
as
they
stepped
upon
the
pavement
courage
dear
he
whispered
feeling
how
she
trembled
and
how
nervously
she
glanced
about
her
you
are
safe
love
no
one
can
harm
you
now
oh
papa
she
whispered
after
her
first
startled
glance
around
her
what
does
all
this
mean
is
ada
giving
a
party
lawrence
glanced
up
in
dismay
he
knew
what
to
expect
but
he
had
fondly
hoped
to
reach
home
before
matters
went
so
far
the
mansion
was
brilliantly
lighted
from
top
to
bottom
a
silken
awning
extended
from
the
house
out
to
the
street
to
shelter
the
heads
of
the
guests
from
the
few
flying
flakes
of
snow
that
whirled
homelessly
through
the
bitter
cold
air
they
stepped
from
the
carriage
upon
an
elegant
turkey
carpet
that
led
to
the
marble
steps
every
arrangement
betokened
a
grand
reception
and
as
they
walked
through
the
wide
hall
lined
with
staring
servants
the
notes
of
the
wedding
march
pealed
forth
from
the
grand
organ
in
the
oh
god
if
we
should
be
too
late
whispered
lawrence
to
the
detective
it
seems
that
we
are
just
in
time
whispered
shelton
reassuringly
must
we
take
lily
in
with
us
asked
the
banker
dubiously
yes
was
the
firm
reply
and
at
the
words
all
three
stepped
across
the
threshold
of
the
open
door
what
a
startling
sight
met
the
eyes
of
the
fair
young
girl
so
strangely
restored
to
her
home
and
loved
ones
the
room
was
crowded
with
guests
elegantly
arrayed
the
men
in
their
fine
black
reception
suits
the
women
in
their
satins
and
laces
and
sparkling
jewels
flowers
were
in
profusion
everywhere
a
beautiful
formed
with
white
flowers
depended
from
the
ceiling
and
beneath
it
lily
saw
a
group
that
seemed
to
freeze
the
blood
in
her
veins
to
solid
ice
brilliantly
beautiful
flushed
with
love
and
triumph
vance
stood
there
in
elaborate
bridal
robes
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
splendidly
handsome
young
man
his
face
was
slightly
turned
away
but
lily
knew
it
was
none
other
than
her
own
betrothed
lancelot
darling
who
was
listening
so
calmly
there
to
the
opening
words
of
the
beautiful
marriage
service
read
by
the
lips
of
the
and
venerable
clergyman
at
one
glance
she
took
in
the
whole
appalling
scene
and
then
a
shriek
of
agony
loud
piercing
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
stricken
girl
thrilling
every
heart
with
terror
chapter
xxxviii
so
wild
and
startling
was
that
anguished
scream
that
even
the
bride
and
groom
sprang
apart
and
looked
toward
the
door
in
terror
lance
saw
his
lost
darling
standing
there
clinging
to
the
arm
of
her
father
the
dark
hood
thrown
back
from
her
head
and
her
golden
hair
streaming
over
her
shoulders
and
about
her
lovely
face
now
convulsed
with
pain
and
grief
with
a
wild
prescience
of
the
truth
he
rushed
forward
and
with
a
ringing
cry
of
joy
caught
his
darling
to
his
heart
at
the
same
moment
the
clear
full
voice
of
the
detective
pealed
through
the
large
apartment
thronged
with
wedding
guests
with
the
suddenness
of
a
trumpet
call
vance
i
arrest
you
for
the
attempted
murder
of
lily
lawrence
and
that
of
haidee
and
peter
leveret
the
detective
had
instantly
recognized
her
form
as
that
of
the
woman
he
had
seen
walking
in
the
road
near
the
leveret
house
the
day
of
the
murder
and
the
conviction
rushed
upon
him
with
the
suddenness
of
a
flash
of
lightning
none
who
were
present
ever
forgot
the
look
of
the
guilty
woman
as
those
clarion
tones
fell
upon
her
ears
her
brain
was
reeling
with
horror
her
heart
beat
to
suffocation
verge
as
she
beheld
lancelot
clasping
her
rival
to
his
heart
when
the
detective
ringing
voice
with
its
dreadful
accusation
reached
her
hearing
she
turned
her
face
on
him
a
moment
and
its
expression
of
awful
horror
and
black
despair
was
fearful
to
behold
the
next
instant
she
threw
up
her
arms
with
a
wail
of
agony
and
fell
down
in
a
writhing
heap
upon
the
floor
the
aged
minister
who
stood
nearer
to
her
than
the
rest
of
the
guests
hastened
to
lift
her
up
though
he
was
trembling
so
perceptibly
he
could
hardly
stand
as
he
raised
the
dark
head
on
his
arm
and
turned
her
face
upward
to
the
light
a
stream
of
blood
gushed
from
her
lips
and
poured
its
crimson
rain
upon
the
stainless
whiteness
of
her
bridal
robe
and
veil
she
has
burst
a
blood
vessel
said
a
physician
in
the
crowd
now
coming
forward
she
will
die
the
words
reached
her
ears
as
they
knelt
around
her
trying
to
stanch
the
life
tide
flowing
thick
and
fast
from
her
lips
her
dark
eyes
opened
and
stared
up
into
their
faces
with
a
mute
despair
awful
to
behold
she
must
die
that
was
the
only
triumph
that
was
left
her
out
of
the
full
cup
of
happiness
pressed
to
her
lips
overflowingly
but
a
moment
ago
she
might
cheat
the
scaffold
of
its
prey
that
was
all
life
with
all
its
pleasures
and
luxuries
lay
before
her
just
a
moment
before
now
darkness
and
the
grave
like
one
in
a
dream
she
seemed
to
recall
words
carelessly
heard
in
the
past
that
lay
behind
her
forever
beyond
recall
wages
of
sin
is
death
they
gathered
around
her
the
guests
with
their
pale
pale
faces
and
gala
attire
and
looked
at
her
dying
before
them
with
the
awful
stain
of
murder
on
her
soul
that
beautiful
woman
with
the
bridal
wreath
crowning
her
coronal
of
dark
hair
and
her
satin
robe
deluged
with
her
such
a
beautiful
beautiful
sinner
her
haunting
eyes
roved
over
their
faces
restlessly
seeking
seeking
for
one
face
that
was
not
there
stood
apart
with
lawrence
and
ada
showering
caresses
on
the
pale
almost
fainting
girl
lying
on
a
sofa
with
her
dear
ones
clustered
round
her
vance
could
not
see
them
but
her
quick
intuition
told
her
the
truth
and
the
groan
that
burst
from
her
lips
brought
with
it
a
fresh
torrent
of
she
wishes
to
see
someone
i
think
said
the
physician
interpreting
her
yearning
look
she
gave
him
a
glance
of
assent
and
with
a
violent
effort
pronounced
almost
unintelligibly
the
name
of
lance
shelton
who
had
stood
beside
her
carried
the
message
to
lancelot
but
in
his
passionate
anger
against
her
the
young
man
refused
to
go
and
the
detective
went
back
without
him
he
refuses
to
see
you
he
said
with
a
pitying
glance
at
her
ghastly
face
the
streaming
blood
had
ceased
to
flow
for
the
moment
and
as
the
physician
wiped
the
stains
from
her
gasping
lips
she
whispered
brokenly
bring
lily
the
gaping
throng
parted
to
admit
shelton
with
lily
lawrence
clinging
to
his
arm
she
knelt
down
trembling
and
took
into
her
own
white
innocent
hand
the
one
that
had
thrust
the
dagger
into
the
gentle
bosom
her
blue
eyes
beamed
with
the
soft
compassion
of
an
angel
as
she
looked
down
upon
the
fallen
woman
i
am
here
vance
she
said
in
her
sweet
voice
i
am
not
angry
now
i
forgive
you
everything
freely
but
vance
pushed
away
the
hand
that
held
hers
as
if
its
soft
clasp
hurt
her
i
do
not
want
forgiveness
she
gasped
in
broken
yet
defiant
tones
i
want
lance
bring
him
to
me
silently
the
young
girl
turned
away
followed
by
the
wondering
and
admiring
glances
of
all
she
came
back
at
last
bringing
with
her
the
reluctant
one
for
whom
the
dying
woman
waited
longingly
he
bent
down
over
her
trying
to
hide
his
horror
and
aversion
under
a
mask
of
calmness
the
dark
eyes
fast
growing
dim
lighted
up
with
passion
as
she
looked
upon
his
face
i
wanted
to
tell
you
she
gasped
faintly
that
that
all
my
sin
was
for
love
of
you
lance
he
bowed
in
silence
he
had
no
words
with
which
to
answer
her
passionate
avowal
she
is
going
very
fast
said
the
physician
in
a
whisper
shelton
bent
over
her
do
you
confess
your
crimes
he
inquired
in
a
low
voice
her
eyes
left
lancelot
darling
face
one
moment
while
she
gazed
into
that
of
the
detective
you
are
my
accuser
she
faltered
i
am
he
answered
briefly
do
you
confess
she
did
not
answer
her
gaze
had
gone
back
to
lancelot
darling
face
searching
its
cold
immovable
outlines
longingly
the
man
of
god
bent
over
her
gently
do
you
confess
your
sins
he
inquired
no
answer
her
dying
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
one
beloved
face
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
earthly
objects
the
minister
touched
her
arm
gently
i
pray
you
he
said
do
not
suffer
yourself
to
die
with
your
unconfessed
sins
lying
heavy
on
your
soul
she
heard
the
words
and
spoke
faintly
to
her
idol
what
is
it
they
want
of
me
lance
to
confess
your
crimes
he
said
coldly
oh
vance
are
you
indeed
guilty
of
all
with
which
you
are
accused
all
all
she
murmured
hollowly
i
tried
to
kill
lily
first
you
see
then
when
i
felt
safe
from
detection
old
haidee
learned
my
secret
and
threatened
to
tell
my
darling
so
i
poisoned
her
and
the
old
man
both
to
save
myself
but
lance
it
was
all
for
love
of
you
there
was
neither
regret
nor
repentance
in
her
tone
nothing
but
passionate
love
and
despair
he
did
not
answer
and
she
broke
forth
wailingly
oh
lance
do
but
say
that
you
are
sorry
that
i
must
die
say
that
you
might
have
learned
to
love
me
poor
me
if
you
had
not
learned
my
fatal
secret
lance
turned
his
head
away
that
he
might
not
see
the
agonized
pleading
of
her
eyes
and
seeing
that
he
could
not
answer
her
the
minister
again
spoke
gently
vance
the
time
for
human
love
is
over
with
you
now
look
rather
to
the
divine
love
that
is
able
to
pardon
your
sins
though
they
be
as
scarlet
do
you
repent
repent
she
echoed
with
a
wild
and
chilling
laugh
repent
no
never
were
it
all
to
do
over
again
and
the
prize
the
same
i
would
wade
through
seas
of
blood
to
reach
my
darling
heart
all
for
and
my
soul
well
lost
with
the
wild
defiant
words
a
fresh
stream
of
blood
poured
forth
from
her
lips
there
was
a
gasp
a
spasmodic
tremor
of
all
the
features
a
convulsive
quiver
of
the
limbs
and
the
soul
of
the
guilty
woman
went
wandering
forth
into
the
vast
arcana
of
eternity
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
chapter
xxxix
on
the
day
that
lawrence
paid
the
reward
of
ten
thousand
dollars
to
the
detective
lancelot
darling
was
present
he
immediately
wrote
a
check
for
fifteen
thousand
dollars
and
tendered
it
to
shelton
saying
gracefully
allow
me
also
to
testify
some
slight
sense
of
my
gratitude
although
money
alone
can
never
pay
the
great
debt
we
owe
you
our
hearty
appreciation
and
faithful
friendship
shall
unfailingly
pay
the
interest
at
least
added
the
banker
cordially
shelton
fine
features
beamed
with
pride
and
joy
he
felt
a
pardonable
elation
at
the
wonders
his
skill
and
patience
had
accomplished
he
felt
within
himself
the
proud
consciousness
that
his
indefatigable
perseverance
had
nobly
earned
his
success
within
a
few
weeks
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
doctor
pratt
and
harold
colville
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
for
a
long
term
of
years
and
doctor
heath
also
was
duly
punished
for
his
wickedness
the
testimony
of
lily
lawrence
and
fanny
colville
filled
the
thronged
with
horror
on
the
day
of
the
trial
everyone
felt
that
lynching
would
not
be
too
bad
for
such
villains
but
the
sentence
of
the
court
was
duly
carried
out
and
the
wretches
were
incarcerated
in
the
penitentiary
doctor
pratt
served
out
his
sentence
faithfully
when
it
was
ended
he
left
the
shores
of
america
for
a
foreign
land
not
as
some
may
suppose
to
repent
of
his
sins
but
solely
to
hide
his
dishonored
head
from
the
contempt
of
all
who
knew
him
and
begin
again
under
new
auspices
a
second
career
of
vice
and
crime
harold
colville
patience
could
not
uphold
him
as
it
did
his
colleague
the
doctor
solitude
and
confinement
fairly
maddened
him
within
a
few
months
after
the
trial
he
hung
himself
in
his
cell
and
sent
his
wicked
soul
forth
into
the
darkness
of
eternity
fanny
colville
was
thus
left
a
widow
and
on
producing
requisite
evidence
that
she
had
been
the
dead
man
wife
inherited
his
handsome
property
she
took
possession
of
his
wealth
feeling
herself
honestly
entitled
to
it
purchased
a
handsome
house
in
the
city
and
brought
her
old
mother
from
the
country
to
live
with
her
while
the
friendly
mason
was
duly
installed
as
her
housekeeper
in
the
meantime
fanny
had
paid
several
visits
to
lily
lawrence
and
the
two
young
creatures
had
exchanged
numberless
congratulations
with
each
other
on
the
happy
termination
of
their
mutual
trials
i
never
should
have
recognized
you
my
dear
lily
said
frankly
at
their
first
meeting
if
shelton
had
not
informed
me
who
was
coming
when
i
saw
you
i
could
not
believe
that
you
were
not
an
old
woman
now
you
have
grown
young
and
pretty
fanny
laughed
and
blushed
at
the
compliment
and
it
only
made
her
more
attractive
in
truth
she
deserved
lily
praise
her
clear
dark
complexion
began
to
glow
with
health
and
strength
her
softly
rounded
cheeks
had
a
soft
tint
glowing
on
them
like
the
heart
of
a
she
had
beautiful
eyes
large
dark
and
expressive
and
her
black
hair
which
mason
had
shingled
close
to
her
head
now
clustered
in
short
silky
rings
about
her
brow
adding
a
charming
piquancy
to
her
pretty
face
her
dress
too
was
always
as
perfectly
elegant
as
wealth
and
taste
could
make
it
so
that
many
more
beside
lily
lawrence
considered
the
widow
young
and
pretty
shelton
was
among
the
number
of
those
who
agreed
with
lily
the
forlorn
young
creature
whom
he
had
rescued
and
cared
for
had
begun
to
twine
herself
about
his
heart
he
was
a
bachelor
and
forty
years
old
but
his
heart
was
not
proof
against
cupid
darts
now
since
fanny
colville
had
come
into
his
path
of
duty
pity
and
kindness
had
grown
into
love
strong
fervent
and
abiding
he
strolled
into
her
one
day
a
few
months
after
her
husband
death
and
found
her
sitting
cosily
before
the
fire
with
a
bit
of
lying
on
her
lap
i
hope
i
do
not
disturb
you
he
said
noting
her
dreamy
look
you
seemed
to
be
thinking
on
some
very
absorbing
subject
when
i
entered
i
was
thinking
of
you
shelton
returned
the
young
widow
with
a
smile
and
a
slight
blush
of
me
exclaimed
the
detective
observing
the
blush
with
a
thrill
of
pleasure
i
hope
your
thoughts
were
agreeable
ones
they
could
not
be
otherwise
when
i
think
of
my
kind
friend
and
preserver
answered
fanny
giving
him
a
gentle
glance
from
her
frank
dark
eyes
oh
shelton
when
i
think
of
myself
as
i
was
when
you
discovered
me
in
that
loathsome
dungeon
starving
and
freezing
in
my
wretched
rags
and
delivered
me
from
my
bonds
when
i
remember
that
and
contrast
it
with
my
present
happy
lot
i
feel
that
i
can
never
repay
the
great
debt
of
gratitude
i
owe
you
i
fear
he
said
at
length
that
you
overestimate
the
value
of
the
service
i
did
you
colville
it
is
true
i
suppose
that
i
saved
your
life
but
what
then
life
to
many
is
not
as
great
a
boon
that
they
would
thank
one
for
saving
it
ah
but
they
are
misanthropic
returned
fanny
brightly
life
to
me
shelton
is
a
great
boon
i
love
to
live
i
love
to
feel
the
warm
blood
rushing
through
my
veins
with
the
ardor
of
youth
and
hope
i
love
to
feel
my
pulses
bounding
with
life
fitful
fever
oh
shelton
can
i
do
nothing
to
show
my
gratitude
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
the
detective
drew
nearer
and
took
her
soft
warm
hand
impulsively
in
his
own
yes
dear
fanny
he
said
his
deep
manly
voice
trembling
with
emotion
give
me
the
life
i
saved
for
my
reward
give
me
your
own
sweet
self
for
the
of
my
future
be
my
wife
blushing
and
startled
fanny
looked
up
into
his
face
but
her
eyes
drooped
swiftly
before
the
great
tenderness
in
his
the
next
moment
she
laid
both
hands
in
his
and
whispered
between
april
smiles
and
tears
take
me
if
i
can
make
you
happy
i
ask
no
brighter
fate
chapter
xl
it
was
the
close
of
new
year
day
and
lily
and
ada
lawrence
stood
together
in
the
grand
their
arms
fondly
interlaced
the
glow
of
firelight
and
gaslight
shining
down
like
a
blessing
on
their
golden
heads
ada
was
perfectly
lovely
in
an
elegant
costume
of
white
cashmere
and
blue
brocaded
silk
the
only
ornaments
of
her
fair
girlish
beauty
were
knots
of
fragrant
blue
and
white
violets
my
darling
sister
said
the
younger
girl
affectionately
you
look
very
weary
sit
down
here
in
this
comfortable
and
rest
she
drew
forward
the
chair
as
she
spoke
but
before
lily
could
seat
herself
two
more
visitors
were
announced
they
were
lancelot
darling
and
philip
john
lancelot
friend
was
duly
presented
to
lily
and
after
a
little
friendly
chatter
lance
stole
away
with
his
darling
to
the
quiet
library
my
dearest
i
am
very
selfish
he
said
to
her
fondly
i
want
you
all
to
myself
that
i
may
look
at
you
listen
to
you
and
feel
that
my
happiness
is
real
and
not
a
dream
from
which
i
may
awaken
to
the
pangs
of
bereavement
they
sat
down
together
on
a
low
divan
before
the
glowing
fire
lancelot
drew
the
golden
head
down
upon
his
breast
and
pressed
passionate
lingering
kisses
on
the
sweet
red
lips
of
his
darling
my
darling
he
whispered
presently
our
has
been
long
deferred
when
shall
i
have
the
happiness
of
claiming
you
before
all
the
world
papa
and
ada
could
not
bear
to
give
me
up
yet
said
lily
smiling
at
his
eagerness
i
do
not
want
to
be
selfish
love
he
said
i
know
you
wish
to
stay
with
them
a
little
longer
and
i
know
how
hard
it
would
be
to
them
to
give
you
up
now
but
you
must
pity
my
loneliness
and
come
to
me
soon
i
want
to
get
my
roses
back
first
she
answered
demurely
i
am
so
weak
and
weary
from
all
that
i
have
suffered
that
i
should
be
a
pale
and
faded
bride
if
i
came
to
you
now
you
must
wait
dear
lance
until
i
grow
strong
and
well
again
before
i
don
the
bridal
veil
how
long
must
i
wait
then
he
inquired
till
the
roses
come
again
she
answered
you
know
how
i
love
the
summer
with
its
beautiful
sunshine
and
fragrant
flowers
i
should
like
for
the
happiest
event
of
my
life
to
be
associated
with
the
sweetest
month
in
the
year
let
it
be
in
june
lance
was
beginning
a
passionate
protest
when
the
door
opened
and
lawrence
entered
the
banker
looked
very
bright
and
happy
as
his
eyes
fell
on
the
handsome
pair
before
him
here
papa
said
lily
making
room
for
him
beside
her
i
am
very
glad
you
have
come
for
i
think
lance
was
just
about
to
find
fault
with
me
on
what
pretext
inquired
her
father
kissing
her
sweet
upturned
lips
for
cruelty
said
lance
promptly
she
actually
intends
to
defer
our
marriage
until
june
soon
enough
said
the
banker
laughing
at
the
young
man
impatience
you
must
leave
us
our
darling
yet
awhile
lance
come
and
see
her
every
day
if
you
choose
my
boy
but
do
not
persuade
her
to
leave
us
yet
it
will
be
hard
to
give
her
up
even
to
you
when
the
beautiful
month
of
roses
came
round
again
lawrence
had
to
lose
both
his
lovely
daughters
philip
john
had
wooed
and
won
the
beautiful
girlish
ada
and
bridal
day
was
to
be
hers
also
once
again
lily
stood
in
her
old
familiar
chamber
with
the
robes
of
satin
and
lace
trailing
over
the
velvet
carpet
and
the
snowy
mist
of
the
bridal
veil
hiding
the
blushes
that
came
and
went
on
her
lovely
face
there
is
no
one
to
envy
your
happiness
now
lily
said
ada
as
she
clasped
the
pearl
necklace
around
her
sister
snowy
neck
that
dreadful
woman

dead
it
is
so
cruel
a
thing
to
remember
dear
let
us
try
to
forget
the
sin
and
forgive
the
sinner
amen
said
ada
solemnly
lawrence
came
in
and
kissed
and
blessed
them
with
a
sadness
on
his
face
that
he
could
not
wholly
hide
the
only
alleviation
to
the
sorrow
of
that
hour
was
the
knowledge
that
he
was
giving
the
happiness
of
his
beloved
children
into
the
keeping
of
good
men
and
true
papa
you
must
not
forget
what
i
told
you
once
before
whispered
lily
through
april
tears
and
smiles

will
not
lose
your
daughters
you
will
only
gain
two
sons
lily
was
to
go
to
a
beautiful
home
on
fifth
avenue
close
to
that
of
her
father
lancelot
had
been
busy
for
months
preparing
his
splendid
mansion
for
the
of
his
bride
and
now
it
only
awaited
the
sunshine
of
her
presence
to
become
an
earthly
eden
ada
and
her
husband
were
to
live
with
the
banker
his
great
house
would
be
so
lonely
the
old
man
pleaded
with
both
his
darlings
gone
so
they
yielded
to
his
wish
and
promised
to
make
his
house
their
home
as
long
as
he
lived
the
grand
portals
of

opened
wide
to
admit
the
two
lovely
brides

never
seen
a
grander
marriage
nor
brides
so
lovely
nor
bridegrooms
more
gallant
and
handsome
trinity
was
thronged
with
their
friends
and
the
pavements
outside
were
crowded
with
interested
spectators
no
marriage
had
excited
so
much
interest
for
years
as
that
of
the
lovely
girl
whose
romantic
story
was
known
far
and
wide
she
is
beautiful
as
a
dream
they
whispered
when
the
first
bride
passed
over
the
pavement
to
the
church
steps
and
the
sister
is
equally
lovely
they
cried
rapturously
when
the
trembling
ada
followed
after
her
god
bless
them
both
whispered
a
good
woman
who
had
a
prominent
seat
in
the
church
it
was
mason
the
kind
soul
whom
lily
had
not
forgotten
when
her
wedding
cards
were
issued
to
her
friends
so
amid
good
wishes
and
blessings
the
fair
brides
passed
up
the
stately
aisle
on
the
arms
of
their
father
followed
by
a
score
of
lovely
bridesmaids
in
snowy
robes
at
the
altar
they
were
met
by
lancelot
and
philip
and
then
above
the
pealing
notes
of
the
wedding
march
the
minister
voice
arose
in
the
beautiful
words
of
the
marriage
service
silence
brooded
over
the
throng
softly
as
the
wings
of
a
dove
while
the
holy
reverent
words
filled
the
church
in
the
stillness
the
sweet
responses
of
the
brides
even
were
distinctly
audible
the
rings
were
slipped
upon
their
fingers
the
solemn
words
of
the
benediction
were
spoken
and
then
with
the
sweet
strains
of
music
echoing
above
their
heads
the
fragrance
of
flowers
beneath
their
feet
and
the
tender
blessings
of
friends
around
them
the
two
beautiful
brides
with
their
chosen
mates
went
forth
with
smiles
to
the
future
that
lay
beaming
in
the
sunshine
of
love
and
happiness

the
small
figure
perched
on
the

of
a
large
saratoga
trunk
sprang
down
upon

so
vehemently
that

to

cried
queenie
indignantly
indeed
i
mamma
i
will

said
her
sister
sydney
calmly
i
see
no
use
in
taking
a
child
like
you
to
kirk
grand
ball
a
child
indeed
flashed
the
younger
sister
with
a
pout
of
her
rosebud
lips
i
am
as
tall
as
you
syd
and
i
was
seventeen
yesterday
it
real
mean
to
call
me
a
child
and
leave
me
at
home
every
time
i
get
invited
out
i
know
why
it
is
though
it
because
mamma
spends
every
dollar
papa
gives
her
decking
out
you
and
georgie
and
there
never
a
decent
thing
left
for
me
to
wear

is
because
you
are
too
pretty
my
dear
laughed
her
father
who
had
entered
the
unnoticed
the
girls
keep
you
back
because
they
are
afraid
you
will
cut
them
out
with
their
fine
beaux
sydney
and
georgina
flushed
angrily
and
muttered
that
it
was
so
and
that
papa
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
it
was
all
his
fault
that
queenie
was
setting
herself
up
for
a
woman
so
fast
when
he
afford
to
dress
the
two
that
were
already
grown
decently
enough
for
the
position
they
had
to
fill
in
society
the
poor
worried
mother
having
been
so
quickly
snubbed
on
the
subject
of
the
old
green
silk
looked
on
and
said
nothing
i
give
you
every
cent
i
can
spare
from
my
business
girls
said
lyle
in
a
vexed
tone
and
this
time
i
strained
a
point
and
pinched
myself
in
order
that
little
queenie
might
have
a
new
dress
and
go
to
the
ball
too
but
they
have
spent
every
cent
upon
themselves
cried
pretty
little
queenie
with
the
tears
of
vexation
standing
in
her
eyes
the
is
littered
all
over
with
their
finery
yet
they
want
me
to
wear
that
horrid
green
silk
of
syd
a
pretty
fright
i
should
look
never
mind
dear
you
can
stay
at
home
with
your
old
papa
your
time
will
come
after
awhile
when
the
girls
are
married
and
out
of
the
way
said
her
father
kindly
as
he
drew
his
arm
about
her
maybe
it
is
true
that
i
have
spoiled
you
dear
and
that
you
are
too
young
to
go
to
such
a
grand
ball
no
i
am
not
papa
i
am
quite
old
enough
and
i
know
how
to
dance
and
i
love
to
dance
and
i
go
to
the
ball
exclaimed
the
pretty
willful
little
creature
with
flushed
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
but
queenie
what
on
earth
will
you
wear
asked
the
poor
tired
mother
who
was
quite
worn
out
with
the
worry
of
keeping
herself
and
her
two
elder
girls
i
have
no
money
to
give
you
a
new
dress
queenie
stood
meditating
with
her
head
perched
on
one
side
like
a
little
bird
her
slender
arched
brows
puckered
into
a
thoughtful
frown
i
tell
you
said
she
at
length
i
shall
sell
my
painted
fan
the
white
satin
one
that
uncle
rob
sent
me
from
paris
it
is
worth
fifteen
dollars
at
least
and
i
can
certainly
get
five
for
it
five
dollars
will
buy
lots
of
white
tarleton
and
i
can
make
the
dress
myself
there
are
plenty
of
flowers
in
the
garden
so
you
see
i
can
make
a
toilet
for
the
ball
she
added
half
laughing
sell
uncle
rob
gift
cried
mamma
and
the
girls
in
concert
necessity
knows
no
law
answered
queenie
dancing
out
of
the
room
to
avoid
their
remonstrances
lyle
you
really
should
not
allow
her
to
sell
her
uncle
beautiful
gift
exclaimed
lyle
in
a
vexed
tone
i
certainly
shall
not
try
to
prevent
her
answered
her
husband
rather
shortly
if
you
had
acted
fairly
by
her
and
divided
the
money
i
gave
you
for
the
three
girls
she
need
not
have
been
driven
to
such
straits
as
to
sell
her
pretty
fan
why
i
gave
you
a
hundred
dollars
and
she
only
wants
five
for
her
dress
you
might
have
spared
her
that
small
pittance
i
did
not
think
she
would
be
contented
with
such
a
shabby
dress
muttered
lyle
queenie
only
wants
to
enjoy
herself
said
the
fond
father
she
will
be
as
beautiful
and
as
happy
in
her
tarleton
as
georgie
and
sydney
in
their
elegant
silks
chapter
ii
full
of
her
suddenly
conceived
purpose
queenie
lyle
went
to
her
room
attired
herself
in
a
neat
and
tied
a
blue
tissue
veil
over
her
luxuriant
golden
ringlets
then
carefully
wrapping
a
paper
about
the
box
that
held
her
painted
fan
she
set
forth
upon
her
errand
feeling
sorry
that
she
must
part
with
the
elegant
trifle
yet
determined
to
sacrifice
it
rather
than
forego
the
ball
which
to
her
young
imaginative
fancy
appeared
like
a
promised
peep
into
in
the
large
city
where
she
lived
there
were
plenty
of
stores
that
dealt
in
fancy
articles
she
entered
one
of
these
stores
and
presented
her
fan
for
the
merchant
inspection
how
much
will
you
give
me
for
it
asked
she
childishly
coming
straight
to
the
point
did
you
paint
it
yourself
asked
the
man
unfurling
the
beautiful
fan
and
gazing
admiringly
at
the
delicate
leaves
and
flowers
painted
upon
it
by
a
skillful
hand
queenie
laughed
at
the
question
and
the
gay
musical
chime
attracted
the
attention
of
a
gentleman
a
little
further
down
the
counter
a
tall
dark
handsome
man
who
drew
nearer
as
if
fascinated
and
glanced
furtively
at
the
young
girl
revealing
a
lovely
face
as
fresh
and
fair
as
a
flower
the
eyes
as
dark
as
pansies
the
cheeks
as
pink
as
roses
she
was
smiling
that
moment
and
the
stranger
saw
two
dazzling
rows
of
teeth
between
her
parted
crimson
lips
and
the
loveliest
dimples
in
the
world
in
her
rounded
cheeks
and
chin
no
indeed
she
said
in
answer
to
the
merchant
my
uncle
sent
it
to
me
from
paris
it
is
quite
french
i
assure
you
i
would
not
part
with
it
if
i
did
not
need
the
money
very
much
we
are
overcrowded
with
such
articles
miss
said
the
man
carelessly
not
wishing
to
show
his
anxiety
to
possess
the
elegant
fan
but
to
oblige
you
and
because
you
need
the
money
i
will
give
you
five
dollars
for
it
very
well
i
will
take
it
said
little
queenie
and
as
she
spoke
she
looked
up
carelessly
and
suddenly
encountered
the
fixed
gaze
of
a
pair
of
burning
dark
eyes
blushing
crimson
she
knew
not
why
queenie
dropped
the
sweeping
lashes
over
her
eyes
and
taking
her
money
from
the
merchant
hurriedly
left
the
store
a
pretty
trifle
what
will
you
take
for
it
said
the
handsome
stranger
stepping
forward
as
queenie
went
out
twenty
dollars
answered
the
merchant
coolly
it
is
a
real
parisian
fan
and
worth
more
than
that
but
as
i
bought
it
so
cheap
i
will
let
you
have
it
at
a
small
profit
do
you
know
the
young
lady
from
whom
you
bought
it
inquired
the
gentleman
as
he
laid
down
a
bill
on
the
counter
no
i
do
not
but
she
was
a
little
beauty
laughed
the
merchant
as
he
wrapped
up
the
fan
and
handed
it
to
his
customer
the
handsome
stranger
bowed
and
hastily
withdrew
with
his
purchase
in
the
street
he
paused
and
looked
up
and
down
seeing
queenie
graceful
little
figure
half
a
square
ahead
of
him
he
slowly
walked
on
after
her
little
queenie
went
into
a
dry
goods
store
and
invested
the
price
of
her
fan
in
a
nice
quality
of
white
tarleton
she
told
the
obliging
clerk
where
to
send
the
package
and
dropping
her
veil
over
her
sweet
face
hurried
homeward
queenie
oh
queenie
come
in
called
georgina
as
she
was
passing
the
open
door
of
the
only

something
so
perfectly
splendid
has
happened
guess
what
it
is
you
have
been
buying
some
more
finery

answered
the
young
girl
seeing
a
large
box
in
the
center
of
the
floor
uncle
rob
has
sent
us
another
box
from
paris
announced
sydney
triumphantly

and
jewelry
both
added
lyle
joyfully

go
to
the
ball
as
fine
as
a
queen
now
laughed
georgina
diving
down
into
the
box
and
bringing
out
a
parcel
which
she
placed
in
queenie
hands
it
is
for
you
she
said
queenie
unrolled
the
tissue
paper
from
the
bundle
and
shook
out
the
folds
of
a
magnificent
brocade
silk
oh
how
exquisite
she
exclaimed
what
has
he
sent
you
girls
sydney
who
was
a
brilliant
brunette
exhibited
a
brocade
as
handsome
as
queenie
dress
georgina
a
plump
blonde
rejoiced
in
the
possession
of
a
costly
azure
satin
uncle

exclaimed
little
queenie
delightedly
and
only
look

lyle

held
three

her
lap

has
sent
you
each
a
lovely
set
of
jewels

for
sydney
opals
for
georgina
pearls
for
you
little
queenie
looked
and
admired
until
she
was
almost
wild
with
delight
she
clasped
the
pearls
on
her
neck
and
arms
and
held
the
rich
brocade
up
before
her
admiring
the
sheeny
richness
of
the
creamy
folds
if
you
had
only
waited
a
little
while
you
need
not
have
sold
your
painted
fan
said
georgie

can
have
this
lovely
dress
to
wear
to
kirk
ball

i
can

answered
queenie
with
a
sigh
madame
dufarge
would
charge
thirty
dollars
to
make
such
a
dress
as
this
and
where
could
i
get
thirty
dollars
no
i
wear
my
tarleton
and
the
pearls
to
the
ball
but
i
will
put
this
lovely
brocade
away
and
keep
it
for
my
only
hear
the
child
exclaimed
sydney
who
was
and
unmarried
yet
she
talks
of
marrying
as
confidently
as
if
husbands
grew
on
trees
they
do
for
pretty
girls
like
me
answered
queenie
with
a
saucy
nod
at
her
sister
but
mamma
did
uncle
robbie
write
is
he
getting
well
is
he
coming
home
soon
ah
the
best
of
the
news
is
yet
to
come
exclaimed
georgina
who
was
in
brilliant
spirits
we
are
to
go
out
to
uncle
robbie
you
and
i
and
syd
and
mamma
and
have
a
continental
tour
with
him
is
that
glorious
news
little
queenie
bright
eyes
danced
with
joy
mamma
is
it
true
she
panted
breathlessly
yes
dear
it
is
quite
true
said
lyle
looking
quite
happy
he
has
sent
us
a
check
and
we
are
to
go
over
in
the
which
sails
three
months
from
now
we
are
to
employ
ourselves
in
the
interim
polishing
up
our
french
hurrah
for
uncle
rob
exclaimed
the
delighted
little
queenie
boyishly
waving
her
hat
around
her
head
he
is
a
perfect
fairy
prince
the
dream
of
my
life
has
been
to
go
to
europe
i
think
will
need
to
polish
more
than
your
french
queenie
exclaimed
sydney
peevishly
your
manners
are
as
rude
as
a
and
yours
are
as
prim
as
an
old
maid
retorted
queenie
maliciously
for
sydney
perpetual
was
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
to
the
petted
little
creature
sydney
flushed
crimson
at
the
retort
her
years
were
verging
so
near
to
the
line
of
that
she
was
particularly
sensitive
on
the
subject
she
now
said
angrily
mamma
can
you
sit
silently
there
and
permit
queenie
to
address
me
so
disrespectfully
lyle
looked
at
her
youngest
daughter
imploringly
queenie
how
often
have
i
scolded
you
for
aggravating
sydney
apologize
to
her
immediately
queenie
looked
at
sydney
tearful
eyes
and
flushed
cheeks
and
her
tender
little
heart
melted
at
once
she
crossed
over
and
put
her
round
white
arms
about
sydney
stately
neck
sister
do
forgive
me
she
said
sweetly
i
did
not
mean
a
word
of
it
your
manners
are
simply
perfection
and
i
only
wish
that
mine
were
half
as
polished
you
should
cultivate
yourself
answered
sydney
coldly
as
she
put
the
clinging
arms
away
from
her
neck
i
am
ashamed
of
your
hoydenish
manners
i
try
to
cultivate
myself
sydney
indeed
i
will
answered
queenie
innocently
i
am
so
young
yet
you
know
i
have
time
to
learn
a
great
many
things
sydney
bit
her
lip
and
made
no
reply
there
was
nothing
she
envied
so
much
as
queenie
tender
youth
and
to
have
it
thrust
upon
her
notice
like
that
however
innocently
was
unendurable
the
silence
that
fell
was
becoming
awkward
when
a
servant
entered
the
room
with
a
small
parcel
which
she
laid
in
queenie
hand
a
small
boy
left
it
at
the
door
for
you
she
said
as
she
withdrew
queenie
stared
at
the
parcel
in
bewilderment
it
had
a
familiar
look
open
it
my
dear
said
lyle
curiously
queenie
tore
off
the
paper
and
a
box
was
revealed
she
took
off
the
lid
with
a
trembling
hand
within
the
box
lay
the
painted
fan
she
had
sold
an
hour
ago
to
the
dealer
on
street
what
is
this
said
georgina
stooping
down
she
picked
up
a
card
that
had
fallen
from
the
box
upon
it
was
written
in
a
clear
bold
manly
hand
from
an
unknown
admirer
of
miss
queenie
lyle
someone
has
sent
your
painted
fan
back
to
you
exclaimed
lyle
how
kind
but
who
could
it
have
been
queenie
has
caught
a
beau
said
georgina
laughing
involuntarily
queenie
thoughts
reverted
to
the
stranger
who
had
looked
at
her
in
the
store
but
she
said
nothing
chapter
iii
who
is
the
young
miss
lyle
sydney
lyle
coming
down
the
long
on
the
arm
of
the
most
distinguished
man
in
the
room
looked
up
with
annoyance
at
his
words
she
followed
his
glance
and
saw
little
queenie
standing
in
the
center
of
a
group
of
admirers
fluttering
her
satin
fan
with
the
grace
of
an
embryo
coquette
the
girl
looked
lovely
as
a
dream
in
her
thin
white
dress
with
its
multitudinous
puffings
and
frillings
it
was
looped
here
and
there
with
natural
rosebuds
and
she
wore
her
set
of
pearls
clasped
round
her
white
throat
and
wrists
while
her
golden
hair
rippled
to
her
waist
in
a
shower
of
natural
ringlets
anything
more
sweetly
fair
and
happy
could
scarcely
be
imagined
than
queenie
as
she
stood
there
warm
and
flushed
from
the
dance
and
enjoying
with
all
the
keenness
of
youth
and
novelty
the
honied
flatteries
of
the
little
court
around
her
an
irrepressible
pang
of
jealousy
gave
a
touch
of
sharpness
to
sydney
voice
as
she
answered
that
is
my
sister
queenie
captain
ernscliffe
a
willful
child
who
ought
to
be
in
the
this
moment
but
who
has
persuaded
mamma
to
let
her
come
here
instead
ah
your
sister
said
captain
ernscliffe
i
might
have
known
it
by
her
beauty
she
has
lived
near
the
and
he
pointed
the
compliment
by
a
meaning
glance
that
made
sydney
blush
you
will
introduce
me
miss
lyle
certainly
sydney
answered
and
pausing
beside
queenie
she
said
carelessly
captain
ernscliffe
this
is
my
sister
queenie
if
she
should
shock
you
by
her
manners
please
remember
that
she
is
but
a
child
and
quite
unaccustomed
to
appear
in
society
captain
ernscliffe
bowed
low
over
the
hand
of
the
enchanting
little
beauty
and
queenie
looked
up
at
him
and
said
with
a
flash
of
wrath
against
sydney
you
need
not
believe
sydney
when
she
tells
you
i
am
nothing
but
a
child
captain
ernscliffe
i
am
years
old
and
i
know
how
to
behave
myself
just
as
well
as
any
young
lady
of
my
age
in
spite
of
sydney
warning
the
gentleman
saw
that
the
young
heart
was
sorely
wounded
despite
her
quick
assumption
of
dignity
and
hastened
to
say
consolingly
i
can
well
believe
you
miss
queenie
for
i
see
there
is
but
one
unanimous
opinion
among
the
gentlemen
you
are
the
belle
of
the
ball
sydney
passed
on
with
the
words
rankling
in
her
heart
though
she
knew
that
they
were
true
among
all
the
beautiful
women
present
in
their
cosily
dresses
and
splendid
jewels
little
queenie
with
her
sunny
smile
and
her
cheap
white
tarleton
dress
was
the
most
admired
and
sought
after
the
women
who
envied
her
fresh
young
loveliness
sneered
at
the
simple
dress
but
the
men
bless
their
ignorant
hearts
did
not
know
whether
the
snowy
mist
that
floated
about
her
cost
a
hundred
dollars
or
five
they
only
saw
that
her
face
was
the
fairest
her
eyes
the
brightest
her
voice
the
sweetest
of
any
in
the
room
lyle
saw
the
sensation
she
created
and
straightway
began
to
lay
matrimonial
plans
for
her
sydney
and
georgina
are
both
handsome
and
stylish
yet
they
are
very
slow
in
marrying
off
well
she
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
perhaps
i
shall
have
better
luck
with
my
willful
queenie
there
is
that
rich
ernscliffe
with
her
now
he
is
a
splendid
catch
but
then
sydney
has
had
her
heart
set
on
him
this
long
while
she
would
be
very
angry
if
queenie
were
to
rival
her
in
the
meantime
little
queenie
was
clapping
her
tiny
hands
and
saying
in
a
voice
full
of
girlish
pleasure
the
belle
of
the
ball
captain
ernscliffe
oh
how
nice
that
is
i
love
for
people
to
like
me
yet
syd
and
george
said
that
no
one
would
look
at
me
in
this
cheap
dress
that
i
bought
for
five
dollars
and
made
with
my
own
hands
it
is
the
prettiest
dress
in
the
rooms
i
had
no
idea
but
that
it
cost
at
least
a
hundred
dollars
said
captain
ernscliffe
regarding
the
puffs
attentively
and
your
bouquet
as
the
ladies
say
is
too
sweet
for
anything
was
it
a
tribute
from
some
admirer
she
blushed
and
smiled
and
lifted
the
fragrant
triumph
of
the
floral
art
to
her
sweet
face
you
have
guessed
right
she
said
it
was
handed
in
at
our
door
this
evening
with
the
compliments
of
an
unknown
admirer
the
fellow
had
fine
taste
anyway
laughed
the
captain
both
in
the
selection
of
the
flowers
and
their
recipient
thank
you
answered
queenie
demurely
looking
up
with
a
smile
and
dropping
her
lashes
very
quickly
a
minute
after
for
something
in
the
glance
of
his
dark
eyes
sent
a
blush
to
her
cheek
and
made
her
silly
little
heart
thrill
strangely
captain
ernscliffe
only
smiled
like
one
used
to
such
effects
he
was
a
bachelor
and
thirty
years
old
and
women
called
him
a
flirt
be
that
as
it
may
he
was
as
handsome
as
a
prince
and
knew
how
to
make
lashes
flutter
down
upon
cheeks
that
blushed
crimson
under
his
glance
what
an
innocent
little
darling
she
is
he
thought
to
himself
how
different
from
her
sisters
and
from
the
girls
one
meets
usually
in
society
one
might
well
resign
all
the
liberties
of
bachelorhood
to
win
and
wear
so
sweet
a
flower
doubtless
you
have
woven
a
pretty
web
of
romance
about
the
unknown
giver
of
your
flowers
miss
lyle
he
said
jestingly
she
had
pressed
the
flowers
to
her
lips
unconsciously
and
at
his
words
she
started
and
smiled
and
looked
up
to
reply
with
the
brightest
face
he
had
ever
looked
upon
but
suddenly
before
a
single
word
left
her
lips
her
aspect
changed
strangely
and
marvelously
her
cheeks
and
lips
grew
white
as
death
her
eyes
grew
wild
with
horror
and
she
swept
her
hand
across
her
brow
as
if
to
dispel
some
horrid
vision
her
form
trembled
like
a
leaf
in
a
storm
and
with
a
wild
inarticulate
cry
she
wavered
and
fell
in
a
lifeless
heap
at
captain
ernscliffe
feet
it
was
all
so
sudden
that
captain
ernscliffe
lifted
her
up
and
carried
her
through
the
low
window
out
on
the
balcony
before
anyone
had
noticed
her
fall
he
laid
her
down
on
a
rustic
lounge
turned
her
white
face
up
to
the
air
and
went
and
called
her
mother
very
quietly
oh
captain
ernscliffe
is
she
dead
exclaimed
lyle
wringing
her
hands
in
terror
oh
no
she
has
only
fainted
i
think
the
rooms
were
too
warm
perhaps
see
she
is
already
reviving
in
the
cooler
air
out
here
the
girl
breath
came
fluttering
back
in
a
long
quivering
sigh
she
caught
captain
ernscliffe
arm
and
herself
without
seeming
to
notice
her
mother
oh
captain
ernscliffe
did
you
see
she
gasped
rather
than
spoke
did
i
see
he
inquired
rather
blankly
the
vision
that
came
between
me
and
the
flowers
and
made
me
faint
she
answered
sitting
up
and
looking
at
him
in
surprise
my
dear
young
lady
there
was
nothing
to
see
only
the
dancers
you
were
tired
and
excited
and
the
heat
overcame
you
you
are
unaccustomed
to
the
crush
and
excitement
of
balls
you
know
and
saw
nothing
but
the
she
said
to
him
shivering
as
she
spoke
like
one
in
a
chill
and
passing
her
hand
before
her
eyes
nothing
i
assure
you
he
answered
gravely
what
did
you
see
queenie
inquired
lyle
coming
forward
oh
mamma
is
that
you
little
queenie
reached
out
her
white
arms
twined
them
about
her
mother
neck
and
sank
on
her
bosom
trembling
and
shivering
and
moaning
faintly
oh
mamma
mamma
my
dear
my
dear
compose
yourself
you
are
nervous
and
hysterical
remonstrated
lyle
see
you
are
distressing
captain
ernscliffe
very
much
little
queenie
hushed
her
sobs
and
looked
up
at
the
gentleman
who
did
indeed
look
anxious
and
distressed
what
was
it
you
saw
miss
lyle
he
inquired
gently
perhaps
you
will
not
credit
it
she
said
lifting
her
white
face
in
the
moonlight
that
flooded
the
balcony
but
captain
ernscliffe
just
as
i
looked
up
from
my
flowers
to
speak
to
you
the
whole
scene
of
the
ball
faded
out
into
and
then
i
saw
a
vision
come
before
me
in
its
place
she
paused
shuddered
visibly
then
resumed
i
saw
a
thick
dark
wood
before
me
with
the
falling
down
through
the
leaves
of
the
trees
i
saw
a
tall
man
with
his
back
to
me
and
close
by
that
man
was
a
a
shallow
grave
so
shallow
that
it
could
not
hide
the
girl
that
lay
within
it
for
the
wind
and
the
rain
had
beaten
away
the
earth
and
the
dead
leaves
with
which
the
man
had
covered
her
i
saw
her
awfully
white
dead
face
upturned
to
the
light
and
there
were
cruel
black
marks
around
her
throat
as
if
someone
had
choked
her
and
a
purple
wound
on
her
brow
my
darling
it
was
only
your
excited
imagination
said
lyle
soothingly
oh
no
i
saw
it
quite
plainly
answered
little
queenie
with
a
sharp
wail
of
anguish
and
oh
mamma
mamma
face
of
that
dead
girl
was
just
exactly
like
chapter
iv
i
always
knew
you
were
a
little
simpleton
queenie
but
i
never
thought
you
could
be
so
foolish
and
ungrateful
as
this
no
girl
in
her
senses
would
refuse
the
chance
of
spending
captain
ernscliffe
money
three
months
had
elapsed
since
the
grand
ball
at
kirk
and
queenie
lyle
was
arraigned
before
the
bar
of
maternal
justice
little
queenie
had
spent
those
three
months
in
a
perfect
whirl
of
excitement
pleasure
and
conquest
and
now
captain
ernscliffe
the
irresistible
the
invincible
had
surrendered
at
discretion
and
actually
proposed
to
marry
her
and
little
queenie
lyle
had
had
the
audacity
to
refuse
the
honor
to
think
went
on
lyle
reproachfully
how
we
have
humored
and
indulged
you
the
last
three
months
and
all
for
this
you
have
been
to
all
the
balls
and
parties
worth
going
to
you
have
had
nice
dresses
and
laces
and
we
all
thought
you
would
marry
off
well
and
rid
your
papa
of
one
of
his
expensive
daughters
yet
last
month
you
refused
that
rich
old
myddleton
i
did
not
care
as
much
for
that
for
i
saw
that
ernscliffe
was
madly
in
love
and
thought
you
would
be
sure
to
accept
him
yet
now
you
have
actually
refused
him
too
you
wicked
ungrateful
girl
mamma
mamma
pleaded
queenie
with
a
quivering
lip
do
not
be
angry
with
me
i
could
not
marry
captain
ernscliffe
because
i
do
not
love
him
then
if
you
do
not
love
you
can
never
love
anyone
exclaimed
lyle
he
is
handsome
accomplished
wealthy
and
there
not
a
girl
i
know
but
would
jump
at
chance
sydney
not
excepted
sydney
him
mamma
let
her
marry
him
she
can
not
get
him
more
the
pity
i
wish
he
had
fancied
her
instead
of
you
said
lyle
sharply
i
wish
so
too
mamma
i
am
very
sorry
for
sydney
and
for
captain
ernscliffe
too
said
queenie
with
a
long
quivering
sigh
you
had
better
be
sorry
for
yourself
foolish
girl
you
have
thrown
away
the
best
chance
for
marrying
that
you
ever
will
have
exclaimed
lyle
angrily
for
she
was
deeply
chagrined
at
queenie
willful
disregard
of
her
best
interests
to
her
surprise
queenie
threw
herself
down
at
her
feet
and
began
to
sob
wildly
mamma
i
am
sorry
for
myself
she
moaned
faintly
so
sorry
that
i
wish
i
were
dead
for
shame
queenie
to
go
into
such
a
passion
because
i
scolded
you
get
up
and
stop
making
a
baby
of
yourself
said
her
mother
severely
little
queenie
dried
her
eyes
at
that
sharp
reproof
and
went
on
with
her
packing
which
lyle
entrance
had
interrupted
for
they
were
to
sail
for
europe
that
week
and
the
house
was
with
their
preparations
her
mother
sat
moodily
watching
her
as
she
folded
silks
and
laces
and
packed
them
away
securely
in
the
great
saratoga
trunk
what
have
you
in
that
box
queenie
she
inquired
seeing
the
girl
put
a
box
in
the
trunk
with
a
glance
you
look
as
if
you
were
smuggling
something
queenie
blushed
violently
and
lyle
saw
that
she
trembled
as
she
answered
falteringly
nothing
of
any
importance
i
assure
you
mamma
let
me
see
said
lyle
resolutely
and
she
took
the
box
from
the
trunk
and
lifted
the
lid
why
what
have
we
here
flowers
withered
flowers
queenie
why
upon
earth
are
you
keeping
these
dead
things
throw
them
out
of
the
window
oh
no
mamma
cried
queenie
blushing
very
much
and
trying
to
take
the
box
from
her
mother
hand
but
lyle
held
on
to
the
box
and
took
out
three
bouquets
of
withered
flowers
and
three
cards
that
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
box
she
read
aloud
from
an
unknown
admirer
of
miss
queenie
lyle
oh
dear
dear
said
lyle
impatiently
now
i
begin
to
understand
these
flowers
which
were
sent
by
some
impudent
fellow
have
made
a
fool
of
you
queenie
you
have
been
building
a
romance
over
him
and
that
is
why
you
have
no
eyes
for
better
men
tell
me
the
truth
now
queenie
do
you
know
who
sent
you
these
flowers
how
should
i
know
mamma
asked
the
girl
evasively
and
turning
her
crimson
face
away
from
her
mother
keen
scrutiny
you
see
he
writes
himself
unknown
well
known
or
unknown
here
is
an
end
to
foolishness
said
lyle
crossing
the
room
and
tossing
the
luckless
flowers
out
of
the
window
i
did
not
know
you
were
so
silly
and
romantic
queenie
as
to
carry
a
bunch
of
dead
flowers
to
europe
queenie
stamped
her
little
foot
on
the
floor
and
her
eyes
flashed
fire
mamma
you
had
no
right
to
throw
my
flowers
away
she
passionately
exclaimed
papa
would
never
have
intermeddled
with
my
affairs
like
that
lyle
dropped
into
a
chair
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
to
think
that
i
should
have
a
child
that
would
treat
me
so
disrespectfully
she
sighed
what
has
mamma
been
doing
to
my
little
pet
asked
lyle
entering
quietly
and
unexpectedly
as
he
always
did
there
was
an
awkward
silence
for
a
moment
then
queenie
said
with
her
sweet
face
turned
away
mamma
has
been
scolding
me
because
i
would
not
marry
captain
ernscliffe
your
papa
would
do
well
to
scold
you
also
flashed
lyle
after
all
your
father
goodness
to
you
and
your
pretense
of
loving
him
so
well
to
think
that
you
would
throw
away
your
chance
of
helping
him
in
his
old
age
i
have
no
patience
with
such
folly
papa
are
not
angry
with
me
are
you
asked
his
daughter
turning
her
soft
beseeching
eyes
now
swimming
in
tears
upon
his
kind
yet
troubled
face
i
could
not
marry
captain
ernscliffe
papa
because
i
do
not
love
him
love
sneered
lyle
scornfully
love
is
the
last
thing
to
be
considered
nowadays
papa
drew
the
tearful
pleader
down
by
his
side
on
the
lounge
and
smoothed
away
the
disheveled
golden
ringlets
from
the
flushed
little
face
no
dear
i
am
not
angry
with
you
he
said
it
is
true
that
my
business
affairs
are
tottering
on
the
verge
of
failure
and
if
you
had
accepted
the
captain
he
might
have
helped
me
to
tide
over
the
crisis
but
i
would
not
have
you
sacrifice
yourself
my
pet
for
i
would
be
loth
to
part
from
you
even
if
you
went
willingly
and
happily
to
another
home
but
let
us
hope
for
the
best
now
that
your
uncle
rob
is
about
to
take
my
expensive
family
off
my
hands
for
a
year
i
may
be
able
to
save
some
money
and
get
straight
again
three
days
later
lyle
and
her
three
fair
and
charming
daughters
stood
on
the
deck
of
the
bound
for
their
long
and
anxiously
anticipated
continental
tour
chapter
how
i
miss
them
all
lyle
said
to
himself
often
and
often
in
the
long
year
while
his
family
were
absent
and
he
went
home
every
night
to
his
solitary
supper
and
lonely
newspaper
i
would
give
anything
to
see
my
little
queenie
or
even
to
get
a
letter
from
her
strange
that
she
does
not
write
to
me
and
mamma
too
in
her
brief
letters
never
says
a
word
about
queenie
though
she
must
know
that
i
want
to
hear
something
about
my
little
one
she
always
says
that
the
girls
are
well
and
enjoying
themselves
but
she
never
goes
into
particulars
it
was
quite
true
the
lyles
were
traveling
from
place
to
place
and
lyle
never
fond
of
writing
always
dropped
the
briefest
of
notes
to
her
husband
and
invariably
informed
him
that
he
need
not
reply
for
they
were
constantly
on
the
wing
and
could
not
tell
him
where
to
direct
his
letter
so
that
it
would
reach
them
she
spoke
of
the
girls
casually
never
naming
them
in
particular
save
once
in
her
first
letter
when
she
said
that
robert
was
much
disappointed
and
even
vexed
at
defection
lyle
puzzled
a
great
deal
over
those
words
at
first
and
at
last
concluded
that
lyle
referred
to
queenie
rejection
of
captain
ernscliffe
robert
lyle
was
a
younger
brother
of
lyle
and
had
inherited
a
large
fortune
from
a
deceased
uncle
he
was
an
invalid
and
spent
most
of
his
time
abroad
from
whence
many
fine
presents
found
their
way
to
his
elder
brother
family
in
america
lyle
felt
rather
vexed
that
robert
should
have
blamed
little
queenie
for
her
course
in
regard
to
captain
ernscliffe
the
child
is
too
young
to
be
forced
into
a
loveless
marriage
he
said
to
himself
i
hope
she
will
marry
money
some
day
for
i
know
how
sad
the
lack
of
it
is
but
i
hope
it
may
be
a
too
the
longing
for
his
little
girl
was
very
strong
upon
him
one
night
as
he
sat
in
his
quiet
library
trying
to
interest
himself
in
the
daily
paper
so
strong
that
he
laid
the
paper
down
and
rested
his
head
a
little
wearily
on
his
hands
it
is
six
months
since
they
went
away
he
said
how
long
it
seems
and
how
much
i
want
to
see
my
little
queenie
it
is
strange
but
ever
since
she
was
born
i
have
loved
her
better
than
the
other
children
something
like
a
quivering
sigh
sounded
faintly
through
the
room
he
looked
up
quickly
but
he
was
quite
alone
i
am
growing
fanciful
in
my
old
age
and
solitude
he
thought
and
dropped
his
head
again
upon
his
hands
again
that
soft
low
sigh
went
trembling
through
the
room
this
time
some
strange
instinct
drew
his
eyes
to
the
window
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
smothered
cry
a
sweet
white
face
framed
in
golden
hair
was
pressed
against
the
looking
at
him
with
dark
eyes
full
of
love
and
sorrow
the
beautiful
face
of
his
absent
daughter
queenie
she
has
come
home
my
darling
he
cried
joyfully
and
rushed
to
the
window
and
threw
up
the
sash
but
in
that
moment
the
lovely
young
face
had
disappeared
queenie
my
love
where
are
you
he
called
do
not
tease
your
poor
old
papa
but
silence
and
darkness
answered
him
only
he
went
out
into
the
garden
and
wandered
about
in
the
shrubbery
calling
softly
queenie
queenie
but
echo
only
answered
him
he
went
back
sadly
into
the
house
and
thought
over
the
perplexing
mystery
she
is
dead
he
said
at
last
i
have
seen
her
spirit
she
has
come
to
me
from
foreign
lands
to
bid
me
an
eternal
farewell
oh
queenie
queenie
my
lost
darling
and
from
that
night
lyle
began
to
grow
old
and
broken
he
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
nor
rest
until
he
heard
from
his
wife
again
in
a
month
one
of
her
short
careless
epistles
came
to
hand
she
said
as
usual
that
the
girls
were
well
and
enjoying
themselves
very
much
and
added
that
georgina
had
caught
a
beau
and
was
apt
to
make
a
splendid
match
she
is
living
then
my
little
pet
exclaimed
the
doting
old
father
in
delighted
surprise
and
yet
i
surely
saw
her
spirit
face
looking
in
upon
me
that
night
it
was
a
warning
or
a
token
of
sorrow
and
the
burden
of
heaviness
still
clung
about
his
heart
and
the
shadow
brooded
in
his
kindly
blue
eyes
until
lyle
wrote
at
last
that
they
were
coming
home
on
the
the
next
month
it
was
a
dark
and
stormy
night
when
the
lyles
came
home
again
lyle
had
not
known
when
the
would
be
in
so
they
took
him
by
surprise
when
they
drove
up
to
the
door
that
night
it
was
verging
on
to
midnight
and
the
domestics
were
all
asleep
but
lyle
was
still
up
poring
over
an
account
book
this
is
a
joyful
surprise
he
exclaimed
as
he
led
the
way
to
the
and
turned
up
the
gas
that
he
might
look
at
their
sweet
faces
clearly
lyle
fell
on
his
neck
and
embraced
him
and
sydney
then
georgina
glided
forward
and
touched
his
cheek
with
their
lips
he
looked
behind
them
for
the
little
one
whom
he
had
thought
would
be
first
to
embrace
him
queenie
where
is
queenie
he
asked
lyle
slowly
drawing
off
her
gray
kid
gloves
looked
at
him
in
some
surprise
bless
the
darling
is
she
not
asleep
she
said
it
was
so
late
and
stormy
that
we
expected
you
would
all
be
in
bed
and
asleep
the
rain
beat
dismally
outside
the
wind
howled
like
a
demon
in
despair
something
of
the
chill
and
coldness
outside
seemed
to
strike
to
the
man
heart
as
he
said
quickly
the
servants
are
all
asleep
but
queenie
she
is
with
you
of
course
why
do
you
say
papa
said
sydney
did
queenie
come
down
to
the
steamer
to
meet
us
in
this
dreadful
storm
lyle
looked
bewildered
sydney
he
exclaimed
hoarsely
did
not
queenie
come
home
with
you
from
europe
why
papa
queenie
did
not
go
with
us
you
know
said
georgina
coming
forward
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
she
came
back
to
stay
with
you
is
she
not
at
home
lyle
dropped
back
into
a
chair
and
wrung
his
hands
like
one
distracted
my
god
he
exclaimed
you
torture
me
with
your
inexplicable
words
i
tell
you
i
have
never
laid
eyes
on
queenie
living
since
i
bade
her
on
the
deck
of
the
a
year
ago
my
god
screamed
lyle
falling
down
upon
the
floor
while
sydney
and
georgina
looked
like
statues
of
horror
what
has
become
of
my
little
queenie
papa
said
sydney
in
a
trembling
voice
there
is
some
dreadful
mystery
here
queenie
did
not
go
to
europe
with
us
after
you
bade
us
that
day
on
the
steamer
she
cried
and
wept
and
almost
went
into
hysterics
begging
mamma
to
let
her
go
back
and
stay
with
you
instead
of
going
to
europe
she
was
so
unmanageable
that
mamma
consented
at
last
and
she
and
her
trunks
were
put
on
shore
and
we
went
aboard
without
her
did
she
not
come
home
to
you
no
never
groaned
the
wretched
father
like
one
demented
i
have
never
seen
her
since
that
day
oh
queenie
my
lost
darling
where
are
you
for
a
moment
there
came
no
answer
to
the
question
they
stood
around
spellbound
with
horror
while
a
peal
of
awful
thunder
reverberated
outside
and
seemed
to
shake
the
house
from
its
foundations
the
next
moment
the
door
was
burst
violently
open
and
the
dripping
figure
of
a
woman
rushed
into
the
room
burst
from
the
quivering
lips
of
the
unhappy
father
yes
it
was
queenie
but
oh
how
terribly
changed
her
streaming
golden
hair
matted
with
mold
and
dead
leaves
hung
wet
and
cold
over
her
shoulders
her
dress
of
dark
silk
was
stained
with
great
patches
and
wisps
of
dead
autumn
leaves
the
tight
bodice
open
at
the
top
exposed
her
throat
which
oh
heaven
was
marked
round
and
round
with
the
purple
and
red
print
of
as
though
she
had
been
strangled
her
face
was
white
as
death
showing
the
plainer
for
its
whiteness
a
mark
upon
her
brow
above
her
eyes
the
horrible
purple
print
of
a
boot
heel
on
the
tender
flesh
from
which
a
thin
stream
of
blood
trickled
down
on
her
ghastly
face
a
fearful
fearful
apparition
strangely
unlike
little
queenie
of
other
days
yet
it
was
queenie
for
she
staggered
blindly
forward
and
panting
out
papa
papa
forgive
fell
in
a
lifeless
heap
at
his
feet
chapter
vi
at
little
queenie
sudden
and
terrible
appearance
lyle
and
the
two
elder
sisters
screamed
aloud
in
fright
and
horror
and
even
the
agonized
father
recoiled
a
moment
from
the
creature
that
lay
at
his
feet
to
all
appearances
dead
directly
however
with
a
strong
revulsion
of
feeling
from
dismay
and
terror
to
pity
and
tenderness
he
bent
down
and
lifted
the
white
face
of
his
daughter
on
his
arm
her
head
fell
back
helplessly
and
the
wet
and
matted
locks
of
gold
trailed
over
the
velvet
carpet
drenching
it
with
the
long
dark
lashes
lay
close
upon
the
cheeks
and
no
breath
fluttered
over
the
pale
parted
lips
to
show
that
life
still
dwelt
in
the
frame
of
the
hapless
girl
a
cry
of
agony
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
poor
father
whose
fondest
affections
had
been
concentrated
on
the
daughter
now
lying
lifeless
in
his
arms
oh
god
oh
god
what
fearful
mystery
is
here
queenie
is
and
oh
those
marks
upon
her
throat
and
brow
someone
has
my
little
darling
again
the
frightened
shrieks
of
the
women
rose
above
the
dreadful
tumult
of
the
storm
outside
they
huddled
together
by
the
marble
hearth
shuddering
as
though
afraid
to
approach
that
object
that
had
come
upon
them
with
the
face
of
the
little
queenie
they
had
alternately
scolded
and
petted
in
the
past
lyle
looked
at
them
with
a
keen
reproach
and
pain
in
his
heavy
eyes
queenie
is
he
said
to
them
in
a
hollow
broken
voice
why
do
you
stand
aloof
from
her
his
lips
were
white
and
he
trembled
so
that
he
could
scarcely
hold
the
still
form
that
lay
so
helpless
in
his
arms
but
even
as
he
spoke
her
lips
parted
in
a
faint
and
scarce
audible
sigh
the
eyelids
fluttered
slightly
and
grew
still
again
no
no
she
he
cried
rapturously
quick
quick
let
us
take
her
to
her
room
and
apply
restoratives
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
the
women
mechanically
followed
him
as
he
bore
her
to
her
room
and
laid
her
down
upon
her
little
white
bed
then
he
turned
around
with
the
dazed
look
gone
from
his
white
face
and
a
gleam
of
resolution
there
instead
there
is
some
dreadful
mystery
here
he
said
in
deep
low
tones
the
servants
must
not
know
of
this
let
them
think
that
she
came
back
with
you
from
europe
sydney
and
georgie
you
may
retire
to
your
rooms
your
mamma
and
i
will
do
all
that
is
necessary
frightened
and
weeping
the
girls
went
away
to
their
rooms
and
the
fearfully
stricken
parents
went
to
work
to
restore
life
in
the
exhausted
frame
of
poor
little
queenie
they
bathed
and
dressed
the
wound
upon
her
brow
laved
the
fearfully
discolored
throat
with
arnica
wrung
and
dried
the
dripping
golden
tresses
and
lastly
lyle
removed
her
soiled
wet
garments
and
robed
her
in
a
pretty
nightdress
all
the
while
the
hapless
girl
lay
still
and
motionless
without
a
sign
of
life
save
an
occasional
quiver
of
the
eyelids
and
a
faint
scarce
perceptible
throbbing
in
her
wrist
my
dear
you
are
tired
and
overcome
lyle
said
to
his
wife
when
they
had
done
all
that
was
possible
go
to
your
room
and
rest
i
will
stay
here
and
watch
by
our
little
girl
lyle
leaned
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
burst
into
hysterical
weeping
oh
what
does
it
mean
she
moaned
wringing
her
hands
oh
has
queenie
been
this
past
year
my
dear
we
shall
know
when
she
revives
if
she
ever
does
go
now
and
rest
he
answered
pushing
her
gently
from
the
room
he
went
back
to
his
lonely
vigil
and
watched
the
weary
night
through
by
that
silent
form
upon
the
bed
now
and
then
he
rose
and
poured
a
few
drops
of
wine
between
the
pale
unconscious
lips
and
sat
down
again
with
his
finger
upon
the
fluttering
pulse
at
length
between
the
dark
and
the
dawn
queenie
opened
her
eyes
upon
his
face
sighed
and
murmured
papa
he
bent
over
her
anxiously
you
are
better
darling
he
said
i
am
better
she
answered
faintly
there
was
silence
a
little
while
after
that
she
lay
quite
still
with
her
large
hollow
eyes
fixed
wistfully
on
her
father
pale
and
troubled
face
as
he
bent
over
her
holding
her
white
and
wasted
hand
in
both
his
own
everything
was
very
still
about
the
house
the
storm
outside
had
spent
itself
and
only
now
and
then
the
fitful
muttering
of
the
homeless
wind
reminded
one
of
the
war
of
the
elements
that
had
raged
so
fiercely
a
few
hours
ago
lyle
voice
hoarse
trembling
agonized
broke
strangely
upon
the
utter
stillness
where
have
you
been
all
this
long
dreadful
year
queenie
turned
her
face
and
buried
it
in
the
pillow
and
a
low
sob
of
utter
agony
answered
him
only
again
he
repeated
the
question
this
time
more
firmly
and
resolutely
oh
papa
i
tell
you
she
moaned
without
lifting
her
face
from
its
friendly
refuge
yes
queenie
i
must
have
a
full
explanation
of
your
mysterious
absence
for
i
fear
it
covers
wrong
or
guilt
secrecy
is
seldom
without
sin
he
answered
in
a
firm
but
voice
his
daughter
wrung
her
white
hands
moaning
and
weeping
oh
papa
i
tell
you
she
exclaimed
lyle
took
the
white
hands
that
were
wildly
beating
the
air
and
held
them
firmly
in
both
his
own
be
calm
queenie
he
said
and
listen
to
me
there
can
be
no
question
of
between
you
and
me
you
have
deceived
us
all
and
spent
a
year
away
from
us
you
return
to
us
wretched
and
alone
with
the
marks
of
cruel
violence
upon
your
person
what
are
we
to
think
of
you
queenie
if
you
refuse
to
explain
the
mystery
how
can
we
receive
you
back
with
a
secret
perhaps
a
shameful
one
in
your
life
i
must
have
your
vindication
from
your
own
lips
my
poor
child
answer
me
queenie
where
have
you
spent
this
missing
year
of
your
life
she
wrenched
her
hands
away
and
looked
about
her
wildly
let
me
go
i
can
not
stay
here
oh
why
did
i
ever
come
she
wailed
i
was
mad
mad
he
laid
her
forcibly
back
upon
the
bed
she
was
too
weak
to
resist
him
and
lay
panting
and
moaning
in
wild
despair
queenie
you
torture
me
he
said
hoarsely
i
must
have
the
truth
from
you
tell
me
dear
has
anyone
wronged
you
if
it
is
so
i
will
have
the
villain
heart
blood
she
shivered
and
trembled
where
she
lay
held
down
by
his
strong
hands
too
late
she
moaned
in
a
voice
i
have
taken
vengeance
into
my
own
hands
i
have
she
broke
off
shivering
and
sobbing
with
a
look
of
awful
horror
in
the
white
face
with
the
terrible
purple
print
of
a
on
the
marble
brow
tell
me
all
dear
he
said
his
voice
sharp
with
anxiety
and
foreboding
she
looked
up
trembling
and
shivering
and
wailed
out
papa
be
merciful
spare
me
spare
me
he
made
no
answer
his
head
was
bowed
on
his
hands
his
face
hidden
queenie
looked
at
him
and
saw
with
a
sudden
sharp
pang
how
strangely
his
clustering
locks
had
whitened
in
the
past
year
she
raised
herself
up
and
threw
her
arms
around
him
laying
her
cheek
against
his
shoulder
papa
she
whispered
mournfully
look
up
i
will
tell
you
all
but
only
to
you
dearest
and
best
of
fathers
can
i
reveal
the
secret
that
has
ruined
my
life
with
her
cheek
against
his
shoulder
and
her
hand
locked
in
his
queenie
lyle
poured
forth
in
burning
words
the
story
of
that
missing
year
the
saddest
story
to
which
her
father
had
ever
listened
yet
he
made
no
comment
uttered
no
word
until
she
had
finished
and
thrown
herself
down
at
his
feet
with
the
wailing
cry
papa
can
you
forgive
me
he
did
not
try
to
lift
her
up
as
she
lay
there
he
only
said
in
a
deep
intense
voice
with
a
lightning
flash
in
his
deep
eyes
queenie
you
have
forgotten
to
tell
me
one
thing
she
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
papa
it
is
the
only
thing
i
must
keep
from
you
that
hated
name
what
matters
it
is
he
not
beyond
the
reach
of
your
vengeance
true
true
he
answered
with
a
strong
shudder
oh
queenie
my
poor
child
would
to
god
i
had
died
before
this
terrible
thing
came
upon
me
she
crept
nearer
him
and
rested
her
bowed
head
on
his
knee
all
her
glorious
golden
tresses
sweeping
to
the
floor
his
heart
ached
as
he
saw
that
bright
head
lying
there
bowed
low
with
shame
and
disgrace
papa
she
whispered
in
a
voice
like
saddest
music
papa
do
you
me
he
was
silent
a
moment
struggling
with
the
keenest
agony
he
had
ever
known
then
he
answered
very
gently
my
poor
queenie
i
forgive
you
then
added
in
the
words
of
the
great
teacher
of
men
let
him
that
is
without
sin
cast
the
first
stone
and
the
first
beams
of
the
newly
risen
day
shone
into
the
room
and
crowned
his
gray
head
like
a
halo
of
light
chapter
vii
yes
queenie
was
quite
sick
for
more
than
a
month
after
we
returned
from
abroad
she
is
not
strong
yet
but
she
has
promised
to
come
down
into
the
for
a
little
while
this
evening
it
was
lyle
who
spoke
in
the
calmest
most
composed
tone
in
the
world
she
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
richly
dressed
in
silk
and
lace
and
fluttering
her
fan
as
she
talked
to
captain
ernscliffe
who
leaned
over
the
back
of
her
chair
tall
handsome
and
stately
the
most
man
in
the
room
lyle
was
giving
a
small
reception
after
her
return
and
had
bidden
the
de
la
of
society
only
to
welcome
her
home
there
were
beautiful
women
in
plenty
present
and
none
but
had
a
flattering
smile
for
captain
ernscliffe
but
though
he
smiled
and
chatted
with
all
he
still
kept
looking
over
even
the
fairest
heads
toward
the
door
for
one
absent
face
while
his
heart
thrilled
with
anxiety
and
expectation
she
came
at
last
and
though
he
had
been
watching
for
her
so
long
he
scarcely
knew
her
when
she
entered
he
had
expected
to
see
a
little
creature
with
a
sunny
smile
and
falling
ringlets
and
cheeks
like
pinkest
rose
leaves
instead
there
entered
a
tall
pale
graceful
girl
clad
in
a
dress
of
white
lace
ornamented
with
knots
of
purple
pansies
the
crimson
lips
were
set
in
a
proud
curve
instead
of
a
smile
and
the
dark
fringe
of
her
lashes
swept
so
low
that
they
almost
shadowed
her
cheeks
her
golden
hair
was
confined
in
a
thick
braid
and
wound
about
her
head
like
a
coronet
making
her
seem
as
stately
as
a
young
princess
she
was
changed
greatly
changed
from
a
year
ago
and
yet
none
who
looked
at
the
fair
calm
face
with
pride
sitting
regnant
on
the
broad
white
brow
would
have
dreamed
that
the
pathos
and
pain
of
a
terrible
tragedy
had
been
wrought
into
her
life
and
had
seared
her
heart
and
soul
as
with
fire
friends
and
acquaintances
crowded
around
her
and
it
was
many
minutes
before
she
found
her
way
to
her
mother
chair
where
captain
ernscliffe
still
stood
with
his
heart
beating
so
fast
that
he
thought
she
must
have
heard
it
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
everyone
in
the
room
must
read
in
his
face
the
secret
of
his
love
for
queenie
lyle
who
had
rejected
him
a
year
ago
with
all
the
thoughtless
lightness
of
girlhood
but
no
his
face
was
perfectly
calm
to
all
appearance
and
as
the
girl
gave
one
timid
upward
glance
at
him
she
thought
he
had
forgotten
or
outlived
the
pain
of
his
rejection
i
scarcely
dared
hope
that
you
would
return
home
as
you
went
he
said
after
the
first
formal
greeting
i
feared
some
french
count
or
english
lord
would
claim
you
as
his
own
she
blushed
and
her
eyes
fell
until
the
dark
lashes
rested
on
her
burning
cheeks
i
was
not
so
fortunate
as
to
claim
the
admiration
of
any
of
the
nobility
she
answered
carelessly
georgie
outshone
us
all
she
is
to
be
married
to
an
english
lord
in
a
month
from
now
i
am
very
glad
it
is
not
you
who
are
to
be
married
to
him
he
answered
laughing
but
with
an
undertone
of
sincerity
other
friends
claimed
her
for
awhile
but
his
restless
glance
found
her
out
sitting
by
a
window
alone
for
the
moment
and
looking
tired
and
a
little
sad
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
stand
the
heat
of
the
rooms
he
said
kindly
come
out
in
the
garden
and
walk
in
the
moonlight
with
me
she
took
his
arm
and
they
went
out
in
the
garden
it
was
summer
and
the
flowers
were
blooming
in
profuse
sweetness
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
odor
of
the
roses
and
honeysuckle
they
sat
down
upon
a
rustic
seat
with
the
full
flood
of
brilliant
moonlight
falling
on
queenie
uncovered
head
and
lovely
white
face
you
have
grown
more
beautiful
than
ever
queenie
said
her
companion
admiringly
she
did
not
answer
but
he
fancied
that
he
heard
a
faint
quickly
smothered
sigh
impulsively
he
took
into
his
own
the
small
hand
lying
cold
and
listless
in
her
lap
it
has
been
a
year
since
i
saw
you
queenie
he
exclaimed
but
i
find
the
old
love
rising
in
my
heart
as
passionately
as
if
we
had
only
parted
yesterday
dearest
have
you
ever
repented
of
your
cruelty
to
me
she
looked
up
at
him
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
a
fathomless
sadness
and
vague
regret
ah
yes
she
said
and
her
voice
was
almost
a
wail
of
pain
i
have
repented
captain
ernscliffe
i
have
been
sorry
often
and
often
for
my
blind
mistake
he
held
out
his
arms
drawing
he
scarcely
knew
what
hope
from
her
agitated
words
queenie
come
to
me
he
cried
let
atonement
follow
repentance
but
she
drew
back
trembling
and
frightened
i
oh
i
did
not
mean
that
she
said
i
can
not
is
too
late
queenie
do
not
be
cruel
to
me
again
he
pleaded
carried
away
by
the
rush
of
his
wild
passion
if
you
knew
how
i
have
wearied
for
you
since
you
went
away
how
blank
my
life
has
been
you
could
not
be
so
cruel
you
would
give
yourself
to
me
out
of
sheer
pity
and
tenderness
but
i
do
not
love
you
she
said
i
will
teach
you
to
love
me
queenie
i
love
you
so
well
that
i
could
not
help
winning
your
love
in
return
if
you
only
gave
me
the
privilege
to
try
say
yes
my
beautiful
darling
and
make
me
the
happiest
of
men
she
sat
still
with
her
head
bowed
and
her
hands
locked
together
in
her
lap
like
one
thinking
intently
at
length
she
said
without
lifting
her
head
to
look
at
him
i
do
not
believe
i
can
make
you
happy
captain
ernscliffe
but
i
will
be
your
wife
if
you
want
me
when
the
reception
was
over
and
the
guests
all
gone
queenie
sought
her
father
and
found
him
alone
in
the
library
papa
she
said
abruptly
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
captain
ernscliffe
has
proposed
to
me
again
you
refused
him
of
course
queenie
he
answered
looking
at
her
with
the
grave
sadness
that
always
rested
on
his
features
now
her
eyes
fell
and
a
crimson
flush
crept
slowly
over
her
features
but
she
answered
steadily
papa
i
have
accepted
him
queenie
papa
why
have
you
acted
thus
you
do
not
love
him
no
papa
but
it
will
be
a
fine
match
for
me
she
answered
with
a
hard
little
laugh
and
a
slight
ring
of
sarcasm
in
her
voice
he
looked
at
her
almost
angrily
queenie
i
have
never
intended

contemplated
the
possibility
of
a
marriage
for
you
since
since
you
came
back
home
i
took
you
back
and
forgave
you
kept
your
secret
and
forced
your
mother
and
sisters
to
receive
you
and
overlook
that
dreadful
blank
year
whose
secret
i
would
not
reveal
to
them
but
i
can
not
you
must
not
expect
it
allow
you
to
deceive
an
honest
man
oh
papa
papa
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
looked
up
at
him
imploringly
for
sweet
pity
sake
have
mercy
on
me
keep
my
secret
and
let
me
marry
captain
ernscliffe
i
need
another
home
mamma
and
the
girls
are
so
cold
and
hard
to
me
i
will
be
a
good
wife
to
him
i
will
indeed
he
shall
never
know
ah
queenie
if
your
sin
should
find
you
out
he
said
it
will
not
it
she
said
with
a
shudder
it
is
buried
and
i
have
prayed
oh
how
i
have
prayed
papa
and
god
has
forgiven
me
god
has
forgiven
you
but
would
not
he
said
forgave
me
papa
because
you
had
been
sinned
against
and
because
i
love
you
so
dearly
and
pitied
you
also
but
queenie
captain
ernscliffe
would
recoil
from
you
in
horror
if
he
knew
what
i
know
papa
he
shall
know
she
cried
clasping
his
knees
with
her
round
white
arms
and
lifting
her
wild
streaming
eyes
to
his
face
i
will
try
to
make
him
happy
and
he
wants
me
so
very
much
you
will
only
make
him
unhappy
if
you
come
between
us
a
gleam
of
relenting
came
into
his
eyes
he
had
loved
her
so
dearly
even
since
her
innocent
babyhood
and
now
despite
her
fault
despite
the
hidden
tragedy
in
her
young
life
the
father
heart
bled
for
her
and
sweet
pity
stood
sentinel
over
her
past
queenie
do
you
think
you
are
doing
right
he
said
appealing
to
her
honor
alas
her
terrible
wrongs
and
deep
despair
had
steeled
her
heart
against
all
appeals
right
or
wrong
she
said
almost
defiantly
i
shall
marry
him
unless
you
tell
him
my
secret
papa
and
if
you
do
what
good
will
you
accomplish
you
will
only
break
his
heart
go
then
unhappy
willful
child
he
answered
sternly
go
but
if
shame
and
sorrow
come
of
your
folly
remember
the
fault
is
on
your
own
head
i
accept
the
responsibility
she
answered
with
a
hard
steely
ring
in
her
voice
he
turned
away
with
a
groan
and
went
abruptly
out
of
the
room
she
is
changed
almost
beyond
belief
he
said
to
himself
that
dreadful
tragedy
has
warped
her
whole
nature
and
made
her
reckless
and
heartless
unless
some
softening
influence
is
brought
to
bear
upon
her
she
will
be
lost
forever
queenie
was
about
to
leave
the
library
when
a
rustling
noise
made
her
look
around
and
the
next
moment
sydney
lyle
stepped
from
behind
the
heavy
curtains
at
the
window
where
she
had
been
an
unsuspected
listener
to
the
conversation
sydney
looked
brilliantly
beautiful
in
a
satin
trimmed
with
spanish
lace
a
cluster
of
rich
scarlet
roses
were
fastened
in
the
dark
braids
of
her
hair
and
diamonds
blazed
on
her
neck
and
arms
but
they
were
scarcely
brighter
than
the
fire
in
her
dark
eyes
as
she
seized
queenie
by
the
white
shoulder
and
shook
her
roughly
queenie
lyle
you
little
wretch
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
of
concentrated
rage
and
passion
how
dare
you
promise
to
marry
captain
ernscliffe
queenie
shook
herself
loose
from
the
cruel
grasp
that
had
left
ugly
red
marks
on
her
smooth
white
shoulder
and
answered
defiantly
what
business
is
that
of
yours
sydney
you
shall
not
marry
him
sydney
continued
passionately
you
are
not
fit
to
marry
any
man
but
i
care
not
whom
you
wed
so
that
it
be
not
captain
ernscliffe
i
shall
marry
no
other
answered
queenie
stung
into
defiance
by
sydney
overbearing
look
and
manner
i
shall
marry
captain
ernscliffe
as
surely
as
i
live
sydney
and
you
can
not
prevent
it
can
i
not
hissed
sydney
furiously
what
if
i
tell
him
to
ask
you
for
the
secret
of
that
of
your
life
queenie
looked
back
at
her
calmly
and
quietly
you
will
not
dare
to
do
it
she
said
if
you
did
i
would
tell
him
that
you
wanted
him
for
yourself
he
would
not
believe
you
flashed
sydney
you
dare
not
risk
it
sydney
said
queenie
defiantly
as
for
me
i
have
promised
to
marry
captain
ernscliffe
at
the
same
hour
that
georgina
marries
lord
valentine
and
i
shall
surely
keep
my
word
she
swept
from
the
room
without
pausing
to
listen
to
the
reply
of
her
infuriated
sister
chapter
viii
whether
sydney
lyle
was
frightened
or
not
by
her
sister
threat
she
made
no
effort
to
interfere
with
the
marriage
whose
appointed
day
was
swiftly
approaching
captain
ernscliffe
was
a
daily
visitor
at
lyle
but
sydney
kept
her
room
or
was
constantly
absorbed
in
fashionable
gayeties
so
that
she
saw
but
little
of
queenie
and
her
lover
but
though
sydney
had
apparently
given
up
the
contest
she
still
preserved
a
tacit
feud
with
queenie
refusing
to
speak
to
or
notice
her
in
any
way
and
haughtily
repelling
the
questions
and
remonstrances
of
the
family
on
the
subject
lord
valentine
the
lover
of
the
fair
georgina
at
length
arrived
and
the
cards
of
invitation
were
issued
for
the
double
wedding
which
lyle
had
determined
should
be
quite
a
brilliant
affair
lyle
was
jubilant
over
the
prospect
of
marrying
off
two
of
her
girls
so
advantageously
and
lyle
in
the
midst
of
his
trouble
and
anxiety
over
queenie
was
still
conscious
of
a
certain
sense
of
relief
for
there
had
been
a
coldness
and
estrangement
between
queenie
and
the
other
members
of
the
family
ever
since
her
return
and
the
atmosphere
of
home
had
seemed
charged
with
electricity
that
threatened
at
any
moment
to
burst
into
storm
so
that
none
except
perhaps
sydney
were
sorry
when
the
eventful
night
arrived
and
the
two
brides
were
dressing
in
their
respective
rooms
georgina
attended
by
her
mother
and
sydney
and
the
single
maid
employed
by
the
family
waiting
on
queenie
the
unhappy
girl
was
keenly
conscious
of
the
tacit
slight
but
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
by
word
or
sign
and
after
her
toilet
was
completed
she
sent
the
maid
away
saying
that
she
wished
to
be
alone
a
little
while
everything
is
perfect
she
said
surveying
herself
critically
in
the
mirror
i
am
a
shade
too
pale
but
then
they
allow
that
to
brides
i
believe
ah
me
she
walked
up
and
down
the
room
her
small
hands
locked
before
her
her
beautiful
face
as
white
as
death
a
look
of
deep
unrest
in
her
large
violet
eyes
there
was
a
slight
tap
at
the
door
she
knew
it
at
once
for
her
familiar
knock
enter
papa
she
said
he
turned
the
softly
and
came
in
i
have
come
to
see
if
the
bride
looks
pretty
he
said
veiling
his
emotion
under
an
affectation
of
lightness
you
are
the
only
one
who
cares
to
know
she
answered
with
a
ring
of
bitterness
in
her
sweet
voice
he
stood
silent
surveying
her
with
sad
yet
admiring
eyes
she
wore
the
rich
brocaded
silk
that
her
uncle
had
sent
her
a
year
ago
from
paris
and
which
she
had
laughingly
declared
then
should
be
her
its
rich
shining
folds
trailed
far
behind
her
and
the
soft
folds
of
the
bridal
veil
fell
over
it
like
a
mist
her
wreath
and
the
knots
of
flowers
that
looped
up
her
dress
were
of
natural
orange
blossoms
the
gift
of
her
lover
their
fragrance
pervaded
the
room
deliciously
she
wore
a
magnificent
set
of
diamonds
the
bridal
gift
of
captain
ernscliffe
young
beautiful
elegantly
attired
she
made
a
picture
on
which
the
eyes
might
feast
and
never
grow
weary
and
none
would
have
guessed
how
heavy
was
the
heart
beating
under
the
satin
corsage
or
that
the
fearful
elements
of
a
tragedy
had
been
woven
into
that
life
that
seemed
yet
in
its
earliest
spring
her
father
looked
at
her
a
moment
then
silently
opened
his
arms
and
she
as
silently
glided
into
them
heedless
that
the
bridal
veil
was
disarranged
as
she
laid
her
fair
head
down
upon
his
breast
papa
she
murmured
with
quivering
lips
love
me
you
are
kind
to
me
in
spite
of
of
all
god
bless
you
my
little
daughter
he
said
solemnly
and
touched
his
lips
lightly
to
her
brow
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
kissed
her
since
she
had
come
back
he
had
forgiven
her
and
been
kind
to
her
but
the
loving
caresses
that
had
been
showered
on
the
little
queenie
who
went
away
had
never
been
given
to
the
queenie
who
returned
this
silent
gentle
kiss
seemed
to
have
all
the
solemnity
of
a
farewell
papa
i
feel
strangely
she
said
putting
her
hands
to
her
brow
my
head
whirls
my
oh
oh
god
oh
god
what
is
that
with
a
wild
and
ringing
shriek
of
horror
she
tore
herself
from
his
arms
and
stood
pointing
at
the
window
with
one
jeweled
finger
her
blue
eyes
dark
and
dilated
her
face
transfigured
with
terror
that
frightened
shriek
penetrated
to
georgina
room
across
the
hall
the
bride
and
her
mother
and
sister
all
made
a
rush
for
queenie
room
apprehending
some
dire
calamity
they
found
her
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
her
face
transfigured
with
terror
her
shaking
finger
pointed
at
the
window
while
she
wailed
aloud
in
accents
of
remorse
and
despair
dead
the
dead
queenie
queenie
you
rave
her
father
exclaimed
catching
her
arm
as
she
held
it
forward
still
pointing
at
the
window
she
turned
around
and
clung
to
him
sobbing
wildly
a
ghost
was
there
papa
a
horrible
ghost
no
no
dear
there
was
nothing
i
saw
nothing
queenie
there
is
no
one
at
the
window
he
answered
soothingly
she
gave
a
fearful
shuddering
look
at
the
window
it
is
gone
now
papa
but
i
tell
you
i
saw
a
ghost
at
the
window
one
from
the
dead
came
and
looked
at
me
ghost
papa
she
moaned
hiding
her
face
on
his
shoulder
whose
ghost
was
it
queenie
asked
georgina
curiously
as
she
stepped
forward
in
her
elegant
bridal
robe
whom
did
you
see
do
not
tease
her
georgie
stand
back
and
give
her
air
see
she
is
about
to
faint
exclaimed
her
father
a
little
shortly
the
bride
stepped
back
with
a
murmur
of
discontent
she
thought
it
exceedingly
rude
in
her
father
to
snub
the
prospective
lady
valentine
oh
for
mercy
sake
queenie
exclaimed
lyle
rushing
forward
with
a
bottle
of
de
do
give
way
to
hysterical
fancies
now
when
it
is
almost
time
for
the
ceremony
to
begin
you
saw
nothing
at
the
window
but
the
moonlight
come
come
compose
yourself
your
toilet
will
be
totally
disarranged
she
fell
to
work
bathing
the
limp
nerveless
hands
and
cold
brow
of
the
girl
while
sydney
and
georgina
stood
coldly
aloof
the
bride
because
she
was
afraid
of
ruffling
her
delicate
plumage
and
sydney
because
she
would
not
have
lifted
a
finger
to
save
queenie
if
she
had
lain
dying
before
her
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
the
maid
rushed
in
oh
lyle
she
exclaimed
the
company
is
arriving
carriage
is
at
the
door
and
alden
and
mrs
howe
oh
dear
exclaimed
lyle
was
there
ever
such
a
not
a
soul
in
the
to
receive
them
sydney
you
must
go
down
i
can
not
leave
queenie
in
this
state
sydney
curled
her
lip
in
a
disdainful
smile
and
went
the
marriage
was
to
take
place
at
home
and
the
was
profusely
decorated
with
flowers
a
beautiful
arch
of
white
flowers
was
arranged
where
the
bridal
couples
were
to
stand
and
wreaths
and
bouquets
were
variously
disposed
about
the
room
sydney
in
the
white
heat
of
anger
that
filled
her
heart
felt
sick
and
faint
as
the
overpowering
fragrance
pervaded
her
senses
yet
she
had
to
stand
up
and
receive
the
guests
and
smile
and
talk
as
if
it
were
the
happiest
evening
she
had
ever
known
she
had
refused
to
become
one
of
the
bridesmaids
so
when
the
bridal
party
with
their
long
string
of
lovely
attendants
entered
the
room
and
stood
before
the
bishop
she
drew
back
into
an
obscure
corner
that
no
one
might
see
the
jealous
pain
and
hatred
in
her
heart
disfiguring
her
handsome
face
georgina
was
married
first
taking
precedence
of
queenie
by
virtue
of
her
own
four
years
seniority
and
her
betrothed
superior
rank
then
the
couple
stepped
quietly
back
and
captain
ernscliffe
and
his
bride
took
their
place
the
solemn
words
were
spoken
the
ring
slipped
over
her
slim
finger
and
they
turned
to
receive
the
congratulations
of
their
friends
one
of
the
servants
came
bowing
and
smiling
into
the
group
carrying
a
magnificent
bouquet
of
white
flowers
for
ernscliffe
he
said
presenting
it
with
the
compliments
of
a
friend
she
took
it
into
her
white
hand
with
a
faint
smile
it
is
rarely
beautiful
she
said
and
lifted
it
to
her
face
and
inhaled
the
strong
sweet
odor
of
the
costly
flowers
something
more
pungent
than
the
innocent
breath
of
the
flowers
entered
into
her
brain
as
she
inhaled
the
fragrant
incense
she
threw
up
her
hands
and
without
a
word
or
cry
the
smiling
bride
fell
lifeless
at
her
husband
feet
chapter
ix
no
one
suspected
the
agency
of
the
beautiful
and
odorous
bouquet
in
the
sudden
and
tragical
death
of
the
fair
young
bride
it
lay
upon
the
floor
where
it
had
fallen
when
she
fell
and
in
the
grief
and
excitement
of
the
moment
no
one
thought
of
picking
it
up
who
would
have
thought
that
death
could
lurk
in
the
fragrant
breath
of
so
beautiful
an
offering
so
the
lovely
destroyer
lay
unheeded
where
it
had
fallen
and
in
the
morning
it
was
removed
by
the
servants
who
saw
in
it
only
a
withered
bouquet
that
littered
the
rich
carpet
but
its
mission
was
accomplished
and
when
lawrence
ernscliffe
lifting
the
drooping
head
of
his
bride
he
saw
only
the
marble
mask
of
death
on
that
peerless
face
that
a
moment
ago
was
wreathed
in
smiles
but
he
could
not
believe
it
and
when
the
physician
who
was
hastily
summoned
gave
the
verdict
so
often
wrongly
given
in
cases
of
sudden
death
that
had
caused
the
calamity
the
groan
of
agony
that
broke
from
the
strong
man
lips
was
she
can
not
be
he
cried
falling
on
his
knees
and
clasping
the
beautiful
form
to
his
heart
oh
god
give
her
back
to
me
my
darling
my
own
queenie
my
little
pet
my
precious
child
speak
to
me
cried
the
old
father
bending
over
her
in
agony
my
daughter
oh
my
daughter
shrieked
the
mother
and
georgina
wailed
aloud
both
of
them
forgetting
their
coldness
and
estrangement
and
remembering
only
the
little
queenie
they
had
loved
and
petted
and
teased
so
long
ago
and
who
now
was
dead
alas
they
might
have
stood
aloof
as
silent
and
as
cold
as
sydney
stood
for
all
the
answer
they
won
from
those
pale
lips
that
the
bridegroom
kissed
so
passionately
as
though
those
agonized
caresses
could
have
beguiled
her
back
to
life
and
love
again
one
by
one
the
bridal
guests
stole
away
and
left
them
alone
with
their
dead
the
silent
domestics
crept
about
closing
windows
and
doors
and
dimming
the
brilliant
lights
the
banquet
stood
untasted
under
the
glitter
of
flowers
and
lights
and
silver
the
music
was
hushed
the
garlands
drooped
low
and
the
house
of
feasting
was
turned
into
the
house
of
mourning
the
fairest
daughter
of
the
house
of
lyle
lay
dead
lyle
fell
down
in
a
fit
after
the
dreadful
certainty
of
his
loss
became
manifest
to
him
he
was
removed
to
his
chamber
attended
by
skillful
physicians
but
their
potent
art
was
of
no
avail
entire
consciousness
never
returned
to
him
again
he
lay
through
the
long
hours
of
the
night
tossing
restlessly
on
his
pillow
and
babbling
of
the
dead
girl
who
lay
in
the
chamber
above
deaf
to
his
agonized
appeals
as
to
those
of
her
they
thought
he
was
delirious
he
talked
so
strangely
i
knew
she
would
die
he
said
her
spirit
face
came
and
looked
at
me
through
the
window
one
night
it
was
when
she
was
away
a
shudder
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
i
knew
it
was
a
token
of
her
death
ah
but
i
forget
did
she
not
tell
me
it
was
herself
that
came
full
of
love
and
pity
and
sorrow
and
looked
at
her
poor
papa
sitting
lonely
for
lack
of
his
little
girl
queenie
queenie
where
are
you
come
back
dear
papa
forgives
you
he
will
take
you
home
again
out
of
the
cold
and
wet
and
the
dark
stormy
night
he
started
up
and
held
out
his
arms
to
clasp
her
to
his
heart
but
instead
he
encountered
the
form
of
the
bereaved
bridegroom
who
sat
by
the
side
of
his
bed
they
had
persuaded
nay
almost
forced
him
away
from
the
side
of
the
dead
bride
to
the
relief
of
the
suffering
living
he
sat
there
half
dazed
with
grief
and
horror
hearing
dreamily
the
strange
ravings
of
his
ravings
that
he
scarcely
heeded
then
but
which
burned
themselves
into
his
memory
and
were
recalled
in
after
years
with
inexpressible
pain
ah
ernscliffe
it
is
you
said
the
poor
father
when
the
yearning
arms
that
sought
for
queenie
touched
him
instead
are
you
waiting
for
her
too
you
must
not
blame
her
very
much
she
was
very
young
and
temptation
found
her
an
innocent
victim
you
remember
the
woman
in
the
bible
who
was
forgiven
much
because
she
loved
much
ernscliffe
you
will
not
be
hard
upon
little
queenie
you
will
forgive
her
for
she
also
loved
much
the
physician
tapped
his
forehead
significantly
with
his
forefinger
do
not
heed
him
he
raves
he
said
queenie
queenie
called
the
poor
sufferer
come
back
dear
i
forgive
you
but
you
must
ask
god
to
forgive
you
too
get
your
bible
pet
read
what
christ
said
sydney
standing
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
looked
strangely
at
her
mother
the
dying
man
as
his
restless
glance
roved
about
saw
that
look
and
beckoned
her
with
a
warning
finger
come
nearer
sydney
you
were
cold
and
hard
to
her
when
she
came
home
you
and
mamma
and
georgie
women
are
always
hard
to
each
other
how
could
you
be
so
cruel
to
the
little
one
he
paused
a
moment
as
if
for
reply
but
sydney
turned
her
pale
changeless
face
aside
and
lyle
was
sobbing
too
wildly
for
words
he
went
on
babbling
to
himself
on
the
one
theme
that
held
his
thoughts
she
was
such
a
sweet
child
was
she
not
mamma
so
lovely
and
so
loving
i
can
see
her
now
with
her
golden
curls
flying
on
the
breeze
and
her
light
feet
dancing
over
the
turf
little
goldilocks
we
used
to
call
her
sometimes
goldilocks
goldilocks
come
and
kiss
me
papa
forgives
you
georgina
who
had
stood
apart
weeping
against
lord
valentine
shoulder
came
forward
and
fell
on
her
knees
by
the
bed
thrilled
to
the
heart
by
the
tender
recollections
his
words
awoke
oh
papa
papa
she
sobbed
poor
little
queenie
he
reached
out
and
laid
one
trembling
hand
on
the
fair
head
still
crowned
with
the
orange
wreath
his
words
though
they
seemed
to
the
physicians
but
the
purposeless
ravings
of
a
disordered
fancy
burnt
themselves
upon
her
memory
as
if
written
in
fire
georgie
forgive
her
she
was
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
and
she
went
mad
and
avenged
the
wrongs
remember
that
when
she
comes
back
queenie
is
papa
sobbed
lady
valentine
dead
who
said
that
queenie
is
dead
he
asked
looking
vacantly
about
him
the
physician
came
forward
and
forced
a
composing
draught
upon
him
do
the
vagaries
of
illness
often
assume
such
forms
as
this
inquired
sydney
clear
voice
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
where
she
stood
supporting
the
form
of
her
hysterical
mother
as
what
miss
inquired
the
physician
politely
these
strange
and
dreadful
fancies
about
about
my
sister
she
answered
flushing
slightly
his
words
if
would
imply
so
much
but
taken
as
the
ravings
of
a
disordered
fancy
they
imply
nothing
answered
he
quickly
he
is
not
conscious
of
what
he
says
the
shock
of
your
sister
sudden
death
has
simply
assumed
some
other
form
to
his
delirious
brain
who
can
fathom
the
mysterious
workings
of
a
mind
diseased
sydney
glanced
furtively
across
at
captain
ernscliffe
he
was
listening
and
his
heavy
gaze
met
her
strange
inscrutable
one
do
not
distress
yourself
sydney
he
said
very
gently
it
is
only
the
raving
of
a
mind
distraught
of
course
we
know
that
our
lost
darling
his
voice
broke
and
quivered
over
the
words
and
he
paused
a
moment
and
repeated
them
of
course
we
know
that
our
lost
darling
was
as
pure
as
the
snow
she
never
could
have
sinned
who
says
that
she
sinned
exclaimed
lyle
rousing
slightly
from
the
stupor
stealing
over
him
who
says
that
she
sinned
let
him
among
you
that
is
without
sin
cast
the
first
stone
he
fell
back
exhausted
on
his
pillow
and
never
spoke
again
with
the
first
faint
glimmer
of
the
dawn
the
flickering
spark
of
his
life
went
out
went
out
so
gently
that
they
could
scarcely
tell
what
moment
the
soul
was
released
from
its
earthly
tabernacle
his
heart
had
been
a
tender
one
more
tender
than
is
often
found
in
man
and
his
youngest
daughter
had
been
his
idol
all
her
life
long
her
protracted
absence
and
her
terrible
return
had
strained
the
chords
of
his
heart
almost
to
breaking
her
sudden
death
had
snapped
them
asunder
two
days
later
they
buried
the
two
who
had
been
so
fondly
united
in
life
side
by
side
in
a
green
and
quiet
graveyard
away
from
the
noise
and
tumult
of
the
great
crowded
city
and
lawrence
ernscliffe
as
he
stood
by
the
grave
calm
to
all
outward
appearance
though
pale
as
sculptured
marble
when
he
turned
away
left
all
the
heart
he
ever
had
to
give
buried
in
the
low
mound
that
held
his
lost
little
queenie
and
night
fell
chilly
moonless
and
starless
the
homeless
winds
sighed
over
the
two
graves
in
the
green
churchyard
and
the
summer
rain
wept
over
them
in
the
darkness
as
though
the
heart
of
heaven
were
breaking
in
tears
the
fallen
earth
chapter
x
but
hark
who
are
those
that
disturb
the
peace
that
broods
like
the
wing
of
an
angel
over
the
city
of
the
dead
under
cover
of
the
darkness
and
the
rain
two
dark
cloaked
forms
steal
along
the
graveled
walk
and
pause
beside
the
spot
where
the
dark
earth
is
heaped
in
swelling
mounds
over
the
hapless
father
and
daughter
the
light
of
a
lantern
flashing
transiently
over
the
form
and
face
of
one
shows
a
tall
straight
form
and
features
as
handsome
as
those
of
a
greek
god
he
speaks
to
your
work
perkins
they
were
so
cursed
long
putting
her
into
the
ground
that
i
feared
my
plot
would
fail
hasten
now
there
is
not
a
minute
to
lose
as
it
is
we
may
be
too
late
the
man
called
perkins
produced
a
spade
from
under
his
cloak
and
set
to
work
cautiously
but
rapidly
throwing
the
earth
off
of
one
of
the
new
graves
are
you
sure
you
are
right
now
perkins
i
believe
i
should
kill
you
if
you
made
a
mistake
said
the
handsome
man
with
the
lantern
grinding
a
terrible
oath
between
his
white
teeth
you
not
have
the
chance
to
wreak
your
temper
on
me
said
perkins
in
a
familiar
tone
as
if
addressing
one
with
whom
he
was
thoroughly
acquainted
i
sure
of
what
i
doing
i
saw
them
put
her
into
this
very
hole
this
evening
hurry
up
then
what
do
you
stop
to
talk
for
make
your
strokes
as
light
as
possible
you
might
be
heard
said
the
irascibly
perkins
redoubled
his
exertions
but
it
seemed
an
age
to
his
impatient
employer
before
the
dull
horrible
thud
of
the
spade
announced
that
the
coffin
was
reached
you
have
to
help
me
git
the
coffin
out
said
perkins
it
will
be
no
easy
job
in
this
darkness
and
the
pouring
rain
it
was
no
easy
job
as
he
had
said
but
their
united
efforts
with
the
usual
appliances
for
such
work
at
length
enabled
them
to
raise
it
out
of
the
grave
and
set
it
on
the
ground
beside
them
even
as
they
did
so
a
dreadful
sound
mingled
with
the
sob
of
the
wind
and
the
putter
of
the
rain
it
was
a
low
and
smothered
moan
from
within
the
coffin
great
god
perkins
wrench
the
lid
off
exclaimed
the
other
excitedly
she
revives
again
and
again
the
low
moan
echoed
within
the
coffin
having
a
horrible
sound
from
within
that
of
death
and
fevering
the
blood
of
the
waiting
man
who
swore
audibly
at
perkins
whose
swiftest
efforts
seemed
like
the
progress
of
a
snail
to
his
impatient
mood
now
sir
said
perkins
at
last
as
panting
and
perspiring
he
threw
off
the
lid
of
the
elegant
casket
now
sir
there
your
game
the
man
flashed
the
lantern
light
forward
it
shone
on
a
beautiful
white
face
fixed
in
unconsciousness
now
the
dews
of
horror
standing
thick
and
wet
on
the
brow
the
lips
bleeding
where
the
pearly
teeth
had
bitten
them
in
anguish
the
small
dimpled
white
hands
clenched
in
the
lace
upon
her
breast
that
was
frayed
and
torn
with
her
frantic
struggles
at
finding
herself
in
that
awful
prison
but
blessed
unconsciousness
had
supervened
and
she
looked
indeed
to
the
eyes
that
beheld
her
looks
like
she
might
be
gone
sure
enough
this
time
sir
said
perkins
uneasily
if
she
i
kill
d
n
you
cried
the
man
i
not
be
balked
of
my
revenge
like
that
i
glut
it
on
somebody
even
while
speaking
he
bent
down
and
laid
his
hand
upon
her
heart
no
she
lives
i
feel
her
heart
beat
faintly
he
said
quick
perkins
the
cloak
it
rains
on
her
the
rain
will
revive
her
said
perkins
as
he
unfolded
a
long
dark
waterproof
cloak
and
handed
it
to
his
companion
the
man
lifted
queenie
slight
form
and
wrapped
the
long
cloak
over
the
bridal
robe
in
which
she
had
been
buried
now
then
he
said
putting
a
thick
roll
of
into
the
hand
cover
up
the
grave
and
remove
every
trace
of
this
night
work
and
one
word
of
to
a
living
soul
and
i
send
your
black
soul
to
the
devil
mum
the
word
sir
answered
the
man
beginning
to
lower
the
empty
coffin
back
into
the
grave
his
employer
turned
without
another
word
and
passed
swiftly
away
through
the
rain
and
the
darkness
to
the
carriage
that
waited
for
him
near
the
gates
bearing
the
unconscious
girl
in
his
arms
he
entered
the
carriage
deposited
the
still
unconscious
queenie
on
a
seat
in
a
recumbent
attitude
and
holding
her
head
in
his
arms
was
whirled
rapidly
away
through
the
murky
night
for
an
hour
or
more
he
rode
thus
and
the
carriage
stopped
at
length
before
a
cottage
embowered
in
trees
on
the
banks
of
a
broad
dark
river
he
lifted
his
burden
stepped
through
the
gate
and
the
carriage
whirled
away
hurrying
up
the
steps
he
paused
on
the
low
ornate
piazza
that
ran
around
the
house
and
rang
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
by
a
woman
of
middle
age
who
held
a
lamp
above
her
head
ah
it
is
you
was
all
she
said
yes
it
is
i
and
i
have
brought
back
your
mistress
bowers
as
i
said
i
would
though
you
have
the
impudence
to
insinuate
that
i
had
made
way
with
her
he
answered
in
a
tone
of
rough
pleasantry
you
are
none
too
good
to
have
done
it
she
answered
with
a
certain
cool
and
familiar
impertinence
confound
your
impudence
lead
the
way
to
her
room
he
said
carelessly
she
is
ill
and
needs
attention
bowers
went
up
the
stairway
and
opened
the
door
into
a
large
airy
room
exquisitely
furnished
and
draped
with
hangings
of
white
lace
over
silk
costly
pictures
and
statuettes
adorned
the
walls
and
all
the
appointments
were
of
elegant
design
and
evidently
selected
regardless
of
expense
bowers
held
back
the
sweeping
lace
canopy
of
the
low
french
bed
and
the
man
laid
his
fair
burden
down
upon
it
after
removing
the
dark
cloak
what
ails
her
asked
the
woman
starting
as
a
low
moan
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
only
girl
i
told
you
she
was
ill
he
said
curtly
she
has
been
in
a
swoon
get
restoratives
bowers
obeyed
him
and
was
soon
bathing
the
pale
face
and
limp
nerveless
hands
with
refreshing
perfume
directly
queenie
started
up
passed
her
hand
across
her
brow
and
looked
about
her
an
expression
of
loathing
swept
across
her
face
are
you
glad
to
find
yourself
in
your
old
quarters
my
dear
asked
the
man
sardonically
from
the
window
to
which
he
had
retreated
she
started
as
if
someone
had
struck
her
a
terrible
blow
and
looked
across
the
room
fear
horror
despair
were
all
blended
in
the
look
she
cast
upon
his
handsome
satanically
smiling
face
chapter
xi
bowers
seeing
that
her
mistress
had
revived
lighted
a
brilliant
jet
of
gas
and
went
out
queenie
did
not
even
notice
her
departure
so
intently
was
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
man
at
the
window
who
stood
there
calm
even
smiling
standing
the
scathing
fire
of
her
beautiful
eyes
like
a
soldier
so
she
said
at
last
and
there
was
surprise
and
regret
both
commingled
in
her
tone
so
you
are
not
no
thanks
to
you
little
tigress
he
answered
with
a
fierce
yellow
light
flaring
into
his
black
eyes
you
did
your
best
to
further
that
end
i
might
have
forseen
how
vain
was
the
endeavor
she
retorted
in
passionate
anger
and
quoted
an
old
saying
they
can
not
be
drowned
who
are
born
to
be
he
laughed
in
mockery
at
the
bitter
insinuation
but
years
after
when
the
light
of
heaven
shone
on
him
through
the
grated
bars
of
a
prison
cell
and
he
heard
outside
the
horrible
sound
of
the
hammers
driving
the
nails
into
his
scaffold
he
remembered
the
words
with
wonder
and
thought
she
must
have
been
gifted
with
as
the
scotch
called
the
gift
of
prophecy
now
i
know
it
was
you
that
sent
me
the
flowers
she
said
why
did
you
do
it
they
were
poisoned
no
only
drugged
it
was
a
subtle
drug
i
bought
in
the
east
long
ago
a
drug
warranted
to
produce
a
long
and
sudden
sleep
perfectly
resembling
death
again
i
ask
you
why
did
you
do
it
she
said
and
her
voice
was
full
of
wonder
i
wanted
to
get
you
into
my
power
once
more
that
was
the
safest
plan
to
effect
it
i
let
them
bury
you
and
then
i
resurrected
you
what
did
you
want
of
me
you
wearied
of
me
before
why
not
have
let
me
go
in
peace
she
tried
to
speak
calmly
but
her
voice
trembled
with
some
inward
resentment
and
there
was
a
passion
of
hatred
in
her
dusky
eyes
that
might
have
killed
him
where
he
stood
a
rage
as
deadly
as
hers
leaped
up
in
his
eyes
in
answer
because
i
you
he
said
wickedly
we
always
hate
those
whom
we
have
wronged
she
replied
and
her
whole
form
trembled
with
her
passionate
indignation
i
hate
you
because
of
that
cowardly
blow
in
the
dark
he
said
angrily
but
for
that
i
might
have
let
you
go
free
though
i
pitied
captain
ernscliffe
for
being
deceived
by
you
villain
she
exclaimed
i
have
not
deceived
him
you
have
not
he
sneered
did
you
not
withhold
from
him
the
story
of
that
year
which
he
supposed
you
to
have
spent
in
europe
did
you
not
allow
him
to
think
you
an
innocent
woman
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
stood
facing
him
her
eyes
dilating
her
cheeks
flushing
her
small
hands
clenched
tightly
in
her
breathless
anger
an
artist
pencil
might
have
handed
his
name
down
to
immortal
fame
could
he
have
put
on
canvas
that
striking
scene
the
beautiful
room
and
the
man
in
his
splendid
insolent
satanic
beauty
standing
before
that
lovely
incarnation
of
pride
and
passion
with
her
glorious
veil
of
golden
hair
falling
loosely
about
her
superb
form
and
the
shining
folds
of
her
costly
bridal
robe
sweeping
far
behind
her
on
the
rich
velvet
carpet
i
an
innocent
woman
she
said
proudly
and
the
light
shone
on
her
lifted
face
and
the
earnest
fire
in
her
eyes
i
an
innocent
woman
i
have
done
no
wrong
though
i
am
a
betrayed
unhappy
and
insulted
victim
i
have
been
sinned
against
but
i
have
not
sinned
he
laughed
cruelly
mockingly
insultingly
why
do
you
laugh
she
said
know
that
it
is
true
you
deceived
me
and
betrayed
me
but
was
i
to
blame
i
carried
the
marriage
certificate
in
my
breast
as
a
precious
thing
i
thought
it
was
true
as
heaven
i
thought
i
was
pure
as
the
snow
and
i
how
could
sin
touch
me
again
he
laughed
mockingly
your
mind
is
strangely
warped
he
said
but
if
you
were
innocent
in
the
one
thing
how
about
the
blow
in
the
dark
was
there
no
sin
in
that
i
deny
that
there
was
sin
she
said
with
passionate
defiance
in
her
look
and
tone
it
was
simple
justice
blow
for
a
blow
you
drove
me
mad
with
the
horror
and
cruelty
of
all
i
learned
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
given
back
from
the
grave
to
rid
the
world
of
a
monster
you
failed
he
said
derisively
yes
to
my
sorrow
she
answered
but
ah
leon
vinton
surely
a
day
of
reckoning
will
come
to
you
the
justice
of
god
will
not
always
sleep
i
was
not
permitted
to
take
your
punishment
out
of
his
hands
who
has
said
is
mine
i
will
repay
it
will
come
it
will
come
you
prate
of
god
vengeance
he
said
sneeringly
but
it
suits
you
to
forget
that
the
preachers
call
him
also
a
god
of
mercy
and
love
and
forgiveness
forgiveness
she
echoed
wildly
neither
god
nor
man
could
forgive
you
leon
vinton
you
have
committed
an
unpardonable
sin
you
have
broken
my
heart
you
have
tried
to
kill
my
soul
you
murdered
me
can
i
ever
forgive
she
swept
back
the
golden
waves
of
hair
that
shaded
her
white
brow
and
showed
him
the
livid
scar
of
a
deep
wound
beneath
them
it
is
your
hellish
work
she
said
you
ground
your
cruel
into
the
brow
your
false
lips
had
kissed
a
thousand
times
you
strangled
my
life
out
with
the
hands
that
had
caressed
me
uncounted
times
oh
my
god
can
i
ever
forgive
or
forget
my
wrongs
i
will
kill
you
the
next
time
more
surely
curse
you
he
hissed
in
ungovernable
rage
and
striding
forward
he
caught
her
white
arm
rudely
almost
crushing
it
in
his
iron
grasp
cease
girl
not
another
word
she
wrenched
herself
out
of
his
grasp
and
answered
defiantly
let
me
go
then
if
you
can
not
bear
my
reproaches
let
me
return
to
my
husband
a
sneer
curled
his
thin
lips
as
she
spoke
with
an
unconscious
accent
of
tenderness
on
the
words
my
husband
your
husband
as
you
call
him
shall
never
know
that
you
are
not
mouldering
yonder
in
rose
hill
cemetery
you
shall
never
look
upon
his
face
again

she
said
drawing
her
graceful
form
erect
with
a
defiant
dignity
ernscliffe
then
if
it
pleases
you
better
he
answered
mockingly
though
why
you
care
for
the
name
i
do
not
know
you
do
not
love
the
man
i
love
him
she
answered
firmly
her
fair
head
slightly
drooped
and
a
burning
blush
crimsoning
her
cheeks
since
when
he
queried
sneeringly
you
did
not
love
him
when
he
asked
you
to
marry
him
i
heard
you
tell
him
so
you
heard
me
she
exclaimed
in
surprise
yes
i
was
a
witness
to
that
moonlight
wooing
i
have
seldom
lost
sight
of
you
since
you
returned
to
your
father
house
and
resumed
the
of
innocent
maidenhood
a
spy
she
said
scornfully
yes
if
you
put
it
so
he
answered
coolly
we
need
not
be
particular
about
terms
she
looked
at
him
as
if
he
were
something
wonderful
the
effrontery
of
his
wickedness
almost
paralyzed
her
she
clasped
her
hands
and
lifted
her
blue
eyes
oh
just
heaven
she
said
why
does
thy
vengeance
tarry
in
smiting
this
monster
permit
me
to
commend
your
dramatic
ability
he
said
with
a
bow
your
tones
and
gestures
would
make
your
fortune
on
the
tragic
stage
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
dropped
her
face
into
her
hands
she
was
very
weary
and
physically
exhausted
having
eaten
nothing
since
the
day
of
her
supposed
death
but
she
felt
no
hunger
now
though
she
was
faint
and
thirsty
your
tirade
appears
to
be
over
he
remarked
with
his
evil
sneer
she
looked
up
tell
me
one
thing
she
said
trying
to
speak
calmly
what
do
you
want
of
me
why
did
you
care
to
get
me
back
when
we
both
hate
each
other
the
glare
of
that
hatred
of
which
she
spoke
flamed
luridly
up
in
his
dark
eyes
that
is
the
very
reason
that
i
brought
you
back
he
answered
because
i
hated
you
and
because
i
intended
to
make
your
life
one
long
insufferable
weariness
to
you
until
you
die
again
she
looked
at
him
with
wonder
her
gentler
nature
could
not
fathom
the
cruel
vindictiveness
of
his
oh
leon
she
gasped
you
would
not
be
so
cruel
think
of
all
that
i
have
suffered
at
your
hands
already
let
me
go
i
beg
you
i
am
so
young
i
may
make
something
of
my
life
yet
if
i
can
only
go
back
to
the
good
true
man
i
have
already
learned
to
love
and
honor
the
words
seemed
to
madden
him
never
he
shouted
hoarsely
with
a
terrible
oath
never
i
hate
lawrence
ernscliffe
i
have
an
old
grudge
against
him
i
will
have
my
revenge
on
you
both
you
shall
stay
here
locked
in
these
four
walls
a
hated
prisoner
as
long
as
you
live
bowers
shall
be
your
jailer
and
here
you
shall
dwell
eating
your
heart
out
in
abject
wretchedness
and
misery
unutterable

queenie
heard
the
key
grate
in
the
lock
and
sprang
up
uttering
wild
shrieks
of
passion
and
despair
almost
beside
herself
with
the
horror
of
her
new
situation
but
no
response
came
to
her
frenzied
screams
and
cries
perhaps
those
gilded
walls
had
echoed
such
wails
of
agony
before
and
the
hearts
of
those
who
heard
them
had
grown
callous
with
long
familiarity
she
ran
up
and
down
the
room
like
one
mad
alternately
skrieking
and
beating
upon
the
locked
door
until
she
fell
upon
the
floor
conquered
by
sheer
exhaustion
she
lay
there
awhile
then
sprang
up
restlessly
again
i
will
endure
it
no
longer
she
said
passionately
i
will
throw
myself
down
from
the
window
and
kill
myself
full
of
that
wild
suicidal
resolve
she
ran
to
the
window
and
pushed
up
the
sash
the
night
was
far
spent
and
that
awful
darkness
that
comes
just
before
dawn
obscured
everything
its
blackness
intensified
by
the
drizzling
rain
that
still
poured
steadily
down
queenie
fell
upon
her
knees
with
the
rain
beating
in
upon
her
white
face
and
long
flowing
hair
and
clasped
her
little
hands
together
as
her
father
had
taught
her
to
do
when
she
was
but
a
toddling
oh
god
she
prayed
lifting
her
lovely
despairing
face
to
the
dark
sky
as
if
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
father
to
whom
she
appealed
oh
god
pity
and
forgive
me
for
sending
my
soul
uncalled
for
before
its
divine
maker
and
heavenly
father
whatever
of
wrong
i
have
committed
do
thou
pity
and
pardon
it
that
sin
with
which
i
stand
charged
thou
knowest
i
would
have
died
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
willfully
commit
it
and
she
paused
overcome
by
agonized
recollections
and
rising
peered
out
into
the
darkness
below
in
the
morning
when
he
comes
out
into
the
garden
she
said
he
will
find
my
poor
crushed
bleeding
body
lying
beneath
this
window
surely
then
when
his
murderous
hate
has
driven
me
to
his
revenge
will
be
complete
she
placed
her
hand
on
the
sill
of
the
window
and
leaned
forward
for
the
fatal
spring
that
was
to
end
her
earthly
sorrows
how
slight
a
thing
can
distract
our
attention
even
in
the
most
absorbing
moments
of
our
lives
queenie
hands
fell
upon
a
cold
wet
mass
of
leaves
and
a
gust
of
intoxicating
perfume
blew
into
her
face
she
immediately
drew
back
she
had
suddenly
remembered
that
some
thickly
twisted
vines
of
ivy
and
honeysuckle
were
trained
up
to
her
window
in
the
second
story
a
thought
as
sudden
as
an
inspiration
darted
into
her
mind
instead
of
dashing
her
brains
out
on
the
hard
ground
below
why
not
escape
down
this
ladder
of
vines
to
love
and
happiness
again
i
will
do
it
she
said
to
herself
i
will
go
back
to
my
husband
i
will
tell
him
i
was
stolen
from
my
grave
and
that
i
revived
in
the
fresh
air
and
life
came
back
to
me
in
its
full
tide
oh
how
glad
he
will
be
to
see
me
my
poor
lawrence
he
loved
me
so
dearly
in
the
swift
revulsion
of
feeling
from
despair
and
desperation
to
love
and
hope
again
she
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
hysterical
tears
i
must
not
stay
here
to
weep
she
said
at
length
brushing
the
crystal
drops
away
from
her
cheeks
i
must
be
far
on
my
way
to
my
husband
before
he
discovers
my
escape
she
took
up
the
thick
hooded
waterproof
cloak
that
lay
on
a
chair
and
wrapped
it
around
her
this
will
never
do
she
said
seeing
the
long
train
of
her
splendid
dress
sweeping
from
beneath
the
hem
of
the
cloak
i
must
not
be
seen
going
into
the
city
in
this
plight
she
took
off
the
cloak
and
tucked
up
the
long
train
and
pinned
it
securely
around
her
resumed
the
waterproof
and
climbed
up
into
the
window
farewell
leon
vinton
she
said
pray
god
i
may
never
look
on
your
evil
face
again
she
took
a
firm
hold
of
the
thick
body
of
the
vine
with
both
hands
and
with
a
slight
shudder
swung
herself
forward
into
the
darkness
the
vine
swayed
and
creaked
with
her
weight
and
for
one
dreadful
moment
she
thought
she
should
be
precipitated
to
the
ground
to
the
death
which
a
moment
before
she
had
courted
but
which
now
in
the
new
dawn
of
hope
she
shunned
the
shower
of
shaken
down
from
the
leaves
into
her
face
almost
took
her
breath
away
the
wild
wind
tossed
her
from
side
to
side
like
a
feather
as
she
clung
to
her
frail
support
i
shall
surely
be
killed
she
said
to
herself
in
terror
but
no
the
delicate
reed
to
which
she
had
trusted
her
existence
did
not
fail
her
she
waited
breathlessly
a
moment
then
feeling
that
it
still
held
secure
she
cautiously
slipped
one
hand
and
then
the
other
down
to
a
lower
hold
on
the
body
of
the
vine
in
that
way
with
many
frightened
with
sore
and
bleeding
hands
and
at
infinite
pains
she
at
length
accomplished
the
descent
and
stood
upon
the
ground
enfolded
like
a
mantle
by
the
thick
darkness
and
pouring
rain
at
the
gate
she
paused
again
and
looked
up
at
one
window
in
a
wing
of
the
house
where
a
glimmered
faintly
farewell
leon
vinton
she
said
again
may
the
vengeance
of
god
be
swift
to
overtake
and
punish
you
for
your
awful
sins
she
opened
the
gate
softly
and
stepped
out
into
the
wet
and
slushy
road
wetting
her
thin
white
satin
slippers
and
silk
stockings
through
and
through
at
the
first
step
she
did
not
care
for
it
she
scarcely
felt
it
her
heart
was
beating
so
quick
and
fast
with
joy
i
am
free
was
the
exultant
cry
of
her
heart
i
am
free
i
am
going
back
to
my
husband
i
shall
tell
him
how
fondly
i
have
learned
to
love
him
since
i
promised
to
be
his
wife
i
will
cling
so
closely
to
his
side
that
leon
vindictive
rage
can
never
touch
me
she
pushed
on
steadily
through
the
mud
and
water
her
long
garments
speedily
becoming
soaked
with
the
watery
elements
and
greatly
impeding
her
ease
and
rapidity
of
motion
while
her
heart
began
to
beat
wildly
with
terror
at
the
darkness
the
desolation
and
loneliness
of
the
country
road
i
am
very
tired
she
moaned
after
traveling
what
seemed
to
her
a
long
distance
it
is
five
miles
to
the
city
i
must
have
come
two
miles
at
least
i
wonder
if
i
can
hold
out
to
get
there
my
feet
are
so
heavy
with
the
mud
and
the
water
that
i
can
scarcely
lift
them
i
must
sit
down
here
and
rest
myself
one
minute
only
little
she
dropped
down
like
a
log
on
the
grass
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
the
first
pale
beams
of
the
watery
dawn
just
breaking
in
the
east
showed
her
face
just
fading
into
unconsciousness
chapter
xiii
when
queenie
threw
herself
down
upon
the
wet
grass
in
a
weariness
so
utter
that
she
could
no
longer
hold
her
aching
limbs
upright
she
had
thought
that
a
minute
of
rest
would
put
new
strength
into
her
exhausted
frame
and
enable
her
to
pursue
her
journey
but
exhausted
nature
could
bear
no
more
her
unbroken
fast
of
nearly
three
days
and
her
wet
and
draggled
condition
combined
to
weaken
and
depress
her
her
limbs
trembled
under
her
and
when
she
fell
down
for
one
minute
rest
a
deep
unconsciousness
stole
upon
her
wrapping
her
senses
in
lethargy
her
last
conscious
thought
was
one
of
agonized
terror
lest
ere
she
revived
her
enemy
should
discover
her
escape
and
set
out
to
trace
her
while
she
lay
there
mute
and
still
the
dawn
began
to
grow
brighter
in
the
east
the
rain
slackened
and
a
few
pale
beams
of
sunshine
striking
upon
the
scene
showed
that
she
had
fallen
almost
at
the
gate
of
a
little
from
whose
chimneys
the
blue
smoke
curled
cheerfully
up
showing
that
the
inhabitants
were
already
up
and
about
their
daily
labors
presently
a
man
in
the
rough
coarse
garb
of
a
farmer
came
out
of
the
house
and
strode
down
to
the
gate
whistling
a
merry
tune
and
snapping
and
cracking
the
great
leathern
whip
he
carried
in
his
hand
as
he
stepped
outside
the
gate
his
cheerful
whistle
suddenly
ended
in
an
exclamation
of
terror
his
glance
had
fallen
on
the
still
form
lying
just
outside
the
gate
with
its
lovely
white
face
and
closed
eyes
upturned
to
the
light
he
stood
still
a
moment
looking
down
at
her
in
awe
and
consternation
what
a
pretty
young
un
he
said
aloud
and
she
dead
i
mistrust
stone
dead
the
next
moment
he
leaned
over
the
gate
and
called
loudly
wife
wife
come
out
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
appeared
she
was
flushed
as
if
she
had
been
over
the
fire
and
held
some
small
cooking
utensil
in
her
hand
well
jerry
she
said
what
do
you
want
now
come
out
and
see
he
answered
well
but
i
ca
leave
the
cakes
said
she
intent
on
her
housewifely
cares
they
will
burn
tell
jennie
to
mind
the
gridiron
he
said
and
do
you
come
out
to
me
she
went
in
and
reappeared
after
a
minute
coming
down
the
path
with
her
homely
check
apron
thrown

this
morning
a
pity
i

to
mind
the
as
well
as
the
jerry
whom
this
home
thrust
betrayed
to
be
a
shiftless
fellow
dependent
on
his
more
orderly
ways
looked
up
to
laugh
then
checked
himself
awed
by
the
presence
of
that
still
form
at
his
feet
there
naught
misplaced
this
time
my
dear
he
said
you
be
forever
twitting
a
poor
careless
fellow
with
his
faults
what
amiss
then
she
said
as
she
came
up
to
the
gate
look
he
answered
pointing
down
a
poor
tramp
dead
in
the
road
the
good
woman
looked
started
and
her
healthy
red
cheeks
turned
white
oh
my
heavenly
father
she
ejaculated
who
jerry
how
should

know

asked
her
husband

but
just
stepped
outside
the
gate
and
found
her
and

looks
like
it
he
said
but
stoop
down
and
feel
of
her
heart
jane

if
it
beats
the
woman
came
out
of
the
gate
and
bending
down
put
her
hand
inside
of
queenie
cloak
and
felt
her
heart
yes
no

does
beat
just
the
leastest
bit
she
said
poor
creature

her
up
and
carry
her
into
the
kitchen
jerry

we
may
revive
her
that
like
your
good
heart
jane
said
the
farmer
as
he
lifted
up
the
limp
form
and
conveyed
it
into
the
kitchen
a
rosy
exceedingly
pretty
girl
who
was
busily
frying
over
the
fire
came
forward
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
as
he
laid
his
burden
down
upon
the
lounge
that
stood
in
one
corner
never
mind
the
cakes
jennie
said
her
mother
come
and
lend
a
hand
to
save
a
poor
creetur
as
your
father
found
perishin
in
the
road
what

i
do
mother
asked
the
girl
take
them
muddy
things
off
her
feet
and
rub
the
poor
creetur
limbs
dry
said
the
good
woman
busying
herself
in
removing
the
wet
cloak
i
declare
to
gracious
she
said
after
a
moment
how
blind
men
are
jerry
called
her
a
tramp
look
at
them
rings
on
her
fingers
look
at
that
dress
fine
enough
for
the
finest
bride
is
that
the
way
tramps

mr
thorn
she
of
the
finest
quality
mother
said
the
girl
called
jennie
her
slippers
are
white
satin
her
stockings
pure
silk
and
worked
all
over
with
flowers
never
mind
the
shoes
and
the
stockings
jennie
said
her
father
but
rub
the
little
un
feet
see
how
cold
and
blue
they
are
thus
adjured
jennie
brought
a
warm
flannel
cloth
and
began
to
rub
the
icy
little
feet
of
the
wayfarer
while
her
mother
brought
strong
camphor
and
bathed
the
pale
face
now
and
then
applying
a
bottle
of
ammonia
to
her
nostrils
under
this
vigorous
treatment
and
the
revivifying
heat
of
the
room
the
patient
heart
began
to
beat
quicker
and
a
faint
pulse
to
flutter
in
her
wrist
poor
soul
exclaimed
thorn
i
wonder
how
she
came
to
be
out
in
such
a
storm
all
in
her
party
dress
too
she
be
as
pretty
as
a
pink
with
her
eyes
open
and
a
bit
more
color
in
her
cheeks
the
farmer
now
approached
with
a
cup
of
warm
coffee
and
a
teaspoon
belike
she
needs
summat
to
warm
her
up
he
said
take
the
spoon
jane
and
force
a
wee
bit
of
coffee
between
her
lips
thorn
did
as
requested
but
with
no
visible
result
for
the
better
the
patient
still
lay
with
closed
eyes
and
lips
showing
no
sign
of
life
save
in
the
tremulous
beat
of
her
heart
and
the
faint
faint
pulse
of
her
wrist
thorn
still
worked
patiently
over
her
but
at
the
end
of
an
hour
looked
disheartened
i
mistrust
that
this
is
a
case
for
the
doctor
she
said
we
have
done
what
we
could
but
all
to
no
use
i
could
bring
a
doctor
but
who
to
pay
him
said
the
farmer
we
have
no
money
jane
and
jennie
out
of
work
the
lady
could
pay
him
herself
suggested
jennie
there
them
rings
on
her
fingers
worth
a
mint
of
money
yea
that
so
said
the
mother
go
and
get
the
doctor
jennie
the
lady
will
die
i
afraid
if
she
lays
in
this
state
much
longer
i
go
and
bring
pillsbury
then
said
the
farmer
going
out
followed
by
repeated
injunctions
from
his
wife
to
hurry
there
not
a
minute
to
lose
she
said
even
now
it
may
be
too
late
to
raise
the
poor
creetur
to
life
again
so
low
as
she
has
sunk
chapter
xiv
farmer
thorn
stepped
out
of
the
gate
and
was
about
to
proceed
on
his
way
when
his
attention
was
arrested
by
the
rather
unusual
sight
of
a
gentleman
tearing
madly
along
the
road
on
a
fine
black
horse
the
farmer
was
so
impressed
with
the
parting
injunction
of
his
wife
as
to
the
necessity
of
a
physician
immediate
presence
that
a
wild
fancy
that
this
hurrying
horseman
might
belong
to
the
medical
fraternity
darted
directly
into
his
mind
he
accordingly
lifted
his
hand
as
a
signal
for
the
impetuous
rider
to
pause
the
gentleman
checked
his
impatient
steed
and
inquired
with
a
smothered
oath
what
the
deuce
is
your
business
with
me
i
in
a
devil
of
a
hurry
i
mistrusted
you
might
be
a
doctor
said
the
farmer
inquiringly
the
devil
who
sick
was
the
exceedingly
civil
rejoinder
a
strange
lady
that
we
found
in
the
road
this
morning
she
like
to
die
said
thorn
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
rider
was
off
his
horse
with
the
bridle
thrown
over
his
arm
yes
i
a
doctor
he
said
briskly
here
tie
up
my
horse
and
let
me
see
the
patient
at
once
thorn
was
so
impressed
by
the
confident
air
of
the
man
that
he
readily
obeyed
the
somewhat
arrogant
command
and
thorn
and
jennie
were
somewhat
surprised
at
his
quick
return
accompanied
by
an
utter
stranger
i
met
a
doctor
right
at
the
gate
wife
he
explained
so
i
did
not
go
for
dr
pillsbury
here
your
patient
sir
said
thorn
turning
back
the
gay
patchwork
counterpane
in
which
she
had
carefully
enveloped
the
unconscious
queenie
what
was
her
surprise
to
see
him
fall
upon
his
knees
and
clasp
his
hands
while
his
dark
handsome
features
became
luminous
with
mingled
joy
and
sorrow
oh
my
dear
sister
my
sweet
unhappy
girl
he
exclaimed
is
it
thus
i
find
you
oh
madam
is
she
indeed
dead
he
inquired
turning
sadly
to
thorn
her
heart
beats
just
a
little
sir
said
thorn
looking
at
him
in
surprise
do
you
know
the
lady
sir
asked
jennie
thorn
a
little
timidly
the
man
turned
around
and
looked
at
the
farmer
exceedingly
pretty
daughter
with
a
furtive
look
of
admiration
instead
of
answering
her
he
spoke
to
the
farmer
your
daughter
i
suppose
sir
yes
sir
my
daughter
jennie
said
the
farmer
with
a
glance
of
pride
at
his
pretty
daughter
she
been
out
at
service
this
three
years
sir
but
at
present
she
out
of
a
place
ah
he
said
politely
then
turning
back
to
the
motionless
form
before
him
he
said
yes
miss
jennie
i
know
this
lady
she
is
my
own
sister
unfortunately
she
is
insane
driven
mad
by
an
unhappy
love
affair
she
persists
in
dressing
herself
in
white
and
calling
herself
a
bride
this
morning
just
before
daybreak
she
escaped
from
us
and
i
have
been
seeking
her
everywhere
it
was
a
fortunate
chance
that
led
me
here
do
you
think
that
she
will
revive
sir
inquired
thorn
who
was
watching
the
patient
anxiously
he
turned
and
laid
his
hand
over
the
girl
heart
knitting
his
brows
with
an
air
of
medical
wisdom
oh
yes
he
said
confidently
there
is
life
here
yet
she
is
weak
and
exhausted
having
eaten
but
little
for
several
days
have
you
tried
forcing
a
little
wine
between
her
lips
no
we
had
none
apologized
the
farmer
we
are
but
poor
folks
pretty
jennie
thorn
blushed
and
looked
away
at
her
father
frank
admission
she
felt
ashamed
of
their
poverty
before
the
haughty
glance
of
the
handsome
stranger
the
man
took
a
little
flask
with
a
golden
stopper
from
his
pocket
it
was
full
of
wine
and
he
lifted
queenie
head
on
his
arm
poured
a
few
drops
between
her
pale
lips
and
suffered
them
to
trickle
down
her
throat
he
repeated
the
operation
several
times
then
laid
her
head
gently
back
on
the
pillow
you
will
soon
see
her
rally
now
he
said
looking
at
jennie
with
a
smile
and
now
i
must
be
making
arrangements
to
take
my
poor
little
sister
home
again
a
startled
cry
came
from
the
lips
of
the
invalid
the
man
last
words
had
penetrated
her
reviving
senses
she
raised
herself
on
her
arm
and
looked
about
her
at
the
unfamiliar
room
and
the
strange
faces
around
her
leon
vinton
here
she
exclaimed
in
a
piteous
tone
oh
heaven
where
am
i
we
are
all
friends
miss
said
thorn
soothingly
you
fell
exhausted
by
the
roadside
and
we
took
you
in
and
cared
for
you
until
your
brother
came
along
and
found
you
here
queenie
eyes
flashed
scornfully
into
leon
vinton
face
does
say
that
he
is
my
brother
she
demanded
pointing
her
finger
at
him
and
looking
at
thorn
yes
miss
answered
the
woman
he
lies
exclaimed
queenie
passionately
gaining
strength
with
her
anger
i
am
nothing
to
him
nothing
he
is
trying
to
deceive
you
that
he
may
get
me
into
his
power
leon
vinton
sighed
mournfully
and
shook
his
head
as
he
looked
around
at
the
girl
auditors
ah
my
friends
i
told
you
she
was
mad
he
said
sadly
you
see
she
denies
her
own
brother
you
are
my
brother
villain
exclaimed
queenie
angrily
and
looking
round
at
the
others
she
said
my
good
friends
do
not
believe
this
man
i
am
no
relative
of
his
and
he
is
trying
to
deceive
you
and
get
me
into
his
power
to
torture
my
life
out
oh
sir
i
appeal
to
you
and
to
you
madam
also
to
protect
me
from
this
villain
drive
him
forth
this
moment
from
this
honest
house
whose
pure
air
he
pollutes
with
his
foul
presence
the
farmer
and
his
wife
began
to
cast
dark
looks
at
leon
vinton
so
impressed
were
they
with
the
earnestness
of
the
girl
words
and
looks
they
began
to
think
it
was
the
truth
she
spoke
instead
of
the
ravings
of
madness
the
arch
villain
soon
saw
that
they
were
inclined
to
doubt
his
word
and
threw
fresh
earnestness
and
eloquence
into
his
dramatic
manner
oh
my
darling
unfortunate
little
sister
he
cried
dropping
on
one
knee
beside
her
and
trying
to
take
her
hands
in
his
how
it
grieves
me
that
your
distraught
mind
should
take
me
for
the
accursed
villain
who
has
destroyed
your
happiness
forever
me
your
devoted
brother
whose
whole
life
is
devoted
to
your
service
villain
wretch
exclaimed
queenie
out
of
my
sight
before
i
try
to
kill
you
oh
will
no
one
drive
the
monster
away
she
wildly
cried
she
grows
violent
said
vinton
looking
sadly
around
him
i
must
remove
her
from
here
before
her
frenzy
leads
her
to
harm
some
of
you
have
you
any
kind
of
a
comfortable
trap
that
i
could
take
her
home
in
he
inquired
looking
at
the
farmer
i
will
not
go
with
you
exclaimed
the
unhappy
girl
i
am
going
home
to
my
husband
you
shall
not
prevent
me
oh
sir
she
cried
turning
her
streaming
eyes
on
thorn
face
you
will
not
suffer
this
man
to
take
me
away
from
here
i
assure
you
i
am
no
kin
of
his
and
that
he
is
seeking
my
destruction
grant
me
the
shelter
of
your
roof
and
your
manly
protection
against
this
villain
arts
till
i
can
send
word
to
my
father
and
my
husband
to
come
for
me
thorn
looked
at
the
agonized
face
of
the
beautiful
girl
and
he
could
not
believe
that
she
was
insane
there
seemed
too
much
method
in
her
madness
he
cast
a
suspicious
look
on
vinton
and
answered
firmly
be
calm
lady
he
shall
not
take
you
away
without
proof
of
what
he
says
about
you
i
will
protect
you
oh
father
how
can
you
presume
to
doubt
the
gentleman
word
exclaimed
jennie
thorn
impulsively
for
the
man
handsome
face
and
consummate
acting
had
quite
won
her
young
impressionable
heart
over
to
his
side
leon
vinton
cast
a
grateful
look
upon
her
throwing
so
much
impressiveness
into
his
look
that
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
blushed
deeply
in
that
moment
the
villain
saw
the
impression
he
had
made
upon
her
innocent
heart
and
the
simple
trusting
girl
was
from
that
instant
marked
as
his
victim
sir
he
said
turning
to
the
farmer
and
speaking
in
an
imperious
tone
do
not
you
know
that
i
can
take
legal
means
to
punish
you
for
thus
depriving
me
of
the
custody
of
my
insane
sister
i
do
not
believe
she
is
insane
said
the
farmer
doggedly
neither
do
i
believe
that
she
is
your
sister
and
you
ca
take
her
away
from
here
without
proving
your
right
well
said
husband
exclaimed
thorn
approvingly
for
her
motherly
heart
was
full
of
sympathy
for
the
distressed
girl
who
had
so
touchingly
implored
her
protection
queenie
cast
a
look
of
heartfelt
gratitude
upon
these
homely
friends
who
had
espoused
her
cause
in
so
outspoken
a
way
but
simple
jennie
thorn
exclaimed
quickly
oh
mother
oh
father
i
sure
the
gent
speaks
the
truth
the
lady
be
crazy
for
how
else
could
she
be
wandering
in
the
night
and
the
storm
in
her
white
dress
and
thin
satin
slippers
hold
your
peace
girl
this
is
a
matter
for
wiser
heads
than
yours
answered
her
father
rather
shortly
and
jennie
subsided
into
silence
not
however
without
receiving
the
reward
in
another
beaming
look
of
gratitude
from
the
dark
eyes
of
the
man
whom
she
was
defending
vinton
tried
another
tack
finding
the
farmer
sense
of
justice
impregnable
to
threats
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
withdrew
it
filled
with
gold
pieces
he
held
them
toward
the
man
with
a
significant
look
put
your
gold
back
sir
said
the
farmer
sturdily
we
are
poor
folks
enough
but
gold
ca
buy
our
honor
and
though
he
was
but
a
poor
tiller
of
the
soil
his
mien
was
princely
as
he
thus
defended
his
honor
leon
vinton
brow
grew
black
as
night
he
muttered
some
inaudible
curses
between
his
teeth
only
his
sense
of
policy
restrained
him
from
knocking
thorn
down
what
am
i
to
do
he
said
with
an
air
of
great
perplexity
here
is
my
poor
sister
lying
here
needing
the
care
of
her
friends
and
the
comforts
and
luxuries
of
her
home
yet
you
will
not
permit
me
to
exercise
my
right
to
remove
her
prove
your
right
sir
said
the
farmer
firmly
that
all
i
want
you
to
do
and
if
i
prove
my
right
to
remove
her
you
will
suffer
me
to
do
so
asked
leon
after
a
moment
earnest
thought
why
of
course
sir
i
have
no
right
to
detain
her
after
that
he
can
not
prove
his
right
exclaimed
queenie
who
had
lain
silent
for
some
minutes
have
you
an
errand
boy
asked
vinton
disregarding
the
interruption
thorn
went
to
the
door
and
called
jotham
and
the
shambled
in
do
you
know
a
cottage
on
the
banks
of
the
river
two
miles
from
here
jotham
sur
said
the
boy
broadly
leon
vinton
wrote
these
words
on
a
slip
of
paper
the
carriage
and
come
here
he
directed
the
note
to
bowers
and
gave
it
to
the
boy
with
instructions
to
deliver
it
at
the
cottage
by
the
river
chapter
xv
the
time
passed
slowly
enough
to
the
impatient
vinton
while
the
was
gone
on
his
mission
to
bowers
he
paced
up
and
down
impatiently
now
and
then
casting
surly
looks
of
hatred
and
revenge
upon
the
honest
farmer
who
had
dared
to
defy
him
and
protect
his
trembling
victim
thorn
seeing
that
queenie
was
better
and
did
not
need
her
attention
busied
herself
in
setting
the
neglected
breakfast
upon
the
table
she
put
on
the
smoking
coffee
the
hot
the
fried
bacon
and
eggs
the
fresh
butter
and
milk
and
invited
her
visitors
to
partake
of
the
homely
fare
leon
vinton
declined
the
invitation
by
a
surly
nod
but
queenie
who
had
been
watching
her
movements
eagerly
readily
signified
her
consent
i
am
very
hungry
she
declared
for
owing
to
the
wickedness
of
yonder
man
i
have
not
tasted
food
for
several
days
oh
my
poor
demented
little
sister
exclaimed
the
hypocritical
vinton
would
to
god
your
reason
might
be
restored
queenie
only
cast
a
look
of
scorn
upon
him
as
she
took
her
place
at
the
her
heart
was
infused
with
fresh
courage
owing
to
the
noble
conduct
of
the
farmer
and
his
wife
in
repelling
the
persecutions
of
leon
vinton
she
determined
to
get
the
farmer
to
go
into
town
for
her
father
and
she
resolved
that
these
kind
people
should
be
most
liberally
rewarded
for
the
resolute
course
by
which
they
had
secured
her
happiness
so
inspired
was
she
by
this
brilliant
hope
and
so
strengthened
by
the
warm
coffee
that
a
faint
flush
came
into
her
cheek
and
her
blue
eyes
sparkled
with
excitement
and
animation
your
breakfast
has
set
you
up
quite
a
bit
exclaimed
thorn
admiringly
you
do
hardly
look
like
the
same
woman
we
took
up
for
dead
in
the
road
your
kindness
has
put
new
life
in
me
madam
answered
queenie
gratefully
it
is
the
hope
of
escape
from
this
man
that
fills
me
with
joy
and
lights
up
my
face
with
gladness
poor
dear
exclaimed
the
woman
turning
a
look
of
scorn
on
vinton
as
he
still
moodily
paced
the
floor
ah
madam
exclaimed
he
catching
that
look
in
a
little
while
when
my
sister
arrives
and
corroborates
my
story
you
will
see
how
much
you
have
wronged
me
in
giving
credence
to
the
senseless
ravings
of
this
poor
lunatic
even
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
stir
and
a
bustle
at
the
door
the
farmer
hastened
to
open
it
and
bowers
elegantly
dressed
and
visibly
excited
rushed
in
leon
vinton
sprang
to
meet
her
oh
my
dear
sister
he
exclaimed
i
have
found
our
poor
little
one
bowers
took
the
cue
at
once
oh
brother
she
cried
theatrically
you
fill
me
with
joy
what
tortures
what
agonies
i
have
endured
in
the
fear
that
she
was
dead
she
rolled
her
eyes
around
the
room
and
seeing
queenie
sitting
near
the
fire
ran
up
and
vigorously
embraced
her
oh
my
poor
unhappy
darling
she
cried
how
could
you
grieve
your
poor
old
sister
so
queenie
pushed
her
off
frantically
like
the
mad
creature
they
accused
her
of
being
you
are
not
my
sister
she
cried
angrily
go
away
bowers
you
can
not
impose
on
these
good
people
with
your
shameless
lies
they
would
not
believe
leon
vinton
and
they
will
not
believe
you
they
are
friends
to
me
and
they
will
help
me
back
to
my
husband
bowers
threw
up
her
hands
and
looked
at
her
coadjutor
in
villainy
sadly
you
see
she
is
still
as
mad
as
a
march
hare
he
answered
and
would
you
believe
it
alice
dear
our
little
sister
has
so
imposed
on
these
good
people
with
her
cunning
insanity
that
they
actually
believe
her
stories
and
look
upon
me
her
devoted
brother
as
a
perjured
villain
seeking
her
destruction
they
will
not
even
permit
me
to
remove
my
poor
demented
sister
home
without
proof
of
my
assertion
bowers
looked
around
at
the
farmer
and
his
wife
with
an
air
of
indulgent
pity
oh
my
good
people
is
it
possible
that
you
have
been
so
weak
as
to
let
this
cunning
maniac
deceive
you
but
no
wonder
for
insanity
has
baffled
wiser
heads
than
yours
or
mine
it
is
quite
natural
she
should
deceive
you
as
i
do
not
suppose
you
ever
saw
a
crazy
person
before
but
now
let
me
assure
you
that
my
brother
has
told
you
the
simple
truth
this
is
our
own
sister
and
she
has
been
a
year
insane
she
escaped
from
us
this
morning
before
daylight
and
he
has
been
seeking
her
everywhere
i
have
come
in
the
carriage
and
i
suppose
you
will
not
now
raise
any
further
objection
to
our
removing
her
to
her
home
i
will
not
go
with
you
exclaimed
queenie
filled
with
terror
lest
the
woman
specious
acting
should
deceive
the
simple
country
people
every
word
you
have
uttered
is
a
base
falsehood
i
am
nothing
to
either
of
you
nothing
go
away
and
leave
me
in
peace
in
her
wild
excitement
she
sprang
up
and
shook
her
hands
violently
at
bowers
her
loose
disheveled
hair
her
flashing
eyes
her
waving
hands
made
her
look
like
a
wild
creature
bowers
pointed
at
her
triumphantly
you
see
for
yourselves
that
she
is
mad
she
said
she
is
going
off
into
one
of
her
violent
and
dangerous
fits
and
she
is
just
as
apt
as
not
to
catch
up
a
knife
from
the
table
there
and
kill
one
of
you
oh
for
god
sake
brother
take
her
and
put
her
in
the
carriage
leon
vinton
advanced
to
do
her
bidding
but
queenie
fought
him
off
like
a
young
lioness
at
bay
oh
good
people
she
cried
help
me
for
heaven
sake
do
not
suffer
this
villain
to
take
me
i
have
given
you
full
proof
now
that
this
is
my
sister
exclaimed
leon
vinton
to
the
farmer
i
warn
you
if
you
interfere
with
me
further
it
will
be
at
your
peril
the
farmer
and
his
wife
had
been
completely
deceived
by
the
spirited
and
natural
acting
of
bowers
they
began
to
believe
that
they
had
indeed
been
deceived
into
believing
the
artful
ravings
of
a
violent
maniac
therefore
when
queenie
called
on
them
for
help
they
only
stood
aloof
regarding
her
frightened
excited
aspect
with
fear
ha
so
you
are
now
convinced
of
the
truth
exclaimed
leon
vinton
triumphantly
seeing
that
they
made
no
effort
to
molest
him
yes
sir
we
are
said
the
farmer
in
a
conciliatory
tone
and
i
wish
to
make
my
apology
to
you
for
the
trouble
i
put
you
to
the
young
girl
acting
was
very
but
i
see
now
that
you
told
the
truth
about
her
i
told
you
so
father
exclaimed
jennie
triumphantly
tut
tut
jen
hold
your
tongue
you
impudent
girl
exclaimed
thorn
sharply
queenie
had
dropped
into
a
chair
at
the
farmer
renunciation
of
her
claims
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
burst
into
a
passionate
fit
of
weeping
bowers
stood
by
her
making
a
pretended
effort
at
consoling
her
but
her
pretended
brother
paid
no
heed
to
the
wretched
girl
he
looked
at
jennie
bright
pretty
face
and
then
turned
to
her
father
i
think
you
said
your
daughter
was
out
of
a
place
at
present
he
said
blandly
do
you
wish
to
secure
another
one
for
her
yes
we
do
was
the
ready
answer
we
have
to
put
her
out
to
service
for
we
can
not
afford
to
keep
her
at
home
she
must
earn
her
clothes
and
a
bit
more
to
help
us
along
at
home
i
think
my
sister
needs
just
such
a
girl
about
the
house
to
help
her
with
the
housekeeping
said
leon
vinton
and
turning
to
bowers
he
said
do
you
think
miss
jennie
would
suit
you
the
woman
stared
at
him
in
surprise
for
a
moment
but
he
gave
her
a
significant
glance
and
she
answered
with
apparent
frankness
yes
i
think
i
should
like
to
have
her
very
much
very
well
then
and
turning
to
the
farmer
he
inquired
if
his
sister
could
have
jennie
naming
a
liberal
but
not
too
large
compensation
for
fear
of
exciting
suspicion
he
did
not
ask
the
girl
herself
for
he
had
already
read
her
consent
in
her
beaming
eyes
she
was
perfectly
fascinated
by
the
handsome
stranger
and
was
ready
to
go
anywhere
that
she
might
daily
see
him
and
hear
his
voice
before
the
farmer
could
speak
queenie
sprang
to
his
side
and
laid
her
delicate
white
hand
all
sparkling
with
jewels
on
his
coarse
sleeve
lifting
her
blue
eyes
pleadingly
to
his
face
oh
sir
she
said
you
think
me
mad
but
for
heaven
sake
be
warned
by
me
do
not
suffer
your
pretty
simple
girl
to
stray
into
the
snare
this
man
and
woman
are
setting
for
her
if
you
give
your
consent
you
will
rue
it
in
dust
and
ashes
when
you
see
her
innocence
betrayed
and
her
virtue
lost
leon
vinton
glared
at
her
fiercely
as
the
farmer
hesitated
come
decide
at
once
he
said
the
carriage
is
waiting
and
she
can
accompany
us
if
you
are
willing
of
course
you
need
pay
no
attention
to
the
ravings
of
that
poor
maniac
thorn
looked
at
his
daughter
her
face
was
bright
with
smiles
for
the
artful
villain
with
his
tender
glances
had
made
her
believe
that
he
was
deeply
enamored
of
her
charms
do
you
want
to
go
jennie
he
asked
doubtfully
oh
yes
father
if
you
let
me
she
said
she
may
go
for
a
month
then
and
if
she
do
like
the
place
she
may
come
home
again
said
the
farmer
queenie
said
no
more
she
saw
that
her
enemies
had
triumphed
over
her
this
time
and
her
heart
was
almost
broken
she
made
an
ineffectual
struggle
to
escape
through
the
door
but
was
captured
and
borne
struggling
to
the
carriage
followed
by
her
pretended
sister
and
the
pretty
jennie
who
was
falling
so
unconsciously
into
the
pit
spread
for
her
unwary
feet
chapter
xvi
jennie
thorn
was
delighted
with
the
beautiful
furnishing
and
elegant
ease
of
the
cottage
by
the
river
bowers
proved
to
be
one
of
the
most
indulgent
of
mistresses
and
the
girl
position
speedily
became
a
sinecure
as
far
as
work
was
concerned
at
first
she
was
given
a
few
light
tasks
to
avert
suspicions
and
lead
her
to
think
that
everything
was
right
then
bowers
began
to
flatter
her
and
one
day
she
said
you
are
too
pretty
and
refined
jennie
to
stay
in
the
kitchen
with
that
vulgar
cook
you
shall
stay
in
the
parlor
and
be
my
companion
nothing
could
have
pleased
the
vain
little
creature
better
for
she
thought
that
her
master
would
respect
her
more
in
her
new
situation
and
also
that
she
would
have
more
frequent
opportunities
of
seeing
him
than
had
fallen
to
her
lot
in
her
menial
position
she
accordingly
consented
with
delight
leon
vinton
had
played
his
cards
very
cleverly
to
win
the
pretty
daughter
she
saw
him
very
seldom
at
first
as
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
in
town
only
visiting
the
cottage
two
or
three
times
in
the
space
of
a
week
on
the
occasion
of
these
visits
jennie
saw
but
little
of
him
but
some
glance
of
his
eye
or
tender
smile
made
her
heart
beat
fast
and
kept
him
in
her
thoughts
when
he
was
away
but
when
the
little
maid
was
promoted
to
the
parlor
leon
vinton
began
to
appear
at
home
more
frequently
he
lounged
about
the
parlor
with
his
cigar
and
newspaper
and
chatted
a
great
deal
with
his
pretended
sister
and
her
pretty
little
companion
very
often
bowers
would
leave
the
room
and
remain
away
for
hours
leaving
the
handsome
man
and
susceptible
girl
alone
together
on
one
of
these
occasions
he
threw
away
his
cigar
and
took
a
seat
by
jennie
she
looked
up
from
a
trifle
of
sewing
in
her
hand
and
then
with
a
deep
blush
let
her
glance
fall
to
the
rich
velvet
carpet
vinton
looked
at
her
admiringly
bowers
had
presented
her
with
a
fine
cashmere
dress
and
with
soft
white
laces
at
throat
and
wrists
and
a
few
ribbons
the
little
country
girl
looked
quite
the
lady
leon
vinton
confessed
to
himself
that
she
was
wonderfully
pretty
in
her
new
surroundings
they
suited
her
beauty
much
better
than
the
homely
humble
had
done
jennie
he
said
abruptly
do
you
know
that
the
probationary
month
which
your
father
allowed
you
with
us
is
at
an
end
she
started
and
looked
at
him
the
pretty
pink
color
fading
from
her
cheeks
a
look
of
alarm
in
her
dark
eyes
yes
i
know
she
faltered
and
you
you
not
pleased
with
me
and
you
going
to
send
me
home
to
father
i
suppose
he
smiled
at
the
piteous
quiver
in
the
girl
voice
i
send
you
if
you
want
to
go
he
said
laughing
i
do
want
to
go
i
like
to
stay
here
with
with
your
sister
she
answered
quickly
well
i
do
blame
you
he
said
this
kind
of
life
is
better
suited
to
you
than
that
you
too
pretty
and
dainty
by
george
to
be
working
around
in
people
kitchens
she
did
not
answer
save
by
a
blush
and
a
smile
of
gratified
vanity
little
jennie
he
said
after
a
moment
how
would
you
like
to
live
here
always
and
never
have
any
work
to
do
nothing
to
do
but
adorn
your
beauty
with
silks
and
laces
and
jewels
and
ride
and
walk
and
amuse
yourself
she
clasped
her
little
hands
and
looked
at
him
with
beaming
eyes
and
a
happy
smile
on
her
red
lips
oh
i
should
like
it
above
anything
she
breathed
gladly
he
took
her
hand
in
his
then
dropped
it
with
a
slight
frown
it
was
hardened
and
enlarged
by
honest
toil
and
not
pretty
like
her
face
he
was
used
to
velvet
hands
white
as
the
lily
for
he
seldom
descended
to
women
in
her
station
of
life
she
did
not
see
the
slight
curl
of
his
lip
for
he
turned
his
head
away
and
when
he
looked
back
he
was
smiling
and
there
was
a
beam
of
tenderness
in
his
eyes
jennie
dearest
he
said
you
can
have
all
that
and
what
is
better
you
can
have
one
fond
devoted
heart
to
adore
you
if
you
will
only
speak
the
word
she
looked
up
blushing
and
smiling
you
mean
she
said
and
then
paused
i
mean
he
answered
that
i
will
lavish
every
luxury
and
pleasure
upon
you
if
you
will
only
accept
my
love
the
simple
untutored
country
girl
did
not
for
a
moment
comprehend
his
meaning
she
turned
to
him
with
clasped
hands
and
a
face
full
of
joyful
emotion
oh
sir
she
said
fervently
you
know
that
i
shall
only
be
too
happy
and
thankful
to
be
your
wife
the
devil
exclaimed
the
villain
to
himself
the
little
simpleton
thinks
i
meant
marriage
it
suddenly
dawned
on
him
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
love
with
this
honest
little
country
girl
without
marriage
he
determined
to
humor
her
fancy
so
you
will
be
my
wife
my
sweet
one
he
inquired
yes
she
replied
i
will
marry
you
if
father
is
willing
vinton
suddenly
assumed
an
expression
of
deep
concern
ah
my
little
darling
he
said
as
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
ruby
lips
that
is
just
where
the
trouble
comes
in
if
i
marry
you
now
as
my
ardent
love
prompts
me
to
do
i
can
not
ask
your
father
to
give
you
to
me
for
our
marriage
must
be
a
secret
unknown
to
any
but
ourselves
why
so
she
inquired
looking
disappointed
i
can
not
tell
you
the
reason
now
jennie
he
replied
evasively
there
are
several
things
which
would
prevent
our
marriage
if
i
declared
our
intention
beforehand
but
there
is
one
reason
i
can
give
you
my
sister
though
she
is
fond
of
you
in
her
way
would
never
consent
to
it
she
is
very
proud
and
she
wishes
me
to
marry
a
rich
woman
of
her
choosing
if
i
openly
defy
her
she
has
the
power
to
keep
me
out
of
my
fortune
and
make
me
a
poor
man
jennie
was
too
simple
and
innocent
to
be
undeceived
by
that
transparent
lie
darling
after
this
explanation
you
will
surely
consent
to
a
private
marriage
will
you
not
remember
how
well
i
love
you
pleaded
the
wretch
how
could
we
manage
a
secret
marriage
asked
jennie
blushing
with
delight
at
his
fond
words
easily
enough
you
can
tell
my
sister
that
you
wish
to
go
home
and
spend
a
week
with
your
parents
then
i
can
take
you
to
the
city
right
away
and
marry
you
we
can
spend
a
week
traveling
about
and
enjoying
our
honeymoon
after
which
i
can
send
you
back
here
and
bowers
will
think
that
you
have
been
at
the
farm
the
whole
time
when
my
affairs
get
straight
we
will
declare
our
marriage
to
everybody
by
george
how
surprised
they
will
be
then
now
my
dear
little
wife
that
is
to
be
will
you
consent
to
my
plan
jennie
hesitated
a
moment
then
murmured
a
timid
and
joyful
yes
chapter
xvii
the
summer
sunshine
waned
the
summer
roses
faded
and
the
melancholy
days
the
saddest
of
the
year
hurried
swiftly
on
the
chilling
winds
howled
drearily
about
the
river
cottage
but
long
ere
the
last
autumn
leaf
was
whirled
from
the
tall
trees
standing
round
about
like
giant
sentinels
the
fickle
fancy
that
leon
vinton
had
felt
for
the
daughter
had
perished
like
the
frailest
flower
of
the
summer
the
illusion
was
soon
over
he
said
to
himself
it
was
the
briefest
fancy
i
ever
had
but
that
was
her
own
fault
she
was
too
easily
won
the
game
was
not
worth
the
candle
simple
little
jennie
had
been
living
in
a
fool
paradise
ever
since
the
which
the
deceiver
had
duly
caused
to
be
celebrated
ostensibly
she
remained
as
the
companion
of
bowers
and
that
kind
lady
appeared
to
be
perfectly
blind
and
deaf
to
all
the
strange
things
that
went
on
around
her
if
jennie
had
not
been
the
most
innocent
of
women
she
could
not
have
failed
to
know
that
bowers
was
perfectly
cognizant
of
her
secret
and
was
only
laughing
in
her
sleeve
all
the
while
that
she
appeared
so
stupid
and
to
the
new
victim
of
her
employer
i
am
heartily
tired
of
the
little
fool
he
said
to
her
one
day
in
confidence
when
the
autumn
days
had
given
place
to
the
freezing
ones
of
winter
i
wish
i
could
get
rid
of
her
your
fancy
was
soon
over
this
time
remarked
bowers
her
own
fault
grumbled
the
wretch
in
the
first
place
she
was
too
lightly
won
in
love
more
than
half
the
pleasure
lies
in
the
pursuit
and
won
is
lightly
lost
she
is
changed
now
also
how
rosy
and
bright
she
was
at
first
how
pale
how
altered
how
plain
she
is
now
she
is
said
bowers
in
a
significant
tone
the
deuce
exclaimed
leon
vinton
angrily
why
then
i
surely
get
rid
of
her
but
how
to
do
it
that
the
question
tell
her
the
truth
that
she
is
not
married
at
all
and
send
her
home
to
her
parents
said
the
woman
heartlessly
he
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
but
paused
to
light
a
cigar
and
place
it
between
his
lips
then
he
threw
himself
back
on
the
lounge
where
he
sat
and
remarked
indifferently
yes
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
do
that
there
will
be
a
scene
i
suppose
bowers
merely
laughed
in
reply
as
if
he
had
uttered
the
most
harmless
jest
she
was
thoroughly
wicked
and
heartless
and
cared
not
a
jot
for
the
miseries
of
the
whole
world
well
the
sooner
the
better
went
on
vinton
heartlessly
i
believe
i
go
and
have
it
out
with
her
now
he
arose
as
heartlessly
and
indifferently
as
if
he
were
going
about
a
mission
of
happiness
instead
of
being
about
to
strike
the
cold
steel
of
despair
into
the
young
heart
that
trusted
him
so
fondly
jennie
was
sitting
by
a
window
in
the
parlor
looking
out
at
the
great
blinding
flakes
of
snow
that
whirled
through
the
air
and
covered
the
ground
with
a
pure
white
carpet
she
looked
pale
but
very
pretty
in
a
black
dress
with
scarlet
trimmings
and
a
scarlet
shawl
was
draped
about
her
shoulders
partly
concealing
her
form
as
vinton
entered
the
room
her
dark
eyes
turned
from
the
window
and
rested
on
him
with
a
very
fond
and
loving
smile
you
come
at
last
she
said
in
a
tone
of
joy
and
relief
where
have
you
been
all
this
long
week
in
town
he
answered
laconically
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
near
her
a
look
of
disappointment
came
into
her
eyes
she
rose
and
went
to
his
side
winding
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
pressing
her
lips
on
his
brow
i
missed
you
so
much
she
said
lovingly
i
let
you
leave
me
so
long
again
i
shall
not
ask
your
leave
he
answered
sharply
and
muttering
an
oath
between
his
teeth
as
he
rudely
pushed
her
off
the
movement
was
so
sudden
that
she
nearly
fell
it
was
only
by
catching
the
back
of
a
convenient
chair
that
she
steadied
herself
she
turned
a
white
frightened
face
toward
him
what
the
matter
she
said
are
you
angry
with
me
leon
i
sick
of
your
baby
fondness
he
answered
brutally
have
done
with
it
jennie
fell
back
into
her
chair
as
if
shot
and
looked
at
him
with
reproachful
eyes
you
angry
with
me
she
said
plaintively
and
i
had
something
to
tell
you
something
very
particular
tell
it
then
he
answered
with
a
frown
as
black
as
night
on
his
handsome
face
the
trembling
young
creature
before
him
remained
silent
for
a
few
minutes
so
utterly
confounded
was
she
by
the
unaccountable
change
in
her
husband
his
manner
had
always
been
the
perfection
of
gentlemanly
refinement
before
this
sudden
change
to
coarse
brutality
amazed
and
frightened
her
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
low
and
broken
and
her
eyes
rested
on
the
carpet
i
waited
to
tell
you
leon
she
said
with
a
scarlet
blush
that
that
we
will
have
to
make
some
change
soon
you
be
obliged
to
tell
bowers
that
we
are
married
or
take
me
to
some
other
place
if
you
do
she
find
out
our
secret
pretty
soon
we
are
compelled
to
make
a
change
i
have
been
thinking
so
myself
he
answered
coolly
you
have
she
said
with
an
accent
of
gladness
then
what
do
you
think
we
had
better
do
i
think
you
had
better
go
home
to
your
mother
he
answered
brutally
she
looked
up
at
him
in
surprise
and
doubt
you
mean
to
own
our
marriage
then
do
you
she
asked
and
there
was
a
faint
suggestion
of
hope
in
her
tone
no
by
george
i
do
he
answered
quickly
you
do
she
exclaimed
then
how
can
i
go
home
they
would
they
would
think
i
had
disgraced
myself
father
would
turn
me
out
of
doors
i
very
sorry
for
you
then
he
answered
coolly
i
see
no
other
resource
for
you
leon
i
do
know
what
you
mean
exclaimed
jennie
in
surprise
and
pain
at
his
careless
words
and
utterly
indifferent
manner
you
are
not
one
bit
like
yourself
what
makes
you
talk
so
strange
to
your
own
wife
she
looked
up
at
the
handsome
man
with
the
tears
of
wounded
feeling
starting
into
her
eyes
but
all
unconscious
of
the
terrible
blow
that
was
to
fall
upon
her
defenseless
head
you
are
not
my
wife
he
replied
with
a
dark
and
threatening
frown
your
wife
she
cried
turning
as
white
as
death
oh
leon
you
surely
are
going
mad
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
what
i
say
he
answered
curtly
it
time
you
knew
the
truth
jennie
you
are
not
my
wife
never
have
been
the
marriage
ceremony
was
read
over
us
to
be
sure
but
it
was
only
a
to
quiet
your
scruples
the
pretended
preacher
was
a
friend
of
mine
the
wickedest
blade
in
town
with
a
soul
as
black
as
the
devil
she
sat
still
and
looked
at
him
her
eyes
wild
and
frightened
her
face
as
white
as
the
snow
which
whirled
past
the
window
at
last
she
spoke
but
her
voice
was
low
and
thick
and
did
not
seem
like
her
own
you
joking
with
me
leon
you
mean
it
i
mean
it
it
the
truth
he
replied
coolly
come
now
jennie
do
take
it
hard
we
had
a
pleasant
time
have
we
not
and
now
you
can
go
home
to
your
mother
i
am
tired
of
you
i
confess
it
and
i
going
away
myself
to
europe
i
think
so
of
course
you
ca
stay
here
my
sister
would
turn
you
out
of
doors
as
soon
as
she
found
you
out
go
home
to
the
farm
and
there
a
hundred
dollars
to
help
you
through
your
trouble
he
tossed
a
roll
of
into
her
lap
with
a
complacent
air
as
if
his
munificent
generosity
condoned
everything
the
girl
had
been
sitting
quite
still
looking
at
him
with
a
terrible
pain
frozen
on
her
pretty
young
face
but
at
his
concluding
words
she
sprang
up
and
tossed
the
roll
of
notes
into
the
fire
as
if
it
had
been
a
serpent
her
dark
eyes
blazed
with
passion
and
her
voice
shook
with
rage
as
she
wildly
confronted
her
base
betrayer
oh
you
devil
she
cried
i
would
not
touch
one
cent
of
that
money
to
save
your
soul
from
the
torments
of
hell
my
curses
be
upon
your
head
may
the
lord
forgive
you
for
this
cruel
sin
may
you
die
by
the
hangman
rope
the
handsome
villain
laughed
mockingly
and
turning
on
his
heel
walked
out
of
the
room
as
he
passed
through
the
hallway
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
heavy
fall
glancing
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
that
his
victim
had
fallen
senseless
upon
the
floor
he
walked
on
and
entered
the
room
of
bowers
his
housekeeper
and
not
his
sister
as
he
had
pretended
i
have
told
her
he
said
and
she
has
fainted
as
they
mostly
do
i
am
going
away
now
and
i
shall
be
absent
a
week
you
must
try
and
get
her
away
from
here
before
i
come
back
oh
you
wicked
man
said
bowers
laughing
and
shaking
a
finger
at
him
where
shall
i
send
her
to
the
devil
for
aught
i
care
said
the
gentleman
smarting
with
the
recollection
of
jennie
curse
and
the
burning
of
his
hundred
dollars
i
care
not
where
she
goes
so
that
i
am
rid
of
her
but
take
good
care
of
the
other
one
do
not
suffer
her
to
escape
he
tossed
a
roll
of
bills
into
her
lap
and
walked
away
humming
a
tune
in
a
few
minutes
after
she
heard
him
riding
off
down
the
road
to
the
city
she
locked
her
money
carefully
away
in
a
drawer
then
went
up
to
the
parlor
where
poor
jennie
lay
insensible
upon
the
floor
and
sitting
down
in
an
carelessly
regarded
the
poor
girl
whom
she
had
pitilessly
helped
to
ruin
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
unhappy
girl
revived
from
her
deep
swoon
but
the
housekeeper
made
no
effort
to
restore
her
to
life
though
the
thought
crossed
her
mind
more
than
once
as
she
sat
there
that
she
might
die
without
assistance
and
no
matter
if
she
does
said
the
heartless
woman
to
herself
it
would
be
all
the
better
for
her
and
for
all
parties
concerned
but
it
was
not
to
be
as
bowers
thought
and
almost
wished
life
came
back
to
the
poor
girl
with
a
long
fluttering
sigh
and
the
first
thing
she
saw
when
she
looked
up
was
the
angry
face
of
the
woman
glaring
down
upon
her
so
you
alive
are
you
she
said
fiercely
why
did
you
die
and
hide
your
shame
and
disgrace
in
the
grave
faltered
poor
jane
blankly
i
say
why
did
you
die
and
hide
your
shame
and
disgrace
in
the
grave
repeated
the
housekeeper
angrily
ah
i
found
you
out
jennie
thorn
i
took
you
in
my
house
for
an
honest
girl
but
ruined
yourself
and
disgraced
your
poor
old
parents
i
not
keep
such
trash
in
my
respectable
home
out
of
my
house
you
go
before
night
the
poor
girl
rose
and
looked
out
of
the
window
the
cold
winter
twilight
was
already
falling
and
the
great
white
flakes
of
snow
still
filled
the
air
oh
bowers
she
said
piteously
it
is
night
already
and
where
could
i
go
you
should
have
thought
of
that
sooner
said
the
pitiless
woman
too
late
now
go
get
your
cloak
and
hat
and
put
them
on
almost
stunned
by
her
sorrow
jennie
mechanically
obeyed
her
imperious
command
now
leave
here
said
the
housekeeper
oh
bowers
cried
the
wretched
girl
let
me
stay
at
least
until
morning
indeed
i
am
not
what
you
think
me
i
was
deceived
by
a
and
i
thought
myself
an
honest
wife
until
vinton
told
me
just
now
how
cruelly
he
had
betrayed
me
oh
for
god
sake
have
pity
on
me
and
do
turn
me
out
in
the
cold
and
the
darkness
for
all
answer
bowers
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
rudely
dragged
her
along
the
hall
to
the
front
door
you
ca
deceive
me
with
your
trumped
up
lies
you
shameless
thing
she
said
go
now
and
never
let
me
see
your
face
here
again
she
opened
the
door
and
pushing
the
poor
weeping
betrayed
and
deserted
girl
out
into
the
blinding
storm
slammed
and
locked
the
door
chapter

over
the
broad
dark
river
and
the
earth
the
cold
winter
moonlight
lay
in
great
silvery
bars
of
light
the
terrible
snowstorm
of
two
days
before
was
over
the
sky
was
clear
and
starry
and
no
trace
remained
of
the
storm
save
the
deep
white
carpeting
of
the
beautiful
snow
midnight
was
tolling
from
the
great
bell
in
the
city
but
queenie
ernscliffe
sat
at
her
window
staring
out
at
the
night
with
wide
sleepless
eyes
on
a
couch
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
lay
bowers
snoring
audibly
she
had
slept
in
queenie
room
ever
since
the
night
she
had
effected
her
escape
and
her
constant
vigilance
had
entirely
frustrated
any
other
attempt
of
the
kind
while
jennie
thorn
had
been
dwelling
in
her
fool
paradise
our
heroine
had
been
suffering
all
the
horrors
of
imprisonment
and
despair
she
had
heard
very
little
of
the
farmer
pretty
daughter
since
the
day
she
came
to
live
there
but
she
knew
she
had
remained
with
them
for
she
had
seen
her
a
few
times
walking
in
the
garden
beneath
her
window
prettily
even
richly
dressed
and
she
knew
too
well
what
that
meant
she
felt
very
sorry
for
the
poor
girl
who
had
been
so
deaf
to
her
words
of
friendly
warning
queenie
was
sadly
altered
for
the
worse
since
these
long
months
of
imprisonment
and
wretchedness
her
garments
hung
loosely
about
her
attenuated
form
her
cheeks
were
thin
and
hollow
and
her
once
bright
eyes
were
dim
with
weeping
and
looked
too
wild
and
large
for
her
small
pathetic
white
face
her
days
and
nights
were
passed
in
sleepless
wretchedness
much
to
the
annoyance
of
the
housekeeper
who
declared
that
she
could
not
rest
well
while
her
refractory
charge
kept
the
light
burning
as
she
did
the
long
nights
through
for
she
could
not
bear
to
have
darkness
add
its
additional
gloom
to
the
horror
of
her
thoughts
while
she
sat
and
stared
wearily
out
at
the
midnight
scene
the
housekeeper
snored
herself
awake
and
began
to
complain
mercy
sake
girl
go
to
bed
and
put
the
light
out
i
declare
i
can
not
sleep
a
wink
with
the
gas
shining
in
my
eyes
you
have
been
uninterruptedly
for
several
hours
answered
queenie
coldly
how
do
you
suppose
i
can
sleep
when
you
keep
up
such
a
noise
with
your
breathing
well
i
never
exclaimed
bowers
this
is
the
first
time
i
was
ever
accused
of
snoring
queenie
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
presently
she
turned
her
head
around
and
said
abruptly
mrs
bowers
bowers
who
was
falling
asleep
again
gave
a
grunt
in
token
that
she
heard
what
has
become
of
that
pretty
girl
you
brought
home
from
farmer
thorn
she
went
away
two
days
ago
was
the
sleepy
reply
with
leon
vinton
i
presume
said
queenie
scornfully
no
she
went
alone
betrayed
and
abandoned
no
doubt
said
queenie
bitterly
something
like
that
certainly
answered
the
housekeeper
carelessly
and
with
that
she
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
again
leaving
queenie
to
her
own
reflections
they
were
not
pleasant
ones
certainly
the
room
was
chilly
and
she
took
up
a
shawl
wrapped
it
about
her
shoulders
and
went
back
to
her
lonely
vigil
pressing
her
forehead
against
the
pane
while
she
looked
out
into
the
cold
winter
night
oh
to
be
out
there
in
the
night
and
the
cold
and
the
darkness
she
murmured
oh
to
feel
the
breath
of
freedom
on
my
brow
once
more
and
hope
within
my
heart
how
lonely
how
dreary
everything
seems
she
went
on
how
dark
and
dreary
the
river
looks
except
where
the
bars
of
moonlight
touch
it
with
brightness
how
ghostly
and
the
trees
appear
tossing
their
naked
arms
in
the
breeze
how
weird
and
melancholy
the
silent
deserted
earth
looks
at
midnight
suddenly
she
started
and
uttered
a
low
cry
she
fancied
that
she
had
seen
a
dark
form
darting
cautiously
about
the
garden
beneath
the
windows
she
looked
out
again
and
for
a
moment
she
thought
herself
mistaken
but
directly
the
dark
form
of
a
man
appeared
from
behind
a
tree
and
skirting
a
strip
of
moonlight
with
cautious
footsteps
disappeared
in
the
shadows
what
can
that
man
be
after
she
thought
it
is
not
leon
vinton
whom
then
can
it
be
perhaps
a
burglar
she
continued
to
watch
for
him
and
presently
she
saw
him
take
up
his
station
under
a
tree
near
the
gate
as
if
watching
or
waiting
for
someone
it
must
be
a
burglar
she
said
to
herself
he
is
waiting
for
his
accomplice
to
come
that
they
may
rob
the
house
shall
i
wake
bowers
and
tell
her
she
mused
a
moment
still
watching
the
dark
mysterious
form
lurking
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
near
the
gate
no
i
will
not
tell
her
she
concluded
what
does
it
matter
to
me
i
care
not
what
they
do
perhaps
they
may
enter
this
room
and
by
some
means
i
may
effect
my
escape
her
heart
began
to
beat
at
the
thought
and
the
light
of
hope
came
into
her
beautiful
eyes
brightening
her
whole
face
she
continued
to
watch
the
mysterious
figure
expecting
every
minute
to
see
his
accomplice
appear
on
the
scene
but
the
hours
passed
slowly
by
and
the
man
still
remained
at
his
post
alone
at
the
first
peep
of
dawn
he
went
away
leaving
queenie
perplexed
and
doubtful
who
can
it
be
she
asked
herself
it
seems
quite
evident
that
he
is
not
here
for
the
purpose
of
robbery
what
then
is
he
after
can
it
be
some
friend
of
mine
the
thought
overpowered
her
with
joy
oh
why
did
i
not
raise
the
window
and
give
him
some
signal
she
thought
then
she
remembered
that
the
windows
had
been
tightly
fastened
down
by
leon
vinton
orders
so
that
she
could
not
raise
them
i
have
suffered
my
hopes
to
lead
my
reason
astray
she
thought
then
with
sudden
despair
of
course
it
is
not
anyone
to
help
me
no
one
knows
that
i
am
living
except
leon
vinton
and
the
wicked
woman
sleeping
yonder
papa
lawrence
all
of
them
think
my
body
lies
at
this
moment
moldering
in
the
grave
oh
lawrence
oh
papa
what
would
i
not
give
to
see
you
again
she
little
dreamed
that
the
father
she
loved
so
fondly
had
died
of
a
broken
heart
over
her
loss
she
thought
of
him
every
day
and
longed
to
see
him
almost
as
she
longed
to
see
the
husband
from
whose
side
she
had
been
torn
at
the
very
altar
by
the
vindictive
malice
of
leon
vinton
the
next
day
from
her
position
at
the
window
she
saw
the
same
dark
figure
of
a
man
pass
up
and
down
before
the
cottage
at
intervals
at
least
a
dozen
times
a
broad
slouch
hat
was
pulled
over
his
brows
effectually
concealing
his
features
from
queenie
sight
the
mystery
deepens
she
thought
the
man
whoever
he
is
evidently
is
watching
this
house
but
with
what
object
i
wonder
at
night
he
appeared
again
and
passed
the
long
cold
hours
pacing
up
and
down
the
garden
until
dawn
every
day
for
four
days
the
man
kept
up
this
restless
espionage
it
seemed
to
queenie
that
he
neither
ate
nor
slept
so
constantly
did
he
appear
at
his
post
she
became
greatly
interested
in
the
mysterious
watcher
bowers
she
said
one
night
where
is
leon
vinton
in
town
i
suppose
said
the
housekeeper
when
is
he
coming
back
i
suppose
he
has
been
gone
a
week
and
he
said
that
he
would
return
in
that
time
do
you
want
to
see
him
no
indeed
i
hope
i
shall
never
see
him
again
said
queenie
shortly
turning
back
to
the
window
the
next
day
while
she
was
watching
the
mysterious
man
as
he
paced
up
and
down
the
snowy
road
opposite
the
house
she
saw
leon
vinton
ride
up
to
the
gate
dismount
and
tie
up
his
horse
involuntarily
she
looked
over
at
the
mysterious
stranger
he
was
rapidly
crossing
the
road
toward
leon
vinton
a
gust
of
wind
blew
off
his
broad
slouch
hat
and
a
startled
cry
broke
from
queenie
lips
she
had
instantly
recognized
the
man
it
was
farmer
thorn
she
instantly
comprehended
the
object
of
his
daily
and
nightly
espionage
he
was
watching
for
leon
vinton
that
he
might
avenge
the
wrongs
of
his
daughter
clasping
her
hands
in
breathless
agitation
queenie
waited
for
the
leon
vinton
opened
the
gate
and
passed
inside
farmer
thorn
having
replaced
his
hat
walked
in
behind
him
the
next
moment
leon
vinton
felt
a
grasp
of
steel
upon
his
arm
he
was
whirled
violently
around
face
to
face
with
the
enraged
man
whom
he
had
wronged
and
felt
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
pressed
against
his
breast
accursed
villain
shouted
the
farmer
in
a
voice
of
thunder
thus
do
i
avenge
a
daughter
wrongs
queenie
heard
the
terrible
words
followed
by
a
loud
report
saw
a
wreath
of
blue
smoke
curling
upward
and
leon
vinton
fell
like
a
log
on
the
snowy
path
with
a
terrible
shudder
she
saw
his
spurting
out
dyeing
the
pure
snow
with
a
terrible
scarlet
stain
farmer
thorn
looked
down
at
his
victim
spurned
him
with
his
foot
and
replacing
the
pistol
in
his
breast
walked
rapidly
away
at
the
same
moment
the
front
door
opened
hurriedly
and
bowers
ran
out
followed
by
a
servant
both
of
them
ran
screaming
down
the
path
to
the
side
of
their
master
chapter
xix
weakened
and
shocked
by
the
terrible
scene
she
had
witnessed
queenie
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
fell
back
on
her
sofa
she
lay
there
trembling
and
agitated
and
musing
on
the
sudden
end
of
the
wicked
leon
vinton
presently
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
bowers
entered
in
such
high
excitement
that
she
forgot
to
lock
the
door
behind
her
oh
she
cried
out
did
you
hear
the
pistol
shot
leon
vinton
is
dead
a
sudden
impulse
decided
queenie
to
conceal
her
knowledge
of
the
fact
she
sprang
up
in
apparent
wild
excitement
is
it
possible
she
cried
i
heard
a
a
moment
ago
who
killed
him
i
can
not
tell
you
said
bowers
i
heard
a
shot
and
ran
to
the
window
just
in
time
to
see
a
man
going
out
of
the
gate
he
had
a
wide
hat
on
and
i
could
make
out
his
features
you
shall
never
learn
his
name
from
me
thought
queenie
to
herself
for
her
whole
sympathies
were
with
the
wronged
father
of
the
poor
betrayed
jennie
but
there
laid
poor
vinton
stone
dead
in
the
path
continued
bowers
excitedly
look
out
of
the
window
there
and
you
can
see
it
all
for
yourself
queenie
glanced
out
of
the
window
and
drew
back
with
a
shudder
oh
it
is
horrible
she
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
going
to
send
for
the
coroner
said
bowers
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
i
must
go
right
away
and
do
it
dear
dear
who
was
that
murderous
man
i
like
to
know
i
have
followed
after
him
and
mayhap
caught
him
only
i
was
so
flustrated
i
did
know
what
to
do
first
the
mean
murderous
villain
she
bustled
out
so
full
of
excitement
that
she
forgot
to
lock
her
prisoner
door
queenie
started
up
full
of
joyful
emotion
now
is
my
chance
she
exclaimed
leon
vinton
is
dead
and
bowers
has
no
right
to
detain
me
i
will
leave
this
dreadful
place
at
once
she
opened
the
wardrobe
and
took
out
a
long
waterproof
cloak
and
hood
putting
them
on
with
trembling
hands
then
she
exchanged
her
thin
shoes
for
thick
walking
boots
and
doubled
a
barege
veil
over
her
face
thus
equipped
she
opened
the
door
and
ran
down
the
steps
to
the
hall
with
her
heart
beating
almost
to
suffocation
in
the
doorway
she
paused
bowers
was
standing
in
the
path
by
the
side
of
the
dead
man
and
queenie
was
afraid
she
would
attempt
to
detain
her
i
must
make
a
run
for
it
she
thought
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
she
flitted
down
the
steps
and
ran
at
speed
down
the
path
past
her
living
and
dead
persecutors
and
sprang
through
the
gate
and
out
into
the
road
bowers
heard
the
patter
of
her
feet
and
the
rustle
of
her
garments
as
she
rushed
past
her
and
looking
up
she
recognized
the
girl
and
recollected
instantly
that
she
had
forgotten
to
lock
the
door
after
her
come
back
you
jade
she
screamed
come
back
this
instant
but
the
fugitive
hurried
on
without
looking
back
and
bowers
in
a
rage
set
out
in
a
headlong
pace
after
her
but
the
good
lady
was
not
as
young
as
she
had
once
been
and
she
found
herself
rather
heavy
on
her
feet
but
panting
and
blowing
she
raced
on
in
the
useless
pursuit
until
suddenly
both
her
feet
slipped
from
under
her
and
she
measured
her
length
on
the
icy
ground
muttering
some
words
rather
spirited
in
their
meaning
and
not
often
heard
on
feminine
lips
the
wicked
woman
rose
from
the
cold
earth
and
shaking
her
fist
after
the
fast
retreating
figure
of
her
whilom
prisoner
began
to
retrace
her
steps
to
the
house
rubbing
sundry
bruises
on
her
person
as
she
went
the
little
wretch
she
thought
how
quick
she
was
to
take
advantage
of
my
momentary
forgetfulness
but
after
all
vinton
is
dead
and
what
do
i
want
to
keep
her
for
i
shall
have
to
leave
here
anyway
mayhap
it
better
as
it
is
thus
consoling
herself
she
returned
to
her
watch
over
the
dead
man
who
lay
in
a
crimson
pool
of
his
across
the
snowy
path
his
eyes
glaring
glassily
his
handsome
face
set
in
the
expression
of
fear
and
horror
that
had
settled
on
it
when
thorn
terrible
denunciation
had
been
thundered
in
his
ears
meanwhile
queenie
ran
on
in
her
headlong
flight
until
her
limbs
began
to
tremble
beneath
her
throwing
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
she
saw
that
she
had
outrun
her
pursuer
so
far
that
she
was
no
longer
visible
she
slackened
her
pace
then
and
began
to
walk
at
a
slower
and
more
reasonable
gait
i
may
take
my
time
now
she
thought
bowers
is
too
old
and
slow
to
overtake
me
besides
she
can
have
no
interest
in
keeping
me
a
prisoner
since
leon
vinton
is
dead
she
will
have
enough
to
do
to
take
care
of
herself
she
pushed
back
her
veil
showing
a
face
so
bright
with
hope
and
happiness
that
it
was
hardly
recognizable
for
the
pale
and
dejected
countenance
that
had
looked
from
the
window
of
the
river
cottage
an
hour
ago
joy
had
fairly
transfigured
it
she
walked
along
unconscious
of
the
keen
cold
wintery
air
in
the
rush
of
happy
thoughts
that
crowded
over
her
she
would
go
home
to
her
father
first
she
would
tell
him
everything
he
should
break
the
news
of
her
return
to
her
husband
i
can
not
tell
lawrence
the
truth
she
said
shuddering
i
would
rather
die
than
that
he
should
know
the
terrible
secret
he
is
so
proud
and
he
told
me
once
he
would
not
marry
a
woman
with
the
faintest
shadow
of
disgrace
upon
her
name
i
have
deceived
him
and
i
must
never
let
him
know
now
for
i
love
him
and
it
would
kill
me
to
have
him
put
me
away
i
will
tell
him
something
plausible
though
i
will
not
tell
a
direct
lie
if
i
can
help
poor
little
queenie
once
so
innocent
and
transparent
that
her
very
thoughts
could
be
read
in
her
eyes
her
terrible
misfortunes
had
taught
her
strange
subterfuges
and
deceit
i
wonder
if
there
will
be
any
trouble
about
proving
my
identity
she
thought
i
have
heard
of
such
things
and
it
appear
very
strange
to
them
at
first
papa
will
take
me
for
a
ghost
as
he
did
the
night
i
went
and
looked
at
him
through
the
window
when
he
thought
i
was
traveling
in
europe
poor
uncle
rob
i
wonder
if
he
was
sorry
much
when
he
heard
i
was
dead
she
passed
the
where
the
thorns
lived
but
the
doors
and
windows
were
both
closed
and
the
only
sign
of
life
was
a
faint
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
the
chimney
i
should
like
to
stop
and
see
what
has
become
of
that
poor
willful
girl
she
said
to
herself
but
i
am
so
impatient
i
can
not
spare
the
time
she
walked
on
faster
as
she
neared
the
great
city
her
impatience
redoubled
by
the
thought
that
every
step
brought
her
nearer
to
her
loved
ones
i
wonder
if
they
will
be
glad
to
see
me
she
thought
wistfully
i
know
papa
poor
old
darling
i
could
never
doubt
i
do
not
know
about
georgie
and
mamma
perhaps
were
relieved
that
i
and
my
terrible
secret
were
buried
together
they
may
be
sorry
to
see
me
resurrected
but
of
one
thing
i
am
certain
sydney
was
glad
when
she
thought
i
was
dead
she
will
hate
me
more
than
ever
when
i
go
back
but
i
shall
not
trouble
any
of
them
i
shall
have
my
husband
he
is
all
i
want
he
shall
take
me
away
from
here
to
some
other
place
where
i
can
forget
all
the
terrible
past
in
my
new
happiness
all
the
while
she
was
thinking
she
was
walking
quickly
on
buoyed
up
by
the
joyous
anticipations
at
last
and
weary
she
entered
the
great
city
and
walked
on
until
she
stood
in
front
of
her
handsome
residence
trembling
with
passionate
joy
and
with
her
heart
beating
so
that
she
could
hear
it
in
her
ears
she
went
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
to
her
by
a
strange
man
in
livery
instead
of
the
female
servant
who
had
formerly
answered
the
bell
her
first
sensation
of
surprise
and
disappointment
was
succeeded
by
an
amusing
thought
mamma
and
sydney
are
grander
than
ever
they
have
set
up
a
is
lyle
at
home
she
timidly
inquired
the
man
stared
at
her
a
moment
in
blank
surprise
then
getting
his
wits
together
replied
respectfully
the
lyles
do
live
here
now
miss
where
have
they
removed
can
you
tell
me
she
inquired
thinking
that
perhaps
her
mother
and
sister
extravagance
had
caused
her
failure
at
last
and
that
they
had
taken
a
cheaper
house
lyle
and
miss
lyle
and
lady
valentine
are
all
in
europe
he
answered
wondering
what
made
the
bright
pretty
face
turn
so
pale
as
he
gave
her
the
information
and
lyle
you
can
tell
me
where
i
can
find
she
inquired
eagerly
the
polite
servant
looked
as
if
he
thought
the
girl
was
out
of
her
mind
after
a
blank
stare
into
her
lovely
eager
face
he
said
surprisedly
lyle
why
you
know
if
the
man
had
struck
her
the
cruelest
blow
in
the
face
she
could
not
have
recoiled
more
suddenly
she
stepped
backward
so
quickly
and
with
such
a
wild
low
cry
of
pain
that
she
would
have
fallen
down
the
steps
if
the
man
had
not
thrown
out
his
arm
and
caught
her
oh
do
take
it
hard
he
said
in
a
voice
of
respectful
sympathy
was
he
any
relation
of
yours
she
turned
her
beautiful
face
toward
him
with
the
whiteness
of
death
upon
it
when
did
he
die
she
asked
unheeding
his
question
the
same
night
that
his
daughter
died
you
heard
of
that
have
you
asked
the
man
who
seemed
rather
of
a
gossiping
turn
yes
i
heard
of
that
she
said
in
a
hollow
voice
totally
unlike
her
own
well
lyle
he
died
that
same
night
of
a
broken
heart
folk
said
she
was
his
youngest
daughter
and
his
favorite
they
were
both
buried
the
same
day
dead
dead
she
murmured
what
did
you
say
asked
the
man
not
hearing
the
low
words
nothing
she
answered
i
thank
you
for
your
information
and
staggered
down
the
steps
into
the
street
again
dead
dead
she
kept
moaning
to
herself
as
she
staggered
along
the
street
in
white
tearless
despair
papa
is
dead
and
died
of
a
broken
heart
for
me
oh
i
was
not
worth
such
devotion
her
mind
was
so
full
of
this
terrible
blow
that
had
fallen
upon
her
that
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
until
suddenly
she
saw
that
the
brief
winter
twilight
was
settling
fast
over
everything
then
a
terror
of
the
night
and
cold
took
hold
of
her
she
thought
of
her
husband
they
are
all
gone
papa
and
the
rest
she
murmured
i
have
no
one
but
lawrence
now
i
will
go
to
him
the
thought
seemed
to
invest
him
with
added
tenderness
and
dearness
she
hastened
her
footsteps
and
before
long
she
stood
in
front
of
the
splendid
mansion
where
captain
ernscliffe
lived
and
which
he
had
refurnished
in
splendid
style
for
his
fair
young
bride
the
windows
were
closed
as
if
the
house
was
deserted
but
she
went
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
a
woman
servant
answered
the
summons
is
captain
ernscliffe
at
home
asked
queenie
in
a
faint
and
trembling
voice
chapter
xx
the
woman
whom
queenie
had
addressed
and
who
had
the
appearance
of
being
the
housekeeper
stood
still
and
looked
at
the
young
girl
a
moment
without
replying
is
captain
ernscliffe
at
home
repeated
queenie
in
a
tone
of
wistful
eagerness
what
do
you
want
of
captain
ernscliffe
asked
the
woman
rudely
as
she
stared
suspiciously
into
the
troubled
white
face
of
the
beautiful
questioner
queenie
drew
her
slight
figure
haughtily
erect
my
business
is
with
captain
ernscliffe
she
said
in
a
cool
firm
tone
that
rebuked
the
woman
impertinent
curiosity
can
i
see
him
oh
yes
certainly
said
the
housekeeper
with
a
palpable
sneer
she
was
offended
because
queenie
had
failed
to
gratify
her
curiosity
show
me
in
at
once
then
said
queenie
making
a
motion
to
step
across
the
threshold
but
the
woman
held
the
door
in
her
hand
and
placed
herself
in
front
of
it
you
have
to
travel
many
a
mile
from
this
to
see
him
she
said
maliciously
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
queenie
turning
pale
is
he
not
at
home
i
will
wait
here
until
he
comes
then
you
wait
many
a
month
then
was
the
grim
reply
of
the
offended
woman
i
do
not
understand
you
queenie
answered
passing
her
small
hand
across
her
brow
with
a
dim
presentiment
of
coming
evil
will
you
please
tell
me
where
i
can
find
captain
ernscliffe
you
find
him
across
the
atlantic
ocean
somewhere
in
europe
she
fired
the
words
off
like
a
final
shot
and
looked
at
queenie
prepared
to
enjoy
her
chagrin
and
amazement
but
she
was
almost
frightened
by
the
expression
of
terrible
despair
that
came
over
the
beautiful
young
face
in
europe
she
said
in
a
voice
so
low
and
the
woman
could
scarcely
hear
it
are
you
sure
quite
sure
he
went
away
to
travel
a
week
after
his
death
and
may
not
return
for
years
she
made
a
motion
to
shut
the
door
intimating
that
the
conference
was
ended
but
queenie
leaned
up
against
it
so
that
she
was
compelled
to
desist
can
you
give
me
his
address
that
i
may
write
to
him
she
said
well
i
never
ejaculated
the
housekeeper
staring
at
her
in
amazement
queenie
only
repeated
her
words
more
plainly
i
know
no
more
of
his
whereabouts
than
the
dead
was
the
answer
he
expected
to
be
traveling
all
the
time
a
smothered
moan
of
pain
came
from
the
white
lips
of
the
listener
have
you
done
with
me
asked
the
woman
impatiently
queenie
looked
out
into
the
street
it
was
almost
dark
and
a
sleety
mist
was
beginning
to
fall
the
were
going
their
rounds
lighting
up
the
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
and
belated
pedestrians
were
hurrying
homeward
with
a
shiver
she
turned
back
to
the
portly
comfortable
figure
of
the
woman
rustling
on
the
in
her
black
silk
dress
quite
unconscious
that
she
was
holding
the
door
against
her
mistress
and
the
mistress
of
that
elegant
brown
stone
mansion
on
whose
threshold
she
stood
you
are
captain
ernscliffe
housekeeper
said
queenie
yes
and
i
am
left
in
charge
of
the
house
during
his
absence
answered
the
woman
bridling
with
a
sense
of
her
importance
i
am
a
friend
of
captain
ernscliffe
said
queenie
timidly
will
you
let
me
stay
here
i
am
homeless
and
penniless
the
housekeeper
favored
her
with
a
stare
of
scornful
incredulity
captain
ernscliffe
friends
are
all
rich
people
she
said
with
a
toss
of
the
head
he
do
have
any
acquaintance
with
i
assure
you
that
i
am
not
a
tramp
answered
the
young
girl
quickly
i
have
been
very
unfortunate
in
arriving
in
this
city
and
finding
my
friends
all
dead
or
away
if
your
master
were
here
he
would
certainly
give
me
shelter
this
wintery
night
it
more
than
i
do
then
said
the
housekeeper
sharply
come
young
woman
do
tell
no
more
lies
captain
ernscliffe
do
know
you
but
i
you
a
burglar
accomplice
and
you
want
to
get
into
the
house
that
you
may
open
it
to
your
friends
in
the
night
and
rob
the
house
indeed
you
are
mistaken
said
queenie
earnestly
oh
let
me
stay
if
you
do
i
shall
perish
of
cold
in
the
streets
and
my
death
will
be
on
your
hands
you
may
lock
me
into
a
room
if
you
are
afraid
of
me
only
give
me
shelter
it
had
been
on
her
mind
to
declare
herself
the
wife
of
captain
ernscliffe
and
force
the
woman
to
admit
her
into
the
house
that
was
virtually
her
own
but
a
moment
reflection
showed
the
utter
futility
of
such
a
course
no
one
except
those
who
loved
her
would
give
credence
to
such
a
wild
improbable
tale
no
one
would
believe
that
the
grave
had
given
back
its
dead
unless
she
could
offer
more
substantial
proof
than
she
had
at
command
this
woman
before
her
would
have
laughed
such
an
assertion
to
scorn
come
move
on
she
said
roughly
at
the
same
time
seizing
the
girl
by
the
shoulder
and
pushing
her
from
her
position
against
the
door
i
ca
shelter
the
likes
of
you
and
i
wo
stand
here
in
the
cold
wasting
breath
on
you
a
minute
longer
queenie
turned
as
the
woman
pushed
her
toward
the
steps
and
looked
her
in
the
eyes
you
may
be
sorry
for
this
some
day
she
said
ha
ha
laughed
the
heartless
housekeeper
sorry
indeed
sorry
that
i
did
take
a
tramp
into
the
house
to
rob
my
master
will
you
let
me
stay
said
queenie
once
more
looking
over
her
shoulder
as
she
was
wearily
descending
the
marble
steps
if
the
woman
heart
had
not
been
made
of
stone
it
must
have
melted
at
the
anguish
in
that
sweet
white
face
but
she
only
reiterated
her
refusal
more
angrily
i
am
friendless
and
penniless
pleaded
queenie
still
hoping
to
melt
that
icy
heart
think
what
may
happen
to
me
in
the
streets
at
night
go
go
exclaimed
the
creature
fiercely
i
will
go
said
queenie
drawing
her
cloak
about
her
and
preparing
to
breast
the
wintery
storm
i
will
go
but
remember
madam
that
you
may
one
day
repent
this
it
is
quite
quite
possible
that
i
may
one
day
turn
you
from
these
doors
as
you
have
turned
me
for
all
answer
the
woman
slammed
the
door
in
her
face
and
fiercely
locked
it
queenie
was
left
alone
standing
on
the
wet
pavement
in
the
wintery
night
locked
out
of
her
husband
house
like
a
thief
a
waif
and
a
stray
by
night
while
over
her
loomed
the
great
palace
that
a
few
months
ago
had
been
splendidly
refitted
and
furnished
in
velvets
tapestries
gildings
and
bronzes
for
her
pleasure
it
was
hers
her
husband
therefore
her
own
yet
she
turned
away
from
its
inhospitable
doors
homeless
friendless
penniless
worse
than
all
where
the
lamps
quiver
so
far
in
the
river
with
many
a
light
from
window
and
casement
from
garret
to
basement
she
stood
with
amazement
houseless
by
night
chapter
xxi
it
is
some
time
since
we
have
seen
lyle
and
her
elder
daughter
we
must
seek
them
now
in
one
of
the
stately
homes
of
england
they
are
the
guests
of
lady
valentine
at
her
elegant
residence
in
the
most
fashionable
quarter
of
london
nearly
four
years
have
elapsed
since
we
first
met
the
lyles
and
heard
the
spirited
discussion
over
little
queenie
first
ball
and
old
green
silk
dress
sydney
and
georgina
would
not
need
to
scrimp
little
queenie
share
of
finery
to
bedeck
themselves
now
were
she
living
georgina
husband
is
wealthy
and
indulgent
and
uncle
robert
the
beneficent
friend
of
their
earlier
days
has
charged
himself
with
sydney
support
ever
since
her
father
died
until
recently
when
she
has
married
a
wealthy
man
lyle
lives
with
georgina
and
still
enjoys
the
whirl
of
fashionable
life
as
much
as
ever
indeed
more
than
ever
for
now
there
is
no
vexing
question
relative
to
the
girls
finery
disturbing
her
placid
mind
it
is
a
chilly
morning
in
and
the
three
ladies
are
sitting
in
a
pleasant
georgina
grown
plump
and
indolent
idly
reclining
in
an
with
her
dimpled
white
hands
lazily
folded
over
her
silken
lap
lyle
perusing
a
morning
paper
and
sydney
gazing
restlessly
out
of
the
window
watching
perhaps
for
her
husband
the
honeymoon
is
not
a
month
old
yet
and
she
is
naturally
impatient
at
his
absence
into
this
quiet
scene
enters
lord
valentine
and
tosses
some
cards
into
his
wife
lap
tickets
for
la
reine
blanche
he
says
all
three
ladies
utter
a
cry
of
delight
at
last
exclaims
lyle
in
a
spasm
of
anticipation
yes
at
last
laughs
my
lord
valentine
the
great
american
actress
will
play
at
the
theater
and
we
shall
have
a
chance
to
see
if
she
is
really
as
great
an
as
madame
rumor
reports
here
is
a
paragraph
regarding
her
now
says
lyle
and
taking
up
the
paper
she
reads
aloud
the
beautiful
and
gifted
young
american
actress
madame
reine
de
lisle
will
make
her
before
a
london
audience
in
the
great
emotional
play
of
and
juliet
the
fame
of
this
wonderful
has
preceded
her
to
england
and
all
lovers
of
the
drama
are
on
the
for
the
first
appearance
of
la
reine
blanche
as
her
admirers
call
her
la
reine
blanche
said
lord
valentine
little
sister
looking
up
from
her
volume
of
history
as
she
sat
in
a
corner
by
the
fire
la
reine
blanche
that
means
white
queen
they
used
to
call
mary
queen
of
scots
la
reine
blanche
because
she
was
so
fair
and
lovely
and
because
she
wore
a
white
dress
when
she
was
in
mourning
i
have
just
been
reading
about
her
in
my
history
i
wonder
if
this
great
actress
is
beautiful
also
she
is
said
to
be
the
most
beautiful
blonde
in
the
world
alice
said
lord
valentine
smiling
down
at
the
little
a
slight
cloud
has
shadowed
the
brightness
of
lady
valentine
face
while
little
lady
alice
is
speaking
she
leans
toward
her
mother
and
says
in
a
slightly
lowered
voice
but
one
which
is
distinctly
audible
to
sydney
alice
french
recalls
my
own
mamma
have
you
ever
thought
what
the
name
of
this
great
tragedy
if
rendered
into
english
would
be
de
repeated
lyle
musingly
then
she
gives
a
great
start
it
would
be
ah
it
would
be
queen
lyle
exactly
says
georgina
quite
an
odd
coincidence
is
it
not
she
leans
back
in
her
seat
with
a
thoughtful
look
on
her
pretty
pink
and
white
face
old
times
and
old
interests
crowd
into
her
mind
with
the
memory
of
her
younger
sister
time
has
thrown
a
veil
over
queenie
faults
and
follies
and
georgina
recalls
her
now
with
a
softening
remembrance
and
half
regrets
the
scorn
she
cast
upon
her
when
she
returned
to
them
so
strangely
but
ah
that
missing
year
she
asks
herself
as
she
has
done
many
times
before
where
was
it
spent
sydney
had
risen
at
the
first
mention
of
queenie
name
and
swept
out
of
the
room
neither
time
nor
change
had
softened
her
hatred
and
resentment
against
poor
little
queenie
she
had
hated
her
beautiful
sister
while
living
and
she
hated
her
even
in
her
grave
so
bitterly
that
she
could
not
endure
the
mention
of
her
name
even
now
when
years
had
come
and
gone
chapter
xxii
let
us
go
home
mother
i
am
tired
already
the
play
is
sickening
i
always
thought
so
it
is
sydney
who
speaks
and
her
voice
is
full
of
restless
discontent
she
is
in
a
box
at
the
theater
looking
brilliantly
beautiful
in
black
velvet
and
diamonds
the
place
is
packed
from
pit
to
dome
but
in
the
dazzling
rows
of
fair
faces
there
is
not
one
handsomer
than
hers
even
now
when
it
is
marred
by
that
look
of
impatience
almost
anger
that
rests
upon
it
like
a
threatening
cloud
upon
a
summer
sky
lyle
a
passionate
lover
of
the
drama
turns
a
look
of
dismay
upon
her
handsome
daughter
oh
not
yet
she
said
quickly
i
would
not
miss
seeing
the
play
through
for
anything
you
have
seen
it
often
enough
before
objects
sydney
but
if
you
are
determined
to
stay
i
will
go
alone
if
lord
valentine
will
put
me
into
the
carriage
do
go
yet
says
lord
valentine
turning
his
eyes
a
moment
from
the
stage
to
glance
at
his
a
trifle
impatiently
at
least
wait
until
ernscliffe
comes
he
does
not
appear
to
be
coming
at
all
i
will
not
wait
for
him
sydney
answers
and
the
look
of
discontent
deepens
into
downright
vexation
at
that
moment
the
box
door
opens
and
a
gentleman
comes
up
behind
her
chair
georgina
turns
quickly
ah
captain
ernscliffe
you
are
just
in
time
she
says
here
is
sydney
trying
to
persuade
us
to
go
home
before
the
play
is
half
over
perhaps
you
can
induce
her
to
wait
sydney
looks
up
to
him
and
a
tender
smile
curves
her
crimson
lips
you
are
late
she
murmurs
i
was
detained
he
answers
carelessly
how
are
you
enjoying
the
performance
of
the
great
actress
her
lip
curls
scornfully
not
at
all
i
am
tired
of
the
whole
sickening
thing
will
you
take
me
home
is
the
balcony
scene
over
yet
he
asks
oh
no
lady
valentine
answers
only
the
first
act
do
you
really
want
to
go
sydney
he
asks
i
really
want
to
go
she
answers
rising
and
drawing
her
opera
cloak
about
her
white
shoulders
he
gives
her
his
arm
in
silence
and
leads
her
away
puts
her
into
the
carriage
and
they
are
whirled
rapidly
homeward
but
when
he
sees
her
safely
inside
lord
valentine
handsome
house
he
turns
to
go
back
you
will
not
leave
me
sydney
says
pleadingly
and
laying
her
white
jeweled
hand
on
his
black
coat
sleeve
i
wish
to
see
the
play
out
he
answers
with
a
touch
of
impatience
in
his
voice
i
assure
you
it
is
not
worth
seeing
the
acting
is
merely
mediocre
madame
de
lisle
has
been
greatly
she
urges
with
a
tone
of
anxiety
in
her
voice
as
she
looks
down
almost
afraid
that
he
will
detect
the
falsehood
she
is
telling
in
her
eager
face
you
make
me
more
curious
than
ever
he
answers
lightly
i
must
certainly
see
her
and
judge
for
myself
perhaps
the
wonderful
beauty
over
which
men
rave
so
much
has
blinded
the
judgment
of
the
critics
revoir
he
frees
himself
from
her
clasp
gently
but
firmly
and
runs
down
the
steps
sydney
stands
as
he
has
left
her
the
rich
cloak
falling
from
her
shoulders
her
hands
clasped
before
her
a
tearless
misery
looking
forth
from
her
dark
eyes
i
have
lied
to
him
and
gained
nothing
by
it
she
murmurs
in
a
passionate
undertone
he
will
go
back
there
he
will
see
that
terrible
resemblance
that
shocked
us
all
and
he
will
be
reminded
of
the
one
whom
i
wish
him
to
forget
oh
it
is
a
dreadful
coincidence
the
same
name
the
same
face
the
same
voice
if
we
had
lost
her
in
any
way
save
by
death
i
could
have
sworn
that
it
was
queenie
herself
that
i
saw
dancing
on
the
stage
at
ball
captain
ernscliffe
hastened
back
to
the
theater
anxious
to
be
in
time
for
the
second
act
which
is
a
favorite
with
all
admirers
of
romeo
and
juliet
lord
valentine
glances
around
as
he
enters
the
box
and
drops
into
a
chair
ah
ernscliffe
he
says
just
in
time
the
balcony
scene
is
on
ernscliffe
leans
forward
scanning
the
stage
eagerly
and
quite
unconscious
that
his
three
companions
in
the
box
are
regarding
him
with
curious
eyes
anxious
to
note
what
impression
the
great
actress
would
produce
upon
him
he
sees
the
sighing
walking
about
and
soliloquizing
in
the
garden
of
the
hostile
the
gentle
in
the
balcony
above
him
his
dark
eyes
rest
on
her
for
a
moment
then
he
gives
a
violent
start
heaven
he
mutters
under
his
breath
and
grows
pale
beneath
his
olive
skin
he
can
see
the
likeness
too
lady
valentine
whispered
to
her
mother
rapt
spellbound
like
one
in
a
bewildering
dream
captain
ernscliffe
bends
forward
the
deep
pallor
of
painful
emotion
on
his
dusk
handsome
face
his
dark
eyes
fixed
on
the
hapless
young
in
a
wild
astonished
incredulous
gaze
as
she
leans
upon
the
balcony
murmuring
words
of
love
to
handsome
young
in
the
garden
beneath
it
was
no
wonder
for
in
her
fair
young
beauty
her
misty
white
robe
looped
with
rosebuds
her
floating
curls
of
gold
is
the
exact
and
perfect
counterpart
of
queenie
lyle
when
he
first
met
her
at
grand
ball
not
a
tone
of
her
voice
not
a
curve
of
her
lip
not
the
fall
of
a
ringlet
differs
from
the
lovely
girl
who
had
won
his
heart
that
night
the
peerless
bride
that
death
had
torn
from
his
arms
in
the
very
moment
that
he
claimed
her
as
his
own
like
one
in
a
dream
he
listened
and
looked
he
heard
exclaim
in
deep
and
passionate
accents
by
yonder
blessed
moon
i
swear
that
tips
with
silver
all
these
tops
and
interrupted
in
those
tones
so
strangely
familiar
to
his
ear
swear
not
by
the
moon
th
inconstant
moon
that
monthly
changes
in
her
circled
orb
lest
that
thy
love
prove
likewise
variable
with
those
words
oh
swear
not
by
the
moon
th
inconstant
moon
raised
her
eyes
that
had
been
downcast
and
fixed
on
her
lover
and
looked
upward
as
if
to
gaze
upon
the
fair
orb
of
which
she
spoke
in
that
moment
her
eyes
shining
like
stars
of
the
night
encountered
the
fixed
and
passionate
gaze
of
the
handsome
man
in
the
box
above
her
she
started
it
was
not
his
dreaming
fancy
it
was
too
palpable
to
all
recovered
herself
with
an
effort
and
went
on
in
a
voice
that
trembled
in
spite
of
her
brave
endeavor
monthly
changes
in
her
circled
orb
lest
that
thy
love
prove
likewise
variable
great
god
it
is
queenie
herself
do
the
dead
come
back
from
the
grave
i
must
see
her
speak
to
her
exclaimed
captain
ernscliffe
in
a
passionate
undertone
as
he
sprang
up
and
turned
toward
the
box
door
lord
valentine
who
had
watched
him
attentively
caught
him
by
the
arm
ernscliffe
are
you
mad
we
all
see
the
resemblance
it
is
accidental
of
course
what
would
you
do
ernscliffe
shook
off
his
grasp
roughly
yes
i
am
mad
he
exclaimed
for
i
believe
that
the
dead
is
alive
and
that
yonder
is
my
lost
bride
queenie
lyle
he
opened
the
box
door
with
a
shaking
hand
and
rushed
wildly
out
la
reine
blanche
went
on
with
her
part
and
acted
more
brilliantly
than
ever
she
surpassed
herself
she
seemed
under
the
influence
of
some
strong
excitement
that
lent
new
power
and
force
to
her
superb
rendition
of
the
vast
and
brilliant
audience
was
fairly
carried
away
at
the
close
of
the
second
act
flowers
fairly
rained
upon
her
she
was
called
back
before
the
curtain
and
the
thunders
of
applause
shook
the
building
then
the
manager
came
to
her
with
a
little
bit
of
pasteboard
in
his
hand
madame
de
lisle
he
said
there
is
a
gentleman
outside
who
is
so
opportune
in
his
desire
to
see
you
that
i
was
forced
to
bring
you
his
card
although
i
know
you
always
refuse
to
make
men
acquaintances
she
took
the
card
and
read
the
name
lawrence
ernscliffe
will
you
see
him
asked
the
manager
seeing
that
she
stood
silent
as
if
hesitating
no
no
she
answered
tell
him
he
must
excuse
me
i
have
to
dress
for
my
part
in
the
third
act
the
manager
turned
away
and
the
beautiful
actress
pressed
her
lips
passionately
upon
the
insensible
little
bit
of
pasteboard
she
held
in
her
white
and
jeweled
hand
at
last
at
last
she
murmured
yet
i
must
not
meet
him
i
could
not
go
on
with
my
part
it
would
unfit
me
for
anything
i
must
postpone
my
happiness
yet
a
little
longer
ah
she
walked
up
and
down
pressing
her
hands
on
her
wildly
beating
heart
as
if
to
still
its
convulsive
throbs
they
say
that
happiness
never
kills
she
said
if
it
were
otherwise
i
should
feel
afraid
my
heart
aches
with
joy
it
seems
as
if
it
would
burst
it
is
so
full
of
happy
emotion
she
went
back
on
the
stage
and
a
timid
glance
showed
her
lawrence
ernscliffe
back
in
the
box
looking
terribly
restless
and
disappointed
she
was
afraid
to
meet
his
eyes
again
but
she
knew
that
he
watched
her
through
every
scene
devouring
every
movement
with
passionate
yearning
eyes
at
the
close
of
the
act
she
saw
a
lovely
bouquet
thrown
from
his
hand
and
picking
it
up
she
discovered
a
tiny
note
among
the
flowers
when
the
curtain
fell
she
read
the
hastily
penciled
lines
madame
de
lisle
for
god
sake
let
me
see
you
if
only
for
a
moment
i
speak
to
you
i
shall
go
mad
if
you
do
take
pity
on
my
anxiety
and
grant
an
interview
to
lawrence
ernscliffe
tears
came
into
the
eyes
of
the
beautiful
actress
as
she
read
those
lines
but
when
after
another
act
the
same
card
was
handed
her
she
again
refused
to
see
the
writer
on
pretence
of
dressing
for
her
next
appearance
she
murmured
to
herself
i
will
see
him
i
can
not
i
am
utterly
exhausted
i
have
rest
when
the
play
was
over
she
came
out
on
the
arm
of
the
manager
her
maid
on
the
other
side
of
her
as
she
stepped
into
her
carriage
she
saw
a
dark
handsome
face
regarding
her
earnestly
and
a
little
reproachfully
the
closing
door
sent
it
from
sight
and
she
was
whirled
away
to
her
hotel
she
did
not
know
that
captain
ernscliffe
had
sprung
into
a
cab
and
followed
her
neither
did
captain
ernscliffe
know
that
a
lady
heavily
cloaked
and
veiled
had
gotten
into
another
cab
and
followed
him
it
was
sydney
driven
to
desperation
by
her
jealous
misery
she
had
returned
to
the
theater
and
been
a
witness
to
captain
ernscliffe
agitated
recognition
of
the
actress
and
his
subsequent
persistent
attempt
to
secure
an
interview
with
her
heedless
of
everything
and
rendered
reckless
by
her
indefinable
dread
of
some
impending
evil
she
determined
to
follow
him
and
prevent
if
possible
an
interview
between
him
and
the
brilliant
actress
who
so
strikingly
resembled
his
lost
and
lamented
bride
it
was
midnight
when
the
three
vehicles
drew
up
before
the
grand
entrance
of
the
hotel
where
la
reine
blanche
had
her
elegant
suite
of
apartments
she
was
crossing
the
pavement
on
the
arm
of
her
elderly
duenna
when
a
light
touch
arrested
her
footsteps
she
turned
and
looked
into
the
face
of
captain
ernscliffe
it
was
white
wild
eager
one
word
if
you
please
madame
de
lisle
he
exclaimed
in
an
eager
agitated
voice
she
paused
a
moment
and
clung
tremblingly
to
the
arm
of
her
attendant
that
is
impossible
sir
she
answered
in
a
low
constrained
voice
call
on
me
at
noon
i
will
hear
you
then
without
another
word
she
turned
and
fled
up
the
steps
he
stood
looking
at
her
blankly
a
moment
then
his
cab
and
was
driven
away
he
did
not
notice
the
figure
of
a
woman
that
had
stood
almost
at
his
elbow
and
that
now
ran
lightly
up
the
hotel
steps
into
the
wide
lighted
hall
chapter
xxiii
la
reine
blanche
went
directly
to
her
where
her
maid
divested
her
of
her
heavy
wrappings
and
costume
and
substituted
a
of
white
turkish
silk
confined
at
the
waist
by
gold
cord
and
tassels
then
she
took
down
the
burnished
golden
hair
and
prepared
to
brush
and
plait
it
for
the
night
as
she
took
up
the
brush
there
came
a
timid
hesitating
rap
at
the
outer
door
madame
de
lisle
started
and
trembled
admit
no
one
elsie
she
said
nervously
as
the
maid
turned
toward
the
door
elsie
came
back
in
a
minute
with
a
penciled
slip
of
paper
her
mistress
took
it
and
read
these
words
will
madame
de
lisle
accord
the
favor
of
a
brief
interview
to
a
lady
who
calls
on
important
business
a
lady
at
this
time
of
the
night
said
la
reine
blanche
lifting
her
arched
brows
very
slightly
yes
madam
a
real
lady
at
least
she
spoke
and
moved
like
one
replied
elsie
respectfully
tell
her
i
can
see
no
one
i
am
too
weary
she
must
call
another
time
said
the
actress
in
an
agitated
voice
elsie
turned
away
with
the
message
but
before
she
reached
the
door
she
was
confronted
by
the
lady
who
had
heard
the
refusal
and
entered
in
spite
of
it
she
advanced
into
the
room
and
stood
before
the
actress
who
had
risen
from
her
seat
and
leaned
against
a
chair
her
golden
hair
falling
about
her
like
a
misty
veil
madame
de
lisle
said
the
intruder
in
a
slightly
tremulous
voice
i
entreat
you
to
pardon
this
untimely
intrusion
will
you
send
your
maid
away
that
i
may
plead
my
justifiable
excuse
la
reine
blanche
motioned
to
the
maid
to
withdraw
into
an
inner
room
at
the
pleasure
of
her
visitor
then
she
looked
wistfully
at
the
lady
who
had
thrown
off
her
concealing
hood
and
cloak
and
stood
revealed
in
all
her
majestic
beauty
clothed
splendidly
in
black
velvet
and
sparkling
diamonds
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
here
said
sydney
interrogatively
the
actress
bowed
silently
she
seemed
like
one
stricken
dumb
and
incapable
of
speech
you
were
annoyed
this
evening
by
the
persistent
attempts
of
a
gentleman
to
obtain
speech
with
you
went
on
sydney
again
madame
de
lisle
bowed
silently
she
seemed
like
one
dazed
and
stood
regarding
her
visitor
without
remembering
that
courtesy
required
her
to
offer
her
a
seat
it
is
of
that
i
wish
to
speak
madam
i
heard
you
tell
him
he
might
call
on
you
at
noon
i
beg
you
madame
de
lisle
to
recall
that
permission
and
to
utterly
decline
the
acquaintance
of
lawrence
ernscliffe
now
and
forever
the
failing
senses
of
la
reine
blanche
seemed
to
return
to
her
with
a
gasp
she
straightened
her
drooping
figure
and
looked
haughtily
at
the
speaker
may
i
inquire
why
you
proffer
such
a
singular
request
she
asked
coldly
is
it
necessary
that
i
should
explain
my
motive
for
the
request
if
i
do
so
it
will
be
at
the
expense
of
some
humiliation
to
myself
said
the
visitor
and
a
faint
flush
colored
her
handsome
face
for
a
moment
they
stood
regarding
each
other
fixedly
the
handsome
brunette
in
her
velvet
and
diamonds
the
blonde
in
her
sweeping
robe
and
veil
of
golden
hair
looking
like
a
white
queen
indeed
then
the
actress
said
in
a
voice
full
of
veiled
passion
and
almost
defiance
it
would
take
a
strong
motive
indeed
to
cause
me
to
decline
the
acquaintance
of
lawrence
ernscliffe
let
me
know
your
reason
that
i
may
judge
if
it
be
potent
enough
to
secure
your
wish
with
a
swift
rush
forward
sydney
fell
on
her
knees
before
the
beautiful
woman
madame
de
lisle
she
said
pleadingly
i
humble
myself
before
you
to
beg
for
my
happiness
i
love
lawrence
ernscliffe
i
hoped
i
was
winning
his
love
in
return
until
he
saw
you
on
the
stage
your
beauty
your
splendid
acting
above
all
your
striking
resemblance
to
one
he
has
loved
and
lost
took
his
heart
by
storm
he
is
carried
away
by
this
mad
and
wicked
infatuation
nothing
but
a
studied
coldness
from
you
can
check
this
mad
passion
will
you
now
that
i
have
told
you
all
do
as
i
have
begged
you
something
pathetic
in
the
woman
humility
touched
a
pitying
chord
in
the
heart
of
la
reine
blanche
she
took
her
gently
by
the
hand
and
placed
her
in
a
chair
you
say
that
i
resemble
one
whom
he
has
loved
and
lost
she
said
who
was
she
she
was
his
bride
answered
sydney
his
bride
and
my
sister
she
died
at
the
altar
but
i
had
the
better
claim
upon
him
he
admired
me
and
i
believe
he
would
have
loved
and
married
me
if
he
had
not
inopportunely
met
her
but
as
i
have
told
you
she
died
now
after
years
i
had
almost
won
his
love
again
when
you
came
here
with
face
and
won
him
from
me
it
is
almost
as
if
the
dead
had
come
back
la
reine
blanche
looked
at
her
with
a
strange
smile
i
have
heard
it
said
she
remarked
that
if
the
dead
could
come
back
after
a
few
years
they
would
find
their
places
filled
their
names
forgotten
and
themselves
unwelcome
sydney
gave
her
a
keen
glance
madam
that
is
true
she
said
if
my
sister
could
come
back
to
us
we
could
not
help
being
sorry
she
was
a
trouble
and
disgrace
to
us
while
living
and
we
can
not
help
feeling
relieved
that
the
grass
is
growing
over
all
her
faults
and
follies
you
did
not
love
your
sister
said
the
actress
with
her
blue
eyes
blazing
like
stars
sydney
looked
at
her
with
a
flash
of
hatred
in
her
dusky
orbs
madam
she
said
could
you
love
the
thing
that
stood
between
you
and
your
happiness
they
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
in
silence
and
the
flashing
eyes
of
the
beautiful
actress
seemed
to
burn
into
sydney
heart
a
sudden
horrible
fear
darted
into
her
mind
the
dead
come
back
she
asked
herself
oh
no
it
be
you
will
not
answer
me
she
said
wildly
oh
madame
de
lisle
be
generous
you
have
lovers
by
the
score
they
tell
me
you
have
refused
to
marry
a
duke
one
heart
more
or
less
can
not
matter
to
you
you
must
not
take
my
lawrence
from
me
he
is
my
all
your
exclaimed
la
reine
blanche
with
a
curling
lip
lady
you
prate
of
your
love
for
lawrence
ernscliffe
you
tell
me
that
he
is
your
you
tell
me
what
he
is
to
will
you
tell
me
what
you
are
to
there
was
a
tone
of
triumph
in
her
sweet
incisive
voice
as
she
confronted
her
visitor
madam
said
sydney
proudly
and
haughtily
is
my
husband
i
am
his
wife
his
wife
oh
my
god
it
was
the
cry
of
a
breaking
heart
that
cleft
the
midnight
air
the
actress
staggered
backward
tried
to
catch
at
a
chair
to
save
herself
from
falling
and
then
dropped
heavily
to
the
floor
and
laid
there
without
a
sign
of
life
elsie
came
rushing
in
from
the
next
room
frightened
at
the
sound
oh
my
poor
mistress
you
have
killed
her
she
cried
it
is
nothing
but
a
swoon
she
will
soon
revive
was
the
contemptuous
answer
but
in
her
heart
sydney
prayed
oh
that
it
might
be
death
but
the
impious
prayer
was
not
answered
thus
elsie
energetic
efforts
soon
restored
her
mistress
to
consciousness
and
lying
languidly
on
a
silken
divan
she
turned
her
beautiful
eyes
back
to
sydney
face
you
may
retire
again
sydney
said
to
the
maid
we
have
much
still
to
say
to
each
other
the
maid
was
about
to
refuse
but
an
imperative
command
from
her
mistress
caused
her
to
retire
at
once
then
the
two
beautiful
women
looked
at
each
other
with
ominous
glances
so
you
queenie
herself
i
thought
as
much
exclaimed
sydney
in
a
hissing
tone
of
hate
yes
i
am
queenie
answered
the
actress
coolly
i
have
come
back
from
the
grave
sydney
but
it
seems
that
i
have
neither
name
nor
place
in
the
hearts
that
once
were
mine
no
and
shall
have
exclaimed
sydney
passionately
to
herself
but
aloud
she
said
in
a
voice
that
she
strove
to
render
calm
and
controlled
will
you
tell
me
why
you
are
here
i
am
here
to
claim
my
husband
answered
queenie
promptly
and
firmly
if
a
look
could
have
killed
queenie
ernscliffe
would
have
been
stricken
dead
at
her
sister
feet
you
will
have
to
prove
a
few
things
before
you
accomplish
your
purpose
she
retorted
i
can
prove
all
that
is
necessary
was
the
calm
reply
can
you
justify
yourself
in
the
matter
of
that
shameful
hidden
year
in
your
life
of
which
i
shall
surely
inform
captain
ernscliffe
asked
sydney
malevolently
sydney
forbear
exclaimed
the
actress
lifting
her
hand
as
if
to
ward
off
some
cruel
blow
i
have
borne
all
that
i
can
bear
you
must
leave
me
now
come
and
lunch
with
me
and
you
shall
hear
the
story
of
that
missing
year
you
shall
judge
whether
i
can
justify
myself
in
the
eyes
of
my
husband
will
you
promise
not
to
see
him
until
after
that
asked
sydney
anxiously
as
she
turned
to
go
yes
i
will
promise
answered
queenie
chapter
xxiv
sydney
could
not
wait
until
the
hour
for
luncheon
next
day
she
was
terribly
afraid
that
captain
ernscliffe
might
by
some
means
secure
a
meeting
with
la
reine
blanche
and
that
the
fatal
truth
might
be
revealed
to
the
utter
destruction
of
the
frail
superstructure
of
her
own
happiness
he
had
not
been
back
to
the
house
since
he
had
left
her
to
return
to
the
theater
the
night
before
and
the
most
dreadful
fancies
continually
darted
through
her
mind
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
wait
until
the
hour
her
sister
had
specified
as
early
as
ten
she
entered
the
hotel
and
was
shown
into
the
parlor
of
the
great
actress
queenie
was
at
home
she
had
just
returned
from
an
early
rehearsal
at
the
theater
and
lay
resting
on
a
low
divan
of
cushioned
blue
satin
she
wore
a
trained
dress
of
black
velvet
and
satin
with
laces
at
the
wrists
and
a
fichu
of
the
rarest
old
lace
fastened
at
her
throat
by
a
brooch
of
dead
gold
a
single
cluster
of
white
hyacinth
was
fastened
in
with
the
lace
and
filled
the
room
with
its
subtle
delicious
fragrance
her
abundant
golden
hair
was
braided
into
a
coronet
and
confined
with
a
comb
of
pearl
in
spite
of
an
almost
marble
pallor
and
a
look
of
terrible
suffering
she
appeared
as
lovely
as
sydney
had
ever
seen
her
at
the
entrance
of
her
rival
she
lifted
her
head
and
with
a
faint
sigh
motioned
her
to
a
seat
near
her
you
come
early
she
said
i
could
not
wait
sydney
answered
i
was
too
impatient
you
have
not
spoken
with
with
husband
said
the
actress
filling
up
the
embarrassed
pause
with
a
faint
and
mirthless
laugh
no
sydney
i
have
not
spoken
with
him
i
saw
him
on
the
pavement
this
morning
when
i
left
the
theater
but
i
drew
down
my
veil
and
looked
another
way
the
look
of
dread
in
sydney
dark
eyes
softened
into
relief
oh
queenie
she
exclaimed
if
you
only
go
away
from
here
without
speaking
to
him
think
of
the
consequences
that
would
follow
such
a
revelation
the
nine
days
wonder
over
you
the
shame
the
despair
the
utter
desolation
for
me
oh
queenie
if
you
would
but
go
away
with
your
secret
untold
and
leave
my
husband
queenie
red
lips
curled
scornfully
ah
sydney
she
said
you
were
always
selfish
you
think
only
of
yourself
you
would
sacrifice
my
happiness
to
your
own
happiness
queenie
ah
what
happiness
could
it
give
you
to
be
to
lawrence
ernscliffe
you
never
professed
to
love
him
a
crimson
blush
rose
into
queenie
cheek
she
put
up
her
small
hand
to
hide
it
but
when
it
fell
to
her
side
again
the
warm
color
had
not
faded
it
seemed
but
to
burn
the
brighter
as
she
said
in
a
low
and
earnest
voice
no
sydney
i
never
professed
to
love
him
i
do
not
think
i
loved
him
when
i
promised
to
marry
him
and
yet
in
the
few
weeks
that
intervened
before
he
led
me
to
the
altar
i
learned
to
love
him
with
as
deep
and
fond
a
love
as
the
most
exacting
heart
could
have
asked
for
time
silence
and
suffering
have
but
deepened
and
intensified
that
passion
until
it
has
become
like
the
very
pulse
of
my
heart
he
is
the
one
dear
thing
to
me
yet
you
ask
me
to
give
him
to
you
you
have
your
art
your
profession
surely
you
love
that
said
sydney
anxiously
it
has
been
but
the
means
to
an
end
replied
queenie
it
has
never
filled
but
half
my
heart
the
other
half
has
never
been
at
rest
it
has
always
been
seeking
its
lost
mate
how
could
i
give
him
up
now
that
i
have
found
him
you
mean
to
take
him
from
me
then
said
sydney
with
a
dangerous
gleam
of
hatred
firing
into
her
black
eyes
la
reine
blanche
did
not
answer
the
blush
had
faded
from
her
cheeks
and
left
them
deathly
pale
sydney
could
read
nothing
of
her
thoughts
in
the
blue
eyes
half
veiled
by
the
sweeping
lashes
she
moved
restlessly
in
her
chair
you
promised
to
tell
me
your
story
she
said
coldly
and
sharply
i
am
here
to
listen
the
faded
color
rushed
back
in
crimson
waves
to
queenie
face
she
looked
up
into
the
proud
scornful
features
of
her
sister
i
am
going
to
keep
my
word
she
said
and
yet
sydney
will
you
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
would
rather
tell
my
story
to
any
other
person
on
earth
than
you
yes
i
think
i
could
sooner
tell
lawrence
ernscliffe
himself
i
do
not
believe
that
anyone
else
would
judge
me
as
harshly
and
unpityingly
as
you
will
do
not
even
a
stranger
she
was
silent
a
moment
and
lay
still
shading
her
face
with
one
small
white
hand
that
sparkled
with
diamonds
then
as
sydney
made
no
answer
she
said
with
a
visible
effort
where
shall
i
begin
sydney
at
the
beginning
answered
sydney
curtly
i
must
go
back
four
years
then
said
queenie
sydney
do
you
remember
the
day
that
i
sold
my
painted
fan
that
uncle
robert
gave
me
to
buy
a
tarleton
dress
to
wear
to
kirk
grand
ball
yes
i
remember
was
the
beginning
sydney
i
saw
a
gentleman
in
the
store
where
i
sold
my
fan
the
handsomest
man
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
tall
dark
elegant
he
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
as
i
left
the
store
and
my
foolish
heart
fluttered
into
my
mouth
you
know
i
was
very
young
and
romantic
at
that
time
both
things
of
which
i
can
not
accuse
myself
now
added
queenie
thinking
sagely
that
her
present
years
made
her
quite
elderly
yes
said
sydney
curtly
the
man
bought
my
fan
as
soon
as
i
left
the
store
then
he
followed
me
i
did
not
know
these
things
then
but
i
learned
them
afterward
perhaps
you
remember
that
unknown
admirer
sent
the
fan
back
to
me
yes
said
sydney
curtly
you
remember
also
sydney
that
every
day
an
elegant
bouquet
formed
of
the
choicest
flowers
came
to
me
from
the
same
unknown
source
sydney
nodded
an
affirmative
answer
i
was
very
young
and
foolish
in
those
days
said
queenie
with
a
sigh
i
do
not
suppose
that
any
girl
ever
lived
more
silly
and
romantic
than
i
was
i
brooded
day
and
night
over
the
mysterious
donor
of
the
fan
and
flowers
all
my
secret
thoughts
were
of
him
i
felt
quite
sure
in
my
own
mind
that
the
handsome
man
who
had
looked
at
me
so
admiringly
in
the
fancy
store
was
my
unknown
admirer
i
expected
daily
to
meet
him
somewhere
in
the
haunts
of
the
gay
society
in
which
i
had
become
somewhat
of
a
belle
you
remember
sydney
sydney
did
not
answer
and
she
went
on
slowly
i
did
not
meet
him
in
society
but
after
a
time
we
met
in
a
public
park
i
was
walking
there
alone
i
slipped
and
fell
spraining
my
ankle
severely
a
gentleman
rushed
to
my
assistance
it
was
the
handsome
stranger
of
whom
i
had
dreamed
so
much
that
i
had
become
perfectly
infatuated
with
him
he
placed
me
in
a
carriage
and
took
me
home
you
were
all
out
that
day
and
i
never
told
of
that
event
in
my
life
through
some
undefined
fear
of
censure
that
was
where
my
fault
began
in
that
first
act
of
secrecy
she
paused
a
moment
and
a
sigh
drifted
over
her
pale
and
quivering
lips
sydney
sat
perfectly
still
regarding
her
with
stern
unpitying
eyes
as
though
they
were
strangers
instead
of
sisters
whom
the
same
mother
had
nursed
on
her
breast
we
met
again
and
again
said
queenie
slowly
always
by
accident
it
seemed
at
first
sydney
and
i
am
quite
sure
it
accident
on
my
part
but
i
know
now
that
it
was
by
design
on
the
part
of
vinton
he
wooed
me
in
the
most
romantic
fashion
flowers
and
poetry
were
the
vehicles
through
which
he
conveyed
his
sentiments
until
at
last
grown
bolder
he
openly
avowed
his
love
for
me
you
must
have
been
very
forward
to
have
encouraged
him
to
a
declaration
so
soon
said
sydney
with
a
sneer
sydney
i
declare
to
you
i
was
not
oh
if
you
knew
leon
vinton
as
i
do
now
you
would
know
that
i
was
not
you
would
know
that
the
more
timid
and
shrinking
the
dove
the
more
fierce
and
unrelenting
would
be
his
pursuit
exclaimed
queenie
with
a
scarlet
blush
at
her
sister
cruel
charge
i
knew
of
course
she
continued
after
a
moment
thoughtful
pause
home
was
the
proper
place
for
my
lover
to
woo
me
i
said
as
much
to
him
his
ready
excuse
appeared
perfectly
sufficient
in
my
silly
eyes
he
told
me
that
he
was
a
foreigner
of
high
birth
and
rank
exiled
from
his
native
land
through
a
political
offense
and
that
he
had
heard
that
my
father
was
bitterly
opposed
to
all
foreigners
he
therefore
felt
it
to
be
quite
hopeless
to
seek
for
the
to
my
father
house
little
simpleton
that
i
was
i
swallowed
the
whole
stupendous
lie
because
it
was
baited
with
the
one
single
grain
of
truth
namely
the
fact
that
my
father
was
bitterly
prejudiced
against
all
persons
of
foreign
birth
i
believed
all
he
told
me
and
worse
than
all
i
believed
that
i
was
deeply
and
devotedly
in
love
with
him
that
was
the
blind
mistake
of
my
life
sydney
i
know
that
i
was
not
in
love
with
the
it
was
the
romance
and
poetry
of
his
manner
of
wooing
me
the
mystery
that
surrounded
him
with
an
atmosphere
of
ideality
that
fascinated
and
infatuated
me
i
was
very
young
and
romantic
as
he
well
knew
when
he
set
his
artful
trap
for
me
he
knew
too
well
how
to
bait
it
it
was
only
the
wooing
that
i
loved
when
i
thought
it
was
the
wooer
her
voice
broke
a
moment
and
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
sydney
offered
no
comment
but
sat
as
still
and
silent
as
a
statue
regarding
her
intently
yet
why
do
i
linger
over
those
fatal
hours
resumed
queenie
with
a
heavy
sigh
they
can
have
but
little
interest
for
you
i
will
briefly
relate
what
came
after
you
remember
sydney
how
i
left
you
all
the
day
we
started
to
europe
on
the
pretense
of
returning
to
remain
with
papa
yes
sydney
answered
in
a
tone
of
scorn
it
was
a
preconcerted
plan
said
the
actress
dropping
her
eyes
in
shame
and
remorse
in
less
than
an
hour
after
i
left
you
sydney
i
met
leon
vinton
and
was
married
to
him
married
to
him
exclaimed
sydney
incredulously
the
blue
eyes
and
the
black
ones
met
for
a
moment
one
pair
cold
and
incredulous
the
others
full
of
raging
scorn
sydney
you
are
cruel
exclaimed
queenie
indignantly
how
else
should
i
have
gone
away
with
him
i
was
as
pure
and
innocent
as
a
little
child
there
was
not
a
thought
of
evil
in
my
heart
i
would
have
died
the
most
horrible
death
that
could
be
conceived
of
before
i
would
have
willfully
sinned
why
then
did
you
not
confess
the
truth
when
you
came
home
asked
sydney
if
you
were
married
where
was
your
husband
why
did
you
suffer
us
to
think
worse
things
of
you
wait
until
i
have
finished
my
story
sydney
then
you
will
understand
why
answered
queenie
mournfully
we
were
married
as
i
told
you
she
continued
we
went
to
live
in
a
beautiful
cottage
on
the
banks
of
the
river
about
five
miles
from
the
city
where
we
lived
my
husband
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
wealth
and
taste
my
home
was
splendidly
furnished
i
had
servants
to
wait
upon
me
the
best
of
everything
to
eat
and
wear
he
appeared
to
be
perfectly
devoted
to
me
i
had
but
two
things
to
complain
of
one
was
the
utter
seclusion
in
which
we
lived
he
went
into
no
society
and
we
saw
no
company
not
a
single
person
ever
visited
us
i
rode
out
in
a
carriage
with
vinton
sometimes
once
we
went
to
the
theater
near
my
old
home
and
an
irresistible
desire
seized
upon
me
to
look
upon
the
face
of
my
father
once
more
vinton
had
always
sternly
forbidden
me
to
venture
near
my
home
but
i
eluded
him
somehow
in
the
crush
coming
out
of
the
theater
and
ran
homeward
with
flying
footsteps
i
looked
into
the
window
sydney
it
was
late
but
i
saw
papa
he
was
sitting
sad
and
alone
thinking
perhaps
of
his
absent
dear
ones
he
looked
so
old
and
broken
it
almost
broke
my
heart
chapter
xxv
queenie
paused
a
moment
and
sydney
saw
that
warm
passionate
tears
were
streaming
down
her
cheeks
the
sight
awoke
no
pity
in
the
heart
of
the
elder
sister
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
hatred
was
simply
measureless
for
the
beautiful
young
sister
who
living
or
dead
held
lawrence
ernscliffe
heart
papa
looked
up
and
saw
me
continued
queenie
brushing
away
the
crystal
drops
with
her
perfumed
handkerchief
he
took
me
for
a
ghost
i
think
i
ran
away
and
met
vinton
coming
after
me
he
was
very
angry
with
me
and
i
promised
him
i
would
not
venture
near
the
place
again
poor
papa
as
i
went
away
i
heard
him
wandering
in
the
garden
calling
my
name
i
longed
to
turn
back
and
throw
my
arms
about
his
neck
i
often
begged
vinton
to
allow
me
to
make
known
our
marriage
to
papa
and
trust
to
his
kind
heart
to
forgive
us
but
he
always
refused
angrily
he
had
a
terrible
temper
a
sleeping
devil
coiled
within
his
heart
you
said
that
you
had
but
two
things
to
complain
of
suggested
sydney
you
have
named
but
one
the
other
was
vinton
frequent
absence
from
me
he
spent
more
than
half
his
time
in
the
city
and
i
passed
more
than
half
my
time
alone
save
for
the
company
of
his
housekeeper
a
wicked
woman
whom
i
cordially
detested
when
i
complained
of
his
long
absence
he
represented
that
business
detained
him
from
my
side
but
when
i
ventured
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
his
business
he
almost
rudely
informed
me
that
it
was
no
part
of
my
province
to
inquire
into
his
affairs
i
asked
him
no
more
questions
and
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
what
engaged
his
time
and
attention
nor
what
was
the
source
of
his
apparent
wealth
we
had
been
married
almost
a
year
she
continued
after
a
slight
pause
when
i
began
to
notice
that
vinton
grew
cold
and
careless
to
me
and
his
mysterious
absences
became
longer
and
more
frequent
in
my
loneliness
and
isolation
i
began
to
pine
more
and
more
for
papa
whose
sad
and
troubled
face
as
i
saw
it
last
when
i
looked
into
the
window
that
night
haunted
me
persistently
to
my
surprise
vinton
ceased
to
chide
me
for
indulging
in
my
grief
and
pretended
to
be
willing
to
reveal
our
marriage
to
papa
and
beg
his
forgiveness
in
my
joy
at
this
assurance
i
threw
my
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
as
fondly
as
i
had
ever
done
in
the
first
days
of
our
union
that
evening
he
ordered
out
the
phaeton
to
take
me
home
to
papa
you
know
how
fond
i
was
of
papa
sydney
you
can
imagine
my
happiness
sydney
only
bowed
coldly
in
reply
am
going
to
take
you
home
by
a
new
route
vinton
said
to
me
turning
the
phaeton
into
a
lonely
unfrequented
road
in
my
joy
at
going
back
to
papa
i
consented
without
a
thought
of
the
oddity
of
the
words
i
only
said
to
him
not
make
it
a
longer
route
dear
leon
i
am
so
impatient
to
see
papa
again
she
was
growing
more
excited
now
she
rose
from
her
reclining
position
and
sitting
upright
looked
at
sydney
with
scarlet
cheeks
and
burning
violet
eyes
she
was
dazzlingly
beautiful
in
this
new
phase
her
fair
expressive
face
and
graceful
white
throat
rose
from
the
rich
and
somber
setting
of
black
velvet
like
some
rare
flower
her
voice
sounded
like
a
wail
of
the
saddest
music
it
was
the
cruelest
lie
a
man
ever
told
a
woman
sydney
she
went
on
clasping
and
unclasping
her
white
hands
together
in
passionate
excitement
we
never
went
near
home
he
never
intended
it
it
began
to
rain
soon
and
we
had
no
cover
to
the
phaeton
we
were
passing
through
a
thick
wood
and
he
forced
me
to
get
out
and
stand
under
the
trees
under
pretense
of
seeking
shelter
then
oh
sydney
sydney
with
the
chilly
rain
beating
down
upon
us
and
our
feet
half
buried
in
the
thick
drifts
of
autumn
leaves
he
told
me
oh
sydney
can
you
guess
what
horrible
thing
that
villain
told
me
the
tears
were
falling
down
her
cheeks
like
rain
as
she
looked
at
her
sister
but
she
conjecturing
the
truth
at
once
answered
promptly
and
coldly
he
told
you
that
he
had
deceived
you
that
you
were
not
his
wife
yes
sydney
that
was
what
he
told
me
answered
queenie
with
burning
cheeks
he
said
that
the
minister
who
united
us
was
no
more
a
minister
than
he
was
and
had
only
done
it
for
a
lark
he
said
he
was
tired
of
me
and
did
not
intend
to
charge
himself
with
my
support
any
longer
and
that
i
might
return
to
my
father
she
stopped
a
moment
and
brushed
away
the
tears
that
were
coursing
down
her
cheeks
oh
how
can
i
go
on
she
exclaimed
i
am
impatient
remarked
sydney
i
was
fairly
maddened
by
that
cruel
revelation
continued
queenie
oh
sydney
may
the
dear
lord
spare
you
from
such
suffering
as
was
mine
in
that
terrible
hour
i
went
mad
all
the
softness
of
womanhood
died
out
of
me
in
the
face
of
that
cruel
wrong
the
instinct
of
the
tigress
sprang
into
my
heart
i
thirsted
for
leon
vinton
blood
i
cursed
him
i
rushed
upon
him
and
fastened
my
little
white
fingers
in
his
throat
and
tried
to
kill
the
wretch
who
had
betrayed
me
a
murderess
exclaimed
sydney
recoiling
my
hands
were
all
too
weak
and
frail
to
wreak
justice
upon
the
villain
queenie
went
on
heedless
of
her
sister
ejaculation
he
pushed
me
off
he
swore
at
me
he
strangled
me
with
his
strong
white
fingers
threw
me
down
upon
the
earth
and
spurned
me
with
his
foot
aye
trampled
upon
me
you
saw
the
purple
print
of
his
on
my
brow
sydney
it
is
here
yet
she
said
pushing
back
the
fluffy
waves
of
golden
hair
from
her
brow
and
showing
the
livid
scar
after
that
i
remember
nothing
more
for
several
hours
she
went
on
seeing
that
sydney
made
no
answer
and
he
must
have
thought
that
he
had
killed
me
for
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
lying
in
a
grave
a
very
shallow
grave
i
was
covered
with
fresh
earth
and
dead
leaves
which
the
hard
and
steady
rain
had
partly
beaten
aside
leaving
my
face
exposed
my
murderer
had
not
buried
me
deep
enough
i
sprang
up
out
of
the
shallow
hole
in
which
he
had
laid
me
my
heart
beating
wildly
with
hatred
and
the
thirst
for
revenge
all
the
hours
of
unconsciousness
all
the
rain
and
cold
that
had
chilled
my
body
had
not
cooled
the
fire
of
hate
the
murderous
instinct
that
possessed
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
nothing
could
wipe
out
my
wrongs
except
leon
vinton
blood
and
this
is
the
innocent
little
child
that
used
to
be
my
father
pet
exclaimed
the
listener
with
a
shudder
yes
said
queenie
mournfully
it
seems
strange
does
it
not
i
who
only
four
years
ago
was
the
petted
child
of
my
father
heart
now
i
am
dead
to
all
that
once
knew
and
loved
me
i
have
gone
wrong
i
have
wandered
into
strange
paths
i
have
buried
peace
and
joy
i
have
broken
my
father
heart
all
for
the
sin
of
one
man
did
i
say
nay
rather
a
devil
in
the
guise
of
an
angel
of
light
chapter
xxvi
if
sydney
heart
had
been
less
hard
than
marble
she
must
have
pitied
the
beautiful
unfortunate
young
sister
so
sadly
rehearsing
the
story
of
her
terrible
wrongs
but
she
uttered
no
word
of
sympathy
or
pity
she
did
not
take
the
golden
head
upon
her
breast
and
weep
over
it
as
a
loving
sister
would
have
done
she
only
said
in
her
cold
hard
jealous
voice
go
on
queenie
you
went
home
to
papa
then
no
i
did
not
i
went
back
to
the
beautiful
cottage
where
i
had
lived
in
a
fool
paradise
one
fatal
year
before
i
reached
there
i
saw
standing
alone
on
the
banks
of
the
river
i
told
you
i
thirsted
for
his
blood
nothing
could
have
cooled
the
fire
of
my
terrible
hate
but
his
poured
out
in
a
free
libation
his
back
was
turned
to
me
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
me
i
crept
up
behind
him
i
oh
sydney
do
not
look
at
me
so
remember
it
was
not
little
queenie
but
a
woman
gone
mad
over
her
terrible
wrongs
i
could
not
help
it
i
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
pushed
him
down
into
the
river
you
are
even
worse
than
i
thought
you
queenie
exclaimed
her
sister
yet
you
a
magdalen
a
murderess
you
dared
to
come
back
to
us
and
to
marry
captain
ernscliffe
i
disclaim
either
of
the
hard
names
you
have
called
me
sydney
her
sister
answered
defiantly
i
have
been
deeply
sinned
against
but
i
have
not
sinned
i
had
no
intention
of
evil
when
i
eloped
with
leon
vinton
i
thought
i
was
his
wife
when
i
lived
with
him
when
i
pushed
him
into
the
river
it
was
a
simple
act
of
justice
if
i
had
gone
home
to
papa
and
told
him
my
wrongs
and
he
had
killed
leon
vinton
society
would
have
applauded
the
act
and
any
jury
would
have
acquitted
him
it
was
right
for
me
to
punish
him
i
gloried
in
the
deed
sydney
made
a
gesture
of
abhorrence
the
only
pity
continued
the
actress
passionately
is
that
i
did
not
succeed
in
my
revenge
he
rose
upon
the
water
once
after
i
pushed
him
in
and
saw
me
on
the
bank
then
he
shook
his
fist
at
me
and
shouted
with
his
mouth
full
of
water
i
live
i
will
have
revenge
for
this
then
he
went
under
again
and
i
ran
away
and
went
home
to
papa
then
he
was
not
drowned
after
all
said
sydney
no
he
was
saved
from
a
watery
grave
and
forthwith
began
to
dog
my
footsteps
again
though
so
cautiously
that
i
never
dreamed
but
that
he
was
dead
the
night
i
was
married
i
saw
him
looking
in
the
window
at
me
but
i
took
him
for
a
ghost
or
an
illusion
of
fancy
never
for
a
moment
as
a
living
creature
but
in
the
moment
that
i
was
made
a
bride
he
sent
me
a
bouquet
i
inhaled
the
perfume
and
fell
senseless
it
was
drugged
with
a
powerful
sleeping
potion
i
was
not
dead
only
asleep
and
unconscious
when
they
buried
me
leon
vinton
resurrected
me
that
night
and
confined
me
as
a
hated
prisoner
at
the
cottage
to
which
he
had
taken
me
a
happy
thoughtless
young
bride
that
was
his
diabolical
revenge
he
knew
where
i
was
all
the
time
but
he
waited
until
the
full
cup
of
happiness
was
pressed
to
my
lips
then
dashed
it
away
and
spilled
the
precious
wine
forever
she
looked
at
her
elder
sister
with
a
tearless
agony
in
her
eyes
but
sydney
only
said
impatiently
i
am
anxious
to
hear
how
you
happened
to
become
such
a
noted
actress
a
few
months
after
my
supposed
death
leon
vinton
was
killed
by
the
outraged
father
of
a
young
girl
whom
he
had
basely
betrayed
in
the
consequent
excitement
my
prison
door
was
left
open
and
i
escaped
and
went
back
to
the
city
toiling
on
through
the
stormy
winter
weather
as
though
it
was
summer
time
in
my
joy
at
the
thought
of
going
back
to
my
home
again
she
wrung
her
jeweled
hands
and
groaned
aloud
oh
heaven
how
little
i
dreamed
of
the
changes
that
awaited
me
in
the
home
from
which
i
had
been
carried
a
seeming
corpse
but
a
few
months
before
papa
was
dead
the
rest
of
you
were
gone
to
europe
there
were
strangers
in
the
house
staggering
blindly
along
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
shock
of
my
father
loss
i
went
to
my
husband
home
alas
he
too
was
traveling
abroad
my
last
prop
was
swept
from
under
me
i
was
homeless
friendless
penniless
and
forsaken
in
the
great
heartless
city
alone
in
the
streets
at
night
beaten
and
tossed
about
by
the
wind
and
storm
oh
if
she
had
but
died
then
breathed
sydney
inaudibly
sydney
try
to
put
yourself
in
my
place
for
a
moment
you
who
have
lain
in
luxury
silken
lap
all
your
life
who
have
never
known
a
sorrow
think
of
your
wronged
little
sister
alone
and
friendless
in
the
dark
and
dangerous
streets
of
the
city
buffeted
by
the
wintery
storms
surely
then
you
will
feel
some
pity
for
all
that
i
have
endured
sydney
would
not
even
look
at
the
sorrowful
face
her
ears
were
deaf
to
the
tremulous
appealing
voice
go
on
with
your
story
she
said
coldly
these
digressions
are
wearisome
what
happened
to
you
then
but
queenie
had
thrown
herself
back
on
the
divan
with
her
white
hands
over
her
face
and
for
a
moment
a
profound
silence
reigned
throughout
the
room
the
little
french
pendule
on
the
mantel
was
ticking
the
hours
toward
noon
but
neither
of
the
two
women
in
their
interest
in
the
present
seemed
to
remember
that
the
actress
had
made
an
appointment
with
captain
ernscliffe
at
that
hour
presently
queenie
spoke
in
a
faint
and
mournful
voice
sydney
i
can
not
go
on
now
i
am
too
faint
and
exhausted
these
painful
recollections
have
wearied
and
depressed
me
wait
a
little
i
must
rest
you
have
come
so
near
to
the
end
of
the
story
surely
you
can
finish
it
now
objected
sydney
unfeelingly
the
actress
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
the
small
hands
dropped
away
from
her
face
and
she
lay
still
with
her
lashes
resting
on
her
white
cheek
a
look
of
pain
and
exhaustion
on
her
delicate
lips
sydney
rose
and
walked
impatiently
up
and
down
the
floor
sydney
said
her
sister
presently
there
is
some
wine
and
glasses
on
the
cabinet
there
will
you
give
me
a
few
drops
perhaps
it
may
rally
my
fainting
strength
sydney
went
to
the
cabinet
and
found
a
flask
of
port
wine
and
delicate
little
crystal
glasses
she
poured
a
little
into
a
glass
and
looked
over
at
her
sister
her
eyes
were
still
closed
and
she
looked
and
pallid
as
she
lay
there
in
her
velvet
dress
and
rich
surroundings
a
terrible
look
came
into
sydney
face
she
put
her
hand
into
her
bosom
and
drew
out
a
little
vial
unstoppered
it
and
poured
a
few
drops
into
the
wine
then
she
crossed
the
room
to
queenie
side
her
eyes
were
burning
with
some
inward
fire
here
queenie
she
said
drink
your
wine
chapter
xxvii
drink
your
wine
queenie
repeated
sydney
in
a
slightly
impatient
voice
the
beautiful
actress
struggled
up
to
a
sitting
posture
and
looked
into
her
sister
face
good
heaven
sydney
what
ails
you
she
said
you
look
positively
ghastly
this
interview
has
been
too
much
for
you
i
entreat
you
to
drink
the
wine
yourself
but
sydney
shook
her
head
although
she
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
and
her
face
was
ashen
white
she
could
scarcely
keep
from
spilling
the
wine
the
glass
wavered
so
unsteadily
in
her
hand
i
insist
upon
it
said
queenie
you
need
a
restorative
as
much
as
i
do
drink
that
yourself
and
give
me
another
glass
a
frightened
look
came
into
sydney
eyes
was
it
possible
that
queenie
had
been
watching
her
from
under
the
hands
that
covered
her
face
i
i
assure
you
i
do
not
need
it
in
the
least
she
faltered
you
looked
so
ghastly
yourself
lying
there
that
i
was
frightened
but
my
nervousness
is
quite
over
now
pray
drink
it
yourself
i
am
anxious
to
see
you
revive
enough
to
continue
your
story
queenie
took
the
in
her
hand
and
raised
it
to
her
lips
sydney
watched
her
with
parted
lips
and
burning
eyes
her
heart
gave
a
bound
of
joy
as
her
unfortunate
sister
touched
the
fatal
draught
with
her
beautiful
lips
they
were
so
absorbed
that
they
had
not
heard
a
rapping
at
the
door
both
were
quite
unconscious
that
the
person
seeking
admittance
had
grown
impatient
and
recklessly
turned
the
handle
but
little
as
they
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
it
was
true
dreadful
crime
had
had
an
spectator
a
man
had
stood
just
inside
the
room
and
watched
her
with
wild
astonished
horrified
eyes
as
queenie
was
about
to
drink
the
wine
he
rushed
forward
and
violently
struck
the
glass
from
her
hand
it
fell
to
the
floor
shattered
into
a
hundred
fragments
the
ruby
wine
splashing
over
the
rich
carpet
the
actress
sprang
to
her
feet
and
confronted
the
daring
intruder
lawrence
ernscliffe
she
gasped
lawrence
ernscliffe
echoed
sydney
in
a
voice
of
horror
yes
lawrence
ernscliffe
he
answered
looking
at
queenie
he
seemed
to
have
no
eyes
for
anyone
but
her
although
his
second
wife
stood
just
at
his
elbow
why
are
you
here
demanded
the
actress
haughtily
the
tall
handsome
man
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
madam
you
permitted
me
to
call
he
said
and
this
is
the
hour
you
specified
i
knocked
but
no
one
came
then
i
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
pride
and
anger
on
the
lovely
face
before
him
softened
strangely
that
is
true
i
had
quite
forgotten
it
she
said
but
then
your
rudeness
in
striking
the
glass
from
my
hand
how
do
you
account
for
that
what
did
you
mean
by
it
her
beautiful
eyes
were
looking
straight
into
his
the
dusky
eyes
of
the
lost
bride
whom
he
had
worshiped
so
madly
his
reason
seemed
to
reel
before
that
wonderful
resemblance
his
heart
was
on
fire
with
the
passion
she
roused
within
him
yet
through
it
all
he
had
a
vague
feeling
that
he
must
shield
sydney
that
he
must
not
betray
her
to
the
beautiful
woman
whom
she
had
wronged
his
dark
eyes
fell
before
her
steady
gaze
his
cheek
reddened
his
tongue
felt
thick
when
he
tried
to
speak
sydney
heart
was
beating
almost
to
suffocation
while
he
stood
thus
hesitating
she
knew
when
he
struck
the
glass
from
queenie
hand
that
he
had
witnessed
her
dastardly
crime
she
wondered
if
his
mad
passion
for
the
beautiful
actress
would
lead
him
to
betray
his
wife
in
her
terror
and
desperation
she
grasped
his
arm
and
looked
up
pleadingly
into
his
face
captain
ernscliffe
looked
down
at
her
oh
the
withering
scorn
the
just
horror
of
that
look
she
shrank
back
abashed
before
it
but
he
slowly
shook
his
head
she
was
safe
he
could
not
forget
that
she
bore
his
name
however
unworthily
i
ask
you
again
sir
said
the
actress
in
a
voice
that
demanded
reply
why
did
you
strike
the
glass
from
my
hand
madam
i
i
pardon
me
i
was
excited
i
knew
not
what
i
did
he
stammered
not
daring
to
meet
her
searching
gaze
suddenly
queenie
uttered
a
cry
of
grief
and
terror
a
little
pet
dog
had
left
his
cushion
in
the
corner
and
lapped
up
the
spilled
wine
from
the
floor
with
its
tiny
pointed
tongue
now
after
a
few
unsteady
motions
and
two
or
three
whining
moans
of
pain
it
uttered
one
sharp
despairing
yelp
rolled
over
upon
the
carpet
and
expired
after
queenie
one
terrified
cry
a
dead
silence
reigned
throughout
the
room
sydney
dropped
into
a
chair
trembling
so
that
she
could
not
stand
and
put
her
hands
before
her
face
her
sin
had
found
her
out
queenie
would
certainly
revenge
herself
now
by
revealing
her
identity
what
mercy
could
she
expect
from
the
sister
she
had
hated
and
tried
to
murder
i
understand
your
reluctance
to
explain
yourself
now
sir
said
the
voice
of
the
actress
falling
on
her
ears
like
the
knell
of
doom
you
would
shield
your
wife
he
did
not
answer
his
head
was
bowed
on
his
breast
his
handsome
face
was
pale
with
emotion
she
went
on
coldly
after
a
moment
pause
i
thank
you
captain
ernscliffe
for
the
ready
hand
that
struck
the
poisoned
wine
from
my
lips
although
my
life
is
so
valueless
to
me
that
it
was
scarcely
worth
the
saving
but
now
will
you
withdraw
and
leave
me
to
deal
with
this
lady
sydney
glanced
up
through
the
fingers
that
hid
her
shamed
face
what
did
queenie
mean
to
do
was
it
possible
that
she
would
not
reveal
her
identity
to
her
husband
madam
he
remonstrated
you
were
willing
to
accord
me
an
interview
surely
you
will
not
send
me
away
like
this
i
can
not
go
until
i
have
told
you
why
i
am
here
the
resolution
in
his
voice
alarmed
her
she
stepped
back
a
pace
and
stood
looking
at
him
with
parted
lips
and
burning
eyes
her
face
as
white
as
marble
against
the
background
of
her
rich
but
somber
velvet
robe
her
loosened
golden
hair
falling
around
her
like
a
veil
of
light
we
i
that
is
you
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
that
i
wish
to
hear
she
panted
pray
go
let
us
part
as
we
met
strangers
he
looked
at
her
with
a
strange
light
in
his
dark
eyes
a
warm
flush
creeping
into
his
face
sydney
watched
him
with
wild
fascinated
eyes
what
would
he
say
to
this
speech
of
the
actress
we
have
not
met
as
strangers
we
can
not
part
thus
he
answered
firmly
surely
my
eyes
and
my
heart
can
not
both
deceive
me

reine
blanche
you
are

lost
wife

chapter
xxviii
you
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
in
the
room
so
utter
was
the
silence
that
followed
captain
ernscliffe
bold
declaration
sydney
remained
crouching
in
her
chair
watching
the
two
chief
actors
in
this
drama
in
real
life
with
wild
fascinated
eyes
feeling
that
her
whole
future
hung
trembling
in
the
balance
on
the
answer
that
must
fall
from
her
sister
lips
queenie
seemed
stricken
dumb
by
the
words
of
captain
ernscliffe
she
stared
at
him
speechlessly
her
white
teeth
buried
in
her
crimson
lips
her
hands
clenched
tightly
together
queenie
you
can
not
deny
it
he
went
on
passionately
seeing
that
she
could
not
or
would
not
speak
although
i
thought
you
dead
although
the
last
time
i
beheld
your
sweet
face
it
was
under
the
shadow
of
the
yet
i
could
swear
that
the
lost
bride
whom
i
deemed
an
angel
in
heaven
still
walks
the
earth
under
the
name
of
reine
de
lisle
still
she
did
not
answer
still
she
stood
there
pale
and
all
the
life
that
was
left
in
her
seeming
concentrated
in
the
burning
gaze
she
fixed
upon
his
face
he
ventured
to
come
a
little
nearer
he
touched
the
white
jeweled
hands
that
were
locked
so
tightly
together
he
altogether
forgot
sydney
crouching
silently
in
the
great
he
took
up
a
long
curling
tress
of
the
golden
hair
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
my
darling
he
cried
speak
to
me
tell
me
by
what
strange
mystery
you
were
resurrected
and
restored
to
my
heart
why
have
you
remained
so
long
away
from
me
the
touch
of
his
hands
and
lips
seemed
to
galvanize
her
into
life
she
pushed
him
away
and
sprang
to
sydney
side
madam
she
cried
indignantly
what
ails
your
husband
is
he
mad
why
does
he
claim
me
as
his
wife
sydney
heart
gave
one
wild
passionate
throb
of
joy
queenie
had
declared
herself
she
would
renounce
her
husband
taking
the
cue
instantly
she
sprang
up
and
fixed
a
pleading
gaze
on
the
beautiful
white
face
of
the
actress
oh
madame
de
lisle
forgive
him
she
cried
you
are
the
living
image
of
his
first
wife
whom
he
adored
and
who
died
at
the
altar
your
perfect
resemblance
to
her
has
driven
him
mad
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
the
dark
radiant
brunette
the
blonde
each
so
perfect
in
her
type
and
his
heart
sank
heavily
had
they
conspired
to
deceive
him
or
was
this
wonderful
resemblance
to
his
lost
bride
but
a
mere
coincidence
a
an
to
lead
his
heart
and
his
reason
astray
cease
sydney
he
said
sternly
she
can
not
deny
it
she
will
not
utter
such
a
stupendous
falsehood
my
heart
is
too
true
a
monitor
to
lead
me
astray
it
never
throbbed
as
it
does
now
in
the
presence
of
any
woman
on
earth
but
queenie
lyle
how
noble
and
handsome
he
looked
as
he
stood
there
pleading
for
his
love
with
all
his
tender
passionate
heart
shining
in
his
dark
eyes
the
actress
gave
one
look
at
him
then
turned
away
and
walked
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
she
could
not
bear
the
mute
agonizing
appeal
in
his
beautiful
troubled
dark
eyes
sydney
sprang
to
his
side
and
clasped
her
hands
about
his
arm
oh
lawrence
she
cried
you
break
my
heart
i
tremble
for
your
reason
oh
pray
pray
come
away
from
here
madame
de
lisle
is
very
angry
with
you
for
your
persistence
in
your
strange
mistake
you
intrude
upon
her
hours
for
study
and
practice
will
you
not
come
away
with
me
he
looked
down
at
her
suspiciously
without
stirring
from
the
spot
sydney
if
indeed
i
am
mistaken
he
said
why
are
here
if
this
lady
is
not
your
sister
what
have
you
to
do
with
her
why
he
lowered
his
voice
slightly
why
did
you
seek
to
remove
her
from
your
path
sydney
dropped
her
eyes
and
turned
crimson
oh
lawrence
she
said
she
is
not
my
sister
but
she
is
my
rival
i
know
all
that
passed
last
night
i
know
that
she
has
won
your
heart
from
me
it
was
never
yours
sydney
he
answered
firmly
i
married
you
because
you
loved
me
and
were
unhappy
without
me
but
you
never
held
my
heart
i
have
never
loved
but
one
woman
on
earth
i
told
you
that
before
i
made
you
my
wife
the
listener
heart
gave
one
great
bound
of
joy
he
loved
her
still
he
had
never
loved
but
her
why
should
she
sacrifice
herself
and
him
for
the
doubtful
good
of
sydney
happiness
a
great
wave
of
pity
for
herself
and
for
her
true
loyal
husband
swept
over
her
heart
she
made
a
quick
step
toward
him
as
if
to
throw
herself
upon
his
breast
then
shrank
back
into
herself
deterred
by
the
agonised
appeal
in
the
eyes
of
sydney
who
seemed
to
divine
her
purpose
oh
lawrence
entreated
sydney
pray
go
away
from
here
madame
de
lisle
grows
impatient
the
actress
swept
across
the
room
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
held
it
open
ernscliffe
is
right
she
said
in
a
cold
hard
tone
i
am
both
weary
and
impatient
i
can
bear
no
more
this
trespass
on
my
time
and
patience
is
inexcusable
will
it
please
you
to
go
now
sir
lawrence
ernscliffe
advanced
and
stood
before
her
in
the
doorway
she
could
not
bear
the
passionate
pain
and
reproach
in
the
beautiful
eyes
he
fastened
on
her
face
her
gaze
wavered
and
fell
before
his
queenie
he
said
slowly
and
sadly
you
have
not
deceived
me
you
can
not
deny
that
you
are
my
own
your
soul
is
too
white
and
pure
to
suffer
such
a
falsehood
to
stain
your
lips
yet
you
will
not
let
me
claim
you
you
are
sacrificing
your
happiness
and
mine
for
a
mere
chimera
i
understand
it
all
sydney
has
asked
for
the
sacrifice
and
you
have
made
it
it
is
for
he
bent
down
lifted
a
spray
of
white
hyacinth
that
had
fallen
from
the
lace
on
her
breast
to
the
floor
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
silently
withdrew
queenie
closed
the
door
upon
his
retreating
form
and
turned
back
to
her
sister
he
was
right
she
said
slowly
i
have
sacrificed
my
happiness
and
his
for
your
sake
sydney
sydney
lifted
her
heavy
eyes
and
looked
at
her
without
speaking
queenie
went
on
slowly
this
is
my
revenge
sydney
you
have
scorned
and
insulted
me
you
have
branded
me
with
a
cruel
name
you
have
tried
to
poison
me
me
the
little
sister
you
loved
and
petted
when
we
were
children
at
our
mother
knee
yet
for
the
sake
of
those
old
days
and
the
love
we
had
for
each
other
then
i
forgive
you
nay
more
i
make
the
sacrifice
you
were
cruel
enough
to
ask
of
me
i
resign
the
one
being
whom
i
have
sought
for
years
the
one
thing
dear
to
me
upon
earth
i
give
you
the
pulse
of
my
heart
the
life
of
my
life
the
soul
of
my
soul
cold
and
white
as
marble
in
her
sublime
she
pointed
to
the
door
go
she
said
i
can
bear
no
more
sydney
obeyed
her
without
a
word
then
the
beautiful
queen
of
tragedy
the
lovely
woman
who
counted
her
admirers
by
the
hundreds
knelt
down
upon
the
floor
and
lifted
her
white
despairing
face
to
heaven
oh
god
she
moaned
if
indeed
i
am
a
sinner
as
she
said
surely
this
great
and
bitter
sacrifice
for
another
sake
must
win
for
me
the
pity
and
pardon
of
heaven
chapter
xxix
the
three
weeks
of
la
reine
blanche
london
engagement
were
drawing
to
a
close
she
had
achieved
a
brilliant
success
her
beauty
and
her
genius
were
the
themes
of
every
tongue
her
admirers
were
legion
she
had
a
score
of
wealthy
and
titled
lovers
it
was
even
said
that
a
noble
and
duke
had
proposed
to
marry
her
and
met
with
a
cold
and
haughty
refusal
the
managers
of
the
theater
where
she
was
playing
tried
to
secure
her
for
another
month
it
would
be
worth
a
fortune
to
them
they
said
and
they
allowed
her
to
make
her
own
terms
to
their
consternation
she
utterly
declined
a
longer
engagement
and
announced
her
intention
to
retire
from
the
stage
the
managers
were
astounded
what
retire
from
the
stage
in
the
zenith
of
her
fame
with
all
her
gifts
of
youth
beauty
and
genius
it
was
too
dreadful
yet
in
spite
of
their
remonstrances
she
persevered
she
canceled
at
a
tremendous
cost
an
engagement
she
had
made
with
a
parisian
manager
a
whisper
was
circulated
and
began
to
gain
credence
that
the
beautiful
was
about
to
enter
a
convent
and
take
the
veil
for
life
she
did
not
deny
it
when
people
questioned
her
but
she
would
not
tell
the
reason
why
she
was
about
to
take
such
a
strange
step
she
only
smiled
sadly
when
they
remonstrated
with
her
but
she
would
never
tell
why
she
was
about
to
immure
herself
with
all
her
gifts
of
beauty
youth
and
genius
in
a
living
tomb
but
there
was
one
thing
that
was
palpable
to
all
who
saw
her
off
the
stage
and
divested
of
the
trickery
of
paint
and
cosmetics
la
reine
blanche
was
fading
like
the
frailest
summer
flower
the
lily
bloomed
on
her
cheek
instead
of
the
rose
under
her
large
blue
eyes
lay
purple
shadows
darker
and
deeper
than
those
cast
by
the
drooping
lashes
a
look
of
patient
suffering
crept
about
the
corners
of
her
lips
and
hid
in
her
eyes
her
smiles
were
sadder
and
more
pathetic
than
sighs
her
form
grew
slighter
and
more
ethereal
in
its
perfect
grace
her
step
lost
its
lightness
and
elasticity
some
said
that
the
beautiful
actress
was
dying
of
a
broken
heart
others
said
that
she
was
falling
into
a
consumption
she
heard
these
things
and
made
no
outward
sign
but
inwardly
she
said
to
herself
they
are
both
right
and
wrong
i
am
dying
because
i
have
nothing
left
to
live
for
i
have
toiled
and
hoped
for
years
i
have
studied
and
practiced
to
get
money
to
carry
me
over
the
wide
world
in
search
of
the
one
true
heart
that
was
mine
only
and
now
that
i
have
found
it
i
have
had
to
give
it
away
i
can
not
endure
it
i
am
not
strong
enough
there
is
nothing
left
me
but
to
die
she
thought
of
some
sorrowful
lines
she
had
somewhere
read
and
mournfully
repeated
them
much
must
be
borne
which
is
hard
to
bear
much
given
away
which
it
were
sweet
to
keep
god
helps
us
all
who
need
indeed
his
care
and
yet
i
know
the
shepherd
loves
his
sheep
those
flying
rumors
and
reports
only
served
to
make
madame
de
lisle
more
popular
she
was
the
rage
she
played
to
densely
packed
houses
every
night
flowers
rained
upon
her
the
costliest
gifts
of
jewels
and
rare
were
sent
to
her
from
such
unknown
sources
that
she
could
neither
refuse
nor
send
them
back
as
she
would
otherwise
have
done
there
was
always
a
great
throng
of
people
waiting
to
see
her
step
into
the
carriage
every
night
but
in
all
that
throng
la
reine
blanche
never
saw
but
one
face
there
was
one
man
who
always
held
the
same
position
beside
her
carriage
door
he
never
spoke
to
her
he
never
touched
her
but
stood
there
patiently
every
night
thrilled
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
if
the
hem
of
her
perfumed
robe
but
brushed
him
in
passing
some
weird
fascination
utterly
beyond
her
power
of
resistance
always
impelled
her
to
meet
his
glance
and
the
fire
in
his
beautiful
dark
eyes
the
passionate
love
the
terrible
pain
the
bitter
reproach
were
killing
her
slowly
but
surely
and
lawrence
ernscliffe
was
going
mad
he
had
no
life
no
thought
no
hope
outside
the
beautiful
woman
whom
he
had
claimed
for
his
wife
and
who
had
so
coldly
denied
him
he
haunted
her
like
her
own
shadow
go
where
she
would
she
saw
him
look
where
she
would
she
met
only
the
eyes
of
the
man
she
loved
and
to
whom
she
belonged
by
the
dearest
tie
on
earth
he
forgot
sydney
utterly
or
if
he
ever
remembered
her
it
was
only
with
scorn
her
terrible
sin
had
placed
her
beyond
the
pale
of
his
tenderness
forever
no
reasoning
no
sophistry
could
have
convinced
him
that
the
beautiful
actress
was
not
his
own
wife
whom
he
had
lost
in
the
very
moment
that
made
her
his
bride
he
could
not
have
explained
himself
he
did
not
understand
at
all
the
mysterious
chance
which
had
brought
it
about
yet
he
knew
in
his
own
heart
that
the
woman
whom
he
had
seen
in
her
coffin
once
had
been
restored
to
life
again
and
that
the
only
bar
to
their
happiness
now
was
sydney
whom
he
had
married
through
a
simple
impulse
of
pity
chapter
xxx
it
was
the
last
night
of
madame
de
lisle
engagement
she
would
make
her
final
appearance
before
the
world
in
the
beautiful
tragedy
of
king
lear
she
would
retire
to
the
conventional
cloister
forever
the
theater
was
so
densely
packed
that
there
was
scarcely
on
this
her
farewell
night
lord
valentine
and
his
wife
and
were
in
his
box
from
which
they
had
scarcely
missed
a
night
of
the
three
weeks
besides
lyle
passionate
love
of
the
drama
there
was
a
subtle
fascination
in
madame
de
lisle
strange
resemblance
to
her
youngest
daughter
that
impelled
her
thither
every
night
to
gaze
upon
her
with
eyes
that
never
wearied
in
looking
on
her
loveliness
she
could
not
have
told
why
it
was
but
she
was
vaguely
conscious
of
a
troubled
tenderness
about
her
heart
whenever
she
looked
at
the
fair
young
creature
and
heard
the
talk
of
her
going
into
a
convent
she
makes
me
think
of
poor
queenie
she
whispered
to
georgina
that
night
i
can
not
help
feeling
sorry
for
her
she
is
so
like
what
she
was
the
resemblance
is
startling
indeed
lady
valentine
whispered
back
but
do
let
sydney
hear
you
mamma
she
does
not
like
to
hear
about
it
sydney
made
no
sign
but
she
knew
very
well
what
they
were
talking
of
she
came
to
the
theater
every
night
though
she
hated
to
be
there
jealousy
drove
her
to
look
on
her
rival
face
every
night
that
she
might
also
watch
her
husband
poor
sydney
she
sat
there
pale
and
haggard
and
wretched
in
her
white
satin
and
diamonds
looking
with
jealous
suspicious
eyes
at
the
beautiful
and
gentle
cordelia
hating
her
for
the
fairness
that
lawrence
ernscliffe
loved
queenie
sacrifice
made
at
so
costly
a
price
to
herself
had
utterly
failed
to
purchase
her
sister
happiness
captain
ernscliffe
had
a
seat
in
another
part
of
the
house
where
sydney
could
watch
his
every
movement
her
heart
swelled
with
bitter
pain
and
passionate
anger
as
she
looked
at
him
he
did
not
even
seem
to
know
that
she
was
there
his
dark
melancholy
eyes
never
once
moved
from
the
graceful
form
of
the
unhappy
cordelia
as
she
acted
her
part
on
the
stage
when
the
curtain
fell
he
dropped
his
eyes
and
never
looked
up
again
until
his
beautiful
idol
reappeared
la
reine
blanche
had
never
acted
better
she
gave
her
whole
attention
to
her
part
she
did
not
seem
to
see
that
one
pair
of
eyes
had
watched
her
with
such
wild
entreaty
and
passionate
love
in
their
beautiful
depths
there
was
one
box
at
which
she
never
looked
but
once
and
it
was
when
in
obedience
to
her
husband
command
bid
farewell
to
your
sisters
she
slowly
repeated
jewels
of
our
father
with
washed
eyes
cordelia
leaves
you
i
know
you
what
you
are
and
like
a
sister
am
most
loth
to
call
your
faults
as
they
are
named
love
well
our
father
to
your
professed
bosoms
i
commit
him
but
yet
alas
stood
i
within
his
grace
i
would
prefer
him
to
a
better
place
so
farewell
to
you
both
everyone
in
the
house
saw
her
brilliant
eyes
fixed
on
lord
box
as
she
repeated
those
words
but
perhaps
no
one
but
the
actress
herself
saw
that
sydney
eyes
drooped
in
shame
and
confusion
while
a
scarlet
blush
stained
her
cheek
ah
she
and
no
other
comprehended
the
bitter
meaning
of
words
as
she
fixed
her
blue
eyes
mournfully
on
the
sister
who
had
wronged
her
so
deeply
this
is
her
last
night
sydney
murmured
to
herself
but
is
it
true
that
she
will
go
into
a
convent
i
must
see
her
i
must
know
the
truth
for
certain
i
will
go
round
to
her
and
ask
her
when
the
act
was
over
she
complained
of
sickness
and
asked
lord
valentine
to
take
her
down
to
the
carriage
lord
valentine
complied
and
left
her
sitting
in
the
carriage
the
coachman
mounting
to
his
box
but
in
a
moment
before
the
two
prancing
horses
had
started
sydney
slipped
out
of
the
carriage
so
noiselessly
that
the
man
drove
on
never
dreaming
but
that
she
was
shut
up
within
then
she
ran
round
breathlessly
to
the
private
entrance
of
the
theater
she
told
the
man
who
kept
the
door
that
she
had
an
engagement
with
madame
de
lisle
and
desired
him
to
show
her
to
that
two
minutes
later
she
found
herself
alone
in
the
small
apartment
where
the
actress
changed
her
costumes
for
the
different
acts
and
scenes
queenie
had
not
yet
come
in
the
manager
had
detained
her
a
few
minutes
and
sydney
had
time
to
draw
breath
and
look
about
her
while
she
waited
for
her
sister
there
was
not
much
to
see
the
room
was
dingy
and
sparely
furnished
as
the
of
a
theater
is
apt
to
be
costumes
were
laid
over
the
backs
of
chairs
and
the
maid
who
should
have
been
guarding
them
was
off
duty
gossiping
no
doubt
with
some
humble
of
the
place
there
was
little
to
interest
one
and
sydney
grew
impatient
suddenly
she
saw
a
letter
lying
carelessly
on
the
toilet
table
she
took
it
up
and
looked
at
it
it
was
addressed
to
madame
de
lisle
and
had
never
been
unsealed
it
has
been
left
here
during
the
first
act
and
queenie
has
never
seen
it
she
said
to
herself
it
looks
like
my
husband
writing
i
will
see
what
he
has
to
say
to
her
recklessly
desperately
she
tore
it
open
and
drew
out
the
sheet
of
note
paper
my
darling
it
said
simply
meet
me
at
the
western
door
after
the
first
act
is
over
i
see
you
a
moment
no
name
was
signed
to
the
mysterious
note
but
sydney
felt
sure
that
it
was
her
husband
writing
queenie
has
deceived
me
she
said
to
herself
angrily
she
is
in
collusion
with
lawrence
i
might
have
known
she
would
play
me
false
she
looked
about
her
hurriedly
a
long
black
silk
circular
lined
with
fur
hung
over
a
chair
she
put
it
on
over
her
white
dress
caught
up
a
thick
veil
winding
it
about
her
head
and
face
and
hurried
out
to
the
retired
western
door
outside
in
the
darkness
stood
a
tall
muffled
form
queenie
is
it
you
he
said
in
unfamiliar
tones
in
a
moment
she
realized
her
mistake
it
was
not
her
husband
but
in
the
hope
of
unearthing
some
fatal
mystery
she
said
softly
yes
it
is
queenie
these
words
sealed
her
doom
the
man
sprang
forward
and
caught
her
by
the
arm
something
bright
and
slender
gleamed
an
instant
in
his
upraised
hand
and
then
was
sheathed
in
her
heart
as
her
terrible
scream
of
agony
divided
the
shuddering
air
he
turned
and
fled
from
the
scene
of
his
crime
but
poor
sydney
the
victim
of
her
own
misguided
passion
lay
there
dying
with
the
deadly
steel
of
the
assassin
sheathed
in
her
jealous
breast
chapter
xxxi
that
wild
and
piercing
cry
penetrated
to
many
ears
the
manager
and
the
actress
heard
it
where
they
stood
conversing
together
and
though
queenie
did
not
know
that
it
was
sydney
voice
still
she
grew
pale
as
death
and
an
indefinable
fear
crept
coldly
around
her
heart
the
manager
put
her
into
a
chair
for
he
saw
that
she
could
not
stand
stay
here
until
i
return
he
said
i
will
go
and
see
what
has
happened
he
hurried
round
to
the
western
door
from
which
the
sound
had
seemed
to
proceed
a
little
knot
of
theater
had
preceded
him
they
were
gathered
round
the
prostrate
form
and
one
had
unwound
the
shrouding
veil
from
her
pale
face
and
exposed
it
to
the
air
and
light
her
dark
eyes
were
staring
upward
with
a
look
of
pain
and
horror
in
their
starry
depths
her
face
was
ashen
white
her
lips
quivered
with
faint
anguished
moans
and
her
white
jeweled
hands
worked
convulsively
at
the
hilt
of
the
dagger
whose
deadly
blade
was
buried
in
her
breast
she
looked
up
at
the
manager
as
he
bent
over
her
a
gleam
of
recognition
came
into
her
eyes
i
am
dying
she
said
in
a
faint
gasping
voice
let
someone
go
into
the
theater
and
bring
captain
ernscliffe
do
let
anyone
else
know
i
am
here
queenie
i
mean
madame
de
lisle
must
not
know
let
the
play
go
on
at
that
moment
they
brought
a
physician
summoned
in
haste
from
his
seat
in
the
theater
he
knelt
down
and
tried
to
draw
the
dagger
from
her
breast
but
desisted
in
a
moment
and
shook
his
head
ominously
tell
me
the
truth
she
moaned
how
many
minutes
have
i
to
live
the
physician
looked
down
at
her
with
a
grave
pity
in
his
kindly
eyes
only
as
long
as
the
dagger
remains
in
the
wound
he
answered
gently
when
that
is
removed
you
will
bleed
to
death
in
a
minute
she
clasped
both
hands
around
the
murderous
steel
as
if
to
drive
it
deeper
into
her
heart
let
it
remain
there
then
she
gasped
i
have
something
to
say
before
i
go
hence
great
heaven
who
has
done
this
exclaimed
a
shocked
voice
they
all
looked
around
it
was
captain
ernscliffe
who
spoke
he
knelt
down
by
his
wife
and
looked
at
the
murderous
dagger
whose
hilt
she
grasped
with
eyes
full
of
horror
the
pain
in
her
face
softened
she
put
out
one
hand
to
him
and
he
clasped
it
in
his
own
lawrence
i
have
been
cruelly
murdered
she
moaned
let
someone
take
my
dying
deposition
the
manager
hurriedly
produced
pencil
and
paper
i
went
into
madame
de
lisle
she
began
she
had
not
come
in
and
i
waited
a
little
while
wishing
to
speak
to
her
have
you
put
that
down
the
manager
replied
in
the
affirmative
i
saw
a
sealed
letter
lying
on
the
table
she
went
on
slowly
and
painfully
i
was
jealous
of
madame
de
lisle
to
whom
it
was
addressed
i
thought
my
husband
had
written
it
i
opened
it
i
read
it
the
physician
stopped
her
a
minute
to
pour
a
few
drops
of
something
between
her
panting
lips
then
she
went
on
it
was
only
a
line
imploring
her
to
meet
him
for
a
moment
at
the
western
door
no
name
was
signed
but
i
was
foolish
enough
to
believe
it
was
my
husband
her
dark
eyes
lifted
to
his
a
moment
with
a
mute
appeal
for
forgiveness
in
their
dusky
depths
he
pressed
her
hand
and
murmured
my
poor
sydney
she
lay
still
a
moment
while
great
drops
of
dew
beaded
her
white
brow
forced
out
by
her
terrible
suffering
can
we
do
nothing
to
help
her
captain
ernscliffe
inquired
anxiously
as
he
pillowed
the
dark
head
gently
on
his
arm
the
physician
shook
his
head
gravely
no
nothing
sydney
answered
him
herself
only
stay
by
me
till
the
last
let
me
finish
my
story
captain
ernscliffe
wiped
the
cold
dews
of
death
from
her
brow
and
she
continued
i
took
madame
de
lisle
cloak
and
put
it
over
my
dress
i
tied
her
veil
about
my
head
and
face
and
and
went
to
the
western
door
myself
oh
god
this
dagger
how
it
hurts
my
side
a
few
moans
of
terrible
agony
then
she
went
on
gaspingly
there
was
a
tall
dark
man
outside
the
door
he
said
it
you
queenie
then
i
saw
my
mistake
it
was
not
my
husband
but
i
thought
i
might
learn
some
fatal
secret
of
hers
so
i
answered
yes
she
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
and
a
groan
of
mortal
agony
broke
from
her
white
lips
that
falsehood
sealed
my
doom
he
sprang
forward
without
a
word
buried
this
dagger
in
my
breast
and
fled
it
was
madame
de
lisle
enemy
i
know
now
i
received
in
my
heart
the
stroke
that
was
meant
for
hers
she
paused
then
repressing
a
groan
of
pain
said
feebly
have
you
written
it
all
down
yes
madam
the
manager
answered
very
well
i
want
you
all
to
go
away
now
i
want
to
be
alone
with
my
husband
do
let
anyone
else
know
i
am
here
the
play
must
not
be
stopped
let
him
be
all
mine
a
little
longer
they
turned
away
in
wonder
at
her
strange
words
and
left
her
lying
there
supported
on
her
husband
arm
the
beautiful
woman
with
the
diamonds
in
her
dark
hair
and
the
dagger
hilt
above
her
heart
her
white
hand
grasping
it
convulsively
while
she
panted
forth
to
him
her
strange
story
in
the
briefest
words
she
could
find
for
her
strength
was
ebbing
fast
and
her
pain
was
becoming
almost
unendurable
the
manager
went
back
to
the
actress
and
told
her
some
plausible
tale
to
allay
her
fears
and
as
sydney
had
wished
the
play
went
on
the
foolish
fond
old
lear
ranted
and
raved
his
little
hour
the
cruel
sisters
of
cordelia
even
poor
cordelia
herself
all
died
their
mimic
deaths
upon
the
stage
little
dreaming
that
a
tragedy
in
real
life
had
been
enacted
so
close
and
so
near
and
that
poor
erring
sydney
lay
dead
beneath
the
same
roof
where
the
vast
throng
of
people
wept
and
applauded
at
the
superb
rendition
of
shakespeare
grand
creation
king
lear
yet
so
it
was
for
when
sydney
had
faltered
out
her
mournful
story
she
looked
up
at
captain
ernscliffe
and
said
with
a
quivering
sigh
i
have
done
now
lawrence
and
the
pain
is
so
great
i
can
not
bear
it
any
longer
will
you
draw
the
dagger
from
my
wound
and
let
me
die
but
he
shrank
back
aghast
at
her
words
oh
sydney
do
ask
me
will
you
not
see
them
all
first
and
say
your
mother
your
sisters
no
no
i
want
none
but
you
she
moaned
and
oh
my
god
how
terrible
the
pain
is
yet
lawrence
i
will
stay
yet
a
little
longer
i
will
try
to
bear
it
still
if
you
will
kneel
down
there
and
pray
for
me
i
am
such
a
sinner
i
am
almost
to
do
you
repent
sydney
he
asked
gently
do
i
she
wailed
oh
my
god
i
am
sorry
for
it
all
now
tell
her
i
tried
to
make
atonement
at
the
last
she
will
forgive
me
little
queenie
was
always
very
pray
for
me
now
ask
god
to
forgive
me
too
he
bowed
his
head
and
prayed
fervently
for
the
welfare
of
the
soul
about
to
be
launched
upon
the
shoreless
waters
of
eternity
when
the
low
amen
vibrated
on
the
night
air
she
looked
up
and
said
moaningly
have
you
forgiven
me
too
lawrence
he
bent
and
kissed
the
poor
pale
quivering
lips
all
is
forgiven
sydney
he
answered
gently
then
call
the
physician
she
moaned
let
him
draw
this
cruel
steel
from
my
breast
i
can
not
bear
it
any
longer
but
the
physician
recoiled
as
captain
ernscliffe
had
done
when
she
told
him
what
she
wished
him
to
do
i
should
feel
like
a
murderer
he
gasped
you
could
not
live
a
minute
after
the
blade
was
drawn
out
of
your
breast
she
turned
away
from
him
and
put
out
her
hand
to
the
man
she
loved
so
madly
farewell
lawrence
she
said
think
of
me
sometimes
as
of
one
who
loved
you
wisely
but
too
well
then
before
they
even
guessed
what
she
was
about
to
do
she
clasped
both
hands
about
the
dagger
hilt
and
with
a
terrible
effort
wrenched
it
from
her
breast
and
threw
it
far
from
her
her
heart
blood
spurted
out
in
a
great
warm
crimson
tide
over
the
bodice
of
her
white
satin
dress
she
quivered
from
head
to
foot
and
died
with
her
dim
eyes
fixed
in
a
long
last
look
of
love
on
lawrence
ernscliffe
handsome
face
when
the
play
was
over
and
the
beautiful
actress
was
leaving
the
theater
for
the
last
time
someone
touched
her
arm
and
detained
her
she
looked
up
into
the
pale
face
of
captain
ernscliffe
nay
queenie
he
said
gently
you
need
not
shrink
from
me
now
sydney
has
confessed
all
she
looked
up
at
him
in
wonder
as
he
drew
her
hand
lovingly
within
his
arm
she
has
given
you
up
to
me
and
you
know
she
repeated
like
one
dazed
yes
queenie
i
know
all
and
i
am
yours
alone
now
for
prepare
yourself
for
a
great
shock
my
darling
your
sister
sydney
is
dead
chapter
xxxii
dead
exclaimed
queenie
with
a
start
of
horror
oh
no
that
can
not
be
it
is
but
a
little
while
since
i
saw
her
living
and
beautiful
under
this
roof
her
body
is
here
still
queenie
but
her
soul
has
fled
to
the
god
who
gave
it
he
answered
solemnly
she
trembled
like
a
leaf
in
a
storm
at
that
grave
assurance
queenie
let
me
take
you
back
to
your
he
said
stay
there
a
little
while
until
i
come
for
you
utterly
unnerved
by
the
shock
of
his
revelation
she
suffered
him
to
lead
her
back
he
left
her
at
the
door
of
her
room
and
went
out
to
seek
lord
valentine
he
had
just
put
his
wife
and
into
the
carriage
and
stood
talking
with
the
driver
on
the
pavement
yes
sir
the
man
was
saying
you
know
you
brought
her
out
and
put
her
into
the
carriage
yourself
and
i
jumped
up
on
the
box
and
drove
right
off
but
when
i
got
to
valentine
house
my
lord
the
carriage
was
empty
yet
i
could
swear
to
you
my
lord
that
the
carriage
was
never
stopped
an
instant
between
here
and
home
come
with
me
my
lord
said
captain
ernscliffe
in
a
whisper
as
he
touched
his
arm
i
will
explain
the
mystery
very
well
let
the
carriage
wait
until
i
return
he
said
to
the
man
as
he
walked
away
with
his
captain
ernscliffe
led
him
back
into
the
theater
where
sydney
lay
still
and
cold
in
death
watched
by
the
manager
and
several
of
the
theater
employes
they
had
lifted
the
body
and
laid
it
on
a
pile
of
silken
cushions
to
remain
until
it
had
been
viewed
by
the
coroner
who
had
been
immediately
notified
of
the
terrible
event
at
a
whispered
request
the
manager
gave
the
paper
containing
the
dying
deposition
of
sydney
into
ernscliffe
hands
and
he
in
turn
passed
it
over
to
lord
valentine
great
heaven
this
is
terrible
he
exclaimed
looking
down
at
the
rigid
form
of
his
what
is
to
be
done
who
will
break
the
news
to
her
mother
and
sister
they
walked
apart
and
captain
ernscliffe
briefly
told
him
the
truth
that
madame
reine
de
lisle
was
his
lost
wife
queenie
and
that
sydney
knowledge
of
that
fact
had
maddened
her
with
suspicion
and
jealousy
and
driven
her
into
the
fatal
error
that
had
cost
her
her
life
it
is
too
wonderful
to
be
true
said
lord
valentine
i
can
not
believe
that
the
woman
i
saw
lying
dead
in
her
coffin
has
been
so
strangely
resurrected
surely
ernscliffe
this
beautiful
actress
has
but
traded
on
her
wonderful
resemblance
to
your
lost
bride
and
deceived
you
and
sydney
both
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
beautiful
siren
captain
ernscliffe
looked
at
him
half
angrily
my
lord
valentine
he
answered
haughtily
you
charge
her
with
that
of
which
she
is
not
guilty
she
has
not
deceived
us
she
did
not
seek
us
we
sought
her
and
as
long
as
sydney
lived
she
evaded
the
truth
and
would
not
acknowledge
her
identity
to
me
because
my
second
wife
had
begged
her
to
sacrifice
herself
for
her
sake
but
come
with
me
since
you
doubt
her
identity
let
us
see
if
she
will
recognize
you
if
you
appear
as
a
stranger
to
her
we
may
then
afford
to
doubt
her
they
went
to
queenie
and
knocked
on
the
door
she
opened
it
and
bade
them
enter
in
a
faltering
voice
with
her
cheeks
bathed
in
tears
her
blue
eyes
downcast
and
troubled
queenie
look
up
said
captain
ernscliffe
do
you
recognize
this
gentleman
the
actress
lifted
her
lovely
eyes
dimmed
with
bitter
weeping
and
looked
at
him
a
gleam
of
recognition
shone
in
her
face
yes
she
answered
in
her
sweet
low
voice
it
is
lord
valentine
who
was
married
to
my
sister
georgina
the
night
you
married
me
captain
ernscliffe
flashed
a
triumphant
look
upon
his
you
see
she
knows
all
about
us
he
said
now
you
can
not
but
admit
her
identity
you
must
believe
that
she
is
my
wife
lord
valentine
grew
white
and
red
by
turns
as
he
gazed
upon
the
beautiful
queenly
woman
i
admit
madam
wonderful
beauty
her
grace
and
her
talent
he
said
slowly
and
i
will
not
deny
her
astonishing
resemblance
to
your
lost
bride
but
ernscliffe
i
will
not
believe
this
story
of
poor
queenie
resurrection
you
are
the
victim
of
a
monstrous
fraud
captain
ernscliffe
eyes
blazed
with
anger
you
deny
that
this
is
my
wife
he
exclaimed
passionately
lord
valentine
was
silent
a
moment
after
that
brief
pause
for
thought
he
answered
firmly
yes
i
utterly
deny
it
i
will
not
believe
in
so
stupendous
a
fraud
as
this
one
which
is
being
perpetrated
upon
you
madame
de
lisle
is
a
beautiful
woman
and
a
great
actress
but
she
is
not
the
wife
you
buried
years
ago
in
rose
hill
cemetery
queenie
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
him
proudly
but
she
did
not
speak
one
word
in
her
own
defense
she
did
not
need
to
do
so
she
had
an
eloquent
defender
by
her
side
since
you
think
thus
said
captain
ernscliffe
repressing
his
anger
and
excitement
by
a
powerful
effort
of
his
will
pray
go
to
your
wife
and
break
the
news
of
sydney
tragic
death
to
her
and
her
mother
you
may
tell
them
also
all
that
i
have
told
you
and
we
will
see
if
they
will
decide
as
you
have
done
lord
valentine
bowed
coldly
and
went
away
captain
ernscliffe
turned
to
the
beautiful
woman
who
had
fallen
into
a
seat
and
buried
her
face
in
her
jeweled
hands
queenie
he
murmured
she
looked
up
at
his
inquiringly
can
you
bear
to
hear
the
circumstances
of
your
poor
sister
death
he
asked
gently
she
bowed
without
speaking
for
answer
he
put
into
her
hand
sydney
dying
deposition
which
lord
valentine
had
returned
to
him
she
read
it
silently
through
it
dropped
from
her
nerveless
clasp
and
she
looked
at
him
with
a
bitter
pain
in
her
white
face
oh
god
my
poor
unhappy
sister
she
moaned
i
have
been
the
cause
of
her
death
say
rather
her
own
reckless
passion
was
her
doom
he
answered
solemnly
do
not
accuse
yourself
queenie
did
not
blame
you
she
was
very
sorrowful
and
repentant
at
the
last
she
wanted
your
forgiveness
oh
my
poor
sydney
she
went
mad
for
love
said
queenie
weeping
as
i
had
almost
done
he
answered
for
queenie
i
have
been
nearly
beside
myself
these
last
few
weeks
i
knew
you
in
spite
of
all
your
denials
and
the
bitterness
of
it
all
nearly
broke
my
heart
but
now
i
shall
have
my
own
again
sydney
wished
it
dearest
he
added
seeing
a
look
of
hesitancy
on
her
face
she
did
not
answer
and
her
blue
eyes
drooped
away
from
his
fond
glance
he
moved
nearer
and
took
her
unresisting
hand
in
his
darling
forgive
me
for
pressing
it
now
in
your
grief
and
trouble
but
tell
me
shall
it
be
as
sydney
wished
will
you
come
back
to
my
heart
perhaps
you
will
not
want
me
when
i
have
told
you
all
i
have
to
tell
she
answered
her
sweet
face
crimson
with
painful
blushes
there
is
nothing
left
for
you
to
tell
my
darling
sydney
has
told
me
all
he
answered
quickly
and
you
do
not
blame
me
you
are
not
angry
with
me
she
said
lifting
her
fair
troubled
face
with
a
look
of
wonder
mingled
with
relief
no
my
sweet
one
how
could
i
blame
you
it
was
like
your
sweet
impulsive
self
he
answered
but
tell
me
now
queenie
if
you
will
but
at
that
moment
the
shrill
scream
of
a
woman
broke
the
silence
of
the
night
and
queenie
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
sob
of
grief
and
terror
it
is
your
mother
dearest
she
is
there
with
sydney
can
you
bear
to
go
to
her
queenie
perhaps
it
may
comfort
her
to
have
one
daughter
restored
to
her
in
the
hour
that
she
has
lost
another
yes
yes
i
will
go
she
moaned
turning
toward
the
door
he
drew
her
hand
into
his
and
led
her
around
to
the
fatal
western
door
lyle
was
there
down
on
her
knees
by
her
dead
daughter
weeping
and
mourning
and
georgina
stood
apart
sobbing
in
her
husband
arms
queenie
rushed
forward
and
threw
herself
down
by
the
side
of
the
kneeling
woman
mamma
mamma
she
sobbed
let
me
comfort
you
a
little
sydney
is
dead
but
queenie
has
come
back
to
you
to
try
to
fill
her
place
lyle
shook
off
the
white
arm
that
had
been
thrown
around
her
neck
and
sprang
to
her
feet
how
dare
you
touch
me
she
cried
you
whose
siren
wiles
have
wrought
my
daughter
death
go
away
from
me
vile
imposter
that
you
are
my
daughter
queenie
is
dead
no
no
mamma
she
lives
she
was
saved
from
death
oh
let
me
tell
you
all
i
am
your
daughter
queenie
cried
the
actress
in
a
voice
of
passionate
pleading
lifting
her
streaming
eyes
to
her
mother
face
begone
you
are
no
child
of
mine
was
the
angry
reply
as
lyle
drew
away
from
her
disdainful
of
her
very
touch
oh
go
go
you
have
stolen
sydney
husband
you
have
caused
her
death
you
can
not
deceive
me
also
will
not
someone
take
her
away
queenie
stood
still
with
clasped
hands
and
streaming
eyes
listening
to
her
mother
cruel
words
then
she
crossed
over
to
lady
valentine
who
stood
within
the
clasp
of
her
husband
arms
weeping
bitterly
georgie
she
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
wo
speak
to
me
do
know
me
sydney
recognized
me
and
owned
me
for
her
sister
even
though
i
stood
in
her
way
surely
you
will
not
disown
me
georgie
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
the
beautiful
pleader
a
moment
in
silence
she
was
not
a
bad
woman
this
lady
valentine
and
for
a
moment
an
impulse
of
pity
stirred
her
heart
and
prompted
her
to
believe
this
strange
story
at
which
her
husband
had
sneered
and
which
her
mother
affected
to
disbelieve
if
she
had
been
left
to
herself
the
better
impulse
in
her
heart
would
have
triumphed
perhaps
even
as
it
was
a
momentary
tender
remembrance
came
into
her
heart
as
she
recalled
the
night
of
her
father
and
sister
death
she
recalled
his
words
georgie
forgive
her
she
was
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
she
went
mad
and
avenged
the
wrong
remember
that
when
she
comes
back
how
did
he
know
she
would
come
back
thought
lady
valentine
to
herself
in
wonder
we
all
thought
she
was
dead
then
but
perhaps
dying
eyes
can
see
more
clearly
than
others
poor
papa
must
i
go
against
his
dying
charge
to
me
then
she
remembered
what
her
husband
had
said
to
her
a
little
while
ago
georgie
do
not
forget
that
you
have
married
into
a
proud
old
family
think
of
the
disgrace
to
us
all
if
you
should
own
this
impostor
for
your
sister
true
she
is
beautiful
and
gifted
but
what
then
she
is
an
the
men
and
women
of
our
race
do
not
descend
to
such
they
amuse
us
on
the
stage
these
clever
people
we
pay
for
our
amusement
and
that
ends
all
we
have
nothing
in
common
do
not
allow
this
clever
deceitful
woman
to
impose
on
you
as
she
did
on
your
lady
valentine
knew
quite
well
what
those
words
meant
she
was
not
to
recognize
the
actress
as
her
sister
no
matter
what
she
thought
so
she
strangled
the
thrill
of
pity
at
her
heart
and
answered
in
a
cold
hard
voice
quite
unlike
her
own
go
away
madame
de
lisle
you
are
no
sister
of
mine
queenie
turned
from
her
with
a
sigh
and
went
back
to
her
mother
mamma
let
me
kiss
you
once
she
said
only
once
dear
mamma
before
i
go
away
i
have
loved
you
so
i
have
hungered
for
you
so
these
long
years
while
i
have
been
away
from
you
let
me
even
kiss
your
hand
mamma
and
i
will
try
to
be
content
oh
surely
you
will
show
me
a
little
kindness
if
only
for
papa
sake
who
loved
me
so
dearly
but
the
mother
heart
was
turned
to
stone
she
thrust
away
the
clinging
hands
she
spurned
the
tender
beseeching
lips
go
away
she
harshly
reiterated
you
are
no
child
of
mine
my
daughter
queenie
is
dead
and
buried
the
discarded
daughter
knelt
down
by
sydney
beautiful
lifeless
clay
and
took
the
cold
hand
in
hers
then
kissed
the
white
breathless
lips
sydney
she
whispered
against
the
icy
cheek
you
were
kinder
to
me
than
they
you
sought
to
kill
my
body
but
they
have
broken
my
heart
she
rose
after
one
long
look
of
grief
and
pain
and
went
back
to
captain
ernscliffe
i
have
only
you
left
lawrence
she
said
mournfully
i
will
be
father
mother
sister
husband
everything
to
you
my
darling
he
answered
fondly
as
he
drew
her
hand
in
his
arm
put
me
in
the
carriage
now
she
said
i
am
very
weary
i
must
go
home
you
will
have
to
be
present
at
the
inquest
did
you
know
that
he
said
yes
i
will
be
there
lawrence
she
said
putting
her
hand
out
from
the
carriage
window
he
clasped
and
kissed
it
then
after
watching
the
carriage
out
of
sight
went
back
to
where
the
mourners
kept
their
weary
vigil
by
the
side
of
the
beautiful
woman
who
had
loved
him
so
fondly
and
fatally
chapter
xxxiii
all
london
rang
with
the
romantic
facts
that
were
elicited
at
the
inquest
over
the
body
of
poor
murdered
sydney
but
though
the
examination
was
conducted
with
the
utmost
strictness
and
every
available
witness
was
interrogated
no
light
was
thrown
upon
the
matter
that
could
lead
to
a
conviction
of
the
murderer
everyone
who
heard
the
tragic
story
of
how
sydney
came
to
her
death
thought
that
madame
reine
de
lisle
evidence
would
certainly
furnish
some
satisfactory
clew
to
the
enemy
who
had
sought
her
life
to
their
surprise
and
consternation
she
declared
herself
utterly
ignorant
in
the
matter
the
note
which
sydney
had
read
was
found
on
the
floor
but
queenie
did
not
recognize
the
writing
and
could
not
guess
the
writer
if
i
had
found
the
note
myself
i
should
have
thought
precisely
as
she
did
that
it
was
written
by
captain
ernscliffe
she
admitted
frankly
but
i
should
not
have
gone
to
meet
him
for
i
had
promised
my
sister
to
avoid
him
and
deny
my
identity
to
him
i
have
not
an
enemy
upon
earth
that
i
am
aware
of
neither
a
jealous
lover
who
might
seek
my
life
i
had
an
enemy
once
who
was
cruel
and
vindictive
enough
for
any
deed
of
darkness
but
he
is
dead
long
ago
they
her
they
tried
to
trip
her
in
every
way
but
she
never
varied
in
her
evidence
and
never
faltered
in
her
reiterated
declarations
so
at
last
they
let
her
go
feeling
convinced
that
nothing
but
the
truth
had
passed
her
lips
so
the
mystery
only
deepened
and
taken
together
with
the
romance
and
pathos
that
clung
about
the
story
of
the
resurrected
wife
and
her
brilliant
career
while
seeking
her
husband
it
created
a
perfect
of
excitement
the
interested
parties
had
tried
to
keep
it
a
secret
but
the
facts
had
leaked
out
in
spite
of
them
everybody
had
heard
that
the
great
actress
was
captain
first
wife
who
had
died
and
been
resurrected
from
the
grave
and
restored
to
life
kept
a
prisoner
for
months
then
escaped
and
been
cared
for
in
her
friendlessness
and
desolation
by
an
old
actor
and
actress
who
had
found
her
dying
in
the
wintery
night
when
she
had
escaped
from
her
cruel
jailers
they
had
taught
her
their
profession
and
she
had
gone
upon
the
stage
to
earn
money
to
seek
her
husband
all
this
the
world
knew
and
it
knew
also
that
the
proud
lady
valentine
and
her
mother
refused
to
recognize
the
actress
and
branded
her
as
a
lying
impostor
all
these
facts
only
added
to
the
interest
and
admiration
that
had
followed
la
reine
blanche
wherever
she
moved
and
poor
sydney
was
laid
away
in
her
grave
while
her
cowardly
murderer
roved
at
large
unwhipped
of
justice
one
single
clew
to
the
criminal
had
been
found
captain
ernscliffe
had
employed
the
most
noted
detective
of
the
day
to
ferret
out
the
mystery
this
man
had
been
thoroughly
over
the
ground
of
the
murder
and
had
found
one
trifling
clew
yet
he
confidently
told
his
employer
that
it
was
an
important
link
in
the
chain
and
might
possibly
convict
the
murderer
it
seemed
a
very
trifling
thing
to
captain
ernscliffe
who
had
not
learned
by
grave
experience
what
simple
things
might
lead
to
great
results
it
was
only
a
woman
handkerchief
of
plain
white
linen
that
he
had
found
outside
the
western
door
wet
and
soiled
where
it
had
lain
on
the
damp
earth
all
night
only
a
woman
handkerchief
but
it
was
marked
in
one
corner
with
a
name
the
simple
name
of
elsie
gray
queenie
started
when
she
heard
what
the
detective
had
said
about
the
handkerchief
she
sent
for
him
immediately
do
you
believe
that
there
was
a
woman
in
complicity
with
the
man
who
murdered
my
unfortunate
sister
she
inquired
madam
i
can
not
tell
you
he
answered
she
may
have
been
in
complicity
with
him
or
she
may
have
been
a
chance
witness
anyhow
i
am
bound
to
find
elsie
gray
i
can
give
you
this
much
information
about
her
was
the
startling
reply
elsie
gray
was
my
maid
and
she
has
been
missing
ever
since
the
hour
of
the
murder
elsie
gray
your
maid
exclaimed
the
detective
that
throws
new
light
on
the
matter
can
you
account
for
her
disappearance
not
at
all
she
was
in
the
habit
of
going
to
the
theater
every
night
with
me
to
help
me
to
change
my
costumes
for
the
different
scenes
she
went
with
me
that
night
but
when
i
went
to
my
room
after
the
first
act
she
was
not
there
i
have
never
seen
her
since
had
she
any
grudge
against
you
none
that
i
am
aware
of
she
was
a
woman
and
appeared
to
be
attached
to
me
the
detective
took
out
pencil
and
paper
will
you
describe
her
appearance
to
me
mrs
ernscliffe
he
said
courteously
queenie
started
and
blushed
at
being
addressed
by
her
husband
name
she
had
not
yet
decided
whether
she
would
return
to
him
again
or
not
but
she
complied
with
the
detective
request
and
minutely
described
her
maid
appearance
he
carefully
noted
it
down
bowed
and
withdrew
he
reported
what
he
had
learned
to
captain
ernscliffe
who
bade
him
go
ahead
and
spare
neither
pains
nor
expense
until
he
had
discovered
the
murderer
in
the
meantime
the
notoriety
of
the
whole
affair
was
very
distressing
to
lyle
and
the
valentines
and
to
queenie
and
lawrence
ernscliffe
as
well
they
could
not
bear
to
remain
in
london
lord
valentine
took
his
wife
and
to
italy
for
an
indefinite
sojourn
lawrence
ernscliffe
begged
his
wife
to
let
him
take
her
back
to
america
to
the
beautiful
home
he
had
prepared
for
her
reception
three
years
before
it
does
not
seem
right
to
return
to
you
and
be
happy
after
after
that
terrible
tragedy
she
objected
queenie
it
was
not
your
fault
nor
mine
surely
you
will
not
doom
me
to
wretchedness
for
such
a
scruple
as
that
you
made
every
sacrifice
she
asked
of
you
while
living
and
she
would
not
wish
you
to
immolate
our
mutual
happiness
upon
her
tomb
now
that
she
is
dead
her
own
heart
seconded
his
pleading
so
fully
that
she
could
not
say
him
nay
i
had
meant
to
fulfill
my
resolve
to
retire
into
a
convent
for
life
she
said
but
i
can
not
keep
down
my
heart
rebellious
throbs
i
will
go
with
you
my
husband
so
it
chanced
that
two
weeks
later
the
husband
and
wife
stood
on
the
deck
of
a
steamer
just
leaving
her
moorings
for
america
and
as
queenie
turned
away
from
her
last
look
at
old
fading
shore
she
saw
a
gentleman
hastening
toward
her
a
gentleman
so
like
her
poor
dead
father
that
her
heart
leaped
into
her
throat
uncle
rob
she
cried
springing
forward
with
her
hands
extended
my
little
niece
queenie
he
exclaimed
taking
the
two
little
hands
warmly
into
his
own
this
is
my
uncle
robert
lyle
she
said
presenting
him
to
her
husband
you
see
lawrence
does
not
disown
me
the
old
gentleman
looked
down
fondly
into
her
sweet
face
oh
how
could
they
disown
you
he
exclaimed
you
have
changed
but
little
since
i
saw
you
last
and
that
change
has
only
made
you
more
lovely
i
should
have
known
you
anywhere
though
it
is
five
years
since
i
saw
you
last
i
have
heard
your
sad
story
my
dear
and
i
do
not
doubt
its
truth
for
an
instant
i
would
have
hastened
to
you
at
once
but
i
was
ill
and
unable
to
travel
she
flashed
a
look
of
silent
gratitude
upon
him
from
her
dusky
eyes
and
by
the
way
he
said
i
owe
you
a
scolding
little
queenie
for
your
failure
to
come
abroad
with
your
mother
and
sisters
four
years
ago
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
me
when
they
came
without
you
i
did
not
enjoy
the
year
we
traveled
together
half
so
well
as
i
should
if
my
little
pet
had
been
with
us
queenie
stood
silent
growing
white
and
red
by
turn
captain
ernscliffe
stared
from
one
to
the
other
in
blank
astonishment
surely
lyle
i
have
misunderstood
your
meaning
he
said
queenie
certainly
went
to
europe
that
year
with
her
mother
and
sisters
chapter
xxxiv
for
a
moment
there
was
a
blank
silence
robert
lyle
stared
silently
at
his
niece
husband
as
though
he
doubted
his
sanity
and
after
a
pause
captain
ernscliffe
gravely
repeated
his
words
surely
i
have
misunderstood
your
meaning
sir
queenie
certainly
went
to
europe
that
year
with
her
mother
and
sisters
if
she
did
i
was
certainly
not
aware
of
the
fact
lyle
answered
dryly
for
he
felt
just
a
little
nettled
at
the
other
persistent
contradiction
captain
ernscliffe
looked
around
at
his
wife
he
started
and
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
as
he
did
so
she
had
fallen
back
against
the
grasping
it
with
both
hands
as
if
unable
to
stand
alone
her
cheeks
and
lips
had
blanched
to
an
ashen
hue
her
eyes
were
wild
and
frightened
queenie
he
said
with
an
unconscious
accent
of
sternness
do
i
speak
the
truth
or
not
lawrence
she
gasped
in
a
frightened
voice
i
thought
you
knew
did
not
sydney
tell
you
you
said
she
had
told
you
i
meant
she
had
told
me
all
that
had
transpired
between
you
two
in
the
last
six
weeks
he
answered
she
did
not
refer
to
the
past
only
to
say
that
you
had
been
resurrected
from
the
grave
by
a
disappointed
suitor
who
hated
you
and
kept
you
for
weary
months
a
prisoner
what
more
is
there
to
tell
queenie
he
inquired
in
a
voice
rendered
sharp
by
suddenly
awakened
suspicion
that
as
yet
took
no
tangible
form
through
the
wild
chaos
of
conflicting
feelings
that
rushed
over
her
she
was
conscious
of
a
new
feeling
of
tenderness
and
respect
for
poor
erring
sydney
she
kept
my
terrible
secret
after
all
she
thought
i
believed
she
had
told
him
everything
but
in
her
desire
to
atone
for
her
cruelty
to
me
she
kept
back
all
that
dreadful
story
and
died
in
the
fond
belief
that
my
happiness
was
secure
she
was
nobler
than
i
thought
but
oh
what
an
awful
position
i
am
placed
in
i
thought
he
knew
all
and
had
forgiven
me
i
meant
to
tell
him
everything
before
i
came
back
to
him
and
would
have
done
it
but
for
that
dreadful
mistake
but
now
oh
how
can
i
uncle
rob
is
right
lawrence
she
said
speaking
with
the
calmness
of
despair
i
did
not
go
to
europe
with
mamma
i
meant
to
go
but
at
the
very
last
my
heart
failed
me
and
i
begged
to
remain
at
home
with
papa
she
gave
me
my
will
though
very
reluctantly
and
i
staid
behind
afterward
i
went
out
of
town
on
a
visit
and
yet
he
said
with
a
heavy
frown
it
was
supposed
you
allowed
everyone
to
believe
that
you
had
been
in
europe
why
was
that
great
crimson
waves
of
color
swept
into
her
cheeks
at
his
words
mamma
permitted
it
she
stammered
she
was
so
angry
and
ashamed
because
i
remained
behind
and
i
was
too
after
i
saw
how
silly
i
had
been
so
when
people
spoke
of
it
we
simply
never
contradicted
it
but
you
may
have
noticed
that
i
would
never
speak
of
that
continental
tour
that
i
always
turned
the
subject
when
anyone
named
it
yes
i
do
remember
that
he
said
but
you
should
at
least
have
told
me
queenie
it
is
very
strange
that
you
made
a
secret
of
such
a
trifle
i
am
very
sorry
she
answered
sadly
i
intended
to
tell
you
about
it
before
before
i
came
back
to
you
but
you
said
when
i
spoke
of
it
that
that
sydney
had
told
you
i
am
very
very
sorry
her
eyes
fell
and
rested
on
the
blue
waves
of
the
ocean
her
head
felt
dizzy
with
the
motion
of
the
ship
and
the
waves
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
could
scarcely
stand
she
seemed
to
be
whirling
round
and
round
lyle
came
forward
and
took
her
hand
my
dear
little
queenie
he
said
i
am
very
sorry
that
my
careless
words
have
exposed
your
foolish
girlish
little
secret
but
forgive
me
my
pet
and
do
not
look
so
sad
captain
ernscliffe
you
must
not
be
angry
with
my
little
girl
she
was
very
willful
and
thoughtless
in
those
days
but
she
has
told
you
she
was
sorry
and
meant
to
tell
you
all
about
it
one
gentle
appealing
look
from
her
blue
eyes
did
more
to
melt
the
heart
of
the
angry
husband
than
all
her
uncle
words
his
moody
brow
unbent
he
came
back
to
her
side
and
as
no
one
was
looking
bent
down
and
kissed
away
the
pearly
tears
that
trembled
on
her
delicate
cheek
there
i
forgive
you
he
said
but
you
must
have
no
more
secrets
from
me
little
one
she
shivered
slightly
but
made
no
answer
and
for
this
one
time
the
threatened
cloud
in
the
sky
of
their
happiness
blew
safely
over
and
all
was
peace
between
them
yet
the
heart
of
the
wife
lay
like
lead
in
her
breast
day
and
night
she
thought
of
the
terrible
secret
she
was
jealously
guarding
from
the
eyes
of
her
husband
but
after
a
calm
and
lovely
voyage
in
which
she
had
been
most
tenderly
cared
for
by
her
uncle
and
her
husband
she
found
herself
once
more
in
the
beautiful
city
where
she
had
been
wooed
and
wedded
uncle
robert
you
will
go
home
with
us
she
said
as
they
were
getting
into
the
carriage
on
the
wharf
not
now
he
answered
you
know
i
told
you
that
it
was
bad
news
regarding
some
of
my
property
here
that
brought
me
over
to
america
i
must
go
to
my
lawyer
at
once
and
see
what
can
be
done
i
will
come
to
you
in
a
day
or
two
and
see
how
you
like
housekeeping
he
added
with
a
laugh
we
shall
certainly
expect
you
answered
captain
ernscliffe
heartily
as
the
carriage
drove
away
to
the
beautiful
mansion
he
had
prepared
for
his
bride
years
ago
a
cablegram
from
england
to
his
housekeeper
had
instructed
her
to
prepare
the
house
for
the
reception
of
himself
and
wife
now
as
they
drew
up
before
the
grand
marble
steps
the
front
door
opened
as
if
by
magic
and
the
cruel
woman
who
had
turned
queenie
away
homeless
and
friendless
years
before
appeared
in
the
hall
richly
clothed
in
fine
black
silk
and
smirking
and
smiling
upon
her
master
and
his
beautiful
bride
as
they
came
up
the
steps
queenie
had
told
him
of
that
cruel
deed
and
he
looked
sternly
and
coldly
upon
the
woman
as
she
came
up
to
them
purdy
he
said
haughtily
this
is
my
wife
look
well
at
her
and
tell
me
if
you
have
ever
met
her
before
the
housekeeper
looked
searchingly
at
the
beautiful
face
whose
blue
eyes
flashed
lightning
scorn
upon
her
in
a
moment
it
all
rushed
over
her
mind
that
face
was
too
lovely
to
be
lightly
forgotten
she
grew
pale
and
commenced
to
stammer
forth
incoherent
apologies
ah
i
see
that
you
remember
me
said
ernscliffe
curling
a
scornful
lip
madam
i
pardon
me
stammered
the
crestfallen
woman
you
were
not
then
his
wife
i
thought
you
a
stranger
a
silence
thundered
captain
ernscliffe
she
was
my
wife
then
as
she
is
now
there
is
no
excuse
for
your
infamous
conduct
she
might
have
died
but
for
the
kindness
of
strangers
she
my
unfortunate
wife
turned
from
her
own
house
without
shelter
for
her
friendless
head
go
now
and
never
let
me
see
you
again
even
as
you
drove
her
out
i
will
drive
you
no
no
exclaimed
queenie
for
she
saw
how
utterly
the
proud
overbearing
woman
was
abashed
no
no
i
was
very
angry
but
i
forgive
her
now
for
i
see
how
she
is
humbled
at
remembrance
of
her
fault
let
her
stay
and
this
incident
may
teach
her
in
future
to
be
guided
by
the
golden
rule
chapter
xxxv
queenie
are
you
ready
for
your
drive
called
her
husband
from
the
foot
of
the
stairway
the
phaeton
is
at
the
door
a
bright
bewitching
face
peeped
down
at
him
from
above
a
face
as
sweet
as
a
rose
with
coral
lips
and
cheeks
and
eyes
as
as
violets
directly
she
came
fluttering
down
the
stairs
and
paused
with
her
slender
hand
upon
his
arm
i
am
ready
she
said
come
lawrence
let
us
go
it
is
too
lovely
a
day
to
remain
indoors
darling
how
lovely
you
are
he
cried
let
me
kiss
you
once
before
we
start
she
smiled
and
linked
her
arm
fondly
in
his
as
they
went
down
the
marble
steps
together
lawrence
she
said
i
almost
begin
to
believe
in
my
happiness
now
at
first
it
seemed
such
a
precious
thing
and
i
held
it
by
so
frail
a
grasp
that
i
feared
i
might
lose
you
again
and
fall
back
into
the
terrible
gulf
of
despair
but
now
months
have
elapsed
and
nothing
has
happened
to
part
us
so
that
it
seems
possible
for
me
to
breathe
freely
and
look
forward
to
a
happy
future
with
you
darling
these
trembling
fears
of
yours
have
always
seemed
strange
and
unnecessary
to
me
what
could
happen
to
part
us
now
he
said
as
he
handed
her
into
the
lovely
little
phaeton
with
its
prancing
gray
ponies
and
sprang
in
beside
her
i
do
not
know
nothing
i
hope
she
answered
with
a
quick
little
sigh
as
she
took
the
reins
into
her
hands
and
touched
up
the
spirited
ponies
where
shall
we
drive
lawrence
in
the
park
yes
if
you
like
he
answered
leaning
back
luxuriously
it
was
a
beautiful
day
in
may
the
air
so
balmy
and
delicious
that
it
was
a
luxury
to
breathe
it
as
they
flashed
along
the
shady
drives
in
the
park
many
eyes
followed
them
admiringly
for
ernscliffe
was
conceded
by
all
to
be
the
fairest
woman
in
the
city
she
wore
a
wonderful
dress
of
mingled
blue
and
and
a
hat
of
azure
satin
with
a
streaming
white
feather
set
coquettishly
on
her
waves
of
golden
hair
the
colors
suited
her
bright
blonde
beauty
exquisitely
her
dark
handsome
dignified
husband
thrilled
with
pleasure
and
pride
as
he
noted
the
many
admiring
glances
that
followed
his
beautiful
and
wife
i
have
had
news
from
england
queenie
he
said
presently
from
england
she
said
and
her
delicate
cheeks
grew
white
oh
lawrence
have
they
found
out
who
murdered
sydney
yet
not
yet
dear
but
the
detective
is
very
hopeful
he
is
on
the
villain
track
who
was
he
what
is
his
name
she
asked
eagerly
i
do
not
know
he
writes
very
meagerly
though
hopefully
he
merely
says
that
he
has
found
your
maid
elsie
gray
and
that
she
has
put
him
on
the
track
of
the
murderer
it
is
not
possible
that
elsie
gray
was
concerned
in
the
murder
of
my
sister
she
exclaimed
oh
no
she
was
a
witness
to
the
deed
only
at
least
i
gather
that
much
from
his
letter
i
think
she
has
been
pursuing
him
ever
since
the
detective
says
that
we
may
expect
startling
developments
soon
god
grant
that
the
cowardly
criminal
may
soon
be
discovered
and
punished
for
his
awful
sin
she
exclaimed
shuddering
queenie
he
said
musingly
have
you
ever
thought
that
but
for
the
sin
of
this
unknown
man
we
should
never
perhaps
have
been
reunited
in
peace
and
happiness
you
might
have
been
in
the
lonely
convent
cell
while
i
perhaps
should
have
raved
in
the
chains
of
a
lunatic
for
queenie
i
was
going
mad
with
the
horror
of
losing
you
again
i
have
thought
of
it
often
she
said
gravely
and
i
have
thought
again
and
again
that
it
was
almost
wrong
to
accept
happiness
that
was
bought
at
so
fearful
a
price
to
my
poor
sydney
her
death
lies
heavy
on
my
heart
queenie
we
both
did
what
we
could
to
insure
her
happiness
while
she
lived
i
married
her
because
one
very
near
to
her
hinted
to
me
that
the
poor
girl
was
dying
of
a
broken
heart
for
my
sake
i
did
not
love
her
but
i
sacrificed
myself
to
save
her
as
you
afterward
sacrificed
us
both
at
her
request
and
yet
those
mutual
bitter
sacrifices
of
ours
availed
very
little
to
secure
the
end
she
sought
i
begin
to
believe
that
such
terrible
are
wrong
and
unjustifiable
and
that
they
never
work
out
good
to
any
it
may
be
true
she
answered
thoughtfully
and
relapsed
into
silence
her
eyes
downcast
her
lips
set
in
a
line
while
she
unconsciously
checked
the
speed
of
the
horses
and
allowed
them
to
walk
slowly
along
the
drive
absorbed
in
thought
she
did
not
observe
a
handsome
man
coming
along
the
toward
them
airily
swinging
a
natty
little
cane
i
hope
and
trust
darling
that
you
will
not
allow
any
weak
and
morbid
fancies
regarding
sydney
to
sadden
and
depress
you
continued
captain
ernscliffe
i
know
she
would
not
wish
it
to
be
so
queenie
looked
up
at
him
gently
with
the
words
of
reply
just
forming
on
her
lips
but
they
died
unspoken
and
she
uttered
a
low
cry
of
fear
and
terror
commingled
while
her
whole
form
trembled
violently
she
had
caught
sight
of
the
man
in
the
road
who
had
just
come
abreast
of
the
phaeton
at
that
moment
the
man
who
had
been
observing
her
for
some
moments
looked
at
her
with
a
sardonic
smile
lifted
his
hat
bowed
deeply
and
murmuring
familiarly
queenie
passed
insolently
on
captain
ernscliffe
grew
ashen
white
something
like
an
imprecation
was
smothered
between
his
lips
good
heaven
queenie
he
exclaimed
is
it
possible
that
you
know
that
man
she
did
not
speak
she
could
not
she
only
stared
at
him
speechlessly
her
lips
parted
in
terror
her
breath
coming
and
going
in
quick
gasps
like
one
dying
do
you
know
who
and
what
that
man
is
he
reiterated
hoarsely
queenie
it
is
leon
vinton
the
most
notorious
gambler
and
in
the
city
and
he
dared
to
speak
to
what
did
he
mean
by
it
you
surely
do
not
know
him
tell
me
still
she
did
not
speak
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
she
had
thought
that
her
enemy
was
dead
had
she
not
seen
him
lying
cold
and
still
with
his
heart
blood
staining
the
snowy
earth
yet
there
he
walked
smiling
evil
triumphant
the
horror
of
the
sight
struck
her
dumb
you
will
not
answer
me
passionately
cried
her
husband
very
well
i
will
wring
the
truth
from
that
insolent
villain
i
will
know
why
he
dared
bow
and
speak
to
wife
drive
on
home
madam
i
will
follow
the
villain
and
make
him
retract
the
insult
he
sprang
from
the
moving
phaeton
at
the
imminent
risk
of
his
neck
and
followed
leon
vinton
with
a
quick
stride
down
the
road
like
one
in
a
fearful
dream
queenie
gathered
the
reins
in
her
trembling
hands
and
drove
recklessly
homeward
through
the
beautiful
sunshine
chapter
xxxvi
the
angry
husband
followed
leon
vinton
leisurely
steps
and
quickly
overtook
him
placing
one
hand
on
the
villain
shoulder
with
a
grasp
like
steel
captain
ernscliffe
whirled
him
round
face
to
face
a
malevolent
sneer
curved
the
lips
of
the
handsome
scoundrel
as
he
recognized
his
assailant
he
tried
to
shake
himself
free
from
that
painfully
tight
grasp
but
it
was
useless
he
seemed
to
be
held
in
a
vise
unhand
me
sir
he
said
in
a
voice
of
angry
expostulation
villain
exclaimed
captain
ernscliffe
in
a
low
deep
voice
of
concentrated
passion
how
dared
you
speak
to
my
wife
apologize
immediately
for
the
insult
leon
vinton
face
assumed
a
blank
stare
of
astonishment
does
consider
it
an
insult
to
be
recognized
by
an
old
friend
he
inquired
in
a
voice
of
mocking
courtesy
captain
ernscliffe
brow
grew
as
dark
as
night
he
shook
the
sneering
scoundrel
by
the
shoulder
as
though
he
would
have
shaken
the
life
out
of
him
how
dare
you
claim
her
as
an
old
friend
he
thundered
you
whose
acquaintance
is
a
disgrace
to
any
woman
you
the
most
notorious
and
unprincipled
villain
in
the
city
retract
those
words
before
i
kill
you
come
come
answered
vinton
coolly
and
maliciously
i
am
but
speaking
the
truth
as
for
killing
let
me
remind
you
that
two
can
play
at
that
game
i
have
a
pistol
in
my
pocket
and
i
believe
i
am
a
better
shot
than
you
are
but
your
wife
as
you
call
her
is
not
worthy
the
shedding
of
an
honest
man
blood
i
will
keep
my
weapon
in
its
place
and
all
i
ask
you
is
to
confront
me
with
the
lady
whose
honor
you
are
so
zealously
defending
i
think
she
will
not
dare
to
deny
that
once
she
claimed
me
as
her
friend
captain
ernscliffe
drew
back
his
hand
to
strike
him
in
the
face
but
something
in
his
enemy
words
and
looks
seemed
to
stagger
him
he
hoarsely
exclaimed
i
will
not
pollute
the
pure
air
she
breathes
with
your
foul
presence
as
for
you
beware
how
you
assert
things
that
you
can
not
prove
hard
words
break
no
bones
laughed
leon
vinton
seeming
to
take
downright
pleasure
in
tormenting
the
other
i
determined
not
to
be
angry
with
you
for
i
do
not
think
the
lady
we
are
discussing
is
worth
the
trouble
i
can
prove
all
that
i
assert
and
more
besides
how
how
exclaimed
ernscliffe
in
sheer
amaze
at
his
unparalleled
effrontery
i
prove
it
by
the
lady
herself
but
since
you
refuse
to
admit
me
to
her
presence
come
with
me
to
my
home
a
few
miles
from
the
city
and
my
housekeeper
shall
show
you
the
elegant
rooms
ernscliffe
occupied
when
she
was
my
dear
friend
and
guest
for
a
year
the
cool
insolent
assertion
fell
on
captain
ernscliffe
ears
like
a
thunderbolt
he
staggered
back
and
stared
at
the
calm
smiling
villain
in
wonder
mingled
with
indefinable
dread
my
god
he
muttered
half
to
himself
you
would
not
make
such
an
assertion
unless
you
could
prove
it
i
can
prove
every
assertion
i
have
made
was
the
confident
reply
queenie
lyle
ran
away
with
me
the
day
her
mother
and
sisters
went
to
europe
she
lived
with
me
nearly
a
year
i
can
prove
this
remember
you
married
her
gasped
his
adversary
his
eyes
starting
his
face
as
white
as
death
leon
vinton
looked
at
that
pale
face
and
laughed
aloud
the
mocking
laugh
of
a
fiend
married
her
he
asked
sneeringly
oh
no
i
am
not
one
of
the
marrying
kind
she
knew
that
but
she
loved
me
and
was
content
to
live
with
me
on
my
own
terms
there
was
a
blank
silence
captain
ernscliffe
dimly
felt
that
the
agony
he
was
enduring
was
commensurate
with
the
pains
of
hell
leon
vinton
enjoyed
his
misery
to
the
utmost
we
lived
together
a
year
he
went
on
after
a
moment
at
first
we
were
very
loving
and
very
happy
but
well
you
know
how
such
cases
always
terminate
we
wearied
of
each
other
she
was
a
and
a
termagant
she
pushed
me
into
the
river
and
tried
to
drown
me
she
thought
she
had
succeeded
and
ran
away
home
her
family
kept
her
fatal
secret
and
married
her
off
to
you
this
is
horrible
if
true
ejaculated
the
listener
come
said
leon
vinton
go
home
with
me
my
carriage
is
outside
the
gate
i
merely
chose
to
saunter
in
the
park
you
shall
see
her
letters
to
me
you
shall
hear
what
my
housekeeper
knows
about
the
matter
i
will
go
with
you
said
captain
ernscliffe
rousing
himself
as
from
a
painful
dream
but
if
i
find
that
you
have
lied
to
me
vinton
i
will
kill
you
chapter
xxxvii
my
poor
queenie
my
poor
child
you
erred
greatly
in
the
deception
you
practiced
in
the
beginning
it
was
wrong
to
desert
your
home
and
family
as
you
did
but
i
can
not
upbraid
you
now
your
punishment
has
been
bitter
enough
may
god
help
you
my
little
one
said
robert
lyle
smoothing
the
golden
head
that
lay
upon
his
knee
with
a
gentle
fatherly
caress
queenie
had
come
back
from
that
ride
which
had
begun
so
happily
and
found
her
uncle
robert
waiting
for
her
in
the
he
had
declined
her
invitation
to
make
his
home
with
her
and
taken
quarters
at
a
hotel
but
there
were
very
few
days
when
he
failed
to
visit
her
when
she
came
staggering
in
looking
so
fearfully
white
and
he
saw
at
once
that
some
fearful
thing
had
happened
to
her
and
started
up
in
alarm
queenie
my
dear
what
is
it
are
you
ill
he
exclaimed
going
to
her
and
taking
her
cold
nerveless
hand
in
his
she
looked
up
at
him
and
robert
lyle
never
forgot
the
tearless
despair
the
utter
agony
of
her
white
face
and
wild
blue
eyes
they
haunted
his
dreams
for
many
nights
after
yet
she
tried
to
smile
and
the
smile
was
sadder
than
tears
i
i
yes
i
believe
i
am
ill
she
said
dropping
down
into
a
great
i
will
sit
here
and
rest
uncle
rob
i
shall
be
better
presently
let
me
get
you
some
wine
he
said
it
will
revive
you
no
no
i
will
not
have
anything
she
said
nothing
could
help
me
the
tone
made
his
heart
ache
it
was
so
hopeless
he
bent
over
her
and
removed
her
hat
and
gloves
as
deftly
and
tenderly
as
a
woman
could
have
done
his
anxious
looks
his
tender
solicitude
made
her
think
of
her
father
the
tender
recollection
broke
down
the
barriers
of
stony
calm
she
was
trying
to
maintain
bowing
her
face
on
her
hands
she
wept
and
sobbed
aloud
lyle
was
greatly
shocked
and
distressed
at
her
vehement
exhibition
of
grief
he
brought
a
chair
and
sitting
down
beside
her
put
his
kindly
old
arm
about
her
heaving
shoulders
tell
your
old
uncle
what
grieves
you
pet
he
said
perhaps
i
can
help
to
set
it
right
and
after
a
little
more
passionate
weeping
she
answered
without
looking
up
it
is
one
of
those
troubles
that
nothing
can
set
right
uncle
rob
but
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
for
perhaps
you
may
hear
it
from
other
lips
than
mine
soon
she
stole
one
hand
into
his
and
nestled
her
bright
head
against
his
shoulder
promise
not
to
hate
me
uncle
rob
she
whispered
through
her
tears
i
have
only
you
now
father
mother
sisters
husband
i
have
lost
them
all
in
all
the
wide
world
i
have
but
you
to
love
me
my
dear
you
talk
wildly
he
said
in
wonder
it
is
true
that
your
mother
and
sister
have
shown
hearts
harder
than
the
nether
to
you
but
you
have
the
noblest
and
most
loving
husband
in
the
world
he
will
not
love
me
any
longer
when
he
has
heard
all
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
uncle
rob
she
murmured
through
her
choking
sobs
and
then
she
told
him
the
shameful
story
of
that
missing
year
of
her
life
as
she
had
told
it
to
sydney
a
few
months
before
but
it
was
not
so
hard
to
tell
now
for
instead
of
her
sister
scornful
looks
and
cruel
words
she
had
a
listener
as
tender
and
pitying
as
her
own
father
had
been
a
listener
whose
tears
fell
more
than
once
on
the
golden
head
bowed
meekly
on
his
shoulder
and
when
it
all
had
been
told
and
the
weary
head
had
slipped
down
to
his
knee
he
had
no
reproaches
for
the
suffering
young
heart
that
had
already
been
so
cruelly
punished
he
could
only
repeat
my
poor
little
one
my
poor
little
one
may
god
help
you
and
you
not
desert
me
uncle
rob
not
even
if
if
does
she
murmured
no
never
he
answered
fondly
i
stand
by
you
queenie
if
all
the
world
forsakes
you
you
never
meant
to
do
wrong
i
know
that
and
i
will
not
scorn
you
because
a
devil
in
human
shape
has
made
desolate
the
fair
young
life
that
opened
with
such
sweet
promise
if
lawrence
deserts
you
we
will
go
away
together
you
and
i
pet
and
wander
around
the
world
restless
and
lonely
and
yet
not
altogether
desolate
for
we
shall
still
have
each
other
for
comfort
and
support
but
oh
uncle
rob
i
love
him
so
i
love
him
so
how
can
i
give
him
up
now
when
i
have
been
so
happy
with
him
it
is
more
than
i
could
bear
he
had
as
well
plunge
a
knife
into
my
heart
and
lay
me
dead
before
him
as
to
leave
me
now
cried
the
wretched
young
wife
giving
way
to
a
very
abandonment
of
grief
uncle
rob
could
only
say
my
poor
queenie
my
poor
darling
let
us
hope
for
the
best
he
did
not
know
how
to
comfort
her
for
he
could
not
tell
what
course
captain
ernscliffe
would
pursue
after
hearing
leon
vinton
garbled
version
of
queenie
early
error
he
hoped
for
the
best
but
he
feared
the
worst
he
could
not
bear
to
leave
her
in
her
sorrow
so
he
remained
with
her
until
the
luncheon
hour
hoping
that
captain
ernscliffe
might
return
while
he
her
uncle
was
present
that
he
might
defend
her
from
his
possible
reproaches
but
the
hours
passed
slowly
by
and
dinner
was
announced
yet
he
failed
to
come
they
made
no
pretence
at
eating
these
two
sorrowing
ones
they
remained
in
the
alone
talking
but
little
and
both
on
the
alert
for
captain
ernscliffe
coming
but
the
lovely
starry
night
had
fallen
and
the
lamps
were
lighted
before
a
strange
step
ran
up
the
marble
steps
and
a
letter
was
handed
to
queenie
it
is
from
lawrence
she
said
tearing
it
open
with
a
sinking
heart
madam
her
husband
wrote
i
have
heard
the
whole
disgraceful
story
of
the
year
you
were
supposed
to
have
been
absent
in
europe
from
the
lips
of
leon
vinton
and
his
housekeeper
i
need
not
ask
you
if
he
told
the
truth
your
looks
when
you
met
him
were
sufficient
corroboration
of
his
story
no
wonder
you
looked
so
ghastly
at
the
reappearance
of
the
man
you
thought
you
had
murdered
oh
god
to
think
of
it
you
whom
i
have
loved
so
madly
whom
i
thought
so
true
and
pure
you
a
sinner
with
a
soul
as
black
and
unrepentant
as
a
fiend
in
hades
i
shall
institute
proceedings
for
a
divorce
i
can
no
longer
lend
the
shelter
of
my
name
to
one
who
has
so
basely
deceived
and
betrayed
me
chapter
xxxviii
the
letter
dropped
from
queenie
shaking
hand
and
she
fell
heavily
into
a
seat
her
slender
form
trembling
with
great
tearless
emotion
oh
god
she
moaned
it
is
indeed
a
bitter
cup
that
is
pressed
to
my
lips
a
disowned
daughter
and
sister
and
a
divorced
wife
what
does
he
say
queenie
inquired
her
uncle
pausing
in
his
weary
march
up
and
down
the
room
she
silently
pointed
to
the
letter
that
lay
upon
the
carpet
where
it
had
fallen
from
her
hands
he
picked
it
up
and
read
it
then
turned
his
kindly
blue
eyes
upon
her
with
an
expression
of
pity
and
distress
the
scoundrel
vinton
must
indeed
have
traduced
and
maligned
you
to
have
elicited
such
a
scathing
letter
from
your
devoted
husband
let
me
go
and
bring
lawrence
to
you
queenie
that
you
may
vindicate
yourself
but
she
shook
her
head
sorrowfully
yet
firmly
no
uncle
rob
he
asks
for
no
defense
from
me
he
tacitly
accepts
all
that
vinton
has
told
him
as
the
truth
he
will
hear
nothing
from
you
or
me
there
is
nothing
left
me
but
to
hide
myself
somewhere
in
the
great
cruel
world
and
die
she
said
with
inexpressible
bitterness
queenie
let
me
entreat
you
not
to
throw
away
your
happiness
thus
let
me
explain
everything
to
lawrence
as
you
have
told
it
to
me
he
could
not
be
hard
upon
you
then
he
would
see
how
cruelly
you
had
been
wronged
and
how
much
you
had
suffered
for
it
if
he
loves
you
as
much
as
he
has
seemed
to
do
he
could
not
but
forgive
you
she
took
the
letter
from
his
hand
and
glanced
over
its
brief
contents
again
no
no
his
love
must
have
been
dead
indeed
before
he
could
write
to
me
so
cruelly
as
this
let
him
think
what
he
will
uncle
rob
the
best
is
bad
enough
so
why
should
i
try
to
vindicate
myself
he
shall
have
his
freedom
since
he
wants
it
so
much
but
my
dear
surely
you
will
not
permit
the
divorce
without
contesting
it
think
what
a
terrible
thing
it
would
be
to
remain
silent
in
such
a
case
a
divorced
woman
is
always
a
disgraced
woman
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
no
matter
how
unjustly
the
verdict
was
given
against
her
it
must
not
be
permitted
we
must
engage
a
lawyer
to
defend
your
case
i
do
not
believe
that
your
husband
could
obtain
a
divorce
from
any
court
in
the
land
if
the
truth
of
the
matter
were
rightly
known
do
you
think
that
i
would
belong
to
him
and
bear
his
name
against
his
will
she
exclaimed
with
all
the
passion
and
fire
of
tone
and
gesture
that
had
won
her
fame
and
fortune
on
the
tragic
stage
no
never
i
will
not
raise
my
hand
to
stay
the
divorce
i
will
be
silent
whatever
they
lay
to
my
charge
his
quick
unkindness
his
readiness
to
believe
evil
against
me
has
been
the
bitterest
of
all
to
bear
but
i
will
not
speak
one
word
to
let
him
know
it
my
heart
shall
break
in
silence
he
gave
up
the
point
seeing
that
it
was
utterly
useless
to
urge
it
upon
her
since
you
are
determined
to
sacrifice
yourself
thus
on
the
altar
of
vinton
fiendish
revenge
he
said
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
my
poor
child
you
will
not
wish
to
remain
at
ernscliffe
house
of
course
of
course
not
she
answered
then
after
a
moment
thought
she
said
abruptly
why
uncle
rob
i
shall
have
to
go
upon
the
stage
again
i
had
forgotten
until
this
moment
that
i
am
poor
that
i
have
nothing
at
all
to
live
upon
when
i
gave
up
my
theatrical
career
and
returned
to
my
husband
i
deeded
away
with
his
consent
all
my
earnings
on
the
stage
to
build
a
free
church
for
the
poor
of
london
you
shall
never
go
upon
the
stage
again
with
my
consent
he
answered
i
have
enough
for
us
both
to
live
in
luxury
all
our
lives
it
is
true
i
have
lost
a
few
thousands
recently
by
the
failure
of
a
bank
but
that
is
a
mere
nothing
i
am
a
very
wealthy
man
yet
you
shall
be
my
dear
and
honored
daughter
so
long
as
i
live
queenie
and
my
heiress
when
i
die
she
thanked
him
with
a
silent
eloquent
glance
and
now
he
continued
it
will
not
do
for
you
to
remain
in
ernscliffe
house
any
longer
than
let
your
maid
pack
your
trunks
for
you
and
i
will
take
you
away
to
some
health
resort
the
mountains
or
the
seashore
anywhere
you
like
so
that
i
get
you
out
of
this
city
and
i
shall
never
see
my
husband
again
she
said
clasping
her
hands
with
a
gesture
of
despair
oh
how
fleeting
and
evanescent
was
my
dream
of
happiness
how
can
i
live
without
him
now
when
i
have
been
so
happy
with
him
uncle
robert
took
her
tenderly
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
white
forehead
it
is
hard
dear
he
said
but
we
learn
after
awhile
to
do
without
the
things
that
have
been
dearest
to
us
on
earth
i
lost
the
darling
of
my
heart
many
years
ago
it
was
very
hard
to
bear
at
first
but
after
awhile
i
learned
patience
and
resignation
you
have
loved
and
lost
she
said
looking
at
him
in
great
surprise
yes
pet
did
you
think
i
was
a
crusty
forlorn
old
bachelor
from
choice
no
no
i
was
betrothed
to
a
sweet
and
lovely
girl
in
my
early
youth
but
she
went
away
to
live
with
the
angels
and
i
have
been
true
to
her
memory
ever
since
poor
uncle
i
did
not
know
you
had
so
sad
a
secret
in
your
life
she
said
with
the
dew
of
sympathy
shining
in
her
beautiful
blue
eyes
every
heart
knoweth
its
own
bitterness
answered
the
kind
old
man
sadly
the
next
day
he
took
her
away
to
the
seashore
hoping
that
the
change
of
air
and
scene
might
divert
her
mind
from
its
sorrows
it
was
a
vain
hope
her
terrible
trouble
was
too
deeply
graven
on
her
mind
she
became
ill
the
day
they
took
possession
of
their
cottage
and
for
several
weeks
lay
tossing
with
fever
closely
attended
by
a
skillful
physician
and
two
careful
old
nurses
while
lyle
veered
to
and
fro
his
gentle
heart
nearly
broken
by
this
unexpected
stroke
of
fate
but
at
length
when
they
had
almost
begun
to
despair
of
her
recovery
her
illness
took
a
sudden
turn
for
the
better
she
began
to
convalesce
slowly
but
surely
and
one
day
she
turned
the
nurses
out
of
the
room
and
sent
for
her
uncle
robert
i
want
to
ask
you
something
she
said
putting
her
feverish
wasted
little
hand
into
his
strong
tender
clasp
i
am
listening
dear
he
answered
kindly
has
has
that
divorce
been
granted
yet
she
inquired
flushing
slightly
oh
no
my
dear
your
husband
has
applied
for
it
but
they
have
been
waiting
since
your
illness
to
know
what
steps
you
will
take
in
the
matter
whether
or
not
you
would
engage
a
lawyer
and
contest
the
divorce
i
would
not
give
them
any
satisfaction
while
you
were
sick
for
i
thought
you
might
change
your
mind
i
changed
my
mind
uncle
rob
she
said
i
mean
to
contest
the
divorce
there
is
a
reason
now
she
blushed
and
drooped
her
eyes
from
his
perplexed
gaze
why
i
should
try
to
save
my
fair
fame
as
much
as
i
can
not
that
i
wish
to
live
with
lawrence
again
whether
there
is
a
divorce
or
not
but
i
wish
to
defend
my
own
honor
and
leave
behind
me
as
pure
a
name
as
i
can
you
will
secure
an
able
lawyer
for
me
will
you
not
uncle
robbie
yes
darling
you
shall
have
the
best
counsel
that
money
can
procure
he
answered
deeply
moved
at
her
earnest
words
chapter
xxxix
captain
ernscliffe
sat
alone
in
the
spacious
library
of
his
elegant
mansion
the
windows
were
raised
and
the
rich
curtains
of
silk
and
lace
were
drawn
back
admitting
the
bracing
october
air
the
playful
breeze
lifted
the
dark
clustering
locks
from
his
high
white
brow
and
wafted
to
his
senses
the
delicate
perfume
of
roses
and
lilies
that
filled
the
vases
on
the
marble
mantel
the
evening
sunshine
lay
in
great
golden
bars
on
the
carpet
but
none
of
these
beautiful
things
attracted
the
attention
of
the
master
of
this
luxurious
mansion
he
sat
at
his
desk
with
an
open
book
before
him
and
a
cigar
between
his
white
aristocratic
fingers
but
the
fire
had
died
out
on
the
tip
of
his
prime
havana
and
the
idle
breeze
turned
the
leaves
of
his
book
at
its
wanton
will
he
sat
there
perfectly
still
and
silent
in
his
great
staring
drearily
before
him
a
stern
sad
look
on
his
handsome
face
the
fire
of
a
jealous
passion
smouldering
gloomily
in
the
beautiful
dark
eyes
half
veiled
by
their
sweeping
lashes
he
had
been
trying
to
read
but
the
strange
unrest
that
possessed
him
was
too
great
to
admit
of
fixing
his
attention
on
the
author
yet
now
he
slowly
repeated
some
lines
that
caught
his
eye
as
the
light
breeze
fluttered
the
book
leaves
falser
than
all
fancy
fathoms
falser
than
all
songs
have
sung
ah
she
is
all
that
and
more
he
exclaimed
bitterly
showing
by
those
quick
words
where
his
thoughts
were
a
slight
cough
interrupted
him
he
looked
up
quickly
and
saw
robert
lyle
standing
within
the
door
the
old
man
moved
forward
deprecatingly
pardon
my
abrupt
entrance
captain
ernscliffe
he
said
i
knocked
several
times
without
eliciting
a
reply
so
i
ventured
to
enter
through
the
door
captain
ernscliffe
arose
and
shook
his
visitor
hand
with
a
cordiality
tempered
by
an
indefinable
restraint
pray
make
no
apologies
sir
he
said
they
are
quite
unnecessary
he
placed
a
chair
for
the
visitor
then
resumed
his
own
seat
gazing
rather
curiously
at
the
kindly
old
gentleman
who
reminded
him
so
much
of
his
wife
father
what
had
brought
him
there
he
wondered
with
some
slight
nervousness
at
the
thought
lyle
looked
a
little
nervous
too
he
wiped
the
dew
from
his
fine
old
forehead
and
remarked
that
it
was
a
warm
day
i
suppose
so
assented
the
host
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
say
he
had
not
thought
about
it
before
i
have
come
on
a
thankless
mission
lawrence
lyle
said
with
some
slight
embarrassment
at
least
on
an
unsolicited
one
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
of
of
queenie
captain
ernscliffe
flushed
crimson
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
then
grew
deathly
pale
i
must
refer
you
to
my
counsel
then
he
answered
after
a
pause
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
her
myself
lawrence
the
gently
rebuking
tone
in
which
the
one
word
was
uttered
made
the
hearer
start
he
looked
up
quickly
well
sir
do
you
know
that
you
are
treating
my
niece
very
unfairly
in
this
matter
it
is
cruel
to
condemn
her
with
her
defense
unheard
she
condemned
herself
lyle
without
a
word
from
anyone
else
her
guilt
and
shame
were
written
all
too
legibly
on
her
face
the
moment
she
looked
upon
leon
vinton
let
us
grant
that
she
had
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
his
acquaintance
lawrence
still
may
there
not
be
some
extenuation
for
her
fault
none
none
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
blacker
her
dreadful
sins
appear
oh
my
god
to
think
of
her
with
her
face
as
lovely
as
an
angel
and
her
heart
all
black
with
sin
to
think
how
i
trusted
and
loved
her
and
how
basely
she
repaid
my
confidence
how
cruelly
she
deceived
and
betrayed
me
exclaimed
the
outraged
husband
rising
from
his
seat
and
pacing
the
floor
excitedly
i
can
not
effect
any
compromise
then
said
lyle
irresolutely
you
are
bent
on
a
divorce
i
suppose
a
separation
would
not
content
you
did
send
you
to
ask
this
angrily
exclaimed
captain
ernscliffe
pausing
in
his
restless
tramp
to
glare
furiously
at
the
peacemaker
no
lawrence
i
told
you
i
came
on
an
unsolicited
mission
queenie
knows
nothing
of
my
coming
and
would
not
thank
me
for
having
asked
that
useless
question
she
asks
no
favors
from
you
but
she
means
to
defend
her
honor
and
fight
the
divorce
which
would
brand
her
with
shame
my
counsel
and
hers
will
settle
that
affair
in
the
meantime
why
this
useless
dallying
for
long
months
on
the
pretence
of
illness
why
does
she
shirk
appearing
at
court
in
answer
to
the
summons
if
not
guilty
why
does
she
not
hasten
to
protest
her
innocence
queenie
is
ill
captain
ernscliffe
has
been
ill
for
months
but
we
hope
now
that
she
may
soon
be
able
to
appear
at
court
and
confront
her
accusers
why
does
she
not
instruct
her
lawyer
to
manage
the
case
without
her
if
she
is
unable
to
be
present
herself
this
suspense
is
unendurable
if
this
delay
is
continued
much
longer
i
shall
endeavor
to
push
the
matter
without
her
i
am
tired
of
this
they
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
in
silence
then
the
elder
man
said
with
a
repressed
sigh
that
is
one
thing
i
came
to
ask
you
lawrence
grant
us
this
much
grace
my
poor
unfortunate
queenie
and
her
fond
old
uncle
do
not
push
the
matter
for
a
little
while
wait
until
she
can
come
into
court
and
tell
her
own
story
before
her
fiendish
accusers
but
lyle
i
am
growing
too
impatient
to
wait
longer
i
chafe
at
the
bonds
that
bind
me
to
that
beautiful
deceiver
they
will
not
bind
you
much
longer
lyle
answered
sadly
either
death
or
the
law
will
soon
sever
your
hated
fetters
captain
ernscliffe
started
and
looked
at
the
speaker
wildly
death
he
said
with
an
uncontrollable
shudder
why
do
you
talk
of
death
what
is
this
mysterious
illness
that
has
held
her
in
its
chains
so
long
she
used
to
be
strong
and
well
she
never
talked
of
weakness
i
can
not
tell
what
ails
her
lawrence
said
lyle
rising
as
if
the
conference
were
ended
but
i
have
the
word
of
her
physician
to
tell
you
that
within
a
month
she
will
either
be
able
to
appear
in
court
and
do
what
is
necessary
to
defend
her
rights
or
she
will
be
in
her
grave
in
either
case
you
will
be
free
the
words
fell
coldly
on
lawrence
ernscliffe
hearing
chilling
the
hot
and
passionate
tide
of
resentment
that
hurried
through
his
heart
he
thought
with
an
uncontrollable
pang
of
all
that
bright
fair
beauty
he
had
loved
so
long
and
so
fondly
lying
cold
in
the
grave
those
lips
that
had
kissed
him
so
tenderly
sealed
in
death
the
white
lids
shut
forever
over
the
heaven
of
love
in
those
soft
blue
eyes
will
that
content
you
lawrence
asked
the
old
man
wistfully
pausing
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
a
month
is
not
so
very
long
that
depends
on
the
mood
one
is
in
was
the
unsatisfactory
reply
but
you
will
wait
lyle
said
almost
pleadingly
there
was
a
minute
pause
and
then
the
answer
came
coldly
i
will
wait
thanks
and
farewell
said
lyle
passing
silently
out
of
the
room
the
outraged
husband
was
alone
once
more
the
red
glow
of
the
sunset
shining
into
the
room
and
touching
with
its
tender
warmth
his
pallid
features
he
could
not
rest
lyle
words
in
his
ears
turning
his
warm
blood
to
an
icy
current
that
flowed
sluggishly
through
his
benumbed
veins
in
a
month
she
may
be
in
her
grave
oh
the
horror
of
that
thought
he
said
aloud
yes
it
was
horror
he
thought
he
hated
her
she
had
deceived
him
so
bitterly
he
thought
he
was
anxious
to
sever
the
tie
that
bound
them
together
he
thought
he
never
wished
to
look
upon
her
beautiful
false
face
again
and
yet
and
yet
those
words
of
lyle
staggered
him
he
reeled
beneath
the
suddenness
of
the
blow
he
asked
himself
again
as
he
had
asked
lyle
what
is
this
mysterious
illness
that
holds
her
in
its
chains
he
did
not
know
he
did
not
dream
of
the
truth
if
he
had
known
it
he
must
surely
have
forgiven
her
and
taken
her
back
he
could
not
have
hated
her
longer
even
though
she
had
sinned
and
deceived
him
for
he
had
loved
her
very
dearly
and
she
was
his
wife
but
he
said
to
himself
why
should
i
care
if
she
dies
she
deceived
me
shamefully
she
can
never
be
anything
to
me
again
in
either
case
as
that
old
man
said
i
shall
be
free
what
will
it
matter
to
me
then
if
she
be
dead
or
alive
i
shall
never
see
her
again
and
then
when
he
began
to
understand
that
she
might
die
before
her
testimony
was
given
before
the
court
in
her
own
defense
he
became
conscious
of
a
vague
feeling
of
disappointment
he
knew
now
that
he
had
been
very
anxious
all
along
to
hear
what
his
wife
would
say
when
she
stood
face
to
face
with
her
accuser
perhaps
after
all
she
could
vindicate
herself
if
not
why
was
she
so
anxious
to
make
the
attempt
have
i
wronged
her
he
asked
himself
suddenly
should
i
have
condemned
her
without
hearing
her
version
of
that
villain
story
ah
he
would
not
have
dared
deceive
me
chapter
xl
suddenly
a
entered
with
a
card
in
his
hand
a
gentleman
to
see
you
sir
he
said
captain
ernscliffe
took
the
bit
of
pasteboard
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
it
he
started
with
surprise
as
he
did
so
kidder
was
the
name
he
read
it
was
the
famous
london
detective
whom
he
had
employed
to
hunt
down
sydney
dastardly
murderer
what
is
he
doing
here
in
america
in
this
city
thought
captain
ernscliffe
in
surprise
show
the
gentleman
into
this
room
he
said
to
the
man
kidder
came
briskly
in
a
moment
after
he
was
a
little
man
and
gentlemanly
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
here
he
said
after
they
had
exchanged
the
usual
greetings
yes
admitted
the
host
do
you
bring
news
the
little
man
black
eyes
sparkled
the
best
of
news
he
answered
blithely
i
have
run
the
game
down
that
is
indeed
the
best
of
news
said
his
employer
his
face
lighting
up
but
i
do
quite
understand
why
you
are
here
in
the
united
states
you
do
said
kidder
with
a
laugh
well
i
am
here
because
my
man
is
here
i
have
followed
him
across
the
seas
is
it
possible
exclaimed
the
listener
with
a
start
yes
it
is
true
i
have
had
a
weary
hunt
for
him
but
i
have
unearthed
him
at
last
thanks
to
elsie
gray
elsie
gray
ah
yes
i
remember
she
was
my
wife
maid
who
disappeared
so
strangely
the
night
of
the
murder
you
say
she
helped
you
where
is
she
now
she
crossed
the
ocean
with
me
she
is
here
in
this
city
and
will
be
the
chief
witness
in
the
prosecution
she
witnessed
the
murder
and
recognized
the
criminal
at
that
moment
as
a
former
lover
of
your
present
wife
she
pursued
him
and
was
on
his
track
when
i
found
her
it
has
been
almost
a
year
since
that
dreadful
night
said
captain
ernscliffe
he
must
have
been
very
clever
to
evade
justice
so
long
he
was
a
cunning
accomplished
villain
said
kidder
i
followed
him
for
weary
months
but
he
managed
to
elude
me
every
time
when
i
began
to
think
i
had
run
him
to
earth
i
lost
him
altogether
for
awhile
and
then
i
discovered
that
he
had
left
the
country
and
sailed
for
the
united
states
i
at
once
secured
my
witness
elsie
gray
and
followed
him
but
he
may
elude
you
here
as
he
did
in
europe
said
captain
ernscliffe
looking
disappointed
it
is
not
at
all
likely
said
kidder
laughing
for
i
have
already
had
him
arrested
and
lodged
in
prison
no
do
not
thank
me
he
added
as
his
employer
poured
out
a
torrent
of
praises
and
thanks
rather
thank
elsie
gray
but
for
her
indefatigable
exertions
and
the
valuable
information
she
gave
me
i
might
never
have
succeeded
in
my
undertaking
she
shall
have
my
thanks
and
something
more
substantial
beside
the
reward
shall
be
doubled
and
she
shall
share
it
equally
she
has
already
promised
to
go
shares
with
me
said
the
detective
so
significantly
and
demurely
that
captain
ernscliffe
could
not
fail
to
understand
his
meaning
so
she
will
marry
you
he
said
smiling
and
then
gazing
curiously
at
the
happy
little
man
who
was
not
more
than
thirty
years
old
he
added
pardon
me
but
you
are
quite
young
and
ernscliffe
maid
was
quite
was
she
not
oh
no
she
was
quite
young
and
pretty
said
the
detective
laughing
his
happy
laugh
but
surely
began
the
listener
ernscliffe
maid
was
in
disguise
both
as
to
name
and
appearance
said
kidder
interrupting
him
perhaps
a
bit
of
her
history
might
interest
you
sir
seeing
that
she
has
served
you
a
good
turn
i
should
like
to
hear
it
said
captain
ernscliffe
but
wait
a
moment
kidder
until
i
ring
for
lights
it
is
growing
dark
when
the
gas
was
lighted
and
the
curtains
dropped
over
the
windows
he
turned
back
to
his
visitor
and
said
go
on
kidder
let
me
hear
elsie
gray
history
well
sir
elsie
gray
true
name
is
jennie
thorn
and
she
is
not
more
than
twenty
years
old
she
was
a
poor
farmer
daughter
when
this
man
whom
she
has
tracked
to
his
doom
deceived
and
ruined
her
under
a
pretense
of
marriage
the
poor
girl
went
home
to
her
parents
but
her
honest
father
drove
her
away
with
curses
when
he
discovered
her
condition
and
learned
her
sad
story
her
mother
secretly
befriended
her
and
found
her
a
place
to
stay
in
hiding
until
her
child
was
born
fortunately
for
the
poor
girl
it
was
born
dead
and
then
she
set
out
upon
a
mission
which
she
had
sworn
to
accomplish
her
revenge
upon
the
man
who
had
betrayed
her
in
the
meanwhile
her
enraged
father
had
shot
the
deceiver
and
thinking
him
dead
had
fled
the
country
but
the
wicked
deceiver
was
proof
against
his
enemy
bullet
he
was
born
to
be
hung
you
see
sir
and
he
was
proof
against
anything
else
so
he
got
well
and
was
clear
out
of
the
country
before
poor
jennie
was
on
her
feet
again
she
was
sorely
disappointed
but
she
bided
her
time
captain
ernscliffe
began
to
look
as
if
he
took
an
interest
in
the
history
of
the
farmer
pretty
daughter
she
sought
for
him
everywhere
as
far
as
her
money
would
carry
her
went
on
the
detective
but
she
never
saw
or
heard
of
her
enemy
at
length
her
mother
came
to
the
city
with
her
and
together
they
continued
their
unrelenting
quest
for
they
both
had
sworn
to
take
a
terrible
revenge
upon
the
destroyer
of
innocence
he
paused
a
moment
and
captain
ernscliffe
half
forgetful
of
his
own
troubles
in
this
sorrowful
story
exclaimed
go
on
kidder
i
am
very
much
interested
in
jennie
thorn
sad
story
one
night
they
went
to
the
theater
continued
the
detective
and
there
they
saw
upon
the
stage
the
beautiful
lady
that
is
now
your
wife
ah
exclaimed
captain
ernscliffe
with
a
start
yes
sir
you
begin
to
get
an
inkling
of
things
now
said
kidder
well
to
go
on
jennie
thorn
recognized
the
lady
she
had
seen
her
before
and
knew
that
the
man
who
had
wronged
her
was
an
enemy
of
madame
de
lisle
she
knew
that
they
hated
each
other
and
that
he
had
sworn
to
take
a
terrible
revenge
upon
her
well
sir
in
that
minute
jennie
thorn
began
to
see
what
would
be
her
own
best
chance
to
find
her
betrayer
again
captain
ernscliffe
was
growing
too
excited
to
keep
his
seat
he
rose
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
his
arms
folded
over
his
broad
breast
his
burning
gaze
fixed
on
the
detective
shrewd
intelligent
face
she
knew
that
the
man
would
follow
madame
de
lisle
like
her
evil
genius
and
she
determined
to
keep
near
the
beautiful
actress
the
next
day
she
disguised
herself
as
an
elderly
woman
changed
her
name
and
went
into
your
wife
service
as
her
maid
captain
ernscliffe
gazed
at
him
silently
he
began
to
comprehend
now
there
little
more
to
tell
sir
jennie
left
her
mother
in
the
united
states
and
followed
madame
de
lisle
across
the
ocean
at
first
the
actress
had
an
old
couple
of
actors
with
her
the
same
that
adopted
her
and
taught
her
their
profession
but
they
both
died
the
old
man
sickened
first
and
died
and
his
wife
soon
followed
him
to
the
grave
then
the
actress
grew
attached
to
jennie
and
would
not
have
parted
with
her
for
anything
her
appearance
was
a
protection
to
the
young
lady
who
was
so
beautiful
and
so
lonely
and
she
never
suspected
that
her
elderly
maid
was
other
than
what
she
seemed
jennie
was
contented
to
remain
with
her
but
though
she
followed
her
like
a
shadow
she
never
saw
her
base
betrayer
until
the
night
of
the
murder
that
night
a
small
boy
came
to
the
with
that
fatal
letter
it
was
so
unusual
an
occurrence
that
jennie
stealthily
followed
him
out
and
saw
where
he
had
gone
hidden
behind
the
curtains
of
a
window
she
watched
the
man
outside
the
western
door
almost
at
the
moment
that
she
recognized
him
she
saw
him
spring
to
the
door
she
parted
the
curtains
and
saw
the
steel
flashing
in
his
hand
to
be
buried
the
next
moment
in
the
heart
of
the
woman
coming
up
to
him
he
paused
a
moment
at
captain
ernscliffe
hollow
groan
then
continued
jennie
told
me
that
the
wild
scream
of
anguish
that
rose
the
next
moment
nearly
broke
her
heart
she
thought
it
was
her
dear
kind
mistress
whom
he
had
killed
and
she
was
filled
with
the
fury
of
the
tigress
she
sprang
over
the
fallen
body
and
followed
the
murderer
who
was
hurrying
away
she
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
fastened
her
teeth
in
his
arm
he
shook
her
off
and
ran
away
she
sprang
after
him
she
followed
him
to
a
house
but
he
escaped
from
it
or
eluded
her
somehow
and
she
took
quarters
in
the
vicinity
and
was
watching
the
place
when
i
found
her
with
the
information
she
gave
me
i
succeeded
in
tracing
him
further
and
finally
we
tracked
him
down
he
is
at
this
moment
in
prison
and
if
he
gets
his
dues
he
will
swing
from
the
gallows
right
speedily
a
villain
never
walked
upon
the
earth
there
was
silence
for
a
time
and
then
the
detective
added
when
i
landed
herein
this
city
with
jennie
in
my
charge
we
found
that
her
mother
was
dead
the
poor
girl
has
not
a
friend
on
earth
and
she
has
promised
to
marry
me
and
after
the
trial
is
over
she
will
return
to
england
with
me
she
is
a
good
sweet
true
girl
and
i
do
bear
any
grudge
against
her
because
she
has
suffered
from
the
arts
of
a
villain
through
her
too
confiding
innocence
you
have
my
congratulations
my
fine
fellow
said
captain
ernscliffe
heartily
but
do
you
know
that
you
have
forgotten
to
tell
me
the
name
of
the
man
who
murdered
my
poor
sydney
why
really
have
i
neglected
to
mention
his
name
you
must
excuse
me
captain
ernscliffe
for
it
is
one
of
the
traits
of
my
profession
to
be
chary
of
mentioning
names
the
man
belongs
right
here
in
this
city
and
is
a
notorious
gambler
and
rogue
he
is
as
handsome
as
a
prince
as
wicked
as
the
devil
and
his
name
is
leon
vinton
chapter
xli
if
there
be
any
whom
you
have
not
yet
forgiven
if
there
be
any
wrong
you
yet
may
right
let
not
the
sun
go
down
upon
your
wrath
my
son
for
verily
you
must
forgive
as
you
would
be
forgiven
upon
no
less
terms
than
these
can
you
win
the
pardon
and
absolution
of
heaven
it
was
the
voice
of
the
solemn
priest
and
he
stood
in
the
gloomy
cell
of
a
convicted
murderer
who
before
the
sunset
of
another
day
was
to
expiate
his
terrible
sin
by
a
felon
death
even
now
from
the
gloomy
outside
could
be
heard
the
awful
sound
of
the
hammers
driving
the
nails
into
his
scaffold
upon
the
low
cot
bed
reclined
the
handsome
demon
whom
we
have
known
in
our
story
as
leon
vinton
wasted
and
worn
in
his
coarse
prison
garb
and
clanking
fetters
there
was
still
much
of
that
princely
beauty
left
that
had
lured
youth
and
innocence
to
their
deadly
ruin
but
the
reckless
satanic
smile
was
gone
from
his
pallid
features
now
and
a
glance
of
anguished
terror
and
dread
shone
forth
from
his
hollow
black
eyes
like
many
another
wretched
sinner
in
his
dying
hour
leon
vinton
was
afraid
of
the
vengeance
of
that
god
whom
he
had
despised
and
defied
all
his
wicked
life
all
day
the
priests
had
been
with
him
praying
chanting
exhorting
and
now
the
chilly
gloomy
december
day
was
fading
to
its
close
and
the
long
dreary
night
hurried
on
his
last
night
upon
the
beautiful
earth
through
which
he
had
walked
as
a
destroying
demon
scattering
the
of
ruin
and
remorse
along
his
evil
pathway
and
now
he
feels
and
yet
shall
know
in
realms
where
guilt
shall
end
no
gloom
the
perils
of
inflicted
woe
the
anguish
of
the
liar
doom
he
hears
a
voice
none
else
may
hear
it
bids
his
burning
spirit
pause
it
bids
thee
murderer
appear
where
angels
plead
the
victim
cause
almost
a
year
had
passed
since
the
tragic
death
of
unhappy
sydney
lyle
now
outraged
justice
was
about
to
avenge
her
death
conviction
had
followed
swiftly
upon
the
murderer
arrest
and
imprisonment
when
he
had
left
poor
jennie
thorn
his
betrayed
and
ruined
victim
fainting
upon
the
floor
with
his
demoniacal
words
ringing
in
her
ears
he
had
little
dreamed
how
and
when
he
should
meet
her
again
perhaps
he
thought
she
would
pass
silently
from
his
life
as
other
wronged
ones
had
done
and
never
be
seen
or
heard
of
again
not
the
slightest
premonition
of
evil
had
come
to
tell
him
that
the
hatred
he
had
stirred
to
life
in
her
once
loving
heart
would
pursue
him
to
the
scaffold
yet
so
it
was
and
jennie
thorn
had
stood
up
in
the
and
given
under
oath
the
testimony
that
had
cost
him
his
life
had
given
it
gladly
triumphantly
without
one
thrill
of
pity
or
regard
for
the
man
she
had
once
loved
and
trusted
well
it
was
all
over
now
the
trial
was
a
thing
of
the
past
the
sentence
of
the
law
would
be
carried
out
and
his
neck
would
be
broken
upon
the
scaffold
many
a
time
when
he
thought
of
it
now
with
a
sick
and
shuddering
horror
he
recalled
the
angry
words
that
queenie
lyle
had
spoken
to
him
years
ago
can
not
be
drowned
who
are
born
to
be
his
reckless
wicked
career
was
over
he
had
cheated
men
of
their
substance
at
the
he
had
robbed
women
of
what
was
dearer
their
peace
and
honor
without
a
thought
of
the
retribution
that
would
fall
on
him
from
the
god
he
had
offended
but
now
when
the
priest
came
to
him
and
told
him
solemnly
and
sadly
what
terrors
awaited
him
if
he
died
unrepentant
remorse
and
terror
struck
their
terrible
fangs
into
his
guilty
heart
i
have
done
many
wrongs
that
nothing
can
ever
set
right
father
he
said
humbly
to
the
meek
priest
but
there
is
one
black
falsehood
hanging
heavy
on
my
heart
one
sin
i
may
in
some
little
way
atone
for
will
you
send
lawrence
ernscliffe
to
see
me
i
will
tell
him
how
cruelly
i
wronged
the
lovely
woman
he
married
and
how
pure
and
innocent
she
was
then
and
ever
and
jennie
thorn
father
will
you
ask
her
to
come
and
see
me
i
will
beg
her
to
forgive
me
i
will
send
captain
ernscliffe
to
you
my
son
if
he
will
come
but
jennie
thorn
that
is
impossible
is
she
so
bitter
and
unrelenting
then
said
the
prisoner
sadly
let
us
hope
not
said
the
gentle
priest
but
she
is
gone
away
my
son
immediately
after
your
trial
and
conviction
she
left
the
united
states
and
returned
to
england
as
the
wife
of
the
detective
who
effected
your
arrest
the
prisoner
sighed
and
bent
his
head
the
priest
bowed
over
him
a
moment
murmured
a
benediction
and
passed
out
through
the
heavy
iron
door
that
shut
leon
vinton
in
forever
from
the
busy
beautiful
world
chapter
xlii
a
few
hours
later
the
heavy
iron
door
was
unlocked
then
clanged
together
again
shutting
lawrence
ernscliffe
in
alone
with
the
condemned
prisoner
they
looked
at
each
other
in
blank
silence
for
a
minute
then
the
visitor
said
coldly
you
sent
for
me
yes
i
sent
for
you
said
the
prisoner
eagerly
i
have
wronged
you
and
would
make
reparation
before
before
the
fire
of
rage
and
hatred
that
flared
up
in
the
listener
eyes
was
dreadful
to
behold
you
lied
to
me
how
dared
you
do
it
he
exclaimed
hoarsely
did
i
not
say
i
would
have
your
life
if
i
found
you
out
the
few
hours
of
life
that
remain
to
me
are
not
worth
your
vengeance
was
the
quiet
reply
sit
down
captain
ernscliffe
i
would
speak
to
you
of
your
wife
he
pointed
to
a
chair
but
the
visitor
shook
his
head
no
i
prefer
standing
i
can
scarcely
breathe
the
same
air
with
you
leon
vinton
speak
quickly
do
not
look
on
me
as
your
enemy
now
captain
ernscliffe
said
the
prisoner
deprecatingly
i
stand
apart
from
my
as
a
condemned
criminal
about
to
be
executed
think
of
me
as
a
wretched
sinner
trying
to
make
peace
with
those
whom
i
have
wronged
that
i
may
plead
for
pardon
before
my
offended
god
captain
ernscliffe
bowed
silently
and
the
angry
flash
in
his
dark
eyes
faded
out
at
the
melancholy
tone
and
air
of
the
frightened
and
wretched
criminal
i
lied
to
you
when
i
told
you
that
i
did
not
marry
queenie
lyle
said
leon
vinton
looking
down
and
speaking
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
the
day
she
ran
away
with
me
i
married
her
and
the
certificate
was
placed
in
her
hands
she
thought
she
was
my
wife
but
the
pretended
minister
who
performed
the
ceremony
was
only
a
boon
companion
of
mine
who
had
served
me
before
in
such
an
accommodating
manner
it
was
the
merest
farce
but
queenie
thought
she
was
my
legal
wife
she
would
not
have
gone
with
me
else
she
was
as
pure
and
innocent
as
an
angel
he
paused
a
moment
but
he
did
not
look
up
he
could
not
bear
to
meet
the
tiger
glare
in
the
eyes
of
the
man
before
him
clearing
his
throat
nervously
he
continued
i
lived
with
her
a
year
and
then
we
mutually
wearied
of
each
other
her
keen
intuition
soon
showed
her
that
she
had
been
deceived
in
me
and
that
i
was
far
different
from
the
ideal
which
she
had
placed
on
a
lofty
pedestal
and
worshiped
for
awhile
as
a
god
among
men
she
scorned
me
then
and
i
hated
her
because
she
had
found
me
out
in
my
rage
i
told
her
the
truth
and
then
i
tried
to
kill
her
my
god
captain
ernscliffe
muttered
clenching
his
hands
as
though
he
would
have
torn
the
villain
limb
from
limb
i
thought
i
had
killed
her
pursued
vinton
i
strangled
her
with
both
my
hands
i
threw
her
down
and
trampled
upon
her
beautiful
face
that
had
been
her
ruin
i
hurriedly
dug
her
a
shallow
grave
covered
her
over
with
the
wet
earth
and
leaves
and
hastened
back
to
the
cottage
by
the
river
where
we
had
lived
together
fiend
thundered
captain
ernscliffe
springing
furiously
upon
him
the
prisoner
chained
as
he
was
could
offer
no
resistance
to
his
infuriated
assailant
he
did
not
even
utter
a
cry
but
all
in
a
moment
captain
ernscliffe
remembered
himself
and
drew
back
before
he
had
struck
the
fatal
blow
he
had
meditated
he
would
not
harm
a
defenseless
man
i
will
not
kill
you
he
said
hoarsely
but
finish
your
story
quickly
i
can
scarcely
bear
your
presence
it
was
the
first
murder
i
had
ever
attempted
said
the
prisoner
after
a
breath
naturally
enough
i
felt
nervous
over
it
i
walked
up
and
down
the
for
hours
in
the
rain
trying
to
excuse
myself
to
myself
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
came
up
behind
me
and
pushed
me
in
and
ran
away
it
was
then
that
she
went
home
to
her
parents
they
took
her
back
kept
her
terrible
secret
and
married
her
to
you
if
i
had
let
her
alone
then
all
might
have
gone
well
pursued
the
prisoner
but
i
hated
her
for
her
maddened
blow
that
dark
rainy
night
i
swore
revenge
it
was
i
who
sent
her
the
bouquet
of
flowers
that
caused
her
seeming
death
at
the
altar
that
night
i
resurrected
her
and
made
her
a
prisoner
she
escaped
the
day
that
farmer
thorn
shot
me
she
thought
i
was
dead
but
as
soon
as
i
recovered
from
my
wound
i
started
out
upon
her
trail
again
still
pursuing
my
hellish
scheme
of
vengeance
but
she
escaped
me
for
years
and
i
never
met
her
again
until
the
night
that
i
murdered
her
sister
i
had
just
reached
london
that
night
and
went
into
the
theater
full
of
idle
curiosity
to
see
la
reine
blanche
the
beautiful
idol
of
the
hour
the
moment
she
came
upon
the
stage
i
recognized
in
the
great
actress
the
lovely
girl
i
had
treated
so
inhumanly
in
an
instant
i
conceived
my
diabolical
plan
of
revenge
i
hurried
out
of
the
theater
sent
that
note
to
her
and
waited
at
the
western
door
the
woman
who
came
had
the
voice
the
form
the
step
of
queenie
and
i
plunged
my
dagger
in
her
heart
i
killed
sydney
but
the
blow
was
meant
for
queenie
he
stopped
and
there
was
silence
in
the
gloomy
while
the
criminal
waited
for
ernscliffe
to
speak
you
are
telling
me
the
truth
he
demanded
hoarsely
as
god
is
my
judge
and
on
the
word
of
a
dying
man
let
queenie
tell
you
her
story
and
she
will
corroborate
my
words
i
have
pursued
her
pitilessly
remorselessly
i
have
wronged
her
beyond
all
reparation
yet
she
is
as
pure
and
true
and
innocent
as
she
was
that
fatal
hour
when
i
first
met
her
a
happy
thoughtless
girl
selling
her
painted
fan
to
buy
her
simple
my
terrible
sin
against
her
is
enough
of
itself
to
drag
my
soul
down
to
the
lowest
depths
of
perdition
added
the
prisoner
with
a
hollow
groan
you
have
indeed
sinned
fearfully
and
god
will
punish
you
said
captain
ernscliffe
turning
to
go
a
moment
longer
pleaded
the
unhappy
wretch
say
that
you
forgive
me
before
you
go
never
in
this
world
or
in
the
next
cried
captain
ernscliffe
furiously
the
grated
door
unclosing
let
in
the
priest
who
was
to
spend
the
night
with
the
condemned
man
he
caught
their
parting
words
my
son
my
son
he
said
laying
his
withered
hand
on
ernscliffe
arm
forgive
the
poor
soul
he
is
almost
beyond
your
resentment
think
where
his
soul
will
be
night
give
him
your
hand
in
token
of
pardon
no
no
said
the
listener
shuddering
i
will
not
touch
his
hand
but
but
with
a
great
effort
i
will
forgive
him
tell
to
forgive
me
too
said
leon
vinton
looking
at
him
with
his
wild
frightened
face
tell
her
i
am
sorry
tell
her
that
i
repent
she
is
an
angel
she
will
forgive
me
the
door
closed
upon
the
retreating
form
and
the
gentle
priest
knelt
down
and
began
to
pray
for
the
guilty
soul
so
soon
to
be
launched
into
a
dread
eternity
chapter
xliii
captain
ernscliffe
found
that
it
was
almost
midnight
when
he
reached
home
after
his
visit
to
the
condemned
murderer
he
was
too
excited
for
sleep
and
going
to
the
library
he
turned
up
the
gas
and
prepared
to
spend
the
remaining
hours
of
the
night
among
his
books
a
pleasant
warmth
pervaded
the
luxurious
apartment
and
the
fragrance
of
some
white
hyacinths
blooming
in
vases
on
the
marble
mantel
filled
the
air
with
sweetness
they
were
queenie
favorite
flowers
he
remembered
the
one
she
had
worn
on
her
breast
the
day
he
had
come
upon
her
in
her
strange
interview
with
sydney
breaking
off
a
beautiful
spray
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
then
pinned
it
on
his
coat
i
wonder
where
she
is
now
he
said
to
himself
with
a
heavy
sigh
as
he
drew
up
a
chair
to
the
table
and
laid
his
head
down
upon
his
folded
arms
something
rustled
under
his
touch
as
he
did
so
and
he
looked
up
quickly
there
was
a
sealed
letter
lying
upon
the
table
addressed
to
himself
in
an
unfamiliar
writing
it
had
been
laid
there
by
a
servant
while
he
was
absent
mechanically
he
tore
it
open
and
glanced
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
for
his
unknown
correspondent
name
robert
lyle
he
read
aloud
with
a
suddenly
quickened
yes
it
was
from
robert
lyle
a
brief
note
coldly
and
curtly
written
captain
ernscliffe
it
simply
ran
i
arrived
in
this
city
with
your
wife
she
is
now
quite
well
and
prepared
to
defend
her
case
at
any
time
the
lawyers
agree
upon
if
necessary
that
was
all
it
was
brief
cold
and
to
the
point
yet
the
heart
thrilled
with
sudden
joy
she
is
here
in
this
city
she
is
well
he
said
to
himself
oh
how
can
i
wait
until
but
he
waited
nevertheless
though
burning
with
anxiety
and
impatience
and
at
the
earliest
permissible
hour
he
was
shown
into
robert
private
parlor
at
the
hotel
where
he
was
stopping
lyle
was
sitting
cozily
over
his
morning
paper
and
cigar
his
slippered
feet
on
the
fender
his
gorgeous
wrapped
comfortably
around
him
he
rose
in
some
surprise
as
his
unexpected
visitor
was
ushered
in
you
did
not
expect
me
said
captain
ernscliffe
as
they
shook
hands
i
received
your
letter
at
midnight
sir
and
came
this
morning
as
early
as
propriety
would
allow
i
want
to
see
my
wife
lyle
he
added
in
a
trembling
voice
will
you
take
her
my
card
and
see
if
she
will
admit
me
to
her
presence
lyle
looked
at
him
curiously
a
moment
he
saw
that
he
was
struggling
with
some
unexplained
agitation
and
that
he
had
not
come
with
any
hostile
intent
he
pointed
toward
a
side
door
that
stood
slightly
ajar
she
is
in
there
he
said
there
is
no
need
of
formalities
go
in
and
see
her
with
a
faltering
step
captain
ernscliffe
advanced
and
passed
through
the
partly
open
door
he
found
himself
in
a
beautiful
little
with
hangings
of
silk
exquisitely
furnished
and
pervaded
with
the
delicate
perfume
of
white
hyacinth
before
the
bright
fire
burning
in
the
polished
grate
a
lady
was
sitting
in
a
low
rocker
of
cushioned
blue
satin
he
advanced
toward
her
then
started
back
he
thought
he
had
made
a
mistake
for
the
beautiful
woman
sitting
there
in
her
elegant
of
quilted
blue
satin
was
looking
down
and
smiling
at
something
that
lay
on
her
arm
nestled
close
and
warm
against
her
breast
it
was
the
pink
face
of
a
very
tiny
baby
wrapped
in
costly
robes
of
embroidered
flannel
and
lace
and
cambric
captain
ernscliffe
was
going
out
quite
precipitately
when
a
low
startled
voice
cried
out
lawrence
he
turned
back
and
looked
more
closely
yes
it
queenie
but
then
baby
where
on
earth
and
at
that
stage
of
his
cogitations
something
flashed
across
his
mind
this
then
was
the
cause
of
that
long
mysterious
illness
what
a
fool
he
had
been
not
to
suspect
it
before
he
rushed
to
her
side
and
kneeling
down
upon
the
carpet
put
his
arms
around
the
beautiful
mother
and
child
my
darling
he
murmured
in
a
voice
so
broken
by
emotion
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
at
all
my
precious
queenie
my
own
sweet
wife
shall
we
mutually
forgive
and
forget
all
that
is
past
one
stifled
sob
of
joy
and
then
the
woman
dropped
her
face
upon
his
shoulder
in
silence
one
moment
of
rapturous
stillness
while
she
rested
in
the
close
clasp
of
his
strong
arm
and
then
he
whispered
with
his
lips
against
her
warm
cheek
darling
you
will
forget
my
cruelty
and
come
back
to
me
you
and
the
little
one
then
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
him
with
a
happy
little
laugh
and
a
very
bright
blush
lawrence
kiss
our
little
boy
she
said
putting
the
little
bundle
in
his
arms
is
he
not
a
pretty
babe
i
call
him
robbie
for
my
uncle
who
has
been
so
good
and
kind
in
all
my
trouble
while
i
have
been
so
cruel
and
unkind
he
said
remorsefully
but
that
is
all
past
now
she
said
hopefully
oh
lawrence
i
thought
you
would
never
return
to
me
again
what
caused
you
to
forgive
me
that
villain
whom
i
can
not
curse
now
because
he
was
hung
this
morning
confessed
all
to
me
last
night
my
darling
you
were
cruelly
wronged
and
i
was
mad
and
blind
to
believe
all
the
lies
he
told
me
at
first
the
best
he
could
tell
you
was
bad
enough
she
said
remorsefully
it
was
wicked
it
was
terrible
of
me
to
have
encouraged
that
clandestine
acquaintance
and
secret
love
deserting
my
home
and
loved
ones
for
a
stranger
of
whom
i
knew
nothing
except
that
he
was
handsome
and
that
his
romantic
wooing
took
my
foolish
heart
by
storm
oh
the
bitter
consequences
that
have
followed
that
act
of
girlish
folly
my
own
deep
disgrace
my
father
death
from
a
broken
heart
poor
sydney
dreadful
murder
mamma
and
georgina
everlasting
alienation
from
me
she
clasped
her
hands
and
tears
stood
bright
as
in
her
soft
blue
eyes
yes
darling
he
said
as
he
laid
his
little
son
back
in
her
arms
your
youthful
folly
has
indeed
worked
out
a
terrible
retribution
if
your
tragic
story
could
be
written
it
might
teach
many
parents
to
guard
their
daughters
more
carefully
and
many
a
thoughtless
girl
might
grow
wiser
and
profit
by
your
dreadful
experience
the
fitting
text
for
such
a
mournful
story
might
be
never
keep
a
secret
from
your
parents
am
i
asked
uncle
robert
putting
his
gray
head
and
smiling
face
into
the
room
at
that
moment
never
uncle
robert
you
are
one
of
us
now
and
always
said
captain
ernscliffe
bringing
him
in
and
giving
him
a
cordial
pressure
of
the
hand
queenie
looked
up
with
the
bright
tears
still
shining
in
her
eyes
he
kissed
her
fondly
then
bent
over
the
little
babe
to
hide
the
dew
of
tenderness
that
dimmed
his
kindly
blue
orbs
i
shall
have
to
give
up
my
little
pet
now
he
said
a
little
sadly
no
you
shall
not
uncle
robbie
you
are
to
come
home
with
us
and
live
with
us
always
you
shall
not
live
alone
any
longer
said
queenie
tenderly
and
gratefully
three
years
later
when
robbie
was
the
loveliest
and
most
mischievous
little
lad
that
ever
delighted
a
parent
heart
they
all
went
abroad
again
captain
ernscliffe
who
was
the
fondest
and
most
devoted
husband
in
the
world
had
taken
an
absurd
fancy
that
queenie
roses
were
fading
and
that
a
european
tour
would
improve
her
health
so
one
bright
sunny
morning
in
the
month
of
roses
they
found
themselves
registered
as
boarders
at
a
famous
health
resort
in
germany
but
after
captain
ernscliffe
had
smoked
his
cigar
on
the
balcony
he
came
into
his
wife
airy
room
with
a
frown
on
his
dark
handsome
face
i
shall
have
to
take
you
away
my
dear
he
said
i
have
found
out
that
your
mother
and
sister
are
staying
here
of
course
it
would
be
embarrassing
to
all
parties
if
we
remained
yes
we
must
go
away
she
said
but
she
sighed
as
she
spoke
it
had
been
a
bitter
cross
to
her
that
her
mother
and
sister
would
not
recognize
her
she
loved
them
still
for
the
ties
of
kinship
were
very
strong
in
her
heart
now
her
own
motherhood
had
made
her
even
more
gentle
and
loving
than
before
she
would
have
loved
dearly
to
be
friends
with
those
proud
ones
who
had
discarded
her
and
to
have
shown
her
beautiful
little
son
to
his
grandmother
yes
we
will
go
away
she
repeated
brushing
away
a
tear
we
must
not
trouble
their
peace
but
that
evening
when
her
husband
and
her
uncle
had
gone
out
for
a
walk
and
she
was
alone
with
robbie
she
heard
a
timid
and
hesitating
rap
at
her
door
enter
she
said
looking
up
in
some
surprise
the
door
opened
and
lady
valentine
came
abruptly
into
the
room
she
was
paler
and
graver
than
of
old
and
her
stately
form
was
draped
in
the
gloomy
sables
of
a
widow
georgina
exclaimed
ernscliffe
starting
up
lady
valentine
rushed
forward
and
threw
her
arms
about
the
trembling
hesitating
figure
little
queenie
my
sweet
wronged
sister
she
cried
will
you
forgive
my
cruelty
to
you
and
love
your
georgie
again
i
have
never
ceased
to
love
you
georgie
was
the
answer
lady
valentine
pressed
a
dozen
kisses
on
the
sweet
lips
and
wavy
golden
hair
queenie
put
her
gently
into
a
chair
and
then
she
saw
a
little
lad
looking
at
her
with
a
great
deal
of
wonder
what
a
lovely
boy
she
said
and
it
is
yours
queenie
i
know
for
he
looks
so
like
your
husband
yes
answered
queenie
proudly
then
she
led
her
little
son
up
to
her
sister
robbie
you
must
kiss
your
aunt
she
said
lady
valentine
stayed
a
long
while
with
queenie
and
many
mutual
touching
confidences
were
exchanged
by
the
sisters
at
last
she
rose
to
go
may
i
have
robbie
a
little
while
she
asked
you
may
go
with
your
aunt
my
dear
said
queenie
kissing
the
child
lady
valentine
took
his
hand
and
led
him
away
to
a
room
where
a
lady
was
sitting
alone
in
the
twilight
with
a
grave
rather
sad
expression
on
her
handsome
old
face
georgie
lifted
up
robbie
and
placed
him
on
the
lady
knee
grandmother
she
said
kiss
your
grandson
it
is
queenie
child
cried
lyle
pressing
him
to
her
heart
and
kissing
him
then
crying
over
him
in
her
womanly
joy
and
excitement
we
must
take
him
to
his
mother
now
said
georgie
come
mamma
and
lyle
followed
her
without
a
word
so
when
captain
ernscliffe
and
lyle
returned
from
their
walk
they
found
them
all
together
queenie
fair
face
perfectly
radiant
and
every
one
very
happy
in
this
touching
reunion
they
were
never
parted
afterwards
when
lyle
and
the
ernscliffes
returned
to
the
united
states
lyle
and
lady
valentine
went
with
them
lyle
had
conceived
such
an
affection
for
her
little
grandson
that
she
could
not
bear
to
be
separated
from
him
georgina
had
no
ties
to
bind
her
to
england
so
she
followed
them
also
many
years
of
calm
happiness
came
to
ernscliffe
afterward
but
she
never
forgot
the
terrible
secret
that
had
almost
desolated
her
life
she
had
one
daughter
a
sweet
and
lovely
girl
who
bore
the
name
of
one
long
dead
and
sometimes
when
she
kissed
and
caressed
her
captain
ernscliffe
would
hear
her
say
sweetly
and
gravely
sydney

darling
daughter
you
