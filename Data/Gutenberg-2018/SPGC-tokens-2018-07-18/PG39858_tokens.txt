under

at

from

that
make
a
place
genial
homelike
and
good
to
remember
and
sweet
to
muse
upon
with
fond
regret
in
and
an
immense
divan
spread
itself
in
width
and
length
and
delightful
thickness
just
beneath
the
big
north
window
the
business
window
a
divan
so
immense
that
three
englishmen
could
all
lie
lazily
smoking
their
pipes
on
it
at
once
without
being
in
each
other
way
and
very
often
did
at
present
one
of
these
englishmen
a
yorkshireman
called
taffy
and
also
the
man
of
blood
because
he
was
supposed
to
be
distantly
related
to
a
baronet
was
more
energetically
engaged
and
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
he
was
twirling
a
pair
of
indian
clubs
round
his
head
his
face
was
flushed
and
he
was
perspiring
freely
and
looked
fierce
he
was
a
very
big
young
man
fair
with
kind
but
choleric
blue
eyes
and
the
muscles
of
his
brawny
arm
were
strong
as
iron
bands
for
three
years
he
had
borne
her
majesty
commission
and
had
been
through
the
crimean
campaign
without
a
scratch
he
would
have
been
one
of
the
famous
six
hundred
in
the
famous
charge
at
balaklava
but
for
a
sprained
ankle
caught
playing
leapfrog
in
the
trenches
which
kept
him
in
hospital
on
that
momentous
day
so
that
he
lost
his
chance
of
glory
or
the
grave
and
this
humiliating
misadventure
had
sickened
him
of
soldiering
for
life
and
he
never
quite
got
over
it
then
feeling
within
himself
an
irresistible
vocation
for
art
he
had
sold
out
and
here
he
was
in
paris
hard
at
work
as
we
see
illustration
taffy
alias
talbot
wynne
he
was
with
straight
features
but
i
regret
to
say
that
besides
his
heavy
plunger
mustache
he
wore
an
immense
pair
of
drooping
auburn
whiskers
of
the
kind
that
used
to
be
called
piccadilly
weepers
and
were
afterwards
affected
by
sothern
in
lord
dundreary
it
was
a
fashion
to
do
so
then
for
such
of
our
gilded
youth
as
could
afford
the
time
and
the
hair
the
bigger
and
fairer
the
whiskers
the
more
beautiful
was
thought
the
youth
it
seems
incredible
in
these
days
when
even
her
majesty
household
brigade
go
about
with
smooth
cheeks
and
lips
like
priests

another
inmate

this
blissful
abode
sandy
the
laird
of
cockpen
as
he
was
called
sat
in
similarly
simple
attire
at
his
easel
painting
at
a
lifelike
little
picture
of
a
spanish
toreador
serenading
a
lady
of
high
degree
in
broad
daylight
he
had
never
been
to
spain
but
he
had
a
complete
toreador
kit
a
bargain
which
he
had
picked
up
for
a
mere
song
in
the
boulevard
du
temple
and
he
had
hired
the
guitar
his
pipe
was
in
his
mouth
reversed
for
it
had
gone
out
and
the
ashes
were
spilled
all
over
his
trousers
where
holes
were
often
burned
in
this
way
quite
gratuitously
and
with
a
pleasing
scotch
accent
he
began
to
declaim
a
street
there
is
in
paris
famous
for
which
no
rhyme
our
language
yields
roo
nerve
day
petty
shong
its
name
is
the
new
street
of
the
little
fields
and
then
in
his
keen
appreciation
of
the
immortal
stanza
he
chuckled
audibly
with
a
face
so
blithe
and
merry
and
well
pleased
that
it
did
one
good
to
look
at
him
he
also
had
entered
life
by
another
door
his
parents
good
pious
people
in
dundee
had
intended
that
he
should
be
a
solicitor
as
his
father
and
grandfather
had
been
before
him
and
here
he
was
in
paris
famous
painting
toreadors
and
spouting
the
ballad
of
the
bouillabaisse
as
he
would
often
do
out
of
sheer
lightness
of
heart
much
oftener
indeed
than
he
would
say
his
prayers
kneeling
on
the
divan
with
his
elbow

third
and
much
younger
youth
the
third

was
little
billee
he
had
pulled
down
the
green
baize
blind
and
was
looking
over
the
roofs
and
of
paris
and
all
about
with
all
his
eyes
munching
the
while
a
roll
and
a
savory
saveloy
in
which
there
was
evidence
of
much
garlic
he
ate
with
great
relish
for
he
was
very
hungry

had
been
all
the
morning
at

drawing
from
the
life
little

small
and
slender
about
twenty
or
and
had
a
straight
white
forehead
veined
with
blue
large
eyes
delicate
regular
features
and
hair
he
was
also
very
graceful
and
well
built
with
very
small
hands
and
feet
and
much
better
dressed
than
his
friends
who
went
out
of
their
way
to
outdo
the
denizens
of
the
quartier
latin
in
careless
eccentricity
of
garb
and
succeeded
and
in
his
winning
and
handsome
face
there
was
just
a
faint
suggestion
of
some
possible
very
remote
jewish
ancestor
just
a
tinge
of
that
strong
sturdy
irrepressible
indomitable
indelible
blood
which
is
of
such
priceless
value
in
diluted
homœopathic
doses
like
the
dry
white
spanish
wine
called
montijo
which
is
not
meant
to
be
taken
pure
but
without
a
judicious
admixture
of
which
no
sherry
can
go
round
the
world
and
keep
its
flavor
intact
or
like
the
famous
strain
which
is
not
beautiful
in
itself
and
yet
just
for
lacking
a
little
of
the
same
no
greyhound
can
ever
hope
to
be
a
champion
so
at
least
i
have
been
told
by
and
the
most
veracious
persons
that
can
be
fortunately
for
the
world
and
especially
for
ourselves
most
of
us
have
in
our
veins
at

a

precious
fluid

we

it

show
it
or

little
billee

also
gazed
at
the
busy
place
below
the
place
anatole
des
arts
at
the
old
houses
opposite
some
of
which
were
being
pulled
down
no
doubt
lest
they
should
fall
of
their
own
sweet
will
in
the
gaps
between
he
would
see
discolored
old
cracked
dingy
walls
with
mysterious
windows
and
rusty
iron
balconies
of
great
antiquity
sights
that
set
him
dreaming
dreams
of
mediæval
french
love
and
wickedness
and
crime
bygone
mysteries
of
paris
illustration
the
third
he
was
billee
one
gap
went
right
through
the
block
and
gave
him
a
glimpse
of
the
river
the
cité
and
the
ominous
old
morgue
a
little
to
the
right
rose
the
gray
towers
of
notre
dame
de
paris
into
the
checkered
april
sky
indeed
the
top
of
nearly
all
paris
lay
before
him
with
a
little
stretch
of
the
imagination
on
his
part
and
he
gazed
with
a
sense
of
novelty
an
interest
and
a
pleasure
for
which
he
could
not
have
found
any
expression
in
mere
language
paris
paris
paris
the
very
name
had
always
been
one
to
conjure
with
whether
he
thought
of
it
as
a
mere
sound
on
the
lips
and
in
the
ear
or
as
a
magical
written
or
printed
word
for
the
eye
and
here
was
the
thing
itself
at
last
and
he
he
himself
ipsissimus
in
the
very
midst
of
it
to
live
there
and
learn
there
as
long
as
he
liked
and
make
himself
the
great
artist
he
longed
to
be
then
his
meal
finished
he
lit
a
pipe
and
flung
himself
on
the
divan
and
sighed
deeply
out
of
the
contentment
of
his
heart
he
felt
he
had
never
known
happiness
like
this
never
even
dreamed
its
possibility
and
yet
his
life
had
been
a
happy
one
he
was
young
and
tender
was
little
billee
he
had
never
been
to
any
school
and
was
innocent
of
the
world
and
its
wicked
ways
innocent
of
french
especially
and
the
ways
of
paris
and
its
latin
quarter
he
had
been
brought
up
and
educated
at
home
had
spent
his
boyhood
in
london
with
his
mother
and
sister
who
now
lived
in
devonshire
on
somewhat
straitened
means
his
father
who
was
dead
had
been
a
clerk
in
the
treasury
he
and
his
two
friends
taffy
and
the
laird
had
taken
this
studio
together
the
laird
slept
there
in

small
bedroom
off

looked
at
his
two
friends
and
wondered
if
any
one
living
or
dead
had
ever
had
such
a
glorious
pair
of
chums
as
these
whatever
they
did
whatever
they
said
was
simply
perfect
in
his
eyes
they
were
his
guides
and
philosophers
as
well
as
his
chums
on
the
other
hand
taffy
and
the
laird
were
as
fond
of
the
boy
as
they
could
be
his
absolute
belief
in
all
they
said
and
did
touched
them
none
the
less
that
they
were
conscious
of
its
being
somewhat
in
excess
of
their
deserts
his
almost
girlish
purity
of
mind
amused
and
charmed
them
and
they
did
all
they
could
to
preserve
it
even
in
the
quartier
latin
where
purity
is
apt
to
go
bad
if
it
be
kept
too
long
illustration
it
did
one
good
to
look
at
him
they
loved
him
for
his
affectionate
disposition
his
lively
and
caressing
ways
and
they
admired
him
far
more
than
he
ever
knew
for
they
recognized
in
him
a
quickness
a
keenness
a
delicacy
of
perception
in
matters
of
form
and
color
a
mysterious
facility
and
felicity
of
execution
a
sense
of
all
that
was
sweet
and
beautiful
in
nature
and
a
ready
power
of
expressing
it
that
had
not
been
vouchsafed
to
them
in
any
such
generous
profusion
and
which
as
they
ungrudgingly
admitted
to
themselves
and
each
other
amounted
to
true
genius
and
when
one
within
the
immediate
circle
of
our
intimates
is
gifted
in
this
abnormal
fashion
we
either
hate
or
love
him
for
it
in
proportion
to
the
greatness
of
his
gift
according
to
the
way
we
are
built
so
taffy
and
the
laird
loved
little
billee
loved
him
very
much
indeed
not
but
what
little
billee
had
his
faults
for
instance
he
interest
himself
very
warmly
in
other
people
pictures
he
did
seem
to
care
for
the
laird
toreador
nor
for
his
serenaded
lady
at
all
events
he
never
said
anything
about
them
either
in
praise
or
blame
he
looked
at
taffy
realisms
for
taffy
was
a
realist
in
silence
and
nothing
tries
true
friendship
so
much
as
silence
of
this
kind
but
then
to
make
up
for
it
when
they
all
three
went
to
the
louvre
he
did
seem
to
trouble
much
about
titian
either
or
rembrandt
or
velasquez
rubens
veronese
or
leonardo
he
looked
at
the
people
who
looked
at
the
pictures
instead
of
at
the
pictures
themselves
especially
at
the
people
who
copied
them
the
sometimes
charming
young
lady
painters
and
these
seemed
to
him
even
more
charming
than
they
really
were
and
he
looked
a
great
deal
out
of
the
louvre
windows
where
there
was
much
to
be
seen
more
paris
for
instance
paris
of
which
he
could
never
have
enough
but
when
surfeited
with
classical
beauty
they
all
three
went
and
dined
together
and
taffy
and
the
laird
said
beautiful
things
about
the
old
masters
and
quarrelled
about
them
he
listened
with
deference
and
rapt
attention
and
reverentially
agreed
with
all
they
said
and
afterwards
made
the
most
delightfully
funny
little
sketches
of
them
saying
all
these
beautiful
things
which
he
sent
to
his
mother
and
sister
at
home
so
so
real
that
you
could
almost
hear
the
beautiful
things
they
said
so
beautifully
drawn
that
you
felt
the
old
masters
could
have
drawn
them
better
themselves
and
so
irresistibly
droll
that
you
felt
that
the
old
masters
could
not
have
drawn
them
at
all
any
more
than
milton
could
have
described
the
quarrel
between
sairey
gamp
and
betsy
prig
no
one
in
short
but
little
billee
little
billee
took
up
the
ballad
of
the
bouillabaisse
where
the
laird
had
left
it
off
and
speculated
on
the
future
of
himself
and
his
friends
when
he
should
have
got
to
forty
years
an
almost
impossibly
remote
future
these
speculations
were
interrupted
by
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
and
two
men
came
in
first
a
tall
bony
individual
of
any
age
between
thirty
and
of
jewish
aspect
but
sinister
he
was
very
shabby
and
dirty
and
wore
a
red
béret
and
a
large
velveteen
cloak
with
a
big
metal
clasp
at
the
collar
his
thick
heavy
languid
lustreless
black
hair
fell
down
behind
his
ears
on
to
his
shoulders
in
that
musicianlike
way
that
is
so
offensive
to
the
normal
englishman
he
had
bold
brilliant
black
eyes
with
long
heavy
lids
a
thin
sallow
face
and
a
beard
of
black
which
grew
almost
from
his
under
eyelids
and
over
it
his
mustache
a
shade
lighter
fell
in
two
long
spiral
twists
he
went
by
the
name
of
svengali
and
spoke
fluent
french
with
a
german
accent
and
humorous
german
twists
and
idioms
and
his
voice
was
very
thin
and
mean
and
harsh
and
often
broke
into
a
disagreeable
falsetto
his
companion
was
a
little
swarthy
young
man
a
gypsy
possibly
much
pitted
with
the
and
also
very
shabby
he
had
large
soft
affectionate
brown
eyes
like
a
king
charles
spaniel
he
had
small
nervous
veiny
hands
with
nails
bitten
down
to
the
quick
and
carried
a
fiddle
and
a
fiddlestick
under
his
arm
without
a
case
as
though
he
had
been
playing
in
the
street
ponchour
mes
enfants
said
svengali
che
vous
amène
mon
ami
checko
qui
choue
du

gomme
un
anche
little
billee
who
adored
all
sweet
musicianers
jumped
up
and
made
gecko
as
warmly
welcome
as
he
could
in
his
early
french
ha
le
biâno
exclaimed
svengali
flinging
his
red
béret
on
it
and
his
cloak
on
the
ground
est
pon
et
pien
and
sitting
down
on
the
he
ran
up
and
down
the
scales
with
that
easy
power
that
smooth
even
crispness
of
touch
which
reveal
the
master
illustration
among
the
old
masters
then
he
fell
to
playing
chopin
impromptu
in
a
flat
so
beautifully
that
little
billee
heart
went
nigh
to
bursting
with
suppressed
emotion
and
delight
he
had
never
heard
any
music
of
chopin
before
nothing
but
british
provincial
music
melodies
with
variations
annie
laurie
the
last
rose
of
summer
the
blue
bells
of
scotland
innocent
little
motherly
and
sisterly
tinklings
invented
to
set
the
company
at
their
ease
on
festive
evenings
and
make
conversation
possible
for
shy
people
who
fear
the
unaccompanied
sound
of
their
own
voices
and
whose
genial
chatter
always
leaves
off
directly
the
music
ceases
he
never
forgot
that
impromptu
which
he
was
destined
to
hear
again
one
day
in
strange
circumstances
then
svengali
and
gecko
made
music
together
divinely
little
fragmentary
things
sometimes
consisting
but
of
a
few
bars
but
these
bars
of
beauty
and
meaning
scraps
snatches
short
melodies
meant
to
fetch
to
charm
immediately
or
to
melt
or
sadden
or
madden
just
for
a
moment
and
that
knew
just
when
to
leave
off
czardas
gypsy
dances
hungarian
things
little
known
out
of
eastern
europe
in
the
fifties
of
this
century
till
the
laird
and
taffy
were
almost
as
wild
in
their
enthusiasm
as
little
billee
a
silent
enthusiasm
too
deep
for
speech
and
when
these
two
great
artists
left
off
to
smoke
the
three
britishers
were
too
much
moved
even
for
that
and
there
was
a
stillness
suddenly
there
came
a
loud
at
the
outer
door
and
a
portentous
voice
of
great
volume
and
that
might
almost
have
belonged
to
any
sex
even
an
angel
uttered
the
british
milkman
yodel
milk
below
and
before
any
one
could
say
entrez
a
strange
figure
appeared
framed
by
the
gloom
of
the
little
antechamber
it
was
the
figure
of
a
very
tall
and
fully
developed
young
female
clad
in
the
gray
overcoat
of
a
french
infantry
soldier
continued
netherwards
by
a
short
striped
petticoat
beneath
which
were
visible
her
bare
white
ankles
and
insteps
and
slim
straight
rosy
heels
clean
cut
and
smooth
as
the
back
of
a
razor
her
toes
lost
themselves
in
a
huge
pair
of
male
list
slippers
which
made
her
drag
her
feet
as
she
walked
she
bore
herself
with
easy
unembarrassed
grace
like
a
person
whose
nerves
and
muscles
are
well
in
tune
whose
spirits
are
high
who
has
lived
much
in
the
atmosphere
of
french
studios
and
feels
at
home
in
it
this
strange
medley
of
garments
was
surmounted
by
a
small
bare
head
with
short
thick
wavy
brown
hair
and
a
very
healthy
young
face
which
could
scarcely
be
called
quite
beautiful
at
first
sight
since
the
eyes
were
too
wide
apart
the
mouth
too
large
the
chin
too
massive
the
complexion
a
mass
of
freckles
besides
you
can
never
tell
how
beautiful
or
how
ugly
a
face
may
be
till
you
have
tried
to
draw
it
but
a
small
portion
of
her
neck
down
by
the
which
just
showed
itself
between
the
unbuttoned
lapels
of
her
military
coat
collar
was
of
a
delicate
privetlike
whiteness
that
is
never
to
be
found
on
any
french
neck
and
very
few
english
ones
also
she
had
a
very
fine
brow
broad
and
low
with
thick
level
eyebrows
much
darker
than
her
hair
a
broad
bony
high
bridge
to
her
short
nose
and
her
full
broad
cheeks
were
beautifully
modelled
she
would
have
made
a
singularly
handsome
boy
as
the
creature
looked
round
at
the
assembled
company
and
flashed
her
big
white
teeth
at
them
in
an
smile
of
uncommon
width
and
quite
irresistible
sweetness
simplicity
and
friendly
trust
one
saw
at
a
glance
that
she
was
out
of
the
common
clever
simple
humorous
honest
brave
and
kind
and
accustomed
to
be
genially
welcomed
wherever
she
went
then
suddenly
closing
the
door
behind
her
dropping
her
smile
and
looking
wistful
and
sweet
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
her
arms
akimbo
ye
all
english
now
are
ye
she
exclaimed
i
heard
the
music
and
thought
i
just
come
in
for
a
bit
and
pass
the
time
of
day
you
do
mind
trilby
that
my
name
trilby
she
said
this
in
english
with
an
accent
half
scotch
and
certain
french
intonations
and
in
a
voice
so
rich
and
deep
and
full
as
almost
to
suggest
an
incipient
tenore
robusto
and
one
felt
instinctively
that
it
was
a
real
pity
she
was
a
boy
she
would
have
made
such
a
jolly
one
we
delighted
on
the
contrary
said
little
billee
and
advanced
a
chair
for
her
but
she
said
oh
do
mind
me
go
on
with
the
music
and
sat
herself
down
on
the
near
the
piano
as
they
still
looked
at
her
curious
and
half
embarrassed
she
pulled
a
paper
parcel
containing
food
out
of
one
of
the
and
exclaimed
illustration
wistful
and
sweet
i
just
take
a
bite
if
you
do
object
i
a
model
you
know
and
it
just
rung
twelve
rest
i
posing
for
durien
the
sculptor
on
the
next
floor
i
pose
to
him
for
the
altogether
the
altogether
asked
little
billee
yes
you
know
head
hands
and
feet
everything
especially
feet
that
my
foot
she
said
kicking
off
her
big
slipper
and
stretching
out
the
limb
it
the
handsomest
foot
in
all
paris
there
only
one
in
all
paris
to
match
it
and
here
it
is
and
she
laughed
heartily
like
a
merry
peal
of
bells
and
stuck
out
the
other
and
in
truth
they
were
astonishingly
beautiful
feet
such
as
one
only
sees
in
pictures
and
statues
a
true
inspiration
of
shape
and
color
all
made
up
of
delicate
lengths
and
subtly
modulated
curves
and
noble
straightnesses
and
happy
little
dimpled
arrangements
in
innocent
young
pink
and
white
so
that
little
billee
who
had
the
quick
prehensile
æsthetic
eye
and
knew
by
the
grace
of
heaven
what
the
shapes
and
sizes
and
colors
of
almost
every
bit
of
man
woman
or
child
should
be
and
so
seldom
are
was
quite
bewildered
to
find
that
a
real
bare
live
human
foot
could
be
such
a
charming
object
to
look
at
and
felt
that
such
a
base
or
pedestal
lent
quite
an
antique
and
olympian
dignity
to
a
figure
that
seemed
just
then
rather
grotesque
in
its
mixed
attire
of
military
overcoat
and
female
petticoat
and
nothing
else
poor
trilby
the
shape
of
those
lovely
slender
feet
that
were
neither
large
nor
small
in
dusty
pale
plaster
of
paris
survives
on
the
shelves
and
walls
of
many
a
studio
throughout
the
world
and
many
a
sculptor
yet
unborn
has
yet
to
marvel
at
their
strange
perfection
in
studious
despair
for
when
dame
nature
takes
it
into
her
head
to
do
her
very
best
and
bestow
her
minutest
attention
on
a
mere
detail
as
happens
now
and
then
once
in
a
blue
moon
perhaps
she
makes
it
uphill
work
for
poor
human
art
to
keep
pace
with
her
it
is
a
wondrous
thing
the
human
foot
like
the
human
hand
even
more
so
perhaps
but
unlike
the
hand
with
which
we
are
so
familiar
it
is
seldom
a
thing
of
beauty
in
civilized
adults
who
go
about
in
leather
boots
or
shoes
so
that
it
is
hidden
away
in
disgrace
a
thing
to
be
thrust
out
of
sight
and
forgotten
it
can
sometimes
be
very
ugly
indeed
the
ugliest
thing
there
is
even
in
the
fairest
and
highest
and
most
gifted
of
her
sex
and
then
it
is
of
an
ugliness
to
chill
and
kill
romance
and
scatter
young
love
dream
and
almost
break
the
heart
and
all
for
the
sake
of
a
high
heel
and
a
ridiculously
pointed
toe
mean
things
at
the
best
conversely
when
mother
nature
has
taken
extra
pains
in
the
building
of
it
and
proper
care
or
happy
chance
has
kept
it
free
of
lamentable
deformations
indurations
and
discolorations
all
those
grewsome
abominations
which
have
made
it
so
generally
unpopular
the
sudden
sight
of
it
uncovered
comes
as
a
very
rare
and
singularly
pleasing
surprise
to
the
eye
that
has
learned
how
to
see
nothing
else
that
mother
nature
has
to
show
not
even
the
human
face
divine
has
more
subtle
power
to
suggest
high
physical
distinction
happy
evolution
and
supreme
development
the
lordship
of
man
over
beast
the
lordship
of
man
over
man
the
lordship
of

over

had
always
taken
as
much
care

her

as
many
a
fine

it
was
her
one
coquetry
the
only
real
vanity
she
had
gecko
his
fiddle
in
one
hand
and
his
bow
in
the
other
stared
at
her
in
admiration
and
delight
as
she
ate
her
sandwich
of
soldier
bread
and
à

quite
unconcerned
when
she
had
finished
she
licked
the
tips
of
her
fingers
clean
of
cheese
and
produced
a
small
from
another
military
pocket
and
made
herself
a
cigarette
and
lit
it
and
smoked
it
inhaling
the
smoke
in
large
whiffs
filling
her
lungs
with
it
and
sending
it
back
through
her
nostrils
with
a
look
of
great
beatitude
svengali
played
schubert
rosemonde
and
flashed
a
pair
of
languishing
black
eyes
at
her
with
intent
to
kill
but
she
did
even
look
his
way
she
looked
at
little
billee
at
big
taffy
at
the
laird
at
the
casts
and
studies
at
the
sky
the
over
the

visible
from
where
she
sat

when

finished
she
exclaimed
maïe

vous
savez
comment
it
is
called
the
of
schubert
matemoiselle
replied
svengali
i
will
translate
illustration
the
rosemonde
of
schubert
and
what
that
rosemonde
said
she
rosemonde
was
a
princess
of
cyprus
matemoiselle
and
cyprus
is
an
island
ah
and
schubert
then
where
that
schubert
is
not
an
island
matemoiselle
schubert
was
a
compatriot
of
mine
and
made
music
and
played
the
piano
just
like
me
ah
schubert
was
a
then
do
know
him
never
heard
his
name
that
is
a
pity
matemoiselle
he
had
some
talent
you
like
this
better
perhaps
and
he
strummed
messieurs
les

la
chaumière
pour
y
danser
le
cancan
striking
wrong
notes
and
banging
out
a
bass
in
a
different
key
a
hideously
grotesque
performance
yes
i
like
that
better
it
gayer
you
know
is
that
also
composed
by
a
compatriot
of
yours
asked
the
lady
heaven
forbid
matemoiselle
and
the
laugh
was
against
svengali
but
the
real
fun
of
it
all
if
there
was
any
lay
in
the
fact
that
she
was
perfectly
sincere
are
you
fond
of
music
asked
little
billee
oh
ai
i
just
she
replied
my
father
sang
like
a
bird
he
was
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
my
father
was
his
name
was
patrick
michael
fellow
of
trinity
cambridge
he
used
to
sing

do
you

a
very
pretty
song

said

i
oh
certainly
if
you
will
be
so
kind
miss
threw
away
the
end
of
her
cigarette
put
her
hands
on
her
knees
as
she
sat
on
the
and
sticking
her
elbows
well
out
she
looked
up
to
the
ceiling
with
a
tender
sentimental
smile
and
sang
the
touching
song
oh
do
you
remember
sweet
alice
ben
bolt
sweet
alice
with
hair
so
brown
etc
as
some
things
are
too
sad
and
too
deep
for
tears
so
some
things
are
too
grotesque
and
too
funny
for
laughter
of
such
a
kind
was
miss
performance
of
ben
bolt
from
that
capacious
mouth
and
through
that
bony
nose
there
rolled
a
volume
of
breathy
sound
not
loud
but
so
immense
that
it
seemed
to
come
from
all
round
to
be
reverberated
from
every
surface
in
the
studio
she
followed
more
or
less
the
shape
of
the
tune
going
up
when
it
rose
and
down
when
it
fell
but
with
such
immense
intervals
between
the
notes
as
were
never
dreamed
of
in
any
mortal
melody
it
was
as
though
she
could
never
once
have
deviated
into
tune
never
once
have
hit
upon
a
true
note
even
by
a
fluke
in
fact
as
though
she
were
absolutely
and
without
ear
although
she
stuck
to
the
time
correctly
enough
she
finished
her
song
amid
an
embarrassing
silence
the
audience
quite
know
whether
it
were
meant
for
fun
or
seriously
one
wondered
if
she
were
not
paying
out
svengali
for
his
impertinent
performance
of
messieurs
les
étudiants
if
so
it
was
a
capital
piece
of
impromptu
admirably
acted
and
a
very
ugly
gleam
yellowed
the
tawny
black
of
svengali
big
eyes
he
was
so
fond
of
making
fun
of
others
that
he
particularly
resented
being
made
fun
of
himself
could
endure
that
any
one
should
ever
have
the
laugh
of
at
length
little
billee
said
thank
you
so
much
it
is
a
capital
song
yes
said
miss
it
the
only
song
i
know
unfortunately
my
father
used
to
sing
it
just
like
that
when
he
felt
jolly
after
hot
rum
and
water
it
used
to
make
people
cry
he
used
to
cry
over
it
himself
never
do
some
people
think
i
ca
sing
a
bit
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
often
had
to
sing
it
six
or
seven
times
running
in
of
studios
i
vary
it
you
know
not
the
words
but
the
tune
you
must
remember
that
i
only
taken
to
it
lately
do
you
know
litolff
well
he
a
great
composer
and
he
came
to
durien
the
other
day
and
i
sang
bolt
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
why
he
said
madame
alboni
could
go
nearly
so
high
or
so
low
as
i
did
and
that
her
voice
was
half
so
strong
he
gave
me
his
word
of
honor
he
said
i
breathed
as
natural
and
straight
as
a
baby
and
all
i
want
is
to
get
my
voice
a
little
more
under
control
that
what
said
dit
asked
svengali
and
she
said
it
all
over
again
to
him
in
french
quite
french
french
of
the
most
colloquial
kind
her
accent
was
not
that
of
the
comédie
française
nor
yet
that
of
the
faubourg
germain
nor
yet
that
of
the
pavement
it
was
quaint
and
expressive
funny
without
being
vulgar
barpleu
he
was
right
litolff
said
svengali
i
assure
you
matemoiselle
that
i
have
never
heard
a
voice
that
can
equal
yours
you
have
a
talent
quite
exceptional
she
blushed
with
pleasure
and
the
others
thought
him
a
beastly
cad
for
poking
fun
at
the
poor
girl
in
such
a
way
and
they
thought
monsieur
litolff
another
she
then
got
up
and
shook
the
crumbs
off
her
coat
and
slipped
her
feet
into
durien
slippers
saying
in
english
well
i
got
to
go
back
life
ai
all
beer
and
skittles
and
more
the
pity
but
what
the
odds
so
long
as
you
happy
on
her
way
out
she
stopped
before
taffy
picture
a
chiffonnier
with
his
lantern
bending
over
a
dust
heap
for
taffy
was
or
thought
himself
a
passionate
realist
in
those
days
he
has
changed
and
now
paints
nothing
but
king
arthurs
and
guineveres
and
lancelots
and
elaines
and
floating
ladies
of
shalott
that
chiffonnier
basket
is
hitched
high
enough
she
remarked
how
could
he
tap
his
pick
against
the
rim
and
make
the
rag
fall
into
it
if
it
hitched
only
up
his
back
and
he
got
the
wrong
sabots
and
the
wrong
lantern
it
wrong
dear
me
said
taffy
turning
very
red
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
it
it
a
pity
you
do
paint
yourself
ah
now
you
cross
said
miss
oh
maïe
aïe
she
went
to
the
door
and
paused
looking
round
benignly
what
nice
teeth
you
all
three
got
that
because
you
englishmen
i
suppose
and
clean
them
twice
a
day
i
do
too
trilby
that
my
name
rue
des
pose
pour
quand
ça
ville
et
fait
tout
ce
qui
concerne
son
état
do
forget
thanks
all
and
en
une
orichinale
said
svengali
i
think
she
lovely
said
little
billee
the
young
and
tender
oh
heavens
what
angel
feet
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
she
sits
for
the
figure
i
sure
she
quite
a
lady
and
in
five
minutes
or
so
with
the
point
of
an
old
compass
he
scratched
in
white
on
the
dark
red
wall
a
profile
outline
of
trilby
left
foot
which
was
perhaps
the
more
perfect
poem
of
the
two
slight
as
it
was
this
little
piece
of
impromptu
etching
in
its
sense
of
beauty
in
its
quick
seizing
of
a
peculiar
individuality
its
subtle
rendering
of
a
strongly
received
impression
was
already
the
work
of
a
master
it
was
trilby
foot
and
nobody
else
nor
could
have
been
and
nobody
else
but
little
billee
could
have
drawn
it
in
just
that
inspired
way
que
bolt
inquired
gecko
upon
which
little
billee
was
made
by
taffy
to
sit
down
to
the
piano
and
sing
it
he
sang
it
very
nicely
with
his
pleasant
little
throaty
english
barytone
illustration
trilby
left
foot
it
was
solely
in
order
that
little
billee
should
have
opportunities
of
practising
this
graceful
accomplishment
of
his
for
his
own
and
his
friends
delectation
that
the
piano
had
been
sent
over
from
london
at
great
cost
to
taffy
and
the
laird
it
had
belonged
to
taffy
mother
who
was
dead
before
he
had
finished
the
second
verse
svengali
exclaimed
mais
chentil
allons
gecko
ça
and
he
put
his
big
hands
on
the
piano
over
little
billee
pushed
him
off
the
with
his
great
gaunt
body
and
sitting
on
it
himself
he
played
a
masterly
prelude
it
was
impressive
to
hear
the
complicated
richness
and
volume
of
the
sounds
he
evoked
after
little
billee
gentle
and
gecko
cuddling
lovingly
his
violin
and
closing
his
upturned
eyes
played
that
simple
melody
as
it
had
probably
never
been
played
before
such
passion
such
pathos
such
a
tone
and
they
turned
it
and
twisted
it
and
went
from
one
key
to
another
playing
into
each
hands
svengali
taking
the
lead
and
fugued
and
canoned
and
counterpointed
and
and
shuttlecocked
it
high
and
low
soft
and
loud
in
minor
in
pizzicato
and
in
sordino
adagio
andante
allegretto
scherzo
and
exhausted
all
its
possibilities
of
beauty
till
their
susceptible
audience
of
three
was
all
but
crazed
with
delight
and
wonder
and
the
masterful
ben
bolt
and
his
alice
and
his
too
submissive
friend
and
his
old
schoolmaster
so
kind
and
so
true
and
his
schoolmates
and
the
rustic
porch
and
the
mill
and
the
slab
of
granite
so
gray
and
the
dear
little
nook
by
the
clear
running
brook
were
all
magnified
into
a
strange
almost
holy
poetic
dignity
and
splendor
quite
undreamed
of
by
whoever
wrote
the
words
and
music
of
that
unsophisticated
little
song
which
has
touched
so
many
simple
british
hearts
that
do
know
any
better
and
among
them
once
that
of
the
present
scribe
long
long
ago
sacrepleu
il
choue
pien
le
checko
hein
said
svengali
when
they
had
brought
this
wonderful
double
improvisation
to
a
climax
and
a
close
mon
élèfe
che
le
fais
chanter
sur
son
fiolon
comme
si
qui
chantais
ach
si
pour
teux
sous
de
voix
che
serais
le
bremier
chanteur
du
monte
i
can
not
sing
he
continued
i
will
translate
him
into
english
without
attempting
to
translate
his
accent
which
is
a
mere
matter
of
judiciously
transposing
p
and
b
and
t
and
d
and
f
and
v
and
g
and
k
and
turning
the
soft
french
j
into
sch
and
a
pretty
language
into
an
ugly
one
i
can
not
sing
myself
i
can
not
play
the
violin
but
i
can
teach
hein
gecko
and
i
have
a
pupil
hein
gecko
la
betite
honorine
and
here
he
leered
all
round
with
a
leer
that
was
not
engaging
the
world
shall
hear
of
la
betite
honorine
some
day
hein
gecko
listen
all
this
is
how
i
teach
la
betite
honorine
gecko
play
me
a
little
accompaniment
in
pizzicato
and
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
kind
of
little
flexible
flageolet
of
his
own
invention
it
seems
which
he
screwed
together
and
put
to
his
lips
and
on
this
humble
instrument
he
played
ben
bolt
while
gecko
accompanied
him
using
his
fiddle
as
a
guitar
his
adoring
eyes
fixed
in
reverence
on
his
master
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
render
in
any
words
the
deftness
the
distinction
the
grace
power
pathos
and
passion
with
which
this
truly
phenomenal
artist
executed
the
poor
old
twopenny
tune
on
his
elastic
penny
whistle
for
it
was
little
more
such
thrilling
vibrating
piercing
tenderness
now
loud
and
full
a
shrill
scream
of
anguish
now
soft
as
a
whisper
a
mere
melodic
breath
more
human
almost
than
the
human
voice
itself
a
perfection
unattainable
even
by
gecko
a
master
on
an
instrument
which
is
the
acknowledged
king
of
all
so
that
the
tear
which
had
been
so
close
to
the
brink
of
little
eye
while
gecko
was
playing
now
rose
and
trembled
under
his
eyelid
and
spilled
itself
down
his
nose
and
he
had
to
dissemble
and
surreptitiously
mop
it
up
with
his
little
finger
as
he
leaned
his
chin
on
his
hand
and
cough
a
little
husky
unnatural
cough
se
donner
une
he
had
never
heard
such
music
as
this
never
dreamed
such
music
was
possible
he
was
conscious
while
it
lasted
that
he
saw
deeper
into
the
beauty
the
sadness
of
things
the
very
heart
of
them
and
their
pathetic
evanescence
as
with
a
new
inner
eye
even
into
eternity
itself
beyond
the
veil
a
vague
cosmic
vision
that
faded
when
the
music
was
over
but
left
an
unfading
reminiscence
of
its
having
been
and
a
passionate
desire
to
express
the
like
some
day
through
the
plastic
medium
of
his
own
beautiful
art
illustration
the
flexible
flageolet
when
svengali
ended
he
leered
again
on
his
audience
and
said
that
is
how
i
teach
la
betite
honorine
to
sing
that
is
how
i
teach
gecko
to
play
that
is
how
i
teach
bel
it
was
lost
the
bel
canto
but
i
found
it
in
a
dream
i
and
nobody
else
i
svengali
i
i
but
that
is
enough
of
music
let
us
play
at
something
else
let
us
play
at
this
he
cried
jumping
up
and
seizing
a
foil
and
bending
it
against
the
wall
come
along
little
pillee
and
i
will
show
you
something
more
you
do
know
so
little
billee
took
off
coat
and
waistcoat
donned
mask
and
glove
and
and
they
had
an
assault
of
arms
as
it
is
nobly
called
in
french
and
in
which
poor
little
billee
came
off
very
badly
the
german
pole
fenced
wildly
but
well
then
it
was
the
laird
turn
and
he
came
off
badly
too
so
then
taffy
took
up
the
foil
and
redeemed
the
honor
of
great
britain
as
became
a
british
hussar
and
a
man
of
blood
for
taffy
by
long
and
assiduous
practice
in
the
best
school
in
paris
and
also
by
virtue
of
his
native
aptitudes
was
a
match
for
any
maître
in
the
whole
french
army
and
svengali
got
what
for
and
when
it
was
time
to
give
up
play
and
settle
down
to
work
others
dropped
in
french
english
swiss
german
american
greek
curtains
were
drawn
and
shutters
opened
the
studio
was
flooded
with
light
and
the
afternoon
was
healthily
spent
in
athletic
and
gymnastic
exercises
till
but
little
billee
who
had
had
enough
of
fencing
and
gymnastics
for
the
day
amused
himself
by
filling
up
with
black
and
white
and
red
the
outline
of
trilby
foot
on
the
wall
lest
he
should
forget
his
fresh
vision
of
it
which
was
still
to
him
as
the
thing
itself
an
absolute
reality
born
of
a
mere
glance
a
mere
chance
durien
came
in
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
exclaimed
tiens
le
pied
de
trilby
vous
avez
fait
ça
nature
nong
de
mémoire
alors
wee
je
vous
en
fais
mon
compliment
vous
avez
eu
la
main
heureuse
je
voudrais
bien
avoir
fait
ça
moi
un
petit
que
vous
avez
fait
là
tout
bonnement
mon
cher
mais
vous
élaborez
trop
de
grâce
touchez
plus
and
little
billee
was
pleased
and
touched
it
no
more
for
durien
was
a
great
sculptor
and
sincerity
itself
and
then
well
i
happen
to
forget
what
sort
of
day
this
particular
day
turned
into
at
about
six
of
the
clock
if
it
was
decently
fine
the
most
of
them
went
off
to
dine
at
the
restaurant
de
la
couronne
kept
by
the
père
trin
in
the
rue
de
monsieur
who
gave
you
of
his
best
to
eat
and
drink
for
twenty
sols
parisis
or
one
franc
in
the
coin
of
the
empire
good
distending
soups
omelets
that
were
only
too
savory
lentils
red
and
white
beans
meat
so
dressed
and
sauced
and
seasoned
that
you
did
know
whether
it
were
beef
or
mutton
flesh
fowl
or
good
red
herring
or
even
bad
for
that
matter
nor
very
greatly
care
and
just
the
same
lettuce
radishes
and
cheese
of
gruyère
or
brie
as
you
got
at
the
trois
frères
provençaux
but
not
the
same
butter
and
to
wash
it
all
down
generous
wine
in
wooden
brocs
that
stained
a
lovely
æsthetic
blue
everything
it
was
spilled
over
illustration
the
bridge
of
arts
and
you
hobnobbed
with
models
male
and
female
students
of
law
and
medicine
painters
and
sculptors
workmen
and
blanchisseuses
and
grisettes
and
found
them
very
good
company
and
most
improving
to
your
french
if
your
french
was
of
the
usual
british
kind
and
even
to
some
of
your
manners
if
these
were
very
british
indeed
and
the
evening
was
innocently
wound
up
with
billiards
cards
or
dominos
at
the
café
du
luxembourg
opposite
or
at
the
théâtre
du
luxembourg
in
the
rue
de
madame
to
see
funny
farces
with
screamingly
droll
englishmen
in
them
or
still
better
at
the
jardin
bullier
la
closerie
des
lilas
to
see
the
students
dance
the
cancan
or
try
and
dance
it
yourself
which
is
not
so
easy
as
it
seems
or
best
of
all
at
the
théâtre
de
to
see
some
piece
of
classical
or
if
it
were
not
only
fine
but
a
saturday
afternoon
into
the
bargain
the
laird
would
put
on
a
necktie
and
a
few
other
necessary
things
and
the
three
friends
would
walk
arm
in
arm
to
taffy
hotel
in
the
rue
de
seine
and
wait
outside
till
he
had
made
himself
as
presentable
as
the
laird
which
did
not
take
very
long
and
then
little
billee
was
always
presentable
they
would
arm
in
arm
the
huge
taffy
in
the
middle
descend
the
rue
de
seine
and
cross
a
bridge
to
the
cité
and
have
a
look
in
at
the
morgue
then
back
again
to
the
quays
on
the
rive
gauche
by
the
pont
neuf
to
wend
their
way
westward
now
on
one
side
to
look
at
the
print
and
picture
shops
and
the
magasins
of
and
haply
sometimes
buy
thereof
now
on
the
other
to
finger
and
cheapen
the
books
for
sale
on
the
parapet
and
even
pick
up
one
or
two
utterly
unwanted
bargains
never
to
be
read
or
opened
again
when
they
reached
the
pont
des
arts
they
would
cross
it
stopping
in
the
middle
to
look
up
the
river
towards
the
old
cité
and
notre
dame
eastward
and
dream
unutterable
things
and
try
to
utter
them
then
turning
westward
they
would
gaze
at
the
glowing
sky
and
all
it
glowed
upon
the
corner
of
the
tuileries
and
the
louvre
the
many
bridges
the
chamber
of
deputies
the
golden
river
narrowing
its
perspective
and
broadening
its
bed
as
it
went
flowing
and
winding
on
its
way
between
passy
and
grenelle
to
st
cloud
to
rouen
to
the
havre
to
england
perhaps
where
did
want
to
be
just
then
and
they
would
try
and
express
themselves
to
the
effect
that
life
was
uncommonly
well
worth
living
in
that
particular
city
at
that
particular
time
of
the
day
and
year
and
century
at
that
particular
epoch
of
their
own
mortal
and
uncertain
lives
then
still
arm
in
arm
and
chatting
gayly
across
the
of
the
louvre
through
gilded
gates
well
guarded
by
reckless
imperial
zouaves
up
the
arcaded
rue
de
rivoli
as
far
as
the
rue
castiglione
where
they
would
stare
with
greedy
eyes
at
the
window
of
the
great
corner
and
marvel
at
the
beautiful
assortment
of
bonbons
pralines
dragées
marrons
glacés
saccharine
crystalline
substances
of
all
kinds
and
colors
as
charming
to
look
at
as
an
illumination
precious
stones
delicately
frosted
sweets
pearls
and
diamonds
so
arranged
as
to
melt
in
the
mouth
especially
at
this
particular
time
of
the
year
the
monstrous
of
enchanting
hue
enshrined
like
costly
jewels
in
caskets
of
satin
and
gold
and
the
laird
who
was
well
read
in
his
english
classics
and
liked
to
show
it
would
opine
that
they
managed
these
things
better
in
france
then
across
the
street
by
a
great
gate
into
the
allée
des
feuillants
and
up
to
the
place
de
la
concorde
to
gaze
but
quite
without
base
envy
at
the
smart
people
coming
back
from
the
bois
de
boulogne
for
even
in
paris
carriage
people
have
a
way
of
looking
bored
of
taking
their
pleasure
sadly
of
having
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
as
though
the
vibration
of
so
many
wheels
all
rolling
home
the
same
way
every
afternoon
had
hypnotized
them
into
silence
idiocy
and
melancholia
and
our
three
musketeers
of
the
brush
would
speculate
on
the
vanity
of
wealth
and
rank
and
fashion
on
the
satiety
that
follows
in
the
wake
of
and
overtakes
it
on
the
weariness
of
the
pleasures
that
become
a
toil
as
if
they
knew
all
about
it
had
found
it
all
out
for
themselves
and
nobody
else
had
ever
found
it
out
before
then
they
found
out
something
else
namely
that
the
sting
of
healthy
appetite
was
becoming
intolerable
so
they
would
betake
themselves
to
an
english
in
the
rue
de
la
madeleine
on
the
side
near
the
top
where
they
would
renovate
their
strength
and
their
patriotism
on
british
beef
and
beer
and
household
bread
and
bracing
biting
stinging
yellow
mustard
and
horseradish
and
noble
and
cheshire
cheese
and
get
through
as
much
of
these
in
an
hour
or
so
as
they
could
for
talking
talking
talking
such
happy
talk
as
full
of
sanguine
hope
and
enthusiasm
of
cocksure
commendation
or
condemnation
of
all
painters
dead
or
alive
of
modest
but
firm
belief
in
themselves
and
each
other
as
a
paris
is
full
of
sweets
and
pleasantness
for
the
young
and
then
a
stroll
on
the
crowded
boulevards
and
a
bock
at
the
café
there
at
a
little
marble
table
right
out
on
the
genial
asphalt
pavement
still
talking
nineteen
to
the
dozen
then
home
by
dark
old
silent
streets
and
some
deserted
bridge
to
their
beloved
latin
quarter
the
morgue
gleaming
cold
and
still
and
fatal
in
the
pale
lamplight
and
notre
dame
pricking
up
its
watchful
twin
towers
which
have
looked
down
for
so
many
centuries
on
so
many
happy
sanguine
expansive
youths
walking
arm
in
arm
by
twos
and
threes
and
forever
talking
talking
talking
the
laird
and
little
billee
would
see
taffy
safe
to
the
door
of
his
hôtel
garni
in
the
rue
de
seine
where
they
would
find
much
to
say
to
each
other
before
they
said
so
much
that
taffy
and
little
billee
would
see
the
laird
safe
to
door
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
and
then
a
discussion
would
arise
between
taffy
and
the
laird
on
the
immortality
of
the
soul
let
us
say
or
the
exact
meaning
of
the
word
gentleman
or
the
relative
merits
of
dickens
and
thackeray
or
some
such
recondite
and
quite
unhackneyed
theme
and
taffy
and
the
laird
would
escort
little
billee
to
door
in
the
place
de

he
would
them
both
back
again
and
so
on
till
any
hour

again

it
rained
and
paris
through

loomed
with
its

slate

that
were

and
sober

west
wind
made
woful
music
among

little
gray
waves
ran
up

river
the
wrong
way
and
the
morgue
looked
chill
and
dark
and
wet
and
almost
uninviting
even
to
three
young
britons
they
would
resolve
to

spend

happy
evening

taking
with

a

or
so
of
crusty
new
bread
well
burned

flat
side

fillet
of
beef
a

would

rubbed
on

of
bread

flavor

with
taffy
would
lay
the
cloth
englishwise
and
also
make
the
salad
for
which
like
everybody
else
i
ever
met
he
had
a
special
receipt
of
his
own
putting
in
the
oil
first
and
the
vinegar
after
and
indeed
his
salads
were
quite
as
good
as
everybody
else
the
laird
bending
over
the
stove
would
cook
the
onions
and
beef
into
a
savory
scotch
mess
so
cunningly
that
you
could
not
taste
the
beef
for
the
onions
nor
always
the
onions
for
the
garlic
and
they
would
dine
far
better
than
at
le

better
than
at

no
little
billee
had
never
known
such
happiness
as
this
never
even
dreamed
of
its
possibility
a
day
or
two
after
this
our
opening
day
but
in
the
afternoon
when
the
fencing
and
boxing
had
begun
and
the
trapeze
was
in
full
swing
milk
below
was
sounded
at
the
door
and
she
appeared
clothed
this
time
in
her
right
mind
as
it
seemed
a
tall
straight
young
grisette
in
a
snowy
frilled
cap
a
neat
black
gown
and
white
apron
pretty
faded
brown
stockings
and
soft
gray
slippers
of
list
without
heels
and
originally
shapeless
but
which
her
feet
uncompromising
and
inexorable
as
had
ennobled
into
everlasting
classic
shapeliness
and
stamped
with
an
unforgettable
individuality
as
does
a
beautiful
hand
its
glove
a
fact
little
billee
was
not
slow
to
perceive
with
a
curious
conscious
thrill
that
was
only
half
æsthetic
then
he
looked
into
her
freckled
face
and
met
the
kind
and
tender
mirthfulness
of
her
gaze
and
the
plucky
frankness
of
her
fine
wide
smile
with
a
thrill
that
was
not
æsthetic
at
all
nor
the
reverse
but
all
of
the
heart
and
in
one
of
his
quick
flashes
of
intuitive
insight
he
divined
far
down
beneath
the
shining
surface
of
those
eyes
which
seemed
for
a
moment
to
reflect
only
a
little
image
of
himself
against
the
sky
beyond
the
big
north
window
a
well
of
sweetness
and
floating
somewhere
in
the
midst
of
it
the
very
heart
of
compassion
generosity
and
warm
sisterly
love
and
under
that
alas
at
the
bottom
of
all
a
thin
slimy
layer
of
sorrow
and
shame
and
just
as
long
as
it
takes
for
a
tear
to
rise
and
gather
and
choke
itself
back
again
this
sudden
revelation
shook
his
nervous
little
frame
with
a
pang
of
pity
and
the
knightly
wish
to
help
but
he
had
no
time
to
indulge
in
such
soft
emotions

heart
sluices
had
closed
during
this
interchange
of

he
felt
it
to
be
of
a
very
slangy
kind
because
he
understand
a
word
of
it
and
he
hated
slang
all
he
could
make
out
was
the
free
use
of
the

the

he
knew
enough
french
to
know
that
this
implied
a
great
familiarity

it

that
she
should
retrieve
her
fallen
fortunes

little
amenities
which

dine
with
him
au
cabaret
and
share
his
box
so
trilby
did
go
to
the
austrian
embassy
after
all
as
the
laird
observed
to
little
billee
with
such
a
good
imitation
of
her
wink
that
little
billee
was
bound
to
laugh
but
little
billee
was
not
inclined
for
fun
a
dulness
a
sense
of
disenchantment
had
come
over
him
as
he
expressed
it
to
himself
with
pathetic
a
feeling
of
sadness
and
longing
that
is
not
akin
to
pain
and
resembles
sorrow
only
as
the
mist
resembles
the
rain
and
the
sadness
if
he
had
known
was
that
all
beautiful
young
women
with
kind
sweet
faces
and
noble
figures
and
extremities
should
not
be
good
and
pure
as
they
were
beautiful
and
the
longing
was
a
longing
that
trilby
could
be
turned
into
a
young
lady
say
the
daughter
in
a
little
devonshire
village
his
sister
friend
and
at
the
a
simple
pure
and
pious
maiden
of
gentle
birth
for
he
adored
piety
in
woman
although
he
was
not
pious
by
any
means
his
inarticulate
intuitive
perceptions
were
not
of
form
and
color
secrets
only
but
strove
to
pierce
the
veil
of
deeper
mysteries
in
impetuous
and
dogmatic
boyish
scorn
of
all
received
interpretations
for
he
flattered
himself
that
he
possessed
the
philosophical
and
scientific
mind
and
piqued
himself
on
thinking
clearly
and
was
intolerant
of
human
inconsistency
that
small
reserve
portion
of
his
brain
which
should
have
lain
fallow
while
the
rest
of
it
was
at
work
or
play
perpetually
plagued
itself
about
the
mysteries
of
life
and
death
and
was
forever
propounding
unanswerable
arguments
against
the
christian
belief
through
a
kind
of
inverted
sympathy
with
the
believer
fortunately
for
his
friends
little
billee
was
both
shy
and
discreet
and
very
tender
of
other
people
feelings
so
he
kept
all
his
immature
juvenile
agnosticism
to
himself
to
atone
for
such
ungainly
in
one
so
young
and
tender
he
was
the
slave
of
many
little
traditional
observances
which
have
no
very
solid
foundation
in
either
science
or
philosophy
for
instance
he
would
walk
under
a
ladder
for
worlds
nor
sit
down
thirteen
to
dinner
nor
have
his
hair
cut
on
a
friday
and
was
quite
upset
if
he
happened
to
see
the
new
moon
through
glass
and
he
believed
in
lucky
and
unlucky
numbers
and
dearly
loved
the
sights
and
scents
and
sounds
of
in
some
dim
old
french
cathedral
and
found
them
secretly
comforting
let
us
hope
that
he
sometimes
laughed
at
himself
if
only
in
his
sleeve
and
with
all
his
keenness
of
insight
into
life
he
had
a
young
englishman
belief
in
the
infallible
efficacy
of
gentle
birth
for
gentle
he
considered
his
own
and
taffy
and
the
laird
and
that
of
most
of
the
good
people
he
had
lived
among
in
england
all
people
in
short
whose
two
parents
and
four
grandparents
had
received
a
liberal
education
and
belonged
to
the
professional
class
and
with
this
belief
he
combined
or
thought
he
did
a
proper
democratic
scorn
for
bloated
dukes
and
lords
and
even
poor
inoffensive
baronets
and
all
the
landed
gentry
everybody
who
was
born
an
inch
higher
up
than
himself
it
is
a
fairly
good
social
creed
if
you
can
only
stick
to
it
through
life
in
despite
of
life
experience
it
fosters
independence
and
and
not
a
few
stodgy
practical
virtues
as
well
at
all
events
it
keeps
you
out
of
bad
company
which
is
to
be
found
both
above
and
below
and
all
this
melancholy
preoccupation
on
little
billee
part
from
the
momentary
gleam
and
dazzle
of
a
pair
of
feet
in
an
eye
too
much
enamoured
of
mere
form
reversing
the
usual
process
he
had
idealized
from
the
base
upward
many
of
us
older
and
wiser
than
little
billee
have
seen
in
lovely
female
shapes
the
outer
garment
of
a
lovely
female
soul
the
instinct
which
guides
us
to
do
this
is
perhaps
a
right
one
more
often
than
not
but
more
often
than
not
also
lovely
female
shapes
are
terrible
complicators
of
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
this
earthly
life
especially
for
their
owner
and
more
especially
if
she
be
a
humble
daughter
of
the
people
poor
and
ignorant
of
a
yielding
nature
too
quick
to
love
and
trust
this
is
all
so
true
as
to
be
trite
so
trite
as
to
be
a
common
platitude
a
modern
teller
of
tales
most
widely
and
most
justly
popular
tells
us
of
heroes
and
heroines
who
like
lord
byron
corsair
were
linked
with
one
virtue
and
a
thousand
crimes
and
so
dexterously
does
he
weave
his
story
that
the
young
person
may
read
it
and
learn
nothing
but
good
my
poor
heroine
was
the
converse
of
these
engaging
criminals
she
had
all
the
virtues
but
one
but
the
virtue
she
lacked
the
very
one
of
all
that
plays
the
and
gives
its
generic
name
to
all
the
rest
of
that
goodly
company
was
of
such
a
kind
that
i
have
found
it
impossible
so
to
tell
her
history
as
to
make
it
quite
fit
and
proper
reading
for
the
ubiquitous
young
person
so
dear
to
us
all
most
deeply
to
my
regret
for
i
had
fondly
hoped
it
might
one
day
be
said
of
me
that
whatever
my
other
literary
shortcomings
might
be
i
at
least
had
never
penned
a
line
which
a
young
british
mother
might
not
read
aloud
to
her
little
babe
as
it
lies
sucking
its
little
bottle
in
its
little
bassinet
fate
has
willed
it
otherwise
would
indeed
that
i
could
duly
express
poor
trilby
one
shortcoming
in
some
not
too
familiar
medium
in
latin
or
greek
let
us
say
lest
the
young
person
in
this
ubiquitousness
of
hers
for
which
heaven
be
praised
should
happen
to
pry
into
these
pages
when
her
mother
is
looking
another
way
latin
and
greek
are
languages
the
young
person
should
not
be
taught
to
understand
seeing
that
they
are
highly
improper
languages
deservedly
dead
in
which
pagan
bards
who
should
have
known
better
have
sung
the
filthy
loves
of
their
gods
and
goddesses
but
at
least
am
i
scholar
enough
to
enter
one
little
latin
plea
on
trilby
behalf
the
shortest
best
and
most
beautiful
plea
i
can
think
of
it
was
once
used
in
extenuation
and
condonation
of
the
frailties
of
another
poor
weak
woman
presumably
beautiful
and
a
far
worse
offender
than
trilby
but
who
like
trilby
repented
of
her
ways
and
was
most
justly
forgiven
quia
multum
amavit
illustration
trilby
forebears
whether
it
be
an
aggravation
of
her
misdeeds
or
an
extenuating
circumstance
no
pressure
of
want
no
temptations
of
greed
or
vanity
had
ever
been
factors
in
urging
trilby
on
her
downward
career
after
her
first
false
step
in
that
direction
the
result
of
ignorance
bad
advice
from
her
mother
of
all
people
in
the
world
and
base
betrayal
she
might
have
lived
in
guilty
splendor
had
she
chosen
but
her
wants
were
few
she
had
no
vanity
and
her
tastes
were
of
the
simplest
and
she
earned
enough
to
gratify
them
all
and
to
spare
so
she
followed
love
for
love
sake
only
now
and
then
as
she
would
have
followed
art
if
she
had
been
a
man
capriciously
desultorily
more
in
a
frolicsome
spirit
of
camaraderie
than
anything
else
like
an
amateur
in
short
a
distinguished
amateur
who
is
too
proud
to
sell
his
pictures
but
willingly
gives
one
away
now
and
then
to
some
highly
valued
and
much
admiring
friend
sheer
gayety
of
heart
and
genial
the
difficulty
of
saying
nay
to
earnest
pleading
she
was
bonne
camarade
et
bonne
fille
before
everything
though
her
heart
was
not
large
enough
to
harbor
more
than
one
light
love
at
a
time
even
in
that
latin
quarter
of
genially
capacious
hearts
it
had
room
for
many
warm
friendships
and
she
was
the
warmest
most
helpful
and
most
compassionate
of
friends
far
more
serious
and
faithful
in
friendship
than
in
love
indeed
she
might
almost
be
said
to
possess
a
virginal
heart
so
little
did
she
know
of
love
heartaches
and
raptures
and
torments
and
clingings
and
jealousies
with
her
it
was
lightly
come
and
lightly
go
and
never
come
back
again
as
one
or
two
or
perhaps
three
picturesque
bohemians
of
the
brush
or
chisel
had
found
at
some
cost
to
their
vanity
and
perhaps
even
to
a
deeper
feeling
who
knows
trilby
father
as
she
had
said
had
been
a
gentleman
the
son
of
a
famous
dublin
physician
and
friend
of
george
the
fourth
he
had
been
a
fellow
of
his
college
and
had
entered
holy
orders
he
also
had
all
the
virtues
but
one
he
was
a
drunkard
and
began
to
drink
quite
early
in
life
he
soon
left
the
church
and
became
a
classical
tutor
and
failed
through
this
besetting
sin
of
his
and
fell
into
disgrace
then
he
went
to
paris
and
picked
up
a
few
english
pupils
there
and
lost
them
and
earned
a
precarious
livelihood
from
hand
to
mouth
anyhow
and
sank
from
bad
to
worse
and
when
his
worst
was
about
reached
he
married
the
famous
tartaned
and
tamoshantered
at
the
montagnards
écossais
in
the
rue
du
paradis
poissonnière
a
very
fishy
paradise
indeed
she
was
a
most
beautiful
highland
lassie
of
low
degree
and
she
managed
to
support
him
or
helped
him
to
support
himself
for
ten
or
fifteen
years
trilby
was
born
to
them
and
was
dragged
up
in
some
way
la
grâce
de
dieu
patrick
soon
taught
his
wife
to
drown
all
care
and
responsibility
in
his
own
simple
way
and
opportunities
for
doing
so
were
never
lacking
to
her
then
he
died
and
left
a
posthumous
child
born
ten
months
after
his
death
alas
and
whose
birth
cost
its
mother
her
life
then
trilby
became
a
de
and
in
two
or
three
years
came
to
grief
through
her
trust
in
a
friend
of
her
mother
then
she
became
a
model
besides
and
was
able
to
support
her
little
brother
whom
she
dearly
loved
at
the
time
this
story
begins
this
small
waif
and
stray
was
en
pension
with
le
père
martin
the
and
his
wife
the
dealer
in
and
inexpensive
old
masters
they
were
very
good
people
and
had
grown
fond
of
the
child
who
was
beautiful
to
look
at
and
full
of
pretty
tricks
and
pluck
and
cleverness
a
popular
favorite
in
the
rue
du
puits
and
its
humble
neighborhood
trilby
for
some
freak
always
chose
to
speak
of
him
as
her
godson
and
as
the
grandchild
of
le
père
et
la
mère
martin
so
that
these
good
people
had
almost
grown
to
believe
he
really
belonged
to
them
and
almost
every
one
else
believed
that
he
was
the
child
of
trilby
in
spite
of
her
youth
and
she
was
so
fond
of
him
that
she
did
mind
in
the
least
he
might
have
had
a
worse
home
la
mère
martin
was
pious
or
pretended
to
be
le
père
martin
was
the
reverse
but
they
were
equally
good
for
their
kind
and
though
coarse
and
ignorant
and
unscrupulous
in
many
ways
as
was
natural
enough
they
were
gifted
in
a
very
full
measure
with
the
saving
graces
of
love
and
charity
especially
he
and
if
people
are
to
be
judged
by
their
works
this
worthy
pair
are
no
doubt
both
equally
well
compensated
by
now
for
the
trials
and
struggles
of
their
sordid
earthly
life
so
much
for
trilby
parentage
and
as
she
sat
and
wept
at
madame
doche
impersonation
of
la
dame
aux
camélias
with
her
hand
in
durien
she
vaguely
remembered
as
in
a
waking
dream
now
the
noble
presence
of
taffy
as
he
towered
cool
and
erect
foil
in
hand
gallantly
waiting
for
his
adversary
to
breathe
now
the
beautiful
sensitive
face
of
little
billee
and
his
deferential
courtesy
and
during
the
her
heart
went
out
in
friendship
to
the
jolly
scotch
laird
of
cockpen
who
came
out
now
and
then
with
such
terrible
french
oaths
and
abominable
expletives
and
in
the
presence
of
ladies
too
without
the
slightest
notion
of
what
they
meant
for
the
laird
had
a
quick
ear
and
a
craving
to
be
colloquial
and
idiomatic
before
everything
else
and
made
many
awkward
and
embarrassing
mistakes
it
would
be
with
him
as
though
a
polite
frenchman
should
say
to
a
fair
daughter
of
albion
d
my

tell
that
good
old
of
a
jules
to
bring
you
another
cup
and
so
forth
till
time
and
experience
taught
him
better
it
is
perhaps
well
for
him
that
his
first
experiments
in
conversational
french
were
made
in
the
unconventional
circle
of
the

nobody
knew
exactly
how
svengali
lived
and
very
few
knew
where
or
why
he
occupied
a
roomy
dilapidated
garret
au
sixième
in
the
rue
with
a
and
a
for
furniture
and
very
little
else
he
was
poor
for
in
spite
of
his
talent
he
had
not
yet
made
his
mark
in
paris
his
manners
may
have
been
accountable
for
this
he
would
either
fawn
or
bully
and
could
be
grossly
impertinent
he
had
a
kind
of
cynical
humor
which
was
more
offensive
than
amusing
and
always
laughed
at
the
wrong
thing
at
the
wrong
time
in
the
wrong
place
and
his
laughter
was
always
derisive
and
full
of
malice
and
his
egotism
and
conceit
were
not
to
be
borne
and
then
he
was
both
tawdry
and
dirty
in
his
person
more
greasily
mattedly
unkempt
than
even
a
really
successful
pianist
has
any
right
to
be
even
in
the
best
society
he
was
not
a
nice
man
and
there
was
no
pathos
in
his
poverty
a
poverty
that
was
not
honorable
and
need
not
have
existed
at
all
for
he
was
constantly
receiving
supplies
from
his
own
people
in
austria
his
old
father
and
mother
his
sisters
his
cousins
and
his
aunts
frugal
folk
of
whom
he
was
the
pride
and
the
darling
he
had
but
one
virtue
his
love
of
his
art
or
rather
his
love
of
himself
as
a
master
of
his
art
master
for
he
despised
or
affected
to
despise
all
other
musicians
living
or
dead
even
those
whose
work
he
interpreted
so
divinely
and
pitied
them
for
not
hearing
svengali
give
utterance
to
their
music
which
of
course
they
could
not
utter
themselves

he
had
been
the
best
pianist
of
his
time
at
the
conservatory
in
leipsic
and
indeed
there
was
perhaps
some
excuse
for
this
overweening
conceit
since
he
was
able
to
lend
a
quite
peculiar
individual
charm
of
his
own
to
any
music
he
played
except
the
highest
and
best
of
all
in
which
he
conspicuously
failed
he
had
to
draw
the
line
just
above
chopin
where
he
reached
his
highest
level
it
will
not
do
to
lend
your
own
quite
peculiar
individual
charm
to
handel
and
bach
and
beethoven
and
chopin
is
not
bad
as
a
he
had
ardently
wished
to
sing
and
had
studied
hard
to
that
end
in
germany
in
italy
in
france
with
the
forlorn
hope
of
evolving
from
some
inner
recess
a
voice
to
sing
with
but
nature
had
been
singularly
harsh
to
him
in
this
one
respect
inexorable
he
was
absolutely
without
voice
beyond
the
harsh
hoarse
weak
raven
croak
he
used
to
speak
with
and
no
method
availed
to
make
one
for
him
but
he
grew
to
understand
the
human
voice
as
perhaps
no
one
has
understood
it
before
or
since
so
in
his
head
he
went
forever
singing
singing
singing
as
probably
no
human
nightingale
has
ever
yet
been
able
to
sing
out
loud
for
the
glory
and
delight
of
his
making
unheard
heavenly
melody
of
the
cheapest
trivialest
tunes
tunes
of
the
café
concert
tunes
of
the
nursery
the
the
the
the
pothouse
the
slum
there
was
nothing
so
humble
so
base
even
but
that
his
magic
could
transform
it
into
the
rarest
beauty
without
altering
a
note
this
seems
impossible
i
know
but
if
it
did
where
would
the
magic
come
in
whatever
of
heart
or
conscience
pity
love
tenderness
manliness
courage
reverence
charity
endowed
him
at
his
birth
had
been
swallowed
up
by
this
one
faculty
and
nothing
of
them
was
left
for
the
common
uses
of
life
he
poured
them
all
into
his
little
flexible
flageolet
svengali
playing
chopin
on
the
even
or
especially
svengali
playing
ben
bolt
on
that
penny
whistle
of
his
was
as
one
of
the
heavenly
host
illustration
as
bad
as
they
make
svengali
walking
up
and
down
the
earth
seeking
whom
he
might
cheat
betray
exploit
borrow
money
from
make
brutal
fun
of
bully
if
he
dared
cringe
to
if
he
must
man
woman
child
or
dog
was
about
as
bad
as
they
make
to
earn
a
few
pence
when
he
could
borrow
them
he
played
accompaniments
at
café
concerts
and
even
then
he
gave
offence
for
in
his
contempt
for
the
singer
he
would
play
too
loud
and
embroider
his
accompaniments
with
brilliant
improvisations
of
his
own
and
lift
his
hands
on
high
and
bring
them
down
with
a
bang
in
the
sentimental
parts
and
shake
his
dirty
mane
and
shrug
his
shoulders
and
smile
and
leer
at
the
audience
and
do
all
he
could
to
attract
their
attention
to
himself
he
also
gave
a
few
music
lessons
not
at
ladies
schools
let
us
hope
for
which
he
was
not
well
paid
presumably
since
he
was
always
without
the
sou
always
borrowing
money
that
he
never
paid
back
and
exhausting
the
pockets
and
the
patience
of
one
acquaintance
after
another
he
had
but
two
friends
there
was
gecko
who
lived
in
a
little
garret
close
by
in
the
impasse
des
ramoneurs
and
who
was
second
violin
in
the
orchestra
of
the
gymnase
and
shared
his
humble
earnings
with
his
master
to
whom
indeed
he
owed
his
great
talent
not
yet
revealed
to
the
world
svengali
other
friend
and
pupil
was
or
rather
had
been
the
mysterious
honorine
of
whose
conquest
he
was
much
given
to
boast
hinting
that
she
was
une
jeune
femme
du
monde
this
was
not
the
case
mademoiselle
honorine
cahen
better
known
in
the
quartier
latin
as
mimi
la
salope
was
a
dirty
drabby
little
of
a
jewess
a
model
for
the
figure
a
very
humble
person
indeed
socially
she
was
however
of
a
very
lively
disposition
and
had
a
charming
voice
and
a
natural
gift
of
singing
so
sweetly
that
you
forgot
her
accent
which
was
that
of
the
tout
ce
y
a
de
plus
canaille
she
used
to
sit
at
carrel
and
during
the
pose
she
would
sing
when
little
billee
first
heard
her
he
was
so
fascinated
that
it
made
him
sick
to
think
she
sat
for
the
figure
an
effect
that
was
always
produced
upon
him
by
all
specially
attractive
figure
models
of
the
gentler
sex
for
he
had
a
reverence
for
woman
and
before
everything
else
he
had
for
the
singing
woman
an
absolute
worship
he
was
especially
thrall
to
the
contralto
the
deep
low
voice
that
breaks
and
changes
in
the
middle
and
soars
all
at
once
into
a
magnified
angelic
boy
treble
it
pierced
through
his
ears
to
his
heart
and
stirred
his
very
vitals
he
had
once
heard
madame
alboni
and
it
had
been
an
epoch
in
his
life
he
would
have
been
an
easy
prey
to
the
sirens
even
beauty
paled
before
the
lovely
female
voice
singing
in
the
middle
of
the
note
the
nightingale
killed
the
i
need
hardly
say
that
poor
mimi
la
salope
had
not
the
voice
of
madame
alboni
nor
the
art
but
it
was
a
beautiful
voice
of
its
little
kind
always
in
the
very
middle
of
the
note
and
her
artless
art
had
its
quick
seduction
she
sang
little
songs
of
béranger
de
lui
or
disait
un
capitaine
or
enfants
moi
qui
suis
lisette
and
such
like
pretty
things
that
almost
brought
the
tears
to
little
billee
easily
moistened
eyes
but
soon
she
would
sing
little
songs
that
were
not
by
béranger
little
songs
with
slang
words
little
billee
had
french
enough
to
understand
but
from
the
kind
of
laughter
with
which
the
points
were
received
by
the
rapins
in
carrel
studio
he
guessed
these
little
songs
were
vile
though
the
touching
little
voice
was
as
that
of
the
seraphim
still
and
he
knew
the
pang
of
disenchantment
and
vicarious
shame
svengali
had
heard
her
sing
at
the
brasserie
des
porcherons
in
the
rue
du
and
had
volunteered
to
teach
her
and
she
went
to
see
him
in
his
garret
and
he
played
to
her
and
leered
and
ogled
and
flashed
his
bold
black
beady
jew
eyes
into
hers
and
she
straightway
mentally
prostrated
herself
in
reverence
and
adoration
before
this
dazzling
specimen
of
her
race
so
that
her
sordid
mercenary
little
soul
was
filled
with
the
sight
and
the
sound
of
him
as
of
a
lordly
godlike
hero
and
prophet
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
david
and
saul
in
one
and
then
he
set
himself
to
teach
her
kindly
and
patiently
at
first
calling
her
sweet
little
pet
names
his
rose
of
sharon
his
pearl
of
pabylon
his
liddle
cherusalem
skylark
and
promised
her
that
she
should
be
the
queen
of
the
nightingales
but
before
he
could
teach
her
anything
he
had
to
unteach
her
all
she
knew
her
breathing
the
production
of
her
voice
its
emission
everything
was
wrong
she
worked
indefatigably
to
please
him
and
soon
succeeded
in
forgetting
all
the
pretty
little
sympathetic
tricks
of
voice
and
phrasing
mother
nature
had
taught
her
illustration
a
voice
he
did
understand
but
though
she
had
an
exquisite
ear
she
had
no
real
musical
intelligence
no
intelligence
of
any
kind
except
about
sous
and
centimes
she
was
as
stupid
as
a
little
downy
owl
and
her
voice
was
just
a
light
native
warble
a
throstle
pipe
all
in
the
head
and
nose
and
throat
a
voice
he
understand
for
once
a
thing
of
mere
youth
and
health
and
bloom
and
high
spirits
like
her
beauty
such
as
it
was
du
diable
beauté
she
did
her
very
best
and
practised
all
she
could
in
this
new
way
and
sang
herself
hoarse
she
scarcely
ate
or
slept
for
practising
he
grew
harsh
and
impatient
and
coldly
severe
and
of
coarse
she
loved
him
all
the
more
and
the
more
she
loved
him
the
more
nervous
she
got
and
the
worse
she
sang
her
voice
cracked
her
ear
became
demoralized
her
attempts
to
vocalize
grew
almost
as
comical
as
trilby
so
that
he
lost
his
temper
completely
and
called
her
terrible
names
and
pinched
and
punched
her
with
his
big
bony
hands
till
she
wept
worse
than
niobe
and
borrowed
money
of
her
pieces
even
francs
and
demifrancs
which
he
never
paid
her
back
and
browbeat
and
bullied
and
ballyragged
her
till
she
went
quite
mad
for
love
of
him
and
would
have
jumped
out
of
his
window
to
give
him
a
moment
pleasure
he
did
not
ask
her
to
do
this
it
never
occurred
to
him
and
would
have
given
him
no
pleasure
to
speak
of
but
one
fine
sabbath
morning
a
saturday
of
course
he
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
chucked
her
neck
and
crop
out
of
his
garret
with
the
threat
that
if
she
ever
dared
to
show
her
face
there
again
he
would
denounce
her
to
the
police
an
awful
threat
to
the
likes
of
poor
mimi
la
salope
for
where
did
all
those
pieces
come
from
with
which
she
had
tried
to
pay
for
all
the
that
had
been
thrown
away
upon
her
not
from
merely
sitting
to
painters
thus
the
little
jerusalem
skylark
went
back
to
her
native
streets
again
a
mere
of
the
paris
slums
her
wings
clipped
her
spirit
quenched
and
broken
and
with
no
more
singing
left
in
her
than
a
common
or
garden
sparrow
not
so
much
and
so
no
more
of
la
betite
honorine
the
morning
after
this
adventure
svengali
woke
up
in
his
garret
with
a
tremendous
longing
to
spend
a
happy
day
for
it
was
a
sunday
and
a
very
fine
one
he
made
a
long
arm
and
reached
his
waistcoat
and
trousers
off
the
floor
and
emptied
the
contents
of
their
pockets
on
to
his
tattered
blanket
no
silver
no
gold
only
a
few
sous
and
pieces
just
enough
to
pay
for
a
meagre
he
had
cleared
out
gecko
the
day
before
and
spent
the
proceeds
ten
francs
at
least
in
one
night
riotous
living
pleasures
in
which
gecko
had
had
no
share
and
he
could
think
of
no
one
to
borrow
money
from
but
little
billee
taffy
and
the
laird
whom
he
had
neglected
and
left
untapped
for
days
so
he
slipped
into
his
clothes
and
looked
at
himself
in
what
remained
of
a
little
zinc
mirror
and
found
that
his
forehead
left
little
to
be
desired
but
that
his
eyes
and
temples
were
decidedly
grimy
wherefore
he
poured
a
little
water
out
of
a
little
jug
into
a
little
basin
and
twisting
the
corner
of
his
round
his
dirty
forefinger
he
delicately
dipped
it
and
removed
the
offending
stains
his
fingers
he
thought
would
do
very
well
for
another
day
or
two
as
they
were
he
ran
them
through
his
matted
black
mane
pushed
it
behind
his
ears
and
gave
it
the
twist
he
liked
and
that
was
so
much
disliked
by
his
english
friends
then
he
put
on
his
béret
and
his
velveteen
cloak
and
went
forth
into
the
sunny
streets
with
a
sense
of
the
fragrance
and
freedom
and
pleasantness
of
sunday
morning
in
paris
in
the
month
of
may
he
found
little
billee
sitting
in
a
zinc
busy
with
soap
and
sponge
and
was
so
tickled
and
interested
by
the
sight
that
he
quite
forgot
for
the
moment
what
he
had
come
for
himmel
why
the
devil
are
you
doing
that
he
asked
in
his
doing
asked
little
billee
in
his
french
of
sitting
in
water
and
playing
with
a
cake
of
soap
and
a
sponge
why
to
try
and
get
myself
i
suppose
ach
and
how
the
devil
did
you
get
yourself
then
to
this
little
billee
found
no
immediate
answer
and
went
on
with
his
ablution
after
the
hissing
splashing
energetic
fashion
of
englishmen
and
svengali
laughed
loud
and
long
at
the
spectacle
of
a
little
englishman
trying
to
get
himself
clean
tâchant
de
se
nettoyer
when
such
cleanliness
had
been
attained
as
was
possible
under
the
circumstances
svengali
begged
for
the
loan
of
two
hundred
francs
and
little
billee
gave
him
a
piece
content
with
this
de
the
german
asked
him
when
he
would
be
trying
to
get
himself
clean
again
as
he
would
much
like
to
come
and
see
him
do
it
demang
mattang
à
votre
sairveece
said
little
billee
with
a
courteous
bow
monday
too
gott
in
himmel
you
try
to
get
yourself
clean
and
he
laughed
himself
out
of
the
room
out
of
the
house
out
of
the
place
de
all
the
way
to
the
rue
de
seine
where
dwelt
the
man
of
blood
whom
he
meant
to
propitiate
with
the
story
of
that
original
little
billee
trying
to
get
himself
clean
that
he
might
borrow
another
piece
or
perhaps
two
illustration
and
so
no
more
as
the
reader
will
no
doubt
anticipate
he
found
taffy
in
his
bath
too
and
fell
to
laughing
with
such
convulsive
laughter
such
twistings
screwings
and
doublings
of
himself
up
such
pointings
of
his
dirty
forefinger
at
the
huge
naked
briton
that
taffy
was
offended
and
all
but
lost
his
temper
what
the
devil
are
you
cackling
at
sacred
head
of
pig
that
you
are
do
you
want
to
be
pitched
out
of
that
window
into
the
rue
de
seine
you
filthy
black
hebrew
sweep
just
you
wait
a
bit
wash
your
head
for
you
and
taffy
jumped
out
of
his
bath
such
a
towering
figure
of
righteous
herculean
wrath
that
svengali
was
appalled
and
fled
donnerwetter
he
exclaimed
as
he
tumbled
down
the
narrow
staircase
of
the
hôtel
de
seine
what
for
a
thick
head
what
for
a
what
for
a
rotten
brutal
verfluchter
kerl
of
an
englander
then
he
paused
for
thought
now
will
i
go
to
that
scottish
englander
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
for
that
other
piece
but
first
will
i
wait
a
little
while
till
he
has
perhaps
finished
trying
to
get
himself
clean
so
he
breakfasted
at
the
crèmerie
souchet
in
the
rue
and
feeling
quite
safe
again
he
laughed
and
laughed
till
his
very
sides
were
sore
two
englanders
in
one
day
as
naked
as
your
hand
a
big
one
and
a
little
one
trying
to
get
themselves
clean
he
rather
flattered
himself
he
scored
off
those
two
englanders
after
all
he
was
right
perhaps
from
his
point
of
view
you
can
get
as
dirty
in
a
week
as
in
a
lifetime
so
what
the
use
of
taking
such
a
lot
of
trouble
besides
so
long
as
you
are
clean
enough
to
suit
your
kind
to
be
any
cleaner
would
be
priggish
and
pedantic
and
get
you
disliked
just
as
svengali
was
about
to
knock
at
the
laird
door
trilby
came
from
durien
very
unlike
herself
her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
and
there
were
great
black
rings
round
them
she
was
pale
under
her
freckles
fous
afez
du
chacrin
matemoiselle
asked
he
she
told
him
that
she
had
neuralgia
in
her
eyes
a
thing
she
was
subject
to
that
the
pain
was
maddening
and
generally
lasted
hours
perhaps
i
can
cure
you
come
in
here
with
me
the
laird
ablutions
if
he
had
indulged
in
any
that
morning
were
evidently
over
for
the
day
he
was
breakfasting
on
a
roll
and
butter
and
coffee
of
his
own
brewing
he
was
deeply
distressed
at
the
sight
of
poor
trilby
sufferings
and
offered
whiskey
and
coffee
and
gingernuts
which
she
would
not
touch
svengali
told
her
to
sit
down
on
the
divan
and
sat
opposite
to
her
and
bade
her
look
him
well
in
the
white
of
the
eyes
pien
tans
le
planc
tes
yeux
then
he
made
little
passes
and
counterpasses
on
her
forehead
and
temples
and
down
her
cheek
and
neck
soon
her
eyes
closed
and
her
face
grew
placid
after
a
while
a
quarter
of
an
hour
perhaps
he
asked
her
if
she
suffered
still
oh
presque
plus
du
tout
monsieur
le
ciel
in
a
few
minutes
more
he
asked
the
laird
if
he
knew
german
just
enough
to
understand
said
the
laird
who
had
spent
a
year
in
düsseldorf
and
svengali
said
to
him
in
german
see
she
sleeps
not
but
she
shall
not
open
her
eyes
ask
her
are
you
asleep
miss
trilby
asked
the
laird
no
then
open
your
eyes
and
look
at
me
she
strained
her
eyes
but
could
not
and
said
so
then
svengali
said
again
in
german
she
shall
not
open
her
mouth
ask
her
illustration
englanders
in
one
day
why
could
you
open
your
eyes
miss
trilby
she
strained
to
open
her
mouth
and
speak
but
in
vain
she
shall
not
rise
from
the
divan
ask
her
but
trilby
was
spellbound
and
could
not
move
i
will
now
set
her
free
said
svengali
and
lo
she
got
up
and
waved
her
arms
and
cried
vive
la
prusse
me
guérie
and
in
her
gratitude
she
kissed
svengali
hand
and
he
leered
and
showed
his
big
brown
teeth
and
the
yellow
whites
at
the
top
of
his
big
black
eyes
and
drew
his
breath
with
a
hiss
now
i
go
to
durien
and
sit
how
can
i
thank
you
monsieur
you
have
taken
all
my
pain
away
yes
matemoiselle
i
have
got
it
myself
it
is
in
my
elbows

comes
from
you
every
time
you
have
pain

shall
come
to

i
will
cure
you
and
take
your
pain
myself
oh
you
are
too
good
and
in
her
high
spirits
she
turned
round
on
her
heel
and
uttered
her
portentous
milk
below
the
very
rafters
rang
with
it
and
the
piano
gave
out
a
solemn
response
what
is
that
you
say
matemoiselle
oh
it
what
the
milkmen
say
in
england
it
is
a
wonderful
cry
matemoiselle
wunderschön
it
comes
straight
through
the
heart
it
has
its
roots
in
the
stomach
and
blossoms
into
music
on
the
lips
like
the
voice
of
madame
alboni
voce
sulle
labbre
it
is
good
production
un
cri
du

trilby
blushed
with
pride
and
pleasure
yes
matemoiselle
i
only
know
one
person
in
the
whole
world
who
can
produce
the
voice
so
well
as
you
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
who
is
it
monsieur
yourself
ach
no
matemoiselle
i
have
not
that
privilege
i
have
unfortunately
no
voice
to
produce
it
is
a
waiter
at
the
café
de
la
rotonde
in
the
palais
royal
when
you
call
for
coffee
he
says
in
basso
profondo
tiefstimme
moll
below
the
line
it
is
phenomenal
it
is
like
a
cannon
a
cannon
also
has
very
good
production
matemoiselle
they
pay
him
for
it
a
thousand
francs
a
year
because
he
brings
many
customers
to
the
café
de
la
rotonde
where
the
coffee
is
very
good
when
he
dies
they
will
search
all
france
for
another
and
then
all
germany
where
the
good
big
waiters
come
from
and
the
cannons
but
they
will
not
find
him
and
the
café
de
la
rotonde
will
be
bankrupt
unless
you
will
consent
to
take
his
place
will
you
permit
that
i
shall
look
into
your
mouth
matemoiselle
she
opened
her
mouth
wide
and
he
looked
into
it
himmel
the
roof
of
your
mouth
is
like
the
dome
of
the
panthéon
there
is
room
in
it
for
les
gloires
de
la
france
and
a
little
to
spare
the
entrance
to
your
throat
is
like
the
middle
porch
of
sulpice
when
the
doors
are
open
for
the
faithful
on
day
and
not
one
tooth
is
missing
british
teeth
as
white
as
milk
and
as
big
as
and
your
little
tongue
is
scooped
out
like
the
leaf
of
a
pink
peony
and
the
bridge
of
your
nose
is
like
the
belly
of
a
stradivarius
what
a
and
inside
your
beautiful
big
chest
the
lungs
are
made
of
leather
and
your
breath
it
embalms
like
the
breath
of
a
beautiful
white
heifer
fed
on
the
buttercups
and
daisies
of
the
vaterland
and
you
have
a
quick
soft
susceptible
heart
a
heart
of
gold

all
that
sees
itself
in
your
face

the

what
a
pity
you
have
not
also
the
musical
organization
oh
but
i
monsieur
you
heard
me
sing
bolt
did
you
what
makes
you
say
that
svengali
was
confused
for
a
moment
then
he
said
when
i
play
the
of
schubert
matemoiselle
you
look
another
way
and
smoke
a
cigarette
you
look
at
the
big
taffy
at
the
little
billee
at
the
pictures
on
the
walls
or
out
of
window
at
the
sky
the
of
notre
dame
de
paris
you
do
not
look
at
svengali
svengali
who
looks
at
you
with
all
his
eyes
and
plays
you
the
of
schubert
oh
maïe
aïe
exclaimed
trilby
you
use
lovely
language
but
never
mind
matemoiselle
when
your
pain
arrives
then
shall
you
come
once
more
to
svengali
and
he
shall
take
it
away
from
you
and
keep
it
himself
for
a
soufenir
of
you
when
you
are
gone
and
when
you
have
it
no
more
he
shall
play
you
the
of
schubert
all
alone
for
you
and
then
les
étutiants
montez
à
la
chaumière
because
it
is
gayer
you
shall
see
nothing
hear
nothing
think
of
nothing
but
svengali
svengali
svengali
here
he
felt
his
peroration
to
be
so
happy
and
effective
that
he
thought
it
well
to
go
at
once
and
make
a
good
exit
so
he
bent
over
shapely
freckled
hand
and
kissed
it
and
bowed
himself
out
of
the
room
without
even
borrowing
his
piece
he
a
rum
ai
he
said
trilby
he
reminds
me
of
a
big
hungry
spider
and
makes
me
feel
like
a
fly
but
he
cured
my
pain
he
cured
my
pain
ah
you
do
know
what
my
pain
is
when
it
comes
i
would
have
much
to
do
with
him
all
the
same
said
the
laird
i
sooner
have
any
pain
than
have
it
cured
in
that
unnatural
way
and
by
such
a
man
as
that
he
a
bad
fellow
svengali
i
sure
of
it
he
mesmerized
you
that
what
it
is
mesmerism
i
often
heard
of
it
but
never
seen
it
done
before
they
get
you
into
their
power
and
just
make
you
do
any
blessed
thing
they
please
lie
murder
steal
anything
and
kill
yourself
into
the
bargain
when
they
done
with
you
it
just
too
terrible
to
think
of
so
spake
the
laird
earnestly
solemnly
surprised
out
of
his
usual
self
and
most
painfully
impressed
and
his
own
impressiveness
grew
upon
him
and
impressed
him
still
more
he
loomed
quite
prophetic
cold
shivers
went
down
trilby
back
as
she
listened
she
had
a
singularly
impressionable
nature
as
was
shown
by
her
quick
and
ready
susceptibility
to
svengali
hypnotic
influence
and
all
that
day
as
she
posed
for
durien
to
whom
she
did
not
mention
her
adventure
she
was
haunted
by
the
memory
of
svengali
big
eyes
and
the
touch
of
his
soft
dirty
on
her
face
and
her
fear
and
her
repulsion
grew
together
and
svengali
svengali
svengali
went
ringing
in
her
head
and
ears
till
it
became
an
obsession
a
dirge
a
knell
an
unendurable
burden
almost
as
hard
to
bear
as
the
pain
in
her
eyes
svengali
svengali
at
last
she
asked
durien
if
he
knew
him

it

very
flattering
to
one
before
little
billee
became
one
of
this
band
of
brothers
he
had
been
working
for
three
or
four
years
in
a
london
art
school
drawing
and
painting
from
the
life
he
had
also
worked
from
the
antique
in
the
british
museum
so
that
he
was
no
novice
as
he
made
his
début
at
carrel
one
monday
morning
he
felt
somewhat
shy
and
ill
at
ease
he
had
studied
french
most
earnestly
at
home
in
england
and
could
read
it
pretty
well
and
even
write
it
and
speak
it
after
a
fashion
but
he
spoke
it
with
much
difficulty
and
found
studio
french
a
different
language
altogether
from
the
formal
and
polite
language
he
had
been
at
such
pains
to
learn
ollendorff
does
not

the
quartier

acting
on
taffy
advice
for
taffy
had
worked
under
carrel
little
billee
handed
sixty
francs
to
the
massier
for
his
a
lordly
sum
and
this
liberality
made
a
most
favorable
impression
and
went
far
to
destroy
any
little
prejudice
that
might
have
been
caused
by
the
daintiness
of
his
dress
the
cleanliness
of
his
person
and
the
politeness
of
his
manners
a
place
was
assigned
to
him
and
an
easel
and
a
board
for
he
elected
to
stand
at
his
work
and
begin
with
a
chalk
drawing
the
model
a
male
was
posed
and
work
began
in
silence
monday
morning
is
always
rather
sulky
everywhere
except
perhaps
in
judee
during
the
ten
minutes
rest
three
or
four
students
came
and
looked
at
little
billee
beginnings
and
saw
at
a
glance
that
he
thoroughly
well
knew
what
he
was
about
and
respected
him
for
it
nature
had
given
him
a
singularly
light
hand
or
rather
two
for
he
was
ambidextrous
and
could
use
both
with
equal
skill
and
a
few
practice
at
a
london
life
school
had
quite
cured
him
of
that
purposeless
indecision
of
touch
which
often
characterizes
the
prentice
hand
for
years
of
apprenticeship
and
remains
with
the
amateur
for
life
the
lightest
and
most
careless
of
his
pencil
strokes
had
a
precision
that
was
inimitable
and
a
charm
that
specially
belonged
to
him
and
was
easy
to
recognize
at
a
glance
his
touch
on
either
canvas
or
paper
was
like
svengali
on
the
unique
as
the
morning
ripened
little
attempts
at
conversation
were
made
little
breakings
of
the
ice
of
silence
it
was
lambert
a
youth
with
a
singularly
facetious
face
who
first
woke
the
stillness
with
the
following
remarks
in
english
very
badly
pronounced
av
you
seen
my
fahzere
ole
shoes
i
av
not
seen
your
fahzere
ole
shoes
then
after
a
pause
av
you
seen
my
fahzere
ole
i
av
not
seen
your
fahzere
old
presently
another
said
je
trouve
a
une
jolie
tête
but
i
will
put
it
all
into
english
i
find
that
he
has
a
pretty
head
the
englishman
what
say
barizel
yes
but
why
has
he
got
eyes
like
two
a
penny
because
he
an
englishman
yes
but
why
has
he
got
a
mouth
like
a
with
two
big
teeth
in
front
like
the
double
blank
at
dominos
because
he
an
englishman
illustration
you
seen
my
fahzere
ole
shoes
yes
but
why
has
he
got
a
back
without
any
bend
in
it
as
if
swallowed
the
colonne
vendôme
as
far
up
as
the
battle
of
austerlitz
because
he
an
englishman
and
so
on
till
all
the
supposed
characteristics
of
little
outer
man
were
exhausted
then
papelard
what
should
like
to
know
if
the
englishman
says
his
prayers
before
going
to
bed
ask
him
ask
him
yourself
should
like
to
know
if
the
englishman
has
sisters
and
if
so
how
old
and
how
many
and
what
sex
ask
him
ask
him
yourself
should
like
to
know
the
detailed
and
circumstantial
history
of
the
englishman
first
love
and
how
he
lost
his
innocence
ask
him
etc
little
billee
conscious
that
he
was
the
object
of
conversation
grew
somewhat
nervous
soon
he
was
addressed
directly
dites
donc
kwaw
said
little
billee
une
sœur
wee
vous
ressemble
nong
bien
dommage
dit
ses
prières
le
soir
en
se
couchant
a
fierce
look
came
into
little
billee
eyes
and
a
redness
to
his
cheeks
and
this
particular
form
of
overture
to
friendship
was
abandoned
presently
lambert
said
si
nous
mettions
à
little
billee
who
had
been
warned
knew
what
this
ordeal
meant
they
tied
you
to
a
ladder
and
carried
you
in
procession
up
and
down
the
and
if
you
were
nasty
about
it
they
put
you
under
the
pump
during
the
next
rest
it
was
explained
to
him
that
he
must
submit
to
this
indignity
and
the
ladder
which
was
used
for
reaching
the
high
shelves
round
the
studio
was
got
ready
little
billee
smiled
a
singularly
winning
smile
and
suffered
himself
to
be
bound
with
such
that
they
voted
it
was
amusing
and
unbound
him
and
he
escaped
the
ordeal
by
ladder
taffy
had
also
escaped
but
in
another
way
when
they
tried
to
seize
him
he
took
up
the
first
that
came
to
hand
and
using
him
as
a
kind
of
club
he
swung
him
about
so
freely
and
knocked
down
so
many
students
and
easels
and
with
him
and
made
such
a
terrific
rumpus
that
the
whole
studio
had
to
cry
for
pax
then
he
performed
feats
of
strength
of
such
a
surprising
kind
that
the
memory
of
him
remained
in
carrel
studio
for
years
and
he
became
a
legend
a
tradition
a
myth
it
is
now
said
in
what
still
remains
of
the
quartier
latin
that
he
was
seven
feet
high
and
used
to
juggle
with
the
massier
and
model
as
with
a
pair
of
billiard
balls
using
only
his
left
hand
to
return
to
little
billee
when
it
struck
twelve
the
cakes
and
rum
punch
arrived
a
very
goodly
sight
that
put
every
one
in
a
good
temper
the
cakes
were
of
three
kinds
babas
madeleines
and
savarins
three
sous
apiece
fourpence
the
set
of
three
no
nicer
cakes
are
made
in
france
and
they
are
as
good
in
the
quartier
latin
as
anywhere
else
no
nicer
cakes
are
made
in
the
whole
world
that
i
know
of
you
must
begin
with
the
madeleine
which
is
rich
and
rather
heavy
then
the
baba
and
finish
up
with
the
savarin
which
is
shaped
like
a
ring
very
light
and
flavored
with
rum
and
then
you
must
really
leave
off
the
rum
punch
was
tepid
very
sweet
and
not
a
bit
too
strong
they
dragged
the
into
the
middle
and
a
chair
was
put
on
for
little
billee
who
dispensed
his
hospitality
in
a
very
polite
and
attractive
manner
helping
the
massier
first
and
then
the
other
graybeards
in
the
order
of
their
grayness
and
so
on
down
to
the
model
presently
just
as
he
was
about
to
help
himself
he
was
asked
to
sing
them
an
english
song
after
a
little
pressing
he
sang
them
a
song
about
a
gay
cavalier
who
went
to
serenade
his
mistress
and
a
ladder
of
ropes
and
a
pair
of
masculine
gloves
that
did
belong
to
the
gay
cavalier
but
which
he
found
in
his
lady
bower
a
poor
sort
of
song
but
it
was
the
nearest
approach
to
a
comic
song
he
knew
there
are
four
verses
to
it
and
each
verse
is
rather
long
it
does
not
sound
at
all
funny
to
a
french
audience
and
even
with
an
english
one
little
billee
was
not
good
at
comic
songs
illustration
taffy
à
he
was
however
much
applauded
at
the
end
of
each
verse
when
he
had
finished
he
was
asked
if
he
were
sure
there
was
any
more
of
it
and
they
expressed
a
deep
regret
and
then
each
student
straddling
on
his
little
chair
as
on
a
horse
and
clasping
the
back
of
it
in
both
hands
galloped
round
little
billee
throne
quite
seriously
the
strangest
procession
he
had
ever
seen
it
made
him
laugh
till
he
cried
so
that
he
could
eat
or
drink
then
he
served
more
punch
and
cake
all
round
and
just
as
he
was
going
to
begin
himself
papelard
said
say
you
others
i
find
that
the
englishman
has
something
of
truly
distinguished
in
the
voice
something
of
sympathetic
of
touching
something
of
ne
sais
bouchardy
yes
yes
something
of
ne
sais
that
the
very
phrase
pas
vous
autres
that
is
a
good
phrase
that
papelard
has
just
invented
to
describe
the
voice
of
the
englishman
he
is
very
intelligent
papelard
chorus
perfect
perfect
he
has
the
genius
of
characterization
papelard
dites
donc
once
more
that
beautiful
song
hein
nous
vous
en
prions
tous
little
billee
willingly
sang
it
again
with
even
greater
applause
and
again
they
galloped
but
the
other
way
round
and
faster
so
that
little
billee
became
quite
hysterical
and
laughed
till
his
sides
ached
then
dubosc
i
find
there
is
something
of
very
capitous
and
exciting
in
english
music
of
very
stimulating
and
you
bouchardy
bouchardy
oh
me
it
is
above
all
the
that
i
admire
they
have
something
of
passionate
of
romantic
zese
zey
do
not
belong
to
me
i
do
know
what
that
means
but
i
love
that
sort
of
of
of
ne
sais
in
short
just
more
only
the
couplets
so
he
sang
it
a
third
time
all
four
verses
while
they
leisurely
ate
and
drank
and
smoked
and
looked
at
each
other
nodding
solemn
commendation
of
certain
phrases
in
the
song
très
bien
très
bien
ah
voilà
qui
est
bien
réussi
épatant
ça
très
fin
etc
for
stimulated
by
success
and
rising
to
the
occasion
he
did
his
very
utmost
to
surpass
himself
in
emphasis
of
gesture
and
accent
and
histrionic
drollery
heedless
of
the
fact
that
not
one
of
his
listeners
had
the
slightest
notion
what
his
song
was
about
it
was
a
sorry
performance
and
it
was
not
till
he
had
sung
it
four
times
that
he
discovered
the
whole
thing
was
an
elaborate
impromptu
farce
of
which
he
was
the
butt
and
that
of
all
his
royal
spread
not
a
crumb
or
a
drop
was
left
for
himself
it
was
the
old
fable
of
the
fox
and
the
crow
and
to
do
him
justice
he
laughed
as
heartily
as
any
one
as
if
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
joke
and
when
you
take
jokes
in
that
way
people
soon
leave
off
poking
fun
at
you
it
is
almost
as
good
as
being
very
big
like
taffy
and
having
a
choleric
blue
eye
such
was
little
billee
first
experience
of
carrel
studio
where
he
spent
many
happy
mornings
and
made
many
good
friends
no
more
popular
student
had
ever
worked
there
within
the
memory
of
the
grayest
graybeards
none
more
amiable
more
genial
more
cheerful
considerate
and
polite
and
certainly
none
with
greater
gifts
for
art
carrel
would
devote
at
least
fifteen
minutes
to
him
and
invited
him
often
to
his
own
private
studio
and
often
on
the
fourth
and
fifth
day
of
the
week
a
group
of
admiring
students
would
be
gathered
by
his
easel
watching
him
as
he
worked
un
rude
lapin
au
moins
il
sait
son
orthographe
en
peinture
ce
such
was
the
verdict
on
little
billee
at
carrel
studio
and
i
can
conceive
no
loftier
praise
young
as
she
was
seventeen
or
eighteen
or
thereabouts
and
also
tender
like
little
billee
trilby
had
singularly
clear
and
quick
perceptions
in
all
matters
that
concerned
her
tastes
fancies
or
affections
and
thoroughly
knew
her
own
mind
and
never
lost
much
time
in
making
it
up
on
the
occasion
of
her
first
visit
to
the
studio
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
it
took
her
just
five
minutes
to
decide
that
it
was
quite
the
nicest
homeliest
genialest
jolliest
studio
in
the
whole
quartier
latin
or
out
of
it
and
its
three
inhabitants
individually
and
collectively
were
more
to
her
taste
than
any
one
else
she
had
ever
met
illustration
the
fox
and
the
crow
in
the
first
place
they
were
english
and
she
loved
to
hear
her
and
speak
it
it
awoke
all
manner
of
tender
recollections
sweet
reminiscences
of
her
childhood
her
parents
her
old
home
such
a
home
as
it
was
or
rather
such
homes
for
there
had
been
many
flittings
from
one
poor
nest
to
another
the
had
been
as
birds
on
the
bough
she
had
loved
her
parents
very
dearly
and
indeed
with
all
their
faults
they
had
many
endearing
qualities
the
qualities
that
so
often
go
with
those
particular
faults
charm
geniality
kindness
warmth
of
heart
the
constant
wish
to
please
the
generosity
that
comes
before
justice
and
lends
its
last
sixpence
and
forgets
to
pay
its
debts
she
knew
other
english
and
american
artists
and
had
sat
to
them
frequently
for
the
head
and
hands
but
none
of
these
for
general
agreeableness
of
aspect
or
manner
could
compare
in
her
mind
with
the
stalwart
and
magnificent
taffy
the
jolly
fat
laird
of
cockpen
the
refined
sympathetic
and
elegant
little
billee
and
she
resolved
that
she
would
see
as
much
of
them
as
she
could
that
she
would
make
herself
at
home
in
that
particular
studio
and
necessary
to
its
locataires
and
without
being
the
least
bit
vain
or
she
had
no
doubts
whatever
of
her
power
to
please
to
make
herself
both
useful
and
ornamental
if
it
suited
her
purpose
to
do
so
her
first
step
in
this
direction
was
to
borrow
père
martin
basket
and
lantern
and
pick
he
had
more
than
one
set
of
these
trade
properties
for
the
use
of
taffy
whom
she
feared
she
might
have
offended
by
the
freedom
of
her
comments
on
his
picture
then
as
often
as
she
felt
it
to
be
discreet
she
sounded
her
at
the
studio
door
and
went
in
and
made
kind
inquiries
and
sitting
on
the
ate
her
bread
and
cheese
and
smoked
her
cigarette
and
passed
the
time
of
day
as
she
chose
to
call
it
telling
them
all
such
news
of
the
quartier
as
had
come
within
her
own
immediate
ken
she
was
always
full
of
little
stories
of
other
studios
which
to
do
her
justice
were
always
and
probably
true
quite
so
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
she
was
the
most
literal
person
alive
and
she
told
all
these
ragots
cancans
et
potins
in
a
quaint
and
amusing
manner
the
slightest
look
of
gravity
or
boredom
on
one
of
those
three
faces
and
she
made
herself
scarce
at
once
she
soon
found
opportunities
for
usefulness
also
if
a
costume
were
wanted
for
instance
she
knew
where
to
borrow
it
or
hire
it
or
buy
it
cheaper
than
any
one
anywhere
else
she
procured
stuffs
for
them
at
cost
price
as
it
seemed
and
made
them
into
draperies
and
female
garments
of
any
kind
that
was
wanted
and
sat
in
them
for
the
toreador
sweetheart
she
made
the
mantilla
herself
for
taffy
starving
about
to
throw
herself
into
the
seine
for
little
billee
studies
of
the
beautiful
french
peasant
girl
in
his
picture
now
so
famous
called
the
pitcher
goes
to
the
well
then
she
darned
their
socks
and
mended
their
clothes
and
got
all
their
washing
done
properly
and
cheaply
at
her
friend
madame
boisse
in
the
rue
des
cloîtres
ste
pétronille
and
then
again
when
they
were
hard
up
and
wanted
a
good
round
sum
of
money
for
some
little
pleasure
excursion
such
as
a
trip
to
fontainebleau
or
barbizon
for
two
or
three
days
it
was
she
who
took
their
watches
and
and
things
to
the
mount
of
piety
in
the
street
of
the
well
of
love
where
dwelt
ma
tante
which
is
french
for
my
uncle
in
this
connection
in
order
to
raise
the
necessary
funds
illustration
the
latin
quarter
she
was
of
course
most
liberally
paid
for
all
these
little
services
rendered
with
such
pleasure
and
far
too
liberally
she
thought
she
would
have
been
really
happier
doing
them
for
love
thus
in
a
very
short
time
she
became
a
a
sunny
and
ever
welcome
vision
of
health
and
grace
and
liveliness
and
unalterable
always
ready
to
take
any
trouble
to
please
her
beloved
angliches
as
they
were
called
by
madame
vinard
the
handsome
who
was
almost
jealous
for
she
was
devoted
to
the
angliches
too
and
so
was
monsieur
vinard
and
so
were
the
little
vinards
she
knew
when
to
talk
and
when
to
laugh
and
when
to
hold
her
tongue
and
the
sight
of
her
sitting
on
the
darning
the
laird
socks
or
sewing
buttons
on
his
shirts
or
repairing
the
in
his
trousers
was
so
pleasant
that
it
was
painted
by
all
three
one
of
these
sketches
in
by
little
billee
sold
the
other
day
at
christie
for
a
sum
so
large
that
i
hardly
dare
to
mention
it
it
was
done
in
an
afternoon
sometimes
on
a
rainy
day
when
it
was
decided
they
should
dine
at
home
she
would
fetch
the
food
and
cook
it
and
lay
the
cloth
and
even
make
the
salad
she
was
a
better
saladist
than
taffy
a
better
cook
than
the
laird
a
better
caterer
than
little
billee
and
she
would
be
invited
to
take
her
share
in
the
banquet
and
on
these
occasions
her
tremulous
happiness
was
so
immense
that
it
would
be
quite
pathetic
to
see
almost
painful
and
their
three
british
hearts
were
touched
by
thoughts
of
all
the
loneliness
and
homelessness
the
expatriation
the
loss
of
caste
that
all
this
eager
childish
clinging
revealed
and
that
is
why
no
doubt
that
with
all
this
familiar
intimacy
there
was
never
any
hint
of
gallantry
or
flirtation
in
any
shape
or
form
whatever
bonne
camaraderie
voilà
tout
had
she
been
little
sister
she
could
not
have
been
treated
with
more
real
respect
and
her
deep
gratitude
for
this
unwonted
compliment
transcended
any
passion
she
had
ever
felt
as
the
good
lafontaine
so
prettily
says
ces
animaux
vivaient
entre
eux
comme
cousins
cette
union
si
douce
et
presque
fraternelle
edifiait
tous
les
voisins
and
then
their
talk
it
was
to
her
as
the
talk
of
the
gods
in
olympus
save
that
it
was
easier
to
understand
and
she
could
always
understand
it
for
she
was
a
very
intelligent
person
in
spite
of
her
wofully
neglected
education
and
most
ambitious
to
learn
a
new
ambition
for
her
so
they
lent
her
books
english
books
dickens
thackeray
walter
scott
which
she
devoured
in
the
silence
of
the
night
the
solitude
of
her
little
attic
in
the
rue
des
and
new
worlds
were
revealed
to
her
she
grew
more
english
every
day
and
that
was
a
good
thing
trilby
speaking
english
and
trilby
speaking
french
were
two
different
beings
trilby
english
was
more
or
less
that
of
her
father
a
man
her
mother
who
was
a
scotch
woman
although
an
uneducated
one
had
none
of
the
ungainliness
that
mars
the
speech
of
so
many
english
women
in
that
humble
rank
no
droppings
of
the
h
no
broadening
of
the
o
and
a
illustration
cuisine
bourgeoise
en
bohème
trilby
french
was
that
of
the
quartier
latin
droll
slangy
piquant
quaint
picturesque
quite
the
reverse
of
ungainly
but
in
which
there
was
scarcely
a
turn
of
phrase
that
would
not
stamp
the
speaker
as
being
hopelessly
emphatically
no
lady
though
it
was
funny
without
being
vulgar
it
was
perhaps
a
little
funny
and
she
handled
her
knife
and
fork
in
the
dainty
english
way
as
no
doubt
her
father
had
done
and
his
and
indeed
when
alone
with
them
she
was
so
absolutely
like
a
lady
that
it
seemed
quite
odd
though
very
seductive
to
see
her
in
a
grisette
cap
and
dress
and
apron
so
much
for
her
english
training
but
enter
a
frenchman
or
two
and
a
transformation
effected
itself
immediately
a
new
incarnation
of
trilbyness
so
droll
and
amusing
that
it
was
difficult
to
decide
which
of
her
two
incarnations
was
the
most
attractive
it
must
be
admitted
that
she
had
her
faults
like
little
billee
for
instance
she
would
be
miserably
jealous
of
any
other
woman
who
came
to
the
studio
to
sit
or
scrub
or
sweep
or
do
anything
else
even
of
the
dirty
tipsy
old
hag
who
sat
for
taffy
found
drowned
as
if
she
could
have
sat
for
it
herself
and
then
she
would
be
cross
and
sulky
but
not
for
long
an
injured
martyr
soon
ready
to
forgive
and
be
forgiven
she
would
give
up
any
sitting
to
come
and
sit
to
her
three
english
friends
even
durien
had
serious
cause
for
complaint
then
her
affection
was
exacting
she
always
wanted
to
be
told
one
was
fond
of
her
and
she
dearly
loved
her
own
way
even
in
the
sewing
on
of
buttons
and
the
darning
of
socks
which
was
innocent
enough
but
when
it
came
to
the
cutting
and
fashioning
of
garments
for
a
bride
it
was
a
nuisance
not
to
be
borne
what
could
know
of
toreadors
brides
and
their
the
laird
would
indignantly
ask
as
if
he
were
a
toreador
himself
and
this
was
the
aggravating
side
of
her
irrepressible
trilbyness
in
the
caressing
demonstrative
tenderness
of
her
friendship
she
made
the
soft
eyes
at
all
three
indiscriminately
but
sometimes
little
billee
would
look
up
from
his
work
as
she
was
sitting
to
taffy
or
the
laird
and
find
her
gray
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
an
gaze
so
piercingly
penetratingly
unutterably
sweet
and
kind
and
tender
such
a
brooding
dovelike
look
of
soft
and
warm
solicitude
that
he
would
feel
a
flutter
at
his
heart
and
his
hand
would
shake
so
that
he
could
not
paint
and
in
a
waking
dream
he
would
remember
that
his
mother
had
often
looked
at
him
like
that
when
he
was
a
small
boy
and
she
a
beautiful
young
woman
untouched
by
care
or
sorrow
and
the
tear
that
always
lay
in
readiness
so
close
to
the
corner
of
little
billee
eye
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
keep
itself
in
its
proper
place
unshed
and
at
such
moments
the
thought
that
trilby
sat
for
the
figure
would
go
through
him
like
a
knife
she
did
not
sit
promiscuously
to
anybody
who
asked
it
is
true
but
she
still
sat
to
durien
to
the
great
gérôme
to
carrel
who
scarcely
used
any
other
model
it
was
poor
trilby
sad
distinction
that
she
surpassed
all
other
models
as
calypso
surpassed
her
nymphs
and
whether
by
long
habit
or
through
some
obtuseness
in
her
nature
or
lack
of
imagination
she
was
equally
unconscious
of
self
with
her
clothes
on
or
without
truly
she
could
be
naked
and
unashamed
in
this
respect
an
absolute
savage
illustration
the
soft
eyes
she
would
have
ridden
through
coventry
like
lady
godiva
but
without
giving
it
a
thought
beyond
wondering
why
the
streets
were
empty
and
the
shops
closed
and
the
blinds
pulled
down
would
even
have
looked
up
to
peeping
tom
shutter
with
a
friendly
nod
had
she
known
he
was
behind
it
in
fact
she
was
absolutely
without
that
kind
of
shame
as
she
was
without
any
kind
of
fear
but
she
was
destined
soon
to
know
both
fear
and
shame
and
here
it
would
not
be
amiss
for
me
to
state
a
fact
well
known
to
all
painters
and
sculptors
who
have
used
the
nude
model
except
a
few
senile
pretenders
whose
purity
not
being
of
the
right
sort
has
gone
rank
from
too
much
watching
namely
that
nothing
is
so
chaste
as
nudity
venus
herself
as
she
drops
her
garments
and
steps
on
to
the
leaves
behind
her
on
the
floor
every
weapon
in
her
armory
by
which
she
can
pierce
to
the
grosser
passions
of
man
the
more
perfect
her
unveiled
beauty
the
more
keenly
it
appeals
to
his
higher
instincts
and
where
her
beauty
fails
as
it
almost
always
does
somewhere
in
the
venuses
who
sit
for
hire
the
failure
is
so
lamentably
conspicuous
in
the
studio
light
the
fierce
light
that
beats
on
this
particular
throne
that
don
juan
himself
who
has
not
got
to
paint
were
fain
to
hide
his
eyes
in
sorrow
and
disenchantment
and
fly
to
other
climes
all
beauty
is
sexless
in
the
eyes
of
the
artist
at
his
work
the
beauty
of
man
the
beauty
of
woman
the
heavenly
beauty
of
the
child
which
is
the
sweetest
and
best
of
all
indeed
it
is
woman
lovely
woman
whose
beauty
falls
the
shortest
for
sheer
lack
of
proper
physical
training
as
for
trilby
g
to
whom
she
sat
for
his
phryne
once
told
me
that
the
sight
of
her
thus
was
a
thing
to
melt
sir
galahad
and
sober
silenus
and
chasten
jove
himself
a
thing
to
quixotize
a
modern
french
masher
i
can
well
believe
him
for
myself
i
only
speak
of
trilby
as
i
have
seen
her
clothed
and
in
her
right
mind
she
never
sat
to
me
for
any
phryne
never
bared
herself
to
me
nor
did
i
ever
dream
of
asking
her
i
would
as
soon
have
asked
the
queen
of
spain
to
let
me
paint
her
legs
but
i
have
worked
from
many
female
models
in
many
countries
some
of
them
the
best
of
their
kind
i
have
also
like
svengali
seen
taffy
trying
to
get
himself
clean
either
at
home
or
in
the
of
the
seine
and
never
a
sitting
woman
among
them
all
who
could
match
for
grace
or
finish
or
splendor
of
outward
form
that
mighty
yorkshireman
sitting
in
his
tub
or
sunning
himself
like
ilyssus
at
the
bains
henri
quatre
or
taking
his
running
header
la
off
the
at
the
bains
deligny
with
a
group
of
wondering
frenchmen
gathered
round
up
he
shot
himself
into
with
a
sounding
double
downward
kick
parabolically
then
turning
a
splendid
against
the
sky
down
he
came
headlong
his
body
straight
and
stiff
as
an
arrow
and
made
his
clean
hole
in
the
water
without
splash
or
sound
to
reappear
a
hundred
yards
farther

if
our

were

that

could
go

probably

in

although

should
still
murder

bear

and
break
the

take

in

much
deplorable
wickedness

would
cease
to
exist
for
sheer
lack
of

would
be
relieved
of
its

task
in
this
sinful
world

aphrodite
aselgeia
would
have
to
go

with

perhaps
our

would
be

was

no

no

of

uglinesses

worse
and
also

a

would
be

from

and
suffered
to
hold
its
own
and
flaunt
away
with
the
best
in
the
inner
garden
of
roses
and
here
let
me
humbly
apologize
to
the
casual
reader
for
the
length
and
possible
irrelevancy
of
this
digression
and
for
its
subject
to
those
who
may
find
matter
for
sincere
disapprobation
or
even
grave
offence
in
a
thing
that
has
always
seemed
to
me
so
simple
so
commonplace
as
to
be
hardly
worth
talking
or
writing
about
i
can
only
plead
a
sincerity
equal
to
theirs
and
as
deep
a
love
and
reverence
for
the
gracious
goodly
shape
that
god
is
said
to
have
made
after
his
own
image
for
inscrutable
purposes
of
his
own
nor
indeed
am
i
pleading
for
such
a
subversive
and
revolutionary
measure
as
the
wholesale
abolition
of
clothes
being
the
chilliest
of
mortals
and
quite
unlike
theseus
or
ilyssus
either
sometimes
trilby
would
bring
her
little
brother
to
the
studio
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
in
his
beaux
habits
de
pâques
his
hair
well
curled
and
pomatumed
his
hands
and
face
well
washed
he
was
a
very
engaging
little
mortal
the
laird
would
fill
his
pockets
full
of
scotch
goodies
and
paint
him
as
a
little
spaniard
in
le
fils
du
toreador
a
sweet
little
spaniard
with
blue
eyes
and
curly
locks
as
light
as
tow
and
a
complexion
of
milk
and
roses
in
singular
and
piquant
contrast
to
his
swarthy
progenitor
taffy
would
use
him
as
an
indian
club
or
a
to
the
infinite
delight
and
swing
him
on
the
trapeze
and
teach
him
la
boxe
and
the
sweetness
and
fun
of
his
shrill
happy
infantile
laughter
which
was
like
an
echo
of
trilby
only
an
octave
higher
so
moved
and
touched
and
tickled
one
that
taffy
had
to
look
quite
fierce
so
he
might
hide
the
strange
delight
of
tenderness
that
somehow
filled
his
manly
bosom
at
the
mere
sound
of
it
lest
little
billee
and
the
laird
should
think
him
and
the
fiercer
taffy
looked
the
less
this
small
mite
was
afraid
of
him
little
billee
made
a
beautiful
sketch
of
him
just
as
he
was
and
gave
it
to
trilby
who
gave
it
to
le
père
martin
who
gave
it
to
his
wife
with
strict
injunctions
not
to
sell
it
as
an
old
master
alas
it
an
old
master
now
and
heaven
only
knows
who
has
got
it
those
were
happy
days
for
trilby
little
brother
happy
days
for
trilby
who
was
immensely
fond
of
him
and
very
proud
and
the
happiest
day
of
all
was
when
trois
angliches
took
trilby
and
jeannot
for
so
the
mite
was
called
to
spend
the
sunday
in
the
woods
at
meudon
and
breakfast
and
dine
at
the
garde
champêtre
swings
shooting
at
a
mark
with
and
little
pellets
of
clay
and
smashing
little
plaster
figures
and
winning
macaroons
losing
one
self
in
the
beautiful
forest
catching
newts
and
tadpoles
and
young
frogs
making
music
on
mirlitons
trilby
singing
ben
bolt
into
a
mirliton
was
a
thing
to
be
remembered
whether
one
would
or
no
trilby
on
this
occasion
came
out
in
a
new
character
with
a
little
black
bonnet
and
a
gray
jacket
of
her
own
making
to
look
at
but
for
her
loose
heelless
silk
boots
laced
up
the
inner
side
she
might
have
been
the
daughter
of
an
english
dean
until
she
undertook
to
teach
the
laird
some
favorite
cancan
steps
and
then
the
laird
himself
it
must
be
admitted
no
longer
looked
like
the
son
of
a
worthy
scotch
solicitor
this
was
after
dinner
in
the
garden
at
la
loge
du
garde
champêtre
taffy
and
jeannot
and
little
billee
made
the
necessary
music
on
their
mirlitons
and
the
dancing
soon
became
general
with
plenty
also
to
look
on
for
the
garde
had
many
customers
who
dined
there
on
summer
sundays
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
trilby
was
far
and
away
the
belle
of
that
particular
ball
and
there
have
been
worse
balls
in
much
finer
company
and
far
plainer
women
trilby
lightly
dancing
the
cancan
there
are
cancans
and
cancans
was
a
singularly
gainly
and
seductive
person
vera
incessu
patuit
here
again
she
was
funny
without
being
vulgar
and
for
mere
grace
even
in
the
cancan
she
was
the
forerunner
of
miss
kate
vaughan
and
for
sheer
fun
the
precursor
of
miss
nelly
farren
and
the
laird
trying
to
dance
after
her
dongsong
le
konkong
as
he
called
it
was
too
funny
for
words
and
if
genuine
popular
success
is
a
true
test
of
humor
no
greater
humorist
ever
danced
a
illustration
de
hom
ker
jer
swee
what
englishmen
could
do
in
france
during
the
fifties
and
yet
manage
to
preserve
their
and
even
the
respect
of
their
respectable
french
friends
voilà
de
hom
ker
jer
swee
said
the
laird
every
time
he
bowed
in
acknowledgment
of
the
applause
that
greeted
his
performance
of
various
solo
steps
of
his
own
scotch
reels
and
that
come
in
admirably
then
one
fine
day
the
laird
fell
ill
and
the
doctor
had
to
be
sent
for
and
he
ordered
a
nurse
but
trilby
would
hear
of
no
nurses
not
even
a
sister
of
charity
she
did
all
the
nursing
herself
and
never
slept
a
wink
for
three
successive
days
and
nights
on
the
third
day
the
laird
was
out
of
all
danger
the
delirium
was
past
and
the
doctor
found
poor
trilby
fast
asleep
by
the
bedside
madame
vinard
at
the
bedroom
door
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
and
whispered
quel
bonheur
il
est
sauvé
le
docteur
écoutez
il
dit
ses
prières
en
anglais
ce
brave
garçon
the
good
old
doctor
who
did
understand
a
word
of
english
listened
and
heard
the
laird
voice
weak
and
low
but
quite
clear
and
full
of
fervor
intoning
solemnly
herbs
red
peppers
mussels
saffron
soles
onions
garlic
roach
and
dace
all
these
you
eat
at
terré
tavern
in
that
one
dish
of
bouillabaisse
ah
mais
très
bien
de
sa
part
ce
brave
jeune
homme
rendre
grâces
au
ciel
comme
cela
quand
le
danger
est
passé
très
bien
très
bien
sceptic
and
voltairian
as
he
was
and
not
the
friend
of
prayer
the
good
doctor
was
touched
for
he
was
old
and
therefore
kind
and
tolerant
and
made
allowances
and
afterwards
he
said
such
sweet
things
to
trilby
about
it
all
and
about
her
admirable
care
of
his
patient
that
she
positively
wept
with
delight
like
sweet
alice
with
hair
so
brown
whenever
ben
bolt
gave
her
a
smile
all
this
sounds
very
but
it
true
so
it
will
be
easily
understood
how
the
trois
angliches
came
in
time
to
feel
for
trilby
quite
a
peculiar
regard
and
looked
forward
with
sorrowful
forebodings
to
the
day
when
this
singular
and
pleasant
little
quartet
would
have
to
be
broken
up
each
of
them
to
spread
his
wings
and
fly
away
on
his
own
account
and
poor
trilby
to
be
left
behind
all
by
herself
they
would
even
frame
little
plans
whereby
she
might
better
herself
in
life
and
avoid
the
many
snares
and
pitfalls
that
would
beset
her
lonely
path
in
the
quartier
latin
when
they
were
gone
trilby
never
thought
of
such
things
as
these
she
took
short
views
of
life
and
troubled
herself
about
no
morrows
there
was
however
one
jarring
figure
in
her
little
fool
paradise
a
baleful
and
most
ominous
figure
that
constantly
crossed
her
path
and
came
between
her
and
the
sun
and
threw
its
shadow
over
her
and
that
was
svengali
he
also
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
studio
in
the
place
anatole
where
much
was
forgiven
him
for
the
sake
of
his
music
especially
when
he
came
with
gecko
and
they
made
music
together
but
it
soon
became
apparent
that
they
did
not
come
there
to
play
to
the
three
angliches
it
was
to
see
trilby
whom
they
both
had
taken
it
into
their
heads
to
adore
each
in
a
different
fashion
gecko
with
a
humble
doglike
worship
that
expressed
itself
in
mute
pathetic
deference
and
looks
of
lowly
of
apology
for
his
own
unworthy
existence
as
though
the
only
requital
he
would
ever
dare
to
dream
of
were
a
word
of
decent
politeness
a
glance
of
tolerance
or
a
mere
bone
to
a
dog
svengali
was
a
bolder
wooer
when
he
cringed
it
was
with
a
mock
humility
full
of
sardonic
threats
when
he
was
playful
it
was
with
a
terrible
playfulness
like
that
of
a
cat
with
a
mouse
a
weird
ungainly
cat
and
most
unclean
a
sticky
haunting
long
lean
uncanny
black
if
there
is
such
an
animal
outside
a
bad
dream
it
was
a
great
grievance
to
him
that
she
had
suffered
from
no
more
pains
in
her
eyes
she
had
but
preferred
to
endure
them
rather
than
seek
relief
from
him
so
he
would
playfully
try
to
mesmerize
her
with
his
glance
and
sidle
up
nearer
and
nearer
to
her
making
passes
and
with
stern
command
in
his
eyes
till
she
would
shake
and
shiver
and
almost
sicken
with
fear
and
all
but
feel
the
spell
come
over
her
as
in
a
nightmare
and
rouse
herself
with
a
great
effort
and
escape
if
taffy
were
there
he
would
interfere
with
a
friendly
now
then
old
fellow
none
of
that
and
a
jolly
slap
on
the
back
which
would
make
svengali
cough
for
an
hour
and
paralyze
his
mesmeric
powers
for
a
week
svengali
had
a
stroke
of
he
played
at
three
grand
concerts
with
gecko
and
had
a
success
he
even
gave
a
concert
of
his
own
which
made
a
furor
and
blossomed
out
into
beautiful
and
costly
clothes
of
quite
original
color
and
shape
and
pattern
so
that
people
would
turn
round
and
stare
at
him
in
the
street
a
thing
he
loved
he
felt
his
fortune
was
secure
and
ran
into
debt
with
tailors
hatters
shoemakers
jewellers
but
paid
none
of
his
old
debts
to
his
friends
his
pockets
were
always
full
of
printed
slips
things
that
had
been
written
about
him
in
the
papers
and
he
would
read
them
aloud
to
everybody
he
knew
especially
to
trilby
as
she
sat
darning
socks
on
the
while
the
fencing
and
boxing
were
in
train
and
he
would
lay
his
fame
and
his
fortune
at
her
feet
on
condition
that
she
should
share
her
life
with
him
ach

he
would
say
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
a

with
his
stinking
sitting

in
his
corner
his
mahlstick
and
his
palette
in
one
hand
and
his
twiddling
little
footle
brush
in
the
other
what
noise
does
make
when
his
little
fool
of
a
picture
is
finished
he
will
send
it
to
london
and
they
will
hang
it
on
a
wall
with
a
lot
of
others
all
in
a
line
like
recruits
called
out
for
inspection
and
the
yawning
public
will
walk
by
in
procession
and
inspect
and
say
svengali
will
go
to
london
ha
ha
he
will
be
all
alone
on
a
platform
and
play
as
nobody
else
can
play
and
hundreds
of
beautiful

will
see
and
hear
and
go
mad
with
love
for

they
will
soon
lose
their
serenity
and
their
highness
when
they
hear
svengali
they
will
invite
him
to
their
palaces
and
pay
him

you

when

is
talking
look
a
little
lower
down
between
the
houses
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
there
is
a
little
ugly
gray
building
there
and
inside
are
eight
slanting
slabs
of
brass
all
of
a
row
like
beds
in
a

and
one
fine
day
you
shall
lie
asleep
on
one
of
those
slabs
you
drilpy
who
would
not
listen
to
svengali
and
therefore
lost
him
and
over
the
middle
of
you
will
be
a
little
leather
apron
and
over
your
head
a
little
brass
tap
and
all
day
long
and
all
night
the
cold
water
shall
trickle
trickle
trickle
all
the
way
down
your
beautiful
white
body
to
your
beautiful
white
feet
till
they
turn
green
and
your
poor
damp
draggled
muddy
rags
will
hang
above
you
from
the
ceiling
for
your
friends
to
know
you
by
drip
drip
drip
but
you
will
have
no
friends
and
people
of
all
sorts
strangers
will
stare
at
you
through
the
big
windows
englanders
chiffonniers
painters
and
sculptors
workmen
pioupious
old
hags
of
and
say
what
a
beautiful
woman
was
that
look
at
her
she
ought
to
be
rolling
in
her
carriage
and
pair
and
just
then
who
should
come
by
rolling
in
his
carriage
and
pair
smothered
in
furs
and
smoking
a
big
cigar
of
the
havana
but
svengali
who
will
jump
out
and
push
the
canaille
aside
and
say
ha
that
is
la
grande
drilpy
who
would
not
listen
to
svengali
but
looked
at
the
when
he
told
her
of
his
manly
love
and
hi
damn
it
svengali
what
the
devil
are
you
talking
to
trilby
about
you
making
her
sick
ca
you
see
leave
off
and
go
to
the
piano
man
or
i
come
and
slap
you
on
the
back
again
thus
would
that
sweating
bullock
of
an
englander
stop
svengali
and
release
trilby
from
bad
quarters
of
an
hour
then
svengali
who
had
a
wholesome
dread
of
the
bullock
would
go
to
the
piano
and
make
impossible
discords
and
say
dear
drilpy
come
and
sing
polt
i
am
thirsting
for
those
so
beautiful
chest
notes
come
poor
trilby
needed
little
pressing
when
she
was
asked
to
sing
and
would
go
through
her
lamentable
performance
to
the
great
discomfort
of
little
billee
it
lost
nothing
of
its
grotesqueness
from
accompaniment
which
was
a
triumph
of
cacophony
and
he
would
encourage
her
très
pien
très
pien
ça
y
est
when
it
was
over
svengali
would
test
her
ear
as
he
called
it
and
strike
the
c
in
the
middle
and
then
the
f
just
above
and
ask
which
was
the
highest
and
she
would
declare
they
were
both
exactly
the
same
it
was
only
when
he
struck
a
note
in
the
bass
and
another
in
the
treble
that
she
could
perceive
any
difference
and
said
that
the
first
sounded
like
père
martin
blowing
up
his
wife
and
the
second
like
her
little
godson
trying
to
make
the
peace
between
them
she
was
quite
and
did
know
it
and
he
would
pay
her
extravagant
compliments
on
her
musical
talent
till
taffy
would
say
look
here
svengali
let
hear
sing
a
song
and
he
would
tickle
him
so
masterfully
under
the
ribs
that
the
creature
howled
and
became
quite
hysterical
then
svengali
would
vent
his
love
of
teasing
on
little
billee
and
pin
arms
behind
his
back
and
swing
him
round
saying
himmel
this
for
an
arm
it
like
a
girl
it
strong
enough
to
paint
said
little
billee
and
what
this
for
a
leg
it
like
a
mahlstick
it
strong
enough
to
kick
if
you
do
leave
off
and
little
billee
the
young
and
tender
would
let
out
his
little
heel
and
kick
the
german
shins
and
just
as
the
german
was
going
to
retaliate
big
taffy
would
pin
arms
and
make
him
sing
another
song
more
discordant
than
trilby
for
he
did
dream
of
kicking
taffy
of
that
you
may
be
sure
such
was
svengali
only
to
be
endured
for
the
sake
of
his
music
always
ready
to
vex
frighten
bully
or
torment
anybody
or
anything
smaller
and
weaker
than
himself

one
lovely
monday
morning
in
late
september
at
about
eleven
or
so
taffy
and
the
laird
sat
in
the
studio
each
opposite
his
picture
smoking
nursing
his
knee
and
saying
nothing
the
heaviness
of
monday
weighed
on
their
spirits
more
than
usual
for
the
three
friends
had
returned
late
on
the
previous
night
from
a
week
spent
at
barbizon
and
in
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
a
heavenly
week
among
the
painters
rousseau
millet
corot
daubigny
let
us
suppose
and
others
less
known
to
fame
this
day
little
billee
especially
had
been
fascinated
by
all
this
artistic
life
in
blouses
and
sabots
and
immense
straw
hats
and
panamas
and
had
sworn
to
himself
and
to
his
friends
that
he
would
some
day
live
and
die
there
painting
the
forest
as
it
is
and
peopling
it
with
beautiful
people
out
of
his
own
fancy
leading
a
healthy
life
of
simple
wants
and
lofty
aspirations
at
length
taffy
said
bother
work
this
morning
i
feel
much
more
like
a
stroll
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
and
lunch
at
the
café
de
where
the
omelets
are
good
and
the
wine
is
blue
the
very
thing
i
was
thinking
of
myself
said
the
laird
illustration
the
happy
life
so
taffy
slipped
on
his
old
and
his
old
harrow
cricket
cap
with
the
peak
turned
the
wrong
way
and
the
laird
put
on
an
old
of
taffy
that
reached
to
his
heels
and
a
battered
straw
hat
they
had
found
in
the
studio
when
they
took
it
and
both
sallied
forth
into
the
mellow
sunshine
on
the
way
to
carrel
for
they
meant
to
seduce
little
billee
from
his
work
that
he
might
share
in
their
laziness
greediness
and
general
demoralization
and
whom
should
they
meet
coming
down
the
narrow
turreted
old
rue
vieille
des
mauvais
ladres
but
little
billee
himself
with
an
air
of
general
demoralization
so
tragic
that
they
were
quite
alarmed
he
had
his
and
in
one
hand
and
his
little
valise
in
the
other
he
was
pale
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
his
hair
staring
all
at
sixes
and
sevens
like
a
sick
scotch
terrier
good
lord
what
the
matter
said
taffy
oh
oh
oh
she
sitting
at
carrel
who
sitting
at
carrel
trilby
sitting
to
all
those
ruffians
there
she
was
just
as
i
opened
the
door
i
saw
her
i
tell
you
the
sight
of
her
was
like
a
blow
between
the
eyes
and
i
bolted
i
shall
never
go
back
to
that
beastly
hole
again
i
off
to
barbizon
to
paint
the
forest
i
was
coming
round
to
tell
you
stop
a
minute
are
you
mad
said
taffy
collaring
him
let
me
go
taffy
let
me
go
damn
it
i
come
back
in
a
week
but
going
now
let
me
go
do
you
hear
but
look
here
i
go
with
you
no
i
want
to
be
alone
quite
alone
let
me
go
i
tell
you
i
let
you
go
unless
you
swear
to
me
on
your
honor
that
write
directly
you
get
there
and
every
day
till
you
come
back
swear
all
right
i
swear
honor
bright
now
there
back
on
sunday
and
he
was
off
now
what
the
devil
does
all
that
mean
asked
taffy
much
perturbed
i
suppose
he
shocked
at
seeing
trilby
in
that
guise
or
disguise
or
unguise
sitting
at
carrel
he
such
an
odd
little
chap
and
i
must
say
i
surprised
at
trilby
it
a
bad
thing
for
her
when
we
away
what
could
have
induced
her
she
never
sat
in
a
studio
of
that
kind
before
i
thought
she
only
sat
to
durien
and
old
carrel
they
walked
for
a
while
in
silence
do
you
know
i
got
a
horrid
idea
that
the
little
fool
in
love
with
her
i
long
had
a
horrid
idea
that
in
love
with
that
would
be
a
very
stupid
business
said
taffy
they
walked
on
brooding
over
those
two
horrid
ideas
and
the
more
they
brooded
considered
and
remembered
the
more
convinced
they
became
that
both
were
right
here
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
said
the
laird
and
talking
of
fish
let
go
and
lunch
and
so
demoralized
were
they
that
taffy
ate
three
omelets
without
thinking
and
the
laird
drank
two
of
wine
and
taffy
three
and
they
walked
about
the
whole
of
that
afternoon
for
fear
trilby
should
come
to
the
studio
and
were
very
unhappy
this
is
how
trilby
came
to
sit
at
carrel
studio
carrel
had
suddenly
taken
it
into
his
head
that
he
would
spend
a
week
there
and
paint
a
figure
among
his
pupils
that
they
might
see
and
paint
with
and
if
possible
like
him
and
he
had
asked
trilby
as
a
great
favor
to
be
the
model
and
trilby
was
so
devoted
to
the
great
carrel
that
she
readily
consented
so
that
monday
morning
found
her
there
and
carrel
posed
her
as
ingres
famous
figure
in
his
picture
called
la
source
holding
a
stone
pitcher
on
her
shoulder
illustration
me
go
taffy
and
the
work
began
in
religious
silence
then
in
five
minutes
or
so
little
billee
came
bursting
in
and
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
her
he
stopped
and
stood
as
one
petrified
his
shoulders
up
his
eyes
staring
then
lifting
his
arms
he
turned
and
fled
ce
a
donc
ce
litrebili
exclaimed
one
or
two
students
for
they
had
turned
his
english
nickname
into
french
perhaps
he
forgotten
something
said
another
perhaps
forgotten
to
brush
his
teeth
and
part
his
hair
perhaps
he
forgotten
to
say
his
prayers
said
barizel
he
come
back
i
hope
exclaimed
the
master
and
the
incident
gave
rise
to
no
further
comment
but
trilby
was
much
disquieted
and
fell
to
wondering
what
on
earth
was
the
matter
at
first
she
wondered
in
french
french
of
the
quartier
latin
she
had
not
seen
little
billee
for
a
week
and
wondered
if
he
were
she
had
looked
forward
so
much
to
his
painting
her
painting
her
beautifully
and
hoped
he
would
soon
come
back
and
lose
no
time
then
she
began
to
wonder
in
english
nice
clean
english
of
the
studio
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
her
father
english
and
suddenly
a
quick
thought
pierced
her
through
and
through
and
made
the
flesh
tingle
on
her
insteps
and
the
backs
of
her
hands
and
bathed
her
brow
and
temples
with
sweat
she
had
good
eyes
and
little
billee
had
a
singularly
expressive
face
could
it
possibly
be
that
he
was
at
seeing
her
sitting
there
she
knew
that
he
was
peculiar
in
many
ways
she
remembered
that
neither
he
nor
taffy
nor
the
laird
had
ever
asked
her
to
sit
for
the
figure
though
she
would
have
been
only
too
delighted
to
do
so
for
them
she
also
remembered
how
little
billee
had
always
been
silent
whenever
she
alluded
to
her
posing
for
the
altogether
as
she
called
it
and
had
sometimes
looked
pained
and
always
very
grave
she
turned
alternately
pale
and
red
pale
and
red
all
over
again
and
again
as
the
thought
grew
up
in
her
and
soon
the
growing
thought
became
a
torment
illustration
ce
a
donc
ce
litrebili
this
feeling
of
shame
was
unendurable
its
birth
a
travail
that
racked
and
rent
every
fibre
of
her
moral
being
and
she
suffered
agonies
beyond
anything
she
had
ever
felt
in
her
life
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
child
are
you
ill
asked
carrel
who
like
every
one
else
was
very
fond
of
her
and
to
whom
she
had
sat
as
a
child
de
psyché
now
in
the
luxembourg
gallery
was
painted
from
her
she
shook
her
head
and
the
work
went
on
presently
she
dropped
her
pitcher
that
broke
into
bits
and
putting
her
two
hands
to
her
face
she
burst
into
tears
and
sobs
and
there
to
the
amazement
of
everybody
she
stood
crying
like
a
big
baby
la
source
aux
larmes
what
the
matter
my
poor
dear
child
said
carrel
jumping
up
and
helping
her
off
the
throne
oh
i
do
know
i
do
know
i
ill
very
ill
let
me
go
home
and
with
kind
solicitude
and
despatch
they
helped
her
on
with
her
clothes
and
carrel
sent
for
a
cab
and
took
her
home
and
on
the
way
she
dropped
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
wept
and
told
him
all
about
it
as
well
as
she
could
and
monsieur
carrel
had
tears
in
his
eyes
too
and
wished
to
heaven
he
had
never
induced
her
to
sit
for
the
figure
either
then
or
at
any
other
time
and
pondering
deeply
and
sorrowfully
on
such
terrible
responsibility
he
had
daughters
of
his
own
he
went
back
to
the
studio
and
in
an
hour
time
they
got
another
model
and
another
pitcher
and
went
to
work
again
and
trilby
as
she
lay
disconsolate
on
her
bed
all
that
day
and
all
the
next
and
all
the
next
again
thought
of
her
past
life
with
agonies
of
shame
and
remorse
that
made
the
pain
in
her
eyes
seem
as
a
light
and
welcome
relief
for
it
came
and
tortured
worse
and
lasted
longer
than
it
had
ever
done
before
but
she
soon
found
to
her
miserable
bewilderment
that
are
the
worst
of
all
then
she
decided
that
she
must
write
to
one
of
the
trois
angliches
and
chose
the
laird
she
was
more
familiar
with
him
than
with
the
other
two
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
familiar
with
the
laird
if
he
liked
one
as
he
was
so
and
demonstrative
for
all
that
he
was
such
a
canny
scot
then
she
had
nursed
him
through
his
illness
she
had
often
hugged
and
kissed
him
before
the
whole
studio
full
of
people
and
even
when
alone
with
him
it
had
always
seemed
quite
natural
for
her
to
do
so
it
was
like
a
child
caressing
a
favorite
young
uncle
or
elder
brother
and
though
the
good
laird
was
the
least
susceptible
of
mortals
he
would
often
find
these
innocent
blandishments
a
somewhat
trying
ordeal
she
had
never
taken
such
a
liberty
with
taffy
and
as
for
little
billee
she
would
sooner
have
died
so
she
wrote
to
the
laird
i
give
her
letter
without
the
spelling
which
was
often
faulty
although
her
nightly
readings
had
much
improved
it
my
dear
friend
i
am
very
unhappy
i
was
sitting
at
carrel
in
the
rue
des
potirons
and
little
billee
came
in
and
was
so
shocked
and
disgusted
that
he
ran
away
and
never
came
back
i
saw
it
all
in
his
face
i
sat
there
because
carrel
asked
me
to
he
has
always
been
very
kind
to
me
carrel
ever
since
i
was
a
child
and
i
would
do
anything
to
please
him
but
never
again
he
was
there
too
i
never
thought
anything
about
sitting
before
i
sat
first
as
a
child
to
carrel
mamma
made
me
and
made
me
promise
not
to
tell
papa
and
so
i
did
it
soon
seemed
as
natural
to
sit
for
people
as
to
run
errands
for
them
or
wash
and
mend
their
clothes
papa
would
have
liked
my
doing
that
either
though
we
wanted
the
money
badly
and
so
he
never
knew
i
have
sat
for
the
altogether
to
several
other
people
besides
gérôme
durien
the
two
hennequins
and
émile
baratier
and
for
the
head
and
hands
to
lots
of
people
and
for
the
feet
only
to
charles
faure
andré
besson
mathieu
dumoulin
and
collinet
nobody
else
it
seemed
as
natural
for
me
to
sit
as
for
a
man
now
i
see
the
awful
difference
and
i
have
done
dreadful
things
besides
as
you
must
know
as
all
the
quartier
knows
baratier
and
besson
but
not
durien
though
people
think
so
nobody
else
i
swear
except
old
monsieur
penque
at
the
beginning
who
was
mamma
friend
it
makes
me
almost
die
of
shame
and
misery
to
think
of
it
for
that
not
like
sitting
i
knew
how
wrong
it
was
all
along
and
there
no
excuse
for
me
none
though
lots
of
people
do
as
bad
and
nobody
in
the
quartier
seems
to
think
any
the
worse
of
them
if
you
and
taffy
and
little
billee
cut
me
i
really
think
i
shall
go
mad
and
die
without
your
friendship
i
should
care
to
live
a
bit
dear
sandy
i
love
your
little
finger
better
than
any
man
or
woman
i
ever
met
and
taffy
and
little
billee
little
fingers
too
illustration
repentance
what
shall
i
do
i
dare
go
out
for
fear
of
meeting
one
of
you
will
you
come
and
see
me
i
am
never
going
to
sit
again
not
even
for
the
face
and
hands
i
am
going
back
to
be
a
de
with
my
old
friend
angèle
boisse
who
is
getting
on
very
well
indeed
in
the
rue
des
cloîtres
ste
pétronille
you
come
and
see
me
wo
you
i
shall
be
in
all
day
till
you
do
or
else
i
will
meet
you
somewhere
if
you
will
tell
me
where
and
when
or
else
i
will
go
and
see
you
in
the
studio
if
you
are
sure
to
be
alone
please
do
keep
me
waiting
long
for
an
answer
you
do
know
what
i
suffering
your
faithful
friend
trilby
she
sent
this
letter
by
hand
and
the
laird
came
in
less
than
ten
minutes
after
she
had
sent
it
and
she
hugged
and
kissed
and
cried
over
him
so
that
he
was
almost
ready
to
cry
himself
but
he
burst
out
laughing
instead
which
was
better
and
more
in
his
line
and
very
much
more
comforting
and
talked
to
her
so
nicely
and
kindly
and
naturally
that
by
the
time
he
left
her
humble
attic
in
the
rue
des
her
very
aspect
which
had
quite
shocked
him
when
he
first
saw
her
had
almost
become
what
it
usually
was
the
little
room
under
the
leads
with
its
sloping
roof
and
mansard
window
was
as
scrupulously
neat
and
clean
as
if
its
tenant
had
been
a
holy
sister
who
taught
the
noble
daughters
of
france
at
some
convent
of
the
sacred
heart
there
were
nasturtiums
and
mignonette
on
the
outer
and
convolvulus
was
trained
to
climb
round
the
window
as
she
sat
by
his
side
on
the
narrow
white
bed
clasping
and
stroking
his
painty
turpentiny
hand
and
kissing
it
every
five
minutes
he
talked
to
her
like
a
father
as
he
told
taffy
afterwards
and
scolded
her
for
having
been
so
silly
as
not
to
send
for
him
directly
or
come
to
the
studio
he
said
how
glad
he
was
how
glad
they
would
all
be
that
she
was
going
to
give
up
sitting
for
the
figure
not
of
course
that
there
was
any
real
harm
in
it
but
it
was
better
not
and
especially
how
happy
it
would
make
them
to
feel
she
intended
to
live
straight
for
the
future
little
billee
was
to
remain
at
barbizon
for
a
little
while
but
she
must
promise
to
come
and
dine
with
taffy
and
himself
that
very
day
and
cook
the
dinner
and
when
he
went
back
to
his
picture
les
noces
du
toréador
saying
to
her
as
he
left
à
ce
soir
donc
mille
sacrés
tonnerres
de
nong
de
dew
he
left
the
happiest
woman
in
the
whole
latin
quarter
behind
him
she
had
confessed
and
been
forgiven
and
with
shame
and
repentance
and
confession
and
forgiveness
had
come
a
strange
new
feeling
that
of
a
dawning
hitherto
for
trilby
had
meant
little
more
than
the
mere
cleanliness
of
her
body
in
which
she
had
always
revelled
alas
it
was
one
of
the
conditions
of
her
humble
calling
it
now
meant
another
kind
of
cleanliness
and
she
would
luxuriate
in
it
for
evermore
and
the
dreadful
past
never
to
be
forgotten
by
her
should
be
so
lived
down
as
in
time
perhaps
to
be
forgotten
by
others
the
dinner
that
evening
was
a
memorable
one
for
trilby
after
she
had
washed
up
the
knives
and
forks
and
plates
and
dishes
and
put
them
by
she
sat
and
sewed
she
would
even
smoke
her
cigarette
it
reminded
her
so
of
things
and
scenes
she
now
hated
no
more
cigarettes
for
trilby
they
all
talked
of
little
billee
she
heard
about
the
way
he
had
been
brought
up
about
his
mother
and
sister
the
people
he
had
always
lived
among
she
also
heard
and
her
heart
alternately
rose
and
sank
as
she
listened
what
his
future
was
likely
to
be
and
how
rare
his
genius
was
and
how
great
if
his
friends
were
to
be
trusted
fame
and
fortune
would
soon
be
his
such
fame
and
fortune
as
fell
to
the
lot
of
very
few
unless
anything
should
happen
to
spoil
his
promise
and
mar
his
prospects
in
life
and
ruin
a
splendid
career
and
the
rising
of
the
heart
was
all
for
him
the
sinking
for
herself
how
could
she
ever
hope
to
be
even
the
friend
of
such
a
man
might
she
ever
hope
to
be
his
servant
his
faithful
humble
servant
little
billee
spent
a
month
at
barbizon
and
when
he
came
back
it
was
with
such
a
brown
face
that
his
friends
hardly
knew
him
and
he
brought
with
him
such
studies
as
made
his
friends
sit
up
the
crushing
sense
of
their
own
hopeless
inferiority
was
lost
in
wonder
at
his
work
in
love
and
enthusiasm
for
the
workman
illustration
confession
their
little
billee
so
young
and
tender
so
weak
of
body
so
strong
of
purpose
so
warm
of
heart
so
light
of
hand
so
keen
and
quick
and
piercing
of
brain
and
eye
was
their
master
to
be
stuck
on
a
pedestal
and
looked
up
to
and
bowed
down
to
to
be
watched
and
warded
and
worshipped
for
evermore
when
trilby
came
in
from
her
work
at
six
and
he
shook
hands
with
her
and
said
hullo
trilby
her
face
turned
pale
to
the
lips
her
quivered
and
she
gazed
down
at
him
for
she
was
among
the
tallest
of
her
sex
with
such
a
moist
hungry
look
of
humble
craving
adoration
that
the
laird
felt
his
worst
fears
were
realized
and
the
look
little
billee
sent
up
in
return
filled
the
manly
bosom
of
taffy
with
an
equal
apprehension
then
they
all
four
went
and
dined
together
at
le
père
trin
and
trilby
went
back
to
her
de
next
day
little
billee
took
his
work
to
show
carrel
and
carrel
invited
him
to
come
and
finish
his
picture
the
pitcher
goes
to
the
well
at
his
own
private
studio
an
favor
which
the
boy
accepted
with
a
thrill
of
proud
gratitude
and
affectionate
reverence
so
little
was
seen
for
some
time
of
little
billee
at
the
studio
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
and
little
of
trilby
a
de
has
not
many
minutes
to
spare
from
her
irons
but
they
often
met
at
dinner
and
on
sunday
mornings
trilby
came
to
repair
the
laird
linen
and
darn
his
socks
and
look
after
his
little
comforts
as
usual
and
spend
a
happy
day
and
on
sunday
afternoons
the
studio
would
be
as
lively
as
ever
with
the
fencing
and
boxing
the
and
fiddling
all
as
it
used
to
be
and
week
by
week
the
friends
noticed
a
gradual
and
subtle
change
in
trilby
she
was
no
longer
slangy
in
french
unless
it
were
now
and
then
by
a
slip
of
the
tongue
no
longer
so
facetious
and
droll
and
yet
she
seemed
even
happier
than
she
had
ever
seemed
before
also
she
grew
thinner
especially
in
the
face
where
the
bones
of
her
cheeks
and
jaw
began
to
show
themselves
and
these
bones
were
constructed
on
such
right
principles
as
were
those
of
her
brow
and
chin
and
the
bridge
of
her
nose
that
the
improvement
was
astonishing
almost
inexplicable
also
she
lost
her
freckles
as
the
summer
waned
and
she
herself
went
less
into
the
open
air
and
she
let
her
hair
grow
and
made
of
it
a
small
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
and
showed
her
little
flat
ears
which
were
charming
and
just
in
the
right
place
very
far
back
and
rather
high
little
billee
could
not
have
placed
them
better
himself
also
her
mouth
always
too
large
took
on
a
firmer
and
sweeter
outline
and
her
big
british
teeth
were
so
white
and
even
that
even
frenchmen
forgave
them
their
british
bigness
and
a
new
soft
brightness
came
into
her
eyes
that
no
one
had
ever
seen
there
before
they
were
stars
just
twin
gray
stars
or
rather
planets
just
thrown
off
by
some
new
sun
for
the
steady
mellow
light
they
gave
out
was
not
entirely
their
own
favorite
types
of
beauty
change
with
each
succeeding
generation
these
were
the
days
of
buckner
aristocratic
album
beauties
with
lofty
foreheads
oval
faces
little
aquiline
noses
little
mouths
soft
dimpled
chins
drooping
shoulders
and
long
side
ringlets
that
fell
over
them
the
lady
arabellas
and
the
lady
clementinas
musidoras
and
medoras
a
type
that
will
perhaps
come
back
to
us
some
day
may
the
present
scribe
be
dead
trilby
type
would
be
infinitely
more
admired
now
than
in
the
fifties
her
photograph
would
be
in
the
sir
edward
if
i
may
make
so
bold
as
to
say
so
would
perhaps
have
marked
her
for
his
own
in
spite
of
her
almost
too
exuberant
joyousness
and
irrepressible
vitality
rossetti
might
have
evolved
another
new
formula
from
her
sir
john
millais
another
old
one
of
the
kind
that
is
always
new
and
never
sates
nor
palls
like
clytie
let
us
say
ever
old
and
ever
new
as
love
itself
trilby
type
was
in
singular
contrast
to
the
type
gavarni
had
made
so
popular
in
the
latin
quarter
at
the
period
we
are
writing
of
so
that
those
who
fell
so
readily
under
her
charm
were
rather
apt
to
wonder
why
moreover
she
was
thought
much
too
tall
for
her
sex
and
her
day
and
her
station
in
life
and
especially
for
the
country
she
lived
in
she
hardly
looked
up
to
a
bold
gendarme
and
a
bold
gendarme
was
nearly
as
tall
as
a
dragon
de
la
garde
who
was
nearly
as
tall
as
an
average
english
policeman
not
that
she
was
a
giantess
by
any
means
she
was
about
as
tall
as
miss
ellen
terry
and
that
is
a
charming
height
think
illustration
all
as
it
used
to
be
one
day
taffy
remarked
to
the
laird
hang
it
i
blest
if
trilby
the
handsomest
woman
i
know
she
looks
like
a
grande
dame
masquerading
as
a
grisette
almost
like
a
joyful
saint
at
times
she
lovely
by
jove
i
could
stand
her
hugging
me
as
she
does
you
there
be
a
tragedy
say
the
slaughter
of
little
billee
ah
taffy
my
boy
rejoined
the
laird
when
those
long
sisterly
arms
are
round
my
neck
it
is
she
hugging
and
then
said
taffy
what
a
trump
she
is
why
she
as
upright
and
straight
and
honorable
as
a
man
and
what
she
says
to
one
about
self
is
always
so
pleasant
to
hear
that
irish
i
suppose
and
more
it
always
true
ah
that
scotch
said
the
laird
and
tried
to
wink
at
little
billee
but
little
billee
was
there

svengali
perceived
the
strange

afternoon

of
your
big
mouth
with
your
big
english
teeth
and
between
your
big
ribs
into
your
big
chest
where
the
big
leather
lungs
used
to
be
and
say
what
a
pity
she
had
no
more
music
in
her
than
a
big
tomcat
and
then
he
will
look
all
down
your
bones
to
your
poor
crumbling
feet
and
say
what
a
fool
she
was
not
to
answer
svengali
letters
and
the
dirty
carabins
shall
shut
up
you
sacred
fool
or
i
precious
soon
spoil
skeleton
for
you
thus
the
taffy
who
had
been
listening
then
svengali
scowling
would
play
chopin
funeral
march
more
divinely
than
ever
and
where
the
pretty
soft
part
comes
in
he
would
whisper
to
trilby
that
is
svengali
coming
to
look
at
you
in
your
little
mahogany
glass
case
and
here
let
me
say
that
these
vicious
imaginations
of
svengali
which
look
so
tame
in
english
print
sounded
much
more
ghastly
in
french
pronounced
with
a
accent
and
uttered
in
his
hoarse
rasping
nasal
throaty
rook
caw
his
big
yellow
teeth
baring
themselves
in
a
mongrel
canine
snarl
his
heavy
upper
eyelids
drooping
over
his
insolent
black
eyes
besides
which
as
he
played
the
lovely
melody
he
would
go
through
a
ghoulish
pantomime
as
though
he
were
taking
stock
of
the
different
bones
in
her
skeleton
with
greedy
but
discriminating
approval
and
when
he
came
down
to
the
feet
he
was
almost
droll
in
the
intensity
of
his
terrible
realism
but
trilby
did
not
appreciate
this
exquisite
fooling
and
felt
cold
all
over
he
seemed
to
her
a
dread
powerful
demon
who
but
for
taffy
who
alone
could
hold
him
in
check
oppressed
and
weighed
on
her
like
an
incubus
and
she
dreamed
of
him
oftener
than
she
dreamed
of
taffy
the
laird
or
even
little
billee
thus
pleasantly
and
smoothly
and
without
much
change
or
adventure
things
went
on
till
christmastime
little
billee
seldom
spoke
of
trilby
or
trilby
of
him
work
went
on
every
morning
at
the
studio
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
and
pictures
were
begun
and
finished
little
pictures
that
did
take
long
to
paint
the
laird
spanish
scenes
in
which
the
bull
never
appeared
and
which
he
sent
to
his
native
dundee
and
sold
there
taffy
tragic
little
dramas
of
life
in
the
slums
of
paris
starvings
drownings
suicides
by
charcoal
and
poison
which
he
sent
everywhere
but
did
not
sell
illustration
an
incubus
little
billee
was
painting
all
this
time
at
carrel
studio
his
private
one
and
seemed
preoccupied
and
happy
when
they
all
met
at
mealtime
and
less
talkative
even
than
usual
he
had
always
been
the
least
talkative
of
the
three
more
prone
to
listen
and
no
doubt
to
think
the
more
in
the
afternoon
people
came
and
went
as
usual
and
boxed
and
fenced
and
did
gymnastic
feats
and
felt
taffy
biceps
which
by
this
time
equalled
sandow
some
of
these
people
were
very
pleasant
and
remarkable
and
have
become
famous
since
then
in
england
france
america
or
have
died
or
married
and
come
to
grief
or
glory
in
other
ways
it
is
the
ballad
of
the
bouillabaisse
all
over
again
it
might
be
worth
while
my
trying
to
sketch
some
of
the
more
noteworthy
now
that
my
story
is
slowing
for
a
while
like
a
french
train
when
the
sees
a
long
curved
tunnel
in
front
of
him
as
i
do
and
no
light
at
the
other
end
my
humble
attempts
at
characterization
might
be
useful
as
mémoires
pour
servir
to
future
biographers
besides
there
are
other
reasons
as
the
reader
will
soon
discover
there
was
durien
for
instance
trilby
especial
french
adorer
pour
le
bon
motif
a
son
of
the
people
a
splendid
sculptor
a
very
fine
character
in
every
way
so
perfect
indeed
that
there
is
less
to
say
about
him
than
any
of
the
others
modest
earnest
simple
frugal
chaste
and
of
untiring
industry
living
for
his
art
and
perhaps
also
a
little
for
trilby
whom
he
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
marry
he
was
pygmalion
she
was
his
galatea
a
galatea
whose
marble
heart
would
never
beat
for
durien
house
is
now
the
finest
in
the
parc
monceau
his
wife
and
daughters
are
the
women
in
paris
and
he
one
of
the
happiest
of
men
but
he
will
never
quite
forget
poor
galatea
la
belle
aux
pieds
aux
deux
talons
de
rose
then
there
was
vincent
a
yankee
medical
student
who
could
both
work
and
play
he
is
now
one
of
the
greatest
oculists
in
the
world
and
europeans
cross
the
atlantic
to
consult
him
he
can
still
play
and
when
he
crosses
the
atlantic
himself
for
that
purpose
he
has
to
travel
incognito
like
a
royalty
lest
his
play
should
be
marred
by
work
and
his
daughters
are
so
beautiful
and
accomplished
that
british
dukes
have
sighed
after
them
in
vain
indeed
these
fair
young
ladies
spend
their
autumn
holiday
in
refusing
the
british
aristocracy
we
are
told
so
in
the
society
papers
and
i
can
quite
believe
it
love
is
not
always
blind
and
if
he
is
vincent
is
the
man
to
cure
him
in
those
days
he
prescribed
for
us
all
round
and
punched
and
stethoscoped
us
and
looked
at
our
tongues
for
love
and
told
us
what
to
eat
drink
and
avoid
and
even
where
to
go
for
it
for
instance
late
one
night
little
billee
woke
up
in
a
cold
sweat
and
thought
himself
a
dying
man
he
had
felt
seedy
all
day
and
taken
no
food
so
he
dressed
and
dragged
himself
to
vincent
hotel
and
woke
him
up
and
said
oh
vincent
vincent
i
a
dying
man
and
all
but
fainted
on
his
bed
vincent
felt
him
all
over
with
the
greatest
care
and
asked
him
many
questions
then
looking
at
his
watch
he
delivered
himself
thus
humph
rather
late
but
still
look
here
little
billee
do
you
know
the
halle
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
where
they
sell
vegetables
oh
yes
yes
what
vegetable
shall
i
listen
on
the
north
side
are
two
restaurants
bordier
and
baratte
they
remain
open
all
night
now
go
straight
off
to
one
of
those
tuck
shops
and
tuck
in
as
big
a
supper
as
you
possibly
can
some
people
prefer
baratte
i
prefer
bordier
myself
perhaps
you
better
try
bordier
first
and
baratte
after
at
all
events
lose
no
time
so
off
you
go
thus
he
saved
little
billee
from
an
early
grave
then
there
was
the
greek
a
boy
of
only
sixteen
but
six
feet
high
and
looking
ten
years
older
than
he
was
and
able
to
smoke
even
stronger
tobacco
than
taffy
himself
and
color
pipes
divinely
he
was
a
great
favorite
in
the
place
anatole
for
his
his
niceness
his
warm
geniality
he
was
the
capitalist
of
this
select
circle
and
nobly
lavish
of
his
capital
he
went
by
the
name
of
poluphloisboiospaleapologos
petrilopetrolicoconose
for
so
he
was
christened
by
the
laird
because
his
real
name
was
thought
much
too
long
and
much
too
lovely
for
the
quartier
latin
and
reminded
one
of
the
isles
of
greece
where
burning
sappho
loved
and
sang
what
was
he
learning
in
the
latin
quarter
french
he
spoke
french
like
a
native
nobody
knows
but
when
his
paris
friends
transferred
their
bohemia
to
london
where
were
they
ever
made
happier
and
more
at
home
than
in
his
lordly
parental
abode
or
fed
with
nicer
things
illustration
the
capitalist
and
the
swell
that
abode
is
now
his
and
lordlier
than
ever
as
becomes
the
dwelling
of
a
millionaire
and
city
magnate
and
its
owner
is
as
genial
as
jolly
and
as
hospitable
as
in
the
old
paris
days
but
he
no
longer
colors
pipes
then
there
was
carnegie
fresh
from
balliol
redolent
of
the
he
intended
himself
then
for
the
diplomatic
service
and
came
to
paris
to
learn
french
as
it
is
spoke
and
spent
most
of
his
time
with
his
fashionable
english
friends
on
the
right
side
of
the
river
and
the
rest
with
taffy
the
laird
and
little
billee
on
the
left
perhaps
that
is
why
he
has
not
become
an
ambassador
he
is
now
only
a
rural
dean
and
speaks
the
worst
french
i
know
and
speaks
it
wherever
and
whenever
he
can
it
serves
him
right
i
think
he
was
fond
of
lords
and
knew
some
at
least
he
gave
one
that
impression
and
often
talked
of
them
and
dressed
so
beautifully
that
even
little
billee
was
abashed
in
his
presence
only
taffy
in
his
threadbare
and
cricket
cap
and
the
laird
in
his
tattered
straw
hat
and
taffy
old
overcoat
down
to
his
heels
dared
to
walk
arm
in
arm
with
him
nay
insisted
on
doing
so
as
they
listened
to
the
band
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
and
his
whiskers
were
even
longer
and
thicker
and
more
golden
than
taffy
own
but
the
mere
sight
of
a
made
him
sick
then
there
was
the
antony
a
swiss
the
idle
apprentice
le
roi
des
truands
as
we
called
him
to
whom
everything
was
forgiven
as
to
françois
villon
cause
de
ses
surely
for
all
his
reprehensible
pranks
the
gentlest
and
most
lovable
creature
that
ever
lived
in
bohemia
or
out
of
it
always
in
debt
like
svengali
for
he
had
no
more
notion
of
the
value
of
money
than
a
and
gave
away
in
reckless
generosity
to
friends
what
in
strictness
belonged
to
his
endless
creditors
like
svengali
humorous
witty
and
a
most
exquisite
and
original
artist
and
also
somewhat
eccentric
in
his
attire
though
scrupulously
clean
so
that
people
would
stare
at
him
as
he
walked
along
a
thing
that
always
gave
him
dire
offence
but
unlike
svengali
full
of
delicacy
refinement
and
distinction
of
mind
and
manner
void
of
any
and
in
spite
of
the
irregularities
of
his
life
the
very
soul
of
truth
and
honor
as
gentle
as
he
was
chivalrous
and
brave
the
warmest
stanchest
sincerest
most
unselfish
friend
in
the
world
and
as
long
as
his
purse
was
full
the
best
and
drollest
boon
companion
in
the
world
but
that
was
not
forever
when
the
money
was
gone
then
would
antony
hie
him
to
some
beggarly
attic
in
some
lost
parisian
slum
and
write
his
own
epitaph
in
lovely
french
or
german
verse
or
even
english
for
he
was
an
astounding
linguist
and
telling
himself
that
he
was
forsaken
by
family
friends
and
mistress
alike
look
out
of
his
casement
over
the
paris
for
the
last
time
and
listen
once
more
to
the
harmonies
of
nature
as
he
called
it
and
aspire
towards
the
infinite
and
bewail
the
cruel
deceptions
of
his
life
and
finally
lay
himself
down
to
die
of
sheer
starvation
and
as
he
lay
and
waited
for
his
release
that
was
so
long
in
coming
he
would
beguile
the
weary
hours
by
mumbling
a
crust
watered
with
his
own
salt
tears
and
decorating
his
epitaph
with
fanciful
designs
of
the
most
exquisite
humor
pathos
and
beauty
these
illustrated
epitaphs
of
the
young
antony
of
which
there
exists
a
goodly
number
are
now
priceless
as
all
collectors
know
all
over
the
world
fainter
and
fainter
would
he
grow
and
finally
on
the
third
day
or
thereabouts
a
remittance
would
reach
him
from
some
sister
or
aunt
in
far
lausanne
or
else
the
fickle
mistress
or
faithless
friend
who
had
been
looking
for
him
all
over
paris
would
discover
his
the
beautiful
epitaph
would
be
walked
off
in
triumph
to
le
père
marcas
in
the
rue
du
ghette
and
sold
for
twenty
fifty
a
hundred
francs
and
then
la
galére
and
back
again
to
bohemia
dear
bohemia
and
all
its
joys
as
long
as
the
money
lasted
poi
da
capo
and
now
that
his
name
is
a
household
word
in
two
hemispheres
and
he
himself
an
honor
and
a
glory
to
the
land
he
has
adopted
as
his
own
he
loves
to
remember
all
this
and
look
back
from
the
lofty
pinnacle
on
which
he
sits
perched
up
aloft
to
the
impecunious
days
of
his
idle
apprenticeship
bon
temps
où
était
si
malheureux
and
with
all
that
quixotic
dignity
of
his
so
famous
is
he
as
a
wit
that
when
he
jokes
and
he
is
always
joking
people
laugh
first
and
then
ask
what
he
was
joking
about
and
you
can
even
make
your
own
mild
funniments
raise
a
roar
by
merely
prefacing
them
as
antony
once
said
the
present
scribe
has
often
done
so
and
if
by
a
happy
fluke
you
should
some
day
hit
upon
a
really
good
thing
of
your
own
good
enough
to
be
quoted
be
sure
it
will
come
back
to
you
after
many
days
prefaced
as
antony
once
said
and
these
jokes
are
so
that
you
almost
resent
their
being
made
at
anybody
expense
but
your
own
never
from
antony
the
aimless
jest
that
striking
has
caused
pain
the
idle
word
that
he
wish
back
again
indeed
in
spite
of
his
success
i
do
suppose
he
ever
made
an
enemy
in
his
life
and
here
let
me
add
lest
there
be
any
doubt
as
to
his
identity
that
he
is
now
tall
and
stout
and
strikingly
handsome
though
rather
bald
and
such
an
aristocrat
in
bearing
aspect
and
manner
that
you
would
take
him
for
a
descendant
of
the
crusaders
instead
of
the
son
of
a
respectable
burgher
in
lausanne
then
there
was
lorrimer
the
industrious
apprentice
who
is
now
also
on
high
himself
a
pillar
of
the
royal
academy
probably
if
he
lives
long
enough
its
future
president
the
duly
knighted
or
baroneted
lord
mayor
of
all
the
plastic
arts
except
one
or
two
perhaps
here
and
there
that
are
not
altogether
without
some
importance
may
this
not
be
for
many
many
years
lorrimer
himself
would
be
the
first
to
say
so
tall
thin
and
he
was
a
most
eager
earnest
and
painstaking
young
enthusiast
of
precocious
culture
who
read
improving
books
and
did
not
share
in
the
amusements
of
the
quartier
latin
but
spent
his
evenings
at
home
with
handel
michael
angelo
and
dante
on
the
respectable
side
of
the
river
also
he
went
into
good
society
sometimes
with
a
on
and
a
white
tie
and
his
hair
parted
in
the
middle
but
in
spite
of
these
blemishes
on
his
otherwise
exemplary
record
as
an
art
student
he
was
the
most
delightful
companion
the
most
affectionate
helpful
and
sympathetic
of
friends
may
he
live
long
and
prosper
enthusiast
as
he
was
he
could
only
worship
one
god
at
a
time
it
was
either
michael
angelo
phidias
paul
veronese
tintoret
raphael
or
titian
never
a
modern
moderns
did
exist
and
so
thoroughgoing
was
he
in
his
worship
and
so
persistent
in
voicing
it
that
he
made
those
immortals
quite
unpopular
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
we
grew
to
dread
their
very
names
each
of
them
would
last
him
a
couple
of
months
or
so
then
he
would
give
us
a
month
holiday
and
take
up
another
antony
did
not
think
much
of
lorrimer
in
those
days
nor
lorrimer
of
him
for
all
they
were
such
good
friends
and
neither
of
them
thought
much
of
little
billee
whose
pinnacle
of
pure
unadulterated
fame
is
now
the
highest
of
all
the
highest
probably
that
can
be
for
a
mere
painter
of
pictures
and
what
is
so
nice
about
lorrimer
now
that
he
is
a
graybeard
an
academician
an
accomplished
man
of
the
world
and
society
is
that
he
admires
antony
genius
more
than
he
can
say
and
reads
rudyard
kipling
delightful
stories
as
well
as
dante
inferno
and
can
listen
with
delight
to
the
lovely
songs
of
signor
tosti
who
has
not
precisely
founded
himself
on
handel
can
even
scream
with
laughter
at
a
comic
song
even
a
nigger
melody
so
at
least
that
it
but
be
sung
in
and
distinguished
company
for
lorrimer
is
no
bohemian
shoo
fly
bother
me
for
i
belong
to
the
g
both
these
famous
men
are
happily
and
most
beautifully
married
grandfathers
for
all
i
know
and
move
in
the
very
best
society
lorrimer
always
i
told
antony
now
and
then
la
haute
as
it
used
to
be
called
in
french
bohemia
meaning
dukes
and
lords
and
even
royalties
i
suppose
and
those
who
love
them
and
whom
they
love
that
the
best
society
is
it
at
all
events
we
are
assured
it
used
to
be
but
that
must
have
been
before
the
present
scribe
a
meek
and
somewhat
innocent
outsider
had
been
privileged
to
see
it
with
his
own
little
eye
and
when
they
happen
to
meet
there
antony
and
lorrimer
i
mean
i
do
expect
they
rush
very
wildly
into
each
other
arms
or
talk
very
fluently
about
old
times
nor
do
i
suppose
their
wives
are
very
intimate
none
of
our
wives
are
not
even
taffy
and
the
laird
oh
orestes
oh
pylades
oh
ye
impecunious
unpinnacled
young
inseparables
of
eighteen
nineteen
twenty
even
who
share
each
other
thoughts
and
purses
and
wear
each
other
clothes
and
swear
each
other
oaths
and
smoke
each
other
pipes
and
respect
each
other
lights
o
love
and
keep
each
other
secrets
and
tell
each
other
jokes
and
pawn
each
other
watches
and
merrymake
together
on
the
proceeds
and
sit
all
night
by
each
other
bedsides
in
sickness
and
comfort
each
other
in
sorrow
and
disappointment
with
silent
manly
sympathy
wait
till
you
get
to
forty
year
wait
even
till
each
or
either
of
you
gets
himself
a
little
pinnacle
of
his
own
be
it
ever
so
humble
nay
wait
till
either
or
each
of
you
gets
himself
a
wife
history
goes
on
repeating
itself
and
so
do
novels
and
this
is
a
platitude
and
there
nothing
new
under
the
sun
may
too
cecee
as
the
idiomatic
laird
would
say
in
the
language
he

then
there
was
dodor
the
handsome
young
dragon
de
la
garde
a
full
private
if
you
please
with
a
beardless
face
and
cheeks
and
a
small
waist
and
narrow
feet
like
a
lady
and
who
strange
to
say
spoke
english
just
like
an
englishman
and
his
friend
gontran
a
corporal
in
the
zouaves
both
of
these
worthies
had
met
taffy
in
the
crimea
and
frequented
the
studios
in
the
quartier
latin
where
they
adored
and
were
adored
by
the
grisettes
and
models
especially
trilby
both
of
them
were
distinguished
for
being
the
worst
subjects
plus
mauvais
of
their
respective
regiments
yet
both
were
special
favorites
not
only
with
their
but
with
those
in
command
from
their
colonels
downward
both
were
in
the
habit
of
being
promoted
to
the
rank
of
corporal
or
brigadier
and
degraded
to
the
rank
of
private
next
day
for
general
misconduct
the
result
of
a
too
exuberant
delight
in
their
promotion
neither
of
them
knew
fear
envy
malice
temper
or
low
spirits
ever
said
or
did
an
thing
ever
even
thought
one
ever
had
an
enemy
but
himself
both
had
the
best
or
the
worst
manners
going
according
to
their
company
whose
manners
they
reflected
they
were
true
chameleons
both
were
always
ready
to
share
their
last
piece
not
that
they
ever
seemed
to
have
one
with
each
other
or
anybody
else
or
anybody
else
last
piece
with
you
to
offer
you
a
friend
cigar
to
invite
you
to
dine
with
any
friend
they
had
to
fight
with
you
or
for
you
at
a
moment
notice
and
they
made
up
for
all
the
anxiety
tribulation
shame
and
sorrow
they
caused
at
home
by
the
endless
fun
and
amusement
they
gave
to
all
outside
it
was
a
pretty
dance
they
led
but
our
three
friends
of
the
place
anatole
who
had
got
to
pay
the
pipers
loved
them
both
especially
dodor
one
fine
sunday
afternoon
little
billee
found
himself
studying
life
and
character
in
that
most
delightful
and
festive
scene
la
fête
de
st
cloud
and
met
dodor
and
there
who
hailed
him
with
delight
saying
nous
allons
joliment
jubiler
nom
pipe
and
insisted
on
his
joining
in
their
amusements
and
paying
for
them
roundabouts
swings
the
giant
the
dwarf
the
strong
man
the
fat
woman
to
whom
they
made
love
and
were
taken
too
seriously
and
turned
out
the
menagerie
of
wild
beasts
whom
they
teased
and
aggravated
till
the
police
had
to
interfere
also
dances
where
their
cancan
step
was
of
the
wildest
and
most
unbridled
character
till
a
or
a
gendarme
came
in
sight
and
then
they
danced
quite
mincingly
and
demurely
maître
as
they
called
it
to
the
huge
delight
of
an
immense
and
crowd
and
the
disgust
of
all
truly
respectable
men
they
also
insisted
on
little
billee
walking
between
them
arm
in
arm
and
talking
to
them
in
english
whenever
they
saw
coming
towards
them
a
respectable
english
family
with
daughters
it
was
the
dragoon
delight
to
get
himself
stared
at
by
fair
daughters
of
albion
for
speaking
as
good
english
as
themselves
a
rare
accomplishment
in
a
french
trooper
and
zouzou
happiness
to
be
thought
english
too
though
the
only
english
he
knew
was
the
phrase
i
will
not
i
will
not
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
crimea
and
repeated
over
and
over
again
when
he
came
within
of
a
pretty
english
girl
little
billee
was
not
happy
in
these
circumstances
he
was
no
snob
but
he
was
a
respectably
young
briton
of
the
higher
middle
class
and
it
was
not
quite
pleasant
for
him
to
be
seen
by
fair
countrywomen
of
his
own
walking
arm
in
arm
on
a
sunday
afternoon
with
a
couple
of
french
private
soldiers
and
uncommonly
rowdy
ones
at
that
illustration
will
not
i
will
not
later
they
came
back
to
paris
together
on
the
top
of
an
omnibus
among
a
very
proletarian
crowd
and
there
the
two
facetious
warriors
immediately
made
themselves
pleasant
all
round
and
became
very
popular
especially
with
the
women
and
children
but
not
i
regret
to
say
through
the
propriety
refinement
and
discretion
of
their
behavior
little
billee
resolved
that
he
would
not
go
with
them
any
more
however
they
stuck
to
him
through
thick
and
thin
and
insisted
on
escorting
him
all
the
way
back
to
the
quartier
latin
by
the
pont
de
la
concorde
and
the
rue
de
lille
in
the
faubourg
germain
little
billee
loved
the
faubourg
germain
especially
the
rue
de
lille
he
was
fond
of
gazing
at
the
magnificent
old
mansions
the
hôtels
of
the
old
french
noblesse
or
rather
the
outside
walls
thereof
the
grand
sculptured
portals
with
the
armorial
bearings
and
the
splendid
old
historic
names
above
them
hôtel
de
this
hôtel
de
that
montmorency
la
la
tour
he
would
forget
himself
in
romantic
dreams
of
past
and
forgotten
french
chivalry
which
these
glorious
names
called
up
for
he
knew
a
little
of
french
history
loving
to
read
froissart
and
and
the
genial
brantôme
halting
opposite
one
of
the
finest
and
oldest
of
all
these
gateways

especial
favorite

letters

faded
gold
over
a
ducal
coronet
and
a
huge
escutcheon

began
to
descant
upon
its
architectural
beauties
and
noble
proportions
to
said
why
i
was
there
on
the
of

at
in

lucky

what
do

porter

at
this
juncture
the
two
great
gates
rolled
back
a
liveried

appeared
and
an
open
carriage
and
pair
came
out
and
in
it
were
two
elderly
ladies
and
a
younger
one
illustration
dodor
in
his
glory
to
little
billee
indignation
the
two
incorrigible
warriors
made
the
military
salute
and
the
three
ladies
bowed
stiffly
and
gravely
and
then
to
little
billee
horror
this
time
one
of
them
happened
to
look
back
and
zouzou
actually
kissed
his
hand
to
her
do
you
that
lady
asked
little

sternly

i
never

what

dodor
oh
i
only
a
humble
individual
and
answer
to
the
name
of
théodore
rigolot
de
lafarce
but
zouzou
an
awful
swell
you
know
his
brother
the
duke
illustration
hôtel
de
la
rochemartel
little
billee
was
no
snob
but
he
was
a
respectably
young
briton
of
the
higher
middle
class
and
these
revelations
which
he
could
not
but
believe
astounded
him
so
that
he
could
hardly
speak
much
as
he
flattered
himself
that
he
scorned
the
bloated
aristocracy
titles
are
titles
even
french
titles
and
when
it
comes
to
dukes
and
princesses
who
live
in
houses
like
the
hôtel
de
la
rochemartel
it
enough
to
take
a
respectably
young
briton
breath
away
when
he
saw
taffy
that
evening
he
exclaimed
i
say
zouzou
a
duchess
yes
the
duchesse
de
la
you
never
told
me
you
never
asked
me
it
one
of
the
greatest
names
in
france
very
poor
i
believe
poor
you
should
see
the
house
they
live
in
i
been
there
to
dinner
and
the
dinner
was
very
good
they
let
a
great
part
of
it
and
live
mostly
in
the
country
the
duke
is
brother
very
unlike
zouzou
he
consumptive
and
unmarried
and
the
most
respectable
man
in
paris
zouzou
will
be
the
duke
some
day
and
dodor
he
a
swell
too
i
suppose
he
says
he
something
or
other
yes
rigolot
de
lafarce
i
no
doubt
he
descends
from
the
crusaders
too
the
name
seems
to
favor
it
anyhow
and
such
lots
of
them
do
in
this
country
his
mother
was
english
and
bore
the
worthy
name
of
brown
he
was
at
school
in
england
that
why
he
speaks
english
so
well
and
behaves
so
badly
perhaps
he
got
a
very
beautiful
sister
married
to
a
man
in
the
rifles
jack
reeve
a
son
of
lord
reevely
a
selfish
sort
of
chap
i
do
suppose
he
gets
on
very
well
with
his
poor
dodor
his
sister
about
the
only
living
thing
he
cares
for
except
zouzou
i
wonder
if
the
bland
and
genial
monsieur
théodore
notre
sieur
théodore
now
junior
partner
in
the
great
haberdashery
firm
of

on
the
boulevard
des
capucines
and
a
pillar
of
the
english
chapel
in
the
rue
marbœuf
is
very
hard
on
his
employés
and
employées
if
they
are
a
little
late
at
their
counters
on
a
monday
morning
i
wonder
if
that
stingy
stodgy
pompous
old
prig
martinet
and
philistine
monsieur
le
de
la
ever
tells
madame
la
hunks
of
chicago
how
once
upon
a
time
dodor
and
he
we
will
tell
no
tales
out
of
school
the
present
scribe
is
no
snob
he
is
a
respectably
old
briton
of
the
higher
at
least
he
flatters
himself
so
and
he
writes
for
just
such
old
philistines
as
himself
who
date
from
a
time
when
titles
were
not
thought
so
cheap
as
alas
all
reverence
for
all
that
is
high
and
and
beautiful
seems
at
a
discount
so
he
has
kept
his
blackguard
ducal
zouave
for
the
bouquet
of
this
little
show
the
final
in
his
bohemian
that
he
may
make
it
palatable
to
those
who
only
look
upon
the
good
old
quartier
latin
now
no
more
to
speak
of
as
a
very
low
common
vulgar
quarter
indeed
deservedly
swept
away
where
misters
the
students
shocking
bounders
and
cads
had
nothing
better
to
do
day
and
night
than
mount
up
to
a
horrid
place
called
the
thatched
house

christmas
was
drawing
near
there
were
days
when
the
whole
quartier
latin
would
veil
its
iniquities
under
fogs
almost
worthy
of
the
thames
valley
between
london
bridge
and
westminster
and
out
of
the
studio
window
the
prospect
was
a
dreary
blank
no

to

fingers
could
hold
a
brush
or
squeeze
a
bladder
one
had
to
box
or
fence
at
nine
in
the
morning
that
one
might
recover
from
the
cold
bath
and
get
warm
for
the
rest
of
the
day
taffy
and
the
laird
grew
pensive
and
dreamy
childlike
and
bland
and
when
they
talked
it
was
generally
about
christmas
at
home
in
merry
england
and
the
distant
land
of
cakes
and
how
good
it
was
to
be
there
at
such
a
time
hunting
shooting
curling
and
endless
carouse
it
was
ho
for
the
jolly
west
riding
and
hey
for
the
bonnets
of
bonnie
dundee
till
they
grew
quite
homesick
and
wanted
to
start
by
the
very
next
train
they
did
do
anything
so
foolish
they
wrote
over
to
friends
in
london
for
the
biggest
turkey
the
biggest
that
could
be
got
for
love
or
money
with
and
holly
and
mistletoe
and
sturdy
short
thick
english
sausages
half
a
stilton
cheese
and
a
sirloin
of
beef
two
sirloins
in

one
should
not
be
enough

they

there
was

dined
at

père

as
usual
and
played
billiards
and
dominos
at
the
café
du

and
possessed
their
souls
in
patience
till
it
was
time
to
go
and
hear
the
midnight
mass
at
the
madeleine
where
roucouly
the
great
barytone
of
the
opéra
comique
was
retained
to
sing
adam
famous
noël
the
whole
quartier
seemed
alive
with
the
réveillon
it
was
a
clear
frosty
night
with
a
splendid
moon
just
past
the
full
and
most
exhilarating
was
the
walk
along
the
quays
on
the
rive
gauche
over
the
pont
de
la
concorde
and
across
the
place
thereof
and
up
the
thronged
rue
de
la
madeleine
to
the
massive
parthenaic
place
of
worship
that
always
has
such
a
pagan
worldly
look
of
smug
and
prosperous
modernity
they
struggled
manfully
and
found
standing
and
kneeling
room
among
that
fervent
crowd
and
heard
the
impressive
service
with
mixed
feelings
as
became
true
britons
of
very
advanced
liberal
and
religious
opinions
not
with
the
unmixed
contempt
of
the
proper
british
orthodox
who
were
there
in
full
force
one
may
be
sure
but
their
susceptible
hearts
soon
melted
at
the
beautiful
music
and
in
mere
sensuous
they
were
quickly
in
unison
with
all
the
rest
for
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
out
pealed
the
organ
and
up
rose
the
finest
voice
in
france

and
a
wave
of
religious
emotion
rolled
over
little
billee
and
submerged
him
swept
him
off
his
little
legs
swept
him
out
of
his
little
self
drowned
him
in
a
great
seething
surge
of
love
love
of
his
kind
love
of
love
love
of
life
love
of
death
love
of
all
that
is
and
ever
was
and
ever
will
be
a
very
large
order
indeed
even
for

and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
stretched
out
his
arms
for
love
to
one
figure
especially
beloved
beyond
all
the
rest
one
figure
erect
on
high
with
arms
outstretched
to
him
in
more
than
common
fellowship
of
need
not
the
sorrowful
figure
crowned
with
thorns
for
it
was
in
the
likeness
of
a
woman
but
never
that
of
the
virgin

of

it
was

trilby
trilby
a
poor
fallen
sinner
and
waif

but
lost
amid
the
scum
of
the
most
corrupt
city
on

trilby
weak
and
mortal
like
himself
and
in
woful
want
of

and
in

gray
dovelike
eyes
he
saw
the
shining
of
so
great
a
love
that
he
was
abashed
for
well
he
knew
that
all
that
love
was
his
and
would
be
his

so
sang
and
rang
and
pealed
and
echoed
the
big
deep
metallic
barytone
bass
above
the
organ
above
the
incense
above
everything
else
in
the
world
till
the
very
universe
seemed
to
shake
with
the
rolling
thunder
of
that
great
message
of
love
and
forgiveness
thus
at
least
felt
little
billee
whose
way
it
was
to
magnify
and
exaggerate
all
things
under
the
subtle
stimulus
of
sound
and
the
singing
human
voice
had
especially
strange
power
to
penetrate
into
his
inmost
depths
even
the
voice
of
man
and
what
voice
but
the
deepest
and
gravest
and
grandest
there
is
can
give
worthy
utterance
to
such
a
message
as
that
the
epitome
the
abstract
the
very
essence
of
all
collective
humanity
wisdom
at
its
best
little
billee
reached
the
hôtel
corneille
that
night
in
a
very
exalted
frame
of
mind
indeed
the
loftiest
lowliest
mood
of
all
now
see
what
sport
we
are
of
trivial
base
ignoble
earthly
things
sitting
on
the
and
smoking
two
cigars
at
once
he
found
ribot
one
of
his
whose
room
was
just
under
his
own
ribot
was
so
tipsy
that
he
could
not
ring
but
he
could
still
sing
and
did
so
at
the
top
of
his
voice
it
was
not
the
noël
of
adam
that
he
sang
he
had
not
spent
his
réveillon
in
any
church
with
the
help
of
a
sleepy
waiter
little
billee
got
the
bacchanalian
into
his
room
and
lit
his
candle
for
him
and
disengaging
himself
from
his
maudlin
embraces
left
him
to
wallow
in
solitude
as
he
lay
awake
in
his
bed
trying
to
recall
the
deep
and
high
emotions
of
the
evening
he
heard
the
tipsy
hog
below
tumbling
about
his
room
and
still
trying
to
sing
his
senseless
ditty

dont
mon

then
the
song
ceased
for
a
while
and
soon
there
were
other
sounds
as
on
a
channel
steamer
glougloux
indeed
then
the
fear
arose
in
little
billee
mind
lest
the
drunken
beast
should
set
fire
to
his
bedroom
curtains
all
heavenly
visions
were
chased
away
for
the
night
our
hero
with
fear
disgust
and
irritation
lay
wide
awake
his
nostrils
on
the
watch
for
the
smell
of
burning
chintz
or
muslin
and
wondered
how
an
educated
man
for
ribot
was
a
could
ever
make
such
a
filthy
beast
of
himself
as
that
it
was
a
scandal
a
disgrace
it
was
not
to
be
borne
there
should
be
no
forgiveness
for
such
as
ribot
not
even
on
christmas
day
he
would
complain
to
madame
paul
the
patronne
he
would
have
ribot
turned
out
into
the
street
he
would
leave
the
hotel
himself
the
very
next
morning
at
last
he
fell
asleep
thinking
of
all
he
would
do
and
thus
ridiculously
and
ignominiously
for
little
billee
ended
the
réveillon
next
morning
he
complained
to
madame
paul
and
though
he
did
not
give
her
warning
nor
even
insist
on
the
expulsion
of
ribot
who
as
he
heard
with
a
hard
heart
was
bien
malade
ce
matin
he
expressed
himself
very
severely
on
the
conduct
of
that
gentleman
and
on
the
dangers
from
fire
that
might
arise
from
a
tipsy
man
being
trusted
alone
in
a
small
bedroom
with
chintz
curtains
and
a
lighted
candle
if
it
had
been
for
himself
he
told
her
ribot
would
have
slept
on
the
and
serve
him
right
he
was
really
grand
in
his
virtuous
indignation
in
spite
of
his
imperfect
french
and
madame
paul
was
deeply
contrite
for
her
peccant
lodger
and
profuse
in
her
apologies
and
little
billee
began
his
christmas
day
like
a
pharisee
thanking
his
star
that
he
was
not

their

turned
up
and
ready
to
begin
at
twelve
the
trois
angliches
and
the
two
fair
blanchisseuses
sat
down
to
lunch
in
a
very
anxious
frame
of
mind
and
finished
a
pâté
de
foie
gras
and
two
bottles
of
burgundy
between
them
such
was
their
disquietude
the
guests
had
been
invited
for
six
most
elaborately
they
laid
the
cloth
on
the
table
they
had
borrowed
from
the
hôtel
de
seine
and
settled
who
was
to
sit
next
to
whom
and
then
unsettled
it
and
quarrelled
over
it
trilby
as
was
her
wont
in
such
matters
assuming
an
authority
that
did
not
rightly
belong
to
her
and
of
course
getting
her
own
way
in
the
end
and
that
as
the
laird
remarked
was
her
confounded
trilbyness
two

but
no
hamper
darkness
had
almost
set
in
it
was
simply
maddening
they
knelt
on
the
divan
with
their
elbows
on
the
and
watched
the
street
lamps
popping
into
life
along
the
quays
and
looked
out
through
the
gathering
dusk
for
the
van
from
the
chemin
de
fer
du
nord
and
gloomily
thought
of
the
morgue
which
they
could
still
make
out
across
the
river
illustration
souvenir
at
length
the
laird
and
trilby
went
off
in
a
cab
to
the
station
a
long
drive
and
lo
before
they
came
back
the
hamper
arrived
at
six
and
with
it
durien
vincent
antony
lorrimer
carnegie
petrolicoconose
dodor
and
the
last
two
in
uniform
as
usual
and
suddenly
the
studio
which
had
been
so
silent
dark
and
dull
with
taffy
and
little
billee
sitting
hopeless
and
despondent
round
the
stove
became
a
scene
of
the
noisiest
busiest
and
cheerfulest
animation
the
three
big
lamps
were
lit
and
all
the
chinese
lanterns
the
pieces
of
resistance
and
the
pudding
were
whisked
off
by
trilby
angèle
and
madame
vinard
to
other
regions
the
porter
lodge
and
durien
studio
which
had
been
lent
for
the
purpose
and
every
one
was
pressed
into
the
preparations
for
the
banquet
there
was
plenty
for
idle
hands
to
do
sausages
to
be
fried
for
the
turkey
stuffing
made
and
sauces
salads
mixed
and
punch
holly
hung
in
festoons
all
round
and
about
a
thousand
things
everybody
was
so
clever
and
that
nobody
got
in
anybody
way
not
even
carnegie
who
was
in
evening
dress
to
the
laird
delight
so
they
made
him
do
the
work
cleaning
rinsing
peeling
etc
the
cooking
of
the
dinner
was
almost
better
fun
than
the
eating
of
it
and
though
there
were
so
many
cooks
not
even
the
broth
was
spoiled
cockaleekie
from
a
receipt
of
the
laird
it
was
ten
before
they
sat
down
to
that
most
memorable
repast
zouzou
and
dodor
who
had
been
the
most
useful
and
energetic
of
all
its
cooks
apparently
quite
forgot
they
were
due
at
their
respective
barracks
at
that
very
moment
they
had
only
been
able
to
obtain
la
permission
de
dix
heures
if
they
remembered
it
the
certainty
that
next
day
zouzou
would
be
reduced
to
the
ranks
for
the
fifth
time
and
dodor
confined
to
his
barracks
for
a
month
did
not
trouble
them
in
the
least
the
waiting
was
as
good
as
the
cooking
the
handsome
quick
authoritative
madame
vinard
was
in
a
dozen
places
at
once
and
openly
prompted
rebuked
and
ballyragged
her
husband
into
a
proper
smartness
the
pretty
little
madame
angèle
moved
about
as
deftly
and
as
quietly
as
a
mouse
which
of
course
did
not
prevent
them
both
from
genially
joining
in
the
general
conversation
whenever
it
wandered
into
french
trilby
tall
graceful
and
stately
and
also
swift
of
action
though
more
like
juno
or
diana
than
hebe
devoted
herself
more
especially
to
her
own
particular
favorites
durien
taffy
the
laird
little
billee
and
dodor
and
zouzou
whom
she
loved
and
tutoyé
en

camarade
as
she
served
them
with
all
there
was
of
the
choicest
the
two
little
vinards
did
their
little
best
they
scrupulously
respected
the
and
only
broke
two
bottles
of
oil
and
one
of
harvey
sauce
which
made
their
mother
furious
to
console
them
the
laird
took
one
of
them
on
each
knee
and
gave
them
of
his
share
of
and
many
other
unaccustomed
good
things
so
bad
for
their
little
french
tumtums
the
genteel
carnegie
had
never
been
at
such
a
queer
scene
in
his
life
it
opened
his
mind
and
dodor
and
zouzou
between
whom
he
sat
the
laird
thought
it
would
do
him
good
to
sit
between
a
private
soldier
and
a
humble
corporal
taught
him
more
french
than
he
had
learned
during
the
three
months
he
had
spent
in
paris
it
was
a
specialty
of
theirs
it
was
more
colloquial
than
what
is
generally
used
in
diplomatic
circles
and
stuck
longer
in
the
memory
but
it
has
interfered
with
his
preferment
in
the
church
he
quite
unbent
he
was
the
first
to
volunteer
a
song
without
being
asked
when
the
pipes
and
cigars
were
lit
and
after
the
usual
toasts
had
been
drunk
her
majesty
health
tennyson
thackeray
and
dickens
and
john
leech
he
sang
with
a
very
cracked
and
rather
hiccupy
voice
his
only
song
it
seems
an
english
one
of
which
the
burden
he
explained
was
french
veeverler
veeverler

and
zouzou
and
dodor
complimented
him
so
profusely
on
his
french
accent
that
he
was
with
difficulty
prevented
from
singing
it
all
over
again
then
everybody
sang
in
rotation
the
laird
with
a
capital
barytone

antony

inspired
no
doubt
by
the
occasion
sang

and
accompanied

on
the
piano
but
failed
to
obtain
an
encore
durien
sang

chagrin

it
was
his
favorite
song
and
one
of
the
beautiful
songs
of
the
world
and
he
sang
it
very
well
and
it
became
popular
in
the
quartier
latin
ever
after
the
greek
could
sing
and
very
wisely
did
zouzou
sang
capitally
a
capital
song
in
praise
of
le
vin

quat
sous
taffy
in
a
voice
like
a
high
wind
and
with
a
very
good
imitation
of
the
yorkshire
brogue
sang
a
somersetshire
ending
of
this
song
should
i
be
axed
the
reason
for
to
show
i
do
exactly
know
i
do
exactly
know
but
all
my
fancy
dwells
upon
nancy
and
i
sing
it
is
a
quite
superexcellent
ditty
and
haunts
my
memory
to
this
day
and
one
felt
sure
that
nancy
was
a
dear
and
a
sweet
wherever
she
lived
and
when
so
taffy
was
encored
twice
once
for
her
sake
once
for
his
own
illustration
my
sister
dear
and
finally
to
the
surprise
of
all
the
bold
dragoon
sang
in
english
my
sister
dear
out
of
with
such
pathos
and
in
a
voice
so
sweet
and
high
and
well
in
tune
that
his
audience
felt
almost
weepy
in
the
midst
of
their
jollification
and
grew
quite
sentimental
as
englishmen
abroad
are
apt
to
do
when
they
are
rather
tipsy
and
hear
pretty
music
and
think
of
their
dear
sisters
across
the
sea
or
their
friends
dear
sisters
madame
vinard
interrupted
her
christmas
dinner
on
the
to
listen
and
wept
and
wiped
her
eyes
quite
openly
and
remarked
to
madame
boisse
who
stood
modestly
close
by
il
est
gentil
tout
plein

dieu
comme
il
chante

lui

and
madame
boisse
agreed
then
svengali
and
gecko
came
and
the
table
had
to
be
laid
and
decorated
anew
for
it
was
supper
was
even
jollier
than
dinner
which
had
taken
off
the
keen
edge
of
the
appetites
so
that
every
one
talked
at
once
the
true
test
of
a
successful
supper
except
when
antony
told
some
of
his
experiences
of
bohemia
for
instance
how
after
staying
at
home
all
day
for
a
month
to
avoid
his
creditors
he
became
reckless
one
sunday
morning
and
went
to
the
bains
deligny
and
jumped
into
a
deep
part
by
mistake
and
was
saved
from
a
watery
grave
by
a
bold
swimmer
who
turned
out
to
be
his
satory
to
whom
he
owed
sixty
francs
of
all
his
duns
the
one
he
dreaded
the
most
and
who
did
let
him
go
in
a
hurry
whereupon
svengali
remarked
that
he
also
owed
sixty
francs
to

whereupon
there
was
such
a
laugh
that
svengali
felt
he
had
scored
off
antony
at
last
and
had
a
prettier
wit
he
flattered
himself
that
got
the
laugh
of
antony
time
and
after
supper
svengali
and
gecko
made
such
lovely
music
that
everybody
was
sobered
and
athirst
again
and
the
wreathed
with
holly
and
mistletoe
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
table
and
clean
glasses
set
all
round
it
illustration
a
ducal
french
then
dodor
and
stood
up
to
dance
with
trilby
and
madame
angèle
and
executed
a
series
of
cancan
steps
which
though
they
were
so
inimitably
droll
that
they
had
each
and
all
to
be
encored
were
such
that
not
one
of
them
need
have
brought
the
blush
of
shame
to
the
cheek
of
modesty
then
the
laird
danced
a
over
two
t
squares
and
broke
them
both
and
taffy
baring
his
mighty
arms
to
the
admiring
gaze
of
all
did
exercises
with
little
billee
for
a
and
all
but
dropped
him
into
the
and
tried
to
cut
a
pewter
ladle
in
two
with
dodor
sabre
and
sent
it
through
the
window
and
this
made
him
cross
so
that
he
abused
french
sabres
and
said
they
were
made
of
worse
pewter
than
even
french
ladles
and
the
laird
sententiously
opined
that
they
managed
these
things
better
in
england
and
winked
at
little
billee
then
they
played
at
with
their
wrists
tied
across
their
shins
and
a
broomstick
thrust
in
between
thus
manacled
you
are
placed
opposite
your
antagonist
and
try
to
upset
him
with
your
feet
and
he
you
it
is
a
very
good
game
the
cuirassier
and
the
zouave
playing
at
this
got
so
angry
and
were
so
irresistibly
funny
a
sight
that
the
shouts
of
laughter
could
be
heard
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
so
that
a
sergent
de
ville
came
in
and
civilly
requested
them
not
to
make
so
much
noise
they
were
disturbing
the
whole
quartier
he
said
and
there
was
quite
a
rassemblement
outside
so
they
made
him
tipsy
and
also
another
policeman
who
came
to
look
after
his
comrade
and
yet
another
and
these
guardians
of
the
peace
of
paris
were
trussed
and
made
to
play
at
and
were
still
funnier
than
the
two
soldiers
and
laughed
louder
and
made
more
noise
than
any
one
else
so
that
madame
vinard
had
to
remonstrate
with
them
till
they
got
too
tipsy
to
speak
and
fell
fast
asleep
and
were
laid
next
to
each
other
behind
the
stove
the
de
reader
disgusted
at
the
thought
of
such
an
orgy
as
i
have
been
trying
to
describe
must
remember
that
it
happened
in
the
fifties
when
men
calling
themselves
gentlemen
and
being
called
so
still
wrenched
off
and
came
back
drunk
from
the
derby
and
even
drank
too
much
after
dinner
before
joining
the
ladies
as
is
all
duly
chronicled
and
set
down
in
john
leech
immortal
pictures
of
life
and
character
out
of
then
and
mme
vinard
and
trilby
and
angèle
boisse
bade
the
company
trilby
being
the
last
of
them
to
leave
little
billee
took
her
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
there
he
said
to
her
trilby
i
have
asked
you
nineteen
times
and
you
have
refused
trilby
once
more
on
christmas
night
for
the
twentieth
time
you
marry
me
if
not
i
leave
paris
morning
and
never
come
back
i
swear
it
on
my
word
of
honor
trilby
turned
very
pale
and
leaned
her
back
against
the
wall
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
little
billee
pulled
them
away
answer
me
trilby
god
forgive
me
said
trilby
and
she
ran
weeping
it
was
now
very
late
it
soon
became
evident
that
little
billee
was
in
extraordinary
high
spirits
in
an
abnormal
state
of
excitement
he
challenged
svengali
to
spar
and
made
his
nose
bleed
and
frightened
him
out
of
his
sardonic
wits
he
performed
wonderful
and
quite
unsuspected
feats
of
strength
he
swore
eternal
friendship
to
dodor
and
zouzou
and
filled
their
glasses
again
and
again
and
also
in
his
innocence
his
own
and
trinquéd
with
them
many
times
running
they
were
the
last
to
leave
except
the
three
helpless
policemen
and
at
about
five
or
six
in
the
morning
to
his
surprise
he
found
himself
walking
between
dodor
and
zouzou
by
a
late
windy
moonlight
in
the
rue
vieille
des
mauvais
ladres
now
on
one
side
of
the
frozen
gutter
now
on
the
other
now
in
the
middle
of
it
stopping
them
now
and
then
to
tell
them
how
jolly
they
were
and
how
dearly
he
loved
them
presently
his
hat
flew
away
and
went
rolling
and
skipping
and
bounding
up
the
narrow
street
and
they
discovered
that
as
soon
as
they
let
each
other
go
to
run
after
it
they
all
three
sat
down
so
dodor
and
little
billee
remained
sitting
with
their
arms
round
each
other
necks
and
their
feet
in
the
gutter
while
zouzou
went
after
the
hat
on
all
fours
and
caught
it
and
brought
it
back
in
his
mouth
like
a
tipsy
retriever
little
billee
wept
for
sheer
love
and
gratitude
and
called
him
a
in
english
and
laughed
loudly
at
his
own
wit
which
was
quite
thrown
away
on
zouzou
no
man
ever
such
dear
dear
frenge
no
man
ever
after
sitting
for
a
while
in
love
and
amity
they
managed
to
get
up
on
their
feet
again
each
helping
the
other
and
in
some
way
they
reached
the
hôtel
corneille
illustration
me
trilby
there
they
sat
little
billee
on
the
and
rang
the
bell
and
seeing
some
one
coming
up
the
place
de
and
fearing
he
might
be
a
sergent
de
ville
they
bid
little
billee
a
most
affectionate
but
hasty
farewell
kissing
him
on
both
cheeks
in
french
fashion
and
contriving
to
get
themselves
round
the
corner
and
out
of
sight
little
billee
tried
to
sing
zouzou
quoi
de
plus
doux
que
les
glougloux
les

vin
à

the
stranger
came
up
fortunately
it
was
no
sergent
de
ville
but
ribot
just
back
from
a
and
a
little
family
dance
at
his
aunt
madame
kolb
the
alsacian
banker
wife
in
the
rue
de
la
chaussée
illustration
a
next
morning
poor
little
billee
was
dreadfully
ill
he
had
passed
a
terrible
night
his
bed
had
heaved
like
the
ocean
with
oceanic
results
he
had
forgotten
to
put
out
his
candle
but
fortunately
ribot
had
blown
it
out
for
him
after
putting
him
to
bed
and
tucking
him
up
like
a
real
good
samaritan
and
next
morning
when
madame
paul
brought
him
a
cup
of
tisane
de
chiendent
which
does
not
happen
to
mean
a
hair
of
the
dog
that
bit
him
she
was
kind
but
very
severe
on
the
dangers
and
disgrace
of
intoxication
and
talked
to
him
like
a
mother
if
it
had
not
been
for
kind
monsieur
ribot
she
told
him
the
would
have
been
your
portion
and
who
could
say
you
deserve
it
and
then
think
of
the
dangers
of
fire
from
a
tipsy
man
all
alone
in
a
small
bedroom
with
chintz
curtains
and
a
lighted
candle
ribot
was
kind
enough
to
blow
out
my
candle
said
little
billee
humbly
ah
dame
said
madame
paul
with
much
meaning
au
moins
il
a
monsieur
ribot
and
the
crulest
sting
of
all
was
when
the
and
incorrigibly
festive
ribot
came
and
sat
by
his
bedside
and
was
kind
and
tenderly
sympathetic
and
got
him
a

the
chemist
unbeknown
to
madame

all
of
which
of
course
it
is
unnecessary
to
translate
except
perhaps
the
word
bosse
which
stands
for
noce
which
stands
for
a
jolly
good
spree
in
all
his
innocent
little
life
little
billee
had
never
dreamed
of
such
humiliation
as
this
such
ignominious
depths
of
shame
and
misery
and
remorse
he
did
not
care
to
live
he
had
but
one
longing
that
trilby
dear
trilby
kind
trilby
would
come
and
pillow
his
head
on
her
beautiful
white
english
bosom
and
lay
her
soft
cool
tender
hand
on
his
aching
brow
and
there
let
him
go
to
sleep
and
sleeping
die
he
slept
and
slept
with
no
better
rest
for
his
aching
brow
than
the
pillow
of
his
bed
in
the
hôtel
corneille
and
failed
to
die
this
time
and
when
after
some
hours
or
so
he
had
quite
slept
off
the
fumes
of
that
memorable
christmas
debauch
he
found
that
a
sad
thing
had
happened
to
him
and
a
strange
it
was
as
though
a
tarnishing
breath
had
swept
over
the
reminiscent
mirror
of
his
mind
and
left
a
little
film
behind
it
so
that
no
past
thing
he
wished
to
see
therein
was
reflected
with
quite
the
old
pristine
clearness
as
though
the
keen
quick
razorlike
edge
of
his
power
to
reach
and
the
charm
and
glamour
and
essence
of
things
had
been
blunted
and
coarsened
as
though
the
bloom
of
that
special
joy
the
gift
he
unconsciously
had
of
recalling
past
emotions
and
sensations
and
situations
and
making
them
actual
once
more
by
a
mere
effort
of
the
will
had
been
brushed
away
and
he
never
recovered
the
full
use
of
that
most
precious
faculty
the
boon
of
youth
and
happy
childhood
and
which
he
had
once
possessed
without
knowing
it
in
such
singular
and
exceptional
completeness
he
was
to
lose
other
precious
faculties
of
his
and
complex
nature
to
be
pruned
and
clipped
and
thinned
that
his
one
supreme
faculty
of
painting
might
have
to
reach
its
fullest
or
else
you
would
never
have
seen
the
wood

the
trees
or
which

on
day
taffy
and
the
laird
were
at
their
work
in
the
studio
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
monsieur
vinard
cap
in
hand
respectfully
introduced
a
pair
of
visitors
an
english
lady
and
gentleman
the
gentleman
was
a
clergyman
small
thin
with
a
long
neck
and
dryly
polite
the
lady
was
though
still
young
looking
very
pretty
with
gray
hair
very
well
dressed
very
small
full
of
nervous
energy
with
tiny
hands
and
feet
it
was
little
billee
mother
and
the
clergyman
the
rev
thomas
bagot
was
her
their
faces
were
full
of
trouble
so
much
so
that
the
two
painters
did
not
even
apologize
for
the
carelessness
of
their
attire
or
for
the
odor
of
tobacco
that
filled
the
room
little
billee
mother
recognized
the
two
painters
at
a
glance
from
the
sketches
and
descriptions
of
which
her
son
letters
were
always
full
they
all
sat
down
after
a
moment
embarrassed
silence
bagot
exclaimed
addressing
taffy
wynne
we
are
in
terrible
distress
of
mind
i
do
know
if
my
son
has
told
you
but
on
christmas
day
he
engaged
himself
to
be
married
to
be
exclaimed
taffy
and
the
laird
for
whom
this
was
news
indeed
yes
to
be
married
to
a
miss
trilby
who
from
what
he
implies
is
in
quite
a
different
position
in
life
to
himself
do
you
know
the
lady
mr
wynne
oh
yes
i
know
her
very
well
indeed
we
know
her
is
she
english
she
an
english
subject
i
believe
is
she
a
protestant
or
a
roman
catholic
inquired
the
clergyman
a
a
upon
my
word
i
really
do
know
you
know
her
very
well
indeed
and
you
mr
wynne
exclaimed
bagot
is
she
a
mr
wynne
asked
bagot
somewhat
impatiently
as
if
that
were
a
much
more
important
matter
by
this
time
the
laird
had
managed
to
basely
desert
his
friend
had
got
himself
into
his
bedroom
and
from
thence
by
another
door
into
the
street
and
away
a
lady
said
taffy
a
it
so
much
depends
upon
what
that
word
exactly
means
you
know
things
are
so
a
so
different
here
her
father
was
a
gentleman
i
believe
a
fellow
of
trinity
cambridge
and
a
clergyman
if
means
anything
he
was
unfortunate
and
all
that
a
intemperate
i
fear
and
not
successful
in
life
he
has
been
dead
six
or
seven
years
and
her
mother
i
really
know
very
little
about
her
mother
except
that
she
was
very
handsome
i
believe
and
of
inferior
social
rank
to
her
husband
also
dead
she
died
soon
after
him
what
is
the
young
lady
then
an
english
governess
or
something
of
that
sort
oh
no
no
a
nothing
of
sort
said
taffy
and
inwardly
you
coward
you
cad
of
a
scotch
thief
of
a
sneak
of
a
laird
to
leave
all
this
to
me
what
has
she
independent
means
of
her
own
then
a
not
that
i
know
of
i
should
even
say
decidedly
not
what
she
then
she
at
least
respectable
i
hope
at
present
she
a
a
blanchisseuse
de
fin
that
is
considered
respectable
here
why
that
a
is
it
well
rather
better
than
that
perhaps
you
know
things
are
so
different
in
paris
i
do
think
you
say
she
was
very
much
like
a
to
look
at
is
she
so
then
oh
yes
extremely
so
you
may
well
say
that
very
beautiful
indeed
about
that
at
least
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
and
of
unblemished
character
taffy
red
and
perspiring
as
if
he
were
going
through
his
exercise
was
silent
and
his
face
expressed
a
miserable
perplexity
but
nothing
could
equal
the
anxious
misery
of
those
two
maternal
eyes
so
wistfully
fixed
on
his
after
some
seconds
of
a
most
painful
stillness
the
lady
said
you
oh
you
give
me
an
answer
mr
wynne
oh
bagot
you
have
placed
me
in
a
terrible
position
i
i
love
your
son
just
as
if
he
were
my
own
brother
this
engagement
is
a
complete
surprise
to
me
a
most
painful
surprise
i
thought
of
many
possible
things
but
never
of
i
can
not
i
really
not
conceal
from
you
that
it
would
be
an
unfortunate
marriage
for
your
son
from
a
a
worldly
point
of
view
you
know
although
both
i
and
mcallister
have
a
very
deep
and
warm
regard
for
poor
trilby
indeed
a
great
admiration
and
affection
and
respect
she
was
once
a
model
a
wynne
what
of
a
model
there
are
models
and
models
of
course
illustration
she
a
mr
wynne
well
a
model
of
every
sort
in
every
possible
sense
of
the
word
head
hands
feet
everything
a
model
for
the
well
yes
oh
my
god
my
god
my
god
cried
bagot
and
she
got
up
and
walked
up
and
down
the
studio
in
a
most
terrible
state
of
agitation
her
following
her
and
begging
her
to
control
herself
her
exclamations
seemed
to
shock
him
and
she
did
seem
to
care
oh
wynne
wynne
if
you
only
what
my
son
is
to
me
to
all
of
us
always
has
been
he
has
been
with
us
all
his
life
till
he
came
to
this
wicked
accursed
city
my
poor
husband
would
never
hear
of
his
going
to
any
school
for
fear
of
all
the
harm
he
might
learn
there
my
son
was
as
innocent
and
as
any
girl
wynne
i
could
have
trusted
him
anywhere
and
that
why
i
gave
way
and
allowed
him
to
come
of
all
places
in
the
world
all
alone
oh
i
should
have
come
with
him
fool
fool
fool
that
i
was
oh
wynne
he
wo
see
either
his
mother
or
his
uncle

found
a
letter
from
him
at
the
hotel
saying
he
left
paris
and
i
do
even
know
where

ca
ca

to
avert
this
miserable
disaster

know
how
he
loves

should
see
his
letters
to
me
and
to
his
sister

are
always
full
of
you
indeed
bagot
you
can
count
on
mcallister
and
me
for
doing
everything
in
our
power
but
it
is
of
no
use
our
trying
to
influence
your
son
i
feel
quite
sure
of
it
is
to
we
must
make
our
appeal
oh
wynne
to
a
a
figure
model
and
heaven
knows
what
besides
and
with
such
a
chance
as
this
bagot
you
do
know
her
she
may
have
been
all
that
but
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
you
and
seems
to
me
for
that
matter
a
she
upon
my
word
of
honor
i
really
think
she
about
the
best
woman
i
ever
met
the
most
unselfish
the
most
ah
she
a
woman
i
can
well
see
she
has
a
beautiful
nature
bagot
you
may
believe
me
or
not
as
you
like
and
it
is
to
that
i
shall
make
my
appeal
as
your
friend
who
has
his
interests
at
heart
and
let
me
tell
you
that
deeply
as
i
grieve
for
you
in
your
present
distress
my
grief
and
concern
for
her
are
far
greater
what
grief
for
her
if
she
marries
my
son
no
indeed
but
if
she
refuses
to
marry
him
she
may
not
do
so
of
course
but
my
instinct
tells
me
she
will
oh
wynne
is
that
likely
i
will
do
my
best
to
make
it
so
with
such
an
utter
trust
in
her
unselfish
goodness
of
heart
and
her
passionate
affection
for
your
son
as
how
do
you
know
she
has
all
this
passionate
affection
for
him
oh
mcallister
and
i
have
long
guessed
it
though
we
never
thought
this
particular
thing
would
come
of
it
i
think
perhaps
that
first
of
all
you
ought
to
see
her
yourself
you
would
get
quite
a
new
idea
of
what
she
really
is
you
would
be
surprised
i
assure
you
bagot
shrugged
her
shoulders
impatiently
and
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
just
as
in
a
play
trilby
milk
below
was
sounded
at
the
door
and
trilby
came
into
the
little
antechamber
and
seeing
strangers
was
about
to
turn
back
she
was
dressed
as
a
grisette
in
her
sunday
gown
and
pretty
white
cap
for
it
was
day
and
looking
her
very
best
taffy
called
out
come
in
trilby
and
trilby
came
into
the
studio
as
soon
as
she
saw
bagot
face
she
stopped
short
erect
her
shoulders
a
little
high
her
mouth
a
little
open
her
eyes
wide
with
fright
and
pale
to
the
lips
a
pathetic
yet
commanding
magnificent
and
most
distinguished
apparition
in
spite
of
her
humble
attire
the
little
lady
got
up
and
walked
straight
to
her
and
looked
up
into
her
face
that
seemed
to
tower
so
trilby
breathed
hard
at
length
bagot
said
in
her
high
accents
you
are
miss
trilby
oh
yes
yes
i
am
trilby
and
you
are
bagot
i
can
see
that
a
new
tone
had
come
into
her
large
deep
soft
voice
so
tragic
so
touching
so
strangely
in
accord
with
the
whole
aspect
just
then
so
strangely
in
accord
with
the
whole
situation
that
taffy
felt
his
cheeks
and
lips
turn
cold
and
his
big
spine
thrill
and
tickle
all
down
his
back
oh
yes
you
are
very
very
beautiful
there
no
doubt
about
you
wish
to
marry
my
son
i
refused
to
marry
him
nineteen
times
for
his
own
sake
he
will
tell
you
so
himself
i
am
not
the
right
person
for
him
to
marry
i
know
that
on
christmas
night
he
asked
me
for
the
twentieth
time
he
swore
he
would
leave
paris
next
day
forever
if
i
refused
him
i
had
the
courage
i
was
weak
you
see
it
was
a
dreadful
mistake
are
you
so
fond
of
him
of
him
are
i
his
mother
my
good
girl
to
this
trilby
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
say
you
have
just
said
yourself
you
are
not
a
fit
wife
for
him
if
you
are
so
of
him
will
you
ruin
him
by
marrying
him
drag
him
down
prevent
him
from
getting
on
in
life
separate
him
from
his
sister
his
family
his
friends
illustration
of
him
are
trilby
turned
her
miserable
eyes
to
taffy
miserable
face
and
said
will
it
really
be
all
that
taffy
oh
trilby
things
have
got
all
wrong
and
ca
be
righted
i
afraid
it
might
be
so
dear
trilby
i
ca
tell
you
what
i
feel
but
i
tell
you
lies
you
know
oh
no
taffy
you
do
tell
lies
then
trilby
began
to
tremble
very
much
and
taffy
tried
to
make
her
sit
down
but
she
would
bagot
looked
up
into
her
face
herself
breathless
with
keen
suspense
and
cruel
anxiety
almost
imploring
trilby
looked
down
at
bagot
very
kindly
put
out
her
shaking
hand
and
said
bagot
i
will
not
marry
your
son
i
you
i
will
never
see
him
again
bagot
caught
and
clasped
her
hand
and
tried
to
kiss
it
and
said
do
go
yet
my
dear
good
girl
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
want
to
tell
you
how
deeply
i
bagot
said
trilby
once
more
and
disengaging
her
hand
she
walked
swiftly
out
of
the
room
bagot
seemed
stupefied
and
only
half
content
with
her
quick
triumph
she
will
not
marry
your
son
bagot
i
only
wish
to
god
she
marry
oh
mr
wynne
said
bagot
and
burst
into
tears
ah
exclaimed
the
clergyman
with
a
feebly
satirical
smile
and
a
little
cough
and
sniff
that
were
not
sympathetic
now
if
could
be
arranged
and
i
no
doubt
there
would
be
much
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
lady
here
he
made
a
little
complimentary
bow
it
would
be
a
very
desirable
thing
all
round
it
tremendously
good
of
you
i
sure
to
interest
yourself
in
humble
affairs
said
taffy
look
here
sir
i
not
a
great
genius
like
your
nephew
and
it
does
much
matter
to
any
one
but
myself
what
i
make
of
my
life
but
i
can
assure
you
that
if
trilby
heart
were
set
on
me
as
it
is
on
him
i
would
gladly
cast
in
my
lot
with
hers
for
life
she
one
in
a
thousand
she
the
one
sinner
that
repenteth
you
know
ah
yes
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
i
know
all
about
that
still
facts
are
facts
and
the
world
is
the
world
and
we
got
to
live
in
it
said
bagot
whose
satirical
smile
had
died
away
under
the
gleam
of
taffy
choleric
blue
eye
then
said
the
good
taffy
frowning
down
on
the
parson
who
looked
mean
and
foolish
as
people
can
sometimes
do
even
with
right
on
their
side
and
now
bagot
i
ca
tell
you
how
very
keenly
i
have
suffered
during
this
a
this
most
painful
interview
on
account
of
my
very
deep
regard
for
trilby
i
congratulate
you
and
your
on
its
complete
success
i
also
feel
very
deeply
for
your
nephew
not
sure
that
he
has
not
lost
more
than
he
will
gain
by
a
by
the
a
the
success
of
this
a
this
interview
in
short
taffy
eloquence
was
exhausted
and
his
quick
temper
was
getting
the
better
of
him
then
bagot
drying
her
eyes
came
and
took
his
hand
in
a
very
charming
and
simple
manner
and
said
wynne
i
think
i
know
what
you
are
feeling
just
now
you
must
try
and
make
some
allowance
for
us
you
will
i
am
sure
when
we
are
gone
and
you
have
had
time
to
think
a
little
as
for
that
noble
and
beautiful
girl
i
only
wish
that
she
were
such
that
my
son
marry
her
in
her
past
life
i
mean
it
is
not
her
humble
rank
that
would
frighten
me
believe
that
i
am
quite
sincere
in
this
and
do
think
too
hardly
of
your
friend
mother
think
of
all
i
shall
have
to
go
through
with
my
poor
son
who
is
deeply
in
love
and
no
wonder
and
who
has
won
the
love
of
such
a
woman
as
that
and
who
can
not
see
at
present
how
fatal
to
him
such
a
marriage
would
be
i
can
see
all
the
charm
and
believe
in
all
the
goodness
in
spite
of
all
and
oh
how
beautiful
she
is
and
what
a
voice
all
that
counts
for
so
much
does
it
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
grieve
for
her
i
can
make
no
amends
who
could
for
such
a
thing
there
are
no
amends
and
i
shall
not
even
try
i
will
only
write
and
tell
her
all
i
think
and
feel
you
will
forgive
us
wo
you
and
in
the
quick
impulsive
warmth
and
grace
and
sincerity
of
her
manner
as
she
said
all
this
bagot
was
so
absurdly
like
little
billee
that
it
touched
big
taffy
heart
and
he
would
have
forgiven
anything
and
there
was
nothing
to
forgive
oh
bagot
there
no
question
of
forgiveness
good
heavens
it
is
all
so
unfortunate
you
know
nobody
to
blame
that
i
can
see
bagot
sir
and
so
saying
he
saw
them
down
to
their
remise
in
which
sat
a
singularly
pretty
young
lady
of
seventeen
or
so
pale
and
anxious
and
so
like
little
billee
that
it
was
quite
funny
and
touched
big
taffy
heart
again
when
trilby
went
out
into
the
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
she
saw
miss
bagot
looking
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
in
the
young
lady
face
as
she
caught
her
eye
an
expression
of
sweet
surprise
and
sympathetic
admiration
with
lifted
eyebrows
and
parted
lips
just
such
a
look
as
she
had
often
got
from
little
billee
she
knew
her
for
his
sister
at
once
it
was
a
sharp
pang
illustration
so
like
little
billee
she
turned
away
saying
to
herself
oh
no
i
will
not
separate
him
from
his
sister
his
family
his
friends
that
would
do
settled
anyhow
feeling
a
little
dazed
and
wishing
to
think
she
turned
up
the
rue
vieille
des
mauvais
ladres
which
was
always
deserted
at
this
hour
it
was
empty
but
for
a
solitary
figure
sitting
on
a
post
with
its
legs
dangling
its
hands
in
its
an
inverted
pipe
in
its
mouth
a
tattered
straw
hat
on
the
back
of
its
head
and
a
long
gray
coat
down
to
its
heels
it
was
the
laird
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
he
jumped
off
his
post
and
came
to
her
saying
oh
trilby
what
it
all
about
i
could
stand
it
i
ran
away
little
billee
mother
there
yes
sandy
dear
i
just
seen
her
well
what
up
i
promised
her
never
to
see
little
billee
any
more
i
was
foolish
enough
to
promise
to
marry
him
i
refused
many
times
these
last
three
months
and
then
he
said
he
leave
paris
and
never
come
back
and
so
like
a
fool
i
gave
way
i
offered
to
live
with
him
and
take
care
of
him
and
be
his
servant
to
be
everything
he
wished
but
his
wife
but
he
would
hear
of
it
dear
dear
little
billee
he
an
angel
and
take
precious
good
care
no
harm
shall
ever
come
to
him
through
me
i
shall
leave
this
hateful
place
and
go
and
live
in
the
country
i
suppose
i
must
manage
to
get
through
life
somehow
i
know
of
some
poor
people
who
were
once
very
fond
of
me
and
i
could
live
with
them
and
help
them
and
keep
myself
the
difficulty
is
about
jeannot
i
thought
it
all
out
before
it
came
to
this
i
was
well
prepared
you
see
she
smiled
in
a
forlorn
sort
of
way
with
her
upper
lip
drawn
tight
against
her
teeth
as
if
some
one
were
pulling
her
back
by
the
lobes
of
her
ears
oh
but
trilby
what
shall
we
do
without
you
taffy
and
i
you
know
you
become
one
of
us
now
how
good
and
kind
of
you
to
say
that
exclaimed
poor
trilby
her
eyes
filling
why
that
just
all
i
lived
for
till
all
this
happened
but
it
ca
be
any
more
now
can
it
everything
is
changed
for
me
the
very
sky
seems
different
ah
durien
little
song
chagrin
it
all
quite
true
is
it
i
shall
start
immediately
and
take
jeannot
with
me
i
think
but
where
do
you
think
of
going
ah
i
may
tell
you
that
sandy
dear
not
for
a
long
time
think
of
all
the
trouble
there
be
well
there
no
time
to
be
lost
i
must
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
she
tried
to
laugh
and
took
him
by
his
big
and
kissed
him
on
the
eyes
and
mouth
and
her
tears
fell
on
his
face
then
feeling
unable
to
speak
she
nodded
farewell
and
walked
quickly
up
the
narrow
winding
street
when
she
came
to
the
first
bend
she
turned
round
and
waved
her
hand
and
kissed
it
two
or
three
times
and
then
disappeared
the
laird
stared
for
several
minutes
up
the
empty
thoroughfare
wretched
full
of
sorrow
and
compassion
then
he
filled
himself
another
pipe
and
lit
it
and
hitched
himself
on
to
another
post
and
sat
there
dangling
his
legs
and
kicking
his
heels
and
waited
for
the
bagots
cab
to
depart
that
he
might
go
up
and
face
the
righteous
wrath
of
taffy
like
a
man
and
bear
up
against
his
bitter
reproaches
for
cowardice
and
desertion
before
the
foe
next
morning
taffy
received
two
letters
one
a
very
long
one
was
from
bagot
he
read
it
twice
over
and
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
a
very
good
letter
the
letter
of
a
clever
woman
but
a
woman
also
whose
son
was
to
her
as
the
very
apple
of
her
eye
one
felt
she
was
ready
to
flay
her
dearest
friend
alive
in
order
to
make
little
billee
a
pair
of
gloves
out
of
the
skin
if
he
wanted
a
pair
but
one
also
felt
she
would
be
genuinely
sorry
for
the
friend
taffy
own
mother
had
been
a
little
like
that
and
he
missed
her
every
day
of
his
life
full
justice
was
done
by
bagot
to
all
trilby
qualities
of
head
and
heart
and
person
but
at
the
same
time
she
pointed
out
with
all
the
cunning
and
ingeniously
casuistic
logic
of
her
sex
when
it
takes
to
special
pleading
even
when
it
has
right
on
its
side
what
the
consequences
of
such
a
marriage
must
inevitably
be
in
a
few
years
even
sooner
the
quick
disenchantment
the
regret
on
both
sides
he
could
not
have
found
a
word
to
controvert
her
arguments
save
perhaps
in
his
own
private
belief
that
trilby
and
little
billee
were
both
exceptional
people
and
how
could
he
hope
to
know
little
billee
nature
better
than
the
boy
own
mother
and
if
he
had
been
the
boy
elder
brother
in
blood
as
he
already
was
in
art
and
affection
would
he
should
he
could
he
have
given
his
fraternal
sanction
to
such
a
match
both
as
his
friend
and
his
brother
he
felt
it
was
out
of
the
question
the
other
letter
was
from
trilby
in
her
bold
careless
handwriting
that
sprawled
all
over
the
page
and
her
occasionally
imperfect
spelling
it
ran
thus
illustration
must
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
my
dear
dear
taffy
this
is
to
say
i
going
away
to
put
an
end
to
all
this
misery
for
which
nobody
to
blame
but
myself
the
very
moment
after
i
said
to
little
billee
i
knew
perfectly
well
what
a
stupid
fool
i
was
and
i
been
ashamed
of
myself
ever
since
i
had
a
miserable
week
i
can
tell
you
i
knew
how
it
would
all
turn
out
i
am
dreadfully
unhappy
but
not
half
so
unhappy
as
if
i
married
him
and
he
were
ever
to
regret
it
and
be
ashamed
of
me
and
of
course
he
would
really
even
if
he
did
show
it
good
and
kind
as
he
is
an
angel
besides
of
course
i
could
never
be
a
lady
how
could
i
though
i
ought
to
have
been
one
i
suppose
but
everything
seems
to
have
gone
wrong
with
me
though
i
never
found
it
out
before
and
it
ca
be
righted
poor
papa
i
am
going
away
with
jeannot
i
been
neglecting
him
shamefully
i
mean
to
make
up
for
it
all
now
you
must
try
and
find
out
where
i
am
going
i
know
you
wo
if
i
beg
you
nor
any
one
else
it
would
make
everything
so
much
harder
for
me
angèle
knows
she
has
promised
me
not
to
tell
i
should
like
to
have
a
line
from
you
very
much
if
you
send
it
to
her
she
will
send
it
on
to
me
dear
taffy
next
to
little
billee
i
love
you
and
the
laird
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
whole
world
i
never
known
real
happiness
till
i
met
you
you
have
changed
me
into
another
person
you
and
sandy
and
little
billee
oh
it
been
a
jolly
time
though
it
did
last
long
it
will
have
to
do
for
me
for
life
so
i
shall
never
never
forget
and
remain
with
dearest
love
your
ever
faithful
and
most
affectionate
friend
trilby
when
it
has
all
blown
over
and
settled
again
if
it
ever
does
i
shall
come
back
to
paris
perhaps
and
see
you
again
some
day
the
good
taffy
pondered
deeply
over
this
letter
read
it
half
a
dozen
times
at
least
and
then
he
kissed
it
and
put
it
back
into
its
envelope
and
locked
it
up
he
knew
what
very
deep
anguish
underlay
this
somewhat
trivial
expression
of
her
sorrow
he
guessed
how
trilby
so
childishly
impulsive
and
demonstrative
in
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
friendship
would
be
more
reticent
than
most
women
in
such
a
case
as
this
he
wrote
to
her
warmly
affectionately
at
great
length
and
sent
the
letter
as
she
had
told
him
the
laird
also
wrote
a
long
letter
full
of
tenderly
worded
friendship
and
sincere
regard
both
expressed
their
hope
and
belief
that
they
would
soon
see
her
again
when
the
first
bitterness
of
her
grief
would
be
over
and
that
the
old
pleasant
relations
would
be
renewed
and
then
feeling
wretched
they
went
and
silently
lunched
together
at
the
café
de
where
the
omelets
were
good
and
the
wine
blue
late
that
evening
they
sat
together
in
the
studio
reading
they
found
they
could
not
talk
to
each
other
very
readily
without
little
billee
to
listen
three
company
sometimes
and
two
none
suddenly
there
was
a
tremendous
getting
up
the
dark
stairs
outside
in
a
violent
hurry
and
little
billee
burst
into
the
room
like
a
small
whirlwind
haggard
out
of
breath
almost
speechless
at
first
with
excitement
trilby
where
is
she
what
become
of
her
she
run
away
oh
she
written
me
such
a
letter
we
were
to
have
been
married
at
the
embassy
my
mother
she
been
meddling
and
that
cursed
old
ass
that
beast
my
uncle
they
been
here
i
know
all
about
it
why
did
you
stick
up
for
her
i
did
as
well
as
i
could
sandy
could
stand
it
and
cut
stuck
up
for
her
why
you
agreed
with
my
mother
that
she
ought
to
marry
me
you
you
false
friend
you
why
she
an
angel
far
too
good
for
the
likes
of
you
know
she
is
as
as
for
her
social
position
and
all
that
what
degrading
rot
her
father
was
as
much
a
gentleman
as
mine
besides
what
the
devil
do
i
care
for
her
father
it
i
want
i
tell
you
i
ca
without
her
i
must
have
her
i
must
have
her
do
you
we
were
to
have
lived
together
at
barbizon
all
our
lives
and
i
was
to
have
painted
stunning
pictures
like
those
other
fellows
there
who
cares
for
social
position
i
should
like
to
know
or
that
of
their
wives
social
position
we
often
said
so
over
and
over
again
an
artist
life
should
be
from
the
world
above
all
that
meanness
and
paltriness
all
in
his
work
social
position
indeed
over
and
over
again
said
what
fetid
bestial
rot
it
all
was
a
thing
to
make
one
sick
and
shut
one
self
away
from
the
world
why
say
one
thing
and
act
another
love
comes
before
all
love
levels
all
love
and
art
and
beauty
before
such
beauty
as
trilby
rank
does
exist
such
rank
as
mine
too
good
god
i
never
paint
another
stroke
till
i
got
her
back
never
never
i
tell
you
i
ca
i
wo
illustration
where
is
she
and
so
the
poor
boy
went
on
tearing
and
raving
about
in
his
rampage
knocking
over
chairs
and
easels
stammering
and
shrieking
mad
with
excitement
they
tried
to
reason
with
him
to
make
him
listen
to
point
out
that
it
was
not
her
social
position
alone
that
unfitted
her
to
be
his
wife
and
the
mother
of
his
children
etc
it
was
no
good
he
grew
more
and
more
uncontrollable
became
almost
unintelligible
he
stammered
so
a
pitiable
sight
and
pitiable
to
hear
oh
oh
good
heavens
are
you
so
precious
immaculate
you
two
that
you
should
throw
stones
at
poor
trilby
what
a
shame
what
a
hideous
shame
it
is
that
there
should
be
one
law
for
the
woman
and
another
for
the
man
poor
weak
women
poor
soft
affectionate
things
that
beasts
of
men
are
always
running
after
and
pestering
and
ruining
and
trampling
underfoot
oh
oh
it
makes
me
sick
it
makes
me
sick
and
finally
he
gasped
and
screamed
and
fell
down
in
a
fit
on
the
floor
the
doctor
was
sent
for
taffy
went
in
a
cab
to
the
hôtel
de
lille
et
to
fetch
his
mother
and
poor
little
billee
quite
unconscious
was
undressed
by
sandy
and
madame
vinard
and
put
into
the
laird
bed
the
doctor
came
and
not
long
after
bagot
and
her
daughter
it
was
a
serious
case
another
doctor
was
called
in
beds
were
got
and
made
up
in
the
studio
for
the
two
ladies
and
thus
closed
the
eve
of
what
was
to
have
been
poor
little
billee
it
seems
little
billee
attack
appears
to
have
been
a
kind
of
epileptic
seizure
it
ended
in
and
other
complications
a
long
and
tedious
illness
it
was
many
weeks
before
he
was
out
of
danger
and
his
convalescence
was
long
and
tedious
too
his
nature
seemed
changed
he
lay
languid
and
listless
never
even
mentioned
trilby
except
once
to
ask
if
she
had
come
back
and
if
any
one
knew
where
she
was
and
if
she
had
been
written
to
she
had
not
it
appears
bagot
had
thought
it
was
better
not
and
taffy
and
the
laird
agreed
with
her
that
no
good
could
come
of
writing
bagot
felt
bitterly
against
the
woman
who
had
been
the
cause
of
all
this
trouble
and
bitterly
against
herself
for
her
injustice
it
was
an
unhappy
time
for
everybody
there
was
more
unhappiness
still
to
come
one
day
in
february
madame
angèle
boisse
called
on
taffy
and
the
laird
in
the
temporary
studio
where
they
worked
she
was
in
terrible
tribulation
illustration
la
sœur
de
litrebili
trilby
little
brother
had
died
of
and
was
buried
and
trilby
had
left
her
the
day
after
the
funeral
and
had
never
come
back
and
this
was
a
week
ago
she
and
jeannot
had
been
living
at
a
village
called
vibraye
in
la
sarthe
lodging
with
some
poor
people
she
knew
she
washing
and
working
with
her
needle
till
her
brother
fell
she
had
never
left
his
bedside
for
a
moment
night
or
day
and
when
he
died
her
grief
was
so
terrible
that
people
thought
she
would
go
out
of
her
mind
and
the
day
after
he
was
buried
she
was
not
to
be
found
anywhere
she
had
disappeared
taking
nothing
with
her
not
even
her
clothes
simply
vanished
and
left
no
sign
no
message
of
any
kind
all
the
ponds
had
been
searched
all
the
wells
and
the
small
stream
that
flows
through
vibraye
and
the
old
forest
taffy
went
to
vibraye
everybody
he
could
communicated
with
the
paris
police
but
with
no
result
and
every
afternoon
with
a
beating
heart
he
went
to
the
morgue
the
news
was
of
course
kept
from
little
billee
there
was
no
difficulty
about
this
he
never
asked
a
question
hardly
ever
spoke
when
he
first
got
up
and
was
carried
into
the
studio
he
asked
for
his
picture
the
pitcher
goes
to
the
well
and
looked
at
it
for
a
while
and
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
laughed
a
miserable
sort
of
laugh
painful
to
hear
the
laugh
of
a
cold
old
man
who
laughs
so
as
not
to
cry
then
he
looked
at
his
mother
and
sister
and
saw
the
sad
havoc
that
grief
and
anxiety
had
wrought
in
them
it
seemed
to
him
as
in
a
bad
dream
that
he
had
been
mad
for
many
years
a
cause
of
endless
sickening
terror
and
distress
and
that
his
poor
weak
wandering
wits
had
come
back
at
last
bringing
in
their
train
cruel
remorse
and
the
remembrance
of
all
the
patient
love
and
kindness
that
had
been
lavished
on
him
for
many
years
his
sweet
sister
his
dear
mother
what
had
really
happened
to
make
them
look
like
this
and
taking
them
both
in
his
feeble
arms
he
fell
quite
desperately
and
for
a
long
time
and
when
his
was
over
when
he
had
quite
wept
himself
out
he
fell
asleep
illustration
he
fell
quite
desperately
and
when
he
awoke
he
was
conscious
that
another
sad
thing
had
happened
to
him
and
that
for
some
mysterious
cause
his
power
of
loving
had
not
come
back
with
his
wandering
wits
had
been
left
behind
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
gone
for
ever
and
ever
would
never
come
back
again
not
even
his
love
for
his
mother
and
sister
not
even
his
love
for
trilby
where
all
had
once
been
was
a
void
a
gap
a
blankness
truly
if
trilby
had
suffered
much
she
had
also
been
the
innocent
cause
of
terrible
suffering
poor
bagot
in
her
heart
could
not
forgive
her
i
feel
this
is
getting
to
be
quite
a
sad
story
and
that
it
is
high
time
to
cut
this
part
of
it
short
as
the
warmer
weather
came
and
little
billee
got
stronger
the
studio
became
more
pleasant
the
ladies
beds
were
removed
to
another
studio
on
the
next
landing
which
was
vacant
and
the
friends
came
to
see
little
billee
and
make
it
more
lively
for
him
and
his
sister
as
for
taffy
and
the
laird
they
had
already
long
been
to
bagot
as
a
pair
of
crutches
without
whose
invaluable
help
she
could
never
have
held
herself
upright
to
pick
her
way
in
all
this
maze
of
trouble
then
carrel
came
every
day
to
chat
with
his
favorite
pupil
and
gladden
bagot
heart
and
also
durien
carnegie
petrolicoconose
vincent
antony
lorrimer
dodor
and
bagot
thought
the
last
two
irresistible
when
she
had
once
been
satisfied
that
they
were
gentlemen
in
spite
of
appearances
and
indeed
they
showed
themselves
to
great
advantage
and
though
they
were
so
much
the
opposite
to
little
billee
in
everything
she
felt
almost
maternal
towards
them
and
gave
them
innocent
good
motherly
advice
which
they
swallowed
not
even
stealing
a
look
at
each
other
and
they
held
bagot
wool
and
listened
to
miss
bagot
sacred
music
with
upturned
pious
eyes
and
mealy
mouths
that
butter
would
melt
in
it
is
good
to
be
a
soldier
and
a
detrimental
you
touch
the
hearts
of
women
and
charm
them
old
and
young
high
or
low
excepting
perhaps
a
few
worldly
mothers
of
marriageable
daughters
they
take
the
sticking
of
your
tongue
in
the
cheek
for
the
wearing
of
your
heart
on
the
sleeve
indeed
good
women
all
over
the
world
and
ever
since
it
began
have
loved
to
be
bamboozled
by
these
genial
roistering
who
have
got
a
penny
to
bless
themselves
with
which
is
so
touching
and
are
supposed
to
carry
their
lives
in
their
hands
even
in
piping
times
of
peace
nay
even
a
few
rare
women
sometimes
such
women
as
the
best
and
wisest
of
us
are
often
ready
to
sell
our
souls
for
a
lightsome
eye
a
soldier

feather

the
blue
a
doublet

the
lincoln
green
no
more
of
me
you
knew
my
love
no
more
of
me
you
knew
as
if
that
was
enough
and
to
spare
little
billee
could
hardly
realize
that
these
two
polite
and
gentle
and
sympathetic
sons
of
mars
were
the
lively
grigs
who
had
made
themselves
so
pleasant
all
round
and
in
such
a
singular
manner
on
the
top
of
that
st
cloud
omnibus
and
he
admired
how
they
added
hypocrisy
to
their
other
crimes
svengali
had
gone
back
to
germany
it
seemed
with
his
pockets
full
of
napoleons
and
big
havana
cigars
and
wrapped
in
an
immense
coat
which
he
meant
to
wear
all
through
the
summer
but
little
gecko
often
came
with
his
violin
and
made
lovely
music
and
that
seemed
to
do
little
billee
more
good
than
anything
else
it
made
him
realize
in
his
brain
all
the
love
he
could
no
longer
feel
in
his
heart
the
sweet
melodic
phrase
rendered
by
a
master
was
as
wholesome
refreshing
balm
to
him
while
it
lasted
or
as
manna
in
the
wilderness
it
was
the
one
good
thing
within
his
reach
never
to
be
taken
from
him
as
long
as
his
remained
and
he
could
hear
a
master
play
poor
gecko
treated
the
two
english
ladies
bas
en
as
if
they
had
been
goddesses
even
when
they
accompanied
him
on
the
piano
he
begged
their
pardon
for
every
wrong
note
they
struck
and
adopted
their
tempi
that
is
the
proper
technical
term
i
believe
and
turned
scherzos
and
allegrettos
into
funeral
dirges
to
please
them
and
agreed
with
them
poor
little
traitor
that
it
all
sounded
much
better
like
that
o
beethoven
o
mozart
did
you
turn
in
your
graves
then
on
fine
afternoons
little
billee
was
taken
for
drives
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
with
his
mother
and
sister
in
an
open
fly
and
generally
taffy
as
a
fourth
to
passy

there
are
many
charming
places
within
an
easy
drive
of
paris
illustration
the
sweet
melodic
phrase
and
sometimes
taffy
or
the
laird
would
escort
and
miss
bagot
to
the
luxembourg
gallery
the
louvre
the
palais
royal
to
the
comédie
française
once
or
twice
and
on
sundays
now
and
then
to
the
english
chapel
in
the
rue
marbœuf
it
was
all
very
pleasant
and
miss
bagot
looks
back
on
the
days
of
her
brother
convalescence
as
among
the
happiest
in
her
life
and
they
would
all
five
dine
together
in
the
studio
with
madame
vinard
to
wait
and
her
mother
a
cordon
bleu
for
cook
and
the
whole
aspect
of
the
place
was
changed
and
made
fragrant
sweet
and
charming
by
all
this
new
feminine
invasion
and
occupation
and
what
is
sweeter
to
watch
than
the
dawn
and
growth
of
love
young

when
strength
and
beauty
meet
together
by
the
couch
of
a
beloved
invalid

course
the
sympathetic
reader
will
foresee
how
readily
the
stalwart
taffy
fell
a
victim
to
the
charms
of
his
friend
sweet
sister
and
how
she
grew
to
return
his
more
than
brotherly
regard
and
how
one
lovely
evening
just
as
march
was
going
out
like
a
lamb
to
make
room
for
the
first
of
april
little
billee
joined
their
hands
together
and
gave
them
his
brotherly
blessing
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
nothing
of
this
kind
happened
nothing
ever
happens
but
the
pazienza
then
at
length
one
day
it
was
a
fine
sunny
showery
day
in
april
and
the
big
studio
window
was
open
at
the
top
and
let
in
a
pleasant
breeze
from
the
northwest
just
as
when
our
little
story
began
a
railway
omnibus
drew
up
at
the
porte
cochère
in
the
place
anatole

carried
away

little
billee
and
his
mother
and
sister
and
all
their
belongings
the
famous
picture
had
gone
before
and
taffy
and
the
laird
rode
with
them
their
faces
very
long
to
see
the
last
of
the
dear
people
and
of
the
train
that
was
to
bear
them
away
from
paris
and
little
billee
with
his
quick
prehensile
æsthetic
eye
took
many
a
long
and
wistful
parting
gaze
at
many
a
french
thing
he
loved
from
the
gray
towers
of
notre
dame
downward
heaven
only
knew
when
he
might
see
them
again
so
he
tried
to
get
their
aspect
well
by
heart
that
he
might
have
the
better
store
of
beloved
shape
and
color
memories
to
chew
the
cud
of
when
his
lost
powers
of
loving
and
remembering
clearly
should
come
back
and
he
lay
awake
at
night
and
listened
to
the
wash
of
the
atlantic
along
the
beautiful
red
sandstone
coast
at
home
he
had
a
faint
hope
that
he
should
feel
sorry
at
parting
with
taffy
and
the
laird
but
when
the
time
came
for
saying
he
could
feel
sorry
in
the
least
for
all
he
tried
and
strained
so
hard
so
he
thanked
them
so
earnestly
and
profusely
for
all
their
kindness
and
patience
and
sympathy
as
did
also
his
mother
and
sister
that
their
hearts
were
too
full
to
speak
and
their
manner
was
quite
gruff
it
was
a
way
they
had
when
they
were
deeply
moved
and
did
want
to
show
it
and
as
he
gazed
out
of
the
carriage
window
at
their
two
forlorn
figures
looking
after
him
when
the
train
steamed
out
of
the
station
his
sorrow
at
not
feeling
sorry
made
him
look
so
haggard
and
so
that
they
could
scarcely
bear
the
sight
of
him
departing
without
them
and
almost
felt
as
if
they
must
follow
by
the
next
train
and
go
and
cheer
him
up
in
devonshire
and
themselves
too
they
did
not
yield
to
this
amiable
weakness
sorrowfully
arm
in
arm
with
trailing
umbrellas
they
recrossed
the
river
and
found
their
way
to
the
café
de
where
they
ate
many
omelets
in
silence
and
dejectedly
drank
of
the
best
they
could
get
and
were
very
sad
indeed
nearly
five
years
have
elapsed
since
we
bade
farewell
and
to
taffy
and
the
laird
at
the
paris
station
of
the
chemin
de
fer
du
nord
and
wished
little
billee
and
his
mother
and
sister
godspeed
on
their
way
to
devonshire
where
the
poor
sufferer
was
to
rest
and
lie
fallow
for
a
few
months
and
recruit
his
lost
strength
and
energy
that
he
might
follow
up
his
first
and
success
which
perhaps
contributed
just
a
little
to
his
recovery
many
of
my
readers
will
remember
his
splendid
début
at
the
royal
academy
in
trafalgar
square
with
that
now
so
famous
canvas
the
pitcher
goes
to
the
well
and
how
it
was
sold
three
times
over
on
the
morning
of
the
private
view
the
third
time
for
a
thousand
pounds
just
five
times
what
he
got
for
it
himself
and
that
was
thought
a
large
sum
in
those
days
for
a
beginner
picture
two
feet
by
four
illustration
sorrowfully
arm
in
arm
i
am
well
aware
that
such
a
vulgar
test
is
no
criterion
whatever
of
a
picture
real
merit
but
this
picture
is
well
known
to
all
the
world
by
this
time
and
sold
only
last
year
at
christy
more
than
years
after
it
was
painted
for
three
thousand
pounds
years
that
goes
a
long
way
to
redeem
even
three
thousand
pounds
of
all
their
cumulative
vulgarity
the
pitcher
is
now
in
the
national
gallery
with
that
other
canvas
by
the
same
hand
the
there
they
hang
together
for
all
who
care
to
see
them
his
first
and
his
last
the
blossom
and
the
fruit
he
had
not
long
to
live
himself
and
it
was
his
so
rare
among
those
whose
work
is
destined
to
live
forever
that
he
succeeded
at
his
first
and
his
success
was
of
the
best
and
most
flattering
kind
it
began
high
up
where
it
should
among
the
masters
of
his
own
craft
but
his
fame
filtered
quickly
down
to
those
immediately
beneath
and
through
these
to
wider
circles
and
there
was
quite
enough
of
opposition
and
vilification
and
coarse
abuse
of
him
to
clear
it
of
any
suspicion
of
cheapness
or
evanescence
what
better
antiseptic
can
there
be
than
the
philistine
deep
hate
what
sweeter
fresher
wholesomer
music
than
the
sound
of
his
voice
when
he
doth
so
furiously
rage
yes
that
is
good
production
as
svengali
would
have
said
un
cri
du
cœur
and
then
when
popular
acclaim
brings
the
great
dealers
and
the
big
cheques
up
rises
the
printed
howl
of
the
duffer
the
disappointed
one
the
wounded
thing
with
an
angry
cry
the
prosperous
and
happy
bagman
that
have
been
who
has
given
up
all
for
art
and
finds
he
ca
paint
and
make
himself
a
name
after
all
and
never
will
so
falls
to
writing
about
those
who
can
and
what
writing
to
write
in
hissing
dispraise
of
our
more
successful
and
of
those
who
admire
him
that
is
not
a
clean
or
pretty
trade
it
seems
alas
an
easy
one
and
it
gives
pleasure
to
so
many
it
does
not
even
want
good
grammar
but
it
pays
well
enough
even
to
start
and
run
a
magazine
with
instead
of
scholarship
and
taste
and
talent
humor
sense
wit
and
wisdom
it
is
something
like
the
purveying
of
pornographic
pictures
some
of
us
look
at
them
and
laugh
and
even
buy
to
be
a
purchaser
is
bad
enough
but
to
be
the
purveyor
thereof
ugh
a
poor
devil
of
a
cracked
soprano
are
there
such
people
still
who
has
been
turned
out
of
the
pope
choir
because
he
ca
sing
in
tune
think
of
him
yelling
and
squeaking
his
treble
rage
at
santley
sims
reeves
lablache
poor
lost
beardless
nondescript
why
not
fly
to
other
climes
where
at
least
thou
hide
from
us
thy
woful
crack
and
keep
thy
miserable
secret
to
thyself
are
there
no
harems
still
left
in
stamboul
for
the
likes
of
thee
to
sweep
and
clean
no
women
beds
to
make
and
slops
to
empty
and
doors
and
windows
to
bar
and
tales
to
carry
and
the
confidence
and
favor
and
protection
to
win
even
is
a
better
trade
than
pandering
for
hire
to
the
basest
instinct
of
all
the
dirty
pleasure
we
feel
some
of
us
in
seeing
mud
and
dead
cats
and
rotten
eggs
flung
at
those
we
can
not
but
admire
and
secretly
envy
all
of
which
eloquence
means
that
little
billee
was
pitched
into
right
and
left
as
well
as
overpraised
and
it
all
rolled
off
him
like
water
off
a
duck
back
both
praise
and
blame
it
was
a
happy
summer
for
bagot
a
sweet
compensation
for
all
the
anguish
of
the
winter
that
had
gone
before
with
her
two
beloved
children
together
under
her
wing
and
all
the
world
for
her
ringing
with
the
praise
of
her
boy
the
apple
of
her
eye
so
providentially
rescued
from
the
very
jaws
of
death
and
from
other
dangers
almost
as
terrible
to
her
fiercely
jealous
maternal
heart
and
his
affection
for
her
to
grow
with
his
returning
health
but
alas
he
was
never
again
to
be
quite
the
same
innocent
expansive
lad
he
had
been
before
that
fatal
year
spent
in
paris
one
chapter
of
his
life
was
closed
never
to
be
reopened
never
to
be
spoken
of
again
by
him
to
her
by
her
to
him
she
could
neither
forgive
nor
forget
she
could
but
be
silent
otherwise
he
was
pleasant
and
sweet
to
live
with
and
everything
was
done
to
make
his
life
at
home
as
sweet
and
pleasant
as
a
loving
mother
could
as
could
a
most
charming
sister
and
others
sisters
who
were
charming
too
and
much
disposed
to
worship
at
the
shrine
of
this
young
celebrity
who
woke
up
one
morning
in
their
little
village
to
find
himself
famous
and
bore
his
blushing
honors
so
meekly
and
among
them
the
vicar
daughter
his
sister
friend
and
at
the
a
simple
pure
and
pious
maiden
of
gentle
birth
everything
he
once
thought
a
young
lady
should
be
and
her
name
it
was
alice
and
she
was
sweet
and
her
hair
was
brown
as
brown
and
if
he
no
longer
found
the
simple
country
pleasures
the
junketings
and
picnics
the
and
innocent
little
musical
evenings
quite
so
exciting
as
of
old
he
never
showed
it
indeed
there
was
much
that
he
did
not
show
and
that
his
mother
and
sister
tried
in
vain
to
guess
many
things
and
among
them
one
thing
that
constantly
preoccupied
and
distressed
him
the
numbness
of
his
affections
he
could
be
as
easily
demonstrative
to
his
mother
and
sister
as
though
nothing
had
ever
happened
to
him
from
the
mere
force
of
a
sweet
old
habit
even
more
so
out
of
sheer
gratitude
and
compunction
but
alas
he
felt
that
in
his
heart
he
could
no
longer
care
for
them
in
the
least
nor
for
taffy
nor
the
laird
nor
for
himself
not
even
for
trilby
of
whom
he
constantly
thought
but
without
emotion
and
of
whose
strange
disappearance
he
had
been
told
and
the
story
had
been
confirmed
in
all
its
details
by
angèle
boisse
to
whom
he
had
written
it
was
as
though
some
part
of
his
brain
where
his
affections
were
seated
had
been
paralyzed
while
all
the
rest
of
it
was
as
keen
and
as
active
as
ever
he
felt
like
some
poor
live
bird
or
beast
or
reptile
a
part
of
whose
cerebrum
or
cerebellum
or
whatever
it
is
had
been
dug
out
by
the
vivisector
for
experimental
purposes
and
the
strongest
emotional
feeling
he
seemed
capable
of
was
his
anxiety
and
alarm
about
this
curious
symptom
and
his
concern
as
to
whether
he
ought
to
mention
it
or
not
he
did
not
do
so
for
fear
of
causing
distress
hoping
that
it
would
pass
away
in
time
and
redoubled
his
caresses
to
his
mother
and
sister
and
clung
to
them
more
than
ever
and
became
more
considerate
of
others
in
manner
word
and
deed
than
he
had
ever
been
before
as
though
by
constantly
assuming
the
virtue
he
had
no
longer
he
would
gradually
coax
it
back
again
there
was
no
trouble
he
would
not
take
to
give
pleasure
to
the
humblest
also
his
vanity
about
himself
had
become
as
nothing
and
he
missed
it
almost
as
much
as
his
affection
yet
he
told
himself
over
and
over
again
that
he
was
a
great
artist
and
that
he
would
spare
no
pains
to
make
himself
a
greater
but
that
was
no
merit
of
his
own
also
that
peculiarity
was
no
reason
why
should
be
conceited
for
what
was
but
a
result
either
way
well
he
was
like
just
an
inevitable
result
of
circumstances
over
which
he
had
no
control
a
mere
product
or
sum
and
though
he
meant
to
make
himself
as
big
a
as
he
could
to
cultivate
his
peculiar
he
could
no
longer
feel
the
old
conceit
and
and
they
had
been
a
joy
and
it
was
hard
to
do
without
them
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
was
a
vague
disquieting
unhappiness
a
constant
fidget
and
it
seemed
to
him
and
much
to
his
distress
that
such
mild
unhappiness
would
be
the
greatest
he
could
ever
feel
henceforward
but
that
such
as
it
was
it
would
never
leave
him
and
that
his
moral
existence
would
be
for
evermore
one
long
gray
gloomy
blank
the
glimmer
of
twilight
never
glad
confident
morning
again
so
much
for
little
billee
convalescence
then
one
day
in
the
late
autumn
he
spread
his
wings
and
flew
away
to
london
which
was
very
ready
with
open
arms
to
welcome
william
bagot
the
already
famous
painter
little
billee
part
fifth
little
billee
then
the
mortal
coldness
of
the
soul
like
death
itself
comes
down
it
can
not
feel
for
others
woes
it
dare
not
dream
its
own
that
heavy
chill
has
frozen
the
fountain
of
our
tears
and
though
the
eye
may
sparkle
yet
is
where
the
ice
appears
though
wit
may
flash
from
fluent
lips
and
mirth
distract
the
breast
through
midnight
hours
that
yield
no
more
their
former
hope
of
rest
is
but
as
ivy
leaves
around
a
ruined
turret
wreathe
all
green
and
wildly
fresh
without
but
worn
and
gray
beneath
when
taffy
and
the
laird
went
back
to
the
studio
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
and
resumed
their
ordinary
life
there
it
was
with
a
sense
of
desolation
and
dull
bereavement
beyond
anything
they
could
have
imagined
and
this
did
not
seem
to
lessen
as
the
time
wore
on
they
realized
for
the
first
time
how
keen
and
penetrating
and
unintermittent
had
been
the
charm
of
those
two
central
figures
trilby
and
little
billee
and
how
hard
it
was
to
live
without
them
after
such
intimacy
as
had
been
theirs
oh
it
been
a
jolly
time
though
it
did
last
long
so
trilby
had
written
in
her
farewell
letter
to
taffy
and
these
words
were
true
for
taffy
and
the
laird
as
well
as
for
her
and
that
is
the
worst
of
those
dear
people
who
have
charm
they
are
so
terrible
to
do
without
when
once
you
have
got
accustomed
to
them
and
all
their
ways
and
when
besides
being
charming
they
are
simple
clever
affectionate
constant
and
sincere
like
trilby
and
little
billee
then
the
lamentable
hole
their
disappearance
makes
is
not
to
be
filled
up
and
when
they
are
full
of
genius
like
little
billee
and
like
trilby
funny
without
being
vulgar
for
so
she
always
seemed
to
the
laird
and
taffy
even
in
french
in
spite
of
her
gallic
audacities
of
thought
speech
and
gesture
all
seemed
to
have
suffered
change
the
very
boxing
and
fencing
were
gone
through
perfunctorily
for
mere
health
sake
and
a
thin
layer
of
adipose
deposit
began
to
soften
the
outlines
of
the
hills
and
dales
on
taffy
mighty
forearm
dodor
and
no
longer
came
so
often
now
that
the
charming
little
billee
and
his
charming
mother
and
still
more
charming
sister
had
gone
away
nor
carnegie
nor
antony
nor
lorrimer
nor
vincent
nor
the
greek
gecko
never
came
at
all
even
svengali
was
missed
little
as
he
had
been
liked
it
is
a
dismal
and
sulky
looking
piece
of
furniture
a
that
nobody
ever
plays
with
all
its
sound
and
its
souvenirs
locked
up
inside
a
kind
of
mausoleum
a
coffin
trestles
and
all
so
it
went
back
to
london
by
the
little
quickness
just
as
it
had
come
thus
taffy
and
the
laird
grew
quite
sad
and
mopy
and
lunched
at
the
café
de
every
day
till
the
goodness
of
the
omelets
palled
and
the
redness
of
the
wine
there
got
on
their
nerves
and
into
their
heads
and
faces
and
made
them
sleepy
till
and
then
waking
up
they
dressed
respectably
and
dined
expensively
like
gentlemen
in
the
palais
royal
or
the
passage
choiseul
or
the
passage
des
panoramas
for
three
francs
three
francs
fifty
even
five
francs
a
head
and
half
a
franc
to
the
waiter
and
went
to
the
theatre
almost
every
night
on
that
side
of
the
water
and
more
often
than
not
they
took
a
cab
home
each
smoking
a
panatella
which
costs
centimes
five
sous
then
they
feebly
drifted
into
quite
decent
society
like
lorrimer
and
carnegie
with
and
white
ties
on
and
their
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
down
the
back
of
the
head
and
brought
over
the
ears
in
a
bunch
at
each
side
as
was
the
english
fashion
in
those
days
and
subscribed
to
and
had
themselves
proposed
and
seconded
for
the
cercle
anglais
in
the
rue
touche
a
circle
of
british
philistines
of
the
very
deepest
dye
and
went
to
hear
divine
service
on
sunday
mornings
in
the
rue
marbœuf
indeed
by
the
end
of
the
summer
they
had
sunk
into
such
depths
of
demoralization
that
they
felt
they
must
really
have
a
change
and
decided
on
giving
up
the
studio
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
and
leaving
paris
for
good
and
going
to
settle
for
the
winter
in
düsseldorf
which
is
a
very
pleasant
place
for
english
painters
who
do
not
wish
to
overwork
themselves
as
the
laird
well
knew
having
spent
a
year
there
illustration
demoralization
it
ended
in
taffy
going
to
antwerp
for
the
kermesse
to
paint
the
flemish
drunkard
of
our
time
just
as
he
really
is
and
the
laird
going
to
spain
so
that
he
might
study
toreadors
from
the
life
i
may
as
well
state
here
that
the
laird
toreador
pictures
which
had
had
quite
a
vogue
in
scotland
as
long
as
he
had
been
content
to
paint
them
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
quite
ceased
to
please
or
sell
after
he
had
been
to
seville
and
madrid
so
he
took
to
painting
roman
cardinals
and
neapolitan
pifferari
from
the
depths
of
his
consciousness
and
was
so
successful
that
he
made
up
his
mind
he
would
never
spoil
his
market
by
going
to
italy
so
he
went
and
painted
his
cardinals
and
his
pifferari
in
algiers
and
taffy
joined
him
there
and
painted
algerian
jews
just
as
they
really
are
and
did
sell
them
and
then
they
spent
a
year
in
munich
and
then
a
year
in
düsseldorf
and
a
winter
in
cairo
and
so
on
and
all
this
time
taffy
who
took
everything
grand
especially
the
claims
and
obligations
of
friendship
corresponded
regularly
with
little
billee
who
wrote
him
long
and
amusing
letters
back
again
and
had
plenty
to
say
about
his
life
in
london
which
was
a
series
of
triumphs
artistic
and
social
and
you
would
have
thought
from
his
letters
modest
though
they
were
that
no
happier
young
man
or
more
elate
was
to
be
found
anywhere
in
the
world
it
was
a
good
time
in
england
just
then
for
young
artists
of
promise
a
time
of
evolution
revolution
change
and
development
of
the
founding
of
new
schools
and
the
crumbling
away
of
old
ones
a
keen
struggle
for
existence
a
surviving
of
the
fit
a
preparation
let
us
hope
for
the
ultimate
survival
of
the
fittest
and
among
the
many
glories
of
this
particular
period
two
names
stand
out
very
conspicuously
for
the
immediate
and
so
far
lasting
fame
their
bearers
achieved
and
the
wide
influence
they
exerted
and
continue
to
exert
still
the
world
will
not
easily
forget
frederic
walker
and
william
bagot
those
two
singularly
gifted
boys
whom
it
soon
became
the
fashion
to
bracket
together
to
compare
and
to
contrast
as
one
compares
and
contrasts
thackeray
and
dickens
carlyle
and
macaulay
tennyson
and
browning
a
futile
though
pleasant
practice
of
which
the
temptations
seem
irresistible
yet
why
compare
the
lily
and
the
rose
these
two
young
masters
had
the
genius
and
the
luck
to
be
the
progenitors
of
much
of
the
best
that
has
been
done
in
england
during
the
last
thirty
years
in
oils
in
in
black
and
white
they
were
both
essentially
english
and
of
their
own
time
both
absolutely
original
receiving
their
impressions
straight
from
nature
itself
uninfluenced
by
any
school
ancient
or
modern
they
founded
schools
instead
of
following
any
and
each
was
a
law
unto
himself
and
a
unto
many
others

fred
walker
both
were
equally
great

they
attempted

ineffable
charm
of
poetry
and
refinement
of
pathos
and
sympathy
and
delicate
humor
combined
an
incomparable
ease
and
grace
and
felicity
of
workmanship
belong
to
each
and
yet
in
their
work
are
they
not
as
wide
apart
as
the
poles
each
complete
in
himself
and
yet
a
complement
to
the
other
and
oddly
enough
they
were
both
singularly
alike
in
aspect
both
small
and
slight
though
beautifully
made
with
tiny
hands
and
feet
always
arrayed
as
the
lilies
of
the
field
for
all
they
toiled
and
spun
so
arduously
both
had
regularly
featured
faces
of
a
noble
cast
and
most
winning
character
both
had
the
best
and
simplest
manners
in
the
world
and
a
way
of
getting
themselves
much
and
quickly
and
permanently
liked
la
terre
leur
soit
légère
and
who
can
say
that
the
fame
of
one
is
greater
than
the
other
their
pinnacles
are
twin
i
venture
to
believe
of
just
an
equal
height
and
width
and
thickness
like
their
bodies
in
this
life
but
unlike
their
frail
bodies
in
one
respect
no
taller
pinnacles
are
to
be
seen
methinks
in
all
the
garden
of
the
deathless
dead
painters
of
our
time
and
none
more
built
to
last
but
it
is
not
with
the
art
of
little
billee
nor
with
his
fame
as
a
painter
that
we
are
chiefly
concerned
in
this
unpretending
little
tale
except
in
so
far
as
they
have
some
bearing
on
his
character
and
his
fate

the

on

was

of

and

nor
were
coronets
wanting
on

of
these
hospitable

had
quite
overcome
his

for

do

go

and
daughters
and
female
cousins
even
their
mothers
and
aunts
in
point
of
fact
and
in
spite
of
his
tender
years
he
was
in
some
danger
for
his
art
of
developing
into
that
type
adored
by
sympathetic
women
who
have
got
much
to
do
the
friend
the
tame
cat
the
platonic
lover
with
many
loves
the
squire

the
trusty

there
is
no

whatever
i
told
and
i
am
glad
one
man
loves
his
fiddle
or
alas
his
neighbor
sometimes
for
all
the
melodies
he
can
wake
from
it
it
is
but
a
selfish
love
another
who
is
no
fiddler
may
love
a
fiddle
too
for
its
symmetry
its
neatness
its
color
its
delicate
grainings
the
lovely
lines
and
curves
of
its
back
and
front
for
its
own
sake
so
to
speak
he
may
have
a
whole
galleryful
of
fiddles
to
love
in
this
innocent
way
a
harem
and
yet
not
know
a
single
note
of
music
or
even
care
to
hear
one
he
will
dust
them
and
stroke
them
and
take
them
down
and
try
to
put
them
in
tune
pizzicato
and
put
them
back
again
and
call
them
ever
such
sweet
little
pet
names
viol
viola
viola
viol
di
gamba
violino
mio
and
breathe
his
little
troubles
into
them
and
they
will
give
back
inaudible
little
murmurs
in
sympathetic
response
like
a
damp
æolian
harp
but
he
will
never
draw
a
bow
across
the
strings
nor
wake
a
single
chord
or
discord
and
who
shall
say
he
is
not
wise
in
his
generation
it
is
but
an
philistine
notion
that
fiddles
were
only
made
to
be
played
on
the
fiddles
themselves
are
beginning
to
resent
it
and
rightly
i
wot
in
this
harmless
fashion
little
billee
was
friends
with
more
than
one
fine
lady
par
le
indeed
he
had
been
reproached
by
his
more
bohemian
brothers
of
the
brush
for
being
something
of
a
most
unjustly
but
nothing
gives
such
keen
offence
to
our
unsuccessful
brother
bohemian
or
bourgeois
as
our
sudden
intimacy
with
the
great
the
little
lords
and
ladies
of
this
little
world
not
even
our
fame
and
success
and
all
the
joy
and
pride
they
bring
us
are
so
hard
to
condone
so
imbittering
so
humiliating
to
the
jealous
fraternal
heart
alas
poor
humanity
that
the
mere
countenance
of
our
betters
if
they
our
betters
should
be
thought
so
priceless
a
boon
so
consummate
an
achievement
so
crowning
a
glory
as
all
that
a
dirty
bit
of
the
stump
of
a
cigar
once
trod
on
by
a
princely
heel
how
beautiful
they
are
little
billee
was
no
he
was
the
or
had
been
no
one
of
his
kind
was
ever
more
persistently
resolutely
hospitably
harried
than
this
young
hare
with
many
friends
by
people
of
rank
and
fashion
and
at
first
he
thought
them
most
charming
as
they
so
often
are
these
graceful
gracious
gay
stoics
and
barbarians
whose
manners
are
as
easy
and
simple
as
their
morals
but
how
much
better
and
who
at
least
have
this
charm
that
they
can
wallow
in
untold
gold
when
they
happen
to
possess
it
without
ever
seeming
to
stink
of
the
same
yes
they
bear
wealth
gracefully
and
the
want
of
it
more
gracefully
still
and
these
are
pretty
accomplishments
that
have
yet
to
be
learned
by
our
new
aristocracy
of
the
shop
and
jew
or
gentile
which
is
everywhere
elbowing
its
irresistible
way
to
the
top
and
front
of
everything
both
here
and
abroad
then
he
discovered
that
much
as
you
might
be
with
them
you
could
never
be
them
unless
perchance
you
managed
to
hook
on
by
marrying
one
of
their
ugly
ducklings
their
failures
their
remnants
and
even
then
life
is
all
beer
and
skittles
for
a
rank
outsider
i
told
then
he
discovered
that
he
did
want
to
be
of
them
in
the
least
especially
at
such
a
cost
as
that
and
that
to
be
very
much
with
them
was
apt
to
pall
like
everything
else
also
he
found
that
they
were
very
mixed
good
bad
and
indifferent
and
not
always
very
dainty
or
select
in
their
predilections
since
they
took
unto
their
bosoms
such
queer
outsiders
just
for
the
sake
of
being
amused
a
little
while
that
their
capricious
favor
ceased
to
be
an
honor
and
a
glory
if
it
ever
was
and
then
their
fickleness
indeed
he
found
or
thought
he
found
that
they
could
be
just
as
clever
as
liberal
as
polite
or
refined
as
narrow
insolent
swaggering
coarse
and
vulgar
as
handsome
as
ugly
as
graceful
as
ungainly
as
modest
or
conceited
as
any
other
upper
class
of
the
community
and
indeed
some
lower
ones
beautiful
young
women
who
had
been
taught
how
to
paint
pretty
little
landscapes
with
an
ruin
in
the
middle
distance
talked
technically
of
painting
to
him
pair
à
as
though
they
were
quite
on
the
same
artistic
level
and
did
mind
admitting
it
in
spite
of
the
social
gulf
between
hideous
old
frumps
osseous
or
obese
yet
with
unduly
bared
neck
and
shoulders
that
made
him
sick
patronized
him
and
gave
him
good
advice
and
told
him
to
emulate
buckner
both
in
his
genius
and
his
manners
since
buckner
was
the
only
gentleman
who
ever
painted
for
hire
and
they
promised
him
in
time
an
equal
success
here
and
there
some
sweet
old
darling
specially
enslaved
him
by
her
kindness
grace
knowledge
of
life
and
tender
womanly
sympathy
like
the
dowager
lady
chiselhurst
or
some
sweet
young
one
like
the
lovely
duchess
of
towers
by
her
beauty
wit
and
sisterly
interest
in
all
he
did
and
who
in
some
vague
distant
manner
constantly
reminded
him
of
trilby
although
she
was
such
a
great
and
fashionable
lady
but
just
such
darlings
old
or
young
were
to
be
found
with
still
higher
ideals
in
less
exalted
spheres
and
were
easier
of
access
with
no
impassable
gulf
between
spheres
where
there
was
no
patronizing
nothing
but
deference
and
warm
appreciation
and
delicate
flattery
from
men
and
women
alike
and
where
the
aged
venuses
whose
prime
was
of
the
days
of
waterloo
went
with
their
historical
remains
duly
shrouded
like
ruins
and
in
the
middle
distance
illustration
darlings
old
or
young
so
he
actually
grew
tired
of
the
great
before
they
had
time
to
tire
of
him
incredible
as
it
may
seem
and
against
nature
and
this
saved
him
many
a
and
he
ceased
to
be
seen
at
fashionable
drums
or
gatherings
of
any
kind
except
in
one
or
two
houses
where
he
was
especially
liked
and
made
welcome
for
his
own
sake
such
as
lord
chiselhurst
in
piccadilly
where
the
found
a
home
for
a
few
years
before
going
to
its
last
home
and
final
in
the
national
gallery
or
baron
stoppenheim
in
cavendish
square
where
many
lovely
little

i
much
grieve
to
say
it
of
a
hero
of
romance
was
an
excellent
man
of
business
that
infinitesimal
dose
of
the
good
old
oriental
blood
kept
him
straight
and
not
only
made
him
stick
to
his
last
through
thick
and
thin
but
also
to
those
whose
foot
his
last
was
found
to
match
for
he
could
or
would
alter
his
last
he
loved
to
make
as
much
money
as
he
could
that
he
might
spend
it
royally
in
pretty
gifts
to
his
mother
and
sister
whom
it
was
his
pleasure
to
load
in
this
way
and
whose
circumstances
had
been
very
much
altered
by
his
quick
success
there
was
never
a
more
generous
son

brother
than
little
billee
of
the
clouded
heart
that
could
love
any
longer

soon
got
to

made
as
many

simulates
a
modest
surprise
and
finally
professes
his
willingness
like
barkis
then
clearing
his
throat
a
good
many
times
looks
up
to
the
ceiling
and
after
one
or
two
unsuccessful
starts
in
different
keys
bravely
sings
kathleen
mavourneen
let
us
say
perhaps
in
a
touchingly
sweet
tenor
voice
kathleen
mavourneen
the
gry
dawn
is
brykin
the
of
the
is
on
the
and
little
billee
did
mind
the
dropping
of
all
these
aitches
if
the
voice
was
sympathetic
and
well
in
tune
and
the
sentiment
simple
tender
and
sincere
or
else
with
a
good
rolling
jingo
bass
it
was
o
hoak
are
our
ships
o
hoak
are
our
men
and
we
fight
and
we
conkwer
agen
and
agen
and
no
imperfection
of
accent
in
little
billee
estimation
subtracted
one
jot
from
the
manly
british
pluck
that
found
expression
in
these
noble
sentiments
nor
added
one
tittle
to
their
swaggering
blatant
and
idiotically
aggressive
vulgarity
well
the
song
finishes
with
general
applause
all
round
then
the
chairman
says
your
and
song
sir
and
drinks
and
all
do
the
same
then
vice
asks
what
shall
we
the
pleasure
of
saying
sir
after
that
very
nice
illustration
the
chairman
and
the
blushing
vocalist
if
he
knows
the
ropes
replies
a
roast
leg
o
mutton
in
newgate
and
nobody
to
eat
it
or
else
may
as
is
going
up
the
o
prosperity
never
meet
a
friend
coming
down
or
else
to
as
shares
our
sorrers
and
doubles
our
joys
or
else
to
as
shares
our
joys
and
doubles
our
expenses
and
so
forth
more
drink
more
applause
and
many
and
vice
says
to
the
singer
you
call
sir
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
call
on
some
other
for
a
and
so
the
evening
goes
on
and
nobody
was
more
quickly
popular
at
such
gatherings
or
sang
better
songs
or
proposed
more
touching
sentiments
or
filled
either
chair
or
with
more
grace
and
dignity
than
little
billee
not
even
dodor
or
could
have
beaten
him
at
that
and
he
was
as
happy
as
genial
and
polite
as
much
at
his
ease
in
these
humble
gatherings
as
in
the
gilded
saloons
of
the
great
where
are
and
hired
accompanists
and
singers
and
a
good
deal
of
talk
while
they
sing
so
his
powers
of
quick
wide
universal
sympathy
grew
and
grew
and
made
up
to
him
a
little
for
his
lost
power
of
being
specially
fond
of
special
individuals
for
he
made
no
close
friends
among
men
and
ruthlessly
snubbed
all
attempts
at
intimacy
all
advances
towards
an
affection
which
he
felt
he
could
not
return
and
more
than
one
enthusiastic
admirer
of
his
talent
and
his
charm
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
with
all
his
gifts
he
seemed
heartless
and
capricious
as
ready
to
drop
you
as
he
had
been
to
take
you
up
he
loved
to
be
wherever
he
could
meet
his
kind
high
or
low
and
felt
as
happy
on
a
penny
steamer
as
on
the
yacht
of
a
millionaire
on
the
crowded
of
an
omnibus
as
on
the
of
a
drag
happier
he
liked
to
feel
the
warm
contact
of
his
at
either
shoulder
and
at
his
back
and
did
object
to
a
little
honest
grime
and
i
think
all
this
genial
caressing
love
of
his
kind
this
depth
and
breath
of
human
sympathy
are
patent
in
all
his
work
on
the
whole
however
he
came
to
prefer
for
society
that
of
the
best
and
cleverest
of
his
own
class
those
who
live
and
prevail
by
the
professional
exercise
of
their
own
specially
trained
and
highly
educated
wits
the
skilled
workmen
of
the
brain
from
the
lord
of
england
downward
the
salt
of
the
earth
in
his
opinion
and
stuck
to
them
there
is
no
class
so
genial
and
sympathetic
as
in
the
even
if
it
be
but
the
criminal
class
none
where
the
welcome
is
likely
to
be
so
genuine
and
sincere
so
easy
to
win
so
difficult
to
outstay
if
we
be
but
decently
pleasant
and
successful
none
where
the
memory
of
us
will
be
kept
so
green
if
we
leave
any
memory
at
all
so
little
billee
found
it
expedient
when
he
wanted
rest
and
play
to
seek
them
at
the
houses
of
those
whose
rest
and
play
were
like
his
own
little
halts
in
a
seeming
happy
full
of
toil
and
strain
and
endeavor
oases
of
sweet
water
and
cooling
shade
where
the
food
was
good
and
plentiful
though
the
tents
might
not
be
of
cloth
of
gold
where
the
talk
was
of
something
more
to
his
taste
than
court
or
sport
or
narrow
party
politics
the
new
beauty
the
coming
match
of
the
season
the
coming
ducal
conversion
to
rome
the
last
elopement
in
high
life
the
next
and
where
the
music
was
that
of
the
greatest
that
can
be
who
found
rest
and
play
in
making
better
music
for
love
than
they
ever
made
for
hire
and
were
listened
to
as
they
should
be
with
understanding
and
religious
silence
and
all
the
fervent
gratitude
they
deserved
there
were
several
such
houses
in
london
then
and
are
still
thank
heaven
and
little
billee
had
his
little
billet
there
and
there
he
was
wont
to
drown
himself
in
waves
of
lovely
sound
or
streams
of
clever
talk
or
rivers
of
sweet
feminine
adulation
seas
oceans
a
somewhat
relaxing
bath
and
forget
for
a
while
his
everlasting
chronic
plague
of
which
no
doctor
could
explain
or
cure
and
to
which
he
was
becoming
gradually
resigned
as
one
does
to
deafness
or
blindness
or
locomotor
ataxia
for
it
had
lasted
nearly
five
years
but
now
and
again
during
sleep
and
in
a
blissful
dream
the
lost
power
of
loving
of
loving
mother
sister
friend
would
be
restored
to
him
just
as
with
a
blind
man
who
sometimes
dreams
he
has
recovered
his
sight
and
the
joy
of
it
would
wake
him
to
the
sad
reality
till
he
got
to
know
even
in
his
dream
that
he
was
only
dreaming
after
all
whenever
that
priceless
boon
seemed
to
be
his
own
once
more
and
did
his
utmost
not
to
wake
and
these
were
nights
to
be
marked
with
a
white
stone
and
remembered
and
nowhere
was
he
happier
than
at
the
houses
of
the
great
surgeons
and
physicians
who
interested
themselves
in
his
strange
disease
when
the
little
billees
of
this
world
fall
ill
the
great
surgeons
and
physicians
like
the
great
singers
and
musicians
do
better
for
them
out
of
mere
love
and
kindness
than
for
the
princes
of
the
earth
who
pay
them
fees
and
load
them
with
honors
and
of
all
these
notable
london
houses
none
was
pleasanter
than
that
of
cornelys
the
great
sculptor
and
little
billee
was
such
a
favorite
in
that
house
that
he
was
able
to
take
his
friends
taffy
and
the
laird
there
the
very
day
they
came
to
london
first
of
all
they
dined
together
at
a
delightful
little
pothouse
near
leicester
square
where
they
had
bouillabaisse
imagine
the
laird
delight
and
spaghetti
and
a
poulet
rôti
which
is
a
different
affair
from
a
roast
fowl
and
salad
which
taffy
was
allowed
to
make
and
mix
himself
and
they
all
smoked
just
where
they
sat
the
moment
they
had
swallowed
their
food
as
had
been
their
way
in
the
good
old
paris
days
that
dinner
was
a
happy
one
for
taffy
and
the
laird
with
their
little
billee
apparently
unchanged
as
demonstrative
as
genial
and
caressing
as
ever
and
with
no
swagger
to
speak
of
and
with
so
many
things
to
talk
about
that
were
new
to
them
and
of
such
delightful
interest
they
also
had
much
to
say
but
they
did
say
very
much
about
paris
for
fear
of
waking
up
heaven
knows
what
sleeping
dogs
and
every
now
and
again
in
the
midst
of
all
this
pleasant
foregathering
and
communion
of
friends
the
pangs
of
little
miserable
would
shoot
through
him
like
poisoned
arrows
he
would
catch
himself
thinking
how
fat
and
fussy
and
serious
about
trifles
taffy
had
become
and
what
a
shiftless
feckless
futile
duffer
was
the
laird
and
how
greedy
they
both
were
and
how
red
and
coarse
their
ears
and
gills
and
cheeks
grew
as
they
fed
and
how
shiny
their
faces
and
how
little
he
would
care
try
as
he
might
if
they
both
fell
down
dead
under
the
table
and
this
would
make
him
behave
more
caressingly
to
them
more
genially
and
demonstratively
than
ever
for
he
knew
it
was
all
a
grewsome
physical
ailment
of
his
own
which
he
could
no
more
help
than
a
cataract
in
his
eye
then
catching
sight
of
his
own
face
and
form
in
a
mirror
he
would
curse
himself
for
a
puny
misbegotten
shrimp
an
imp
an
abortion
no
bigger
by
the
side
of
the
herculean
taffy
or
the
burly
laird
of
cockpen
than
o
a
wretched
little
overrated
follower
of
a
poor
trivial
craft
a
mere
light
amuser
for
what
did
pictures
matter
or
whether
they
were
good
or
bad
except
to
the
triflers
who
painted
them
the
dealers
who
sold
them
the
idle
uneducated
fools
who
bought
them
and
stuck
them
up
on
their
walls
because
they
were
told
and
he
felt
that
if
a
dynamite
shell
were
beneath
the
table
where
they
sat
and
its
fuse
were
smoking
under
their
very
noses
he
would
neither
wish
to
warn
his
friends
nor
move
himself
he
did
care
a
d
and
all
this
made
him
so
lively
and
brilliant
in
his
talk
so
fascinating
and
droll
and
witty
that
taffy
and
the
laird
wondered
at
the
improvement
success
and
the
experience
of
life
had
wrought
in
him
and
marvelled
at
the
happiness
of
his
lot
and
almost
found
it
in
their
warm
affectionate
hearts
to
feel
a
touch
of
envy
illustration
a
happy
dinner
oddly
enough
in
a
brief
flash
of
silence
entre
la
poire
et
le
fromage
they
heard
a
foreigner
at
an
adjoining
table
one
of
a
very
noisy
group
exclaim
mais
quand
je
vous
dis
que
entendue
moi
la
svengali
et
même
a
chanté
de
chopin
absolument
comme
si
un
piano
jouait
voyons
farceur
la
bonne
blague
said
another
and
then
the
conversation
became
so
noisily
general
it
was
no
good
listening
any
more
svengali
how
funny
that
name
should
turn
up
i
wonder
what
become
of
svengali
observed
taffy
i
remember
playing
chopin
impromptu
said
little
billee
what
a
singular
coincidence
there
were
to
be
more
coincidences
that
night
it
never
rains
them
but
it
pours
so
our
three
friends
finished
their
coffee
and
liqueured
up
and
went
to
cornelys
three
in
a
hansom
like
mars
their
poipes
and
cigyars
sir
louis
cornelys
as
everybody
knows
lives
in
a
palace
on
campden
hill
a
house
of
many
windows
and
whichever
window
he
looks
out
of
he
sees
his
own
garden
and
very
little
else
in
spite
of
his
eighty
years
he
works
as
hard
as
ever
and
his
hand
has
lost
but
little
of
its
cunning
but
he
no
longer
gives
those
splendid
parties
that
made
him
almost
as
famous
a
host
as
he
was
an
artist
illustration
their
poipes
and
cigyars
when
his
beautiful
wife
died
he
shut
himself
up
from
the
world
and
now
he
never
stirs
out
of
his
house
and
grounds
except
to
fulfil
his
duties
at
the
royal
academy
and
dine
once
a
year
with
the
queen
it
was
very
different
in
the
early
sixties
there
was
no
pleasanter
or
more
festive
house
than
his
in
london
winter
or
summer
no
lordlier
host
than
he
no
more
irresistible
hostesses
than
lady
cornelys
and
her
lovely
daughters
and
if
ever
music
had
a
right
to
call
itself
divine
it
was
there
you
heard
it
on
late
saturday
nights
during
the
london
season
when
the
foreign
birds
of
song
come
over
to
reap
their
harvest
in
london
town
it
was
on
one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
these
saturday
nights
that
taffy
and
the
laird
chaperoned
by
little
billee
made
their
début
at
mechelen
lodge
and
were
received
at
the
door
of
the
immense
by
a
tall
powerful
man
with
splendid
eyes
and
a
gray
beard
and
a
small
velvet
cap
on
his
head
and
by
a
greek
matron
so
beautiful
and
stately
and
magnificently
attired
that
they
felt
inclined
to
sink
them
on
their
bended
knees
as
in
the
presence
of
some
overwhelming
eastern
royalty
and
were
only
prevented
from
doing
so
perhaps
by
the
simple
sweet
and
cordial
graciousness
of
her
welcome
and
whom
should
they
be
shaking
hands
with
next
but
antony
lorrimer
and
the
greek
with
each
a
beard
and
mustache
of
nearly
five
growth
but
they
had
no
time
for
much
exuberant
greeting
for
there
was
a
sudden
piano
crash
and
then
an
immediate
silence
as
though
for
pins
to
drop
and
signor
giuglini
and
the
wondrous
maiden
adelina
patti
sang
the
miserere
out
of
signor
verdi
most
famous
opera
to
the
delight
of
all
but
a
few
very
superior
ones
who
had
just
read
mendelssohn
letters
or
misread
them
and
despised
italian
music
and
thought
cheaply
of
mere
virtuosity
either
vocal
or
instrumental
when
this
was
over
little
billee
pointed
out
all
the
lions
to
his
friends
from
the
prime
minister
down
to
the
present
scribe
who
was
right
glad
to
meet
them
again
and
talk
of
auld
lang
syne
and
present
them
to
the
daughters
of
the
house
and
other
charming
ladies
then
roucouly
the
great
french
barytone
sang
durien
favorite
song
plaisir
ne
dure
moment
chagrin
dure
toute
la
vie
with
quite
a
little
voice
but
quite
as
divinely
as
he
had
sung
noël
noël
at
the
madeleine
in
full
blast
one
certain
christmas
eve
our
three
friends
remembered
well
then
there
was
a
violin
solo
by
young
joachim
then
as
now
the
greatest
violinist
of
his
time
and
a
solo
on
the
by
madame
schumann
his
only
peeress
and
these
came
as
a
wholesome
check
to
the
levity
of
those
for
whom
all
music
is
but
an
agreeable
pastime
a
mere
emotional
delight
in
which
the
intellect
has
no
part
and
also
as
a
humiliation
to
all
virtuosi
who
play
so
charmingly
that
they
make
their
listeners
forget
the
master
who
invented
the
music
in
the
lesser
master
who
interprets
it
for
these
two
man
and
woman
the
highest
of
their
kind
never
let
you
forget
it
was
sebastian
bach
they
were
playing
playing
in
absolute
perfection
in
absolute
forgetfulness
of
themselves
so
that
if
you
were
up
to
bach
you
did
have
a
very
good
time
but
if
you
were
or
wished
it
to
be
understood
or
thought
you
were
you
seized
your
opportunity
and
you
scored
and
by
the
earnestness
of
your
rapt
and
tranced
immobility
and
the
stony
intensity
of
your
gaze
you
rebuked
the
frivolous
as
you
had
rebuked
them
before
by
the
listlessness
and
carelessness
of
your
bored
resignation
to
the
signorina
patti
trills
and
fioritures
or
roucouly
pretty
little
french
mannerisms
and
what
added
so
much
to
the
charm
of
this
delightful
concert
was
that
the
guests
were
not
packed
together
sardinewise
as
they
are
at
most
concerts
they
were
comparatively
few
and
well
chosen
and
could
get
up
and
walk
about
and
talk
to
their
friends
between
the
pieces
and
wander
off
into
other
rooms
and
look
at
endless
beautiful
things
and
stroll
in
the
lovely
grounds
by
moon
or
star
or
light
and
there
the
frivolous
could
sit
and
chat
and
laugh
and
flirt
when
bach
was
being
played
inside
and
the
earnest
wander
up
and
down
together
in
through
darkened
walks
and
groves
and
alleys
where
the
sound
of
french
or
italian
warblings
could
not
reach
them
and
talk
in
earnest
tones
of
the
great
zola
or
guy
de
maupassant
and
pierre
loti
and
exult
in
beautiful
english
over
the
inferiority
of
english
literature
english
art
english
music
english
everything
else
for
these
ones
who
can
only
bear
the
sight
of
classical
pictures
and
the
sound
of
classical
music
do
not
necessarily
read
classical
books
in
any
language
no
shakespeares
or
dantes
or
molières
or
goethes
for
they
know
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
and
the
mere
fact
that
these
three
immortal
french
writers
of
light
books
i
have
just
named
had
never
been
heard
of
at
this
particular
period
does
very
much
matter
they
had
cognate
predecessors
whose
names
i
happen
to
forget
any
stick
will
do
to
beat
a
dog
with
and
history
is
always
repeating
itself
feydeau
or
flaubert
let
us
say
or
for
those
who
do
know
french
and
cultivate
an
innocent
mind
miss
austen
for
to
be
dead
and
buried
is
almost
as
good
as
to
be
french
and
immoral
and
sebastian
bach
and
sandro
botticelli
that
all
the
arts
should
be
represented
these
names
are
rather
discrepant
but
they
made
very
good
sticks
for
and
with
a
thorough
knowledge
and
appreciation
of
these
or
the
semblance
thereof
you
were
well
equipped
in
those
days
to
hold
your
own
among
the
elect
of
intellectual
london
circles
and
snub
the
philistine
to
rights
then
very
late
a
tall
swarthy
foreigner
came
in
with
a
roll
of
music
in
his
hands
and
his
entrance
made
quite
a
stir
you
heard
all
round
here
glorioli
or
ecco
glorioli
or
voici
glorioli
till
glorioli
got
on
your
nerves
and
beautiful
ladies
ambassadresses
female
celebrities
of
all
kinds
fluttered
up
to
him
and
cajoled
and
fawned
as
svengali
would
have
said
prinzessen
comtessen
serene
english
altessen
and
they
soon
forgot
their
highness
and
their
serenity
for
with
very
little
pressing
glorioli
stood
up
on
the
platform
with
his
accompanist
by
his
side
at
the
piano
and
in
his
hands
a
sheet
of
music
at
which
he
never
looked
he
looked
at
the
beautiful
ladies
and
ogled
and
smiled
and
from
his
scarcely
parted
moist
thick
bearded
lips
which
he
always
licked
before
singing
there
issued
the
most
ravishing
sounds
that
had
ever
been
heard
from
throat
of
man
or
woman
or
boy
he
could
sing
both
high
and
low
and
soft
and
loud
and
the
frivolous
were
bewitched
as
was
only
to
be
expected
but
even
the
earnestest
of
all
caught
surprised
rapt
astounded
shaken
tickled
teased
harrowed
tortured
tantalized
aggravated
seduced
demoralized
corrupted
into
naturalness
forgot
to
dissemble
their
delight
and
sebastian
bach
the
especially
adored
of
all
really
great
musicians
and
also
alas
of
many
priggish
outsiders
who
do
know
a
single
note
and
ca
remember
a
single
tune
was
well
forgotten
for
the
night
and
who
were
more
enthusiastic
than
the
two
great
players
who
had
been
playing
bach
that
evening
for
these
at
all
events
were
broad
and
catholic
and
sincere
and
knew
what
was
beautiful
whatever
its
kind
illustration
bonjour
suzon
it
was
but
a
simple
little
song
that
glorioli
sang
as
light
and
pretty
as
it
could
well
be
almost
worthy
of
the
words
it
was
written
to
and
the
words
are
de
musset
and
i
love
them
so
much
i
can
not
resist
the
temptation
of
setting
them
down
here
for
the
mere
sensuous
delight
of
writing
them
as
though
i
had
just
composed
them
myself
bonjour
suzon
ma
fleur
des
bois
toujours
la
plus
jolie
je
reviens
tel
que
tu
me
vois
grand

je

bonjour
suzon
and
when
it
began
and
while
it
lasted
and
after
it
was
over
one
felt
really
sorry
for
all
the
other
singers
and
nobody
sang
any
more
that
night
for
glorioli
was
tired
and
would
sing
again
and
none
were
bold
enough
or
disinterested
enough
to
sing
after
him
some
of
my
readers
may
remember
that
meteoric
bird
of
song
who
though
a
mere
amateur
would
condescend
to
sing
for
a
hundred
guineas
in
the
saloons
of
the
great
as
monsieur
jourdain
sold
cloth
who
would
sing
still
better
for
love
and
glory
in
the
studios
of
his
friends
for
glorioli
the
biggest
handsomest
and
most
jew
that
ever
was
one
of
the
sephardim
one
of
the
seraphim
hailed
from
spain
where
he
was
junior
partner
in
the
great
firm
of
moralés
peralés
gonzalés
glorioli
malaga
he
travelled
for
his
own
firm
his
wine
was
good
and
he
sold
much
of
it
in
england
but
his
voice
would
bring
him
far
more
gold
in
the
month
he
spent
here
for
his
wines
have
been
equalled
even
surpassed
but
there
was
no
voice
like
his
anywhere
in
the
world
and
no
more
finished
singer
anyhow
his
voice
got
into
little
billee
head
more
than
any
wine
and
the
boy
could
talk
of
nothing
else
for
days
and
weeks
and
was
so
exuberant
in
his
expressions
of
delight
and
gratitude
that
the
great
singer
took
a
real
fancy
to
him
especially
when
he
was
told
that
this
fervent
boyish
admirer
was
one
of
the
greatest
of
english
painters
and
as
a
mark
of
his
esteem
privately
confided
to
him
after
supper
that
every
century
two
human
nightingales
were
born
only
two
a
male
and
a
female
and
that
he
glorioli
was
the
representative
male
rossignol
of
this
siècle
i
can
well
believe
that
and
the
female
your
mate
that
should
be
if
there
is
such
a
word
inquired
little
billee
ah
mon
ami
it
was
alboni
till
la
petite
adelina
patti
came
out
a
year
or
two
ago
and
now
it
is
la
svengali
oui
mon
fy
you
will
hear
her
some
day
et
vous
direz
des
nouvelles
why
you
do
mean
to
say
that
she
got
a
better
voice
than
madame
alboni
mon
ami
an
apple
is
an
excellent
thing
until
you
have
tried
a
peach
her
voice
to
that
of
alboni
is
as
a
peach
to
an
apple
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
but
bah
the
voice
is
a
detail
it
what
she
does
with
it
it
incredible
it
gives
one
cold
all
down
the
back
it
drives
you
mad
it
makes
you
weep
hot
tears
by
the
spoonful
ah
the
tear
mon
fy
tenez
i
can
draw
everything
but
ça
pas
dans
mes
cordes
can
only
madden
with
but
la
svengali
and
then
in
the
middle
of
it
all
prrrout
she
makes
you
laugh
ah
le
beau
rire
faire
rire
avec
des
larmes
plein
les
yeux
voilà
qui
me
passe
mon
ami
when
i
heard
her
it
made
me
swear
that
even
would
never
try
to
sing
any
more
it
seemed
absurd
and
i
kept
my
word
for
a
month
at
least
and
you
know
je
sais
ce
que
je
vaux
moi
you
are
talking
of
la
svengali
i
bet
said
signor
spartia
oui
parbleu
you
have
heard
her
yes
at
vienna
last
winter
rejoined
the
greatest
in
the
world
suis
fou
hélas
i
thought
could
teach
a
woman
how
to
sing
till
i
heard
that
blackguard
svengali
pupil
he
has
married
her
they
say
illustration
a
human
nightingale
that
svengali
exclaimed
little
billee
why
that
must
be
a
svengali
i
knew
in
paris
a
famous
pianist
a
friend
of
mine
that
the
man
also
une
fameuse
crapule
sauf
vot
respect
his
real
name
is
adler
his
mother
was
a
polish
singer
and
he
was
a
pupil
at
the
leipsic
conservatorio
but
he
an
immense
artist
and
a
great
to
teach
a
woman
like
that
and
such
a
woman
belle
comme
un
ange
mais
bête
comme
un
pot
i
tried
to
talk
to
her
all
she
can
say
is
wohl
or
or
or
not
a
word
of
english
or
french
or
italian
though
she
sings
them
oh
but
it
is
bel
come
back
to
the
world
after
a
hundred
years
but
what
voice
is
it
asked
little
billee
every
voice
a
mortal
woman
can
have
three
octaves
four
and
of
such
a
quality
that
people
who
ca
tell
one
tune
from
another
cry
with
pleasure
at
the
mere
sound
of
it
directly
they
hear
her
just
like
anybody
else
everything
that
paganini
could
do
with
his
violin
she
does
with
her
voice
only
better
and
what
a
voice

i
wonder
now
why
that
must
be
the
woman
i
heard
at
warsaw
two
years
ago
or
three
said
young
lord
witlow
it
was
at
count
siloszech
he
heard
her
sing
in
the
streets
with
a
tall
ruffian
who
accompanied
her
on
a
guitar
and
a
little
fiddling
gypsy
fellow
she
was
a
handsome
woman
with
hair
down
to
her
knees
but
stupid
as
an
owl
she
sang
at
siloszech
and
all
the
fellows
went
mad
and
gave
her
their
watches
and
diamond
studs
and
gold
by
gad
i
never
heard
or
saw
anything
like
it
i
do
know
much
about
music
myself
tell
save
the
queen
from
goes
the
weasel
if
the
people
did
get
up
and
stand
and
take
their
hats
off
but
i
was
as
mad
as
the
rest
why
i
gave
her
a
little
german
silver
vinaigrette
i
just
bought
for
my
wife
hanged
if
i
did
and
i
was
only
just
married
you
know
it
the
peculiar
twang
of
her
voice
i
suppose
and
hearing
all
this
little
billee
made
up
his
mind
that
life
had
still
something
in
store
for
him
since
he
would
some
day
hear
la
svengali
anyhow
he
would
shoot
himself
till
then
thus
the
night
wore
itself
away
the
prinzessen
comtessen
and
serene
english
altessen
and
other
ladies
of
less
exalted
rank
departed
home
in
cabs
and
carriages
and
hostess
and
daughters
went
to
bed
late
sitters
of
the
ruder
sex
supped
again
and
smoked
and
chatted
and
listened
to
comic
songs
and
recitations
by
celebrated
actors
noble
dukes
hobnobbed
with
low
comedians
painters
and
sculptors
sat
at
the
feet
of
hebrew
capitalists
and
aitchless
millionaires
judges
cabinet
ministers
eminent
physicians
and
warriors
and
philosophers
saw
sunday
morning
steal
over
campden
hill
and
through
the
many
windows
of
mechelen
lodge
and
listened
to
the
pipe
of
birds
and
smelled
the
freshness
of
the
dark
summer
dawn
and
as
taffy
and
the
laird
walked
home
to
the
old
hummums
by
daylight
they
felt
that
last
night
was
ages
ago
and
that
since
then
they
had
foregathered
with
much
there
was
of
the
best
in
london
and
then
they
reflected
that
much
there
was
of
the
best
in
london
were
still
strangers
to
them
except
by
reputation
for
there
had
not
been
time
for
many
introductions
and
this
had
made
them
feel
a
little
out
of
it
and
they
found
they
had
had
such
a
very
good
time
after
all
and
there
were
no
cabs
and
they
were
tired
and
their
boots
were
tight
and
the
last
they
had
seen
of
little
billee
before
leaving
was
a
glimpse
of
their
old
friend
in
a
corner
of
lady
cornelys
boudoir
gravely
playing
with
fred
walker
for
sixpences
both
so
rapt
in
the
game
that
they
were
unconscious
of
anything
else
and
both
playing
so
well
with
either
hand
that
they
might
have
been
professional
champions
and
that
saturnine
young
sawbones
jakes
talboys
now
sir
jakes
and
one
of
the
most
genial
of
her
majesty
physicians
who
sometimes
after
supper
and
champagne
was
given
to
thoughtful
sympathetic
and
acute
observation
of
his
remarked
to
the
laird
in
a
whisper
that
was
almost
convivial
rather
an
enviable
pair
their
united
ages
amount
to
or
so
their
united
weights
to
about
fifteen
stone
and
they
could
carry
you
or
me
between
them
but
if
you
were
to
roll
all
the
other
brains
that
have
been
under
this
roof
into
one
you
would
reach
the
sum
of
their
united
genius
i
wonder
which
of
the
two
is
the
most
unhappy
the
season
over
the
flown
summer
on
the
wane
his
picture
the
sent
to
moses
lyon
the
in
conduit
street
little
billee
felt
the
time
had
come
to
go
and
see
his
mother
and
sister
in
devonshire
and
make
the
sun
shine
twice
as
brightly
for
them
during
a
month
or
so
and
the
dew
fall
softer
so
one
fine
august
morning
found
him
at
the
great
western
station
the
nicest
station
in
all
london
i
think
except
the
stations
that
book
you
to
france
and
far
away
it
always
seems
so
pleasant
to
be
going
west
little
billee
loved
that
station
and
often
went
there
for
a
mere
stroll
to
watch
the
people
starting
on
their
westward
way
following
the
sun
towards
heaven
knows
what
joys
or
sorrows
and
envy
them
their
sorrows
or
their
joys
any
sorrows
or
joys
that
were
not
merely
physical
like
a
chocolate
drop
or
a
pretty
tune
a
bad
smell
or
a
toothache
and
as
he
took
a
seat
in
a
carriage
it
would
be
third
in
these
democratic
days
south
corner
back
to
the
engine
with
and
darwin
of
which
he
was
reading
for
the
third
time
and
and
other
literature
of
a
lighter
kind
to
beguile
him
on
his
journey
he
felt
rather
bitterly
how
happy
he
could
be
if
the
little
spot
or
knot
or
blot
or
clot
which
paralyzed
that
convolution
of
his
brain
where
he
kept
his
affections
could
but
be
conjured
away
the
dearest
mother
the
dearest
sister
in
the
world
in
the
dearest
little
village
or
town
that
ever
was
and
other
dear
people
especially
alice
sweet
alice
with
hair
so
brown
his
friend
the
simple
pure
and
pious
maiden
of
his
boyish
dreams
and
himself
but
for
that
wretched
little
cerebral
occlusion
as
sound
as
healthy
as
full
of
life
and
energy
as
he
had
ever
been
illustration
and
when
he
was
reading
or
looking
out
of
window
at
the
flying
landscape
and
watching
it
revolve
round
its
middle
distance
as
it
always
seems
to
do
he
was
sympathetically
taking
stock
of
his
and
mildly
envying
them
one
after
another
indiscriminately
a
fat
old
wheezy
philistine
with
a
bulbous
nose
and
only
one
eye
who
had
a
plain
sickly
daughter
to
whom
he
seemed
devoted
body
and
soul
an
old
lady
who
still
wept
furtively
at
recollections
of
the
parting
with
her
grandchildren
which
had
taken
place
at
the
station
they
had
borne
up
wonderfully
as
grandchildren
do
a
consumptive
curate
on
the
opposite
corner
seat
by
the
window
whose
tender
anxious
wife
sitting
by
his
side
seemed
to
have
no
thoughts
in
the
whole
world
but
for
him
and
her
patient
eyes
were
his
stars
of
consolation
since
he
turned
to
look
into
them
almost
every
minute
and
always
seemed
a
little
the
happier
for
doing
so
there
is
no
better
than
that
so
little
billee
gave
her
up
corner
seat
that
the
poor
sufferer
might
have
those
stars
where
he
could
look
into
them
comfortably
without
turning
his
head
indeed
as
was
his
wont
with
everybody
little
billee
made
himself
useful
and
pleasant
to
his
in
many
ways
so
many
that
long
before
they
had
reached
their
respective
journeys
ends
they
had
almost
grown
to
love
him
as
an
old
friend
and
longed
to
know
who
this
singularly
attractive
and
brilliant
youth
this
genial
dainty
benevolent
little
princekin
could
possibly
be
who
was
dressed
so
fashionably
and
yet
went
second
class
and
took
such
kind
thought
of
others
and
they
wondered
at
the
happiness
that
must
be
his
at
merely
being
alive
and
told
him
more
of
their
troubles
in
six
hours
than
they
told
many
an
old
friend
in
a
year
but
he
told
them
nothing
about
himself
that
self
he
was
so
sick
of
and
left
them
to
wonder
and
at
his
own
journey
end
the
farthest
end
of
all
he
found
his
mother
and
sister
waiting
for
him
in
a
beautiful
little
his
last
gift
and
with
them
sweet
alice
and
in
her
eyes
for
one
brief
moment
that
unconscious
look
of
love
surprised
which
is
not
to
be
forgotten
for
years
and
years
and
years
which
can
only
be
seen
by
the
eyes
that
meet
it
and
which
for
the
time
it
lasts
just
a
flash
makes
all
women
eyes
look
exactly
the
same
i
told
and
it
seemed
to
little
billee
that
for
the
twentieth
part
of
a
second
alice
had
looked
at
him
with
trilby
eyes
or
his
mother
when
that
he
was
a
little
tiny
boy
it
all
but
gave
him
the
thrill
he
thirsted
for
another
twentieth
part
of
a
second
perhaps
and
his
would
have
melted
away
and
little
billee
would
have
come
into
his
own
again
the
kingdom
of
love
a
beautiful
human
eye
beautiful
eye
a
dog
a
deer
a
donkey
an
owl
even
to
think
of
all
that
it
can
look
and
all
that
it
can
see
all
that
it
can
even
sometimes
what
a
prince
among
gems
what
a
star
but
a
beautiful
eye
that
lets
the
broad
white
light
of
infinite
space
so
bewildering
and
garish
and
diffused
into
one
pure
virgin
heart
to
be
filtered
there
and
lets
it
out
again
duly
warmed
softened
concentrated
sublimated
focussed
to
a
point
as
in
a
precious
stone
that
it
may
shed
itself
a
effulgence
into
some
stray
close
by
through
pupil
and
iris
entre
the
very
elixir
of
life
alas
that
such
a
should
ever
lose
its
lustre
and
go
blind
not
so
blind
or
dim
however
but
it
can
still
see
well
enough
to
look
before
and
after
and
inward
and
upward
and
drown
itself
in
tears
and
yet
not
die
and
that
the
dreadful
pity
of
it
and
this
is
a
quite
digression
and
i
ca
think
why
i
should
have
gone
out
of
my
way
at
considerable
pains
to
invent
it
in
fact
of
this
here
song
should
i
be
axed
the
reason
for
to
show
i
do
exactly
know
i
do
exactly
know
all
my
fancy
dwells
upon
how
pretty
alice
has
grown
mother
quite
lovely
i
think
and
so
nice
but
she
was
always
as
nice
as
she
could
be
so
observed
little
billee
to
his
mother
that
evening
as
they
sat
in
the
garden
and
watched
the
crescent
moon
sink
to
the
atlantic
ah
my
darling
willie
if
you
only
guess
how
happy
you
would
make
your
poor
old
mammy
by
growing
fond
of
alice
and
blanche
too
what
a
joy
for
good
heavens
mother
alice
is
not
for
the
likes
of
she
for
some
splendid
young
devon
squire
six
foot
high
and
acred
and
whiskered
within
an
inch
of
his
life
ah
my
darling
willie
you
are
not
of
those
who
ask
for
love
in
vain
if
you
only
how
she
believes
in
you
she
almost
beats
your
poor
old
mammy
at
illustration
sweet
alice
and
that
night
he
dreamed
of
alice
that
he
loved
her
as
a
sweet
good
woman
should
be
loved
and
knew
even
in
his
dream
that
it
was
but
a
dream
but
oh
it
was
good
and
he
managed
not
to
wake
and
it
was
a
night
to
be
marked
with
a
white
stone
and
still
in
his
dream
she
had
kissed
him
and
healed
him
of
his
forever
but
when
he
woke
next
morning
alas
his
was
with
him
still
and
he
felt
that
no
dream
kiss
would
ever
cure
it
nothing
but
a
real
kiss
from
alice
own
pure
lips
and
he
rose
thinking
of
alice
and
dressed
and
breakfasted
thinking
of
her
and
how
fair
she
was
and
how
innocent
and
how
well
and
carefully
trained
up
the
way
she
should
go
the
beau
ideal
of
a
wife
could
she
possibly
care
for
a
shrimp
like
himself
for
in
his
love
of
outward
form
he
could
not
understand
that
any
woman
who
had
eyes
to
see
should
ever
quite
condone
the
signs
of
physical
weakness
in
man
in
favor
of
any
mental
gifts
or
graces
whatsoever
little
greek
that
he
was
he
worshipped
the
athlete
and
opined
that
all
women
without
exception
all
english
women
especially
must
see
with
the
same
eyes
as
himself
he
had
once
been
vain
and
weak
enough
to
believe
in
trilby
love
with
a
taffy
standing
by
a
careless
unsusceptible
taffy
who
was
like
unto
the
gods
of
olympus
and
trilby
had
given
him
up
at
a
word
a
hint
for
all
his
frantic
clinging
she
would
not
have
given
up
taffy
si
had
taffy
but
lifted
a
little
finger
it
is
always
just
whistle
and
i
come
to
you
my
lad
with
the
likes
of
taffy
but
taffy
had
even
whistled
yet
still
he
kept
thinking
of
alice
and
he
felt
he
could
think
of
her
well
enough
till
he
went
out
for
a
stroll
by
himself
on
a
down
so
he
took
his
pipe
and
his
darwin
and
out
he
strolled
into
the
early
sunshine
up
the
green
red
lane
past
the
pretty
church
father
church
and
there
at
the
gate
patiently
waiting
for
his
mistress
sat
alice
dog
an
old
friend
of
his
whose
welcome
was
a
very
warm
one
little
billee
thought
of
thackeray
lovely
poem
in
she
comes
she
here
she
past
may
heaven
go
with
her
then
he
and
the
dog
went
on
together
to
a
little
bench
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
within
sight
of
alice
bedroom
window
it
was
called
the
honeymooners
bench
that
look
that
look
that
look
ah
but
trilby
had
looked
like
that
too
and
there
are
many
taffys
in
devon
he
sat
himself
down
and
smoked
and
gazed
at
the
sea
below
which
the
sun
still
in
the
east
had
not
yet
filled
with
glare
and
robbed
of
the
lovely
shot
with
purple
and
dark
green
that
comes
over
it
now
and
again
of
a
morning
on
that
most
beautiful
coast
there
was
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
west
and
the
long
slow
billows
broke
into
creamier
foam
than
ever
which
reflected
itself
as
a
tender
white
gleam
in
the
blue
concavities
of
their
shining
shoreward
curves
as
they
came
rolling
in
the
sky
was
all
of
turquoise
but
for
the
smoke
of
a
distant
steamer
a
long
thin
horizontal
streak
of
dun
and
there
were
little
brown
or
white
sails
here
and
there
dotting
and
the
stately
ships
went
on
little
billee
tried
hard
to
feel
all
this
beauty
with
his
heart
as
well
as
his
brain
as
he
had
so
often
done
when
a
boy
and
cursed
his
insensibility
out
loud
for
at
least
the
thousand
and
first
time
why
could
these
waves
of
air
and
water
be
turned
into
equivalent
waves
of
sound
that
he
might
feel
them
through
the
only
channel
that
reached
his
emotions
that
one
joy
was
still
left
to
him
but
alas
alas
he
was
only
a
painter
of
pictures
and
not
a
maker
of
music
he
recited
break
break
break
to
alice
dog
who
loved
him
and
looked
up
into
his
face
with
sapient
affectionate
eyes
and
whose
name
like
that
of
so
many
dogs
in
fiction
and
so
few
in
fact
was
simply
tray
for
little
billee
was
much
given
to
monologues
out
loud
and
profuse
quotations
from
his
favorite
bards
everybody
quoted
that
particular
poem
either
mentally
or
aloud
when
they
sat
on
that
particular
bench
except
a
few
people
who
still
said
roll
on
thou
deep
and
dark
blue
ocean
roll
or
people
of
the
very
highest
culture
who
only
quoted
the
nascent
and
crescent
robert
browning
or
people
of
no
culture
at
all
who
simply
held
their
tongues
and
only
felt
the
more
tray
listened
silently
ah
tray
the
best
thing
but
one
to
do
with
the
sea
is
to
paint
it
the
next
best
thing
to
that
is
to
bathe
in
it
the
best
of
all
is
to
lie
asleep
at
the
bottom
how
would
like
that
on
thy
ribs
the
limpet
sticks
and
in
thy
heart
the
scrawl
shall
play
tray
tail
became
as
a
wagging
point
of
interrogation
and
he
turned
his
head
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
his
eyes
fixed
on
little
billee
his
face
irresistible
in
its
genial
doggy
wistfulness
tray
what
a
singularly
good
listener
you
are
and
therefore
what
singularly
good
manners
you
got
i
suppose
all
dogs
have
said
little
billee
and
then
in
a
very
tender
voice
he
exclaimed
alice
alice
alice
and
tray
uttered
a
soft
cooing
nasal
croon
in
his
head
register
though
he
was
a
barytone
dog
by
nature
with
portentous
warlike
of
the
jingo
order
tray
your
mistress
is
a
parson
daughter
and
therefore
twice
as
much
of
a
mystery
as
any
other
woman
in
this
puzzling
world
tray
if
my
heart
were
stopped
with
wax
like
the
ears
of
the
companions
of
ulysses
when
they
rowed
past
the
sirens
you
heard
of
ulysses
tray
he
loved
a
dog
if
my
heart
were
stopped
with
wax
i
should
be
deeply
in
love
with
your
mistress
perhaps
she
would
marry
me
if
i
asked
her
there
no
accounting
for
tastes
and
i
know
enough
of
myself
to
know
that
i
should
make
her
a
good
husband
that
i
should
make
her
happy
and
i
should
make
two
other
women
happy
besides
as
for
myself
personally
tray
it
does
very
much
matter
one
good
woman
would
do
as
well
as
another
if
she
equally
you
doubt
it
wait
till
you
get
a
pimple
inside
your
bump
of
your
bump
of
wherever
you
keep
your
fondnesses
tray
for
that
what
the
matter
with
me
a
pimple
just
a
little
clot
of
blood
at
the
root
of
a
nerve
and
no
bigger
than
a
pin
point
that
a
small
thing
to
cause
such
a
lot
of
wretchedness
and
wreck
a
fellow
life
is
it
oh
curse
it
curse
it
curse
it
every
day
and
all
day
long
and
just
as
small
a
thing
will
take
it
away
i
told
ah
grains
of
sand
are
small
things
and
so
are
diamonds
but
diamond
or
grain
of
sand
only
alice
has
got
that
small
thing
alice
alone
in
all
the
world
has
got
the
healing
touch
for
me
now
the
hands
the
lips
the
eyes
i
know
it
i
feel
it
i
dreamed
it
last
night
she
looked
me
well
in
the
face
and
took
my
hand
both
hands
and
kissed
me
eyes
and
mouth
and
told
me
how
she
loved
me
ah
what
a
dream
it
was
and
my
little
clot
melted
away
like
a
on
the
lips
and
i
was
my
old
self
again
after
many
years
and
all
through
that
kiss
of
a
pure
woman
i
never
been
kissed
by
a
pure
woman
in
my
life
never
except
by
my
dear
mother
and
sister
and
mothers
and
sisters
do
count
when
it
comes
to
kissing
ah
sweet
physician
that
she
is
and
better
than
all
it
will
all
come
back
again
with
a
rush
just
as
i
dreamed
and
we
will
have
a
good
time
together
we
three
illustration
may
heaven
go
with
her
but
your
mistress
is
a
parson
daughter
and
believes
everything
been
taught
from
a
child
just
as
you
do
at
least
i
hope
so
and
i
like
her
for
it
and
you
too
she
has
believed
her
father
will
she
ever
believe
me
who
think
so
differently
and
if
she
does
will
it
be
good
for
her
and
then
where
will
her
father
come
in
oh
it
a
bad
thing
to
live
and
no
longer
believe
and
trust
in
your
father
tray
to
doubt
either
his
honesty
or
his
intelligence
for
he
with
your
mother
to
help
has
taught
you
all
the
best
he
knows
if
he
has
been
a
good
father
till
some
one
else
comes
and
teaches
you
better
or
worse
and
then
what
are
you
to
believe
of
what
good
still
remains
of
all
that
early
teaching
and
how
are
you
to
sift
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
kneel
undisturbed
fair
saint
i
for
one
will
never
seek
to
undermine
thy
faith
in
any
father
on
earth
or
above
it
yes
there
she
kneels
in
her
father
church
her
pretty
head
bowed
over
her
clasped
hands
her
cloak
and
skirts
falling
in
happy
folds
about
her
i
see
it
all
and
underneath
that
poor
sweet
soft
pathetic
thing
of
flesh
and
blood
the
eternal
woman
great
heart
and
slender
brain
forever
enslaved
or
enslaving
never
never
free
that
dear
weak
delicate
shape
so
cherishable
so
perishable
that
i
had
to
paint
so
often
and
know
so
well
by
heart
and
love
ah
how
i
love
it
only
and
can
ever
quite
know
the
fulness
of
that
pure
love
there
she
kneels
and
pours
forth
her
praise
or
plaint
meekly
and
duly
perhaps
it
for
me
she
praying
thou
thy
sister
when
she
prays
she
believes
her
poor
little
prayer
will
be
heard
and
answered
somewhere
up
aloft
the
impossible
will
be
done
she
wants
what
she
wants
so
badly
and
prays
for
it
so
hard
she
believes
she
believes
what
she
believe
tray
the
world
was
made
in
six
days
it
is
just
six
thousand
years
old
once
it
all
lay
smothered
under
for
many
weeks
miles
deep
because
there
were
so
many
wicked
people
about
somewhere
down
in
where
they
did
know
everything
a
costly
kind
of
clearance
and
then
there
was
noah
who
wicked
and
his
most
respectable
family
and
his
ark
and
jonah
and
his
whale
and
joshua
and
the
sun
and
what
not
i
remember
it
all
you
see
and
oh
such
wonderful
things
that
have
happened
since
and
there
everlasting
agony
for
those
who
do
believe
as
she
does
and
yet
she
is
happy
and
good
and
very
kind
for
the
mere
thought
of
any
live
creature
in
pain
makes
her
wretched
after
all
if
she
believes
in
me
she
believe
in
anything
let
her
indeed
i
not
sure
that
it
not
rather
ungainly
for
a
pretty
woman
to
believe
in
all
these
good
old
cosmic
taradiddles
as
it
is
for
a
pretty
child
not
to
believe
in
little
red
and
jack
and
the
beanstalk
and
morgiana
and
the
forty
thieves
we
learn
them
at
our
mother
knee
and
how
nice
they
are
let
us
go
on
believing
them
as
long
as
we
can
till
the
child
grows
up
and
the
woman
dies
and
it
all
found
out
yes
tray
i
will
be
dishonest
for
her
dear
sake
i
will
kneel
by
her
side
if
ever
i
have
the
happy
chance
and
ever
after
night
and
morning
and
all
day
long
on
sundays
if
she
wants
me
to
what
will
i
do
for
that
one
pretty
woman
who
believes
in
i
will
respect
even
belief
and
do
my
little
best
to
keep
it
alive
forever
it
is
much
too
precious
an
earthly
boon
for
to
play
ducks
and
drakes
with
so
much
for
alice
tray
your
sweet
mistress
and
mine
but
then
there
alice
papa
and
that
another
pair
of
sleeves
as
we
say
in
france
ought
one
ever
to
play
at
with
a
man
for
any
consideration
whatever
even
though
he
be
a
parson
and
a
possible
a
case
of
conscience
for
you
when
i
ask
him
for
his
daughter
as
i
must
and
he
asks
me
for
my
profession
of
faith
as
he
will
what
can
i
tell
him
the
truth
but
then
what
will
say
what
allowances
will
make
for
a
poor
little
waif
of
a
like
me
whose
only
choice
lay
between
darwin
and
the
pope
of
rome
and
who
has
chosen
once
and
forever
and
that
long
ago
before
he
ever
even
heard
of
darwin
name
besides
why
should
he
make
allowances
for
me
i
do
for
him
i
think
no
more
of
a
parson
than
he
does
of
a
and
precious
little
i
afraid
what
will
he
think
of
a
man
who
says
here
the
god
of
your
belief
is
mine
and
never
will
be
but
i
love
your
daughter
and
she
loves
me
and
i
the
only
man
to
make
her
happy
he
no
jephthah
he
made
of
flesh
and
blood
although
he
a
parson
and
loves
his
daughter
as
much
as
shylock
loved
his
tell
me
tray
thou
that
livest
among
parsons
what
man
not
being
a
parson
himself
can
guess
how
a
parson
would
think
an
average
parson
confronted
by
such
a
poser
as
that
does
he
dare
he
he
ever
think
straight
or
simply
on
any
subject
as
any
other
man
thinks
hedged
in
as
he
is
by
so
many
limitations
he
is
as
shrewd
vain
worldly
ambitious
jealous
censorious
and
all
the
rest
as
you
or
i
tray
for
all
his
christian
profession
and
just
as
fond
of
his
kith
and
kin
he
is
considered
a
gentleman
which
perhaps
you
and
i
are
not
unless
we
happen
to
behave
as
such
it
is
a
condition
of
his
noble
calling
perhaps
it
in
order
to
become
a
gentleman
that
he
become
a
parson
it
about
as
short
a
royal
road
as
any
to
that
enviable
distinction
as
short
almost
as
her
majesty
commission
and
much
safer
and
much
less
expensive
within
reach
of
the
sons
of
most
fairly
successful
butchers
and
bakers
and
while
still
a
boy
he
has
bound
himself
irrevocably
to
certain
beliefs
which
he
will
be
paid
to
preserve
and
preach
and
enforce
through
life
and
act
up
to
through
thick
and
thin
at
all
events
in
the
eyes
of
others
even
his
nearest
and
dearest
even
the
wife
of
his
bosom
they
are
his
bread
and
butter
these
beliefs
and
a
man
must
quarrel
with
his
bread
and
butter
but
a
parson
must
quarrel
with
those
who
do
believe
as
he
tells
them
illustration
much
for
alice
tray
yet
a
few
years
thinking
and
reading
and
experience
of
life
one
would
suppose
might
possibly
just
shake
his
faith
a
little
just
as
though
instead
of
being
parson
he
had
been
tinker
tailor
soldier
sailor
gentleman
apothecary
ploughboy
thief
and
teach
him
that
many
of
these
beliefs
are
simply
childish
and
some
of
them
very
wicked
indeed
and
most
immoral
it
is
very
wicked
and
most
immoral
to
believe
or
affect
to
believe
and
tell
others
to
believe
that
the
unseen
unspeakable
unthinkable
immensity
we
all
part
and
parcel
of
source
of
eternal
infinite
indestructible
life
and
light
and
might
is
a
kind
of
wrathful
glorified
and
ogre
in
human
shape
with
human
passions
and
most
inhuman
hates
who
suddenly
made
us
out
of
nothing
one
fine
day
just
for
a
freak
and
made
us
so
badly
that
we
fell
the
next
and
turned
us
adrift
the
day
after
damned
us
from
the
very
beginning
ovo
ab
ovo
usque
ad
ha
ha
and
ever
since
never
gave
us
a
chance
father
indeed
why
the
prince
of
darkness
was
an
angel
in
comparison
and
a
gentleman
into
the
bargain
just
think
of
it
tray
a
finger
in
every
little
paltry
pie
an
eye
and
an
ear
at
every
even
that
of
the
larder
to
catch
us
tripping
and
find
out
if
we
praising
loud
enough
or
grovelling
low
enough
or
fasting
hard
enough
poor
worms
and
if
we
naughty
and
disobedient
everlasting
torment
for
us
torture
of
so
hideous
a
kind
that
we
would
inflict
it
on
the
basest
criminal
not
for
one
single
moment
or
else
if
we
good
and
do
as
we
are
bid
an
eternity
of
bliss
so
futile
so
idle
and
so
tame
that
we
could
stand
it
for
a
week
but
for
thinking
of
its
one
horrible
alternative
and
of
our
poor
brother
for
ever
and
ever
roasting
away
and
howling
for
the
drop
of
water
he
never
gets
everlasting
flame
or
everlasting
dishonor
nothing
between
is
it
ludicrous
as
well
as
pitiful
a
thing
to
make
one
snigger
through
one
tears
is
it
a
grievous
sin
to
believe
in
such
things
as
these
and
go
about
teaching
and
preaching
them
and
being
paid
for
it
a
sin
to
be
heavily
chastised
and
a
shame
what
a
legacy
they
were
shocking
bad
artists
those
conceited
jews
those
poor
old
doting
monks
and
priests
and
bigots
of
the
grewsome
dark
age
of
faith
they
could
draw
a
bit
no
perspective
no
and
it
a
woful
image
they
managed
to
evolve
for
us
out
of
the
depths
of
their
fathomless
ignorance
in
their
zeal
to
keep
us
off
all
the
forbidden
fruit
we
all
so
fond
of
because
we
were
built
like
that
and
by
whom
by
our
maker
i
suppose
who
also
made
the
forbidden
fruit
and
made
it
very
nice
and
put
it
so
conveniently
for
you
and
me
to
see
and
smell
and
reach
tray
and
sometimes
even
pick
alas
and
even
at
that
it
a
failure
only
the
very
foolish
little
birds
are
frightened
into
good
behavior
the
naughty
ones
laugh
and
wink
at
each
other
and
pull
out
its
hair
and
beard
when
nobody
looking
and
build
their
nests
out
of
the
straw
it
stuffed
with
the
naughty
little
birds
in
black
especially
and
pick
up
what
they
want
under
its
very
nose
and
thrive
uncommonly
well
and
the
good
ones
fly
away
out
of
sight
and
some
day
perhaps
find
a
home
in
some
happy
useful
far
away
where
the
father
is
a
bit
like
this
who
knows
and
i
one
of
the
good
little
birds
tray
at
least
i
hope
so
and
that
unknown
father
lives
in
me
whether
i
will
or
no
and
i
love
him
whether
he
be
or
not
just
because
i
ca
help
it
and
with
the
best
and
bravest
love
that
can
be
the
perfect
love
that
believeth
no
evil
and
seeketh
no
reward
and
casteth
out
fear
for
i
his
father
as
much
as
he
mine
since
i
conceived
the
thought
of
him
after
my
own
fashion
and
he
lives
in
you
too
tray
you
and
all
your
kind
yes
good
dog
you
king
of
beasts
i
see
it
in
your
eyes
ah
bon
dieu
père
le
dieu
des
bonnes
gens
oh
if
we
only
knew
for
tray
what
martyrdom
would
we
not
endure
you
and
i
with
a
happy
smile
and
a
grateful
heart
for
sheer
of
such
a
father
how
little
should
care
for
the
things
of
this
earth
but
the
poor
parson
he
must
go
on
believing
or
affecting
to
believe
just
as
he
is
told
for
or
else
to
his
wife
and
bread
and
butter
his
own
preferment
perhaps
even
his
very
gentility
that
gentility
of
which
his
master
thought
so
little
and
he
and
his
are
apt
to
think
so
much
with
possibly
the
archbishopric
of
canterbury
at
the
end
of
it
the
bâton
de
maréchal
that
lies
in
every
clerical
knapsack
what
a
temptation
one
is
but
human
so
how
can
he
be
honest
without
believing
certain
things
to
believe
which
without
shame
one
must
be
as
simple
as
a
little
child
as
he
is
so
cleverly
told
to
be
in
these
matters
and
so
cleverly
tells
us
and
so
seldom
is
himself
in
any
other
matter
whatever
his
own
interests
other
people
affairs
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
and
that
clever
of
him
too
and
if
he
chooses
to
be
as
simple
as
a
little
child
why
should
i
treat
him
as
a
little
child
for
his
own
good
and
fool
him
to
the
top
of
his
little
bent
for
his
dear
daughter
sake
that
i
may
make
her
happy
and
thereby
him
too
and
if
he
quite
so
simple
as
all
that
and
makes
artful
little
compromises
with
his
conscience
for
a
good
purpose
of
course
why
should
i
make
artful
little
compromises
with
mine
and
for
a
better
purpose
still
and
try
to
get
what
i
want
in
the
way
does
i
want
to
marry
his
daughter
far
worse
than
he
can
ever
want
to
live
in
a
palace
and
ride
in
a
carriage
and
pair
with
a
mitre
on
the
panels
if
he
why
should
i
cheat
too
if
cheats
he
cheats
everybody
all
round
the
wide
wide
world
and
something
wider
and
higher
still
that
ca
be
measured
something
in
himself
only
cheat
he
cheats
he
cheats
for
the
sake
of
very
worldly
things
indeed
tithes
honors
influence
power
authority
social
consideration
and
respect
not
to
speak
of
bread
and
butter
only
cheat
for
the
love
of
a
lady
fair
and
cheating
for
cheating
i
like
my
cheating
best
so
whether
he
cheats
or
not
i
confound
it
what
would
old
taffy
do
in
such
a
case
i
wonder
oh
bother
it
no
good
wondering
what
old
taffy
would
do
taffy
never
wants
to
marry
daughter
he
does
even
want
to
paint
her
he
only
wants
to
paint
his
beastly
ragamuffins
and
thieves
and
drunkards
and
be
left
alone
besides
taffy
as
simple
as
a
little
child
himself
and
could
fool
any
one
and
would
if
he
could
not
even
a
parson
but
if
any
one
tries
to
fool
my
eyes
do
he
cut
up
rough
and
call
names
and
kick
up
a
shindy
and
even
knock
people
down
that
the
worst
of
fellows
like
taffy
they
too
good
for
this
world
and
too
solemn
they
impossible
and
lack
all
sense
of
humor
in
point
of
fact
taffy
a
poor
fellow
puis
voilà
i
not
simple
worse
luck
and
i
ca
knock
people
down
i
only
wish
i
could
i
can
only
paint
them
and
not
even
they
really
are
good
old
taffy
faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
oh
happy
happy
thought
i
be
brave
and
win
i
ca
knock
people
down
or
do
doughty
deeds
but
i
be
brave
in
my
own
little
way
the
only
way
i
can
i
simply
lie
through
thick
and
thin
i
must
i
will
nobody
need
ever
be
a
bit
the
wiser
i
can
do
more
good
by
lying
than
by
telling
the
truth
and
make
more
deserving
people
happy
including
myself
and
the
sweetest
girl
alive
the
end
shall
justify
the
means
that
my
excuse
my
only
excuse
and
this
lie
of
mine
is
on
so
stupendous
a
scale
that
it
will
have
to
last
me
for
life
it
my
only
one
but
its
name
is
and
i
never
tell
another
as
long
as
i
live
and
now
that
i
know
what
temptation
really
is
i
never
think
any
harm
of
any
parson
any
more
never
never
never
so
the
little
man
went
on
as
if
he
knew
all
about
it
had
found
it
all
out
for
himself
and
nobody
else
had
ever
found
it
out
before
and
i
am
not
responsible
for
his
ways
of
thinking
which
are
not
necessarily
my
own
it
must
be
remembered
in
extenuation
that
he
was
very
young
and
not
very
wise
no
philosopher
no
scholar
just
a
painter
of
lovely
pictures
only
that
and
nothing
more
also
that
he
was
reading
darwin
immortal
book
for
the
third
time
and
it
was
a
little
too
strong
for
him
also
that
all
this
happened
in
the
early
sixties
long
ere
religion
had
made
up
her
mind
to
meet
science
and
hobnob
and
kiss
and
be
friends
alas
before
such
a
lying
down
of
the
lion
and
the
lamb
can
ever
come
to
pass
religion
will
have
to
perform
a
larger
share
of
the
journey
than
half
i
fear
then
still
carried
away
by
the
flood
of
his
own
eloquence
for
he
had
never
had
such
an
innings
as
this
no
such
a
listener
he
again
apostrophized
the
dog
tray
who
had
been
growing
somewhat
inattentive
like
the
reader
perhaps
in
language
more
beautiful
than
ever
oh
to
be
like
you
tray
and
secrete
love
and
from
morn
till
night
from
night
till
morning
like
saliva
without
effort
with
never
a
moment
cessation
of
flow
even
in
disgrace
and
humiliation
how
much
better
to
love
than
to
be
loved
to
love
as
you
do
my
tray
so
warmly
so
easily
so
unremittingly
to
forgive
all
wrongs
and
neglect
and
injustice
so
quickly
and
so
well
and
forget
a
kindness
never
lucky
dog
that
you
are
could
i
feel
as
i
have
felt
or
be
as
i
have
been
or
weep
as
i
could
once
have
wept
many
a
vanished
scene
as
springs
in
deserts
found
seem
sweet
all
brackish
tho
they
be
so
this
withered
waste
of
life
those
tears
would
flow
to
me
what
do
you
think
of
those
lines
tray
i
them
because
my
mother
taught
them
to
me
when
i
was
about
your
age
six
years
old
or
seven
and
before
the
bard
who
wrote
them
had
fallen
like
lucifer
son
of
the
morning
have
you
ever
heard
of
lord
byron
tray
he
too
like
ulysses
loved
a
dog
and
many
people
think
that
about
the
best
there
is
to
be
said
of
him
nowadays
poor
humpty
dumpty
such
a
swell
as
he
once
was
all
the
king
horses
nor
all
the
here
tray
jumped
up
suddenly
and
bolted
he
saw
some
one
else
he
was
fond
of
and
ran
to
meet
him
it
was
the
vicar
coming
out
of
his
vicarage
a
very
vicar
fresh
clean
alert
well
tanned
by
sun
and
wind
and
weather
a
youngish
vicar
still
tall
stout
gentlemanlike
shrewd
kindly
wordly
a
trifle
pompous
and
authoritative
more
than
a
trifle
not
much
given
to
abstract
speculation
and
thinking
fifty
times
more
of
any
sporting
and
orthodox
young
country
squire
and
and
than
of
all
the
painters
in
christendom
greeks
joined
greeks
then
was
the
tug
of
war
thought
little
billee
and
he
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
alice
father
had
never
loomed
so
big
and
impressive
before
or
so
distressingly
nice
to
look
at
welcome
my
apelles
to
your
ain
countree
which
is
growing
quite
proud
of
you
i
declare
young
lord
archie
waring
was
saying
only
last
night
that
he
wished
he
had
half
your
talent
he
about
painting
you
know
and
actually
wants
to
be
a
painter
himself
the
poor
dear
old
marquis
is
quite
sore
about
it
with
this
happy
exordium
the
parson
stopped
and
shook
hands
and
they
both
stood
for
a
while
looking
seaward
the
parson
said
the
usual
things
about
the
sea
its
blueness
its
grayness
its
greenness
its
beauty
its
sadness
its
treachery
shall
put
forth
on
thee
unfathomable
sea
who
indeed
answered
little
billee
quite
agreeing
i
vote
do
at
all
events
so
they
turned
inland
the
parson
said
the
usual
things
about
the
land
from
the
point
of
view
and
the
talk
began
to
flow
quite
pleasantly
with
quoting
of
the
usual
poets
and
capping
of
quotations
in
the
usual
way
for
they
had
known
each
other
many
years
both
here
and
in
london
indeed
the
vicar
had
once
been
little
billee
tutor
and
thus
amicably
they
entered
a
small
wooded
hollow
then
the
vicar
turning
of
a
sudden
his
full
blue
gaze
on
the
painter
asked
sternly
what
book
that
you
got
in
your
hand
willie
a
a
it
the
of
by
charles
darwin
i
very
of
it
i
reading
it
for
the
third
time
it
very
it
for
things
you
know
then
after
a
pause
and
still
more
sternly
what
place
of
worship
do
you
most
attend
in
london
especially
of
an
evening
william
then
stammered
little
billee
all
forsaking
him
i
attend
any
place
of
worship
at
all
morning
afternoon
or
evening
i
long
given
up
going
to
church
altogether
i
can
only
be
frank
with
you
i
tell
you
why
and
as
they
walked
along
the
talk
drifted
on
to
very
momentous
subjects
indeed
and
led
unfortunately
to
a
serious
falling
out
for
which
probably
both
were
to
blame
and
closed
in
a
distressful
way
at
the
other
end
of
the
little
wooded
hollow
a
way
most
sudden
and
unexpected
and
quite
grievous
to
relate
when
they
emerged
into
the
open
the
parson
was
quite
white
and
the
painter
crimson
sir
said
the
parson
squaring
himself
up
to
more
than
his
full
height
and
breadth
and
dignity
his
face
big
with
righteous
wrath
his
voice
full
of
strong
menace
sir
you
you
a
you
a
sir
a
you
trying
to
me
of
my
never
you
dare
to
darken
again
sir
said
little
billee
with
a
bow
if
it
comes
to
calling
names
you
you
a
no
you
alice
father
and
whatever
else
you
are
besides
i
another
for
trying
to
be
honest
with
a
parson
so
to
you
and
each
walked
off
in
an
opposite
direction
stiff
as
pokers
and
tray
stood
between
looking
first
at
one
receding
figure
then
at
the
other
disconsolate
illustration
a
sir
and
thus
little
billee
found
out
that
he
could
no
more
lie
than
he
could
fly
and
so
he
did
not
marry
sweet
alice
after
all
and
no
doubt
it
was
ordered
for
her
good
and
his
but
there
was
tribulation
for
many
days
in
the
house
of
bagot
and
for
many
months
in
one
tender
pure
and
pious
bosom
and
the
best
and
the
worst
of
it
all
is
that
not
very
many
years
after
the
good
vicar
more
fortunate
than
most
clergymen
who
dabble
in
stocks
and
shares
grew
suddenly
very
rich
through
a
lucky
speculation
in
irish
beer
and
suddenly
also
took
to
thinking
seriously
about
things
as
a
man
of
business
should
more
seriously
than
he
had
ever
thought
before
so
at
least
the
story
goes
in
north
devon
and
it
is
not
so
new
as
to
be
incredible
little
doubts
grew
into
big
ones
big
doubts
resolved
themselves
into
downright
negations
he
quarrelled
with
his
bishop
he
quarrelled
with
his
dean
he
even
quarrelled
with
his
poor
dear
old
marquis
who
died
before
there
was
time
to
make
it
up
again
and
finally
he
felt
it
his
duty
in
conscience
to
secede
from
a
church
which
had
become
too
narrow
to
hold
him
and
took
himself
and
his
belongings
to
london
where
at
least
he
could
breathe
but
there
he
fell
into
a
great
disquiet
for
the
long
habit
of
feeling
himself
always
of
being
looked
up
to
and
listened
to
without
contradiction
of
exercising
influence
and
authority
in
spiritual
matters
and
even
temporal
of
impressing
women
especially
with
his
commanding
presence
his
fine
sonorous
voice
his
lofty
brow
so
serious
and
smooth
his
soft
big
waving
hands
which
soon
lost
their
country
tan
all
this
had
grown
as
a
second
nature
to
him
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
a
necessity
of
his
life
so
he
rose
to
be
the
most
popular
unitarian
preacher
of
his
day
and
pretty
broad
at
that
but
his
dear
daughter
alice
she
stuck
to
the
old
faith
and
married
a
venerable
archdeacon
who
very
cleverly
clutched
at
and
caught
her
and
saved
her
for
himself
just
as
she
stood
shivering
on
the
very
brink
of
rome
and
they
were
neither
happy
nor
unhappy
together
ménage
bourgeois
ni
beau
ni
laid
ni
bon
ni
and
thus
alas
the
bond
of
religious
sympathy
that
counts
for
so
much
in
united
families
no
longer
existed
between
father
and
daughter
and
the
heart
division
divided
them

of
it

strong
enough
to
assommer

and
also
stately
and
solemn
of
aristocratic
and
romantic
appearance
and
not
too
fat
not
too
much
as
the
laird
called
it
and
also
he
does
not
dislike
a
bottle
of
wine
or
even
two
and
looks
as
if
he
had
a
history
the
laird
of
course
is
since
he
sells
his
pictures
well
and
by
the
time
we

has
already

beautifully

are
breakfasting
together
on
coffee

at
a

in
the
huge
of
an
immense
caravanserai
paved
with
asphalt
and
covered
in
at
the
top
with
a
glazed
roof
that
admits
the
sun
and
keeps
out
the
rain
and
the
air
a
magnificent
old
man
as
big
as

in

and
breeches
and
black
silk

and
a
large
gold
chain
round
his

looks
down

flight

though
to
welcome
the

arrive
in

through

smoking

looking
about
it
is
a
babel
of
tongues
the
cheerfulest
busiest
merriest
scene
in
the
world
apparently
the
costly
place
of
rendezvous
for
all
wealthy
europe
and
america
an
atmosphere
of
and
gold
already
taffy
has
recognized
and
been
recognized
by
half
a
dozen
old
of
unmistakable
military
aspect
like
himself
and
three
canny
scotsmen
have
discreetly
greeted
the
laird
and
as
for
little
billee
he
is
constantly
jumping
up
from
his
breakfast
and
running
to
this
table
or
that
drawn
by
some
irresistible
british
smile
of
surprised
and
delighted
female
recognition
what
here
how
nice
come
over
to
hear
la
svengali
i
suppose
at
the
top
of
the
marble
steps
is
a
long
terrace
with
seats
and
people
sitting
from
which
tall
glazed
doors
elaborately
carved
and
gilded
give
access
to
luxurious
lavatories
postal
and
telegraph
offices
and
all
round
and
about
are
huge
square
green
boxes
out
of
which
grow
tropical
and
exotic
evergreens
all
the
year
round
with
beautiful
names
that
i
have
forgotten
and
leaning
against
these
boxes
are
placards
announcing
what
theatrical
or
musical
entertainments
will
take
place
in
paris
that
day
or
night
and
the
biggest
of
these
placards
and
the
most
fantastically
decorated
informs
the
cosmopolite
world
that
madame
svengali
intends
to
make
her
first
appearance
in
paris
that
very
evening
at
nine
punctually
in
the
cirque
des
bashibazoucks
rue
honoré
illustration
an
atmosphere
of
and
gold
our
friends
had
only
arrived
the
previous
night
but
they
had
managed
to
secure
stalls
a
week
beforehand
no
places
were
any
longer
to
be
got
for
love
or
money
many
people
had
come
to
paris
on
purpose
to
hear
la
svengali
many
famous
musicians
from
england
and
everywhere
else
but
they
would
have
to
wait
many
days
the
fame
of
her
was
like
a
rolling
snowball
that
had
been
rolling
all
over
europe
for
the
last
two
years
wherever
there
was
snow
to
be
picked
up
in
the
shape
of
golden
ducats
their
breakfast
over
taffy
the
laird
and
little
billee
cigar
in
mouth
arm
in
arm
the
huge
taffy
in
the
middle
crossed
the
sunshiny
boulevard
into
the
shade
and
went
down
the
rue
de
la
paix
through
the
place
vendôme
and
the
rue
castiglione
to
the
rue
de
rivoli
quite
leisurely
and
with
a
tender
sensation
of
freedom
and
delight
at
almost
every
step
arrived
at
the
corner
they
finished
the
stumps
of
their
cigars
as
they
looked
at
the
show
in
the
window
then
they
went
in
and
had
taffy
a
madeleine
the
laird
a
baba
and
little
billee
a
savarin
and
each
i
regret
to
say
a
of
de
la
after
this
they
sauntered
through
the
tuileries
gardens
and
by
the
quay
to
their
favorite
pont
des
arts
and
looked
up
and
down
the
river
it
is
an
enchanting
prospect
at
any
time
and
under
any
circumstances
but
on
a
beautiful
morning
in
when
you
have
seen
it
for
five
years
and
are
still
young
and
almost
every
stock
and
stone
that
meets
your
eye
every
sound
every
scent
has
some
sweet
and
subtle
reminder
for
you
let
the
reader
have
no
fear
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
it
i
should
know
where
to
begin
nor
when
to
leave
off
not
but
what
many
changes
had
been
wrought
many
old
landmarks
were
missing
and
among
them
as
they
found
out
a
few
minutes
later
and
much
to
their
chagrin
the
good
old
morgue
they
inquired
of
a
de
la
who
told
them
that
a
new
morgue
une
bien
jolie
morgue
ma
foi
and
much
more
commodious
and
comfortable
than
the
old
one
had
been
built
beyond
notre
dame
a
little
to
the
right
messieurs
devraient
voir
ça
on
y
est
très
bien
but
notre
dame
herself
was
still
there
and
la
sainte
chapelle
and
le
pont
neuf
and
the
equestrian
statue
of
henri
iv
toujours
ça
and
as
they
gazed
and
gazed
each
framed
unto
himself
mentally
a
little
picture
of
the
thames
they
had
just
left
and
thought
of
waterloo
bridge
and
paul
and
london
but
felt
no
homesickness
whatever
no
desire
to
go
back
and
looking
down
the
river
westward
there
was
but
little
change
on
the
side
the
terraces
and
garden
of
the
hôtel
de
la
rochemartel
the
sculptured
entrance
of
which
was
in
the
rue
de
lille
still
overtopped
the
neighboring
houses
and
shaded
the
quay
with
tall
trees
whose
lightly
falling
leaves
yellowed
the
pavement
for
at
least
a
hundred
yards
of
frontage
or
backage
rather
for
this
was
but
the
rear
of
that
stately
palace
illustration
a
little
picture
of
the
thames
i
wonder
if
has
come
into
his
dukedom
yet
said
taffy
and
taffy
the
realist
taffy
the
modern
of
moderns
also
said
many
beautiful
things
about
old
historical
french
dukedoms
which
in
spite
of
their
plentifulness
were
so
much
more
picturesque
than
english
ones
and
constituted
a
far
more
poetical
and
romantic
link
with
the
past
partly
on
account
of
their
beautiful
names
amaury
de
brissac
de
roncesvaulx
de
la
was
a
generous
mouthful
why
the
very
sound
of
it
is
redolent
of
the
twelfth
century
not
even
howard
of
norfolk
can
beat
that
for
taffy
was
getting
sick
of
this
ghastly
time
of
ours
as
he
sadly
called
it
quoting
from
a
strange
and
very
beautiful
poem
called
faustine
which
had
just
appeared
in
the
and
which
our
three
enthusiasts
already
knew
by
heart
and
beginning
to
love
all
things
that
were
old
and
regal
and
rotten
and
forgotten
and
of
bad
repute
and
to
long
to
paint
them
just
as
they
really
were
ah
they
managed
these
things
better
in
france
especially
in
the
twelfth
century
and
even
the
thirteenth
said
the
laird
still
howard
of
norfolk
is
bad
at
a
pinch
de
he
continued
winking
at
little
billee
and
they
promised
themselves
that
they
would
leave
cards
on
zouzou
and
if
he
was
a
duke
invite
him
to
dinner
and
also
dodor
if
they
could
manage
to
find
him
then
along
the
quay
and
up
the
rue
de
seine
and
by
little
mystic
ways
to
the
old
studio
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
here
they
found
many
changes
a
row
of
new
houses
on
the
north
side
by
baron
haussmann
the
a
boulevard
was
being
constructed
right
through
the
place
but
the
old
house
had
been
respected
and
looking
up
they
saw
the
big
north
window
of
their
good
old
abode
blindless
and
blank
and
black
but
for
a
white
placard
in
the
middle
of
it
with
the
words
à
louer
un
atelier
et
une
chambre
à
coucher
they
entered
the
through
the
little
door
in
the
porte
cochère
and
beheld
madame
vinard
standing
on
the
step
of
her
loge
her
arms
akimbo
giving
orders
to
her
husband
who
was
sawing
logs
for
firewood
as
usual
at
that
time
of
the
year
and
telling
him
he
was
the
most
helpless
log
of
the
lot
she
gave
them
one
look
threw
up
her
arms
and
rushed
at
them
saying
ah
mon
dieu
les
trois
angliches
and
they
could
not
have
complained
of
any
lack
of
warmth
in
her
greeting
or
in
monsieur
vinard
ah
mais
quel
bonheur
de
vous
revoir
et
comme
vous
avez
bonne
mine
tous
et
monsieur

monsieur

a
envoyé
la

dernière
and
they
were
taken
into
the
loge
and
made
free
of
it
welcomed
like
prodigal
sons
a
fresh
bottle
of
brandy
was
tapped
and
did
duty
for
the
fatted
calf
it
was
an
ovation
and
made
quite
a
stir
in
the
quartier
retour
des
trois
angliches
cinq
ans
après
she
told
them
all
the
news
about
bouchardy
papelard
jules
guinot
who
was
now
in
the
ministère
de

barizel
who
had
given
up
the
arts
and
gone
into
his

business
umbrellas
durien
who
had
married
six
months
ago
and
had
a
superb
atelier
in
the
rue

and
was
coining
money
about
her
own
family
aglaë
who
was
going
to
be
married
to
the
son
of
the
charbonnier
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
canicule
un
bon
mariage
bien
solide
niniche
who
was
studying
the
piano
at
the
conservatoire
and
had
won
the
silver
medal
isidore
who
alas
had
gone
to
the
bad
perdu
par
les
femmes
un
si
joli
garçon
vous
concevez
ça
ne
lui
a
pas
porté
bonheur
par
exemple
and
yet
she
was
proud
and
said
his
father
would
never
have
had
the
pluck
à
ans
pensez
donc
and
that
good
monsieur
carrel
he
is
dead
you
know
ah
messieurs
savaient
ça
yes
he
died
at
dieppe
his
natal
town
during
the
winter
from
the
consequences
of
an
indigestion
que
he
always
had
the
stomach
so
feeble
ah
the
beautiful
interment
messieurs
five
thousand
people
in
spite
of
the
rain
car
il
pleuvait
averse
and
le
maire
and
his
adjunct
walking
behind
the
hearse
and
the
gendarmerie
and
the
douaniers
and
a
bataillon
of
the
douzième
with
their
music
and
all
the
en
grande
tenue
with
their
beautiful
brass
helmets
all
the
town
was
there
following
so
there
was
nobody
left
to
see
the
procession
go
by
beau
mon
dieu
beau
pleuré
ça
vinard
dame
oui
ma
biche
ben
it
might
have
been
monsieur
le
maire
himself
that
one
was
interring
in
person
ah
ça
voyons
vinard
not
going
to
compare
the
maire
of
dieppe
to
a
painter
like
monsieur
carrel
certainly
not
ma
biche
but
still
carrel
was
a
great
man
all
the
same
in
his
way
besides
i
was
there
nor
thou
either
as
to
that
mon
dieu
comme
il
est
idiot
ce
vinard
of
a
stupidity
to
cut
with
a
knife
why
thou
almost
be
a
mayor
thyself
sacred
imbecile
that
thou
art
and
an
animated
discussion
arose
between
husband
and
wife
as
to
the
respective
merits
of
a
country
mayor
on
one
side
and
a
famous
painter
and
member
of
the
institute
on
the
other
during
which
trois
were
left
out
in
the
cold
when
madame
vinard
had
sufficiently
routed
her
husband
which
did
not
take
very
long
she
turned
to
them
again
and
told
them
that
she
had
started
a
de
vous
verres
ça
yes
the
studio
had
been
to
let
for
three
months
would
they
like
to
see
it
here
were
the
keys
they
would
of
course
prefer
to
see
it
by
themselves
alone
je
comprends
ça
et
vous
verrez
ce
que
vous
verrez
then
they
must
come
and
drink
once
more
again
the
drop
and
inspect
her
de
so
they
went
up
all
three
and
let
themselves
into
the
old
place
where
they
had
been
so
happy
and
one
of
them
for
a
while
so
miserable
it
was
changed
indeed
bare
of
all
furniture
for
one
thing
shabby
and
unswept
with
a
pathetic
air
of
dilapidation
spoliation
desecration
and
a
musty
smell
the
window
so
dirty
you
could
hardly
see
the
new
houses
opposite
the
floor
a
disgrace
all
over
the
walls
were
caricatures
in
charcoal
and
white
chalk
with
more
or
less
incomprehensible
legends
very
vulgar
and
trivial
and
coarse
some
of
them
and
pointless
for
illustration
the
beautiful
interment
messieurs
but
among
these
touching
to
relate
they
found
under
a
square
of
that
had
been
fixed
on
the
wall
by
means
of
an
oak
frame
little
billee
old
chalk
sketch
of
left
foot
as
fresh
as
if
it
had
been
done
only
yesterday
over
it
was
written
souvenir
de
la
grande
trilby
par
b
litrebili
and
beneath
carefully
engrossed
on
imperishable
parchment
and
pasted
on
the
glass
the
following
stanzas
pauvre
trilby
la
belle
et
bonne
et
chère
je
suis

qui
voudra
quel
tendre

où
nul

taffy
drew
a
long
breath
into
his
manly
bosom
and
kept
it
there
as
he
read
this
characteristic
french
doggerel
for
so
he
chose
to
call
this
touching
little
symphony
in
and
his
huge
frame
thrilled
with
tenderness
and
pity
and
fond
remembrance
and
he
said
to
himself
letting
out
his
breath
dear
dear
trilby
ah
if
you
had
only
cared
for
would
have
let
you
give
me
up
not
for
any
one
on
earth
were
the
mate
for
illustration
pauvre
trilby
and
that
as
the
reader
has
guessed
long
ago
was
big
taffy
history
the
laird
was
also
deeply
touched
and
could
not
speak
had
he
been
in
love
with
trilby
too
had
he
ever
been
in
love
with
any
one
he
could
say
but
he
thought
of
trilby
sweetness
and
unselfishness
her
gayety
her
innocent
kissings
and
caressings
her
drollery
and
frolicsome
grace
her
way
of
filling
whatever
place
she
was
in
with
her
presence
the
charming
sight
and
the
genial
sound
of
her
and
felt
that
no
girl
no
woman
no
lady
he
had
ever
seen
yet
was
a
match
for
this
poor
waif
and
stray
this
grisette
blanchisseuse
de
fin
and
heaven
knows
what
besides
hang
it
all
he
mentally
ejaculated
i
wish
to
goodness
i
married
her
little
billee
said
nothing
either
he
felt
unhappier
than
he
had
ever
once
felt
for
five
long
years
to
think
that
he
could
gaze
on
such
a
memento
as
this
a
thing
so
strongly
personal
to
himself
with
dry
eyes
and
a
quiet
pulse
and
he
unemotionally
dispassionately
wished
himself
dead
and
buried
for
at
least
the
thousand
and
first
time
all
three
possessed
casts
of
trilby
hands
and
feet
and
photographs
of
herself
but
nothing
so
charmingly
suggestive
of
trilby
as
this
little
masterpiece
of
a
true
artist
this
happy
fluke
of
a
happy
moment
it
was
trilbyness
itself
as
the
laird
thought
and
should
not
be
suffered
to
perish
they
took
the
keys
back
to
madame
vinard
in
silence
she
said
vous
avez
vu
pas
messieurs
le
pied
de
trilby
bien
gentil
monsieur
durien
qui
a
fait
mettre
le
verre
quand
vous
êtes
partis
et
monsieur
guinot
qui
a
composé
pauvre
trilby
est
devenue
comme
elle
était
bonne
fille
hein
et
si
belle
et
comme
elle
était
vive
elle
était
vive
elle
était
vive
et
comme
elle
vous
aimait
tous
bien
et
surtout
monsieur
litrebili
pas
then
she
insisted
on
giving
them
each
another
of
ratafia
de
cassis
and
took
them
to
see
her
collection
of
across
the
yard
a
gorgeous
show
and
explained
everything
about
it
how
she
had
begun
in
quite
a
small
way
but
was
making
it
a
big
business
voyez
cette
pendule
it
is
of
the
time
of
louis
onze
who
gave
it
with
his
own
hands
to
madame
de
pompadour
i
bought
it
at
a
sale
in
combiang
said
the
laird
francs
monsieur
bien
bon
marché
une
véritable
occasion
et
je
prong
said
the
laird
meaning
i
take
it
then
she
showed
them
a
beautiful
brocade
gown
which
she
had
picked
up
at
a
bargain
at
combiang
said
the
laird
ah
ça
trois
cents
francs
monsieur
mais
je
prong
said
the
laird
et
voici
les
souliers
qui
vont
avec
et
que
je
pr
but
here
taffy
took
the
laird
by
the
arm
and
dragged
him
by
force
out
of
this
too
seductive
siren
cave
the
laird
told
her
where
to
send
his
purchases
and
with
many
expressions
of
love
and
on
both
sides
they
tore
themselves
away
from
monsieur
et
madame
vinard
the
laird
however
rushed
back
for
a
minute
and
hurriedly
whispered
to
madame
vinard
oh
er
le
piay
de
trilby
sur
le
mure
vous
savvy
avec
le
verre
et
toot
le
reste

ah
monsieur
said
madame
vinard
un
peu
difficile
vous

comme
ça
on
parlera
au
propriétaire
si
vous
voulez
et
ça
pourrait
si
en

seulement
il
fau
je
prong
said
the
laird
and
waved
his
hand
in
farewell
illustration
prong
they
went
up
the
rue
vieille
des
mauvais
ladres
and
found
that
about
twenty
yards
of
a
high
wall
had
been
pulled
down
just
at
the
bend
where
the
laird
had
seen
the
last
of
trilby
as
she
turned
round
and
kissed
her
hand
to
him
and
they
beheld
within
a
quaint
and
ancient
garden
a
gray
old
garden
with
tall
warty
trees
and
damp
green
mossy
paths
that
lost
themselves
under
the
brown
and
yellow
leaves
and
mould
and
muck
which
had
drifted
into
heaps
here
and
there
the
accumulation
of
years
a
queer
old
faded
pleasance
with
wasted
bowers
and
dilapidated
carved
stone
benches
and
discolored
marble
statues
noseless
armless
earless
fauns
and
hamadryads
and
at
the
end
of
it
in
a
state
of
utter
ruin
a
still
inhabited
little
house
with
shabby
blinds
and
and
broken
mended
with
brown
paper
a
pavillon
de
flore
that
must
have
been
quite
beautiful
a
hundred
years
ago
the
once
mysterious
of
abbés
with
light
hearts
and
lords
and
ladies
gay
patched
powdered
frivolous
and
shameless
but
oh
how
charming
to
the
imagination
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
right
through
the
ragged
lawn
where
lay
upset
in
the
long
dewy
grass
a
broken
doll
perambulator
by
a
tattered
punchinello
went
a
desecrating
track
made
by
and
hoofs
and
this
no
doubt
was
to
be
a
new
street
perhaps
as
taffy
suggested
la
rue
des
mauvais
ladres
the
street
of
the
bad
lepers
ah
taffy
sententiously
opined
the
laird
with
his
usual
wink
at
little
billee
i
no
doubt
the
lepers
were
the
best
bad
as
they
were
i
quite
of
it
said
taffy
with
sad
and
sober
conviction
and
a
sigh
i
only
wish
i
had
a
chance
of
painting
one
just
as
he
really
was
how
often
they
had
speculated
on
what
lay
hidden
behind
that
lofty
old
brick
wall
and
now
this
melancholy
little
peep
into
the
once
festive
past
the
touching
sight
of
this
odd
old
abode
of
heaven
knows
what
present
grief
and
desolation
which
a
few
strokes
of
the
pickaxe
had
laid
bare
seemed
to
chime
in
with
their
own
gray
mood
that
had
been
so
bright
and
sunny
an
hour
ago
and
they
went
on
their
way
quite
dejectedly
for
a
stroll
through
the
luxembourg
gallery
and
gardens
the
same
people
seemed
to
be
still
copying
the
same
pictures
in
the
long
quiet
genial
room
so
pleasantly
smelling
of
rosa
bonheur
labourage
nivernais
hébert
malaria
couture
decadent
romans
and
in
the
formal
dusty
gardens
were
the
same
pioupious
and
zouzous
still
walking
with
the
same
nounous
or
sitting
by
their
sides
on
benches
by
formal
ponds
with
gold
and
silver
fish
in
them
and
just
the
same
old
couples
petting
the
same
toutous
and
loulous
a
a
pioupiou
tourlourou
a
private
soldier
of
the
line
zouzou
a
zouave
nounou
a
with
a
pretty
ribboned
cap
and
long
streamers
toutou
a
nondescript
french
lapdog
of
no
breed
known
to
englishmen
a
regular
little
beast
loulou
a
pomeranian
dog
not
much
better
then
they
thought
they
would
go
and
lunch
at
le
père
trin
the
restaurant
de
la
couronne
in
the
rue
du
luxembourg
for
the
sake
of
auld
lang
syne
but
when
they
got
there
the
fumes
of
that
humble
refectory
which
had
once
seemed
not
unappetizing
turned
their
stomachs
so
they
contented
themselves
with
warmly
greeting
le
père
trin
who
was
quite
overjoyed
to
see
them
again
and
anxious
to
turn
the
whole
establishment
that
he
might
entertain
such
guests
as
they
deserved
then
the
laird
suggested
an
omelet
at
the
café
de
but
taffy
said
in
his
masterful
way
damn
the
café
de
and
hailing
a
little
open
fly
they
drove
to
ledoyen
or
some
such
place
in
the
champs
élysées
where
they
feasted
as
became
three
prosperous
britons
out
for
a
holiday
in
paris
three
irresponsible
musketeers
lords
of
themselves
and
lutetia
possidentes
and
afterwards
had
themselves
driven
in
an
open
carriage
and
pair
through
the
bois
de
boulogne
to
the
fête
de
st
cloud
or
what
still
remained
of
it
for
it
lasts
six
weeks
the
scene
of
so
many
of
dodor
and
zouzou
exploits
in
past
years
and
found
it
more
amusing
than
the
luxembourg
gardens
the
lively
and
irrepressible
spirit
of
dodor
seemed
to
pervade
it
still
but
it
does
want
the
presence
of
a
dodor
to
make
the
sons
of
the
gallic
people
and
its
neatly
shod
daughters
delightful
to
watch
as
they
take
their
pleasure
and
the
laird
thinking
perhaps
of
hampstead
heath
on
an
easter
monday
must
not
be
blamed
for
once
more
quoting
his
favorite
phrase
the
pretty
little
phrase
with
which
the
most
humorous
and
least
exemplary
of
british
parsons
began
his
famous
journey
to
france
when
they
came
back
to
the
hotel
to
dress
and
dine
the
laird
found
he
wanted
a
pair
of
white
gloves
for
the
concert
oon
pair
de
gong
blong
as
he
called
it
and
they
walked
along
the
boulevards
till
they
came
to
a
haberdasher
shop
of
very
good
and
prosperous
appearance
and
going
in
were
received
graciously
by
the
patron
a
portly
little
bourgeois
who
waved
them
to
a
tall
and
aristocratic
and
very
well
dressed
young
commis
behind
the
counter
saying
une
paire
de
gants
blancs
pour
monsieur
and
what
was
the
surprise
of
our
three
friends
in
recognizing
dodor
the
gay
dodor
dodor
quite
unembarrassed
by
his
position
was
exuberant
in
his
delight
at
seeing
them
again
and
introduced
them
to
the
patron
and
his
wife
and
daughter
monsieur
madame
and
mademoiselle
passefil
and
it
soon
became
pretty
evident
that
in
spite
of
his
humble
employment
in
that
house
he
was
a
great
favorite
in
that
family
and
especially
with
mademoiselle
illustration
pair
de
gong
blong
indeed
monsieur
passefil
invited
our
three
heroes
to
stay
and
dine
then
and
there
but
they
compromised
matters
by
asking
dodor
to
come
and
dine
with
at
the
hotel
and
he
accepted
with
alacrity
thanks
to
dodor
the
dinner
was
a
very
lively
one
and
they
soon
forgot
the
regretful
impressions
of
the
day
they
learned
that
he
had
got
a
penny
in
the
world
and
had
left
the
army
and
had
for
two
years
kept
the
books
at
le
père
passefil
and
served
his
customers
and
won
his
good
opinion
and
his
wife
and
especially
his
daughter
and
that
soon
he
was
to
be
not
only
his
employer
partner
but
his
and
that
in
spite
of
his
impecuniosity
he
had
managed
to
impress
them
with
the
fact
that
in
marrying
a
rigolot
de
lafarce
she
was
making
a
very
splendid
match
indeed
his
the
honorable
jack
reeve
had
long
cut
him
for
a
bad
lot
but
his
sister
after
a
while
had
made
up
her
mind
that
to
marry
mlle
passefil
was
the
worst
he
could
do
at
all
events
it
would
keep
him
out
of
england
and
was
a
comfort
and
passing
through
paris
she
had
actually
called
on
the
passefil
family
and
they
had
fallen
prostrate
before
such
splendor
and
no
wonder
for
jack
reeve
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
elegant
and
fashionable
women
in
london
the
smartest
of
the
smart
and
how
about
asked
little
billee
ah
old
gontran
i
do
see
much
of
him
we
no
longer
quite
move
in
the
same
circles
you
know
not
that
he
proud
or
me
either
but
a
in
the
guides
an
officer
besides
his
dead
and
he
the
duc
de
la
rochemartel
and
a
special
pet
of
the
empress
he
makes
her
laugh
more
than
anybody
he
looking
out
for
the
biggest
heiress
he
can
find
and
he
pretty
safe
to
catch
her
with
such
a

in

they
say
he
caught
her
already
miss
lavinia
hunks
of
chicago
twenty
million
dollars
at
least
so
the
says
then
he
gave
them
news
of
other
old
friends
and
they
did
not
part
till
it
was
time
for
them
to
go
to
the
cirque
des
bashibazoucks
and
after
they
had
arranged
to
dine
with
his
future
family
on
the
following
day
in
the
rue
honoré
was
a
long
double
file
of
cabs
and
carriages
slowly
moving
along
to
the
portals
of
that
huge
hall
le
cirque
des
bashibazoucks
is
it
there
still
i
wonder
i
do
mind
betting
not
just
at
this
period
of
the
second
empire
there
was
a
mania
for
demolition
and
remolition
if
there
is
such
a
word
and
i
have
no
doubt
my
parisian
readers
would
search
the
rue
honoré
for
the
salle
des
bashibazoucks
in
vain
our
friends
were
shown
to
their
stalls
and
looked
round
in
surprise
this
was
before
the
days
of
the
albert
hall
and
they
had
never
been
in
such
a
big
place
of
the
kind
before
or
one
so
regal
in
aspect
so
gorgeously
imperial
with
white
and
gold
and
crimson
velvet
so
dazzling
with
light
so
crammed
with
people
from
floor
to
roof
and
cramming
itself
still
a
platform
carpeted
with
crimson
cloth
had
been
erected
in
front
of
the
gates
where
the
horses
had
once
used
to
come
in
and
their
fair
riders
and
the
two
jolly
english
clowns
and
the
beautiful
nobleman
with
the
long
and
brass
buttons
and
soft
high
boots
and
whip
la
chambrière
in
front
of
this
was
a
lower
stand
for
the
orchestra
the
circus
itself
was
filled
with
stalls
stalles
a
pair
of
crimson
curtains
hid
the
entrance
to
the
platform
at
the
back
and
by
each
of
these
stood
a
small
page
ready
to
draw
it
aside
and
admit
the
diva
the
entrance
to
the
orchestra
was
by
a
small
door
under
the
platform
and
some
thirty
or
forty
chairs
and
grouped
around
the
conductor
estrade
were
waiting
for
the
band
little
billee
looked
round
and
recognized
many
countrymen
and
countrywomen
of
his
own
many
great
musical
celebrities
especially
whom
he
had
often
met
in
london
tiers
upon
tiers
of
people
rose
up
all
round
in
a
widening
circle
and
lost
themselves
in
a
dazy
mist
of
light
at
the
top
it
was
like
a
picture
by
martin
in
the
imperial
box
were
the
english
ambassador
and
his
family
with
an
august
british
personage
sitting
in
the
middle
in
front
his
broad
blue
ribbon
across
his
breast
and
his
to
his
royal
eyes
little
billee
had
never
felt
so
excited
so
exhilarated
by
such
a
show
before
nor
so
full
of
eager
anticipation
he
looked
at
his
programme
and
saw
that
the
hungarian
band
the
first
that
had
yet
appeared
in
western
europe
i
believe
would
play
an
overture
of
gypsy
dances
then
madame
svengali
would
sing
un
air
connu
sans
accompagnement
and
afterwards
other
airs
including
the
nussbaum
of
schumann
for
the
first
time
in
paris
it
seemed
then
a
rest
of
ten
minutes
then
more
csárdás
then
the
diva
would
sing
malbrouck
guerre
of
all
things
in
the
world
and
finish
up
with
un
impromptu
de
chopin
sans
paroles
truly
a
somewhat
incongruous
bill
of
fare
illustration
gecko
close
on
the
stroke
of
nine
the
musicians
came
in
and
took
their
seats
they
were
dressed
in
the
foreign
hussar
uniform
that
has
now
become
so
familiar
the
first
violin
had
scarcely
sat
down
before
friends
recognized
in
him
their
old
friend
gecko
just
as
the
clock
struck
svengali
in
irreproachable
evening
dress
tall
and
stout
and
quite
splendid
in
appearance
notwithstanding
his
long
black
mane
which
had
been
curled
took
his
place
at
his
desk
our
friends
would
have
known
him
at
a
glance
in
spite
of
the
wonderful
alteration
time
and
prosperity
had
wrought
in
his
outward
man
he
bowed
right
and
left
to
the
thunderous
applause
that
greeted
him
gave
his
three
little
and
the
lovely
music
began
at
once
we
have
grown
accustomed
to
strains
of
this
kind
during
the
last
twenty
years
but
they
were
new
then
and
their
strange
seduction
was
a
surprise
as
well
as
an
enchantment
besides
no
such
band
as
svengali
had
ever
been
heard
and
in
listening
to
this
overture
the
immense
crowd
almost
forgot
that
it
was
a
mere
preparation
for
a
great
musical
event
and
tried
to
encore
it
but
svengali
merely
turned
round
and
bowed
there
were
to
be
no
encores
that
night
then
a
moment
of
silence
and
breathless
suspense
curiosity
on
tiptoe
then
the
two
little
each
drew
a
silken
rope
and
the
curtains
parted
and
looped
themselves
up
on
each
side
symmetrically
and
a
tall
female
figure
appeared
clad
in
what
seemed
like
a
classical
dress
of
cloth
of
gold
embroidered
with
garnets
and
beetles
wings
her
snowy
arms
and
shoulders
bare
a
gold
coronet
of
stars
on
her
head
her
thick
light
brown
hair
tied
behind
and
flowing
all
down
her
back
to
nearly
her
knees
like
those
ladies
in
shops
who
sit
with
their
backs
to
the
windows
to
advertise
the
merits
of
some
particular
she
walked
slowly
down
to
the
front
her
hands
hanging
at
her
sides
in
quite
a
simple
fashion
and
made
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
and
body
towards
the
imperial
box
and
then
to
right
and
left
her
lips
and
cheeks
were
rouged
her
dark
level
eyebrows
nearly
met
at
the
bridge
of
her
short
high
nose
through
her
parted
lips
you
could
see
her
large
glistening
white
teeth
her
gray
eyes
looked
straight
at
svengali
her
face
was
thin
and
had
a
rather
haggard
expression
in
spite
of
its
artificial
freshness
but
its
contour
was
divine
and
its
character
so
tender
so
humble
so
touchingly
simple
and
sweet
that
one
melted
at
the
sight
of
her
no
such
magnificent
or
seductive
apparition
has
ever
been
seen
before
or
since
on
any
stage
or
platform
not
even
miss
ellen
terry
as
the
priestess
of
artemis
in
the
late
laureate
play
the
cup
the
house
rose
at
her
as
she
came
down
to
the
front
and
she
bowed
again
to
right
and
left
and
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
quite
simply
and
with
a
most
winning
natural
gesture
an
adorable
gaucherie
like
a
graceful
and
unconscious
quite
innocent
of
stage
deportment
was
trilby
trilby
the
who
could
sing
one
single
note
in
tune
trilby
who
could
tell
a
c
from
an
f
what
was
going
to
happen
our
three
friends
were
almost
turned
to
stone
in
the
immensity
of
their
surprise
yet
the
big
taffy
was
trembling
all
over
the
laird
jaw
had
all
but
fallen
on
to
his
chest
little
billee
was
staring
staring
his
eyes
almost
out
of
his
head
there
was
something
to
them
so
strange
and
uncanny
about
it
all
so
oppressive
so
anxious
so
momentous
the
applause
had
at
last
subsided
trilby
stood
with
her
hands
behind
her
one
foot
the
left
one
on
a
little
stool
that
had
been
left
there
on
purpose
her
lips
parted
her
eyes
on
svengali
ready
to
begin
he
gave
his
three
beats
and
the
band
struck
a
chord
then
at
another
beat
from
him
but
in
her
direction
she
began
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
effort
without
any
accompaniment
whatever
he
still
beating
time
conducting
her
in
fact
just
as
if
she
had
been
an
orchestra

this
was
the
absurd
old
nursery
rhyme
with
which
la
svengali
chose
to
make
her
début
before
the
most
critical
audience
in
the
world
she
sang
it
three
times
over
the
same
verse
there
is
but
one
the
first
time
she
sang
it
without
any
expression
whatever
not
the
slightest
just
the
words
and
the
tune
in
the
middle
of
her
voice
and
not
loud
at
all
just
as
a
child
sings
who
is
thinking
of
something
else
or
just
as
a
young
french
mother
sings
who
is
darning
socks
by
a
cradle
and
rocking
her
baby
to
sleep
with
her
foot
but
her
voice
was
so
immense
in
its
softness
richness
freshness
that
it
seemed
to
be
pouring
itself
out
from
all
round
its
intonation
absolutely
mathematically
pure
one
felt
it
to
be
not
only
faultless
but
infallible
and
the
seduction
the
novelty
of
it
the
strangely
sympathetic
quality
how
can
one
describe
the
quality
of
a
peach
or
a
nectarine
to
those
who
have
only
known
apples
until
la
svengali
appeared
the

had
only

apples

that
can

she
had
spread
a
pair
of
large
white
wings
and
gracefully
fluttered
up
to
the
roof
and
perched
upon
the
chandelier
she
could
not
have
produced
a
greater
sensation
the
like
of
that
voice
has
never
been
heard
nor
ever
will
be
again
a

archangel
might
sing

princess
out
of

had
already
dropped
his
face
into
his
hands
and
hid
his
eyes
in
his
a
big
tear
had
fallen
on
to

whisker
the
laird
was
trying
hard
to
keep
his
tears
back
she
sang
the
verse
a
second
time
with
but
little
added
expression
and
no
louder
but
with
a
sort
of
breathy
widening
of
her
voice
that
made
it
like
a
broad
heavenly
smile
of
universal
motherhood
turned
into
sound
one
felt
all
the
genial
gayety
and
grace
and
impishness
of
pierrot
and
columbine
idealized
into
frolicsome
beauty
and
holy
innocence
as
though
they
were
performing
for
the
saints
in
paradise
a
baby
columbine
with
a
cherub
for
clown
the
dream
of
it
all
came
over
you
for
a
second
or
two
a
revelation
of
some
impossible
golden
age
priceless
never
to
be
forgotten
how
on
earth
did
she
do
it
little
billee
had
lost
all
control
over
himself
and
was
shaking
with
his
suppressed
sobs
little
billee
who
had
shed
a
single
tear
for
five
long
years
half
the
people
in
the
house
were
in
tears
but
tears
of
sheer
delight
of
delicate
inner
laughter
then
she
came
back
to
earth
and
saddened
and
veiled
and
darkened
her
voice
as
she
sang
the
verse
for
the
third
time
and
it
was
a
great
and
sombre
tragedy
too
deep
for
any
more
tears
and
somehow
or
other
poor
columbine
forlorn
and
betrayed
and
dying
out
in
the
cold
at
midnight
sinking
down
to
hell
perhaps
was
making
her
last
frantic
appeal
it
was
no
longer
pierrot
and
columbine
it
was
marguerite
it
was
faust
it
was
the
most
terrible
and
pathetic
of
all
possible
human
tragedies
but
expressed
with
no
dramatic
or
histrionic
exaggeration
of
any
sort
by
mere
tone
slight
subtle
changes
in
the
quality
of
the
sound
too
quick
and
elusive
to
be
taken
count
of
but
to
be
felt
with
oh
what
poignant
sympathy
when
the
song
was
over
the
applause
did
not
come
immediately
and
she
waited
with
her
kind
wide
smile
as
if
she
were
well
accustomed
to
wait
like
this
and
then
the
storm
began
and
grew
and
spread
and
rattled

echoed

and
down
came
the
bouquets
which
the
little
picked
up
and

bowed
to

in
her
simple
fashion
it
was
her
usual
triumph
it
had
never
failed

did
applaud
he
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hands
his
shoulders
still
heaving
he
believed
himself
to
be
fast
asleep
and
in
a
dream
and
was
trying
his
utmost
not
to
wake
for
a
great
happiness
was
his
it
was
one
of
those
nights
to
be
marked
with
a
white
stone
as
the
first
bars
of
the
song
came
pouring
out
of
her
parted
lips
whose
shape
he
so
well
remembered
and
her
dovelike
eyes
looked
straight
over
svengali
head
straight
in
his
own
direction
nay
him
something
melted
in
his
brain
and
all
his
power
of
loving
came
back
with
a
rush
it
was
like
the
sudden
curing
of
a
deafness

has
been

years

sat
up
again
in

of

singing
of
the
nussbaum
and
saw
her
and
saw
the
laird
sitting
by
him
and
taffy
their
eyes
riveted
on
trilby
and
knew
for
certain
that
it
was
dream
this
time
and
his
joy
was
almost
a
pain

she
sang
the
nussbaum
to
its
heavenly
accompaniment
as
simply
as
she
had
sung
the
previous
song
every
separate
note
was
a
highly
finished
gem
of
sound
linked
to
the
next
by
a
magic
bond
you
did
not
require
to
be
a
lover
of
music
to
fall
beneath
the
spell
of
such
a
voice
as
that
the
mere
melodic
phrase
had
all
but
ceased
to
matter
her
phrasing
consummate
as
it
was
was
as
simple
as
a
child
it
was
as
if
she
said
see
what
does
the
composer
count
for
here
is
about
as
beautiful
a
song
as
was
ever
written
with
beautiful
words
to
match

words
have
been
made

you
by

for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
was
rewarded
with
a
dukedom
and
wealth
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
and
indeed
here
was
this
immense
audience
made
up
of
the
most
cynically
critical
people
in
the
world
and
the
most
assisting
with
rapt
ears
and

at
the

spectacle

probably
drinking

and
smoking
long
porcelain
pipes
and
talking
politics

business
and
cracking
innocent

jokes
with

breath
lest
they
should
disturb
her

dream
of

and
all
as
though

were

and
her
people
olympian
gods
and

and
such
indeed

were
when

sang
of
them
after
this
when
the
long
frantic
applause
had
subsided
she
made
a
gracious
bow
to
the

never
left
her

it

his
old
cosmic
vision
of
the
beauty
and
sadness
of
things
the
very
heart
of
them
and
their
pathetic
evanescence
came
back
with
a
tenfold
clearness
that
heavenly
glimpse
beyond
the
veil
and
with
it
a
crushing
sense
of
his
own
infinitesimal
significance
by
the
side
of
this
glorious

of
whom
had
been
his
friend
and
the
other
his
love
a
love
who
had
offered
to
be
his
humble
mistress
and
slave
not
feeling
herself
good
enough
to
be
his
wife
it
made
him
sick
and
faint
to
remember
and
filled
him
with
hot
shame
and
then
and
there
his
love
for
trilby
became
as
that
of
a
dog
for
its
master
she
sang
once
more
chanson
de
printemps
by
gounod
who
was
present
and
seemed
very
hysterical
and
the
first
part
of
the
concert
was
over
and
people
had
time
to
draw
breath
and
talk
over
this
new
wonder
this
revelation
of
what
the
human
voice
could
achieve
and
an
immense
hum
filled
the
hall
astonishment
enthusiasm
ecstatic
delight
but
our
three
friends
found
little
to
say
for
what
felt
there
were
as
yet
no
words
illustration
malbrouck
guerre
taffy
and
the
laird
looked
at
little
billee
who
seemed
to
be
looking
inward
at
some
transcendent
dream
of
his
own
with
red
eyes
and
his
face
all
pale
and
drawn
and
his
nose
very
pink
and
rather
thicker
than
usual
and
the
dream
appeared
to
be
out
of
the
common
blissful
though
his
eyes
were
swimming
still
for
his
smile
was
almost
idiotic
in
its
rapture
the
second
part
of
the
concert
was
still
shorter
than
the
first
and
created
if
possible
a
wilder
enthusiasm
trilby
only
sang
twice
her
first
song
was
malbrouck
guerre
she
began
it
quite
lightly
and
merrily
like
a
jolly
march
in
the
middle
of
her
voice
which
had
not
as
yet
revealed
any
exceptional
compass
or
range
people
laughed
quite
frankly
at
the
first
verse
malbrouck
guerre
mironton
mirontaine
malbrouck
guerre
ne
sais
quand
reviendra
ne
sais
quand

ne
sais
quand

the
was
the
very
essence
of
high
martial
resolve
and
heroic
one
would
have
led
a
forlorn
hope
after
hearing
it
once
il

people
still
laughed
though
the
betrayed
an
uncomfortable
sense
of
the
dawning
of
doubts
and
fears
vague
forebodings

and
here
especially
in
the
a
note
of
anxiety
revealed
itself
so
poignant
so
acutely
natural
and
human
that
it
became
a
personal
anxiety
of
one
own
causing
the
heart
to
beat
and
one
breath
was
short

and
here
little
billee
begins
to
weep
again
and
so
does
everybody
else
the
is
an
agonized
wail
of
suspense
poor
bereaved
duchess
poor
sarah
jennings
did
it
all
announce
itself
to
you
just
like
that
all
this
while
the
accompaniment
had
been
quite
simple
just
a
few
obvious
ordinary
chords
but
now
quite
suddenly
without
a
single
modulation
or
note
of
warning
down
goes
the
tune
a
full
major
third
from
e
to
c
into
the
graver
depths
of
trilby
great
contralto
so
solemn
and
ominous
that
there
is
no
more
weeping
but
the
flesh
creeps
the
accompaniment
slows
and
elaborates
itself
the
march
becomes
a
funeral
march
with
muted
strings
and
quite
slowly
aux

aux

richer
and
richer
grows
the
accompaniment
the
becomes
a
dirge

here
the
of
a
big
bell
seems
to
mingle
with
the
score
and
very
slowly
and
so
impressively
that
the
news
will
ring
forever
in
the
ears
and
hearts
of
those
who
hear
it
from

and
thus
it
ends
quite
abruptly
and
this
tragedy
this
great
historical
epic
in
two
dozen
lines
at
which
some
five
or
six
thousand
gay
french
people
are
sniffling
and
mopping
their
eyes
like
so
many
niobes
is
just
a
common
old
french

a
mere
nursery

like
little
to
the
tune

after
a
second
or

of
silence
oppressive
and
impressive
as
that
which
occurs
at
a
burial
when
the
handful
of

is
being
dropped
on
the
the
audience
bursts
once
more
into
madness
and

accepts
no

has
to
bow
for
nearly
five
minutes
standing
amid
a
sea

then
comes
her
great
and
final
performance
the
orchestra
swiftly
plays
the
first
four
bars
of
the
bass
in
chopin
impromptu
a
flat
and
suddenly
without
words
as
a
light
nymph
catching
the
whirl
of
a
double
la

breaks
in
and
vocalizes
that
astounding
piece
of
music
that
so
few
pianists
can
even
play
but
no
pianist
has
ever
played
it
like
this
no
piano
has
ever
given
out
such
notes
as
these
every
single
phrase
is
a
string
of
perfect
gems
of
purest
ray
serene
strung
together
on
a
loose
golden
thread
the
higher
and
shriller
she
sings
the
sweeter
it
is
higher
and
shriller
than
any
woman
had
ever
sung
before
waves
of
sweet
and
tender
laughter
the
very
heart
and
essence
of
innocent
girlhood
alive
to
all
that
is
simple
and
joyous
and
elementary
in
nature
the
freshness
of
the
morning
the
ripple
of
the
stream
the
click
of
the
mill
the
lisp
of
wind
in
the
trees
the
song
of
the
lark
in
the
cloudless
sky
the
sun
and
the
dew
the
scent
of
early
flowers
and
summer
woods
and
meadows
the
sight
of
birds
and
bees
and
butterflies
and
frolicsome
young
animals
at
play
all
the
sights
and
scents
and
sounds
that
are
the
birthright
of
happy
children
happy
savages
in
favored
climes
things
within
the
remembrance
and
the
reach
of
most
of
us
all
this
the
memory
and
the
feel
of
it
are
in
voice
as
she
warbles
that
long
smooth
lilting
dancing
laugh
that
wondrous
song
without
words
and
those
who
hear
feel
it
all
and
remember
it
with
her
it
is
irresistible
it
forces
itself
on
you
no
words
no
pictures
could
ever
do
the
like
so
that
the
tears
that
are
shed
out
of
all
these
many
french
eyes
are
tears
of
pure
unmixed
delight
in
happy
reminiscence
chopin
it
is
true
may
have
meant
something
quite
different
a
perhaps
with
orchids
and
arum
lilies
and
tuberoses
and
hydrangeas
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
illustration

then
comes
the
slow
movement
the
sudden
adagio
with
its
capricious
ornaments
the
waking
of
the
virgin
heart
the
stirring
of
the
sap
the
dawn
of
love
its
doubts
and
fears
and
questionings
and
the
mellow
powerful
deep
chest
notes
are
like
the
pealing
of
great
golden
bells
with
a
light
little
pearl
shower
tinkling
round
drops
from
the
upper
fringe
of
her
grand
voice
as
she
shakes
it
then
back
again
the

distinct
as

drowning
the

quite
ineffable
a
joy
there
is
no
telling
a
clear
purling
crystal
stream
that
gurgles
and
foams
and
bubbles
along
over
sunlit
stones
a
wonder
a
world
delight
and
there
is
not
a
sign
of

of
difficulty
overcome
all
through

her
broad
angelic
smile
her
lips
well
parted
her
big
white
teeth
glistening
as
she
gently
jerks
her
head
from
side
to
side
in
time
to

as
if
to
shake
the
willing
notes
out
quicker
and
higher
and
shriller
and
in
a
minute
or
two
it
is
all
over
like
the
lovely
bouquet
of
fireworks
at
the
end
of
the
show
and
she
lets
what
remains
of
it
die
out
and
away
like
the
afterglow
of
fading
bengal
fires
her
voice
receding
into
the
distance
coming
back
to
you
like
an
echo
from
all
round
from
anywhere

on
to
the
platform
by
his

and
kisses
her

and
they
both
bow
themselves
backward
through
the
curtains
which
fall
to
rise
again
and
again
and
again
on
this
astounding
pair
such
was
la
svengali
début
in
paris
it
had
lasted
little
over
an
hour
one
quarter
of
which
at
least
had
been
spent
in
plaudits
and
courtesies
the
writer
is
no
musician
alas
as
no
doubt
his
musical
readers
have
found
out
by
this
save
in
his
thraldom
to
music
of
not
too
severe
a
kind
and
laments
the
clumsiness
and
inadequacy
of
this
wild
though
somewhat
ambitious
attempt
to
recall
an
impression
received
more
than
thirty
years
ago
to
revive
the
memory
of
that
unforgettable
first
night
at
the
cirque
des
bashibazoucks
would
that
i
could
transcribe
here
berlioz
famous
series
of
twelve
articles
entitled
la
svengali
which
were
republished
from
lyre
and
are
now
out
of
print
or
théophile
gautier
elaborate
rhapsody
madame
svengali
ange
ou
femme
in
which
he
proves
that
one
need
not
have
a
musical
ear
he
had
to
be
enslaved
by
such
a
voice
as
hers
any
more
than
the
eye
for
beauty
this
he
to
fall
the
victim
of
her
celestial
form
and
face
it
is
enough
he
says
to
be
simply
human
i
forget
in
which
journal
this
eloquent
tribute
appeared
it
is
not
to
be
found
in
his
collected
works
or
the
intemperate
diatribe
by
herr
blagner
as
i
will
christen
him
on
the
tyranny
of
the
prima
donna
called
svengalismus
in
which
he
attempts
to
show
that
mere
virtuosity
carried
to
such
a
pitch
is
mere
viciosity
base
acrobatismus
of
the
vocal
chords
a
hysteric
appeal
to
morbid
gallic
sentimentalismus
and
that
this
monstrous
development
of
a
phenomenal
larynx
this
degrading
cultivation
and
practice
of
the
abnormalismus
of
a
mere
physical
peculiarity
are
death
and
destruction
to
all
true
music
since
they
place
mozart
and
beethoven
and
even
on
a
level
with
bellini
donizetti
offenbach
any
italian
any
of
the
hated
paris
pavement
and
can
make
the
highest
music
of
all
even
go
down
with
the
common
french
herd
at
the
very
first
hearing
just
as
if
it
were
some
idiotic
refrain
of
the
café
chantant
so
much
for
blagnerismus
svengalismus
but
i
fear
there
is
no
space
within
the
limits
of
this
humble
tale
for
these
masterpieces
of
technical
musical
criticism
besides
there
are
other
reasons
our
three
heroes
walked
back
to
the
boulevards
the
only
silent
ones
amid
the
throng
that
poured
through
the
rue
honoré
as
the
cirque
des
bashibazoucks
emptied
itself
of
its
audience
they
went
arm
in
arm
as
usual
but
this
time
little
billee
was
in
the
middle
he
wished
to
feel
on
each
side
of
him
the
warm
and
genial
contact
of
his
two
beloved
old
friends
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
suddenly
been
restored
to
him
after
five
long
years
of
separation
his
heart
was
overflowing
with
affection
for
them
too
full
to
speak
just
yet
overflowing
indeed
with
the
love
of
love
the
love
of
life
the
love
of
death
the
love
of
all
that
is
and
ever
was
and
ever
will
be
just
as
in
his
old
way
he
could
have
hugged
them
both
in
the
open
street
before
the
whole
world
and
the
delight
of
it
was
that
this
was
no
dream
about
that
there
was
no
mistake
he
was
himself
again
at
last
after
five
years
and
wide
awake
and
he
owed
it
all
to
trilby
and
what
did
he
feel
for
trilby
he
could
tell
yet
it
was
too
vast
as
yet
to
be
measured
and
alas
it
was
weighted
with
such
a
burden
of
sorrow
and
regret
that
he
might
well
put
off
the
thought
of
it
a
little
while
longer
and
gather
in
what
bliss
he
might
like
the
man
whose
hearing
has
been
restored
after
long
years
he
would
revel
in
the
mere
physical
delight
of
hearing
for
a
space
and
not
go
out
of
his
way
as
yet
to
listen
for
the
bad
news
that
was
already
in
the
air
and
would
come
to
roost
quite
soon
enough
taffy
and
the
laird
were
silent
also
trilby
voice
was
still
in
their
ears
and
hearts
her
image
in
their
eyes
and
utter
bewilderment
still
oppressed
them
and
kept
them
dumb
it
was
a
warm
and
balmy
night
almost
like
and
they
stopped
at
the
first
café
they
met
on
the
boulevard
de
la
madeleine
and
ordered
bocks
of
beer
and
sat
at
a
little
table
on
the
pavement
the
only
one
unoccupied
for
the
café
was
already
crowded
the
hum
of
lively
talk
was
great
and
la
svengali
was
in
every
mouth
the
laird
was
the
first
to
speak
he
emptied
his
bock
at
a
draught
and
called
for
another
and
lit
a
cigar
and
said
i
do
believe
it
was
trilby
after
all
it
was
the
first
time
her
name
had
been
mentioned
between
them
that
evening
and
for
five
years
good
heavens
said
taffy
can
you
doubt
it
oh
yes
that
was
trilby
said
little
billee
then
the
laird
proceeded
to
explain
that
putting
aside
the
impossibility
of
trilby
ever
being
taught
to
sing
in
tune
and
her
loathing
for
svengali
he
had
narrowly
scanned
her
face
through
his
and
found
that
in
spite
of
a
likeness
quite
marvellous
there
were
differences
her
face
was
narrower
and
longer
her
eyes
larger
and
their
expression
not
the
same
then
she
seemed
taller
and
stouter
and
her
shoulders
broader
and
more
drooping
and
so
forth
but
the
others
would
hear
of
it
and
voted
him
cracked
and
declared
they
even
recognized
the
peculiar
twang
of
her
old
speaking
voice
in
the
voice
she
now
sang
with
especially
when
she
sang
low
down
and
they
all
three
fell
to
discussing
the
wonders
of
her
performance
like
everybody
else
all
round
little
billee
leading
with
an
eloquence
and
a
seeming
of
technical
musical
knowledge
that
quite
impressed
them
and
made
them
feel
happy
and
at
ease
for
they
were
anxious
for
his
sake
about
the
effect
this
sudden
and
so
unexpected
sight
of
her
would
have
upon
him
after
all
that
had
passed
he
seemed
transcendently
happy
and
elate
incomprehensibly
so
in
fact
and
looked
at
them
both
with
quite
a
new
light
in
his
eyes
as
if
all
the
music
he
had
heard
had
trebled
not
only
his
joy
in
being
alive
but
his
pleasure
at
being
with
them
evidently
he
had
quite
outgrown
his
old
passion
for
her
and
that
was
a
comfort
indeed
but
little
billee
knew
better
he
knew
that
his
old
passion
for
her
had
all
come
back
and
was
so
overwhelming
and
immense
that
he
could
not
feel
it
just
yet
nor
yet
the
hideous
pangs
of
a
jealousy
so
consuming
that
it
would
burn
up
his
life
he
gave
himself
another
hours
but
he
had
not
to
wait
so
long
he
woke
up
after
a
short
uneasy
sleep
that
very
night
to
find
that
the
flood
was
over
him
and
he
realized
how
hopelessly
desperately
wickedly
insanely
he
loved
this
woman
who
might
have
been
his
but
was
now
the
wife
of
another
man
a
greater
than
he
and
one
to
whom
she
owed
it
that
she
was
more
glorious
than
any
other
woman
on
earth
a
queen
among
queens
a
goddess
for
what
was
any
earthly
throne
compared
to
that
she
established
in
the
hearts
and
souls
of
all
who
came
within
the
sight
and
hearing
of
her
beautiful
as
she
was
besides
beautiful
beautiful
and
what
must
be
her
love
for
the
man
who
had
taught
her
and
trained
her
and
revealed
her
towering
genius
to
herself
and
to
the
world
a
man
resplendent
also
handsome
and
tall
and
commanding
a
great
artist
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
and
the
remembrance
of
them
hand
in
hand
master
and
pupil
husband
and
wife
smiling
and
bowing
in
the
face
of
all
that
splendid
tumult
they
had
called
forth
and
could
not
quell
stung
and
tortured
and
maddened
him
so
that
he
could
not
lie
still
but
got
up
and
raged
and
rampaged
up
and
down
his
hot
narrow
stuffy
bedroom
and
longed
for
his
old
familiar
to
come
back
and
narcotize
his
trouble
and
be
his
friend
and
stay
with
him
till
he
died
illustration
and
the
remembrance
of
them
hand
in
hand
where
was
he
to
fly
for
relief
from
such
new
memories
as
these
which
would
never
cease
and
the
old
memories
and
all
the
glamour
and
grace
of
them
that
had
been
so
suddenly
called
out
of
the
grave
and
how
could
he
escape
now
that
he
felt
the
sight
of
her
face
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
would
be
a
craving
a
daily
want
like
that
of
some
poor
starving
outcast
for
warmth
and
meat
and
drink
and
little
innocent
pathetic
ineffable
sweetnesses
of
her
changing
face
kept
painting
themselves
on
his
retina
and
incomparable
tones
of
this
new
thing
her
voice
her
infinite
voice
went
ringing
in
his
head
till
he
all
but
shrieked
aloud
in
his
agony
and
then
the
poisoned
and
delirious
sweetness
of
those
mad
kisses
by
hopeless
fancy
feigned
on
lips
that
are
for
others
and
then
the
grewsome
physical
jealousy
that
miserable
inheritance
of
all
artistic
sons
of
adam
that
plague
and
torment
of
the
dramatic
plastic
imagination
which
can
idealize
so
well
and
yet
realize
alas
so
keenly
after
three
or
four
hours
spent
like
this
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
madness
was
lying
his
way
so
he
hurried
on
a
garment
and
went
and
knocked
at
taffy
door
good
god
what
the
matter
with
you
exclaimed
the
good
taffy
as
little
billee
tumbled
into
his
room
calling
out
oh
taffy
taffy
i
mad
i
think
and
then
shivering
all
over
and
stammering
incoherently
he
tried
to
tell
his
friend
what
was
the
matter
with
him
with
great
simplicity
taffy
in
much
alarm
slipped
on
his
trousers
and
made
little
billee
get
into
his
bed
and
sat
by
his
side
holding
his
hand
he
was
greatly
perplexed
fearing
the
recurrence
of
another
attack
like
that
of
five
years
back
he
did
dare
leave
him
for
an
instant
to
wake
the
laird
and
send
for
a
doctor
suddenly
little
billee
buried
his
face
in
the
pillow
and
began
to
sob
and
some
instinct
told
taffy
this
was
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
the
boy
had
always
been
a
highly
strung
emotional
and
quite
uncontrolled
a
sort
of
chap
who
had
never
been
to
school
it
was
all
a
part
of
his
genius
and
also
a
part
of
his
charm
it
would
do
him
good
once
more
to
have
a
good
blub
after
five
years
after
a
while
little
billee
grew
quieter
and
then
suddenly
he
said
what
a
miserable
ass
you
must
think
me
what
an
unmanly
duffer
why
my
friend
why
for
going
on
in
this
idiotic
way
i
really
could
help
it
i
went
mad
i
tell
you
i
been
walking
up
and
down
my
room
all
night
till
everything
seemed
to
go
round
so
have
i
you
what
for
the
very
same
reason
i
was
just
as
fond
of
trilby
as
you
were
only
she
happened
to
prefer
cried
little
billee
again
were
fond
of
trilby
i
believe
you
my
boy
in
with
her
i
believe
you
my
boy
she
never
knew
it
then
illustration
believe
you
my
boy
oh
yes
she
did
she
never
told
me
then
did
she
that
like
her
told
at
all
events
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
well
i
damned
when
that
day
we
took
her
to
meudon
with
jeannot
and
dined
at
the
garde
champêtre
and
she
danced
the
cancan
with
sandy
well
i
and
she
you
apparently
so
well
i
why
on
earth
did
she
refuse
you
oh
i
suppose
she
already
begun
to
fancy
my
friend
y
en
a
toujours
un
autre
fancy
prefer
to
well
yes
it
seem
odd
eh
old
fellow
but
there
no
accounting
for
tastes
you
know
she
built
on
such
an
ample
scale
herself
i
suppose
that
she
likes
little
uns
contrast
you
see
very
maternal
i
think
besides
you
a
smart
little
chap
and
you
ai
half
bad
and
you
got
brains
and
talent
and
lots
of
cheek
and
all
that
i
rather
a
kind
of
party
well
i
damned
comme
ça
i
took
it
lying
down
you
see
does
the
laird
know
no
and
i
do
want
him
to
nor
anybody
else
taffy
what
a
regular
downright
old
trump
you
are
glad
you
think
so
anyhow
we
both
in
the
same
boat
and
we
got
to
make
the
best
of
it
she
another
man
wife
and
probably
very
fond
of
him
i
sure
she
ought
to
be
cad
as
he
is
after
all
done
for
her
so
there
an
end
of
it
ah
there
never
be
an
end
of
it
for
never
never
oh
never
my
god
she
would
have
married
me
but
for
my
mother
meddling
and
that
stupid
old
ass
my
uncle
what
a
wife
think
of
all
she
must
have
in
her
heart
and
brain
only
to
like
that
and
o
lord
how
beautiful
she
is
a
goddess
oh
the
brow
and
cheek
and
chin
and
the
way
her
head
put
on
did
you
see
anything
like
it
oh
if
only
i
written
and
told
my
mother
i
was
going
to
marry
her
why
we
should
have
been
man
and
wife
for
five
years
by
this
time
living
at
barbizon
painting
away
like
mad
oh
what
a
heavenly
life
oh
curse
all
officious
meddling
with
other
people
affairs
oh
oh
there
you
go
again
what
the
good
and
where
do
come
in
my
friend
should
have
been
no
better
off
old
fellow
worse
than
ever
i
think
then
there
was
a
long
silence
at
length
little
billee
said
taffy
i
ca
tell
you
what
a
trump
you
are
all
i
ever
thought
of
you
and
god
knows
that
enough
will
be
nothing
to
what
i
shall
always
think
of
you
after
this
all
right
old
chap
and
now
i
think
all
right
again
for
a
time
and
i
shall
cut
back
to
bed
thanks
more
than
i
can
ever
express
and
little
billee
restored
to
his
balance
cut
back
to
his
own
bed
just
as
the
day
was
breaking
part
seventh
the
moon
made
thy
lips
pale
beloved
the
wind
made
thy
bosom
chill
the
night
did
shed
on
thy
dear
head
its
frozen
dew
and
thou
didst
lie
where
the
bitter
breath
of
the
naked
sky
might
visit
thee
at
will
next
morning
our
three
friends
lay
late
abed
and
breakfasted
in
their
rooms
they
had
all
three
passed
white
nights
even
the
laird
who
had
tossed
about
and
pressed
a
sleepless
pillow
till
dawn
so
excited
had
he
been
by
the
wonder
of
trilby
reincarnation
so
perplexed
by
his
own
doubts
as
to
whether
it
was
really
trilby
or
not
and
certain
haunting
tones
of
her
voice
that
voice
so
cruelly
sweet
which
clove
the
stillness
with
a
clang
so
utterly
new
so
strangely
and
seductive
that
the
desire
to
hear
it
once
more
became
nostalgic
almost
an
ache
certain
bits
and
bars
and
phrases
of
the
music
she
had
sung
unspeakable
felicities
and
facilities
of
execution
sudden
exotic
warmths
fragrances
tendernesses
graces
depths
and
breadths
quick
changes
from
grave
to
gay
from
rough
to
smooth
from
great
metallic
brazen
clangors
to
soft
golden
suavities
all
the
varied
modes
of
sound
we
try
so
vainly
to
borrow
from
vocal
nature
by
means
of
wind
and
reed
and
string
all
this
new
trilbyness
kept
echoing
in
his
brain
all
night
for
he
was
of
a
nature
deeply
musical
and
sleep
had
been
impossible
to
him
as
when
we
dwell
upon
a
word
we
know
repeating
till
the
word
we
know
so
well
becomes
a
wonder
and
we
know
not
why
so
dwelt
the
laird
upon
the
poor
old
tune
ben
bolt
which
kept
singing
itself
over
and
over
again
in
his
tired
consciousness
and
maddened
him
with
novel
strange
unhackneyed
unsuspected
beauties
such
as
he
had
never
dreamed
of
in
any
earthly
music
it
had
become
a
wonder
and
he
knew
not
why
they
spent
what
was
left
of
the
morning
at
the
louvre
and
tried
to
interest
themselves
in
the
marriage
of
cana
and
the
woman
at
the
well
and
vandyck
man
with
the
glove
and
the
little
princess
of
velasquez
and
lisa
gioconda
smile
it
was
of
no
use
trying
there
was
no
sight
worth
looking
at
in
all
paris
but
trilby
in
her
golden
raiment
no
other
princess
in
the
world
no
smile
but
hers
when
through
her
parted
lips
came
bubbling
chopin
impromptu
they
had
not
long
to
stay
in
paris
and
they
must
drink
of
that
bubbling
fountain
once
more
que
coûte
they
went
to
the
salle
des
bashibazoucks
and
found
that
all
seats
all
over
the
house
had
been
taken
for
days
and
weeks
and
the
queue
at
the
door
had
already
begun
and
they
had
to
give
up
all
hopes
of
slaking
this
particular
thirst
then
they
went
and
lunched
perfunctorily
and
talked
desultorily
over
lunch
and
read
criticisms
of
la
svengali
début
in
the
morning
papers
a
chorus
of
journalistic
acclamation
gone
mad
a
frenzied
eulogy
in
every
key
but
nothing
was
good
enough
for
them
words
were
wanted
another
language
then
they
wanted
a
long
walk
and
could
think
of
nowhere
to
go
in
all
paris
that
immense
paris
where
they
had
promised
themselves
to
see
so
much
that
the
week
they
were
to
spend
there
had
seemed
too
short
looking
in
a
paper
they
saw
it
announced
that
the
band
of
the
imperial
guides
would
play
that
afternoon
in
the
pré
catelan
bois
de
boulogne
and
thought
they
might
as
well
walk
there
as
anywhere
else
and
walk
back
again
in
time
to
dine
with
the
passefils
a
prandial
function
which
did
not
promise
to
be
very
amusing
but
still
it
was
something
to
kill
the
evening
with
since
they
could
go
and
hear
trilby
again
outside
the
pré
catelan
they
found
a
crowd
of
cabs
and
carriages
and
grooms
one
might
have
thought
one
self
in
the
height
of
the
paris
season
they
went
in
and
strolled
about
here
and
there
and
listened
to
the
band
which
was
famous
it
has
performed
in
london
at
the
crystal
palace
and
they
looked
about
and
studied
life
or
tried
to
suddenly
they
saw
sitting
with
three
ladies
one
of
whom
the
eldest
was
in
black
a
very
smart
young
officer
a
guide
all
red
and
green
and
gold
and
recognized
their
old
friend
zouzou
they
bowed
and
he
knew
them
at
once
and
jumped
up
and
came
to
them
and
greeted
them
warmly
especially
his
old
friend
taffy
whom
he
took
to
his
mother
the
lady
in
black
and
introduced
to
the
other
ladies
the
younger
of
whom
strangely
unlike
the
rest
of
her
countrywomen
was
so
lamentably
so
pathetically
plain
that
it
would
be
brutal
to
attempt
the
cheap
and
easy
task
of
describing
her
it
was
miss
lavinia
hunks
the
famous
american
millionairess
and
her
mother
then
the
good
zouzou
came
back
and
talked
to
the
laird
and
little
billee
zouzou
in
some
subtle
and
indescribable
way
had
become
very
ducal
indeed
he
looked
extremely
distinguished
for
one
thing
in
his
beautiful
guide
uniform
and
was
most
gracefully
and
winningly
polite
he
inquired
warmly
after
and
miss
bagot
and
begged
little
billee
would
recall
him
to
their
amiable
remembrance
when
he
saw
them
again
he
expressed
most
sympathetically
his
delight
to
see
little
billee
looking
so
strong
and
so
well
little
billee
looked
like
a
pallid
little
ghost
after
his
white
night
they
talked
of
dodor
he
said
how
attached
he
was
to
dodor
and
always
should
be
but
dodor
it
seemed
had
made
a
great
mistake
in
leaving
the
army
and
going
into
a
retail
business
he
had
done
for
himself
he
should
have
stuck
to
the
with
a
little
patience
and
good
conduct
he
would
have
won
his
epaulet
and
then
one
might
have
arranged
for
him
a
good
little
marriage
parti
for
he
was
très
joli
garçon
dodor
bonne
tournure
et
très
gentiment
né
très
ancien
les
rigolot
dans
le
poitou
je
crois
lafarce
et
tout
ça
tout
à
fait
bien
it
was
difficult
to
realize
that
this
polished
and
discreet
and
somewhat
patronizing
young
man
of
the
world
was
the
jolly
dog
who
had
gone
after
little
billee
hat
on
all
fours
in
the
rue
vieille
des
mauvais
ladres
and
brought
it
back
in
his
mouth
the
caryhatide
little
billee
little
knew
that
monsieur
le
duc
de
la
had
quite
recently
delighted
a
very
small
and
select
and
most
august
imperial
at
compiègne
with
this
very
story
not
blinking
a
single
detail
of
his
own
share
in
it
and
had
given
a
most
touching
and
sympathetic
description
of
le
joli
petit
peintre
anglais
qui
litrebili
et
ne
pouvait
pas
se
tenir
sur
ses
jambes
et
qui
pleurait
fraternel
dans
les
bras
de
mon
copain
dodor
ah
monsieur
gontran
ce
que
je
donnerais
pour
avoir
vu
ça
had
said
the
greatest
lady
in
france
un
de
mes
zouaves
à
quatre
pattes
dans
la
rue
un
chapeau
dans
la
bouche
oh
impayable
zouzou
kept
these
blackguard
bohemian
reminiscences
for
the
imperial
circle
alone
to
which
it
was
suspected
that
he
was
secretly
rallying
himself
among
all
outsiders
especially
within
the
narrow
precincts
of
the
cream
of
the
noble
faubourg
which
remained
aloof
from
the
tuileries
he
was
a
very
proper
and
gentlemanlike
person
indeed
as
his
brother
had
been
and
in
his
mother
fond
belief
très
bien
pensant
très
bien
vu
à
frohsdorf
et
à
rome
lui
aurait
donné
le
bon
dieu
sans
as
madame
vinard
had
said
of
little
billee
they
would
have
shriven
him
at
sight
and
admitted
him
to
the
holy
communion
on
trust
he
did
not
present
little
billee
and
the
laird
to
his
mother
nor
to
and
miss
hunks
that
honor
was
reserved
for
the
man
of
blood
alone
nor
did
he
ask
where
they
were
staying
nor
invite
them
to
call
on
him
but
in
parting
he
expressed
the
immense
pleasure
it
had
given
him
to
meet
them
again
and
the
hope
he
had
of
some
day
shaking
their
hands
in
london
as
the
friends
walked
back
to
paris
together
it
transpired
that
the
man
of
blood
had
been
invited
by
madame
duchesse
mère
maman
duchesse
as
zouzou
called
her
to
dine
with
her
next
day
and
meet
the
hunkses
at
a
furnished
apartment
she
had
taken
in
the
place
vendôme
for
they
had
let
to
the
hunkses
the
hôtel
de
la
rochemartel
in
the
rue
de
lille
they
had
also
been
obliged
to
let
their
place
in
the
country
le
château
de
boisségur
to
monsieur
despoires
or
des
poires
as
he
chose
to
spell
himself
on
his
the
famous
un
très
brave
homme
à
ce
dit
and
whose
only
son
soon
after
married
mademoiselle
de
roncesvaulx
de
boisségur
de

je
vous
assure
madame
duchesse
mère
had
pathetically
said
to
taffy
but
had
given
him
to
understand
that
things
would
be
very
much
better
for
her
son
in
the
event
of
his
marriage
with
miss
hunks
good
heavens
said
little
billee
on
hearing
this
that
grotesque
little
bogy
in
blue
why
she
deformed
she
squints
she
a
dwarf
and
looks
like
an
idiot
millions
or
no
millions
the
man
who
marries
her
is
a
felon
as
long
as
there
are
stones
to
break
and
a
road
to
break
them
on
the
man
who
marries
a
woman
like
that
for
anything
but
pity
and
kindness
and
even
then
dishonors
himself
insults
his
ancestry
and
inflicts
on
his
descendants
a
wrong
that
nothing
will
ever
redeem
he
nips
them
in
the
bud
he
blasts
them
forever
he
ought
to
be
cut
by
his
sent
to
coventry
to
jail
to
penal
servitude
for
life
he
ought
to
have
a
separate
hell
to
himself
when
he
dies
he
ought
to
shut
up
you
little
blaspheming
ruffian
said
the
laird
where
do
expect
to
go
to
yourself
with
such
frightful
sentiments
and
what
would
become
of
your
beautiful
old
dukedoms
with
a
hundred
yards
of
opposite
the
louvre
on
a
beautiful
historic
river
and
a
dozen
beautiful
historic
names
and
no
money
if
had
your
way
and
the
laird
wunk
his
historic
wink
dukedoms
be
damned
said
taffy
grand
as
usual
little
billee
quite
right
and
zouzou
makes
me
sick
besides
what
does
she
marry
for
not
for
his
beauty
either
i
guess
his
his
deliberate
accomplice
accessory
before
the
act
and
after
she
has
no
right
to
marry
at
all
tar
and
feathers
and
a
rail
for
both
of
them
and
for
maman
duchesse
too
and
i
suppose
that
why
i
refused
her
invitation
to
dinner
and
now
let
go
and
dine
with
dodor
anyhow
dodor
young
woman
marry
him
for
a
dukedom
or
even
his
bien
pour
ses
beaux
yeux
and
if
the
rigolots
of
the
future
turn
out
less
nice
to
look
at
than
their
sire
and
not
quite
so
amusing
they
will
probably
be
a
great
improvement
on
him
in
many
other
ways
there
room
enough
and
to
spare
illustration
maman

said
little
billee
who
always
grew
flippant
when
taffy
got
on
his
high
horse
your
and
song
sir
them
my
sentiments
to
a
t
what
shall
we
the
pleasure
of
drinkin
after
that
wery
nice
after
which
they
walked
on
in
silence
each
no
doubt
musing
on
the
general
contrariness
of
things
and
imagining
what
splendid
little
wynnes
or
bagots
or
mcalisters
might
have
been
ushered
into
a
decadent
world
for
its
regeneration
if
fate
had
so
willed
it
that
a
certain
magnificent
and
singularly
gifted
grisette
etc
and
miss
hunks
passed
them
as
they
walked
along
in
a
beautiful
blue
barouche
with
c
springs
maman
duchesse
passed
them
in
a
hired
fly
zouzou
passed
them
on
horseback
tout
paris
passed
them
but
they
were
none
the
wiser
and
agreed
that
the
show
was
not
a
patch
on
that
in
hyde
park
during
the
london
season
when
they
reached
the
place
de
la
concorde
it
was
that
lovely
hour
of
a
fine
autumn
day
in
beautiful
bright
cities
when
all
the
lamps
are
lit
in
the
shops
and
streets
and
under
the
trees
and
it
is
still
daylight
a
quickly
fleeting
joy
and
as
a
special
treat
on
this
particular
occasion
the
sun
set
and
up
rose
the
yellow
moon
over
eastern
paris
and
floated
above
the
of
the
tuileries
they
stopped
to
gaze
at
the
homeward
procession
of
cabs
and
carriages
as
they
used
to
do
in
the
old
times
tout
paris
was
still
passing
tout
paris
is
very
long
they
stood
among
a
little
crowd
of
like
themselves
little
billee
right
in
front
in
the
road
presently
a
magnificent
open
carriage
came
by
more
magnificent
than
even
the
hunkses
with
liveries
and
harness
quite
vulgarly
resplendent
almost
napoleonic
lolling
back
in
it
lay
monsieur
et
madame
svengali
he
with
his
felt
sombrero
over
his
long
black
curls
wrapped
in
costly
furs
smoking
his
big
cigar
of
the
havana
by
his
side
la
svengali
also
in
sables
with
a
large
black
velvet
hat
on
her
light
brown
hair
done
up
in
a
huge
knot
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
she
was
rouged
and
and
her
eyes
were
blackened
beneath
and
thus
made
to
look
twice
their
size
but
in
spite
of
all
such
disfigurements
she
was
a
most
splendid
vision
and
caused
quite
a
little
sensation
in
the
crowd
as
she
came
slowly
by
little
billee
heart
was
in
his
mouth
he
caught
svengali
eye
and
saw
him
speak
to
her
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
him
standing
there
they
both
did
little
billee
bowed
she
stared
at
him
with
a
cold
stare
of
disdain
and
cut
him
dead
so
did
svengali
and
as
they
passed
he
heard
them
both
snigger
she
with
a
little
flippant
snigger
worthy
of
a
london
little
billee
was
utterly
crushed
and
everything
seemed
turning
round
the
laird
and
taffy
had
seen
it
all
without
losing
a
detail
the
svengalis
had
not
even
looked
their
way
the
laird
said
it
not
trilby
i
swear
she
could
have
done
that
it
not
her
and
it
another
face
altogether
i
sure
of
it
illustration
the
cut
direct
taffy
was
also
staggered
and
in
doubt
they
caught
hold
of
little
billee
each
by
an
arm
and
walked
him
off
to
the
boulevards
he
was
quite
demoralized
and
wanted
not
to
dine
at
the
passefils
he
wanted
to
go
straight
home
at
once
he
longed
for
his
mother
as
he
used
to
long
for
her
when
he
was
in
trouble
as
a
small
boy
and
she
was
away
from
home
longed
for
her
desperately
to
hug
her
and
hold
her
and
fondle
her
and
be
fondled
for
his
own
sake
and
hers
all
his
old
love
for
her
had
come
back
in
full
with
what
arrears
all
his
old
love
for
his
sister
for
his
old
home
when
they
went
back
to
the
hotel
to
dress
for
dodor
had
begged
them
to
put
on
their
best
evening
so
as
to
impress
his
future
little
billee
became
fractious
and
intractable
and
it
was
only
on
taffy
promising
that
he
would
go
all
the
way
to
devonshire
with
him
on
the
morrow
and
stay
with
him
there
that
he
could
be
got
to
dress
and
dine
the
huge
taffy
lived
entirely
by
his
affections
and
he
had
many
to
live
by
the
laird
trilby
and
little
billee
trilby
was
unattainable
the
laird
was
quite
strong
and
independent
enough
to
get
on
by
himself
and
taffy
had
concentrated
all
his
faculties
of
protection
and
affection
on
little
billee
and
was
equal
to
any
burden
or
responsibility
all
this
instinctive
young
fathering
might
involve
in
the
first
place
little
billee
had
always
been
able
to
do
quite
easily
and
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
the
very
things
taffy
most
longed
to
do
himself
and
could
and
this
inspired
the
good
taffy
with
a
chronic
reverence
and
wonder
he
could
not
have
expressed
in
words
then
little
billee
was
physically
small
and
weak
and
incapable
of
then
he
was
generous
amiable
affectionate
transparent
as
crystal
without
an
atom
of
either
egotism
or
conceit
and
had
a
gift
of
amusing
you
and
interesting
you
by
his
talk
and
its
complete
sincerity
that
never
palled
and
even
his
silence
was
charming
one
felt
so
sure
of
him
so
there
was
hardly
any
sacrifice
little
or
big
that
big
taffy
was
not
ready
and
glad
to
make
for
little
billee
on
the
other
hand
there
lay
deep
down
under
taffy
surface
irascibility
and
earnestness
about
trifles
and
beneath
his
harmless
vanity
of
the
strong
man
a
patience
a
real
humility
a
robustness
of
judgment
a
sincerity
and
a
completeness
of
sympathy
that
made
him
very
good
to
trust
and
safe
to
lean
upon
then
his
powerful
impressive
aspect
his
great
stature
the
gladiatorlike
poise
of
his
small
round
head
on
his
big
neck
and
shoulders
his
huge
deltoids
and
deep
chest
and
slender
loins
his
ankles
and
wrists
all
the
long
and
bold
and
athletic
shapes
of
him
that
easy
grace
of
strength
that
made
all
his
movements
a
pleasure
to
watch
and
any
garment
look
well
when
he
wore
it
all
this
was
a
perpetual
feast
to
the
quick
prehensile
æsthetic
eye
and
then
he
had
such
a
solemn
earnest
lovable
way
of
bending
pokers
round
his
neck
and
breaking
them
on
his
arm
and
jumping
his
own
height
or
near
it
and
lifting
up
by
one
leg
with
one
hand
and
what
not
else
so
that
there
was
hardly
any
sacrifice
little
or
big
that
little
billee
would
not
accept
from
big
taffy
as
a
mere
matter
of
course
a
fitting
and
proper
tribute
rendered
by
bodily
strength
to
genius
nobile
well
met
and
well
mated
for
fast
and
friendship
the
family
banquet
at
monsieur
passefil
would
have
been
dull
but
for
the
irrepressible
dodor
and
still
more
for
the
laird
of
cockpen
who
rose
to
the
occasion
and
surpassed
himself
in
geniality
drollery
and
eccentricity
of
french
grammar
and
accent
monsieur
passefil
was
also
a
droll
in
his
way
and
had
the
quickly
familiar
jocose
facetiousness
that
seems
to
belong
to
the
successful
bourgeois
all
over
the
world
when
he
not
pompous
instead
he
can
even
be
both
sometimes
madame
passefil
was
not
jocose
she
was
much
impressed
by
the
aristocratic
splendor
of
taffy
the
romantic
melancholy
and
refinement
of
little
billee
and
their
quiet
and
dignified
politeness
she
always
spoke
of
dodor
as
monsieur
de
lafarce
though
the
rest
of
the
family
and
one
or
two
friends
who
had
been
invited
always
called
him
monsieur
théodore
and
he
was
officially
known
as
monsieur
rigolot
whenever
madame
passefil
addressed
him
or
spoke
of
him
in
this
aristocratic
manner
which
happened
very
often
dodor
would
wink
at
his
friends
with
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
it
seemed
to
amuse
him
beyond
measure
mademoiselle
ernestine
was
evidently
too
much
in
love
to
say
anything
and
seldom
took
her
eyes
off
monsieur
théodore
whom
she
had
never
seen
in
evening
dress
before
it
must
be
owned
that
he
looked
very
nice
more
ducal
than
even
zouzou
and
to
be
madame
de
lafarce
and
the
future
owner
of
such
a
brilliant
husband
as
dodor
was
enough
to
turn
a
stronger
little
bourgeois
head
than
mademoiselle
ernestine
she
was
not
beautiful
but
healthy
well
grown
well
brought
up
and
presumably
of
a
sweet
kind
and
amiable
disposition
an
fresh
from
her
convent
innocent
as
a
child
no
doubt
and
it
was
felt
that
dodor
had
done
better
for
himself
and
for
his
race
than
monsieur
le
duc
little
dodors
need
have
no
fear
after
dinner
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
left
the
together
and
sat
in
a
pretty
salon
overlooking
the
boulevard
where
cigarettes
were
allowed
and
there
was
music
mademoiselle
ernestine
laboriously
played
les
cloches
du
monastère
by
monsieur
if
i
not
mistaken
it
the
most
bourgeois
piece
of
music
i
know

then
dodor
with
his
sweet
high
voice
so
strangely
pathetic
and
true
sang
little
french
songs
of
innocence
of
which
he
seemed
to
have

répertoire

to
the
immense
delight

of
all
his
future
family

were
almost
in
tears
and
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
laird
at
whom
he
winked
in
the
most
pathetic
parts
putting
his
forefinger
to
the
side
of
his
nose
like
noah
claypole
in
the
wonder
of
the
hour
la
svengali
was
discussed
of
course
it
was
unavoidable
but
our
friends
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
reveal
that
she
was
la
grande
trilby
that
would
soon
transpire
by
itself
and
indeed
before
the
month
was
a
week
older
the
papers
were
full
of
nothing
else
madame
svengali
la
grande
trilby
was
the
only
daughter
of
the
honorable
and
reverend
sir
lord
she
had
run
away
from
the
primeval
forests
and
lonely
marshes
of
le
dublin
to
lead
a
life
among
the
artists
of
the
quartier
latin
of
paris
vie
de
bohème
she
was
the

to

she
was

casts
of
her
alabaster
feet
could
be
had
at
brucciani
in
the
rue
de
la
souricière
denis
he
made
a
fortune
monsieur
ingres
had
painted
her
left
foot
on
the
wall
of
a
studio
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
and
an
eccentric
scotch
milord
le
comte
de
pencock
had
bought
the
house
containing
the
flat
containing
the
studio
containing
the
wall
on
which
it
was
painted
had
had
the
house
pulled
down
and
the
wall
framed
and
glazed
and
sent
to
his
castle
of
édimbourg
this
unfortunately
was
in
excess
of
the
truth
it
was
found
impossible
to
execute
the
laird
wish
on
account
of
the
material
the
wall
was
made
of
so
the
lord
count
of
pencock
such
was
madame
version
of
sandy
nickname
had
to
forego
his
purchase
next
morning
our
friends
were
in
readiness
to
leave
paris
even
the
laird
had
had
enough
of
it
and
longed
to
get
back
to
his
work
again
a
in
yokohama
he
had
never
been
to
japan
but
no
more
had
any
one
else
in
those
early
days
they
had
just
finished
breakfast
and
were
sitting
in
the
of
the
hotel
which
was
crowded
as
usual
little
billee
went
into
the
hotel
to
despatch
a
note
to
his
mother
sitting
sideways
there
at
a
small
table
and
reading
letters
was
svengali
of
all
people
in
the
world
but
for
these
two
and
a
couple
of
clerks
the
room
was
empty
svengali
looked
up
they
were
quite
close
together
little
billee
in
his
nervousness
began
to
shake
and
half
put
out
his
hand
and
drew
it
back
again
seeing
the
look
of
hate
on
face
svengali
jumped
up
put
his
letters
together
and
passing
by
little
billee
on
his
way
to
the
door
called
him
verfluchter
schweinhund
and
deliberately
spat
in
his
face
little
billee
was
paralyzed
for
a
second
or
two
then
he
ran
after
svengali
and
caught
him
just
at
the
top
of
the
marble
stairs
and
kicked
him
and
knocked
off
his
hat
and
made
him
drop
all
his
letters
svengali
turned
round
and
struck
him
over
the
mouth
and
made
it
bleed
and
little
billee
hit
out
like
a
fury
but
with
no
effect
he
reach
high
enough
for
svengali
was
well
over
six
feet
there
was
a
crowd
round
them
in
a
minute
including
the
beautiful
old
man
in
the
court
suit
and
gold
chain
who
called
out
vite
vite
un
commissaire
de
police
a
cry
that
was
echoed
all
over
the
place
taffy
saw
the
row
and
shouted
bravo
little
un
and
jumping
up
from
his
table
jostled
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
little
billee
bleeding
and
gasping
and
perspiring
and
stammering
said
he
spat
in
my
face
taffy
damn
him
i
never
even
spoken
to
him
not
a
word
i
swear
svengali
had
not
reckoned
on
taffy
being
there
he
recognized
him
at
once
and
turned
white
taffy
who
had
gloves
on
put
out
his
right
hand
and
deftly
seized
svengali
nose
between
his
fore
and
middle
fingers
and
nearly
pulled
it
off
and
swung
his
head
two
or
three
times
backward
and
forward
by
it
and
then
from
side
to
side
svengali
holding
on
to
his
wrist
and
then
letting
him
go
gave
him
a
sounding
smack
on
his
right
cheek
and
a
smack
on
the
face
from
taffy
even
in
play
was
no
joke
i
told
it
made
one
smell
brimstone
and
see
and
hear
things
that
did
exist
svengali
gasped
worse
than
little
billee
and
could
speak
for
a
while
then
he
said
lâche
grand
lâche
che
fous
enferrai
mes
témoins
at
your
orders
said
taffy
in
beautiful
french
and
drew
out
his
and
gave
him
his
card
in
quite
the
orthodox
french
manner
adding
i
shall
be
here
till
at
twelve
but
that
is
my
london
address
in
case
i
do
hear
from
you
before
i
leave
i
sorry
but
you
really
must
spit
you
know
it
not
done
i
will
come
to
you
whenever
you
send
for
me
even
if
i
have
to
come
from
the
end
of
the
world
très
bien
très
bien
said
a
old
gentleman
close
by
who
gave
taffy
card
in
case
he
might
be
of
any
service
and
who
seemed
quite
delighted
at
the
row
and
indeed
it
was
really
pleasant
to
note
with
what
a
smooth
flowing
rhythmical
spontaneity
the
good
taffy
could
always
improvise
these
swift
little
acts
of
summary
retributive
justice
no
hurry
or
scurry
or
flurry
whatever
not
an
inharmonious
gesture
not
an
infelicitous
line
the
very
poetry
of
violence
and
its
only
excuse
whatever
it
was
worth
this
was
taffy
special
gift
and
it
never
failed
him
at
a
pinch
when
the
commissaire
de
police
arrived
all
was
over
svengali
had
gone
away
in
a
cab
and
taffy
put
himself
at
the
disposition
of
the
commissaire
they
went
into
the
and
discussed
it
all
with
the
old
military
gentleman
and
the
in
velvet
and
the
two
clerks
who
had
seen
the
original
insult
and
all
that
was
required
of
taffy
and
his
friends
for
the
present
was
their
names
prenames
titles
qualities
age
address
nationality
occupation
etc

vite
un
commissaire
de
police
une
affaire
qui
autrement
et
autre
part
had
said
the
military
gentleman
monsieur
le
général
comte
de
la
so
it
blew
over
quite
simply
and
all
that
day
a
fierce
unholy
joy
burned
in
taffy
choleric
blue
eye
not
indeed
that
he
had
any
wish
to
injure
trilby
husband
or
meant
to
do
him
any
grievous
bodily
harm
whatever
happened
but
he
was
glad
to
have
given
svengali
a
lesson
in
manners
that
svengali
should
injure
never
entered
into
his
calculations
for
a
moment
besides
he
did
believe
svengali
would
show
fight
and
in
this
he
was
not
mistaken
but
he
had
for
hours
the
feel
of
that
long
thick
shapely
hebrew
nose
being
kneaded
between
his
gloved
knuckles
and
a
pleasing
sense
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
tweak
he
had
given
it
so
he
went
about
chewing
the
cud
of
that
heavenly
remembrance
all
day
till
reflection
brought
remorse
and
he
felt
sorry
for
he
was
really
the
man
that
ever
broke
a
head
only
the
sight
of
little
billee
blood
which
had
been
made
to
flow
by
such
an
unequal
antagonist
had
roused
the
old
adam
no
message
came
from
svengali
to
ask
for
the
names
and
addresses
of
taffy
seconds
so
dodor
and
zouzou
not
to
mention
mister
the
general
count
of
the
tooraloorals
as
the
laird
called
him
were
left
undisturbed
and
our
three
musketeers
went
back
to
london
clean
of
blood
whole
of
limb
and
heartily
sick
of
paris
little
billee
stayed
with
his
mother
and
sister
in
devonshire
till
christmas
taffy
staying
at
the
village
inn
it
was
taffy
who
told
bagot
about
la
svengali
all
but
certain
identity
with
trilby
after
little
billee
had
gone
to
bed
tired
and
worn
out
the
night
of
their
arrival
good
heavens
said
poor
bagot
why
that
the
new
singing
woman
who
coming
over
here
there
an
article
about
her
in
it
says
she
a
wonder
and
that
there
no
one
like
her
surely
that
ca
be
the
miss
i
saw
in
paris
it
seems
impossible
but
i
almost
certain
it
is
and
willy
has
no
doubts
in
the
matter
on
the
other
hand
mcalister
declares
it
is
oh
what
trouble
so
why
poor
willy
looks
so
ill
and
miserable
it
all
come
back
again
could
she
sing
at
all
then
when
you
knew
her
in
paris
not
a
note
her
attempts
at
singing
were
quite
grotesque
is
she
still
very
beautiful
oh
yes
there
no
doubt
about
that
more
than
ever
and
her
singing
is
that
so
very
wonderful
i
remember
that
she
had
a
beautiful
voice
in
speaking
wonderful
ah
yes
i
never
heard
or
dreamed
the
like
of
it
grisi
alboni
patti
not
one
of
them
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
good
heavens
why
she
must
be
simply
irresistible
i
wonder
you
not
in
love
with
her
yourself
how
dreadful
these
sirens
are
wrecking
the
peace
of
families
you
must
forget
that
she
gave
way
at
once
at
a
word
from
you
bagot
and
she
was
very
fond
of
willy
she
was
a
siren
then
oh
yes
oh
yes
that
true
she
behaved
very
well
she
did
her
duty
i
ca
deny
that
you
must
try
and
forgive
me
wynne
although
i
ca
forgive
that
dreadful
illness
of
poor
willy
that
bitter
time
in
paris
and
bagot
began
to
cry
and
taffy
forgave
oh
wynne
let
us
still
hope
that
there
some
mistake
that
it
only
somebody
like
her
why
she
coming
to
sing
in
london
after
christmas
my
poor
infatuation
will
only
increase
what
i
do
well
she
another
man
wife
you
see
so
willy
infatuation
is
bound
to
burn
itself
out
as
soon
as
he
fully
recognizes
that
important
fact
besides
she
cut
him
dead
in
the
champs
élysées
and
her
husband
and
willy
had
a
row
next
day
at
the
hotel
and
cuffed
and
kicked
each
other
that
rather
a
bar
to
any
future
intimacy
i
think
oh
wynne
my
son
cuffing
and
kicking
a
man
whose
wife
he
in
love
with
good
heavens
oh
it
was
all
right
the
man
had
grossly
insulted
him
and
willy
behaved
like
a
brick
and
got
the
best
of
it
in
the
end
and
nothing
came
of
it
i
saw
it
all
oh
wynne
and
you
did
interfere
oh
yes
i
interfered
everybody
interfered
it
was
all
right
i
assure
you
no
bones
were
broken
on
either
side
and
there
was
no
nonsense
about
calling
out
or
swords
or
pistols
and
all
that
illustration
i
suppose
you
do
all
this
kind
of
thing
for
mere
amusement
mr
wynne
thank
heaven
in
a
week
or
two
little
billee
grew
more
like
himself
again
and
painted
endless
studies
of
rocks
and
cliffs
and
sea
and
taffy
painted
with
him
and
was
very
content
the
vicar
and
little
billee
patched
up
their
feud
the
vicar
also
took
an
immense
fancy
to
taffy
whose
cousin
sir
oscar
wynne
he
had
known
at
college
and
lost
no
opportunity
of
being
hospitable
and
civil
to
him
and
his
daughter
was
away
in
algiers
and
all
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
the
neighborhood
including
the
poor
dear
marquis
one
of
whose
sons
was
in
taffy
old
regiment
were
civil
and
hospitable
also
to
the
two
painters
and
taffy
got
as
much
sport
as
he
wanted
and
became
immensely
popular
and
they
had
on
the
whole
a
very
good
time
till
christmas
and
a
very
pleasant
christmas
if
not
an
exuberantly
merry
one
after
christmas
little
billee
insisted
on
going
back
to
london
to
paint
a
picture
for
the
royal
academy
and
taffy
went
with
him
and
there
was
dulness
in
the
house
of
bagot
and
many
misgivings
in
the
maternal
heart
of
its
mistress
and
people
of
all
kinds
high
and
low
from
the
family
at
the
court
to
the
fishermen
on
the
little
pier
and
their
wives
and
children
missed
the
two
genial
painters
who
were
the
friends
of
everybody
and
made
such
beautiful
sketches
of
their
beautiful
coast
la
svengali
has
arrived
in
london
her
name
is
in
every
mouth
her
photograph
is
in
the
she
is
to
sing
at
j
monster
concerts
next
week
she
was
to
have
sung
sooner
but
it
seems
some
hitch
has
occurred
a
quarrel
between
monsieur
svengali
and
his
first
violin
who
is
a
very
important
person
a
crowd
of
people
as
usual
only
bigger
is
assembled
in
front
of
the
windows
of
the
stereoscopic
company
in
regent
street
gazing
at
presentments
of
madame
svengali
in
all
sizes
and
costumes
she
is
very
beautiful
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
and
the
expression
of
her
face
is
sweet
and
kind
and
sad
and
of
such
a
distinction
that
one
feels
an
imperial
crown
would
become
her
even
better
than
her
modest
little
coronet
of
golden
stars
one
of
the
photographs
represents
her
in
classical
dress
with
her
left
foot
on
a
little
stool
in
something
of
the
attitude
of
the
venus
of
milo
except
that
her
hands
are
clasped
behind
her
back
and
the
foot
is
bare
but
for
a
greek
sandal
and
so
smooth
and
delicate
and
charming
and
with
so
rhythmical
a
set
and
curl
of
the
five
slender
toes
the
big
one
slightly
and
well
apart
from
its
longer
and
slighter
and
more
aquiline
neighbor
that
this
presentment
of
her
sells
quicker
than
all
the
rest
and
a
little
man
who
with
two
bigger
men
has
just
forced
his
way
in
front
says
to
one
of
his
friends
look
sandy
look
foot
have
you
got
any
doubts
oh
yes
those
are
trilby
toes
sure
enough
says
sandy
and
they
all
go
in
and
purchase
largely
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
discover
the
row
between
svengali
and
his
first
violin
had
occurred
at
a
rehearsal
in
drury
lane
theatre
svengali
it
seems
had
never
been
quite
the
same
since
the
of
october
previous
and
that
was
the
day
he
had
got
his
face
slapped
and
his
nose
tweaked
by
taffy
in
paris
he
had
become
and
irritable
especially
with
his
wife
if
she
his
wife
svengali
it
seems
had
reasons
for
passionately
hating
little
billee
he
had
not
seen
him
for
five
years
not
since
the
christmas
festivity
in
the
place
anatole
when
they
had
sparred
together
after
supper
and
svengali
nose
had
got
in
the
way
on
this
occasion
and
had
been
made
to
bleed
but
that
was
not
why
he
hated
little
billee
when
he
caught
sight
of
him
standing
on
the
curb
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
watching
the
procession
of
tout
paris
he
knew
him
directly
and
all
his
hate
flared
up
he
cut
him
dead
and
made
his
wife
do
the
same
next
morning
he
saw
him
again
in
the
hotel
looking
small
and
weak
and
flurried
and
apparently
alone
and
being
an
oriental
israelite
hebrew
jew
he
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
temptation
of
spitting
in
his
face
since
he
must
not
throttle
him
to
death
the
minute
he
had
done
this
he
had
regretted
the
folly
of
it
little
billee
had
run
after
him
and
kicked
and
struck
him
and
he
had
returned
the
blow
and
drawn
blood
and
then
suddenly
and
quite
unexpectedly
had
come
upon
the
scene
that
apparition
so
loathed
and
dreaded
of
old
the
yorkshireman
the
huge
british
philistine
the
irresponsible
bull
the
junker
the
who
had
always
reminded
him
of
the
brutal
and
contemptuous
aristocrats
of
his
own
country
ruffians
that
treated
jews
like
dogs
callous
as
he
was
to
the
woes
of
others
the
and
musician
was
extra
sensitive
about
himself
a
very
bundle
of
nerves
and
especially
sensitive
to
pain
and
rough
usage
and
by
no
means
physically
brave
the
stern
choleric
invincible
blue
eye
of
the
hated
northern
gentile
had
cowed
him
at
once
and
that
violent
tweaking
of
his
nose
that
heavy
blow
on
his
face
had
so
shaken
and
demoralized
him
that
he
had
never
recovered
from
it
he
was
thinking
about
it
always
night
and
day
and
constantly
dreaming
at
night
that
he
was
being
tweaked
and
slapped
over
again
by
a
colossal
nightmare
taffy
and
waking
up
in
agonies
of
terror
rage
and
shame
all
healthy
sleep
had
forsaken
him
moreover
he
was
much
older
than
he
looked
nearly
fifty
and
far
from
sound
his
life
had
been
a
long
hard
struggle
he
had
for
his
wife
slave
and
pupil
a
fierce
jealous
kind
of
affection
that
was
a
source
of
endless
torment
to
him
for
indelibly
graven
in
her
heart
which
he
wished
to
occupy
alone
was
the
image
of
the
little
english
painter
and
of
this
she
made
no
secret
gecko
no
longer
cared
for
the
master
all
gecko
doglike
devotion
was
concentrated
on
the
slave
and
pupil
whom
he
worshipped
with
a
fierce
but
pure
and
unselfish
passion
the
only
living
soul
that
svengali
could
trust
was
the
old
jewess
who
lived
with
them
his
relative
but
even
she
had
come
to
love
the
pupil
as
much
as
the
master
on
the
occasion
of
this
rehearsal
at
drury
lane
he
svengali
was
conducting
and
madame
svengali
was
singing
he
interrupted
her
several
times
angrily
and
most
unjustly
and
told
her
she
was
singing
out
of
tune
like
a
verfluchter
tomcat
which
was
quite
untrue
she
was
singing
beautifully
home
sweet
home
finally
he
struck
her
two
or
three
smart
blows
on
her
knuckles
with
his
little
bâton
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
weeping
and
crying
out
oh
oh
svengali
ne
me
battez
pas
mon
ami
je
fais
tout
ce
que
je
peux
on
which
little
gecko
had
suddenly
jumped
up
and
struck
svengali
on
the
neck
near
the
and
then
it
was
seen
that
he
had
a
little
bloody
knife
in
his
hand
and
blood
flowed
from
svengali
neck
and
at
the
sight
of
it
svengali
had
fainted
and
madame
svengali
had
taken
his
head
on
her
lap
looking
dazed
and
stupefied
as
in
a
waking
dream
gecko
had
been
disarmed
but
as
svengali
recovered
from
his
faint
and
was
taken
home
the
police
had
not
been
sent
for
and
the
affair
was
hushed
up
and
a
public
scandal
avoided
but
la
svengali
first
appearance
to
monsieur
j
despair
had
to
be
put
off
for
a
week
for
svengali
would
not
allow
her
to
sing
without
him
nor
indeed
would
he
be
parted
from
her
for
a
minute
or
trust
her
out
of
his
sight
the
wound
was
a
slight
one
the
doctor
who
attended
svengali
described
the
wife
as
being
quite
imbecile
no
doubt
from
grief
and
anxiety
but
she
never
left
her
husband
bedside
for
a
moment
and
had
the
obedience
and
devotion
of
a
dog
when
the
night
came
round
for
the
postponed
début
svengali
was
allowed
by
the
doctor
to
go
to
the
theatre
but
he
was
absolutely
forbidden
to
conduct
illustration
the
first
violin
loses
his
temper
his
grief
and
anxiety
at
this
were
uncontrollable
he
raved
like
a
madman
and
monsieur
j
was
almost
as
bad
monsieur
j
had
been
conducting
the
svengali
band
at
rehearsals
during
the
week
in
the
absence
of
its
master
an
easy
task
it
had
been
so
thoroughly
drilled
and
knew
its
business
so
well
that
it
could
almost
conduct
itself
and
it
had
played
all
the
music
it
had
to
play
much
of
which
consisted
of
accompaniments
to
la
svengali
songs
many
times
before
her
répertoire
was
immense
and
svengali
had
written
these
orchestral
scores
with
great
care
and
felicity
on
the
famous
night
it
was
arranged
that
svengali
should
sit
in
a
box
alone
exactly
opposite
his
wife
place
on
the
platform
where
she
could
see
him
well
and
a
code
of
simple
signals
was
arranged
between
him
and
monsieur
j
and
the
band
so
that
virtually
he
might
conduct
himself
from
his
box
should
any
hesitation
or
hitch
occur
this
arrangement
was
rehearsed
the
day
before
a
sunday
and
had
turned
out
quite
successfully
and
la
svengali
had
sung
in
perfection
in
the
empty
theatre
when
monday
evening
arrived
everything
seemed
to
be
going
smoothly
the
house
was
soon
crammed
to
suffocation
all
but
the
middle
box
on
the
grand
tier
it
was
not
a
promenade
concert
and
the
pit
was
turned
into
guinea
stalls
the
promenade
concerts
were
to
be
given
a
week
later
right
in
the
middle
of
these
stalls
sat
the
laird
and
taffy
and
little
billee
the
band
came
in
by
degrees
and
tuned
their
instruments
eyes
were
constantly
being
turned
to
the
empty
box
and
people
wondered
what
royal
personages
would
appear
monsieur
j
took
his
place
amid
immense
applause
and
bowed
in
his
inimitable
way
looking
often
at
the
empty
box
then
he
tapped
and
waved
his
bâton
and
the
band
played
its
hungarian
dance
music
with
immense
success
when
this
was
over
there
was
a
pause
and
soon
some
signs
of
impatience
from
the
gallery
monsieur
j
had
disappeared
taffy
stood
up
his
back
to
the
orchestra
looking
round
some
one
came
into
the
empty
box
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
front
gazing
at
the
house
a
tall
man
deathly
pale
with
long
black
hair
and
a
beard
it
was
svengali
he
caught
sight
of
taffy
and
met
his
eyes
and
taffy
said
good
god
look
look
then
little
billee
and
the
laird
got
up
and
looked
illustration
hast
thou
found
me
o
mine
enemy
and
svengali
for
a
moment
glared
at
them
and
the
expression
of
his
face
was
so
terrible
with
wonder
rage
and
fear
that
they
were
quite
appalled
and
then
he
sat
down
still
glaring
at
taffy
the
whites
of
his
eyes
showing
at
the
top
and
his
teeth
bared
in
a
spasmodic
grin
of
hate
then
thunders
of
applause
filled
the
house
and
turning
round
and
seating
themselves
taffy
and
little
billee
and
the
laird
saw
trilby
being
led
by
j
down
the
platform
between
the
players
to
the
front
her
face
smiling
rather
vacantly
her
eyes
anxiously
intent
on
svengali
in
his
box
she
made
her
bows
to
right
and
left
just
as
she
had
done
in
paris
the
band
struck
up
the
opening
bars
of
ben
bolt
with
which
she
was
announced
to
make
her
début
she
still
stared
but
she
did
sing
and
they
played
the
little
symphony
three
times
one
could
hear
monsieur
j
in
a
hoarse
anxious
whisper
saying
mais
chantez
donc
madame
pour
de
dieu
commencez
donc
commencez
she
turned
round
with
an
extraordinary
expression
of
face
and
said
chanter
pourquoi
donc
que
je
chante
moi
chanter
quoi
alors
mais
bolt
parbleu
chantez
ah
bolt
oui
je
connais
ça
then
the
band
began
again
and
she
tried
but
failed
to
begin
herself
she
turned
round
and
said
comment
diable
que
je
chante
avec
tout
ce
train
font
ces
diables
de
musiciens
mais
mon
dieu
madame
que
vous
avez
donc
cried
monsieur
j
illustration
do
you
remember
sweet
alice
ben
bolt
que
mieux
chanter
sans
toute
cette
satanée
musique
parbleu
mieux
chanter
toute
seule
sans
musique
alors
mais
chantez
chantez
the
band
was
stopped
the
house
was
in
a
state
of
indescribable
wonder
and
suspense
she
looked
all
round
and
down
at
herself
and
fingered
her
dress
then
she
looked
up
to
the
chandelier
with
a
tender
sentimental
smile
and
began
oh
do
you
remember
sweet
alice
ben
bolt
sweet
alice
with
hair
so
brown
who
wept
with
delight
when
you
gave
her
a
smile
she
had
not
got
further
than
this
when
the
whole
house
was
in
an
uproar
shouts
from
the
gallery
shouts
of
laughter
hoots
hisses
catcalls
she
stopped
and
glared
like
a
brave
lioness
and
called
out
que
vous
avez
donc
tous
tas
de
vieilles
pommes
cuites
que
vous
êtes
a
peur
de
vous
and
then
suddenly
why
you
all
english
are
you
what
all
the
row
about
what
have
you
brought
me
here
for
what
have
done
i
should
like
to
know
and
in
asking
these
questions
the
depth
and
splendor
of
her
voice
were
so
extraordinary
its
tone
so
pathetically
feminine
yet
so
full
of
hurt
and
indignant
command
that
the
tumult
was
stilled
for
a
moment
it
was
the
voice
of
some
being
from
another
world
some
insulted
daughter
of
a
race
more
puissant
and
nobler
than
ours
a
voice
that
seemed
as
if
it
could
never
utter
a
false
note
then
came
a
voice
from
the
gods
in
answer
oh
ye
henglish
har
yer
why
do
yer
sing
as
yer
to
sing
yer
got
enough
why
do
yer
sing
in
sing
in
cried
trilby
i
did
want
to
sing
at
all
i
only
sang
because
i
was
asked
to
sing
that
gentleman
asked
me
that
french
gentleman
with
the
white
waistcoat
i
wo
sing
another
note
oh
yer
wo
wo
yer
then
let
us
our
money
back
or
know
what
for
and
again
the
din
broke
out
and
the
uproar
was
frightful
monsieur
j
screamed
out
across
the
theatre
svengali
svengali
a
donc
votre
femme
elle
est
devenue
folle
indeed
she
had
tried
to
sing
ben
bolt
but
had
sung
it
in
her
old
way
as
she
used
to
sing
it
in
the
quartier
latin
the
most
lamentably
grotesque
performance
ever
heard
out
of
a
human
throat
svengali
svengali
shrieked
poor
monsieur
j
gesticulating
towards
the
box
where
svengali
was
sitting
quite
impassible
gazing
at
monsieur
j
and
smiling
a
ghastly
sardonic
smile
a
rictus
of
hate
and
triumphant
revenge
as
if
he
were
saying
i
got
the
laugh
of
you
this
time
taffy
the
laird
little
billee
the
whole
house
were
now
staring
at
svengali
and
his
wife
was
forgotten
she
stood
vacantly
looking
at
everybody
and
everything
the
chandelier
monsieur
j
svengali
in
his
box
the
people
in
the
stalls
in
the
gallery
and
smiling
as
if
the
noisy
scene
amused
and
excited
her
svengali
svengali
svengali
the
whole
house
took
up
the
cry
derisively
monsieur
j
led
madame
svengali
away
she
seemed
quite
passive
that
terrible
figure
of
svengali
still
sat
immovable
watching
his
wife
retreat
still
smiling
his
ghastly
smile
all
eyes
were
now
turned
on
him
once
more
monsieur
j
was
then
seen
to
enter
his
box
with
a
policeman
and
two
or
three
other
men
one
of
them
in
evening
dress
he
quickly
drew
the
curtains
to
then
a
minute
or
two
after
he
reappeared
on
the
platform
bowing
and
scraping
to
the
audience
as
pale
as
death
and
called
for
silence
the
gentleman
in
evening
dress
by
his
side
and
this
person
explained
that
a
very
dreadful
thing
had
happened
that
monsieur
svengali
had
suddenly
died
in
that
box
of
apoplexy
or
that
his
wife
had
seen
it
from
her
place
on
the
stage
and
had
apparently
gone
out
of
her
senses
which
accounted
for
her
extraordinary
behavior
he
added
that
the
money
would
be
returned
at
the
doors
and
begged
the
audience
to
disperse
quietly
taffy
with
his
two
friends
behind
him
forced
his
way
to
a
stage
door
he
knew
the
laird
had
no
longer
any
doubts
on
the
score
of
identity
trilby
at
all
events
taffy
knocked
and
thumped
till
the
door
was
opened
and
gave
his
card
to
the
man
who
opened
it
stating
that
he
and
his
friends
were
old
friends
of
madame
svengali
and
must
see
her
at
once
the
man
tried
to
slam
the
door
in
his
face
but
taffy
pushed
through
and
shut
it
on
the
crowd
outside
and
insisted
on
being
taken
to
monsieur
j
immediately
and
was
so
authoritative
and
big
and
looked
such
a
swell
that
the
man
was
cowed
and
led
him
they
passed
an
open
door
through
which
they
had
a
glimpse
of
a
prostrate
form
on
a
table
a
man
partially
undressed
and
some
men
bending
over
him
doctors
probably
that
was
the
last
they
saw
of
svengali
then
they
were
taken
to
another
door
and
monsieur
j
came
out
and
taffy
explained
who
they
were
and
they
were
admitted
la
svengali
was
there
sitting
in
an
by
the
fire
with
several
of
the
band
standing
round
gesticulating
and
talking
german
or
polish
or
yiddish
gecko
on
his
knees
was
alternately
chafing
her
hands
and
feet
she
seemed
quite
dazed
but
at
the
sight
of
taffy
she
jumped
up
and
rushed
at
him
saying
oh
taffy
dear
oh
taffy
what
it
all
about
where
on
earth
am
i
what
an
age
since
we
met
then
she
caught
sight
of
the
laird
and
kissed
him
and
then
she
recognized
little
billee
she
looked
at
him
for
a
long
while
in
great
surprise
and
then
shook
hands
with
him
how
pale
you
are
and
so
changed
you
got
a
mustache
what
the
matter
why
are
you
all
dressed
in
black
with
white
cravats
as
if
you
were
going
to
a
ball
where
svengali
i
should
like
to
go
home
where
what
do
you
call
home
i
mean
where
is
it
asked
taffy
à
de
normandie
dans
le
haymarket
on
va
vous
y
conduire
madame
said
monsieur
j
oui
ça
said
trilby
hôtel
de
normandie
mais
svengali
où
est
hélas
madame
il
est
très
malade
malade
a
how
funny
you
look
with
your
mustache
little
billee
dear
little
billee
so
pale
so
very
pale
are
you
ill
too
oh
i
hope
not
how
i
am
to
see
you
again
you
tell
though
i
promised
your
mother
i
would
never
never
where
are
we
now
dear
little
billee
monsieur
j
seemed
to
have
lost
his
head
he
was
constantly
running
in
and
out
of
the
room
distracted
the
bandsmen
began
to
talk
and
try
to
explain
in
incomprehensible
french
to
taffy
gecko
seemed
to
have
disappeared
it
was
a
bewildering
business
noises
from
outside
the
tramp
and
bustle
and
shouts
of
the
departing
crowd
people
running
in
and
out
and
asking
for
monsieur
j
policemen
firemen
and
what
not
then
little
billee
who
had
been
exerting
the
most
heroic
suggested
that
trilby
should
come
to
his
house
in
fitzroy
square
first
of
all
and
be
taken
out
of
all
this
and
the
idea
struck
taffy
as
a
happy
one
and
it
was
proposed
to
monsieur
j
who
saw
that
our
three
friends
were
old
friends
of
madame
svengali
and
people
to
be
trusted
and
he
was
only
too
glad
to
be
relieved
of
her
and
gave
his
consent
illustration
the
last
they
saw
of
svengali
little
billee
and
taffy
drove
to
fitzroy
square
to
prepare
little
billee
landlady
who
was
much
put
out
at
first
at
having
such
a
novel
and
unexpected
charge
imposed
on
her
it
was
all
explained
to
her
that
it
must
be
so
that
madame
svengali
the
greatest
singer
in
europe
and
an
old
friend
of
her
tenant
had
suddenly
gone
out
of
her
mind
from
grief
at
the
tragic
death
of
her
husband
and
that
for
this
night
at
least
the
unhappy
lady
must
sleep
under
that
roof
indeed
in
little
billee
own
bed
and
that
he
would
sleep
at
a
hotel
and
that
a
nurse
would
be
provided
at
once
it
might
be
only
for
that
one
night
and
that
the
lady
was
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
and
would
probably
recover
her
faculties
after
a
night
rest
a
doctor
was
sent
for
from
close
by
and
soon
trilby
appeared
with
the
laird
and
her
appearance
and
her
magnificent
sables
impressed
godwin
the
landlady
brought
her
figuratively
on
her
knees
then
taffy
the
laird
and
little
billee
departed
again
and
dispersed
to
procure
a
nurse
for
the
night
to
find
gecko
to
fetch
some
of
trilby
belongings
from
the
hôtel
de
normandie
and
her
maid
the
maid
the
old
german
jewess
and
svengali
relative
distracted
by
the
news
of
her
master
death
had
gone
to
the
theatre
gecko
was
in
the
hands
of
the
police
things
had
got
to
a
terrible
pass
but
our
three
friends
did
their
best
and
were
up
most
of
the
night
so
much
for
la
svengali
début
in
london
the
present
scribe
was
not
present
on
that
memorable
occasion
and
has
written
this
inadequate
and
most
incomplete
description
partly
from
hearsay
and
private
information
partly
from
the
reports
in
the
contemporary
newspapers
should
any
surviving
of
that
lamentable
fiasco
read
these
pages
and
see
any
gross
inaccuracy
in
this
bald
account
of
it
the
will
feel
deeply
obliged
to
the
same
for
any
corrections
or
additions
and
these
will
be
duly
acted
upon
and
gratefully
acknowledged
in
all
subsequent
editions
which
will
be
numerous
no
doubt
on
account
of
the
great
interest
still
felt
in
la
svengali
even
by
those
who
never
saw
or
heard
her
and
they
are
many
and
also
because
the
present
scribe
is
better
qualified
by
his
opportunities
for
the
compiling
of
this
brief
biographical
sketch
than
any
person
now
living
with
the
exception
of
course
of
taffy
and
the
laird
to
whose
kindness
even
more
than
to
his
own
personal
recollections
he
owes
whatever
it
may
contain
of
serious
historical
value
next
morning
they
all
three
went
to
fitzroy
square
little
billee
had
slept
at
taffy
rooms
in
jermyn
street
trilby
seemed
quite
pathetically
glad
to
see
them
again
she
was
dressed
simply
and
plainly
in
black
her
trunks
had
been
sent
from
the
hotel
the
hospital
nurse
was
with
her
the
doctor
had
just
left
he
had
said
that
she
was
suffering
from
some
great
nervous
shock
a
pretty
safe
diagnosis
her
wits
had
apparently
not
come
back
and
she
seemed
in
no
way
to
realize
her
position
ah
what
it
is
to
see
you
again
all
three
it
makes
one
feel
glad
to
be
alive
i
thought
of
many
things
but
never
of
this
never
three
nice
clean
englishmen
all
speaking
english
and
dear
old
friends
ah
tant
ça
le
ciel
i
wonder
i
got
a
word
of
english
left
illustration
nice
clean
englishmen
her
voice
was
so
soft
and
sweet
and
low
that
these
ingenuous
remarks
sounded
like
a
beautiful
song
and
she
made
the
soft
eyes
at
them
all
three
one
after
another
in
her
old
way
and
the
soft
eyes
quickly
filled
with
tears
she
seemed
ill
and
weak
and
worn
out
and
insisted
on
keeping
the
laird
hand
in
hers
what
the
matter
with
svengali
he
must
be
dead
they
all
three
looked
at
each
other
perplexed
ah
he
dead
i
can
see
it
in
your
faces
he
got
sorry
oh
very
sorry
indeed
he
was
always
very
kind
poor
svengali
yes
he
dead
said
taffy
and
gecko
dear
little
gecko
is
he
dead
too
i
saw
him
last
night
he
warmed
my
hands
and
feet
where
were
we
no
gecko
not
dead
but
he
had
to
be
locked
up
for
a
little
while
he
struck
svengali
you
know
you
saw
it
all
i
no
i
never
saw
it
but
i
something
like
it
gecko
with
a
knife
and
people
holding
him
and
svengali
bleeding
on
the
ground
that
was
just
before
svengali
illness
he
cut
himself
in
the
neck
you
know
with
a
rusty
nail
he
told
me
i
wonder
how
but
it
was
wrong
of
gecko
to
strike
him
they
were
such
friends
why
did
he
well
it
was
because
svengali
struck
you
with
his
conductor
wand
when
you
were
rehearsing
struck
you
on
the
fingers
and
made
you
cry
you
remember
struck
made
me
what
you
talking
about
dear
taffy
svengali
never
me
he
was
kindness
itself
always
and
what
should
rehearse
well
the
songs
you
were
to
sing
at
the
theatre
in
the
evening
sing
at
the
theatre
never
sang
at
any
theatre
except
last
night
if
that
big
place
was
a
theatre
and
they
did
seem
to
like
it
take
precious
good
care
never
to
sing
in
a
theatre
again
how
they
howled
and
there
was
svengali
in
the
box
opposite
laughing
at
me
why
was
i
taken
there
and
why
did
that
funny
little
frenchman
in
the
white
waistcoat
ask
me
to
sing
i
know
very
well
i
ca
sing
well
enough
to
sing
in
a
place
like
that
what
a
fool
i
was
it
all
seems
like
a
bad
dream
what
was
it
all
about
it
a
dream
i
wonder
well
but
do
you
remember
singing
at
paris
in
the
salle
des
bashibazoucks
and
at
vienna
petersburg
lots
of
places
what
nonsense
dear
you
thinking
of
some
one
else
never
sang
anywhere
i
been
to
vienna
and
petersburg
but
i
never
there
good
heavens
then
there
was
a
pause
and
our
three
friends
looked
at
her
helplessly
little
billee
said
tell
me
trilby
what
made
you
cut
me
dead
when
i
bowed
to
you
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
you
were
riding
with
svengali
in
that
swell
carriage
never
rode
in
a
swell
carriage
with
svengali
omnibuses
were
more
in
line
you
dreaming
dear
little
billee
you
taking
me
for
somebody
else
and
as
for
my
cutting
why
i
sooner
cut
myself
into
little
pieces
were
you
staying
with
svengali
in
paris
i
really
forget
we
in
paris
oh
yes
of
course
hôtel
bertrand
place
notre
dame
des
victoires
how
long
have
you
been
going
about
with
svengali
oh
months
years
i
forget
i
was
very
ill
he
cured
me
ill
what
was
the
matter
oh
i
was
mad
with
grief
and
pain
in
my
eyes
and
wanted
to
kill
myself
when
i
lost
my
dear
little
jeannot
at
vibraye
i
fancied
i
had
been
careful
enough
with
him
i
was
crazed
do
you
remember
writing
to
me
there
taffy
through
angèle
boisse
such
a
sweet
letter
you
wrote
i
know
it
by
heart
and
you
too
sandy
and
she
kissed
him
i
wonder
where
they
are
your
letters
i
got
nothing
of
my
own
in
the
world
not
even
your
dear
letters
nor
little
billee
such
lots
of
them
illustration
pœna
pede
claudo
well
svengali
used
to
write
to
me
too
and
then
he
got
my
address
from
angèle
when
jeannot
died
i
felt
i
must
kill
myself
or
get
away
from
vibraye
get
away
from
the
people
there
so
when
he
was
buried
i
cut
my
hair
short
and
got
a
workman
cap
and
blouse
and
trousers
and
walked
all
the
way
to
paris
without
saying
anything
to
anybody
i
did
want
anybody
to
know
i
wanted
to
escape
from
svengali
who
wrote
that
he
was
coming
there
to
fetch
me
i
wanted
to
hide
in
paris
when
i
got
there
at
last
it
was
two
in
the
morning
and
i
was
in
dreadful
pain
and
i
lost
all
my
money
thirty
francs
through
a
hole
in
my
besides
i
had
a
row
with
a
carter
in
the
halle
he
thought
i
was
a
man
and
hit
me
and
gave
me
a
black
eye
just
because
i
patted
his
horse
and
fed
it
with
a
carrot
i
been
trying
to
eat
myself
he
was
tipsy
i
think
well
i
looked
over
the
bridge
at
the
river
just
by
the
morgue
and
wanted
to
jump
in
but
the
morgue
sickened
me
so
i
had
the
pluck
svengali
used
to
be
always
talking
about
the
morgue
and
my
going
there
some
day
he
used
to
say
he
come
and
look
at
me
there
and
the
idea
made
me
so
sick
i
could
i
got
bewildered
and
quite
stupid
then
i
went
to
angèle
in
the
rue
des
cloîtres
ste
pétronille
and
waited
about
but
i
had
the
courage
to
ring
so
i
went
to
the
place
anatole
des
arts
and
looked
up
at
the
old
studio
window
and
thought
how
comfortable
it
was
in
there
with
the
big
settee
near
the
stove
and
all
that
and
felt
inclined
to
ring
up
madame
vinard
and
then
i
remembered
little
billee
was
ill
there
and
his
mother
and
sister
were
with
him
angèle
had
written
me
you
know
poor
little
billee
there
he
was
very
ill
so
i
walked
about
the
place
and
up
and
down
the
rue
des
mauvais
ladres
then
i
went
down
the
rue
de
seine
to
the
river
again
and
again
i
had
the
pluck
to
jump
in
besides
there
was
a
sergent
de
ville
who
followed
and
watched
me
and
the
fun
of
it
was
that
i
knew
him
quite
well
and
he
did
know
me
a
bit
it
was
célestin
beaumollet
who
got
so
tipsy
on
christmas
night
do
you
remember
the
tall
one
who
was
pitted
with
the
illustration
the
old
studio
then
i
walked
about
till
near
daylight
then
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
went
to
svengali
in
the
rue
but
he
moved
to
the
rue
des
saints
pères
and
i
went
there
and
found
him
i
did
want
to
a
bit
but
i
could
help
myself
it
was
fate
i
suppose
he
was
very
kind
and
cured
me
almost
directly
and
got
me
coffee
and
the
best
i
ever
tasted
and
a
warm
bath
from
bidet
frères
in
the
rue
savonarole
it
was
heavenly
and
i
slept
for
two
days
and
two
nights
and
then
he
told
me
how
fond
he
was
of
me
and
how
he
would
always
cure
me
and
take
care
of
me
and
marry
me
if
i
would
go
away
with
him
he
said
he
would
devote
his
whole
life
to
me
and
took
a
small
room
for
me
next
to
his
i
stayed
with
him
there
a
week
never
going
out
or
seeing
any
one
mostly
asleep
i
caught
a
chill
he
played
in
two
concerts
and
made
a
lot
of
money
and
then
we
went
away
to
germany
together
and
no
one
was
a
bit
the
wiser
and
he
marry
you
well
no
he
could
poor
fellow
he
already
got
a
wife
living
and
three
children
which
he
declared
were
not
his
they
live
in
elberfeld
in
prussia
she
keeps
a
small
shop
there
he
behaved
very
badly
to
them
but
it
was
not
through
me
he
deserted
them
long
before
but
he
used
to
send
them
plenty
of
money
when
he
got
any
i
made
him
for
i
was
very
sorry
for
her
he
was
always
talking
about
her
and
what
she
said
and
what
she
did
and
imitating
her
saying
her
prayers
and
eating
pickled
cucumber
with
one
hand
and
drinking
schnapps
with
the
other
so
as
not
to
lose
any
time
till
he
made
me
die
of
laughing
he
could
be
very
funny
svengali
though
he
german
poor
dear
and
then
gecko
joined
us
and
marta
who
marta
his
aunt
she
cooked
for
us
and
all
that
she
coming
here
presently
she
sent
word
from
the
hotel
she
very
fond
of
him
poor
marta
poor
gecko
what
they
ever
do
without
svengali
then
what
did
he
do
to
live
oh
he
played
at
concerts
i
suppose
and
all
that
did
you
ever
hear
him
yes
sometimes
marta
took
me
at
the
beginning
you
know
he
was
always
very
much
applauded
he
plays
beautifully
everybody
said
so
did
he
never
try
and
teach
you
to
sing
oh
maïe
aïe
not
he
why
he
always
laughed
when
i
tried
to
sing
and
so
did
marta
and
so
did
gecko
it
made
them
roar
i
used
to
sing
bolt
they
used
to
make
me
just
for
fun
and
go
into
fits
mind
a
scrap
i
had
no
training
you
know
was
there
anybody
else
he
knew
any
other
woman
not
that
know
of
he
always
made
out
he
was
so
fond
of
me
that
he
could
even
at
another
woman
poor
svengali
here
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
again
he
was
always
very
kind
but
i
never
could
be
fond
of
him
in
the
way
he
wished
never
it
made
me
sick
even
to
think
of
once
i
used
to
hate
him
in
paris
in
the
studio
do
you
remember
he
hardly
ever
left
me
and
then
marta
looked
after
me
for
i
always
been
weak
and
ill
and
often
so
languid
that
i
could
hardly
walk
across
the
room
it
was
that
walk
from
vibraye
to
paris
i
never
got
over
it
i
used
to
try
and
do
all
i
could
be
a
daughter
to
him
as
i
be
anything
else
mend
his
things
and
all
that
and
cook
him
little
french
dishes
i
fancy
he
was
very
poor
at
one
time
we
were
always
moving
from
place
to
place
but
i
always
had
the
best
of
everything
he
insisted
on
that
even
if
he
had
to
go
without
himself
it
made
him
quite
unhappy
when
i
would
eat
so
i
used
to
force
myself
then
as
soon
as
i
felt
uneasy
about
things
or
had
any
pain
he
would
say
ma
mignonne
and
i
would
sleep
at
once
for
hours
i
think
and
wake
up
oh
so
tired
and
find
him
kneeling
by
me
always
so
anxious
and
kind
and
marta
and
gecko
and
sometimes
we
had
the
doctor
and
i
was
ill
in
bed
gecko
used
to
dine
and
breakfast
with
us
you
no
idea
what
an
angel
he
is
poor
little
gecko
but
what
a
dreadful
thing
to
strike
svengali
did
he
svengali
taught
him
all
he
knows
and
you
knew
no
one
else
no
other
woman
no
one
that
i
can
remember
except
marta
not
a
soul
and
that
beautiful
dress
you
had
on
last
night
it
is
mine
it
on
the
bed
and
so
the
fur
cloak
they
belong
to
marta
she
got
lots
of
them
lovely
things
silk
satin
velvet
and
lots
of
beautiful
jewels
marta
deals
in
them
and
makes
lots
of
money
i
often
tried
them
on
i
very
easy
to
fit
she
said
being
so
tall
and
thin
and
poor
svengali
would
kneel
down
and
cry
and
kiss
my
hands
and
feet
and
tell
me
i
was
his
goddess
and
empress
and
all
that
which
i
hate
and
marta
used
to
cry
too
and
then
he
would
say
maintenant
dors
ma
mignonne
and
when
i
woke
up
i
was
so
tired
that
i
went
to
sleep
again
on
my
own
account
illustration
maintenant
dors
ma
mignonne
but
he
was
very
patient
oh
dear
me
i
always
been
a
poor
helpless
useless
log
and
burden
to
him
once
i
actually
walked
in
my
sleep
and
woke
up
in
the
at
prague
and
found
an
immense
crowd
and
poor
svengali
bleeding
from
the
forehead
in
a
faint
on
the
ground
he
been
knocked
down
by
a
horse
and
cart
he
told
me
he
got
his
guitar
with
him
i
suppose
he
and
gecko
had
been
playing
somewhere
for
gecko
had
his
fiddle
if
gecko
had
been
there
i
do
know
what
we
should
have
done
you
never
saw
such
queer
people
as
they
were
such
crowds
you
think
they
never
seen
an
englishwoman
before
the
noise
they
made
and
the
things
they
gave
me
some
of
them
went
down
on
their
knees
and
kissed
my
hands
and
the
skirts
of
my
gown
he
was
ill
in
bed
for
a
week
after
that
and
i
nursed
him
and
he
was
very
grateful
poor
svengali
god
knows
felt
grateful
to
for
many
things
tell
me
how
he
died
i
hope
he
had
much
pain
they
told
her
it
was
quite
sudden
from
ah
i
knew
he
had
that
he
was
a
healthy
man
he
used
to
smoke
too
much
marta
used
always
to
be
very
anxious
just
then
marta
came
in
marta
was
a
fat
elderly
jewess
of
rather
a
grotesque
and
ignoble
type
she
seemed
overcome
with
grief
all
but
prostrate
trilby
hugged
and
kissed
her
and
took
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
made
her
sit
down
in
a
big
and
got
her
a
footstool
she
could
speak
a
word
of
anything
but
polish
and
a
little
german
trilby
had
also
picked
up
a
little
german
and
with
this
and
by
means
of
signs
and
no
doubt
through
a
long
intimacy
with
each
other
ways
they
understood
each
other
very
well
she
seemed
a
very
good
old
creature
and
very
fond
of
trilby
but
in
mortal
terror
of
the
three
englishmen
lunch
was
brought
up
for
the
two
women
and
the
nurse
and
our
friends
left
them
promising
to
come
again
that
day
they
were
utterly
bewildered
and
the
laird
would
have
it
that
there
was
another
madame
svengali
somewhere
the
real
one
and
that
trilby
was
a
fraud
and
quite
unconsciously
so
of
course
truth
looked
out
of
her
eyes
as
it
always
had
done
truth
was
in
every
line
of
her
face
the
truth
only
nothing
but
the
truth
could
ever
be
told
in
that
voice
of
velvet
which
rang
as
true
when
she
spoke
as
that
of
any
thrush
or
nightingale
however
rebellious
it
might
be
now
and
forever
perhaps
to
artificial
melodic
laws
and
limitations
and
restraints
the
long
training
it
had
been
subjected
to
had
made
it
a
wonder
a
delight
and
though
she
might
never
sing
another
note
her
mere
speech
would
always
be
more
golden
than
any
silence
whatever
she
might
say
except
on
the
one
particular
point
of
her
singing
she
had
seemed
absolutely
sane
so
at
least
thought
taffy
the
laird
and
little
billee
and
each
thought
to
himself
besides
that
this
last
incarnation
of
trilbyness
was
quite
the
sweetest
most
touching
most
endearing
of
all
they
had
not
failed
to
note
how
rapidly
she
had
aged
now
that
they
had
seen
her
without
her
rouge
and
she
looked
thirty
at
least
she
was
only
her
hands
were
almost
transparent
in
their
waxen
whiteness
delicate
little
frosty
wrinkles
had
gathered
round
her
eyes
there
were
gray
streaks
in
her
hair
all
strength
and
straightness
and
elasticity
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
her
with
the
memory
of
her
endless
triumphs
if
she
really
la
svengali
and
of
her
many
wanderings
from
city
to
city
all
over
europe
it
was
evident
enough
that
the
sudden
stroke
which
had
destroyed
her
power
of
singing
had
left
her
physically
a
wreck
but
she
was
one
of
those
rarely
gifted
beings
who
can
not
look
or
speak
or
even
stir
without
waking
up
and
satisfying
some
vague
longing
that
lies
dormant
in
the
hearts
of
most
of
us
men
and
women
alike
grace
charm
magnetism
whatever
the
nameless
seduction
should
be
called
that
she
possessed
to
such
an
unusual
degree
she
had
lost
none
of
it
when
she
lost
her
high
spirits
her
buoyant
health
and
energy
her
wits
tuneless
and
insane
she
was
more
of
a
siren
than
ever
a
quite
unconscious
siren
without
any
guile
who
appealed
to
the
heart
all
the
more
directly
and
irresistibly
that
she
could
no
longer
stir
the
passions
all
this
was
keenly
felt
by
all
three
each
in
his
different
way
by
taffy
and
little
billee
especially
all
her
past
life
was
forgiven
her
sins
of
omission
and
commission
and
whatever
might
be
her
fate
recovery
madness
disease
or
death
the
care
of
her
till
she
died
or
recovered
should
be
the
principal
business
of
their
lives
both
had
loved
her
all
three
perhaps
one
had
been
loved
by
her
as
passionately
as
purely
as
unselfishly
as
any
man
could
wish
to
be
loved
and
in
some
extraordinary
manner
had
recovered
after
many
years
at
the
mere
sudden
sight
and
sound
of
her
his
lost
share
in
our
common
inheritance
the
power
to
love
and
all
its
joy
and
sorrow
without
which
he
had
found
life
not
worth
living
though
he
had
possessed
every
other
gift
and
blessing
in
such
abundance
oh
circe
poor
circe
dear
circe
divine
enchantress
that
you
were
he
said
to
himself
in
his
excitable
way
a
mere
look
from
your
eyes
a
mere
note
of
your
heavenly
voice
has
turned
a
poor
miserable
callous
brute
back
into
a
man
again
and
i
will
never
forget
it
never
and
now
that
a
still
worse
trouble
than
mine
has
befallen
you
you
shall
always
be
first
in
my
thoughts
till
the
end
and
taffy
felt
pretty
much
the
same
though
he
was
not
by
way
of
talking
to
himself
so
eloquent
about
things
as
little
billee
as
they
lunched
they
read
the
accounts
of
the
previous
evening
events
in

about
the
famous
but
unhappy
singer
who
had

so
suddenly
widowed
and
struck
down
in
the
midst
of
her
glory
all
these
accounts
were
more
or
less
correct
in

paper
it
was
mentioned
that
madame
svengali
was
under
the
roof
and
care
of
william
bagot
the
painter
in

the

taffy
was
allowed
to
see

who
was
remanded
till
the
result
of
the
should
be
made
public
but
beyond
inquiring
most
anxiously
and
minutely
after
trilby
and
betraying
the
most
passionate
concern
for
her
he
would
say
nothing
and
seemed
indifferent
as
to
his
own
fate
when
they
went
to
fitzroy
square
late
in
the
afternoon
they
found
that
many
people
musical
literary
fashionable
and
otherwise
and
many
foreigners
had
called
to
inquire
after
madame
svengali
but
no
one
had
been
admitted
to
see
her
godwin
was
much
elated
by
the
importance
of
her
new
lodger
trilby
had
been
writing
to
angèle
boisse
at
her
old
address
in
the
rue
des
cloîtres
ste
pétronille
in
the
hope
that
this
letter
would
find
her
still
there
she
was
anxious
to
go
back
and
be
a
de
with
her
friend
it
was
a
kind
of
nostalgia
for
paris
the
quartier
latin
her
clean
old
trade
this
project
our
three
heroes
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
discuss
with
her
just
yet
she
seemed
quite
unfit
for
work
of
any
kind
the
doctor
who
had
seen
her
again
had
been
puzzled
by
her
strange
physical
weakness
and
wished
for
a
consultation
with
some
special
authority
little
billee
who
was
intimate
with
most
of
the
great
physicians
wrote
about
her
to
sir
oliver
calthorpe
she
seemed
to
find
a
deep
happiness
in
being
with
her
three
old
friends
and
talked
and
listened
with
all
her
old
eagerness
and
geniality
and
much
of
her
old
gayety
in
spite
of
her
strange
and
sorrowful
position
but
for
this
it
was
impossible
to
realize
that
her
brain
was
affected
in
the
slightest
degree
except
when
some
reference
was
made
to
her
singing
and
this
seemed
to
annoy
and
irritate
her
as
though
she
were
being
made
fun
of
the
whole
of
her
marvellous
musical
career
and
everything
connected
with
it
had
been
clean
wiped
out
of
her
recollection
she
was
very
anxious
to
get
into
other
quarters
that
little
billee
should
suffer
no
inconvenience
and
they
promised
to
take
rooms
for
her
and
marta
on
the
morrow
they
told
her
cautiously
all
about
svengali
and
gecko
she
was
deeply
concerned
but
betrayed
no
such
poignant
anguish
as
might
have
been
expected
the
thought
of
gecko
troubled
her
most
and
she
showed
much
anxiety
as
to
what
might
befall
him
next
day
she
moved
with
marta
to
some
lodgings
in
charlotte
street
where
everything
was
made
as
comfortable
for
them
as
possible
sir
oliver
saw
her
with
thorne
the
doctor
who
was
attending
her
and
sir
jacob
wilcox
sir
oliver
took
the
greatest
interest
in
her
case
both
for
her
sake
and
his
friend
little
billee
also
his
own
for
he
was
charmed
with
her
he
saw
her
three
times
in
the
course
of
the
week
but
could
not
say
for
certain
what
was
the
matter
with
her
beyond
taking
the
very
gravest
view
of
her
condition
for
all
he
could
advise
or
prescribe
her
weakness
and
physical
prostration
increased
rapidly
through
no
cause
he
could
discover
her
insanity
was
not
enough
to
account
for
it
she
lost
weight
daily
she
seemed
to
be
wasting
and
fading
away
from
sheer
general
atrophy
two
or
three
times
he
took
her
and
marta
for
a
drive
on
one
of
these
occasions
as
they
went
down
charlotte
street
she
saw
a
shop
with
transparent
french
blinds
in
the
window
and
through
them
some
french
women
with
neat
white
caps
ironing
it
was
a
french
de
and
the
sight
of
it
interested
and
excited
her
so
much
that
she
must
needs
insist
on
being
put
down
and
on
going
into
it
je
voudrais
bien
parler
à
la
patronne
si
ça
ne
la
dérange
pas
she
said
illustration
a
fair
blanchisseuse
de
fin
the
patronne
a
genial
parisian
was
much
astonished
to
hear
a
great
french
lady
in
costly
garments
evidently
a
person
of
fashion
and
importance
applying
to
her
rather
humbly
for
employment
in
the
business
and
showing
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
work
and
of
the
parisian
colloquial
dialect
marta
managed
to
catch
the
patronne
eye
and
tapped
her
own
forehead
significantly
and
sir
oliver
nodded
so
the
good
woman
humored
the
great
lady
fancy
and
promised
her
abundance
of
employment
whenever
she
should
want
it
employment
poor
trilby
was
hardly
strong
enough
to
walk
back
to
the
carriage
and
this
was
her
last
outing
but
this
little
adventure
had
filled
her
with
hope
and
good
spirits
for
she
had
as
yet
received
no
answer
from
angèle
boisse
who
was
in
marseilles
and
had
begun
to
realize
how
dreary
the
quartier
latin
would
be
without
jeannot
without
angèle
without
the
trois
angliches
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
she
was
not
allowed
to
see
any
of
the
strangers
who
came
and
made
kind
inquiries
this
her
doctors
had
strictly
forbidden
any
reference
to
music
or
singing
irritated
her
beyond
measure
she
would
say
to
marta
in
bad
german
tell
them
marta
what
nonsense
it
is
they
are
taking
me
for
another
they
are
mad
they
are
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
me
and
marta
would
betray
great
uneasiness
almost
terror
when
she
was
appealed
to
in
this
way

svengali
had
died
from
the
cut
he
had
received
from
gecko
had
not
apparently
as
far
as
the
verdict
of
a
coroner
inquest
could
be
trusted
had
any
effect
in
aggravating
his
malady
or
hastening
his
death
but
gecko
was
sent
for
trial
at
the
old
bailey
and
sentenced
to
hard
labor
for
six
months
a
sentence
which
if
i
remember
aright
gave
rise
to
much
comment
at
the
time
taffy
saw
him
again
but
with
no
better
result
than
before
he
chose
to
preserve
an
obstinate
silence
on
his
relations
with
the
svengalis
and
their
relations
with
each
other
when
he
was
told
how
hopelessly
ill
and
insane
madame
svengali
was
he
shed
a
few
tears
and
said
ah

je
tant

and
not
another
word
was
to
be
got
out
of
him
it
took
some
time
to
settle
svengali
affairs
after
his
death
no
will
was
found
his
old
mother
came
over
from
germany
and
two
of
his
sisters
but
no
wife
the
comic
wife
and
the
three
children
and
the
shop
in
elberfeld
had
been
humorous
inventions
of
his
own
a
kind
of
harris
he
left
three
thousand
pounds
every
penny
of
which
and
of
far
larger
sums
that
he
had
spent
had
been
earned
by
la
svengali
but
nothing
came
to
trilby
of
this
nothing
but
the
clothes
and
jewels
he
had
given
her
and
in
this
respect
he
had
been
lavish
enough
and
there
were
countless
costly
gifts
from
emperors
kings
great
people
of
all
kinds
trilby
was
under
the
impression
that
all
these
belonged
to
marta
marta
behaved
admirably
she
seemed
bound
hand
and
foot
to
trilby
by
a
kind
of
slavish
adoration
as
that
of
a
plain
old
mother
for
a
brilliant
and
beautiful
but
dying
child
it
soon
became
evident
that
whatever
her
disease
might
be
trilby
had
but
a
very
short
time
to
live
she
was
soon
too
weak
even
to
be
taken
out
in
a
and
remained
all
day
in
her
large
with
marta
and
there
to
her
great
and
only
joy
she
received
her
three
old
friends
every
afternoon
and
gave
them
coffee
and
made
them
smoke
cigarettes
of
caporal
as
of
old
and
their
hearts
were
daily
harrowed
as
they
watched
her
rapid
decline
day
by
day
she
grew
more
beautiful
in
their
eyes
in
spite
of
her
increasing
pallor
and
emaciation
her
skin
was
so
pure
and
white
and
delicate
and
the
bones
of
her
face
so
admirable
illustration
a
throne
in
bohemia
her
eyes
recovered
all
their
old
humorous
brightness
when
les
trois
angliches
were
with
her
and
the
expression
of
her
face
was
so
wistful
and
tender
for
all
her
playfulness
so
full
of
eager
clinging
to
existence
and
to
them
that
they
felt
the
memory
of
it
would
haunt
them
forever
and
be
the
sweetest
and
saddest
memory
of
their
lives
her
quick
though
feeble
gestures
full
of
reminiscences
of
the
vigorous
and
lively
girl
they
had
known
a
few
years
back
sent
waves
of
pity
through
them
and
pure
brotherly
love
and
the
incomparable
tones
and
changes
and
modulations
of
her
voice
as
she
chatted
and
laughed
bewitched
them
almost
as
much
as
when
she
had
sung

so

like

and
so
singularly

vue
à

quatre
tempéraments
these
afternoons
were
probably
the
happiest
poor
trilby
had
ever
spent
in
her
life
with
these
dear
people
round
her
speaking
the
language
she
loved
talking
of
old
times
and
jolly
paris
days
she
never
thought
of
the
morrow
but
later
at
night
in
the
small
hours
she
would
wake
up
with
a
start
from
some
dream
full
of
tender
and
blissful
recollection
and
suddenly
realize
her
own
mischance
and
feel
the
icy
hand
of
that
which
was
to
come
before
many
morrows
were
over
and
taste
the
bitterness
of
death
so
keenly
that
she
longed
to
scream
out
loud
and
get
up
and
walk
up
and
down
and
wring
her
hands
at
the
dreadful
thought
of
parting
forever
but
she
lay
motionless
and
mum
as
a
poor
little
frightened
mouse
in
a
trap
for
fear
of
waking
up
the
good
old
tired
marta
who
was
snoring
at
her
side
and
in
an
hour
or
two
the
bitterness
would
pass
away
the
creeps
and
the
horrors
and
the
stoical
spirit
of
resignation
would
steal
over
her
the
balm
the
blessed
calm
and
all
her
old
bravery
would
come
back
and
then
she
would
sink
into
sleep
again
and
dream
more
blissfully
than
ever
till
the
good
marta
woke
her
with
a
motherly
kiss
and
a
fragrant
cup
of
coffee
and
she
would
find
feeble
as
she
was
and
doomed
as
she
felt
herself
to
be
that
joy
cometh
of
a
morning
and
life
was
still
sweet
for
her
with
yet
a
whole
day
to
look
forward
to
one
day
she
was
deeply
moved
at
receiving
a
visit
from
bagot
who
at
little
billee
earnest
desire
had
come
all
the
way
from
devonshire
to
see
her
as
the
graceful
little
lady
came
in
pale
and
trembling
all
over
trilby
rose
from
her
chair
to
receive
her
and
rather
timidly
put
out
her
hand
and
smiled
in
a
frightened
manner
neither
could
speak
for
a
second
bagot
stood
by
the
door
gazing
with
all
her
heart
in
her
eyes
at
the
so
terribly
altered
trilby
the
girl
she
had
once
so
dreaded
trilby
who
seemed
also
bereft
of
motion
and
whose
face
and
lips
were
ashen
exclaimed
i
afraid
i
have
quite
kept
my
promise
to
you
after
all
but
things
have
turned
out
so
differently
anyhow
you
need
have
any
fear
of
me
illustration
my
poor
girl
my
poor
girl
at
the
mere
sound
of
that
voice
bagot
who
was
as
impulsive
emotional
and
unregulated
as
her
son
rushed
forward
crying
oh
my
poor
girl
my
poor
girl
and
caught
her
in
her
arms
and
kissed
and
caressed
her
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
forced
her
back
into
her
chair
hugging
her
as
if
she
were
a
child
i
love
you
now
as
much
as
i
always
admired
you
pray
believe
it
oh
how
kind
of
you
to
say
that
said
trilby
her
own
eyes
filling
i
not
at
all
the
dangerous
or
designing
person
you
thought
i
knew
quite
well
i
was
a
proper
person
to
marry
your
son
all
the
time
and
told
him
so
again
and
again
it
was
very
stupid
of
me
to
say
yes
at
last
i
was
miserable
directly
after
i
assure
you
somehow
i
help
myself
i
was
driven
oh
do
talk
of
that
do
talk
of
that
you
never
been
to
blame
in
any
way
i
long
known
it
i
been
full
of
remorse
you
been
in
my
thoughts
always
night
and
day
forgive
a
poor
jealous
mother
as
if
man
could
help
loving
you
or
any
woman
either
forgive
me
oh
bagot
forgive
what
a
funny
idea
but
anyhow
forgiven
and
that
all
i
care
for
now
i
was
very
fond
of
your
son
as
fond
as
could
be
i
am
now
but
in
quite
a
different
sort
of
way
you
know
the
sort
of
way
must
be
i
fancy
there
was
never
another
like
him
that
i
ever
met
anywhere
you
be
so
proud
of
him
who
would
good
enough
for
him
i
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
be
his
servant
his
humble
servant
i
used
to
tell
him
so
but
he
would
hear
of
it
he
was
much
too
kind
he
always
thought
of
others
before
himself
and
oh
how
rich
and
famous
he
become
heard
all
about
it
and
it
did
me
good
it
does
me
more
good
to
think
of
than
anything
else
far
more
than
if
i
were
to
be
ever
so
rich
and
famous
myself
i
can
tell
you
this
from
la
svengali
whose
overpowering
fame
so
utterly
forgotten
by
herself
was
still
ringing
all
over
europe
whose
lamentable
illness
and
approaching
death
were
being
mourned
and
discussed
and
commented
upon
in
every
capital
of
the
civilized
world
as
one
distressing
bulletin
appeared
after
another
she
might
have
been
a
royal
personage
bagot
knew
of
course
the
strange
form
her
insanity
had
taken
and
made
no
allusion
to
the
flood
of
thoughts
that
rushed
through
her
own
brain
as
she
listened
to
this
towering
goddess
of
song
this
poor
mad
queen
of
the
nightingales
humbly
gloating
over
her
son
success
poor
bagot
had
just
come
from
little
billee
in
fitzroy
square
close
by
there
she
had
seen
taffy
in
a
corner
of
little
studio
laboriously
answering
endless
letters
and
telegrams
from
all
parts
of
europe
for
the
good
taffy
had
constituted
himself
secretary
and
unknown
to
her
of
course
and
this
was
no
sinecure
though
he
liked
it
putting
aside
the
numerous
people
he
had
to
see
and
be
interviewed
by
there
were
kind
inquiries
and
messages
of
condolence
and
sympathy
from
nearly
all
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
through
their
chamberlains
applications
for
help
from
unsuccessful
musical
strugglers
all
over
the
world
to
the
successful
one
beautiful
letters
from
great
and
famous
people
musical
or
otherwise
disinterested
offers
of
service
interested
proposals
for
engagements
when
the
present
trouble
should
be
over
beggings
for
an
interview
from
famous
impresarios
to
obtain
which
no
distance
would
be
thought
too
great
etc
it
was
endless
in
english
french
german
italian
in
languages
quite
incomprehensible
many
letters
had
to
remain
unanswered
taffy
took
an
almost
malicious
pleasure
in
explaining
all
this
to
bagot
then
there
was
a
constant
rolling
of
carriages
up
to
the
door
and
a
thundering
of

billee

and

of

wishes
to
know
everybody
wishes
to
know
if
there
is
any
better
news
of
madame
svengali
these
were
small
things
truly
but
bagot
was
a
small
person
from
a
small
village
in
devonshire
and
one
whose
heart
and
eye
had
hitherto
been
filled
by
no
larger
image
than
that
of
little
billee
and
little
billee
fame
as
she
now
discovered
for
the
first
time
did
not
quite
fill
the
entire
universe
and
she
must
be
too
much
blamed
if
all
these
obvious
signs
of
a
colossal
celebrity
impressed
and
even
awed
her
a
little
madame
svengali
why
this
was
the
beautiful
girl
whom
she
remembered
so
well
whom
she
had
so
grandly
discarded
with
a
word
and
who
had
accepted
her
congé
so
meekly
in
a
minute
whom
indeed
she
had
been
cursing
in
her
heart
for
years
because
because
what
poor
bagot
felt
herself
turn
hot
and
red
all
over
and
humbled
herself
to
the
very
dust
and
almost
forgot
that
she
had
been
in
the
right
after
all
and
that
la
grande
trilby
was
certainly
no
fit
match
for
her
son
so
she
went
quite
humbly
to
see
trilby
and
found
a
poor
pathetic
mad
creature
still
more
humble
than
herself
who
still
apologized
for
for
what
a
poor
pathetic
mad
creature
who
had
clean
forgotten
that
she
was
the
greatest
singer
in
all
the
world
one
of
the
greatest
artists
that
had
ever
lived
but
who
remembered
with
shame
and
contrition
that
she
had
once
taken
the
liberty
of
yielding
after
endless
pressure
and
repeated
disinterested
refusals
of
her
own
and
out
of
sheer
irresistible
affection
to
the
passionate
pleadings
of
a
little
obscure
art
student
a
mere
boy
no
better
off
than
herself
just
as
penniless
and
insignificant
a
nobody
but
the
son
of
bagot
all
due
sense
of
proportion
died
out
of
the
poor
lady
as
she
remembered
and
realized
all
this
and
then
trilby
pathetic
beauty
so
touching
so
winning
in
its
rapid
decay
the
nameless
charm
of
look
and
voice
and
manner
that
was
her
special
apanage
and
which
her
malady
and
singular
madness
had
only
increased
her
childlike
simplicity
her
transparent
forgetfulness
of
self
all
these
so
fascinated
and
entranced
bagot
whose
quick
susceptibility
to
such
impressions
was
just
as
keen
as
her
son
that
she
very
soon
found
herself
all
but
worshipping
this
lily
for
so
she
called
her
in
her
own
mind
quite
forgetting
or
affecting
to
forget
on
what
very
questionable
soil
the
lily
had
been
reared
and
through
what
strange
vicissitudes
of
evil
and
corruption
it
had
managed
to
grow
so
tall
and
white
and
fragrant
oh
strange
compelling
power
of
weakness
and
grace
and
prettiness
combined
and
sweet
sincere
unconscious
natural
manners
not
to
speak
of
fame
for
bagot
was
just
a
shrewd
little
conventional
british
country
matron
of
the
good
upper
type
bristling
all
over
with
provincial
proprieties
and
respectabilities
a
philistine
of
the
philistines
in
spite
of
her
artistic
instincts
one
who
for
years
had
rather
unjustly
thought
of
trilby
as
a
wanton
and
perilous
siren
an
unchaste
and
unprincipled
and
most
dangerous
daughter
of
heth
and
the
special
enemy
of
her
house
and
here
she
was
like
all
the
rest
of
us
monads
and
nomads
and
bohemians
just
sitting
at
trilby
feet
a
a
figure
model
and
heaven
knows
what
besides
and
she
had
never
even
heard
her
sing
it
was
truly
comical
to
see
and
hear
bagot
did
not
go
back
to
devonshire
she
remained
in
fitzroy
square
at
her
son
and
spent
most
of
her
time
with
trilby
doing
and
devising
all
kinds
of
things
to
distract
and
amuse
her
and
lead
her
thoughts
gently
to
heaven
and
soften
for
her
the
coming
end
of
all
trilby
had
a
way
of
saying
and
especially
of
looking
thank
you
that
made
one
wish
to
do
as
many
things
for
her
as
one
could
if
only
to
make
her
say
and
look
it
again
and
she
had
retained
much
of
her
old
quaint
and
amusing
manner
of
telling
things
and
had
much
to
tell
still
left
of
her
wandering
life
although
there
were
so
many
strange
lapses
in
her
powers
of
memory
gaps
which
if
they
could
only
have
been
filled
up
would
have
been
full
of
such
surpassing
interest
then
she
was
never
tired
of
talking
and
hearing
of
little
billee
and
that
was
a
subject
of
which
bagot
could
never
tire
either
then
there
were
the
recollections
of
her
childhood
one
day
in
a
drawer
bagot
came
upon
a
faded
daguerreotype
of
a
woman
in
a
tam
o
shanter
with
a
face
so
sweet
and
beautiful
and
that
it
almost
took
her
breath
away
it
was
trilby
mother
who
and
what
was
your
mother
trilby
ah
poor
mamma
said
trilby
and
she
looked
at
the
portrait
a
long
time
ah
she
was
ever
so
much
prettier
than
that
mamma
was
once
a
demoiselle
de
comptoir
that
a
you
know
at
the
montagnards
écossais
in
the
rue
du
paradis
poissonnière
a
place
where
men
used
to
drink
and
smoke
without
sitting
down
that
was
unfortunate
was
it
papa
loved
her
with
all
his
heart
although
of
course
she
was
his
equal
they
were
married
at
the
embassy
in
the
rue
du
faubourg
honoré
illustration
poor
mamma
she
was
ever
so
much
prettier
than
that
parents
were
married
at
all
her
mother
was
the
daughter
of
a
boatman
on
loch
ness
near
a
place
called
drumnadrockit
but
her
father
was
the
honorable
colonel
desmond
he
was
related
to
all
sorts
of
great
people
in
england
and
ireland
he
behaved
very
badly
to
my
grandmother
and
to
poor
mamma
his
own
daughter
deserted
them
both
not
very
of
him
it
and
that
all
i
know
about
him
and
then
she
went
on
to
tell
of
the
home
in
paris
that
might
have
been
so
happy
but
for
her
father
passion
for
drink
of
her
parents
deaths
and
little
jeannot
and
so
forth
and
bagot
was
much
moved
and
interested
by
these
naïve
revelations
which
accounted
in
a
measure
for
so
much
that
seemed
unaccountable
in
this
extraordinary
woman
who
thus
turned
out
to
be
a
kind
of
cousin
though
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
blanket
to
no
less
a
person
than
the
famous
duchess
of
towers
with
what
joy
would
that
ever
kind
and
gracious
lady
have
taken
poor
trilby
to
her
bosom
had
she
only
known
she
had
once
been
all
the
way
from
paris
to
vienna
merely
to
hear
her
sing
but
unfortunately
the
svengalis
had
just
left
for
petersburg
and
she
had
her
long
journey
for
nothing
bagot
brought
her
many
good
books
and
read
them
to
her
cummings
on
the
approaching
end
of
the
world
and
other
works
of
a
like
comforting
tendency
for
those
who
are
just
about
to
leave
it
the
sweet
little
tracts
and
what
not
trilby
was
so
grateful
that
she
listened
with
much
patient
attention
only
now
and
then
a
faint
gleam
of
amusement
would
steal
over
her
face
and
her
lips
would
almost
form
themselves
to
ejaculate
oh
maïe
aïe
then
bagot
as
a
reward
for
such
winning
docility
would
read
her
and
that
was
heavenly
indeed
but
the
best
of
all
was
for
trilby
to
look
over
john
leech
of
life
and
just
out
she
had
never
seen
any
drawings
of
leech
before
except
now
and
then
in
an
occasional
that
turned
up
in
the
studio
in
paris
and
they
never
palled
upon
her
and
taught
her
more
of
the
aspect
of
english
life
the
life
she
loved
than
any
book
she
had
ever
read
she
laughed
and
laughed
and
it
was
almost
as
sweet
to
listen
to
as
if
she
were
vocalizing
the
quick
part
in
impromptu
one
day
she
said
her
lips
trembling
i
ca
make
out
why
you
so
wonderfully
kind
to
me
bagot
i
hope
you
have
not
forgotten
who
and
what
i
am
and
what
my
story
is
i
hope
you
have
forgotten
that
i
not
a
respectable
woman
oh
my
dear
child
do
ask
me
i
only
know
that
you
are
you
and
i
am
i
and
that
is
enough
for
me
you
my
poor
gentle
patient
suffering
daughter
whatever
else
you
are
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
i
feel
sure
but
there
i
misjudged
you
so
and
been
so
unjust
that
i
would
give
worlds
to
make
you
some
amends
besides
i
should
be
just
as
fond
of
you
if
you
committed
a
murder
i
really
believe
you
so
strange
you
irresistible
did
you
ever
in
all
your
life
meet
anybody
that
fond
of
you
trilby
eyes
moistened
with
tender
pleasure
at
such
a
pretty
compliment
then
after
a
few
minutes
thought
she
said
with
engaging
candor
and
quite
simply
no
i
ca
say
i
ever
did
that
i
can
think
of
just
now
but
i
forgotten
such
lots
of
people
one
day
bagot
told
trilby
that
her
thomas
bagot
would
much
like
to
come
and
talk
to
her
was
that
the
gentleman
who
came
with
you
to
the
studio
in
paris
yes
why
he
a
clergyman
is
he
what
does
he
want
to
come
and
talk
to
about
ah
my
dear
child
said
bagot
her
eyes
filling
trilby
was
thoughtful
for
a
while
and
then
said
i
going
to
die
i
suppose
oh
yes
oh
yes
there
no
mistake
about
that
dear
trilby
we
are
all
in
the
hands
of
an
almighty
merciful
god
and
the
tears
rolled
down
bagot
cheeks
after
a
long
pause
during
which
she
gazed
out
of
the
window
trilby
said
in
an
abstracted
kind
of
way
as
though
she
were
talking
to
herself
après
tout
pas
déjà
si
raide
de
claquer
ai
tant
vus
qui
ont
passé
par
la
au
bout
du
fossé
la
culbute
ma
foi
what
are
you
saying
to
yourself
in
french
trilby
your
french
is
so
difficult
to
understand
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
thinking
it
not
so
difficult
to
die
after
all
i
seen
such
lots
of
people
do
it
i
nursed
them
you
know
papa
and
mamma
and
jeannot
and
angèle
boisse
and
a
poor
casseur
de
pierres
colin
maigret
who
lived
in
the
impasse
des
taupes
germain
he
been
run
over
by
an
omnibus
in
the
rue
vaugirard
and
had
to
have
both
his
legs
cut
off
just
above
the
knee
they
none
of
them
seemed
to
mind
dying
a
bit
they
were
a
bit
afraid
not
poor
people
do
think
much
of
death
rich
people
should
either
they
should
be
taught
when
they
quite
young
to
laugh
at
it
and
despise
it
like
the
chinese
the
chinese
die
of
laughing
just
as
their
heads
are
being
cut
off
and
cheat
the
executioner
it
all
in
the
day
work
and
we
all
in
the
same
boat
so
who
afraid
dying
is
not
all
my
poor
child
are
you
prepared
to
meet
your
maker
face
to
face
have
you
ever
thought
about
god
and
the
possible
wrath
to
come
if
you
should
die
unrepentant
oh
but
i
i
been
repenting
all
my
life
besides
be
no
wrath
for
any
of
us
not
even
the
worst
y
aura
amnistie
générale
papa
told
me
so
and
he
been
a
clergyman
like
thomas
bagot
i
often
think
about
god
i
very
fond
of
him
one
have
something
perfect
to
look
up
to
and
be
fond
of
even
if
it
only
an
idea
though
some
people
do
even
believe
he
exists
le
père
martin
did
but
of
course
was
only
a
chiffonnier
and
does
count
one
day
though
durien
the
sculptor
who
very
clever
and
a
very
good
fellow
indeed
said
trilby
i
very
much
afraid
he
does
really
exist
le
bon
dieu
most
unfortunately
for
for
i
him
i
never
do
a
piece
of
work
without
thinking
how
nice
it
would
be
if
i
could
only
please
with
it
and
i
often
thought
myself
how
heavenly
it
must
be
to
be
able
to
paint
or
sculpt
or
make
music
or
write
beautiful
poetry
for
that
very
reason
why
once
on
a
very
hot
afternoon
we
were
sitting
a
lot
of
us
in
the
outside
la
mère
martin
shop
drinking
coffee
with
an
old
invalide
called
bastide
lendormi
one
of
the
vieille
garde
who
only
got
one
leg
and
one
arm
and
one
eye
and
everybody
was
very
fond
of
him
well
a
model
called
mimi
la
salope
came
out
of
the
opposite
and
père
martin
called
out
to
her
to
come
and
sit
down
and
gave
her
a
cup
of
coffee
and
asked
her
to
sing
she
sang
a
song
of
béranger
about
napoleon
the
great
in
which
it
says
de
lui
grandmère
grandmère
de
lui
i
suppose
she
sang
it
very
well
for
it
made
old
bastide
lendormi
cry
and
when
père
martin
him
about
it
he
said
égal
to
sing
like
that
is
illustration
sing
like
that
is
and
then
i
thought
how
lovely
it
would
be
if
could
only
sing
like
mimi
la
salope
and
i
thought
so
ever
since
just
to
trilby
if
could
only
sing
like
oh
but
never
mind
i
forgot
tell
me
trilby
do
you
ever
pray
to
him
as
other
people
pray
pray
to
him
well
no
not
often
not
in
words
and
on
my
knees
and
with
my
hands
together
you
know
praying
very
often
do
you
think
so
and
so
being
sorry
and
ashamed
when
one
done
a
mean
thing
and
glad
when
one
resisted
a
temptation
and
grateful
when
it
a
fine
day
and
one
enjoying
one
self
without
hurting
any
one
else
what
is
it
but
praying
when
you
try
and
bear
up
after
losing
all
you
cared
to
live
for
and
very
good
praying
too
there
can
be
prayers
without
words
just
as
well
as
songs
i
suppose
and
svengali
used
to
say
that
songs
without
words
are
the
best
and
then
it
seems
mean
to
be
always
asking
for
things
besides
you
do
get
them
any
the
faster
that
way
and
that
shows
la
mère
martin
used
to
be
always
praying
and
père
martin
used
always
to
laugh
at
her
yet
he
always
seemed
to
get
the
things
wanted
oftenest
prayed
once
very
hard
indeed
i
prayed
for
jeannot
not
to
die
well
but
how
do
you
trilby
if
you
do
not
humble
yourself
and
pray
for
forgiveness
on
your
knees
oh
well
i
do
exactly
know
look
here
bagot
i
tell
you
the
lowest
and
meanest
thing
i
ever
did
bagot
felt
a
little
nervous
i
promised
to
take
jeannot
on
to
philippe
du
roule
to
hear
bergamot
but
durien
that
the
sculptor
you
know
asked
me
to
go
with
him
to
germain
where
there
was
a
fair
or
something
and
with
mathieu
who
was
a
student
in
law
and
a
certain
victorine
letellier
who
who
was
mathieu
mistress
in
fact
and
i
went
on
sunday
morning
to
tell
jeannot
that
i
could
take
him
he
cried
so
dreadfully
that
i
thought
i
give
up
the
others
and
take
him
to
philippe
as
i
promised
but
then
durien
and
mathieu
and
victorine
drove
up
and
waited
outside
and
so
i
did
take
him
and
went
with
them
and
i
did
enjoy
anything
all
day
and
was
miserable
they
were
in
an
open
carriage
with
two
horses
it
was
mathieu
treat
and
jeannot
might
have
ridden
on
the
box
by
the
coachman
without
being
in
anybody
way
but
i
was
afraid
they
did
want
him
as
they
say
anything
and
so
i
did
dare
ask
and
jeannot
saw
us
drive
away
and
i
look
back
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
when
we
were
to
germain
durien
said
a
pity
you
did
bring
jeannot
and
they
were
all
sorry
i
had
it
was
six
or
seven
years
ago
and
i
really
believe
i
thought
of
it
almost
every
day
and
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
the
night
ah
and
when
jeannot
was
dying
and
when
he
was
dead
the
remembrance
of
that
and
if
not
repenting
i
do
know
what
is
oh
trilby
what
nonsense
nothing
good
heavens
putting
off
a
small
child
i
thinking
of
far
worse
things
when
you
were
in
the
quartier
latin
you
know
sitting
to
painters
and
sculptors
surely
so
attractive
as
you
are
oh
yes
i
know
what
you
mean
it
was
horrid
and
i
was
frightfully
ashamed
of
myself
and
it
was
amusing
a
bit
was
till
i
met
your
son
and
taffy
and
dear
sandy
mcalister
but
then
it
deceiving
or
disappointing
anybody
or
hurting
their
feelings
it
was
only
hurting
myself
besides
all
that
sort
of
thing
in
women
is
punished
severely
enough
down
here
god
knows
unless
one
a
russian
empress
like
catherine
the
great
or
a
grande
dame
like
lots
of
them
or
a
great
genius
like
madame
rachel
or
george
sand
illustration
remembrance
of
that
why
if
it
had
been
for
that
and
sitting
for
the
figure
i
should
have
felt
myself
good
enough
to
marry
your
son
i
was
only
a
blanchisseuse
de
fin
you
said
so
yourself
and
i
should
have
made
him
a
good
wife
of
that
i
feel
sure
he
wanted
to
live
all
his
life
at
barbizon
and
paint
you
know
and
did
care
for
society
in
the
least
anyhow
i
should
have
been
equal
to
such
a
life
as
that
lots
of
their
wives
are
blanchisseuses
over
there
or
people
of
that
sort
and
they
get
on
very
well
indeed
and
nobody
troubles
about
it
so
i
think
i
been
pretty
well
punished
richly
as
i
deserved
to
trilby
have
you
ever
been
confirmed
i
forget
i
fancy
not
oh
dear
oh
dear
and
do
you
know
about
our
blessed
saviour
and
the
atonement
and
the
incarnation
and
the
resurrection
oh
yes
i
to
at
least
i
used
to
have
to
learn
the
catechism
on
sundays
mamma
made
me
whatever
her
faults
and
mistakes
were
poor
mamma
was
always
very
particular
about
it
all
seemed
very
complicated
but
papa
told
me
not
to
bother
too
much
about
it
but
to
be
good
he
said
that
god
would
make
it
all
right
for
us
somehow
in
the
end
all
of
us
and
that
seems
sensible
it
he
told
me
to
be
good
and
not
to
mind
what
priests
and
clergymen
tell
us
he
been
a
clergyman
himself
and
knew
all
about
it
he
said
i
have
been
very
good
there
not
much
doubt
about
that
afraid
but
god
knows
i
repented
often
enough
and
sore
enough
i
do
now
but
i
rather
glad
to
die
i
think
and
not
a
bit
afraid
not
a
scrap
i
believe
in
poor
papa
though
he
so
unfortunate
he
was
the
cleverest
man
i
ever
knew
and
the
best
except
taffy
and
the
laird
and
your
dear
son
there
be
no
hell
for
any
of
us
he
told
me
so
except
what
we
make
for
ourselves
and
each
other
down
here
and
that
bad
enough
for
anything
he
told
me
that
was
responsible
for
me
he
often
said
so
and
that
mamma
was
too
and
his
parents
for
and
his
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
for
and
so
on
up
to
noah
and
ever
so
far
beyond
and
god
for
us
all
he
told
me
always
to
think
of
other
people
before
myself
as
taffy
does
and
your
son
and
never
to
tell
lies
or
be
afraid
and
keep
away
from
drink
and
i
should
be
all
right
but
i
sometimes
been
all
wrong
all
the
same
and
it
was
papa
fault
but
poor
mamma
and
mine
and
i
known
it
and
been
miserable
at
the
time
and
after
and
i
sure
to
be
forgiven
perfectly
certain
and
so
will
everybody
else
even
the
wickedest
that
ever
lived
why
just
give
them
sense
enough
in
the
next
world
to
understand
all
their
wickedness
in
this
and
punish
them
enough
for
anything
i
think
that
simple
enough
it
besides
there
may
be
next
world
that
on
the
cards
too
you
know
and
that
will
be
simpler
still
not
all
the
clergymen
in
all
the
world
not
even
the
pope
of
rome
will
ever
make
me
doubt
papa
or
believe
in
any
punishment
after
what
all
got
to
go
through
here
serait
trop
bête
so
that
if
you
do
want
me
to
very
much
and
he
wo
think
it
unkind
i
rather
not
talk
to
thomas
bagot
about
it
i
rather
talk
to
taffy
if
i
must
he
very
clever
taffy
though
he
often
say
such
clever
things
as
your
son
does
or
paint
nearly
so
well
and
i
sure
he
think
papa
was
right
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
good
taffy
in
his
opinion
on
this
solemn
subject
was
found
to
be
at
one
with
the
late
reverend
patrick
michael
and
so
was
the
laird
and
so
to
his
mother
shocked
and
pained
surprise
was
little
billee
and
so
were
sir
oliver
calthorpe
and
sir
jacob
wilcox
and
doctor
thorne
and
antony
and
lorrimer
and
the
greek
and
so
in
when
grief
had
well
pierced
and
torn
and
riddled
her
through
and
through
and
time
and
age
had
healed
the
wounds
and
nothing
remained
but
the
consciousness
of
great
inward
scars
of
recollection
to
remind
her
how
deep
and
jagged
and
wide
the
wounds
had
once
been
did
bagot
herself
late
on
one
memorable
saturday
afternoon
just
as
it
was
getting
dusk
in
charlotte
street
trilby
in
her
pretty
blue
lay
on
the
sofa
by
the
fire
her
head
well
propped
her
knees
drawn
up
looking
very
placid
and
content
she
had
spent
the
early
part
of
the
day
dictating
her
will
to
the
conscientious
taffy
it
was
a
simple
document
although
she
was
not
without
many
valuable
trinkets
to
leave
quite
a
fortune
souvenirs
from
many
men
and
women
she
had
charmed
by
her
singing
from
royalties
downward
she
had
been
looking
them
over
with
the
faithful
marta
to
whom
she
had
always
thought
they
belonged
it
was
explained
to
her
that
they
were
gifts
of
svengali
since
she
did
not
remember
when
and
where
and
by
whom
they
were
presented
to
her
except
a
few
that
svengali
had
given
her
himself
with
many
passionate
expressions
of
his
love
which
seems
to
have
been
deep
and
constant
and
sincere
none
the
less
so
perhaps
that
she
could
never
return
it
she
had
left
the
bulk
of
these
to
the
faithful
marta
but
to
each
of
the
trois
angliches
she
had
bequeathed
a
beautiful
ring
which
was
to
be
worn
by
their
brides
if
they
ever
married
and
the
brides
did
object
to
bagot
she
left
a
pearl
necklace
to
miss
bagot
her
gold
coronet
of
stars
and
pretty
and
most
costly
gifts
to
each
of
the
three
doctors
who
had
attended
her
and
been
so
assiduous
in
their
care
and
who
as
she
was
told
would
make
no
charge
for
attending
on
madame
svengali
and
studs
and
to
antony
lorrimer
the
greek
dodor
and
zouzou
and
to
carnegie
a
little
vinaigrette
which
had
once
belonged
to
lord
witlow
and
pretty
souvenirs
to
the
vinards
angèle
boisse
durien
and
others
and
she
left
a
magnificent
gold
watch
and
chain
to
gecko
with
a
most
affectionate
letter
and
a
hundred
pounds
which
was
all
she
had
in
money
of
her
own
she
had
taken
great
interest
in
discussing
with
taffy
the
particular
kind
of
trinket
which
would
best
suit
the
idiosyncrasy
of
each
particular
legatee
and
derived
great
comfort
from
the
and
sympathetic
conscientiousness
with
which
the
good
taffy
entered
upon
all
these
minutiæ
he
was
so
solemn
and
serious
about
it
and
took
such
pains
she
little
guessed
how
his
dumb
but
deeply
feeling
heart
was
harrowed
this
document
had
been
duly
signed
and
witnessed
and
intrusted
to
his
care
and
trilby
lay
tranquil
and
happy
and
with
a
sense
that
nothing
remained
for
her
but
to
enjoy
the
fleeting
hour
and
make
the
most
of
each
precious
moment
as
it
went
by
she
was
quite
without
pain
of
either
mind
or
body
and
surrounded
by
the
people
she
adored
taffy
the
laird
and
little
billee
and
bagot
and
marta
who
sat
knitting
in
a
corner
with
her
black
mittens
on
and
her
brass
spectacles
she
listened
to
the
chat
and
joined
in
it
laughing
as
usual
love
in
her
eyes
sat
playing
as
she
looked
from
one
to
another
for
she
loved
them
all
beyond
expression
love
on
her
lips
was
straying
and
warbling
in
her
breath
whenever
she
spoke
and
her
weakened
voice
was
still
larger
fuller
softer
than
any
other
voice
in
the
room
in
the
world
of
another
kind
from
another
sphere
a
cart
drove
up
there
was
a
ring
at
the
door
and
presently
a
wooden
was
brought
into
the
room
at
trilby
request
it
was
opened
and
found
to
contain
a
large
photograph
framed
and
glazed
of
svengali
in
the
military
uniform
of
his
own
hungarian
band
and
looking
straight
out
of
the
picture
straight
at
you
he
was
standing
by
his
desk
with
his
left
hand
turning
over
a
leaf
of
music
and
waving
his
bâton
with
his
right
it
was
a
splendid
photograph
by
a
viennese
photographer
and
a
most
speaking
likeness
and
svengali
looked
truly
fine
all
made
up
of
importance
and
authority
and
his
big
black
eyes
were
full
of
stern
command
illustration
for
gecko
marta
trembled
as
she
looked
it
was
handed
to
trilby
who
exclaimed
in
surprise
she
had
never
seen
it
she
had
no
photograph
of
him
and
had
never
possessed
one
no
message
of
any
kind
no
letter
of
explanation
accompanied
this
unexpected
present
which
from
the
postmarks
on
the
case
seemed
to
have
travelled
all
over
europe
to
london
out
of
some
remote
province
in
eastern
russia
out
of
the
mysterious
east
the
poisonous
east
birthplace
and
home
of
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
trilby
laid
it
against
her
legs
as
on
a
lectern
and
lay
gazing
at
it
with
close
attention
for
a
long
time
making
a
casual
remark
now
and
then
as
he
was
very
handsome
i
think
or
that
uniform
becomes
him
very
well
why
has
he
got
it
on
i
wonder
illustration
out
of
the
mysterious
east
the
others
went
on
talking
and
bagot
made
coffee
presently
bagot
took
a
cup
of
coffee
to
trilby
and
found
her
still
staring
intently
at
the
portrait
but
with
her
eyes
dilated
and
quite
a
strange
light
in
them
trilby
trilby
your
coffee
what
is
the
matter
trilby
trilby
was
smiling
with
fixed
eyes
and
made
no
answer
the
others
got
up
and
gathered
round
her
in
some
alarm
marta
seemed
and
wished
to
snatch
the
photograph
away
but
was
prevented
from
doing
so
one
did
know
what
the
consequences
might
be
taffy
rang
the
bell
and
sent
a
servant
for
thorne
who
lived
close
by
in
fitzroy
square
presently
trilby
began
to
speak
quite
softly
in
french
encore
une
fois
bon
je
veux
bien
avec
la
voix
blanche
alors
pas
et
puis
foncer
au
milieu
et
pas
trop
vite
en
commençant
battez
bien
la
mesure
svengali
que
je
puisse
bien
voir
car
il
fait
déjà
nuit
ça
allons
gecko
le
ton
then
she
smiled
and
seemed
to
beat
time
softly
by
moving
her
head
a
little
from
side
to
side
her
eyes
intent
on
svengali
in
the
portrait
and
suddenly
she
began
to
sing
chopin
impromptu
in
a
flat
she
hardly
seemed
to
breathe
as
the
notes
came
pouring
out
without
words
mere
vocalizing
it
was
as
if
breath
were
unnecessary
for
so
little
voice
as
she
was
using
though
there
was
enough
of
it
to
fill
the
room
to
fill
the
house
to
drown
her
small
audience
in
holy
heavenly
sweetness
she
was
a
consummate
mistress
of
her
art
how
that
could
be
seen
and
also
how
splendid
had
been
her
training
it
all
seemed
as
easy
to
her
as
opening
and
shutting
her
eyes
and
yet
how
utterly
impossible
to
anybody
else
between
wonder
enchantment
and
alarm
they
were
frozen
to
statues
all
except
marta
who
ran
out
of
the
room
crying
gott
im
himmel
wieder
zurück
wieder
zurück
she
sang
it
just
as
she
had
sung
it
at
the
salle
des
bashibazoucks
only
it
sounded
still
more
ineffably
seductive
as
she
was
using
less
voice
using
the
essence
of
her
voice
in
fact
the
pure
spirit
the
very
cream
of
it
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
these
four
watchers
by
that
enchanted
couch
were
listening
to
not
only
the
most
divinely
beautiful
but
also
the
most
astounding
feat
of
musical
utterance
ever
heard
out
of
a
human
throat
the
usual
effect
was
produced
tears
were
streaming
down
the
cheeks
of
bagot
and
little
billee
tears
were
in
the
laird
eyes
a
tear
on
one
of
taffy
whiskers
tears
of
sheer
delight
when
she
came
back
to
the
quick
movement
again
after
the
adagio
her
voice
grew
louder
and
shriller
and
sweet
with
a
sweetness
not
of
this
earth
and
went
on
increasing
in
volume
as
she
quickened
the
time
nearing
the
end
and
then
came
the
dying
away
into
all
but
nothing
a
mere
melodic
breath
and
then
the
little
soft
chromatic
ascending
rocket
up
to
e
in
alt
the
last
parting
caress
which
svengali
had
introduced
as
a
finale
for
it
does
not
exist
in
the
piano
score
when
it
was
over
she
said
ça
y
cette
fois
svengali
ah
tant
mieux
à
la
fin
pas
malheureux
et
maintenant
mon
ami
suis
fatiguée
bon
her
head
fell
back
on
the
pillow
and
she
lay
fast
asleep
bagot
took
the
portrait
away
gently
little
billee
knelt
down
and
held
trilby
hand
in
his
and
felt
for
her
pulse
and
could
not
find
it
he
said
trilby
trilby
and
put
his
ear
to
her
mouth
to
hear
her
breathe
her
breath
was
inaudible
but
soon
she
folded
her
hands
across
her
breast
and
uttered
a
little
short
sigh
and
in
a
weak
voice
said
svengali
svengali
they
remained
in
silence
round
her
for
several
minutes
the
doctor
came
he
put
his
hand
to
her
heart
his
ear
to
her
lips
he
turned
up
one
of
her
eyelids
and
looked
at
her
eye
and
then
his
voice
quivering
with
strong
emotion
he
stood
up
and
said
madame
trials
and
sufferings
are
all
over
oh
good
god
is
she
cried
bagot
yes
bagot
she
has
been
dead
several
minutes
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
vingt
ans
après
taffy
wynne
is
sitting
to
breakfast
opposite
his
wife
at
a
little
table
in
the
of
that
huge
caravanserai
on
the
boulevard
des
capucines
paris
where
he
had
sat
more
than
twenty
years
ago
with
the
laird
and
little
billee
where
in
fact
he
had
pulled
svengali
nose
little
is
changed
in
the
aspect
of
the
place
the
same
cosmopolite
company
with
more
of
the
american
element
perhaps
the
same
arrivals
and
departures
in
railway
omnibuses
cabs
hired
carriages
and
airing
his
calves
on
the
marble
steps
stood
just
such
another
colossal
and
beautiful
old
man
in
black
cloth
coat
and
and
silk
stockings
as
of
yore
with
probably
the
very
same
pinchbeck
chain
where
do
they
breed
these
magnificent
old
frenchmen
in
germany
perhaps
where
all
the
good
big
waiters
come
from
and
also
the
same
fine
weather
it
is
always
fine
weather
in
the
of
the
grand
hôtel
as
the
laird
would
say
they
manage
these
things
better
there
taffy
wears
a
short
beard
which
is
turning
gray
his
kind
blue
eye
is
no
longer
choleric
but
mild
and
friendly
as
frank
as
ever
and
full
of
humorous
patience
he
has
grown
stouter
he
is
very
big
indeed
in
all
three
dimensions
but
the
symmetry
and
the
gainliness
of
the
athlete
belong
to
him
still
in
movement
and
repose
and
his
clothes
fit
him
beautifully
though
they
are
not

the
most
cynical
disbeliever
in
the
grand
old
name
of
gentleman
and
its
virtues
as
a
noun
of
definition
would
almost
be
justified
in
quite
dogmatically
asserting
at
sight
and
without
even
being
introduced
that
at
all
events
taffy
is
a
gentleman
inside
and
out
up
and
down
from
the
crown
of
his
head
which
is
getting
rather
bald
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
by
no
means
a
small
one
or
a
lightly
shod
pede
indeed
this
is
always
the
first
thing
people
say
of
taffy
and
the
last
it
means
perhaps
that
he
may
be
a
trifle
dull

so
was

so
was

fortunately
for
both

very
well

very

deeply
interested

that
is
going
on
about

around
her
and
with
always
lots
to
say
about
it
but
not
too
much
she
distinctly
belongs
to
the
rare
and
and
most
precious
race
of
charmers
she
had
fallen
in

with
the
stalwart
taffy
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
in
the
place

where
he
and
she
and
her

found

to

one
terrible
night
never
to
be

taffy
lay
fast
asleep
in
bed
at
his
rooms
in
jermyn
street
for
he
was
very
tired
grief
tires
more
than
anything
and
brings
a
deeper

that
day
he
had
followed

her

a
splendid

most

gathering
as
was
duly
chronicled
in

the
newspapers
here
and
abroad
a
fitting
ceremony
to
close
the
brief
but
splendid
career
of
the
greatest
of
our
time
he
was
awakened
by
a
tremendous
ringing
at
the
bell
as
if
the
house
were
on
fire
and
then
there
was
a
hurried
scrambling
up
in
the
dark
a
tumbling
over
stairs
and
kicking
against
banisters
and
little
billee
had
burst
into
his
room
calling
out
oh

she
recovered
her
senses
the
very
minute
she
saw
his
photograph
she
was
so
of

she

she
gone
straight
to
him
after
all
in

to

miserable
business
of

has

in

of
poor

long

his
slow
and

partial

illustration
i
pete

for
all
but
blameless
as
his
short
life
had
been
and
so
full
of
splendid
promise
and
performance
nothing
ever
became
him
better
than
the
way
he
left
it
it
was
as
if
he
were
starting
on
some
distant
holy
quest
like
some
gallant
knight
of
old
a
bagot
to
the
rescue
it
shook
the
infallibility
of
a
certain
vicar
down
to
its
very
foundations
and
made
him
think
more
deeply
about
things
than
he
had
ever
thought
yet
it
gave
him
pause
and
so
wrung
his
heart
that
when
at
the
last
he
stooped
to
kiss
his
poor
young
dead
friend
pure
white
forehead
he
dropped
a
bigger
tear
on
it
than
little
billee
once
so
given
to
the
dropping
of
big
tears
had
ever
dropped
in
his
life
but
it
is
all
too
sad
to
write
about
it
was
by
little
billee
bedside
in
devonshire
that
taffy
had
grown
to
love
blanche
bagot
and
not
very
many
weeks
after
it
was
all
over
that
taffy
had
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
and
in
a
year
they
were
married
and
a
very
happy
marriage
it
turned
out
the
one
thing
that
poor
bagot
still
looks
upon
as
a
compensation
for
all
the
griefs
and
troubles
of
her
life
during
the
first
year
or
two
blanche
had
perhaps
been
the
most
ardently
loving
of
this
pair
that
beautiful
look
of
love
surprised
which
makes
all
women
eyes
look
the
same
came
into
hers
whenever
she
looked
at
taffy
and
filled
his
heart
with
tender
compunction
and
a
queer
sense
of
his
own
unworthiness
then
a
boy
was
born
to
them
and
that
look
fell
on
the
boy
and
the
good
taffy
caught
it
as
it
passed
him
by
and
he
felt
a
helpless
absurd
jealousy
that
was
none
the
less
painful
for
being
so
ridiculous
and
then
that
look
fell
on
another
boy
and
yet
another
so
that
it
was
through
these
boys
that
she
looked
at
their
father
then
eyes
caught
the
look
and
kept
it
for
their
own
use
and
he
grew
never
to
look
at
his
wife
without
it
and
as
no
daughter
came
she
retained
for
life
the
monopoly
of
that
most
sweet
and
expressive
regard
they
are
not
very
rich
he
is
a
far
better
sportsman
than
he
will
ever
be
a
painter
and
if
he
does
sell
his
pictures
it
is
not
because
they
are
too
good
for
the
public
taste
indeed
he
has
no
illusions
on
that
score
himself
even
if
his
wife
has
he
is
quite
the
least
conceited
i
ever
met
and
i
have
met
many
far
worse
duffers
than
taffy
would
only
that
i
might
kill
off
his
cousin
sir
oscar
and
sir
five
sons
the
wynnes
are
good
at
sons
and
his
seventeen
grandsons
and
the
fourteen
cousins
and
their
numerous
male
progeny
that
stand
between
taffy
and
the
baronetcy
and
whatever
property
goes
with
it
so
that
he
might
be
sir
taffy
and
dear
blanche
bagot
that
was
might
be
called
my
lady
this
shakespearian
holocaust
would
scarcely
cost
me
a
pang
it
is
a
great
temptation
when
you
have
duly
slain
your
first
hero
to
enrich
hero
number
two
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
and
provide
him
with
a
title
and
a
castle
and
park
as
well
as
a
handsome
wife
and
a
nice
family
but
truth
is
inexorable
and
besides
they
are
just
as
happy
as
they
are
they
are
well
off
enough
anyhow
to
spend
a
week
in
paris
at
last
and
even
to
stop
at
the
grand
hôtel
now
that
two
of
their
sons
are
at
harrow
where
their
father
was
before
them
and
the
third
is
safe
at
a
preparatory
school
at
elstree
herts
it
is
their
first
outing
since
the
honeymoon
and
the
laird
should
have
come
with
them
but
the
good
laird
of
cockpen
who
is
now
a
famous
royal
academician
is
preparing
for
a
honeymoon
of
his
own
he
has
gone
to
scotland
to
be
married
himself
to
wed
a
fair
and
clever
of
just
a
suitable
age
for
he
has
known
her
ever
since
she
was
a
bright
little
lassie
in
short
frocks
and
he
a
promising
the
pride
of
his
native
dundee
a
marriage
of
reason
and
affection
and
mutual
esteem
and
therefore
sure
to
turn
out
a
happy
one
and
in
another
fortnight
or
so
the
pair
of
them
will
very
possibly
be
sitting
to
breakfast
opposite
each
other
at
that
very
corner
table
in
the
of
the
grand
hôtel
and
she
will
laugh
at
everything
he
says
and
they
will
live
happily

all
over
the

latin
and
revisited

spots

allowed
to
enter
the

studio
through

kindness
of

concierge

by

that

the

were
so
good
that

forgot
to
notice
the
food
and
that
was
a
pity
and
the

are
all
right
and
so
are
the

as
for

there
are
any

taken

knows

extremely
plain
old
woman
with

cracked
voice
of

reputation
and
the
irreproachable
mother
of

has
drawn

line
at

life
she
is
quite
the
lady
but
on
the
stage
well
go
and
see
her
and
you
will
understand
how
she
comes
to
be
the
idol
of
the
parisian
public
for
she
is
the
true
and
liberal
dispenser
to
them
of
that
modern
esprit
gaulois
which
would
make
the
good
rabelais
turn
uneasily
in
his
grave
and
blush
there
like
a
benedictine
sister
and
truly
she
deserves
the
reverential
love
and
gratitude
of
her
chers
parisiens
she
amused
them
all
through
the
empire
during
the
she
was
their
only
stay
and
comfort
and
has
been
their
chief
delight
ever
since
and
is
now
when
they
come
back
from
may
madame
cantharidi
be
still
at
her
post
les
mouches
to
welcome
the
returning
heroes
and
exult
and
crow
with
them
in
her
funny
cracked
old
voice
or
haply
even
console
them
once
more
as
the
case
may
be
illustration
petits
bonheurs
de
contrebande
victors
or
vanquished
they
will
laugh
the
same
taffy
is
a
poor
french
scholar
one
must
know
french
very
well
indeed
and
many
other
things
besides
to
seize
the
subtle
points
of
madame
cantharidi
play
and
but
madame
cantharidi
has
so
droll
a
face
and
voice
and
such
very
droll
odd
movements
that
taffy
goes
into
fits
of
laughter
as
soon
as
the
quaint
little
old
lady
comes
on
the
stage
so
heartily
does
she
laugh
that
a
good
parisian
bourgeois
turns
round
and
remarks
to
his
wife

anglaise
qui
pas

il
pas
trop
content
par
exemple
the
fact
is
that
the
good
taffy
who
knows
french
very
well
indeed
is
quite
scandalized
and
very
angry
with
dodor
for
sending
them
there
and
as
soon
as
the
first
act
is
finished
he
means
without
any
fuss
to
take
his
wife
away
as
he
sits
patiently
too
indignant
to
laugh
at
what
is
really
funny
in
the
piece
much
of
it
is
vulgar
being
funny
he
finds
himself
watching
a
little
man
in
the
orchestra
a
fiddler
the
shape
of
whose
back
seems
somehow
familiar
as
he
plays
an
accompaniment
to
a
very
broadly
comic
song
of
madame
cantharidi
he
plays
beautifully
like
a
master
and
the
loud
applause
is
as
much
for
him
as
for
the
vocalist
presently
this
fiddler
turns
his
head
so
that
his
profile
can
be
seen
and
taffy
recognizes
him
after
five
minutes
thought
taffy
takes
a
leaf
out
of
his
and
writes
in
perfectly
grammatical
french
dear
gecko
you
have
not
forgotten
taffy
wynne
i
hope
and
litrebili
and

sister
who
is
now
taffy

we
leave
paris
and
would
like
very
much
to
see
you

you
after
the
play
come
and
sup
with
us
at
the
café
anglais
if
so
look
up
and
make
with

and
enchant

gives
this
folded
to

attendant
for
le
premier
violon
celui
qui
a
des
cheveux
blancs
presently
he
sees
gecko
receive
the
note
and
read
it
and
ponder
for
a
while
then
gecko
looks
round
the
theatre
and
taffy
waves
his
handkerchief
and
catches
the
eye
of
the
premier
violon
who
makes
with
the
head
and
then
the
first
act
over
and
wynne
leave
the
theatre
explaining
why
and
very
ready
to
go
as
she
was
beginning
to
feel
strangely
uncomfortable
without
quite
realizing
as
yet
what
was
amiss
with
the
lively
madame
cantharidi
they
went
to
the
café
anglais
and
bespoke
a
nice
little
room
on
the
entresol
overlooking
the
boulevard
and
ordered
a
nice
little
supper
salmi
of
something
very
good
mayonnaise
of
lobster
and
one
or
two
other
dishes
better
still
and
chambertin
of
the
best
taffy
was
particular
about
these
things
on
a
holiday
and
regardless
of
expense
porthos
was
very
hospitable
and
liked
good
food
and
plenty
of
it
and
athos
dearly
loved
good
wine
and
then
they
went
and
sat
at
a
little
round
table
outside
the
café
de
la
paix
on
the
boulevard
near
the
grand
opéra
where
it
is
always
very
gay
and
studied
paris
life
and
nursed
their
appetites
till
at
eleven
gecko
made
his
appearance
very
meek
and
humble
he
looked
old
ten
years
older
than
he
really
was
much
bowed
down
and
as
if
he
had
roughed
it
all
his
life
and
had
found
living
a
desperate
long
hard
grind
he
kissed
taffy
hand
and
seemed
half
inclined
to
kiss
too
and
was
almost
tearful
in
his
pleasure
at
meeting
them
again
and
his
gratitude
at
being
asked
to
sup
with
them
he
had
soft
clinging
caressing
manners
like
a
nice
dog
that
made
you
his
friend
at
once
he
was
obviously
genuine
and
sincere
and
quite
pathetically
simple
as
he
always
had
been
at
first
he
could
scarcely
eat
for
nervous
excitement
but
taffy
fine
example
and
taffy
genial
cordiality
and
a
couple
of
glasses
of
chambertin
soon
put
him
at
his
ease
and
woke
up
his
dormant
appetite
which
was
a
very
large
one
poor
fellow
he
was
told
all
about
little
billee
death
and
deeply
moved
to
hear
the
cause
which
had
brought
it
about
and
then
they
talked
of
trilby
illustration
enter
gecko
he
pulled
her
watch
out
of
his
and
reverently
kissed
it
exclaiming
ah
un
ange
un
ange
du
paradis
when
i
tell
you
i
lived
with
them
for
five
years
oh
her
kindness
dio
dio
maria
it
was
this
and
that
and
gecko
your
toothache
how
it
worries
me
and
how
tired
and
pale
you
look
you
distress
me
so
looking
like
that
shall
i
mix
you
a
maitrank
and
you
love
artichokes
à
la
barigoule
they
remind
you
of
paris
i
have
heard
you
say
so
well
i
have
found
out
where
to
get
artichokes
and
i
know
how
to
do
them
à
la
barigoule
and
you
shall
have
them
for
dinner
and
and
all
the
week
after
and
we
did
ach
dear
kind
one
what
did
i
really
care
for
artichokes
à
la
barigoule
and
it
was
always
like
that
always
and
to
svengali
and
old
marta
just
the
same
and
she
was
never
well
never
toujours
souffrante
and
it
was
she
who
supported
us
all
in
luxury
and
splendor
sometimes
and
an
artist
said
taffy
ah
yes
but
all
that
was
svengali
you
know
svengali
was
the
greatest
artist
i
ever
met
monsieur
svengali
was
a
demon
a
magician
i
used
to
think
him
a
god
he
found
me
playing
in
the
streets
for
copper
coins
and
took
me
by
the
hand
and
was
my
only
friend
and
taught
me
all
i
ever
knew
and
yet
he
could
not
play
my
instrument
and
now
he
is
dead
i
have
forgotten
how
to
play
it
myself
that
english
jail
it
demoralized
me
ruined
me
forever
ach
quel
enfer
nom
de
dieu
pardon
madame
i
am
just
good
enough
to
play
the
at
the
mouches
when
the
old
cantharidi
sings
mon
mari
qui
prends
garde
ne
plus
it
does
not
want
much
of
an
hein
a
song
so
noble
and
so
beautiful
as
that
and
that
song
monsieur
all
paris
is
singing
it
now
and
that
is
the
paris
that
went
mad
when
trilby
sang
the
of
schumann
at
the
salle
des
bashibazoucks
you
heard
her
well
and
here
poor
gecko
tried
to
laugh
a
little
sardonic
laugh
in
falsetto
like
svengali
full
of
scorn
and
bitterness
and
very
nearly
succeeded
but
what
made
you
strike
him
with
with
that
knife
you
know
ah
monsieur
it
had
been
coming
on
for
a
long
time
he
used
to
work
trilby
too
hard
it
was
killing
her
it
killed
her
at
last
and
then
at
the
end
he
was
unkind
to
her
and
scolded
her
and
called
her
names
horrid
names
and
then
one
day
in
london
he
struck
her
he
struck
her
on
the
fingers
with
his
bâton
and
she
fell
down
on
her
knees
and
cried
monsieur
i
would
have
defended
trilby
against
a
locomotive
going
grande
vitesse
against
my
own
father
against
the
emperor
of
austria
against
the
pope
and
i
am
a
good
catholic
monsieur
i
would
have
gone
to
the
scaffold
for
her
and
to
the
devil
after
and
he
piously
crossed
himself
but
svengali
was
very
fond
of
her
oh
yes
monsieur
quant
à
ça
passionately
but
she
did
not
love
him
as
he
wished
to
be
loved
she
loved
litrebili
monsieur
litrebili
the
brother
of
madame
and
i
suppose
that
svengali
grew
angry
and
jealous
at
last
he
changed
as
soon
as
he
came
to
paris
perhaps
paris
reminded
him
of
litrebili
and
reminded
trilby
too
but
how
on
earth
did
svengali
ever
manage
to
teach
her
how
to
sing
like
that
she
had
no
ear
for
music
whatever
when
knew
her
gecko
was
silent
for
a
while
and
taffy
filled
his
glass
and
gave
him
a
cigar
and
lit
one
himself
monsieur
no
that
is
true
she
had
not
much
ear
but
she
had
such
a
voice
as
had
never
been
heard
svengali
knew
that
he
had
found
it
out
long
ago
litolff
had
found
it
out
too
one
day
svengali
heard
litolff
tell
meyerbeer
that
the
most
beautiful
female
voice
in
europe
belonged
to
an
english
grisette
who
sat
as
a
model
to
sculptors
in
the
quartier
latin
but
that
unfortunately
she
was
quite
and
could
sing
one
single
note
in
tune
imagine
how
svengali
chuckled
i
see
it
from
here
well
we
both
taught
her
together
for
three
years
morning
noon
and
night
six
eight
hours
a
day
it
used
to
split
me
the
heart
to
see
her
worked
like
that
we
took
her
voice
note
by
note
there
was
no
end
to
her
notes
each
more
beautiful
than
the
other
velvet
and
gold
beautiful
flowers
pearls
diamonds
rubies
drops
of
dew
and
honey
peaches
oranges
and
lemons
en
en
voilà
all
the
perfumes
and
spices
of
the
garden
of
eden
svengali
with
his
little
flexible
flageolet
i
with
my
violin
that
is
how
we
taught
her
to
make
the
sounds
and
then
how
to
use
them
she
was
a
phénomène
monsieur
she
could
keep
on
one
note
and
make
it
go
through
all
the
colors
in
the
rainbow
according
to
the
way
svengali
looked
at
her
it
would
make
you
laugh
it
would
make
you
cry
but
cry
or
laugh
it
was
the
sweetest
the
most
touching
the
most
beautiful
note
you
ever
heard
except
all
her
others
and
each
had
as
many
overtones
as
the
bells
in
the
carillon
de
notre
dame
she
could
run
up
and
down
the
scales
chromatic
scales
quicker
and
better
and
smoother
than
svengali
on
the
piano
and
more
in
tune
than
any
piano
and
her
shake
ach
twin
stars
monsieur
she
was
the
greatest
contralto
the
greatest
soprano
the
world
has
ever
known
the
like
of
her
has
never
been
the
like
of
her
will
never
be
again
and
yet
she
only
sang
in
public
for
two
years
illustration
took
her
voice
note
by
note
ach
those
breaks
and
runs
and
sudden
leaps
from
darkness
into
light
and
back
again
from
earth
to
heaven
those
slurs
and
swoops
and
slides
à
la
paganini
from
one
note
to
another
like
a
swallow
flying
or
a
gull
do
you
remember
them
how
they
drove
you
mad
let
any
other
singer
in
the
world
try
to
imitate
them
they
would
make
you
sick
that
was
svengali
he
was
a
magician
and
how
she
looked
singing
do
you
remember
her
hands
behind
her
her
dear
sweet
slender
foot
on
a
little
stool
her
thick
hair
lying
down
all
along
her
back
and
that
good
smile
like
the
madonna
so
soft
and
bright
and
kind
bel
ucel
di
dio
it
was
to
make
you
weep
for
love
merely
to
see
her
à
vous
faire
pleurer
rien
que
de
la
that
was
trilby
nightingale
and
in
one
enfin
she
could
do
anything
utter
any
sound
she
liked
when
once
svengali
had
shown
her
how
and
he
was
the
greatest
master
that
ever
lived
and
when
once
she
knew
a
thing
she
knew
it
voilà
how
strange
said
taffy
that
she
should
have
suddenly
gone
out
of
her
senses
that
night
at
drury
lane
and
so
completely
forgotten
it
all
i
suppose
she
saw
svengali
die
in
the
box
opposite
and
that
drove
her
mad
and
then
taffy
told
the
little
fiddler
about
trilby
like
a
swan
and
svengali
photograph
but
gecko
had
heard
it
all
from
marta
who
was
now
dead
gecko
sat
and
smoked
and
pondered
for
a
while
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
then
he
pulled
himself
together
with
an
effort
so
to
speak
and
said
monsieur
she
never
went
mad
not
for
one
moment
what
do
you
mean
to
say
she
us
all
non
monsieur
she
could
never
deceive
anybody
and
never
would
had
forgotten
voilà
tout
but
hang
it
all
my
friend
one
does
such
a
monsieur
listen
she
is
dead
and
svengali
is
dead
and
marta
also
and
i
have
a
good
little
malady
that
will
kill
me
soon
sei
and
without
much
pain
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
were
two
there
was
the
trilby
you
knew
who
could
not
sing
one
single
note
in
tune
she
was
an
angel
of
paradise
she
is
now
but
she
had
no
more
idea
of
singing
than
i
have
of
winning
a
at
the
croix
de
berny
she
could
no
more
sing
than
a
fiddle
can
play
itself
she
could
never
tell
one
tune
from
another
one
note
from
the
next
do
you
remember
how
she
tried
to
sing
that
day
when
she
first
came
to
the
studio
in
the
place
anatole
des
arts
it
was
droll
à
se
boucher
les
well
that
was
trilby
your
trilby
that
was
my
trilby
too
and
i
loved
her
as
one
loves
an
only
love
an
only
sister
an
only
child
a
gentle
martyr
on
earth
a
blessed
saint
in
heaven
and
that
trilby
was
enough
for
and
that
was
the
trilby
that
loved
your
brother
madame
oh
but
with
all
the
love
that
was
in
her
he
did
not
know
what
he
had
lost
your
brother
her
love
it
was
immense
like
her
voice
and
just
as
full
of
celestial
sweetness
and
sympathy
she
told
me
everything
pauvre
litrebili
ce
a
but
all
at
once
presto
augenblick
with
one
wave
of
his
hand
over
her
with
one
look
of
his
eye
with
a
word
svengali
could
turn
her
into
the
other
trilby
trilby
and
make
her
do
whatever
he
liked
you
might
have
run
a
needle
into
her
and
she
would
not
have
felt
it
he
had
but
to
say
and
she
suddenly
became
an
unconscious
trilby
of
marble
who
could
produce
wonderful
sounds
just
the
sounds
he
wanted
and
nothing
else
and
think
his
thoughts
and
wish
his
wishes
and
love
him
at
his
bidding
with
a
strange
unreal
factitious
love
just
his
own
love
for
himself
turned
inside
out
and
reflected
back
on
him
as
from
a
mirror
écho
un
simulacre
quoi
pas
autre
chose
it
was
not
worth
having
i
was
not
even
jealous
well
that
was
the
trilby
he
taught
how
to
sing
and
and
i
helped
him
god
of
heaven
forgive
me
that
trilby
was
just
a
an
organ
to
play
upon
an
instrument
of
music
a
stradivarius
a
flexible
flageolet
of
flesh
and
blood
a
voice
and
nothing
more
just
the
unconscious
voice
that
svengali
sang
with
for
it
takes
two
to
sing
like
la
svengali
monsieur
the
one
who
has
got
the
voice
and
the
one
who
knows
what
to
do
with
it
so
that
when
you
heard
her
sing
the
the
you
heard
svengali
singing
with
her
voice
just
as
you
hear
joachim
play
a
chaconne
of
bach
with
his
fiddle
herr
joachim
fiddle
what
does
it
know
of
sebastian
bach
and
as
for
chaconnes
moque
pas
mal
ce
fameux
violon
and
trilby
what
did
she
know
of
schumann
chopin
nothing
at
all
she
mocked
herself
not
badly
of
nussbaums
and
impromptus
they
would
make
her
yawn
to
demantibulate
her
jaws
when
svengali
trilby
was
being
taught
to
sing
when
svengali
trilby
was
singing
or
seemed
to
as
if
she
were
singing
trilby
had
ceased
to
exist
trilby
was
fast
asleep
in
fact
trilby
was
illustration
the
nightingale
first
song
ah
monsieur
that
trilby
of
svengali
i
have
heard
her
sing
to
kings
and
queens
in
royal
palaces
as
no
woman
has
ever
sung
before
or
since
i
have
seen
emperors
and
kiss
her
hand
monsieur
and
their
wives
and
daughters
kiss
her
lips
and
weep
i
have
seen
the
horses
taken
out
of
her
sledge
and
the
pick
of
the
nobility
drag
her
home
to
the
hotel
with
torchlights
and
choruses
and
shoutings
of
glory
and
long
life
to
her
and
serenades
all
night
under
her
window
never
knew
she
heard
nothing
felt
nothing
saw
nothing
and
she
bowed
to
them
right
and
left
like
a
queen
i
have
played
the
fiddle
for
her
while
she
sang
in
the
streets
at
fairs
and
festas
and
kermessen
and
seen
the
people
go
mad
to
hear
her
and
once
at
prague
svengali
fell
down
in
a
fit
from
sheer
excitement
and
then
suddenly
trilby
woke
up
and
wondered
what
it
was
all
about
and
we
took
him
home
and
put
him
to
bed
and
left
him
with
marta
and
trilby
and
i
went
together
arm
in
arm
all
over
the
town
to
fetch
a
doctor
and
buy
things
for
supper
and
that
was
the
happiest
hour
in
all
my
life
ach
what
an
existence
what
travels
what
triumphs
what
adventures
things
to
fill
a
book
a
dozen
books
those
five
happy
years
with
those
two
trilbys
what
recollections
i
think
of
nothing
else
night
or
day
even
as
i
play
the
fiddle
for
old
cantharidi
ach
to
think
how
often
i
have
played
the
fiddle
for
la
svengali
to
have
done
that
is
to
have
lived
and
then
to
come
home
to
trilby
trilby
the
trilby
got

his
eyes
were
red
and
his
voice
was
high
and
shrill
and
tremulous
and
full
of
tears
these
remembrances
were
too
much
for
him
and
perhaps
also
the
chambertin
he
put
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
wept
muttering
to
himself
in
his
own
language

that
might
have
been

if
he
were
praying

and
his

got
up
and
leaned
on

and
looked
out
on
the
deserted
boulevards
where
an
army
of
scavengers
noiseless
and
taciturn
was
cleansing
the
asphalt
roadway
the
night
above
was
dark
but
hinted
of
morn
and
a
fresh
breeze
had
sprung
up
making
the
leaves
dance
and
rustle
on
the
along
the
boulevard
a
nice
little
breeze
just
the
sort
of
little
breeze
to
do
paris
good
a
cab
came
by
at
a
foot
pace
the
driver
humming
a
tune
taffy
hailed
him
he
said
and
drew
up
taffy
rang
the
bell
and
asked
for
the
bill
and
paid
it
gecko
had
apparently
fallen
asleep
taffy
gently
woke
him
up
and
told
him
how
late
it
was
the
poor
little
man
seemed
dazed
and
rather
tipsy
and
looked
older
than
ever
sixty
seventy
any
age
you
like
taffy
helped
him
on
with
his
and
taking
him
by
the
arm
led
him
giving
him
his
card
and
telling
him
how
glad
he
was
to
have
seen
him
and
that
he
would
write
to
him
from
england
a
promise
which
was
kept
one
may
be
sure
gecko
uncovered
his
fuzzy
white
head
and
took
taffy
hand
and
kissed
it
and
thanked
her
warmly
for
her
si
bon
et
sympathique
accueil
then
taffy
all
but
lifted
him
into
the
cab
the
jolly
cabman
saying
ah
bon
connais
bien
celui
là
vous
savez
lui
qui
joue
du
violon
aux
mouches
il
a
soupé
pas
bonheurs

hein
ayez
pas

on
vous
aura
soin

il
joue
joliment
bien
pas
taffy
shook
gecko
hand
and
asked
où
gecko
rue
des
au
cinquième
how
strange
said
taffy
to
his
wife
how
touching
why
that
where
trilby
used
to
live
the
very
number
the
very
floor
oui
oui
said
gecko
waking
up
mansarde
à
trilby
suis
depuis
douze
ans
suis
and
he
laughed
feebly
at
his
mild
little
joke
taffy
told
the
address
to
the
cabman
and
gave
him
five
francs
merci
de

de

la
sorbonne
on
vous
aura

du

soyez
tranquille
ayez
pas
peur
on
y
va
bonsoir
monsieur
et

and
he
clacked
his
whip
and
rattled
away
singing
mon
mari
qui
prends
garde
ne
plus
and
wynne
walked
back
to
the
hotel
which
was
not
far
she
hung
on
to
his
big
arm
and
crept
close
to
him
and
shivered
a
little
it
was
quite
chilly
their
footsteps
were
very
audible
in
the
stillness
otherwise
they
were
both
silent
they
were
tired
yawny
sleepy
and
very
sad
and
each
was
thinking
and
knew
the
other
was
thinking
that
a
week
in
paris
was
just
enough
and
how
nice
it
would
be
in
just
a
few
hours
more
to
hear
the
rooks
cawing
round
their
own
quiet
little
english
country
home
where
three
jolly
boys
would
soon
be
coming
for
the
holidays
and
there
we
will
leave
them
to
their
useful
happy
domestic
existence
than
which
there
is
no
better
that
i
know
of
at
their
time
of
life
and
no
better
time

theirs
