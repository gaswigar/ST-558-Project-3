for
of
physical
and
ethical
science
no
less
than
of
mathematics
and
the
common
round
of
learning
as
well
as
concerning
arts
he
possessed
full
knowledge
and
experience
i
was
spending
the
spring
at
sienna
occupied
all
day
long
with
meticulous
researches
among
the
city
archives
i
used
after
supper
to
take
an
evening
walk
along
the
wild
road
leading
to
monte
oliveto
where
i
would
encounter
in
the
twilight
huge
white
oxen
under
ponderous
yokes
dragging
a
rustic
wain
with
wheels
of
solid
timber
all
unchanged
since
the
times
of
old
evander
the
church
bells
knelled
the
peaceful
ending
of
the
day
while
the
purple
shades
of
night
descended
sadly
and
majestically
on
the
low
chain
of
neighbouring
hills
the
black
squadrons
of
the
rooks
had
already
sought
their
nests
about
the
city
walls
but
relieved
against
the
opalescent
sky
a
single
still
hung
floating
with
motionless
wings
above
a
solitary
ilex
tree
i
moved
forward
to
confront
the
silence
and
solitude
and
the
mild
terrors
that
lowered
before
me
in
the
growing
dusk
the
tide
of
darkness
rose
by
imperceptible
degrees
and
drowned
the
landscape
the
infinite
of
starry
eyes
winked
in
the
sky
while
in
the
gloom
below
the
fireflies
spangled
the
bushes
with
their
trembling
these
living
sparks
cover
all
the
roman
campagna
and
the
plains
of
umbria
and
tuscany
on
may
nights
i
had
watched
them
in
former
days
on
the
appian
way
round
the
tomb
of
cæcilia
metella
their
playground
for
two
thousand
years
now
i
found
them
dancing
the
selfsame
dance
in
the
land
of
catherine
and
of
pia
de
tolomei
at
the
gates
of
sienna
that
most
melancholy
and
most
fascinating
of
cities
all
along
my
path
they
quivered
in
the
bents
and
brushwood
chasing
one
another
and
ever
and
anon
at
the
call
of
desire
tracing
above
the
roadway
the
fiery
arch
of
their
darting
flight
on
the
white
ribbon
of
the
road
in
these
clear
spring
nights
the
only
person
i
used
to
encounter
was
the
reverend
father
adone
doni
who
at
the
time
was
like
myself
working
in
the
old
academy
i
had
taken
an
instant
liking
for
the
cordelier
in
question
a
man
who
grown
grey
in
study
still
preserved
the
cheerful
facile
humour
of
a
simple
unlettered
countryman
he
was
very
willing
to
converse
and
i
greatly
relished
his
bland
speech
his
cultivated
yet
artless
way
of
thought
his
look
of
old
silenus
purged
at
the
baptismal
font
the
play
of
his
passions
at
once
keen
and
refined
the
strange
alluring
personality
that
informed
the
whole
man
assiduous
at
the
library
he
was
also
a
frequent
visitor
to
the
marketplace
halting
for
choice
in
front
of
the
peasant
girls
who
sell
oranges
and
listening
to
their
unconventional
remarks
he
was
learning
he
would
say
from
their
lips
the
true
all
i
knew
of
his
past
life
about
which
he
never
spoke
was
that
he
was
born
at
viterbo
of
a
noble
but
miserably
impoverished
family
that
he
had
studied
the
humanities
and
theology
at
rome
as
a
young
man
had
joined
the
franciscans
of
assisi
where
he
worked
at
the
archives
and
had
had
difficulties
on
questions
of
faith
with
his
ecclesiastical
superiors
indeed
i
thought
i
noticed
myself
a
tendency
in
the
father
towards
peculiar
views
he
was
a
man
of
religion
and
a
man
of
science
but
not
without
certain
eccentricities
under
either
aspect
he
believed
in
god
on
the
evidence
of
holy
scripture
and
in
accordance
with
the
teachings
of
the
church
and
laughed
at
those
simple
philosophers
who
believed
in
him
on
their
own
account
without
being
under
any
obligation
to
do
so
so
far
he
was
well
within
the
bounds
of
orthodoxy
it
was
in
connection
with
the
devil
that
he
professed
peculiar
opinions
he
held
the
devil
to
be
wicked
but
not
absolutely
wicked
and
considered
that
the
fiend
innate
imperfection
must
always
bar
him
from
attaining
to
the
perfection
of
evil
he
believed
he
discerned
some
symptoms
of
goodness
in
the
obscure
manifestations
of
satan
activity
and
without
venturing
to
put
it
in
so
many
words
augured
from
these
the
final
redemption
of
the
pensive
archangel
after
the
consummation
of
the
ages
these
little
eccentricities
of
thought
and
temperament
which
had
separated
him
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
thrown
him
back
upon
a
solitary
existence
afforded
me
amusement
he
had
wits
enough
all
he
lacked
was
common
sense
and
appreciation
of
ordinary
everyday
things
his
life
was
divided
between
phantoms
of
the
past
and
dreams
of
the
future
the
actual
present
was
utterly
foreign
to
his
notions
for
his
political
ideas
these
came
simultaneously
from
antique
santa
maria
degli
angeli
and
the
revolutionary
secret
societies
of
london
and
were
a
combination
of
christian
and
socialist
but
he
was
no
fanatic
his
contempt
for
human
reason
was
too
complete
for
him
to
attach
great
importance
to
his
own
share
in
it
the
government
of
states
appeared
to
him
in
the
light
of
a
huge
practical
joke
at
which
he
would
laugh
quietly
and
composedly
as
a
man
of
taste
should
judges
civil
and
criminal
caused
him
surprise
while
he
looked
on
the
military
classes
in
a
spirit
of
philosophical
toleration
i
was
not
long
in
discovering
some
flagrant
contradictions
in
his
mental
attitude
he
longed
with
all
the
charity
of
his
gentle
heart
for
the
reign
of
universal
peace
yet
at
the
same
time
he
had
a
for
civil
war
and
held
in
high
esteem
that
farinata
degli
uberti
who
loved
his
native
florence
so
boldly
and
so
well
that
he
constrained
her
by
force
and
fraud
making
the
arbia
run
red
with
florentine
blood
the
while
to
will
and
think
precisely
what
he
willed
and
thought
himself
for
all
that
the
reverend
father
adone
doni
was
a
dreamer
of
dreams
it
was
on
the
spiritual
authority
of
chair
he
counted
to
establish
in
this
world
the
kingdom
of
god
he
believed
the
paraclete
was
leading
the
popes
along
a
road
unknown
to
themselves
therefore
he
had
nothing
but
deferential
words
for
the
lamb
of
and
the
of
as
it
was
his
custom
to
designate
pius
ix
and
leo
xiii
respectively
agreeable
as
was
the
reverend
father
conversation
to
me
i
used
out
of
respect
for
his
freedom
of
action
and
my
own
to
avoid
showing
myself
too
assiduous
in
seeking
his
society
inside
the
city
walls
while
on
his
side
he
observed
an
exquisite
discretion
towards
myself
but
in
our
walks
abroad
we
frequently
managed
to
meet
as
if
by
accident
half
a
league
outside
the
porta
romana
the
high
road
traverses
a
hollow
way
between
melancholy
uplands
on
either
hand
relieved
only
by
a
few
gloomy
larches
under
the
clayey
slope
of
the
northern
escarpment
and
close
by
the
roadside
a
dry
well
rears
its
light
canopy
of
open
ironwork
at
this
spot
i
would
encounter
the
reverend
father
adone
doni
almost
every
evening
seated
on
the
coping
of
the
well
his
hands
buried
in
the
sleeves
of
his
gown
gazing
out
with
mild
surprise
into
the
night
the
gathering
dusk
still
left
it
possible
to
make
out
on
his
face
the
habitual
expression
of
timid
daring
and
graceful
irony
which
was
impressed
upon
it
so
profoundly
at
first
we
merely
exchanged
formal
good
wishes
for
each
other
health
peace
and
happiness
then
i
would
take
my
place
by
his
side
on
the
old
stone
that
bore
some
traces
of
carving
it
was
still
possible
in
full
daylight
to
distinguish
a
figure
with
a
head
bigger
than
its
body
and
representing
an
angel
as
seemed
indicated
by
the
wings
the
reverend
father
never
failed
to
say
courteously
welcome
signore
welcome
to
the
well
of
st
clare
one
evening
i
asked
him
the
reason
why
the
well
bore
the
name
of
this
favourite
disciple
of
francis
he
informed
me
it
was
because
of
a
very
edifying
little
miracle
which
for
all
its
charm
had
unfortunately
never
found
a
place
in
the
collection
of
the
i
begged
him
to
oblige
me
by
telling
it
which
he
proceeded
to
do
in
the
following
terms
in
the
days
when
the
poor
man
of
jesus
christ
francis
son
of
bernardone
used
to
journey
from
town
to
town
teaching
holy
simplicity
and
love
he
visited
sienna
in
company
with
brother
leo
the
man
of
his
own
heart
but
the
siennese
a
covetous
and
cruel
generation
true
sons
of
the
on
whose
milk
they
boasted
themselves
to
have
been
suckled
gave
a
sorry
welcome
to
the
holy
man
who
bade
them
take
into
their
house
two
ladies
of
a
perfect
beauty
to
wit
poverty
and
obedience
they
overwhelmed
him
with
obloquy
and
mocking
laughter
and
drove
him
forth
from
the
city
he
left
the
place
in
the
night
by
the
porta
romana
brother
leo
who
tramped
alongside
spoke
up
and
said
to
him
siennese
have
written
on
the
gates
of
their
city
sienna
opens
her
heart
to
you
wider
than
her
doors
and
nevertheless
brother
francis
these
same
men
have
shut
their
hearts
against
us
and
francis
son
of
bernardone
replied
fault
is
with
me
be
sure
of
that
brother
leo
little
lamb
of
god
i
have
not
known
how
to
knock
at
the
doors
of
their
hearts
forcefully
and
skilfully
enough
i
am
far
below
the
fellows
who
set
a
bear
dancing
in
the
great
piazza
for
they
draw
together
a
great
crowd
by
exhibiting
the
rude
coarse
beast
whilst
i
that
had
ladies
of
celestial
fairness
to
show
them
i
have
attracted
no
one
brother
leo
i
charge
you
on
your
holy
obedience
to
say
thus
to
me
brother
francis
you
are
a
poor
man
without
any
merit
whatsoever
a
and
a
very
rock
of
offence
and
all
the
while
brother
leo
was
hesitating
to
obey
the
holy
man
suffered
grievously
within
himself
as
he
went
on
his
murky
way
his
thoughts
turned
to
pleasant
assisi
where
he
had
left
behind
him
his
sons
in
the
spirit
and
clare
daughter
of
his
soul
he
knew
how
clare
was
exposed
to
great
tribulations
for
the
love
of
holy
poverty
and
he
doubted
whether
his
daughter
were
not
sick
of
body
and
soul
and
weary
of
in
the
house
of
damian
so
sore
did
these
doubts
weigh
on
him
that
arrived
at
this
spot
where
the
road
enters
the
hollow
way
between
the
hills
he
seemed
to
feel
his
feet
sink
into
the
ground
at
each
step
he
took
he
dragged
himself
as
far
as
the
well
here
which
was
then
in
its
pristine
beauty
and
full
of
limpid
water
and
fell
exhausted
on
the
where
we
are
seated
at
this
moment
a
long
while
the
man
of
god
remained
bent
over
the
mouth
of
the
well
after
which
lifting
up
his
head
he
said
joyfully
to
brother
leo
think
you
brother
leo
lamb
of
god
i
have
seen
in
the
well
and
brother
leo
answered
francis
you
saw
the
moon
reflected
in
the
well
brother
replied
the
saint
of
god
is
not
our
sister
the
moon
i
saw
in
the
well
but
by
the
lord
the
true
countenance
of
sister
clare
and
so
pure
and
shining
so
bright
with
a
holy
joy
that
all
my
doubts
were
instantly
dispelled
and
it
was
made
plain
to
me
that
our
sister
enjoys
at
this
present
hour
the
full
content
god
accords
his
chosen
vessels
loading
them
with
the
treasures
of
poverty
so
saying
the
good
francis
drank
a
few
drops
of
water
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
arose
refreshed
and
that
is
why
the
name
of
clare
was
given
to
this
well
such
was
the
tale
told
by
the
reverend
father
adone
doni
night
after
night
i
returned
to
find
the
amiable
cordelier
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
mystic
well
i
would
seat
myself
by
his
side
and
he
would
tell
over
for
my
benefit
some
fragment
of
history
known
only
to
himself
he
had
many
delightful
stories
of
the
sort
to
relate
being
better
read
than
any
one
else
in
the
antiquities
of
his
country
these
lived
again
and
grew
bright
and
young
in
his
head
as
if
it
contained
an
intellectual
fountain
of
eternal
youth
ever
fresh
pictures
flowed
from
his
lips
as
he
spoke
the
moonlight
bathed
his
beard
in
a
silver
flood
the
crickets
accompanied
the
narrator
voice
with
the
shrilling
of
their
and
ever
and
anon
his
words
uttered
in
the
softest
of
all
dialects
of
human
speech
would
be
answered
by
the
fluted
plaintive
croaking
of
the
frogs
which
hearkened
from
across
the
road
a
friendly
if
apprehensive
audience
i
left
sienna
towards
the
middle
of
june
and
i
have
never
seen
the
reverend
father
adone
doni
since
he
clings
to
my
memory
like
a
figure
in
a
dream
and
i
have
now
put
into
writing
the
tales
he
told
me
on
the
road
of
monte
oliveto
they
will
be
found
in
the
present
volume
i
only
hope
they
may
have
retained
in
their
new
dress
some
vestiges
of
the
grace
they
had
in

had
raised
himself
by
his
humility
above
his
brethren
and
still
a
young
man
he
governed
the
monastery
of
santa
fiora
wisely
and
well
he
was
devout
and
loved
long
meditations
and
long
prayers
sometimes
he
had
ecstasies
after
the
example
of
his
spiritual
father
francis
he
composed
songs
in
the
vernacular
tongue
in
celebration
of
perfect
love
which
is
the
love
of
god

these
exercises
were
without
fault
whether
of
metre
or
of
meaning
for

not
studied

seven
liberal
arts
at

university
of

now
one
evening
as
he
was
walking
under
the
cloister
arches
he
felt
his
heart
filled
with
trouble
and
sadness
at
the
remembrance
of
a
lady
of
florence
he
had
loved
in
the
first
flower
of
his
youth
ere
the
habit
of

him

pondered

like

angels
ave
maria
but
their
voice
is
lost
in
the
mists
of
heaven
on
the
cloister
wall
yonder
the
master
perugia
delights
to
honour
has
painted
marvellous
well
the
three
marys
contemplating
with
a
love
ineffable
the
body
of
the
saviour
but
the
night
has
veiled
the
tears
in
their
eyes
and
the
dumb
sobs
of
their
mouths
and
i
can
not
weep
with
them
yonder
well
in
the
middle
of
the
cloister
garth
was
covered
but
now
with
doves
that
had
come
to
drink
but
these
are
flown
away
for
they
found
no
water
in
the
hollows
of
the
carven
and
behold
lord
my
soul
falls
silent
like
the
bells
is
darkened
like
the
holy
marys
and
runs
dry
like
the
well
why
jesus
my
god
why
is
my
heart
arid
and
dark
and
dumb
when
thou
art
its
dayspring
and
the
song
of
birds
and
the
flowing
from
the
hills
fra
mino
dreaded
to
return
to
his
cell
and
thinking
prayer
would
dispel
his
melancholy
and
calm
his
disquiet
he
passed
into
the
monastery
church
by
the
low
door
leading
from
the
cloister
silence
and
gloom
filled
the
building
raised
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
on
the
foundations
of
a
ruined
roman
temple
by
the
great
margaritone
he
traversed
the
nave
and
went
and
knelt
in
the
chapel
behind
the
high
altar
dedicated
to
san
michele
whose
legend
was
painted
in
fresco
on
the
wall
but
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
hanging
from
the
vault
was
insufficient
to
show
the
archangel
fighting
with
satan
and
weighing
souls
in
the
balance
only
the
moon
shining
through
the
great
window
threw
a
pale
ray
over
the
tomb
of
san
satiro
where
it
lay
under
an
arcade
to
the
right
of
the
altar
this
tomb
in
shape
resembling
the
great
vats
used
at
vintage
time
was
more
ancient
than
the
church
and
in
all
respects
similar
to
a
pagan
sarcophagus
except
that
the
sign
of
the
cross
was
to
be
seen
traced
in
three
different
places
on
its
marble
sides
fra
mino
remained
for
hours
prostrate
before
the
altar
but
he
found
it
impossible
to
pray
and
at
midnight
felt
himself
weighed
down
under
the
same
heaviness
that
overcame
jesus
christ
disciples
in
the
garden
of
gethsemane
and
lo
as
he
lay
there
without
courage
or
counsel
he
saw
as
it
were
a
white
cloud
rise
above
the
tomb
of
san
satiro
and
presently
observed
that
this
cloud
was
made
up
of
a
multitude
of
cloudlets
of
which
each
one
was
a
woman
they
floated
in
the
dim
air
and
through
their
light
raiment
shone
the
whiteness
of
their
light
limbs
then
fra
mino
saw
how
among
them
were
young
men
who
were
chasing
them
these
were
naked
and
nothing
hid
the
terrifying
ardour
of
their
desires
and
the
nymphs
fled
away
from
them
while
beneath
their
racing
steps
there
sprang
up
flowery
meadows
and
brooks
of
water
each
time
a
put
out
his
hand
to
seize
one
of
them
a
sallow
would
shoot
up
suddenly
to
hide
the
nymph
in
its
hollow
trunk
as
in
a
cave
and
the
grey
leaves
shivered
with
light
murmurings
and
spurts
of
mocking
laughter
when
all
the
women
were
hidden
in
the
sallows
their
lovers
sitting
on
the
grass
of
the
meadows
breathed
in
their
flutes
of
reeds
and
drew
from
them
sounds
to
destroy
the
peace
of
any
creature
of
the
earth
the
nymphs
were
fascinated
and
soon
began
to
peep
out
between
the
branches
and
one
by
one
deserting
the
shady
covert
drew
near
under
the
irresistible
attraction
of
the
music
then
the
rushed
upon
them
with
a
demoniac
fury
folded
in
the
arms
of
their
ruthless
assailants
the
nymphs
strove
to
keep
up
a
while
longer
their
raillery
and
loud
laughter
but
the
mirth
died
on
their
lips
with
heads
thrown
back
and
eyes
swooning
with
joy
and
terror
they
could
only
call
upon
their
mother
or
scream
a
shrill
you
are
killing
me
or
keep
a
sullen
silence
fra
mino
longed
to
turn
his
head
but
he
could
not
and
his
eyes
remained
wide
open
in
spite
of
himself
meanwhile
the
nymphs
winding
their
arms
about
the
loins
fell
to
biting
and
caressing
and
provoking
their
hairy
lovers
and
body
intertwined
with
body
they
enfolded
and
bathed
them
in
their
tender
flesh
that
was
sweeter
and
softer
and
more
living
than
the
water
of
the
brook
which
ran
by
them
under
the
sallows
at
the
sight
fra
mino
fell
in
mind
and
intention
into
deadly
sin
he
desired
to
be
one
of
these
demons
half
men
and
half
beasts
and
hold
to
his
bosom
after
their
carnal
fashion
the
fair
lady
of
florence
he
had
loved
in
the
flower
of
his
years
and
who
was
now
dead
but
already
the
were
scattering
through
the
some
were
busied
gathering
honey
in
the
hollow
trunks
of
oaks
others
carving
reeds
into
the
shape
of
flutes
or
butting
one
against
the
other
crashing
their
horned
brows
together
meantime
the
bodies
of
the
nymphs
sweet
wrecks
of
love
lay
motionless
strewing
the
meadows
fra
mino
lay
groaning
on
the
chapel
flags
for
so
fierce
had
been
the
desire
of
sin
within
him
that
now
he
was
filled
full
of
bitter
shame
at
his
own
weakness
suddenly
one
of
the
nymphs
chancing
as
she
lay
to
turn
her
eyes
upon
him
cried
out
a
man
a
man
and
pointing
him
out
to
her
companions
look
sisters
yonder
is
no
he
has
no
flute
of
reed
beside
him
nor
yet
do
i
recognize
him
for
the
master
of
one
of
those
rustic
farmsteads
whose
sloping
to
the
beneath
the
vines
is
guarded
by
a
priapus
hewn
out
of
a
stump
of
beech
what
would
he
among
us
if
he
is
neither
nor
nor
gardener
his
looks
are
harsh
and
gloomy
and
i
can
not
read
in
his
eyes
the
love
of
the
gods
and
goddesses
that
people
the
wide
sky
the
woods
and
mountains
he
wears
a
barbarous
habit
perhaps
he
is
a
scythian
let
us
approach
the
stranger
my
sisters
and
make
sure
he
is
not
come
as
a
foe
to
sully
our
fountains
hew
down
our
trees
tear
open
our
and
betray
to
cruel
men
the
mystery
of
our
happy
lurking
places
come
with
me
mnaïs
come
ægle
neæra
and
melibœa
on
on
returned
mnaïs
on
with
our
arms
in
hand
on
on
all
cried
in
chorus
then
fra
mino
saw
them
spring
up
and
gather
great
handfuls
of
roses
and
advance
upon
him
in
a
long
line
each
armed
with
roses
and
thorns
but
the
distance
that
separated
them
from
him
which
at
first
had
seemed
very
short
for
indeed
he
thought
almost
to
touch
them
and
felt
their
breath
on
his
face
appeared
suddenly
to
increase
and
he
watched
them
coming
as
though
from
out
a
forest
impatient
to
be
at
him
they
began
to
run
threatening
him
with
their
cruel
flowers
while
menaces
flew
from
their
lips
and
lo
as
they
came
nearer
a
change
was
wrought
in
them
at
each
step
they
lost
something
of
their
grace
and
beauty
and
the
bloom
of
their
youth
faded
as
fast
as
the
roses
in
their
hands
first
their
eyes
grew
hollow
and
the
mouth
fell
in
the
neck
but
now
so
pure
and
white
hung
in
great
hideous
folds
and
grey
draggled
over
their
wrinkled
brows
on
they
came
and
their
eyes
were
circled
with
red
their
lips
drawn
in
upon
the
toothless
gums
on
they
came
carrying
dead
roses
in
their
arms
which
were
black
and
writhen
as
the
old
vine
stocks
the
peasants
of
chianti
burn
for
firewood
in
the
winter
nights
on
they
came
with
shaking
heads
and
palsied
thighs
tottering
and
trembling
arrived
at
the
spot
where
fra
mino
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
with
affright
they
were
no
better
than
a
crowd
of
horrid
witches
bald
and
bearded
nose
and
chin
touching
and
bosoms
hanging
loose
and
flabby
they
came
crowding
round
him
ah
ha
the
pretty
darling
cried
one
he
is
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
his
heart
beats
like
a
hare
the
dogs
are
snapping
at
ægle
sister
mine
say
what
must
be
done
with
him
neæra
mine
ægle
replied
why
we
must
open
his
breast
tear
out
his
heart
and
put
a
sponge
in
its
place
instead
not
so
said
melibœa
that
were
making
him
pay
too
dear
for
his
curiosity
and
the
pleasure
he
has
had
in
surprising
our
frolic
enough
for
this
time
to
inflict
a
light
chastisement
say
shall
we
give
him
a
good
whipping
straightway
surrounding
the
monk
the
sisters
dragged
his
gown
above
his
head
and
belaboured
him
with
the
handfuls
of
thorns
they
still
held
the
blood
was
beginning
to
come
when
neæra
signed
to
them
to
stop
enough
she
cried
he
is
my
gallant
i
tell
you
i
saw
him
just
now
casting
tender
eyes
at
me
i
would
content
his
wishes
and
grant
him
my
favours
without
more
delay
she
smiled
alluringly
and
a
long
black
tooth
projecting
from
her
mouth
tickled
his
nostril
she
murmured
softly
come
come
my
adonis
then
suddenly
wild
with
rage
fie
fie
his
senses
are
benumbed
his
coldness
offends
my
charms
he
scorns
me
avenge
me
comrades
mnaïs
ægle
melibœa
avenge
your
sister
at
this
appeal
one
and
all
lifting
their
thorny
whips
fell
to
scourging
him
so
savagely
that
fra
mino
body
was
soon
one
wound
from
head
to
toe
now
and
again
they
would
stop
to
cough
and
spit
only
to
begin
afresh
plying
their
whips
more
vigorously
than
ever
only
sheer
weariness
induced
them
to
leave
off
i
hope
neæra
then
said
next
time
he
will
not
do
me
the
undeserved
insult
i
still
blush
to
remember
we
will
spare
his
life
but
if
he
betrays
the
secret
of
our
sports
and
pleasures
we
will
surely
kill
him
to
you
my
pretty
boy
so
saying
the
old
woman
suddenly
squatted
down
over
the
monk
and
drowned
him
in
a
torrent
of
very
filthy
liquid
each
sister
followed
suit
and
did
the
like
then
one
after
the
other
they
the
tomb
of
san
satiro
slipping
in
through
a
tiny
crack
in
the
lid
leaving
their
victim
lying
full
length
in
a
stream
of
a
most
intolerable
stench
when
the
last
had
disappeared
the
cock
crew
then
fra
mino
at
last
found
himself
able
to
rise
from
the
earth
broken
with
fatigue
and
pain
benumbed
with
cold
shuddering
with
fever
half
stifled
with
the
foul
exhalations
of
the
poisonous
liquor
he
set
his
clothing
straight
and
dragged
himself
to
his
cell
just
as
day
broke
from
that
night
on
fra
mino
never
had
a
moment
peace
the
recollection
of
what
he
had
seen
in
the
chapel
of
san
michele
above
san
satiro
tomb
disturbed
him
in
the
church
services
and
in
all
his
pious
exercises
he
trembled
when
he
visited
the
church
along
with
his
fellows
and
as
his
turn
came
according
to
the
rule
to
kiss
the
pavement
of
the
choir
his
lips
shuddered
to
encounter
the
traces
of
the
nymphs
presence
and
he
would
murmur
o
my
saviour
dost
not
thou
hear
me
say
what
thou
didst
thyself
say
to
thy
father
lead
us
not
we
beseech
thee
into
temptation
at
first
he
had
thought
of
sending
to
the
lord
bishop
an
account
of
what
he
had
witnessed
but
on
riper
reflexion
he
became
convinced
it
were
better
to
meditate
at
leisure
on
these
extraordinary
events
and
only
divulge
them
after
a
more
exhaustive
study
of
all
the
circumstances
besides
it
so
happened
that
the
lord
bishop
allied
with
the
guelphs
of
pisa
against
the
ghibellines
of
florence
was
at
that
moment
waging
war
with
such
right
good
will
that
for
a
whole
month
he
had
not
so
much
as
unbuckled
his
cuirass
and
that
is
why
without
saying
a
word
to
anyone
fra
mino
made
profound
researches
on
the
tomb
of
san
satiro
and
the
chapel
containing
it
deeply
versed
in
the
knowledge
of
books
he
investigated
many
texts
both
ancient
and
modern
yet
found
no
glimmer
of
enlightenment
in
any
of
them
indeed
the
only
effect
of
the
works
on
magic
which
he
studied
was
to
double
his
uncertainty
one
morning
after
labouring
all
the
night
as
was
his
wont
he
was
fain
to
refresh
his
heart
with
a
walk
in
the
fields
he
took
the
hilly
path
which
winding
between
the
vines
and
the
elms
they
are
wedded
to
leads
to
a
wood
of
myrtles
and
olives
sacred
in
old
days
to
the
roman
gods
his
feet
bathed
in
the
wet
grass
his
brow
refreshed
by
the
dew
that
distilled
from
the
pointed
leaves
of
the
guelder
roses
fra
mino
wandered
long
in
the
forest
till
he
came
upon
a
spring
over
which
the
wild
tamarisks
gently
swayed
their
light
foliage
and
the
downy
clusters
of
their
pink
berries
lower
down
amid
the
willows
where
the
water
formed
a
wider
pool
herons
stood
motionless
while
the
smaller
birds
sang
sweetly
in
the
branching
myrtles
the
scent
of
mint
rose
moist
and
fragrant
from
the
ground
and
the
grass
was
spangled
with
the
flowers
of
which
our
lord
said
that
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these
fra
mino
sat
down
on
a
mossy
stone
and
praising
god
who
made
the
heavens
and
the
dew
he
fell
to
pondering
the
hidden
mysteries
of
nature
now
the
remembrance
of
all
he
had
seen
in
the
chapel
of
san
michele
never
left
his
thoughts
so
he
sat
meditating
his
head
between
his
hands
wondering
for
the
thousandth
time
what
the
dream
might
signify
for
indeed
he
said
to
himself
such
a
vision
must
needs
have
a
meaning
it
should
even
have
several
which
it
behoves
to
discover
whether
by
sudden
illumination
or
by
dint
of
an
exact
applying
of
the
scholastic
rules
and
i
deem
that
in
this
especial
case
the
poets
i
studied
at
bologna
such
as
horace
the
satirist
and
statius
should
likewise
be
of
great
help
to
me
seeing
many
verities
are
intermingled
with
their
fables
after
long
pondering
these
thoughts
within
his
breast
and
others
more
subtle
still
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
perceived
he
was
not
alone
leaning
against
the
cavernous
trunk
of
an
ancient
an
old
man
stood
gazing
at
the
sky
through
the
leaves
and
smiling
to
himself
above
his
hoary
brow
peeped
out
two
shorty
blunt
horns
his
nose
was
flat
with
wide
nostrils
and
from
his
chin
depended
a
white
beard
through
which
were
visible
the
rugged
muscles
of
the
neck
a
shaggy
growth
of
hair
covered
his
breast
while
from
the
thighs
downwards
his
limbs
showed
a
thick
fleece
that
trailed
down
to
his
cloven
feet
he
held
to
his
lips
a
flute
of
reed
from
which
he
drew
a
feeble
sound
of
music
then
he
began
to
sing
in
a
voice
that
left
the
words
barely
distinguishable
laughing
she
fled
her
teeth
in
the
golden
grape
after
i
sped
and
clasping
her
flying
shape
i
quenched
my
drouth
on
the
fruit
at
her
mouth
astounded
at
these
strange
sights
and
sounds
fra
mino
crossed
himself
still
the
old
man
showed
no
mark
of
confusion
but
cast
a
long
and
artless
look
at
the
monk
amid
the
deep
wrinkles
that
scored
his
face
the
clear
blue
eyes
sparkled
like
the
waters
of
a
spring
through
the
rugged
bark
of
a
grove
of
oaks
man
or
beast
shrilled
mino
i
command
you
in
the
name
of
the
saviour
to
say
who
you
are
my
son
replied
the
old
man
i
am
san
satiro
speak
not
so
loud
for
fear
of
frightening
the
birds
then
fra
mino
resumed
in
a
quieter
tone
forasmuch
old
man
as
you
shrank
not
before
the
dread
sign
of
the
cross
i
can
not
hold
you
to
be
a
demon
or
some
foul
spirit
escaped
out
of
hell
but
if
verily
and
indeed
you
are
a
man
as
you
say
you
are
or
rather
the
soul
of
a
man
sanctified
by
the
deeds
of
a
good
life
and
by
the
merits
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
expound
i
pray
you
the
mystery
of
your
goat
horns
and
your
shaggy
limbs
ending
in
those
black
cloven
hoofs
at
the
question
the
old
man
lifted
up
his
arms
towards
heaven
and
said
my
son
the
nature
of
men
and
animals
of
plants
and
stones
is
the
secret
of
the
immortal
gods
and
i
know
as
little
as
yourself
what
is
the
reason
of
these
horns
wherewith
my
brow
is
decked
and
which
the
nymphs
used
in
olden
days
to
wind
about
with
garlands
of
flowers
i
can
not
tell
you
the
meaning
of
the
two
wrinkled
folds
that
droop
from
my
neck
nor
why
i
have
the
feet
of
a
wanton
goat
but
i
would
have
you
know
my
son
there
was
once
in
these
woods
a
race
of
women
having
horned
brows
like
mine
and
shaggy
thighs
yet
were
their
bosoms
round
and
white
and
their
belly
and
polished
loins
shone
in
the
light
the
sun
was
young
then
and
loved
to
fleck
them
with
his
golden
arrows
as
they
lay
beneath
the
shady
foliage
they
were
very
fair
my
son
but
alas
they
have
vanished
from
the
woods
every
one
my
mates
have
perished
likewise
and
i
am
left
lonely
the
last
of
my
tribe
i
would
fain
know
your
age
old
man
and
your
lineage
and
country
my
son
i
was
born
of
the
earth
long
ere
jupiter
had
dethroned
saturn
and
my
eyes
have
looked
upon
the
flowery
freshness
of
the
world
not
yet
had
the
human
race
emerged
from
the
clay
alone
with
me
the
dancing
satyr
girls
set
the
ground
ringing
with
the
rhythmic
beat
of
their
double
hoofs
they
were
taller
and
stronger
and
fairer
than
either
nymphs
or
women
and
their
ampler
loins
received
abundantly
the
seed
of
the
of
earth
under
the
reign
of
jupiter
the
nymphs
began
to
inhabit
fountains
and
forests
and
mountains
while
the
fauns
accoupling
with
the
nymphs
formed
bands
that
roamed
the
woods
together
meantime
i
spent
a
happy
life
tasting
at
will
the
clusters
of
the
wild
grapes
and
the
lips
of
the
laughing
i
enjoyed
deep
and
restful
slumbers
amid
the
lush
grass
and
i
would
celebrate
on
my
rustic
flute
jupiter
saturn
successor
for
it
is
of
my
nature
to
praise
the
gods
masters
of
the
world
alas
and
i
am
grown
old
for
i
am
but
a
god
and
the
centuries
have
blanched
the
hairs
of
my
head
and
of
my
bosom
and
have
extinguished
the
fire
of
my
reins
i
was
already
heavily
weighted
with
years
when
the
great
pan
died
and
jupiter
meeting
the
same
lot
he
had
laid
upon
saturn
was
dethroned
by
the
galilean
since
then
i
have
dragged
out
an
life
so
feeble
and
languid
that
at
last
it
fell
out
i
died
and
was
entombed
and
verily
i
am
now
but
the
shadow
of
myself
if
i
still
exist
a
little
it
is
because
nothing
ever
really
perishes
and
none
is
suffered
altogether
to
die
out
death
must
never
be
more
perfect
and
complete
than
life
beings
lost
in
the
ocean
of
things
are
like
the
waves
you
may
watch
my
child
rising
and
falling
in
the
adriatic
sea
they
have
neither
beginning
nor
end
they
are
born
and
die
insensibly
insensibly
as
the
waves
my
soul
passes
a
faint
memory
of
the
satyr
girls
of
the
golden
age
yet
brightens
my
eyes
and
on
my
lips
float
soundlessly
the
ancient
hymns
of
praise
this
said
he
fell
silent
fra
mino
gazed
at
the
old
man
and
knew
him
that
he
was
a
phantom
and
nothing
more
yes
you
may
indeed
be
a
he
told
him
gravely
without
being
a
demon
is
not
a
thing
wholly
incredible
such
creatures
as
god
framed
to
have
no
part
in
adam
heritage
these
can
no
more
be
damned
than
they
can
be
saved
i
can
never
believe
that
the
centaur
cheiron
who
was
wiser
than
men
are
is
suffering
eternal
torments
in
the
belly
of
leviathan
a
traveller
who
penetrated
once
into
limbo
relates
how
he
saw
him
seated
in
a
grassy
spot
and
conversing
with
rhipheus
the
most
righteous
man
of
all
the
trojans
others
indeed
affirm
that
holy
paradise
itself
has
been
opened
to
admit
rhipheus
of
troy
any
way
the
case
is
one
where
doubt
is
not
unlawful
but
you
lied
old
man
when
you
told
me
you
were
a
saint
who
are
not
so
much
even
as
a
man
the
made
answer
my
son
when
i
was
young
i
was
no
more
used
to
lie
than
the
sheep
whose
milk
i
sucked
or
the
with
which
i
would
butt
in
the
joy
of
my
strength
and
beauty
lies
were
unknown
in
those
times
nor
had
the
sheep
fleece
yet
learned
to
assume
factitious
hues
and
my
soul
has
remained
unchanged
from
that
day
to
this
see
i
go
naked
as
in
the
golden
age
of
saturn
and
my
spirit
is
veiled
as
little
as
my
body
i
am
no
liar
and
why
indeed
should
you
deem
it
a
thing
so
extraordinary
my
son
that
i
have
become
a
saint
in
the
train
of
the
galilean
albeit
no
offspring
of
the
first
mother
some
name
eve
and
others
pyrrha
and
whom
it
is
very
meet
to
reverence
under
either
title
nay
for
that
matter
neither
is
michael
i
know
him
and
at
times
we
have
talks
together
he
and
i
he
tells
me
of
the
days
when
he
was
an
on
mount
garganus
but
here
fra
mino
interrupted
the
satyr
i
can
not
suffer
you
to
say
michael
was
an
because
he
guarded
the
cattle
of
a
man
whose
name
was
garganus
the
same
as
the
mountain
but
there
i
would
fain
learn
old
man
how
you
were
made
a
saint
listen
replied
the
and
your
curiosity
shall
be
satisfied
when
men
coming
from
the
east
proclaimed
in
the
fair
vale
of
arno
how
that
the
galilean
had
dethroned
jupiter
they
hewed
down
the
oaks
whereon
the
country
folk
were
used
to
hang
up
little
goddesses
of
clay
and
votive
tablets
they
planted
crosses
over
against
the
holy
fountains
and
forbade
the
shepherds
any
more
to
carry
to
the
grottos
of
the
nymphs
offerings
of
wine
and
milk
and
cakes
naturally
enough
this
angered
all
the
tribe
of
fauns
and
pans
and
sylvan
genii
and
in
their
wrath
these
attacked
the
apostles
of
the
new
god
when
the
holy
men
were
asleep
of
nights
on
their
bed
of
dry
leaves
the
nymphs
would
steal
up
and
pull
their
beards
while
the
young
fauns
slipping
into
their
stable
would
pluck
out
hairs
from
their
tail
in
vain
i
sought
to
disarm
their
simple
malice
and
exhort
them
to
submission
children
i
would
warn
them
days
of
easy
gaiety
and
light
laughter
are
gone
by
but
they
were
reckless
and
would
not
hearken
and
a
sore
price
they
paid
for
their
heedlessness
but
for
myself
had
i
not
seen
the
reign
of
saturn
come
to
an
end
and
i
deemed
it
natural
and
just
that
jupiter
should
perish
in
his
turn
i
was
prepared
to
acquiesce
in
the
downfall
of
the
great
old
gods
and
offered
no
resistance
to
the
emissaries
of
the
galilean
nay
i
did
them
sundry
little
services
better
acquainted
than
they
with
the
forest
paths
i
would
gather
mulberries
and
sloes
and
lay
them
on
leaves
at
the
threshold
of
their
grotto
and
make
them
little
presents
of
eggs
then
if
they
were
building
a
cabin
i
would
carry
the
timber
and
stones
for
them
on
my
back
in
gratitude
they
poured
water
on
my
brow
invoking
on
my
head
the
peace
of
jesus
christ
so
i
lived
with
them
and
in
their
way
and
those
who
loved
them
loved
me
as
they
were
honoured
so
was
i
and
my
sanctity
seemed
as
great
as
theirs
i
have
told
you
my
son
i
was
already
very
old
in
those
days
the
sun
had
scarce
heat
enough
to
warm
my
benumbed
limbs
i
was
no
better
than
an
old
rotten
tree
that
has
lost
its
crown
of
fresh
leaves
and
singing
birds
each
returning
autumn
brought
my
end
nearer
and
one
morning
they
found
me
stretched
motionless
by
the
roadside
the
bishop
followed
by
his
priests
and
all
the
people
celebrated
my
obsequies
then
i
was
laid
in
a
great
tomb
of
white
marble
marked
in
three
places
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
bearing
carved
on
the
slab
in
front
the
words
within
a
garland
of
roses
in
those
times
my
son
tombs
were
erected
along
the
roadsides
mine
was
placed
two
miles
out
from
the
city
on
the
florence
road
a
young
grew
up
over
it
and
threw
its
shadow
across
it
dappled
with
sunlight
and
full
of
bird
songs
and
twitterings
freshness
and
joy
near
by
a
fountain
flowed
over
a
bed
of
where
the
boys
and
girls
came
laughing
merrily
to
bathe
together
it
was
a
charming
spot
and
soon
a
holy
one
as
well
thither
young
mothers
would
bring
their
babies
and
let
them
touch
the
marble
of
the
tomb
that
they
might
grow
up
sturdy
and
straight
in
all
their
limbs
the
country
folk
one
and
all
believed
that
infants
presented
at
my
grave
must
one
day
surpass
their
fellows
in
strength
and
courage
this
is
why
they
brought
me
all
the
flower
of
the
gallant
tuscan
race
moreover
the
peasants
often
led
their
asses
thither
in
hopes
of
making
them
prolific
my
memory
was
revered
each
year
at
the
return
of
spring
the
bishop
used
to
come
with
his
clergy
to
pray
over
my
bones
and
i
could
watch
far
away
through
the
meadow
grass
the
slow
approach
of
cross
and
candle
in
procession
the
scarlet
canopy
and
the
chanting
acolytes
thus
it
was
my
son
in
the
days
of
good
king
berengar
meantime
the
satyrs
and
the
satyr
girls
the
fauns
and
nymphs
dragged
out
a
wretched
wandering
life
no
more
altars
of
meadow
turf
for
them
no
more
wreaths
of
flowers
no
more
offerings
of
milk
and
wheat
and
honey
only
now
and
then
at
long
intervals
some
would
furtively
lay
a
tiny
cheese
on
the
threshold
of
the
sacred
grot
whose
entrance
was
almost
blocked
now
with
thorns
and
brambles
but
it
was
merely
the
rabbits
and
squirrels
came
to
eat
these
poor
dainties
the
nymphs
were
dwellers
in
distant
forests
and
gloomy
caves
driven
forth
of
their
old
homes
by
the
apostles
from
the
east
and
to
hinder
their
ever
returning
more
the
priests
of
the
galilean
god
poured
over
trees
and
stones
a
charmed
water
and
pronounced
magic
words
and
set
up
crosses
where
roads
met
in
the
forest
for
the
galilean
my
son
is
learned
in
the
art
of
incantations
better
than
saturn
better
than
jupiter
he
knows
the
virtue
of
formularies
and
mystic
signs
thus
the
poor
rustic
divinities
could
no
more
find
refuge
in
their
sacred
woods
the
company
of
satyrs
that
beat
of
yore
their
mother
earth
with
sounding
hoof
was
but
a
cloud
of
pale
dumb
shadows
trailing
along
the
like
the
morning
mist
the
sun
melts
and
dispels
buffeted
as
by
a
fierce
wind
by
the
wrath
of
heaven
their
spectral
forms
would
be
whirled
eddying
all
day
long
in
the
dust
of
the
roads
the
night
on
the
contrary
was
somewhat
less
hostile
to
them
night
is
not
wholly
the
galilean
god
he
shares
its
dominion
with
the
devils
as
the
shades
of
night
descended
from
the
hills
fauns
and
nymphs
and
pans
came
huddling
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
tombs
along
the
roadside
and
there
under
the
kindly
empire
of
the
infernal
powers
would
enjoy
a
brief
repose
of
all
the
tombs
they
liked
mine
the
best
as
that
of
a
reverend
ancestor
of
their
own
soon
all
assembled
under
that
part
of
the
cornice
which
giving
south
was
quite
free
of
moss
and
always
dry
thither
the
airy
folk
came
flying
every
evening
as
surely
as
doves
to
the
dovecote
they
easily
found
room
grown
tiny
now
and
light
as
the
chaff
that
scuds
before
the
for
my
own
part
sallying
out
from
my
quiet
i
would
sit
down
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
them
under
shelter
of
the
marble
and
in
a
feeble
whistling
voice
sing
them
songs
of
the
days
of
saturn
and
jupiter
then
they
would
remember
the
happy
times
gone
by
for
ever
under
the
eyes
of
diana
they
would
join
to
make
a
show
of
their
ancient
pastimes
and
the
belated
traveller
would
seem
to
see
the
night
mists
of
the
meadows
in
the
moonlight
mimic
the
intertwining
limbs
of
lovers
and
in
very
deed
they
were
little
more
than
a
fleeting
fog
themselves
the
cold
tried
them
sorely
one
night
when
the
snow
shrouded
the
fields
the
nymphs
ægle
neæra
mnaïs
and
melibœa
glided
through
the
cracks
in
the
marble
into
the
narrow
gloomy
chamber
where
i
dwell
their
comrades
crowded
after
in
their
train
and
the
fauns
dashing
in
pursuit
of
them
quickly
joined
them
too
my
house
became
their
house
we
scarcely
ever
left
it
except
to
visit
the
woods
when
the
night
was
fine
and
clear
even
then
they
would
make
haste
to
return
at
the
first
for
you
must
know
my
son
that
alone
of
the
horned
race
i
have
leave
to
appear
on
this
earth
by
the
light
of
day
it
is
a
privilege
attached
to
my
saintship
my
tomb
now
inspired
more
veneration
than
ever
among
the
country
people
and
every
day
young
mothers
came
to
present
their
nurslings
to
me
lifting
the
naked
babes
in
their
arms
when
the
sons
of
francis
settled
in
the
land
and
built
a
monastery
on
the
they
craved
the
bishop
leave
to
transfer
my
monument
to
their
church
and
there
keep
it
as
a
sacred
thing
the
favour
was
granted
and
i
was
borne
in
great
pomp
to
the
chapel
of
san
michele
where
i
repose
to
this
day
my
rustic
family
was
carried
thither
along
with
me
it
was
a
signal
honour
but
i
confess
i
regretted
the
broad
highway
where
i
could
watch
at
dawn
the
peasant
women
carrying
on
their
heads
their
basketfuls
of
grapes
and
figs
and
red
aubergines
time
has
hardly
softened
my
regret
and
i
would
i
were
still
beneath
the
on
the
sacred
way
such
is
my
life
ended
the
old
satyr
it
flows
on
pleasantly
gentle
and
unobtrusive
down
all
the
ages
of
the
world
if
a
touch
of
sadness
mingles
with
the
joy
of
it
is
because
the
gods
have
willed
it
so
oh
my
son
let
us
praise
the
gods
masters
of
the
universe
fra
mino
stood
thinking
a
while
then
he
said
i
understand
now
the
meaning
of
what
i
saw
during
that
evil
night
in
the
chapel
of
san
michele
still
one
point
remains
dark
to
my
mind
tell
me
why
old
man
the
nymphs
who
dwell
with
you
and
couple
with
the
fauns
changed
into
old
women
of
squalid
ugliness
when
they
came
nigh
me
alas
my
son
answered
the
saint
time
spares
neither
men
nor
gods
these
last
are
immortal
only
in
the
imagination
of
the
race
of
men
in
reality
they
suffer
the
penalties
of
age
and
verge
as
the
centuries
go
by
towards
irreparable
decay
nymphs
grow
old
as
well
as
women
no
rose
but
turns
into
an
arid
hip
at
last
no
nymph
but
ends
as
an
ugly
witchwife
watching
as
you
did
the
frolic
of
my
little
household
you
saw
how
the
memory
of
their
bygone
youth
yet
beautifies
the
nymphs
and
fauns
in
the
moment
of
their
loves
and
how
their
ardour
reanimated
an
instant
can
reanimate
their
charms
but
the
ruin
of
centuries
shows
again
directly
after
alas
alas
the
race
of

another

if
what

you

won
to

by

ways
if

which
pollute
with
their
indecencies
the

the

without

vanished
softly
away
into
thin
air
seated
on
a
mossy
stone
beside
the
spring
fra
mino
pondered
the
discourse
he
had
just
listened
to
and
found
it
contained
along
with
some
passages
impenetrably
obscure
others
that
were
full
of
clearness
and
enlightenment
this
satyr
saint
he
reflected
maybe
likened
to
the
sibyl
who
in
the
pantheon
of
the
false
gods
proclaimed
the
coming
redeemer
to
the
nations
the
mire
of
falsehoods
yet
clings
about
the
hoofs
of
his
feet

his
forehead
is
uplifted
to
the
light
and
his
lips
confess
the
truth
as
the
shadow
of
the
beeches
was
lengthening
along
the
grassy
the
monk
rose
up
from
his
stone
and
began
to
descend
the
narrow
path
that
led
to
the
house
of
the
sons
of
francis
but
he
dared
not
let
his
eyes
rest
on
the
flowers
sleeping
on
the
surface
of
the
pools
for
he
saw
in
them
the
likeness
of
the
wanton
nymphs

got
back
to
his
cell
at
the
moment
when
the
bells
were
sounding

was
a
small
white
chamber
furnished
simply
with
a
bed
a
stool
and
one
of
the
high
desks

painted
years

in

manner

holy
marys
at
the
foot
of

as

some
were

others
profane
for

was
a

to
the

he
might
praise
god
in

and
blessed
the
good

having
prophesied

the

could
be

from
it

above
the
purple
hills
ensconced
in
this
pleasant
tomb
of
his
life
and
longings
mino
sat
down
before
the
narrow
desk
with
its
two
shelves
at
top
where
he
was
accustomed
to
devote
himself
to
his
studies
then
dipping
his
reed
in
the
inkhorn
fastened
to
the
side
of
the
little
coffer
that
held
his
sheets
of
parchment
his
brushes
and
his
colours
and
gold
dust
he
besought
the
flies
in
the
name
of
the
lord
not
to
annoy
him
and
began
to
write
the
account
of
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
in
the
chapel
of
san
michele
during
his
night
of
torment
as
well
as
on
the
day
just
done
in
the
woods
by
the
stream
side
and
first
of
all
he
traced
these
lines
on
the
parchment
true
record
of
those
things
which
fra
mino
of
the
order
of
friars
minors
saw
and
heard
and
which
he
doth
here
relate
for
the
instruction
of
the
faithful
to
the
praise
of
jesus
christ
and
the
glory
of
the
blessed
and
humble
poor
man
of
christ
francis
then
he
set
down
in
order
in
writing
without
omitting
aught
all
he
had
noted
of
the
nymphs
that
turned
into
witches
and
the
old
man
with
horns
on
his
brow
whose
voice
quavered
in
the
woods
like
a
last
sigh
of
the
classic
flute
and
a
first
prelude
of
the
christian
harp
while
he
wrote
the
birds
sang
and
night
closed
in
slowly
blotting
out
the
bright
colours
of
the
day
the
monk
lighted
his
lamp
and
went
on
with
his
writing
as
he
recounted
each
several
marvel
he
had
made
acquaintance
with
he
carefully
expounded
its
literal
and
its
spiritual
signification
all
according
to
the
rules
of
rhetoric
and
theology
and
just
as
men
fence
about
cities
with
walls
and
towers
to
make
them
strong
so
he
supported
all
his
arguments
with
texts
of
scripture
he
concluded
from
the
singular
revelations
he
had
received
firstly
that
jesus
christ
is
lord
of
all
creatures
and
is
god
of
the
satyrs
and
the
pans
as
well
as
of
men
this
is
why
jerome
saw
in
the
desert
centaurs
that
confessed
jesus
christ
secondly
that
god
had
communicated
to
the
pagans
certain
glimmerings
of
light
to
the
end
they
might
be
saved
likewise
the
sibyls
for
instance
the
cumæan
the
egyptian
and
the
delphic
did
these
not
foreshadow
amid
the
darkness
of
the
gentiles
the
holy
cradle
the
rods
the
reed
the
crown
of
thorns
and
the
cross
itself
for
which
reason
augustine
admitted
the
erythræan
sibyl
into
the
city
of
god
fra
mino
gave
thanks
to
god
for
having
taught
him
so
much
learning
and
a
great
joy
flooded
his
heart
to
think
virgil
was
among
the
elect
and
he
wrote
gleefully
at
the
bottom
of
the
last
leaf
endeth
the
apocalypse
of
brother
mino
the
poor
man
of
jesus
christ
i
have
seen
the
aureole
of
the
blessed
saints
crowning
the
horned
forehead
of
the
satyr
in
token
that
jesus
christ
hath
redeemed
from
the
shades
of
limbo
the
sages
and
poets
of
the
night
was
already
far
spent
when
having
finished
his
task
fra
mino
stretched
himself
upon
his
bed
to
snatch
a
little
repose
just
as
he
was
dropping
asleep
an
old
woman
came
in
at
the
window
riding
on
a
moonbeam
he
recognized
her
instantly
for
the
ugliest
of
the
witches
he
had
seen
in
the
chapel
of
san
michele
my
sweet
she
said
addressing
him
what
have
you
been
doing
this
day
yet
we
warned
you
i
and
my
pretty
sisters
you
must
not
reveal
our
secrets
for
if
you
betrayed
us
we
told
you
we
should
kill
you
and
sorry
i
should
be
for
indeed
i
love
you
tenderly
she
clipped
him
in
her
arms
called
him
her
heavenly
adonis
her
darling
her
little
white
ass
and
lavished
a
thousand
ardent
caresses
on
him
anon
when
he
repulsed
her
with
a
spasm
of
disgust
child
child
she
said
to
him
you
scorn
me
because
my
eyes
are
rimmed
with
red
my
nostrils
rotted
with
the
acrid
fetid
humour
they
distil
and
my
gums
adorned
with
a
single
tooth
and
that
black
and
extravagantly
long
such
is
your
neæra
it
is
too
true
but
if
you
love
me
i
shall
once
more
become
by
you
and
for
you
what
i
was
in
the
golden
days
of
saturn
when
my
youth
was
in
blossom
amid
the
blossoms
of
the
young
world
is
love
oh
my
young
god
that
makes
the
beauty
of
things
to
restore
my
beauty
all
that
is
needed
is
a
little
courage
up
mino
be
bold
and
show
your
mettle
at
these
words
which
were
accompanied
by
appropriate
gestures
fra
mino
shuddering
with
fear
and
horror
felt
himself
swoon
away
and
slipped
from
his
bed
on
to
the
pavement
of
his
cell
as
he
fell
he
seemed
to
catch
a
glimpse
between
his
lids
of
a
nymph
of
perfect
shape
and
peerless
beauty
whose
naked
body
rolled
over
his
like
waves
of
milk
he
woke
in
broad
daylight
bruised
and
broken
by
his
fall
the
leaves
of
the
manuscript
he
had
written
the
night
before
still
littered
the
desk
he
read
them
through
again
folded
and
sealed
them
with
his
seal
put
the
roll
inside
his
gown
and
unheeding
the
menaces
the
witches
had
twice
over
given
him
started
to
carry
his
revelations
to
the
lord
bishop
whose
palace
lifted
its
battlements
above
the
roofs
in
the
middle
of
the
city
he
found
him
donning
his
spurs
in
the
great
hall
surrounded
by
his
for
the
bishop
was
just
then
at
war
with
the
ghibellines
of
florence
he
asked
the
monk
to
what
he
owed
his
visit
and
on
being
informed
of
the
matter
invited
him
there
and
then
to
read
out
his
report
fra
mino
obeyed
and
the
bishop
heard
out
his
tale
to
the
end
he
had
no
special
lights
on
the
subject
of
apparitions
but
he
was
animated
with
an
ardent
zeal
for
the
interests
of
the
faith
without
a
day
delay
and
not
suffering
the
cares
of
the
war
to
distract
him
from
his
purpose
he
appointed
twelve
famous
doctors
in
theology
and
canon
law
to
examine
into
the
affair
urging
them
to
give
a
definite
and
speedy
decision
after
mature
inquiry
and
not
without
again
and
again
fra
mino
the
doctors
determined
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
open
the
tomb
of
san
satiro
in
the
chapel
of
san
michele
and
go
through
a
course
of
special
exorcisms
on
the
spot
as
to
the
points
of
doctrine
raised
by
fra
mino
they
declined
to
pronounce
a
formal
opinion
inclining
however
to
regard
as
rash
frivolous
and
the
arguments
advanced
by
the
franciscan
agreeably
to
the
advice
of
the
learned
doctors
and
by
order
of
the
bishop
the
tomb
of
san
satiro
was
opened
it
was
found
to
contain
nothing
but
a
handful
of
ashes
which
the
priests
sprinkled
with
holy
water
at
this
there
rose
a
white
vapour
from
which
issued
a
sound
of
faint
and
feeble
groans
the
night
following
this
pious
ceremony
fra
mino
dreamed
that
the
witches
bending
over
his
bed
were
tearing
his
heart
out
of
his
bosom
he
rose
at
dawn
tortured
with
sharp
pains
and
devoured
by
a
raging
thirst
he
dragged
himself
as
far
as
the
cloister
well
where
the
doves
used
to
drink
but
no
sooner
had
he
drained
down
a
few
drops
of
water
that
filled
a
hollow
in
the
than
he
felt
his
heart
swell
within
him
like
a
sponge
and
with
a
stifled
cry
to
god
he
choked
and
died

was
in
the
twentieth
year
of
his
age
the
most
agreeable
and
the
man
of
all
the
florentine
nobles
beneath
his
long
dark
locks
which
escaping
from
under
his
cap
fell
in
jetty
curls
over
his
white
brow
his
eyes
that
had
a
golden
gleam
in
them
shone
out
with
a
dazzling
brilliance
he
possessed
the
arms
of
hercules
and
the
hands
of
a
nymph
his
shoulders
were
broad
and
his
figure
slim
and
supple
he
was
well
skilled
in
breaking
difficult
horses
and
wielding
heavy
weapons
and
a
peerless
rider
at
the
ring
whenever
he
passed
along

at

that
madonna
gemma
wife
of
sandro
bujamonte
one
day
sent
her
nurse
to
let
him
know
how
she
loved
him
with
all
her
soul
and
was
like
to
die
of
longing
nor
less
ardently
was
he
invited
to
join
the
companies
the
young
florentine
lords
were
used
in
those
days
to
form
among
themselves
feasting
supping
gaming
and
hunting
together
and
sometimes
so
dearly
loving
each
other
that
one
and
all
would
wear
garments
of
a
like
cut
and
colour
but
with
equal
disdain
he
shunned
the
society
of
florentine
ladies
and
the
assemblages
of
her
young
nobles
for
so
proud
and
fierce
was
his
humour
he
took
no
pleasure
but
in
solitude
he
would
often
stay
all
the
day
shut
up
in
his
chamber
then
forth
to
wander
solitary
beneath
the
that
bordered
the
ema
road
at
the
hour
when
the
first
stars
are
in
the
pale
evening
sky
if
by
chance
he
encountered
riders
of
his
own
age
he
never
laughed
and
said
little
and
that
little
was
not
always
comprehensible
his
strange
bearing
and
ambiguous
words
were
a
grief
and
a
grievance
to
his
comrades
and
above
all
to
messer
betto
brunelleschi
for
he
dearly
loved
messer
guido
and
had
no
fonder
wish
than
to
make
him
one
of
the
brotherhood
which
embraced
the
richest
and
the
handsomest
young
noblemen
of
florence
and
of
which
he
was
himself
the
glory
and
the
delight
for
indeed
messer
betto
brunelleschi
was
reputed
the
fine
flower
of
chivalry
and
the
most
perfect
knight
of
all
tuscany
after
messer
guido
one
day
as
the
latter
was
just
entering
the
porch
of
santa
maria
novella
where
the
monks
of
the
order
of
saint
dominic
kept
at
that
time
a
number
of
books
that
had
been
brought
to
italy
by
the
greeks
messer
betto
who
was
crossing
the
piazza
at
the
moment
loudly
hailed
his
friend
hola

mine
he
shouted
whither
away
now
this
bright
day
that
invites
you
methinks
to
go
fowling
in
the
hills
rather
than
hide
in
the
gloom
of
the
cloister
yonder
do
me
a
favour
and
come
to
my
house
at
arezzo
where
i
will
play
the
flute
to
you
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
smile
grammercy
replied
messer
guido
without
so
much
as
deigning
to
turn
his
head
i
am
away
to
see
my
lady
and
so
saying
he
entered
the
church
which
he
crossed
with
a
rapid
step
recking
as
little
of
the
blessed
sacrament
exposed
on
the
altar
as
of
messer
betto
sitting
stiff
on
his
horse
outside
the
door
astounded
at
the
words
he
had
just
heard
guido
pushed
open
a
low
portal
leading
to
the
cloisters
followed
the
cloister
wall
and
arrived
in
the
library
where
fra
sisto
was
painting
the
figures
of
angels
there
after
saluting
the
good
brother
he
drew
out
from
a
great
painted
chest
one
of
the
books
newly
come
from
constantinople
laid
it
on
a
desk
and
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
it
was
a
treatise
on
love
writ
in
greek
by
the
divine
plato
messer
guido
sighed
his
hands
began
to
tremble
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
alas
he
muttered
hid
beneath
these
signs
is
the
light
and
i
can
not
see
it
he
said
thus
to
himself
because
the
knowledge
of
the
greek
tongue
was
then
altogether
lost
in
the
west
after
many
a
groan
he
took
the
book
and
kissing
it
laid
it
in
the
iron
chest
like
a
beautiful
dead
woman
in
her
coffin
then
he
asked
the
good
fra
sisto
to
give
him
the
manuscript
of
the
speeches
of
cicero
which
he
read
till
the
shades
of
evening
glooming
down
on
the
cypresses
in
the
cloister
garden
spread
their
batlike
wings
over
the
pages
of
his
book
for
you
must
know
messer
guido
cavalcanti
was
a
searcher
after
truth
in
the
writings
of
the
ancients
and
was
for
treading
the
arduous
ways
that
lead
mankind
to
immortality
devoured
by
the
noble
longing
of
discovery
he
would
set
out
in
canzones
the
doctrines
of
the
sages
concerning
love
which
is
the
path
to
virtue
a
few
days
later
messer
betto
brunelleschi
came
to
visit
him
at
his
own
house
on
the
promenade
of
the
adimari
at
the
peep
of
day
the
hour
when
the
lark
sings
in
the
corn
he
found
him
still
abed
and
after
kissing
him
said
tenderly
my
guido
my
guido
lad
put
me
out
of
my
pain
last
week
you
told
me
you
were
on
your
way
to
visit
your
lady
in
the
church
and
cloister
of
santa
maria
novella
ever
since
i
have
been
turning
turning
your
words
in
my
head
without
fathoming
their
meaning
i
shall
have
no
peace
till
you
have
given
me
an
explanation
of
them
i
beseech
you
tell
me
what
you
meant
so
far
that
is
as
your
discretion
shall
suffer
you
seeing
the
matter
doth
concern
a
lady
messer
guido
burst
out
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
in
bed
he
looked
messer
betto
in
the
eyes
friend
said
he
the
lady
i
spoke
to
you
of
hath
more
than
one
habitation
the
day
you
saw
me
going
to
visit
her
i
found
her
in
the
library
of
santa
maria
novella
but
alack
i
heard
but
the
one
half
of
her
discourse
for
she
spoke
to
me
in
both
of
the
two
languages
that
flow
like
honey
from
her
adorable
lips
first
she
delivered
me
a
discourse
in
the
tongue
of
the
greeks
which
i
could
not
comprehend
then
she
addressed
me
in
the
dialect
of
the
latins
with
a
wondrous
wisdom
and
so
well
pleased
was
i
with
her
conversation
that
i
am
right
fain
to
marry
her
tis
at
the
least
said
messer
betto
a
niece
of
the
emperor
of
constantinople
or
his
natural
daughter
how
name
you
her
if
needs
be
answered
messer
guido
we
must
give
her
a
love
name
such
as
every
poet
gives
to
his
mistress
i
will
call
her
diotima
in
memory
of
diotima
of
megara
who
showed
the
way
to
the
lovers
of
virtue
but
her
public
and
avowed
name
is
philosophy
and
is
the
most
excellent
bride
a
man
can
find
i
want
no
other
and
i
swear
by
the
gods
to
be
faithful
unto
death
which
doth
put
an
end
to
life
and
thought
when
he
heard
these
sentiments
messer
betto
struck
his
forehead
with
his
hand
and
cried
per
bacco
but
i
never
guessed
the
riddle
friend
guido
you
have
the
subtlest
wit
under
the
red
lily
of
florence
i
heartily
commend
your
taking
to
wife
so
high
a
dame
of
a
surety
will
spring
of
this
union
a
numerous
progeny
of
canzones
sonnets
and
ballades
i
promise
to
baptize
you
these
pretty
babes
to
the
sound
of
my
flute
with
dainty
mottoes
galore
and
gallant
devices
i
am
the
more
rejoiced
at
this
spiritual
wedlock
seeing
it
will
never
hinder
you
when
the
time
comes
to
marry
according
to
the
flesh
some
fair
and
goodly
lady
of
the
city
nay
you
are
out
returned
messer
guido
they
that
celebrate
the
espousals
of
the
mind
should
leave
carnal
marriage
to
the
profane
vulgar
which
includes
the
great
lords
the
merchants
and
the
handicraftsmen
if
like
me
you
had
known
my
diotima
you
would
have
learned
friend
betto
that
she
doth
distinguish
two
sorts
of
men
on
the
one
hand
such
as
being
fruitful
only
by
the
body
strive
but
for
that
coarse
and
commonplace
immortality
that
is
won
by
the
generation
of
children
on
the
other
they
whose
soul
conceives
and
engenders
what
is
meet
for
the
soul
to
produce
to
wit
the
good
and
beautiful
my
diotima
hath
willed
i
should
be
of
the
second
sort
and
i
will
not
go
against
her
good
pleasure
and
copy
the
mere
brutes
that
breed
and
procreate
messer
betto
brunelleschi
by
no
means
approved
of
this
resolution
he
pointed
out
to
his
friend
that
in
life
we
must
adapt
ourselves
to
the
different
conditions
and
modes
of
existence
suitable
to
the
different
ages
that
after
the
epoch
of
pleasures
comes
that
of
ambition
and
that
it
was
good
and
prudent
as
youth
waned
to
contract
alliance
with
some
rich
and
noble
family
affording
access
to
the
great
offices
of
the
republic
such
as
prior
of
the
arts
and
liberty
captain
of
the
people
or
gonfalonier
of
justice
seeing
however
that
his
friend
only
received
his
advice
with
a
lip
of
disgust
as
if
it
were
some
bitter
drug
he
said
no
more
on
the
point
for
fear
of
angering
him
deeming
it
wise
to
trust
to
time
which
will
change
men
hearts
and
reverse
the
strongest
resolutions
sweet
guido
he
interposed
gaily
tell
me
this
much
at
any
rate
doth
your
lady
suffer
you
to
have
delight
with
pretty
maids
and
to
take
part
in
our
diversions
for
that
matter
replied
messer
guido
she
hath
no
more
care
of
such
things
than
of
the
encounters
that
small
dog
you
see
asleep
yonder
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
may
make
in
the
street
and
in
very
deed
they
are
of
no
account
provided
a
man
doth
himself
attach
no
value
to
them
messer
betto
left
the
room
a
trifle
piqued
at
his
friend
scornful
bearing
he
continued
to
feel
the
liveliest
affection
for
his
friend
but
thought
it
unbecoming
to
press
him
overmuch
to
attend
the
fêtes
and
entertainments
he
gave
all
the
winter
long
with
an
admirable
liberality
at
the
same
time
the
gentlemen
of
his
company
resented
hotly
the
slight
the
son
of
the
signor
cavalcante
de
cavalcanti
did
them
by
refusing
to
share
their
society
they
began
to
rally
him
on
his
studies
and
poring
over
books
declaring
that
by
dint
of
so
feeding
on
parchment
like
the
monks
and
the
rats
he
would
end
up
by
growing
to
resemble
these
and
would
anon
have
nothing
to
show
but
a
pointed
snout
and
three
long
hairs
for
beard
peeping
out
from
under
a
black
hood
and
that
madonna
gemma
herself
would
cry
out
at
sight
of
him
venus
my
patroness
what
a
pass
have
his
books
brought
my
handsome
george
to
he
is
good
for
naught
now
but
to
throw
away
his
lance
and
hold
a
in
hand
instead
so
they
miscalled
him
sore
saying
he
toyed
only
with
the
bookworms
and
spiders
and
was
tied
to
the
of
mistress
philosophia
nor
did
they
stop
short
at
light
raillery
but
let
it
be
understood
he
was
too
learned
by
far
to
be
a
good
christian
that
he
was
given
over
to
magic
arts
and
held
converse
with
the
devils
of
hell
folk
do
not
lurk
in
hiding
like
that
they
said
to
each
other
for
any
reason
but
to
foregather
with
the
devils
male
and
female
and
get
gold
of
them
as
the
price
of
revolting
and
shameful
acts
to
crown
all
they
charged
him
with
sharing
those
false
and
pernicious
doctrines
of
epicurus
which
had
already
seduced
an
emperor
at
naples
and
a
pope
in
rome
and
threatened
to
turn
the
peoples
of
europe
into
a
herd
of
swine
without
a
thought
of
god
and
their
own
immortal
souls
a
mighty
fine
gain
they
ended
up
when
his
studies
have
brought
him
to
forswear
the
holy
trinity
this
last
charge
they
bruited
abroad
was
the
most
formidable
of
all
and
might
easily
work
ruin
on
messer
guido
now
messer
guido
cavalcanti
was
well
aware
of
the
mockery
they
made
of
him
in
the
companies
by
reason
of
the
careful
heed
he
had
of
eternal
things
and
this
was
why
he
shunned
the
society
of
living
men
and
sought
rather
to
the
dead
in
those
days
the
church
of
san
giovanni
was
surrounded
with
roman
tombs
thither
would
messer
guido
often
come
at
and
meditate
far
into
the
silent
night
he
believed
as
the
chronicles
reported
that
this
fair
church
of
san
giovanni
had
been
a
pagan
temple
before
it
was
a
christian
church
and
the
thought
pleased
his
soul
which
was
enamoured
of
the
mysteries
especially
he
loved
to
look
on
these
tombs
where
the
sign
of
the
cross
found
no
place
but
which
bore
latin
inscriptions
and
were
adorned
with
carven
figures
of
men
and
gods
they
were
long
cubes
of
white
marble
on
the
sides
of
which
could
be
made
out
representations
of
banquets
and
hunting
parties
the
death
of
adonis
the
fight
of
lapithæ
and
centaurs
the
refusal
of
the
chaste
hippolytus
the
amazons
messer
guido
would
read
the
lettering
with
anxious
care
and
try
hard
to
penetrate
the
meaning
of
these
fables
one
tomb
in
particular
occupied
him
more
than
all
the
rest
for
it
showed
him
two
loves
each
holding
a
torch
and
he
was
curious
to
discover
the
nature
of
these
two
loves
well
one
night
that
he
was
pondering
on
these
things
more
deeply
than
ever
a
shadow
rose
up
above
the
lid
of
the
tomb
a
luminous
shadow
as
when
you
see
or
fancy
you
see
the
moon
shining
faintly
through
a
cloud
gradually
it
took
the
shape
of
a
beautiful
virgin
and
said
thus
in
a
voice
softer
than
the
reeds
waving
in
the
wind
i
am
she
that
sleeps
within
this
tomb
and
i
am
called
julia
læta
i
lost
the
light
on
my
at
the
age
of
sixteen
years
three
months
and
nine
days
since
then
whether
i
am
or
am
not
i
can
not
tell
never
question
the
dead
stranger
for
they
see
naught
and
a
thick
night
environs
them
is
said
that
such
as
in
life
knew
the
cruel
joys
of
venus
roam
the
glades
of
a
dense
forest
of
myrtles
for
me
who
died
a
virgin
i
sleep
a
dreamless
sleep
they
have
graven
two
loves
on
the
stone
of
my
sepulchre
one
gives
mortals
the
light
of
day
the
other
quenches
it
in
their
tender
eyes
for
ever
the
countenance
of
both
is
the
same
a
smiling
countenance
for
birth
and
death
are
two
twin
brothers
and
all
is
joy
to
the
immortal
gods
i
have
spoken
the
voice
fell
silent
like
the
rustling
of
leaves
when
the
wind
drops
the
transparent
shadow
vanished
away
in
the
light
of
dawn
which
descended
clear
and
white
on
the
hills
and
the
tombs
of
san
giovanni
grew
wan
and
silent
once
again
in
the
morning
air
and
messer
guido
pondered
the
truth
i
foresaw
hath
been
made
manifest
to
me
is
it
not
writ
in
the
book
the
priests
use
the
dead
praise
thee
o
lord
the
dead
are
without
thought
or
knowledge
and
the
divine
epicurus
was
well
advised
when
he
enfranchised
the
living
from
the
vain
terrors
of
the
life
to
come
a
troop
of
horsemen
pricking
across
the
piazza
abruptly
broke
up
his
meditations
it
was
messer
betto
and
his
company
away
to
hunt
the
cranes
along
the
brookside
of
peretola
so
ho
cried
one
of
them
whose
name
was
bocca
see
yonder
messer
guido
the
philosopher
who
scorns
us
for
our
good
life
and
gentle
ways
and
merry
doings
he
seems
half
frozen
and
well
he
may
be
put
in
messer
doria
who
was
reputed
a
wag
his
lady
the
moon
whom
he
kisses
tenderly
all
night
hath
hied
her
behind
the
hills
to
sleep
with
some
shepherd
swain
he
is
eat
up
with
jealousy
look
you
how
green
he
is
they
spurred
their
horses
among
the
tombs
and
drew
up
in
a
ring
about
messer
guido
nay
nay
messer
doria
returned
bocca
the
lady
moon
is
too
round
and
bright
for
so
black
a
gallant
if
you
would
know
his
mistresses
they
be
here
here
he
comes
to
find
them
in
their
bed
where
he
is
less
like
to
be
stung
of
fleas
than
of
scorpions
fie
out
upon
the
vile
necromancer
exclaimed
messer
giordano
crossing
himself
see
what
learning
leads
to
folk
disown
god
and
go
fornicating
in
pagan
graveyards
leaning
against
the
church
wall
messer
guido
let
the
riders
have
their
say
when
he
judged
they
had
voided
all
the
froth
of
their
shallow
brains
over
him
gentle
cavaliers
he
answered
smiling
you
are
at
home
i
am
your
host
and
courtesy
constrains
me
to
receive
your
insults
without
reply
so
saying
he
bounded
over
the
tombs
and
walked
quietly
away
the
horsemen
looked
at
one
another
in
amazement
then
bursting
out
laughing
they
gave
spur
to
their
steeds
as
they
were
galloping
along
the
peretola
road
messer
bocca
said
to
messer
betto
who
can
doubt
now
but
this
guido
is
gone
mad
he
told
us
we
were
at
home
in
the
graveyard
and
to
say
such
a
thing
he
must
needs
have
lost
his
wits
true
it
is
replied
messer
betto
i
can
not
imagine
what
he
meant
to
have
us
understand
by
talking
in
such
a
sort
but
he
is
used
to
expressing
himself
in
dark
sayings
and
subtle
parables
he
hath
tossed
us
a
bone
this
time
must
be
opened
to
find
the
marrow
pardi
ejaculated
messer
giordano
my
dog
may
have
this
bone
to
gnaw
and
the
pagan
that
threw
it
to
boot
they
soon
reached
the
banks
of
the
peretola
brook
whence
the
cranes
may
be
seen
rising
in
flocks
at
daybreak
during
the
chase
which
was
abundantly
successful
messer
betto
brunelleschi
never
ceased
pondering
the
words
guido
had
used
and
by
dint
of
much
thinking
he
discovered
their
signification
hailing
messer
bocca
with
loud
cries
he
said
to
him
come
hither
messer
bocca
i
have
just
guessed
what
it
was
messer
guido
meant
us
to
understand
he
told
us
we
were
at
home
in
a
graveyard
because
the
ignorant
be
for
all
the
world
like
dead
men
who
according
to
the
epicurean
doctrine
have
no
faculty
of
thought
or
knowledge
messer
bocca
replied
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
understood
better
than
most
how
to
fly
a
flanders
hawk
to
make
with
his
enemies
and
to
upset
a
girl
and
this
was
knowledge
sufficient
for
his
state
in
life
messer
guido
continued
for
several
years
more
to
study
the
science
of
love
he
embodied
his
reflexions
in
canzones
which
it
is
not
given
to
all
men
to
interpret
composing
a
book
of
these
verses
that
was
borne
in
triumph
through
the
streets
garlanded
with
laurel
then
seeing
the
purest
souls
are
not
without
alloy
of
terrestrial
passions
and
life
bears
us
one
and
all
along
in
its
sinuous
and
stormy
course
it
fell
out
that
at
the
of
youth
and
age
messer
guido
was
seduced
by
the
ambitions
of
the
flesh
and
the
powers
of
this
world
he
wedded
to
further
his
projects
of
aggrandizement
the
daughter
of
the
lord
farinata
degli
uberti
the
same
who
one
time
reddened
the
arbia
with
the
blood
of
the
florentines
he
threw
himself
into
the
quarrels
of
the
citizens
with
all
the
pride
and
impetuosity
of
his
nature
and
he
took
for
mistresses
the
lady
mandetta
and
the
lady
giovanna
who
represented
the
one
the
albigensians
the
other
the
ghibellines
it
was
the
time
when
messer
dante
alighieri
was
prior
of
the
arts
and
liberty
the
city
was
divided
into
two
hostile
camps
those
of
the
bianchi
and
the
neri
one
day
when
the
principal
citizens
were
assembled
in
the
piazza
of
the
frescobaldi
the
bianchi
on
one
side
the
square
and
the
neri
on
the
other
to
assist
at
the
obsequies
of
a
noble
lady
of
florence
the
doctors
and
the
knights
were
seated
as
the
custom
was
on
raised
benches
while
in
front
of
them
the
younger
men
sat
on
the
ground
on
rush
mats
one
of
the
latter
standing
up
to
settle
his
cloak
those
who
were
opposite
thought
he
was
for
defying
them
they
started
to
their
feet
in
turn
and
bared
their
swords
instantly
every
one
unsheathed
and
the
kinsmen
of
the
dead
lady
had
all
the
difficulty
in
the
world
to
separate
the
combatants
from
that
day
florence
ceased
to
be
a
town
gladdened
by
the
work
of
its
handicraftsmen
and
became
a
forest
full
of
wolves
ravening
for
each
other
blood
messer
guido
shared
these
savage
passions
and
grew
gloomy
restless
and
sullen
never
a
day
passed
but
he
exchanged
with
the
neri
in
the
streets
of
florence
where
in
old
days
he
had
meditated
on
the
nature
and
constitution
of
the
soul
more
than
once
he
had
felt
the
assassin
dagger
on
his
flesh
before
he
was
banished
with
the
rest
of
his
faction
and
confined
in
the
town
of
sarzana
for
six
months
he
languished
there
sick
with
fever
and
hate
and
when
eventually
the
bianchi
were
recalled
he
came
back
to
his
native
city
a
dying
man
in
the
year
on
the
third
day
after
the
assumption
of
the
blessed
virgin
mary
he
found
strength
enough
to
drag
himself
as
far
as
his
own
fair
church
of
san
giovanni
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
grief
he
lay
down
on
the
tomb
of
julia
læta
who
in
the
old
days
had
revealed
to
him
the
mysteries
the
profane
know
nothing
of
it
was
the
hour
when
the
church
bells
ring
out
through
the
quivering
air
of
evening
a
farewell
to
the
setting
sun
messer
betto
brunelleschi
who
was
crossing
the
piazza
on
his
way
home
from
his
country
house
saw
amid
the
tombs
two
haggard
falcon
eyes
burning
in
a
fleshless
face
and
recognizing
the
friend
of
his
youth
was
seized
with
wonder
and
pity
he
approached
him
and
kissing
him
as
he
used
in
former
days
said
with
a
sigh
ah
guido
mine
what
fire
is
it
hath
consumed
you
away
thus
you
burned
up
your
life
in
science
first
and
then
in
public
affairs
i
beseech
you
quench
somewhat
the
ardour
of
your
spirit
comrade
let
us
husband
our
strength
and
as
riccardo
the
blacksmith
says
make
up
a
fire
to
last
but
guido
cavalcanti
put
his
hand
on
his
lips
hush
he
whispered
hush
not
a
word
more
friend
betto
i
wait
my
lady
her
who
shall
console
me
for
so
many
vain
loves
that
in
this
world
have
betrayed
me
and
that
i
have
betrayed
it
is
equally
cruel
and
useless
to
think
and
to
act
this
i
know
the
curse
is
not
so
much
to
live
for
i
see
you
are
well
and
hearty
friend
betto
and
many
another
man
is
the
same
the
curse
is
not
to
live
but
to
know
we
live
the
curse
is
to
be
conscious
and
to
will
happily
there
is
a
remedy
for
these
evils
let
us
say
no
more
i
await
the
lady
whom
i
have
never
wronged
for
never
have
i
doubted
but
she
was
gentle
and
and
i
have
learned
by
much
pondering
how
peaceful
and
secure
it
is
to
slumber
on
her
bosom
many
fables
have
been
told
of
her
bed
and
but
i
have
not
believed
the
lies
of
the
ignorant
crowd
so
it
is
she
cometh
to
me
as
a
mistress
to
her
lover
her
brow
garlanded
with
flowers
and
her
lips
smiling
he
broke
off
with
these
words
and
fell
dead
over
the
ancient
tomb
his
body
was
buried
without
any
great
pomp

cloister

and
so
successful
was
spinello
with
his
horrible
and
portentous
production
that
it
was
commonly
reported
so
great
is
alway
the
force
of
fancy
that
the
said
figure
of

trodden
underfoot
by
michael
in
the
of
the
church
of

at

painted
by

to
the

had
a
wholesome
terror
of

in
the

it
is
given
to
the
powers
of
darkness
to
prevail
and
the
worthy

fears
were
not

for
in
those
days
the

had
good
cause

the

robbed
them
of
more
souls
with

the

instil
a
horror

describe
to
the

that
day
of

that
day

which
is

to

david

last
trump
but
there
it
was
all
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
whereas
a
painting
displayed
on
a
chapel
wall
or
in
the
cloister
showing
jesus
christ
sitting
on
the
great
white
throne
to
judge
the
living
and
the
dead
spoke
unceasingly
to
the
eyes
of
sinners
and
through
the
eyes
chastened
such
as
had
sinned
by
the
eyes
or
otherwise
it
was
in
the
days
when
cunning
masters
were
depicting
at
in
florence
and
the
campo
santo
of
pisa
the
mysteries
of
divine
justice
these
works
were
drawn
according
to
the
account
in
verse
which
dante
alighieri
a
man
very
learned
in
theology
and
in
canon
law
wrote
in
days
gone
by
of
his
journey
to
hell
and
purgatory
and
paradise
whither
by
the
singular
great
merits
of
his
lady
he
was
able
to
make
his
way
alive
so
everything
in
these
paintings
was
instructive
and
true
and
we
may
say
surely
less
profit
is
to
be
had
of
reading
the
most
full
and
ample
chronicle
than
from
contemplating
such
representative
works
of
art
moreover
the
florentine
masters
took
heed
to
paint
under
the
shade
of
orange
groves
on
the
turf
fair
ladies
and
gallant
knights
with
death
lying
in
wait
for
them
with
his
scythe
while
they
were
discoursing
of
love
to
the
sound
of
lutes
and
viols
nothing
was
better
fitted
to
convert
sinners
who
quaff
forgetfulness
of
god
on
the
lips
of
women
to
rebuke
the
covetous
the
painter
would
show
to
the
life
the
devils
pouring
molten
gold
down
the
throat
of
bishop
or
abbess
who
had
commissioned
some
work
from
him
and
then
scamped
his
pay
this
is
why
the
demons
in
those
days
were
bitter
enemies
of
the
painters
and
above
all
of
the
florentine
painters
who
surpassed
all
the
rest
in
subtlety
of
wit
chiefly
they
reproached
them
with
representing
them
under
a
hideous
guise
with
the
heads
of
bird
and
fish
serpents
bodies
and
bats
wings
this
sore
resentment
which
they
felt
will
come
out
plainly
in
the
history
of
spinello
of
arezzo
spinello
spinelli
was
sprung
of
a
noble
family
of
florentine
exiles
and
his
graciousness
of
mind
matched
his
gentle
birth
for
he
was
the
most
skilful
painter
of
his
time
he
wrought
many
and
great
works
at
florence
and
the
pisans
begged
him
to
complete
giotto
in
their
campo
santo
where
the
dead
rest
beneath
roses
in
holy
earth
shipped
from
jerusalem
at
last
after
working
long
years
in
divers
cities
and
getting
much
gold
he
longed
to
see
once
more
the
good
city
of
arezzo
his
mother
the
men
of
arezzo
had
not
forgotten
how
spinello
in
his
younger
days
being
enrolled
in
the
confraternity
of
santa
maria
della
misericordia
had
visited
the
sick
and
buried
the
dead
in
the
plague
of
they
were
grateful
to
him
beside
for
having
by
his
works
spread
the
fame
of
their
city
over
all
tuscany
for
all
these
reasons
they
welcomed
him
with
high
honours
on
his
return
still
full
of
vigour
in
his
old
age
he
undertook
important
tasks
in
his
native
town
his
wife
would
tell
him
you
are
rich
spinello
do
you
rest
and
leave
younger
men
to
paint
instead
of
you
it
is
meet
a
man
should
end
his
days
in
a
gentle
religious
quiet
it
is
tempting
god
to
be
for
ever
raising
new
and
worldly
monuments
mere
heathen
towers
of
babel
quit
your
colours
and
your
varnishes
spinello
or
they
will
destroy
your
peace
of
mind
so
the
good
dame
would
preach
but
he
refused
to
listen
for
his
one
thought
was
to
increase
his
fortune
and
renown
far
from
resting
on
his
laurels
he
arranged
a
price
with
the
wardens
of
sant
agnolo
for
a
history
of
michael
that
was
to
cover
all
the
choir
of
the
church
and
contain
an
infinity
of
figures
into
this
enterprise
he
threw
himself
with
extraordinary
ardour
rereading
the
parts
of
scripture
that
were
to
be
his
inspiration
he
set
himself
to
study
deeply
every
line
and
every
word
of
these
passages
not
content
with
drawing
all
day
long
in
his
workshop
he
persisted
in
working
both
at
bed
and
board
while
at
dusk
walking
below
the
hill
on
whose
brow
arezzo
proudly
lifts
her
walls
and
towers
he
was
still
lost
in
thought
and
we
may
say
the
story
of
the
archangel
was
already
limned
in
his
brain
when
he
started
to
sketch
out
the
incidents
in
red
chalk
on
the
plaster
of
the
wall
he
was
soon
done
tracing
these
outlines
then
he
fell
to
painting
above
the
high
altar
the
scene
that
was
to
outshine
all
the
others
in
brilliancy
for
it
was
his
intent
therein
to
glorify
the
leader
of
the
hosts
of
heaven
for
the
victory
he
won
before
the
beginning
of
time
accordingly
spinello
represented
michael
fighting
in
the
air
against
the
serpent
with
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
he
figured
with
delight
in
the
bottom
part
of
the
picture
the
prince
of
the
devils
lucifer
under
the
semblance
of
an
appalling
monster
the
figures
seemed
to
grow
to
life
of
themselves
under
his
hand
his
success
was
beyond
his
fondest
hopes
so
hideous
was
the
countenance
of
lucifer
none
could
escape
the
nightmare
of
its
foulness
the
face
haunted
the
painter
in
the
streets
and
even
went
home
with
him
to
his
lodging
presently
when
night
was
come
spinello
in
his
bed
beside
his
wife
and
fell
asleep
in
his
slumbers
he
saw
an
angel
as
comely
as
michael
but
black
and
the
angel
said
to
him
spinello
i
am
lucifer
tell
me
where
had
you
seen
me
that
you
should
paint
me
as
you
have
under
so
ignominious
a
likeness
the
old
painter
answered
trembling
that
he
had
never
seen
him
with
his
eyes
never
having
gone
down
alive
into
hell
like
messer
dante
alighieri
but
that
in
depicting
him
as
he
had
done
he
was
for
expressing
in
visible
lines
and
colours
the
hideousness
of
sin
lucifer
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
the
hill
of
san
gemignano
seemed
of
a
sudden
to
heave
and
stagger
spinello
he
went
on
will
you
do
me
the
pleasure
to
reason
awhile
with
me
i
am
no
mean
logician
he
you
pray
to
knows
that
receiving
no
reply
lucifer
proceeded
in
these
terms
spinello
you
have
read
the
books
that
tell
of
me
you
know
of
my
enterprise
and
how
i
forsook
heaven
to
become
the
prince
of
this
world
a
tremendous
adventure
and
a
unique
one
had
not
the
giants
in
like
fashion
assailed
the
god
jupiter
as
yourself
have
seen
spinello
recorded
on
an
ancient
tomb
where
this
titanic
war
is
carved
in
marble
it
is
true
said
spinello
i
have
seen
the
tomb
shaped
like
a
great
tun
in
the
church
of
santa
reparata
at
florence
is
a
fine
work
of
the
romans
still
returned
lucifer
smiling
the
giants
are
not
pictured
on
it
in
the
shape
of
frogs
or
chameleons
or
the
like
hideous
and
horrid
creatures
true
replied
the
painter
but
then
they
had
not
attacked
the
true
god
but
only
a
false
idol
of
the
pagans
is
a
mighty
difference
the
fact
is
clear
lucifer
you
raised
the
standard
of
revolt
against
the
true
and
veritable
king
of
earth
and
heaven
i
will
not
deny
it
said
lucifer
and
how
many
sorts
of
sins
do
you
charge
me
with
for
that
seven
it
is
like
enough
the
painter
answered
and
deadly
sins
one
and
all
seven
exclaimed
the
angel
of
darkness
well
the
number
is
canonical
everything
goes
by
sevens
in
my
history
which
is
close
bound
up
with
god
spinello
you
deem
me
proud
angry
and
envious
i
enter
no
protest
provided
you
allow
that
glory
was
my
only
aim
do
you
deem
me
covetous
granted
again
covetousness
is
a
virtue
for
princes
for
gluttony
and
lust
if
you
hold
me
guilty
i
will
not
complain
remains
as
he
pronounced
the
word
lucifer
crossed
his
arms
across
his
breast
and
shaking
his
gloomy
head
tossed
his
flaming
locks
tell
me
spinello
do
you
really
think
i
am
indolent
do
you
take
me
for
a
coward
do
you
hold
that
in
my
revolt
i
showed
a
lack
of
courage
nay
you
can
not
then
it
was
but
just
to
paint
me
in
the
guise
of
a
hero
with
a
proud
countenance
you
should
wrong
no
one
not
even
the
devil
can
not
you
see
that
you
insult
him
you
make
prayer
to
when
you
give
him
for
adversary
a
vile
monstrous
toad
spinello
you
are
very
ignorant
for
a
man
of
your
age
i
have
a
great
mind
to
pull
your
ears
as
they
do
to
an
schoolboy
at
this
threat
and
seeing
the
arm
of
lucifer
already
stretched
out
towards
him
spinello
clapped
his
hand
to
his
head
and
began
to
howl
with
terror
his
good
wife
waking
up
with
a
start
asked
him
what
ailed
him
he
told
her
with
chattering
teeth
how
he
had
just
seen
lucifer
and
had
been
in
terror
for
his
ears
i
told
you
so
retorted
the
worthy
dame
i
knew
all
those
figures
you
will
go
on
painting
on
the
walls
would
end
by
driving
you
mad
i
am
not
mad
protested
the
painter
i
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
and
he
is
beautiful
to
look
on
albeit
proud
and
sad
first
thing
i
will
blot
out
the
horrid
figure
i
have
drawn
and
set
in
its
place
the
shape
i
beheld
in
my
dream
for
we
must
not
wrong
even
the
devil
himself
you
had
best
go
to
sleep
again
scolded
his
wife
you
are
talking
stark
nonsense
and
unchristian
to
boot
spinello
tried
to
rise
but
his
strength
failed
him
and
he
fell
back
unconscious
on
his
pillow
he
lingered
on
a
few
days
in
a
high
fever
and
then
died

it
was
only
because
he
was
afraid
of
bad
debts
with
him
they
call
the
wily
one
and
who
is
full
of
cunning
and
trickery
nicolas
nerli
was
bold
and
unscrupulous
he
had
won
great
riches
and
robbed
many
folks
of
their
own
wherefore
he
was
highly
honoured
in
the
city
of
florence
he
dwelt
in
a
palace
where
the
light
of
god
day
entered
only
by
narrow
windows
and
this
was
a
wise
precaution
for
the
rich
man
house
must
be
a
castle
and
they
who
possess
much
wealth
do
well
to
defend
by
force
what
they
have
gotten
by
cunning
accordingly
the
windows
were
guarded
with
bars
and
the
doors
with
chains
outside
the
walls
were
painted
in
fresco
by
clever
craftsmen
who
had
depicted
thereon
the
virtues
under
the
likeness
of
women
the
patriarchs
the
prophets
and
the
kings
of
israel
tapestries
hung
in
the
rooms
within
displaying
the
histories
of
alexander
and
tristram
as
they
are
told
us
in
legends
nicolas
nerli
set
all
the
city
talking
of
his
wealth
by
the
pious
foundations
he
established
he
had
raised
an
hospital
beyond
the
walls
the
frieze
of
which
carved
and
painted
represented
the
most
honourable
actions
of
his
own
life
in
gratitude
for
the
sums
of
money
he
had
given
towards
the
completion
of
santa
maria
novella
his
portrait
was
suspended
in
the
choir
of
that
church
in
it
he
was
shown
kneeling
with
praying
hands
at
the
feet
of
the
blessed
virgin
easily
recognizable
by
his
cap
of
red
worsted
his
furred
hood
his
yellow
face
swimming
in
fatness
and
his
little
keen
eyes
his
good
wife
monna
bismantova
a
woman
with
a
mournful
air
and
seeming
as
though
no
man
could
ever
have
taken
aught
of
pleasure
with
her
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
virgin
in
the
humble
attitude
of
supplication
nicolas
nerli
was
one
of
the
chiefest
citizens
of
the
republic
seeing
he
had
never
spoken
against
the
laws
and
because
he
had
never
regarded
the
poor
nor
such
folk
as
the
great
and
powerful
condemn
to
fine
and
exile
nothing
had
lowered
in
the
estimation
of
the
magistrates
the
high
repute
he
had
won
in
their
eyes
by
reason
of
his
great
riches
returning
one
winter
evening
later
than
usual
to
his
palace
he
was
surrounded
on
the
threshold
by
a
band
of
mendicants
who
held
out
their
hands
and
asked
alms
he
repulsed
them
with
hard
words
but
hunger
making
them
as
fierce
and
bold
as
wolves
they
formed
a
circle
round
him
and
begged
him
for
bread
in
hoarse
lamentable
voices
he
was
just
stooping
to
pick
up
stones
to
throw
at
them
when
he
saw
one
of
his
coming
carrying
on
his
head
a
basketful
of
loaves
of
black
bread
intended
for
the
stablemen
kitchen
helpers
and
gardeners
he
signed
to
the
pantler
to
approach
and
diving
both
hands
into
the
basket
tossed
the
loaves
to
the
starving
wretches
then
entering
the
house
he
went
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
in
the
night
he
was
smitten
with
apoplexy
and
died
so
suddenly
he
believed
himself
still
in
his
bed
when
he
saw
in
a
place
as
dark
as
erebus
michael
the
archangel
shining
in
the
brightness
that
issued
from
his
own
presence
balance
in
hand
the
archangel
was
engaged
in
filling
the
scales
recognizing
in
the
scale
that
hung
lowest
certain
jewels
belonging
to
widow
women
that
he
had
in
pledge
a
great
heap
of
clippings
from
pieces
he
had
filched
dishonestly
and
sundry
very
fine
gold
coins
which
were
unique
and
which
he
had
acquired
by
usury
or
fraud
nicolas
nerli
comprehended
it
was
his
own
life
now
come
to
an
end
that
michael
was
at
that
instant
weighing
before
his
eyes
good
sir
he
said
good
michael
if
you
put
in
the
one
scale
all
the
lucre
i
have
gotten
in
my
life
set
in
the
other
if
it
please
you
the
noble
foundations
whereby
i
have
so
splendidly
shown
my
piety
forget
not
the
duomo
of
santa
maria
novella
to
which
i
contributed
a
good
third
nor
my
hospital
beyond
the
walls
that
i
built
entirely
out
of
my
own
pocket
never
fear
nicolas
nerli
answered
the
archangel
i
will
forget
nothing
and
with
his
own
heavenly
hands
he
set
in
the
lighter
scale
the
duomo
of
santa
maria
novella
and
the
hospital
with
its
frieze
all
carved
and
painted
but
the
scale
did
not
drop
an
inch
at
this
the
banker
was
sorely
disquieted
good
michael
think
again
you
have
not
put
this
side
of
the
balance
my
fine
stoup
i
gave
to
san
giovanni
nor
the
pulpit
in
sant
andrea
where
the
baptism
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
is
depicted
the
artist
charged
me
a
pretty
penny
for
it
the
archangel
put
both
pulpit
and
stoup
atop
of
the
hospital
in
the
scale
but
still
it
never
stirred
nicolas
nerli
began
to
feel
a
cold
sweat
bathing
his
brow
good
sir
dear
archangel
he
asked
are
you
quite
certain
your
balances
are
true
michael
replied
smiling
that
they
were
of
a
different
pattern
from
the
balances
the
brokers
of
paris
use
and
the
of
venice
and
were
precisely
accurate
what
sighed
nicolas
nerli
his
face
as
white
as
chalk
duomo
pulpit
basin
hospital
with
all
its
beds
do
they
weigh
no
more
than
a
bit
of
straw
a
pinch
of
down
from
a
bird
breast
see
for
yourself
nicolas
said
the
archangel
so
far
the
weight
of
your
iniquities
much
outweighs
the
light
load
of
your
good
works
then
i
must
go
to
hell
cried
the
florentine
and
his
teeth
chattered
with
horror
patience
nicolas
nerli
returned
the
weigher
of
souls
patience
we
are
not
done
yet
there
is
something
left
so
saying
the
blessed
michael
took
the
loaves
of
black
bread
the
rich
man
had
tossed
the
night
before
to
the
poor
beggars
he
laid
them
in
the
scale
containing
the
good
works
which
instantly
fell
while
the
other
rose
and
the
two
scales
remained
level
the
beam
dropped
neither
to
right
nor
left
and
the
needle
marked
the
exact
equality
of
the
two
loads
the
banker
could
not
believe
his
eyes
but
the
glorious
archangel
said
solemnly
see
nicolas
nerli
you
are
good
neither
for
heaven
nor
hell
begone
go
back
to
florence
multiply
through
the
city
the
loaves
you
gave
last
night
with
your
own
hand
in
the
dusk
when
no
man
saw
you
and
you
shall
be
saved
it
is
not
enough
that
heaven
open
its
doors
to
the
thief
that
repented
and
the
harlot
that
wept
the
mercy
of
god
is
infinite
and
able
to
save
even
a
rich
man
do
this
multiply
the
loaves
whose
weight
you
see
weighing
down
my
balances
begone
then
nicholas
nerli
awoke
in
his
bed
he
resolved
to
follow
faithfully
the
counsel
of
the
archangel
and
multiply
the
bread
of
the
poor
and
so
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
the
three
years
he
spent
on
earth
after
his
first
death
he
was
very
pitiful
to
the
unfortunate
and
a
great
giver
of
alms

the

in

buonamico
cristofani
florentine
surnamed
buffalmacco
by
reason
of
his
merry
humour
served
his
apprenticeship
in
the
workshop
of
andrea
tafi
painter
and
now
the
said
tafi
was
a
very
knowledgeable
master
sojourning
at
venice
in
the
days
when
apollonius
was
covering
the
walls
of
san
marco
with
mosaics
he
had
discovered
by
means
of
a
trick
certain
secrets
the
greek
craftsmen
were
for
keeping
sedulously
to
themselves
returning
to
his
native
city
he
won
so
high
a
repute
in
the
art
of
composing
pictures
by
arranging
together
a
countless
number
of
little
differently
coloured
cubes
of
glass
he
could
not
supply
all
the
demands
addressed
to
him
for
works
of
the
sort
and
all
day
and
every
day
from
matins
to
vespers
he
was
busy
mounted
on
a
scaffold
in
some
church
or
other
depicting
the
dead
christ
or
christ
in
his
glory
the
patriarchs
and
prophets
or
the
history
of
job
or
of
noah
and
as
he
was
likewise
keen
to
paint
in
fresco
with
pounded
colours
in
the
manner
of
the
greeks
which
was
then
the
only
one
known
he
refused
himself
all
rest
and
gave
his
apprentices
none
either
he
used
to
tell
them
they
who
like
myself
are
in
possession
of
noble
secrets
and
excel
in
their
art
should
keep
both
mind
and
hand
ceaselessly
active
to
carry
out
their
enterprises
so
as
to
win
much
wealth
and
leave
a
long
memory
behind
them
and
if
i
old
and
broken
down
as
i
am
spare
myself
no
trouble
you
are
bound
to
do
your
utmost
to
help
me
with
all
your
strength
which
is
fresh
hearty
and
undiminished
and
in
order
that
his
colours
his
tesseræ
of
molten
glass
and
his
impastos
might
be
all
ready
prepared
by
dawn
of
day
he
forced
the
lads
to
rise
in
the
middle
of
the
night
nothing
could
well
be
more
hateful
to
buffalmacco
who
was
in
the
habit
of
supping
plentifully
and
loved
to
run
the
streets
at
an
hour
when
as
they
say
all
cats
are
grey
he
went
to
bed
late
and
slept
sound
his
conscience
being
clear
enough
after
all
accordingly
when
tafi
shrill
voice
woke
him
up
out
of
his
beauty
sleep
he
would
only
turn
round
on
his
pillow
and
pretend
to
be
deaf
but
his
master
invariably
persisted
and
at
a
pinch
would
go
into
the
apprentice
room
and
very
soon
have
the
sheets
dragged
off
the
bed
and
a
jug
of
cold
water
emptied
over
the
sluggard
head
poor
buffalmacco
shivering
and
half
dressed
would
away
grumbling
to
grind
the
colours
in
the
dark
cold
workroom
cudgelling
his
wits
the
while
grinding
and
cursing
all
the
time
to
think
of
some
way
of
escaping
such
harsh
and
humiliating
treatment
in
future
long
he
sought
in
vain
but
his
mind
was
an
active
one
and
one
morning
early
a
happy
thought
struck
him
to
put
this
in
execution
buffalmacco
waited
till
his
master
was
out
of
the
way
directly
day
broke
andrea
tafi
as
his
habit
was
pocketed
the
flask
of
chianti
and
the
three
eggs
that
formed
his
regular
breakfast
and
bidding
his
pupils
melt
the
glass
tesseræ
according
to
the
directions
and
take
every
possible
pains
went
off
to
work
in
the
famous
church
of
san
giovanni
a
marvellously
beautiful
building
constructed
with
admirable
art
in
the
classical
manner
at
the
time
he
was
executing
on
its
walls
a
series
of
mosaics
representing
the
angels
archangels
cherubim
and
seraphim
powers
thrones
and
dominions
the
chief
acts
of
the
almighty
from
the
creation
of
light
to
the
deluge
the
history
of
joseph
and
his
brethren
the
history
of
jesus
christ
from
the
moment
he
was
conceived
in
his
mother
womb
till
his
ascension
into
heaven
and
the
life
of
john
baptist
seeing
the
infinite
pains
he
took
to
fix
the
pieces
truly
in
the
cement
and
arrange
them
artistically
he
expected
both
profit
and
fame
as
the
result
of
this
great
work
and
the
host
of
figures
it
contained
then
directly
the
master
was
gone
buffalmacco
hastened
to
make
his
preparations
for
the
enterprise
he
was
bent
upon
he
went
down
into
the
cellar
which
communicating
as
it
did
with
a
baker
next
door
was
full
of
cockroaches
drawn
thither
by
the
smell
of
the
sacks
of
flour
everybody
knows
how
cockroaches
or
swarm
in
bakeries
inns
and
these
are
a
sort
of
crawling
stinking
insects
with
long
ungainly
shaggy
legs
and
an
ugly
shell
of
a
dirty
yellow
during
the
civil
wars
that
stained
the
arbia
red
and
fertilized
the
with
the
blood
of
nobles
these
loathsome
insects
had
two
names
in
tuscany
the
florentines
called
them
siennese
and
the
siennese
florentines
footnote
it
would
be
better
to
speak
of
the
shell
is
an
utterly
unsuitable
word
not
in
the
least
fitting
the
oriental
cockroach
is
in
question
an
insect
familiar
in
almost
every
part
of
europe
footnote
in
russia
they
are
termed
prussians
and
in
prussia
russians
the
french
call
them
canting
creatures
hypocrites
the
good
buffalmacco
laughed
to
see
the
creatures
all
moving
up
and
down
and
in
and
out
looking
for
all
the
world
like
tiny
shields
of
a
host
of
pigmy
knights
jousting
in
a
fairy
tourney
ah
ah
he
cried
to
himself
they
are
bedevilled
what
they
are
they
would
not
enjoy
the
springtime
and
jupiter
punished
them
for
their
sluggishness
he
has
condemned
them
to
crawl
about
in
the
dark
weighed
down
by
their
useless
wings
an
to
men
to
make
the
most
of
life
in
the
heyday
of
youth
and
love
this
was
what
buffalmacco
said
to
himself
for
he
was
ready
enough
like
other
folk
to
see
in
nature
a
symbol
of
his
own
passions
and
inclinations
which
were
to
drink
to
divert
himself
with
pretty
women
and
sleep
his
fill
in
a
warm
bed
in
winter
and
a
nice
cool
one
in
summer
however
he
had
not
visited
the
cellar
to
ponder
on
symbols
and
emblems
and
he
was
not
long
in
carrying
out
his
plan
he
caught
two
dozen
of
the
cockroaches
without
regard
to
sex
or
age
and
popped
them
in
a
bag
he
had
brought
with
him
for
the
purpose
this
done
he
proceeded
to
hide
the
bag
under
his
bed
and
returned
to
the
workroom
where
his
comrades
bruno
and
calendrino
were
painting
from
the
master
sketches
the
good
francis
receiving
the
stigmata
and
meantime
devising
some
way
of
hoodwinking
memmi
the
cobbler
whose
wife
was
comely
and
obliging
buffalmacco
who
was
not
less
expert
far
from
it
than
his
two
comrades
mounted
the
ladder
and
started
painting
the
wings
of
the
seraphic
crucifix
that
came
down
from
heaven
to
mark
the
blessed
saint
with
the
five
wounds
of
love
taking
the
utmost
pains
to
blend
in
the
celestial
pinions
all
the
tenderest
hues
of
the
rainbow
the
task
occupied
him
all
day
and
when
old
tafi
came
back
from
san
giovanni
he
could
not
refrain
from
bestowing
a
few
words
of
commendation
on
his
pupil
this
cost
him
no
small
effort
for
age
and
riches
had
made
him
both
cross
and
critical
my
lads
he
said
addressing
the
apprentices
those
wings
are
painted
with
a
good
deal
of
spirit
buffalmacco
might
go
far
in
the
art
of
painting
if
he
would
only
apply
himself
more
vigorously
but
there
his
mind
is
far
too
much
set
on
and
great
achievements
can
only
be
accomplished
by
steady
labour
now
calendrino
here
would
beat
you
all
with
his
industry
if
he
were
not
a
born
fool
in
such
fashion
andrea
tafi
improved
the
occasion
with
a
proper
severity
then
having
said
his
say
he
went
to
the
kitchen
to
take
his
supper
which
consisted
of
a
bit
of
salt
fish
after
that
he
betook
himself
to
his
chamber
lay
down
in
his
bed
and
was
soon
snoring
meantime
buffalmacco
made
his
usual
round
through
every
quarter
of
the
city
where
wine
was
to
be
had
cheap
and
girls
cheaper
still
this
done
he
got
home
again
half
an
hour
or
so
before
the
time
tafi
generally
woke
he
drew
out
the
bag
from
under
his
bed
took
the
cockroaches
one
by
one
and
by
means
of
a
short
sharp
needle
fastened
a
little
wax
taper
on
the
back
of
each
lighting
the
tapers
he
let
the
insects
loose
one
after
the
other
in
the
room
the
creatures
are
too
stupid
to
feel
pain
or
if
they
do
to
manifest
any
great
panic
they
set
off
crawling
over
the
floor
at
a
pace
which
surprise
and
perhaps
some
vague
terror
made
a
trifle
quicker
than
usual
before
long
they
started
describing
circles
not
because
it
is
as
plato
says
a
perfect
figure
but
as
a
result
of
the
instinct
that
always
makes
insects
turn
round
and
round
in
their
efforts
to
escape
any
unknown
danger
buffalmacco
looked
on
from
the
of
his
bed
on
which
he
had
thrown
himself
and
congratulated
himself
on
the
success
of
his
device
and
indeed
nothing
could
be
more
marvellous
than
these
lights
showing
a
miniature
presentment
of
the
harmony
of
the
spheres
such
as
it
is
set
out
by
aristotle
and
his
commentators
the
cockroaches
themselves
were
invisible
only
the
little
flames
they
carried
could
be
seen
which
seemed
to
be
all
alive
just
as
these
same
lights
were
weaving
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
more
cycles
and
epicycles
than
ever
ptolemy
and
the
arabs
observed
as
they
watched
the
motions
of
the
planets
tafi
voice
made
itself
heard
shriller
than
ever
what
with
a
cold
in
the
head
and
what
with
annoyance
buffalmacco
buffalmacco
i
say
screamed
the
old
fellow
coughing
and
spitting
get
up
i
say
get
up
you
scoundrel
in
less
than
an
time
it
will
be
broad
daylight
the
bugs
in
your
bed
must
be
built
like
very
venuses
you
are
so
loath
to
leave
up
you
sluggard
if
you
do
rise
this
instant
i
drag
you
from
between
the
sheets
by
the
hair
of
your
head
and
your
long
ears
these
were
the
sort
of
terms
in
which
the
master
would
call
his
pupil
out
of
bed
in
the
dusk
of
every
morning
such
was
his
zeal
for
painting
and
on
this
occasion
receiving
no
reply
he
drew
on
his
hose
but
without
taking
time
to
pull
them
any
higher
than
his
knees
and
started
for
his
apprentice
bedroom
stumbling
at
every
step
this
was
exactly
what
buffalmacco
expected
and
directly
he
heard
the
clatter
of
his
master
footsteps
on
the
stairs
he
turned
his
nose
to
the
wall
and
pretended
to
be
fast
asleep
and
there
was
old
tafi
shouting
up
the
stairs
hilloa
but
you
a
grand
sleeper
i
have
you
out
of
your
slumbers
i
will
though
you
should
be
dreaming
this
very
moment
that
the
eleven
thousand
virgins
are
slipping
into
your
bed
begging
you
to
teach
what
what
with
these
words
on
his
lips
andrea
tafi
shoved
the
door
of
the
room
violently
open
then
catching
sight
of
the
points
of
fire
running
all
over
the
floor
he
stopped
dead
on
the
landing
and
fell
in
every
limb
they
devils
he
thought
never
a
doubt
of
it
devils
and
evil
spirits
why
they
move
with
a
sort
of
mathematical
precision
which
is
their
strong
point
i
always
been
told
naturally
the
demons
hate
us
painters
who
depict
them
under
hideous
shapes
in
contrast
with
the
angels
we
represent
in
glory
an
aureole
about
their
brows
and
waving
wings
of
dazzling
splendour
the
unhappy
boy
is
beset
with
devils
i
can
count
at
least
a
thousand
around
his
pallet
no
doubt
he
has
angered
lucifer
himself
by
drawing
some
horrible
picture
of
him
is
only
too
likely
these
ten
thousand
imps
here
will
leap
upon
him
and
carry
him
off
alive
to
hell
his
doom
is
fixed
and
alack
i
have
myself
figured
in
mosaic
and
other
ways
very
odious
caricatures
of
devils
and
they
have
good
reason
to
bear
me
a
grudge
too
the
thought
redoubled
his
fears
and
hauling
up
his
hose
he
took
to
his
heels
too
much
terrified
to
think
of
facing
the
hundred
thousand
hobgoblins
he
had
seen
wheeling
round
and
round
with
bodies
of
fire
and
dashed
down
the
stairs
as
fast
as
ever
his
old
legs
would
carry
him
buffalmacco
had
a
fine
laugh
under
the
sheets
and
for
once
in
a
way
slept
on
till
broad
daylight
nor
did
his
master
ever
again
dare
to
go
and
wake
him
ii
the
ascending
up
of
andrea
tafi
andrea
tafi
of
florence
being
chosen
to
decorate
the
cupola
of
san
giovanni
with
mosaics
carried
out
the
said
work
in
the
most
perfect
fashion
every
figure
was
treated
in
the
greek
manner
which
tafi
had
learned
during
his
sojourn
at
venice
where
he
had
seen
workmen
busy
adorning
the
walls
of
san
marco
he
had
even
brought
back
with
him
from
that
city
a
greek
by
name
apollonius
who
knew
excellent
secrets
for
designing
in
mosaic
this
apollonius
was
a
skilful
workman
and
a
very
clever
man
he
knew
the
proportions
to
be
given
to
the
different
parts
of
the
human
body
and
the
material
for
mixing
the
best
cement
fearing
the
greek
might
carry
his
knowledge
and
address
to
some
other
painter
of
the
city
andrea
tafi
never
left
his
side
day
or
night
every
morning
he
took
him
with
him
to
san
giovanni
and
brought
him
home
every
evening
to
his
own
house
facing
san
michele
and
made
him
sleep
there
with
his
two
apprentices
bruno
and
buffalmacco
in
a
room
separated
merely
by
a
partition
from
his
own
and
as
this
partition
left
half
a
foot
between
the
top
and
the
beams
of
the
ceiling
whatever
was
said
in
one
room
could
easily
be
overheard
in
the
other
now
tafi
was
a
man
of
decent
manners
and
pious
he
was
not
like
some
painters
who
on
leaving
the
churches
where
they
have
been
depicting
god
creating
the
world
and
the
infant
jesus
in
his
holy
mother
arms
go
straight
to
houses
of
ill
fame
to
play
dice
and
drink
play
the
pipes
and
cuddle
the
girls
he
had
never
wished
for
better
than
his
good
wife
albeit
she
was
by
no
means
made
and
moulded
by
the
creator
to
afford
any
great
delight
to
men
for
she
was
a
very
dry
and
a
very
chilling
personage
then
after
god
had
removed
her
from
this
world
to
a
better
in
his
loving
mercy
andrea
took
no
other
woman
to
his
bosom
either
by
marriage
or
otherwise
on
the
contrary
he
was
strictly
continent
as
became
his
years
sparing
himself
both
expense
and
vexation
and
pleasing
god
to
boot
who
recompenses
in
the
next
world
the
privations
men
endure
in
this
andrea
tafi
was
chaste
sober
and
he
said
his
prayers
with
unfailing
regularity
and
being
got
to
bed
he
never
fell
asleep
without
first
invoking
the
blessed
virgin
in
these
words
holy
virgin
mother
of
god
which
for
thy
merits
wast
exalted
alive
to
heaven
stretch
forth
thy
hand
full
of
grace
and
mercy
to
me
to
lift
me
up
to
that
blessed
paradise
where
thou
sittest
on
a
chair
of
gold
and
this
petition
old
tafi
did
not
mumble
between
the
two
or
three
teeth
he
had
left
but
spoke
it
out
in
a
loud
strong
voice
persuaded
it
is
the
singing
as
they
say
makes
the
song
and
that
if
you
want
to
be
heard
it
is
best
to
shout
thus
it
came
about
that
master
supplication
was
overheard
every
night
by
apollonius
the
greek
and
the
two
young
florentines
who
lay
in
the
next
chamber
now
it
so
happened
apollonius
was
likewise
of
a
merry
humour
every
whit
as
ready
for
a
jest
as
bruno
or
buffalmacco
all
three
itched
sore
to
play
off
some
trick
on
the
old
painter
who
was
a
just
man
and
a
but
withal
and
a
cruel
taskmaster
accordingly
one
night
after
listening
to
the
old
fellow
customary
address
to
the
virgin
the
three
comrades
fell
under
the
and
cutting
a
hundred
jokes
presently
when
they
heard
him
snoring
they
began
asking
each
other
in
whispers
what
jape
they
could
play
off
on
him
well
knowing
the
holy
terror
the
old
man
had
of
the
devil
apollonius
proposed
to
go
dressed
in
red
with
horns
and
a
mask
to
drag
him
out
of
bed
by
the
feet
but
the
ingenious
buffalmacco
had
a
better
suggestion
to
offer
we
will
provide
ourselves
with
a
good
stout
rope
and
a
pulley
and
i
undertake
to
give
you
the
same
evening
a
highly
diverting
exhibition
apollonius
and
bruno
were
curious
to
know
what
the
pulley
and
rope
were
to
be
used
for
but
buffalmacco
refused
to
say
nevertheless
they
promised
faithfully
to
get
him
what
he
wanted
for
they
knew
him
to
possess
the
merriest
wit
in
the
world
and
the
most
fertile
in
amusing
contrivances
having
earned
his
nickname
of
buffalmacco
for
these
very
qualities
and
truly
he
knew
some
excellent
turns
that
have
since
become
legendary
the
three
friends
having
nothing
now
to
keep
them
awake
fell
asleep
under
the
moon
which
looking
in
at
the
garret
window
pointed
the
tip
of
one
of
her
horns
as
if
in
mockery
at
old
tafi
they
slept
sound
till
daybreak
when
the
master
began
hammering
on
the
partition
and
called
out
coughing
and
spitting
as
usual
get
up
master
apollonius
up
with
you
apprentices
day
come
phœbus
has
blown
out
the
sky
candles
quick
the
word
is
short
and
art
long
then
he
began
threatening
bruno
and
buffalmacco
he
would
come
and
start
them
out
with
a
bucket
of
cold
water
jeering
and
asking
them
is
your
bed
so
delicious
eh
have
you
got
helen
of
troy
there
so
loath
to
quit
the
sheets
meanwhile
he
was
slipping
on
his
hose
and
his
old
worn
hood
this
done
he
sallied
out
to
find
the
lads
waiting
on
the
landing
fully
dressed
and
with
their
tools
all
ready
that
morning
in
the
fair
church
of
san
giovanni
on
the
planking
that
mounted
to
the
cornice
the
work
went
on
merrily
for
a
while
for
the
last
week
the
master
had
been
trying
his
hardest
to
give
a
good
representation
according
to
the
recognized
rules
of
art
of
the
baptism
of
jesus
christ
he
had
just
begun
putting
in
the
fishes
swimming
in
the
jordan
apollonius
was
mixing
the
cement
with
bitumen
and
chopped
straw
pronouncing
words
of
might
known
only
to
himself
while
bruno
and
buffalmacco
were
picking
the
little
cubes
of
stone
to
be
used
and
tafi
arranging
them
according
to
the
sketch
he
had
made
on
a
slab
of
slate
he
held
in
his
hand
but
just
when
the
master
was
busiest
over
the
job
the
three
friends
sprang
lightly
down
the
ladder
and
slipped
out
of
the
church
bruno
went
off
to
the
house
of
calendrino
outside
the
walls
in
search
of
a
pulley
that
was
used
for
hoisting
corn
into
the
granary
at
the
same
time
apollonius
hurried
away
to
ripoli
to
see
an
old
lady
the
wife
of
a
judge
whom
he
had
promised
to
provide
with
a
philtre
to
draw
lovers
to
her
side
and
persuading
her
that
hemp
was
indispensable
for
compounding
the
potion
got
her
to
hand
him
over
the
a
good
stout
piece
of
cord
the
two
friends
next
met
at
tafi
house
where
they
found
buffalmacco
awaiting
them
the
latter
at
once
set
to
work
to
attach
the
pulley
firmly
to
the
of
the
roof
above
the
partition
separating
the
master
from
his
apprentices
then
after
passing
the
old
lady
through
the
pulley
he
left
one
end
hanging
down
in
their
own
chamber
while
he
went
into
his
master
apartment
and
fastened
the
bed
to
the
other
extremity
by
each
corner
he
took
good
care
the
rope
should
be
concealed
behind
the
curtains
so
that
nothing
out
of
the
way
might
be
visible
when
all
was
done
the
three
companions
went
back
to
san
giovanni
the
old
man
who
had
been
so
busily
engaged
as
scarcely
to
have
noticed
their
absence
addressed
them
with
a
beaming
face
look
you
he
said
how
those
fish
sparkle
with
divers
colours
and
particularly
with
gold
purple
and
blue
as
creatures
should
which
inhabit
the
ocean
and
the
rivers
and
which
possess
so
marvellous
a
brilliancy
of
hues
only
because
they
were
the
first
to
submit
to
the
empire
of
the
goddess
venus
as
is
all
explained
in
the
legend
thus
the
master
discoursed
in
a
way
full
of
grace
and
good
sense
for
you
must
know
he
was
a
man
of
wit
and
learning
albeit
his
humour
was
so
saturnine
and
grasping
above
all
when
his
thoughts
turned
toward
filthy
lucre
he
went
on
now
is
not
a
painter
trade
a
good
one
and
deserving
of
all
praise
it
wins
him
riches
in
this
world
and
happiness
in
the
next
for
be
sure
our
lord
jesus
christ
will
welcome
gratefully
in
his
holy
paradise
craftsmen
like
myself
who
have
portrayed
his
veritable
likeness
and
andrea
tafi
was
glad
at
heart
to
be
at
work
upon
this
great
picture
in
mosaic
whereof
several
portions
are
yet
visible
at
san
giovanni
to
this
day
presently
when
night
came
and
effaced
both
form
and
colour
in
all
the
church
he
tore
himself
regretfully
from
the
river
jordan
and
sought
his
house
he
supped
in
the
kitchen
off
a
couple
of
tomatoes
and
a
scrap
of
cheese
went
upstairs
to
his
room
undressed
in
the
dark
and
got
into
bed
no
sooner
was
he
laid
down
than
he
made
his
customary
prayer
to
the
blessed
virgin
holy
virgin
mother
of
god
which
for
thy
merits
wast
exalted
alive
to
heaven
stretch
forth
thy
hand
full
of
grace
and
mercy
to
me
to
lift
me
up
to
paradise
the
moment
was
come
which
the
three
companions
had
been
eagerly
awaiting
in
the
neighbouring
room
they
grasped
the
rope
end
that
hung
down
the
partition
from
the
pulley
and
scarcely
had
the
good
old
fellow
finished
his
supplication
when
at
a
sign
from
buffalmacco
they
hauled
so
vigorously
on
the
cord
that
the
bed
fastened
at
the
other
end
began
to
rise
from
the
floor
master
andrea
feeling
himself
being
hoisted
aloft
yet
without
seeing
how
got
it
into
his
head
it
was
the
blessed
virgin
answering
his
prayer
and
drawing
him
up
to
heaven
he
was
and
fell
in
a
quavering
voice
stop
stop
sweet
lady
i
never
asked
it
should
be
now
and
as
the
bed
rose
higher
and
higher
the
rope
working
smoothly
and
noiselessly
over
the
pulley
the
old
man
poured
out
the
most
pitiful
supplications
to
the
virgin
mary
good
lady
sweet
lady
do
pull
so
ho
there
let
go
i
say
but
she
seemed
not
to
hear
a
word
at
this
he
grew
furiously
angry
and
bellowed
you
must
be
deaf
you
let
go
of
a
seeing
he
was
leaving
the
floor
for
good
and
all
his
terror
increased
yet
further
and
calling
upon
jesus
he
besought
him
to
make
his
holy
mother
listen
to
reason
it
was
high
time
he
asseverated
she
should
give
up
this
mischancy
assumption
sinner
that
he
was
and
son
of
a
sinner
he
could
not
and
he
would
not
go
up
to
heaven
before
finished
the
river
jordan
the
waves
and
the
fishes
and
the
rest
of
our
blessed
lord
history
meanwhile
the
canopy
of
the
bed
was
all
but
touching
the
beams
of
the
roofing
and
tafi
was
crying
in
desperation
jesus
unless
you
stop
your
blessed
mother
this
instant
the
roof
of
my
house
which
cost
a
fine
penny
will
most
certainly
be
burst
up
for
i
see
for
sure
i
going
slap
through
it
stop
stop
i
can
hear
the
tiles
cracking
buffalmacco
perceived
that
by
now
his
master
voice
was
actually
strangling
in
his
throat
and
he
ordered
his
companions
to
let
go
the
rope
this
they
did
the
result
being
that
the
bed
tumbling
suddenly
from
roof
to
floor
of
the
room
crashed
down
on
the
boards
breaking
the
legs
and
splitting
the
panels
simultaneously
the
bedposts
toppled
over
and
the
canopy
curtains
hangings
and
all
fell
atop
of
master
andrea
who
thinking
he
was
going
to
be
smothered
started
howling
like
a
devil
incarnate
his
very
soul
staggered
under
the
shock
and
he
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
fallen
back
again
into
his
chamber
or
pitched
headlong
into
hell
at
this
point
the
three
apprentices
rushed
in
as
if
just
awakened
by
the
noise
seeing
the
ruins
of
the
bed
lying
smothered
in
clouds
of
dust
they
feigned
intense
surprise
and
instead
of
going
to
the
old
man
help
asked
him
if
it
was
the
devil
had
done
the
mischief
but
he
only
sighed
heavily
and
said
it
all
up
with
me
pull
me
out
of
this
i
a
dying
man
at
last
they
dragged
him
from
among
the
débris
under
which
he
was
ready
to
suffocate
and
placed
him
sitting
up
with
his
back
to
the
wall
he
breathed
hard
coughed
and
spat
and
my
lads
he
said
but
for
the
timely
succour
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
hurled
me
back
to
earth
again
with
a
violence
you
can
plainly
see
the
effects
of
i
should
at
this
present
moment
be
in
the
circle
of
heaven
named
the
crystalline
or
his
holy
mother
would
not
listen
to
a
word
in
my
fall
i
have
lost
three
teeth
which
without
being
exactly
sound
still
did
me
good
service
moreover
i
have
an
agonizing
pain
in
my
right
side
and
in
the
arm
that
holds
the
brush
my
master
said
apollonius
pityingly
you
must
have
received
some
internal
hurts
which
is
a
very
dangerous
thing
at
constantinople
in
the
risings
i
discovered
how
much
more
deadly
such
injuries
are
than
mere
external
wounds
but
never
fear
i
am
going
to
charm
away
the
mischief
with
spells
not
for
worlds
put
in
the
old
man
that
were
a
deadly
sin
but
come
hither
all
three
and
do
me
the
service
an
you
will
of
rubbing
me
well
in
the
worst
places
they
did
as
he
asked
and
never
left
him
till
they
had
pretty
well
scarified
every
bit
of
skin
off
the
old
fellow
back
and
loins
the
good
lads
made
it
their
first
business
to
sow
the
story
broadcast
through
the
city
this
they
did
to
such
good
effect
that
there
was
not
man
woman
nor
child
in
florence
could
look
master
andrea
tafi
in
the
face
without
bursting
out
laughing
now
one
morning
buffalmacco
was
passing
down
the
corso
messer
guido
the
son
of
the
signor
cavalcanti
who
was
on
his
way
to
the
marshes
to
shoot
crane
stopped
his
horse
called
the
apprentice
to
him
and
tossed
him
his
purse
with
the
words
ho
gentle
buffalmacco
here
somewhat
to
drink
to
the
health
of
epicurus
and
his
disciples
you
must
know
messer
guido
was
of
the
sect
of
the
epicureans
and
loved
to
marshal
arguments
against
the
existence
of
god
he
was
used
to
declare
the
death
of
men
is
precisely
the
same
as
that
of
beasts
buffalmacco
added
the
young
nobleman
this
purse
i
have
given
you
is
for
payment
of
the
very
instructive
complete
and
profitable
experiment
you
made
when
you
sent
old
tafi
to
heaven
who
seeing
his
carcass
taking
the
road
to
the
empyrean
began
to
squeal
like
a
pig
being
killed
this
proves
plainly
he
had
no
real
assurance
in
the
promised
joys
of
paradise
which
are
it
must
be
allowed
far
from
certain
in
the
same
way
as
nurses
tell
children
vague
things
are
talked
concerning
the
immortality
of
mortal
men
the
vulgar
herd
thinks
it
believes
these
tales
but
it
does
not
really
and
truly
hard
fact
comes
and
shivers
the
poets
fables
there
is
nothing
assured
but
the
sad
life
of
this
world
horace
the
roman
poet
is
of
my
opinion
when
he
says
in
cælum
footnote
it
be
long
ere
you
return
to
heaven
your
ode
of
book
i
addressed
to
augustus
iii
the
master
having
learned
the
art
of
preparing
and
using
the
proper
coats
and
colours
as
well
as
the
secret
of
painting
figures
in
the
good
manner
of
cimabuë
and
giotto
the
young
buonamico
cristofani
the
florentine
surnamed
buffalmacco
abandoned
the
workshop
of
his
master
andrea
tafi
and
proceeded
to
establish
himself
in
the
quarter
of
the
fullers
immediately
opposite
to
the
house
known
by
the
sign
of
the
goose
head
now
in
those
days
like
fair
ladies
outvying
one
another
in
wearing
gowns
broidered
with
flowers
the
towns
of
italy
made
it
their
pride
to
cover
the
walls
of
their
churches
and
cloisters
with
paintings
among
all
these
florence
was
the
most
sumptuous
and
magnificent
and
was
the
place
of
all
others
for
a
painter
to
live
in
buffalmacco
knew
how
to
give
his
figures
movement
and
expression
and
while
far
behind
the
divine
giotto
for
beauty
of
design
he
pleased
the
eye
by
the
gay
exuberance
of
his
inventions
so
he
was
not
long
in
getting
commissions
in
considerable
numbers
it
only
depended
on
himself
to
win
riches
and
fame
with
all
speed
but
his
chief
idea
was
to
amuse
himself
in
company
of
bruno
di
giovanni
and
nello
and
squander
along
with
them
in
debauchery
all
the
money
he
made
now
the
abbess
of
the
ladies
of
faenza
established
at
florence
determined
about
this
time
to
have
the
church
of
their
nunnery
decorated
with
frescoes
hearing
that
there
lived
in
the
quarter
of
the
fullers
and
a
very
clever
painter
named
buffalmacco
she
despatched
her
steward
thither
to
come
to
an
arrangement
with
him
as
to
the
execution
of
the
proposed
paintings
the
master
agreed
to
the
terms
offered
and
undertook
the
commission
readily
enough
he
had
a
scaffolding
erected
in
the
nunnery
church
and
on
the
still
moist
plaster
began
to
paint
with
wondrous
vigour
of
execution
the
history
of
jesus
christ
first
of
all
to
the
right
of
the
altar
he
illustrated
the
massacre
of
the
holy
innocents
and
succeeded
in
expressing
so
vividly
the
grief
and
rage
of
the
mothers
trying
vainly
to
save
their
little
ones
from
the
roman
soldiers
hands
that
the
very
wall
seemed
to
chant
like
the
faithful
in
church
crudelis
herodes
drawn
thither
by
curiosity
the
nuns
used
to
come
two
or
three
of
them
together
to
watch
the
master
at
work
at
sight
of
all
these
despairing
mothers
and
murdered
babes
they
could
not
help
sobbing
and
shedding
tears
in
particular
there
was
one
little
fellow
buffalmacco
had
drawn
lying
in
his
swaddling
bands
smiling
and
sucking
his
thumb
between
a
legs
the
nuns
begged
and
prayed
this
one
might
not
be
killed
oh
spare
him
they
said
to
the
painter
do
take
care
the
soldiers
do
see
him
and
kill
him
the
good
buffalmacco
answered
for
love
of
you
dear
sisters
i
will
protect
him
all
i
can
but
these
murderers
are
filled
with
so
savage
a
rage
it
will
be
a
difficult
matter
to
stop
them
when
they
declared
the
baby
such
a
little
darling
he
offered
to
make
each
of
them
a
little
darling
prettier
still
thank
you
kindly
they
answered
back
laughing
the
abbess
came
in
her
turn
to
assure
herself
with
her
own
eyes
that
the
work
was
being
done
satisfactorily
she
was
a
lady
of
very
high
birth
named
usimbalda
a
proud
severe
and
careful
personage
seeing
a
man
working
without
cloak
or
hood
and
like
a
common
labourer
wearing
only
shirt
and
hose
she
mistook
him
for
some
apprentice
lad
and
did
not
condescend
so
much
as
to
speak
to
him
she
came
again
and
again
five
or
six
times
to
the
chapel
without
ever
seeing
any
one
more
important
than
this
working
fellow
she
deemed
only
fit
to
grind
the
colours
out
of
all
patience
at
last
she
showed
him
she
was
far
from
satisfied
my
lad
she
bade
him
tell
your
master
from
me
he
must
come
and
work
himself
at
the
pictures
i
commissioned
him
to
paint
i
meant
them
to
be
the
work
of
his
own
hand
not
a
mere
apprentice
far
from
declaring
himself
buffalmacco
put
on
the
look
and
voice
of
a
poor
and
humbly
answered
usimbalda
that
he
saw
plain
enough
he
was
not
of
the
sort
to
inspire
confidence
in
so
noble
a
lady
and
that
his
duty
was
to
obey
i
will
inform
my
master
he
went
on
and
he
will
not
fail
to
put
himself
at
the
orders
of
my
lady
abbess
with
this
assurance
the
lady
usimbalda
left
the
church
no
sooner
was
he
alone
than
buffalmacco
arranged
on
the
scaffolding
just
at
the
spot
where
he
was
at
work
two
stools
with
a
crock
on
the
top
then
going
to
the
corner
where
he
had
laid
them
he
pulled
out
his
cloak
and
hat
which
as
it
happened
were
in
a
very
fair
state
of
freshness
and
put
them
on
the
lay
figure
he
had
improvised
next
he
stuck
a
brush
in
the
spout
of
the
crock
which
was
turned
towards
the
wall
this
done
after
assuring
himself
the
thing
had
quite
the
look
of
a
man
busy
painting
he
decamped
with
all
speed
determined
to
keep
away
till
he
had
seen
what
happened
next
day
the
nuns
paid
their
usual
visit
to
the
scene
of
action
but
finding
instead
of
the
merry
fellow
they
were
accustomed
to
a
stately
gentleman
who
held
himself
in
the
stiffest
of
attitudes
and
seemed
entirely
indisposed
to
laugh
and
talk
they
were
afraid
and
took
to
flight
madame
usimbalda
on
the
contrary
when
returned
to
the
church
was
delighted
to
see
the
master
at
work
in
lieu
of
the
apprentice
she
proceeded
to
give
him
much
valuable
advice
exhorting
him
for
a
good
ten
minutes
to
paint
figures
that
should
be
modest
noble
and
expressive
before
she
discovered
she
was
addressing
her
remarks
to
a
crock
she
would
hardly
have
found
out
her
mistake
even
then
had
she
not
grown
impatient
at
receiving
no
reply
and
pulling
the
master
by
his
cloak
brought
crock
stool
hat
brush
and
all
tumbling
at
her
feet
then
as
she
was
by
no
means
wanting
in
sense
she
saw
it
was
intended
as
a
lesson
not
to
judge
the
artist
by
his
dress
she
sent
her
steward
to
buffalmacco
and
begged
him
to
finish
what
he
had
begun
he
completed
the
work
greatly
to
his
credit
connoisseurs
especially
admired
in
these
frescoes
the
figure
of
the
crucified
redeemer
the
three
marys
weeping
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
judas
hanged
on
a
tree
and
a
man
blowing
his
nose
unfortunately
the
paintings
were
all
destroyed
along
with
the
church
of
the
nunnery
of
the
ladies
of
faenza
iv
the
painter
equally
famous
for
his
wit
and
humour
and
for
his
skill
in
devising
figure
subjects
on
the
walls
of
church
and
cloister
buonamico
surnamed
buffalmacco
had
already
left
his
youth
behind
when
he
was
invited
from
florence
to
arezzo
by
the
lord
bishop
of
that
city
who
wished
the
halls
of
his
palace
decorated
with
paintings
buffalmacco
undertook
the
commission
and
directly
the
walls
were
duly
laid
with
stucco
started
on
a
picture
of
the
adoration
of
the
wise
men
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
he
had
painted
in
king
melchior
complete
mounted
on
a
white
horse
looking
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
were
alive
his
horse
was
scarlet
dotted
with
precious
stones
now
all
the
time
he
was
at
work
the
bishop
pet
monkey
sat
staring
intently
at
his
proceedings
never
taking
his
eyes
off
him
whether
the
painter
was
squeezing
his
tubes
mixing
his
colours
beating
up
his
eggs
or
laying
on
the
colour
with
his
brush
on
the
moist
surface
the
creature
never
lost
one
of
his
movements
it
was
a
baboon
brought
from
barbary
for
the
doge
of
venice
in
one
of
the
state
galleys
the
doge
made
a
present
of
it
to
the
bishop
of
arezzo
who
thanked
his
magnificence
reminding
him
prettily
how
king
solomon
ships
had
in
like
fashion
imported
from
the
land
of
ophir
apes
and
peacocks
as
is
related
in
the
first
book
of
kings
x
and
there
was
nothing
in
all
his
palace
bishop
guido
held
more
precious
than
this
baboon
he
left
the
animal
to
roam
at
liberty
about
the
halls
and
gardens
where
it
was
for
ever
at
some
mischievous
trick
or
another
one
sunday
during
the
painter
absence
the
creature
climbed
up
on
the
scaffolding
laid
hold
of
the
tubes
mixed
up
the
colours
in
a
way
of
its
own
broke
all
the
eggs
it
could
find
and
began
plying
the
brush
on
the
wall
as
it
had
seen
the
other
do
it
worked
away
at
king
melchior
and
his
horse
never
leaving
off
till
the
whole
composition
was
repainted
according
to
its
own
ideas
next
morning
buffalmacco
finding
his
colours
all
and
his
work
spoiled
was
both
grieved
and
angry
he
was
persuaded
some
painter
of
arezzo
who
was
jealous
of
his
superior
skill
had
played
him
this
dirty
trick
and
went
straight
to
the
bishop
to
complain
the
latter
urged
him
to
set
to
work
again
and
repair
with
all
speed
what
had
been
ruined
in
a
manner
so
mysterious
he
undertook
that
for
the
future
two
soldiers
should
keep
guard
night
and
day
before
the
frescoes
with
orders
to
drive
their
lances
through
any
one
who
should
dare
to
come
near
on
this
condition
buffalmacco
agreed
to
resume
his
task
and
two
soldiers
were
put
on
sentry
close
at
hand
one
evening
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
hall
his
day
work
finished
the
soldiers
saw
the
lord
bishop
ape
spring
so
nimbly
into
his
place
on
the
scaffold
and
seize
the
and
brushes
with
such
rapidity
there
was
no
possibility
of
stopping
him
they
shouted
lustily
to
the
painter
who
came
back
just
in
time
to
see
the
baboon
paint
over
for
the
second
time
king
melchior
the
white
horse
and
the
scarlet
the
sight
was
like
to
move
poor
buffalmacco
at
one
and
the
same
time
to
laughter
and
tears
he
went
off
to
the
bishop
and
thus
addressed
him
my
lord
bishop
you
are
good
enough
to
admire
my
style
of
painting
but
your
baboon
prefers
a
different
what
need
to
have
had
me
summoned
here
when
you
had
a
master
painter
in
your
own
household
it
may
be
he
lacked
experience
but
now
he
has
nothing
left
to
learn
my
presence
here
is
quite
unnecessary
and
i
will
back
to
florence
having
so
said
the
good
buffalmacco
returned
to
his
inn
in
great
vexation
he
ate
his
supper
without
appetite
and
went
to
bed
in
a
very
dismal
frame
of
mind
then
the
lord
bishop
ape
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
not
a
mere
mannikin
as
he
was
in
reality
but
as
tall
as
monte
san
gemignano
cocking
up
a
prodigious
tail
and
tickling
the
moon
he
was
squatted
in
an
olive
wood
among
the
farms
and
while
betwixt
his
legs
a
narrow
road
ran
alongside
a
row
of
flourishing
vineyards
now
the
said
road
was
thronged
with
a
multitude
of
pilgrims
who
defiled
one
by
one
before
the
painter
eyes
and
lo
buffalmacco
recognized
the
countless
victims
of
his
practical
jokes
and
merry
humour
generally
he
saw
to
begin
with
his
old
master
andrea
tafi
who
had
taught
him
how
men
win
renown
by
practice
of
the
arts
and
whom
in
return
he
had
befooled
again
and
again
making
him
mistake
for
devils
of
hell
a
dozen
wax
tapers
pinned
on
the
backs
of
a
lot
of
great
cockroaches
and
hoisting
him
in
his
bed
to
the
joists
of
the
ceiling
so
that
the
poor
old
fellow
thought
he
was
being
carried
up
to
heaven
and
was
in
mortal
terror
he
saw
the
of
the
and
his
wife
that
notable
woman
at
the
into
this
good
dame
buffalmacco
had
been
wont
every
evening
to
throw
big
handfuls
of
salt
through
a
crack
in
the
wall
so
that
day
after
day
the
would
spit
out
his
porridge
and
beat
his
wife
he
saw
master
simon
de
villa
the
bolognese
physician
to
be
known
by
his
doctor
cap
the
same
he
had
pitched
into
the
cesspool
beside
the
convent
of
the
nuns
of
ripoli
the
doctor
ruined
his
best
velvet
gown
but
nobody
pitied
him
for
regardless
of
his
good
wife
claims
a
plain
woman
but
a
christian
he
had
longed
to
bed
with
prester
chinchimura
who
wears
horns
betwixt
her
sinful
buttocks
good
buffalmacco
had
persuaded
the
doctor
he
could
take
him
o
nights
to
the
witches
sabbath
where
he
went
himself
with
a
merry
company
to
make
love
to
the
queen
of
france
who
gave
him
wine
and
spices
for
his
doughty
deeds
simon
accepted
the
invitation
hoping
he
should
be
treated
right
royally
too
then
buffalmacco
having
donned
a
beast
skin
and
a
horned
mask
such
as
they
wear
at
came
to
master
simon
declaring
he
was
a
devil
ordered
to
conduct
him
to
the
sabbath
taking
him
on
his
shoulders
he
carried
him
to
the
edge
of
a
pit
full
of
filth
where
he
pitched
him
in
head
first
next
buffalmacco
saw
calendrino
whom
he
had
got
to
believe
that
the
stone
heliotropia
was
to
be
found
in
the
plain
of
the
mugnone
which
stone
possesses
the
virtue
of
rendering
invisible
whosoever
bears
it
about
his
person
he
took
him
to
mugnone
along
with
bruno
da
giovanni
and
when
calendrino
had
picked
up
a
very
large
number
of
stones
buffalmacco
suddenly
pretended
he
could
not
see
him
crying
out
the
scamp
has
given
us
the
slip
an
i
catch
him
i
bang
his
behind
with
this
and
he
landed
the
stone
exactly
where
he
said
he
would
without
calendrino
having
any
right
to
complain
because
he
was
invisible
this
same
calendrino
was
without
any
sense
of
humour
and
buffalmacco
played
on
his
simplicity
so
far
as
to
make
him
actually
believe
he
was
with
child
and
got
a
brace
of
fat
capons
out
of
him
as
fee
for
his
safe
delivery
next
buffalmacco
saw
the
countryman
for
whom
he
had
painted
the
blessed
virgin
with
the
infant
jesus
in
her
arms
afterwards
changing
the
babe
into
a
bear
cub
he
saw
moreover
the
abbess
of
the
nuns
of
faenza
who
had
commissioned
him
to
paint
the
walls
of
the
convent
church
in
fresco
and
he
told
her
on
his
oath
and
honour
you
must
mix
good
wine
with
the
colours
if
the
flesh
tints
are
to
be
really
brilliant
so
the
abbess
gave
him
for
every
saint
male
or
female
depicted
in
his
pictures
a
flask
of
the
wine
reserved
for
bishops
drinking
which
he
poured
down
his
throat
trusting
to
vermilion
to
bring
out
the
warm
tints
the
same
lady
abbess
it
was
he
deceived
making
her
take
a
pitcher
with
a
cloak
thrown
over
it
for
a
master
painter
as
has
been
already
recounted
buffalmacco
saw
besides
a
long
line
of
other
folks
he
had
befooled
cajoled
cozened
and
bemocked
closing
the
rear
marched
with
crozier
mitre
and
cope
the
great
sant
ercolano
whom
in
a
merry
mood
he
had
represented
in
the
great
square
of
perugia
girt
about
with
a
garland
of
gudgeons
all
as
they
passed
paid
their
compliment
to
the
ape
which
had
avenged
them
and
the
monster
opening
a
great
mouth
wider
than
the
jaws
of
hell
broke
into
a
mocking
laugh
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
buffalmacco
had
a
downright
bad
rest
the

wondrous

so
perfect
a
grace
of

that
the
learned
of
the
city
they
who
had
knowledge
of
history

legend
were
used
to
call
her
lady
mother
by
the
names

latona
leda

semele
making
implication
thereby
of
their
belief
that
the
fruit
of

had
been
framed
in
her
by
a
god
jupiter
rather
than
by
any
mortal
man
such
as
were
her
husband
and
lovers
but
the
wiser
heads
notably
the
fra
battista
whose
successor
i
am
as
superior
of

croce
held
that
such
exceeding
beauty
of
the
flesh
came
of
the
operation
of
the
devil
who
is
an
artist
in
the
sense
the

i
will
limit
myself
therefore
to
saying
that
many
strange
tales
were
bruited
concerning
the
birth
of
the
signora
eletta
i
saw
this
lady
for
the
first
time
on
the
piazza
of
verona
on
good
friday
of
the
year
when
she
had
just
completed
her
fourteenth
year
and
i
have
beheld
her
since
in
the
public
walks
and
the
churches
ladies
most
favour
she
was
like
a
picture
painted
by
a
very
excellent
limner
she
had
hair
of
wavy
gold
a
white
brow
eyes
of
a
colour
never
seen
but
in
the
precious
stone
called
aquamarine
cheeks
of
rose
a
nose
straight
and
finely
cut
her
mouth
was
a
cupid
bow
that
wounded
with
its
smiles
and
the
chin
was
as
full
of
laughter
as
the
mouth
her
whole
body
was
framed
to
perfection
for
the
delight
of
lovers
the
breasts
were
not
of
exaggerated
size
yet
showed
beneath
the
muslin
two
swelling
globes
of
a
full
and
most
winsome
roundness
as
well
by
reason
of
my
sacred
character
as
because
i
never
saw
her
but
clad
in
her
walking
dress
and
her
limbs
half
hidden
i
will
not
describe
the
other
parts
of
her
fair
body
which
one
and
all
proclaimed
their
perfection
through
the
stuffs
that
veiled
them
i
will
only
assure
you
that
when
she
was
in
her
accustomed
place
in
the
church
of
san
zenone
there
was
never
a
movement
she
could
make
whether
to
rise
to
her
feet
or
drop
on
her
knees
or
prostrate
herself
with
forehead
touching
the
stones
as
is
meet
to
do
at
the
instant
of
the
elevation
of
the
blessed
body
of
jesus
christ
without
straightway
inspiring
the
men
that
saw
her
with
an
ardent
longing
to
hold
her
pressed
to
their
bosom
now
it
came
about
that
signora
eletta
married
when
about
the
age
of
fifteen
messer
antonio
torlota
an
advocate
he
was
a
very
learned
man
of
good
repute
and
wealthy
but
already
far
advanced
in
years
and
so
heavy
and
misshapen
that
seeing
him
carrying
his
papers
in
a
great
leathern
bag
you
could
scarcely
tell
which
bag
it
was
dragging
about
the
other
it
was
pitiful
to
think
how
as
the
result
of
the
holy
sacrament
of
wedlock
which
is
instituted
among
men
for
their
glory
and
eternal
salvation
the
fairest
lady
of
verona
was
bedded
with
so
old
a
man
all
ruinate
in
health
and
vigour
and
wise
folk
saw
with
more
pain
than
wonder
that
profiting
by
the
freedom
allowed
her
by
her
husband
busied
all
night
long
as
he
was
solving
the
problems
of
justice
and
injustice
messer
torlota
young
wife
welcomed
to
her
bed
the
handsomest
and
most
proper
cavaliers
of
the
city
but
the
pleasure
she
took
therein
came
from
herself
not
from
them
at
all
it
was
her
own
self
she
loved
and
not
her
lovers
all
her
enjoyment
was
of
the
loveliness
of
her
own
proper
flesh
and
of
nothing
else
herself
was
her
own
desire
and
delight
and
her
own
fond
concupiscence
whereby
methinks
the
sin
of
carnal
indulgence
was
in
her
case
enormously
aggravated
for
albeit
this
sin
must
ever
divide
us
from
god
a
sufficient
sign
of
its
gravity
yet
is
it
true
to
say
that
carnal
offenders
are
regarded
by
the
sovereign
judge
both
in
this
world
and
the
next
with
less
indignation
than
are
covetous
men
traitors
murderers
and
wicked
men
who
have
made
traffic
of
holy
things
and
the
reason
of
this
is
that
the
naughty
desires
sensualists
entertain
being
directed
towards
others
rather
than
to
themselves
do
still
show
some
degraded
traces
of
true
love
and
gentle
charity
but
nothing
of
the
kind
was
to
be
seen
in
the
adulterous
amours
of
the
signora
eletta
who
in
every
passion
loved
herself
and
herself
only
and
herein
was
she
much
wider
separated
from
god
than
so
many
other
women
who
gave
way
to
their
wanton
desires
for
in
their
case
these
desires
were
towards
others
whereas
the
lady
eletta
had
none
but
herself
for
their
object
what
i
say
hereanent
i
say
to
make
more
understandable
the
conclusion
of
the
matter
which
i
must
now
relate
at
the
age
of
twenty
she
fell
sick
and
felt
herself
to
be
dying
then
she
bewailed
her
fair
body
with
the
most
piteous
tears
she
made
her
women
dress
her
out
in
her
richest
attire
looked
long
and
steadfastly
at
herself
in
the
mirror
fondled
with
both
hands
her
bosom
and
hips
to
enjoy
for
the
last
time
her
own
exceeding
beauty
and
aghast
at
the
thought
of
this
body
she
so
adored
being
eaten
of
the
worms
in
the
damp
earth
she
said
as
she
breathed
her
last

a
great
sigh
of
faith

my

was
borne
to

with
her
face
uncovered

within
the
memory
of
man
none
had
ever
seen
a
dead
woman
look
so
lovely
while
the
priests
were
chanting
the
offices
for
the
dead
around
her
bier
she
lay
as

swooning
with
delight
in
the
arms
of
an
invisible
lover

the
ceremony
was
over
the

closed

deposited
in

of
flowers
fenced
about
with
walls
he
had
knowledge
by
revelation
of
many
truths
that
escape
clever
and
men
and
ignorant
and
as
he
was
he
knew
things
unknown
to
the
most
learned

he
knew

make

poor

naked

would

the

themselves

pray
in

cover

kneeling
down
at

oak
spoke
to

one

take

take

pointing
in

slipped

the
man

arose
from

took

path
to

road
thither
he
met

asked
him
an
alms

have
nothing

superior
has
forbidden
me
to
cut
it
in
two
so
as
to
give
away
the
half
therefore
i
can
not
divide
it
with
you
but
if
you
love
me
my
son
you
will
take
it
off
me
whole
and
undivided
on
hearing
these
words
the
beggar
promptly
stripped
the
friar
of
his
gown
so
fra
giovanni
went
on
his
way
naked
under
the
falling
snow
and
entered
the
city
as
he
was
crossing
the
piazza
with
nothing
on
but
a
linen
cloth
about
his
loins
the
children
who
were
running
at
play
in
the
great
square
made
mock
at
him
in
derision
they
shook
their
fists
in
his
face
with
the
thumb
stuck
between
the
first
and
middle
fingers
and
threw
snow
at
him
mixed
with
mud
and
small
stones
now
there
lay
in
the
great
square
some
logs
of
timber
for
the
woodwork
of
a
house
and
one
of
the
logs
happened
to
be
balanced
across
another
two
children
ran
and
took
their
places
one
at
each
end
of
the
beam
and
began
playing
two
of
the
same
children
who
had
made
mock
of
the
holy
man
and
thrown
stones
at
him
he
went
up
to
them
now
smiling
and
said
dear
little
children
will
you
suffer
me
to
share
your
game
and
sitting
down
on
one
end
of
the
beam
he
up
and
down
against
the
two
little
ones
and
some
of
the
citizens
happening
to
pass
that
way
said
wondering
truly
and
indeed
the
man
is
out
of
his
wits
but
after
the
bells
had
rung
the
fra
giovanni
was
still
at
and
it
chanced
that
certain
priests
from
rome
who
had
come
to
viterbo
to
visit
the
mendicant
friars
whose
fame
was
great
through
the
world
just
then
crossed
the
great
square
and
hearing
the
children
shouting
look
little
brother
giovanni
here
the
priests
drew
near
the
monk
and
saluted
him
very
respectfully
but
the
holy
man
never
returned
their
salute
but
making
as
though
he
did
not
see
them
went
on
on
the
swaying
beam
so
the
priests
said
to
each
other
come
away
the
fellow
is
a
mere
dunce
and
dullard
then
was
fra
giovanni
glad
and
his
heart
overflowed
with
joy
for
these
things
he
did
out
of
humility
and
for
the
love
of
god
and
he
put
his
joy
in
the
scorn
of
men
as
the
miser
shuts
his
gold
in
a
cedarn
chest
locked
with
a
triple
lock
at
nightfall
he
knocked
at
the
monastery
door
and
being
admitted
appeared
among
the
brethren
naked
bleeding
and
covered
with
mire
he
smiled
and
said
a
kind
thief
took
my
gown
and
some
children
deemed
me
worthy
to
play
with
them
but
the
brothers
were
angry
because
he
had
dared
to
pass
through
the
city
in
so
undignified
a
plight
he
feels
no
compunction
they
declared
about
exposing
the
holy
order
of
francis
to
derision
and
disgrace
he
deserves
the
most
exemplary
punishment
the
general
of
the
order
being
warned
a
great
scandal
was
ruining
the
sacred
society
called
together
all
the
brethren
of
the
chapter
and
made
fra
giovanni
kneel
humbly
on
his
knees
in
the
midst
of
them
all
then
his
face
blazing
with
anger
he
chid
him
harshly
in
a
loud
rough
voice
this
done
he
consulted
the
assembly
as
to
the
penance
it
was
meet
to
impose
on
the
guilty
brother
some
were
for
having
him
put
in
prison
or
suspended
in
an
iron
cage
from
the
church
steeple
while
others
advised
he
should
be
chained
up
for
a
madman
and
fra
giovanni
beaming
with
satisfaction
told
them
you
are
very
right
my
brethren
i
deserve
these
punishments
and
worse
ones
still
i
am
good
for
nothing
but
foolishly
to
waste
and
squander
the
goods
of
god
and
of
my
order
and
brother
marcian
who
was
a
man
of
great
sternness
both
of
life
and
doctrine
cried
hear
him
he
talks
like
a
hypocrite
that
honeyed
voice
of
his
issues
from
a
whited
sepulchre
and
fra
giovanni
said
again
brother
marcian
i
am
indeed
capable
of
every
infamy
but
for
good
help
meantime
the
general
was
pondering
over
the
strange
behaviour
of
fra
giovanni
and
he
besought
the
holy
spirit
to
inspire
the
judgment
he
was
to
give
and
lo
as
he
prayed
his
anger
was
changed
into
admiration
he
had
known
francis
in
the
days
when
that
angel
of
heaven
born
of
a
woman
was
a
sojourner
in
this
world
and
the
ensample
of
the
favourite
follower
of
christ
had
taught
him
the
love
of
spiritual
perfection
so
his
soul
was
enlightened
and
he
recognized
in
the
works
of
fra
giovanni
a
divine
innocency
and
beauty
my
brethren
he
said
at
length
far
from
blaming
our
brother
let
us
admire
the
grace
he
receives
so
abundantly
from
god
in
very
truth
he
is
a
better
man
than
we
what
he
has
done
he
has
done
in
imitation
of
jesus
christ
who
the
little
children
to
come
unto
him
and
let
the
roman
soldiers
strip
him
of
his
garments
then
he
thus
addressed
the
kneeling
fra
giovanni
this
brother
is
the
penance
i
lay
upon
you
in
the
name
of
that
holy
obedience
you
owe
francis
i
command
you
go
forth
into
the
country
and
the
first
beggar
you
meet
beg
him
to
strip
you
of
your
tunic
then
when
he
has
left
you
naked
you
must
come
back
into
the
city
and
play
in
the
public
square
with
the
little
children
having
so
said
the
general
of
the
order
came
down
from
his
chair
of
state
and
raising
fra
giovanni
from
the
ground
fell
on
his
own
knees
before
him
and
kissed
his
feet
then
turning
to
the
assembled
monks
he
said
to
them
in
very
truth
my
brethren
this
man
is
the
good
god
plaything
ii
the
lamp
in
those
days
the
truth
was
revealed
to
fra
giovanni
that
the
riches
of
this
world
come
from
god
and
should
be
the
heritage
of
the
poor
who
are
the
favourite
children
of
jesus
christ
christian
folk
were
busy
celebrating
the
saviour
birth
and
fra
giovanni
had
come
to
the
town
of
assisi
which
is
set
upon
a
and
from
this
mountain
first
rose
the
sun
of
charity
now
the
day
before
christmas
eve
fra
giovanni
was
kneeling
in
prayer
before
the
altar
under
which
francis
sleeps
in
a
stone
coffin
and
he
was
meditating
dreaming
how
francis
was
born
in
a
stable
like
jesus
and
while
he
was
pondering
the
sacristan
came
up
to
him
and
asked
him
of
his
goodness
to
look
after
the
church
while
he
ate
his
supper
church
and
altar
were
both
loaded
with
precious
ornaments
gold
and
silver
were
there
in
abundance
for
the
sons
of
francis
had
long
fallen
from
their
early
poverty
and
had
received
gifts
from
the
queens
of
the
earth
fra
giovanni
assured
the
sacristan
go
brother
and
enjoy
your
meal
i
will
guard
the
church
as
our
lord
would
have
it
guarded
and
so
saying
he
went
on
with
his
meditations
and
as
he
knelt
there
alone
in
prayer
a
poor
woman
entered
the
church
and
asked
an
alms
of
him
for
the
love
of
god
i
have
nothing
the
holy
man
replied
but
the
altar
is
loaded
with
ornaments
and
i
will
go
see
if
i
can
not
find
something
to
give
you
a
golden
lamp
hung
above
the
altar
decked
about
with
silver
bells
examining
the
lamp
he
said
to
himself
those
little
bells
are
but
idle
vanities
the
true
ornament
of
yonder
altar
is
the
body
of
francis
which
reposes
naked
under
the
flags
with
a
black
stone
for
a
pillow
and
drawing
his
knife
from
his
pocket
he
detached
the
little
silver
bells
one
after
the
other
and
gave
them
to
the
poor
woman
presently
when
the
sacristan
his
meal
finished
returned
to
the
church
fra
giovanni
the
holy
man
of
god
said
to
him
never
trouble
my
brother
about
the
little
bells
that
belonged
to
the
lamp
i
have
given
them
away
to
a
poor
woman
who
had
need
of
them
now
fra
giovanni
did
in
this
wise
because
he
knew
by
revelation
that
all
the
things
in
this
world
belonging
to
god
belong
of
rights
to
the
poor
and
he
was
blamed
on
earth
by
men
whose
thoughts
were
given
over
to
riches
but
he
was
found
praiseworthy
in
the
sight
of
the
divine
goodness
iii
the
seraphic
doctor
fra
giovanni
was
not
proficient
in
the
knowledge
of
letters
and
he
rejoiced
in
his
ignorance
as
being
an
abundant
source
of
humiliations
but
after
watching
one
day
in
the
cloister
of
santa
maria
degli
angeli
a
number
of
doctors
of
theology
in
meditation
on
the
perfections
of
the
most
holy
trinity
and
the
mysteries
of
the
passion
he
began
to
doubt
whether
they
did
not
possess
the
love
of
god
more
fully
than
he
by
reason
of
their
wider
knowledge
he
was
afflicted
in
his
soul
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
fell
into
melancholy
but
sadness
was
unnatural
to
one
in
his
estate
for
joy
is
the
inheritance
of
the
poor
he
resolved
to
carry
his
difficulty
to
the
general
of
the
order
to
be
rid
of
it
as
of
a
galling
burden
now
giovanni
di
fidanza
was
general
of
the
order
in
those
days
in
the
cradle
he
had
received
from
francis
himself
the
name
of
bonaventure
he
had
studied
theology
at
the
university
of
paris
and
he
excelled
in
the
science
of
love
which
is
the
science
of
god
he
knew
the
four
degrees
which
lift
the
creature
to
his
creator
and
he
pondered
on
the
mystery
of
the
six
wings
of
the
cherubim
this
was
the
reason
why
he
was
called
the
seraphic
doctor
and
he
was
well
aware
that
science
is
vain
without
love
fra
giovanni
found
him
walking
in
his
garden
on
the
terrace
overlooking
the
city
it
was
a
sunday
and
the
handicraftsmen
of
the
town
and
the
peasants
who
work
in
the
vineyards
were
climbing
at
the
foot
of
the
terrace
the
steep
street
that
leads
to
the
church
and
fra
giovanni
seeing
brother
bonaventure
in
the
garden
in
the
midst
of
the
lilies
drew
near
and
said
brother
bonaventure
free
my
mind
of
the
doubt
that
is
tormenting
me
and
tell
me
can
an
ignorant
man
love
god
with
as
great
love
as
a
learned
doctor
of
the
church
and
brother
bonaventure
answered
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
fra
giovanni
a
poor
old
woman
may
not
only
equal
but
surpass
all
the
doctors
of
theology
in
the
world
and
seeing
the
sole
excellence
of
man
lies
in
loving
i
tell
you
again
the
most
ignorant
of
women
shall
be
exalted
in
heaven
above
the
doctors
fra
giovanni
on
hearing
these
words
was
filled
with
great
joy
and
leaning
out
over
the
low
wall
of
the
garden
looked
lovingly
at
the
then
he
cried
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
ho
you
poor
women
ignorant
and
you
shall
be
set
in
heaven
above
brother
bonaventure
and
the
seraphic
doctor
hearing
the
good
brother
proclamation
smiled
sweetly
where
he
stood
among
the
lilies
of
his
garden
iv
the
loaf
on
the
flat
stone
forasmuch
as
the
good
francis
had
bidden
his
sons
to
go
beg
your
bread
from
door
to
door
fra
giovanni
was
one
day
sent
to
a
certain
city
having
passed
the
gate
he
went
up
and
down
the
streets
to
beg
his
bread
from
door
to
door
according
to
the
rule
of
the
order
for
the
love
of
god
but
the
folk
of
that
city
were
more
covetous
than
the
men
of
lucca
and
harder
than
they
of
perugia
the
bakers
and
tanners
who
were
dicing
before
their
repulsed
the
poor
man
of
jesus
christ
with
harsh
words
even
the
young
women
holding
their
babes
in
their
arms
turned
their
faces
from
him
and
when
the
good
brother
whose
joy
was
in
dishonour
smiled
at
the
refusals
and
insults
he
received
he
is
laughing
at
us
said
the
townsmen
to
each
other
he
is
a
born
fool
or
say
rather
a
vagabond
impostor
and
a
drunkard
he
has
himself
with
wine
it
were
a
sin
and
a
shame
to
give
him
so
much
as
a
crumb
of
bread
from
our
hutch
and
the
good
brother
answered
you
say
true
my
friends
i
am
not
worthy
to
stir
your
pity
nor
fit
to
share
the
food
of
your
dogs
and
your
pigs
the
children
who
were
just
then
coming
out
of
school
overheard
what
was
said
and
ran
after
the
holy
man
shouting
madman
madman
and
pelted
him
with
mud
and
stones
then
fra
giovanni
went
forth
into
the
country
the
city
was
built
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
and
was
surrounded
by
vineyards
and
oliveyards
he
descended
the
hill
by
a
hollow
way
and
seeing
on
either
side
the
grapes
of
the
vines
that
hung
down
from
the
branches
of
the
elms
he
stretched
out
his
arm
and
blessed
the
clusters
likewise
he
blessed
the
olive
and
the
mulberry
trees
and
all
the
wheat
of
the
lowlands
meantime
he
was
both
hungry
and
thirsty
and
he
took
delight
in
thirst
and
hunger
at
the
end
of
a
he
saw
a
wood
of
laurels
and
it
was
the
habit
of
the
begging
friars
to
go
and
pray
in
the
woods
amongst
the
poor
animals
cruel
men
hunt
and
harry
accordingly
fra
giovanni
entered
the
wood
and
fared
on
by
the
side
of
a
brook
that
ran
clear
and
singing
on
its
way
presently
he
saw
a
flat
stone
beside
the
brook
and
at
the
same
moment
a
young
man
of
a
wondrous
beauty
clad
in
a
white
robe
laid
a
loaf
of
bread
on
the
stone
and
disappeared
and
fra
giovanni
knelt
down
and
prayed
saying
o
god
how
good
art
thou
to
send
thy
poor
man
bread
by
the
hand
of
one
of
thy
angels
o
blessed
poverty
o
very
glorious
and
most
sumptuous
poverty
and
he
ate
the
loaf
the
angel
had
brought
and
drank
the
water
of
the
brook
and
was
strengthened
in
body
and
in
soul
and
an
invisible
hand
wrote
on
the
walls
of
the
city
woe
woe
to
the
rich
v
the
table
under
the
following
the
example
of
francis
his
father
fra
giovanni
used
to
visit
the
hospital
of
viterbo
to
help
the
lepers
giving
them
to
drink
and
washing
their
sores
and
if
they
blasphemed
he
used
to
tell
them
you
are
the
chosen
sons
of
jesus
christ
and
there
were
some
lepers
of
a
very
humble
spirit
whom
he
would
gather
together
in
a
chamber
and
with
whom
he
took
delight
as
a
mother
does
surrounded
by
her
children
but
the
hospital
walls
were
very
thick
and
daylight
entered
only
by
narrow
windows
high
up
above
the
floor
the
air
was
so
fetid
the
lepers
could
scarce
live
in
the
place
at
all
and
fra
giovanni
noted
how
one
of
them
by
name
lucido
who
showed
an
exemplary
patience
was
slowly
dying
of
the
evil
atmosphere
fra
giovanni
loved
lucido
and
would
tell
him
my
brother
you
are
lucido
and
no
precious
stone
is
purer
than
your
heart
in
the
eyes
of
god
and
observing
how
lucido
suffered
more
sorely
than
the
others
from
the
poisonous
air
they
breathed
in
the
lepers
ward
he
said
to
him
one
day
friend
lucido
dear
lamb
of
the
lord
while
the
very
air
they
breathe
in
this
place
is
pestilence
in
the
gardens
of
santa
maria
degli
angeli
we
inhale
the
sweet
scent
of
the
laburnums
come
you
with
me
to
the
house
of
the
poor
brethren
and
you
will
find
relief
so
speaking
he
took
the
leper
by
the
arm
wrapped
him
in
his
own
cloak
and
led
him
away
to
santa
maria
degli
angeli
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
monastery
he
summoned
the
doorkeeper
with
happy
shouts
of
exultation
open
he
cried
open
to
the
friend
i
am
bringing
you
his
name
is
lucido
and
a
good
name
it
is
for
he
is
a
very
pearl
of
patience
the
brother
opened
the
gate
but
the
instant
he
saw
in
fra
arms
a
man
whose
face
livid
and
all
but
expressionless
was
covered
over
with
scales
he
knew
him
for
a
leper
and
rushed
off
in
terror
to
warn
the
brother
superior
the
latter
name
was
andrea
of
padua
and
he
was
a
man
of
very
holy
life
nevertheless
when
he
learned
that
fra
giovanni
was
bringing
a
leper
into
the
house
of
santa
maria
degli
angeli
he
was
very
wroth
and
coming
to
him
with
a
face
burning
with
anger
bade
him
stay
there
outside
with
the
man
you
are
a
senseless
fool
to
expose
your
brethren
thus
to
contagion
fra
giovanni
only
looked
on
the
ground
without
venturing
any
reply
all
the
joy
was
gone
from
his
face
and
lucido
seeing
him
troubled
brother
said
he
i
am
grieved
you
are
made
sad
because
of
me
and
fra
giovanni
kissed
the
leper
on
the
cheek
then
he
said
turning
to
the
superior
will
you
suffer
me
my
father
to
stay
outside
the
gate
with
this
man
and
share
my
meal
with
him
to
which
the
father
superior
answered
even
do
as
you
please
seeing
you
set
up
yourself
above
the
holy
rule
of
obedience
and
with
these
harsh
words
he
went
back
again
into
the
monastery
now
in
front
of
the
gate
was
a
stone
bench
under
a
and
on
this
bench
fra
giovanni
set
down
his
bowl
but
while
he
was
supping
with
the
leper
the
father
superior
had
the
gate
thrown
open
and
came
and
sat
under
the
and
said
forgive
me
fra
giovanni
for
having
given
you
offence
i
am
come
hither
now
to
share
your
meal
vi
the
temptation
then
satan
sat
him
down
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
and
gazed
down
at
the
house
of
the
poor
brethren
he
was
black
and
beautiful
like
a
young
egyptian
and
he
thought
in
his
heart
forasmuch
as
i
am
the
enemy
of
mankind
and
the
adversary
of
god
therefore
will
i
tempt
these
monks
and
i
will
tell
them
what
is
kept
hid
by
him
who
is
their
friend
lo
i
will
afflict
these
men
of
religion
by
telling
them
the
truth
and
i
will
darken
their
spirit
uttering
to
them
words
of
verity
and
reasonableness
i
will
plunge
reflexion
like
a
sword
in
their
reins
and
so
soon
as
they
shall
know
the
reality
of
things
they
will
be
unhappy
for
joy
there
is
none
but
in
illusion
and
peace
is
only
to
be
found
in
ignorance
and
because
i
am
the
master
of
such
as
study
the
nature
of
plants
and
animals
the
virtue
of
stones
the
secrets
of
fire
the
courses
of
the
stars
and
the
influence
of
the
planets
for
this
reason
men
have
named
me
the
prince
of
darkness
likewise
they
call
me
the
wily
one
because
by
me
was
constructed
the
whereby
ulpian
straightened
out
the
law
and
my
kingdom
is
of
this
world
well
then
i
will
try
these
monks
and
i
will
make
them
to
know
their
works
are
evil
and
that
the
tree
of
their
charity
bears
bitter
fruit
yea
i
will
tempt
them
without
hate
and
without
love
thus
said
satan
in
his
heart
meantime
as
the
shades
of
evening
were
lengthening
along
the
base
of
the
hills
and
the
cottage
chimneys
were
smoking
for
the
evening
meal
the
holy
man
giovanni
issued
from
out
the
wood
where
he
was
wont
to
pray
and
turned
into
the
road
leading
to
santa
maria
degli
angeli
saying
my
house
is
the
house
of
joy
and
delight
because
it
is
the
house
of
poverty
and
seeing
fra
giovanni
wending
his
way
homewards
satan
thought
lo
here
is
one
of
those
men
i
am
come
to
tempt
and
drawing
his
black
cloak
over
his
head
he
advanced
along
the
high
road
which
was
bordered
with
terebinths
to
meet
the
holy
man
now
satan
had
made
himself
like
a
with
a
veil
and
when
he
had
joined
fra
giovanni
he
put
on
a
honeyed
voice
and
asked
an
alms
of
him
saying
give
me
an
alms
for
the
love
of
him
who
is
your
friend
and
whom
i
am
not
worthy
so
much
as
to
name
and
fra
giovanni
answered
it
happens
so
i
have
with
me
a
little
silver
cup
a
nobleman
of
the
countryside
gave
me
to
have
it
melted
down
and
used
for
the
altar
of
santa
maria
degli
angeli
you
may
take
that
lady
and
i
will
go
and
ask
the
nobleman
to
let
me
have
another
of
the
same
weight
for
the
blessed
virgin
thus
will
his
wishes
be
accomplished
and
over
and
above
you
will
have
gotten
an
alms
for
the
love
of
god
satan
took
the
cup
and
said
good
brother
suffer
a
poor
to
kiss
your
hand
for
verily
the
hand
that
gives
gifts
is
soft
and
fragrant
fra
giovanni
replied
lady
be
heedful
not
to
kiss
my
hand
on
the
contrary
begone
with
all
speed
for
methinks
you
are
winsome
of
face
albeit
black
as
the
magian
king
that
bore
the
frankincense
and
myrrh
and
it
is
not
becoming
i
should
look
on
you
longer
seeing
how
danger
is
forever
dogging
the
lonely
man
steps
wherefore
suffer
me
now
to
leave
you
commending
you
to
god
care
and
forgive
me
if
i
have
failed
aught
in
politeness
towards
you
lady
for
the
good
francis
was
used
to
say
shall
be
the
ornament
of
my
sons
as
the
flowers
bedeck
the
but
satan
said
again
good
father
inform
me
at
the
least
of
a
where
i
may
pass
the
night
honestly
fra
giovanni
replied
go
mistress
to
the
house
of
damian
where
dwell
the
poor
ladies
of
our
lord
she
who
will
welcome
you
is
clare
and
indeed
she
is
a
clear
mirror
of
purity
the
same
is
the
duchess
of
poverty
and
satan
said
again
my
father
i
am
an
adulterous
woman
and
i
have
lain
with
many
men
and
fra
giovanni
said
lady
if
i
really
deemed
you
laden
with
the
sins
you
tell
of
i
would
crave
of
you
as
a
high
honour
to
kiss
your
feet
for
i
am
less
worth
than
you
and
your
crimes
are
little
compared
with
mine
yet
have
i
received
greater
favours
of
heaven
than
have
been
accorded
to
you
for
in
the
days
when
francis
and
his
twelve
disciples
were
still
upon
earth
i
lived
with
angels
of
heaven
and
satan
returned
my
father
when
i
asked
you
an
alms
for
the
love
of
him
who
loves
you
i
was
cherishing
in
my
heart
a
wicked
intent
and
i
am
fain
to
tell
you
what
this
was
i
wander
the
roads
in
order
to
collect
a
sum
of
money
i
destine
for
a
man
of
perosa
who
is
my
paramour
and
who
has
promised
me
on
handling
this
money
to
kill
traitorously
a
certain
knight
i
hate
because
when
i
offered
my
body
to
him
he
scorned
me
well
the
total
was
yet
incomplete
but
now
the
weight
of
your
silver
cup
has
made
it
up
so
the
alms
you
have
given
me
will
be
the
price
of
blood
you
have
sold
a
just
man
to
death
for
the
knight
i
told
you
of
is
chaste
temperate
and
pious
and
i
hate
him
for
this
cause
is
you
will
have
brought
about
his
murder
you
have
laid
a
weight
of
silver
in
the
scale
of
crime
to
bear
it
down
hearing
these
words
the
good
fra
giovanni
wept
and
drawing
aside
he
fell
on
his
knees
in
a
and
prayed
the
lord
saying
o
lord
make
this
crime
to
fall
neither
on
this
woman
head
nor
on
mine
nor
on
that
of
any
of
thy
creatures
but
let
it
be
put
beneath
thy
feet
which
were
pierced
with
the
nails
and
be
washed
in
thy
most
precious
blood
distil
on
me
and
on
this
my
sister
of
the
highway
a
drop
of
hyssop
and
we
shall
be
purified
and
shall
overpass
the
snow
in
whiteness
but
the
enemy
fled
away
thinking
this
man
i
have
not
been
able
to
tempt
by
reason
of
his
utter
simplicity
vii
the
subtle
doctor
satan
returned
and
sat
on
the
mountain
that
looks
towards
viterbo
laughing
under
its
crown
of
olives
and
he
said
in
his
heart
i
will
tempt
that
man
yonder
he
conceived
this
purpose
in
his
spirit
because
he
had
seen
fra
giovanni
girt
about
with
a
cord
and
a
sack
over
his
shoulder
crossing
the
meadows
below
on
his
way
to
the
city
to
beg
his
bread
there
according
to
the
rules
so
satan
took
on
the
appearance
of
a
holy
bishop
and
came
down
into
the
plain
a
mitre
was
on
his
head
sparkling
with
precious
stones
that
flashed
like
actual
fire
in
the
sunlight
his
cope
was
covered
with
figures
embroidered
and
painted
so
beautifully
no
craftsman
in
all
the
world
could
have
wrought
their
like
amongst
the
rest
he
was
depicted
himself
in
silk
and
gold
under
the
guise
of
a
george
and
a
sebastian
as
also
under
that
of
a
virgin
catherine
and
the
empress
helena
the
loveliness
of
the
faces
troubled
the
mind
and
saddened
the
heart
the
garment
was
truly
of
a
wondrous
workmanship
and
nothing
so
rich
and
rare
is
to
be
seen
in
the
treasuries
of
churches
thus
decked
in
cope
and
mitre
and
majestic
as
ambrose
the
glory
of
milan
satan
pursued
his
way
leaning
on
his
crozier
over
the
flowery
plain
presently
nearing
the
holy
man
he
hailed
him
and
said
peace
be
with
you
but
he
said
not
of
what
sort
this
peace
was
and
fra
giovanni
supposed
it
was
the
peace
of
the
lord
he
thought
to
himself
this
bishop
who
gives
me
the
salutation
of
peace
was
doubtless
in
his
lifetime
a
sainted
pontiff
and
a
blessed
martyr
unshakable
in
his
constancy
that
is
why
jesus
christ
has
changed
the
wooden
cross
to
a
golden
in
the
hands
of
this
gallant
confessor
of
the
faith
he
is
powerful
in
heaven
and
lo
after
his
holy
and
happy
death
he
walks
in
these
meadows
that
are
painted
with
flowers
and
broidered
with
pearls
of
dew
such
were
the
good
giovanni
thoughts
and
he
was
in
no
wise
abashed
so
saluting
satan
with
a
deep
reverence
he
said
sir
you
are
exceeding
gracious
to
appear
to
a
poor
man
such
as
i
but
indeed
these
meadows
are
so
lovely
is
no
wonder
if
the
saints
of
paradise
come
to
walk
here
they
are
painted
with
flowers
and
broidered
with
pearls
of
dew
the
lord
did
very
kindly
when
he
made
them
and
satan
said
to
him
it
is
not
the
meadows
it
is
your
heart
i
am
fain
to
look
at
i
have
come
down
from
the
mountain
to
speak
with
you
i
have
in
bygone
centuries
held
many
high
disputations
in
the
church
amid
the
assembled
doctors
my
voice
would
boom
forth
like
thunder
and
my
thoughts
flash
like
lightning
i
am
very
learned
and
they
name
me
the
subtle
doctor
i
have
disputed
with
god
angels
now
i
would
hold
dispute
with
you
fra
giovanni
made
answer
nay
but
how
should
the
poor
little
man
that
i
am
hold
dispute
with
the
subtle
doctor
i
know
nothing
and
my
simplicity
is
such
i
can
keep
nothing
in
my
head
but
those
songs
in
the
vulgar
tongue
where
they
have
stuck
in
rhymes
to
help
the
memory
as
in
mirror
of
my
soul
cleanse
my
heart
and
make
it
whole
or
in
mary
maid
of
flowers
lead
me
to
the
heavenly
bowers
and
satan
answered
fra
giovanni
the
venetian
ladies
amuse
their
leisure
and
show
their
adroitness
in
fitting
a
multitude
of
little
pieces
of
ivory
into
a
box
of
which
at
the
seemed
all
too
small
to
contain
so
many
in
the
same
fashion
i
will
pack
ideas
into
your
head
that
no
one
would
have
dreamed
it
could
ever
hold
and
i
will
fill
you
with
a
new
wisdom
i
will
show
that
thinking
to
walk
in
the
right
way
you
are
straying
abroad
all
the
while
like
a
drunken
man
and
that
you
are
driving
the
plough
without
any
heed
to
draw
the
furrows
straight
fra
giovanni
humbled
himself
saying
it
is
most
true
i
am
a
fool
and
do
nothing
but
what
is
wrong
then
satan
asked
him
what
think
you
of
poverty
and
the
holy
man
replied
i
think
it
is
a
pearl
of
price
but
satan
retorted
you
pretend
poverty
is
a
great
good
yet
all
the
while
you
are
robbing
the
poor
of
a
part
of
this
great
good
by
giving
them
alms
fra
giovanni
pondered
over
this
and
said
the
alms
i
give
i
give
to
our
lord
jesus
christ
whose
poverty
can
not
be
minished
for
it
is
infinite
it
gushes
from
him
as
from
an
inexhaustible
fountain
and
its
waters
flow
freely
for
his
favourite
sons
and
these
shall
be
poor
always
according
to
the
promise
of
the
son
of
god
in
giving
to
the
poor
i
am
giving
not
to
men
but
to
god
as
the
citizens
pay
tax
to
the
podestà
and
the
rate
is
for
the
city
which
of
the
money
it
so
receives
supplies
the
town
needs
now
what
i
give
is
for
paving
the
city
of
god
it
is
a
vain
thing
to
be
poor
in
deed
if
we
be
not
poor
in
spirit
the
gown
of
frieze
the
cord
the
sandals
the
wallet
and
the
wooden
bowl
are
only
signs
and
symbols
the
poverty
i
love
is
spiritual
and
i
address
her
as
because
she
is
an
idea
and
all
beauty
resides
in
this
same
idea
satan
smiled
and
replied
your
maxims
fra
giovanni
are
the
maxims
of
a
wise
man
of
greece
diogenes
by
name
who
taught
at
their
universities
in
the
times
when
alexander
of
macedon
was
waging
his
wars
and
satan
said
again
is
it
true
you
despise
the
goods
of
this
world
and
fra
giovanni
replied
i
do
despise
them
and
satan
said
to
him
look
you
in
scorning
these
you
are
scorning
at
the
same
time
the
men
who
produce
them
and
so
doing
fulfil
the
order
given
to
your
first
father
adam
when
he
was
commanded
the
sweat
of
thy
face
thou
shalt
eat
bread
seeing
work
is
good
the
fruit
of
this
work
is
good
too
yet
you
work
not
neither
have
any
care
for
the
work
of
others
but
you
receive
and
give
alms
in
contempt
of
the
law
laid
on
adam
and
on
his
seed
through
the
ages
alas
sighed
brother
giovanni
i
am
laden
with
crimes
and
at
once
the
most
wicked
and
the
most
foolish
man
in
all
the
world
wherefore
never
heed
me
but
read
in
the
book
our
lord
said
the
lilies
of
the
field
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
again
he
said
hath
chosen
the
good
part
which
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
her
then
satan
lifted
up
his
hand
with
the
gesture
of
one
who
disputes
and
prepares
to
count
off
his
arguments
on
the
fingers
and
he
said
giovanni
giovanni
what
was
written
in
one
sense
you
read
in
another
you
are
less
like
a
doctor
at
his
desk
than
an
ass
at
the
manger
so
must
i
correct
you
as
a
master
corrects
his
scholar
it
is
written
the
lilies
of
the
field
have
no
need
to
spin
because
they
are
beautiful
and
beauty
is
a
virtue
again
it
is
written
how
mary
is
not
to
do
the
household
tasks
because
she
is
doing
lovingly
to
him
who
has
come
to
see
her
but
you
who
are
not
beautiful
nor
yet
instructed
like
mary
in
the
things
of
love
you
drag
out
a
contemptible
existence
wandering
the
highways
giovanni
made
reply
sir
just
as
a
painter
will
depict
on
a
narrow
panel
of
wood
an
entire
city
with
its
houses
and
towers
and
walls
so
you
have
painted
in
a
few
words
my
soul
and
my
similitude
with
a
wondrous
exactness
and
i
am
altogether
what
you
describe
but
if
i
followed
perfectly
the
rule
etablished
by
francis
that
angel
of
god
and
if
i
practised
spiritual
poverty
to
the
full
i
should
be
the
lily
of
the
fields
and
i
should
have
the
good
part
of
mary
but
satan
interrupted
him
and
cried
you
profess
to
love
the
poor
yet
you
prefer
the
rich
man
and
his
riches
and
adore
him
who
possesses
treasures
to
give
away
and
fra
giovanni
answered
he
i
love
possesses
not
the
good
things
of
the
body
but
those
of
the
spirit
and
satan
retorted
all
good
things
are
of
the
flesh
and
are
tasted
of
through
the
flesh
this
epicurus
taught
and
horace
the
satirist
said
the
same
in
his
verses
at
these
words
the
holy
man
only
sighed
and
said
sir
i
can
not
tell
what
you
mean
satan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
my
words
are
exact
and
literal
yet
the
man
can
not
tell
what
i
mean
i
have
disputed
with
augustine
and
jerome
with
gregory
and
him
of
the
golden
mouth
chrysostom
and
they
comprehended
me
still
less
miserable
men
walk
groping
in
the
dark
and
error
lifts
over
their
head
her
monstrous
canopy
simple
and
sage
alike
are
the
plaything
of
eternal
falsehood
and
satan
said
again
to
the
holy
man
giovanni
have
you
won
happiness
if
you
have
happiness
i
shall
not
prevail
against
you
a
man
thoughts
are
only
stirred
by
sorrow
and
their
meditations
by
grief
then
tortured
by
fears
and
desires
he
turns
anxiously
in
his
bed
and
rends
his
pillow
with
lies
what
use
to
tempt
this
man
he
is
happy
but
fra
giovanni
sighed
sir
i
am
less
happy
since
listening
to
you
your
words
trouble
my
mind
on
hearing
this
satan
cast
away
his
pastoral
staff
his
mitre
and
his
cope
and
stood
there
naked
and
unashamed
he
was
black
and
more
beautiful
than
the
loveliest
of
the
angels
he
smiled
gently
and
said
to
the
holy
man
friend
be
comforted
i
am
the
evil
spirit
viii
the
burning
coal
now
brother
giovanni
was
simple
of
heart
and
spirit
and
his
tongue
was
tied
he
knew
not
the
secret
of
speaking
to
his
but
one
day
when
he
was
praying
as
his
habit
was
at
the
foot
of
an
ancient
an
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
to
him
and
saluting
him
said
i
salute
you
because
it
is
i
who
visit
the
and
announce
the
mysteries
to
virgins
and
the
angel
held
in
his
hand
a
burning
coal
this
he
laid
on
the
holy
man
lips
and
spoke
again
and
said
by
virtue
of
this
fire
shall
your
lips
remain
pure
and
they
shall
glow
with
eloquence
i
have
burned
them
and
they
shall
be
burned
your
tongue
shall
be
loosed
and
you
shall
speak
to
your
fellows
for
men
must
hear
the
word
of
life
and
learn
how
they
shall
not
be
saved
but
by
innocency
of
heart
for
this
cause
the
lord
has
unloosed
the
tongue
of
the
simple
and
innocent
then
the
angel
went
back
again
to
heaven
and
the
holy
man
was
seized
with
terror
and
he
prayed
saying
o
god
my
heart
is
so
sore
troubled
i
can
not
find
on
my
lips
the
sweet
savour
of
the
fire
thy
angel
hath
touched
them
with
thou
wouldst
chasten
me
o
lord
seeing
thou
dost
send
me
to
speak
to
the
folk
who
will
not
hearken
to
my
words
i
shall
be
hateful
to
all
men
and
thy
priests
themselves
will
declare
is
a
blasphemer
for
thy
reason
is
contrary
to
the
reason
of
men
nevertheless
thy
will
be
done
then
he
rose
up
from
his
knees
and
set
out
on
his
way
citywards
ix
the
house
of
innocence
on
that
day
fra
giovanni
had
left
the
monastery
at
early
dawn
the
hour
when
the
birds
awake
and
begin
singing
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
city
and
he
thought
within
himself
i
am
going
to
the
city
to
beg
my
bread
and
to
give
bread
to
other
beggars
i
shall
give
away
what
i
receive
and
take
back
what
i
have
given
for
it
is
good
to
ask
and
to
receive
for
the
love
of
god
and
he
who
receives
is
the
brother
of
him
who
gives
and
we
should
not
consider
too
curiously
which
of
the
twain
brothers
we
are
because
truly
the
gift
is
naught
but
everything
is
in
the
gracious
giving
he
that
receives
if
he
have
gracious
charity
is
the
equal
of
him
that
gives
but
he
who
sells
is
the
enemy
of
him
who
buys
and
the
seller
constrains
the
buyer
to
be
his
foe
herein
lies
the
root
of
the
curse
that
poisons
cities
as
the
venom
of
the
serpent
is
in
his
tail
and
it
must
needs
be
a
lady
set
her
foot
on
the
serpent
tail
and
that
lady
is
poverty
already
hath
she
visited
king
louis
of
france
in
his
tower
but
never
yet
entered
among
the
florentines
because
she
is
chaste
and
will
not
put
foot
in
a
place
of
ill
repute
now
the
shop
is
an
ill
place
for
it
is
there
bankers
and
changers
commit
the
most
heinous
of
sins
harlots
sin
in
the
brothels
but
their
sin
is
not
so
great
as
is
that
of
the
bankers
and
whosoever
grows
rich
by
banking
and
verily
i
say
unto
you
bankers
and
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
nor
yet
bakers
nor
dealers
in
drugs
nor
such
as
practise
the
trade
of
wool
which
is
the
boast
of
the
city
of
the
lily
forasmuch
as
they
give
a
price
to
gold
and
make
a
profit
out
of
exchange
they
are
setting
up
idols
in
the
face
of
men
and
when
they
declare
has
a
value
they
tell
a
lie
for
gold
is
more
vile
than
the
dry
leaves
that
flutter
and
rustle
in
the
autumn
wind
under
the
terebinths
there
is
nothing
precious
save
the
work
of
men
hands
when
god
gives
it
his
countenance
and
lo
as
he
was
meditating
in
this
wise
fra
giovanni
saw
that
the
mountain
side
was
torn
open
and
that
men
were
dragging
great
stones
from
its
flank
and
one
of
the
quarrymen
was
lying
by
the
wayside
with
a
rag
of
coarse
cloth
for
all
covering
and
his
body
was
disfigured
by
bitter
marks
of
the
biting
cold
and
scorching
heat
the
bones
of
his
shoulders
and
chest
showed
all
but
bare
beneath
the
meagre
flesh
and
despair
looked
out
grim
and
gaunt
from
the
black
cavern
of
his
eyes
fra
giovanni
approached
him
saying
peace
be
with
you
but
the
quarryman
made
no
answer
and
did
not
so
much
as
turn
his
head
so
fra
giovanni
thinking
he
had
not
heard
repeated
peace
be
with
you
and
then
the
same
words
again
for
the
third
time
at
last
the
quarryman
looked
up
at
him
sullenly
and
growled
i
shall
have
no
peace
till
i
am
dead
begone
cursed
black
crow
you
wish
me
peace
that
shows
you
are
a
glozing
cheat
go
to
and
caw
to
simpler
fools
than
i
i
know
very
well
the
quarryman
lot
is
an
utterly
miserable
one
and
there
is
no
comfort
for
his
wretchedness
i
hale
out
stones
from
dawn
to
dark
and
for
price
of
my
toil
all
i
get
is
a
scrap
of
black
bread
then
when
my
arms
are
no
longer
as
strong
as
the
stones
of
the
mountain
and
my
body
is
all
worn
out
i
shall
perish
of
hunger
brother
said
the
holy
man
giovanni
it
is
not
just
or
right
you
should
hale
out
so
much
stone
and
win
so
little
bread
then
the
quarryman
rose
to
his
feet
and
pointing
master
monk
said
he
what
see
you
up
yonder
on
the
hill
brother
i
see
the
walls
of
the
city
and
above
them
above
them
i
see
the
roofs
of
the
houses
which
crown
the
ramparts
and
higher
still
the
tops
of
the
pines
the
domes
of
the
churches
and
the
belltowers
and
higher
still
i
see
a
tower
overtopping
all
the
rest
and
crowned
with
battlements
it
is
the
tower
of
the
podestà
monk
what
see
you
above
the
battlements
of
that
tower
i
see
nothing
brother
above
the
battlements
save
the
sky
but
i
cried
the
quarryman
i
see
upon
that
tower
a
hideous
giant
brandishing
a
club
and
on
the
club
is
inscribed
oppression
yea
oppression
is
lifted
up
above
the
citizens
heads
on
the
great
tower
of
the
magistrates
and
the
city
laws
and
fra
giovanni
answered
what
one
man
sees
another
can
not
see
and
it
may
be
the
horrid
shape
you
describe
is
set
on
the
tower
of
the
podestà
yonder
in
the
city
of
viterbo
but
is
there
no
remedy
for
the
ills
you
endure
my
brother
the
good
francis
left
behind
him
on
this
earth
so
full
a
fountain
of
consolation
that
all
men
may
draw
refreshment
therefrom
then
the
quarryman
spoke
after
this
fashion
men
have
said
mountain
is
ours
and
these
men
are
my
masters
and
it
is
for
them
i
hew
stone
and
they
enjoy
the
fruit
of
my
labour
fra
giovanni
sighed
surely
men
must
be
mad
to
believe
they
own
a
mountain
but
the
quarryman
replied
nay
they
are
not
mad
and
the
laws
of
the
city
guarantee
them
their
ownership
the
citizens
pay
them
for
the
stones
i
have
hewn
which
are
marbles
of
great
price
and
fra
giovanni
said
we
must
change
the
laws
of
the
city
and
the
habits
of
the
citizens
francis
that
angel
of
god
has
given
the
example
and
shown
the
way
when
he
resolved
by
god
command
to
rebuild
the
ruined
church
of
damian
he
did
not
set
out
to
find
the
master
of
the
quarry
he
did
not
say
buy
me
the
finest
marbles
and
i
will
give
you
gold
in
exchange
for
the
holy
man
who
was
called
the
son
of
bernardone
and
who
was
the
true
son
of
god
knew
this
that
the
man
who
sells
is
the
enemy
of
the
man
who
buys
and
that
the
art
of
trafficking
is
more
mischievous
if
possible
than
the
art
of
war
wherefore
he
did
not
apply
to
the
or
any
of
them
that
give
marble
and
timber
and
lead
in
exchange
for
money
but
he
went
forth
into
the
mountain
and
gathered
his
load
of
wood
and
stones
and
bore
it
himself
to
the
spot
hallowed
to
the
memory
of
the
blessed
damian
with
his
own
hands
by
help
of
the
mason
line
he
laid
the
stones
to
form
the
walls
and
he
made
the
cement
to
bind
together
the
stones
one
to
another
finished
it
was
a
lowly
circuit
of
roughly
fashioned
stones
the
work
of
a
weakling
but
who
considers
it
with
the
eyes
of
the
soul
recognizes
therein
an
angel
thought
for
the
mortar
of
this
wall
was
not
worked
with
the
blood
of
the
unfortunate
this
house
of
damian
was
not
raised
with
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
paid
for
the
blood
of
that
just
man
which
rejected
by
iscariot
go
travelling
the
world
ever
since
passing
from
hand
to
hand
to
buy
up
all
the
injustice
and
all
the
cruelty
of
the
earth
for
alone
of
all
others
this
house
is
founded
on
innocence
stablished
on
love
based
on
charity
and
alone
of
all
others
it
is
the
house
of
god
and
i
tell
you
verily
quarryman
and
brother
the
poor
man
of
jesus
christ
in
doing
these
things
gave
to
the
world
an
example
of
justice
and
one
day
his
foolishness
shall
shine
forth
as
wisdom
for
all
things
in
this
earth
are
god
and
we
are
his
children
and
it
is
meet
the
children
should
share
alike
in
his
inheritance
that
is
each
should
get
what
he
has
need
of
and
seeing
grown
men
do
not
ask
for
broth
nor
babes
for
wine
the
share
of
each
shall
not
be
the
same
but
each
shall
have
the
heritage
that
is
fitting
for
him
and
labour
shall
be
a
joyful
thing
when
it
is
no
longer
paid
is
gold
only
the
cursed
gold
that
makes
the
sharing
uneven
when
each
man
shall
go
severally
to
the
mountain
for
his
stone
and
carry
his
load
to
the
city
on
his
own
back
the
stone
shall
weigh
light
and
it
shall
be
the
stone
of
cheerfulness
and
we
will
build
the
house
of
joy
and
gladness
and
the
new
city
shall
rise
from
its
foundations
and
there
shall
be
neither
rich
nor
poor
but
all
men
will
call
themselves
poor
men
because
they
will
be
glad
to
bear
a
name
that
brings
them
honour
so
spoke
the
gentle
fra
giovanni
and
the
unhappy
quarryman
thought
to
himself
this
man
clad
in
a
shroud
and
girt
with
a
cord
has
proclaimed
new
tidings
i
shall
not
see
the
end
of
my
miseries
for
i
am
going
to
die
of
hunger
and
exhaustion
but
i
shall
die
happy
for
my
eyes
before
they
close
will
have
beheld
the
dawn
of
the
day
of
justice
x
the
friends
of
order
now
in
those
days
there
was
in
the
very
illustrious
city
of
viterbo
a
confraternity
of
sixty
old
men
these
counted
among
their
number
many
of
the
chief
men
of
the
place
and
their
objects
were
the
accumulation
of
honours
and
riches
and
the
pursuit
of
virtue
the
brotherhood
included
a
gonfalonier
of
the
republic
doctors
of
either
faculty
judges
merchants
of
conspicuous
piety
and
one
or
two
old
soldiers
of
fortune
grown
too
ancient
and
feeble
for
the
wars
seeing
they
were
banded
together
for
the
purpose
of
stirring
up
their
to
goodness
and
good
order
and
to
bear
mutual
witness
to
the
practice
of
these
virtues
they
gave
themselves
the
title
of
friends
of
this
name
was
inscribed
on
the
banner
of
the
confraternity
and
they
were
all
of
one
mind
to
persuade
the
poor
to
follow
goodness
and
good
order
to
the
end
no
changes
might
be
made
in
the
constitution
their
habit
was
to
meet
on
the
last
day
of
each
month
in
the
palace
of
the
podestà
to
make
inquiry
of
each
other
what
of
good
had
been
done
in
the
city
during
the
month
and
to
such
of
the
poorer
citizens
as
had
done
well
and
orderly
they
used
to
present
pieces
of
money
now
on
a
certain
day
the
friends
of
order
were
holding
meeting
at
one
end
of
the
hall
was
a
raised
platform
covered
with
velvet
and
over
the
platform
a
magnificent
canopy
of
state
held
up
by
four
figures
carved
and
painted
these
figures
represented
justice
temperance
strength
and
chastity
and
beneath
the
canopy
sat
the
officers
of
the
brotherhood
the
president
who
was
entitled
the
dean
took
his
place
in
the
middle
on
a
golden
chair
which
in
richness
was
scarce
inferior
to
the
throne
that
once
upon
a
time
the
disciple
of
francis
saw
prepared
in
heaven
for
the
poor
man
of
the
lord
this
seat
of
state
had
been
presented
to
the
dean
of
the
brotherhood
to
the
end
that
in
him
should
be
honoured
all
the
goodness
done
in
the
city
and
as
soon
as
the
members
of
the
confraternity
were
ranged
in
the
fitting
order
the
dean
got
up
to
speak
he
congratulated
any
that
served
their
masters
without
receiving
wages
and
spoke
highly
of
the
old
men
who
having
no
bread
to
eat
did
not
ask
for
any
and
he
said
these
have
done
well
and
we
shall
reward
them
for
it
behoves
that
goodness
be
rewarded
and
it
is
our
bounden
duty
to
pay
the
price
of
it
being
as
we
are
the
first
and
foremost
citizens
of
the
city
and
when
he
finished
speaking
the
crowd
of
the
general
folk
that
stood
under
the
platform
clapped
their
hands
but
no
sooner
had
they
done
applauding
than
fra
giovanni
lifted
up
his
voice
from
the
midst
of
the
miserable
band
and
asked
loudly
what
is
goodness
at
this
great
clamour
arose
in
the
assembly
and
the
dean
shouted
who
was
it
spoke
and
a
man
who
was
standing
among
the
people
answered
it
was
a
monk
by
name
giovanni
who
is
the
disgrace
of
his
cloister
he
goes
naked
through
the
streets
carrying
his
clothes
on
his
head
and
gives
himself
up
to
all
sorts
of
extravagances
next
a
baker
spoke
up
and
said
he
is
a
madman
or
a
miscreant
he
begs
his
bread
at
the
bakers
doors
then
a
number
of
those
present
shouting
noisily
and
dragging
fra
giovanni
by
the
gown
tried
to
hustle
him
out
of
the
hall
while
others
more
angry
still
began
throwing
stools
and
breaking
them
over
the
holy
man
head
but
the
dean
rose
from
his
seat
under
the
canopy
and
said
leave
the
man
in
peace
so
that
he
may
hear
me
and
be
confounded
he
asks
what
goodness
is
because
goodness
is
not
in
him
and
he
is
devoid
of
virtue
i
answer
him
knowledge
of
goodness
resides
in
virtuous
men
and
good
citizens
carry
within
them
a
proper
respect
for
the
laws
they
approve
what
has
been
done
in
the
city
to
insure
to
each
man
enjoyment
of
the
riches
he
may
have
acquired
they
support
the
established
order
of
things
and
are
ready
to
fly
to
arms
to
defend
the
same
for
the
duty
of
the
poor
is
to
defend
the
good
things
belonging
to
the
rich
and
this
is
how
the
union
betwixt
citizens
is
maintained
this
is
goodness
and
good
order
again
the
rich
man
has
his
bring
out
a
basket
full
of
bread
which
he
distributes
to
the
poor
and
this
is
goodness
again
these
are
the
lessons
this
rough
ignorant
fellow
required
to
be
taught
having
so
said
the
dean
sat
down
and
the
crowd
of
poor
folks
raised
a
murmur
of
approval
but
fra
giovanni
stepping
on
one
of
the
stools
that
had
been
thrown
at
his
head
with
contumely
and
insult
addressed
them
all
and
said
hear
the
words
of
comfort
goodness
resides
not
in
men
for
men
know
not
of
themselves
what
is
good
they
are
ignorant
of
their
own
nature
and
destiny
what
seems
good
may
be
evil
all
the
while
and
what
is
deemed
useful
harmful
no
man
can
choose
the
things
meet
for
him
because
he
knows
not
his
own
needs
but
is
like
the
little
child
sitting
in
the
meadows
that
sucks
for
wholesome
milk
the
juice
of
the
deadly
nightshade
the
babe
does
not
know
that
the
nightshade
is
a
poison
but
its
mother
knows
this
is
why
goodness
is
to
do
the
will
of
god
it
is
false
to
say
is
i
teach
goodness
and
goodness
is
to
obey
the
city
laws
for
the
laws
are
not
of
god
they
are
of
man
and
share
in
man
craft
and
cunning
and
imperfection
they
are
like
the
rules
children
make
in
the
square
of
viterbo
when
they
are
playing
ball
goodness
is
not
in
customs
nor
in
laws
it
is
in
god
and
in
the
accomplishment
of
god
will
upon
earth
and
it
is
neither
by
nor
magistrates
that
god
will
is
accomplished
upon
the
earth
for
the
great
men
of
this
world
do
their
own
will
and
their
will
is
contrary
to
god
but
they
who
have
stripped
off
pride
and
know
there
is
no
goodness
in
them
these
men
receive
noble
gifts
and
god
himself
distils
his
sweetness
within
them
like
honey
in
the
hollow
of
the
oaks
and
we
must
be
the
full
of
honey
and
dew
humble
ignorant
and
simple
folks
these
have
knowledge
of
god
and
by
them
shall
kingdom
be
stablished
on
earth
salvation
is
not
in
the
strength
of
laws
nor
in
the
multitude
of
soldiers
it
is
in
poverty
and
humbleness
of
spirit
say
not
is
in
me
and
i
teach
goodness
rather
say
is
in
god
on
high
over
long
have
men
hardened
their
hearts
in
their
own
wisdom
over
long
have
they
set
up
the
lion
and
the
above
the
gates
of
their
cities
their
wisdom
and
their
prudence
have
brought
about
slavery
and
wars
and
the
shedding
of
much
innocent
blood
wherefore
you
should
put
your
guidance
in
god
hand
as
the
blind
man
trusts
himself
to
his
dog
guidance
fear
not
to
shut
the
eyes
of
your
spirit
and
have
done
with
reason
for
has
not
reason
made
you
unhappy
and
wicked
by
reason
have
you
grown
like
the
man
who
having
guessed
the
secrets
of
the
beast
crouching
in
the
cavern
waxed
proud
of
his
knowingness
and
deeming
himself
wiser
than
his
fellows
slew
his
father
and
wedded
his
mother
god
was
not
with
him
but
he
is
with
the
humble
and
learn
not
to
will
and
he
will
put
his
will
in
you
seek
not
to
guess
the
riddles
of
the
beast
be
ignorant
and
you
shall
not
fear
to
go
astray
is
only
wise
men
that
are
deceived
fra
giovanni
having
thus
spoken
the
dean
got
up
and
said
the
miscreant
has
insulted
me
and
i
willingly
forgive
him
the
insult
but
he
has
spoken
against
the
laws
of
viterbo
and
it
is
meet
he
should
be
punished
so
fra
giovanni
was
led
before
the
judges
who
had
him
loaded
with
chains
and
cast
him
into
the
city
gaol
xi
the
revolt
of
gentleness
the
holy
man
giovanni
was
chained
to
a
massive
pillar
in
the
middle
of
the
dungeon
over
which
the
river
flowed
two
other
prisoners
were
plunged
along
with
him
in
the
thick
and
fetid
darkness
both
these
had
realized
and
proclaimed
the
injustice
of
the
laws
one
was
for
overthrowing
the
republic
by
force
he
had
been
guilty
of
startling
assassinations
and
his
hope
was
to
purify
the
city
with
fire
and
sword
the
other
trusted
to
be
able
to
change
men
hearts
and
had
delivered
very
persuasive
discourses
inventor
of
wise
laws
he
counted
on
the
charms
of
his
genius
and
the
innocency
of
his
life
to
induce
his
to
submit
to
them
but
both
had
met
with
the
same
doom
when
they
learned
how
the
holy
man
was
chained
alongside
of
them
for
having
spoken
against
the
laws
of
the
city
they
congratulated
him
and
the
one
who
had
invented
wise
laws
said
to
him
if
ever
brother
we
are
restored
to
liberty
seeing
you
think
as
i
do
you
shall
help
me
to
persuade
the
citizens
that
they
ought
to
set
up
above
them
the
empire
of
just
laws
but
the
holy
man
giovanni
answered
him
what
matter
for
justice
being
in
the
laws
if
it
is
not
in
hearts
and
if
men
hearts
are
unjust
what
gain
shall
it
be
that
equity
reign
in
the
courts
of
law
say
not
will
stablish
just
laws
and
we
will
render
to
every
man
what
is
his
due
for
no
one
is
just
and
we
know
not
what
is
meet
for
men
we
are
no
less
ignorant
what
is
good
for
them
and
what
is
evil
and
whensoever
the
princes
of
the
people
and
the
chiefs
of
the
commonwealth
have
loved
justice
they
have
caused
the
slaying
of
many
folk
give
not
the
compass
and
the
level
to
the
false
measurer
for
with
true
instruments
he
will
make
untrue
apportionments
and
he
will
say
i
carry
on
me
the
level
the
rule
and
the
square
and
i
am
a
good
measurer
so
long
as
men
shall
be
covetous
and
cruel
will
they
make
the
most
merciful
laws
cruel
and
will
rob
their
brethren
with
words
of
love
on
their
lips
this
is
why
it
is
vain
to
reveal
to
them
the
words
of
love
and
the
laws
of
gentleness
set
not
up
laws
against
laws
nor
raise
tables
of
marble
and
tables
of
brass
before
men
eyes
for
whatever
is
written
on
the
tables
of
the
law
is
written
in
letters
of
blood
so
spoke
the
holy
man
and
the
other
prisoner
he
who
had
committed
startling
murders
and
contrived
the
ruin
that
was
to
save
the
city
approved
his
words
and
said
comrade
you
have
spoken
well
know
you
i
will
never
set
up
law
against
law
right
rule
against
crooked
rule
my
wish
is
to
destroy
the
law
by
violence
and
compel
the
citizens
to
live
thenceforth
in
happy
freedom
and
know
further
that
i
have
slain
both
judges
and
soldiers
and
have
committed
many
crimes
for
the
public
good
hearing
these
words
the
man
of
the
lord
rose
stretched
out
his
manacled
arms
in
the
heavy
darkness
and
cried
ill
betide
the
violent
for
violence
ever
begets
violence
whosoever
acts
like
you
is
sowing
the
earth
with
hate
and
fury
and
his
children
shall
tear
their
feet
with
the
wayside
briars
and
serpents
shall
bite
their
heel
ill
betide
you
for
you
have
shed
the
blood
of
the
unjust
judge
and
the
brutal
soldier
and
lo
you
are
become
like
the
soldier
and
the
judge
yourself
like
them
you
bear
on
your
hands
the
indelible
stain
a
fool
the
man
who
says
will
do
evildoing
in
our
turn
and
our
heart
shall
be
comforted
we
will
be
unjust
and
it
shall
be
the
beginning
of
justice
evildoing
is
in
evil
desiring
desire
nothing
and
evildoing
will
be
done
away
injustice
hurts
only
the
unjust
i
shall
suffer
no
harm
of
it
if
i
am
just
oppression
is
a
sword
whose
hilt
wounds
the
hand
of
him
who
holds
it
but
its
point
can
not
pierce
the
heart
of
the
man
who
is
and
good
and
kind
for
such
an
one
nothing
is
dangerous
if
he
fear
nothing
to
endure
all
things
is
to
endure
nothing
let
us
be
good
and
kindly
and
the
whole
round
world
shall
be
the
same
for
the
world
will
be
an
instrument
for
your
goodness
and
your
persecutors
will
work
to
make
you
better
and
more
beautiful
you
love
life
and
this
is
an
affection
which
rules
the
heart
of
every
man
then
love
suffering
for
to
live
is
to
suffer
never
envy
your
cruel
masters
rather
have
compassion
for
the
commanders
of
armies
pity
the
publicans
and
judges
the
proudest
of
them
have
known
the
stings
of
grief
and
the
terrors
of
death
happier
you
because
your
consciences
are
void
of
offence
for
you
let
grief
lose
its
bitterness
and
death
its
terrors
be
ye
god
children
and
tell
yourselves
is
well
in
him
beware
of
pursuing
even
the
public
good
with
overmuch
violence
and
avidity
for
fear
something
of
cruelty
mar
your
integrity
rather
should
your
desire
of
universal
have
the
unction
of
a
prayer
and
the
soft
fervour
of
a
hope
fair
the
table
whereat
every
man
shall
get
his
just
portion
and
the
guests
shall
each
one
wash
the
other
feet
but
say
not
will
set
up
this
table
by
force
in
the
streets
of
the
city
and
in
the
public
squares
for
it
is
not
knife
in
hand
you
must
call
together
your
brethren
to
the
feast
of
justice
and
gentleness
of
its
own
accord
must
the
board
be
spread
in
the
campo
di
marte
by
virtue
of
graciousness
and
good
will
this
shall
be
a
miracle
and
be
sure
miracles
are
not
wrought
save
by
faith
and
love
if
you
disobey
your
masters
let
it
be
by
love
neither
fetter
nor
kill
them
but
tell
them
rather
will
never
slay
my
brothers
nor
throw
them
into
chains
endure
suffer
submit
will
what
god
wills
and
your
will
shall
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
what
seems
evil
is
evil
and
what
seems
good
is
good
striving
and
discontent
is
the
true
curse
of
mankind
let
us
then
be
peaceful
and
content
and
never
strike
the
wicked
for
fear
we
make
ourselves
like
them
if
we
have
not
the
good
fortune
to
be
poor
in
very
deed
let
us
not
make
ourselves
rich
men
in
spirit
and
heartbound
to
the
things
of
this
world
that
make
folk
unjust
and
unhappy
let
us
suffer
persecution
with
gentleness
and
be
those
chosen
vessels
that
turn
into
balm
the
gall
poured
into
them
xii
words
of
love
then
the
judges
had
the
holy
man
giovanni
brought
before
them
chained
to
him
who
had
thrown
greek
fire
in
the
palace
of
the
priors
and
they
said
to
the
holy
man
you
are
alongside
of
the
guilty
because
you
are
not
on
our
side
for
whosoever
is
not
with
good
citizens
is
with
evil
and
the
holy
man
answered
them
there
are
neither
good
nor
evil
among
men
but
all
alike
are
unhappy
and
they
who
suffer
neither
hunger
nor
contumely
they
are
afflicted
by
riches
and
power
it
is
not
given
to
any
man
born
of
woman
to
escape
the
miseries
of
life
and
the
son
of
woman
is
like
a
fever
patient
who
turns
and
turns
in
his
bed
and
can
find
no
rest
because
he
will
not
lie
down
on
the
cross
of
jesus
his
head
among
the
thorns
and
take
his
joy
in
suffering
yet
is
it
in
suffering
that
joy
is
found
and
they
who
love
know
this
i
companion
with
love
but
that
man
with
hate
and
for
this
cause
we
can
never
come
together
and
i
say
to
him
you
have
done
ill
and
your
crime
is
great
and
grievous
and
i
speak
so
because
charity
and
love
urge
me
but
you
you
condemn
yonder
guilty
man
in
the
name
of
justice
but
invoking
justice
you
take
a
vain
oath
for
there
is
no
such
thing
as
justice
among
men
we
are
all
of
us
guilty
and
when
you
say
life
of
peoples
is
in
our
hand
you
are
lying
and
you
are
the
coffin
which
declares
am
the
cradle
the
life
of
peoples
is
in
the
harvests
of
the
fields
which
grow
yellow
beneath
the
lord
sight
it
is
in
the
vines
hanging
from
the
elms
and
in
the
smiles
and
tears
wherein
heaven
bathes
the
fruits
of
the
trees
in
the
orchard
closes
it
is
not
in
the
laws
which
are
made
by
the
rich
and
powerful
for
the
maintenance
of
their
own
power
and
riches
ye
forget
how
ye
are
all
born
poor
and
naked
and
he
who
came
to
lie
in
the
manger
at
bethlehem
has
come
without
profiting
you
and
he
must
needs
be
born
again
and
be
crucified
a
second
time
for
your
salvation
the
man
of
violence
has
laid
hold
of
the
arms
you
forged
and
is
well
compared
to
the
warriors
you
hold
in
honour
because
they
have
destroyed
cities
what
is
defended
by
force
shall
be
attacked
by
force
and
if
you
have
wit
to
read
the
book
you
have
written
you
will
find
what
i
say
therein
for
you
have
put
in
your
book
that
the
right
of
nations
is
the
right
of
war
and
you
have
glorified
violence
paying
honours
to
conquering
generals
and
raising
statues
in
your
public
squares
to
them
and
their
and
you
have
laid
it
down
is
violence
that
is
right
and
violence
that
is
wrong
and
this
is
the
right
of
nations
and
this
is
the
law
but
so
soon
as
the
men
shall
have
put
you
outside
the
law
they
will
be
the
law
even
as
you
became
the
law
when
you
had
overthrown
the
tyrant
that
was
the
law
before
you
now
be
assured
it
is
very
certain
that
there
is
no
true
right
save
in
the
renouncing
of
right
there
is
no
hallowed
law
save
in
love
there
is
no
justice
save
in
charity
is
not
by
force
we
should
resist
force
for
strife
only
hardens
the
fighters
hearts
and
the
issue
of
battles
is
aye
dubious
but
if
we
oppose
gentleness
to
violence
this
latter
getting
no
hold
upon
its
adversary
falls
dead
of
itself
it
is
related
by
learned
men
in
the
how
the
unicorn
which
bears
on
its
forehead
a
flaming
sword
transfixes
the
hunter
in
his
but
falls
to
its
knees
before
a
pure
virgin
be
ye
therefore
and
keep
your
heart
pure
and
ye
shall
fear
nothing
put
not
your
trust
in
the
sword
of
the
condottieri
for
did
not
the
shepherd
boy
smooth
stone
pierce
goliath
brow
but
be
ye
strong
in
love
and
love
them
that
hate
you
hate
when
unreturned
is
robbed
of
half
its
sting
and
what
is
left
is
weak
widowed
and
like
to
die
strip
yourselves
that
other
men
strip
you
not
love
your
enemies
that
they
become
your
friends
forgive
that
ye
may
be
forgiven
say
not
is
a
bane
to
the
shepherds
of
the
peoples
for
how
can
you
know
seeing
these
have
never
tried
they
profess
by
harshness
to
have
lessened
the
evil
of
the
world
yet
is
evil
still
rampant
among
men
and
there
is
never
a
sign
of
its
growing
less
i
said
to
some
not
oppressors
and
to
others
not
in
revolt
against
oppression
and
neither
hearkened
to
me
they
cast
the
stone
of
derision
at
me
because
i
was
on
all
men
side
each
reproached
me
and
said
are
not
on
my
side
i
said
am
the
friend
of
the
wretched
but
you
never
thought
i
was
your
friend
because
in
your
pride
you
know
not
that
you
are
wretched
nevertheless
the
wretchedness
of
the
master
is
more
cruel
than
that
of
the
slave
my
tender
pity
for
your
woes
only
made
you
think
i
was
mocking
you
and
the
oppressed
deemed
me
to
be
of
the
party
of
the
oppressors
has
no
bowels
they
said
nay
but
i
am
on
the
side
of
love
and
not
of
hate
this
is
why
you
scorn
me
and
because
i
preach
peace
on
earth
you
hold
me
for
a
fool
you
think
my
words
wander
all
ways
like
the
steps
of
a
drunken
man
and
it
is
very
true
i
walk
your
fields
like
those
harpers
who
on
the
eve
of
battles
come
to
play
before
the
tents
and
the
soldiers
say
as
they
listen
some
poor
simpletons
come
playing
the
tunes
we
heard
long
ago
in
our
mountains
i
am
this
harper
that
roams
between
the
hosts
in
battle
array
of
hostile
armies
when
i
think
whither
human
wisdom
leads
i
am
glad
to
be
a
madman
and
a
simpleton
and
i
thank
god
that
he
has
given
me
the
harp
to
handle
and
not
the
sword
xiii
the
truth
the
holy
man
giovanni
was
very
straitly
confined
in
gaol
where
he
was
fastened
by
chains
to
rings
built
into
the
wall
but
his
soul
was
unfettered
and
no
tortures
had
been
able
to
shake
his
firmness
he
promised
himself
he
would
never
betray
the
faith
that
was
in
him
and
was
ready
to
be
witness
and
martyr
of
the
truth
to
the
end
he
might
die
in
god
and
he
said
to
himself
truth
shall
go
along
with
me
to
the
scaffold
she
shall
look
at
me
and
weep
and
say
tears
flow
seeing
it
is
for
my
sake
this
man
is
going
to
his
death
and
as
the
holy
man
was
thus
holding
colloquy
of
his
own
thoughts
in
the
solitude
of
his
dungeon
a
knight
entered
into
the
prison
without
ever
the
doors
having
been
opened
he
was
clad
in
a
red
mantle
and
carried
in
his
hand
a
lighted
lantern
fra
giovanni
accosted
him
and
said
what
is
your
name
subtle
sir
that
slips
through
prison
walls
and
the
knight
made
answer
brother
what
use
to
tell
you
the
names
folk
give
me
for
you
i
will
bear
the
one
you
shall
call
me
by
know
this
i
am
come
to
you
full
of
helpfulness
and
goodwill
and
being
informed
you
dearly
love
the
truth
i
bring
you
a
word
touching
this
same
truth
that
you
have
taken
for
lady
and
companion
and
fra
giovanni
began
to
tender
thanks
to
his
visitor
but
the
knight
stopped
him
in
the
midst
saying
i
warn
you
this
word
of
mine
will
seem
to
you
at
the
first
empty
and
of
no
account
for
it
is
with
it
as
with
a
tiny
key
that
the
heedless
man
throws
away
without
using
but
the
careful
householder
tries
it
in
lock
after
lock
till
he
finds
at
last
it
opens
a
chest
full
of
gold
and
precious
stones
wherefore
i
say
to
you
fra
giovanni
seeing
you
have
chosen
peradventure
to
take
truth
for
your
lady
and
darling
it
behoves
you
greatly
to
know
concerning
her
all
that
may
be
known
well
then
know
that
she
is
and
from
her
appearance
which
i
will
describe
you
you
shall
gather
her
nature
which
will
be
very
useful
to
you
in
making
up
to
her
and
kissing
her
fair
body
with
all
sorts
of
pretty
caresses
after
the
fashion
of
a
lover
fondling
his
mistress
therefore
take
it
as
proven
brother
mine
that
she
is
after
hearkening
to
these
words
the
holy
man
giovanni
answered
subtle
sir
the
meaning
of
your
discourse
is
not
so
hard
to
guess
as
you
would
seem
to
fear
and
my
wit
albeit
naturally
thick
and
dull
was
instantly
transfixed
by
the
fine
point
of
your
allegory
you
say
that
truth
is
white
to
manifest
the
perfect
purity
that
is
in
her
and
show
clearly
she
is
a
lady
of
immaculate
virtue
and
truly
i
picture
her
to
myself
such
as
you
describe
overpassing
in
whiteness
the
lilies
of
the
garden
and
the
snow
that
in
winter
clothes
the
summits
of
monte
alverno
but
the
visitor
shook
his
head
and
said
nay
fra
giovanni
that
is
not
the
meaning
of
my
words
and
you
have
in
no
wise
broken
the
bone
to
extract
the
marrow
i
instructed
you
that
truth
is
white
that
she
is
pure
and
it
shows
little
discernment
to
think
that
she
is
pure
grieved
at
what
he
now
heard
the
holy
man
giovanni
replied
even
as
the
moon
when
the
earth
hides
the
sun
light
from
her
is
darkened
by
the
thick
shadow
of
this
world
where
was
wrought
the
crime
of
our
mother
eve
so
most
subtle
sir
you
have
obscured
a
plain
saying
under
baffling
phrases
thus
we
have
you
astray
in
the
dark
for
indeed
truth
is
pure
coming
from
god
the
fountain
of
all
purity
but
the
opponent
retorted
fra
giovanni
your
logic
is
at
fault
or
you
would
know
that
purity
is
an
inconceivable
quality
this
is
what
the
shepherds
of
arcady
did
so
they
say
who
named
pure
gods
the
gods
they
knew
not
the
nature
of
then
the
good
fra
giovanni
sighed
and
said
sir
your
words
are
dark
and
wrapped
in
sadness
at
times
in
my
sleep
angels
have
visited
me
their
words
i
could
not
comprehend
but
the
mystery
of
thought
was
full
of
joy
hereupon
the
subtle
visitor
resumed
come
fra
giovanni
let
us
argue
it
out
both
of
us
according
to
the
rules
of
syllogism
but
the
holy
man
answered
nay
i
can
not
argue
with
you
i
have
neither
wish
nor
wit
for
the
task
well
then
returned
the
subtle
sophist
i
must
needs
find
another
opponent
and
in
a
moment
lifting
the
index
finger
of
his
left
hand
he
made
with
his
right
out
of
a
corner
of
his
gown
a
red
cap
for
this
finger
then
holding
it
up
before
his
nose
look
he
said
look
at
this
finger
he
a
learned
doctor
now
and
i
am
going
to
hold
a
learned
argument
with
him
he
a
platonist
maybe
plato
himself
messer
plato
what
is
purity
i
wait
your
answer
messer
plato
oh
you
say
consciousness
is
pure
consciousness
only
when
it
is
devoid
of
everything
which
may
be
seen
heard
handled
in
one
word
proved
by
the
senses
you
grant
me
further
yes
you
nod
your
cap
that
truth
will
be
pure
truth
under
the
same
conditions
that
is
to
say
provided
only
you
make
her
dumb
blind
deaf
legless
paralytic
crippled
of
all
her
limbs
and
i
am
quite
ready
to
allow
that
in
this
state
she
will
escape
the
delusions
that
make
mock
of
mankind
and
will
have
no
temptations
to
play
the
runagate
you
are
a
scoffer
and
you
have
made
much
mock
at
the
world
doff
your
cap
and
the
opponent
dropping
the
corner
of
his
gown
once
more
addressed
the
holy
man
giovanni
my
friend
these
old
sophists
knew
not
what
truth
was
but
i
who
am
a
student
of
physics
and
a
great
observer
of
natural
curiosities
you
may
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
she
is
white
or
more
strictly
speaking
whiteness
itself
from
which
we
must
not
conclude
i
have
told
you
before
that
she
is
pure
consider
the
lady
eletta
of
verona
whose
thighs
were
like
milk
think
you
for
this
they
were
abstract
from
the
world
in
general
withdrawn
in
the
invisible
and
intangible
which
is
the
pure
according
to
the
platonic
doctrine
you
would
be
much
mistaken
if
you
supposed
so
i
do
not
know
this
lady
eletta
you
speak
of
said
the
holy
man
giovanni
she
gave
herself
and
her
living
body
said
the
opponent
to
two
popes
sixty
cardinals
fourteen
princes
eighteen
merchants
the
queen
of
cyprus
three
turks
four
jews
the
lord
bishop
of
arezzo
ape
a
hermaphrodite
and
the
devil
but
we
are
wandering
from
our
subject
which
is
to
discover
the
proper
character
of
truth
now
if
this
character
is
not
purity
as
i
have
just
established
it
can
not
be
in
argument
with
plato
himself
it
is
conceivable
it
may
be
impurity
which
impurity
is
the
necessary
condition
of
all
existing
things
for
have
we
not
just
seen
how
the
pure
has
neither
life
nor
consciousness
and
you
must
yourself
i
trow
have
learned
amply
from
experience
that
life
and
all
pertaining
thereto
is
invariably
compound
blended
diversified
liable
to
increase
and
decrease
unstable
soluble
corruptible
never
pure
doctor
replied
giovanni
your
reasons
are
nothing
worth
forasmuch
as
god
who
is
all
pure
exists
but
the
subtle
doctor
retorted
if
you
would
read
your
books
more
carefully
my
son
you
would
see
it
is
said
of
him
you
have
just
named
exists
but
is
now
to
exist
and
to
be
are
not
one
and
the
same
thing
but
two
opposite
things
you
are
alive
and
do
you
not
say
yourself
am
nothing
i
am
as
if
i
were
not
and
you
do
not
say
am
he
who
is
because
to
live
is
each
moment
to
cease
to
be
again
you
say
am
full
of
impurities
forasmuch
you
are
not
a
single
thing
but
a
blending
of
things
that
stir
and
strive
now
do
you
speak
wisely
answered
the
holy
man
and
i
see
by
your
discourse
that
you
are
very
deep
read
subtle
sir
in
the
sciences
divine
as
well
as
human
for
true
indeed
it
is
god
is
he
who
is
by
the
body
of
bacchus
exclaimed
the
other
he
is
and
that
perfectly
and
universally
wherefore
are
we
dispensed
from
seeking
him
in
any
single
place
being
assured
he
is
to
be
discovered
neither
more
nor
less
in
any
one
spot
than
in
any
other
and
that
you
can
not
find
so
much
as
a
pair
of
old
spatterdashes
without
their
due
share
of
him
admirably
put
and
most
true
returned
giovanni
but
it
is
right
to
add
that
he
is
more
particularly
in
the
sacred
elements
by
the
way
of
transubstantiation
more
than
that
added
the
learned
doctor
he
is
actually
edible
in
them
note
moreover
my
son
that
he
is
round
in
an
apple
in
an
aubergine
sharp
in
a
knife
and
musical
in
a
flute
he
has
all
the
qualities
of
substances
and
likewise
all
the
properties
of
figures
he
is
acute
and
he
is
obtuse
because
he
is
at
one
and
the
same
time
all
possible
triangles
his
radii
are
at
once
equal
and
unequal
because
he
is
both
the
circle
and
the
ellipse
and
he
is
the
hyperbola
besides
which
is
an
indescribable
figure
while
the
holy
giovanni
was
still
pondering
these
sublime
verities
he
heard
the
subtle
doctor
suddenly
burst
out
then
he
asked
him
why
do
you
laugh
i
am
laughing
replied
the
doctor
to
think
how
they
have
discovered
in
me
certain
oppositions
and
contradictions
and
have
reproached
me
bitterly
for
the
same
it
is
very
true
i
have
many
such
but
they
fail
to
see
that
if
i
had
them
all
i
should
then
be
like
the
other
the
holy
man
asked
him
what
other
is
it
you
speak
of
and
the
adversary
answered
if
you
knew
of
whom
i
speak
you
would
know
who
i
am
and
my
wisest
words
you
would
be
loath
to
listen
to
for
much
ill
has
been
said
of
me
but
if
you
remain
ignorant
who
i
am
i
can
be
of
much
use
to
you
i
will
teach
you
how
intensely
sensitive
men
are
to
the
sounds
that
the
lips
utter
and
how
they
let
themselves
be
killed
for
the
sake
of
words
that
are
devoid
of
meaning
this
we
see
with
the
martyrs
and
in
your
own
case
giovanni
who
look
forward
with
joy
to
be
strangled
and
then
burned
to
the
singing
of
the
seven
psalms
in
the
great
square
of
viterbo
for
this
word
for
which
you
could
not
by
any
possibility
discover
a
reasonable
interpretation
verily
you
might
ransack
every
hole
and
corner
of
your
dim
brain
and
pick
over
all
the
spiders
webs
and
old
iron
that
cumber
your
head
without
ever
lighting
on
a
picklock
to
open
this
word
and
extract
the
meaning
but
for
me
my
poor
friend
you
would
get
yourself
hanged
and
your
body
burned
for
a
word
of
one
syllable
which
neither
you
nor
your
judges
know
the
sense
of
so
that
none
could
ever
have
discovered
which
to
despise
the
most
hangmen
or
hanged
know
then
that
truth
your
mistress
is
made
up
of
elements
compacted
of
wet
and
dry
hard
and
soft
cold
and
hot
and
that
it
is
with
this
lady
as
with
women
of
common
humanity
in
whom
soft
flesh
and
warm
blood
are
not
diffused
equally
in
all
the
body
fra
giovanni
doubted
in
his
simplicity
whether
this
discourse
was
altogether
becoming
the
adversary
read
the
holy
man
thought
and
reassured
him
saying
such
is
the
learning
we
are
taught
at
school
i
am
a
theologian
i
then
he
got
up
and
added
i
regret
to
leave
you
friend
but
i
can
not
tarry
longer
with
you
for
i
have
many
contradictions
to
pose
to
many
men
i
can
taste
no
rest
day
nor
night
but
i
must
be
going
ceaselessly
from
place
to
place
setting
down
my
lantern
now
on
the
scholar
desk
now
at
the
bed
head
of
the
sick
man
who
can
not
sleep
so
saying
he
went
away
as
he
had
come
and
the
holy
man
giovanni
asked
himself
why
did
this
doctor
say
truth
was
white
i
wonder
and
lying
in
the
straw
he
kept
revolving
this
question
in
his
head
his
body
shared
the
restlessness
of
his
mind
and
kept
turning
first
one
side
then
the
other
in
search
of
the
repose
he
could
not
find
xiv
giovanni
dream
and
this
is
why
left
alone
in
his
dungeon
he
prayed
to
the
lord
saying
o
lord
thy
is
infinite
toward
me
and
thy
favour
manifest
seeing
thou
hast
so
willed
i
should
lie
on
a
dunghill
like
job
and
lazarus
whom
thou
didst
love
so
well
and
thou
hast
given
me
to
know
how
filthy
straw
is
a
soft
and
sweet
pillow
to
the
just
man
and
thou
dear
son
of
god
who
didst
descend
into
hell
bless
thou
the
sleep
of
thy
servant
where
he
lies
in
the
gloomy
forasmuch
as
men
have
robbed
me
of
air
and
light
because
i
was
steadfast
to
confess
the
truth
deign
to
enlighten
me
with
the
glory
of
the
everlasting
dayspring
and
feed
me
on
the
flames
of
thy
love
o
living
truth
o
lord
my
god
thus
prayed
the
holy
man
giovanni
with
his
lips
but
in
his
heart
he
remembered
the
sayings
of
the
adversary
he
was
troubled
to
the
bottom
of
his
spirit
and
in
much
trouble
and
anguish
of
mind
he
fell
asleep
and
seeing
the
thought
of
the
adversary
weighed
heavy
on
his
slumbers
his
sleep
was
not
like
the
little
child
lying
on
its
mother
breast
a
gentle
sleep
of
smiles
and
milk
and
in
his
dreams
he
beheld
a
vast
wheel
that
shone
with
colours
of
living
fire
it
was
like
those
rose
windows
of
brilliancy
that
glow
over
the
doors
of
churches
the
masterpieces
of
gothic
craftsmen
and
display
in
the
translucent
glass
the
history
of
the
virgin
mary
and
the
glory
of
the
prophets
but
the
secret
of
these
rose
windows
is
unknown
to
the
tuscan
artificer
and
this
wheel
was
great
and
dazzling
and
brighter
a
thousandfold
than
the
best
wrought
of
all
the
rose
windows
that
ever
were
divided
by
compass
and
painted
with
brush
in
the
lands
of
the
north
the
emperor
charlemagne
saw
not
the
like
the
day
he
was
crowned
the
only
man
who
ever
beheld
a
wheel
more
splendid
was
the
poet
who
a
lady
leading
him
entered
clothed
in
flesh
into
holy
paradise
the
rose
was
of
living
light
and
seemed
alive
itself
every
age
and
every
condition
in
an
eager
crowd
formed
the
nave
and
spokes
and
felloe
they
were
clad
each
according
to
his
estate
and
it
was
easy
to
recognize
pope
and
emperor
kings
and
queens
bishops
barons
knights
ladies
esquires
clerks
burghers
merchants
attorneys
apothecaries
labourers
ruffians
moors
and
jews
moreover
seeing
all
that
live
on
this
earth
were
shown
on
the
wheel
satyrs
and
cyclopes
were
there
and
pygmies
and
centaurs
such
as
africa
nurses
in
her
burning
deserts
and
the
men
marco
polo
the
traveller
found
who
are
born
without
heads
and
with
a
face
below
their
navel
and
from
betwixt
the
lips
of
each
there
issued
a
scroll
bearing
a
device
now
each
device
was
of
a
hue
which
did
not
appear
in
any
other
and
in
all
the
incalculable
multitude
of
devices
no
two
could
have
been
discovered
of
the
same
appearance
some
were
dyed
purple
others
painted
with
the
bright
colours
of
the
sky
and
sea
or
the
shining
of
the
stars
yet
others
green
as
grass
many
were
exceeding
pale
many
again
exceeding
dark
and
sombre
the
whole
so
ordered
that
the
eye
found
in
these
devices
every
one
of
the
colours
that
paint
the
universe
the
holy
man
giovanni
began
to
decipher
them
by
this
means
making
himself
acquainted
with
the
divers
thoughts
of
divers
men
and
after
reading
on
a
good
while
he
perceived
that
these
devices
were
as
much
diversified
in
the
sense
of
the
words
as
in
the
hues
of
the
letters
and
that
the
sentences
differed
one
from
the
other
in
such
sort
that
there
was
never
a
single
one
did
not
flatly
contradict
every
other
but
at
the
same
time
he
noted
that
this
contradiction
which
existed
in
the
head
and
body
of
the
maxims
did
not
continue
in
their
tail
but
that
they
all
agreed
together
very
accurately
in
their
lower
extremity
all
ending
in
the
same
fashion
seeing
each
and
all
terminated
in
these
words
is
and
he
said
in
his
heart
these
mottoes
are
like
the
flowers
young
men
and
maidens
pluck
in
the
by
the
arno
to
make
them
into
posies
for
these
flowers
are
readily
gathered
together
by
the
tails
while
the
heads
keep
separate
and
fight
amongst
themselves
in
hue
and
brilliancy
and
it
is
the
same
with
the
opinions
of
human
beings
and
the
holy
man
found
in
the
devices
a
host
of
contradictions
regarding
the
origin
of
sovereignty
the
fountains
of
knowledge
pleasure
and
pain
things
lawful
and
things
unlawful
and
he
discovered
likewise
mighty
difficulties
in
connection
with
the
shape
of
the
earth
and
the
divinity
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
by
reason
of
the
heretics
and
arabs
and
jews
the
monsters
of
the
african
desert
and
the
epicureans
who
all
had
their
place
a
scroll
in
their
lips
on
the
wheel
of
fire
and
each
sentence
ended
in
this
way
is
and
the
holy
man
giovanni
marvelled
to
see
so
many
truths
all
diversely
coloured
he
saw
red
and
blue
and
green
and
yellow
but
he
saw
no
white
not
even
the
one
the
pope
made
proclamation
of
to
wit
on
this
rock
have
i
built
my
church
and
committed
thereto
the
crowns
of
all
the
world
indeed
this
device
was
all
red
and
as
if
and
the
holy
man
sighed
then
i
am
never
to
find
on
the
wheel
of
the
universe
the
pure
white
truth
the
immaculate
and
candid
truth
i
would
find
and
he
called
upon
truth
crying
with
tears
in
his
eyes
truth
truth
for
whose
sake
i
am
to
die
show
yourself
before
your
martyr
eyes
and
lo
as
he
was
wailing
out
the
words
the
living
wheel
began
to
revolve
and
the
devices
running
one
into
the
other
no
longer
kept
distinct
while
on
the
great
disk
came
circles
of
every
hue
circles
wider
and
wider
the
further
they
were
from
the
centre
then
as
the
motion
grew
faster
these
circles
disappeared
one
by
one
the
widest
vanished
first
because
the
speed
was
swiftest
near
the
felloe
of
the
wheel
but
directly
the
wheel
began
to
spin
so
fast
the
eye
could
not
see
it
move
and
it
seemed
to
stand
motionless
the
smallest
circles
too
disappeared
like
the
when
the
sun
pales
the
hills
of
assisi
then
at
the
last
the
wheel
looked
all
white
and
it
overpassed
in
brilliance
the
translucent
orb
where
the
florentine
poet
saw
beatrice
in
the
dewdrop
it
seemed
as
though
an
angel
wiping
the
eternal
pearl
to
cleanse
it
of
all
stains
had
set
it
on
the
earth
so
like
was
the
wheel
to
the
moon
when
she
shines
high
in
the
heavens
lightly
veiled
under
the
gauze
of
filmy
clouds
for
at
these
times
no
shadow
of
a
man
carrying
sticks
no
mark
at
all
shows
on
her
opalescent
surface
even
so
never
a
stain
was
visible
on
the
wheel
of
light
and
the
holy
man
giovanni
heard
a
voice
which
said
to
him
behold
that
same
white
truth
you
were
fain
to
contemplate
and
know
it
is
built
up
of
the
divers
contradictory
truths
in
the
same
fashion
as
all
colours
go
to
make
up
white
the
little
children
of
viterbo
know
this
for
having
spun
their
tops
striped
with
many
colours
on
the
flags
on
the
great
market
but
the
doctors
of
bologna
never
guessed
the
reasons
for
this
appearance
now
in
every
one
of
the
devices
was
a
portion
of
the
truth
and
all
together
make
up
the
true
and
veritable
device
alas
and
alas
replied
the
holy
man
how
am
i
to
read
it
for
my
eyes
are
dazzled
and
the
voice
answered
very
true
there
is
naught
to
be
seen
there
but
flashing
fire
no
latin
letters
nor
arabic
nor
greek
no
cabalistic
signs
can
ever
express
this
device
and
no
hand
is
there
may
trace
it
in
characters
of
flame
on
palace
walls
friend
never
set
your
heart
on
reading
what
is
not
written
only
know
this
that
whatsoever
a
man
has
thought
or
believed
in
his
brief
lifetime
is
a
parcel
of
this
infinite
truth
and
that
even
as
much
dirt
and
disorder
enter
into
what
we
call
the
order
of
nature
that
is
the
clean
and
proper
ordering
of
the
universe
so
the
maxims
of
knaves
and
fools
who
make
the
mass
of
mankind
participate
in
some
sort
in
that
general
and
universal
is
absolute
everlasting
and
divine
which
makes
me
sore
afraid
by
the
by
it
may
very
like
not
exist
at
all
and
with
a
great
burst
of
mocking
laughter
the
voice
fell
silent
then
the
holy
man
saw
a
long
leg
stretched
out
in
red
hose
and
inside
the
shoe
the
foot
seemed
cloven
and
like
a
goat
only
much
larger
and
it
gave
the
wheel
of
light
so
shrewd
a
kick
on
the
rim
of
its
felloe
that
sparks
flew
out
as
they
do
when
the
blacksmith
smites
the
iron
with
his
hammer
and
the
great
wheel
leapt
into
the
air
to
fall
far
away
broken
into
fragments
meantime
the
air
was
filled
with
such
piercing
laughter
that
the
holy
man
awoke
and
in
the
livid
gloom
of
the
dungeon
he
thought
sadly
i
have
no
hope
or
wish
left
to
know
truth
if
as
has
just
been
manifested
to
me
she
only
shows
herself
in
contradictions
and
inconsistencies
how
shall
i
dare
by
my
death
to
be
witness
and
martyr
of
what
men
must
believe
now
the
vision
of
the
wheel
of
the
universe
has
made
me
see
how
every
particular
falsehood
is
a
parcel
of
general
truth
absolute
and
unknowable
why
o
my
god
have
you
suffered
me
to
behold
these
things
and
let
it
be
revealed
to
me
before
my
last
sleep
that
truth
is
everywhere
and
that
she
is
nowhere
and
the
holy
man
laid
his
head
in
his
hands
and
wept
xv
the
judgment
fra
giovanni
was
led
before
the
magistrates
of
the
republic
to
be
judged
according
to
the
laws
of
viterbo
and
one
of
the
magistrates
said
to
the
guards
take
his
chains
off
him
for
every
person
accused
should
appear
freely
before
us
and
giovanni
thought
why
does
the
judge
pronounce
words
that
are
not
straight
and
the
first
of
the
magistrates
began
to
question
the
holy
man
and
said
to
him
giovanni
bad
man
that
you
are
being
thrown
in
prison
by
the
august
clemency
of
the
laws
you
have
spoken
against
those
laws
you
have
contrived
with
wicked
men
chained
in
the
same
dungeon
as
yourself
a
plot
to
overthrow
the
order
stablished
in
this
city
the
holy
man
giovanni
made
answer
nay
i
but
spoke
for
justice
and
truth
if
the
laws
of
the
city
are
agreeable
to
justice
and
truth
i
have
not
spoken
against
them
i
have
only
spoken
words
of
i
said
not
to
destroy
force
by
force
be
peaceable
in
the
midst
of
wars
to
the
end
the
spirit
of
god
may
rest
on
you
like
a
little
bird
on
the
top
of
a
poplar
in
the
valley
that
is
flooded
by
the
torrent
i
said
gentle
toward
the
men
of
violence
then
the
judge
cried
out
in
anger
speak
tell
us
who
are
the
men
of
violence
but
the
holy
man
said
you
are
for
milking
the
cow
that
has
given
all
her
milk
and
would
learn
of
me
more
than
i
know
however
the
judge
imposed
silence
on
the
holy
man
and
he
said
your
tongue
has
discharged
the
arrow
of
your
discourse
and
its
shot
was
aimed
at
the
republic
only
it
has
lighted
lower
and
turned
back
upon
yourself
and
the
holy
man
said
you
judge
me
not
by
my
acts
and
my
words
which
are
manifest
but
by
my
motives
which
are
visible
only
to
god
eye
and
the
judge
replied
nay
if
we
could
not
see
the
invisible
and
were
not
gods
upon
earth
how
would
it
be
possible
for
us
to
judge
folk
do
you
not
know
a
law
has
just
been
passed
in
viterbo
which
punishes
even
men
secret
thoughts
for
the
police
of
cities
is
for
ever
being
perfected
and
the
wise
ulpian
who
held
the
rule
and
the
square
in
the
days
of
cæsar
would
be
astonished
himself
if
he
could
see
our
rules
and
squares
improved
as
they
are
and
the
judge
said
again
giovanni
you
have
been
conspiring
in
your
prison
against
the
common
weal
but
the
holy
man
denied
having
ever
conspired
against
the
weal
of
viterbo
then
the
judge
said
the
gaoler
has
given
testimony
against
you
and
the
holy
man
asked
the
judge
what
weight
will
my
testimony
have
in
one
scale
when
that
of
the
gaoler
is
in
the
other
the
judge
answered
why
yours
will
kick
the
beam
wherefore
the
holy
man
held
his
peace
henceforth
then
the
judge
declared
anon
you
were
talking
and
the
words
you
said
proved
your
perfidy
now
you
say
nothing
and
your
silence
is
the
avowal
of
your
crime
so
you
have
confessed
your
guilt
twice
over
and
the
magistrate
they
entitled
the
accuser
rose
and
said
the
illustrious
city
of
viterbo
speaks
by
my
voice
and
my
voice
shall
be
grave
and
calm
because
it
is
the
public
voice
and
you
will
think
you
are
listening
to
a
bronze
statue
speaking
for
i
make
accusation
not
with
my
heart
and
bowels
but
with
the
tables
of
bronze
whereon
the
law
is
inscribed
and
straightway
he
began
to
gesticulate
furiously
and
utter
a
raging
torrent
of
words
and
he
declaimed
the
argument
of
a
play
in
imitation
of
seneca
the
tragedian
and
this
drama
was
filled
full
of
crimes
committed
by
the
holy
man
giovanni
and
the
accuser
represented
in
succession
all
the
characters
of
the
tragedy
he
mimicked
the
groans
of
the
victims
and
the
voice
of
giovanni
the
better
to
strike
awe
into
his
audience
who
seemed
to
hear
and
see
giovanni
himself
intoxicated
with
hate
and
evildoing
and
the
accuser
tore
his
hair
and
rent
his
gown
and
fell
back
exhausted
on
his
august
seat
of
office
and
the
judge
who
had
questioned
the
accused
before
took
up
the
word
again
and
said
it
is
meet
a
citizen
defend
this
man
for
none
so
says
the
law
of
viterbo
may
be
condemned
without
having
been
first
defended
thereupon
an
advocate
of
viterbo
got
up
on
a
stool
and
spoke
in
these
terms
if
this
monk
has
said
and
done
what
is
laid
to
his
charge
he
is
very
wicked
but
we
have
no
proof
that
he
has
spoken
and
acted
in
the
manner
supposed
moreover
good
sirs
had
we
this
proof
it
would
behove
us
to
consider
further
the
extreme
simplicity
of
the
man
and
the
feebleness
of
his
understanding
he
was
the
of
the
children
in
the
public
square
he
is
ignorant
he
has
done
a
thousand
extravagances
for
my
own
part
i
believe
he
is
beside
himself
what
he
says
is
worthless
nonsense
and
there
is
nothing
sensible
he
can
do
i
think
he
has
been
frequenting
seditious
societies
and
goes
about
repeating
what
he
heard
there
without
understanding
a
word
of
it
he
is
too
to
be
punished
look
out
for
his
instructors
it
is
they
are
to
blame
there
are
many
difficulties
in
the
matter
and
the
wise
man
has
told
us
doubt
refrain
from
action
having
so
said
the
advocate
stepped
down
from
his
stool
and
brother
giovanni
received
his
death
sentence
and
he
was
informed
he
was
to
be
hanged
in
the
square
where
the
peasant
women
come
to
sell
fruit
and
vegetables
and
the
children
to
play
knucklebones
next
a
very
illustrious
doctor
of
law
who
was
one
of
the
judges
got
up
and
said
giovanni
it
behoves
you
to
subscribe
consent
to
the
sentence
condemning
you
for
being
pronounced
in
the
name
of
the
city
it
is
pronounced
by
yourself
inasmuch
as
you
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
city
you
have
an
honourable
part
in
it
as
citizen
and
i
will
convince
you
that
you
ought
to
be
well
content
to
be
strangled
by
the
judgment
know
this
the
satisfaction
of
the
whole
comprehends
and
embraces
the
satisfaction
of
the
parts
and
seeing
you
are
a
part
a
vile
and
miserable
part
yet
still
a
part
of
the
noble
city
of
viterbo
your
condemnation
which
satisfies
the
community
should
be
no
less
satisfactory
to
yourself
and
i
will
further
prove
you
that
you
should
rightly
consider
death
doom
agreeable
and
fitting
for
there
is
no
other
thing
so
useful
and
becoming
as
is
the
law
which
is
the
just
measure
of
things
and
you
ought
to
be
pleased
to
have
received
this
same
just
and
proper
measure
in
accordance
with
the
rules
stablished
by
cæsar
justinian
you
have
got
your
due
your
condemnation
is
just
and
therefore
a
pleasant
and
a
good
thing
but
were
it
unjust
and
tainted
and
contaminated
with
ignorance
and
iniquity
which
god
forbid
still
it
would
be
incumbent
on
you
to
approve
the
same
for
an
unjust
sentence
when
it
is
pronounced
in
the
prescribed
forms
of
law
participates
in
the
virtue
of
the
said
forms
and
through
them
continues
august
efficacious
and
of
high
merit
what
it
contains
of
wrong
is
temporary
and
of
little
consequence
and
concerns
only
the
particular
instance
whereas
the
good
in
it
derives
from
the
fixity
and
permanence
of
the
organization
of
the
laws
and
therefore
is
it
agreeable
to
the
general
dictates
of
justice
wherefore
papinian
declares
it
is
better
to
give
false
judgment
than
none
at
all
seeing
how
men
without
justice
are
no
better
than
wild
beasts
in
the
woods
whereas
by
justice
is
made
manifest
their
nobleness
and
dignity
as
is
seen
by
the
example
of
the
judges
of
the
areopagus
who
were
held
in
special
honour
among
the
athenians
so
seeing
it
is
necessary
and
profitable
to
give
judgment
and
that
it
is
not
possible
to
do
so
without
fault
or
mistake
it
follows
that
mistake
and
faultiness
are
comprised
in
the
excellence
of
justice
and
participate
in
the
said
excellence
accordingly
supposing
you
deemed
your
sentence
unfair
you
should
find
satisfaction
in
this
unfairness
inasmuch
as
it
is
united
and
amalgamated
with
fairness
just
as
tin
and
copper
are
fused
together
to
make
bronze
which
is
a
precious
metal
and
employed
for
very
noble
purposes
in
the
fashion
pliny
describes
in
his
histories
the
learned
doctor
then
proceeded
to
enumerate
the
conveniencies
and
advantages
which
flow
from
expiation
and
wash
away
sin
as
the
maids
every
saturday
wash
the
courtyards
of
their
masters
houses
and
he
demonstrated
to
the
holy
man
what
a
boon
it
was
for
him
to
be
condemned
to
death
by
the
august
good
pleasure
of
the
commonwealth
of
viterbo
which
had
granted
him
judges
and
a
defender
and
so
soon
as
the
eloquence
was
exhausted
and
he
fell
silent
fra
giovanni
was
fettered
once
more
and
led
back
to
prison
xvi
the
prince
of
this
world
now
on
the
morning
appointed
for
his
hanging
the
holy
man
giovanni
was
lying
sound
asleep
and
the
subtle
doctor
came
and
opened
the
door
of
his
prison
cell
and
pulling
him
by
the
sleeve
cried
ho
there
son
of
woman
awake
the
day
is
just
unclosing
his
grey
eyes
the
lark
is
singing
and
the
morning
mists
kissing
the
mountain
sides
clouds
glide
along
the
hills
soft
and
sinuous
with
rosy
reflexions
which
are
the
flanks
and
bosoms
and
loins
of
immortal
nymphs
divine
daughters
of
the
rivers
and
the
sky
maidens
of
the
morn
old
oceanus
leads
forth
along
the
heights
a
flock
multiform
as
his
waves
and
who
welcome
to
their
cool
fresh
arms
on
a
couch
of
hyacinths
and
anemones
the
gods
masters
of
the
world
and
the
shepherd
swains
loved
of
goddesses
for
there
are
shepherds
their
mothers
bore
beautiful
and
worthy
the
bed
of
the
nymphs
that
dwell
in
the
and
woodlands
and
for
myself
who
have
deeply
studied
the
secrets
of
nature
seeing
but
now
these
clouds
curling
wantonly
round
the
bosom
of
the
hill
i
was
filled
with
mysterious
longings
at
the
sight
longings
i
know
nothing
of
but
that
they
spring
from
the
region
of
my
loins
and
that
like
the
infant
hercules
they
showed
their
strength
from
the
very
cradle
and
these
longings
were
not
merely
after
rosy
mists
and
floating
clouds
they
pictured
very
precisely
a
wench
named
monna
libetta
i
made
acquaintance
with
once
in
travelling
at
castro
at
an
inn
where
she
was
and
at
the
free
disposal
of
the
muleteers
and
soldiers
frequenting
it
but
the
picture
i
framed
in
my
mind
of
monna
libetta
this
morning
as
i
fared
along
the
slopes
of
the
hills
was
wondrously
embellished
by
the
tenderness
of
recollection
and
the
regrets
of
separation
and
she
was
tricked
out
with
all
the
pretty
fancies
that
springing
from
the
loins
as
i
said
presently
send
their
fragrant
fire
coursing
through
all
the
body
soul
transfusing
it
with
languishing
ardours
and
pains
that
are
a
delicious
pleasure
for
i
would
have
you
know
my
giovanni
that
looking
at
her
calmly
and
coldly
the
girl
was
not
greatly
different
from
all
the
rest
of
the
country
wenches
that
in
the
plains
of
umbria
and
the
roman
marches
go
afield
to
milk
the
cattle
she
had
dark
eyes
slow
and
sullen
a
sunburnt
face
a
big
mouth
the
bosom
heavy
the
belly
tanned
and
the
forepart
of
the
legs
from
the
knee
shaggy
with
hair
her
laugh
was
ready
and
rude
in
a
general
way
but
in
act
with
a
lover
her
face
grew
dark
and
transfigured
as
if
with
wonder
at
the
presence
of
a
god
was
this
had
attached
me
to
her
and
i
have
many
a
time
pondered
since
on
the
nature
of
this
attachment
for
i
am
learned
and
curious
to
search
out
the
reasons
of
things
and
i
discovered
the
force
that
drew
me
toward
this
girl
monna
libetta
at
the
inn
of
castro
was
the
same
that
governs
the
stars
in
heaven
and
that
there
is
one
force
and
one
only
in
the
world
which
is
love
and
it
is
likewise
hate
as
is
shown
by
the
case
of
this
same
monna
libetta
who
was
fiercely
fondled
and
just
as
fiercely
beaten
and
i
mind
me
how
a
groom
in
the
pope
stables
who
was
her
chief
lover
struck
her
so
savagely
one
night
in
the
where
he
was
bedding
with
her
that
he
left
her
lying
there
for
dead
and
he
rushed
crying
through
the
streets
that
the
vampires
had
strangled
the
girl
these
be
subjects
a
man
must
needs
ponder
if
he
would
gain
some
notion
of
true
physics
and
natural
philosophy
thus
spoke
the
subtle
doctor
and
the
holy
man
giovanni
sitting
up
on
his
bedding
of
dung
answered
nay
doctor
is
this
language
meet
to
address
to
a
man
that
is
to
be
hanged
in
a
very
short
while
hearing
you
i
am
filled
with
doubt
whether
your
words
are
the
words
of
a
good
man
and
a
great
theologian
or
if
they
do
not
rather
come
from
an
evil
dream
sent
by
the
angel
of
darkness
but
the
subtle
doctor
made
answer
who
talks
of
being
hanged
i
tell
you
giovanni
i
am
come
hither
at
the
earliest
peep
of
day
to
set
you
free
and
help
you
to
fly
see
i
have
donned
a
gaoler
habit
the
prison
door
stands
open
quick
up
and
away
at
this
the
holy
man
rose
to
his
feet
and
answered
doctor
take
heed
what
you
are
saying
i
have
made
the
sacrifice
of
my
life
and
i
admit
it
has
cost
me
dear
to
make
it
if
trusting
to
your
word
that
i
am
restored
to
life
i
am
then
led
to
the
place
of
execution
i
must
needs
make
a
second
sacrifice
more
grievous
than
the
first
and
suffer
two
deaths
instead
of
out
and
i
confess
to
you
my
desire
of
martyrdom
is
vanished
away
and
a
longing
come
upon
me
to
breathe
the
air
of
day
under
the
branches
of
the
mountain
pines
the
subtle
doctor
made
reply
it
happens
that
was
just
my
intent
to
lead
you
away
under
the
pines
rustling
in
the
wind
with
the
soft
sighing
of
a
flute
we
will
break
our
fast
sitting
on
the
mossy
slope
overlooking
the
city
come
with
me
why
do
you
tarry
and
the
holy
man
said
before
going
hence
with
you
i
would
fain
know
clearly
who
you
are
i
am
fallen
from
my
first
constancy
my
courage
is
no
better
now
than
a
straw
blown
about
on
the
wasted
of
my
virtue
but
i
am
left
my
faith
in
the
son
of
god
and
to
save
my
body
i
would
ill
like
to
lose
my
soul
verily
cried
the
subtle
doctor
think
you
verily
i
have
any
desire
of
your
soul
is
it
then
so
fair
a
maid
and
sweet
a
lady
you
are
afraid
i
may
rob
you
of
it
nay
keep
it
friend
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
the
holy
man
was
scarce
assured
by
what
he
heard
for
the
other
words
breathed
no
pious
odour
but
as
he
was
exceeding
eager
to
be
free
he
asked
no
more
questions
but
followed
the
doctor
and
passed
the
wicket
of
the
prison
by
his
side
only
when
he
was
without
he
inquired
who
are
you
you
who
send
dreams
to
men
and
set
prisoners
free
you
have
the
beauty
of
a
woman
and
the
strength
of
a
man
and
i
admire
you
though
i
can
not
love
you
and
the
subtle
doctor
answered
you
will
love
me
so
soon
as
i
have
made
you
suffer
men
can
not
love
but
those
who
make
them
suffer
and
there
is
no
love
except
in
pain
and
so
conversing
they
left
the
city
and
began
climbing
the
mountain
paths
and
after
faring
far
they
saw
at
the
entering
in
of
a
wood
a
house
before
which
was
a
wide
terrace
overlooking
the
plain
planted
with
fruit
trees
and
bordered
with
vines
so
they
sat
down
in
the
courtyard
at
the
foot
of
a
vine
trunk
its
leaves
were
gilded
by
the
autumn
and
from
the
boughs
hung
clusters
of
grapes
and
a
girl
brought
them
milk
and
honey
and
cakes
of
maize
presently
the
subtle
doctor
stretching
out
his
arm
plucked
a
apple
bit
into
it
and
gave
it
to
the
holy
man
and
giovanni
ate
and
drank
and
his
beard
was
all
white
with
milk
and
his
eyes
laughed
as
he
gazed
up
at
the
sky
which
filled
them
with
blue
light
and
joy
and
the
girl
smiled
then
the
subtle
doctor
said
look
at
yonder
child
she
is
far
comelier
than
monna
libetta
and
the
holy
man
intoxicated
with
milk
and
honey
and
made
merry
with
the
light
of
day
sang
songs
his
mother
was
used
to
sing
when
she
carried
him
as
a
babe
in
her
arms
they
were
songs
of
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
and
they
spoke
of
love
and
as
the
girl
stood
listening
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
the
holy
man
left
his
seat
and
ran
staggering
towards
her
took
her
in
his
arms
and
showered
on
her
cheeks
kisses
full
of
milk
laughter
and
joy
and
the
subtle
doctor
having
paid
the
reckoning
the
two
travellers
hied
them
toward
the
plain
as
they
were
walking
between
the
silvery
willows
that
border
the
water
the
holy
man
said
let
us
sit
for
now
i
am
weary
so
they
sat
down
beneath
a
willow
and
watched
the
curling
their
leaves
on
the
river
banks
and
the
flies
flashing
over
the
surface
but
giovanni
laughter
was
ceased
and
his
face
was
sad
and
the
subtle
doctor
asked
him
why
are
you
so
pensive
and
giovanni
answered
him
i
have
felt
through
you
the
sweet
caress
of
living
things
and
i
am
troubled
at
heart
i
have
tasted
the
milk
and
the
honey
i
have
looked
on
the
standing
at
the
threshold
and
seen
that
she
was
comely
and
disquietude
is
in
my
soul
and
in
my
flesh
what
a
long
road
i
have
travelled
since
i
have
known
you
do
you
remember
the
grove
of
where
i
saw
you
the
first
time
for
be
sure
i
recognize
you
you
it
was
visited
me
in
my
hermit
cell
and
stood
before
me
with
woman
eyes
sparkling
through
a
transparent
veil
while
your
alluring
mouth
instructed
me
in
the
entanglements
of
right
and
wrong
again
it
was
you
appeared
in
the
meadows
clad
in
a
golden
cope
like
an
ambrose
or
an
augustine
then
i
knew
not
the
curse
of
thought
but
you
set
me
thinking
you
put
pride
like
a
coal
of
fire
on
my
lips
and
i
learned
to
speculate
but
as
yet
in
the
untrained
freshness
of
my
wit
and
raw
youthfulness
of
mind
i
felt
no
doubt
but
again
you
came
to
me
and
gave
me
uncertainty
to
feed
on
and
doubt
to
drink
like
wine
so
comes
it
that
this
day
i
taste
through
you
the
entrancing
illusion
of
things
and
that
the
soul
of
woods
and
streams
of
sky
and
earth
and
living
shapes
penetrates
my
breast
and
lo
i
am
a
miserable
man
because
i
have
followed
after
you
prince
of
men
and
giovanni
gazed
at
his
companion
who
stood
there
beautiful
as
day
and
night
and
he
said
to
him
through
you
it
is
i
suffer
and
i
love
you
i
love
you
because
you
are
my
misery
and
my
pride
my
joy
and
my
sorrow
the
splendour
and
the
cruelty
of
things
created
because
you
are
desire
and
speculation
and
because
you
have
made
me
like
unto
yourself
for
verily
your
promise
in
the
garden
in
the
dawn
of
this
world
days
was
not
vain
and
i
have
tasted
the
fruit
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
o
satan
presently
giovanni
resumed
again
i
know
i
see
i
feel
i
will
i
suffer
and
i
love
you
for
all
the
ill
you
have
done
me
i
love
you
because
you
have
undone
me
and
leaning
on
the
archangel
shoulder
the
man
wept
bitterly
the
mystic
blood
to
félix
jeantet
the
mystic
blood
bocca

footnote
his
mouth
spake
no
word
but
only
jesus
and
caterina
and
with
these
words
i
received
his
head
in
my
two
hands
as
he
closed
his
eyes
in
the
divine
goodness
and
said
i
will
of
catherine
of
xcvii
ed
gigli
e
burlamacchi
the
good
town
of
sienna
was
like
a
sick
man
that
seeks
vainly
for
a
restful
place
in
his
bed
and
thinks
by
turning
about
and
about
to
cheat
his
pain
again
and
again
had
she
changed
the
government
of
the
republic
which
passed
from
the
consuls
to
the
assemblies
of
the
burghers
and
originally
entrusted
to
the
nobles
was
subsequently
exercised
by
the
drapers
apothecaries
furriers
and
all
such
citizens
as
were
concerned
with
the
superior
arts
and
crafts
but
these
worthies
having
shown
themselves
weak
and
the
people
expelled
them
in
their
turn
and
entrusted
the
sovereign
power
to
the
petty
artisans
in
the
year
of
the
glorious
incarnation
of
the
son
of
god
the
signory
was
composed
of
fourteen
magistrates
chosen
from
among
the
hosiers
butchers
locksmiths
shoemakers
and
stonemasons
who
together
formed
a
great
council
known
as
the
of
the
they
were
a
plebeian
band
rough
and
hard
as
the
bronze
emblem
of
their
city
which
they
loved
with
an
affection
at
once
filial
and
formidable
but
the
people
which
had
set
them
up
over
the
commonwealth
had
suffered
another
body
to
continue
in
existence
though
subordinate
to
them
the
twelve
to
wit
who
came
from
the
class
of
bankers
and
wealthy
merchants
these
men
were
in
conspiracy
with
the
nobles
at
the
emperor
instigation
to
sell
the
city
to
the
pope
of
rome
the
german
kaiser
was
the
life
and
soul
of
the
plot
promising
the
aid
of
his
landsknechts
to
guarantee
success
he
was
in
the
utmost
haste
to
have
the
affair
ended
hoping
with
the
price
of
the
bargain
he
might
be
able
to
redeem
the
crown
of
charlemagne
pledged
for
sixteen
hundred
florins
with
the
florentine
bankers
meantime
they
of
the
who
formed
the
signory
held
firm
the
rod
of
government
and
watched
heedfully
over
the
safety
of
the
republic
these
artisans
officers
of
a
free
people
had
refused
the
emperor
when
he
came
within
their
walls
bread
water
salt
and
fire
they
had
driven
him
forth
the
city
groaning
and
trembling
and
they
now
condemned
the
conspirators
to
death
guardians
of
the
town
founded
by
remus
long
ago
they
copied
the
sternness
of
the
first
consuls
of
rome
but
their
city
which
went
clad
in
silk
and
was
ever
ready
to
slip
betwixt
their
fingers
like
a
lascivious
wanton
and
fear
and
anxiety
made
them
implacable
in
the
year
they
discovered
that
a
nobleman
of
perugia
ser
niccola
tuldo
had
been
sent
by

pope
to

was
in
the
prime
of
manly
beauty
and
had
learned
in
the
company
of
fair
ladies
those
arts
of
flattery
and
seductive
compliment
he
now
proceeded
to
practise
in
the
palace
of
the
salimbeni
and
the
shops
of
the
and
for
all
his
light
heart
and
empty
head
he
gained
over
to
the
pope
side
many
burghers
and
some
artisans
informed
of
his
intrigues
the
magistrates
of
the
of
the
had
him
brought
before
their
august
council
and
after
questioning
him
underneath
the
gonfalon
of
the
republic
which
shows
a
lion
rampant
for
device
they
declared
him
guilty
of
attempted
outrage
against
the
liberties
of
the
city
he
had
answered
with
mere
smiling
scorn
to
the
questions
of
these
cobbler
fellows
and
butchers
but
when
he
heard
his
sentence
of
death
pronounced
he
fell
into
ecstasy
of
deep
astonishment
and
was
led
away
to
prison
as
if
in
a
trance
no
sooner
was
he
locked
up
in
his
cell
than
awaking
from
his
stupor
he
began
to
regret
the
life
he
was
to
lose
with
all
the
ardour
of
his
young
blood
and
impetuous
character
visions
of
all
its
pleasures
arms
women
horses
crowded
before
his
eyes
and
at
the
thought
he
would
never
enjoy
the
delights
more
he
was
carried
away
by
so
furious
a
despair
he
beat
with
fists
and
forehead
on
the
walls
of
his
dungeon
and
gave
vent
to
such
wild
howls
as
were
audible
over
all
the
neighbourhood
even
in
the
burghers
houses
and
the
drapers
booths
the
gaoler
coming
in
to
know
the
cause
of
the
uproar
found
him
covered
with
blood
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
ser
niccola
tuldo
never
left
off
howling
with
rage
for
three
days
and
three
nights
the
thing
was
reported
to
the
of
the
the
members
of
the
most
august
signory
after
despatching
their
more
pressing
business
examined
into
the
case
of
the
unhappy
man
in
the
condemned
cell
leone
rancati
brickmaker
by
trade
said
the
man
must
pay
with
his
head
for
his
crime
against
the
commonwealth
of
sienna
and
none
can
relieve
him
of
this
debt
without
encroaching
on
the
sacred
rights
of
the
city
our
mother
he
must
needs
die
but
his
soul
is
his
maker
and
it
is
not
meet
that
through
our
fault
he
die
in
this
sinful
state
of
madness
and
despair
therefore
should
we
use
all
the
means
within
our
competence
to
assure
his
eternal
salvation
matteino
renzano
the
baker
a
man
famed
for
his
wisdom
rose
in
his
turn
and
said
well
spoken
leone
rancati
the
case
demands
we
send
to
the
condemned
man
catherine
the
fuller
daughter
the
advice
was
approved
by
all
the
signory
who
resolved
to
invite
catherine
to
visit
niccola
tuldo
in
his
prison
in
those
days
catherine
daughter
of
giacomo
the
fuller
filled
all
the
city
of
sienna
with
the
perfume
of
her
virtues
she
dwelt
in
a
little
cell
in
her
father
house
and
wore
the
habit
of
the
sisters
of
penitence
she
carried
girt
about
her
under
her
gown
of
white
linen
an
iron
chain
and
scourged
herself
an
hour
long
every
day
then
showing
her
arms
covered
with
wounds
she
would
cry
behold
my
pretty
red
roses
she
cultivated
in
her
chamber
lilies
and
violets
wherewith
she
wove
garlands
for
the
altars
of
the
virgin
and
the
saints
and
all
the
while
she
would
be
singing
hymns
in
the
vulgar
tongue
to
the
praise
of
jesus
and
mary
his
mother
in
those
mournful
times
when
the
city
of
sienna
was
a
hostel
of
sorrow
and
a
house
of
joy
to
boot
catherine
was
ever
visiting
the
unhappy
prisoners
and
telling
the
prostitutes
my
sisters
how
fain
would
i
hide
you
in
the
loving
wounds
of
the
saviour
a
maiden
so
pure
fired
with
so
sweet
charity
could
nowhere
have
budded
and
blossomed
but
at
sienna
which
under
all
its
defilements
and
amid
all
its
crimes
was
still
the
city
of
the
blessed
virgin
apprised
by
the
magistrates
catherine
betook
herself
to
the
public
gaol
on
the
morning
of
the
day
ser
niccola
tuldo
was
to
die
she
found
him
stretched
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
dungeon
bellowing
blasphemies
raising
the
white
veil
the
blessed
dominic
himself
had
come
down
from
paradise
to
lay
upon
her
brow
she
showed
the
prisoner
a
countenance
of
heavenly
beauty
as
he
gazed
at
her
in
wonder
she
leant
over
him
to
wipe
away
the
spume
that
defiled
his
mouth
ser
niccola
tuldo
turning
on
her
eyes
that
still
retained
their
savage
ferocity
cried
out
begone
i
hate
you
because
you
are
of
sienna
the
city
that
slays
me
oh
sienna
indeed
that
with
her
vile
claws
tears
out
the
throat
of
a
noble
gentleman
of
perugia
horrid
unclean
and
inhuman
but
catherine
made
answer
nay
brother
what
is
a
city
what
are
all
the
cities
of
the
earth
beside
the
city
of
god
and
the
holy
angels
i
am
catherine
and
i
am
come
to
call
you
to
the
everlasting
nuptials
the
sweet
voice
and
beaming
face
shed
a
sudden
peace
and
radiance
over
the
savage
soul
of
niccola
tuldo
he
remembered
the
days
of
his
innocence
and
cried
like
a
child
the
sun
rising
above
the
apennines
was
just
whitening
the
prison
walls
with
its
earliest
rays
catherine
said
look
the
dawn
up
up
my
brother
for
the
eternal
nuptials
up
i
say
and
raising
him
from
the
ground
she
drew
him
into
the
chapel
where
fra
cattaneo
confessed
him
ser
niccola
tuldo
then
listened
devoutly
to
the
holy
mass
and
received
the
body
of
our
lord
this
done
he
turned
to
catherine
and
said
stay
with
me
do
not
leave
me
and
i
shall
be
well
and
shall
die
content
the
bells
began
to
toll
the
signal
for
the
execution
then
catherine
answered
gentle
brother
i
will
wait
you
at
the
place
of
justice
at
this
ser
niccola
smiled
and
said
as
if
ravished
with
bliss
joy
joy
the
delight
of
my
soul
will
wait
me
at
the
holy
place
of
justice
catherine
pondered
and
prayed
finally
saying
gracious
lord
thou
hast
indeed
wrought
in
him
a
great
enlightenment
seeing
he
calls
holy
the
place
of
justice
ser
niccola
went
on
yes
i
shall
hie
me
thither
strong
in
heart
and
rejoicing
i
weary
as
though
i
had
a
thousand
years
to
wait
to
be
there
where
i
shall
find
you
once
more
farewell
till
the
nuptials
the
everlasting
nuptials
catherine
cried
again
as
she
left
the
prison
the
condemned
man
was
served
with
a
little
bread
and
wine
and
supplied
with
a
black
cloak
then
he
was
led
forth
along
the
precipitous
streets
to
the
sound
of
trumpets
between
the
city
guards
beneath
the
banner
of
the
republic
the
ways
swarmed
with
curious
onlookers
and
women
lifted
their
little
ones
in
their
arms
showing
them
the
man
doomed
to
die
meantime
niccola
tuldo
was
dreaming
of
catherine
and
his
lips
that
had
so
long
been
bitter
opened
softly
as
though
to
kiss
the
likeness
of
the
blessed
maid
after
climbing
for
some
while
the
rude
road
the
procession
reached
one
of
the
heights
dominating
the
city
and
the
condemned
man
saw
suddenly
with
his
eyes
that
were
soon
to
see
no
more
the
roofs
domes
cloisters
and
towers
of
sienna
and
further
away
the
walls
that
followed
the
slope
of
the
hills
the
sight
reminded
him
of
his
native
town
the
gay
city
of
perugia
surrounded
with
its
gardens
where
springs
of
living
water
sing
amid
the
fruits
and
flowers
he
saw
once
more
in
fancy
the
terrace
that
looks
over
the
vale
of
trasimene
whence
the
eye
drinks
in
the
light
of
day
with
delight
and
the
yearning
for
life
tore
his
heart
afresh
and
he
sighed
oh
city
of
my
fathers
oh
house
of
my
birth
but
presently
the
thought
of
catherine
his
soul
filling
it
to
the
brim
with
gladness
and
sweet
peace
finally
they
arrive
in
the
market
square
where
each
saturday
the
peasant
girls
of
camiano
and
granayola
display
their
citrons
grapes
figs
and
pomegranates
and
hail
the
housewives
with
merry
appeals
to
buy
not
unmixed
with
jests
it
was
there
the
scaffold
was
erected
and
there
ser
niccola
beheld
catherine
kneeling
in
prayer
her
head
resting
on
the
block
he
climbed
the
steps
with
eager
joy
at
his
coming
catherine
rose
and
turned
toward
him
with
all
the
look
of
a
bride
once
more
united
to
her
spouse
she
insisted
on
baring
his
neck
with
her
own
hands
and
placing
her
dear
one
on
the
block
as
on
a
marriage
bed
then
she
knelt
down
beside
him
thrice
he
repeated
in
fervent
tones
jesus
catherine
after
which
the
executioner
struck
with
his
sword
and
the
maiden
caught
the
severed
head
within
her
hands
hereupon
all
the
victim
blood
seemed
to
be
suffused
in
her
and
to
fill
her
veins
with
a
flood
as
soft
as
warm
milk
a
fragrant
odour
set
her
nostrils
quivering
while
before
her
swooning
eyes
floated
the
shadows
of
angels
filled
with
wonder
and
joy
unspeakable
she
fell
softly
into
the
depths
of
celestial
ecstasy
two
women
of
the
third
order
of
dominic
who
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
seeing
her
stretched
there
motionless
hastened
to
raise
her
up
and
support
her
in
their
arms
the
holy
maid
coming
to
herself
told
them
i
have
seen
the
heavens
opened
one
of
the
women
made
as
though
to
wash
away
with
a
sponge
the
blood
that
covered
catherine
robe
but
she
stopped
her
crying
out
eagerly
no
no
leave
the
blood
leave
it
never
rob
me
of
my
purple
and
my
perfumes
a
sound

of
our
lady
as

fell
out

and
u
robert
of
all
the
merchants
of
venice
fabio
mutinelli
was
the
most
exact
in
keeping
his
engagements
in
all
cases
he
showed
himself
and
sumptuous
in
his
dealings
above
all
where
ladies
and
churchmen
were
concerned
the
elegance
and
honesty
of
his
character
were
renowned
throughout
the
state
and
all
admired
at
san
zanipolo
an
altar
of
gold
he
had
offered
to
catherine
for
the
love
of
the
fair
catherine
manini
wife
of
the
senator
alesso
cornaro
being
very
wealthy
he
had
numerous
friends
whom
he
entertained
at
feasts
and
helped
at
need
from
his
purse
however
he
incurred
heavy
losses
in
the
war
against
the
genoese
and
in
the
naples
troubles
it
fell
out
moreover
that
thirty
of
his
ships
were
taken
by
the
uscoque
pirates
or
foundered
at
sea
the
pope
to
whom
he
had
lent
great
sums
of
money
refused
to
repay
a
doit
the
result
of
all
was
the
magnificent
fabio
mutinelli
was
stripped
bare
in
brief
space
of
all
his
riches
after
selling
his
palace
and
plate
to
pay
what
he
owed
he
found
himself
left
without
anything
but
clever
bold
well
practised
in
affairs
and
in
the
vigour
of
his
powers
his
only
thought
was
to
make
head
once
more
against
fortune
he
made
careful
calculation
and
judged
that
five
hundred
ducats
were
needful
for
him
to
take
the
sea
again
and
attempt
fresh
enterprises
for
which
he
augured
happy
and
sure
success
he
asked
the
signor
alesso
bontura
who
was
the
richest
citizen
of
the
republic
to
oblige
him
by
lending
him
the
five
hundred
ducats
but
the
good
bontura
holding
that
if
daring
wins
great
gains
is
prudence
only
keeps
the
same
refused
to
expose
so
great
a
sum
to
the
risks
of
sea
and
shipwreck
fabio
next
applied
to
the
signor
andrea
morosini
whom
he
had
benefited
in
former
days
in
a
thousand
ways
my
dear
fabio
answered
andrea
to
any
one
else
but
you
i
would
willingly
lend
this
sum
i
have
no
affection
for
gold
and
on
this
point
act
according
to
the
maxims
of
horace
the
satirist
but
your
friendship
is
dear
to
me
fabio
mutinelli
and
i
should
be
running
the
risk
of
losing
it
if
i
lent
you
money
for
more
often
than
not
the
commerce
of
the
heart
comes
to
a
bad
end
betwixt
debtor
and
creditor
i
have
known
but
too
many
instances
so
saying
the
signor
andrea
kissed
the
merchant
with
all
seeming
tenderness
and
shut
the
door
in
his
face
next
day
fabio
went
to
see
the
lombard
and
florentine
bankers
but
not
one
of
them
would
agree
to
lend
him
so
much
as
twenty
ducats
without
security
all
day
long
he
hurried
from
one
to
another
but
was
everywhere
met
by
much
the
same
answer
signor
fabio
we
all
know
you
well
for
the
most
upright
merchant
of
this
city
and
it
is
with
regret
we
must
refuse
you
what
you
ask
but
the
morality
of
trade
requires
it
that
evening
as
he
was
making
sadly
for
home
the
courtesan
zanetta
who
was
bathing
in
the
canal
hung
on
to
his
gondola
and
gazed
amorously
into
his
eyes
in
the
days
of
his
prosperity
he
had
had
her
one
night
into
his
palace
and
had
treated
her
very
kindly
for
he
was
of
a
gay
and
gracious
humour
sweet
signor
fabio
she
said
to
him
i
am
aware
of
your
misfortunes
they
are
the
talk
of
all
the
town
hear
me
i
am
not
rich
but
i
have
some
jewels
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
coffer
an
you
will
accept
them
of
a
poor
girl
that
would
serve
you
i
shall
know
god
and
the
virgin
love
me
and
it
was
a
true
word
that
in
the
prime
of
her
youth
and
fine
flower
of
her
beauty
the
fair
zanetta
was
poor
fabio
answered
her
kind
zanetta
there
is
more
nobility
in
the
hovel
where
you
dwell
than
in
all
the
palaces
of
venice
for
three
days
longer
fabio
visited
the
banks
and
fondacos
without
discovering
any
one
willing
to
lend
him
money
everywhere
he
received
an
unfavourable
answer
and
listened
to
speeches
that
always
came
to
this
you
did
very
wrong
to
sell
your
plate
to
pay
your
debts
money
is
lent
to
a
man
in
debt
but
not
to
one
without
furniture
and
plate
the
fifth
day
he
made
his
way
in
despair
as
far
as
the
corte
delle
galli
which
men
also
call
the
ghetto
and
which
is
the
quarter
the
jews
inhabit
who
knows
he
kept
saying
to
himself
if
i
may
not
get
from
one
of
the
circumcised
what
the
christians
have
denied
me
he
proceeded
therefore
between
the
calle
san
geremia
and
the
calle
san
girolamo
along
a
narrow
canal
the
entrance
of
which
was
barred
with
chains
every
night
by
order
of
the
senate
while
hesitating
to
know
which
usurer
he
should
first
apply
to
he
remembered
to
have
heard
speak
of
an
israelite
named
eliezer
son
of
eliezer
maimonides
who
was
said
to
be
exceedingly
rich
and
of
a
wondrous
subtle
spirit
accordingly
inquiring
out
the
house
of
the
jew
eliezer
he
stopped
his
gondola
before
the
door
above
the
entrance
was
seen
a
representation
of
the
candlestick
which
the
jew
had
had
carved
as
a
sign
of
hope
in
expectation
of
the
promised
days
when
the
temple
should
rise
again
from
its
ashes
the
merchant
now
entered
a
hall
lighted
by
a
copper
lamp
with
twelve
wicks
that
were
burning
smokily
eliezer
the
jew
was
there
seated
before
his
scales
the
windows
of
the
house
were
walled
up
because
he
was
an
unbeliever
fabio
mutinelli
approached
and
thus
accosted
him
eliezer
over
and
over
again
have
i
called
you
dog
and
renegade
heathen
there
have
been
times
when
i
was
younger
and
in
the
flush
of
early
manhood
i
have
cast
stones
and
mud
at
folks
going
along
the
canal
who
wore
the
round
patch
of
yellow
sewn
on
their
shoulder
so
that
i
may
likely
have
struck
one
of
your
friends
or
perhaps
yourself
i
tell
you
this
not
to
affront
you
but
out
of
fairness
at
the
same
instant
i
come
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
very
great
service
the
jew
lifted
his
arm
which
was
as
dry
and
gnarled
as
an
ancient
fabio
mutinelli
the
father
which
is
in
heaven
shall
judge
us
one
and
the
other
what
is
the
service
you
are
come
to
ask
of
me
lend
me
five
hundred
ducats
for
a
year
men
do
not
lend
without
security
doubtless
you
have
learned
this
from
your
own
people
what
is
the
security
you
offer
you
must
know
eliezer
i
have
not
a
denier
left
not
one
gold
cup
not
one
silver
goblet
neither
have
i
a
friend
left
one
and
all
they
have
refused
to
do
me
the
service
i
ask
of
you
i
have
nothing
in
all
the
world
but
my
honour
as
a
merchant
and
my
faith
as
a
christian
i
offer
you
for
security
the
holy
virgin
mary
and
her
divine
son
at
this
reply
the
jew
bending
down
his
head
as
a
man
does
to
ponder
and
consider
stroked
his
long
white
beard
for
a
while
presently
he
looked
up
and
said
fabio
mutinelli
take
me
to
see
this
security
you
offer
for
it
is
meet
the
lender
be
put
in
presence
of
the
pledge
proposed
for
his
acceptance
you
are
within
your
rights
returned
the
merchant
rise
therefore
and
come
so
saying
he
led
eliezer
to
the
chiesa
dell
orto
near
the
spot
called
the
of
the
arrived
there
and
pointing
to
the
figure
of
the
madonna
which
stood
above
the
high
altar
the
brow
wreathed
with
a
circlet
of
precious
stones
and
the
shoulders
covered
with
a
mantle
holding
in
her
arms
the
child
jesus
sumptuously
adorned
like
his
mother
the
merchant
said
to
the
jew
yonder
is
my
security
eliezer
looked
with
a
keen
eye
and
a
calculating
air
first
at
the
christian
merchant
then
at
the
madonna
and
child
then
presently
bowed
his
head
in
assent
and
said
he
would
accept
the
pledge
offered
he
returned
with
fabio
to
his
own
house
and
there
handed
him
the
five
hundred
ducats
well
and
truly
weighed
the
money
is
yours
for
a
year
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
to
the
day
you
have
not
paid
me
back
the
sum
with
interest
at
the
rate
fixed
by
the
law
of
venice
and
the
custom
of
the
lombards
you
can
picture
yourself
fabio
mutinelli
what
i
shall
think
of
the
christian
merchant
and
his
security
fabio
without
a
moment
loss
of
time
bought
ships
and
loaded
up
with
salt
and
other
sorts
of
merchandise
which
he
disposed
of
in
the
cities
of
the
adriatic
shore
to
great
advantage
then
with
a
fresh
cargo
aboard
he
set
sail
for
constantinople
where
he
bought
carpets
perfumes
peacock
feathers
ivory
and
ebony
these
goods
his
agents
exchanged
along
the
coasts
of
dalmatia
for
building
timber
which
the
venetians
had
contracted
for
from
him
in
advance
by
these
means
in
six
months
time
he
had
multiplied
tenfold
the
amount
the
jew
had
lent
him
but
one
day
that
he
was
taking
his
diversion
with
some
greek
women
aboard
his
vessel
which
lay
in
the
bosphorus
having
put
out
too
far
to
sea
he
was
captured
by
pirates
and
carried
prisoner
to
egypt
though
by
rare
good
fortune
his
gold
and
merchandise
were
in
a
safe
place
all
the
while
the
pirates
sold
him
to
a
saracen
lord
who
putting
him
in
fetters
sent
him
afield
to
till
the
wheat
which
grows
very
finely
in
that
country
fabio
offered
his
master
to
pay
a
heavy
ransom
but
the
paynim
daughter
who
loved
him
and
was
fain
to
bring
him
to
the
end
she
desired
her
father
not
to
let
him
go
at
any
price
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
trusting
to
himself
alone
for
release
he
filed
his
irons
with
the
tools
given
him
for
tilling
the
ground
made
good
his
escape
to
the
nile
and
threw
himself
into
a
boat
casting
loose
he
got
to
the
sea
which
was
not
far
off
and
when
on
the
point
of
death
from
thirst
and
hunger
was
rescued
by
a
spanish
vessel
bound
for
genoa
but
after
keeping
her
course
a
week
the
ship
was
caught
in
a
storm
which
drove
her
on
the
coast
of
dalmatia
in
making
the
shore
she
was
wrecked
on
a
reef
all
the
crew
were
drowned
except
fabio
who
reached
the
beach
after
much
difficulty
clinging
to
a
there
he
lay
senseless
but
was
presently
succoured
by
a
handsome
widow
named
loreta
whose
house
was
upon
the
seashore
she
had
him
carried
to
it
put
him
to
bed
in
her
own
chamber
watched
over
him
and
lavished
every
care
for
his
recovery
on
coming
to
himself
he
smelt
the
perfume
of
myrtles
and
roses
and
looking
out
of
window
saw
a
garden
that
descended
in
successive
declivities
to
the
sea
signora
loreta
standing
at
his
bed
head
took
up
her
viol
and
began
playing
a
tender
air
fabio
ravished
with
gratitude
and
pleasure
fell
to
kissing
the
hands
a
thousand
times
over
he
thanked
her
earnestly
assuring
her
he
was
less
touched
by
the
saving
of
his
life
than
by
the
fact
of
his
owing
his
recovery
to
the
pains
of
so
fair
a
benefactress
presently
he
rose
and
went
to
walk
with
her
in
the
garden
and
sitting
down
to
rest
in
a
thicket
of
myrtles
he
drew
the
young
widow
on
his
knee
and
manifested
his
gratitude
by
a
thousand
caresses
he
found
her
not
insensible
to
his
efforts
and
spent
some
hours
by
her
side
drowned
in
amorous
delight
but
soon
he
grew
pensive
and
suddenly
asked
his
hostess
what
month
they
were
in
and
what
day
of
the
month
precisely
it
then
was
and
when
she
told
him
he
fell
to
groaning
and
lamenting
sore
finding
it
lacked
but
short
hours
of
a
full
year
since
he
had
received
the
five
hundred
ducats
of
eliezer
the
jew
the
thought
of
breaking
his
promise
and
exposing
his
pledge
to
the
reproaches
of
the
circumcised
was
intolerable
to
him
signora
loreta
inquiring
the
reason
of
his
despair
he
told
her
the
whole
story
and
being
a
very
pious
woman
and
an
ardent
votress
of
the
holy
mother
of
god
she
shared
his
chagrin
to
the
full
the
difficulty
was
not
to
procure
the
five
hundred
ducats
a
banker
in
a
neighbouring
town
had
had
such
a
sum
in
his
hands
for
the
last
six
months
at
fabio
disposition
but
to
travel
from
the
coast
of
dalmatia
to
venice
in
hours
with
a
broken
sea
and
contrary
winds
was
a
thing
beyond
all
hope
let
us
have
the
money
ready
to
begin
with
said
fabio
and
when
one
of
his
hostess
had
brought
the
sum
the
noble
merchant
ordered
a
vessel
to
be
brought
close
in
to
the
shore
in
her
he
laid
the
bags
containing
the
ducats
then
went
to
the
signora
loreta
oratory
in
search
of
an
image
of
the
virgin
with
the
infant
jesus
an
image
of
and
greatly
revered
this
he
set
in
the
little
bark
near
the
rudder
and
addressed
in
these
words
madonna
you
are
my
pledge
now
the
jew
eliezer
must
needs
be
paid
is
a
question
of
mine
honour
and
of
yours
madonna
and
of
your
son
good
name
what
a
mortal
sinner
such
as
i
can
not
do
you
will
assuredly
accomplish
unsullied
star
of
the
sea
you
whose
bosom
suckled
him
who
walked
upon
the
waters
bear
this
silver
to
eliezer
the
jew
in
the
ghetto
at
venice
to
the
end
the
circumcised
may
never
say
you
are
a
bad
surety
and
pushing
the
bark
afloat
he
doffed
his
hat
and
cried
softly
farewell
madonna
farewell
the
vessel
sailed
out
to
sea
and
long
the
merchant
and
the
widow
followed
it
with
their
eyes
when
night
began
to
close
in
a
furrow
of
light
was
seen
marking
her
wake
over
the
waters
which
were
fallen
to
a
dead
calm
at
venice
next
morning
eliezer
on
opening
his
door
saw
a
bark
in
the
narrow
canal
of
the
ghetto
laden
with
full
sacks
and
manned
by
a
little
figure
of
black
wood
flashing
in
the
clear
morning
sunbeams
the
vessel
stopped
before
the
house
where
the
candlestick
was
carved
and
the

recognized

doña
maria
one
of
the
fair
princesses
of
the
land
and
married
to
the
prince
of
venosa
was
enamoured
of
the
count
likewise
one
of
the
noble
princes
of
the
country
so
being
both
of
them
come
together
to
enjoy
their
passion
and
the
husband
having
discovered
it
had
the
twain
of
them
slain
by
men
appointed
thereto
in
such
wise
that
next
morning
the
fair
and
noble
pair
unhappy
beings
were
seen
lying
stretched
out
and
exposed
to
public
view
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
house
door
all
dead
and
cold
in
sight
of
all
who
could
not
but
weep
and
lament
over
their
piteous
lot
it
was
a
day
of
high
rejoicing
at
naples
when
the
prince
of
venosa
a
rich
and
puissant
lord
was
wed
to
doña
maria
of
the
illustrious
house
of
avalos
drawn
by
horses
bedizened
with
scales
feathers
or
furs
in
such
wise
as
to
figure
forth
dragons
griffins
lions
lynxes
panthers
and
unicorns
were
twelve
cars
which
did
bear
through
all
the
city
an
host
of
naked
men
and
women
gilded
all
over
for
to
represent
the
gods
of
olympus
come
down
to
earth
to
do
honour
to
the
venosian
nuptials
on
one
of
these
cars
was
to
be
seen
a
young
lad
with
wings
treading
underfoot
three
old
hags
of
an
hideous
ugliness
a
tablet
was
fixed
up
above
the
car
to
display
the
meaning
thereof
to
wit
love
vanquisheth
the
fatal
sisters
whereby
was
to
be
understood
that
the
pair
would
enjoy
many
a
long
year
of
happiness
by
each
other
side
but
this
presage
of
love
more
strong
than
the
fates
was
false
withal
two
years
after
her
marriage
one
day
she
was
gone
abroad
doña
maria
saw
the
duke
which
was
a
gallant
handsome
and
man
and
did
straight
love
the
same
an
honest
girl
and
a
heedful
of
her
noble
name
and
still
in
that
callow
youth
when
women
have
not
gotten
boldness
yet
to
match
their
naughty
desires
she
sent
no
to
the
nobleman
for
to
make
assignation
in
church
or
at
her
own
abode
she
never
told
her
love
but
did
bide
the
time
when
her
good
star
should
bring
beside
her
him
which
had
grown
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
more
dear
to
her
than
the
day
she
had
not
to
tarry
long
for
the
duke
had
noted
her
beauty
and
went
straightway
to
pay
his
court
to
the
prince
of
venosa
encountering
doña
maria
in
the
palace
with
no
other
by
he
did
beseech
her
in
right
gentle
and
withal
gallant
and
masterful
wise
that
very
favour
she
was
herself
well
disposed
and
well
resolved
to
grant
him
she
did
lead
him
to
her
chamber
instantly
and
did
there
refuse
him
naught
of
all
he
was
fain
to
have
of
her
but
when
he
did
proffer
her
his
thanks
for
that
she
had
graciously
yielded
to
his
desires
she
made
answer
my
lord
the
desire
was
mine
own
more
than
it
was
yours
i
it
was
was
fain
we
should
lie
in
the
arms
one
of
the
other
as
we
be
now
laid
in
this
bed
to
the
which
i
will
aye
make
you
dearly
welcome
as
oft
as
it
shall
please
you
to
come
thither
every
time
she
was
able
so
to
do
from
that
day
forth
doña
maria
would
receive
in
her
chamber
the
duke
and
this
was
many
a
time
and
oft
for
the
prince
of
venosa
went
much
to
the
chase
and
would
sometimes
spend
whole
weeks
together
diverting
him
with
his
friends
in
one
of
his
pleasure
houses
he
had
in
the
country
parts
the
whole
while
that
doña
maria
was
abed
with
her
lover
her
nurse
lucia
would
stand
at
the
chamber
door
telling
of
her
beads
and
trembling
sore
lest
the
prince
perchance
should
return
home
against
all
expectation
was
indeed
a
nobleman
mightily
feared
by
reason
of
his
jealous
and
grim
humour
his
enemies
did
reproach
him
for
his
cunning
and
cruelty
naming
him
mongrel
cur
of
fox
and
stinking
hound
if
ever
stinking
hound
was
but
his
friends
would
commend
him
for
that
he
kept
ever
in
sure
memory
whatsoever
of
right
or
wrong
folk
did
him
and
would
in
no
wise
suffer
patiently
any
injury
wrought
him
or
his
during
the
space
of
three
full
months
which
were
now
gone
by
the
lovers
had
great
joy
of
each
other
and
content
of
their
desires
without
or
let
or
hindrance
when
one
morning
the
nurse
came
to
seek
doña
maria
in
her
chamber
and
spake
thus
to
her
listen
my
pearl
of
pearls
albeit
my
words
this
day
will
be
neither
of
flowers
nor
but
of
a
right
serious
and
fearsome
matter
my
lord
the
prince
of
venosa
hath
heard
some
ill
report
concerning
you
and
the
duke
but
now
i
saw
him
in
the
palace
court
as
he
was
his
horse
he
was
gnawing
his
moustache
a
fell
sign
with
him
he
was
in
talk
with
two
fellows
which
had
little
of
the
air
about
them
of
leading
honest
lives
all
i
heard
him
tell
them
was
ye
without
being
seen
of
such
sort
the
orders
the
noble
prince
was
charging
them
withal
and
the
worst
is
he
did
stop
dead
whenas
he
set
eyes
on
me
my
own
little
pearl
of
price
so
true
as
god
is
in
the
holy
sacrament
an
if
the
prince
find
you
with
the
lord
duke
he
will
kill
both
the
twain
of
you
you
will
be
a
dead
woman
and
ah
me
what
will
become
of
me
the
nurse
spake
on
in
this
wise
and
besought
her
mistress
long
and
sore
but
doña
maria
did
send
her
away
without
deigning
so
much
as
one
word
of
answer
as
it
was
springtide
she
went
forth
that
same
day
in
the
country
with
some
ladies
of
the
city
they
were
following
a
path
bordered
with
all
when
one
of
the
ladies
said
thus
to
her
dogs
will
sometimes
come
and
stick
at
travellers
heels
doña
maria
well
look
we
be
dogged
by
a
great
black
and
white
hound
and
the
princess
turning
her
head
to
see
did
recognize
a
certain
dominican
monk
which
was
used
to
come
each
day
to
the
courtyard
of
the
palazzo
venosa
for
to
rest
in
the
shade
there
and
in
to
warm
him
in
the
great
kitchen
meanwhile
the
nurse
seeing
her
lady
mistress
paid
no
heed
to
her
words
ran
to
warn
the
duke
moreover
the
said
duke
had
reasons
of
his
own
to
fear
the
sweet
secret
of
his
loves
had
been
unhappily
discovered
the
very
evening
afore
finding
himself
followed
by
a
pair
of
ruffians
armed
with
arquebuses
he
had
killed
one
of
the
twain
with
a
whiles
the
other
had
taken
to
his
heels
the
duke
felt
no
doubt
now
but
these
two
rascals
had
been
set
at
him
by
the
prince
of
venosa
lucia
he
said
to
the
nurse
i
must
needs
shudder
at
this
danger
seeing
it
doth
threaten
my
lady
maria
no
less
than
myself
tell
her
i
will
not
return
again
to
her
chamber
cost
me
what
regrets
it
will
before
that
the
prince
suspicions
be
lulled
asleep
these
words
the
nurse
did
report
the
same
evening
to
doña
maria
which
did
hearken
to
them
with
impatience
biting
her
lip
till
the
blood
came
learning
that
the
prince
was
at
the
moment
abroad
she
bade
her
nurse
go
straight
to
fetch
the
duke
and
bring
him
into
her
chamber
and
so
soon
as
he
was
come
spake
thus
to
him
my
gracious
lord
a
day
spent
apart
from
you
is
to
me
the
cruellest
of
torments
i
shall
not
fear
to
die
but
i
have
not
the
fortitude
to
endure
your
absence
you
should
not
have
loved
me
if
you
had
not
the
hardihood
to
brave
all
for
love
of
me
you
should
not
have
loved
me
if
there
were
aught
else
in
all
the
world
you
set
above
my
love
even
mine
own
honour
and
mine
own
life
choose
either
you
shall
see
me
every
day
as
aforetime
or
you
shall
never
see
me
more
he
made
answer
well
and
good
then
lady
and
so
be
it
for
indeed
there
is
no
room
for
ill
or
evil
henceforth
betwixt
us
twain
verily
i
do
love
you
as
you
would
have
me
love
you
even
more
than
your
own
life
and
that
day
which
was
a
thursday
they
did
tarry
a
long
time
close
pressed
one
against
the
other
naught
of
moment
fell
out
ere
the
monday
of
the
next
week
on
the
which
day
the
prince
did
apprise
his
wife
how
that
he
was
setting
forth
with
a
numerous
train
for
rome
whither
he
was
called
by
the
pope
which
was
his
kinsman
and
in
very
deed
a
score
of
horses
were
then
standing
ready
saddled
and
bridled
in
the
great
court
then
did
the
prince
kiss
his
wife
hand
as
he
was
used
to
do
on
taking
leave
of
her
for
any
lengthy
absence
last
of
all
when
he
was
now
he
did
turn
his
face
to
her
and
say
god
have
you
in
his
keeping
doña
maria
and
so
rode
forth
with
his
company
behind
him
soon
as
ever
she
thought
her
husband
troop
to
be
gotten
forth
of
the
walls
the
princess
bade
her
nurse
summon
the
duke
to
her
the
old
woman
besought
her
to
defer
a
meeting
that
might
easily
be
cause
of
such
sore
calamity
my
dove
she
cried
falling
on
her
knees
her
hands
uplifted
in
supplication
receive
not
the
duke
all
night
long
i
heard
the
prince
men
grinding
swords
yet
another
thing
my
flower
of
flowers
the
good
brother
that
cometh
day
by
day
to
our
kitchen
to
seek
his
dole
of
bread
hath
but
now
overset
a
of
salt
with
the
sleeve
of
his
gown
give
your
lover
a
little
repose
little
one
your
pleasure
will
be
all
the
greater
to
have
him
again
presently
and
he
will
love
you
all
the
better
for
the
respite
but
doña
maria
said
nurse
an
if
he
be
not
here
in
one
quarter
of
an
hour
i
will
send
you
back
home
to
your
brethren
in
the
mountains
and
when
the
duke
was
by
her
side
she
did
welcome
him
with
an
exceeding
great
joy
my
lord
cried
she
this
will
be
a
good
day
for
us
and
the
night
better
still
i
shall
keep
you
till
the
dawn
and
straightway
did
they
exchange
betwixt
them
an
host
of
kisses
and
fond
caresses
presently
after
doffing
their
clothes
they
gat
them
to
bed
and
held
each
the
other
close
embraced
so
long
that
evening
found
them
yet
pressed
in
each
other
arms
then
for
that
they
were
sore
hungered
doña
maria
drew
forth
of
her
marriage
chest
a
pasty
dried
conserves
and
a
flask
of
wine
the
which
she
had
been
heedful
to
lay
by
therein
after
the
twain
had
eaten
and
drunk
their
fill
playing
the
while
all
sorts
of
pretty
plays
the
moon
rose
and
did
look
in
so
friendly
at
the
window
that
they
were
fain
to
wish
her
welcome
so
they
went
forth
upon
the
balcony
and
there
breathing
the
freshness
and
softness
of
the
night
did
watch
the
fireflies
dancing
in
the
dark
bushes
all
were
still
save
only
the
shrilling
of
the
insects
in
the
grass
then
there
came
a
sound
of
footsteps
along
the
street
and
doña
maria
did
recognize
the
poor
monk
which
was
wont
to
haunt
the
kitchen
and
the
palace
courtyards
the
same
she
had
encountered
one
day
in
the
flowery
path
where
she
was
with
two
ladies
her
companions
she
shut
to
the
window
softly
and
to
bed
again
with
her
lover
was
deep
in
the
night
and
they
were
lying
so
kissing
and
murmuring
the
softest
nothings
ever
were
inspired
by
love
whether
at
naples
or
any
other
spot
in
all
the
wide
world
when
of
a
sudden
they
caught
a
noise
of
steps
mounting
the
stairway
and
the
rattle
of
arms
at
the
same
time
they
beheld
a
red
glow
shining
through
the
chinks
of
the
door
and
they
heard
the
nurse
voice
shrieking
jesu
maria
i
am
a
dead
woman
the
duke
sprang
up
leapt
upon
his
sword
and
cried
up
doña
maria
we
must
leap
forth
by
the
window
but
rushing
to
the
balcony
and
leaning
out
he
saw
how
the
street
was
guarded
and
all
bristling
with
pikes
thereupon
he
came
back
to
doña
maria
which
said
is
the
end
of
all
but
know
this
i
do
not
regret
aught
of
what
i
have
done
my
dear
dear
lord
and
he
made
answer
well
and
good
then
and
so
be
it
and
did
haste
to
don
his
trunks
cracking
and
crunching
under
the
mighty
blows
struck
by
them
outside
the
door
was
meantime
and
the
panels
began
to
gape
he
spake
again
and
said
fain
would
i
know
who
hath
betrayed
and
sold
us
thus
at
the
instant
he
was
seeking
his
shoon
the
one
half
of
the
door
gave
way
and
a
troop
of
men
bearing
arms
and
torches
threw
themselves
into
the
chamber
the
prince
of
venosa
was
in
their
midst
shouting
have
at
the
traitor
kill
kill
lustily
did
three
swordsmen
attack
the
duke
but
he
set
him
in
front
of
the
bed
where
was
doña
maria
and
made
valiant
stand
against
the
caitiffs
six
men
were
there
in
all
led
on
by
the
prince
being
of
his
bosom
friends
every
one
or
his
own
varlets
albeit
blinded
by
the
dazzle
of
the
torches
the
duke
did
contrive
to
parry
several
thrusts
and
gave
back
some
shrewd
blows
himself
but
catching
his
foot
in
the
platters
lying
on
the
floor
with
the
remains
of
the
pasty
and
conserves
he
fell
over
backward
finding
himself
on
his
back
a
point
at
his
throat
he
did
seize
the
blade
in
his
left
hand
the
man
snatching
it
back
cut
off
three
of
his
fingers
and
the
sword
was
bent
then
as
the
duke
was
heaving
forward
his
shoulders
to
rise
one
of
the
fellows
struck
him
a
blow
over
the
head
which
did
break
in
the
bones
of
his
skull
at
this
all
six
did
hurl
them
upon
him
and
slew
him
lunging
with
such
savage
haste
they
did
wound
each
other
whenas
the
thing
was
done
the
prince
of
venosa
bade
them
stand
quietly
aside
and
marching
upon
doña
maria
which
till
now
had
tarried
still
beside
the
bed
he
drave
her
before
his
sword
point
into
the
corner
of
the
chamber
where
was
the
marriage
chest
and
there
holding
her
at
bay
he
did
hiss
in
her
face
one
word
harlot
shamed
by
reason
of
her
nakedness
she
went
to
drag
to
her
some
of
the
bedclothes
which
were
hanging
over
the
bedside
but
he
stayed
her
with
a
thrust
of
his
sword
which
did
graze
her
white
side
then
leaning
against
the
wall
hands
and
arms
held
up
to
veil
her
eyes
she
stood
waiting
the
other
never
left
off
crying
puttaccia
whore
whore
then
forasmuch
as
he
did
yet
tarry
and
slew
her
not
she
was
afraid
he
saw
that
she
was
afraid
and
said
gleefully
you
are
afraid
but
pointing
her
finger
at
the
dead
body
of
the
duke
she
made
answer
fool
what
think
you
i
can
have
to
fear
now
and
to
make
a
seeming
of
being
no
more
terrified
she
sought
to
recall
a
she
had
sung
many
a
time
as
a
girl
and
began
humming
the
same
or
rather
hissing
it
betwixt
her
teeth
the
prince
furious
to
see
how
she
defied
him
did
now
prick
her
with
his
point
in
the
belly
crying
out
fie
filthy
trull
exultant
she
stayed
her
singing
and
said
sir
is
two
years
sithence
i
have
been
to
confession
at
this
word
the
prince
of
venosa
bethought
him
how
that
an
if
she
died
and
were
damned
she
might
return
by
night
and
drag
him
down
to
hell
along
with
her
he
asked
her
will
you
not
have
a
confessor
she
did
ponder
an
instant
then
shaking
her
head
is
useless
i
can
not
save
my
soul
i
repent
me
not
i
can
not
and
i
will
not
repent
i
love
him
i
love
him
let
me
die
in
his
arms
with
a
quick
movement
she
did
thrust
the
sword
aside
threw
her
on
the
bleeding
corse
of
the
duke
and
lay
clipping
her
dead
lover
in
her
arms
seeing
her
so
the
prince
of
venosa
did
lose
what
patience
he
had
kept
till
then
to
the
end
he
might
not
kill
her
ere
he
had
made
her
suffer
he
drave
his
blade
through
her
body
she
cried
jesu
rolled
over
sprang
to
her
feet
and
after
a
little
shudder
that
shook
her
every
limb
fell
to
the
floor
dead
he
struck
her
several
blows
more
in
the
belly
and
bosom
then
said
to
his
varlets
go
throw
these
two
pieces
of
carrion
at
the
foot
of
the
great
staircase
and
open
wide
the
palace
doors
that
men
may
note
my
vengeance
at
the
same
time
as
the
insult
done
mine
honour
he
bade
strip
the
lover
corse
bare
like
the
other
the
men
did
as
they
were
bidden
and
all
the
day
the
bodies
of
the
duke
and
doña
maria
lay
naked
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
the
drew
near
to
see
them
and
the
news
of
the
bloody
deed
being
spread
about
the
city
a
great
press
of
curious
onlookers
came
crowding
before
the
palace
some
said
lo
a
good
deed
well
done
others
and
these
the
more
part
at
sight
of
so
lamentable
a
spectacle
were
filled
with
ruth
yet
durst
they
not
openly
commiserate
the
prince
victims
for
fear
of
evil
handling
by
his
armed
dependents
which
were
set
to
guard
the
bodies
young
men
gazed
at
the
princess
corse
for
to
discover
the
traces
of
that
beauty
which
had
been
her
undoing
while
the
little
children
would
be
expounding
one
to
the
other
the
meaning
of
that
they
saw
doña
maria
lay
stretched
on
her
back
the
lips
were
drawn
back
displaying
the
teeth
in
a
ghastly
smile
her
eyes
stood
wide
open
the
whites
only
showing
six
wounds
were
upon
her
three
in
the
belly
which
was
greatly
swollen
two
in
the
bosom
one
in
the
neck
the
last
had
bled
profusely
and
the
dogs
kept
fawning
up
to
lick
it
towards
nightfall
the
prince
bade
set
torches
of
resin
like
as
on
days
of
festival
in
the
bronze
rings
fixed
in
the
palace
walls
and
eke
kindle
great
fires
in
the
courtyard
to
the
end
all
men
might
see
the
criminals
plain
at
midnight
a
pious
widow
brought
coverings
and
spread
the
same
over
the
dead
bodies
but
by
the
prince
commandment
these
were
incontinent
torn
away
again
the
ambassador
of
spain
informed
of
the
unseemly
treatment
meted
to
a
lady
of
the
spanish
house
of
avalos
came
in
person
urgently
to
entreat
the
prince
of
venosa
to
stay
these
outrages
which
did
insult
the
noble
memory
of
the
duke
de
pescara
uncle
to
doña
maria
and
offend
in
their
tomb
so
many
great
captains
of
whose
blood
the
said
lady
was
descended
but
he
withdrew
after
profiting
naught
by
his
intercession
and
writ
a
letter
thereanent
to
his
catholic
majesty
the
poor
bodies
were
left
shamefully
exposed
as
before
toward
the
latter
end
of
the
night
the
curious
having
ceased
to
come
any
more
the
guards
were
withdrawn
then
a
dominican
monk

had

slip

of

naples
and
sicily
uncompromising
republicans
as
brutus
himself
they
drank
to
france
and
freedom
their
host
acknowledged
the
toast
then
turning
to
the
general
whom
he
had
seated
on
his
right
hand
nephew
said
he
are
you
not
curious
to
examine
the
genealogical
tree
painted
on
the
wall
yonder
you
will
be
gratified
to
see
from
it
that
we
are
descended
from
the
lombard
cadolingians
who
from
the
tenth
to
the
twelfth
centuries
covered
themselves
with
glory
by
their
fidelity
to
the
german
emperors
and
from
whom
sprung
prior
to
the
year
the
buonapartes
of
treviso
and
the
buonapartes
of
florence
the
latter
stock
proving
by
far
the
more
illustrious
at
this
the
officers
began
to
whisper
together
and
laugh
orderly
officer
chauvet
asked
berthier
behind
his
hand
if
the
republican
general
felt
flattered
to
possess
amongst
his
ancestors
a
lot
of
slaves
serving
the
eagle
while
lieutenant
thézard
was
ready
to
take
his
oath
the
general
owed
his
birth
to
good
and
nobody
else
meanwhile
the
canon
went
on
with
a
long
string
of
boasts
concerning
the
nobility
of
his
house
and
lineage
know
this
nephew
he
finished
by
saying
our
florentine
ancestors
well
deserved
their
name
they
were
ever
of
the
and
steadfast
defenders
of
mother
church
at
these
words
which
the
old
fellow
had
uttered
in
a
high
clear
voice
the
general
who
so
far
had
been
scarcely
listening
gathered
his
wandering
wits
together
and
raising
his
pale
thin
face
with
its
classically
moulded
features
threw
a
piercing
look
at
his
interlocutor
which
closed
his
lips
instantly
nay
uncle
he
cried
let
us
have
done
with
these
follies
the
rats
of
your
garret
are
very
welcome
to
these
parchments
for
me
then
he
added
in
a
voice
of
brass
the
only
nobility
i
vaunt
is
in
my
deeds
it
dates
from
the
vendémiaire
of
year
iv
the
day
i
swept
the
royalist
sections
with
from
the
steps
of
roch
come
let
us
drink
to
the
republic
is
the
arrow
of
evander
which
falls
not
to
earth
again
and
is
transformed
into
a
star
the
officers
answered
the
appeal
with
a
shout
of
enthusiasm
it
was
a
moment
when
berthier
himself
felt
a
republican
and
a
patriot
fire
junot
exclaimed
napoleon
had
no
need
for
ancestors
was
enough
for
him
his
soldiers
had
acclaimed
him
corporal
at
the
bridge
of
lodi
the
wines
had
the
dry
smack
of
gunflint
and
the
bouquet
of
powder
and
the
company
imbibed
freely
lieutenant
thézard
was
soon
in
a
condition
that
rendered
him
incapable
of
concealing
his
sentiments
proud
of
the
wounds
and
the
kisses
of
women
he
had
enjoyed
in
lavish
abundance
in
this
campaign
at
once
so
heroic
and
so
gallant
and
gay
he
informed
the
canon
without
more
ado
that
following
in
the
steps
of
bonaparte
the
french
were
going
to
march
round
the
world
upsetting
thrones
and
altars
in
every
land
giving
the
girls
bastards
and
ripping
up
the
bellies
of
all
fanatics
the
old
priest
only
went
on
smiling
and
replied
he
was
willing
enough
to
sacrifice
to
their
noble
rage
not
indeed
the
pretty
girls
whom
he
besought
them
rather
to
treat
cannily
but
the
fanatics
the
chiefest
foes
he
said
of
holy
church
junot
promised
him
to
deal
leniently
with
the
nuns
he
could
heartily
commend
some
of
them
having
found
them
to
possess
tender
hearts
and
the
whitest
of
skins
orderly
officer
chauvet
maintained
we
should
take
account
of
the
influence
exercised
by
the
cloistered
life
on
the
complexion
of
young
women
you
see
he
was
a
student
of
natural
philosophy
between
genoa
and
milan
he
went
on
we
tasted
largely
of
this
sort
of
forbidden
fruit
one
may
profess
to
be
without
prejudices
still
a
pretty
bosom
does
look
prettier
half
hid
by
the
veil
i
set
no
value
on
religious
vows
yet
i
am
free
to
confess
i
attach
a
very
special
value
to
a
fine
leg
if
it
belongs
to
a
nun
strange
contradictions
of
the
human
heart
fie
fie
put
in
berthier
what
pleasure
can
you
find
in
upsetting
the
wits
and
troubling
the
senses
of
these
unhappy
victims
of
fanaticism
what
are
there
no
women
of
condition
in
italy
to
whom
you
could
offer
your
vows
at
fêtes
under
the
venetian
cloak
that
favours
little
intrigues
so
admirably
is
it
nothing
that
pietra
grua
mariani
madame
lambert
signora
monti
signora
gherardi
of
brescia
are
fair
and
gallant
dames
as
he
ran
over
the
names
of
these
italian
toasts
he
was
thinking
of
the
princess
visconti
this
great
lady
finding
herself
unable
to
enthral
bonaparte
had
given
herself
to
his
chief
of
the
staff
whom
she
loved
with
a
fire
of
wantonness
and
a
refined
sensuality
which
left
their
mark
on
the
berthier
for
the
rest
of
his
days
for
my
own
part
interrupted
lieutenant
thézard
i
shall
never
forget
a
little
seller
on
the
steps
of
the
duomo
who
the
general
rose
from
his
chair
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
a
bare
three
hours
was
left
them
for
sleep
as
they
were
to
start
at
dawn
never
trouble
kinsman
about
our
sleeping
accommodation
he
said
addressing
the
canon
we
are
soldiers
a
bundle
of
hay
is
good
enough
for
us
but
their
excellent
host
had
had
beds
prepared
his
house
was
bare
and
unornamented
but
of
vast
proportions
he
conducted
the
french
officers
one
after
the
other
to
the
rooms
assigned
them
and
wished
them
a
good
night
left
alone
in
his
chamber
bonaparte
threw
off
his
coat
and
sword
and
proceeded
to
scrawl
a
pencil
note
to
josephine
twenty
illegible
lines
in
which
his
violent
yet
calculating
spirit
spoke
loudly
then
folding
the
letter
he
abruptly
drove
the
woman
image
from
his
mind
as
you
a
drawer
he
unrolled
a
plan
of
mantua
and
selected
the
point
on
which
he
should
concentrate
his
fire
he
was
still
absorbed
in
his
calculations
when
he
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
he
thought
it
was
berthier
but
it
proved
to
be
the
canon
who
came
to
ask
him
for
a
few
minutes
conversation
under
his
arm
he
carried
two
or
three
portfolios
the
general
looked
at
these
documents
with
something
of
a
quizzical
air
he
felt
certain
they
contained
the
genealogy
of
the
buonapartes
and
anticipated
their
leading
to
a
talk
however
he
suffered
no
trace
of
his
impatience
to
appear
he
was
never
morose
or
angry
but
when
he
deliberately
made
up
his
mind
to
be
so
now
he
had
no
sort
of
wish
to
offend
his
worthy
kinsman
on
the
contrary
he
was
anxious
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
him
moreover
he
was
not
really
sorry
to
learn
the
nobility
of
his
race
now
his
jacobin
officers
were
no
longer
there
to
laugh
or
take
umbrage
at
the
matter
he
begged
the
canon
to
take
a
seat
who
did
so
and
laying
his
registers
on
the
table
said
i
made
a
beginning
during
supper
nephew
of
telling
you
about
the
buonapartes
of
florence
but
i
gathered
by
the
look
you
gave
me
it
was
not
then
the
place
or
time
to
enlarge
on
such
a
subject
i
broke
off
therefore
reserving
the
essential
part
of
what
i
have
to
say
for
the
present
moment
i
beg
of
you
kinsman
to
hear
me
with
great
attention
the
tuscan
branch
of
our
family
produced
some
excellent
representatives
among
whom
should
be
named
jacopo
di
buonaparte
who
witnessed
the
sack
of
rome
in
and
wrote
an
account
of
that
event
also
niccolò
author
of
a
comedy
entitled
that
was
declared
the
work
of
another
terence
however
it
is
not
of
these
two
famous
ancestors
i
now
wish
to
speak
but
rather
of
a
third
who
eclipses
them
as
much
in
glory
as
the
sun
outshines
the
stars
know
then
that
your
family
counts
amongst
its
members
a
man
of
saintly
life
deemed
worthy
of
beatification
and
the
title
of
blessed
fra
bonaventura
disciple
of
the
reformed
order
of
francis
who
died
in
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
the
old
man
bent
his
head
reverently
as
he
pronounced
the
name
then
he
resumed
with
a
fire
scarcely
to
have
been
expected
from
one
of
his
years
and
easy
character
fra
bonaventura
ah
kinsman
is
to
him
to
this
good
father
you
owe
the
success
of
your
arms
he
was
beside
you
doubt
it
not
when
you
annihilated
as
you
told
us
at
supper
the
enemies
of
your
party
on
the
steps
of
roch
this
capuchin
friar
has
been
your
helper
the
smoke
of
battles
but
for
him
be
assured
you
would
not
have
been
victorious
whether
at
montenotte
or
millesimo
or
lodi
the
marks
of
his
patronage
are
too
striking
and
to
be
ignored
and
in
your
success
i
plainly
discern
a
miracle
of
the
good
fra
bonaventura
but
what
is
most
important
you
should
know
is
this
the
holy
man
had
a
purpose
of
his
own
in
view
when
giving
you
the
advantage
even
over
beaulieu
himself
he
led
you
from
victory
to
victory
to
this
antique
roof
under
which
you
rest
with
an
old
man
blessing
to
keep
you
i
am
here
for
the
very
purpose
of
revealing
his
intentions
to
you
fra
bonaventura
wished
you
should
be
informed
of
his
merits
that
you
should
hear
of
his
fasts
and
austerities
and
the
whole
year
silence
he
once
condemned
himself
to
endure
he
would
have
you
touch
his
and
scourge
and
his
knees
stiffened
so
at
the
that
he
walked
bent
double
like
the
letter
z
for
this
it
was
he
has
brought
you
into
italy
where
he
was
for
contriving
you
an
opportunity
of
returning
him
benefit
for
benefit
for
you
must
know
good
kinsman
if
the
friar
has
helped
you
greatly
in
your
turn
you
can
be
of
the
greatest
use
to
him
with
these
words
the
canon
laid
his
hands
on
the
heavy
portfolios
that
loaded
the
table
and
drew
a
deep
breath
bonaparte
said
nothing
but
waited
quietly
for
the
canon
to
go
on
with
his
remarks
which
diverted
him
greatly
never
was
any
one
easier
to
amuse
than
napoleon
after
recovering
breath
the
old
man
resumed
why
yes
kinsman
you
can
be
of
the
greatest
use
to
fra
bonaventura
who
in
his
present
situation
needs
your
help
he
was
beatified
many
years
ago
but
is
still
waiting
his
admission
to
the
calendar
of
saints
he
is
thinking
long
is
the
good
father
bonaventura
yet
what
can
i
a
poor
canon
of
san
miniato
do
for
him
to
secure
him
the
honour
he
has
earned
his
enrolment
demands
an
outlay
that
goes
far
beyond
my
fortune
and
even
the
resources
of
the
bishopric
poor
canon
poor
diocese
poor
duchy
of
tuscany
poor
italy
they
are
all
poor
together
it
is
you
kinsman
must
ask
the
pope
to
recognize
fra
bonaventura
claim
he
will
certainly
grant
you
so
much
his
holiness
will
never
refuse
for
your
sake
to
add
another
saint
to
the
calendar
great
honour
will
accrue
to
yourself
and
your
family
and
the
good
friar
will
always
be
ready
to
afford
you
his
patronage
do
you
not
realize
the
advantages
of
having
a
saint
in
the
family
and
the
canon
pointing
to
the
portfolios
urged
the
general
to
put
them
in
his
valise
and
take
them
with
him
their
contents
consisted
of
the
memorial
relating
to
the
canonization
of
the
blessed
friar
bonaventura
together
with
documents
in
corroboration
of
his
claim
promise
me
he
added
that
you
will
see
to
this
matter
the
most
important
that
can
concern
you
bonaparte
restrained
his
strong
inclination
to
laugh
i
am
unfortunately
situated
he
objected
for
undertaking
a
case
for
canonization
you
are
aware
that
the
french
republic
is
taking
measures
to
exact
compensation
from
the
court
of
rome
for
the
murder
of
her
ambassador
bassville
foully
assassinated
the
canon
protested
eagerly
corpo
di
bacco
the
court
of
rome
will
find
excuses
enough
all
due
compensation
will
be
accorded
and
our
kinsman
will
be
placed
on
the
calendar
never
fear
the
negotiations
are
far
from
being
concluded
at
present
replied
the
republican
general
the
roman
curia
has
yet
to
recognize
the
civil
constitution
of
the
french
clergy
and
to
break
up
and
abolish
the
inquisition
which
is
an
offence
to
humanity
and
an
unjustifiable
encroachment
on
the
rights
of
nations
the
old
man
only
smiled
and
said
mio
caro
figliuolo
napoleone
the
pope
knows
perfectly
well
folk
must
both
give
and
take
he
will
be
reasonable
and
yield
a
point
where
necessary
he
is
for
all
time
and
a
man
of
peace
bonaparte
pondered
deeply
awhile
as
though
a
series
of
quite
new
ideas
were
taking
muster
in
his
powerful
brain
then
suddenly
breaking
silence
you
do
not
realize
he
said
the
spirit
of
the
age
we
are
highly
irreligious
in
france
impiety
is
deeply
rooted
in
our
soil
you
do
not
know
the
progress
achieved
by
the
ideas
of
montesquieu
raynal
and
rousseau
public
worship
is
abolished
veneration
is
a
thing
of
the
past
you
must
have
seen
this
from
the
scandalous
talk
my
officers
indulged
in
just
now
at
your
own
table
the
good
canon
shook
his
head
ah
yes
those
fine
young
men
they
are
wild
fellows
enough
dissipated
and
reckless
it
is
only
a
passing
phase
ten
years
more
and
they
will
be
thinking
less
of
the
girls
and
more
of
going
to
mass
the
carnival
is
a
matter
of
a
few
days
and
even
this
mad
one
of
your
french
revolution
will
not
last
for
long
the
church
is
eternal
napoleon
declared
bluntly
he
cared
too
little
about
religion
himself
to
meddle
in
a
purely
ecclesiastical
matter
like
this
thereupon
the
canon
looked
him
in
the
eyes
and
told
him
my
son
i
understand
men
i
can
divine
your
nature
you
are
no
sceptic
take
up
this
case
the
blessed
father
bonaventura
case
he
will
repay
you
the
services
you
may
render
him
for
myself
i
am
over
old
to
witness
the
success
of
this
noble
enterprise
i
must
die
soon
but
knowing
it
to
be
in
your
hands
i
shall
die
happy
above
all
never
forget
my
kinsman
that
all
power
comes
of
god
by
the
instrumentality
of
his
priests
he
rose
to
his
feet
raised
his
arms
to
bless
his
young
kinsman
and
withdrew
left
alone
bonaparte
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
ponderous
memorial
by
the
smoky
light
of
his
candle
as
he
pondered
over
the
power
of
the
church
and
told
himself
the
papacy
was
a
more
enduring
institution
than
ever
the
constitution
of
the
year
iii
was
likely
to
be
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
it
was
berthier
come
to
inform
the
general
that
all
was
ready
for
their
departure
the
end
