editor
preface
in
the
case
of
those
whom
the
public
has
learned
to
honour
and
admire
there
is
a
of
the
the
phrase
is
mr
gladstone
that
is
a
matter
of
deep
interest
in
a
life
of
robert
browning
it
is
especially
true
that
the
biography
we
want
is
of
this
nature
for
its
events
are
to
be
classed
rather
among
achievements
of
the
human
spirit
than
as
objective
incidents
and
its
interest
depends
only
in
a
secondary
sense
on
circumstance
or
movement
in
the
public
eye
the
special
function
of
the
present
book
in
the
growing
library
of
browning
literature
is
to
give
such
a
biography
of
browning
mind
associating
his
poems
with
their
date
and
origin
as
may
throw
some
light
on
his
inward
development
browning
has
become
to
many
in
a
measure
which
he
could
hardly
have
conceived
possible
himself
one
of
the
authoritative
interpreters
of
the
spiritual
factors
in
human
life
his
tonic
optimism
dissipates
the
grey
atmosphere
of
materialism
which
has
obscured
the
sunclad
heights
of
life
as
effectually
as
a
fog
to
see
life
through
browning
eyes
is
to
see
it
shot
through
and
through
with
spiritual
issues
with
a
background
of
eternal
destiny
and
to
come
appreciably
nearer
than
the
general
consciousness
of
our
time
to
seeing
it
steadily
and
seeing
it
whole
those
who
prize
his
influence
know
how
to
value
everything
which
throws
light
on
the
path
by
which
he
reached
his
resolute
and
confident
outlook
it
is
almost
possible
to
count
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
the
few
men
who
could
successfully
write
a
book
of
this
character
and
scope
the
editor
believes
that
in
the
present
case
one
of
the
very
few
has
been
found
who
had
the
qualifications
required
much
of
the
apparent
obscurity
of
browning
is
due
to
his
habit
of
climbing
up
a
precipice
of
thought
and
then
kicking
away
the
ladder
by
which
he
climbed
dr
dowden
has
with
singular
success
readjusted
the
steps
so
that
readers
may
follow
the
poet
climb
those
who
are
not
daunted
by
the
paracelsus
and
sordello
chapter
where
the
subject
requires
some
close
and
patient
attention
will
find
vigorous
narrative
and
pellucid
exposition
interwoven
in
such
a
way
as
to
keep
them
in
intimate
and
constantly
closer
touch
with
the
biography
of
browning
mind
preface
an
attempt
is
made
in
this
volume
to
tell
the
story
of
browning
life
including
as
part
of
it
a
notice
of
his
books
which
may
be
regarded
as
the
chief
of
his
acts
and
all
that
he
did
i
have
tried
to
keep
my
reader
in
constant
contact
with
browning
mind
and
art
and
thus
a
sense
of
the
growth
and
development
of
his
genius
ought
to
form
itself
before
the
close
the
materials
accessible
for
a
biography
apart
from
published
writings
are
not
copious
he
destroyed
many
letters
many
no
doubt
are
in
private
hands
for
some
parts
of
his
life
i
have
been
able
to
add
little
to
what
mrs
orr
tells
but
since
her
biography
of
browning
was
published
a
good
deal
of
interesting
matter
has
appeared
the
publication
of
the
letters
of
robert
browning
and
elizabeth
barrett
browning
has
enabled
me
to
construct
a
short
narrative
of
the
incidents
that
led
up
to
browning
marriage
from
that
date
until
the
death
of
mrs
browning
her
letters
edited
by
mr
kenyon
has
been
my
chief
source
my
method
has
not
been
that
of
quotation
but
the
substance
of
many
letters
is
fused
as
far
as
was
possible
into
a
brief
continuous
story

issued
volumes

the

my
study
of
browning
poems
is
chronological
i
recognise
the
disadvantages
of
this
method
but
i
also
perceive
certain
advantages
many
years
ago
in
studies
in
literature
i
attempted
a
general
view
of
browning
work
and
wrote
as
long
ago
as
a
careful
study
of
what
i
now
write
may
suffer
as
well
as
gain
from
a
familiarity
of
so
many
years
with
his
writings
but
to
make
them
visible
objects
to
me
i
have
tried
to
put
his
poems
outside
myself
and
approach
them
with
a
fresh
mind
whether
i
have
failed
or
partly
succeeded

i
childhood
and
youth
the
ancestry
of
robert
browning
has
been
traced
to
an
earlier
robert
who
lived
in
the
service
of
sir
john
bankes
of
corfe
castle
and
died
in
his
eldest
son
thomas
was
granted
a
lease
for
three
lives
of
the
little
inn
in
the
little
hamlet
of
east
woodyates
and
parish
of
pentridge
nine
miles
of
salisbury
on
the
road
to
exeter
robert
born
in
the
son
of
this
thomas
and
grandfather
of
the
poet
became
a
clerk
in
the
bank
of
england
and
rose
to
be
principal
in
the
bank
stock
office
at
the
age
of
he
married
margaret
tittle
a
lady
born
in
the
west
indies
and
possessed
of
west
indian
property
he
is
described
by
mrs
orr
as
an
able
energetic
and
worldly
man
he
lived
until
his
grandson
was
years
old
his
first
wife
was
the
mother
of
another
robert
the
poet
father
born
in
when
the
boy
had
reached
the
age
of
seven
he
lost
his
mother
and
five
years
later
his
father
married
again
this
younger
robert
when
a
youth
desired
to
become
an
artist
but
such
a
career
was
denied
to
him
he
longed
for
a
university
education
and
through
the
influence
of
his
stepmother
this
also
was
refused
they
shipped
the
young
man
to
st
kitts
purposing
that
he
should
oversee
the
west
indian
estate
there
as
browning
on
the
authority
of
his
mother
told
miss
barrett
he
conceived
such
a
hatred
to
the
that
he
relinquished
every
prospect
supported
himself
while
there
in
some
other
capacity
and
came
back
while
yet
a
boy
to
his
father
profound
astonishment
and
rage
at
the
age
of
he
obtained
a
clerkship
in
the
bank
of
england
an
employment
which
his
son
says
he
always
detested
eight
years
later
he
married
sarah
anna
daughter
of
william
wiedemann
a
dundee
shipowner
who
was
the
son
of
a
german
merchant
of
hamburg
the
young
man
father
on
hearing
that
his
son
was
a
suitor
to
miss
wiedemann
had
waited
benevolently
on
her
uncle
to
assure
him
that
his
niece
would
be
thrown
away
on
a
man
so
evidently
born
to
be
hanged
in
the
pair
settled
in
camberwell
and
there
in
a
house
in
southampton
street
robert
browning
an
only
son
was
born
on
may
two
years
later
his
sister
sarah
anna
an
only
daughter
known
in
later
years
as
sarianna
a
form
adopted
by
her
father
was
born
she
survived
her
brother
dying
in
venice
on
the
morning
of
april
robert
browning
father
and
mother
were
persons
who
for
their
own
sakes
deserve
to
be
remembered
his
father
while
efficient
in
his
work
in
the
bank
was
a
wide
and
exact
reader
of
literature
classical
as
well
as
modern
we
are
told
by
mrs
orr
of
his
practice
of
soothing
his
little
boy
to
sleep
by
humming
to
him
an
ode
of
anacreon
and
by
dr
moncure
conway
that
he
was
versed
in
mediaeval
legend
and
seemed
to
have
known
paracelsus
faustus
and
even
talmudic
personages
with
an
intimate
familiarity
he
wrote
verses
in
excellent
couplets
of
the
eighteenth
century
manner
and
strung
together
fantastic
rhymes
as
a
mode
of
aiding
his
boy
in
tasks
which
tried
the
memory
he
was
a
dexterous
draughtsman
and
of
his
amateur
handiwork
in
portraiture
and
caricature
sometimes
produced
as
it
were
instinctively
with
a
result
that
was
unforeseen
much
remains
to
prove
his
keen
eye
and
his
skill
with
the
pencil
besides
the
curious
books
which
he
eagerly
collected
he
also
gathered
together
many
prints
those
of
hogarth
especially
and
in
early
states
he
had
a
singular
interest
such
as
may
also
be
seen
in
the
author
of
ring
and
the
in
investigating
and
elucidating
complex
criminal
cases
he
was
a
lover
of
athletic
sports
and
never
knew
for
the
accumulation
of
riches
he
had
no
talent
and
no
desire
but
he
had
a
simple
wealth
of
affection
which
he
bestowed
generously
on
his
children
and
his
friends
my
father
wrote
browning
is
to
a
fault
to
all
women
and
children
he
is
chivalrous
he
had
writes
mr
stillman
who
knew
father
in
paris
in
his
elder
years
the
perpetual
juvenility
of
a
blessed
child
if
to
live
in
the
world
as
if
not
of
it
indicates
a
saintly
nature
then
robert
browning
the
elder
was
a
saint
a
serene
untroubled
soul
conscious
of
no
moral
or
theological
problem
to
disturb
his
serenity
and
as
gentle
as
a
gentle
woman
a
man
in
whom
it
seemed
to
me
no
moral
conflict
could
ever
have
arisen
to
cloud
his
frank
acceptance
of
life
as
he
found
it
come
to
him
his
unworldliness
had
not
a
flaw
to
dante
rossetti
he
appeared
as
an
old
man
lovable
beyond
description
with
that
submissive
yet
highly
cheerful
simplicity
of
character
which
often
appears
in
the
family
of
a
great
man
who
uses
at
last
what
the
others
have
kept
for
him
he
is
rossetti
continues
a
complete
oddity
with
a
real
genius
for
drawing
but
caring
for
nothing
in
the
least
except
dutch
boors
fancy
the
father
of
browning
and
as
innocent
as
a
child
browning
himself
declared
that
he
had
not
one
artistic
taste
in
common
with
his
father
in
pictures
he
goes
away
to
brauwer
ostade
teniers
he
would
turn
from
the
sistine
to
these
in
music
he
desiderates
a
tune
has
a
story
connected
with
it
yet
browning
inherited
much
from
his
father
and
was
ready
to
acknowledge
his
gains
in
one
of
the
poems
of
his
last
volume
he
recalls
his
father
sportive
way
of
teaching
him
at
five
years
old
with
the
aid
of
chairs
and
tables
the
cat
for
helen
and
towzer
and
tray
as
the
atreidai
the
story
of
the
siege
of
troy
and
later
his
urging
the
boy
to
read
the
tale
properly
told
in
the
translation
of
homer
by
his
favourite
poet
pope
he
lived
almost
to
the
close
of
his
year
and
if
he
was
at
times
bewildered
by
his
poetry
he
came
nearer
to
it
in
intelligent
sympathy
as
he
grew
older
and
he
had
for
long
the
satisfaction
of
enjoying
his
son
fame
the
attachment
of
robert
browning
to
his
mother
the
true
type
of
a
scottish
gentlewoman
said
carlyle
was
deep
and
intimate
for
him
she
was
in
his
own
phrase
a
divine
woman
her
death
in
was
to
browning
almost
an
overwhelming
blow
she
was
of
a
nature
finely
and
delicately
strung
her
nervous
temperament
seems
to
have
been
transmitted
robust
as
he
was
in
many
ways
to
her
son
the
love
of
music
which
her
father
possessed
in
a
high
degree
leaping
over
a
generation
reappeared
in
robert
browning
his
capacity
for
intimate
friendships
with
animals
spider
and
toad
and
lizard
was
surely
an
inheritance
from
his
mother
mr
stillman
received
from
browning
sister
an
account
of
her
mother
unusual
power
over
both
wild
creatures
and
household
pets
she
could
lure
the
butterflies
in
the
garden
to
her
which
reminds
us
of
browning
whistling
for
lizards
at
asolo
a
fierce
intractable
to
all
others
to
her
was
docile
and
obedient
in
her
domestic
ways
she
was
gentle
yet
energetic
her
piety
was
deep
and
pure
her
husband
had
been
in
his
earlier
years
a
member
of
the
anglican
communion
she
was
brought
up
in
the
scottish
kirk
before
her
marriage
she
became
a
member
of
the
independent
congregation
meeting
for
worship
at
york
street
lock
fields
walworth
where
now
stands
the
robert
browning
hall
her
husband
attached
himself
to
the
same
congregation
both
were
teachers
in
the
sunday
school
mrs
browning
kept
until
within
a
few
years
of
her
death
a
missionary
box
for
contributions
to
the
london
missionary
society
the
conditions
of
membership
implied
the
acceptance
of
those
views
of
doctrinal
truth
which
for
the
sake
of
distinction
are
called
calvinistic
thus
over
the
poet
childhood
and
youth
a
religious
influence
presided
it
was
not
sacerdotal
nor
was
it
ascetic
the
boy
was
in
those
early
days
as
he
himself
declared
passionately
religious
their
excellent
pastor
was
an
entirely
unimaginative
preacher
of
the
georgian
era
who
held
fast
by
the
approved
method
of
three
heads
and
a
conclusion
browning
indifference
to
the
ministrations
of
mr
clayton
was
not
concealed
and
on
one
occasion
he
received
a
rebuke
in
the
presence
of
the
congregation
yet
the
spirit
of
religion
which
surrounded
and
penetrated
him
was
to
remain
with
him
under
all
its
modifications
to
the
end
his
face
wrote
the
rev
edward
white
is
vividly
present
to
my
memory
through
the
sixty
years
that
have
intervened
it
was
the
most
wonderful
face
in
the
whole
congregation
pale
somewhat
mysterious
and
shaded
with
black
flowing
hair
but
a
face
whose
expression
you
remember
through
a
scarcely
less
memorable
were
the
countenances
of
his
father
mother
and
sister
robert
browning
writes
mrs
orr
was
a
handsome
vigorous
fearless
child
and
soon
developed
an
unresting
activity
and
a
fiery
temper
his
energy
of
mind
made
him
a
swift
learner
after
the
elementary
lessons
in
reading
had
been
achieved
he
was
prepared
for
the
neighbouring
school
of
the
rev
thomas
ready
by
mr
ready
sisters
having
entered
this
school
as
a
he
remained
under
mr
ready
care
until
the
year
to
facile
companionship
with
his
browning
was
not
prone
but
he
found
among
them
one
or
two
abiding
friends
as
for
the
rest
though
he
was
no
winner
of
school
prizes
he
seems
to
have
acquired
a
certain
intellectual
mastery
over
his
comrades
some
of
them
were
formed
into
a
dramatic
for
the
performance
of
his
boyish
plays
perhaps
the
better
part
of
his
education
was
that
of
his
hours
at
home
he
read
widely
in
his
father
excellent
library
the
favourite
books
of
his
earliest
years
croxall
and
quarles
were
succeeded
by
others
which
made
a
substantial
contribution
to
his
mind
a
list
given
by
mrs
orr
includes
walpole
junius
voltaire
and
mandeville
of
the
the
first
book
he
ever
bought
with
his
own
money
was
macpherson
and
the
first
composition
he
committed
to
paper
written
years
before
his
purchase
of
the
volume
was
an
imitation
of
ossian
whom
says
browning
i
had
not
read
but
conceived
through
two
or
three
scraps
in
other
books
his
early
feeling
for
art
was
nourished
by
visits
to
the
dulwich
gallery
to
which
he
obtained
an
entrance
when
far
under
the
age
permitted
by
the
rules
there
he
would
sit
for
an
hour
before
some
chosen
picture
and
in
later
years
he
could
recall
the
wonderful
rembrandt
of
jacob
vision
the
giorgione
the
triumphant
murillo
pictures
such
a
watteau
and
all
the
poussins
among
modern
poets
byron
at
first
with
him
held
the
chief
place
boyish
verses
written
under
the
byronic
influence
were
gathered
into
a
group
when
the
writer
was
but
twelve
years
old
a
title
was
found
and
browning
parents
had
serious
intentions
of
publishing
the
manuscript
happily
the
manuscript
declined
by
publishers
was
in
the
end
destroyed
and
editors
have
been
saved
from
the
necessity
of
printing
or
reprinting
these
crudities
of
a
great
poet
childhood
their
only
merit
he
assured
mr
gosse
lay
in
their
mellifluous
smoothness
it
was
an
event
of
capital
importance
in
the
history
of
browning
mind
when
probably
in
his
thirteenth
year
he
lighted
in
exploring
a
upon
a
copy
of
one
of
the
pirated
editions
of
shelley
and
other
poems
through
the
zeal
of
his
good
mother
on
the
boy
behalf
the
authorised
editions
were
at
a
later
time
obtained
and
she
added
to
her
gift
the
works
as
far
as
they
were
then
in
print
of
keats
if
ever
there
was
a
period
of
und
in
browning
life
it
was
during
the
years
in
which
he
caught
from
shelley
the
spirit
of
the
higher
revolt
a
new
faith
and
unfaith
came
to
him
radiant
with
colour
luminous
with
the
brightness
of
dawn
and
uttered
with
a
new
keen
penetrating
melody
the
outward
conduct
of
his
life
was
obedient
in
all
essentials
to
the
good
laws
of
use
and
wont
he
pursued
his
various
studies
literature
languages
music
with
energy
he
was
diligent
during
a
brief
attendance
in
professor
long
greek
class
at
university
college
a
bright
handsome
youth
as
a
classfellow
has
described
him
with
long
black
hair
falling
over
his
shoulders
he
sang
he
danced
he
rode
he
boxed
he
fenced
but
below
all
these
activities
a
restless
inward
current
ran
for
a
time
he
became
as
mrs
orr
has
put
it
a
professing
atheist
and
a
practising
vegetarian
and
together
with
the
of
intellectual
independence
there
was
present
a
certain
aggressive
egoism
he
loved
his
home
yet
he
chafed
against
some
of
its
social
limitations
of
friendships
outside
his
home
we
read
of
that
with
alfred
domett
the
of
his
poems
afterwards
the
poet
and
the
statesman
of
new
zealand
with
joseph
arnould
afterwards
the
indian
judge
and
with
his
cousin
james
silverthorne
the
of
browning
pathetic
poem
and
we
hear
also
of
a
tender
boyish
sentiment
settling
into
friendship
for
miss
eliza
flower
his
senior
by
nine
years
for
whose
musical
compositions
he
had
an
ardent
admiration
i
put
it
apart
from
all
other
english
music
i
know
he
wrote
as
late
as
and
fully
believe
in
it
as
music
we
all
waited
for
with
her
sister
sarah
two
years
younger
than
eliza
best
known
by
her
married
name
sarah
flower
adams
and
remembered
by
her
hymn
written
in
nearer
my
god
to
thee
he
discussed
as
a
boy
his
religious
difficulties
and
in
proposing
his
own
doubts
drew
forth
her
latent
scepticism
as
to
the
orthodox
beliefs
it
was
in
answering
robert
browning
she
wrote
that
my
mind
refused
to
bring
forward
argument
turned
recreant
and
sided
with
the
enemy
something
of
this
period
of
browning
und
can
be
divined
through
the
ideas
and
imagery
of
the
finer
influence
of
shelley
upon
the
genius
of
browning
in
his
youth
proceeded
from
something
quite
other
than
those
doctrinaire
abstractions
the
formulas
of
revolution
which
shelley
had
caught
up
from
godwin
and
certain
french
thinkers
of
the
eighteenth
century
browning
spirit
from
first
to
last
was
one
which
was
constantly
reaching
upward
through
the
attainments
of
earth
to
something
that
lay
beyond
them
a
climbing
spirit
such
as
his
seemed
to
perceive
in
shelley
a
spirit
that
not
only
climbed
but
soared
he
could
in
those
early
days
have
addressed
to
shelley
words
written
later
and
suggested
one
can
not
but
believe
by
his
feeling
for
his
wife
you
must
be
just
before
in
fine
see
and
make
me
see
for
your
part
new
depths
of
the
divine
shelley
opened
up
for
his
young
and
enthusiastic
follower
new
vistas
leading
towards
the
infinite
towards
the
unattainable
best
only
piece
of
prose
criticism
apart
from
scattered
comments
in
his
letters
is
the
essay
introductory
to
that
volume
of
letters
erroneously
ascribed
to
shelley
which
was
published
when
browning
was
but
little
under
forty
years
old
it
expresses
his
mature
feelings
and
convictions
and
these
doubtless
contain
within
them
as
their
germ
the
experience
of
his
youth
shelley
appears
to
him
as
a
poet
gifted
with
a
fuller
perception
of
nature
and
man
than
that
of
the
average
mind
and
striving
to
embody
the
thing
he
perceives
not
so
much
with
reference
to
the
many
below
as
to
the
one
above
him
the
supreme
intelligence
which
apprehends
all
things
in
their
absolute
truth
an
ultimate
view
ever
aspired
to
if
but
partially
attained
by
the
poet
own
soul
if
shelley
was
deficient
in
some
subordinate
powers
which
support
and
reinforce
the
purely
poetic
gifts
he
possessed
the
highest
faculty
and
in
this
he
lived
and
had
his
being
his
spirit
invariably
saw
and
spoke
from
the
last
height
to
which
it
had
attained
what
was
his
noblest
and
predominating
characteristic
as
a
poet
browning
attempts
to
give
it
definition
it
was
his
simultaneous
perception
of
power
and
love
in
the
absolute
and
of
beauty
and
good
in
the
concrete
while
he
throws
from
his
poet
station
between
both
swifter
subtler
and
more
numerous
films
for
the
connexion
of
each
with
each
than
have
been
thrown
by
any
modern
artificer
of
whom
i
have
knowledge
in
other
words
it
was
shelley
special
function
to
fling
an
aerial
bridge
from
reality
as
we
commonly
understand
that
word
to
the
higher
reality
which
we
name
the
ideal
to
set
up
an
aerial
ladder
not
less
solid
because
it
is
aerial
upon
the
earth
whose
top
reached
to
heaven
such
was
browning
conception
of
shelley
and
it
pays
little
regard
either
to
atheistic
theory
or
vegetarian
practice
a
time
came
when
robert
browning
must
make
choice
of
a
future
career
his
interests
in
life
were
manifold
but
in
some
form
or
another
art
was
the
predominant
interest
his
father
remembered
his
own
early
inclinations
and
how
they
had
been
thwarted
he
recognised
the
rare
gifts
of
his
son
and
he
resolved
that
he
should
not
be
immured
in
the
office
of
a
bank
should
he
plead
at
the
bar
should
he
paint
should
he
be
a
maker
of
music
as
he
at
one
time
desired
and
for
music
he
always
possessed
an
exceptional
talent
when
his
father
spoke
to
him
robert
browning
knew
that
his
sister
was
not
dependent
on
any
effort
of
his
to
provide
the
means
of
living
he
appealed
writes
mr
gosse
to
his
father
whether
it
would
not
be
better
for
him
to
see
life
in
the
best
sense
and
cultivate
the
powers
of
his
mind
than
to
shackle
himself
in
the
very
outset
of
his
career
by
a
laborious
training
foreign
to
that
aim
so
great
was
the
confidence
of
the
father
in
the
genius
of
his
son
that
the
former
at
once
acquiesced
in
the
proposal
it
was
decided
that
he
should
take
to
what
an
old
woman
of
the
lake
district
speaking
of
mr
wudsworth
described
as
the
poetry
business
the
believing
father
was
even
prepared
to
invest
some
capital
in
the
concern
at
his
expense
and
and
were
published
a
poet
may
make
his
entrance
into
literature
with
small
or
large
inventions
by
carving
or
carving
a
colossus
browning
the
creator
of
men
and
women
the
fashioner
of
minds
would
be
a
sculptor
of
figures
more
than
rather
than
an
exquisite
jeweller
the
attempt
at
a
perseus
of
this
cellini
was
to
precede
his
brooches
and
buttons
he
planned
mr
gosse
tells
us
a
series
of
monodramatic
epics
narratives
of
the
life
of
typical
souls
in
a
modification
of
this
vast
scheme
which
includes
more
speakers
than
one
and
which
is
not
dramatic
in
form
find
their
places
they
were
preceded
by
in
the
strictest
sense
a
monodrama
a
poem
not
less
large
in
conception
than
either
of
the
others
though
this
fragment
of
a
confession
is
wrought
out
on
a
more
contracted
scale
published
without
the
writer
name
his
aunt
silverthorne
bearing
the
cost
of
publication
was
issued
from
the
press
in
january
browning
had
not
yet
completed
his
year
when
including
it
among
his
poetical
works
in
he
declared
that
he
did
so
with
extreme
repugnance
and
solely
with
a
view
to
anticipate
unauthorised
republication
of
what
was
no
more
than
a
crude
preliminary
sketch
entirely
lacking
in
good
draughtsmanship
and
right
handling
for
the
edition
of
twenty
years
later
he
revised
and
corrected
without
it
to
any
considerable
extent
in
truth
is
a
poem
from
which
browning
ought
not
to
have
desired
to
detach
his
mature
self
rarely
does
a
poem
by
a
writer
so
young
deserve
better
to
be
read
for
its
own
sake
it
is
an
interesting
document
in
the
history
of
its
author
mind
it
gives
promises
and
pledges
which
were
redeemed
in
full
it
shows
what
dropped
away
from
the
poet
and
what
being
an
essential
part
of
his
equipment
was
retained
it
exhibits
his
artistic
method
in
the
process
of
formation
it
sets
forth
certain
leading
thoughts
which
are
dominant
in
his
later
work
the
first
considerable
production
of
a
great
writer
must
always
claim
attention
from
the
student
of
his
mind
and
art
the
poem
is
a
study
in
what
browning
in
his
terms
mental
analysis
it
attempts
to
shadow
forth
through
the
fluctuating
moods
of
the
dying
man
a
series
of
spiritual
states
the
psychology
is
sometimes
crude
subtle
but
clumsily
subtle
it
is
however
essentially
the
writer
own
to
construe
clearly
the
states
of
mind
which
are
adumbrated
rather
than
depicted
is
difficult
for
browning
had
not
yet
learnt
to
manifest
his
generalised
conceptions
through
concrete
details
to
plunge
his
abstractions
in
reality
the
speaker
in
the
poem
tells
us
that
he
rudely
shaped
his
life
to
his
immediate
wants
this
is
intelligible
yet
only
vaguely
intelligible
for
we
do
not
know
what
were
these
wants
and
we
do
not
see
any
rude
shaping
of
his
life
we
are
told
of
deeds
for
which
remorse
were
vain
what
were
these
deeds
did
he
like
bunyan
play
cat
on
sunday
or
join
the
ringers
of
the
church
bells
instance
instance
we
cry
impatiently
and
so
the
story
remains
half
a
shadow
the
poem
is
dramatic
yet
like
so
much
of
browning
work
it
is
not
pure
drama
coming
from
profound
sympathy
with
a
spirit
other
than
the
writer
own
it
is
only
hybrid
drama
in
which
the
thinks
and
moves
and
acts
under
the
necessity
of
expounding
certain
ideas
of
the
poet
browning
puppets
are
indeed
too
often
in
his
earlier
poems
moved
by
intellectual
wires
the
hands
are
the
hands
of
luria
or
djabal
but
the
voice
is
the
showman
voice
a
certain
intemperance
in
the
pursuit
of
poetic
beauty
strange
and
lovely
imagery
which
obscures
rather
than
interprets
may
be
regarded
as
in
the
fault
or
the
glory
of
youth
a
young
heir
arrived
at
his
inheritance
will
scatter
gold
pieces
the
verse
has
caught
something
of
its
affluent
flow
its
wavelike
career
wave
advancing
upon
wave
from
shelley
is
he
i
ken
the
manner
of
his
gait
he
rises
on
the
toe
that
spirit
of
his
in
aspiration
lifts
him
from
the
earth
the
aspiration
in
browning
later
verse
is
a
complex
of
many
forces
here
it
is
a
simple
poetic
enthusiasm
by
virtue
of
its
central
theme
is
closely
related
to
the
poems
which
at
no
great
distance
followed
and
each
is
a
study
of
the
flaws
which
bring
genius
to
all
but
ruin
a
study
of
the
erroneous
conduct
of
life
by
men
of
extraordinary
powers
in
each
poem
the
chief
personage
aspires
and
fails
yet
rises
for
browning
was
not
of
the
temper
to
accept
ultimate
failures
and
postulated
a
heaven
to
warrant
his
optimistic
creed
rises
at
the
close
from
failure
to
a
spiritual
recovery
which
may
be
regarded
as
attainment
but
an
attainment
as
far
as
earth
and
its
uses
are
concerned
marred
and
piteous
he
recovers
in
the
end
his
true
direction
but
recovers
it
only
for
service
in
worlds
other
than
ours
which
he
may
hereafter
traverse
he
has
been
seduced
or
conquered
by
alien
forces
and
through
some
inward
flaw
he
has
been
faithless
to
his
highest
faculties
he
has
not
fulfilled
his
seeming
destiny
yet
before
death
and
the
darkness
of
death
arrive
light
has
come
he
perceives
the
wanderings
of
the
way
and
in
one
supreme
hour
or
in
one
shining
moment
he
gives
indefeasible
pledges
of
the
loyalty
which
he
has
forfeited
shelley
in
the
influence
of
which
on
browning
in
writing
is
evident
had
rebuked
the
idealist
within
himself
who
would
live
in
lofty
abstractions
to
the
loss
of
human
sympathy
and
human
love
browning
in
also
recognises
this
danger
but
he
indicates
others
the
risk
of
the
lower
faculties
of
the
mind
encroaching
upon
and
even
displacing
the
higher
the
risk
of
the
spirit
of
aggrandisement
even
in
the
world
of
the
imagination
obtaining
the
mastery
over
the
spirit
of
surrender
to
that
which
is
higher
than
self
it
is
quite
right
and
needful
to
speak
of
the
lesson
of
browning
poem
and
the
lesson
of
is
designed
to
inculcate
first
loyalty
to
a
man
highest
power
and
secondly
a
worshipping
loyalty
and
service
to
that
which
transcends
himself
named
by
the
speaker
in
by
the
old
and
simple
name
of
god
was
it
the
problem
of
his
own
life
that
concerning
the
conduct
of
high
intellectual
and
spiritual
powers
which
browning
transferred
to
his
art
creating
personages
other
than
himself
to
be
exponents
of
his
theme
we
can
not
tell
but
the
problem
in
varied
forms
persists
from
poem
to
poem
the
poet
imagined
as
twenty
years
of
age
who
makes
his
fragment
of
a
confession
in
is
more
than
a
poet
he
is
rather
of
the
sordello
type
than
of
the
type
represented
in
eglamor
and
aprile
through
his
imagination
he
would
comprehend
and
possess
all
forms
of
life
of
beauty
of
joy
in
nature
and
in
humanity
but
he
must
also
feel
himself
at
the
centre
of
these
the
lord
and
master
of
his
own
perceptions
and
creations
and
yet
at
the
same
time
this
man
is
made
for
the
worship
and
service
of
a
power
higher
than
self
how
is
such
a
nature
as
this
to
attain
its
true
ends
what
are
its
special
dangers
if
he
content
himself
with
the
exercise
of
the
subordinate
faculties
intellectual
dexterity
wit
social
charm
and
mastery
he
is
lost
if
he
should
place
himself
at
the
summit
and
cease
to
worship
and
to
love
he
is
lost
he
can
not
alter
his
own
nature
he
can
not
ever
renounce
his
intense
consciousness
of
self
nor
even
the
claim
of
self
to
a
certain
supremacy
as
the
centre
of
its
own
sympathies
and
imaginings
so
much
is
inevitable
and
is
right
but
if
he
be
true
to
his
calling
as
poet
he
will
task
his
noblest
faculty
will
live
in
it
and
none
the
less
look
upward
in
love
in
humility
in
the
spirit
of
loyal
service
in
the
spirit
of
glad
aspiration
to
that
power
which
leans
above
him
and
has
set
him
his
earthly
task
such
reduced
to
a
colourless
and
abstract
statement
is
the
theme
dealt
with
in
the
young
poet
who
through
a
fading
autumn
evening
lies
upon
his
has
been
faithless
to
his
high
calling
and
yet
never
wholly
faithless
as
the
pallid
light
declines
he
studies
his
own
soul
he
reviews
his
past
he
traces
his
wanderings
from
the
way
and
all
has
become
clear
he
has
failed
for
the
uses
of
earth
but
he
recognises
in
himself
capacities
and
desires
for
which
no
adequate
scope
could
ever
have
been
found
in
this
life
and
restored
to
the
spirit
of
love
of
trust
by
such
love
such
trust
as
he
can
give
pauline
he
can
not
deny
the
witnessing
audible
within
his
own
heart
to
a
future
life
which
may
redeem
the
balance
of
his
temporal
loss
the
thought
which
plays
so
large
a
part
in
browning
later
poetry
is
already
present
and
potent
here
two
incidents
in
the
history
of
a
soul
studied
by
the
speaker
under
the
wavering
lights
of
his
hectic
malady
and
fluctuating
moods
of
passion
are
dealt
with
in
a
singularly
interesting
and
original
way
he
describes
with
strange
and
beautiful
imagery
the
cynical
bitter
pleasure
few
of
us
do
not
know
it
which
the
intellectual
faculties
sometimes
derive
from
mocking
and
drawing
down
to
their
own
level
the
spiritual
powers
the
intuitive
powers
which
are
higher
than
they
higher
yet
less
capable
of
justification
or
verification
by
the
common
tests
of
sense
and
understanding
the
witchcraft
of
the
brain
degrades
the
god
in
us
and
then
i
was
a
young
witch
whose
blue
eyes
as
she
stood
naked
by
the
river
springs
drew
down
a
god
i
watched
his
radiant
form
growing
less
radiant
and
it
gladdened
me
what
he
presents
with
such
intensity
of
imaginative
power
browning
must
have
known
even
if
it
were
but
for
moments
by
experience
and
again
there
is
impressive
truth
and
originality
in
the
description
of
the
state
of
the
poet
mind
which
succeeded
the
wreck
of
his
early
faith
and
early
hopes
inspired
by
the
voice
of
shelley
the
revolutionary
faith
in
liberty
equality
and
human
perfectibility
wordsworth
in
unpublished
when
browning
wrote
which
is
also
the
history
of
a
poet
mind
has
described
his
own
experience
of
the
loss
of
all
these
shining
hopes
and
lofty
abstractions
and
the
temper
of
mind
which
he
describes
is
one
of
moral
chaos
and
spiritual
despair
the
poet
of
turns
from
political
and
social
abstractions
to
real
life
and
the
touch
of
reality
awakens
him
as
if
from
a
splendid
dream
but
his
mood
is
not
so
sane
as
that
of
despair
he
falls
back
with
a
certain
joy
upon
the
exercise
of
his
inferior
powers
he
wakes
suddenly
and
without
first
went
my
hopes
of
perfecting
mankind
next
faith
in
them
and
then
in
freedom
self
and
virtue
self
then
my
own
motives
ends
and
aims
and
loves
and
human
love
went
last
i
felt
this
no
decay
because
new
powers
rose
as
old
feelings
left
wit
mockery
for
i
had
oft
been
sad
mistrusting
my
resolves
but
now
i
cast
hope
joyously
away
i
laughed
and
said
no
more
of
this
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
browning
is
wholly
dramatic
here
we
seem
to
discover
something
of
that
period
of
und
when
his
mood
grew
restless
and
aggressive
the
homage
paid
to
shelley
whose
higher
influence
browning
already
perceived
to
be
in
large
measure
independent
of
his
creed
of
revolution
has
in
it
certainly
something
of
the
spirit
of
autobiography
in
this
enthusiastic
admiration
for
shelley
there
is
nothing
to
regret
except
the
unhappy
extravagance
of
the
name
suntreader
which
he
invented
as
a
title
for
the
poet
of
and
the
attention
of
mr
fox

unitarian

browning

it
found
few
readers
but
the
admiration
of
one
of
these
who
discovered
many
years
later
was
a
sufficient
compensation
for
the
general
indifference
or
neglect
when
mr
browning
was
living
in
florence
he
received
a
letter
from
a
young
painter
whose
name
was
quite
unknown
to
him
asking
him
whether
he
were
the
author
of

was
somewhat
in

manner

greatly
admired

it

on

and
booths
and
droshkies
and
and
so
forth
with
the
palaces
in
the
background
late
in
life
at
venice
browning
became
acquainted
with
an
old
russian
prince
gagarin
with
whom
he
competed
successfully
for
an
hour
in
recalling
and
national
airs
of
russia
caught
up
during
the
visit
of
his
memory
said
gagarin
is
better
than
my
own
on
which
i
have
hitherto
piqued
myself
not
a
little
perhaps
it
was
his
wanderings
abroad
that
made
browning
at
this
time
desire
further
wanderings
he
thought
of
a
diplomatic
career
and
felt
some
regret
when
he
failed
to
obtain
an
appointment
for
which
he
had
applied
in
connection
with
a
mission
to
persia
in
the
winter
of
browning
was
at
work
on
which
after
disappointments
with
other
houses
was
accepted
on
terms
that
secured
the
publisher
from
risk
by
effingham
wilson
and
appeared
before
midsummer
of
the
following
year
the
subject
had
been
suggested
by
count
am√©d√©e
de
a
young
french
royalist
engaged
in
secret
service
on
behalf
of
the
dethroned
bourbons
to
him
the
poem
is
dedicated
for
a
befitting
treatment
of
the
story
of
paracelsus
special
studies
were
necessary
and
browning
entered
into
these
with
zeal
taking
in
his
poem
as
he
himself
believed
only
trifling
liberties
with
the
matter
of
history
in
solitary
midnight
walks
he
meditated
his
theme
and
its
development
there
was
in
particular
mr
sharp
tells
us
a
wood
near
dulwich
whither
he
was
wont
to
go
mr
sharp
adds
that
at
this
time
browning
composed
much
in
the
open
air
and
that
the
glow
of
distant
london
at
night
with
the
thought
of
its
multitudinous
human
life
was
an
inspiring
influence
the
sea
which
spoke
to
browning
with
most
expressive
utterances
was
always
the
sea
of
humanity
in
its
combination
of
thought
with
passion
and
not
less
in
its
expression
of
a
certain
premature
worldly
wisdom
is
an
extraordinary
output
of
mind
made
by
a
writer
who
when
his
work
was
accomplished
had
not
completed
his
year
the
poem
is
the
history
of
a
great
spirit
who
has
sought
lofty
and
unattainable
ends
who
has
fallen
upon
the
way
and
is
bruised
and
broken
but
who
rises
at
the
close
above
his
ruined
self
and
wrings
out
of
defeat
a
pledge
of
ultimate
victory
in
a
preface
to
the
first
edition
a
preface
afterwards
omitted
browning
claims
originality
or
at
least
novelty
for
his
artistic
method
instead
of
having
recourse
to
an
external
machinery
of
incidents
to
create
and
evolve
the
crisis
i
desire
to
produce
i
have
ventured
to
display
somewhat
minutely
the
mood
itself
in
its
rise
and
progress
and
have
suffered
the
agency
by
which
it
is
influenced
and
determined
to
be
generally
discernible
in
its
effects
alone
and
subordinate
throughout
if
not
altogether
excluded
the
poem
though
dramatic
is
not
a
drama
and
canons
which
are
applicable
to
a
piece
intended
for
would
here
browning
pleads
be
rather
a
hindrance
than
a
help
perhaps
browning
regarded
the
action
which
can
be
exhibited
on
the
stage
as
something
external
to
the
soul
and
imagined
that
the
naked
spirit
can
be
viewed
more
intimately
than
the
spirit
clothed
in
deed
and
in
circumstance
if
this
was
so
his
conceptions
were
somewhat
crude
with
the
true
dramatic
poet
action
is
the
hieroglyph
of
the
soul
and
many
a
secret
may
be
revealed
in
this
language
amassing
as
it
does
large
meanings
into
one
luminous
symbol
which
can
not
be
set
forth
in
an
elaborate
intellectual
analysis
we
think
to
probe
the
depths
and
perhaps
never
get
far
below
the
surface
but
the
flash
and
outbreak
of
a
fiery
spirit
amid
a
tangle
of
circumstance
springs
to
the
surface
from
the
very
centre
and
reveals
its
inmost
energies
paracelsus
as
presented
in
the
poem
is
a
man
of
genius
passionate
intellect
and
inordinate
intellectual
ambition
if
it
is
meant
that
he
should
be
the
type
of
the
modern
man
of
science
browning
has
missed
his
mark
for
paracelsus
is
in
fact
almost
as
much
the
poet
as
the
man
of
science
but
it
is
true
that
the
cautious
habits
of
the
inductive
student
of
nature
were
rare
among
the
enthusiastic
speculators
of
renaissance
days
and
the
italian
successor
of
paracelsus
giordano
bruno
was
in
reality
in
large
measure
what
browning
has
here
conceived
and
exhibited
paracelsus
is
a
great
revolutionary
spirit
in
an
epoch
of
intellectual
revolution
it
is
as
much
his
task
to
destroy
as
to
build
up
he
has
broken
with
the
past
and
gazes
with
hopes
into
the
future
expecting
the
era
of
intellectual
liberty
to
dawn
suddenly
with
the
year
one
and
seeing
in
himself
the
protagonist
of
revolution
such
men
as
paracelsus
whether
their
sphere
be
in
the
political
the
religious
or
the
intellectual
world
are
men
of
faith
a
task
has
been
laid
on
each
of
them
a
summons
a
divine
mandate
has
been
heard
but
is
the
summons
authentic
is
the
mandate
indeed
divine
in
the
quiet
garden
at
w√ºrzburg
while
the
autumn
sun
sinks
behind
st
saviour
spire
festus
the
faithful
horatio
to
this
hamlet
of
science
puts
his
questions
and
raises
his
doubts
first
as
to
the
end
and
aim
of
paracelsus
his
aspiration
towards
absolute
knowledge
and
secondly
as
to
the
means
proposed
for
its
attainment
means
which
reject
the
service
of
all
predecessors
in
the
paths
of
knowledge
which
depart
so
widely
from
the
methods
of
his
contemporaries
which
seek
for
truth
through
strange
and
casual
revelations
which
leave
so
much
to
chance
very
nobly
has
browning
represented
the
overmastering
force
of
that
faith
which
genius
has
in
itself
and
which
indeed
is
needed
to
sustain
it
in
the
struggle
with
an
incredulous
or
indifferent
world
the
end
itself
is
justified
by
the
mandate
of
god
and
as
for
the
means
truth
is
not
to
be
found
only
or
chiefly
by
gathering
up
stray
fragments
from
without
truth
lies
buried
within
the
soul
as
jewels
in
the
mine
and
the
chances
and
changes
and
shocks
of
life
are
required
to
open
a
passage
for
the
shining
forth
of
this
inner
light
festus
is
overpowered
less
by
reason
than
by
the
passion
of
faith
in
his
younger
and
greater
and
the
gentle
michal
is
won
from
her
prophetic
fears
half
by
her
affectionate
loyalty
to
the
man
half
by
the
glow
and
inspiration
of
one
who
seems
to
be
a
surer
prophet
than
her
mistrusting
self
and
in
truth
the
summons
to
paracelsus
is
authentic
he
is
to
be
a
in
the
race
his
errors
are
his
own
errors
of
the
egoism
of
genius
in
an
age
of
intellectual
revolution
he
casts
away
the
past
and
that
is
not
wise
that
is
not
legitimate
he
anticipates
for
himself
the
full
attainment
of
knowledge
which
belongs
not
to
him
but
to
humanity
during
revolving
centuries
and
although
he
sets
before
himself
the
service
of
man
as
the
outcome
of
all
his
labours
and
this
is
well
at
the
same
time
he
detaches
himself
from
his
regards
them
from
a
regal
height
would
decline
even
their
tribute
of
gratitude
and
would
be
the
lofty
benefactor
rather
than
the
loving
helpmate
of
his
brethren
is
it
meant
then
that
paracelsus
ought
to
have
contented
himself
with
being
like
his
teacher
trithemius
and
the
common
masters
of
the
schools
no
for
these
rested
with
an
easy
in
their
poor
attainments
and
he
is
called
upon
to
press
forward
and
advance
from
strength
to
strength
through
attainment
or
through
failure
to
renewed
and
unending
endeavour
his
dissatisfaction
his
failure
is
a
better
thing
than
their
success
and
content
in
that
success
but
why
should
he
hope
in
his
own
person
to
forestall
the
slow
advance
of
humanity
and
why
should
the
service
of
the
brain
be
alienated
from
the
service
of
the
heart
there
are
many
ways
in
which
browning
could
have
brought
paracelsus
to
a
discovery
of
his
error
he
might
have
learnt
from
his
own
experience
the
aridity
of
a
life
which
is
barren
of
love
some
moment
of
supreme
pity
might
have
come
to
him
in
which
he
the
possessor
of
knowledge
might
have
longed
to
offer
consolation
to
some
suffering
fellow
and
have
found
the
helplessness
of
knowledge
to
console
browning
imagination
as
a
romantic
poet
craved
a
romantic
incident
and
a
romantic
in
the
house
of
the
greek
conjuror
at
constantinople
paracelsus
now
worn
by
his
nine
years
wanderings
with
all
their
stress
and
strain
his
hair
already
streaked
with
grey
his
spirit
somewhat
embittered
by
the
small
success
attending
a
vast
effort
his
moral
nature
already
somewhat
deteriorated
and
touched
with
the
cynicism
of
experience
and
partial
failure
shall
encounter
the
strange
figure
of
aprile
the
living
wraith
of
a
poet
who
has
also
failed
who
would
love
infinitely
and
be
loved
and
who
in
gazing
upon
the
end
has
neglected
all
the
means
of
attainment
and
from
him
or
rather
by
a
reflex
ray
from
this
aprile
his
own
error
shall
be
flashed
on
the
consciousness
of
the
foiled
seeker
for
knowledge
the
invention
of
browning
is
certainly
not
lacking
in
the
quality
of
strangeness
in
beauty
yet
some
readers
will
perhaps
share
the
feeling
that
it
strains
without
convincing
the
imagination
as
we
read
the
first
speeches
addressed
by
the
poet
to
the
wandering
student
of
science
and
read
the
replies
notwithstanding
the
singular
beauty
of
certain
dramatic
and
lyrical
passages
we
are
inclined
to
ask
is
this
indeed
a
house
at
constantinople
or
one
of
browning
cells
and
from
what
delusions
are
the
harmless
and
the
apparently
dangerous
lunatic
suffering
the
lover
here
is
typified
in
the
artist
but
the
artist
may
be
as
haughtily
isolated
from
true
human
love
as
the
man
of
science
and
the
fellowship
with
his
kind
which
paracelsus
needs
can
be
poorly
learnt
from
such
a
distracted
creature
as
aprile
it
is
indeed
aprile
example
and
the
fate
which
has
overtaken
him
rather
than
his
wild
words
which
startle
paracelsus
into
a
recognition
of
his
own
error
but
the
knowledge
that
he
has
left
love
out
of
his
scheme
of
life
is
no
guarantee
that
he
will
ever
acquire
the
fervour
and
the
infinite
patience
of
love
the
whole
scene
with
its
extravagant
poetic
beauties
and
rhetoric
leaves
a
painful
impression
of
unreality
not
in
the
shallower
but
in
the
deepest
sense
of
that
word
for
a
poet
to
depict
a
poet
in
poetry
is
a
hazardous
experiment
in
regarding
one
own
trade
a
sense
of
humour
and
a
little
wholesome
cynicism
are
not
amiss
these
could
find
no
place
in
presentation
of
aprile
but
it
is
certain
that
browning
himself
was
a
much
more
complex
person
than
the
dying
lover
of
love
who
became
the
instructor
of
paracelsus
when
the
scene
shifts
from
constantinople
to
basil
and
the
illustrious
professor
holds
converse
with
festus
by
the
blazing
logs
deep
into
the
night
and
at
length
morning
arises
clouded
wintry
desolate
and
cold
we
listen
with
unflagging
attention
and
entire
imaginative
conviction
and
when
silence
ensues
a
wonder
comes
upon
us
as
to
where
a
young
man
of
acquired
this
knowledge
of
the
various
bitter
tastes
of
life
which
belong
to
maturer
experience
and
how
he
had
mastered
such
precocious
worldly
wisdom
paracelsus
the
wondrous
paracelsus
life
dispenser
fate
commissary
idol
of
the
schools
and
courts
chews
upon
his
worldly
success
and
extracts
its
acrid
juices
this
is
not
the
romantic
melancholy
of
youth
which
dreams
of
infinite
things
but
the
pain
of
manhood
which
feels
the
limitations
of
life
which
can
laugh
at
the
mockery
of
attainment
which
is
sensible
of
the
shame
that
dwells
at
the
heart
of
glory
yet
which
already
has
begun
to
hanker
after
the
mean
delights
of
the
world
and
can
not
dispense
with
the
sorry
pleasures
of
the
kind
calm
pastor
of
einsiedeln
sees
at
first
only
the
splendour
that
hangs
around
the
name
of
his
early
comrade
the
hero
of
his
hopes
and
paracelsus
for
a
while
would
forbear
with
tender
ruth
to
shatter
his
friend
illusion
would
veil
if
that
were
possible
the
canker
which
has
eaten
into
his
own
heart
but
in
the
tumult
of
old
glad
memories
and
present
griefs
it
ceases
to
be
possible
from
amid
the
crew
of
foolish
praisers
he
must
find
one
friend
having
the
fidelity
of
genuine
insight
he
must
confess
his
failure
and
once
for
all
correct
the
prophecy
of
michal
that
success
would
come
and
with
it
wretchedness
i
have
not
been
successful
and
yet
am
most
miserable
is
said
at
last
a
certain
manly
protectiveness
towards
festus
and
michal
with
their
happy
aennchen
and
aureole
in
the
quiet
home
at
einsiedeln
remains
to
paracelsus
there
is
in
it
now
more
than
a
touch
of
the
devotion
to
something
afar
from
the
sphere
of
our
sorrow
when
driven
from
basil
as
a
quack
amid
the
hootings
of
the
crowd
paracelsus
once
again
aspires
but
it
is
from
a
lower
level
with
energy
less
certain
and
with
a
more
turbid
passion
upon
such
soiled
and
draggled
wings
can
he
ever
soar
again
his
strength
is
the
strength
of
fever
his
gaiety
is
wild
and
bitter
he
urges
his
brain
with
artificial
stimulants
and
he
whose
need
was
love
has
learnt
hatred
and
scorn
in
his
earlier
quest
for
truth
he
had
parted
with
youth
and
joy
he
had
grown
and
before
the
time
now
in
his
new
scheme
of
life
he
will
not
sever
truth
from
enjoyment
he
will
snatch
at
the
meanest
delights
before
death
comes
something
at
least
shall
thus
be
gained
and
yet
he
has
almost
lost
the
capacity
for
pleasures
apart
from
those
of
a
wolfish
hunger
for
knowledge
and
he
despises
his
baser
aims
and
his
extravagant
speeches
could
life
only
be
begun
anew
with
temperate
hopes
and
sane
aspirings
but
he
has
given
his
pledges
and
will
abide
by
them
he
must
submit
to
be
hunted
by
the
gods
to
the
end
before
he
parts
from
festus
at
the
alsatian
inn
a
softer
mood
overtakes
him
blinded
by
his
own
passion
paracelsus
has
had
no
sense
to
divine
the
sorrow
of
his
friend
and
festus
has
had
no
heart
to
obtrude
such
a
sorrow
as
this
only
at
the
last
moment
and
in
all
gentleness
it
must
be
told
michal
is
dead
in
browning
earliest
poem
pauline
is
no
more
than
a
name
and
a
shadow
the
creator
of
ottima
and
colombe
of
balaustion
and
pompilia
had
much
to
tell
of
womanhood
michal
occupies
as
is
right
but
a
small
space
in
the
history
of
paracelsus
yet
her
presence
in
the
poem
and
her
silent
withdrawal
have
a
poignant
influence
we
see
her
as
maiden
and
hear
of
her
as
mother
her
face
still
wearing
that
quiet
and
peculiar
light
like
the
dim
circlet
floating
round
a
pearl
and
now
as
the
strong
men
of
shakespeare
play
spoke
of
the
dead
portia
in
the
tent
paracelsus
and
festus
talk
of
the
pastor
of
einsiedeln
gentle
wife
festus
speaks
in
assured
hope
paracelsus
in
daring
surmise
of
a
life
beyond
the
grave
and
finally
with
a
bitter
return
upon
himself
from
his
sense
of
her
tranquillity
in
death
and
michal
sleeps
among
the
roots
and
dews
while
i
am
moved
at
basil
and
full
of
schemes
for
nuremberg
and
hoping
and
despairing
as
though
it
mattered
how
the
farce
plays
out
so
it
be
quickly
played
it
is
the
last
cry
of
his
distempered
egoism
before
the
closing
scene
in
the
dim
and
narrow
cell
of
the
hospital
of
st
sebastian
where
he
lies
dying
paracelsus
at
last
attains
attains
something
higher
than
a
professor
chair
at
basil
attains
a
rapture
not
to
be
expressed
in
the
joy
which
draws
him
onward
and
a
lucid
comprehension
of
the
past
that
lies
behind
all
night
the
faithful
festus
has
watched
beside
the
bed
the
mind
of
the
dying
man
is
working
as
the
sea
works
after
a
tempest
and
strange
wrecks
of
memory
float
past
in
troubled
visions
in
the
dawning
light
the
clouds
roll
away
a
great
calm
comes
upon
his
spirit
and
he
recognises
his
friend
it
is
laid
upon
him
before
he
departs
to
declare
the
meaning
of
his
life
this
life
of
his
had
been
no
farce
or
failure
in
his
degree
he
has
served
mankind
and
what
the
service
of
man
but
the
true
praise
of
god
he
perceives
now
the
errors
of
the
way
he
had
been
dazzled
by
knowledge
and
the
power
conferred
by
knowledge
he
had
not
understood
god
plan
of
gradual
evolution
through
the
ages
he
had
laboured
for
his
race
in
pride
rather
than
in
love
he
had
been
maddened
by
the
intellectual
infirmities
the
moral
imperfections
of
men
whereas
he
ought
to
have
recognised
even
in
these
the
capacities
of
a
creature
in
progress
to
a
higher
development
now
at
length
he
can
follow
in
thought
the
great
circle
of
creative
energy
ever
welling
forth
from
him
in
vast
undulations
ever
tending
to
return
to
him
again
which
return
godwards
is
already
foretold
in
the
nature
of
man
by
august
anticipations
by
strange
gleams
of
splendour
by
cares
and
fears
not
bounded
by
this
our
earth
were
a
poem
of
late
instead
of
early
origin
in
poetical
career
we
should
probably
have
received
no
such
open
prophecy
as
this
the
scholar
of
the
renaissance
would
have
casuistically
defended
or
apologised
for
his
errors
and
through
the
wreathing
mists
of
sophistry
would
have
shot
forth
ever
and
anon
some
ray
of
truth
we
receive
from
an
impression
of
the
affluence
of
youth
there
is
no
husbanding
of
resources
and
perhaps
too
little
reserve
of
power
where
the
poet
most
abandons
himself
to
his
ardour
of
thought
and
imagination
he
achieves
his
highest
work
the
stress
and
tension
of
his
enthusiasm
are
perhaps
too
continuous
too
seldom
relieved
by
spaces
of
repose
it
is
all
too
much
of
a
mazeppa
ride
there
are
times
when
we
pray
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
of
comfortable
dulness
or
at
least
of
wholesome
bovine
placidity
the
laws
of
such
a
poem
are
wholly
determined
from
within
the
only
question
we
have
a
right
to
ask
is
this
has
the
poet
adequately
dealt
with
his
subject
adequately
expressed
his
idea
the
division
of
the
whole
into
five
parts
may
seem
to
have
some
correspondency
with
the
five
acts
of
a
tragedy
but
here
the
stage
is
one
of
the
mind
and
the
acts
are
free
to
contract
or
to
expand
themselves
as
the
gale
of
thought
or
passion
rises
or
subsides
if
a
spiritual
anemometer
were
invented
it
would
be
found
that
the
wind
which
drives
through
the
poem
maintains
often
and
for
long
an
astonishing
pace
the
strangely
beautiful
lyric
passages
interspersed
through
the
speeches
are
really
of
a
slower
movement
than
the
dramatic
body
of
the
poem
they
are
by
comparison
the
perfumed
closet
of
the
song
of
paracelsus
in
part
iv
is
vowed
to
quiet
did
browning
ever
compose
another
romanza
as
lulling
as
this
and
the
maine
glides
so
gently
in
the
lyric
of
festus
part
that
its
murmuring
serves
to
bring
back
sanity
to
the
distracted
spirit
of
the
dying
aureole
there
are
youthful
excesses
in
some
vague
rhetorical
grandeurs
some
sublimities
which
ought
to
have
been
oblivious
of
self
some
errors
of
some
extravagances
of
imagery
and
of
expression
the
wonderful
passage
which
describes
as
a
dancing
psaltress
passing
over
the
earth
is
marred
by
the
presence
of
young
volcanoes
staring
together
with
their
eyes
on
flame
which
young
volcanoes
were
surely
the
offspring
of
the
young
earthquake
of
byron
but
these
are
as
the
french
phrase
has
it
defects
of
the
poem
qualities
a
few
pieces
of
base
metal
are
flung
abroad
unawares
together
with
the
lavish
gold
a
companion
poem
to
so
described
by
browning
to
leigh
hunt
was
conceived
by
the
poet
soon
after
the
appearance
of
the
volume
of
when
was
published
two
years
later
we
learn
from
a
preface
afterwards
omitted
that
he
had
been
engaged
on
browning
desired
to
complete
his
studies
for
this
poem
of
italy
among
the
scenes
which
it
describes
the
manuscript
was
with
him
in
italy
during
his
visit
of
but
the
work
was
not
to
be
hastily
completed
was
published
in
five
years
after
in
the
chronological
order
of
browning
poems
by
virtue
of
the
date
of
origin
it
lies
close
to
the
earlier
companion
piece
in
the
logical
order
it
is
the
completion
of
a
group
of
poems
paracelsus
which
treat
of
the
perplexities
the
trials
the
failures
the
ultimate
recovery
of
men
endowed
with
extraordinary
powers
it
is
one
more
study
of
the
conduct
of
genius
amid
the
dangers
and
temptations
of
life
here
we
may
rightly
disregard
the
order
of
publication
and
postpone
the
record
of
external
incidents
in
browning
poetical
development
in
order
to
place
in
its
true
position
side
by
side
with
how
the
subject
of
was
suggested
to
browning
we
do
not
know
the
study
of
dante
may
have
led
him
to
a
of
the
story
of
dante
predecessor
after
having
occupied
in
imagination
the
old
towns
of
germany
and
switzerland
w√ºrzburg
and
basil
colmar
and
salzburg
he
may
have
longed
for
the
warmth
and
colour
of
italy
after
the
renaissance
with
its
revolutionary
speculations
he
may
have
wished
to
trace
his
way
back
to
the
middle
age
when
men
lived
and
moved
under
the
shadow
of
one
or
the
other
of
two
dominant
powers
apparently
fixed
in
everlasting
rivalry
the
emperor
and
the
pope
the
historical
decoration
wrote
browning
in
the
dedicatory
letter
of
to
his
friend
milsand
was
purposely
of
no
more
importance
than
a
background
requires
and
my
stress
lay
on
the
incidents
in
the
development
of
a
soul
little
else
is
worth
study
undoubtedly
the
history
of
a
soul
is
central
in
the
poem
but
the
drawings
of
italian
landscape
so
sure
in
outline
so
vivid
in
colour
the
views
of
old
italian
city
life
rich
in
the
tumult
of
townsfolk
military
chieftains
the
pictures
of
sombre
interiors
and
southern
gardens
the
hillside
castle
amid
its
vines
the
court
of
love
with
its
contending
minstrels
the
midnight
camp
lit
by
its
fires
and
added
to
these
the
titianesque
portraits
of
portly
magnifico
and
maiden
and
statist
make
up
an
environment
which
has
no
inconsiderable
poetic
value
of
its
own
feeding
as
it
does
the
inner
eye
with
various
forms
and
dyes
and
leaving
the
spirit
in
sense
more
wealthy
with
a
theme
so
remote
from
the
common
consciousness
of
his
own
day
browning
conceived
that
there
would
be
an
advantage
in
being
his
own
commentator
and
interpreter
and
hence
he
chose
the
narrative
in
preference
to
the
dramatic
form
thus
he
supposed
he
could
act
the
showman
and
stand
aside
at
times
to
expound
his
own
intentions
unhappily
in
endeavouring
to
strengthen
and
concentrate
his
style
he
lost
that
sense
of
the
reader
distance
from
himself
which
an
artist
can
never
without
risk
forget
in
abbreviating
his
speech
his
utterance
thickened
he
created
new
difficulties
by
a
legerdemain
in
the
construction
of
sentences
he
assumed
in
his
public
an
alertness
of
intelligence
equal
to
his
own
when
it
needs
a
to
pass
from
subject
to
verb
across
the
chasm
of
a
parenthesis
when
a
reader
swings
himself
dubiously
from
relative
to
some
one
of
three
possible
antecedents
when
he
springs
at
a
meaning
through
the
fissure
of
an
undeveloped
exclamatory
phrase
and
when
these
efforts
are
demanded
again
and
again
some
muscular
fatigue
naturally
ensues
yet
it
is
true
that
when
once
the
right
connections
in
these
perplexing
sentences
have
been
established
the
sense
is
flashed
upon
the
mind
with
singular
vividness
then
the
difficulty
has
ceased
to
exist
and
thus
in
two
successive
stages
of
study
the
same
reader
may
justly
censure
for
its
obscurity
of
style
and
justly
applaud
it
for
a
remarkable
lucidity
in
swiftness
intelligent
however
as
browning
was
it
implied
a
curious
lack
of
intelligence
to
suppose
that
a
poem
of
many
thousand
lines
written
i
in
shorthand
would
speedily
find
decipherers
if
we
may
trust
the
words
of
westland
marston
recorded
by
mr
rossetti
in
preraphaelite
brotherhood
february
browning
imagined
that
his
shorthand
was
roman
type
of
unusual
clearness
marston
says
that
browning
before
publishing
sent
it
to
him
to
read
saying
that
this
time
i
the
public
should
not
accuse
him
at
any
rate
of
being
unintelligible
what
follows
in
the
is
of
interest
but
can
hardly
be
taken
as
true
to
the
letter
browning
system
of
composition
is
to
write
down
on
a
slate
in
prose
what
he
wants
to
say
and
then
turn
it
into
verse
striving
after
the
greatest
amount
of
condensation
possible
thus
if
an
exclamation
will
suggest
his
meaning
he
substitutes
this
for
a
whole
sentence
in
climbing
an
antique
tower
we
may
obtain
striking
flashes
of
prospect
through
the
slits
and
which
dimly
illuminate
the
winding
stair
but
to
combine
these
into
an
intelligible
landscape
is
not
always
easy
browning
errors
of
style
are
in
part
attributable
to
his
unhappy
application
of
a
passage
in
a
letter
of
caroline
fox
which
a
friend
had
shown
him
she
stated
that
her
acquaintance
john
sterling
had
been
repelled
by
the
verbosity
of
doth
mr
browning
know
she
asked
that
wordsworth
will
devote
a
fortnight
or
more
to
the
discovery
of
a
single
word
that
is
the
one
fit
for
his
sonnet
browning
was
determined
to
avoid
verbosity
but
the
method
which
seems
to
have
occurred
to
him
was
that
of
omitting
many
needful
though
seemingly
insignificant
words
and
jamming
together
the
words
that
gleam
and
sparkle
with
the
result
that
the
mind
is
at
once
dazzled
and
fatigued
sordello
the
italian
singer
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
conceived
by
browning
as
of
the
type
which
he
had
already
presented
in
the
speaker
of
only
that
here
the
poet
is
not
infirm
in
will
and
though
loved
by
palma
he
is
hardly
a
lover
like
the
speaker
of
he
is
preoccupied
with
an
intense
the
centre
of
his
own
imaginative
creations
and
claiming
supremacy
over
these
he
craves
some
means
of
impressing
himself
upon
the
world
some
means
of
deploying
the
power
that
lies
coiled
within
him
not
through
any
gross
passion
for
rule
but
in
order
that
he
may
thus
manifest
himself
to
himself
at
the
full
he
is
as
far
as
possible
removed
from
that
type
of
the
worshipping
spirit
exhibited
in
aprile
and
in
the
poet
eglamor
whom
sordello
foils
and
subdues
in
the
contest
of
song
the
fame
as
a
singer
which
comes
suddenly
to
him
draws
sordello
out
of
his
goito
solitude
to
the
worldly
society
of
mantua
and
his
experiences
of
disillusion
and
half
voluntary
are
those
which
had
been
faintly
shadowed
forth
in
and
exhibited
more
fully
and
yet
with
a
difference
in
the
basil
experiences
of
paracelsus
like
the
poet
of
after
his
immersion
in
worldliness
sordello
again
seeks
solitude
and
recovers
a
portion
of
his
higher
self
but
solitude
can
not
content
one
who
is
unable
to
obtain
the
which
his
nature
demands
without
the
aid
of
others
who
may
furnish
an
external
body
for
the
forces
that
lie
suppressed
within
him
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
the
prospect
of
a
political
career
opens
before
him
may
it
not
be
that
he
will
thus
obtain
what
he
needs
and
find
in
the
people
the
instrument
of
his
own
thoughts
his
passions
his
aspirations
his
imaginings
his
will
may
not
the
people
become
the
body
in
which
his
spirit
with
all
its
forces
shall
incarnate
itself
coming
into
actual
acquaintance
with
the
people
for
the
first
time
the
sight
of
their
multiform
miseries
their
sorrows
even
their
baseness
lays
hold
of
sordello
it
seems
as
if
it
were
they
who
were
about
to
make
their
instrument
the
voice
through
which
their
inarticulate
griefs
should
find
expression
he
is
captured
by
those
whom
he
thought
to
capture
by
all
his
personal
connections
he
is
of
the
imperial
party
a
ghibellin
but
studying
the
position
of
affairs
he
becomes
convinced
that
the
cause
of
the
pope
is
one
with
the
cause
of
the
people
at
this
moment
vast
possibilities
of
political
power
suddenly
widen
upon
his
view
sordello
the
minstrel
a
poor
archer
son
is
discovered
to
be
in
truth
the
only
son
of
the
great
ghibellin
chieftain
salinguerra
he
is
loved
by
palma
who
with
her
youth
and
beauty
brings
him
eminent
station
authority
and
a
passion
of
devoted
ambition
on
his
behalf
his
father
flings
upon
sordello
neck
the
baldric
which
constitutes
him
the
representative
in
northern
italy
the
heart
and
brain
of
sordello
become
the
field
of
conflict
between
fierce
contending
forces
all
that
is
egoistic
in
his
nature
cries
out
for
a
life
of
pride
and
power
and
joy
at
best
it
is
but
little
that
he
could
ever
do
to
serve
the
suffering
multitude
and
yet
should
he
falter
because
he
can
not
gain
for
them
the
results
of
time
is
it
not
his
part
to
take
the
single
step
in
their
service
though
it
can
be
no
more
than
a
step
in
the
excitement
of
this
supreme
hour
of
inward
strife
sordello
dies
but
he
dies
a
victor
like
paracelsus
he
also
has
attained
the
imperial
baldric
is
found
cast
below
the
dead
singer
feet
this
in
brief
is
the
history
of
a
soul
which
browning
has
imagined
in
his
and
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
can
be
briefly
stated
the
primary
need
of
such
a
nature
as
sordello
and
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
browning
would
have
assigned
himself
a
place
in
the
class
to
which
the
poet
of
his
imagination
belongs
is
that
of
a
power
above
himself
which
shall
deliver
him
from
egoism
and
whose
loyal
service
shall
concentrate
and
direct
his
various
faculties
and
this
a
power
not
unknown
or
remote
but
one
brought
near
and
made
manifest
or
in
other
words
it
is
the
need
of
that
which
old
religion
has
set
forth
as
god
in
christ
sordello
in
his
final
decision
in
favour
of
true
service
to
the
people
had
like
paracelsus
given
his
best
praise
to
god
had
given
his
highest
pledge
of
loyalty
to
whatever
is
divine
in
life
and
therefore
though
he
has
failed
in
all
his
high
designs
his
failure
is
in
the
end
a
success
he
like
paracelsus
had
read
that
bitter
sentence
which
declares
that
collective
man
outstrips
the
individual
god
has
conceded
two
sights
to
a
man
one
of
men
whole
work
time
completed
plan
the
other
of
the
minute
work
man
first
step
to
the
plan
completion
and
the
poor
minute
work
assigned
him
by
the
divine
law
of
justice
and
pity
he
accepts
as
his
whole
life
task
it
is
true
that
though
he
now
clearly
sees
the
end
he
has
not
perhaps
recognised
the
means
if
sordello
contemplated
political
action
as
his
mode
of
effecting
that
minute
work
he
must
soon
have
discovered
were
his
life
prolonged
that
not
thus
can
a
poet
live
in
his
highest
faculty
or
render
his
worthiest
service
the
poet
and
speaking
in
his
own
person
browning
makes
confession
of
his
faith
can
adequately
serve
his
mistress
suffering
humanity
only
as
a
poet
sordello
failed
to
render
into
song
the
highest
thoughts
and
aspirations
of
italy
but
dante
was
to
follow
and
was
not
to
fail
the
minstrel
last
act
his
renunciation
of
selfish
power
and
pleasure
his
devotion
to
what
he
held
to
be
the
cause
of
the
people
the
cause
of
humanity
was
indeed
his
best
piece
of
poetry
by
virtue
of
that
act
sordello
was
not
a
beaten
man
but
a
conqueror
these
prolonged
studies
and
on
a
more
contracted
scale
each
a
study
in
the
development
of
a
soul
gain
and
lose
through
the
immaturity
of
the
writer
he
had
as
yet
brought
only
certain
of
his
faculties
into
play
or
at
least
he
had
not
as
yet
connected
with
his
art
certain
faculties
which
become
essential
characteristics
of
his
later
work
there
is
no
humour
in
these
early
poems
or
since
naddo
and
the
critic
tribe
of
came
to
qualify
the
assertion
but
little
there
is
no
wise
casuistry
in
which
falsehood
is
used
as
the
vehicle
of
truth
the
psychology
however
involved
it
may
seem
is
really
too
simple
the
central
personages
are
too
abstract
knowledge
and
love
and
volition
do
not
exhaust
the
soul
action
and
thought
are
not
here
incorporated
one
with
the
other
a
deed
is
not
the
interpreter
of
an
idea
an
idea
is
first
exhibited
by
the
poet
and
the
deed
is
afterwards
set
forth
as
its
consequence
the
conclusions
are
too
patently
didactic
or
doctrinaire
we
suspect
that
they
have
been
motives
determining
the
action
our
scepticism
as
to
the
disinterested
conduct
of
the
story
is
aroused
by
its
too
plainly
deduced
moral
we
catch
the
powers
at
play
which
ought
to
be
invisible
we
fiddle
with
the
works
of
the
clock
till
it
ceases
to
strike
yet
if
only
a
part
of
browning
mind
is
alive
in
these
early
poems
the
faculties
brought
into
exercise
are
the
less
impeded
by
one
another
the
love
of
beauty
is
not
tripped
up
by
a
delight
in
the
grotesque
and
there
is
a
certain
pleasure
in
attending
to
prophecy
which
has
not
learnt
to
hide
itself
in
casuistry
the
analysis
of
a
state
of
mind
pursued
in
with
an
effort
that
is
sometimes
fatiguing
and
not
always
successful
is
presently
followed
by
a
superb
portrait
like
that
of
salinguerra
painted
by
the
artist
not
the
analyst
and
so
admirable
is
it
that
in
our
infirmity
we
are
tempted
to
believe
that
the
process
of
flaying
and
dissection
alters
the
person
of
a
man
or
woman
as
swift
has
said
considerably
for
the
worse

by

in

he
looks
and

more
like
a
youthful
poet
than
any
man
i
ever
saw
face
was
one
of
rare
intelligence
and
full
of
changing
expression
he
was
not
tall
but
in
early
years
he
was
slight
was
graceful
in
his
movements
and
held
his
head
high
his
dark
brown
hair
hung
in
wavy
masses
upon
his
neck
his
voice
had
in
early
manhood
a
quality
afterwards
lost

mr

describes
as
clear
sweet
and
resonant
slim
dark
and
very
handsome
are
the
words
chosen
by
mrs
to
characterise
the
youthful
browning
as
he
reappeared
to
her
memory
and
may
i
hint
it
she
adds
just
a
trifle
of
a
dandy
addicted
to
kid
gloves
and
such
things
quite
glass
of
fashion
and
the
mould
of
form
but
full
of
ambition
eager
for
success
eager
for
fame
and
what
is
more
determined
to
conquer
fame
and
to
achieve
success
yet
the
correct
and
conventional
browning
could
also
fire
up
for
lawlessness
frenetic
to
be
free
he
was
we
are
told
but
is
this
part
of
a
browning
legend
with
tramps
and
gipsies
and
he
wandered
gladly
whether
through
devout
sympathy
or
curiosity
of
mood
we
know
not

father
moved
to
a
house
at
hatcham
transporting
thither
his
long
rows
of
books
together
with
those
many
volumes
which
lay
still
unwritten
in
the
celle
fantastyk
of
his
son
there
is
a
vast

from
our

hill
wrote
browning
a
vast
view
though
wordsworth
had
scorned
the
londoner
hill
hill
call
that
such
as
that
a
here
he
read
and
wrote
enjoyed
his
rides
on
the
good
horse
york
and
cultivated
friendship
with
a
toad
in
the
pleasant
garden
for
he
had
a
peculiar
interest
as
his
poems
show
in
creatures
that
live
a
shy
mysterious
life
apart
from
that
of
man
and
the
claim
of
beauty
as
commonly
understood
was
not
needed
to
win
his
regard
browning
eye
was
an
instrument
made
for
exact
and
minute
records
of
natural
phenomena
i
have
heard
him
say
mr
sharp
writes
that
at
that
time
speaking
of
his
earlier
years
his
faculty
of
observation
would
not
have
appeared
despicable
to
a
seminole
or
an
iroquois
such
activity
of
the
visual
nerve
differs
widely
from
the
wise
passiveness
or
brooding
power
of
the
wordsworthian
mode
of
contemplation
browning
life
was
never
that
of
a
recluse
who
finds
in
nature
and
communion
with
the
anima
mundi
a
counterpoise
to
the
attractions
of
human
society
society
fatigued
him
yet
he
would
not
abandon
its
excitements
a
mystic
though
why
it
should
be
so
is
hard
to
say
does
not
ordinarily
affect
kid
gloves
as
did
the
browning
of
mrs
recollection
the
mysticism
of
temper
of
mind
came
not
by
withdrawal
from
the
throng
of
positive
facts
but
by
pushing
through
these
to
the
light
beyond
them
or
by
the
perception
of
some
shaft
of
light
piercing
the
denseness
which
was
serviceable
as
the
sheathe
or
foil
and
of
course
it
was
among
men
and
women
that
he
found
suggestions
for
some
of
his
most
original
studies
an
introduction
to
macready
which
took
place
at
mr
fox
house
towards
the
close
of
november
was
fruitful
in
consequences
a
month
later
browning
was
macready
guest
at
elstree
the
actor
in
the
country
his
then
unknown
to
him
in
the
coach
from
london
was
john
forster
in
macready
the
poet
and
his
critic
first
formed
a
personal
acquaintance
browning
had
for
long
been
much
interested
in
the
stage
but
only
as
a
spectator
his
imagination
now
turned
towards
dramatic
authorship
with
a
view
to
theatrical
performance
a
play
on
a
subject
from
later
roman
history
was
thought
of
and
was
cast
aside
the
success
of
after
the
first
performance
of
which
may
browning
supped
in
the
author
rooms
with
macready
wordsworth
and
landor
probably
raised
high
hopes
of
a
like
or
a
greater
success
for
some
future
drama
of
his
own
write
a
play
browning
said
macready
as
they
left
the
house
and
keep
me
from
going
to
america
shall
it
be
historical
or
english
browning
questioned
as
the
incident
is
related
by
mrs
orr
what
do
you
say
to
a
drama
on
strafford
the
life
of
stafford
by
his
friend
forster
just
published
which
during
an
illness
of
the
author
had
been
revised
in
manuscript
by
browning
probably
determined
the
choice
of
a
subject
by
august
the
poet
had
pledged
himself
to
achieve
this
first
dramatic
adventure
the
play
was
produced
at
covent
garden
on
may
by
macready
who
himself
took
the
part
of
strafford
helen
faucit
then
a
novice
on
the
stage
gave
an
adequate
rendering
of
the
difficult
part
of
lady
carlisle
for
the
rest
the
complexion
of
the
piece
as
browning
describes
it
after
one
of
the
latest
rehearsals
was
perfect
gallows
great
historical
personages
were
presented
by
actors
who
strutted
or
slouched
who
whimpered
or
drawled
the
financial
distress
at
covent
garden
forbade
any
splendour
or
even
dignity
of
scenery
or
of
costumes
the
text
was
considerably
altered
and
not
always
judiciously
from
that
of
the
printed
play
which
had
appeared
before
its
production
on
the
stage
yet
on
the
first
night
was
not
damned
and
on
the
second
it
was
warmly
applauded
after
the
fifth
performance
the
wretched
pym
refused
to
save
his
mother
england
even
once
more
and
the
play
was
withdrawn
browning
declared
to
his
friends
that
never
again
as
long
as
he
might
live
would
he
write
a
play
whining
not
being
to
his
taste
he
averted
his
eyes
and
set
himself
resolutely
to
work
upon
i
sail
this
morning
for
venice
browning
wrote
to
a
friend
on
good
friday
he
voyaged
as
sole
passenger
on
a
merchantman
and
soon
was
on
friendliest
terms
with
the
rough
kindly
captain
for
the
first
fortnight
the
sea
was
stormy
and
browning
suffered
much
as
they
passed
through
the
straits
of
gibraltar
captain
davidson
aided
him
to
reach
the
deck
and
a
pulsing
of
not
gave
their
origin
to
the
patriotic
lines
beginning
nobly
nobly
cape
saint
vincent
to
the
died
away
under
the
bulwark
of
the
off
the
african
coast
when
the
fancy
of
a
gallop
on
his
uncle
reuben
horse
suddenly
presented
itself
in
pleasant
contrast
with
the
tedium
of
the
hours
on
shipboard
he
wrote
in
pencil
on
the
flyleaf
of
bartoli
simboli
that
most
spirited
of
poems
which
tell
of
the
glory
of
motion
they
brought
the
good
news
from
ghent
to
the
only
adventure
of
the
voyage
was
the
discovery
of
an
algerine
pirate
ship
floating
keel
uppermost
it
righted
suddenly
under
the
stress
of
ropes
from
the
and
the
ghastly
and
intolerable
dead
algerines
and
spaniards
could
not
scare
the
british
sailors
eager
for
loot
at
last
the
battered
hulk
was
cast
loose
and
its
blackness
was
seen
reeling
slowly
off
into
the
most
gorgeous
and
lavish
sunset
in
the
world
having
visited
venice
vicenza
and
padua
cities
and
mountain
solitudes
which
gave
their
warmth
and
colour
to
his
unfinished
poem
browning
returned
home
by
way
of
tyrol
the
rhine
liege
and
antwerp
it
was
his
first
visit
to
italy
and
was
a
time
of
enchantment
fifty
years
later
he
recalled
the
memories
of
these
early
days
when
his
delight
had
something
insubstantial
magical
in
it
and
the
vision
was
half
perceived
with
the
eye
and
half
projected
from
within
how
many
a
year
my
asolo
since
one
step
just
from
sea
to
land
i
found
you
loved
yet
feared
you
so
for
natural
objects
seemed
to
stand
palpably
of
evenings
soon
after
his
return
to
london
mrs
writes
he
was
full
of
enthusiasm
for
venice
that
queen
of
cities
he
used
to
illustrate
his
glowing
descriptions
of
its
beauties
the
palaces
the
sunsets
the
moonrises
by
a
most
original
kind
of
etching
taking
up
a
bit
of
stray
notepaper
he
would
hold
it
over
a
lighted
candle
moving
the
paper
about
gently
till
it
was
cloudily
smoked
over
and
then
utilising
the
darker
smears
for
clouds
shadows
water
or
what
not
would
etch
with
a
dry
pen
the
forms
of
lights
on
cloud
and
palace
on
bridge
or
gondola
on
the
vague
and
dreamy
surface
he
had
produced
the
anticipations
of
genius
had
already
produced
a
finer
etching
than
any
of
these
in
those
lines
of
marvellous
swiftness
and
intensity

the
publication
of
did
not
improve
browning
position
with
the
public
the
poem
was
a
challenge
to
the
understanding
of
an
aspirant
reader
and
the
challenge
met
with
no
response
an
excuse
for
not
reading
a
poem
of
five
or
six
thousand
lines
is
grateful
to
so
infirm
and
shortlived
a
being
as
man
and
indeed
a
prophet
if
prudent
may
do
well
to
postpone
the
privilege
of
being
unintelligible
until
he
has
secured
a
considerable
number
of
disciples
of
both
sexes
the
reception
of
might
have
disheartened
a
poet
of
less
vigorous
will
than
browning
he
merely
marched
breast
forward
and
let
lie
inert
until
a
new
generation
of
readers
had
arisen
the
dramas
victor
and
king
and
return
of
the
at
first
named
mansoor
the
hierophant
now
occupied
his
thoughts
short
lyrical
pieces
were
growing
under
his
hand
and
began
to
form
a
considerable
group
and
one
fortunate
day
as
he
strolled
alone
in
the
dulwich
wood
his
chosen
resort
of
meditation
the
image
flashed
upon
him
of
one
walking
thus
alone
through
life
one
apparently
too
obscure
to
leave
a
trace
of
his
or
her
passage
yet
exercising
a
lasting
though
unconscious
influence
at
every
step
of
it
in
other
words
pippa
had
suddenly
passed
her
poet
in
the
wood
a
cheap
mode
of
issuing
his
works
now
in
manuscript
was
suggested
to
browning
by
the
publisher
moxon
they
might
appear
in
successive
pamphlets
each
of
a
single
sheet
printed
in
and
the
series
might
be
discontinued
at
any
time
if
the
public
ceased
to
care
for
it
the
general
title
and
was
chosen
beneath
upon
the
hem
of
the
robe
thou
shalt
make
pomegranates
of
blue
and
of
purple
and
of
scarlet
round
about
the
hem
thereof
and
bells
of
gold
between
them
round
about
browning
as
he
explained
to
his
readers
in
the
last
number
meant
to
indicate
by
the
title
something
like
an
alternation
or
mixture
of
music
with
discoursing
sound
with
sense
poetry
with
thought
such
having
been
in
fact
one
of
the
most
familiar
of
the
rabbinical
interpretations
designed
to
expound
the
symbolism
of
this
priestly
decoration
prescribed
in
exodus
from

the
numbers
of

successively
appeared
with
the
eighth
the
series
closed
the
first
number
was
sold
for
sixpence
when
victor

was
published
in
the
following
year
the
price
was
raised
to
one
shilling
the
third

were
made
up
of
short
pieces

and

numbers
and
followed
each
other
in
the
same

the
only
number
which
is
known
to
survive
in
manuscript
came
next
in
order
the
last
to
appear
was
that
which
included

wonderful

the

may
now
be
congratulated
only
one
of
the
numbers
blot
in
the
attained
the
distinction
of
a
second
edition
and
this
probably
because
the
drama
as
published
was
helped
to
a
comparative
popularity
by
its
representation
on
the
stage
this
tragedy
of
young
love
and
death
was
written
hastily
in
four
or
five
days
for
macready
browning
while
at
work
on
his
play
as
we
learn
from
a
letter
of
dante
rossetti
to
allingham
was
kept
indoors
by
a
slight
indisposition
his
father
on
going
to
see
him
was
each
day
received
boisterously
and
cheerfully
with
the
words
have
done
another
act
father
forster
read
the
tragedy
aloud
from
the
manuscript
for
dickens
who
wrote
of
it
with
unmeasured
enthusiasm
in
a
letter
known
to
browning
only
when
printed
after
the
lapse
of
some
thirty
years
browning
play
has
thrown
me
into
a
perfect
passion
of
sorrow
i
know
no
love
like
it
no
passion
like
it
no
moulding
of
a
splendid
thing
after
its
conception
like
it
things
had
gone
ill
with
macready
at
drury
lane
and
when
the
time
for
blot
in
the
drew
near
it
is
evident
that
he
feared
further
losses
and
would
gladly
have
been
released
from
his
promise
to
produce
the
play
but
browning
failed
to
divine
the
true
state
of
affairs
the
tragedy
was
read
to
the
company
by
a
grotesque
and
prompter
and
it
was
greeted
with
laughter
to
make
amends
macready
himself
undertook
to
read
it
aloud
but
he
declared
himself
unable
in
the
disturbed
state
of
his
mind
to
appear
before
the
public
his
part
that
of
lord
tresham
must
be
taken
by
phelps
from
certain
rehearsals
phelps
was
unavoidably
absent
through
illness
macready
who
read
his
lines
on
these
occasions
now
was
caught
by
the
play
and
saw
possibilities
in
the
part
of
tresham
which
fired
his
imagination
he
chose
almost
at
the
last
moment
to
displace
his
younger
and
less
distinguished
colleague
browning
on
the
other
hand
insisted
that
phelps
having
been
assigned
the
part
should
retain
it
to
baffle
macready
in
his
design
of
presenting
the
play
to
the
public
in
a
mutilated
form
browning
aided
by
his
publisher
had
the
whole
printed
in
hours
a
rupture
of
the
friendship
with
macready
followed
nor
did
author
and
actor
meet
again
until
after
the
great
sorrow
of
life
mr
macready
too
writes
mrs
orr
had
recently
lost
his
wife
and
mr
browning
could
only
start
forward
grasp
the
hand
of
his
old
friend
and
in
a
voice
choked
with
emotion
say
macready
the
tragedy
was
produced
at
drury
lane
on
february
nth
with
phelps
who
acted
admirably
as
tresham
and
helen
faucit
as
mildred
although
it
had
been
ill
rehearsed
and
not
a
shilling
had
been
spent
on
scenery
or
dresses
it
was
received
with
applause
to
a
call
for
the
author
browning
seated
in
his
box
declined
to
make
any
response
thus
not
without
some
soreness
of
heart
closed
his
direct
connection
with
the
theatre
he
heard
with
pleasure
when
in
italy
that
blot
in
the
was
given
by
phelps
at
sadler
wells
theatre
in
november
and
with
unquestionable
success
a
rendering
of
was
projected
by
charles
kean
in
but
the
long
delays
which
were
inevitable
could
not
be
endured
by
browning
who
desired
to
print
his
play
forthwith
among
the
and
it
was
not
until
nine
years
later
that
this
play
a
veritable
all
for
love
or
the
world
well
lost
was
presented
at
the
haymarket
helen
faucit
appearing
as
the
duchess
soon
after
had
been
published
browning
sailed
once
more
in
the
autumn
of
for
italy
as
he
journeyed
northwards
and
homewards
from
naples
where
they
were
performing
an
opera
named
and
rome
he
sought
and
obtained
at
leghorn
an
interview
with
trelawny
the
friend
of
shelley
by
whose
grave
he
had
lately
stood
browning
work
as
a
playwright
consisting
of
eight
pieces
or
nine
if
we
include
the
later
a
is
sufficiently
ample
to
enable
us
to
form
a
trustworthy
estimate
of
his
genius
as
seen
in
drama
dramatic
in
the
sense
that
he
created
and
studied
minds
and
hearts
other
than
his
own
he
was
if
he
desired
to
set
forth
or
to
vindicate
his
most
intimate
ideas
or
impulses
he
effected
this
indirectly
by
detaching
them
from
his
own
personality
and
giving
them
a
brain
and
a
heart
other
than
his
own
in
which
to
live
and
move
and
have
their
being
there
is
a
kind
of
dramatic
art
which
we
may
term
static
and
another
kind
which
we
may
term
dynamic
the
former
deals
especially
with
characters
in
position
the
latter
with
characters
in
movement
passion
and
thought
may
be
exhibited
and
interpreted
by
dramatic
genius
of
either
type
to
represent
passion
and
thought
and
action
action
incarnating
and
developing
thought
and
passion
the
dynamic
power
is
required
and
by
action
we
are
to
understand
not
merely
a
visible
deed
but
also
a
word
a
feeling
an
idea
which
has
in
it
a
direct
operative
force
the
dramatic
genius
of
browning
was
in
the
main
of
the
static
kind
it
studies
with
extraordinary
skill
and
subtlety
character
in
position
it
attains
only
an
imperfect
or
a
laboured
success
with
character
in
movement
the
are
ready
at
almost
every
moment
except
the
culminating
moments
of
passion
to
fall
away
from
action
into
reflection
and
the
play
of
mind
upon
mind
he
recognises
of
course
as
a
matter
of
profound
interest
and
importance
but
he
catches
the
energy
which
spirit
transfers
to
spirit
less
in
the
actual
moment
of
transference
than
after
it
has
arrived
thought
and
emotion
with
him
do
not
circulate
freely
through
a
group
of
persons
receiving
some
modification
from
each
he
deals
most
successfully
with
each
individual
as
a
single
and
separate
entity
each
maintains
his
own
attitude
and
as
he
is
touched
by
the
common
influence
he
proceeds
to
scrutinise
it
mind
in
these
plays
threads
its
way
dexterously
in
and
out
of
action
it
is
not
itself
sufficiently
incorporated
in
action
the
progress
of
the
drama
is
now
retarded
and
again
as
if
the
author
perceived
that
the
story
had
fallen
behind
or
remained
stationary
it
is
accelerated
by
sudden
jerks
a
dialogue
of
retrospection
is
a
common
device
at
the
opening
of
popular
plays
with
a
view
to
expound
the
position
of
affairs
to
the
audience
but
a
dramatic
writer
of
genius
usually
works
forward
through
his
dialogue
to
the
end
which
he
has
set
before
him
with
browning
for
the
purpose
of
mental
analysis
a
dialogue
of
retrospection
may
be
of
higher
value
than
one
which
leans
and
presses
towards
the
future
the
invisible
is
for
him
more
important
than
the
visible
and
so
in
truth
it
may
often
be
but
the
highest
dramatist
will
not
choose
to
separate
the
two
the
invisible
is
best
captured
and
is
most
securely
held
in
the
visible
as
a
writer
of
drama
browning
who
delights
to
study
the
noblest
attitudes
of
the
soul
and
to
wring
a
proud
sense
of
triumph
out
of
apparent
failure
finds
his
proper
field
in
tragedy
rather
than
in
comedy
has
a
joyous
ending
but
the
joy
is
very
grave
and
earnest
and
the
body
of
the
play
is
made
up
of
serious
pleadings
and
serious
hopes
and
fears
there
is
no
mirth
no
real
gaiety
of
temper
anywhere
in
the
dramas
of
browning
gladness
in
her
holiday
from
the
task
of
is
touched
with
pathos
in
the
thought
that
what
is
so
bright
also
so
brief
and
it
is
encompassed
even
within
delightful
asolo
by
the
sins
and
sorrows
of
the
world
bluphocks
with
his
sniggering
wit
and
his
jingles
of
rhyme
is
a
vagabond
and
a
spy
who
only
covers
the
shame
of
his
nakedness
with
these
rags
of
good
spirits
the
genial
cynicism
of
ogniben
is
excellent
of
its
kind
and
pleases
the
palate
like
an
olive
amid
wines
but
this
man
of
universal
intellectual
sympathies
is
at
heart
the
satirist
of
moral
illusions
the
unmasker
of
who
with
long
experience
of
human
infirmities
has
come
to
chuckle
gently
over
his
own
skill
in
dealing
with
them
and
has
he
not
we
may
ask
wound
around
his
own
spirit
some
of
the
incurable
illusions
of
worldly
wisdom
no
this
is
not
gaiety
if
browning
smiles
with
his
ogniben
his
smile
is
a
comment
upon
the
weakness
and
the
blindness
of
the
browning
tragedies
are
tragedies
without
villains
the
world
is
here
the
villain
which
has
baits
and
bribes
and
snares
wherewith
to
entangle
its
victims
to
lure
down
their
mounting
aspirations
to
dull
their
vision
for
the
things
and
faint
perhaps
also
to
make
them
prosperous
and
portly
gentlemen
and
amiably
cynical
tolerant
of
evil
and
prudently
distrustful
of
good
yet
truth
is
truth
and
fact
is
fact
worldly
wisdom
is
genuine
wisdom
after
its
kind
we
shall
be
the
better
instructed
if
we
listen
to
its
sage
experience
if
we
listen
understand

in
all
justice

ogniben
can
blandly
and
skilfully
conduct
a
chiappino
to
his
valley
of
humiliation
let
him
that
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
fall
but
what
would
the
wisdom
of
ogniben
be
worth
in
its
pronouncements
on
a
luria
or
a
colombe
perhaps
even
in
such
a
case
not
wholly
valueless
the
legate
might
after
all
have
applauded
a
moral
heroism
or
a
gallantry
which
would
ill
accord
with
his
own
ingenious
and
versatile
spirit
bishop
blougram
sleek
ecclesiastical
opportunist
was
not
insensible
to
the
superior
merits
of
rough
grand
old
martin
luther
in
browning
nature
a
singularly
keen
exploring
intelligence
was
united
with
a
rare
moral
and
spiritual
ardour
a
passion
for
high
ideals
in
creating
his
chief
he
distributes
among
them
what
he
found
within
himself
and
they
fall
into
two
principal
groups
characters
in
which
the
predominating
power
is
intellect
and
characters
in
which
the
mastery
lies
with
some
lofty
emotion
the
intellect
dealing
with
things
that
are
real
and
positive
those
persons
in
whom
intelligence
is
supreme
may
too
easily
become
the
children
of
this
world
in
their
own
sphere
they
are
wiser
than
the
children
of
light
and
they
are
skilled
in
a
moral
casuistry
by
which
they
justify
to
themselves
the
darkening
of
the
light
that
is
in
them
the
passionate
natures
have
an
intelligence
of
their
own
they
follow
a
gleam
which
is
visible
to
them
if
not
to
others
they
discover
or
rather
they
are
discovered
by
some
truth
which
flashes
forth
in
one
inspired
moment
the
of
a
lifetime
they
possess
the
sublime
certainty
of
love
loyalty
devotion
if
they
err
through
a
heroic
folly
and
draw
upon
themselves
ruin
in
things

may
there
not
be
some
atom
of

wisdom
at
the
heart
of
the
folly
which
is
itself
indestructible
and
which
ensures
for
them
a
welfare
out
of

and
space
prophet
and
casuist
browning
is
both
and
to
each
he
will
endeavour
to
be
just
but
his
heart
must
give
a
casting
vote
and
this
can
not
be
in
favour
of
the
casuist
every
passion
has
in
it
a
divine
promise
and
pledge
even
the
passion
of
the
senses
if
it
has
hidden
within
it
one
spark
of
love
may
be
the
salvation
of
a
soul
it
is
ottima
lifted
above
her
own
superb
voluptuousness
who
cries
not
me
to
him
o
god
be
merciful
the
region
of
untrammelled
unclouded
passion
of
spiritual
intuition
and
of
those
great
words
from
heaven
which
pierce
even
to
the
dividing
asunder
of
the
joints
and
marrow
is
for
browning
imagination
the
east
the
nations
of
the
west
and
before
all
others
the
italian
race
are
those
of
a
subtly
developed
intelligence
the
worldly
art
of
a
ingenuities
of
theology
having
aided
in
refining
ingenuities
of
worldliness
is
perhaps
the
finest
exemplar
of
unalloyed
western
but
italy
is
also
a
land
of
passion
and
therefore
at
once
for
its
ardours
of
the
heart
seen
not
in
love
alone
but
in
carven
capital
and
on
frescoed
wall
and
for
its
casuistries
of
intellect
browning
looks
to
italy
for
the
material
best
fitted
to
his
artistry
between
that
group
of
personages
whom
we
may
call
his
characters
of
passion
and
that
group
made
up
of
his
characters
of
intelligence
lie
certain
figures
of
peculiar
interest
by
birth
and
inheritance
children
of
the
east
and
by
culture
partakers
in
a
greater
or
a
less
degree
of
the
characteristics
of
the
west
a
djabal
with
his
oriental
heart
entangled
by
prankish
tricks
of
sophistry
a
luria
whose
moorish
passion
is
enthralled
by
the
fascination
of
florentine
intellect
and
who
can
make
a
return
upon
himself
with
a
western
loyalties
devotions
to
a
person
to
a
cause
to
an
ideal
and
the
sacrifice
of
individual
advantages
worldly
prosperity
temporal
successes
to
these
such
stated
in
a
broad
and
general
way
is
the
theme
of
special
interest
to
browning
in
his
dramas
these
loyalties
may
be
well
and
wisely
fixed
or
they
may
contain
a
portion
of
error
and
illusion
but
in
either
case
they
furnish
a
test
of
manly
and
womanly
virtue
with
a
woman
the
test
is
often
proposed
by
love
by
love
as
set
over
against
ease
or
high
station
or
the
pride
of
power
colombe

of

man
who
if
he
can
not
give

no
ignoble

a

of
honour
of

and
of
high
ambition
on
the

the

nameless
provincial
past
his
days
of
youth
lean
and
somewhat
worn
and
burdened
with
the
griefs
and
wrongs
of
his
townsfolk
mere
largeness
in
a
life
is
something
is
much
but
the
quality
of
a
life
is
more
valence

set
the
cause
of

he
has
made
the
heart
of
the
duchess
for
the
first
time
thrill
in
sympathy
with
the
life
of
her
people
he
has
placed
his
loyalty
to
her
far
above
his
own
hopes
of
happiness
he
has
urged
his
claims
with
unfaltering
fidelity
it
is
not
with
any
backward
glances
of
regret
any
prudent
reserves
or
condescending
qualifications
that

to
the
advocate

unexpectedly

to

made

election
colombe
can
throw
away
the
world
as
gaily
as
in
some
girlish
frolic
she
might
toss
aside
a
rose
the
loyalty
of
men
their
supreme
devotion
and
their
test
may
as
with
women
spring
from
the
passion
of
love
but
other
tests
than
this
are
often
proposed
to
them
with
king
charles
of
sardinia
it
is
duty
to
his
people
that
summons
him
from
those
modest
and
tranquil
ways
of
life
of
which
he
dreamed
to
the
cares
and
toils
of
the
crown
he
has
strength
to
accept
without
faltering
the
burden
that
is
laid
upon
him
and
if
he
falters
at
the
last
and
would
resign
to
his
father
who
reclaims
it
the
crown
which
god
alone
should
have
removed
shall
we
assert
confidently
that
browning
dramatic
instinct
has
erred
the
pity
of
it
that
his
great
father
daring
in
battle
profound
in
policy
should
stand
before
him
an
outraged
helpless
old
man
craving
with
senile
greed
a
gift
from
his
son
the
pity
of
it
revives
an
old
weakness
an
old
instinct
of
filial
submission
in
the
heart
of
charles
he
has
tasked
himself
without
sparing
he
has
gained
the
affections
of
his
subjects
he
has
conciliated
a
hostile
europe
is
not
this
enough
or
was
it
also
in
the
bond
that
he
should
tread
a
miserable
father
into
the
dust
the
test
again
of
luigi
in
the
third
part
of
is
that
of
one
who
sees
all
the
oppression
of
his
people
who
is
enamoured
of
the
antique
ideal
of
liberty
and
whose
choice
lies
between
a
youth
of
luxurious
ease
and
the
virtue
of
one
heroic
crime
to
be
followed
by
the
with
youth
cut
short
to
him
that
overcometh
and
endureth
unto
the
end
will
god
give
the
the
gift
of
the
have
i
god
gift
of
the
and
luigi
will
adventure
forth
it
may
be
in
a
kind
of
divine
folly
as
a
doomsman
commissioned
by
god
to
free
his
italy
the
devotion
of
luria
to
florence
is
partly
of
the
imagination
and
perhaps
it
is
touched
with
something
of
illusion
but
the
actual
florence
with
her
astute
politicians
her
spies
who
spy
upon
spies
her
incurable
distrusts
her
sinister
fears
her
ingrained
ingratitude
is
clearly
exposed
to
him
before
the
end
shall
he
turn
the
army
which
is
as
much
his
own
as
the
sword
he
wields
joined
with
the
forces
of
pisa
against
the
beautiful
faithless
city
or
will
his
passionate
loyalty
endure
the
test
luria
withdraws
from
life
but
not
until
he
has
made
every
provision
for
the
victory
of
florence
over
her
enemy
nor
does
he
die
a
defeated
man
his
moral
greatness
has
subdued
all
envies
and
all
distrusts
at
the
close
everyone
is
true
to
him
the
only
fault
with
time
all
men
become
good
creatures
but
so
slow
once
again
in
browning
earliest
play
the
test
for
the
patriot
pym
lies
in
the
choice
between
two
loyalties
one
to
england
and
to
freedom
the
other
to
his
early
friend
and
former
comrade
in
politics
his
faith
in
strafford
dies
hard
but
it
dies
he
flings
forward
his
hopes
for
the
grand
traitor
to
england
beyond
the
confines
of
this
life
and
only
the
grieved
unfaltering
justiciary
remains
browning
pym
is
a
figure
neither
historically
true
nor
dramatically
effective
he
is
and
sentimental
a
patriot
armed
in
rhetoric
but
the
writer
let
us
remember
was
young
this
was
his
first
theatrical
essay
and
he
was
somewhat
showy
of
fine
intentions
the
loyalty
of
strafford
to
the
king
is
too
fatuous
an
instinct
to
gain
our
complete
sympathy
he
rides
gallantly
into
the
quicksand
knowing
it
to
be
such
and
the
quicksand
as
certainly
as
the
worm
of
nilus
will
do
its
kind
and
yet
though
this
is
the
vain
romance
of
loyalty
in
it
as
browning
conceives
lies
the
test
of
strafford
a
passion
of
any
kind
is
not
so
common
that
we
can
afford
to
look
on
his
with
scorn
over
against
these
devotees
of
the
ideal
browning
sets
his
worldlings
ranging
from
creatures
as
despicable
as
the
courtiers
of
duchess
colombe
to
such
men
of
power
and
inexhaustible
resource
as
the
nuncio
who
confronts
djabal
with
his
druses
or
the
papal
legate
whose
easier
and
task
is
to
dismiss
to
his
private
affairs
at
lugo
the
leader
of
revolt
to
the
same
breed
with
the
courtiers
of
colombe
belong
old
vane
and
savile
of
the
court
of
charles
to
the
same
breed
with
the
nuncio
and
the
legate
belongs
monsignor
who
proves
himself
more
than
a
match
for
his
hireling
the
scoundrel
intendant
in
a
happy
moment
monsignor
is
startled
into
indignant
wrath
he
does
not
exclaim
with
the
edmund
of
shakespeare
tragedy
some
good
i
mean
to
do
before
i
die
but
his
gag
the
villain
is
a
substantial
contribution
to
the
justice
of
our
world
under
the
ennobling
influence
of
charles
and
his
polyxena
the
craft
of
is
uplifted
to
a
level
of
real
dignity
if
he
can
not
quite
attain
the
position
of
a
martyr
for
the
truth
he
becomes
something
better
than
one
who
serves
god
at
the
devil
bidding
and
braccio
plotter
and
betrayer
yet
always
with
a
certain
fidelity
towards
his
is
won
over
to
the
side
of
simple
truth
and
righteousness
by
the
overmastering
power
of
luria
magnanimity
so
precious
after
all
browning
would
say
is
the
mere
capacity
to
recognise
facts
if
only
a
little
grain
of
virtue
remains
in
the
heart
this
faculty
of
vision
may
make
some
sudden
discovery
which
shall
prove
to
a
worldling
that
there
exist
facts
undeniable
and
of
immense
potency
hitherto
unknown
to
his
philosophy
of
chicane
browning
vote
is
given
as
has
been
said
and
with
no
uncertain
voice
for
his
devotees
of
the
ideal
but
the
men
of
fine
worldly
have
a
fascination
for
him
as
they
have
for
his
eastern
luria
in
djabal
at
once
enthusiast
and
impostor
browning
may
seem
as
often
afterwards
to
offer
an
apology
for
the
palterer
with
truth
but
in
the
interests
of
truth
itself
he
desires
to
study
the
strange
phenomenon
of
the
deceiver

of
fewer
elements
than

is
somewhat

controlled
by
its

the
incalculable
multiplicity
in

of

they
admit
of

to
a
degree
which
places
them
at
a
distance
from
the

open
secrets

creation
they

the
carnal
passion
of
womanhood
dazzling
in
the
effrontery
of
sin
yet
including
the
possibility
which
browning
conceives
as
existing
at
the
extreme
edge
of
every
expansive
ardour
of
being
translated
into
a
higher
form
of
passion
which
abolishes

of

anael
of

of
the

pure
and
measureless
devotion
the
cry
of
hakeem
as
she
falls
is
not
an
act
of
faith
but
of
love
it
pierces
through
the
shadow
of
the
material
falsehood
to
her
one
illuminated
truth
of
absolute
love
like
that
other
falsehood
which
sanctifies
the
dying
lips
of
desdemona
the
sin
of
mildred
is
the
very
innocence
of
sin
and
does
not
really
alter
the
simplicity
of
her
character
it
is
only
the
girlish
rapture
of
giving
with
no
limitation
whatever
may
prove
a
bounty
to
him
whom
she
loves
come
what
come
will
you
have

the
remorse
of

the
remorse
of

anguish
of

dark
colours
of

cousin
guendolen
by
virtue

girlhood

kinswoman
of

of

of
shakespeare
which
rings
with
laughter
polyxena
the
queen
of
sardinia
a
daughter
not
of
italy
but
of
the
rhineland
is
in
her
degree
an
eighteenth
century
representative
of
the
woman
of
the
ancient
teutonic
tribes
grave
resolute
wise
and
possessing
the
authority
of
wisdom
she
whose
heart
and
brain
work
bravely
together
like
loyal
comrades
is
strongly
but
also
simply
conceived
as
the
helpmate
the
counsellor
and
in
the
old
sense
of
the
word
the
comforter
of
her
husband
something
of
almost
maternal
feeling
as
happens
at
times
in
real
life
mingles
with
her
wifely
affection
for
charles
who
indeed
may
prove
on
occasions
a
fractious
son
like
a
wise
she
remembers
on
these
occasions
that
he
is
only
a
man
and
that
men
in
their
unwisdom
may
grow
impatient
of
unalleviated
he
will
by
and
by
discover
his
error
and
she
can
bide
her
time
perhaps
like
other
heroines
of
browning
polyxena
is
too
constantly
and
uniformly
herself
yet
no
doubt
it
is
right
that
opaline
shifting
hues
should
not
disturb
our
impression
of
a
character
whose
special
virtue
is
steadfastness
the
queen
of
the
english
charles
who
is
eager
to
counsel
and
always
in
her
petulance
and
folly
to
counsel
ill
is
slightly
sketched
but
she
may
be
thanked
for
one
admirable
speech
her
first
when
strafford
worn
and
fevered
in
the
royal
service
has
just
arrived
from
ireland
and
passing
out
from
his
interview
with
the
king
is
encountered
by
her
is
it
over
then
why
he
looks
yellower
than
ever
well
at
least
we
shall
not
hear
eternally
of
service
services
he
paid
at
least
the
lady
carlisle
of
the
same
play
a
creature
in
the
main
of
imagination
had
the
play
been
elizabethan
or
jacobean
would
have
followed
her
lord
in
a
page
dress
have
lived
on
half
a
smile
a
day
and
perhaps
have
succeeded
in
dying
languishingly
and
happily
upon
his
sword
she
is
not
quite
unreal
nor
yet
quite
real
something
much
better
than
a
stage
property
and
not
wholly
a
living
woman
more
of
a
beaumont
and
fletcher
personage
of
the
boards
and
as
such
effective
than
a
shakespearian
piece
of
nature
the
theatrical
limbo
to
which
such
almost
but
not
quite
embodied
shadows
ultimately
troop
is
capacious
in
browning
dramatic
scene
of
a
he
created
with
unqualified
success
a
very
woman
in
the
enamoured
queen
whose
heart
at
fifty
years
beats
only
more
wildly
and
desperately
than
a
girl
the
young
lovers
constance
and
norbert
are
a
highly
meritorious
pair
who
express
their
passion
in
excellent
and
eloquent
periods
we
have
seen
their
like
before
and
since
but
the
queen
with
her
unslaked
thirst
for
the
visionary
wells
under
the
who
finds
herself
still
amid
the
burning
sands
is
an
original
and
tragic
figure
a
royal
mlle
de
lespinasse
and
crowned
with
fiery
and
immitigable
pain
although
she
has
returned
the
glare
of
constance
with
the
glare
of
a
panther
the
queen
is
the
guards
it
is
true
arrive
as
the
curtain
falls
but
those
readers
who
have
wasted
their
tender
emotion
on
a
couple
of
afflicted
prisoners
or
decapitated
young
persons
whom
mother
nature
can
easily
replace
are
mistaken
if
the
queen
does
not
die
that
night
she
will
rise
next
morning
after
sleepless
hours
haggard
not
fifty
but
eighty
years
old
and
her
passion
will
heroically
slay
itself
in
an
act
of
generosity
little
more
however
than
a
situation
is
represented
in
this
dramatic
scene
of
browning
portraits
of
women
in
the
dramas
the
finest
piece
of
work
is
the
portrait
of
the
happiest
woman
the
of
juliers
no
longer
duchess
but
ever
our
lady
of
dear
ravestein
colombe
is
no
incarnated
idea
but
a
complete
human
being
irreducible
to
a
formula
whom
we
know
the
better
because
there
is
always
in
her
more
of
exquisite
womanhood
to
be
discovered
even
the
too
fortunate
valence
all
readers
of
his
own
sex
must
pronounce
him
too
fortunate
will
for
ever
be
finding
her
anew
in
the
development
of
his
dramatic
style
browning
more
and
more
lost
sight
of
the
theatre
and
its
requirements
his
stage
became
more
and
more
a
stage
of
the
mind
his
first
play
is
the
work
of
a
novice
who
has
little
of
the
instinct
for
theatrical
effect
but
who
sets
his
brain
to
invent
striking
tableaux
to
prepare
surprises
to
exhibit
impressive
attitudes
to
calculate
not
always
successfully
the
angle
of
a
speech
so
that
it
may
with
due
impact
reach
the
pit
the
opening
scene
expounds
the
situation
in
the
second
wentworth
and
pym
confront
each
other
the
king
surprises
them
wentworth
lets
fall
the
hand
of
pym
as
the
stage
tradition
requires
as
wentworth
withdraws
the
queen
enters
to
unmake
what
he
has
made
and
the
scene
closes
with
a
tableau
expressing
the
sentimental
weakness
of
charles
come
dearest
look
the
little
fairy
now
that
can
not
reach
my
shoulder
dearest
come
and
so
proceeds
the
tragedy
with
much
that
ought
to
be
dear
to
the
average
actor
which
yet
is
somehow
not
always
even
theatrically
happy
the
pathos
of
the
closing
scene
where
strafford
is
discovered
in
the
tower
sitting
with
his
children
is
theatrical
pathos
of
the
most
correct
kind
and
each
little
speech
of
little
william
and
little
anne
is
uttered
as
much
for
the
audience
as
for
their
father
implying
in
every
word
see
how
we
poor
innocents
heighten
the
pity
of
it
the
hastily
written
blot
in
the
is
perhaps
of
dramas
the
best
fitted
for
theatrical
representation
yet
it
is
incurably
weak
in
the
motives
which
determine
the
action
and
certain
passages
are
almost
ludicrously
undramatic
if
romeo
before
he
flung
up
his
ladder
of
ropes
had
paused
like
mertoun
to
salute
his
mistress
with
a
tenor
morceau
from
the
opera
it
is
to
be
feared
that
and
other
eyes
would
not
have
winked
and
that
old
capulet
would
have
come
upon
the
scene
in
his
prepared
to
hasten
the
catastrophe
with
a
long
sword
yet
blot
in
the
with
its
breadth
of
outline
its
striking
situations
and
its
mastery
of
the
elementary
passions
love
and
wrath
and
pride
and
pity
gives
us
assurance
that
browning
might
have
taken
a
place
of
considerable
distinction
had
he
been
born
in
an
age
of
great
dramatic
poetry
if
it
is
weak
in
construction
so
though
in
a
less
degree
are
of
and
shakespeare
in
victor
and
king
browning
adopted
and
no
doubt
deliberately
a
plain
unfigured
and
uncoloured
style
as
suiting
both
the
characters
and
the
historical
subject
the
political
background
of
this
play
and
that
of
hardly
entitles
either
drama
to
be
named
political
browning
was
a
student
of
history
but
it
was
individuals
and
not
society
that
interested
him
the
affairs
of
england
and
the
affairs
of
sardinia
serve
to
throw
out
the
figures
of
the
chief
those
affairs
are
not
considered
for
their
own
sake
certain
social
conditions
are
studied
as
they
enter
into
and
help
to
form
an
individual
the
bishop
who
orders
his
tomb
at
st
praxed
is
in
part
a
product
of
the
italian
renaissance
but
the
causes
are
seen
only
in
their
effects
upon
the
character
of
a
representative
person
if
the
plain
substantial
style
of
victor
and
king
is
proper
to
a
play
with
such
a
hero
as
charles
and
such
a
heroine
as
polyxena
the
coloured
style
rich
in
imagery
is
no
less
right
in
return
of
the
where
religious
and
chivalric
enthusiasm
are
blended
with
the
enthusiasm
of
the
passion
of
love
but
already
browning
was
ceasing
to
bear
in
mind
the
conditions
of
the
stage
certain
pages
where
djabal
and
khalil
djabal
and
anael
anael
and
loys
are
the
speakers
might
be
described
as
dialogues
conducted
by
means
of
asides
and
even
the
imagination
of
a
reader
resents
a
construction
of
scenes
which
requires
these
duets
of
soliloquies
these
long
sequences
of
the
with
the
very
tragical
mirth
of
the
second
part
of
chiappino
story
of
moral
and
political
disaster
the
spectators
and
the
stage
have
wholly
disappeared
from
browning
theatre
the
imaginary
dialogue
is
highly
dramatic
in
one
sense
of
the
word
and
is
admirable
in
its
kind
but
we
transport
ourselves
best
to
the
of
faenza
by
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
is
singular
in
its
construction
scenes
detached
though
not
wholly
disconnected
are
strung
upon
the
gold
thread
slender
but
sufficiently
strong
of
an
idea
realism
in
art
as
we
now
call
it
hangs
from
a
fine
idealism
this
substantial
globe
of
earth
with
its
griefs
its
grossnesses
its
heroism
swings
suspended
from
the
seat
of
god
the
idea
which
gives
unity
to
the
whole
is
not
a
mere
fantasy
the
magic
practised
by
the
unconscious
pippa
through
her
songs
is
of
that
genuine
and
beautiful
kind
which
the
renaissance
men
of
science
named
magia
naturalis
it
is
no
fantasy
but
a
fact
that
each
of
us
influences
the
lives
of
others
more
or
less
every
day
and
at
times
in
a
peculiar
degree
in
ways
of
which
we
are
not
aware
let
this
fact
be
seized
with
imaginative
intensity
and
let
the
imagination
render
it
into
a
symbol
we
catch
sight
of
pippa
with
her
songs
passing
down
the
and
under
the
of
asolo
her
only
service
to
god
on
this
one
holiday
of
a
toilsome
year
is
to
be
glad

misconceives
everything
that
concerns

other

even
monsignor
for

moment
rises
into
the
sacred
avenger
of

her
own
service
though
she
knows
it
not
is
more
than
a
mere
gladness
she
the
little
rays
forth
the
influences
of
a
heart
that
has
the
potency
ascribed
to
gems
of
unflawed
purity
and
such
influences
here
embodied
in
the
symbol
of
a
song
are
among
the
precious
realities
of
our
life
nowhere
in
literature
has
the
virtue
of
mere
innocent
gladness
been
more
charmingly
imagined
than
in
her
morning
outbreak
of
expectancy
half
animal
glee
half
spiritual
joy
the
whole
sunrise
not
to
be
suppressed
is
a
limitless
splendour
but
the
reflected
beam
cast
up
from
the
splash
of
her
ewer
and
dancing
on
her
poor
ceiling
is
the
same
in
kind
in
the
up

great
exotic
blooms

has
not
pippa
her
one
martagon
lily
over

queens

all

ranks

same

she
shall
serve
him
all
this
long
day
by
gaiety
and
gratitude
is
a
sequence
of
dramatic
scenes
with
lyrics
interspersed
and
placed
in
a
lyrical
setting
the
figures
dark
or
bright
of
the
painting
are
ringed
by
a
flowery
bowery
of
song
but
before
his
and
were
brought
to
a
close
browning
had
discovered
in
the
short
monodrama
lyrical
or
reflective
the
most
appropriate
vehicle
for
his
powers
of
passion
and
of
thought
here
a
single
situation
sufficed
characters
were
seen
rightly
in
position
the
action
of
the
piece
was
wholly
internal
a
passion
could
be
isolated
and
could
be
either
traced
through
its
varying
moods
or
seized
in
its
moment
of
culmination
the
casuistry
of
the
brain
could
be
studied
apart
it
might
have
its
say
uninterrupted
or
it
might
be
suddenly
encountered
and
dissipated
by
some
spearlike
beam
of
light
from
the
heart
or
soul
the
traditions
of
a
great
literary
form
were
not
here
a
cause
of
embarrassment
they
need
not
as
in
work
for
the
theatre
be
laboriously
observed
or
injuriously
violated
the
poet
might
assert
his
independence
and
be
wholly
original
and
original
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
entirely
true
to
his
highest
self
browning
was
in
the
dramatic
lyrics
of
and
the
dramatic
romances
and
lyrics
of
his
senses
were
at
once
singularly
keen
and
energetic
and
singularly
capacious
of
delight
his
eyes
were
active
instruments
of
observation
and
at
the
same
time
were
possessed
by
a
kind
of
rapture
in
form
and
not
least
in
fantastic
form
and
a
rapture
still
finer
in
the
opulence
and
variety
of
colour
in
these
poems
we
are
caught
into
what
may
truly
be
called
an
enthusiasm
of
the
senses
and
presently
we
find
that
the
senses
good
for
their
own
sakes
are
good
also
as
inlets
to
the
spirit
having
returned
from
his
first
visit
to
southern
italy
the
sights
and
sounds
striking
upon
the
retina
and
the
auditory
nerve
with
the
intensity
of
a
new
experience

attack
the
eye

in

their
eager
obsession

ringlets

browning
did
not
rejoice
in
perfect
health
and
animal
spirits
and
in
the
letters
to
miss
barrett
we
hear
of
frequent
headaches
and
find
a
reference
to
his
pale
thin
face
as
seen
in
a
mirror

had
certainly
the
imagination
of
perfect
vitality
and
of
those
wild
joys
of
living
sung
by
the
young
harper
david
in
that
poem
of

appeared
as
a
fragment
in
the

and
as
a
whole

years
later

and
rapture
of
the
spirit
rising
above
the
rapture
of
the
senses
of
these
poems

was
written
in
the
spirit

play

required

the

incarnations
of
the
wines

are
no
more
than
clever
caprices
of
the
fancy
one
lost
remotely
suggested
by
the
conservatism
of
wordsworth
elder
days
but
possibly
deflected
by
some
of
the
feeling
attributed
to
pym
in
relation
to
strafford
of
the
drama
and
certainly
detached
from
direct
personal
reference
to
wordsworth
expresses
browning
liberal
sentiment
in
politics
one
the
stately
is
the
sole
remaining
fragment
of
a
classical
drama
hippolytus
and
aricia
composed
in
much
against
my
endeavour
wrote
the
poet
a
somewhat
enigmatical
phrase
while
in
bed
with
a
fever
a
considerable
number
of
the
poems
may
be
grouped
together
as
expressions
or
demonstrations
of
various
passions
central
among
which
is
the
passion
of
love
a
few
and
these
conspicuous
for
their
masterly
handling
of
novel
themes
treat
of
art
and
the
feeling
for
art
as
seen
in
the
painter
of
pictures
or
in
the
connoisseur
nor
is
the
interpretation
of
religious
emotion
though
in
a
phase
that
may
be
called
abnormal
wholly
forgotten
with
every
passion
that
expands
the
spirit
beyond
the
bounds
of
self
browning
as
the
dramas
have
made
evident
to
us
is
in
cordial
sympathy
the
reckless
loyalty
with
its
animal
spirits
and
its
dash
of
grief
the
bitterer
because
grief
must
be
dismissed
of
the
is
true
to
england
and
to
the
time
in
its
heartiness
and
gallant
bluffness
the
of
pride
and
joy
in
a
boy
heart
at
the
moment
of
death
in
his
emperor
cause
could
hardly
be
more
intensely
imagined
than
it
is
in
the
poem
of
the
french
camp
and
all
is
made
more
real
and
vivid
by
the
presence
of
that
motionless
figure
intent
on
victory
and
sustaining
the
weight
of
imperial
anxieties
which
yet
can
not
be
quite
impassive
in
presence
of
a
death
so
devoted
and
side
by
side
with
this
poem
of
generous
enthusiasm
is
placed
the
poem
of
passion
reduced
to
its
extreme
of
meanness
its
most
contracted
form
of
petty
spite
and
base
envy
the
in
a
spanish
a
grotesque
insect
spitting
ineffectual
poison
is
placed
under
the
of
the
comic
spirit
and
is
discovered
to
be
a
brother
in
religion
a
noble
hatred
transcending
personal
considerations
mingles
with
a
noble
and
solemn
love
the
passion
of
country
in
the
italian
exile
record
of
his
escape
from
austrian
pursuers
with
the
of
his
patriotic
melancholy
mingles
the
proud
recollection
of
the
italian
woman
who
was
his
saviour
over
whose
conjectured
happiness
as
peasant
wife
and
peasant
mother
the
exile
bows
with
a
tender
joy
the
examples
of
abnormal
passion
are
two
that
of
the
amorous
homicide
who
would
set
on
one
perfect
moment
the
seal
of
eternity
in
and
that
of
the
other
occupier
of
the
cells
johannes
agricola
whose
passion
of
religion
is
pushed
to
the
extreme
of
a
mystical
antinomianism
browning
poems
of
the
love
of
man
and
woman
are
seldom
a
simple
lyrical
cry
but
they
are
not
on
this
account
the
less
true
in
their
presentment
of
that
curious
masquer
and
disguiser
love
when
love
takes
possession
of
a
nature
which
is
complex
affluents
and
tributaries
from
many
and
various
faculties
run
into
the
main
stream
with
browning
the
passion
is
indeed
a
regal
power
but
intellect
imagination
fancy
are
its
for
a
time
then
in
a
moment
it
resumes
all
authority
into
its
own
hands
resolves
of
a
sudden
all
that
is
complex
into
the
singleness
of
joy
or
pain
fuses
all
that
is
manifold
into
the
unity
of
its
own
life
and
being
his
dramatic
method
requires
that
each
single
faculty
should
be
seen
in
the
environment
of
a
character
and
that
its
operations
should
be
clothed
more
or
less
in
circumstance
and
since
love
has
its
ingenuities
its
and
threads
of
association
its
occult
symbolisms
browning
knows
how
to
press
into
the
service
of
the
central
emotion
objects
and
incidents
and
imagery
which
may
seem
remote
or
curious
or
fantastic
or
trivial
or
even
grotesque
in
to
the
lady
of
love
which
cometh
by
the
hearing
of
the
ear
for
rudel
is
a
who
has
never
seen
his
sun
is
a
pure
imaginative
devotion
to
the
ideal
in
love
is
the
deliverer
the
motive
of
the
poem
is
essentially
that
of
the
perseus
and
andromeda
myth
refined
upon
and
mediaevalised
in
love
is
the
interpreter
of
life
a
moment
of
high
passion
explains
and
explains
away
all
else
that
would
obscure
the
vision
of
what
is
best
and
most
real
in
this
our
world
and
in
the
worlds
that
are
yet
unattained
from
a
few
lines
written
to
illustrate
a
venetian
picture
by
maclise
a
was
evolved
if
browning
was
not
entirely
accurate
in
his
topography
of
venice
he
certainly
did
not
fail
in
his
sense
of
the
depth
and
opulence
of
its
colour
here
the
abandonment
to
passion
is
relieved
by
the
quaint
ingenuities
and
fancies
of
love
that
seeks
a
momentary
refuge
from
its
own
excess
and
then
returns
more
eagerly
upon
itself
and
the
shadow
of
death
is
ever
at
hand
but
like
the
shadows
of
a
venetian
painter
it
glows
with
colour
the
motives
of
two
narrative
poems
and
flight
of
the
have
much
in
common
they
lie
in
the
contrast
between
the
world
of
convention
and
the
world
of
reality
in
each
the
insulter
of
proprieties
the
breaker
of
bounds
is
a
woman
in
each
the
choice
lies
between
a
life
of
pretended
love
and
vain
dignities
and
a
life
of
freedom
and
true
love
and
in
each
case
the
woman
makes
her
glad
escape
from
what
is
false
to
what
is
true
in
restating
the
incident
of
the
glove
browning
brings
into
play
his
casuistry
but
casuistry
is
here
used
to
justify
a
passion
which
the
poet
approves
to
elucidate
not
to
obscure
what
he
represents
as
the
truth
of
the
situation
flight
of
the

part

its
rise
from
a
line
the
queen
of
the

a
boy
heard
a
woman
singing

some
two
hundred
lines
were
given
to
hood
for
his
magazine
at
a
time
when
hood
needed
help
and
death
was
approaching
him
the
poem
was
completed
some
months
later
it
is
written
like
in
verse
that
runs
for
swiftness
sake
and
that
is
pleased
to
show
its
paces
on
a
road
rough
with
rhymes
the
little
duchess
is
a
wild
bird
caged
in
the
strangely
twisted
wirework
of
artificial
modes

many
months
actually
delivered
from
her
cage
in
wimpole
street
and
robert
browning
himself
growing
in

amid
his
incantations
played
the
part
of
the
gipsy

further
than
a
misplaced
smile

it
tightens

never
was
an
agony
hinted
with
more
gentlemanly
reserve
but
the
poem
is
remarkable
chiefly
as
gathering
up
into
a
typical
representative
a
whole
phase
of
civilisation
the
duke
is
italian
of
renaissance
days
insensible
in
his
egoistic
pride
to
the
beautiful
humanity
alive
before
him
yet
a
connoisseur

after
all

the
glory
of
his
possessions
must
not

pressed
as
though
his

hundred
years
old
name
were
not
enough
the
true
gift
of
art
browning
in
later
poems
frequently
insists
upon
this
is
not
for
the
connoisseur
or
collector
who
rests
in
a
material
possession
but
for
the
artist
who
in
the
zeal
of
creation
presses
through
his
own
work
to
that
unattainable
beauty
that
flying
joy
which
exists
beyond
his
grasp
and
for
ever
lures
him
forward
in
the
earliest
study
in
his
lives
of
the
painters

made
by
the
poet
the
world
is
gross
its
touch
unsanctifies
the
sanctities
of
art
yet
the
brave
audacity
of
genius
is
able
to
penetrate
this
gross
world
with
spiritual
fire
browning
unknown
painter

a
delicate
spirit
who
dares
not
mingle
his
soul
with
the
gross
world
he
has
failed
for
lack
of
a
robust
faith
a
strenuous
courage
but
his
failure
is
beautiful

pathetic

a

a

by

in

article
browning
in

browning
seemed
as
full
of
dramatic
interest
in
reading
a
balcony
as
if
he
had
just
written
it
for
our
benefit
one
who
sat
near
him
said
that
it
was
a
natural
sequence
that
the
step
of
the
guard
should
be
heard
coming
to
take
norbert
to
his
doom

sterile

vengeance
swift

would
follow
on
the

quite
think

browning

out

a
large

passionate
temperament

had
only

interpret
it

it

father
house
in
wimpole
street
occupied
upon
her
sofa
with
her
books
and
papers
her
greek
dramatists
and
her
elizabethan
poets
shut
out
from
the
world
with
windows
for
ever
closed
and
with
only
an
occasional
female
visitor
to
gossip
of
the
social
and
literary
life
of
london
never
was
a
spirit
of
more
vivid
fire
enclosed
within
a
tomb
the
letter
from
browning
the
author
of
and
king
of
the
mystics
threw
her
she
says
into
ecstasics
her
reply
has
a
thrill
of
pleasure
running
through
its
graceful
and
she
holds
out
a
hope
that
when
spring
shall
arrive
a
meeting
in
the
invalid
chamber
between
her
and
her
new
correspondent
may
be
possible

browning
a

chalk
field
talfourd
the
national
portrait
from
the
first
a
headlong
yet
delicate
speed
was
in
her
pen
from
the
first
there
was
much
to
say
oh
for
a
horse
with
wings
mr
browning
who
had
praised
her
poems
must
tell
her
their
faults
he
must
himself
speak
out
in
noble
verse
not
merely
utter
himself
through
the
masks
of
can
she
as
he
alleges
really
help
him
by
her
sympathy
by
her
counsel
let
him
put
ceremony
aside
and
treat
her
bon
he
will
find
her
an
honest
man
on
the
whole
she
intends
to
set
about
knowing
him
as
much
as
possible
immediately
what
poets
have
been
his
literary
sponsors
are
not
the
critics
wrong
to
deny
contemporary
genius
what
poems
are
those
now
in
his
portfolio
is
not
√¶schylus
the
divinest
of
divine
greek
spirits
but
how
inadequately
her
correspondent
has
spoken
of
dante
shall
they
indeed
as
he
suggests
write
something
together
and
then
is
he
duly
careful
of
his
health
careful
against
overwork
and
is
not
gladness
a
duty
to
give
back
to
the
world
the
joy
that
god
has
given
to
his
poet
though
indeed
to
lean
out
of
the
window
of
this
house
of
life
is
for
some
the
required
perhaps
the
happiest
attitude
and
why
replies
the
second
voice
lean
out
of
the
window
his
own
foot
is
only
on
the
stair
where
are
the
faults
of
her
poems
of
which
she
had
inquired
yes
he
will
speak
out
and
he
is
now
planning
such
a
poem
as
she
demands
but
she
it
is
who
has
indeed
spoken
out
in
her
verse
in
his
portfolio
is
a
drama
about
a
moor
of
othello
country
one
luria
with
strange
entanglings
among
his
florentines
see
this
and
this
how
grandly
it
is
said
in
the
greek
of
eschylus
but
dante
all
dante
is
in
his
heart
and
head
and
he
has
seen
tennyson
face
to
face
and
he
knows
and
loves
carlyle
and
he
has
visited
sorrento
and
trod
upon
monte
calvano
oh
the
world
in
this
year
must
be
studied
though
solitude
is
best
he
has
been
polking
all
night
and
walked
home
while
the
morning
thrushes
piped
and
it
is
true
that
his
head
aches
she
shall
read
and
amend
his
manuscript
poems
to
hear
from
her
is
better
than
to
see
anybody
else
but
when
shall
he
see
her
too
so
proceed
from
january
to
may
the
letters
of
rudel
and
the
still
invisible
lady
of
wimpole
street
it
was
happy
comradeship
on
her
part
but
on
his
it
was
already
love
his
spirit
had
recognised
had
touched
a
spirit
which
included
all
that
he
most
needed
and
union
with
which
would
be
the
most
certain
and
substantial
prize
offered
by
life
there
was
nothing
fatuous
in
this
inward
assurance
it
was
the
simplest
and
most
truth
the
word
mistrustful
do
not
see
me
as
long
as
you
are
mistrustful
of
with
its
implied
appeal
to
her
generous
confidence
precipitated
the
visit
how
could
she
be
mistrustful
of
course
he
may
come
but
the
wish
to
do
so
was
unwisely
exorbitant
on
the
afternoon
of
may
browning
first
set
eyes
on
his
future
wife
a
little
figure
which
did
not
rise
from
the
sofa
pale
ringleted
face
great
eager
wistfully
pathetic
eyes
he
believed
that
she
was
suffering
from
some
incurable
disease
of
the
spine
and
that
whatever
remained
to
her
of
life
must
be
spent
in
this
prostrate
manner
of
an
invalid
a
movement
of
what
can
only
be
imperfectly
described
as
pity
entered
into
his
feeling
for
her
it
was
less
pity
than
the
joy
of
believing
that
he
could
confer
as
well
as
receive
but
his
first
thought
on
leaving
was
only
the
fear
that
he
might
have
stayed
too
long
or
might
have
spoken
too
loud
the
visit
was
on
tuesday
on
thursday
browning
wrote
the
only
letter
of
the
correspondence
which
has
been
destroyed
one
which
overflowed
with
gratitude
and
was
immediately
and
rightly
interpreted
by
the
receiver
as
tending
towards
an
offer
implied
here
but
not
expressed
of
marriage
it
was
read
in
pain
and
agitation
her
heart
indeed
but
not
her
will
was
shaken
and
after
a
sleepless
night
she
wrote
words
effective
to
bar
as
she
believed
all
further
advance
in
a
direction
fatal
to
his
happiness
the
intemperate
things
he
had
said
must
be
wholly
forgotten
between
them
or
else
she
will
not
see
him
again
friends
comrades
in
the
life
of
the
intellect
they
might
continue
to
be
for
once
and
once
only
browning
lied
to
miss
barrett
and
he
lied
a
little
awkwardly
his
letter
was
only
one
of
too
boisterous
gratitude
his
punishment
that
of
one
infinitely
her
inferior
was
undeserved
let
her
return
to
him
the
offending
letter
returned
accordingly
it
was
and
immediately
destroyed
by
the
writer
in
happier
days
miss
barrett
hoped
to
recover
what
then
would
have
been
added
to
a
hoard
which
she
treasured
but
browning
could
not
preserve
the
words
which
she
had
condemned
wise
smile
at
each
other
gently
and
graciously
when
a
lover
is
commanded
to
withdraw
and
to
reappear
in
the
character
of
a
friend
an
incoming
tide
may
seem
for
a
while
to
pause
but
by
and
by
we
look
and
the
rock
is
covered
browning
very
dutifully
submitted
and
became
a
literary
counsellor
and
comrade
the
first
stadium
in
the
progress
of
his
fortunes
opened
in
january
and
closed
before
the
end
of
may
the
second
closed
at
the
end
of
august
to
a
friend
miss
barrett
assured
that
he
never
could
be
more
might
well
be
generous
visits
were
permitted
and
it
was
left
to
browning
to
fix
the
days
the
postal
shuttle
threw
swift
and
swifter
threads
between
new
cross
hatcham
and
wimpole
street
the
verse
of
tennyson
the
novels
of
george
sand
were
discussed
her
translations
from
the
greek
were
considered
his
manuscript
poems
were
left
for
her
corrections
but
transcription
must
not
weary
him
into
headaches
she
would
herself
by
and
by
act
as
an
amanuensis
each
of
the
correspondents
could
not
rest
happy
until
the
other
had
been
proved
to
be
in
every
intellectual
and
moral
quality
the
superior
browning
praise
could
not
be
withheld
it
seemed
to
his
friend
and
she
wrote
always
with
crystalline
sincerity
to
be
an
illusion
which
humbled
her
glad
memories
of
italy
sad
memories
of
england
and
the
invalid
life
were
exchanged
there
is
nothing
that
she
can
teach
him
she
declares
except
grief
and
yet
to
him
the
day
of
his
visit
is
his
light
through
the
dark
week
he
is
like
an
eastern
jew
who
creeps
through
alleys
in
the
meanest
garb
destitute
to
all
eyes
who
yet
possesses
a
hidden
of
marble
and
gold
even
in
matters
ecclesiastical
the
footsteps
of
the
two
friends
had
moved
with
one
consent
each
of
them
preferred
a
chapel
to
a
church
each
was
puritan
in
a
love
of
simplicity
in
the
things
of
religion
each
disowned
the
puritan
narrowness
and
the
grey
aridity
of
certain
schools
of
dissent
on
june
with
the
warranty
of
her
published
poem
which
had
told
of
flowers
sent
in
a
letter
browning
encloses
in
his
envelope
a
yellow
rose
and
again
and
again
summer
flowers
arrive
bringing
colour
and
sweetness
into
the
dim
city
room
once
miss
barrett
can
report
that
she
has
been
out
of
doors
and
with
no
yet
unable
to
venture
in
the
carriage
as
far
as
the
park
still
her
bodily
strength
is
no
better
than
that
of
a
tired
bird
she
is
moreover
years
older
than
her
friend
the
difference
was
in
fact
that
between
and
and
the
thunder
of
a
july
storm
has
shaken
her
nerves
there
is
some
thought
of
her
seeking
health
as
far
off
as
malta
or
even
alexandria
but
her
father
will
jestingly
have
it
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
her
except
obstinacy
and
dry
toast
thus
cordially
gladly
sadly
and
always
with
quick
leapings
of
the
indomitable
flame
of
the
spirit
these
letters
of
friend
to
friend
run
on
during
the
midsummer
days
browning
was
willing
and
happy
to
wait
a
confidence
possessed
him
that
in
the
end
he
would
be
known
fully
and
aright
on
august
came
a
great
outpouring
of
feeling
from
miss
barrett
she
took
her
friend
so
far
into
her
confidence
as
to
speak
plainly
of
the
household
difficulties
caused
by
her
father
autocratic
temper
the
conversation
was
immediately
followed
by
a
letter
in
which
she
endeavoured
to
soften
or
qualify
the
impression
her
words
had
given
and
her
heart
now
astir
and
craving
sympathy
led
her
on
to
write
of
her
most
sorrowful
and
sacred
memories
those
connected
with
her
death
browning
was
deeply
moved
most
grateful
for
her
trust
in
him
but
she
had
forbidden
him
to
notice
the
record
of
her
grief
he
longed
to
return
confidence
with
confidence
to
tell
what
was
urgent
in
his
heart
but
the
bar
of
three
months
since
had
not
been
removed
and
he
hesitated
to
speak
his
two
days
silence
was
unintelligible
to
his
friend
and
caused
her
inexpressible
anxiety
could
any
words
of
hers
have
displeased
him
or
was
he
seriously
unwell
she
wrote
on
august
a
little
letter
asking
the
alms
of
just
one
line
to
relieve
her
fears
when
are
loosened
a
breath
will
bring
down
the
avalanche
it
was
impossible
to
receive
this
appeal
and
not
to
declare
briefly
decisively
his
unqualified
trust
in
her
his
entire
devotion
his
assured
knowledge
of
what
would
constitute
his
supreme
happiness
miss
barrett
reply
is
perfect
in
its
disinterested
of
his
freedom
and
his
future
good
as
she
conceived
it
she
is
deeply
grateful
but
she
can
not
allow
him
to
empty
his
into
the
sand
what
could
she
give
that
it
would
not
be
ungenerous
to
give
yet
his
part
has
not
been
altogether
the
harder
of
the
two
the
subject
must
be
left
such
subjects
however
could
not
be
left
until
the
facts
were
ascertained
browning
would
not
urge
her
a
step
beyond
her
actual
feelings
but
he
must
know
whether
her
refusal
was
based
solely
on
her
view
of
his
supposed
interests
and
with
the
true
delicacy
of
frankness
she
admits
that
even
the
sense
of
her
own
unworthiness
is
not
the
insuperable
obstacle
no
but
is
she
not
a
confirmed
invalid
she
thought
that
she
had
done
living
when
he
came
and
sought
her
out
if
he
would
be
wise
all
these
thoughts
of
her
must
be
abandoned
such
an
answer
brought
a
great
calm
to
browning
heart
he
did
not
desire
to
press
her
further
let
things
rest
it
is
for
her
to
judge
if
what
she
regards
as
an
obstacle
should
be
removed
she
will
certainly
then
act
in
his
best
interests
to
himself
this
matter
of
health
creates
no
difficulty
to
sit
by
her
for
an
hour
a
day
to
write
out
what
was
in
him
for
the
world
and
so
to
save
his
soul
would
be
to
attain
his
ideal
in
life
what
woman
would
not
be
moved
to
the
inmost
depths
by
such
words
she
insists
that
his
noble
extravagances
must
in
no
wise
bind
him
but
all
the
bitternesses
of
life
have
been
taken
away
from
her
henceforth
she
is
his
for
everything
except
to
do
him
harm
the
future
rests
with
god
and
with
him
and
amid
the
letters
containing
these
grave
sentences
so
full
of
fate
first
appears
a
reference
to
the
pet
name
of
her
childhood
the
ba
which
is
all
that
here
serves
like
swift
little
language
to
indulge
a
foolish
tenderness
and
the
translator
of
is
able
to
put
greek
characters
to
their
most
delightful
use
in
her
greek
o
philtate
in
of
the
middle
age
the
allegorical
personage
named
danger
plays
a
considerable
part
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
danger
too
often
signified
a
husband
in
wimpole
street
that
alarming
personage
always
meant
a
father
edward
moulton
barrett
was
a
man
of
integrity
in
business
of
fortitude
in
adversity
of
a
certain
stern
piety
and
from
the
superior
position
of
a
domestic
autocrat
he
could
even
indulge
himself
in
occasional
fiats
of
affection
we
need
not
question
that
there
were
springs
of
water
in
the
rock
and
in
earlier
days
they
had
flowed
freely
but
now
if
at
night
he
visited
his
ailing
daughter
room
for
a
few
minutes
and
prayed
with
her
and
for
her
it
meant
that
on
such
an
occasion
she
was
not
too
criminal
to
merit
the
pious
intercession
if
he
called
her
puss
it
meant
that
she
had
not
recently
been
an
undutiful
child
of
or
forty
years
old
a
probably
rewards
his
educated
dogs
and
horses
with
like
amiable
familiarities
and
he
is
probably
regarded
by
his
troupe
with
affection
mingled
with
awe
mr
barrett
had
been
appointed
by
the
divine
authority
of
parentage
no
one
visited
wimpole
street
where
there
were
sons
as
well
as
daughters
without
special
permission
from
the
lord
of
the
castle
he
authorised
the
visits
of
mr
browning
the
poet
being
fondly
assured
that
mr
browning
intentions
were
not
those
of
a
burglar
or
worse
an
amorous
if
any
daughter
of
his
conceived
the
possibility
of
transferring
her
prime
love
and
loyalty
from
himself
to
another
she
was
even
as
aholah
and
aholibah
who
doted
upon
the
assyrians
captains
and
rulers
clothed
most
gorgeously
all
of
them
desirable
young
men
if
a
prince
of
eldorado
said
elizabeth
barrett
to
her
sister
arabel
should
come
with
a
pedigree
of
lineal
descent
from
some
signory
in
the
moon
in
one
hand
and
a
ticket
of
good
behaviour
from
the
nearest
independent
chapel
in
the
other
why
even
then
interrupted
arabel
it
would
not
one
admirable
trait
however
mr
moulton
barrett
did
possess
he
was
nearly
always
away
from
home
till
six
the
design
that
miss
barrett
should
winter
abroad
was
still
under
consideration
but
the
place
now
fixed
upon
was
pisa
suddenly
in
she
finds
herself
obliged
to
announce
that
it
is
all
over
with
pisa
her
father
had
vetoed
the
undutiful
project
and
had
ceased
to
pay
her
his
evening
visits
only
in
his
separate
and
private
orisons
were
all
her
sins
remembered
to
admit
the
fact
that
he
did
not
love
her
enough
to
give
her
a
chance
of
recovery
was
bitter
yet
it
could
not
be
denied
her
life
was
now
a
thing
of
value
to
herself
for
it
was
precious
to
another
she
beat
against
the
bars
of
her
cage
planned
a
rebellious
flight
made
inquiries
respecting
ships
and
berths
but
she
could
not
travel
alone
and
she
would
not
subject
either
of
her
sisters
to
the
heavy
displeasure
of
the
ruler
of
the
house
robert
browning
held
strong
opinions
on
the
duty
of
resisting
evil
and
if
evil
assume
the
guise
of
parental
authority
it
is
none
the
he
believed
to
be
resisted
to
submit
to
the
will
of
another
is
often
easy
to
act
on
one
own
best
judgment
is
hard
our
faculties
were
given
us
to
put
to
use
to
be
passively
obedient
is
really
to
evade
probation
so
with
almost
excessive
emphasis
browning
set
forth
a
cardinal
article
of
his
creed
but
elizabeth
barrett
was
not
like
him
ever
a
fighter
and
after
all
london
in
was
not
bleak
and
grey
as
it
had
been
a
year
previously
for
reasons
to
adopt
a
reiterated
word
of
the
correspondence
for
reasons
on
two
later
occasions
browning
sang
the
same
against
the
enemies
of
god
and
with
a
little
too
much
vehemence
not
to
say
truculence
as
is
the
way
with
earnest
believers
his
gentler
correspondent
could
not
tolerate
the
thought
of
duelling
and
she
disapproved
of
punishment
by
death
browning
argues
that
for
one
who
values
the
good
opinion
of
society
not
for
himself
that
good
opinion
is
a
possession
which
may
like
other
possessions
be
defended
at
the
risk
of
a
man
life
and
as
for
capital
punishment
is
not
evil
to
be
suppressed
at
any
price
is
not
a
miscreant
to
be
expelled
out
of
world
the
difference
of
opinion
was
the
first
that
had
arisen
between
the
friends
and
browning
words
carried
with
them
a
certain
sense
of
pain
in
the
thought
that
they
could
in
any
thing
stand
apart
happily
the
theoretical
had
faith
superior
to
his
own
arguments
faith
in
a
woman
insight
as
finer
than
his
own
and
he
is
let
off
with
a
gratified
rebuke
for
preternatural
submissiveness
and
for
arraying
her
in
pontifical
garments
of
authority
which
hang
loose
upon
so
small
a
figure
the
other
application
of
his
doctrine
of
resisting
evil
was
even
more
trying
to
her
feelings
and
the
preacher
was
instant
certainly
out
of
season
not
the
least
important
personage
in
the
wimpole
street
house
was
miss
barrett
devoted
companion
flush
loyal
and
loving
to
his
mistress
flushie
always
was
yet
to
his
lot
some
canine
errors
fell
he
eyed
a
visitor
umbrella
with
suspicion
he
resented
perhaps
the
presence
of
a
rival
he
did
not
behave
nicely
to
a
poet
who
had
not
written
verses
in
his
honour
for
which
he
was
duly
rebuked
by
his
mistress
the
punishment
was
not
capital
and
was
propitiated
with
bags
of
cakes
by
the
intruder
when
the
day
for
their
flight
drew
near
miss
barrett
proposed
somewhat
timidly
that
her
maid
wilson
should
accompany
her
to
italy
but
she
was
gratefully
confident
that
flush
could
not
be
left
behind
just
at
this
anxious
moment
a
dreadful
thing
befell
a
gang
of
presided
over
by
the
taylor
bore
flushie
away
into
the
horror
of
some
obscure
and
vulgar
london
alley
he
was
a
difficult
dog
to
capture
and
his
ransom
must
be
in
proportion
to
his
resistance
there
was
a
terrible
tradition
of
a
lady
who
had
haggled
about
the
sum
demanded
and
had
received
her
dog
head
in
a
parcel
miss
barrett
was
eager
to
part
with
her
six
guineas
and
rescue
her
faithful
companion
from
misery
was
this
an
occasion
for
preaching
from
ethical
heights
the
sin
of
making
a
composition
with
yet
browning
still
a
fighter
and
armed
with
desperate
logic
must
needs
declaim
vehemently
against
the
iniquity
of
such
a
bargain
it
is
something
to
rejoice
at
that
he
was
dexterously
worsted
in
argument
being
compelled
to
admit
that
if
italian
banditti
were
to
carry
off
his
ba
he
would
pay
down
every
farthing
he
might
have
in
the
world
to
recover
her
and
this
before
he
entered
on
that
chase
of
fifty
years
which
was
not
to
terminate
until
he
had
shot
down
with
his
own
hand
the
receiver
of
the
infamous
bribe
the
journey
of
miss
barrett
to
pisa
having
been
for
the
present
abandoned
friendship
now
acknowledged
to
be
more
than
friendship
resumed
its
accustomed
ways
visits
it
was
agreed
were
not
to
be
too
frequent
three
in
each
fortnight
might
prudently
be
ventured
but
wednesday
might
have
to
be
exchanged
for
thursday
or
saturday
for
monday
if
on
the
first
elected
day
miss
mitford
dear
and
generous
friend
threatened
to
come
with
her
talk
talk
talk
or
mrs
jameson
with
her
drawings
and
or
some
unknown
who
had
thrown
her
toils
or
kindly
mr
kenyon
who
knew
of
visits
and
who
when
he
called
would
peer
through
his
spectacles
with
an
air
of
excessive
penetration
or
too
extreme
unconsciousness
and
there
were
times
later
on
when
an
avalanche
of
aunts
and
uncles
would
precipitate
itself
on
wimpole
street
perspicacious
aunts
and
amiable
uncles
who
were
wished
as
far
off
as
seringapatam
and
who
wrung
from
an
impatient
niece
to
whom
indeed
they
were
dear
the
cry
the
barbarians
are
upon
us
miss
barrett
sisters
the
gentle
henrietta
who
preferred
a
waltz
to
the
best
sermon
of
an
independent
minister
and
the
more
serious
arabel
who
preferred
the
sermon
of
an
independent
minister
to
the
best
waltz
were
informed
of
the
actual
state
of
affairs
they
were
trustworthy
and
sympathetic
henrietta
had
special
reasons
of
her
own
for
sympathy
captain
surtees
cook
who
afterwards
became
her
husband
might
be
discussing
affairs
with
her
in
the
at
the
same
time
that
mr
browning
the
poet
the
man
of
the
pomegranates
as
he
was
named
by
mr
barrett
held
converse
on
literature
with
elizabeth
in
the
upper
chamber
the
household
was
honeycombed
with
treasons
for
the
humours
of
superficial
situations
and
passing
incidents
miss
barrett
had
a
lively
sense
and
she
found
some
relief
in
playing
with
them
but
with
a
nature
essentially
truthful
like
hers
the
necessity
of
concealment
was
a
cause
of
distress
the
position
was
no
less
painful
to
browning
and
in
the
end
it
became
intolerable
yet
while
there
were
obstructions
and
winding
ways
in
the
shallows
in
the
depths
were
flawless
truth
and
inviolable
love
what
sentimental
persons
fancy
and
grow
effusive
over
was
here
the
simplest
and
yet
always
a
miraculous
reality
he
of
the
heavens
and
earth
brought
us
together
so
wonderfully
holding
two
souls
in
his
hand
in
the
most
illuminating
words
of
each
correspondent
no
merely
private
or
peculiar
feeling
is
expressed
it
is
the
common
wave
of
human
passion
the
common
love
of
man
and
woman
that
here
leaps
from
the
depths
to
the
height
and
over
which
the
iris
of
beauty
ever
and
anon
appears
with
it
is
true
an
unusual
intensity
and
so
in
reading
the
letters
we
have
no
sense
of
prying
into
secrets
there
are
no
secrets
to
be
discovered
what
is
most
intimate
is
most
common
only
here
what
is
most
common
rises
up
to
its
highest
point
of
attainment
i
never
thought
of
being
happy
through
you
or
by
you
or
in
you
even
your
good
was
all
my
idea
of
good
and
let
me
be
too
near
to
be
seen
once
i
used
to
be
more
uneasy
and
to
think
that
i
ought
to
you
see
me
but
love
is
better
than
sight
i
love
your
love
too
much
and
is
the
worst
fault
my
beloved
i
can
ever
find
in
my
love
of
these
are
sentences
that
tell
of
what
can
be
no
private
possession
being
as
liberal
and
free
as
our
light
and
air
and
if
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
appears
appears
and
passes
away
it
is
a
shadow
that
has
floated
over
many
other
hearts
beside
that
of
the
writer
how
dreadfully
natural
it
would
be
to
me
seem
to
me
if
you
leave
off
loving
me
how
it
would
be
like
the
sun
setting
and
no
more
wonder
only
more
darkness
the
old
exchange
of
tokens
the
old
symbolisms
a
lock
of
hair
a
ring
a
picture
a
child
penholder
are
good
enough
for
these
lovers
as
they
had
been
for
others
before
them
what
is
diffused
through
many
of
the
letters
is
gathered
up
and
is
delivered
from
the
alloy
of
superficial
circumstance
in
the
sonnets
from
the
portuguese
in
reading
which
we
are
in
the
presence
of
womanhood
womanhood
delivered
from
death
by
love
and
from
darkness
by
light
as
much
as
in
that
of
an
individual
woman
and
the
disclosure
in
poems
and
in
letters
being
without
reserve
affects
us
as
no
disclosure
but
simply
as
an
adequate
expression
of
the
truth
universal
one
obstacle
to
the
prospective
marriage
was
steadily
diminishing
in
magnitude
miss
barrett
with
a
new
joy
in
life
new
hopes
new
interests
gained
in
health
and
strength
from
month
to
month
the
winter
of
was
unusually
mild
in
january
one
day
she
walked
walked
and
was
not
carried
downstairs
to
the
spring
came
early
that
year
in
the
first
week
of
february
lilacs
and
hawthorn
were
in
bud
elders
in
leaf
thrushes
and
in
full
song
in
april
miss
barrett
gave
pledges
of
her
confidence
in
the
future
by
buying
a
bonnet
a
little
like
a
quaker
it
seemed
to
her
but
the
learned
pronounced
it
fashionable
early
in
may
that
bonnet
with
its
owner
and
arabel
and
flush
appeared
in
regent
park
while
sunshine
was
filtering
through
the
leaves
the
invalid
left
her
carriage
set
foot
upon
the
green
grass
reached
up
and
plucked
a
little
laburnum
blossom
for
reasons
saw
the
strange
people
moving
about
like
phantoms
of
life
and
felt
that
she
alone
and
the
idea
of
one
who
was
absent
were
real
and
flush
she
adds
with
a
touch
of
remorse
and
flush
a
little
too
many
drives
and
walks
followed
at
the
end
of
may
she
feloniously
gathered
some
pansies
the
flowers
of
paracelsus
and
this
notwithstanding
the
protest
of
arabel
in
the
botanical
gardens
and
felt
the
unspeakable
beauty
of
the
common
grass
later
in
the
year
wild
roses
were
found
at
hampstead
and
on
a
memorable
day
the
invalid
almost
perfect
in
health
was
guided
by
kind
and
learned
mrs
jameson
through
the
pictures
and
statues
of
the
poet
collection
on
yet
another
occasion
it
was
mr
kenyon
who
drove
her
to
see
the
strange
new
sight
of
the
great
western
train
coming
in
the
spectators
procured
chairs
but
the
rush
of
people
and
the
of
the
engine
almost
overcame
miss
barrett
nerves
which
on
a
later
trial
shrank
also
from
the
more
harmonious
thunder
of
the
organ
of
the
abbey
sundays
came
when
she
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
sitting
if
not
in
a
pew
at
least
in
the
secluded
vestry
of
a
chapel
and
joining
unseen
in
those
simple
forms
of
prayer
and
praise
which
she
valued
most
altogether
something
like
a
miracle
in
the
healing
of
the
sick
had
been
effected
money
difficulty
there
was
none
browning
it
is
true
was
not
in
a
position
to
undertake
the
expenses
of
even
such
a
simple
household
economy
as
they
both
desired
he
was
prepared
to
seek
for
any
honourable
service
diplomatic
or
other
if
that
were
necessary
but
miss
barrett
was
resolved
against
which
might
divert
him
from
his
proper
vocation
as
a
poet
and
thanks
to
the
affection
of
an
uncle
she
had
means
some
a
year
capable
of
considerable
increase
by
of
the
principal
which
were
enough
for
two
persons
who
could
be
content
with
plain
living
in
italy
browning
still
urged
that
he
should
be
the
he
implored
that
her
money
should
be
made
over
to
her
own
family
so
that
no
prejudice
against
his
action
could
be
founded
on
any
mercenary
feeling
but
she
remained
firm
and
would
consent
only
to
its
transference
to
her
two
sisters
in
the
event
of
his
death
and
so
the
matter
rested
and
was
dismissed
from
the
thoughts
of
both
the
friends
having
the
great
patience
of
love
browning
would
not
put
the
least
pressure
upon
miss
barrett
as
to
the
date
of
their
marriage
if
waiting
long
was
for
her
good
then
he
would
wait
but
matters
seemed
tending
towards
the
desired
end
in
january
he
begged
her
to
begin
thinking
before
that
month
had
closed
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
look
forward
to
the
late
summer
or
early
autumn
as
the
time
of
their
departure
to
italy
not
until
march
would
miss
barrett
permit
browning
to
fetter
his
free
will
by
any
engagement
then
to
satisfy
his
urgent
desire
she
declared
that
she
was
willing
to
chain
him
rivet
him
do
you
feel
how
the
little
fine
chain
twists
round
and
round
you
do
you
hear
the
stroke
of
the
riveting
but
the
links
were
of
a
kind
to
be
loosed
if
need
be
at
a
moment
notice
june
came
and
with
it
a
proposal
from
a
friend
miss
bayley
to
accompany
her
to
italy
if
by
and
by
such
a
change
of
abode
seemed
likely
to
benefit
her
health
miss
barrett
was
prepared
to
accept
the
offer
if
it
seemed
right
to
browning
or
was
ready
if
he
thought
it
expedient
to
wait
for
another
year
his
voice
was
given
with
such
decision
as
was
possible
in
favour
of
their
adhering
to
the
plan
formed
for
the
end
of
summer
they
both
felt
the
present
position
hazardous
and
tormenting
to
wear
the
mask
for
another
year
would
suffocate
them
they
were
standing
on
hot
scythes
accordingly
during
the
summer
weeks
there
is
much
poring
over
to
italy
much
weighing
of
the
merits
of
this
place
of
residence
and
of
that
shall
it
be
sorrento
shall
it
be
la
cava
or
pisa
or
ravenna
or
for
the
matter
of
that
would
not
seven
dials
be
as
happy
a
choice
as
any
if
only
they
could
live
and
work
side
by
side
there
is
much
balancing
of
the
comparative
ease
and
the
comparative
cost
of
routes
the
final
decision
being
in
favour
of
reaching
italy
by
way
of
france
and
as
the
time
draws
nearer
there
is
much
searching
of
in
the
art
of
mastering
which
robert
browning
seems
hardly
to
have
been
an
expert
may
mr
kenyon
be
told
or
is
it
not
kinder
and
wiser
to
spare
him
the
responsibility
of
knowing
mrs
jameson
who
had
made
a
friendly
proposal
similar
to
that
of
miss
bayley
may
she
be
or
shall
she
be
invited
to
join
the
travellers
on
their
way
what
books
shall
be
brought
what
baggage
and
how
may
a
box
and
a
carpet
bag
be
conveyed
out
of
wimpole
street
with
least
observation
it
was
deeply
repugnant
to
miss
barrett
feelings
to
practise
reserve
on
such
a
matter
as
this
with
her
father
her
happier
companion
had
informed
his
father
and
mother
of
their
plans
and
had
obtained
from
the
elder
mr
browning
a
sum
of
money
asked
for
as
a
loan
rather
than
a
gift
sufficient
to
cover
the
immediate
expenses
of
the
journey
mr
barrett
was
entitled
to
all
respect
and
as
for
affection
he
received
from
his
daughter
enough
to
make
the
appearance
of
disloyalty
to
him
carry
a
real
pang
to
her
heart
but
she
believed
that
she
had
virtually
no
choice
her
nerves
were
not
of
iron
the
roaring
of
the
great
western
express
she
might
face
but
not
an
angry
father
a
loud
voice
and
a
violent
scene
such
as
she
had
witnessed
until
she
fainted
when
henrietta
was
the
culprit
would
have
put
an
end
to
the
italian
project
through
mere
physical
collapse
and
ruin
far
better
therefore
to
withdraw
quietly
from
the
house
and
trust
to
the
effect
of
a
subsequent
pleading
in
all
earnestness
for
reconciliation
illustration
yours
very
truly
robert
browning
an
engraving
armytage
as
summer
passed
into
early
autumn
the
sense
of
dangers
and
difficulties
accumulating
grew
acute
the
ground
wrote
browning
is
crumbling
from
beneath
our
feet
with
its
chances
and
opportunities
in
one
of
the
early
days
of
august
a
with
torrents
of
rain
detained
him
for
longer
than
usual
at
wimpole
street
the
lightning
was
the
lesser
terror
of
the
day
for
in
the
evening
entered
mr
barrett
to
his
daughter
with
disagreeable
questioning
and
presently
came
the
words
accompanied
by
a
gaze
of
stern
displeasure
it
appears
that
has
spent
the
whole
day
with
you
the
louring
cloud
passed
but
it
was
felt
that
visits
to
be
prudent
must
be
rare
for
the
first
time
a
week
went
by
without
a
meeting
early
in
september
george
barrett
a
kindly
brother
distinguished
by
his
constant
air
of
dignity
and
importance
was
commissioned
to
hire
a
country
house
for
the
family
at
dover
or
reigate
or
tunbridge
while
paperers
and
painters
were
to
busy
themselves
at
wimpole
street
the
moment
for
immediate
action
had
come
else
all
chance
of
italy
might
be
lost
for
the
year
we
must
be
married
directly
wrote
browning
on
the
morning
when
this
intelligence
arrived
next
day
a
marriage
license
was
procured
on
the
following
morning
saturday
september
accompanied
by
her
maid
wilson
miss
barrett
after
a
sleepless
night
left
her
father
house
with
feet
that
trembled
she
procured
a
fly
fortified
her
shaken
nerves
with
a
dose
of
sal
volatile
at
a
chemist
shop
and
drove
to
marylebone
church
where
the
marriage
service
was
celebrated
in
the
presence
of
two
witnesses
as
she
stood
and
knelt
her
central
feeling
was
one
of
measureless
trust
a
deep
rest
upon
assured
foundations
other
women
who
had
stood
there
supported
by
their
nearest
kinsfolk
parents
or
sisters
had
one
happiness
she
did
not
know
she
needed
it
less
because
she
was
happier
than
they
then
husband
and
wife
parted
mrs
browning
drove
to
the
house
of
her
blind
friend
mr
boyd
who
had
been
made
aware
of
the
engagement
on
his
sofa
she
rested
and
sipped
his
cyprus
wine
by
and
by
arrived
her
sisters
with
grave
faces
the
carriage
was
driven
to
hampstead
heath
for
the
soothing
happiness
of
the
autumnal
air
and
sunshine
after
which
the
three
sisters
returned
to
their
house
the
was
regretfully
taken
off
and
the
prayer
arose
in
mrs
browning
heart
that
if
sorrow
or
injury
should
ever
follow
upon
what
had
happened
that
day
for
either
of
the
two
it
might
all
fall
upon
her
browning
did
not
again
visit
at
wimpole
street
it
was
enough
to
know
that
his
wife
was
well
and
kept
all
these
things
gladly
tremblingly
in
her
heart
for
himself
he
felt
that
come
what
might
his
life
had
borne
flower
and
fruit
on
the
monday
week
which
succeeded
the
marriage
the
barrett
family
were
to
move
to
the
country
house
that
had
been
taken
at
little
bookham
on
saturday
afternoon
a
week
having
gone
by
since
the
wedding
mrs
browning
and
wilson
left
what
had
been
her
home
flush
was
warned
to
make
no
demonstration
and
he
behaved
with
admirable
discretion
it
was
dreadful
to
cause
pain
to
her
father
by
a
voluntary
act
but
another
feeling
sustained
her
you
as
if
one
said
and
we
shall
have
beside
i
pray
of
him
at
hodgson
the
stationer
and
bookseller
they
found
browning
and
a
little
later
husband
and
wife
with
the
brave
wilson
and
the
discreet
flush
were
speeding
from
vauxhall
to
southampton
in
good
time
to
catch
the
boat
for
havre
a
north
wind
blew
them
vehemently
from
the
english
coast
in
the
newspaper
announcements
of
the
wedding
the
date
was
to
be
omitted
and
browning
rejected
the
suggestion
that
on
this
occasion
and
with
reference
to
the
great
event
of
his
life
he
should
be
defined
to
the
public
as

early
years
in
italy
the
letters
from
which
this
story
has
been
drawn
have
from
first
to
last
one
burden
in
them
deep
answers
to
deep
they
happily
are
of
a
nature
to
escape
far
from
the
pedantries
of
literary
criticism
it
can
not
be
maintained
that
browning
quite
equals
his
correspondent
in
the
discovery
of
rare
and
exquisite
thoughts
and
feelings
or
that
his
felicity
in
giving
them
expression
is
as
frequent
as
hers
even
on
matters
of
literature
his
comments
are
less
original
than
hers
less
penetrating
less
illuminating
her
wit
is
the
swifter
and
keener
when
browning
writes
to
afford
her
amusement
he
sometimes
appears
to
us
who
are
not
greatly
amused
a
little
awkward
and
laborious
she
flashes
forth
a
metaphor
which
embodies
some
mystery
of
feeling
in
an
image
entirely
vital
he
with
a
habit
of
mind
of
which
he
was
conscious
and
which
often
influences
his
poetry
fastens
intensely
on
a
single
point
and
proceeds
to
muffle
this
in
circumstance
assured
that
it
will
be
all
the
more
vividly
apparent
when
the
right
instant
arrives
and
requires
this
but
meanwhile
some
is
demanded
from
the
reader
neither
correspondent
has
the
art
of
etching
a
person
or
a
scene
in
a
few
decisive
lines
the
gift
of
carlyle
the
gift
of
carlyle
brilliant
wife
is
not
theirs
perhaps
because
acid
is
needed
to
bite
an
plate
and
indeed
many
of
the
minor
notabilities
of
whose
names
appear
in
these
letters
might
hardly
have
repaid
an
etcher
intensity
of
selective
vision
among
the
groups
of
spirits
who
presented
themselves
to
dante
there
were
some
wise
enough
not
to
expect
that
their
names
should
be
remembered
on
earth
such
shades
may
stand
in
a
background
it
is
however
strange
that
browning
who
created
so
many
living
men
and
women
should
in
his
letters
have
struck
out
no
swift
indelible
piece
of
portraiture
even
here
his
is
the
inferior
touch
and
yet
throughout
the
whole
correspondence
we
can
not
but
be
aware
that
his
is
the
more
massive
and
the
more
complex
nature
his
intellect
has
hardier
thews
his
passion
has
an
energy
which
corresponds
with
its
mass
his
will
sustains
his
passion
and
projects
it
forward
and
towards
miss
barrett
his
strength
is
seen
as
gentleness
his
energy
as
an
inexhaustible
patience
of
hope
when
browning
and
his
wife
reached
paris
mrs
browning
was
worn
out
by
the
excitement
and
fatigue
by
a
happy
accident
mrs
jameson
and
her
niece
were
at
hand
and
when
the
first
surprise
with
kisses
to
both
fugitives
was
over
she
persuaded
them
to
rest
for
a
week
where
they
were
promising
if
they
consented
to
be
their
companion
and
aider
until
they
arrived
at
pisa
their
imprudence
in
her
eyes
was
the
height
of
prudence
wild
poets
or
not
they
were
wise
people
the
week
at
paris
was
given
up
to
quietude
once
they
visited
the
louvre
but
the
hours
passed
for
the
most
part
indoors
it
all
seemed
strange
and
visionary
whether
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
wrote
mrs
browning
i
can
not
tell
scarcely
from
paris
and
orleans
they
proceeded
southwards
in
weather
which
notwithstanding
some
rains
was
delightful
from
avignon
they
went
on
pilgrimage
to
petrarch
vaucluse
browning
bore
his
wife
to
a
rock
in
mid
stream
and
seated
her
there
while
flush
scurried
after
in
alarm
for
his
mistress
in
the
passage
from
marseilles
to
genoa
mrs
browning
was
able
to
sit
on
deck
the
change
of
air
although
gained
at
the
expense
of
some
weariness
had
done
her
a
world
of
good
early
in
october
the
journeying
closed
at
pisa
rooms
were
taken
for
six
months
in
the
great
collegio
ferdinando
close
to
the
duomo
and
the
leaning
tower
rooms
not
quite
the
warmest
in
aspect
mrs
jameson
pronounced
the
invalid
not
improved
but
transformed
the
repose
of
the
city
asleep
as
dickens
described
it
in
the
sun
and
the
secluded
life
a
perpetual
but
one
so
happy
suited
both
the
wedded
friends
days
of
cloudless
weather
following
a
spell
of
rain
went
by
in
reading
and
writing
and
talking
of
all
things
in
heaven
and
earth
and
a
little
besides
and
sometimes
even
laughing
as
if
we
had
twenty
people
to
laugh
with
us
or
rather
their
sole
acquaintance
was
an
italian
professor
of
the
university
for
three
months
they
never
looked
at
a
newspaper
then
a
loophole
on
the
world
was
opened
each
evening
by
the
arrival
of
the
si√®cle
the
lizards
were
silent
friends
of
one
poet
and
golden
oranges
gleamed
over
the
walls
to
the
unaccustomed
eyes
of
the
other
like
sunshine
gathered
into
globes
they
wandered
through
and
drove
until
the
purple
mountains
seemed
not
far
off
at
the
lanfranchi
palace
they
thought
of
byron
to
see
a
curl
of
whose
hair
or
a
glove
from
whose
hand
browning
declares
so
foolish
was
he
and
ignorant
he
would
have
gone
farther
than
to
see
all
wordsworth
coleridge
and
southey
condensed
in
rosicrucian
fashion
into
a
vial
in
the
campo
santo
they
listened
to
a
musical
mass
for
the
dead
in
the
duomo
they
heard
the
friar
preach
and
early
in
the
morning
their
dreams
were
scattered
by
the
harmonious
clangour
of
the
church
bells
i
never
was
happy
before
in
my
life
wrote
mrs
browning
her
husband
relieved
her
of
all
housekeeping
anxieties
at
two
came
a
light
dinner
perhaps
thrushes
and
chianti
from
the
at
six
appeared
coffee
and
at
nine
when
the
blazed
roast
chestnuts
and
grapes
debts
there
were
none
to
vex
the
spirits
of
these
prudent
children
of
genius
if
a
poet
could
not
pay
his
and
his
baker
bills
browning
sympathies
were
all
with
the
baker
and
the
butcher
he
would
not
sleep
wrote
his
wife
if
an
unpaid
bill
dragged
itself
by
any
chance
into
another
week
and
elsewhere
being
descended
from
the
blood
of
all
the
puritans
and
educated
by
the
strictest
of
dissenters
he
has
a
sort
of
horror
about
the
dreadful
fact
of
owing
five
shillings
five
days
perhaps
some
of
this
horror
arose
from
the
sense
of
that
weight
which
pecuniary
cares
hang
upon
all
the
more
joyous
mountings
of
the
mind
one
grief
and
only
one
was
still
present
mr
barrett
remained
inexorable
his
daughter
hoped
that
with
time
and
patience
his
arms
would
open
to
her
again
it
was
a
hope
never
to
be
fulfilled
in
the
cordial
comradeship
of
browning
sister
sarianna
a
new
correspondent
there
was
a
measure
of
compensation
already
browning
had
in
view
the
collected
edition
of
his
poetical
works
which
did
not
appear
until
the
poems
were
to
be
made
so
lucid
that
everyone
who
understood
them
hitherto
was
to
lose
that
mark
of
distinction
and
were
to
be
revised
with
special
care
the
sales
reported
by
moxon
were
considered
satisfactory
but
of
course
the
profits
as
yet
were
those
of
his
wife
poems
she
is
he
wrote
to
his
publisher
there
as
in
all
else
as
high
above
me
as
i
would
have
her
it
was
at
pisa
that
the
highest
evidence
of
his
wife
powers
as
a
poet
came
as
an
unexpected
and
wonderful
gift
to
her
husband
in
a
letter
of
december
more
than
a
year
since
she
had
confessed
that
she
was
idle
and
yet
silent
was
a
better
word
she
thought
than
idle
her
apology
was
that
the
apostle
paul
probably
did
not
work
hard
at
during
the
week
that
followed
his
hearing
of
the
unspeakable
things
at
the
close
of
a
letter
written
on
july
she
wrote
you
shall
see
some
day
at
pisa
what
i
will
not
show
you
now
does
not
solomon
say
that
is
a
time
to
read
what
is
written
if
he
does
he
ought
the
time
to
read
had
now
come
one
day
early
in
as
mr
gosse
records
what
was
told
to
him
by
browning
their
breakfast
being
over
mrs
browning
went
upstairs
while
her
husband
stood
at
the
window
watching
the
street
till
the
table
should
be
cleared
he
was
presently
aware
of
someone
behind
him
although
the
servant
was
gone
it
was
mrs
browning
who
held
him
by
the
shoulder
to
prevent
his
turning
to
look
at
her
and
at
the
same
time
pushed
a
packet
of
papers
into
the
pocket
of
his
coat
she
told
him
to
read
that
and
to
tear
it
up
if
he
did
not
like
it
and
then
she
fled
again
to
her
own
room
the
papers
were
a
transcript
of
those
ardent
poems
which
we
know
as
sonnets
from
the
portuguese
some
copies
were
printed
at
reading
in
for
private
circulation
with
the
title
sonnets
by
the
later
title
under
which
they
appeared
among
mrs
browning
poems
in
the
edition
of
was
of
browning
suggestion
his
wife
proposal
to
name
them
sonnets
from
the
bosnian
was
dismissed
with
words
which
allude
to
a
poem
of
hers
catarina
to
camoens
that
had
long
been
specially
dear
to
him
bosnian
no
that
means
nothing
from
the
portuguese
they
are
catarina
sonnets
pisa
with
all
its
charm
lacked
movement
and
animation
it
was
decided
to
visit
florence
in
april
and
there
enjoy
for
some
days
the
society
of
mrs
jameson
before
she
left
italy
the
coup√©
of
the
diligence
was
secured
and
on
april
mrs
jameson
wild
poets
but
wise
people
arrived
at
florence
an
excellent
apartment
was
found
in
the
via
delle
belle
donne
near
the
piazza
santa
maria
novella
and
for
special
delight
a
grand
piano
was
hired
when
mrs
browning
had
sufficiently
recovered
strength
to
view
the
city
and
its
surroundings
her
pleasure
was
great
at
pisa
we
say
beautiful
here
we
say
nothing
it
is
enough
if
we
can
breathe
they
had
hoped
for
summer
wanderings
in
northern
italy
but
florence
held
them
throughout
the
year
except
for
a
few
days
during
which
they
attempted
in
vain
to
find
a
shelter
from
the
heat
among
the
pines
of
vallombrosa
provided
with
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
the
abbot
they
set
forth
from
their
rooms
at
early
morning
by
vettura
and
from
pelago
onwards
while
browning
rode
mrs
browning
and
wilson
in
basket
sledges
were
slowly
drawn
towards
the
monastery
by
white
bullocks
a
new
abbot
a
little
holy
man
with
a
red
face
had
been
recently
installed
who
announced
that
in
his
nostrils
a
petticoat
stank
yet
in
the
charity
of
his
heart
he
extended
the
three
days
ordinarily
permitted
to
visitors
in
the
house
of
strangers
to
five
during
which
period
beef
and
oil
malodorous
bread
and
wine
and
passages
from
the
life
of
san
gualberto
were
vouchsafed
to
heretics
of
both
sexes
the
mountains
and
the
pinewoods
in
their
solemn
dialect
spoke
comfortable
words
rolling
or
sliding
down
the
precipitous
path
they
returned
to
florence
in
a
morning
glory
very
merry
says
mrs
browning
for
disappointed
people
shelter
from
the
glare
of
august
being
desirable
a
suite
of
comparatively
cool
rooms
in
the
palazzo
guidi
were
taken
they
were
furnished
in
good
taste
and
opened
upon
a
terrace
a
sort
of
balcony
terrace
which
swims
over
with
moonlight
in
the
evenings
from
casa
guidi
windows
and
before
long
mrs
browning
was
occupied
with
the
first
part
of
her
poem
something
of
the
life
of
italy
at
a
moment
of
peculiar
interest
could
be
observed
europe
in
the
years
and
was
like
a
sea
broken
by
wave
after
wave
of
revolutionary
passion
browning
and
his
wife
were
ardently
liberal
in
their
political
feeling
but
there
were
differences
in
the
colours
of
their
respective
creeds
and
sentiments
mrs
browning
gave
away
her
imagination
to
popular
movements
she
was
also
naturally
a
she
hoped
more
enthusiastically
than
he
was
wont
to
do
she
was
more
readily
depressed
the
word
liberty
for
her
had
an
aureole
or
a
nimbus
which
glorified
all
its
humbler
and
more
prosaic
meanings
browning
although
in
this
year
he
made
a
move
towards
an
appointment
as
secretary
to
a
mission
to
the
vatican
at
heart
cared
little
for
men
in
groups
or
societies
he
cared
greatly
for
individuals
for
the
growth
of
individual
character
he
had
faith
in
a
forward
movement
of
society
but
the
law
of
social
evolution
as
he
conceived
it
is
not
in
the
hands
of
political
leaders
or
ministers
of
state
he
valued
liberty
chiefly
because
each
man
here
on
earth
is
in
process
of
being
tested
in
process
of
being
formed
and
liberty
is
the
condition
of
a
man
true
probation
and
development
late
in
life
he
was
asked
to
give
his
answer
to
the
question
why
am
i
a
liberal
and
he
gave
it
succinctly
in
a
sonnet
which
he
did
not
reprint
in
any
edition
of
his
works
although
it
received
otherwise
a
wide
circulation
it
may
be
cited
here
as
a
fragment
of
biography
why
because
all
i
haply
can
and
do
all
that
i
am
now
all
i
hope
to
be
whence
comes
it
save
from
fortune
setting
free
body
and
soul
the
purpose
to
pursue
god
traced
for
both
if
fetters
not
a
few
of
prejudice
convention
fall
from
me
these
shall
i
bid
men
each
in
his
degree
also
bear
and
gladly
too
but
little
do
or
can
the
best
of
us
that
little
is
achieved
through
liberty
who
then
dares
hold
emancipated
thus
his
fellow
shall
continue
bound
not
i
who
live
love
labour
freely
nor
discuss
a
brother
right
to
freedom
that
is
why
this
is
an
excellent
reason
for
the
faith
that
was
in
browning
he
holds
that
individual
progress
depends
on
individual
freedom
and
by
that
word
he
understands
not
only
political
freedom
but
also
emancipation
from
intellectual
narrowness
and
the
bondage
of
injurious
convention
but
browning
in
his
verse
setting
aside
the
early
nowhere
celebrates
a
popular
political
movement
he
nowhere
chaunts
a
paean
in
the
manner
of
byron
or
shelley
in
honour
of
the
abstraction
liberty
nor
does
he
anywhere
study
political
phenomena
or
events
except
as
they
throw
light
upon
an
individual
character
things
and
persons
that
gave
him
offence
he
could
summarily
dismiss
from
his
mind
thiers
is
a
rascal
i
make
a
point
of
not
reading
one
word
said
by
thiers
proudhon
is
a
madman
who
cares
for
proudhon
the
president
an
ass
is
not
worth
thinking
of
this
may
be
admirable
economy
of
intellectual
force
but
it
is
not
the
way
to
understand
the
course
of
public
events
it
does
not
indicate
a
political
or
a
historical
sense
and
indeed
his
writings
do
not
show
that
browning
possessed
a
political
or
a
historical
sense
in
any
high
degree
save
as
a
representative
person
may
be
conceived
by
him
as
embodying
a
phase
of
civilisation
when
mrs
trollope
called
at
casa
guidi
browning
was
only
reluctantly
present
she
had
written
against
liberal
institutions
and
against
the
poetry
of
victor
hugo
and
that
was
enough
might
it
not
have
been
more
truly
liberal
to
be
patient
and
understand
the
grounds
of
her
prejudice
blessed
be
the
inconsistency
of
men
exclaimed
mrs
browning
for
whose
sake
he
tolerated
the
offending
authoress
until
by
and
by
he
came
to
like
in
her
an
agreeable
woman
on
the
anniversary
of
their
wedding
day
browning
and
his
wife
saw
from
their
window
a
brilliant
procession
of
grateful
and
enthusiastic
florentines
stream
into
the
pitti
with
banners
and
for
the
space
of
three
hours
and
a
half
it
was
the
time
when
the
grand
duke
was
a
patriot
and
pio
nono
was
a
liberal
the
new
helmets
and
epaulettes
of
the
civic
guard
proclaimed
the
glories
of
genuine
freedom
the
pleasure
of
the
populace
was
like
that
of
children
and
perhaps
it
had
some
serious
feeling
behind
it
the
incomparable
grand
duke
had
granted
a
liberal
constitution
and
was
led
back
from
the
opera
to
the
pitti
by
the
torchlights
of
a
cheering
crowd
through
the
dark
night
a
flock
of
stars
seemed
sweeping
up
the
piazza
a
few
months
later
and
the
word
of
mrs
browning
is
ah
poor
italy
the
people
are
attractive
delightful
but
they
want
conscience
and
self
reverence
browning
and
she
painfully
felt
that
they
grew
cooler
and
cooler
on
the
subject
of
italian
patriotism
a
revolution
had
been
promised
but
a
shower
of
rain
fell
and
the
revolution
was
postponed
now
it
was
the
grand
duke
and
the
bells
rang
and
a
tree
of
liberty
was
planted
close
to
the
door
of
casa
guidi
six
weeks
later
it
was
the
grand
duke
and
the
same
bells
rang
and
the
tree
of
liberty
was
pulled
down
the
pope
is
but
weak
and
before
long
honorific
epithets
have
to
be
denied
him
he
is
merely
a
pope
his
prestige
and
power
over
souls
is
lost
the
liberal
grand
duke
is
transformed
into
a
duke
decorated
with
austrian
titles
as
for
france
mrs
browning
had
long
since
learnt
from
the
books
she
read
with
so
much
delight
to
feel
a
debt
to
the
country
of
balzac
and
george
sand
she
thought
that
the
unrest
and
the
eager
hopes
of
the
french
revolution
notwithstanding
its
errors
indicated
at
least
the
conception
of
a
higher
ideal
than
any
known
to
the
english
people
browning
did
not
possess
an
equal
confidence
in
france
he
did
not
accept
her
view
that
the
french
occupation
of
rome
was
capable
of
justification
nor
did
he
enter
into
her
growing
as
yet
far
from
its
full
development
of
louis
napoleon
her
admiration
for
balzac
he
shared
and
it
is
probable
that
the
death
of
the
great
novelist
moved
him
to
keener
regret
than
did
the
death
at
no
considerable
distance
of
time
of
wordsworth
with
french
communism
or
socialism
neither
husband
nor
wife
however
republican
in
their
faith
had
sympathy
they
held
that
its
tendency
is
to
diminish
the
influence
of
the
individual
and
that
in
the
end
the
progress
of
the
mass
is
dependent
on
the
starting
forth
from
the
mass
and
the
striding
forward
of
individual
minds
they
believed
as
firmly
as
did
edmund
burke
in
the
importance
of
what
burke
styles
a
natural
aristocracy
for
four
years
from
to
browning
never
crossed
the
confines
of
italy
no
duties
summoned
him
away
and
he
was
happy
in
his
home
we
are
as
happy
he
wrote
in
december
as
two
owls
in
a
hole
two
toads
under
a
or
any
other
queer
two
poking
creatures
that
we
let
live
after
the
fashion
of
their
black
hearts
only
ba
is
fat
and
rosy
yes
indeed
in
spring
they
drove
day
by
day
through
the
cascine
passing
on
the
way
the
carven
window
of
the
and
the
and
the
stone
called
dante
whereupon
he
used
to
bring
his
quiet
chair
out
turned
to
brunelleschi
church
and
after
tea
there
was
the
bridge
of
trinita
from
which
to
watch
the
sunsets
turning
the
arno
to
pure
gold
while
the
moon
and
the
hung
aloft
it
was
a
life
of
retirement
and
of
quiet
work
mrs
browning
mentions
to
a
friend
that
for
fifteen
months
she
could
not
make
her
husband
spend
a
single
evening
out
not
even
to
a
concert
nor
to
hear
a
play
of
alfieri
but
what
with
music
and
books
and
writing
and
talking
she
adds
we
scarcely
know
how
the
days
go
it
such
a
gallop
on
the
grass
the
writing
included
the
revision
and
preparation
for
the
press
of
browning
in
two
volumes
which
chapman
hall
more
liberal
than
moxon
had
undertaken
to
publish
at
their
own
risk
and
which
appeared
in
some
care
and
thought
were
also
given
by
browning
to
the
alterations
of
text
made
in
the
edition
of
his
wife
poems
of
the
following
year
and
for
a
time
his
own
eve
and
easter
was
an
absorbing
occupation
as
to
the
reading
the
chief
disadvantage
of
florence
towards
the
middle
of
the
last
century
was
the
difficulty
of
seeing
new
books
of
interest
whether
french
or
english
yet
and
princess
jane
and
somehow
found
their
way
to
casa
guidi
casa
guidi
proper
the
casa
guidi
which
held
the
books
and
pictures
and
furniture
and
graceful
chosen
by
its
occupants
who
were
lovers
of
beauty
dates
only
from
previously
they
had
been
satisfied
with
a
furnished
apartment
not
long
before
the
unfurnished
rooms
were
hired
a
mistake
in
choosing
rooms
which
suffered
from
the
absence
of
sunshine
and
warmth
gave
browning
an
opportunity
of
displaying
what
to
his
wife
eyes
appeared
to
be
unexampled
magnanimity
the
six
months
rent
was
promptly
paid
and
chambers
on
the
pitti
yellow
with
sunshine
from
morning
to
evening
were
secured
any
other
man
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
his
wife
assured
miss
mitford
would
have
stamped
and
sworn
a
little
for
the
mere
relief
of
the
thing
but
as
to
being
angry
with
for
any
cause
except
not
eating
enough
dinner
the
sun
would
turn
the
wrong
way
first
it
seemed
an
excellent
piece
of
economy
to
take
the
spacious
suite
of
unfurnished
rooms
in
the
via
maggio
now
distinguished
by
the
inscription
known
to
all
visitors
to
florence
which
were
to
be
had
for
guineas
a
year
and
which
when
furnished
might
be
let
during
any
prolonged
absence
for
a
considerable
sum
the
temptation
of
a
in
the
frescobaldi
palace
and
a
garden
bright
with
camellias
to
which
browning
for
a
time
inclined
was
rejected
at
casa
guidi
the
double
terrace
where
and
camellias
also
might
find
a
place
made
amends
for
the
garden
with
its
threatening
cloud
of
mosquitoes
worse
than
austrians
every
need
of
space
and
height
of
warmth
and
coolness
seemed
to
be
met
and
it
only
remained
to
expend
the
welcome
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
books
in
the
recreation
of
gathering
together
rococo
chairs
spring
sofas
carved
bookcases
satin
from
cardinals
beds
and
the
rest
before
long
browning
amused
himself
in
picking
up
for
a
few
pauls
this
or
that
picture
on
seeing
which
an
accomplished
connoisseur
like
kirkup
would
even
hazard
the
name
of
cimabue
or
ghirlandaio
or
if
not
that
of
giotto
then
the
safer
adjective
giottesque
although
living
the
life
of
retirement
which
his
wife
uncertain
state
of
health
required
browning
gradually
obtained
the
acquaintance
of
several
interesting
persons
of
whom
kirkup
who
has
just
been
mentioned
was
one
as
to
italian
society
wrote
mrs
browning
one
may
as
well
take
to
longing
for
the
evening
star
for
it
seems
quite
inaccessible
but
the
name
of
elizabeth
barrett
if
not
yet
that
of
robert
browning
was
a
sufficient
introduction
to
cultivated
englishmen
and
americans
who
had
made
florence
their
home
among
the
earliest
of
these
acquaintances
were
the
american
sculptor
powers
swedenborgian
and
spiritualist
a
simple
and
genial
man
with
eyes
like
a
wild
indian
so
black
and
full
of
light
and
hillard
the
american
lawyer
who
in
his
months
in
described
browning
conversation
as
like
the
poetry
of
chaucer
meaning
perhaps
that
it
was
hearty
fresh
and
vigorous
or
like
his
own
poetry
simplified
and
made
transparent
it
seems
impossible
hillard
goes
on
to
think
that
he
can
ever
grow
old
and
of
mrs
browning
i
have
never
seen
a
human
frame
which
seemed
so
nearly
a
transparent
veil
for
a
celestial
and
immortal
spirit
she
is
a
soul
of
fire
enclosed
in
a
shell
of
pearl
a
third
american
friend
was
one
who
could
bring
tidings
of
emerson
and
hawthorne
margaret
fuller
of
the
dial
now
countess
far
better
than
her
writings
says
mrs
browning
not
only
exalted
but
in
her
opinions
yet
calm
in
manner
her
loss
with
that
of
her
husband
on
their
voyage
to
america
deeply
affected
mrs
browning
was
she
happy
in
anything
asks
her
sorrowing
friend
the
first
person
seen
on
italian
soil
when
browning
and
his
wife
disembarked
at
leghorn
was
the
brilliant
and
erratic
irish
priest
father
prout
of
who
befriended
them
with
good
spirits
and
a
potion
of
eggs
and
port
wine
when
browning
was
ill
in
florence
and
chided
mrs
browning
as
a
bambina
for
her
needless
fears
charles
lever
with
the
sunniest
of
faces
and
cordialest
of
manners
animal
spirits
preponderating
a
little
too
much
over
an
energetic
intellect
called
on
them
at
the
baths
of
lucca
but
the
acquaintance
did
not
ripen
into
friendship
and
little
miss
boyle
one
of
the
family
of
the
earls
of
cork
would
come
at
night
at
the
hour
of
chestnuts
and
mulled
wine
to
sparkle
as
vivaciously
as
the
that
warmed
her
feet
these
with
the
hoppners
known
to
shelley
and
byron
a
french
sculptress
of
royalist
sympathies
mlle
de
fauveau
much
admired
by
browning
and
one
of
the
grandsons
of
goethe
who
flits
into
and
out
of
the
scene
were
a
compensation
for
the
repulsiveness
of
certain
english
folk
at
florence
who
gathered
together
only
for
the
frivolities
and
worse
than
frivolities
of
foreign
wayfaring
in
march
joy
and
sorrow
met
and
mingled
in
the
lives
of
browning
and
his
wife
on
the
ninth
of
that
month
a
son
was
born
at
casa
guidi
who
six
weeks
later
was
described
by
his
mother
as
a
lovely
fat
strong
child
with
double
chin
and
rosy
cheeks
and
a
great
wide
chest
he
was
baptised
with
the
simple
lutheran
rites
robert
wiedemann
barrett
the
wiedemann
in
remembrance
of
the
maiden
name
of
mother
from
the
first
browning
and
his
wife
to
adopt
a
phrase
from
one
of
her
letters
caught
up
their
parental
pleasures
with
a
sort
of
passion
mrs
browning
letters
croon
with
happiness
in
the
beauty
the
strength
the
intelligence
the
disposition
of
her
boy
and
the
boy
father
from
the
days
when
he
would
walk
up
and
down
the
terrace
of
casa
guidi
with
the
infant
in
his
arms
to
the
last
days
of
his
life
felt
to
the
full
the
gladness
and
the
repose
that
came
with
this
strong
bondage
of
his
heart
when
little
wiedemann
could
frame
imperfect
speech
upon
his
lips
he
transformed
that
name
into
penini
which
abbreviated
to
pen
became
serviceable
for
domesticities
it
was
a
fantastic
derivation
of
nathaniel
hawthorne
which
connected
penini
with
the
colossal
statue
in
florence
bearing
the
name
of
apeninno
flush
for
a
time
grew
jealous
and
not
altogether
without
cause
but
the
joy
was
pursued
and
overtaken
by
sorrow
a
few
days
after
the
birth
of
his
son
came
tidings
of
the
death
of
browning
mother
he
had
loved
her
with
a
rare
degree
of
passion
the
sudden
reaction
from
the
happiness
of
his
wife
safety
and
his
son
birth
was
terrible
it
almost
seemed
a
wrong
to
his
grief
to
admit
into
his
consciousness
the
new
gladness
of
the
time
in
this
conflict
of
emotions
his
spirits
and
to
some
extent
his
health
gave
way
he
could
not
think
of
returning
to
his
father
home
without
extreme
pain
it
would
break
his
heart
he
said
to
see
his
mother
roses
over
the
wall
and
the
place
where
she
used
to
lay
her
scissors
and
gloves
he
longed
that
his
father
and
sister
should
quit
the
home
of
sorrow
and
hasten
to
florence
but
this
was
not
to
be
as
for
england
it
could
not
be
thought
of
as
much
on
his
wife
account
as
his
own
her
father
held
no
communication
with
her
supplicating
letters
remained
unnoticed
her
brothers
were
temporarily
estranged
her
sister
henrietta
had
left
her
former
home
having
insulted
her
father
by
asking
his
consent
to
her
marriage
with
captain
surtees
cook
she
had
taken
the
matter
into
her
own
hands
the
deed
was
done
and
the
name
of
his
second
undutiful
daughter
married
to
a
person
of
moderate
means
and
odiously
tractarian
views
was
never
again
to
be
mentioned
in
mr
barrett
presence
england
had
become
for
mrs
browning
a
place
of
painful
memories
and
a
centre
of
present
strife
which
she
did
not
feel
herself
as
yet
able
to
encounter
the
love
of
wandering
however
when
successive
summers
came
and
florence
was
ablaze
with
sunshine
grew
irresistible
and
drove
browning
and
his
household
to
seek
elsewhere
for
fresh
interests
or
for
coolness
and
repose
in
beguiled
by
the
they
visited
fano
to
find
it
quivering
with
heat
the
very
air
swooning
in
the
sun
their
reward
at
fano
was
that
picture
by
guercino
of
the
guardian
angel
teaching
a
child
to
pray
the
thought
of
which
browning
has
translated
into
song
we
were
at
fano
and
three
times
we
went
to
sit
and
see
him
in
his
chapel

and
drink
his
beauty
to
our
soul
content

angel

passed
through
olive
woods
and
vineyards
and
rested
in
a
sort
of
eagle
nest
at
the
highest
habitable
point
of
the
baths
of
lucca
here
the
baby
great
cheeks
grew
rosier
browning
gained
in
spirits
and
his
wife
was
able
to
climb
the
hills
and
help
him
to
lose
himself
in
the
forests
when
they
wandered
at
noon
except
for
some
peasant
or
some
monk
with
the
rope
around
his
waist
it
was
complete
solitude
and
on
moonlit
nights
they
sat
by
the
waterfalls
in
an
atmosphere
that
had
the
lightness
of
mountain
air
without
its
keenness
on
one
occasion
they
climbed
by
dry
torrent
courses
five
miles
into
the
mountains
baby
and
all
on
horseback
and
donkeyback
such
a
congregation
of
mountains
looking
alive
in
the
stormy
light
we
saw
them
by
it
was
certainly
a
blessed
transformation
of
the
prostrate
invalid
in
the
upper
room
at
wimpole
street
setting
aside
his
own
happiness
browning
could
feel
with
regard
to
her
and
his
deep
desire
to
serve
her
that
he
had
seen
of
the
travail
of
his
soul
and
in
this
matter
was
satisfied
the
weeks
at
siena
of
the
year
were
not
quite
so
prosperous
during
that
summer
mrs
browning
had
been
seriously
ill
when
sufficiently
recovered
she
was
carried
by
her
husband
to
a
villa
in
the
midst
of
vines
and
olives
a
mile
and
a
half
or
two
miles
outside
siena
which
commanded
a
noble
prospect
of
hills
and
plain
at
first
she
could
only
remain
seated
in
the
which
he
found
for
her
in
the
city
for
a
day
there
was
much
alarm
on
behalf
of
the
boy
now
able
to
run
about
who
lay
with
heavy
head
and
glassy
eyes
in
a
but
presently
he
was
astir
again
and
his
singing
voice
was
heard
in
the
house
and
garden
mrs
browning
in
the
fresh
yet
warm
september
air
regained
her
strength
before
returning
to
florence
they
spent
a
week
in
the
city
to
see
the
churches
and
the
pictures
by
sodoma
even
little
wiedemann
screamed
for
and
developed
remarkable
imitative
pietisms
of
a
theatrical
kind
it
was
as
well
said
browning
to
have
the
eyeteeth
and
the
puseyistical
crisis
over
together
this
comment
although
no
more
than
a
passing
word
spoken
in
play
gives
a
correct
indication
of
browning
feeling
fully
shared
in
by
his
wife
towards
the
religious
movement
in
england
which
was
altering
the
face
of
the
established
church
puseyism
was
for
them
a
kind
of
child
play
which
unfortunately
had
religion
for
its
they
viewed
it
with
a
superior
smile
in
which
there
was
more
of
pity
than
of
anger
both
of
them
though
one
was
a
writer
for
the
stage
and
the
other
could
read
without
flinching
and
approved
the
morals
of
dame
aux
had
their
roots
in
english
puritanism
and
now
the
time
had
come
when
browning
was
to
embody
some
of
his
puritan
thoughts
and
feelings
relating
to
religion
in
a
highly
original
poem

within

two

with

the

was

and
subsequently
the

became
like

as
early
as
in
the
opening
days
of
the
correspondence
with
miss
barrett
when
she
had
called
upon
her
friend
to
speak
as
poet
in
his
own
person
and
to
speak
out
he
assured
her
that
whereas
hitherto
he
had
only
made
men
and
women
utter
themselves
on
his
behalf
and
had
given
the
truth
not
as
pure
white
light
but
broken
into
prismatic
hues
now
he
would
try
to
declare
directly
that
which
was
in
him
in
place
of
his
men
and
women
he
would
have
her
to
be
a
companion
in
his
work
and
yet
he
adds
i
do
think
i
shall
let
hear
after
all
the
savage
things
about
popes
and
imaginative
religions
that
i
must
say
we
can
only
conjecture
as
to
whether
the
theme
of
the
poem
of
was
already
in
browning
mind
his
wife
influence
certainly
was
not
unlikely
to
incline
him
towards
the
choice
of
a
subject
which
had
some
immediate
relation
to
contemporary
thought
she
knew
that
poetry
to
be
of
permanent
value
must
do
more
than
reflect
a
passing
fashion
that
in
a
certain
sense
it
must
in
its
essence
be
out
of
time
and
space
expressing
ideas
and
passions
which
are
parts
of
our
abiding
humanity
yet
she
recognised
an
advantage
in
pressing
into
what
is
permanent
through
the
forms
which
it
assumes
in
the
world
immediately
around
the
artist
and
even
in
the
design
of
such
a
poem
as
her
own
was
occupying
her
thoughts
she
speaks
of
her
intention
of
writing
a
sort
of
running
into
the
midst
of
our
conventions
and
rushing
into
and
the
like
angels
fear
to
tread
and
so
meeting
face
to
face
and
without
mask
the
humanity
of
the
age
and
speaking
the
truth
as
i
conceive
of
it
out
plainly
browning
poem
did
not
rush
into
but
it
stepped
boldly
into
churches
and
conventicles
and
the
of
theological
professors
the
spiritual
life
individual
and
the
spiritual
life
corporate
these
to
state
it
in
a
word
are
the
subjects
dealt
with
in
the
two
connected
poems
of
his
new
volume
the
spiritual
life
individual
is
considered
in
the
spiritual
life
corporate
in
browning
with
the
blood
of
all
the
puritans
in
him
as
his
wife
expressed
it
could
not
undervalue
that
strain
of
piety
which
had
descended
from
the
exiles
at
geneva
and
had
run
on
through
the
struggles
for
religious
liberty
in
the
nonconformist
religious
societies
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
the
evangelical
revival
of
times
less
remote
looking
around
him
he
had
seen
in
his
own
day
the
progress
of
two
remarkable
movements
one
embodying
or
professing
to
embody
the
catholic
as
opposed
to
the
puritan
conception
of
religion
the
other
a
free
critical
movement
tending
to
the
disintegration
of
the
traditional
dogma
of
christianity
yet
seeking
to
preserve
and
maintain
its
ethical
and
even
in
part
its
religious
influence
the
facts
can
be
put
concisely
if
we
say
that
one
and
the
same
epoch
produced
in
england
the
sermons
of
spurgeon
the
pro
vita
of
newman
and
the
and
of
matthew
arnold
to
discuss
these
three
conceptions
of
religion
adequately
in
verse
would
have
been
impossible
even
for
the
argumentative
genius
of
dryden
and
would
have
converted
a
work
of
art
into
a
theological
treatise
but
three
representative
scenes
might
be
painted
and
some
truths
of
passionate
feeling
might
be
flung
out
by
way
of
commentary
such
was
the
design
of
the
poet
of
to
topple
over
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
is
not
difficult
but
the
presence
of
humour
might
save
the
sublimities
from
a
fall
and
browning
had
hitherto
in
his
art
made
but
slight
and
occasional
use
of
a
considerable
gift
of
humour
which
he
possessed
it
was
humour
not
of
the
highest
or
finest
or
subtlest
kind
it
was
very
far
from
the
humour
of
shakespeare
or
of
cervantes
which
felt
so
profoundly
all
the
incongruities
majestic
pathetic
and
laughable
of
human
nature
but
it
had
a
rough
vigour
of
its
own
it
was
united
with
a
capacity
for
exact
and
shrewd
observation
and
if
it
should
ever
lead
him
to
play
the
part
of
a
satirist
the
satire
must
needs
be
rather
that
of
love
than
of
malice
one
who
esteemed
so
highly
the
work
of
balzac
and
of
flaubert
might
well
be
surmised
to
have
something
in
his
composition
of
what
we
now
call
the
realist
in
art
and
the
work
of
the
realist
might
serve
to
sustain
and
vindicate
the
idealist
ventures
of
imaginative
faith
the
picture
of
the
entry
of
mount
zion
and
of
the
pious
sheep
duly
indignant
at
the
interloper
in
their
midst
who
one
by
one
enter
the
fold
if
not
worthy
of
cervantes
or
of
shakespeare
is
hardly
inferior
to
the
descriptive
passages
of
dickens
and
it
is
touched
in
the
manner
of
dickens
with
pity
for
these
rags
and
tatters
of
humanity
the
night
the
black
barricade
of
cloud
the
sudden
apparition
of
the
moon
the
vast
double
rainbow
and
he
whose
sweepy
garment
eddies
onward
become
at
once
more
supernatural
and
more
unquestionably
real
because
sublimity
springs
out
of
grotesquerie
is
the
vision
of
the
face
of
christ
an
illusion
the
whole
face
turned
upon
me
full
and
i
spread
myself
beneath
it
as
when
the
bleacher
spreads
to
seethe
it
in
the
cleansing
sun
his
wool
steeps
in
the
flood
of
noontide
whiteness
some
defiled
discoloured
web
so
lay
i
saturate
with
brightness
is
this
a
phantom
or
a
dream
well
at
least
it
is
certain
that
the
witness
has
seen
with
his
mortal
eyes
the
fat
weary
woman
and
heard
the
mighty
report
of
her
umbrella
wry
and
flapping
a
wreck
of
whalebones
and
the
fat
woman
of
mount
zion
chapel
with
love
lane
at
the
back
of
it
may
help
us
to
credit
the
awful
vision
of
the
lord
thus
the
poem
has
the
imaginative
sensuousness
which
art
demands
it
is
not
an
argument
but
a
series
of
vivid
experiences
though
what
is
sensuous
is
here
tasked
in
the
service
of
what
is
spiritual
and
a
commentary
is
added
the
central
idea
of
the
whole
is
that
where
love
is
there
is
christ
and
the
christ
of
this
poem
is
certainly
no
abstraction
no
moral
ideal
no
transcendental
conception
of
absolute
charity
but
very
god
and
very
man
the
christ
of
nazareth
who
dwelt
among
men
full
of
grace
and
truth
literary
criticism
which
would
interpret
browning
meaning
in
any
other
sense
may
be
ingenious
but
it
is
not
disinterested
and
some
blows
it
far
from
the
mark
love
with
defective
knowledge
he
maintains
is
of
more
spiritual
worth
than
knowledge
with
defective
love
desiring
to
give
salience
to
this
idea
he
deprives
his
little
pious
conventicle
of
every
virtue
except
one
love
and
no
other
word
is
written
on
each
forehead
of
the
worshippers
browning
the
artist
and
student
of
art
was
not
insensible
to
the
spiritual
power
of
beauty
and
beauty
is
conspicuously
absent
from
the
praise
and
prayer
that
went
up
from
mount
zion
chapel
its
forms
of
worship
are
burlesque
and
uncouth
browning
the
lover
of
knowledge
was
not
insensible
to
the
value
of
intelligence
in
things
of
religion
and
the
congregation
of
mount
zion
sit
on
divinely
flustered
under
the
pressure
of
the
preaching
man
immense
stupidity
the
pastor
whose
words
so
sway
his
enraptured
flock
mangles
the
holy
scriptures
with
a
fine
irreverence
and
pours
forth
his
doctrine
with
an
entirely
indifference
to
reason
and
common
sense
nor
has
love
accomplished
its
perfect
work
for
the
interloper
who
stands
at
the
entry
is
eyed
with
inquisitorial
glances
of
pious
exclusiveness
how
has
a
gallio
such
as
he
ventured
to
take
his
station
among
the
elect
matthew
arnold
had
he
visited
mount
zion
might
have
discoursed
with
a
charmingly
insolent
urbanity
on
the
genius
for
ugliness
in
english
dissent
and
the
supreme
need
of
bringing
a
current
of
new
ideas
to
play
upon
the
unintelligent
use
of
its
traditional
formulae
and
matthew
arnold
would
have
been
right
these
are
the
precise
subjects
of
browning
somewhat
satire
but
browning
adds
that
in
mount
zion
love
at
least
in
its
rudiments
is
present
and
where
love
is
there
is
christ
of
english
nonconformity
in
its
humblest
forms
browning
can
write
as
it
were
from
within
he
writes
of
roman
catholic
forms
of
worship
as
one
who
stands
outside
his
sympathy
with
the
prostrate
multitude
in
peter
at
rome
is
of
an
impersonal
kind
founded
rather
upon
the
recognition
of
an
objective
fact
than
springing
from
an
instinctive
feeling
for
a
moment
he
is
carried
away
by
the
tide
of
their
devout
enthusiasms
but
he
recovers
himself
to
find
indeed
that
love
is
also
here
and
therefore
christ
is
present
but
the
worshippers
fallen
under
rome
gross
yoke
are
very
infants
in
their
need
of
these
sacred
buffooneries
and
posturings
and
petticoatings
infants
peevish
as
ever
to
be
suckled
lulled
with
the
same
old
with
intermixture
of
the
rattle
and
this
though
the
time
has
come
when
love
would
have
them
no
longer
infantile
but
capable
of
standing
and
walking
not
to
speak
of
trying
to
climb
such
a
short
and
easy
method
of
dealing
with
roman
catholic
dogma
and
ritual
can
not
be
commended
for
its
intelligence
it
is
quite
possible
to
be
on
the
same
side
as
browning
without
being
as
crude
as
he
in
misconception
he
does
not
seriously
consider
the
catholic
idea
which
regards
things
of
sense
as
made
luminous
by
the
spirit
of
which
they
are
the
envoys
and
the
ministers
it
is
enough
for
him
to
declare
his
own
creed
which
treats
any
intermediary
between
the
human
soul
and
the
divine
as
an
obstruction
or
a
veil
my
heart
does
best
to
receive
in
meekness
that
mode
of
worship
as
most
to
his
mind
where
earthly
aids
being
left
behind
his
all
in
all
appears
serene
with
the
thinnest
human
veil
between
letting
the
mystic
lamps
the
seven
the
many
motions
of
his
spirit
pass
as
they
list
to
earth
from
heaven
this
was
the
creed
of
milton
and
of
bunyan
and
yet
with
both
milton
and
bunyan
the
imagery
of
the
senses
is
employed
as
the
means
not
of
concealing
but
revealing
the
things
of
the
spirit
from
the
of
g√∂ttingen
with
its
destructive
and
reconstructive
criticism
browning
is
even
farther
removed
than
he
is
from
the
ritualisms
of
the
roman
basilica
yet
no
caricature
can
be
more
amiable
than
his
drawing
of
the
learned
professor
so
gentle
in
his
aspect
so
formidable
in
his
conclusions
who
gazing
into
the
air
with
a
pure
abstracted
look
proceeds
in
a
grave
sweet
voice
to
exhibit
and
analyse
the
sources
of
the
myth
of
christ
in
the
browning
finds
intellect
indeed
but
only
the
shadow
of
love
he
argues
that
if
the
myth
of
christ
be
dissolved
the
authority
of
christ
as
a
teacher
disappears
christ
is
even
inferior
to
other
moralists
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
made
personal
claims
which
can
not
be
sustained
and
whatever
may
be
christ
merit
as
a
teacher
of
the
truth
the
motive
to
action
which
his
life
and
words
supplied
must
cease
to
exist
if
it
be
shown
that
the
divine
sacrifice
of
god
manifest
in
the
flesh
is
no
more
than
a
figment
of
the
devout
imagination
at
every
point
the
criticism
of
browning
is
as
far
apart
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
from
the
criticism
set
forth
in
the
later
writings
of
matthew
arnold
the
one
writer
regards
the
myth
as
no
more
than
the
of
a
risen
christ
whose
essential
virtue
lies
in
his
sweet
reasonableness
and
his
morality
touched
with
enthusiasm
the
other
believes
that
if
the
wonderful
story
of
love
be
proved
a
fable
a
profound
alteration
and
an
alteration
for
the
worse
has
been
made
in
the
religious
consciousness
of
christendom
and
undoubtedly
the
difference
between
the
supernatural
and
the
natural
theories
of
christianity
is
far
greater
than
arnold
represented
it
to
be
but
browning
at
this
date
very
inadequately
conceived
the
power
of
christ
as
a
revealer
of
the
fatherhood
of
god
in
that
revelation
whether
the
son
of
god
was
human
or
divine
lay
a
truth
of
surpassing
power
and
a
motive
of
action
capable
of
summoning
forth
the
purest
and
highest
energies
of
the
soul
that
such
is
the
case
has
been
abundantly
evidenced
by
the
facts
of
history
browning
finds
only
much
learning
and
the
ghost
of
dead
love
in
the
g√∂ttingen
and
of
course
it
was
easy
to
adapt
his
professor
lecture
so
as
to
arrive
at
this
conclusion
but
the
process
and
the
conclusion
are
alike
unjust
having
traversed
the
various
forms
of
christian
faith
and
scepticism
the
speaker
in
declines
into
a
mood
of
lazy
benevolence
and
mild
indifferentism
towards
each
and
all
of
these
has
not
christ
been
present
alike
at
the
of
the
poor
dissenting
son
of
thunder
who
tore
god
word
into
shreds
at
the
tinklings
and
posturings
and
of
roman
pietism
and
even
at
the
learned
discourse
which
dissolved
the
myth
of
his
own
life
and
death
why
then
take
a
side
why
not
regard
all
phases
of
belief
or
with
equal
and
serene
regard
such
a
mood
of
amiable
indifferentism
is
abhorrent
to
browning
feelings
the
hem
of
robe
passes
wholly
at
this
point
from
the
hand
of
the
seer
of
visions
in
his
poem
one
best
way
of
worship
there
needs
must
be
ours
may
indeed
not
be
the
absolutely
best
but
it
is
our
part
it
is
our
probation
to
see
that
we
strive
earnestly
after
what
is
best
yes
and
strive
with
might
and
main
to
confer
upon
our
fellows
the
gains
which
we
have
found
it
may
be
god
part
we
trust
it
is
to
bring
all
wanderers
to
the
one
fold
at
last
as
for
us
we
must
seek
after
him
and
find
him
in
the
mode
required
by
our
highest
thought
our
purest
passion
here
browning
speaks
from
his
central
feeling
only
we
may
ask
what
if
one
truest
self
lie
somewhere
hidden
amid
a
thousand
hesitating
sympathies
and
is
not
the
world
spacious
enough
to
include
a
montaigne
as
well
as
a
pascal
or
a
browning
assuredly
the
world
without
its
montaigne
would
be
a
poorer
and
a
less
hospitable
for
the
spirits
of
men
mrs
browning
complained
to
her
husband
of
what
she
terms
the
asceticism
of
the
second
part
of
his
volume
of
his
reply
was
that
it
stated
one
side
of
the
question
do
think
mrs
browning
says
that
he
has
taken
to
the
cilix
indeed
he
has
not
but
it
is
his
way
to
things
as
passionately
as
other
people
them
has
nothing
to
say
of
religious
life
in
churches
and
societies
nothing
of
the
communities
of
public
worship
for
the
writer
of
this
poem
only
three
things
exist
god
the
individual
soul
and
the
world
regarded
as
the
testing
place
and
training
place
of
the
soul
browning
has
here
a
rigour
of
moral
or
spiritual
earnestness
which
may
be
called
by
any
one
who
so
pleases
puritan
in
its
kind
and
its
intensity
he
feels
the
need
if
we
are
to
attain
any
approximation
to
the
christian
ideal
of
the
lit
lamp
and
the
girt
loin
two
difficulties
in
the
christian
life
in
particular
he
chooses
to
consider
first
the
difficulty
of
faith
in
the
things
of
the
spirit
and
especially
in
what
he
regards
as
the
essential
parts
of
the
christian
story
and
secondly
the
difficulty
of
obeying
the
injunction
to
renounce
the
world
that
we
can
not
grow
to
our
highest
attainment
by
the
old
method
enjoined
by
pagan
philosophy
that
of
living
according
to
nature
he
regards
as
evident
for
nature
itself
is
warped
and
marred
it
groans
and
travails
and
from
its
discords
how
shall
we
frame
a
harmony
it
was
always
his
habit
of
mind
he
tells
us
from
his
childhood
onwards
to
face
a
danger
and
confront
a
doubt
and
if
there
were
anywhere
a
lurking
fear
to
draw
this
forth
from
its
and
examine
it
in
the
light
even
at
the
risk
of
some
mortal
ill
therefore
he
will
press
for
an
answer
to
his
present
questionings
he
will
try
conclusions
to
the
uttermost
as
to
the
initial
difficulty
of
faith
browning
with
a
touch
of
scorn
assures
us
that
evidences
of
spiritual
realities
evidences
of
christianity
as
they
are
styled
external
and
internal
will
be
readily
found
by
him
who
desires
to
find
convincing
enough
they
are
for
him
who
wants
to
be
convinced
but
in
truth
faith
is
a
noble
venture
of
the
spirit
an
aspiring
effort
towards
what
is
best
even
though
what
is
best
may
never
be
attained
the
mole
gropes
blindly
in
unquestionably
solid
clay
better
be
like
the
grasshopper
that
spends
itself
in
leaps
all
day
to
reach
the
sun
a
grasshopper
leap
sunwards
that
is
what
we
signify
by
this
word
faith
but
the
difficulties
of
the
christian
life
only
shift
their
place
when
faith
by
whatever
means
has
been
won
we
are
bidden
to
renounce
the
world
what
does
the
injunction
mean
in
what
way
shall
it
be
obeyed
ascetic
mrs
browning
named
this
poem
and
ascetic
it
is
if
by
that
word
we
understand
the
counselling
and
exhorting
to
a
noble
exercise
and
discipline
but
browning
even
in
his
poem
by
no
means
wears
the
cilix
and
no
teaching
can
be
more
fatal
than
his
to
asceticism
in
the
narrower
sense
of
the
word
to
renounce
the
world
if
interpreted
aright
is
to
extinguish
or
suppress
no
faculty
that
has
been
given
to
man
but
rather
to
put
each
faculty
to
its
highest
uses
renounce
the
world
ah
were
it
done
by
merely
cutting
one
by
one
your
limbs
off
with
your
wise
head
last
how
easy
were
it
how
soon
past
if
once
in
the
believing
mood
the
harder
and
the
higher
renunciation
is
this
to
choose
the
things
of
the
spirit
rather
than
the
things
of
sense
and
again
in
accepting
as
means
of
our
earthly
discipline
and
development
the
things
of
sense
to
press
through
these
to
the
things
of
the
spirit
which
lie
behind
and
beyond
and
above
them
such
and
such
alone
is
the
asceticism
to
which
browning
summons
his
disciple
it
is
the
asceticism
of
energy
not
that
of
atrophy
it
does
not
starve
the
senses
but
reinforces
the
spirit
it
results
not
in
a
cloistered
but
a
militant
virtue
a
certain
it
may
demand
but
the
becomes
the
condition
of
a
higher
joy
and
if
life
with
its
trials
frays
the
flesh
what
matters
it
when
the
light
of
the
spirit
shines
through
with
only
a
fuller
potency
in
the
choice
between
sense
and
spirit
or
to
put
it
more
generally
in
the
choice
between
what
is
higher
and
less
high
lies
the
probation
of
a
soul
and
also
its
means
of
growth
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
mortal
life
this
strange
phenomenon
otherwise
so
unintelligible
if
it
be
not
the
moment
in
which
a
soul
is
proved
the
period
in
which
a
soul
is
shaped
and
developed
for
other
lives
to
come
to
forget
that
browning
is
a
preacher
may
suit
a
dainty
kind
of
criticism
which
detaches
the
idea
of
beauty
from
the
total
of
our
humanity
addressed
by
the
greater
artists
but
the
solemn
thoughts
that
are
taken
up
by
beauty
in
such
work
for
example
as
that
of
michael
angelo
are
an
essential
element
or
an
essential
condition
of
its
peculiar
character
as
a
thing
of
beauty
and
armour
we
know
may
be
as
lovely
to
the
mere
senses
as
a
flower
browning
doctrine
may
sometimes
protrude
gauntly
through
his
poetry
but
at
his
best
as
in
ben
or
the
thought
of
the
poem
is
needful
in
the
dance
of
lyrical
enthusiasm
as
the
male
partner
who
takes
hands
with
beauty
and
to
separate
them
would
bring
the
dance
to
a
sudden
close
both
are
present
in
and
we
must
watch
the
movement
of
the
two
in
a
passage
already
quoted
from
the
face
of
christ
is
nobly
imagined
as
the
sun
which
bleaches
a
discoloured
web
here
the
imagination
is
as
intense
in
its
presentation
of
christ
the
doomsman
he
stood
there
like
the
smoke
pillared
sodom
when
day
broke
i
saw
him
one
magnific
pall
mantled
in
massive
fold
and
fall
his
head
and
coiled
in
snaky
swathes
about
his
feet
night
black
that
bathes
all
else
broke
grizzled
with
despair
against
the
soul
of
blackness
there
a
gesture
told
the
mood
within
that
wrapped
right
hand
which
based
the
chin
that
intense
meditation
fixed
on
his
procedure
pity
mixed
with
the
fulfilment
of
decree
motionless
thus
he
spoke
to
me
who
fell
before
his
feet
a
mass
no
man
now
the
picture
of
the
final
conflagration
of
the
judgment
day
is
perhaps
a
descriptive
de
horror
piled
upon
horror
with
accumulative
power
a
picture
somewhat
too
much
in
the
manner
of
martin
and
the
verse
does
not
lend
itself
to
the
sustained
sublimity
of
terror
the
glow
of
milton
hell
is
intenser
and
milton
majestic
instrumentation
alone
could
render
the
voices
of
its
flames
the
real
awfulness
of
browning
judgment
day
dwells
wholly
in
the
inner
experiences
of
a
solitary
soul
the
speaker
finds
of
a
sudden
that
the
doom
is
upon
him
and
that
in
the
probation
of
life
his
choice
was
earth
not
heaven
the
sentence
pronounced
upon
him
is
in
accordance
with
the
election
of
his
own
will
let
earth
with
all
its
beauty
of
nature
all
its
gifts
of
human
art
all
its
successes
of
the
intellect
as
he
had
conceived
and
chosen
them
be
his
to
his
despair
he
finds
that
what
he
had
prized
in
life
and
what
is
now
granted
to
him
can
not
bring
him
happiness
or
even
content
the
plenitude
of
beauty
of
which
all
partial
beauty
was
but
a
pledge
is
forever
lost
to
him
the
glory
of
art
which
lay
beyond
its
poor
actual
attainments
is
lost
the
joy
of
knowledge
with
all
those
grasps
of
guess
which
pull
the
more
into
the
less
is
lost
and
as
to
earth
best
possession
love
had
he
ever
made
a
discovery
through
human
love
of
that
which
it
forthshadows
the
love
that
is
perfect
and
divine
earth
is
no
longer
earth
to
the
doomed
man
but
the
star
of
the
god
rephan
of
which
we
read
in
one
of
latest
poems
in
the
horror
of
its
blank
and
passionless
uniformity
untroubled
by
any
spiritual
presences
he
cowers
at
the
judge
feet
and
prays
for
darkness
hunger
toil
distress
if
only
hope
be
also
granted
him
then
did
the
form
expand
expand
knew
him
through
the
dread
disguise
as
the
whole
god
within
his
eyes
embraced
me
the
doomsman
has
in
a
moment
become
the
saviour
in
all
this
if
browning
has
the
burden
of
a
prophecy
to
utter
he
utters
it
after
the
manner
of
earlier
prophets
as
a
vision
his
art
is
sensuous
and
passionate
his
argument
is
transformed
into
a
series
of
imaginative
experiences
browning
illness
during
the
summer
and
early
autumn
of
left
her
for
a
time
more
shaken
in
health
than
she
had
been
since
her
marriage
but
by
the
spring
of
the
following
year
she
had
recovered
strength
and
designs
of
travel
were
formed
which
should
include
rome
north
italy
switzerland
the
rhine
brussels
paris
and
london
almost
at
the
moment
of
starting
for
rome
at
the
end
of
april
the
plans
were
altered
the
season
was
too
far
advanced
for
going
south
ways
and
means
must
be
economised
rome
might
be
postponed
for
a
future
visit
and
venice
would
make
amends
for
the
present
sacrifice
and
venice
in
may
and
early
june
did
indeed
for
a
time
make
amends
i
have
been
between
heaven
and
earth
browning
wrote
since
our
arrival
at
venice
the
rich
architecture
the
colour
the
moonlight
the
music
the
enchanting
silence
made
up
a
unity
of
pleasures
like
nothing
that
she
had
previously
known
when
evening
came
she
and
her
husband
would
follow
the
opera
from
their
box
hired
for
two
shillings
and
eightpence
english
or
sit
under
the
moon
in
the
piazza
of
st
mark
sipping
coffee
and
reading
the
french
papers
but
as
the
month
went
by
browning
lost
appetite
and
lost
sleep
the
soothing
lulling
rocking
atmosphere
which
suited
browning
made
him
after
the
first
excitement
of
delight
grow
nervous
and
dispirited
they
hastened
away
to
padua
drove
to
arqua
for
petrarch
sake
passed
through
brescia
in
a
flood
of
white
moonlight
and
having
reached
milan
climbed
the
invalid
of
wimpole
street
and
her
husband
to
the
topmost
point
of
the
cathedral
from
the
italian
lakes
they
crossed
by
the
st
gothard
to
switzerland
and
omitting
part
of
their
original
scheme
of
wandering
journeyed
in
hours
without
stopping
from
strasburg
to
paris
in
paris
they
loitered
for
three
weeks
browning
during
the
short
visit
which
followed
her
marriage
had
hardly
seen
the
city
bright
before
which
little
wiedemann
would
scream
with
pleasure
restaurants
and
dinners
la
trees
and
gardens
in
the
heart
of
the
town
were
a
not
unwelcome
exchange
for
italian
and
even
disreputable
prints
and
fascinating
hats
and
caps
were
appreciated
as
proper
to
the
genius
of
the
place
and
the
writer
of
guidi
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
her
hero
le
president
in
a
cocked
hat
and
with
a
train
of
cavalry
passing
like
a
rocket
along
the
boulevards
to
an
occasional
yell
from
the
red
by
a
happy
chance
they
lighted
in
paris
upon
tennyson
now
whom
browning
had
hitherto
known
only
through
his
poems
he
was
in
the
friendliest
mood
and
urged
that
they
should
make
use
of
his
house
and
servants
during
their
stay
in
england
an
offer
which
was
not
refused
though
there
was
no
intention
of
actually
taking
advantage
of
the
kindness
as
for
england
the
thought
of
it
with
her
father
heart
and
her
father
door
closed
against
her
was
bitter
as
wormwood
to
browning
it
only
robert
she
wrote
who
is
a
patriot
now
of
us
two
english
soil
as
they
stepped
ashore
was
a
puddle
and
english
air
a
fog
london
lodgings
were
taken
at
devonshire
street
and
although
browning
suffered
from
the
climate
they
were
soon
dizzied
and
dazzled
by
the
whirl
of
pleasant
hospitalities
an
evening
with
carlyle
one
of
the
greatest
sights
in
england
a
dinner
given
by
forster
at
thames
ditton
in
sight
of
the
swans
a
breakfast
with
rogers
daily
visits
of
barry
cornwall
cordial
companionship
of
jameson
a
performance
by
the
literary
guild
actors
a
reading
of
by
fanny
kemble
with
these
distractions
and
such
as
these
the
two
months
flew
quickly
it
was
in
some
ways
a
relief
when
pen
faithful
maid
wilson
went
for
a
fortnight
to
see
her
kinsfolk
and
browning
had
to
take
her
place
and
substitute
for
social
racketing
domestic
cares
the
one
central
sorrow
remained
and
in
some
respects
was
intensified
she
had
written
to
her
father
and
browning
himself
wrote
a
manly
true
letter
she
informs
a
friend
everywhere
generous
and
conciliating
a
violent
and
unsparing
reply
was
made
and
with
it
came
all
the
letters
that
his
undutiful
daughter
had
written
to
barrett
not
one
had
been
read
or
opened
he
returned
them
now
because
he
had
not
previously
known
how
he
could
be
relieved
of
the
obnoxious
documents
god
takes
it
all
into
his
own
hands
wrote
browning
and
i
wait
something
however
was
gained
her
brothers
were
reconciled
arabella
barrett
was
constant
in
kindness
and
henrietta
journeyed
from
taunton
to
london
to
enjoy
a
week
in
her
company
it
was
at
devonshire
street
that
bayard
taylor
the
distinguished
american
poet
and
critic
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
brownings
and
the
record
of
his
visit
gives
a
picture
of
browning
at
the
age
of
so
clearly
and
firmly
drawn
that
it
ought
not
to
be
omitted
here
in
a
small
on
the
first
floor
i
met
browning
who
received
me
with
great
cordiality
in
his
lively
cheerful
manner
quick
voice
and
perfect
he
made
the
impression
of
an
american
rather
than
an
englishman
he
was
then
i
should
judge
about
years
of
age
but
his
dark
hair
was
already
streaked
with
gray
about
the
temples
his
complexion
was
fair

the
strong
individuality
which
marks
his

was
expressed
not

in

in
his
whole
demeanour
he
was
about
the

by

curls
and

also

presently
entered
to
the

pen
a
boy
who
babbled
his
little
sentences
in
italian
when
towards
the
close
of
september
browning
and
his
wife
left
london
for
paris
carlyle
by
his
own
request
was
their
companion
on
the
journey
mrs
browning
feared
that
his
irritable
nerves
would
suffer
from
the
vivacities
of
little
pen
but
it
was
not
so
he
accepted
with
good
humour
the
fact
that
the
small
boy
had
not
yet
learned
like
his
own
teufelsdr√∂ckh
the
eternal
no
why
sir
exclaimed
carlyle
you
have
as
many
aspirations
as
napoleon
at
dieppe
browning
as
carlyle
records
did
everything
fought
for
us
and
we
that
is
the
woman
the
child
and
i
had
only
to
wait
and
be
silent
at
paris
in
the
midst
of
a
crowding
jangling
vociferous
tumult
the
brave
browning
fought
for
us
leaving
me
to
sit
beside
the
woman
an
apartment
was
found
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
avenue
des
pretty
cheerful
carpeted
rooms
far
brighter
and
better
than
those
of
devonshire
street
and
when
to
browning
amusement
his
wife
had
moved
every
chair
and
table
into
the
new
and
absolutely
right
position
they
could
rest
and
be
thankful
carlyle
spent
several
evenings
with
them
and
repaid
the
assistance
which
he
received
in
various
difficulties
from
command
of
the
language
by
picturesque
conversations
in
his
native
speech
you
come
to
understand
perfectly
wrote
mrs
browning
when
you
know
him
that
his
bitterness
is
only
melancholy
and
his
scorn
sensibility
a
little
later
browning
father
and
sister
spent
some
weeks
in
paris
here
at
all
events
were
perfect
relations
between
the
members
of
a
family
group
the
daughter
here
was
her
father
comrade
with
something
even
of
a
maternal
instinct
and
the
grandfather
discovered
to
his
great
satisfaction
that
his
own
talent
for
drawing
had
descended
to
his
grandchild
the
time
was
one
when
the
surface
of
life
in
paris
showed
an
unruffled
aspect
but
under
the
surface
were
heavings
of
inward
agitation
on
the
morning
of
december
the
great
stroke
against
the
republic
was
delivered
the
was
an
accomplished
fact
later
in
the
day
louis
napoleon
rode
under
the
windows
of
the
apartment
in
the
avenue
des
from
the
carrousel
to
the
arc
de
to
mrs
browning
it
seemed
the
grandest
of
spectacles
he
rode
there
in
the
name
of
the
people
after
all
she
and
her
husband
had
witnessed
revolutions
in
florence
and
political
upheavals
did
not
seem
so
very
formidable
on
the
thursday
of
bloodshed
in
the
streets
december
pen
was
taken
out
for
his
usual
walk
though
not
without
certain
precautions
as
the
day
advanced
the
excitement
grew
tense
and
when
night
fell
the
distant
firing
on
the
boulevards
kept
browning
from
her
bed
till
one
on
saturday
they
took
a
carriage
and
drove
to
see
the
field
of
action
the
crowds
moved
to
and
fro
discussing
the
situation
but
of
real
disturbance
there
was
none
next
day
the
theatres
had
their
customary
spectators
and
the
its
promenaders
for
the
dishonoured

egalit√©
fraternit√©
as
browning
heard
it
suggested

now
be
inscribed
infanterie
cavallerie

such
may
have
been
her
husband
opinion
but
such
was
not
hers
her
faith
in
the
president
had
been
now
and
again
shaken
her
faith
in
the
emperor

of

their

viewed

more
critically
more

viii
to
it
was
during
the
month
of
the
that
browning
went
back
in
thought
to
the
poet
of
his
youthful
love
and
wrote
that
essay
which
was
prefixed
to
the
volume
of
forged
letters
published
as
shelley
by
moxon
in
the
essay
is
interesting
as
browning
only
considerable
piece
of
prose
and
also
as
an
utterance
made
not
through
the
mask
of
any
but
openly
and
directly
from
his
own
lips
though
not
without
value
as
a
contribution
to
the
study
of
shelley
genius
it
is
perhaps
chiefly
of
importance
as
an
exposition
of
some
of
own
views
concerning
his
art
he
distinguishes
between
two
kinds
or
types
of
poet
the
poet
who
like
shakespeare
is
primarily
the
fashioner
of
things
independent
of
his
own
personality
artistic
creations
which
embody
some
fact
or
reality
leaving
it
to
others
to
interpret
as
best
they
are
able
its
significance
and
secondly
the
poet
who
is
rather
a
seer
than
a
fashioner
who
attempts
to
exhibit
in
imaginative
form
his
own
conceptions
of
absolute
truth
conceptions
far
from
entire
adequacy
yet
struggling
towards
completeness
the
poet
who
would
shadow
forth
as
he
himself
apprehends
them
to
use
the
word
of
plato
seeds
of
creation
lying
burningly
on
the
divine
hand
which
ideas
he
discovers
not
so
often
in
the
external
world
as
in
his
own
soul
this
being
for
him
the
nearest
reflex
of
the
absolute
mind
what
a
poet
of
this
second
kind
produces
as
browning
finely
states
it
will
be
less
a
work
than
an
effluence
he
is
attracted
among
external
phenomena
chiefly
by
those
which
summon
forth
his
inner
light
and
power
he
selects
that
silence
of
the
earth
and
sea
in
which
he
can
best
hear
the
beating
of
his
individual
heart
and
leaves
the
noisy
complex
yet
imperfect
exhibitions
of
nature
in
the
manifold
experience
of
man
around
him
which
serve
only
to
distract
and
suppress
the
working
of
his
brain
to
this
latter
class
of
poets
although
in
and
and
he
is
eminent
as
a
fashioner
shelley
conspicuously
belongs
mankind
can
not
wisely
dispense
with
the
services
of
either
type
of
poet
at
one
time
it
chiefly
needs
to
have
that
which
is
already
known
interpreted
into
its
highest
meanings
and
at
another
when
the
virtue
of
these
interpretations
has
been
appropriated
and
exhausted
it
needs
a
fresh
study
and
exploration
of
the
facts
of
life
and
nature
for
the
world
is
not
to
be
learned
and
thrown
aside
but
reverted
to
and
relearned
the
truest
and
highest
point
of
view
from
which
to
regard
the
poetry
of
shelley
is
that
which
shows
it
as
a
sublime
fragmentary
essay
towards
a
presentment
of
the
correspondency
of
the
universe
to
deity
of
the
natural
to
the
spiritual
and
of
the
actual
to
the
ideal
for
browning
the
poet
of
was
not
that
beautiful
and
ineffectual
angel
of
matthew
arnold
fancy
beating
in
the
void
his
luminous
wings
a
great
moral
purpose
looked
forth
from
shelley
work
as
it
does
browning
would
add
from
all
lofty
works
of
art
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
the
criticism
of
browning
own
writings
which
considers
not
only
their
artistic
methods
and
artistic
success
or
failure
but
also
their
ethical
and
spiritual
purport
is
entirely
in
accord
with
his
thoughts
in
this
essay
far
from
regarding
shelley
as
unpractical
he
notes
and
with
perfect
justice
the
peculiar
practicalness
of
shelley
mind
which
in
his
earlier
years
acted
injuriously
upon
both
his
conduct
and
his
art
his
power
to
perceive
the
defects
of
society
was
accompanied
by
as
precocious
a
fertility
to
contrive
remedies
but
his
crudeness
in
theorising
and
his
inexperience
in
practice
resulted
in
not
a
few
youthful
errors
gradually
he
left
behind
him
this
low
practical
dexterity
gradually
he
learnt
that
the
best
way
of
removing
abuses
is
to
stand
fast
by
truth
truth
is
one
as
they
are
manifold
and
innumerable
negative
effects
are
produced
by
the
upholding
of
one
positive
principle
browning
urges
that
shelley
before
the
close
had
passed
from
his
doctrinaire
atheism
to
what
was
virtually
a
theistic
faith
i
shall
say
what
i
think
he
adds
had
shelley
lived
he
would
have
finally
ranged
himself
with
the
christians
the
preliminary
step
to
following
christ
is
the
leaving
the
dead
to
bury
their
dead
perhaps
this
hypothetical
anticipation
is
to
be
classed
with
the
surmise
of
cardinal
wiseman
if
father
prout
rightly
attributed
to
that
eminent
ecclesiastic
a
review
of
and
in
that
browning
himself
would
one
day
be
found
in
the
ranks
of
converts
to
catholicism
in
each
case
a
wish
was
father
to
the
thought
browning
recognised
the
fact
that
shelley
assigned
a
place
to
love
side
by
side
with
power
among
the
forces
which
determine
the
life
and
development
of
humanity
and
with
browning
himself
power
was
a
synonym
for
the
divine
will
and
love
was
often
an
equivalent
for
god
manifest
in
jesus
christ
one
or
two
other
passages
of
the
essay
may
be
noted
as
illustrating
certain
characteristics
of
the
writer
modes
of
thought
and
feeling
everywhere
is
apparent
shelley
belief
in
the
existence
of
good
to
which
evil
is
an
accident
it
is
an
optimist
here
though
of
a
subtler
doctrine
than
shelley
who
is
applauding
optimism
shelley
was
tender
though
tenderness
is
not
always
the
characteristic
of
very
sincere
natures
he
was
eminently
both
tender
and
sincere
was
browning
consulting
his
own
heart
which
was
always
sincere
and
could
be
tender
but
whose
tenderness
sometimes
disappeared
in
explosions
of
indignant
wrath
the
principle
again
by
which
he
determined
an
artist
rank
is
in
harmony
with
browning
general
feeling
that
men
are
to
be
judged
less
by
their
actual
achievements
than
by
the
possibilities
that
lie
unfolded
within
them
and
the
ends
to
which
they
aspire
even
though
such
ends
be
unattained
in
the
hierarchy
of
creative
minds
it
is
the
presence
of
the
highest
faculty
that
gives
first
rank
in
virtue
of
its
kind
not
degree
no
pretension
of
a
lower
nature
whatever
the
completeness
of
development
or
variety
of
effect
impeding
the
precedency
of
the
rarer
endowment
though
only
in
the
germ
and
last
of
the
tardy
recognition
of
shelley
genius
as
a
poet
browning
wrote
in
words
which
though
as
he
himself
says
he
had
always
good
praisers
no
doubt
express
a
thought
that
helped
to
sustain
him
against
the
indifference
of
the
public
to
his
poetry
the
misapprehensiveness
of
his
age
is
exactly
what
a
poet
is
sent
to
remedy
and
the
interval
between
his
operation
and
the
generally
perceptible
effect
of
it
is
no
greater
less
indeed
than
in
many
other
departments
of
the
great
human
effort
the
pur
si
muove
of
the
astronomer
was
as
bitter
a
word
as
any
uttered
before
or
since
by
a
poet
over
his
rejected
living
work
in
that
depth
of
conviction
which
is
so
like
despair
the
volume
in
which
browning
essay
appeared
was
withdrawn
from
circulation
on
the
discovery
of
the
fraudulent
nature
of
its
contents
he
had
himself
no
opportunity
of
inspecting
the
forged
manuscripts
and
no
question
of
authenticity
was
raised
until
several
copies
of
the
book
had
passed
into
circulation
during
the
nine
months
spent
in
paris
from
september
to
june
browning
enlarged
the
circle
of
his
friends
and
made
some
new
and
interesting
acquaintances
chief
among
friendships
was
that
with
joseph
milsand
of
dijon
whose
name
is
connected
with
in
the
edition
of
browning
poetical
works
of
the
year
under
the
title
la
po√©sie
anglaise
depuis
byron
two
articles
by
milsand
were
contributed
to
the
revue
des
deux
mondes
the
first
on
tennyson
the
second
published
august
a
little
before
the
poet
arrival
in
paris
on
robert
browning
of
all
the
poets
known
to
me
wrote
his
french
critic
he
is
the
most
capable
of
summing
up
the
conceptions
of
the
religion
the
ethics
and
the
theoretic
knowledge
of
our
period
in
forms
which
embody
the
beauty
proper
to
such
abstractions
such
criticism
by
a
thoughtful
student
of
our
literature
could
not
but
prepare
the
way
pleasantly
for
personal
acquaintance
milsand
we
are
told
by
his
friend
th
bentzon
mme
blanc
having
hesitated
as
to
the
propriety
of
printing
a
passage
in
an
article
as
yet
unpublished
in
which
he
had
spoken
of
the
great
sorrow
of
mrs
browning
early
life
the
death
of
her
brother
went
straight
to
browning
who
was
then
in
paris
and
declared
that
he
was
ready
to
cancel
what
he
had
written
if
it
would
cause
her
pain
only
a
frenchman
exclaimed
browning
grasping
both
hands
of
his
visitor
would
have
done
this
so
began
a
friendship
of
an
intimate
and
most
helpful
kind
which
closed
only
with
milsand
death
in
to
his
memory
is
dedicated
the
volume
published
soon
after
his
death
with
certain
people
of
i
never
knew
or
shall
know
his
like
among
men
wrote
browning
and
again
no
words
can
express
the
love
i
have
for
him
and
in
cotton
nightcap
it
is
milsand
who
is
characterised
in
the
lines
he
knows
more
and
loves
better
than
the
world
that
never
heard
his
name
and
never
may
what
hinders
that
my
heart
relieve
itself
o
friend
who
makest
warm
my
wintry
world
and
wise
my
heaven
if
there
we
consort
too
in
the
correction
of
browning
and
especially
in
regulating
the
punctuation
of
his
poems
milsand
friendly
services
were
of
high
value
in
when
browning
happened
to
be
at
dijon
and
had
reason
to
believe
though
in
fact
erroneously
that
his
friend
was
absent
in
paris
he
went
twice
in
a
passion
of
friendship
as
his
wife
tells
a
correspondent
to
stand
before
maison
milsand
and
muse
and
bless
the
threshold
browning
desired
much
to
know
victor
hugo
but
his
wish
was
never
gratified
after
december
paris
could
not
contain
a
spirit
so
fiery
as
hugo
was
in
hostility
to
the
new
r√©gime
and
its
chief
representative
balzac
whom
it
would
have
been
a
happiness
even
to
look
at
was
dead
lamartine
promised
a
visit
but
for
a
time
his
coming
was
delayed
by
a
mischance
alfred
de

failed
to
appear
when

expecting
to
meet

was
the
guest
of

but
b√©ranger
was
to
be
seen
in

white
hat
wandering
along

asphalte
the
blind
historian
thierry
begged
browning
and
his
wife
to
call
upon
him
at
the
house
of
ary
scheffer
the
painter
they
heard
mme
viardot
sing
and
receptions
given
by

and
mme

were
means
of
introduction
to
much
that
was
interesting
in
the
social
life
of
paris
at
the
theatre
they
saw
with
the
deepest
excitement

protected
by

from
the
rain
of
tears
that
fell
from
the
boxes
tears
indeed
ran
down
browning
cheeks
though
he
had
believed
himself
hardened
against
theatrical
pathos
mrs
browning
cried
herself
ill
and
pronounced
the
play
painful
but
profoundly
moral
mrs

admiration
of
the

was
so
great
that
it
would
have
been
a
sore
disappointment
to
her
if
george
sand
were
to
prove
inaccessible
a
letter
of
introduction
to
her
had
been
obtained
from
mazzini
ah
i
am
so
vexed
about
george
sand
mrs
browning
wrote
on
christmas
eve
she
came
she
has
gone
and
we
met
in
february
she
again
was
known
to
be
for
a
few
days
in
paris
browning
was
not
eager
to
push
through
difficulties
on
the
chance
of
obtaining
an
interview
but
his
wife
was
all
impatience
no
said
i
be
proud
and
i
be
proud
and
we
see
her
i
wo
die
if
i
can
help
it
without
seeing
george
sand
a
gracious
reply
and
an
appointment
came
in
response
to
their
which
accompanied
mazzini
letter
on
the
appointed
sunday
browning
and
mrs
browning
she
wearing
a
respirator
and
smothered
in
furs
drove
to
render
their
thanks
and
homage
to
the
most
illustrious
of
frenchwomen
mrs
browning
with
beating
heart
stooped
and
kissed
her
hand
they
found
in
george
sand
face
no
sweetness
but
great
moral
and
intellectual
capacities
in
manners
and
conversation
she
was
absolutely
simple
young
men
formed
the
company
to
whom
she
addressed
counsel
and
command
with
the
utmost
freedom
and
a
conscious
authority
through
all
her
speech
a
certain
undercurrent
of
scorn
a
touch
of
disdain
was
perceptible
at
their
parting
she
invited
the
english
visitors
to
come
again
kissed
mrs
browning
on
the
lips
and
received
browning
kiss
upon
her
hand
the
second
call
upon
her
was
less
agreeable
she
sat
warming
her
feet
in
a
circle
of
eight
or
nine
men
representatives
of
the
ragged
red
diluted
with
the
lower
theatrical
if
any
other
mistress
of
a
house
had
behaved
so
unceremoniously
browning
declared
that
he
would
have
walked
out
of
the
room
and
mrs
browning
left
with
the
impression
she
does
not
care
for
me
they
had
exerted
themselves
to
please
her
but
felt
that
it
was
in
vain
we
could
penetrate
could
really
her
once
browning
met
her
near
the
tuileries
and
walked
the
length
of
the
gardens
with
her
arm
upon
his
if
nothing
further
was
to
come
of
it
at
least
they
had
seen
a
wonderful
piece
of
work
which
not
to
have
been
blest
withal
would
have
discredited
their
travel
only
to
mrs
browning
mortification
the
spectacle
wanted
one
detail
indispensable
to
its
completeness
the
characteristic
cigarette
was
absent
ah
but
i
did
see
her
smoke
life
leaves
us
always
something
to
desire
before
the
close
of
june
they
were
again
in
london
and
found
comfortable
rooms
at
welbeck
street
when
the
turmoil
of
the
first
days
had
subsided
they
visited
kenyon
the
magnificent
so
named
by
browning
at
wimbledon
at
whose
table
landor
abounding
in
life
and
passionate
energy
as
in
earlier
days
was
loud
in
his
applause
of
the
genius
of
louis
napoleon
mazzini
his
intense
eyes
full
of
melancholy
illusions
called
at
their
lodgings
in
company
with
mrs
carlyle
who
seemed
to
mrs
browning
not
only
remarkable
for
her
play
of
ideas
but
attaching
through
her
feelings
and
her
character
florence
nightingale
was
also
a
welcome
visitor
and
her
visit
was
followed
by
a
gift
of
flowers
invitations
from
country
houses
came
in
sheaves
and
the
thought
of
green
fields
is
seductive
in
a
london
month
of
july
but
to
remain
in
london
was
to
be
faithful
to
penini
and
to
the
flush
once
the
whole
household
with
flush
included
breathed
rural
air
for
two
days
with
friends
at
farnham
and
browning
had
there
the
pleasure
of
meeting
charles
kingsley
whose
christian
socialism
seemed
wild
and
unpractical
enough
but
as
for
the
man
himself
brave
bold
original
full
of
a
genial
kindliness
mrs
browning
assures
a
correspondent
that
he
could
not
be
other
than
good
and
noble
let
him
say
or
dream
what
he
will
it
is
stated
by
mr
rossetti
that
browning
first
became
acquainted
with
his
brother
dante
gabriel
in
the
course
of
this
summer
coventry
patmore
gave
him
the
manuscript
of
his
unpublished
poems
of
to
read
and
ruskin
was
now
added
to
the
number
of
his
personal
acquaintances
we
went
to
denmark
hill
yesterday
by
agreement
wrote
mrs
browning
in
september
to
see
the
turners
which
by
the
way
are
divine
i
like
mr
ruskin
much
and
so
does
robert
very
gentle
yet
earnest
refined
and
truthful
at
lord
stanhope
they
were
introduced
to
the
latest
toy
of
fashionable
occultism
the
crystal
ball
in
which
the
seer
beheld
oremus
the
spirit
of
the
sun
the
supernatural
was
qualified
for
the
faithful
with
luncheon
and
lobster
salad
i
love
the
marvellous
mrs
browning
frankly
declares
and
of
terrestrial
wonders
with
heaven
lying
about
them
and
also
india
muslin
and
brussels
lace
two
were
seen
in
the
babies
of
monckton
milnes
and
alfred
tennyson
pen
because
he
was
troppo
grande
declined
to
kiss
the
first
of
these
wonders
but
pen
father
who
went
alone
to
the
baptism
of
hallam
tennyson
distinguished
himself
by
nursing
for
some
ten
minutes
and
with
accomplished
dexterity
the
future
of
australia
yet
with
all
these
distractions
perhaps
in
part
because
of
them
the
visit
to
england
was
not
one
of
browning
happiest
times
the
autumn
weather
confined
mrs
browning
to
her
rooms
he
was
anxious
vexed
and
worn
it
was
a
happiness
when
welbeck
street
was
left
behind
and
they
were
on
the
way
by
paris
to
their
at
casa
guidi
from
a
balcony
overlooking
one
of
the
paris
boulevards
they
witnessed
in
a
blaze
of
autumnal
sunshine
which
glorified
much
military
and
civic
pomp
the
reception
of
the
new
emperor
mrs
browning
handkerchief
waved
frantically
while
she
prayed
that
god
might
bless
the
people
in
this
the
chosen
representative
of
a
democracy
what
were
thoughts
on
that
memorable
saturday
is
not
recorded
but
we
may
be
sure
that
they
were
less
enthusiastic
yet
he
enjoyed
the
stir
and
animation
of
paris
and
after
the
palpitating
life
of
the
boulevards
found
florence
dull
and
dead
no
change
no
variety
the
journey
by
the
mont
cenis
route
had
not
been
without
its
trying
incidents
at
genoa
during
several
days
he
was
deeply
depressed
by
the
illness
of
his
wife
who
lay
on
the
sofa
and
seemed
to
waste
away
but
casa
guidi
was
reached
at
last
where
it
was
more
like
summer
than
november
the
pleasant
nest
had
its
own
peculiar
welcome
for
wanderers
again
they
enjoyed
the
sunsets
over
the
arno
and
mrs
browning
was
able
to
report
herself
free
from
cough
and
feeling
very
well
and
very
happy
you
ca
think
how
we
have
caught
up
our
ancient
traditions
just
where
we
left
them
and
relapsed
into
our
former
soundless
stirless
hermit
life
robert
has
not
passed
an
evening
from
home
since
we
came
just
as
if
we
had
never
known
paris
the
political
condition
of
italy
was
indeed
a
grief
to
both
husband
and
wife
it
was
a
state
of
utter
prostration
on
all
sides
the
unanimity
of
despair
the
grand
duke
the
emancipator
had
acquired
a
respect
and
affection
for
the
bayonets
of
austria
the
pope
was
wriggling
his
venom
into
the
heart
of
all
possibilities
of
and
action
browning
groaned
how
long
o
lord
how
long
his
of
england
in
contrast
with
italy
were
those
of
patriotism
and
pride
his
wife
was
more
detached
more
critical
towards
her
native
land
the
best
symptom
for
italian
freedom
was
that
if
italy
had
not
energy
to
act
she
yet
had
energy
to
hate
to
be
happy
now
they
both
must
turn
to
imaginative
work
and
gain
all
the
gains
possible
from
private
friendships
browning
was
already
occupied
with
the
poems
included
afterwards
in
the
volumes
of
and
mrs
browning
was
already
engaged
upon
we
neither
of
us
show
our
work
to
one
another
she
wrote
till
it
is
finished
an
artist
must
i
fancy
either
find
or
a
solitude
to
work
in
if
it
is
to
be
good
work
at
all
but
as
her
husband
poems
one
by
one
were
completed
she
saw
them
and
they
seemed
to
her
as
fine
as
anything
he
had
done
away
in
england
was
given
on
the
stage
with
helen
faucit
in
the
leading
part
it
was
at
least
an
indication
that
the
public
had
not
forgotten
that
browning
was
a
poet
here
in
florence
although
the
hermit
life
was
happy
new
friends
the
gift
of
england
added
to
its
happiness
frederick
tennyson
the
laureate
brother
and
himself
a
true
poet
in
his
degree
a
dreamy
shy
speculative
man
simple
withal
and
truthful
had
married
an
italian
wife
and
was
settled
for
a
time
in
florence
to
him
browning
became
attached
with
genuine
affection
mrs
browning
was
a
student
of
the
writings
of
swedenborg
and
she
tells
much
of
her
new
friend
in
a
single
swedenborgian
word
selfhood
the
is
not
in
him
frederick
tennyson
though
left
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
by
browning
poetry
found
the
writer
of
the
poetry
a
man
of
infinite
learning
jest
and
bonhommie
and
moreover
a
sterling
heart
that
reverbs
no
hollowness
another
intimate
who
charmed
them
much
was
one
of
the
attach√©s
of
the
english
embassy
and
a
poet
of
unquestionable
faculty
very
young
very
gentle
and
refined
delicate
and
excitable
full
of
sensibility
full
of
all
sorts
of
goodness
and
nobleness
but
somewhat
dreamy
and
unpractical
visionary
enough
writes
mrs
browning
to
suit
me
interested
moreover
in
spiritualism
which
suited
her
well
never
she
unwisely
prophesied
to
be
a
great
diplomatist
it
was
hardly
mr
kenyon
the
editor
of
her
letters
observes
a
successful
horoscope
of
the
destiny
of
lord
lytton
the
future
ambassador
at
paris
and
viceroy
of
india
early
in
mrs
browning
became
much
interested
in
the
reports
which
reached
her
many
of
these
from
america
of
the
rapping
spirits
who
in
the
were
busy
in
instructing
chairs
and
tables
to
walk
in
the
way
they
should
not
go
you
know
i
am
rather
a
visionary
she
wrote
to
miss
mitford
and
inclined
to
knock
round
at
all
the
doors
of
the
present
world
to
try
to
get
out
her
swedenborgian
studies
had
prepared
her
to
believe
that
there
were
communities
of
life
in
the
visible
and
the
invisible
worlds
which
did
not
permit
of
the
one
being
wholly
estranged
from
the
other
a
clever
person
who
loves
the
marvellous
will
soon
find
by
the
sheer
force
of
logic
that
marvels
are
the
most
natural
things
in
the
world
should
we
not
credit
human
testimony
should
we
not
evict
prejudice
from
our
understandings
should
we
not
investigate
alleged
facts
should
we
not
keep
an
open
mind
we
can
not
but
feel
a
certain
sympathy
with
a
woman
of
ardent
nature
who
fails
to
observe
the
bounds
of
intellectual
prudence
browning
himself
with
all
his
audacities
was
prudent
he
did
not
actively
enter
into
politics
he
did
not
dabble
in
he
was
an
artist
and
a
thinker
and
he
made
poems
and
amused
himself
with
drawing
modelling
in
clay
and
the
study
of
music
mrs
browning
squandered
her
enthusiasms
with
less
discretion
a
good
dose
of
stupidity
or
an
indignant
energy
of
impatient
of
the
nonsense
of
the
thing
may
be
the
salvation
of
the
average
man
it
is
often
the
clever
people
who
would
be
entirely
rational
and
unprejudiced
that
best
succeed
in
duping
themselves
at
once
by
their
reason
and
their
folly
a
fine
old
crusted
prejudice
commonly
stands
for
a
thousand
acts
of
judgment
amassed
into
a
convenient
working
result
a
single
act
of
an
individual
understanding
or
several
of
such
acts
will
seldom
contain
an
equal
sum
of
wisdom
scientific
discovery
is
not
advanced
by
a
multitude
of
curious
and
ingenious
amateurs
in
learned
folly
whether
the
claims
of
spiritualism
are
warrantable
or
fallacious
mrs
browning
gifted
as
she
was
with
rare
powers
of
mind
was
not
qualified
to
investigate
those
claims
it
was
a
waste
of
energy
from
which
she
could
not
but
suffer
serious
risks
and
certain
loss
before
she
had
seen
anything
for
herself
she
was
a
believer
a
believer
as
she
describes
it
on
testimony
the
fact
of
communication
with
the
invisible
world
appeared
to
her
more
important
than
anything
that
had
been
communicated
the
spirits
themselves
seem
abundantly
foolish
one
must
admit
yet
it
was
clear
to
her
that
mankind
was
being
prepared
for
some
great
development
of
truth
she
would
keep
her
eyes
wide
open
to
facts
and
her
soul
lifted
up
in
reverential
expectation
she
felt
the
dumb
wood
of
the
table
panting
and
shivering
with
human
emotion
the
dogmatism
of
faraday
in
an
inadequate
theory
was
simply
unscientific
a
piece
of
intellectual
tyranny
the
american
medium
home
she
learnt
from
her
friends
was
turning
the
world
upside
down
in
london
with
this
spiritual
influx
two
months
later
in
july
mrs
browning
and
her
husband
were
themselves
in
london
and
witnessed
performances
during
a
s√©ance
at
ealing
miss
de
gaudrion
afterwards
mrs
merrifield
who
was
present
on
that
occasion
and
who
was
convinced
that
the
manifestations
were
a
fraud
wrote
to
mrs
browning
for
an
expression
of
her
opinion
the
reply
as
might
be
expected
declared
the
writer
belief
in
the
genuine
character
of
the
phenomena
such
manifestations
she
admitted
in
the
undeveloped
state
of
the
subject
were
apt
to
be
low
but
they
were
she
was
assured
the
beginning
of
access
from
a
spiritual
world
of
which
we
shall
presently
learn
more
perhaps
a
letter
volunteered
by
browning
accompanied
that
of
his
wife
he
had
he
said
to
overcome
a
real
repugnance
in
recalling
the
subject
he
could
hardly
understand
how
another
opinion
was
possible
than
that
the
whole
display
of
utterances
was
a
cheat
and
imposture
it
was
all
melancholy
stuff
which
a
grain
of
worldly
wisdom
would
dispose
of
in
a
minute
mr
browning
the
letter
goes
on
has
however
abundant
experience
that
the
best
and
rarest
of
natures
may
begin
by
the
proper
mistrust
of
the
more
ordinary
results
of
reasoning
when
employed
in
such
investigations
as
these
go
on
to
an
abnegation
of
the
regular
tests
of
truth
and
rationality
in
favour
of
these
particular
experiments
and
end
in
a
voluntary
prostration
of
the
whole
intelligence
before
what
is
assumed
to
transcend
all
intelligence
once
arrived
at
this
point
no
trick
is
too
gross
absurdities
are
referred
to
spirits
falsehoods
to
spirits
and
the
one
terribly
apparent
spirit
the
father
of
lies
has
it
all
his
own
way
these
interesting
letters
were
communicated
to
by
mr
merrifield
and
they
called
forth
a
short
additional
letter
from
mr
barrett
browning
the
penini
of
earlier
days
he
mentions
that
his
father
had
himself
on
one
occasion
detected
home
in
a
vulgar
fraud
that
home
had
called
at
the
house
of
the
brownings
and
was
turned
out
of
it
mr
browning
adds
what
however
i
am
more
desirous
of
stating
is
that
towards
the
end
of
her
life
my
mother
views
on
manifestations
were
much
modified
this
change
was
brought
about
in
great
measure
by
the
discovery
that
she
had
been
duped
by
a
friend
in
whom
she
had
blind
faith
the
pain
of
the
disillusion
was
great
but
her
eyes
were
opened
and
she
saw
clearly
it
must
be
added
that
letters
written
by
mrs
browning
six
months
before
her
death
give
no
indication
of
this
change
of
feeling
but
she
admits
that
sublime
communications
from
the
other
world
are
decidedly
absent
and
that
while
no
truth
can
be
dangerous
unsettled
minds
may
lose
their
balance
and
may
do
wisely
to
avoid
altogether
the
subject
of
spiritualism
browning
hostility
arose
primarily
from
his
conviction
that
the
manifestations
were
as
he
says
a
cheat
and
imposture
he
had
grasped
home
leg
under
the
table
while
at
work
in
producing
phenomena
he
had
visited
his
friend
seymour
kirkup
had
found
the
old
man
assisting
at
the
trance
of
a
peasant
girl
named
mariana
and
when
kirkup
withdrew
for
a
moment
the
entranced
mariana
relieved
herself
from
the
fatigue
of
her
posturing
at
the
same
time
inviting
browning
with
a
wink
to
be
a
charitable
confederate
in
the
joke
by
which
she
profited
in
admiration
and
in
pelf
browning
who
would
have
waged
immitigable
war
against
the
london
and
opposed
all
treaty
with
such
rogues
even
at
the
cost
of
an
unrecovered
flush
could
not
but
oppose
the
new
trade
of
elaborate
deception
but
his
feeling
was
intensified
by
the
personal
repulsiveness
of
the
professional
medium
the
vain
sleek
vulgar
emasculated
neurotic
type
of
creature
who
became
the
petted
oracle
of
the
room
was
loathsome
in
his
eyes
and
his
respect
for
his
wife
genius
made
him
feel
that
there
was
a
certain
desecration
in
the
neighbourhood
to
her
of
men
whom
he
regarded
as
verminous
impostors
yet
he
recognised
her
right
to
think
for
herself
and
she
on
the
other
hand
regarded
his
scepticism
as
rather
his
misfortune
than
his
crime
it
was
a
considerable
time
after
his
wife
death
that
browning
study
of
the
impostor
of
the
spiritualist
circles
mr
sludge
the
medium
appeared
in
the
of
the
date
of
its
composition
is
rome
but
the
observations
which
that
study
sums
up
were
accumulated
during
earlier
years
and
if
mr
sludge
is
not
a
portrait
of
home
that
eminent
member
of
the
tribe
of
sludge
no
doubt
supplied
suggestions
for
the
poet
browning
evidently
wrote
the
poem
with
a
peculiar
zest
its
intellectual
energy
never
flags
its
imaginative
grip
never
slackens
if
the
bishop
who
orders
his
tomb
at
st
praxed
serves
to
represent
the
sensuous
glory
and
the
moral
void
of
one
phase
of
the
italian
renaissance
so
and
with
equal
fidelity
does
mr
sludge
represent
a
phase
of
nineteenth
century
materialism
and
moral
grossness
which
can
not
extinguish
the
cravings
of
the
soul
but
would
vulgarise
and
degrade
them
with
coarse
illusions
unhappily
the
later
poem
differs
from
the
earlier
in
being
uglier
in
its
theme
and
of
inordinate
length
browning
somewhat
in
the
manner
of
ben
jonson
when
he
wrote
could
not
be
satisfied
until
he
had
exhausted
the
subject
to
the
dregs
the
writer
zeal
from
first
to
last
knows
no
abatement
but
it
is
not
every
reader
who
cares
to
bend
over
the
with
its
sick
effluvia
during
so
prolonged
a
demonstration
mr
sludge
the
medium
is
not
a
mere
attack
on
spiritualism
it
is
a
dramatic
scene
in
the
history
of
a
soul
and
browning
with
his
democratic
feeling
in
things
of
the
mind
held
that
every
soul
however
mean
is
worth
understanding
if
the
poem
is
a
satire
it
is
so
only
in
a
way
that
is
inevitable
browning
desire
is
to
be
absolutely
just
but
sometimes
truth
itself
becomes
perforce
a
satire
he
takes
an
impostor
at
the
moment
of
extreme
disadvantage
the
medium
is
caught
in
the
very
act
of
cheating
he
will
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
his
confession
is
made
as
nearly
as
possible
a
vindication
the
most
contemptible
of
creatures
in
desperate
straits
makes
excellent
play
with
targe
and
dagger
the
poetry
of
the
piece
is
to
be
found
in
the
lithe
attitudes
absolutely
the
best
possible
under
the
circumstances
by
which
he
maintains
both
defence
and
attack
half
of
the
long
is
a
criticism
not
of
those
who
feast
fools
in
their
folly
but
of
the
fools
who
require
a
caterer
for
the
feast
it
is
a
study
of
the
methods
by
which
dupes
solicit
and
educate
a
knave
the
other
half
is
sludge
plea
that
knave
though
he
be
he
is
not
wholly
knave
and
browning
while
absolutely
rejecting
the
doctrine
of
so
called
spiritualism
is
prepared
to
admit
that
in
the
composition
of
a
sludge
there
enters
a
certain
portion
of
truth
low
in
degree
perverted
in
kind
inoperative
to
the
ends
of
truth
yet
a
fragment
of
that
without
which
life
itself
were
impossible
even
for
the
meanest
organism
in
the
shape
of
man
cowardly
cunning
insolent
greedy
effeminately
sensual
playing
upon
the
vanity
of
his
patrons
playing
upon
their
vulgar
sentimentality
playing
upon
their
vulgar
pietisms
and
their
vulgar
materialism
sludge
after
all
is
less
the
wronger
than
the
wronged
who
made
him
what
he
is
who
keen
and
enough
in
fields
which
they
had
not
selected
as
their
special
for
trained
him
on
to
knavery
and
who
helped
him
through
his
blunders
with
ingenious
excuses
the
manifestations
are
at
first
so
weak
or
sludge
is
himself
disturbed
by
the
strange
phenomena
or
a
doubter
is
in
the
company
and
the
spirits
have
grown
confused
in
their
communications
who
proceeded
to
exhibit
him
as
a
lawful
prize
and
possession
staking
their
vanity
on
the
success
of
his
imposture
who
awakened
in
him
the
artist
joy
in
rare
invention
who
urged
him
forward
from
modest
to
magnificent
lies
who
fed
and
flattered
him
what
ladies
bestowed
their
soft
caresses
on
sludge
and
now
and
again
in
his
course
of
fraud
did
he
not
turn
a
wistful
eye
towards
any
reckless
tatterdemalion
if
only
the
vagrant
lived
in
freedom
and
in
truth
it
too
bad
i
say
ruining
a
soul
so
and
in
the
midst
of
gulls
who
persistently
refuse
to
be
undeceived
cheating
is
so
cruel
easy
the
difficulty
is
rather
that
the
cheating
even
when
acknowledged
should
ever
be
credited
for
what
it
is
the
medium
has
confessed
yes
and
to
cheat
may
be
part
of
the
medium
nature
none
the
less
he
has
the
medium
gift
of
acting
as
a
conductor
between
the
visible
and
the
invisible
worlds
has
he
not
told
secrets
of
the
lives
of
his
wondering
clients
which
could
not
have
been
known
by
natural
means
and
sludge
chuckles
could
not
could
not
be
known
by
him
who
in
his
seeming
passivity
is
alive
at
every
nerve
with
the
instinct
of
the
detective
by
him
whose
trade
was
throwing
thus
his
sense
out
like
an
long
tongue
soft
innocent
warm
moist
impassible
and
when
was
crusted
with

slick
their

enriched
his
palate
could
not
sludge
haunters
of
the
s√©ance
of
every
species
are
his
aiders
and
abettors
the
unbeliever
whom
believers
overwhelm
or
bribe
to
acquiescence
the
fair
votaries
who
find
prurient
suggestions
characteristic
of
the
genuine
medium
the
lover
of
the
lie
through
the
natural
love
of
it
the
amateur
incapable
of
a
real
conviction
who
plays
safely
with
superstition
the
literary
man
who
welcomes
a
new
flavour
for
the
narrative
or
the
novel
the
philosophic
who
wants
the
of
a
disputable
doctrine
on
which
to
try
the
edge
of
his
faculty

it
his
part
sludge
asks
indignantly
to
be
grateful
to
the

who
have
corrupted
and
debased
him
gratitude
to
these
the
gratitude
forsooth
of

the
truculence
of

is
not
without
warrant
it
is
indeed
no
other
than
the
truculence
of
robert
browning
shaking
his
mane
as
dante
rossetti
described
him
in
his
outbreaks
against
the
spiritualists
with
occasional
foamings
at
the
mouth
where
then
is
the
little
grain
of
truth
which
has
vitality
amid
the
putrefaction
of
sludge
nature
liar
and
cheat
as
he
is
he
can
not
be
sure
but
there
was
something
in
it
tricks
and
all
the
spiritual
world
he
feels
is
as
real
as
the
material
world
the
supernatural
interpenetrates
the
natural
at
every
point
in
little
things
as
in
great
things
god
is
present
sludge
is
aware
of
the
invisible
powers
at
every
nerve
i
guess
what
going
on
outside
the
veil
just
as
the
prisoned
crane
feels
in
the
islands
where
his
kind
are
so
must
fall
to
capering
by
himself
some
shiny
night
as
if
your
back
yard
were
a
plot
of
spice
he
cheats
yes
but
he
also
apprehends
a
truth
which
the
world
is
blind
to
or
after
all
is
this
cheating
when
every
lie
is
quick
with
a
germ
of
truth
is
not
such
lying
as
this
a
if
you
will
but
still
more
a
strange
sweet
in
the
service
of
truth
at
the
lowest
is
it
not
required
by
the
very
conditions
of
our
poor
mortal
life
which
remains
so
sorry
a
thing
so
imperfect
so
unendurable
until
it
is
brought
into
fruitful
connection
with
a
future
existence
this
world
of
ours
is
a
cruel
blundering
unintelligible
world
but
let
it
be
pervaded
by
an
influx
from
the
next
world
how
quickly
it
rights
itself
how
intelligible
it
all
grows
and
is
the
faculty
of
imagination
the
faculty
which
discovers
the
things
of
the
spirit
put
to
his
own
uses
by
the
poet
and
even
the
historian
is
this
a
power
which
cheats
its
possessor
or
cheats
those
for
whose
advantage
he
gives
it
play
browning
design
is
to
exhibit
even
in
this
sludge
the
rudiments
coarse
perverted
abnormally
directed
and
ineffective
for
moral
good
of
that
sublime
spiritual
wisdom
which
turned
to
its
proper
ends
and
aided
by
the
highest
intellectual
powers
is
present
to
take
a
lofty
exemplar
in
his
pope
of
ring
and
the
it
is
not
through
spiritualism
that
sludge
has
received
his
little
grain
of
truth
that
has
only
darkened
the
glimmer
of
true
light
which
was
in
him
yet
liar
and
cheat
and
coward
he
is
saved
from
a
purely
phantasmal
existence
by
this
fibre
of
reality
which
was
part
of
his
original
structure
the
epilogue
sludge
outbreak
against
his
corrupter
and
tormentor
stands
as
evidence
of
the
fact
that
no
purifying
no
cleansing
no
really
illuminating
power
remains
in
what
is
now
only
a
putrescent
luminosity
within
him
his
rage
is
natural
and
dramatically
true
a
noble
rage
would
be
to
his
honour
this
is
a
base
and
poisonous
passion
with
no
virtue
in
it
and
the
passion
flaring

idly

they
had
spent
the

season
four
years
previously
at
the
baths
of
lucca
their
house
among
the
hills
was
shut
in
by
a

in

by

the

time

worked
at
his
and
of
which
his
wife
was
able
to
report
in
the
autumn
that
it
was
in
an
advanced
state
a
was
the
most
important
achievement
of
the
summer
the
scene
of
the
declaration
in
the
mrs

informs

was
laid
in
a
little
adjacent
to
which
browning
walked
or
rode
only
a
few
weeks
were
given
to
florence
in
perfect
autumnal
weather
the
occupants
of
casa
guidi
started
for
rome
the
delightful
journey
occupied
eight
days
and
on
the
way
the
church
of
assisi
was
seen
and
the
falls
of
terni
that
passion
of
the
waters
so
mrs
browning
describes
it
which
makes
the
human
heart
seem
so
still
they
entered
rome
in
a
radiant
robert
and
penini
singing
an
apartment
had
been
taken
for
them
by
their
friends
the
storys
in
the
via
bocca
di
leone
and
all
was
bright
warm
and
full
of
comfort
next
morning
a
shadow
fell
upon
their
happiness
the
storys
little
boy
was
seized
with
convulsions
in
the
evening
he
was
dead
a
second
child
a
girl
was
taken
ill
in
the
brownings
house
and
could
not
be
moved
from
where
she
lay
in
a
room
below
their
apartment
mrs
browning
was
in
a
panic
for
her
own
boy
though
his
cheeks
spoke
of
health
rome
for
a
time
was
darkened
with
grief
and
anxiety
nor
did
the
city
itself
impress
her
as
she
had
expected
it

of

of

a
rash
act
of
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
he
entered
rome
had
deplorably
altered
browning
appearance
in
what
his
wife
calls
a
fit
of
suicidal
impatience
he
perpetrated
the
high
crime
and
misdemeanour
and
appeared
before
her
wholly
unworthy
of
portraiture
with
cheeks
and
chin
i
cried
when
i
saw
him
she
tells
his
sister
i
was
so
to
mark
the
sin
his
beard
when
once
again
he
recovered
his
good
looks
was
gray
but
mrs
browning
cherished
the
opinion
that
the
argentine
touch
as
she
terms
it
gave
a
character
of
elevation
and
thought
to
his
whole
physiognomy
to
complete
this
history
it
may
be
added
that
in
the
moustache
of
his
later
portraits
was
first
doubtfully
permitted
and
was
presently
approved
with
decision
as
picturesque
under
all
disadvantages
of
appearance
browning
made
his
way
triumphantly
in
the
english
and
american
society
of

the

towards
the
end
of

farewells
were
said
and
the
brownings
returned
from
rome
to
florence
by
vettura
they
had
hoped
to
visit
england
or
if
this
should
prove
impracticable
to
take
shelter
among
the
mountains
from
the
summer
heat
but
needful
coin
on
which
they
had
reckoned
did
not
arrive
and
they
resolved
in
prudence
to
sit
still
at
florence
and
eat
their
bread
and
macaroni
as
poor
sensible
folk
should
do
and
florence
looked
more
beautiful
than
ever
after
rome
the
nightingales
sang
around
the
and
vineyards
not
only
by
starlight
and
but
in
the
daytime
i
love
the
very
stones
of
florence
exclaims
mrs
browning
her
friend
miss
mitford
now
in
england
and
sadly
failing
in
health
hinted
at
a
loan
of
money
but
the
answer
was
a
prompt
oh
no
my
husband
has
a
family
likeness
to
lucifer
in
being
proud
there
followed
a
tranquil
and
a
happy
time
and
both
and
and
maintained
in
the
writers
a
deep
inward
excitement
of
the
kind
that

which

connected
in

early
weeks
of
mrs
browning
was
seriously
ill
through
feverish
nights
of
coughing
she
had
in
her
husband
a
devoted
nurse
his
sleepless
hours
were
troubled
not
only
by
anxiety
on
her
account
but
by
a
passionate
interest
in
the
heroisms
and
miseries
of
his
fellow
countrymen

crimean

he

not
until

did
she

once
more
a
leap
into

browning
was
now
actively
at
work
in
anticipation
of

his

the
approaching

particularly
in

but
the
weather
was
drooping
the
skies
misty
the

oppressive
and
mrs
browning
apart
from
these
had
special
causes
of
depression
her
married
sister
henrietta
was
away
in
taunton
and
the
cost
of
travel
prevented
the
sisters
from
meeting
arabella
barrett
my
one
light
in
london
is
mrs
browning
word
was
too
soon
obliged
to
depart
to
eastbourne
and
the
barrett
household
was
disturbed
by
the
undutifulness
of
a
son
who
had
been
guilty
of
the
unpardonable
crime
of
marriage
and
in
consequence
was
now
exiled
from
wimpole
street
in
body
and
soul
mrs
browning
felt
strong
yearnings
for
the
calm
of
casa
guidi
the
year
was
a
fortunate
year
for
english
poetry
and
was
published
in
the
autumn
the
beautiful
epilogue
addressed
to
there
they
are
my
fifty
men
and
women
was
written
in
dorset
street
tennyson
had
preceded
browning
volumes
by
some
months
it
bewildered
the
critics
but
his
brother
poet
did
justice
to
tennyson
passionate
sequence
of
dramatic
lyrics
and
though
london
in
had
emptied
itself
tennyson
happened
for
a
few
days
to
be
in
town
two
evenings
he
gave
to
the
brownings
dined
with
us
writes
mrs
browning
smoked
with
us
opened
his
heart
to
us
and
the
second
bottle
of
port
and
ended
by
reading
through
from
end
to
end
and
going
away
at
two
in
the
morning
his
delightful
frankness
and
simplicity
charmed
his
hostess
think
of
his
stopping
in
she
goes
on
every
now
and
then
a
wonderful
touch
that
very
tender
how
beautiful
that
is
yes
and
it
wonderful
tender
beautiful
and
he
read
exquisitely
in
a
voice
like
an
organ
rather
music
than
speech
one
of
the
few
persons
who
were
invited
to
meet
tennyson
on
this
occasion
mr
rossetti
is
still
living
and
his
record
of
that
memorable
evening
ought
not
to
be
omitted
the
audience
was
a
small
one
the
privilege
accorded
to
each
individual
all
the
higher
mr
and
mrs
browning
miss
browning
my
brother
and
myself
and
i
think
there
was
one
more
either
madox
brown
or
else
holman
hunt
or
woolner
tennyson
seated
on
a
sofa
in
a
characteristic
attitude
and
holding
the
volume
near
his
eyes
read
right
through
my
brother
made
two
sketches
of
him
and
gave
one
of
them
to
browning
so
far
as
i
remember
the
neither
saw
what
dante
was
doing
nor
knew
of
it
afterwards
his
deep
grand
voice
with
slightly
chaunting
intonation
was
a
noble
vehicle
for
the
perusal
of
mighty
verse
on
it
rolled
sonorous
and
emotional
dante
rossetti
according
to
mr
hall
caine
spoke
of
the
incident
in
these
terms
once
heard
tennyson
read
and
whilst
the
fiery
passages
were
delivered
with
a
voice
and
vehemence
which
he
alone
of
living
men
can
compass
the
softer
passages
and
the
songs
made
the
tears
course
down
his
cheeks
after
tennyson
and
came
browning
and
lippo
read
with
as
much
sprightly
variation
as
there
was
in
tennyson
of
sustained
continuity
truly
a
night
of
the
gods
not
to
be
remembered
without
pride
and
pang
a
quotation
from
a
letter
of
dante
rossetti
to
allingham
gives
praise
to
mrs
browning
of
a
kind
which
resembles
lockhart
commendation
of
her
husband
what
a
delightful
unliterary
person
mrs
browning
is
to
meet
during
two
evenings
when
tennyson
was
at
their
house
in
london
mrs
browning
left
tennyson
with
her
husband
and
william
and
me
who
were
the
fortunate
remnant
of
the
male
party
to
discuss
the
universe
and
gave
all
her
attention
to
some
certainly
not
very
exciting
ladies
in
the
next
room
without
detracting
from
mrs
browning
unliterary
merits
one
may
conjecture
that
the
ladies
who
proved
unexciting
to
rossetti
were
arabella
barrett
and
sarianna

compelled
me
rossetti
adds
to
sit
down
before
him
and
lay
siege
for
one
whole
night
the
result
of
which
was
that
he
sent
me
next
morning
a
bulky
letter
to
be
forwarded
to
browning
in
which
i
trust
he
told
him
he
was
the
greatest
man
since
shakespeare
the
poems
of
the
two
new
volumes
were
the
gradual
growth
of
a
considerable
number
of
years
since
their
author
had
published
no
group
of
short
poems
and
now
at
the
age
of
he
had
attained
the
fulness
of
intellectual
and
imaginative
power
varied
experience
of
life
and
the
artistic
culture
of
italy
the
of
exhibits
no
decline
from
the
high
level
reached
in
the
volumes
of
but
is
there
any
later
volume
of
miscellaneous
poetry
by
browning
which
taken
as
a
whole
approaches
in
excellence
the
collections
of
and
there
is
no
need
now
to
lay
siege
to
the
poems
of
and
they
have
expounded
themselves
if
ever
they
needed
exposition
and
the
truth
is
that
they
are
by
no
means
into
which
mottoes
meant
for
the
construing
of
the
intellect
have
been
inserted
but
fruits
rich
in
colour
and
perfume
a
feast
for
the
imagination
the
passions
the
spirit
in
sense
and
also
for
the
faculty
of
thought
which
lives
in
the
heart
of
these
if
a
criticism
or
a
doctrine
of
life
lies
in
them
and
that
it
should
do
so
means
that
the
poet
total
mind
has
been
taken
up
into
his
art
browning
conveys
his
doctrine
not
as
such
but
as
an
enthusiasm
of
living
his
generalized
truth
saturates
a
medium
of
passion
and
of
beauty
in
the
prologue
to
at
the
he
compares
the
joy
of
poetry
to
a
swimmer
joy
in
the
sea
the
vigour
that
such
disport
in
sun
and
sea
communicates
is
the
vigour
of
joyous
play
afterwards
if
we
please
we
can
ascertain
the
constituents
of
by
a
chemical
analysis
but
the
analysis
will
not
convey
to
us
the
sensations
of
the
sunshine
and
the
dancing
brine
one
of
the
pieces
of
and
rebukes
a
youthful
poet
of
the
transcendental
school
whose
ambition
is
to
set
forth
thought
in
poetry
why
take
the
harp
to
his
breast
only
to
speak
dry
words
across
the
strings
better
hollo
abstract
ideas
through
the
alpine
horn
of
prose
boys
may
desire
the
interpretation
into
bare
ideas
of
those
thronging
objects
which
obsess
their
senses
and
their
feelings
men
need
art
for
the
delight
of
it
and
the
strength
which
comes
through
delight
better
than
the
meaning
of
a
rose
is
the
rose
itself
with
its
spirit
enveloped
in
colour
and
perfume
and
so
the
poet
for
men
will
resemble
that
old
mage
john
of
halberstadt
he
with
a
you
vents
a
brace
of
rhymes
and
in
there
breaks
the
sudden
rose
herself
over
us
under
round
us
every
side
buries
us
with
a
glory
young
once
more
pouring
heaven
into
this
shut
house
of
life
browning
in
and
is
in
truth
a
john
of
halberstadt
he
enriches
life
with
colour
warmth
music
romance
not
dissociated
from
thought
and
intellectual
energy
rather
possessing
and
being
possessed
by
these
not
a
single
poem
is
thought
not
a
single
poem
is
addressed
solely
to
the
intellect
even
is
rather
a
presentation
of
character
than
a
train
of
argument
or
a
chain
of
ideas
in
few
of
these
poems
does
browning
speak
in
his
own
person
the
verses
addressed
to
his
wife
which
present
her
with
his
fifty
men
and
women
and
tell
of
mysteries
of
love
that
can
never
be
told
the
lines
addressed
to
one
who
had
seen
shelley
and
pictures
in
are
perhaps
the
only
exceptions
to
the
dramatic
character
of
the
contents
of
the
two
volumes
yet
through
them
all
browning
mind
is
clearly
discernible
and
even
his
central
convictions
his
working
creed
of
life
can
with
no
sense
of
uncertainty
be
gathered
from
them
to
attribute
to
the
writer
the
opinions
and
the
feelings
of
his
would
of
course
be
the
crudest
of
mistakes
but
when
an
idea
persists
through
many
poems
written
at
various
times
and
seasons
when
it
appears
and
reappears
under
various
clothings
of
circumstance
when
it
is
employed
as
if
it
had
a
crucial
value
when
it
becomes
a
test
or
touchstone
of
character
we
can
not
doubt
that
it
is
an
intimate
possession
of
the
writer
mind
such
an
idea
is
not
a
mere
playmate
but
rather
a
confidant
when
again
after
a
tangle
of
casuistic
reasoning
or
an
embroilment
of
contending
feelings
some
idea
suddenly
flashes
forth
and
like
a
sword
sunders
truth
from
falsehood
and
darkness
from
light
we
may
be
assured
that
it
has
more
than
a
dramatic
value
and
once
more
if
again
and
again
the
same
idea
shows
its
power
over
the
feelings
and
inspires
elevated
lyrical
utterance
or
if
in
pieces
of
casuistical
it
enters
as
a
passionate
element
and
domineers
by
its
own
authority
if
it
originates
not
debate
but
song
or
that
from
which
song
is
made
we
know
that
the
writer
heart
has
embraced
it
as
a
truth
of
the
emotions
because
browning
had
his
own
view
of
truth
he
could
confidently
lend
his
mind
away
to
his
fifty
or
his
hundred
men
and
women
they
served
to
give
his
ideas
a
concrete
body
by
sympathy
and
by
intelligence
he
widened
the
basis
of
his
own
existence
if
the
poet
loses
himself
to
find
himself
again
through
sympathy
with
external
nature
how
much
more
and
in
how
many
enriching
ways
through
sympathy
with
humanity
thus
new
combinations
of
thought
and
feeling
are
effected
thus
a
kind
of
experiment
is
made
with
our
own
ideas
by
watching
how
they
behave
when
brought
into
connection
with
these
new
combinations
truth
is
relative
and
the
best
truth
of
our
own
is
worth
testing
under
various
conditions
and
circumstances
the
truth
or
falsehood
which
is
not
our
own
has
a
right
to
say
the
best
for
itself
that
can
be
said
let
truth
and
falsehood
grapple
let
us
hear
the
or
the
rival
falsehood
which
is
the
complement
or
the
criticism
of
our
own
and
hear
it
stated
with
the
utmost
skill
a
luther
would
surely
be
the
wiser
for
an
evening
spent
in
company
with
a
blougram
and
blougram
has
things
to
tell
us
which
luther
never
knew
but
precisely
because
truth
is
relative
we
must
finally
adhere
to
our
own
perceptions
they
constitute
the
light
for
us
and
the
justice
we
would
do
to
others
we
must
also
render
to
ourselves
a
wide
survey
may
be
made
from
a
fixed
centre
universal
sympathies
miss
barrett
wrote
in
one
of
the
letters
to
her
future
husband
can
not
make
a
man
inconsistent
but
on
the
contrary
sublimely
consistent
a
church
tower
may
stand
between
the
mountains
and
the
sea
looking
to
either
and
stand
fast
but
the
willow
tree
at
the
blown
now
toward
the
north
and
now
toward
the
south
while
its
natural
leaning
is
due
east
or
west
is
different
altogether
different
as
a
willow
tree
from
a
church
tower
the
fifty
poems
of
and
with
a
few
exceptions
fall
into
three
principal
groups
those
which
interpret
various
careers
or
moods
or
moments
of
love
those
which
deal
with
the
fine
arts
painting
poetry
music
and
with
these
we
may
class
as
kindred
in
spirit
that
poem
which
has
for
its
subject
the
passionate
pursuit
of
knowledge
grammarian
and
thirdly
those
which
are
connected
with
religious
thought
and
feeling
or
present
scenes
from
the
history
of
religions
two
poems
may
be
called
descriptive
both
are
italian
both
are
founded
upon
a
rivalry
of
contrasts
but
one
at
a
villa
down
in
the
is
made
up
of
humorous
observations
of
italian
city
and
country
life
expressing
the
mundane
tastes
and
prudent
economies
of
an
italian
person
of
quality
the
other
which
contrasts
the
happy
quietudes
of
english
landscape
with
the
passionate
landscape
of
the
south
has
romance
at
the
heart
of
its
realism
and
an
ardour
of
sentiment
underlying
its
pictorial
vividness
is
again
italian
suggested
perhaps
by
the
swift
revolutions
and
restorations
which
browning
had
witnessed
in
florence
and
again
it
uses
with
striking
effect
the
principle
of
contrast
the
patriot
who
a
year
ago
had
his
intoxicating
triumph
is
now
on
his
way
to
the
scaffold
his
year
toil
for
the
good
of
his
people
has
turned
into
a
misdeeds
his
life
is
a
failure
but
browning
characteristically
wrings
a
victory
out
of
defeat
the
crowd
at
the
shambles
gate
may
hoot
it
is
better
so
for
now
the
martyr
can
throw
himself
upon
god
the
paymaster
of
all
his
labourers
at
the
close
of
day
the
most
remarkable
of
these
poems
which
refuse
to
take
their
places
in
a
group
is
that
forlorn
romance
of
weary
and
depressed
heroism
roland
to
the
dark
tower
it
is
in
the
main
a
fantaisie
of
description
but
involved
with
the
descriptive
study
is
a
romantic
motive
the
external
suggestions
for
the
poem
were
no
more
than
the
words
from
which
form
the
title
a
tower
seen
in
the
carrara
mountains
a
painting
seen
in
paris
and
the
figure
of
a
horse
in
the
tapestry
of
the
of
casa
guidi
in
his
own
mind
browning
may
have
put
the
question
of
all
the
feats
of
which
is
the
hardest
not
to
combat
with
dragons
or
robbers
or
salvage
men
not
to
bear
down
rival
champions
in
a
rapture
of
battle
not
these
but
to
cling
to
a
purpose
amid
all
that
depresses
the
senses
at
a
time
when
the
heart
within
us
is
also
failing
to
advance
where
there
is
nothing
to
arouse
energy
by
opposition
and
everything
without
and
within
to
sap
the
very
life
of
the
soul
childe
roland
is
himself
hopeless
and
almost
heartless
the
plain
to
which
the
leering
cripple
had
pointed
and
over
which
he
rides
is
created
in
the
utter
indigence
of
nature
a
very
nightmare
of
poverty
and
mean
repulsiveness
and
yet
he
endures
the
test
and
halts
only
when
he
faces
the
dark
tower
and
blows
the
blast
upon
his
horn
browning
was
wise
to
carry
his
romance
no
further
the
one
moment
of
action
is
enough
it
is
the
breaking
of
the
spell
the
waking
from
the
nightmare
and
at
that
point
the
quester
may
be
left
we
are
defrauded
of
nothing
by
the
abrupt
conclusion
in
the
poems
which
treat
of
the
love
of
man
and
woman
browning
regards
the
union
of
soul
with
soul
as
the
capital
achievement
of
life
and
also
as
affording
one
of
its
chief
tests
when
we
have
formed
these
into
a
group
we
perceive
that
the
group
falls
in
the
main
into
two
divisions
poems
which
tell
of
attainment
and
poems
which
tell
of
failure
or
defeat
certain
persons
whose
centre
is
a
little
hard
kernel
of
egoism
may
be
wholly
disqualified
for
the
test
created
by
a
generous
passion
browning
does
not
belabour
with
heavy
invective
the
of
his
poem
who
is
born
without
a
heart
she
is
a
creature
and
of
her
kind
is
perfect
only
the
flower
is
to
be
gazed
at
not
gathered
or
if
it
must
be
gathered
then
at
last
to
be
thrown
away
the
chief
distinction
between
the
love
of
man
and
the
love
of
woman
implied
in
various
poems
is
this
the
man
at
his
most
blissful
moment
cries
what
treasures
i
have
obtained
the
woman
cries
what
treasures
have
i
to
surrender
and
bestow
hence
the
singleness
and
finality
in
the
election
of
passion
made
by
a
woman
as
compared
with
a
man
acquisitiveness
of
delight
the
unequal
exchange
of
a
transitory
for
an
enduring
surrender
of
self
is
the
sorrow
which
pulsates
through
the
lines
of
a
as
swift
and
broken
with
pauses
as
the
beating
of
a
heart
dear
the
pang

of

this
is
the
point
of
central

in

poem
of
exquisite
and
pathetic

and
admiration

but

browning
does
justice
to
the
pure
chivalry
of
a
man
devotion
caponsacchi
joy
is
the
joy
of
a
saviour
who
himself
is
saved
the
great
event
of
his
life
by
which
he
is
lifted
above
self
is
single
and
ultimate
his
soul
is
delivered
from
careless
egoism
once
and
for
ever
the
grace
of

is
here
what
the
theologians
called
invincible
grace
and
invincible
grace
we
know
results
in
final
perseverance
even
here
in
and
two
contrasted
poems
assure
us
that
while
the
passion
of
a
man
may
be
no
more
than
in
a
it
may
also
be
an
unweariable
in
a
of
the
poems
of
attainment
one
has
the
spirit
of
youth
and
gaiety
in
it
here
love
makes
its
gallant
bid
for
freedom
fires
up
for
lawlessness

need
be
and
at

sets

at
defiance

eh
down

but
after
all
this
love
may
be
no
more
than
an
adventure
of
the
boulevard
and
the
attic
in
the
manner
of
b√©ranger
gay
bohemianism
the
distance
is
wide
between
such
√©lan
of
youthful
passion
and
the
fidelity
which
is
inevitable
and
on
which
age
has
set
its
seal
in
that
poem
of
perfect
attainment
the
this
is
the
love
which
completes
the
individual
life
and
at
the
same
time
incorporates
it
with
the
life
of
humanity
which
unites
as
one
the
past
and
the
present
and
which
owing
no
allegiance
of
a
servile
kind
to
time
becomes
a
pledge
for
futurity
browning
personal
experience
is
here
taken
up
into
his
imagination
and
transfigured
but
its
substance
remains
what
it
had
been
in
literal
fact
the
poems
of
failure
are
more
numerous
and
they
range
through
various
degrees
and
kinds
of
failure
it
is
not
death
which
can
bring
the
sense
of
failure
to
love
in
all
the
passion
has
been
on
the
man
side
all
possibilities
of
love
in
the
virginal
heart
of
the
dead
girl
all
her
warmth
and
sweetness
had
been
folded
in
the
bud
but
death
in
the
mood
of
infinite
tenderness
and
unfulfilled
aspiration
which
the
poem
expresses
seems
no
bar
to
some
attainment
of
which
the
speaker
passion
breaking
through
time
is
the
assurance
an
attainment
the
nature
of
which
he
can
not
divine
but
which
will
surely
explain
the
meaning
of
things
that
are
now
obscure
perhaps
the
saddest
and
the
most
hopeless
kind
of
failure
is
that
in
which
to
borrow
an
image
from
the
old
allegory
the
arrow
of
love
all
but
flies
to
the
mark
and
yet
just
misses
it
this
is
the
subject
of
a
poem
equally
admirable
in
its
descriptive
and
its
emotional
passages
in
the
the
line
one
near
one
is
too
far
might
serve
as
its
motto
satisfaction
is
all
but
reached
and
never
can
be
reached
two
hearts
touch
and
never
can
unite
one
drop
of
the
salt
estranging
sea
is
as
unplumbed
as
the
whole
ocean
and
the
only
possible
end
is
infinite
passion
and
the
pain
of
finite
hearts
that
yearn
compared
with
such
a
failure
as
this
an
offer
of
love
rejected
rejected
with
decision
but
not
ungenerously
may
be
accounted
a
success
there
is
something
tonic
to
a
brave
heart
in
the
putting
forth
of
will
even
though
it
encounter
an
obstacle
which
can
not
be
removed
such
is
the
mood
which
is
presented
in
way
of
the
foiled
lover
has
at
least
made
his
supreme
effort
it
has
been
fruitless
but
he
thinks
with
satisfaction
that
he
has
played
boldly
for
the
prize
and
never
can
he
say
that
it
was
not
worth
risking
all
on
the
bare
chance
of
success
she
will
not
give
me
heaven
is
well
lose
who
may
i
still
can
say
those
who
win
heaven
blest
are
they
so
too
in
last
ride
the
lover
is
defeated
but
he
is
not
cast
down
and
he
remains
magnanimous
throughout
the
grief
of
defeat
who
in
this
our
life
he
reflects
statesman
or
soldier
sculptor
or
poet
attains
his
complete
ideal
he
has
been
granted
the
grace
of
one
hour
by
his
mistress
side
and
he
will
carry
the
grateful
recollection
of
this
with
him
into
the
future
as
his
inalienable
and
his
best
possession
with
these
generous
rejections
and
magnanimous
acceptances
of
failure
stands
in
contrast
serenade
at
the
where
the
lover
devotion
is
met
only
by
obdurate
insensibility
or
worse
by
an
irritated
sense
of
the
persecution
and
plague
of
such
love
and
where
all
things
seem
to
conspire
to
leave
his
pain
mere
pain
bitter
and
unredeemed
in
these
examples
though
love
has
been
frustrated
in
its
aim
the
cause
of
failure
did
not
lie
in
any
infirmity
of
the
lover
heart
or
will
but
what
if
the
will
itself
be
supine
what
if
it
dallies
and
delays
consults
the
convenience
of
occasions
observes
the
indications
of
a
shallow
prudence
slackens
its
pace
towards
the
goal
and
meanwhile
the
passion
languishes
and
grows
pale
from
day
to
day
until
the
day
of
love
has
waned
and
the
passion
dies
in
a
twilight
hour
through
mere
inanition
such
a
failure
as
this
seems
to
browning
to
mean
the
perishing
of
a
soul
or
of
more
souls
than
one
he
takes
in
statue
and
the
a
case
where
the
fulfilment
of
passion
would
have
been
a
crime
the
lady
is
a
bride
of
the
riccardi
to
win
her
now
a
wedded
wife
would
be
to
violate
the
law
of
god
and
man
nevertheless
it
is
her
face
which
has
filled
the
empty
sheath
of
a
man
with
a
blade
for
a
knight
adventure
the
duke
grew
straightway
brave
and
wise
and
then
follow
delays
of
convenience
excuses
postponements
and
the
duke
flood
of
passion
dwindles
to
a
thread
and
is
lost
in
the
sandy
flats
of
life
so
weeks
grew
months
years
gleam
by
gleam
the
glory
dropped
from
their
youth
and
love
and
both
perceived
they
had
dreamed
a
dream
their
end
was
a
crime
but
browning
contention
is
that
a
crime
may
serve
for
a
test
as
well
as
a
virtue
in
that
test
the
duke
and
the
lady
had
alike
failed
through
mere
languor
of
soul
and
the
sin
i
impute
to
each
frustrate
ghost
is
the
unlit
lamp
and
the
ungirt
loin
though
the
end
in
sight
was
a
vice
i
say
had
tennyson
treated
the
same
subject
he
would
probably
have
glorified
their
action
as
a
victorious
obedience
to
the
law
of
and
the
reunion
and
the
severance
of
lovers
are
presented
in
three
poems
winter
chill
without
but
warm
within
with
its
pastimes
of
passion
the
energies
of
joy
breaking
forth
in
play
is
contrasted
in
with
springtime
all
gladness
without
and
a
strange
void
and
shiver
at
the
heart
of
things
because
alienation
has
taken
the
place
of
camaraderie
between
the
lover
and
his
mistress
the
mass
and
intensity
of
colour
in
the
stanza
which
dashes
in
a
sketch
of
the
pampas
with
its
leagues
of
sunflowers
and
a
wild
horse
black
neck
and
eyeballs
keen
appearing
through
them
almost
afflict
the
reader
sense
of
sight
there
is
a
fine
irony
in
the
title
of
the
other
poem
of
contention
womans
last
in
a
quarrel
a
woman
will
have
the
last
word
and
here
it
is
the
need
of
quietude
for
a
little
while
that
she
may
recover
from
the
bewildering
stroke
of
pain
and
then
entire
oblivion
of
the
wrong
with
unmeasured
the
poem
of
union
among

is
constructed
in
a
triple
contrast
the
endless
pastures
prolonged
to
the
edge
of
sunset
with
their
infinity
of
calm
are
contrasted
with
the
vast
and
magnificent
animation
of
the
city
which
once
occupied
the
plain
and
the
mountain
slopes
the
lover
keeps
at
from
his
heart
and
brain
what
yet
fills
them
all
the
while
here
in
this
placid
is
one
vivid
point
of
intensest
life
here
where
once
were
the
grandeur
and
tumult
of
the
enormous
city
is
that
which
in
a
moment
can
abolish
for
the
lover
all
its
glories
and
its
shames
his
eager
anticipation
of
meeting
his
beloved
face
to
face
and
heart
to
heart
is
not
sung
after
the
manner
of
burns
as
a
jet
of
unmingled
joy
he
delays
his
rapture
to
make
its
arrival
more
entirely
rapturous
he
uses
his
imagination
to
check
and
to
enhance
his
passion
and
the
poem
though
not
a
simple
cry
of
the
heart

of

which

music
is
supposed
to
express
but
here
in
dealing
with
the
fugue
of
his
imaginary
german
composer
browning
finds
his
inspiration
not
in
the
sentiment
but
in
the
structure
of
the
composition
he
competes
as
it
were
in
language
with
the
art
or
science
of
the
contrapuntist
and
evolves

idea

venice
of
the
eighteenth
century
lives
before
us
with
its
mundane
joys
its
transitory
passions
its
voluptuous
hours

midst
of
its
warmth
and
colour

chill

senses

aloud
if
he
should
please
but
here
he
will
not

the
prophet
the
life
of
venice
is
dust
and
ashes
the
poet
will
say
not
a
word
more
than
the
musician

said
in
his
toccata
the
ruthlessness
of

him
a
little

is
enough
and
too
much
that

hours

evidences
of
the

of

most
ideal
of
the
arts
that
appeal
to
the
mind
through
the
eye
in
browning
poetry
and
his
sympathies
would
be
more
apt
to
respond
to
such
work
as
michael
angelo
which
sends
the
spectator
beyond
itself
than
to
the
classical
work
which
has
the
absoluteness
and
the
calm
of
attained
perfection
the
sensuous
and
the
spiritual
qualities
of
colour
were
vividly
felt
by
him
a
yellowing
old
marble
seemed
perhaps
to
impose
itself
with
a
cold
authority
upon
the
imagination
but
the
suggestion
of
two
portrait
busts
of
the
period
of
classical
decadence
one
in
marble
representing
a
boy
and
the
other
the
powerful
head
of
a
man
in
granite
gave
rise
to
one
of
the
few
flawless
poems
of
browning
his
mastery
over
the
rhymed
couplet
is
nowhere
seen
to
greater
advantage
unless
it
be
in
a
few
passages
of
the
poem
is
however
more
a
page
from
history
than
a
study
in
the
fine
arts
and
browning
imagination
has
made
it
a
page
which
lives
in
our
memory
through
a
pathos
veiled
under
strong
objective
touches
never
protruding
itself
sentimentally
in
quest
of
tenderness
or
pity
i
spent
some
most
delightful
time
rossetti
wrote
to
allingham
shortly
after
the
publication
of
and
with
browning
at
paris
both
in
the
evenings
and
at
the
louvre
where
and
throughout
conversation
i
found
his
knowledge
of
early
italian
art
beyond
that
of
any
one
i
ever
met
beyond
that
of
ruskin
himself
the
poem
pictures
at
which
rossetti
calls
a
jolly
thing
and
which
is
that
and
much
more
is
full
of
browning
learned
enthusiasm
for
the
early
italian
painters
and
it
gives
a
reason
for
the
strong
attraction
which
their
adventures
after
new
beauty
and
passion
had
for
him
as
compared
with
the
faultless
achievements
of
classical
sculpture
greek
art
according
to
browning
by
presenting
unattainable
ideals
of
material
and
mundane
perfection
taught
men
to
submit
early
christian
art
even
by
faultily
presenting
spiritual
ideals
not
to
be
attained
on
earth
but
to
be
pursued
through
an
immortal
life
taught
men
to
aspire
the
aim
of
these
painters
was
not
to
exhibit
strength
or
grace
joy
or
grief
rage
or
love
in
their
complete
earthly
attainment
but
rather
to
make
new
hopes
shine
through
the
flesh
they
fray
new
fears
aggrandize
the
rags
and
tatters
to
bring
the
invisible
full
into
play
let
the
visible
go
to
the
dogs
what
matters
illustration
andrea

sarto
a
print
after
the
portrait
by
himself
in
the
uffizi
gallery
the
prophecy
with
which
the
poem
concludes
of
a
great
revival
of
italian
art
consequent
on
the
advent
of
political
and
intellectual
liberty
has
not
obtained
fulfilment
in
the
course
of
the
half
century
that
has
elapsed
since
it
was
uttered
browning
doctrine
that
aspiration
towards
what
is
higher
is
more
to
be
valued
in
art
than
the
attainment
of
what
is
lower
is
a
leading
motive
in
the
admirable
dramatic
monologue
placed
in
the
lips
of
andrea
del
sarto
the
faultless
painter
his
craftsmanship
is
unerring
whatever
he
imagines
he
can
achieve
nothing
in
line
or
in
colour
is
other
than
it
ought
to
be
and
yet
precisely
because
he
has
succeeded
his
failure
is
profound
and
irretrievable
ah
but
a
man
reach
should
exceed
his
grasp
or
what
a
heaven
for
all
is
placid
and
perfect
with
my
art
the
worse
he
could
set
right
the
arm
which
is
wrongly
put
in
rafael
work
that
fronts
him
but
all
the
play
the
insight
and
the
stretch
of
rafael
are
lacking
in
his
own
faultless
lines
he
looks
back
regretfully
to
his
kingly
days
at
fontainebleau
with
the
royal
francis
when
what
seemed
a
veritable
fire
was
in
his
heart
and
he
tries
to
find
an
excuse
for
his
failure
as
artist
and
as
man
in
the
coldness
of
his
beautiful
lucrezia
for
he
who
has
failed
in
the
higher
art
has
also
failed
in
the
higher
love
lucrezia
who
values
his
work
only
by
the
coins
it
brings
in
and
who
needs
those
coins
just
now
for
one
whose
whistle
invites
her
away
all
might
be
so
much
better
otherwise
yet
otherwise
he
can
not
choose
that
it
should
be
his
art
must
remain
what
it
is
not
golden
but
and
his
lucrezia
may
attend
to
the
cousin
whistle
if
only
she
retains
the
charm
not
to
be
evaded
of
her
beauty
browning
does
not
mean
that
art
in
its
passionate
pursuit
of
the
highest
ends
should
be
indifferent
to
the
means
or
that
things
spiritual
do
not
require
as
adequate
a
sensuous
embodiment
as
they
are
capable
of
receiving
from
the
painter
brush
or
the
poet
pen
were
art
a
mere
symbol
or
suggestion
two
bits
of
sticks
nailed
crosswise
might
claim
to
be
art
as
admirable
as
any
what
is
the
eye
for
if
not
to
see
with
vivid
exactness
what
is
the
hand
for
if
not
to
fashion
things
as
nature
made
them
it
is
through
body
that
we
reach
after
the
soul
and
the
passion
for
truth
and
reality
is
a
passion
for
the
invisible
which
is
expressed
in
and
through
these
such
is
the
pleading
of
fra
lippo
lippi
the
tonsured
painter
caught
out
of
bounds
in
that
poem
in
which
the
dramatic
monologue
of
browning
attains
its
perfection
of
life
and
energy
fra
lippo
is
intoxicated
by
the
mere
forms
and
colours
of
things
and
he
is
assured
that
these
mean
intensely
and
mean
well
the
beauty
and
the
wonder
and
the
power
the
shapes
of
things
their
colours
lights
and
shades
changes
surprises
and
god
made
it
all
these
are
the
gospel
to
preach
which
he
girds
loin
and
lights
the
lamp
though
he
may
perforce
indulge
a
patron
in
shallower
pieties
of
the
conventional
order
and
though
it
is
not
all
gospel
with
him
for
now
and
again
when
the
moon
shines
and
girls
go
skipping
and
singing
down
florence
streets
zooks
sir
flesh
and
blood
that
all
i
made
of
fra
lippo
with
his
outbreaks
of
frank
sensuality
is
far
nearer
to
browning
kingdom
of
heaven
than
is
the
faultless
painter
he
presses
with
ardour
towards
his
proper
goal
in
art
he
has
full
faith
in
the
ideal
but
with
him
it
is
to
be
sought
only
through
the
real
or
rather
it
need
not
be
sought
at
all
for
one
who
captures
any
fragment
of
reality
captures
also
undesignedly
and
inevitably
its
divine
significance
the
same
doctrine
which
is
applied
to
art
in
pictures
in
that
high
aims
though
unattained
are
of
more
worth
than
a
lower
achievement
is
applied
and
with
a
fine
lyrical
enthusiasm
to
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
in
grammarian
the
time
is
shortly
after
the
revival
of
learning
in
europe
the
place
a
tall
mountain
citied
to
the
top
crowded
with
culture
is
imagined
to
suit
the
idea
of
the
poem
the
dead
scholar
borne
to
the
summit
for
burial
on
the
shoulders
of
his
disciples
had
been
possessed
by
the
aspiration
of
paracelsus
to
know
and
unlike
paracelsus
he
had
never
sought
on
earth
both
to
know
and
to
enjoy
he
has
been
the
saint
and
the
martyr
of
renaissance
philology
for
the
genius
of
such
a
writer
as
the
author
of
with
his
positive
intellect
and
dense
common
sense
there
could
hardly
have
been
found
a
fitter
object
for
mockery
than
this
remorseless
and
indefatigable
pedant
browning
through
the
singing
voices
of
the
dead
master
disciples
exalts
him
to
an
eminence
of
honour
and
splendid
fame
to
a
scholar
greek
particles
may
serve
as
the
fittest
test
of
virtue
this
glorious
pedant
has
postponed
life
and
the
enjoyments
of
life
to
future
cycles
of
existence
here
on
earth
he
expends
a
desperate
passion
upon
what
upon
the
dryasdust
intricacies
of
grammar
and
it
is
not
as
though
he
had
already
attained
he
only
desperately
follows
after
that
low
man
seeks
a
little
thing
to
do
sees
it
and
does
it
this
high
man
with
a
great
thing
to
pursue
dies
ere
he
knows
it
but
again
the
grammarian
like
the
painter
does
not
strive
after
a
vague
transcendental
ideal
he
is
not
as
one
that
beateth
the
air
his
quest
for
knowledge
is
definite
and
positive
enough
he
throws
all
care
for
infinite
things
except
the
infinite
of
philological
accuracy
upon
god
and
the
viaticum
of
his
last
moments
is
one
more
point
of
grammar
two
of
the
poems
of
and
are
pages
and
from
the
history
of
religion
in
heretic
s
john
master
of
the
temple
burns
alive
in
paris
square
for
his
sins
against
the
faith
and
holy
church
the
glow
of
the
blazing
larch
and
pine
almost
reaches
the
reader
of
the
stanzas
the
great
petals
of
this
red
rose
of
flame
bend
towards
him
the
gust
of
sulphur
offends
his
nostrils
and
the
rage
of
piety
is
hotter
than
the
fire
it
is
a
mingled
passion
compounded
of
delight
in
the
fierce
spectacle
a
thrilling
ecstacy
at
the
sight
of
a
tortured
the
of
conscious
orthodoxy
and
the
horrible
zeal
of
the
lord
house
yet
though
the
event
is
sung
by
one
of
the
rejoicing
orthodox
somehow
we
are
made
to
feel
that
when
john
the
apostate
bound
in
the
flames
and
gagged
prays
to
jesus
christ
to
save
him
that
prayer
may
have
been
answered
this
passage
from
the
story
of
the
age
of
faith
was
not
selected
with
a
view
to
please
the
mediaeval
revivalists
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
in
truth
its
chief
value
is
not
theological
or
historical
but
artistic
cross
a
second
fragment
from
history
does
not
fall
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
but
rises
from
the
ridiculous
to
the
sublime
the
picture
of
the
jews
tumbling
or
sidling
churchwards
to
hear
the
christian
sermon
for
he
saith
compel
them
to
come
in
and
to
partake
of
heavenly
grace
has
in
it
something
of
rembrandt
united
with
something
of
callot
such
a
crew
of
devout
impostors
is
at
once
comic
and
piteous
but
while
they
are
cared
for
in
the
merciful
bowels
of
the
church
and
groan
out
the
expected
compunction
their
ancient
piety
is
not
extinct
their
hearts
burn
in
them
with
the
memory
of
jacob
house
and
of
jerusalem
christ
at
least
was
of
their
kindred
and
if
they
wronged
him
in
past
time
they
will
not
wrong
him
now
by
naming
these
who
outrage
and
insult
them
after
his
name
the
historical
distortions
of
the
religion
of
christ
do
not
however
disturb
the
faith
of
browning
in
the
christian
revelation
of
divine
love
in
he
exhibits
the
failure
of
paganism
even
in
its
forms
of
highest
culture
to
solve
the
riddle
of
life
and
to
answer
the
requirements
of
the
human
spirit
all
that
regal
power
liberally
and
wisely
used
can
confer
belongs
to
protus
in
his
tyranny
all
that
genius
and
learning
and
art
can
confer
is
the
possession
of
cleon
and
a
profound
discouragement
has
settled
down
upon
the
soul
of
each
the
race
progresses
from
point
to
point
is
deepened
and
quickened
as
generation
succeeds
generation
the
sympathies
of
the
individual
are
multiplied
and
extended
but
he
that
increases
knowledge
increases
sorrow
most
progress
is
most
failure
the
soul
climbs
the
heights
only
to
perish
there
every
day
the
sense
of
joy
grows
more
acute
every
day
the
soul
grows
more
enlarged
and
every
day
the
power
to
put
our
best
attainments
to
use
diminishes
and
how
dieth
the
wise
man
as
the
fool
therefore
i
hated
life
yea
i
hated
all
my
labour
that
i
had
taken
under
the
sun
the
poem
is
indeed
an
ecclesiastes
of
pagan
religion
the
assurance
of
extinction
is
the
worm
which
gnaws
at
the
heart
of
the
rose
it
is
so
horrible
i
dare
at
times
imagine
to
my
need
some
future
state
revealed
to
us
by
zeus
unlimited
in
capability
for
joy
as
this
is
in
desire
for
joy
but
this
is
no
better
than
a
dream
zeus
could
not
but
have
revealed
it
were
it
possible
browning
does
not
bring
his
cleon
as
pater
brings
his
marius
into
the
christian
catacombs
where
the
image
of
the
shepherd
bearing
his
lamb
might
interpret
the
mystery
of
death
nor
to
that
house
of
cecilia
where
marius
sees
a
new
joy
illuminating
every
face
cleon
has
heard
of
paulus
and
of
christus
but
who
can
suppose
that
a
mere
barbarian
jew
hath
access
to
a
secret
shut
from
us
the
doctrine
of
christ
preached
on
the
island
by
certain
slaves
is
reported
by
an
intelligent
listener
to
be
one
which
no
sane
man
can
accept
and
cleon
will
not
squander
the
time
that
might
be
well
employed
in
studying
the
proportions
of
a
man
or
in
combining
the
moods
of
music
the
later
hours
of
a
philosopher
and
a
poet
on
the
futile
creed
of
slaves
immortality
and
divine
love
these
were
the
great
words
pronounced
by
paul
and
by
christ
is
the
despairing
cry
of
pagan
culture
for
the
life
beyond
the
grave
which
would
attune
to
harmony
the
dissonances
of
earth
and
render
intelligible
its
mournful
obscurities
in
the
completed
form
of
and
epistle
of
are
the
one
a
prophecy
the
other
a
divination
of
the
mystery
of
the
love
of
god
in
the
life
and
death
of
his
son
the
culminating
moment
in
the
effort
of
david
by
which
he
rouses
to
life
the
sunken
soul
of
the
king
the
moment
towards
which
all
others
tend
is
that
in
which
he
finds
in
his
own
nature
love
as
god
ultimate
gift
and
assured
that
in
this
as
in
other
gifts
the
creature
can
not
surpass
the
creator
he
breaks
forth
into
a
prophecy
of
god
love
made
perfect
in
weakness
o
saul
it
shall
be
a
face
like
my
face
that
receives
thee
a
man
like
to
me
thou
shalt
love
and
be
loved
by
for
ever
a
hand
like
this
hand
shall
throw
open
the
gates
of
new
life
to
thee
see
the
christ
stand
what
follows
in
the
poem
is
only
the
awe
the
solemnity
of
this
discovery
which
has
come
not
through
any
processes
of
reasoning
but
by
a
passionate
interpretation
of
the
enthusiasm
of
love
and
in
david
own
heart
only
this
awe
and
the
seeming
extension
of
his
throbbing
emotion
and
pent
knowledge
over
the
face
of
external
nature
until
night
passes
and
with
the
dawn
earth
and
heaven
resume
their
wonted
ways
the
case
of
lazarus
as
studied
by
karshish
the
arabian
physician
results
not
in
a
rapturous
prophecy
like
that
of
david
but
in
a
stupendous
conjecture
of
the
heart
which
all
the
scepticism
of
the
brain
of
a
man
of
science
can
not
banish
or
reduce
to
insignificance
the
unaccountable
fascination
of
this
case
of
mania
subinduced
by
epilepsy
is
not
to
be
resisted
karshish
would
write
if
he
could
of
more
important
matters
than
the
madman
of
bethany
he
would
record
his
discoveries
in
describe
the
peculiar
qualities
of
and
disclose
the
secret
of
those
virtues
derived
from
the
mottled
spiders
of
the
tombs
but
the
face
of
lazarus
patient
or
joyous
the
strange
remoteness
in
his
gaze
his
singular
valuations
of
objects
and
events
his
great
ardour
his
great
calm
his
possession
of
some
secret
which
gives
new
meanings
to
all
things
the
perfect
logic
of
his
irrationality
his
unexampled
gentleness
and
love
these
are
memories
which
the
arabian
physician
is
unable
to
put
by
so
curious
so
attaching
a
potency
lies
in
the
person
of
this
man
who
holds
that
he
was
dead
and
rose
again
karshish
has
a
certain
sense
of
shame
that
he
a
man
learned
in
all
the
wisdom
of
his
day
should
be
so
deeply
moved
and
yet
how
the
thought
of
the
secret
possessed
by
this
judean
maniac
it
is
the
secret
of
jesus
fills
and
expands
the
soul
the
very
god
think
abib
dost
thou
think
so
the
were
the
too
so
through
the
thunder
comes
a
human
voice
saying
o
heart
i
made
a
heart
beats
here
face
my
hands
fashioned
see
it
in
myself
thou
hast
no
power
nor
mayst
conceive
of
mine
but
love
i
gave
thee
with
myself
to
love
and
thou
must
love
me
who
have
died
for
thee
science
has
at
least
something
to
consider
in
a
thought
so
strangely
potent
a
sceptic
exposition
of
his
christian
faith
is
the
paradoxical
subject
of
blougram
and
it
is
one
which
admirably
suited
that
side
of
browning
genius
which
leaned
towards
intellectual
casuistry
but
the
poem
is
not
only
skilful
casuistry
and
casuistry
let
it
be
remembered
is
not
properly
the
art
of
defending
falsehood
but
of
determining
truth
it
is
also
a
chosen
from
the
age
of
doubt
a
dramatic
monologue
with
an
appropriate
en
a
display
of
fence
and
thrust
which
as
a
piece
of
art
and
wit
rewards
an
intelligent
spectator
that
cardinal
wiseman
sat
for
the
bishop
portrait
is
a
matter
of
little
consequence
the
merit
of
the
study
is
independent
of
any
connection
with
an
individual
it
answers
delightfully
the
cynical
yet
not
wholly
cynical
question
how
for
our
gain
in
both
worlds
can
we
best
economise
our
scepticism
and
make
a
little
belief
go
far
the
nineteenth
century
is
not
precisely
the
age
of
the
martyrs
or
if
we
are
to
find
them
we
must
in
general
turn
to
politics
and
to
science
bishop
blougram
does
not
pique
himself
on
a
genius
for
martyrdom
if
he
fights
with
beasts
it
is
on
this
occasion
with
a
very
small
one
a
lynx
of
the
literary
tribe
and
in
the
arena
of
his
own
over
the
wine
he
is
a
man
of
his
time
when
the
cross
and
its
doctrine
can
be
comfortably
borne
both
he
and
his
honoured
for
this
one
occasion
only
with
the
episcopal
invitation
appreciate
the
good
things
of
this
world
but
the
bishop
has
a
vast
advantage
over
the
maker
of
lively
lightsome
articles
for
the
reviews
and
he
uses
his
advantage
it
must
be
confessed
to
the
full
we
are
in
company
with
no
petty
man
while
we
read
the
poem
and
hear
the
great
bishop
roll
out
with
easy
affluence
his
long
crumpled
mind
he
is
delightfully
frank
and
delightfully
subtle
concealing
himself
by
opulent
in
ideas
shifting
the
pea
of
truth
dexterously
under
the
three
gilded
thimbles
blandly
condescending
and
amiably
contemptuous
a
little
feline
for
he
allows
his
adversary
a
moment
freedom
to
escape
and
then
pounces
upon
him
with
the
claws
assured
of
his
superiority
in
the
game
yet
using
only
half
his
mind
fencing
with
one
arm
pinioned
with
a
rook
and
pawn
given
to
his
antagonist
or
shall
we
say
blindfold
and
seeing
every
piece
upon
the
board
is
blougram
a
poem
at
all
some
literary
critics
may
ask
and
the
answer
is
that
through
it
we
make
acquaintance
with
one
of
browning
most
genial
inventions
the
great
bishop
himself
and
that
if
gigadibs
were
not
present
we
could
never
have
seen
him
at
the
particular
angle
at
which
he
presents
himself
in
his
condescending
play
with
truths
and
and
adapted
to
a
smaller
mind
than
his
own
the
sixteenth
century
gave
us
a
montaigne
and
the
seventeenth
century
a
pascal
why
should
not
the
nineteenth
century
of
mundane
comforts
of
doubt
troubled
by
faith
and
faith
troubled
by
doubt
produce
a
new
type
serious
yet
humorous
in
an
episcopal
browning
moral
sympathies
we
may
rest
assured
do
not
go
with
one
who
like
blougram
finds
satisfaction
in
things
realised
on
earth
one
who
declines
at
least
as
he
represents
himself
for
the
purposes
of
argument
to
press
forward
to
things
which
he
can
not
attain
but
might
nobly
follow
after
but
browning
intellectual
interest
is
great
in
seeing
all
that
a
blougram
can
say
for
himself
and
as
a
destructive
piece
of
criticism
directed
against
the
position
of
a
gigadibs
what
he
says
may
really
be
effective
the
bishop
frankly
admits
that
the
unqualified
believer
the
enthusiast
is
more
fortunate
than
he
he
sylvester
blougram
is
what
he
is
and
all
that
he
can
do
is
to
make
the
most
of
the
nature
allotted
to
him
that
there
has
been
a
divine
revelation
he
can
not
absolutely
believe
but
neither
can
he
absolutely
disbelieve
unbelief
is
sterile
belief
is
fruitful
certainly
for
this
world
probably
for
the
next
and
he
elects
to
believe
having
chosen
to
believe
he
can
not
be
too
pronounced
and
decisive
in
his
faith
he
will
never
attempt
to
eliminate
certain
articles
of
the
and
so
decrassify
his
faith
for
to
this
process
if
once
begun
there
is
no
end
having
donned
his
uniform
he
will
wear
it
laces
and
spangles
and
all
true
he
has
at
times
his
chill
fits
of
doubt
but
is
not
this
the
probation
of
faith
does
not
a
life
evince
the
ultimate
reality
that
is
within
us
are
not
acts
the
evidence
of
a
final
choice
of
a
deepest
conviction
and
has
he
not
given
his
vote
for
the
christian
religion
with
me
faith
means
perpetual
unbelief
kept
quiet
like
the
snake
michael
foot
who
stands
calm
just
because
he
feels
it
writhe
when
the
time
arrives
for
a
beatific
vision
blougram
will
be
ready
to
adapt
himself
to
the
new
state
of
things
is
not
the
best
pledge
of
his
capacity
for
future
adaptation
to
a
new
environment
this
that
being
in
the
world
he
is
worldly
we
must
not
lose
the
training
of
each
successive
stage
of
evolution
by
for
ever
projecting
ourselves
half
way
into
the
next
so
rolls
on
the
argument
to
its
triumphant
conclusion
fool
or
knave
why
needs
a
bishop
be
a
fool
or
knave
when
there
a
thousand
diamond
weights
between
only
at
the
last
were
it
not
that
we
know
that
there
is
a
firmer
ground
for
blougram
than
this
on
which
he
takes
his
stand
in
controversy
we
might
be
inclined
to
close
the
subject
by
adapting
to
its
uses
the
title
of
a
pamphlet
connected
with
the
kingsley
and
newman
debate
but
was
not
mr
gigadibs
right
after
all
worsted
in
he
certainly
was
but
the
soul
may
have
its
say
and
the
soul
armed
with
its
instincts
of
truth
is
a
formidable
challenger

in

would
set
me
down
even

shoved

upside
down
in

bundle
happily
the
winter
was
of
a
miraculous
mildness
mrs
browning
worked
in
a
sort
of
and
browning
set
himself
to
the
task
a
fruitless
one
as
it
proved
of
rehandling
and
revising
i
lately
gave
time
and
pains
he
afterwards
told
milsand
in
his

to
turn
my
work
into
what
the
many
might
instead
of
what
the

after
all
i
imagined
another

therefore

with
pleasure
that
her

hostility

that
he
was
sick
of
the
opposition
in
may
tidings
from
london
of
the
illness
of
kenyon
caused
him
serious
anxiety
he
would
gladly
have
hastened
to
attend
upon
so
true
and
dear
a
friend
but
this
kenyon
would
not
permit
a
month
later
he
and
mrs
browning
were
in
occupation
of
kenyon
house
in
devonshire
place
which
he
had
lent
to
them
for
the
summer
but
the
invalid
had
sought
for
restoration
of
his
health
in
the
isle
of
wight
on
the
day
that
mr
barrett
heard
of
his
daughter
arrival
he
ordered
his
family
away
from
london
mrs
browning
once
more
wrote
to
him
but

received
no

if
you

very
very
naughty
i
advise
you
to
go
into
the
room
and

be
but
the
situation
as
mrs
browning
sadly
confesses
was
hopeless
some
companionship
with
her
sister
arabel
and
her
brothers
was
gained
by
a
swift
departure
from
london
in
august
for
ventnor
whither
the
wimpole
street
household
leaving
its
master
behind
had
been
banished
and
there
a
happy
sorrowful
two
weeks
were
spent
at
cowes
a
grief
awaited
browning
and
his
wife
for
they
found
kenyon
kind
as
ever
but
grievously
broken
in
health
and
depressed

the
summer
and
autumn
in

before
the

of

they
were

way
to

are
long
gone
back
now
wrote
dante
rossetti
in

and
with
them
one
of
my
delights
an
evening
resort
where
i
never
felt
unhappy
how
large
a
part
of
the
real
world
i
wonder
are
those
two
small
people
taking
meanwhile
so
little
room
in
any
railway
carriage
and
hardly
needing
a
double
bed
at
the
inn
the
great
event
of
the
autumn
for
the
brownings
and
for
the
lovers
of
english
poetry
was
the
publication
of
its
popularity
was
instantaneous
within
a
fortnight
a
second
edition
was
called
for
there
was
no
time
to
alter
even
a
comma
that
robert
writes
mrs
browning
is
in
ecstasies
about
it
far
more
than
if
it
all
related
to
a
book
of
his
own
the
volume
was
dedicated
to
john
kenyon
but
before
the
year
was
at
an
end
kenyon
was
dead
since
the
birth
of
their
son
he
had
enlarged
the
somewhat
slender
incomings
of
his
friends
by
the
annual
gift
of
one
hundred
pounds
in
order
says
the
editor
of
mrs
browning
letters
that
they
might
be
more
free
to
follow
their
art
for
its
own
sake
only
by
his
will
he
placed
them
for
the
future
above
all
possibility
of
straitened
means
to
browning
he
left
to
mrs
browning
these
adds
mr
kenyon
were
the
largest
legacies
in
a
very
generous
will
the
fitting
end
to
a
life
passed
in
acts
of
generosity
and
kindness
to
those
in
need
the
gain
to
the
brownings
was
shadowed
by
a
sense
of
loss
christmas
came
says
mrs
browning
like
a
cloud
for
the
length
of
three
winter
months
she
did
not
stir
out
of
doors
then
arrived
spring
and
sunshine
carnival
time
and
universal
madness
in
florence
with
streets
one
gigantic
pantomime
penini
begged
importunately
for
a
domino
and
could
not
be
refused
and
penini
father
and
mother
were
for
once
drawn
into
the
vortex
of
italian
gaiety
when
at
the
great
opera
ball
a
little
figure
in
mask
and
domino
was
struck
on
the
shoulder
with
the
salutation
bella
mascherina
it
was
mrs
browning
who
received
the
stroke
with
her
husband
also
in
domino
by
her
side
the
absence
of
real
coarseness
in
the
midst
of
so
much
seeming
license
and
the
perfect
social
equality
gave
her
a
gratifying
impression
of
her
florentines
in
april
it
was
summer
weather
the
drives
of
former
days
in
the
cascine
and
to
bellosguardo
where
a
friend
miss
isa
blagden
occupied
a
villa
were
resumed
an
american
authoress
of
wider
fame
since
her
book
of
than
even
the
authoress
of
mrs
beecher
stowe
was
in
florence
and
somewhat
to
their
surprise
she
charmed
both
browning
and
his
wife
by
her
simplicity
and
earnestness
her
gentle
voice
and
refinement
of
manner
never
says
mrs
browning
did
lioness
roar
more
softly
all
pointed
to
renewed
happiness
but
before
april
was
over
pain
of
a
kind
that
had
a
peculiar
sting
left
mrs
browning
for
a
time
incapable
of
any
other
feeling
her
father
was
dead
and
no
word
of
affection
had
been
uttered
at
the
last
if
there
was
water
in
the
rock
it
never
welled
forth
the
kindly
meant
effort
of
a
relative
to
reopen
friendly
communications
between
mr
barrett
and
his
daughters
not
many
months
previously
had
for
its
only
result
the
declaration
that
they
had
disgraced
the
family
at
first
mrs
browning
was
crushed
and
could
shed
no
tear
she
remained
for
many
days
in
a
state
of
miserable
prostration
it
was
two
months
before
she
could
write
a
letter
to
anyone
outside
the
circle
of
her
nearest
kinsfolk
once
more
the
july
heat
in
florence
a
composition
of
gehenna
and
paradise
drove
the
brownings
to
the
baths
of
lucca
miss
blagden
followed
them
and
also
young
lytton
came
ailing
it
was
thought
from
exposure
to
the
sun
his
indisposition
soon
grew
serious
and
declared
itself
as
a
gastric
fever
for
eight
nights
isa
blagden
sat
by
his
bedside
as
nurse
for
eight
other
nights
browning
took
her
place
his
own
health
remained
vigorous
each
morning
he
bathed
in
a
rapid
mountain
stream
each
evening
and
morning
he
rode
a
mountain
pony
and
in
due
time
he
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
the
patient
although
still
weak
and
hollow
cheeked
convalescent
and
beginning
to
think
of
poems
and
apple
puddings
as
mrs
browning
declares
in
a
manner
other
than
celestial
it
had
been
a
summer
she
said
in
september
full
of
blots
vexations
anxieties
three
days
after
these
words
were
written
a
new
and
grave
anxiety
troubled
her
and
her
husband
for
their
son
who
had
been
looking
like
a
rose
like
a
rose
possessed
by
a
fairy
is
his
description
was
attacked
in
the
same
way
as
lytton
do
be
unhappy
for
said
pen
think
it
a
poor
little
boy
in
the
street
and
be
just
only
a
little
sorry
and
not
unhappy
at
all
within
less
than
a
fortnight
he
was
well
enough
to
have
agonising
visions
of
beefsteak
pies
and
buttered
toast
seen
in
but
his
mother
mourned
for
the
rosy
cheeks
and
round
fat
little
shoulders
and
confessed
that
she
herself
was
worn
out
in
body
and
soul
the
winter
at
florence
was
the
coldest
for
many
years
the
edges
of
the
arno
were
frozen
and
in
the
spring
of
mrs
browning
felt
that
her
powers
of
resistance
weakened
by
a
year
of
troubles
and
anxieties
had
fallen
low
browning
himself
was
in
vigorous
health
when
he
called
in
june
on
hawthorne
he
looked
younger
and
even
handsomer
than
he
had
looked
two
years
previously
and
his
gray
hairs
seemed
fewer
he
talked

goes
on
a
wonderful
quantity
in
a
little
time
that
evening
the
hawthornes
spent
at
casa
guidi
mrs
browning
is
described
by
the
american
novelist
as
if
she
were
one
of
the
singular
creatures
of
his
own
imagination
no
earthly
woman
but
one
of
the
elfin
race
yet
sweetly
disposed
towards
human
beings
a
wonder
of
charm
in
littleness
with
a
shrill
yet
sweet
tenuity
of
voice
there
is
not
such
another
figure
in
the
world
and
her
black
ringlets
cluster
into
her
neck
and
make
her
face
look
whiter
by
their
sable
perfection
browning
himself
was
very
efficient
in
keeping
up
conversation
with
everybody
and
seemed
to
be
in
all
parts
of
the
room
and
in
every
group
at
the
same
moment
a
most
vivid
and
person
logical
and
as
i
presume
poets
generally
are
in
their
daily
talk
his
conversation
says
hawthorne
speaking
of
a
visit
to
miss
blagden
at
bellosguardo
has
the
effervescent
aroma
which
you
can
not
catch
even
if
you
get
the
very
words
that
seem
to
be
imbued
with
it
his
nonsense
is
of
very
genuine
and
excellent
quality
the
true
babble
and
effervescence
of
a
bright
and
powerful
mind
and
he
lets
it
play
among
his
friends
with
the
faith
and
simplicity
of
a
child
when
summer
came
it
was
decided
to
join
browning
father
and
sister
in
paris
and
accompany
them
to
some
french
seaside
resort
where
mrs
browning
could
have
the
benefit
of
a
course
of
warm
baths
to
her
the
sea
was
a
terror
but
was
repose
and
browning
suggested
on
the
way
from
marseilles
to
paris
that
they
might
ride
ride
together
for
ever
ride
during
the
remainder
of
their
lives
in
a
carriage
with
renewed
supplies
of
french
novels
and
they
reached
paris
on
the
elder
mr
birthday
and
found
him
radiant
at
the
meeting
with
his
son
and
grandson
looking
indeed
ten
years
younger
than
when
they
had
last
seen
his
face
paris
mrs
browning
declares
was
her
weakness
italy
her
passion
florence
itself
was
her
where
she
could
sulk
and
be
happy
the
life
of
the
brilliant
city
which
murmurs
so
of
the
fountain
of
intellectual
youth
for
ever
and
ever
quickened
her
its
new
architectural
splendours
told
of
the
magnificence
in
design
and
in
its
accomplishment
of
her
hero
the
emperor
and
here
she
and
her
husband
met
their
helpful
friend
of
former
days
father
prout
and
they
were
both
grieved
and
cheered
by
the
sight
of
lady
elgin
a
paralytic
in
her
not
able
to
articulate
a
word
but
bright
and
gracious
as
ever
the
eloquent
soul
full
and
radiant
alive
to
both
worlds
the
happiness
in
presence
of
such
a
victory
of
the
spirit
was
greater
than
the
pain
having
failed
to
find
agreeable
quarters
at
etretat
where
browning
in
a
fine
phrenzy
had
hired
a
wholly
unsuitable
house
with
a
for
view
and
escaped
from
his
bad
bargain
a
loser
of
some
francs
at
his
wife
entreaty
they
settled
for
a
short
time
at
havre
detestable
place
mrs
browning
calls
it
in
a
house
close
to
the
sea
and
surrounded
by
a
garden
on
a
bench
by
the
shore
mrs
browning
could
sit
and
win
back
a
little
strength
in
the
bright
august
air
the
stay
at
havre
depressing
to
browning
spirits
was
for
some
eight
weeks
in
october
they
were
again
in
paris
where
mrs
browning
sister
arabel
was
their
companion
the
year
was
far
advanced
and
a
visit
to
england
was
not
in
contemplation
towards
the
middle
of
the
month
they
were
once
more
in
motion
journeying
by
slow
stages
to
florence
a
day
was
spent
at
chamb√©ry
for
the
sake
of
les
charmettes
and
rousseau
when
casa
guidi
was
at
length
reached
it
was
only
a
on
the
way
to
rome
winter
had
suddenly
rushed
in
and
buried
all
italy
in
snow
but
when
they
started
for
rome
in
a
carriage
kindly
lent
by
their
american
friends
the
eckleys
it
was
again
like
summer
the
adventures
of
the
way
were
chiefly
of
a
negative
kind
occasioned
by
precipices
over
which
they
were
not
thrown
and
banditti
who
never
came
in
sight
but
in
a
quarrel
between
one
of
whom
attacked
the
other
with
a
knife
browning
with
characteristic
energy
dashed
between
them
to
the
terror
of
the
rest
of
the
party
his
garments
were
the
only
serious
sufferers
from
his
zeal
as
mediator
the
apartment
engaged
at
rome
was
that
of
the
earlier
visit
of
in
the
via
bocca
di
leone
rooms
swimming
all
day
in
sunshine
on
christmas
morning
mrs
browning
was
able
to
accompany
her
husband
to
st
peter
to
hear
the
silver
trumpets
but
january
froze
the
fountains
and
the
north
wind
blew
with
force
mrs
browning
had
just
completed
a
careful
revision
aurora
and
now
she
could
rest
enjoy
the
sunshine
streaming
through
their
six
windows
or
give
herself
up
to
the
excitement
of
italian
politics
as
seen
through
the
newspapers
in
the
opening
of
a
most
eventful
year
robert
and
i
she
wrote
on
the
eve
of
the
declaration
of
war
between
austria
and
victor
emmanuel
have
been
of
one
mind
lately
on
these
things
which
comforts
me
much
she
had
also
the
satisfaction
of
health
enjoyed
at
least
by
proxy
for
her
husband
had
never
been
more
full
of
vigour
and
the
spirit
of
enjoyment
in
the
freezing
days
of
january
he
was
out
of
his
bed
at
six
and
away
for
a
brisk
morning
walk
with
mr
eckley
the
loaf
at
breakfast
diminished
by
gargantuan
slices
into
the
social
life
of
rome
he
threw
himself
with
ardour
for
a
fortnight
immediately
after
christmas
he
was
out
every
night
sometimes
with
double
and
treble
engagements
dissipations
says
mrs
browning
decidedly
agree
with
robert
no
denying
that
though
he
horribly
hypocritical
and
an
evening
with
me
at
home
he
gathered
various
coloured
fragments
of
life
from
the
outer
world
and
brought
them
home
to
brighten
her
hours
of
imprisonment
when
they
returned
to
florence
in
may
the
grand
duke
had
withdrawn
the
city
was
occupied
by
french
troops
and
there
was
unusual
animation
in
the
streets
browning
shared
to
some
extent
in
his
wife
alienation
from
the
policy
of
england
and
believed
but
with
less
than
her
enthusiastic
confidence
in
the
good
intentions
towards
italy
of
the
french
emperor
he
subscribed
his
ten
scudi
a
month
to
the
italian
and
rewarded
pen
for
diligence
in
his
lessons
with
half
a
paul
a
day
which
the
boy
might
give
as
his
own
contribution
to
the
cause
of
italian
independence
the
french
and
the
italian
tricolour
flags
displayed
by
pen
adorned
the
terrace
in
june
the
sun
beat
upon
florence
with
unusual
fierceness
but
it
was
a
month
of
battles
and
with
bulletins
of
the
war
arriving
twice
a
day
they
could
not
bear
to
remove
to
any
quiet
retreat
at
a
distance
from
the
centre
it
was
not
curiosity
that
detained
them
but
the
passion
for
italy
the
joy
in
generous
effort
and
great
deeds
in
the
rebound
as
mrs
browning
expresses
it
from
hopes
and
fears
for
italy
they
found
themselves
drawn
to
the
theatre
where
salvini
gave
his
wonderful
impersonation
of
othello
and
his
hamlet
very
great
in
both
robert
thought
so
commented
mrs
browning
as
well
as
i
the
strain
of
excitement
was
indeed
excessive
for
mrs
browning
failing
physical
strength
there
was
in
it
something
almost
febrile
yet
the
fact
is
noteworthy
that
the
romantic
figures
secured
much
less
of
her
interest
than
the
men
of
prudent
statesmanship
she
esteemed
cavour
highly
she
wholly
distrusted
mazzini
she
justified
louis
napoleon
in
concessions
which
she
regarded
as
an
unavoidable
part
of
diplomacy
directed
to
ends
which
could
not
be
immediately
attained
garibaldi
was
a
hero
but
somewhat
alarming
in
his
heroisms
a
grand
child
not
a
man
of
much
brain
after
the
victories
of
magenta
and
solferino
came
what
seemed
to
many
the
great
betrayal
of
villafranca
for
a
day
the
busts
and
portraits
of
the
french
emperor
suddenly
disappeared
from
the
of
florence
and
even
mrs
browning
would
not
let
her
boy
wear
his
napoleon
medal
but
the
busts
returned
to
their
places
and
mrs
browning
faith
in
napoleon
sprang
up
anew
it
was
not
he
who
was
the
criminal
the
selfish
powers
of
europe
had
forced
his
hand
and
truncated
his
great
intentions
she
rejoiced
in
the
magnificent
spectacle
of
dignity
and
calm
presented
by
the
people
of
italy
and
yet
her
fall
from
the
clouds
to
earth
on
the
announcement
of
peace
with
austria
was
a
shattering
experience
sleep
left
her
or
if
she
slept
her
dreams
were
affected
by
inscrutable
articles
of
peace
and
endless
provisional
governments
night
after
night
her
husband
watched
beside
her
and
in
the
day
he
not
only
gave
his
boy
the
accustomed
two
lesson
on
the
piano
but
replaced
the
boy
mother
as
teacher
of
those
miscellaneous
lessons
which
had
been
her
educational
province
robert
has
been
perfect
to
me
expressed
mrs
browning
feelings
in
a
word
another
anxiety
gave
browning
an
opportunity
which
he
turned
to
account
in
a
way
that
renders
honour
and
gratitude
his
due
from
all
lovers
of
english
letters
at
a
great
old
age
landor
who
resided
with
his
family
at
fiesole
still
retained
his
violent
and
intractable
temper
in
his
home
there
was
much
to
excite
his
leonine
wrath
and
sense
of
intolerable
wrong
three
times
he
had
quitted
his
villa
with
vows
never
to
return
to
it
and
three
times
he
had
been
led
back
when
for
a
fourth
time
like
a
feeble
yet
majestic
lear
one
hot
summer
day
toward
noon
he
flung
himself
or
was
flung
out
of
doors
with
only
a
few
pauls
in
his
pocket
it
was
to
casa
guidi
that
he
made
his
way
yet
breathing
forth
wrath
browning
had
often
said
as
his
wife
tells
her
that
he
owed
more
as
a
writer
to
landor
than
to
any
other
contemporary
he
resolved
to
set
things
right
if
possible
and
if
not
to
make
the
best
of
a
case
that
could
not
be
entirely
amended
a
visit
to
the
villa
assured
him
that
reconciliation
was
out
of
the
question
he
provided
for
landor
immediate
wants
communicated
with
landor
brothers
in
england
who
were
prompt
in
arranging
for
a
regular
allowance
to
be
administered
by
browning
became
the
old
man
guide
and
guardian
soothed
his
wounded
spirit
although
according
to
mrs
browning
not
often
happy
when
he
attempted
compliments
with
generous
words
and
ready
quotations
from
landor
own
writings
and
finally
settled
him
in
florence
under
the
care
of
mrs
browning
faithful
maid
wilson
who
watched
over
him
during
the
remainder
of
his
life
to
his
incredulous
wife
browning
spoke
of
landor
sweetness
and
gentleness
nor
was
he
wrong
in
ascribing
these
qualities
to
the
old
lion
she
admitted
that
he
had
generous
impulses
but
feared
that
her
husband
would
before
long
become
like
other
friends
of
landor
the
object
of
some
enraged
suspicion
nothing
coheres
in
him
she
writes
either
in
his
opinions
or
i
fear
affections
but
landor
whose
courtesy
and
refinement
she
acknowledges
had
also
a
heart
that
was
capable
of
loyal
love
and
gratitude
after
the
first
burst
of
rage
against
the
fiesole
household
had
spent
itself
he
beguiled
the
time
in
perpetuating
his
indignations
in
an
innocent
and
classical
form
that
of
latin
alcaics
directed
against
one
private
and
one
public
foe
his
wife
and
the
emperor
louis
napoleon
lander
affairs
threatened
to
detain
the
brownings
in
florence
longer
than
they
desired
now
that
peace
had
come
and
it
was
not
indispensable
to
run
out
of
doors
twice
a
day
in
order
to
inspect
the
bulletins
but
after
three
weeks
of
very
exhausting
illness
mrs
browning
needed
change
of
air
as
soon
as
her
strength
allowed
she
was
lifted
into
a
carriage
and
they
journeyed
as
in
the
year
to
the
neighbourhood
of
siena
she
reached
the
villa
which
had
been
engaged
by
story
aid
with
the
sense
of
a
peculiar
frailty
of
being
though
confined
to
the
house
the
fresher
air
by
day
and
the
night
winds
gradually
revived
her
strength
and
spirits
the
silence
and
repose
were
heavenly
things
to
her
the
pretty
dimpled
ground
covered
by
low
vineyards
rested
her
eyes
and
her
mind
and
for
excitements
instead
of
reports
of
there
were
scarlet
sunsets
over
purple
hills
a
kind
prussian
physician
gresonowsky
who
had
attended
mrs
browning
in
florence
and
who
entered
sympathetically
into
her
political
feelings
followed
her
uninvited
to
siena
and
gave
her
the
benefit
of
his
care
declining
all
recompense
the
good
friends
from
america
the
storys
were
not
far
off
and
landor
after
a
visit
to
story
was
placed
in
occupation
of
rooms
not
a
from
their
villa
with
pen
it
was
a
time
of
rejoicing
for
his
father
had
bought
the
boy
a
sardinian
pony
of
the
colour
of
his
curls
and
he
was
to
be
seen
galloping
through
the
lanes
like
puck
to
use
browning
comparison
on
a
back
the
gipsy
instinct
the
desire
of
wandering
had
greatly
declined
with
both
husband
and
wife
since
the
earlier
days
in
italy
yet
when
they
returned
to
casa
guidi
it
was
only
for
six
weeks
even
at
the
close
of
the
visit
to
siena
mrs
browning
had
recovered
but
a
slender
modicum
of
strength
she
did
not
dare
to
enter
the
cathedral
for
there
were
steps
to
climb
at
florence
she
felt
her
old
vitality
return
and
her
spirits
rose
but
the
climate
of
rome
was
considered
by
dr
gresonowsky
more
suitable
for
winter
and
towards
the
close
of
november
they
took
their
departure
flying
from
the
florentine
tramontana
the
carriage
was
furnished
with
novels
of
balzac
and
pen
pony
was
of
the
party
the
rooms
taken
in
the
via
del
tritone
were
bright
and
sunny
but
a
rash
visit
to
the
jeweller
castellani
to
see
and
touch
the
swords
presented
by
roman
citizens
to
napoleon
iii
and
victor
emmanuel
threw
back
mrs
browning
into
all
her
former
troubles
of
a
delicate
chest
and
left
her
as
weak
as
a
rag
tidings
of
the
death
of
lady
elgin
seemed
to
tell
only
of
a
peaceful
release
from
a
period
of
imprisonment
in
the
body
but
the
loss
of
mrs
jameson
was
a
painful
blow
rome
at
a
time
of
grave
political
apprehensions
was
almost
empty
of
foreigners
but
among
the
few
americans
who
had
courage
to
stay
were
the
sculptor
gibson
and
theodore
parker
now
near
the
close
of
his
life
whose
were
eloquent
of
beliefs
and
disbeliefs
as
the
spring
advanced
the
authoress
of
the
mill
on
the
floss
was
reported
to
be
now
and
again
visible
in
rome
with
her
elective
affinity
as
mrs
browning
puts
it
on
the
corso
walking
or
in
the
vatican
musing
always
together
a
of
lord
byron
very
quiet
and
very
intense
was
among
the
visitors
at
the
via
del
tritone
and
lady
marion
alford
very
eager
about
literature
and
art
and
robert
for
all
which
eagernesses
mrs
browning
felt
bound
to
care
for
her
the
artists
and
prinsep
had
made
browning
acquaintance
at
siena
prinsep
now
introduced
him
to
some
of
the
of
popular
life
in
rome
together
they
witnessed
the
rivalry
of
two
improvisatori
poetic
gamecocks
whose
efforts
were
stimulated
by
the
announcement
that
a
great
poet
from
england
was
present
together
they
listened
to
the
forbidden
hymn
to
garibaldi
played
in
gigi
witnessed
the
dignified
blindness
of
the
papal
gendarmes
to
the
offence
while
gigi
liberally
plied
them
with
drink
and
together
to
relieve
the
host
of
all
fear
of
more
revolutionary
airs
they
took
carriages
with
their
musicians
and
drove
to
see
the
coliseum
by
moonlight
the
project
of
a
joint
volume
of
poems
on
the
italian
question
by
browning
and
his
wife
which
had
made
considerable
progress
towards
realisation
had
been
dropped
after
villafranca
when
browning
destroyed
his
poem
but
mrs
browning
had
advanced
alone
and
was
now
revising
proofs
of
her
slender
contribution
to
the
poetry
of
politics
before
she
wrote
them
she
says
simply
to
deliver
her
soul
to
get
the
relief
to
my
conscience
and
heart
which
comes
from
a
word
spoken
or
a
tear
shed
she
can
hardly
have
anticipated
that
they
would
be
popular
in
england
but
she
was
not
prepared
for
one
poem
which
denounced
american
slavery
being
misinterpreted
into
a
curse
pronounced
upon
england
robert
was
against
the
offending
review
she
says
i
never
saw
him
so
enraged
about
a
criticism
but
he
did
care
a
straw
his
wife
on
the
other
hand
was
more
deeply
pained
by
the
blindness
and
deafness
of
the
british
public
towards
her
husband
genius
nobody
except
a
small
knot
of
men
did
him
justice
his
publisher
returns
were
a
proof
of
this
not
to
be
gainsaid
not
one
copy
of
his
poems
had
for
six
months
been
sold
while
in
america
he
was
already
a
power
for
the
poetry
of
political
enthusiasm
he
had
certainly
no
vocation
when
savoy
was
surrendered
to
france
mrs
browning
suffered
some
pain
lest
her
generosity
might
seem
compromised
browning
admitted
that
the
liberation
of
italy
was
a
great
action
adding
cynically
of
his
future
prince
but
he
has
taken
for
it
which
is
a
pity
during
the
winter
he
wrote
much
robert
deserves
no
reproaches
his
wife
tells
her
friend
miss
haworth
in
may
for
he
has
been
writing
a
good
deal
this
winter
working
at
a
long
poem
which
i
have
not
seen
a
line
of
and
producing
short
lyrics
which
i
have
seen
and
may
declare
worthy
of
him
mr
kenyon
conjectures
that
the
long
poem
is
not
unlikely
to
have
been
sludge
the
for
performances
as
he
says
were
at
this
time
rampant
as
hitherto
both
husband
and
wife
showed
their
poems
each
to
the
other
only
when
the
poems
were
complete
thus
like
a
pair
of
hardy
friends
they
maintained
their
independence
even
when
they
read
there
was
no
reading
aloud
mrs
browning
was
indefatigable
in
her
passion
for
books
her
husband
with
muscular
energy
impatient
for
action
found
it
impossible
to
read
for
long
at
a
single
sitting
on
june
they
left
rome
travelling
by
vettura
through
orvieto
and
chiusi
to
their
home
in
florence
the
journey
fatigued
mrs
browning
but
on
arriving
they
had
the
happiness
of
finding
landor
well
he
looked
not
less
than
magnificent
displaying
the
most
beautiful
of
a
beard
all
in
a
curl
and
white
bubblement
of
beauty
wilson
had
the
old
man
under
happy
control
only
once
had
he
thrown
his
dinner
out
of
the
window
that
he
should
be
at
odds
with
all
the
world
was
inevitable
and
that
all
the
world
should
be
in
the
wrong
was
exhilarating
and
restorative
the
plans
for
the
summer
were
identical
with
those
of
the
preceding
year
the
same
great
lonely
villa
near
siena
was
occupied
again
the
same
deep
soothing
silence
lapped
to
rest
mrs
browning
spirits
landor
her
adopted
son
a
son
of
years
old
was
hard
by
as
he
had
been
last
summer
the
neighbourhood
of
miss
blagden
was
this
year
an
added
pleasure
the
little
eager
lady
as
henry
james
describes
her
with
gentle
gay
black
eyes
had
seen
much
read
much
written
already
a
little
with
more
to
follow
but
better
than
all
else
were
her
generous
heart
and
her
helpful
hand
the
season
was
one
of
unusual
coolness
for
italy
pen
pony
as
before
flashed
through
the
lanes
and
along
the
roads
browning
had
returned
from
rome
in
robust
health
and
looking
stouter
in
person
than
six
months
previously
now
while
a
tenant
of
the
villa
alberti
he
spent
his
energies
in
long
rides
sometimes
rides
of
three
or
four
continuous
hours
on
returning
from
such
careers
on
horseback
little
inclination
although
he
had
his
solitary
room
in
which
to
work
remained
for
the
pursuit
of
poetry
the
departure
for
rome
was
early
about
september
in
the
via
felice
rooms
were
found
a
new
and
great
sorrow
had
fallen
upon
mrs
browning
her
sister
henrietta
mrs
surtees
cook
was
dead
leaving
behind
her
three
young
children
mrs
browning
could
not
shed
tears
nor
speak
of
her
grief
she
felt
tired
and
beaten
by
the
pain
and
tried
to
persuade
herself
that
for
one
who
believed
the
invisible
world
to
be
so
near
such
pain
was
but
a
weakness
her
husband
was
able
to
do
little
but
he
shared
in
his
degree
in
the
sense
of
loss
and
protected
her
from
the
intrusion
of
untimely
visitors
sir
john
bowring
was
admitted
because
he
presented
a
letter
of
introduction
and
had
intimate
relations
with
the
french
emperor
his
ridicule
of
the
volunteer
movement
in
england
with
its
cry
of
riflemen
form
was
grateful
to
mrs
browning
political
feelings
french
troops
were
now
in
rome
their
purpose
was
somewhat
ambiguous
but
pen
had
fraternised
with
the
officers
on
the
pincio
had
learnedly
discussed
chopin
and
stephen
heller
with
them
had
been
assured
that
they
did
not
mean
to
fight
for
the
holy
father
and
had
invited
ever
so
many
of
them
to
come
and
see
mamma
an
invitation
which
they
were
too
discreet
to
accept
mrs
browning
excitement
about
public
affairs
had
somewhat
abated
yet
she
watched
with
deep
interest
the
earlier
stages
of
the
great
struggle
in
america
and
she
did
not
falter
in
her
hopes
for
italy
by
intrigues
and
smuggling
the
newspapers
which
she
wished
to
see
were
obtained
through
the
courteous
french
generals
but
her
spirits
were
languid
i
gather
myself
up
by
fits
and
starts
she
confesses
and
then
fall
back
apart
from
his
anxieties
for
his
wife
health
and
the
unfailing
pleasure
in
his
boy
whom
a
french
or
italian
abb√©
now
instructed
browning
was
wholly
absorbed
in
one
new
interest
he
had
long
been
an
accomplished
musician
in
paris
he
had
devoted
himself
to
drawing
now
his
passion
was
for
modelling
in
clay
and
the
work
proceeded
under
the
direction
and
in
the
studio
of
his
friend
the
sculptor
story
his
previous
studies
in
anatomy
stood
him
in
good
stead
he
made
remarkable
progress
and
six
hours
a
day
passed
as
if
in
an
enchantment
he
ceased
even
to
read
nothing
but
clay
does
he
care
for
says
mrs
browning
smilingly
poor
lost
soul
the
union
of
intellectual
energy
with
physical
effort
in
such
work
gave
him
the
complete
satisfaction
for
which
he
craved
his
wife
grudged
a
little
she
says
the
time
stolen
from
his
special
art
of
poetry
but
she
saw
that
his
health
and
spirits
gained
from
his
happy
occupation
of
late
he
had
laboured
irregularly
at
verse
fits
of
active
effort
were
followed
by
long
intervals
during
which
production
seemed
impossible
and
some
vent
was
necessary
for
the
force
coiled
up
within
him
if
this
were
not
to
be
obtained
he
wore
himself
out
with
a
nervous
impatience
beating
his
dear
head
as
mrs
browning
describes
it
against
the
wall
simply
because
he
sees
a
fly
there
magnified
by
his
own
two
eyes
almost
indefinitely
into
some
saurian
monster
now
he
was
well
and
even
exultant
nothing
ever
he
declared
made
him
so
happy
before
of
advancing
years
browning
was
now
nearly
the
only
symptoms
were
that
he
had
lost
his
youthful
slightness
of
figure
and
that
his
beard
and
hair
were
somewhat
blanched
by
time
the
women
his
wife
wrote
to
his
sister
adore
him
everywhere
far
too
much
for
decency
and
to
herself
he
seemed
infinitely
handsomer
and
more
attractive
than
when
sixteen
years
previously
she
had
first
seen
him
on
the
whole
therefore
she
was
well
pleased
with
his
new
passion
for
clay
and
could
wish
for
him
loads
of
the
plastic
stuff
in
which
to
riot
afterwards
in
his
days
of
sorrow
in
london
when
he
compared
the
colour
of
his
life
to
that
of
a
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
one
minute
of
these
months
at
rome
would
yield
him
gold
enough
to
make
the
brightness
of
a
year
he
longed
for
the
smell
of
the
wet
clay
in
story
studio
where
the
songs
of
the
birds
and
the
bleat
of
a
goat
coming
through
the
little
door
to
the
left
were
heard
while
hoping
and
planning
for
the
future
his
wife
was
not
unaware
of
her
own
decline
for
the
first
time
she
writes
about
december
i
have
had
pain
in
looking
into
penini
face
lately
which
you
will
understand
and
a
little
earlier
i
wish
to
live
just
as
long
as
and
no
longer
than
to
grow
in
the
soul
the
winter
was
mild
though
snow
had
fallen
once
a
spell
of
colder
weather
was
reserved
for
the
month
of
may
they
thought
of
meeting
browning
father
and
sister
in
some
picturesque
part
of
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
or
if
that
should
prove
unsuitable
perhaps
at
trouville
mrs
browning
who
had
formerly
enjoyed
the
stir
of
life
in
paris
now
shrank
from
its
noise
and
bustle
her
wish
would
be
to
creep
into
a
cave
for
the
whole
year
at
eight
each
evening
she
left
her
and
sofa
and
was
in
bed
yet
she
trusted
that
when
she
could
venture
again
into
the
open
air
she
would
be
more
capable
of
enduring
the
friction
of
the
world
in
may
she
felt
stronger
and
saw
visitors
among
whom
was
hans
andersen
very
earnest
very
simple
very
childlike
a
little
later
she
was
cast
down
by
the
death
of
cavour
that
great
soul
which
meditated
and
made
italy
she
could
hardly
trust
herself
to
utter
his
name
it
was
evident
to
browning
that
the
journey
to
france
could
not
be
undertaken
without
serious
risk
they
had
reached
casa
guidi
and
there
for
the
present
she
must
take
her
rest
the
end
came
swiftly
gently
a
bronchial
attack
attended
with
no
more
than
the
usual
discomfort
found
her
with
diminished
power
of
resistance
browning
had
forebodings
of
evil
though
there
seemed
to
be
no
special
cause
to
warrant
his
apprehension
on
the
last
evening
june
she
herself
had
no
anticipation
of
what
was
at
hand
and
talked
of
their
summer
plans
when
she
slept
her
slumber
was
heavy
and
disturbed
at
four
in
the
morning
her
husband
was
alarmed
and
sent
to
summon
the
doctor
but
she
assured
him
that
his
fears
were
exaggerated
then
inestimable
words
were
spoken
which
lived
forever
in
his
heart
and
so
smilingly
happily
with
a
face
like
a
girl
resting
her
head
upon
her
husband
cheek
she
passed
away

when
all
that
was
needful

had

browning
first
thought
was
to
abandon
italy
for
many
a
year
and
hasten
to
london
there
to
have
speech
for
a
day
or
two
at
least
with
mrs
sister
arabel
the
cycle
is
complete
he
said
looking
round
the
of
casa
guidi
i
want
my
new
life
he
wrote
to
resemble
the
last
fifteen
years
as
little
as
possible
yet
while
he
stayed
in
the
accustomed
rooms
he
held
himself
together
when
i
was
moved
he
says
i
began
to
go
to
pieces
yet
something
remained
to
sustain
him
to
one
who
has
habitually
given
as
well
as
received
much
not
the
least
of
the
pangs
of
separation
arises
from
the
incapacity
to
render
any
further
direct
service
it
fortified
browning
heart
to
know
that
much
could
be
done
and
in
ways
which
his
wife
would
have
approved
and
desired
for
her
child
and
as
he
himself
had
been
also
her
care
it
was
his
business
now
to
see
that
his
life
fulfilled
itself
aright
yet
he
breaks
out
in
july
no
more
for
me
even
with
my
family
i
shall
grow
still
i
hope
but
my
root
is
taken
and
remains
from
the
outward
paraphernalia
of
death
browning
as
mrs
orr
notices
shrank
with
aversion
it
was
partly
the
instinct
by
which
a
man
seeks
to
preserve
what
is
most
sacred
and
most
strong
in
his
own
feelings
from
the
poor
materialisms
and
the
poor
sentimentalisms
of
the
grave
partly
a
belief
that
any
advance
of
the
heart
towards
what
has
been
lost
may
be
rather
hindered
than
helped
by
the
external
circumstance
surrounding
the
forsaken
body
browning
took
measures
that
his
wife
grave
should
be
duly
cared
for
given
more
than
common
distinction
but
florence
became
a
place
from
which
even
for
his
own
sake
and
the
sake
of
her
whose
spirit
lived
within
him
he
must
henceforth
keep
aloof
the
first
immediate
claim
upon
browning
was
that
of
duty
to
his
father
on
august
he
left
florence
for
paris
accompanied
by
isa
blagden
who
still
watched
over
him
and
the
boy
two
months
were
spent
with
his
sister
and
the
old
man
still
hale
and
strong
of
heart
at
a
place
singularly
unspoiled
fresh
and
picturesque
and
lovely
to
content
so
browning
describes
it

enogat
near
st
malo

solitary
sea
the
sands

rocks

green
country
gave
him
at
least
a
then
he
proceeded
to
london
not
without
an
outbreak
of
his
characteristic
energy
in
the
difficulties
which
involved
two
hours
of
weary
battling
of
securing
a
for
pen
pony
at
amiens
tennyson
with
his
wife
and
children
was
on
the
platform
browning
pulled
his
hat
over
his
face
and
was
unrecognised
in
grim
london
as
he
had
called
it
though
with
a
quick
remorse
at
recollection
of
the
kindness
awaiting
him
he
had
the
comfort
of
daily
intercourse
with
miss
arabel
barrett
it
was
decided
that
an
english
education
but
not
that
of
a
public
school
would
be
best
for
the
boy
the
critical
time
for
taking
the
english
stamp
must
not
be
lost
his
father
instruction
aided
by
that
of
a
tutor
would
suffice
to
prepare
him
for
the
university
and
he
would
have
the
advantage
of
the
motherly
care
of
his
mother
favourite
sister
browning
distrusted
he
says
to
story
ambiguous
natures
and
nationalities
thus
he
bound
himself
to
england
and
to
london
while
at
times
he
sighed
for
the
beauty
of
italian
hills
and
skies
he
shrank
from
society
although
before
long
old
friends
and
especially
procter
infirm
and
deaf
were
not
neglected
he
found
or
made
business
for
himself
had
never
so
much
to
do
or
so
little
pleasure
in
doing
it
the
discomfort
of
london
lodgings
was
before
long
exchanged
for
the
more
congenial
surroundings
of
a
house
by
the
in
warwick
crescent
which
he
occupied
until
two
years
before
his
death
the
furniture
and
tapestries
of
casa
guidi
gave
it
an
air
of
comfort
and
repose
it
was
london
writes
mrs
ritchie
referring
to
her
visits
of
a
later
date
but
london
touched
by
some
indefinite
romance
the
canal
used
to
look
cool
and
deep
the
green
trees
used
to
shade
the
crescent
the
house
was
an
ordinary
london
house
but
the
carved
oak
furniture
and
tapestries
gave
dignity
to
the
long
and
pictures
and
books
lined
the
stairs
in
the
garden
at
the
back
dwelt
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
two
weird
gray
geese
with
quivering
silver
wings
and
long
throats
who
used
to
come
and
meet
their
master
hissing
and
fluttering
in
an
owl
for
browning
still
indulged
a
fantasy
of
his
own
in
the
choice
of
pets
was
the
light
of
our
house
as
a
letter
describes
this
bird
of
darkness
for
his
tameness
and
engaging
ways
the
bird
would
kiss
its
master
on
the
face
tweak
his
hair
and
if
one
said
poor
old
fellow
in
a
commiserating
voice
would
assume
a
sympathetic
air
of
depression
miss
barrett
lived
hard
by
in
delamere
terrace
with
her
on
sundays
browning
listened
at
bedford
chapel
to
the
sermons
of
a
preacher
thomas
jones
to
some
of
which
when
published
in
he
prefixed
an
introduction
the
welsh
was
a
man
of
humble
origin
possessed
of
a
natural
gift
of
eloquence
which
with
his
liberal
humanity
drew
browning
to
become
a
hearer
of
his
discourses
he
made
no
haste
to
give
the
public
a
new
volume
of
verse
mrs
browning
had
mentioned
to
a
correspondent
not
long
before
her
death
that
her
husband
had
then
a
considerable
body
of
lyrical
poetry
in
a
state
of
completion
an
invitation
to
accept
the
editorship
of
the
on
thackeray
retirement
was
after
some
hesitation
declined
he
was
now
partly
occupied
with
preparing
for
the
press
whatever
writings
by
his
wife
seemed
suitable
for
publication
in
he
issued
with
a
dedication
to
grateful
florence
her
in
her
christian
in
he
prepared
a
volume
of
selections
from
her
poems
and
had
the
happiness
of
knowing
that
the
number
of
her
readers
had
rather
increased
than
diminished
the
efforts
of
biographers
to
make
capital
out
of
the
incidents
of
her
life
and
to
publish
such
letters
of
hers
as
could
be
laid
hands
on
moved
him
to
transports
of
indignation
which
break
forth
in
a
letter
to
his
friend
miss
blagden
with
unmeasured
violence
what
he
felt
with
the
paws
of
these
blackguards
in
his
very
bowels
god
knows
beast
and
scamp
and
knave
and
fool
are
terms
hardly
strong
enough
to
relieve
his
wrath
such
sudden
whirls
of
extreme
rage
were
rare
yet
were
characteristic
of
browning
and
were
sometimes
followed
by
regret
for
his
own
distemperature
in
a
gratifying
task
was
laid
on
him
that
of
superintending
the
three
volume
edition
of
his
poetical
works
which
was
published
in
the
following
year
at
the
same
time
his
old
friend
forster
with
help
from
procter
was
engaged
in
preparing
the
first
and
the
best
of
the
several
selections
from
browning
poems
it
was
at
once
an
indication
of
the
growing
interest
in
his
writings
and
an
effective
means
towards
extending
their
influence
he
set
himself
steadily
to
work
out
what
was
in
him
he
waited
no
longer
upon
his
casual
moods
but
girded
his
loins
and
kept
his
lamp
constantly
lit
his
genius
such
as
it
was
this
was
the
field
given
him
to
till
and
he
must
see
that
it
bore
fruit
i
certainly
will
do
my
utmost
to
make
the
most
of
my
poor
self
before
i
die
so
he
wrote
in
there
were
gains
in
such
a
resolved
method
of
work
but
there
were
also
losses
a
man
of
so
active
a
mind
by
planting
himself
before
a
subject
could
always
find
something
to
say
but
it
might
happen
that
such
sheer
was
carried
on
by
plying
other
faculties
than
those
which
give
its
highest
value
to
poetry
in
the
late
summer
and
early
autumn
of
browning
in
company
with
his
son
was
among
the
pyrenees
at
green
pleasant
little
cambo
and
then
at
biarritz
crammed
he
says
with
gay
people
of
whom
i
know
nothing
but
their
outsides
the
sea
and
sands
were
more
to
his
liking
than
the
gay
people
he
had
with
him
one
book
and
no
other
a
euripides
in
which
he
read
vigorously
and
that
the
readings
were
fruitful
his
later
poetry
of
the
greek
drama
bears
witness
at
present
however
his
creative
work
lay
in
another
direction
the
whole
of
the
roman
murder
story
the
story
of
pompilia
and
guido
and
caponsacchi
he
describes
as
being
pretty
well
in
his
head
it
needed
a
long
process
of
evolution
before
the
murder
story
could
uncoil
its
sinuous
lengths
in
a
series
of
volumes
the
visit
to
a
wild
little
place
in
brittany
near
pornic
in
the
summer
of
a
visit
to
be
repeated
in
the
two
summers
immediately
succeeding
is
directly
connected
with
two
of
the
poems
of
the
story
of
and
the
landscape
details
of
lee
are
alike
derived
from
pornic
the
solitude
of
the
little
breton
hamlet
soothed
browning
spirit
the
good
stupid
and
dirty
people
of
the
village
were
seldom
visible
except
on
sunday
there
were
solitary
walks
of
miles
to
be
had
along
the
coast
fruit
and
milk
butter
and
eggs
in
abundance
and
these
were
browning
diet
i
feel
out
of
the
very
earth
sometimes
he
wrote
as
i
sit
here
at
the
window
such
a
soft
sea
and
such
a
mournful
wind
but
the
lulling
charm
of
the
place
which
though
so
different
brought
back
the
old
siena
mood
did
not
convert
him
into
an
idler
the
mornings
which
began
betimes
were
given
to
work
in
his
way
of
desperate
resolve
to
be
well
occupied
he
informs
miss
blagden
that
having
yesterday
written
a
poem
of
lines
he
means
to
keep
writing
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
with
the
spring
of
writes
mr
gosse
a
great
change
came
over
browning
habits
he
had
refused
all
invitations
into
society
but
now
of
evenings
after
he
had
put
his
boy
to
bed
the
solitude
weighed
intolerably
upon
him
he
told
the
present
writer
mr
gosse
long
afterwards
that
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
on
one
such
spring
night
in
that
this
mode
of
life
was
morbid
and
unworthy
and
then
and
there
he
determined
to
accept
for
the
future
every
suitable
invitation
which
came
to
him
accordingly
goes
on
mr
gosse
he
began
to
dine
out
and
in
the
process
of
time
he
grew
to
be
one
of
the
most
familiar
figures
of
the
age
at
every
and
place
of
refined
entertainment
in
london
this
however
was
a
slow
process
mrs
ritchie
refers
to
spoken
words
of
browning
which
declared
that
it
was
a
mere
chance
whether
he
should
live
in
the
london
house
that
he
had
taken
and
join
in
social
life
or
go
away
to
some
quiet
retreat
and
be
seen
no
more
it
was
in
a
modified
form
the
story
of
the
fervid
youth
grown
man
in
his
own
daniel
bartoli
who
in
his
desolation
after
the
death
of
his
lady
trembled
on
the
verge
of
monkhood
trick
of
cowl
and
taste
of
scourge
he
tried
then
kicked
not
at
the
pricks
perverse
but
took
again
for
better
or
for
worse
the
old
way
of
the
world
and
much
the
same
man
o
the
outside
fairly
played
life
game
probably
browning
had
come
to
understand
that
in
his
relation
to
the
past
he
was
not
more
loyal
in
solitude
than
he
might
be
in
society
it
was
indeed
the
manlier
loyalty
to
bear
his
full
part
in
life
and
as
to
his
art
he
felt
that
with
sufficient
leisure
to
encounter
the
labour
he
had
enjoined
upon
himself
it
mattered
little
whether
the
remaining
time
was
spent
in
a
cave
or
in
a
court
strength
may
encounter
the
seductions
either
of
the
hermitage
or
of
the
crowd
and
still
be
the
victor
strength
may
conclude
in
archelaos
court
and
yet
esteem
the
silken
company
so
much
for
aught
their
praise
or
blame
should
joy
or
grieve
strength
amid
crowds
as
late
in
solitude
may
lead
the
still
life
ply
the
wordless
task
one
can
not
prescribe
a
hygiene
to
poets
the
poet
of
passionate
contemplation
such
as
was
wordsworth
could
hardly
quicken
or
develop
his
peculiar
faculty
by
devotion
to
the
entertainments
of
successive
london
seasons
and
perhaps
it
is
not
certain
that
the
genius
of
browning
was
wholly
a
gainer
by
the
superficial
excitations
of
the
dinner
table
and
the
reception
room
but
the
truth
is
as
mrs
browning
had
observed
that
his
energy
was
not
exhausted
by
literary
work
and
that
it
preyed
upon
himself
if
no
means
of
escape
were
found
if
he
was
not
at
the
piano
or
shaping
clay
or
at
the
or
walking
fast
and
far
inward
disturbances
were
set
up
which
rent
and
frayed
his
mind
the
pleasures
of
society
both
fatigued
and
rested
browning
they
certainly
relieved
him
from
the
troubles
of
force
in
was
published
it
might
be
described
as
virtually
a
third
volume
of
and
and
yet
a
certain
change
of
tone
is
discernible
italy
is
no
longer
the
background
of
the
human
figures
there
is
perhaps
less
opulence
of
colour
less
of
the
manifold
joys
of
living
if
higher
points
in
the
life
of
the
spirit
are
not
touched
the
religious
feeling
has
more
of
inwardness
and
is
more
detached
from
external
historical
fact
than
it
had
ever
been
before
there
is
more
sense
of
resistance
to
and
victory
over
whatever
may
seem
adverse
to
the
life
of
the
soul
in
the
poems
which
deal
with
love
the
situations
and
postures
of
the
spirit
are
less
simple
and
are
sometimes
even
strained
the
fantastic
and
the
grotesque
occupy
a
smaller
place
a
plain
dignity
a
grave
solemnity
of
style
is
attained
in
passages
of
death
in
the
which
had
hardly
been
reached
before
yet
substantially
the
volume
is
a
continuation
of
the
poems
of
except
in
one
instance
where
tennyson
method
in
that
of
a
sequence
of
lyrics
is
adopted
the
methods
are
the
same
the
predominating
themes
of
and
love
art
religion
are
the
predominating
themes
of
a
slight
metrical
complication
the
internal
rhyme
in
the
second
line
of
each
stanza
of
aliter
and
in
the
third
line
of
the
quatrains
of
and
may
be
noted
as
indicating
browning
love
of
new
metrical
experiments
in
the
former
of
these
poems
the
experiment
can
not
be
called
a
success
the
clash
of
sounds
a
mass
of
brass
walked
and
talked
and
the
like
seems
too
much
as
if
an
accident
had
been
converted
into
a
rule
sludge
the
the
longest
piece
in
the
volume
has
been
already
noticed
the
story
of
the
poor
girl
of
pornic
as
browning
in
a
letter
calls
her
attracted
him
partly
because
it
presented
a
psychological
curiosity
partly
because
he
cared
to
paint
her
hair
in
words
gold
in
contrast
with
that
pallid
face
as
much
as
his
friend
rossetti
might
have
wished
to
display
a
like
splendour
with
the
strokes
of
his
brush
hair
such
a
wonder
of
flix
and
floss
freshness
and
fragrance
floods
of
it
too
gold
did
i
say
nay
gold
mere
dross
the
story
which
might
gratify
a
cynical
observer
of
human
nature
is
treated
by
browning
without
a
touch
of
cynicism
except
that
ascribed
to
the
priest
good
easy
man
who
has
lost
a
soul
and
gained
an
altar
a
saint
whose
legend
is
gruesome
enough
but
more
pathetic
than
gruesome
becomes
for
the
poet
an
involuntary
witness
of
the
christian
faith
and
a
type
of
the
mystery
of
moral
evil
but
the
psychological
contrasts
of
the
ambiguous
creature
and
the
visual
contrast
of
that
face
like
a
silver
wedge
the
yellow
wealth
are
of
more
worth
than
the
sermon
which
the
writer
preaches
in
exposition
of
his
tale
had
the
form
of
the
poem
been
favourite
dramatic
monologue
we
can
imagine
that
an
ingenious
apologia
convincing
at
least
to
could
have
been
offered
for
the
perversity
of
the
dying
girl
rifting
every
golden
tress
with
gold
no
poem
in
the
volume
of
is
connected
with
pictorial
art
unless
it
be
the
few
lines
entitled
lines
of
which
emily
patmore
the
poet
wife
was
the
subject
and
written
as
browning
seldom
wrote
for
the
mere
record
of
beauty
that
little
head
of
hers
is
transferred
to
browning
panel
in
the
manner
of
an
early
tuscan
piece
of
ideal
loveliness
in
purity
of
outline
and
of
colour
the
delicate
profile
the
opening
lips
the
neck
the
chin
so
naturally
ally
themselves
to
painting
that
nature
is
best
comprehended
through
its
imaginative
transference
to
art
as
of
the
earlier
collection
of
poems
converts
a
bewildering
technique
of
music
into
poetry
and
discovers
in
its
intricate
construction
a
certain
interposing
web
spun
by
the
brain
between
the
soul
and
things
divine
so
interprets
music
on
the
other
side
that
of
immediate
inspiration
to
which
the
constructive
element
real
though
slight
is
subordinate
in
the
silence
and
vacuity
which
follow
the
impromptu
on
his
orchestrion
the
composer
yearns
broods
aspires
never
were
a
ghostly
troop
of
sounds
reanimated
and
incarnated
into
industrious
life
more
actually
than
by
browning
verse
they
climb
and
crowd
they
mount
and
march
and
then
pass
away
but
the
musician
spirit
is
borne
onward
by
the
wind
of
his
own
mood
and
it
can
not
stay
its
flight
until
it
has
found
rest
in
god
all
that
was
actual
of
harmonious
sound
has
collapsed
but
the
sense
of
a
mystery
of
divine
suggestion
abides
in
his
heart
the
partial
beauty
becomes
a
pledge
of
beauty
in
its
plenitude
and
then
by
a
gentle
return
upon
himself
he
resumes
the
life
of
every
day
sobered
quieted
and
comforted
the
poem
touches
the
borderland
where
art
and
religion
meet
the
of
left
behind
as
its
relics
the
melancholy
of
mundane
pleasure
and
a
sense
of
its
transitory
existence
the
extemporising
of
fills
the
void
which
it
has
opened
with
the
substance
of
things
hoped
for
the
evidence
of
things
unseen
faith
victor
over
loss
in
is
victor
over
temporal
decay
in
ben
the
poem
is
the
song
of
triumph
of
devout
old
age
neither
the
shrunken
sadness
of
matthew
arnold
poem
on
old
age
nor
the
wise
moderation
and
acquiescence
in
the
economy
of
force
which
an
admirable
poem
by
emerson
expresses
can
be
found
here
and
perhaps
some
stress
and
strain
may
be
felt
in
browning
effort
to
maintain
his
position
it
is
no
vale
of
years
of
which
ben
tells
old
age
is
viewed
as
an
apex
a
pinnacle
from
which
in
thin
translucent
air
all
the
efforts
and
all
the
errors
of
the
past
can
be
reviewed
the
gifts
of
youth
the
gifts
of
the
flesh
are
not
depreciated
but
the
highest
attainment
is
that
of
knowledge
won
by
experience
knowledge
which
can
divide
good
from
evil
and
what
is
true
from
what
merely
seems
knowledge
which
can
put
a
just
valuation
not
only
on
deeds
but
on
every
faint
desire
and
unaccomplished
purpose
and
not
only
on
achievements
but
failures
possessed
of
such
knowledge
tried
in
the
probation
of
life
and
not
found
wanting
accepting
its
own
peculiar
trials
old
age
can
enter
into
the
rest
of
a
clear
and
solemn
vision
confident
of
being
qualified
at
last
to
start
forth
upon
that
adventure
brave
and
new
to
which
death
is
a
summons
and
assured
through
experience
that
the
power
which
gives
our
life
its
law
is
equalled
by
a
superintending
love
ardour
and
not
lethargy
progress
and
not
decline
are
here
represented
as
the
characteristics
of
extreme
old
age
an
enthusiasm
of
effort
and
of
strenuous
endurance
an
enthusiasm
of
rest
in
knowledge
an
enthusiasm
of
to
god
and
the
divine
purpose
make
up
the
poem
at
no
time
did
browning
write
verse
which
soars
with
a
more
steadfast
and
impassioned
libration
of
wing
death
in
ben
is
death
as
a
friend
in
the
lines
entitled
it
is
death
the
adversary
that
is
confronted
and
conquered
the
poem
is
an
act
of
the
faith
which
comes
through
love
it
is
ascribed
to
no
imaginary
speaker
and
does
not
indeed
veil
its
personal
character
no
lonely
adventure
is
here
to
reward
the
victor
over
death
the
transcendent
joy
is
human
love
recovered
which
being
once
recovered
let
whatever
god
may
please
succeed
the
verses
are
a
confession
which
gives
the
reason
of
that
gallant
beating
up
against
the
wind
noticeable
in
many
of
browning
later
poems
he
could
not
cease
from
hope
but
hope
and
faith
had
much
to
encounter
and
sometimes
he
would
reduce
the
grounds
of
his
hope
to
the
lowest
as
if
to
make
sure
against
illusion
and
to
test
the
fortitude
of
hope
even
at
its
weakest
the
hope
of
immortality
which
was
his
own
inevitably
extended
itself
beyond
himself
and
became
an
interpreter
of
the
mysteries
of
our
earthly
life
in
contrast
with
the
ardent
ideality
of
ben
may
be
set
the
uncompromising
realism
of
with
its
poetry
of
the
paris
morgue
the
lover
of
life
will
scrutinise
death
at
its
ugliest
and
worst
blinking
no
hideous
fact
yet
even
so
the
reverence
for
humanity
poor
men
god
made
and
all
for
that
is
not
quenched
nor
is
the
hope
quenched
that
after
last
returns
the
first
though
a
wide
compass
round
be
fetched
that
what
began
best
ca
end
worst
the
optimism
is
unreasoned
and
rightly
so
for
the
spirit
of
the
poem
with
its
suggestive
title
is
not
argumentative
the
sense
of
the
pity
of
it
in
one
heart
remorse
which
has
somehow
come
into
existence
out
of
the
obscure
storehouse
of
nature
or
out
of
god
is
the
only
justification
suggested
for
a
hope
that
nature
or
god
must
at
the
last
intend
good
and
not
evil
to
the
poor
defeated
abjects
who
most
abhorred
their
lives
in
paris
yesterday
and
the
word
nature
here
would
be
rejected
by
browning
as
less
than
the
truth
in
under
somewhat
altered
conditions
and
from
a
ground
somewhat
shifted
browning
in
death
in
the
and
the
to
dramatis
personae
continued
his
apology
for
the
christian
faith
the
apologetics
are
however
in
the
first
instance
poems
and
they
remain
poems
at
the
last
the
imaginary
scene
of
the
death
of
the
evangelist
john
is
rendered
with
the
finest
art
its
dignity
is
that
of
a
certain
noble
bareness
in
the
grotto
are
the
aged
disciple
and
the
little
group
of
witnesses
to
whom
he
utters
his
legacy
of
words
at
the
cave
edge
is
the
bactrian
crying
from
time
to
time
his
cry
of
assurance
outside
was
all
noon
and
the
burning
blue
the
slow
return
of
the
dying
man
to
consciousness
of
his
surroundings
is
as
true
as
if
it
were
studied
from
a
his
sudden
awakening
at
the
words
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
arrives
not
as
a
dramatic
surprise
but
as
the
simplest
surprise
of
nature
light
breaking
forth
before
sunset
the
chief
speaker
of
the
poem
is
chosen
because
the
argument
is
one
concerning
faith
that
comes
through
love
and
st
john
was
the
disciple
who
had
learnt
love
deepest
secrets
the
dialectic
proceeds
along
large
lines
which
have
only
the
subtlety
of
simplicity
the
verse
moves
gravely
tenderly
often
weighted
with
monosyllables
a
pondering
dwelling
verse
and
great
single
lines
arise
so
naturally
that
while
they
fill
the
mind
with
a
peculiar
power
they
are
felt
to
be
of
one
texture
with
the
whole
this
for
example
we
would
not
lose
the
last
of
what
might
happen
on
his
face
and
this
when
there
was
mid
sea
and
the
mighty
things
and
this
lie
bare
to
the
universal
prick
of
light
and
these
the
bactrian
was
but
a
wild
childish
man
and
could
not
write
nor
speak
but
only
loved
such
lines
however
are
made
to
be
read
the
faith
of
these
latter
days
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
first
century
and
is
not
the
same
the
story
and
the
teaching
of
christ
had
alike
one
end
to
plant
in
the
human
consciousness
the
assurance
of
divine
love
and
to
make
us
in
our
degree
conscious
partakers
of
that
love
where
love
is
there
is
christ
our
conceptions
of
god
are
relative
to
our
own
understanding
but
god
as
power
god
as
a
communicating
intelligence
god
as
love
father
son
and
spirit
is
the
utmost
that
we
can
conceive
of
things
above
us
let
us
now
put
that
knowledge
imperfect
though
it
may
be
to
use
power
intelligence
love
these
surround
us
everywhere
they
are
not
mere
projections
from
our
own
brain
or
hand
or
heart
and
by
us
they
are
inconceivable
otherwise
than
as
personal
attributes
the
historical
story
of
christ
is
not
lost
for
it
has
grown
into
a
larger
assurance
of
faith
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
linen
clothes
and
napkins
of
the
empty
sepulchre
christ
is
arisen
why
revert
to
discuss
miracles
the
work
of
miracles
whatever
they
may
have
been
was
long
ago
accomplished
the
knowledge
of
the
divine
love
its
appropriation
by
our
own
hearts
and
the
putting
forth
of
that
love
in
our
lives
such
for
us
is
the
christian
faith
such
is
the
work
of
christ
accomplishing
itself
in
humanity
at
the
present
time
and
the
christian
story
is
no
myth
but
a
reality
not
because
we
can
prove
true
the
beliefs
of
the
first
century
but
because
those
beliefs
contained
within
them
a
larger
and
more
enduring
belief
the
acorn
has
not
perished
because
it
has
expanded
into
an
oak
this
reduced
here
to
the
baldest
statement
is
in
substance
the
dying
testimony
of
browning
st
john
it
is
thrown
into
lyrical
form
as
his
own
testimony
in
the
to
the
volume
of
the
voices
of
singers
the
sound
of
the
trumpets
of
the
jewish
dedication
day
when
the
glory
of
the
lord
in
his
cloud
filled
his
house
have
fallen
silent
we
are
told
by
some
that
the
divine
face
known
to
early
christian
days
as
love
has
withdrawn
from
earth
for
ever
and
left
humanity
enthroned
as
its
sole
representative
oh
dread
succession
to
a
dizzy
post
sad
sway
of
sceptre
whose
mere
touch
appals
browning
reply
is
that
to
one
whose
eyes
are
rightly
informed
the
whole
of
nature
and
of
human
life
shows
itself
as
a
perpetual
mystery
of
providential
care
why
where
the
need
of
temple
when
the
walls
o
the
world
are
that
what
use
of
swells
and
falls
from
levites
choir
priests
cries
and
trumpet
calls
that
one
face
far
from
vanish
rather
grows
or
decomposes
but
to
recompose
become
my
universe
that
feels
and
knows
in
the
great
poem
of
ring
and
the
one
speaker
the
venerable
pope
like
st
john
of
death
in
the
has
almost
reached
the
term
of
a
long
life
he
is
absorbed
in
the
solemn
weighing
of
truth
and
falsehood
good
and
evil
his
soul
like
the
soul
of
the
dying
evangelist
lies
bare
to
the
universal
prick
of
light
he
if
any
of
the
speakers
in
that
sequence
of
monologues
expresses
browning
own
highest
thought
and
the
pope
exposition
of
the
christianity
of
our
modern
age
is
identical
with
that
of
john
mind
is
but
a
convex
glass
in
which
is
represented
all
that
by
us
can
be
conceived
of
god
our
known
unknown
the
pope
has
heard
the
christian
story
which
is
abroad
in
the
world
he
loves
it
and
finds
it
credible
god
power
that
is
clearly
discernible
in
the
universe
his
intelligence
that
is
no
less
evidently
present
what
of
love
the
dread
machinery
of
sin
and
sorrow
on
this
globe
of
ours
seems
to
negative
the
idea
of
divine
love
the
surmise
of
immortality
may
indeed
justify
the
ways
of
god
to
man
this
dread
machinery
may
be
needed
to
evolve
highest
moral
qualities
the
acknowledgment
of
god
in
christ
the
divine
of
love
for
the
pope
as
for
st
john
solves
all
questions
in
the
earth
and
out
of
it
but
whether
the
truth
of
the
early
centuries
be
an
absolute
historic
fact
or
only
truth
reverberate
changed
made
pass
a
spectrum
into
mind
the
narrow
eye
the
same
and
not
the
same
else
unconceived
the
pope
dare
not
affirm
nor
does
he
regard
the
question
as
of
urgent
importance
at
the
present
day
the
effect
of
the
christian
tale
historic
fact
or
higher
fact
expressed
in
myth
remains
so
my
heart
be
struck
what
care
i
by
god
gloved
hand
or
the
bare
by
some
means
means
divinely
chosen
even
if
but
a
child
we
have
got
our
truth
and
it
suffices
for
our
training
here
on
earth
let
us
give
over
the
endless
task
of
unproving
and
the
already
proved
rather
let
us
straightway
put
our
truth
to
its
proper
uses
if
the
grotesque
occupies
a
comparatively
small
place
in
the
example
given
is
of
capital
importance
in
this
province
of
browning
art
the
devil
of
notre
dame
looking
down
on
paris
is
more
effectively
placed
but
is
hardly
a
more
impressive
invention
of
gothic
fantasy
than
caliban
sprawling
in
the
pit
much
mire
with
elbows
wide
fists
clenched
to
prop
his
chin
while
he
discourses
with
a
consciousness
itself
in
the
mire
and
scarcely
yet
pawing
to
get
free
concerning
the
nature
of
his
creator
the
grotesque
here
is
not
merely
of
the
kind
that
addresses
the
eye
the
poem
is
an
experiment
in
the
grotesque
of
thought
and
yet
fantastic
as
it
seems
the
whole
process
of
this
monstrous
bridgewater
treatise
is
governed
by
a
certain
logic
the
poem
indeed
is
essentially
a
fragment
of
browning
own
christian
apologetics
it
stands
as
a
burly
from
which
boiling
pitch
can
be
flung
upon
the
heads
of
assailants
the
poet
intention
is
not
at
all
to
give
us
a
chapter
in
the
origins
of
religion
nor
is
caliban
a
representative
of
primitive
man
a
frequently
recurring
idea
with
browning
is
that
expressed
by
pope
innocent
in
the
passage
already
cited
the
external
world
proves
the
power
of
god
it
proves
his
intelligence
but
the
proof
of
love
is
derived
exclusively
from
the
love
that
lives
in
the
heart
of
man
are
you
dissatisfied
with
such
a
proof
well
then
see
what
a
god
we
can
construct
out
of
intelligence
and
power
with
love
left
out
if
this
world
is
not
a
place
of
trial
and
training
appointed
by
love
then
it
is
a
scene
of
capricious
cruelty
or
capricious
indifference
on
the
part
of
our
maker
his
providence
is
a
wanton
sporting
with
our
weakness
and
our
misery
why
were
we
brought
into
being
to
amuse
his
solitary
and
weary
intelligence
and
to
become
the
victims
or
the
indulged
manifestations
of
his
power
why
is
one
man
selected
for
extreme
agony
from
which
a
score
of
his
fellows
escape
because
god
setebos
resembles
caliban
when
through
mere
caprice
he
lets
twenty
crabs
march
past
him
unhurt
and
stones
the
loving
not
hating
not
just
choosing
so
if
any
of
the
phenomena
of
nature
lead
us
to
infer
or
imagine
some
law
superior
to
the
idle
artistry
and
reckless
will
of
setebos
that
law
is
surely
very
far
away
it
is
the
quiet
of
caliban
theology
which
takes
no
heed
of
human
life
and
has
for
its
outposts
the
cold
unmoving
stars
except
the
short
piece
named
and
which
like
poem
of
the
is
founded
upon
one
of
those
freaks
of
association
that
make
some
trival
object
the
special
remembrancer
of
sorrow
the
remaining
poems
of
as
originally
published
are
all
poems
of
love
skilfully
contrived
in
the
indirect
directness
of
its
acknowledgment
of
love
its
jealous
privacy
of
passion
and
its
irresistible
delight
in
the
homage
rendered
by
one
who
is
not
a
lover
is
no
exception
not
one
of
these
poems
tells
of
the
full
assurance
and
abiding
happiness
of
lovers
but
the
warmth
and
sweetness
of
early
passion
are
alive
under
the
most
disastrous
circumstances
in
the
apothecary
with
his
bottles
provides
a
chart
of
the
scene
of
the
adventures
the
professional
gravities
of
the
parson
put
an
edge
on
the
memory
of
the
dear
indiscretions
summer
distillation
to
borrow
a
word
from
shakespeare
makes
faint
the
odour
of
the
bottle
labelled
ether
the
mummy
wheat
from
the
coffin
of
old
desire
sprouts
up
and
waves
its
green
pennons
and
may
be
placed
beside
the
earlier
as
two
pages
out
of
the
history
of
the
encounters
of
prudence
and
passion
youth
and
maiden
alike
and
prefer
the
prudence
of
worldly
success
to
the
infinite
prudence
of
love
and
they
have
their
reward
that
success
in
life
which
is
failure
like
the
tedious
brief
scene
of
young
pyramus
and
thisbe
this
is
a
poem
of
very
tragical
mirth
and
no
less
tragically
mirthful
is
aliter
a
variation
on
the
same
or
a
kindred
theme
where
our
young
bohemian
sculptor
is
replaced
by
the
elderly
poet
bent
wigged
and
lamed
but
sure
of
the
fortieth
chair
in
the
academy
and
the
lone
of
the
by
a
young
beauty
who
adds
to
her
other
attractions
a
vague
uninstructed
yearning
for
culture
and
entirely
substantial
possessions
in
the
but
the
moral
is
the
same
the
folly
of
being
overwise
the
wisdom
of
acting
upon
the
best
promptings
of
the
heart
in
browning
attempts
to
render
a
mood
of
passionate
despair
love
and
the
hopes
of
love
are
defeated
by
a
woman
sentence
of
rejection
her
marriage
and
last
her
death
it
reads
more
than
any
other
poem
of
the
writer
like
a
leaf
torn
out
of
wuthering
heights
there
is
a
fixity
of
grief
which
is
more
appalling
than
this
whirlblast
the
souls
that
are
wedged
in
ice
occupy
a
lower
circle
in
the
region
of
sorrow
than
those
which
are
driven
before
the
gale
worst
of
another
poem
of
the
failures
of
love
reverses
the
conventional
attitude
of
the
wronged
husband
he
ought
according
to
all
recognised
authorities
of
drama
and
novel
rage
against
his
faithless
wife
and
commiserate
his
virtuous
self
here
he
endeavours
though
vainly
to
transfer
every
stain
and
shame
to
himself
from
her
his
anguish
is
all
on
her
behalf
or
if
on
his
own
chiefly
because
he
can
not
restore
her
purity
or
save
her
from
her
wrong
done
against
herself
it
is
a
poem
of
moral
stress
and
strain
imagined
with
great
intensity
browning
in
general
isolates
a
single
moment
or
mood
of
passion
and
studies
it
with
its
shifting
lights
and
shadows
as
a
living
microcosm
often
it
is
a
moment
of
crisis
a
moment
of
culmination
for
once
in
lee
named
in
the
first
edition
by
a
stroke
of
perversity
he
represents
in
a
sequence
of
lyrics
a
sequence

the
season
of
the
year
is
autumn
and
autumn
as
felt
not
among

wheatfields

on
a
barren
and
rocky
the
processes
of
the
declining
year
from
the
first
touch
of
change
to
bareness
everywhere
accompany
and
accord
with
those
of
the
decline
of
hope
in
the
wife
heart
for
any
return
of
her
love
her
offence
is
that
she
has
loved
too
well
that
she
has
laid
upon
her
husband
too
great
a
load
of
devotion
hostility
might
be
met
and
vanquished
but
how
can
she
deal
with
a
heart
which
love
itself
only
petrifies
it
should
be
a
warning
to
critics
who
translate
dramatic
poems
into
imaginary
biography
to
find
that
browning
who
had
known
so
perfect
a
success
in
the
one
love
of
his
life
should
constantly
present
in
work
of
imagination
the
ill
fortunes
of
love
and
lovers
looking
a
little
below
the
surface
we
see
that
he
could
not
write
directly
he
could
not
speak
effusively
of
the
joy
that
he
had
known
but
in
all
these
poems
he
thinks
of
love
as
a
supreme
possession
in
itself
and
as
a
revelation
of
infinite
things
which
lie
beyond
it
as
a
test
of
character
and
even
as
a
pledge
of
perpetual
advance

the

in

noticed
with
regret
that
the

where
the

of

was
disappearing

some

happening
in

browning
father
kind
and
cheery
old
man
was
unwell
in
june
miss
browning
telegraphed
for
her
brother
and
he
arrived
in
paris
hours
before
the
end
the
elder
browning
had
almost
completed
his
year
to
the
last
he
retained
what
his
son
described
as
his
own
strange
sweetness
of
soul
it
was
the
close
of
a
useful
unworldly
unambitious
life
full
of
innocent
enjoyment
and
deep
affection
the
occasion
was
not
one
for
intemperate
grief
but
the
sense
of
loss
was
great
miss
browning
whose
devotion
during
many
years
first
to
her
mother
then
to
her
widowed
father
had
been
entire
now
became
her
brother
constant
companion
they
rested
for
the
summer
at
le
croisic
a
little
town
in
brittany
in
a
delightfully
spacious
old
house
with
the
sea
to
right
and
left
through
whose
great
rushing
waves
browning
loved
to
battle
and
inland
a
wild
country
picturesque
with
its
villagers
their
enjoyment
was
unspoilt
even
by
some
weeks
of
disagreeable
weather
and
to
the
same
place
which
browning
has
described
in
his
poets
of
croisic
the
spit
of
sandy
rock
which
juts
spitefully
north
they
returned
in
the
following
summer
during

second
visit
september
that
most
spirited
ballad
of
french
heroism
was
written
though
its
publication
belongs
to
four
years
later
in
june
came
grief
of
a
kind
that
seemed
to
cut
him
off
from
outward
communication
with
a
portion
of
what
was
most
precious
in
his
past
life
arabel
barrett
his
wife
only
surviving
sister
who
had
supported
him
in
his
greatest
sorrow
died
in
browning
arms
for
many
years
we
are
told
by
mr
gosse
he
was
careful
never
to
pass
her
house
in
delamere
terrace
although
not
prone
to
superstition
he
had
noted
in
july
a
dream
of
miss
barrett
in
which
she
imagined
herself
asking
her
dead
sister
elizabeth
when
shall
i
be
with
you
and
received
the
answer
dearest
in
five
years
only
a
coincidence
he
adds
in
a
letter
to
miss
blagden
but
noticeable
that
summer
after
wanderings
in
france
browning
and
his
sister
settled
at
audierne
on
the
extreme
westerly
point
of
brittany
a
delightful
quite
unspoiled
little
fishing
town
with
the
ocean
in
front
and
green
lanes
and
hills
behind
it
was
in
every
way
an
eventful
year
in
the
autumn
his
new
publishers
smith
elder
produced
the
edition
of
his
poetical
works
on
the
of
which
the
author
describes
himself
as
robert
browning
honorary
fellow
of
balliol
college
oxford
the
distinction
partly
due
to
jowett
influence
had
been
conferred
a
year
previously
in
browning
who
desired
that
his
son
should
be
educated
at
oxford
first
became
acquainted
with
jowett
acquaintance
quickly
ripened
into
friendship
which
was
not
the
less
genuine
or
cordial
because
jowett
had
but
a
qualified
esteem
for
browning
poems
ought
one
to
admire
one
friend
poetry
was
a
difficult
question
of
casuistry
which
the
master
of
balliol
at
one
time
proposed
much
of
browning
work
appeared
to
him
to
be
extravagant
perverse
there
is
no
rest
in
him
jowett
wrote
with
special
reference
to
the
poems
christmas
eve
and
easter
day
which
he
regarded
as
browning
noblest
work
but
for
the
man
his
admiration
was
and
substantial
after
browning
first
visit
to
him
in
june
jowett
wrote
that
though
getting
too
old
to
make
as
he
supposed
new
friends
he
had
he
believed
made
one
it
is
impossible
to
speak
without
enthusiasm
of
mr
browning
open
generous
nature
and
his
great
ability
and
knowledge
i
had
no
idea
that
there
was
a
perfectly
sensible
poet
in
the
world
entirely
free
from
vanity
jealousy
or
any
other
littleness
and
thinking
no
more
of
himself
than
any
ordinary
man
his
great
energy
is
very
remarkable
and
his
determination
to
make
the
most
of
the
remainder
of
life
of
personal
objects
he
seems
to
have
none
except
the
education
of
his
son
browning
visits
to
oxford
and
cambridge
did
not
cease
when
he
dropped
away
from
the
round
of
visiting
at
country
houses
he
writes
with
frank
enjoyment
of
the
almost
interminable
banquet
given
at
balliol
in
the
lent
term
on
the
occasion
of
the
opening
of
the
new
hall
oxford
conferred
upon
him
her
in
on
which
occasion
a
happy
undergraduate
jester
sent
fluttering
towards
the
new
doctor
head
an
appropriate
allusion
in
the
form
of
a
red
cotton
the
cambridge
was
conferred
in
in
he
was
elected
a
life
governor
of
the
university
of
london
in
he
was
invited
to
stand
with
the
certainty
of
election
for
the
lord
rectorship
of
the
university
of
st
andrews
as
successor
to
john
stuart
mill
an
honour
which
he
declined
the
great
event
of
this
year
in
the
history
of
his
authorship
was
the
publication
in
november
and
december
of
the
first
two
volumes

two
remaining

which
contained
the
crude
fact
from
which
his
poem
of
the
franceschini
murder
case
was
developed
the
price
was
a
lira
eightpence
english
just
as
he
leaned
by
the
fountain
and
walked
through
street
and
street
he
read
and
had
mastered
the
contents
before
his
foot
was
on
the
threshold
of
casa
guidi
that
night
his
brain
was
pacing
the
terrace
of
casa
guidi
while
from
felice
church
opposite
came
the
clear
voice
of
the
cloistered
ones
chanting
a
chant
made
for
nights
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
excitement
of
the
actors
and
their
deeds
in
his
imagination
i
fused
my
live
soul
and
that
inert
stuff
before
attempting
smithcraft
according
to
mr
rudolf
lehmann
but
possibly
he
has
antedated
the
incident
browning
at
once
conceived
the
mode
in
which
the
subject
could
be
treated
in
poetry
and
it
was
precisely
the
mode
which
was
afterwards
adopted
i
had
read
the
book
so
browning
told
me
plan
was
at
once
settled
i
went
for
a
walk
gathered
twelve
pebbles
from
the
road
and
put
them
at
equal
distances
on
the
parapet
that
bordered
it
those
represented
the
twelve
chapters
into
which
the
poem
is
divided
and
i
adhered
to
that
arrangement
to
the
last
when
in
the
autumn
he
journeyed
with
his
wife
to
rome
the
quarto
was
with
him
but
the
persons
from
whom
he
sought
further
light
about
the
murder
and
the
trial
could
give
little
information
or
none
smithcraft
did
not
soon
begin
he
offered
the
story
for
prose
treatment
to
miss
ogle
so
we
are
informed
by
mrs
orr
and
she
adds
but
with
less
assurance
of
statement
offered
it
for
poetic
use
to
one
of
his
leading
contemporaries
we
have
seen
that
in
a
letter
of
from
biarritz
browning
speaks
of
the
roman
murder
case
as
being
the
subject
of
a
new
poem
already
clearly
conceived
though
unwritten
in
the
last
section
of
ring
and
the
he
refers
to
having
been
in
close
converse
with
his
old
quarto
of
the
piazza
san
lorenzo
during
four
years
how
will
it
be
my
intimate
when
thou
and
i
part
company
anon
the
publication
of
in
doubtless
enabled
browning
to
give
undivided
attention
to
his
vast
design
in
october
of
that
year
he
advanced
to
actual
definition
of
his
scheme
when
staying
in
the
south
of
france
he
visited
the
mountain
gorge
which
is
connected
with
the
adventure
of
the
roland
of
romance
and
there
he
planned
the
whole
poem
precisely
as
it
was
carried
out
he
says
mr
rossetti
enters
in
his
diary
after
a
conversation
with
browning
march
he
writes
day
by
day
on
a
regular
systematic
plan
some
three
hours
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
he
seldom
or
never
unless
in
quite
brief
poems
feels
the
inspiring
impulse
and
sets
the
thing
down
into
words
at
the
same
time
often
stores
up
a
subject
long
before
he
writes
it
he
has
written
his
forthcoming
work
all
consecutively
not
some
of
the
later
parts
before
the
earlier
when
carlyle
met
browning
after
the
appearance
of
ring
and
the
he
desired
to
be
complimentary
but
was
hardly
more
felicitous
than
browning
himself
had
sometimes
been
when
under
a
like
necessity
it
is
a
wonderful
book
declared
carlyle
one
of
the
most
wonderful
poems
ever
written
i
it
all
through
all
made
out
of
an
old
bailey
story
that
might
have
been
told
in
ten
lines
and
only
wants
forgetting
a
like
remark
might
have
been
made
respecting
the
book
which
in
its
method
and
its
range
of
all
english
books
most
resembles
browning
poem
and
which
may
indeed
be
said
to
take
among
prose
works
of
fiction
a
similar
place
to
that
held
among
poetical
creations
by
browning
tale
of
guido
and
pompilia
richardson
consists
of
eight
volumes
made
out
of
an
old
bailey
story
or
what
might
have
been
such
which
one
short
newspaper
paragraph
could
have
dismissed
to
a
happy
or
sorrowful
oblivion
but
then
we
should
never
have
known
two
of
the
most
impressive
figures
invented
by
the
imagination
of
man
clarissa
and
her
wronger
and
had
we
not
heard
their
story
from
all
the
participators
and
told
with
richardson
characteristic
interest
in
the
microscopy
of
the
human
heart
it
could
never
have
possessed
our
minds
with
that
full
sense
of
its
reality
which
is
the
experience
of
every
reader
out
of
the
infinitesimally
little
emerges
what
is
great
out
of
the
transitory
moments
rise
the
forms
that
endure
it
is
of
little
profit
to
discuss
the
question
whether
richardson
could
have
effected
his
purpose
in
four
volumes
instead
of
eight
or
whether
browning
ought
to
have
contented
himself
with
ten
thousand
lines
of
verse
instead
of
twenty
thousand
no
one
probably
has
said
of
either
work
that
it
is
too
short
and
many
have
uttered
the
sentence
of
the
critical
polonius
this
is
too
long
but
neither
nor
ring
and
the
is
one
of
the
hundred
merry
tales
the
purpose
of
each
writer
is
triumphantly
effected
and
while
we
wish
that
the
same
effect
could
have
been
produced
by
means
less
elaborate
it
is
not
safe
to
assert
confidently
that
this
was
possible
it
has
often
been
said
that
the
story
is
told
ten
times
over
by
almost
as
many
speakers
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
that
the
story
is
not
told
even
once
nine
different
speakers
tell
nine
different
stories
stories
of
varying
incidents
about
different
persons
for
the
pompilia
of
guido
and
the
pompilia
of
caponsacchi
are
as
remote
each
from
other
as
a
from
a
star
and
so
with
the
rest
in
the
end
we
are
left
to
invent
the
story
for
ourselves
not
indeed
without
sufficient
guidance
towards
the
truth
of
things
since
the
successive
speeches
are
a
discipline
in
distinguishing
the
several
values
of
human
testimony
we
become
familiar
with
idols
of
the

idols

shall
recognise
them
if
we
meet
them
again
gossipry
on
this
side
is
checked
and
controlled
by
gossipry
on
that
and
the
nicely
balanced
indifferentism
of
men
emasculate
blank
of
belief
who
play
with
the
realities
of
life
is
set
forth
with
its
superior
foolishness
of
wisdom
the
advocacy
which
consists
of
professional
is
exhibited
genially
humorously
an
advocacy
to
the
truth
of
its
own
case
to
every
truth
indeed
save
one
that
which
commends
the
advocate
himself
his
ingenious
wit
and
his
flowers
of
rhetoric
the
criminal
is
allowed
his
due
portion
of
veracity
and
his
fragment
of
truth
what
shall
a
man
give
for
his
life
he
has
enough
truth
to
enable
him
to
fold
a
cloud
across
the
light
to
wrench
away
the
and
reverse
their
pointing
hands
to
remove
the
to
set
up
false
signal
fires
upon
the
rocks
and
then
are
heard
three
successive
voices
each
of
which
and
each
in
a
different
way
brings
to
our
mind
the
words
but
there
is
a
spirit
in
man
and
the
inspiration
of
the
almighty
giveth
them
understanding
first
the
voice
of
the
pure
passion
of
manhood
which
is
naked
and
unashamed
a
voice
terrible
in
its
sincerity
absolute
in
its
abandonment
to
truth
in
its
carelessness
of
personal
consequences
its
carelessness
of
all
except
the
deliverance
of
a
message
and
yet
withal
a
courtly
voice
and
if
it
please
ironical
it
is
as
if
elihu
the
son
of
barachel
stood
up
and
his
wrath
were
kindled
behold
my
belly
is
as
wine
which
hath
no
vent
it
is
ready
to
burst
like
new
bottles
i
will
speak
that
i
may
be
refreshed
and
yet
we
dare
not
say
that
caponsacchi
truth
is
the
whole
truth
he
speaks
like
a
man
newly
converted
still
astonished
by
the
supernatural
light
and
inaccessible
to
many
things
visible
in
the
light
of
common
day
next
a
voice
from
one
who
is
human
indeed
to
the
of
the
heart
but
who
is
already
withdrawn
from
all
the
turbulence
and
turbidity
of
life
the
voice
of
a
woman
who
is
still
a
child
of
a
mother
who
is
still
virginal
of
primitive
instinct
which
comes
from
god
and
spiritual
desire
kindled
by
that
saintly
knighthood
that
had
saved
her
a
voice
from
the
edge
of
the
world
where
the
dawn
of
another
world
has
begun
to
tremble
and
grow
luminous
uttering
its
fragment
of
the
truth
last
the
voice
of
old
age
and
authority
and
matured
experience
and
divine
illumination
old
age
encompassed
by
much
doubt
and
weariness
and
human
infirmity
a
solemn
pondering
voice
which
with
god
somewhere
in
the
goes
sounding
on
a
dim
and
perilous
way
until
in
a
moment
this
voice
of
the
anxious
explorer
for
truth
changes
to
the
voice
of
the
unalterable
justicer
the
armed
doomsman
of
righteousness
truth
absolute
is
not
attained
by
any
one
of
the
speakers
that
browning
would
say
is
the
concern
of
god
and
so
at
the
close
we
are
directed
to
take
to
heart
the
lesson
that
our
human
speech
is
naught
our
human
testimony
false
our
fame
and
human
estimation
words
and
wind
but
there
are
degrees
of
approximation
to
truth
and
of
remoteness
from
it
truth
as
apprehended
by
pure
passion
truth
as
apprehended
by
simplicity
of
soul
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
truth
as
apprehended
by
spiritual
experience
such
respectively
make
up
the
substance
of
the
monologues
of
caponsacchi
of
pompilia
and
of
the
pope
for
the
valuation
however
of
this
loftier
testimony
we
require
a
sense
of
the
level
ground
even
if
it
be
the
a
perception
of
the
heights
must
be
given
by
exhibiting
the
plain
if
we
were
carried
up
in
the
air
and
heard
these
voices
how
should
we
know
for
certain
that
we
had
not
become
inhabitants
of
some
cloudcuckootown
and
the
plain
is
where
we
ordinarily
live
and
move
it
has
its
rights
and
is
worth
understanding
for
its
own
sake
therefore
we
shall
mix
our
mind
with
that
of
and
the
other
before
we
climb
any
mounts
of
transfiguration
or
enter
any
city
set
upon
a
hill
the
man
in
the
street
is
a
veritable
person
and
it
is
good
that
we
should
make
his
acquaintance
even
the
man
in
the
may
speak
his
mind
if
he
will
such
shallow
excitements
such
idle
curiosities
as
theirs
will
enable
us
better
to
appreciate
the
upheaval
to
the
depths
in
the
heart
of
caponsacchi
the
quietude
and
the
rapt
joy
in
quietude
of
pompilia
the
profound
searchings
of
spirit
that
proceed
all
through
the
droop
of
that
sombre
february
day
in
the
closet
of
the
pope
and
then
at
the
most
tragic
moment
and
when
pathos
is
most
poignant
life
goes
on
and
the
world
is
wide
and
laughter
is
not
banished
from
earth
therefore
dominus
hyacinthus
de
archangelis
procurator
of
the
poor
shall
make
his
ingenious
notes
for
the
defence
of
count
guido
and
cite
his
precedents
and
quote
his
authorities
and
darken
counsel
with
words
all
to
be
by
and
by
ecclesiasticized
and
regularized
and
latinized
and
ciceroized
while
more
than
half
the
good
man
mind
is
occupied
with
thought
of
the
imminent
lovesome
frolic
feast
on
his
boy
which
shall
bring
with
it
lamb
fry
and
liver
stung
out
of
its
monotony
of
richness
by
and
fennel
yes
and
we
shall
hear
also
the
other
side
how
in
a
florilegium
of
latin
selected
to
honour
aright
the
graces
and
the
muses
and
the
majesty
of
law
bottinius
can
do
justice
to
his
client
and
to
his
own
genius
by
showing
with
due
exordium
and
argument
and
peroration
that
pompilia
is
all
that
her
worst
adversaries
allege
and
yet
can
be
established
innocent
or
not
so
very
guilty
by
her
learning
and
legal
deftness
in
quart
and
tierce
the
secondary
personages
in
richardson
clarissa
grow
somewhat
faint
in
our
memories
but
the
figures
of
his
heroine
and
of
lovelace
remain
not
only
uneffaceable
but
undimmed
by
time
four
of
the
of
browning
poem
in
like
manner
possess
an
enduring
life
which
shows
no
decline
or
abatement
after
the
effect
of
the
monologues
by
the
other
speakers
has
been
produced
and
the
speakers
themselves
almost
forgotten
count
guide
franceschini
is
not
a
miracle
of
evil
rendered
credible
like
shakespeare
iago
nor
a
strange
enormity
of
tyrannous
hate
and
lust
like
the
count
cenci
of
shelley
he
has
no
spirit
of
diabolic
revelry
in
crime
no
feeling
for
its
delicate
artistry
he
is
under
no
spell
of
fascination
derived
from
its
horror
he
is
clumsy
in
his
fraud
and
coarse
in
his
violence
sin
may
have
its
strangeness
in
beauty
but
guido
does
not
gleam
with
the
romance
of
sin
if
browning
once
or
twice
gives
his
fantasy
play
it
is
in
describing
the
black
cave
of
a
palace
at
arezzo
into
which
the
white
pompilia
is
borne
the
cave
and
its
denizens
the
gaunt
gray
nightmare
of
a
mother
mopping
and
mowing
in
the
dusk
the
brothers
two
obscure
goblin
creatures
this
the
other
with
guido
himself
as
the
main
monster
yet
the
count
short
of
stature
and
yellow
in
a
bush
of
beard
is
not
a
monster
but
a
man
possessed
of
intellectual
ability
and
a
certain
grace
of
bearing
when
occasion
requires
although
wrenched
and
enfeebled
by
the
torture
of
the
rack
he
holds
his
ground
has
even
a
little
irony
to
spare
and
makes
a
skilful
defence
browning
does
not
need
a
lithe
beautiful
mysterious
human
panther
and
is
content
with
a
plain
prosaic
serviceable
villain
who
would
have
been
disdained
by
the
genius
of
the
dramatist
webster
as
wanting
in
romance
but
like
some
of
webster
saturnine
fantastic
assistants
or
tools
in
crime
guido
has
failed
in
everything
is
no
longer
young
chews
upon
the
bitter
root
of
failure
and
is
by
its
acrid
juices
he
is
godless
in
an
age
of
godless
living
cynical
in
a
cynical
generation
and
ever
and
anon
he
betrays
the
licentious
imagination
of
an
age
of
license
he
plays
a
poor
part
in
the
cruel
farce
of
life
and
snarls
against
the
world
while
clinging
desperately
to
the
world
and
to
life
a
disinterested
loyalty
to
the
powers
of
evil
might
display
a
certain
gallantry
of
its
own
but
though
guido
loathes
goodness
his
devotion
to
evil
has
no
inverted
chivalry
in
it
there
is
always
a
valid
reason
a
sordid
motive
for
his
rage
and
in
truth
he
has
grounds
of
complaint
which
a
wave
of
generous
passion
would
have
swept
away
but
which
following
upon
the
ill
successes
of
his
life
might
well
make
a
bad
man
mad
his
wife
palmed
off
upon
the
representative
of
an
ancient
and
noble
house
is
the
child
of
a
nameless
father
and
a
common
harlot
of
rome
she
is
repelled
by
his
person
and
her
cold
submission
to
what
she
has
been
instructed
in
by
the
archbishop
as
the
duties
of
a
wife
is
more
intolerable
than
her
earlier
remoter
aversion
he
is
cheated
of
the
dowry
which
lured
him
to
marriage
he
is
pointed
at
with
smiling
scorn
by
the
gossips
of
arezzo
a
gallant
of
the
troop
of
satan
might
have
devised
and
executed
some
splendid
revenge
but
guido
is
ever
among
the
sutlers
and
of
the
fiend
who
are
base
before
they
are
bold
when
he
makes
his
final
pleading
for
life
in
the
cell
of
the
new
prison
by
castle
angelo
the
animal
cry
like
that
of
a
wild
cat
on
whom
the
teeth
of
the
trap
have
closed
is
rendered
shrill
by
the
intensity
of
imagination
with
which
he
pictures
to
himself
the
apparatus
of
the
scaffold
and
the
hideous
circumstance
of
his
death
his
effort
as
far
as
it
is
rational
is
to
transfer
the
guilt
of
his
deeds
to
anyone
or
everyone
but
himself
when
all
other
resources
fail
he
boldly
lays
the
offence
upon
god
who
has
made
him
what
he
is
it
was
a
fine
audacity
of
browning
in
imagining
the
last
desperate
shriek
of
the
wretched
man
uttered
as
the
brotherhood
of
death
descend
the
stairs
singing
their
accursed
psalm
to
carry
the
climax
of
appeal
to
the
powers
of
charity
christ
maria
god
one
degree
farther
and
make
the
murderer
last
of
all
cry
upon
his
victim
to
be
his
saviour
from
the
death
which
he
dares
to
name
by
the
name
of
his
own
crime
a
name
which
that
crime
might
seem
to
have
sequestered
from
all
other
uses
pompilia
will
you
let
them
murder
me
pompilia
is
conceived
by
browning
not
as
a
pale
passive
victim
but
as
strong
with
a
vivid
interior
life
and
not
more
perfect
in
patience
than
in
her
obedience
to
the
higher
law
which
summons
her
to
resistance
to
evil
and
championship
of
the
right
her
purity
is
not
the
purity
of
ice
but
of
fire
when
the
pope
would
find
for
himself
a
symbol
to
body
forth
her
soul
it
is
not
a
lily
that
he
thinks
of
but
a
rose
others
may
yield
to
the
eye
of
god
a
timid
leaf
and
an
uncertain
bud
while
see
how
this
mere
chance
sown
seed
that
sprang
up
by
the
wayside
the
foot
of
the
enemy
this
breaks
all
into
blaze
spreads
itself
one
wide
glory
of
desire
to
incorporate
the
whole
great
sun
it
loves
from
the
whence
it
looks
and
longs
my
flower
my
rose
i
gather
for
the
breast
of
god
as
she
lies
on
her
pallet
dying
in
the
good
house
that
helps
the
poor
to
die
she
is
far
withdrawn
from
the
things
of
time
her
life
with
all
its
pleasures
and
its
pains
seems
strange
and
far
away
looks
old
fantastic
and
impossible
i
touch
a
fairy
thing
that
fades
and
fades
two
possessions
out
of
what
life
has
brought
remain
with
her
the
babe
who
while
yet
unborn
had
converted
her
from
a
sufferer
to
a
defender
and
the
friend
who
has
saved
her
soul
even
motherhood
itself
is
not
the
deepest
thing
in
pompilia
nature
the
little
gaetano
whom
she
had
held
in
her
arms
for
three
days
will
change
he
will
grow
great
strong
stern
a
tall
young
man
who
can
not
guess
what
she
was
like
who
may
some
day
have
some
hard
thought
of
her
he
too
withdraws
into
the
dream
of
earth
she
can
never
lose
him
and
yet
lose
him
she
surely
must
all
she
can
do
is
by
dying
to
give
him
to
god
without
a
further
care
so
to
be
safe
but
one
experience
of
life
was
quite
out
of
time
and
belongs
by
its
mere
essence
to
eternity
having
laid
her
babe
away
with
god
she
must
not
even
think
of
him
again
for
gratitude
and
her
last
breath
shall
spend
itself
in
doing
service
to
earth
by
striving
to
make
men
know
aright
what
earth
will
for
a
time
possess
and
then
forever
heaven
god
servant
man
friend
the
saviour
of
the
weak
the
foe
of
all
who
are
vile
and
to
the
gossips
of
arezzo
and
of
rome
the
fribble
and
coxcomb
and
priest
caponsacchi
if
any
point
in
the
whole
long
poem
ring
and
the
can
be
described
as
central
it
must
be
found
in
the
relations
each
to
the
other
of
caponsacchi
and
pompilia
the
truth
of
it
as
conceived
by
browning
could
hardly
be
told
otherwise
than
in
poetry
for
it
needs
the
faith
that
comes
through
spiritual
beauty
to
render
it
comprehensible
and
credible
and
such
beauty
is
best
expressed
by
art
it
is
easy
to
convince
the
world
of
a
passion
between
the
sexes
which
is
simply
animal
nor
is
art
much
needed
to
help
out
the
proof
happily
the
human
love
in
which
body
and
soul
play
in
varying
degrees
their
parts
and
each
an
honoured
part
is
in
widest
commonalty
spread
but
the
love
that
is
wholly
spiritual
seems
to
some
a
supernatural
thing
and
if
it
be
not
discredited
as
utterly
unreal
which
at
certain
periods
if
literature
be
a
test
has
been
the
case
it
is
apt
to
appear
as
a
thing
tenuous
and
cold
but
in
truth
this
reality
once
experienced
makes
the
other
realities
appear
the
shadows
and
it
is
an
ardour
as
passionate
as
any
that
is
known
to
man
its
special
note
is
a
deliverance
from
self
with
a
joy
in
abandonment
to
some
thing
other
than
self
like
that
which
has
been
often
recorded
as
an
experience
in
religious
conversion
when
bunyan
for
example
ceased
from
the
efforts
to
establish
his
own
righteousness
and
saw
that
righteousness
above
him
in
the
eternal
heavens
he
walked
as
a
man
suddenly
illuminated
and
could
hardly
forbear
telling
his
joy
to
the
crows
upon
the
and
so
in
its
degree
with
the
spiritual
exaltation
produced
by
the
love
of
man
and
woman
when
it
touches
a
certain
rare
but
real
altitude
if
a
poet
can
succeed
in
lifting
up
our
hearts
so
that
they
may
know
for
actual
the
truth
of
these
things
he
has
contributed
an
important
fragment
towards
an
interpretation
of
human
life
and
this
browning
has
assuredly
done
the
sense
of
a
power
outside
oneself
whose
influence
invades
the
man
the
conviction
that
the
secret
of
life
has
been
revealed
the
lying
passive
and
prone
to
the
influx
of
the
spirit
the
illumination
the
joy
the
assurance
that
old
things
have
passed
away
and
that
all
things
have
become
new
the
acceptance
of
a
supreme
law
the
belief
in
a
victory
obtained
over
time
and
death
the
rapture
in
a
heart
prepared
for
all
entire
immolation
these
are
rendered
by
browning
with
a
fidelity
which
if
reached
solely
by
imagination
is
indeed
surprising
for
who
can
discover
these
mysteries
except
through
a
personal
experience
if
the
senses
as
perhaps
they
do
in
such
mysteries
they
are
senses
in
a
state
of
transfiguration
senses
taken
up
into
the
spirit
whether
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body

can
not
tell
when
caponsacchi
bears
the
body
of
pompilia
in
a
swoon
to
her
chamber
in
the
inn
at
castelnuovo
it
is
as
if
he
bore
the
host
from
the
first
moment
when
he
set
eyes
upon
her
in
the
theatre
a
lady
young
tall
beautiful
strange
and
sad
he
is
delivered
from
his
frivolous
self
he
is
solemnized
and
awed
the
form
of
his
worship
is
his
first
word
to
her
i
am
yours
is
an
eternity
of
speech
to
match
the
immeasurable
depth
o
the
soul
that
then
broke
silence
to
abstain
from
ever
seeing
her
again
would
be
joy
more
than
pain
if
this
were
duty
to
her
and
to
god
for
him
the
mere
revelation
of
pompilia
would
suffice
his
inmost
feeling
is
summed
up
with
perfect
adequacy
in
a
word
to
the
judges
you
know
this
is
not
love
sirs
it
is
faith
there
is
another
kind
of
faith
which
comes
not
suddenly
through
passion
but
slowly
through
thought
and
action
and
trial
and
the
long
fidelity
of
a
life
it
is
that
of
which
milton
speaks
in
the
lines
till
old
experience
do
attain
to
something
of
prophetic
strain
this
is
the
faith
of
browning
pope
innocent
who
up
to
extreme
old
age
has
kept
open
his
intelligence
both
on
the
earthward
and
the
godward
sides
and
who
being
wholly
delivered
from
self
by
that
devotion
to
duty
which
is
the
habit
of
his
mind
can
apprehend
the
truth
of
things
and
pronounce
judgment
upon
them
almost
with
the
certitude
of
an
instrument
of
the
divine
righteousness
and
yet
he
is
entirely
human
god
vicegerent
and
also
an
old
man
learned
in
the
secrets
of
the
heart
patient
in
the
inquisition
of
facts
weighing
his
documents
scrutinising
each
fragment
of
evidence
burdened
by
the
sense
of
responsibility
cheered
also
by
the
opportunity
of
true
service
grave
but
not
sad
simple
sagacious
mild
yet
resolute
with
prudence
probity
and
what
beside
from
the
other
world
he
feels
impress
at
times
a
grey
ultimate
decrepitude
yet
visited
by
the
spiritual
fire
which
touches
a
soul
whose
robe
of
flesh
is
worn
thin
not
unassailed
by
doubts
as
to
the
justice
of
his
final
decision
but
assured
that
his
part
is
confidently
to
make
the
best
use
of
the
powers
with
which
he
has
been
entrusted
young
of
heart
if
also
old
in
his
rejoicing
in
goodness
and
his
antipathy
to
evil
ring
and
the
is
a
great
receptacle
into
which
browning
poured
with
an
affluence
that
perhaps
is
excessive
all
his
powers
his
searchings
for
truth
his
passion
his
casuistry
his
feeling
for
beauty
his
tenderness
his
gift
of
pity
his
veiled
memories
of
what
was
most
precious
in
the
past
his
hopes
for
the
future
his
worldly
knowledge
his
unworldly
aspirations
his
humour
such
as
it
was
robust
rather
than
delicate
could
the
three
monologues
which
tell
how
in
various
ways
it
strikes
a
roman
contemporary
have
been
fused
into
a
single
dialogue
could
the
speeches
of
the
two
advocates
have
been
briefly
set
over
one
against
the
other
instead
of
being
drawn
out
at
length
we
might
still
have
got
the
whole
of
browning
mind
but
we
must
take
things
as
we
find
them
and
perhaps
a
skilled
writer
knows
his
own
business
best
never
was
browning
mastery
in
narrative
displayed
with
such
effect
as
in
caponsacchi
account
of
the
flight
to
rome
which
is
not
mere
record
but
record
winged
with
lyrical
enthusiasm
never
was
his
tenderness
so
deep
or
poignant
as
in
his
realisation
of
the
motherhood
of
pompilia
never
were
the
gropings
of
intellect
and
the
intuitions
of
the
spirit
shown
by
him
in
their
weakness
and
their
strength
with
such
a
lucid
subtlety
as
in
the
deliberations
and
decisions
of
the
pope
the
whole
poem
which
he
compares
to
a
ring
was
the
ring
of
a
strong
male
finger
but
the
posy
of
the
ring
and
the
comparison
is
again
his
own
tells
how
it
was
a
gift
hammered
and
filed
during
the
years
of
smithcraft
in
memoriam
in
memory
and
also
with
a
hope
the
british
public
whom
browning
addresses
at
the
close
of
his
poem
and
who
liked
him
not
during
so
many
years
now
when
he
was
not
far
from
sixty
went
over
to
his
side
ring
and
the
almost
immediately
passed
into
a
second
edition
the
decade
from
onwards
is
called
by
mrs
orr
the
fullest
period
in
browning
life
his
social
occupations
and
entertainments
both
in
london
and
for
a
time
as
a
visitor
at
became
more
numerous
and
absorbing
yet
he
had
energy
for
work
as
well
as
for
play
during
these
ten
years
no
fewer
than
nine
new
volumes
of
his
poetry
appeared
none
of
them
are
london
poems
and
italy
is
for
the
present
almost
forgotten
it
is
the
scene
of
only
two
or
three
short
pieces
which
are
included
in
the
volume
of
and
how
he
worked
in
distemper
with
other
the
other
pieces
of
the
decade
as
regards
their
origin
fall
with
a
single
exception
into
two
groups
first
those
of
ancient
greece
suggested
by
browning
studies
in
classical
drama
secondly
those
which
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
are
connected
with
his
summer
wanderings
in
france
and
switzerland
the
of
prince
is
leicester
square
but
this
also
is
one
of
the
poems
of
france
inn
alone
is
english
in
its
characters
and
their
surroundings
such
a
grouping
of
the
works
of
the
period
is
of
a
superficial
nature
and
it
can
be
readily
dismissed
it
brings
into
prominence
however
the
fact
that
browning
while
resolved
to
work
out
what
was
in
him
lay
open
to
casual
suggestions
he
had
acquired
certain
methods
which
he
could
apply
to
almost
any
topic
he
had
confidence
that
any
subject
on
which
he
concentrated
his
powers
of
mind
could
be
compelled
to
yield
material
of
interest
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
exercised
always
a
wise
discretion
in
the
choice
of
subjects
these
ought
to
have
been
excellent
in
themselves
he
trusted
too
much
to
the
successful
issue
of
the
play
of
his
own
intellect
and
imagination
around
and
about
his
subjects
ring
and
the
had
given
him
practice
extending
over
several
years
in
handling
the
large
dramatic
monologue
now
he
was
prepared
to
stretch
the
dramatic
monologue
beyond
the
bounds
and
new
devices
were
invented
to
keep
it
from
stagnating
and
to
carry
it
forward
imaginary
disputants
intervene
in
the
monologue
there
are
objections
replies
retorts
a
second
player
in
the
game
not
being
found
the
speaker
has
to
play
against
himself
in
the
story
of
the
roman
fancy
was
mingled
with
fact
and
truth
with
falsehood
with
a
view
to
making
truth
in
the
end
the
more
salient
the
poet
had
used
to
the
full
his
dramatic
right
of
throwing
himself
into
intellectual
sympathy
with
persons
towards
whom
he
stood
in
moral
antagonism
or
at
least
experienced
an
inward
sense
of
alienation
the
characteristic
of
much
of
his
later
poetry
is
that
it
is
for
ever
tasking
falsehood
to
yield
up
truth
for
ever
to
employ
imagery
of
his
own
as
a
swimmer
beating
the
treacherous
water
with
the
feet
in
order
that
the
head
may
rise
higher
into
the
pure
air
made
for
the
breathing
browning
genius
united
an
intellect
which
delighted
in
the
investigation
of
complex
problems
with
a
spiritual
and
emotional
nature
manifesting
itself
in
swift
and
simple
solutions
of
those
problems
it
united
an
analytic
or
discursive
power
supplied
by
the
head
with
an
intuitive
power
springing
from
the
heart
he
employed
his
brain
to
twist
and
tangle
a
gordian
knot
in
order
that
in
a
moment
it
might
be
cut
with
the
sword
of
the
spirit
in
the
earlier
poems
his
spiritual
ardours
and
intuitions
were
often
present
throughout
and
without
latency
without
reserve
impassioned
truth
often
flashed
upon
the
reader
through
no
intervening
or
resisting
medium
in
ring
and
the
and
in
a
far
greater
degree
in
some
subsequent
poems
while
the
supreme
authority
resides
in
the
spiritual
intuitions
or
the
passions
of
the
heart
their
instantaneous
decisive
work
waits
until
a
prolonged
casuistry
has
accomplished
its
utmost
falsehood
seems
almost
more
needful
in
the
process
of
the
poet
than
truth
and
yet
it
is
never
actually
so
rather
to
the
poet
as
a
moral
explorer
it
appeared
a
kind
of
cowardice
to
seek
truth
only
where
it
may
easily
be
found
the
strenuous
hunter
will
track
it
through
all
winding
ways
of
error
it
is
thrown
out
as
a
spot
of
intense
illumination
upon
a
background
of
darkness
it
leaps
forth
as
the
flash
of
the
piercing
through
a
mist
the
masculine
characters
in
the
poems
are
commonly
made
the
exponents
of
intellectual
casuistry
a
an
aristophanes
and
they
are
made
to
say
the
best
and
the
most
truthful
words
that
can
be
uttered
by
such
as
they
are
and
from
such
positions
as
theirs
the
female
characters
a
balaustion
the
lady
of
sorrows
in
inn
and
others
are
often
revealers
of
sudden
truth
which
with
them
is
either
a
divine
revelation
the
vision
seen
from
a
higher
and
clearer
standpoint
or
a
dictate
of
pure
human
passion
eminent
moments
in
life
had
an
extraordinary
interest
for
browning
moments
when
life
caught
up
out
of
the
habitual
ways
and
the
lower
levels
of
prudence
takes
its
guidance
and
inspiring
motive
from
an
immediate
discovery
of
truth
through
some
noble
ardour
of
the
heart
therefore
it
did
not
seem
much
to
him
to
task
his
ingenuity
through
almost
all
the
pages
of
a
laborious
book
in
creating
a
tangle
and
embroilment
of
evil
and
good
of
truth
and
falsehood
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
shining
moment
is
at
last
to
spring
forward
and
do
its
work
of
severing
absolutely
and
finally
right
from
wrong
and
shame
from
a
splendour
of
righteousness
readers
longed
at
times
and
not
without
cause
for
the
old
directness
and
the
old
pervading
presence
of
spiritual
and
impassioned
truth

of
he

village
on

where
milsand
occupied
a
little
cottage
hard
by
at
night
the
of
havre
shot
forth
its
beam
and
it
was
with
a
thrill
that
browning
saw
far
off
the
spot
where
he
had
once
sojourned
with
his
wife
i
do
think
we
were
ever
quite
so
thoroughly
washed
by
the
from
all
quarters
as
here
he
wrote
in
august
every
morning
as
mme
blanc
th
bentzon
tells
us
he
might
be
seen
walking
along
the
sands
with
the
small
greek
copy
of
homer
which
was
his
constant
companion
on
sunday
he
went
with
the
milsands
to
a
service
held
in
the
chapel
of
the
chateau
blagny
at
for
the
few
protestants
of
that
region
they
were
generally
accompanied
by
a
young
huguenot
peasant

neighbour

the
courtesy
he
showed
to
every
woman
used
to
take
a
little
bag
from
the
hands
of
the
strong
norman
girl
notwithstanding
her
entreaties
the
visit
of
was
saddened
by
the
knowledge
of
what
france
was
suffering
during
the
progress
of
the
war
he
lingered
as
long
as
possible
for
the
sake
of
comradeship
with
milsand
around
whose
shoulder
browning
arm
would
often
lie
as
they
walked
together
on
the
beach
but
communication
with
england
became
daily
more
and
more
difficult
milsand
insisted
that
his
friend
should
instantly
return
it
is
said
by
mme
blanc
that
browning
was
actually
suspected
by
the
peasants
of
a
neighbouring
village
of
being
a
prussian
spy
not
without
difficulty
he
and
his
sister
reached
honfleur
where
an
english
was
found
preparing
to
start
at
midnight
for
southampton
two
years
later
miss
thackeray
was
also
on

slight
misunderstanding
on

part
the
fruit
of
gossipry

caused

cleared
away
by
the
good
offices
of
milsand

thackeray
sat
writing
with
shutters
closed
against

blazing
sun
browning
himself
dressed

to

evening
they

a

mr
browning
told

it
was
the
only

him
the
bedrooms
were
as
bare
as
the
but
i
remember
a
little
dumb
piano
standing
in
a
corner
on
which
he
used
to
practise
in
the
early
morning
i
heard
mr
browning
declare
they
were
perfectly
satisfied
with
their
little
house
that
his
brains
squeezed
as
dry
as
a
sponge
were
only
ready
for
fresh
air
perhaps
browning
only
book
of
contained
the
dramas
of
√¶schylus
for
at
fontainebleau
where
he
spent
some
later
weeks
of
the
year
these
were
the
special
subject

interest
in
those
who
were
rendered
homeless
and
destitute
in
france
during
the
prussian
invasion
was
shown
in
a
practical
way
in
the
spring
of
he
had
for
long
been
averse
to
the
publication
of
his
poems
in
magazines
and
reviews
in
he
had
gratified
his
american
admirers
by
allowing
and
to
appear
in
the
previous
to
their
inclusion
in
a
fine
sonnet
written
in

by

erected
at
clandeboye
by
lord
dufferin
in

of

been
inserted
in
some
undistributed
copies
of
a
pamphlet
helen

privately
printed
twenty
years
previously
the
sonnet
was
published
at
the
close
of
in
the
mall
but
was
not
given
a
place
by
browning
in
the
collected
editions
of
his
poetical
works
in
general
he
felt
that
the
miscellaneous
contents
of
a
magazine
surrounding
a
poem
formed
hardly
an
appropriate
setting
for
such
verse
as
his
in
february
however
he
offered
to
his
friend
and
publisher
mr
smith
the
ballad
of
for
use
in
the
of

the

of
the
french

were
examined
and
indicated
the
substantial
accuracy
of
the
poem
on
one
point
browning
erred
it
was
not
a
day
holiday
to
be
spent
with
his
wife
la
belle

which
the
breton
sailor
petitioned
for
as
the
reward
of
his

acknowledging
his
error
to
dr
furnivall
and

an
explanation
of
its
cause
he
dismissed

subject
with
the

above
all

the
matter
as
you
please
for
the
purposes

browning
ballad
of
the
croisickese
pilot
is
associated

says
mrs

becoming
exhausted
yet
some
rest
and
refreshment
after
the
heavy
tax
upon
his
strength
made
by
a
london
season
with
its
various
claims
were
essential

his
his
passion
for
music
would
not
permit
him
during
his
residence
in
town
to
be
absent
from
a
single
important
concert
the
extraordinary
range
of
his
acquaintance
with
the
works
of
great
and
even
of
obscure
composers
was
attested
by
halle

his
sonnet

in

had
become

loved
music
like

was
now
often
his
companion
at
public
performances
in
london
she
was

with
too
little

the

of

browning
knew
the
sensitiveness
of
her
nature
which
responded
to
the
touch
of
affection
and
he
could
not
fail
to
discover
her
true
self
veiled
though
it
was
by
a
superficial
reserve

was
the
companion
and
of
browning
and
his
sister
in
their
various
summer
wanderings
from
to
in
the
first
of
these
years
the
three
friends
occupied
a
house
facing
the
sea
at
the
village
of
mers
near
tr√©port
browning
at
this
time
was
much
absorbed
by
his
here
writes
mrs
orr
with
uninterrupted
quiet
and
in
a
room
devoted
to
his
use
mr
browning
would
work
till
the
afternoon
was
advanced
and
then
set
off
on
a
long
walk
over
the
cliffs
often
in
the
face
of
a
wind
which
as
he
wrote
of
it
at
the
time
he
could
lean
against
as
if
it
were
a
wall
the
following
summers
were
spent
at
villers
in
normandy
at
the
isle
of
arran
and
in
the
upland
country
of
the
sal√®ve
near
geneva
during
the
visit
to
the
sal√®ve
district
where
browning
and
his
sister
with
miss
occupied
a
chalet
named
la
saisiaz
he
was
mrs
orr
tells
us
unusually
depressed
and
unusually
disposed
to
regard
the
absence
from
home
as
a
banishment
yet
the
place
seemed
lovely
to
him
in
its
solitude
and
its
beauty
the
prospect
of
geneva
with
lake
and
plain
extended
below
varying
in
appearance
with
the
shifting
of
clouds
was
repose
to
his
sense
of
sight
he
bathed
twice
each
day
in
the
mountain
stream
a
marvel
of
delicate
delight
framed
in
with
trees
he
read
and
rested
and
wrote
but
little
or
not
at
all
suddenly
the
repose
of
la
saisiaz
was
broken
up
the
mood
of
languorous
pleasure
and
drowsy
discontent
was
at
an
end
while
preparing
to
join
her
friend
on
a
mountain
climb
miss
with
no
forewarning
died
the
shock
was
for
a
time
overwhelming
when
browning
returned
to
london
the
poem
the
record
of
his
inquisition
into
the
mystery
of
death
of
his
inward
debate
concerning
a
future
life
was
written
it
was
the
effort
of
resilience
in
his
spirit
in
opposition
to
that
stroke
which
deprived
him
of
the
friend
who
was
so
near
and
dear
the
grouping
of
the
works
produced
by
browning
from
the
date
of
the
publication
of
ring
and
the
to
the
publication
of
which
is
founded
upon
the
occasions
that
suggested
them
has
only
an
external
and
historical
interest
the
studies
in
the
greek
drama
and
the
creations
to
which
these
gave
rise
extend
at
intervals
over
the
whole
decade
was
published
in
in
the
translation
of
agamemnon
of
in
two
of
the
volumes
of
this
period
and
at
the
are
casuistical
monologues
and
these
it
will
be
observed
lie
side
by
side
in
the
chronological
order
the
first
of
the
pair
is
concerned
with
public
and
political
life
with
the
conduct
and
character
of
a
man
engaged
in
the
affairs
of
state
the
second
with
a
domestic
question
the
casuistry
of
wedded
fidelity
and
infidelity
from
which
the
scope
of
the
poem
extends
itself
to
a
wider
survey
of
human
existence
and
its
meanings
two
of
the
volumes
are
narrative
poems
each
tending
to
a
tragic
crisis
cotton
is
a
story
entangled
with
questions
relating
to
religion
inn
is
a
tragedy
of
the
passion
of
love
the
volume
of
with
other
is
the
miscellaneous
gathering
of
lyrical
and
narrative
pieces
which
had
come
into
being
during
a
period
of
many
years
finally
in
browning
writing
in
his
own
person
records
the
experience
of
his
spirit
in
confronting
the
problem
of
death
but
it
was
part
of
his
creed
that
the
gladness
of
life
may
take
hands
with
its
grief
that
the
poet
who
would
live
mightily
must
live
joyously
and
in
the
volume
which
contained
his
poem
of
strenuous
and
virile
sorrow
he
did
not
refrain
from
including
a
second
piece
two
poets
of
which
has
in
it
much
matter
of
honest
mirth
and
closes
with
the
declaration
that
the
test
of
greatness
in
an
artist
lies
in
his
power
of
converting
his
more
than
common
sufferings
into
a
more
than
common
joy
dedicated
to
the
countess
cowper
by
whom
the
transcript
from
euripides
was
suggested
or
as
browning
will
have
it
prescribed
proved
as
the
dedication
declares
the
most
delightful
of
amusements
in
the
spring
of
it
was
the
happiest
of
thoughts
to
give
the
version
of
euripides
play
that
setting
which
has
for
its
source
a
passage
at
the
close
of
plutarch
life
of
nicias
the
favours
bestowed
by
the
syracusans
upon
athenian
slaves
and
fugitives
who
could
delight
them
by
reciting
or
singing
the
verses
of
euripides
is
not
to
be
marvelled
at
says
plutarch
weying
a
reporte
made
of
a
ship
of
the
city
of
caunus
that
on
a
time
being
chased
thether
by
pyrates
thinking
to
save
themselves
within
their
portes
could
not
at
the
first
be
received
but
had
repulse
howbeit
being
demaunded
whether
they
could
sing
any
of
euripides
songes
and
aunswering
that
they
could
were
straight
suffered
to
enter
and
come
in
from
this
root
blossomed
browning
romance
of
the
rhodian
girl
who
saves
her
country
folk
and
wins
a
lover
and
a
husband
by
her
delight
in
the
poetry
of
one
who
was
more
highly
honoured
abroad
than
in
his
own
athens
perhaps
browning
felt
that
an
ardent
girl
would
be
the
best
interpreter
of
the
womanly
heroism
and
the
pathos
of
that
strangest
saddest
sweetest
song
of
euripides
of
all
its
author
dramas
the
alkestis
is
the
most
appropriate
to
the
occasion
for
it
is
the
poem
of
a
great
deliverance
from
death
and
here
in
effect
it
delivers
from
death
or
worse
the
fugitives
from
the
at
destruction
very
edge
who
are
the
suppliants
to
syracuse
in
accepting
the
task
imposed
upon
him
browning
must
have
felt
that
no
other
play
of
euripides
could
so
entirely
have
borne
out
the
justice
of
the
characterisation
of
the
poet
by
mrs
browning
in
the
lines
which
he
prefixed
to
our
euripides
the
human
with
his
droppings
of
warm
tears
if
the
alkestis
is
not
the
masterpiece
of
the
genius
of
euripides
wrote
paul
de
it
is
perhaps
the
masterpiece
of
his
heart
balaustion
herself
not
a
rose
of
the
rosy
isle
but
its
since
amid
the
verdure
of
the
tree

shall
find

at
once

hellenic
in
her
bright
and
swift
intelligence
her
enthusiasm
for
all
noble
things
of
the
mind
the
grace
of
every
movement
of
her
spirit
her
culture
and
her
beauty
the
atmosphere
of
the
poem
which
encircles
the
translation
is
singularly
luminous
and
animating
the
narrative
of
the
adventure
is
rapid
yet
always
lucid
the
verse
leaps
buoyantly
like
a
wave
of
the
sea
balaustion
tells
her
tale
to
the
four
greek
girls

companions

its
sanctities
of
religion
and
of
art
by
a
happy
and
original
device
the
transcript
of
the
alkestis
is
much
more
than
a
translation
it
is
a
translation
rendered
into
dramatic
action
for
we
see
and
hear
the
performers
and
they
are
no
longer
masked
and
this
is
accompanied
with
a
commentary
or
an
interpretation
never
was
a
more
graceful
apology
for
the
function
of
the
critic
put
forward
than
that
of
balaustion
is
the

if
i
too
should
try
and
speak
at
times

your
love

where
my
love
perchance

a
nest
before
you
knew
why

the
poor
climber
for
love
sake
browning
has
not
often
played
the
part
of
a
critic
and
the
interpretation
of
a
poet
work
by
a
poet
has
the
double
value
of
throwing
light
upon
the
mind
of
the
original
writer
and
the
mind
of
his
commentator
the
life
of
mortals
and
the
life
of
the
immortal
gods
are
brought
into
a
beautiful
relation
throughout
the
play
it
is
human
in
its
grief
and
in
its
joy
yet
at
every
point
the
divine
care
the
divine
help

and

in
the
service
of
admetos
herakles
most
human
of
demigods
is
the
king
friend
and
guest
the
interest
of
the
play
for
browning
lay
especially
in
three
things
the
pure
of
the
heroine
devotion
embodied
in
one
supreme
deed
and
no
one
can
heighten
the
effect
with
which
euripides
has
rendered
this
secondly
the
joyous
beneficent
strength
of
herakles
and
this
browning
has
felt
in
a
peculiar
degree
and
by
his
commentary
has
placed
it
in
higher
relief
and
thirdly
the
purification
and
elevation
through
suffering
of
the
character
of
admetos
here
it
would
be
rash
to
assert
that
browning
has
not
divined
the
intention
of
euripides
but
certainly
he
has
added
something
of
his
own
it
has
been
maintained
that
browning
interpretation
of
the
spiritual
significance
of
the
drama
is
a
beautiful
perversion
of
the
purpose
of
the
greek
poet
that
admetos
needs
no
purification
that
in
accepting
his
wife
offer
to
be
his
substitute
in
dying
the
king
was
no
craven
but
a
king
who
recognised
duty
to
the
state
as
his
highest
duty
the
general
feeling
of
readers
of
the
play
does
not
fall
in
with
this
ingenious
plea
browning
as
appears
from
his
imagined
recast
of
the
theme
which
follows
the
transcript
had
considered
and
rejected
it
if
admetos
is
to
be
in
some
degree
justified
it
can
only
be
by
bearing
in
mind
that
the
fact
by
which
he
shall
himself
escape
from
death
is
of
apollo
institution
and
that
obedience
to
the
purpose
of
apollo
rendered
a
kind
of
virtue
but
admetos
makes
no
such
defence
of
his
action
when
replying
to
the
reproaches
of
his
father
and
he
anticipates
that
the
verdict
of
the
world
will
be
against
him
browning
undoubtedly
presses
the
case
against
admetos
far
more
strongly
than
does
euripides
who
seems
to
hold
that
a
man
weak
in
one
respect
weak
when
brought
to
face
the
test
of
death
may
yet
be
strong
in
the
heroic
mastery
of
grief
which
is
imposed
upon
him
by
the
duties
of
hospitality
readers
of
the
winter
tale
have
sometimes
wondered
whether
there
could
be
much
rapture
of
joy
in
the
heart
of
the
silent
hermione
when
she
received
back
her
unworthy
husband
if
admetos
remained
at
the
close
of
the
play
what
he
is
understood
by
browning
to
have
been
at
its
opening
reunion
with
a
so
base
could
hardly
have
flushed
with
gladness
the
spirit
of
alkestis
just
escaped
from
the
shades
but
alkestis
who
had
proved
her
own
loyalty
by
deeds
values
deeds
more
than
words
when
dying
she
had
put
her
love
into
an
act
and
had
refrained
from
mere
words
of
wifely
tenderness
death
put
an
end
to
her
services
to
her
husband
she
felt
towards
him
as
any
wife
if
browning
earlier
poem
be
true
may
feel
to
any
husband
but
still
she
could
render
a
service
to
her
children
and
she
exacts
from
admetos
the
promise
that
he
will
never
place
a
stepmother
over
them
his
allegiance
to
this
vow
is
an
act
and
it
shall
be
for
alkestis
the
test
of
his
entire
loyalty
and
the
good
herakles
who
enjoys
a
glorious
jest
amazingly
and
who
by
that
jest
can
benevolently
retort
upon
admetos
for
his
concealment
of
death
for
now
the
position
is
reversed
and
the
king
shall
receive
her
living
and
yet
believe
her
dead
herakles
contrives
to
put
admetos
to
that
precise
test
which
is
alone
sufficient
to
assure
alkestis
of
his
fidelity
words
are
words
but
here
is
a
deed
and
admetos
not
only
adheres
to
his
pledge
but
demonstrates
to
her
that
for
him
to
violate
it
is
impossible
she
may
well
accept
him
as
at
length
proved
to
be
her
very
own
browning
who
delights
to
show
how
good
is
brought
out
of
evil
or
what
appears
such
to
mortal
eyes
is
not
content
with
this
he
must
trace
the
whole
process
of
the
purification
of
the
soul
of
admetos
by
sorrow
and
its
cruel
yet
beneficent
reality
and
in
his
commentary
he
emphasises
each
point
of
development
in
that
process
when
his
wife
lies
at
the
point
of
death
the
sorrow
of
admetos
is
not
insincere
but
there
was
a
childishness
in
it
for
he
would
not
confront
the
fact
that
the
event
was
of
his
own
election
presently
she
has
departed
and
he
begins
to
taste
the
truth
to
distinguish
between
a
sorrow
rehearsed
in
fancy
and
endured
in
fact
in
greeting
herakles
he
rises
to
a
manlier
strain
puts
tears
away
and
accepts
the
realities
of
life
and
death
he
will
not
add
ill
to
ill
as
the
sentimentalist
does
but
will
be
just
to
the
rights
of
earth
that
remain
he
catches
some
genuine
strength
from
the
magnanimous
presence
of
the
he
renders
duty
to
the
dead
is
quieted
and
enters
more
and
more
into
the
sternness
of
his
solitary
wayfaring
in
dealing
with
the
ignoble
wrangle
with
old
pheres
the
critic
is
hard
set
but
balaustion
speaking
as
interpreter
for
browning
explains
that
for
a
little
the
king
lapses
back
from
the
firmer
foothold
which
he
had
attained
perhaps
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
admit
that
euripides
has
marred
his
own
work
by
this
grim
encounter
of
crabbed
age
and
youth
but
it
is
true
that
one
who
has
much
to
give
like
alkestis
gives
freely
and
one
who
has
little
to
give
like
pheres
clutches
that
little
desperately
and
is
starved
not
only
in
possessions
but
in
soul
for
browning
the
significance
of
the
scene
lies
in
the
idea
which
if
not
just
is
ingenious
that
the
encounter
with
pheres
has
an
educational
value
for
admetos
he
detests
his
father
because
he
sees
in
him
an
image
of
his
own
egoism
and
thus
he
learns
more
profoundly
to
hate
his
baser
self
when
the
body
of
alkestis
has
been
borne
away
and
the
king
his
desolate
halls
the
full
truth
breaks
in
upon
him
nothing
can
be
as
it
has
been
before
he
stared
at
the
impossible
mad
life
he
has
learnt
that
life
which
yet
shall
be
rightly
lived
is
a
harder
thing
than
death
he
was
beginning
to
be
like
his
wife
and
those
around
him
felt
that
having
descended
in
grief
so
far
to
the
truth
of
things
he
could
not
but
return
to
the
light
an
altered
and
a
better
man
instructed
so
deeply
in
the
realities
of
sorrow
admetos
is
at
last
made
worthy
to
receive
the
blessed
realities
of
joy
with
the
words
when
i
betray
her
though
she
is
no
more
may
i
die
the
regeneration
of
admetos
is
accomplished
how
much
in
all
this
exposition
is
derived
from
the
play
how
much
is
added
to
it
may
be
left
for
the
consideration
of
the
reader
who
will
compare
the
original
with
the
transcript
if
the
character
of
admetos
is
somewhat
lowered
by
browning
beneath
the
conception
of
the
greek
dramatist
to
allow
room
for
its
subsequent
elevation
the
conception
of
herakles
is
certainly
heightened
we
shall
not
say
that
balaustion
is
the
speaker
and
that
herakles
is
somewhat
of
a
woman
hero
browning
himself
fully
enters
into
enthusiasm
and
the
presence
of
the
strong
joyous
helper
of
men
is
in
truth
an
inspiring
one
the
great
voice
that
goes
before
him
is
itself
a
corda
a
challenge
and
a
summons
to
whatever
manliness
is
in
us
and
the
best
of
it
is
that
sauntering
the
pavement
or
crossing
the
ferry
we
may
happen
to
encounter
this
face
of
herakles
out
of
this
face
emerge
banners
and
horses
o
superb
i
see
what
is
coming
i
see
the
high
i
see
the
slaves
of
runners
clearing
the
way
i
hear
victorious
drums
this
face
is
a
for
walt
whitman
too
had
seen
brother
jonathan
herakles
and
indeed
the
face
of
the
strong
and
tender
was
itself
as
the
face
of
a
calmer
herakles
to
many
about
to
die
the
speeches
of
the
demigod
in
browning
transcript
require
an
abundant
commentary
but
it
is
the
commentary
of
an
irrepressible
joy
an
outbreak
of
enthusiasm
which
will
not
be
controlled
the
glorious
gargantuan
creature
in
the
best
sense
rabelaisian
is
uplifted
by
browning
into
a
very
saint
of
joyous
effort
no
pallid
ascetic
indeed
beating
his
breast
with
the
stone
but
a
christian
saint
of
luther
school
while
at
the
same
time
a
somewhat
benevolent
paynim
giant
gladness
be
with
thee
helper
of
our
world
i
think
this
is
the
authentic
sign
and
sea
of
godship
that
it
ever
waxes
glad
and
more
glad
until
gladness
blossoms
bursts
into
a
rage
to
suffer
for
mankind
and
recommence
at
sorrow
something
of
the
herakles
ideal
appears
again
and
again
in
other
poems
of
browning
his
breton
sailor
herv√©
riel
has
more
than
a
touch
of
the
heraclean
frankness
of
gaiety
in
arduous
effort
his
iv√†n
iv√†novitch
wields
the
axe
and
abolishes
a
life
with
the
heraclean
joy
in
righteousness
and
in
the
last
of
browning
poems
not
without
a
pathetically
effort
and
strain
there
is
the
suggestion
of
an
ideal
conception
of
himself
as
a
the
old
man
tries
at
least
to
send
his
great
voice
before
him
the
new
admetos
new
alkestis
imagined
by
balaustion
at
the
close
of
the
poem
are
wedded
lovers
who
like
the
married
in
pompilia
dream
of
heaven
know
themselves
into
one
for
them
the
severance
of
death
has
become
an
impossible
thing
and
therefore
no
place
is
left
for
herakles
in
this
treatment
of
the
story
it
expresses
browning
highest
conception
of
the
union
of
soul
with
soul
therewith
her
whole
soul
entered
into
his
he
looked
the
look
back
and
alkestis
died
died
only
to
be
rejected
by
hades
as
still
living
and
with
a
more
potent
life
in
her
husband
heart
and
will
yet
the
mortal
cloud
is
round
these
mortals
still
they
can
not
see
things
as
the
gods
see
and
for
all
their
hopes
and
endeavours
the
earth
which
they
would
renew
and
make
as
heaven
remains
the
old
incredulous
unconverted
earth
such
is
the
envy
gods
still
bear
mankind
and
in
such
an
earth
if
not
for
them
assuredly
for
others
herakles
may
find
great
deeds
to
do
balaustion
has
the
unique
distinction
of
being
heroine
throughout
two
of
browning
poems
and
of
both
we
may
say
that
the
genius
of
euripides
is
the
hero
is
written
from
first
to
last
with
unflagging
energy
the
translation
of
the
herakles
which
it
includes
is
a
masculine
and
masterly
effort
to
transport
the
whole
sense
and
spirit
of
the
original
into
english
verse
and
the
rendering
of
the
choral
passages
into
lyric
form
gives
it
an
advantage
over
the
transcript
of
the
alkestis
perhaps
not
a
little
of
the
of
aristophanes
and
his
statement
of
the
case
against
euripides
could
have
been
put
as
well
or
better
in
a
critical
essay
in
prose
but
the
method
of
browning
enables
him
to
mingle
in
a
dramatic
fashion
truth
with
sophistry
and
to
make
both
serve
his
purpose
of
presenting
not
only
the
case
but
the
character
of
the
great
greek
maker
of
comedy
balaustion
is
no
longer
the
ardent
girl
of
the
days
of
her
first
adventure
she
is
a
wife
with
the
dignity
the
authority
of
womanhood
and
wifehood
she
has
known
the
life
of
athens
with
its
evil
and
its
good
she
has
been
the
favoured
friend
of
euripides
she
is
capable
of
confronting
his
powerful
rival
in
popular
favour
and
of
awing
him
into
sobriety
and
becoming
manners
with
an
instinctive
avoidance
she
recoils
from
whatever
is
gross
or
uncomely
yet
she
can
do
honour
to
the
true
light
of
intellect
and
genius
even
though
it
shines
through
vapours
and
amid
base
surroundings
athens
the
life
and
light
of
the
whole
world
has
sunk
under
the
power
of
sparta
and
it
can
be
henceforth
no
home
for
balaustion
and
her
euthukles
the
bark
that
bears
them
is
bounding
rhodesward
and
the
verse
has
in
it
the
leap
and
race
of
the
prow
balaustion
stricken
at
heart
yet
feels
that
this
tragedy
of
athens
brings
the
tragic
katharsis
the
justice
of
the
gods
is
visible
in
it
and
above
wickedness
and
folly
she
reaches
to
yon
blue
liberality
of
heaven
it
seems
as
if
the
spirit
which
might
have
saved
athens
is
that
of
the
loins
girt
and
the
lamp
lit
which
was
embodied
in
the
strenuous
devotion
of
euripides
to
the
highest
things
and
the
spirit
which
has
brought
athens
to
its
ruin
is
that
expressed
with
a
splendid
power
through
the
work
of
aristophanes
but
aristophanes
shall
plead
for
himself
and
leave
nothing
unsaid
that
can
serve
to
vindicate
him
as
a
poet
and
even
as
a
moralist
thus
only
can
truth
in
the
end
stand
clear
assured
of
its
supremacy
over
falsehood
and
over
nothing
that
browning
has
written
is
more
vividly
imagined
than
the
encounter
of
balaustion
with
aristophanes
and
his
crew
of
revellers
on
the
night
when
the
tidings
of
the
death
of
euripides
reached
athens
it
rouses
and
controls
the
feelings
with
the
tumult
of
life
and
the
sanctity
of
death
while
also
imposing
itself
on
the
eye
as
a
brilliant
and
a
solemn
picture
the
revellers
scatter
before
the
presence
of
balaustion
and
she
and
the
great
traducer
of
euripides
stand
face
to
face
nowhere
else
has
browning
presented
this
conception
of
the
man
of
vast
disorderly
genius
who
sees
and
approves
the
better
way
and
splendidly
follows
the
worse
such
domineering
deity
hephaistos
might
have
carved
to
cut
the
brine
for
his
gay
brother
prow
imbrue
that
path
which
purpling
recognised
the
conqueror
it
is
as
if
male
force
with
the
lust
of
the
eye
the
lust
of
the
flesh
and
the
pride
of
life
behind
it
were
met
and
held
in
check
by
the
finer
feminine
force
resting
for
its
support
upon
the
divine
laws
but
in
truth
aristophanes
is
half
on
the
side
of
balaustion
and
of
euripides
he
must
indeed
make
his
stand
he
is
not
one
to
falter
or
quail
and
yet
when
the
sudden
cloud
falls
upon
his
face
he
knows
that
it
is
his
part
to
make
the
worse
appear
the
better
cause
knowing
this
all
the
more
because
the
justice
of
balaustion
regard
perceives
and
recognises
his
higher
self
suddenly
the
tuphon
madding
the
brine
with
wrath
or
monstrous
sport
is
transformed
into
something
like
what
the
child
saw
once
from
the
rhodian
the
old
romantic
poet
in
browning
is
here
young
once
more
all
at
once
from
his
wave
out
leaned
chin
pensive
on
the
ledge
a
face
sad
as
mortality
divine
with
yearning
after
fellowship
he
rose
but
so
much
god
she
saw
so
much
she
sees
now
and
does
reverence
but
in
a
moment
the
is
again
the
with
frisk
of
fin
the
majestic
aristophanes
relapses
into
the
most
wonderful
of
mockers
no
passage
in
the
poem
is
quite
so
impressive
as
this
through
its
strangeness
in
beauty
but
the
entry
of
sophocles
an
old
majesty
at
the
supper
which
followed
the
performance
of
the
play
is
another
of
those
passages
to
find
which
is
a
sufficient
reward
for
reading
many
laborious
pages
that
might
almost
as
well
have
been
thrown
into
an
imaginary
conversation
in
prose
then
the
grey
brow
sank
low
and
sophokles
him
sweeping
doorward
mutely
passed
rows
as
mute
the
critical
study
of
comedy
its
origin
its
development
its
function
its
decline
is
written
with
admirable
vigour
but
the
case
of
aristophanes
can
be
read
elsewhere
it
is
interesting
however
to
note
the
argument
in
support
of
the
thesis
that
comedy
points
really
to
ideals
of
humanity
which
are
beyond
human
attainment
that
its
mockery
of
man
infirmities
implies
a
conception
of
our
nature
which
in
truth
is
while
tragedy
on
the
contrary
accepts
man
as
he
is
in
his
veritable
weakness
and
veritable
strength
and
wrings
its
pity
and
its
terror
out
of
these
it
is
aristophanes
who
thus
vindicates
euripides
before
the
revellers
who
have
assembled
in
his
own
honour
and
they
accept
what
seems
to
them
a
paradox
as
his
finest
stroke
of
irony
but
he
has
indeed
after
the
solemn
withdrawal
of
sophocles
looked
for
a
moment
through
life
and
death
and
seen
in
his
hour
of
highest
success
his
depth
of
failure
for
him
in
this
of
life
art
has
been
the
means
of
probation
he
has
squandered
the
gifts
bestowed
upon
him
which
should
have
been
concentrated
in
the
special
task
to
which
he
was
summoned
he
should
have
known
he
did
in
fact
know
that
the
art
which
makes
grave
is
higher
than
that
which
makes
grin
his
own
peculiar
duty
was
to
advance
his
art
one
step
beyond
his
predecessors
to
create
a
drama
which
should
bring
into
harmony
the
virtue
of
tragedy
and
the
virtue
of
comedy
to
discover
the
poetry
which
makes
wise
not
grave
and
glad
not
grinning
whereby
laughter
joins
with
tears
instead
of
making
this
advance
he
had
retrograded
and
it
remained
for
a
poet
of
a
future
in
the
kassiterides
the
tin
isle
which
has
stratford
at
its
heart
to
accomplish
the
task
on
which
aristophanes
would
not
adventure
one
way
a
brilliant
success
was
certain
for
aristophanes
the
other
and
better
way
failure
was
possible
and
he
declined
to
make
the
venture
of
faith
it
is
with
this
sense
of
upon
him
that
he
essays
his
own
defence
and
it
is
against
this
sense
of
more
than
against
the
genius
and
the
methods
of
euripides
that
he
struggles
when
towards
the
close
of
the
poem
he
takes
in
hand
the
psalterion
and
chants
in
splendid
strains
the
story
of
thamuris
who
aspired
and
failed
as
he
himself
will
never
do
the
reader
is
almost
won
over
to
his
side
browning
who
felt
the
heights
and
depths
of
the
lyric
genius
of
aristophanes
would
seem
to
have
resolved
that
in
this
song
of
thamuris
marching
moving
in
ecstasy
amid
the
glories
of
an
autumn
morning
he
would
dramatically
justify
his
conception
of
the
poet
and
never
in
his
youth
did
browning
sing
with
a
finer
rapture
of
spirit
but
reading
what
follows
the
record
of
the
subjugation
of
athens
when
the
athenian
people
accept
the
ruin
of
their
defences
as
if
it
were
but
a
fragment
of
aristophanic
comedy
we
perceive
that
this
song
which
breaks
off
with
an
uproar
of
laughter
is
the
condemnation
as
well
as
the
glory
of
the
singer
the
translation
of
the
preface
to
which
is
dated
october
was
undertaken
at
the
request
or
command
of
carlyle
the
argument
of
the
preface
fails
to
justify
browning
method
a
translation
literal
at
every
cost
save
that
of
absolute
violence
to
our
language
may
be
highly
desirable
it
is
commonly
called
a
crib
and
a
crib
contrived
by
one
who
is
not
only
a
scholar
but
a
man
of
genius
will
now
and
again
yield
a
word
or
a
phrase
of
felicitous
precision
but
that
a
translation
literal
at
every
cost
should
be
put
into
verse
is
a
wrong
both
to
the
original
and
to
the
poetry
of
the
language
to
which
the
original
is
transferred
it
assumes
a
poetic
garb
which
in
assuming
it
rends
to
tatters
a
translation
into
verse
implies
that
a
certain
beauty
of
form
is
part
of
the
writer
aim
it
implies
that
a
poem
is
to
be
reproduced
as
a
poem
and
not
as
that
bastard
product
of
learned
ill
judgment
a
glorified
crib
and
a
glorified
crib
is
necessarily
a
bad
crib
mrs
orr
who
tells
us
that
browning
refused
to
regard
even
the
first
of
greek
writers
as
models
of
literary
style
had
no
doubt
that
the
translation
of
the
was
partly
made
for
the
pleasure
of
exposing
the
false
claims
made
on
their
behalf
such
a
supposition
does
not
agree
well
with
browning
own
preface
but
if
he
had
desired
to
prove
that
the
can
be
so
rendered
as
to
be
barely
readable
he
has
been
singularly
successful
from
first
to
last
in
the
genius
of
browning
there
was
an
element
showing
itself
from
time
to
time
of
strange
perversity

problem
and
narrative
poems
which
appeared
in
december
four
months
after
the
publication
of
was
written
by
browning
during
a
visit
to
friends
in
scotland
his
interest
in
modern
politics
was
considerable
but
in
general
it
remained
remote
from
his
work
as
a
poet
he
professed
himself
a
liberal
but
he
was
a
liberal
who
because
he
was
such
claimed
the
right
of
independent
judgment
he
had
rejoiced
in
the
enfranchisement
of
italy
during
the
american
civil
war
he
was
strongly
on
the
side
of
the
north
as
letters
to
story
written
when
his
private
grief
lay
heavy
upon
him
abundantly
show
he
was
at
one
time
a
friend
of
the
movement
in
favour
of
granting
the
parliamentary
suffrage
to
women
but
late
in
life
his
opinion
on
this
question
altered
he
was
as
decidedly
opposed
to
the
proposals
for
a
separate
or
subordinate
parliament
for
ireland
as
were
his
friends
carlyle
and
tennyson
and
matthew
arnold
after
the
introduction
of
the
home
rule
bill
he
could
not
bring
himself
though
requested
by
a
friend
to
write
words
which
would
have
expressed
or
implied
esteem
for
the
statesman
who
had
made
that
most
inopportune
experiment
in
opportunism
and
whose
talents
he
admired
yet
for
a
certain
kind
of
opportunism
that
which
conserves
rather
than
destroys
browning
thought
that
much
might
fairly
be
said
to
say
this
with
a
special
reference
to
the
fallen
emperor
of
france
he
wrote
his
browning
instinctive
sympathies
are
not
with
the
saviour
of
society
who
maintains
for
temporary
reasons
a
tottering
edifice
he
naturally
applauds
the
man
who
builds
on
sure
foundations
or
the
man
who
in
order
to
reach
those
foundations
boldly
removes
the
accumulated
lumber
of
the
past
but
there
are
times
when
perhaps
the
choice
lies
only
between
conservation
of
what
is
imperfect
and
the
attempt
to
erect
an
airy
fabric
which
has
no
basis
upon
the
solid
earth
and
browning
on
the
whole
preferred
a
veritable
however
remote
from
the
ideal
to
a
sham
or
a
real
cloudcuckootown
it
is
true
that
what
is
settled
by
custom
though
it
be
not
good
yet
at
least
it
is
fit
and
those
things
which
have
long
gone
together
are
as
it
were
confederate
within
themselves
whereas
new
things
piece
not
so
well
but
though
they
help
by
their
utility
yet
they
trouble
by
their
inconformity
these
words
of
one
whose
worldly
wisdom
was
more
profoundly
studied
than
ever
browning
was
might
stand
as
a
motto
for
the
poem
but
the
pregnant
sentence
of
bacon
which
follows
these
words
should
be
added
all
this
is
true
if
time
stood
still
pleading
is
not
a
merely
ingenious
defence
of
the
untenable
either
with
reference
to
the
general
thesis
or
its
application
to
the
french
empire
he
did
not
like
his
wife
think
of
the
emperor
as
if
he
were
a
paladin
of
modern
romance
but
he
honestly
believed
that
he
had
for
a
time
done
genuine
service
though
not
the
highest
to
france
and
to
the
world
my
opinion
of
the
solid
good
rendered
years
ago
he
wrote
in
september
to
story
is
unchanged
the
subsequent
deference
to
the
clerical
party
in
france
and
support
of
brigandage
is
poor
work
but
it
surely
is
doing
little
harm
to
the
general
good
and
to
miss
blagden
after
the
publication
of
his
poem
i
thought
badly
of
him
at
the
beginning
of
his
career
pour
better
afterward
on
the
strength
of
the
promises
he
made
and
gave
indications
of
intending
to
redeem
i
think
him
very
weak
in
the
last
miserable
year
it
seemed
to
browning
a
case
in
which
a
veritable
was
admissible
in
the
interests
of
truth
and
justice
and
by
placing
this
in
the
mouth
of
the
emperor
himself
certain
sophistries
were
also
legitimate
that
might
help
to
give
the
whole
the
dramatic
character
which
the
purposes
of
poetry
as
the
exposition
of
a
complex
human
character
required
the
misfortune
was
that
in
making
choice
of
such
a
subject
browning
condemned
himself
to
write
with
his
left
hand
to
fight
with
one
arm
pinioned
to
exhibit
the
case
on
behalf
of
the
saviour
of
society
with
his
brain
rather
than
with
brain
and
heart
acting
together
he
was
to
demonstrate
that
in
the
scale
of
spiritual
colours
there
is
a
respectable
place
for
drab
this
may
be
undertaken
with
skill
and
vigour
but
hardly
with
enthusiastic
pleasure
is
an
interesting
intellectual
exercise
and
if
this
constitutes
a
poem
a
poem
it
is
but
the
theme
is
fitter
for
a
prose
discussion
browning
intellectual
ability
became
a
snare
by
which
the
poet
within
him
was
entrapped
the
music
that
he
makes
here
is
the
music
of
master
hugues
of
so
your
fugue
broadens
and
thickens
greatens
and
deepens
and
lengthens
till
one
exclaims
but
where
music
the
dickens
the
mysterious
sphinx
who
expounds
his
riddle
and
dissertates
on
himself
in
an
imaginary
leicester
square
says
many
things
that
deserve
to
be
considered
but
they
are
addressed
to
our
understanding
in
the
first
instance
and
only
in
a
secondary
and
indirect
way
reach
our
feelings
and
our
imagination
the
interest
of
the
poem
is
virtually
exhausted
in
a
single
reading
to
a
true
work
of
art
we
return
again
and
again
for
renewed
delight
we
return
to
as
to
a
valuable
of
arguments
or
practical
considerations
in
defence
of
a
conservative
opportunism
but
if
we
have
once
appropriated
these
we
do
not
need
the
book
there
is
a
spirit
of
conservation
like
that
of
edmund
burke
which
has
in
it
a
wise
enthusiasm
we
might
almost
say
a
wise
mysticism
browning
prince
is
not
a
conservator
possessed
by
this
enthusiasm
something
almost
pathetic
may
be
felt
in
his
sense
that
the
work
allotted
to
him
is
work
of
mere
temporary
and
transitory
utility
he
has
no
high
inspirations
such
as
support
the
men
who
change
the
face
of
the
world
the
divine
ruler
who
has
given
him
his
special
faculties
who
has
enjoined
upon
him
his
special
tasks
holds
no
further
communication
with
him
but
he
will
do
the
work
of
a
mere
man
in
a
strength
such
as
it
is
he
can
not
make
new
things
he
can
use
the
thing
he
finds
he
can
for
a
term
of
years
do
the
best
with
the
least
change
possible
he
can
turn
to
good
account
what
is
already
and
so
he
believes
he
can
in
a
sense
with
god
so
long
as
he
was
an
irresponsible
dreamer
a
mere
voice
in
the
air
it
was
permitted
him
to
indulge
in
glorious
dreams
to
utter
shining
words
now
that
his
feet
are
on
the
earth
now
that
his
thoughts
convert
themselves
into
deeds
he
must
accept
the
limitations
of
earth
the
idealists
may
put
forth
this
programme
and
that
his
business
is
not
with
them
but
with
the
present
needs
of
the
humble
mass
of
his
people
men
that
have
wives
and
women
that
have
babes
whose
first
demand
is
bread
by
intelligence
and
sympathy
he
will
effect
equal
sustainment
everywhere
throughout
society
and
when
the
man
of
genius
who
is
to
alter
the
world
arises
such
a
man
most
of
all
will
approve
the
work
of
his
predecessor
who
left
him
no
mere
shine
and
shade
on
which
to
operate
but
the
good
hard
substance
of
common
human
life
all
this
is
admirably
put
and
it
is
interesting
to
find
that
browning
who
had
rejoiced
with
herakles
doing
great
deeds
and
purging
the
world
of
monsters
could
also
honour
a
poor
provisional
atlas
whose
task
of
sustaining
a
poor
imperfect
globe
upon
his
shoulders
is
less
brilliant
but
not
perhaps
less
useful
nor
would
it
be
just
to
overlook
the
fact
that
in
three
or
four
pages
the
poet
asserts
himself
as
more
than
the
prudent
casuist
the
splendid
image
of
society
as
a
temple
from
which
winds
the
long
procession
of
powers
and
beauties
has
in
it
something
of
the
fine
mysticism
of
edmund
burke
the
record
of
the
early
and
irresponsible
aspirations
for
a
free
italy
ay
still
my
fragments
wander
sighs
of
the
soul
mine
once
mine
now
and
mine
for
ever
with
what
immediately
follows
would
have
satisfied
the
ardent
spirit
of
mrs
browning
and
the
characterisation
of
the
genius
of
the
french
nation
whose
lust
for
war
and
the
glory
of
war
browning
censures
as
the
of
the
race
rises
brilliantly
out
of
its
somewhat
gray
surroundings
the
people
here
earth
presses
to
her
heart
nor
owns
a
pride
above
her
pride
i
the
race
all
flame
and
air
and
aspiration
to
the
boundless
great
the
incommensurably
beautiful
whose
very
faulterings
groundward
come
of
flight
urged
by
a
pinion
all
too
passionate
for
heaven
and
what
it
holds
of
gloom
and
glow
bravest
of
thinkers
bravest
of
the
brave
doers
exalt
in
science
rapturous
in
art
the
more
than
all
magnetic
race
to
fascinate
their
fellows
mould
mankind
it
is
a
passage
conceived
in
the
same
spirit
as
the
great
chaunt
o
star
of
france
written
at
the
same
date
and
with
a
recognition
of
both
the
virtues
and
the
shames
of
france
by
the
american
poet
of
democracy
to
these
memorable
fragments
from
one
other
may
be
added
that
towards
the
close
of
the
poem
which
applies
the
tradition
of
the
succession
by
murder
of
the
priesthood
at
the
shrine
of
the
clitumnian
god
to
the
succession
of
men
of
genius
in
the
priesthood
of
the
world
the
new
power
slays
the
old
but
handsomely
in
there
is
nothing
enigmatical
it
is
just
what
i
imagine
the
man
might
if
he
pleased
say
for
himself
so
browning
wrote
to
miss
blagden
soon
after
the
publication
of
the
volume
many
persons
however
have
supposed
that
in
at
the
a
riddle
rather
than
a
poem
was
given
to
the
world
by
the
perversity
of
the
writer
when
she
comes
to
speak
of
this
work
browning
biographer
mrs
orr
is
it
is
for
her
a
piece
of
perplexing
cynicism
the
origin
of
the
poem
was
twofold
the
external
suggestion
came
from
the
fact
that
during
one
of
his
visits
to
pornic
browning
had
seen
the
original
of
his
fifine
and
she
lived
in
his
memory
as
a
subject
of
intellectual
curiosity
and
imaginative
interest
the
internal
suggestion
as
mrs
orr
hints
lay
in
a
certain
mood
of
resentment
against
himself
arising
from
the
fact
that
the
encroachments
of
the
world
seemed
to
estrange
in
some
degree
a
part
of
his
complex
being
from
entire
fidelity
to
his
own
past
the
world
in
fact
seemed
to
be
playing
with
browning
the
part
of
a
fifine
if
this
were
so
it
would
be
characteristic
of
browning
that
he
should
face
round
upon
the
world
and
come
to
an
explanation
with
his
adversary
but
this
could
not
in
a
printed
volume
be
done
in
his
own
person
he
was
not
one
to
take
the
public
into
his
confidence
the
discussion
should
be
removed
as
far
as
possible
from
his
own
circumstances
and
even
his
own
feelings
it
should
be
a
dramatic
debate
on
the
subject
of
fidelity
and
infidelity
on
the
bearings
of
the
apparent
to
the
true
on
the
relation
of
reality
in
this
our
mortal
life
to
illusion
as
he
studied
the
subject
it
assumed
new
significances
and
opened
up
wider
issues
an
actual
elvire
and
an
actual
fifine
may
be
the
starting
points
but
elvire
shall
stand
for
all
that
is
permanent
and
substantial
in
thought
and
feeling
fifine
for
all
that
is
transitory
and
illusive
the
question
of
conjugal
fidelity
is
as
much
the
subject
of
at
the
as
the
virtue
of
is
the
subject
of
berkeley
the
poem
is
in
fact
browning
a
chain
of
thoughts
and
feelings
reaching
with
no
break
in
the
chain
from
a
humble
basis
to
the
heights
of
speculation
but
before
all
else
at
the
is
a
poem
of
all
the
longer
poems
which
followed
ring
and
the
it
is
the
most
sustained
and
the
most
diversified
in
imaginative
power
to
point
out
passages
of
peculiar
beauty
passages
vivid
in
feeling
original
in
thought
would
here
be
out
of
place
for
the
brilliance
and
vigour
are
unflagging
and
what
we
have
to
complain
of
is
the
lack
of
some
passages
of
repose
the
joy
in
freedom
freedom
accepting
some
hidden
law
of
these
poor
losels
and
truants
from
convention
who
stroll
it
and
stage
it

gypsy

which
is
the
carnival
of
human
life
darkness
fallen
upon
the
plains
and
through
the
darkness
the
druidic
stones
gleaming
all
these
are
essentially
parts
of
the
texture
of
the
poem
yet
each
has
a
lustre
or
a
shimmer
or
grave
splendour
of
its
own
it
is
strange
that
any
reader
should
have
supposed
either
the
prologue
or
the
epilogue
to
be
uttered
by
the
imaginary
speaker
of
the
poem
both
shadow
forth
the
personal
feelings
of
browning
the
prologue
tells
of
the
gladness
he
still
found
both
in
the
world
of
imagination
and
the
world
of
reality
over
which
hovers
the
spirit
that
had
once
been
so
near
his
own
the
spirit
that
is
near
him
still
yet
moving
on
a
different
plane
perhaps
wondering
at
or
pitying
this
life
of
his
which
yet
he
accepts
with
cheer
and
will
turn
to
the
best
account
the
epilogue
veils
behind
its
grim
humour
the
desolate
feeling
that
came
upon
him
again
and
again
as
a
householder
in
this
house
of
life
for
behind
the
happiness
which
he
strenuously
maintained
there
lay
a
great
desolation
but
the
last
word
of
the
epilogue
love
is
all
and
death
is
nought
is
a
word
of
sustainment
wrung
out
of
sorrow
these
poems
have
surely
in
them
no
perplexing
cynicism
nor
has
the
poem
enclosed
between
them
when
it
is
seen
aright
browning
idea
in
the
poem
he
declared
in
reply
to
a
question
of
dr
furnivall
was
to
show
merely
how
a
don
juan
might
justify
himself
partly
by
truth
somewhat
by
sophistry
no
more
unhappy
misnomer
than
this
don
juan
could
have
been
devised
for
the
curious
ingenious
learned
experimenter
in
life
no
man
of
pleasure
in
the
vulgar
sense
of
the
word
but
a
deliberate
explorer
of
thoughts
and
things
who
argues
out
his
case
with
so
much
fine
casuistry
and
often
with
the
justest
conceptions
of
human
character
and
conduct
if
we
could
discover
a
dividing
line
between
his
truth
and
his
sophistry
we
might
discover
also
that
the
poem
is
no
exceptional
work
of
browning
for
which
an
apology
is
required
but
of
a
piece
with
his
other
writings
and
in
harmony
with
the
body
of
thought
and
feeling
expressed
through
them
now
it
is
certain
that
as
browning
advanced
in
years
he
more
and
more
distrusted
the
results
of
the
intellect
in
its
speculative
research
he
relied
more
and
more
upon
the
knowledge
that
comes
through
or
is
embodied
in
love
love
by
its
very
nature
implies
a
relation
what
is
felt
is
real
for
us
but
the
intellect
which
aspires
to
know
things
as
they
are
forever
lands
us
in
illusions
illusions
needful
for
our
education
and
therefore
far
from
unprofitable
to
be
forever
replaced
by
fresh
illusions
and
the
only
truth
we
thus
attain
is
the
conviction
that
truth
there
assuredly
is
that
we
must
forever
reach
after
it
and
must
forever
grasp
its
shadow
theologies
philosophies
scientific
theories
these
change
like
the
shifting
and
shredding
clouds
before
our
eyes
and
are
forever
succeeded
by
clouds
of
another
shape
and
hue
but
the
knowledge
involved
in
love
is
veritable
and
is
verified
at
least
for
us
who
love
while
in
his
practice
he
grew
more
scientific
in
research
for
truth
and
less
artistic
in
his
desire
for
beauty
such
was
the
doctrine
which
browning
upheld
the
speaker
in
at
the
is
far
more
a
seeker
for
knowledge
than
he
is
a
lover
and
he
has
learnt
and
learnt
aright
that
by
illusions
the
intellect
is
thrown
forward
towards
what
may
relatively
be
termed
the
truth
through
shadows
it
advances
upon
reality
when
he
argues
that
philosophies
and
theologies
are
the
fizgigs
of
the
brain
its
fifines
the
false
which
lead
us
onward
to
elvire
the
true
he
expresses
an
idea
which
browning
has
repeatedly
expressed
in
and
which
certainly
was
an
idea
he
had
made
his
own
and
if
a
man
approaches
the
other
sex
primarily
with
a
view
to
knowledge
with
a
view
to
confirm
and
to
extend
his
own
and
to
acquire
experience
of
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
womanhood
it
is
true
that
he
will
be
instructed
more
widely
if
not
more
deeply
by
elvire
supplemented
by
fifine
than
by
elvire
alone
the
sophistry
of
the
speaker
in
browning
poem
consists
chiefly
in
a
juggle
between
knowledge
and
love
and
in
asserting
as
true
of
love
what
browning
held
to
be
in
the
profoundest
sense
true
of
knowledge
the
poet
desires
as
butler
in
his
analogy
desired
to
take
lower
ground
than
his
own
but
the
curious
student
of
man
and
woman
of
love
and
knowledge
imagination
aiding
his
intellect
is
compelled
amid
his
sophistical
jugglings
to
work
out
his
problems
upon
browning
own
lines
and
he
becomes
a
witness
to
browning
own
conclusions
saul
before
the
poem
closes
is
also
among
the
prophets
for
him
as
for
browning
god
and
the
soul
stand
sure
he
sees
as
browning
sees
man
reaching
upward
through
illusions
religious
theories
philosophical
systems
scientific
hypotheses
artistic
methods
scholarly
attainments
to
the
divine
the
pornic
fair
has
become
the
venice
carnival
and
this
has
grown
to
the
vision
of
man
life
in
which
the
wanton
and
coquette
named
a
philosophy
or
a
theology
has
replaced
the
gipsy
in
tricot
the
speaker
misapplies
to
love
and
the
truths
obtained
by
love
browning
doctrine
concerning
knowledge
and
yet
even
so
he
is
forced
to
confess
however
inconsistent
his
action
may
be
with
his
belief
that
the
permanent
which
is
the
divine
can
be
reached
through
a
single
central
point
of
human
love
but
not
through
any
vain
attempt
to
manufacture
an
infinite
by
piecing
together
a
multitude
of
detached
points
his
problem
posed
aright
was
from
a
given
point
evolve
the
infinite
not
spend
thyself
in
space
endeavouring
to
joint
together
and
so
make
infinite
point
and
point
fix
into
one
elvire
a
of
fifines
if
he
continues
his
experiments
they
are
experiments
of
the
senses
or
of
the
intellect
which
he
knows
can
bring
no
profit
to
the
heart
out
of
thine
own
mouth
will
i
judge
thee
thou
wicked
servant
he
will
undoubtedly
let
this
be
frankly
acknowledged
grow
in
a
certain
kind
of
knowledge
and
as
certainly
he
will
dwindle
in
the
higher
knowledge
that
comes
through
love
the
poem
is
neither
enigmatical
nor
cynical
but
in
entire
accord
with
browning
own
deepest
convictions
and
highest
feelings
although
in
his
later
writings
browning
rendered
ever
more
and
more
homage
to
the
illuminating
power
of
the
affections
his
methods
unfortunately
became
as
has
been
said
more
and
more
scientific
or
shall
we
say
art
jealously
selects
its
subjects
those
which
possess
in
a
high
degree
spiritual
or
material
beauty
or
that
more
complete
beauty
which
unites
the
two
science
accepts
any
subject
which
promises
to
yield
its
appropriate
truth
browning
probing
after
psychological
truth
became
too
indifferent
to
the
truth
of
beauty
or
shall
we
say
that
his
vision
of
beauty
became
enlarged
so
that
in
laying
bare
by
dissection
the
anatomy
of
any
poor
corpse
he
found
an
artistic
joy
in
studying
the
enlacements
of
veins
and
nerves
to
say
this
is
perhaps
to
cheat
oneself
with
words
his
own
defence
would
doubtless
have
been
a
development
of
two
lines
which
occur
near
the
close
of
cotton
love
bids
touch
truth
endure
truth
and
embrace
truth
though
embracing
truth
love
crush
itself
and
he
would
have
pleaded
that
art
which
he
styles
the
love
of
loving
rage
of
knowing
seeing
feeling
the
absolute
truth
of
things
for
truth
sake
whole
and
sole
may
crush
itself
for
sake
of
the
truth
which
is
its
end
and
aim
but
the
greatest
masters
have
not
sought
for
beauty
merely
or
mainly
in
the
dissection
of
ugliness
nor
did
they
find
their
rejoicing
in
artistic
suicide
for
the
sake
of
psychological
discovery
to
browning
such
a
repulsive
story
as
that
of
cotton
served
now
as
well
as
one
which
in
earlier
days
would
have
attracted
him
by
its
grandeur
or
its
grace
here
was
a
fine
morbid
growth
an
exemplary
moral
wen
the
enormous
product
of
two
kinds
of
corruption
sensuality
and
superstition
and
what
could
be
a
more
fortunate
field
for
exploration
with
aid
of
the
scalpel
the
incidents
of
the
poem
were
historical
and
were
recent
antoine
mellerio
the
sometime
jeweller
of
paris
had
flung
himself
from
his
belvedere
in
the
suit
which
raised
the
question
of
his
sanity
at
the
date
when
his
will
had
been
signed
was
closed
in
the
scene
of
his
death
was
close
to
browning
place
of
summer
sojourn
the
subject
lay
close
to
browning
hand
it
was
an
excellent
subject
for
a
short
story
of
the
kind
that
gets
the
name
of
realistic
it
was
an
unfortunate
subject
for
a
long
poem
but
the
botanist
who
desires
to
study
vegetable
physiology
does
not
require
a
lily
or
a
rose
browning
who
viewed
things
from
the
ethical
as
well
as
the
psychological
standpoint
was
attracted
to
the
story
partly
because
it
was
he
thought
a
story
with
a
moral
he
did
not
merely
wish
to
examine
as
a
spiritual
chemist
the
action
of
castilian
blood
upon
a
french
brain
to
watch
and
make
a
report
upon
the
behaviour
of
inherited
faith
when
brought
into
contact
with
acquired
scepticism
the
scepticism
induced
by
the
sensual
temperament
of
the
boulevards
he
did
not
merely
wish
to
exhibit
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
a
life
divided
against
itself
his
purpose
was
also
to
rebuke
that
romantic
sentimentalism
which
would
preserve
the
picturesque
lumber
of
ruined
faiths
and
discredited
opinions
that
have
done
their
work
and
remain
only
as
sources
of
danger
to
persons
who
are
weak
of
brain
and
dim
of
sight
granted
the
conditions
it
was
browning
maintains
an
act
of
entire
sanity
on
the
part
of
his
sorry
hero
monsieur
l√©once
miranda
to
fling
himself
into
mid
air
to
put
his
faith
to
the
final
test
and
trust
to
our
blessed
lady
the
bespangled
and
bejewelled
ravissante
to
bear
him
in
safety
through
the
air
but
the
conditions
were
deplorable
and
those
who
declined
to
assist
in
carting
away
the
rubbish
of
medievalism
are
responsible
for
l√©once
miranda
bloody
the
moral
is
just
and
the
story
bears
it
well
yet
browning
own
conviction
that
man
highest
and
clearest
faith
is
no
more
than
a
shadow
of
the
unattainable
truth
may
for
a
moment
give
us
pause
an
iconoclast
even
such
an
iconoclast
as
voltaire
is
ordinarily
a
man
of
unqualified
faith
in
the
conclusions
of
the
intellect
if
our
best
conceptions
of
things
divine
be
but
a
kind
of
parable
why
quarrel
with
the
parables
accepted
by
other
minds
than
our
own
the
answer
is
twofold
first
browning
was
not
a
sceptic
with
respect
to
the
truths
attained
through
love
and
he
held
that
mankind
had
already
attained
through
love
truths
that
condemned
the
religion
of
and
terrified
propitiations
which
led
l√©once
miranda
to
reduce
his
right
hand
and
his
left
to
carbonised
stumps
and
dragged
him
kneeling
along
the
country
roads
to
manifest
his
devotion
to
the
image
of
the
virgin
secondly
he
held
that
our
education
through
intellectual
illusions
is
a
progressive
education
and
that
to
seek
to
live
in
an
obsolete
illusion
is
treason
against
humanity
therefore
his
exhortation
is
justified
by
his
logic
quick
conclude
removal
time
effects
so
tardily
of
what
is
plain
obstruction
rubbish
cleared
let
stand
while
ruin
may
and
serve
world
use
since
use
is
manifold
the
tower
which
once
served
as
a
belfry
may
possibly
be
still
of
use
to
some
father
secchi
to
tick
venus
off
in
transit
only
never
bring
bell
again
to
the
to
damage
him
aloft
brain
us
below
when
new
vibrations
bury
both
in
brick
for
which
sane
word
if
not
for
all
the
pages
of
his
poem
we
may
feel
gratefully
towards
the
writer
it
is
the
word
of
browning
the
moralist
the
study
of
the
hero
belongs
to
browning
the
psychologist
the
admirable
portrait
of
clara
the
successful
adventuress
harlot
and
favoured
daughter
of
the
church
is
the
chief
gift
received
through
this
poem
from
browning
the
artist
she
is
a
very
admirable
specimen
of
her
kind
the
species
of
caterpillar
and
having
with
beautiful
aplomb
outmanoeuvred
and
flouted
the
rapacious
cousinry
clara
is
seen
at
the
last
under
the
protection
of
holy
church
still
quietly
devouring
her
miranda
leaf
such
is
the
irony
of
nature
and
the
merit
of
a
perfect
digestive
apparatus
the
second
narrative
poem
of
this
period
inn
is
in
truth
a
short
series
of
dramatic
scenes
placed
in
a
narrative
it
is
as
concentrated
as
cotton
is
diffuse
and
the
unities
of
time
and
place
assist
the
tragic
concentration
a
recast
of
inn
might
indeed
have
appeared
as
a
drama
on
the
elizabethan
stage
side
by
side
with
such
a
brief
masterpiece
piteous
and
terrible
as
a
yorkshire
tragedy
it
moves
with
a
like
appalling
rapidity
towards
the
climax
and
the
catastrophe
the
incident
of
the
attempted
barter
of
a
discarded
mistress
to
clear
off
the
score
of
a
gambling
debt
is
derived
from
the
scandalous
chronicle
of
english
nineteenth
century
society
browning
tale
of
crime
was
styled
on
its
appearance
by
a
distinguished
critic
of
elizabethan
drama
the
story
of
a
penny
dreadful
he
was
right
but
he
should
have
added
that
some
of
the
most
impressive
and
elevated
pieces
of
our
dramatic
literature
have
had
sources
of
no
greater
dignity
the
story
of
the
penny
dreadful
is
here
rehandled
and
becomes
a
tragedy
of
which
the
material
part
is
only
a
translation
into
external
deed
of
a
tragedy
of
the
soul
the
as
refashioned
from
the
crude
fact
and
the
central
passions
of
the
poem
were
such
as
would
naturally
call
forth
what
was
characteristic
in
browning
genius
a
martyr
of
love
a
traitor
to
love
an
avenger
of
love
these
are
the
central
figures
the
girlish
innocence
of
the
cousin
is
needed
only
as
a
ray
of
morning
sunlight
to
relieve
the
eye
that
is
strained
and
pained
by
the
darkness
and
the
pallor
of
the
faces
of
the
exponents
of
passion
and
a
like
effect
is
produced
by
the
glimpses
of
landscape
rich
in
the
english
qualities
of
cultured
gladness
and
repose
which
browning
so
seldom
presented
but
which
are
perfectly
rendered
here
the
wooded
watered
country
hill
and
dale
and
thread
of
stream
with
mist
with
may
morning
diamond
drift
o
the
dew
we
must
feel
that
life
goes
on
with
leisurely
happiness
outside
the
little
room
that
isolates
its
tragic
occupants
the
smoke
from
fires
of
turf
and
wood
is
in
the
air
cottagers
are
at
their
morning
cookery
after
all
the
poet
of
the
inn
album
was
well
inspired
in
his
eloquent
address
hail
calm
acclivity
salubrious
spot
and
only
certain
incidents
which
time
will
soon
efface
have
touched
the
salutation
with
irony
in
this
poem
browning
reverts
to
his
earlier
method
of
clearly
and
simply
dividing
the
evil
from
the
good
we
are
not
embarrassed
by
the
mingling
of
truth
with
sophistry
our
instinctive
sympathies
are
not
held
in
check
but
are
on
the
contrary
reinforced
by
the
undisguised
sympathies
of
the
writer
we
are
no
more
in
doubt
where
wrong
and
where
justice
lie
than
if
count
gismond
were
confronting
count
gauthier
the
avenger
indeed
is
no
champion
of
romance
he
is
only
a
young
english
snob
a
little
slow
of
brain
a
little
unrefined
in
manner
a
clumsy
giant
handsome
creature
who
for
a
year
has
tried
to
acquire
under
an
accomplished
tutor
the
lore
of
cynical
worldliness
and
has
not
succeeded
for
he
is
manly
and
honest
and
has
the
gentleness
of
strength
for
ability
all
in
the
rough
yet
of
his
education
the
best
part
is
that
he
has
once
loved
and
been
thwarted
in
his
love
and
now
in
a
regard
for
his
cousin
his
need
is
that
of
occupation
for
his
big
idle
boy
heart
he
wants
something
to
do
someone
also
to
serve
browning
wishes
to
show
the
passion
of
righteousness
which
suddenly
flames
forth
and
abolishes
an
evil
thing
as
springing
from
no
peculiar
knightly
virtue
but
from
mere
honest
human
nature
the
huge
boy
somewhat
crude
somewhat
awkward
with
a
moral
temper
still
unclarified
has
enough
of
our
good
common
humanity
in
him
to
hold
no
parley
with
utter
wickedness
when
once
he
fully
apprehends
its
nature
therefore
he
springs
upon
it
in
one
swift
transport
of
rage
and
there
and
then
makes
an
end
of
it
his
big
red
hands
are
as
much
the
instruments
of
divine
justice
as
is
the
axe
of
iv√†n
iv√†novitch
the
traitor
of
the
poem
is
refinement
every
inch
from
brow
to
and
in
this
respect
it
can
not
be
said
that
villain
departs
widely
from
the
conventional
melodramatic
villain
of
the
stage
he
has
perhaps
like
the
stage
villain
a
little
too
much
of
that
cheap
knowingness
which
is
the
theatrical
badge
of
the
complete
man
of
the
world
but
which
gentlemen
in
actual
life
do
not
ordinarily
affect
there
is
here
and
elsewhere
in
browning
later
poetry
somewhat
too
free
an
indulgence
in
this
cheap
knowingness
as
if
with
a
nod
and
a
wink
he
would
inform
us
that
he
has
a
man
of
the
world
acquaintance
with
the
shady
side
of
life
and
this
is
not
quite
good
art
nor
is
it
quite
good
manners
the
vulgarity
of
the
man
in
the
street
may
have
a
redeeming
touch
of
animal
spirits
if
not
of
in
it
the
vulgarity
of
the
man
in
the
club
refinement
every
inch
is
beyond
redemption
the
exhibition
of
browning
traitor
as
having
slipped
lower
and
lower
down
the
slopes
of
baseness
because
he
has
been
false
to
his
one
experience
of
veritable
love
may
remind
us
also
of
the
melodramatic
stage
villain
but
the
tragic
and
pathetic
motives
of
melodrama
its
demonstrative
heroisms
its
stage
generosities
its
striking
attitudes
are
really
fictions
founded
upon
fact
and
the
facts
which
give
some
credit
to
the
stage
fictions
remain
for
the
true
creator
of
tragedy
to
discover
and
interpret
aright
the
melodramatic
is
often
the
truth
falsely
or
feebly
handled
the
same
truth
handled
aright
may
become
tragic
there
is
much
in
shakespeare
plays
which
if
treated
by
an
inferior
artist
would
at
once
sink
from
tragedy
to
melodrama
browning
escapes
from
melodrama
but
not
to
such
a
safe
position
that
we
can
quite
forget
its
neighbourhood
when
the
traitor
of
this
poem
is
withdrawn
as
was
guido
into
that
sad
obscure
sequestered
state
where
god
unmakes
but
to
remake
the
soul
he
else
made
first
in
vain
there
will
be
found
in
him
that
he
knew
the
worth
of
love
that
he
saw
the
horror
of
the
void
in
which
he
lived
and
that
for
a
moment
though
too
late
a
sudden
wave
of
not
ignoble
passion
overwhelmed
his
baser
self
even
if
only
to
let
the
fangs
of
the
treacherous
rock
reappear
in
their
starkness
and
cruelty
the
lady
again
with
her
superb
beauty
her
low
wide
brow
oppressed
by
sweeps
of
hair
darker
and
darker
as
they
coil
and
swathe
the
crowned
whence
the
eyes
burn
black
her
passion
her
despair
her
recovery
through
chilling
to
ice
the
heart
within
her
her
reawakening
to
life
and
the
pain
of
that
return
to
sensation
her
measureless
scorn
of
her
betrayer
her
exposure
of
his
last
fraud
and
her
death
the
lady
is
dangerously
near
the
melodramatic
heroine
and
yet
she
is
not
a
melodramatic
but
a
tragic
figure
far
more
than
pompilia
who
knew
the
joy
of
motherhood
is
she
the
martyr
of
love
and
yet
before
she
quits
life
in
her
protective
care
of
that
somewhat
formidable
somewhat
ungainly
baby
the
huge
boy
her
champion
hero
and
snob
she
finds
a
comforting
maternal
instinct
at
work
did
you
love
me
once
then
take
love
last
and
best
return
i
think
womanliness
means
only
motherhood
all
love
begins
and
ends
there
roams
enough
but
having
run
the
circle
rests
at
home
her
husband
good
man
will
not
suffer
acutely
for
her
loss
he
will
be
true
to
duty
and
continue
to
dose
his
flock
with
the
comfortable
dogma
of
in
which
not
one
of
them
believes
the
volume
of
was
the
first
collection
of
miscellaneous
poetry
put
forth
by
browning
since
the
appearance
twelve
years
previously
of
there
is
of
course
throughout
the
whole
the
presence
of
a
vigorous
personality
we
can
in
an
occasional
mood
tumble
and
toss
even
in
the
rough
verse
of
as
we
do
on
a
choppy
sea
on
which
the
sun
is
and
which
invigorates
while
it
not
always
agreeably
bobs
our
head
and
dashes
down
our
throat
but
vigour
alone
does
not
produce
poetry
and
it
may
easily
run
into
a
kind
of
effrontery
the
speciality
of
the
volume
as
compared
with
its
predecessors
is
that
it
contains
not
a
little
running
comment
by
browning
upon
himself
and
his
own
work
together
with
a
reply
to
his
unfriendly
critics
there
is
a
little
too
much
in
all
this
of
the
robustious
herakles
sending
his
great
voice
before
him
an
author
ought
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
no
pledge
to
admire
him
and
his
writings
has
been
administered
to
every
one
who
enters
the
world
and
that
as
sure
as
he
attracts
so
surely
must
he
repel
in
the
the
poet
informs
his
readers
that
those
who
expect
from
him
or
from
any
poet
strong
wine
of
verse
which
is
also
sweet
demand
the
impossible
sweet
the
strong
wine
can
become
only
after
it
has
long
lain
mellowing
in
the
cask
the
experience
of
readers
contradicted
the
assertion
some
who
drank
the
good
wines
of
and
of
in
the
year
of
the
vintages
found
that
they
were
strong
and
needed
no
keeping
to
be
sweet
must
make
distinctions
and
the
quality
of
the
yield
of
does
not
entitle
it
to
be
remembered
as
an
extraordinary
year
the
poem
from
which
the
volume
was
named
tells
in
verse
timed
by
raps
of
the
knuckle
how
the
painter
pacchiarotto
must
needs
become
a
or
at
least
a
in
his
distressed
siena
with
no
good
results
for
his
city
and
with
disastrous
results
for
himself
he
learns
by
unsavoury
experience
his
lesson
to
hold
on
by
the
and
and
do
his
own
work
accepting
the
mingled
evil
and
good
of
life
in
a
spirit
of
strenuous
not
indolent
playing
as
energetically
as
a
human
being
can
his
own
part
and
leaving
others
to
play
theirs
assured
that
for
all
and
each
this
life
is
the
and
test
of
eternity
the
rehearsal
for
the
performance
in
a
future
world
and
things
rarely
go
smooth
at
rehearsal
browning
joy
in
difficult
rhyming
as
seen
in
this
jingle
was
great
some
readers
may
be
permitted
to
wish
that
many
of
his
rhymes
were
not
merely
difficult
but
impossible
at
a
dinner
given
by
sir
leslie
stephen
he
met
successfully
the
challenge
to
produce
a
rhyme
for
rhinoceros
and
for
diversion
he
delivered
himself
of
an
impromptu
in
which
rhymes
were
found
for
ecclefechan
and
craigenputtock
but
in
rhyming
ingenuity
browning
is
inferior
to
the
author
of
hudibras
in
a
rhymer
elegant
effrontery
he
is
inferior
to
the
author
of
don
juan
effrontery
in
his
rhymes
expects
too
much
from
his
reader
who
may
be
amiable
enough
to
accept
rough
and
ready
successes
but
can
not
often
be
delighted
by
brilliant
gymnastics
of
sound
and
sense
in
like
manner
it
asks
for
a
particularly
reader
to
appreciate
the
wit
of
browning
retort
upon
his
critics
you
are
he
sings
out
in
his
great
voice
listen
i
have
invented
several
insulting
nicknames
for
you
decamp
or
my
housemaid
will
fling
the
slops
in
your
faces
this
may
appear
to
some
persons
to
be
genial
and
clever
it
certainly
has
none
of
the
exquisite
malignity
of
pope
poisoned
rapier
perhaps
it
is
a
little
dull
perhaps
it
is
a
little
outrageous
the
browning
who
masks
as
shakespeare
in
the
disclaims
the
ambition
of
heading
a
poetical
faction
condemns
the
byronic
and
announces
his
resolvedly
cheerful
acceptance
of
life
elsewhere
he
assures
his
readers
that
though
his
work
is
theirs
his
life
is
his
own
he
will
not
unlock
his
heart
in
sonnets
such
is
the
drift
of
the
verses
entitled
a
peep
through
the
window
is
permitted
but
please
you
no
foot
over
threshold
of
mine
this
was
not
shakespeare
wiser
way
if
he
hid
himself
behind
his
work
it
was
with
the
openness
and
with
the
taciturnity
of
nature
he
did
not
stand
in
the
window
of
his
house
declaring
that
he
was
not
to
be
seen
he
did
not
pull
up
and
draw
down
the
blind
to
make
it
appear
that
he
was
at
home
and
not
at
home
in
the
poem
browning
continues
his
assurances
that
he
is
no
eglamor
to
whom
verse
is
a
vague
and
vast
is
his
trade
as
and
is
the
goldsmith
but
do
you
suppose
that
the
poet
lives
no
life
of
his
own
how
and
where
it
is
not
for
you
to
guess
only
be
certain
it
is
far
away
from
his
counter
and
his
till
these
poems
were
needless
confidences
to
the
public
that
no
confidences
would
be
vouchsafed
to
them
but
the
volume
of
contains
better
work
than
these
pieces
of
the
two
and
have
each
of
them
a
surprise
of
beauty
the
one
tells
of
the
of
love
the
other
of
its
inward
glow
and
stability
is
characteristic
of
the
writer
the
woman
who
chooses
duty
rather
than
love
may
have
done
well
but
she
has
chosen
the
easier
way
and
perhaps
has
evaded
the
probation
of
life
the
man
who
chooses
passion
rather
than
duty
has
slipped
and
stumbled
but
his
was
the
harder
course
and
perhaps
the
better
which
of
the
two
was
sinner
which
was
saint
to
be
impeccable
may
be
the
most
damning
of
offences
in
martin
the
eerie
presence
of
ghosts
of
dead
loves
haunting
a
love
that
has
grown
upon
the
graves
of
the
past
is
a
check
upon
passion
which
by
a
sudden
turn
at
the
close
triumphs
in
a
victory
that
is
defeat
and
is
a
confession
of
the
trials
of
theistic
faith
in
a
world
from
which
god
seems
to
be
an
absentee
what
had
been
supposed
to
be
letters
from
our
friend
are
proved
forgeries
what
we
called
his
loving
actions
are
the
accumulated
results
of
the
natural
law
of
heredity
yet
even
if
theism
had
to
be
abandoned
it
would
have
borne
fruit
all
my
days
i
go
the
softlier
sadlier
for
that
dream
sake
how
forget
the
thrill
through
and
through
me
as
i
thought
the
gladlier
lives
my
friend
because
i
love
him
still
and
the
friend
will
value
love
all
the
more
which
persists
through
the
obstacles
of
partial
ignorance
the
blank
verse
monologue
browning
spanish
tragedy
is
a
romance
of
passion
subtle
in
its
psychology
tragic
in
its
action
out
of
its
darkness
gleams
especially
one
resplendent
passage
the
description
of
those
weapons
of
eastern
workmanship
horror
coquetting
with
voluptuousness
one
of
which
is
the
instrument
chosen
by
the
husband
hatred
now
replacing
his
contempt
to
confer
on
his
wife
a
death
that
is
voluptuous
the
incident
from
the
history
of
the
jews
in
italy
related
in
recalls
the
comedy
and
the
pathos
of
cross
to
which
it
is
in
every
respect
inferior
the
jew
of
the
centuries
of
christian
persecution
is
for
browning
imagination
a
being
and
and
wholly
human
a
note
in
verse
connected
with
shelley
would
be
excellent
as
a
note
in
prose
appended
to
the
tragedy
explaining
as
it
does
why
the
pope
inclining
to
pardon
beatrice
was
turned
aside
from
his
purposes
of
mercy
it
rather
loses
than
gains
in
value
by
having
been
thrown
into
verse
to
recover
our
loyalty
to
browning
as
a
poet
which
this
volume
sometimes
puts
to
the
test
we
might
well
reserve
for
the
close
the
pure
and
disempassioned
in
womanly
form
is
brought
face
to
face
with
the
passionate
and
sullied
lover
to
whom
her
charm
is
a
tyranny
she
is
no
warm
sun
but
a
white
moon
rising
above
this
lost
endymion
who
never
slumbers
but
goes
forth
on
hopeless
quests
at
the
bidding
of
his
mistress
and
wins
for
all
his
reward
the
sad
slow
silver
smile
which
is
now
pity
now
disdain
and
never
love
the
subjugating
power
of
chaste
and
beautiful
superiority
to
passion
over
this
mere
mortal
devotee
is
absolute
and
inexorable
is
the
nymph
an
abstraction
and
incarnation
of
something
that
may
be
found
in
womanhood
is
she
an
embodiment
of
the
ideal
which
sends
out
many
questers
and
pities
and
disdains
them
when
they
return
soiled
and
defeated
soft
and
sweet
as
she
appears
she

solitude
and
society
the
volume
which
consists
of
and
two
poets
of
brings
the
work
of
this
decade
to
a
close
the
record
of
thoughts
that
were
awakened
during
that
solitary
clamber
to
the
summit
of
sal√®ve
after
the
death
of
miss
is
not
an
elegy
but
it
remains
with
us
as
a
memorial
of
friendship
in
reading
it
we
discern
the
tall
white
figure
of
the
stranger
lady
leaning
through
the
terrace
wreaths
of
leaf
and
bloom
or
pacing
that
low
which
she
had
loved
and
called
her
own
it
serves
browning
purpose
in
the
poem
that
she
should
have
been
one
of
those
persons
who
in
this
world
have
not
manifested
all
that
lies
within
them
does
she
still
exist
or
is
she
now
no
more
than
the
thing
which
lies
in
the
little
enclosure
at
collonge
the
poem
after
its
solemn
and
impressive
prelude
becomes
the
record
of
an
hour
debate
of
the
writer
with
himself
a
debate
which
has
a
definite
aim
and
is
brought
to
a
definite
issue
in
conducting
that
debate
on
immortality
browning
is
neither
christian
nor
the
christian
creed
involves
a
question
of
history
he
can
not
here
admit
historical
considerations
he
will
see
the
matter
out
as
he
is
an
individual
soul
on
the
grounds
suggested
by
his
individual
consciousness
and
his
personal
knowledge
it
may
be
that
any
result
he
arrives
at
is
a
result
for
himself
alone
but
why
conduct
an
argument
in
verse
is
not
prose
a
fitter
medium
for
such
a
discussion
the
answer
is
that
the
poem
is
more
than
an
argument
it
is
the
record
in
verse
of
an
experience
the
story
of
a
pregnant
and
passionate
hour
during
which
passion
quickened
the
intellect
and
the
head
while
resisting
all
illusions
of
the
heart
was
roused
to
that
resistance
by
the
heart
itself
such
an
hour
is
full
of
events
it
may
be
almost
epic
in
its
plenitude
of
action
but
the
events
are
ideas
the
frame
and
setting
of
the
discussion
also
are
more
than
frame
and
setting
they
with
the
thoughts
they
form
part
of
the
experience
the
poet
is
alone
among
the
mountains
with
dawn
and
sunset
for
associates
jura
thrilled
to
gold
at
sunrise
sal√®ve
in
its
evening
which
strikes
greatness
small
or
at
night
he
is
beneath
the
luminous
worlds
which
one
by
one
came
lamping
chiefly
that
prepotency
of
mars
while
he
climbs
towards
the
summit
he
is
aware
of
earth
most
exquisite
disclosures
heaven
own
god
in
evidence
he
stands
face
to
face
with
nature
rather
with
infinitude
all
through
his
mountain
ascent
the
vigour
of
life
is
aroused
within
him
and
as
he
returns
there
is
her
grave
the
idea
of
a
future
life
for
which
this
earthly
life
serves
as
an
education
and
a
test
is
so
central
with
browning
so
largely
influences
all
his
feelings
and
penetrates
all
his
art
that
it
is
worth
while
to
attend
to
the
course
of
his
argument
and
the
nature
of
his
conclusion
he
puts
the
naked
question
to
himself
what
does
death
mean
is
it
total
extinction
is
it
a
passage
into
life
without
any
vagueness
without
any
flattering
metaphor
he
is
prepared
to
accept
or
endure
any
answer
if
only
it
be
the
truth
whether
his
discussion
leads
to
a
trustworthy
result
or
not
the
sincerity
and
the
energy
of
his
endeavour
after
truth
serve
to
banish
all
supine
and
moods
the
debate
of
which
his
poem
is
a
report
falls
into
two
parts
first
a
statement
of
facts
secondly
a
series
of
conjectures
conjectures
and
no
more
rising
from
the
basis
of
facts
that
are
ascertained
to
put
the
question
shall
i
survive
death
is
to
assume
that
i
exist
and
that
something
other
than
myself
exists
which
causes
me
now
to
live
and
presently
to
die
the
nature
of
this
power
outside
myself
i
do
not
know
we
may
for
convenience
call
it
god
beyond
these
two
facts
myself
and
a
power
environing
me
nothing
is
known
with
certainty
which
has
any
bearing
on
the
matter
in
dispute
i
am
like
a
floating
rush
borne
onward
by
a
stream
whither
borne
the
rush
can
not
tell
but
rush
and
stream
are
facts
that
can
not
be
questioned
knowing
that
i
exist
browning
goes
on
i
know
what
for
me
is
pain
and
what
is
pleasure
and
however
it
may
be
with
others
for
my
own
part
i
can
pronounce
upon
the
relation
of
joy
to
sorrow
in
this
my
life
on
earth
i
must
say
or
choke
in
silence
howsoever
came
my
fate
sorrow
did
and
joy
did
nowise
life
well
weighed
preponderate
if
this
failure
be
ordained
by
necessity
i
shall
bear
it
as
best
i
can
but
if
this
life
be
all
nothing
shall
force
me
to
say
that
life
has
proceeded
from
a
cause
supreme
in
goodness
wisdom
and
power
what
i
find
here
is
goodness
always
intermixed
with
evil
wisdom
which
means
an
advance
from
error
to
the
confession
of
ignorance
power
that
is
insufficient
to
adapt
a
human
being
to
his
surroundings
even
in
the
degree
in
which
a
worm
is
fitted
to
the
leaf
on
which
it
feeds
browning
tacitly
rejects
the
idea
that
the
world
is
the
work
of
some
blind
force
and
undoubtedly
our
reason
which
endeavours
to
reduce
all
things
in
nature
to
rational
conceptions
demands
that
we
should
conceive
the
world
as
rational
rather
than
as
some
wild
work
of
chance
upon
one
hypothesis
and
upon
one
alone
can
the
life
of
man
upon
this
globe
appear
the
result
of
intelligence
i
have
lived
then
done
and
suffered
loved
and
hated
learnt
and
taught
this
there
is
no
reconciling
wisdom
with
a
world
distraught
goodness
with
triumphant
evil
power
with
failure
in
the
aim
if
to
my
own
sense
remember
though
none
other
feel
the
same
if
you
bar
me
from
assuming
earth
to
be
a
pupil
place
and
life
time
with
all
their
chances
changes
just
probation
space
mine
for
me
grant
this
hypothesis
and
all
changes
from
irrational
to
rational
from
evil
to
good
from
pain
to
a
strenuous
joy
only
grant
a
second
life
i
acquiesce
in
this
present
life
as
failure
count
misfortune
worst
assaults
triumph
not
defeat
assured
that
loss
so
much
the
more
exalts
gain
about
to
be
thus
out
of
defeat
springs
victory
never
are
we
so
near
to
knowledge
as
when
we
are
checked
at
the
bounds
of
ignorance
beauty
is
felt
through
its
opposite
good
is
known
through
evil
truth
shows
its
potency
when
it
is
confronted
by
falsehood
while
for
love
oh
how
but
losing
love
does
whoso
loves
succeed
by
the
to
the
learning
what
is
love
indeed
yet
at
best
this
idea
of
a
future
life
remains
a
conjecture
an
hypothesis
a
hope
which
gives
a
key
to
the
mysteries
of
our
troubled
earthly
state
browning
proceeds
to
argue
that
such
a
hope
is
all
that
we
can
expect
or
ought
to
desire
the
absolute
assurance
of
a
future
life
and
of
rewards
and
punishments
consequent
on
our
deeds
in
the
present
world
would
defeat
the
very
end
for
which
according
to
the
hypothesis
we
are
placed
here
it
would
be
fatal
to
the
purpose
of
our
present
life
considered
as
a
state
of
probation
what
such
a
state
of
probation
requires
is
precisely
what
we
have
hope
no
less
than
this
and
no
more
does
our
heaven
overcloud
because
we
lack
certainty
no
hope
the
arrowy
just
as
constant
comes
to
pierce
its
gloom
compelled
by
a
power
and
by
a
purpose
which
if
no
one
else
beheld
i
behold
in
life
so
hope
such
is
the
conclusion
with
browning
of
the
whole
matter
it
is
in
entire
accordance
with
a
letter
which
he
wrote
two
years
previously
to
a
lady
who
supposed
herself
to
be
dying
and
who
had
thanked
him
for
help
derived
from
his
poems
all
the
help
i
can
offer
in
my
poor
degree
is
the
assurance
that
i
see
ever
reason
to
hold
by
the
same
hope
and
that
by
no
means
in
ignorance
of
what
has
been
advanced
to
the
contrary
god
bless
you
sustain
you
and
receive
you
to
dr
moncure
conway
who
had
lost
a
son
browning
wrote
if
i
who
can
not
would
restore
your
son
he
who
can
will
and
mr
rudolph
lehmann
records
his
words
in
conversation
i
have
doubted
and
denied
it
a
future
life
and
i
fear
have
even
printed
my
doubts
but
now
i
am
as
deeply
convinced
that
there
is
something
after
death
if
you
ask
me
what
i
no
more
know
it
than
my
dog
knows
who
and
what
i
am
he
knows
that
i
am
there
and
that
is
enough
for
him
browning
confession
in
that
the
sorrow
of
his
life
outweighed
its
joy
is
not
inconsistent
with
his
habitual
cheerfulness
of
manner
such
estimates
as
this
are
little
to
be
trusted
one
great
shock
of
pain
may
stand
for
ever
aloof
from
all
other
experiences
the
pleasant
sensations
of
many
days
pass
from
our
memory
we
can
not
tell
but
that
browning
supposed
himself
able
to
tell
is
in
itself
worthy
of
note
in
two
poets
of
which
was
written
in
london
immediately
after
and
which
though
of
little
intrinsic
importance
shows
that
browning
was
capable
of
a
certain
grace
in
verse
that
is
light
he
pleads
that
the
power
of
victoriously
dealing
with
pain
and
transforming
it
into
strength
may
be
taken
as
the
test
of
a
poet
greatness
yoke
hatred
crime
remorse
despair
but
ever
the
whirling
fear
let
through
the
tumult
break
the
poet
face
radiant
assured
his
wild
slaves
win
the
race
this
is
good
counsel
for
art
but
not
wholly
wise
counsel
for
life
sorrow
indeed
is
not
wronged
by
a
cheerfulness
cultivated
and
strenuously
maintained
but
gladness
does
suffer
a
certain
wrong
sunshine
comes
and
goes
the
attempt
to
substitute
any
unrelieved
light
for
sunshine
is
somewhat
of
a
failure
at
the
best
shadows
and
brightness
pursuing
each
other
according
to
the
course
of
nature
make
more
for
genuine
happiness
than
does
any
stream
of
moral
electricity
worked
from
a
dynamo
of
the
will
it
is
pleasanter
to
encounter
a
breeze
that
sinks
and
swells
that
lingers
and
hastens
than
to
face
a
vigorous
and
sustained
gale
even
of
a
tonic
quality
browning
unfailing
cheer
and
cordiality
of
manner
were
admirable
they
were
in
part
spontaneous
in
part
an
acceptance
of
duty
in
part
a
mode
of
they
were
only
less
excellent
than
the
varying
moods
of
a
simple
and
beautiful
nature
when
appeared
browning
was
years
old
he
lived
for
more
than
eleven
years
longer
during
which
period
he
published
six
volumes
of
verse
showing
new
powers
as
a
writer
of
brief
poetic
narrative
and
as
a
teacher
through
parables
but
he
produced
no
single
work
of
prolonged
and
sustained
effort
which
perhaps
was
well
his
physical
vigour
continued
for
long
unabated
he
still
enjoyed
the
various
pleasures
and
excitements
of
the
london
season
but
it
is
noted
by
mrs
orr
that
after
the
death
of
miss
he
almost
mechanically
renounced
all
the
musical
entertainments
to
which
she
had
so
regularly
accompanied
him
his
daily
habits
were
of
the
utmost
regularity
varying
hardly
at
all
from
week
to
week
he
was
averse
says
mrs
orr
to
every
hought
of
change
and
chose
rather
to
adapt
himself
to
external
conditions
than
to
enter
on
the
effort
of
altering
them
what
he
had
done
once
he
was
wont
for
that
very
reason
to
continue
doing
a
few
days
after
browning
death
a
journalist
obtained
from
a
photographer
mr
grove
who
had
formerly
been
for
seven
years
in
browning
service
the
particulars
as
to
how
an
ordinary
day
during
the
london
season
went
by
at
warwick
crescent
browning
rose
without
fail
at
seven
enjoyed
a
plate
of
whatever
fruit
strawberries
grapes
oranges
were
in
season
read
generally
some
piece
of
foreign
literature
for
an
hour
in
his
bedroom
then
bathed
breakfasted
a
light
meal
of
twenty
minutes
sat
by
the
fire
and
read
his
and
till
ten
from
ten
to
one
wrote
in
his
study
or
meditated
with
head
resting
on
his
hand
to
write
a
letter
was
the
reverse
of
a
pleasure
to
him
yet
he
was
diligent
in
replying
to
a
multitude
of
correspondents
his
lunch
at
one
was
of
the
lightest
kind
usually
no
more
than
a
pudding
visits
private
views
of
picture
exhibitions
and
the
like
followed
until
five
at
seven
he
dined
preferring
carlowitz
or
claret
to
other
wines
and
drinking
little
of
any
but
on
many
days
the
dinner
was
not
at
home
once
during
three
successive
weeks
he
dined
out
without
the
omission
of
a
day
he
returned
home
seldom
at
a
later
hour
than
twelve
and
at
seven
next
morning
the
round
began
again
during
his
elder
years
says
mr
grove
he
took
little
interest
in
politics
he
was
not
often
a
but
discussed
religious
matters
earnestly
with
his
clerical
friends
he
loved
not
only
animals
but
flowers
and
when
once
a
virginia
creeper
entered
the
study
window
at
warwick
crescent
it
was
not
expelled
but
trained
inside
the
room
to
his
servants
he
was
a
considerate
friend
rather
than
a
master
so
far
mr
grove
as
reported
in
the
mall
dec
many
persons
have
attempted
to
describe
browning
as
he
appeared
in
society
there
is
a
consensus
of
opinion
as
to
the
energy
and
cordiality
of
his
way
of
social
converse
but
it
is
singular
that
though
some
records
of
his
as
a
talker
exist
very
little
is
on
record
that
possesses
permanent
value
perhaps
the
best
word
that
can
be
quoted
is
that
remembered
by
sir
james
paget
browning
recommendation
of
bach
crucifixus
et
sepultus
et
resurrexit
as
a
cure
for
want
of
belief
he
did
not
fling
such
pointed
shafts
as
those
of
johnson
which
still
hang
and
almost
quiver
where
they
struck
his
energy
did
not
gather
itself
up
into
sentences
but
flowed
and
sometimes
foamed
in
a
tide
cordial
as
he
was
he
could
be
also
vehemently
intolerant
and
sometimes
perhaps
where
his
acquaintance
with
the
subject
of
his
discourse
was
not
sufficient
to
warrant
a
decided
opinion
he
appeared
says
his
biographer
more
widely
sympathetic
in
his
works
than
in
his
life
with
no
moral
selfishness
he
was
adds
mrs
orr
intellectually
and
unquestionably
the
statement
is
correct
he
could
suffer
fools
but
not
always
gladly
speaking
of
earlier
days
in
italy
trollope
observes
that
while
he
was
never
rough
or
discourteous
even
to
the
most
exasperating
fool
the
men
used
to
be
rather
afraid
of
browning
his
cordiality
was
not
insincere
but
it
belonged
to
his
outer
not
his
inner
self
with
the
exception
of
milsand
he
appears
to
have
admitted
no
man
to
his
heart
though
he
gave
a
portion
of
his
intellect
to
many
his
friends
in
the
more
intimate
sense
of
the
word
were
women
towards
whom
his
feeling
was
that
of
comradeship
and
fraternal
affection
without
condescension
or
any
specially
chivalric
sentiment
when
early
in
their
acquaintance
miss
barrett
promised
browning
that
he
would
find
her
an
honest
man
on
the
whole
she
understood
her
correspondent
who
valued
a
good
comrade
of
the
other
sex
and
had
at
the
same
time
a
vivid
sense
of
the
fact
that
such
a
comrade
was
not
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
really
a
man
let
witnesses
be
cited
and
each
give
his
fragment
of
evidence
mr
stillman
an
excellent
observer
was
specially
impressed
in
his
intercourse
with
browning
by
the
mental
health
and
robustness
of
a
nature
sound
to
the
core
an
almost
unlimited
intellectual
vitality
and
an
individuality
which
nothing
could
infringe
on
but
which
a
singular
sensitiveness
towards
others
prevented
from
ever
wounding
even
the
most
morbid
sensibility
a
strong
man
armed
in
the
completest
defensive
armour
but
with
no
aggressiveness
a
writer
in
the
first
volume
of
new
described
browning
as
a
talker
in
general
society
so
faithfully
that
it
is
impossible
to
improve
on
what
he
has
said
it
may
safely
be
alleged
he
writes
that
no
one
meeting
mr
browning
for
the
first
time
and
unfurnished
with
a
clue
would
guess
his
vocation
he
might
be
a
diplomatist
a
statesman
a
discoverer
or
a
man
of
science
but
whatever
were
his
calling
we
should
feel
that
it
must
be
essentially
practical
his
conversation
corresponds
to
his
appearance
it
abounds
in
vigour
in
fire
in
vivacity
yet
all
the
time
it
is
entirely
free
from
mystery
vagueness
or
technical
jargon
it
is
the
crisp
emphatic
and
powerful
discourse
of
a
man
of
the
world
who
is
incomparably
better
informed
than
the
mass
of
his
congeners
mr
browning
is
the
readiest
the
blithest
and
the
most
forcible
of
talkers
like
the
monsignore
in
he
can
with
anecdote
and
blaze
with
repartee
and
when
he
deals
in
criticism
the
edge
of
his
sword
is
mercilessly
whetted
against
pretension
and
vanity
the
inflection
of
his
voice
the
flash
of
his
eye
the
pose
of
his
head
the
action
of
his
hand
all
lend
their
special
emphasis
to
the
condemnation
the
mental
quality
which
most
impressed
mr
rossetti
in
his
communications
with
browning
was
he
says
celerity
whatever
he
had
to
consider
or
speak
about
he
disposed
of
in
the
most
forthright
style
his
method
was
of
the
greatest
directness
every
touch
told
every
nail
was
hit
on
the
head
he
was
not
a
sustained
continuous
speaker
nor
exactly
a
brilliant
one
but
he
said
something
pleasant
and
pointed
on
whatever
turned
up
one
felt
his
mind
to
be
extraordinarily
rich
while
his
facility
accessibility
and
softened
but
did
not
by
any
means
disguise
the
sense
of
his
power
browning
discourse
with
a
single
person
who
was
a
favoured
acquaintance
was
mr
gosse
declares
a
very
much
finer
phenomenon
than
when
a
group
surrounded
him
then
his
talk
assumed
the
volume
and
the
tumult
of
a
cascade
his
voice
rose
to
a
shout
sank
to
a
whisper
ran
up
and
down
the
gamut
of
conversational
melody
in
his
own
study
or
what
he
loved
was
to
capture
the
visitor
in
a
low
of
leather
and
from
a
most
unfair
vantage
of
height
to
tyrannize
to
walk
round
the
victim
in
front
behind
on
this
side
on
that
weaving
magic
circles
now
with
gesticulating
arms
thrown
high
now
grovelling
on
the
floor
to
find
some
reference
in
a
folio
talking
all
the
while
a
redundant
turmoil
of
thoughts
fancies
and
reminiscences
flowing
from
those
generous
lips
mr
henry
james
in
his
life
of
story
is
less
pictorial
but
he
is
characteristically
subtle
in
his
rendering
of
the
facts
he
brings
us
back
however
to
browning
as
seen
in
society
he
speaks
of
the
italian
as
a
comparatively
idyllic
period
which
seemed
to
be
built
out
though
this
was
not
really
the
case
by
the
brilliant
london
period
it
was
he
says
as
if
browning
had
divided
his
personal
consciousness
into
two
independent
compartments
the
man
of
the
world
walked
abroad
showed
himself
talked
right
resonantly
abounded
multiplied
his
connections
did
his
duty
the
poet
an
inscrutable
personage
sat
at
home
and
knew
as
well
he
might
in
what
quarters
of
sphere
to
look
for
suitable
company
the
poet
and
the
of
society
were
in
a
word
dissociated
in
him
as
they
can
rarely
elsewhere
have
been
the
wall
that
built
out
the
idyll
as
we
call
it
for
convenience
of
which
memory
and
imagination
were
virtually
composed
for
him
stood
there
behind
him
solidly
enough
but
subject
to
his
privilege
of
living
almost
equally
on
both
sides
of
it
it
contained
an
invisible
door
through
which
working
the
lock
at
will
he
could
softly
pass
and
of
which
he
kept
the
golden
key
carrying
about
the
same
with
him
even
in
the
pocket
of
his
dinner
waistcoat
yet
even
in
his
most
splendid
expansions
showing
it
happy
man
to
none
tennyson
said
an
acquaintance
of
miss
anna
swanwick
hides
himself
behind
his
laurels
browning
behind
the
man
of
the
world
she
declares
that
her
experience
was
more
fortunate
that
she
seldom
heard
browning
speak
without
feeling
that
she
was
listening
to
the
poet
and
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
spoke
to
her
of
his
wife
but
many
witnesses
confirm
the
impression
which
is
so
happily
put
into
words
by
mr
henry
james
the
member
of
society
protected
the
privacy
of
the
poet
the
questions
remain
whether
the
poet
did
not
suffer
from
such
protection
whether
beside
the
superfluous
forces
which
might
be
advantageously
disposed
of
at
the
or
in
thumping
wet
clay
some
of
the
forces
proper
to
the
poet
were
not
drawn
away
and
dissipated
by
the
incessant
demands
of
society
whether
while
a
sufficient
fund
of
energy
for
the
double
life
was
present
with
browning
the
peculiar
energy
of
the
poet
did
not
undergo
a
certain
deterioration
the
doctrine
of
the
superiority
of
the
heart
to
the
intellect
is
more
and
more
preached
in
browning
poetry
but
the
doctrine
itself
is
an
act
of
the
intellect
the
poet
need
not
perhaps
insist
on
the
doctrine
if
he
creates
as
browning
did
in
earlier
years
beautiful
things
which
commend
themselves
without
a
preacher
to
our
love
in
the
autumn
of
after
seventeen
years
of
absence
from
italy
browning
was
recaptured
by
its
charm
and
henceforward
to
the
close
of
his
life
venice
and
the
venetian
district
became
his
accustomed
place
of
summer
refreshment
and
repose
for
a
time
with
his
sister
as
his
companion
he
paused
at
a
hotel
near
the
summit
of
the
spl√ºgen
enjoyed
the
mountain
air
walked
vigorously
and
wrote
with
great
rapidity
says
mrs
orr
his
poem
of
russia
when
a
boy
he
had
read
in
bunyan
life
and
death
of
mr
badman
the
story
of
old
tod
and
with
this
still
vivid
in
his
memory
he
added
to
his
russian
tale
the
highly
unidyllic
idyl
of
english
life
it
was
thus
that
subjects
for
poems
suddenly
presented
themselves
to
browning
often
rising
up
as
it
were
spontaneously
out
of
the
remote
past
there
comes
up
unexpectedly
he
wrote
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
some
subject
for
poetry
which
has
been
dormant
and
apparently
dead
for
perhaps
dozens
of
years
a
month
since
i
wrote
a
poem
of
some
two
hundred
lines
about
a
story
i
heard
more
than
forty
years
ago
and
never
dreamed
of
trying
to
repeat
wondering
how
it
had
so
long
escaped
me
and
so
it
has
been
with
my
best
things
before
the
close
of
september
the
travellers
were
in
a
rough
but
pleasant
albergo
at
asolo
which
browning
had
not
seen
since
his
first
italian
journey
more
than
forty
years
previously
such
things
he
writes
have
begun
and
ended
with
me
in
the
interval
changes
had
taken
place
in
the
little
city
yet
much
seemed
familiar
and
therefore
the
more
dreamlike
the
place
had
indeed
haunted
him
in
his
dreams
he
would
find
himself
travelling
with
a
friend
or
some
mysterious
stranger
when
suddenly
the
little
town
sparkling
in
the
sunshine
would
rise
before
him
look
look
there
is
asolo
he
would
cry
do
let
us
go
there
and
always
after
the
way
of
dreams
his
companions
would
declare
it
impossible
and
he
would
be
hurried
away
from
the
time
that
he
actually
saw
again
the
city
that
he
loved
this
recurring
dream
was
to
come
no
more
he
wandered
through
the
places
and
seeking
for
an
echo
in
the
rocca
the
ruined
fortress
above
the
town
he
found
that
it
had
not
lost
its
tongue
a
fortnight
at
venice
in
a
hotel
where
quiet
and
coolness
were
the
chief
attractions
prepared
the
way
for
many
subsequent
visits
to
what
he
afterwards
called
the
dearest
place
in
the
world
everything
in
venice
says
mrs
bronson
charmed
him
he
found
grace
and
beauty
in
the
whom
he
paints
so
well
in
the
goldoni
sonnet
the
poorest
street
children
were
pretty
in
his
eyes
he
would
admire
a
carpenter
or
a
painter
who
chanced
to
be
at
work
in
the
house
and
say
to
me
the
fine
poise
of
the
head
those
features
you
might
fancy
that
man
in
the
crimson
robe
of
a
senator
as
you
see
them
in
canvas
but
these
are
reminiscences
of
later
days
it
was
in
that
browning
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
american
friend
mrs
arthur
bronson
whose
kind
hospitalities
added
to
the
happiness
of
his
visits
to
asolo
and
to
venice
who
received
as
if
it
were
a
farewell
gift
the
dedication
of
his
last
volume
and
who
not
long
before
her
death
in
published
interesting
articles
on
browning
in
asolo
and
browning
in
venice
in
century
the
only
years
in
which
he
did
not
revisit
venice
were
and
and
in
each
of
these
years
his
absence
was
occasioned
by
some
unforeseen
in
the
floods
were
out
and
he
proceeded
no
farther
than
verona
could
he
have
overcome
the
obstacles
and
reached
venice
he
feared
that
he
might
have
been
incapable
of
enjoying
it
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
lamed
by
what
he
took
for
an
attack
of
rheumatism
caught
he
says
just
before
leaving
st
pierre
de
chartreuse
through
my
stupid
inadvertence
in
sitting
with
a
window
open
at
my
back
reading
the
iliad
all
my
excuse
while
clad
in
a
thin
summer
suit
and
snow
on
the
hills
and
bitterness
every
where
in
his
sister
illness
at
first
forbade
travel
to
so
considerable
a
distance
the
two
companions
were
received
by
another
american
friend
mrs
bloomfield
moore
at
the
villa
berry
st
moritz
and
when
she
was
summoned
across
the
atlantic
at
her
request
they
continued
to
occupy
her
villa
the
season
was
past
the
place
deserted
but
the
sun
shone
gloriously
we
have
walked
every
day
browning
wrote
at
the
end
of
september
morning
and
evening
afternoon
i
should
say
two
or
three
hours
each
excursion
the
delicious
mountain
air
surpassing
any
i
was
ever
privileged
to
breathe
my
sister
is
absolutely
herself
again
and
something
over
i
was
hardly
in
want
of
such
doctoring
two
years
later
miss
browning
was
ailing
again
and
they
did
not
venture
farther
than
wales
at
the
hand
hotel
llangollen
they
were
at
no
great
distance
from
brintysilio
the
summer
residence
of
their
friends
sir
theodore
and
lady
martin
in
earlier
days
the
lady
carlisle
and
colombe
of
browning
plays
mrs
orr
notices
that
browning
liberal
as
he
declared
himself
was
now
very
favourably
impressed
by
the
services
to
society
of
the
english
country
gentleman
talk
of
abolishing
that
class
of
men
he
exclaimed
they
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
she
adds
as
worthy
of
remark
that
he
attended
regularly
the
afternoon
sunday
service
in
the
parish
church
at
llantysilio
where
now
a
tablet
of
lady
martin
placing
marks
the
spot
churchgoing
was
not
his
practice
in
london
but
i
do
not
think
says
mrs
orr
he
ever
failed
in
it
at
the
universities
or
in
the
country
at
venice
it
was
his
custom
to
be
present
with
his
sister
at
the
services
of
a
waldensian
chapel
where
a
certain
eloquent
pastor
as
mrs
bronson
describes
him
was
the
preacher
a
year
before
his
death
browning
in
a
letter
to
lady
martin
recalls
the
happy
season
in
the
vale
of
llangollen
delightful
weeks
each
tipped
with
a
sweet
starry
sunday
at
the
little
church
leading
to
the
house
beautiful
where
we
took
our
rest
of
an
evening
spent
always
memorably
illustration
the
palazzo
giustiniani
venice
a
drawing
miss
n
erichsen
before
passing
on
to
venice
where
repose
was
mingled
with
excitement
browning
was
accustomed
to
seek
a
renewal
of
physical
energy
after
the
fatigues
of
london
in
some
place
not
too
much
haunted
by
the
english
tourist
where
he
could
walk
for
hours
in
the
clear
mountain
air
in
and
it
was
st
pierre
de
chartreuse
from
which
he
visited
the
grande
chartreuse
and
heard
the
midnight
mass
in
and
it
was
gressoney
st
jean
in
the
val
the
delightful
gressoney
of
the
prologue
to
where
eggs
milk
cheese
fruit
sufficed
for
gormandizing
in
it
was
the
yet
more
beautiful
primiero
near
feltre
in
the
previous
year
he
had
for
the
second
time
stayed
at
st
moritz
these
were
seasons
of
abounding
life
st
pierre
was
only
a
wild
little
clump
of
cottages
on
a
mountain
amid
loftier
mountains
with
the
roughest
of
little
inns
for
its
hotel
but
its
primitive
arrangements
suited
browning
well
and
were
bravely
borne
by
his
sister
from
gressoney
in
september
he
wrote
we
are
all
but
alone
the
brief
being
over
and
only
a
chance
traveller
turning
up
for
a
fortnight
lodging
we
take
our
walks
in
the
old
way
two
and
a
half
hours
before
breakfast
three
after
it
in
the
most
beautiful
country
i
know
yesterday
the
three
hours
passed
without
our
meeting
a
single
man
woman
or
child
one
man
only
was
discovered
at
a
distance
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
we
had
climbed
all
things
pleased
him
an
august
snowstorm
at
st
moritz
was
made
amends
for
by
the
magnificence
of
the
mountain
and
its
firs
black
against
the
universal
white
it
served
moreover
as
an
illustration
of
a
passage
in
the
iliad
the
only
book
that
accompanied
him
from
england
the
days
glide
away
uneventfully
and
i
breathe
in
the
pleasant
idleness
at
every
pore
i
have
no
few
acquaintances
here
nay
some
old
friends
but
my
intimates
are
the
firs
on
the
hillside
and
the
myriad
butterflies
all
about
it
every
bright
wing
of
them
under
the
snow
which
ought
not
to
have
been
for
a
fortnight
yet
and
from
primiero
in
when
his
strength
had
considerably
declined
a
letter
tells
of
unabated
pleasure
of
mountains
which
morning
and
evening
in
turn
transmute
literally
to
gold
with
at
times
a
silver
change
of
the
valley
one
green
luxuriance
of
the
in
the
garden
above
ten
feet
high
every
bloom
and
every
leaf
faultless
and
of
the
captive
fox
most
engaging
of
little
vixens
who
to
great
joy
broke
her
chain
and
escaped
as
each
successive
volume
that
he
published
seemed
to
him
his
best
so
of
his
mountain
places
of
abode
the
last
always
was
the
loveliest
at
venice
for
a
time
the
quiet
albergo
dell
universo
suited
browning
and
his
sister
well
but
when
mrs
bronson
pressed
them
to
accept
the
use
of
a
suite
of
rooms
in
the
palazzo
giustiniani
recanati
and
the
kind
offer
was
accepted
the
gain
was
considerable
and
the
has
historical
associations
dating
from
the
fifteenth
century
which
pleased
browning
imagination
it
was
his
habit
to
rise
early
and
after
a
light
breakfast
to
visit
the
public
gardens
with
his
sister
he
had
many
friends
mrs
bronson
is
our
informant
whose
wants
or
wishes
he
bore
in
mind
the
prisoned
elephant
the
baboon
the
kangaroo
the
marmosets
the
pelicans
the
ostrich
three
times
with
strict
punctuality
he
made
his
rounds
and
then
returned
to
his
apartment
at
noon
appeared
the
second
and
more
substantial
breakfast
at
which
italian
dishes
were
preferred
browning
wrote
passionately
against
the
vivisection
of
animals
and
strenuously
declaimed
against
the
decoration
of
a
hat
with
the
spoils
of
birds
clothed
with
murder
of
his
best
of
harmless
beings
he
praised
god
for
pleasure
as
he
teaches
us
is
praise
by
heartily
enjoying
ortolans
a
dozen
luscious
lumps
provided
by
the
cook
of
the
palace
to
vary
his
own
phrasing
he
was
fed
with
murder
of
his
best
of
harmless
beings
and
laughed
innocently
enough
with
his
good
sister
over
the
delicious
mouthfuls
for
cardinals
as
if
the
pleasure
of
the
eye
in
beauty
gained
at
a
bird
expense
were
more
criminal
than
the
gusto
of
the
tongue
in
lusciousness
curbed
by
piquancy
gained
at
the
expense
of
a
dozen
other
birds
at
three
came
the
gondola
and
it
was
often
directed
to
the
lido
i
walk
even
in
wind
and
rain
for
a
couple
of
hours
on
lido
browning
wrote
when
nearly
seventy
and
enjoy
the
break
of
sea
on
the
strip
of
sand
as
much
as
shelley
did
in
those
old
days
and
to
another
friend
you
do
know
how
absolutely
well
i
am
after
my
walking
not
on
the
mountains
merely
but
on
the
beloved
lido
go
there
if
only
to
stand
and
be
blown
about
by
the
sea
wind
at
one
time
he
even
talked
of
completing
an
unfinished
villa
on
the
lido
from
which
the
divine
sunsets
could
be
seen
but
the
faded
after
the
manner
of
such
dreams
sunsets
however
and
sunrises
never
faded
from
browning
brain
i
will
not
praise
a
cloud
however
bright
says
wordsworth
although
no
one
has
praised
them
more
ardently
than
he
from
pippa
sunrise
to
the
sunrises
of
mornings
when
his
life
drew
towards
its
close
browning
lavished
his
praise
upon
the
scenery
of
the
sky
a
passage
quoted
by
mrs
orr
from
a
letter
written
a
little
more
than
a
year
before
his
death
is
steeped
in
colour
when
becomes
the
prey
of
the
annotating
editor
it
will
illuminate
his
page
every
morning
at
six
i
see
the
sun
rise
my
bedroom
window
commands
a
perfect
view
the
still
grey
lagune
the
few
flying
the
islet
of
giorgio
in
deep
shadow
and
the
clouds
in
a
long
purple
rack
behind
which
a
sort
of
spirit
of
rose
burns
up
till
presently
all
the
rims
are
on
fire
with
gold
and
last
of
all
the
orb
sends
before
it
a
long
column
of
its
own
essence
apparently
so
my
day
begins
the
of
which
this
extract
speaks
were
mrs
bronson
tells
us
a
special
delight
to
browning
on
a
day
of
gales
he
would
stand
at
the
window
and
watch
them
as
they
sailed
to
and
fro
a
sure
sign
of
heavy
storms
in
the
adriatic
to
him
as
he
declared
they
were
even
more
interesting
than
the
doves
of
st
mark
sometimes
his
walks
guided
by
mrs
bronson
daughter
the
best
cicerone
in
the
world
he
said
were
through
the
narrowest
of
the
city
where
he
rejoiced
in
the
discovery
or
what
he
supposed
to
be
discovery
of
some
neglected
stone
of
venice
occasionally
he
examined
curiously
the
monuments
of
the
churches
his
american
friend
tells
at
length
the
story
of
a
search
in
the
church
of
san
niccol√≤
for
the
tomb
of
the
chieftain
salinguerra
of
browning
own
at
times
he
entered
the
shops
and
made
a
purchase
of
some
piece
of
old
furniture
or
tapestry
his
rule
never
to
buy
anything
without
knowing
exactly
what
he
wished
to
do
with
it
must
have
been
interpreted
liberally
for
when
about
to
move
in
june
from
warwick
crescent
to
de
vere
gardens
many
treasures
acquired
in
italy
were
mrs
orr
tells
us
stowed
away
in
the
house
which
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
and
the
latest
bibelot
was
always
the
most
enchanting
like
a
child
with
a
new
toy
says
mrs
bronson
he
would
carry
it
himself
size
and
weight
permitting
into
the
gondola
rejoice
over
his
chance
in
finding
it
and
descant
eloquently
upon
its
intrinsic
merits
thus
or
with
his
son
assistance
came
to
de
vere
gardens
brass
lamps
that
had
hung
in
venetian
chapels
the
silver
jewish
sabbath
lamp
and
the
four
little
heads
the
seasons
after
which
browning
declared
he
would
not
buy
another
thing
for
the
house
returning
from
his
walks
on
the
lido
or
wanderings
through
the
little
he
showed
that
unwise
which
an
unenlightened
masculine
herakles
might
have
shown
for
the
blessedness
of
five
tea
at
dinner
he
was
in
his
toilet
what
mr
henry
james
calls
the
member
of
society
never
the
poet
whose
necktie
is
a
dithyramb
good
sense
was
his
habit
if
not
his
foible
and
why
should
we
deny
ourselves
here
the
pleasure
of
imagining
miss
browning
at
these
pleasant
ceremonies
as
mrs
bronson
describes
her
wearing
beautiful
gowns
of
rich
and
sombre
tints
and
appearing
each
day
in
a
different
and
most
dainty
french
cap
and
quaint
antique
jewels
if
other
guests
were
not
present
sometimes
a
visit
to
the
theatre
followed
the
venetian
comedies
of
gallina
especially
pleased
browning
he
went
to
his
spacious
box
at
the
goldoni
evening
after
evening
and
did
not
fail
to
express
his
thanks
to
his
brother
dramatist
for
the
enjoyment
he
had
received
in
his
of
he
had
expressed
the
melancholy
which
underlies
the
transitory
gaiety
of
life
in
venice
but
he
could
also
remember
its
innocent
gladnesses
without
this
sense
of
melancholy
when
in
the
committee
of
the
goldoni
monument
asked
browning
to
contribute
a
poem
to
their
album
he
immediately
complied
with
the
request
it
was
scribbled
off
according
to
mrs
orr
while
professor
messenger
was
waiting
it
was
ready
the
day
after
the
request
reached
him
says
mrs
bronson
and
was
probably
carefully
thought
out
before
he
put
pen
to
paper

of

yet
all
the
while

of

remained
with
his
native
land
he
could
not
be
happy
without
his
london
daily
paper
mrs
orr
tells
us
how
deeply
interested
he
was
in
the
fortunes
of
the
british
expedition
for
the
relief
of
general
gordon
in
browning
son
for
the
first
time
since
his
childhood
was
in
italy
with
venice
he
was
in
his
father
phrase
simply
infatuated
for
his
son
sake
but
also
with
the
thought
of
a
place
of
retreat
when
perhaps
years
should
bring
with
them
feebleness
of
body
browning
entered
into
treaty
with
the
owner
an
austrian
and
an
absentee
for
the
purchase
of
the
manzoni
palazzo
on
the
grand
canal
he
considered
it
the
most
beautiful
house
in
venice
ruskin
had
described
it
in
the
stones
of
venice
as
a
perfect
and
very
rich
example
of
byzantine
renaissance
it
wholly
captured
the
imagination
of
browning
he
not
only
already
possessed
it
in
his
dream
but
was
busy
opening
new
windows
to
admit
the
morning
sunshine
and
throwing
out
balconies
while
leaving
undisturbed
the
rich
fa√ßade
with
its
medallions
in
coloured
marble
the
dream
was
never
realised
the
vendor
marchese
montecucculi
hoping
to
secure
a
higher
price
drew
back
browning
was
about
to
force
him
by
legal
proceedings
to
fulfil
his
bargain
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
walls
were
cracked
and
the
foundations
were
untrustworthy
to
his
great
mortification
the
whole
scheme
had
to
be
abandoned
it
was
not
until
his
son
in
the
year
after
his
marriage
acquired
possession
of
the
palazzo
rezzonico
a
stately
temple
of
the
rococo
is
mr
henry
best
word
for
it
that
browning
ceased
to
think
with
regret
of
the
lost
manzoni
at
no
time
however
did
he
design
a
voluntary
abandonment
of
his
life
in

when
in
full
expectation
of
becoming
the
owner
of
the
palazzo

he
wrote

xvi
poet
and
teacher
in
old
age
during
the
last
decade
of
his
life
browning
influence
as
a
literary
power
was
assured
the
publication
indeed
of
ring
and
the
in
did
much
to
establish
his
reputation
with
those
readers
who
are
not
watchers
for
a
new
planet
but
revise
their
astronomical
charts
upon
authority
he
noted
with
satisfaction
that
fourteen
hundred
copies
of
were
sold
in
five
days
and
says
of
in
five
months
is
a
good
sale
for
the
likes
of
me
the
later
volumes
were
not
perhaps
more
popular
but
they
sent
readers
to
the
earlier
poems
and
successive
volumes
of
selections
made
these
easily
accessible
that
published
by
moxon
in
and
dedicated
in
words
of
admiration
and
friendship
to
tennyson
by
no
means
equalled
in
value
the
earlier
selections
made
by
john
forster
the
volume
of
dedicated
also
to
tennyson
which
has
been
frequently
reprinted
was
arranged
upon
a
principle
the
reference
of
which
to
the
poems
chosen
is
far
from
clear
by
simply
stringing
together
certain
pieces
browning
wrote
on
the
thread
of
an
imaginary
personality
i
present
them
in
succession
rather
as
the
natural
development
of
a
particular
experience
than
because
i
account
them
the
most
noteworthy
portion
of
my
work
we
can
perceive
that
some
poems
of
love
are
brought
together
and
some
of
art
and
that
the
series
closes
with
poems
of
religious
thought
or
experience
but
such
an
order
is
not
strictly
observed
and
the
imaginary
personality
the
thread
seems
to
be
imaginary
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
yet
it
is
of
interest
to
observe
that
something
of
a
arrangement
was
at
least
designed
a
second
series
of
selections
followed
in
browning
was
accepted
by
many
admirers
not
only
as
a
poet
but
as
a
prophet
tennyson
and
i
seem
now
to
be
regarded
as
the
two
kings
of
brentford
he
said
laughingly
in
the
king
was
soon
to
have
an
interesting
court
in
the
browning
society
founded
by
dr
furnivall
initiator
of
so
much
work
that
is
invaluable
to
the
student
of
our
literature
and
miss
hickey
herself
a
poet
began
its
course
at
first
according
to
mrs
orr
browning
treated
the
project
as
a
joke
but
when
once
he
understood
it
to
be
serious
he
did
not
oppose
it
he
felt
however
that
before
the
public
he
must
stand
aloof
from
its
work
as
wilkes
was
no
wilkeite
he
wrote
to
edmund
yates
i
am
quite
other
than
a
browningite
with
a
little
nervousness
as
to
the
discretion
which
the
society
might
or
might
not
show
he
felt
grateful
for
the
interest
in
his
writings
demonstrated
by
persons
many
of
whom
had
been
unknown
to
him
even
by
name
he
was
always
ready
to
furnish
dr
furnivall
with
a
note
of
facts
or
elucidation
his
old
admirers
had
made
him
somewhat
too
much
of
a
peculiar
and
private
possession
a
propaganda
of
younger
believers
could
not
be
unwelcome
to
one
who
had
for
so
many
years
been
commonly
regarded
as
an
obscure
heretic
not
even
an
heresiarch
of
literature
other
honours
accompanied
his
old
age
in
he
received
the
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
and
again
declined
to
be
nominated
for
the
lord
rectorship
of
the
university
of
st
andrews
next
year
he
accepted
the
honorary
presidency
of
the
five
associated
societies
of
edinburgh
in
he
was
appointed
foreign
correspondent
to
the
royal
academy
a
sinecure
post
rendered
vacant
by
the
death
of
lord
houghton
though
so
vigorous
in
talk
browning
could
not
make
a
public
speech
or
he
shrank
from
such
an
effort
none
of
the
honours
which
he
accepted
were
such
as
to
put
him
to
this
test
during
many
years
he
was
president
of
the
new
shakspere
society
his
veneration
for
shakespeare
is
expressed
in
a
sonnet
entitled
written
for
the
book
of
the
show
held
in
the
albert
hall
may
on
behalf
of
the
fulham
road
hospital
for
women
it
was
not
included
in
the
edition
of
his
works
which
he
was
superintending
during
the
last
two
years
of
his
life
browning
was
not
wholly
uninterested
in
the
attempts
made
to
transfer
the
glory
of
the
shakespearian
drama
to
bacon
he
agreed
with
spedding
that
whatever
else
might
be
a
matter
of
doubt
it
was
certain
that
the
author
of
the
essays
could
not
have
been
the
author
of
the
plays
on
another
question
it
is
perhaps
worth
recording
his
opinion
he
could
see
nothing
of
shakespeare
he
declared
in
the
tragedy
of
in
appeared
and
in
the
following
year
idyls
second
they
differed
in
two
respects
from
the
volumes
of
miscellaneous
poetry
which
browning
had
previously
published
hitherto
the
contents
of
his
collections
of
verse
in
the
main
fell
into
three
groups
poems
which
were
interpretations
of
the
passion
of
love
poems
which
dealt
with
art
and
artists
poems
which
were
inspired
by
the
ideas
and
emotions
of
religion
unless
we
regard
as
a
poem
of
religious
experience
we
may
say
that
these
themes
are
wholly
absent
from
the
secondly
the
short
story
in
verse
for
the
first
time
becomes
predominant
or
rather
excludes
other
forms
and
the
short
story
here
is
in
general
not
romantic
or
fantastic
but
what
we
understand
by
the
word
realistic
the
outward
body
of
the
story
is
in
several
instances
more
built
up
by
cumulative
details
than
formerly
which
gives
it
an
air
of
solidity
or
massiveness
and
is
less
expressed
through
a
swift
selection
of
things
essential
and
this
may
lead
a
reader
to
suppose
that
the
story
is
more
a
narrative
of
external
incidents
than
is
actually
the
case
in
truth
though
the
corporal
rind
of
the
narrative
bulks
upon
our
view
the
poet
remains
essentially
the
psychologist
the
narrative
interest
is
not
evenly
distributed
over
the
whole
as
it
is
in
the
works
of
such
a
writer
as
chaucer
who
loves
narrative
for
its
own
sake
there
is
ordinarily
a
crisis
a
culmination
a
decisive
and
eventful
invasion
or
outbreak
of
spiritual
passion
to
which
we
are
led
up
by
all
that
precedes
it
if
the
poem
should
be
humorous
it
works
up
to
some
humorous
point
or
surprise
the
narrative
is
in
fact
a
picture
that
hangs
from
a
nail
and
the
nail
here
is
some
vivid
moment
of
spiritual
experience
or
else
some
jest
which
also
has
its
crisis
a
question
sometimes
arises
as
to
whether
the
central
motive
is
sufficient
to
bear
the
elaborate
apparatus
for
the
parts
of
the
poem
do
not
always
justify
themselves
except
by
reference
to
their
centre
in
the
case
for
example
of
the
thesis
is
that
a
bad
wife
is
stronger
than
death
the
jest
culminates
at
the
point
where
the
devil
upon
sight
of
his
formidable
spouse
flies
from
the
of
one
who
is
about
to
die
and
thus
allows
his
victim
to
escape
the
imminent
death
the
question
will
the
jest
sustain
a
poem
of
such
length
is
a
fair
one
and
a
reader
will
stretch
a
point
and
say
that
he
has
not
after
all
been
so
ill
amused
which
he
might
also
say
of
an
ingoldsby
legend
but
even
a
reader
will
hardly
return
to
with
pleasure
chaucer
with
as
thin
a
jest
could
have
made
an
admirable
poem
for
the
interest
would
have
been
distributed
by
his
lightness
of
touch
by
his
descriptive
power
by
slyness
by
geniality
by
a
changeful
ripple
of
enjoyment
over
the
entire
piece
with
browning
when
we
have
arrived
at
the
apex
of
the
jest
we
are
fatigued
by
the
climb
and
too
much
out
of
breath
to
be
capable
of
laughter
in
like
manner
few
persons
except
the
browning
enthusiast
who
is
not
responsible
for
his
fervour
will
assert
that
either
the
jest
or
the
frankly
cynical
moral
of
of
compensates
for
the
jolting
in
a
springless
waggon
over
a
rough
road
and
a
long
we
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
magician
who
with
knowledge
uninspired
by
love
has
kicks
and
cuffs
for
his
reward
and
the
acquaintance
of
an
astute
greek
who
at
least
in
his
dream
of
life
imposed
upon
him
by
the
art
of
magic
exploits
the
talents
of
his
friend
pietro
and
gains
the
prize
of
his
astuteness
having
learnt
to
rule
men
by
the
potent
spell
of
cleverness
uncurbed
by
conscience
the
cynicism
is
only
inverted
morality
and
implies
that
the
writer
is
the
reverse
of
cynical
but
it
lacks
the
attractive
flavour
of
a
delicate
cynicism
which
insinuates
its
prophylactic
virus
into
our
veins
and
the
humour
of
the
poem
ascending
from
stage
to
stage
until
we
reach
pietro
final
failure
is
cumbrous
and
mechanical
the
two
series
of
included
some
conspicuous
successes
the
classical
poems
and
idyls
heroic
and
mythological
invite
us
by
their
beauty
to
return
to
them
again
and
again
browning
sympathy
with
gallantry
in
action
with
to
a
worthy
cause
was
never
more
vividly
rendered
than
in
the
first
of
these
poems
the
runner
of
athens
is
a
more
graceful
brother
of
the
breton
sailor
who
saved
a
fleet
for
france
but
the
vision
of
majestical
pan
in
the
cool
of
a
cleft
exalts
our
human
heroism
into
relation
with
the
divine
benevolence
and
the
reward
of
release
from
labour
is
proportionally
higher
than
a
holiday
with
the
belle
aurore
victory
and
then
domestic
love
is
the
human
interpretation
of
pan
oracular
promise
but
the
gifts
of
the
gods
are
better
than
our
hopes
and
it
proves
to
be
victory
and
death
he
flung
down
his
shield
ran
like
fire
once
more
and
the
space
the
and
athens
was
stubble
again
a
field
which
a
fire
runs
through
till
in
he
broke
rejoice
we
conquer
like
wine
through
clay
joy
in
his
blood
bursting
his
heart
he
died
the
bliss
the
companion
poem
of
marathon
the
story
of
the
nameless
clown
the
mysterious
holder
of
the
ploughshare
is
not
less
inspiring
the
unknown
champion
so
plain
in
his
heroic
magnitude
of
mind
so
brilliant
as
he
flashes
in
the
van
in
the
rear
is
like
the
incarnated
genius
of
the
soil
which
hides
itself
in
the
furrow
and
flashes
into
the
harvest
and
it
is
his
glory
to
be
obscured
for
ever
by
his
deed
the
great
deed
grows
small
browning
development
of
the
vergilian
myth
si
credere
dignum
est
of
pan
and
luna
astonishes
by
its
vehement
sensuousness
and
its
frank
chastity
and
while
the
beauty
of
the
and
the
terror
of
her
betrayal
are
realised
with
the
utmost
energy
of
imagination
we
are
made
to
feel
that
all
which
happens
is
the
transaction
of
a
significant
dream
or
legend
in
contrast
with
these
classical
pieces
and
reads
like
a
fragment
from
some
scandinavian
saga
telling
of
the
life
of
forlorn
and
monstrous
creatures
who
are
less
men
than
beasts
yet
father
and
son
are
indeed
men
the
remorse
which
checks
the
last
outrage
against
paternity
is
the
touch
of
the
finger
of
god
upon
human
hearts
and
though
old
halbert
sits
dead
with
an
outburst
blackening
still
the
old
bad
fighting
face
and
young
hob
henceforth
goes
tottering
muttering
mumbling
with
a
mindless
docility
they
are
like
browning
men
of
the
paris
morgue
only
apparent
failures
there
was
in
them
that
spark
of
divine
illumination
which
can
never
be
wholly
extinguished
positive
misdeeds
the
presence
of
a
wild
crew
of
evil
passions
do
not
suffice
to
make
browning
faith
or
hope
falter
it
is
the
absence
of
human
virtue
which
appals
him
if
the
salt
have
lost
its
savour
wherewith
shall
it
be
salted
this
it
is
which
condemns
to
a
swift
and
what
the
poem
represents
as
a
just
abolishment
from
earth
the
mother
who
in
has
given
her
children
to
the
wolves
and
has
thereby
proved
the
complete
nullity
of
her
womanhood
for
her
there
is
no
possible
redemption
she
must
cease
to
cumber

a
letter
to

is
a
story
of
remorse
and
there
is
something
approaching
the
supernatural
and
yet
terribly
real
in
the
figure
of
the
strange
old
man
with
a
beard
as
white
as

standing
on

in

one
instant
failure
in

probation
of
life
one
momentary
syncope
of
his

nature
long

ago
has
condemned
his
whole
to
become
a
climbing
of
the
purgatorial
mount

an
agony
of
pain

renewed
at
the
season

delicate
spirit

capable

such
a
perennial
passion
of
penitence
may
be
described
as

but
a
contrasted
piece
it
is
a
story
of
sudden
conversion
and
of
penitence
taking
an
immediate
and
highly
effective
form
the
humour
of
the
poem
which
is
excellent
of
its
kind
resembles
more
the
humour
of
rowlandson
than
that
of

the
bedford

house
on

sweltering
midsummer

the

his
slut
of

these
are
drawn
after
the
broad
british
style
of
humorous
illustration
which
combines
a
frank
exaggeration
of
the
characteristic
lines
with
at
times
a
certain
grace
in
deformity
here
at
least
is
downright
belief
in
the
invisible
here
is
genuine
conviction
driven
home
by
the
spirit
of
god
and
the
terror
of
black
ned
and
the
slut
tabby
as
yet
may
not
seem
the
most
suitable
additions
to
the
company
of
the
blessed
who
move
singing
in
solemn
troops
and
sweet
societies
but
when
a
pair
of
lusty
sinners
desire
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
hanged
and
that
forthwith
we
may
take
it
that
they
are
resolved
as
christmas
was
to
quit
the
city
of
destruction
and
the
saints
above
have
learnt
not
to
be
fastidious
as

rogues

their
lives
and
in
their
death
they
were
not
divided
a
wise
economy
of
spiritual
force
for
while
their
effectual
calling
can
not
be
gainsaid
the
final
perseverance
of
these
interesting
converts
had
they
lingered
on
the
pilgrims

as
ned
is
painfully
aware
might
have
been

of

certainty
browning
method
as
a
may
be
studied
with
special
advantage
in
the
circumstances
under
which
the
tale
is
related
have
to
be
caught
at
by
the
reader
which
quickens
his
attention
and
keeps
him
on
the
alert
this
device
is
of
course
not
in
itself
difficult
but
to
employ
it
with
success
is
an
achievement
requiring
skill
it
is
a
device
proper
to
the
dramatic
or
form
the
speaker
who
is
by
no
means
a
clive
has
to
betray
something
of
his
own
character
and
at
the
same
time
to
set
forth
the
character
of
the
hero
of
his
tale
the
narrative
must
tend
to
a
moment
of
culmination
a
crisis
and
that
this
should
involve
a
paradox
clive
fear
in
the
present
instance
being
not
that
the
antagonist
pistol
presented
at
his
head
should
be
discharged
but
rather
that
it
should
be
remorsefully
or
contemptuously
flung
away
gives
the
poet
an
opportunity
for
some
subtle
or
some
passionate
casuistry
the
effect
of
the
whole
is
that
of
a
stream
or
a
shock
from
an
electric
battery
of
mind
for
which
the
story
serves
as
a
conductor
it
is
not
a
simple
but
a
highly
complex
species
of
narrative
in
one
of
the
most
delightful
of
browning
later
poems
uniting
as
it
does
the
poetry
of
the
rapture
of
swift
motion
with
the
poetry
of
passion
the
narrative
leads
up
to
a
supreme
moment
and
this
resolves
itself
through
a
paradox
of
the
heart
shall
h√≥seyn
recover
his
stolen
pearl
of
a
steed
but
recover
her
dishonoured
in
the
race
or
abandon
her
to
the
captor
with
her
glory
untarnished
it
is
he
himself
who
betrays
himself
to
loss
and
grief
for
to
perfect
love
pride
in
the
supremacy
of
the
beloved
is
more
than
possession
and
thus
as
clive
fear
was
courage
as
violation
of
law
was
obedience
to
law
so
h√≥seyn
loss
is
gain
in
each
case
browning
casuistry
is
not
argumentative
it
lies
in
an
appeal
to
some
passion
or
some
intuition
that
is
above
our
common
levels
of
passion
or
of
insight
and
his
power
of
uplifting
his
reader
for
even
a
moment
into
this
higher
mood
is
his
special
gift
as
a
poet
we
can
return
safely
enough
to
the
common
ground
but
we
return
with
a
possession
which
instructs
the
heart
a
mood
of
acquiescence
which
does
not
displace
the
moods
of
aspiration
and
of
combat
but
rather
floats
above
them
as
an
atmosphere
was
growing
familiar
to
browning
in
these
his
elder
years
he
had
sought
for
truth
and
had
now
found
all
that
earth
was
likely
to
yield
him
of
which
not
the
least
important
part
was
a
conviction
that
much
of
our
supposed
knowledge
ends
in
a
perception
of
our
ignorance
he
was
now
disposed
to
accept
what
seemed
to
be
the
providential
order
that
truth
and
error
should
mingle
in
our
earthly
life
that
truth
should
be
served
by
illusion
he
would
not
rearrange
the
disposition
of
things
if
he
could
he
was
inclined
to
hold
by
the
simple
certainties
of
our
present
life
and
to
be
content
with
these
as
provisional
truths
or
as
temporary
illusions
which
lead
on
towards
the
truth
in
the
of
the
volume
he
had
imagined
this
mood
of
acquiescence
as
belonging
to
the
hour
of
death
but
old
age
in
reality
is
an
earlier
stage
in
the
process
of
dying
and
with
all
his
ardour
and
his
energy
browning
was
being
detached
from
the
contentions
and
from
some
of
the
hopes
and
aspirations
of
life
and
because
he
was
detached
he
could
take
the
world
to
his
heart
though
in
a
different
temper
from
that
of
youth
or
middle
age
he
could
limit
his
view
to
things
that
are
near
because
their
claim
upon
his
passions
had
diminished
while
their
claim
upon
his
tenderness
had
increased
he
could
smile
amiably
for
to
the
mood
of
acquiescence
a
smile
seems
to
be
worth
more
than
an
argument
he
could
recall
the
thoughts
of
love
and
reanimate
them
in
his
imagination
and
could
love
love
with
the
devotion
of
an
old
man
to
the
most
precious
of
the
things
that
have
been
some
of
an
old
man
jests
may
be
found
in
some
of
an
old
man
imaginative
passion
in
and
in
both
volumes
and
still
more
clearly
in
may
be
seen
an
old
man
spirit
of
acquiescence
or
to
use
a
of
matthew
arnold
the
epoch
of
concentration
which
follows
an
epoch
of
expansion
but
the
embrace
of
earth
and
the
things
of
earth
is
like
the
embrace
with
a
pathos
in
its
ardour
which
precedes
a
farewell
from
the
first
he
had
recognised
the
danger
on
the
one
hand
of
settling
down
to
browse
contentedly
in
the
paddock
of
our
earthly
life
and
on
the
other
hand
the
danger
of
ignoring
our
limitations
the
danger
of
attempting
to
thrust
in
earth
eternity
concerns
in
his
earlier
years
he
had
chiefly
feared
the
first
of
these
two
dangers
and
even
while
pointing
out
as
in
the
errors
of
the
seeker
for
absolute
knowledge
or
for
absolute
love
he
had
felt
a
certain
sympathy
with
such
glorious
transgressors
he
had
valued
more
than
any
positive
acquisitions
of
knowledge
those
grasps
of
guess
which
pull
the
more
into
the
less
now
such
guesses
such
hopes
were
as
precious
to
him
as
ever
but
he
set
more
store
than
formerly
by
the
certainties
certainties
even
if
illusions
of
the
general
heart
of
man
these
are
the
forms
of
thought
and
feeling
divinely
imposed
upon
us
we
can
not
do
better
than
to
accept
them
but
we
must
accept
them
only
as
provisional
as
part
of
our
education
on
earth
as
a
needful
rung
of
the
ladder
by
which
we
may
climb
to
higher
things
and
the
faith
which
leads
to
such
acquiescence
also
results
in
the
acceptance
of
hopes
as
things
not
be
struggled
for
but
rested
in
as
a
substantial
portion
of
the
divine
order
of
our
lives
in
autumn

for

rightly
attuned
these
pellucid
halcyon
days
of
the
indian
summer
in

in

year
he
shows
nothing
of
his
boisterous
humour
but
smiles
at
our
human
infirmities
from
the
heights
of
experience
the
prop
of
israel
the
master
eximious
jochanan
ben
sabbathai
when
his
last
hour
is
at
hand
has
to
confess
that
all
his
wisdom
of
life
lies
in
his
theoric
in
practice
he
is
still
an
infant
striving
presumptuously
in
boyhood
to
live
an
angel
now
that
he
comes
to
die
he
is
hardly
a
man
and
solomon
himself
is
no
more
than
man
the
ring
extorts
the
confession
that
an
itch
of
vanity
still
tickles
and
teazes
him

queen

for

jests
at
the
ironies
of
life
browning
best
gifts
in
this
volume
that
looks
pale
beside
its
predecessors
are
one
or
two
short
lyrics
of
love
which
continue
the
series
of
his
latest
lyrical
poems
begun
in
the
exquisite
prologue
to
and
the
graceful
epilogue
to
two
poets
of
and
continued
in
the
songs
of
and
not
the
least
valuable
part
of
the
work
of
his
elder
years
his
strength
in
this
volume
of
is
put
into
that
protest
of
human
righteousness
against
immoral
conceptions
of
the
deity
uttered
by
ixion
from
his
wheel
of
torture
rather
than
obey
an
immoral
supreme
power
as
john
stuart
mill
put
it
to
hell
i
will
go
and
such
is
the
cry
of
victim
of
zeus
he
is
aware
that
in
his
recognition
of
righteousness
he
is
himself
superior
to
the
evil
god
who
afflicts
him
and
as
this
righteousness
is
a
moral
quality
and
no
creation
of
his
own
consciousness
but
rather
imposed
upon
it
as
an
eternal
law
he
rises
past
zeus
to
the
potency
above
him
after
which
even
the
undeveloped
sense
of
a
caliban
blindly
felt
when
he
discovered
a
quiet
above
the
bitter
god
setebos
but
the
quiet
of
caliban
is
a
negation
of
those
evil
attributes
of
the
supreme
being
which
he
reflects
upwards
from
his
own
gross
heart
not
the
energy
of
righteousness
which
ixion
demands
in
his
transcendent
potency
into
this
poem
went
the
energy
of
heart
and
imagination
some
of
his
matured
wisdom
entered
into
of
which
however
the
contents
are
insufficient
to
sustain
the
length
the
saint
and
sage
of
israel
has
at
the
close
of
his
life
found
no
solution
of
the
riddle
of
existence
lover
bard
soldier
statist
he
has
obtained
in
each
of
his
careers
only
doubts
and
dissatisfaction
twelve
months
added
to
a
long
life
by
the
generosity
of
his
admirers
each
of
whom
surrenders
a
fragment
of
his
own
life
to
prolong
that
of
the
saint
bring
him
no
clearer
illumination
still
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
only
at
the
last
when
by
some
unexpected
chance
a
final
opportunity
of
surveying
the
past
and
anticipating
the
future
is
granted
him
all
has
become
clear
instead
of
trying
to
solve
the
riddle
he
accepts
it
he
sees
from
his
pisgah
how
life
with
all
its
confusions
and
contrarieties
is
the
school
which
educates
the
soul
and
fits
it
for
further
wayfaring
the
ultimate
faith
of
jochanan
the
saint
had
been
already
expressed
by
browning
over
the
ball
of
it
peering
and
prying
how
i
see
all
of
it
life
there
outlying
roughness
and
smoothness
shine
and
defilement
grace
and
uncouthness
one
reconcilement
but
even
to
his
favourite
disciple
the
sage
is
unable
so
to
impart
the
secret
that
tsaddik
mind
shall
really
embrace
it
the
spirit
of
the
saint
of
israel
is
also
the
spirit
of
that
wise
dervish
of
browning
invention
the
persian
ferishtah
the
volume
is
frankly
didactic
and
browning
as
becomes
a
master
who
would
make
his
lessons
easy
to
children
teaches
by
parables
and
pictures
in
reading
we
might
suppose
that
we
were
in
the
interpreter
house
and
that
the
interpreter
himself
was
pointing
a
moral
with
the
robin
that
has
a
spider
in
his
mouth
or
the
hen
walking
in
a
fourfold
method
towards
her
chickens
the
discourses
of
the
dervish
are
in
the
main
theological
or
philosophical
the
lyrics
which
are
interposed
between
the
discourses
or
discussions
are
amatory
in
persian
poetry
much
that
at
first
sight
might
be
taken
for
amatory
has
in
its
inner
meaning
a
mystical
theological
sense
browning
reverses
the
order
of
such
poetry
he
gives
us
first
his
doctrine
concerning
life
or
god
and
gives
it
clothed
in
a
parable
then
in
a
lyric
the
subject
is
retracted
into
the
sphere
of
human
affections
and
the
truth
of
theology
condenses
itself
into
a
corresponding
truth
respecting
the
love
of
man
and
woman
throughout
the
series
of
poems
it
is
not
a
persian
dervish
who
is
the
speaker
and
teacher
we
hear
the
authentic
voice
of
the
dervish
born
in
camberwell
in
the
year
the
doctrine
set
forth
is
the
doctrine
of
browning
the
manner
of
speech
is
the
manner
of
the
poet
the
illustrations
and
imagery
are
often
oriental
the
ideas
are
those
of
a
western
thinker
yet
no
sense
of
discordance
is
produced
the
parable
of
the
starving
ravens
fed
by
an
eagle
serves
happily
as
an
induction
let
us
become
not
waiters
on
providence
but
workers
with
providence
and
to
feed
hungry
souls
is
even
more
needful
than
to
feed
hungry
bodies
i
starve
in
soul
so
may
mankind
and
since
men
congregate
in
towns
not
woods
to
ispahan
forthwith
such
is
the
lesson
of
energetic
charity
and
the
lesson
for
the
acceptance
of
providential
gifts
is
that
put
in
words
by
the
poor
once
the
shah
prime
minister
words
spoken
in
the
spirit
of
the
afflicted
job
shall
we
receive
good
at
the
hand
of
god
and
shall
we
not
receive
evil
or
rather
shall
not
our
hearts
even
in
the
midst
of
evil
be
lifted
up
in
gratitude
at
the
remembrance
of
the
good
which
we
have
received
browning
proceeds
under
a
transparent
veil
of
oriental
fable
to
consider
the
story
of
the
life
of
christ
do
we
believe
in
that
tale
of
wonder
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
belief
the
more
it
really
concerns
us
the
more
exacting
grow
our
demands
for
evidence
of
its
truth
an
otiose
assent
is
easy
but
this
has
none
of
the
potency
of
genuine
conviction
and
after
all
intellectual
assent
is
of
little
importance
compared
with
that
love
for
the
divine
which
may
as
truly
with
denial
as
with
assent
sets
forth
through
a
parable
the
wisdom
of
accepting
and
living
in
our
human
views
of
things
transcendent
why
pray
to
god
at
all
why
not
rather
accept
his
will
and
his
providential
disposition
of
our
lives
as
absolutely
wise
and
right
that
browning
replies
may
be
the
way
of
the
angels
we
are
men
and
it
is
god
will
that
we
should
feel
and
think
as
men
be
man
and
nothing
more
man
who
as
man
conceiving
hopes
and
fears
and
craves
and
deprecates
and
loves
and
loathes
and
bids
god
help
him
till
death
touch
his
eyes
and
show
god
granted
most
denying
all
the
same
spirit
of
acceptance
of
our
intellectual
and
moral
limitations
is
applied
in
to
the
defence
of
anthropomorphic
religion
our
spirit
burdened
with
the
good
gifts
of
life
looks
upward
for
relief
in
gratitude
and
praise
but
we
can
praise
and
thank
only
one
who
is
righteous
and
loving
as
we
conceive
righteousness
and
love
let
us
not
strive
to
pass
beyond
these
human
feelings
and
conceptions
perhaps
they
are
wholly
remote
from
the
unknown
reality
they
are
none
the
less
the
conceptions
proper
to
humanity
we
have
no
capacities
with
which
to
correct
them
let
us
hold
fast
by
our
human
best
and
preserve
as
the
preacher
very
correctly
expressed
it
the
integrity
of
our
anthropomorphism
the
magnified
man
and
the
three
lord
shaftesburys
of
matthew
arnold
irony
are
regarded
with
no
fine
scorn
by
the
intellect
of
browning
his
early
christian
faith
has
expanded
and
taken
the
form
of
a
humanitarian
theism
courageously
accepted
not
as
a
complete
account
of
the
unknowable
but
as
the
best
provisional
conception
which
we
are
competent
to
form
this
theism
involves
rather
than
displaces
the
truth
shadowed
forth
in
the
life
of
christ
the
crudest
theism
would
seem
to
him
far
more
reasonable
than
to
direct
the
religious
emotions
towards
a
stream
of
tendency
the
presence
of
evil
in
a
world
created
and
governed
by
one
is
justified
in
as
a
necessity
of
our
education
how
shall
love
be
called
forth
unless
there
be
the
possibility
of
how
shall
our
human
sympathy
be
perfected
unless
there
be
pain
what
room
is
there
for
thanks
to
god
or
love
of
man
if
earth
be
the
scene
of
such
a
blank
monotony
of
as
may
be
found
in
the
star
rephan
but
let
us
not
call
evil
good
or
think
pain
in
itself
a
gain
god
may
see
that
evil
is
null
and
that
pain
is
gain
for
us
the
human
view
the
human
feeling
must
suffice
this
justification
of
pain
as
a
needful
part
of
an
education
is
however
inapplicable
to
retributive
punishment
such
a
theological
horror
browning
rejects
with
a
hearty
indignation
qualified
only
by
a
humorous
contempt
in
his
apologue
of
her
driver
if
the
camel
bites
will
with
good
cause
thwack
and
so
instruct
the
brute
that
mouths
should
munch
not
bite
he
will
not
six
months
afterwards
thrust
prongs
into
the
soft
of
her
flesh
to
hiss
there
and
god
has
the
advantage
over
the
driver
of
seeing
into
the
camel
brain
and
of
knowing
precisely
what
moved
the
creature
to
offend
the
poem
which
follows
is
directed
against
asceticism
for
the
sake
of
our
fellows
is
indeed
joy
beyond
joy
as
to
the
rest
the
question
is
not
whether
we
fast
or
feast
but
whether
fasting
or
feasting
we
do
our
day
work
for
the
master
if
we
would
supply
joy
to
our
fellows
it
is
needful
that
we
should
first
know
joy
ourselves
therefore
desire
joy
and
thank
god
for
it
browning
argument
is
not
profound
and
could
adroitly
be
turned
against
himself
but
his
temperament
would
survive
his
argument
his
capacity
for
manifold
pleasures
was
great
and
he
not
only
valued
these
as
good
in
themselves
but
turned
them
to
admirable
uses
a
feast
of
the
senses
was
to
him
as
spiritually
precious
as
a
fast
might
be
to
one
who
only
by
fasting
could
attain
to
higher
joys
than
those
of
sense
and
this
he
would
maintain
is
a
better
condition
for
a
human
being
than
that
which
renders
expedient
the
plucking
out
of
an
eye
the
cutting
off
of
a
hand
joy
for
browning
means
praise
and
gratitude
and
in
recognising
the
occasions
for
such
praise
and
thanks
let
us
not
wind
ourselves
too
high
let
us
praise
god
for
the
little
things
that
are
so
considerately
fitted
to
our
little
human
wants
and
desires
the
will
sing
together
without
our
help
if
we
must
choose
our
moment
for
a
let
it
be
when
we
have
enjoyed
our
plate
of
cherries
the
glorious
lamp
in
the
shah
pavilion
lightens
other
eyes
than
mine
but
to
think
that
the
shah
goodness
has
provided
slippers
for
my
feet
in
my
own
small
chamber
and
of
the
very
colour
that
i
most
affect
nor
in
returning
thanks
should
it
cause
us
trouble
that
our
best
thanks
are
poor
or
even
that
they
are
mingled
with
an
alloy
of
earthly
regards
mere
man
motives
alas
friend
what
was
free
from
this
alloy
some
smatch
thereof
in
best
and
purest
love
preferred
thy
earthly
father
dust
thou
art
dust
shall
be
to
the
end
our
little
human
pleasures
do
they
seem
unworthy
to
meet
the
eye
of
god
that
is
a
question
put
by
distrust
and
spiritual
pride
god
gives
each
of
us
his
little
plot
within
which
each
of
us
is
master
the
question
is
not
what
compost
what
manure
makes
fruitful
the
soil
we
need
not
report
to
the
lord
of
the
soil
the
history
of
our
manures
let
us
treat
the
ground
as
seems
best
if
only
we
bring
sacks
to
his
granary
in
autumn
nay
do
not
i
also
tickle
the
palate
of
my
ass
with
a
so
heartening
him
to
do
his
work
in
pillar
at
confronts
the
objection
that
he
has
deposed
knowledge
and
degraded
humanity
to
the
rank
of
an
ass
whose
highest
attainment
is
to
love
what
husked
lupines
and
belike
the
feeder
self
the
dervish
declares
without
shrinking
the
faith
that
is
in

ferishtah
all
i
seem
to
know
is
i
know
nothing
save
that

i
can
boundlessly
endlessly
illustration
if
there
be
knowledge
it
shall
vanish
away
but
charity
never
faileth
as
for
knowledge
the
prize
is
in
the
process
as
gain
we
must
mistrust
it
not
as
a
road
to
gain
knowledge
means
assurance
by
defeat
that
victory
is
somehow
still
to
reach
but
love
is
victory
the
prize
itself
grasping
at
the
sun
a
child
captures
an
orange
what
if
he
were
to
scorn
his
capture
and
refuse
to
suck
its
juice
the
curse
of
life
is
this
that
every
supposed
accession
to
knowledge
every
novel
theory
is
accepted
as
a
complete
solution
of
the
whole
problem
while
every
pleasure
is
despised
as
transitory
or
insubstantial
in
truth
the
drop
of
water
found
in
the
desert
sand
is
infinitely
precious
the
mirage
is
only
a
mirage
browning
who
in
this
volume
puts
forth
his
own
doctrine
of
theism
his
justification
of
prayer
his
belief
in
a
superintending
providence
his
explanation
of
the
presence
of
evil
in
the
world
is
of
course
no
pyrrhonist
he
profoundly
distrusts
the
capacity
of
the
intellect
acting
as
a
pure
organ
of
speculation
to
unriddle
the
mysteries
of
existence
he
maintains
on
the
other
hand
that
knowledge
sufficient
for
the
conduct
of
our
lives
is
involved
in
the
simple
experiences
of
good
and
evil
of
joy
and
sorrow
in
reality
attitude
towards
truth
approaches
more
nearly
what
has
now
begun
to
style
itself
pragmatism
than
it
approaches
pyrrhonism
but
philosophers
whose
joy
is
to
beat
the
air
may
find
that
it
is
condemnatory
of
their
methods
in
his
distrust
of
metaphysical
speculation
and
in
regarding
the
affections
as
superior
to
the
intellect
browning
as
a
teacher
has
something
in
common
with
comte
but
there
is
perhaps
no
creed
so
alien
to
his
nature
as
the
creed
of
positivism
the
last
of
discourses
is
concerned
with
the
proportion
which
happiness
bears
to
pain
in
the
average
life
of
man
or
rather
for
browning
is
nothing
if
he
is
not
individualistic
in
the
life
of
each
man
as
an
individual
the
conclusion
arrived
at
is
that
no
each
bean
white
or
black
standing
for
a
day
is
wholly
black
and
that
the
more
extended
is
our
field
of
vision
the
more
is
the
general
aspect
of
the
of
a
colour
intermediate
between
the
extremes
of
darkness
and
of
light
before
the
poem
closes
browning
turns
aside
to
consider
the
positivist
position
why
give
our
thanks
and
praise
for
all
the
good
things
of
life
to
god
whose
existence
is
an
inference
of
the
heart
derived
from
its
own
need
of
rendering
gratitude
to
some
being
like
ourselves
are
not
these
good
things
the
gifts
of
the
race
of
humanity
and
its
worthies
who
have
preceded
us
and
who
at
the
present
moment
constitute
our
environment
of
loving
help
ferishtah
reply
which
is
far
from
conclusive
must
be
regarded
as
no
discussion
of
the
subject
but
the
utterance
of
an
isolated
thought
praise
rendered
to
humanity
and
the
heroes
of
the
race
simply
reverts
to
the
giver
of
the
praise
his
own
perceptions
of
what
is
praiseworthy
alone
render
praise
possible
he
must
first
of
all
thank
and
praise
the
giver
of
such
perceptions
god
it
is
strange
that
browning
should
fail
to
recognise
the
fact
that
the
positivist
would
immediately
trace
the
power
of
moral
perception
to
the
energies
of
humanity
in
its
upward
progress
from
primitive
savagery
to
our
present
state
of
imperfect
development
it
has
been
necessary
to
transcribe
in
a
reduced
form
the
teaching
of
ferishtah
for
this
is
the
clearest
record
left
by
browning
of
his
own
beliefs
on
the
most
important
of
all
subjects
this
is
an
essential
part
of
his
criticism
of
life
and
at
the
same
time
it
is
little
less
than
a
passage
of
autobiography
the
poems
are
admirable
in
their
vigour
their
humour
their
seriousness
their
felicity
of
imagery
yet
the
wisdom
of
is
an
old
man
wisdom
we
perceive
in
it
the
inner
life
as
baxter
puts
it
in
speaking
of
changes
wrought
by
his
elder
years
quitting
the
leaves
and
branches
and
drawing
down
to
the
root
but
when
in
prologue
or
epilogue
to
this
volume
or
that
browning
touches
upon
the
great
happiness
the
great
sorrow
of
his
own
life
he
is
always
young
here
the
lyrical
epilogue
is
inspired
by
a
noble
enthusiasm
and
closes
with
a
surprise
of
beauty
what
if
all
his
happy
faith
in
the
purpose
of
life
and
the
divine
presence
through
all
its
course
were
but
a
reflex
from
the
private
and
personal
love
that
had
once
been
his
and
was
still
above
and
around
him
such
a
doubt
contained
its
own
refutation
only
at
heart
utmost
joy
and
triumph
terror
sudden
turns
the
blood
to
ice
a
chill
wind
disencharms
all
the
late
enchantment
what
if
all
be
error
if
the
halo
irised
round
my
head
were
love
thine
arms
all
the
more
if
this
were
so
must
the
speaker
heart
turn
godwards
in
gratitude
the
whole
design
of
the
volume
with
its
theological
parables
and
its
beautiful
lyrics
of
human
love
implies
that
there
is
a
correspondency
between
the
truths
of
religion
and
the
truths
of
the
passion
of
love
between
man
and
woman

horrible

days
with
certain
people
of
importance
in
their
published
in
browning
last
volume
but
one
betrays
not
the
slightest
decline
in
his
mental
vigour
it
suffers
however
from
the
fact
that
several
of
the
parleyings
are
discussions
emotional
it
is
true
as
well
as
intellectual
of
somewhat
abstract
themes
that
these
discussions
are
often
prolonged
beyond
what
the
subject
requires
and
that
the
people
of
importance
are
in
some
instances
not
men
and
women
but
mere
to
throw
out
browning
own
voice
when
certain
aspects
or
principles
of
art
are
considered
in
lippo
before
us
stands
brother
lippo
himself
a
living
breathing
figure
on
whom
our
interest
must
needs
fasten
whatever
may
be
the
subject
of
his
discourse
there
is
of
course
a
propriety
in
connecting
a
debate
on
evil
in
the
world
as
a
means
to
good
with
the
name
of
the
author
of
the
fable
of
the
bees
there
is
no
impropriety
in
connecting
a
study
of
the
philosophy
of
music
with
the
name
of
charles
avison
the
newcastle
organist
but
we
do
not
make
acquaintance
through
the
parleyings
with
either
avison
or
mandeville
this
objection
does
not
apply
to
all
the
poems
the
parleying
daniel
is
a
story
of
love
and
loss
admirable
in
its
presentation
of
the
heroine
and
the
unheroic
hero

are
interested
in
francis
furini

priest

man
good
painter
before
he
begins
to
preach
his
somewhat
portentous
sermon
on
evolution
and
in
the
case
of
christopher
smart
the
question
why
once
and
only
once
he
was
a
divinely
inspired
singer
is
the
question
which
most
directly
leads
to
a
disclosure
of
his
character
as
a
poet
the
volume
however
as
a
whole
while
browning
energy
never
flags
has
a
larger
proportion
than
its
predecessors
of
what
he
himself
terms
mere
grey
argument
and
as
if
to
compensate
this
it
is
remarkable
for
sudden
outbursts
of
imagination
and
passion
as
if
these
repressed
for
a
time
had
carried
away
the
dykes
and
dams
and
went
on
their
career

in

opening
of
these
are
sufficient
evidence
of
the
abounding
force
of
browning
genius
as
a
poet
at
a
date
when
he
had
passed
the
three
score
years
and
ten
by
half
an
added

nor
would
we
willingly

you
reds
and

and

of
failure
in
intellectual
or
imaginative
force
the
show
no
symptom
but
the
vigour
of
browning
will
did
a
certain
wrong
to
his
other
powers
he
did
not
wait
as
in
early
days
for
the
genuine
casual
inspirations
of
pleasure
he
made
it
his
task
to
work
out
all
that
was
in
him
and
what
comes
to
a
writer
of
genius
is
better
than
what
is
laboriously
sought
we
may
gather
wood
for
the
altar
but
the
true
fire
must
descend
from

the
speed
and
excitement
kindled
by
one
own
exertions
are
very
different
from
the
varying
stress
of
a
wind
that
bears
one
onward
without
the
thump
and
rattle
of
the
it
would
have
been
a
gain
if
browning
indomitable
had
occasionally
ceased
to
ply
and
he
had
been
compelled
to
wait
for
a
propitious
breeze
philosophy
love
poetry
politics
painting

with
a
discourse
concerning
evolution
painting
again
the

the
mythological
in

music
and
if
we
add
the
epilogue
the
invention
of
printing
these
are
the
successive
themes
of
browning
and
they
are
important
and
interesting
themes
unfortunately
the
method
of
discussion
is
neither
sufficiently
abstract
for
the
lucid
exposition
of
ideas
nor
sufficiently
concrete
for
the
pure
communication
of

the

not
indolent
acquiescence
with
our
intellectual
limitations

constantly
present
does
man
groan
because
he
can
not
comprehend
the

in

it

christopher
smart
who
triumphs
for
once
so
magnificently
in
his
song
to
david
and
fails
with
all
his
contemporaries
in
the
poetry
of
ambitious
instruction
and
why
because
for
once
he
was
content
with
the
first
step
that
poetry
should
take
to
confer
enjoyment
leaving
instruction
the
fruit
of
enjoyment
to
come
later
true
learning
teaches
through
love
and
delight
not
through
pretentious
didactics
a
truth
forgotten
by
the
whole
tribe
of
eighteenth
century
versifiers
and
once
more
does
francis
furini
paint
the
naked
body
in
all
its
beauty
right
let
him
study
precisely
this
divine
thing
the
body
before
he
looks
upward
let
him
retire
from
the
infinite
into
his
proper
circumscription
only
by
looking
low
ere
looking
high
comes
penetration
of
the
mystery
so
also
with
our
view
of
the
mingled
good
and
evil
in
the
world
perhaps
to
some
transcendent
vision
evil
may
wholly
disappear
perhaps
we
shall
ourselves
make
this
discovery
as
we
look
back
upon
the
life
on
earth
meanwhile
it
is
as
men
that
we
must
see
things
and
even
if
evil
be
an
illusion
as
browning
trusts
it
is
a
needful
illusion
in
our
educational
process
since
through
evil
we
become
aware
of
good
thus
at
every
point
browning
accepts
here
as
in
a
limited
provisional
knowledge
as
sufficient
for
our
present
needs
with
a
sustaining
hope
which
extends
into
the
future
on
the
other
hand
if
your
affair
is
not
the
sincerity
of
thought
and
feeling
but
a
design
to
rule
the
mass
of
men
for
your
own
advantage
you
must
act
in
a
different
spirit
do
not
in
the
manner
of
bubb
doddington
attempt
to
impose
upon
your
fellows
with
the
obvious
and
pretence
that
all
you
do
has
been
undertaken
on
their
behalf
and
in
their
interests
there
is
a
newer
and
a
better
trick
than
that
assume
the
supernatural
have
a
mission
have
a
message
be
earnest
with
all
the
authority
of
a
divine
purpose
play
boldly
this
new
card
of
statesmanship
and
you
may
have
from
time
to
time
as
many
inconsistent
missions
and
messages
as
ambitious
statecraft
can
suggest
to
you
through
all
your
gyrations
the
admiring
crowd
will
still
stand
agape
was
browning
irony
of
a
cynical
philosophy
of
statesmanship
suggested
by
his
view
of
the
procedure
of
a
politician
whom
he
had
once
admired
whose
talents
he
still
recognised
but
from
whom
he
now
turned
away
with
indignant
aversion
however
this
may
have
been
his
poems
which
touch
on
politics
do
not
imply
that
respect
for
the
people
thinking
feeling
and
moving
in
masses
which
is
a
common
profession
with
the
liberal
leaders
of
the
platform
liberalism
was
a
form
of
his
individualism
he
like
shakespeare
had
a
sympathy
with
the
wants
and
affections
of
the
humblest
human
lives
and
like
shakespeare
he
thought
that
foolish
or
incompetent
heads
are
often
conjoined
with
hearts
that
in
a
high
degree
deserve
respect
the
last
volume
of
a
long
array
was
published
in
london
on
the
last
day
of
browning
life
as
he
lay
dying
in
venice
telegraphed
tidings
reached
his
son
of
the
eager
demand
for
copies
made
in
anticipation
of
its
appearance
and
of
the
instant
and
appreciative
reviews
browning
heard
the
report
with
a
quiet
gratification
it
is
happy
when
praise
in
departing
is
justified
and
this
was
the
case
with
a
collection
of
poems
which
to
some
readers
seemed
like
a
revival
of
the
poetry
of
its
author
best
years
of
early
and
mid
manhood
is
however
in
the
main
distinctly
an
autumn
gathering
a
handful
of
flowers
and
fruit
belonging
to
the
indian
summer
of
his
genius
the
prologue
is
a
confession
like
that
of
wordsworth
great
ode
that
a
glory
has
passed
away
from
the
earth
when
first
he
set
eyes
on
asolo
some
fifty
years
previously
the
splendour
of
italian
landscape
seemed
that
of
terror
with
beauty
like
the
bush
burning
yet
unconsumed
now
while
the
beauty
remains
the
flame
is
extinct
the
bush
is
bare
browning
finds
his
consolation
in
the
belief
that
he
has
come
nearer
to
the
realities
of
earth
by
discarding
fancies
and
that
his
wonder
and
awe
are
more
wisely
directed
towards
the
transcendent
god
than
towards
his
creatures
but
in
truth
what
the
mind
confers
is
a
fact
and
no
fancy
the
loss
of
what
browning
calls
the
soul
is
the
loss
of
a
substantial
a
divine
possession
the
has
in
it
a
certain
energy
but
the
thews
are
those
of
an
old
athlete
and
through
the
energy
we
are
conscious
of
the
strain
the
speaker
pitches
his
voice
high
as
if
it
could
not
otherwise
be
heard
at
a
distance
the
a
speculation
on
the
time
when
power
will
show
itself
fully
and
therefore
be
known
as
love
has
some
of
that
vigorous
intellectual
garrulity
which
had
grown
on
browning
during
the
years
when
unhappily
for
his
poetry
he
came
to
be
regarded
chiefly
as
a
prophet
and
a
sage
an
old
man
rightly
values
the
truths
which
experience
has
made
real
for
him
he
repeats
them
again
and
again
for
they
constitute
the
best
gift
he
can
offer
to
his
disciples
but
his
utterances
are
not
always
directly
inspired
they
are
sometimes
faintly
echoed
from
an
earlier
inspiration
in
the
while
accepting
our
limitations
of
knowledge
which
he
can
term
ignorance
in
its
contrast
with
the
vast
unknown
browning
discovers
in
the
moral
consciousness
of
man
a
prophecy
of
the
ultimate
triumph
of
good
over
what
we
think
of
as
evil
a
prophecy
of
the
final
reconciliation
of
love
with
power
and
among
the
laws
of
life
is
not
merely
submission
but
aspiration
life
is
to
wake
not
sleep
rise
and
not
rest
but
press
from
earth
level
where
blindly
creep
things
perfected
more
or
less
to
the
heaven
height
far
and
steep
where
amid
what
strifes
and
storms
may
wait
the
adventurous
quest
power
is
love
the
voice
of
the
poet
of
and
of
ben
is
still
audible
in
this
latest
of
his
prophesyings
and
therefore
he
welcomes
earth
in
his
earth
with
its
whole
array
of
failures
and
despairs
as
the
fit
for
man
better
its
trials
and
losses
and
crosses
than
a
sterile
uniformity
of
happiness
better
its
strife
than
rest
in
any
golden
mean
of
excellence
nor
are
its
intellectual
errors
and
illusions
without
their
educational
value
it
is
better
as
with
its
recollections
of
childhood
assures
us
that
the
boy
should
believe
in
troy
siege
and
the
combats
of
hector
and
achilles
as
veritable
facts
of
history
than
bend
his
brow
over
wolfs
prolegomena
or
perplex
his
brain
with
moral
philosophies
to
grapple
with
which
his
mind
is
not
yet
competent
by
and
by
his
illusions
will
disappear
while
their
gains
will
remain
the
general
impression
left
by
is
that
of
intellectual
and
imaginative
vigour
the
series
of
is
very
striking
and
original
in
both
pictorial
and
passionate
power
is
a
poem
of
the
indian
summer
but
it
has
the
beauty
with
a
touch
of
the
pathos
proper
to
the
time
the
love
songs
are
rather
songs
of
praise
than
of
passion
but
they
are
beautiful
songs
of
praise
and
that
entitled
which
is
frankly
a
poem
of
old
age
has
in
it
the
genuine
passion
of
memory
does
in
truth
revive
the
manner
of
earlier
volumes
the
infinite
passion
and
the
pain
of
finite
hearts
that
yearn
told
of
in
a
poem
of
is
present
with
a
touch
of
humour
to
guard
it
from
its
own
excess
in
the
admirable
the
speaker
who
may
not
liberate
his
soul
can
perhaps
identify
a
quotation
and
he
gallantly
accepts
his
humble
r√¥le
in
the
of
foiled
passion
no
the
book
which
noticed
how
the
wave
said
she
was
not
by
ruskin
i
said
vernon
lee
and
in
the
uttered
vernon
lee
lies
a
vast
renunciation
half
comical
and
wholly
tragic
there
are
jests
in
the
volume
and
these
with
the
exception
of
dell
have
the
merit
of
brevity
they
buzz
swiftly
in
and
out
and
do
not
wind
about
us
with
the
terror
of
voluminous
coils
as
sometimes
happens
when
browning
is
in
his
mood
of
mirth
there
are
stories
and
they
are
told
with
spirit
and
with
skill
in
the
does
justice
to
the
honest
jealousy
of
a
wife
and
to
the
honest
love
of
a
husband
who
returns
from
the
wanderings
of
his
imagination
to
the
frank
fidelity
of
his
heart
cynicism
grows
genial
in
the
jest
of
pope
and
the
in
laughter
and
kisses
audible
from
the
page
and
a
woman
art
in
turn
tragedy
in
a
hearty
piece
of
comedy
presents
us
with
the
latest
transformation
of
the
herakles
ideal
where
a
good
christian
herakles
pope
sixtus
of
rome
makes
common
cause
with
his
spiritual
children
in
their
humble
pleasures
of
the
senses
and
in
contrast
with
this
poem
of
the
religion
of
joy
is
the
story
of
another
ruler
of
rome
the
too
fortunate
emperor
augustus
who
in
the
shadow
of
the
religion
of
fear
and
sorrow
must
propitiate
the
envy
of
fate
by
turning
beggar
once
a
year
a
shivering
thrill
runs
through
us
as
we
catch
a
sight
of
the
supreme
mendicant
sparkling
eyes
beneath
their
eyebrows
ridge
he
god
shouts
lucius
varus
rufus
man
and
any
moment
mutters
low
some
power
admonishing
the
there
were
nobler
sides
of
paganism
than
this
with
which
browning
seems
never
to
have
had
an
adequate
sympathy
and
yet
the
religion
even
of
marcus
aurelius
lacked
something
of
the
joy
of
the
religion
of
the
thankful
pope
who
feasted
upon
beans
in
the
winter
which
followed
his
change
of
abode
from
warwick
crescent
to
the
more
commodious
house
in
de
vere
gardens
the
winter
of
browning
health
and
strength
visibly
declined
a
succession
of
exhausting
colds
lowered
his
vitality
yet
he
maintained
his
habitual
ways
of
life
and
would
not
yield
in
august
he
started
ill
for
his
italian
holiday
and
travelled
with
difficulty
and
distress
but
the
rest
among
the
mountains
at
primiero
restored
him
at
venice
he
seemed
as
vigorous
as
he
was
joyous
and
when
he
returned
to
london
in
february
the
improvement
in
his
strength
was
in
a
considerable
measure
maintained
yet
it
was
evident
that
the
physical
vigour
which
had
seemed
invincible
was
on
the
ebb
in
the
early
summer
he
paid
the
last
of
those
visits
which
he
so
highly
valued
to
balliol
college
oxford
the
opening
week
of
june
found
him
at
cambridge
mr
gosse
has
told
how
on
the
first
sunday
of
that
month
browning
and
he
sat
together
in
a
sequestered
part
of
the
beautiful
fellows
garden
of
trinity
under
a
cloudless
sky
amid
the
early
foliage
with
double
hawthorns
in
bloom
and
how
the
old
man
in
a
mood
of
serenity
and
without
his
usual
gesticulation
talked
of
his
own
early
life
and
aspirations
he
shrank
that
summer
says
mrs
orr
from
the
fatigue
of
a
journey
to
italy
and
thought
of
scotland
as
a
place
of
rest
but
unfavourable
weather
in
early
august
forbade
the
execution
of
the
plan
an
invitation
from
mrs
bronson
to
her
house
at
asolo
to
be
followed
by
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
son
and
his
son
wife
in
the
palazzo
rezzonico
venice
were
attractions
not
to
be
resisted
and
in
company
with
miss
browning
he
reached
the
little
that
had
grown
so
dear
to
him
without
mishap
and
even
without
fatigue
to
the
early
days
of
july
shortly
before
his
departure
for
italy
belong
two
incidents
which
may
be
placed
side
by
side
as
exhibiting
two
contrasted
sides
of
browning
character
on
the
of
that
month
he
dined
with
the
shah
who
begged
for
the
gift
of
one
of
his
books
next
day
he
chose
a
volume
the
binding
of
which
might
as
he
says
take
the
imperial
eye
but
the
pleasure
of
the
day
was
another
gift
a
gift
to
a
person
who
was
not
imperial
i
said
to
myself
he
wrote
to
his
young
friend
the
painter
lehmann
daughter
addressed
in
the
letter
as
my
beloved
alma
i
said
to
myself
do
i
present
my
poetry
to
a
personage
for
whom
i
do
not
care
three
straws
why
should
i
not
venture
to
do
as
much
for
a
young
lady
i
love
dearly
who
for
the
sake
will
not
impossibly
care
rather
for
the
inside
than
the
outside
of
the
volume
so
i
was
bold
enough
to
take
one
and
offer
it
for
your
kind
acceptance
begging
you
to
remember
in
days
to
come
that
the
author
whether
a
good
poet
or
not
was
always
my
alma
your
affectionate
friend
robert
browning
a
gracious
bowing
of
old
age
over
the
grace
and
charm
of
youth
but
the
work
of
two
days
later
july
was
not
gracious
the
lines
to
edward
fitzgerald
printed
in
were
dated
on
that
day
it
is
stated
by
mrs
orr
that
when
they
were
despatched
to
the
journal
in
which
they
appeared
browning
regretted
the
deed
though
afterwards
he
found
reasons
to
justify
himself
fitzgerald
reference
to
mrs
browning
caused
him
a
spasm
of
pain
and
indignation
nor
did
the
pain
for
long
subside
the
expression
of
his
indignation
was
outrageous
in
manner
and
deficient
in
real
power
he
had
read
a
worse
meaning
into
the
unhappy
words
than
had
been
intended
and
the
writer
was
dead
browning
act
was
like
an
involuntary
muscular
contraction
which
he
could
not
control
the
lines
sprang
far
more
from
love
than
from
hate
i
felt
as
if
she
had
died
yesterday
he
said
we
can
not
regret
that
browning
was
capable
of
such
an
offence
we
can
only
regret
that
what
should
have
controlled
his
cry
of
pain
and
rage
did
not
operate
at
the
right
moment
in
asolo
beside
the
gate
mrs
bronson
had
found
and
partly
made
what
mr
henry
james
describes
as
one
of
the
quaintest
possible
little
places
of
la
mura
the
house
resting
half
upon
the
dismantled
dissimulated
no
sweeter
spot
in
all
the
sweetnesses
of
italy
browning
last
visit
to
asolo
was
a
time
of
almost
unmingled
enjoyment
he
seemed
possessed
writes
mrs
orr
by
a
strange
buoyancy
an
almost
feverish
joy
in
life
the
thought
that
he
was
in
asolo
again
which
he
had
first
seen
in
his
year
and
since
then
had
never
ceased
to
remember
with
affection
was
a
happy
wonder
to
him
he
would
stand
delighted
on
the
loggia
of
la
mura
looking
out
over
the
plain
and
identifying
the
places
of
historical
interest
some
of
which
were
connected
with
his
own
sordello
nor
was
the
later
story
forgotten
of
queen
caterina
cornaro
whose
overlooks
asolo
and
whose
secretary
cardinal
bembo
wrote
from
which
came
the
suggestion
for
the
title
of
forthcoming
volume
at
times
as
mrs
bronson
relates
the
beauty
of
the
prospect
was
enough
with
no
historical
reminiscences
the
plain
with
its
moving
shadows
the
to
the
west
and
southwards
the
delicate
outline
of
the
euganean
hills
i
was
right
said
he
to
fall
in
love
with
this
place
fifty
years
ago
was
i
not
the
procedure
of
the
day
at
asolo
was
almost
as
regular
as
that
of
a
london
day
the
morning
walk
with
his
sister
when
everything
that
was
notable
was
noted
by
his
keen
eyes
the
return
english
newspapers
correspondence
the
light
meal
the
afternoon
drive
in
mrs
branson
carriage
tea
upon
the
loggia
the
evening
with
music
or
reading
or
visits
to
the
little
theatre
these
constituted
an
almost
unvarying
and
happy
routine
on
his
walks
he
delighted
to
recognise
little
details
of
architecture
which
he
had
observed
in
former
years
or
he
would
peer
into
the
hedgerows
and
watch
the
living
creatures
that
lurked
there
or
would
whistle
softly
to
the
lizards
basking
on
the
low
walls
which
border
the
roads
to
try
his
old
power
of
attracting
them
sometimes
a
longer
drive
and
that
to
bassano
was
his
favourite
required
an
earlier
start
in
the
carriage
with
luncheon
at
some
little
inn
if
we
were
ever
late
in
returning
to
asolo
mrs
bronson
writes
he
would
say
vittorio
to
drive
quickly
we
must
not
lose
the
sunset
from
the
loggia
often
after
a
storm
the
effects
of
sun
breaking
through
clouds
before
its
setting
combined
with
the
scenery
of
plain
and
mountain
were
such
as
to
rouse
the
poet
to
the
greatest
enthusiasm
heedless
of
cold
or
damp
forgetting
himself
completely
though
warmly
wrapped
to
please
others
he
would
gaze
on
the
changing
aspects
of
earth
and
sky
until
darkness
covered
everything
from
his
sight
when
in
the
evenings
browning
read
aloud
he
did
not
like
tennyson
as
described
by
mr
rossetti
allow
his
voice
to
sway
onward
with
a
chaunt
which
gave
noble
value
and
emphasis
to
the
metrical
structure
and
pauses
his
delivery
was
full
and
distinctive
but
it
took
much
less
account
than
tennyson
of
the
poem
as
a
rhythmical
whole
his
delivery
had
more
affinity
to
that
of
an
actor
laying
stress
on
all
the
light
and
shade
of
the
composition
its
touches
of
character
the
conversational
points
its
dramatic
in
those
qualities
of
elocution
in
which
tennyson
was
strong
and
aimed
to
be
strong
browning
was
contentedly
weak
and
sometimes
like
another
great
poet
pope
he
was
deeply
affected
by
the
passion
of
beauty
or
heroism
or
pathos
in
what
he
read
and
could
not
control
his
feelings
mrs
orr
mentions
that
in
reading
aloud
his
translation
of
the
he
like
pope
in
reading
a
passage
of
his
was
moved
to
tears
dr
furnivall
tells
of
the
mounting
excitement
with
which
he
once
delivered
in
the
writer
hearing
his
when
at
la
mura
after
his
dreamy
playing
on
a
spinet
of
old
airs
melodious
melancholy
airs
browning
would
propose
to
read
aloud
it
was
not
his
own
poetry
that
he
most
willingly
chose
no
he
would
say
then
with
a
smile
us
have
some
real
poetry
and
the
volume
would
be
one
by
shelley
or
keats
or
coleridge
or
tennyson
it
was
as
a
punishment
to
his
hostess
for
the
crime
of
having
no
shakespeare
on
her
shelves
that
he
threatened
her
with
one
of
his
toughest
poems
but
the
tough
poem
interpreted
by
his
emphasis
and
pauses
became
as
clear
and
comprehensible
as
one
could
possibly
desire
in
his
talk
at
asolo
he
seemed
purposely
to
avoid
deep
and
serious
topics
if
such
were
broached
in
his
presence
he
dismissed
them
with
one
strong
convincing
sentence
and
adroitly
turned
the
current
of
conversation
into
a
shallower
channel
a
project
which
came
very
near
his
heart
was
that
of
purchasing
from
the
municipal
authorities
a
small
piece
of
ground
divided
from
la
mura
by
a
ravine
clothed
with
olive
and
other
trees
on
which
stood
an
unfinished
building
the
words
are
mrs
bronson
commanding
the
finest
view
in
asolo
he
desired
much
to
have
a
summer
or
autumn
abode
to
which
he
might
turn
with
the
assurance
of
rest
in
what
most
pleased
and
suited
him
in
imagination
with
his
characteristic
eagerness
he
had
already
altered
and
added
to
the
existing
structure
and
decided
on
the
size
and
aspect
of
the
loggia
which
was
to
that
of
la
mura
shall
have
a
tower
he
said
i
can
see
venice
at
every
hour
of
the
day
and
i
shall
call
it
pippa
tower
we
will
throw
a
rustic
bridge
across
the
streamlet
in
the
ravine
and
then
in
a
graver
mood
it
may
not
be
for
me
to
enjoy
it
long
who
can
say
but
it
will
be
useful
for
pen
and
his
family
but
i
am
good
for
ten
years
yet
and
when
his
son
visited
asolo
and
approved
of
the
project
of
pippa
tower
browning
happiness
in
his
dream
was
complete
it
was
on
the
night
of
his
death
that
the
authorities
of
asolo
decided
that
the
purchase
might
be
carried
into
effect
illustration
the
palazzo
rezzonico
venice
a
drawing
miss
katherine
kimball
for
a
time
during
this
last
visit
to
asolo
browning
suffered
some
inconvenience
from
shortness
of
breath
in
climbing
hills
but
the
discomfort
passed
away
he
looked
forward
to
an
early
return
to
england
spoke
with
pleasant
anticipation
of
the
piano
which
his
kind
friend
mrs
bronson
desired
to
procure
at
boston
and
place
in
his
study
in
de
vere
gardens
and
he
dreamed
of
future
poetical
achievements
shall
i
whisper
to
you
my
ambition
and
my
hope
he
asked
his
hostess
it
is
to
write
a
tragedy
better
than
anything
i
have
done
yet
i
think
of
it
constantly
with
the
end
of
october
the
happy
days
at
asolo
were
at
an
end
on
the
first
of
november
he
was
in
venice
magnificently
lodged
he
says
in
this
vast
palazzo
which
my
son
has
really
shown
himself
fit
to
possess
so
surprising
are
his
restorations
and
improvements
at
asolo
he
had
parted
from
his
american
friend
story
with
the
words
more
than
forty
years
of
friendship
and
never
a
break
in
venice
he
met
an
american
friend
of
more
recent
years
professor
corson
who
describes
him
as
stepping
briskly
with
a
look
that
went
everywhere
and
as
cheerfully
anticipating
many
more
years
of
productive
work
yet
in
truth
the
end
was
near
dining
with
mr
and
mrs
curtis
where
he
read
aloud
some
poems
of
his
forthcoming
volume
he
met
a
london
physician
dr
bird
next
evening
dr
bird
again
dined
with
browning
who
expressed
confident
satisfaction
as
to
his
state
of
health
and
held
out
his
wrist
that
his
words
might
be
confirmed
by
the
regularity
and
vigour
of
his
pulse
the
physician
became
at
once
aware
that
browning
confidence
was
far
from
receiving
the
warrant
in
which
he
believed
still
he
maintained
his
customary
two
hours
walk
each
day
towards
the
close
of
november
on
a
day
of
fog
he
returned
from
the
lido
with
symptoms
of
a
bronchial
cold
he
dealt
with
the
trouble
as
he
was
accustomed
and
did
not
take
to
his
bed
though
feeling
scarcely
fit
to
travel
he
planned
his
departure
for
england
after
the
lapse
of
four
or
five
days
on
december
an
italian
physician
was
summoned
and
immediately
perceived
the
gravity
of
the
case
within
a
few
days
the
bronchial
trouble
was
subdued
but
failure
of
the
heart
was
apparent
some
hours
before
the
end
he
said
to
one
of
his
nurses
i
feel
much
worse
i
know
now
that
i
must
die
the
ebbing
away
of
life
was
painless
as
the
clocks
of
venice
were
striking
ten
on
the
night
of
thursday
december
browning
died
he
had
never
concerned
himself
much
about
his
place
of
burial
a
lifeless
body
seemed
to
him
only
an
old
vesture
that
had
been
cast
aside
he
had
said
to
his
sister
in
the
foregoing
summer
mrs
orr
tells
us
that
he
wished
to
be
buried
wherever
he
might
die
if
in
england
with
his
mother
if
in
france
with
his
father
if
in
italy
with
his
wife
the
english
cemetery
in
florence
had
however
been
closed
the
choice
seemed
to
lie
between
venice
which
was
the
desire
of
the
city
or
if
the
difficulties
could
be
overcome
by
the
intervention
of
lord
dufferin
the
old
florentine
cemetery
the
matter
was
decided
otherwise
a
grave
in
westminster
abbey
was
proposed
by
dean
bradley
and
the
proposal
was
accepted
a
private
service
took
place
in
the
the
coffin
in
compliance
with
the
civic
requirements
was
conveyed
with
public
honours
to
the
chapel
on
the
island
of
san
michele
and
from
thence
to
the
house
in
de
vere
gardens
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
in
presence
of
a
great
and
reverent
crowd
with
solemn
music
arranged
for
the
words
of
mrs
browning
poem
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
the
body
of
browning
was
laid
in
its
in
poets
corner
to
attempt
at
the
present
time
to
determine
the
place
of
browning
in
the
history
of
english
poetry
is
perhaps
premature
yet
the
record
of
how
it
strikes
a
contemporary
may
itself
have
a
certain
historical
interest
when
estimates
of
this
kind
have
been
revised
by
time
even
their
errors
are
sometimes
instructive
or
if
not
instructive
are
amusing
it
is
probable
that
tennyson
will
remain
as
the
chief
representative
in
poetry
of
the
victorian
period
browning
who
was
slower
in
securing
an
audience
may
be
found
to
possess
a
more
independent
individuality
yet
in
truth
no
great
writer
is
independent
of
the
influences
of
his
age
browning
as
a
poet
had
his
origins
in
the
romantic
school
of
english
poetry
but
he
came
at
a
time
when
the
romance
of
external
action
and
adventure
had
exhausted
itself
and
when
it
became
necessary
to
carry
romance
into
the
inner
world
where
the
adventures
are
those
of
the
soul
on
the
ethical
and
religious
side
he
sprang
from
english
puritanism
each
of
these
influences
was
modified
by
his
own
genius
and
by
the
circumstances
of
its
development
his
keen
observation
of
facts
and
passionate
inquisition
of
human
character
drew
him
in
the
direction
of
what
is
termed
realism
this
combination
of
realism
with
romance
is
even
more
strikingly
seen
in
an
elder
contemporary
on
whose
work
browning
bestowed
an
ardent
admiration
the
novelist
balzac
his
puritanism
received
important
modifications
from
his
artistic
instincts
and
sympathies
and
again
from
the
liberality
of
a
intellect
he
has
the
strenuous
moral
force
of
puritanism
but
he
is
wholly
free
from
asceticism
except
in
the
higher
significance
of
that
word
the
hardy
discipline
of
an
athlete
opinions
count
for
less
than
the
form
and
the
habitual
attitudes
of
a
soul
these
with
browning
were
always
essentially
christian
he
regarded
our
life
on
earth
as
a
state
of
probation
and
of
preparation
sometimes
as
a
in
which
our
test
lies
in
the
choice
of
the
worse
or
the
better
side
and
the
energy
of
devotion
to
the
cause
sometimes
as
a
school
of
education
in
the
processes
of
which
the
emotions
play
a
larger
part
than
the
intellect
the
degrees
in
that
school
are
not
to
be
taken
on
earth
and
on
the
the
final
issue
is
not
to
be
determined
here
so
that
what
appears
as
defeat
may
contain
within
it
an
assured
promise
of
ultimate
victory
the
attitudes
of
the
spirit
which
were
most
habitual
with
him
were
two
the
attitude
of
aspiration
and
the
attitude
of
submission
these
he
brought
into
harmony
with
each
other
by
his
conception
of
human
life
as
a
period
of
training
for
a
higher
life
we
must
make
the
most
vigorous
and
joyous
use
of
our
schooling
and
yet
we
must
press
towards
what
lies
beyond
it
from
the
romantic
poetry
of
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
comes
a
cry
or
a
sigh
of
limitless
desire
under
the
inspiration
of
the
revolutionary
movement
passion
had
broken
the
bounds
of
the
eighteenth
century
ideal
of
balance
and
moderation
with
the
transcendental
reaction
against
a
mechanical
view
of
the
relation
of
god
to
the
universe
and
to
humanity
the
soul
had
put
forth
boundless
claims
and
unmeasured
aspirations
in
his
poetic
method
each
writer
followed
the
leadings
of
his
own
genius
without
reference
to
common
rules
and
standards
the
individualism
of
the
revolutionary
epoch
asserted
itself
to
the
full
these
several
influences
helped
to
determine
the
character
of
browning
poetry
but
meeting
in
him
the
ethical
and
religious
tendencies
of
english
puritanism
they
acquired
new
significances
and
assumed
new
forms
the
cry
of
desire
could
not
turn
as
it
did
with
byron
to
cynicism
it
must
not
waste
itself
as
sometimes
happened
with
shelley
in
the
air
or
the
ether
it
must
be
controlled
by
the
will
and
turned
to
some
spiritual
uses
the
transcendental
feeling
which
wordsworth
most
often
attained
through
an
impassioned
contemplation
of
external
nature
must
rest
upon
a
broader
basis
and
include
among
its
sources
or
abettors
all
the
higher
passions
of
humanity
the
revolutionary
individualism
must
be
maintained
and
extended
in
his
methods
browning
would
acknowledge
no
master
he
would
please
himself
and
compel
his
readers
to
accept
his
method
even
if
strange
or
singular
as
for
the
mediaeval
revival
which
tried
to
turn
aside
and
in
part
capture
the
transcendental
tendencies
of
his
time
browning
rejected
it
in
the
old
temper
of
english
puritanism
on
the
side
of
religion
but
on
the
side
of
art
it
opened
certain
avenues
upon
which
he
eagerly
entered
the
scientific
movement
of
the
nineteenth
century
influenced
him
partly
as
a
force
to
be
met
and
opposed
by
his
militant
transcendentalism
yet
he
gives
definite
expression
in
to
an
idea
of
evolution
both
in
nature
and
in
human
society
an
idea
of
evolution
which
is
however
essentially
theistic
all
that
seems
proved
in
darwin
scheme
he
wrote
to
dr
furnivall
in
was
a
conception
familiar
to
me
from
the
beginning
the
positive
influences
of
the
scientific
age
in
which
he
lived
upon
browning
work
were
chiefly
these
first
it
tended
to
intellectualise
his
instincts
compelling
him
to
justify
them
by
a
definite
theory
and
secondly
it
with
his
tendency
towards
realism
as
a
student
of
the
facts
of
human
nature
it
urged
him
towards
research
in
his
psychology
of
the
passions
it
supported
him
in
his
curious
inquisition
of
the
phenomena
of
the
world
of
mind
being
a
complete
and
a
sane
human
creature
browning
could
not
rest
content
with
the
vicious
asceticism
of
the
intellect
which
calls
itself
scientific
because
it
refuses
to
recognise
any
facts
that
are
not
material
and
tangible
science
itself
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
exists
and
progresses
by
ventures
of
imaginative
faith
and
in
all
matters
which
involve
good
and
evil
hopes
and
fears
in
all
matters
which
determine
the
conduct
of
life
no
rational
person
excludes
from
his
view
the
postulates
of
our
moral
nature
or
should
exclude
the
final
option
of
the
will
the
person
whose
beliefs
are
determined
by
material
facts
alone
and
by
the
understanding
unallied
with
our
other
powers
is
the
irrational
and
unscientific
person
being
a
complete
and
sane
human
creature
browning
was
assured
that
the
visible
order
of
things
is
part
of
a
larger
order
the
existence
of
which
alone
makes
human
life
intelligible
to
the
reason
the
understanding
being
incapable
of
arriving
unaided
at
a
decision
between
rival
theories
of
life
and
neutrality
between
these
being
irrational
and
illegitimate
he
rightly
determined
the
balance
with
the
weight
of
emotion
and
rightly
acted
upon
that
decision
with
all
the
energy
of
his
will
his
chief
intellectual
error
was
not
that
he
undervalued
the
results
of
the
intellect
but
that
he
imagined
the
existence
as
a
part
of
sane
human
nature
of
a
wholly
irrational
intellect
which
in
affairs
of
religious
belief
and
conduct
is
indifferent
to
the
promptings
of
the
emotions
and
the
moral
nature
browning
optimism
has
been
erroneously
ascribed
to
his
temperament
he
declared
that
in
his
personal
experience
the
pain
of
life
outweighed
its
pleasure
he
remembered
former
pain
more
vividly
than
he
remembered
pleasure
his
optimism
was
part
of
the
vigorous
sanity
of
his
moral
nature
like
a
reasonable
man
he
made
the
happiness
which
he
did
not
find
if
any
person
should
censure
the
process
of
giving
objective
validity
to
a
moral
postulate
he
has
only
to
imagine
some
intelligence
making
a
study
of
human
nature
to
such
an
intelligence
our
moral
postulates
would
be
objective
facts
and
have
the
value
of
objective
evidence
that
whole
of
which
our
life
on
earth
forms
a
part
could
not
be
conceived
by
browning
as
rational
without
also
being
conceived
as
good
all
the
parts
of
browning
nature
were
vigorous
and
they
worked
harmoniously
together
his
senses
were
keen
and
alert
his
understanding
was
both
penetrating
and
comprehensive
his
passions
had
sudden
explosive
force
and
also
steadfastness
and
persistency
his
will
supported
his
other
powers
and
perhaps
it
had
too
large
a
share
in
his
later
creative
work
his
feeling
for
external
nature
was
twofold
he
enjoyed
colour
and
form
but
especially
colour
as
a
feast
for
the
eye
and
returned
thanks
for
his
meal
as
the
pope
of
his
poem
did
for
the
this
was
far
removed
from
that
passionate
spiritual
contemplation
of
nature
of
the
wordsworthian
mood
but
now
and
again
for
browning
external
nature
was
not
indeed
suffused
as
for
wordsworth
but
pierced
and
shot
through
with
spiritual
fire
his
chief
interest
however
was
in
man
the
study
of
passions
in
their
directness
and
of
the
intellect
in
its
tortuous
ways
were
at
various
times
almost
equally
attractive
to
him
the
emotions
which
he
chiefly
cared
to
interpret
were
those
connected
with
religion
with
art
and
with
the
relations
of
the
sexes
in
his
presentation
of
character
browning
was
far
from
exhibiting
either
the
universality
or
the
disinterestedness
of
shakespeare
his
sympathy
with
action
was
defective
the
affections
arising
from
hereditary
or
traditional
relations
are
but
slenderly
represented
in
his
poetry
the
passions
which
elect
their
own
objects
are
largely
represented
those
graceful
gaieties
arising
from
a
form
of
society
which
constitute
so
large
a
part
of
shakespeare
comedies
are
almost
wholly
absent
from
his
work
his
humour
was
robust
but
seldom
fine
or
delicate
in
an
age
of
intellectual
and
spiritual
conflict
and
trouble
his
art
was
often
deflected
from
the
highest
ends
by
his
concern
on
behalf
of
ideas
he
could
not
rest
satisfied
it
has
been
observed
with
contemplating
the
children
of
his
imagination
nor
find
the
fulfilment
of
his
aim
in
the
fact
of
having
given
them
existence
it
seems
often
as
if
his
purpose
in
creating
them
was
to
make
them
serve
as
questioners
objectors
and
answerers
in
the
great
debate
of
conflicting
thoughts
which
proceeds
throughout
his
poems
his
object
in
transferring
his
own
consciousness
into
the
consciousness
of
some
imagined
personage
seems
often
to
be
that
of
gaining
a
new
from
which
to
see
another
and
a
different
aspect
of
the
questions
concerning
which
he
could
not
wholly
satisfy
himself
from
any
single
point
of
view
he
can
not
be
content
to
leave
his
men
and
women
in
disinterested
manner
to
look
in
various
directions
according
to
whatever
chanced
to
suit
best
the
temper
and
disposition
he
had
imagined
for
them
they
are
placed
by
him
with
their
eyes
turned
in
very
much
the
same
direction
gazing
towards
the
same
problems
the
same
ideas
and
somehow
browning
himself
seems
to
be
in
company
with
them
all
the
time
learning
their
different
reports
of
the
various
aspects
which
those
problems
or
ideas
present
to
each
of
them
and
choosing
between
the
different
reports
in
order
to
give
credence
to
that
which
seems
true
the
study
of
no
individual
character
would
seem
to
him
of
capital
value
unless
that
character
contained
something
which
should
help
to
throw
light
upon
matters
common
to
all
humanity
upon
the
inquiries
either
as
to
what
it
is
or
as
to
what
are
its
relations
to
the
things
outside
humanity
this
is
not
quite
the
highest
form
of
dramatic
poetry
there
is
in
it
perhaps
something
of
the
error
of
seeking
too
quick
returns
of
profit
and
of
drawing
a
circle
premature
to
use
browning
own
words
heedless
of
far
gain
the
contents
of
characters
so
conceived
can
be
exhausted
whereas
when
characters
are
presented
with
entire
disinterestedness
they
may
seem
to
yield
us
less
at
first
but
they
are
inexhaustible
the
fault
if
it
be
one
lay
partly
in
browning
epoch
partly
in
the
nature
of
his
genius
such
a
method
of
deflected
dramatic
characterisation
as
his
is
less
appropriate
to
regular
drama
than
to
the
monologue
and
accordingly
the
monologue
reflective
or
lyrical
became
the
most
characteristic
instrument
of
his
art
there
is
little
of
repose
in
browning
poetry
he
feared
lethargy
of
heart
the
supine
mood
more
than
he
feared
excess
of
passion
once
or
twice
he
utters
a
sigh
for
rest
but
it
is
for
rest
after
strife
or
labour
broad
spaces
of
repose
of
emotional
tranquillity
are
rare
if
not
entirely
wanting
in
his
poetry
it
is
not
a
high
but
a
range
or
range
upon
range
of
sierras
in
single
poems
there
is
often
a
point
or
moment
in
which
passion
suddenly
reaches
its
culmination
he
flashes
light
upon
the
retina
he
does
not
spread
truth
abroad
like
a
mantle
but
plunges
it
downwards
through
the
mists
of
earth
like
a
searching
and
therefore
he
does
not
always
distribute
the
poetic
value
of
what
he
writes
equally
one
vivid
moment
justifies
all
that
is
preparatory
to
that
great
moment
his
utterance
which
is
always
vigorous
becomes
intensely
luminous
at
the
needful
points
and
then
relapses
to
its
vigour
a
vigour
not
always
accompanied
by
the
highest
poetical
qualities
the
music
of
his
verse
is
entirely
original
and
so
various
are
its
kinds
so
complex
often
are
its
effects
that
it
can
not
be
briefly
characterised
its
attack
upon
the
ear
is
often
by
surprises
which
corresponding
to
the
sudden
turns
of
thought
and
leaps
of
feeling
justify
themselves
as
right
and
delightful
yet
he
sometimes
embarrasses
his
verse
with
an
excess
of
suspensions
and
resolutions
browning
made
many
metrical
experiments
some
of
which
were
unfortunate
but
his
failures
are
rather
to
be
ascribed
to
temporary
lapses
into
a
misdirected
ingenuity
than
to
the
absence
of
metrical
feeling
his
chief
influence
other
than
what
is
purely
artistic
upon
a
reader
is
towards
establishing
a
connection
between
the
known
order
of
things
in
which
we
live
and
move
and
that
larger
order
of
which
it
is
a
part
he
plays
upon
the
will
summoning
it
from
lethargy
to
activity
he
spiritualises
the
passions
by
showing
that
they
tend
through
what
is
human
towards
what
is
divine
he
assigns
to
the
intellect
a
sufficient
field
for
exercise
but
attaches
more
value
to
its
efforts
than
to
its
attainments
his
faith
in
an
unseen
order
of
things
creates
a
hope
which
persists
through
the
apparent
failures
of
earth
in
a
true
sense
he
may
be
named
the
successor
of
wordsworth
not
indeed
as
an
artist
but
as
a
teacher
substantially
the
creed
maintained
by
each
was
the
same
creed
and
they
were
both
more
emphatic
proclaimers
of
it
than
any
other
contemporary
poets
but
their
ways
of
holding
and
of
maintaining
that
creed
were
far
apart
wordsworth
enunciated
his
doctrines
as
if
he
had
never
met
with
and
never
expected
to
meet
with
any
gainsaying
of
them
he
discoursed
as
a
philosopher
might
to
a
school
of
disciples
gathered
together
to
be
taught
by
his
wisdom
not
to
dispute
it
he
feared
chiefly
not
a
counter
creed
but
the
materialising
effects
of
the
industrial
movement
of
his
own
day
expecting
no
contradiction
wordsworth
did
not
care
to
quit
his
own
standpoint
in
order
that
he
might
see
how
things
appear
from
the
opposing
side
he
did
not
argue
but
let
his
utterance
fall
into
a
half
soliloquy
spoken
in
presence
of
an
audience
but
not
always
directly
addressed
to
them
browning
manner
of
speech
was
very
unlike
this
he
seems
to
address
it
often
to
unsympathetic
hearers
of
whose
presence
and
gainsaying
attitude
he
could
not
lose
sight
the
beliefs
for
which
he
pleaded
were
not
in
his
day
as
they
had
been
in
wordsworth
part
of
a
progressive
wave
of
thought
he
occupied
the
disadvantageous
position
of
a
conservative
thinker
the
later
poet
of
spiritual
beliefs
had
to
make
his
way
not
with
but
against
a
great
incoming
tide
of
contemporary
speculation
probably
on
this
account
browning
influence
as
a
teacher
will
extend
over
a
far
shorter
space
of
time
than
that
of
wordsworth
for
wordsworth
is
and
is
complete
without
reference
to
the
ideas
which
oppose
his
own
his
work
suffices
for
its
own
explanation
and
will
always
commend
itself
to
certain
readers
either
as
the
system
of
a
philosophic
thinker
or
as
the
dream
of
a
poet
browning
thought
where
it
is
most
significant
is
often
more
or
less
enigmatical
if
taken
by
itself
its
energetic
gestures
unless
we
see
what
they
are
directed
against
seem
aimless
beating
the
air
his
thought
as
far
as
it
is
polemical
will
probably
cease
to
interest
future
readers
new
methods
of
attack
will
call
forth
new
methods
of
defence
time
will
make
its
discreet
selection
from
his
writings
and
the
portion
which
seems
most
likely
to
survive
is
that
which
presents
in
true
forms
of
art
the
permanent
passions
of
humanity
and
characters
of
enduring
interest
