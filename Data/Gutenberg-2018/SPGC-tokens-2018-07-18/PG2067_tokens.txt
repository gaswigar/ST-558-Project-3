explanatory
note
when
one
of
the
leading
publicists
in
america
albert
shaw
of
the
review
of
reviews
after
reading
the
manuscript
of
part
i
of
this
volume
characterized
the
author
as
the
robinson
crusoe
of
the
twentieth
century
he
touched
the
feature
of
the
narrative
which
is
at
once
most
attractive
and
most
dangerous
for
the
succession
of
trying
and
thrilling
experiences
recorded
seems
in
places
too
highly
colored
to
be
real
or
sometimes
even
possible
in
this
day
and
generation
i
desire
therefore
to
assure
the
reader
at
the
outset
that
ossendowski
is
a
man
of
long
and
diverse
experience
as
a
scientist
and
writer
with
a
training
for
careful
observation
which
should
put
the
stamp
of
accuracy
and
reliability
on
his
chronicle
only
the
extraordinary
events
of
these
extraordinary
times
could
have
thrown
one
with
so
many
talents
back
into
the
surroundings
of
the
cave
man
and
thus
given
to
us
this
unusual
account
of
personal
adventure
of
great
human
mysteries
and
of
the
political
and
religious
motives
which
are
energizing
the
heart
of
my
share
in
the
work
has
been
to
induce
ossendowski
to
write
his
story
at
this
time
and
to
assist
him
in
rendering
his
experiences

chapter

into
the
forests
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
i
happened
to
be
living
in
the
siberian
town
of
krasnoyarsk
situated
on
the
shores
of
the
river
yenisei
that
noble
stream
which
is
cradled
in
the
mountains
of
mongolia
to
pour
its
warming
life
into
the
arctic
ocean
and
to
whose
mouth
nansen
has
twice
come
to
open
the
shortest
road
for
commerce
from
europe
to
the
heart
of
asia
there
in
the
depths
of
the
still
siberian
winter
i
was
suddenly
caught
up
in
the
whirling
storm
of
mad
revolution
raging
all
over
russia
sowing
in
this
peaceful
and
rich
land
vengeance
hate
bloodshed
and
crimes
that
go
unpunished
by
the
law
no
one
could
tell
the
hour
of
his
fate
the
people
lived
from
day
to
day
and
left
their
homes
not
knowing
whether
they
should
return
to
them
or
whether
they
should
be
dragged
from
the
streets
and
thrown
into
the
dungeons
of
that
travesty
of
courts
the
revolutionary
committee
more
terrible
and
more
bloody
than
those
of
the
mediaeval
inquisition
we
who
were
strangers
in
this
distraught
land
were
not
saved
from
its
persecutions
and
i
personally
lived
through
them
one
morning
when
i
had
gone
out
to
see
a
friend
i
suddenly
received
the
news
that
twenty
red
soldiers
had
surrounded
my
house
to
arrest
me
and
that
i
must
escape
i
quickly
put
on
one
of
my
friend
s
old
hunting
suits
took
some
money
and
hurried
away
on
foot
along
the
back
ways
of
the
town
till
i
struck
the
open
road
where
i
engaged
a
peasant
who
in
four
hours
had
driven
me
twenty
miles
from
the
town
and
set
me
down
in
the
midst
of
a
deeply
forested
region
on
the
way
i
bought
a
rifle
three
hundred
cartridges
an
ax
a
knife
a
sheepskin
overcoat
tea
salt
dry
bread
and
a
kettle
i
penetrated
into
the
heart
of
the
wood
to
an
abandoned
hut
from
this
day
i
became
a
genuine
trapper
but
i
never
dreamed
that
i
should
follow
this
role
as
long
as
i
did
the
next
morning
i
went
hunting
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
kill
two
heathcock
i
found
deer
tracks
in
plenty
and
felt
sure
that
i
should
not
want
for
food
however
my
sojourn
in
this
place
was
not
for
long
five
days
later
when
i
returned
from
hunting
i
noticed
smoke
curling
up
out
of
the
chimney
of
my
hut
i
stealthily
crept
along
closer
to
the
cabin
and
discovered
two
saddled
horses
with
soldiers
rifles
slung
to
the
saddles
two
disarmed
men
were
not
dangerous
for
me
with
a
weapon
so
i
quickly
rushed
across
the
open
and
entered
the
hut
from
the
bench
two
soldiers
started
up
in
fright
they
were
bolsheviki
on
their
big
astrakhan
caps
i
made
out
the
red
stars
of
bolshevism
and
on
their
blouses
the
dirty
red
bands
we
greeted
each
other
and
sat
down
the
soldiers
had
already
prepared
tea
and
so
we
drank
this
ever
welcome
hot
beverage
and
chatted
suspiciously
eyeing
one
another
the
while
to
disarm
this
suspicion
on
their
part
i
told
them
that
i
was
a
hunter
from
a
distant
place
and
was
living
there
because
i
found
it
good
country
for
sables
they
announced
to
me
that
they
were
soldiers
of
a
detachment
sent
from
a
town
into
the
woods
to
pursue
all
suspicious
people
do
you
understand
comrade
said
one
of
them
to
me
we
are
looking
for
to
shoot
them
i
knew
it
without
his
explanations
all
my
forces
were
directed
to
assuring
them
by
my
conduct
that
i
was
a
simple
peasant
hunter
and
that
i
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
i
was
thinking
also
all
the
time
of
where
i
should
go
after
the
departure
of
my
unwelcome
guests
it
grew
dark
in
the
darkness
their
faces
were
even
less
attractive
they
took
out
bottles
of
vodka
and
drank
and
the
alcohol
began
to
act
very
noticeably
they
talked
loudly
and
constantly
interrupted
each
other
boasting
how
many
bourgeoisie
they
had
killed
in
krasnoyarsk
and
how
many
cossacks
they
had
slid
under
the
ice
in
the
river
afterwards
they
began
to
quarrel
but
soon
they
were
tired
and
prepared
to
sleep
all
of
a
sudden
and
without
any
warning
the
door
of
the
hut
swung
wide
open
and
the
steam
of
the
heated
room
rolled
out
in
a
great
cloud
out
of
which
seemed
to
rise
like
a
genie
as
the
steam
settled
the
figure
of
a
tall
gaunt
peasant
impressively
crowned
with
the
high
astrakhan
cap
and
wrapped
in
the
great
sheepskin
overcoat
that
added
to
the
massiveness
of
his
figure
he
stood
with
his
rifle
ready
to
fire
under
his
girdle
lay
the
sharp
ax
without
which
the
siberian
peasant
can
not
exist
eyes
quick
and
glimmering
like
those
of
a
wild
beast
fixed
themselves
alternately
on
each
of
us
in
a
moment
he
took
off
his
cap
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
breast
and
asked
of
us
who
is
the
master
here
i
answered
him
may
i
stop
the
night
yes
i
replied
places
enough
for
all
take
a
cup
of
tea
it
is
still
the
stranger
running
his
eyes
constantly
over
all
of
us
and
over
everything
about
the
room
began
to
take
off
his
skin
coat
after
putting
his
rifle
in
the
corner
he
was
dressed
in
an
old
leather
blouse
with
trousers
of
the
same
material
tucked
in
high
felt
boots
his
face
was
quite
young
fine
and
tinged
with
something
akin
to
mockery
his
white
sharp
teeth
glimmered
as
his
eyes
penetrated
everything
they
rested
upon
i
noticed
the
locks
of
grey
in
his
shaggy
head
lines
of
bitterness
circled
his
mouth
they
showed
his
life
had
been
very
stormy
and
full
of
danger
he
took
a
seat
beside
his
rifle
and
laid
his
ax
on
the
floor
below
what
is
it
your
wife
asked
one
of
the
drunken
soldiers
pointing
to
the
ax
the
tall
peasant
looked
calmly
at
him
from
the
quiet
eyes
under
their
heavy
brows
and
as
calmly
answered
one
meets
a
different
folk
these
days
and
with
an
ax
it
is
much
he
began
to
drink
tea
very
greedily
while
his
eyes
looked
at
me
many
times
with
sharp
inquiry
in
them
and
ran
often
round
the
whole
cabin
in
search
of
the
answer
to
his
doubts
very
slowly
and
with
a
guarded
drawl
he
answered
all
the
questions
of
the
soldiers
between
gulps
of
the
hot
tea
then
he
turned
his
glass
upside
down
as
evidence
of
having
finished
placed
on
the
top
of
it
the
small
lump
of
sugar
left
and
remarked
to
the
soldiers
i
am
going
out
to
look
after
my
horse
and
will
unsaddle
your
horses
for
you
all
right
exclaimed
the
young
soldier
bring
in
our
rifles
as
the
soldiers
were
lying
on
the
benches
and
thus
left
for
us
only
the
floor
the
stranger
soon
came
back
brought
the
rifles
and
set
them
in
the
dark
corner
he
dropped
the
saddle
pads
on
the
floor
sat
down
on
them
and
began
to
take
off
his
boots
the
soldiers
and
my
guest
soon
were
snoring
but
i
did
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
what
next
to
do
finally
as
dawn
was
breaking
i
dozed
off
only
to
awake
in
the
broad
daylight
and
find
my
stranger
gone
i
went
outside
the
hut
and
discovered
him
saddling
a
fine
bay
stallion
are
you
going
away
i
asked
yes
but
i
want
to
go
together
with
these
comrades
he
whispered
and
afterwards
i
shall
come
i
did
not
ask
him
anything
further
and
told
him
only
that
i
would
wait
for
him
he
took
off
the
bags
that
had
been
hanging
on
his
saddle
put
them
away
out
of
sight
in
the
burned
corner
of
the
cabin
looked
over
the
stirrups
and
bridle
and
as
he
finished
saddling
smiled
and
said
i
am
ready
i
m
going
to
awake
my
half
an
hour
after
the
morning
drink
of
tea
my
three
guests
took
their
leave
i
remained
out
of
doors
and
was
engaged
in
splitting
wood
for
my
stove
suddenly
from
a
distance
rifle
shots
rang
through
the
woods
first
one
then
a
second
afterwards
all
was
still
from
the
place
near
the
shots
a
frightened
covey
of
blackcock
broke
and
came
over
me
at
the
top
of
a
high
pine
a
jay
cried
out
i
listened
for
a
long
time
to
see
if
anyone
was
approaching
my
hut
but
everything
was
still
on
the
lower
yenisei
it
grows
dark
very
early
i
built
a
fire
in
my
stove
and
began
to
cook
my
soup
constantly
listening
for
every
noise
that
came
from
beyond
the
cabin
walls
certainly
i
understood
at
all
times
very
clearly
that
death
was
ever
beside
me
and
might
claim
me
by
means
of
either
man
beast
cold
accident
or
disease
i
knew
that
nobody
was
near
me
to
assist
and
that
all
my
help
was
in
the
hands
of
god
in
the
power
of
my
hands
and
feet
in
the
accuracy
of
my
aim
and
in
my
presence
of
mind
however
i
listened
in
vain
i
did
not
notice
the
return
of
my
stranger
like
yesterday
he
appeared
all
at
once
on
the
threshold
through
the
steam
i
made
out
his
laughing
eyes
and
his
fine
face
he
stepped
into
the
hut
and
dropped
with
a
good
deal
of
noise
three
rifles
into
the
corner
two
horses
two
rifles
two
saddles
two
boxes
of
dry
bread
half
a
brick
of
tea
a
small
bag
of
salt
fifty
cartridges
two
overcoats
two
pairs
of
boots
laughingly
he
counted
out
in
truth
today
i
had
a
very
successful
in
astonishment
i
looked
at
him
what
are
you
surprised
at
he
laughed
komu

eti
tovarischi
who
s
got
any
use
for
these
fellows
let
us
have
tea
and
go
to
sleep
tomorrow
i
will
guide
you
to
another
safer
place
and
then
go
chapter
ii
the
secret
of
my
fellow
traveler
at
the
dawn
of
day
we
started
forth
leaving
my
first
place
of
refuge
into
the
bags
we
packed
our
personal
estate
and
fastened
them
on
one
of
the
saddles
we
must
go
four
or
five
hundred
versts
very
calmly
announced
my
fellow
traveler
who
called
himself
ivan
a
name
that
meant
nothing
to
my
mind
or
heart
in
this
land
where
every
second
man
bore
the
same
we
shall
travel
then
for
a
very
long
time
i
remarked
regretfully
not
more
than
one
week
perhaps
even
less
he
answered
that
night
we
spent
in
the
woods
under
the
wide
spreading
branches
of
the
fir
trees
it
was
my
first
night
in
the
forest
under
the
open
sky
how
many
like
this
i
was
destined
to
spend
in
the
year
and
a
half
of
my
wanderings
during
the
day
there
was
very
sharp
cold
under
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
the
frozen
snow
crunched
and
the
balls
that
formed
and
broke
from
their
hoofs
rolled
away
over
the
crust
with
a
sound
like
crackling
glass
the
heathcock
flew
from
the
trees
very
idly
hares
loped
slowly
down
the
beds
of
summer
streams
at
night
the
wind
began
to
sigh
and
whistle
as
it
bent
the
tops
of
the
trees
over
our
heads
while
below
it
was
still
and
calm
we
stopped
in
a
deep
ravine
bordered
by
heavy
trees
where
we
found
fallen
firs
cut
them
into
logs
for
the
fire
and
after
having
boiled
our
tea
dined
ivan
dragged
in
two
tree
trunks
squared
them
on
one
side
with
his
ax
laid
one
on
the
other
with
the
squared
faces
together
and
then
drove
in
a
big
wedge
at
the
butt
ends
which
separated
them
three
or
four
inches
then
we
placed
live
coals
in
this
opening
and
watched
the
fire
run
rapidly
the
whole
length
of
the
squared
faces
now
there
will
be
a
fire
in
the
morning
he
announced
this
is
the
naida
of
the
gold
prospectors
we
prospectors
wandering
in
the
woods
summer
and
winter
always
sleep
beside
this
fine
you
shall
see
for
yourself
he
continued
he
cut
fir
branches
and
made
a
sloping
roof
out
of
them
resting
it
on
two
uprights
toward
the
naida
above
our
roof
of
boughs
and
our
naida
spread
the
branches
of
protecting
fir
more
branches
were
brought
and
spread
on
the
snow
under
the
roof
on
these
were
placed
the
saddle
cloths
and
together
they
made
a
seat
for
ivan
to
rest
on
and
to
take
off
his
outer
garments
down
to
his
blouse
soon
i
noticed
his
forehead
was
wet
with
perspiration
and
that
he
was
wiping
it
and
his
neck
on
his
sleeves
now
it
is
good
and
warm
he
exclaimed
in
a
short
time
i
was
also
forced
to
take
off
my
overcoat
and
soon
lay
down
to
sleep
without
any
covering
at
all
while
through
the
branches
of
the
fir
trees
and
our
roof
glimmered
the
cold
bright
stars
and
just
beyond
the
naida
raged
a
stinging
cold
from
which
we
were
cosily
defended
after
this
night
i
was
no
longer
frightened
by
the
cold
frozen
during
the
days
on
horseback
i
was
thoroughly
warmed
through
by
the
genial
naida
at
night
and
rested
from
my
heavy
overcoat
sitting
only
in
my
blouse
under
the
roofs
of
pine
and
fir
and
sipping
the
ever
welcome
tea
during
our
daily
treks
ivan
related
to
me
the
stories
of
his
wanderings
through
the
mountains
and
woods
of
transbaikalia
in
the
search
for
gold
these
stories
were
very
lively
full
of
attractive
adventure
danger
and
struggle
ivan
was
a
type
of
these
prospectors
who
have
discovered
in
russia
and
perhaps
in
other
countries
the
richest
gold
mines
while
they
themselves
remain
beggars
he
evaded
telling
me
why
he
left
transbaikalia
to
come
to
the
yenisei
i
understood
from
his
manner
that
he
wished
to
keep
his
own
counsel
and
so
did
not
press
him
however
the
blanket
of
secrecy
covering
this
part
of
his
mysterious
life
was
one
day
quite
fortuitously
lifted
a
bit
we
were
already
at
the
objective
point
of
our
trip
the
whole
day
we
had
traveled
with
difficulty
through
a
thick
growth
of
willow
approaching
the
shore
of
the
big
right
branch
of
the
yenisei
the
mana
everywhere
we
saw
runways
packed
hard
by
the
feet
of
the
hares
living
in
this
bush
these
small
white
denizens
of
the
wood
ran
to
and
fro
in
front
of
us
another
time
we
saw
the
red
tail
of
a
fox
hiding
behind
a
rock
watching
us
and
the
unsuspecting
hares
at
the
same
time
ivan
had
been
silent
for
a
long
while
then
he
spoke
up
and
told
me
that
not
far
from
there
was
a
small
branch
of
the
mana
at
the
mouth
of
which
was
a
hut
what
do
you
say
shall
we
push
on
there
or
spend
the
night
by
the
naida
i
suggested
going
to
the
hut
because
i
wanted
to
wash
and
because
it
would
be
agreeable
to
spend
the
night
under
a
genuine
roof
again
ivan
knitted
his
brows
but
acceded
it
was
growing
dark
when
we
approached
a
hut
surrounded
by
the
dense
wood
and
wild
raspberry
bushes
it
contained
one
small
room
with
two
microscopic
windows
and
a
gigantic
russian
stove
against
the
building
were
the
remains
of
a
shed
and
a
cellar
we
fired
the
stove
and
prepared
our
modest
dinner
ivan
drank
from
the
bottle
inherited
from
the
soldiers
and
in
a
short
time
was
very
eloquent
with
brilliant
eyes
and
with
hands
that
coursed
frequently
and
rapidly
through
his
long
locks
he
began
relating
to
me
the
story
of
one
of
his
adventures
but
suddenly
stopped
and
with
fear
in
his
eyes
squinted
into
a
dark
corner
is
it
a
rat
he
asked
i
did
not
see
anything
i
replied
he
again
became
silent
and
reflected
with
knitted
brow
often
we
were
silent
through
long
hours
and
consequently
i
was
not
astonished
ivan
leaned
over
near
to
me
and
began
to
whisper
i
want
to
tell
you
an
old
story
i
had
a
friend
in
transbaikalia
he
was
a
banished
convict
his
name
was
gavronsky
through
many
woods
and
over
many
mountains
we
traveled
in
search
of
gold
and
we
had
an
agreement
to
divide
all
we
got
into
even
shares
but
gavronsky
suddenly
went
out
to
the
taiga
on
the
yenisei
and
disappeared
after
five
years
we
heard
that
he
had
found
a
very
rich
gold
mine
and
had
become
a
rich
man
then
later
that
he
and
his
wife
with
him
had
been
murdered
ivan
was
still
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
this
is
their
old
hut
here
he
lived
with
his
wife
and
somewhere
on
this
river
he
took
out
his
gold
but
he
told
nobody
where
all
the
peasants
around
here
know
that
he
had
a
lot
of
money
in
the
bank
and
that
he
had
been
selling
gold
to
the
government
here
they
were
ivan
stepped
to
the
stove
took
out
a
flaming
stick
and
bending
over
lighted
a
spot
on
the
floor
do
you
see
these
spots
on
the
floor
and
on
the
wall
it
is
their
blood
the
blood
of
gavronsky
they
died
but
they
did
not
disclose
the
whereabouts
of
the
gold
it
was
taken
out
of
a
deep
hole
which
they
had
drifted
into
the
bank
of
the
river
and
was
hidden
in
the
cellar
under
the
shed
but
gavronsky
gave
nothing
away
and
lord
how
i
tortured
them
i
burned
them
with
fire
i
bent
back
their
fingers
i
gouged
out
their
eyes
but
gavronsky
died
in
he
thought
for
a
moment
then
quickly
said
to
me
i
have
heard
all
this
from
the
he
threw
the
log
into
the
stove
and
flopped
down
on
the
bench
it
s
time
to
sleep
he
snapped
out
and
was
still
i
listened
for
a
long
time
to
his
breathing
and
his
whispering
to
himself
as
he
turned
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
smoked
his
pipe
in
the
morning
we
left
this
scene
of
so
much
suffering
and
crime
and
on
the
seventh
day
of
our
journey
we
came
to
the
dense
cedar
wood
growing
on
the
foothills
of
a
long
chain
of
mountains
from
here
ivan
explained
to
me
it
is
eighty
versts
to
the
next
peasant
settlement
the
people
come
to
these
woods
to
gather
cedar
nuts
but
only
in
the
autumn
before
then
you
will
not
meet
anyone
also
you
will
find
many
birds
and
beasts
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
nuts
so
that
it
will
be
possible
for
you
to
live
here
do
you
see
this
river
when
you
want
to
find
the
peasants
follow
along
this
stream
and
it
will
guide
you
to
ivan
helped
me
build
my
mud
hut
but
it
was
not
the
genuine
mud
hut
it
was
one
formed
by
the
tearing
out
of
the
roots
of
a
great
cedar
that
had
probably
fallen
in
some
wild
storm
which
made
for
me
the
deep
hole
as
the
room
for
my
house
and
flanked
this
on
one
side
with
a
wall
of
mud
held
fast
among
the
upturned
roots
overhanging
ones
formed
also
the
framework
into
which
we
interlaced
the
poles
and
branches
to
make
a
roof
finished
off
with
stones
for
stability
and
snow
for
warmth
the
front
of
the
hut
was
ever
open
but
was
constantly
protected
by
the
guardian
naida
in
that
den
i
spent
two
months
like
summer
without
seeing
any
other
human
being
and
without
touch
with
the
outer
world
where
such
important
events
were
transpiring
in
that
grave
under
the
roots
of
the
fallen
tree
i
lived
before
the
face
of
nature
with
my
trials
and
my
anxiety
about
my
family
as
my
constant
companions
and
in
the
hard
struggle
for
my
life
ivan
went
off
the
second
day
leaving
for
me
a
bag
of
dry
bread
and
a
little
sugar
i
never
saw
him
again
chapter
iii
the
struggle
for
life
then
i
was
alone
around
me
only
the
wood
of
eternally
green
cedars
covered
with
snow
the
bare
bushes
the
frozen
river
and
as
far
as
i
could
see
out
through
the
branches
and
the
trunks
of
the
trees
only
the
great
ocean
of
cedars
and
snow
siberian
taiga
how
long
shall
i
be
forced
to
live
here
will
the
bolsheviki
find
me
here
or
not
will
my
friends
know
where
i
am
what
is
happening
to
my
family
these
questions
were
constantly
as
burning
fires
in
my
brain
soon
i
understood
why
ivan
guided
me
so
long
we
passed
many
secluded
places
on
the
journey
far
away
from
all
people
where
ivan
could
have
safely
left
me
but
he
always
said
that
he
would
take
me
to
a
place
where
it
would
be
easier
to
live
and
it
was
so
the
charm
of
my
lone
refuge
was
in
the
cedar
wood
and
in
the
mountains
covered
with
these
forests
which
stretched
to
every
horizon
the
cedar
is
a
splendid
powerful
tree
with
branches
an
eternally
green
tent
attracting
to
its
shelter
every
living
being
among
the
cedars
was
always
effervescent
life
there
the
squirrels
were
continually
kicking
up
a
row
jumping
from
tree
to
tree
the
cried
shrilly
a
flock
of
bullfinches
with
carmine
breasts
swept
through
the
trees
like
a
flame
or
a
small
army
of
goldfinches
broke
in
and
filled
the
amphitheatre
of
trees
with
their
whistling
a
hare
scooted
from
one
tree
trunk
to
another
and
behind
him
stole
up
the
hardly
visible
shadow
of
a
white
ermine
crawling
on
the
snow
and
i
watched
for
a
long
time
the
black
spot
which
i
knew
to
be
the
tip
of
his
tail
carefully
treading
the
hard
crusted
snow
approached
a
noble
deer
at
last
there
visited
me
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
the
king
of
the
siberian
forest
the
brown
bear
all
this
distracted
me
and
carried
away
the
black
thoughts
from
my
brain
encouraging
me
to
persevere
it
was
good
for
me
also
though
difficult
to
climb
to
the
top
of
my
mountain
which
reached
up
out
of
the
forest
and
from
which
i
could
look
away
to
the
range
of
red
on
the
horizon
it
was
the
red
cliff
on
the
farther
bank
of
the
yenisei
there
lay
the
country
the
towns
the
enemies
and
the
friends
and
there
was
even
the
point
which
i
located
as
the
place
of
my
family
it
was
the
reason
why
ivan
had
guided
me
here
and
as
the
days
in
this
solitude
slipped
by
i
began
to
miss
sorely
this
companion
who
though
the
murderer
of
gavronsky
had
taken
care
of
me
like
a
father
always
saddling
my
horse
for
me
cutting
the
wood
and
doing
everything
to
make
me
comfortable
he
had
spent
many
winters
alone
with
nothing
except
his
thoughts
face
to
face
with
nature
i
should
say
before
the
face
of
god
he
had
tried
the
horrors
of
solitude
and
had
acquired
facility
in
bearing
them
i
thought
sometimes
if
i
had
to
meet
my
end
in
this
place
that
i
would
spend
my
last
strength
to
drag
myself
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
to
die
there
looking
away
over
the
infinite
sea
of
mountains
and
forest
toward
the
point
where
my
loved
ones
were
however
the
same
life
gave
me
much
matter
for
reflection
and
yet
more
occupation
for
the
physical
side
it
was
a
continuous
struggle
for
existence
hard
and
severe
the
hardest
work
was
the
preparation
of
the
big
logs
for
the
naida
the
fallen
trunks
of
the
trees
were
covered
with
snow
and
frozen
to
the
ground
i
was
forced
to
dig
them
out
and
afterwards
with
the
help
of
a
long
stick
as
a
lever
to
move
them
from
their
place
for
facilitating
this
work
i
chose
the
mountain
for
my
supplies
where
although
difficult
to
climb
it
was
easy
to
roll
the
logs
down
soon
i
made
a
splendid
discovery
i
found
near
my
den
a
great
quantity
of
larch
this
beautiful
yet
sad
forest
giant
fallen
during
a
big
storm
the
trunks
were
covered
with
snow
but
remained
attached
to
their
stumps
where
they
had
broken
off
when
i
cut
into
these
stumps
with
the
ax
the
head
buried
itself
and
could
with
difficulty
be
drawn
and
investigating
the
reason
i
found
them
filled
with
pitch
chips
of
this
wood
needed
only
a
spark
to
set
them
aflame
and
ever
afterward
i
always
had
a
stock
of
them
to
light
up
quickly
for
warming
my
hands
on
returning
from
the
hunt
or
for
boiling
my
tea
the
greater
part
of
my
days
was
occupied
with
the
hunt
i
came
to
understand
that
i
must
distribute
my
work
over
every
day
for
it
distracted
me
from
my
sad
and
depressing
thoughts
generally
after
my
morning
tea
i
went
into
the
forest
to
seek
heathcock
or
blackcock
after
killing
one
or
two
i
began
to
prepare
my
dinner
which
never
had
an
extensive
menu
it
was
constantly
game
soup
with
a
handful
of
dried
bread
and
afterwards
endless
cups
of
tea
this
essential
beverage
of
the
woods
once
during
my
search
for
birds
i
heard
a
rustle
in
the
dense
shrubs
and
carefully
peering
about
i
discovered
the
points
of
a
deer
s
horns
i
crawled
along
toward
the
spot
but
the
watchful
animal
heard
my
approach
with
a
great
noise
he
rushed
from
the
bush
and
i
saw
him
very
clearly
after
he
had
run
about
three
hundred
steps
stop
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
it
was
a
splendid
animal
with
dark
grey
coat
with
almost
a
black
spine
and
as
large
as
a
small
cow
i
laid
my
rifle
across
a
branch
and
fired
the
animal
made
a
great
leap
ran
several
steps
and
fell
with
all
my
strength
i
ran
to
him
but
he
got
up
again
and
half
jumped
half
dragged
himself
up
the
mountain
the
second
shot
stopped
him
i
had
won
a
warm
carpet
for
my
den
and
a
large
stock
of
meat
the
horns
i
fastened
up
among
the
branches
of
my
wall
where
they
made
a
fine
hat
rack
i
can
not
forget
one
very
interesting
but
wild
picture
which
was
staged
for
me
several
kilometres
from
my
den
there
was
a
small
swamp
covered
with
grass
and
cranberries
scattered
through
it
where
the
blackcock
and
sand
partridges
usually
came
to
feed
on
the
berries
i
approached
noiselessly
behind
the
bushes
and
saw
a
whole
flock
of
blackcock
scratching
in
the
snow
and
picking
out
the
berries
while
i
was
surveying
this
scene
suddenly
one
of
the
blackcock
jumped
up
and
the
rest
of
the
frightened
flock
immediately
flew
away
to
my
astonishment
the
first
bird
began
going
straight
up
in
a
spiral
flight
and
afterwards
dropped
directly
down
dead
when
i
approached
there
sprang
from
the
body
of
the
slain
cock
a
rapacious
ermine
that
hid
under
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
the
bird
s
neck
was
badly
torn
i
then
understood
that
the
ermine
had
charged
the
cock
fastened
itself
on
his
neck
and
had
been
carried
by
the
bird
into
the
air
as
he
sucked
the
blood
from
its
throat
and
had
been
the
cause
of
the
heavy
fall
back
to
the
earth
thanks
to
his
aeronautic
ability
i
saved
one
cartridge
so
i
lived
fighting
for
the
morrow
and
more
and
more
poisoned
by
hard
and
bitter
thoughts
the
days
and
weeks
passed
and
soon
i
felt
the
breath
of
warmer
winds
on
the
open
places
the
snow
began
to
thaw
in
spots
the
little
rivulets
of
water
appeared
another
day
i
saw
a
fly
or
a
spider
awakened
after
the
hard
winter
the
spring
was
coming
i
realized
that
in
spring
it
was
impossible
to
go
out
from
the
forest
every
river
overflowed
its
banks
the
swamps
became
impassable
all
the
runways
of
the
animals
turned
into
beds
for
streams
of
running
water
i
understood
that
until
summer
i
was
condemned
to
a
continuation
of
my
solitude
spring
very
quickly
came
into
her
rights
and
soon
my
mountain
was
free
from
snow
and
was
covered
only
with
stones
the
trunks
of
birch
and
aspen
trees
and
the
high
cones
of
ant
hills
the
river
in
places
broke
its
covering
of
ice
and
was
coursing
full
with
foam
and
bubbles
chapter
iv
a
fisherman
one
day
during
the
hunt
i
approached
the
bank
of
the
river
and
noticed
many
very
large
fish
with
red
backs
as
though
filled
with
blood
they
were
swimming
on
the
surface
enjoying
the
rays
of
the
sun
when
the
river
was
entirely
free
from
ice
these
fish
appeared
in
enormous
quantities
soon
i
realized
that
they
were
working
for
the
spawning
season
in
the
smaller
rivers
i
thought
to
use
a
plundering
method
of
catching
forbidden
by
the
law
of
all
countries
but
all
the
lawyers
and
legislators
should
be
lenient
to
one
who
lives
in
a
den
under
the
roots
of
a
fallen
tree
and
dares
to
break
their
rational
laws
gathering
many
thin
birch
and
aspen
trees
i
built
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
a
weir
which
the
fish
could
not
pass
and
soon
i
found
them
trying
to
jump
over
it
near
the
bank
i
left
a
hole
in
my
barrier
about
eighteen
inches
below
the
surface
and
fastened
on
the
side
a
high
basket
plaited
from
soft
willow
twigs
into
which
the
fish
came
as
they
passed
the
hole
then
i
stood
cruelly
by
and
hit
them
on
the
head
with
a
strong
stick
all
my
catch
were
over
thirty
pounds
some
more
than
eighty
this
variety
of
fish
is
called
the
taimen
is
of
the
trout
family
and
is
the
best
in
the
yenisei
after
two
weeks
the
fish
had
passed
and
my
basket
gave
me
no
more
treasure
so
i
began
anew
the
hunt
chapter
v
a
dangerous
neighbor
the
hunt
became
more
and
more
profitable
and
enjoyable
as
spring
animated
everything
in
the
morning
at
the
break
of
day
the
forest
was
full
of
voices
strange
and
undiscernible
to
the
inhabitant
of
the
town
there
the
heathcock
clucked
and
sang
his
song
of
love
as
he
sat
on
the
top
branches
of
the
cedar
and
admired
the
grey
hen
scratching
in
the
fallen
leaves
below
it
was
very
easy
to
approach
this
caruso
and
with
a
shot
to
bring
him
down
from
his
more
poetic
to
his
more
utilitarian
duties
his
going
out
was
an
euthanasia
for
he
was
in
love
and
heard
nothing
out
in
the
clearing
the
blackcocks
with
their
spotted
tails
were
fighting
while
the
hens
strutting
near
craning
and
chattering
probably
some
gossip
about
their
fighting
swains
watched
and
were
delighted
with
them
from
the
distance
flowed
in
a
stern
and
deep
roar
yet
full
of
tenderness
and
love
the
mating
call
of
the
deer
while
from
the
crags
above
came
down
the
short
and
broken
voice
of
the
mountain
buck
among
the
bushes
frolicked
the
hares
and
often
near
them
a
red
fox
lay
flattened
to
the
ground
watching
his
chance
i
never
heard
any
wolves
and
they
are
usually
not
found
in
the
siberian
regions
covered
with
mountains
and
forest
but
there
was
another
beast
who
was
my
neighbor
and
one
of
us
had
to
go
away
one
day
coming
back
from
the
hunt
with
a
big
heathcock
i
suddenly
noticed
among
the
trees
a
black
moving
mass
i
stopped
and
looking
very
attentively
saw
a
bear
digging
away
at
an
smelling
me
he
snorted
violently
and
very
quickly
shuffled
away
astonishing
me
with
the
speed
of
his
clumsy
gait
the
following
morning
while
still
lying
under
my
overcoat
i
was
attracted
by
a
noise
behind
my
den
i
peered
out
very
carefully
and
discovered
the
bear
he
stood
on
his
hind
legs
and
was
noisily
sniffing
investigating
the
question
as
to
what
living
creature
had
adopted
the
custom
of
the
bears
of
housing
during
the
winter
under
the
trunks
of
fallen
trees
i
shouted
and
struck
my
kettle
with
the
ax
my
early
visitor
made
off
with
all
his
energy
but
his
visit
did
not
please
me
it
was
very
early
in
the
spring
that
this
occurred
and
the
bear
should
not
yet
have
left
his
hibernating
place
he
was
the
an
abnormal
type
of
bear
lacking
in
all
the
etiquette
of
the
first
families
of
the
bear
clan
i
knew
that
the
were
very
irritable
and
audacious
and
quickly
i
prepared
myself
for
both
the
defence
and
the
charge
my
preparations
were
short
i
rubbed
off
the
ends
of
five
of
my
cartridges
thus
making
out
of
them
a
sufficiently
intelligible
argument
for
so
unwelcome
a
guest
putting
on
my
coat
i
went
to
the
place
where
i
had
first
met
the
bear
and
where
there
were
many
i
made
a
detour
of
the
whole
mountain
looked
in
all
the
ravines
but
nowhere
found
my
caller
disappointed
and
tired
i
was
approaching
my
shelter
quite
off
my
guard
when
i
suddenly
discovered
the
king
of
the
forest
himself
just
coming
out
of
my
lowly
dwelling
and
sniffing
all
around
the
entrance
to
it
i
shot
the
bullet
pierced
his
side
he
roared
with
pain
and
anger
and
stood
up
on
his
hind
legs
as
the
second
bullet
broke
one
of
these
he
squatted
down
but
immediately
dragging
the
leg
and
endeavoring
to
stand
upright
moved
to
attack
me
only
the
third
bullet
in
his
breast
stopped
him
he
weighed
about
two
hundred
to
two
hundred
fifty
pounds
as
near
as
i
could
guess
and
was
very
tasty
he
appeared
at
his
best
in
cutlets
but
only
a
little
less
wonderful
in
the
hamburg
steaks
which
i
rolled
and
roasted
on
hot
stones
watching
them
swell
out
into
great
balls
that
were
as
light
as
the
finest
souffle
omelettes
we
used
to
have
at
the
medved
in
petrograd
on
this
welcome
addition
to
my
larder
i
lived
from
then
until
the
ground
dried
out
and
the
stream
ran
down
enough
so
that
i
could
travel
down
along
the
river
to
the
country
whither
ivan
had
directed
me
ever
traveling
with
the
greatest
precautions
i
made
the
journey
down
along
the
river
on
foot
carrying
from
my
winter
quarters
all
my
household
furniture
and
goods
wrapped
up
in
the
deerskin
bag
which
i
formed
by
tying
the
legs
together
in
an
awkward
knot
and
thus
laden
fording
the
small
streams
and
wading
through
the
swamps
that
lay
across
my
path
after
fifty
odd
miles
of
this
i
came
to
the
country
called
sifkova
where
i
found
the
cabin
of
a
peasant
named
tropoff
located
closest
to
the
forest
that
came
to
be
my
natural
environment
with
him
i
lived
for
a
time
now
in
these
unimaginable
surroundings
of
safety
and
peace
summing
up
the
total
of
my
experience
in
the
siberian
taiga
i
make
the
following
deductions
in
every
healthy
spiritual
individual
of
our
times
occasions
of
necessity
resurrect
the
traits
of
primitive
man
hunter
and
warrior
and
help
him
in
the
struggle
with
nature
it
is
the
prerogative
of
the
man
with
the
trained
mind
and
spirit
over
the
untrained
who
does
not
possess
sufficient
science
and
will
power
to
carry
him
through
but
the
price
that
the
cultured
man
must
pay
is
that
for
him
there
exists
nothing
more
awful
than
absolute
solitude
and
the
knowledge
of
complete
isolation
from
human
society
and
the
life
of
moral
and
aesthetic
culture
one
step
one
moment
of
weakness
and
dark
madness
will
seize
a
man
and
carry
him
to
inevitable
destruction
i
spent
awful
days
of
struggle
with
the
cold
and
hunger
but
i
passed
more
terrible
days
in
the
struggle
of
the
will
to
kill
weakening
destructive
thoughts
the
memories
of
these
days
freeze
my
heart
and
mind
and
even
now
as
i
revive
them
so
clearly
by
writing
of
my
experiences
they
throw
me
back
into
a
state
of
fear
and
apprehension
moreover
i
am
compelled
to
observe
that
the
people
in
highly
civilized
states
give
too
little
regard
to
the
training
that
is
useful
to
man
in
primitive
conditions
in
conditions
incident
to
the
struggle
against
nature
for
existence
it
is
the
single
normal
way
to
develop
a
new
generation
of
strong
healthy
iron
men
with
at
the
same
time
sensitive
souls
nature
destroys
the
weak
but
helps
the
strong
awakening
in
the
soul
emotions
which
remain
dormant
under
the
urban
conditions
of
modern
life
chapter
vi
a
river
in
travail
my
presence
in
the
sifkova
country
was
not
for
long
but
i
used
it
in
full
measure
first
i
sent
a
man
in
whom
i
had
confidence
and
whom
i
considered
trustworthy
to
my
friends
in
the
town
that
i
had
left
and
received
from
them
linen
boots
money
and
a
small
case
of
first
aid
materials
and
essential
medicines
and
what
was
most
important
a
passport
in
another
name
since
i
was
dead
for
the
bolsheviki
secondly
in
these
more
or
less
favorable
conditions
i
reflected
upon
the
plan
for
my
future
actions
soon
in
sifkova
the
people
heard
that
the
bolshevik
commissar
would
come
for
the
requisition
of
cattle
for
the
red
army
it
was
dangerous
to
remain
longer
i
waited
only
until
the
yenisei
should
lose
its
massive
lock
of
ice
which
kept
it
sealed
long
after
the
small
rivulets
had
opened
and
the
trees
had
taken
on
their
spring
foliage
for
one
thousand
roubles
i
engaged
a
fisherman
who
agreed
to
take
me
miles
up
the
river
to
an
abandoned
gold
mine
as
soon
as
the
river
which
had
then
only
opened
in
places
should
be
entirely
clear
of
ice
at
last
one
morning
i
heard
a
deafening
roar
like
a
tremendous
cannonade
and
ran
out
to
find
the
river
had
lifted
its
great
bulk
of
ice
and
then
given
way
to
break
it
up
i
rushed
on
down
to
the
bank
where
i
witnessed
an
but
magnificent
scene
the
river
had
brought
down
the
great
volume
of
ice
that
had
been
dislodged
in
the
south
and
was
carrying
it
northward
under
the
thick
layer
which
still
covered
parts
of
the
stream
until
finally
its
weight
had
broken
the
winter
dam
to
the
north
and
released
the
whole
grand
mass
in
one
last
rush
for
the
arctic
the
yenisei
father
yenisei
hero
yenisei
is
one
of
the
longest
rivers
in
asia
deep
and
magnificent
especially
through
the
middle
range
of
its
course
where
it
is
flanked
and
held
in
by
great
towering
ranges
the
huge
stream
had
brought
down
whole
miles
of
ice
fields
breaking
them
up
on
the
rapids
and
on
isolated
rocks
twisting
them
with
angry
swirls
throwing
up
sections
of
the
black
winter
roads
carrying
down
the
tepees
built
for
the
use
of
passing
caravans
which
in
the
winter
always
go
from
minnusinsk
to
krasnoyarsk
on
the
frozen
river
from
time
to
time
the
stream
stopped
in
its
flow
the
roar
began
and
the
great
fields
of
ice
were
squeezed
and
piled
upward
sometimes
as
high
as
thirty
feet
damming
up
the
water
behind
so
that
it
rapidly
rose
and
ran
out
over
the
low
places
casting
on
the
shore
great
masses
of
ice
then
the
power
of
the
reinforced
waters
conquered
the
towering
dam
of
ice
and
carried
it
downward
with
a
sound
like
breaking
glass
at
the
bends
in
the
river
and
round
the
great
rocks
developed
terrifying
chaos
huge
blocks
of
ice
jammed
and
jostled
until
some
were
thrown
clear
into
the
air
crashing
against
others
already
there
or
were
hurled
against
the
curving
cliffs
and
banks
tearing
out
boulders
earth
and
trees
high
up
the
sides
all
along
the
low
embankments
this
giant
of
nature
flung
upward
with
a
suddenness
that
leaves
man
but
a
pigmy
in
force
a
great
wall
of
ice
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
high
which
the
peasants
call
zaberega
and
through
which
they
can
not
get
to
the
river
without
cutting
out
a
road
one
incredible
feat
i
saw
the
giant
perform
when
a
block
many
feet
thick
and
many
yards
square
was
hurled
through
the
air
and
dropped
to
crush
saplings
and
little
trees
more
than
a
half
hundred
feet
from
the
bank
watching
this
glorious
withdrawal
of
the
ice
i
was
filled
with
terror
and
revolt
at
seeing
the
awful
spoils
which
the
yenisei
bore
away
in
this
annual
retreat
these
were
the
bodies
of
the
executed
officers
soldiers
and
cossacks
of
the
former
army
of
the
superior
governor
of
all
russia
admiral
kolchak
they
were
the
results
of
the
bloody
work
of
the
cheka
at
minnusinsk
hundreds
of
these
bodies
with
heads
and
hands
cut
off
with
mutilated
faces
and
bodies
half
burned
with
broken
skulls
floated
and
mingled
with
the
blocks
of
ice
looking
for
their
graves
or
turning
in
the
furious
whirlpools
among
the
jagged
blocks
they
were
ground
and
torn
to
pieces
into
shapeless
masses
which
the
river
nauseated
with
its
task
vomited
out
upon
the
islands
and
projecting
sand
bars
i
passed
the
whole
length
of
the
middle
yenisei
and
constantly
came
across
these
putrifying
and
terrifying
reminders
of
the
work
of
the
bolsheviki
in
one
place
at
a
turn
of
the
river
i
saw
a
great
heap
of
horses
which
had
been
cast
up
by
the
ice
and
current
in
number
not
less
than
three
hundred
a
verst
below
there
i
was
sickened
beyond
endurance
by
the
discovery
of
a
grove
of
willows
along
the
bank
which
had
raked
from
the
polluted
stream
and
held
in
their
drooping
branches
human
bodies
in
all
shapes
and
attitudes
with
a
semblance
of
naturalness
which
made
an
everlasting
picture
on
my
distraught
mind
of
this
pitiful
gruesome
company
i
counted
seventy
at
last
the
mountain
of
ice
passed
by
followed
by
the
muddy
freshets
that
carried
down
the
trunks
of
fallen
trees
logs
and
bodies
bodies
bodies
the
fisherman
and
his
son
put
me
and
my
luggage
into
their
dugout
made
from
an
aspen
tree
and
poled
upstream
along
the
bank
poling
in
a
swift
current
is
very
hard
work
at
the
sharp
curves
we
were
compelled
to
row
struggling
against
the
force
of
the
stream
and
even
in
places
hugging
the
cliffs
and
making
headway
only
by
clutching
the
rocks
with
our
hands
and
dragging
along
slowly
sometimes
it
took
us
a
long
while
to
do
five
or
six
metres
through
these
rapid
holes
in
two
days
we
reached
the
goal
of
our
journey
i
spent
several
days
in
this
gold
mine
where
the
watchman
and
his
family
were
living
as
they
were
short
of
food
they
had
nothing
to
spare
for
me
and
consequently
my
rifle
again
served
to
nourish
me
as
well
as
contributing
something
to
my
hosts
one
day
there
appeared
here
a
trained
agriculturalist
i
did
not
hide
because
during
my
winter
in
the
woods
i
had
raised
a
heavy
beard
so
that
probably
my
own
mother
could
not
have
recognized
me
however
our
guest
was
very
shrewd
and
at
once
deciphered
me
i
did
not
fear
him
because
i
saw
that
he
was
not
a
bolshevik
and
later
had
confirmation
of
this
we
found
common
acquaintances
and
a
common
viewpoint
on
current
events
he
lived
close
to
the
gold
mine
in
a
small
village
where
he
superintended
public
works
we
determined
to
escape
together
from
russia
for
a
long
time
i
had
puzzled
over
this
matter
and
now
my
plan
was
ready
knowing
the
position
in
siberia
and
its
geography
i
decided
that
the
best
way
to
safety
was
through
urianhai
the
northern
part
of
mongolia
on
the
head
waters
of
the
yenisei
then
through
mongolia
and
out
to
the
far
east
and
the
pacific
before
the
overthrow
of
the
kolchak
government
i
had
received
a
commission
to
investigate
urianhai
and
western
mongolia
and
then
with
great
accuracy
i
studied
all
the
maps
and
literature
i
could
get
on
this
question
to
accomplish
this
audacious
plan
i
had
the
great
incentive
of
my
own
safety
chapter
vii
through
soviet
siberia
after
several
days
we
started
through
the
forest
on
the
left
bank
of
the
yenisei
toward
the
south
avoiding
the
villages
as
much
as
possible
in
fear
of
leaving
some
trail
by
which
we
might
be
followed
whenever
we
did
have
to
go
into
them
we
had
a
good
reception
at
the
hands
of
the
peasants
who
did
not
penetrate
our
disguise
and
we
saw
that
they
hated
the
bolsheviki
who
had
destroyed
many
of
their
villages
in
one
place
we
were
told
that
a
detachment
of
red
troops
had
been
sent
out
from
minnusinsk
to
chase
the
whites
we
were
forced
to
work
far
back
from
the
shore
of
the
yenisei
and
to
hide
in
the
woods
and
mountains
here
we
remained
nearly
a
fortnight
because
all
this
time
the
red
soldiers
were
traversing
the
country
and
capturing
in
the
woods
unarmed
officers
who
were
in
hiding
from
the
atrocious
vengeance
of
the
bolsheviki
afterwards
by
accident
we
passed
a
meadow
where
we
found
the
bodies
of
officers
hung
to
the
trees
with
their
faces
and
bodies
mutilated
there
we
determined
never
to
allow
ourselves
to
come
alive
into
the
hands
of
the
boisheviki
to
prevent
this
we
had
our
weapons
and
a
supply
of
cyanide
of
potassium
passing
across
one
branch
of
the
yenisei
once
we
saw
a
narrow
miry
pass
the
entrance
to
which
was
strewn
with
the
bodies
of
men
and
horses
a
little
farther
along
we
found
a
broken
sleigh
with
rifled
boxes
and
papers
scattered
about
near
them
were
also
torn
garments
and
bodies
who
were
these
pitiful
ones
what
tragedy
was
staged
in
this
wild
wood
we
tried
to
guess
this
enigma
and
we
began
to
investigate
the
documents
and
papers
these
were
official
papers
addressed
to
the
staff
of
general
pepelaieff
probably
one
part
of
the
staff
during
the
retreat
of
kolchak
s
army
went
through
this
wood
striving
to
hide
from
the
enemy
approaching
from
all
sides
but
here
they
were
caught
by
the
reds
and
killed
not
far
from
here
we
found
the
body
of
a
poor
unfortunate
woman
whose
condition
proved
clearly
what
had
happened
before
relief
came
through
the
beneficent
bullet
the
body
lay
beside
a
shelter
of
branches
strewn
with
bottles
and
conserve
tins
telling
the
tale
of
the
bantering
feast
that
had
preceded
the
destruction
of
this
life
the
further
we
went
to
the
south
the
more
pronouncedly
hospitable
the
people
became
toward
us
and
the
more
hostile
to
the
bolsheviki
at
last
we
emerged
from
the
forests
and
entered
the
spacious
vastness
of
the
minnusinsk
steppes
crossed
by
the
high
red
mountain
range
called
the
and
dotted
here
and
there
with
salt
lakes
it
is
a
country
of
tombs
thousands
of
large
and
small
dolmens
the
tombs
of
the
earliest
proprietors
of
this
land
pyramids
of
stone
ten
metres
high
the
marks
set
by
jenghiz
khan
along
his
road
of
conquest
and
afterwards
by
the
cripple
thousands
of
these
dolmens
and
stone
pyramids
stretch
in
endless
rows
to
the
north
in
these
plains
the
tartars
now
live
they
were
robbed
by
the
bolsheviki
and
therefore
hated
them
ardently
we
openly
told
them
that
we
were
escaping
they
gave
us
food
for
nothing
and
supplied
us
with
guides
telling
us
with
whom
we
might
stop
and
where
to
hide
in
case
of
danger
after
several
days
we
looked
down
from
the
high
bank
of
the
yenisei
upon
the
first
steamer
the
oriol
from
krasnoyarsk
to
minnusinsk
laden
with
red
soldiers
soon
we
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
tuba
which
we
were
to
follow
straight
east
to
the
sayan
mountains
where
urianhai
begins
we
thought
the
stage
along
the
tuba
and
its
branch
the
amyl
the
most
dangerous
part
of
our
course
because
the
valleys
of
these
two
rivers
had
a
dense
population
which
had
contributed
large
numbers
of
soldiers
to
the
celebrated
communist
partisans
schetinkin
and
krafcheno
a
tartar
ferried
us
and
our
horses
over
to
the
right
bank
of
the
yenisei
and
afterwards
sent
us
some
cossacks
at
daybreak
who
guided
us
to
the
mouth
of
the
tuba
where
we
spent
the
whole
day
in
rest
gratifying
ourselves
with
a
feast
of
wild
black
currants
and
cherries
chapter
viii
three
days
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
armed
with
our
false
passports
we
moved
along
up
the
valley
of
the
tuba
every
ten
or
fifteen
versts
we
came
across
large
villages
of
from
one
to
six
hundred
houses
where
all
administration
was
in
the
hands
of
soviets
and
where
spies
scrutinized
all
we
could
not
avoid
these
villages
for
two
reasons
first
our
attempts
to
avoid
them
when
we
were
constantly
meeting
the
peasants
in
the
country
would
have
aroused
suspicion
and
would
have
caused
any
soviet
to
arrest
us
and
send
us
to
the
cheka
in
minnusinsk
where
we
should
have
sung
our
last
song
secondly
in
his
documents
my
fellow
traveler
was
granted
permission
to
use
the
government
post
relays
for
forwarding
him
on
his
journey
therefore
we
were
forced
to
visit
the
village
soviets
and
change
our
horses
our
own
mounts
we
had
given
to
the
tartar
and
cossack
who
helped
us
at
the
mouth
of
the
tuba
and
the
cossack
brought
us
in
his
wagon
to
the
first
village
where
we
received
the
post
horses
all
except
a
small
minority
of
the
peasants
were
against
the
bolsheviki
and
voluntarily
assisted
us
i
paid
them
for
their
help
by
treating
their
sick
and
my
fellow
traveler
gave
them
practical
advice
in
the
management
of
their
agriculture
those
who
helped
us
chiefly
were
the
old
dissenters
and
the
cossacks
sometimes
we
came
across
villages
entirely
communistic
but
very
soon
we
learned
to
distinguish
them
when
we
entered
a
village
with
our
horse
bells
tinkling
and
found
the
peasants
who
happened
to
be
sitting
in
front
of
their
houses
ready
to
get
up
with
a
frown
and
a
grumble
that
here
were
more
new
devils
coming
we
knew
that
this
was
a
village
opposed
to
the
communists
and
that
here
we
could
stop
in
safety
but
if
the
peasants
approached
and
greeted
us
with
pleasure
calling
us
comrades
we
knew
at
once
that
we
were
among
the
enemy
and
took
great
precautions
such
villages
were
inhabited
by
people
who
were
not
the
siberian
peasants
but
by
emigrants
from
the
ukraine
idle
and
drunk
living
in
poor
dirty
huts
though
their
village
were
surrounded
with
the
black
and
fertile
soil
of
the
steppes
very
dangerous
and
pleasant
moments
we
spent
in
the
large
village
of
karatuz
it
is
rather
a
town
in
the
year
two
colleges
were
opened
here
and
the
population
reached
people
it
is
the
capital
of
the
south
yenisei
cossacks
but
by
now
it
is
very
difficult
to
recognize
this
town
the
peasant
emigrants
and
red
army
murdered
all
the
cossack
population
and
destroyed
and
burned
most
of
the
houses
and
it
is
at
present
the
center
of
bolshevism
and
communism
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
minnusinsk
district
in
the
building
of
the
soviet
where
we
came
to
exchange
our
horses
there
was
being
held
a
meeting
of
the
we
were
immediately
surrounded
and
questioned
about
our
documents
we
were
not
any
too
calm
about
the
impression
which
might
be
made
by
our
papers
and
attempted
to
avoid
this
examination
my
fellow
traveler
afterwards
often
said
to
me
it
is
great
good
fortune
that
among
the
bolsheviki
the
shoemaker
of
yesterday
is
the
governor
of
today
and
scientists
sweep
the
streets
or
clean
the
stables
of
the
red
cavalry
i
can
talk
with
the
bolsheviki
because
they
do
not
know
the
difference
between
disinfection
and
diphtheria
anthracite
and
appendicitis
and
can
talk
them
round
in
all
things
even
up
to
persuading
them
not
to
put
a
bullet
into
and
so
we
talked
the
members
of
the
cheka
round
to
everything
that
we
wanted
we
presented
to
them
a
bright
scheme
for
the
future
development
of
their
district
when
we
would
build
the
roads
and
bridges
which
would
allow
them
to
export
the
wood
from
urianhai
iron
and
gold
from
the
sayan
mountains
cattle
and
furs
from
mongolia
what
a
triumph
of
creative
work
for
the
soviet
government
our
ode
occupied
about
an
hour
and
afterwards
the
members
of
the
cheka
forgetting
about
our
documents
personally
changed
our
horses
placed
our
luggage
on
the
wagon
and
wished
us
success
it
was
the
last
ordeal
within
the
borders
of
russia
when
we
had
crossed
the
valley
of
the
river
amyl
happiness
smiled
on
us
near
the
ferry
we
met
a
member
of
the
militia
from
karatuz
he
had
on
his
wagon
several
rifles
and
automatic
pistols
mostly
mausers
for
outfitting
an
expedition
through
urianhai
in
quest
of
some
cossack
officers
who
had
been
greatly
troubling
the
bolsheviki
we
stood
upon
our
guard
we
could
very
easily
have
met
this
expedition
and
we
were
not
quite
assured
that
the
soldiers
would
be
so
appreciative
of
our
phrases
as
were
the
members
of
the
carefully
questioning
the
militiaman
we
ferreted
out
the
route
their
expedition
was
to
take
in
the
next
village
we
stayed
in
the
same
house
with
him
i
had
to
open
my
luggage
and
suddenly
i
noticed
his
admiring
glance
fixed
upon
my
bag
what
pleases
you
so
much
i
asked
he
whispered
trousers
i
had
received
from
my
townsmen
quite
new
trousers
of
black
thick
cloth
for
riding
those
trousers
attracted
the
rapt
attention
of
the
militiaman
if
you
have
no
other
trousers
i
remarked
reflecting
upon
my
plan
of
attack
against
my
new
friend
no
he
explained
with
sadness
the
soviet
does
not
furnish
trousers
they
tell
me
they
also
go
without
trousers
and
my
trousers
are
absolutely
worn
out
look
at
with
these
words
he
threw
back
the
corner
of
his
overcoat
and
i
was
astonished
how
he
could
keep
himself
inside
these
trousers
for
they
had
such
large
holes
that
they
were
more
of
a
net
than
trousers
a
net
through
which
a
small
shark
could
have
slipped
sell
me
he
whispered
with
a
question
in
his
voice
i
can
not
for
i
need
them
myself
i
answered
decisively
he
reflected
for
a
few
minutes
and
afterward
approaching
me
said
let
us
go
out
doors
and
talk
here
it
is
we
went
outside
now
what
about
it
he
began
you
are
going
into
urianhai
there
the
soviet
have
no
value
and
you
will
not
be
able
to
buy
anything
where
there
are
plenty
of
sables
ermine
and
gold
dust
to
be
purchased
which
they
very
willingly
exchange
for
rifles
and
cartridges
you
have
each
of
you
a
rifle
and
i
will
give
you
one
more
rifle
with
a
hundred
cartridges
if
you
give
me
the
we
do
not
need
weapons
we
are
protected
by
our
documents
i
answered
as
though
i
did
not
understand
but
no
he
interrupted
you
can
change
that
rifle
there
into
furs
and
gold
i
shall
give
you
that
rifle
ah
that
s
it
is
it
but
it
s
very
little
for
those
trousers
nowhere
in
russia
can
you
now
find
trousers
all
russia
goes
without
trousers
and
for
your
rifle
i
should
receive
a
sable
and
what
use
to
me
is
one
skin
word
by
word
i
attained
to
my
desire
the
got
my
trousers
and
i
received
a
rifle
with
one
hundred
cartridges
and
two
automatic
pistols
with
forty
cartridges
each
we
were
armed
now
so
that
we
could
defend
ourselves
moreover
i
persuaded
the
happy
possessor
of
my
trousers
to
give
us
a
permit
to
carry
the
weapons
then
the
law
and
force
were
both
on
our
side
in
a
distant
village
we
bought
three
horses
two
for
riding
and
one
for
packing
engaged
a
guide
purchased
dried
bread
meat
salt
and
butter
and
after
resting
hours
began
our
trip
up
the
amyl
toward
the
sayan
mountains
on
the
border
of
urianhai
there
we
hoped
not
to
meet
bolsheviki
either
sly
or
silly
in
three
days
from
the
mouth
of
the
tuba
we
passed
the
last
russian
village
near
the
border
three
days
of
constant
contact
with
a
lawless
population
of
continuous
danger
and
of
the
ever
present
possibility
of
fortuitous
death
only
iron
will
power
presence
of
mind
and
dogged
tenacity
brought
us
through
all
the
dangers
and
saved
us
from
rolling
back
down
our
precipice
of
adventure
at
whose
foot
lay
so
many
others
who
had
failed
to
make
this
same
climb
to
freedom
which
we
had
just
accomplished
perhaps
they
lacked
the
persistence
or
the
presence
of
mind
perhaps
they
had
not
the
poetic
ability
to
sing
odes
about
roads
bridges
and
gold
mines
or
perhaps
they
simply
had
no
spare
trousers
chapter
ix
to
the
sayans
and
safety
dense
virgin
wood
surrounded
us
in
the
high
already
yellow
grass
the
trail
wound
hardly
noticeable
in
among
bushes
and
trees
just
beginning
to
drop
their
many
colored
leaves
it
is
the
old
already
forgotten
amyl
pass
road
years
ago
it
carried
the
provisions
machinery
and
workers
for
the
numerous
now
abandoned
gold
mines
of
the
amyl
valley
the
road
now
wound
along
the
wide
and
rapid
amyl
then
penetrated
into
the
deep
forest
guiding
us
round
the
swampy
ground
filled
with
those
dangerous
siberian
quagmires
through
the
dense
bushes
across
mountains
and
wide
meadows
our
guide
probably
did
not
surmise
our
real
intention
and
sometimes
apprehensively
looking
down
at
the
ground
would
say
three
riders
on
horses
with
shoes
on
have
passed
here
perhaps
they
were
his
anxiety
was
terminated
when
he
discovered
that
the
tracks
led
off
to
one
side
and
then
returned
to
the
trail
they
did
not
proceed
farther
he
remarked
slyly
smiling
that
s
too
bad
we
answered
it
would
have
been
more
lively
to
travel
in
but
the
peasant
only
stroked
his
beard
and
laughed
evidently
he
was
not
taken
in
by
our
statement
we
passed
on
the
way
a
gold
mine
that
had
been
formerly
planned
and
equipped
on
splendid
lines
but
was
now
abandoned
and
the
buildings
all
destroyed
the
bolsheviki
had
taken
away
the
machinery
supplies
and
also
some
parts
of
the
buildings
nearby
stood
a
dark
and
gloomy
church
with
windows
broken
the
crucifix
torn
off
and
the
tower
burned
a
pitifully
typical
emblem
of
the
russia
of
today
the
starving
family
of
the
watchman
lived
at
the
mine
in
continuing
danger
and
privation
they
told
us
that
in
this
forest
region
were
wandering
about
a
band
of
reds
who
were
robbing
anything
that
remained
on
the
property
of
the
gold
mine
were
working
the
pay
dirt
in
the
richest
part
of
the
mine
and
with
a
little
gold
washed
were
going
to
drink
and
gamble
it
away
in
some
distant
villages
where
the
peasants
were
making
the
forbidden
vodka
out
of
berries
and
potatoes
and
selling
it
for
its
weight
in
gold
a
meeting
with
this
band
meant
death
after
three
days
we
crossed
the
northern
ridge
of
the
sayan
chain
passed
the
border
river
algiak
and
after
this
day
were
abroad
in
the
territory
of
urianhai
this
wonderful
land
rich
in
most
diverse
forms
of
natural
wealth
is
inhabited
by
a
branch
of
the
mongols
which
is
now
only
sixty
thousand
and
which
is
gradually
dying
off
speaking
a
language
quite
different
from
any
of
the
other
dialects
of
this
folk
and
holding
as
their
life
ideal
the
tenet
of
eternal
urianhai
long
ago
became
the
scene
of
administrative
attempts
by
russians
mongols
and
chinese
all
of
whom
claimed
sovereignty
over
the
region
whose
unfortunate
inhabitants
the
soyots
had
to
pay
tribute
to
all
three
of
these
overlords
it
was
due
to
this
that
the
land
was
not
an
entirely
safe
refuge
for
us
we
had
heard
already
from
our
militiaman
about
the
expedition
preparing
to
go
into
urianhai
and
from
the
peasants
we
learned
that
the
villages
along
the
little
yenisei
and
farther
south
had
formed
red
detachments
who
were
robbing
and
killing
everyone
who
fell
into
their
hands
recently
they
had
killed
officers
attempting
to
pass
urianhai
into
mongolia
robbed
and
killed
a
caravan
of
chinese
merchants
and
killed
some
german
war
prisoners
who
escaped
from
the
soviet
paradise
on
the
fourth
day
we
reached
a
swampy
valley
where
among
open
forests
stood
a
single
russian
house
here
we
took
leave
of
our
guide
who
hastened
away
to
get
back
before
the
snows
should
block
his
road
over
the
sayans
the
master
of
the
establishment
agreed
to
guide
us
to
the
seybi
river
for
ten
thousand
roubles
in
soviet
notes
our
horses
were
tired
and
we
were
forced
to
give
them
a
rest
so
we
decided
to
spend
hours
here
we
were
drinking
tea
when
the
daughter
of
our
host
cried
the
soyots
are
coming
into
the
room
with
their
rifles
and
pointed
hats
came
suddenly
four
of
them
mende
they
grunted
to
us
and
then
without
ceremony
began
examining
us
critically
not
a
button
or
a
seam
in
our
entire
outfit
escaped
their
penetrating
gaze
afterwards
one
of
them
who
appeared
to
be
the
local
merin
or
governor
began
to
investigate
our
political
views
listening
to
our
criticisms
of
the
bolsheviki
he
was
evidently
pleased
and
began
talking
freely
you
are
good
people
you
do
not
like
bolsheviki
we
will
help
i
thanked
him
and
presented
him
with
the
thick
silk
cord
which
i
was
wearing
as
a
girdle
before
night
they
left
us
saying
that
they
would
return
in
the
morning
it
grew
dark
we
went
to
the
meadow
to
look
after
our
exhausted
horses
grazing
there
and
came
back
to
the
house
we
were
gaily
chatting
with
the
hospitable
host
when
suddenly
we
heard
horses
hoofs
in
the
court
and
raucous
voices
followed
by
the
immediate
entry
of
five
red
soldiers
armed
with
rifles
and
swords
something
unpleasant
and
cold
rolled
up
into
my
throat
and
my
heart
hammered
we
knew
the
reds
as
our
enemies
these
men
had
the
red
stars
on
their
astrakhan
caps
and
red
triangles
on
their
sleeves
they
were
members
of
the
detachment
that
was
out
to
look
for
cossack
officers
scowling
at
us
they
took
off
their
overcoats
and
sat
down
we
first
opened
the
conversation
explaining
the
purpose
of
our
journey
in
exploring
for
bridges
roads
and
gold
mines
from
them
we
then
learned
that
their
commander
would
arrive
in
a
little
while
with
seven
more
men
and
that
they
would
take
our
host
at
once
as
a
guide
to
the
seybi
river
where
they
thought
the
cossack
officers
must
be
hidden
immediately
i
remarked
that
our
affairs
were
moving
fortunately
and
that
we
must
travel
along
together
one
of
the
soldiers
replied
that
that
would
depend
upon
the
during
our
conversation
the
soyot
governor
entered
very
attentively
he
studied
again
the
new
arrivals
and
then
asked
why
did
you
take
from
the
soyots
the
good
horses
and
leave
bad
ones
the
soldiers
laughed
at
him
remember
that
you
are
in
a
foreign
country
answered
the
soyot
with
a
threat
in
his
voice
god
and
the
devil
cried
one
of
the
soldiers
but
the
soyot
very
calmly
took
a
seat
at
the
table
and
accepted
the
cup
of
tea
the
hostess
was
preparing
for
him
the
conversation
ceased
the
soyot
finished
the
tea
smoked
his
long
pipe
and
standing
up
said
if
tomorrow
morning
the
horses
are
not
back
at
the
owner
s
we
shall
come
and
take
and
with
these
words
he
turned
and
went
out
i
noticed
an
expression
of
apprehension
on
the
faces
of
the
soldiers
shortly
one
was
sent
out
as
a
messenger
while
the
others
sat
silent
with
bowed
heads
late
in
the
night
the
officer
arrived
with
his
other
seven
men
as
he
received
the
report
about
the
soyot
he
knitted
his
brows
and
said
it
s
a
bad
mess
we
must
travel
through
the
swamp
where
a
soyot
will
be
behind
every
mound
watching
he
seemed
really
very
anxious
and
his
trouble
fortunately
prevented
him
from
paying
much
attention
to
us
i
began
to
calm
him
and
promised
on
the
morrow
to
arrange
this
matter
with
the
soyots
the
officer
was
a
coarse
brute
and
a
silly
man
desiring
strongly
to
be
promoted
for
the
capture
of
the
cossack
officers
and
feared
that
the
soyot
could
prevent
him
from
reaching
the
seybi
at
daybreak
we
started
together
with
the
red
detachment
when
we
had
made
about
fifteen
kilometers
we
discovered
behind
the
bushes
two
riders
they
were
soyots
on
their
backs
were
their
flint
rifles
wait
for
me
i
said
to
the
officer
i
shall
go
for
a
parley
with
i
went
forward
with
all
the
speed
of
my
horse
one
of
the
horsemen
was
the
soyot
governor
who
said
to
me
remain
behind
the
detachment
and
help
all
right
i
answered
but
let
us
talk
a
little
in
order
that
they
may
think
we
are
after
a
moment
i
shook
the
hand
of
the
soyot
and
returned
to
the
soldiers
all
right
i
exclaimed
we
can
continue
our
journey
no
hindrance
will
come
from
the
we
moved
forward
and
when
we
were
crossing
a
large
meadow
we
espied
at
a
long
distance
two
soyots
riding
at
full
gallop
right
up
the
side
of
a
mountain
step
by
step
i
accomplished
the
necessary
manoeuvre
to
bring
me
and
my
fellow
traveler
somewhat
behind
the
detachment
behind
our
backs
remained
only
one
soldier
very
brutish
in
appearance
and
apparently
very
hostile
to
us
i
had
time
to
whisper
to
my
companion
only
one
word
mauser
and
saw
that
he
very
carefully
unbuttoned
the
saddle
bag
and
drew
out
a
little
the
handle
of
his
pistol
soon
i
understood
why
these
soldiers
excellent
woodsmen
as
they
were
would
not
attempt
to
go
to
the
seybi
without
a
guide
all
the
country
between
the
algiak
and
the
seybi
is
formed
by
high
and
narrow
mountain
ridges
separated
by
deep
swampy
valleys
it
is
a
cursed
and
dangerous
place
at
first
our
horses
mired
to
the
knees
lunging
about
and
catching
their
feet
in
the
roots
of
bushes
in
the
quagmires
then
falling
and
pinning
us
under
their
sides
breaking
parts
of
their
saddles
and
bridles
then
we
would
go
in
up
to
the
riders
knees
my
horse
went
down
once
with
his
whole
breast
and
head
under
the
red
fluid
mud
and
we
just
saved
it
and
no
more
afterwards
the
officer
s
horse
fell
with
him
so
that
he
bruised
his
head
on
a
stone
my
companion
injured
one
knee
against
a
tree
some
of
the
men
also
fell
and
were
injured
the
horses
breathed
heavily
somewhere
dimly
and
gloomily
a
crow
cawed
later
the
road
became
worse
still
the
trail
followed
through
the
same
miry
swamp
but
everywhere
the
road
was
blocked
with
fallen
tree
trunks
the
horses
jumping
over
the
trunks
would
land
in
an
unexpectedly
deep
hole
and
flounder
we
and
all
the
soldiers
were
covered
with
blood
and
mud
and
were
in
great
fear
of
exhausting
our
mounts
for
a
long
distance
we
had
to
get
down
and
lead
them
at
last
we
entered
a
broad
meadow
covered
with
bushes
and
bordered
with
rocks
not
only
horses
but
riders
also
began
to
sink
to
their
middle
in
a
quagmire
with
apparently
no
bottom
the
whole
surface
of
the
meadow
was
but
a
thin
layer
of
turf
covering
a
lake
with
black
putrefying
water
when
we
finally
learned
to
open
our
column
and
proceed
at
big
intervals
we
found
we
could
keep
on
this
surface
that
undulated
like
rubber
ice
and
swayed
the
bushes
up
and
down
in
places
the
earth
buckled
up
and
broke
suddenly
three
shots
sounded
they
were
hardly
more
than
the
report
of
a
flobert
rifle
but
they
were
genuine
shots
because
the
officer
and
two
soldiers
fell
to
the
ground
the
other
soldiers
grabbed
their
rifles
and
with
fear
looked
about
for
the
enemy
four
more
were
soon
unseated
and
suddenly
i
noticed
our
rearguard
brute
raise
his
rifle
and
aim
right
at
me
however
my
mauser
outstrode
his
rifle
and
i
was
allowed
to
continue
my
story
begin
i
cried
to
my
friend
and
we
took
part
in
the
shooting
soon
the
meadow
began
to
swarm
with
soyots
stripping
the
fallen
dividing
the
spoils
and
recapturing
their
horses
in
some
forms
of
warfare
it
is
never
safe
to
leave
any
of
the
enemy
to
renew
hostilities
later
with
overwhelming
forces
after
an
hour
of
very
difficult
road
we
began
to
ascend
the
mountain
and
soon
arrived
on
a
high
plateau
covered
with
trees
after
all
soyots
are
not
a
too
peaceful
people
i
remarked
approaching
the
governor
he
looked
at
me
very
sharply
and
replied
it
was
not
soyots
who
did
the
he
was
right
it
was
the
abakan
tartars
in
soyot
clothes
who
killed
the
bolsheviki
these
tartars
were
running
their
herds
of
cattle
and
horses
down
out
of
russia
through
urianhai
to
mongolia
they
had
as
their
guide
and
negotiator
a
kalmuck
lamaite
the
following
morning
we
were
approaching
a
small
settlement
of
russian
colonists
and
noticed
some
horsemen
looking
out
from
the
woods
one
of
our
young
and
brave
tartars
galloped
off
at
full
speed
toward
these
men
in
the
wood
but
soon
wheeled
and
returned
with
a
reassuring
smile
all
right
he
exclaimed
laughing
keep
right
we
continued
our
travel
on
a
good
broad
road
along
a
high
wooden
fence
surrounding
a
meadow
filled
with
a
fine
herd
of
wapiti
or
izubr
which
the
russian
colonists
breed
for
the
horns
that
are
so
valuable
in
the
velvet
for
sale
to
tibetan
and
chinese
medicine
dealers
these
horns
when
boiled
and
dried
are
called
panti
and
are
sold
to
the
chinese
at
very
high
prices
we
were
received
with
great
fear
by
the
settlers
thank
god
exclaimed
the
hostess
we
thought
and
she
broke
off
looking
at
her
husband
chapter
x
the
battle
on
the
seybi
constant
dangers
develop
one
s
watchfulness
and
keenness
of
perception
we
did
not
take
off
our
clothes
nor
unsaddle
our
horses
tired
as
we
were
i
put
my
mauser
inside
my
coat
and
began
to
look
about
and
scrutinize
the
people
the
first
thing
i
discovered
was
the
butt
end
of
a
rifle
under
the
pile
of
pillows
always
found
on
the
peasants
large
beds
later
i
noticed
the
employees
of
our
host
constantly
coming
into
the
room
for
orders
from
him
they
did
not
look
like
simple
peasants
although
they
had
long
beards
and
were
dressed
very
dirtily
they
examined
me
with
very
attentive
eyes
and
did
not
leave
me
and
my
friend
alone
with
the
host
we
could
not
however
make
out
anything
but
then
the
soyot
governor
came
in
and
noticing
our
strained
relations
began
explaining
in
the
soyot
language
to
the
host
all
about
us
i
beg
your
pardon
the
colonist
said
but
you
know
yourself
that
now
for
one
honest
man
we
have
ten
thousand
murderers
and
with
this
we
began
chatting
more
freely
it
appeared
that
our
host
knew
that
a
band
of
bolsheviki
would
attack
him
in
the
search
for
the
band
of
cossack
officers
who
were
living
in
his
house
on
and
off
he
had
heard
also
about
the
total
loss
of
one
detachment
however
it
did
not
entirely
calm
the
old
man
to
have
our
news
for
he
had
heard
of
the
large
detachment
of
reds
that
was
coming
from
the
border
of
the
usinsky
district
in
pursuit
of
the
tartars
who
were
escaping
with
their
cattle
south
to
mongolia
from
one
minute
to
another
we
are
awaiting
them
with
fear
said
our
host
to
me
my
soyot
has
come
in
and
announced
that
the
reds
are
already
crossing
the
seybi
and
the
tartars
are
prepared
for
the
we
immediately
went
out
to
look
over
our
saddles
and
packs
and
then
took
the
horses
and
hid
them
in
the
bushes
not
far
off
we
made
ready
our
rifles
and
pistols
and
took
posts
in
the
enclosure
to
wait
for
our
common
enemy
an
hour
of
trying
impatience
passed
when
one
of
the
workmen
came
running
in
from
the
wood
and
whispered
they
are
crossing
our
swamp
the
fight
is
in
fact
like
an
answer
to
his
words
came
through
the
woods
the
sound
of
a
single
followed
closely
by
the
increasing
of
the
mingled
guns
nearer
to
the
house
the
sounds
gradually
came
soon
we
heard
the
beating
of
the
horses
hoofs
and
the
brutish
cries
of
the
soldiers
in
a
moment
three
of
them
burst
into
the
house
from
off
the
road
where
they
were
being
raked
now
by
the
tartars
from
both
directions
cursing
violently
one
of
them
shot
at
our
host
he
stumbled
along
and
fell
on
his
knee
as
his
hand
reached
out
toward
the
rifle
under
his
pillows
who
are
you
brutally
blurted
out
one
of
the
soldiers
turning
to
us
and
raising
his
rifle
we
answered
with
mausers
and
successfully
for
only
one
soldier
in
the
rear
by
the
door
escaped
and
that
merely
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
workman
in
the
courtyard
who
strangled
him
the
fight
had
begun
the
soldiers
called
on
their
comrades
for
help
the
reds
were
strung
along
in
the
ditch
at
the
side
of
the
road
three
hundred
paces
from
the
house
returning
the
fire
of
the
surrounding
tartars
several
soldiers
ran
to
the
house
to
help
their
comrades
but
this
time
we
heard
the
regular
volley
of
the
workmen
of
our
host
they
fired
as
though
in
a
manoeuvre
calmly
and
accurately
five
red
soldiers
lay
on
the
road
while
the
rest
now
kept
to
their
ditch
before
long
we
discovered
that
they
began
crouching
and
crawling
out
toward
the
end
of
the
ditch
nearest
the
wood
where
they
had
left
their
horses
the
sounds
of
shots
became
more
and
more
distant
and
soon
we
saw
fifty
or
sixty
tartars
pursuing
the
reds
across
the
meadow
two
days
we
rested
here
on
the
seybi
the
workmen
of
our
host
eight
in
number
turned
out
to
be
officers
hiding
from
the
bolsheviks
they
asked
permission
to
go
on
with
us
to
which
we
agreed
when
my
friend
and
i
continued
our
trip
we
had
a
guard
of
eight
armed
officers
and
three
horses
with
packs
we
crossed
a
beautiful
valley
between
the
rivers
seybi
and
ut
everywhere
we
saw
splendid
grazing
lands
with
numerous
herds
upon
them
but
in
two
or
three
houses
along
the
road
we
did
not
find
anyone
living
all
had
hidden
away
in
fear
after
hearing
the
sounds
of
the
fight
with
the
reds
the
following
day
we
went
up
over
the
high
chain
of
mountains
called
daban
and
traversing
a
great
area
of
burned
timber
where
our
trail
lay
among
the
fallen
trees
we
began
to
descend
into
a
valley
hidden
from
us
by
the
intervening
foothills
there
behind
these
hills
flowed
the
little
yenisei
the
last
large
river
before
reaching
mongolia
proper
about
ten
kilometers
from
the
river
we
spied
a
column
of
smoke
rising
up
out
of
the
wood
two
of
the
officers
slipped
away
to
make
an
investigation
for
a
long
time
they
did
not
return
and
we
fearful
lest
something
had
happened
moved
off
carefully
in
the
direction
of
the
smoke
all
ready
for
a
fight
if
necessary
we
finally
came
near
enough
to
hear
the
voices
of
many
people
and
among
them
the
loud
laugh
of
one
of
our
scouts
in
the
middle
of
a
meadow
we
made
out
a
large
tent
with
two
tepees
of
branches
and
around
these
a
crowd
of
fifty
or
sixty
men
when
we
broke
out
of
the
forest
all
of
them
rushed
forward
with
a
joyful
welcome
for
us
it
appeared
that
it
was
a
large
camp
of
russian
officers
and
soldiers
who
after
their
escape
from
siberia
had
lived
in
the
houses
of
the
russian
colonists
and
rich
peasants
in
urianhai
what
are
you
doing
here
we
asked
with
surprise
oh
ho
you
know
nothing
at
all
about
what
has
been
going
on
replied
a
fairly
old
man
who
called
himself
colonel
ostrovsky
in
urianhai
an
order
has
been
issued
from
the
military
commissioner
to
mobilize
all
men
over
years
of
age
and
everywhere
toward
the
town
of
belotzarsk
are
moving
detachments
of
these
partisans
they
are
robbing
the
colonists
and
peasants
and
killing
everyone
that
falls
into
their
hands
we
are
hiding
here
from
the
whole
camp
counted
only
sixteen
rifles
and
three
bombs
belonging
to
a
tartar
who
was
traveling
with
his
kalmuck
guide
to
his
herds
in
western
mongolia
we
explained
the
aim
of
our
journey
and
our
intention
to
pass
through
mongolia
to
the
nearest
port
on
the
pacific
the
officers
asked
me
to
bring
them
out
with
us
i
agreed
our
reconnaissance
proved
to
us
that
there
were
no
partisans
near
the
house
of
the
peasant
who
was
to
ferry
us
over
the
little
yenisei
we
moved
off
at
once
in
order
to
pass
as
quickly
as
possible
this
dangerous
zone
of
the
yenisei
and
to
sink
ourselves
into
the
forest
beyond
it
snowed
but
immediately
thawed
before
evening
a
cold
north
wind
sprang
up
bringing
with
it
a
small
blizzard
late
in
the
night
our
party
reached
the
river
our
colonist
welcomed
us
and
offered
at
once
to
ferry
us
over
and
swim
the
horses
although
there
was
ice
still
floating
which
had
come
down
from
the
of
the
stream
during
this
conversation
there
was
present
one
of
the
peasant
s
workmen
and
he
kept
moving
around
all
the
time
and
suddenly
disappeared
our
host
noticed
it
and
with
fear
in
his
voice
said
he
has
run
to
the
village
and
will
guide
the
partisans
here
we
must
cross
then
began
the
most
terrible
night
of
my
whole
journey
we
proposed
to
the
colonist
that
he
take
only
our
food
and
ammunition
in
the
boat
while
we
would
swim
our
horses
across
in
order
to
save
the
time
of
the
many
trips
the
width
of
the
yenisei
in
this
place
is
about
three
hundred
metres
the
stream
is
very
rapid
and
the
shore
breaks
away
abruptly
to
the
full
depth
of
the
stream
the
night
was
absolutely
dark
with
not
a
star
in
the
sky
the
wind
in
whistling
swirls
drove
the
snow
and
sleet
sharply
against
our
faces
before
us
flowed
the
stream
of
black
rapid
water
carrying
down
thin
jagged
blocks
of
ice
twisting
and
grinding
in
the
whirls
and
eddies
for
a
long
time
my
horse
refused
to
take
the
plunge
down
the
steep
bank
snorted
and
braced
himself
with
all
my
strength
i
lashed
him
with
my
whip
across
his
neck
until
with
a
pitiful
groan
he
threw
himself
into
the
cold
stream
we
both
went
all
the
way
under
and
i
hardly
kept
my
seat
in
the
saddle
soon
i
was
some
metres
from
the
shore
with
my
horse
stretching
his
head
and
neck
far
forward
in
his
efforts
and
snorting
and
blowing
incessantly
i
felt
the
every
motion
of
his
feet
churning
the
water
and
the
quivering
of
his
whole
body
under
me
in
this
trial
at
last
we
reached
the
middle
of
the
river
where
the
current
became
exceedingly
rapid
and
began
to
carry
us
down
with
it
out
of
the
ominous
darkness
i
heard
the
shoutings
of
my
companions
and
the
dull
cries
of
fear
and
suffering
from
the
horses
i
was
chest
deep
in
the
icy
water
sometimes
the
floating
blocks
struck
me
sometimes
the
waves
broke
up
over
my
head
and
face
i
had
no
time
to
look
about
or
to
feel
the
cold
the
animal
wish
to
live
took
possession
of
me
i
became
filled
with
the
thought
that
if
my
horse
s
strength
failed
in
his
struggle
with
the
stream
i
must
perish
all
my
attention
was
turned
to
his
efforts
and
to
his
quivering
fear
suddenly
he
groaned
loudly
and
i
noticed
he
was
sinking
the
water
evidently
was
over
his
nostrils
because
the
intervals
of
his
frightened
snorts
through
the
nostrils
became
longer
a
big
block
of
ice
struck
his
head
and
turned
him
so
that
he
was
swimming
right
downstream
with
difficulty
i
reined
him
around
toward
the
shore
but
felt
now
that
his
force
was
gone
his
head
several
times
disappeared
under
the
swirling
surface
i
had
no
choice
i
slipped
from
the
saddle
and
holding
this
by
my
left
hand
swam
with
my
right
beside
my
mount
encouraging
him
with
my
shouts
for
a
time
he
floated
with
lips
apart
and
his
teeth
set
firm
in
his
widely
opened
eyes
was
indescribable
fear
as
soon
as
i
was
out
of
the
saddle
he
had
at
once
risen
in
the
water
and
swam
more
calmly
and
rapidly
at
last
under
the
hoofs
of
my
exhausted
animal
i
heard
the
stones
one
after
another
my
companions
came
up
on
the
shore
the
horses
had
brought
all
their
burdens
over
much
farther
down
our
colonist
landed
with
the
supplies
without
a
moment
s
loss
we
packed
our
things
on
the
horses
and
continued
our
journey
the
wind
was
growing
stronger
and
colder
at
the
dawn
of
day
the
cold
was
intense
our
soaked
clothes
froze
and
became
hard
as
leather
our
teeth
chattered
and
in
our
eyes
showed
the
red
fires
of
fever
but
we
traveled
on
to
put
as
much
space
as
we
could
between
ourselves
and
the
partisans
passing
about
fifteen
kilometres
through
the
forest
we
emerged
into
an
open
valley
from
which
we
could
see
the
opposite
bank
of
the
yenisei
it
was
about
eight
o
clock
along
the
road
on
the
other
shore
wound
the
black
line
of
riders
and
wagons
which
we
made
out
to
be
a
column
of
red
soldiers
with
their
transport
we
dismounted
and
hid
in
the
bushes
in
order
to
avoid
attracting
their
attention
all
the
day
with
the
thermometer
at
zero
and
below
we
continued
our
journey
only
at
night
reaching
the
mountains
covered
with
larch
forests
where
we
made
big
fires
dried
our
clothes
and
warmed
ourselves
thoroughly
the
hungry
horses
did
not
leave
the
fires
but
stood
right
behind
us
with
drooped
heads
and
slept
very
early
in
the
morning
several
soyots
came
to
our
camp
ulan
red
asked
one
of
them
no
no
exclaimed
all
our
company
tzagan
white
followed
the
new
question
yes
yes
said
the
tartar
all
are
mende
mende
they
grunted
and
after
starting
their
cups
of
tea
began
to
relate
very
interesting
and
important
news
it
appeared
that
the
red
partisans
moving
from
the
mountains
tannu
ola
occupied
with
their
outposts
all
the
border
of
mongolia
to
stop
and
seize
the
peasants
and
soyots
driving
out
their
cattle
to
pass
the
tannu
ola
now
would
be
impossible
i
saw
only
one
way
to
turn
sharp
to
the
southeast
pass
the
swampy
valley
of
the
buret
hei
and
reach
the
south
shore
of
lake
kosogol
which
is
already
in
the
territory
of
mongolia
proper
it
was
very
unpleasant
news
to
the
first
mongol
post
in
samgaltai
was
not
more
than
sixty
miles
from
our
camp
while
to
kosogol
by
the
shortest
line
not
less
than
two
hundred
the
horses
my
friend
and
i
were
riding
after
having
traveled
more
than
six
hundred
miles
over
hard
roads
and
without
proper
food
or
rest
could
scarcely
make
such
an
additional
distance
but
reflecting
upon
the
situation
and
studying
my
new
fellow
travelers
i
determined
not
to
attempt
to
pass
the
tannu
ola
they
were
nervous
morally
weary
men
badly
dressed
and
armed
and
most
of
them
were
without
weapons
i
knew
that
during
a
fight
there
is
no
danger
so
great
as
that
of
disarmed
men
they
are
easily
caught
by
panic
lose
their
heads
and
infect
all
the
others
therefore
i
consulted
with
my
friends
and
decided
to
go
to
kosogol
our
company
agreed
to
follow
us
after
luncheon
consisting
of
soup
with
big
lumps
of
meat
dry
bread
and
tea
we
moved
out
about
two
o
clock
the
mountains
began
to
rise
up
before
us
they
were
the
northeast
outspurs
of
the
tannu
ola
behind
which
lay
the
valley
of
buret
hei
chapter
xi
the
barrier
of
red
partisans
in
a
valley
between
two
sharp
ridges
we
discovered
a
herd
of
yaks
and
cattle
being
rapidly
driven
off
to
the
north
by
ten
mounted
soyots
approaching
us
warily
they
finally
revealed
that
noyon
prince
of
todji
had
ordered
them
to
drive
the
herds
along
the
buret
hei
into
mongolia
apprehending
the
pillaging
of
the
red
partisans
they
proceeded
but
were
informed
by
some
soyot
hunters
that
this
part
of
the
tannu
ola
was
occupied
by
the
partisans
from
the
village
of
vladimirovka
consequently
they
were
forced
to
return
we
inquired
from
them
the
whereabouts
of
these
outposts
and
how
many
partisans
were
holding
the
mountain
pass
over
into
mongolia
we
sent
out
the
tartar
and
the
kalmuck
for
a
reconnaissance
while
all
of
us
prepared
for
the
further
advance
by
wrapping
the
feet
of
our
horses
in
our
shirts
and
by
muzzling
their
noses
with
straps
and
bits
of
rope
so
that
they
could
not
neigh
it
was
dark
when
our
investigators
returned
and
reported
to
us
that
about
thirty
partisans
had
a
camp
some
ten
kilometers
from
us
occupying
the
yurtas
of
the
soyots
at
the
pass
were
two
outposts
one
of
two
soldiers
and
the
other
of
three
from
the
outposts
to
the
camp
was
a
little
over
a
mile
our
trail
lay
between
the
two
outposts
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
one
could
plainly
see
the
two
posts
and
could
shoot
them
all
when
we
had
come
near
to
the
top
of
this
mountain
i
left
our
party
and
taking
with
me
my
friend
the
tartar
the
kalmuck
and
two
of
the
young
officers
advanced
from
the
mountain
i
saw
about
five
hundred
yards
ahead
two
fires
at
each
of
the
fires
sat
a
soldier
with
his
rifle
and
the
others
slept
i
did
not
want
to
fight
with
the
partisans
but
we
had
to
do
away
with
these
outposts
and
that
without
firing
or
we
never
should
get
through
the
pass
i
did
not
believe
the
partisans
could
afterwards
track
us
because
the
whole
trail
was
thickly
marked
with
the
spoors
of
horses
and
cattle
i
shall
take
for
my
share
these
two
whispered
my
friend
pointing
to
the
left
outpost
the
rest
of
us
were
to
take
care
of
the
second
post
i
crept
along
through
the
bushes
behind
my
friend
in
order
to
help
him
in
case
of
need
but
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
i
was
not
at
all
worried
about
him
he
was
about
seven
feet
tall
and
so
strong
that
when
a
horse
used
to
refuse
sometimes
to
take
the
bit
he
would
wrap
his
arm
around
its
neck
kick
its
forefeet
out
from
under
it
and
throw
it
so
that
he
could
easily
bridle
it
on
the
ground
when
only
a
hundred
paces
remained
i
stood
behind
the
bushes
and
watched
i
could
see
very
distinctly
the
fire
and
the
dozing
sentinel
he
sat
with
his
rifle
on
his
knees
his
companion
asleep
beside
him
did
not
move
their
white
felt
boots
were
plainly
visible
to
me
for
a
long
time
i
did
not
remark
my
friend
at
the
fire
all
was
quiet
suddenly
from
the
other
outpost
floated
over
a
few
dim
shouts
and
all
was
still
our
sentinel
slowly
raised
his
head
but
just
at
this
moment
the
huge
body
of
my
friend
rose
up
and
blanketed
the
fire
from
me
and
in
a
twinkling
the
feet
of
the
sentinel
flashed
through
the
air
as
my
companion
had
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
swung
him
clear
into
the
bushes
where
both
figures
disappeared
in
a
second
he
flourished
the
rifle
of
the
partisan
over
his
head
and
i
heard
the
dull
blow
which
was
followed
by
an
absolute
calm
he
came
back
toward
me
and
confusedly
smiling
said
it
is
done
god
and
the
devil
when
i
was
a
boy
my
mother
wanted
to
make
a
priest
out
of
me
when
i
grew
up
i
became
a
trained
agronome
in
order
to
strangle
the
people
and
smash
their
skulls
revolution
is
a
very
stupid
thing
and
with
anger
and
disgust
he
spit
and
began
to
smoke
his
pipe
at
the
other
outpost
also
all
was
finished
during
this
night
we
reached
the
top
of
the
tannu
ola
and
descended
again
into
a
valley
covered
with
dense
bushes
and
twined
with
a
whole
network
of
small
rivers
and
streams
it
was
the
headwaters
of
the
buret
hei
about
one
o
clock
we
stopped
and
began
to
feed
our
horses
as
the
grass
just
there
was
very
good
here
we
thought
ourselves
in
safety
we
saw
many
calming
indications
on
the
mountains
were
seen
the
grazing
herds
of
reindeers
and
yaks
and
approaching
soyots
confirmed
our
supposition
here
behind
the
tannu
ola
the
soyots
had
not
seen
the
red
soldiers
we
presented
to
these
soyots
a
brick
of
tea
and
saw
them
depart
happy
and
sure
that
we
were
tzagan
a
good
while
our
horses
rested
and
grazed
on
the
grass
we
sat
by
the
fire
and
deliberated
upon
our
further
progress
there
developed
a
sharp
controversy
between
two
sections
of
our
company
one
led
by
a
colonel
who
with
four
officers
were
so
impressed
by
the
absence
of
reds
south
of
the
tannu
ola
that
they
determined
to
work
westward
to
kobdo
and
then
on
to
the
camp
on
the
emil
river
where
the
chinese
authorities
had
interned
six
thousand
of
the
forces
of
general
bakitch
which
had
come
over
into
mongolian
territory
my
friend
and
i
with
sixteen
of
the
officers
chose
to
carry
through
our
old
plan
to
strike
for
the
shores
of
lake
kosogol
and
thence
out
to
the
far
east
as
neither
side
could
persuade
the
other
to
abandon
its
ideas
our
company
was
divided
and
the
next
day
at
noon
we
took
leave
of
one
another
it
turned
out
that
our
own
wing
of
eighteen
had
many
fights
and
difficulties
on
the
way
which
cost
us
the
lives
of
six
of
our
comrades
but
that
the
remainder
of
us
came
through
to
the
goal
of
our
journey
so
closely
knit
by
the
ties
of
devotion
which
fighting
and
struggling
for
our
very
lives
entailed
that
we
have
ever
preserved
for
one
another
the
warmest
feelings
of
friendship
the
other
group
under
colonel
jukoff
perished
he
met
a
big
detachment
of
red
cavalry
and
was
defeated
by
them
in
two
fights
only
two
officers
escaped
they
related
to
me
this
sad
news
and
the
details
of
the
fights
when
we
met
four
months
later
in
urga
our
band
of
eighteen
riders
with
five
packhorses
moved
up
the
valley
of
the
buret
hei
we
floundered
in
the
swamps
passed
innumerable
miry
streams
were
frozen
by
the
cold
winds
and
were
soaked
through
by
the
snow
and
sleet
but
we
persisted
indefatigably
toward
the
south
end
of
kosogol
as
a
guide
our
tartar
led
us
confidently
over
these
trails
well
marked
by
the
feet
of
many
cattle
being
run
out
of
urianhai
to
mongolia
chapter
xii
in
the
country
of
eternal
peace
the
inhabitants
of
urianhai
the
soyots
are
proud
of
being
the
genuine
buddhists
and
of
retaining
the
pure
doctrine
of
holy
rama
and
the
deep
wisdom
of
they
are
the
eternal
enemies
of
war
and
of
the
shedding
of
blood
away
back
in
the
thirteenth
century
they
preferred
to
move
out
from
their
native
land
and
take
refuge
in
the
north
rather
than
fight
or
become
a
part
of
the
empire
of
the
bloody
conqueror
jenghiz
khan
who
wanted
to
add
to
his
forces
these
wonderful
horsemen
and
skilled
archers
three
times
in
their
history
they
have
thus
trekked
northward
to
avoid
struggle
and
now
no
one
can
say
that
on
the
hands
of
the
soyots
there
has
ever
been
seen
human
blood
with
their
love
of
peace
they
struggled
against
the
evils
of
war
even
the
severe
chinese
administrators
could
not
apply
here
in
this
country
of
peace
the
full
measure
of
their
implacable
laws
in
the
same
manner
the
soyots
conducted
themselves
when
the
russian
people
mad
with
blood
and
crime
brought
this
infection
into
their
land
they
avoided
persistently
meetings
and
encounters
with
the
red
troops
and
partisans
trekking
off
with
their
families
and
cattle
southward
into
the
distant
principalities
of
kemchik
and
soldjak
the
eastern
branch
of
this
stream
of
emigration
passed
through
the
valley
of
the
buret
hei
where
we
constantly
outstrode
groups
of
them
with
their
cattle
and
herds
we
traveled
quickly
along
the
winding
trail
of
the
buret
hei
and
in
two
days
began
to
make
the
elevations
of
the
mountain
pass
between
the
valleys
of
the
buret
hei
and
kharga
the
trail
was
not
only
very
steep
but
was
also
littered
with
fallen
larch
trees
and
frequently
intercepted
incredible
as
it
may
seem
with
swampy
places
where
the
horses
mired
badly
then
again
we
picked
our
dangerous
road
over
cobbles
and
small
stones
that
rolled
away
under
our
horses
feet
and
bumped
off
over
the
precipice
nearby
our
horses
fatigued
easily
in
passing
this
moraine
that
had
been
strewn
by
ancient
glaciers
along
the
mountain
sides
sometimes
the
trail
led
right
along
the
edge
of
the
precipices
where
the
horses
started
great
slides
of
stones
and
sand
i
remember
one
whole
mountain
covered
with
these
moving
sands
we
had
to
leave
our
saddles
and
taking
the
bridles
in
our
hands
to
trot
for
a
mile
or
more
over
these
sliding
beds
sometimes
sinking
in
up
to
our
knees
and
going
down
the
mountain
side
with
them
toward
the
precipices
below
one
imprudent
move
at
times
would
have
sent
us
over
the
brink
this
destiny
met
one
of
our
horses
belly
down
in
the
moving
trap
he
could
not
work
free
to
change
his
direction
and
so
slipped
on
down
with
a
mass
of
it
until
he
rolled
over
the
precipice
and
was
lost
to
us
forever
we
heard
only
the
crackling
of
breaking
trees
along
his
road
to
death
then
with
great
difficulty
we
worked
down
to
salvage
the
saddle
and
bags
further
along
we
had
to
abandon
one
of
our
pack
horses
which
had
come
all
the
way
from
the
northern
border
of
urianhai
with
us
we
first
unburdened
it
but
this
did
not
help
no
more
did
our
shouting
and
threats
he
only
stood
with
his
head
down
and
looked
so
exhausted
that
we
realized
he
had
reached
the
further
bourne
of
his
land
of
toil
some
soyots
with
us
examined
him
felt
of
his
muscles
on
the
fore
and
hind
legs
took
his
head
in
their
hands
and
moved
it
from
side
to
side
examined
his
head
carefully
after
that
and
then
said
that
horse
will
not
go
further
his
brain
is
dried
so
we
had
to
leave
him
that
evening
we
came
to
a
beautiful
change
in
scene
when
we
topped
a
rise
and
found
ourselves
on
a
broad
plateau
covered
with
larch
on
it
we
discovered
the
yurtas
of
some
soyot
hunters
covered
with
bark
instead
of
the
usual
felt
out
of
these
ten
men
with
rifles
rushed
toward
us
as
we
approached
they
informed
us
that
the
prince
of
soldjak
did
not
allow
anyone
to
pass
this
way
as
he
feared
the
coming
of
murderers
and
robbers
into
his
dominions
go
back
to
the
place
from
which
you
came
they
advised
us
with
fear
in
their
eyes
i
did
not
answer
but
i
stopped
the
beginnings
of
a
quarrel
between
an
old
soyot
and
one
of
my
officers
i
pointed
to
the
small
stream
in
the
valley
ahead
of
us
and
asked
him
its
name
oyna
replied
the
soyot
it
is
the
border
of
the
principality
and
the
passage
of
it
is
all
right
i
said
but
you
will
allow
us
to
warm
and
rest
ourselves
a
yes
yes
exclaimed
the
hospitable
soyots
and
led
us
into
their
tepees
on
our
way
there
i
took
the
opportunity
to
hand
to
the
old
soyot
a
cigarette
and
to
another
a
box
of
matches
we
were
all
walking
along
together
save
one
soyot
who
limped
slowly
in
the
rear
and
was
holding
his
hand
up
over
his
nose
is
he
ill
i
asked
yes
sadly
answered
the
old
soyot
that
is
my
son
he
has
been
losing
blood
from
the
nose
for
two
days
and
is
now
quite
i
stopped
and
called
the
young
man
to
me
unbutton
your
outer
coat
i
ordered
bare
your
neck
and
chest
and
turn
your
face
up
as
far
as
you
i
pressed
the
jugular
vein
on
both
sides
of
his
head
for
some
minutes
and
said
to
him
the
blood
will
not
flow
from
your
nose
any
more
go
into
your
tepee
and
lie
down
for
some
the
mysterious
action
of
my
fingers
created
on
the
soyots
a
strong
impression
the
old
soyot
with
fear
and
reverence
whispered
ta
lama
ta
lama
great
doctor
in
the
yurta
we
were
given
tea
while
the
old
soyot
sat
thinking
deeply
about
something
afterwards
he
took
counsel
with
his
companions
and
finally
announced
the
wife
of
our
prince
is
sick
in
her
eyes
and
i
think
the
prince
will
be
very
glad
if
i
lead
the
ta
lama
to
him
he
will
not
punish
me
for
he
ordered
that
no
bad
people
should
be
allowed
to
pass
but
that
should
not
stop
the
good
people
from
coming
to
us
do
as
you
think
best
i
replied
rather
indifferently
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
how
to
treat
eye
diseases
but
i
would
go
back
if
you
say
no
no
the
old
man
exclaimed
with
fear
i
shall
guide
you
sitting
by
the
fire
he
lighted
his
pipe
with
a
flint
wiped
the
mouthpiece
on
his
sleeve
and
offered
it
to
me
in
true
native
hospitality
i
was
comme
il
faut
and
smoked
afterwards
he
offered
his
pipe
to
each
one
of
our
company
and
received
from
each
a
cigarette
a
little
tobacco
or
some
matches
it
was
the
seal
on
our
friendship
soon
in
our
yurta
many
persons
piled
up
around
us
men
women
children
and
dogs
it
was
impossible
to
move
from
among
them
emerged
a
lama
with
shaved
face
and
close
cropped
hair
dressed
in
the
flowing
red
garment
of
his
caste
his
clothes
and
his
expression
were
very
different
from
the
common
mass
of
dirty
soyots
with
their
queues
and
felt
caps
finished
off
with
squirrel
tails
on
the
top
the
lama
was
very
kindly
disposed
towards
us
but
looked
ever
greedily
at
our
gold
rings
and
watches
i
decided
to
exploit
this
avidity
of
the
servant
of
buddha
supplying
him
with
tea
and
dried
bread
i
made
known
to
him
that
i
was
in
need
of
horses
i
have
a
horse
will
you
buy
it
from
me
he
asked
but
i
do
not
accept
russian
bank
notes
let
us
exchange
for
a
long
time
i
bargained
with
him
and
at
last
for
my
gold
wedding
ring
a
raincoat
and
a
leather
saddle
bag
i
received
a
fine
soyot
horse
to
replace
one
of
the
pack
animals
we
had
lost
and
a
young
goat
we
spent
the
night
here
and
were
feasted
with
fat
mutton
in
the
morning
we
moved
off
under
the
guidance
of
the
old
soyot
along
the
trail
that
followed
the
valley
of
the
oyna
free
from
both
mountains
and
swamps
but
we
knew
that
the
mounts
of
my
friend
and
myself
together
with
three
others
were
too
worn
down
to
make
kosogol
and
determined
to
try
to
buy
others
in
soldjak
soon
we
began
to
meet
little
groups
of
soyot
yurtas
with
their
cattle
and
horses
round
about
finally
we
approached
the
shifting
capital
of
the
prince
our
guide
rode
on
ahead
for
the
parley
with
him
after
assuring
us
that
the
prince
would
be
glad
to
welcome
the
ta
lama
though
at
the
time
i
remarked
great
anxiety
and
fear
in
his
features
as
he
spoke
before
long
we
emerged
on
to
a
large
plain
well
covered
with
small
bushes
down
by
the
shore
of
the
river
we
made
out
big
yurtas
with
yellow
and
blue
flags
floating
over
them
and
easily
guessed
that
this
was
the
seat
of
government
soon
our
guide
returned
to
us
his
face
was
wreathed
with
smiles
he
flourished
his
hands
and
cried
noyon
the
prince
asks
you
to
come
he
is
very
glad
from
a
warrior
i
was
forced
to
change
myself
into
a
diplomat
as
we
approached
the
yurta
of
the
prince
we
were
met
by
two
officials
wearing
the
peaked
mongol
caps
with
peacock
feathers
rampants
behind
with
low
obeisances
they
begged
the
foreign
noyon
to
enter
the
yurta
my
friend
the
tartar
and
i
entered
in
the
rich
yurta
draped
with
expensive
silk
we
discovered
a
feeble
little
old
man
with
shaven
face
and
cropped
hair
wearing
also
a
high
pointed
beaver
cap
with
red
silk
apex
topped
off
with
a
dark
red
button
with
the
long
peacock
feathers
streaming
out
behind
on
his
nose
were
big
chinese
spectacles
he
was
sitting
on
a
low
divan
nervously
clicking
the
beads
of
his
rosary
this
was
ta
lama
prince
of
soldjak
and
high
priest
of
the
buddhist
temple
he
welcomed
us
very
cordially
and
invited
us
to
sit
down
before
the
fire
burning
in
the
copper
brazier
his
surprisingly
beautiful
princess
served
us
with
tea
and
chinese
confections
and
cakes
we
smoked
our
pipes
though
the
prince
as
a
lama
did
not
indulge
fulfilling
however
his
duty
as
a
host
by
raising
to
his
lips
the
pipes
we
offered
him
and
handing
us
in
return
the
green
nephrite
bottle
of
snuff
thus
with
the
etiquette
accomplished
we
awaited
the
words
of
the
prince
he
inquired
whether
our
travels
had
been
felicitous
and
what
were
our
further
plans
i
talked
with
him
quite
frankly
and
requested
his
hospitality
for
the
rest
of
our
company
and
for
the
horses
he
agreed
immediately
and
ordered
four
yurtas
set
up
for
us
i
hear
that
the
foreign
noyon
the
prince
said
is
a
good
yes
i
know
some
diseases
and
have
with
me
some
medicines
i
answered
but
i
am
not
a
doctor
i
am
a
scientist
in
other
but
the
prince
did
not
understand
this
in
his
simple
directness
a
man
who
knows
how
to
treat
disease
is
a
doctor
my
wife
has
had
constant
trouble
for
two
months
with
her
eyes
he
announced
help
i
asked
the
princess
to
show
me
her
eyes
and
i
found
the
typical
conjunctivitis
from
the
continual
smoke
of
the
yurta
and
the
general
uncleanliness
the
tartar
brought
me
my
medicine
case
i
washed
her
eyes
with
boric
acid
and
dropped
a
little
cocaine
and
a
feeble
solution
of
sulphurate
of
zinc
into
them
i
beg
you
to
cure
me
pleaded
the
princess
do
not
go
away
until
you
have
cured
me
we
shall
give
you
sheep
milk
and
flour
for
all
your
company
i
weep
now
very
often
because
i
had
very
nice
eyes
and
my
husband
used
to
tell
me
they
shone
like
the
stars
and
now
they
are
red
i
can
not
bear
it
i
can
not
she
very
capriciously
stamped
her
foot
and
coquettishly
smiling
at
me
asked
do
you
want
to
cure
me
yes
the
character
and
manners
of
lovely
woman
are
the
same
everywhere
on
bright
broadway
along
the
stately
thames
on
the
vivacious
boulevards
of
gay
paris
and
in
the
yurta
of
the
soyot
princess
behind
the
larch
covered
tannu
ola
i
shall
certainly
try
assuringly
answered
the
new
oculist
we
spent
here
ten
days
surrounded
by
the
kindness
and
friendship
of
the
whole
family
of
the
prince
the
eyes
of
the
princess
which
eight
years
ago
had
seduced
the
already
old
prince
lama
were
now
recovered
she
was
beside
herself
with
joy
and
seldom
left
her
the
prince
gave
me
five
fairly
good
horses
ten
sheep
and
a
bag
of
flour
which
was
immediately
transformed
into
dry
bread
my
friend
presented
him
with
a
romanoff
note
with
a
picture
of
peter
the
great
upon
it
while
i
gave
to
him
a
small
nugget
of
gold
which
i
had
picked
up
in
the
bed
of
a
stream
the
prince
ordered
one
of
the
soyots
to
guide
us
to
the
kosogol
the
whole
family
of
the
prince
conducted
us
to
the
monastery
ten
kilometres
from
the
we
did
not
visit
the
monastery
but
we
stopped
at
the
dugun
a
chinese
trading
establishment
the
chinese
merchants
looked
at
us
in
a
very
hostile
manner
though
they
simultaneously
offered
us
all
sorts
of
goods
thinking
especially
to
catch
us
with
their
round
bottles
lanhon
of
maygolo
or
sweet
brandy
made
from
aniseed
as
we
had
neither
lump
silver
nor
chinese
dollars
we
could
only
look
with
longing
at
these
attractive
bottles
till
the
prince
came
to
the
rescue
and
ordered
the
chinese
to
put
five
of
them
in
our
saddle
bags
chapter
xiii
mysteries
miracles
and
a
new
fight
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
we
arrived
at
the
sacred
lake
of
teri
noor
a
sheet
of
water
eight
kilometres
across
muddy
and
yellow
with
low
unattractive
shores
studded
with
large
holes
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
lay
what
was
left
of
a
disappearing
island
on
this
were
a
few
trees
and
some
old
ruins
our
guide
explained
to
us
that
two
centuries
ago
the
lake
did
not
exist
and
that
a
very
strong
chinese
fortress
stood
here
on
the
plain
a
chinese
chief
in
command
of
the
fortress
gave
offence
to
an
old
lama
who
cursed
the
place
and
prophesied
that
it
would
all
be
destroyed
the
very
next
day
the
water
began
rushing
up
from
the
ground
destroyed
the
fortress
and
engulfed
all
the
chinese
soldiers
even
to
this
day
when
storms
rage
over
the
lake
the
waters
cast
up
on
the
shores
the
bones
of
men
and
horses
who
perished
in
it
this
teri
noor
increases
its
size
every
year
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
mountains
skirting
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake
we
began
to
climb
a
ridge
the
road
was
easy
at
first
but
the
guide
warned
us
that
the
most
difficult
bit
was
there
ahead
we
reached
this
point
two
days
later
and
found
there
a
steep
mountain
side
thickly
set
with
forest
and
covered
with
snow
beyond
it
lay
the
lines
of
eternal
snow
ridges
studded
with
dark
rocks
set
in
great
banks
of
the
white
mantle
that
gleamed
bright
under
the
clear
sunshine
these
were
the
eastern
and
highest
branches
of
the
tannu
ola
system
we
spent
the
night
beneath
this
wood
and
began
the
passage
of
it
in
the
morning
at
noon
the
guide
began
leading
us
by
zigzags
in
and
out
but
everywhere
our
trail
was
blocked
by
deep
ravines
great
jams
of
fallen
trees
and
walls
of
rock
caught
in
their
mad
tobogganings
from
the
mountain
top
we
struggled
for
several
hours
wore
out
our
horses
and
all
of
a
sudden
turned
up
at
the
place
where
we
had
made
our
last
halt
it
was
very
evident
our
soyot
had
lost
his
way
and
on
his
face
i
noticed
marked
fear
the
old
devils
of
the
cursed
forest
will
not
allow
us
to
pass
he
whispered
with
trembling
lips
it
is
a
very
ominous
sign
we
must
return
to
kharga
to
the
but
i
threatened
him
and
he
took
the
lead
again
evidently
without
hope
or
effort
to
find
the
way
fortunately
one
of
our
party
an
urianhai
hunter
noticed
the
blazes
on
the
trees
the
signs
of
the
road
which
our
guide
had
lost
following
these
we
made
our
way
through
the
wood
came
into
and
crossed
a
belt
of
burned
larch
timber
and
beyond
this
dipped
again
into
a
small
live
forest
bordering
the
bottom
of
the
mountains
crowned
with
the
eternal
snows
it
grew
dark
so
that
we
had
to
camp
for
the
night
the
wind
rose
high
and
carried
in
its
grasp
a
great
white
sheet
of
snow
that
shut
us
off
from
the
horizon
on
every
side
and
buried
our
camp
deep
in
its
folds
our
horses
stood
round
like
white
ghosts
refusing
to
eat
or
to
leave
the
circle
round
our
fire
the
wind
combed
their
manes
and
tails
through
the
niches
in
the
mountains
it
roared
and
whistled
from
somewhere
in
the
distance
came
the
low
rumble
of
a
pack
of
wolves
punctuated
at
intervals
by
the
sharp
individual
barking
that
a
favorable
gust
of
wind
threw
up
into
high
staccato
as
we
lay
by
the
fire
the
soyot
came
over
to
me
and
said
noyon
come
with
me
to
the
obo
i
want
to
show
you
we
went
there
and
began
to
ascend
the
mountain
at
the
bottom
of
a
very
steep
slope
was
laid
up
a

the

the

the

are
angry
they
will
not
allow
us
to
pass
noyon
he
caught
my
hand
and
with
supplicating
voice
whispered
let
us
go
back
noyon
let
us
the
demons
do
not
wish
us
to
pass
their
mountains
for
twenty
years
no
one
has
dared
to
pass
these
mountains
and
all
bold
men
who
have
tried
have
perished
here
the
demons
fell
upon
them
with
snowstorm
and
cold
look
it
is
beginning
already
go
back
to
our
noyon
wait
for
the
warmer
days
and
then
i
did
not
listen
further
to
the
soyot
but
turned
back
to
the
fire
which
i
could
hardly
see
through
the
blinding
snow
fearing
our
guide
might
run
away
i
ordered
a
sentry
to
be
stationed
for
the
night
to
watch
him
later
in
the
night
i
was
awakened
by
the
sentry
who
said
to
me
maybe
i
am
mistaken
but
i
think
i
heard
a
what
could
i
say
to
it
maybe
some
stragglers
like
ourselves
were
giving
a
sign
of
their
whereabouts
to
their
lost
companions
or
perhaps
the
sentry
had
mistaken
for
a
rifle
shot
the
sound
of
some
falling
rock
or
frozen
ice
and
snow
soon
i
fell
asleep
again
and
suddenly
saw
in
a
dream
a
very
clear
vision
out
on
the
plain
blanketed
deep
with
snow
was
moving
a
line
of
riders
they
were
our
pack
horses
our
kalmuck
and
the
funny
pied
horse
with
the
roman
nose
i
saw
us
descending
from
this
snowy
plateau
into
a
fold
in
the
mountains
here
some
larch
trees
were
growing
close
to
which
gurgled
a
small
open
brook
afterwards
i
noticed
a
fire
burning
among
the
trees
and
then
woke
up
it
grew
light
i
shook
up
the
others
and
asked
them
to
prepare
quickly
so
as
not
to
lose
time
in
getting
under
way
the
storm
was
raging
the
snow
blinded
us
and
blotted
out
all
traces
of
the
road
the
cold
also
became
more
intense
at
last
we
were
in
the
saddles
the
soyot
went
ahead
trying
to
make
out
the
trail
as
we
worked
higher
the
guide
less
seldom
lost
the
way
frequently
we
fell
into
deep
holes
covered
with
snow
we
scrambled
up
over
slippery
rocks
at
last
the
soyot
swung
his
horse
round
and
coming
up
to
me
announced
very
positively
i
do
not
want
to
die
with
you
and
i
will
not
go
my
first
motion
was
the
swing
of
my
whip
back
over
my
head
i
was
so
close
to
the
promised
land
of
mongolia
that
this
soyot
standing
in
the
way
of
fulfilment
of
my
wishes
seemed
to
me
my
worst
enemy
but
i
lowered
my
flourishing
hand
into
my
head
flashed
a
quite
wild
thought
listen
i
said
if
you
move
your
horses
you
will
receive
a
bullet
in
the
back
and
you
will
perish
not
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
but
at
the
bottom
and
now
i
will
tell
you
what
will
happen
to
us
when
we
shall
have
reached
these
rocks
above
the
wind
will
have
ceased
and
the
snowstorm
will
have
subsided
the
sun
will
shine
as
we
cross
the
snowy
plain
above
and
afterwards
we
shall
descend
into
a
small
valley
where
there
are
larches
growing
and
a
stream
of
open
running
water
there
we
shall
light
our
fires
and
spend
the
the
soyot
began
to
tremble
with
fright
noyon
has
already
passed
these
mountains
of
darkhat
ola
he
asked
in
amazement
no
i
answered
but
last
night
i
had
a
vision
and
i
know
that
we
shall
fortunately
win
over
this
i
will
guide
you
exclaimed
the
soyot
and
whipping
his
horse
led
the
way
up
the
steep
slope
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
of
eternal
snows
as
we
were
passing
along
the
narrow
edge
of
a
precipice
the
soyot
stopped
and
attentively
examined
the
trail
today
many
shod
horses
have
passed
here
he
cried
through
the
roar
of
the
storm
yonder
on
the
snow
the
lash
of
a
whip
has
been
dragged
these
are
not
the
solution
of
this
enigma
appeared
instantly
a
volley
rang
out
one
of
my
companions
cried
out
as
he
caught
hold
of
his
right
shoulder
one
pack
horse
fell
dead
with
a
bullet
behind
his
ear
we
quickly
tumbled
out
of
our
saddles
lay
down
behind
the
rocks
and
began
to
study
the
situation
we
were
separated
from
a
parallel
spur
of
the
mountain
by
a
small
valley
about
one
thousand
paces
across
there
we
made
out
about
thirty
riders
already
dismounted
and
firing
at
us
i
had
never
allowed
any
fighting
to
be
done
until
the
initiative
had
been
taken
by
the
other
side
our
enemy
fell
upon
us
unawares
and
i
ordered
my
company
to
answer
aim
at
the
horses
cried
colonel
ostrovsky
then
he
ordered
the
tartar
and
soyot
to
throw
our
own
animals
we
killed
six
of
theirs
and
probably
wounded
others
as
they
got
out
of
control
also
our
rifles
took
toll
of
any
bold
man
who
showed
his
head
from
behind
his
rock
we
heard
the
angry
shouting
and
maledictions
of
red
soldiers
who
shot
up
our
position
more
and
more
animatedly
suddenly
i
saw
our
soyot
kick
up
three
of
the
horses
and
spring
into
the
saddle
of
one
with
the
others
in
leash
behind
behind
him
sprang
up
the
tartar
and
the
kalmuck
i
had
already
drawn
my
rifle
on
the
soyot
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
tartar
and
kalmuck
on
their
lovely
horses
behind
him
i
dropped
my
gun
and
knew
all
was
well
the
reds
let
off
a
volley
at
the
trio
but
they
made
good
their
escape
behind
the
rocks
and
disappeared
the
firing
continued
more
and
more
lively
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
from
our
side
we
shot
rarely
saving
our
cartridges
watching
carefully
the
enemy
i
noticed
two
black
points
on
the
snow
high
above
the
reds
they
slowly
approached
our
antagonists
and
finally
were
hidden
from
view
behind
some
sharp
hillocks
when
they
emerged
from
these
they
were
right
on
the
edge
of
some
overhanging
rocks
at
the
foot
of
which
the
reds
lay
concealed
from
us
by
this
time
i
had
no
doubt
that
these
were
the
heads
of
two
men
suddenly
these
men
rose
up
and
i
watched
them
flourish
and
throw
something
that
was
followed
by
two
deafening
roars
which
across
the
mountain
valley
immediately
a
third
explosion
was
followed
by
wild
shouts
and
disorderly
firing
among
the
reds
some
of
the
horses
rolled
down
the
slope
into
the
snow
below
and
the
soldiers
chased
by
our
shots
made
off
as
fast
as
they
could
down
into
the
valley
out
of
which
we
had
come
afterward
the
tartar
told
me
the
soyot
had
proposed
to
guide
them
around
behind
the
reds
to
fall
upon
their
rear
with
the
bombs
when
i
had
bound
up
the
wounded
shoulder
of
the
officer
and
we
had
taken
the
pack
off
the
killed
animal
we
continued
our
journey
our
position
was
complicated
we
had
no
doubt
that
the
red
detachment
came
up
from
mongolia
therefore
were
there
red
troops
in
mongolia
what
was
their
strength
where
might
we
meet
them
consequently
mongolia
was
no
more
the
promised
land
very
sad
thoughts
took
possession
of
us
but
nature
pleased
us
the
wind
gradually
fell
the
storm
ceased
the
sun
more
and
more
frequently
broke
through
the
scudding
clouds
we
were
traveling
upon
a
high
plateau
where
in
one
place
the
wind
blew
it
clean
and
in
another
piled
it
high
with
drifts
which
caught
our
horses
and
held
them
so
that
they
could
hardly
extricate
themselves
at
times
we
had
to
dismount
and
wade
through
the
white
piles
up
to
our
waists
and
often
a
man
or
horse
was
down
and
had
to
be
helped
to
his
feet
at
last
the
descent
began
and
at
sunset
we
stopped
in
the
small
larch
grove
spent
the
night
at
the
fire
among
the
trees
and
drank
the
tea
boiled
in
the
water
carried
from
the
open
mountain
brook
in
various
places
we
came
across
the
tracks
of
our
recent
antagonists
everything
even
nature
herself
and
the
angry
demons
of
darkhat
ola
had
helped
us
but
we
were
not
gay
because
again
before
us
lay
the
dread
uncertainty
that
threatened
us
with
new
and
possibly
destructive
dangers
chapter
xiv
the
river
of
the
devil
ulan
taiga
with
darkhat
ola
lay
behind
us
we
went
forward
very
rapidly
because
the
mongol
plains
began
here
free
from
the
impediments
of
mountains
everywhere
splendid
grazing
lands
stretched
away
in
places
there
were
groves
of
larch
we
crossed
some
very
rapid
streams
but
they
were
not
deep
and
they
had
hard
beds
after
two
days
of
travel
over
the
darkhat
plain
we
began
meeting
soyots
driving
their
cattle
rapidly
toward
the
northwest
into
orgarkha
ola
they
communicated
to
us
very
unpleasant
news
the
bolsheviki
from
the
irkutsk
district
had
crossed
the
mongolian
border
captured
the
russian
colony
at
khathyl
on
the
southern
shore
of
lake
kosogol
and
turned
off
south
toward
muren
kure
a
russian
settlement
beside
a
big
lamaite
monastery
sixty
miles
south
of
kosogol
the
mongols
told
us
there
were
no
russian
troops
between
khathyl
and
muren
kure
so
we
decided
to
pass
between
these
two
points
to
reach
van
kure
farther
to
the
east
we
took
leave
of
our
soyot
guide
and
after
having
sent
three
scouts
in
advance
moved
forward
from
the
mountains
around
the
kosogol
we
admired
the
splendid
view
of
this
broad
alpine
lake
it
was
set
like
a
sapphire
in
the
old
gold
of
the
surrounding
hills
chased
with
lovely
bits
of
rich
dark
forestry
at
night
we
approached
khathyl
with
great
precaution
and
stopped
on
the
shore
of
the
river
that
flows
from
kosogol
the
yaga
or
egingol
we
found
a
mongol
who
agreed
to
transport
us
to
the
other
bank
of
the
frozen
stream
and
to
lead
us
by
a
safe
road
between
khathyl
and
muren
kure
everywhere
along
the
shore
of
the
river
were
found
large
obo
and
small
shrines
to
the
demons
of
the
stream
why
are
there
so
many
obo
we
asked
the
mongol
it
is
the
river
of
the
devil
dangerous
and
crafty
replied
the
mongol
two
days
ago
a
train
of
carts
went
through
the
ice
and
three
of
them
with
five
soldiers
were
we
started
to
cross
the
surface
of
the
river
resembled
a
thick
piece
of
being
clear
and
without
snow
our
horses
walked
very
carefully
but
some
fell
and
floundered
before
they
could
regain
their
feet
we
were
leading
them
by
the
bridle
with
bowed
heads
and
trembling
all
over
they
kept
their
frightened
eyes
ever
on
the
ice
at
their
feet
i
looked
down
and
understood
their
fear
through
the
cover
of
one
foot
of
transparent
ice
one
could
clearly
see
the
bottom
of
the
river
under
the
lighting
of
the
moon
all
the
stones
the
holes
and
even
some
of
the
grasses
were
distinctly
visible
even
though
the
depth
was
ten
metres
and
more
the
yaga
rushed
under
the
ice
with
a
furious
speed
swirling
and
marking
its
course
with
long
bands
of
foam
and
bubbles
suddenly
i
jumped
and
stopped
as
though
fastened
to
the
spot
along
the
surface
of
the
river
ran
the
boom
of
a
cannon
followed
by
a
second
and
a
third
quicker
quicker
cried
our
mongol
waving
us
forward
with
his
hand
another
cannon
boom
and
a
crack
ran
right
close
to
us
the
horses
swung
back
on
their
haunches
in
protest
reared
and
fell
many
of
them
striking
their
heads
severely
on
the
ice
in
a
second
it
opened
up
two
feet
wide
so
that
i
could
follow
its
jagged
course
along
the
surface
immediately
up
out
of
the
opening
the
water
spread
over
the
ice
with
a
rush
hurry
hurry
shouted
the
guide
with
great
difficulty
we
forced
our
horses
to
jump
over
this
cleavage
and
to
continue
on
further
they
trembled
and
disobeyed
and
only
the
strong
lash
forced
them
to
forget
this
panic
of
fear
and
go
on
when
we
were
safe
on
the
farther
bank
and
well
into
the
woods
our
mongol
guide
recounted
to
us
how
the
river
at
times
opens
in
this
mysterious
way
and
leaves
great
areas
of
clear
water
all
the
men
and
animals
on
the
river
at
such
times
must
perish
the
furious
current
of
cold
water
will
always
carry
them
down
under
the
ice
at
other
times
a
crack
has
been
known
to
pass
right
under
a
horse
and
where
he
fell
in
with
his
front
feet
in
the
attempt
to
get
back
to
the
other
side
the
crack
has
closed
up
and
ground
his
legs
or
feet
right
off
the
valley
of
kosogol
is
the
crater
of
an
extinct
volcano
its
outlines
may
be
followed
from
the
high
west
shore
of
the
lake
however
the
plutonic
force
still
acts
and
asserting
the
glory
of
the
devil
forces
the
mongols
to
build
obo
and
offer
sacrifices
at
his
shrines
we
spent
all
the
night
and
all
the
next
day
hurrying
away
eastward
to
avoid
a
meeting
with
the
reds
and
seeking
good
pasturage
for
our
horses
at
about
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
a
fire
shone
out
of
the
distance
my
friend
and
i
made
toward
it
with
the
feeling
that
it
was
surely
a
mongol
yurta
beside
which
we
could
camp
in
safety
we
traveled
over
a
mile
before
making
out
distinctly
the
lines
of
a
group
of
yurtas
but
nobody
came
out
to
meet
us
and
what
astonished
us
more
we
were
not
surrounded
by
the
angry
black
mongolian
dogs
with
fiery
eyes
still
from
the
distance
we
had
seen
the
fire
and
so
there
must
be
someone
there
we
dismounted
from
our
horses
and
approached
on
foot
from
out
of
the
yurta
rushed
two
russian
soldiers
one
of
whom
shot
at
me
with
his
pistol
but
missed
me
and
wounded
my
horse
in
the
back
through
the
saddle
i
brought
him
to
earth
with
my
mauser
and
the
other
was
killed
by
the
butt
end
of
my
friend
s
rifle
we
examined
the
bodies
and
found
in
their
pockets
the
papers
of
soldiers
of
the
second
squadron
of
the
communist
interior
defence
here
we
spent
the
night
the
owners
of
the
yurtas
had
evidently
run
away
for
the
red
soldiers
had
collected
and
packed
in
sacks
the
property
of
the
mongols
probably
they
were
just
planning
to
leave
as
they
were
fully
dressed
we
acquired
two
horses
which
we
found
in
the
bushes
two
rifles
and
two
automatic
pistols
with
cartridges
in
the
saddle
bags
we
also
found
tea
tobacco
matches
and
cartridges
all
of
these
valuable
supplies
to
help
us
keep
further
hold
on
our
lives
two
days
later
we
were
approaching
the
shore
of
the
river
uri
when
we
met
two
russian
riders
who
were
the
cossacks
of
a
certain
ataman
sutunin
acting
against
the
bolsheviki
in
the
valley
of
the
river
selenga
they
were
riding
to
carry
a
message
from
sutunin
to
kaigorodoff
chief
of
the
in
the
altai
region
they
informed
us
that
along
the
whole
border
the
bolshevik
troops
were
scattered
also
that
communist
agitators
had
penetrated
to
kiakhta
ulankom
and
kobdo
and
had
persuaded
the
chinese
authorities
to
surrender
to
the
soviet
authorities
all
the
refugees
from
russia
we
knew
that
in
the
neighborhood
of
urga
and
van
kure
engagements
were
taking
place
between
the
chinese
troops
and
the
detachments
of
the
russian
general
baron
ungern
sternberg
and
colonel
kazagrandi
who
were
fighting
for
the
independence
of
outer
mongolia
baron
ungern
had
now
been
twice
defeated
so
that
the
chinese
were
carrying
on
in
urga
suspecting
all
foreigners
of
having
relations
with
the
russian
general
we
realized
that
the
whole
situation
was
sharply
reversed
the
route
to
the
pacific
was
closed
reflecting
very
carefully
over
the
problem
i
decided
that
we
had
but
one
possible
exit
left
we
must
avoid
all
mongolian
cities
with
chinese
administration
cross
mongolia
from
north
to
south
traverse
the
desert
in
the
southern
part
of
the
principality
of
jassaktu
khan
enter
the
gobi
in
the
western
part
of
inner
mongolia
strike
as
rapidly
as
possible
through
sixty
miles
of
chinese
territory
in
the
province
of
kansu
and
penetrate
into
tibet
here
i
hoped
to
search
out
one
of
the
english
consuls
and
with
his
help
to
reach
some
english
port
in
india
i
understood
thoroughly
all
the
difficulties
incident
to
such
an
enterprise
but
i
had
no
other
choice
it
only
remained
to
make
this
last
foolish
attempt
or
to
perish
without
doubt
at
the
hands
of
the
boisheviki
or
languish
in
a
chinese
prison
when
i
announced
my
plan
to
my
companions
without
in
any
way
hiding
from
them
all
its
dangers
and
quixotism
all
of
them
answered
very
quickly
and
shortly
lead
us
we
will
one
circumstance
was
distinctly
in
our
favor
we
did
not
fear
hunger
for
we
had
some
supplies
of
tea
tobacco
and
matches
and
a
surplus
of
horses
saddles
rifles
overcoats
and
boots
which
were
an
excellent
currency
for
exchange
so
then
we
began
to
initiate
the
plan
of
the
new
expedition
we
should
start
to
the
south
leaving
the
town
of
uliassutai
on
our
right
and
taking
the
direction
of
zaganluk
then
pass
through
the
waste
lands
of
the
district
of
balir
of
jassaktu
khan
cross
the
naron
khuhu
gobi
and
strike
for
the
mountains
of
boro
here
we
should
be
able
to
take
a
long
rest
to
recuperate
the
strength
of
our
horses
and
of
ourselves
the
second
section
of
our
journey
would
be
the
passage
through
the
western
part
of
inner
mongolia
through
the
little
gobi
through
the
lands
of
the
torguts
over
the
khara
mountains
across
kansu
where
our
road
must
be
chosen
to
the
west
of
the
chinese
town
of
suchow
from
there
we
should
have
to
enter
the
dominion
of
kuku
nor
and
then
work
on
southward
to
the
head
waters
of
the
yangtze
river
beyond
this
i
had
but
a
hazy
notion
which
however
i
was
able
to
verify
from
a
map
of
asia
in
the
possession
of
one
of
the
officers
to
the
effect
that
the
mountain
chains
to
the
west
of
the
sources
of
the
yangtze
separated
that
river
system
from
the
basin
of
the
brahmaputra
in
tibet
proper
where
i
expected
to
be
able
to
find
english
assistance
chapter
xv
the
march
of
ghosts
in
no
other
way
can
i
describe
the
journey
from
the
river
ero
to
the
border
of
tibet
about
eleven
hundred
miles
through
the
snowy
steppes
over
mountains
and
across
deserts
we
traveled
in
days
we
hid
from
the
people
as
we
journeyed
made
short
stops
in
the
most
desolate
places
fed
for
whole
weeks
on
nothing
but
raw
frozen
meat
in
order
to
avoid
attracting
attention
by
the
smoke
of
fires
whenever
we
needed
to
purchase
a
sheep
or
a
steer
for
our
supply
department
we
sent
out
only
two
unarmed
men
who
represented
to
the
natives
that
they
were
the
workmen
of
some
russian
colonists
we
even
feared
to
shoot
although
we
met
a
great
herd
of
antelopes
numbering
as
many
as
five
thousand
head
behind
balir
in
the
lands
of
the
lama
jassaktu
khan
who
had
inherited
his
throne
as
a
result
of
the
poisoning
of
his
brother
at
urga
by
order
of
the
living
buddha
we
met
wandering
russian
tartars
who
had
driven
their
herds
all
the
way
from
altai
and
abakan
they
welcomed
us
very
cordially
gave
us
oxen
and
bricks
of
tea
also
they
saved
us
from
inevitable
destruction
for
they
told
us
that
at
this
season
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
horses
to
make
the
trip
across
the
gobi
where
there
was
no
grass
at
all
we
must
buy
camels
by
exchanging
for
them
our
horses
and
some
other
of
our
bartering
supplies
one
of
the
tartars
the
next
day
brought
to
their
camp
a
rich
mongol
with
whom
he
drove
the
bargain
for
this
trade
he
gave
us
nineteen
camels
and
took
all
our
horses
one
rifle
one
pistol
and
the
best
cossack
saddle
he
advised
us
by
all
means
to
visit
the
sacred
monastery
of
narabanchi
the
last
lamaite
monastery
on
the
road
from
mongolia
to
tibet
he
told
us
that
the
holy
hutuktu
the
incarnate
buddha
would
be
greatly
offended
if
we
did
not
visit
the
monastery
and
his
famous
shrine
of
blessings
where
all
travelers
going
to
tibet
always
offered
prayers
our
kalmuck
lamaite
supported
the
mongol
in
this
i
decided
to
go
there
with
the
kalmuck
the
tartars
gave
me
some
big
silk
hatyk
as
presents
and
loaned
us
four
splendid
horses
although
the
monastery
was
miles
distant
by
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
i
entered
the
yurta
of
this
holy
hutuktu
he
was
a
clean
shaven
spare
little
man
laboring
under
the
name
of
jelyb
djamsrap
hutuktu
he
received
us
very
cordially
and
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
presentation
of
the
hatyk
and
with
my
knowledge
of
the
mongol
etiquette
in
which
my
tartar
had
been
long
and
persistently
instructing
me
he
listened
to
me
most
attentively
and
gave
valuable
advice
about
the
road
presenting
me
then
with
a
ring
which
has
since
opened
for
me
the
doors
of
all
lamaite
monasteries
the
name
of
this
hutuktu
is
highly
esteemed
not
only
in
all
mongolia
but
in
tibet
and
in
the
lamaite
world
of
china
we
spent
the
night
in
his
splendid
yurta
and
on
the
following
morning
visited
the
shrines
where
they
were
conducting
very
solemn
services
with
the
music
of
gongs
and
whistling
the
lamas
with
their
deep
voices
were
intoning
the
prayers
while
the
lesser
priests
answered
with
their
antiphonies
the
sacred
phrase
om
mani
padme
hung
was
endlessly
repeated
the
hutuktu
wished
us
success
presented
us
with
a
large
yellow
hatyk
and
accompanied
us
to
the
monastery
gate
when
we
were
in
our
saddles
he
said
remember
that
you
are
always
welcome
guests
here
life
is
very
complicated
and
anything
may
happen
perhaps
you
will
be
forced
in
future
to
distant
mongolia
and
then
do
not
miss
narabanchi
that
night
we
returned
to
the
tartars
and
the
next
day
continued
our
journey
as
i
was
very
tired
the
slow
easy
motion
of
the
camel
was
welcome
and
restful
to
me
all
the
day
i
dozed
off
at
intervals
to
sleep
it
turned
out
to
be
very
disastrous
for
me
for
when
my
camel
was
going
up
the
steep
bank
of
a
river
in
one
of
my
naps
i
fell
off
and
hit
my
head
on
a
stone
lost
consciousness
and
woke
up
to
find
my
overcoat
covered
with
blood
my
friends
surrounded
me
with
their
frightened
faces
they
bandaged
my
head
and
we
started
off
again
i
only
learned
long
afterwards
from
a
doctor
who
examined
me
that
i
had
cracked
my
skull
as
the
price
of
my
siesta
we
crossed
the
eastern
ranges
of
the
altai
and
the
karlik
tag
which
are
the
most
oriental
sentinels
the
great
tian
shan
system
throws
out
into
the
regions
of
the
gobi
and
then
traversed
from
the
north
to
the
south
the
entire
width
of
the
khuhu
gobi
intense
cold
ruled
all
this
time
and
fortunately
the
frozen
sands
gave
us
better
speed
before
passing
the
khara
range
we
exchanged
our
steeds
for
horses
a
deal
in
which
the
torguts
skinned
us
badly
like
the
true
old
clothes
men
they
are
skirting
around
these
mountains
we
entered
kansu
it
was
a
dangerous
move
for
the
chinese
were
arresting
all
refugees
and
i
feared
for
my
russian
during
the
days
we
hid
in
the
ravines
the
forests
and
bushes
making
forced
marches
at
night
four
days
we
thus
used
in
this
passage
of
kansu
the
few
chinese
peasants
we
did
encounter
were
peaceful
appearing
and
most
hospitable
a
marked
sympathetic
interest
surrounded
the
kalmuck
who
could
speak
a
bit
of
chinese
and
my
box
of
medicines
everywhere
we
found
many
ill
people
chiefly
afflicted
with
eye
troubles
rheumatism
and
skin
diseases
as
we
were
approaching
nan
shan
the
northeast
branch
of
the
altyn
tag
which
is
in
turn
the
east
branch
of
the
pamir
and
karakhorum
system
we
overhauled
a
large
caravan
of
chinese
merchants
going
to
tibet
and
joined
them
for
three
days
we
were
winding
through
the
endless
valleys
of
these
mountains
and
ascending
the
high
passes
but
we
noticed
that
the
chinese
knew
how
to
pick
the
easiest
routes
for
caravans
over
all
these
difficult
places
in
a
state
of
i
made
this
whole
journey
toward
the
large
group
of
swampy
lakes
feeding
the
koko
nor
and
a
whole
network
of
large
rivers
from
fatigue
and
constant
nervous
strain
probably
helped
by
the
blow
on
my
head
i
began
suffering
from
sharp
attacks
of
chills
and
fever
burning
up
at
times
and
then
chattering
so
with
my
teeth
that
i
frightened
my
horse
who
several
times
threw
me
from
the
saddle
i
raved
cried
out
at
times
and
even
wept
i
called
my
family
and
instructed
them
how
they
must
come
to
me
i
remember
as
though
through
a
dream
how
i
was
taken
from
the
horse
by
my
companions
laid
on
the
ground
supplied
with
chinese
brandy
and
when
i
recovered
a
little
how
they
said
to
me
the
chinese
merchants
are
heading
for
the
west
and
we
must
travel
no
to
the
north
i
replied
very
sharply
but
no
to
the
south
my
companions
assured
me
god
and
the
devil
i
angrily
ejaculated
we
have
just
swum
the
little
yenisei
and
algyak
is
to
the
north
we
are
in
tibet
remonstrated
my
companions
we
must
reach
the
brahmaputra
brahmaputra
this
word
revolved
in
my
fiery
brain
made
a
terrible
noise
and
commotion
suddenly
i
remembered
everything
and
opened
my
eyes
i
hardly
moved
my
lips
and
soon
i
again
lost
consciousness
my
companions
brought
me
to
the
monastery
of
sharkhe
where
the
lama
doctor
quickly
brought
me
round
with
a
solution
of
fatil
or
chinese
ginseng
in
discussing
our
plans
he
expressed
grave
doubt
as
to
whether
we
would
get
through
tibet
but
he
did
not
wish
to
explain
to
me
the
reason
for
his
doubts
chapter
xvi
in
mysterious
tibet
a
fairly
broad
road
led
out
from
sharkhe
through
the
mountains
and
on
the
fifth
day
of
our
two
weeks
march
to
the
south
from
the
monastery
we
emerged
into
the
great
bowl
of
the
mountains
in
whose
center
lay
the
large
lake
of
koko
nor
if
finland
deserves
the
ordinary
title
of
the
land
of
ten
thousand
lakes
the
dominion
of
koko
nor
may
certainly
with
justice
be
called
the
country
of
a
million
we
skirted
this
lake
on
the
west
between
it
and
doulan
kitt
zigzagging
between
the
numerous
swamps
lakes
and
small
rivers
deep
and
miry
the
water
was
not
here
covered
with
ice
and
only
on
the
tops
of
the
mountains
did
we
feel
the
cold
winds
sharply
we
rarely
met
the
natives
of
the
country
and
only
with
greatest
difficulty
did
our
kalmuck
learn
the
course
of
the
road
from
the
occasional
shepherds
we
passed
from
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake
of
tassoun
we
worked
round
to
a
monastery
on
the
further
side
where
we
stopped
for
a
short
rest
besides
ourselves
there
was
also
another
group
of
guests
in
the
holy
place
these
were
tibetans
their
behavior
was
very
impertinent
and
they
refused
to
speak
with
us
they
were
all
armed
chiefly
with
the
russian
military
rifles
and
were
draped
with
crossed
bandoliers
of
cartridges
with
two
or
three
pistols
stowed
beneath
belts
with
more
cartridges
sticking
out
they
examined
us
very
sharply
and
we
readily
realized
that
they
were
estimating
our
martial
strength
after
they
had
left
on
that
same
day
i
ordered
our
kalmuck
to
inquire
from
the
high
priest
of
the
temple
exactly
who
they
were
for
a
long
time
the
monk
gave
evasive
answers
but
when
i
showed
him
the
ring
of
hutuktu
narabanchi
and
presented
him
with
a
large
yellow
hatyk
he
became
more
communicative
those
are
bad
people
he
explained
have
a
care
of
however
he
was
not
willing
to
give
their
names
explaining
his
refusal
by
citing
the
law
of
buddhist
lands
against
pronouncing
the
name
of
one
s
father
teacher
or
chief
afterwards
i
found
out
that
in
north
tibet
there
exists
the
same
custom
as
in
north
china
here
and
there
bands
of
hunghutze
wander
about
they
appear
at
the
headquarters
of
the
leading
trading
firms
and
at
the
monasteries
claim
tribute
and
after
their
collections
become
the
protectors
of
the
district
probably
this
tibetan
monastery
had
in
this
band
just
such
protectors
when
we
continued
our
trip
we
frequently
noticed
single
horsemen
far
away
or
on
the
horizon
apparently
studying
our
movements
with
care
all
our
attempts
to
approach
them
and
enter
into
conversation
with
them
were
entirely
unsuccessful
on
their
speedy
little
horses
they
disappeared
like
shadows
as
we
reached
the
steep
and
difficult
pass
on
the
hamshan
and
were
preparing
to
spend
the
night
there
suddenly
far
up
on
a
ridge
above
us
appeared
about
forty
horsemen
with
entirely
white
mounts
and
without
formal
introduction
or
warning
spattered
us
with
a
hail
of
bullets
two
of
our
officers
fell
with
a
cry
one
had
been
instantly
killed
while
the
other
lived
some
few
minutes
i
did
not
allow
my
men
to
shoot
but
instead
i
raised
a
white
flag
and
started
forward
with
the
kalmuck
for
a
parley
at
first
they
fired
two
shots
at
us
but
then
ceased
firing
and
sent
down
a
group
of
riders
from
the
ridge
toward
us
we
began
the
parley
the
tibetans
explained
that
hamshan
is
a
holy
mountain
and
that
here
one
must
not
spend
the
night
advising
us
to
proceed
farther
where
we
could
consider
ourselves
in
safety
they
inquired
from
us
whence
we
came
and
whither
we
were
going
stated
in
answer
to
our
information
about
the
purpose
of
our
journey
that
they
knew
the
bolsheviki
and
considered
them
the
liberators
of
the
people
of
asia
from
the
yoke
of
the
white
race
i
certainly
did
not
want
to
begin
a
political
quarrel
with
them
and
so
turned
back
to
our
companions
riding
down
the
slope
toward
our
camp
i
waited
momentarily
for
a
shot
in
the
back
but
the
tibetan
hunghutze
did
not
shoot
we
moved
forward
leaving
among
the
stones
the
bodies
of
two
of
our
companions
as
sad
tribute
to
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
our
journey
we
rode
all
night
with
our
exhausted
horses
constantly
stopping
and
some
lying
down
under
us
but
we
forced
them
ever
onward
at
last
when
the
sun
was
at
its
zenith
we
finally
halted
without
unsaddling
our
horses
we
gave
them
an
opportunity
to
lie
down
for
a
little
rest
before
us
lay
a
broad
swampy
plain
where
was
evidently
the
sources
of
the
river
not
far
beyond
lay
the
lake
of
aroung
nor
we
made
our
fire
of
cattle
dung
and
began
boiling
water
for
our
tea
again
without
any
warning
the
bullets
came
raining
in
from
all
sides
immediately
we
took
cover
behind
convenient
rocks
and
waited
developments
the
firing
became
faster
and
closer
the
raiders
appeared
on
the
whole
circle
round
us
and
the
bullets
came
ever
in
increasing
numbers
we
had
fallen
into
a
trap
and
had
no
hope
but
to
perish
we
realized
this
clearly
i
tried
anew
to
begin
the
parley
but
when
i
stood
up
with
my
white
flag
the
answer
was
only
a
thicker
rain
of
bullets
and
unfortunately
one
of
these
ricocheting
off
a
rock
struck
me
in
the
left
leg
and
lodged
there
at
the
same
moment
another
one
of
our
company
was
killed
we
had
no
other
choice
and
were
forced
to
begin
fighting
the
struggle
continued
for
about
two
hours
besides
myself
three
others
received
slight
wounds
we
resisted
as
long
as
we
could
the
hunghutze
approached
and
our
situation
became
desperate
there
s
no
choice
said
one
of
my
associates
a
very
expert
colonel
we
must
mount
and
ride
for
it
anywhere
it
was
a
terrible
word
we
consulted
for
but
an
instant
it
was
apparent
that
with
this
band
of
behind
us
the
farther
we
went
into
tibet
the
less
chance
we
had
of
saving
our
lives
we
decided
to
return
to
mongolia
but
how
that
we
did
not
know
and
thus
we
began
our
retreat
firing
all
the
time
we
trotted
our
horses
as
fast
as
we
could
toward
the
north
one
after
another
three
of
my
companions
fell
there
lay
my
tartar
with
a
bullet
through
his
neck
after
him
two
young
and
fine
stalwart
officers
were
carried
from
their
saddles
with
cries
of
death
while
their
scared
horses
broke
out
across
the
plain
in
wild
fear
perfect
pictures
of
our
distraught
selves
this
emboldened
the
tibetans
who
became
more
and
more
audacious
a
bullet
struck
the
buckle
on
the
ankle
strap
of
my
right
foot
and
carried
it
with
a
piece
of
leather
and
cloth
into
my
leg
just
above
the
ankle
my
old
and
much
tried
friend
the
agronome
cried
out
as
he
grasped
his
shoulder
and
then
i
saw
him
wiping
and
bandaging
as
best
as
he
could
his
bleeding
forehead
a
second
afterward
our
kalmuck
was
hit
twice
right
through
the
palm
of
the
same
hand
so
that
it
was
entirely
shattered
just
at
this
moment
fifteen
of
the
hunghutze
rushed
against
us
in
a
charge
shoot
at
them
with
volley
fire
commanded
our
colonel
six
robber
bodies
lay
on
the
turf
while
two
others
of
the
gang
were
unhorsed
and
ran
scampering
as
fast
as
they
could
after
their
retreating
fellows
several
minutes
later
the
fire
of
our
antagonists
ceased
and
they
raised
a
white
flag
two
riders
came
forward
toward
us
in
the
parley
it
developed
that
their
chief
had
been
wounded
through
the
chest
and
they
came
to
ask
us
to
render
first
at
once
i
saw
a
ray
of
hope
i
took
my
box
of
medicines
and
my
groaning
cursing
wounded
kalmuck
to
interpret
for
me
give
that
devil
some
cyanide
of
potassium
urged
my
companions
but
i
devised
another
scheme
we
were
led
to
the
wounded
chief
there
he
lay
on
the
saddle
cloths
among
the
rocks
represented
to
us
to
be
a
tibetan
but
i
at
once
recognized
him
from
his
cast
of
countenance
to
be
a
sart
or
turcoman
probably
from
the
southern
part
of
turkestan
he
looked
at
me
with
a
begging
and
frightened
gaze
examining
him
i
found
the
bullet
had
passed
through
his
chest
from
left
to
right
that
he
had
lost
much
blood
and
was
very
weak
conscientiously
i
did
all
that
i
could
for
him
in
the
first
place
i
tried
on
my
own
tongue
all
the
medicines
to
be
used
on
him
even
the
iodoform
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
no
poison
among
them
i
cauterized
the
wound
with
iodine
sprinkled
it
with
iodoform
and
applied
the
bandages
i
ordered
that
the
wounded
man
be
not
touched
nor
moved
and
that
he
be
left
right
where
he
lay
then
i
taught
a
tibetan
how
the
dressing
must
be
changed
and
left
with
him
medicated
cotton
bandages
and
a
little
iodoform
to
the
patient
in
whom
the
fever
was
already
developing
i
gave
a
big
dose
of
aspirin
and
left
several
tablets
of
quinine
with
them
afterwards
addressing
myself
to
the
bystanders
through
my
kalmuck
i
said
very
solemnly
the
wound
is
very
dangerous
but
i
gave
to
your
chief
very
strong
medicine
and
hope
that
he
will
recover
one
condition
however
is
necessary
the
bad
demons
which
have
rushed
to
his
side
for
his
unwarranted
attack
upon
us
innocent
travelers
will
instantly
kill
him
if
another
shot
is
let
off
against
us
you
must
not
even
keep
a
single
cartridge
in
your
with
these
words
i
ordered
the
kalmuck
to
empty
his
rifle
and
i
at
the
same
time
took
all
the
cartridges
out
of
my
mauser
the
tibetans
instantly
and
very
servilely
followed
my
example
remember
that
i
told
you
eleven
days
and
eleven
nights
do
not
move
from
this
place
and
do
not
charge
your
otherwise
the
demon
of
death
will
snatch
off
your
chief
and
will
pursue
you
and
with
these
words
i
solemnly
drew
forth
and
raised
above
their
heads
the
ring
of
hutuktu
narabanchi
i
returned
to
my
companions
and
calmed
them
i
told
them
we
were
safe
against
further
attack
from
the
robbers
and
that
we
must
only
guess
the
way
to
reach
mongolia
our
horses
were
so
exhausted
and
thin
that
on
their
bones
we
could
have
hung
our
overcoats
we
spent
two
days
here
during
which
time
i
frequently
visited
my
patient
it
also
gave
us
opportunity
to
bandage
our
own
fortunately
light
wounds
and
to
secure
a
little
rest
though
unfortunately
i
had
nothing
but
a
jackknife
with
which
to
dig
the
bullet
out
of
my
left
calf
and
the
shoemaker
s
accessories
from
my
right
ankle
inquiring
from
the
brigands
about
the
caravan
roads
we
soon
made
our
way
out
to
one
of
the
main
routes
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
there
the
caravan
of
the
young
mongol
prince
pounzig
who
was
on
a
holy
mission
carrying
a
message
from
the
living
buddha
in
urga
to
the
dalai
lama
in
lhasa
he
helped
us
to
purchase
horses
camels
and
food
with
all
our
arms
and
supplies
spent
in
barter
during
the
journey
for
the
purchase
of
transport
and
food
we
returned
stripped
and
broken
to
the
narabanchi
monastery
where
we
were
welcomed
by
the
hutuktu
i
knew
you
would
come
back
said
he
the
divinations
revealed
it
all
to
with
six
of
our
little
band
left
behind
us
in
tibet
to
pay
the
eternal
toll
of
our
dash
for
the
south
we
returned
but
twelve
to
the
monastery
and
waited
there
two
weeks
to
ourselves
and
learn
how
events
would
again
set
us
afloat
on
this
turbulent
sea
to
steer
for
any
port
that
destiny
might
indicate
the
officers
enlisted
in
the
detachment
which
was
then
being
formed
in
mongolia
to
fight
against
the
destroyers
of
their
native
land
the
bolsheviki
my
original
companion
and
i
prepared
to
continue
our
journey
over
mongolian
plains
with
whatever
further
adventures
and
dangers
might
come
in
the
struggle
to
escape
to
a
place
of
safety
and
now
with
the
scenes
of
that
trying
march
so
vividly
recalled
i
would
dedicate
these
chapters
to
my
gigantic
old
and
ruggedly
tried
friend
the
agronome
to
my
russian
and
especially
to
the
sacred
memory
of
those
of
our
companions
whose

lie
cradled

destitute
and

from

s
cataclysm
that
is
mongolia
in
this
land
by
order
of
fate
after
my
unsuccessful
attempt
to
reach
the
indian
ocean
through
tibet
i
spent
half
a
year
in
the
struggle
to
live
and
to
escape
my
old
and
faithful
friend
and
i
were
compelled
to
participate
in
the
exceedingly
important
and
dangerous
events
transpiring
in
mongolia
in
the
year
of
grace
thanks
to
this
i
came
to
know
the
calm
good
and
honest
mongolian
people
i
read
their
souls
saw
their
sufferings
and
hopes
i
witnessed
the
whole
horror
of
their
oppression
and
fear
before
the
face
of
mystery
there
where
mystery
pervades
all
life
i
watched
the
rivers
during
the
severe
cold
break
with
a
rumbling
roar
their
chains
of
ice
saw
lakes
cast
up
on
their
shores
the
bones
of
human
beings
heard
unknown
wild
voices
in
the
mountain
ravines
made
out
the
fires
over
miry
swamps
of
the
witnessed
burning
lakes
gazed
upward
to
mountains
whose
peaks
could
not
be
scaled
came
across
great
balls
of
writhing
snakes
in
the
ditches
in
winter
met
with
streams
which
are
eternally
frozen
rocks
like
petrified
caravans
of
camels
horsemen
and
carts
and
over
all
saw
the
barren
mountains
whose
folds
looked
like
the
mantle
of
satan
which
the
glow
of
the
evening
sun
drenched
with
blood
look
up
there
cried
an
old
shepherd
pointing
to
the
slope
of
the
cursed
zagastai
that
is
no
mountain
it
is
he
who
lies
in
his
red
mantle
and
awaits
the
day
when
he
will
rise
again
to
begin
the
fight
with
the
good
and
as
he
spoke
i
recalled
the
mystic
picture
of
the
noted
painter
vroubel
the
same
nude
mountains
with
the
violet
and
purple
robes
of
satan
whose
face
is
half
covered
by
an
approaching
grey
cloud
mongolia
is
a
terrible
land
of
mystery
and
demons
therefore
it
is
no
wonder
that
here
every
violation
of
the
ancient
order
of
life
of
the
wandering
nomad
tribes
is
transformed
into
streams
of
red
blood
and
horror
ministering
to
the
demonic
pleasure
of
satan
couched
on
the
bare
mountains
and
robed
in
the
grey
cloak
of
dejection
and
sadness
or
in
the
purple
mantle
of
war
and
vengeance
after
returning
from
the
district
of
koko
nor
to
mongolia
and
resting
a
few
days
at
the
narabanchi
monastery
we
went
to
live
in
uliassutai
the
capital
of
western
outer
mongolia
it
is
the
last
purely
mongolian
town
to
the
west
in
mongolia
there
are
but
three
purely
mongolian
towns
urga
uliassutai
and
ulankom
the
fourth
town
kobdo
has
an
essentially
chinese
character
being
the
center
of
chinese
administration
in
this
district
inhabited
by
the
wandering
tribes
only
nominally
recognizing
the
influence
of
either
peking
or
urga
in
uliassutai
and
ulankom
besides
the
unlawful
chinese
commissioners
and
troops
there
were
stationed
mongolian
governors
or
saits
appointed
by
the
decree
of
the
living
buddha
when
we
arrived
in
that
town
we
were
at
once
in
the
sea
of
political
passions
the
mongols
were
protesting
in
great
agitation
against
the
chinese
policy
in
their
country
the
chinese
raged
and
demanded
from
the
mongolians
the
payment
of
taxes
for
the
full
period
since
the
autonomy
of
mongolia
had
been
forcibly
extracted
from
peking
russian
colonists
who
had
years
before
settled
near
the
town
and
in
the
vicinity
of
the
great
monasteries
or
among
the
wandering
tribes
had
separated
into
factions
and
were
fighting
against
one
another
from
urga
came
the
news
of
the
struggle
for
the
maintenance
of
the
independence
of
outer
mongolia
led
by
the
russian
general
baron
ungern
von
sternberg
russian
officers
and
refugees
congregated
in
detachments
against
which
the
chinese
authorities
protested
but
which
the
mongols
welcomed
the
bolsheviki
worried
by
the
formation
of
white
detachments
in
mongolia
sent
their
troops
to
the
borders
of
mongolia
from
irkutsk
and
chita
to
uliassutai
and
urga
envoys
were
running
from
the
bolsheviki
to
the
chinese
commissioners
with
various
proposals
of
all
kinds
the
chinese
authorities
in
mongolia
were
gradually
entering
into
secret
relations
with
the
bolsheviki
and
in
kiakhta
and
ulankom
delivered
to
them
the
russian
refugees
thus
violating
recognized
international
law
in
urga
the
bolsheviki
set
up
a
russian
communistic
municipality
russian
consuls
were
inactive
red
troops
in
the
region
of
kosogol
and
the
valley
of
the
selenga
had
encounters
with
officers
the
chinese
authorities
established
garrisons
in
the
mongolian
towns
and
sent
punitive
expeditions
into
the
country
and
to
complete
the
confusion
the
chinese
troops
carried
out
searches
during
which
they
plundered
and
stole
into
what
an
atmosphere
we
had
fallen
after
our
hard
and
dangerous
trip
along
the
yenisei
through
urianhai
mongolia
the
lands
of
the
turguts
kansu
and
koko
nor
do
you
know
said
my
old
friend
to
me
i
prefer
strangling
partisans
and
fighting
with
the
hunghutze
to
listening
to
news
and
more
anxious
news
he
was
right
for
the
worst
of
it
was
that
in
this
bustle
and
whirl
of
facts
rumours
and
gossip
the
reds
could
approach
troubled
uliassutai
and
take
everyone
with
their
bare
hands
we
should
very
willingly
have
left
this
town
of
uncertainties
but
we
had
no
place
to
go
in
the
north
were
the
hostile
partisans
and
red
troops
to
the
south
we
had
already
lost
our
companions
and
not
a
little
of
our
own
blood
to
the
west
raged
the
chinese
administrators
and
detachments
and
to
the
east
a
war
had
broken
out
the
news
of
which
in
spite
of
the
attempts
of
the
chinese
authorities
at
secrecy
had
filtered
through
and
had
testified
to
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
in
this
part
of
outer
mongolia
consequently
we
had
no
choice
but
to
remain
in
uliassutai
here
also
were
living
several
polish
soldiers
who
had
escaped
from
the
prison
camps
in
russia
two
polish
families
and
two
american
firms
all
in
the
same
plight
as
ourselves
we
joined
together
and
made
our
own
intelligence
department
very
carefully
watching
the
evolution
of
events
we
succeeded
in
forming
good
connections
with
the
chinese
commissioner
and
with
the
mongolian
sait
which
greatly
helped
us
in
our
orientation
what
was
behind
all
these
events
in
mongolia
the
very
clever
mongol
sait
of
uliassutai
gave
me
the
following
explanation
according
to
the
agreements
between
mongolia
china
and
russia
of
october
of
october
and
of
june
outer
mongolia
was
accorded
independence
and
the
moral
head
of
our
yellow
faith
his
holiness
the
living
buddha
became
the
suzerain
of
the
mongolian
people
of
khalkha
or
outer
mongolia
with
the
title
of
bogdo
djebtsung
damba
hutuktu
while
russia
was
still
strong
and
carefully
watched
her
policy
in
asia
the
government
of
peking
kept
the
treaty
but
when
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
with
germany
russia
was
compelled
to
withdraw
her
troops
from
siberia
peking
began
to
claim
the
return
of
its
lost
rights
in
mongolia
it
was
because
of
this
that
the
first
two
treaties
of
and
were
supplemented
by
the
convention
of
however
in
when
all
the
forces
of
russia
were
in
the
unsuccessful
war
and
afterwards
when
the
first
russian
revolution
broke
out
in
february
overthrowing
the
romanoff
dynasty
the
chinese
government
openly
retook
mongolia
they
changed
all
the
mongolian
ministers
and
saits
replacing
them
with
individuals
friendly
to
china
arrested
many
mongolian
autonomists
and
sent
them
to
prison
in
peking
set
up
their
administration
in
urga
and
other
mongol
towns
actually
removed
his
holiness
bogdo
khan
from
the
affairs
of
administration
made
him
only
a
machine
for
signing
chinese
decrees
and
at
last
introduced
into
mongolia
their
troops
from
that
moment
there
developed
an
energetic
flow
of
chinese
merchants
and
coolies
into
mongolia
the
chinese
began
to
demand
the
payment
of
taxes
and
dues
from
the
mongolian
population
were
rapidly
stripped
of
their
wealth
and
now
in
the
vicinities
of
our
towns
and
monasteries
you
can
see
whole
settlements
of
beggar
mongols
living
in
dugouts
all
our
mongol
arsenals
and
treasuries
were
requisitioned
all
monasteries
were
forced
to
pay
taxes
all
mongols
working
for
the
liberty
of
their
country
were
persecuted
through
bribery
with
chinese
silver
orders
and
titles
the
chinese
secured
a
following
among
the
poorer
mongol
princes
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
the
governing
class
his
holiness
khans
princes
and
high
lamas
as
well
as
the
ruined
and
oppressed
people
remembering
that
the
mongol
rulers
had
once
held
peking
and
china
in
their
hands
and
under
their
reign
had
given
her
the
first
place
in
asia
were
definitely
hostile
to
the
chinese
administrators
acting
thus
insurrection
was
however
impossible
we
had
no
arms
all
our
leaders
were
under
surveillance
and
every
movement
by
them
toward
an
armed
resistance
would
have
ended
in
the
same
prison
at
peking
where
eighty
of
our
nobles
princes
and
lamas
died
from
hunger
and
torture
after
a
previous
struggle
for
the
liberty
of
mongolia
some
abnormally
strong
shock
was
necessary
to
drive
the
people
into
action
this
was
given
by
the
chinese
administrators
general
cheng
yi
and
general
chu
they
announced
that
his
holiness
bogdo
khan
was
under
arrest
in
his
own
palace
and
they
recalled
to
his
attention
the
former
decree
of
the
peking
government
held
by
the
mongols
to
be
unwarranted
and
illegal
that
his
holiness
was
the
last
living
buddha
this
was
enough
immediately
secret
relations
were
made
between
the
people
and
their
living
god
and
plans
were
at
once
elaborated
for
the
liberation
of
his
holiness
and
for
the
struggle
for
liberty
and
freedom
of
our
people
we
were
helped
by
the
great
prince
of
the
buriats
djam
bolon
who
began
parleys
with
general
ungern
then
engaged
in
fighting
the
bolsheviki
in
transbaikalia
and
invited
him
to
enter
mongolia
and
help
in
the
war
against
the
chinese
then
our
struggle
for
liberty
thus
the
sait
of
uliassutai
explained
the
situation
to
me
afterwards
i
heard
that
baron
ungern
who
had
agreed
to
fight
for
the
liberty
of
mongolia
directed
that
the
mobilization
of
the
mongolians
in
the
northern
districts
be
forwarded
at
once
and
promised
to
enter
mongolia
with
his
own
small
detachment
moving
along
the
river
kerulen
afterwards
he
took
up
relations
with
the
other
russian
detachment
of
colonel
kazagrandi
and
together
with
the
mobilized
mongolian
riders
began
the
attack
on
urga
twice
he
was
defeated
but
on
the
third
of
february
he
succeeded
in
capturing
the
town
and
replaced
the
living
buddha
on
the
throne
of
the
khans
at
the
end
of
march
however
these
events
were
still
unknown
in
uliassutai
we
knew
neither
of
the
fall
of
urga
nor
of
the
destruction
of
the
chinese
army
of
nearly
in
the
battles
of
maimachen
on
the
shore
of
the
tola
and
on
the
roads
between
urga
and
ude
the
chinese
carefully
concealed
the
truth
by
preventing
anybody
from
passing
westward
from
urga
however
rumours
existed
and
troubled
all
the
atmosphere
became
more
and
more
tense
while
the
relations
between
the
chinese
on
the
one
side
and
the
mongolians
and
russians
on
the
other
became
more
and
more
strained
at
this
time
the
chinese
commissioner
in
uliassutai
was
wang
and
his
advisor
fu
hsiang
both
very
young
and
inexperienced
men
the
chinese
authorities
had
dismissed
the
uliassutai
sait
the
prominent
mongolian
patriot
prince
chultun
beyle
and
had
appointed
a
lama
prince
friendly
to
china
the
former
of
war
in
urga
oppression
increased
the
searching
of
russian
officers
and
colonists
houses
and
quarters
commenced
open
relations
with
the
bolsheviki
followed
and
arrest
and
beatings
became
common
the
russian
officers
formed
a
secret
detachment
of
sixty
men
so
that
they
could
defend
themselves
however
in
this
detachment
disagreements
soon
sprang
up
between
michailoff
and
some
of
his
officers
it
was
evident
that
in
the
decisive
moment
the
detachment
must
separate
into
factions
we
foreigners
in
council
decided
to
make
a
thorough
reconnaissance
in
order
to
know
whether
there
was
danger
of
red
troops
arriving
my
old
companion
and
i
agreed
to
do
this
scouting
prince
chultun
beyle
gave
us
a
very
good
guide
an
old
mongol
named
tzeren
who
spoke
and
read
russian
perfectly
he
was
a
very
interesting
personage
holding
the
position
of
interpreter
with
the
mongolian
authorities
and
sometimes
with
the
chinese
commissioner
shortly
before
he
had
been
sent
as
a
special
envoy
to
peking
with
very
important
despatches
and
this
incomparable
horseman
had
made
the
journey
between
uliassutai
and
peking
that
is
miles
in
nine
days
incredible
as
it
may
seem
he
prepared
himself
for
the
journey
by
binding
all
his
abdomen
and
chest
legs
arms
and
neck
with
strong
cotton
bandages
to
protect
himself
from
the
wracks
and
strains
of
such
a
period
in
the
saddle
in
his
cap
he
bore
three
eagle
feathers
as
a
token
that
he
had
received
orders
to
fly
like
a
bird
armed
with
a
special
document
called
a
tzara
which
gave
him
the
right
to
receive
at
all
post
stations
the
best
horses
one
to
ride
and
one
fully
saddled
to
lead
as
a
change
together
with
two
oulatchen
or
guards
to
accompany
him
and
bring
back
the
horses
from
the
next
station
or
ourton
he
made
the
distance
of
from
fifteen
to
thirty
miles
between
stations
at
full
gallop
stopping
only
long
enough
to
have
the
horses
and
guards
changed
before
he
was
off
again
ahead
of
him
rode
one
oulatchen
with
the
best
horses
to
enable
him
to
announce
and
prepare
in
advance
the
complement
of
steeds
at
the
next
station
each
oulatchen
had
three
horses
in
all
so
that
he
could
swing
from
one
that
had
given
out
and
release
him
to
graze
until
his
return
to
pick
him
up
and
lead
or
ride
him
back
home
at
every
third
ourton
without
leaving
his
saddle
he
received
a
cup
of
hot
green
tea
with
salt
and
continued
his
race
southward
after
seventeen
or
eighteen
hours
of
such
riding
he
stopped
at
the
ourton
for
the
night
or
what
was
left
of
it
devoured
a
leg
of
boiled
mutton
and
slept
thus
he
ate
once
a
day
and
five
times
a
day
had
tea
and
so
he
traveled
for
nine
days
with
this
servant
we
moved
out
one
cold
winter
morning
in
the
direction
of
kobdo
just
over
three
hundred
miles
because
from
there
we
had
received
the
disquieting
rumours
that
the
red
troops
had
entered
ulankom
and
that
the
chinese
authorities
had
handed
over
to
them
all
the
europeans
in
the
town
we
crossed
the
river
dzaphin
on
the
ice
it
is
a
terrible
stream
its
bed
is
full
of
quicksands
which
in
summer
suck
in
numbers
of
camels
horses
and
men
we
entered
a
long
winding
valley
among
the
mountains
covered
with
deep
snow
and
here
and
there
with
groves
of
the
black
wood
of
the
larch
about
halfway
to
kobdo
we
came
across
the
yurta
of
a
shepherd
on
the
shore
of
the
small
lake
of
baga
nor
where
evening
and
a
strong
wind
whirling
gusts
of
snow
in
our
faces
easily
persuaded
us
to
stop
by
the
yurta
stood
a
splendid
bay
horse
with
a
saddle
richly
ornamerited
with
silver
and
coral
as
we
turned
in
from
the
road
two
mongols
left
the
yurta
very
hastily
one
of
them
jumped
into
the
saddle
and
quickly
disappeared
in
the
plain
behind
the
snowy
hillocks
we
clearly
made
out
the
flashing
folds
of
his
yellow
robe
under
the
great
outer
coat
and
saw
his
large
knife
sheathed
in
a
green
leather
scabbard
and
handled
with
horn
and
ivory
the
other
man
was
the
host
of
the
yurta
the
shepherd
of
a
local
prince
novontziran
he
gave
signs
of
great
pleasure
at
seeing
us
and
receiving
us
in
his
yurta
who
was
the
rider
on
the
bay
horse
we
asked
he
dropped
his
eyes
and
was
silent
tell
us
we
insisted
if
you
do
not
wish
to
speak
his
name
it
means
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
bad
no
no
he
remonstrated
flourishing
his
hands
he
is
a
good
great
man
but
the
law
does
not
permit
me
to
speak
his
we
at
once
understood
that
the
man
was
either
the
chief
of
the
shepherd
or
some
high
lama
consequently
we
did
not
further
insist
and
began
making
our
sleeping
arrangements
our
host
set
three
legs
of
mutton
to
boil
for
us
skillfully
cutting
out
the
bones
with
his
heavy
knife
we
chatted
and
learned
that
no
one
had
seen
red
troops
around
this
region
but
in
kobdo
and
in
ulankom
the
chinese
soldiers
were
oppressing
the
population
and
were
beating
to
death
with
the
bamboo
mongol
men
who
were
defending
their
women
against
the
ravages
of
these
chinese
troops
some
of
the
mongols
had
retreated
to
the
mountains
to
join
detachments
under
the
command
of
kaigordoff
an
altai
tartar
officer
who
was
supplying
them
with
weapons
chapter
xviii
the
mysterious
lama
avenger
we
rested
soundly
in
the
yurta
after
the
two
days
of
travel
which
had
brought
us
one
hundred
seventy
miles
through
the
snow
and
sharp
cold
round
the
evening
meal
of
juicy
mutton
we
were
talking
freely
and
carelessly
when
suddenly
we
heard
a
low
hoarse
voice
sayn
good
evening
we
turned
around
from
the
brazier
to
the
door
and
saw
a
medium
height
very
heavy
set
mongol
in
deerskin
overcoat
and
cap
with
side
flaps
and
the
long
wide
tying
strings
of
the
same
material
under
his
girdle
lay
the
same
large
knife
in
the
green
sheath
which
we
had
seen
on
the
departing
horseman
amoursayn
we
answered
he
quickly
untied
his
girdle
and
laid
aside
his
overcoat
he
stood
before
us
in
a
wonderful
gown
of
silk
yellow
as
beaten
gold
and
girt
with
a
brilliant
blue
sash
his
cleanly
shaven
face
short
hair
red
coral
rosary
on
the
left
hand
and
his
yellow
garment
proved
clearly
that
before
us
stood
some
high
lama
priest
with
a
big
colt
under
his
blue
sash
i
turned
to
my
host
and
tzeren
and
read
in
their
faces
fear
and
veneration
the
stranger
came
over
to
the
brazier
and
sat
down
let
s
speak
russian
he
said
and
took
a
bit
of
meat
the
conversation
began
the
stranger
began
to
find
fault
with
the
government
of
the
living
buddha
in
urga
there
they
liberate
mongolia
capture
urga
defeat
the
chinese
army
and
here
in
the
west
they
give
us
no
news
of
it
we
are
without
action
here
while
the
chinese
kill
our
people
and
steal
from
them
i
think
that
bogdo
khan
might
send
us
envoys
how
is
it
the
chinese
can
send
their
envoys
from
urga
and
kiakhta
to
kobdo
asking
for
assistance
and
the
mongol
government
can
not
do
it
why
will
the
chinese
send
help
to
urga
i
asked
our
guest
laughed
hoarsely
and
said
i
caught
all
the
envoys
took
away
their
letters
and
then
sent
them
back
into
the
he
laughed
again
and
glanced
around
peculiarly
with
his
blazing
eyes
only
then
did
i
notice
that
his
cheekbones
and
eyes
had
lines
strange
to
the
mongols
of
central
asia
he
looked
more
like
a
tartar
or
a
kirghiz
we
were
silent
and
smoked
our
pipes
how
soon
will
the
detachment
of
chahars
leave
uliassutai
he
asked
we
answered
that
we
had
not
heard
about
them
our
guest
explained
that
from
inner
mongolia
the
chinese
authorities
had
sent
out
a
strong
detachment
mobilized
from
among
the
most
warlike
tribe
of
chahars
which
wander
about
the
region
just
outside
the
great
wall
its
chief
was
a
notorious
hunghutze
leader
promoted
by
the
chinese
government
to
the
rank
of
captain
on
promising
that
he
would
bring
under
subjugation
to
the
chinese
authorities
all
the
tribes
of
the
districts
of
kobdo
and
urianhai
when
he
learned
whither
we
were
going
and
for
what
purpose
he
said
he
could
give
us
the
most
accurate
news
and
relieve
us
from
the
necessity
of
going
farther
besides
that
it
is
very
dangerous
he
said
because
kobdo
will
be
massacred
and
burned
i
know
this
when
he
heard
of
our
unsuccessful
attempt
to
pass
through
tibet
he
became
attentive
and
very
sympathetic
in
his
bearing
toward
us
and
with
evident
feeling
of
regret
expressed
himself
strongly
only
i
could
have
helped
you
in
this
enterprise
but
not
the
narabanchi
hutuktu
with
my
you
could
have
gone
anywhere
in
tibet
i
am
tushegoun
tushegoun
lama
how
many
extraordinary
tales
i
had
heard
about
him
he
is
a
russian
kalmuck
who
because
of
his
propaganda
work
for
the
independence
of
the
kalmuck
people
made
the
acquaintance
of
many
russian
prisons
under
the
czar
and
for
the
same
cause
added
to
his
list
under
the
bolsheviki
he
escaped
to
mongolia
and
at
once
attained
to
great
influence
among
the
mongols
it
was
no
wonder
for
he
was
a
close
friend
and
pupil
of
the
dalai
lama
in
potala
lhasa
was
the
most
learned
among
the
lamites
a
famous
thaumaturgist
and
doctor
he
occupied
an
almost
independent
position
in
his
relationship
with
the
living
buddha
and
achieved
to
the
leadership
of
all
the
old
wandering
tribes
of
western
mongolia
and
zungaria
even
extending
his
political
domination
over
the
mongolian
tribes
of
turkestan
his
influence
was
irresistible
based
as
it
was
on
his
great
control
of
mysterious
science
as
he
expressed
it
but
i
was
also
told
that
it
has
its
foundation
largely
in
the
panicky
fear
which
he
could
produce
in
the
mongols
everyone
who
disobeyed
his
orders
perished
such
an
one
never
knew
the
day
or
the
hour
when
in
his
yurta
or
beside
his
galloping
horse
on
the
plains
the
strange
and
powerful
friend
of
the
dalai
lama
would
appear
the
stroke
of
a
knife
a
bullet
or
strong
fingers
strangling
the
neck
like
a
vise
accomplished
the
justice
of
the
plans
of
this
miracle
worker
without
the
walls
of
the
yurta
the
wind
whistled
and
roared
and
drove
the
frozen
snow
sharply
against
the
stretched
felt
through
the
roar
of
the
wind
came
the
sound
of
many
voices
in
mingled
shouting
wailing
and
laughter
i
felt
that
in
such
surroundings
it
were
not
difficult
to
dumbfound
a
wandering
nomad
with
miracles
because
nature
herself
had
prepared
the
setting
for
it
this
thought
had
scarcely
time
to
flash
through
my
mind
before
tushegoun
lama
suddenly
raised
his
head
looked
sharply
at
me
and
said
there
is
very
much
unknown
in
nature
and
the
skill
of
using
the
unknown
produces
the
miracle
but
the
power
is
given
to
few
i
want
to
prove
it
to
you
and
you
may
tell
me
afterwards
whether
you
have
seen
it
before
or
he
stood
up
pushed
back
the
sleeves
of
his
yellow
garment
seized
his
knife
and
strode
across
to
the
shepherd
michik
stand
up
he
ordered
when
the
shepherd
had
risen
the
lama
quickly
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
bared
the
man
s
chest
i
could
not
yet
understand
what
was
his
intention
when
suddenly
the
tushegoun
with
all
his
force
struck
his
knife
into
the
chest
of
the
shepherd
the
mongol
fell
all
covered
with
blood
a
splash
of
which
i
noticed
on
the
yellow
silk
of
the
lama
s
coat
what
have
you
done
i
exclaimed
sh
be
still
he
whispered
turning
to
me
his
now
quite
blanched
face
with
a
few
strokes
of
the
knife
he
opened
the
chest
of
the
mongol
and
i
saw
the
man
s
lungs
softly
breathing
and
the
distinct
palpitations
of
the
heart
the
lama
touched
these
organs
with
his
fingers
but
no
more
blood
appeared
to
flow
and
the
face
of
the
shepherd
was
quite
calm
he
was
lying
with
his
eyes
closed
and
appeared
to
be
in
deep
and
quiet
sleep
as
the
lama
began
to
open
his
abdomen
i
shut
my
eyes
in
fear
and
horror
and
when
i
opened
them
a
little
while
later
i
was
still
more
dumbfounded
at
seeing
the
shepherd
with
his
coat
still
open
and
his
breast
normal
quietly
sleeping
on
his
side
and
tushegoun
lama
sitting
peacefully
by
the
brazier
smoking
his
pipe
and
looking
into
the
fire
in
deep
thought
it
is
wonderful
i
confessed
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
about
what
are
you
speaking
asked
the
kalmuck
about
your
demonstration
or
miracle
as
you
call
it
i
answered
i
never
said
anything
like
that
refuted
the
kalmuck
with
coldness
in
his
voice
did
you
see
it
i
asked
of
my
companion
what
he
queried
in
a
dozing
voice
i
realized
that
i
had
become
the
victim
of
the
hypnotic
power
of
tushegoun
lama
but
i
preferred
this
to
seeing
an
innocent
mongolian
die
for
i
had
not
believed
that
tushegoun
lama
after
slashing
open
the
bodies
of
his
victims
could
repair
them
again
so
readily
the
following
day
we
took
leave
of
our
hosts
we
decided
to
return
inasmuch
as
our
mission
was
accomplished
and
tushegoun
lama
explained
to
us
that
he
would
move
through
he
wandered
over
all
mongolia
lived
both
in
the
single
simple
yurta
of
the
shepherd
and
hunter
and
in
the
splendid
tents
of
the
princes
and
tribal
chiefs
surrounded
by
deep
veneration
and
enticing
and
cementing
to
him
rich
and
poor
alike
with
his
miracles
and
prophecies
when
bidding
us
adieu
the
kalmuck
sorcerer
slyly
smiled
and
said
do
not
give
any
information
about
me
to
the
chinese
afterwards
he
added
what
happened
to
you
yesterday
evening
was
a
futile
demonstration
you
europeans
will
not
recognize
that
we
nomads
possess
the
powers
of
mysterious
science
if
you
could
only
see
the
miracles
and
power
of
the
most
holy
tashi
lama
when
at
his
command
the
lamps
and
candles
before
the
ancient
statue
of
buddha
light
themselves
and
when
the
ikons
of
the
gods
begin
to
speak
and
prophesy
but
there
exists
a
more
powerful
and
more
holy
man
is
it
the
king
of
the
world
in
agharti
i
interrupted
he
stared
and
glanced
at
me
in
amazement
have
you
heard
about
him
he
asked
as
his
brows
knit
in
thought
after
a
few
seconds
he
raised
his
narrow
eyes
and
said
only
one
man
knows
his
holy
name
only
one
man
now
living
was
ever
in
agharti
that
is
i
this
is
the
reason
why
the
most
holy
dalai
lama
has
honored
me
and
why
the
living
buddha
in
urga
fears
me
but
in
vain
for
i
shall
never
sit
on
the
holy
throne
of
the
highest
priest
in
lhasa
nor
reach
that
which
has
come
down
from
jenghiz
khan
to
the
head
of
our
yellow
faith
i
am
no
monk
i
am
a
warrior
and
he
jumped
smartly
into
the
saddle
whipped
his
horse
and
whirled
away
flinging
out
as
he
left
the
common
mongolian
phrase
of
adieu
sayn
on
the
way
back
tzeren
related
to
us
the
hundreds
of
legends
surrounding
tushegoun
lama
one
tale
especially
remained
in
my
mind
it
was
in
or
when
the
mongols
by
armed
force
tried
to
attain
their
liberty
in
a
struggle
with
the
chinese
the
general
chinese
headquarters
in
western
mongolia
was
kobdo
where
they
had
about
ten
thousand
soldiers
under
the
command
of
their
best
officers
the
command
to
capture
kobdo
was
sent
to
hun
baldon
a
simple
shepherd
who
had
distinguished
himself
in
fights
with
the
chinese
and
received
from
the
living
buddha
the
title
of
prince
of
hun
ferocious
absolutely
without
fear
and
possessing
gigantic
strength
baldon
had
several
times
led
to
the
attack
his
poorly
armed
mongols
but
each
time
had
been
forced
to
retreat
after
losing
many
of
his
men
under
the
fire
unexpectedly
tushegoun
lama
arrived
he
collected
all
the
soldiers
and
then
said
to
them
you
must
not
fear
death
and
must
not
retreat
you
are
fighting
and
dying
for
mongolia
for
which
the
gods
have
appointed
a
great
destiny
see
what
the
fate
of
mongolia
will
be
he
made
a
great
sweeping
gesture
with
his
hand
and
all
the
soldiers
saw
the
country
round
about
set
with
rich
yurtas
and
pastures
covered
with
great
herds
of
horses
and
cattle
on
the
plains
appeared
numerous
horsemen
on
richly
saddled
steeds
the
women
were
gowned
in
the
finest
of
silk
with
massive
silver
rings
in
their
ears
and
precious
ornaments
in
their
elaborate
head
dresses
chinese
merchants
led
an
endless
caravan
of
merchandise
up
to
distinguished
looking
mongol
saits
surrounded
by
the
gaily
dressed
tzirik
or
soldiers
and
proudly
negotiating
with
the
merchants
for
their
wares
shortly
the
vision
disappeared
and
tushegoun
began
to
speak
do
not
fear
death
it
is
a
release
from
our
labor
on
earth
and
the
path
to
the
state
of
constant
blessings
look
to
the
east
do
you
see
your
brothers
and
friends
who
have
fallen
in
battle
we
see
we
see
the
mongol
warriors
exclaimed
in
astonishment
as
they
all
looked
upon
a
great
group
of
dwellings
which
might
have
been
yurtas
or
the
arches
of
temples
flushed
with
a
warm
and
kindly
light
red
and
yellow
silk
were
interwoven
in
bright
bands
that
covered
the
walls
and
floor
everywhere
the
gilding
on
pillars
and
walls
gleamed
brightly
on
the
great
red
altar
burned
the
thin
sacrificial
candles
in
gold
candelabra
beside
the
massive
silver
vessels
filled
with
milk
and
nuts
on
soft
pillows
about
the
floor
sat
the
mongols
who
had
fallen
in
the
previous
attack
on
kobdo
before
them
stood
low
lacquered
tables
laden
with
many
dishes
of
steaming
succulent
flesh
of
the
lamb
and
the
kid
with
high
jugs
of
wine
and
tea
with
plates
of
borsuk

kind
of
sweet
rich
cakes
with
aromatic
zatouran
covered
with
sheep

fat
with
bricks
of
dried
cheese
with
dates
raisins
and
nuts
these
fallen
soldiers
smoked
golden
pipes
and
chatted
gaily
this
vision
in
turn
also
disappeared
and
before
the
gazing
mongols
stood
only
the
mysterious
kalmuck
with
his
hand
upraised
to
battle
and
return
not
without
victory

am
with
you

the
mongols
fought
furiously
perished
by
the
hundreds
but
not
before
they
had
rushed
into

was
the
long

of

came
to

and
also
destroyed
the

the
ruins

chapter
xix
wild
chahars
after
our
return
to
uliassutai
we
heard
that
disquieting
news
had
been
received
by
the
mongol
sait
from
muren
kure
the
letter
stated
that
red
troops
were
pressing
colonel
kazagrandi
very
hard
in
the
region
of
lake
kosogol
the
sait
feared
the
advance
of
the
red
troops
southward
to
uliassutai
both
the
american
firms
liquidated
their
affairs
and
all
our
friends
were
prepared
for
a
quick
exit
though
they
hesitated
at
the
thought
of
leaving
the
town
as
they
were
afraid
of
meeting
the
detachment
of
chahars
sent
from
the
east
we
decided
to
await
the
arrival
of
this
detachment
as
their
coming
could
change
the
whole
course
of
events
in
a
few
days
they
came
two
hundred
warlike
chahar
brigands
under
the
command
of
a
former
chinese
hunghutze
he
was
a
tall
skinny
man
with
hands
that
reached
almost
to
his
knees
a
face
blackened
by
wind
and
sun
and
mutilated
with
two
long
scars
down
over
his
forehead
and
cheek
the
making
of
one
of
which
had
also
closed
one
of
his
hawklike
eyes
topped
off
with
a
shaggy
coonskin
cap
such
was
the
commander
of
the
detachment
of
chahars
a
personage
very
dark
and
stern
with
whom
a
night
meeting
on
a
lonely
street
could
not
be
considered
a
pleasure
by
any
bent
of
the
imagination
the
detachment
made
camp
within
the
destroyed
fortress
near
to
the
single
chinese
building
that
had
not
been
razed
and
which
was
now
serving
as
headquarters
for
the
chinese
commissioner
on
the
very
day
of
their
arrival
the
chahars
pillaged
a
chinese
dugun
or
trading
house
not
half
a
mile
from
the
fortress
and
also
offended
the
wife
of
the
chinese
commissioner
by
calling
her
a
the
chahars
like
the
mongols
were
quite
right
in
their
stand
because
the
chinese
commissioner
wang
had
on
his
arrival
in
uliassutai
followed
the
chinese
custom
of
demanding
a
mongolian
wife
the
servile
new
sait
had
given
orders
that
a
beautiful
and
suitable
mongolian
girl
be
found
for
him
one
was
so
run
down
and
placed
in
his
yamen
together
with
her
big
wrestling
mongol
brother
who
was
to
be
a
guard
for
the
commissioner
but
who
developed
into
the
nurse
for
the
little
white
pekingese
pug
which
the
official
presented
to
his
new
wife
burglaries
squabbles
and
drunken
orgies
of
the
chahars
followed
so
that
wang
exerted
all
his
efforts
to
hurry
the
detachment
westward
to
kobdo
and
farther
into
urianhai
one
cold
morning
the
inhabitants
of
uliassutai
rose
to
witness
a
very
stern
picture
along
the
main
street
of
the
town
the
detachment
was
passing
they
were
riding
on
small
shaggy
ponies
three
abreast
were
dressed
in
warm
blue
coats
with
sheepskin
overcoats
outside
and
crowned
with
the
regulation
coonskin
caps
armed
from
head
to
foot
they
rode
with
wild
shouts
and
cheers
very
greedily
eyeing
the
chinese
shops
and
the
houses
of
the
russian
colonists
at
their
head
rode
the
hunghutze
chief
with
three
horsemen
behind
him
in
white
overcoats
who
carried
waving
banners
and
blew
what
may
have
been
meant
for
music
through
great
conch
shells
one
of
the
chahars
could
not
resist
and
so
jumped
out
of
his
saddle
and
made
for
a
chinese
shop
along
the
street
immediately
the
anxious
cries
of
the
chinese
merchants
came
from
the
shop
the
hunghutze
swung
round
noticed
the
horse
at
the
door
of
the
shop
and
realized
what
was
happening
immediately
he
reined
his
horse
and
made
for
the
spot
with
his
raucous
voice
he
called
the
chahar
out
as
he
came
he
struck
him
full
in
the
face
with
his
whip
and
with
all
his
strength
blood
flowed
from
the
slashed
cheek
but
the
chahar
was
in
the
saddle
in
a
second
without
a
murmur
and
galloped
to
his
place
in
the
file
during
this
exit
of
the
chahars
all
the
people
were
hidden
in
their
houses
anxiously
peeping
through
cracks
and
corners
of
the
windows
but
the
chahars
passed
peacefully
out
and
only
when
they
met
a
caravan
carrying
chinese
wine
about
six
miles
from
town
did
their
native
tendency
display
itself
again
in
pillaging
and
emptying
several
containers
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
hargana
they
were
ambushed
by
tushegoun
lama
and
so
treated
that
never
again
will
the
plains
of
chahar
welcome
the
return
of
these
warrior
sons
who
were
sent
out
to
conquer
the
soyot
descendants
of
the
ancient
tuba
the
day
the
column
left
uliassutai
a
heavy
snow
fell
so
that
the
road
became
impassable
the
horses
first
were
up
to
their
knees
tired
out
and
stopped
some
mongol
horsemen
reached
uliassutai
the
following
day
after
great
hardship
and
exertion
having
made
only
miles
in
hours
caravans
were
compelled
to
stop
along
the
routes
the
mongols
would
not
consent
even
to
attempt
journeys
with
oxen
and
yaks
which
made
but
ten
or
twelve
miles
a
day
only
camels
could
be
used
but
there
were
too
few
and
their
drivers
did
not
feel
that
they
could
make
the
first
railway
station
of
which
was
about
fourteen
hundred
miles
away
we
were
forced
again
to
wait
for
which
death
or
salvation
only
our
own
energy
and
force
could
save
us
consequently
my
friend
and
i
started
out
supplied
with
a
tent
stove
and
food
for
a
new
reconnaissance
along
the
shore
of
lake
kosogol
whence
the
mongol
sait
expected
the
new
invasion
of
red
troops
chapter
xx
the
demon
of
jagisstai
our
small
group
consisting
of
four
mounted
and
one
pack
camel
moved
northward
along
the
valley
of
the
river
boyagol
in
the
direction
of
the
tarbagatai
mountains
the
road
was
rocky
and
covered
deep
with
snow
our
camels
walked
very
carefully
sniffing
out
the
way
as
our
guide
shouted
the
ok
ok
of
the
camel
drivers
to
urge
them
on
we
left
behind
us
the
fortress
and
chinese
dugun
swung
round
the
shoulder
of
a
ridge
and
after
fording
several
times
an
open
stream
began
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
the
scramble
was
hard
and
dangerous
our
camels
picked
their
way
most
cautiously
moving
their
ears
constantly
as
is
their
habit
in
such
stress
the
trail
zigzagged
into
mountain
ravines
passed
over
the
tops
of
ridges
slipped
back
down
again
into
shallower
valleys
but
ever
made
higher
and
higher
altitudes
at
one
place
under
the
grey
clouds
that
tipped
the
ridges
we
saw
away
up
on
the
wide
expanse
of
snow
some
black
spots
those
are
the
obo
the
sacred
signs
and
altars
for
the
bad
demons
watching
this
pass
explained
the
guide
this
pass
is
called
jagisstai
many
very
old
tales
about
it
have
been
kept
alive
ancient
as
these
mountains
we
encouraged
him
to
tell
us
some
of
them
the
mongol
rocking
on
his
camel
and
looking
carefully
all
around
him
began
his
tale
it
was
long
ago
very
long
ago
the
grandson
of
the
great
jenghiz
khan
sat
on
the
throne
of
china
and
ruled
all
asia
the
chinese
killed
their
khan
and
wanted
to
exterminate
all
his
family
but
a
holy
old
lama
slipped
the
wife
and
little
son
out
of
the
palace
and
carried
them
off
on
swift
camels
beyond
the
great
wall
where
they
sank
into
our
native
plains
the
chinese
made
a
long
search
for
the
trails
of
our
refugees
and
at
last
found
where
they
had
gone
they
despatched
a
strong
detachment
on
fleet
horses
to
capture
them
sometimes
the
chinese
nearly
came
up
with
the
fleeing
heir
of
our
khan
but
the
lama
called
down
from
heaven
a
deep
snow
through
which
the
camels
could
pass
while
the
horses
were
inextricably
held
this
lama
was
from
a
distant
monastery
we
shall
pass
this
hospice
of
jahantsi
kure
in
order
to
reach
it
one
must
cross
over
the
jagisstai
and
it
was
just
here
the
old
lama
suddenly
became
ill
rocked
in
his
saddle
and
fell
dead
ta
sin
lo
the
widow
of
the
great
khan
burst
into
tears
but
seeing
the
chinese
riders
galloping
there
below
across
the
valley
pressed
on
toward
the
pass
the
camels
were
tired
stopping
every
moment
nor
did
the
woman
know
how
to
stimulate
and
drive
them
on
the
chinese
riders
came
nearer
and
nearer
already
she
heard
their
shouts
of
joy
as
they
felt
within
their
grasp
the
prize
of
the
mandarins
for
the
murder
of
the
heir
of
the
great
khan
the
heads
of
the
mother
and
the
son
would
be
brought
to
peking
and
exposed
on
the
ch
ien
men
for
the
mockery
and
insults
of
the
people
the
frightened
mother
lifted
her
little
son
toward
heaven
and
exclaimed
earth
and
gods
of
mongolia
behold
the
offspring
of
the
man
who
has
glorified
the
name
of
the
mongols
from
one
end
of
the
world
to
the
other
allow
not
this
very
flesh
of
jenghiz
khan
to
perish
at
this
moment
she
noticed
a
white
mouse
sitting
on
a
rock
nearby
it
jumped
to
her
knees
and
said
i
am
sent
to
help
you
go
on
calmly
and
do
not
fear
the
pursuers
of
you
and
your
son
to
whom
is
destined
a
life
of
glory
have
come
to
the
last
bourne
of
their
ta
sin
lo
did
not
see
how
one
small
mouse
could
hold
in
check
three
hundred
men
the
mouse
jumped
back
to
the
ground
and
again
spoke
i
am
the
demon
of
tarbagatai
jagasstai
i
am
mighty
and
beloved
of
the
gods
but
because
you
doubted
the
powers
of
the
mouse
from
this
day
the
jagasstai
will
be
dangerous
for
the
good
and
bad
the
khan
s
widow
and
son
were
saved
but
jagasstai
has
ever
remained
merciless
during
the
journey
over
this
pass
one
must
always
be
on
one
s
guard
the
demon
of
the
mountain
is
ever
ready
to
lead
the
traveler
to
all
the
tops
of
the
ridges
of
the
tarbagatai
are
thickly
dotted
with
the
obo
of
rocks
and
branches
in
one
place
there
was
even
erected
a
tower
of
stones
as
an
altar
to
propitiate
the
gods
for
the
doubts
of
ta
sin
lo
evidently
the
demon
expected
us
when
we
began
our
ascent
of
the
main
ridge
he
blew
into
our
faces
with
a
sharp
cold
wind
whistled
and
roared
and
afterwards
began
casting
over
us
whole
blocks
of
snow
torn
off
the
drifts
above
we
could
not
distinguish
anything
around
us
scarcely
seeing
the
camel
immediately
in
front
suddenly
i
felt
a
shock
and
looked
about
me
nothing
unusual
was
visible
i
was
seated
comfortably
between
two
leather
saddle
bags
filled
with
meat
and
bread
but
i
could
not
see
the
head
of
my
camel
he
had
disappeared
it
seemed
that
he
had
slipped
and
fallen
to
the
bottom
of
a
shallow
ravine
while
the
bags
which
were
slung
across
his
back
without
straps
had
caught
on
a
rock
and
stopped
with
myself
there
in
the
snow
this
time
the
demon
of
jagasstai
only
played
a
joke
but
one
that
did
not
satisfy
him
he
began
to
show
more
and
more
anger
with
furious
gusts
of
wind
he
almost
dragged
us
and
our
bags
from
the
camels
and
nearly
knocked
over
our
humped
steeds
blinded
us
with
frozen
snow
and
prevented
us
from
breathing
through
long
hours
we
dragged
slowly
on
in
the
deep
snow
often
falling
over
the
edge
of
the
rocks
at
last
we
entered
a
small
valley
where
the
wind
whistled
and
roared
with
a
thousand
voices
it
had
grown
dark
the
mongol
wandered
around
searching
for
the
trail
and
finally
came
back
to
us
flourishing
his
arms
and
saying
we
have
lost
the
road
we
must
spend
the
night
here
it
is
very
bad
because
we
shall
have
no
wood
for
our
stove
and
the
cold
will
grow
with
great
difficulties
and
with
frozen
hands
we
managed
to
set
up
our
tent
in
the
wind
placing
in
it
the
now
useless
stove
we
covered
the
tent
with
snow
dug
deep
long
ditches
in
the
drifts
and
forced
our
camels
to
lie
down
in
them
by
shouting
the
dzuk
dzuk
command
to
kneel
then
we
brought
our
packs
into
the
tent
my
companion
rebelled
against
the
thought
of
spending
a
cold
night
with
a
stove
hard
by
i
am
going
out
to
look
for
firewood
said
he
very
decisively
and
at
that
took
up
the
ax
and
started
he
returned
after
an
hour
with
a
big
section
of
a
telegraph
pole
you
jenghiz
khans
said
he
rubbing
his
frozen
hands
take
your
axes
and
go
up
there
to
the
left
on
the
mountain
and
you
will
find
the
telegraph
poles
that
have
been
cut
down
i
made
acquaintance
with
the
old
jagasstai
and
he
showed
me
the
just
a
little
way
from
us
the
line
of
the
russian
telegraphs
passed
that
which
had
connected
irkutsk
with
uliassutai
before
the
days
of
the
bolsheviki
and
which
the
chinese
had
commanded
the
mongols
to
cut
down
and
take
the
wire
these
poles
are
now
the
salvation
of
travelers
crossing
the
pass
thus
we
spent
the
night
in
a
warm
tent
supped
well
from
hot
meat
soup
with
vermicelli
all
in
the
very
center
of
the
dominion
of
the
angered
jagasstai
early
the
next
morning
we
found
the
road
not
more
than
two
or
three
hundred
paces
from
our
tent
and
continued
our
hard
trip
over
the
ridge
of
tarbagatai
at
the
head
of
the
adair
river
valley
we
noticed
a
flock
of
the
mongolian
crows
with
carmine
beaks
circling
among
the
rocks
we
approached
the
place
and
discovered
the
recently
fallen
bodies
of
a
horse
and
rider
what
had
happened
to
them
was
difficult
to
guess
they
lay
close
together
the
bridle
was
wound
around
the
right
wrist
of
the
man
no
trace
of
knife
or
bullet
was
found
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
the
features
of
the
man
his
overcoat
was
mongolian
but
his
trousers
and
under
jacket
were
not
of
the
mongolian
pattern
we
asked
ourselves
what
had
happened
to
him
our
mongol
bowed
his
head
in
anxiety
and
said
in
hushed
but
assured
tones
it
is
the
vengeance
of
jagasstai
the
rider
did
not
make
sacrifice
at
the
southern
obo
and
the
demon
has
strangled
him
and
his
at
last
tarbagatai
was
behind
us
before
us
lay
the
valley
of
the
adair
it
was
a
narrow
zigzagging
plain
following
along
the
river
bed
between
close
mountain
ranges
and
covered
with
a
rich
grass
it
was
cut
into
two
parts
by
the
road
along
which
the
prostrate
telegraph
poles
now
lay
as
the
stumps
of
varying
heights
and
long
stretches
of
wire
completed
the
debris
this
destruction
of
the
telegraph
line
between
irkutsk
and
uliassutai
was
necessary
and
incident
to
the
aggressive
chinese
policy
in
mongolia
soon
we
began
to
meet
large
herds
of
sheep
which
were
digging
through
the
snow
to
the
dry
but
very
nutritious
grass
in
some
places
yaks
and
oxen
were
seen
on
the
high
slopes
of
the
mountains
only
once
however
did
we
see
a
shepherd
for
all
of
them
spying
us
first
had
made
off
to
the
mountains
or
hidden
in
the
ravines
we
did
not
even
discover
any
yurtas
along
the
way
the
mongols
had
also
concealed
all
their
movable
homes
in
the
folds
of
the
mountains
out
of
sight
and
away
from
the
reach
of
the
strong
winds
nomads
are
very
skilful
in
choosing
the
places
for
their
winter
dwellings
i
had
often
in
winter
visited
the
mongolian
yurtas
set
in
such
sheltered
places
that
as
i
came
off
the
windy
plains
i
felt
as
though
i
were
in
a
conservatory
once
we
came
up
to
a
big
herd
of
sheep
but
as
we
approached
most
of
the
herd
gradually
withdrew
leaving
one
part
that
remained
unmoved
as
the
other
worked
off
across
the
plains
from
this
section
soon
about
thirty
of
forty
head
emerged
and
went
scrambling
and
leaping
right
up
the
mountain
side
i
took
up
my
glasses
and
began
to
observe
them
the
part
of
the
herd
that
remained
behind
were
common
sheep
the
large
section
that
had
drawn
off
over
the
plain
were
mongolian
antelopes
gazella
gutturosa
while
the
few
that
had
taken
to
the
mountain
were
the
big
horned
sheep
ovis
argali
all
this
company
had
been
grazing
together
with
the
domestic
sheep
on
the
plains
of
the
adair
which
attracted
them
with
its
good
grass
and
clear
water
in
many
places
the
river
was
not
frozen
and
in
some
places
i
saw
great
clouds
of
steam
over
the
surface
of
the
open
water
in
the
meantime
some
of
the
antelopes
and
the
mountain
sheep
began
looking
at
us
now
they
will
soon
begin
to
cross
our
trail
laughed
the
mongol
very
funny
beasts
sometimes
the
antelopes
course
for
miles
in
their
endeavor
to
outrun
and
cross
in
front
of
our
horses
and
then
when
they
have
done
so
go
loping
quietly
i
had
already
seen
this
strategy
of
the
antelopes
and
i
decided
to
make
use
of
it
for
the
purpose
of
the
hunt
we
organized
our
chase
in
the
following
manner
we
let
one
mongol
with
the
pack
camel
proceed
as
we
had
been
traveling
and
the
other
three
of
us
spread
out
like
a
fan
headed
toward
the
herd
on
the
right
of
our
true
course
the
herd
stopped
and
looked
about
puzzled
for
their
etiquette
required
that
they
should
cross
the
path
of
all
four
of
these
riders
at
once
confusion
began
they
counted
about
three
thousand
heads
all
this
army
began
to
run
from
one
side
to
another
but
without
forming
any
distinct
groups
whole
squadrons
of
them
ran
before
us
and
then
noticing
another
rider
came
coursing
back
and
made
anew
the
same
manoeuvre
one
group
of
about
fifty
head
rushed
in
two
rows
toward
my
point
when
they
were
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
paces
away
i
shouted
and
fired
they
stopped
at
once
and
began
to
whirl
round
in
one
spot
running
into
one
another
and
even
jumping
over
one
another
their
panic
cost
them
dear
for
i
had
time
to
shoot
four
times
to
bring
down
two
beautiful
heads
my
friend
was
even
more
fortunate
than
i
for
he
shot
only
once
into
the
herd
as
it
rushed
past
him
in
parallel
lines
and
dropped
two
with
the
same
bullet
meanwhile
the
argali
had
gone
farther
up
the
mountainside
and
taken
stand
there
in
a
row
like
so
many
soldiers
turning
to
gaze
at
us
even
at
this
distance
i
could
clearly
distinguish
their
muscular
bodies
with
their
majestic
heads
and
stalwart
horns
picking
up
our
prey
we
overtook
the
mongol
who
had
gone
on
ahead
and
continued
our
way
in
many
places
we
came
across
the
carcasses
of
sheep
with
necks
torn
and
the
flesh
of
the
sides
eaten
off
it
is
the
work
of
wolves
said
the
mongol
they
are
always
hereabout
in
large
we
came
across
several
more
herds
of
antelope
which
ran
along
quietly
enough
until
they
had
made
a
comfortable
distance
ahead
of
us
and
then
with
tremendous
leaps
and
bounds
crossed
our
bows
like
the
proverbial
chicken
on
the
road
then
after
a
couple
of
hundred
paces
at
this
speed
they
stopped
and
began
to
graze
quite
calmly
once
i
turned
my
camel
back
and
the
whole
herd
immediately
took
up
the
challenge
again
coursed
along
parallel
with
me
until
they
had
made
sufficient
distance
for
their
ideas
of
safety
and
then
once
more
rushed
across
the
road
ahead
of
me
as
though
it
were
paved
with
red
hot
stones
only
to
assume
their
previous
calmness
and
graze
back
on
the
same
side
of
the
trail
from
which
our
column
had
first
started
them
on
another
occasion
i
did
this
three
times
with
a
particular
herd
and
laughed
long
and
heartily
at
their
stupid
customs
we
passed
a
very
unpleasant
night
in
this
valley
we
stopped
on
the
shore
of
the
frozen
stream
in
a
spot
where
we
found
shelter
from
the
wind
under
the
lee
of
a
high
shore
in
our
stove
we
did
have
a
fire
and
in
our
kettle
boiling
water
also
our
tent
was
warm
and
cozy
we
were
quietly
resting
with
pleasant
thoughts
of
supper
to
soothe
us
when
suddenly
a
howling
and
laughter
as
though
from
some
inferno
burst
upon
us
from
just
outside
the
tent
while
from
the
other
side
of
the
valley
came
the
long
and
doleful
howls
in
answer
wolves
calmly
explained
the
mongol
who
took
my
revolver
and
went
out
of
the
tent
he
did
not
return
for
some
time
but
at
last
we
heard
a
shot
and
shortly
after
he
entered
i
scared
them
a
little
said
he
they
had
congregated
on
the
shore
of
the
adair
around
the
body
of
a
and
they
have
not
touched
our
camels
we
asked
we
shall
make
a
bonfire
behind
our
tent
then
they
will
not
bother
after
our
supper
we
turned
in
but
i
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
listening
to
the
crackle
of
the
wood
in
the
fire
the
deep
sighing
breaths
of
the
camels
and
the
distant
howling
of
the
packs
of
wolves
but
finally
even
with
all
these
noises
fell
asleep
how
long
i
had
been
asleep
i
did
not
know
when
suddenly
i
was
awakened
by
a
strong
blow
in
the
side
i
was
lying
at
the
very
edge
of
the
tent
and
someone
from
outside
had
without
the
least
ceremony
pushed
strongly
against
me
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
camels
chewing
the
felt
of
the
tent
i
took
my
mauser
and
struck
the
wall
a
sharp
scream
was
followed
by
the
sound
of
quick
running
over
the
pebbles
in
the
morning
we
discovered
the
tracks
of
wolves
approaching
our
tent
from
the
side
opposite
to
the
fire
and
followed
them
to
where
they
had
begun
to
dig
under
the
tent
wall
but
evidently
one
of
the
robbers
was
forced
to
retreat
with
a
bruise
on
his
head
from
the
handle
of
the
mauser
wolves
and
eagles
are
the
servants
of
jagasstai
the
mongol
very
seriously
instructed
us
however
this
does
not
prevent
the
mongols
from
hunting
them
once
in
the
camp
of
prince
baysei
i
witnessed
such
a
hunt
the
mongol
horsemen
on
the
best
of
his
steeds
overtook
the
wolves
on
the
open
plain
and
killed
them
with
heavy
bamboo
sticks
or
tashur
a
russian
veterinary
surgeon
taught
the
mongols
to
poison
wolves
with
strychnine
but
the
mongols
soon
abandoned
this
method
because
of
its
danger
to
the
dogs
the
faithful
friends
and
allies
of
the
nomad
they
do
not
however
touch
the
eagles
and
hawks
but
even
feed
them
when
the
mongols
are
slaughtering
animals
they
often
cast
bits
of
meat
up
into
the
air
for
the
hawks
and
eagles
to
catch
in
flight
just
as
we
throw
a
bit
of
meat
to
a
dog
eagles
and
hawks
fight
and
drive
away
the
magpies
and
crows
which
are
very
dangerous
for
cattle
and
horses
because
they
scratch
and
peck
at
the
smallest
wound
or
abrasion
on
the
backs
of
the
animals
until
they
make
them
into
uncurable
areas
which
they
continue
to
harass
chapter

the
nest
of
death
our
camels
were
trudging
to
a
slow
but
steady
measure
on
toward
the
north
we
were
making
to
thirty
miles
a
day
as
we
approached
a
small
monastery
that
lay
to
the
left
of
our
route
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
square
of
large
buildings
surrounded
by
a
high
fence
of
thick
poles
each
side
had
an
opening
in
the
middle
leading
to
the
four
entrances
of
the
temple
in
the
center
of
the
square
the
temple
was
built
with
the
red
lacquered
columns
and
the
chinese
style
roofs
and
dominated
the
surrounding
low
dwellings
of
the
lamas
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
lay
what
appeared
to
be
a
chinese
fortress
but
which
was
in
reality
a
trading
compound
or
dugun
which
the
chinese
always
build
in
the
form
of
a
fortress
with
double
walls
a
few
feet
apart
within
which
they
place
their
houses
and
shops
and
usually
have
twenty
or
thirty
traders
fully
armed
for
any
emergency
in
case
of
need
these
duguns
can
be
used
as
blockhouses
and
are
capable
of
withstanding
long
sieges
between
the
dugun
and
the
monastery
and
nearer
to
the
road
i
made
out
the
camp
of
some
nomads
their
horses
and
cattle
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
evidently
the
mongols
had
stopped
here
for
some
time
and
had
left
their
cattle
in
the
mountains
over
several
yurtas
waved
triangular
flags
a
sign
of
the
presence
of
disease
near
some
yurtas
high
poles
were
stuck
into
the
ground
with
mongol
caps
at
their
tops
which
indicated
that
the
host
of
the
yurta
had
died
the
packs
of
dogs
wandering
over
the
plain
showed
that
the
dead
bodies
lay
somewhere
near
either
in
the
ravines
or
along
the
banks
of
the
river
as
we
approached
the
camp
we
heard
from
a
distance
the
frantic
beating
of
drums
the
mournful
sounds
of
the
flute
and
shrill
mad
shouting
our
mongol
went
forward
to
investigate
for
us
and
reported
that
several
mongolian
families
had
come
here
to
the
monastery
to
seek
aid
from
the
hutuktu
jahansti
who
was
famed
for
his
miracles
of
healing
the
people
were
stricken
with
leprosy
and
black
smallpox
and
had
come
from
long
distances
only
to
find
that
the
hutuktu
was
not
at
the
monastery
but
had
gone
to
the
living
buddha
in
urga
consequently
they
had
been
forced
to
invite
the
witch
doctors
the
people
were
dying
one
after
another
just
the
day
before
they
had
cast
on
the
plain
the
man
meanwhile
as
we
talked
the
witch
doctor
came
out
of
one
of
the
yurtas
he
was
an
old
man
with
a
cataract
on
one
eye
and
with
a
face
deeply
scarred
by
smallpox
he
was
dressed
in
tatters
with
various
colored
bits
of
cloth
hanging
down
from
his
waist
he
carried
a
drum
and
a
flute
we
could
see
froth
on
his
blue
lips
and
madness
in
his
eyes
suddenly
he
began
to
whirl
round
and
dance
with
a
thousand
prancings
of
his
long
legs
and
writhings
of
his
arms
and
shoulders
still
beating
the
drum
and
playing
the
flute
or
crying
and
raging
at
intervals
ever
accelerating
his
movements
until
at
last
with
pallid
face
and
bloodshot
eyes
he
fell
on
the
snow
where
he
continued
to
writhe
and
give
out
his
incoherent
cries
in
this
manner
the
doctor
treated
his
patients
frightening
with
his
madness
the
bad
devils
that
carry
disease
another
witch
doctor
gave
his
patients
dirty
muddy
water
which
i
learned
was
the
water
from
the
bath
of
the
very
person
of
the
living
buddha
who
had
washed
in
it
his
divine
body
born
from
the
sacred
flower
of
the
lotus
om
om
both
witches
continuously
screamed
while
the
doctors
fought
with
the
devils
the
ill
people
were
left
to
themselves
they
lay
in
high
fever
under
the
heaps
of
sheepskins
and
overcoats
were
delirious
raved
and
threw
themselves
about
by
the
braziers
squatted
adults
and
children
who
were
still
well
indifferently
chatting
drinking
tea
and
smoking
in
all
the
yurtas
i
saw
the
diseased
and
the
dead
and
such
misery
and
physical
horrors
as
can
not
be
described
and
i
thought
oh
great
jenghiz
khan
why
did
you
with
your
keen
understanding
of
the
whole
situation
of
asia
and
europe
you
who
devoted
all
your
life
to
the
glory
of
the
name
of
the
mongols
why
did
you
not
give
to
your
own
people
who
preserve
their
old
morality
honesty
and
peaceful
customs
the
enlightenment
that
would
have
saved
them
from
such
death
your
bones
in
the
mausoleum
at
karakorum
being
destroyed
by
the
centuries
that
pass
over
them
must
cry
out
against
the
rapid
disappearance
of
your
formerly
great
people
who
were
feared
by
half
the
civilized
world
such
thoughts
filled
my
brain
when
i
saw
this
camp
of
the
dead
tomorrow
and
when
i
heard
the
groans
shoutings
and
raving
of
dying
men
women
and
children
somewhere
in
the
distance
the
dogs
were
howling
mournfully
and
monotonously
the
drum
of
the
tired
witch
rolled
forward
i
could
not
witness
longer
this
dark
horror
which
i
had
no
means
or
force
to
eradicate
we
quickly
passed
on
from
the
ominous
place
nor
could
we
shake
the
thought
that
some
horrible
invisible
spirit
was
following
us
from
this
scene
of
terror
the
devils
of
disease
the
pictures
of
horror
and
misery
the
souls
of
men
who
have
been
sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
darkness
of
mongolia
an
inexplicable
fear
penetrated
into
our
consciousness
from
whose
grasp
we
could
not
release
ourselves
only
when
we
had
turned
from
the
road
passed
over
a
timbered
ridge
into
a
bowl
in
the
mountains
from
which
we
could
see
neither
jahantsi
kure
the
dugun
nor
the
squirming
grave
of
dying
mongols
could
we
breathe
freely
again
presently
we
discovered
a
large
lake
it
was
tisingol
near
the
shore
stood
a
large
russian
house
the
telegraph
station
between
kosogol
and
uliassutai
chapter
xxii
among
the
murderers
as
we
approached
the
telegraph
station
we
were
met
by
a
blonde
young
man
who
was
in
charge
of
the
office
kanine
by
name
with
some
little
confusion
he
offered
us
a
place
in
his
house
for
the
night
when
we
entered
the
room
a
tall
lanky
man
rose
from
the
table
and
indecisively
walked
toward
us
looking
very
attentively
at
us
the
while
guests
explained
kanine
they
are
going
to
khathyl
private
persons
strangers
foreigners
drawled
the
stranger
in
a
quiet
comprehending
tone
while
we
were
untying
our
girdles
and
with
difficulty
getting
out
of
our
great
mongolian
coats
the
tall
man
was
animatedly
whispering
something
to
our
host
as
we
approached
the
table
to
sit
down
and
rest
i
overheard
him
say
we
are
forced
to
postpone
it
and
saw
kanine
simply
nod
in
answer
several
other
people
were
seated
at
the
table
among
them
the
assistant
of
kanine
a
tall
blonde
man
with
a
white
face
who
talked
like
a
gatling
gun
about
everything
imaginable
he
was
half
crazy
and
his
expressed
itself
when
any
loud
talking
shouting
or
sudden
sharp
report
led
him
to
repeat
the
words
of
the
one
to
whom
he
was
talking
at
the
time
or
to
relate
in
a
mechanical
hurried
manner
stories
of
what
was
happening
around
him
just
at
this
particular
juncture
the
wife
of
kanine
a
pale
young
woman
with
frightened
eyes
and
a
face
distorted
by
fear
was
also
there
and
near
her
a
young
girl
of
fifteen
with
cropped
hair
and
dressed
like
a
man
as
well
as
the
two
small
sons
of
kanine
we
made
acquaintance
with
all
of
them
the
tall
stranger
called
himself
gorokoff
a
russian
colonist
from
samgaltai
and
presented
the
girl
as
his
sister
kanine
s
wife
looked
at
us
with
plainly
discernible
fear
and
said
nothing
evidently
displeased
over
our
being
there
however
we
had
no
choice
and
consequently
began
drinking
tea
and
eating
our
bread
and
cold
meat
kanine
told
us
that
ever
since
the
telegraph
line
had
been
destroyed
all
his
family
and
relatives
had
felt
very
keenly
the
poverty
and
hardship
that
naturally
followed
the
bolsheviki
did
not
send
him
any
salary
from
irkutsk
so
that
he
was
compelled
to
shift
for
himself
as
best
he
could
they
cut
and
cured
hay
for
sale
to
the
russian
colonists
handled
private
messages
and
merchandise
from
khathyl
to
uliassutai
and
samgaltai
bought
and
sold
cattle
hunted
and
in
this
manner
managed
to
exist
gorokoff
announced
that
his
commercial
affairs
compelled
him
to
go
to
khathyl
and
that
he
and
his
sister
would
be
glad
to
join
our
caravan
he
had
a
most
unprepossessing
face
with
colorless
eyes
that
always
avoided
those
of
the
person
with
whom
he
was
speaking
during
the
conversation
we
asked
kanine
if
there
were
russian
colonists
near
by
to
which
he
answered
with
knitted
brow
and
a
look
of
disgust
on
his
face
there
is
one
rich
old
man
bobroff
who
lives
a
verst
away
from
our
station
but
i
would
not
advise
you
to
visit
him
he
is
a
miserly
inhospitable
old
fellow
who
does
not
like
during
these
words
of
her
husband
madame
kanine
dropped
her
eyes
and
contracted
her
shoulders
in
something
resembling
a
shudder
gorokoff
and
his
sister
smoked
along
indifferently
i
very
clearly
remarked
all
this
as
well
as
the
hostile
tone
of
kanine
the
confusion
of
his
wife
and
the
artificial
indifference
of
gorokoff
and
i
determined
to
see
the
old
colonist
given
such
a
bad
name
by
kanine
in
uliassutai
i
knew
two
bobroffs
i
said
to
kanine
that
i
had
been
asked
to
hand
a
letter
personally
to
bobroff
and
after
finishing
my
tea
put
on
my
overcoat
and
went
out
the
house
of
bobroff
stood
in
a
deep
sink
in
the
mountains
surrounded
by
a
high
fence
over
which
the
low
roofs
of
the
houses
could
be
seen
a
light
shone
through
the
window
i
knocked
at
the
gate
a
furious
barking
of
dogs
answered
me
and
through
the
cracks
of
the
fence
i
made
out
four
huge
black
mongol
dogs
showing
their
teeth
and
growling
as
they
rushed
toward
the
gate
inside
the
court
someone
opened
the
door
and
called
out
who
is
there
i
answered
that
i
was
traveling
through
from
uliassutai
the
dogs
were
first
caught
and
chained
and
i
was
then
admitted
by
a
man
who
looked
me
over
very
carefully
and
inquiringly
from
head
to
foot
a
revolver
handle
stuck
out
of
his
pocket
satisfied
with
his
observations
and
learning
that
i
knew
his
relatives
he
warmly
welcomed
me
to
the
house
and
presented
me
to
his
wife
a
dignified
old
woman
and
to
his
beautiful
little
adopted
daughter
a
girl
of
five
years
she
had
been
found
on
the
plain
beside
the
dead
body
of
her
mother
exhausted
in
her
attempt
to
escape
from
the
bolsheviki
in
siberia
bobroff
told
me
that
the
russian
detachment
of
kazagrandi
had
succeeded
in
driving
the
red
troops
away
from
the
kosogol
and
that
we
could
consequently
continue
our
trip
to
khathyl
without
danger
why
did
you
not
stop
with
me
instead
of
with
those
brigands
asked
the
old
fellow
i
began
to
question
him
and
received
some
very
important
news
it
seemed
that
kanine
was
a
bolshevik
the
agent
of
the
irkutsk
soviet
and
stationed
here
for
purposes
of
observation
however
now
he
was
rendered
harmless
because
the
road
between
him
and
irkutsk
was
interrupted
still
from
biisk
in
the
altai
country
had
just
come
a
very
important
commissar
gorokoff
i
asked
that
s
what
he
calls
himself
replied
the
old
fellow
but
i
am
also
from
biisk
and
i
know
everyone
there
his
real
name
is
pouzikoff
and
the
girl
with
him
is
his
mistress
he
is
the
commissar
of
the
cheka
and
she
is
the
agent
of
this
establishment
last
august
the
two
of
them
shot
with
their
revolvers
seventy
bound
officers
from
kolchak
s
army
villainous
cowardly
murderers
now
they
have
come
here
for
a
reconnaissance
they
wanted
to
stay
in
my
house
but
i
knew
them
too
well
and
refused
them
and
you
do
not
fear
him
i
asked
remembering
the
different
words
and
glances
of
these
people
as
they
sat
at
the
table
in
the
station
no
answered
the
old
man
i
know
how
to
defend
myself
and
my
family
and
i
have
a
protector
too
my
son
such
a
shot
a
rider
and
a
fighter
as
does
not
exist
in
all
mongolia
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
will
not
make
the
acquaintance
of
my
boy
he
has
gone
off
to
the
herds
and
will
return
only
tomorrow
we
took
most
cordial
leave
of
each
other
and
i
promised
to
stop
with
him
on
my
return
well
what
yarns
did
bobroff
tell
you
about
us
was
the
question
with
which
kanine
and
gorokoff
met
me
when
i
came
back
to
the
station
nothing
about
you
i
answered
because
he
did
not
even
want
to
speak
with
me
when
he
found
out
that
i
was
staying
in
your
house
what
is
the
trouble
between
you
i
asked
of
them
expressing
complete
astonishment
on
my
face
it
is
an
old
score
growled
gorokoff
a
malicious
old
churl
kanine
added
in
agreement
the
while
the
frightened
eyes
of
his
wife
again
gave
expression
to
terrifying
horror
as
if
she
momentarily
expected
a
deadly
blow
gorokoff
began
to
pack
his
luggage
in
preparation
for
the
journey
with
us
the
following
morning
we
prepared
our
simple
beds
in
an
adjoining
room
and
went
to
sleep
i
whispered
to
my
friend
to
keep
his
revolver
handy
for
anything
that
might
happen
but
he
only
smiled
as
he
dragged
his
revolver
and
his
ax
from
his
coat
to
place
them
under
his
pillow
this
people
at
the
outset
seemed
to
me
very
suspicious
he
whispered
they
are
cooking
up
something
crooked
tomorrow
i
shall
ride
behind
this
gorokoff
and
shall
prepare
for
him
a
very
faithful
one
of
my
bullets
a
little
the
mongols
spent
the
night
under
their
tent
in
the
open
court
beside
their
camels
because
they
wanted
to
be
near
to
feed
them
about
seven
o
clock
we
started
my
friend
took
up
his
post
as
rear
guard
to
our
caravan
keeping
all
the
time
behind
gorokoff
who
with
his
sister
both
armed
from
tip
to
toe
rode
splendid
mounts
how
have
you
kept
your
horses
in
such
fine
condition
coming
all
the
way
from
samgaltai
i
inquired
as
i
looked
over
their
fine
beasts
when
he
answered
that
these
belonged
to
his
host
i
realized
that
kanine
was
not
so
poor
as
he
made
out
for
any
rich
mongol
would
have
given
him
in
exchange
for
one
of
these
lovely
animals
enough
sheep
to
have
kept
his
household
in
mutton
for
a
whole
year
soon
we
came
to
a
large
swamp
surrounded
by
dense
brush
where
i
was
much
astonished
by
seeing
literally
hundreds
of
white
kuropatka
or
partridges
out
of
the
water
rose
a
flock
of
duck
with
a
mad
rush
as
we
hove
in
sight
winter
cold
driving
wind
snow
and
wild
ducks
the
mongol
explained
it
to
me
thus
this
swamp
always
remains
warm
and
never
freezes
the
wild
ducks
live
here
the
year
round
and
the
kuropatka
too
finding
fresh
food
in
the
soft
warm
as
i
was
speaking
with
the
mongol
i
noticed
over
the
swamp
a
tongue
of
flame
it
flashed
and
disappeared
at
once
but
later
on
the
farther
edge
two
further
tongues
ran
upward
i
realized
that
here
was
the
real
surrounded
by
so
many
thousands
of
legends
and
explained
so
simply
by
chemistry
as
merely
a
flash
of
methane
or
swamp
gas
generated
by
the
putrefying
of
vegetable
matter
in
the
warm
damp
earth
here
dwell
the
demons
of
adair
who
are
in
perpetual
war
with
those
of
muren
explained
the
mongol
indeed
i
thought
if
in
prosaic
europe
in
our
days
the
inhabitants
of
our
villages
believe
these
flames
to
be
some
wild
sorcery
then
surely
in
the
land
of
mystery
they
must
be
at
least
the
evidences
of
war
between
the
demons
of
two
neighboring
rivers
after
passing
this
swamp
we
made
out
far
ahead
of
us
a
large
monastery
though
this
was
some
half
mile
off
the
road
the
gorokoffs
said
they
would
ride
over
to
it
to
make
some
purchases
in
the
chinese
shops
there
they
quickly
rode
away
promising
to
overtake
us
shortly
but
we
did
not
see
them
again
for
a
while
they
slipped
away
without
leaving
any
trail
but
we
met
them
later
in
very
unexpected
circumstances
of
fatal
portent
for
them
on
our
part
we
were
highly
satisfied
that
we
were
rid
of
them
so
soon
and
after
they
were
gone
i
imparted
to
my
friend
the
information
gleaned
from
bobroff
the
evening
before
chapter
xxiii
on
a
volcano
the
following
evening
we
arrived
at
khathyl
a
small
russian
settlement
of
ten
scattered
houses
in
the
valley
of
the
egingol
or
yaga
which
here
takes
its
waters
from
the
kosogol
half
a
mile
above
the
village
the
kosogol
is
a
huge
alpine
lake
deep
and
cold
miles
in
length
and
from
ten
to
thirty
in
width
on
the
western
shore
live
the
darkhat
soyots
who
call
it
hubsugul
the
mongols
kosogol
both
the
soyots
and
mongols
consider
this
a
terrible
and
sacred
lake
it
is
very
easy
to
understand
this
prejudice
because
the
lake
lies
in
a
region
of
present
volcanic
activity
where
in
the
summer
on
perfectly
calm
sunny
days
it
sometimes
lashes
itself
into
great
waves
that
are
dangerous
not
only
to
the
native
fishing
boats
but
also
to
the
large
russian
passenger
steamers
that
ply
on
the
lake
in
winter
also
it
sometimes
entirely
breaks
up
its
covering
of
ice
and
gives
off
great
clouds
of
steam
evidently
the
bottom
of
the
lake
is
sporadically
pierced
by
discharging
hot
springs
or
perhaps
by
streams
of
lava
evidence
of
some
great
underground
convulsion
like
this
is
afforded
by
the
mass
of
killed
fish
which
at
times
dams
the
outlet
river
in
its
shallow
places
the
lake
is
exceedingly
rich
in
fish
chiefly
varieties
of
trout
and
salmon
and
is
famous
for
its
wonderful
white
fish
which
was
previously
sent
all
over
siberia
and
even
down
into
manchuria
so
far
as
moukden
it
is
fat
and
remarkably
tender
and
produces
fine
caviar
another
variety
in
the
lake
is
the
white
khayrus
or
trout
which
in
the
migration
season
contrary
to
the
customs
of
most
fish
goes
down
stream
into
the
yaga
where
it
sometimes
fills
the
river
from
bank
to
bank
with
swarms
of
backs
breaking
the
surface
of
the
water
however
this
fish
is
not
caught
because
it
is
infested
with
worms
and
is
unfit
for
food
even
cats
and
dogs
will
not
touch
it
this
is
a
very
interesting
phemonenon
and
was
being
investigated
and
studied
by
professor
dorogostaisky
of
the
university
at
irkutsk
when
the
coming
of
the
bolsheviki
interrupted
his
work
in
khathyl
we
found
a
panic
the
russian
detachment
of
colonel
kazagrandi
after
having
twice
defeated
the
bolsheviki
and
well
on
its
march
against
irkutsk
was
suddenly
rendered
impotent
and
scattered
through
internal
strife
among
the
officers
the
bolsheviki
took
advantage
of
this
situation
increased
their
forces
to
one
thousand
men
and
began
a
forward
movement
to
recover
what
they
had
lost
while
the
remnants
of
colonel
kazagrandi
s
detachment
were
retreating
on
khathyl
where
he
determined
to
make
his
last
stand
against
the
reds
the
inhabitants
were
loading
their
movable
property
with
their
families
into
carts
and
scurrying
away
from
the
town
leaving
all
their
cattle
and
horses
to
whomsoever
should
have
the
power
to
seize
and
hold
them
one
party
intended
to
hide
in
the
dense
larch
forest
and
the
mountain
ravines
not
far
away
while
another
party
made
southward
for
muren
kure
and
uliassutai
the
morning
following
our
arrival
the
mongol
official
received
word
that
the
red
troops
had
outflanked
colonel
kazagrandi
s
men
and
were
approaching
khathyl
the
mongol
loaded
his
documents
and
his
servants
on
eleven
camels
and
left
his
yamen
our
mongol
guides
without
ever
saying
a
word
to
us
secretly
slipped
off
with
him
and
left
us
without
camels
our
situation
thus
became
desperate
we
hastened
to
the
colonists
who
had
not
yet
got
away
to
bargain
with
them
for
camels
but
they
had
previously
in
anticipation
of
trouble
sent
their
herds
to
distant
mongols
and
so
could
do
nothing
to
help
us
then
we
betook
ourselves
to
gay
a
veterinarian
living
in
the
town
famous
throughout
mongolia
for
his
battle
against
rinderpest
he
lived
here
with
his
family
and
after
being
forced
to
give
up
his
government
work
became
a
cattle
dealer
he
was
a
most
interesting
person
clever
and
energetic
and
the
one
who
had
been
appointed
under
the
czarist
regime
to
purchase
all
the
meat
supplies
from
mongolia
for
the
russian
army
on
the
german
front
he
organized
a
huge
enterprise
in
mongolia
but
when
the
bolsheviki
seized
power
in
he
transferred
his
allegiance
and
began
to
work
with
them
then
in
may
when
the
kolchak
forces
drove
the
bolsheviki
out
of
siberia
he
was
arrested
and
taken
for
trial
however
he
was
released
because
he
was
looked
upon
as
the
single
individual
to
organize
this
big
mongolian
enterprise
and
he
handed
to
admiral
kolchak
all
the
supplies
of
meat
and
the
silver
formerly
received
from
the
soviet
commissars
at
this
time
gay
had
been
serving
as
the
chief
organizer
and
supplier
of
the
forces
of
kazagrandi
when
we
went
to
him
he
at
once
suggested
that
we
take
the
only
thing
left
some
poor
horses
which
would
be
able
to
carry
us
the
sixty
miles
to
muren
kure
where
we
could
secure
camels
to
return
to
uliassutai
however
even
these
were
being
kept
some
distance
from
the
town
so
that
we
should
have
to
spend
the
night
there
the
night
in
which
the
red
troops
were
expected
to
arrive
also
we
were
much
astonished
to
see
that
gay
was
remaining
there
with
his
family
right
up
to
the
time
of
the
expected
arrival
of
the
reds
the
only
others
in
the
town
were
a
few
cossacks
who
had
been
ordered
to
stay
behind
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
red
troops
the
night
came
my
friend
and
i
were
prepared
either
to
fight
or
in
the
last
event
to
commit
suicide
we
stayed
in
a
small
house
near
the
yaga
where
some
workmen
were
living
who
could
not
and
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
leave
they
went
up
on
a
hill
from
which
they
could
scan
the
whole
country
up
to
the
range
from
behind
which
the
red
detachment
must
appear
from
this
vantage
point
in
the
forest
one
of
the
workmen
came
running
in
and
cried
out
woe
woe
to
us
the
reds
have
arrived
a
horseman
is
galloping
fast
through
the
forest
road
i
called
to
him
but
he
did
not
answer
me
it
was
dark
but
i
knew
the
horse
was
a
strange
do
not
babble
so
said
another
of
the
workmen
some
mongol
rode
by
and
you
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
no
it
was
not
a
mongol
he
replied
the
horse
was
shod
i
heard
the
sound
of
iron
shoes
on
the
road
woe
to
us
well
said
my
friend
it
seems
that
this
is
our
finish
it
is
a
silly
way
for
it
all
to
he
was
right
just
then
there
was
a
knock
at
our
door
but
it
was
that
of
the
mongol
bringing
us
three
horses
for
our
escape
immediately
we
saddled
them
packed
the
third
beast
with
our
tent
and
food
and
rode
off
at
once
to
take
leave
of
gay
in
his
house
we
found
the
whole
war
council
two
or
three
colonists
and
several
cossacks
had
galloped
from
the
mountains
and
announced
that
the
red
detachment
was
approaching
khathyl
but
would
remain
for
the
night
in
the
forest
where
they
were
building
campfires
in
fact
through
the
house
windows
we
could
see
the
glare
of
the
fires
it
seemed
very
strange
that
the
enemy
should
await
the
morning
there
in
the
forest
when
they
were
right
on
the
village
they
wished
to
capture
an
armed
cossack
entered
the
room
and
announced
that
two
armed
men
from
the
detachment
were
approaching
all
the
men
in
the
room
pricked
up
their
ears
outside
were
heard
the
horses
hoofs
followed
by
men
s
voices
and
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
said
gay
two
young
men
entered
their
moustaches
and
beards
white
and
their
cheeks
blazing
red
from
the
cold
they
were
dressed
in
the
common
siberian
overcoat
with
the
big
astrakhan
caps
but
they
had
no
weapons
questions
began
it
developed
that
it
was
a
detachment
of
white
peasants
from
the
irkutsk
and
yakutsk
districts
who
had
been
fighting
with
the
bolsheviki
they
had
been
defeated
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
irkutsk
and
were
now
trying
to
make
a
junction
with
kazagrandi
the
leader
of
this
band
was
a
socialist
captain
vassilieff
who
had
suffered
much
under
the
czar
because
of
his
tenets
our
troubles
had
vanished
but
we
decided
to
start
immediately
to
muren
kure
as
we
had
gathered
our
information
and
were
in
a
hurry
to
make
our
report
we
started
on
the
road
we
overtook
three
cossacks
who
were
going
out
to
bring
back
the
colonists
who
were
fleeing
to
the
south
we
joined
them
and
dismounting
we
all
led
our
horses
over
the
ice
the
yaga
was
mad
the
subterranean
forces
produced
underneath
the
ice
great
heaving
waves
which
with
a
swirling
roar
threw
up
and
tore
loose
great
sections
of
ice
breaking
them
into
small
blocks
and
sucking
them
under
the
unbroken
downstream
field
cracks
ran
like
snakes
over
the
surface
in
different
directions
one
of
the
cossacks
fell
into
one
of
these
but
we
had
just
time
to
save
him
he
was
forced
by
his
ducking
in
such
extreme
cold
to
turn
back
to
khathyl
our
horses
slipped
about
and
fell
several
times
men
and
animals
felt
the
presence
of
death
which
hovered
over
them
and
momentarily
threatened
them
with
destruction
at
last
we
made
the
farther
bank
and
continued
southward
down
the
valley
glad
to
have
left
the
geological
and
figurative
volcanoes
behind
us
ten
miles
farther
on
we
came
up
with
the
first
party
of
refugees
they
had
spread
a
big
tent
and
made
a
fire
inside
filling
it
with
warmth
and
smoke
their
camp
was
made
beside
the
establishment
of
a
large
chinese
trading
house
where
the
owners
refused
to
let
the
colonists
come
into
their
amply
spacious
buildings
even
though
there
were
children
women
and
invalids
among
the
refugees
we
spent
but
half
an
hour
here
the
road
as
we
continued
was
easy
save
in
places
where
the
snow
lay
deep
we
crossed
the
fairly
high
divide
between
the
egingol
and
muren
near
the
pass
one
very
unexpected
event
occurred
to
us
we
crossed
the
mouth
of
a
fairly
wide
valley
whose
upper
end
was
covered
with
a
dense
wood
near
this
wood
we
noticed
two
horsemen
evidently
watching
us
their
manner
of
sitting
in
their
saddles
and
the
character
of
their
horses
told
us
that
they
were
not
mongols
we
began
shouting
and
waving
to
them
but
they
did
not
answer
out
of
the
wood
emerged
a
third
and
stopped
to
look
at
us
we
decided
to
interview
them
and
whipping
up
our
horses
galloped
toward
them
when
we
were
about
one
thousand
yards
from
them
they
slipped
from
their
saddles
and
opened
on
us
with
a
running
fire
fortunately
we
rode
a
little
apart
and
thus
made
a
poor
target
for
them
we
jumped
off
our
horses
dropped
prone
on
the
ground
and
prepared
to
fight
however
we
did
not
fire
because
we
thought
it
might
be
a
mistake
on
their
part
thinking
that
we
were
reds
they
shortly
made
off
their
shots
from
the
european
rifles
had
given
us
further
proof
that
they
were
not
mongols
we
waited
until
they
had
disappeared
into
the
woods
and
then
went
forward
to
investigate
their
tracks
which
we
found
were
those
of
shod
horses
clearly
corroborating
the
earlier
evidence
that
they
were
not
mongols
who
could
they
have
been
we
never
found
out
yet
what
a
different
relationship
they
might
have
borne
to
our
lives
had
their
shots
been
true
after
we
had
passed
over
the
divide
we
met
the
russian
colonist
teternikoff
from
muren
kure
who
invited
us
to
stay
in
his
house
and
promised
to
secure
camels
for
us
from
the
lamas
the
cold
was
intense
and
heightened
by
a
piercing
wind
during
the
day
we
froze
to
the
bone
but
at
night
thawed
and
warmed
up
nicely
by
our
tent
stove
after
two
days
we
entered
the
valley
of
muren
and
from
afar
made
out
the
square
of
the
kure
with
its
chinese
roofs
and
large
red
temples
nearby
was
a
second
square
the
chinese
and
russian
settlement
two
hours
more
brought
us
to
the
house
of
our
hospitable
companion
and
his
attractive
young
wife
who
feasted
us
with
a
wonderful
luncheon
of
tasty
dishes
we
spent
five
days
at
muren
waiting
for
the
camels
to
be
engaged
during
this
time
many
refugees
arrived
from
khathyl
because
colonel
kazagrandi
was
gradually
falling
back
upon
the
town
among
others
there
were
two
colonels
plavako
and
maklakoff
who
had
caused
the
disruption
of
the
kazagrandi
force
no
sooner
had
the
refugees
appeared
in
muren
kure
than
the
mongolian
officials
announced
that
the
chinese
authorities
had
ordered
them
to
drive
out
all
russian
refugees
where
can
we
go
now
in
winter
with
women
and
children
and
no
homes
of
our
own
asked
the
distraught
refugees
that
is
of
no
moment
to
us
answered
the
mongolian
officials
the
chinese
authorities
are
angry
and
have
ordered
us
to
drive
you
away
we
can
not
help
you
at
the
refugees
had
to
leave
muren
kure
and
so
erected
their
tents
in
the
open
not
far
away
plavako
and
maklakoff
bought
horses
and
started
out
for
van
kure
long
afterwards
i
learned
that
both
had
been
killed
by
the
chinese
along
the
road
we
secured
three
camels
and
started
out
with
a
large
group
of
chinese
merchants
and
russian
refugees
to
make
uliassutai
preserving
the
warmest
recollections
of
our
courteous
hosts
and
teternikoff
for
the
trip
we
had
to
pay
for
our
camels
the
very
high
price
of
lan
of
the
silver
bullion
which
had
been
supplied
us
by
an
american
firm
in
uliassutai
the
equivalent
roughly
of
pounds
of
the
white
metal
chapter
xxiv
a
bloody
chastisement
before
long
we
struck
the
road
which
we
had
travelled
coming
north
and
saw
again
the
kindly
rows
of
chopped
down
telegraph
poles
which
had
once
so
warmly
protected
us
over
the
timbered
hillocks
north
of
the
valley
of
tisingol
we
wended
just
as
it
was
growing
dark
we
decided
to
stay
in
bobroff
s
house
and
our
companions
thought
to
seek
the
hospitality
of
kanine
in
the
telegraph
station
at
the
station
gate
we
found
a
soldier
with
a
rifle
who
questioned
us
as
to
who
we
were
and
whence
we
had
come
and
being
apparently
satisfied
whistled
out
a
young
officer
from
the
house
lieutenant
ivanoff
he
introduced
himself
i
am
staying
here
with
my
detachment
of
white
he
had
come
from
near
irkutsk
with
his
following
of
ten
men
and
had
formed
a
connection
with
michailoff
at
uliassutai
who
commanded
him
to
take
possession
of
this
blockhouse
enter
please
he
said
hospitably
i
explained
to
him
that
i
wanted
to
stay
with
bobroff
whereat
he
made
a
despairing
gesture
with
his
hand
and
said
don
t
trouble
yourself
the
bobroffs
are
killed
and
their
house
i
could
not
keep
back
a
cry
of
horror
the
lieutenant
continued
kanine
and
the
pouzikoffs
killed
them
pillaged
the
place
and
afterwards
burned
the
house
with
their
dead
bodies
in
it
do
you
want
to
see
it
my
friend
and
i
went
with
the
lieutenant
and
looked
over
the
ominous
site
blackened
uprights
stood
among
charred
beams
and
planks
while
crockery
and
iron
pots
and
pans
were
scattered
all
around
a
little
to
one
side
under
some
felt
lay
the
remains
of
the
four
unfortunate
individuals
the
lieutenant
first
spoke
i
reported
the
case
to
uliassutai
and
received
word
back
that
the
relatives
of
the
deceased
would
come
with
two
officers
who
would
investigate
the
affair
that
is
why
i
can
not
bury
the
how
did
it
happen
we
asked
oppressed
by
the
sad
picture
it
was
like
this
he
began
i
was
approaching
tisingol
at
night
with
my
ten
soldiers
fearing
that
there
might
be
reds
here
we
sneaked
up
to
the
station
and
looked
into
the
windows
we
saw
pouzikoff
kanine
and
the
girl
looking
over
and
dividing
clothes
and
other
things
and
weighing
lumps
of
silver
i
did
not
at
once
grasp
the
significance
of
all
this
but
feeling
the
need
for
continued
caution
ordered
one
of
my
soldiers
to
climb
the
fence
and
open
the
gate
we
rushed
into
the
court
the
first
to
run
from
the
house
was
kanine
s
wife
who
threw
up
her
hands
and
shrieked
in
fear
i
knew
that
misfortune
would
come
of
all
this
and
then
fainted
one
of
the
men
ran
out
of
a
side
door
to
a
shed
in
the
yard
and
there
tried
to
get
over
the
fence
i
had
not
noticed
him
but
one
of
my
soldiers
caught
him
we
were
met
at
the
door
by
kanine
who
was
white
and
trembling
i
realized
that
something
important
had
taken
place
placed
them
all
under
arrest
ordered
the
men
tied
and
placed
a
close
guard
all
my
questions
were
met
with
silence
save
by
madame
kanine
who
cried
pity
pity
for
the
children
they
are
innocent
as
she
dropped
on
her
knees
and
stretched
out
her
hands
in
supplication
to
us
the
girl
laughed
out
of
impudent
eyes
and
blew
a
puff
of
smoke
into
my
face
i
was
forced
to
threaten
them
and
said
i
know
that
you
have
committed
some
crime
but
you
do
not
want
to
confess
if
you
do
not
i
shall
shoot
the
men
and
take
the
women
to
uliassutai
to
try
them
i
spoke
with
definiteness
of
voice
and
intention
for
they
roused
my
deepest
anger
quite
to
my
surprise
the
girl
first
began
to
speak
i
want
to
tell
you
about
everything
she
said
i
ordered
ink
paper
and
pen
brought
me
my
soldiers
were
the
witnesses
then
i
prepared
the
protocol
of
the
confession
of
pouzikoff
s
wife
this
was
her
dark
and
bloody
tale
my
husband
and
i
are
bolshevik
commissars
and
we
have
been
sent
to
find
out
how
many
white
officers
are
hidden
in
mongolia
but
the
old
fellow
bobroff
knew
us
we
wanted
to
go
away
but
kanine
kept
us
telling
us
that
bobroff
was
rich
and
that
he
had
for
a
long
time
wanted
to
kill
him
and
pillage
his
place
we
agreed
to
join
him
we
decoyed
the
young
bobroff
to
come
and
play
cards
with
us
when
he
was
going
home
my
husband
stole
along
behind
and
shot
him
afterwards
we
all
went
to
bobroff
s
place
i
climbed
upon
the
fence
and
threw
some
poisoned
meat
to
the
dogs
who
were
dead
in
a
few
minutes
then
we
all
climbed
over
the
first
person
to
emerge
from
the
house
was
bobroff
s
wife
pouzikoff
who
was
hidden
behind
the
door
killed
her
with
his
ax
the
old
fellow
we
killed
with
a
blow
of
the
ax
as
he
slept
the
little
girl
ran
out
into
the
room
as
she
heard
the
noise
and
kanine
shot
her
in
the
head
with
buckshot
afterwards
we
looted
the
house
and
burned
it
even
destroying
the
horses
and
cattle
later
all
would
have
been
completely
burned
so
that
no
traces
remained
but
you
suddenly
arrived
and
these
stupid
fellows
at
once
betrayed
it
was
a
dastardly
affair
continued
the
lieutenant
as
we
returned
to
the
station
the
hair
raised
on
my
head
as
i
listened
to
the
calm
description
of
this
young
woman
hardly
more
than
a
girl
only
then
did
i
fully
realize
what
depravity
bolshevism
had
brought
into
the
world
crushing
out
faith
fear
of
god
and
conscience
only
then
did
i
understand
that
all
honest
people
must
fight
without
compromise
against
this
most
dangerous
enemy
of
mankind
so
long
as
life
and
strength
as
we
walked
i
noticed
at
the
side
of
the
road
a
black
spot
it
attracted
and
fixed
my
attention
what
is
that
i
asked
pointing
to
the
spot
it
is
the
murderer
pouzikoff
whom
i
shot
answered
the
lieutenant
i
would
have
shot
both
kanine
and
the
wife
of
pouzikoff
but
i
was
sorry
for
kanine
s
wife
and
children
and
i
haven
t
learned
the
lesson
of
shooting
women
now
i
shall
send
them
along
with
you
under
the
surveillance
of
my
soldiers
to
uliassutai
the
same
result
will
come
for
the
mongols
who
try
them
for
the
murder
will
surely
kill
this
is
what
happened
at
tisingol
on
whose
shores
the
flits
over
the
marshy
pools
and
near
which
runs
the
cleavage
of
over
two
hundred
miles
that
the
last
earthquake
left
in
the
surface
of
the
land
maybe
it
was
out
of
this
cleavage
that
pouzikoff
kanine
and
the
others
who
have
sought
to
infect
the
whole
world
with
horror
and
crime
made
their
appearance
from
the
land
of
the
inferno
one
of
lieutenant
ivanoff
s
soldiers
who
was
always
praying
and
pale
called
them
all
the
servants
of
our
trip
from
tisingol
to
uliassutai
in
the
company
of
these
criminals
was
very
unpleasant
my
friend
and
i
entirely
lost
our
usual
strength
of
spirit
and
healthy
frame
of
mind
kanine
persistently
brooded
and
thought
while
the
impudent
woman
laughed
smoked
and
joked
with
the
soldiers
and
several
of
our
companions
at
last
we
crossed
the
jagisstai
and
in
a
few
hours
descried
at
first
the
fortress
and
then
the
low
adobe
houses
huddled
on
the
plain
which
we
knew
to
be
uliassutai
chapter
xxv
harassing
days
once
more
we
found
ourselves
in
the
whirl
of
events
during
our
fortnight
away
a
great
deal
had
happened
here
the
chinese
commissioner
wang
had
sent
eleven
envoys
to
urga
but
none
had
returned
the
situation
in
mongolia
remained
far
from
clear
the
russian
detachment
had
been
increased
by
the
arrival
of
new
colonists
and
secretly
continued
its
illegal
existence
although
the
chinese
knew
about
it
through
their
omnipresent
system
of
spies
in
the
town
no
russian
or
foreign
citizens
left
their
houses
and
all
remained
armed
and
ready
to
act
at
night
armed
sentinels
stood
guard
in
all
their
it
was
the
chinese
who
induced
such
precautions
by
order
of
their
commissioner
all
the
chinese
merchants
with
stocks
of
rifles
armed
their
staffs
and
handed
over
any
surplus
guns
to
the
officials
who
with
these
formed
and
equipped
a
force
of
two
hundred
coolies
into
a
special
garrison
of
gamins
then
they
took
possession
of
the
mongolian
arsenal
and
distributed
these
additional
guns
among
the
chinese
vegetable
farmers
in
the
nagan
hushun
where
there
was
always
a
floating
population
of
the
lowest
grade
of
transient
chinese
laborers
this
trash
of
china
now
felt
themselves
strong
gathered
together
in
excited
discussions
and
evidently
were
preparing
for
some
outburst
of
aggression
at
night
the
coolies
transported
many
boxes
of
cartridges
from
the
chinese
shops
to
the
nagan
hushun
and
the
behaviour
of
the
chinese
mob
became
unbearably
audacious
these
coolies
and
gamins
impertinently
stopped
and
searched
people
right
on
the
streets
and
sought
to
provoke
fights
that
would
allow
them
to
take
anything
they
wanted
through
secret
news
we
received
from
certain
chinese
quarters
we
learned
that
the
chinese
were
preparing
a
pogrom
for
all
the
russians
and
mongols
in
uliassutai
we
fully
realized
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
fire
one
single
house
at
the
right
part
of
the
town
and
the
entire
settlement
of
wooden
buildings
would
go
up
in
flames
the
whole
population
prepared
to
defend
themselves
increased
the
sentinels
in
the
compounds
appointed
leaders
for
certain
sections
of
the
town
organized
a
special
fire
brigade
and
prepared
horses
carts
and
food
for
a
hasty
flight
the
situation
became
worse
when
news
arrived
from
kobdo
that
the
chinese
there
had
made
a
pogrom
killing
some
of
the
inhabitants
and
burning
the
whole
town
after
a
wild
looting
orgy
most
of
the
people
got
away
to
the
forests
on
the
mountains
but
it
was
at
night
and
consequently
without
warm
clothes
and
without
food
during
the
following
days
these
mountains
around
kobdo
heard
many
cries
of
misfortune
woe
and
death
the
severe
cold
and
hunger
killed
off
the
women
and
children
out
under
the
open
sky
of
the
mongolian
winter
this
news
was
soon
known
to
the
chinese
they
laughed
in
mockery
and
soon
organized
a
big
meeting
at
the
nagan
hushun
to
discuss
letting
the
mob
and
gamins
loose
on
the
town
a
young
chinese
the
son
of
a
cook
of
one
of
the
colonists
revealed
this
news
we
immediately
decided
to
make
an
investigation
a
russian
officer
and
my
friend
joined
me
with
this
young
chinese
as
a
guide
for
a
trip
to
the
outskirts
of
the
town
we
feigned
simply
a
stroll
but
were
stopped
by
the
chinese
sentinel
on
the
side
of
the
city
toward
the
nagan
hushun
with
an
impertinent
command
that
no
one
was
allowed
to
leave
the
town
as
we
spoke
with
him
i
noticed
that
between
the
town
and
the
nagan
hushun
chinese
guards
were
stationed
all
along
the
way
and
that
streams
of
chinese
were
moving
in
that
direction
we
saw
at
once
it
was
impossible
to
reach
the
meeting
from
this
approach
so
we
chose
another
route
we
left
the
city
from
the
eastern
side
and
passed
along
by
the
camp
of
the
mongolians
who
had
been
reduced
to
beggary
by
the
chinese
impositions
there
also
they
were
evidently
anxiously
awaiting
the
turn
of
events
for
in
spite
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
none
had
gone
to
sleep
we
slipped
out
on
the
ice
and
worked
around
by
the
river
to
the
nagan
hushun
as
we
passed
free
of
the
city
we
began
to
sneak
cautiously
along
taking
advantage
of
every
bit
of
cover
we
were
armed
with
revolvers
and
hand
grenades
and
knew
that
a
small
detachment
had
been
prepared
in
the
town
to
come
to
our
aid
if
we
should
be
in
danger
first
the
young
chinese
stole
forward
with
my
friend
following
him
like
a
shadow
constantly
reminding
him
that
he
would
strangle
him
like
a
mouse
if
he
made
one
move
to
betray
us
i
fear
the
young
guide
did
not
greatly
enjoy
the
trip
with
my
gigantic
friend
puffing
all
too
loudly
with
the
unusual
exertions
at
last
the
fences
of
nagan
hushun
were
in
sight
and
nothing
between
us
and
them
save
the
open
plain
where
our
group
would
have
been
easily
spotted
so
that
we
decided
to
crawl
up
one
by
one
save
that
the
chinese
was
retained
in
the
society
of
my
trusted
friend
fortunately
there
were
many
heaps
of
frozen
manure
on
the
plain
which
we
made
use
of
as
cover
to
lead
us
right
up
to
our
objective
point
the
fence
of
the
enclosures
in
the
shadow
of
this
we
slunk
along
to
the
courtyard
where
the
voices
of
the
excited
crowd
beckoned
us
as
we
took
good
vantage
points
in
the
darkness
for
listening
and
making
observations
we
remarked
two
extraordinary
things
in
our
immediate
neighborhood
another
invisible
guest
was
present
with
us
at
the
chinese
gathering
he
lay
on
the
ground
with
his
head
in
a
hole
dug
by
the
dogs
under
the
fence
he
was
perfectly
still
and
evidently
had
not
heard
our
advance
nearby
in
a
ditch
lay
a
white
horse
with
his
nose
muzzled
and
a
little
further
away
stood
another
saddled
horse
tied
to
a
fence
in
the
courtyard
there
was
a
great
hubbub
about
two
thousand
men
were
shouting
arguing
and
flourishing
their
arms
about
in
wild
gesticulations
nearly
all
were
armed
with
rifles
revolvers
swords
and
axes
in
among
the
crowd
circulated
the
gamins
constantly
talking
handing
out
papers
explaining
and
assuring
finally
a
big
chinese
mounted
the
well
combing
waved
his
rifle
about
over
his
head
and
opened
a
tirade
in
strong
sharp
tones
he
is
assuring
the
people
said
our
interpreter
that
they
must
do
here
what
the
chinese
have
done
in
kobdo
and
must
secure
from
the
commissioner
the
assurance
of
an
order
to
his
guard
not
to
prevent
the
carrying
out
of
their
plans
also
that
the
chinese
commissioner
must
demand
from
the
russians
all
their
weapons
then
we
shall
take
vengeance
on
the
russians
for
their
blagoveschensk
crime
when
they
drowned
three
thousand
chinese
in
you
remain
here
while
i
go
to
the
commissioner
and
talk
with
he
jumped
down
from
the
well
and
quickly
made
his
way
to
the
gate
toward
the
town
at
once
i
saw
the
man
who
was
lying
with
his
head
under
the
fence
draw
back
out
of
his
hole
take
his
white
horse
from
the
ditch
and
then
run
over
to
untie
the
other
horse
and
lead
them
both
back
to
our
side
which
was
away
from
the
city
he
left
the
second
horse
there
and
hid
himself
around
the
corner
of
the
hushun
the
spokesman
went
out
of
the
gate
and
seeing
his
horse
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
enclosure
slung
his
rifle
across
his
back
and
started
for
his
mount
he
had
gone
about
half
way
when
the
stranger
behind
the
corner
of
the
fence
suddenly
galloped
out
and
in
a
flash
literally
swung
the
man
clear
from
the
ground
up
across
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
where
we
saw
him
tie
the
mouth
of
the
chinese
with
a
cloth
and
dash
off
with
him
toward
the
west
away
from
the
town
who
do
you
suppose
he
is
i
asked
of
my
friend
who
answered
up
at
once
it
must
be
tushegoun
lama
his
whole
appearance
did
strongly
remind
me
of
this
mysterious
lama
avenger
and
his
manner
of
addressing
himself
to
his
enemy
was
a
strict
replica
of
that
of
tushegoun
late
in
the
night
we
learned
that
some
time
after
their
orator
had
gone
to
seek
the
commissioner
s
cooperation
in
their
venture
his
head
had
been
flung
over
the
fence
into
the
midst
of
the
waiting
audience
and
that
eight
gamins
had
disappeared
on
their
way
from
the
hushun
to
the
town
without
leaving
trace
or
trail
this
event
terrorized
the
chinese
mob
and
calmed
their
heated
spirits
the
next
day
we
received
very
unexpected
aid
a
young
mongol
galloped
in
from
urga
his
overcoat
torn
his
hair
all
dishevelled
and
fallen
to
his
shoulders
and
a
revolver
prominent
beneath
his
girdle
proceeding
directly
to
the
market
where
the
mongols
are
always
gathered
without
leaving
his
saddle
he
cried
out
urga
is
captured
by
our
mongols
and
chiang
chun
baron
ungern
bogdo
hutuktu
is
once
more
our
khan
mongols
kill
the
chinese
and
pillage
their
shops
our
patience
is
exhausted
through
the
crowd
rose
the
roar
of
excitement
the
rider
was
surrounded
with
a
mob
of
insistent
questioners
the
old
mongol
sait
chultun
beyli
who
had
been
dismissed
by
the
chinese
was
at
once
informed
of
this
news
and
asked
to
have
the
messenger
brought
to
him
after
questioning
the
man
he
arrested
him
for
inciting
the
people
to
riot
but
he
refused
to
turn
him
over
to
the
chinese
authorities
i
was
personally
with
the
sait
at
the
time
and
heard
his
decision
in
the
matter
when
the
chinese
commissioner
wang
threatened
the
sait
for
disobedience
to
his
authority
the
old
man
simply
fingered
his
rosary
and
said
i
believe
the
story
of
this
mongol
in
its
every
word
and
i
apprehend
that
you
and
i
shall
soon
have
to
reverse
our
i
felt
that
wang
also
accepted
the
correctness
of
the
mongol
s
story
because
he
did
not
insist
further
from
this
moment
the
chinese
disappeared
from
the
streets
of
uliassutai
as
though
they
never
had
been
and
synchronously
the
patrols
of
the
russian
officers
and
of
our
foreign
colony
took
their
places
the
panic
among
the
chinese
was
heightened
by
the
receipt
of
a
letter
containing
the
news
that
the
mongols
and
altai
tartars
under
the
leadership
of
the
tartar
officer
kaigorodoff
pursued
the
chinese
who
were
making
off
with
their
booty
from
the
sack
of
kobdo
and
overtook
and
annihilated
them
on
the
borders
of
sinkiang
another
part
of
the
letter
told
how
general
bakitch
and
the
six
thousand
men
who
had
been
interned
with
him
by
the
chinese
authorities
on
the
river
amyl
had
received
arms
and
started
to
join
with
ataman
annenkoff
who
had
been
interned
in
kuldja
with
the
ultimate
intention
of
linking
up
with
baron
ungern
this
rumour
proved
to
be
wrong
because
neither
bakitch
nor
annenkoff
entertained
this
intention
because
annenkoff
had
been
transported
by
the
chinese
into
the
depths
of
turkestan
however
the
news
produced
veritable
stupefaction
among
the
chinese
just
at
this
time
there
arrived
at
the
house
of
the
bolshevist
russian
colonist
bourdukoff
three
bolshevik
agents
from
irkutsk
named
saltikoff
freimann
and
novak
who
started
an
agitation
among
the
chinese
authorities
to
get
them
to
disarm
the
russian
officers
and
hand
them
over
to
the
reds
they
persuaded
the
chinese
chamber
of
commerce
to
petition
the
irkutsk
soviet
to
send
a
detachment
of
reds
to
uliassutai
for
the
protection
of
the
chinese
against
the
white
detachments
freimann
brought
with
him
communistic
pamphlets
in
mongolian
and
instructions
to
begin
the
reconstruction
of
the
telegraph
line
to
irkutsk
bourdukoff
also
received
some
messages
from
the
bolsheviki
this
quartette
developed
their
policy
very
successfully
and
soon
saw
wang
fall
in
with
their
schemes
once
more
the
days
of
expecting
a
pogrom
in
uliassutai
returned
to
us
the
russian
officers
anticipated
attempts
to
arrest
them
the
representative
of
one
of
the
american
firms
went
with
me
to
the
commissioner
for
a
parley
we
pointed
out
to
him
the
illegality
of
his
acts
inasmuch
as
he
was
not
authorized
by
his
government
to
treat
with
the
bolsheviki
when
the
soviet
government
had
not
been
recognized
by
peking
wang
and
his
advisor
fu
hsiang
were
palpably
confused
at
finding
we
knew
of
his
secret
meetings
with
the
bolshevik
agents
he
assured
us
that
his
guard
was
sufficient
to
prevent
any
such
pogrom
it
was
quite
true
that
his
guard
was
very
capable
as
it
consisted
of
well
trained
and
disciplined
soldiers
under
the
command
of
a
and
well
educated
officer
but
what
could
eighty
soldiers
do
against
a
mob
of
three
thousand
coolies
one
thousand
armed
merchants
and
two
hundred
gamins
we
strongly
registered
our
apprehensions
and
urged
him
to
avoid
any
bloodshed
pointing
out
that
the
foreign
and
russian
population
were
determined
to
defend
themselves
to
the
last
moment
wang
at
once
ordered
the
establishment
of
strong
guards
on
the
streets
and
thus
made
a
very
interesting
picture
with
all
the
russian
foreign
and
chinese
patrols
moving
up
and
down
throughout
the
whole
town
then
we
did
not
know
there
were
three
hundred
more
sentinels
on
duty
the
men
of
tushegoun
lama
hidden
nearby
in
the
mountains
once
more
the
picture
changed
very
sharply
and
suddenly
the
mongolian
sait
received
news
through
the
lamas
of
the
nearest
monastery
that
colonel
kazagrandi
after
fighting
with
the
chinese
irregulars
had
captured
van
kure
and
had
formed
there
brigades
of
cavalry
mobilizing
the
mongols
by
the
order
of
the
living
buddha
and
the
russians
by
order
of
baron
ungern
a
few
hours
later
it
became
known
that
in
the
large
monastery
of
dzain
the
chinese
soldiers
had
killed
the
russian
captain
barsky
and
as
a
result
some
of
the
troops
of
kazagrandi
attacked
and
swept
the
chinese
out
of
the
place
at
the
taking
of
van
kure
the
russians
arrested
a
korean
communist
who
was
on
his
way
from
moscow
with
gold
and
propaganda
to
work
in
korea
and
america
colonel
kazagrandi
sent
this
korean
with
his
freight
of
gold
to
baron
ungern
after
receiving
this
news
the
chief
of
the
russian
detachment
in
uliassutai
arrested
all
the
bolsheviki
agents
and
passed
judgment
upon
them
and
upon
the
murderers
of
the
bobroffs
kanine
madame
pouzikoff
and
freimann
were
shot
regarding
saltikoff
and
novak
some
doubt
sprang
up
and
moreover
saltikoff
escaped
and
hid
while
novak
under
advice
from
lieutenant
colonel
michailoff
left
for
the
west
the
chief
of
the
russian
detachment
gave
out
orders
for
the
mobilization
of
the
russian
colonists
and
openly
took
uliassutai
under
his
protection
with
the
tacit
agreement
of
the
mongolian
authorities
the
mongol
sait
chultun
beyli
convened
a
council
of
the
neighboring
mongolian
princes
the
soul
of
which
was
the
noted
mongolian
patriot
hun
jap
lama
the
princes
quickly
formulated
their
demands
upon
the
chinese
for
the
complete
evacuation
of
the
territory
subject
to
the
sait
chultun
beyli
out
of
it
grew
parleys
threats
and
friction
between
the
various
chinese
and
mongolian
elements
wang
proposed
his
scheme
of
settlement
which
some
of
the
mongolian
princes
accepted
but
jap
lama
at
the
decisive
moment
threw
the
chinese
document
to
the
ground
drew
his
knife
and
swore
that
he
would
die
by
his
own
hand
rather
than
set
it
as
a
seal
upon
this
treacherous
agreement
as
a
result
the
chinese
proposals
were
rejected
and
the
antagonists
began
to
prepare
themselves
for
the
struggle
all
the
armed
mongols
were
summoned
from
jassaktu
khan
khan
and
the
dominion
of
jahantsi
lama
the
chinese
authorities
placed
their
four
machine
guns
and
prepared
to
defend
the
fortress
continuous
deliberations
were
held
by
both
the
chinese
and
mongols
finally
our
old
acquaintance
tzeren
came
to
me
as
one
of
the
unconcerned
foreigners
and
handed
to
me
the
joint
requests
of
wang
and
chultun
beyli
to
try
to
pacify
the
two
elements
and
to
work
out
a
fair
agreement
between
them
similar
requests
were
handed
to
the
representative
of
an
american
firm
the
following
evening
we
held
the
first
meeting
of
the
arbitrators
and
the
chinese
and
mongolian
representatives
it
was
passionate
and
stormy
so
that
we
foreigners
lost
all
hope
of
the
success
of
our
mission
however
at
midnight
when
the
speakers
were
tired
we
secured
agreement
on
two
points
the
mongols
announced
that
they
did
not
want
to
make
war
and
that
they
desired
to
settle
this
matter
in
such
a
way
as
to
retain
the
friendship
of
the
great
chinese
people
while
the
chinese
commissioner
acknowledged
that
china
had
violated
the
treaties
by
which
full
independence
had
been
legally
granted
to
mongolia
these
two
points
formed
for
us
the
groundwork
of
the
next
meeting
and
gave
us
the
starting
points
for
urging
reconciliation
the
deliberations
continued
for
three
days
and
finally
turned
so
that
we
foreigners
could
propose
our
suggestions
for
an
agreement
its
chief
provisions
were
that
the
chinese
authorities
should
surrender
administrative
powers
return
the
arms
to
the
mongolians
disarm
the
two
hundred
gamins
and
leave
the
country
and
that
the
mongols
on
their
side
should
give
free
and
honorable
passage
of
their
country
to
the
commissioner
with
his
armed
guard
of
eighty
men
this
treaty
of
uliassutai
was
signed
and
sealed
by
the
chinese
commissioners
wang
and
fu
hsiang
by
both
mongolian
saits
by
hun
jap
lama
and
other
princes
as
well
as
by
the
russian
and
chinese
presidents
of
the
chambers
of
commerce
and
by
us
foreign
arbitrators
the
chinese
officials
and
convoy
began
at
once
to
pack
up
their
belongings
and
prepare
for
departure
the
chinese
merchants
remained
in
uliassutai
because
sait
chultun
beyli
now
having
full
authority
and
power
guaranteed
their
safety
the
day
of
departure
for
the
expedition
of
wang
arrived
the
camels
with
their
packs
already
filled
the
yamen
and
the
men
only
awaited
the
arrival
of
their
horses
from
the
plains
suddenly
the
news
spread
everywhere
that
the
herd
of
horses
had
been
stolen
during
the
night
and
run
off
toward
the
south
of
two
soldiers
that
had
been
sent
out
to
follow
the
tracks
of
the
herd
only
one
came
back
with
the
news
that
the
other
had
been
killed
astonishment
spread
over
the
whole
town
while
among
the
chinese
it
turned
to
open
panic
it
perceptibly
increased
when
some
mongols
from
a
distant
ourton
to
the
east
came
in
and
announced
that
in
various
places
along
the
post
road
to
urga
they
had
discovered
the
bodies
of
sixteen
of
the
soldiers
whom
wang
had
sent
out
with
letters
for
urga
the
mystery
of
these
events
will
soon
be
explained
the
chief
of
the
russian
detachment
received
a
letter
from
a
cossack
colonel
domojiroff
containing
the
order
to
disarm
immediately
the
chinese
garrison
to
arrest
all
chinese
officials
for
transport
to
baron
ungern
at
urga
to
take
control
of
uliassutai
by
force
if
necessary
and
to
join
forces
with
his
detachment
at
the
very
same
time
a
messenger
from
the
narabanchi
hutuktu
galloped
in
with
a
letter
to
the
effect
that
a
russian
detachment
under
the
leadership
of
hun
boldon
and
colonel
domojiroff
from
urga
had
pillaged
some
chinese
firms
and
killed
the
merchants
had
come
to
the
monastery
and
demanded
horses
food
and
shelter
the
hutuktu
asked
for
help
because
the
ferocious
conqueror
of
kobdo
hun
boldon
could
very
easily
pillage
the
unprotected
isolated
monastery
we
strongly
urged
colonel
michailoff
not
to
violate
the
sealed
treaty
and
discountenance
all
the
foreigners
and
russians
who
had
taken
part
in
making
it
for
this
would
but
be
to
imitate
the
bolshevik
principle
of
making
deceit
the
leading
rule
in
all
acts
of
state
this
touched
michailoff
and
he
answered
domojiroff
that
uliassutai
was
already
in
his
hands
without
a
fight
that
over
the
building
of
the
former
russian
consulate
the
flag
of
russia
was
flying
the
gamins
had
been
disarmed
but
that
the
other
orders
could
not
be
carried
out
because
their
execution
would
violate
the
treaty
just
signed
in
uliassutai
daily
several
envoys
traveled
from
narabanchi
hutuktu
to
uliassutai
the
news
became
more
and
more
disquieting
the
hutuktu
reported
that
hun
boldon
was
mobilizing
the
mongolian
beggars
and
horse
stealers
arming
and
training
them
that
the
soldiers
were
taking
the
sheep
of
the
monastery
that
the
noyon
domojiroff
was
always
drunk
and
that
the
protests
of
the
hutuktu
were
answered
with
jeers
and
scolding
the
messengers
gave
very
indefinite
information
regarding
the
strength
of
the
detachment
some
placing
it
at
about
thirty
while
others
stated
that
domojiroff
said
he
had
eight
hundred
in
all
we
could
not
understand
it
at
all
and
soon
the
messengers
ceased
coming
all
the
letters
of
the
sait
remained
unanswered
and
the
envoys
did
not
return
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
men
had
been
killed
or
captured
prince
chultun
beyli
determined
to
go
himself
he
took
with
him
the
russian
and
chinese
presidents
of
the
chambers
of
commerce
and
two
mongolian
officers
three
days
elapsed
without
receiving
any
news
from
him
whatever
the
mongols
began
to
get
worried
then
the
chinese
commissioner
and
hun
jap
lama
addressed
a
request
to
the
foreigner
group
to
send
some
one
to
narabanchi
in
order
to
try
to
resolve
the
controversy
there
and
to
persuade
domojiroff
to
recognize
the
treaty
and
not
permit
the
great
insult
of
violation
of
a
covenant
between
the
two
great
peoples
our
group
asked
me
once
more
to
accomplish
this
mission
pro
bono
publico
i
had
assigned
me
as
interpreter
a
fine
young
russian
colonist
the
nephew
of
the
murdered
bobroff
a
splendid
rider
as
well
as
a
cool
brave
man
michailoff
gave
me
one
of
his
officers
to
accompany
me
supplied
with
an
express
tzara
for
the
post
horses
and
guides
we
traveled
rapidly
over
the
way
which
was
now
familiar
to
me
to
find
my
old
friend
jelib
djamsrap
huktuktu
of
narabanchi
although
there
was
deep
snow
in
some
places
we
made
from
one
hundred
to
one
hundred
and
fifteen
miles
per
day
chapter
xxvi
the
band
of
white
hunghutzes
we
arrived
at
narabanchi
late
at
night
on
the
third
day
out
as
we
were
approaching
we
noticed
several
riders
who
as
soon
as
they
had
seen
us
galloped
quickly
back
to
the
monastery
for
some
time
we
looked
for
the
camp
of
the
russian
detachment
without
finding
it
the
mongols
led
us
into
the
monastery
where
the
hutuktu
immediately
received
me
in
his
yurta
sat
chultun
beyli
there
he
presented
me
with
hatyks
and
said
to
me
the
very
god
has
sent
you
here
to
us
in
this
difficult
it
seems
domojiroff
had
arrested
both
the
presidents
of
the
chambers
of
commerce
and
had
threatened
to
shoot
prince
chultun
both
domojiroff
and
hun
boldon
had
no
documents
legalizing
their
activities
chultun
beyli
was
preparing
to
fight
with
them
i
asked
them
to
take
me
to
domojiroff
through
the
dark
i
saw
four
big
yurtas
and
two
mongol
sentinels
with
russian
rifles
we
entered
the
russian
noyon
s
tent
a
very
strange
picture
was
presented
to
our
eyes
in
the
middle
of
the
yurta
the
brazier
was
burning
in
the
usual
place
for
the
altar
stood
a
throne
on
which
the
tall
thin
colonel
domojiroff
was
seated
he
was
only
in
his
undergarments
and
stockings
was
evidently
a
little
drunk
and
was
telling
stories
around
the
brazier
lay
twelve
young
men
in
various
picturesque
poses
my
officer
companion
reported
to
domojiroff
about
the
events
in
uliassutai
and
during
the
conversation
i
asked
domojiroff
where
his
detachment
was
encamped
he
laughed
and
answered
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
this
is
my
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
form
of
his
orders
to
us
in
uliassutai
had
led
us
to
believe
that
he
must
have
a
large
company
with
him
then
i
informed
him
that
michailoff
was
preparing
to
cross
swords
with
the
bolshevik
force
approaching
uliassutai
what
he
exclaimed
with
fear
and
confusion
the
reds
we
spent
the
night
in
his
yurta
and
when
i
was
ready
to
lie
down
my
officer
whispered
to
me
be
sure
to
keep
your
revolver
handy
to
which
i
laughed
and
said
but
we
are
in
the
center
of
a
white
detachment
and
therefore
in
perfect
safety
answered
my
officer
and
finished
the
response
with
one
eye
closed
the
next
day
i
invited
domojiroff
to
walk
with
me
over
the
plain
when
i
talked
very
frankly
with
him
about
what
had
been
happening
he
and
hun
boldon
had
received
orders
from
baron
ungern
simply
to
get
into
touch
with
general
bakitch
but
instead
they
began
pillaging
chinese
firms
along
the
route
and
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
become
a
great
conqueror
on
the
way
he
had
run
across
some
of
the
officers
who
deserted
colonel
kazagrandi
and
formed
his
present
band
i
succeeded
in
persuading
domojiroff
to
arrange
matters
peacefully
with
chultun
beyli
and
not
to
violate
the
treaty
he
immediately
went
ahead
to
the
monastery
as
i
returned
i
met
a
tall
mongol
with
a
ferocious
face
dressed
in
a
blue
silk
outercoat
it
was
hun
boldon
he
introduced
himself
and
spoke
with
me
in
russian
i
had
only
time
to
take
off
my
coat
in
the
tent
of
domojiroff
when
a
mongol
came
running
to
invite
me
to
the
yurta
of
hun
boldon
the
prince
lived
just
beside
me
in
a
splendid
blue
yurta
knowing
the
mongolian
custom
i
jumped
into
the
saddle
and
rode
the
ten
paces
to
his
door
hun
boldon
received
me
with
coldness
and
pride
who
is
he
he
inquired
of
the
interpreter
pointing
to
me
with
his
finger
i
understood
his
desire
to
offend
me
and
i
answered
in
the
same
manner
thrusting
out
my
finger
toward
him
and
turning
to
the
interpreter
with
the
same
question
in
a
slightly
more
unpleasant
tone
who
is
he
high
prince
and
warrior
or
shepherd
and
brute
boldon
at
once
became
confused
and
with
trembling
voice
and
agitation
in
his
whole
manner
blurted
out
to
me
that
he
would
not
allow
me
to
interfere
in
his
affairs
and
would
shoot
every
man
who
dared
to
run
counter
to
his
orders
he
pounded
on
the
low
table
with
his
fist
and
then
rose
up
and
drew
his
revolver
but
i
was
much
traveled
among
the
nomads
and
had
studied
them
thoroughly
princes
lamas
shepherds
and
brigands
i
grasped
my
whip
and
striking
it
on
the
table
with
all
my
strength
i
said
to
the
interpreter
tell
him
that
he
has
the
honor
to
speak
with
neither
mongol
nor
russian
but
with
a
foreigner
a
citizen
of
a
great
and
free
state
tell
him
he
must
first
learn
to
be
a
man
and
then
he
can
visit
me
and
we
can
talk
i
turned
and
went
out
ten
minutes
later
hun
boldon
entered
my
yurta
and
offered
his
apologies
i
persuaded
him
to
parley
with
chultun
beyli
and
not
to
offend
the
free
mongol
people
with
his
activities
that
very
night
all
was
arranged
hun
boldon
dismissed
his
mongols
and
left
for
kobdo
while
domojiroff
with
his
band
started
for
jassaktu
khan
to
arrange
for
the
mobilization
of
the
mongols
there
with
the
consent
of
chultun
beyli
he
wrote
to
wang
a
demand
to
disarm
his
guard
as
all
of
the
chinese
troops
in
urga
had
been
so
treated
but
this
letter
arrived
after
wang
had
bought
camels
to
replace
the
stolen
horses
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
border
later
michailoff
sent
a
detachment
of
fifty
men
under
the
command
of

and
i
were
ready
to
leave
the
narabanchi
kure
while
the
hutuktu
was
holding
service
for
the
sait
in
the
temple
of
blessing
i
wandered
around
through
the
narrow
alleyways
between
the
walls
of
the
houses
of
the
various
grades
of
lama
gelongs
getuls

or

of
the
residences
for

of

and

when
i
returned
to
the
yurta
of
the
hutuktu
he
was
inside
he
presented
me
with
a
large
hatyk
and
proposed
a
walk
around
the
monastery
his
face
wore
a
preoccupied
expression
from
which
i
gathered
that
he
had
something
he
wished
to
discuss
with
me
as
we
went
out
of
the
yurta
the
liberated
president
of
the
russian
chamber
of
commerce
and
a
russian
officer
joined
us
the
hutuktu
led
us
to
a
small
building
just
back
of
a
bright
yellow
stone
wall
in
that
building
once
stopped
the
dalai
lama
and
bogdo
khan
and
we
always
paint
the
buildings

where
these
holy
persons
have
lived
enter
the
interior
of
the
building
was
arranged
with
splendor
on
the
ground
floor
was
the
furnished
with
richly
carved
heavy
blackwood
chinese
tables
and
cabinets
filled
with
porcelains
and
bronze
above
were
two
rooms
the
first
a
hung
with
heavy
yellow
silk
curtains
a
large
chinese
lantern
richly
set
with
colored
stones
hung
by
a
thin
bronze
chain
from
the
carved
wooden
ceiling
beam
here
stood
a
large
square
bed
covered
with
silken
pillows
mattresses
and
blankets
the
frame
work
of
the
bed
was
also
of
the
chinese
blackwood
and
carried
especially
on
the
posts
that
held
the
canopy
finely
executed
carvings
with
the
chief
motive
the
conventional
dragon
devouring
the
sun
by
the
side
stood
a
chest
of
drawers
completely
covered
with
carvings
setting
forth
religious
pictures
four
comfortable
easy
chairs
completed
the
furniture
save
for
the
low
oriental
throne
which
stood
on
a
dais
at
the
end
of
the
room
do
you
see
this
throne
said
the
hutuktu
to
me
one
night
in
winter
several
horsemen
rode
into
the
monastery
and
demanded
that
all
the
gelongs
and
getuls
with
the
hutuktu
and
kanpo
at
their
head
should
congregate
in
this
room
then
one
of
the
strangers
mounted
the
throne
where
he
took
off
his
bashlyk
or
head
covering
all
of
the
lamas
fell
to
their
knees
as
they
recognized
the
man
who
had
been
long
ago
described
in
the
sacred
bulls
of
dalai
lama
tashi
lama
and
bogdo
khan
he
was
the
man
to
whom
the
whole
world
belongs
and
who
has
penetrated
into
all
the
mysteries
of
nature
he
pronounced
a
short
tibetan
prayer
blessed
all
his
hearers
and
afterwards
made
predictions
for
the
coming
half
century
this
was
thirty
years
ago
and
in
the
interim
all
his
prophecies
are
being
fulfilled
during
his
prayers
before
that
small
shrine
in
the
next
room
this
door
opened
of
its
own
accord
the
candles
and
lights
before
the
altar
lighted
themselves
and
the
sacred
braziers
without
coals
gave
forth
great
streams
of
incense
that
filled
the
room
and
then
without
warning
the
king
of
the
world
and
his
companions
disappeared
from
among
us
behind
him
remained
no
trace
save
the
folds
in
the
silken
throne
coverings
which
smoothed
themselves
out
and
left
the
throne
as
though
no
one
had
sat
upon
the
hutuktu
entered
the
shrine
kneeled
down
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
began
to
pray
i
looked
at
the
calm
indifferent
face
of
the
golden
buddha
over
which
the
flickering
lamps
threw
changing
shadows
and
then
turned
my
eyes
to
the
side
of
the
throne
it
was
wonderful
and
difficult
to
believe
but
i
really
saw
there
the
strong
muscular
figure
of
a
man
with
a
swarthy
face
of
stern
and
fixed
expression
about
the
mouth
and
jaws
thrown
into
high
relief
by
the
brightness
of
the
eyes
through
his
transparent
body
draped
in
white
raiment
i
saw
the
tibetan
inscriptions
on
the
back
of
the
throne
i
closed
my
eyes
and
opened
them
again
no
one
was
there
but
the
silk
throne
covering
seemed
to
be
moving
nervousness
i
thought
abnormal
and
impressionability
growing
out
of
the
unusual
surroundings
and
the
hutuktu
turned
to
me
and
said
give
me
your
hatyk
i
have
the
feeling
that
you
are
troubled
about
those
whom
you
love
and
i
want
to
pray
for
them
and
you
must
pray
also
importune
god
and
direct
the
sight
of
your
soul
to
the
king
of
the
world
who
was
here
and
sanctified
this
the
hutuktu
placed
the
hatyk
on
the
shoulder
of
the
buddha
and
prostrating
himself
on
the
carpet
before
the
altar
whispered
the
words
of
prayer
then
he
raised
his
head
and
beckoned
me
to
him
with
a
slight
movement
of
his
hand
look
at
the
dark
space
behind
the
statue
of
buddha
and
he
will
show
your
beloved
to
readily
obeying
his
command
i
began
to
look
into
the
dark
niche
behind
the
figure
of
the
buddha
soon
out
of
the
darkness
began
to
appear
streams
of
smoke
or
transparent
threads
they
floated
in
the
air
becoming
more
and
more
dense
and
increasing
in
number
until
gradually
they
formed
the
bodies
of
several
persons
and
the
outlines
of
various
objects
i
saw
a
room
that
was
strange
to
me
with
my
family
there
surrounded
by
some
whom
i
knew
and
others
whom
i
did
not
i
recognized
even
the
dress
my
wife
wore
every
line
of
her
dear
face
was
clearly
visible
gradually
the
vision
became
too
dark
dissipated
itself
into
the
streams
of
smoke
and
transparent
threads
and
disappeared
behind
the
golden
buddha
was
nothing
but
the
darkness
the
hutuktu
arose
took
my
hatyk
from
the
shoulder
of
the
buddha
and
handed
it
to
me
with
these
words
fortune
is
always
with
you
and
with
your
family
god
s
goodness
will
not
forsake
we
left
the
building
of
this
unknown
king
of
the
world
where
he
had
prayed
for
all
mankind
and
had
predicted
the
fate
of
peoples
and
states
i
was
greatly
astonished
to
find
that
my
companions
had
also
seen
my
vision
and
to
hear
them
describe
to
me
in
minute
detail
the
appearance
and
the
clothes
of
the
persons
whom
i
had
seen
in
the
dark
niche
behind
the
head
of
buddha
in
order
that
i
might
have
the
evidence
of
others
on
this
extraordinarily
impressive
vision
i
asked
them
to
make
protocols
or
affidavits
concerning
what
they
saw
this
they
did
and
i
now
have
these
statements
in
my
possession
the
mongol
officer
also
told
me
that
chultun
beyli
had
the
day
before
asked
the
hutuktu
to
reveal
to
him
his
fate
in
this
important
juncture
of
his
life
and
in
this
crisis
of
his
country
but
the
hutuktu
only
waved
his
hand
in
an
expression
of
fear
and
refused
when
i
asked
the
hutuktu
for
the
reason
of
his
refusal
suggesting
to
him
that
it
might
calm
and
help
chultun
beyli
as
the
vision
of
my
beloved
had
strengthened
me
the
hutuktu
knitted
his
brow
and
answered
no
the
vision
would
not
please
the
prince
his
fate
is
black
yesterday
i
thrice
sought
his
fortune
on
the
burned
shoulder
blades
and
with
the
entrails
of
sheep
and
each
time
came
to
the
same
dire
result
the
same
dire
result
he
did
not
really
finish
speaking
but
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
in
fear
he
was
convinced
that
the
lot
of
chultun
beyli
was
black
as
the
night
in
an
hour
we
were
behind
the
low
hills
that
hid
the
narabanchi
kure
from
our
sight
chapter
xxviii
the
breath
of
death
we
arrived
at
uliassutai
on
the
day
of
the
return
of
the
detachment
which
had
gone
out
to
disarm
the
convoy
of
wang
this
detachment
had
met
colonel
domojiroff
who
ordered
them
not
only
to
disarm
but
to
pillage
the
convoy
and
unfortunately
lieutenant
strigine
executed
this
illegal
and
unwarranted
command
it
was
compromising
and
ignominious
to
see
russian
officers
and
soldiers
wearing
the
chinese
overcoats
boots
and
wrist
watches
which
had
been
taken
from
the
chinese
officials
and
the
convoy
everyone
had
chinese
silver
and
gold
also
from
the
loot
the
mongol
wife
of
wang
and
her
brother
returned
with
the
detachment
and
entered
a
complaint
of
having
been
robbed
by
the
russians
the
chinese
officials
and
their
convoy
deprived
of
their
supplies
reached
the
chinese
border
only
after
great
distress
from
hunger
and
cold
we
foreigners
were
astounded
that
michailoff
received
strigine
with
military
honors
but
we
caught
the
explanation
of
it
later
when
we
learned
that
michailoff
had
been
given
some
of
the
chinese
silver
and
his
wife
the
handsomely
decorated
saddle
of
fu
hsiang
chultun
beyli
demanded
that
all
the
weapons
taken
from
the
chinese
and
all
the
stolen
property
be
turned
over
to
him
as
it
must
later
be
returned
to
the
chinese
authorities
but
michailoff
refused
afterwards
we
foreigners
cut
off
all
contact
with
the
russian
detachment
the
relations
between
the
russians
and
mongols
became
very
strained
several
of
the
russian
officers
protested
against
the
acts
of
michailoff
and
strigine
and
controversies
became
more
and
more
serious
at
this
time
one
morning
in
april
an
extraordinary
group
of
armed
horsemen
arrived
at
uliassutai
they
stayed
at
the
house
of
the
bolshevik
bourdukoff
who
gave
them
so
we
were
told
a
great
quantity
of
silver
this
group
explained
that
they
were
former
officers
in
the
imperial
guard
they
were
colonels
poletika
philipoff
and
three
of
the
latter
s
brothers
they
announced
that
they
wanted
to
collect
all
the
white
officers
and
soldiers
then
in
mongolia
and
china
and
lead
them
to
urianhai
to
fight
the
bolsheviki
but
that
first
they
wanted
to
wipe
out
ungern
and
return
mongolia
to
china
they
called
themselves
the
representatives
of
the
central
organization
of
the
whites
in
russia
the
society
of
russian
officers
in
uliassutai
invited
them
to
a
meeting
examined
their
documents
and
interrogated
them
investigation
proved
that
all
the
statements
of
these
officers
about
their
former
connections
were
entirely
wrong
that
poletika
occupied
an
important
position
in
the
war
commissariat
of
the
bolsheviki
that
one
of
the
philipoff
brothers
was
the
assistant
of
kameneff
in
his
first
attempt
to
reach
england
that
the
central
white
organization
in
russia
did
not
exist
that
the
proposed
fighting
in
urianhai
was
but
a
trap
for
the
white
officers
and
that
this
group
was
in
close
relations
with
the
bolshevik
bourdukoff
a
discussion
at
once
sprang
up
among
the
officers
as
to
what
they
should
do
with
this
group
which
split
the
detachment
into
two
distinct
parties
michailoff
with
several
officers
joined
themselves
to
poletika
s
group
just
as
colonel
domojiroff
arrived
with
his
detachment
he
began
to
get
in
touch
with
both
factions
and
to
feel
out
the
politics
of
the
situation
finally
appointing
poletika
to
the
post
of
commandant
of
uliassutai
and
sending
to
baron
ungern
a
full
report
of
the
events
in
the
town
in
this
document
he
devoted
much
space
to
me
accusing
me
of
standing
in
the
way
of
the
execution
of
his
orders
his
officers
watched
me
continuously
from
different
quarters
i
received
warnings
to
take
great
care
this
band
and
its
leader
openly
demanded
to
know
what
right
this
foreigner
had
to
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
mongolia
one
of
domojiroff
s
officers
directly
giving
me
the
challenge
in
a
meeting
in
the
attempt
to
provoke
a
controversy
i
quietly
answered
him
and
on
what
basis
do
the
russian
refugees
interfere
they
who
have
rights
neither
at
home
nor
abroad
the
officer
made
no
verbal
reply
but
in
his
eyes
burned
a
definite
answer
my
huge
friend
who
sat
beside
me
noticed
this
strode
over
toward
him
and
towering
over
him
stretched
his
arms
and
hands
as
though
just
waking
from
sleep
and
remarked
i
m
looking
for
a
little
boxing
on
one
occasion
domojiroff
s
men
would
have
succeeded
in
taking
me
if
i
had
not
been
saved
by
the
watchfulness
of
our
foreign
group
i
had
gone
to
the
fortress
to
negotiate
with
the
mongol
sait
for
the
departure
of
the
foreigners
from
uliassutai
chultun
beyli
detained
me
for
a
long
time
so
that
i
was
forced
to
return
about
nine
in
the
evening
my
horse
was
walking
half
a
mile
from
the
town
three
men
sprang
up
out
of
the
ditch
and
ran
at
me
i
whipped
up
my
horse
but
noticed
several
more
men
coming
out
of
the
other
ditch
as
though
to
head
me
off
they
however
made
for
the
other
group
and
captured
them
and
i
heard
the
voice
of
a
foreigner
calling
me
back
there
i
found
three
of
domojiroff
s
officers
surrounded
by
the
polish
soldiers
and
other
foreigners
under
the
leadership
of
my
old
trusted
agronome
who
was
occupied
with
tying
the
hands
of
the
officers
behind
their
backs
so
strongly
that
the
bones
cracked
ending
his
work
and
still
smoking
his
perpetual
pipe
he
announced
in
a
serious
and
important
manner
i
think
it
best
to
throw
them
into
the
laughing
at
his
seriousness
and
the
fear
of
domojiroff
s
officers
i
asked
them
why
they
had
started
to
attack
me
they
dropped
their
eyes
and
were
silent
it
was
an
eloquent
silence
and
we
perfectly
understood
what
they
had
proposed
to
do
they
had
revolvers
hidden
in
their
pockets
fine
i
said
all
is
perfectly
clear
i
shall
release
you
but
you
must
report
to
your
sender
that
he
will
not
welcome
you
back
the
next
time
your
weapons
i
shall
hand
to
the
commandant
of
my
friend
using
his
former
terrifying
care
began
to
untie
them
repeating
over
and
over
and
i
would
have
fed
you
to
the
fishes
in
the
river
then
we
all
returned
to
the
town
leaving
them
to
go
their
way
domojiroff
continued
to
send
envoys
to
baron
ungern
at
urga
with
requests
for
plenary
powers
and
money
and
with
reports
about
michailoff
chultun
beyli
poletika
philipoff
and
myself
with
asiatic
cunning
he
was
then
maintaining
good
relations
with
all
those
for
whom
he
was
preparing
death
at
the
hands
of
the
severe
warrior
baron
ungern
who
was
receiving
only
reports
about
all
the
happenings
in
uliassutai
our
whole
colony
was
greatly
agitated
the
officers
split
into
different
parties
the
soldiers
collected
in
groups
and
discussed
the
events
of
the
day
criticising
their
chiefs
and
under
the
influence
of
some
of
domojiroff
s
men
began
making
such
statements
as
we
have
now
seven
colonels
who
all
want
to
be
in
command
and
are
all
quarreling
among
themselves
they
all
ought
to
be
pegged
down
and
given
good
sound
thrashings
the
one
who
could
take
the
greatest
number
of
blows
ought
to
be
chosen
as
our
it
was
an
ominous
joke
that
proved
the
demoralization
of
the
russian
detachment
it
seems
my
friend
frequently
observed
that
we
shall
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
council
of
soldiers
here
in
uliassutai
god
and
the
devil
one
thing
here
is
very
unfortunate
there
are
no
forests
near
into
which
good
christian
men
may
dive
and
get
away
from
all
these
cursed
soviets
it
s
bare
frightfully
bare
this
wretched
mongolia
with
no
place
for
us
to
really
this
possibility
of
the
soviet
was
approaching
on
one
occasion
the
soldiers
captured
the
arsenal
containing
the
weapons
surrendered
by
the
chinese
and
carried
them
off
to
their
barracks
drunkenness
gambling
and
fighting
increased
we
foreigners
carefully
watching
events
and
in
fear
of
a
catastrophe
finally
decided
to
leave
uliassutai
that
caldron
of
passions
controversies
and
denunciations
we
heard
that
the
group
of
poletika
was
also
preparing
to
get
out
a
few
days
later
we
foreigners
separated
into
two
parties
one
traveling
by
the
old
caravan
route
across
the
gobi
considerably
to
the
south
of
urga
to
or
kweihuacheng
and
kalgan
and
mine
consisting
of
my
friend
two
polish
soldiers
and
myself
heading
for
urga
via
zain
shabi
where
colonel
kazagrandi
had
asked
me
in
a
recent
letter
to
meet
him
thus
we
left
the
uliassutai
where
we
had
lived
through
so
many
exciting
events
on
the
sixth
day
after
our
departure
there
arrived
in
the
town
the
detachment
under
the
command
of
the
buriat
vandaloff
and
the
russian
captain
bezrodnoff
afterwards
i
met
them
in
zain
shabi
it
was
a
detachment
sent
out
from
urga
by
baron
ungern
to
restore
order
in
uliassutai
and
to
march
on
to
kobdo
on
the
way
from
zain
shabi
bezrodnoff
came
across
the
group
of
poletika
and
michailoff
he
instituted
a
search
which
disclosed
suspicious
documents
in
their
baggage
and
in
that
of
michailoff
and
his
wife
the
silver
and
other
possessions
taken
from
the
chinese
from
this
group
of
sixteen
he
sent
philipoff
to
baron
ungern
released
three
others
and
shot
the
remaining
twelve
thus
ended
in
zain
shabi
the
life
of
one
party
of
uliassutai
refugees
and
the
activities
of
the
group
of
poletika
in
uliassutai
bezrodnoff
shot
chultun
beyli
for
the
violation
of
the
treaty
with
the
chinese
and
also
some
bolshevist
russian
colonists
arrested
domojiroff
and
sent
him
to
urga
and
restored
order
the
predictions
about
chultun
beyli
were
fulfilled
i
knew
of
domojiroff
s
reports
regarding
myself
but
i
decided
nevertheless
to
proceed
to
urga
and
not
to
swing
round
it
as
poletika
had
started
to
do
when
he
was
accidentally
captured
by
bezrodnoff
i
was
accustomed
now
to
looking
into
the
eyes
of
danger
and
i
set
out
to
meet
the
terrible
bloody
no
one
can
decide
his
own
fate
i
did
not
think
myself
in
the
wrong
and
the
feeling
of
fear
had
long
since
ceased
to
occupy
a
place
in
my
menage
on
the
way
a
mongol
rider
who
overhauled
us
brought
the
news
of
the
death
of
our
acquaintances
at
zain
shabi
he
spent
the
night
with
me
in
the
yurta
at
the
ourton
and
related
to
me
the
following
legend
of
death
it
was
a
long
time
ago
when
the
mongolians
ruled
over
china
the
prince
of
uliassutai
beltis
van
was
mad
he
executed
any
one
he
wished
without
trial
and
no
one
dared
to
pass
through
his
town
all
the
other
princes
and
rich
mongols
surrounded
uliassutai
where
beltis
raged
cut
off
communication
on
every
road
and
allowed
none
to
pass
in
or
out
famine
developed
in
the
town
they
consumed
all
the
oxen
sheep
and
horses
and
finally
beltis
van
determined
to
make
a
dash
with
his
soldiers
through
to
the
west
to
the
land
of
one
of
his
tribes
the
olets
he
and
his
men
all
perished
in
the
fight
the
princes
following
the
advice
of
the
hutuktu
buyantu
buried
the
dead
on
the
slopes
of
the
mountains
surrounding
uliassutai
they
buried
them
with
incantations
and
exorcisings
in
order
that
death
by
violence
might
be
kept
from
a
further
visitation
to
their
land
the
tombs
were
covered
with
heavy
stones
and
the
hutuktu
predicted
that
the
bad
demon
of
death
by
violence
would
only
leave
the
earth
when
the
blood
of
a
man
should
be
spilled
upon
the
covering
stone
such
a
legend
lived
among
us
now
it
is
fulfilled
the
russians
shot
there
three
bolsheviki
and
the
chinese
two
mongols
the
evil
spirit
of
beltis
van
broke
loose
from
beneath
the
heavy
stone
and
now
mows
down
the
people
with
his
scythe
the
noble
chultun
beyli
has
perished
the
russian
noyon
michailoff
also
has
fallen
and
death
has
flowed
out
from
uliassutai
all
over
our
boundless
plains
who
shall
be
able
to
stem
it
now
who
shall
tie
the
ferocious
hands
an
evil
time
has
fallen
upon
the
gods
and
the
good
spirits
the
evil
demons
have
made
war
upon
the
good
spirits
what
can
man
now
do
only
perish
only
perish

chapter
xxix
on
the
road
of
great
conquerors
the
great
conqueror
jenghiz
khan
the
son
of
sad
stern
severe
mongolia
according
to
an
old
mongolian
legend
mounted
to
the
top
of
karasu
togol
and
with
his
eyes
of
an
eagle
looked
to
the
west
and
the
east
in
the
west
he
saw
whole
seas
of
human
blood
over
which
floated
a
bloody
fog
that
blanketed
all
the
horizon
there
he
could
not
discern
his
fate
but
the
gods
ordered
him
to
proceed
to
the
west
leading
with
him
all
his
warriors
and
mongolian
tribes
to
the
east
he
saw
wealthy
towns
shining
temples
crowds
of
happy
people
gardens
and
fields
of
rich
earth
all
of
which
pleased
the
great
mongol
he
said
to
his
sons
there
in
the
west
i
shall
be
fire
and
sword
destroyer
avenging
fate
in
the
east
i
shall
come
as
the
merciful
great
builder
bringing
happiness
to
the
people
and
to
the
thus
runs
the
legend
i
found
much
of
truth
in
it
i
had
passed
over
much
of
his
road
to
the
west
and
always
identified
it
by
the
old
tombs
and
the
impertinent
monuments
of
stone
to
the
merciless
conqueror
i
saw
also
a
part
of
the
eastern
road
of
the
hero
over
which
he
traveled
to
china
once
when
we
were
making
a
trip
out
of
uliassutai
we
stopped
the
night
in
djirgalantu
the
old
host
of
the
ourton
knowing
me
from
my
previous
trip
to
narabanchi
welcomed
us
very
kindly
and
regaled
us
with
stories
during
our
evening
meal
among
other
things
he
led
us
out
of
the
yurta
and
pointed
out
a
mountain
peak
brightly
lighted
by
the
full
moon
and
recounted
to
us
the
story
of
one
of
the
sons
of
jenghiz
afterwards
emperor
of
china
and
mongolia
who
had
been
attracted
by
the
beautiful
scenery
and
grazing
lands
of
djirgalantu
and
had
founded
here
a
town
this
was
soon
left
without
inhabitants
for
the
mongol
is
a
nomad
who
can
not
live
in
artificial
cities
the
plain
is
his
house
and
the
world
his
town
for
a
time
this
town
witnessed
battles
between
the
chinese
and
the
troops
of
jenghiz
khan
but
afterwards
it
was
forgotten
at
present
there
remains
only
a
tower
from
which
in
the
early
days
the
heavy
rocks
were
hurled
down
upon
the
heads
of
the
enemy
and
the
dilapidated
gate
of
kublai
the
grandson
of
jenghiz
khan
against
the
greenish
sky
drenched
with
the
rays
of
the
moon
stood
out
the
jagged
line
of
the
mountains
and
the
black
silhouette
of
the
tower
with
its
loopholes
through
which
the
alternate
scudding
clouds
and
light
flashed
when
our
party
left
uliassutai
we
traveled
on
leisurely
making
to
fifty
miles
a
day
until
we
were
within
sixty
miles
of
zain
shabi
where
i
took
leave
of
the
others
to
go
south
to
this
place
in
order
to
keep
my
engagement
with
colonel
kazagrandi
the
sun
had
just
risen
as
my
single
mongol
guide
and
i
without
any
pack
animals
began
to
ascend
the
low
timbered
ridges
from
the
top
of
which
i
caught
the
last
glimpses
of
my
companions
disappearing
down
the
valley
i
had
no
idea
then
of
the
many
and
almost
fatal
dangers
which
i
should
have
to
pass
through
during
this
trip
by
myself
which
was
destined
to
prove
much
longer
than
i
had
anticipated
as
we
were
crossing
a
small
river
with
sandy
shores
my
mongol
guide
told
me
how
the
mongolians
came
there
during
the
summer
to
wash
gold
in
spite
of
the
prohibitions
of
the
lamas
the
manner
of
working
the
placer
was
very
primitive
but
the
results
testified
clearly
to
the
richness
of
these
sands
the
mongol
lies
flat
on
the
ground
brushes
the
sand
aside
with
a
feather
and
keeps
blowing
into
the
little
excavation
so
formed
from
time
to
time
he
wets
his
finger
and
picks
up
on
it
a
small
bit
of
grain
gold
or
a
diminutive
nugget
and
drops
these
into
a
little
bag
hanging
under
his
chin
in
such
manner
this
primitive
dredge
wins
about
a
quarter
of
an
ounce
or
five
dollars
worth
of
the
yellow
metal
per
day
i
determined
to
make
the
whole
distance
to
zain
shabi
in
a
single
day
at
the
ourtons
i
hurried
them
through
the
catching
and
saddling
of
the
horses
as
fast
as
i
could
at
one
of
these
stations
about
miles
from
the
monastery
the
mongols
gave
me
a
wild
horse
a
big
strong
white
stallion
just
as
i
was
about
to
mount
him
and
had
already
touched
my
foot
to
the
stirrup
he
jumped
and
kicked
me
right
on
the
leg
which
had
been
wounded
in
the
fight
the
leg
soon
began
to
swell
and
ache
at
sunset
i
made
out
the
first
russian
and
chinese
buildings
and
later
the
monastery
at
zain
we
dropped
into
the
valley
of
a
small
stream
which
flowed
along
a
mountain
on
whose
peak
were
set
white
rocks
forming
the
words
of
a
tibetan
prayer
at
the
bottom
of
this
mountain
was
a
cemetery
for
the
lamas
that
is
piles
of
bones
and
a
pack
of
dogs
at
last
the
monastery
lay
right
below
us
a
common
square
surrounded
with
wooden
fences
in
the
middle
rose
a
large
temple
quite
different
from
all
those
of
western
mongolia
not
in
the
chinese
but
in
the
tibetan
style
of
architecture
a
white
building
with
perpendicular
walls
and
regular
rows
of
windows
in
black
frames
with
a
roof
of
black
tiles
and
with
a
most
unusual
damp
course
laid
between
the
stone
walls
and
the
roof
timbers
and
made
of
bundles
of
twigs
from
a
tibetan
tree
which
never
rots
another
small
quadrangle
lay
a
little
to
the
east
and
contained
russian
buildings
connected
with
the
monastery
by
telephone
that
is
the
house
of
the
living
god
of
zain
the
mongol
explained
pointing
to
this
smaller
quadrangle
he
likes
russian
customs
and
to
the
north
on
a
hill
rose
a
tower
that
recalled
the
babylonian
zikkurat
it
was
the
temple
where
the
ancient
books
and
manuscripts
were
kept
and
the
broken
ornaments
and
objects
used
in
the
religious
ceremonies
together
with
the
robes
of
deceased
hutuktus
preserved
a
sheer
cliff
rose
behind
this
museum
which
it
was
impossible
for
one
to
climb
on
the
face
of
this
were
carved
images
of
the
lamaite
gods
scattered
about
without
any
special
order
they
were
from
one
to
two
and
a
half
metres
high
at
night
the
monks
lighted
lamps
before
them
so
that
one
could
see
these
images
of
the
gods
and
goddesses
from
far
away
we
entered
the
trading
settlement
the
streets
were
deserted
and
from
the
windows
only
women
and
children
looked
out
i
stopped
with
a
russian
firm
whose
other
branches
i
had
known
throughout
the
country
much
to
my
astonishment
they
welcomed
me
as
an
acquaintance
it
appeared
that
the
hutuktu
of
narabanchi
had
sent
word
to
all
the
monasteries
that
whenever
i
should
come
they
must
all
render
me
aid
inasmuch
as
i
had
saved
the
narabanchi
monastery
and
by
the
clear
signs
of
the
divinations
i
was
an
incarnate
buddha
beloved
of
the
gods
this
letter
of
this
kindly
disposed
hutuktu
helped
me
very
much
perhaps
i
should
even
say
more
that
it
saved
me
from
death
the
hospitality
of
my
hosts
proved
of
great
and
much
needed
assistance
to
me
because
my
injured
leg
had
swelled
and
was
aching
severely
when
i
took
off
my
boot
i
found
my
foot
all
covered
with
blood
and
my
old
wound
by
the
blow
a
felcher
was
called
to
assist
me
with
treatment
and
bandaging
so
that
i
was
able
to
walk
again
three
days
later
i
did
not
find
colonel
kazagrandi
at
zain
shabi
after
destroying
the
chinese
gamins
who
had
killed
the
local
commandant
he
had
returned
via
van
kure
the
new
commandment
handed
me
the
letter
of
kazagrandi
who
very
cordially
asked
me
to
visit
him
after
i
had
rested
in
zain
a
mongolian
document
was
enclosed
in
the
letter
giving
me
the
right
to
receive
horses
and
carts
from
herd
to
herd
by
means
of
the
urga
which
i
shall
later
describe
and
which
opened
for
me
an
entirely
new
vista
of
mongolian
life
and
country
that
i
should
otherwise
never
have
seen
the
making
of
this
journey
of
over
two
hundred
miles
was
a
very
disagreeable
task
for
me
but
evidently
kazagrandi
whom
i
had
never
met
had
serious
reasons
for
wishing
this
meeting
at
one
o
clock
the
day
after
my
arrival
i
was
visited
by
the
local
very
god
gheghen
pandita
hutuktu
a
more
strange
and
extraordinary
appearance
of
a
god
i
could
not
imagine
he
was
a
short
thin
young
man
of
twenty
or
years
with
quick
nervous
movements
and
with
an
expressive
face
lighted
and
dominated
like
the
countenances
of
all
the
mongol
gods
by
large
frightened
eyes
he
was
dressed
in
a
blue
silk
russian
uniform
with
yellow
epaulets
with
the
sacred
sign
of
pandita
hutuktu
in
blue
silk
trousers
and
high
boots
all
surmounted
by
a
white
astrakhan
cap
with
a
yellow
pointed
top
at
his
girdle
a
revolver
and
sword
were
slung
i
did
not
know
quite
what
to
think
of
this
disguised
god
he
took
a
cup
of
tea
from
the
host
and
began
to
talk
with
a
mixture
of
mongolian
and
russian
not
far
from
my
kure
is
located
the
ancient
monastery
of
erdeni
dzu
erected
on
the
site
of
the
ruins
of
karakorum
the
ancient
capital
of
jenghiz
khan
and
afterwards
frequently
visited
by
kublai
kahn
for
sanctuary
and
rest
after
his
labors
as
emperor
of
china
india
persia
afghanistan
mongolia
and
half
of
europe
now
only
ruins
and
tombs
remain
to
mark
this
former
garden
of
beatific
the
pious
monks
of
baroun
kure
found
in
the
underground
chambers
of
the
ruins
manuscripts
that
were
much
older
than
erdeni
dzu
itself
in
these
my
maramba
found
the
prediction
that
the
hutuktu
of
zain
who
should
carry
the
title
of
pandita
should
be
but
years
of
age
be
born
in
the
heart
of
the
lands
of
jenghiz
khan
and
have
on
his
chest
the
natural
sign
of
the
swastika
such
hutuktu
would
be
honored
by
the
people
in
the
days
of
a
great
war
and
trouble
would
begin
the
fight
with
the
servants
of
red
evil
and
would
conquer
them
and
bring
order
into
the
universe
celebrating
this
happy
day
in
the
city
with
white
temples
and
with
the
songs
of
ten
thousand
bells
it
is
i
pandita
hutuktu
the
signs
and
symbols
have
met
in
me
i
shall
destroy
the
bolsheviki
the
bad
servants
of
the
red
evil
and
in
moscow
i
shall
rest
from
my
glorious
and
great
work
therefore
i
have
asked
colonel
kazagrandi
to
enlist
me
in
the
troops
of
baron
ungern
and
give
me
the
chance
to
fight
the
lamas
seek
to
prevent
me
from
going
but
who
is
the
god
here
he
very
sternly
stamped
his
foot
while
the
lamas
and
guard
who
accompanied
him
reverently
bowed
their
heads
as
he
left
he
presented
me
with
a
hatyk
and
rummaging
through
my
saddle
bags
i
found
a
single
article
that
might
be
considered
worthy
as
a
gift
for
a
hutuktu
a
small
bottle
of
osmiridium
this
rare
natural
concomitant
of
platinum
this
is
the
most
stable
and
hardest
of
metals
i
said
let
it
be
the
sign
of
your
glory
and
strength
hutuktu
the
pandita
thanked
me
and
invited
me
to
visit
him
when
i
had
recovered
a
little
i
went
to
his
house
which
was
arranged
in
european
style
electric
lights
push
bells
and
telephone
he
feasted
me
with
wine
and
sweets
and
introduced
me
to
two
very
interesting
personages
one
an
old
tibetan
surgeon
with
a
face
deeply
pitted
by
smallpox
a
heavy
thick
nose
and
crossed
eyes
he
was
a
peculiar
surgeon
consecrated
in
tibet
his
duties
consisted
in
treating
and
curing
hutuktus
when
they
were
ill
and
in
poisoning
them
when
they
became
too
independent
or
extravagant
or
when
their
policies
were
not
in
accord
with
the
wishes
of
the
council
of
lamas
of
the
living
buddha
or
the
dalai
lama
by
now
pandita
hutuktu
probably
rests
in
eternal
peace
on
the
top
of
some
sacred
mountain
sent
thither
by
the
solicitude
of
his
extraordinary
court
physician
the
martial
spirit
of
pandita
hutuktu
was
very
unwelcome
to
the
council
of
lamas
who
protested
against
the
adventuresomeness
of
this
living
pandita
liked
wine
and
cards
one
day
when
he
was
in
the
company
of
russians
and
dressed
in
a
european
suit
some
lamas
came
running
to
announce
that
divine
service
had
begun
and
that
the
living
god
must
take
his
place
on
the
altar
to
be
prayed
to
but
he
had
gone
out
from
his
abode
and
was
playing
cards
without
any
confusion
pandita
drew
his
red
mantle
of
the
hutuktu
over
his
european
coat
and
long
grey
trousers
and
allowed
the
shocked
lamas
to
carry
their
god
away
in
his
palanquin
besides
the
i
met
at
the
hutuktu
s
a
lad
of
thirteen
years
whose
youthfulness
red
robe
and
cropped
hair
led
me
to
suppose
he
was
a
bandi
or
student
servant
in
the
home
of
the
hutuktu
but
it
turned
out
otherwise
this
boy
was
the
first
hubilgan
also
an
incarnate
buddha
an
artful
teller
of
fortunes
and
the
successor
of
pandita
hutuktu
he
was
drunk
all
the
time
and
a
great
card
player
always
making
jokes
that
greatly
offended
the
lamas
that
same
evening
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
second
hubilgan
who
called
on
me
the
real
administrator
of
zain
shabi
which
is
an
independent
dominion
subject
directly
to
the
living
buddha
this
hubilgan
was
a
serious
and
ascetic
man
of
well
educated
and
deeply
learned
in
mongol
lore
he
knew
russian
and
read
much
in
that
language
being
interested
chiefly
in
the
life
and
stories
of
other
peoples
he
had
a
high
respect
for
the
creative
genius
of
the
american
people
and
said
to
me
when
you
go
to
america
ask
the
americans
to
come
to
us
and
lead
us
out
from
the
darkness
that
surrounds
us
the
chinese
and
russians
will
lead
us
to
destruction
and
only
the
americans
can
save
it
is
a
deep
satisfaction
for
me
to
carry
out
the
request
of
this
influential
mongol
hubilgan
and
to
urge
his
appeal
to
the
american
people
will
you
not
save
this
honest
uncorrupted
but
dark
deceived
and
oppressed
people
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
perish
for
within
their
souls
they
carry
a
great
store
of
strong
moral
forces
make
of
them
a
cultured
people
believing
in
the
verity
of
humankind
teach
them
to
use
the
wealth
of
their
land
and
the
ancient
people
of
jenghiz
khan
will
ever
be
your
faithful
friends
when
i
had
sufficiently
recovered
the
hutuktu
invited
me
to
travel
with
him
to
erdeni
dzu
to
which
i
willingly
agreed
on
the
following
morning
a
light
and
comfortable
carriage
was
brought
for
me
our
trip
lasted
five
days
during
which
we
visited
erdeni
dzu
karakorum
and
all
these
are
the
ruins
of
monasteries
and
cities
erected
by
jenghiz
khan
and
his
successors
ugadai
khan
and
kublai
in
the
thirteenth
century
now
only
the
remnants
of
walls
and
towers
remain
some
large
tombs
and
whole
books
of
legends
and
stories
look
at
these
tombs
said
the
hutuktu
to
me
here
the
son
of
khan
uyuk
was
buried
this
young
prince
was
bribed
by
the
chinese
to
kill
his
father
but
was
frustrated
in
his
attempt
by
his
own
sister
who
killed
him
in
her
watchful
care
of
her
old
father
the
emperor
and
khan
there
is
the
tomb
of
tsinilla
the
beloved
spouse
of
khan
mangu
she
left
the
capital
of
china
to
go
to
khara
bolgasun
where
she
fell
in
love
with
the
brave
shepherd
damcharen
who
overtook
the
wind
on
his
steed
and
who
captured
wild
yaks
and
horses
with
his
bare
hands
the
enraged
khan
ordered
his
unfaithful
wife
strangled
but
afterwards
buried
her
with
imperial
honors
and
frequently
came
to
her
tomb
to
weep
for
his
lost
and
what
happened
to
damcharen
i
inquired
the
hutuktu
himself
did
not
know
but
his
old
servant
the
real
archive
of
legends
answered
with
the
aid
of
ferocious
chahar
brigands
he
fought
with
china
for
a
long
time
it
is
however
unknown
how
he
among
the
ruins
the
monks
pray
at
certain
fixed
times
and
they
also
search
for
sacred
books
and
objects
concealed
or
buried
in
the
debris
recently
they
found
here
two
chinese
rifles
and
two
gold
rings
and
big
bundles
of
old
manuscripts
tied
with
leather
thongs
why
did
this
region
attract
the
powerful
emperors
and
khans
who
ruled
from
the
pacific
to
the
adriatic
i
asked
myself
certainly
not
these
mountains
and
valleys
covered
with
larch
and
birch
not
these
vast
sands
receding
lakes
and
barren
rocks
it
seems
that
i
found
the
answer
the
great
emperors
remembering
the
vision
of
jenghiz
khan
sought
here
new
revelations
and
predictions
of
his
miraculous
majestic
destiny
surrounded
by
the
divine
honors
obeisance
and
hate
where
could
they
come
into
touch
with
the
gods
the
good
and
bad
spirits
only
there
where
they
abode
all
the
district
of
zain
with
these
ancient
ruins
is
just
such
a
place
on
this
mountain
only
such
men
can
ascend
as
are
born
of
the
direct
line
of
jenghiz
khan
the
pandita
explained
to
me
half
way
up
the
ordinary
man
suffocates
and
dies
if
he
ventures
to
go
further
recently
mongolian
hunters
chased
a
pack
of
wolves
up
this
mountain
and
when
they
came
to
this
part
of
the
mountainside
they
all
perished
there
on
the
slopes
of
the
mountain
lie
the
bones
of
eagles
big
horned
sheep
and
the
kabarga
antelope
light
and
swift
as
the
wind
there
dwells
the
bad
demon
who
possesses
the
book
of
human
this
is
the
answer
i
thought
in
the
western
caucasus
i
once
saw
a
mountain
between
soukhoum
kale
and
tuopsei
where
wolves
eagles
and
wild
goats
also
perish
and
where
men
would
likewise
perish
if
they
did
not
go
on
horseback
through
this
zone
there
the
earth
breathes
out
carbonic
acid
gas
through
holes
in
the
mountainside
killing
all
animal
life
the
gas
clings
to
the
earth
in
a
layer
about
half
a
metre
thick
men
on
horseback
pass
above
this
and
the
horses
always
hold
their
heads
way
up
and
snuff
and
whinny
in
fear
until
they
cross
the
dangerous
zone
here
on
the
top
of
this
mountain
where
the
bad
demon
peruses
the
book
of
human
destinies
is
the
same
phenomenon
and
i
realized
the
sacred
fear
of
the
mongols
as
well
as
the
stern
attraction
of
this
place
for
the
tall
almost
gigantic
descendants
of
jenghiz
khan
their
heads
tower
above
the
layers
of
poisonous
gas
so
that
they
can
reach
the
top
of
this
mysterious
and
terrible
mountain
also
it
is
possible
to
explain
this
phenomenon
geologically
because
here
in
this
region
is
the
southern
edge
of
the
coal
deposits
which
are
the
source
of
carbonic
acid
and
swamp
gases
not
far
from
the
ruins
in
the
lands
of
hun
doptchin
djamtso
there
is
a
small
lake
which
sometimes
burns
with
a
red
flame
terrifying
the
mongols
and
herds
of
horses
naturally
this
lake
is
rich
with
legends
here
a
meteor
formerly
fell
and
sank
far
into
the
earth
in
the
hole
this
lake
appeared
now
it
seems
the
inhabitants
of
the
subterranean
passages
and
are
laboring
to
extract
this
stone
of
the
sky
from
its
deep
bed
and
it
is
setting
the
water
on
fire
as
it
rises
and
falls
back
in
spite
of
their
every
effort
i
did
not
see
the
lake
myself
but
a
russian
colonist
told
me
that
it
may
be
petroleum
on
the
lake
that
is
fired
either
from
the
campfires
of
the
shepherds
or
by
the
blazing
rays
of
the
sun
at
any
rate
all
this
makes
it
very
easy
to
understand
the
attractions
for
the
great
mongol
potentates
the
strongest
impression
was
produced
upon
me
by
karakorum
the
place
where
the
cruel
and
wise
jenghiz
khan
lived
and
laid
his
gigantic
plans
for
overrunning
all
the
west
with
blood
and
for
covering
the
east
with
a
glory
never
before
seen
two
karakorums
were
erected
by
jenghiz
khan
one
here
near
tatsa
gol
on
the
caravan
road
and
the
other
in
pamir
where
the
sad
warriors
buried
the
greatest
of
human
conquerors
in
the
mausoleum
built
by
five
hundred
captives
who
were
sacrificed
to
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
when
their
work
was
done
the
warlike
pandita
hutuktu
prayed
on
the
ruins
where
the
shades
of
these
potentates
who
had
ruled
half
the
world
wandered
and
his
soul
longed
for
the
chimerical
exploits
and
for
the
glory
of
jenghiz
and
tamerlane
on
the
return
journey
we
were
invited
not
far
from
zain
to
visit
a
very
rich
mongol
by
the
way
he
had
already
prepared
the
yurtas
suitable
for
princes
ornamented
with
rich
carpets
and
silk
draperies
the
hutuktu
accepted
we
arranged
ourselves
on
the
soft
pillows
in
the
yurtas
as
the
hutuktu
blessed
the
mongol
touching
his
head
with
his
holy
hand
and
received
the
hatyks
the
host
then
had
a
whole
sheep
brought
in
to
us
boiled
in
a
huge
vessel
the
hutuktu
carved
off
one
hind
leg
and
offered
it
to
me
while
he
reserved
the
other
for
himself
after
this
he
gave
a
large
piece
of
meat
to
the
smallest
son
of
the
host
which
was
the
sign
that
pandita
hutuktu
invited
all
to
begin
the
feast
in
a
trice
the
sheep
was
entirely
carved
or
torn
up
and
in
the
hands
of
the
banqueters
when
the
hutuktu
had
thrown
down
by
the
brazier
the
white
bones
without
a
trace
of
meat
left
on
them
the
host
on
his
knees
withdrew
from
the
fire
a
piece
of
sheepskin
and
ceremoniously
offered
it
on
both
his
hands
to
the
hutuktu
pandita
began
to
clean
off
the
wool
and
ashes
with
his
knife
and
cutting
it
into
thin
strips
fell
to
eating
this
really
tasty
course
it
is
the
covering
from
just
above
the
breast
bone
and
is
called
in
mongolian
tarach
or
when
a
sheep
is
skinned
this
small
section
is
cut
out
and
placed
on
the
hot
coals
where
it
is
broiled
very
slowly
thus
prepared
it
is
considered
the
most
dainty
bit
of
the
whole
animal
and
is
always
presented
to
the
guest
of
honor
it
is
not
permissible
to
divide
it
such
is
the
strength
of
the
custom
and
ceremony
after
dinner
our
host
proposed
a
hunt
for
bighorns
a
large
herd
of
which
was
known
to
graze
in
the
mountains
within
less
than
a
mile
from
the
yurtas
horses
with
rich
saddles
and
bridles
were
led
up
all
the
elaborate
harness
of
the
hutuktu
s
mount
was
ornamented
with
red
and
yellow
bits
of
cloth
as
a
mark
of
his
rank
about
fifty
mongol
riders
galloped
behind
us
when
we
left
our
horses
we
were
placed
behind
the
rocks
roughly
three
hundred
paces
apart
and
the
mongols
began
the
encircling
movement
around
the
mountain
after
about
half
an
hour
i
noticed
way
up
among
the
rocks
something
flash
and
soon
made
out
a
fine
bighorn
jumping
with
tremendous
springs
from
rock
to
rock
and
behind
him
a
herd
of
some
twenty
odd
head
leaping
like
lightning
over
the
ground
i
was
vexed
beyond
words
when
it
appeared
that
the
mongols
had
made
a
mess
of
it
and
pushed
the
herd
out
to
the
side
before
having
completed
their
circle
but
happily
i
was
mistaken
behind
a
rock
right
ahead
of
the
herd
a
mongol
sprang
up
and
waved
his
hands
only
the
big
leader
was
not
frightened
and
kept
right
on
past
the
unarmed
mongol
while
all
the
rest
of
the
herd
swung
suddenly
round
and
rushed
right
down
upon
me
i
opened
fire
and
dropped
two
of
them
the
hutuktu
also
brought
down
one
as
well
as
a
musk
antelope
that
came
unexpectedly
from
behind
a
rock
hard
by
the
largest
pair
of
horns
weighed
about
thirty
pounds
but
they
were
from
a
young
sheep
the
day
following
our
return
to
zain
shabi
as
i
was
feeling
quite
recovered
i
decided
to
go
on
to
van
kure
at
my
from
the
hutuktu
i
received
a
large
hatyk
from
him
together
with
warmest
expressions
of
thanks
for
the
present
i
had
given
him
on
the
first
day
of
our
acquaintance
it
is
a
fine
medicine
he
exclaimed
after
our
trip
i
felt
quite
exhausted
but
i
took
your
medicine
and
am
now
quite
rejuvenated
many
many
thanks
the
poor
chap
had
swallowed
my
osmiridium
to
be
sure
it
could
not
harm
him
but
to
have
helped
him
was
wonderful
perhaps
doctors
in
the
occident
may
wish
to
try
this
new
harmless
and
very
cheap
remedy
only
eight
pounds
of
it
in
the
whole
world
and
i
merely
ask
that
they
leave
me
the
patent
rights
for
it
for
mongolia
barga
sinkiang
koko
nor
and
all
the
other
lands
of
central
asia
an
old
russian
colonist
went
as
guide
for
me
they
gave
me
a
big
but
light
and
comfortable
cart
hitched
and
drawn
in
a
marvelous
way
a
straight
pole
four
metres
long
was
fastened
athwart
the
front
of
the
shafts
on
either
side
two
riders
took
this
pole
across
their
saddle
pommels
and
galloped
away
with
me
across
the
plains
behind
us
galloped
four
other
riders
with
four
extra
horses
chapter
xxx
arrested
about
twelve
miles
from
zain
we
saw
from
a
ridge
a
snakelike
line
of
riders
crossing
the
valley
which
detachment
we
met
half
an
hour
later
on
the
shore
of
a
deep
swampy
stream
the
group
consisted
of
mongols
buriats
and
tibetans
armed
with
russian
rifles
at
the
head
of
the
column
were
two
men
one
of
whom
in
a
huge
black
astrakhan
and
black
felt
cape
with
red
caucasian
cowl
on
his
shoulders
blocked
my
road
and
in
a
coarse
harsh
voice
demanded
of
me
who
are
you
where
are
you
from
and
where
are
you
going
i
gave
also
a
laconic
answer
they
then
said
that
they
were
a
detachment
of
troops
from
baron
ungern
under
the
command
of
captain
vandaloff
i
am
captain
bezrodnoff
military
suddenly
he
laughed
loudly
his
insolent
stupid
face
did
not
please
me
and
bowing
to
the
officers
i
ordered
my
riders
to
move
oh
no
he
remonstrated
as
he
blocked
the
road
again
i
can
not
allow
you
to
go
farther
i
want
to
have
a
long
and
serious
conversation
with
you
and
you
will
have
to
come
back
to
zain
for
i
protested
and
called
attention
to
the
letter
of
colonel
kazagrandi
only
to
hear
bezrodnoff
answer
with
coldness
this
letter
is
a
matter
of
colonel
kazagrandi
s
and
to
bring
you
back
to
zain
and
talk
with
you
is
my
affair
now
give
me
your
but
i
could
not
yield
to
this
demand
even
though
death
were
threatened
listen
i
said
tell
me
frankly
is
yours
really
a
detachment
fighting
against
the
boisheviki
or
is
it
a
red
contingent
no
i
assure
you
replied
the
buriat
officer
vandaloff
approaching
me
we
have
already
been
fighting
the
bolsheviki
for
three
then
i
can
not
hand
you
my
weapon
i
calmly
replied
i
brought
it
from
soviet
siberia
have
had
many
fights
with
this
faithful
weapon
and
now
i
am
to
be
disarmed
by
white
officers
it
is
an
offence
that
i
can
not
with
these
words
i
threw
my
rifle
and
my
mauser
into
the
stream
the
officers
were
confused
bezrodnoff
turned
red
with
anger
i
freed
you
and
myself
from
humiliation
i
explained
bezrodnoff
in
silence
turned
his
horse
the
whole
detachment
of
three
hundred
men
passed
immediately
before
me
and
only
the
last
two
riders
stopped
ordered
my
mongols
to
turn
my
cart
round
and
then
fell
in
behind
my
little
group
so
i
was
arrested
one
of
the
horsemen
behind
me
was
a
russian
and
he
told
me
that
bezrodnoff
carried
with
him
many
death
decrees
i
was
sure
that
mine
was
among
them
stupid
very
stupid
what
was
the
use
of
fighting
one
s
way
through
red
detachments
of
being
frozen
and
hungry
of
almost
perishing
in
tibet
only
to
die
from
a
bullet
of
one
of
bezrodnoff
s
mongols
for
such
a
pleasure
it
was
not
worth
while
to
travel
so
long
and
so
far
in
every
siberian
cheka
i
could
have
had
this
end
so
joyfully
accorded
me
when
we
arrived
at
zain
shabi
my
luggage
was
examined
and
bezrodnoff
began
to
question
me
in
minutest
detail
about
the
events
in
uliassutai
we
talked
about
three
hours
during
which
i
tried
to
defend
all
the
officers
of
uliassutai
maintaining
that
one
must
not
trust
only
the
reports
of
domojiroff
when
our
conversation
was
finished
the
captain
stood
up
and
offered
his
apologies
for
detaining
me
in
my
journey
afterwards
he
presented
me
a
fine
mauser
with
silver
mountings
on
the
handle
and
said
your
pride
greatly
pleased
me
i
beg
you
to
receive
this
weapon
as
a
memento
of
the
following
morning
i
set
out
anew
from
zain
shabi
having
in
my
pocket
the
of
bezrodnoff
for
his
outposts
chapter
xxxi
traveling
by
urga
once
more
we
traveled
along
the
now
known
places
the
mountain
from
which
i
espied
the
detachment
of
bezrodnoff
the
stream
into
which
i
had
thrown
my
weapon
and
soon
all
this
lay
behind
us
at
the
first
ourton
we
were
disappointed
because
we
did
not
find
horses
there
in
the
yurtas
were
only
the
host
with
two
of
his
sons
i
showed
him
my
document
and
he
exclaimed
noyon
has
the
right
of
horses
will
be
brought
very
he
jumped
into
his
saddle
took
two
of
my
mongols
with
him
providing
them
and
himself
with
long
thin
poles
four
or
five
metres
in
length
and
fitted
at
the
end
with
a
loop
of
rope
and
galloped
away
my
cart
moved
behind
them
we
left
the
road
crossed
the
plain
for
an
hour
and
came
upon
a
big
herd
of
horses
grazing
there
the
mongol
began
to
catch
a
quota
of
them
for
us
with
his
pole
and
noose
or
urga
when
out
of
the
mountains
nearby
came
galloping
the
owners
of
the
herds
when
the
old
mongol
showed
my
papers
to
them
they
submissively
acquiesced
and
substituted
four
of
their
men
for
those
who
had
come
with
me
thus
far
in
this
manner
the
mongols
travel
not
along
the
ourton
or
station
road
but
directly
from
one
herd
to
another
where
the
fresh
horses
are
caught
and
saddled
and
the
new
owners
substituted
for
those
of
the
last
herd
all
the
mongols
so
effected
by
the
right
of
urga
try
to
finish
their
task
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
gallop
like
mad
for
the
nearest
herd
in
your
general
direction
of
travel
to
turn
over
their
task
to
their
neighbor
any
traveler
having
this
right
of
urga
can
catch
horses
himself
and
if
there
are
no
owners
can
force
the
former
ones
to
carry
on
and
leave
the
animals
in
the
next
herd
he
requisitions
but
this
happens
very
rarely
because
the
mongol
never
likes
to
seek
out
his
animals
in
another
s
herd
as
it
always
gives
so
many
chances
for
controversy
it
was
from
this
custom
according
to
one
explanation
that
the
town
of
urga
took
its
name
among
outsiders
by
the
mongols
themselves
it
is
always
referred
to
as
ta
kure
the
great
the
reason
the
buriats
and
russians
who
were
the
first
to
trade
into
this
region
called
it
urga
was
because
it
was
the
principal
destination
of
all
the
trading
expeditions
which
crossed
the
plains
by
this
old
method
or
right
of
travel
a
second
explanation
is
that
the
town
lies
in
a
loop
whose
sides
are
formed
by
three
mountain
ridges
along
one
of
which
the
river
tola
runs
like
the
pole
or
stick
of
the
familiar
urga
of
the
plains
thanks
to
this
unique
ticket
of
urga
i
crossed
quite
untraveled
sections
of
mongolia
for
about
two
hundred
miles
it
gave
me
the
welcome
opportunity
to
observe
the
fauna
of
this
part
of
the
country
i
saw
many
huge
herds
of
mongolian
antelopes
running
from
five
to
six
thousand
many
groups
of
bighorns
wapiti
and
kabarga
antelopes
sometimes
small
herds
of
wild
horses
and
wild
asses
flashed
as
a
vision
on
the
horizon
in
one
place
i
observed
a
big
colony
of
marmots
all
over
an
area
of
several
square
miles
their
mounds
were
scattered
with
the
holes
leading
down
to
their
runways
below
the
dwellings
of
the
marmot
in
and
out
among
these
mounds
the
or
brown
animals
ran
in
all
sizes
up
to
half
that
of
an
average
dog
they
ran
heavily
and
the
skin
on
their
fat
bodies
moved
as
though
it
were
too
big
for
them
the
marmots
are
splendid
prospectors
always
digging
deep
ditches
throwing
out
on
the
surface
all
the
stones
in
many
places
i
saw
mounds
the
marmots
had
made
from
copper
ore
and
farther
north
some
from
minerals
containing
wolfram
and
vanadium
whenever
the
marmot
is
at
the
entrance
of
his
hole
he
sits
up
straight
on
his
hind
legs
and
looks
like
a
bit
of
wood
a
small
stump
or
a
stone
as
soon
as
he
spies
a
rider
in
the
distance
he
watches
him
with
great
curiosity
and
begins
whistling
sharply
this
curiosity
of
the
marmots
is
taken
advantage
of
by
the
hunters
who
sneak
up
to
their
holes
flourishing
streamers
of
cloth
on
the
tips
of
long
poles
the
whole
attention
of
the
small
animals
is
concentrated
on
this
small
flag
and
only
the
bullet
that
takes
his
life
explains
to
him
the
reason
for
this
previously
unknown
object
i
saw
a
very
exciting
picture
as
i
passed
through
a
marmot
colony
near
the
orkhon
river
there
were
thousands
of
holes
here
so
that
my
mongols
had
to
use
all
their
skill
to
keep
the
horses
from
breaking
their
legs
in
them
i
noticed
an
eagle
circling
high
overhead
all
of
a
sudden
he
dropped
like
a
stone
to
the
top
of
a
mound
where
he
sat
motionless
as
a
rock
the
marmot
in
a
few
minutes
ran
out
of
his
hole
to
a
neighbor
s
doorway
the
eagle
calmly
jumped
down
from
the
top
and
with
one
wing
closed
the
entrance
to
the
hole
the
rodent
heard
the
noise
turned
back
and
rushed
to
the
attack
trying
to
break
through
to
his
hole
where
he
had
evidently
left
his
family
the
struggle
began
the
eagle
fought
with
one
free
wing
one
leg
and
his
beak
but
did
not
withdraw
the
bar
to
the
entrance
the
marmot
jumped
at
the
rapacious
bird
with
great
boldness
but
soon
fell
from
a
blow
on
the
head
only
then
the
eagle
withdrew
his
wing
approached
the
marmot
finished
him
off
and
with
difficulty
lifted
him
in
his
talons
to
carry
him
away
to
the
mountains
for
a
tasty
luncheon
in
the
more
barren
places
with
only
occasional
spears
of
grass
in
the
plain
another
species
of
rodent
lives
called
imouran
about
the
size
of
a
squirrel
they
have
a
coat
the
same
color
as
the
prairie
and
running
about
it
like
snakes
they
collect
the
seeds
that
are
blown
across
by
the
wind
and
carry
them
down
into
their
diminutive
homes
the
imouran
has
a
truly
faithful
friend
the
yellow
lark
of
the
prairie
with
a
brown
back
and
head
when
he
sees
the
imouran
running
across
the
plain
he
settles
on
his
back
flaps
his
wings
in
balance
and
rides
well
this
swiftly
galloping
mount
who
gaily
flourishes
his
long
shaggy
tail
the
lark
during
his
ride
skilfully
and
quickly
catches
the
parasites
living
on
the
body
of
his
friend
giving
evidence
of
his
enjoyment
of
his
work
with
a
short
agreeable
song
the
mongols
call
the
imouran
the
steed
of
the
gay
the
lark
warns
the
imouran
of
the
approach
of
eagles
and
hawks
with
three
sharp
whistles
the
moment
he
sees
the
aerial
brigand
and
takes
refuge
himself
behind
a
stone
or
in
a
small
ditch
after
this
signal
no
imouran
will
stick
his
head
out
of
his
hole
until
the
danger
is
past
thus
the
gay
lark
and
his
steed
live
in
kindly
neighborliness
in
other
parts
of
mongolia
where
there
was
very
rich
grass
i
saw
another
type
of
rodent
which
i
had
previously
come
across
in
urianhai
it
is
a
gigantic
black
prairie
rat
with
a
short
tail
and
lives
in
colonies
of
from
one
to
two
hundred
he
is
interesting
and
unique
as
the
most
skilful
farmer
among
the
animals
in
his
preparation
of
his
winter
supply
of
fodder
during
the
weeks
when
the
grass
is
most
succulent
he
actually
mows
it
down
with
swift
jerky
swings
of
his
head
cutting
about
twenty
or
thirty
stalks
with
his
sharp
long
front
teeth
then
he
allows
his
grass
to
cure
and
later
puts
up
his
prepared
hay
in
a
most
scientific
manner
first
he
makes
a
mound
about
a
foot
high
through
this
he
pushes
down
into
the
ground
four
slanting
stakes
converging
toward
the
middle
of
the
pile
and
binds
them
close
over
the
surface
of
the
hay
with
the
longest
strands
of
grass
leaving
the
ends
protruding
enough
for
him
to
add
another
foot
to
the
height
of
the
pile
when
he
again
binds
the
surface
with
more
long
strands
all
this
to
keep
his
winter
supply
of
food
from
blowing
away
over
the
prairie
this
stock
he
always
locates
right
at
the
door
of
his
den
to
avoid
long
winter
hauls
the
horses
and
camels
are
very
fond
of
this
small
farmer
s
hay
because
it
is
always
made
from
the
most
nutritious
grass
the
haycocks
are
so
strongly
made
that
one
can
hardly
kick
them
to
pieces
almost
everywhere
in
mongolia
i
met
either
single
pairs
or
whole
flocks
of
the
prairie
partridges
salga
or
partridge
swallow
so
called
because
they
have
long
sharp
tails
resembling
those
of
swallows
and
because
their
flight
also
is
a
close
copy
of
that
of
the
swallow
these
birds
are
very
tame
or
fearless
allowing
men
to
come
within
ten
or
fifteen
paces
of
them
but
when
they
do
break
they
go
high
and
fly
long
distances
without
lighting
whistling
all
the
time
quite
like
swallows
their
general
markings
are
light
grey
and
yellow
though
the
males
have
pretty
chocolate
spots
on
the
backs
and
wings
while
their
legs
and
feet
are
heavily
feathered
my
opportunity
to
make
these
observations
came
from
traveling
through
unfrequented
regions
by
the
urga
which
however
had
its
counterbalancing
disadvantages
the
mongols
carried
me
directly
and
swiftly
toward
my
destination
receiving
with
great
satisfaction
the
presents
of
chinese
dollars
which
i
gave
them
but
after
having
made
about
five
thousand
miles
on
my
cossack
saddle
that
now
lay
behind
me
on
the
cart
all
covered
with
dust
like
common
merchandise
i
rebelled
against
being
wracked
and
torn
by
the
rough
riding
of
the
cart
as
it
was
swung
heedlessly
over
stones
hillocks
and
ditches
by
the
wild
horses
with
their
equally
wild
riders
bounding
and
cracking
and
holding
together
only
through
its
tenacity
of
purpose
in
demonstrating
the
cosiness
and
attractiveness
of
a
good
mongol
equipage
all
my
bones
began
to
ache
finally
i
groaned
at
every
lunge
and
at
last
i
suffered
a
very
sharp
attack
of
ischias
or
sciatica
in
my
wounded
leg
at
night
i
could
neither
sleep
lie
down
nor
sit
with
comfort
and
spent
the
whole
night
pacing
up
and
down
the
plain
listening
to
the
loud
snoring
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
yurta
at
times
i
had
to
fight
the
two
huge
black
dogs
which
attacked
me
the
following
day
i
could
endure
the
wracking
only
until
noon
and
was
then
forced
to
give
up
and
lie
down
the
pain
was
unbearable
i
could
not
move
my
leg
nor
my
back
and
finally
fell
into
a
high
fever
we
were
forced
to
stop
and
rest
i
swallowed
all
my
stock
of
aspirin
and
quinine
but
without
relief
before
me
was
a
sleepless
night
about
which
i
could
not
think
without
weakening
fear
we
had
stopped
in
the
yurta
for
guests
by
the
side
of
a
small
monastery
my
mongols
invited
the
lama
doctor
to
visit
me
who
gave
me
two
very
bitter
powders
and
assured
me
i
should
be
able
to
continue
in
the
morning
i
soon
felt
a
stimulated
palpitation
of
the
heart
after
which
the
pain
became
even
sharper
again
i
spent
the
night
without
any
sleep
but
when
the
sun
arose
the
pain
ceased
instantly
and
after
an
hour
i
ordered
them
to
saddle
me
a
horse
as
i
was
afraid
to
continue
further
in
the
cart
while
the
mongols
were
catching
the
horses
there
came
to
my
tent
colonel
philipoff
who
told
me
that
he
denied
all
the
accusations
that
he
and
his
brother
and
poletika
were
bolsheviki
and
that
bezrodnoff
allowed
him
to
go
to
van
kure
to
meet
baron
ungern
who
was
expected
there
only
philipoff
did
not
know
that
his
mongol
guide
was
armed
with
a
bomb
and
that
another
mongol
had
been
sent
on
ahead
with
a
letter
to
baron
ungern
he
did
not
know
that
poletika
and
his
brothers
were
shot
at
the
same
time
in
zain
shabi
philipoff
was
in
a
hurry
and
wanted
to
reach
van
kure
that
day
i
left
an
hour
after
him
chapter
xxxii
an
old
fortune
teller
from
this
point
we
began
traveling
along
the
ourton
road
in
this
region
the
mongols
had
very
poor
and
exhausted
horses
because
they
were
forced
continuously
to
supply
mounts
to
the
numerous
envoys
of
daichin
van
and
of
colonel
kazagrandi
we
were
compelled
to
spend
the
night
at
the
last
ourton
before
van
kure
where
a
stout
old
mongol
and
his
son
kept
the
station
after
our
supper
he
took
the
of
the
sheep
which
had
been
carefully
scraped
clean
of
all
the
flesh
and
looking
at
me
placed
this
bone
in
the
coals
with
some
incantations
and
said
i
want
to
tell
your
fortune
all
my
predictions
come
when
the
bone
had
been
blackened
he
drew
it
out
blew
off
the
ashes
and
began
to
scrutinize
the
surface
very
closely
and
to
look
through
it
into
the
fire
he
continued
his
examination
for
a
long
time
and
then
with
fear
in
his
face
placed
the
bone
back
in
the
coals
what
did
you
see
i
asked
laughing
be
silent
he
whispered
i
made
out
horrible
he
again
took
out
the
bone
and
began
examining
it
all
over
all
the
time
whispering
prayers
and
making
strange
movements
in
a
very
solemn
quiet
voice
he
began
his
predictions
death
in
the
form
of
a
tall
white
man
with
red
hair
will
stand
behind
you
and
will
watch
you
long
and
close
you
will
feel
it
and
wait
but
death
will
withdraw
another
white
man
will
become
your
friend
before
the
fourth
day
you
will
lose
your
acquaintances
they
will
die
by
a
long
knife
i
already
see
them
being
eaten
by
the
dogs
beware
of
the
man
with
a
head
like
a
saddle
he
will
strive
for
your
for
a
long
time
after
the
fortune
had
been
told
we
sat
smoking
and
drinking
tea
but
still
the
old
fellow
looked
at
me
only
with
fear
through
my
brain
flashed
the
thought
that
thus
must
his
companions
in
prison
look
at
one
who
is
condemned
to
death
the
next
morning
we
left
the
fortune
teller
before
the
sun
was
up
and
when
we
had
made
about
fifteen
miles
hove
in
sight
of
van
kure
i
found
colonel
kazagrandi
at
his
headquarters
he
was
a
man
of
good
family
an
experienced
engineer
and
a
splendid
officer
who
had
distinguished
himself
in
the
war
at
the
defence
of
the
island
of
moon
in
the
baltic
and
afterwards
in
the
fight
with
the
bolsheviki
on
the
volga
colonel
kazagrandi
offered
me
a
bath
in
a
real
tub
which
had
its
habitat
in
the
house
of
the
president
of
the
local
chamber
of
commerce
as
i
was
in
this
house
a
tall
young
captain
entered
he
had
long
curly
red
hair
and
an
unusually
white
face
though
heavy
and
stolid
with
large
eyes
and
with
beautiful
tender
almost
girlish
lips
but
in
his
eyes
there
was
such
cold
cruelty
that
it
was
quite
unpleasant
to
look
at
his
otherwise
fine
face
when
he
left
the
room
our
host
told
me
that
he
was
captain
veseloffsky
the
adjutant
of
general
rezukhin
who
was
fighting
against
the
bolsheviki
in
the
north
of
mongolia
they
had
just
that
day
arrived
for
a
conference
with
baron
ungern
after
luncheon
colonel
kazagrandi
invited
me
to
his
yurta
and
began
discussing
events
in
western
mongolia
where
the
situation
had
become
very
tense
do
you
know
dr
gay
kazagrandi
asked
me
you
know
he
helped
me
to
form
my
detachment
but
urga
accuses
him
of
being
the
agent
of
the
i
made
all
the
defences
i
could
for
gay
he
had
helped
me
and
had
been
exonerated
by
kolchak
yes
yes
and
i
justified
gay
in
such
a
manner
said
the
colonel
but
rezukhin
who
has
just
arrived
today
has
brought
letters
of
gay
s
to
the
bolsheviki
which
were
seized
in
transit
by
order
of
baron
ungern
gay
and
his
family
have
today
been
sent
to
the
headquarters
of
rezukhin
and
i
fear
that
they
will
not
reach
this
why
i
asked
they
will
be
executed
on
the
road
answered
colonel
kazagrandi
what
are
we
to
do
i
responded
gay
can
not
be
a
bolshevik
because
he
is
too
well
educated
and
too
clever
for
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
murmured
the
colonel
with
a
despondent
gesture
try
to
speak
with
i
decided
to
proceed
at
once
to
rezukhin
but
just
then
colonel
philipoff
entered
and
began
talking
about
the
errors
being
made
in
the
training
of
the
soldiers
when
i
had
donned
my
coat
another
man
came
in
he
was
a
small
sized
officer
with
an
old
green
cossack
cap
with
a
visor
a
torn
grey
mongol
overcoat
and
with
his
right
hand
in
a
black
sling
tied
around
his
neck
it
was
general
rezukhin
to
whom
i
was
at
once
introduced
during
the
conversation
the
general
very
politely
and
very
skilfully
inquired
about
the
lives
of
philipoff
and
myself
during
the
last
three
years
joking
and
laughing
with
discretion
and
modesty
when
he
soon
took
his
leave
i
availed
myself
of
the
chance
and
went
out
with
him
he
listened
very
attentively
and
politely
to
me
and
afterwards
in
his
quiet
voice
said
dr
gay
is
the
agent
of
the
soviets
disguised
as
a
white
in
order
the
better
to
see
hear
and
know
everything
we
are
surrounded
by
our
enemies
the
russian
people
are
demoralized
and
will
undertake
any
treachery
for
money
such
is
gay
anyway
what
is
the
use
of
discussing
him
further
he
and
his
family
are
no
longer
alive
today
my
men
cut
them
to
pieces
five
kilometres
from
in
consternation
and
fear
i
looked
at
the
face
of
this
small
dapper
man
with
such
soft
voice
and
courteous
manners
in
his
eyes
i
read
such
hate
and
tenacity
that
i
understood
at
once
the
trembling
respect
of
all
the
officers
whom
i
had
seen
in
his
presence
afterwards
in
urga
i
learned
more
of
this
general
rezukhin
distinguished
by
his
absolute
bravery
and
boundless
cruelty
he
was
the
watchdog
of
baron
ungern
ready
to
throw
himself
into
the
fire
and
to
spring
at
the
throat
of
anyone
his
master
might
indicate
only
four
days
then
had
elapsed
before
my
acquaintances
died
by
a
long
knife
so
that
one
part
of
the
prediction
had
been
thus
fulfilled
and
now
i
have
to
await
death
s
threat
to
me
the
delay
was
not
long
only
two
days
later
the
chief
of
the
asiatic
division
of
cavalry
arrived
baron
ungern
von
sternberg
chapter
xxxiii
death
from
the
white
man
will
stand
behind
you
the
terrible
general
the
baron
arrived
quite
unexpectedly
unnoticed
by
the
outposts
of
colonel
kazagrandi
after
a
talk
with
kazagrandi
the
baron
invited
colonel
philipoff
and
me
into
his
presence
colonel
kazagrandi
brought
the
word
to
me
i
wanted
to
go
at
once
but
was
detained
about
half
an
hour
by
the
colonel
who
then
sped
me
with
the
words
now
god
help
you
go
it
was
a
strange
parting
message
not
reassuring
and
quite
enigmatical
i
took
my
mauser
and
also
hid
in
the
cuff
of
my
coat
my
cyanide
of
potassium
the
baron
was
quartered
in
the
yurta
of
the
military
doctor
when
i
entered
the
court
captain
veseloffsky
came
up
to
me
he
had
a
cossack
sword
and
a
revolver
without
its
holster
beneath
his
girdle
he
went
into
the
yurta
to
report
my
arrival
come
in
he
said
as
he
emerged
from
the
tent
at
the
entrance
my
eyes
were
struck
with
the
sight
of
a
pool
of
blood
that
had
not
yet
had
time
to
drain
down
into
the
ground
an
ominous
greeting
that
seemed
to
carry
the
very
voice
of
one
just
gone
before
me
i
knocked
come
in
was
the
answer
in
a
high
tenor
as
i
passed
the
threshold
a
figure
in
a
red
silk
mongolian
coat
rushed
at
me
with
the
spring
of
a
tiger
grabbed
and
shook
my
hand
as
though
in
flight
across
my
path
and
then
fell
prone
on
the
bed
at
the
side
of
the
tent
tell
me
who
you
are
hereabouts
are
many
spies
and
agitators
he
cried
out
in
an
hysterical
voice
as
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
me
in
one
moment
i
perceived
his
appearance
and
psychology
a
small
head
on
wide
shoulders
blonde
hair
in
disorder
a
reddish
bristling
moustache
a
skinny
exhausted
face
like
those
on
the
old
byzantine
ikons
then
everything
else
faded
from
view
save
a
big
protruding
forehead
overhanging
steely
sharp
eyes
these
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
like
those
of
an
animal
from
a
cave
my
observations
lasted
for
but
a
flash
but
i
understood
that
before
me
was
a
very
dangerous
man
ready
for
an
instant
spring
into
irrevocable
action
though
the
danger
was
evident
i
felt
the
deepest
offence
sit
down
he
snapped
out
in
a
hissing
voice
as
he
pointed
to
a
chair
and
impatiently
pulled
at
his
moustache
i
felt
my
anger
rising
through
my
whole
body
and
i
said
to
him
without
taking
the
chair
you
have
allowed
yourself
to
offend
me
baron
my
name
is
well
enough
known
so
that
you
can
not
thus
indulge
yourself
in
such
epithets
you
can
do
with
me
as
you
wish
because
force
is
on
your
side
but
you
can
not
compel
me
to
speak
with
one
who
gives
me
at
these
words
of
mine
he
swung
his
feet
down
off
the
bed
and
with
evident
astonishment
began
to
survey
me
holding
his
breath
and
pulling
still
at
his
moustache
retaining
my
exterior
calmness
i
began
to
glance
indifferently
around
the
yurta
and
only
then
i
noticed
general
rezukhin
i
bowed
to
him
and
received
his
silent
acknowledgment
after
that
i
swung
my
glance
back
to
the
baron
who
sat
with
bowed
head
and
closed
eyes
from
time
to
time
rubbing
his
brow
and
mumbling
to
himself
suddenly
he
stood
up
and
sharply
said
looking
past
and
over
me
go
out
there
is
no
need
of
more
i
swung
round
and
saw
captain
veseloffsky
with
his
white
cold
face
i
had
not
heard
him
enter
he
did
a
formal
about
face
and
passed
out
of
the
door
death
from
the
white
man
has
stood
behind
me
i
thought
but
has
it
quite
left
me
the
baron
stood
thinking
for
some
time
and
then
began
to
speak
in
jumbled
unfinished
phrases
i
ask
your
pardon
you
must
understand
there
are
so
many
traitors
honest
men
have
disappeared
i
can
not
trust
anybody
all
names
are
false
and
assumed
documents
are
counterfeited
eyes
and
words
deceive
all
is
demoralized
insulted
by
bolshevism
i
just
ordered
colonel
philipoff
cut
down
he
who
called
himself
the
representative
of
the
russian
white
organization
in
the
lining
of
his
garments
were
found
two
secret
bolshevik
codes
when
my
officer
flourished
his
sword
over
him
he
exclaimed
why
do
you
kill
me
tavarische
i
can
not
trust
anybody
he
was
silent
and
i
also
held
my
peace
i
beg
your
pardon
he
began
anew
i
offended
you
but
i
am
not
simply
a
man
i
am
a
leader
of
great
forces
and
have
in
my
head
so
much
care
sorrow
and
woe
in
his
voice
i
felt
there
was
mingled
despair
and
sincerity
he
frankly
put
out
his
hand
to
me
again
silence
at
last
i
answered
what
do
you
order
me
to
do
now
for
i
have
neither
counterfeit
nor
real
documents
but
many
of
your
officers
know
me
and
in
urga
i
can
find
many
who
will
testify
that
i
could
be
neither
agitator
nor
no
need
no
need
interrupted
the
baron
all
is
clear
all
is
understood
i
was
in
your
soul
and
i
know
all
it
is
the
truth
which
hutuktu
narabanchi
has
written
about
you
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
explained
how
my
friend
and
i
had
escaped
from
soviet
russia
in
the
effort
to
reach
our
native
land
and
how
a
group
of
polish
soldiers
had
joined
us
in
the
hope
of
getting
back
to
poland
and
i
asked
that
help
be
given
us
to
reach
the
nearest
port
with
pleasure
with
pleasure
i
will
help
you
all
he
answered
excitedly
i
shall
drive
you
to
urga
in
my
motor
car
tomorrow
we
shall
start
and
there
in
urga
we
shall
talk
about
further
taking
my
leave
i
went
out
of
the
yurta
on
arriving
at
my
quarters
i
found
colonel
kazagrandi
in
great
anxiety
walking
up
and
down
my
room
thanks
be
to
god
he
exclaimed
and
crossed
himself
his
joy
was
very
touching
but
at
the
same
time
i
thought
that
the
colonel
could
have
taken
much
more
active
measures
for
the
salvation
of
his
guest
if
he
had
been
so
minded
the
agitation
of
this
day
had
tired
me
and
made
me
feel
years
older
when
i
looked
in
the
mirror
i
was
certain
there
were
more
white
hairs
on
my
head
at
night
i
could
not
sleep
for
the
flashing
thoughts
of
the
young
fine
face
of
colonel
philipoff
the
pool
of
blood
the
cold
eyes
of
captain
veseloffsky
the
sound
of
baron
ungern
s
voice
with
its
tones
of
despair
and
woe
until
finally
i
sank
into
a
heavy
stupor
i
was
awakened
by
baron
ungern
who
came
to
ask
pardon
that
he
could
not
take
me
in
his
motor
car
because
he
was
obliged
to
take
daichin
van
with
him
but
he
informed
me
that
he
had
left
instructions
to
give
me
his
own
white
camel
and
two
cossacks
as
servants
i
had
no
time
to
thank
him
before
he
rushed
out
of
my
room
sleep
then
entirely
deserted
me
so
i
dressed
and
began
smoking
pipe
after
pipe
of
tobacco
as
i
thought
how
much
easier
to
fight
the
bolsheviki
on
the
swamps
of
seybi
and
to
cross
the
snowy
peaks
of
ulan
taiga
where
the
bad
demons
kill
all
the
travelers
they
can
there
everything
was
simple
and
comprehensible
but
here
it
is
all
a
mad
nightmare
a
dark
and
foreboding
storm
i
felt
some
tragedy
some
horror
in
every
movement
of
baron
ungern
behind
whom
paced
this
silent
veseloffsky
and
death
chapter
xxxiv
the
horror
of
war
at
dawn
of
the
following
morning
they
led
up
the
splendid
white
camel
for
me
and
we
moved
away
my
company
consisted
of
the
two
cossacks
two
mongol
soldiers
and
one
lama
with
two
pack
camels
carrying
the
tent
and
food
i
still
apprehended
that
the
baron
had
it
in
mind
not
to
dispose
of
me
before
my
friends
there
in
van
kure
but
to
prepare
this
journey
for
me
under
the
guise
of
which
it
would
be
so
easy
to
do
away
with
me
by
the
road
a
bullet
in
the
back
and
all
would
be
finished
consequently
i
was
momentarily
ready
to
draw
my
revolver
and
defend
myself
i
took
care
all
the
time
to
have
the
cossacks
either
ahead
of
me
or
at
the
side
about
noon
we
heard
the
distant
honk
of
a
motor
car
and
soon
saw
baron
ungern
whizzing
by
us
at
full
speed
with
him
were
two
adjutants
and
prince
daichin
van
the
baron
greeted
me
very
kindly
and
shouted
shall
see
you
again
in
urga
ah
i
thought
evidently
i
shall
reach
urga
so
i
can
be
at
ease
during
my
trip
and
in
urga
i
have
many
friends
beside
the
presence
there
of
the
bold
polish
soldiers
whom
i
had
worked
with
in
uliassutai
and
who
had
outdistanced
me
in
this
after
the
meeting
with
the
baron
my
cossacks
became
very
attentive
to
me
and
sought
to
distract
me
with
stories
they
told
me
about
their
very
severe
struggles
with
the
bolsheviki
in
transbaikalia
and
mongolia
about
the
battle
with
the
chinese
near
urga
about
finding
communistic
passports
on
several
chinese
soldiers
from
moscow
about
the
bravery
of
baron
ungern
and
how
he
would
sit
at
the
campfire
smoking
and
drinking
tea
right
on
the
battle
line
without
ever
being
touched
by
a
bullet
at
one
fight
bullets
entered
his
overcoat
saddle
and
the
boxes
by
his
side
and
again
left
him
untouched
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
his
great
influence
over
the
mongols
they
related
how
before
the
battle
he
had
made
a
reconnaissance
in
urga
with
only
one
cossack
and
on
his
way
back
had
killed
a
chinese
officer
and
two
soldiers
with
his
bamboo
stick
or
tashur
how
he
had
no
outfit
save
one
change
of
linen
and
one
extra
pair
of
boots
how
he
was
always
calm
and
jovial
in
battle
and
severe
and
morose
in
the
rare
days
of
peace
and
how
he
was
everywhere
his
soldiers
were
fighting
i
told
them
in
turn
of
my
escape
from
siberia
and
with
chatting
thus
the
day
slipped
by
very
quickly
our
camels
trotted
all
the
time
so
that
instead
of
the
ordinary
eighteen
to
twenty
miles
per
day
we
made
nearly
fifty
my
mount
was
the
fastest
of
them
all
he
was
a
huge
white
animal
with
a
splendid
thick
mane
and
had
been
presented
to
baron
ungern
by
some
prince
of
inner
mongolia
with
two
black
sables
tied
on
the
bridle
he
was
a
calm
strong
bold
giant
of
the
desert
on
whose
back
i
felt
myself
as
though
perched
on
the
tower
of
a
building
beyond
the
orkhon
river
we
came
across
the
first
dead
body
of
a
chinese
soldier
which
lay
face
up
and
arms
outstretched
right
in
the
middle
of
the
road
when
we
had
crossed
the
burgut
mountains
we
entered
the
tola
river
valley
farther
up
which
urga
is
located
the
road
was
strewn
with
the
overcoats
shirts
boots
caps
and
kettles
which
the
chinese
had
thrown
away
in
their
flight
and
marked
by
many
of
their
dead
further
on
the
road
crossed
a
morass
where
on
either
side
lay
great
mounds
of
the
dead
bodies
of
men
horses
and
camels
with
broken
carts
and
military
debris
of
every
sort
here
the
tibetans
of
baron
ungern
had
cut
up
the
escaping
chinese
baggage
transport
and
it
was
a
strange
and
gloomy
contrast
to
see
the
piles
of
dead
besides
the
effervescing
awakening
life
of
spring
in
every
pool
wild
ducks
of
different
kinds
floated
about
in
the
high
grass
the
cranes
performed
their
weird
dance
of
courtship
on
the
lakes
great
flocks
of
swans
and
geese
were
swimming
through
the
swampy
places
like
spots
of
light
moved
the
brilliantly
colored
pairs
of
the
mongolian
sacred
bird
the
turpan
or
lama
goose
on
the
higher
dry
places
flocks
of
wild
turkey
gamboled
and
fought
as
they
fed
flocks
of
the
salga
partridge
whistled
by
while
on
the
mountain
side
not
far
away
the
wolves
lay
basking
and
turning
in
the
lazy
warmth
of
the
sun
whining
and
occasionally
barking
like
playful
dogs
nature
knows
only
life
death
is
for
her
but
an
episode
whose
traces
she
rubs
out
with
sand
and
snow
or
ornaments
with
luxuriant
greenery
and
brightly
colored
bushes
and
flowers
what
matters
it
to
nature
if
a
mother
at
chefoo
or
on
the
banks
of
the
yangtse
offers
her
bowl
of
rice
with
burning
incense
at
some
shrine
and
prays
for
the
return
of
her
son
that
has
fallen
unknown
for
all
time
on
the
plains
along
the
tola
where
his
bones
will
dry
beneath
the
rays
of
nature
s
dissipating
fire
and
be
scattered
by
her
winds
over
the
sands
of
the
prairie
it
is
splendid
this
indifference
of
nature
to
death
and
her
greediness
for
life
on
the
fourth
day
we
made
the
shores
of
the
tola
well
after
nightfall
we
could
not
find
the
regular
ford
and
i
forced
my
camel
to
enter
the
stream
in
the
attempt
to
make
a
crossing
without
guidance
very
fortunately
i
found
a
shallow
though
somewhat
miry
place
and
we
got
over
all
right
this
is
something
to
be
thankful
for
in
fording
a
river
with
a
camel
because
when
your
mount
finds
the
water
too
deep
coming
up
around
his
neck
he
does
not
strike
out
and
swim
like
a
horse
will
do
but
just
rolls
over
on
his
side
and
floats
which
is
vastly
inconvenient
for
his
rider
down
by
the
river
we
pegged
our
tent
fifteen
miles
further
on
we
crossed
a
battlefield
where
the
third
great
battle
for
the
independence
of
mongolia
had
been
fought
here
the
troops
of
baron
ungern
clashed
with
six
thousand
chinese
moving
down
from
kiakhta
to
the
aid
of
urga
the
chinese
were
completely
defeated
and
four
thousand
prisoners
taken
however
these
surrendered
chinese
tried
to
escape
during
the
night
baron
ungern
sent
the
transbaikal
cossacks
and
tibetans
in
pursuit
of
them
and
it
was
their
work
which
we
saw
on
this
field
of
death
there
were
still
about
fifteen
hundred
unburied
and
as
many
more
interred
according
to
the
statements
of
our
cossacks
who
had
participated
in
this
battle
the
killed
showed
terrible
sword
wounds
everywhere
equipment
and
other
debris
were
scattered
about
the
mongols
with
their
herds
moved
away
from
the
neighborhood
and
their
place
was
taken
by
the
wolves
which
hid
behind
every
stone
and
in
every
ditch
as
we
passed
packs
of
dogs
that
had
become
wild
fought
with
the
wolves
over
the
prey
at
last
we
left
this
place
of
carnage
to
the
cursed
god
of
war
soon
we
approached
a
shallow
rapid
stream
where
the
mongols
slipped
from
their
camels
took
off
their
caps
and
began
drinking
it
was
a
sacred
stream
which
passed
beside
the
abode
of
the
living
buddha
from
this
winding
valley
we
suddenly
turned
into
another
where
a
great
mountain
ridge
covered
with
dark
dense
forest
loomed
up
before
us
holy
exclaimed
the
lama
the
abode
of
the
gods
which
guard
our
living
buddha
is
the
huge
knot
which
ties
together
here
three
mountain
chains
gegyl
from
the
southwest
gangyn
from
the
south
and
huntu
from
the
north
this
mountain
covered
with
virgin
forest
is
the
property
of
the
living
buddha
the
forests
are
full
of
nearly
all
the
varieties
of
animals
found
in
mongolia
but
hunting
is
not
allowed
any
mongol
violating
this
law
is
condemned
to
death
while
foreigners
are
deported
crossing
the
is
forbidden
under
penalty
of
death
this
command
was
transgressed
by
only
one
man
baron
ungern
who
crossed
the
mountain
with
fifty
cossacks
penetrated
to
the
palace
of
the
living
buddha
where
the
pontiff
of
urga
was
being
held
under
arrest
by
the
chinese
and
stole
him
chapter
xxxv
in
the
city
of
living

of
buddhas
and
monks
at
last
before
our
eyes
the
abode
of
the
living
buddha
at
the
foot
of
behind
white
walls
rose
a
white
tibetan
building
covered
with
tiles
that
glittered
under
the
sunshine
it
was
richly
set
among
groves
of
trees
dotted
here
and
there
with
the
fantastic
roofs
of
shrines
and
small
palaces
while
further
from
the
mountain
it
was
connected
by
a
long
wooden
bridge
across
the
tola
with
the
city
of
monks
sacred
and
revered
throughout
all
the
east
as
ta
kure
or

here
besides
the
living
buddha
live
whole
throngs
of
secondary
miracle
workers
prophets
sorcerers
and
wonderful
doctors
all
these
people
have
divine
origin
and
are
honored
as
living
gods
at
the
left
on
the
high
plateau
stands
an
old
monastery
with
a
huge
dark

which
is
known
as

from

down
below
the
monastery
is
the
foreign
settlement
where
the
russian
foreign
and
richest
chinese
merchants
live
and
where
the
and
crowded
oriental
bazaar
carries
forward
its
bustling
life
a
kilometre
away
the
greyish
enclosure
of
maimachen
surrounds
the
remaining
chinese
trading
establishments
while
farther
on
one
sees
a
long
row
of
russian
private
houses
a
hospital
church
prison
and
last
of
all
the
awkward
red
brick
building
that
was
formerly
the
russian
consulate
we
were
already
within
a
short
distance
of
the
monastery
when
i
noticed
several
mongol
soldiers
in
the
mouth
of
a
ravine
nearby
dragging
back
and
concealing
in
the
ravine
three
dead
bodies
what
are
they
doing
i
asked
the
cossacks
only
smiled
without
answering
suddenly
they
straightened
up
with
a
sharp
salute
out
of
the
ravine
came
a
small
stocky
mongolian
pony
with
a
short
man
in
the
saddle
as
he
passed
us
i
noticed
the
epaulets
of
a
colonel
and
the
green
cap
with
a
visor
he
examined
me
with
cold
colorless
eyes
from
under
dense
brows
as
he
went
on
ahead
he
took
off
his
cap
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
bald
head
my
eyes
were
struck
by
the
strange
undulating
line
of
his
skull
it
was
the
man
with
the
head
like
a
saddle
against
whom
i
had
been
warned
by
the
old
fortune
teller
at
the
last
ourton
outside
van
kure
who
is
this
officer
i
inquired
although
he
was
already
quite
a
distance
in
front
of
us
the
cossacks
whispered
colonel
sepailoff
commandant
of
urga
colonel
sepailoff
the
darkest
person
on
the
canvas
of
mongolian
events
formerly
a
mechanician
afterwards
a
gendarme
he
had
gained
quick
promotion
under
the
czar
s
regime
he
was
always
nervously
jerking
and
wriggling
his
body
and
talking
ceaselessly
making
most
unattractive
sounds
in
his
throat
and
sputtering
with
saliva
all
over
his
lips
his
whole
face
often
contracted
with
spasms
he
was
mad
and
baron
ungern
twice
appointed
a
commission
of
surgeons
to
examine
him
and
ordered
him
to
rest
in
the
hope
he
could
rid
the
man
of
his
evil
genius
undoubtedly
sepailoff
was
a
sadist
i
heard
afterwards
that
he
himself
executed
the
condemned
people
joking
and
singing
as
he
did
his
work
dark
terrifying
tales
were
current
about
him
in
urga
he
was
a
bloodhound
fastening
his
victims
with
the
jaws
of
death
all
the
glory
of
the
cruelty
of
baron
ungern
belonged
to
sepailoff
afterwards
baron
ungern
once
told
me
in
urga
that
this
sepailoff
annoyed
him
and
that
sepailoff
could
kill
him
just
as
well
as
others
baron
ungern
feared
sepailoff
not
as
a
man
but
dominated
by
his
own
superstition
because
sepailoff
had
found
in
transbaikalia
a
witch
doctor
who
predicted
the
death
of
the
baron
if
he
dismissed
sepailoff
sepailoff
knew
no
pardon
for
bolshevik
nor
for
any
one
connected
with
the
bolsheviki
in
any
way
the
reason
for
his
vengeful
spirit
was
that
the
bolsheviki
had
tortured
him
in
prison
and
after
his
escape
had
killed
all
his
family
he
was
now
taking
his
revenge
i
put
up
with
a
russian
firm
and
was
at
once
visited
by
my
associates
from
uliassutai
who
greeted
me
with
great
joy
because
they
had
been
much
exercised
about
the
events
in
van
kure
and
zain
shabi
when
i
had
bathed
and
spruced
up
i
went
out
with
them
on
the
street
we
entered
the
bazaar
the
whole
market
was
crowded
to
the
lively
colored
groups
of
men
buying
selling
and
shouting
their
wares
the
bright
streamers
of
chinese
cloth
the
strings
of
pearls
the
earrings
and
bracelets
gave
an
air
of
endless
festivity
while
on
another
side
buyers
were
feeling
of
live
sheep
to
see
whether
they
were
fat
or
not
the
butcher
was
cutting
great
pieces
of
mutton
from
the
hanging
carcasses
and
everywhere
these
sons
of
the
plain
were
joking
and
jesting
the
mongolian
women
in
their
huge
coiffures
and
heavy
silver
caps
like
saucers
on
their
heads
were
admiring
the
variegated
silk
ribbons
and
long
chains
of
coral
beads
an
imposing
big
mongol
attentively
examined
a
small
herd
of
splendid
horses
and
bargained
with
the
mongol
zahachine
or
owner
of
the
horses
a
skinny
quick
black
tibetan
who
had
come
to
urga
to
pray
to
the
living
buddha
or
maybe
with
a
secret
message
from
the
other
god
in
lhasa
squatted
and
bargained
for
an
image
of
the
lotus
buddha
carved
in
agate
in
another
corner
a
big
crowd
of
mongols
and
buriats
had
collected
and
surrounded
a
chinese
merchant
selling
finely
painted
of
glass
crystal
porcelain
amethyst
jade
agate
and
nephrite
for
one
of
which
made
of
a
greenish
milky
nephrite
with
regular
brown
veins
running
through
it
and
carved
with
a
dragon
winding
itself
around
a
bevy
of
young
damsels
the
merchant
was
demanding
of
his
mongol
inquirers
ten
young
oxen
and
everywhere
buriats
in
their
long
red
coats
and
small
red
caps
embroidered
with
gold
helped
the
tartars
in
black
overcoats
and
black
velvet
caps
on
the
back
of
their
heads
to
weave
the
pattern
of
this
oriental
human
tapestry
lamas
formed
the
common
background
for
it
all
as
they
wandered
about
in
their
yellow
and
red
robes
with
capes
picturesquely
thrown
over
their
shoulders
and
caps
of
many
forms
some
like
yellow
mushrooms
others
like
the
red
phrygian
bonnets
or
old
greek
helmets
in
red
they
mingled
with
the
crowd
chatting
serenely
and
counting
their
rosaries
telling
fortunes
for
those
who
would
hear
but
chiefly
searching
out
the
rich
mongols
whom
they
could
cure
or
exploit
by
fortune
telling
predictions
or
other
mysteries
of
a
city
of
lamas
simultaneously
religious
and
political
espionage
was
being
carried
out
just
at
this
time
many
mongols
were
arriving
from
inner
mongolia
and
they
were
continuously
surrounded
by
an
invisible
but
numerous
network
of
watching
lamas
over
the
buildings
around
floated
the
russian
chinese
and
mongolian
national
flags
with
a
single
one
of
the
stars
and
stripes
above
a
small
shop
in
the
market
while
over
the
nearby
tents
and
yurtas
streamed
the
ribbons
the
squares
the
circles
and
triangles
of
the
princes
and
private
persons
afflicted
or
dying
from
smallpox
and
leprosy
all
were
mingled
and
mixed
in
one
bright
mass
strongly
lighted
by
the
sun
occasionally
one
saw
the
soldiers
of
baron
ungern
rushing
about
in
long
blue
coats
mongols
and
tibetans
in
red
coats
with
yellow
epaulets
bearing
the
swastika
of
jenghiz
khan
and
the
initials
of
the
living
buddha
and
chinese
soldiers
from
their
detachment
in
the
mongolian
army
after
the
defeat
of
the
chinese
army
two
thousand
of
these
braves
petitioned
the
living
buddha
to
enlist
them
in
his
legions
swearing
fealty
and
faith
to
him
they
were
accepted
and
formed
into
two
regiments
bearing
the
old
chinese
silver
dragons
on
their
caps
and
shoulders
as
we
crossed
this
market
from
around
a
corner
came
a
big
motor
car
with
the
roar
of
a
siren
there
was
baron
ungern
in
the
yellow
silk
mongolian
coat
with
a
blue
girdle
he
was
going
very
fast
but
recognized
me
at
once
stopping
and
getting
out
to
invite
me
to
go
with
him
to
his
yurta
the
baron
lived
in
a
small
simply
arranged
yurta
set
up
in
the
courtyard
of
a
chinese
hong
he
had
his
headquarters
in
two
other
yurtas
nearby
while
his
servants
occupied
one
of
the
chinese
when
i
reminded
him
of
his
promise
to
help
me
to
reach
the
open
ports
the
general
looked
at
me
with
his
bright
eyes
and
spoke
in
french
my
work
here
is
coming
to
an
end
in
nine
days
i
shall
begin
the
war
with
the
bolsheviki
and
shall
go

i
beg
that
you
will
spend
this
time
here
for
many
years
i
have
lived
without
civilized
society
i
am
alone
with
my
thoughts
and
i
would
like
to
have
you
know
them
speaking
with
me
not
as
the
bloody
mad
baron
as
my
enemies
call
me
nor
as
the
severe
grandfather
which
my
officers
and
soldiers
call
me
but
as
an
ordinary
man
who
has
sought
much
and
has
suffered
even
the
baron
reflected
for
some
minutes
and
then
continued
i
have
thought
about
the
further
trip
of
your
group
and
i
shall
arrange
everything
for
you
but
i
ask
you
to
remain
here

nine
what
was
i
to
do

my
hand
warmly
and
ordered

me
about
yourself
and
your
trip

urged
in
response

related
all
that
i
thought
would
interest
him

he
appeared
quite
excited
over
my
tale
now
i
shall
tell
you
about
myself

and
what
i
am
my

surrounded
with
such
hate
and
fear
that
no
one
can
judge
what
is
the
truth
and
what
is
false
what
is
history
and
what
myth
some
time
you
will
write
about
it
remembering
your
trip

and
your
sojourn

from

also
a

the

forced

to
leave
my
regular
profession
to
join
and
fight
with

cossacks
i
have
spent
all
my

in

learning
of

my
grandfather
brought
buddhism
to
us
from

and
my

and
i
accepted
and
professed
it
in

i
tried
to
form
the

for
an
uncompromising
fight
against
the

fell
into

in

we
read
stern
predictions
about
the
time
when
the

there
must
come

and
the
death

i
see
already
this
horror
this
dark
mad
destruction
of
the
door
of
the
yurta
suddenly
swung
open
and
an
adjutant
snapped
into
a
position
of
attention
and
salute
why
do
you
enter
a
room
by
force
the
general
exclaimed
in
anger
your
excellency
our
outpost
on
the
border
has
caught
a
bolshevik
reconnaissance
party
and
brought
them
the
baron
arose
his
eyes
sparkled
and
his
face
contracted
with
spasms
bring
them
in
front
of
my
yurta
he
ordered
all
was
forgotten
the
inspired
speech
the
penetrating
voice
all
were
sunk
in
the
austere
order
of
the
severe
commander
the
baron
put
on
his
cap
caught
up
the
bamboo
tashur
which
he
always
carried
with
him
and
rushed
from
the
yurta
i
followed
him
out
there
in
front
of
the
yurta
stood
six
red
soldiers
surrounded
by
the
cossacks
the
baron
stopped
and
glared
sharply
at
them
for
several
minutes
in
his
face
one
could
see
the
strong
play
of
his
thoughts
afterwards
he
turned
away
from
them
sat
down
on
the
doorstep
of
the
chinese
house
and
for
a
long
time
was
buried
in
thought
then
he
rose
walked
over
to
them
and
with
an
evident
show
of
decisiveness
in
his
movements
touched
all
the
prisoners
on
the
shoulder
with
his
tashur
and
said
you
to
the
left
and
you
to
the
right
as
he
divided
the
squad
into
two
sections
four
on
the
right
and
two
on
the
left
search
those
two
they
must
be
commissars
commanded
the
baron
and
turning
to
the
other
four
asked
are
you
peasants
mobilized
by
the
bolsheviki
just
so
your
excellency
cried
the
frightened
soldiers
go
to
the
commandant
and
tell
him
that
i
have
ordered
you
to
be
enlisted
in
my
troops
on
the
two
to
the
left
they
found
passports
of
commissars
of
the
communist
political
department
the
general
knitted
his
brows
and
slowly
pronounced
the
following
beat
them
to
death
with
sticks
he
turned
and
entered
the
yurta
after
this
our
conversation
did
not
flow
readily
and
so
i
left
the
baron
to
himself
after
dinner
in
the
russian
firm
where
i
was
staying
some
of
ungern
s
officers
came
in
we
were
chatting
animatedly
when
suddenly
we
heard
the
horn
of
an
automobile
which
instantly
threw
the
officers
into
silence
the
general
is
passing
somewhere
near
one
of
them
remarked
in
a
strangely
altered
voice
our
interrupted
conversation
was
soon
resumed
but
not
for
long
the
clerk
of
the
firm
came
running
into
the
room
and
exclaimed
the
baron
he
entered
the
door
but
stopped
on
the
threshold
the
lamps
had
not
yet
been
lighted
and
it
was
getting
dark
inside
but
the
baron
instantly
recognized
us
all
approached
and
kissed
the
hand
of
the
hostess
greeted
everyone
very
cordially
and
accepting
the
cup
of
tea
offered
him
drew
up
to
the
table
to
drink
soon
he
spoke
i
want
to
steal
your
guest
he
said
to
the
hostess
and
then
turning
to
me
asked
do
you
want
to
go
for
a
motor
ride
i
shall
show
you
the
city
and
the
donning
my
coat
i
followed
my
established
custom
and
slipped
my
revolver
into
it
at
which
the
baron
laughed
leave
that
trash
behind
here
you
are
in
safety
besides
you
must
remember
the
prediction
of
narabanchi
hutuktu
that
fortune
will
ever
be
with
all
right
i
answered
also
with
a
laugh
i
remember
very
well
this
prediction
only
i
do
not
know
what
the
hutuktu
thinks
fortune
means
for
me
maybe
it
is
death
like
the
rest
after
my
hard
long
trip
and
i
must
confess
that
i
prefer
to
travel
farther
and
am
not
ready
to
we
went
out
to
the
gate
where
the
big
fiat
stood
with
its
intruding
great
lights
the
chauffeur
officer
sat
at
the
wheel
like
a
statue
and
remained
at
salute
all
the
time
we
were
entering
and
seating
ourselves
to
the
wireless
station
commanded
the
baron
we
veritably
leapt
forward
the
city
swarmed
as
earlier
with
the
oriental
throng
but
its
appearance
now
was
even
more
strange
and
miraculous
in
among
the
noisy
crowd
mongol
buriat
and
tibetan
riders
threaded
swiftly
caravans
of
camels
solemnly
raised
their
heads
as
we
passed
the
wooden
wheels
of
the
mongol
carts
screamed
in
pain
and
all
was
illumined
by
splendid
great
arc
lights
from
the
electric
station
which
baron
ungern
had
ordered
erected
immediately
after
the
capture
of
urga
together
with
a
telephone
system
and
wireless
station
he
also
ordered
his
men
to
clean
and
disinfect
the
city
which
had
probably
not
felt
the
broom
since
the
days
of
jenghiz
khan
he
arranged
an
traffic
between
different
parts
of
the
city
built
bridges
over
the
tola
and
orkhon
published
a
newspaper
arranged
a
veterinary
laboratory
and
hospitals
the
schools
protected
commerce
mercilessly
hanging
russian
and
mongolian
soldiers
for
pillaging
chinese
firms
in
one
of
these
cases
his
commandant
arrested
two
cossacks
and
a
mongol
soldier
who
had
stolen
brandy
from
one
of
the
chinese
shops
and
brought
them
before
him
he
immediately
bundled
them
all
into
his
car
drove
off
to
the
shop
delivered
the
brandy
back
to
the
proprietor
and
as
promptly
ordered
the
mongol
to
hang
one
of
the
russians
to
the
big
gate
of
the
compound
with
this
one
swung
he
commanded
now
hang
the
other
and
this
had
only
just
been
accomplished
when
he
turned
to
the
commandant
and
ordered
him
to
hang
the
mongol
beside
the
other
two
that
seemed
expeditious
and
just
enough
until
the
chinese
proprietor
came
in
dire
distress
to
the
baron
and
plead
with
him
general
baron
general
baron
please
take
those
men
down
from
my
gateway
for
no
one
will
enter
my
shop
after
the
commercial
quarter
was
flashed
past
our
eyes
we
entered
the
russian
settlement
across
a
small
river
several
russian
soldiers
and
four
very
mongolian
women
stood
on
the
bridge
as
we
passed
the
soldiers
snapped
to
salute
like
immobile
statues
and
fixed
their
eyes
on
the
severe
face
of
their
commander
the
women
first
began
to
run
and
shift
about
and
then
infected
by
the
discipline
and
order
of
events
swung
their
hands
up
to
salute
and
stood
as
immobile
as
their
northern
swains
the
baron
looked
at
me
and
laughed
you
see
the
discipline
even
the
mongolian
women
salute
soon
we
were
out
on
the
plain
with
the
car
going
like
an
arrow
with
the
wind
whistling
and
tossing
the
folds
of
our
coats
and
caps
but
baron
ungern
sitting
with
closed
eyes
repeated
faster
faster
for
a
long
time
we
were
both
silent
and
yesterday
i
beat
my
adjutant
for
rushing
into
my
yurta
and
interrupting
my
story
he
said
you
can
finish
it
now
i
answered
and
are
you
not
bored
by
it
well
there
isn
t
much
left
and
this
happens
to
be
the
most
interesting
i
was
telling
you
that
i
wanted
to
found
an
order
of
military
buddhists
in
russia
for
what
for
the
protection
of
the
processes
of
evolution
of
humanity
and
for
the
struggle
against
revolution
because
i
am
certain
that
evolution
leads
to
the
divinity
and
revolution
to
bestiality
but
i
worked
in
russia
in
russia
where
the
peasants
are
rough
untutored
wild
and
constantly
angry
hating
everybody
and
everything
without
understanding
why
they
are
suspicious
and
materialistic
having
no
sacred
ideals
russian
intelligents
live
among
imaginary
ideals
without
realities
they
have
a
strong
capacity
for
criticising
everything
but
they
lack
creative
power
also
they
have
no
will
power
only
the
capacity
for
talking
and
talking
with
the
peasants
they
can
not
like
anything
or
anybody
their
love
and
feelings
are
imaginary
their
thoughts
and
sentiments
pass
without
trace
like
futile
words
my
companions
therefore
soon
began
to
violate
the
regulations
of
the
order
then
i
introduced
the
condition
of
celibacy
the
entire
negation
of
woman
of
the
comforts
of
life
of
superfluities
according
to
the
teachings
of
the
yellow
faith
and
in
order
that
the
russian
might
be
able
to
live
down
his
physical
nature
i
introduced
the
limitless
use
of
alcohol
hasheesh
and
opium
now
for
alcohol
i
hang
my
officers
and
soldiers
then
we
drank
to
the
white
fever
delirium
tremens
i
could
not
organize
the
order
but
i
gathered
round
me
and
developed
three
hundred
men
wholly
bold
and
entirely
ferocious
afterward
they
were
heroes
in
the
war
with
germany
and
later
in
the
fight
against
the
bolsheviki
but
now
only
a
few
the
wireless
excellency
reported
the
chauffeur
turn
in
there
ordered
the
general
on
the
top
of
a
flat
hill
stood
the
big
powerful
radio
station
which
had
been
partially
destroyed
by
the
retreating
chinese
but
reconstructed
by
the
engineers
of
baron
ungern
the
general
perused
the
telegrams
and
handed
them
to
me
they
were
from
moscow
chita
vladivostok
and
peking
on
a
separate
yellow
sheet
were
the
code
messages
which
the
baron
slipped
into
his
pocket
as
he
said
to
me
they
are
from
my
agents
who
are
stationed
in
chita
irkutsk
harbin
and
vladivostok
they
are
all
jews
very
skilled
and
very
bold
men
friends
of
mine
all
i
have
also
one
jewish
officer
vulfovitch
who
commands
my
right
flank
he
is
as
ferocious
as
satan
but
clever
and
brave
now
we
shall
fly
into
once
more
we
rushed
away
sinking
into
the
darkness
of
night
it
was
a
wild
ride
the
car
bounded
over
small
stones
and
ditches
even
taking
narrow
streamlets
as
the
skilled
chauffeur
only
seemed
to
guide
it
round
the
larger
rocks
on
the
plain
as
we
sped
by
i
noticed
several
times
small
bright
flashes
of
fire
which
lasted
but
for
a
second
and
then
were
extinguished
the
eyes
of
wolves
smiled
my
companion
we
have
fed
them
to
satiety
from
the
flesh
of
ourselves
and
our
enemies
he
quietly
interpolated
as
he
turned
to
continue
his
confession
of
faith
during
the
war
we
saw
the
gradual
corruption
of
the
russian
army
and
foresaw
the
treachery
of
russia
to
the
allies
as
well
as
the
approaching
danger
of
revolution
to
counteract
this
latter
a
plan
was
formed
to
join
together
all
the
mongolian
peoples
which
had
not
forgotten
their
ancient
faiths
and
customs
into
one
asiatic
state
consisting
of
autonomous
tribal
units
under
the
moral
and
legislative
leadership
of
china
the
country
of
loftiest
and
most
ancient
culture
into
this
state
must
come
the
chinese
mongols
tibetans
afghans
the
mongol
tribes
of
turkestan
tartars
buriats
kirghiz
and
kalmucks
this
state
must
be
strong
physically
and
morally
and
must
erect
a
barrier
against
revolution
and
carefully
preserve
its
own
spirit
philosophy
and
individual
policy
if
humanity
mad
and
corrupted
continues
to
threaten
the
divine
spirit
in
mankind
to
spread
blood
and
to
obstruct
moral
development
the
asiatic
state
must
terminate
this
movement
decisively
and
establish
a
permanent
firm
peace
this
propaganda
even
during
the
war
made
splendid
progress
among
the
turkomans
kirghiz
buriats
and
mongols
stop
suddenly
shouted
the
the
car
pulled
up
with
a
jerk
the
general
jumped
out
and
called
me
to
follow
we
started
walking
over
the
prairie
and
the
baron
kept
bending
down
all
the
time
as
though
he
were
looking
for
something
on
the
ground
ah
he
murmured
at
last
he
has
gone
away
i
looked
at
him
in
amazement
a
rich
mongol
formerly
had
his
yurta
here
he
was
the
outfitter
for
the
russian
merchant
noskoff
noskoff
was
a
ferocious
man
as
shown
by
the
name
the
mongols
gave
him
he
used
to
have
his
mongol
debtors
beaten
or
imprisoned
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
chinese
authorities
he
ruined
this
mongol
who
lost
everything
and
escaped
to
a
place
thirty
miles
away
but
noskoff
found
him
there
took
all
that
he
had
left
of
cattle
and
horses
and
left
the
mongol
and
his
family
to
die
of
hunger
when
i
captured
urga
this
mongol
appeared
and
brought
with
him
thirty
other
mongol
families
similarly
ruined
by
noskoff
they
demanded
his
death
so
i
hung
satan
anew
the
motor
car
was
rushing
along
sweeping
a
great
circle
on
the
prairie
and
anew
baron
ungern
with
his
sharp
nervous
voice
carried
his
thoughts
round
the
whole
circumference
of
asian
life
russia
turned
traitor
to
france
england
and
america
signed
the
treaty
and
ushered
in
a
reign
of
chaos
we
then
decided
to
mobilize
asia
against
germany
our
envoys
penetrated
mongolia
tibet
turkestan
and
china
at
this
time
the
bolsheviki
began
to
kill
all
the
russian
officers
and
we
were
forced
to
open
civil
war
against
them
giving
up
our
plans
but
we
hope
later
to
awake
all
asia
and
with
their
help
to
bring
peace
and
god
back
to
earth
i
want
to
feel
that
i
have
helped
this
idea
by
the
liberation
of
he
became
silent
and
thought
for
a
moment
but
some
of
my
associates
in
the
movement
do
not
like
me
because
of
my
atrocities
and
severity
he
remarked
in
a
sad
voice
they
can
not
understand
as
yet
that
we
are
not
fighting
a
political
party
but
a
sect
of
murderers
of
all
contemporary
spiritual
culture
why
do
the
italians
execute
the
black
hand
gang
why
are
the
americans
electrocuting
anarchistic
bomb
throwers
and
i
am
not
allowed
to
rid
the
world
of
those
who
would
kill
the
soul
of
the
people
i
a
teuton
descendant
of
crusaders
and
privateers
i
recognize
only
death
for
murderers
return
he
commanded
the
chauffeur
an
hour
and
a
half
later
we
saw
the
electric
lights
of
urga
chapter
xxxvii
the
camp
of
martyrs
near
the
entrance
to
the
town
a
motor
car
stood
before
a
small
house
what
does
that
mean
exclaimed
the
baron
go
over
there
our
car
drew
up
beside
the
other
the
house
door
opened
sharply
several
officers
rushed
out
and
tried
to
hide
stand
commanded
the
general
go
back
they
obeyed
and
he
entered
after
them
leaning
on
his
tashur
as
the
door
remained
open
i
could
see
and
hear
everything
woe
to
them
whispered
the
chauffeur
our
officers
knew
that
the
baron
had
gone
out
of
the
town
with
me
which
means
always
a
long
journey
and
must
have
decided
to
have
a
good
time
he
will
order
them
beaten
to
death
with
i
could
see
the
end
of
the
table
covered
with
bottles
and
tinned
things
at
the
side
two
young
women
were
seated
who
sprang
up
at
the
appearance
of
the
general
i
could
hear
the
hoarse
voice
of
baron
ungern
pronouncing
sharp
short
stern
phrases
your
native
land
is
perishing
the
shame
of
it
is
upon
all
you
russians
and
you
can
not
understand
it
nor
feel
it
you
need
wine
and
women
scoundrels
brutes
one
hundred
fifty
tashur
for
every
man
of
the
voice
fell
to
a
whisper
and
you
mesdames
do
you
not
realize
the
ruin
of
your
people
no
for
you
it
is
of
no
moment
and
have
you
no
feeling
for
your
husbands
at
the
front
who
may
even
now
be
killed
you
are
not
women
i
honor
woman
who
feels
more
deeply
and
strongly
than
man
but
you
are
not
women
listen
to
me
mesdames
once
more
and
i
will
hang
you
he
came
back
to
the
car
and
himself
sounded
the
horn
several
times
immediately
mongol
horsemen
galloped
up
take
these
men
to
the
commandant
i
will
send
my
orders
on
the
way
to
the
baron
s
yurta
we
were
silent
he
was
excited
and
breathed
heavily
lighting
cigarette
after
cigarette
and
throwing
them
aside
after
but
a
single
puff
or
two
take
supper
with
me
he
proposed
he
also
invited
his
chief
of
staff
a
very
retiring
oppressed
but
splendidly
educated
man
the
servants
spread
a
chinese
hot
course
for
us
followed
by
cold
meat
and
fruit
compote
from
california
with
the
inevitable
tea
we
ate
with
chopsticks
the
baron
was
greatly
distraught
very
cautiously
i
began
speaking
of
the
offending
officers
and
tried
to
justify
their
actions
by
the
extremely
trying
circumstances
under
which
they
were
living
they
are
rotten
through
and
through
demoralized
sunk
into
the
depths
murmured
the
general
the
chief
of
staff
helped
me
out
and
at
last
the
baron
directed
him
to
telephone
the
commandant
to
release
these
gentlemen
the
following
day
i
spent
with
my
friends
walking
a
great
deal
about
the
streets
and
watching
their
busy
life
the
great
energy
of
the
baron
demanded
constant
nervous
activity
from
himself
and
every
one
round
him
he
was
everywhere
seeing
everything
but
never
interfering
with
the
work
of
his
subordinate
administrators
every
one
was
at
work
in
the
evening
i
was
invited
by
the
chief
of
staff
to
his
quarters
where
i
met
many
intelligent
officers
i
related
again
the
story
of
my
trip
and
we
were
all
chatting
along
animatedly
when
suddenly
colonel
sepailoff
entered
singing
to
himself
all
the
others
at
once
became
silent
and
one
by
one
under
various
pretexts
they
slipped
out
he
handed
our
host
some
papers
and
turning
to
us
said
i
shall
send
you
for
supper
a
splendid
fish
pie
and
some
hot
tomato
as
he
left
my
host
clasped
his
head
in
desperation
and
said
with
such
scum
of
the
earth
are
we
now
forced
after
this
revolution
to
work
a
few
minutes
later
a
soldier
from
sepailoff
brought
us
a
tureen
full
of
soup
and
the
fish
pie
as
the
soldier
bent
over
the
table
to
set
the
dishes
down
the
chief
motioned
me
with
his
eyes
and
slipped
to
me
the
words
notice
his
when
the
man
went
out
my
host
sat
attentively
listening
until
the
sounds
of
the
man
s
steps
ceased
he
is
sepailoff
s
executioner
who
hangs
and
strangles
the
unfortunate
condemned
then
to
my
amazement
he
began
to
pour
out
the
soup
on
the
ground
beside
the
brazier
and
going
out
of
the
yurta
threw
the
pie
over
the
fence
it
is
sepailoff
s
feast
and
though
it
may
be
very
tasty
it
may
also
be
poison
in
sepailoff
s
house
it
is
dangerous
to
eat
or
drink
distinctly
oppressed
by
these
doings
i
returned
to
my
house
my
host
was
not
yet
asleep
and
met
me
with
a
frightened
look
my
friends
were
also
there
god
be
thanked
they
all
exclaimed
has
nothing
happened
to
you
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
you
see
began
the
host
after
your
departure
a
soldier
came
from
sepailoff
and
took
your
luggage
saying
that
you
had
sent
him
for
it
but
we
knew
what
it
meant
that
they
would
first
search
it
and
afterwards
i
at
once
understood
the
danger
sepailoff
could
place
anything
he
wanted
in
my
luggage
and
afterwards
accuse
me
my
old
friend
the
agronome
and
i
started
at
once
for
sepailoff
s
where
i
left
him
at
the
door
while
i
went
in
and
was
met
by
the
same
soldier
who
had
brought
the
supper
to
us
sepailoff
received
me
immediately
in
answer
to
my
protest
he
said
that
it
was
a
mistake
and
asking
me
to
wait
for
a
moment
went
out
i
waited
five
ten
fifteen
minutes
but
nobody
came
i
knocked
on
the
door
but
no
one
answered
me
then
i
decided
to
go
to
baron
ungern
and
started
for
the
exit
the
door
was
locked
then
i
tried
the
other
door
and
found
that
also
locked
i
had
been
trapped
i
wanted
at
once
to
whistle
to
my
friend
but
just
then
noticed
a
telephone
on
the
wall
and
called
up
baron
ungern
in
a
few
minutes
he
appeared
together
with
sepailoff
what
is
this
he
asked
sepailoff
in
a
severe
threatening
voice
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
struck
him
a
blow
with
his
tashur
that
sent
him
to
the
floor
we
went
out
and
the
general
ordered
my
luggage
produced
then
he
brought
me
to
his
own
yurta
live
here
now
he
said
i
am
very
glad
of
this
accident
he
remarked
with
a
smile
for
now
i
can
say
all
that
i
want
this
drew
from
me
the
question
may
i
describe
all
that
i
have
heard
and
seen
here
he
thought
a
moment
before
replying
give
me
your
i
handed
him
the
album
with
my
sketches
of
the
trip
and
he
wrote
therein
after
my
death
baron
but
i
am
older
than
you
and
i
shall
die
before
you
i
remarked
he
shut
his
eyes
bowed
his
head
and
whispered
oh
no
one
hundred
thirty
days
yet
and
it
is
finished
then
nirvana
how
wearied
i
am
with
sorrow
woe
and
hate
we
were
silent
for
a
long
time
i
felt
that
i
had
now
a
mortal
enemy
in
colonel
sepailoff
and
that
i
should
get
out
of
urga
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
it
was
two
o
clock
at
night
suddenly
baron
ungern
stood
up
let
us
go
to
the
great
good
buddha
he
said
with
a
countenance
held
in
deep
thought
and
with
eyes
aflame
his
whole
face
contracted
by
a
mournful
bitter
smile
he
ordered
the
car
brought
thus
lived
this
camp
of
martyrs
refugees
pursued
by
events
to
their
tryst
with
death
driven
on
by
the
hate
and
contempt
of
this
offspring
of
teutons
and
privateers
and
he
martyring
them
knew
neither
day
nor
night
of
peace
fired
by
impelling
poisonous
thoughts
he
tormented
himself
with
the
pains
of
a
titan
knowing
that
every
day
in
this
shortening
chain
of
one
hundred
thirty
links
brought
him
nearer
to
the
precipice
called
chapter
xxxviii
before
the
face
of
buddha
as
we
came
to
the
monastery
we
left
the
automobile
and
dipped
into
the
labyrinth
of
narrow
alleyways
until
at
last
we
were
before
the
greatest
temple
of
urga
with
the
tibetan
walls
and
windows
and
its
pretentious
chinese
roof
a
single
lantern
burned
at
the
entrance
the
heavy
gate
with
the
bronze
and
iron
trimmings
was
shut
when
the
general
struck
the
big
brass
gong
hanging
by
the
gate
frightened
monks
began
running
up
from
all
directions
and
seeing
the
general
baron
fell
to
the
earth
in
fear
of
raising
their
heads
get
up
said
the
baron
and
let
us
into
the
temple
the
inside
was
like
that
of
all
lama
temples
the
same
flags
with
the
prayers
symbolic
signs
and
the
images
of
holy
saints
the
big
bands
of
silk
cloth
hanging
from
the
ceiling
the
images
of
the
gods
and
goddesses
on
both
sides
of
the
approach
to
the
altar
were
the
low
red
benches
for
the
lamas
and
choir
on
the
altar
small
lamps
threw
their
rays
on
the
gold
and
silver
vessels
and
candlesticks
behind
it
hung
a
heavy
yellow
silk
curtain
with
tibetan
inscriptions
the
lamas
drew
the
curtain
aside
out
of
the
dim
light
from
the
flickering
lamps
gradually
appeared
the
great
gilded
statue
of
buddha
seated
in
the
golden
lotus
the
face
of
the
god
was
indifferent
and
calm
with
only
a
soft
gleam
of
light
animating
it
on
either
side
he
was
guarded
by
many
thousands
of
lesser
buddhas
brought
by
the
faithful
as
offerings
in
prayer
the
baron
struck
the
gong
to
attract
great
buddha
s
attention
to
his
prayer
and
threw
a
handful
of
coins
into
the
large
bronze
bowl
and
then
this
scion
of
crusaders
who
had
read
all
the
philosophers
of
the
west
closed
his
eyes
placed
his
hands
together
before
his
face
and
prayed
i
noticed
a
black
rosary
on
his
left
wrist
he
prayed
about
ten
minutes
afterwards
he
led
me
to
the
other
end
of
the
monastery
and
during
our
passage
said
to
me
i
do
not
like
this
temple
it
is
new
erected
by
the
lamas
when
the
living
buddha
became
blind
i
do
not
find
on
the
face
of
the
golden
buddha
either
tears
hopes
distress
or
thanks
of
the
people
they
have
not
yet
had
time
to
leave
these
traces
on
the
face
of
the
god
we
shall
go
now
to
the
old
shrine
of
this
was
a
small
building
blackened
with
age
and
resembling
a
tower
with
a
plain
round
roof
the
doors
stood
open
at
both
sides
of
the
door
were
prayer
wheels
ready
to
be
spun
over
it
a
slab
of
copper
with
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
inside
two
monks
who
were
intoning
the
sacred
sutras
did
not
lift
their
eyes
as
we
entered
the
general
approached
them
and
said
cast
the
dice
for
the
number
of
my
days
the
priests
brought
two
bowls
with
many
dice
therein
and
rolled
them
out
on
their
low
table
the
baron
looked
and
reckoned
with
them
the
sum
before
he
spoke
one
hundred
thirty
again
one
hundred
thirty
approaching
the
altar
carrying
an
ancient
stone
statue
of
buddha
brought
all
the
way
from
india
he
again
prayed
as
day
dawned
we
wandered
out
through
the
monastery
visited
all
the
temples
and
shrines
the
museum
of
the
medical
school
the
astrological
tower
and
then
the
court
where
the
bandi
and
young
lamas
have
their
daily
morning
wrestling
exercises
in
other
places
the
lamas
were
practising
with
the
bow
and
arrow
some
of
the
higher
lamas
feasted
us
with
hot
mutton
tea
and
wild
onions
after
we
returned
to
the
yurta
i
tried
to
sleep
but
in
vain
too
many
different
questions
were
troubling
me
where
am
i
in
what
epoch
am
i
living
i
knew
not
but
i
dimly
felt
the
unseen
touch
of
some
great
idea
some
enormous
plan
some
indescribable
human
woe
after
our
noon
meal
the
general
said
he
wanted
to
introduce
me
to
the
living
buddha
it
is
so
difficult
to
secure
audience
with
the
living
buddha
that
i
was
very
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
offered
me
our
auto
soon
drew
up
at
the
gate
of
the
red
and
white
striped
wall
surrounding
the
palace
of
the
god
two
hundred
lamas
in
yellow
and
red
robes
rushed
to
greet
the
arriving
chiang
chun
general
with
the
respectful
whisper
khan
god
of
war
as
a
regiment
of
formal
ushers
they
led
us
to
a
spacious
great
hall
softened
by
its
heavy
carved
doors
opened
to
the
interior
parts
of
the
palace
in
the
depths
of
the
hall
stood
a
dais
with
the
throne
covered
with
yellow
silk
cushions
the
back
of
the
throne
was
red
inside
a
gold
framing
at
either
side
stood
yellow
silk
screens
set
in
highly
ornamented
frames
of
black
chinese
wood
while
against
the
walls
at
either
side
of
the
throne
stood
glass
cases
filled
with
varied
objects
from
china
japan
india
and
russia
i
noticed
also
among
them
a
pair
of
exquisite
marquis
and
marquises
in
the
fine
porcelain
of
sevres
before
the
throne
stood
a
long
low
table
at
which
eight
noble
mongols
were
seated
their
chairman
a
highly
esteemed
old
man
with
a
clever
energetic
face
and
with
large
penetrating
eyes
his
appearance
reminded
me
of
the
authentic
wooden
images
of
the
buddhist
holymen
with
eyes
of
precious
stones
which
i
saw
at
the
tokyo
imperial
museum
in
the
department
devoted
to
buddhism
where
the
japanese
show
the
ancient
statues
of
amida
the
goddess
kwannon
and
the
jolly
old
hotei
this
man
was
the
hutuktu
jahantsi
chairman
of
the
mongolian
council
of
ministers
and
honored
and
revered
far
beyond
the
bournes
of
mongolia
the
others
were
the
ministers
khans
and
the
highest
princes
of
khalkha
jahantsi
hutuktu
invited
baron
ungern
to
the
place
at
his
side
while
they
brought
in
a
european
chair
for
me
baron
ungern
announced
to
the
council
of
ministers
through
an
interpreter
that
he
would
leave
mongolia
in
a
few
days
and
urged
them
to
protect
the
freedom
won
for
the
lands
inhabited
by
the
successors
of
jenghiz
khan
whose
soul
still
lives
and
calls
upon
the
mongols
to
become
anew
a
powerful
people
and
reunite
again
into
one
great
state
all
the
asian
kingdoms
he
had
ruled
the
general
rose
and
all
the
others
followed
him
he
took
leave
of
each
one
separately
and
sternly
only
before
jahantsi
lama
he
bent
low
while
the
hutuktu
placed
his
hands
on
the
baron
s
head
and
blessed
him
from
the
council
chamber
we
passed
at
once
to
the
russian
style
house
which
is
the
personal
dwelling
of
the
living
buddha
the
house
was
wholly
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
red
and
yellow
lamas
servants
councilors
of
bogdo
officials
fortune
tellers
doctors
and
favorites
from
the
front
entrance
stretched
a
long
red
rope
whose
outer
end
was
thrown
over
the
wall
beside
the
gate
crowds
of
pilgrims
crawling
up
on
their
knees
touch
this
end
of
the
rope
outside
the
gate
and
hand
the
monk
a
silken
hatyk
or
a
bit
of
silver
this
touching
of
the
rope
whose
inner
end
is
in
the
hand
of
the
bogdo
establishes
direct
communication
with
the
holy
incarnated
living
god
a
current
of
blessing
is
supposed
to
flow
through
this
cable
of
camel
s
wool
and
horse
hair
any
mongol
who
has
touched
the
mystic
rope
receives
and
wears
about
his
neck
a
red
band
as
the
sign
of
his
accomplished
pilgrimage
i
had
heard
very
much
about
the
bogdo
khan
before
this
opportunity
to
see
him
i
had
heard
of
his
love
of
alcohol
which
had
brought
on
blindness
about
his
leaning
toward
exterior
western
culture
and
about
his
wife
drinking
deep
with
him
and
receiving
in
his
name
numerous
delegations
and
envoys
in
the
room
which
the
bogdo
used
as
his
private
study
where
two
lama
secretaries
watched
day
and
night
over
the
chest
that
contained
his
great
seals
there
was
the
severest
simplicity
on
a
low
plain
chinese
lacquered
table
lay
his
writing
implements
a
case
of
seals
given
by
the
chinese
government
and
by
the
dalai
lama
and
wrapped
in
a
cloth
of
yellow
silk
nearby
was
a
low
easy
chair
a
bronze
brazier
with
an
iron
stovepipe
leading
up
from
it
on
the
walls
were
the
signs
of
the
swastika
tibetan
and
mongolian
inscriptions
behind
the
easy
chair
a
small
altar
with
a
golden
statue
of
buddha
before
which
two
tallow
lamps
were
burning
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
thick
yellow
carpet
when
we
entered
only
the
two
lama
secretaries
were
there
for
the
living
buddha
was
in
the
small
private
shrine
in
an
adjoining
chamber
where
no
one
is
allowed
to
enter
save
the
bogdo
khan
himself
and
one
lama
who
cares
for
the
temple
arrangements
and
assists
the
living
buddha
during
his
prayers
of
solitude
the
secretary
told
us
that
the
bogdo
had
been
greatly
excited
this
morning
at
noon
he
had
entered
his
shrine
for
a
long
time
the
voice
of
the
head
of
the
yellow
faith
was
heard
in
earnest
prayer
and
after
his
another
unknown
voice
came
clearly
forth
in
the
shrine
had
taken
place
a
conversation
between
the
buddha
on
earth
and
the
buddha
of
heaven
thus
the
lamas
phrased
it
to
us
let
us
wait
a
little
the
baron
proposed
perhaps
he
will
soon
come
as
we
waited
the
general
began
telling
me
about
jahantsi
lama
saying
that
when
jahantsi
is
calm
he
is
an
ordinary
man
but
when
he
is
disturbed
and
thinks
very
deeply
a
nimbus
appears
about
his
head
after
half
an
hour
the
lama
secretaries
suddenly
showed
signs
of
deep
fear
and
began
listening
closely
by
the
entrance
to
the
shrine
shortly
they
fell
on
their
faces
on
the
ground
the
door
slowly
opened
and
there
entered
the
emperor
of
mongolia
the
living
buddha
his
holiness
bogdo
djebtsung
damba
hutuktu
khan
of
outer
mongolia
he
was
a
stout
old
man
with
a
heavy
shaven
face
resembling
those
of
the
cardinals
of
rome
he
was
dressed
in
the
yellow
silken
mongolian
coat
with
a
black
binding
the
eyes
of
the
blind
man
stood
widely
open
fear
and
amazement
were
pictured
in
them
he
lowered
himself
heavily
into
the
easy
chair
and
whispered
write
a
secretary
immediately
took
paper
and
a
chinese
pen
as
the
bogdo
began
to
dictate
his
vision
very
complicated
and
far
from
clear
he
finished
with
the
following
words
this
i
bogdo
hutuktu
khan
saw
speaking
with
the
great
wise
buddha
surrounded
by
the
good
and
evil
spirits
wise
lamas
hutuktus
kanpos
marambas
and
holy
gheghens
give
the
answer
to
my
vision
as
he
finished
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
head
and
asked
who
were
present
khan
chiang
chin
baron
ungern
and
a
stranger
one
of
the
secretaries
answered
on
his
knees
the
general
presented
me
to
the
bogdo
who
bowed
his
head
as
a
sign
of
greeting
they
began
speaking
together
in
low
tones
through
the
open
door
i
saw
a
part
of
the
shrine
i
made
out
a
big
table
with
a
heap
of
books
on
it
some
open
and
others
lying
on
the
floor
below
a
brazier
with
the
red
charcoal
in
it
a
basket
containing
the
shoulder
blades
and
entrails
of
sheep
for
telling
fortunes
soon
the
baron
rose
and
bowed
before
the
bogdo
the
tibetan
placed
his
hands
on
the
baron
s
head
and
whispered
a
prayer
then
he
took
from
his
own
neck
a
heavy
ikon
and
hung
it
around
that
of
the
baron
you
will
not
die
but
you
will
be
incarnated
in
the
highest
form
of
being
remember
that
incarnated
god
of
war
khan
of
grateful
mongolia
i
understood
that
the
living
buddha
blessed
the
bloody
general
before
death
during
the
next
two
days
i
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
the
living
buddha
three
times
together
with
a
friend
of
the
bogdo
the
buriat
prince
djam
bolon
i
shall
describe
these
visits
in
part
iv
baron
ungern
organized
the
trip
for
me
and
my
party
to
the
shore
of
the
pacific
we
were
to
go
on
camels
to
northern
manchuria
because
there
it
was
easy
to
avoid
cavilling
with
the
chinese
authorities
so
badly
oriented
in
the
international
relationship
with
poland
having
sent
a
letter
from
uliassutai
to
the
french
legation
at
peking
and
bearing
with
me
a
letter
from
the
chinese
chamber
of
commerce
expressing
thanks
for
the
saving
of
uliassutai
from
a
pogrom
i
intended
to
make
for
the
nearest
station
on
the
chinese
eastern
railway
and
from
there
proceed
to
peking
the
danish
merchant
olufsen
was
to
have
traveled
out
with
me
and
also
a
learned
lama
turgut
who
was
headed
for
china
never
shall
i
forget
the
night
of
may
to
of
after
dinner
baron
ungern
proposed
that
we
go
to
the
yurta
of
djam
bolon
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
on
the
first
day
after
my
arrival
in
urga
his
yurta
was
placed
on
a
raised
wooden
platform
in
a
compound
located
behind
the
russian
settlement
two
buriat
officers
met
us
and
took
us
in
djam
bolon
was
a
man
of
middle
age
tall
and
thin
with
an
unusually
long
face
before
the
great
war
he
had
been
a
simple
shepherd
but
had
fought
together
with
baron
ungern
on
the
german
front
and
afterwards
against
the
bolsheviki
he
was
a
grand
duke
of
the
buriats
the
successor
of
former
buriat
kings
who
had
been
dethroned
by
the
russian
government
after
their
attempt
to
establish
the
independence
of
the
buriat
people
the
servants
brought
us
dishes
with
nuts
raisins
dates
and
cheese
and
served
us
tea
this
is
the
last
night
djam
bolon
said
baron
ungern
you
promised
me
i
remember
answered
the
buriat
all
is
for
a
long
time
i
listened
to
their
reminiscences
about
former
battles
and
friends
who
had
been
lost
the
clock
pointed
to
midnight
when
djam
bolon
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
yurta
i
want
to
have
my
fortune
told
once
more
said
baron
ungern
as
though
he
were
justifying
himself
for
the
good
of
our
cause
it
is
too
early
for
me
to
die
djam
bolon
came
back
with
a
little
woman
of
middle
years
who
squatted
down
eastern
style
before
the
brazier
bowed
low
and
began
to
stare
at
baron
ungern
her
face
was
whiter
narrower
and
thinner
than
that
of
a
mongol
woman
her
eyes
were
black
and
sharp
her
dress
resembled
that
of
a
gypsy
woman
afterwards
i
learned
that
she
was
a
famous
fortune
teller
and
prophet
among
the
buriats
the
daughter
of
a
gypsy
woman
and
a
buriat
she
drew
a
small
bag
very
slowly
from
her
girdle
took
from
it
some
small
bird
bones
and
a
handful
of
dry
grass
she
began
whispering
at
intervals
unintelligible
words
as
she
threw
occasional
handfuls
of
the
grass
into
the
fire
which
gradually
filled
the
tent
with
a
soft
fragrance
i
felt
a
distinct
palpitation
of
my
heart
and
a
swimming
in
my
head
after
the
fortune
teller
had
burned
all
her
grass
she
placed
the
bird
bones
on
the
charcoal
and
turned
them
over
again
and
again
with
a
small
pair
of
bronze
pincers
as
the
bones
blackened
she
began
to
examine
them
and
then
suddenly
her
face
took
on
an
expression
of
fear
and
pain
she
nervously
tore
off
the
kerchief
which
bound
her
head
and
contracted
with
convulsions
began
snapping
out
short
sharp
phrases
i
see
i
see
the
god
of
war
his
life
runs
out
horribly
after
it
a
shadow
black
like
the
night
shadow
one
hundred
thirty
steps
remain
beyond
darkness
nothing
i
see
nothing
the
god
of
war
has
disappeared
baron
ungern
dropped
his
head
the
woman
fell
over
on
her
back
with
her
arms
stretched
out
she
had
fainted
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
noticed
once
a
bright
pupil
of
one
of
her
eyes
showing
from
under
the
closed
lashes
two
buriats
carried
out
the
lifeless
form
after
which
a
long
silence
reigned
in
the
yurta
of
the
buriat
prince
baron
ungern
finally
got
up
and
began
to
walk
around
the
brazier
whispering
to
himself
afterwards
he
stopped
and
began
speaking
rapidly
i
shall
die
i
shall
die
but
no
matter
no
matter
the
cause
has
been
launched
and
will
not
die
i
know
the
roads
this
cause
will
travel
the
tribes
of
jenghiz
khan
s
successors
are
awakened
nobody
shall
extinguish
the
fire
in
the
heart
of
the
mongols
in
asia
there
will
be
a
great
state
from
the
pacific
and
indian
oceans
to
the
shore
of
the
volga
the
wise
religion
of
buddha
shall
run
to
the
north
and
the
west
it
will
be
the
victory
of
the
spirit
a
conqueror
and
leader
will
appear
stronger
and
more
stalwart
than
jenghiz
khan
and
ugadai
he
will
be
more
clever
and
more
merciful
than
sultan
baber
and
he
will
keep
power
in
his
hands
until
the
happy
day
when
from
his
subterranean
capital
shall
emerge
the
king
of
the
world
why
why
shall
i
not
be
in
the
first
ranks
of
the
warriors
of
buddhism
why
has
karma
decided
so
but
so
it
must
be
and
russia
must
first
wash
herself
from
the
insult
of
revolution
purifying
herself
with
blood
and
death
and
all
people
accepting
communism
must
perish
with
their
families
in
order
that
all
their
offspring
may
be
rooted
out
the
baron
raised
his
hand
above
his
head
and
shook
it
as
though
he
were
giving
his
orders
and
bequests
to
some
invisible
person
day
was
dawning
my
time
has
come
said
the
general
in
a
little
while
i
shall
leave
he
quickly
and
firmly
shook
hands
with
us
and
said
for
all
time
i
shall
die
a
horrible
death
but
the
world
has
never
seen
such
a
terror
and
such
a
sea
of
blood
as
it
shall
now
see
the
door
of
the
yurta
slammed
shut
and
he
was
gone
i
never
saw
him
again
i
must
go
also
for
i

djam

pronounced
this
last
with
an
accent
on
every
word
i
did
not
question
him
about
it
as
i
was
accustomed
to
the
mystery
of
this
country
of
the
mysteries
of
good
and
evil

war
minister
a
stout
young
mongol
joined

caravan
when
we
had
gone
about
six
miles
from
the
city
we
saw
an
automobile
coming
up
behind
us
the
lama
shrunk
up
inside
his
coat
and
looked
at
me
with
fear
i
felt
the
now
familiar
atmosphere
of
danger
and
so
opened
my
holster
and
threw
over
the
safety
catch
of
my
revolver
soon
the
motor
stopped
alongside
our
caravan
in
it
sat
sepailoff
with
a
smiling
face
and
beside
him
his
two
executioners

evening
and
gave
sepailoff
directions
as
to
the
road
the
motor
rushed
away
and
when
it
had
topped
the
pass
he
ordered
one
of
the
mongols
to
gallop
forward
to
see
whether
it
had
not
stopped
somewhere
near
the
other
side
the
mongol
whipped
his
steed
and
sped
away

followed
slowly

the
matter

asked

me
that

reported
that
the
motor
car
had
gone
on
out
of
sight
now
said
the
minister
we
shall
take
quite
another
route
so
that
the
colonel
will
wait
in
vain
for
us
at
we
turned
north
at
undur
dobo
and
at
night
were
in
the
camp
of
a
local
prince
here
we
took
leave
of
our
minister
received
splendid
fresh
horses
and
quickly
continued
our
trip
to
the
east
leaving
behind
us
the
man
with
the
head
like
a
saddle
against
whom
i
had
been
warned
by
the
old
fortune
teller
in
the
vicinity
of
van
kure
after
twelve
days
without
further
adventures
we
reached
the
first
railway
station
on
the
chinese
eastern
railway
from
where
i
traveled
in
unbelievable
luxury
to
peking
surrounded
by
the
comforts
and
conveniences
of
the
splendid
hotel
at
peking
while
shedding
all
the
attributes
of
traveler
hunter
and
warrior
i
could
not
however
throw
off
the
spell
of
those
nine
days
spent
in
urga
where
i
had
daily
met
baron
ungern
incarnated
god
of
the
newspapers
carrying
accounts
of
the
bloody
march
of
the
baron
through
transbaikalia
brought
the
pictures
ever
fresh
to
my
mind
even
now
although
more
than
seven
months
have
elapsed
i
can
not
forget
those
nights
of
madness
inspiration
and
hate
the
predictions
are
fulfilled
approximately
one
hundred
thirty
days
afterwards
baron
ungern
was
captured
by
the
bolsheviki
through
the
treachery
of
his
officers
and
it
is
reported
was
executed
at
the
end
of
september
baron
ungern
von
sternberg
like
a
bloody
storm
of
avenging
karma
he
spread
over
central
asia
what
did
he
leave
behind
him
the
severe
order
to
his
soldiers
closing
with
the
words
of
the
revelations
of
john
let
no
one
check
the
revenge
against
the
corrupter
and
slayer
of
the
soul
of
the
russian
people
revolution
must
be
eradicated
from
the
world
against
it
the
revelations
of
john
have
warned
us
thus
and
the
woman
was
arrayed
in
purple
and
scarlet
and
decked
with
gold
and
precious
stones
and
pearls
having
in
her
hand
a
golden
cup
full
of
abominations
even
the
unclean
things
of
her
fornication
and
upon
her
forehead
a
name
written
mystery
babylon
the
great
the
mother
of
the
harlots
and
of
the
abominations
of
the
earth
and
i
saw
the
woman
drunken
with
the
blood
of
the
saints
and
with
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
of
it
is
a
human
document
a
document
of
russian
and
perhaps
of
world
tragedy
but
there
remained
another
and
more
important
trace
in
the
mongol
yurtas
and
at
the
fires
of
buriat
mongol
djungar
kirkhiz
kalmuck
and
tibetan
shepherds
still
speak
the
legend
born
of
this
son
of
crusaders
and
privateers
from
the
north
a
white
warrior
came
and
called
on
the
mongols
to
break
their
chains
of
slavery
which
fell
upon
our
freed
soil
this
white
warrior
was
the
incarnated
jenghiz
khan
and
he
predicted
the
coming
of
the
greatest
of
all
mongols
who
will
spread
the
fair
faith
of
buddha
and
the
glory
and
power
of
the
offspring
of
jenghiz
ugadai
and
kublai
khan
so
it
shall
be
asia
is
awakened
and
her
sons
utter
bold
words
it
were
well
for
the
peace
of
the
world
if
they
go
forth
as
disciples
of
the
wise
creators
ugadai
and
sultan
baber
rather
than
under
the
spell
of
the
bad
demons
of
the
destructive

surrounds
the
living
god
of

it
is
little
wonder
that
his
name
is
honored
along
the
volga
in
siberia
arabia
between
the
tigris
and
euphrates
in
and
on
the
shores
of
the
arctic
ocean
during
my
stay
in
urga
i
visited
the
abode
of
the
living
buddha
several
times
spoke
with
him
and
observed
his
life
his
favorite
learned
marambas
gave
me
long
accounts
of
him
i
saw
him
reading
horoscopes
i
heard
his
predictions
i
looked
over
his
archives
of
ancient
books
and
the
manuscripts
containing
the
lives
and
predictions
of
all
the
bogdo
khans
the
lamas
were
very
frank
and
open
with
me
because
the
letter
of
the
hutuktu
of
narabanchi
won
for
me
their
confidence
the
personality
of
the
living
buddha
is
double
just
as
everything
in
lamaism
is
double
clever
penetrating
energetic
he
at
the
same
time
indulges
in
the
drunkenness
which
has
brought
on
blindness
when
he
became
blind
the
lamas
were
thrown
into
a
state
of
desperation
some
of
them
maintained
that
bogdo
khan
must
be
poisoned
and
another
incarnate
buddha
set
in
his
place
while
the
others
pointed
out
the
great
merits
of
the
pontiff
in
the
eyes
of
mongolians
and
the
followers
of
the
yellow
faith
they
finally
decided
to
propitiate
the
gods
by
building
a
great
temple
with
a
gigantic
statue
of
buddha
however
this
did
not
help
the
bogdo
s
sight
but
the
whole
incident
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
hurrying
on
to
their
higher
life
those
among
the
lamas
who
had
shown
too
much
radicalism
in
their
proposed
method
of
solving
his
problem
he
never
ceases
to
ponder
upon
the
cause
of
the
church
and
of
mongolia
and
at
the
same
time
likes
to
indulge
himself
with
useless
trifles
he
amuses
himself
with
artillery
a
retired
russian
officer
presented
him
with
two
old
guns
for
which
the
donor
received
the
title
of
tumbaiir
hun
that
is
prince
on
holidays
these
cannon
were
fired
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
blind
man
motorcars
gramophones
telephones
crystals
porcelains
pictures
perfumes
musical
instruments
rare
animals
and
birds
elephants
himalayan
bears
monkeys
indian
snakes
and
parrots
all
these
were
in
the
palace
of
the
god
but
all
were
soon
cast
aside
and
forgotten
to
urga
come
pilgrims
and
presents
from
all
the
lamaite
and
buddhist
world
once
the
treasurer
of
the
palace
the
honorable
balma
dorji
took
me
into
the
great
hall
where
the
presents
were
kept
it
was
a
most
unique
museum
of
precious
articles
here
were
gathered
together
rare
objects
unknown
to
the
museums
of
europe
the
treasurer
as
he
opened
a
case
with
a
silver
lock
said
to
me
these
are
pure
gold
nuggets
from
bei
kem
here
are
black
sables
from
kemchick
these
the
miraculous
deer
horns
this
a
box
sent
by
the
orochons
and
filled
with
precious
ginseng
roots
and
fragrant
musk
this
a
bit
of
amber
from
the
coast
of
the
frozen
sea
and
it
weighs
lans
about
ten
pounds
these
are
precious
stones
from
india
fragrant
zebet
and
carved
ivory
from
he
showed
the
exhibits
and
talked
of
them
for
a
long
time
and
evidently
enjoyed
the
telling
and
really
it
was
wonderful
before
my
eyes
lay
the
bundles
of
rare
furs
white
beaver
black
sables
white
blue
and
black
fox
and
black
panthers
small
beautifully
carved
tortoise
shell
boxes
containing
hatyks
ten
or
fifteen
yards
long
woven
from
indian
silk
as
fine
as
the
webs
of
the
spider
small
bags
made
of
golden
thread
filled
with
pearls
the
presents
of
indian
rajahs
precious
rings
with
sapphires
and
rubies
from

and
india
big
pieces
of

ornamented
with

and

bright

sewn
with
gold
and
silver
thread
walrus
tusks
carved
in
by
the
primitive
artists
on
the
shores
of
the
behring
sea
and
much
more
that
one
can
not
recall
or
recount
in
a
separate
room
stood
the
cases
with
the
statues
of
buddha
made
of
gold
silver
bronze
ivory
coral
mother
of
pearl
and
from
a
rare
colored
and
fragrant
species
of
wood
you
know
when
conquerors
come
into
a
country
where
the
gods
are
honored
they
break
the
images
and
throw
them
down
so
it
was
more
than
three
hundred
years
ago
when
the
kalmucks
went
into
tibet
and
the
same
was
repeated
in
peking
when
the
european
troops
looted
the
place
in
but
do
you
know
why
this
is
done
take
one
of
the
statues
and
examine
i
picked
up
one
nearest
the
edge
a
wooden
buddha
and
began
examining
it
inside
something
was
loose
and
rattled
do
you
hear
it
the
lama
asked
these
are
precious
stones
and
bits
of
gold
the
entrails
of
the
god
this
is
the
reason
why
the
conquerors
at
once
break
up
the
statues
of
the
gods
many
famous
precious
stones
have
appeared
from
the
interior
of
the
statues
of
the
gods
in
india
babylon
and
some
rooms
were
devoted
to
the
library
where
manuscripts
and
volumes
of
different
epochs
in
different
languages
and
with
many
diverse
themes
fill
the
shelves
some
of
them
are
mouldering
or
pulverizing
away
and
the
lamas
cover
these
now
with
a
solution
which
partially
solidifies
like
a
jelly
to
protect
what
remains
from
the
ravages
of
the
air
there
also
we
saw
tablets
of
clay
with
the
cuneiform
inscriptions
evidently
from
babylonia
chinese
indian
and
tibetan
books
shelved
beside
those
of
mongolia
tomes
of
the
ancient
pure
buddhism
books
of
the
red
caps
or
corrupt
buddhism
books
of
the
yellow
or
lamaite
buddhism
books
of
traditions
legends
and
parables
groups
of
lamas
were
perusing
studying
and
copying
these
books
preserving
and
spreading
the
ancient
wisdom
for
their
successors
one
department
is
devoted
to
the
mysterious
books
on
magic
the
historical
lives
and
works
of
all
the
living
buddhas
with
the
bulls
of
the
dalai
lama
of
the
pontiff
from
tashi
lumpo
of
the
hutuktu
of
utai
in
china
of
the
pandita
gheghen
of
dolo
nor
in
inner
mongolia
and
of
the
hundred
chinese
wise
men
only
the
bogdo
hutuktu
and
maramba
can
enter
this
room
of
mysterious
lore
the
keys
to
it
rest
with
the
seals
of
the
living
buddha
and
the
ruby
ring
of
jenghiz
khan
ornamented
with
the
sign
of
the
swastika
in
the
chest
in
the
private
study
of
the
bogdo
the
person
of
his
holiness
is
surrounded
by
five
thousand
lamas
they
are
divided
into
many
ranks
from
simple
servants
to
the
councillors
of
god
of
which
latter
the
government
consists
among
these
councillors
are
all
the
four
khans
of
mongolia
and
the
five
highest
princes
of
all
the
lamas
there
are
three
classes
of
peculiar
interest
about
which
the
living
buddha
himself
told
me
when
i
visited
him
with
djam
bolon
the
god
sorrowfully
mourned
over
the
demoralized
and
sumptuous
life
led
by
the
lamas
which
decreased
rapidly
the
number
of
fortune
tellers
and
clairvoyants
among
their
ranks
saying
of
it
if
the
jahantsi
and
narabanchi
monasteries
had
not
preserved
their
strict
regime
and
rules
ta
kure
would
have
been
left
without
prophets
and
fortune
tellers
barun
abaga
nar
and
the
other
holy
lamas
who
had
the
power
of
seeing
that
which
is
hidden
from
the
sight
of
the
common
people
have
gone
with
the
blessing
of
the
this
class
of
lamas
is
a
very
important
one
because
every
important
personage
visiting
the
monasteries
at
urga
is
shown
to
the
lama
tzuren
or
fortune
teller
without
the
knowledge
of
the
visitor
for
the
study
of
his
destiny
and
fate
which
are
then
communicated
to
the
bogdo
hutuktu
so
that
with
these
facts
in
his
possession
the
bogdo
knows
in
what
way
to
treat
his
guest
and
what
policy
to
follow
toward
him
the
tzurens
are
mostly
old
men
skinny
exhausted
and
severe
ascetics
but
i
have
met
some
who
were
young
almost
boys
they
were
the
hubilgan
incarnate
gods
the
future
hutuktus
and
gheghens
of
the
various
mongolian
monasteries
the
second
class
is
the
doctors
or
ta
they
observe
the
actions
of
plants
and
certain
products
from
animals
upon
people
preserve
tibetan
medicines
and
cures
and
study
anatomy
very
carefully
but
without
making
use
of
vivisection
and
the
scalpel
they
are
skilful
bone
setters
masseurs
and
great
connoisseurs
of
hypnotism
and
animal
magnetism
the
third
class
is
the
highest
rank
of
doctors
consisting
chiefly
of
tibetans
and
kalmucks
poisoners
they
may
be
said
to
be
doctors
of
political
they
live
by
themselves
apart
from
any
associates
and
are
the
great
silent
weapon
in
the
hands
of
the
living
buddha
i
was
informed
that
a
large
portion
of
them
are
dumb
i
saw
one
such
doctor
the
very
person
who
poisoned
the
chinese
physician
sent
by
the
chinese
emperor
from
peking
to
liquidate
the
living
buddha
a
small
white
old
fellow
with
a
deeply
wrinkled
face
a
curl
of
white
hairs
on
his
chin
and
with
vivacious
eyes
that
were
ever
shifting
inquiringly
about
him
whenever
he
comes
to
a
monastery
the
local
god
ceases
to
eat
and
drink
in
fear
of
the
activities
of
this
mongolian
locusta
but
even
this
can
not
save
the
condemned
for
a
poisoned
cap
or
shirt
or
boots
or
a
rosary
a
bridle
books
or
religious
articles
soaked
in
a
poisonous
solution
will
surely
accomplish
the
object
of
the
the
deepest
esteem
and
religious
faithfulness
surround
the
blind
pontiff
before
him
all
fall
on
their
faces
khans
and
hutuktus
approach
him
on
their
knees
everything
about
him
is
dark
full
of
oriental
antiquity
the
drunken
blind
man
listening
to
the
banal
arias
of
the
gramophone
or
shaking
his
servants
with
an
electric
current
from
his
dynamo
the
ferocious
old
fellow
poisoning
his
political
enemies
the
lama
keeping
his
people
in
darkness
and
deceiving
them
with
his
prophecies
and
fortune
telling
he
is
however
not
an
entirely
ordinary
man
one
day
we
sat
in
the
room
of
the
bogdo
and
prince
djam
bolon
translated
to
him
my
story
of
the
great
war
the
old
fellow
was
listening
very
carefully
but
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
widely
and
began
to
give
attention
to
some
sounds
coming
in
from
outside
the
room
his
face
became
reverent
supplicant
and
frightened
the
gods
call
me
he
whispered
and
slowly
moved
into
his
private
shrine
where
he
prayed
loudly
about
two
hours
kneeling
immobile
as
a
statue
his
prayer
consists
of
conversation
with
the
invisible
gods
to
whose
questions
he
himself
gave
the
answers
he
came
out
of
the
shrine
pale
and
exhausted
but
pleased
and
happy
it
was
his
personal
prayer
during
the
regular
temple
service
he
did
not
participate
in
the
prayers
for
then
he
is
sitting
on
his
throne
he
is
carried
and
placed
on
the
altar
and
there
prayed
to
by
the
lamas
and
the
people
he
only
receives
the
prayers
hopes
tears
woe
and
desperation
of
the
people
immobilely
gazing
into
space
with
his
sharp
and
bright
but
blind
eyes
at
various
times
in
the
service
the
lamas
robe
him
in
different
vestments
combinations
of
yellow
and
red
and
change
his
caps
the
service
always
finishes
at
the
solemn
moment
when
the
living
buddha
with
the
tiara
on
his
head
pronounces
the
pontifical
blessing
upon
the
congregation
turning
his
face
to
all
four
cardinal
points
of
the
compass
and
finally
stretching
out
his
hands
toward
the
northwest
that
is
to
europe
whither
in
the
belief
of
the
yellow
faith
must
travel
the
teachings
of
the
wise
buddha
after
earnest
prayers
or
long
temple
services
the
pontiff
seems
very
deeply
shaken
and
often
calls
his
secretaries
and
dictates
his
visions
and
prophecies
always
very
complicated
and
unaccompanied
by
his
deductions
sometimes
with
the
words
their
souls
are
communicating
he
puts
on
his
white
robes
and
goes
to
pray
in
his
shrine
then
all
the
gates
of
the
palace
are
shut
and
all
the
lamas
are
sunk
in
solemn
mystic
fear
all
are
praying
telling
their
rosaries
and
whispering
the
orison
om
mani
padme
hung
or
turning
the
prayer
wheels
with
their
prayers
or
exorcisings
the
fortune
tellers
read
their
horoscopes
the
clairvoyants
write
out
their
visions
while
marambas
search
the
ancient
books
for
explanations
of
the
words
of
the
living
buddha
chapter
xli
the
dust
of
centuries
have
you
ever
seen
the
dusty
cobwebs
and
the
mould
in
the
cellars
of
some
ancient
castle
in
italy
france
or
england
this
is
the
dust
of
centuries
perhaps
it
touched
the
faces
helmets
and
swords
of
a
roman
augustus
louis
the
inquisitor
galileo
or
king
richard
your
heart
is
involuntarily
contracted
and
you
feel
a
respect
for
these
witnesses
of
elapsed
ages
this
same
impression
came
to
me
in
ta
kure
perhaps
more
deep
more
realistic
here
life
flows
on
almost
as
it
flowed
eight
centuries
ago
here
man
lives
only
in
the
past
and
the
contemporary
only
complicates
and
prevents
the
normal
life
today
is
a
great
day
the
living
buddha
once
said
to
me
the
day
of
the
victory
of
buddhism
over
all
other
religions
it
was
a
long
time
ago
on
this
day
kublai
khan
called
to
him
the
lamas
of
all
religions
and
ordered
them
to
state
to
him
how
and
what
they
believed
they
praised
their
gods
and
their
hutuktus
discussions
and
quarrels
began
only
one
lama
remained
silent
at
last
he
mockingly
smiled
and
said
great
emperor
order
each
to
prove
the
power
of
his
gods
by
the
performance
of
a
miracle
and
afterwards
judge
and
kublai
khan
so
ordered
all
the
lamas
to
show
him
a
miracle
but
all
were
silent
confused
and
powerless
before
him
now
said
the
emperor
addressing
the
lama
who
had
tendered
this
suggestion
now
you
must
prove
the
power
of
your
gods
the
lama
looked
long
and
silently
at
the
emperor
turned
and
gazed
at
the
whole
assembly
and
then
quietly
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
them
at
this
instant
the
golden
goblet
of
the
emperor
raised
itself
from
the
table
and
tipped
before
the
lips
of
the
khan
without
a
visible
hand
supporting
it
the
emperor
felt
the
delight
of
a
fragrant
wine
all
were
struck
with
astonishment
and
the
emperor
spoke
i
elect
to
pray
to
your
gods
and
to
them
all
people
subject
to
me
must
pray
what
is
your
faith
who
are
you
and
from
where
do
you
come
my
faith
is
the
teaching
of
the
wise
buddha
i
am
pandita
lama
turjo
gamba
from
the
distant
and
glorious
monastery
of
sakkia
in
tibet
where
dwells
incarnate
in
a
human
body
the
spirit
of
buddha
his
wisdom
and
his
power
remember
emperor
that
the
peoples
who
hold
our
faith
shall
possess
all
the
western
universe
and
during
eight
hundred
and
eleven
years
shall
spread
their
faith
throughout
the
whole
thus
it
happened
on
this
same
day
many
centuries
ago
lama
turjo
gamba
did
not
return
to
tibet
but
lived
here
in
ta
kure
where
there
was
then
only
a
small
temple
from
here
he
traveled
to
the
emperor
at
karakorum
and
afterwards
with
him
to
the
capital
of
china
to
fortify
him
in
the
faith
to
predict
the
fate
of
state
affairs
and
to
enlighten
him
according
to
the
will
of
the
living
buddha
was
silent
for
a
time
whispered
a
prayer
and
then
continued
urga
the
ancient
nest
of
buddhism
with
jenghiz
khan
on
his
european
conquest
went
out
the
olets
or
kalmucks
they
remained
there
almost
four
hundred
years
living
on
the
plains
of
russia
then
they
returned
to
mongolia
because
the
yellow
lamas
called
them
to
light
against
the
kings
of
tibet
lamas
of
the
red
caps
who
were
oppressing
the
people
the
kalmucks
helped
the
yellow
faith
but
they
realized
that
lhasa
was
too
distant
from
the
whole
world
and
could
not
spread
our
faith
throughout
the
earth
consequently
the
kalmuck
gushi
khan
brought
up
from
tibet
a
holy
lama
undur
gheghen
who
had
visited
the
king
of
the
from
that
day
the
bogdo
gheghen
has
continuously
lived
in
urga
a
protector
of
the
freedom
of
mongolia
and
of
the
chinese
emperors
of
mongolian
origin
undur
gheghen
was
the
first
living
buddha
in
the
land
of
the
mongols
he
left
to
us
his
successors
the
ring
of
jenghiz
khan
which
was
sent
by
kublai
khan
to
dalai
lama
in
return
for
the
miracle
shown
by
the
lama
turjo
gamba
also
the
top
of
the
skull
of
a
black
mysterious
miracle
worker
from
india
using
which
as
a
bowl
strongtsan
king
of
tibet
drank
during
the
temple
ceremonies
one
thousand
six
hundred
years
ago
as
well
as
an
ancient
stone
statue
of
buddha
brought
from
delhi
by
the
founder
of
the
yellow
faith
the
bogdo
clapped
his
hands
and
one
of
the
secretaries
took
from
a
red
kerchief
a
big
silver
key
with
which
he
unlocked
the
chest
with
the
seals
the
living
buddha
slipped
his
hand
into
the
chest
and
drew
forth
a
small
box
of
carved
ivory
from
which
he
took
out
and
showed
to
me
a
large
gold
ring
set
with
a
magnificent
ruby
carved
with
the
sign
of
the
swastika
this
ring
was
always
worn
on
the
right
hand
of
the
khans
jenghiz
and
kublai
said
the
bogdo
when
the
secretary
had
closed
the
chest
the
bogdo
ordered
him
to
summon
his
favorite
maramba
whom
he
directed
to
read
some
pages
from
an
ancient
book
lying
on
the
table
the
lama
began
to
read
monotonously
when
gushi
khan
the
chief
of
all
the
olets
or
kalmucks
finished
the
war
with
the
red
caps
in
tibet
he
carried
out
with
him
the
miraculous
black
stone
sent
to
the
dalai
lama
by
the
king
of
the
gushi
khan
wanted
to
create
in
western
mongolia
the
capital
of
the
yellow
faith
but
the
olets
at
that
time
were
at
war
with
the
manchu
emperors
for
the
throne
of
china
and
suffered
one
defeat
after
another
the
last
khan
of
the
olets
amursana
ran
away
into
russia
but
before
his
escape
sent
to
urga
the
sacred
black
while
it
remained
in
urga
so
that
the
living
buddha
could
bless
the
people
with
it
disease
and
misfortune
never
touched
the
mongolians
and
their
cattle
about
one
hundred
years
ago
however
some
one
stole
the
sacred
stone
and
since
then
buddhists
have
vainly
sought
it
throughout
the
whole
world
with
its
disappearance
the
mongol
people
began
gradually
to
enough
ordered
bogdo
gheghen
our
neighbors
hold
us
in
contempt
they
forget
that
we
were
their
sovereigns
but
we
preserve
our
holy
traditions
and
we
know
that
the
day
of
triumph
of
the
mongolian
tribes
and
the
yellow
faith
will
come
we
have
the
protectors
of
the
faith
the
buriats
they
are
the
truest
guardians
of
the
bequests
of

spoke
the
living
buddha
and
so
have
spoken
the
ancient
books
chapter
xlii
the
books
of

prince
djam
bolon
asked
a
maramba
to
show
us
the
library
of
the
living
buddha
it
is
a
big
room
occupied
by
scores
of
writers
who
prepare
the
works
dealing
with
the
miracles
of
all
the
living
buddhas
beginning
with
undur

and
ending
with
those
of
the
gheghens
and
hutuktus
of
the
different
mongol
monasteries
these
books
are
afterwards
distributed
through
all
the

and
schools
of

a
maramba
read
two
selections
the
beatific
bogdo
gheghen
breathed
on
a
mirror
immediately
as
through
a
haze
there
appeared
the
picture
of
a
valley
in
which
many
thousands
of
thousands
of
warriors
fought
one
against
another
the
wise
and
living
buddha
burned
incense
in
a
brazier
and
prayed
to
the
gods
to
reveal
the
lot
of
the
princes
in
the
blue
smoke
all
saw
a
dark
prison
and
the
pallid
tortured
bodies
of
the
dead
princes
a
special
book
already
done
into
thousands
of
copies
dwelt
upon
the
miracles
of
the
present
living
buddha
prince
djam
bolon
described
to
me
some
of
the
contents
of
this
volume
there
exists
an
ancient
wooden
buddha
with
open
eyes
he
was
brought
here
from
india
and
bogdo
gheghen
placed
him
on
the
altar
and
began
to
pray
when
he
returned
from
the
shrine
he
ordered
the
statue
of
buddha
brought
out
all
were
struck
with
amazement
for
the
eyes
of
the
god
were
shut
and
tears
were
falling
from
them
from
the
wooden
body
green
sprouts
appeared
and
the
bogdo
said
woe
and
joy
are
awaiting
me
i
shall
become
blind
but
mongolia
will
be
the
prophecy
is
fulfilled
at
another
time
on
a
day
when
the
living
buddha
was
very
much
excited
he
ordered
a
basin
of
water
brought
and
set
before
the
altar
he
called
the
lamas
and
began
to
pray
suddenly
the
altar
candles
and
lamps
lighted
themselves
and
the
water
in
the
basin
became
afterwards
the
prince
described
to
me
how
the
bogdo
khan
tells
fortunes
with
fresh
blood
upon
whose
surface
appear
words
and
pictures
with
the
entrails
of
sheep
and
goats
according
to
whose
distribution
the
bogdo
reads
the
fate
of
the
princes
and
knows
their
thoughts
with
stones
and
bones
from
which
the
living
buddha
with
great
accuracy
reads
the
lot
of
all
men
and
by
the
stars
in
accordance
with
whose
positions
the
bogdo
prepares
amulets
against
bullets
and
disease
the
former
bogdo
khans
told
fortunes
only
by
the
use
of
the
black
stone
said
the
maramba
on
the
surface
of
the
stone
appeared
tibetan
inscriptions
which
the
bogdo
read
and
thus
learned
the
lot
of
whole
when
the
maramba
spoke
of
the
black
stone
with
the
tibetan
legends
appearing
on
it
i
at
once
recalled
that
it
was
possible
in
southeastern
urianhai
in
ulan
taiga
i
came
across
a
place
where
black
slate
was
decomposing
all
the
pieces
of
this
slate
were
covered
with
a
special
white
lichen
which
formed
very
complicated
designs
reminding
me
of
a
venetian
lace
pattern
or
whole
pages
of
mysterious
runes
when
the
slate
was
wet
these
designs
disappeared
and
then
as
they
were
dried
the
patterns
came
out
again
nobody
has
the
right
or
dares
to
ask
the
living
buddha
to
tell
his
fortune
he
predicts
only
when
he
feels
the
inspiration
or
when
a
special
delegate
comes
to
him
bearing
a
request
for
it
from
the
dalai
lama
or
the
tashi
lama
when
the
russian
czar
alexander
i
fell
under
the
influence
of
baroness
kzudener
and
of
her
extreme
mysticism
he
despatched
a
special
envoy
to
the
living
buddha
to
ask
about
his
destiny
the
then
bogdo
khan
quite
a
young
man
told
his
fortune
according
to
the
black
stone
and
predicted
that
the
white
czar
would
finish
his
life
in
very
painful
wanderings
unknown
to
all
and
everywhere
pursued
in
russia
today
there
exists
a
popular
belief
that
alexander
i
spent
the
last
days
of
his
life
as
a
wanderer
throughout
russia
and
siberia
under
the
pseudonym
of
feodor
kusmitch
helping
and
consoling
prisoners
beggars
and
other
suffering
people
often
pursued
and
imprisoned
by
the
police
and
finally
dying
at
tomsk
in
siberia
where
even
until
now
they
have
preserved
the
house
where
he
spent
his
last
days
and
have
kept
his
grave
sacred
a
place
of
pilgrimages
and
miracles
the
former
dynasty
of
romanoff
was
deeply
interested
in
the
biography
of
feodor
kusmitch
and
this
interest
fixed
the
opinion
that
kusmitch
was
really
the
czar
alexander
i
who
had
voluntarily
taken
upon
himself
this
severe
penance
chapter
xliii
the
birth
of
the
living
buddha
the
living
buddha
does
not
die
his
soul
sometimes
passes
into
that
of
a
child
born
on
the
day
of
his
death
and
sometimes
transfers
itself
to
another
being
during
the
life
of
the
buddha
this
new
mortal
dwelling
of
the
sacred
spirit
of
the
buddha
almost
always
appears
in
the
yurta
of
some
poor
tibetan
or
mongol
family
there
is
a
reason
of
policy
for
this
if
the
buddha
appears
in
the
family
of
a
rich
prince
it
could
result
in
the
elevation
of
a
family
that
would
not
yield
obedience
to
the
clergy
and
such
has
happened
in
the
past
while
on
the
other
hand
any
poor
unknown
family
that
becomes
the
heritor
of
the
throne
of
jenghiz
khan
acquires
riches
and
is
readily
submissive
to
the
lamas
only
three
or
four
living
buddhas
were
of
purely
mongolian
origin
the
remainder
were
tibetans
one
of
the
councillors
of
the
living
buddha
jassaktu
told
me
the
following
in
the
monasteries
at
lhasa
and
tashi
lumpo
they
are
kept
constantly
informed
through
letters
from
urga
about
the
health
of
the
living
buddha
when
his
human
body
becomes
old
and
the
spirit
of
buddha
strives
to
extricate
itself
special
solemn
services
begin
in
the
tibetan
temples
together
with
the
telling
of
fortunes
by
astrology
these
rites
indicate
the
specially
pious
lamas
who
must
discover
where
the
spirit
of
the
buddha
will
be
for
this
purpose
they
travel
throughout
the
whole
land
and
observe
often
god
himself
gives
them
signs
and
indications
sometimes
the
white
wolf
appears
near
the
yurta
of
a
poor
shepherd
or
a
lamb
with
two
heads
is
born
or
a
meteor
falls
from
the
sky
some
lamas
take
fish
from
the
sacred
lake
tangri
nor
and
read
on
the
scales
thereof
the
name
of
the
new
bogdo
khan
others
pick
out
stones
whose
cracks
indicate
to
them
where
they
must
search
and
whom
they
must
find
while
others
secrete
themselves
in
narrow
mountain
ravines
to
listen
to
the
voices
of
the
spirits
of
the
mountains
pronouncing
the
name
of
the
new
choice
of
the
gods
when
he
is
found
all
the
possible
information
about
his
family
is
secretly
collected
and
presented
to
the
most
learned
tashi
lama
having
the
name
of
erdeni
the
great
gem
of
learning
who
according
to
the
runes
of
rama
verifies
the
selection
if
he
is
in
agreement
with
it
he
sends
a
secret
letter
to
the
dalai
lama
who
holds
a
special
sacrifice
in
the
temple
of
the
spirit
of
the
mountains
and
confirms
the
election
by
putting
his
great
seal
on
this
letter
of
the
tashi
lama
if
the
old
living
buddha
be
still
alive
the
name
of
his
successor
is
kept
a
deep
secret
if
the
spirit
of
buddha
has
already
gone
out
from
the
body
of
bogdo
khan
a
special
legation
appears
from
tibet
with
the
new
living
buddha
the
same
process
accompanies
the
election
of
the
gheghen
and
hutuktus
in
all
the
lamaite
monasteries
in
mongolia
but
confirmation
of
the
election
resides
with
the
living
buddha
and
is
only
announced
to
lhasa
after
the
chapter
xliv
a
page
in
the
history
of
the
present
living
buddha
the
present
bogdo
khan
of
outer
mongolia
is
a
tibetan
he
sprang
from
a
poor
family
living
in
the
neighborhood
of
sakkia
kure
in
western
tibet
from
earliest
youth
he
had
a
stormy
quite
unaesthetic
nature
he
was
fired
with
the
idea
of
the
independence
and
glorification
of
mongolia
and
the
successors
of
jenghiz
khan
this
gave
him
at
once
a
great
influence
among
the
lamas
princes
and
khans
of
mongolia
and
also
with
the
russian
government
which
always
tried
to
attract
him
to
their
side
he
did
not
fear
to
arraign
himself
against
the
manchu
dynasty
in
china
and
always
had
the

of
russia
tibet

furnishing
him
with
money
weapons

and
diplomatic
aid
the
chinese
emperors
avoided
open
war
with
the
living
god
because
it
might
arouse
the
protests
of
the
chinese
buddhists
at
one
time
they
sent
to
the
bogdo
khan
a
skilful
the
living
buddha
however
at
once
understood
the
meaning
of
this
medical
attention
and
knowing
the
power
of
asiatic
poisons
decided
to
make
a
journey
through
the
mongol
monasteries
and
through
tibet
as
his
substitute
he
left
a
hubilgan
who
made
friends
with
the
chinese
doctor
and
inquired
from
him
the
purposes
and
details
of
his
arrival
very
soon
the
chinese
died
from
some
unknown
cause
and
the
living
buddha
returned
to
his
comfortable
capital
on
another
occasion
danger
threatened
the
living
god
it
was
when
lhasa
decided
that
the
bogdo
khan
was
carrying
out
a
policy
too
independent
of
tibet
the
dalai
lama
began
negotiations
with
several
khans
and
princes
with
the
sain
noion
khan
and
jassaktu
khan
leading
the
movement
and
persuaded
them
to
accelerate
the
immigration
of
the
spirit
of
buddha
into
another
human
form
they
came
to
urga
where
the
bogdo
khan
met
them
with
honors
and
rejoicings
a
great
feast
was
made
for
them
and
the
conspirators
already
felt
themselves
the
accomplishers
of
the
orders
of
the
dalai
lama
however
at
the
end
of
the
feast
they
had
different
feelings
and
died
with
them
during
the
night
the
living
buddha
ordered
their
bodies
sent
with
full
honors
to
their
families
the
bogdo
khan
knows
every
thought
every
movement
of
the
princes
and
khans
the
slightest
conspiracy
against
himself
and
the
offender
is
usually
kindly
invited
to
urga
from
where
he
does
not
return
alive
the
chinese
government
decided
to
terminate
the
line
of
the
living
buddhas
ceasing
to
fight
with
the
pontiff
of
urga
the
government
contrived
the
following
scheme
for
accomplishing
its
ends
peking
invited
the
pandita
gheghen
from
dolo
nor
and
the
head
of
the
chinese
lamaites
the
hutuktu
of
utai
both
of
whom
do
not
recognize
the
supremacy
of
the
living
buddha
to
come
to
the
capital
they
decided
after
consulting
the
old
buddhistic
books
that
the
present
bogdo
khan
was
to
be
the
last
living
buddha
because
that
part
of
the
spirit
of
buddha
which
dwells
in
the
bogdo
khans
can
abide
only
times
in
the
human
body
bogdo
khan
is
the
incarnated
buddha
from
the
time
of
undur
gheghen
and
with
him
therefore
the
dynasty
of
the
urga
pontiffs
must
cease
however
on
hearing
this
the
bogdo
khan
himself
did
some
research
work
and
found
in
the
old
tibetan
manuscripts
that
one
of
the
tibetan
pontiffs
was
married
and
his
son
was
a
natural
incarnated
buddha
so
the
bogdo
khan
married
and
now
has
a
son
a
very
capable
and
energetic
young
man
and
thus
the
religious
throne
of
jenghiz
khan
will
not
be
left
empty
the
dynasty
of
the
chinese
emperors
disappeared
from
the
stage
of
political
events
but
the
living
buddha
continues
to
be
a
center
for
the
idea
the
new
chinese
government
in
held
the
living
buddha
under
arrest
in
his
palace
but
at
the
beginning
of
baron
ungern
crossed
the
sacred
and
approached
the
palace
from
the
rear
tibetan
riders
shot
the
chinese
sentries
with
bow
and
arrow
and
afterwards
the
mongols
penetrated
into
the
palace
and
stole
their
god
who
immediately
stirred
up
all
mongolia
and
awakened
the
hopes
of
the
asiatic
peoples
and
tribes
in
the
great
palace
of
the
bogdo
a
lama
showed
me
a
special
casket
covered
with
a
precious
carpet
wherein
they
keep
the
bulls
of
the
dalai
and
tashi
lamas
the
decrees
of
the
russian
and
chinese
emperors
and
the
treaties
between
mongolia
russia
china
and
tibet
in
this
same
casket
is
the
copper
plate
bearing
the
mysterious
sign
of
the
king
of
the
world
and
the
chronicle
of
the
last
vision
of
the
living
buddha
chapter
xlv
the
vision
of
the
living
buddha
of
may
i
prayed
and
saw
that
which
is
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
the
people
a
vast
plain
was
spread
before
me
surrounded
by
distant
mountains
an
old
lama
carried
a
basket
filled
with
heavy
stones
he
hardly
moved
from
the
north
a
rider
appeared
in
white
robes
and
mounted
on
a
white
horse
he
approached
the
lama
and
said
to
him
give
me
your
basket
i
shall
help
you
to
carry
them
to
the
the
lama
handed
his
heavy
burden
up
to
him
but
the
rider
could
not
raise
it
to
his
saddle
so
that
the
old
lama
had
to
place
it
back
on
his
shoulder
and
continue
on
his
way
bent
under
its
heavy
weight
then
from
the
north
came
another
rider
in
black
robes
and
on
a
black
horse
who
also
approached
the
lama
and
said
stupid
why
do
you
carry
these
stones
when
they
are
everywhere
about
the
ground
with
these
words
he
pushed
the
lama
over
with
the
breast
of
his
horse
and
scattered
the
stones
about
the
ground
when
the
stones
touched
the
earth
they
became
diamonds
all
three
rushed
to
raise
them
but
not
one
of
them
could
break
them
loose
from
the
ground
then
the
old
lama
exclaimed
oh
gods
all
my
life
i
have
carried
this
heavy
burden
and
now
when
there
was
left
so
little
to
go
i
have
lost
it
help
me
great
good
gods
suddenly
a
tottering
old
man
appeared
he
collected
all
the
diamonds
into
the
basket
without
trouble
cleaned
the
dust
from
them
raised
the
burden
to
his
shoulder
and
started
out
speaking
with
the
lama
rest
a
while
i
have
just
carried
my
burden
to
the
goal
and
i
am
glad
to
help
you
with
they
went
on
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
while
the
riders
began
to
fight
they
fought
one
whole
day
and
then
the
whole
night
and
when
the
sun
rose
over
the
plain
neither
was
there
either
alive
or
dead
and
no
trace
of
either
remained
this
i
saw
bogdo

speaking
with
the

and

words
of
the

as
he
came
out

the
subterranean
kingdom
stop
whispered
my
old
mongol
guide
as
we
were
one
day
crossing
the
plain
near
tzagan
luk
stop
he
slipped
from
his
camel
which
lay
down
without
his
bidding
the
mongol
raised
his
hands
in
prayer
before
his
face
and
began
to
repeat
the
sacred
phrase
om
mani
padme
hung
the
other
mongols
immediately
stopped
their
camels
and
began
to
pray
what
has
happened
i
thought
as
i
gazed
round
over
the
tender
green
grass
up
to
the
cloudless
sky
and
out
toward
the
dreamy
soft
rays
of
the
evening
sun
the
mongols
prayed
for
some
time
whispered
among
themselves
and
after
tightening
up
the
packs
on
the
camels
moved
on
did
you
see
asked
the
mongol
how
our
camels
moved
their
ears
in
fear
how
the
herd
of
horses
on
the
plain
stood
fixed
in
attention
and
how
the
herds
of
sheep
and
cattle
lay
crouched
close
to
the
ground
did
you
notice
that
the
birds
did
not
fly
the
marmots
did
not
run
and
the
dogs
did
not
bark
the
air
trembled
softly
and
bore
from
afar
the
music
of
a
song
which
penetrated
to
the
hearts
of
men
animals
and
birds
alike
earth
and
sky
ceased
breathing
the
wind
did
not
blow
and
the
sun
did
not
move
at
such
a
moment
the
wolf
that
is
stealing
up
on
the
sheep
arrests
his
stealthy
crawl
the
frightened
herd
of
antelopes
suddenly
checks
its
wild
course
the
knife
of
the
shepherd
cutting
the
sheep
s
throat
falls
from
his
hand
the
rapacious
ermine
ceases
to
stalk
the
unsuspecting
salga
all
living
beings
in
fear
are
involuntarily
thrown
into
prayer
and
waiting
for
their
fate
so
it
was
just
now
thus
it
has
always
been
whenever
the
king
of
the
world
in
his
subterranean
palace
prays
and
searches
out
the
destiny
of
all
peoples
on
the
in
this
wise
the
old

shepherd
and
hunter

me
mongolia
with
her
nude
and
terrible
mountains
her
limitless
plains
covered
with
the
widely
strewn
bones
of
the
forefathers
gave
birth
to

her
people
frightened
by
the
stormy
passions
of
nature
or
lulled
by
her
deathlike
peace
feel
her

her
red
and
yellow
lamas
preserve
and
poetize
her
mystery
the
pontiffs
of
lhasa
and
urga
know
and
possess
her
mystery
on
my
journey
into
central
asia
i
came
to
know
for
the
first
time
about
the
mystery
of
mysteries
which
i
can
call
by
no
other
name
at
the
outset
i
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
it
and
did
not
attach
to
it
such
importance
as
i
afterwards
realized
belonged
to
it
when
i
had
analyzed
and
connoted
many
sporadic
hazy
and
often
controversial
bits
of
evidence
the
old
people
on
the
shore
of
the
river
amyl
related
to
me
an
ancient
legend
to
the
effect
that
a
certain
mongolian
tribe
in
their
escape
from
the
demands
of
jenghiz
khan
hid
themselves
in
a
subterranean
country
afterwards
a
soyot
from
near
the
lake
of
nogan
kul
showed
me
the
smoking
gate
that
serves
as
the
entrance
to
the
kingdom
of
through
this
gate
a
hunter
formerly
entered
into
the
kingdom
and
after
his
return
began
to
relate
what
he
had
seen
there
the
lamas
cut
out
his
tongue
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
telling
about
the
mystery
of
mysteries
when
he
arrived
at
old
age
he
came
back
to
the
entrance
of
this
cave
and
disappeared
into
the
subterranean
kingdom
the
memory
of
which
had
ornamented
and
lightened
his
nomad
heart
i
received
more
realistic
information
about
this
from
hutuktu
jelyb
djamsrap
in
narabanchi
kure
he
told
me
the
story
of
the
arrival
of
the
powerful
king
of
the
world
from
the
subterranean
kingdom
of
his
appearance
of
his
miracles
and
of
his
prophecies
and
only
then
did
i
begin
to
understand
that
in
that
legend
hypnosis
or
mass
vision
whichever
it
may
be
is
hidden
not
only
mystery
but
a
realistic
and
powerful
force
capable
of
influencing
the
course
of
the
political
life
of
asia
from
that
moment
i
began
making
some
investigations
the
favorite
gelong
lama
of
prince
chultun
beyli
and
the
prince
himself
gave
me
an
account
of
the
subterranean
kingdom
everything
in
the
world
said
the
gelong
is
constantly
in
a
state
of
change
and
transition
peoples
science
religions
laws
and
customs
how
many
great
empires
and
brilliant
cultures
have
perished
and
that
alone
which
remains
unchanged
is
evil
the
tool
of
bad
spirits
more
than
sixty
thousand
years
ago
a
holyman
disappeared
with
a
whole
tribe
of
people
under
the
ground
and
never
appeared
again
on
the
surface
of
the
earth

has
there
developed
calmly
and
nothing
is
threatened
with
destruction
the
subterranean
people
have
reached
the
highest
knowledge
now
it
is
a
large
kingdom
millions
of
men
with
the
king
of
the
world
as
their
ruler
he
knows
all
the
forces
of
the
world
and
reads
all
the
souls
of

and
the
great
book
of
their

invisibly
he
rules
eight
hundred
million
men
on

they
will
accomplish

added
this
kingdom
is
agharti
it
extends
throughout
all
the
subterranean
passages
of
the
whole
world
i
heard
a
learned
lama
of
china
relating
to
bogdo
khan
that
all
the
subterranean
caves
of
america
are
inhabited
by
the
ancient
people
who
have
disappeared
underground
traces
of
them
are
still
found
on
the
surface
of
the
land
these
subterranean
peoples
and
spaces
are
governed
by
rulers
owing
allegiance
to
the
king
of
the
world
in
it
there
is
not
much
of
the
wonderful
you
know
that
in
the
two
greatest
oceans
of
the
east
and
the
west
there
were
formerly
two
continents
they
disappeared
under
the
water
but
their
people
went
into
the
subterranean
kingdom
in
underground
caves
there
exists
a
peculiar
light
which
affords
growth
to
the
grains
and
vegetables
and
long
life
without
disease
to
the
people
there
are
many
different
peoples
and
many
different
tribes
an
old
buddhist
brahman
in
nepal
was
carrying
out
the
will
of
the
gods
in
making
a
visit
to
the
ancient
kingdom
of
jenghiz
siam
where
he
met
a
fisherman
who
ordered
him
to
take
a
place
in
his
boat
and
sail
with
him
upon
the
sea
on
the
third
day
they
reached
an
island
where
he
met
a
people
having
two
tongues
which
could
speak
separately
in
different
languages
they
showed
to
him
peculiar
unfamiliar
animals
tortoises
with
sixteen
feet
and
one
eye
huge
snakes
with
a
very
tasty
flesh
and
birds
with
teeth
which
caught
fish
for
their
masters
in
the
sea
these
people
told
him
that
they
had
come
up
out
of
the
subterranean
kingdom
and
described
to
him
certain
parts
of
the
underground
the
lama
turgut
traveling
with
me
from
urga
to
peking
gave
me
further
details
the
capital
of
agharti
is
surrounded
with
towns
of
high
priests

scientists
it
reminds
one
of

the

can

everything
for

life

death
of

if
our
mad
humankind
should
begin
a
war
against
them
they
would
be
able
to
explode
the
whole
surface
of
our

transform
it
into
deserts

are
the
tales
which
i
heard
in
the
mongolian
yurtas
of

in

were
all
related
in

xlvii
the
king
of
the
world
before
the
face
of
god
during
my
stay
in
urga
i
tried
to
find
an
explanation
of
this
legend
about
the
king
of
the
world
of
course
the
living
buddha
could
tell
me
most
of
all
and
so
i
endeavored
to
get
the
story
from
him
in
a
conversation
with
him
i
mentioned
the
name
of
the
king
of
the
world
the
old
pontiff
sharply
turned
his
head
toward
me
and
fixed
upon
me
his
immobile
blind
eyes
unwillingly
i
became
silent
our
silence
was
a
long
one
and
after
it
the
pontiff
continued
the
conversation
in
such
a
way
that
i
understood
he
did
not
wish
to
accept
the
suggestion
of
my
reference
on
the
faces
of
the
others
present
i
noticed
expressions
of
astonishment
and
fear
produced
by
my
words
and
especially
was
this
true
of
the
custodian
of
the
library
of
the
bogdo
khan
one
can
readily
understand
that
all
this
only
made
me
the
more
anxious
to
press
the
pursuit
as
i
was
leaving
the
study
of
the
bogdo
hutuktu
i
met
the
librarian
who
had
stepped
out
ahead
of
me
and
asked
him
if
he
would
show
me
the
library
of
the
living
buddha
and
used
a
very
simple
sly
trick
with
him
do
you
know
my
dear
lama
i
said
once
i
rode
in
the
plain
at
the
hour
when
the
king
of
the
world
spoke
with
god
and
i
felt
the
impressive
majesty
of
this
to
my
astonishment
the
old
lama
very
quietly
answered
me
it
is
not
right
that
the
buddhist
and
our
yellow
faith
should
conceal
it
the
acknowledgment
of
the
existence
of
the
most
holy
and
most
powerful
man
of
the
blissful
kingdom
of
the
great
temple
of
sacred
science
is
such
a
consolation
to
our
sinful
hearts
and
our
corrupt
lives
that
to
conceal
it
from
humankind
is
a
sin
well
listen
he
continued
throughout
the
whole
year
the
king
of
the
world
guides
the
work
of
the
panditas
and
goros
of
agharti
only
at
times
he
goes
to
the
temple
cave
where
the
embalmed
body
of
his
predecessor
lies
in
a
black
stone
coffin
this
cave
is
always
dark
but
when
the
king
of
the
world
enters
it
the
walls
are
striped
with
fire
and
from
the
lid
of
the
coffin
appear
tongues
of
flame
the
eldest
goro
stands
before
him
with
covered
head
and
face
and
with
hands
folded
across
his
chest
this
goro
never
removes
the
covering
from
his
face
for
his
head
is
a
nude
skull
with
living
eyes
and
a
tongue
that
speaks
he
is
in
communion
with
the
souls
of
all
who
have
gone
before
the
king
of
the
world
prays
for
a
long
time
and
afterwards
approaches
the
coffin
and
stretches
out
his
hand
the
flames
thereon
burn
brighter
the
stripes
of
fire
on
the
walls
disappear
and
revive
interlace
and
form
mysterious
signs
from
the
alphabet
vatannan
from
the
coffin
transparent
bands
of
scarcely
noticeable
light
begin
to
flow
forth
these
are
the
thoughts
of
his
predecessor
soon
the
king
of
the
world
stands
surrounded
by
an
auriole
of
this
light
and
fiery
letters
write
and
write
upon
the
walls
the
wishes
and
orders
of
god
at
this
moment
the
king
of
the
world
is
in
contact
with
the
thoughts
of
all
the
men
who
influence
the
lot
and
life
of
all
humankind
with
kings
czars
khans
warlike
leaders
high
priests
scientists
and
other
strong
men
he
realizes
all
their
thoughts
and
plans
if
these
be
pleasing
before
god
the
king
of
the
world
will
invisibly
help
them
if
they
are
unpleasant
in
the
sight
of
god
the
king
will
bring
them
to
destruction
this
power
is
given
to
agharti
by
the
mysterious
science
of

with
which
we
begin
all
our
prayers

the
name
of
an
ancient

years
ago
he
was
the
first
man
to
know
god
and
who
taught
humankind
to
believe

and
struggle
with
evil
then
god
gave
him

over

has
anybody
seen
the
king
of

i
asked
oh
yes
answered
the
lama
during
the
solemn
holidays
of
the
ancient
buddhism
in
siam
and
india
the
king
of
the
world
appeared
five
times
he
rode
in
a
splendid
car
drawn
by
white
elephants
and
ornamented
with
gold
precious
stones
and
finest
fabrics
he
was
robed
in
a
white
mantle
and
red
tiara
with
strings
of
diamonds
masking
his
face
he
blessed
the
people
with
a
golden
apple
with
the
figure
of
a

above
it
the

received

the

freely

and
the
dead
arose
wherever
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
the
world
rested
he
also
appeared
five
hundred
and
forty
years
ago
in
erdeni
dzu
he
was
in
the
ancient
sakkai
monastery
and
in
the
narabanchi
kure
one
of
our
living
buddhas
and
one
of
the
tashi
lamas
received
a
message
from
him
written
with
unknown
signs
on
golden
tablets
no
one
could
read
these
signs
the
tashi
lama
entered
the
temple
placed
the
golden
tablet
on
his
head
and
began
to
pray
with
this
the
thoughts
of
the
king
of
the
world
penetrated
his
brain
and
without
having
read
the
enigmatical
signs
he
understood
and
accomplished
the
message
of
the
how
many
persons
have
ever
been
to
agharti
i
questioned
him
very
many
answered
the
lama
but
all
these
people
have
kept
secret
that
which
they
saw
there
when
the
olets
destroyed
lhasa
one
of
their
detachments
in
the
southwestern
mountains
penetrated
to
the
outskirts
of
agharti
here
they
learned
some
of
the
lesser
mysterious
sciences
and
brought
them
to
the
surface
of
our
earth
this
is
why
the
olets
and
kalmucks
are
artful
sorcerers
and
prophets
also
from
the
eastern
country
some
tribes
of
black
people
penetrated
to
agharti
and
lived
there
many
centuries
afterwards
they
were
thrust
out
from
the
kingdom
and
returned
to
the
earth
bringing
with
them
the
mystery
of
predictions
according
to
cards
grasses
and
the
lines
of
the
palm
they
are
the
gypsies
somewhere
in
the
north
of
asia
a
tribe
exists
which
is
now
dying
and
which
came
from
the
cave
of
agharti
skilled
in
calling
back
the
spirits
of
the
dead
as
they
float
through
the
the
lama
was
silent
and
afterwards
as
though
answering
my
thoughts
continued
in
agharti
the
learned
panditas
write
on
tablets
of
stone
all
the
science
of
our
planet
and
of
the
other
worlds
the
chinese
learned
buddhists
know
this
their
science
is
the
highest
and
purest
every
century
one
hundred
sages
of
china
collect
in
a
secret
place
on
the
shores
of
the
sea
where
from
its
depths
come
out
one
hundred
tortoises
on
their
shells
the
chinese
write
all
the
developments
of
the
divine
science
of
the
as
i
write
i
am
involuntarily
reminded
of
a
tale
of
an
old
chinese
bonze
in
the
temple
of
heaven
at
peking
he
told
me
that
tortoises
live
more
than
three
thousand
years
without
food
and
air
and
that
this
is
the
reason
why
all
the
columns
of
the
blue
temple
of
heaven
were
set
on
live
tortoises
to
preserve
the
wood
from
decay
several
times
the
pontiffs
of
lhasa

they
could
not
find
him

then
the

will
come
up
from
their
subterranean
caverns
to
the
surface
of
the
afterwards
as
i
traveled
farther
through
eastern
mongolia
and
to
peking
i
often
thought
and
what
if
what
if
whole
peoples
of
different
colors
faiths
and
tribes
should
begin
their
migration
toward
the
west
and
now
as
i
write
these
final
lines
my
eyes
involuntarily
turn
to
this
limitless
heart
of
asia
over
which
the
trails
of
my
wanderings
twine
through
whirling
snow
and
driving
clouds
of
sand
of
the

they
travel
back
to
the
face
of
the
narabanchi
hutuktu
as
with
quiet
voice
and
a
slender
hand
pointing
to
the
horizon
he
opened
to
me
the
doors
of
his
innermost
thoughts
near
karakorum
and
on
the
shores
of
ubsa
nor
i
see
the
huge
camps
the
herds
of
horses
and
cattle
and
the

of

princes
the
sacred

the
coats
of

of
the

of

and
the
simple
signs
of
the
north
mongolian
tribes
i
do
not
hear
the
noise
of
the
animated
crowd
the
singers
do
not
sing
the
mournful
songs
of
mountain
plain
and

the
young
riders
are
not
delighting
themselves
with
the
races
on
their

there
are
