regained
what
katy
did
at
school
chapter
conic
section
it
was
just
after
that
happy
visit
of
which
i
told
at
the
end
of
what
katy
did
that
elsie
and
john
made
their
famous
excursion
to
conic
section
an
excursion
which
neither
of
them
ever
forgot
and
about
which
the
family
teased
them
for
a
long
time
afterward
the
summer
had
been
cool
but
as
often
happens
after
cool
summers
the
autumn
proved
unusually
hot
it
seemed
as
if
the
months
had
been
playing
a
game
and
had
changed
places
all
round
and
as
if
september
were
determined
to
show
that
he
knew
how
to
make
himself
just
as
disagreeable
as
august
if
only
he
chose
to
do
so
all
the
last
half
of
cousin
helen
stay
the
weather
was
excessively
sultry
she
felt
it
very
much
though
the
children
did
all
they
could
to
make
her
comfortable
with
shaded
rooms
and
iced
water
and
fans
every
evening
the
boys
would
wheel
her
sofa
out
on
the
porch
in
hopes
of
coolness
but
it
was
of
no
use
the
evenings
were
as
warm
as
the
days
and
the
yellow
dust
hanging
in
the
air
made
the
sunshine
look
thick
and
hot
a
few
bright
leaves
appeared
on
the
trees
but
they
were
wrinkled
and
of
an
ugly
color
clover
said
she
thought
they
had
been
red
like
lobsters
altogether
the
month
was
a
trying
one
and
the
coming
of
october
made
little
difference
still
the
dust
continued
and
the
heat
and
the
wind
when
it
blew
had
no
refreshment
in
it
but
seemed
to
have
passed
over
some
great
furnace
which
had
burned
out
of
it
all
life
and
flavor
in
spite
of
this
however
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
katy
gained
and
improved
every
day
added
to
her
powers
first
she
came
down
to
dinner
then
to
breakfast
she
sat
on
the
porch
in
the
afternoons
she
poured
the
tea
it
was
like
a
miracle
to
the
others
in
the
beginning
to
watch
her
going
about
the
house
but
they
got
used
to
it
surprisingly
soon
one
does
to
pleasant
things
one
person
however
never
got
used
to
it
never
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
and
that
was
katy
herself
she
could
not
run
downstairs
or
out
into
the
garden
she
could
not
open
the
kitchen
door
to
give
an
order
without
a
sense
of
gladness
and
exultation
which
was
beyond
words
the
wider
and
more
active
life
stimulated
her
in
every
way
her
cheeks
grew
round
and
pink
her
eyes
bright
cousin
helen
and
papa
watched
this
change
with
indescribable
pleasure
and
worrett
who
dropped
in
to
lunch
one
day
fairly
screamed
with
surprise
at
the
sight
of
it
to
think
of
it
she
cried
why
the
last
time
i
was
here
you
looked
as
if
you
had
took
root
in
that
chair
of
yours
for
the
rest
of
your
days
and
here
you
are
stepping
around
as
lively
as
i
be
well
well
wonders
will
never
cease
it
does
my
eyes
good
to
see
you
katherine
i
wish
your
poor
aunt
were
here
that
i
do
how
pleased
be
it
is
doubtful
whether
aunt
izzie
would
have
been
so
pleased
for
the
look
of
the
best
parlor
would
have
horrified
her
extremely
but
katy
did
not
recollect
that
just
then
she
was
touched
at
the
genuine
kindness
of
worrett
voice
and
took
very
willingly
her
offered
kiss
clover
brought
lemonade
and
grapes
and
they
all
devoted
themselves
to
making
the
poor
lady
comfortable
just
before
she
went
away
she
said
how
is
it
that
i
ca
never
get
any
of
you
to
come
out
to
the
conic
section
i
sure
i
asked
you
often
enough
there
elsie
now
and
john
they
just
the
age
to
enjoy
being
in
the
country
why
wo
you
send
out
for
a
week
johnnie
can
feed
chickens
and
chase
too
if
she
likes
she
added
as
johnnie
dashed
just
then
into
view
pursuing
one
of
phil
bantams
round
the
house
tell
her
so
wo
you
katherine
there
is
lots
of
chickens
on
the
farm
she
can
chase
from
morning
to
night
if
she
a
mind
to
katy
thanked
her
but
she
did
think
the
children
would
care
to
go
she
gave
johnnie
the
message
and
then
the
whole
matter
passed
out
of
her
mind
the
family
were
in
low
spirits
that
morning
because
of
cousin
helen
having
just
gone
away
and
elsie
was
lying
on
the
sofa
fanning
herself
with
a
great
fan
oh
dear
she
sighed
do
you
suppose
it
every
going
to
be
cool
again
it
does
seem
as
if
i
could
bear
it
any
longer
are
you
well
darling
inquired
katy
anxiously
oh
yes
well
enough
replied
elsie
it
only
this
horrid
heat
and
never
going
away
to
where
it
cooler
i
keep
thinking
about
the
country
and
wishing
i
were
there
feeling
the
wind
blow
i
wonder
if
papa
would
let
john
and
me
go
to
conic
section
and
see
worrett
do
you
think
he
would
if
you
asked
him
but
said
katy
amazed
conic
section
is
exactly
country
you
know
it
is
just
out
of
the
city
only
six
miles
from
here
and
worrett
house
is
close
to
the
road
papa
said
do
you
think
you
like
it
dear
it
be
very
much
cooler
than
this
oh
yes
it
can
rejoined
elsie
in
a
tone
which
was
a
little
fretful
it
cooler
on
a
farm
there
more
room
for
the
wind
and
oh
every
thing
pleasanter
you
ca
think
how
tired
i
am
of
this
hot
house
last
night
i
hardly
slept
at
all
and
when
i
did
i
dreamed
that
i
was
a
loaf
of
brown
bread
and
debby
was
putting
me
into
the
oven
to
bake
it
was
a
horrid
dream
i
was
so
glad
to
wake
up
wo
you
ask
papa
if
we
may
go
katy
why
of
course
i
will
if
you
wish
it
so
much
only
katy
stopped
and
did
not
finish
her
sentence
a
vision
of
fat
worrett
had
risen
before
her
and
she
could
not
help
doubting
if
elsie
would
find
the
farm
as
pleasant
as
she
expected
but
sometimes
the
truest
kindness
is
in
giving
people
their
own
unwise
way
and
elsie
eyes
looked
so
wistful
that
katy
had
no
heart
to
argue
or
refuse
carr
looked
doubtful
when
the
plan
was
proposed
to
him
it
too
hot
he
said
i
do
believe
the
girls
will
like
it
oh
yes
we
will
papa
indeed
we
will
pleaded
elsie
and
john
who
had
lingered
near
the
door
to
learn
the
fate
of
their
request
carr
smiled
at
the
imploring
faces
but
he
looked
a
little
quizzical
very
well
he
said
you
may
go
worrett
is
coming
into
town
on
some
bank
business
i
send
word
by
him
and
in
the
afternoon
when
it
is
cooler
alexander
can
drive
you
out
goody
goody
cried
john
jumping
up
and
down
while
elsie
put
her
arms
round
papa
neck
and
gave
him
a
hug
and
thursday
i
send
for
you
he
continued
but
papa
expostulated
elsie
that
only
two
days
worrett
said
a
week
yes
she
said
a
week
chimed
in
john
and
she
got
ever
so
many
chickens
and
i
to
feed
and
chase
as
much
as
i
like
only
it
too
hot
to
run
much
she
added
reflectively
you
wo
really
send
for
us
on
thursday
will
you
papa
urged
elsie
anxiously
i
like
to
stay
ever
and
ever
so
long
but
worrett
said
a
week
i
shall
send
on
thursday
repeated
carr
in
a
decided
tone
then
seeing
that
elsie
lip
was
trembling
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
he
continued
do
look
so
woeful
pussy
alexander
shall
drive
out
for
you
but
if
you
want
to
stay
longer
you
may
send
him
back
with
a
note
to
say
what
day
you
would
like
to
have
him
come
again
will
that
do
oh
yes
said
elsie
wiping
her
eyes
that
will
do
beautifully
papa
only
it
seems
such
a
pity
that
alexander
should
have
to
go
twice
when
it
so
hot
for
we
perfectly
sure
to
want
to
stay
a
week
papa
only
laughed
as
he
kissed
her
all
being
settled
the
children
began
to
get
ready
it
was
quite
an
excitement
packing
the
bags
and
deciding
what
to
take
and
what
not
to
take
elsie
grew
bright
and
gay
with
the
bustle
just
to
think
of
being
in
the
country
the
cool
green
country
made
her
perfectly
happy
she
declared
the
truth
was
she
was
a
little
feverish
and
not
quite
well
and
did
know
exactly
how
she
felt
or
what
she
wanted
the
drive
out
was
pleasant
except
that
alexander
upset
john
gravity
and
hurt
elsie
dignity
very
much
by
inquiring
as
they
left
the
gate
do
the
little
misses
know
where
it
is
that
they
want
to
go
part
of
the
way
the
road
ran
through
woods
they
were
rather
boggy
woods
but
the
dense
shade
kept
off
the
sun
and
there
was
a
spicy
smell
of
evergreens
and
sweet
fern
elsie
felt
that
the
good
time
had
fairly
begun
and
her
spirits
rose
with
every
turn
of
the
wheels
by
and
by
they
left
the
woods
and
came
out
again
into
the
sunshine
the
road
was
dusty
and
so
were
the
fields
and
the
ragged
sheaves
of
which
dotted
them
here
and
there
looked
dusty
too
piles
of
dusty
red
apples
lay
on
the
grass
under
the
orchard
trees
some
cows
going
down
a
lane
toward
their
milking
shed
mooed
in
a
dispirited
and
thirsty
way
which
made
the
children
feel
thirsty
also
i
want
a
drink
of
water
awfully
said
john
do
you
suppose
much
farther
how
long
will
it
be
before
we
get
to
worrett
alexander
there
miss
replied
alexander
laconically
elsie
put
her
head
out
of
the
carriage
and
looked
eagerly
round
where
was
the
delightful
farm
she
saw
a
big
house
by
the
roadside
a
little
farther
on
but
surely
that
could
be
it
yes
alexander
drew
up
at
the
gate
and
jumped
down
to
lift
them
out
it
really
was
the
surprise
quite
took
away
her
breath
she
looked
about
there
were
the
woods
to
be
sure
but
half
a
mile
away
across
the
fields
near
the
house
there
were
no
trees
at
all
only
some
lilac
bushes
at
one
side
there
was
no
green
grass
either
a
gravel
path
took
up
the
whole
of
the
narrow
front
yard
and
what
with
the
blazing
color
of
the
paint
and
the
look
of
the
blindless
windows
the
house
had
somehow
the
air
of
standing
on
and
staring
hard
at
something
the
dust
in
the
road
perhaps
for
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
stare
at
elsie
heart
sank
indescribably
as
she
and
john
got
very
slowly
out
of
the
carryall
and
alexander
putting
his
arm
over
the
fence
rapped
loudly
at
the
front
door
it
was
some
minutes
before
the
rap
was
answered
then
a
heavy
step
was
heard
creaking
through
the
hall
and
somebody
began
fumbling
at
an
obstinate
bolt
which
would
not
move
next
a
voice
which
they
recognized
as
worrett
called
isaphiny
isaphiny
come
and
see
if
you
can
open
this
door
how
funny
whispered
johnnie
beginning
to
giggle
isaphiny
seemed
to
be
upstairs
for
presently
they
heard
her
running
down
after
which
a
fresh
rattle
began
at
the
obstinate
bolt
but
still
the
door
did
not
open
and
at
length
worrett
put
her
lips
to
the
keyhole
and
asked
who
is
it
the
voice
sounded
so
hollow
and
ghostly
that
elsie
jumped
as
she
answered
it
i
worrett
elsie
carr
and
johnnie
here
too
ts
ts
ts
sounded
from
within
and
then
came
a
whispering
after
which
worrett
put
her
mouth
again
to
the
keyhole
and
called
out
go
round
to
the
back
children
i
ca
make
this
door
open
anyway
it
swelled
up
with
the
damp
damp
whispered
johnnie
why
it
has
rained
since
the
third
week
in
august
papa
said
so
yesterday
that
nothing
miss
johnnie
put
in
alexander
overhearing
her
folks
hereaway
do
open
their
front
doors
much
only
for
weddings
and
funerals
and
such
like
very
likely
this
has
stood
shut
these
five
years
i
know
the
last
time
i
drove
miss
carr
out
before
she
died
it
was
just
so
and
she
had
to
go
round
to
the
back
as
now
john
eyes
grew
wide
with
wonder
but
there
was
no
time
to
say
any
thing
for
they
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
and
there
was
worrett
waiting
at
the
kitchen
door
to
receive
them
she
looked
fatter
than
ever
elsie
thought
but
she
kissed
them
both
and
said
she
was
real
glad
to
see
a
carr
in
her
house
at
last
it
was
too
bad
she
went
on
to
keep
you
waiting
so
but
the
fact
is
i
got
asleep
and
when
you
knocked
i
waked
up
all
in
a
daze
and
for
a
minute
it
did
come
to
me
who
it
must
be
take
the
bags
right
upstairs
isaphiny
and
put
them
in
the
chamber
your
pa
elsie
and
katy
not
laid
up
again
i
hope
oh
no
she
seems
to
get
better
all
the
time
that
right
responded
worrett
heartily
i
did
know
but
what
with
hot
weather
and
company
in
the
house
and
all
there
a
chicken
johnnie
she
exclaimed
suddenly
interrupting
herself
as
a
hen
ran
past
the
door
want
to
chase
it
right
away
you
can
if
you
like
or
would
you
rather
go
upstairs
first
upstairs
please
replied
john
while
elsie
went
to
the
door
and
watched
alexander
driving
away
down
the
dusty
road
she
felt
as
if
their
last
friend
had
deserted
them
then
she
and
johnnie
followed
isaphiny
upstairs
worrett
never
mounted
in
hot
weather
she
told
them
the
spare
chamber
was
just
under
the
roof
it
was
very
hot
and
smelt
as
if
the
windows
had
never
been
opened
since
the
house
was
built
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
elsie
ran
across
the
room
and
threw
up
the
sash
but
the
moment
she
let
go
it
fell
again
with
a
crash
which
shook
the
floor
and
made
the
pitcher
dance
and
rattle
in
the
the
children
were
dreadfully
frightened
especially
when
they
heard
worrett
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
calling
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
it
only
the
window
explained
elsie
going
into
the
hall
i
so
sorry
but
it
wo
stay
open
something
the
matter
with
it
did
you
stick
the
nail
in
inquired
worrett
the
nail
no
why
how
on
earth
did
you
expect
it
do
stay
up
then
you
young
folks
never
see
what
before
your
eyes
look
on
the
and
find
it
it
put
there
a
purpose
elsie
returned
much
discomfited
she
looked
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
big
nail
and
there
was
a
hole
in
the
side
of
the
in
which
to
stick
it
this
time
she
got
the
window
open
without
accident
but
a
long
blue
paper
shade
caused
her
much
embarrassment
it
hung
down
and
kept
the
air
from
coming
in
she
saw
no
way
of
fastening
it
roll
it
up
and
put
in
a
pin
suggested
john
i
afraid
of
tearing
the
paper
dear
what
a
horrid
thing
it
is
replied
elsie
in
a
disgusted
tone
however
she
stuck
in
a
couple
of
pins
and
fastened
the
shade
out
of
the
way
after
that
they
looked
about
the
room
it
was
plainly
furnished
but
very
nice
and
neat
the
bureau
was
covered
with
a
white
towel
on
which
stood
a
pincushion
with
remember
ruth
stuck
upon
it
in
pins
john
admired
this
very
much
and
felt
that
she
could
never
make
up
her
mind
to
spoil
the
pattern
by
taking
out
a
pin
however
great
her
need
of
one
might
be
what
a
high
bed
she
exclaimed
elsie
you
have
to
climb
on
a
chair
to
get
into
it
and
so
shall
i
elsie
felt
of
it
feathers
she
cried
a
tone
of
horror
o
john
why
did
we
come
what
shall
we
do
i
guess
we
sha
mind
it
much
replied
john
who
was
perfectly
well
and
considered
these
little
variations
on
home
habits
rather
as
fun
than
otherwise
but
elsie
gave
a
groan
two
nights
on
a
how
should
she
bear
it
tea
was
ready
in
the
kitchen
when
they
went
downstairs
a
small
fire
had
been
lighted
to
boil
the
water
it
was
almost
out
but
the
room
felt
stiflingly
warm
and
the
butter
was
so
nearly
melted
that
worrett
had
to
help
it
with
a
buzzing
flies
hovered
above
the
table
and
gathered
thick
on
the
plate
of
cake
the
bread
was
excellent
and
so
were
the
cottage
cheeses
and
the
stewed
quinces
but
elsie
could
eat
nothing
she
was
in
a
fever
of
heat
worrett
was
distressed
at
this
want
of
appetite
and
so
was
worrett
to
whom
the
children
had
just
been
introduced
he
was
a
old
man
with
a
bald
head
who
came
to
supper
in
his
and
was
a
thin
as
his
wife
was
fat
i
afraid
the
little
girl
do
like
her
supper
lucinda
he
said
you
must
see
about
getting
her
something
different
for
oh
it
is
that
every
thing
is
very
nice
only
i
not
hungry
pleaded
elsie
feeling
as
if
she
should
like
to
cry
she
did
cry
a
little
after
tea
as
they
sat
in
the
dusk
worrett
smoking
his
pipe
and
slapping
mosquitoes
outside
the
door
and
worrett
sleeping
rather
noisily
in
a
big
but
not
even
johnnie
found
out
that
she
was
crying
for
elsie
felt
that
she
was
the
naughtiest
child
in
the
world
to
behave
so
badly
when
everybody
was
so
kind
to
her
she
repeated
this
to
herself
many
times
but
it
did
do
much
good
as
often
as
the
thought
of
home
and
katy
and
papa
came
a
wild
longing
to
get
back
to
them
would
rush
over
her
and
her
eyes
would
fill
again
with
sudden
tears
the
night
was
very
uncomfortable
not
a
breath
of
wind
was
stirring
or
none
found
its
way
to
the
stifling
bed
where
the
little
sisters
lay
john
slept
pretty
well
in
spite
of
heat
and
mosquitoes
but
elsie
hardly
closed
her
eyes
once
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
but
the
blue
paper
shade
had
become
unfastened
and
rattled
down
upon
her
head
with
a
sudden
bump
which
startled
her
very
much
she
could
find
no
pins
in
the
dark
so
she
left
it
hanging
whereupon
it
rustled
and
flapped
through
the
rest
of
the
night
and
did
its
share
toward
keeping
her
awake
about
three
she
fell
into
a
doze
and
it
seemed
only
a
minute
after
that
before
she
waked
up
to
find
bright
sunshine
in
the
room
and
half
a
dozen
roosters
crowing
and
calling
under
the
windows
her
head
ached
violently
she
longed
to
stay
in
bed
but
was
afraid
it
would
be
thought
impolite
so
she
dressed
and
went
down
with
johnnie
but
she
looked
so
pale
and
ate
so
little
breakfast
that
worrett
was
quite
troubled
and
said
she
had
better
not
try
to
go
out
but
just
lie
on
the
lounge
in
the
best
room
and
amuse
herself
with
a
book
the
lounge
in
the
best
room
was
covered
with
slippery
purple
chintz
it
was
a
high
lounge
and
very
narrow
there
was
nothing
at
the
end
to
hold
the
pillow
in
its
place
so
the
pillow
constantly
tumbled
off
and
jerked
elsie
head
suddenly
backward
which
was
not
at
all
comfortable
worse
elsie
having
dropped
into
a
doze
she
herself
tumbled
to
the
floor
rolling
from
the
glassy
smooth
chintz
as
if
it
had
been
a
slope
of
ice
this
adventure
made
her
so
nervous
that
she
dared
not
go
to
sleep
again
though
johnnie
fetched
two
chairs
and
placed
them
beside
the
sofa
to
hold
her
on
so
she
followed
worretts
advice
and
amused
herself
with
a
book
there
were
not
many
books
in
the
best
room
the
one
elsie
chose
was
a
fat
black
volume
called
the
complete
works
of
hannah
more
part
of
it
was
prose
and
part
was
poetry
elsie
began
with
a
chapter
called
hints
on
the
formation
of
the
character
of
a
youthful
princess
but
there
were
a
great
many
long
words
in
it
so
she
turned
to
a
story
named
coelebs
in
search
of
a
wife
it
was
about
a
young
gentleman
who
wanted
to
get
married
but
who
did
feel
sure
that
there
were
any
young
ladies
nice
enough
for
him
so
he
went
about
making
visits
first
to
one
and
then
to
another
and
when
he
had
stayed
a
few
days
at
a
house
he
would
always
say
no
she
do
and
then
he
would
go
away
at
last
he
found
a
young
lady
who
seemed
the
very
person
who
visited
the
poor
and
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
always
wore
white
and
never
forgot
to
wind
up
her
watch
or
do
her
duty
and
elsie
almost
thought
that
now
the
difficult
young
gentleman
must
be
satisfied
and
say
this
is
the
very
thing
when
lo
her
attention
wandered
a
little
and
the
next
thing
she
knew
she
was
rolling
off
the
lounge
for
the
second
time
in
company
with
hannah
more
they
landed
in
the
chairs
and
johnnie
ran
and
picked
them
both
up
altogether
lying
on
the
best
parlor
sofa
was
not
very
restful
and
as
the
day
went
on
and
the
sun
beating
on
the
blindless
windows
made
the
room
hotter
elsie
grew
continually
more
and
more
feverish
and
homesick
and
disconsolate
meanwhile
johnnie
was
kept
in
occupation
by
worrett
who
had
got
the
idea
firmly
fixed
in
her
mind
that
the
chief
joy
of
a
life
was
to
chase
chickens
whenever
a
hen
fluttered
past
the
kitchen
door
which
was
about
once
in
three
minutes
she
would
cry
here
johnnie
here
another
chicken
for
you
to
chase
and
poor
johnnie
would
feel
obliged
to
dash
out
into
the
sun
being
a
very
polite
little
girl
she
did
not
like
to
say
to
worrett
that
running
in
the
heat
was
disagreeable
so
by
she
was
thoroughly
tired
out
and
would
have
been
cross
if
she
had
known
how
but
she
did
johnnie
was
never
cross
after
dinner
it
was
even
worse
for
the
sun
was
hotter
and
the
chickens
who
did
mind
sun
seemed
to
be
walking
all
the
time
hurry
johnnie
here
another
came
so
constantly
that
at
last
elsie
grew
desperate
got
up
and
went
to
the
kitchen
with
a
languid
appeal
please
worrett
wo
you
let
johnnie
stay
by
me
because
my
head
aches
so
hard
after
that
johnnie
had
a
rest
for
worrett
was
the
kindest
of
women
and
had
no
idea
that
she
was
not
amusing
her
little
guest
in
the
most
delightful
manner
a
little
before
six
elsie
head
felt
better
and
she
and
johnnie
put
on
their
hats
and
went
for
a
walk
in
the
garden
there
was
not
much
to
see
beds
of
vegetables
a
few
currant
bushes
that
was
all
elsie
was
leaning
against
a
paling
and
trying
to
make
out
why
the
worrett
house
had
that
queer
tiptoe
expression
when
a
sudden
loud
grunt
startled
her
and
something
touched
the
top
of
her
head
she
turned
and
there
was
an
enormous
pig
standing
on
his
hind
legs
on
the
other
side
of
the
paling
he
was
taller
than
elsie
as
he
stood
thus
and
it
was
his
cold
nose
which
had
touched
her
head
somehow
appearing
in
this
unexpected
way
he
seemed
to
the
children
like
some
dreadful
wild
beast
they
screamed
with
fright
and
fled
to
the
house
from
which
elsie
never
ventured
to
stir
again
during
their
visit
john
chased
chickens
at
intervals
but
it
was
a
doubtful
pleasure
and
all
the
time
she
kept
a
wary
eye
on
the
distant
pig
that
evening
while
worrett
slept
and
worrett
smoked
outside
the
door
elsie
felt
so
very
miserable
that
she
broke
down
altogether
she
put
her
head
in
johnnie
lap
as
they
sat
together
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
and
sobbed
and
cried
making
as
little
noise
as
she
possibly
could
johnnie
comforted
her
with
soft
pats
and
strokings
but
did
not
dare
to
say
a
word
for
fear
worrett
should
wake
up
and
find
them
out
when
the
morning
came
elsie
one
thought
was
would
alexander
come
for
them
in
the
afternoon
all
day
she
watched
the
clock
and
the
road
with
feverish
anxiety
oh
if
papa
had
changed
his
mind
had
decided
to
let
them
stay
for
a
week
at
conic
section
what
should
she
do
it
was
just
possible
to
worry
through
and
keep
alive
till
afternoon
she
thought
but
if
they
were
forced
to
spend
another
night
in
that
with
those
mosquitoes
hearing
the
blue
shad
rattle
and
quiver
hour
after
hour
she
should
die
she
was
sure
she
should
die
but
elsie
was
not
called
upon
to
die
or
even
to
discover
how
easy
it
is
to
survive
a
little
discomfort
about
five
her
anxious
watch
was
rewarded
by
the
appearance
of
a
cloud
of
dust
out
of
which
presently
emerged
old
whitey
ears
and
the
top
of
the
carryall
they
stopped
at
the
gate
there
was
alexander
brisk
and
smiling
very
glad
to
see
his
little
misses
again
and
to
find
them
so
glad
to
go
home
worrett
however
did
not
discover
that
they
were
glad
no
indeed
elsie
and
john
were
much
too
polite
for
that
they
thanked
the
old
lady
and
said
so
prettily
that
after
they
were
gone
she
told
worrett
that
it
had
been
a
bit
of
trouble
having
them
there
and
she
hoped
they
would
come
again
they
enjoyed
every
thing
so
much
only
it
was
a
pity
that
elsie
looked
so
peaked
and
at
that
very
moment
elsie
was
sitting
on
the
floor
of
the
carryall
with
her
head
in
john
lap
crying
and
sobbing
for
joy
that
the
visit
was
over
and
that
she
was
on
the
way
home
if
only
i
live
to
get
there
she
said
i
never
no
never
go
into
the
country
again
which
was
silly
enough
but
we
must
forgive
her
because
she
was
half
sick
ah
how
charming
home
did
look
with
the
family
grouped
in
the
shady
porch
katy
in
her
white
wrapper
clover
with
in
her
belt
and
everybody
ready
to
welcome
and
pet
the
little
absentees
there
was
much
hugging
and
kissing
and
much
to
tell
of
what
had
happened
in
the
two
days
how
a
letter
had
come
from
cousin
helen
how
daisy
white
had
four
kittens
as
white
as
herself
how
dorry
had
finished
his
a
wheel
which
turned
in
the
and
was
really
ingenious
papa
said
and
phil
had
swapped
one
of
his
bantam
chicks
for
on
of
eugene
slack
bramapootras
it
was
not
till
they
were
all
seated
round
the
that
anybody
demanded
an
account
of
the
visit
elsie
felt
this
a
relief
and
was
just
thinking
how
delicious
every
thing
was
from
the
sliced
peaches
to
the
clinking
ice
in
the
when
papa
put
the
dreaded
question
well
elsie
so
you
decided
to
come
after
all
how
was
it
why
did
you
stay
your
week
out
you
look
pale
it
seems
to
me
have
you
been
enjoying
yourself
too
much
tell
us
all
about
it
elsie
looked
at
papa
and
papa
looked
at
elsie
carr
eyes
twinkled
just
a
little
but
otherwise
he
was
perfectly
grave
elsie
began
to
speak
then
to
laugh
then
to
cry
and
the
explanation
when
it
came
was
given
in
a
mingled
burst
of
all
three
o
papa
it
was
horrid
that
is
worrett
was
just
as
kind
as
could
be
but
so
fat
and
oh
such
a
pig
i
never
imagined
such
a
pig
and
the
calico
on
that
horrid
sofa
was
so
slippery
that
i
rolled
off
five
times
and
once
i
hurt
myself
real
badly
and
we
had
a
and
i
was
so
homesick
that
i
cried
all
the
evening
that
must
have
been
gratifying
to
worrett
put
in
carr
oh
she
did
know
it
papa
she
was
asleep
and
snoring
so
that
nobody
could
hear
and
the
flies
such
flies
katy
and
the
mosquitoes
and
our
window
would
open
till
i
put
in
a
nail
i
am
so
glad
to
get
home
i
never
want
to
go
into
the
country
again
never
never
oh
if
alexander
had
come
why
clover
what
are
you
laughing
for
and
dorry
i
think
it
very
unkind
and
elsie
ran
to
katy
hid
her
face
and
began
to
cry
never
mind
darling
they
did
mean
to
be
unkind
papa
her
hands
are
quite
hot
you
must
give
her
something
katy
voice
shook
a
little
but
she
would
not
hurt
elsie
feeling
by
showing
that
she
was
amused
papa
gave
elsie
something
before
she
went
to
bed
a
very
mild
dose
i
fancy
for
doctors
little
girls
as
a
general
rule
do
not
take
medicine
and
next
day
she
was
much
better
as
the
adventures
of
the
conic
section
visit
leaked
out
bit
by
bit
the
family
laughed
till
it
seemed
as
if
they
would
never
stop
phil
was
forever
enacting
the
pig
standing
on
his
triumphant
hind
legs
and
patting
elsie
head
with
his
nose
and
many
and
many
a
time
it
will
end
like
your
visit
to
worrett
proved
a
useful
check
when
elsie
was
in
a
mood
and
bent
on
some
scheme
which
for
the
moment
struck
her
as
delightful
for
one
of
the
good
things
about
our
childish
mistakes
is
that
each
one
teaches
us
something
and
so
blundering
on
we
grow
wiser
till
when
the
time
comes
we
are
ready
to
take
our
places
among
the
wonderful
people
who
never
make
mistakes
chapter
ii
a
new
year
and
a
new
plan
when
summer
lingers
on
into
october
it
often
seems
as
if
winter
anxious
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
hurries
a
little
and
so
people
are
cheated
out
of
their
autumn
it
was
so
that
year
almost
as
soon
as
it
ceased
to
be
hot
it
began
to
be
cold
the
leaves
instead
of
drifting
away
in
soft
dying
colors
like
sunset
clouds
turned
yellow
all
at
once
and
were
whirled
off
the
trees
in
a
single
gusty
night
leaving
every
thing
bare
and
desolate
thanksgiving
came
and
before
the
smell
of
the
turkey
was
fairly
out
of
the
house
it
was
time
to
hang
up
stockings
and
dress
the
christmas
tree
they
had
a
tree
that
year
in
honor
of
katy
being
downstairs
cecy
who
had
gone
away
to
came
home
and
it
was
all
delightful
except
that
the
days
flew
too
fast
clover
said
it
seemed
to
her
very
queer
that
there
was
so
much
less
time
than
usual
in
the
world
she
could
imagine
what
had
become
of
it
there
used
to
be
plenty
and
she
was
certain
that
dorry
must
have
been
tinkering
all
the
clocks
they
struck
so
often
it
was
just
after
new
year
that
carr
walked
in
one
day
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
and
remarked
and

mr

business
and
they
will
stop
for
a
few
days
with
us
your
cousin
olivia
writes
that
she
is
anxious
to
see
all
you
children
have
every
thing
as
nice
as
you
can
katy
of
course
i
will
what
day
are
the
coming
thursday
no
friday
replied
carr
consulting
the
letter
friday
evening
at
six
order
something
substantial
for
tea
that
night
katy
they
be
hungry
after
traveling
katy
worked
with
a
will
for
the
next
two
days
twenty
times
at
least
she
went
into
the
blue
room
to
make
sure
that
nothing
was
forgotten
repeating
as
if
it
had
been
a
lesson
in
geography
bath
towels
face
towels
matches
soap
candles
cologne
extra
blanket
ink
a
nice
little
fire
was
lighted
in
the
bedroom
on
friday
afternoon
and
a
big
beautiful
one
in
the
parlor
which
looked
very
pleasant
with
the
lamp
lit
and
clover
geraniums
and
china
roses
in
the
window
the
table
was
set
with
the
best
linen
and
the
china
debby
muffins
were
very
light
the
jelly
came
out
of
its
mould
clear
and
whole
and
the
cold
chicken
looked
appetizing
with
its
green
wreath
of
parsley
there
was
stewed
potato
too
and
of
course
oysters
everybody
in
burnet
had
oysters
for
tea
when
company
was
expected
they
were
counted
a
special
treat
because
they
were
rather
dear
and
could
not
always
be
procured
burnet
was
a
thousand
miles
from
the
sea
so
the
oysters
were
of
the
can
variety
the
cans
gave
the
oysters
a
curious
taste
tinny
or
was
it
more
like
solder
at
all
events
burnet
people
liked
it
and
always
insisted
that
it
was
a
striking
improvement
on
the
flavor
which
oysters
have
on
their
native
shores
every
thing
was
as
nice
as
could
be
when
katy
stood
in
the
to
take
a
last
look
at
her
arrangements
and
she
hoped
papa
would
be
pleased
and
that
mamma
cousin
would
think
her
a
good
housekeeper
i
do
want
to
have
on
my
other
jacket
observed
phil
putting
his
head
in
at
the
door
need
i
this
is
nice
let
me
see
said
katy
gently
turning
him
round
well
it
does
pretty
well
but
i
think
i
rather
you
should
put
on
the
other
if
you
do
mind
much
we
want
every
thing
as
nice
as
possible
you
know
because
this
is
papa
company
and
he
hardly
ever
has
any
just
one
little
sticky
place
is
much
said
phil
rather
gloomily
wetting
his
finger
a
rubbing
at
a
shiny
place
on
his
sleeve
do
you
really
thing
i
better
well
then
i
will
that
a
dear
kissing
him
be
quick
philly
for
it
almost
time
they
were
here
and
please
tell
dorry
to
make
haste
ever
so
long
since
he
went
upstairs
dorry
an
awful
prink
remarked
phil
confidentially
he
looks
in
the
glass
and
makes
faces
if
he
ca
get
his
parting
straight
i
would
care
so
much
about
my
clothes
for
a
good
deal
it
like
a
girl
jim
slack
says
a
boy
who
shines
his
hair
up
like
that
never
get
to
be
president
not
if
he
lives
a
thousand
years
well
said
katy
laughing
it
something
to
be
clean
even
if
you
ca
be
president
she
was
not
at
all
alarmed
by
dorry
recent
reaction
in
favor
of
personal
adornment
he
came
down
pretty
soon
very
spick
and
span
in
his
best
suit
and
asked
her
to
fasten
the
blue
ribbon
under
his
collar
which
she
did
most
obligingly
though
he
was
very
particular
as
to
the
size
of
the
bows
and
length
of
the
ends
and
made
her
tie
and
retie
more
than
once
she
had
just
arranged
it
to
suit
him
when
a
carriage
stopped
there
they
are
she
cried
run
and
open
the
door
dorry
dorry
did
so
and
katy
following
found
papa
ushering
in
a
tall
gentleman
and
a
lady
who
was
not
tall
but
whose
roman
nose
and
long
neck
and
general
air
of
style
and
fashion
made
her
look
so
katy
bent
quite
over
to
be
kissed
but
for
all
that
she
felt
small
and
young
and
unformed
as
the
eyes
of
mamma
cousin
looked
her
over
and
over
and
through
and
through
and
mrs
page
said
why
philip
is
it
possible
that
this
tall
girl
is
one
of
yours
dear
me
how
time
flies
i
was
thinking
of
the
little
creatures
i
saw
when
i
was
here
last
and
this
other
great
creature
ca
be
elsie
that
mite
of
a
baby
impossible
i
can
not
realize
it
i
really
can
not
realize
it
in
the
least
wo
you
come
to
the
fire
mrs
page
said
katy
rather
timidly
do
call
me
mrs
page
my
dear
call
me
cousin
olivia
then
the
rustled
into
the
parlor
where
johnnie
and
phil
were
waiting
to
be
introduced
and
again
she
remarked
that
she
could
realize
it
i
do
know
why
mrs
page
not
realizing
it
should
have
made
katy
uncomfortable
but
it
did
supper
went
off
well
the
guests
ate
and
praised
and
carr
looked
pleased
and
said
we
think
katy
an
excellent
housekeeper
for
her
age
at
which
katy
blushed
and
was
delighted
till
she
caught
mrs
eyes
fixed
upon
her
with
a
look
of
scrutiny
and
amusement
whereupon
she
felt
awkward
and
ill
at
ease
it
was
so
all
the
evening
cousin
was
entertaining
and
bright
and
told
lively
stories
but
the
children
felt
that
she
was
watching
them
and
passing
judgment
on
their
ways
children
are
very
quick
to
suspect
when
older
people
hold
within
themselves
these
little
private
courts
of
inquiry
and
they
always
resent
it
next
morning
mrs
page
sat
by
while
katy
washed
the
breakfast
things
fed
the
birds
and
did
various
odd
jobs
about
the
room
and
house
my
dear
she
said
at
last
what
a
solemn
girl
you
are
i
should
think
from
your
face
that
you
were
at
least
five
and
thirty
do
you
ever
laugh
or
frolic
like
other
girls
your
age
why
my
lilly
who
is
four
months
older
than
you
is
a
perfect
child
still
impulsive
as
a
baby
bubbling
over
with
fun
from
morning
till
night
i
been
shut
up
a
good
deal
said
katy
trying
to
defend
herself
but
i
did
know
i
was
solemn
my
dear
that
the
very
thing
i
complain
of
you
do
know
it
you
are
altogether
ahead
of
your
age
it
very
bad
for
you
in
my
opinion
all
this
housekeeping
and
care
for
young
girls
like
you
and
clover
is
wrong
and
unnatural
i
do
like
it
indeed
i
do
oh
housekeeping
does
hurt
me
a
bit
protested
katy
trying
to
smile
we
have
lovely
times
indeed
we
do
cousin
olivia
cousin
olivia
only
pursed
up
her
mouth
and
repeated
it
wrong
my
dear
it
unnatural
it
not
the
thing
for
you
depend
upon
it
it
not
the
thing
this
was
unpleasant
but
what
was
worse
had
katy
known
it
mrs
page
attacked
carr
upon
the
subject
he
was
quite
troubled
to
learn
that
she
considered
katy
grave
and
careworn
and
unlike
what
girls
of
her
age
should
be
katy
caught
him
looking
at
her
with
a
puzzled
expression
what
is
it
dear
papa
do
you
want
anything
no
child
nothing
what
are
you
doing
there
mending
the
parlor
curtain
eh
ca
old
mary
attend
to
that
and
give
you
a
chance
to
frisk
about
with
the
other
girls
papa
as
if
i
wanted
to
frisk
i
declare
you
as
bad
as
cousin
olivia
she
always
telling
me
that
i
ought
to
bubble
over
with
mirth
i
do
wish
to
bubble
i
do
know
how
i
afraid
you
do
said
carr
with
an
odd
sigh
which
set
katy
to
wondering
what
should
papa
sigh
for
had
she
done
any
thing
wrong
she
began
to
rack
her
brains
and
memory
as
to
whether
it
could
be
this
or
that
or
if
not
what
could
it
be
such
needless
does
no
good
katy
looked
more
solemn
than
ever
after
it
altogether
mrs
page
was
not
a
favorite
in
the
family
she
had
every
intention
of
being
kind
to
her
cousin
children
so
dreadfully
in
want
of
a
mother
poor
things
but
she
could
not
hide
the
fact
that
their
ways
puzzled
and
did
not
please
her
and
the
children
detected
this
as
children
always
will
she
and
mr
page
were
very
polite
they
praised
the
housekeeping
and
the
excellent
order
or
every
thing
and
said
there
never
were
better
children
in
the
world
than
john
and
dorry
and
phil
but
through
all
katy
perceived
the
hidden
disapproval
and
she
could
help
feeling
glad
when
the
visit
ended
and
they
went
away
with
their
departure
matters
went
back
to
their
old
train
and
katy
forgot
her
disagreeable
feelings
papa
seemed
a
little
grave
and
preoccupied
but
the
doctors
often
are
when
they
have
bad
cases
to
think
of
and
nobody
noticed
it
particularly
or
remarked
that
several
letters
came
from
mrs
page
and
nothing
was
heard
of
their
contents
except
that
cousin
olivia
sent
her
love
so
it
was
a
shock
when
one
day
papa
called
katy
into
the
study
to
tell
of
a
new
plan
she
knew
at
once
that
it
was
something
important
when
she
heard
his
voice
it
sounded
so
grave
beside
he
said
my
daughter
he
began
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
something
which
i
have
been
thinking
of
how
would
you
and
clover
like
going
away
to
school
together
to
school
to
mrs
knight
no
not
to
knight
to
a
at
the
east
where
lilly
page
has
been
for
two
years
did
you
hear
cousin
olivia
speak
of
it
when
she
was
here
i
believe
i
did
but
papa
you
wo
really
yes
i
think
so
said
carr
gently
listen
katy
and
feel
so
badly
my
dear
child
i
thought
the
plan
over
carefully
and
it
seems
to
me
a
good
one
though
i
hate
to
part
from
you
it
is
pretty
much
as
your
cousin
says
these
which
i
take
from
you
while
you
are
at
home
are
making
you
old
before
your
time
heaven
knows
i
do
want
to
turn
you
into
a
silly
giggling
miss
but
i
should
like
you
to
enjoy
your
youth
while
you
have
it
and
not
grow
before
you
are
twenty
what
is
the
name
of
the
school
asked
katy
her
voice
sound
a
good
deal
like
a
sob
the
girls
call
it
nunnery
it
is
at
hillsover
on
the
connecticut
river
pretty
cold
i
fancy
but
the
air
is
sure
to
be
good
and
bracing
that
is
one
thing
which
has
inclined
me
to
the
plan
the
climate
is
just
what
you
need
hillsover
is
there
a
college
there
too
yes
arrowmouth
college
i
believe
there
is
always
a
college
where
there
is
a
though
why
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
that
neither
here
nor
there
however
i
not
afraid
of
your
getting
into
silly
scrapes
as
girls
sometimes
do
college
scrapes
why
how
could
i
we
do
have
any
thing
to
do
with
the
college
do
we
said
katy
opening
her
candid
eyes
with
such
a
wondering
stare
that
carr
laughed
and
replied
no
my
dear
not
a
thing
the
term
opens
the
third
week
in
april
he
went
on
you
must
begin
to
get
ready
at
once
hall
has
just
fitted
out
cecy
so
she
can
tell
you
what
you
will
need
you
better
consult
her
but
papa
cried
katy
beginning
to
realize
it
what
are
going
to
do
elsie
a
darling
but
she
so
very
little
i
see
how
you
can
possibly
manage
i
sure
you
miss
us
and
so
will
the
children
i
rather
think
we
shall
said
carr
with
a
smile
which
ended
in
a
sigh
but
we
shall
do
very
well
katy
never
fear
miss
finch
will
see
to
us
miss
finch
do
you
mean
knight
yes
her
mother
died
in
the
summer
so
she
has
no
particular
home
now
and
is
glad
to
come
for
a
year
and
keep
house
for
us
knight
says
she
is
a
good
manager
and
i
dare
say
she
fill
your
place
sufficiently
well
as
far
as
that
goes
we
ca
expect
her
to
be
you
know
that
would
be
unreasonable
and
carr
put
his
arm
round
katy
and
kissed
her
so
fondly
that
she
was
quite
overcome
and
clung
to
him
crying
o
papa
do
make
us
go
i
frisk
and
be
as
young
as
i
can
and
not
grow
or
any
thing
disagreeable
if
only
you
let
us
stay
never
mind
what
cousin
olivia
says
she
does
know
cousin
helen
would
say
so
i
sure
on
the
contrary
helen
thinks
well
of
the
plan
only
she
wishes
the
school
were
nearer
said
carr
no
katy
do
coax
my
mind
is
made
up
it
will
do
you
and
clover
both
good
and
once
you
are
settled
at
hillsover
you
be
very
happy
i
hope
when
papa
spoke
in
this
decided
tone
it
was
never
any
use
to
urge
him
katy
knew
this
and
ceased
her
pleadings
she
went
to
find
clover
and
tell
her
the
news
and
the
two
girls
had
a
hearty
cry
together
a
sort
of
shower
it
turned
out
to
be
for
when
once
they
had
wiped
their
eyes
every
thing
looked
brighter
and
they
began
to
see
a
pleasant
side
to
the
plan
the
travelling
part
of
it
will
be
very
nice
pronounced
clover
we
never
went
so
far
away
from
home
before
elsie
who
was
still
looking
very
woeful
burst
into
tears
afresh
at
this
remark
oh
do
darling
said
katy
think
how
pleasant
it
will
be
to
send
letters
and
to
get
them
from
us
i
shall
write
to
you
every
saturday
run
for
the
big
atlas
there
a
dear
and
let
us
see
where
we
are
going
elsie
brought
the
atlas
and
the
three
heads
bent
eagerly
over
it
as
clover
traced
the
route
of
the
journey
with
her
forefinger
how
exciting
it
looked
there
was
the
railroad
twisting
and
curving
over
states
the
black
dots
which
followed
it
were
towns
and
villages
all
of
which
they
should
see
by
and
by
the
road
made
a
bend
and
swept
northward
by
the
side
of
the
connecticut
river
and
toward
the
hills
they
had
heard
how
beautiful
the
connecticut
valley
is
only
think
we
shall
be
close
to
it
remarked
clover
and
we
shall
see
the
hills
i
suppose
they
are
very
high
a
great
deal
higher
than
the
hill
at
bolton
i
hope
so
laughed
carr
who
came
into
the
room
just
then
the
hill
at
bolton
was
one
of
his
favorite
jokes
when
mamma
first
came
to
burnet
she
had
paid
a
visit
to
some
friends
at
bolton
and
one
day
when
they
were
all
out
walking
they
asked
her
if
she
felt
strong
enough
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
hill
mamma
was
used
to
hills
so
she
said
yes
and
walked
on
very
glad
to
find
that
there
was
a
hill
in
that
flat
country
but
wondering
a
little
why
they
did
not
see
it
at
last
she
asked
where
it
was
and
behold
they
had
just
reached
the
top
the
slope
had
been
so
gradual
that
she
had
never
found
out
that
they
were
going
uphill
at
all
carr
had
told
this
story
to
the
children
but
had
never
been
able
to
make
them
see
the
joke
very
clearly
in
fact
when
clover
went
to
bolton
she
was
quite
struck
with
the
hill
it
was
so
much
higher
than
the
which
bordered
the
lake
at
burnet
there
was
a
great
deal
to
do
to
make
the
girls
ready
for
school
by
the
third
week
in
april
hall
was
very
kind
and
her
advice
was
sensible
though
except
for
carr
the
girls
would
hardly
have
had
furs
and
flannels
enough
for
so
cold
a
place
as
hillsover
every
thing
for
winter
as
well
as
for
summer
had
to
be
thought
of
for
it
had
been
arranged
that
the
girls
should
not
come
home
for
the
autumn
vacation
but
should
spend
it
with
mrs
page
this
was
the
hardest
thing
about
the
plan
katy
begged
very
hard
for
christmas
but
when
she
learned
that
it
would
take
three
days
to
come
and
three
days
to
go
and
that
the
holidays
lasted
less
than
a
week
she
saw
it
was
of
no
use
and
gave
up
the
idea
while
elsie
tried
to
comfort
herself
by
planning
a
the
preparations
kept
them
so
busy
that
there
was
no
time
for
any
thing
else
hall
was
always
wanting
them
to
go
with
her
to
shops
or
miss
petingill
demanding
that
they
should
try
on
linings
and
so
the
days
flew
by
at
last
all
was
ready
the
nice
of
pretty
underclothes
came
home
from
the
woman
and
were
done
up
by
bridget
who
dropped
many
a
tear
into
the
bluing
water
at
the
thought
of
the
young
ladies
going
away
hall
who
was
a
good
packer
put
the
things
into
the
new
trunks
everybody
gave
the
girls
presents
as
if
they
had
been
brides
starting
on
a
wedding
journey
papa
was
a
watch
for
each
they
were
not
new
but
the
girls
thought
them
beautiful
katy
had
belonged
to
her
mother
it
was
large
and
with
a
finely
wrought
case
clover
which
had
been
her
grandmother
was
larger
still
it
had
a
quaint
ornament
on
the
back
a
sort
of
knot
done
in
gold
of
different
tints
the
girls
were
excessively
pleased
with
these
watches
they
wore
them
with
of
black
watered
ribbon
and
every
other
minute
they
looked
to
see
what
the
time
was
elsie
had
been
in
papa
confidence
so
her
presents
were
watch
cases
embroidered
on
perforated
paper
johnnie
gave
katy
a
case
of
pencils
and
clover
a
with
a
pearl
handle
dorry
and
phil
clubbed
to
buy
a
box
of
and
envelopes
which
the
girls
were
requested
to
divide
between
them
miss
petingill
contributed
a
bottle
of
ginger
balsam
and
a
box
of
opodeldoc
salve
to
be
used
in
case
of
possible
chilblains
old
mary
offering
was
a
couple
of
full
of
bright
sharp
needles
i
would
give
you
scissors
she
said
but
you
ca
cut
love
or
for
the
matter
of
that
any
thing
else
with
a
needle
miss
finch
the
new
housekeeper
arrived
a
few
days
before
they
started
so
katy
had
time
to
take
her
over
the
house
and
explain
all
the
different
things
she
wanted
done
and
not
done
to
secure
comfort
and
the
children
miss
finch
was
meek
and
gentle
she
seemed
glad
of
a
comfortable
home
and
katy
felt
that
she
would
be
kind
to
the
boys
and
not
fret
debby
and
drive
her
into
marrying
alexander
and
going
away
an
event
which
aunt
izzie
had
been
used
to
predict
now
that
all
was
settled
she
and
clover
found
themselves
looking
forward
to
the
change
with
pleasure
there
was
something
new
and
interesting
about
it
which
excited
their
imaginations
the
last
evening
was
a
melancholy
one
elsie
had
been
too
much
absorbed
in
the
preparations
to
realize
her
loss
but
when
it
came
to
locking
the
trunks
her
courage
gave
way
altogether
she
was
in
such
a
state
of
affliction
that
everybody
else
became
afflicted
too
and
there
is
no
knowing
what
would
have
happened
had
not
a
parcel
arrived
by
express
and
distracted
their
attention
the
parcel
was
from
cousin
helen
whose
things
like
herself
had
a
knack
of
coming
at
the
moment
when
most
wanted
it
contained
two
pretty
silk
umbrellas
one
brown
and
one
with
katy
initials
on
one
handle
and
clover
on
the
other
opening
these
treasures
and
exclaiming
over
them
helped
the
family
through
the
evening
wonderfully
and
next
morning
there
was
such
a
bustle
of
getting
off
that
nobody
had
time
to
cry
after
the
last
kisses
had
been
given
and
philly
who
had
climbed
on
the
was
clamoring
for
one
more
just
one
more
carr
looking
at
the
sober
faces
was
struck
by
a
bright
idea
and
calling
alexander
told
him
to
hurry
old
whitey
into
the
carryall
and
drive
the
children
down
to
willett
point
that
they
might
wave
there
handkerchiefs
to
the
boat
as
she
went
by
this
suggestion
worked
like
a
charm
on
the
spirits
of
the
party
phil
began
to
caper
and
elsie
and
john
ran
in
to
get
their
hats
half
an
hour
later
when
the
boat
rounded
the
point
there
stood
the
little
crew
radiant
with
smiles
fluttering
the
handkerchiefs
and
kissing
their
hands
as
cheerfully
as
possible
it
was
a
pleasant
last
look
to
the
two
who
stood
beside
papa
on
the
deck
and
as
they
waved
back
their
greetings
to
the
little
ones
and
then
looked
forward
across
the
blue
water
to
the
unknown
places
they
were
going
to
see
katy
and
clover
felt
that
the
new
life
opened
well
and
promised
to
be
very
interesting
indeed
chapter
iii
on
the
way
the
journey
from
burnet
to
hillsover
was
a
very
long
one
it
took
the
greater
part
of
three
days
and
as
carr
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
his
patients
they
travelled
without
stopping
spending
the
first
night
on
the
boat
and
the
second
on
a
railroad
train
papa
found
this
tiresome
but
the
girls
to
whom
every
thing
was
new
thought
it
delightful
they
enjoyed
their
with
its
narrow
shelves
of
beds
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
a
baby
house
and
they
two
children
playing
in
it
to
tuck
themselves
away
for
the
night
in
a
seemed
the
greatest
fun
in
the
world
when
older
people
fretted
they
laughed
every
thing
was
interesting
from
the
telegraph
poles
by
the
wayside
to
the
faces
of
their
it
amused
them
to
watch
people
and
make
up
stories
about
them
where
they
were
going
and
what
relation
they
could
be
to
each
other
the
strange
people
in
their
turn
cast
curious
glances
toward
the
bright
sisters
but
katy
and
clover
did
not
mind
that
or
in
fact
notice
it
they
were
too
much
absorbed
to
think
of
themselves
or
the
impression
they
were
making
on
others
it
was
early
on
the
third
morning
that
the
train
puffing
and
shrieking
ran
into
the
springfield
depot
other
trains
stood
waiting
and
there
was
such
a
chorus
of
snorts
and
whistles
and
such
clouds
of
smoke
that
katy
was
half
frightened
papa
who
was
half
asleep
jumped
up
and
told
the
girls
to
collect
their
bags
and
books
for
they
were
to
breakfast
here
and
to
meet
lilly
page
who
was
going
on
to
hillsover
with
them
do
you
suppose
she
is
here
already
asked
katy
tucking
the
railway
guide
into
the
and
closing
her
bag
with
a
snap
yes
we
shall
meet
her
at
the
massasoit
she
and
her
father
were
to
pass
the
night
there
the
massasoit
was
close
at
hand
and
in
less
then
five
minutes
the
girls
and
papa
were
seated
at
a
table
in
its
pleasant
they
were
ordering
their
breakfast
when
mr
page
came
in
accompanied
by
his
daughter
a
pretty
girl
with
light
hair
delicate
rather
sharp
features
and
her
mother
stylish
ease
of
manner
her
travelling
dress
was
simple
but
had
the
finish
which
a
french
dressmaker
knows
how
to
give
to
a
simple
thing
and
all
its
appointments
boots
hat
gloves
collar
neck
ribbon
were
so
perfect
each
in
its
way
that
clover
glancing
down
at
her
own
gray
alpaca
and
then
at
katy
felt
suddenly
countrified
and
shabby
well
lilly
here
they
are
here
are
your
cousins
said
mr
page
giving
the
girls
a
cordial
greeting
lilly
only
said
how
do
you
do
clover
saw
her
glancing
at
the
gray
alpacas
and
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
flush
but
perhaps
lilly
looked
at
something
inside
the
alpaca
for
after
a
minute
her
manner
changed
and
became
more
friendly
did
you
order
waffles
she
asked
waffles
no
i
think
not
replied
katy
oh
why
not
do
you
know
how
celebrated
they
are
for
waffles
at
this
hotel
i
thought
everybody
knew
then
she
tinkled
her
fork
against
her
glass
and
when
the
waiter
came
said
waffles
please
with
an
air
which
impressed
clover
extremely
lilly
seemed
to
her
like
a
young
lady
in
a
story
so
elegant
and
she
wondered
if
all
the
girls
at
hillsover
were
going
to
be
like
her
the
waffles
came
crisp
and
hot
with
delicious
maple
syrup
to
eat
on
them
and
the
party
made
a
satisfactory
breakfast
lilly
in
spite
of
all
her
elegance
displayed
a
wonderful
appetite
you
see
she
explained
to
clover
i
do
expect
to
have
another
decent
thing
to
eat
till
next
september
not
a
thing
so
i
making
the
most
of
this
accordingly
she
disposed
of
nine
waffles
in
quick
succession
before
she
found
time
to
utter
any
thing
farther
except
butter
please
or
may
i
trouble
you
for
the
molasses
as
she
swallowed
the
last
morsel
carr
looking
at
his
watch
said
that
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
train
and
they
set
off
as
they
crossed
the
street
katy
was
surprised
to
see
that
lilly
who
had
seemed
quite
happy
only
a
minute
before
had
begun
to
cry
after
they
reached
the
car
her
tears
increased
to
sobs
she
grew
almost
hysterical
oh
do
make
me
go
papa
she
implored
clinging
to
her
arm
i
shall
be
so
homesick
it
will
kill
me
i
know
it
will
please
let
me
stay
please
let
me
go
home
with
you
now
my
darling
protested
mr
page
this
is
foolish
you
know
it
is
i
ca
help
it
blubbered
lilly
i
ca
help
it
oh
make
me
go
do
papa
dear
i
ca
bear
it
katy
and
clover
felt
embarrassed
during
this
scene
they
had
always
been
used
to
considering
tears
as
things
to
be
rather
ashamed
of
to
be
kept
back
if
possible
or
if
not
shed
in
private
corners
in
dark
closets
or
behind
the
bed
in
the
nursery
to
see
the
stylish
lilly
crying
like
a
baby
in
the
midst
of
a
railway
carriage
with
strangers
looking
on
quite
shocked
them
it
did
not
last
long
however
the
whistle
sounded
the
conductor
shouted
all
aboard
and
mr
page
giving
lilly
a
last
kiss
disengaged
her
clinging
arms
put
her
into
the
seat
beside
clover
and
hurried
out
of
the
car
lilly
sobbed
loudly
for
a
few
seconds
then
she
dried
her
eyes
lifted
her
head
adjusted
her
veil
and
the
wrists
of
her
buttoned
gloves
and
remarked
i
always
go
on
in
this
way
ma
says
i
am
a
real
and
i
suppose
i
am
i
do
see
how
people
can
be
calm
and
composed
when
they
leaving
home
do
you
you
be
just
as
bad
when
you
come
to
say
to
your
papa
oh
i
hope
not
said
katy
because
papa
would
feel
so
badly
lilly
stared
i
shall
think
you
real
if
you
do
she
said
in
an
offended
tone
katy
took
no
notice
of
the
tone
and
before
long
lilly
recovered
from
her
pettishness
and
began
to
talk
about
the
school
katy
and
clover
asked
eager
questions
they
were
eager
to
hear
all
that
lily
could
tell
you
adore
florence
she
said
all
the
girls
do
she
the
most
fascinating
woman
she
does
just
what
she
likes
with
everybody
why
even
the
students
think
her
perfectly
splendid
and
yet
just
as
strict
as
she
can
be
strict
with
the
students
asked
clover
looking
puzzled
no
strict
with
us
girls
she
never
lets
any
one
call
unless
a
brother
or
a
first
cousin
and
then
you
have
to
have
a
letter
from
you
parents
asking
permission
i
wanted
ma
to
write
and
say
that
george
hickman
might
call
on
me
he
is
a
first
cousin
exactly
but
his
father
married
pa
sister
so
it
just
as
good
but
ma
was
real
mean
about
it
she
says
i
too
young
to
have
gentlemen
coming
to
see
me
i
ca
think
why
ever
so
many
girls
have
them
who
are
younger
than
i
which
row
are
you
going
to
room
in
she
went
on
i
do
know
nobody
told
us
that
there
were
any
rows
oh
yes
shaker
row
and
quaker
row
and
attic
row
attic
row
is
the
nicest
because
it
highest
up
and
furthest
away
from
florence
my
room
is
in
attic
row
annie
silsbie
and
i
engaged
it
last
term
you
be
in
quaker
row
i
guess
most
of
the
new
girls
are
is
that
a
nice
row
asked
clover
greatly
interested
pretty
nice
it
is
so
good
as
attic
but
it
ever
so
much
better
than
shaker
because
there
you
close
to
florence
and
have
a
bit
of
fun
without
her
hearing
you
i
try
to
get
the
end
room
if
i
were
you
mary
andrews
and
i
had
it
once
there
is
a
splendid
view
of
berry
searles
window
berry
searles
yes
president
searles
you
know
his
youngest
son
he
an
elegant
fellow
all
the
girls
are
cracked
about
him
perfectly
cracked
the
president
house
is
next
door
to
the
nunnery
you
know
and
berry
rooms
at
the
very
end
of
the
back
building
just
opposite
quaker
row
it
used
to
be
such
fun
he
sit
at
his
window
and
we
sit
at
ours
in
silent
study
hour
you
know
and
he
pretend
to
read
and
all
the
time
keep
looking
over
the
top
of
his
book
at
us
and
trying
to
make
us
laugh
once
mary
did
laugh
right
out
and
miss
jane
heard
her
and
came
in
but
berry
is
just
as
quick
as
a
flash
and
he
ducked
down
under
the
so
she
did
see
him
it
was
such
fun
who
miss
jane
asked
katy
the
horridest
old
thing
she
florence
niece
and
engaged
to
a
missionary
florence
keeps
her
on
purpose
to
spy
us
girls
and
report
when
we
break
the
rules
oh
those
rules
just
wait
till
you
come
to
read
over
they
nailed
up
on
all
the
doors
of
them
and
you
ca
help
breaking
if
you
try
ever
so
much
what
are
they
what
sort
of
rules
cried
katy
and
clover
in
a
breath
oh
about
being
punctual
to
prayers
and
turning
you
mattress
and
smoothing
over
the
before
you
leave
your
room
and
never
speaking
a
word
in
the
hall
or
in
private
study
hour
and
hanging
your
towel
on
your
own
nail
in
the
and
all
that
what
you
mean
said
katy
aghast
at
the
head
of
quaker
row
you
know
all
the
girls
wash
there
except
on
saturdays
when
they
go
to
the
you
have
your
own
bowl
and
and
a
hook
for
you
towel
why
what
the
matter
how
big
your
eyes
are
i
never
heard
any
thing
so
horrid
cried
katy
when
she
had
recovered
her
breath
do
you
really
mean
that
girls
do
have
in
their
own
rooms
you
get
used
to
it
all
the
girls
do
responded
lilly
i
do
want
to
get
used
to
it
said
katy
resolving
to
appeal
to
papa
but
papa
had
gone
into
the
and
she
had
to
wait
meantime
lilly
went
on
talking
if
you
have
that
end
room
in
quaker
row
you
see
all
the
fun
that
goes
on
at
commencement
time
searles
always
has
a
big
party
and
you
can
look
right
in
and
watch
the
people
and
the
just
as
if
you
were
there
last
summer
berry
and
alpheus
seccomb
got
a
lot
of
cakes
and
mottoes
from
the
table
and
came
out
into
the
yard
and
threw
them
up
one
by
one
to
rose
red
and
her
they
did
have
the
end
room
though
but
the
one
next
to
it
what
a
funny
name
rose
red
said
clover
oh
her
real
name
is
rosamond
redding
but
the
girls
call
her
rose
red
she
the
greatest
witch
in
the
school
not
exactly
pretty
you
know
but
sort
of
killing
and
fascinating
she
always
getting
into
the
most
awful
scrapes
florence
would
had
expelled
her
long
ago
if
she
had
been
such
a
favorite
and
redding
daughter
beside
he
a
member
of
congress
you
know
and
all
that
and
florence
is
quite
proud
of
having
rose
in
her
school
berry
searles
is
so
funny
she
continued
his
mother
is
a
horrid
old
thing
and
always
interfering
with
him
sometimes
when
he
has
a
party
of
fellows
in
his
room
and
they
playing
cards
we
can
see
her
coming
with
her
candle
through
the
house
and
when
she
gets
to
his
door
she
tries
it
and
then
she
knocks
and
calls
out
my
son
and
the
fellows
whip
the
cards
into
their
pockets
and
stick
the
bottles
under
the
table
and
get
out
their
books
and
dictionaries
like
a
flash
and
when
berry
unlocks
the
door
there
they
sit
studying
away
and
searles
looks
so
disappointed
i
thought
i
should
die
one
night
mary
andrews
and
i
laughed
so
i
verily
believe
that
if
carr
had
been
present
at
this
conversation
he
would
have
stopped
at
the
next
station
and
taken
the
girls
back
to
burnet
but
he
did
not
return
from
the
till
the
anecdotes
about
berry
were
finished
and
lilly
had
begun
again
on
florence
she
a
sort
of
queen
you
know
everybody
minds
her
she
tall
and
always
dresses
beautifully
her
eyes
are
lovely
but
when
she
gets
angry
they
perfectly
awful
rose
red
says
she
rather
face
a
mad
bull
any
day
than
florence
in
a
fury
and
rose
ought
to
know
for
she
had
more
reprimands
than
any
girl
in
school
how
many
girls
are
there
inquired
carr
there
were
last
term
i
do
know
how
many
there
be
this
for
they
say
florence
is
going
to
give
up
it
she
who
makes
the
school
so
popular
all
this
time
the
train
was
moving
northward
with
every
mile
the
country
grew
prettier
spring
had
not
fairly
opened
but
the
grass
was
green
and
the
buds
on
the
tress
gave
a
tender
color
to
the
woods
the
road
followed
the
river
which
here
and
there
turned
upon
itself
in
long
links
and
windings
ranges
of
blue
hills
closed
the
distance
now
and
then
a
nearer
mountain
rose
single
and
alone
from
the
plain
the
air
was
cool
and
full
of
brilliant
zest
which
the
western
girls
had
never
before
tasted
katy
felt
as
if
she
were
drinking
champagne
she
and
clover
flew
from
window
to
window
exclaiming
with
such
delight
that
lilly
was
surprised
i
ca
see
what
there
is
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
she
remarked
that
only
deerfield
it
quite
a
small
place
but
how
pretty
it
looks
nestled
in
among
the
hills
hills
are
lovely
clover
are
they
these
hills
are
nothing
you
should
see
the
white
mountains
said
the
experienced
lilly
ma
and
i
spent
three
weeks
at
the
profile
house
last
vacation
it
was
perfectly
elegant
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
katy
drew
papa
away
to
a
distant
seat
and
confided
her
distress
about
the
do
you
think
it
is
horrid
papa
aunt
izzie
always
said
that
it
is
not
to
take
a
every
morning
but
how
can
we
with
girls
in
the
room
i
do
see
what
we
are
going
to
do
i
fancy
we
can
arrange
it
do
be
distressed
my
dear
replied
carr
and
katy
was
satisfied
for
when
papa
undertook
to
arrange
things
they
were
very
apt
to
be
done
it
was
almost
evening
when
they
reached
their
final
stopping
place
now
two
miles
in
the
stage
and
then
we
at
the
horrid
old
nunnery
said
lilly
ugh
look
at
that
snow
it
never
melts
here
till
long
after
it
all
gone
at
home
how
i
do
hate
this
station
i
going
to
be
awfully
homesick
i
know
i
am
but
just
then
she
caught
sight
of
the
stagecoach
which
stood
waiting
and
her
mood
changed
for
the
stage
was
full
of
girls
who
had
come
by
the
other
train
hurrah
there
mary
edwards
and
mary
silver
she
exclaimed
and
i
declare
rose
red
o
you
precious
darling
how
do
you
do
scrambling
up
the
steps
who
plunged
at
a
girl
with
waving
hair
and
a
rosy
mischievous
face
and
began
kissing
her
with
effusion
rose
red
did
not
seem
equally
enchanted
well
lilly
how
are
you
she
said
and
then
went
on
talking
to
a
girl
who
sat
by
her
side
and
whose
hand
she
held
while
lilly
rushed
up
and
down
the
line
embracing
and
being
embraced
she
did
not
introduce
katy
and
clover
and
as
papa
was
outside
on
the
box
they
felt
a
little
lonely
and
strange
all
the
rest
were
chattering
merrily
and
were
evidently
well
acquainted
they
were
the
only
ones
left
out
clover
watched
rose
red
to
whose
face
she
had
taken
a
fancy
it
made
her
think
of
a
pink
carnation
or
of
a
twinkling
wild
rose
with
saucy
whiskers
of
brown
calyx
whatever
she
said
or
did
seemed
full
of
a
flavor
especially
her
own
here
eyes
which
were
blue
and
not
very
large
sparkled
with
fun
and
mischief
her
cheeks
were
round
and
soft
like
a
baby
when
she
laughed
two
dimples
broke
their
pink
and
and
made
you
want
to
laugh
too
a
cunning
white
throat
supported
this
pretty
head
as
a
stem
supports
a
flower
and
altogether
she
was
like
a
flower
except
that
flowers
do
talk
and
she
talked
all
the
time
what
she
said
seemed
droll
for
the
girls
about
here
were
in
fits
of
laughter
but
clover
only
caught
a
word
now
and
then
the
stage
made
such
a
noise
suddenly
rose
red
leaned
forward
and
touched
clover
hand
what
your
name
she
said
you
got
eyes
like
my
sister
are
you
coming
to
the
nunnery
yes
replied
clover
smiling
back
my
name
is
clover
clover
carr
what
a
dear
little
name
it
sounds
just
as
you
look
so
does
your
name
rose
red
said
clover
shyly
it
a
ridiculous
name
protested
rose
red
trying
to
pout
just
then
the
stage
stopped
why
who
going
to
the
hotel
cried
the
in
a
chorus
i
am
said
carr
putting
his
head
in
at
the
door
with
a
smile
which
captivated
every
girl
there
come
katy
come
clover
decided
that
you
begin
school
till
oh
my
do
i
wish
he
was
my
pa
cried
rose
red
then
the
stage
moved
on
who
are
they
what
their
name
asked
the
girls
they
look
nice
they
sort
of
cousins
of
mine
and
they
come
from
the
west
replied
lilly
not
unwilling
to
own
the
relationship
now
that
she
perceived
that
carr
had
made
a
favorable
impression
why
on
earth
did
you
introduce
them
then
i
declare
that
was
just
like
you
lilly
page
put
in
rose
red
indignantly
they
looked
so
lonesome
that
i
wanted
to
pat
and
stroke
both
of
that
little
one
has
the
sweetest
eyes
meantime
katy
and
clover
entered
the
hotel
very
glad
of
the
reprieve
and
of
one
more
quiet
evening
alone
with
papa
they
needed
to
get
their
ideas
straightened
out
and
put
to
rights
after
the
confusions
of
the
day
and
lilly
extraordinary
talk
it
was
very
evident
that
the
nunnery
was
to
be
quite
different
from
their
expectations
but
another
thing
was
equally
evident
it
would
not
be
dull
rose
red
by
herself
and
without
any
one
to
help
her
would
be
enough
to
prevent
that
chapter
iv
the
nunnery
the
night
seemed
short
for
the
girls
tired
by
their
journey
slept
like
dormice
about
seven
katy
was
roused
by
the
click
of
a
blind
and
opening
her
eyes
saw
clover
standing
in
the
window
and
peeping
out
through
the
shutters
when
she
heard
katy
move
she
cried
out
oh
do
come
it
so
interesting
i
can
see
the
colleges
and
the
church
and
i
guess
the
nunnery
only
i
am
not
quite
sure
because
the
houses
are
all
so
much
alike
katy
jumped
up
and
hurried
to
the
window
the
hotel
stood
on
one
side
of
a
green
common
planted
with
trees
the
common
had
a
fence
and
gravel
paths
which
ran
across
it
from
corner
to
corner
opposite
the
hotel
was
a
long
row
of
red
buildings
broken
by
one
or
two
brown
ones
with
cupolas
these
were
evidently
the
colleges
and
a
large
gray
building
with
a
spire
was
as
evidently
the
church
but
which
one
of
the
many
white
house
which
filled
the
other
sides
of
the
common
was
the
nunnery
the
girls
could
not
tell
clover
thought
it
was
one
with
a
garden
at
the
side
but
katy
thought
not
because
lilly
had
said
nothing
of
a
garden
they
discussed
the
point
so
long
that
the
breakfast
bell
took
them
by
surprise
and
they
were
forced
to
rush
through
their
dressing
as
fast
as
possible
so
as
not
to
keep
papa
waiting
when
breakfast
was
over
carr
told
them
to
put
on
their
hats
and
get
ready
to
walk
with
him
to
the
school
clover
took
one
arm
and
katy
the
other
and
the
three
passed
between
some
posts
and
took
one
of
the
diagonal
paths
which
led
across
the
common
that
the
house
said
carr
pointing
it
is
the
one
you
picked
out
clover
said
katy
no
replied
clover
a
little
disappointed
the
house
papa
indicated
was
by
no
means
so
pleasant
as
the
one
she
had
chosen
it
was
a
tall
narrow
building
with
dormer
windows
in
the
roof
and
a
square
porch
supported
by
whitewashed
pillars
a
pile
of
trunks
stood
in
the
porch
from
above
came
sounds
of
voices
girls
heads
were
popped
out
of
upper
widows
at
the
swinging
of
the
gate
and
as
the
door
opened
more
heads
appeared
looking
over
the
balusters
from
the
hall
above
the
parlor
into
which
they
were
taken
was
full
of
heavy
furniture
stiffly
arranged
the
sofa
and
chairs
were
covered
with
black
haircloth
and
stood
closely
against
the
wall
some
books
lay
upon
the
table
arranged
two
by
two
each
upper
book
being
exactly
at
a
right
angle
with
each
lower
book
a
bunch
of
dried
grasses
stood
in
the
there
were
no
pictures
except
one
portrait
in
oils
of
a
forbidding
old
gentleman
in
a
wig
and
glasses
sitting
with
his
finger
majestically
inserted
in
a
bible
altogether
it
was
not
a
cheerful
room
nor
one
calculated
to
raise
the
spirits
of
and
katy
whose
long
seclusion
had
made
her
sensitive
on
the
subject
of
rooms
shrank
instinctively
nearer
papa
as
they
went
in
two
ladies
rose
to
receive
them
one
a
tall
dignified
person
was
florence
the
other
she
introduced
as
my
assistant
principal
mrs
nipson
nipson
was
not
tall
she
had
a
round
face
pinched
lips
and
gray
eyes
this
lady
is
fully
associated
with
me
in
the
management
of
the
school
explained
florence
when
i
go
she
will
assume
entire
control
is
that
likely
to
be
soon
inquired
carr
surprised
and
not
well
pleased
that
the
teacher
of
whom
he
had
heard
and
with
whom
he
had
proposed
to
leave
his
children
was
planning
to
yield
her
place
to
a
stranger
the
time
is
not
yet
determined
replied
florence
then
she
changed
the
subject
gracefully
but
so
decidedly
that
carr
had
no
chance
for
further
question
she
spoke
of
classes
and
discussed
what
katy
and
clover
were
to
study
finally
she
proposed
to
take
them
upstairs
to
see
their
room
papa
might
come
too
she
said
i
dare
say
that
lilly
page
who
tells
me
that
she
is
a
cousin
of
yours
has
described
the
arrangements
of
the
house
she
remarked
to
katy
the
room
i
have
assigned
to
you
is
in
the
back
building
row
the
girls
call
it
she
smiled
as
she
spoke
and
katy
meeting
her
eyes
for
the
fist
time
felt
that
there
was
something
in
what
lilly
had
said
florence
a
sort
of
queen
they
went
upstairs
some
girls
who
were
peeping
over
the
baluster
hurried
away
at
their
approach
florence
shook
her
head
at
them
the
first
day
is
always
one
of
license
she
said
leading
the
way
along
an
uncarpeted
entry
to
a
door
at
the
end
from
which
by
a
couple
of
steps
they
went
down
into
a
square
room
round
three
sides
of
which
ran
a
shelf
on
which
stood
rows
of
and
pitchers
above
were
hooks
for
towels
katy
perceived
that
this
was
the
dreaded
our
lavatory
remarked
florence
blandly
opening
from
the
was
a
very
long
hall
lighted
at
each
end
by
a
window
the
doors
on
either
side
were
numbered
one
two
three
and
so
on
some
of
them
were
half
open
as
they
went
by
katy
and
clover
caught
glimpses
of
girls
and
trunks
and
beds
strewed
with
things
at
no
florence
paused
here
is
the
room
which
i
propose
to
give
you
she
said
katy
and
clover
looked
eagerly
about
it
was
a
small
room
but
the
sun
shone
in
cheerfully
at
the
window
there
was
a
maple
bedstead
and
table
a
couple
of
chairs
and
a
row
of
hooks
that
was
all
except
that
in
the
wall
was
set
a
case
of
drawers
with
above
them
these
take
the
place
of
a
bureau
and
hold
your
clothes
explained
florence
pulling
out
one
of
the
drawers
i
hope
when
once
you
are
settled
you
will
find
yourselves
comfortable
the
rooms
are
small
but
young
people
do
not
require
so
much
space
as
older
ones
though
indeed
your
elder
daughter
carr
looks
more
advanced
and
that
i
was
prepared
to
find
her
what
did
you
say
was
her
age
she
is
past
sixteen
but
she
has
been
so
long
confined
to
her
room
by
the
illness
of
which
i
wrote
that
you
may
probably
find
her
behind
in
some
respects
which
reminds
me
this
was
very
adroit
of
papa
i
am
anxious
that
she
should
keep
up
the
system
to
which
she
has
been
accustomed
at
home
among
other
things
of
cold
water
every
morning
and
as
i
see
that
the
bedrooms
are
not
furnished
with
i
will
ask
your
permission
to
provide
one
for
the
use
of
my
little
girls
perhaps
you
will
kindly
tell
me
where
i
would
look
for
it
florence
was
not
pleased
but
she
could
not
object
so
she
mentioned
a
shop
katy
heart
gave
a
bound
of
relief
she
thought
no
with
a
might
be
very
comfortable
its
bareness
and
simplicity
had
the
charm
of
novelty
then
there
was
something
very
interesting
to
her
in
the
idea
of
a
whole
house
full
of
girls
they
did
not
stay
long
after
seeing
the
room
but
went
off
on
a
shopping
excursion
shops
were
few
and
far
between
at
hillsover
but
they
found
a
neat
little
maple
and
and
papa
also
bought
a
comfortable
low
chair
with
a
slatted
back
and
a
cushion
this
was
for
katy
never
study
till
your
back
aches
he
told
her
when
you
are
tired
lie
flat
on
the
bed
for
half
an
hour
and
tell
florence
that
it
was
by
my
direction
or
nipson
said
katy
laughing
rather
ruefully
she
had
taken
no
fancy
to
nipson
and
did
not
enjoy
the
idea
of
a
divided
authority
a
hurried
lunch
at
the
hotel
followed
and
then
it
was
time
for
carr
to
go
away
they
all
walked
to
the
school
together
and
said
upon
the
steps
the
girls
would
not
cry
but
they
clung
very
tightly
to
papa
and
put
as
much
feeling
into
their
last
kisses
as
would
have
furnished
forth
half
a
dozen
fits
of
tears
lilly
might
have
thought
them
but
papa
did
not
he
knew
better
that
my
brave
girls
he
said
then
he
kissed
them
once
more
and
hurried
away
perhaps
he
did
not
wish
them
to
see
that
his
eyes
too
were
a
little
misty
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
katy
and
clover
realized
that
they
were
alone
among
strangers
the
sensation
was
not
pleasant
and
they
felt
forlorn
as
they
went
upstairs
and
down
quaker
row
toward
no
aha
so
you
going
to
be
next
door
said
a
gay
voice
as
they
passed
no
and
rose
red
popped
her
head
into
the
hall
well
i
glad
she
went
on
shaking
hands
cordially
i
sort
of
thought
you
would
and
yet
i
did
know
and
there
are
some
awful
stiffies
among
the
new
girls
how
do
you
both
do
oh
are
we
next
door
to
you
cried
clover
brightening
yes
it
rather
good
of
me
not
to
hate
you
for
i
wanted
the
end
room
myself
and
florence
would
give
it
to
me
come
in
and
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
it
against
the
rules
but
that
no
matter
nobody
pretends
to
keep
rules
the
first
day
they
went
in
was
precisely
like
no
in
shape
size
and
furniture
but
rose
had
unpacked
her
trunk
and
decorated
the
room
with
odds
and
ends
of
all
sorts
the
table
was
covered
with
books
and
boxes
colored
lithographs
were
pinned
on
the
walls
a
huge
blue
rosette
ornamented
the
of
the
bed
the
blinds
were
tied
together
with
pink
ribbon
over
the
top
of
the
window
was
a
festoon
of
hemlock
boughs
fresh
and
spicy
the
effect
was
fantastic
but
cheery
and
katy
and
clover
exclaimed
with
one
voice
how
pretty
the
was
a
pale
shy
girl
with
a
look
in
her
eyes
and
small
hands
which
twisted
uneasily
together
when
she
moved
and
spoke
her
name
was
mary
silver
she
and
rose
were
so
utterly
unlike
that
katy
thought
it
odd
they
should
have
chosen
to
be
together
afterward
she
understood
it
better
rose
liked
to
protect
and
mary
to
be
protected
rose
to
talk
and
mary
to
listen
mary
evidently
considered
rose
the
most
entertaining
creature
in
the
world
she
giggled
violently
at
all
her
jokes
and
then
stopped
short
and
covered
her
mouth
with
her
fingers
in
a
frightened
way
as
if
giggling
were
wrong
only
think
mary
began
rose
after
introducing
katy
and
clover
these
young
ladies
have
got
the
end
room
what
do
you
suppose
was
the
reason
that
florence
did
not
give
it
to
us
it
very
peculiar
mary
laughed
her
uneasy
laugh
she
looked
as
if
she
could
tell
the
reason
but
did
not
dare
never
mind
continued
rose
trials
are
good
for
one
they
say
it
something
to
have
nice
people
in
the
room
if
we
ca
be
there
ourselves
you
are
nice
are
you
turning
to
clover
very
replied
clover
laughing
i
thought
so
i
can
almost
always
tell
without
asking
still
it
is
something
to
have
it
on
the
best
authority
we
be
good
neighbors
wo
we
look
here
and
she
pulled
one
of
the
drawers
completely
out
and
laid
it
on
the
bed
do
you
see
your
drawers
are
exactly
behind
ours
at
any
time
in
silent
study
hour
if
i
have
something
i
want
to
say
i
rap
and
pop
a
note
into
your
drawer
and
you
can
do
the
same
to
me
is
it
fun
clover
said
yes
but
katy
though
she
laughed
shook
her
head
do
entice
us
into
mischief
she
said
oh
gracious
exclaimed
rose
now
are
you
going
to
be
good
you
two
if
you
are
just
break
the
news
at
once
and
have
it
over
i
can
bear
it
she
fanned
herself
in
such
a
comical
way
that
no
one
could
help
laughing
mary
silver
joined
but
stopped
pretty
soon
in
her
sudden
manner
there
mary
now
went
on
rose
she
a
paragon
but
if
any
more
are
coming
into
the
entry
just
give
me
fair
notice
and
i
pack
and
move
up
among
the
sinners
in
attic
row
somehow
you
do
look
like
paragons
either
you
especially
nodding
to
clover
your
eyes
are
like
violets
but
so
are
sylvia
that
my
sister
and
she
the
greatest
witch
in
massachusetts
eyes
are
dreadfully
deceitful
things
as
for
you
to
katy
you
so
tall
that
i
ca
take
you
in
all
at
once
but
the
piece
i
see
does
look
dreadful
a
bit
rose
was
sitting
in
the
window
as
she
made
these
remarks
and
leaning
forward
suddenly
she
gave
a
pretty
blushing
nod
to
some
one
below
katy
glanced
down
and
saw
a
handsome
young
man
replacing
the
cap
he
had
lifted
from
his
head
that
berry
searles
said
rose
he
the
president
son
you
know
he
always
comes
through
the
side
yard
to
get
to
his
room
that
it
the
one
with
the
red
curtain
it
exactly
opposite
your
window
do
you
see
so
it
is
exclaimed
katy
remembering
what
lilly
had
said
oh
was
that
the
reason
she
stopped
afraid
of
being
rude
the
reason
we
wanted
the
room
inquired
rose
coolly
well
i
do
know
it
had
occurred
to
me
to
look
at
it
in
that
light
mary
with
sudden
severity
is
it
possible
that
you
had
berry
searles
in
your
mind
when
you
were
so
pertinacious
about
that
room
rose
how
can
you
you
know
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
protested
poor
mary
i
hope
not
otherwise
i
should
feel
it
my
duty
to
consult
with
florence
on
the
subject
went
on
rose
with
an
air
of
dignified
admonition
i
consider
myself
responsible
for
you
and
your
morals
mary
let
us
change
this
painful
subject
she
looked
gravely
at
the
three
girls
for
a
moment
then
her
lips
began
to
twitch
the
irresistible
dimples
appeared
in
her
cheeks
and
throwing
herself
back
in
her
chair
she
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
o
mary
you
blessed
goose
some
day
or
other
you
be
the
death
of
me
dear
dear
how
i
am
behaving
it
perfectly
horrid
of
me
and
i
did
mean
it
i
going
to
be
real
good
this
term
i
promised
mother
please
forget
it
and
do
take
a
dislike
to
me
and
never
come
again
she
added
coaxingly
as
katy
and
clover
rose
to
go
indeed
we
wo
replied
katy
as
for
sensible
clover
she
was
already
desperately
in
love
with
rose
on
that
very
first
day
after
a
couple
of
hours
of
hard
work
no
was
in
order
and
looked
like
a
different
place
fringed
towels
were
laid
over
the
and
the
table
carr
photograph
and
some
pretty
chromos
ornamented
the
walls
the
and
the
stood
by
the
window
the
trunks
were
hidden
by
chintz
covers
made
for
the
purpose
by
old
mary
on
the
stood
cousin
helen
vase
which
katy
had
brought
carefully
packed
among
her
clothes
now
she
said
tying
the
blinds
together
with
a
knot
of
ribbon
in
imitation
of
rose
red
when
we
get
a
bunch
of
wild
flowers
for
my
vase
we
shall
be
all
right
a
tap
at
the
door
rose
entered
are
you
done
she
asked
may
i
come
in
and
see
oh
this
is
pretty
she
exclaimed
looking
about
how
you
can
tell
in
one
minute
what
sort
of
a
girl
one
is
just
by
looking
at
her
room
i
should
know
you
had
been
neat
and
dainty
and
housekeepery
all
your
days
and
you
would
see
in
a
minute
that
i
a
madge
wildfire
and
that
ellen
gray
is
a
saint
and
sally
satterlee
a
scatterbrain
and
lilly
page
an
affected
little
hum
oh
i
forgot
she
is
your
cousin
is
she
how
dreadfully
rude
of
me
dimpling
at
clover
who
could
help
dimpling
back
again
oh
my
she
went
on
a
i
declare
where
did
you
get
it
papa
bought
it
explained
katy
he
asked
florence
permission
how
bright
of
him
i
shall
just
write
to
my
father
to
ask
for
permission
too
which
she
did
and
the
result
was
that
it
set
the
fashion
of
and
so
many
papas
wrote
to
ask
permission
that
florence
found
it
necessary
to
give
up
the
lavatory
system
and
provide
for
the
whole
house
katy
request
had
been
the
opening
wedge
i
do
not
think
this
fact
made
her
more
popular
with
the
principals
by
the
way
where
is
lilly
asked
katy
i
have
seen
her
do
you
want
to
know
i
can
tell
you
she
sitting
on
the
edge
of
one
chair
with
her
feet
on
the
rung
of
another
chair
and
her
head
on
the
shoulder
of
her
who
is
dying
to
get
away
and
arrange
her
drawers
and
she
crying
how
do
you
know
have
you
been
up
to
see
her
oh
i
have
seen
her
it
is
necessary
i
saw
her
last
term
and
the
term
before
she
always
spends
the
first
day
at
school
in
that
way
i
take
you
up
if
you
like
to
examine
for
yourselves
katy
and
clover
much
amused
followed
as
she
led
the
way
upstairs
sure
enough
lilly
was
sitting
exactly
as
rose
had
predicted
her
face
was
swollen
from
crying
when
she
saw
the
girls
her
sobs
redoubled
oh
is
it
dreadful
she
demanded
i
shall
die
i
know
i
shall
oh
why
did
pa
make
me
come
now
lilly
do
be
an
idiot
said
the
unsympathizing
rose
then
she
sat
down
and
proceeded
to
make
a
series
of
the
most
grotesque
faces
winking
her
eyes
and
twinkling
her
fingers
round
the
head
of
niobe
as
she
called
lilly
till
the
other
girls
were
in
fits
of
laughter
and
niobe
though
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
pettishly
and
said
do
be
so
ridiculous
rose
red
was
forced
to
give
way
first
she
smiled
then
a
laugh
was
heard
afterward
she
announced
that
she
felt
better
that
right
niobe
said
rose
wash
your
face
now
and
get
ready
for
tea
for
the
bell
is
just
going
to
ring
as
for
you
annie
you
might
as
well
put
your
drawers
in
order
with
a
wicked
wink
annie
hurried
away
with
a
laugh
which
she
tried
in
vain
to
hide
you
heartless
creature
cried
the
exasperated
lilly
i
believe
you
made
of
marble
you
have
one
bit
of
feeling
nor
you
either
katy
you
have
cried
a
drop
given
this
problem
said
the
provoking
rose
when
the
nose
without
is
as
red
as
a
lobster
what
must
be
the
temperature
of
the
heart
within
and
versa
the
rang
just
in
time
to
avert
a
fresh
flood
of
tears
from
lilly
she
brushed
her
hair
in
angry
haste
and
they
all
hurried
down
by
a
side
staircase
which
as
rose
explained
the
were
expected
to
use
the
was
not
large
only
part
of
the
girls
could
be
seated
at
a
time
so
they
took
turns
at
dining
at
the
first
table
half
one
week
and
half
the
next
nipson
sat
at
the
with
florence
beside
her
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
board
sat
a
person
whom
lilly
announced
in
a
whisper
as
that
horrid
miss
jane
the
meal
was
very
simple
tea
bread
and
butter
and
dried
beef
it
was
eaten
in
silence
the
girls
were
not
allowed
to
speak
except
to
ask
for
what
they
wanted
rose
red
indeed
who
sat
next
to
florence
talked
to
her
and
even
ventured
once
or
twice
on
daring
little
jokes
which
caused
clover
to
regard
her
with
admiring
astonishment
no
one
else
said
any
thing
except
butter
please
or
pass
the
bread
as
they
filed
upstairs
after
this
cheerless
meal
they
were
met
by
rows
of
hungry
girls
who
were
waiting
to
go
down
and
who
whispered
how
long
you
have
been
what
for
tea
the
evening
passed
in
making
up
classes
and
arranging
for
rooms
and
katy
was
glad
when
came
the
day
with
all
its
new
impressions
and
strange
faces
seemed
to
her
like
a
confused
dream
she
and
clover
undressed
very
quietly
among
the
printed
rules
which
hung
on
the
bedroom
door
they
read
all
communication
between
after
the
retiring
bell
has
rung
is
strictly
prohibited
just
then
it
did
not
seem
difficult
to
keep
this
rule
it
was
only
after
the
candle
was
blown
out
that
clover
ventured
to
whisper
very
low
indeed
for
who
knew
but
miss
jane
was
listening
outside
the
door
do
you
think
you
going
to
like
it
and
katy
in
the
same
cautious
whisper
responded
i
not
quite
sure
and
so
ended
the
first
day
at
the
nunnery
chapter
roses
and
thorns
oh
what
is
it
what
has
happened
cried
clover
starting
up
in
bed
the
next
morning
as
a
clanging
sound
roused
her
suddenly
from
sleep
it
was
only
the
ringing
at
the
end
of
quaker
row
katy
held
her
watch
up
to
the
dim
light
she
could
just
see
the
hands
yes
they
pointed
to
six
it
was
actually
morning
she
and
clover
jumped
up
and
began
to
dress
as
fast
as
possible
we
only
got
half
an
hour
said
clover
unhooking
the
rules
and
carrying
them
to
the
window
half
an
hour
and
this
says
that
we
must
turn
the
mattress
smooth
the
over
the
bolster
and
spend
five
minutes
in
silent
devotion
we
have
to
be
quick
to
do
all
that
besides
dressing
ourselves
it
is
never
easy
to
be
quick
when
one
is
in
a
hurry
every
thing
sets
itself
against
you
fingers
turn
into
thumbs
dresses
button
nor
pins
keep
their
place
with
all
their
haste
katy
and
clover
were
barely
ready
when
the
second
bell
sounded
as
they
hastened
downstairs
katy
fastening
her
and
clover
her
cuffs
they
met
other
girls
some
looking
half
asleep
some
half
dressed
all
yawning
rubbing
their
eyes
and
complaining
of
the
early
hour
is
it
horrid
said
lilly
page
hurrying
by
with
no
collar
on
and
her
hair
hastily
tucked
into
a
net
i
never
get
up
till
nine
when
i
at
home
ma
saves
my
breakfast
for
me
she
says
i
shall
have
my
sleep
out
while
i
have
the
chance
you
do
look
quite
awake
now
remarked
clover
no
because
i
have
washed
my
face
half
the
time
i
do
before
breakfast
there
that
old
mattress
has
to
be
turned
and
when
i
sleep
over
i
just
do
that
first
and
then
scramble
my
clothes
on
the
best
way
i
can
any
thing
not
to
be
marked
after
prayers
and
breakfast
were
done
the
girls
had
half
an
hour
for
putting
their
bedrooms
to
rights
during
which
interval
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
lilly
found
time
to
wash
her
face
after
that
lessons
began
and
lasted
till
one
dinner
followed
with
an
recreation
then
the
bell
rang
for
silent
study
hour
when
the
girls
sat
with
their
books
in
their
bedrooms
but
were
not
allowed
to
speak
to
each
other
next
came
a
walk
who
are
you
going
to
walk
with
asked
rose
red
meeting
clover
in
quaker
row
i
do
know
katy
i
guess
are
you
really
you
and
she
like
each
other
do
you
do
you
know
you
the
first
sisters
i
ever
knew
at
school
who
did
generally
they
quarrel
awfully
the
stearns
girls
who
were
here
last
term
scarcely
spoke
to
each
other
they
did
even
room
together
and
sarah
stearns
was
always
telling
tales
against
sue
and
sue
against
sara
how
disgusting
i
never
heard
of
any
thing
so
mean
cried
clover
indignantly
why
i
would
tell
tales
about
katy
if
we
quarrelled
ever
so
much
we
never
do
though
katy
is
so
sweet
i
suppose
she
is
said
rose
rather
doubtfully
but
do
you
know
i
sort
of
afraid
of
her
it
because
she
so
tall
tall
people
always
scare
me
and
then
she
looks
so
grave
and
grown
up
tell
her
i
said
so
though
for
i
want
her
to
like
me
oh
she
is
a
bit
grave
or
grown
up
she
the
funniest
girl
in
the
world
wait
till
you
know
her
replied
loyal
clover
i
give
any
thing
if
i
could
walk
with
you
part
of
this
term
went
on
rose
putting
her
arm
round
clover
waist
but
you
see
unluckily
i
engaged
straight
through
all
of
us
old
girls

i
walk
with
may
mather
this
week
and
next
then
esther

a
month
then
lilly
page
for
two
weeks
and
all
the
rest
of
the
time
with
mary
i
ca
think
why
i
promised
lilly
i
sure
i
do
want
to
go
with
her
i
ask
mary
to
let
me
off
only
afraid
she
feel
bad
i
say
suppose
we
engage
now
to
walk
with
each
other
for
the
first
half
of
next
term
why
that
not
till
october
said
clover
i
know
it
but
it
nice
to
be
beforehand

you

course
i
will
provided
that
katy
has
somebody
pleasant
to
go
with
replied
clover
immensely
flattered
at
being
asked
by
the
popular
rose
then
they
ran
downstairs
and
took
their
places
in
the
long
procession
of
girls
who
were
ranged
two
and
two
ready
to
start
miss
jane
walked
at
the
head
and
miss
marsh
another
teacher
brought
up
the
rear
rose
red
whispered
that
it
was
like
a
funeral
and
a
caravan
mixed
as
cheerful
as
hearses
at
both
ends
and
wild
beasts
in
the
middle
the
walk
was
along
a
wooded
road
a
mile
out
and
a
mile
back
the
procession
was
not
permitted
to
stop
or
straggle
or
take
any
of
the
liberties
which
make
walking
pleasant
still
katy
and
clover
enjoyed
it
there
was
a
spring
smell
in
the
air
and
the
woods
were
beginning
to
be
pretty
they
even
found
a
little
trailing
aribitus
blossoming
in
a
sunny
hollow
lilly
was
just
in
front
of
them
and
amused
them
with
histories
of
different
girls
whom
she
pointed
out
in
the
long
line
that
was
esther
dearborn
rose
red
friend
handsome
was
she
but
awfully
sarcastic
the
two
next
were
amy
alsop
and
ellen
gray
they
always
walked
together
because
they
were
so
intimate
yes
they
were
nice
enough
only
so
distressingly
good
amy
did
not
get
one
single
mark
last
term
that
child
with
was
bella
arkwright
why
on
earth
did
katy
want
to
know
her
she
was
a
nasty
little
thing
she
just
about
elsie
height
replied
katy
who
that
pretty
girl
with
pink
velvet
on
her
hat
dear
me
do
you
think
she
pretty
i
do
her
name
is
louisa
agnew
she
lives
at
ashburn
quite
near
us
but
we
do
know
them
her
family
are
not
at
all
in
good
society
what
a
pity
she
looks
sweet
and
lilly
tossed
her
head
they
quite
common
people
she
said
they
live
in
a
little
mite
of
a
house
and
her
father
paints
portraits
but
i
should
think
that
would
be
nice
does
she
ever
take
you
to
see
his
pictures
take
me
cried
lilly
indignantly
i
should
think
not
i
tell
you
we
do
visit
i
just
speak
when
we
here
but
i
never
see
her
when
i
at
home
move
on
young
ladies
what
are
you
stopping
for
cried
miss
jane
yes
move
on
muttered
rose
red
from
behind
do
you
hear
policeman
x
from
till
was
recreation
again
lilly
improved
this
opportunity
to
call
at
no
she
had
waited
to
see
how
the
girls
were
likely
to
take
in
the
school
before
committing
herself
to
intimacy
but
now
that
rose
red
had
declared
in
their
favor
she
was
ready
to
begin
to
be
friendly
how
lovely
she
said
looking
about
you
got
the
end
room
after
all
did
you
what
splendid
times
you
have
oh
how
plainly
you
can
see
berry
searles
window
has
he
spoken
to
you
yet
spoken
to
us
of
course
not
why
should
he
replied
katy
he
does
know
us
and
we
do
know
him
that
nothing
half
the
girls
in
the
school
bow
and
speak
and
carry
on
with
young
men
they
do
know
you
wo
have
a
bit
of
fun
if
you
so
particular
i
do
want
that
kind
of
fun
replied
katy
with
energy
in
her
voice
neither
does
clover
and
i
ca
imagine
how
the
girls
can
behave
so
it
is
at
all
katy
was
very
fond
of
this
word
she
always
laid
great
stress
upon
it
it
seemed
in
some
way
to
be
connected
with
cousin
helen
and
to
mean
every
thing
that
was
good
and
graceful
and
sweet
dear
me
i
no
idea
you
were
so
dreadfully
proper
said
lilly
pouting
mother
said
you
were
as
prim
and
precise
as
your
grandmother
but
i
did
suppose
how
unkind
broke
in
clover
taking
fire
as
usual
at
any
affront
to
katy
katy
prim
and
precise
she
is
a
bit
she
twice
as
much
fun
as
the
rest
of
you
girls
but
it
nice
fun
not
this
horrid
stuff
about
students
i
wish
your
mother
would
say
such
things
i
did
she
did
i
do
mean
exactly
that
stammered
lilly
frightened
by
clover
indignant
eyes
all
i
meant
was
that
katy
is
dreadfully
dignified
for
her
age
and
we
bad
girls
will
have
to
look
out
you
need
be
so
mad
clover
i
sure
it
very
nice
to
be
proper
and
good
and
set
an
example
i
do
want
to
preach
to
anybody
said
katy
coloring
and
i
was
thinking
about
examples
but
really
and
truly
lilly
your
mother
and
all
the
girls
mothers
be
shocked
if
they
knew
about
these
performances
here
gracious
i
should
think
so
ma
would
kill
me
i
would
have
her
know
of
my
goings
on
for
all
the
world
just
then
rose
pulled
out
a
drawer
and
called
through
to
ask
if
clover
would
please
come
in
and
help
her
a
minute
lilly
took
advantage
of
her
absence
to
say
i
came
on
purpose
to
ask
you
to
walk
with
me
for
four
weeks
will
you
thank
you
but
i
engaged
to
clover
to
clover
but
she
your
sister
you
can
get
off
i
do
want
to
get
off
clover
and
i
like
dearly
to
go
together
lilly
stared
well
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
she
said
really
romantic
the
girls
will
call
you
inseparables
i
would
mind
being
inseparable
from
clover
said
katy
laughing
next
day
was
saturday
it
was
nominally
a
holiday
but
so
many
tasks
were
set
for
it
that
it
hardly
seemed
like
one
the
girls
had
to
practise
in
the
gymnasium
to
do
their
mending
and
have
all
drawers
in
order
before
afternoon
when
miss
jane
went
through
the
rooms
on
a
tour
of
inspection
saturday
also
was
the
day
for
writing
home
letters
so
altogether
it
was
about
the
busiest
of
the
week
early
in
the
morning
miss
jane
appeared
in
quaker
row
with
some
slips
of
paper
in
her
hand
one
of
which
she
left
at
each
door
they
told
the
hours
at
which
the
girls
were
to
go
to
the
you
will
carry
each
a
crash
towel
a
sponge
and
soap
she
announced
to
katy
and
will
be
in
the
entry
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
at
minutes
after
nine
precisely
failures
in
punctuality
will
be
punished
by
a
mark
miss
jane
always
delivered
her
words
like
a
machine
and
closed
her
mouth
with
a
snap
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
horrid
thing
do
i
wish
her
missionary
would
come
and
carry
her
off
not
that
i
blame
him
for
staying
away
remarked
rose
red
from
her
door
making
a
face
at
miss
jane
as
she
walked
down
the
entry
i
do
understand
about
the
said
katy
does
it
belong
to
us
and
where
is
it
no
it
does
belong
to
us
it
belongs
to
perrit
and
anybody
can
use
it
only
on
saturday
it
is
reserved
for
us
nuns
have
you
every
noticed
it
when
we
have
been
out
walking
it
in
that
street
by
the
bakery
which
we
pass
to
take
the
lebanon
road
we
go
across
the
green
and
down
by
professor
seccomb
and
we
are
in
plain
sight
from
the
college
all
the
way
and
of
course
those
abominable
boys
sit
there
with
and
stare
as
hard
as
ever
they
can
perfectly
horrid
crash
towel
a
sponge
and
soap
indeed
i
wish
i
could
make
miss
jane
eat
the
pieces
of
soap
which
she
has
forced
me
to
carry
across
this
village
o
rose
remonstrated
mary
silver
well
i
do
and
the
crash
towels
afterward
by
way
of
a
dessert
replied
the
incorrigible
rose
never
mind
just
wait
a
bright
idea
strikes
me
oh
what
cried
the
other
three
but
rose
only
pursed
up
her
mouth
arched
he
and
vanished
into
her
own
room
locking
the
door
behind
her
mary
silver
finding
herself
shut
out
sat
down
meekly
in
the
hall
till
such
time
as
it
should
please
rose
to
open
the
door
this
was
not
till
the
bath
hour
as
katy
and
clover
went
by
rose
put
her
head
out
and
called
that
she
would
be
down
in
a
minute
the
bathing
party
consisted
of
eight
girls
with
miss
jane
for
escort
they
were
half
way
across
the
common
before
miss
jane
noticed
that
everybody
was
shaking
with
stifled
laughter
except
rose
who
walked
along
demurely
apparently
unconscious
that
there
was
any
thing
to
laugh
at
miss
jane
looked
sharply
from
one
to
another
for
a
moment
then
stopped
short
and
exclaimed
rosamond
redding
how
dare
you
what
is
it
asked
rose
with
the
face
of
a
lamb
your
bath
towel
your
sponge
gasped
miss
jane
yes
i
have
them
all
replied
the
audacious
rose
putting
her
hand
to
her
hat
there
to
be
sure
was
the
long
crash
towel
hanging
down
behind
like
a
veil
while
the
sponge
was
fastened
on
one
side
like
a
great
cockade
and
in
front
appeared
a
cake
of
pink
soap
neatly
pinned
into
the
middle
of
a
black
velvet
bow
miss
jane
seized
rose
and
removed
these
ornaments
in
a
twinkling
we
shall
see
what
florence
thinks
of
this
conduct
she
grimly
remarked
then
dropping
the
soap
and
sponge
in
her
own
pocket
she
made
rose
walk
beside
her
as
if
she
were
a
criminal
in
custody
the
was
a
neat
place
with
eight
small
rooms
well
supplied
with
hot
and
cold
water
katy
would
have
found
her
bath
very
nice
had
it
not
been
for
the
thought
of
the
walk
home
they
must
look
so
absurd
she
reflected
with
their
sponges
and
damp
towels
miss
jane
was
as
good
as
her
word
after
dinner
rose
was
sent
for
by
florence
and
had
an
interview
of
two
hours
with
her
she
came
out
with
red
eyes
and
shut
herself
into
her
room
with
a
disconsolate
bang
before
long
however
she
revived
sufficiently
to
tap
on
the
drawers
and
push
through
a
note
with
the
following
words
my
heart
is
broken
clover
hastened
in
to
comfort
her
rose
was
sitting
on
the
floor
with
a
very
clean
in
her
hand
she
wept
and
put
her
head
against
clover
knee
i
suppose
i
the
nastiest
girl
in
the
world
she
said
florence
thinks
so
she
said
i
was
an
evil
influence
in
the
school
was
that
un
kind
with
a
little
sob
i
meant
to
be
so
good
this
term
she
went
on
but
what
the
use
a
codfish
might
as
well
try
to
play
the
piano
it
was
always
so
even
when
i
was
a
baby
sylvia
says
i
have
got
a
little
fiend
inside
of
me
do
you
believe
i
have
is
it
that
makes
me
so
horrid
clover
purred
over
her
she
could
not
bear
to
have
rose
feel
badly
was
miss
jane
funny
went
on
rose
with
a
sudden
twinkle
and
did
you
see
berry
and
alfred
seccomb
no
where
were
they
close
to
us
standing
by
the
fence
all
the
time
miss
jane
was
unpinning
the
towel
they
were
splitting
their
sides
and
berry
made
such
a
face
at
me
that
i
nearly
laughed
out
that
boy
has
a
perfect
genius
for
faces
he
used
to
frighten
sylvia
and
me
into
fits
when
we
were
little
tots
up
here
on
visits
then
you
knew
him
before
you
came
to
school
oh
dear
yes
i
know
all
the
hillsover
boys
we
used
to
make
mud
pies
together
they
grown
up
now
most
of
and
in
college
and
when
we
meet
we
very
dignified
and
say
redding
and
seccomb
and
searles
but
we
just
as
good
friends
as
ever
when
i
go
to
take
tea
with
seccomb
alfred
always
invites
berry
to
drop
in
and
we
have
the
greatest
fun
florence
let
me
go
this
term
though
i
guess
she
so
mad
about
the
towel
katy
was
quite
relieved
when
clover
reported
this
conversation
rose
for
all
her
wickedness
seemed
to
be
a
little
lady
katy
did
not
like
to
class
her
among
the
girls
who
flirted
with
students
whom
they
did
not
know
it
was
wonderful
how
soon
they
all
settled
down
and
became
accustomed
to
their
new
life
before
six
weeks
were
over
katy
and
clover
felt
as
if
they
had
lived
at
hillsover
for
years
this
was
partly
because
there
was
so
much
to
do
nothing
makes
time
fly
like
having
every
moment
filled
and
every
hour
set
apart
for
a
distinct
employment
they
made
several
friends
chief
among
whom
were
ellen
gray
and
louisa
agnew
this
last
intimacy
lilly
resented
highly
and
seemed
to
consider
as
an
affront
to
herself
with
no
one
however
was
katy
so
intimate
as
clover
was
with
rose
red
this
cost
katy
some
jealous
pangs
at
first
she
was
so
used
to
considering
clover
her
own
exclusive
property
that
it
was
not
easy
to
share
her
with
another
and
she
had
occasional
fits
of
feeling
resentful
and
injured
and
left
out
these
were
but
momentary
however
katy
was
too
healthy
of
mind
to
let
unkind
feelings
grow
and
by
and
by
she
grew
fond
of
rose
and
rose
of
her
so
that
in
the
end
the
sisters
share
their
friend
as
they
did
other
nice
things
and
neither
of
them
was
jealous
of
the
other
but
charming
as
she
was
a
certain
price
had
to
be
paid
for
the
pleasure
of
intimacy
with
rose
her
overflowing
spirits
and
the
little
fiend
inside
her
were
always
provoking
scrapes
in
which
her
friends
were
apt
to
be
more
or
less
involved
she
was
very
pen
intent
and
afflicted
after
these
scrapes
but
it
did
make
a
bit
of
difference
the
next
time
she
was
just
as
naughty
as
ever
what
are
you
said
katy
one
day
meeting
her
in
the
hall
with
a
heap
of
black
shawls
and
aprons
on
her
arm
hush
whispered
rose
mysteriously
do
say
a
word
senator
brown
is
dead
our
senator
you
know
i
going
to
put
my
window
into
mourning
for
him
that
all
it
a
proper
token
of
respect
two
hours
later
nipson
walking
sedately
across
the
common
noticed
quite
a
group
of
students
in
the
president
yard
looking
up
at
the
nunnery
she
drew
nearer
they
were
admiring
window
hung
with
black
and
decorated
with
a
photograph
of
the
deceased
senator
suspended
in
the
middle
of
a
wreath
of
willow
of
course
she
hurried
upstairs
and
tore
down
the
shawls
and
aprons
and
equally
of
course
rose
had
a
lecture
and
a
mark
but
dear
me
what
good
did
it
do
the
next
day
but
one
as
katy
and
clover
sat
together
in
silent
study
hour
their
lower
drawer
was
pushed
open
very
noiselessly
and
gently
till
it
came
out
entirely
and
lay
on
the
floor
and
in
the
aperture
thus
formed
appeared
saucy
face
flushed
with
mischief
she
was
crawling
through
from
her
own
room
such
fun
she
whispered
i
never
thought
of
this
before
we
can
have
parties
in
study
hours
and
all
sorts
of
things
oh
go
back
rosy
whispered
clover
in
agonized
entreaty
though
laughing
all
the
time
go
back
not
at
all
i
coming
in
answered
rose
pulling
herself
through
a
little
farther
but
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
there
stood
miss
jane
she
had
caught
the
buzz
of
voices
as
she
passed
in
the
hall
and
had
entered
to
see
what
was
going
on
rose
dreadfully
frightened
made
a
rapid
movement
to
withdraw
but
the
space
was
narrow
and
she
had
wedged
herself
and
could
move
neither
backward
nor
forward
she
had
to
submit
to
being
helped
through
by
miss
jane
in
a
series
of
pulls
while
katy
and
clover
sat
by
not
daring
to
laugh
or
to
offer
assistance
when
rose
was
on
her
feet
miss
jane
released
her
with
a
final
shake
which
she
seemed
unable
to
refrain
from
giving
go
to
your
room
she
said
i
shall
report
all
of
you
young
ladies
for
this
flagrant
act
of
disobedience
rose
went
and
in
two
minutes
the
drawer
which
miss
jane
had
replaced
opened
again
and
there
was
this
note
if
i
never
heard
of
more
give
my
love
to
my
family
and
mention
how
i
died
i
forgive
my
enemies
and
leave
clover
my
band
bracelet
my
blessings
on
you
both
with
the
deepest
regard
your
afflicted
friend
florence
was
very
angry
on
this
occasion
and
would
listen
to
no
explanations
but
gave
katy
and
clover
a
disobedience
mark
also
this
was
very
unfair
and
rose
felt
dreadfully
about
it
she
begged
and
entreated
but
florence
only
replied
there
is
blame
on
both
sides
i
have
no
doubt
she
entirely
changed
from
what
she
used
to
be
declared
rose
i
do
know
what
the
matter
i
do
like
her
half
so
much
as
i
did
the
truth
was
that
florence
had
secretly
determined
to
give
up
her
connection
with
the
school
at
midsummer
and
regarding
it
now
rather
as
nipson
school
than
her
own
she
took
no
pains
to
study
character
or
mete
out
justice
carefully
among
scholars
with
whom
she
was
not
likely
to
have
much
to
do
chapter
vi
the
it
was
saturday
afternoon
and
clover
having
finished
her
practising
dusting
and
mending
had
settle
herself
in
no
for
a
couple
of
hours
of
quiet
enjoyment
every
thing
was
in
beautiful
order
to
meet
miss
jane
inspecting
eye
and
clover
as
she
sat
in
the
rocking
chair
in
lap
looked
extremely
cosy
and
comfortable
a
letter
to
elsie
lay
in
the
but
clover
felt
lazy
and
instead
of
writing
was
looking
out
of
window
in
a
dreamy
way
to
where
berry
searles
and
some
other
young
men
were
playing
ball
in
the
yard
below
she
was
not
thinking
of
them
or
of
any
thing
else
in
particular
a
vague
sense
of
pleasant
idleness
possessed
her
and
it
was
like
the
breaking
of
a
dream
when
the
door
opened
and
katy
came
in
not
quietly
after
her
wont
but
with
a
certain
haste
and
indignant
rustle
as
if
vexed
by
something
when
she
saw
clover
at
the
window
she
cried
out
hastily
o
clover
do
do
what
asked
clover
without
turning
her
head
do
sit
there
looking
at
those
boys
why
why
not
they
ca
see
me
the
blinds
are
shut
no
matter
for
that
it
just
as
bad
as
if
they
could
see
you
do
it
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
well
i
wo
then
said
clover
facing
round
with
her
back
to
the
window
i
was
looking
at
them
either
not
exactly
i
was
thinking
about
elsie
and
john
and
wondering
but
what
the
matter
katy
what
makes
you
fire
up
so
about
it
watched
the
yourself
plenty
of
times
i
know
i
have
and
i
did
mean
to
be
cross
clovy
the
truth
is
i
am
all
put
out
these
girls
with
incessant
talk
about
the
students
make
me
absolutely
sick
it
is
so
unladylike
and
so
bad
especially
for
the
little
ones
fancy
that
mite
of
a
carrie
steele
informing
me
that
she
is
in
love
with
harry
crosby
in
love
a
baby
like
that
she
has
no
business
to
know
that
there
is
such
a
thing
yes
said
clover
laughing
she
wrote
his
name
on
a
wintergreen
lozenge
and
bored
a
hole
and
hung
it
round
her
neck
on
a
blue
ribbon
but
it
melted
and
stuck
to
her
frock
and
she
had
to
take
it
off
whereupon
she
ate
it
added
rose
who
came
in
at
that
moment
the
girls
shouted
but
katy
soon
grew
grave
one
ca
help
laughing
she
said
but
is
it
a
shame
to
have
such
things
going
on
just
fancy
our
elsie
behaving
so
clover
why
papa
would
have
a
fit
i
declare
i
a
great
mind
to
get
up
a
society
to
put
down
flirting
do
said
rose
what
fun
it
would
be
call
it
society
for
the
suppression
of
young
men
i
join
you
indeed
replied
katy
shaking
her
head
did
i
see
berry
searles
throw
a
bunch
of
syringa
into
your
window
only
this
morning
dear
me
did
he
i
shall
have
to
speak
to
mary
again
it
quite
shocking
to
have
her
go
on
so
but
really
and
truly
do
let
us
have
a
society
it
would
be
so
jolly
we
could
meet
on
saturday
afternoons
and
write
pieces
and
have
signals
and
a
secret
as
sylvia
society
did
when
she
was
at
school
get
one
up
katy
that
a
dear
but
said
katy
taken
aback
by
having
her
random
idea
so
suddenly
adopted
if
i
did
get
one
up
it
would
be
in
real
earnest
and
it
would
be
a
society
against
flirting
and
you
know
you
ca
help
it
rosy
yes
i
can
you
are
doing
me
great
injustice
i
do
behave
like
those
girls
in
attic
row
i
never
did
i
just
bow
to
berry
and
the
rest
whom
i
really
know
never
to
anybody
else
and
you
must
see
katherine
darling
that
it
would
be
the
height
of
ingratitude
if
i
did
bow
to
the
boys
who
made
mud
pies
for
me
when
i
was
little
and
lent
me
their
marbles
and
did
all
sorts
of
kind
things
now
would
it
coaxingly
per
haps
admitted
katy
with
a
smile
but
you
such
a
witch
i
not
indeed
i
not
i
be
a
pillar
of
society
if
only
provide
a
society
for
me
to
be
a
pillar
of
now
katy
do
ah
do
do
when
rose
was
in
a
coaxing
mood
few
people
could
resist
her
katy
yielded
and
between
jest
and
earnest
the
matter
was
settled
katy
was
to
head
the
plan
and
invite
the
members
only
a
few
at
first
suggested
rose
when
it
is
proved
to
be
a
success
and
everybody
wants
to
join
we
can
let
in
two
or
three
more
as
a
great
favor
what
shall
the
name
be
we
keep
it
a
secret
whatever
it
is
there
no
fun
in
a
society
without
a
secret
what
should
the
name
be
rose
invented
half
a
dozen
each
more
absurd
than
the
last
the
society
would
sound
well
she
insisted
or
no
the
was
better
yet
finally
they
settled
upon
the
society
for
the
suppression
of
unladylike
conduct
only
we
never
use
the
whole
name
said
rose
we
say
s
that
sounds
brisk
and
snappy
and
will
drive
the
whole
school
wild
with
curiosity
what
larks
how
i
long
to
begin
the
next
saturday
was
fixed
upon
for
the
first
meeting
during
the
week
katy
proposed
the
plan
to
the
elect
few
all
of
whom
accepted
enthusiastically
lilly
page
was
the
only
person
who
declined
she
said
it
would
be
stupid
that
for
her
part
she
did
set
up
to
be
proper
or
better
than
she
was
and
that
in
any
case
she
wish
to
be
mixed
up
in
a
society
of
which
miss
agnew
was
a
member
the
girls
did
not
break
their
hearts
over
this
refusal
they
had
felt
obliged
to
ask
her
for
relationship
sake
but
everybody
was
a
little
relieved
that
she
did
not
wish
to
join
no
looked
very
full
indeed
that
saturday
afternoon
when
the
came
together
for
the
first
time
ten
members
were
present
mary
silver
and
louisa
were
two
and
rose
crony
esther

another
the
remaining
four
were
sally
alsop
and
amy
erskine
alice
gibbons
one
of
the
new
scholars
whom
they
all
liked
but
did
not
know
very
well
and
ellen
gray
a
pale
quiet
girl
with
droll
blue
eyes
a
comical
twist
to
her
mouth
and
a
trick
of
saying
funny
things
in
such
a
demure
way
that
half
the
people
who
listened
never
found
out
that
they
were
funny
all
rose
chairs
had
been
borrowed
for
the
occasion
three
girls
sat
on
the
bed
and
three
on
the
floor
with
a
little
squeezing
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
everybody
katy
was
chosen
president
and
requested
to
take
the
as
a
sign
of
office
this
she
did
with
much
dignity
and
proceeded
to
read
the
constitution
and
of
the
society
which
had
been
drawn
up
by
rose
red
and
copied
on
an
immense
sheet
of
blue
paper
they
ran
thus
constitution
for
the
society
for
the
suppression
of
unladylike
conduct
known
to
the
uninitiated
as
the
article
i
the
object
of
this
society
is
twofold
it
combines
having
a
good
time
with
the
pursuit
of
virtue
article
ii
the
good
time
is
to
take
place
once
a
week
in
no
quaker
row
between
the
hours
of
four
and
six
article
iii
the
nature
of
the
good
time
is
to
be
decided
upon
by
a
committee
to
be
appointed
each
saturday
by
the
members
of
the
society
article
iv
virtue
is
to
be
pursued
at
all
times
and
in
all
seasons
by
the
members
of
the
society
setting
their
faces
against
the
practice
of
bowing
and
speaking
to
young
gentlemen
who
are
not
acquaintances
waving
of
pocket
handkerchiefs
signals
from
windows
and
any
species
of
conduct
which
would
be
thought
unladylike
by
nice
people
anywhere
and
especially
by
the
mammas
of
the
society
article
the
members
of
the
society
pledge
themselves
to
use
their
influence
against
these
practices
both
by
precept
and
example
in
witness
whereof

gray
next
followed
the
katy
had
not
been
able
to
see
the
necessity
of
having
any
but
rose
had
insisted
she
had
never
heard
of
a
society
without
them
she
said
and
she
did
think
it
would
be
legal
to
leave
them
out
it
had
cost
her
some
trouble
to
invent
them
but
at
last
they
stood
thus
no
the
members
of
the
will
observe
the
following
signals
the
this
is
given
by
inserting
the
first
and
middle
finger
of
the
right
hand
between
the
thumb
and
fourth
finger
of
the
respondent
left
and
describing
a
rotatory
motion
in
the
air
with
the
little
finger
b
much
practice
is
necessary
to
enable
members
to
exchange
this
signal
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
attract
attention
the
signal
of
this
signal
is
for
use
when
miss
jane
or
any
other
heaves
into
sight
it
consists
in
rubbing
the
nose
violently
and
at
the
same
time
giving
three
stamps
on
the
floor
with
the
left
foot
it
must
be
done
with
an
air
of
unconsciousness
the
signal
for
this
signal
is
for
use
when
immediate
communication
is
requisite
between
members
of
the
society
it
consists
of
a
pinch
on
the
back
of
the
right
hand
accompanied
by
the
word
holofernes
pronounced
in
a
low
voice
no
the
members
of
the
pledge
themselves
to
inviolable
secrecy
about
all
society
proceedings
no
the
members
of
the
will
bring
their
saturday
balls
to
swell
the
common
entertainment
no
members
having
boxes
from
home
are
at
liberty
to
contribute
such
part
of
the
contents
as
they
please
to
the
aforementioned
common
entertainment
here
the
ended
there
was
much
laughter
over
them
especially
over
the
last
why
did
you
put
that
in
rosy
asked
ellen
gray
it
strikes
me
as
hardly
necessary
oh
replied
rose
i
put
that
in
to
encourage
silvery
mary
there
she
expecting
a
box
soon
and
i
knew
that
she
would
pine
to
give
the
society
a
share
but
would
be
too
timid
to
propose
it
so
i
thought
i
would
just
pave
the
way
how
truly
kind
laughed
clover
now
said
the
president
the
entertainment
of
the
meeting
will
begin
by
the
reading
of
arbutus
a
poem
by
clover
had
been
very
unwilling
to
read
the
first
piece
and
had
only
yielded
after
much
coaxing
from
rose
who
had
bestowed
upon
her
in
consequence
the
name
of
quintia
curtia
she
felt
very
shy
as
she
stood
up
with
her
paper
in
hand
and
her
voice
trembled
perceptibly
but
after
a
minute
she
grew
used
to
the
sound
of
it
and
read
steadily
trailing
arbutus
i
always
think
when
looking
at
its
mingled
rose
and
white
of
the
pink
lips
of
children
put
up
to
say
cuddled
its
green
leaves
under
like
babies
in
their
beds
its
blossoms
shy
and
sunny
conceal
their
pretty
heads
and
when
i
lift
the
blanket
up
and
peep
inside
of
it
they
seem
to
give
me
smile
for
smile
nor
be
afraid
a
bit
dear
little
flower
the
earliest
of
all
the
flowers
that
are
twinkling
upon
the
bare
brown
earth
as
on
the
clouds
a
star
how
can
we
fail
to
love
it
well
or
prize
it
more
and
more
it
is
the
first
small
signal
that
winter
time
is
that
spring
has
not
forgotten
us
though
late
and
slow
she
be
but
is
upon
her
flying
way
and
we
her
face
shall
see
this
production
caused
quite
a
sensation
among
the
girls
they
had
never
heard
any
of
clover
verses
before
and
thought
these
wonderful
why
cried
sally
alsop
it
is
almost
as
good
as
tupper
sally
meant
this
for
a
great
compliment
for
she
was
devoted
to
the
proverbial
philosophy
a
poem
by
was
the
next
thing
on
the
list
esther
dearborn
rose
with
great
pomp
and
dignity
cleared
her
throat
put
on
a
pair
of
glasses
and
began
miss
jane
who
ran
to
catch
me
on
the
spot
if
i
the
slightest
rule
forgot
believing
and
excusing
not
miss
jane
who
lurked
outside
my
door
all
day
in
hopes
that
i
would
disobey
and
some
low
whispered
word
would
say
miss
jane
who
caught
our
half
way
through
the
wall
which
parted
her
from
two
friends
and
that
small
prank
made
her
rue
miss
jane
who
is
our
bane
our
foe
our
fear
who
always
certain
to
appear
just
when
we
do
not
think
her
near
miss
jane
who
down
the
hall
is
creeping
now
with
stealthy
step
but
knowing
not
how
exactly
to
discover
broke
in
rose
improvising
rapidly
next
moment
came
a
knock
at
the
door
it
was
miss
jane
your
drawers
miss
carr
your
cupboard
she
said
going
across
the
room
and
examining
each
in
turn
there
was
no
fault
to
be
found
with
either
so
she
withdrew
giving
the
laughing
girls
a
suspicious
glance
and
remarking
that
it
was
a
bad
habit
to
sit
on
beds
it
always
injured
them
do
you
suppose
she
heard
whispered
mary
silver
no
i
do
think
she
did
replied
rose
of
course
she
suspected
us
of
being
in
some
mischief
or
other
she
always
does
that
now
mary
it
you
turn
to
give
us
an
intellectual
treat
begin
poor
mary
shrank
back
blushing
and
protesting
you
know
i
ca
she
said
i
too
stupid
rubbish
cried
rose
you
the
dearest
girl
that
ever
was
she
gave
mary
shoulder
a
reassuring
pat
mary
is
excused
this
time
put
in
katy
it
is
the
first
meeting
so
i
shall
be
indulgent
but
after
this
every
member
will
be
expected
to
contribute
something
for
each
meeting
i
mean
to
be
very
strict
oh
i
never
never
can
cried
mary
rose
was
down
on
her
at
once
nonsense
hush
she
said
of
course

can
you
shall
if
i
have
to
write
it
for
you
myself
order
said
the
president
rapping
on
the
table
with
a
pencil
rose
has
something
to
read
us
rose
stood
up
with
great
gravity
i
would
ask
for
a
moment
delay
that
the
society
may
get
out
its
she
said
my
piece
is
an
affecting
one
i
did
mean
it
but
it
came
so
we
can
not
always
be
cheerful
here
she
heaved
a
sigh
which
set
the
to
laughing
and
began
a
scotch
poem
wee

loveliest
gems
that
burns
ever
wrote
i
thought
i
see
if
i
could
do
one
too
anybody
can
i
find
it
not
at
all
difficult
all
the
poems
having
been
read
katy
now
proposed
that
they
should
play
word
and
question
she
and
clover
were
accustomed
to
the
game
at
home
but
to
some
of
the
others
it
was
quite
new
each
girl
was
furnished
with
a
slip
of
paper
and
a
pencil
and
was
told
to
write
a
word
at
the
top
of
the
paper
fold
it
over
and
pass
it
to
her
next
neighbor
dear
me
i
do
know
what
to
write
said
mary
silver
oh
write
any
thing
said
clover
so
mary
obediently
wrote
any
thing
and
folded
it
over
what
next
asked
alice
gibbons
now
a
question
said
katy
write
it
under
the
word
and
fold
over
again
no
amy
not
the
fold
do
you
see
if
you
do
the
writing
will
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
paper
when
we
come
to
read
the
questions
were
more
troublesome
than
the
words
and
the
girls
sat
frowning
and
biting
their
for
some
minutes
before
all
were
done
as
the
slips
were
handed
in
katy
dropped
them
into
the
lid
of
her
and
thoroughly
mixed
and
stirred
them
up
now
she
said
passing
it
about
each
draw
one
read
and
write
a
rhyme
in
which
the
word
is
introduced
and
the
question
answered
it
need
be
more
than
two
lines
unless
you
like
here
rose
your
turn
first
oh
what
a
hard
game
cried
some
of
the
girls
but
pretty
soon
they
grew
interested
and
began
to
work
over
their
verses
i
should
uncommonly
like
to
know
who
wrote
this
abominable
word
said
rose
in
a
tone
of
despair
clover
you
rascal
i
believe
it
was
you
clover
peeped
over
her
shoulder
nodded
and
laughed
very
well
then
snatching
up
clover
slip
and
putting
her
own
in
its
place
you
can
just
write
on
it
yourself
i
sha
i
never
heard
of
such
a
word
in
my
life
you
made
it
up
for
the
occasion
you
know
you
did
i
did
it
in
the
bible
replied
clover
setting
to
work
composedly
on
the
fresh
paper
but
when
rose
opened
clover
slip
she
groaned
again
it
just
as
bad
as
the
other
she
cried
do
change
back
again
clovy
that
a
dear
no
indeed
said
clover
guarding
her
paper
you
changed
once
and
now
you
must
keep
what
you
have
rose
made
a
face
chewed
her
pencil
awhile
and
then
began
to
write
rapidly
for
some
minutes
not
a
word
was
spoken
i
done
said
esther
dearborn
at
last
flinging
her
paper
into
the
so
have
i
said
katy
one
by
one
the
papers
were
collected
and
jumbled
into
a
heap
then
katy
giving
all
a
final
shake
drew
out
one
opened
it
and
read
radishes
how
do
you
like
your
clergymen
done
how
do
i
like
them
done
well
that
depends
i
like
them
on
sleepy
drowsy
sundays
i
like
them
on
other
days
perhaps
a
little
on
mondays
but
always
i
prefer
them
old
as
pa
and
not
like
radishes
all
red
and
raw
oh
a
rhyme
cried
clover
well
what
is
one
to
do
said
ellen
gray
then
she
stopped
and
bit
her
lip
remembering
that
no
one
was
supposed
to
know
who
wrote
the
separate
papers
aha
it
your
is
it
ellen
said
rose
you
an
awfully
clever
girl
and
an
ornament
to
the
go
on
katy
katy
opened
the
second
slip
anything
would
you
rather
be
a
greater
fool
than
you
seem
or
seem
a
greater
fool
than
you
are
i
would
seem
a
fool
for
anything
my
dear
if
i
could
help
it
but
i
ca
i
fear
not
bad
said
rose
nodding
her
head
at
sally
alsop
who
blushed
crimson
the
third
paper
ran
mahershahalhashbaz
does
your
mother
know
you
out
rose
and
clover
exchanged
looks
why
of
course
my
mother
knows
it
for
she
sent
me
out
herself
she
told
me
to
run
quickly
for
it
was
but
a
mile
but
i
found
it
was
much
farther
and
my
feet
grew
tired
and
weary
and
i
could
hurry
greatly
so
i
took
a
long
long
while
beside
i
stopped
to
read
your
word
a
stranger
one
i
never
heard
i
met
with
that
pat
but
what
that
oh
clovy
you
bright
little
thing
cried
rose
in
fits
of
laughter
but
mary
silver
looked
quite
pale
i
never
heard
of
any
thing
so
awful
she
said
if
that
word
had
come
to
me
i
should
have
fainted
away
on
the
spot
i
know
i
should
next
came
buttons
what
is
the
best
way
to
make
home
happy
to
me
is
quite
clear
i
can
answer
this
right
sew
on
the
buttons
and
sew
them
on
tight
i
suspect
that
is
amy
said
esther
she
such
a
model
for
mending
and
keeping
things
in
order
it
not
fair
guessing
aloud
in
this
way
said
sally
alsop
sally
always
spoke
for
amy
and
amy
for
sally
voice
and
echo
rose
called
them
only
as
she
remarked
nobody
could
tell
which
was
echo
and
which
voice
the
next
word
was
nipson
and
the
question
do
you
like
flowers
do
i
like
flowers
i
will
not
write
a
sonnet
singing
their
beauty
as
a
poet
might
do
i
just
detest
those
on
aunt
nipson
bonnet
because
they
are
like
her
all
gray
and
blue
dusty
and
pinched
and
fastened
on
askew
and
as
for
heaven
own
buttercups
and
daisies
i
am
not
good
enough
to
sing
their
praises
nobody
knew
who
wrote
this
verse
katy
suspected
louisa
and
rose
suspected
katy
the
sixth
slip
was
a
very
brief
one
when
are
you
willing
if
i
was
willing
i
would
tell
you
but
when
oh
dear
i
what
an
extraordinary
rhyme
began
clover
but
rose
spied
poor
mary
blushing
and
looking
distressed
and
hastily
interposed
it
very
good
i
sure
i
wish
i
written
it
go
on
katy
so
katy
went
on
unfeeling
which
would
you
rather
do
or
go
fishing
i
do
feel
up
to
fishing
or
such
and
so
if
you
please
i
rather
do
which
i
do
seem
to
see
the
word
in
that
poem
said
rose
the
distinguished
author
will
please
write
another
the
distinguished
author
made
no
reply
to
this
suggestion
but
after
a
minute
or
two
esther
dearborn
quite
disinterestedly
as
she
stated
remarked
that
after
all
to
do
feel
was
pretty
much
the
same
as
unfeeling
there
was
a
little
chorus
of
groans
at
this
and
katy
said
she
should
certainly
impose
a
fine
if
such
dodges
and
evasions
were
practised
again
this
was
the
first
meeting
however
and
she
would
be
merciful
after
this
speech
she
unfolded
another
paper
it
ran
flea
what
would
you
do
love
what
would
i
do
love
well
i
do
not
know
how
can
i
tell
till
you
are
more
explicit
if
a
rose
you
held
me
i
would
smell
it
if
a
mouth
you
held
me
i
would
kiss
it
if
a
frog
i
scream
than
furies
if
a
flea
i
fetch
the
lyons
powder
only
two
slips
remained
one
was
katy
own
she
knew
it
by
the
way
in
which
it
was
folded
and
had
almost
instinctively
avoided
and
left
it
for
the
last
now
however
she
took
courage
and
opened
it
the
word
was
measles
and
the
question
who
was
the
grandmother
of
invention
these
were
the
lines
the
night
was
horribly
dark
the
measles
broke
out
in
the
ark
little
japher
and
shem
and
all
the
young
hams
were
screaming
at
once
for
potatoes
and
clams
and
what
shall
i
do
said
poor
noah
all
alone
by
myself
in
this
terrible
shower
i
know
what
i
do
i
step
down
in
the
hold
and
wake
up
a
lioness
grim
and
old
and
tie
her
close
to
the
children
door
and
giver
her
a
to
roar
at
the
top
of
her
voice
for
an
hour
or
more
and
i
tell
the
children
to
cease
their
din
or
i
let
that
grim
old
party
in
to
stop
their
squeazles
and
likewise
their
measles
she
practised
this
with
the
greatest
success
she
was
every
one
grandmother
i
guess
that
much
the
best
of
all
pronounced
alice
gibbons
i
wonder
who
wrote
it
dear
me
did
you
like
it
so
much
said
rose
simpering
and
doing
her
best
to
blush
did
you
really
write
it
said
mary
but
louisa
laughed
and
exclaimed
no
use
rosy
you
ca
take
us
in
we
know
better
now
for
the
last
said
katy
the
word
is
and
the
question
is
the
origin
of
dreams
when
the
nuns
are
sweetly
sleeping
nipson
comes
creeping
like
a
from
door
to
door
and
she
listens
to
their
slumbers
and
most
carefully
she
numbers
counting
for
every
nun
a
nunlet
snore
and
the
nuns
in
sweet
forgetfulness
who
lie
dreaming
of
buckwheat
cakes
parental
love
and
pie
moan
softly
twist
and
turn
and
see
black
cats
and
fiends
who
frolic
in
their
glee
and
nightmares
prancing
wildly
do
abound
while
nipson
makes
her
nightly
round
who
did
write
that
exclaimed
rose
nobody
answered
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
and
rose
scrutinized
them
all
with
sharp
glances
well
i
never
saw
such
creatures
for
keeping
their
countenances
she
said
somebody
is
as
bold
as
brass
did
you
see
how
i
blushed
when
my
piece
was
read
you
monkey
whispered
clover
who
at
that
moment
caught
sight
of
the
handwriting
on
the
paper
rose
gave
her
a
warning
pinch
and
the
both
subsided
into
an
unseen
giggle
what
the
cried
everybody
we
wanted
to
play
another
game
it
a
complete
success
whispered
rose
ecstatically
as
they
went
down
the
hall
the
girls
all
say
they
never
had
such
a
good
time
in
their
lives
i
so
glad
i
did
die
with
the
measles
when
i
was
little
well
demanded
lilly
so
the
high
and
mighty
society
has
had
a
meeting
how
did
it
go
off
replied
rose
smacking
her
lips
as
at
the
recollection
of
something
very
nice
but
you
must
ask
any
questions
lilly
outsiders
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
our
proceedings
are
strictly
private
she
ran
downstairs
with
katy
i
think
you
real
mean
called
lilly
after
them
then
she
said
to
herself
they
just
trying
to
tease
i
know
it
was
stupid
chapter
vii
injustice
summer
was
always
slow
in
getting
to
hillsover
but
at
last
she
arrived
and
woods
and
hills
suddenly
put
on
new
colors
and
became
beautiful
the
sober
village
shared
in
the
glorifying
process
vines
budded
on
piazzas
wistaria
purpled
walls
the
brown
elm
boughs
which
hung
above
the
common
turned
into
trailing
garlands
of
fresh
green
each
walk
revealed
some
change
or
ended
in
some
delightful
discovery
trilliums
violets
trees
in
blossom
or
wild
strawberries
turning
red
the
wood
flowers
and
mosses
even
the
birds
and
were
new
to
our
western
girls
hillsover
in
summer
was
a
great
deal
prettier
than
burnet
and
katy
and
clover
began
to
enjoy
school
very
much
indeed
toward
the
end
of
june
however
something
took
place
which
gave
them
quite
a
different
feeling
something
so
disagreeable
that
i
hate
to
tell
about
it
but
as
it
really
happened
i
must
it
was
on
a
saturday
morning
they
had
just
come
upstairs
laughing
and
feeling
very
merry
for
clover
had
written
a
droll
piece
for
the
meeting
and
was
telling
katy
about
it
when
just
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
they
met
rose
red
she
was
evidently
in
trouble
for
she
looked
flushed
and
excited
and
was
under
escort
of
miss
barnes
who
marched
before
her
with
the
air
of
a
policeman
as
she
passed
the
girls
rose
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
and
made
a
face
expressive
of
dismay
what
the
matter
whispered
clover
rose
only
made
another
grimace
clawed
with
her
fingers
at
miss
barnes
back
and
vanished
down
the
entry
which
led
to
florence
room
they
stood
looking
after
her
oh
dear
sighed
clover
i
so
afraid
rose
is
in
a
scrape
they
walked
on
toward
quaker
row
in
the
was
a
knot
of
girls
with
their
heads
close
together
whispering
when
they
saw
katy
and
clover
they
became
silent
and
gazed
at
them
curiously
what
has
rose
red
gone
to
florence
about
asked
clover
too
anxious
to
notice
the
strange
manner
of
the
girls
but
at
that
moment
she
caught
sight
of
something
which
so
amazed
her
that
she
forgot
her
question
it
was
nothing
less
than
her
own
trunk
with
at
the
end
being
carried
along
the
entry
by
two
men
miss
jane
followed
close
behind
with
her
arms
full
of
clothes
and
books
katy
know
scarlet
topped
the
pile
in
miss
jane
hand
were
clover
comb
and
brush
why
what
does
this
mean
gasped
clover
as
she
and
katy
darted
after
miss
jane
who
had
turned
into
one
of
the
rooms
it
was
no
at
the
head
of
the
row
a
room
which
no
one
had
wanted
on
account
of
its
smallness
and
lack
of
light
the
window
looked
out
on
a
brick
wall
not
ten
feet
away
there
was
never
a
ray
of
sun
to
make
it
cheerful
and
nipson
had
converted
it
into
a
for
empty
trunks
the
trunks
were
taken
away
now
and
the
bed
was
strewn
with
and
clovers
possessions
miss
jane
what
is
the
matter
what
are
you
moving
our
things
for
exclaimed
the
girls
in
great
excitement
miss
jane
laid
down
her
load
of
dress
and
looked
them
sternly
you
know
the
reason
as
well
as
i
do
she
said
icily
no
i
do
i
have
the
least
idea
what
you
mean
cried
katy
oh
please
be
careful
as
miss
jane
flung
a
pair
of
boots
on
top
of
cousin
helen
vase
you
break
it
dear
dear
clover
your
cologne
bottle
tipped
over
and
all
the
cologne
spilt
what
does
it
mean
is
our
room
going
to
be
painted
or
what
your
room
responded
miss
jane
is
for
the
future
to
be
this
no
miss
benson
and
miss
james
will
take
no
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
will
conduct
themselves
more
properly
than
you
have
done
than
we
have
done
cried
katy
hardly
believing
her
ears
do
not
repeat
my
words
in
that
rude
way
said
miss
jane
tartly
yes
than
you
have
done
but
what
have
we
done
there
is
some
dreadful
mistake
do
tell
us
what
you
mean
miss
jane
we
have
done
nothing
wrong
so
far
as
i
know
indeed
replied
miss
jane
sarcastically
your
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
must
be
peculiar
i
advise
you
to
say
no
more
on
the
subject
but
be
thankful
that
florence
keeps
you
in
the
school
at
all
instead
of
dismissing
you
nothing
but
the
fact
that
your
home
is
at
such
a
distance
prevents
her
from
doing
so
katy
felt
as
if
all
the
blood
in
her
body
were
turned
to
fire
as
she
heard
these
words
and
met
miss
jane
eyes
her
old
hasty
temper
which
had
seemed
to
die
out
during
years
of
pain
and
patience
flashed
into
sudden
life
as
a
smouldering
coal
flashes
when
you
least
expect
it
into
flame
she
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
gave
miss
jane
a
look
of
scorching
indignation
and
with
a
rapid
impulse
darted
out
of
the
room
and
along
the
hall
towards
florence
door
the
girls
she
met
scattered
from
her
path
right
and
left
she
looked
so
tall
and
moved
so
impetuously
that
she
absolutely
frightened
them
come
in
said
florence
in
answer
to
her
sharp
quivering
knock
katy
entered
rose
was
not
there
and
florence
and
nipson
sat
together
side
by
side
in
close
consultation
florence
said
katy
too
much
excited
to
feel
in
the
least
afraid
will
you
please
tell
me
why
our
things
are
being
changed
to
no
florence
flushed
with
anger
she
looked
katy
all
over
for
a
minute
before
she
answered
then
she
said
in
a
sever
voice
it
is
done
by
my
orders
and
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
what
those
reasons
are
you
know
as
well
as
i
no
i
do
replied
katy
as
angry
as
florence
i
the
least
idea
what
they
are
and
i
insist
on
knowing
i
can
not
answer
questions
put
in
such
an
improper
manner
said
florence
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
which
meant
that
katy
was
to
go
but
katy
did
not
stir
i
am
sorry
if
my
manner
was
improper
she
said
trying
to
speak
quietly
but
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
ask
what
this
means
if
we
are
accused
of
doing
wrong
it
is
only
fair
to
tell
us
what
it
is
florence
only
waved
her
hand
again
but
nipson
who
had
been
twisting
uneasily
in
her
chair
said
excuse
me
florence
but
perhaps
it
would
better
would
satisfy
miss
carr
better
if
you
were
to
be
explicit
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
miss
carr
can
be
in
need
of
any
explanation
replied
florence
when
a
young
lady
writes
underhand
notes
to
young
gentlemen
and
throws
them
from
her
window
and
they
are
discovered
she
must
naturally
expect
that
persons
of
correct
ideas
will
be
shocked
and
disgusted
your
note
to
abernathy
searles
miss
carr
was
found
by
his
mother
while
mending
his
pocket
and
was
handed
by
her
to
me
after
this
statement
you
will
hardly
be
surprised
that
i
do
not
consider
it
best
to
permit
you
to
room
longer
on
that
side
of
the
house
i
did
not
suppose
i
had
a
girl
in
my
school
capable
of
such
conduct
for
a
moment
katy
was
too
much
stunned
to
speak
she
took
hold
of
a
chair
to
steady
herself
and
her
color
changed
so
quickly
from
red
to
pale
and
back
again
to
red
that
florence
and
nipson
who
sat
watching
her
might
be
pardoned
for
thinking
that
she
looked
guilty
as
soon
as
she
recovered
her
voice
she
stammered
out
but
i
did
i
never
did
i
have
written
any
note
i
would
for
the
world
oh
florence
please
believe
me
i
prefer
to
believe
the
evidence
of
my
eyes
replied
florence
as
she
drew
a
paper
from
her
pocket
here
is
the
note
i
suppose
you
will
hardly
deny
your
own
signature
katy
seized
the
note
it
was
written
in
a
round
unformed
hand
and
ran
thus
dear
berry
i
saw
you
last
night
on
the
green
i
think
you
are
splendid
all
the
nuns
think
so
i
look
at
you
very
often
out
of
my
window
if
i
let
down
a
string
would
you
tie
a
cake
to
it
like
that
kind
which
you
threw
to
mary
andrews
last
term
tie
two
cakes
please
one
for
me
and
one
for
my
the
string
will
be
at
the
end
of
the
row
miss
carr
in
spite
of
her
agitation
katy
could
hardly
keep
back
a
smile
as
she
read
this
absurd
production
florence
saw
the
smile
and
her
tone
was
more
severe
than
ever
as
she
said
give
that
back
to
me
if
you
please
it
will
be
my
justification
with
your
father
if
he
objects
to
your
change
of
room
but
florence
cried
katy
i
never
wrote
that
note
it
my
handwriting
it
is
my
oh
surely
you
ca
think
so
too
ridiculous
go
to
your
room
at
once
said
florence
and
be
thankful
that
your
punishment
is
such
a
mild
one
if
your
home
were
not
so
distant
i
should
write
to
ask
your
father
to
remove
you
from
the
school
instead
of
which
i
merely
put
you
on
the
other
side
of
the
entry
out
of
reach
of
farther
correspondence
of
this
sort
but
shall
write
him
and
he
will
take
us
away
immediately
cried
katy
stung
to
the
quick
by
this
obstinate
injustice
i
will
not
stay
neither
shall
clover
where
our
word
is
disbelieved
and
we
are
treated
like
this
papa
knows
papa
will
never
doubt
us
a
moment
when
we
tell
him
that
this
is
true
with
these
passionate
words
she
left
the
room
i
do
not
think
that
either
florence
or
nipson
felt
very
comfortable
after
she
was
gone
that
was
a
dreadful
afternoon
the
girls
had
no
heart
to
arrange
no
or
do
any
thing
toward
making
it
comfortable
but
lay
on
the
bed
in
the
midst
of
their
belongings
crying
and
receiving
visits
of
condolence
from
their
friends
the
meeting
was
put
off
katy
was
in
no
humor
to
act
as
president
or
clover
to
read
her
funny
poem
rose
and
mary
silver
sat
by
kissing
them
at
intervals
and
declaring
that
it
was
a
shame
while
the
other
members
dropped
in
one
by
one
to
the
same
sentiments
if
it
had
been
anybody
else
said
alice
gibbons
but
katy
of
all
persons
it
is
too
much
so
i
told
florence
sobbed
rose
red
oh
why
was
i
born
so
bad
if
i
always
been
good
and
a
model
to
the
rest
of
you
perhaps
she
have
believed
me
instead
of
scolding
harder
than
ever
the
idea
of
rose
as
a
model
made
clover
smile
in
the
midst
of
her
dolefulness
it
an
outrageous
thing
said
ellen
gray
if
florence
only
knew
it
you
two
have
done
more
to
keep
the
rest
of
us
steady
than
any
girls
in
school
so
they
have
blubbered
rose
whose
pretty
face
was
quite
swollen
with
crying
i
been
getting
better
and
better
every
day
since
they
came
she
put
her
arms
round
clover
as
she
spoke
and
sobbed
harder
than
ever
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
excitement
that
miss
jane
saw
fit
to
come
in
and
inspect
the
room
when
she
saw
the
crying
girls
and
the
general
confusion
of
every
thing
she
was
very
angry
i
shall
mark
you
both
for
disorder
she
said
get
off
the
bed
miss
carr
hang
your
dresses
up
at
once
clover
and
put
your
shoes
in
the
i
never
saw
any
thing
so
disgraceful
all
these
things
must
be
in
order
when
i
return
fifteen
minutes
from
now
or
i
shall
report
you
to
mrs
florence
it
of
no
consequence
what
you
do
we
are
not
going
to
stay
muttered
katy
but
soon
she
was
ashamed
of
having
said
this
her
anger
was
melting
and
grief
taking
its
place
oh
papa
papa
elsie
elsie
she
whispered
to
herself
as
she
slowly
hung
up
the
dresses
and
unseen
by
the
girls
she
hid
her
face
in
the
folds
of
clover
gray
alpaca
and
shed
some
hot
tears
till
then
she
had
been
too
angry
to
cry
this
softer
mood
followed
her
all
through
the
evening
clover
and
rose
sat
by
talking
over
the
affair
and
keeping
their
wrath
warm
with
discussion
katy
said
hardly
a
word
she
felt
too
weary
and
depressed
to
speak
who
could
have
written
the
note
asked
clover
again
and
again
it
was
impossible
to
guess
it
seemed
absurd
to
suspect
any
of
the
older
girls
but
then
as
rose
suggested
the
absurdity
as
well
as
the
signature
might
have
been
imitated
to
avoid
detection
i
know
one
thing
remarked
rose
and
that
is
that
i
should
like
to
kill
searles
horrid
old
thing
peeping
and
prying
into
pockets
she
has
no
business
to
be
alive
at
all
rose
ferocious
speeches
always
sounded
specially
comical
when
taken
in
connection
with
her
pink
cheeks
and
her
dimples
shall
you
write
to
papa
katy
asked
clover
katy
shook
her
head
she
was
too
to
talk
big
tears
rolled
down
unseen
and
fell
upon
the
pillow
after
rose
was
gone
and
the
candle
out
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
waking
early
in
the
dim
dawn
she
lay
and
thought
it
over
clover
slumbering
soundly
beside
her
meanwhile
morning
brings
counsel
says
the
old
proverb
in
this
case
it
seemed
true
katy
to
her
surprise
found
a
train
of
fresh
thoughts
filling
her
mind
which
were
not
there
when
she
fell
asleep
she
recalled
her
passionate
words
and
feelings
of
the
day
before
now
that
the
mood
had
passed
they
seemed
to
her
worse
than
the
injury
which
provoked
them
tempered
and
generous
people
often
experience
this
it
was
easier
for
katy
to
forgive
florence
because
it
was
needful
also
that
she
should
forgive
herself
i
said
i
would
write
to
papa
to
take
us
away
she
thought
why
did
i
say
that
what
good
would
it
do
it
would
make
anybody
disbelieve
this
hateful
story
they
only
think
i
wanted
to
get
away
because
i
was
found
out
and
papa
would
be
so
worried
and
disappointed
it
has
cost
him
a
great
deal
to
get
us
ready
and
send
us
here
and
he
wants
us
to
stay
a
year
if
we
went
home
now
all
the
money
would
be
wasted
and
yet
how
horrid
it
is
going
to
be
after
this
i
do
feel
as
if
i
could
ever
bear
to
see
florence
again
i
must
write
but
then
her
thoughts
flowed
on
home
would
seem
like
home
if
we
went
away
from
school
in
disgrace
and
knew
that
everybody
here
was
believing
such
things
suppose
instead
i
were
to
write
to
papa
to
come
on
and
make
things
straight
he
find
out
the
truth
and
force
florence
to
see
it
it
would
be
very
expensive
though
and
i
know
he
ought
to
leave
home
again
so
soon
oh
dear
how
hard
it
is
to
know
what
to
do
what
would
cousin
helen
say
she
continued
going
in
imagination
to
the
of
the
dear
friend
who
was
to
her
like
a
second
conscience
she
shut
her
eyes
and
invented
a
long
talk
her
questions
cousin
helen
replies
but
as
everybody
knows
it
is
impossible
to
play
croquet
by
yourself
and
be
strictly
impartial
to
all
the
four
balls
katy
found
that
she
was
making
cousin
helen
play
that
is
answer
as
she
herself
wished
and
not
as
something
whispered
she
would
answer
were
she
really
there
it
is
just
the
scholar
over
again
she
said
half
aloud
i
ca
see
i
do
know
how
to
act
she
remembered
the
dream
she
once
had
of
a
great
beautiful
face
and
a
helping
hand
and
it
was
real
she
murmured
and
just
as
real
and
just
as
near
now
as
then
the
result
of
this
long
meditation
was
that
when
clover
woke
up
she
found
katy
leaning
over
ready
to
kiss
her
for
good
morning
and
looking
bright
and
determined
clovy
she
said
i
been
thinking
and
i
not
going
to
write
to
papa
about
this
affair
at
all
are
you
why
not
asked
clover
puzzled
because
it
would
worry
him
and
be
of
no
use
he
would
come
on
and
take
us
right
away
i
sure
but
florence
and
all
the
teachers
and
a
great
many
of
the
girls
would
always
believe
that
this
horrid
ridiculous
story
is
true
i
ca
bear
to
have
them
let
stay
instead
and
convince
them
that
it
is
i
think
we
can
i
would
a
great
deal
rather
go
home
said
clover
it
wo
ever
be
nice
here
again
we
shall
have
this
dark
room
and
miss
jane
will
be
more
unkind
than
ever
and
the
girls
will
think
you
wrote
that
note
and
lilly
page
will
say
hateful
things
she
buttoned
her
boots
with
a
vindictive
air
never
mind
said
katy
trying
to
feel
brave
i
do
suppose
it
will
be
pleasant
but
i
pretty
sure
it
right
and
rosy
and
all
the
girls
we
really
care
for
know
how
it
is
i
ca
bear
it
sighed
clover
with
tears
in
her
eyes
it
is
so
cruel
that
they
should
say
such
things
about
you
i
mean
that
they
shall
say
something
quite
different
before
we
go
away
replied
katy
stroking
her
hair
cousin
helen
would
tell
us
to
stay
i
pretty
sure
i
was
thinking
about
her
just
now
and
i
seemed
to
hear
her
voice
in
the
air
saying
over
and
over
it
down
live
it
down
live
it
down
she
half
sang
this
and
took
two
or
three
dancing
steps
across
the
room
what
a
girl
you
are
said
clover
consoled
by
seeing
katy
look
so
bright
florence
was
surprised
that
morning
as
she
sat
in
her
room
by
the
appearance
of
katy
she
looked
pale
but
perfectly
quiet
and
gentle
florence
she
said
i
come
to
say
that
i
shall
not
write
to
my
father
to
take
us
away
as
i
told
you
i
should
florence
bowed
stiffly
by
way
of
answer
not
went
on
katy
with
a
little
flash
in
her
eyes
that
he
would
hesitate
or
doubt
my
word
one
moment
if
i
did
but
he
wished
us
to
stay
here
a
year
and
i
do
want
to
disappoint
him
i
rather
stay
and
florence
i
sorry
i
was
angry
and
felt
that
you
were
unjust
and
you
own
that
i
was
not
oh
no
replied
katy
i
ca
do
that
you
unjust
because
neither
clover
nor
i
wrote
that
note
we
would
do
such
a
horrid
thing
for
the
world
and
i
hope
some
day
you
will
believe
us
but
i
ought
to
have
spoken
so
katy
face
and
voice
were
so
truthful
as
she
said
this
that
florence
was
almost
shaken
in
her
opinion
we
will
say
no
more
about
the
matter
she
remarked
in
a
kinder
tone
if
your
conduct
is
perfectly
correct
in
future
it
will
go
far
to
make
this
forgotten
few
things
are
more
aggravating
than
to
be
forgiven
when
one
has
done
no
wrong
katy
felt
this
as
she
walked
away
from
room
but
she
would
not
let
herself
grow
angry
again
live
it
down
she
whispered
as
she
went
into
the
she
and
clover
had
a
good
deal
to
endure
for
the
next
two
or
three
weeks
they
missed
their
old
room
with
its
sunny
window
and
pleasant
outlook
they
missed
rose
who
down
at
the
far
end
of
quaker
row
could
not
drop
in
half
so
often
as
had
been
her
custom
miss
jane
was
specially
grim
and
sharp
and
some
of
the
upstairs
girls
who
resented
katy
plain
speaking
and
the
formation
of
a
society
against
flirting
improved
the
chance
to
be
provoking
lilly
page
was
one
of
these
she
did
really
believe
katy
guilty
but
she
liked
to
tease
her
by
pretending
to
believe
it
only
to
think
of
the
president
of
the
saintly
society
being
caught
like
this
she
remarked
maliciously
what
are
our
great
reformers
coming
to
now
if
it
had
been
a
sinner
like
me
no
one
would
be
surprised
all
this
naturally
was
vexatious
even
sunny
clover
shed
many
tears
in
private
over
her
mortifications
but
the
girls
bore
their
trouble
bravely
and
never
said
one
syllable
about
the
matter
in
the
letters
home
there
were
consolations
too
mixed
with
the
annoyances
rose
red
clung
to
her
two
friends
closely
and
loyally
fought
their
battles
the
to
a
girl
rallied
round
its
chief
after
that
sad
saturday
the
meetings
were
resumed
with
as
much
spirit
as
ever
katy
steadiness
and
uniform
politeness
and
sweet
temper
impressed
even
those
who
would
have
been
glad
to
believe
a
tale
against
her
and
in
short
time
the
affair
ceased
to
be
a
subject
for
discussion
was
almost
forgotten
in
fact
except
for
a
sore
spot
in
katy
heart
and
one
page
in
rose
red
album
upon
which
under
the
date
of
that
fatal
day
were
written
these
words
headed
by
an
appalling
skull

changes
clover
where
clover
cried
rose
red
popping
her
head
into
the
schoolroom
where
katy
sat
writing
her
composition
oh
katy
there
you
are
i
want
you
too
come
down
to
my
room
right
away
i
such
a
thing
to
tell
you
what
is
it
tell
me
too
said
bella
arkwright
bella
was
a
veritable
little
pitcher
of
the
kind
mentioned
in
the
proverb
and
had
an
insatiable
curiosity
to
know
every
thing
that
other
people
knew
tell
you
miss
i
should
really
like
to
know
why

you
think
a
great
lady
and
can
have
secrets
but
you
ai
a
little
girl
too
most
as
little
as
me
so
there
rose
made
a
face
at
her
and
a
sort
of
growling
rush
which
had
the
effect
of
sending
bella
screaming
down
the
hall
then
returning
to
the
do
come
katy
she
said
find
clover
and
hurry
really
and
truly
i
want
you
i
feel
as
if
i
should
burst
if
i
do
tell
somebody
right
away
what
i
found
out
katy
began
to
be
curious
she
went
in
pursuit
of
clover
who
was
practising
in
one
of
the
and
the
three
girls
ran
together
down
quaker
row
now
said
rose
locking
the
door
and
pushing
forward
a
chair
for
katy
and
another
for
clover
swear
that
you
wo
tell
for
this
is
a
real
secret
the
greatest
secret
that
ever
was
and
florence
would
flay
me
alive
if
she
knew
that
i
knew
she
paused
to
enjoy
the
effect
of
her
words
and
suddenly
began
to
snuff
the
air
in
a
peculiar
manner
girls
she
said
solemnly
that
little
wretch
of
a
bella
is
in
this
room
i
am
sure
of
it
what
makes
you
think
so
cried
the
others
supervised
i
smell
that
dreadful
pomatum
that
she
puts
on
her
hair
do
you
notice
it
she
hidden
somewhere
rose
looked
sharply
about
for
a
minute
then
made
a
pounce
and
from
under
the
bed
dragged
a
small
kicking
heap
it
was
the
guilty
bella
what
were
you
doing
there
you
bad
child
demanded
rose
seizing
the
kicking
feet
and
holding
them
fast
i
do
care
blubbered
bella
you
would
tell
me
your
secret
you
a
real
horrid
girl
rose
red
i
do
love
you
a
bit
your
affection
is
not
a
thing
which
i
particularly
pine
for
retorted
rose
seating
herself
and
holding
the
culprit
before
her
by
the
ends
of
her
short
i
do
want
little
girls
who
peep
and
hide
to
love
me
i
rather
they
would
now
listen
do
you
know
what
i
shall
do
if
you
ever
come
again
into
my
room
without
leave
first
i
shall
cut
off
your
hair
pomatum
and
all
with
my
penknife
bella
screamed
and
then
i
turn
myself
into
a
bear
a
great
brown
bear
and
eat
you
up
rose
pronounced
this
threat
with
tremendous
energy
and
accompanied
it
with
a
snarl
which
showed
all
her
teeth
bella
roared
with
fright
twitched
away
her
unlocked
the
door
and
fled
rose
not
pursuing
but
sitting
comfortably
in
her
chair
and
growling
at
intervals
till
her
victim
was
out
of
hearing
then
she
rose
and
bolted
the
door
again
how
lucky
that
the
imp
is
so
fond
of
that
smelly
pomatum
she
remarked
one
always
knows
where
to
look
for
her
it
as
good
as
a
bell
round
her
neck
now
for
the
secret
you
promise
not
to
tell
well
then
florence
is
going
away
week
after
next
and
more
she
going
to
be
married
not
really
cried
the
others
really
and
truly
she
going
to
be
married
to
a
clergyman
how
did
you
find
out
why
it
the
most
curious
thing
you
know
my
blue
lawn
which
miss
james
is
making
this
morning
i
went
to
try
it
on
miss
barnes
with
me
of
course
and
while
miss
james
was
fitting
the
waist
seccomb
came
in
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
by
miss
barnes
they
began
to
talk
and
pretty
soon
seccomb
said
day
does
florence
go
week
said
miss
barnes
she
sort
of
mumbled
it
and
looked
to
see
if
i
were
listening
i
was
but
of
course
after
that
i
did
as
hard
as
i
could
where
does
the
important
event
take
place
asked
seccomb
she
so
funny
with
her
little
bit
of
a
mouth
and
her
long
words
she
always
looks
as
if
each
of
them
was
a
big
pill
and
she
wanted
to
swallow
it
and
could
lewisberg
at
her
sister
house
said
miss
barnes
she
mumbled
more
than
ever
but
i
heard
a
deplorable
loss
she
will
be
to
our
limited
circle
said
seccomb
i
could
imagine
what
they
meant
but
do
you
think
when
i
got
home
there
was
this
letter
from
sylvia
and
she
says
adored
florence
is
going
to
be
married
i
afraid
you
all
break
your
hearts
about
it
mother
met
the
gentleman
at
a
party
the
other
night
she
says
he
looks
clever
but
is
at
all
handsome
which
is
a
pity
for
florence
is
a
raving
beauty
in
my
opinion
he
an
excellent
preacher
we
hear
and
wo
she
manage
the
parish
to
perfection
how
shall
you
like
being
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
mrs
nipson
now
did
you
ever
hear
any
thing
so
droll
in
your
life
went
on
rose
folding
up
her
letter
just
think
of
those
two
things
coming
together
the
same
day
it
like
a
sum
in
arithmetic
with
an
answer
which
the
sum
is
it
rose
had
counted
on
producing
an
effect
and
she
certainly
was
not
disappointed
the
girls
could
think
and
talk
of
nothing
else
for
the
remainder
of
that
afternoon
it
was
a
singular
fact
that
before
two
days
were
over
every
scholar
in
the
school
knew
that
florence
was
going
to
be
married
how
the
secret
got
out
nobody
could
guess
rose
protested
that
it
was
her
fault
she
had
been
a
miracle
of
discretion
a
perfect
sphinx
but
there
was
a
guilty
laugh
in
her
eyes
and
katy
suspected
that
the
sphinx
had
unbent
a
little
nothing
so
exciting
had
ever
happened
at
the
nunnery
before
some
of
the
older
scholars
were
quite
inconsolable
they
bemoaned
themselves
and
got
together
in
corners
to
enjoy
the
luxury
of
woe
nothing
comforted
them
but
the
project
of
getting
up
a
testimonial
for
florence
what
this
testimonial
should
be
caused
great
discussion
in
the
school
everybody
had
a
different
idea
and
everybody
was
sure
that
her
idea
was
better
than
anybody
else
all
the
school
contributed
the
money
collected
amounted
to
nearly
forty
dollars
and
the
question
was
what
should
be
bought
every
sort
of
thing
was
proposed
lilly
page
insisted
that
nothing
could
possibly
be
so
appropriate
as
a
bouquet
of
wax
flowers
and
a
glass
shade
to
put
over
it
there
was
a
strong
party
in
favor
of
spoons
annie
silsbie
suggested
a
statue
somebody
else
a
clock
rose
red
was
for
a
cabinet
piano
and
katy
had
some
trouble
in
convincing
her
that
forty
dollars
would
not
buy
one
bella
demanded
that
they
should
get
an
organ
you
can
go
along
with
it
as
monkey
said
rose
which
remark
made
bella
caper
with
indignation
at
last
after
long
discussion
and
some
quarelling
a
was
fixed
upon
sylvia
redding
happened
to
be
making
a
visit
in
boston
and
rose
was
commissioned
to
write
and
ask
her
to
select
the
gift
and
send
it
up
by
express
the
girls
could
hardly
wait
till
it
came
i
do
hope
it
will
be
pretty
do
you
they
said
over
and
over
again
when
the
box
arrived
they
all
gathered
to
see
it
opened
esther
dearborn
took
out
the
nails
half
a
dozen
hands
lifted
the
lid
and
rose
unwrapped
the
tissue
paper
and
displayed
the
basket
up
to
general
view
oh
what
a
beauty
cried
everybody
it
was
woven
of
twisted
silver
wire
two
figures
of
children
with
wings
and
garlands
supported
the
handle
on
either
side
in
the
middle
of
the
handle
were
a
pair
of
silver
doves
billing
and
cooing
in
the
most
affectionate
way
over
a
tiny
shield
on
which
were
engraved
florence
initials
i
never
saw
one
like
it
does
it
look
heavy
cried
a
chorus
of
voices
as
rose
highly
gratified
held
up
the
basket
who
shall
present
it
asked
louisa
agnew
rose
red
said
some
of
the
girls
no
indeed
i
not
tall
enough
protested
rose
it
must
be
somebody
who
kind
of
sweep
into
the
room
and
be
impressive
i
vote
for
katy
oh
no
said
katy
shrinking
back
i
should
do
it
well
at
all
suppose
we
put
it
to
a
vote
ellen
gray
cut
some
slips
of
paper
and
each
girl
wrote
a
name
and
dropped
it
into
the
box
when
the
votes
were
counted
katy
name
appeared
on
all
but
three
i
propose
that
we
make
this
vote
unanimous
said
rose
highly
delighted
the
girls
agreed
and
rose
jumping
on
a
chair
exclaimed
three
cheers
for
katy
carr
keep
time
girls
one
two
hip
hip
hurrah
the
hurrahs
were
given
with
enthusiasm
for
katy
almost
without
knowing
it
had
become
popular
she
was
too
much
touched
and
pleased
to
speak
at
first
when
she
did
it
was
to
protest
against
her
election
esther
would
do
it
beautifully
she
said
and
i
think
florence
would
like
the
basket
better
if
she
gave
it
you
know
ever
since
she
stopped
even
now
she
could
not
refer
with
composure
to
the
affair
of
the
note
oh
cried
louisa
she
thinking
of
that
ridiculous
note
florence
made
such
a
fuss
about
as
if
anybody
supposed
you
wrote
it
katy
i
do
believe
even
miss
jane
is
such
a
goose
as
that
any
way
if
she
is
that
one
reason
more
why
you
should
present
the
basket
to
show
that
we
do
think
so
she
gave
katy
a
kiss
by
way
of
period
yes
indeed
you
chosen
and
you
must
give
it
cried
the
others
very
well
said
katy
extremely
gratified
what
am
i
to
say
we
compose
a
speech
for
you
replied
rose
sugar
your
voice
katy
and
whatever
you
do
stand
up
straight
do
crook
over
as
if
you
thought
you
were
tall
it
a
bad
trick
you
have
child
and
i
always
sorry
to
see
it
concluded
rose
with
the
air
of
a
wise
mamma
giving
a
lecture
it
is
droll
how
much
can
go
on
in
a
school
unseen
and
unsuspected
by
its
teachers
florence
never
dreamed
that
the
girls
had
guessed
her
secret
her
plan
was
to
go
away
as
if
for
a
visit
and
leave
nipson
to
explain
at
her
leisure
she
was
therefore
quite
unprepared
for
the
appearance
of
katy
holding
the
beautiful
basket
which
was
full
of
fresh
roses
crimson
white
and
pink
i
am
afraid
the
rules
of
the
had
been
slightly
relaxed
to
allow
of
rose
getting
these
flowers
certainly
they
grew
nowhere
in
hillsover
except
in
professor
seccomb
garden
the
girls
wanted
me
to
give
you
this
with
a
great
deal
of
love
from
us
all
said
katy
feeling
strangely
embarrassed
and
hardly
venturing
to
raise
her
eyes
she
set
the
basket
on
the
table
we
hope
that
you
will
be
happy
she
added
in
a
low
voice
and
moved
toward
the
door
florence
had
been
to
much
surprised
to
speak
but
now
she
called
wait
come
back
a
moment
katy
came
back
florence
cheeks
were
flushed
she
looked
very
handsome
katy
almost
thought
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
tell
the
girls
that
i
thank
them
very
much
their
present
is
beautiful
i
shall
always
value
it
she
blushed
as
she
spoke
and
katy
blushed
too
it
made
her
shy
to
see
the
usually
composed
florence
so
confused
what
did
she
say
what
did
she
say
demanded
the
others
who
were
collected
in
groups
round
the
door
to
hear
a
report
of
the
interview
katy
repeated
her
message
some
of
the
girls
were
disappointed
is
that
all
they
said
we
thought
she
would
stand
up
and
make
a
speech
or
a
short
poem
put
in
rose
red
a
few
stanzas
thrown
off
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
like
this
for
instance
thank
you
kindly
for
your
basket
which
i
did
mean
to
ask
it
but
i
very
gladly
take
it
and
when
is
full
of
cake
it
will
frequently
remind
me
of
the
girls
i
left
behind
me
there
was
a
universal
giggle
which
brought
miss
jane
out
of
the
order
she
said
ringing
the
bell
young
ladies
what
are
you
about
study
hour
has
begun
we
so
sorry
florence
is
going
away
said
some
of
the
girls
how
did
you
know
that
she
is
going
demanded
miss
jane
sharply
nobody
answered
next
day
florence
left
katy
saw
her
go
with
a
secret
regret
if
only
she
would
have
said
that
she
did
believe
i
wrote
that
note
she
told
clover
i
do
care
what
she
believes
she
a
stupid
unjust
woman
replied
independent
little
clover
nipson
was
now
in
sole
charge
of
the
establishment
she
had
never
tried
before
and
had
various
pet
plans
and
theories
of
her
own
which
she
had
only
been
waiting
for
florence
departure
to
put
into
practice
one
of
these
was
that
the
school
was
to
dine
three
times
a
week
on
pudding
and
bread
and
butter
nipson
had
a
theory
very
convenient
and
economical
for
herself
but
highly
distasteful
to
her
scholars
that
it
was
injurious
for
young
people
to
eat
meat
every
day
in
hot
weather
the
puddings
were
made
of
batter
with
a
sprinkling
of
blackberries
or
raisins
now
rising
at
six
and
studying
four
hours
and
a
half
on
a
light
breakfast
has
wonderful
effect
on
the
appetite
as
all
who
have
tried
it
will
testify
the
poor
girls
would
go
down
to
dinner
as
hungry
as
wolves
and
eye
the
large
pale
slices
on
their
plates
with
a
wrath
and
dismay
which
i
can
not
describe
very
thick
the
slices
were
and
there
was
plenty
of
thin
sugared
sauce
to
eat
with
them
and
plenty
of
bread
and
butter
but
somehow
the
whole
was
unsatisfying
and
the
hungry
girls
would
go
upstairs
almost
as
ravenous
as
when
they
came
down
the
were
always
hanging
over
the
balusters
to
receive
them
and
when
to
the
demand
what
did
you
have
for
dinner
pudding
was
answered
a
low
groan
would
run
from
one
to
another
and
a
general
gloom
seemed
to
drop
down
and
envelop
the
party
it
may
have
been
in
consequence
of
this
experience
of
starvation
that
the
orders
for
fourth
of
july
were
that
year
so
unusually
large
it
was
an
old
custom
in
the
school
that
the
girls
should
celebrate
the
national
independence
by
buying
as
many
goodies
as
they
liked
there
was
no
in
hillsover
so
nipson
took
the
orders
and
sent
to
boston
for
the
things
which
were
charged
on
the
bills
with
other
extras
under
these
blissful
circumstances
the
girls
felt
that
they
could
afford
to
be
extravagant
and
made
out
their
lists
regardless
of
expense
rose
red
for
this
fourth
ran
thus
two
pounds
of
chocolate
caramels
two
pounds
of
sugar
almonds
two
pounds
of
lemon
drops
two
pounds
of
mixed
candy
two
pounds
of
maccaroons
a
dozen
oranges
a
dozen
lemons
a
drum
of
figs
a
box
of
french
plums
a
loaf
of
almond
cake
the
result
of
this
liberal
order
was
that
after
the
great
of
parcels
had
been
distributed
and
the
school
had
rioted
for
four
hours
upon
these
unaccustomed
luxuries
rose
was
found
lying
on
her
bed
ghastly
and
pallid
never
speak
to
me
of
any
thing
sweet
again
so
long
as
i
live
she
gasped
talk
of
vinegar
or
pickles
or
sour
apples
but
allude
to
sugar
in
any
form
if
you
love
me
oh
why
why
did
i
send
for
those
fatal
things
in
time
all
the
candy
was
eaten
up
and
the
school
went
back
to
its
normal
condition
three
weeks
later
came
college
commencement
are
you
and
clover
craters
or
symposiums
demanded
lilly
page
meeting
katy
in
the
hall
a
few
days
before
this
important
event
what
do
you
mean
why
has
nobody
told
you
about
them
they
are
the
two
great
college
societies
all
the
girls
belong
to
one
or
the
other
and
make
the
wreaths
to
dress
their
halls
we
work
up
in
the
gymnasium
the
crater
girls
take
the
east
side
and
the
symposium
girls
the
west
and
when
the
wreaths
grow
too
long
we
hang
them
out
of
the
windows
it
the
greatest
fun
in
the
world
be
a
symposium
do
i
one
i
shall
have
to
think
about
it
before
deciding
said
katy
privately
resolving
to
join
rose
red
society
whichever
it
was
the
crater
it
proved
to
be
so
katy
and
clover
enrolled
themselves
with
the
craters
three
days
before
commencement
began
the
afternoons
were
wholly
given
up
to
the
work
and
instead
of
walking
or
piano
practice
the
girls
sat
plaiting
into
garlands
many
yards
long
baskets
of
fresh
leaves
were
constantly
brought
in
and
there
was
a
strife
between
the
rival
societies
as
to
which
should
accomplish
most
it
was
great
fun
as
lilly
had
said
to
sit
there
amid
the
green
boughs
and
pleasant
leafy
smells
a
buzz
of
gay
voices
in
the
air
and
a
general
sense
of
holiday
the
gymnasium
would
have
furnished
many
a
pretty
picture
for
an
artist
during
those
three
afternoons
only
unfortunately
no
artist
was
let
in
to
see
it
one
day
rose
red
emptying
a
basket
lighted
upon
a
white
parcel
hidden
beneath
the
leaves
lemon
drops
she
exclaimed
applying
finger
and
thumb
with
all
the
dexterity
of
jack
horner
here
crater
girls
here
something
for
you
do
you
pity
the
symposiums
but
next
day
a
big
package
of
peppermints
appeared
in
the
symposium
basket
so
neither
society
could
boast
advantage
over
the
other
they
were
pretty
nearly
equal
too
in
the
quantity
of
wreath
made
the
craters
measuring
nine
hundred
yards
and
the
symposiums
nine
hundred
and
two
as
for
the
halls
which
they
were
taken
over
to
see
the
evening
before
commencement
it
was
impossible
to
say
which
was
most
beautifully
trimmed
each
faction
preferred
its
own
and
president
searles
said
that
both
did
the
young
ladies
credit
they
all
sat
in
the
gallery
of
the
church
on
commencement
day
and
heard
the
speeches
it
was
very
hot
and
the
speeches
were
not
exactly
interesting
being
on
such
subjects
as
the
influence
of
a
republic
on
men
of
letters
and
the
abstract
law
of
justice
as
applied
to
human
affairs
but
the
music
and
the
crowd
and
the
spectacle
of
six
hundred
ladies
all
fanning
themselves
at
once
were
entertaining
and
the
girls
would
not
have
missed
them
for
the
world
later
in
the
day
another
diversion
was
afforded
them
by
the
throngs
of
pink
and
blue
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
passed
the
house
on
their
way
to
the
president
levee
but
they
were
not
allowed
to
enjoy
this
amusement
long
for
miss
jane
suspecting
what
was
going
on
went
from
room
to
room
and
ordered
everybody
summarily
off
to
bed
with
the
close
of
commencement
day
a
deep
sleep
seemed
to
settle
over
hillsover
most
of
the
professors
families
went
off
to
enjoy
themselves
at
the
mountains
or
the
leaving
their
houses
shut
up
this
gave
the
village
a
drowsy
and
deserted
air
there
were
no
boys
playing
balls
on
the
common
or
swinging
on
the
college
fence
no
look
of
life
in
the
streets
the
weather
continued
warm
the
routine
of
study
and
excercise
grew
dull
and
teachers
and
scholars
alike
were
glad
when
the
middle
of
september
arrived
and
with
it
the
opening
of
the
autumn
vacation
chapter
ix
the
autumn
vacation
the
last
day
of
the
term
was
one
of
confusion
every
part
of
the
house
was
given
over
to
trunks
and
packing
nipson
sat
at
her
desk
making
out
bills
and
listening
to
requests
about
rooms
and
miss
jane
counted
books
and
atlases
taking
note
of
each
and
page
the
girls
ran
about
searching
for
missing
articles
deciding
what
to
take
home
and
what
to
leave
engaging
each
other
for
the
winter
walks
all
rules
were
laid
aside
the
sober
nunnery
seemed
turned
into
a
hive
of
buzzing
bees
bella
slid
twice
down
the
baluster
of
the
front
stairs
without
being
reproved
and
rose
red
threw
her
arm
round
katy
waist
and
waltzed
the
whole
length
of
quaker
row
i
so
happy
that
i
should
like
to
scream
she
announced
as
their
last
whirl
brought
them
up
against
the
wall
is
vacation
just
lovely
katy
you
do
look
half
glad
we
not
going
home
you
know
replied
katy
in
rather
a
doleful
tone
she
and
clover
were
not
so
enraptured
at
the
coming
of
vacation
as
the
rest
of
the
girls
spending
a
month
with
mrs
page
and
lilly
was
by
no
means
the
same
thing
as
spending
it
with
papa
and
the
children
next
morning
however
when
the
big
stage
drove
up
and
the
girls
crowded
in
when
nipson
stood
in
the
blandly
waving
farewell
and
the
maids
flourished
their
dusters
out
of
the
upper
windows
they
found
themselves
sharing
the
general
excitement
and
joining
heartily
in
the
cheer
which
arose
as
the
stage
moved
away
the
girls
felt
so
happy
and
that
some
of
them
even
kissed
their
hands
to
miss
jane
such
a
wild
company
is
not
often
met
with
on
a
railroad
train
they
all
went
together
as
far
as
the
junction
and
gray
ellen
father
who
had
been
put
in
charge
of
the
party
by
nipson
had
his
hands
full
to
keep
them
in
any
sort
of
order
he
was
a
timid
old
gentleman
and
as
rose
suggested
his
expression
resembled
that
of
a
sedate
hen
who
suddenly
finds
herself
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
a
brood
of
ducklings
my
dear
my
dear
he
feebly
remonstrated
would
you
buy
any
more
candy
do
you
not
think
so
many
may
be
bad
for
you
oh
no
sir
replied
rose
they
never
hurt
me
a
bit
i
can
eat
thousands
then
as
a
stout
lady
entered
the
car
and
made
a
motion
toward
the
vacant
seat
beside
her
she
rolled
her
eyes
wildly
and
said
excuse
me
but
perhaps
i
had
better
take
the
end
seat
so
as
to
get
out
easily
in
case
i
have
a
fit
fits
cried
the
stout
lady
and
walked
away
with
the
utmost
dispatch
rose
gave
a
wicked
chuckle
the
girls
tittered
and
gray
visibly
trembled
is
she
really
afflicted
in
this
way
he
whispered
oh
no
papa
it
only
rose
nonsense
apologized
ellen
who
was
laughing
as
hard
as
the
rest
but
gray
did
not
feel
comfortable
and
he
was
very
glad
when
they
reached
the
junction
and
half
of
his
troublesome
charge
departed
on
the
branch
road
at
six
they
arrived
in
springfield
half
a
dozen
papas
were
waiting
for
their
daughters
trains
stood
ready
there
was
a
clamor
of
mr
page
was
absorbed
by
lilly
who
kissed
him
incessantly
and
chattered
so
fast
that
he
had
no
eyes
for
any
one
else
louisa
was
borne
away
by
an
uncle
with
whom
she
was
to
pass
the
night
and
katy
and
clover
found
themselves
left
alone
they
did
not
like
to
interrupt
lilly
so
they
retreated
to
a
bench
and
sat
down
feeling
rather
and
and
though
they
did
not
say
so
i
am
sure
that
each
was
thinking
about
papa
it
was
only
for
a
moment
mr
page
spied
them
and
came
up
with
such
a
kind
greeting
that
the
forlorn
feeling
fled
at
once
they
were
to
pass
the
night
at
the
massasoit
it
seemed
and
he
collected
their
bags
and
led
the
way
across
the
street
to
the
hotel
where
rooms
were
already
engaged
for
them
now
for
waffles
whispered
lilly
as
they
went
upstairs
and
when
after
a
few
minutes
of
washing
and
brushing
they
came
down
again
into
the
she
called
for
so
many
things
and
announced
herself
starved
in
such
a
tragical
tone
that
two
amused
waiters
at
once
flew
to
the
rescue
and
devoted
themselves
to
supplying
her
wants
waffle
after
waffle
each
hotter
and
crisper
than
the
last
did
those
men
produce
till
even
lilly
appetite
gave
out
and
she
was
forced
to
own
that
she
could
not
swallow
another
morsel
this
climax
reached
they
went
into
the
parlor
and
the
girls
sat
down
in
the
window
to
watch
the
people
in
the
street
which
after
quiet
hillsover
looked
as
brilliant
and
crowded
as
broadway
there
were
not
many
persons
in
the
parlor
a
couple
sat
at
a
table
at
some
distance
and
a
pretty
little
boy
in
a
velvet
jacket
was
playing
around
the
room
he
seemed
about
five
years
old
and
katy
who
was
fond
of
children
put
out
her
hand
as
he
went
by
caught
him
and
lifted
him
into
her
lap
he
did
not
seem
shy
but
looked
her
in
the
face
composedly
like
a
grown
person
what
is
your
name
dear
she
asked
daniel
sparks
answered
the
little
boy
his
voice
was
prim
and
distinct
do
you
live
at
this
hotel
yes
i
reside
here
with
my
father
and
mother
and
what
do
you
do
all
day
are
there
some
other
little
boys
for
you
to
play
with
i
do
not
wish
to
play
with
any
little
boys
replied
daniel
in
a
dignified
tone
i
prefer
to
be
with
my
parents
we
have
taken
a
walk
we
went
to
see
a
beautiful
conservatory
outside
the
city
there
is
a
victoria
regia
there
i
had
often
heard
of
this
wonderful
lily
and
in
the
last
number
of
the
london
there
is
a
picture
of
it
represented
with
a
small
negro
child
standing
upon
one
of
its
leaves
my
father
said
that
he
did
not
think
this
possible
but
when
we
saw
the
plant
we
perceived
that
the
print
was
not
an
exaggeration
such
is
the
size
of
the
leaf
that
a
small
negro
child
might
very
easily
supported
upon
it
oh
my
cried
katy
feeling
as
if
she
had
accidentally
picked
up
an
elderly
gentleman
or
a
college
professor
pray
how
old
are
you
nearly
nine
replied
the
little
fellow
with
a
bow
katy
too
much
appalled
for
farther
speech
let
him
slide
off
her
lap
but
mr
page
who
was
much
diverted
continued
the
conversation
and
daniel
mounting
a
chair
crossed
his
short
legs
and
discoursed
with
all
the
gravity
of
an
old
man
the
talk
was
principally
about
himself
his
tastes
his
adventures
his
ideas
about
art
and
science
now
and
then
he
alluded
to
his
papa
and
mamma
and
once
to
his
grandfather
my
maternal
grandfather
he
said
was
a
remarkable
man
in
his
youth
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
france
he
was
there
at
the
time
of
the
french
revolution
and
as
it
happened
was
present
at
the
execution
of
the
unfortunate
queen
marie
antoinette
this
of
course
was
not
intentional
it
chanced
thus
my
grandfather
was
in
a
barber
shop
having
his
hair
cut
he
saw
a
great
crowd
going
by
and
went
out
to
ask
what
was
the
cause
the
crowd
was
so
immense
that
he
could
not
extricate
himself
he
was
carried
along
against
his
will
and
not
only
so
but
was
forced
to
the
front
and
compelled
to
witness
every
part
of
the
dreadful
scene
he
has
often
told
my
mother
that
after
the
execution
the
executioner
held
up
the
head
to
the
people
the
eyes
were
open
and
there
was
in
them
an
expression
not
of
pain
not
of
fear
but
of
great
astonishment
and
surprise
this
anecdote
carried
great
astonishment
and
surprise
into
the
company
who
listened
to
it
mr
page
gave
a
sort
of
chuckle
and
saying
by
george
got
up
and
left
the
room
the
girls
put
their
heads
out
of
the
window
that
they
might
laugh
unseen
daniel
gazed
at
their
shaking
shoulders
with
an
air
of
wonder
while
the
grave
couple
at
the
end
of
the
room
who
for
some
moments
had
been
looking
disturbed
drew
near
and
informed
the
youthful
prodigy
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
to
bed
young
ladies
said
the
small
condescending
voice
katy
alone
had
presence
of
countenance
enough
to
return
this
salutation
it
was
a
relief
to
find
that
daniel
went
to
bed
at
all
next
morning
at
breakfast
they
saw
him
seated
between
his
parents
eating
bread
and
milk
he
bowed
to
them
over
the
edge
of
the
bowl
dreadful
little
prig
they
should
bottle
him
in
spirits
of
wine
as
a
specimen
it
the
only
thing
he
ever
be
fit
for
remarked
mr
page
who
rarely
said
so
sharp
a
thing
about
anybody
louisa
joined
them
at
the
station
she
was
to
travel
under
mr
care
and
katy
was
much
annoyed
at
lilly
manner
with
her
it
grew
colder
and
less
polite
with
every
mile
by
the
time
they
reached
ashburn
it
was
absolutely
rude
come
and
see
me
very
soon
girls
said
louisa
as
they
parted
in
the
station
i
long
to
have
you
know
mother
and
little
daisy
oh
there
papa
and
she
rushed
up
to
a
tall
man
who
kissed
her
fondly
shook
hands
with
mr
page
and
touched
his
hat
to
lilly
who
scarcely
bowed
in
return
is
so
horrid
she
remarked
you
get
all
mixed
up
with
people
you
do
want
to
know
people
not
in
society
at
all
how
can
you
talk
such
nonsense
said
her
father
the
agnews
are
thoroughly
respectable
and
agnew
is
one
of
the
cleverest
men
i
know
katy
was
pleased
when
mr
page
said
this
but
lilly
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
looked
cross
papa
is
so
democratic
she
whispered
to
clover
he
do
care
a
bit
who
people
are
so
long
as
they
are
respectable
and
clever
well
why
should
he
replied
clover
lilly
was
more
disgusted
than
ever
ashburn
was
a
large
and
prosperous
town
it
was
built
on
the
slopes
of
a
picturesque
hill
and
shaded
with
fine
elms
as
they
drove
through
the
streets
katy
and
clover
caught
glimpses
of
conservatories
and
shrubberies
and
beautiful
houses
with
and
piazzas
that
ours
said
lilly
as
the
carriage
turned
in
at
a
gate
it
stopped
and
mr
page
jumped
out
here
we
are
he
said
gently
lilly
you
hurt
yourself
well
my
dears
we
very
glad
to
see
you
in
our
home
at
last
this
was
kind
and
comfortable
and
the
girls
were
glad
of
it
for
the
size
and
splendor
of
the
house
quite
dazzled
and
made
them
shy
they
had
never
seen
any
thing
like
it
before
the
hall
had
a
marble
floor
and
busts
and
statues
large
rooms
opened
on
either
side
and
mrs
page
who
came
forward
to
receive
them
wore
a
heavy
silk
with
a
train
and
laces
and
looked
altogether
as
if
she
were
dressed
for
a
party
this
is
the
said
lilly
delighted
to
see
the
girls
looking
so
impressed
is
it
splendid
and
she
led
the
way
into
a
stiff
chilly
magnificent
apartment
where
all
the
blinds
were
closed
and
all
the
shades
pulled
down
and
all
the
furniture
shrouded
in
linen
covers
even
the
picture
frames
and
mirrors
were
sewed
up
in
muslin
to
keep
off
flies
and
the
bronzes
and
alabaster
ornaments
on
the
and
gleamed
through
the
dim
light
in
a
ghostly
way
katy
thought
it
very
dismal
she
imagine
anybody
sitting
down
there
to
read
or
sew
or
do
any
thing
pleasant
and
probably
it
was
not
intended
that
any
one
should
do
so
for
mrs
page
soon
showed
them
out
and
led
the
way
into
a
smaller
room
at
the
back
of
the
hall
well
katy
she
said
how
do
you
like
hillsover
very
well
replied
katy
but
she
did
not
speak
enthusiastically
ah
said
mrs
page
shaking
her
head
it
takes
time
to
shake
off
home
habits
and
to
learn
to
get
along
with
young
people
after
living
with
older
ones
and
catching
their
ways
you
like
it
better
as
you
go
on
katy
privately
doubted
whether
this
was
true
but
she
did
not
say
so
pretty
soon
lilly
offered
to
show
them
upstairs
to
their
room
she
took
them
first
into
three
large
and
elegant
chambers
which
she
explained
were
kept
for
grand
company
and
then
into
a
much
smaller
one
in
a
wing
mother
always
puts
my
friends
in
here
she
remarked
she
says
plenty
good
enough
for
to
thrash
about
in
what
does
she
mean
cried
clover
indignantly
as
lilly
closed
the
door
we
do
thrash
i
ca
imagine
answered
katy
who
was
vexed
too
but
pretty
soon
she
began
to
laugh
people
are
so
funny
she
said
never
mind
clovy
this
room
is
good
enough
i
sure
must
we
unpack
or
will
it
do
to
go
down
in
our
alpacas
asked
clover
i
do
know
replied
katy
in
a
doubtful
tone
perhaps
we
had
better
change
our
gowns
cousin
olivia
always
dresses
so
much
your
blue
muslin
right
on
top
of
the
trunk
you
might
put
on
that
and
i
wear
my
purple
the
girls
were
glad
that
they
had
done
this
for
it
was
evidently
expected
and
lilly
had
dressed
her
hair
and
donned
a
fresh
white
pique
mrs
page
examined
their
dresses
and
said
that
clover
was
a
lovely
blue
but
that
ruffles
were
quite
gone
out
and
every
thing
must
be
made
with
basques
she
supposed
they
needed
quantities
of
things
and
she
had
already
engaged
a
dressmaker
to
work
for
them
thank
you
said
katy
but
i
do
think
we
need
any
thing
we
had
our
winter
dresses
made
before
we
left
home
winter
dresses
last
spring
my
dear
what
were
you
thinking
of
they
must
be
completely
out
of
fashion
you
ca
think
how
little
hillsover
people
know
about
fashions
replied
katy
laughing
but
my
dear
for
your
own
sake
exclaimed
mrs
page
distressed
by
these
lax
remarks
i
look
over
your
things
and
see
what
you
need
katy
did
not
dare
to
say
no
but
she
felt
rebellious
when
they
were
half
through
tea
the
door
opened
and
a
boy
came
in
you
are
late
clarence
said
mr
page
while
mrs
page
groaned
and
observed
clarence
makes
a
point
of
being
late
he
really
deserves
to
be
made
to
go
without
his
supper
shut
the
door
clarence
o
mercy
do
bang
it
in
that
way
i
wish
you
would
learn
to
shut
a
door
properly
here
are
your
cousins
katy
and
clover
carr
now
let
me
see
if
you
can
shake
hands
with
them
like
a
gentleman
and
not
like
a
ploughboy
clarence
a
square
freckled
boy
of
thirteen
with
reddish
hair
and
a
sort
of
red
sparkle
in
his
eyes
looked
very
angry
at
this
address
he
did
not
offer
to
shake
hands
at
all
but
elevating
his
shoulders
said
how
do
in
a
sulky
voice
and
sitting
down
at
the
table
buried
his
nose
without
delay
in
a
glass
of
milk
his
mother
gave
a
disgusted
sigh
what
a
boy
you
are
she
said
your
cousins
will
think
that
you
have
never
been
taught
any
thing
which
is
not
the
case
for
i
sure
i
taken
twice
the
pains
with
you
that
i
have
with
lilly
pray
excuse
him
katy
it
no
use
trying
to
make
boys
polite
is
it
said
katy
thinking
of
phil
and
dorry
and
wondering
what
mrs
page
could
mean
hullo
lilly
broke
in
clarence
spying
his
sister
as
it
seemed
for
the
first
time
how
do
said
lilly
carelessly
i
was
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
you
would
condescend
to
notice
my
existence
i
did
see
you
i
know
you
did
i
never
knew
such
a
boy
you
might
as
well
have
no
eyes
at
all
clarence
scowled
and
went
on
with
his
supper
his
mother
seemed
unable
to
let
him
alone
clarence
do
take
such
large
mouthfuls
clarence
pray
use
your
napkin
clarence
your
elbows
are
on
the
table
sir
now
clarence
do
try
to
speak
until
you
have
swallowed
all
that
bread
came
every
other
moment
katy
felt
very
sorry
for
clarence
his
manners
were
certainly
bad
but
it
seemed
quite
dreadful
that
public
attention
should
be
thus
constantly
called
to
them
the
evening
was
rather
dull
there
was
a
sort
of
company
air
about
the
parlor
which
made
everybody
stiff
mrs
page
did
not
sew
or
read
but
sat
in
a
low
chair
looking
like
a
lady
in
a
fashion
plate
and
asked
questions
about
hillsover
some
of
which
were
not
easy
to
answer
as
for
example
have
you
any
other
intimate
friends
among
the
beside
lilly
about
eight
a
couple
of
young
very
young
gentlemen
came
in
at
the
sight
of
whom
lilly
who
was
half
asleep
brightened
and
became
lively
and
talkative
one
of
them
was
the
hickman
whose
father
married
mr
sister
thus
making
him
in
some
mysterious
way
a
first
cousin
of
lilly
he
was
an
arrowmouth
student
and
seemed
to
have
so
many
jokes
to
laugh
over
with
lilly
that
before
long
they
conversed
in
whispers
the
other
youth
introduced
as
eels
was
left
to
entertain
the
other
three
ladies
which
duty
he
performed
by
sucking
the
head
of
his
cane
in
silence
while
they
talked
to
him
he
too
was
an
arrowmouth
sophomore
in
the
midst
of
the
conversation
the
door
which
stood
ajar
opened
a
little
wider
and
a
dog
head
appeared
followed
by
a
tail
which
waggled
so
beseechingly
for
leave
to
come
farther
that
clover
who
liked
dogs
put
out
her
hand
at
once
he
was
not
pretty
being
of
a
color
with
a
blunt
nose
and
no
particular
sort
of
a
tail
but
looked
and
clover
fondled
him
cordially
while
eels
took
his
cane
out
of
his
mouth
to
ask
what
kind
of
a
dog
is
that
mrs
page
i
sure
i
do
know
she
replied
while
lilly
from
the
distance
added
affectedly
oh
he
the
most
dreadful
dog
eels
my
brother
picked
him
up
in
the
street
and
none
of
us
know
the
least
thing
about
him
except
that
he
the
commonest
kind
of
dog
a
sort
of
cur
i
believe
that
not
true
broke
in
a
stern
voice
from
the
hall
which
made
everybody
jump
and
katy
looking
that
way
was
aware
of
a
vengeful
eye
glaring
at
lilly
through
the
crack
of
the
door
he
a
very
valuable
dog
indeed
half
mastiff
and
half
terrier
with
a
touch
of
the
so
there
miss
the
effect
of
this
remark
was
startling
lilly
gave
a
scream
mrs
page
rose
and
hurried
to
the
door
while
the
dog
hearing
his
voice
rushed
that
way
also
got
before
her
and
almost
threw
her
down
katy
and
clover
could
not
help
laughing
and
eels
meeting
their
amused
eyes
removed
the
cane
from
his
mouth
and
grew
conversible
that
clarence
is
a
droll
chap
he
remarked
confidentially
bright
too
he
be
a
nice
fellow
if
he
was
picked
at
so
much
it
never
does
a
fellow
any
good
to
be
picked
at
now
does
it
miss
carr
no
i
do
think
it
does
i
say
continued
eels
i
seen
you
young
ladies
up
at
hillsover
have
i
are
you
both
at
the
nunnery
yes
it
vacation
now
you
know
i
was
sure
i
seen
you
you
had
a
room
on
the
side
next
the
president
did
you
i
thought
so
we
fellows
did
know
your
names
so
we
called
you
real
nuns
real
nuns
yes
because
you
never
looked
out
of
the
window
at
us
real
nuns
and
sham
nuns
do
you
see
almost
all
the
young
ladies
are
sham
nuns
except
you
and
two
pretty
little
ones
in
the
story
above
fifth
window
from
the
end
oh
i
know
said
clover
much
amused
sally
alsop
you
know
katy
and
amy
erskine
they
are
such
nice
girls
are
they
replied
eels
with
the
air
of
one
who
notes
down
names
for
future
reference
well
i
thought
so
not
so
much
fun
in
them
as
some
of
the
others
i
guess
but
a
fellow
likes
other
things
as
well
as
fun
i
know
if
my
sister
was
there
i
rather
have
her
take
the
dull
line
than
the
other
katy
treasured
up
this
remark
for
the
benefit
of
the
mrs
page
came
back
just
then
and
eels
resumed
his
cane
nothing
more
was
heard
of
clarence
that
night
next
morning
cousin
olivia
fulfilled
her
threat
of
inspecting
the
girls
wardrobe
she
shook
her
head
over
the
simple
untrimmed
merinos
and
thick
cloth
coats
there
no
help
for
it
she
said
but
it
a
great
pity
you
would
much
better
have
waited
and
had
things
fresh
perhaps
it
may
be
possible
to
match
the
merino
and
have
some
sort
of
basque
arrangement
added
on
i
will
talk
to
madame
chonfleur
about
it
meantime
i
shall
get
one
handsome
thick
dress
for
each
of
you
and
have
it
stylishly
made
that
at
least
you
really
need
katy
was
too
glad
to
be
so
easily
let
off
to
raise
objections
so
that
afternoon
she
and
clover
were
taken
out
to
choose
their
material
mrs
page
said
but
really
to
sit
by
while
she
chose
it
for
them
at
the
dressmaker
it
was
the
same
they
stood
passive
while
the
orders
were
given
and
every
thing
decided
upon
is
it
funny
whispered
clover
but
i
do
like
it
a
bit
do
you
it
just
like
elsie
saying
how
she
have
her
things
made
oh
this
dress
is
mine
it
cousin
olivia
replied
katy
she
welcome
to
have
it
trimmed
just
as
she
likes
but
when
the
suits
came
home
she
was
forced
to
be
pleased
there
was
no
no
look
of
finery
every
thing
fitted
perfectly
and
had
the
air
of
finish
which
they
had
noticed
and
admired
in
clothes
katy
almost
forgot
that
she
had
objected
to
the
dresses
as
unnecessary
after
all
it
is
nice
to
look
nice
she
confessed
to
clover
excepting
going
to
the
dressmaker
there
was
not
much
to
amuse
the
girls
during
the
first
half
of
vacation
mrs
page
took
them
to
drive
now
and
then
and
katy
found
some
pleasant
books
in
the
library
and
read
a
good
deal
clover
meantime
made
friends
with
clarence
i
think
his
heart
was
won
that
first
evening
by
her
attentions
to
guest
the
dog
that
mysterious
composite
half
mastiff
and
half
terrier
with
a
touch
of
the
clarence
loved
guest
dearly
and
was
gratified
that
clover
liked
him
for
the
poor
animal
had
few
friends
in
the
household
in
a
little
while
clarence
became
quite
sociable
with
her
and
tolerably
so
with
katy
they
found
him
as
eels
said
a
bright
fellow
and
pleasant
and
enough
when
taken
in
the
right
way
lilly
always
seemed
to
take
him
wrong
and
his
treatment
of
her
was
most
disagreeable
snappish
and
quarrelsome
to
the
last
degree
much
you
do
like
oranges
he
said
one
day
at
dinner
in
answer
to
an
innocent
remark
of
hers
much
i
seen
you
eat
two
at
a
time
without
stopping
pa
lilly
says
she
do
like
oranges
i
seen
her
eat
two
at
a
time
without
stopping
much
she
does
i
seen
her
eat
two
at
a
time
without
stopping
he
kept
this
up
for
five
minutes
looking
from
one
person
to
another
and
repeating
much
she
do
much
till
lilly
was
almost
crying
from
vexation
and
even
clover
longed
to
box
his
ears
nobody
was
sorry
when
mr
page
ordered
him
to
leave
the
room
which
he
did
with
a
last
vindictive
much
addressed
to
lilly
how
can
clarence
behave
so
said
katy
when
she
and
clover
were
alone
i
do
know
replied
clover
he
such
a
nice
boy
sometimes
but
when
he
is
nice
he
the
horridest
boy
i
ever
saw
i
wish
talk
to
him
katy
and
tell
him
how
dreadfully
it
sounds
when
he
says
such
things
no
indeed
he
take
it
much
better
from
you
you
nearer
his
age
and
could
do
it
nicely
and
pleasantly
and
not
make
him
feel
as
if
he
were
being
scolded
poor
fellow
he
gets
plenty
of
that
clover
said
no
more
about
the
subject
but
she
meditated
she
had
a
good
deal
of
tact
for
so
young
a
girl
and
took
care
to
get
clarence
into
a
specially
amicable
mood
before
she
began
her
lecture
look
here
you
bad
boy
how
could
you
tease
poor
lilly
so
yesterday
guest
speak
up
sir
and
tell
your
massa
how
naughty
it
was
oh
dear
now
you
going
to
nag
growled
clarence
in
an
injured
voice
no
i
not
not
the
least
in
the
world
i
promise
not
to
but
just
tell
me
and
clover
put
her
hand
on
the
rough
hair
and
stroked
it
just
tell
me
why
you
for
to
do
such
things
they
not
a
bit
nice
lilly
so
hateful
grumbled
clarence
well
she
is
sometimes
i
know
admitted
clover
candidly
but
because
she
is
hateful
is
no
reason
why
you
should
be
unmanly
unmanly
cried
clarence
flushing
yes
i
call
it
unmanly
to
tease
and
quarrel
and
contradict
like
that
it
like
girls
they
do
it
sometimes
but
i
did
think
a
boy
would
i
thought
he
be
ashamed
does
dorry
ever
quarrel
or
tease
asked
clarence
who
liked
to
hear
about
clover
brothers
and
sisters
not
now
and
never
in
that
way
he
used
to
sometimes
when
he
was
little
but
now
he
real
nice
he
would
speak
to
a
girl
as
you
speak
to
lilly
for
any
thing
in
the
world
he
think
it
being
a
gentleman
stuff
about
gentleman
and
all
that
retorted
clarence
mother
dings
the
word
in
my
ears
till
i
hate
it
well
it
is
rather
teasing
to
be
reminded
all
the
time
i
admit
but
you
ca
wonder
that
your
mother
wants
you
to
be
a
gentleman
clarence
it
the
best
thing
in
the
world
i
think
i
hope
phil
and
dorry
will
grow
up
just
like
papa
for
everybody
says
he
the
most
perfect
gentleman
and
it
makes
me
so
proud
to
hear
them
but
what
does
it
mean
any
way
mother
says
it
how
you
hold
your
fork
and
how
you
chew
and
how
you
put
on
your
hat
if
that
all
i
do
think
it
amounts
to
much
oh
that
is
all
it
being
gentle
do
you
see
gentle
and
nice
to
everybody
and
just
as
polite
to
poor
people
as
to
rich
ones
said
clover
talking
fast
in
her
eagerness
to
explain
her
meaning
and
never
being
selfish
or
noisy
or
pushing
people
out
of
their
place
forks
and
hats
and
all
that
are
only
little
ways
of
making
one
self
more
agreeable
to
other
people
a
gentleman
is
a
gentleman
inside
all
through
oh
i
wish
i
could
make
you
see
what
i
mean
oh
that
it
is
it
said
clarence
whether
he
understood
or
not
clover
could
not
tell
or
whether
she
had
done
any
good
or
not
but
she
had
the
discretion
to
say
no
more
and
certainly
clarence
was
not
offended
for
after
that
day
he
grew
fonder
of
her
than
ever
lilly
became
absolutely
jealous
she
had
never
cared
particularly
for
clarence
affection
but
she
did
not
like
to
have
any
one
preferred
above
herself
it
pretty
hard
i
think
she
told
clover
clare
does
every
thing
you
tell
him
and
he
treats
me
awfully
it
is
a
bit
fair
i
his
sister
and
you
only
a
second
cousin
all
this
time
the
girls
had
seen
almost
nothing
of
louisa
agnew
she
called
once
but
lilly
received
the
call
with
them
and
so
cool
and
stiff
that
louisa
grew
stiff
also
and
made
but
a
short
stay
and
when
the
girls
returned
the
visit
she
was
out
a
few
days
before
the
close
of
vacation
however
a
note
came
from
her
dear
katy
i
am
so
sorry
not
to
have
seen
more
of
you
and
clover
wo
you
come
and
spend
wednesday
with
us
mamma
sends
her
love
and
hopes
you
will
come
early
so
as
to
have
a
long
day
for
she
wants
to
know
you
i
long
to
show
you
the
baby
and
every
thing
do
come
papa
will
see
you
home
in
the
evening
remember
me
to
lilly
she
has
so
many
friends
to
see
during
vacation
that
i
am
sure
she
will
forgive
me
for
stealing
you
for
one
day
yours
affectionately
louisa
katy
thought
this
message
very
politely
expressed
but
lilly
when
she
heard
it
tossed
her
head
and
said
she
really
thought
miss
agnew
might
let
her
name
alone
when
she
wrote
notes
mrs
page
seemed
to
pity
the
girls
for
having
to
go
they
must
she
supposed
as
it
was
a
schoolmate
but
she
feared
it
would
be
stupid
for
them
the
agnews
were
queer
sort
of
people
not
in
society
at
all
agnew
was
clever
people
said
but
really
she
knew
very
little
about
the
family
perhaps
it
would
not
do
to
decline
katy
and
clover
had
no
idea
of
declining
they
sent
a
warm
little
note
of
acceptance
and
on
the
appointed
day
set
off
bright
and
early
with
a
good
deal
of
pleasant
anticipation
the
vacation
had
been
rather
dull
at
cousin
olivia
lilly
was
a
good
deal
with
her
own
friends
and
mrs
page
with
hers
and
there
never
seemed
any
special
place
where
they
might
sit
or
any
thing
in
particular
for
then
to
do
louisa
home
was
at
some
distance
from
mr
page
and
in
a
less
fashionable
street
it
looked
pleasant
and
cosy
as
the
girls
opened
the
gate
there
was
a
small
garden
in
front
with
gay
and
on
the
piazza
which
was
shaded
with
vines
sat
agnew
with
a
little
by
her
side
she
was
a
pretty
and
looking
woman
and
her
voice
and
smile
made
them
feel
at
home
immediately
there
is
no
need
of
anybody
to
introduce
you
she
said
lulu
has
described
you
so
often
that
i
know
perfectly
well
which
is
katy
and
which
is
clover
i
am
so
glad
you
could
come
wo
you
go
right
in
my
by
that
long
window
and
take
off
your
things
lulu
has
explained
to
you
that
i
am
lame
and
never
walk
so
you
wo
think
it
strange
that
i
do
not
show
you
the
way
she
will
be
here
in
a
moment
she
ran
upstairs
to
fetch
the
baby
the
girls
went
into
the
it
was
a
pretty
and
apartment
the
furniture
was
simple
as
could
be
but
bed
and
toilet
and
windows
were
curtained
and
frilled
with
white
and
the
walls
were
covered
thick
with
pictures
photographs
and
sketches
and
drawings
unframed
most
of
them
and
just
pinned
up
without
regularity
so
as
to
give
each
the
best
possible
light
it
was
an
odd
way
of
arranging
pictures
but
katy
liked
it
and
would
gladly
have
lingered
to
look
at
each
one
only
that
she
feared
agnew
would
expect
them
and
would
think
it
strange
that
they
did
not
come
back
just
as
they
went
out
again
to
the
piazza
louisa
came
running
downstairs
with
her
little
sister
in
her
arms
i
was
curling
her
hair
she
explained
and
did
not
hear
you
come
in
daisy
give
katy
a
kiss
now
another
for
clover
is
she
a
darling
embracing
the
child
rapturously
herself
now
is
she
a
little
beauty
perfectly
lovely
cried
the
others
and
soon
all
three
were
seated
on
the
floor
of
the
piazza
with
daisy
in
the
midst
passing
her
from
hand
to
hand
as
if
she
had
been
something
good
to
eat
she
was
used
to
it
and
submitted
with
perfect
good
nature
to
being
kissed
trotted
carried
up
and
down
and
generally
made
love
to
agnew
sat
by
and
laughed
at
the
spectacle
when
baby
was
taken
off
for
her
noonday
nap
louisa
took
the
girls
into
the
parlor
another
odd
and
pretty
room
full
of
prints
and
sketches
and
pictures
of
all
sorts
some
with
frames
others
with
a
knot
of
autumn
leaves
or
a
twist
of
ivy
around
them
by
way
of
a
finish
there
was
a
bowl
of
beautiful
autumn
roses
on
the
table
and
though
the
price
of
one
of
mrs
page
damask
curtains
would
probably
have
bought
the
whole
furniture
of
the
room
every
thing
was
so
bright
and
homelike
and
that
heart
warmed
at
the
sight
they
were
examining
a
portrait
of
louisa
with
daisy
in
her
lap
painted
by
her
father
when
agnew
came
in
the
girls
liked
his
face
at
once
it
was
fine
and
frank
and
nothing
could
be
prettier
than
to
see
him
pick
up
his
sweet
invalid
wife
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
and
carry
her
into
the
to
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
katy
and
clover
agreed
afterward
that
it
was
the
merriest
dinner
they
had
had
since
they
left
home
agnew
told
stories
about
painters
and
painting
and
was
delightful
no
less
so
was
the
nice
gossip
upstairs
in
louisa
room
which
followed
dinner
or
the
afternoon
frolic
with
daisy
or
the
long
evening
spent
in
looking
over
books
and
photographs
altogether
the
day
seemed
only
too
short
as
they
went
out
of
the
gate
at
ten
agnew
following
lo
a
dark
figure
emerged
from
behind
a
tree
and
joined
clover
it
was
clarence
i
thought
i
just
walk
this
way
he
explained
the
house
has
been
dreadfully
dull
all
day
without
you
clover
was
immensely
flattered
but
mrs
page
astonishment
next
day
knew
no
bounds
really
she
said
i
have
hopes
of
clarence
at
last
i
never
knew
him
volunteer
to
escort
anybody
anywhere
before
in
his
life
i
say
remarked
clarence
the
evening
before
the
girls
went
back
to
school
i
say
suppose
you
write
to
a
fellow
sometimes
clover
do
you
mean
yourself
by
fellow
laughed
clover
you
do
suppose
i
meant
george
hickman
or
that
donkey
of
an
eels
did
you
retorted
clarence
no
i
did
well
i
no
objection
to
writing
to
a
fellow
if
that
fellow
is
you
provided
the
fellow
answers
my
letters
will
you
yes
gruffly
but
you
must
show
to
any
girls
or
laugh
at
my
writing
or
i
stop
lilly
says
my
writing
is
like
beetle
tracks
little
she
knows
about
it
though
i
do
write
to
her
promise
clover
yes
i
promise
said
clover
pleased
at
the
notion
of
proposing
a
correspondence
of
his
own
accord
next
morning
they
all
left
for
hillsover
clarence
friendship
and
the
remembrance
of
their
day
with
the
agnews
were
the
pleasantest
things
that
the
girls
carried
away
with
them
from
their
autumn
vacation
chapter
x
a
budget
of
letters
hillsover
october
dearest
elsie
i
did
write
you
last
saturday
because
that
was
the
day
we
came
back
to
school
and
there
has
been
one
minute
since
when
i
could
we
thought
perhaps
miss
jane
would
let
us
off
from
the
abstracts
on
sunday
because
it
was
the
first
day
and
school
was
hardly
begun
and
if
she
had
i
was
going
to
write
to
you
instead
but
she
did
she
said
the
only
way
to
keep
girls
out
of
mischief
was
to
keep
them
busy
rose
red
is
sure
that
something
has
gone
wrong
with
miss
jane
missionary
during
the
vacation
she
so
dreadfully
cross
oh
dear
how
i
do
hate
to
come
back
and
be
scolded
by
her
again
i
forget
if
i
told
you
about
the
abstracts
they
are
of
the
sermons
on
sunday
you
know
and
we
have
to
give
the
texts
and
the
heads
and
as
much
as
we
can
remember
of
the
rest
sometimes
dr
prince
begins
shall
divide
my
subject
into
three
parts
and
tells
what
they
are
going
to
be
when
he
does
that
most
of
the
girls
take
out
their
pencils
and
put
them
down
and
then
they
do
listen
any
more
katy
and
i
do
for
she
says
it
is
right
not
to
listen
some
miss
jane
pretends
that
she
reads
all
the
abstracts
through
but
she
does
for
once
rose
red
just
to
try
her
wrote
in
the
middle
of
hers
am
sitting
by
my
window
at
this
moment
and
a
red
cow
is
going
down
the
street
i
wonder
if
she
is
any
relation
to
seccomb
cow
and
miss
jane
never
noticed
it
but
marked
her
all
the
same
was
it
funny
but
i
must
tell
you
about
our
journey
back
mr
page
came
all
the
way
with
us
and
was
ever
so
nice
clarence
rode
down
in
the
carriage
to
the
depot
he
gave
me
a
real
pretty
and
gold
pencil
for
a
present
i
think
you
and
dorry
would
like
clarence
only
just
at
first
you
might
say
he
was
rather
rude
and
cross
i
did
but
now
i
like
him
ever
so
much
cousin
olivia
gave
katy
a
worked
collar
and
sleeves
and
me
an
embroidered
with
clover
leaves
in
the
corner
was
it
kind
i
sorry
i
said
in
my
last
letter
that
we
did
enjoy
our
vacation
we
did
much
but
it
was
exactly
cousin
olivia
fault
she
meant
we
should
but
she
did
know
how
some
people
do
you
know
and
tell
any
one
i
said
so
will
you
rose
red
got
here
in
the
train
before
we
did
she
was
so
glad
when
we
came
that
she
cried
it
was
because
she
was
waiting
four
hours
at
the
nunnery
without
us
she
said
rose
is
such
a
darling
she
had
a
splendid
vacation
and
went
to
three
parties
and
a
picnic
is
it
queer
her
winter
bonnet
is
black
velvet
trimmed
with
pink
and
so
is
mine
i
wanted
blue
at
first
but
cousin
olivia
said
pink
was
more
stylish
and
now
i
am
glad
because
i
like
to
be
like
rose
katy
and
i
have
got
no
this
term
it
a
good
deal
pleasanter
than
our
old
room
and
the
is
just
outside
the
door
so
we
shall
keep
warm
there
is
sun
too
only
nipson
has
nailed
thick
cotton
over
all
the
window
except
a
little
place
at
top
every
window
in
the
house
is
just
so
you
ca
think
how
mad
the
girls
are
about
it
the
first
night
we
had
an
indignation
meeting
and
passed
resolutions
and
some
of
the
girls
said
they
would
stay
they
should
write
to
their
fathers
to
come
and
take
them
home
none
of
them
did
though
it
perfectly
forlorn
not
being
able
to
look
out
oh
dear
how
i
wish
it
were
spring
we
got
a
new
it
a
great
deal
bigger
than
the
old
one
so
now
we
all
eat
together
and
do
have
any
first
and
second
tables
it
ever
so
much
nicer
for
i
used
to
get
so
dreadfully
hungry
waiting
that
i
did
know
what
to
do
one
thing
is
horrid
though
and
that
is
that
every
girl
has
to
make
a
remark
in
french
every
day
at
dinner
the
remarks
are
about
a
subject
nipson
gives
out
the
subjects
the
subject
was
oiseaux
and
rose
red
said
beaucoup
les
oiseaux
et
surtout
ceux
qui
sont
rotis
which
made
us
all
laugh
that
ridiculous
little
bella
arkwright
said
beaucoup
les
oiseaux
qui
sing
she
thought
sing
was
french
every
girl
in
school
began
beaucoup
les
oiseaux
the
subject
is
cesar
i
sure
i
know
what
to
say
there
is
a
word
in
ollendorf
about
him
there
are
so
many
new
scholars
this
term
as
there
were
last
the
girls
think
it
is
because
nipson
is
so
popular
as
florence
used
to
be
two
or
three
of
the
new
ones
look
pleasant
but
i
know
them
yet
louisa
agnew
is
the
nicest
girl
here
next
to
rose
lilly
page
says
she
is
vulgar
because
her
father
paints
portraits
and
they
do
know
the
same
people
that
cousin
olivia
know
but
she
is
a
bit
we
went
to
spend
the
day
there
just
before
we
left
ashburn
and
her
father
and
mother
are
splendid
their
house
is
just
full
of
all
sorts
of
queer
interesting
things
and
pictures
and
agnew
told
us
ever
so
many
stories
about
painters
and
what
they
did
one
was
about
a
boy
who
used
to
make
figures
of
lions
in
butter
and
afterward
he
became
famous
i
forget
his
name
we
had
a
lovely
time
i
wish
you
could
see
lou
little
sister
daisy
only
two
and
a
perfect
little
beauty
she
has
got
ten
teeth
and
hardly
ever
cries
please
ask
papa
just
as
clover
had
got
to
this
point
she
was
interrupted
by
katy
who
walked
in
with
her
hat
on
and
a
whole
handful
of
letters
see
here
she
cried
is
this
delightful
miss
marsh
took
me
with
her
to
the
and
we
found
these
three
for
you
and
two
for
me
and
one
for
rose
wait
a
minute
till
i
give
rose
hers
and
we
read
them
together
in
another
moment
the
two
were
cosily
seated
with
their
heads
close
together
opening
their
budget
first
came
one
from
papa
my
dear
daughters

for
you

enough
words
with
it
she
folded
the
letter
and
fondled
it
affectionately
he
always
so
busy
replied
clover
do
you
remember
how
he
used
to
sit
down
at
his
desk
and
scrabble
off
his
letters
and
how
somebody
always
was
sure
to
ring
the
bell
before
he
got
through
i
very
glad
to
have
some
money
for
now
i
can
pay

my
turn
to

right
now

dear
clover
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
when
my
turn
comes
to
get
a
letter
all
to
myself
of
course
i
read
papa
and
all
the
rest
you
write
to
the
family
but
it
never
seems
as
if
you
were
talking
to
me
unless
you
begin
elsie
i
wish
some
time
you
put
in
a
little
note
marked
just
for
me
which
nobody
else
need
see
it
would
be
such
fun
please
do
i
should
think
you
would
have
hated
staying
at
cousin
olivia
when
i
read
what
she
said
about
your
travelling
dresses
looking
as
if
they
had
come
out
of
the
ark
i
was
too
mad
for
any
thing
but
i
should
think
you
want
much
to
go
back
to
school
either
though
sometimes
it
must
be
splendid
john
has
named
her
old
stockinet
doll
which
she
used
to
call
face
after
nipson
and
i
made
her
a
muslin
cap
and
dorry
drew
a
pair
of
black
spectacles
round
her
eyes
she
is
a
perfect
fright
and
john
plays
all
the
time
that
dreadful
things
happen
to
her
she
pricks
her
with
pins
and
pretends
she
has
the
and
lets
her
tumble
down
and
hurt
herself
till
sometimes
i
nearly
feel
sorry
though
it
all
when
you
wrote
us
about
only
having
pudding
for
dinner
i
did
a
bit
john
put
her
into
the
that
very
day
and
has
been
starving
her
to
death
ever
since
and
phil
says
it
serves
her
right
you
think
how
awfully
lonely
i
sometimes
get
without
you
if
it
for
helen
gibbs
that
new
girl
i
told
you
about
i
should
know
what
to
do
she
is
the
prettiest
girl
in
miss
mccrane
school
her
hair
curls
just
like
mine
only
it
is
four
times
as
long
and
a
million
times
as
thick
and
her
waist
is
really
and
truly
not
much
bigger
round
than
a
we
the
greatest
friends
she
says
she
loves
me
just
exactly
as
much
as
if
i
was
her
sister
but
she
never
had
any
real
sisters
she
was
quite
mad
the
other
day
because
i
said
i
could
love
her
quite
so
well
as
you
and
katy
and
all
she
would
speak
to
me
but
now
we
made
up
dorry
is
so
awfully
in
love
with
her
that
i
never
can
get
him
to
come
into
the
room
when
she
is
here
and
he
blushes
when
we
tease
him
about
her
but
this
is
a
great
secret
dorry
and
i
play
chess
every
evening
he
almost
always
beats
unless
papa
comes
behind
and
helps
me
phil
has
learned
too
because
he
always
wants
to
do
every
thing
that
we
do
dorry
gives
him
a
castle
and
a
bishop
and
a
knight
and
four
pawns
and
then
beats
him
in
six
moves
phil
gets
so
mad
that
we
ca
help
laughing
last
night
he
buttoned
his
king
up
inside
his
jacket
and
said
you
ca
checkmate
me
now
any
way
cecy
has
come
home
she
is
a
young
lady

does
her
hair
up
quite
different
and
wears
long
dresses
this
winter
she
is
going
to
parties
and
hall
is
going
to
have
a
party
for
her

real
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
at
it
cecy
has
got
some
beautiful
new
dresses
a
white
muslin
a
blue
tarlatan
and
a
pink
silk
the
pink
silk
is
the
prettiest
i
think
cecy
is
real
kind
and
lets
me
see
all
her
things
she
has
got
a
lovely
pin
too
and
a
new
fan
with
ivory
sticks
and
all
sorts
of
things
i
wish
i
was
grown
up
it
must
be
so
nice
i
was
to
tell
you
something
only
you
must
tell
any
body
except
katy
do
you
remember
how
cecy
used
to
say
that
she
never
was
going
out
to
drive
with
young
gentlemen
but
was
going
to
stay
at
home
and
read
the
bible
to
poor
people
well
she
did
tell
the
truth
for
she
has
been
out
three
times
already
with
sylvester
slack
in
his
buggy
when
i
told
her
she
ought
to
do
so
because
it
was
breaking
a
promise
she
only
laughed
and
said
i
was
a
silly
little
girl
it
queer
i
want
to
tell
you
what
an
awful
thing
i
did
the
other
night
maria
avery
invited
me
to
tea
and
papa
said
i
might
go
i
did
want
to
much
but
i
did
know
what
to
tell
maria
so
i
went
you
know
how
poor
they
are
and
how
aunt
izzie
used
to
say
that
they
were
so
i
thought
i
would
take
great
care
not
to
hurry
home
right
after
tea
for
fear
they
would
think
i
was
having
a
good
time
so
i
waited
and
waited
and
waited
and
got
so
sleepy
that
i
had
to
pinch
my
fingers
to
keep
awake
at
last
i
was
sure
that
it
must
be
almost
nine
so
i
asked
avery
if
he
please
take
me
home
and
do
you
believe
when
we
got
there
it
was
a
quarter
past
ten
and
papa
was
coming
for
me
dorry
said
he
guessed
i
must
be
enjoying
myself
to
stay
so
late
i
did
tell
anybody
about
it
for
three
days
because
i
knew
they
laugh
at
me
and
they
did
was
it
funny
and
old
avery
looked
as
sleepy
as
i
felt
and
kept
yawning
behind
her
hand
i
told
papa
if
i
had
a
watch
of
my
own
i
should
make
such
mistakes
and
he
laughed
and
said
see
oh
do
you
suppose
that
means
he
going
to
give
me
one
we
are
so
proud
of
dorry
having
taken
two
prizes
at
the
examination
yesterday
he
took
the
second
latin
prize
and
the
first
mathematics
pullman
says
he
thinks
dorry
is
one
of
the
most
thorough
boys
he
ever
saw
is
that
nice
the
prizes
were
books
one
was
the
life
of
benjamin
franklin
and
the
other
the
life
of
general
butler
papa
says
he
does
think
much
of
the
life
of
butler
but
dorry
has
begun
it
and
says
it
is
splendid
phil
says
when
he
takes
a
prize
he
wants
candy
and
a
new
knife
but
he
have
to
wait
a
good
while
unless
he
studies
harder
than
he
does
now
he
has
just
come
in
to
tease
me
to
go
up
into
the
garret
and
help
him
to
get
down
his
sled
because
he
thinks
it
is
going
to
snow
but
there
is
a
sign
of
it
and
the
weather
is
quite
warm
i
asked
him
what
i
should
say
for
him
to
you
and
he
said
tell
her
to
come
home
and
any
thing
you
please
i
said
i
give
her
your
love
and
say
that
you
are
very
well
and
he
says
yes
miss
elsie
i
guess
you
think
yourself
mighty
well
if
your
head
ached
as
much
as
mine
does
every
day
do
be
frightened
however
for
he
just
as
fat
and
rosey
as
can
be
but
almost
every
day
he
says
he
feels
sick
about
when
papa
was
at
moorfield
miss
finch
believed
him
and
let
him
stay
at
home
two
mornings
i
do
wonder
at
it
for
you
can
think
what
a
face
he
makes
up
but
he
got
well
so
fast
that
she
pays
no
attention
to
him
now
the
other
day
about
eleven
papa
met
him
coming
along
the
road
shying
stones
at
the
birds
and
making
lots
of
noise
he
told
papa
he
felt
so
sick
that
his
teacher
had
let
him
go
home
but
papa
noticed
that
his
mouth
looked
sticky
so
he
opened
his
basket
and
found
that
the
little
scamp
had
eaten
up
all
his
dinner
on
the
road
corned
beef
bread
and
butter
a
great
piece
of
mince
pie
and
six
pears
papa
could
help
laughing
but
he
made
him
turn
around
and
go
right
back
to
school
again
i
told
you
in
my
last
about
johnnie
going
to
school
with
me
now
she
is
very
proud
of
it
and
is
always
talking
about
and
my
school
she
is
twice
as
smart
as
the
other
girls
of
her
age
miss
mccrane
has
put
her
into
the
composition
class
where
they
write
compositions
on
their
slates
the
first
subject
was
kitten
and
john
began
a
dear
little
soft
scratching
thing
only
better
not
pull
her
by
the
tail
but
she
real
cunning
all
the
girls
laughed
and
johnnie
called
out
it
true
anyhow
i
ca
write
any
more
for
i
must
study
my
latin
beside
this
is
the
longest
letter
that
ever
was
i
have
been
four
days
writing
it
please
send
me
one
just
as
long
old
mary
and
the
children
send
lots
of
love
and
papa
says
katy
if
a
pudding
diet
sets
her
to
growing
again
she
must
come
home
at
once
for
he
could
afford
it
oh
dear
how
i
wish
i
could
see
you
please
give
my
love
to
rose
red
she
must
be
perfectly
splendid
your
affectionate
elsie
oh
the
dear
little
duck
is
that
just
like
her
said
clover
i
think
elsie
has
a
real
genius
for
writing
do
you
she
tells
all
the
little
things
and
is
so
droll
and
cunning
nobody
writes
such
nice
letters
who
that
from
katy
cousin
helen
and
it
been
such
a
long
time
coming
just
look
at
this
date
september
a
whole
month
ago
then
she
began
to
read
dear
katy
it
seems
a
long
time
since
we
have
had
a
talk
but
i
have
been
less
well
lately
so
that
it
has
been
difficult
to
write
yesterday
i
sat
up
for
the
first
time
in
several
weeks
and
i
am
dressed
and
beginning
to
feel
like
myself
i
wish
you
could
see
my
room
this
morning
i
often
wish
this
but
it
is
so
particularly
pretty
for
little
helen
has
been
in
with
a
great
basket
full
of
leaves
and
flowers
and
together
we
have
dressed
it
to
perfection
there
are
four
vases
of
roses
a
bowl
full
of
chrysanthemums
and
red
leaves
round
all
my
pictures
the
leaves
are
virginia
creeper
it
does
last
long
but
is
lovely
while
it
lasts
helen
also
brought
a
bird
nest
which
the
gardener
found
in
a
on
the
lawn
it
hangs
on
a
branch
and
she
has
tied
it
to
one
side
of
my
bookshelves
on
the
opposite
side
is
another
nest
quite
different
a
great
gray
hornets
nest
as
big
as
a
which
came
from
the
mountains
a
year
ago
i
wonder
if
any
such
grow
in
the
woods
about
hillsover
in
spite
of
the
red
leaves
the
day
is
warm
as
summer
and
the
windows
stand
wide
open
i
suppose
it
is
cooler
with
you
but
i
know
it
is
delicious
cold
now
that
i
think
of
it
you
must
be
in
ashburn
by
this
time
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
every
moment
of
your
vacation
i
did
not
finish
my
letter
the
day
it
as
begun
dear
katy
and
the
next
morning
it
proved
that
i
was
not
so
strong
as
i
fancied
and
i
had
to
go
to
bed
again
i
am
still
there
and
as
you
see
writing
with
a
pencil
but
do
not
be
worried
about
me
for
the
doctor
says
i
am
mending
and
soon
i
hope
to
be
up
and
in
my
chair
the
red
leaves
are
gone
but
the
roses
are
lovely
as
ever
for
little
helen
keeps
bringing
me
fresh
ones
she
has
just
been
in
to
read
me
her
composition
the
subject
was
and
you
ca
think
how
much
she
found
to
say
about
them
she
is
a
bright
little
creature
and
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
teach
her
i
am
hardly
ever
so
sick
that
she
can
not
come
for
her
lessons
and
she
gets
on
fast
we
have
made
an
arrangement
that
when
she
knows
more
than
i
do
she
is
to
give
me
lessons
and
i
am
not
sure
that
the
time
is
so
very
far
off
i
must
tell
you
about
my
ben
he
is
a
new
canary
which
was
given
me
in
the
summer
and
lately
he
has
grown
so
delightfully
tame
that
i
feel
as
if
it
were
not
a
bird
at
all
but
a
fairy
prince
come
to
live
with
me
and
amuse
me
the
cage
door
is
left
open
always
now
and
he
flies
in
and
out
as
he
likes
he
is
a
restless
inquisitive
fellow
and
visits
any
part
of
the
room
trying
each
fresh
thing
with
his
bill
to
see
if
it
is
good
to
eat
and
then
perching
on
it
to
see
if
it
good
to
sit
upon
he
mistakes
his
own
reflection
in
the
glass
for
another
canary
and
sits
on
the
twittering
and
making
love
to
himself
for
half
an
hour
at
a
time
to
watch
him
is
one
of
my
greatest
amusements
especially
just
now
when
i
am
in
bed
so
much
sometimes
he
hides
and
keeps
so
still
that
i
have
not
the
least
idea
where
he
is
but
the
moment
i
call
ben
and
hold
out
my
finger
wings
begin
to
rustle
and
out
he
flies
and
perches
on
my
finger
he
is
the
least
bit
in
the
world
afraid
but
sits
on
my
head
or
shoulder
eats
out
of
my
mouth
and
kisses
me
with
his
beak
he
is
on
the
pillow
at
this
moment
making
runs
at
my
pencil
of
which
he
is
mortally
jealous
it
is
just
so
with
my
combs
and
brushes
if
i
attempt
to
do
my
hair
he
can
not
bear
to
have
me
do
any
thing
but
play
with
him
i
do
wish
i
could
show
him
to
you
and
clover
little
helen
my
other
pet
has
just
come
in
with
a
sponge
cake
which
she
frosted
herself
she
sends
her
love
and
says
when
you
come
to
me
next
summer
she
will
frost
you
each
one
just
like
it
my
katy
i
had
nothing
to
write
about
and
have
written
it
but
i
never
like
to
keep
silent
too
long
or
let
you
feel
as
if
you
were
forgotten
by
your
loving
cousin
helen
be
sure
to
wear
plenty
of
warm
wraps
for
your
winter
walks

cold

letter

christmas
boxes
october
was
a
delightful
month
clear
and
sparkling
but
early
in
november
the
weather
changed
and
became
very
cold
thick
frosts
fell
every
leaf
vanished
from
the
woods
in
the
gardens
only
blackened
stalks
remained
to
show
where
once
the
summer
flowers
had
been
in
spite
of
the
stove
outside
the
door
no
began
to
be
chilly
more
than
once
katy
found
her
stiff
with
ice
in
the
morning
it
was
a
of
the
what
the
winter
was
to
be
and
the
girls
shivered
at
the
prospect
toward
the
end
of
november
miss
jane
caught
a
heavy
cold
unsparing
of
herself
as
of
others
she
went
on
hearing
her
classes
as
usual
and
nobody
paid
much
attention
to
her
hoarseness
and
flushed
cheeks
until
she
grew
so
much
worse
that
she
was
forced
to
go
to
bed
there
she
stayed
for
nearly
four
weeks
it
made
a
great
change
in
the
school
and
the
girls
found
it
such
a
relief
to
have
her
sharp
voice
and
eyes
taken
away
that
i
am
afraid
they
were
rather
glad
of
her
illness
than
otherwise
katy
shared
in
this
feeling
of
relief
she
did
not
like
miss
jane
it
was
pleasant
not
to
have
to
see
her
or
hear
of
her
but
as
day
after
day
passed
and
still
she
continued
ill
katy
conscience
began
to
prick
one
night
she
lay
awake
a
long
time
and
heard
miss
jane
coughing
violently
katy
feared
she
was
very
sick
and
wondered
who
took
care
of
her
all
night
and
all
day
none
of
the
girls
went
near
her
the
servants
were
always
busy
and
nipson
who
did
not
love
miss
jane
was
busy
too
in
the
morning
while
studying
and
practising
katy
caught
herself
thinking
over
this
question
at
last
she
asked
miss
marsh
how
is
miss
jane
about
the
same
she
is
not
dangerously
ill
the
doctor
says
but
she
coughs
a
great
deal
and
has
some
fever
is
anybody
sitting
with
her
oh
no
there
no
need
of
any
one
susan
answers
the
bell
and
she
has
her
medicine
on
the
table
within
reach
it
sounded
forlorn
enough
katy
had
lived
in
a
so
long
herself
that
she
knew
just
how
dreary
it
is
for
an
invalid
to
be
left
alone
with
medicine
within
reach
and
some
one
to
answer
a
bell
she
began
to
feel
sorry
for
miss
jane
and
almost
without
intending
it
went
down
the
entry
and
tapped
at
her
door
the
come
in
sounded
very
faint
and
miss
jane
as
she
lay
in
bed
looked
weak
and
dismal
and
quite
unlike
the
sharp
terrible
person
whom
the
girls
feared
so
much
she
was
amazed
at
the
sight
of
katy
and
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
hold
up
her
head
and
speak
as
usual
what
is
it
miss
carr
i
only
came
to
see
how
you
are
said
katy
abashed
at
her
own
daring
you
coughed
so
much
last
night
that
i
was
afraid
you
were
worse
there
something
i
could
do
for
you
thank
you
said
miss
jane
you
are
very
kind
think
of
miss
thanking
anybody
and
calling
anybody
kind
i
should
be
very
glad
is
there
any
thing
repeated
katy
encouraged
well
i
do
know
you
might
put
another
stick
of
wood
on
the
fire
said
miss
jane
in
an
ungracious
tone
katy
did
so
and
seeing
that
the
iron
cup
on
top
of
the
stove
was
empty
she
poured
some
water
into
it
then
she
took
a
look
about
the
room
books
and
papers
were
scattered
over
the
table
clean
clothes
from
the
wash
lay
on
the
chairs
nothing
was
in
its
place
and
katy
who
knew
how
particular
miss
jane
was
on
the
subject
of
order
guessed
at
the
discomfort
which
this
untidy
state
of
affairs
must
have
caused
her
would
you
like
to
have
me
put
these
away
she
asked
touching
the
pile
of
clothes
miss
jane
sighed
impatiently
but
she
did
not
say
no
so
katy
taking
silence
for
consent
opened
the
drawers
and
laid
the
clothes
inside
guessing
at
the
right
places
with
a
sort
of
instinct
and
making
as
little
noise
and
bustle
as
possible
next
she
moved
quietly
to
the
table
where
she
sorted
and
arranged
the
papers
piled
up
the
books
and
put
the
pens
and
pencils
in
a
small
tray
which
stood
there
for
the
purpose
lastly
she
began
to
dust
the
table
with
her
pocket
handkerchief
which
proceeding
roused
miss
jane
at
once
do
she
said
there
is
a
duster
in
the
cupboard
katy
could
not
help
smiling
but
she
found
the
duster
and
proceeded
to
put
the
rest
of
the
room
into
nice
order
laying
a
fresh
towel
over
the
bedside
table
and
arranging
watch
medicine
and
spoon
within
reach
miss
jane
lay
and
watched
her
i
think
she
was
as
much
surprised
at
herself
for
permitting
all
this
as
katy
was
at
being
permitted
to
do
it
sick
people
often
consent
because
they
feel
too
weak
to
object
after
all
it
comfortable
to
have
some
one
come
in
and
straighten
the
things
which
for
ten
days
past
had
vexed
her
neat
eyes
with
their
untidiness
lastly
smoothing
the
quilt
katy
asked
if
miss
jane
would
like
to
have
her
pillow
shaken
up
i
do
care
was
the
answer
it
sounded
discouraging
but
katy
boldly
seized
the
pillow
beat
smoothed
and
put
it
again
in
place
then
she
went
out
of
the
room
as
noiselessly
as
she
could
miss
jane
never
saying
thank
you
or
seeming
to
observe
whether
she
went
or
stayed
rose
red
and
clover
could
hardly
believe
their
ears
when
told
where
she
had
been
they
stared
at
her
as
people
stare
at
van
amburgh
when
he
comes
safely
out
of
the
lion
den
my
stars
exclaimed
rose
drawing
a
long
breath
you
did
really
and
she
has
bitten
your
head
off
not
a
bit
said
katy
laughing
what
more
i
going
again
she
was
as
good
as
her
word
after
that
she
went
to
see
miss
jane
very
often
almost
always
there
was
some
little
thing
which
she
could
do
the
fire
needed
mending
or
the
pitcher
to
be
filled
with
or
miss
jane
wanted
the
blinds
opened
or
shut
gradually
she
grew
used
to
seeing
katy
about
the
room
one
morning
she
actually
allowed
her
to
brush
her
hair
and
katy
touch
was
so
light
and
pleasant
that
afterwards
miss
jane
begged
her
to
do
it
every
day
what
makes
you
such
a
good
nurse
she
asked
one
afternoon
rather
abruptly
being
sick
myself
replied
katy
gently
then
in
answer
to
farther
questioning
she
told
of
her
four
years
illness
and
her
life
upstairs
keeping
house
and
studying
lessons
all
alone
by
herself
miss
jane
did
not
say
any
thing
when
she
got
through
but
katy
fancied
she
looked
at
her
in
a
new
and
kinder
way
so
time
went
on
till
christmas
it
fell
on
a
friday
that
year
which
shortened
the
holidays
by
a
day
and
disappointed
many
of
the
girls
only
a
few
went
home
the
rest
were
left
to
pass
the
time
as
best
they
might
till
monday
when
lessons
were
to
begin
again
it
is
much
like
merry
christmas
sighed
clover
to
herself
as
she
looked
up
at
the
uncottoned
space
at
the
top
of
the
window
and
saw
great
wildly
whirling
by
no
felt
cold
and
dreary
and
she
was
glad
to
exchange
it
for
the
round
whose
warm
stove
a
cluster
of
girls
was
huddling
everybody
was
in
bad
spirits
there
was
a
tendency
to
talk
about
home
and
the
nice
time
which
people
were
having
there
and
the
very
bad
time
they
themselves
were
having
at
the
nunnery
is
it
i
shall
cry
all
night
i
know
i
shall
i
am
so
homesick
gulped
lilly
who
had
taken
possession
of
her
mate
shoulder
and
was
weeping
ostentatiously
i
declare
you
just
gummidge
in
copperfield
over
again
said
rose
you
recollect
her
girls
do
you
when
the
porridge
was
burnt
you
know
of
us
felt
the
disappointment
but
gummidge
felt
it
the
most
is
lilly
a
real
gummidge
girls
the
observation
changed
lilly
tears
into
anger
you
as
hateful
and
as
horrid
as
you
can
be
rose
red
she
exclaimed
angrily
then
she
flew
out
of
the
room
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
with
a
bang
there
she
gone
upstairs
to
be
mad
said
louisa
agnew
i
do
care
if
she
has
replied
rose
who
was
in
a
perverse
mood
i
wish
you
had
said
that
rosy
whispered
clover
lilly
really
felt
badly
well
what
if
she
did
so
do
i
feel
badly
and
you
and
the
rest
of
us
lilly
has
taken
out
a
patent
for
bad
feelings
which
nobody
must
infringe
what
business
has
she
to
make
us
feel
badder
by
setting
up
to
be
so
much
worse
than
the
rest
of
the
world
clover
said
nothing
but
went
on
with
a
book
she
was
reading
in
less
than
ten
minutes
rose
whose
sun
seldom
stayed
long
behind
a
cloud
was
at
her
elbow
dimpling
and
coaxing
i
forgive
you
she
whispered
giving
clover
arm
a
little
pinch
what
for
for
being
in
the
right
about
lilly
i
mean
i
was
rather
hateful
to
her
i
confess
never
mind
when
she
comes
downstairs
i
make
up
she
a
crocodile
if
ever
there
was
one
but
as
she
your
cousin
i
be
good
to
her
kiss
me
quick
to
prove
that
you
not
vexed
vexed
indeed
said
clover
kissing
the
middle
of
the
pink
cheek
i
wonder
if
anybody
ever
stayed
vexed
with
you
for
ten
minutes
together
you
you
bless
you
yes
miss
jane
for
example
she
hates
me
like
poison
and
all
the
time
well
what
of
it
i
know
she
sick
but
i
tell
a
lie
pa
on
that
account
where
katy
gone
in
to
see
her
i
believe
one
of
these
days
prophesied
rose
solemnly
she
go
into
that
room
and
she
never
come
out
again
miss
jane
is
getting
back
into
biting
condition
i
advise
katy
to
be
careful
what
that
noise
i
declare
girls
mounting
a
desk
and
peeping
out
of
the
window
somebody
got
a
big
box
a
big
one
here
old
joyce
at
the
door
with
his
sledge
now
who
do
you
suppose
it
is
it
for
me
i
sure
it
for
me
cried
half
a
dozen
voices
bella
my
love
peep
over
the
balusters
and
see
if
you
ca
see
the
name
cried
louisa
and
bella
nothing
loath
departed
at
once
on
this
congenial
errand
no
i
ca
she
reported
coming
back
from
the
hall
the
tipped
up
against
the
wall
there
two
boxes
one
is
big
and
one
is
little
oh
who
can
they
be
for
clamored
the
girls
half
the
school
expected
boxes
and
had
been
watching
the
storm
all
day
with
a
dreadful
fear
that
it
would
block
the
roads
and
delay
the
expected
treasures
at
this
moment
nipson
came
in
there
will
be
the
usual
this
evening
she
announced
all
of
you
will
prepare
lessons
for
monday
morning
miss
carr
come
her
for
a
moment
if
you
please
clover
wondering
followed
her
into
the
entry
a
parcel
has
arrived
for
you
and
a
box
said
nipson
i
presume
that
they
contain
articles
for
christmas
i
will
have
the
nails
removed
and
both
of
them
placed
in
you
room
this
evening
but
i
expect
you
to
refrain
from
examining
them
until
the
vacation
does
not
open
until
after
and
it
will
then
be
too
late
for
you
to
begin
very
well
said
clover
demurely
but
the
minute
nipson
back
was
turned
she
gave
a
jump
and
rushed
into
the
o
girls
she
cried
what
do
you
think
both
the
boxes
are
for
katy
and
me
both
cried
a
disappointed
chorus
yes
both
nipson
said
so
i
so
sorry
for
you
but
is
it
nice
for
us
we
never
had
a
box
from
home
before
you
know
and
i
think
we
should
it
so
far
off
it
too
lovely
but
i
do
hope
yours
will
come
clover
voice
was
so
sympathizing
for
all
its
glee
that
nobody
could
help
being
glad
with
her
you
little
darling
said
louisa
giving
her
a
hug
i
rejoiced
that
the
box
is
yours
the
rest
of
us
are
always
getting
them
and
you
and
katy
never
had
a
thing
before
i
hope
it
a
nice
one
seemed
unusually
long
that
night
the
minute
it
was
over
the
sisters
ran
to
no
there
stood
the
boxes
a
big
wooden
one
with
all
the
nails
taken
out
of
the
lid
and
a
small
paper
one
carefully
tied
up
and
sealed
it
was
almost
more
than
the
girls
could
do
to
obey
orders
and
not
peep
i
feel
something
hard
announced
clover
inserting
a
under
the
lid
oh
do
you
cried
katy
then
making
an
heroic
effort
she
jumped
into
the
bed
it
the
only
way
she
said
you
better
come
too
clovy
blow
the
candle
out
and
let
get
to
sleep
as
fast
as
we
can
so
as
to
make
morning
come
quicker
katy
dreamed
of
home
that
night
perhaps
it
was
that
which
made
her
wake
so
early
it
was
not
five
and
the
room
was
perfectly
dark
she
did
not
like
to
disturb
clover
so
she
lay
perfectly
still
for
hours
as
it
seemed
till
a
faint
gray
dawn
crept
in
and
revealed
the
outlines
of
the
big
box
standing
by
the
window
then
she
could
wait
no
longer
but
crept
out
of
bed
crossed
the
floor
on
and
raising
the
lid
a
little
put
in
her
hand
something
crumby
and
sugary
met
it
and
when
she
drew
it
out
there
fitting
on
her
finger
like
a
ring
was
a
round
cake
with
a
hole
in
the
middle
of
it
oh
it
one
of
debby
jumbles
she
exclaimed
where
what
are
you
doing
give
me
one
too
cried
clover
starting
up
katy
rummaged
till
she
found
another
then
half
frozen
she
ran
back
to
bed
and
the
two
lay
nibbling
the
jumbles
and
talking
about
home
till
dawn
deepened
into
daylight
and
morning
was
fairly
come
breakfast
was
half
an
hour
later
than
usual
which
was
comfortable
as
soon
as
it
was
over
the
girls
proceeded
to
unpack
their
box
the
day
was
so
cold
that
they
wrapped
themselves
in
shawls
and
clover
put
on
a
hood
and
thick
gloves
rose
red
passing
the
door
burst
out
laughing
and
recommended
that
she
should
add
india
rubbers
and
an
umbrella
come
in
cried
the
sisters
come
in
and
help
us
open
our
box
oh
by
the
way
you
have
a
box
have
you
said
rose
who
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
important
fact
and
had
presented
herself
with
the
hope
of
being
asked
to
look
on
thank
you
but
perhaps
i
would
better
come
some
other
time
i
shall
be
in
your
way
you
humbug
said
clover
while
katy
seized
rose
and
pulled
her
into
the
room
there
sit
on
the
bed
you
ridiculous
goose
and
put
on
my
gray
cloak
how
can
you
be
so
absurd
as
to
say
you
wo
you
know
we
want
you
and
you
know
you
came
on
purpose
did
i
well
perhaps
i
did
laughed
rose
then
katy
lifted
off
the
lid
and
set
it
against
the
door
it
was
an
exciting
moment
just
look
here
cried
katy
the
top
of
the
box
was
mostly
taken
up
with
four
square
paper
boxes
round
which
parcels
of
all
shapes
and
sized
were
wedged
and
fitted
the
whole
was
a
miracle
of
packing
it
had
taken
miss
finch
three
mornings
with
assistance
from
old
mary
and
much
advice
from
elsie
to
do
it
so
beautifully
each
box
held
a
different
kind
of
cake
one
was
of
jumbles
another
of
a
third
of
crullers
and
the
fourth
contained
a
big
square
loaf
of
frosted
with
a
circle
of
sugar
almonds
set
in
the
frosting
how
the
trio
exclaimed
at
this
i
never
imagined
any
thing
so
nice
declared
rose
with
her
mouth
full
of
jumble
as
for
those
snaps
they
simply
perfect
what
can
be
in
all
those
fascinating
bundles
do
hurry
and
open
one
katy
dear
little
elsie
the
first
two
bundles
opened
were
hers
a
white
hood
for
katy
and
a
blue
one
for
clover
both
of
her
own
knitting
and
so
nicely
done
the
girls
were
enchanted
how
she
has
improved
said
katy
she
knits
better
than
either
of
us
clover
there
never
was
such
a
clever
little
darling
responded
clover
and
they
patted
the
hoods
tried
them
on
before
the
glass
and
spent
so
much
time
in
admiring
them
that
rose
grew
impatient
i
declare
she
cried
it
is
any
of
my
funeral
i
know
but
if
you
do
open
another
parcel
soon
i
shall
certainly
fall
to
myself
it
seems
as
if
what
with
cold
and
curiosity
i
could
wait
very
well
said
katy
laying
aside
her
hood
with
one
final
glance
take
out
a
bundle
clover
it
your
turn
clover
bundle
was
for
herself
evangeline
in
blue
and
gold
and
pretty
soon
golden
legend
in
the
same
binding
appeared
for
katy
both
these
were
from
dorry
next
came
a
couple
of
round
packages
of
exactly
the
same
size
these
proved
to
be
covered
with
russia
leather
one
marked
katy
from
johnnie
and
the
other
clover
from
phil
it
was
evident
that
the
children
had
done
their
shopping
together
for
presently
two
long
narrow
parcels
revealed
the
carved
precisely
alike
and
these
were
labelled
katy
from
phil
and
clover
from
johnnie
what
fun
it
was
opening
those
bundles
the
girls
made
a
long
business
of
it
taking
out
but
one
at
a
time
exclaiming
admiring
and
exhibiting
to
rose
before
they
began
upon
another
they
laughed
they
joked
but
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
taken
much
to
make
either
of
them
cry
it
was
almost
too
tender
a
pleasure
these
proofs
of
loving
remembrance
from
the
little
one
and
each
separate
article
seemed
full
of
the
very
look
and
feel
of
home
what
can
this
be
said
katy
as
she
unrolled
a
paper
and
disclosed
a
pretty
round
box
she
opened
nothing
was
visible
but
pink
cotton
wool
katy
peeped
beneath
and
gave
a
cry
o
clovy
such
a
lovely
thing
it
from
papa
of
course
it
from
papa
how
could
he
it
a
great
deal
too
pretty
the
lovely
thing
was
a
long
slender
chain
for
katy
watch
worked
in
fine
yellow
gold
clover
admired
it
extremely
and
her
joy
knew
no
bounds
when
farther
search
revealed
another
box
with
a
precisely
similar
chain
for
herself
it
was
too
much
the
girls
fairly
cried
with
pleasure
there
never
was
such
a
papa
in
the
world
they
said
yes
there
is
mine
is
just
as
good
declared
rose
twinkling
away
a
little
from
her
own
eyes
now
do
cry
honeys
your
papa
an
angel
there
no
doubt
about
it
i
never
saw
such
pretty
chains
in
my
life
never
as
for
the
children
they
little
ducks
you
certainly
are
a
wonderful
family
katy
i
dying
to
know
what
is
in
the
blue
parcel
the
blue
parcel
was
from
cecy
and
contained
a
pretty
blue
ribbon
for
clover
there
was
a
pink
one
also
with
a
pink
ribbon
for
katy
everybody
had
thought
of
the
girls
old
mary
sent
them
each
a
yard
measure
miss
finch
a
stocked
with
differently
colored
cottons
alexander
had
cracked
a
bag
full
of
hickory
nuts
did
you
ever
said
rose
when
this
last
was
produced
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
popular
hall
who
mrs
hall
as
clover
unwrapped
a
tiny
carved
easel
she
cecy
mother
explained
clover
was
she
kind
to
send
me
this
katy
and
here
cecy
photograph
in
a
little
frame
for
you
never
was
such
a
wonderful
box
it
appeared
to
have
no
bottom
whatever
under
the
presents
were
parcels
of
figs
prunes
almonds
raisins
candy
under
those
apples
and
pears
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
surprises
at
last
all
were
out
now
said
katy
let
throw
back
the
apples
and
pears
and
then
i
want
you
to
help
divide
the
other
things
and
make
some
packages
for
the
girls
they
are
all
disappointed
not
to
have
their
boxes
i
should
like
to
have
them
share
ours
would
you
clover
yes
indeed
i
was
just
going
to
propose
it
so
clover
cut
squares
of
white
paper
rose
and
katy
sorted
and
divided
and
pretty
soon
and
almonds
and
were
walking
down
all
the
entries
and
a
gladsome
crunching
showed
that
the
girls
had
found
pleasant
employment
none
of
the
boxes
got
through
till
monday
so
except
for
katy
and
clover
the
school
would
have
had
no
christmas
treat
at
all
they
carried
nipson
a
large
slice
of
cake
and
a
basket
full
of
the
beautiful
red
apples
all
the
teachers
were
remembered
and
the
servants
the
was
convened
and
feasted
and
as
for
rose
louisa
and
other
special
cronies
dainties
were
heaped
upon
them
with
such
unsparing
hand
that
they
finally
remonstrated
you
giving
everything
away
you
have
none
left
for
yourselves
yes
we
shall
plenty
said
clover
o
rosy
here
such
a
splendid
pear
you
must
have
this
no
no
protested
rose
but
clover
forced
it
into
her
pocket
the
carrs
box
was
always
quoted
in
the
nunnery
afterward
as
an
example
of
what
papas
and
mammas
could
accomplish
when
they
were
of
the
right
sort
and
really
wanted
to
make
happy
distributing
their
treasures
kept
katy
and
clover
so
busy
that
it
was
not
until
after
dinner
that
they
found
time
to
open
the
smaller
box
when
they
did
so
they
were
sorry
for
the
delay
the
box
was
full
of
flowers
roses
heliotrope
beautiful
red
and
white
carnations
all
so
bedded
in
cotton
that
the
frost
had
not
touched
them
but
they
looked
chilled
and
katy
hastened
to
put
them
in
warm
water
which
she
had
been
told
was
the
best
way
to
revive
drooping
flowers
cousin
helen
had
sent
them
and
underneath
sewed
to
the
box
that
they
might
not
shake
about
and
do
mischief
were
two
flat
parcels
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
and
tied
with
white
ribbon
in
cousin
helen
dainty
way
they
were
of
quilted
silk
delicately
scented
one
white
and
one
lilac
and
to
each
was
pinned
a
loving
note
wishing
the
girls
a
merry
christmas
how
awfully
good
people
are
said
clover
i
do
think
we
ought
to
be
the
best
girls
in
the
world
last
of
all
katy
made
a
choice
little
selection
from
her
stores
a
splendid
apple
a
couple
of
fine
pears
and
handful
of
raisins
and
figs
and
with
a
few
of
the
freshest
flowers
in
a
she
went
down
the
row
and
tapped
at
miss
jane
door
miss
jane
was
sitting
up
for
the
first
time
wrapped
in
a
shawl
and
looking
very
thin
and
pale
katy
who
had
almost
ceased
to
be
afraid
of
her
went
in
cheerily
we
had
a
delicious
box
from
home
miss
jane
full
of
all
sorts
of
things
it
has
been
such
fun
unpacking
it
i
brought
you
an
apple
some
pears
and
this
little
bunch
of
flowers
was
it
a
nice
christmas
for
us
yes
said
miss
jane
very
nice
indeed
i
heard
some
one
saying
in
the
entry
that
you
had
a
box
thank
you
as
katy
set
the
basket
and
glass
on
the
table
those
flowers
are
very
sweet
i
wish
you
a
merry
christmas
i
sure
this
was
much
from
miss
jane
who
could
help
speaking
shortly
even
when
she
was
pleased
katy
withdrew
in
high
glee
but
that
night
just
before
something
happened
so
surprising
that
katy
telling
clover
of
it
afterward
said
she
half
fancied
that
she
must
have
dreamed
it
all
it
was
about
eight
in
the
evening
she
was
passing
down
quaker
row
and
miss
jane
called
and
asked
her
to
come
in
miss
jane
cheeks
were
flushed
and
she
spoke
fast
as
if
she
had
resolved
to
say
something
and
thought
the
sooner
it
was
over
the
better
miss
carr
she
began
i
wish
to
tell
you
that
i
made
up
my
mind
some
time
since
that
we
did
you
an
injustice
last
term
it
is
not
your
attentions
to
me
during
my
illness
which
have
changed
my
opinion
that
was
done
before
i
fell
ill
it
is
your
general
conduct
and
the
good
influence
which
i
have
seen
you
exert
over
other
girls
which
convinced
me
that
we
must
have
been
wrong
about
you
that
is
all
i
thought
you
might
like
to
hear
me
say
this
and
i
shall
say
the
same
to
mrs
nipson
thank
you
said
katy
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
she
half
thought
she
would
kiss
miss
jane
but
somehow
it
did
seem
possible
so
she
shook
hands
very
heartily
instead
and
flew
to
her
room
feeling
as
if
her
feet
were
wings
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
i
want
to
cry
i
am
so
happy
she
told
clover
what
a
lovely
day
this
has
been
and
of
all
that
she
had
received
i
think
katy
considered
this
explanation
with
miss
jane
as
her
very
best
christmas
box
chapter
xii
waiting
for
spring
school
was
a
much
happier
place
after
this
nipson
never
alluded
to
the
matter
but
her
manner
altered
katy
felt
that
she
was
no
longer
watched
or
distrusted
and
her
heart
grew
light
in
another
week
miss
jane
was
so
much
better
as
to
be
hearing
her
classes
again
illness
had
not
changed
her
materially
it
is
only
in
novels
that
rheumatic
fever
sweetens
tempers
and
makes
disagreeable
people
over
into
agreeable
ones
most
of
the
girls
disliked
her
as
much
as
ever
her
tongue
was
just
as
sharp
and
her
manner
as
grim
but
for
katy
from
that
time
forward
there
was
a
difference
miss
jane
was
not
affectionate
to
her
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
be
that
but
she
was
civil
and
considerate
and
in
a
dry
way
friendly
and
gradually
katy
grew
to
have
an
odd
sort
of
liking
for
her
do
any
of
you
know
how
incredibly
long
winter
seems
in
climates
where
for
weeks
together
the
thermometer
stands
at
zero
there
is
something
hopeless
in
such
cold
you
think
of
summer
as
of
a
thing
read
about
somewhere
in
a
book
but
which
has
no
actual
existence
winter
seems
the
only
reality
in
the
world
katy
and
clover
felt
this
hopelessness
growing
upon
them
as
the
days
went
on
and
the
weather
became
more
and
more
severe
ten
twenty
even
thirty
degrees
below
zero
was
no
unusual
register
for
the
hillsover
thermometers
such
cold
half
frightened
them
but
nobody
else
was
frightened
or
surprised
it
was
dry
brilliant
cold
the
december
snows
lay
unmelted
on
the
ground
in
march
and
the
paths
cut
then
were
crisp
and
hard
still
only
the
white
walls
on
either
side
had
risen
higher
and
higher
till
only
a
moving
line
of
hoods
and
tippets
was
visible
above
them
when
the
school
went
out
for
its
daily
walk
morning
after
morning
the
girls
woke
to
find
thick
crusts
of
frost
on
their
and
every
drop
of
water
in
the
or
pitcher
turned
to
solid
ice
night
after
night
clover
who
was
a
chilly
little
creature
lay
shivering
and
unable
to
sleep
notwithstanding
the
hot
bricks
at
her
feet
and
the
many
wraps
which
katy
piled
upon
her
to
katy
herself
the
cold
was
more
bracing
than
depressing
there
was
something
in
her
blood
which
responded
to
the
sharp
tingle
of
frost
and
she
gained
in
strength
in
a
remarkable
way
during
this
winter
but
the
long
storms
told
upon
her
spirits
she
pined
for
spring
and
home
more
than
she
liked
to
tell
and
felt
the
need
of
variety
in
their
monotonous
life
where
the
creeping
days
appeared
like
weeks
and
the
weeks
stretched
themselves
out
and
seemed
as
long
as
months
do
in
other
places
the
girls
resorted
to
all
sorts
of
devices
to
keep
themselves
alive
during
this
dreary
season
they
had
little
epidemics
of
occupation
at
one
time
it
was
spattering
when
all
faces
and
fingers
had
a
tendency
to
smudges
of
india
ink
and
there
was
hardly
a
fine
comb
or
fit
for
use
in
the
establishment
then
a
rage
for
tatting
set
in
followed
by
a
fever
of
every
one
falling
in
love
with
the
same
pattern
at
the
same
time
and
copying
and
recopying
till
nobody
could
bear
the
sight
of
it
at
one
time
clover
counted
eighteen
girls
all
at
work
on
the
same
bead
and
canvas
cushion
later
there
was
a
short
period
of
and
then
came
the
grand
album
craze
when
girls
out
of
the
nine
sent
for
blank
books
bound
in
red
morocco
and
began
to
collect
signatures
and
sentiments
here
also
there
was
a
tendency
toward
repetition
sally
austin
added
to
her
autograph
these
lines
of
her
own
composition
when
on
this
page
your
beauteous
eyes
you
bend
let
it
remind
you
of
your
absent
friend
sally
austin
galveston
texas
the
girls
found
this
sentiment
charming
at
least
a
dozen
borrowed
it
and
in
half
the
albums
in
the
school
you
might
read
when
on
this
page
your
beauteous
eyes
esther
dearborn
wrote
in
clover
book
the
better
part
of
valor
is
discretion
why
she
wrote
it
nobody
knew
or
why
it
was
more
applicable
to
clover
than
to
any
one
else
but
the
sentiment
proved
popular
and
was
repeated
over
and
over
again
above
various
neatly
written
signatures
there
was
a
strife
as
to
who
should
display
the
largest
collection
some
of
the
girls
sent
home
for
autographs
of
distinguished
persons
which
they
pasted
in
their
books
rose
red
however
them
all
did
i
ever
show
you
mine
she
asked
one
day
when
most
of
the
girls
were
together
in
the
no
never
cried
a
number
of
voices
have
you
got
one
oh
do
let
us
see
it
certainly
i
get
it
right
away
if
you
like
said
rose
obligingly
she
went
to
her
room
and
returned
with
a
shabby
old
blank
book
in
her
hand
some
of
the
girls
looked
disappointed
the
cover
of
mine
is
very
nice
explained
rose
i
going
to
have
it
rebound
one
of
these
days
you
see
it
not
a
new
album
at
all
nor
a
school
album
but
it
very
valuable
to
me
here
she
heaved
a
sentimental
sigh
all
my
friends
have
written
in
it
she
said
the
girls
were
quite
impressed
by
the
manner
in
which
rose
said
this
but
when
they
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
album
they
were
even
more
impressed
rose
had
evidently
been
on
intimate
terms
with
a
circle
of
most
distinguished
persons
half
the
autographs
in
the
book
were
from
gentlemen
and
they
were
dated
all
over
the
world
just
listen
to
this
cried
louisa
and
she
read
thou
forget
me
but
never
never
shall
i
forget
thee
alphonso
of
castile
the
escurial
april
he
asked
a
circle
of
girls
did
you
ever
hear
of
him
youngest
brother
of
the
king
of
spain
replied
rose
carelessly
oh
my
and
just
hear
this
exclaimed
annie
silsbie
if
you
ever
deign
to
cast
a
thought
in
my
direction
miss
rose
remember
me
always
as
thy
devoted
servitor
potemkin
montmorency
petersburg
july
and
this
shrieked
alice
white
they
say
love
is
a
thorn
i
say
it
is
a
dart
and
yet
i
can
not
tear
thee
from
my
heart
antonio
count
of
vallambrosa
do
you
really
and
truly
know
a
count
asked
bella
backing
away
from
rose
with
eyes
as
big
as
saucers
know
antonio
de
vallambrosa
i
should
think
i
did
replied
rose
nobody
in
this
country
knows
him
so
well
i
fancy
and
he
wrote
that
for
you
how
else
could
it
get
into
my
book
goosey
this
was
unanswerable
and
rose
was
installed
from
that
time
forward
in
the
minds
of
bella
and
the
rest
as
a
heroine
of
the
first
water
katy
however
knew
better
and
the
first
time
she
caught
rose
alone
she
attacked
her
on
the
subject
now
confess
who
wrote
all
those
absurd
autographs
in
your
book
absurd
autographs
what
can
you
mean
all
those
counts
and
things
no
it
no
use
you
sha
wriggle
away
till
you
tell
me
oh
antonio
and
dear
potemkin
do
you
mean
them
yes
of
course
i
do
and
you
really
want
to
know
yes
and
will
swear
not
to
tell
yes
well
then
bursting
into
a
laugh
i
wrote
every
one
of
them
myself
did
you
really
when
day
before
yesterday
i
thought
lilly
needed
taking
down
she
was
so
set
up
with
her
autographs
of
wendell
phillips
and
seward
so
i
just
sat
down
and
wrote
a
book
full
it
only
took
me
half
an
hour
i
meant
to
write
some
more
in
fact
i
had
one
all
ready
am
dead
or
pretty
near
david
done
for
me
i
goliath
of
gath
but
i
was
afraid
even
bella
would
swallow
that
so
i
tore
out
the
page
i
sorry
i
did
now
for
i
really
think
the
geese
would
have
believed
it
written
in
his
last
moments
you
know
to
oblige
an
ancestor
of
my
own
added
rose
in
a
tone
of
explanation
you
monkey
cried
katy
highly
diverted
but
she
kept
counsel
and
i
daresay
some
of
the
hillsover
girls
believe
in
that
wonderful
album
to
this
day
it
was
not
long
after
that
a
sad
piece
of
news
came
for
bella
her
father
was
dead
their
home
was
in
iowa
too
far
to
allow
of
her
returning
for
the
funeral
so
the
poor
little
girl
stayed
at
school
to
bear
her
trouble
as
best
she
might
katy
who
was
always
kind
to
children
and
had
somewhat
affected
bella
from
the
first
on
account
of
her
resemblance
to
elsie
in
height
and
figure
was
especially
tender
to
her
now
which
bella
repaid
with
the
gift
of
her
whole
queer
little
heart
her
affectionate
demonstrations
were
rather
of
the
monkey
order
and
not
un
frequently
troublesome
but
katy
was
never
otherwise
than
patient
and
gentle
with
her
though
rose
and
even
clover
remonstrated
on
what
they
called
this
singular
intimacy
poor
little
soul
it
so
hard
for
her
and
she
only
eleven
years
old
she
told
them
she
has
such
a
funny
way
of
looking
at
you
sometimes
said
rose
who
was
very
observant
it
is
just
the
air
of
a
squirrel
who
has
hidden
a
nut
and
does
want
you
to
find
out
where
and
yet
can
hardly
help
indicating
it
with
his
paw
she
got
something
on
her
mind
i
sure
half
a
dozen
things
very
likely
added
clover
she
such
a
mischief
but
none
of
them
guessed
what
this
something
was
early
in
january
nipson
announced
that
in
four
weeks
she
proposed
to
give
a
soiree
to
which
all
young
ladies
whose
records
were
entirely
free
from
marks
during
the
intervening
period
would
be
allowed
to
come
this
announcement
created
great
excitement
and
the
school
set
itself
to
be
good
but
marks
were
easy
to
get
and
gradually
one
girl
after
another
lost
her
chance
till
by
the
appointed
day
only
a
limited
party
descended
to
join
the
festivities
and
nearly
half
the
school
was
left
upstairs
to
sigh
over
past
sins
katy
and
rose
were
among
the
unlucky
ones
rose
had
incurred
a
mark
by
writing
a
note
in
and
katy
by
being
five
minutes
late
to
dinner
they
consoled
themselves
by
dressing
clover
hair
and
making
her
look
as
pretty
as
possible
and
then
stationed
themselves
in
the
upper
hall
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
to
watch
her
career
and
get
as
much
fun
out
of
the
occasion
as
they
could
pretty
soon
they
saw
clover
below
on
professor
seccomb
arm
he
was
a
kingly
pleasant
man
with
a
bald
head
and
it
was
a
fashion
among
the
girls
to
admire
him
does
she
look
pretty
said
rose
just
notice
searles
katy
she
grinning
at
clover
like
the
cheshire
cat
what
a
wonderful
cap
that
is
of
hers
she
had
it
when
sylvia
was
here
at
school
eight
years
ago
hush
she
hear
you
no
she
wo
there
ellen
beginning
her
piece
i
know
frightened
by
the
way
she
plays
hark
how
she
hurries
the
time
there
they
are
going
to
have
refreshments
after
all
cried
esther
dearborn
as
trays
of
lemonade
and
appeared
below
on
their
way
to
the
parlor
is
it
a
shame
to
have
to
stay
up
here
professor
seccomb
professor
called
rose
in
a
daring
whisper
take
pity
upon
us
we
are
starving
for
a
piece
of
cake
the
professor
gave
a
jump
then
retreated
and
looked
upward
when
he
saw
the
circle
of
hungry
faces
peering
down
he
doubled
up
with
laughter
wait
a
moment
he
whispered
back
and
vanished
into
the
parlor
pretty
soon
the
girls
saw
him
making
his
way
through
the
crowd
with
an
immense
slice
of
in
each
hand
here
miss
rose
he
said
catch
it
but
rose
ran
downstairs
received
the
cake
dimpled
her
thanks
and
retreated
to
the
darkness
above
whence
sounds
proceeded
which
sent
the
amused
professor
into
the
parlor
convulsed
with
suppressed
laughter
pretty
soon
clover
stole
up
the
back
stairs
to
report
are
you
having
a
nice
time
is
the
good
who
have
you
been
talking
with
inquired
a
chorus
of
voices
pretty
nice
everybody
is
very
old
i
have
been
talking
to
anybody
in
particular
and
the
lemonade
is
only
water
i
guess
it
jollier
up
here
with
you
replied
clover
i
must
go
now
my
turn
to
play
comes
next
down
she
ran
except
for
the
glory
of
the
thing
i
think
we
having
more
fun
than
she
answered
rose
next
week
came
valentine
day
several
of
the
girls
received
valentines
from
home
and
they
wrote
them
to
each
other
katy
and
clover
both
had
one
from
phil
exactly
alike
with
the
same
purple
bird
in
the
middle
of
the
page
and
i
love
you
printed
underneath
and
they
joined
in
fabricating
a
gorgeous
one
for
rose
which
was
supposed
to
come
from
potemkin
de
montmorencey
the
hero
of
the
album
but
the
most
surprising
valentine
was
received
by
miss
jane
it
came
with
the
others
while
all
the
household
were
at
dinner
the
girls
saw
her
redden
and
look
angry
but
she
put
the
letter
in
her
pocket
and
said
nothing
in
the
afternoon
it
came
out
through
bella
that
miss
jane
letter
was
in
poetry
and
that
she
was
just
mad
as
fire
about
it
just
before
tea
louisa
came
running
down
the
row
to
no
where
katy
was
sitting
with
rose
girls
what
do
you
think
that
letter
which
miss
jane
got
this
morning
was
a
valentine
the
most
dreadful
thing
but
so
funny
she
stopped
to
laugh
how
do
you
know
cried
the
other
two
miss
marsh
told
alice
gibbons
she
a
sort
of
cousin
you
know
and
miss
marsh
often
tells
her
things
she
says
miss
jane
and
nipson
are
furious
and
are
determined
to
find
out
who
sent
it
it
was
from
hardhack
miss
jane
missionary
or
no
not
from
hardhack
but
from
a
cannibal
who
had
just
eaten
hardhack
up
and
he
sent
miss
jane
a
lock
of
his
hair
and
the
recipe
the
tribe
cooked
him
by
they
found
him
nice
he
said
and
turned
out
quite
tender
that
was
one
of
the
lines
in
the
poem
did
you
ever
hear
of
any
thing
like
it
who
do
you
suppose
could
have
sent
it
who
could
it
have
been
cried
the
others
katy
had
one
awful
misgiving
but
a
glance
at
rose
face
calm
and
innocent
as
a
baby
reassured
her
it
was
impossible
that
she
could
have
done
this
mischievous
thing
katy
you
see
was
not
privy
to
that
entry
in
rose
journal
pay
miss
jane
off
nor
aware
that
rose
had
just
written
underneath
did
it
nobody
ever
found
out
the
author
of
this
audacious
valentine
rose
kept
her
own
counsel
and
miss
jane
probably
concluded
that
the
better
part
of
valor
was
discretion
for
the
threatened
inquiries
were
never
made
and
now
it
lacked
but
six
weeks
to
the
end
of
the
term
the
girls
counted
the
days
and
practised
various
devices
to
make
them
pass
more
quickly
esther
dearborn
who
had
a
turn
for
arithmetic
set
herself
to
a
careful
calculation
of
how
many
hours
minutes
and
seconds
must
pass
before
the
happy
time
should
come
annie
silsbie
strung
tiny
squares
of
on
a
thread
and
each
night
slipped
one
off
and
burned
it
up
in
the
candle
others
made
diagrams
of
the
time
with
a
division
for
each
day
and
every
night
blotted
one
out
with
a
sense
of
triumph
none
of
these
devices
made
the
time
hasten
it
never
moved
more
slowly
than
now
when
life
seemed
to
consist
of
a
universal
waiting
but
though
katy
heart
bounded
at
the
thought
of
home
till
she
could
hardly
bear
the
gladness
she
owned
to
clover
do
you
know
much
as
i
long
to
get
away
i
am
half
sorry
to
go
it
is
parting
with
something
which
we
shall
never
have
any
more
home
is
lovely
and
i
would
rather
be
there
than
anywhere
else
but
if
you
and
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
we
shall
never
be
girls
at
again
chapter
xiii
paradise
regained
only
seven
days
more
to
cross
off
said
clover
drawing
her
pencil
through
one
of
the
squares
on
the
diagram
pinned
beside
her
glass
seven
more
and
then
oh
joy
papa
will
be
here
and
we
shall
start
for
home
she
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
katy
holding
a
letter
and
looking
pale
and
aggrieved
oh
clover
she
cried
just
listen
to
this
papa
ca
come
for
us
is
it
too
bad
and
she
read
burnet
march
my
dear
girls
i
find
that
it
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
come
for
you
next
week
as
i
intended
several
people
are
severely
ill
and
old
barlow
struck
down
suddenly
with
paralysis
so
i
can
not
leave
i
am
sorry
and
so
will
you
be
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
fortunately
hall
has
just
heard
that
some
friends
of
hers
are
coming
westward
with
their
family
and
she
has
written
to
ask
them
to
take
charge
of
you
the
drawback
to
this
plan
is
that
you
will
have
to
travel
alone
as
far
as
albany
where
peters
friend
will
meet
you
i
have
written
to
ask
mr
page
to
put
you
on
the
train
and
under
the
care
of
the
conductor
on
tuesday
morning
i
hope
you
will
get
through
without
embarassment
peters
will
be
at
the
station
in
albany
to
receive
you
or
if
any
thing
should
hinder
him
you
are
to
drive
at
once
to
the
delavan
house
where
they
are
staying
i
enclose
a
check
for
your
journey
if
dorry
were
five
years
older
i
should
send
him
after
you
the
children
are
most
impatient
to
have
you
back
miss
finch
has
been
suddenly
called
away
by
the
illness
of
her
so
elsie
is
keeping
house
till
you
return
god
bless
you
my
dear
daughters
and
send
you
safe
yours
affectionately
p
carr
oh
dear
said
clover
with
her
lip
trembling
now
papa
wo
see
rosy
no
said
katy
and
rosy
and
louisa
and
the
rest
wo
see
him
that
is
the
worst
of
all
i
wanted
them
to
so
much
and
just
think
how
dismal
it
will
be
to
travel
with
people
we
do
know
it
too
too
bad
i
declare
i
do
think
old
barlow
might
have
put
off
being
ill
just
one
week
longer
grumbled
clover
it
takes
away
half
the
pleasure
of
going
home
the
girls
might
be
excused
for
being
cross
for
this
was
a
great
disappointment
there
was
no
help
for
it
however
as
papa
said
they
could
only
sigh
and
submit
but
the
journey
to
which
they
had
looked
forward
so
much
was
no
longer
thought
of
as
a
pleasure
only
a
disagreeable
necessity
something
which
must
be
endured
in
order
that
they
might
reach
home
five
four
three
days
the
last
little
square
was
crossed
off
the
last
dinner
was
eaten
the
last
breakfast
there
was
much
mourning
over
katy
and
clover
among
the
girls
who
were
to
return
for
another
year
louisa
and
ellen
gray
were
inconsolable
and
bella
with
a
very
small
pocket
handkerchief
held
tightly
in
her
hand
clung
to
katy
every
moment
crying
and
declaring
that
she
would
not
let
her
go
the
last
evening
she
followed
her
into
no
where
she
was
dreadfully
in
the
way
of
the
packing
and
after
various
odd
contortions
and
mysterious
sentences
said
say
wo
you
tell
if
i
tell
you
something
what
is
it
asked
katy
absently
as
she
folded
and
smoothed
her
best
gown
something
repeated
bella
wagging
her
head
mysteriously
and
looking
more
like
a
thievish
squirrel
than
ever
well
what
is
it
tell
me
to
katy
surprise
bella
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
crying
i
real
sorry
i
did
it
she
sobbed
real
sorry
and
now
never
love
me
any
more
yes
i
will
what
is
it
do
stop
crying
bella
dear
and
tell
me
said
katy
alarmed
at
the
violence
of
the
sobs
it
was
for
fun
really
and
truly
it
was
but
i
wanted
some
cake
too
protested
bella
sniffing
very
hard
what
and
i
did
think
anybody
would
know
berry
searles
does
care
a
bit
for
us
little
girls
only
for
big
ones
and
i
knew
if
i
said
bella
he
never
give
me
the
cake
so
i
said
carr
instead
bella
did
you
write
that
note
inquired
katy
almost
to
much
surprised
to
speak
yes
and
i
tied
a
string
to
your
blind
because
i
knew
i
could
go
in
and
draw
it
up
when
you
were
practising
but
i
did
mean
to
do
any
harm
and
when
florence
was
so
mad
and
changed
your
room
i
was
real
sorry
moaned
bella
digging
her
knuckles
into
her
eyes
wo
you
ever
love
me
any
more
she
demanded
katy
lifted
her
into
her
lap
and
talked
so
tenderly
and
seriously
that
her
contrition
which
was
only
half
genuine
became
real
and
she
cried
in
good
earnest
when
katy
kissed
her
in
token
of
forgiveness
of
course
you
go
at
once
to
nipson
said
clover
and
rose
when
katy
imparted
this
surprising
discovery
no
i
think
not
why
should
i
it
would
only
get
poor
little
bella
into
a
dreadful
scrape
and
she
coming
back
again
you
know
nipson
does
not
believe
that
story
now
nobody
does
we
had
it
down
just
as
i
hope
we
should
that
is
much
better
than
having
it
contradicted
i
do
think
so
and
i
should
enjoy
seeing
that
little
wretch
of
a
bella
well
whipped
persisted
rose
but
katy
was
not
to
be
shaken
to
please
me
promise
that
not
a
word
shall
be
said
about
it
she
urged
and
to
please
her
the
girls
consented
i
think
katy
was
right
in
saying
that
nipson
no
longer
believed
her
guilty
in
the
affair
of
the
note
she
had
been
very
friendly
to
both
the
sisters
of
late
and
when
clover
carried
in
her
album
and
asked
for
an
autograph
she
waxed
quite
sentimental
and
wrote
i
would
not
exchange
the
modest
clover
for
the
most
beautiful
parterre
so
bring
it
back
i
pray
thee
to
your
affectionate
teacher
marianne
nipson
which
effusion
quite
overwhelmed
the
modest
clover
and
called
out
the
remark
from
rose
do
she
wish
she
may
get
you
miss
jane
said
twice
i
shall
miss
you
katy
a
speech
which
to
quote
rose
again
made
katy
look
as
surprised
as
balaam
rose
herself
was
not
coming
back
to
school
she
and
the
girls
were
half
at
parting
they
lavished
tears
kisses
promises
of
letters
and
vows
of
eternal
friendship
neither
of
them
it
was
agreed
was
ever
to
love
anybody
else
so
well
the
final
moment
would
have
been
almost
too
tragical
had
it
not
been
for
a
last
bit
of
mischief
on
the
part
of
rose
it
was
after
the
stage
was
actually
at
the
door
and
she
had
her
foot
upon
the
step
that
struck
by
a
happy
thought
she
rushed
upstairs
again
collected
the
girls
and
each
taking
a
window
they
tore
down
the
cotton
flung
open
sashes
and
startled
nipson
who
stood
below
by
the
simultaneous
waving
therefrom
of
many
white
flags
katy
who
was
already
in
the
stage
had
the
full
benefit
of
this
performance
always
after
that
when
she
thought
of
the
nunnery
her
memory
recalled
this
scene
nipson
in
the
bella
blubbering
behind
and
overhead
the
windows
crowded
with
saucy
girls
laughing
and
triumphantly
flapping
the
long
cotton
strips
which
had
for
so
many
months
obscured
the
daylight
for
them
all
at
springfield
next
morning
she
and
clover
said
to
mr
page
and
lilly
the
ride
to
albany
was
easy
and
safe
with
every
mile
their
spirits
rose
at
last
they
were
actually
on
the
way
home
at
albany
they
looked
anxiously
about
the
crowded
depot
for
mr
peters
nobody
appeared
at
first
and
they
had
time
to
grow
nervous
before
they
saw
a
gentle
careworn
little
man
coming
toward
them
in
company
with
the
conductor
i
believe
you
are
the
young
ladies
i
have
come
to
meet
he
said
you
must
excuse
my
being
late
i
was
detained
by
business
there
is
a
great
deal
to
do
to
move
a
family
out
west
he
wiped
his
forehead
in
a
dispirited
way
then
he
put
the
girls
into
a
carriage
and
gave
the
driver
a
direction
we
better
leave
your
baggage
at
the
office
as
we
pass
he
said
because
we
have
to
get
off
so
early
in
the
morning
how
early
the
boat
goes
at
six
but
we
ought
to
be
on
board
by
five
so
as
to
be
well
settled
before
she
starts
the
boat
said
katy
opening
her
eyes
yes
erie
canal
you
know
our
furniture
goes
that
way
so
we
judged
it
best
to
do
the
same
and
keep
an
eye
on
it
ourselves
never
be
separated
from
your
property
if
you
can
help
it
my
maxim
it
the
prairie
belle
one
of
the
finest
boats
on
the
canal
when
do
we
get
to
buffalo
asked
katy
with
an
uneasy
recollection
of
having
heard
that
canal
boats
travel
slowly
buffalo
let
me
see
this
is
tuesday
wednesday
thursday
well
if
we
lucky
we
ought
to
be
there
friday
evening
so
if
we
not
too
late
to
catch
the
night
boat
on
the
lake
you
reach
home
saturday
afternoon
four
days
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
with
dismay
too
deep
for
words
elsie
was
expecting
them
by
thursday
at
latest
what
should
they
do
telegraph
was
the
only
answer
that
suggested
itself
so
katy
scribbled
a
despatch
coming
by
canal
do
expect
us
till
saturday
which
she
begged
peters
to
send
and
she
and
clover
agreed
in
whispers
that
it
was
dreadful
but
they
must
bear
it
as
patiently
as
they
could
oh
the
patience
which
is
needed
on
a
canal
the
motion
which
is
not
so
much
motion
as
standing
still
the
crazy
impulse
to
jump
out
and
help
the
crawling
boat
along
by
pushing
it
from
behind
how
one
grows
to
hate
the
slow
monotonous
glide
the
dull
banks
and
to
envy
every
thing
in
sight
each
man
on
horseback
each
bird
flying
through
the
air
peters
was
a
thin
anxious
woman
who
spent
her
life
anticipating
disasters
of
all
sorts
she
had
her
children
with
her
three
little
boys
and
a
teething
baby
and
such
a
load
of
bundles
and
baskets
and
brown
paper
parcels
that
katy
and
clover
privately
wondered
how
she
could
possibly
have
got
through
the
journey
without
their
help
willy
the
eldest
boy
was
always
begging
leave
to
go
ashore
and
ride
the
towing
horses
sammy
the
second
could
only
be
kept
quiet
by
means
of
crooked
pins
and
of
blue
yarn
while
paul
the
youngest
was
possessed
with
a
curiosity
as
to
the
under
side
of
the
boat
which
resulted
in
his
dropping
his
new
hat
overboard
five
times
in
three
days
peters
and
the
rowing
back
in
a
small
boat
each
time
to
recover
it
peters
sat
on
deck
with
her
baby
in
her
lap
and
was
in
a
perpetual
agony
lest
the
locks
should
work
wrongly
or
the
boys
be
drowned
or
some
one
fail
to
notice
the
warning
cry
bridge
and
have
their
heads
carried
off
from
their
shoulders
nobody
did
but
the
poor
lady
suffered
the
anguish
of
ten
accidents
in
dreading
the
one
which
never
took
place
the
berths
at
night
were
small
and
cramped
restless
children
woke
and
cried
the
cabins
were
close
the
decks
cold
and
windy
there
was
nothing
to
see
and
nothing
to
do
katy
and
clover
agreed
that
they
never
wanted
to
see
a
canal
boat
again
they
were
very
helpful
to
peters
amused
the
boys
and
kept
them
out
of
mischief
and
she
told
her
husband
that
she
really
thought
she
should
have
lived
through
the
journey
if
it
had
been
for
the
miss
carrs
they
were
such
kind
girls
and
so
fond
of
children
but
the
three
days
were
terribly
long
at
last
they
ended
buffalo
was
reached
in
time
for
the
lake
boat
and
once
established
on
board
feeling
the
rapid
motion
and
knowing
that
each
stroke
of
the
paddles
took
them
nearer
home
the
girls
were
rewarded
for
their
long
trial
of
patience
at
four
the
next
afternoon
burnet
was
in
sight
long
before
they
touched
the
wharf
clover
discovered
old
whitey
and
the
carryall
and
alexander
waiting
for
them
among
the
crowd
of
carriages
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
dock
appeared
a
figure
papa
papa
she
shrieked
it
seemed
as
if
the
girls
could
not
wait
for
the
boat
to
stop
and
the
plank
to
be
lowered
how
delightful
it
was
to
feel
papa
again
such
a
sense
of
home
and
comfort
and
shelter
as
came
with
his
touch
i
never
go
away
from
you
again
never
never
repeated
clover
keeping
tight
hold
of
his
hand
as
they
drove
up
the
hill
carr
as
he
gazed
at
his
girls
was
equally
happy
they
were
so
bright
affectionate
and
loving
no
he
could
never
spare
them
again
for
the
or
any
thing
else
he
thought
you
must
be
very
tired
he
said
not
a
bit
i
hardly
ever
tired
now
replied
katy
oh
dear
i
forgot
to
thank
peters
for
taking
care
of
us
said
clover
never
mind
i
did
it
for
you
answered
her
father
oh
that
baby
she
continued
how
glad
i
am
that
it
has
gone
to
toledo
and
i
need
hear
it
cry
any
more
katy
katy
home
we
are
at
the
gate
the
girls
looked
eagerly
out
but
no
children
were
visible
they
hurried
up
the
gravel
path
under
the
locust
boughs
just
beginning
to
bud
there
over
the
front
door
was
an
arch
of
evergreens
with
katy
and
clover
upon
it
in
scarlet
letters
and
as
they
reached
the
porch
the
door
flew
open
and
out
poured
the
children
in
a
tumultuous
little
crowd
they
had
been
on
the
roof
looking
through
a
after
the
boat
we
never
knew
you
had
come
till
we
heard
the
gate
explained
john
and
dorry
while
elsie
hugged
clover
and
phil
locking
his
arms
round
katy
neck
took
his
feet
off
the
floor
and
swung
them
in
and
ecstasy
of
affection
until
she
begged
for
mercy
how
you
are
grown
dorry
you
as
tall
as
i
am
elsie
darling
how
well
you
look
oh
is
it
delicious
delicious
delicious
to
be
at
home
again
there
was
such
a
hubbub
of
endearments
and
explanations
that
carr
could
hardly
make
himself
heard
clover
your
waist
has
grown
as
small
as
a
pin
you
look
just
like
the
beautiful
princess
in
elsie
story
said
johnnie
take
the
girls
into
the
parlor
repeated
carr
it
is
cold
out
here
with
the
door
open
take
upstairs
you
do
know
what
is
upstairs
shouted
phil
whereupon
elsie
frowned
and
shook
her
head
at
him
the
parlor
was
gay
with
daffodils
and
hyacinths
and
vases
of
blue
violets
which
smelt
delightfully
cecy
had
helped
to
arrange
them
elsie
said
and
just
at
that
moment
cecy
herself
came
in
her
hair
was
arranged
in
a
sort
of
of
puffs
with
a
row
of
curls
on
top
where
no
curls
used
to
grow
and
her
appearance
generally
was
very
fine
and
fashionable
but
she
was
the
same
affectionate
cecy
as
ever
and
hugged
the
girls
and
danced
round
them
as
she
used
to
do
at
twelve
she
had
waited
until
they
had
had
time
to
kiss
once
all
round
she
said
and
then
she
really
could
wait
any
longer
now
come
upstairs
suggested
elsie
when
clover
had
warmed
her
feet
and
the
flowers
had
been
admired
and
everybody
had
said
ten
times
over
how
nice
it
was
to
have
the
girls
back
and
the
girls
had
replied
that
it
was
just
as
nice
to
come
back
so
they
all
went
upstairs
elsie
leading
the
way
where
are
you
going
cried
katy
that
the
blue
room
but
elsie
did
not
pause
you
see
she
explained
with
the
in
her
hand
papa
and
i
thought
you
ought
to
have
a
bigger
room
now
because
you
are
young
ladies
so
we
have
fixed
this
for
you
and
your
old
one
is
going
to
be
the
spare
room
instead
then
she
threw
the
door
open
and
led
the
girls
in
see
katy
she
said
this
is
your
bureau
and
this
is
clover
and
look
what
nice
drawers
papa
has
had
put
in
the
closet
two
for
you
and
two
for
her
are
they
convenient
do
you
like
it
and
is
it
a
great
deal
pleasanter
than
the
old
room
oh
a
great
deal
cried
the
girls
it
is
delightful
every
thing
about
it
all
katy
old
treasures
had
been
transferred
from
her
old
quarters
to
this
there
was
her
cushioned
chair
her
table
her
shelf
the
pictures
from
the
walls
there
were
some
new
things
too
a
blue
carpet
blue
paper
on
the
walls
window
curtains
of
fresh
chintz
and
elsie
had
made
a
tasteful
for
each
bureau
and
johnnie
crocheted
mats
for
the
altogether
it
was
as
pretty
a
bower
as
two
sisters
just
grown
into
ladies
could
desire
what
are
those
lovely
things
hanging
on
either
side
of
the
bed
asked
clover
they
were
two
illuminated
texts
sent
as
a
welcome
home
by
cousin
helen
one
was
a
morning
text
and
other
an
evening
text
elsie
explained
the
evening
text
which
bore
the
words
i
will
lay
me
down
to
sleep
and
take
my
rest
for
it
is
thou
lord
only
who
makest
me
dwell
in
safety
was
painted
in
soft
purples
and
grays
and
among
the
poppies
and
silver
lilies
which
wreathed
it
appeared
a
cunning
little
downy
bird
fast
asleep
with
his
head
under
his
wing
the
morning
text
when
i
awake
i
am
still
with
thee
was
in
bright
colors
scarlet
and
blue
and
gold
and
had
a
frame
of
rose
garlands
and
butterflies
and
the
girls
thought
they
had
never
seen
any
thing
so
pretty
such
a
gay
supper
as
they
had
that
night
katy
would
not
take
her
old
place
at
the
she
wanted
to
know
how
elsie
looked
as
housekeeper
she
said
so
she
sat
on
one
side
of
papa
and
clover
on
the
other
and
elsie
poured
the
tea
with
a
mixture
of
delight
and
dignity
which
was
worth
seeing
i
begin
said
katy
and
with
that
morrow
when
she
came
out
of
her
pretty
room
and
took
her
place
once
more
as
manager
of
the
household
her
life
may
be
said
to
have
begun
so
it
is
time
that
i
should
cease
to
write
about
her
lives
may
be
very
interesting
but
they
have
no
rightful
place
in
a
child
book
if
little
girls
will
forget
to
be
little
and
take
it
upon
them
to
become
young
ladies
they
must
bear
the
consequences
one
of
which
is
that
we
can
follow
their
fortunes
no
longer
i
wrote
these
last
words
sitting
in
the
same
green
meadow
where
the
first
words
of
what
katy
did
were
written
a
year
had
passed
but
a
which
seemed
the
same
stood
looking
at
itself
in
the
brook
and
from
the
sounded
tiny
voices
my
little
friends
were
discussing
katy
and
her
conduct
as
they
did
then
but
with
less
spirit
for
one
voice
came
seldom
and
faintly
while
the
other
bold
and
defiant
as
ever
repeated
over
and
over
again
katy
did
katy
did
she
did
did
did
katy
did
sounded
faintly
from
the
farther
rush
she
did
she
did
chirped
the
undaunted
partisan
silence
followed
his
opponent
was
either
convinced
or
tired
of
the
discussion
katy
did
the
words
repeated
themselves
in
my
mind
as
i
walked
homeward
how
much
room
for
there
is
in
the
world
i
thought
what
an
important
part
they
play
and
how
glad
i
am
that
with
all
her
own
and
other
people
doings
so
many
of
these
were
included
among
the
things
which
my
katy
did
at
school
