version
foreword
william
clayton
was
one
of
the
remarkable
characters
of
early
utah
history
born
in
the
county
of
lancashire
england
july
he
was
educated
in
one
of
the
schools
of
his
native
town
and
grew
to
manhood
with
a
love
for
books
and
nature
an
early
convert
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
he
conducted
one
of
the
first
companies
from
england
to
nauvoo
and
there
became
one
of
the
trusted
secretaries
of
the
prophet
joseph
smith
with
the
exodus
from
nauvoo
he
was
clerk
of
the
camp
of
israel
and
when
the
mormon
pioneers
left
winter
quarters
in
april
he
was
appointed
by
brigham
young
one
of
the
historians
of
that
noted
company
his
journal
of
that
memorable
expedition
over
the
plains
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
diaries
we
have
of
that
early
period
of
western
history
he
kept
careful
account
of
the
distances
traveled
each
day
and
his
writings
are
full
of
descriptions
of
the
country
over
which
they
traveled
he
has
noted
the
topography
the
fauna
and
flora
of
the
trail
and
his
descriptions
of
the
activities
of
the
company
indicate
a
well
trained
intellect
in
social
study
his
language
is
simple
and
direct
and
his
care
in
keeping
each
day
distance
and
important
facts
of
the
journey
show
order
and
method
his
hymn
come
come
ye
saints
takes
its
place
as
one
of
the
most
beautiful
hymns
of
western
history
for
it
is
full
of
joyfulness
and
expresses
an
optimism
and
faith
in
god
that
will
always
be
an
inspiration
to
the
one
who
sings
it
it
indicates
that
william
clayton
had
much
of
the
artistic
in
him
although
we
do
know
that
he
took
a
virile
part
in
the
activities
of
life
his
journal
should
be
read
by
all
people
who
are
interested
in
the
west
development
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
distinct
contributions
of
that
early
day
and
shows
that
a
man
of
strength
of
character
wrote
it
it
will
inspire
many
people
to
a
greater
love
and
regard
for
the
work
of
the
pioneers

quarreling
a
call
came
from
the
former
for
volunteers
among
his
chieftains
to
go
to
war
a
man
named

among
those
who
responded
robert
was
skilled
in
arms
after
the
battle
of
hastings
in
in
which
robert
rendered
heroic
service

the
conqueror
conferred
upon

a
mark
of

and

from

robert
clayton
came
all
the
claytons
of
england
and
america
and
by
genealogical
research
the
line
has
been
brought
down
to
the
subject
of
this
sketch
william

was
born

in
the
village
of
charock
moss
township
of
penwortham

of

england
william
was
the
eldest
of
fourteen
children
three
of
these
children

the
influence
of

june
a
brother

november
the
remainder
of
his
brothers
and
sisters
survived
the
persecutions
of
mobs
and
the
early
privations
of
the
church
and
came
to
the
valley
of
the
great
salt
lake
with
the
pioneers
of
utah
william
clayton
first
heard
the
gospel
preached
in
england
by
heber
kimball
and
orson
hyde
with
his
wife
ruth
moon
clayton
whom
he
married
in
england
october
he
listened
to
the
teachings
of
these
missionaries
but
he
was
not
easy
to
convert
his
wife
received
the
gospel
first
and
many
evenings
had
to
be
spent
before
william
clayton
became
a
believer
in
mormonism
he
was
ordained
a
priest
december
and
a
high
priest
april
at
which
time
he
was
appointed
with
willard
richards
counselor
to
joseph
fielding
who
presided
over
the
church
in
europe
september
he
left
england
in
the
packet
ship
arriving
in
new
york
october
and
in
nauvoo
november
in
this
city
he
became
a
trusted
friend
of
the
founders
of
the
church
so
much
so
that
on
february
he
was
appointed
secretary
to
joseph
smith
the
prophet
october
he
became
temple
recorder
and
recorder
of
revelations
in
he
became
treasurer
of
the
city
of
nauvoo
these
appointments
are
indicative
of
the
zeal
with
which
william
clayton
served
the
church
throughout
his
life
what
of
the
personal
characteristics
of
our
subject
as
will
appear
from
his
portrait
on
the
frontispiece
william
clayton
did
not
tend
to
frivolity
or
mirth
but
rather
to
seriousness
and
earnestness
yet
he
was
witty
and
had
a
keen
sense
of
humor
in
the
home
he
was
not
demonstrative
although
he
had
great
love
for
his
home
and
family
and
provided
well
for
their
comfort
he
was
methodical
always
sitting
in
his
own
arm
chair
having
a
certain
place
at
the
table
and
otherwise
showing
his
love
for
order
which
he
believed
the
first
law
of
heaven
his
person
was
clean
and
tidy
his
hands
small
and
dimpled
he
wore
very
little
jewelry
but
what
little
he
had
was
the
best
money
could
buy
he
would
not
carry
a
watch
that
was
not
accurate
and
his
clothing
was
made
from
the
best
material
his
children
remember
him
best
in
black
velvet
coat
and
grey
trousers
and
in
cold
weather
a
cloak
in
place
of
overcoat
the
in
william
clayton
came
from
sturdy
trees
his
character
was
above
all
littleness
he
believed
that
what
was
good
for
him
was
good
for
all
men
and
that
the
measurement
of
our
lives
was
based
upon
our
daily
conduct
towards
each
other
to
him
that
was
god
standard
he
believed
in
perfect
equity
in
the
adjustment
of
the
affairs
of
life
had
he
loved
money
he
could
probably
have
had
it
because
of
his
education
and
executive
ability
but
he
cared
little
for
material
gain
centering
his
zeal
in
the
pursuit
of
honor
and
right
william
clayton
was
honest
and
nothing
to
him
could
justify
an
untruth
he
deplored
waste
or
extravagance
yet
he
never
withheld
from
a
neighbor
in
distress
or
from
the
widow
or
orphan
many
are
those
who
knew
his
generosity
when
his
harvest
was
gathered
bushels
of
grain
and
fruit
found
place
among
those
of
scanty
store
and
many
pairs
of
shoes
and
much
warm
clothing
were
given
to
comfort
the
needy
nor
was
the
homeless
forgotten
but
the
orphan
was
given
a
home
and
joy
by
his
own
fireside
his
religion
was
deeply
rooted
and
nurtured
by
association
with
and
testimony
of
an
eye
witness
to
the
living
god
his
love
for
joseph
smith
was
love
seldom
shown
in
man
for
man
few
men
possessed
stronger
faith
and
courage
these
qualities
alone
could
inspire
a
man
under
circumstances
to
write
such
hymns
of
faith
and
comfort
as
come
come
ye
saints
and
the
resurrection
day
the
record
of
william
clayton
in
utah
kept
pace
with
that
of
previous
years
his
home
was
open
always
to
his
friends
who
loved
to
gather
there
for
social
hours
civic
welfare
always
interested
him
he
was
a
musician
and
played
in
the
pioneer
orchestra
and
that
of
the
salt
lake
theatre
he
was
a
lover
of
community
features
and
took
part
in
dramatic
functions
he
was
treasurer
of
zion
cooperative
mercantile
institution
recorder
of
marks
and
brands
receiver
of
weights
and
measures
and
was
territorial
auditor
his
love
for
education
prompted
many
sacrifices
and
he
tried
hard
to
give
his
children
the
essentials
of
good
schooling
he
had
a
strong
will
although
a
tender
conscience
cowardice
had
no
place
in
him
truly
he
could
say
my
heart
is
fixed
i
know
in
whom
i
trust
joseph
smith
believed
that
they
should
meet
and
associate
in
the
celestial
kingdom
of
god
as
they
had
here
william
clayton
died
december
in
salt
lake
city
services
were
held
in
the
seventeenth
ward
chapel
at
which
his
own
funeral
hymn
was
sung
he

editor
note
the
descendants
of
william
clayton
have
in
recent
years
formed
themselves
into
an
organization
known
as
the
clayton
family
association
this
book
is
offered
to
the
public
by
the
association
with
the
thought
that
a
document
of
such
faithful
description
and
fine
spirit
would
be
welcomed
by
all
people
who
might
be
interested
either
in
the
pioneer
period
of
western
history
or
more
particularly
in
the
exodus
of
the
mormon
people
from
missouri
to
the
valley
of
the
great
salt
lake
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
the
was
not
published
years
ago
and
it
seems
to
require
somewhat
of
an
apology
that
this
interesting
record
should
have
remained
so
long
unknown
and
be
now
brought
out
with
considerable
haste
in
the
effort
to
have
it
ready
for
distribution
to
the
members
of
the
clayton
family
association
on
the
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
their
forefather
on
july
there
has
been
a
sacrifice
of
care
and
deliberation
in
the
preparation
of
this
first
edition
which
is
hoped
the
reader
will
overlook
upon
consideration
of
the
facts
this
lack
of
time
and
care
will
show
itself
more
in
the
text
than
in
any
other
particular
much
of
the
proof
reading
was
done
by
the
undersigned
on
board
train
between
salt
lake
and
california
to
say
the
least
such
surroundings
are
not
conducive
to
the
most
finished
work
it
is
hoped
that
this
circumstance
will
also
make
the
reader
more
tolerant
when
encountering
mistakes
in
the
text
obviously
the
result
of
hasty
proof
reading
at
a
later
date
a
second
edition
will
do
better
justice
to
the
author
of
the
and
will
show
more
consideration
for
the
fine
taste
of
the
reader

been
hard
at
work
preventing
the

their
way

accordingly
turned
back

a
hurry
at

we
started
on
our
journey
after
traveling
about
six
or
seven
miles
we
had
to
go
up
a
very
bad
bluff
which
took
us
till
five
president
young
company
went
ahead
of
us
and
camped
three
miles
from
the
bluff
some
of
our
teams
gave
out
and
we
only
went
about
a
mile
from
the
bluff
and
camped
in
a
little
point
of
timber
a
little
from
the
road
our
teams
were
very
tired
saturday
march
we
started
early
in

and
soon
came
up
with
the
main
body
of
the

i
rode
ahead
about
three
miles
to
hunt
my
cow
we
did
not
have
her
last
night
being
with
the
main
camp
we
traveled
nine
or
ten
miles
and
then
rested
our
teams
we
started
again
and
traveled
three
miles
farther
where
we
found
the
president
and
heber
camped
on
the
brink
of
a
long
bluff
we
concluded
to
go
to
the
other
bank
which
we
did
and
camped
in
a
good
place
in
the
evening
the
band
went
and
played
for
the
president
and
heber
and
then
went
to
a
farmer
house
at
the
owner
request
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
camp
to
play
for
his
family
he
promised
to
give
us
some
honey
if
we
would
play
for
him
we
played
about
an
hour
and
then
left
but
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
of
the
honey
we
learned
afterwards
however
that
hutchinson
had
a
pail
under
his
cloak
and
got
it
full
of
honey
after
the
rest
had
left
the
house
and
kept
it
to
himself
very
slyly
sunday

again
and
soon
came
to
the
shariton
bottoms
which
is
a
very
low
land
for
about
four
miles
the
road
was
bad
and
it
took
us
sometime
to
cross
while
on
the
bottom
root
and
davis
came
again
root
had
asked
permission
of
president
young
to
go
back
to
his
family
some
days
ago
but
it
seems
things
did
not
go
to
suit
him
and
he
followed
his
team
again
it
took
sometime
to
go
up
the
bluff
we
had
to
let
the
teams
down
into
the
shariton
river
by
ropes
and
also
helped
them
up
again
by
the
same
means
our
company
got
over
in
good
season
but
we
concluded
to
camp
after
getting
up
the
bluff

it
would
take
till

for
the
whole

up

overtook
them

saying
if

did
not
wait
or

the

be
disfellowshiped

very
heavily
the

is
very
disagreeable
and
muddy
i

it
looks
more
likely
for

fair
in
the
evening
elder

came
over
and
the

met
opposite
hutchinson
wagon
and

all
the
time
we
were
playing
the
lightning
occasionally
broke
forth
from

northwest
and
at
we
dispersed
just
as
the
storm
approached
before

wind
arrived
and
soon
blew
a
perfect
gale
with
heavy
rain
hail
lightning

for
an
hour
and
then
abated
some
all

and
pack
were
blown
down
the
rain
beat
through
the
wagon
covers
and
drenched
the
families
and
effects
it
was
the
most
severe
storm
we
have
experienced
and
with
such
wind
it
seems
impossible
to
preserve
our
little
clothing
and
provisions
from
being
spoiled
but
in
the
midst
of
all
the
camp
seems
cheerful
and
happy
and
there
are
but
few
sick

fair
but
cold
and
windy
the

considerable
ice

with
about
five
tons
of
stuff
and
only
six
wagons
and
five
yoke
of
oxen
to
take
it
i
have
dealt
out
nearly
all
of
my
provisions
and
have
to
get
more
before
i
can
go
on
it
looks
as
if
i
had
to
be
a
slave
and
take
fare
all
the
journey
for
it
has
worked
that
way
so
far
after
council
i
was
weighing
and
loading
until
night
we
had
some
rain
at
night
wednesday
may
the
morning
fair
but
cloudy
still
loading
my
wagons
and
preparing
to
move
president
young
and
heber
companies
have
gone
and
left
me
i
asked
jones
and
terry
what
provisions
i
should
have
to
leave
them
while
they
put
in
the
crops
they
concluded
that
lbs
of
corn
meal
each
and
from
to
lbs
of
bacon
for
three
of
them
would
be
enough
for
twenty
days
i
think
so
for
we
do
not
use
as
much
meat
in
the
same
time
in
my
whole
family
and
as
to
lbs
of
corn
meal
each
for
so
long
a
time
it
is
far
more
than
my
family
can
have
i
have
also
to
supply
horlick
with
provisions
to
take
him
back
to
nauvoo
and
have
kept
four
of
them
since
they
came
here
while
they
are
to
work
for
themselves
all
this
continues
to
weaken
my
hands
for
the
journey
i
have
to
get
three
new
teamsters
and
also
feed
them
while
the
others
are
living
on
my
food
markham
came
in
the
evening
and
said
the
president
had
sent
word
to
father
bent
to
raise
cattle
enough
to
take
my
load
to
the
new
place
tomorrow
morning
but
i
can
not
go
because
my
horses
have
gone
to
the
mill
for
meal
evening
it
commenced
raining
again
and
rained
nearly
all
night
thursday
may
this
morning
is
fair
but
cloudy
and
like
for
more
rain
jones
has
concluded
to
leave
for
nauvoo
this
morning
and
leave
his
son
to
plant
for
him
i
have
given
him
and
charles
terry
a
letter
of
recommendation
jones
asked
me
and
said
i
would
have
to
leave
him
some
provisions
while
he
put
in
his
crops
but
i
do
not
feel
to
do
it
for
i
think
it
is
far
more
reasonable
that
the
company
for
whom
he
has
been
working
should
supply
him
instead
of
me
doing
it
out
of
the
little
provisions
i
have
i
have
left
charles
and
henry
terry
lbs
of
meal
and
lbs
of
bacon
besides
boarding
them
two
weeks
while
they
have
been
working
on
their
farm
i
went
to
see
brother
bent
about
the
teams
and
from
him
learned
that
he
could
only
raise
three
yoke
of
oxen
and
no
wagon
i
went
to
see
crisman
who
had
promised
two
yoke
and
told
him
i
should
start
in
the
morning
then
went
and
spent
the
day
fixing
the
loads
etc
friday
may
this
morning
crisman
called
and
said
he
should
not
let
his
cattle
go
until
brother
miller
returned
i
then
concluded
to
take
what
teams
i
had
and
take
my
wagons
and
go
on
a
few
miles
i
borrowed
two
yoke
of
oxen
from
sister
kay
and
started
we
got
the
wagons
over
the
river
and
on
the
bluff
about
a
mile
and
then
stopped
to
let
the
teams
feed
i
walked
on
and
met
brothers
miller
pitt
kay
and
hutchinson
with
a
large
drove
of
cows
and
cattle
i
told
brother
miller
my
situation
and
the
request
of
the
president
but
i
could
get
no
satisfaction
we
moved
on
with
half
of
the
wagons
and
i
selected
a
spot
over
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
timber
they
then
went
back
for
the
other
wagons
and
got
them
all
up
about
six
reddings

come
here
also
and
sister
egan
with
one
or
two
others
saturday
may
this
morning
is
fine
but
the
weather
does
look
like
being
fair
long
i
have
concluded
to
send
two
wagons
through
and
wait
until
the
teams
return
before
i
can
move
farther
swap
and
conrad
are
gone
with
all
the
teams
i
have
and
i
have
sent
johnson

they
were
useless
unless
i
could
have
more
the
day
was
very
warm
i
spent
the
day
mostly
reading
afternoon
duzett
hutchinson
and
pitt
arrived
with
their
wagons
sunday
may
spent
the
day
mostly
reading
weather
very
warm
afternoon
bishop
miller
company
passed
but
he
did
not
leave
me
any
cattle
although
he
has
plenty
and
many
cows
this
agrees
with
his
course
for
from
about
two
months
before
we
left
nauvoo
to
the
present
he
has
done
nothing
but
for
himself
monday
may
morning
went
on
the
road
about
two
miles
to
see
if
i
could
meet
keller
and
corbitt
it
rained
and
thundered
some
and
continued
cloudy
through
the
day
tuesday
may
spent
the
morning
reading
afterwards
went
fishing
some
teams
returned
from
camp
and
said
that
some
from
nauvoo
had
arrived
there
which
started
two
weeks
ago
last
saturday
and
that
elder
hyde
had
advised
all
the
saints
to
move
over
the
river
as
fast
as
possible
from
nauvoo
and
they
have
their
ferry
boats
constantly
employed
a
number
are
already
on
their
way
here
wednesday
may
this
morning
is
very
rainy
and
cold
spun
twenty
yards
of
fish
line
and
tied
on
eleven
hooks
swap
and
conrad
returned
soon
after
eleven
they
say
the
camp
is
about
thirty
miles
ahead
they
confirm
the
report
of
some
having
arrived
from
nauvoo
and
say
they
were
told
that
my
father
is
on
his
way
here
the
roads
are
lined
with
teams
on
the
other
road
north
of
this
horlick
came
this
afternoon
for
more
victuals
although
he
is
a
good
wagon
maker
and
carpenter
he
is
either
unwilling
to
work
or
the
camp
at
the
farms
is
unwilling
to
board
him
for
his
work
which
i
hardly
believe
it
seems
as
though
teamsters
are
resolved
to
live
on
me
till
they
eat
all
i
have
and
i
now
lack
about
three
thousand
lbs
of
provisions
to
proceed
with
i
can
learn
of
no
one
who
has
fed
his
teamsters
as
long
as
i
have
after
they
stopped
teaming
and
moreover
the
teamsters
started
with
church
property
but
i
have
sustained
them
out
of
my
own
provisions
towards
evening
it
was
fair
but
still
threatens
to
rain
again
i
can
not
yet
learn
a
word
from
diantha
but
think
she
must
be
on
her
way
my
family
is
yet
in
good
health
except
margaret
who
looks
sick
but
does
complain
thursday
may

raining
this
morning
but
about
noon
it

be
fine
about
five
a
heavy
thunder
storm
came
up
and
it
started
raining
heavily
storm
after
storm
kept
coming
far
into
the
night
wilham
gaboon
called
on
his
way
up
between
the
two

some
in
the
camp

started
on
the
road
to
look
for
a
good
camp
ground
james
started
at
the
same
time
on
horseback
to
see
if
he
could
meet
keller
i
went
about
three
miles
and
waited
till
he
returned
but
no
news
from
keller
i
concluded
to
move
my
camp
about
three
miles
and
sent
james
back
to
load
up
and
come
on
i
waited
until
they
came
it
was
after
five
before
they
came
up
the
loads
being
heavy
and
the
teams
weak
the
loads
being
too
heavy
for
them
we
are
now
camped
on
a
very
pleasant
spot
not
far
from
timber
we
have
camped
near
the
summit
of
a
ridge
where
we
can
see
a
long
way
on
both
the
roads
leading
to
miller
mill
and
to
the
next
camp
soon
after
we
arrived
horace
whitney
passed
i
sent
word
to
the
president
to
send
me
more
teams
i
told
horlick
we
could
not
board
him
any
longer
and
gave
him
a
line
to
father
asking
him
to
board
him
until
he
returns
have
borrowed
some
meal
from
edward
martin
to
get
along
if
keller
come
soon
we
shall
have
to
obtain
something
to
eat
somewhere
or
go
short
we
have
nothing
left
to
eat
but
some
corn
and
being
short
of
milk
we
can
not
cook
it
to
our
advantage
james
and
i
were
consulting
just
at
dusk
as
to
the
wisdom
of
one
of
us
starting
out
to
try
and
meet
keller
and
corbitt
or
see
if
we
could
learn
something
of
them
we
both
felt
positive
they
had
lost
their
horses
while
we
were
talking
we
saw
keller
and
horlick
riding
up
from
the
first
farm
from
keller
we
learned
they
had
got
horses
and
loads
and
were
coming
on
the
other
road
and
would
wait
till
we
came
up
to
meet
them
if
we
thought
best
he
said
the
guard
had
all
returned
and
were
with
the
wagons
this
was
joyful
news
to
us
and
i
felt
my
heart
much
relieved
saturday
may
james
started
out
early
to
meet
the
wagons
after
breakfast
we
started
on
the
road
and
while
standing
keller
came
up
and
said
it
was
about
four
and
a
half
miles
to
where
the
other
road
joins
the
main
road
i
started
ahead
on
foot
and
after
traveling
about
three
miles
came
up
to
the
teams
where
they
had
waited
on
the
road
when
i
got
up
the
guard
seemed
pleased
to
see
me
captain
allen
had
bought
about
bushels
of
meal
and
lbs
of
bacon
they
would
not
receive
any
pay
for
it
they
have
been
faithful
and
diligent
and
have
done
much
there
is
yet
due
them
from
the
meal
and
they
are
determined
i
shall
have
that
too
when
my
teams
came
up
we
put
the
meal
in
the
wagons
and
started
on
we
went
about
a
mile
farther
to
peter
bridge
where
we
concluded
to
camp
for
the
night
we
arranged
our
loading
and
i
concluded
to
let
brother
allen
have
the
wagon
and
team
in
his
hands
which
is
church
property
to
send
back
to
nauvoo
for
his
family
the
guard
made
out
a
list
of
provisions
which
they
wished
me
to
leave
them
which
was
indeed
very
little
i
gave
them
four
pairs
of
shoes
and
probably
three
bushels
of
meal
which
is
all
the
remuneration
they
would
accept
for
all
they
had
brought
they
seemed
well
satisfied
sunday
may
this
morning
i
gave
certificates
of

john
horlick
orville
allen

tollman
starks
mecham
bartlet
and
wright
keller
and
horlick
started

on
about
two
miles
to
where
hutchinson
and
duzett
were
in
camp
i
started
out
on
foot
and
most
of
my
family
soon
after
it
soon
began
to
rain
and
rained
till
i
was
wet
through
i
traveled
on
about
four
and
a
half
miles
but
could
see
no
camp
near
timber
i
stopped
to
rest
at
a
post
put
up
by
stewart
where
the
raccoon
fork
led
off
while
there
josiah
arnold
passed
on
his
way
to
miller
from
him
i
learned
that
there
was
a
camp
ground
about
a
half
a
mile
farther
i
went
on
and
waited
before
any
of
the
wagons
arrived
james
came
up
soon
after
news
arrived
that
swap
had
broke
his
wagon
tongue
i
sent
james
to
help
bring
on
the
loads
we
only
started
with
three
wagons
and
left
three
back
with
corbitt
and
martin
the
teams
worked
hard
all
day
and
at
half
past
nine
the
last
team
arrived
having
taken
all
day
to
travel
about
five
miles
monday
may
this
morning
i
sent
james
and
corbitt
to
go
and
trade
three
horses
and
some
harness
for
cows
about
noon
i
started
out
with
two
wagons
and
left
one
and
about
three
loads
of
stuff
in
care
of
two
of
the
guard
after
we
had
traveled
about
three
miles
i
met
a
messenger
from
the
camp
who
handed
me
two
letters
one
was
from
diantha
and
one
from
brother
whitaker
concerning
a
piece
of
land
we
went
on
about
a
mile
and
crossed
a
creek
where
we
waited
to
rest
our
teams
when
i
read
diantha
letter
it
gave
me
painful
feelings
to
hear
of
her
situation
after
resting
about
an
hour
we
went
on
about
four
miles
farther
and
camped
near
father
baker
camp
on
a
creek
it
was
night
before
we
got
supper
over
i
found
several
men
going
back
to
nauvoo
for
their
families
tuesday
may
wrote
an
answer
to
whitaker
letter
and
also
one
to
diantha
we
started
on
about
eight
and
found
the
road
bad
and
many
bad
creeks
where
the
bridges
had
been
washed
away
after
traveling
two
miles
one
of
my
wagons
loaded
with
corn
meal
was
upset
in
a
hole
but
after
about
an
hour
labor
we
got
the
loading
in
the
wagon
was
not
much
damaged
we
proceeded
about
three
miles
farther
and
met
two
men
with
six
yoke
of
oxen
which
president
young
had
sent
to
meet
us
this
was
a
great
relief
to
us
for
we
saw
that
we
could
not
get
to
camp
today
because
of
our
teams
being
so
worn
down
we
rested
our
teams
about
an
hour
and
then
started
on
at
a
good
pace
we
found
several
more
very
bad
creeks
to
pass
but
we
did
not
have
much
difficulty
duzett
and
myself
drove
the
cows
edward
martin
drove
his
horses
about
sundown
we
arrived
in
camp
having
traveled
about
thirteen
miles
this
place

called
mt
pisgah

a
very
beautiful
situation
the
prairie
rolling
and
rich
skirted
with
beautiful
groves
of
timber
on
the
main
fork
of
the
grand
river
soon
after

arrived
elder
kimball
came
to
welcome
us
to
camp
and
then
came
elder
richards
and
family
and
president
young
who
all
seemed
glad
to
see
us
in
camp
wednesday
may
this
morning
my
horses
and
one
cow
and
several
of
the
oxen
are

went
to

bishop
whitney
about
getting
teams
to
send
back
for
the
loads
remaining
but
could
get
no
satisfaction
from
him
i
went
back
and
unloaded
two
wagons

the
ground
and
about
the
same
time
saw
the

would
send
for

bluffs
but
i
must
go
with
them
and
leave
james
and
corbitt
and
egan
to
bring
on
the
wagons
they
have
etc
i
can
not
think
they
understand
my
situation
in
regard
to
the
teams
or
they
would
make
some
definite
move
about
it
they
intend
to
start
in
a
day
or
two
and
i
tried
to
fix
the
wagons
in
good
order

no
chance

get
even

beside

having
traveled
about
twelve
miles
two
indians
are
here
and
we
have
learned
their

hot
we
started
about

and
found
the
roads
good
but
over
hills
and
ravines
all
the
day
at
six
we
camped
in
sight
of
the
pottawattamie
indian
village
when
about
two
miles
from
it
they
discovered
us
coming
and
we
soon
saw
a
number
of
them
riding
towards
us
some
had
bells
on
their
horses
which
frightened
our
horses
and
cattle
james
and
i
took
the
horses
and
let
the
others
take
the
oxen
the
best
way
they
could
some
of
the
indians
followed
our
wagons
and
inquired
often
for
whiskey
we
had
to
pass
some
timber
and
a
river
before
we
arrived
at
their
village
which
is
situated
on
a
very
beautiful
ridge
skirted
by
timber
and
beautiful
rolling
prairie
before
we
arrived
at
the
timber
it
seemed
that
the
whole
village
had
turned
out
men
women
and
children
some
on
horses
and
many
on
foot
their
musicians
came
and
played
while
we
passed
them
they
seemed
to
escort
our
wagons
and
asked
if
we
were
mormons
when
we
told
them
we
were
they
seemed
highly
pleased
it
took
us
some
time
to
cross
the
bridge
over
the
river
and
then
we
were
perfectly
surrounded
by
indians
apparently
from
curiosity
and
friendship
they
watched
us
cross
the
bridge
and
others
followed
on
with
us
the
boys
seemed
to
learn
the
words
our
teamsters
used
to
drive
the
cattle
and
would
run
and
in
their
way
help
to
drive
they
manifested
every
feeling
of
friendship
and
nothing
unkind
or
unfriendly
transpired
soon
after
we
passed
the
bridge
we
were
met
by
jas
cummings
and
the
brethren
from
shariton
ford
with
john
butler
to
bring
emmet
company
to
meet
us
the
cattle
have
been
with
company
from
the
time
they
left
nauvoo
the
road
leads
within
about
two
hundred
yards
of
the
indians
and
i
wanted
to
go
about
two
miles
farther
to
save
the
necessity
of
having
a
guard
but
soon
after
we
left
the
village
we
had
to
ford
a
stream
which
was
deep
and
bad
to
cross
i
then
concluded
to
camp
on
the
ridge
above
the
ford
and
in
sight
of
the
village
being
about
a
half
or
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
them
many
of
them
followed
us
men
women
and
children
and
watched
all
our
movements
but
about
dark
all
departed
in
peace
they
seemed
well
pleased
with
their
visit
they
certainly
showed
every
mark
of
friendship
and
kindness
imaginable
and
treated
us
as
brothers
we
learned
that
the
chief
daughter
was
buried
today
we
have
traveled
about
fifteen
miles
from
cummings

learned
that

had
left
his
things
belonging
to
the
company

him

of
the

went

a
mind
to
and
during
the
last
week
when
james
and
corbitt

he
would
go

swimming
instead

be
without

a
report
that
there
has
been
a
battle
fought
in

and
some
of
the
brethren
killed
friday
september
i
learned
today
that
the
mob
had
made
it
known
that
they
were
coming
to
drive
out
the
mormons
the
governor
sent
an
officer
to
raise
volunteers
to
disperse
the
mob
but
the
mob
learning
this
they
came
sooner
than
they
had
calculated
the
brethren
being
apprised
of
the
intentions
of
the
mob
prepared
to
meet
them
as
well
as
their
circumstances
would
permit
some
of
the
new
citizens
also
made
preparations
to
join
the
brethren
they
made
five
cannon
shot
of
an
old
steam
boat
shaft
they
also
filled
some
barrels
with
powder
old
iron
which
were
buried
in
the
pass
to
the
city
which
could
be
fired
by
a
slow
match
but
this
was
of
no
avail
as
some
traitors
informed
the
mob
of
it
hence
they
did
not
come
into
the
settled
part
of
the
city
on
saturday
the
the
mob
made
their
appearance
being
about
twelve
hundred
in
number
the
brethren
and
some
of
the
new
citizens
in
the
whole
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
went
to
give
them
battle
but
many
of
the
new
citizens
and
some
of
the
brethren
when
they
saw
the
numbers
of
the
mob
fled
and
left
about
one
hundred
nearly
all
brethren
to
fight
the
enemy
the
mob
had
pieces
of
cannon
they
met
near
boscow
store
on
winchester
street
the
cannon
of
the
mob
were
two
blocks
from
the
brethren
and
the
other
part
of
rifle
men
one
block
from
them
the
mob
fired
a
number
of
times
into
barlow
old
barn
expecting
many
of
the
brethren
were
concealed
there
but
in
this
they
were
disappointed
the
brethren
chiefly
lying
down
on
the
ground
behind
some
shelter
and
fired
in
that
position
they
fought
one
hour
and
twenty
minutes
when
the
mob
offered
terms
of
compromise
which
were
these
that
all
the
mormons
should
leave
the
city
within
five
days
leaving
ten
families
to
finish
the
unsettled
business
the
brethren
consented
to
this
inasmuch
as
they
had
been
well
informed
that
more
were
coming
to
join
the
mob
and
they
had
nothing
to
expect
from
the
authorities
of
the
state
lyman
johnson
one
of
the
twelve
headed
a
party
of
the
mob
from
keokuk
iowa
territory
three
of
the
brethren
were
killed
viz
william
anderson
his
son
and
norris
a
blacksmith
three
others
wounded
the
mob
would
not
own
to
any
of
their
party
being
killed
but
one
person
saw
them
put
sixteen
men
into
one
wagon
and
handled
them
more
like
dead
persons
than
wounded
the
ground
where
they
stood
was
pretty
much
covered
with
blood
so
that
there
is
no
doubt
they
had
many
slain
or
wounded
they
had
baggage
wagons
esquire
wells
took
command
of
the
brethren
and
rode
to
and
fro
during
the
whole
battle
without
receiving
injury
although
the
balls
whistled
by
him
on
every
side
amos
davis
fought
bravely
while
running
across
a
plowed
field
he
stumbled
and
fell
on
his
left
arm
which
formed
a
triangle
with
his
head
as
he
fell
a
cannon
ball
passed
through
the
angle
of
his
arm
between
that
and
his
head
hiram
kimball
received
a
slight
wound
with
a
musket
ball
on
the
forehead
the
mob
fired
shots
with
the
cannon
and
ten
rounds
with
the
muskets
making
musket
balls
only
killing
three
and
wounding
three
the
brethren
did
not
fire
so
much
in
proportion
but
did
much
more
execution
truly
the
lord
fights
the
battles
of
his
saints
the
cannon
of
the
brethren
was
not
of
much
service
they
would
not
carry
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
whereas
those
of
the
mob
would
hold
well
a
half
a
mile
they
shot
nine
balls
through
a
small
smith
shop
one
through
wells
barn
and
one
at
his
house
but
the
ball
struck
the
ground
in
front
of
his
house
and
glanced
through
the
well
curb
the
mayor
of
quincy
watched
the
battle
from
the
tower
of
the
temple
and
owned
that
history
never
afforded
a
parallel
the
brethren
then
began
to
get
their
families
and
effects
over
the
river
where
they
remain
in
a
suffering
and
destitute
condition
until
wagons
and
means
are
sent
from
the
saints
to
their
relief
on
the
thursday
following
the
mob
strong
entered
the
city
is
said
from
good
authority
that
such
is
the
distress
and
sufferings
of
the
saints
as
actually
to
draw
tears
from
this
mob
saturday
september
russell

me

cape

severely
with
pain
in
my
head
and
face
i
slept
with
philo
johnson
monday
april
at
at
the
sound
of
the
bugle
i
arose
my
face
still
paining
me
very
badly
after
eating
breakfast
i
started
out
on
foot
before
the
wagons
started
with
my
rifle
on
my
shoulder
at
the
wagons
began
to
move
and
at
were
all
formed
in
double
file
and
proceeded
on
after
traveling
about
eight
miles
we
arrived
at
a
number
of
small
lakes
where
were
many
ducks
a
number
of
the
brethren
shot
at
them
and
killed
several
at
we
arrived
at
a
bend
in
the
river
where
a
small
stream
runs
around
an
island
we
stayed
here
to
feed
awhile
having
traveled
about
fifteen
miles
mostly
a
western
course
with
the
wind
south
the
roads
very
good
and
the
country
very
level
on
these
flat
bottoms
of
the
platte
river
which
bottoms
appear
to
be
from
ten
to
fifteen
miles
wide
soon
after
the
camp
was
formed
rockwell
jackson
redding
and
little
came
in
from
winter
quarters
they
arrived
at
they
have
found
richard
mare
which
was
lost
east
of
the
elk
horn
and
brought
her
to
camp
they
brought
me
a
line
from
diantha
and
one
from
ruth
and
margaret
in
the
last
was
a
very
gentle
piece
of
information
which
has
caused
me
to
reflect
much
and
proves
to
me
that
ruth
and
margaret
virtue
and
integrity
have
for
the
last
year
been
far
superior
to
mine
in
my
letter
to
them
i
requested
them
to
attend
to
family
prayer
in
my
absence
a
thing
which
i
have
neglected
since
leaving
nauvoo
they
informed
me
that
they
had
done
that
when
i
was
at
home
but
unknown
to
me
and
they
had
then
and
still
continue
to
bear
me
up
before
their
heavenly
father
oh
what
integrity
what
faithfulness
i
feel
unworthy
to
possess
two
such
treasures
but
still
feel
to
try
to
reward
them
for
it
and
may
my
father
in
heaven
bless
them
and
all
my
family
and
let
his
angels
guard
them
and
me
during
my
absence
that
we
may
all
be
permitted
to
meet
again
and
enjoy
each
other
society
in
this
world
for
many
years
to
come
and
eternal
in
the
world
to
come
o
lord
grant
this
prayer
of
thine
unworthy
servant
and
fill
my
family
with
peace
and
union
and
open
a
way
that
they
may
have
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
and
thy
name
shall
have
the
praise
even
so
amen
i
received
by
porter
some
few
fish
hooks
and
lines
a
ball
of
fish
line
and
three
pencils
but
no
small
hooks
nor
knives
or
wafers
at
twenty
minutes
after
the
wagons
began
to
move
again
in
the
same
order
as
this
morning
and
traveled
until
when
we
arrived
at
a
very
pretty
open
view
of
the
platte
river
and
the
encampment
was
formed
in
a
on
its
banks
having
traveled
since
noon
about
five
miles
and
in
the
whole
day
miles
over
the
same
kind
of
dry
level
sandy
bottom
the
river
here
appears
to
be
about
a
mile
wide
but
very
shoal
there
is
not
much
timber
where
we
are
camped
and
the
water
is
pretty
muddy
i
walked
some
this
afternoon
in
company
with
orson
pratt
and
suggested
to
him
the
idea
of
fixing
a
set
of
wooden
cog
wheels
to
the
hub
of
a
wagon
wheel
in
such
order
as
to
tell
the
exact
number
of
miles
we
travel
each
day
he
seemed
to
agree
with
me
that
it
could
be
easily
done
at
a
trifling
expense
after
the
encampment
was
formed
i
went
to
brother
luke
johnson
and
asked
him
to
draw
my
tooth
which
has
pained
me
so
much
for
a
long
time
while
i
was
speaking
to
him
stephen
markham
came
up
and
wanted
him
to
take
his
team
and
the
revenue
cutter
the
name
by
which
the
leather
boat
is
called
back
about
two
miles
as
they
designed
to
seine
in
one
of
the
lakes
brother
luke
johnson
drives
the
team
which
draws
the
boat
and
rides
in
the
boat
as
in
a
wagon
i
concluded
i
would
go
and
watch
them
fish
and
started
out
on
foot
i
overtook
markham
and
john
higbee
and
in
our
conversation
i
mentioned
to
brother
john
higbee
the
same
idea
i
had
advanced
to
orson
pratt
and
he
also
seemed
to
coincide
fully
after
arriving
at
the
lake
they
launched
the
boat
and
made
three
hauls
they
only
caught
a
snapping
turtle
four
small
turtles
one
duck
two
small
cat
fish
and
two
creek
suckers
they
then
concluded
to
return
and
i
started
on
foot
again
with
two
rifles
to
carry
i
got
back
to
camp
before
they
overtook
me
and
being
perfectly
tired
and
very
footsore
went
to
bed
but
had
no
rest
on
account
of
the
severe
pain
in
my
head
and
face
tuesday
april
arose
at
my
head
and
face
very
bad
indeed
i
ate
but
little
breakfast
although
we
had
a
couple
of
ducks
and
a
snipe
we
started
out
at
the
morning
pleasant
except
a
strong
west
wind
at
arrived
at
shell
creek
which
is
about
six
or
eight
feet
wide
and
a
poor
bridge
over
it
but
all
the
wagons
got
well
over
this
is
about
five
miles
from
where
we
camped
last
night
we
then
passed
through
a
small
grove
of
timber
and
entered
again
upon
the
wide
open
prairie
bottom
at
we
stopped
beside
a
small
slough
or
lake
to
feed
and
eat
being
five
miles
from
shell
creek
while
stopping
here
three
deer
passed
about
half
a
mile
west
of
the
wagons
rockwell
and
thomas
brown
chased
them
on
horses
four
or
five
miles
but
did
not
succeed
in
taking
any
of
them
the
wind
has
fallen
considerably
and
it
is
very
warm
and
dusty
at
started
again
the
horse
teams
taking
the
lead
traveled
about
ten
miles
farther
and
encamped
near
a
cotton
wood
grove
on
the
banks
of
the
river
the
encampment
was
formed
about
half
past
five
tanner
bellows
and
anvil
were
set
up
and
a
number
of
tires
set
before
dark
john
higbee
luke
johnson
markham
and
some
others
started
ahead
of
the
camp
about
noon
and
went
about
two
miles
farther
than
this
place
to
a
lake
with
the
boat
and
seine
they
took
over
very
nice
fish
and
arrived
with
them
about
the
time
the
camp
was
formed
the
fish
were
distributed
around
the
camp
according
to
the
number
of
persons
in
each
wagon
generally
two
to
a
wagon
and
the
brethren
enjoyed
a
good
supper
on
fish
i
went
to
the
river
and
washed
my
feet
which
were
very
dusty
and
sore
i
also
washed
my
socks
as
well
as
i
could
in
cold
water
without
soap
after
brother
luke
johnson
had
got
through
distributing
fish
i
went
and
asked
him
to
draw
my
tooth
he
willingly
agreed
and
getting
his
instruments
i
sat
down
in
a
chair
he
lanced
the
gum
then
took
his
nippers
and
jerked
it
out
the
whole
operation
did
not
take
more
than
one
minute
he
only
got
half
the
original
tooth
the
balance
being
left
in
the
jaw
after
this
my
head
and
face
pained
me
much
more
than
before
i
ate
but
little
supper
and
then
lay
down
but
could
not
sleep
for
pain
till
near
morning
the
evening
was
very
calm
and
pleasant
wednesday
april
arose
at
my
face
easier
but
swollen
and
my
gums
raw
took
breakfast
on
fish
and
coffee
but
ate
no
bread
it
being
very
dry
and
hard
i
could
not
bear
to
put
it
in
my
mouth
at
seven
started
on
foot
the
ox
teams
being
gone
ahead
some
appearances
of
rain
and
a
slight
shower
fell
wind
northeast
and
pretty
cool
at
ten
minutes
to
nine
an
indian
rode
up
to
the
first
wagon
and
appeared
very
friendly
soon
after
six
or
eight
others
came
running
on
foot
they
came
from
the
timber
about
a
mile
to
the
left
at
we
arrived
at
a
fork
in
the
road
the
one
on
the
left
leading
to
the
new
pawnee
village
and
the
one
to
the
right
leaving
the
village
some
distance
to
the
south
a
consultation
was
held
by
president
young
with
father
case
relative
to
the
roads
crossing
the
river
when
it
was
concluded
to
take
the
right
hand
road
we
proceeded
accordingly
and
at
came
in
sight
of
the
new
pawnee
village
in
an
open
spot
on
the
south
bank
of
the
loop
fork
between
two
bodies
of
timber
the
village
appeared
to
be
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
south
of
the
road
we
were
on
at
we
were
opposite
the
village
and
could
then
see
distinctly
upwards
of
lodges
set
pretty
close
together
and
appeared
to
be
ranged
in
several
lines
and
set
in
good
order
we
proceeded
until
we
arrived
at
a
long
narrow
lake
by
the
side
of
the
timber
and
near
to
the
river
at
the
encampment
was
formed
on
the
bank
of
the
lake
and
a
guard
instantly
placed
at
the
passes
as
many
of
the
indians
had
followed
us
although
they
had
to
wade
the
river
but
it
is
very
shoal
one
of
the
indians
presented
several
certificates
from
persons
who
had
previously
traveled
through
their
village
all
certifying
that
the
grand
chief
of
the
pawnees
was
friendly
disposed
and
they
had
made
him
presents
of
a
little
powder
lead
salt
etc
heber
gave
them
a
little
tobacco
and
a
little
salt
president
young
gave
to
the
chief
some
powder
lead
salt
and
a
number
of
the
brethren
gave
a
little
flour
each
the
old
chief
however
did
not
seem
to
think
the
presents
sufficient
and
said
he
did
not
like
us
to
go
west
through
their
country
he
was
afraid
we
should
kill
their
buffalo
and
drive
them
off
brother
shumway
told
him
we
did
not
like
buffalo
but
this
does
not
appear
to
give
him
much
satisfaction
however
there
was
no
appearance
of
hostility
in
fact
all
that
came
to
camp
seemed
highly
pleased
to
shake
hands
with
our
brethren
and
would
run
from
one
side
to
another
so
as
not
to
miss
one
a
number
of
the
squaws
were
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
with
mattocks
digging
roots
brother
shumway
says
there
are
about
twelve
thousand
of
the
pawnees
in
this
neighborhood
and
it
is
reported
that
there
are
five
thousand
warriors
we
did
not
see
many
of
them
larpy
is
at
their
village
trading
and
it
is
uncertain
whether
he
will
endeavor
to
use
an
influence
for
us
or
against
us
we
have
no
fear
however
because
their
only
object
appears
to
be
plunder
and
it
is
the
calculation
to
be
well
prepared
by
night
and
day
during
the
resting
hour
i
spent
the
time
writing
in
my
journal
at
the
ox
teams
started
out
again
and
the
horse
teams
soon
after
the
weather
had
been
calm
and
pleasant
for
a
few
hours
but
about
or
a
little
before
some
heavy
clouds
began
to
gather
and
thunder
was
heard
at
a
distance
about
the
rain
began
to
descend
heavily
accompanied
by
heavy
peals
of
thunder
and
vivid
lightning
which
continued
till
about
a
strong
north
wind
blew
up
the
rain
and
thunder
ceased
and
the
weather
grew
very
cold
we
traveled
till
and
the
encampment
was
formed
on
the
loop
fork
of
the
platte
river
after
the
encampment
was
formed
and
teams
turned
out
the
brethren
were
all
called
together
and
some
remarks
made
by
president
young
advising
them
to
have
a
strong
guard
round
the
camps
tonight
he
called
for
volunteers
to
stand
guard
and
about
volunteered
amongst
whom
were
all
the
twelve
except
richards
this
guard
was
divided
into
two
companies
of
fifty
each
one
company
to
stand
the
first
half
the
night
and
the
remainder
the
last
half
those
of
the
twelve
who
stood
took
the
first
watch
till
brigham
and
heber
both
stood
on
guard
out
of
the
companies
a
party
were
stationed
as
a
picket
guard
some
distance
from
the
camp
the
balance
stood
near
the
camp
the
night
was
very
cold
with
a
strong
wind
from
the
northeast
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
rained
considerable
our
course
this
morning

about
west
this
afternoon
northwest
we
are
now
within
three
miles
from
the
bluffs
on
the
north
we
have
traveled
today
about
twenty
miles
the
roads
being
good
and
very
level
the
grass
here
is
short
but
looks
good
the
buffalo
grass
is
very
short
and
curly
like
the
hair
on
a
buffalo
robe
the
spring
grass
does
seem
to
be
as
early
here
as
at
the
elk
horn
and
the
last
year
growth
not
being
burnt
off
will
be
rather
a
disadvantage
to
the
spring
companies
i
have
noticed
all
the
way
on
this
bottom
from
the
elk
horn
that
the
ground
is
full
of
wild
onions
which
appear
far
richer
and
larger
than
any
wild
onions
i
ever
saw
i
have
no
idea
that
corn
would
grow
here
for
the
land
is
very
dry
and
loose
and
sandy
and
appears
poor
the
country
is
beautiful
and
pleasing
to
the
eye
of
the
traveler
although
you
can
only
see
one
kind
of
scenery
for
several
days
thursday
april
arose
soon
after
my
face
very
painful
again
caused
by
the
cold
there
has
been
no
trouble
from
the
indians
and
all
is
peace
and
safe
the
cannon
was
prepared
for
action
and
stood
all
night
just
outside
the
wagons
there
was
considerable
joking
this
morning
on
account
of
two
of
the
picket
guard
having
their
guns
stolen
and
colonel
markham
having
his
hat
stolen
the
owners
were
found
asleep
while
on
guard
and
those
who
found
them
so
took
their
guns
to
be
a
warning
to
them
but
it
is
difficult
for
men
to
keep
awake
night
after
night
after
traveling
miles
in
the
day
taking
care
of
teams
cooking
etc
at
the
camp
proceeded
again
i
went
ahead
on
foot
about
one
quarter
of
a
mile
from
where
we
camped
is
one
of
the
prettiest
beds
of
nettle
i
have
seen
for
some
time
our
road
this
morning
lay
beside
pretty
heavy
timber
and
about
a
westerly
course
after
traveling
two
miles
crossed
looking
glass
creek
a
small
stream
about
a
rod
wide
but
easily
forded
i
still
went
ahead
on
foot
and
at
sat
down
on
an
indian
grave
on
top
of
a
mound
from
whence
is
a
splendid
view
of
the
surrounding
country
for
many
miles
from
southeast
to
southwest
you
can
see
the
course
of
the
loop
fork
for
a
number
of
miles
northwest
a
level
prairie
about
four
miles
and
then
a
range
of
timber
the
bluffs
on
the
north
about
seven
miles
distant
and
on
the
east
a
level
prairie
for
about
twenty
miles
at
this
place
there
is
a
range
of
what
appears
to
be
mounds
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
running
from
northeast
to
southwest
at
we
arrived
on
the
east
bank
of
beaver
river
having
traveled
about
ten
miles
this
stream
is
about
twenty
to
feet
wide
swift
clear
water
and
pleasant
tasting
the
banks
are
tolerably
well
lined
with
timber
here
we
stopped
to
feed
some
of
the
brethren
went
to
fix
the
fording
place
a
little
the
banks
are
steep
on
each
side
and
the
water
a
little
over
two
feet
deep
at
started
again
the
ox
teams
first
when
passing
the
river
a
number
of
the
brethren
stood
on
the
west
bank
with
a
long
rope
which
was
hooked
to
the
wagon
tongue
and
they
assisted
the
teams
up
the
bank
the
wagon
i
rode
in
crossed
at
two
minutes
after
and
in
a
little
while
all
were
safely
over
we
proceeded
on
till
half
past
five
when
we
arrived
at
the
pawnee
missionary
station
which
is
about
seven
miles
from
beaver
river
the
country
this
afternoon
was
more
uneven
there
being
many
steep
ditches
and
rises
the
grass
appears
longer
and
there
is
much
rosing
weed
the
soil
looks
black
and
no
doubt
would
yield
a
good
crop
of
corn
this
missionary
station
was
deserted
last
fall
and
brother
miller
company
being
camped
here
they
carried
the
missionaries
and
their
effects
to
bellview
on
the
missouri
river
this
is
a
very
beautiful
place
for
a
location
on
the
north
and
west
it
is
surrounded
by
bluffs
on
the
south
by
the
loop
fork
at
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
distance
on
the
east
by
descending
prairie
the
plumb
creek
runs
through
it
and
but
a
few
rods
from
the
missionaries
house
its
banks
are
lined
with
a
little
timber
there
is
also
a
steep
bank
on
each
side
and
between
these
banks
in
the
valley
which
is
a
few
rods
wide
the
sioux
have
practiced
coming
down
when
they
have
made
their
attacks
on
the
pawnees
the
ravine
is
certainly
well
calculated
to
shelter
an
enemy
from
observation
when
designing
to
make
a
sudden
attack
there
are
a
number
of
good
log
houses
here
considerable
land
under
improvement
enclosed
by
rail
fences
and
a
good
quantity
of
hay
and
fodder
large
lots
of
iron
old
and
new
several
plows
and
a
drag
all
apparently
left
to
rot
there
are
also
two
stoves
etc
the
government
station
is
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
or
south
where
father
case
lived
as
government
farmer
and
received
a
year
for
it
but
when
major
harvey
learned
at
the
last
payday
which
was
last
november
that
father
case
had
joined
the
mormons
he
very
politely
dismissed
him
from
the
government
service
the
sioux
came
down
sometime
ago
and
burned
up
the
government
station
houses
blacksmith
shop
and
everything
but
the
missionary
station
they
did
not
touch
this
place
according
to
my
account
is
miles
from
winter
quarters
and
a
lovely
place
to
live
before
dark
the
president
called
the
camp
together
and
told
them
they
might
use
the
fodder
and
hay
for
their
teams
but
forbade
any
man
carrying
anything
away
even
to
the
value
of
one
cent
he
said
he
had
no
fears
of
the
pawnees
troubling
us
here
but
we
had
better
be
prepared
lest
the
sioux
should
come
down
and
try
to
steal
horses
a
guard
was
selected
and
a
picket
guard
to
watch
the
ravine
to
the
north
the
cannon
was
also
prepared
and
brother
tanner
drilled
his
men
to
use
it
till
dark
at
i
retired
to
rest
and
slept
well
through
the
night
the
variation
of
the
compass
is
about
degrees
at
this
place
i
again
introduced
the
subject
of
fixing
machinery
to
a
wagon
wheel
to
tell
the
distance
we
travel
describing
the
machinery
and
time
it
would
take
to
make
it
several
caught
the
idea
and
feel
confident
of
its
success
friday
april
arose
this
morning
at
my
face
bad
again
through
sleeping
cold
the
air
chilly
but
a
very
pleasant
morning
president
young
heber
and
others
are
gone
to
the
river
to
ascertain
where
we
can
best
ford
it
there
is
a
ford
a
little
distance
from
here
and
another
about
four
miles
above
but
the
latter
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
another
band
of
the
pawnees
and
they
are
desirous
to
avoid
it
if
possible
they
started
out
on
horseback
at
a
quarter
to
eight
and
the
camp
remained
here
till
they
returned
some
are
working
some
fixing
wagons
etc
the
day
is
now
warm
and
very
pleasant
i
went
to
plumb
creek
and
washed
my
feet
which
are
very
sore
the
brethren
returned
at
a
quarter
to
and
reported
that
we
would
have
to
go
about
four
miles
and
there
build
a
raft
tarlton
lewis
was
appointed
to
superintend
the
building
of
the
raft
president
young
then
stated
in
regard
to
the
plows
iron
which
lies
around
here
for
the
government
is
owing
father
case
considerable
for
services
and
he
has
the
privilege
of
taking
this
for
his
pay
he
will
do
it
and
if
the
brethren
want
the
iron
they
can
have
by
hauling
it
one
half
and
father
case
the
other
half
and
he
case
will
write
and
inform
them
what
he
has
done
i
started
on
foot
about
and
viewed
the
ruins
of
buildings
which
the
sioux
have
burned
there
is
a
large
quantity
of
good
bar
iron
and
a
number
of
plows
which
the
brethren
put
into
their
wagons
on
the
terms
proposed
by
father
case
two
miles
from
plumb
creek
passed
another
creek
not
very
good
to
ford
although
it
is
narrow
but
sandy
two
miles
farther
arrived
at
the
intended
crossing
place
but
the
prospect
looks
dull
for
rafting
on
account
of
sandbars
and
very
rapid
current
my
feet
were
so
sore
and
blistered
i
could
not
walk
for
some
time
after
i
got
there
the
sun
is
very
hot
and
no
wind
at
the
wagons
arrived
and
prepared
to
ford
the
river
luke
johnson
was
the
first
who
went
over
leaving
the
boat
on
this
side
and
although
he
had
no
load
nor
even
a
wagon
box
it
was
with
difficulty
he
got
over
orson
pratt
started
next
with
a
part
of
his
load
when
he
had
got
in
about
a
rod
his
horses
began
to
sink
some
in
the
sand
and
they
could
not
draw
a
number
of
the
brethren
jumped
in
and
lifted
at
the
wheels
till
they
got
him
to
the
bar
in
the
middle
he
then
started
for
the
other
bar
and
about
half
way
across
his
horses
sank
in
the
quicksand
so
badly
that
one
of
them
fell
down
a
number
of
the
men
immediately
went
to
his
assistance
and
took
them
off
the
wagon
and
led
them
across
to
the
sand
bar
president
young
went
over
in
the
boat
and
took
the
loading
out
of
the
carriage
into
the
boat
the
carriage
was
drawn
to
the
sand
bar
by
men
with
a
long
rope
the
brethren
then
assisted
elder
woodruff
team
over
in
the
same
way
also
john
pack
and
wordsworth
president
young
then
ordered
that
no
more
wagons
should
go
over
that
way
but
move
up
the
river
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
camp
until
morning
the
camp
was
formed
about
the
river
is
not
more
than
two
feet
deep
but
there
are
a
great
many
beds
of
quicksand
which
are
dangerous
to
teams
and
calculated
to
shake
a
wagon
to
pieces
they
make
a
noise
when
crossing
the
quicksands
as
if
they
were
going
over
a
stone
pavement
the
country
here
is
indeed
beautiful
and
appears
rich
but
there
is
very
little
timber
after
crossing
plumb
creek
there
is
plowed
land
for
nearly
two
miles
on
the
right
but
not
fenced
it
appears
to
have
yielded
a
good
crop
of
corn
the
land
on
the
left
to
the
river
is
level
and
beautiful
for
a
farm
we
are
now
camped
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
old
pawnee
village
on
a
splendid
table
of
land
level
and
pleasant
as
heart
could
desire
it
is
not
much
over
three
quarters
of
a
mile
wide
and
shielded
on
the
north
by
beautiful
rolling
bluffs
and
on
the
south
by
the
loop
fork
of
the
platte
from
this
bank
can
be
seen
the
timber
on
the
banks
of
the
main
platte
the
bottom
from
here
to
it
appears
very
level
there
is
something
romantic
in
the
scenery
around
here
and
the
prospect
can
not
well
be
exaggerated
in
the
evening
the
captains
of
tens
were
called
together
and
a
vote
taken
to
build
two
light
rafts
tarlton
lewis
to
superintend
one
and
thomas
woolsey
the
other
as
many
loads
of
property
as
can
be
carried
over
in
the
boat
will
be
done
and
the
teams
with
empty
wagons
will
ford
it
it
is
said
that
by
going
over
several
times
with
teams
the
sand
will
pack
down
and
be
good
crossing
several
of
those
who
have
been
across
believe
this
from
today
experience
and
they
calculate
to
give
it
a
fair
trial
tomorrow
amongst
the
rest
of
those
who
waded
the
river
to
help
the
wagons
over
brother
kimball
joined
and
assisted
one
team
to
the
other
side
and
then
returned
in
the
boat
with
president
young
saturday
april
arose
soon
after
morning
fine
but
cool
one
of
phineas
horses
was
choked
to
death
last
night
it
appears
he
was
tied
to
a
stake
with
a
chain
near
a
steep
hole
in
the
ravine
and
either
stepped
back
or
lay
down
and
rolled
over
into
the
hole
and
the
chain
being
short
he
was
choked
to
death
having
no
power
to
extricate
himself
this
is
a
grievous
loss
for
there
are
no
more
teams
in
the
camp
than
what
are
absolutely
necessary
and
in
fact
there
are
hardly
enough
to
get
along
very
comfortably
by
request
of
brother
kimball
i
went
up
to
the
old
indian
village
immediately
after
breakfast
to
take
a
view
of
it
and
write
a
description
as
near
as
circumstances
would
permit
which
is
as
follows
this
village
is
situated
on
the
north
bank
of
the
loop
fork
of
the
nebraska
or
platte
river
about
four
miles
southwest
of
the
mission
station
on
plumb
creek
and
miles
from
winter
quarters
the
pawnee
nation
is
divided
into
four
bands
the
names
of
the
bands
are
the
grand
pawnee
the
loop
the
tappas
and
the
republican
when
the
nation
settled
in
this
region
the
grand
pawnees
and
the
tappas
located
on
the
west
bank
of
plumb
creek
and
the
loops
located
on
this
spot
and
were
afterwards
joined
by
the
republicans
when
the
sioux
made
war
on
the
indians
at
the
first
settlement
and
destroyed
their
village
the
grand
chief
saw
that
his
party
were
unable
to
cope
with
their
hostile
foes
alone
and
it
was
concluded
that
the
four
bands
should
locate
together
on
this
spot
but
notwithstanding
this
the
sioux
succeeded
in
burning
this
village
last
summer
during
the
absence
of
the
pawnees
when
on
their
hunt
they
rebuilt
most
of
it
again
but
last
fall
the
sioux
made
another
attack
and
burned
the
whole
village
except
one
dwelling
or
lodge
which
is
not
harmed
there
are
three
or
four
others
but
partially
destroyed
the
rest
are
entirely
demolished
and
levelled
with
the
ground
the
pawnees
then
moved
to
the
place
where
we
passed
them
a
few
days
ago
and
are
dwelling
in
their
lodges
made
of
hides
etc
the
name
of
the
grand
chief
is
shefmolan
who
is
also
the
superior
chief
of
the
pawnee
band
all
documents
or
treaties
made
by
the
nation
are
signed
by
this
chief
and
the
nation
is
then
bound
by
them
the
head
chief
of
the
loup
band
is
named
siscatup
the
other
chiefs
father
case
did
not
recollect
their
names
from
him
i
obtained
this
information
there
is
a
part
of
the
loup
band
on
the
main
platte
some
distance
from
here
who
have
never
yielded
to
the
government
treaties
but
stand
out
from
the
rest
of
the
nation
and
spend
their
time
mostly
in
plundering
other
tribes
as
well
as
travelers
they
frequently
go
as
far
as
the
cherokee
nation
to
rob
and
plunder
all
the
pawnee
nation
are
noted
for
their
love
of
plundering
travelers
of
their
horses
and
mules
but
not
often
anything
else
on
the
east
and
west
of
the
village
is
a
beautiful
level
bench
of
prairie
extending
many
miles
and
to
the
ridge
of
bluffs
which
run
east
and
west
touching
within
a
mile
of
the
village
on
the
top
of
the
bluffs
can
be
seen
a
number
of
indian
graves
to
the
northwest
about
a
mile
distant
and
at
the
foot
of
the
bluffs
is
an
extensive
corn
field
the
stalks
still
standing
on
the
south
is
a
beautiful
view
of
the
nice
level
prairie
extending
to
the
main
branch
of
the
platte
the
timber
on
the
banks
can
be
faintly
but
plainly
seen
the
loup
fork
is
probably
about
yards
wide
at
this
place
and
very
shoal
except
a
narrow
channel
near
the
shore
on
this
side
which
is
probably
three
feet
deep
the
bottom
is
mostly
quicksand
and
not
safe
fording
about
half
the
surface
from
bank
to
bank
is
sand
bars
which
appear
above
the
surface
of
the
water
mostly
on
the
south
side
there
are
several
small
islands
and
a
little
timber
to
the
right
or
west
the
village
occupies
a
space
of
about
acres
of
land
and
is
mostly
enclosed
by
a
ditch
about
five
feet
wide
and
a
bank
inside
the
ditch
about
four
feet
high
running
from
the
bank
of
the
river
around
the
village
till
it
again
strikes
the
bank
and
when
perfect
has
formed
a
good
fortification
a
number
of
lodges
are
built
outside
the
ditch
on
the
east
and
on
account
of
want
of
room
inside
when
the
bands
from
the
other
village
joined
them
the
village
is
composed
of
about
houses
or
lodges
varying
in
size
but
all
similarly
constructed
as
appears
from
the
remnants
of
some
left
standing
while
i
take
this
sketch
i
sit
in
the
one
left
unharmed
which
it
is
said
was
owned
by
the
chief
siscatup
and
as
the
lodges
are
all
constructed
in
the
same
manner
only
differing
in
size
i
will
endeavor
to
describe
the
way
in
which
this
is
built
in
the
first
place
the
earth
is
dug
out
a
little
slanting
to
the
depth
of
about
inches
in
the
form
of
a
perfect
circle
about
feet
in
diameter
this
forms
the
floor
of
the
dwelling
then
there
are
crotch
posts
let
into
the
floor
in
a
direction
slanting
outward
so
that
the
top
of
the
crotch
is
about
perpendicular
with
the
outside
of
the
circle
the
foot
being
set
about
or
inches
from
the
base
of
the
circle
these
posts
are
arranged
at
about
equal
distances
from
each
other
around
the
circle
in
the
crotches
poles
are
laid
across
from
crotch
to
crotch
and
are
sufficiently
high
for
the
tallest
man
to
stand
upright
under
them
at
the
distance
of
or
inches
from
the
outside
of
the
circle
are
many
smaller
poles
let
into
the
surface
of
the
ground
on
an
average
of
about
a
foot
apart
and
leaning
inward
so
that
the
top
of
the
poles
rest
on
the
cross
pieces
which
are
supported
by
the
crotches
the
space
between
the
foot
of
these
poles
and
the
edge
of
the
circle
forms
a
bench
for
seats
entirely
around
the
house
and
there
is
room
sufficient
for
more
than
a
hundred
men
to
seat
themselves
on
it
very
comfortably
on
the
outside
of
these
last
mentioned
poles
are
laid
a
number
of
still
smaller
poles
horizontally
from
bottom
to
top
from
about
inches
to
a
foot
apart
these
are
lashed
fast
to
the
upright
poles
by
strings
made
of
bark
on
the
outside
of
these
is
laid
a
thick
layer
of
long
prairie
grass
and
occasionally
lashed
through
to
the
upright
poles
also
the
whole
is
then
covered
with
earth
about
two
feet
in
thickness
at
the
bottom
and
gradually
thinner
towards
the
top
this
forms
an
enclosure
when
completed
around
the
whole
area
about
seven
feet
high
a
place
being
left
sufficiently
large
for
the
door
the
next
process
is
to
place
erect
ten
upright
poles
or
crotches
very
stout
being
about
a
foot
in
diameter
about
seven
feet
nearer
the
center
of
the
circle
than
the
first
crotches
these
are
set
perpendicular
deep
in
the
ground
and
also
arranged
at
about
equal
distances
from
each
other
and
form
a
strong
foundation
which
is
the
design
and
use
to
which
they
are
appropriated
on
the
top
of
these
pillars
are
also
horizontal
poles
laid
strong
and
firm
the
top
of
the
pillars
being
about
eleven
or
twelve
feet
above
the
floor
long
small
poles
are
then
laid
from
the
outside
horizontal
poles
over
the
inner
ones
and
sufficiently
long
to
meet
at
the
top
within
about
two
feet
of
each
other
forming
a
hole
for
the
smoke
from
the
fire
to
ascend
through
these
long
poles
are
laid
pretty
close
together
all
around
the
building
and
across
them
smaller
ones
are
lashed
with
bark
as
in
the
first
instance
only
they
are
much
closer
together
the
operation
of
lashing
on
a
layer
of
long
grass
and
finally
covering
the
whole
with
earth
completes
the
roof
of
the
building
the
door
or
entrance
is
a
long
porch
formed
by
placing
in
the
earth
four
upright
posts
or
crotches
far
enough
apart
to
extend
outwards
from
the
circle
about
or
feet
there
are
four
upright
crotches
on
each
side
the
porch
and
in
the
crotches
poles
are
laid
horizontally
as
in
the
other
parts
of
the
building
the
process
of
lashing
sticks
across
then
a
thick
coat
of
long
grass
and
lastly
a
stout
coat
of
earth
is
the
same
as
the
other
parts
of
the
building
the
roof
of
the
porch
is
flat
and
is
about
seven
feet
high
and
six
feet
wide
the
porch
is
dug
down
about
half
as
deep
as
the
main
building
making
a
short
step
at
the
mouth
of
the
porch
and
another
one
at
the
entrance
into
the
house
the
fire
has
been
made
in
the
center
of
the
house
directly
under
the
hole
in
the
roof
at
the
farther
side
of
the
building
exactly
opposite
the
porch
is
a
projection
of
sod
left
about
a
foot
from
the
outside
of
the
circle
which
is
said
to
have
been
the
seat
of
the
chief
and
over
which
hung
his
medicine
bag
and
other
implements
the
crotches
are
arranged
so
that
there
is
a
free
passage
to
the
center
of
the
hall
from
the
porch
one
standing
on
each
side
at
the
entrance
about
six
feet
apart
and
the
others
appear
to
be
arranged
from
them
the
smaller
houses
have
not
so
many
pillars
as
this
one
some
have
eight
in
the
center
and
sixteen
outside
the
circle
others
have
four
in
the
center
and
ten
outside
the
entrances
are
also
smaller
in
proportion
but
all
are
constructed
on
the
same
principle
it
looks
a
little
singular
to
note
that
nearly
all
the
entrances
to
these
lodges
front
to
the
southeast
except
in
one
or
two
instances
where
they
front
in
other
directions
for
lack
of
room
it
is
probable
that
this
is
done
to
avoid
the
effects
of
the
severe
cold
northwest
winds
so
prevalent
in
winter
adjacent
to
each
lodge
is
a
stable
or
pen
which
has
been
designed
for
keeping
horses
in
these
are
mostly
left
unharmed
they
are
constructed
by
placing
poles
upright
in
the
ground
from
two
to
three
inches
in
diameter
as
close
together
as
possible
and
about
ten
feet
high
about
five
or
six
feet
above
the
ground
cross
poles
are
laid
horizontally
and
each
of
the
upright
poles
are
firmly
lashed
to
the
cross
poles
by
strips
of
bark
so
as
to
make
them
firm
and
secure
them
from
being
moved
out
of
their
place
the
stables
are
mostly
built
square
with
a
door
left
on
one
side
sufficiently
large
to
admit
a
horse
there
are
some
circular
stables
but
not
so
many
as
the
square
ones
the
horses
appear
to
have
been
penned
in
by
placing
loose
poles
across
the
doorway
for
there
is
no
other
sign
of
a
door
visible
around
each
lodge
there
are
also
several
cachets
where
corn
and
other
necessities
are
deposited
the
cachets
are
large
holes
dug
in
the
ground
or
rather
under
the
ground
the
entrance
being
only
just
large
enough
to
admit
a
common
sized
man
they
are
made
pretty
much
after
the
shape
of
a
large
demijon
the
cachets
are
generally
about
six
feet
high
inside
and
about
fifteen
feet
in
diameter
there
is
a
gradual
slope
from
the
mouth
to
the
extreme
corner
and
a
little
bowing
which
forms
the
roof
the
surface
of
the
earth
above
at
the
mouth
is
about
two
and
a
half
or
three
feet
deep
some
of
these
are
said
to
be
capable
of
holding
a
hundred
bushels
of
corn
and
when
filled
there
is
a
thick
coat
of
grass
laid
on
the
top
and
the
mouth
then
filled
up
nicely
with
earth
and
when
finished
a
stranger
would
not
have
the
least
suspicion
that
there
was
a
storehouse
full
of
corn
under
his
feet
i
finished
taking
the
foregoing
sketch
soon
after
noon
and
then
had
intended
to
go
on
the
bluffs
and
examine
the
indian
graves
but
it
being
very
warm
and
perceiving
the
teams
crossing
the
river
very
rapidly
i
returned
and
found
most
of
the
teams
over
they
commenced
crossing
about
eight
some
unloaded
their
goods
on
the
bank
which
were
carried
in
the
boat
to
the
sand
bar
the
teams
going
down
to
the
ferry
to
cross
after
a
few
wagons
had
gone
over
it
was
perceived
that
they
went
over
with
less
difficulty
and
by
doubling
teams
they
soon
took
over
the
loaded
wagons
without
much
difficulty
i
prepared
to
wade
over
the
river
inasmuch
as
the
wagon
i
am
with
was
gone
over
and
in
fact
all
heber
wagons
were
over
except
one
but
jackson
redding
brought
me
porter
rockwell
horse
to
ride
over
and
i
mounted
and
proceeded
i
found
the
current
strong
indeed
and
about
as
much
as
a
horse
could
do
to
ford
it
without
a
load
i
soon
got
over
safe
and
wet
only
my
feet
at
the
last
wagon
was
over
on
the
solid
sand
bar
and
about
four
all
the
wagons
and
teams
were
safely
landed
on
the
bank
on
the
south
side
of
the
loop
fork
without
any
loss
or
accident
which
made
the
brethren
feel
thankful
indeed
a
little
before
four
the
wagons
started
on
to
find
a
better
place
to
camp
and
feed
for
our
teams
where
we
can
stay
comfortable
until
monday
and
give
the
teams
a
chance
to
rest
for
they
as
well
as
the
men
are
very
tired
by
wading
against
the
strong
current
on
the
quick
sand
the
bottom
land
on
this
side
is
more
sandy
than
on
the
other
side
but
the
grass
appears
higher
but
not
so
thick
on
the
ground
the
bluffs
on
the
other
side
look
beautiful
from
here
and
the
indian
graves
show
very
plain
we
went
on
about
three
miles
and
camped
beside
a
small
lake
near
the
river
i
traveled
this
on
foot
soon
as
we
arrived
porter
rockwell
discovered
that
there
were
many
sun
fish
in
the
lake
i
took
a
couple
of
hooks
and
lines
handed
some
to
him
and
went
to
fishing
myself
with
the
others
and
we
had
some
fine
sport
i
caught
a
nice
mess
which
brother
egan
cooked
for
supper
and
although
they
were
small
they
made
a
good
dish
many
of
the
brethren
caught
a
good
mess
each
brother
higbee
came
down
with
the
seine
and
made
two
hauls
but
caught
none
on
account
of
the
grass
in
the
bottom
of
the
lake
we
have
good
reasons
to
suspect
that
we
are
watched
by
the
indians
as
their
footsteps
have
been
seen
on
the
bluffs
south
apparently
very
fresh
but
the
guard
are
faithful
and
we
have
no
fear
the
cannon
was
prepared
again
so
as
to
be
ready
in
case
there
should
be
an
attack
evening
i
walked
over
to
orson
pratt
wagon
and
through
his
telescope
saw
jupiter
four
moons
very
distinctly
never
having
seen
them
before
i
went
over
to
my
wagon
and
looked
through
my
glass
and
could
see
them
with
it
but
not
so
distinct
as
with
orson
the
evening
was
very
fine
and
pleasant
about
ten
retired
to
rest
in
good
health
and
spirits
thankful
for
the
mercies
of
the
day
that
is
past
sunday
april
arose
soon
after
five
shaved
and
changed
some
of
my
clothing
the
morning
very
pleasant
wind
west
our
course
for
the
last
seven
miles
has
been
about
southwest
we
are
about
miles
from
the
main
branch
of
the
platte
river
and
it
is
said
that
if
we
travel
on
this
fork
one
hundred
miles
farther
we
shall
then
be
not
over
thirty
miles
from
the
main
branch
this
morning
saw
four
antelope
on
the
other
bank
of
the
river
about
a
mile
and
a
half
northwest
afternoon
elijah
newman
was
baptized
by
tarlton
lewis
in
the
lake
for
the
benefit
of
his
health
brother
newman
has
been
afflicted
with
the
black
scurvy
in
his
legs
and
has
not
been
able
to
walk
without
sticks
but
after
being
baptized
and
hands
laid
on
him
he
returned
to
his
wagon
without
any
kind
of
help
seemingly
much
better
soon
after
a
meeting
was
called
at
the
wagon
of
president
young
and
remarks
made
by
several
and
instructions
by
president
young
chiefly
in
reference
to
the
guard
and
the
folly
of
conforming
to
gentile
military
customs
on
an
expedition
of
this
nature
after
dark
the
twelve
and
some
others
met
together
opposite
the
president
wagon
to
select
men
to
go
a
hunting
buffalo
as
we
proceed
on
the
journey
it
was
ascertained
that
there
are
eight
horses
in
the
company
which
are
not
attached
to
teams
then
eight
men
were
selected
to
ride
on
horseback
thomas
woolsey
thomas
brown
john
brown
rockwell
john
higbee
joseph
mathews
then
there
were
selected
eleven
men
to
hunt
also
on
foot
john

young
tarlton

joseph
hancock
edmund
ellsworth
roswell
stevens
edson
whipple
barnabas
adams
benjamin
stewart
jackson
redding
and
eric
glines
it
was
also
voted
that
the
twelve
have
the
privilege
of
hunting
when
they
have
a
mind
to
after
some
remarks
and
cautions
in
regard
to
chasing
the
wild
buffalo
the
company
was
dismissed
and
i
retired
to
rest
soon
after
nine
the
evening
being
very
fine
and
pleasant
monday
april
this
morning
about
an
alarm
was
sounded
i
immediately
got
out
of
the
wagon
and
learned
that
three
of
the
guard
who
were
stationed
to
the
northeast
of
the
camp
had
discovered
some
indians
crawling
up
towards
the
wagons
they
first
received
alarm
from
the
motions
of
one
of
our
horses
and
noticing
this
they
went
towards
the
spot
and
listening
heard
something
rustle
in
the
grass
they
first
suspected
they
were
wolves
and
fired
at
them
only
one
gun
went
off
and
six
indians
sprang
up
and
ran
from
within
a
few
rods
of
where
they
stood
another
gun
was
then
fired
at
them
and
the
camp
alarmed
a
strong
guard
was
placed
all
around
and
a
charge
of
cannister
put
in
the
cannon
the
day
was
just
breaking
when
this
took
place
and
the
moon
had
just
gone
down
the
air
being
extremely
cold
and
fires
put
out
i
retired
into
the
wagon
till
morning
and
arose
again
at
half
past
five
after
daylight
the
footsteps
of
the
indians
could
be
plainly
seen
where
they
had
come
down
under
the
bank
and
sometimes
stepped
into
the
water
no
doubt
their
object
was
to
steal
horses
and
they
had
a
fair
privilege
if
the
guard
had
been
found
asleep
for
the
camp
was
only
formed
in
a
half
circle
and
some
horses
were
tied
outside
however
the
prompt
reception
they
met
with
will
have
a
tendency
to
show
them
that
we
keep
a
good
watch
and
may
deter
them
from
making
another
attempt
orders
were
given
for
the
tens
to
assemble
for
prayers
this
morning
instead
of
two
in
each
wagon
which
was
done
president
young
told
me
this
morning
that
as
soon
as
my
health
will
permit
he
wants
me
to
assist
brother
bullock
in
keeping
minutes
as
brother
bullock
is
hard
run
having
to
take
care
of
a
team
and
attend
to
other
chores
the
camp
started
out
about
i
started
at
on
foot
and
traveled
four
miles
then
waited
for
the
wagons
there
is
no
road
here
consequently
president
young
kimball
smith
lyman
and
others
went
ahead
on
horseback
to
point
out
the
road
the
horse
teams
traveled
first
to
break
the
strong
grass
so
that
it
will
not
hurt
the
oxen
feet
the
hunters
started
out
in
different
directions
keeping
only
a
few
miles
from
the
wagons
we
traveled
about
seven
miles
and
then
stopped
at
beside
a
few
little
holes
of
water
to
rest
and
feed
teams
etc
from
this
place
which
is
somewhat
elevated
can
be
seen
the
remains
of
an
old
village
or
indian
fort
over
the
river
about
northwest
from
here
the
country
looks
beautiful
somewhat
rolling
and
bounded
by
uneven
bluffs
the
land
looks
poor
and
sandy
the
sun
is
very
hot
and
not
much
wind
i
find
it
has
a
great
tendency
to
make
sore
lips
parched
up
and
feverish
at
all
the
wagons
were
on
the
way
again
we
traveled
about
seven
miles
we
crossed
two
slough
or
soft
places
though
not
very
bad
they
are
the
first
since
we
left
winter
quarters
the
roads
are
more
uneven
than
on
the
other
side
the
river
we
had
to
make
a
new
road
all
day
at
the
encampment
was
formed
on
the
east
banks
of
a
small
creek
with
a
very
gravelly
bottom
the
wagons
are
formed
in
a
deep
hollow
and
so
low
that
they
can
not
be
seen
at
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distance
there
is
no
fresh
grass
here
neither
has
the
old
grass
been
burnt
off
we
have
crossed
a
number
of
trails
today
which
some
say
are
buffalo
trails
they
all
run
towards
the
river
and
in
some
places
there
are
or
others
not
more
than
two
and
so
on
together
running
about
a
half
a
yard
apart
the
hunters
have
seen
no
buffalo
woolsey
killed
a
goose
there
is
no
timber
here
only
a
few
small
willows
we
are
about
a
half
a
mile
from
the
river
and
there
does
seem
to
be
much
timber
on
the
river
our
course
today
has
been
about
southwest
about
a
mile
back
from
this
place
situated
on
a
high
bench
of
land
on
the
banks
of
the
river
is
the
remains
of
an
indian
village
the
houses
or
lodges
being
all
down
and
no
appearance
of
timber
left
the
entrances
to
these
lodges
all
face
to
the
southeast
the
same
as
those
back
at
the
other
village
there
has
evidently
been
a
garden
around
the
village
as
the
land
has
been
broken
and
bears
marks
of
cultivation
this
morning
brother
benson
discovered
that
one
of
the
iron
axles
of
his
wagon
was
broken
and
he
moved
the
load
so
that
there
was
no
weight
on
the
part
which
was
broken
and
traveled
with
it
all
day
this
evening
the
wagon
was
unloaded
the
axle
taken
off
brother
tanner
forge
set
up
and
the
axle
welded
and
fixed
ready
to
put
to
the
wagon
again
this
was
done
in
the
short
space
of
one
hour
after
the
encampment
was
formed
the
welding
was
performed
by
brother
burr
fost
about
eight
joseph
mathews
came
into
camp
from
seeking
his
horses
and
stated
that
an
indian
had
rode
a
horse
off
a
little
before
and
he
supposed
it
was
brother
little
horse
which
was
missing
richards
mare
was
also
missing
brother
mathews
stated
that
he
went
out
to
seek
for
his
black
man
who
was
out
watching
his
teams
and
as
he
arrived
he
saw
brother
little
horse
as
he
supposed
going
towards
the
river
he
ran
towards
it
to
turn
it
back
to
camp
but
as
soon
as
he
commenced
running
the
horse
sprang
to
a
gallop
which
made
him
suppose
there
was
an
indian
on
him
although
he
could
not
see
the
indian
as
soon
as
he
gave
the
alarm
five
or
six
of
the
brethren
mounted
their
horses
and
pursued
on
the
course
pointed
out
to
the
river
but
could
neither
see
nor
hear
a
horse
or
indian
when
they
returned
president
young
and
kimball
and
a
number
of
others
went
out
on
horseback
and
searched
till
near
eleven
but
likewise
proved
unsuccessful
the
brethren
have
been
repeatedly
warned
not
to
let
their
horses
go
far
from
their
wagons
but
every
time
we
stop
they
can
be
seen
around
for
more
than
two
miles
these
are
two
good
horses
and
the
owners
feel
bad
enough
but
it
will
be
a
warning
to
others
to
be
more
careful
tuesday
april
arose
soon
after
five
the
morning
fine
and
pleasant
during
the
night
the
guard
fired
twice
but
they
supposed
they
were
wolves
they
fired
at
i
went
back
to
the
old
indian
village
before
breakfast
and
also
with
rockwell
to
see
if
any
tracks
of
the
lost
horses
could
be
found
he
followed
one
track
some
way
into
a
bunch
of
willows
but
having
no
arms
we
returned
at
the
wagons
commenced
moving
and
traveled
till
being
about
twelve
miles
nearly
a
south
course
the
design
being
to
go
to
the
main
branch
of
the
platte
president
young
kimball
and
others
went
forward
again
to
point
out
the
road
rockwell
and
some
others
started
back
to
hunt
the
horses
about
the
time
we
started
the
land
today
has
been
very
rolling
and
uneven
it
is
also
very
sandy
and
dry
after
traveling
about
four
miles
through
dead
grass
we
found
a
large
space
where
the
grass
had
been
burned
off
here
it
is
quite
green
and
there
are
quantities
of
buffalo
dung
which
proves
that
we
are
not
far
distant
from
some
of
them
the
hunters
have
been
out
again
but
have
not
discovered
any
there
are
a
great
many
lizards
on
these
sand
ridges
but
they
are
of
a
small
size
president
young
and
kimball
discovered
a
dog
town
a
piece
back
and
many
little
prairie
dogs
in
one
hole
was
a
very
large
rattlesnake
and
around
the
holes
many
small
owls
which
seem
to
correspond
with
what
travelers
have
said
previously
that
the
prairie
dog
rattlesnakes
and
owls
all
live
in
the
same
hole
together
the
sun
is
very
hot
but
there
is
a
nice
west
wind
although
it
is
dry
and
parches
our
lips
when
we
stopped
at
noon
the
brethren
dug
several
holes
and
obtained
a
little
water
as
there
is
none
here
above
the
surface
they
could
not
obtain
any
for
the
cattle
and
horses
at
the
teams
commenced
to
move
again
just
as
they
started
john
brown
roswell
stevens
and
brother
woodruff
all
shot
at
an
antelope
they
all
hit
him
and
killed
him
having
skinned
it
they
put
it
into
one
of
the
wagons
the
afternoon
was
very
hot
and
the
roads
very
dusty
after
traveling
about
two
miles
some
of
the
ox
teams
gave
out
and
had
to
stop
and
feed
the
rest
went
on
till
they
found
a
small
branch
of
water
and
the
grass
being
very
good
we
stopped
for
the
night
at
half
past
five
having
traveled
about
four
miles
course
about
south
president
young
and
several
others
went
back
with
mules
and
horses
to
assist
the
teams
up
which
are
behind
luke
johnson
shot
a
very
large
rattlesnake
and
brought
it
to
camp
for
the
oil
roswell
stevens
killed
a
hare
the
nearest
like
the
english
hare
of
any
i
have
seen
in
this
country
soon
after
we
arrived
here
it
began
to
lightning
and
thunder
and
we
had
a
light
shower
with
a
very
strong
wind
there
is
an
appearance
of
more
rain
which
is
very
much
needed
indeed
at
rockwell
joseph
mathews
john
eldridge
and
thomas
brown
returned
from
hunting
the
two
lost
horses
they
reported
that
they
went
back
to
within
about
two
miles
of
where
we
encamped
on
sunday
and
looking
off
towards
the
river
they
saw
something
move
in
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
a
high
mole
they
proceeded
towards
it
thinking
it
was
a
wolf
when
within
about
twelve
or
fourteen
rods
porter
stopped
to
shoot
at
the
supposed
wolf
the
moment
he
elevated
his
rifle
fifteen
indians
sprang
to
their
feet
all
naked
except
the
breech
cloth
and
armed
with
rifles
and
bows
and
arrows
each
man
having
a
rifle
slung
on
his
back
and
his
bow
strung
tight
in
his
hand
and
about
twenty
arrows
the
indians
advanced
towards
them
but
the
brethren
motioned
and
told
them
to
stop
and
held
their
rifles
and
pistols
ready
to
meet
them
when
the
indians
saw
this
they
began
to
holler
bacco
bacco
the
brethren
told
them
they
had
not
tobacco
one
of
the
indians
came
close
beside
mathew
horse
to
shake
hands
with
mathews
but
kept
his
eye
on
the
horse
bridle
when
nearly
within
reach
of
the
bridle
brown
cocked
his
pistol
and
pointed
at
the
indian
shouting
if
he
did
not
leave
he
would
kill
him
at
which
the
indian
seeing
the
pistol
ready
to
fire
retreated
the
indians
made
signs
to
get
the
brethren
lower
down
the
river
but
the
brethren
turned
their
horses
to
come
to
camp
thinking
it
unsafe
to
go
near
to
the
timber
where
they
expected
more
indians
lay
in
ambush
when
the
brethren
turned
to
come
back
the
indians
fired
six
shots
at
them
with
their
rifles
and
the
brethren
immediately
faced
about
at
which
the
indians
fled
towards
the
timber
below
the
brethren
did
not
shoot
at
the
indians
even
when
the
indians
shot
at
them
they
saw
the
tracks
of
the
horses
which
are
missing
and
returned
satisfied
that
pawnees
have
got
them
and
no
doubt
intended
to
get
the
horses
on
which
the
brethren
rode
but
they
met
with
too
stern
a
reception
to
risk
an
attempt
some
of
these
same
indians
were
amongst
those
who
came
into
camp
when
we
stopped
for
dinner
near
their
village
and
proves
that
they
eyed
the
horses
pretty
close
and
also
proves
that
they
have
followed
us
close
ever
since
the
brethren
ran
great
risks
indeed
but
got
back
safe
to
camp
without
harm
about
the
same
time
the
brethren
returned
a
gun
accidentally
went
off
and
broke
the
nigh
fore
leg
of
brother
mathew
horse
those
who
saw
the
accident
state
that
when
the
rain
came
on
some
of
the
men
put
their
guns
in
john
brown
wagon
loaded
and
with
the
caps
on
brother
brown
threw
his
coat
on
the
guns
and
soon
after
went
to
get
his
coat
and
plucking
it
up
some
part
of
the
coat
caught
the
cock
of
the
gun
and
raised
it
so
that
when
the
coat
slipped
off
the
gun
went
off
and
the
ball
struck
the
horse
leg
on
the
back
side
about
half
way
between
the
knee
and
upper
joint
the
bone
was
broke
entirely
off
there
were
several
men
and
horses
close
by
the
wagon
at
the
time
the
wagon
was
set
on
fire
but
soon
put
out
with
little
damage
this
makes
four
of
the
best
horses
lost
within
the
last
four
days
but
the
last
circumstance
is
by
far
the
most
painful
and
breaks
up
brother
markham
team
brother
brown
made
heber
a
present
of
a
little
antelope
meat
about
dark
the
wind
moved
to
the
north
and
blew
strong
a
little
while
and
we
had
a
little
more
rain
wednesday
april
morning
fine
and
pleasant
no
indians
the
wind
blew
strong
from
the
northeast
which
makes
it
much
cooler
there
are
many
wolves
and
antelope
around
here
but
no
buffalo
have
been
seen
as
yet
orders
were
given
this
morning
for
no
man
to
leave
the
wagons
except
the
hunters
the
brethren
had
to
make
a
road
down
to
the
small
creek
near
which
we
camped
this
occupied
till
about
nine
when
the
wagons
commenced
crossing
the
last
wagon
crossed
at
ten
and
then
the
camp
proceeded
on
president
young
kimball
and
several
others
going
before
to
point
out
the
road
while
the
wagons
were
crossing
the
creek
brother
luke
johnson
shot
the
horse
dead
which
had
his
leg
broke
last
night
the
horse
belonged
to
brother
barney
but
was
in
markham
team
and
was
a
good
one
but
they
concluded
it
was
better
to
shoot
her
than
leave
her
alone
to
the
mercy
of
the
indians
our
course
for
the
first
seven
miles
was
a
little
east
of
south
over
a
very
level
prairie
and
green
with
grass
the
largest
wild
onions
grow
here
i
have
ever
seen
after
traveling
about
seven
miles
we
turned
southwest
being
within
a
mile
of
the
main
platte
and
opposite
to
grand
island
we
traveled
till
and
then
stopped
to
feed
having
come
about
eleven
miles
today
the
roads
are
extremely
dusty
and
the
strong
wind
blows
it
into
the
wagons
and
everything
is
covered
we
are
now
near
to
timber
and
a
good
chance
for
grass
for
the
cattle
at
we
moved
again
and
traveled
till
six
having
traveled
about
four
miles
and
during
the
day
about
fifteen
miles
we
have
camped
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
timber
and
there
is
plenty
of
grass
to
fill
the
stock
tonight
the
water
is
also
clear
and
cool
and
good
tasting
the
evening
is
cloudy
and
very
cool
which
affects
my
head
some
suppered
on
some
antelope
and
went
to
bed
early
thursday
april
the
wagons
started
at
five
this
morning
before
breakfast
to
find
more
grass
as
this
is
all
eaten
off
we
traveled
till
being
about
three
miles
and
then
turned
out
the
teams
to
feed
the
morning
very
cool
there
seems
to
be
very
little
rain
in
this
country
and
no
dew
breakfasted
on
goose
and
mouldy
bread
at
twenty
minutes
after
eight
the
teams
started
again
and
after
traveling
about
two
miles
came
to
a
very
pretty
stream
of
good
water
wood
river
about
ten
feet
wide
on
an
average
but
at
the
fording
place
about
a
rod
wide
we
were
detained
some
here
but
all
got
over
safely
we
then
traveled
on
a
table
or
prairie
gently
ascending
for
four
or
five
miles
but
very
even
and
good
traveling
at
we
stopped
beside
a
small
lake
to
rest
and
feed
teams
having
traveled
about
ten
miles
today
the
wind
south
and
strong
one
of
orson
pratt
horses
is
very
sick
supposed
to
be
the
bots
he
has
lain
down
several
times
in
the
harness
within
the
last
three
hours
i
am
not
astonished
as
the
wagons
and
everything
else
is
shrinking
up
for
the
wind
is
perfectly
dry
and
parching
there
is
no
moisture
in
it
even
my
writing
desk
is
splitting
with
the
drought
at
we
started
again
and
traveled
till
about
over
tolerable
level
prairie
distance
about
eight
miles
and
nearly
a
southwest
course
the
wind
was
strong
from
southwest
till
sundown
and
then
turned
to
northeast
the
clouds
of
dust
were
almost
sufficient
to
suffocate
everyone
i
rode
heber
horse
this
afternoon
and
went
before
the
wagons
saw
many
antelope
and
the
brethren
had
a
good
chance
to
kill
one
but
they
missed
it
although
three
of
them
shot
at
it
we
camped
at
night
close
to
grand
island
where
there
is
an
abundance
of
rushes
for
cattle
there
is
also
a
white
substance
that
seems
to
ooze
out
of
the
ground
around
here
and
tastes
like
salt
but
not
so
strong
as
common
salt
brother
orson
pratt
horse
is
better
and
the
day
has
passed
without
accident
friday
april
arose
at
half
past
five
morning
cool
and
pleasant
the
teams
have
filled
themselves
with
rushes
started
at
and
soon
after
the
camp
started
i
started
ahead
on
foot
and
have
traveled
about
five
miles
the
prairie
level
and
green
with
grass
we
travel
on
the
first
bench
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
north
of
the
timber
on
grand
island
there
are
many
wild
geese
on
the
prairie
also
buffalo
dung
but
none
very
recent
there
are
immense
patches
of
blue
grass
which
from
appearances
the
buffalo
are
fond
of
there
are
also
numerous
patches
of
buffalo
grass
which
is
very
short
thick
on
the
ground
and
curly
like
the
hair
on
a
buffalo
hide
and
much
resembling
it
except
in
color
about
a
mile
from
where
we
camped
last
night
we
passed
a
place
where
the
indians
have
camped
no
doubt
during
their
hunt
they
must
have
been
very
numerous
for
their
camp
has
covered
a
number
of
acres
of
ground
president
young
kimball
and
lyman
are
gone
ahead
on
horseback
to
look
out
the
road
we
have
thus
far
followed
the
indian
trail
but
it
is
now
so
grown
over
and
so
old
it
is
scarce
discernible
the
wind
blows
strong
from
the
north
and
the
dust
is
very
bad
the
atmosphere
is
dull
and
cloudy
our
course
today
has
been
about
west
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
we
stopped
to
feed
beside
a
small
creek
of
clear
good
water
having
traveled
about
eight
miles
the
grass
along
this
creek
is
long
and
plentiful
we
are
about
a
half
a
mile
from
grand
island
having
the
privilege
of
copying
from
brother
bullock
journal

at
twenty
minutes
after
ten
started
again
the
wind
blowing
from
the
north
tremendously
strong
and
clouds
of
dust
arose
from
under
the
wagon
wheels
it
has
turned
very
cold
and
gloomy
we
traveled
again
over
a
level
prairie
some
distance
from
the
river
and
turned
off
to
camp
under
the
bench
soon
after
having
traveled
about
eight
miles
our
course
a
little
southwest
the
wagons
were
formed
in
an
imperfect
circle
in
such
a
manner
as
to
have
all
the
wagon
mouths
from
the
wind
which
took
near
an
hour
to
form
the
encampment
we
are
about
a
mile
from
water
and
a
mile
and
a
half
from
timber
with
very
little
grass
for
our
teams
it
is
now
so
cold
that
every
man
wants
his
overcoat
on
and
a
buffalo
robe
over
it
we
have
had
no
accident
and
the
brethren
feel
well
some
are
wrestling
to
keep
themselves
warm
some
have
had
the
good
luck
to
bring
a
little
wood
with
them
but
it
seems
as
if
many
will
have
a
cold
supper
and
some
perhaps
little
or
nothing
as
they
have
no
bread
cooked
eight
the
camp
have
found
a
good
substitute
for
wood
in
the
dried
buffalo
dung
which
lies
on
the
ground
here
in
great
plenty
and
makes
a
good
fire
when
properly
managed
brother
kimball
invented
a
new
way
of
building
a
fire
to
cook
on
and
which
is
well
adapted
to
the
use
of
this
kind
of
fuel
he
dug
a
hole
in
the
ground
about
inches
deep
inches
long
and
inches
wide
then
at
each
end
of
this
hole
he
dug
another
about
the
same
dimensions
as
the
first
leaving
about
inches
of
earth
standing
between
the
middle
and
two
end
holes
at
the
end
of
these
partitions
he
made
a
hole
through
about
inches
in
diameter
to
serve
as
a
draught
in
the
bottom
of
the
middle
hole
the
fire
and
fuel
was
placed
and
across
the
top
two
wagon
hammers
to
set
the
pots
and
pans
on
so
that
the
fire
could
have
free
circulation
underneath
by
this
method
much
cooking
was
done
with
very
little
fuel
to
save
the
trouble
of
carrying
water
so
far
a
well
was
dug
in
a
short
time
about
feet
deep
and
good
water
obtained
after
supper
i
went
and
gathered
some
dried
buffalo
dung
politely
called
buffalo
chips
to
cook
with
in
the
morning
brother
hanson
played
some
on
his
violin
and
some
of
the
brethren
danced
to
warm
themselves
i
went
to
bed
early
to
get
warm
but
having
only
one
quilt
for
covering
i
suffered
much
with
cold
brother
kimball
rode
ahead
again
on
horseback
and
suffered
some
from
cold
may
saturday
may
the
morning
very
cold
indeed
inasmuch
as
there
is
little
grass
for
the
cattle
the
camp
started
out
at
and
traveled
till
a
quarter
after
eight
six
miles
before
breakfast
soon
after
we
started
this
morning
three
buffalo
were
seen
grazing
on
the
bluff
about
six
miles
distance
i
could
see
them
very
plain
with
my
glass
rockwell
thomas
brown
and
luke
johnson
started
on
horseback
to
try
to
kill
some
soon
after
they
went
another
herd
of
buffalo
were
seen
to
the
northwest
at
the
foot
of
the
bluffs
about
eight
miles
off
i
counted
with
my
glass
and
orson
pratt
counted
three
of
the
brethren
went
on
their
horses
after
the
latter
herd
i
watched
the
movement
with
the
glass
and
saw
that
sometime
before
the
brethren
got
to
them
the
buffalo
fled
and
were
soon
after
out
of
sight
we
stopped
for
breakfast
close
to
grand
island
and
at
proceeded
again
after
traveling
four
miles
we
arrived
at
a
small
lake
on
our
right
at
twelve
which
evidently
connects
with
the
river
in
high
water
a
little
previous
to
this
time
the
hunters
returned
and
reported
that
luke
johnson
shot
at
one
and
dropped
him
on
his
knees
but
he
got
up
again
and
ran
after
the
herd
they
did
not
get
any
but
saw
more
farther
west
and
went
to
give
chase
to
the
latter
herd
when
they
got
near
them
they
turned
down
under
the
bluffs
and
joined
the
herd
chased
by
the
last
hunting
party
luke
lost
his
cap
and
could
not
find
it
again
brother
higbee
said
he
could
have
shot
one
but
woolsey
told
him
to
hold
on
and
pick
out
a
good
one
they
being
pretty
near
selected
a
cow
and
designed
both
to
shoot
at
her
but
while
they
were
making
their
plans
the
herd
started
and
they
missed
their
chance
about
the
time
the
hunters
returned
another
still
larger
herd
was
discovered
still
farther
west
also
at
the
foot
of
the
bluffs
the
president
stopped
near
the
above
mentioned
lake
and
selected
eleven
men
to
go
and
give
chase
to
the
last
seen
herd
and
he
gave
them
their
instructions
although
they
were
at
least
eight
miles
from
us
i
distinctly
counted
with
my
glass
and
amongst
them
many
calves
this
being
the
first
day
buffalo
has
been
seen
on
our
journey
and
in
fact
the
first
ever
seen
by
any
except
about
five
or
six
of
the
brethren
it
excited
considerable
interest
and
pleasure
in
the
breasts
of
the
brethren
and
as
may
be
guessed
the
teams
moved
slowly
and
frequently
stopped
to
watch
their
movement
when
the
hunters
were
within
a
mile
or
two
from
the
herd
two
of
the
dogs
gave
chase
to
an
antelope
which
made
directly
towards
the
buffalo
one
of
the
dogs
chased
it
till
it
went
into
the
midst
of
the
herd
and
when
the
buffalo
saw
the
dog
they
commenced
to
canter
into
a
closer
huddle
the
dog
however
evidently
frightened
with
their
savage
appearance
stopped
and
retraced
his
steps
about
this
time
elder
kimball
seemed
to
get
inspired
with
the
idea
of
chasing
the
buffalo
and
he
immediately
called
for
egan
fifteen
shooter
and
started
with
it
on
full
gallop
after
the
dog
returned
the
buffalo
did
not
move
much
from
the
place
and
the
hunters
moved
gently
along
till
they
got
pretty
near
them
at
which
time
heber
joined
just
as
the
herd
discovered
them
and
commenced
galloping
off
the
brethren
feelings
who
were
left
with
the
wagons
were
now
strung
up
to
the
highest
pitch
a
feeling
of
exciting
interest
appeared
to
prevail
throughout
the
camp
they
having
heard
and
read
so
much
of
the
mad
ferocity
of
the
buffalo
when
hotly
pursued
and
knowing
that
all
the
hunters
were
inexperienced
in
regard
to
hunting
the
wild
buffalo
while
they
felt
for
the
safety
of
the
hunters
they
still
desired
to
see
as
much
of
the
chase
as
the
distance
would
allow
and
were
wishful
that
the
chase
might
be
successful
as
a
number
have
no
meat
and
a
piece
of
fresh
meat
would
taste
good
to
all
men
and
save
our
bread
stuff
and
the
desire
to
taste
the
much
famed
buffalo
meat
created
a
longing
desire
to
see
some
of
the
herd
fall
soon
as
the
herd
commenced
galloping
off
the
hunters
followed
in
pursuit
at
full
gallop
and
soon
closed
in
with
them
at
this
time
i
got
my
glass
and
rested
it
on
brother
aaron
farr
shoulder
determined
to
see
as
much
of
the
chase
as
possible
i
soon
discovered
rockwell
ride
into
the
midst
of
the
herd
which
then
appeared
to
number
over
others
having
come
in
sight
when
the
herd
commenced
to
run
porter
was
soon
enveloped
in
the
cloud
of
dust
caused
by
the
heavy
tramp
of
the
buffalo
on
the
dry
sandy
ground
but
in
a
very
short
time
the
herd
began
to
separate
and
scatter
in
every
direction
a
small
party
coming
down
the
bluff
again
and
some
running
west
under
the
bluffs
others
going
over
the
hunters
closed
in
on
the
first
party
and
commenced
their
fire
especially
at
one
cow
which
they
finally
succeeded
in
separating
from
all
the
rest
and
determined
to
keep
to
her
until
they
killed
her
except
porter
who
as
soon
as
he
had
wounded
her
left
her
with
the
hunters
and
pursued
some
of
the
rest
the
cow
was
now
in
close
quarters
and
after
she
had
been
shot
through
two
or
three
times
elder
kimball
rode
close
to
her
with
his
fifteen
shooter
and
fired
over
his
horse
head
she
dropped
helpless
and
was
soon
dispatched
at
the
report
of
the
gun
which
was
very
heavy
loaded
elder
kimball
horse
sprang
and
flew
down
the
bluff
like
lightning
and
he
having
let
go
the
lines
to
shoot
her
sudden
motion
overbalanced
him
and
his
situation
was
precarious
to
the
extreme
the
other
hunters
saw
his
situation
and
trembled
for
his
safety
but
could
render
him
no
assistance
however
being
a
good
horseman
he
maintained
his
position
in
the
saddle
and
soon
succeeded
in
gaining
the
lines
and
by
a
vigorous
effort
succeeded
after
some
time
in
reining
in
his
horse
and
returned
to
the
rest
unharmed
and
without
accident
all
this
movement
passed
about
as
quick
as
thought
and
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
cow
dead
and
all
right
they
again
followed
in
pursuit
of
the
remaining
buffalo
about
this
time
three
of
the
herd
separated
from
the
rest
and
came
in
a
direction
towards
the
camp
on
a
gallop
president
young
seeing
this
ordered
a
halt
and
the
wagons
to
get
close
together
lest
the
buffalo
should
in
their
fury
and
excitement
venture
to
go
between
the
wagons
and
do
much
mischief
however
they
were
discovered
by
some
of
the
hunters
nearer
the
camp
and
some
foot
men
who
gave
chase
to
them
changed
their
course
when
within
about
a
mile
from
the
camp
at
this
time
i
had
a
very
good
view
of
their
shape
color
and
appearance
when
running
which
i
shall
endeavor
to
describe
hereafter
elder
kimball
arrived
in
time
to
aid
in
the
chase
of
these
three
which
lasted
some
time
the
hunters
made
choice
of
a
large
and
very
furious
bull
and
worked
with
him
some
time
shooting
him
through
several
times
but
all
this
did
not
seem
to
impede
his
progress
rockwell
said
he
had
heard
it
said
that
a
buffalo
could
not
be
hurt
with
a
ball
shot
at
his
head
having
a
fair
chance
with
this
one
he
determined
to
satisfy
himself
and
previous
to
his
being
wounded
gaining
a
little
in
advance
came
right
in
front
within
about
a
rod
of
him
and
discharged
his
rifle
pistol
which
struck
the
center
of
his
head
but
with
no
other
effect
than
to
make
it
smoke
a
little
some
dust
fly
and
the
raving
animal
shake
savagely
the
brethren
john
higbee
and
john
pack
soon
after
succeeded
in
dropping
him
and
laid
him
dead
at
their
feet
john
pack
being
the
one
that
dropped
him
during
all
this
other
scenes
were
passing
of
equal
interest
one
of
the
calves
was
discovered
within
a
few
rods
of
the
wagons
a
shot
fired
at
it
and
it
was
soon
caught
by
the
dogs
killed
and
put
into
a
feed
box
porter
chased
another
calf
to
within
a
mile
of
the
camp
previous
to
his
chasing
the
bull
some
of
the
footmen
surrounded
and
dispatched
it
and
soon
after
brought
and
put
it
in
one
of
the
wagons
other
brethren
were
still
away
at
the
bluffs
but
we
had
no
certainty
of
their
success
until
elder
kimball
john
pack
and
several
others
came
up
to
the
camp
after
dispatching
the
bull
and
reported
two
other
cows
killed
and
three
calves
this
was
a
little
before
when
it
was
ascertained
for
a
certainty
that
one
was
killed
the
revenue
cutter
was
unloaded
and
sent
to
fetch
it
to
camp
it
was
reported
that
two
other
cows
and
three
calves
were
killed
when
elder
kimball
and
others
came
up
to
the
camp
president
young
requested
some
of
the
brethren
to
unload
their
wagons
and
go
and
fetch
the
others
reported
to
be
killed
while
the
wagons
would
strike
towards
the
river
and
camp
for
the
night
the
chase
lasted
from
soon
after
until
soon
four
wagons
were
unloaded
the
brethren
having
their
loads
on
the
ground
in
care
of
a
guard
and
were
ready
to
start
out
having
a
great
desire
to
see
a
buffalo
in
his
natural
state
my
feet
being
very
sore
and
the
distance
to
the
bluffs
being
over
three
miles
i
got
into
brother
aaron
farr
wagon
he
being
one
who
unloaded
to
fetch
in
the
meat
and
we
started
for
the
one
shot
down
by
elder
kimball
he
and
rockwell
following
on
horseback
on
our
route
we
met
luke
johnson
and
two
other
hunters
returning
luke
had
a
calf
tied
on
his
horse
himself
on
foot
when
we
arrived
at
the
cow
we
found
that
three
of
the
brethren
had
come
on
foot
and
had
already
got
the
hide
off
except
the
head
she
was
soon
cut
in
two
put
in
the
wagon
with
the
rest
of
the
meat
hide
and
head
and
we
started
for
the
next
cow
which
was
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
distant
this
cow
would
probably
weigh
on
foot
about
pounds
she
was
not
very
fat
but
the
meat
looked
nice
and
clean
when
we
arrived
at
the
next
cow
we
found
several
of
the
brethren
at
work
with
her
they
had
got
her
hide
off
and
soon
had
her
in
the
wagon
we
then
proceeded
to
camp
and
got
in
soon
after
sundown
the
meat
was
unloaded
in
the
opposite
the
president
wagon
and
placed
on
the
hide
which
was
spread
on
the
ground
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
it
clean
the
faces
beamed
with
joy
to
see
the
meat
begin
to
come
into
camp
and
with
some
astonishment
to
view
the
size
and
ferocious
appearance
of
the
head
which
still
had
the
hide
on
soon
after
the
other
wagons
came
in
and
each
deposited
its
load
in
the
same
place
joseph
mathews
came
in
about
the
same
time
and
reported
that
he
had
killed
another
calf
after
chasing
it
three
miles
making
the
total
number
killed
in
the
first
day
buffalo
hunt
by
the
camp
of
the
saints
already
reported
as
follows
one
bull
three
cows
and
six
calves
a
circumstance
far
exceeding
our
expectations
and
best
hopes
and
all
without
the
slightest
accident
or
loss
to
man
or
property
except
luke
johnson
cap
and
a
ramrod
to
a
rifle
there
is
however
one
shade
of
suspense
caused
by
the
intelligence
that
joseph
hancock
has
not
returned
to
camp
he
started
out
on
foot
when
the
three
buffalo
were
first
discovered
this
morning
and
has
not
been
seen
or
heard
of
for
sometime
considerable
fear
is
entertained
for
his
safety
from
the
fact
that
he
is
lame
and
it
is
evident
or
at
least
considered
so
that
there
are
indians
near
because
a
large
smoke
as
of
prairie
burning
has
been
seen
all
the
afternoon
within
some
six
or
eight
miles
to
the
west
and
must
have
been
set
on
fire
by
somebody
and
the
probability
is
it
is
indians
although
none
has
been
seen
for
several
days
the
meat
was
cut
up
into
quarters
and
distributed
one
quarter
to
each
company
of
ten
leaving
some
to
be
distributed
in
the
morning
and
in
a
short
time
every
fire
was
loaded
with
it
and
the
camp
had
a
good
feast
on
the
fruits
of
today
labors
soon
after
the
hunters
started
out
at
noon
we
came
to
a
long
range
of
dog
towns
and
saw
many
of
the
little
prairie
dogs
playing
around
their
holes
the
extent
of
this
dog
town
is
yet
unknown
for
we
have
traveled
over
and
parallel
with
it
about
five
miles
this
afternoon
and
they
seem
to
extend
still
farther
west
in
some
places
the
town
is
nearly
two
miles
broad
in
others
not
so
much
and
must
contain
thousands
of
the
little
dogs
i
could
not
get
near
enough
to
see
their
form
distinctly
for
they
are
so
quick
into
their
holes
when
anything
approaches
you
can
only
have
a
partial
view
of
them
they
appear
to
be
about
as
long
as
a
common
grey
squirrel
but
more
chunky
a
larger
body
and
chubbed
head
the
tail
is
short
more
resembling
that
of
a
dog
their
color
light
brown
their
bark
resembles
the
chirp
of
an
english
throstle
and
something
like
the
chirp
of
a
squirrel
they
appear
to
live
on
grass
as
it
is
all
eaten
off
close
to
the
ground
throughout
the
extent
of
their
dog
town
and
the
ground
looks
naked
and
barren
as
a
desert
several
of
the
brethren
shot
at
the
dogs
but
failed
in
killing
any
we
had
a
north
wind
this
afternoon
and
cold
weather
our
course
being
nearly
west
over
a
level
prairie
not
far
distant
from
the
island
since
noon
we
traveled
about
eight
miles
and
the
encampment
was
formed
at
half
past
six
near
a
small
lake
about
a
mile
above
the
head
of
grand
island
the
grass
is
not
so
good
here
as
it
has
been
back
and
but
a
poor
chance
for
the
cattle
to
fill
themselves
the
appearance
of
the
wild
buffalo
at
a
distance
is
somewhat
singular
the
color
of
the
back
and
about
half
way
down
the
sides
is
a
light
brown
the
rest
is
a
very
dark
brown
the
shoulder
appears
slightly
rounding
and
humped
when
running
the
large
shaggy
head
hangs
low
down
about
half
way
in
height
between
the
ground
and
the
top
of
the
shoulder
they
canter
like
any
ox
or
cow
but
appear
far
more
cumbersome
and
heavy
especially
about
the
fore
parts
which
look
larger
than
they
really
are
on
account
of
the
long
thick
matty
hair
they
run
tolerably
fast
but
a
good
horse
will
easily
gain
on
them
they
will
run
a
long
time
without
diminishing
their
speed
their
meat
is
very
sweet
and
tender
as
veal
sunday
may
this
morning
is
fine
but
cold
ice
about
half
an
inch
thick
sometime
in
the
night
a
buffalo
and
calf
came
within
a
short
distance
of
the
wagons
the
guard
discovered
them
and
shot
at
the
calf
wounding
it
in
the
hind
leg
they
caught
it
alive
and
tied
it
up
near
the
wagons
but
concluded
finally
to
kill
and
dress
it
about
six
we
were
gladdened
to
see
joseph
hancock
come
into
camp
with
a
piece
of
buffalo
meat
he
reported
that
he
killed
a
buffalo
yesterday
back
on
the
bluffs
and
there
being
no
one
with
him
he
concluded
to
stay
by
it
over
night
he
made
a
fire
and
scattered
a
little
powder
around
his
buffalo
to
keep
off
the
wolves
some
visited
him
during
the
night
but
were
awed
by
the
fire
after
he
had
told
his
story
and
taken
breakfast
brother
hancock
started
in
company
with
four
or
five
other
brethren
to
fetch
in
the
meat
on
horseback
as
no
wagons
could
get
over
the
bluffs
to
it
they
found
that
the
wolves
had
devoured
much
of
it
but
the
balance
they
brought
along
with
them
they
also
killed
two
antelope
and
brought
them
into
camp
the
total
number
of
buffalo
now
caught
is
five
large
ones
and
seven
calves
edmund
ellsworth
killed
one
of
the
prairie
dogs
and
brought
it
to
camp
it
looks
much
like
a
squirrel
only
the
body
is
thicker
and
the
tail
short
and
no
bush
on
it
the
day
grew
pleasant
till
about
noon
when
it
became
cloudy
and
cold
president
young
kimball
and
others
started
out
to
look
out
a
camp
ground
where
better
feed
can
be
obtained
for
our
stock
they
returned
a
little
after
two
and
gave
orders
to
go
on
a
few
miles
there
have
been
a
number
of
buffalo
seen
in
different
directions
one
grazing
within
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
camp
but
orders
were
not
to
hunt
or
shoot
today
at
the
camp
started
and
traveled
two
miles
over
dog
towns
as
yesterday
at
a
little
after
four
we
camped
beside
a
long
lake
of
shoal
clear
water
near
the
banks
of
the
platte
this
lake
is
about
three
rods
wide
and
connects
with
the
river
the
platte
appears
about
two
miles
wide
at
this
place
but
very
shoal
and
muddy
there
is
no
timber
but
plenty
of
grass
mostly
last
year
growth
the
weather
is
more
temperate
and
the
wind
ceased
president
young
kimball
and
others
went
on
to
look
out
a
crossing
place
over
this
lake
etc
on
their
way
they
fell
in
with
a
buffalo
cow
and
calf
and
chased
them
some
to
get
a
view
of
them
but
not
to
kill
on
their
return
they
said
we
should
tarry
here
tomorrow
and
have
some
blacksmith
work
done
and
probably
hunt
some
half
of
the
hide
off
the
bull
face
was
brought
into
camp
on
examination
i
found
the
mark
where
porter
shot
at
his
head
the
ball
made
a
small
hole
barely
cutting
through
the
outer
surface
or
grain
of
the
hide
which
was
near
an
inch
thick
the
hair
near
the
top
of
the
head
is
about
a
foot
long
monday
may
this
morning
cold
and
ice
in
the
water
pails
the
hunters
are
going
out
on
foot
tanner
and
davenport
are
fixing
their
forges
to
do
some
repairing
shoeing
etc
at
about
nine
the
hunters
twenty
in
number
started
out
with
two
wagons
which
had
been
unloaded
for
the
purpose
at
the
same
time
fifteen
of
the
brethren
on
horseback
started
west
to
examine
the
route
etc
at
the
party
who
went
to
look
out
the
route
returned
and
reported
that
brother
empey
had
discovered
a
large
war
party
of
indians
while
he
was
chasing
an
antelope
the
indians
are
in
a
hollow
about
twelve
miles
distance
and
about
three
hundred
in
number
some
on
their
horses
and
some
standing
beside
them
holding
the
bridle
the
company
also
saw
nearly
twenty
scattered
indians
about
four
miles
from
here
when
this
report
was
made
orders
were
given
to
dispatch
a
number
of
the
brethren
on
horses
well
armed
to
warn
the
hunters
and
tell
them
to
come
to
camp
in
about
half
an
hour
men
started
out
on
this
mission
before
they
reached
the
bluffs
which
are
about
four
miles
from
here
some
of
the
hunters
were
on
their
way
to
camp
having
seen
only
one
buffalo
during
the
day
in
a
little
time
all
the
hunters
were
notified
and
were
on
their
way
back
they
arrived
about
six
having
got
three
antelope
and
the
horsemen
who
went
after
them
got
two
calves
which
were
all
brought
in
and
the
day
passed
without
accident
some
of
the
brethren
saw
some
objects
at
a
distance
which
by
their
motions
they
were
satisfied
were
indians
the
day
has
been
fine
but
cool
and
cloudy
with
occasionally
a
few
drops
of
rain
a
number
of
wagon
tires
have
been
set
and
other
blacksmithing
washing
drying
meat
done
the
wind
near
south
the
cannon
was
unlimbered
at
night
and
prepared
for
action
in
case
it
should
be
needed
tuesday
may
the
morning
fine
but
cool
wind
about
southwest
two
horses
ran
east
as
much
as
six
or
eight
miles
and
were
pursued
by
the
brethren
and
brought
back
william
smoot
was
thrown
from
a
horse
and
his
senses
knocked
out
of
him
by
the
fall
he
soon
recovered
and
appears
to
have
sustained
no
injury
at
the
camp
was
called
and
received
instructions
from
president
young
especially
in
regard
to
leaving
the
wagons
and
scattering
off
hunting
without
counsel
he
strongly
urged
the
brethren
not
to
do
it
any
more
and
said
if
they
did
some
of
them
would
be
caught
by
the
indians
and
if
not
killed
would
be
severely
abused
the
instructions
and
regulations
given
april
were
read
and
enjoined
upon
the
camp
to
be
observed
more
strictly
it
was
decided
that
the
cannon
wagon
should
be
unloaded
the
box
put
on
another
wagon
so
that
the
cannon
can
be
always
ready
for
action
an
addition
of
ten
volunteers
was
made
to
the
standing
guard
and
ordered
that
all
horses
and
mules
should
be
tied
inside
the
circle
at
night
and
the
cattle
and
cows
outside
within
a
few
rods
of
the
wagons
a
guard
to
be
placed
around
the
cattle
when
turned
out
to
graze
it
is
thought
best
to
travel
with
the
wagons
four
abreast
and
the
cannon
to
go
in
the
rear
at
nine
the
wagons
commenced
moving
and
passed
over
the
lake
near
its
junction
with
the
river
at
which
place
it
is
about
ten
or
twelve
feet
wide
after
traveling
about
a
half
a
mile
the
camp
stopped
some
time
waiting
for
some
wagons
behind
while
stopping
three
wagons
were
discovered
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
considered
to
be
traders
going
back
to
council
bluffs
the
river
is
about
two
miles
wide
and
no
person
here
acquainted
with
it
consequently
no
one
attempted
to
go
over
which
many
desired
about
eleven
we
proceeded
five
wagons
abreast
so
as
to
be
better
prepared
for
defense
should
the
indians
attack
us
after
traveling
about
two
miles
one
of
the
men
from
the
wagons
on
the
other
side
the
river
overtook
us
and
we
halted
to
see
him
he
said
there
are
only
nine
of
them
they
have
been
to
fort
laramie
for
furs
and
are
going
to
council
bluffs
this
is
the
sixteenth
day
since
they
left
the
fort
with
ox
teams
he
says
the
road
is
good
on
the
other
side
and
the
river
easily
forded
being
not
more
than
knee
deep
in
the
deepest
place
and
a
good
bottom
he
cheerfully
agreed
to
carry
letters
back
for
us
but
could
not
wait
long
i
wrote
one
to
my
family
and
in
about
half
an
hour
a
pretty
large
mail
was
made
up
to
send
back
to
winter
quarters
and
may
the
lord
grant
that
it
may
arrive
safely
brother
johnson
bought
a
buffalo
robe
of
the
man
for
about
a
pound
and
a
half
of
coffee
and
another
brother
bought
one
for
a
pound
of
sugar
and
a
little
pork
i
feel
my
mind
relieved
by
this
unexpected
privilege
of
writing
back
to
my
dear
family
and
hope
they
will
have
the
pleasure
of
perusing
the
contents
at
twenty
minutes
after
one
the
bugle
sounded
for
a
march
and
the
messenger
is
returning
with
the
letters
and
a
bag
of
provisions
on
his
shoulder
which
the
brethren
have
given
him
for
carrying
the
letters
we
traveled
about
four
miles
farther
and
at
stopped
to
let
the
teams
feed
on
a
small
spot
where
the
fire
has
not
touched
the
rest
having
all
been
burned
off
within
a
few
days
we
have
traveled
today
only
about
six
miles
having
stopped
much
the
country
is
still
very
level
and
nice
traveling
only
for
the
dust
the
wind
south
and
our
course
nearly
west
when
the
trader
went
back
over
the
river
thomas
woolsey
john
brown
and
john
pack
accompanied
him
on
horses
to
speak
with
a
person
whom
brother
woolsey
is
acquainted
with
they
returned
soon
after
we
stopped
to
feed
and
say
that
the
river
is
very
good
to
cross
not
being
more
than
two
feet
deep
in
the
deepest
place
and
the
bottom
good
the
horses
broke
through
but
very
little
the
traders
say
furthermore
that
if
we
continue
on
this
side
we
shall
have
to
cross
the
river
twice
where
the
water
is
much
deeper
and
can
not
be
crossed
only
in
a
ferry
there
is
a
good
traveled
road
also
which
would
be
an
advantage
we
have
not
got
on
this
side
during
the
time
we
stopped
to
feed
a
guard
was
placed
around
the
cattle
and
horses
to
keep
them
from
straying
far
from
the
wagons
then
men
were
called
out
and
drilled
with
their
loaded
guns
in
the
circle
formed
by
the
wagons
some
objects
are
seen
grazing
about
four
miles
west
of
us
thought
to
be
buffalo
thirteen
in
number
some
of
the
hunters
are
going
out
to
give
them
a
chase
and
try
to
kill
some
of
them
at
a
quarter
after
five
the
camp
was
called
together
and
brother
brown
reported
what
the
traders
said
about
the
route
as
above
the
subject
was
then
talked
over
and
when
it
was
considered
that
we
are
making
a
road
for
thousands
of
saints
to
follow
and
they
can
not
ford
the
river
when
the
snow
melts
from
the
mountains
it
was
unanimously
voted
to
keep
on
this
side
as
far
as
fort
laramie
at
least
soon
after
this
we
started
on
again
saw
a
lone
buffalo
but
a
short
distance
from
us
but
it
galloped
across
the
river
saw
also
a
number
of
antelope
and
some
deer
about
seven
we
passed
a
spot
where
the
indians
have
camped
and
must
have
been
many
of
them
a
while
after
sundown
we
arrived
at
a
creek
of
good
water
and
camped
for
the
night
having
traveled
about
nine
miles
today
the
prairie
level
but
all
the
grass
burned
off
except
in
small
patches
we
have
camped
on
a
small
spot
which
has
escaped
the
fire
elder
kimball
who
was
one
of
the
hunters
who
started
out
at
four
said
the
objects
seen
from
camp
were
antelope
but
he
had
seen
a
herd
of
buffalo
about
a
mile
ahead
of
where
we
now
are
he
named
this
creek
buffalo

fine
and
very
pleasant

two
small
herds
of
buffalo
a
few
miles
from
camp
at
continued
our
journey
i
went
on

about
two
miles
and
then
stopped
to
count
the
horses

oxen
and
afterwards
walked
on
again
to
the
first
wagons
here
elder
kimball
offered
me
his
horse
to
ride
i
then
went
ahead
with
the
horsemen
we
soon
after
came
to
a
very
bad
slough
and
had
to
bear
off
to
the
north
to
find
a
place
to
cross
it
the
prairie
after
we
crossed
this
slough
about
a
mile
wide
from
the
river
was
very
soft
and
it
was
necessary
to
bear
still
farther
to
the
north
the
horses
feet
cut
through
the
sod
and
the
ground
appeared
wet
under
although
there
has
been
no
rain
for
some
time
at
we
stopped
to
feed
on
a
small
patch
of
unburnt
grass
having
come
about
nine
miles
course
about
west
with
a
very
strong
south
wind
there
were
two
buffalo
within
about
a
half
a
mile
from
camp
grazing
some
of
the
brethren
went
to
view
them
but
the
orders
of
the
day
are
not
to
kill
anything
which
the
men
can
not
carry
to
camp
there
are
no
appearances
of
indians
near
except
the
prairie
which
is
still
burning
ahead
of
us
supposed
to
be
set
on
fire
by
them
about
one
continued
our
journey

it
without
shooting
at
it
and
led
it
to
camp
the
revenue
cutter
was
unloaded
and
sent
after
the
cow
and
calf
left
they
being
about
three
miles
off
we
traveled
on
about
a
half
an
hour
and
found
the
prairie
all
in
a
blaze
president
young
and
kimball
thinking
it
unsafe
to
risk
the
wagons
near
the
fire
ordered
the
camp
to
go
back
a
half
a
mile
to
an
island
where
we
can
have
water
for
our
teams
and
be
secure
from
the
fire
the
prairie
is
all
burned
bare
and
the
black
ashes
fly
bad
making
the
brethren
look
more
like
indians
than
white
folks
there
is
some
feed
on
the
island
and
the
cattle
easily
ford
the
stream
to
it
the
calf
is
tied
in
the
circle
when
a
dog
goes
near
it
it
will
attack
the
largest
and
they
flee
from
it
though
not
more
than
six
or
eight
weeks
old
about
half
past
six
the
revenue
cutter
arrived
with
the
meat
which
was
fatter
than
any
we
have
had
they
also
brought
in
another
calf
which
they
killed
while
out
for
the
cow
making
a
total
of
one
cow
and
six
calves
brought
into
camp
today
the
meat
was
divided
amongst
the
companies
of
ten
each
having
either
a
calf
or
half
a
quarter
of
a
cow
thursday
may
this
morning
at
president
young
called
to
the
camp
and
proposed
to
go
on
to
where
we
can
find
feed
for
the
teams
the
brethren
assented
and
he
gave
orders
to
start
as
quickly
as
possible
however
some
must
feed
their
teams
a
little
corn
some
milk
their
cows
and
it
took
till
near
to
get
started
during
the
night
the
lord
sent
a
light
shower
of
rain
which
has
put
the
fire
out
except
in
one
or
two
places
and
made
it
perfectly
safe
traveling
we
have
had
a
strong
southeast
wind
through
the
night
but
the
morning
is
calm
and
pleasant
we
traveled
about
two
miles
and
stopped
on
the
unburned
grass
to
feed
at
a
quarter
to
seven
several
antelope
were
surrounded
by
the
brethren
and
some
shot
at
them
killing
one
the
rest
made
their
escape
we
can
see
several
large
herds
of
buffalo
within
about
two
miles
of
the
camp
and
many
calves
amongst
them
president
young
and
kimball
rode
ahead
to
find
a
place
to
stop
for
feed
the
ground
is
hard
and
good
traveling
at
a
quarter
to
nine
proceeded
on
president
young
and
kimball
going
ahead
to
point
out
the
road
our
course
about
northwest
the
wind
strong
from
west
we
traveled
near
the
river
saw
thirteen
elk
together
also
many
antelope
and
numerous
herds
of
buffalo
on
both
sides
of
the
river
jackson
redding
shot
an
antelope
which
luke
johnson
chased
near
the
wagons
a
young
buffalo
calf
followed
luke
to
camp
but
the
president
advised
him
to
leave
it
as
it
is
only
a
few
days
old
we
stopped
near
the
river
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
having
traveled
about
six
miles
we
find
a
little
more
grass
here
but
the
numerous
herds
of
buffalo
keep
it
eaten
off
close
to
the
ground
nearly
all
the
way
we
have
traveled
today
the
president
gave
orders
that
no
more
game
should
be
killed
until
further
orders
it
appears
we
have
got
as
much
meat
in
camp
as
can
be
taken
care
of
while
we
were
stopping
for
noon
some
of
the
cows
moved
off
towards
a
large
buffalo
herd
and
when
president
young
and
kimball
started
ahead
after
dinner
they
discovered
the
cows
near
the
buffalo
brother
woolsey
went
to
turn
them
back
but
he
had
to
run
his
mule
some
distance
before
he
could
prevent
the
cows
from
mingling
with
the
buffalo
they
brought
the
cows
back
to
the
wagons
and
then
proceeded
ahead
again
one
part
of
the
horsemen
business
today
has
been
to
drive
the
buffalo
out
of
our
track
judging
it
unsafe
to
risk
them
between
the
wagons
and
the
river
the
camp
proceeded
on
at
and
in
about
two
miles
distance
found
a
lake
of
clear
water
here
we
discovered
the
horsemen
coming
back
and
found
that
the
president
had
lost
his
large
spy
glass
while
chasing
the
cows
from
the
buffalo
herd
a
second
time
he
did
not
find
it
we
traveled
slowly
this
afternoon
some
of
the
horses
and
oxen
having
given
out
in
consequence
of
lack
of
feed
to
sustain
them
we
traveled
till
and
camped
near
some
islands
in
the
river
having
traveled
about
seven
miles
this
afternoon
and
fifteen
through
the
day
our
course
a
little
west
of
northwest
wind
about
west
some
think
we
have
traveled
eighteen
some
twenty
and
some
even
miles
today
but
from
the
number
of
times
we
stopped
and
the
slowness
with
which
the
teams
moved
i
feel
satisfied
that
fifteen
miles
is
plenty
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
back
we
saw
a
buffalo
cow
which
appears
to
be
sick
she
fought
the
dogs
some
time
and
then
lay
down
and
the
brethren
went
close
to
her
some
venturing
to
feel
and
handle
her
i
was
within
six
or
eight
feet
of
her
and
had
a
good
view
as
much
as
i
wanted
she
has
lost
all
her
hair
and
looks
very
poor
and
weak
the
president
ordered
that
the
brethren
leave
her
and
not
disturb
her
and
she
was
left
lying
down
but
it
is
doubtful
the
wolves
will
kill
and
eat
her
before
morning
when
the
brethren
went
back
to
hunt
the
spy
glass
they
found
that
the
wolves
had
killed
the
calf
and
nearly
eaten
it
up
what
they
had
not
eaten
they
carried
off
with
them
we
have
never
been
out
of
sight
of
herds
of
buffalo
today
and
from
where
we
are
camped
i
am
satisfied
we
can
see
over
five
thousand
with
the
glass
the
largest
herd
we
have
yet
seen
is
still
ahead
of
us
the
prairie
looks
black
with
them
both
on
this
and
the
other
side
of
the
river
some
think
we
have
passed
fifty
and
some
even
a
hundred
thousand
during
the
day
or
have
seen
them
it
is
truly
a
sight
wonderful
to
behold
and
can
scarcely
be
credited
by
those
who
have
not
actually
seen
them
friday
may
this
morning
the
wind
northwest
and
almost
as
cold
as
winter
the
buffalo
vastly
numerous
all
around
about
eight
the
camp
was
called
together
and
measures
taken
to
raise
more
teams
to
put
to
the
canyon
as
some
of
the
horses
and
even
cattle
have
given
out
the
president
chastised
elder
snow
for
not
attending
to
the
cows
yesterday
causing
the
president
to
lose
his
spy
glass
it
being
brother
turn
to
drive
the
cows
according
to
his
own
voluntary
agreement
at
a
little
before
eleven
porter
rockwell
thomas
brown
and
joseph
mathews
started
back
to
hunt
the
spy
glass
and
soon
after
they
left
the
camp
proceeded
onward
the
day
was
cloudy
and
very
cold
our
course
about
northwest
we
traveled
about
seven
miles
and
camped
at
near
several
small
islands
on
the
banks
of
the
river
about
four
porter
and
the
others
returned
having
found
the
spy
glass
which
was
a
source
of
joy
to
all
the
brethren
at
the
companies
were
called
out
to
drill
i
have
been
very
sick
all
day
with
a
complaint
and
have
suffered
much
saturday
may
morning
cold
but
fine
started
out
at
nine
and
traveled
till
one
distance
seven
and
a
half
miles
course
a
little
west
of
northwest
the
prairie
on
both
sides
of
the
river
is
literally
black
with
buffalo
and
to
try
to
say
as
to
what
number
we
have
seen
this
morning
would
be
folly
i
should
imagine
that
at
a
moderate
calculation
we
have
seen
over
fifty
thousand
they
are
more
tame
than
they
have
been
and
will
stand
till
the
wagons
come
within
two
hundred
yards
of
them
porter
has
shot
one
about
two
years
old
the
meat
looks
nice
there
is
no
difficulty
in
getting
meat
enough
it
is
with
some
difficulty
that
the
horsemen
can
drive
them
away
from
the
track
as
fast
as
the
wagons
come
up
it
is
very
warm
today
and
no
wind
i
have
counted
the
revolutions
of
a
wagon
wheel
to
tell
the
exact
distance
we
have
traveled
the
reason
why
i
have
taken
this
method
which
is
somewhat
tedious
is
because
there
is
generally
a
difference
of
two
and
sometimes
four
miles
in
a
day
travel
between
my
estimation
and
that
of
some
others
and
they
have
all
thought
i
underrated
it
this
morning
i
determined
to
take
pains
to
know
for
a
certainty
how
far
we
travel
today
accordingly
i
measured
the
circumference
of
the
nigh
hind
wheel
of
one
of
brother
kimball
wagons
being
the
one
i
sleep
in
in
charge
of
philo
johnson
i
found
the
wheel
feet
inches
in
circumference
not
varying
one
eighth
of
an
inch
i
then
calculated
how
many
revolutions
it
would
require
for
one
mile
and
found
it
precisely
not
varying
one
fraction
which
somewhat
astonished
me
i
have
counted
the
whole
revolutions
during
the
day
travel
and
i
find
it
to
be
a
little
over
eleven
and
a
quarter
miles
twenty
revolutions
over
the
overplus
i
shall
add
to
the
next
day
travel
according
to
my
previous
calculations
we
were
two
hundred
miles
from
winter
quarters
this
morning
before
we
started
after
traveling
ten
miles
i
placed
a
small
cedar
post
in
the
ground
with
these
words
written
on
it
with
a
pencil
from
winter
quarters
two
hundred
miles
may
camp
all
well
wm
clayton
some
have
past
the
day
travel
at
thirteen
and
some
fourteen
miles
which
serves
to
convince
more
strongly
that
the
distances
are
overrated
i
have
repeatedly
suggested
a
plan
of
fixing
machinery
to
a
wagon
wheel
to
tell
the
exact
distance
we
travel
in
a
day
and
many
begin
to
be
sanguine
for
carrying
it
into
effect
and
i
hope
it
will
be
done
our
course
this
afternoon
has
been
northwest
no
wind
and
the
prairie
as
bare
as
a
poor
english
pasture
the
grass
being
eaten
off
by
uncountable
herds
of
buffalo
no
pen
nor
tongue
can
give
an
idea
of
the
multitude
now
in
sight
continually
and
it
appears
difficult
to
keep
them
away
from
the
wagons
two
calves
have
been
killed
and
brought
to
camp
and
multitudes
would
be
killed
if
the
president
did
not
prohibit
the
brethren
from
killing
them
only
as
we
need
the
meat
truly
the
lord
cattle
upon
the
thousand
hills
are
numerous
we
are
now
camped
on
the
banks
of
the
river
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
where
the
range
of
bluffs
which
have
appeared
exceedingly
ragged
all
day
strike
the
river
and
when
we
move
again
we
have
got
to
cross
over
them
president
young
and
kimball
have
been
back
on
the
bluffs
on
foot
some
distance
and
report
that
as
far
as
they
can
see
the
grass
is
eaten
perfectly
bare
and
the
prospect
for
feed
for
our
teams
is
poor
indeed
there
are
several
buffalo
lying
dead
around
here
whether
dead
from
old
age
or
by
the
hands
of
hunters
or
of
starvation
it
is
unknown
many
of
the
brethren
have
to
cook
their
victuals
on
dry
buffalo
dung
there
being
no
wood
near
sunday
may
the
morning
very
cold
with
wind
southeast
at
we
proceeded
on
three
and
a
half
miles
going
a
little
around
some
of
the
bluffs
until
we
turned
down
on
a
low
bottom
and
very
sandy
we
have
camped
near
some
islands
and
can
get
wood
and
water
but
poor
feed
for
the
teams
we
arrived
here
at
and
shall
stay
till
morning
soon
as
the
camp
was
formed
i
went
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
below
to
the
river
and
washed
my
socks
towel
and
handkerchief
as
well
as
i
could
in
cold
water
without
soap
i
then
stripped
my
clothing
off
and
washed
from
head
to
foot
which
has
made
me
feel
much
more
comfortable
for
i
was
covered
with
dust
after
washing
and
putting
on
clean
clothing
i
sat
down
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
gave
way
to
a
long
train
of
solemn
reflections
respecting
many
things
especially
in
regard
to
my
family
and
their
welfare
for
time
and
eternity
i
shall
not
write
my
thoughts
here
inasmuch
as
i
expect
this
journal
will
have
to
pass
through
other
hands
besides
my
own
or
that
of
my
family
but
if
i
can
carry
my
plans
into
operation
they
will
be
written
in
a
manner
that
my
family
will
each
get
their
portion
whether
before
my
death
or
after
it
matters
not
the
day
is
very
warm
and
the
wind
has
moved
to
the
west
according
to
my
calculations
we
are
now
miles
from
winter
quarters
lacking
a
few
rods
i
got
a
small
board
and
wrote
on
it
from
winter
quarters
three
hundred
miles
may
pioneer
camp
all
well
distance
according
to
the
reckoning
of
wm
clayton
this
was
nailed
on
a
post
and
in
the
evening
i
went
and
set
it
up
about
three
hundred
yards
from
here
on
a
bend
of
the
river
spent
the
afternoon
reading
and
writing
in
elder
kimball
journal
at
three
a
meeting
was
called
and
the
camp
addressed
by
several
president
young
took
tea
with
elder
kimball
and
afterwards
they
started
out
together
with
one
or
two
others
to
look
at
the
country
ahead
of
us
they
went
a
few
miles
and
found
a
small
stream
which
we
shall
have
to
cross
here
they
saw
multitudes
of
buffalo
coming
to
water
porter
and
phineas
young
went
within
six
or
eight
rods
of
them
to
try
to
get
one
but
in
the
whole
herd
they
could
not
find
one
fit
to
kill
they
are
very
poor
for
there
is
no
feed
for
them
and
in
fact
they
are
so
numerous
that
they
eat
the
grass
as
fast
as
it
springs
there
are
however
some
good
cottonwood
groves
and
good
water
at
the
stream
after
sundown
the
wind
blew
strong
from
the
northwest
and
the
evening
was
cold
and
chilly
monday
may
the
morning
fine
but
cool
the
wind
nearly
ceased
last
night
i
dreamed
that
i
was
in
company
with
the
camp
which
was
stopping
beside
a
considerable
river
of
deep
water
our
horses
and
cattle
were
tied
to
stakes
all
around
the
camp
to
the
distance
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
some
good
timber
thinly
scattered
around
i
thought
president
young
kimball
and
several
others
started
up
the
river
in
a
flat
boat
without
stating
their
object
leaving
the
brethren
to
guard
the
camp
cattle
etc
in
their
absence
when
they
had
been
gone
sometime
i
thought
a
large
herd
of
buffalo
came
on
full
gallop
right
amongst
our
horses
and
cattle
causing
them
to
break
their
ropes
and
fly
in
every
direction
the
brethren
seemed
thunderstruck
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
seeing
a
small
skiff
in
the
river
i
sprang
into
it
and
a
paddle
lying
in
it
i
commenced
rowing
in
pursuit
of
the
president
it
seemed
as
though
i
literally
flew
through
the
water
passing
everything
on
the
way
like
a
railway
carriage
in
a
few
minutes
i
overtook
the
brethren
in
the
flat
boat
took
the
skiff
and
threw
it
on
shore
and
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
that
the
skiff
was
made
only
of
barks
and
cracked
all
over
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
put
it
in
the
water
without
sinking
it
the
paddle
with
which
i
had
rowed
proved
to
be
a
very
large
feather
and
i
had
another
feather
in
my
left
hand
with
which
i
steered
the
skiff
when
i
got
into
the
flat
boat
i
made
known
what
had
passed
in
the
camp
but
the
brethren
seemed
no
ways
alarmed
i
awoke
and
behold
it
was
all
a
dream
richards
is
going
to
deposit
a
letter
in
a
stick
of
wood
prepared
for
the
purpose
near
this
place
in
such
a
manner
that
the
next
company
will
discover
it
he
fixed
it
on
a
long
pole
and
being
assisted
by
president
young
and
others
raised
it
and
fixed
it
firm
in
the
ground
his
distance
from
winter
quarters
three
hundred
and
sixteen
miles
at
nine
five
the
camp
proceeded
onward
after
traveling
two
miles
we
crossed
a
small
creek
which
elder
kimball
named
skunk
creek
easily
forded
though
the
ground
was
soft
on
the
west
side
about
this
time
the
brethren
at
the
head
of
the
camp
discovered
a
strange
horse
alone
on
the
prairie
porter
and
thomas
brown
gave
chase
to
try
to
catch
it
brother
john
brown
states
that
when
the
mississippi
company
passed
on
the
other
side
last
season
one
of
the
brethren
lost
a
mare
and
two
colts
and
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
oldest
of
the
two
when
brother
woolsey
and
tippets
came
through
from
the
battalion
last
winter
they
saw
the
same
horse
near
here
we
traveled
till
twelve
five
and
finding
a
little
better
feed
stopped
for
dinner
having
traveled
a
few
rods
over
six
miles
the
last
two
miles
was
over
very
soft
prairie
and
although
the
last
year
grass
has
not
been
burned
the
wheels
cut
through
the
sod
frequently
at
the
creek
four
miles
back
some
of
the
brethren
shot
a
buffalo
which
was
brought
into
camp
in
the
revenue
cutter
the
meat
is
said
to
be
good
and
the
fattest
we
have
had
at
two
we
continued
our
journey
about
the
same
time
porter
and
brown
returned
having
failed
to
catch
the
horse
after
traveling
about
half
a
mile
we
crossed
a
very
bad
slough
and
beyond
that
for
a
mile
the
ground
was
wet
and
soft
the
teams
began
to
give
out
and
at
half
past
four
the
president
ordered
the
wagons
to
strike
for
the
timber
which
was
a
little
out
of
our
course
but
necessary
to
favor
the
teams
and
obtain
wood
and
water
we
arrived
near
the
timber
and
camped
at
four
fifty
having
traveled
since
my
last
guide
post
a
little
over
nine
and
miles
the
last
two
miles
the
ground
being
dry
and
good
traveling
some
of
the
hunters
killed
a
deer
and
we
had
some
venison
for
supper
our
course
a
little
north
of
west
light
wind
from
northwest
the
day
warm
and
pleasant
we
have
a
little
better
feed
for
cattle
and
on
the
island
plenty
of
brouse
for
horses
better
timber
than
we
have
had
for
some
time
past
it
appears
plain
that
vast
herds
of
buffalo
have
wintered
here
but
have
mostly
left
and
gone
eastward
sometime
ago
and
we
have
the
full
growth
of
this
year
grass
which
is
small
indeed
the
grass
evidently
springs
later
the
farther
west
we
travel
and
nature
seems
to
have
taught
the
wild
cattle
this
lesson
hence
their
eastward
progress
there
are
some
scattering
herds
of
buffalo
around
but
not
nearly
so
numerous
as
they
were
some
thirty
miles
back
the
face
of
the
country
here
is
indeed
beautiful
the
soil
rich
on
the
bottoms
the
ragged
bluffs
on
each
side
of
the
river
have
a
splendid
appearance
and
at
about
ten
miles
distance
west
of
where
we
now
are
they
seem
to
circle
around
until
they
form
a
junction
it
appears
evident
also
that
we
are
above
the
junction
of
the
north
and
south
forks
of
the
platte
the
north
fork
running
nearly
northwest
and
the
south
fork
southwest
brother
woolsey
says
these
are
the
forks
in
reality
but
are
connected
some
miles
higher
up
by
a
slough
and
consequently
the
land
between
is
set
down
by
travelers
as
the
main
land
rather
than
as
an
island
tuesday
may
the
morning
cold
wind
east
camp
well
at
went
with
a
number
of
the
brethren
who
were
going
to
dig
some
wolves
out
of
a
hole
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
camp
they
dug
out
four
and
brought
them
alive
to
camp
they
are
probably
six
or
eight
weeks
old
and
about
the
size
of
an
english
hare
very
vicious
at
half
past
nine
the
camp
moved
onward
over
a
very
nice
level
dry
prairie
for
five
miles
amongst
the
timber
on
the
island
could
be
seen
many
small
cedar
trees
at
the
end
of
five
miles
we
had
to
pass
over
a
small
ridge
of
low
sandy
bluffs
which
extended
to
the
river
after
passing
nearly
over
the
bluffs
we
stopped
half
an
hour
to
water
the
teams
and
eat
a
little
dinner
then
proceeded
on
three
miles
farther
and
passed
over
a
creek
of
clear
water
but
this
could
not
be
very
good
in
consequence
of
so
many
dead
buffalo
lying
in
it
we
proceeded
on
half
a
mile
and
finding
tolerably
good
feed
stopped
for
the
night
having
traveled
eight
and
half
miles
today
weather
fine
wind
south
and
southeast
course
a
little
west
or
northwest
we
have
seen
few
buffalo
today
but
there
are
signs
of
thousands
having
wintered
in
the
neighborhood
the
country
looks
beautiful
soil
rich
only
lacking
timber
after
the
camp
was
formed
it
being
half
a
mile
to
water
the
brethren
dug
two
wells
and
about
four
feet
deep
found
plenty
of
good
water
one
of
the
wells
is
reported
to
run
a
pail
full
a
minute
brother
appleton
harmon
is
working
at
the
machinery
for
the
wagon
to
tell
the
distance
we
travel
and
expects
to
have
it
in
operation
tomorrow
which
will
save
me
the
trouble
of
counting
as
i
have
done
during
the
last
four
days
took
supper
on
some
duck
presented
to
elder
kimball
by
george
billings
wednesday
may
morning
cool
weather
fine
brother
appleton
harmon
has
completed
the
machinery
on
the
wagon
so
far
that
i
shall
only
have
to
count
the
number
of
miles
instead
of
the
revolution
of
the
wagon
wheel
we
started
at
the
first
mile
pretty
soft
the
rest
tolerably
hard
and
very
good
traveling
we
have
passed
over
vast
beds
of
salt
or
rather
dust
with
a
salt
taste
it
looks
something
like
dirty
flour
traveled
eight
miles
in
four
hours
and
two
minutes
and
stopped
at
to
feed
nearly
opposite
two
small
islands
the
feed
tolerably
good
our
course
northwest
considerable
strong
wind
from
southeast
covering
everything
in
the
wagons
with
dust
and
sand
no
timber
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
but
little
on
the
islands
the
hunters
report
that
they
have
seen
many
dead
buffalo
between
here
and
the
bluff
with
the
hides
off
and
tongues
taken
out
a
strong
proof
that
indians
have
been
here
very
recently
as
the
flesh
looks
fresh
and
lately
killed
the
range
of
bluffs
on
each
side
the
river
extend
much
farther
apart
and
near
the
foot
of
the
south
range
can
be
seen
timber
scattering
along
which
is
an
evidence
that
the
south
fork
ranges
in
that
direction
although
some
are
sanguine
that
we
have
not
yet
arrived
at
the
junction
at
half
past
three
we
moved
on
again
and
traveled
four
miles
camped
at
a
quarter
to
six
near
a
bunch
of
small
islands
and
a
kind
of
bayou
projecting
from
the
river
our
course
this
afternoon
a
little
south
of
west
having
come
around
a
considerable
bend
in
the
river
the
land
good
and
good
traveling
wind
southeast
several
of
the
brethren
caught
a
number
of
small
fish
in
the
bayou
or
lake
the
feed
here
is
rather
scanty
heavy
clouds
are
rising
in
the
west
and
northwest
and
a
fair
prospect
for
some
rain
which
is
much
needed
it
is
now
certain
that
we
are
about
fourteen
and
a
half
miles
above
the
junction
of
the
north
and
south
forks
of
the
platte
and
although
we
have
to
make
a
new
road
all
the
way
we
find
no
obstacles
so
far
brother
woodruff
reports
that
he
has
been
beyond
the
bluffs
north
of
the
camp
and
saw
upwards
of
wickeups
where
the
indians
have
camped
very
recently
he
found
a
cured
buffalo
skin
and
some
pieces
of
other
skins
also
the
hunters
killed
a
two
year
old
buffalo
and
brought
it
to
camp
brother
orson
pratt
reports
that
when
we
were
five
and
a
half
miles
back
we
were
in
latitude
thursday
may
this
morning
cold
and
cloudy
cold
enough
for
overcoats
and
buffalo
robes
the
buffalo
which
was
killed
yesterday
was
cut
up
and
divided
this
morning
amongst
the
companies
of
tens
some
feelings
are
manifest
this
morning
between
brothers
thomas
tanner
and
aaron
farr
on
account
of
the
former
taking
the
latter
prisoner
and
putting
him
under
a
guard
part
of
the
night
perhaps
aaron
was
a
little
out
of
order
in
conversing
loud
after
the
horn
blew
for
prayers
but
i
think
brother
tanner
angry
spirit
more
blameable
at
we
moved
onward
nearly
a
west
course
four
miles
and
at
stopped
to
feed
teams
at
a
spot
which
is
a
little
better
than
we
generally
have
the
wind
strong
from
north
and
northeast
at
half
past
twelve
we
proceeded
on
again
and
traveled
till
four
distance
six
and
three
quarters
miles
at
this
distance
we
arrived
at
a
stream
about
six
rods
wide
which
appears
to
come
from
the
northeast
the
water
in
appearance
like
the
platte
the
bottom
of
the
river
quick
sand
water
in
the
middle
about
two
feet
deep
at
the
sides
quite
shoal
it
appears
that
travelers
have
never
discovered
this
stream
for
it
is
not
noticed
in
any
works
that
we
have
seen
we
crossed
it
without
difficulty
and
camped
on
its
banks
the
weather
cloudy
and
very
cold
with
a
strong
north
wind
presidents
young
and
kimball
rode
ahead
as
usual
to
look
out
the
road
they
report
that
the
bluffs
half
a
mile
west
come
clear
to
the
river
and
are
considerably
high
they
found
several
ranges
of
them
and
finally
found
a
valley
running
between
some
of
the
ranges
through
which
we
can
pass
by
going
about
a
mile
around
from
our
course
this
stream
according
to
measurement
and
one
quarter
miles
above
the
junction
of
the
two
forks
and
miles
from
winter
quarters
by
estimation
president
young
named
it
the
north
bluff
fork
a
while
before
we
arrived
here
four
of
the
brethren
went
to
chase
a
few
buffalo
which
were
lying
down
at
the
foot
of
the
bluffs
but
they
did
not
get
any
presidents
young
and
kimball
saw
a
very
large
rattlesnake
near
the
river
brother
kimball
says
the
largest
he
ever
saw
in
his
life
i
saw
a
small
green
snake
today
very
pretty
the
back
light
green
and
the
belly
a
pale
yellow
presidents
young
and
kimball
suffered
severely
with
cold
while
riding
over
the
bluffs
to
look
for
a
road
had
to
use
buffalo
dung
for
cooking
there
being
no
timber
friday
may
the
morning
cloudy
and
very
cold
in
the
west
could
occasionally
be
seen
streaks
of
lightning
and
distant
thunder
heard
at
the
dark
clouds
having
approached
nearer
it
commenced
raining
pretty
hard
accompanied
by
lightning
and
thunder
the
president
ordered
the
horses
got
up
just
before
the
rain
commenced
and
after
the
storm
ceased
we
started
onward
at
a
quarter
past
ten
after
traveling
about
a
mile
we
passed
among
and
around
the
high
bluffs
our
course
lying
nearly
in
a
north
direction
for
some
time
then
turning
south
and
on
again
approaching
the
river
nearly
southeast
when
within
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
river
we
stopped
to
feed
at
twenty
minutes
to
two
having
traveled
six
and
a
quarter
miles
we
have
got
on
the
level
bottom
again
and
are
probably
not
more
than
three
miles
in
a
direct
line
from
where
we
started
this
morning
presidents
young
and
kimball
went
forward
to
point
out
the
route
which
is
very
good
to
travel
although
considerably
uneven
brother
higbee
killed
an
antelope
and
wounded
another
which
made
its
escape
while
he
was
loading
his
rifle
we
have
better
feed
here
than
we
have
had
for
some
time
we
had
a
little
more
rain
just
as
we
came
to
a
halt
we
have
not
had
much
wind
this
morning
but
it
is
now
increasing
from
the
north
it
is
somewhat
warmer
than
this
morning
the
atmosphere
cloudy
and
looks
as
if
we
might
have
more
rain
the
land
between
the
two
forks
for
about
miles
is
perfectly
flat
and
very
level
without
timber
the
bluffs
there
rise
suddenly
apparently
in
a
line
from
fork
to
fork
there
are
many
buffalo
back
in
the
valleys
between
the
bluffs
and
although
there
is
no
sign
of
the
prairie
having
been
burned
it
is
evident
the
buffalo
have
kept
it
eaten
clean
off
but
have
moved
back
and
east
probably
since
the
indians
have
been
hunting
them
some
of
the
brethren
have
discovered
fresh
tracks
where
the
indians
have
gone
up
this
north
stream
evidently
very
lately
but
we
are
satisfied
the
lord
hears
the
prayers
of
his
servants
and
sends
them
out
of
the
way
before
we
come
up
to
them
at
three
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
keeping
above
the
lower
prairie
which
appeared
soft
and
swampy
our
road
was
very
uneven
we
went
two
and
a
half
miles
and
at
half
past
four
stopped
to
learn
the
report
of
those
gone
ahead
to
look
out
the
road
there
is
another
high
range
of
bluffs
about
half
a
mile
west
of
us
extending
to
the
river
elder
kimball
went
across
the
several
ranges
of
bluffs
to
the
west
side
and
hunted
for
a
road
in
various
directions
but
there
did
not
appear
to
be
any
possibility
of
finding
a
road
between
the
bluffs
without
going
many
miles
around
president
young
and
he
concluded
it
would
be
best
to
camp
where
the
wagons
are
and
in
the
morning
cross
right
over
the
bluffs
by
doubling
teams
accordingly
the
encampment
was
formed
about
the
train
having
traveled
eight
and
three
quarters
miles
today
our
course
this
afternoon
nearly
west
wind
southeast
the
feed
for
our
teams
grows
much
better
and
on
one
of
these
high
sandy
bluffs
i
saw
a
large
bed
of
flowers
not
unlike
the
violet
and
very
rich
the
sand
on
the
bluffs
in
some
places
looks
like
large
drifts
of
snow
and
in
other
places
seems
to
have
deep
chasms
as
if
wasted
by
heavy
rains
the
atmosphere
is
still
cloudy
but
not
so
cold
as
it
has
been
the
hunters
have
killed
two
buffalo
three
antelope
and
one
badger
during
the
day
which
will
be
very
acceptable
it
was
dark
when
the
hunters
returned
to
give
the
information
the
revenue
cutter
was
sent
after
the
meat
which
was
reported
to
be
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
it
was
late
when
they
returned
there
was
an
alarm
made
by
the
guard
in
the
night
supposing
the
indians
were
near
the
camp
were
aroused
to
secure
their
horses
but
we
had
no
further
trouble
about
them
i
discovered
that
brother
appleton
harmon
is
trying
to
have
it
understood
that
he
invented
the
machinery
to
tell
the
distance
we
travel
which
makes
me
think
less
of
him
than
i
formerly
did
he
is
not
the
inventor
of
it
by
a
long
way
but
he
has
made
the
machinery
after
being
told
how
to
do
it
what
little
souls
work
saturday
may
this
morning
is
very
cloudy
and
very
cold
more
like
a
january
morning
than
a
may
morning
the
wind
blows
strong
from
the
northeast
the
brethren
who
killed
the
buffalo
did
not
bring
it
to
camp
last
night
but
put
it
in
the
boat
and
left
it
till
morning
about
half
past
seven
they
brought
it
in
and
divided
it
to
the
captains
of
ten
at
eight
it
commenced
raining
again
but
abated
a
little
before
nine
at
nine
we
commenced
moving
and
after
traveling
of
a
mile
began
to
ascend
the
sandy
bluffs
it
commenced
raining
again
and
it
looks
like
rain
for
all
day
it
is
very
cold
the
wind
continues
strong
the
road
was
much
of
a
zig
zag
over
the
bluffs
but
only
about
a
mile
before
we
descended
to
the
bottom
we
traveled
a
piece
farther
and
at
half
past
ten
it
was
considered
best
to
turn
out
the
teams
until
it
ceases
raining
after
traveling
two
and
a
quarter
miles
we
found
it
unnecessary
to
double
teams
while
crossing
the
bluffs
and
we
got
over
without
difficulty
much
better
than
we
had
anticipated
about
noon
it
again
ceased
raining
and
the
signal
was
given
to
harness
up
teams
at
half
past
twelve
we
proceeded
and
traveled
till
a
quarter
to
three
distance
four
and
a
half
miles
then
formed
the
encampment
in
a
circle
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
river
the
road
has
been
level
but
soft
and
wet
however
not
bad
traveling
the
bluffs
are
about
half
a
mile
to
the
north
and
several
herds
of
buffalo
grazing
on
them
some
of
the
hunters
are
gone
to
try
and
get
some
meat
the
wind
still
keeps
up
and
is
cold
damp
and
uncomfortable
the
feed
appears
better
here
than
we
have
had
for
some
days
and
the
cattle
soon
fill
themselves
which
is
a
comfort
and
blessing
to
the
camp
some
of
the
brethren
have
been
lucky
enough
to
pick
up
a
few
sticks
and
dead
wood
but
our
chief
dependence
for
fuel
is
dry
buffalo
dung
which
abounds
everywhere
but
the
rain
has
injured
it
some
for
burning
about
two
miles
back
we
passed
a
place
where
the
indians
have
lately
camped
during
their
hunt
it
is
plain
that
whole
families
are
amongst
their
number
as
the
foot
prints
and
moccasins
of
children
have
several
times
been
seen
they
evidently
make
use
of
the
buffalo
dung
for
fuel
and
for
seats
they
dig
up
sods
and
lay
them
in
a
circle
around
their
fire
which
is
in
the
center
we
have
passed
a
number
of
these
little
temporary
camping
spots
this
afternoon
the
reason
why
we
did
not
travel
farther
was
that
elder
kimball
being
gone
ahead
to
look
out
the
road
he
found
as
he
came
near
the
next
bluffs
that
the
feed
is
all
eaten
off
by
the
numerous
herds
of
buffalo
and
found
also
that
we
shall
have
to
travel
over
the
bluffs
and
they
appear
wide
and
would
be
impossible
for
the
teams
to
get
over
them
tonight
hence
the
necessity
of
stopping
here
where
we
have
good
feed
the
soil
on
this
prairie
looks
good
and
rich
but
there
is
no
timber
in
fact
there
is
none
in
sight
except
a
small
grove
on
the
other
side
the
river
about
two
miles
west
of
the
camp
late
at
night
porter
rockwell
came
in
and
reported
that
he
killed
a
buffalo
the
cutter
was
sent
for
it
to
bring
it
to
camp
our
course
this
afternoon
nearly
west
sunday
may
morning
fine
but
chilly
and
cold
wind
north
eric
glines
killed
an
antelope
near
the
camp
which
was
cut
up
and
distributed
soon
after
breakfast
president
young
elders
kimball
woodruff
and
benson
went
on
horseback
to
look
out
the
best
road
over
the
bluffs
they
returned
at
half
past
twelve
and
reported
that
we
can
pass
through
a
valley
between
and
around
the
bluffs
which
will
be
about
four
miles
across
them
about
several
buffalo
were
seen
making
their
way
from
the
bluffs
towards
our
horses
some
of
which
were
very
near
them
brother
eric
glines
started
out
with
the
intention
of
driving
the
buffalo
away
and
bringing
the
horses
nearer
camp
when
he
got
near
the
buffalo
did
not
seem
much
disposed
to
move
and
he
shot
at
one
of
them
and
wounded
him
he
moved
a
little
farther
and
brother
glines
followed
him
and
shot
three
times
more
at
him
the
buffalo
then
ran
about
forty
rods
fell
and
soon
expired
i
went
to
look
at
him
he
is
a
large
one
judged
to
weigh
about
pounds
and
in
pretty
good
order
i
left
the
brethren
skinning
him
and
returned
to
camp
where
a
meeting
had
been
called
at
and
the
brethren
addressed
by
elders
richards
markham
rockwood
and
kimball
chiefly
on
the
subject
of
obeying
counsel
and
elder
kimball
remarked
in
regard
to
hunting
on
the
sabbath
he
would
not
do
it
even
in
case
of
necessity
but
he
did
not
feel
disposed
to
find
fault
with
the
brethren
the
laws
and
regulations
for
the
camp
of
april
were
then
read
by
brother
bullock
and
the
meeting
dismissed
about
noon
today
brother
appleton
harmon
completed
the
machinery
on
the
wagon
called
a
roadometer
by
adding
a
wheel
to
revolve
once
in
ten
miles
showing
each
mile
and
also
each
quarter
mile
we
travel
and
then
casing
the
whole
over
so
as
to
secure
it
from
the
weather
we
are
now
prepared
to
tell
accurately
the
distance
we
travel
from
day
to
day
which
will
supersede
the
idea
of
guessing
and
be
a
satisfaction
not
only
to
this
camp
but
to
all
who
hereafter
travel
this
way
i
have
prepared
another
board
to
put
up
here
on
which
the
distance
from
winter
quarters
is
marked
at
miles
i
have
also
written
on
it
that
the
last
seventy
miles
are
measured
and
we
shall
continue
to
measure
and
put
up
guide
posts
as
often
as
circumstances
will
permit
through
the
journey
the
whole
machinery
consists
of
a
shaft
about
inches
long
placed
on
gudgeons
one
in
the
axle
tree
of
the
wagon
near
which
are
six
arms
placed
at
equal
distances
around
it
and
in
which
a
cog
works
which
is
fastened
on
the
hub
of
the
wagon
wheel
turning
the
shaft
once
round
at
every
six
revolutions
of
the
wagon
wheel
the
upper
gudgeon
plays
in
a
piece
of
wood
nailed
to
the
wagon
box
and
near
this
gudgeon
on
the
shaft
a
screw
is
cut
the
shaft
lays
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
in
this
screw
a
wheel
of
sixty
cogs
works
on
an
axle
fixed
in
the
side
of
the
wagon
and
which
makes
one
revolution
each
mile
in
the
shaft
on
which
this
wheel
runs
four
cogs
are
cut
on
the
fore
part
which
plays
in
another
wheel
of
forty
cogs
which
shows
the
miles
and
quarters
to
ten
miles
the
whole
is
cased
over
and
occupies
a
space
of
about
inches
long
inches
high
and
inches
thick
after
the
meeting
was
dismissed
the
cutter
was
sent
to
fetch
the
meat
in
killed
by
brother
glines
they
soon
returned
and
the
meat
was
distributed
as
usual
presidents
young
and
kimball
have
walked
out
together
towards
the
bluffs
after
supper
elder
whipple
made
me
a
present
of
a
half
a
candle
made
from
buffalo
tallow
by
the
light
of
which
i
continue
this
journal
although
as
may
be
expected
the
buffalo
are
generally
poorer
at
this
season
of
the
year
yet
brother
whipple
has
obtained
sufficient
to
make
two
candles
from
his
portion
of
meat
received
yesterday
morning
the
candle
burns
very
clear
and
pleasant
the
tallow
smells
sweet
and
rich
i
imagine
it
has
a
more
pleasant
smell
than
the
tallow
of
domestic
cattle
monday
may
the
morning
very
cold
and
chilly
wind
northwest
richards
left
another
letter
on
the
camp
ground
for
the
benefit
of
the
next
company
the
letter
is
secured
from
the
weather
by
a
wooden
case
and
placed
so
that
the
brethren
can
hardly
miss
finding
it
we
started
on
our
journey
at
after
traveling
a
mile
and
a
half
we
arrived
at
the
foot
of
another
range
of
bluffs
which
extend
to
the
river
and
began
to
ascend
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
north
from
the
river
the
road
also
turning
to
the
north
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
we
crossed
a
stream
of
spring
water
about
three
feet
wide
the
road
for
a
little
distance
on
both
sides
the
stream
is
rough
sandy
and
crooked
we
then
turned
westward
and
passed
over
a
number
of
bluffs
as
there
was
no
chance
to
go
around
them
without
going
miles
out
of
our
course
on
these
sandy
bluffs
there
are
very
many
small
lizards
about
four
or
five
inches
long
from
nose
to
the
end
of
the
tail
which
is
an
inch
and
a
half
long
the
body
looks
short
and
chunky
and
is
of
a
light
grey
color
with
two
rows
of
dark
brown
spots
on
each
side
of
the
body
which
make
it
appear
striped
the
head
is
shaped
something
like
the
head
of
a
snake
they
appear
perfectly
harmless
and
are
pretty
in
appearance
after
traveling
two
and
a
quarter
miles
beyond
the
last
mentioned
stream
we
arrived
at
the
west
foot
of
the
bluffs
the
last
part
of
the
road
very
sandy
and
there
are
several
very
steep
places
of
descent
however
all
the
teams
got
safely
over
without
difficulty
at
the
west
foot
of
the
bluffs
there
appears
more
grass
than
anywhere
we
have
yet
been
although
the
buffalo
have
eaten
it
off
considerably
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
bluffs
we
crossed
two
small
streams
of
spring
water
and
at
a
mile
from
the
foot
of
the
bluffs
we
crossed
a
stream
of
spring
water
about
four
feet
wide
with
a
very
rapid
current
the
whole
of
this
bottom
seems
full
of
springs
and
we
have
to
keep
near
the
bluffs
to
make
a
good
road
to
travel
and
in
fact
we
find
it
more
or
less
soft
and
springy
even
close
to
the
bluffs
a
mile
and
a
quarter
west
of
the
last
mentioned
spring
is
another
small
stream
of
very
clear
spring
water
the
others
are
rather
muddy
by
running
over
sandy
land
they
all
appear
to
have
their
rise
in
the
bluffs
a
short
distance
from
our
road
at
we
stopped
to
feed
having
traveled
this
morning
six
and
three
quarters
miles
our
course
west
weather
fine
warm
and
little
wind
while
we
were
resting
one
of
president
young
horses
in
care
of
phineas
mired
down
in
a
soft
slough
a
number
of
men
soon
collected
and
with
a
rope
dragged
it
out
washed
and
rubbed
it
and
all
was
well
again
latitude
at
two
we
proceeded
onward
after
traveling
a
half
a
mile
we
arrived
at
a
very
shoal
stream
of
clear
water
about
thirty
feet
wide
but
not
over
three
inches
deep
in
the
channel
which
is
about
three
feet
wide
we
forded
it
very
easily
and
then
passed
over
a
short
range
of
low
sandy
bluffs
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
and
then
entered
on
level
prairie
again
but
we
found
it
very
soft
and
springy
within
two
and
a
half
miles
from
the
last
mentioned
stream
we
passed
two
others
one
very
small
the
other
about
four
feet
wide
they
both
doubtless
rise
from
springs
at
the
foot
of
the
bluffs
about
ten
minutes
after
three
word
arrived
that
a
buffalo
was
killed
by
the
hunters
about
a
mile
from
the
road
two
men
were
sent
to
skin
and
dress
it
about
the
same
time
the
revenue
cutter
arrived
with
two
more
buffalo
one
said
to
have
been
killed
by
luke
johnson
and
the
other
by
john
brown
also
an
antelope
killed
by
amasa
lyman
the
wagons
halted
at
a
quarter
to
four
took
the
meat
out
of
the
boat
which
immediately
returned
to
fetch
the
other
buffalo
which
was
killed
by
porter
rockwell
the
meat
was
cut
in
quarters
and
put
into
the
wagons
and
at
half
past
four
we
again
moved
onward
and
traveled
till
and
camped
on
a
nice
dry
bottom
prairie
where
the
grass
is
shorter
than
that
we
have
passed
all
day
we
traveled
this
afternoon
six
miles
and
during
the
day
twelve
and
three
quarters
about
a
west
course
we
are
some
distance
from
water
but
several
wells
were
soon
dug
and
good
water
obtained
at
about
four
feet
deep
soon
after
we
camped
the
boat
came
in
with
the
other
buffalo
and
the
meat
was
all
distributed
equally
around
the
camp
but
it
appears
that
some
have
already
got
more
than
they
need
and
feel
unwilling
to
take
a
good
forequarter
the
bluffs
on
the
opposite
side
the
river
project
to
the
river
for
some
distance
opposite
this
place
latitude
tuesday
may
the
morning
fine
and
very
pleasant
at
seven
the
president
called
the
captains
of
tens
to
his
wagons
and
gave
them
a
pretty
severe
lecture
he
referred
to
some
who
had
left
meat
on
the
ground
and
would
not
use
it
because
it
was
not
hind
quarter
some
would
murmur
because
a
fore
quarter
of
meat
was
alloted
to
them
which
is
not
right
for
god
has
given
us
a
commandment
that
we
should
not
waste
meat
nor
take
life
unless
it
is
needful
but
he
can
see
a
disposition
in
this
camp
to
slaughter
everything
before
them
yea
if
all
the
buffalo
and
game
there
is
on
our
route
were
brought
together
to
the
camp
there
are
some
who
would
never
cease
until
they
had
destroyed
the
whole
some
men
will
shoot
as
much
as
thirty
times
at
a
rabbit
if
they
did
not
kill
it
and
are
continually
wasting
their
ammunition
but
when
they
have
used
all
they
have
got
they
may
have
the
pleasure
of
carrying
their
empty
guns
to
the
mountains
and
back
for
he
will
not
furnish
them
we
have
now
meat
enough
to
last
some
time
if
we
will
take
proper
care
of
it
as
to
the
horsemen
there
are
none
with
the
exception
of
brothers
kimball
woodruff
and
benson
that
ever
take
the
trouble
to
look
out
a
good
road
for
the
wagons
but
all
they
seem
to
care
about
is
to
wait
till
their
breakfast
is
cooked
for
them
and
when
they
have
eaten
it
they
mount
their
horses
and
scatter
away
and
if
an
antelope
comes
across
the
track
the
whole
of
us
must
be
stopped
perhaps
half
an
hour
while
they
try
to
creep
up
near
enough
to
kill
it
but
when
we
come
to
a
bad
place
on
the
route
all
the
interest
they
have
is
to
get
across
the
best
they
can
and
leave
myself
and
one
or
two
others
to
pick
out
a
crossing
place
and
guide
the
camp
all
the
time
such
things
are
not
right
and
he
wants
them
to
cease
and
all
take
an
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
camp
be
united
and
receive
the
meat
as
a
blessing
from
god
and
not
as
a
stink
offering
from
the
devil
it
is
not
necessary
to
preach
to
the
elders
in
this
camp
they
know
what
is
right
as
well
as
he
does
and
he
will
not
preach
to
them
all
the
time
let
the
captains
do
the
best
they
know
how
and
teach
their
men
to
do
likewise
the
meeting
dispersed
the
meat
was
taken
care
of
and
at
a
quarter
past
eight
we
started
out
again
and
traveled
three
and
a
quarter
miles
nearly
a
west
course
over
a
very
hard
prairie
and
good
traveling
and
then
arrived
at
a
nice
stream
rattlesnake
creek
about
twenty
or
feet
wide
a
foot
or
inches
deep
and
a
very
strong
current
this
stream
must
take
its
rise
some
distance
back
in
the
bluffs
or
else
is
supplied
from
many
strong
springs
for
there
is
much
water
comes
down
it
we
traveled
on
from
this
near
the
bank
of
the
river
about
a
northwest
course
over
tolerably
rough
land
till
and
then
stopped
to
feed
having
come
six
and
a
half
miles
this
morning
the
weather
very
hot
opposite
the
stream
last
mentioned
on
the
south
side
the
river
are
several
pine
groves
or
rather
cedar
groves
there
is
some
little
pine
wood
such
as
knots
and
dead
branches
that
can
be
picked
up
on
the
banks
of
the
river
it
has
floated
from
above
this
with
a
little
buffalo
chips
makes
a
good
fire
for
cooking
latitude
noon
rattlesnake
creek
was
so
named
from
the
following
incident
president
young
as
he
rode
up
to
the
banks
of
the
creek
discovered
that
his
horse
stepped
within
a
foot
of
a
very
large
rattlesnake
he
turned
his
horse
away
without
harming
it
soon
afterward
one
of
the
brethren
came
up
on
foot
and
stepped
within
two
feet
and
a
half
of
it
it
immediately
coiled
up
and
sprang
at
him
and
would
have
struck
him
as
it
sprang
feet
had
he
not
jumped
to
one
side
he
took
his
rifle
and
shot
the
snake
dead
the
head
of
cedar
bluffs
as
named
by
fremont
is
three
miles
west
of
where
we
camped
last
night
at
we
continued
our
journey
our
route
lay
near
the
banks
of
the
river
which
seems
narrower
here
after
traveling
three
and
a
half
miles
we
crossed
a
stream
about
six
feet
wide
and
three
quarters
of
a
mile
farther
another
stream
of
tolerably
deep
clear
water
about
five
feet
wide
this
stream
is
very
crooked
and
seems
to
run
from
the
bluffs
to
the
river
in
a
perfect
serpentine
or
zig
zag
direction
soon
after
starting
this
afternoon
we
discovered
some
dog
towns
the
grass
eaten
perfectly
bare
all
around
the
feed
is
growing
worse
again
evidently
eaten
up
by
the
buffalo
at
noon
a
heavy
black
cloud
arose
in
the
west
and
we
had
a
little
rain
accompanied
by
lightning
and
distant
thunder
after
passing
the
last
mentioned
creek
about
a
mile
we
had
to
change
our
course
to
nearly
northwest
on
account
of
a
bend
in
the
river
we
traveled
till
and
formed
our
encampment
on
the
west
bank
of
a
running
stream
about
eight
feet
wide
and
one
foot
deep
which
is
five
miles
from
the
crooked
creek
making
our
afternoon
travel
nine
and
a
quarter
miles
and
the
day
travel
fifteen
and
three
quarters
the
bluffs
and
the
river
here
are
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
apart
the
river
very
wide
feed
poor
plenty
of
float
wood
pine
and
cedar
for
fuel
the
weather
calm
and
warm
though
cloudy
after
encampment
was
formed
went
with
elder
orson
pratt
to
richards
wagon
to
enter
into
arrangements
for
making
a
map
of
our
route
the
doctor
wants
me
to
do
it
assisted
by
elder
pratt
observations
he
handed
me
fremont
map
and
i
retired
to
my
wagon
to
commence
operations
but
soon
found
that
the
map
does
not
agree
with
my
scale
nor
elder
pratt
calculations
i
then
proposed
to
elder
pratt
to
wait
until
we
get
through
the
journey
and
take
all
the
necessary
data
and
then
make
a
new
one
instead
of
making
our
route
on
fremont
the
subject
is
left
here
till
morning
after
supper
i
took
my
candle
and
finished
this
day
journal
at
dark
colonel
markham
called
the
camp
together
to
tell
the
brethren
their
duty
in
regard
to
traveling
guarding
teams
and
standing
guard
at
nights
the
old
laws
of
april
were
talked
over
and
additional
added
but
not
being
present
i
did
not
hear
them
neither
can
i
learn
anything
from
those
who
were
present
for
they
all
say
that
there
were
so
many
little
matters
touched
upon
and
so
many
resolutions
passed
that
they
remembered
only
one
and
that
is
when
any
man
goes
out
of
the
sound
of
the
horn
to
fetch
in
his
team
and
sees
another
man
horse
or
mule
or
ox
a
little
beyond
or
near
his
he
shall
drive
it
also
to
camp
and
if
he
neglect
to
do
so
he
shall
be
sent
back
to
do
it
even
if
it
requires
an
escort
to
make
him
about
seven
the
wind
shifted
around
to
the
north
and
blew
strong
and
cold
wednesday
may
it
has
rained
a
little
most
of
the
night
and
still
looks
gloomy
cloudy
and
like
for
a
rainy
day
inasmuch
as
the
feed
is
not
good
here
it
was
thought
best
to
move
on
before
breakfast
a
few
miles
and
seek
better
feed
we
started
out
at
the
second
division
having
the
right
to
lead
but
a
part
of
the
first
division
being
ready
a
little
before
all
the
second
were
ready
they
rushed
on
their
teams
drove
fast
and
those
of
the
second
division
behind
had
to
leave
the
track
and
run
their
teams
to
take
their
places
we
traveled
two
and
three
quarters
miles
our
course
eleven
and
one
fourth
degrees
north
of
west
and
then
crossed
a
stream
three
feet
wide
and
one
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
crossed
another
four
feet
wide
our
route
lay
within
about
one
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
bluffs
and
a
mile
from
the
river
which
takes
a
bend
south
from
where
we
camped
last
night
and
runs
close
to
the
bluffs
on
the
south
side
we
then
turned
our
course
to
a
little
west
of
northwest
as
the
river
bends
again
to
the
bluffs
on
this
side
and
traveled
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
and
halted
for
breakfast
at
having
traveled
three
and
a
quarter
miles
the
main
body
of
the
camp
have
stopped
a
quarter
of
a
mile
back
being
three
miles
from
where
we
started
this
morning
the
road
is
mostly
sandy
tall
grass
of
last
year
growth
the
two
streams
we
passed
seem
to
form
many
ponds
of
clear
water
extending
at
short
distances
from
each
other
from
the
bluffs
to
the
river
elder
kimball
has
been
ahead
over
the
bluffs
to
look
out
the
road
it
continues
to
rain
a
little
occasionally
with
light
north
wind
elder
kimball
found
that
the
bluffs
project
entirely
to
the
river
and
are
very
sandy
but
we
can
cross
them
without
going
out
of
our
course
at
twenty
minutes
to
nine
we
proceeded
onward
a
little
and
then
waited
till
the
rest
of
the
wagons
came
up
at
the
distance
of
nearly
a
mile
and
a
half
we
crossed
a
stream
about
twenty
feet
wide
not
very
deep
neither
very
good
to
cross
and
exactly
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
we
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
bluffs
and
began
to
ascend
without
doubling
teams
some
of
the
teams
stuck
by
but
by
the
assistance
of
the
extra
men
they
all
got
up
the
bluffs
are
very
high
sandy
and
rough
and
the
sand
cuts
down
considerably
making
it
heavy
on
teams
these
bluffs
are
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
east
foot
to
the
west
foot
following
our
trail
which
is
nearly
straight
about
yards
from
the
west
foot
of
the
bluffs
we
crossed
another
stream
five
feet
wide
it
has
rained
heavily
all
the
time
since
we
started
after
breakfast
and
continues
consequently
at
half
past
ten
the
camp
formed
into
platoons
and
then
halted
to
wait
for
more
favorable
weather
having
traveled
six
miles
today
over
the
worst
road
we
have
had
from
winter
quarters
rendered
worse
doubtless
by
the
heavy
rains
about
half
past
two
the
weather
looked
a
little
more
favorable
and
orders
were
given
to
move
on
we
started
at
five
minutes
to
three
about
which
time
it
again
rained
heavily
we
traveled
two
miles
and
then
formed
our
encampment
in
a
on
the
banks
of
the
river
having
traveled
two
miles
and
through
the
day
eight
miles
the
first
mile
this
evening
was
over
very
soft
prairie
the
last
hard
and
good
the
rain
still
continues
to
pour
down
heavily
and
this
has
been
the
most
uncomfortable
day
we
have
had
and
the
hardest
on
our
teams
the
brethren
however
feel
well
and
cheerful
the
ox
teams
are
improving
in
their
condition
but
the
horses
do
not
stand
it
as
well
the
stream
at
the
east
foot
of
the
last
mentioned
bluffs
was
named
wolf
creek
from
the
following
circumstance
when
elder
kimball
went
ahead
this
morning
to
search
out
a
road
he
went
up
the
creek
about
a
mile
and
around
over
the
bluffs
to
find
if
possible
a
better
road
than
the
one
close
to
the
river
while
he
was
searching
about
a
mile
north
from
the
river
he
went
down
into
a
deep
hollow
surrounded
by
high
bluffs
and
as
he
was
riding
along
at
the
bottom
he
turned
his
head
to
the
left
and
saw
two
very
large
wolves
at
about
five
rods
distance
gazing
at
him
one
of
them
he
said
was
nearly
as
large
as
a
two
year
old
steer
when
he
saw
these
he
looked
around
on
the
other
side
and
saw
several
others
about
the
same
distance
from
him
very
large
ones
and
all
gazing
fiercely
at
him
this
startled
him
considerably
and
more
especially
when
he
reflected
that
he
had
no
arms
he
made
a
noise
to
try
to
scare
them
away
but
they
still
stood
and
he
concluded
to
move
away
as
soon
as
he
could
they
did
not
follow
him
and
he
saw
a
dead
carcass
near
which
satisfied
him
that
he
had
interrupted
their
repast
on
mentioning
this
circumstance
to
president
young
they
named
the
creek
wolf
creek
he
traveled
back
and
forth
over
ten
miles
searching
out
a
road
before
breakfast
he
also
went
out
again
afterwards
and
got
badly
wet
he
then
concluded
to
change
his
clothing
and
remain
in
his
wagon
the
evening
is
very
cool
and
cloudy
with
wind
from
the
northeast
the
rain
had
ceased
about
six
but
it
still
looks
stormy
thursday
may
the
morning
fair
but
cloudy
light
wind
from
northwest
and
cold
at
we
started
out
again
but
had
not
traveled
over
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
the
roadometer
gave
way
on
account
of
the
rain
yesterday
having
caused
the
wood
to
swell
and
stick
fast
one
of
the
cogs
in
the
small
wheel
broke
we
stopped
about
a
half
an
hour
and
appleton
harmon
took
it
to
pieces
and
put
it
up
again
without
the
small
wheel
i
had
to
count
each
mile
after
this
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
where
we
camped
we
crossed
a
creek
eight
feet
wide
and
two
and
a
half
feet
deep
we
then
changed
our
course
to
about
southwest
a
mile
or
so
following
the
banks
of
the
river
as
the
ground
was
wet
and
swampy
nearer
the
bluffs
the
river
then
winds
around
about
three
miles
in
a
bend
and
then
strikes
a
little
north
of
west
the
bluffs
on
the
north
appear
to
be
about
two
miles
from
the
river
we
traveled
till
and
then
halted
to
feed
having
traveled
seven
and
three
quarters
miles
over
tolerably
good
road
though
at
the
commencement
somewhat
soft
on
the
opposite
side
the
river
the
bluffs
project
near
its
banks
they
are
rocky
and
almost
perpendicular
beautified
for
miles
by
groves
of
cedar
opposite
to
where
we
are
halted
we
can
see
a
ravine
running
up
the
bluffs
and
at
the
foot
a
flat
bottom
of
about
fifteen
acres
at
the
farther
side
of
this
bottom
is
a
grove
of
trees
not
yet
in
leaf
brother
brown
thinks
they
are
ash
and
that
the
place
is
what
is
called
ash
hollow
and
on
fremont
map
ash
creek
we
all
felt
anxious
to
ascertain
the
fact
whether
this
is
ash
hollow
or
not
for
if
it
is
the
oregon
trail
strikes
the
river
at
this
place
and
if
it
can
be
ascertained
that
such
is
the
fact
we
then
have
a
better
privilege
of
testing
fremont
distances
to
laramie
we
have
already
discovered
that
his
map
is
not
altogether
correct
in
several
respects
and
particularly
in
showing
the
windings
of
the
river
and
the
distance
of
the
bluffs
from
it
i
suggested
the
propriety
of
some
persons
going
over
in
the
boat
and
brother
john
brown
suggested
it
to
president
young
the
boat
was
soon
hauled
by
the
brethren
to
the
river
and
orson
pratt
amasa
lyman
luke
johnson
and
john
brown
started
to
row
over
but
the
current
was
so
exceedingly
strong
the
oars
had
no
effect
john
brown
then
jumped
into
the
river
which
was
about
two
and
a
half
feet
deep
and
dragged
the
boat
over
the
others
assisting
with
the
oars
after
some
hard
labor
they
arrived
on
the
opposite
shore
and
went
to
the
hollow
they
soon
found
the
oregon
trail
and
ascertained
that
this
is
ash
hollow
brother
brown
having
traveled
on
that
road
to
near
laramie
last
season
with
the
mississippi
company
and
knew
the
place
perfectly
well
they
gathered
some
branches
of
wild
cherry
in
full
bloom
rambled
over
the
place
a
little
while
and
then
returned
to
camp
about
the
same
time
the
camp
prepared
to
pursue
their
journey
the
brethren
arrived
and
made
their
report
and
at
we
proceeded
onward
from
the
appearance
of
the
bluffs
ahead
our
course
this
afternoon
will
be
west
and
northwest
a
light
breeze
from
northwest
soon
after
we
started
one
of
the
brethren
killed
a
large
rattlesnake
within
a
rod
of
the
road
made
by
the
wagons
and
on
the
side
where
the
cows
travel
he
killed
it
to
prevent
its
injuring
the
cows
and
threw
it
away
from
the
road
in
the
river
one
and
a
quarter
miles
above
ash
hollow
there
are
several
small
islands
on
which
grow
many
trees
of
cedar
one
of
these
islands
is
perfectly
green
over
with
cedar
and
looks
beautiful
the
bluffs
also
on
the
south
side
the
river
continue
to
be
lined
with
cedar
apparently
for
two
miles
yet
and
are
very
high
and
almost
perpendicular
running
pretty
close
to
the
river
on
this
side
the
river
the
bluffs
seem
to
bear
farther
to
the
north
being
apparently
about
three
miles
from
the
river
and
a
few
miles
farther
west
they
are
as
much
as
five
miles
from
the
river
after
traveling
three
and
a
quarter
miles
from
the
noon
stop
we
crossed
a
tributary
stream
running
into
the
platte
in
a
very
crooked
direction
being
from
four
to
eight
rods
wide
and
two
and
a
half
feet
deep
most
of
the
way
across
the
bottom
quick
sand
current
rapid
and
water
of
sandy
color
like
the
platte
some
had
to
double
teams
to
get
over
but
all
got
over
safely
we
proceeded
on
about
four
miles
farther
and
found
that
the
river
bends
considerably
to
the
north
the
bluffs
also
bend
to
the
south
so
that
the
low
bluffs
in
front
almost
reach
the
banks
only
barely
leaving
room
for
a
road
we
went
a
little
farther
and
camped
for
the
night
at
half
past
five
having
traveled
this
afternoon
eight
miles
making
fifteen
and
three
quarters
miles
during
the
day
elder
kimball
and
several
others
went
forward
on
horses
to
pick
out
our
road
as
usual
i
have
seen
several
kinds
of
herbs
growing
today
which
appear
new
to
me
one
looks
like
penny
royal
smells
almost
like
it
but
tastes
hot
and
like
the
oil
of
cloves
elder
kimball
and
others
saw
a
very
large
wolf
about
half
a
mile
west
and
he
appeared
to
be
following
them
to
camp
they
turned
and
rode
up
to
him
and
round
him
struck
their
pistols
at
him
but
they
did
not
go
off
being
damp
he
finally
made
his
escape
the
large
stream
we
crossed
this
afternoon
is
named
castle
creek
from
the
bluffs
on
the
opposite
side
which
much
resemble
the
rock
on
which
lancaster
castle
is
built
the
bluffs
are
named
castle
bluffs
we
had
a
light
shower
this
afternoon
but
the
evening
is
fine
though
very
cool
friday
may
the
morning
very
fine
and
pleasant
though
tolerably
cold
i
put
up
a
guide
board
at
this
place
with
the
following
inscriptions
on
it
from
winter
quarters
miles
from
the
junction
of

may
according
to
fremont
this
place
is
miles
from
laramie
b
the
bluffs
opposite
are
named
castle
bluffs
at
we
continued
our
journey
we
found
the
prairie
tolerably
wet
many
ponds
of
water
standing
which
must
have
been
caused
by
a
heavy
fall
of
rain
much
more
heavy
than
we
had
back
however
it
was
not
very
bad
traveling
we
made
a
pretty
straight
road
this
morning
at
about
the
distance
of
a
mile
from
the
river
the
bluffs
on
the
north
appear
to
be
five
miles
or
over
from
our
road
at
we
halted
for
dinner
having
traveled
nearly
seven
and
three
quarters
miles

north
of
northwest
very
warm
and
no
wind
presidents
young
and
kimball
rode
forward
to
pick
the
road
and
near
this
place
they
saw
a
nest
of
wolves
caught
and
killed
two
with
sticks
four
or
five
others
escaped
to
their
hole
at
half
past
one
we
proceeded
onward
and
found
the
prairie
wet
and
grass
high
of
last
year
growth
after
traveling
four
and
three
quarters
miles
we
arrived
at
a
range
of
low
bluffs
projecting
to
the
river
which
at
this
place
bends
to
the
north
there
is
however
bottom
of
about
a
rod
wide
between
the
bluffs
and
the
river
but
as
it
is
wet
and
soft
it
was
preferred
to
cross
over
the
bluffs
by
bending
a
little
more
to
the
north
we
traveled
on
the
bluffs
a
little
over
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
then
turned
on
the
bottom
again
the
bluffs
are
low
and
almost
as
level
as
the
bottom
after
we
crossed
the
bluffs
we
found
the
road
better
we
saw
about
a
mile
this
side
of
the
foot
of
the
bluffs
a
very
large
bone
almost
petrified
into
stone
most
of
the
brethren
believe
it
to
be
the
shoulder
bone
of
a
mammoth
and
is
very
large
indeed
about
this
time
a
badger
was
brought
to
the
wagons
which
brother
woodruff
had
killed
as
i
was
walking
along
and
looking
over
the
river
i
heard
a
rattlesnake
and
looking
down
saw
that
i
had
stepped
within
a
foot
of
it
it
rattled
hard
but
seemed
to
make
away
we
threw
it
away
from
the
track
without
killing
it
at
five
elder
kimball
rode
up
and
stopped
the
forward
teams
till
the
last
ones
got
nearer
saying
that
some
indians
had
come
down
from
the
bluffs
to
the
brethren
ahead
when
the
rest
of
the
wagons
came
up
we
moved
on
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
and
at
half
past
five
formed
our
encampment
in
a
circle
with
the
wagons
close
together
as
possible
having
traveled
seven
and
three
quarters
miles
this
afternoon
making
fifteen
and
a
half
through
the
day
as
the
camp
was
forming
the
two
indians
came
nearer
being
a
man
and
his
squaw
they
represented
by
signs
that
they
were
sioux
and
that
a
party
of
them
are
now
on
the
bluffs
north
of
us
and
not
far
distant
by
the
aid
of
glasses
we
could
see
several
on
the
bluffs
with
their
ponies
evidently
watching
our
movements
this
man
was
hunting
when
first
seen
and
appeared
afraid
when
he
saw
the
brethren
the
squaw
fled
for
the
bluffs
as
fast
as
her
horse
could
go
but
by
signs
made
to
them
they
gathered
courage
and
came
up
president
young
gave
orders
not
to
bring
them
into
camp
and
they
soon
rode
off
to
the
bluffs
the
man
has
got
a
good
cloth
coat
on
and
appears
well
dressed
the
horses
they
rode
are
said
to
be
work
horses
which
makes
us
suspect
they
have
stolen
them
from
travelers
the
day
has
been
very
warm
and
some
of
the
teams
gave
out
we
can
see
some
timber
on
the
bluffs
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
some
miles
ahead
which
is
the
first
timber
we
have
seen
for
more
than
a
week
except
some
small
cedar
and
the
timber
in
ash
hollow
all
on
the
south
side
the
river
we
are
nearly
a
mile
from
water
and
the
brethren
have
to
dig
wells
to
obtain
a
supply
for
cooking
the
feed
here
is
very
poor
not
much
but
old
grass
our
course
this
afternoon
has
been
a
little
north
of
west
lorenzo
young
shot
two
very
large
ducks
with
one
ball
and
brought
them
to
camp
elder
kimball
proposed
tonight
that
i
should
leave
a
number
of
pages
for
so
much
of
his
journal
as
i
am
behind
in
copying
and
start
from
the
present
and
keep
it
up
daily
he
furnished
me
a
candle
and
i
wrote
the
journal
of
this
day
travel
by
candle
light
in
his
journal
leaving
pages
blank
the
evening
was
very
fine
and
pleasant
the
latitude
at
noon
halt
saturday
may
morning
beautiful
no
wind
and
warm
we
have
not
been
disturbed
by
the
indians
all
is
peace
in
the
camp
at
eight
we
continued
our
journey
making
a
more
crooked
road
than
usual
having
to
bend
south
to
near
the
banks
of
the
river
the
prairie
somewhat
soft
and
a
little
uneven
after
traveling
five
and
a
half
miles
we
crossed
a
very
shoal
creek
about
twenty
feet
wide
the
bluffs
and
river
about
a
mile
apart
but
on
the
other
side
the
bluffs
recede
two
miles
back
from
the
river
and
have
lost
their
craggy
and
steep
appearance
the
ascent
being
gradual
while
on
this
side
they
begin
to
be
rocky
cragged
and
almost
perpendicular
though
not
very
high
we
traveled
till
half
past
eleven
and
then
halted
for
noon
having
traveled
seven
and
a
quarter
miles
the
road
on
this
side
the
creek
being
better
our
course
about
west
of
northwest
with
a
light
breeze
from
the
east
elder
kimball
and
others
ahead
as
usual
the
creek
above
mentioned
was
named
crab
creek
because
some
of
the
brethren
saw
a
very
large
crab
in
it
a
mile
east
of
this
creek
is
a
dry
creek
down
which
from
appearances
a
heavy
stream
runs
at
some
seasons
of
the
year
perhaps
during
heavy
storms
the
water
running
from
the
bluffs
swells
it
to
a
considerable
height
and
it
is
certain
there
are
tremendous
storms
here
a
while
after
we
halted
porter
rockwell
came
in
and
said
he
had
been
on
the
high
bluff
about
a
mile
northwest
of
us
and
had
seen
the
rock
called
chimney
rock
which
appeared
a
long
distance
off
we
have
been
in
hopes
to
come
in
sight
of
it
today
and
feel
anxious
in
order
to
ascertain
more
certainly
the
correctness
of
fremont
distance
in
order
to
satisfy
myself
although
my
feet
were
blistered
and
very
sore
i
determined
to
take
my
telescope
and
go
on
the
bluff
to
ascertain
for
myself
whether
the
noted
rock
could
be
seen
or
not
at
half
past
twelve
i
started
out
alone
i
found
the
distance
to
the
foot
of
the
bluff
a
good
mile
the
ascent
gradual
from
the
foot
the
bluff
looks
very
high
and
rough
many
huge
rocks
having
broken
from
the
summit
from
time
to
time
and
rolled
down
a
long
distance
i
found
the
ascent
very
steep
and
lengthy
in
comparison
to
its
appearance
from
camp
when
i
arrived
on
the
top
i
found
a
nice
slightly
arched
surface
of
about
a
quarter
of
an
acre
in
extent
but
barren
and
very
little
grass
on
it
huge
comparatively
smooth
rocks
peeped
through
the
surface
on
one
of
which
i
wrote
with
red
chalk
wm
clayton
may
on
the
highest
point
i
sat
down
and
took
a
view
of
the
surrounding
country
which
is
magnificent
indeed
on
the
south
at
the
distance
of
two
miles
from
the
river
there
is
a
range
of
cedar
trees
on
the
bluffs
which
very
much
resemble
some
of
the
parks
and
seats
of
gentry
in
england
east
i
could
see
where
we
camped
last
night
the
high
grass
still
burning
northeast
north
and
northwest
alternately
appeared
high
swelling
bluffs
and
valleys
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
or
the
glass
magnify
west
the
course
of
the
platte
for
ten
or
fifteen
miles
and
at
about
four
or
five
miles
distance
a
large
bend
to
the
north
brings
it
in
contact
with
the
bluffs
on
this
side
at
the
distance
i
should
judge
of
about
twenty
miles
i
could
see
chimney
rock
very
plainly
with
the
naked
eye
which
from
here
very
much
resembles
the
large
factory
chimneys
in
england
although
i
could
not
see
the
form
of
its
base
the
rock
lay
about
due
west
from
here
after
gratifying
my
curiosity
and
seeing
the
men
collecting
their
teams
for
a
march
i
descended
on
the
west
side
of
the
bluff
the
descent
at
this
point
looks
more
alarming
than
on
the
other
the
side
being
very
steep
and
all
along
huge
rocks
standing
so
critically
that
to
all
appearance
a
waft
of
wind
would
precipitate
them
to
the
prairie
below
with
tremendous
force
in
one
place
in
particular
a
ponderous
mass
of
rock
appears
to
hang
from
the
edge
of
the
bluff
without
any
visible
means
of
being
retained
in
its
position
and
by
gazing
at
it
a
little
while
it
is
easy
to
imagine
you
can
see
it
move
and
ready
to
overwhelm
you
instantly
at
a
little
distance
from
the
base
of
the
bluff
i
turned
to
gaze
on
the
romantic
scenery
above
and
was
struck
at
the
appearance
of
a
large
rock
projecting
from
one
corner
which
very
much
resembled
a
frog
head
of
immense
size
with
its
mouth
part
open
the
thought
was
those
bluffs
ought
to
be
named
and
what
name
more
appropriate
than
frog
head
bluffs
after
this
reflection
i
walked
on
to
where
i
thought
the
wagons
would
come
which
started
out
at
half
past
one
after
traveling
three
and
a
quarter
miles
we
crossed
a
dry
creek
about
six
rods
wide
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
another
about
five
feet
wide
and
a
half
a
mile
farther
still
another
about
six
rods
wide
on
an
average
these
all
appear
to
be
the
sources
of
heavy
streams
of
water
at
some
seasons
of
the
year
soon
as
we
crossed
this
last
one
i
saw
elder
kimball
wave
his
hat
for
the
wagons
to
turn
off
to
the
north
in
order
to
cross
the
bluffs
which
struck
the
river
a
little
farther
but
a
little
to
the
west
was
a
very
high
ridge
and
i
concluded
to
walk
on
to
it
found
it
to
be
a
perfect
ridge
of
gravel
very
high
and
rounding
on
the
top
not
more
than
four
or
five
feet
wide
and
from
north
to
south
about
feet
long
elder
pratt
names
this
cobble
hills
the
gravel
or
cobbles
varying
in
size
of
from
fifty
pounds
in
weight
to
the
smallest
pebble
at
the
north
foot
of
this
hill
is
what
might
be
named
a
clay
bank
being
composed
of
a
light
colored
kind
of
sandy
clay
and
forms
a
kind
of
large
table
a
little
distance
farther
we
crossed
another
dry
creek
about
eight
rods
wide
and
then
ascended
the
bluffs
the
ascent
is
pretty
steep
for
nearly
half
a
mile
but
hard
and
not
difficult
to
travel
the
wagon
had
to
wind
about
some
to
keep
around
the
foot
of
the
bluffs
crossing
the
dry
creek
three
times
before
we
emerged
from
the
bluffs
to
the
banks
of
the
river
we
crossed
another
dry
creek
pretty
steep
on
each
side
and
then
found
ourselves
once
more
on
the
prairie
bottom
the
bluffs
are
two
and
a
quarter
miles
from
the
east
to
the
west
foot
following
our
trail
the
wind
has
blown
from
the
southeast
all
day
until
lately
when
a
dead
calm
has
succeeded
in
the
west
a
heavy
thunder
cloud
has
been
gathering
for
two
hours
and
vivid
streaks
of
lightning
observed
in
the
distance
at
twenty
minutes
to
five
the
wind
struck
suddenly
from
the
northwest
the
blackest
part
of
the
cloud
then
lying
in
that
direction
we
had
a
few
drops
of
rain
only
then
it
seemed
to
turn
off
to
the
east
the
scenery
after
this
was
indeed
sublime
the
sun
peering
out
from
under
the
heavy
clouds
reflecting
long
rays
upwards
which
were
imitated
in
the
east
the
romantic
bluffs
on
the
north
and
the
lightning
playing
in
the
southeast
all
tended
to
fill
my
mind
with
pleasant
reflections
on
the
goodness
and
majesty
of
the
creator
and
governor
of
the
universe
and
the
beauty
of
the
works
of
his
hands
at
we
formed
our
encampment
in
a
circle
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
banks
of
the
river
having
traveled
this
afternoon
eight
and
a
quarter
miles
and
through
the
day
fifteen
and
a
half
making
the
distance
from
winter
quarters
miles
in
five
weeks
and
three
and
a
half
days
the
feed
on
the
lower
bench
of
the
prairie
is
tolerably
good
while
the
higher
land
is
quite
bare
we
have
noticed
today
a
great
many
petrified
bones
some
very
large
all
are
turned
into
solid
hard
stone
which
proves
that
the
atmosphere
is
pure
and
the
country
would
doubtless
be
healthy
but
is
not
adapted
for
farming
purposes
on
account
of
the
poor
sandy
soil
and
no
timber
at
all
on
this
side
the
river
i
have
noticed
a
variety
of
shrubs
plants
and
flowers
all
new
to
me
today
many
of
which
have
a
very
pleasant
smell
and
in
some
places
the
air
appears
impregnated
with
the
rich
odors
arising
from
them
among
the
rest
are
numerous
beds
of
the
southern
wood
there
are
also
vast
beds
of
flinty
pebbles
of
various
colors
some
as
white
as
alabaster
about
i
observed
a
group
of
brethren
standing
together
inside
the
camp
i
went
up
and
saw
a
young
eagle
which
had
been
taken
out
of
its
nest
on
one
of
these
high
bluffs
by
george
grant
and
orson
whitney
although
it
is
very
young
and
its
feathers
have
scarcely
commenced
growing
it
measures
from
the
tips
of
its
wings
when
stretched
inches
its
head
is
nearly
the
size
of
my
fist
and
looks
very
ferocious
after
this
i
went
with
john
pack
and
horace
whitney
to
the
bluffs
on
our
way
we
saw
a
large
wolf
about
as
large
as
the
largest
dog
in
camp
he
was
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
camp
after
traveling
about
a
mile
we
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
stupendous
mass
of
rocks
almost
perpendicular
with
only
one
place
where
it
was
possible
to
ascend
we
went
up
with
difficulty
and
by
using
our
hands
and
knees
gained
the
top
we
had
to
walk
over
a
little
space
which
was
only
about
three
feet
wide
and
on
the
east
side
a
perpendicular
fall
of
about
sixty
feet
although
from
the
camp
this
peak
looks
only
large
enough
for
a
man
to
stand
upon
we
found
it
large
enough
to
seat
comfortably
about
twenty
persons
the
top
is
composed
of
large
rocks
and
very
uneven
the
prairie
below
looks
a
long
distance
under
foot
from
this
peak
descending
we
viewed
the
surrounding
scenery
which
looks
more
like
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
city
with
its
castles
towers
fortifications
on
all
sides
and
a
dry
stream
coming
through
the
center
we
proceeded
to
the
next
high
rock
and
found
it
very
difficult
of
ascent
the
top
is
nearly
level
and
very
pleasant
we
discovered
several
other
varieties
of
shrubbery
all
smelling
pleasant
and
strong
we
saw
that
a
horse
has
sometime
stood
on
the
top
but
how
he
got
there
we
could
not
easily
determine
at
the
east
end
there
is
a
cedar
tree
flat
on
the
top
and
on
the
underside
almost
looks
like
an
umbrella
we
made
a
calculation
of
the
height
of
this
bluff
as
well
as
we
could
and
concluded
it
must
be
at
least
feet
higher
than
the
river
the
surrounding
country
can
be
seen
for
many
miles
from
its
summit
and
chimney
rock
shows
very
plainly
we
descended
at
the
east
end
and
arrived
in
camp
at
dark
well
satisfied
with
our
journey
some
of
the
brethren
have
discovered
a
cave
in
one
of
these
bluffs
and
one
went
into
it
a
little
distance
but
it
being
very
dark
and
having
no
torch
he
did
not
venture
far
elder
pratt
reports
that
he
saw
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
bluffs
a
hole
in
a
rock
inches
in
diameter
and
a
foot
deep
with
five
inches
of
very
cold
good
water
in
it
he
supposed
it
to
be
a
spring
between
the
bluffs
they
also
discovered
a
spring
of
pure
cold
water
of
a
very
good
taste
richards
names
these
bluffs
bluff
ruins
from
their
appearance
being
that
of
the
ruins
of
castles
cities
etc
a
little
to
the
left
is
a
small
perpendicular
rock
much
resembling
chimney
rock
but
smaller
the
whole
of
the
scenery
around
is
one
of
romantic
beauty
which
can
not
be
described
with
either
pen
or
tongue
last
night
a
large
black
dog
half
wolf
supposed
to
belong
to
the
indians
came
to
the
camp
he
has
kept
within
two
hundred
yards
of
the
wagons
all
day
and
has
followed
us
to
this
place
there
have
been
many
rattlesnakes
seen
today
and
six
or
seven
killed
in
fact
this
place
seems
to
abound
with
them
the
evening
was
spent
very
joyfully
by
most
of
the
brethren
it
being
very
pleasant
and
moonlight
a
number
danced
till
the
bugle
sounded
for
bed
time
at
nine
a
mock
trial
was
also
prosecuted
in
the
case
of
the
camp
james
davenport
for
blockading
the
highway
and
turning
ladies
out
of
their
course
jackson
redding
acted
as
the
presiding
judge
elder
whipple
attorney
for
defendant
and
luke
johnson
attorney
for
the
people
we
have
many
such
trials
in
the
camp
which
are
amusing
enough
and
tend
among
other
things
to
pass
away
the
time
cheerfully
during
leisure
moments
it
was
remarked
this
evening
that
we
have
one
man
in
camp
who
is
entitled
to
the
credit
of
being
more
even
tempered
than
any
of
the
others
and
that
is
father
chamberlain
he
is
invariably
cross
and
quarrelsome
but
the
brethren
all
take
it
as
a
joke
and
he
makes
considerable
amusement
for
the
camp
opposite
the
encampment
there
are
quite
a
number
of
small
islands
but
no
timber
on
any
of
them
sunday
may
the
morning
very
fine
and
pleasant
brother
egan
commenced
washing
very
early
on
the
banks
of
the
river
he
kindly
volunteered
to
wash
my
dirty
clothing
which
i
accepted
as
a
favor
after
breakfast
president
young
elders
kimball
richards
pratt
woodruff
smith
and
benson
and
lyman
walked
out
to
view
bluff
ruins
and
returned
at
half
past
eleven
a
while
ago
i
went
out
a
little
distance
to
view
an
adder
which
george
billings
had
discovered
it
was
a
dark
brown
color
about
inches
long
and
three
quarters
of
an
inch
thick
through
the
body
they
are
represented
as
very
poisonous
about
eleven
nathaniel
fairbanks
came
into
camp
having
been
bitten
in
the
leg
by
a
rattlesnake
he
went
on
the
bluffs
with
aaron
farr
and
brother
rolf
and
as
they
jumped
off
from
the
bluff
the
snake
bit
him
the
others
having
jumped
over
him
farther
he
said
that
in
two
minutes
after
he
was
bitten
his
tongue
began
to
prick
and
feel
numb
when
he
got
to
camp
his
tongue
and
hands
pricked
and
felt
numb
as
a
person
feels
their
feet
sometimes
when
they
are
said
to
be
asleep
the
brethren
immediately
applied
some
tobacco
juice
and
leaves
also
turpentine
and
bound
tobacco
on
his
leg
which
was
considerably
swollen
we
laid
hands
on
him
and
luke
johnson
administered
a
dose
of
lobelia
in
number
six
after
he
had
taken
a
strong
drink
of
alcohol
and
water
the
lobelia
soon
vomitted
him
powerfully
he
complains
much
of
sickness
at
his
stomach
and
dimness
in
his
eyes
he
appears
to
be
in
much
pain
while
the
brethren
of
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
were
on
one
of
the
high
detached
bluffs
they
found
the
skeleton
of
a
buffalo
head
brother
woodruff
wrote
the
names
of
all
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
present
and
set
it
upon
the
southwest
corner
of
the
bluff
john
brown
also
wrote
his
name
on
it
elder
pratt
took
the
altitude
of
the
bluff
and
found
it
to
be
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
river
he
did
not
calculate
the
height
above
the
sea
owing
to
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
he
however
predicted
wind
from
the
same
cause
at
twelve
the
camp
was
called
together
for
meeting
and
after
singing
and
praying
we
were
addressed
by
elder
snow
followed
by
president
young
the
latter
said
there
were
many
items
of
doctrine
which
he
often
felt
like
teaching
to
the
brethren
but
as
to
administering
sealing
ordinances
this
is
no
time
or
place
for
them
they
belong
to
the
house
of
god
and
when
we
get
located
we
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
build
a
house
etc
he
expressed
himself
satisfied
with
the
conduct
of
the
camp
in
general
he
is
pleased
to
see
so
much
union
and
disposition
to
obey
council
among
the
brethren
and
hoped
and
prayed
that
it
may
continue
and
increase
he
wants
the
brethren
to
seek
after
knowledge
and
be
faithful
to
acknowledge
god
in
all
things
but
never
take
his
name
in
vain
nor
use
profane
language
if
all
the
knowledge
in
this
camp
were
put
together
and
brother
joseph
were
here
in
our
midst
he
could
comprehend
the
whole
of
it
and
wind
it
around
his
little
finger
and
then
think
of
the
knowledge
of
angels
and
above
that
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
there
is
much
for
us
to
learn
and
a
faithful
man
who
desires
eternal
glory
will
seek
after
knowledge
all
the
time
and
his
ideas
never
suffered
to
rust
but
are
always
bright
he
will
not
throw
away
the
knowledge
of
small
things
because
they
are
familiar
but
grasp
all
he
can
and
keep
doing
so
and
by
retaining
many
small
things
he
will
thus
gain
a
large
pile
etc
he
expressed
his
feelings
warmly
towards
all
the
brethren
and
prayed
them
to
be
faithful
diligent
and
upright
for
we
are
now
sowing
seed
the
fruit
of
which
will
be
plucked
in
after
days
whether
good
or
bad
smith
made
a
few
remarks
also
several
others
of
the
brethren
the
president
then
stated
that
on
sunday
next
he
wants
the
brethren
to
understand
that
there
will
be
meeting
at
eleven
and
the
sacrament
administered
and
he
wants
the
brethren
to
attend
all
that
can
and
not
ramble
off
and
fatigue
themselves
but
use
the
sabbath
as
a
day
of
rest
he
enjoined
it
upon
bishops
lewis
roundy
higbee
and
everett
to
see
that
the
proper
necessities
were
prepared
for
the
sacrament
the
meeting
was
then
dismissed
a
while
after
meeting
i
walked
out
with
elder
kimball
a
piece
from
the
camp
we
sat
down
and
i
read
to
him
my
journal
of
the
last
four
days
with
which
he
seemed
well
pleased
we
then
knelt
down
together
and
poured
out
our
souls
to
god
for
ourselves
the
camp
and
our
dear
families
in
winter
quarters
while
we
were
engaged
in
prayer
the
wind
rose
suddenly
from
the
northwest
a
heavy
cloud
having
been
gathering
from
the
west
all
the
afternoon
a
sudden
gust
struck
elder
hat
and
carried
it
off
after
we
got
through
his
hat
was
nowhere
in
sight
but
following
the
direction
of
the
wind
we
soon
saw
it
at
a
distance
on
the
bottom
of
the
prairie
still
flying
swiftly
we
both
ran
and
chased
it
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
and
caught
it
a
little
from
the
river
while
we
were
out
together
i
remarked
that
the
buffalo
gnat
had
bitten
us
very
severely
elder
kimball
said
they
bit
him
very
badly
last
evening
their
bite
is
very
poisonous
and
although
they
are
extremely
small
they
punish
a
person
very
much
with
an
itching
aching
pain
like
a
mosquito
bite
about
five
the
wind
blew
a
perfect
gale
and
continued
till
seven
when
it
commenced
to
rain
very
heavily
large
drops
descending
accompanied
with
hail
which
however
did
not
continue
very
long
but
the
wind
continued
nearly
all
night
the
lightning
and
thunder
continued
some
time
but
not
very
severe
we
saw
the
necessity
of
having
good
stout
bows
to
our
wagons
and
the
covers
well
fastened
down
for
the
very
stoutest
seemed
in
danger
of
being
torn
to
pieces
and
the
wagons
blown
over
when
the
wind
commenced
blowing
so
strongly
it
turned
very
cold
and
long
before
dark
i
went
to
bed
to
keep
warm
brother
fairbanks
seems
considerably
better
this
evening
president
young
kimball
and
benson
laid
hands
on
him
and
he
seemed
much
better
afterwards
monday
may
the
morning
very
cold
indeed
strong
wind
from
northwest
at
we
continued
our
journey
and
traveled
over
level
prairie
ten
miles
then
halted
to
feed
at
the
bluffs
on
the
north
about
two
miles
from
us
and
the
river
one
mile
about
noon
the
weather
began
to
moderate
and
grow
warmer
while
we
were
resting
two
indians
came
to
camp
their
object
evidently
being
to
get
the
dog
which
has
followed
us
to
this
place
they
tarried
a
little
while
and
then
went
away
taking
the
dog
with
them
at
we
again
proceeded
and
traveled
till
distance
six
and
a
half
miles
during
the
day
several
of
the
horse
teams
gave
out
and
they
are
evidently
failing
but
the
oxen
are
gaining
daily
the
mules
stand
the
journey
well
and
in
fact
all
the
teams
considering
the
scarcity
of
grass
about
we
discovered
a
party
of
indians
on
the
opposite
side
the
river
moving
west
when
we
formed
our
encampment
they
crossed
over
the
river
some
of
the
brethren
went
to
meet
them
carrying
a
white
flag
with
them
when
the
indians
saw
the
flag
some
of
them
began
to
sing
and
their
chief
held
up
a
flag
it
was
soon
ascertained
that
their
object
was
to
obtain
something
to
eat
a
number
of
them
came
to
the
camp
and
were
conducted
around
by
colonels
markham
and
rockwood
they
were
shown
a
six
and
fifteen
shooter
also
the
cannon
and
the
gunners
went
through
the
evolutions
a
number
of
times
which
seemed
to
please
them
much
they
are
all
well
dressed
and
very
noble
looking
some
having
good
clean
blankets
others
nice
robes
artfully
ornamented
with
beads
and
paintings
all
had
many
ornaments
on
their
clothing
and
ears
some
had
nice
painted
shells
suspended
from
the
ear
all
appeared
to
be
well
armed
with
muskets
their
moccasins
were
indeed
clean
and
beautiful
one
had
a
pair
of
moccasins
of
a
clear
white
ornamented
with
beads
etc
they
fit
very
tight
to
the
foot
for
cleanness
and
neatness
they
will
vie
with
the
most
tasteful
whites
they
are
in
number
about
half
squaws
and
children
they
are
sioux
and
have
two
recommends
certifying
as
to
their
friendship
etc
the
brethren
contributed
something
to
eat
which
was
sent
to
them
our
course
today
has
been
nearly
west
with
a
cool
wind
the
evening
fine
but
cold
enough
to
freeze
clothing
stiff
when
laid
on
the
grass
to
dry
elder
kimball
has
been
quite
unwell
all
day
and
mostly
kept
to
his
wagon
opposite
the
camp
on
the
south
side
the
river
is
a
very
large
rock
very
much
resembling
a
castle
of
four
stories
high
but
in
a
state
of
ruin
a
little
to
the
east
a
rock
stands
which
looks
like
a
fragment
of
a
very
thick
wall
a
few
miles
to
the
west
chimney
rock
appears
in
full
view
the
scenery
around
is
pleasant
and
romantic
after
the
indians
had
viewed
the
camp
they
returned
to
their
horses
and
the
rest
of
the
party
who
have
camped
on
the
banks
of
the
river
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
west
of
us
elder
sherwood
returned
with
them
and
soon
after
came
back
accompanied
by
the
chief
and
his
squaw
who
signified
a
wish
to
abide
with
our
camp
tonight
the
brethren
fixed
up
a
tent
for
them
to
sleep
under
porter
rockwell
made
them
some
coffee
and
they
were
furnished
with
some
victuals
the
old
chief
amused
himself
very
much
by
looking
at
the
moon
through
a
telescope
for
as
much
as
twenty
minutes
brother
fairbanks
is
much
better
this
evening
last
night
luke
johnson
discovered
a
very
large
petrified
bone
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
bluffs
as
much
as
two
feet
wide
but
he
could
not
ascertain
the
length
of
it
after
laboring
sometime
ineffectually
to
dig
it
up
he
broke
off
two
pieces
and
brought
them
to
camp
they
are
very
white
and
hard
it
is
now
eleven
i
have
been
writing
in
elder
kimball
journal
since
dark
and
have
but
little
chance
to
write
as
much
as
i
want
in
my
own
and
his
both
but
i
feel
determined
to
do
all
i
can
to
keep
a
journal
of
this
expedition
which
will
be
interesting
to
my
children
in
after
days
and
perhaps
to
many
of
the
saints
the
evening
is
very
fine
but
cool
and
i
retire
to
rest
with
the
feeling

and
very
pleasant
most
of
the
indians
men
women
and
children
came
early
to
camp
on
their
ponies
and
marched
around
mostly
trying
to
obtain
something
to
eat
several
little
barters
were
made
with
them
for
moccasins
skins
etc
john
higbee
traded
ponies
with
one
of

they
have
some
good
ponies
and
some
inferior
ones
but
both
male
and
females
are
neatly
dressed
and
very
tidy
they
look
cheerful
and
pleased
to
witness
the
camp
etc
at
we
proceeded
onward
after
we
started
the
indians
left
us
and
went
over
the
river
one
mile
from
where
we
started
we
began
to
ascend
a
low
range
of
bluffs
to
avoid
a
large
high
sandy
ridge
which
projects
to
the
river
we
traveled
three
quarters
of
a
mile
and
descended
again
to
the
level
prairie
at
we
halted
to
let
the
cattle
and
teams
graze
the
feed
being
good
and
plentiful
having
traveled
two
and
a
half
miles
mostly
northwest
around
a
bend
of
the
river
the
sun
is
very
hot
the
roads
sandy
and
hard
teaming
the
river
is
probably
three
quarters
of
a
mile
wide
here
and
on
this
side
there
are
many
small
islands
at
continued
our
journey
and
traveled
till
half
past
one
distance
four
and
three
quarters
miles
over
a
very
soft
wet
level
prairie
we
then
halted
to
feed
and
rest
our
teams
as
they
have
been
hard
drawn
nearly
all
day
we
have
seen
no
game
for
several
days
except
a
few
antelope
and
hares
the
buffalo
appear
to
have
left
this
region
and
in
fact
there
are
little
signs
of
many
having
been
here
the
feed
is
poor
mostly
last
year
growth
and
very
short
one
of
the
hunters
killed
an
antelope
which
was
brought
to
camp
and
divided
to
the
captains
of
tens
at
we
started
again
and
traveled
till
a
quarter
to
six
distance
four
and
three
quarters
miles
and
during
the
day
twelve
miles
for
three
miles
of
the
first
of
this
afternoon
we
had
a
good
road
but
the
last
part
has
been
very
wet
and
soft
numerous
ponds
of
water
standing
all
around
caused
by
heavy
rains
we
have
camped
on
a
very
wet
spot
but
the
feed
being
poor
where
it
was
drier
it
was
decided
to
stay
for
the
benefit
of
the
teams
our
course
has
been
about
northwest
very
little
wind
and
the
day
very
warm
chimney
rock
shows
very
plain
and
appears
not
more
than
two
miles
distance
but
is
no
doubt
five
miles
distance
or
over

antelope
has
been
killed
and
brought

yesterday
morning
stephen
markham
traded
a
mule
which
was
foundered
and
unable
to
work
to
one
of
the
indians
for
a
pony
they
put
him
in
the
harness
a
little
towards
evening
and
again
this
morning
when
crossing
a
very
soft
place
the
whipple
tree
unhitched
and
struck
against
his
heels
he
ran
full
gallop
towards
the
head
teams
and
twice
through
the
line
of
wagons
causing
several
teams
horses
and
oxen
both
to
spring
from
the
road
and
run
some
distance
before
the
men
could
stop
them
after
running
nearly
a
mile
some
of
the
brethren
caught
the
pony
brought
him
back
and
put
him
to
the
wagon
again
without
any
accident
except
a
little
injury
to
the
harness
after
traveling
four
and
miles
we
arrived
at
a
point
directly
north
of
chimney
rock
which
we
ascertained
by
the
compass
having
traveled
since
it
was
first
discovered
miles
we
proceeded
till
twelve
and
halted
to
feed
having
traveled
seven
and
a
quarter
miles
a
northwest
course
the
road
very
straight
and
hard
excepting
a
few
spots
where
the
water
stands
caused
by
late
heavy
rains
we
turned
south
a
little
to
get
to
grass
as
the
higher
prairie
is
barren
and
scarcely
any
grass
on
it
porter
rockwell
has
killed
two
antelope
and
john
brown
one
which
were
brought
into
camp
and
are
being
divided
amongst
the
companies
as
usual
elder
pratt
found
that
chimney
rock
is
feet
high
from
its
base
to
its
summit
and
the
distance
from
our
road
at
the
nearest
point
three
miles
the
latitude
at
noon
halt
at
resumed
our
journey
making
our
road
nearer
the
river
than
this
morning
the
road
somewhat
crooked
but
good
traveling
after
traveling
five
miles
turned
directly
south
to
avoid
a
bad
slough
and
went
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
then
formed
our
encampment
at
five
on
the
banks
of
the
river
the
last
quarter
of
a
mile
was
not
reckoned
in
the
day
travel
which
exclusive
of
that
is
miles
course
north
of
northwest
the
feed
here
is
good
and
sufficient
to
fill
our
teams
well
joseph
hancock
killed
an
antelope
which
was
brought
into
camp
and
distributed
soon
after
we
camped
walked
out
to
the
bank
of
the
river
with
presidents
young
and
kimball
to
read
to
them
some
of
the
minutes
of
the
old
council
we
were
joined
by
richards
and
tarried
till
seven
at
which
time
a
heavy
black
cloud
was
fast
approaching
from
the
west
and
was
soon
followed
by
a
strong
wind
and
a
little
rain
which
lasted
only
a
short
time
the
evening
afterwards
warm
and
pleasant
though
somewhat
cloudy
carloss
murray
has
been
trying
to
rear
the
young
eagle
caught
on
saturday
after
stopping
tonight
he
put
it
under
a
wagon
and
a
while
afterwards
the
men
ran
the
wagon
back
one
of
the
wheels
ran
over
its
head
and
killed
it
i
wrote
in
heber
journal
till
half
past
ten
and
then
went
to
rest
thursday
may
the
morning
very
fine
we
have
seen
a
number
of
romantic
spots
on
our
journey
but
i
consider
our
view
this
morning
more
sublime
than
any
other
chimney
rock
lies
southeast
opposite
detached
bluffs
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
to
the
southwest
scott
bluffs
look
majestic
and
sublime
the
prairie
over
which
our
route
lies
is
very
level
and
green
as
far
as
we
can
see
the
bluffs
on
the
north
low
and
about
three
miles
distant
the
scenery
is
truly
delightful
beyond
imagination
i
have
finished
making
richards
map
to
chimney
rock
elder
pratt
has
measured
the
width
of
the
river
at
this
place
by
the
sextant
and
found
it
to
be
exactly
yards
at
ten
minutes
to
eight
we
continued
our
journey
and
traveled
near
the
banks
of
the
river
till
being
eight
miles
the
route
very
good
hard
and
good
traveling
although
a
little
crooked
porter
rockwell
has
killed
two
antelope
and
amasa
lyman
one
which
were
brought
to
the
wagons
and
distributed
there
are
some
heavy
thunder
clouds
in
the
south
and
west
and
a
nice
breeze
from
northeast
at
two
we
continued
our
journey
over
the
same
kind
of
dry
level
prairie
keeping
not
far
distant
from
the
banks
of
the
river
and
making
a
straight
road
at
the
distance
of
four
and
an
eighth
miles
passed
the
meridian
of
the
northernmost
peak
of
bluffs
being
miles
from
the
meridian
of
chimney
rock
these
bluffs
are
very
high
steep
and
broken
like
many
others
resembling
ancient
ruins
they
are
probably
two
miles
from
north
to
south
extremity
but
not
very
wide
we
traveled
till
and
formed
our
encampment
in
a
circle
near
the
banks
of
the
river
which
from
this
place
seems
to
bend
for
some
distance
to
the
north
having
traveled
this
afternoon
five
and
three
quarters
miles
and
during
the
day
thirteen
and
three
quarters
mostly
northwest
elders
kimball
and
woodruff
pointed
out
the
road
this
forenoon
afternoon
elder
kimball
rode
with
me
in
johnson
wagon
while
i
read
some
of
his
journal
to
him
the
evening
is
very
cold
wind
northeast
and
raining
some
feed
is
good
and
the
camp
generally
well
another
antelope
was
brought
in
by
the
hunters
the
latitude
of
the
northernmost
peak
of
scott
bluffs
friday
may
the
morning
cool
damp
cloudy
and
some
rain
wind
northeast
at
about
eight
the
brethren
were
called
together
and
the
question
asked
shall
we
go
on
in
the
rain
or
wait
until
it
is
fair
all
agreed
to
stay
until
it
was
fair
i
went
to
writing
in
heber
journal
and
wrote
till
nearly
eleven
elder
kimball
came
to
the
next
wagon
where
some
of
the
boys
were
playing
cards
he
told
them
his
views
and
disapprobation
of
their
spending
time
gaming
and
dancing
and
mock
trying
and
especially
the
profane
language
frequently
uttered
by
some
he
reasoned
with
them
on
the
subject
and
showed
them
that
it
would
lead
from
bad
to
worse
if
persisted
in
until
the
consequences
would
become
serious
he
exhorted
them
to
be
more
sober
and
wise
it
growing
fair
we
started
out
at
eleven
our
first
four
miles
being
north
of
northwest
in
consequence
of
a
bend
in
the
river
we
traveled
beside
a
creek
of
very
clear
water
about
a
mile
it
rises
about
four
miles
northwest
of
where
we
camped
last
night
and
runs
in
a
crooked
direction
till
it
empties
into
the
river
about
a
mile
west
of
the
camp
it
rises
from
springs
as
was
proved
by
horace
whitney
who
traced
it
to
its
source
where
there
is
a
spring
rising
out
of
a
circular
kind
of
wet
swamp
about
six
feet
in
diameter
the
creek
is
about
eight
feet
wide
but
not
deep
the
bottom
is
gravelly
near
where
it
empties
into
the
river
they
discovered
a
number
of
large
spotted
trout
suckers
and
dais
of
a
good
size
the
water
tasted
very
good
and
cold
at
the
distance
of
four
miles
we
arrived
and
traveled
at
the
foot
of
the
bluffs
the
road
sandy
and
heavy
on
teams
we
soon
turned
from
the
bluffs
on
a
level
barren
prairie
hard
and
good
traveling
at
nine
miles
descended
on
a
lower
bench
of
prairie
where
we
found
it
wet
and
soft
though
not
bad
rolling
at
formed
our
encampment
near
the
river
having
traveled
eleven
and
a
half
miles
the
last
seven
a
little
south
of
west
the
feed
here
is
not
very
good
driftwood
tolerably
plentiful
we
have
seen
a
few
small
trees
on
the
islands
today
but
none
on
the
north
bank
vast
quantities
of
southern
wood
and
prickley
pear
grow
on
these
sandy
prairies
where
there
is
no
grass
the
evening
cloudy
and
dull
with
cold
northeast
wind
while
thomas
brown
and
porter
rockwell
were
out
hunting
about
five
miles
north
of
here
the
former
saw
five
or
six
indians
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
him
they
also
saw
many
new
footprints
of
horses
which
shows
that
there
is
a
hunting
party
near
saturday
may
the
morning
cold
wet
and
cloudy
with
wind
from
northeast
we
shall
not
travel
unless
it
grows
fair
and
better
weather
i
spent
the
morning
writing
in
elder
kimball
journal
but
felt
very
unwell
having
taken
cold
yesterday
and
been
sick
all
night
about
ten
the
weather
looked
a
little
better
and
at
half
past
ten
the
bugle
sounded
as
a
signal
for
the
teams
to
be
got
together
after
the
teams
were
harnessed
the
brethren
were
called
together
to
the
boat
in
the
circle
president
young
taking
his
station
in
the
boat
ordered
each
captain
of
ten
to
lead
out
his
respective
company
and
get
all
his
men
together
he
then
called
on
the
clerk
to
call
over
the
names
of
the
camp
to
see
if
all
were
present
joseph
hancock
and
andrew
gibbons
were
reported
to
be
absent
hunting
brothers
elijah
newman
and
nathaniel
fairbanks
were
confined
to
their
wagons
but
answered
to
their
names
the
remainder
all
present
president
young
then
addressed
the
meeting
in
substance
as
follows
i
remarked
last
sunday
that
i
had
not
felt
much
like
preaching
to
the
brethren
on
this
mission
this
morning
i
feel
like
preaching
a
little
and
shall
take
for
my
text
as
to
pursuing
our
journey
with
this
company
with
the
spirit
they
possess
i
am
about
to
revolt
against
it
this
is
the
text
i
feel
like
preaching
on
this
morning
consequently
i
am
in
no
hurry
in
the
first
place
before
we
left
winter
quarters
it
was
told
to
the
brethren
and
many
knew
it
by
experience
that
we
had
to
leave
our
homes
our
houses
our
land
and
our
all
because
we
believed
in
the
gospel
as
revealed
to
the
saints
in
these
last
days
the
rise
of
the
persecutions
against
the
church
was
in
consequence
of
the
doctrines
of
eternal
truth
taught
by
joseph
many
knew
this
by
experience
some
lost
their
husbands
some
lost
their
wives
and
some
their
children
through
persecution
and
yet
we
have
not
been
disposed
to
forsake
the
truth
and
turn
and
mingle
with
the
gentiles
except
a
few
who
have
turned
aside
and
gone
away
from
us
and
we
have
learned
in
a
measure
the
difference
between
a
professor
of
religion
and
a
possessor
of
religion
before
we
left
winter
quarters
it
was
told
to
the
brethren
that
we
were
going
to
look
out
a
home
for
the
saints
where
they
would
be
free
from
persecution
by
the
gentiles
where
we
could
dwell
in
peace
and
serve
god
according
to
the
holy
priesthood
where
we
could
build
up
the
kingdom
so
that
the
nations
would
begin
to
flock
to
our
standard
i
have
said
many
things
to
the
brethren
about
the
strictness
of
their
walk
and
conduct
when
we
left
the
gentiles
and
told
them
that
we
would
have
to
walk
upright
or
the
law
would
be
put
in
force
etc
many
have
left
and
turned
aside
through
fear
but
no
good
upright
honest
man
will
fear
the
gospel
does
not
bind
a
good
man
down
and
deprive
him
of
his
rights
and
privileges
it
does
not
prevent
him
from
enjoying
the
fruits
of
his
labors
it
does
not
rob
him
of
blessings
it
does
not
stop
his
increase
it
does
not
diminish
his
kingdom
but
it
is
calculated
to
enlarge
his
kingdom
as
well
as
to
enlarge
his
heart
it
is
calculated
to
give
him
privileges
and
power
and
honor
and
exaltation
and
everything
which
his
heart
can
desire
in
righteousness
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
then
when
he
gets
exalted
into
the
eternal
world
he
can
still
turn
around
and
say
it
hath
not
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
to
conceive
the
glory
and
honor
and
blessings
which
god
hath
in
store
for
those
that
love
and
serve
him
i
want
the
brethren
to
understand
and
comprehend
the
principles
of
eternal
life
and
to
watch
the
spirit
be
wide
awake
and
not
be
overcome
by
the
adversary
you
can
see
the
fruits
of
the
spirit
but
you
can
not
see
the
spirit
itself
with
the
natural
eye
you
behold
it
not
you
can
see
the
result
of
yielding
to
the
evil
spirit
and
what
it
will
lead
you
to
but
you
do
not
see
the
spirit
itself
nor
its
operations
only
by
the
spirit
that
in
you
nobody
has
told
me
what
has
been
going
on
in
the
camp
but
i
have
known
it
all
the
while
i
have
been
watching
its
movements
its
influence
its
effects
and
i
know
the
result
if
it
is
not
put
a
stop
to
i
want
you
to
understand
that
inasmuch
as
we
are
beyond
the
power
of
the
gentiles
where
the
devil
has
tabernacles
in
the
priests
and
the
people
we
are
beyond
their
reach
we
are
beyond
their
power
we
are
beyond
their
grasp
and
what
has
the
devil
now
to
work
upon
upon
the
spirits
of
men
in
this
camp
and
if
you
do
not
open
your
hearts
so
that
the
spirit
of
god
can
enter
your
hearts
and
teach
you
the
right
way
i
know
that
you
are
a
ruined
people
and
will
be
destroyed
and
that
without
remedy
and
unless
there
is
a
change
and
a
different
course
of
conduct
a
different
spirit
to
what
is
now
in
this
camp
i
go
no
farther
i
am
in
no
hurry
give
me
the
man
of
prayers
give
me
the
man
of
faith
give
me
the
man
of
meditation
a
man
and
i
would
far
rather
go
amongst
the
savages
with
six
or
eight
such
men
than
to
trust
myself
with
the
whole
of
this
camp
with
the
spirit
they
now
possess
here
is
an
opportunity
for
every
man
to
prove
himself
to
know
whether
he
will
pray
and
remember
his
god
without
being
asked
to
do
it
every
day
to
know
whether
he
will
have
confidence
enough
to
ask
of
god
that
he
may
receive
without
my
telling
him
to
do
it
if
this
camp
was
composed
of
men
who
had
newly
received
the
gospel
men
who
had
not
received
the
priesthood
men
who
had
not
been
through
the
ordinances
in
the
temple
and
who
had
not
had
years
of
experience
enough
to
have
learned
the
influence
of
the
spirits
and
the
difference
between
a
good
and
an
evil
spirit
i
should
feel
like
preaching
to
them
and
watching
over
them
and
telling
them
all
the
time
day
by
day
but
here
are
the
elders
of
israel
men
who
have
had
years
of
experience
men
who
have
had
the
priesthood
for
years
and
have
they
got
faith
enough
to
rise
up
and
stop
a
mean
low
groveling
covetous
quarrelsome
spirit
no
they
have
not
nor
would
they
try
to
stop
it
unless
i
rise
up
in
the
power
of
god
and
put
it
down
i
do
not
mean
to
bow
down
to
the
spirit
that
is
in
this
camp
and
which
is
rankling
in
the
bosoms
of
the
brethren
and
which
will
lead
to
knock
downs
and
perhaps
to
the
use
of
the
knife
to
cut
each
other
throats
if
it
is
not
put
a
stop
to
i
do
not
mean
to
bow
down
to
the
spirit
which
causes
the
brethren
to
quarrel
when
i
wake
up
in
the
morning
the
first
thing
i
hear
is
some
of
the
brethren
jawing
each
other
and
quarreling
because
a
horse
has
got
loose
in
the
night
i
have
let
the
brethren
dance
and
fiddle
and
act
the
nigger
night
after
night
to
see
what
they
will
do
and
what
extremes
they
would
go
to
if
suffered
to
go
as
far
as
they
would
i
do
not
love
to
see
it
the
brethren
say
they
want
a
little
exercise
to
pass
away
time
in
the
evenings
but
if
you
ca
tire
yourselves
bad
enough
with
a
day
journey
without
dancing
every
night
carry
your
guns
on
your
shoulders
and
walk
carry
your
wood
to
camp
instead
of
lounging
and
lying
asleep
in
your
wagons
increasing
the
load
until
your
teams
are
tired
to
death
and
ready
to
drop
to
the
earth
help
your
teams
over
mud
holes
and
bad
places
instead
of
lounging
in
your
wagons
and
that
will
give
you
exercise
enough
without
dancing
well
they
will
play
cards
they
will
play
checkers
they
will
play
dominoes
and
if
they
had
the
privilege
and
were
where
they
could
get
whiskey
they
would
be
drunk
half
their
time
and
in
one
week
they
would
quarrel
get
to
high
words
and
draw
their
knives
to
kill
each
other
this
is
what
such
a
course
of
things
would
lead
to
do
you
know
it
yes
well
then
why
do
you
try
to
put
it
down
i
have
played
cards
once
in
my
life
since
i
became
a
mormon
to
see
what
kind
of
spirit
would
attend
it
and
i
was
so
well
satisfied
that
i
would
rather
see
in
your
hands
the
dirtiest
thing
you
could
find
on
the
earth
than
a
pack
of
cards
you
never
read
of
gambling
playing
cards
checkers
dominoes
in
the
scriptures
but
you
do
read
of
men
praising
the
lord
in
the
dance
but
who
ever
read
of
praising
the
lord
in
a
game
at
cards
if
any
man
had
sense
enough
to
play
a
game
at
cards
or
dance
a
little
without
wanting
to
keep
it
up
all
the
time
but
exercise
a
little
and
then
quit
it
and
think
no
more
of
it
it
would
do
well
enough
but
you
want
to
keep
it
up
till
midnight
and
every
night
and
all
the
time
you
know
how
to
control
your
senses
last
winter
when
we
had
our
seasons
of
recreation
in
the
council
house
i
went
forth
in
the
dance
frequently
but
did
my
mind
run
on
it
no
to
be
sure
when
i
was
dancing
my
mind
was
on
the
dance
but
the
moment
i
stopped
in
the
middle
or
the
end
of
a
tune
my
mind
was
engaged
in
prayer
and
praise
to
my
heavenly
father
and
whatever
i
engage
in
my
mind
is
on
it
while
engaged
in
it
but
the
moment
i
am
done
with
it
my
mind
is
drawn
up
to
my
god
the
devils
which
inhabit
the
gentiles
priests
are
here
the
tabernacles
are
not
here
we
are
out
of
their
power
we
are
beyond
their
grasp
we
are
beyond
the
reach
of
their
persecutions
but
the
devils
are
here
and
the
first
thing
you
know
if
you
do
open
your
eyes
and
your
hearts
they
will
cause
divisions
in
our
camp
and
perhaps
war
as
they
did
with
the
lamanites
as
you
read
in
the
book
of
mormon
do
we
suppose
that
we
are
going
to
look
out
a
home
for
the
saints
a
resting
place
a
place
of
peace
where
they
can
build
up
the
kingdom
and
bid
the
nations
welcome
with
a
low
mean
dirty
trifling
covetous
wicked
spirit
dwelling
in
our
bosoms
it
is
vain
vain
some
of
you
are
very
fond
of
passing
jokes
and
will
carry
your
jokes
very
far
but
will
you
take
a
joke
if
you
do
not
want
to
take
a
joke
do
give
a
joke
to
your
brethren
joking
nonsense
profane
language
trifling
conversation
and
loud
laughter
do
not
belong
to
us
suppose
the
angels
were
witnessing
the
hoe
down
the
other
evening
and
listening
to
the
haw
haws
the
other
evening
would
they
not
be
ashamed
of
it
i
am
ashamed
of
it
i
have
not
given
a
joke
to
any
man
on
this
journey
nor
felt
like
it
neither
have
i
insulted
any
man
feelings
but
i
have
hollowed
pretty
loud
and
spoken
sharply
to
the
brethren
when
i
have
seen
their
awkwardness
at
coming
to
camp
the
revelations
in
the
bible
in
the
book
of
mormon
and
doctrine
and
covenants
teach
us
to
be
sober
and
let
me
ask
you
elders
that
have
been
through
the
ordinances
in
the
temple
what
were
your
covenants
there
i
say
you
should
remember
them
when
i
laugh
i
see
my
folly
and
nothingness
and
weakness
and
am
ashamed
of
myself
i
think
meaner
and
worse
of
myself
than
any
man
can
think
of
me
but
i
delight
in
god
and
in
his
commandments
and
delight
to
meditate
on
him
and
to
serve
him
and
i
mean
that
everything
in
me
shall
be
subjected
to
him
now
let
every
man
repent
of
his
weakness
of
his
follies
of
his
meanness
and
every
kind
of
wickedness
and
stop
your
swearing
and
profane
language
for
it
is
in
this
camp
and
i
know
it
and
have
known
it
i
have
said
nothing
about
it
but
i
now
tell
you
if
you
do
stop
it
you
shall
be
cursed
by
the
almighty
and
shall
dwindle
away
and
be
damned
such
things
shall
not
be
suffered
in
this
camp
you
shall
honor
god
and
confess
his
name
or
else
you
shall
suffer
the
penalty
most
of
this
camp
belong
to
the
church
nearly
all
and
i
would
say
to
you
brethren
and
to
the
elders
of
israel
if
you
are
faithful
you
will
yet
be
sent
to
preach
this
gospel
to
the
nations
of
the
earth
and
bid
all
welcome
whether
they
believe
the
gospel
or
not
and
this
kingdom
will
reign
over
many
who
do
not
belong
to
the
church
over
thousands
who
do
not
believe
in
the
gospel
bye
and
bye
every
knee
shall
bow
and
every
tongue
confess
and
acknowledge
and
reverence
and
honor
the
name
of
god
and
his
priesthood
and
observe
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
whether
they
belong
to
the
church
and
obey
the
gospel
or
not
and
i
mean
that
every
man
in
this
camp
shall
do
it
that
is
what
the
scripture
means
by
every
knee
shall
bow
and
you
can
not
make
anything
else
out
of
it
i
understand
there
are
several
in
this
camp
who
do
not
belong
to
the
church
i
am
the
man
who
will
stand
up
for
them
and
protect
them
in
all
their
rights
and
they
shall
not
trample
on
our
rights
nor
on
the
priesthood
they
shall
reverence
and
acknowledge
the
name
of
god
and
his
priesthood
and
if
they
set
up
their
heads
and
seek
to
introduce
iniquity
into
this
camp
and
to
trample
on
the
priesthood
i
swear
to
them
they
shall
never
go
back
to
tell
the
tale
i
will
leave
them
where
they
will
be
safe
if
they
want
to
retreat
they
can
now
have
the
privilege
and
any
man
who
chooses
to
go
back
rather
than
abide
the
law
of
god
can
now
have
the
privilege
of
doing
so
before
we
go
any
farther
here
are
the
elders
of
israel
who
have
the
priesthood
who
have
got
to
preach
the
gospel
who
have
to
gather
the
nations
of
the
earth
who
have
to
build
up
the
kingdom
so
that
the
nations
can
come
to
it
they
will
stop
to
dance
as
niggers
i
do
mean
this
as
debasing
the
negroes
by
any
means
they
will
hoe
down
all
turn
summersets
dance
on
their
knees
and
haw
haw
out
loud
they
will
play
cards
they
will
play
checkers
and
dominoes
they
will
use
profane
language
they
will
swear
suppose
when
you
go
to
preach
the
people
should
ask
you
what
you
did
when
you
went
on
this
mission
to
seek
out
a
home
for
the
whole
church
what
was
your
course
of
conduct
did
you
dance
yes
did
you
hoe
down
all
yes
did
you
play
cards
yes
did
you
play
checkers
yes
did
you
use
profane
language
yes
did
you
swear
yes
did
you
quarrel
with
each
other
and
threaten
each
other
why
yes
how
would
you
feel
what
would
you
say
for
yourselves
would
you
not
want
to
go
and
hide
up
your
mouths
would
be
stopped
and
you
would
want
to
creep
away
in
disgrace
i
am
one
of
the
last
to
ask
my
brethren
to
enter
into
solemn
covenants
but
if
they
will
not
enter
into
a
covenant
to
put
away
their
iniquity
and
turn
to
the
lord
and
serve
him
and
acknowledge
and
honor
his
name
i
want
them
to
take
their
wagons
and
retreat
back
for
i
shall
go
no
farther
under
such
a
state
of
things
if
we
do
repent
and
quit
our
wickedness
we
will
have
more
hinderances
than
we
have
had
and
worse
storms
to
encounter
i
want
the
brethren
to
be
ready
for
meeting
tomorrow
at
the
time
appointed
instead
of
rambling
off
and
hiding
in
their
wagons
to
play
cards
etc
i
think
it
will
be
good
for
us
to
have
a
fast
meeting
tomorrow
and
a
prayer
meeting
to
humble
ourselves
and
turn
to
the
lord
and
he
will
forgive
us
he
then
called
upon
all
the
high
priests
to
step
forth
in
a
line
in
front
of
the
wagon
and
then
the
bishops
to
step
in
front
of
the
high
priests
which
being
done
he
counted
them
and
found
their
number
to
be
four
bishops
and
fifteen
high
priests
he
then
called
upon
all
the
seventies
to
form
a
line
in
the
rear
of
the
high
priests
on
being
counted
they
were
ascertained
to
number
next
he
called
on
the
elders
to
form
a
line
in
the
rear
of
the
wagon
they
were
eight
in
number
there
were
also
eight
of
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
he
then
asked
the
brethren
of
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
if
they
were
willing
to
covenant
to
turn
to
the
lord
with
all
their
hearts
to
repent
of
all
their
follies
to
cease
from
all
their
evils
and
serve
god
according
to
his
laws
if
they
were
willing
to
manifest
it
by
holding
up
their
right
hand
every
man
held
up
his
hand
in
token
that
he
covenanted
he
then
put
the
same
question
to
the
high
priests
and
bishops
next
to
the
seventies
and
then
to
the
elders
and
lastly
to
the
other
brethren
all
covenanted
with
uplifted
hands
without
a
dissenting
voice
he
then
addressed
those
who
are
not
members
of
the
church
and
told
them
they
should
be
protected
in
their
rights
and
privileges
while
they
would
conduct
themselves
well
and
not
seek
to
trample
on
the
priesthood
nor
blaspheme
the
name
of
god
etc
he
then
referred
to
the
conduct
of
benjamin
rolfe
two
younger
brothers
in
joining
with
the
higbees
and
john
bennett
in
sowing
discord
and
strife
among
the
saints
in
nauvoo
and
remarked
that
there
will
be
no
more
bennett
scrapes
suffered
here
he
spoke
highly
of
benjamin
rolfe
conduct
although
not
a
member
of
the
church
and
also
referred
to
the
esteem
in
which
his
father
and
mother
were
held
by
the
saints
generally
he
then
very
tenderly
blessed
the
brethren
and
prayed
that
god
would
enable
them
to
fulfill
their
covenants
and
then
withdrew
to
give
opportunity
for
others
to
speak
if
they
felt
like
it
elder
kimball
arose
to
say
that
he
agreed
with
all
that
president
young
had
said
he
receives
it
as
the
word
of
the
lord
to
him
and
it
is
the
word
of
the
lord
to
this
camp
if
they
will
receive
it
he
has
been
watching
the
motion
of
things
and
the
conduct
of
the
brethren
for
some
time
and
has
seen
what
it
would
lead
to
he
has
said
little
but
thought
a
great
deal
it
has
made
him
shudder
when
he
has
seen
the
elders
of
israel
descend
to
the
lowest
dirtiest
things
imaginable
the
tail
end
of
everything
but
what
has
passed
this
morning
will
make
it
an
everlasting
blessing
to
the
brethren
if
they
will
repent
and
be
faithful
and
keep
their
covenant
he
never
can
rest
satisfied
until
his
family
is
liberated
from
the
gentiles
and
their
company
and
established
in
a
land
where
they
can
plant
and
reap
the
fruits
of
their
labors
but
he
has
never
had
the
privilege
of
eating
the
fruits
of
his
labors
yet
neither
has
his
family
but
when
this
is
done
he
can
sleep
in
peace
if
necessary
but
not
till
then
if
we
will
serve
the
lord
remember
his
name
to
call
upon
him
and
be
faithful
we
shall
not
one
of
us
be
left
under
the
sod
but
shall
be
permitted
to
return
and
meet
our
families
in
peace
and
enjoy
their
society
again
but
if
this
camp
continues
the
course
of
conduct
it
has
done
the
judgment
of
god
will
overtake
us
he
hopes
the
brethren
will
take
heed
to
what
president
young
has
said
and
let
it
sink
deep
in
their
hearts
elder
pratt
wanted
to
add
a
word
to
what
has
been
said
much
good
advice
has
been
given
to
teach
us
how
we
may
spend
our
time
profitably
by
prayer
and
meditation
etc
but
there
is
another
idea
which
he
wants
to
add
there
are
many
books
in
the
camp
and
worlds
of
knowledge
before
us
which
we
have
not
obtained
and
if
the
brethren
would
devote
all
their
leisure
time
to
seeking
after
knowledge
they
would
never
need
to
say
they
had
nothing
with
which
to
pass
away
their
time
if
we
could
spend
hours
out
of
the
in
gaining
knowledge
and
only
sleep
one
hour
of
the
all
the
days
of
our
life
there
would
still
be
worlds
of
knowledge
in
store
for
us
yet
to
learn
he
knows
it
is
difficult
to
bring
our
minds
to
diligent
and
constant
studies
in
pursuit
of
knowledge
all
at
once
but
by
steady
practice
and
perseverance
we
shall
become
habituated
to
it
and
it
will
become
a
pleasure
to
us
he
would
recommend
to
the
brethren
besides
prayer
and
obedience
to
seek
after
knowledge
continually
and
it
will
help
us
to
overcome
our
follies
and
nonsense
we
shall
have
no
time
for
it
elder
woodruff
said
he
remembered
the
time
when
the
camp
went
up
to
missouri
to
redeem
zion
when
brother
joseph
stood
up
on
a
wagon
wheel
and
told
the
brethren
that
the
decree
had
passed
and
could
not
be
revoked
and
the
destroying
angel
would
visit
the
camp
and
we
should
die
like
sheep
with
the
rot
he
had
repeatedly
warned
the
brethren
of
their
evil
conduct
and
what
it
would
lead
to
but
they
still
continued
in
their
course
it
was
not
long
before
the
destroying
angel
did
visit
the
camp
and
the
brethren
began
to
fall
as
brother
joseph
had
said
we
buried
eighteen
in
a
short
time
and
a
more
sorrowful
time
i
never
saw
there
are
nine
here
who
were
in
that
camp
and
they
all
recollect
the
circumstance
well
and
will
never
forget
it
he
has
been
thinking
while
the
president
was
speaking
that
if
he
was
one
who
had
played
checkers
or
cards
he
would
take
every
pack
of
cards
and
every
checker
board
and
burn
them
up
so
that
they
would
no
longer
be
in
the
way
to
tempt
us
colonel
markham
acknowledged
that
he
had
done
wrong
in
many
things
he
had
always
indulged
himself
before
he
came
into
the
church
with
everything
he
desired
and
he
knows
he
has
done
wrong
on
this
journey
he
knows
his
mind
has
become
darkened
since
he
left
winter
quarters
he
hopes
the
brethren
will
forgive
him
and
he
will
pray
to
be
forgiven
and
try
to
do
better
while
he
was
speaking
he
was
very
much
affected
indeed
and
wept
like
a
child
many
of
the
brethren
felt
much
affected
and
all
seemed
to
realize
for
the
first
time
the
excess
to
which
they
had
yielded
and
the
awful
consequence
of
such
things
if
persisted
in
many
were
in
tears
and
felt
humbled
president
young
returned
to
the
boat
as
brother
markham
closed
his
remarks
and
said
in
reply
that
he
knew
the
brethren
would
forgive
him
and
the
lord
will
forgive
us
all
if
we
turn
to
him
with
all
our
hearts
and
cease
to
do
evil
the
meeting
was
then
dismissed
each
man
retiring
to
his
wagon
and
being
half
past
one
we
again
pursued
our
journey
in
peace
all
reflecting
on
what
has
passed
today
and
many
expressing
their
gratitude
for
what
has
transpired
it
seemed
as
though
we
were
just
commencing
on
this
important
mission
and
all
realizing
the
responsibility
resting
upon
us
to
conduct
ourselves
in
such
a
manner
that
the
journey
may
be
an
everlasting
blessing
to
us
instead
of
an
everlasting
disgrace
no
loud
laughter
was
heard
no
swearing
no
quarreling
no
profane
language
no
hard
speeches
to
man
or
beast
and
it
truly
seemed
as
though
the
cloud
had
burst
and
we
had
emerged
into
a
new
element
a
new
atmosphere
and
a
new
society
we
traveled
six
and
three
quarters
miles
about
a
north
of
northwest
course
and
then
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
low
bluffs
which
extend
within
about
ten
rods
of
the
river
the
latter
forming
a
large
bend
northward
at
this
point
at
the
foot
of
the
bluffs
the
road
was
sandy
and
very
heavy
on
our
teams
like
all
other
sandy
places
it
was
perfectly
barren
being
only
a
tuft
of
grass
here
and
there
after
passing
over
the
sand
we
changed
our
course
to
a
little
north
of
west
not
however
leaving
the
bluffs
very
far
the
river
bends
again
to
the
south
we
then
found
the
ground
hard
and
good
to
travel
over
but
perfectly
bare
of
grass
for
upwards
of
a
mile
at
five
it
commenced
raining
very
hard
accompanied
by
lightning
and
thunder
and
strong
northeast
wind
it
also
changed
considerably
cooler
again
at
five
thirty
we
formed
our
encampment
on
the
edge
of
the
higher
bench
of
prairie
the
feed
is
tolerably
good
on
the
bottom
but
here
there
is
none
at
all
we
have
passed
a
small
grove
of
fair
sized
trees
all
green
growing
on
the
islands
in
the
river
which
are
tolerably
many
near
here
but
there
is
no
timber
yet
on
this
side
of
the
river
the
brethren
pick
up
drift
wood
enough
to
do
their
cooking
i
spent
the
evening
writing
in
this
journal
till
half
past
twelve
but
felt
quite
unwell
the
distance
we
have
traveled
today
is
eight
and
a
half
miles
during
the
week
and
a
half
making
us
miles
from
winter
quarters
there
is
a
creek
of
clear
water
about
yards
to
the
south
from
which
the
camp
obtains
what
they
want
sunday
may
the
morning
fair
and
somewhat
more
pleasant
although
there
is
yet
appearance
for
more
rain
i
felt
quite
unwell
through
the
night
and
also
this
morning
having
severe
pain
at
nine
most
of
the
brethren
retired
a
little
south
of
the
camp
and
had
a
prayer
meeting
and
as
many
as
chose
to
expressed
their
feelings
at
a
little
before
twelve
they
met
again
in
the
same
spot
to
partake
of
the
sacrament
soon
afterwards
all
the
members
of
the
council
of
the
of
in
the
camp
except
brother
thomas
bullock
went
onto
the
bluffs
and
selecting
a
small
circular
level
spot
surrounded
by
bluffs
and
out
of
sight
we
clothed
ourselves
in
the
priestly
garments
and
offered
up
prayer
to
god
for
ourselves
this
camp
and
all
pertaining
to
it
the
brethren
in
the
army
our
families
and
all
the
saints
president
young
being
mouth
we
all
felt
well
and
glad
for
this
privilege

and

the
two
latter
having
no
clothing
with
them
stood
guard
at
a
little
distance
from
us
to
prevent
interruption
when
we
started
for
the
bluffs
there
was
a
heavy
black
thunder
cloud
rising
from
the
southwest
and
from
all
appearance
it
might
rain
any
minute
but
the
brethren
believed
it
would
not
rain
till
we
got
through
and
if
it
did
we
chose
rather
to
take
a
wetting
than
to
be
disappointed
of
the
privilege
it
kept
off
remarkably
till
we
got
through
and
got
our
clothing
on
but
soon
after
it
began
to
rain
and
after
we
got
to
camp
it
rained
considerably
accompanied
by
strong
wind
i
never
noticed
the
brethren
so
still
and
sober
on
a
sunday
since
we
started
as
today
there
is
no
jesting
nor
laughing
nor
nonsense
all
appear
to
be
sober
and
feel
to
remember
their
covenant
which
makes
things
look
far
more
pleasant
than
they
have
done
heretofore
i
spent
most
of
the
afternoon
in
elder
kimball
wagon
with
elder
kimball
president
young
lorenzo
and
phineas
young
read
the
minutes
of
president
young
discourse
of
yesterday
about
five
president
young
kimball
benson
and
others
walked
out
together
to
the
bluffs
they
invited
me
to
go
with
them
but
i
was
so
afflicted
with
cramps
i
could
scarcely
walk
and
after
drinking
a
cup
of
tea
prepared
by
ellen
sanders
i
went
to
my
wagon
and
retired
to
bed
early
the
evening
more
pleasant
with
a
light
shower
occasionally
elder
kimball
president
young
and
others
saw
the
black
hills
in
the
distance
from
a
high
bluff
monday
may
the
morning
fine
but
cool
i
feel
quite
unwell
yet
and
have
been
sick
all
night
at
a
quarter
past
eight
we
proceeded
onward
found
good
level
traveling
the
day
cool
and
pleasant
we
soon
struck
a
wagon
trail
which
evidently
leads
direct
to
fort
laramie
at
four
miles
passed
some
high
sandy
bluffs
traveled
till
after
twelve
and
then
turned
off
a
little
to
the
southwest
and
at
half
past
twelve
halted
for
noon
at
the
edge
of
lower
land
where
there
is
some
short
green
grass
for
our
teams
the
land
we
have
traveled
over
this
morning
is
naked
and
barren
course
west
of
northwest
distance
nine
and
a
half
miles
a
high
wind
from
northwest
latitude
started
again
at
weather
warm
and
wind
ceased
at
formed
our
encampment
on
the
east
bank
of
a
shoal
stream
about
ten
feet
wide
having
traveled
this
afternoon
seven
and
a
quarter
miles
and
during
the
day
sixteen
and
three
quarters
our
course
this
afternoon
a
little
north
of
west
about
four
miles
back
passed
some
timber
on
this
side
of
the
river
which
is
the
first
since
the
inst
being
a
distance
of
miles
without
wood
for
fire
except
driftwood
and
much
of
the
time
nothing
but
buffalo
chips
the
last
four
or
five
miles
have
been
sandy
the
ground
uneven
and
very
heavy
on
our
teams
the
country
looks
perfectly
barren
in
some
places
there
is
nothing
but
a
few
weeds
and
garlick
some
of
the
brethren
picked
considerable
of
the
latter
to
eat
the
feed
is
very
poor
indeed
but
a
little
better
than
four
miles
back
john
higbee
has
killed
a
deer
and
some
of
the
brethren
wounded
two
others
this
deer
which
brother
higbee
killed
is
of
the
long
tailed
species
having
a
tail
more
than
a
half
a
yard
long
and
is
the
first
one
i
ever
saw
of
the
kind
a
while
after
we
camped
president
young
and
kimball
went
to
the
bluffs
and
again
saw
the
black
hills
in
the
distance
they
bowed
before
the
lord
and
offered
up
their
prayers
together
the
month
of
may
has
passed
over
and
we
have
been
permitted
to
proceed
so
far
on
our
journey
being
miles
from
our
families
in
winter
quarters
with
the
camp
generally
enjoying
good
health
and
good
spirits
and
although
some
things
have
passed
which
have
merited
chastisement
we
have
the
privilege
at
the
closing
of
the
month
of
seeing
a
better
feeling
a
more
noble
spirit
and
a
more
general
desire
to
do
right
than
we
have
before
witnessed
i
feel
to
humble
myself
and
give
god
thanks
for
his
continued
mercies
to
me
and
my
brethren
and
may
his
spirit
fill
our
hearts
and
may
his
angels
administer
comfort
health
peace
and
prosperity
to
all
our
families
and
all
the
saints
henceforth
and
forever
amen
june
tuesday
june
the
morning
very
fine
warm
and
pleasant
all
is
still
and
quiet
as
a
summer
morning
the
camp
well
and
in
good
spirits
and
a
feeling
of
peace
union
and
brotherly
love
seems
to
dwell
in
every
breast
my
mind
revolves
back
upon
days
and
then
to
the
present
and
i
truly
feel
thankful
to
my
god
for
his
mercies
to
me
and
for
the
privilege
i
now
daily
enjoy
the
idea
of
dwelling
with
my
family
in
a
land
of
peace
in
the
midst
of
the
saints
of
god
is
better
felt
than
described
but
the
mild
still
scenery
of
this
morning
puts
me
in
mind
of
it
at
nine
we
pursued
our
journey
the
stream
we
passed
over
is
called
by
grosclaude
the
raw
hide
elder
kimball
let
me
have
his
horse
to
ride

went
in

was
on
foot
carrying
his
gun
in
fulfillment
of
president
young
prophecy
at
the
pawnee
mission
station
the
wagons
went
on
till
half
past
eleven
and
then
halted
for
noon
we
were
about
a
mile
ahead
of
them
the
distance
they
traveled
was
four
and
a
half
miles
at
half
past

out
again
and
traveled
till
a
little
after
four
and
saw
fort

about
four
miles
to
the
southwest
elder
kimball
and
president
young
then
came
up
to
where
brother
woodruff
and
i
were
looking
out
for
feed
and
we
started
on
president
young
having
stopped
the
wagons
and
went
to
the
ford
opposite
to
the
fort
it
was
finally
concluded
to
form
our
encampment
here
on
the
banks
of
the
river
several
men
soon
came
down
from
the
fort
which
is
about
two
miles
from
here
and
made
themselves
known
as
a
part
of
the
mississippi
company
from
pueblo
they
have
been
here
two
weeks
it
caused
us
much
joy
to
meet
with
brethren
in
this
wild
region
of
country
and
also
because
we
should
have
some
news
from
the
brethren
in
the
army
luke
johnson
being
up
here
with
the
boat
and
several
others
coming
up

got
the

into
the
river
to
go
over
and
see
the
brethren
and
luke
johnson
john
brown
joseph
mathews
and
porter
rockwell
started
over
and
about
the
same
time
presidents
young
and
kimball
started
back
to
bring
the
camp
up
when
the
brethren
got
over
the
river
brother
brown
met
several
whom
he
knew
and
soon
returned
bringing
brother

and
his
over
to
this
side
the

seemed
pleased
to

the
pueblo
brethren
are
expected
to
receive
their
pay
and
start
for
this
point
at
latest
by
this
date
and
will
probably
be
here
in
about
two
weeks
they
also
recorded
that
three
traders
from
the
mountains
arrived
here
six
days
ago
having
come
from
sweet
water
in
six
days
and
nights
they
traveled
day
and
night
with
horses
and
mules
to
prevent
their
starving
to
death
as
there
is
no
feed
up
there
two
of
their
oxen
had
died
already
etc
the
snow
was
two
feet
deep
at
sweet
water
when
they
left
so
that
we
are
evidently
plenty
soon
enough
for
feed
at
the
wagons
arrived
and
formed
encampment
on
the
banks
of
the
river
in
the
form
of
a
v
having
traveled
this
afternoon
seven
and
a
half
miles
and
during
the
day
twelve
making
a
total
from
winter
quarters
to
fort
laramie
miles
and
we
have
traveled
it
in
seven
weeks
lacking
a
half
a
day
but
we
have
traveled
but
a
few
miles
on
sundays
we
have
arrived
so
far
on
our
journey
without
accident
except
the
loss
of
two
horses
by
indians
and
two
killed
we
have
been
prosperous
on
our
journey
the
camp
are
all
in
better
health
than
when
we
left
winter
quarters
and
we
see
daily
that
the
lord
blesses
us
and
directs
the
movements
of
this
camp
as
seemeth
him
good
and
as
is
for
our
good
and
prosperity
the
road
today
has
been
mostly
sandy
and
heavy
on
teams
with
but
little
feed
in
any
place
the
country
begins
to
have
a
more
hilly
and
mountainous
appearance
some
of
the
black
hills
show
very
plain
from
here
the
timber
is
mostly
ash
and
cottonwood
on
the
low
bottoms
near
the
river
there
is
some
cedar
on
the
bluffs
in
one
of
the
large
ash
trees
in
the
middle
of
the
camp
is
an
indian
babe
or
papoose
it
can
not
be
said
to
be
buried
but
deposited
being
first
wrapped
with
a
skin
and
then
tied
between
two
of
the
highest
limbs
of
the
tree
this
is
said
to
be
the
way
they
bury
their
dead
the
bark
is
all
peeled
off
the
tree
below
i
suppose
to
prevent
the
wolves
from
getting
up
wednesday
june
the
morning
pleasant
about
nine
started
over
the
river
in
company
with
the
twelve
and
others
to
view
the
fort
and
also
learn
something
in
regard
to
our
journey
etc
elder
pratt
measured
the
distance
across
the
river
at
this
spot
and
found
it
to
be
yards
the
water
is
deep
in
the
channel
and
the
current
runs
about
four
miles
an
hour
after
crossing
we
went
up
to
the
remains
of
an
old
fort
called
fort
platte
which
is
near
the
banks
of
the
river
the
outside
walls
still
standing
but
the
inside
is
in
ruins
having
been
burned
up
the
walls
are
built
of
adobes
or
spanish
brick
being
large
pieces
of
tempered
clay
dried
in
the
sun
and
apparently
laid
one
on
another
without
mortar
or
cement
the
dimensions
of
this
fort
outside
are
feet
east
to
west
and
from
north
to
south
feet
there
is
a
large
door
fronting
to
the
south
which
has
led
to
the
dwellings
which
have
been
fourteen
in
number
built
in
the
form
of
a
parallelogram
leaving
a
large
space
in
the
center
the
space
occupied
by
the
dwelling
is
not
quite
half
of
the
whole
fort
fronting
to
the
east
is
another
large
door
which
opens
upon
a
large
open
space
feet
by
feet
where
it
is
supposed
they
used
to
keep
horses
etc
at
the
northwest
corner
is
a
tower
projecting
out
from
the
line
of
the
walls
six
feet
each
way
or
in
other
words
it
is
twelve
feet
square
with
port
holes
for
cannon
at
the
northeast
corner
has
been
another
projection
extending
eastward
feet
and
is
feet
wide
the
walls
are
feet
high
and
inches
thick
we
took
the
dimensions
of
this
with
a
tape
line
and
then
proceeded
to
fort
laramie
about
two
miles
farther
west
this
latter
fort
was
first
built
of
wood
about
thirteen
years
since
and
named
fort
william
but
being
destroyed
was
afterwards
built
seven
years
ago
with
adobes
and
named
john
it
stands
on
the
bank
of
the
laramie
fork
laramie
fork
is
a
stream
yards
wide
a
very
swift
current
but
not
deep
we
tarried
a
little
while
with
the
mississippi
brethren
who
have
camped
close
by
the
fort
and
then
went
inside
we
were
politely
welcomed
by
bordeau
who
appears
to
be
the
principal
officer
he
conducted
us
up
a
flight
of
stairs
into
a
comfortable
room
and
being
furnished
with
seats
we
rested
ourselves
president
young
and
others
entered
into
conversation
with
bordeau
from
him
we
learned
that
we
can
not
travel
over
four
miles
farther
on
the
north
side
the
platte
before
we
come
to
bluffs
which
can
not
be
crossed
with
loaded
wagons
the
road
is
better
on
this
side
than
the
one
we
have
traveled
it
being
hard
and
not
sandy
feed
scarce
mostly
lying
in
little
patches
near
the
river
they
send
their
furs
to
fort
pierre
on
the
missouri
river
a
distance
of
miles
by
land
and
receive
all
their
stores
and
provisions
back
by
the
same
teams
except
their
meat
which
they
kill
there
being
buffalo
within
two
days
drive
they
have
tried
making
a
garden
and
planting
corn
which
did
well
enough
the
first
year
but
afterwards
they
could
raise
nothing
for
want
of
rain
they
have
had
no
rain
for
two
years
until
a
few
days
ago
they
have
got
a
flat
boat
which
will
carry
two
wagons
easily
which
we
can
have
for
fifteen
dollars
or
he
will
ferry
us
over
for
or
a
wagon
from
the
door
of
this
room
one
can
see
the
same
black
hill
seen
on
sunday
evening
and
which
is
laramie
peak
we
could
see
the
snow
lying
on
it
very
plainly
we
can
also
see
several
ranges
of
high
hills
in
the
distance
which
are
no
doubt
parts
of
the
black
hills
we
went
across
the
square
to
the
trading
house
which
lies
on
the
north
side
of
the
western
entrance
the
trader
opened
his
store
and
president
young
entered
into
conversation
with
him
they
trade
solely
with
the
sioux
the
crows
come
here
for
nothing
but
to
steal
a
few
weeks
ago
a
party
came
down
and
stole
horses
all
that
they
had
at
the
fort
although
they
were
within
yards
of
the
fort
at
the
time
and
a
guard
around
them
the
sioux
will
not

found
it
yards

also
took
the
latitude
which
was
brother
bullock
told
me
that
several
of
the
brethren
had
picked
up
a
number
of
beads
off
the
ant
hills
curiosity
led
me
to
go
and
examine
and
i
found
it
even
so
it
appears
that
the
ants
gather
all
the
small
pebbles
they
can
carry
and
build
them
over
their
hills
to
prevent
the
strong
winds
from
blowing
them
away
and
amongst
the
rest
they
picked
up
beads
which
have
been
lost
off
the
indians
moccasins
and
robes
etc
i
picked
up
quite
a
number
brother
bullock
and
i
took
the
dimensions
of
the
fort
which
will
be
given
in
another
place
we
then
got
on
board
the
boat
and
had
a
pleasant
ride
about
three
miles
down
the
laramie
fork
to
its
mouth
the
current
being
very
swift
at
the
mouth
the
brethren
mostly
got
on
shore
and
towed
the
boat
up
to
camp
after
dinner
i
went
over
again
in
the
cutter
which
was
going
to
fish
with
the
seine
in
the
laramie
fork
they
caught
sixty
or
seventy
small
fish
salmon
suckers
etc
about
six
we
returned
to

longitude
at
fort
laramie

size
shape
and
color

fact
i
know
of
no
difference
between
the
two
we
passed
a
number
of
currant
bushes
about
four
miles
back
quite
thick
with
young
green
currants
on
the
morning
of

thursday
june
the
morning
cold
with
strong
southeast
wind
the
first
division
commenced
ferrying
over
the
river
at
five
and
took
a
wagon
over
every
fifteen
minutes
after
breakfast
i
went
over
and
wrote
a
letter
for
elder
kimball
to
james
brown
at
pueblo
then
walked
up
to
a
high
bluff
on
the
northwest
to
view
the
country
but
not
being
able
to
see
far
from
it
i
went
to
another
over
a
mile
farther
northwest
although
this
last
was
very
high
i
could
see
nothing
but
a
succession
of
high
ranges
of
bluffs
as
far
as
i
could
see
except
the
narrow
space
through
which
the
river
winds
its
course
seeing
some
heavy
thunder
clouds
rising
very
rapidly
from
the
northwest
i
returned
to
camp
and
arrived
just
before
the
rain
commenced
elders
lyman
thomas
woolsey
john
tippets
and
roswell
stevens
started
at
on
horses
and
mules
for
pueblo
president
young
kimball
richards
and
pratt
accompanied
them
to
the
laramie
fork
and
then
held
a
council
kneeled
down
and
dedicated
them
to
god
and
blessed
them
the
four
then
forded
the
river
and
went
on
their
journey
the
others
returned
to
camp
at
half
past
it
commenced
raining
heavily
accompanied
by
hail
lightning
and
very
loud
thunder
which
lasted
till
during
the
storm
the
horses
were
mostly
secured
in
the
old
fort
the
ferrying
ceased
till
it
was
fair
again
and
about
five
the
first
division
were
all
over
the
boat
was
then
manned
by
the
second
division
john
higbee
captain
they
averaged
a
wagon
across
in
eleven
minutes
and
one
in
ten
minutes
and
one
in
ten
minutes
and
twenty
seconds
the
quickest
trip
made
by
the
first
division
was
thirteen
minutes
about
seven
it
commenced
raining
again
from
the
southeast
and
rained
heavily
consequently
the
brethren
quit
ferrying
leaving
three
companies
of
about
fifteen
wagons
on
the
other
side
all
the
wagons
would
have
been
taken
over
today
if
it
had
not
been
stormy
there
is
a
report
come
in
that
there
are
wagons
on
the
road
to
oregon
but
a
little
distance
behind
but
we
are
satisfied
the
report
is
exaggerated
there
are
eighteen
wagons
camped
about
three
miles
below
and
one
of
the
men
who
has
come
to
the
fort
says
that
they
have
counted
over
wagons
they
have
lost
four
horses
by
the
indians
friday
june
morning
very
fine
laramie
peak
shows
very
plain
the
brethren
commenced
ferrying
at
and
at
eight
the
last
wagon
was
over
i
walked
up
to
a
high
bluff
with
carlos
murray
and
picked
up
some
stalactites
clear
as
crystal
supposed
to
be
isinglass
the
bluff
is
very
high
and
almost
perpendicular
and
it
is
dangerous
to
get
to
the
crystals
at
nine
president
young
kimball
richards
rockwood
and
bullock
walked
up
to
fort
laramie
and
returned
soon
after
eleven
they
have
learned
very
favorable
reports
about
bear
river
valley
being
well
timbered
plenty
of
good
grass
light
winters
little
snow
and
abundance
of

with
the
second
division
and
at
twelve
we
started
on
our
journey
again
following
the
oregon
road
we
traveled
three
miles
and
at
minutes
past
halted
near
some
good
grass
to
let
our
teams
feed
the
weather
is
very
warm
though
many
light
clouds
are
flying
the
bluffs
come
near
the
river
and
are
very
high
steep
and
look
like
sand
during
the
halt
i
went
up
on
a
very
high
bluff
near
by
with
my
glass
i
found
it
very
difficult
of
ascent
from
the
top
i
could
see
laramie
peak
very
plainly
and
also
some
hills
a
long
way
off
to
the
northwest
the
country
looks
very
hilly
as
far
as
can
be
seen
and
the
snow
on
the
peak
shows
quite
plain
at
half
past
two
we
continued
our
journey
and
found
the
road
sandy
and
very
uneven
at
the
distance
of
seven
and
three
quarters
miles
from
fort
laramie
we
descended
a
very
steep
pitch
or
hill
all
the
wagons
had
to
be
locked
and
we
were
some
time
getting
down

went
on
half
a
mile
farther

formed
our

a
circle

half
past
five

traveled
eight
and
a
quarter

elder
kimball
gave
george
billings
a
lecture
about
abusing
his
team
kicking
them
etc
he
gave
george
some
very
good
advice
the
horn
sounded
early
to
start
but
we
were
detained
till
half
past
eight
on
account
of
several
oxen
being
missing
about
that
time
they
were
found
and
we
pursued
our
journey
after
traveling
a
little
over
four
miles
we
ascended
a
steep
bluff
the
road
runs
on
the
top
of
it
a
little
distance
in
a
very
crooked
direction
the
surface
in
some
places
being
hard
uneven
rock
which
shakes
and
jars
the
wagons
very
much
in
one
place
there
is
a
little
descent
and
at
the
bottom
a
very
sharp
turn
in
the
road
over
rough
rock
here
brother
crow
cart
turned
over
however
it
was
soon
righted
and
no
injury
done
to
anything
at
the
west
foot
is
a
steep
sandy
descent
but
not
difficult
the
bluff
is
a
half
a
mile
across
about
a
half
a
mile
from
the
west
foot
we
turned
from
the
river
nearly
a
west
course
and
crossed
a
low
gravelly
channel
where
it
appears
the
river
has
run
sometime
and
perhaps
does
now
in
high
water
the
road
after
this
is
considerably
crooked
and
uneven
about
a
mile
and
a
quarter
farther
we
descended
again
on
the
same
gravelly
channel
and
traveled
up
it
a
piece
and
at
halted
for
noon
opposite
a
very
large
spring
noticed
by
fremont
the
water
of
this
spring
is
very
clear
and
soft
but
considerably
warmer
than
the
river
water
we
have
traveled
this
morning
six
and
a
half
miles
just
as
we
halted
two
men
came
down
from
the
other
road
on
mules
to
water
they
are
in
company
with
eleven
wagons
and
bound
for
west
of
the
mountains
they
say
the
other
road
from
laramie
is
only
ten
miles
to
the
spring
while
our
road
has
been
miles
about
a
half
an
hour
after
we
stopped
we
had
a
nice
shower
the
division
halted
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
back
from
here
latitude
at
the
warm
springs
while
we
were
halting
the
company
above
referred
to
passed
down
the
bluffs
and
went
ahead
of
us
they
have
got
many
cows
with
them
at
we
resumed
our
journey
after
traveling
a
mile
we
turned
in
a
narrow
pass
to
the
northwest
between
two
high
bluffs
and
traveled
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
then
came
to
where
the
road
rises
a
very
high
steep
bluff
at
the
foot
is
a
short
sudden
pitch
and
then
a
rugged
ascent
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
bluff
is
rocky
and
many
large
cobble
stones
lay
in
the
road
which
made
it
hard
on
teams
appleton
harmon
took
one
of
his
yoke
of
cattle
and
assisted
george
billings
to
the
top
and
brother
johnson
took
appleton
steers
and
put
them
forward
of
his
and
brought
up
his
wagon
appleton
and
johnson
then
took
the
three
yoke
of
oxen
and
fetched
up
appleton
wagon
which
threw
us
nearly
in
the
rear
of
all
the
wagons
none
of
the
rest
doubling
teams
after
arriving
on
the
top
the
road
was
good
but
still
rising
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
we
traveled
on
this
high
land
five
and
a
quarter
miles
which
was
very
good
traveling
although
it
was
considerably
rolling
four
and
a
half
miles
from
the
top
of
the
last
mentioned
bluff
we
passed
a
large
lone
rock
standing
far
away
from
any
other
at
five
and
a
quarter
miles
we
descended
again
from
the
bluff
the
descent
being
steep
and
lengthy
but
sandy
and
good
to
travel
at
the
foot
of
the
bluff
we
again
crossed
the
gravelly
channel
and
traveled
on
and
alongside
about
a
mile
then
descended
a
little
to
the
bottom
prairie
again
at
we
formed
our
encampment
on
the
west
bank
of
a
small
stream
and
near
a
very
good
spring
of
cold
water
having
traveled
this
afternoon
miles
and
during
the
day
seventeen
i
have
put
up
two
guide
boards
today
one
at
and
the
other
at
miles
from
fort
john
or
laramie
but
the
former
name
is
on
the
guide
boards
the
bluffs
we
have
passed
today
are
mostly
very
high
rocky
and
broken
with
pine
growing
on
most
or
nearly
all
of
them
we
have
pretty
good
feed
here
and
plenty
of
wood
and
good
water
the
gentile
camp
is
a
little
east
of
us
they
say
that
there
were
two
more
companies
arrived
at
fort
laramie
this
morning
as
they
left
and
three
other
companies
within
twenty
miles
of
laramie
they
left
this
morning
they
left
independence
on
the
of
april
they
are
expecting
the
mail
soon
on
mules
but
they
anticipate
keeping
ahead
of
all
the
companies
we
find
the
road
very
crooked
but
not
bad
traveling
about
dark
it
rained
some
accompanied
by
lightning
and
thunder
the
camp
was
notified
that
tomorrow
will
be
a
day
for
fasting
and
prayer
as
last
sunday
sunday
june
morning
cloudy
cool
and
like
for
rain
at
eight
the
eleven
wagons
passed
us
again
at
nine
the
brethren
assembled
for
prayer
meeting
a
little
from
the
camp
but
many
kept
about
their
wagons
some
washing
and
some
at
other
things
at
eleven
four
missourians
came
up
mounted
being
part
of
a
company
a
little
behind
some
of
these
are
recognized
by
the
brethren
and
they
seem
a
little
afraid
and
not
fond
of
our
company
they
say
the
old
settlers
have
all
fled
from
shariton
missouri
except
two
tavern
keepers
and
i
feel
to
wish
that
their
fears
may
follow
them
even
to
oregon
at
half
past
eleven
just
as
the
brethren
again
assembled
for
meeting
it
commenced
raining
hard
accompanied
by
lightning
and
heavy
thunder
which
caused
the
meeting
to
break
up
abruptly
during
the
storm
the
missouri
company
passed
by
us
having
nineteen
wagons
and
two
carriages
most
of
their
wagons
have
five
yoke
of
cattle
to
each
and
few
less
than
four
they
have
many
cows
horses
and
young
cattle
with
them
they
have
a
guide
with
them
who
lives
on
the
mary
river
at
the
columbia
he
says
we
shall
find
water
again
about
six
miles
from
here
and
then
no
more
for
fifteen
miles
farther
it
was
then
considered
wise
to
move
on
this
afternoon
as
we
can
not
well
reach
the
second
watering
place
in
one
day
soon
after
twelve
the
weather
cleared
off
the
sun
shone
and
looks
like
for
being
fine
the
wind
blows
strong
from
the
west
at
half
past
the
camp
began
to
move
forward
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
we
crossed
the
same
small
stream
again
and
two
miles
further
arrived
at
a
sudden
bend
in
the
road
to
the
south
about
two
hundred
yards
and
then
as
sudden
to
the
north
the
same
distance
occasioned
by
the
water
having
washed
a
deep
gulf
where
the
road
ought
to
run
a
mile
beyond
this
the
wagons
came
to
a
halt
in
a
body
of
timber
and
brushwood
at
four
and
halted
while
the
brethren
on
horseback
viz
elder
young
kimball
and
woodruff
went
ahead
to
look
for
a
camping
ground
they
returned
at
and
the
camp
proceeded
on
having
proceeded
a
quarter
of
a
mile
we
passed
the
camp
of
the
nineteen
wagons
close
by
the
timber
a
little
south
of
the
road
several
of
the
men
came
to
look
at
the
roadometer
having
heard
from
some
of
the
brethren
that
we
had
one
they
expressed
a
wish
to
each
other
to
see
inside
and
looked
upon
it
as
a
curiosity
i
paid
no
attention
to
them
inasmuch
as
they
did
not
address
themselves
to
me
at
a
quarter
past
we
formed
our
encampment
in
an
oblong
circle
at
the
foot
of
a
low
bluff
on
the
west
and
close
by
water
having
traveled
five
miles
the
feed
here
is
very
good
and
plentiful
wind
strong
from
the
west
road
very
crooked
mostly
a
southwest
and
west
course
there
is
plenty
of
timber
all
along
and
the
soil
looks
good
on
the
low
lands
one
of
the
men
in
the
company
of
the
nineteen
wagons
told
smith
that
he
had
broken
his
carriage
spring
and
seemed
much
troubled
to
know
what
to
do
to
get
along
he
asked
george
if
there
was
any
man
in
our
company
who
could
fix
it
george
told
him
there
was
after
we
were
camped
burr
frost
set
up
his
forge
and
welded
the
spring
ready
to
put
on
before
dark
monday
june
morning
fine
elder
pratt
gave
me
some
instructions
on
the
use
of
the
sextant
and
showed
me
how
to
take
an
observation
he
has
promised
to
teach
me
to
take
observations
and
calculate
latitude
and
longitude
and
i
intend
to
improve
the
opportunity
at
the
missouri
company
passed
through
again
and
at
ten
minutes
past
seven
we
commenced
our
onward
course
richards
left
a
letter
in
a
guide
board
miles
to
fort
john
i
walked
about
five
miles
mostly
in
company
with
elder
pratt
conversing
on
astronomy
and
philosophical
subjects
elder
kimball
then
let
me
have
his
horse
to
ride
we
traveled
till
eleven
and
then
halted
to
feed
on
the
west
bank
of
a
small
stream
and
spring
of
clear
water
having
traveled
miles
mostly
a
north
of
northwest
course
the
road
more
even
and
good
traveling
soon
after
we
halted
another
company
of
missourians
passed
us
having
thirteen
wagons
and
mostly
four
yoke
of
oxen
to
each
they
say
they
are
from
andrew
county
missouri
at
we
moved
forward
at
a
quarter
of
a
mile
began
to
ascend
a
bluff
which
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
the
ascent
gradual
and
tolerably
steep
from
the
top
of
this
hill
we
had
as
pleasant
a
view
of
the
surrounding
country
as
i
have
ever
witnessed
laramie
peak
appears
only
a
few
miles
to
the
southwest
and
from
that
around
to
the
west
north
and
northeast
a
very
extensive
view
of
a
beautiful
country
for
many
miles
indeed
as
far
as
the
eye
could
survey
from
a
fair
view
of
the
peak
i
am
satisfied
that
the
black
hills
of
which
this
is
a
prominent
part
are
so
named
from
the
vast
forests
of
pine
trees
covering
their
surface
and
being
of
a
dark
green
color
within
a
few
miles
of
them
the
pine
grows
in
the
most
rocky
places
and
abounds
on
the
highest
hills
while
on
the
lower
bluffs
it
is
sparsely
scattered
and
in
the
bottom
land
which
looks
rich
and
good
there
are
none
we
have
passed
many
noble
trees
and
there
is
no
lack
of
good
pine
timber
in
this
region
the
peak
is
very
high
and
very
broken
and
craggy
the
snow
still
lying
on
its
summit
and
plainly
visible
with
the
naked
eye
the
ridge
over
which
we
passed
was
a
half
a
mile
over
from
the
southeast
to
the
northwest
foot
at
that
distance
we
began
to
descend
and
had
to
lock
the
wagons
in
several
places
the
descent
was
rendered
unpleasant
by
the
many
large
cobble
stones
scattered
in
the
road
many
of
the
brethren
threw
them
out
of
the
road
as
we
went
along
and
the
road
is
much
improved
they
have
also
dug
down
some
places
and
leveled
others
which
will
make
the
road
much
better
for
other
companies
at
half
past
three
we
arrived
at
horse
creek
and
formed
our
encampment
on
the
bottom
land
near
the
timber
or
rather
in
the
midst
of
a
grove
of
ash
cottonwood
having
traveled
five
and
a
quarter
miles
this
afternoon
over
crooked
road
and
during
the
day
thirteen
miles
on
this
camp
ground
is
one
of
the
clearest
and
largest
springs
of
water
i
have
seen
for
a
long
time
elder
kimball
having
discovered
it
he
calls
it
his
spring
or
heber
spring
the
creek
is
also
clear
and
said
to
have
trout
in
it
the
feed
is
much
better
and
more
plentiful
than
we
have
ever
met
with
on
this
journey
there
is
abundance
of
wild
mint
and
sage
growing
here
the
mint
seems
to
perfume
the
air
the
sage
grows
in
abundance
on
all
this
sandy
land
there
are
also
many
wild
currant
bushes
in
full
bloom
and
prickley
pears
all
along
the
road
the
other
companies
were
all
within
two
miles
when
we
arrived
here
but
mostly
going
on
a
few
miles
farther
a
little
before
we
stopped
we
had
a
thunder
storm
which
lasted
upwards
of
an
hour
during
the
latter
part
of
it
it
rained
very
heavily
accompanied
by
hail
and
thunder
and
lightning
our
hunters
have
killed
a
deer
and
an
antelope
which
were
distributed
as
usual
brother
crow
hunter
also
killed
a
deer
but
they
are
unwilling
to
conform
to
the
rules
of
the
camp
in
dividing
and
reserve
it
all
to
themselves
brother
crow
observed
that
if
they
got
more
than
they
could
use
they
would
be
willing
to
let
the
camp
have
some
some
of
the
other
companies
killed
an
antelope
took
off
the
quarters
and
left
the
balance
on
the
ground
brother
pack
picked
it
up
and
brought
it
along
after
we
stopped
brother
crow
came
near
meeting
with
an
accident
while
endeavoring
to
yoke
up
a
pair
of
wild
steers
it
took
a
number
of
men
to
hold
them
having
lariats
on
their
they
got
the
lariats
entangled
round
their
legs
and
brother
crow
also
throwing
one
of
the
steers
down
and
he
fast
with
it
they
cut
the
rope
and
he
was
liberated
without
injury
myers
the
hunter
roasts
the
young
antlers
of
the
deer
and
eats
them
in
regard
to
brother
crow
meat
i
afterwards
learned
that
the
whole
family
had
to
depend
on
myers
for
what
they
eat
having
no
bread
stuff
nor
anything
only
what
he
kills
and
the
little
flour
and
meal
paid
to
him
for
a
part
of
the
ferryage
he
having
a
small
claim
on
bordeau
after
supper
walked
out
with
elder
kimball
and
was
joined
by
george
smith
brother
smith
told
me
of
a
good
opportunity
of
sending
a
letter
to
my
family
by
some
traders
who
are
expected
down
every
day
and
i
feel
to
improve
the
opportunity
we
had
a
very
strong
wind
at
night
so
much
that
i
could
not
write
tuesday
june
morning
fine
though
cool
at
half
past
seven
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
crossing
the
horseshoe
creek
which
is
about
a
rod
wide
we
traveled
two
and
a
quarter
miles
winding
around
the
foot
of
high
bluffs
and
then
began
to
ascend
them
we
found
this
ascent
the
worst
we
have
ever
had
being
three
quarters
of
a
mile
up
and
having
in
that
distance
seven
very
steep
rises
on
most
of
them
the
teams
had
to
double
we
saw
a
buffalo
about
a
half
a
mile
to
the
south
which
is
the
first
we
have
seen
since
about
the
of
may
two
and
a
half
miles
from
the
east
foot
of
the
last
bluff
we
passed
over
a
small
creek
nearly
dry
and
then
ascended
another
high
bluff
but
not
nearly
so
bad
a
rise
as
the
other
one
at
we
halted
for
noon
near
a
very
small
creek
with
but
little
water
in
it
having
traveled
six
and
three
quarters
miles
over
hills
and
valleys
the
roads
being
very
crooked
about
half
an
hour
before
we
halted
harriet
crow
got
run
over
with
one
of
their
wagons
the
teams
had
stopped
near
the
descent
from
the
bluffs
and
she
stepped
on
the
wagon
tongue
to
get
a
drink
the
cattle
started
suddenly
threw
her
under
the
wheel
which
passed
over
her
leg
below
the
knee
and
downwards
passing
over
her
foot
above
the
toes
she
screamed
and
appeared
in
great
agony
we
thought
her
leg
was
broken
but
were
soon
satisfied
to
the
contrary
her
foot
was
badly
bruised
but
i
think
there
was
nothing
broken
one
of
the
women
washed
it
with
camphor
she
was
then
put
into
a
wagon
and
we
proceeded
on
latitude
at
we
proceeded
after
traveling
a
little
over
a
mile
and
a
half
we
passed
another
small
creek
and
again
ascended
a
high
bluff
we
found
this
ridge
more
uneven
than
the
other
it
being
a
perfect
succession
of
hills
and
hollows
for
five
miles
the
road
was
good
and
hard
while
traveling
on
the
top
the
wind
blew
very
strong
from
the
west
and
it
was
so
cold
that
we
suffered
some
the
road
over
was
indeed
very
crooked
but
mostly
bending
to
the
north
we
could
see
a
long
distance
from
the
top
the
country
to
the
north
looks
more
even
but
south
and
southwest
very
hilly
and
broken
at
five
miles
we
began
to
descend
gradually
and
while
watching
the
roadometer
i
discovered
it
did
not
work
right
which
made
me
pay
more
attention
to
it
at
ten
minutes
past
six
we
crossed
a
stream
about
thirty
feet
wide
and
nearly
two
feet
deep
with
a
very
swift
current
it
is
named
on
fremont
map
as
la
bonte
river
we
formed
our
encampment
on
the
west
bank
in
the
timber
having
traveled
this
afternoon
miles
and
during
the
day
the
evening
is
very
cold
and
much
appearance
of
rain
porter
rockwell
has
killed
a
deer
and
someone
else
an
antelope
porter
says
he
has
been
on
the
platte
which
is
about
four
miles
from
here
following
the
la
bonte
soon
after
we
stopped
the
men
came
into
camp
who
were
expected
to
carry
a
letter
they
are
camped
about
a
mile
west
of
us
i
finished
my
letter
to
my
family
by
candle
light
as
it
is
contemplated
to
start
in
the
morning
before
breakfast
and
go
a
few
miles
to
better
feed

at
and
at
we
moved
onward
keeping
near
the
la
bonte
at

for
breakfast
beside
the
traders
camp
having
come
a
mile
and
a
quarter
i
sent
my
letter
to
them
by
aaron
farr
a
number
of
the
brethren
also
sending
letters
while
we
halted
i
got
the
roadometer
fixed
again
and
also
put
up
a
guide
board
marked
to
fort
john
miles
these
traders
or
mountaineers
said
they
had
left
a
kind
of
ferry
made
of
three
buffalo
skins
hung
in
a
tree
on
the
platte
and
wanted
brother
crow
company
to
have
it
it
was
decided
to
send
a
company
ahead
to
overreach
the
missouri
companies
and
get
the
ferry
before
they
could
arrive
and
also
build
a
raft
for
us
to
cross
on
kill
game
etc
the
men
say
it
is
about
seventy
miles
to
where
we
cross
the
river
nineteen
wagons
were
sent
ahead
and
about
forty
men
to
attend
to
this
business
all
of
brother
crow
company
went
aaron
farr
redding
the
cutter
being
five
wagons
from
the
division
and
fourteen
from
the
they
started
about
half
an
hour
before
we
started
we
proceeded
at
and
immediately
after
starting
had
to
cross
a
very
steep
gulf
being
difficult
for
teams
to
get
up
though
it
was
not
long
soon
after
this
four
men
passed
us
with
pack
horses
and
mules
they
say
they
are
from
pueblo
and
going
to
green
river
they
told
others
they
were
from
santa
fe
and
going
to
san
francisco
we
found
the
road
very
hilly
and
uneven
and
crooked
as
yesterday
at
three
and
three
quarters
miles
passed
over
a
branch
of
the
la
bonte
a
stream
about
ten
feet
wide
but
not
deep
the
descent
and
ascent
being
very
steep
most
of
the
teams
required
assistance
to
get
up
for
half
a
mile
before
we
crossed
this
stream
and
three
and
a
half
miles
after
our
road
lay
over
a
kind
of
red
earth
or
sand
about
the
color
of
red
precipitate
most
of
the
rocks
and
bluffs
are
of
the
same
red
color
only
a
deeper
red
it
affected
my
eyes
much
from
its
brightness
and
strange
appearance
about
one
and
a
quarter
miles
west
of
the
creek
president
young
and
kimball
saw
a
large
toad
which
had
horns
on
its
head
and
a
tail
it
did
not
jump
like
a
toad
but
crawled
like
a
mouse
this
was
seen
near
a
large
pile
of
rock
or
rather
a
hill
at
we
halted
for
noon
having
come
ten
miles
since
breakfast
there
is
little
water
here
for
the
teams
the
day
fine
and
nice
west
breeze
the
road
is
very
crooked
hilly
and
mostly
rocky
many
large
cobble
stones
covering
the
bluffs
the
land
barren
and
little
grass
the
ground
here
is
covered
with
large
crickets
which
are
so
numerous
to
walk
without
stepping
on
them
is
almost
impossible
at
half
past
two
we
were
on
the
move
again
i
put
up
another
guide
board
a
little
east
of
the
creek
miles
we
found
the
road
much
better
this
afternoon
not
being
so
uneven
and
tolerably
straight
excepting
a
bluff
to
climb
a
mile
from
the
creek
at
the
foot
of
this
bluff
i
saw
a
toad
with
a
tail
like
a
lizard
about
three
inches
long
it
had
no
horns
but
there
was
the
appearance
of
horns
just
coming
on
each
side
of
the
head
it
resembles
a
lizard
in
color
tail
and
motion
when
running
swiftly
through
the
grass
its
hide
appeared
hard
and
on
its
sides
appeared
numerous
little
sharp
pointed
fins
or
pricks
in
other
respects
it
resembled
any
common
toad
at
a
quarter
past
one
we
formed
our
encampment
on
the
east
banks
of
a
stream
about
a
rod
wide
two
feet
deep
and
swift
current
it
is
named
the
a
la
pierre
we
have
traveled
eight
miles
this
afternoon
and
during
the
day
we
have
a
good
place
for
feed
but
the
higher
land
is
barren
abounding
only
in
wild
sage
there
are
still
some
high
bluffs
around
but
the
country
west
appears
much
more
level
the
evening
fine
but
cool
after
traveling
six
and
a
quarter
miles
from
noon

a
small
creek

the
morning
calm
and
very
pleasant
there
is
wild
mint
growing
on
the
bank
of
this
stream
in
great
plenty
and
abundance
of
wild
sage
on
all
the
higher
land
the
mint
smells
natural
but
the
sage
smells
strong
of
turpentine
and
a
little
like
camphor
started
at
half
past
seven
and
found
good
roads
at
four
and
a
half
miles
passed
over
a
small
creek
about
three
feet
wide
but
not
much
water
being
only
a
few
inches
deep
a
mile
farther
passed
another
creek
about
five
feet
wide
clear
water
and
plentiful
at
we
halted
on
the
east
bank
of
a
stream
about
thirty
feet
wide
and
tolerably
deep
with
a
rapid
current
having
come
eight
and
three
quarters
miles
we
have
had
several
long
steep
bluffs
to
ascend
and
descend
and
two
places
at
the
creeks
where
it
was
hard
for
the
teams
to
get
up
without
help
we
saw
one
of
the
missouri
companies
a
few
miles
ahead
of
us
edmund

an
antelope
there

good
feed
here

plentiful
our
road
has
been
crooked
mostly
winding
northward
the
creek
on
which
we
camped
last
night
is
named
a
la
pierre
and
about
a
mile
from
where
the
road
crosses
it
runs
through
a
tunnel
from
ten
to
twenty
rods
under
the
high
rocky
bluffs
the
tunnel
is
high
enough
for
a
man
to
stand
upright
in
it
and
when
standing
at
the
entrance
one
can
see
the
light
through
on
the
other
side
it
seems
as
though
this
tunnel
has
been
formed
by
some
strange
feat
of
nature
several
of
the
brethren
went
to
see
it
lewis
barney
and
another
brother
each
killed
an
antelope
which
were
brought
into
camp
during
the
halt
and
divided
the
brethren
carried
the
two
last
about
five
miles
on
their
shoulders
we
have
learned
today
from
one
of
the
travelers
that
there
is
one
man
living
and
making
a
farm
in
the
bear
river
valley
at
a
quarter
to
we
continued
our
journey
found
the
road
somewhat
more
even
and
good
traveling
i
put
a
guide
board
this
morning
at
miles
from
fort
john
and
this
afternoon
after
traveling
three
and
a
quarter
miles
from
noon
halt
i
put
up
another
mark
at
miles
just
as
i
finished
setting
it
i
looked
forward
and
saw
the
platte
river
again
after
descending
a
half
a
mile
we
were
on
its
banks
being
miles
since
we
left
it
on
saturday
last
after
having
wound
around
among
the
hills
and
bluffs
all
the
way
when
we
arrived
near
the
river
the
road
was
more
level
but
sandy
and
harder
on
our
teams
there
are
also
some
low
places
where
the
water
stands
making
it
soft
but
scarcely
any
feed
for
teams
since
we
left
the
creek
at
noon
at
a
quarter
to
six
we
passed
another
stream
about
thirty
feet
wide
and
two
feet
deep
swift
current
and
clear
water
name
is
deer
creek
there
is
plenty
of
timber
on
its
banks
and
abundance
of
good
rich
grass
for
our
teams
we
formed
our
encampment
on
the
west
bank
in
a
grove
of
large
timber
about
a
mile
back
we
passed
a
sick
horse
supposed
to
be
left
by
some
of
the
companies
ahead
brother
markham
bled
it
in
its
mouth
but
could
not
get
it
along
and
had
to
leave
it
the
distance
we
have
traveled
this
afternoon
was
nine
miles
and
during
the
day
miles
the
last
five
miles
being
nearly
a
west
course
soon
after
we
camped
horace
whitney
went
to
fishing
in
this
stream
we
were
soon
satisfied
that
there
are
plenty
of
fish
in
it
i
got
a
line
and
went
to
fishing
also
and
in
a
few
minutes
caught
two
which
would
weigh
a
half
a
pound
each
we
then
went
a
piece
below
the
ford
and
by
fishing
till
a
little
after
dark
i
caught
nice
fish
which
would
average
over
a
half
a
pound
each
and
some
of
them
would
weigh
over
a
pound
each
the
ones
i
caught
were
of
a
very
bright
color
and
very
much
resembled
the
herring
but
much
larger
horace
caught
a
cat
fish
and
two
suckers
a
number
of
brethren
also
caught
more
and
some
less
there
is
abundance
of
fish
in
this
stream
and
we
might
have
caught
enough
for
all
the
camp
with
the
sein
but
it
is
ahead
with
those
who
are
gone
to
build
a
raft
the
twelve
and
some
others
walked
out
together
to
the
river
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
up
the
stream
some
of
the
brethren
discovered
a
rich
bed
of
stone
coal
where
any
quantity
might
easily
be
dug
and
it
is
said
to
look
good
and
is
a
fine
quality
the
land
here
on
the
bottom
is
rich
and
would
doubtless
yield
good
crops
of
grain
and
potatoes
etc
lewis
barney
killed
an
antelope
this
afternoon
which
was
distributed
as
he
saw
fit
inasmuch
as
he
was
not
appointed
a
hunter
the
evening
is
very
fine
calm
and
pleasant
indeed
friday
june
arose
at
four
to
try
and
get
some
more
fish
morning
fine
and
warm
but
caught
only
four
i
procured
a
sample
of
the
stone
coal
from
smith
it
looks
good
this
place
reminds
me
of
england
the
calm
still
morning
with
the
warbling
of
many
birds
the
rich
grass
good
streams
and
plenty
of
timber
make
it
pleasant
at
we
again
continued
our
journey
along
the
banks
of
the
river
which
appears
somewhat
wider
here
than
at
laramie
at
two
and
a
half
miles
we
passed
a
deep
hollow
the
banks
on
both
sides
being
very
steep
at
four
and
a
quarter
miles
put
up
a
guide
board
at
miles
from
laramie
having
traveled
it
in
a
week
lacking
two
and
a
quarter
hours
at
we
halted
for
noon
in
a
grove
of
timber
where
there
is
plenty
of
good
feed
for
a
large
company
the
land
since
morning
has
been
generally
level
but
sandy
and
no
grass
the
road
somewhat
crooked
about
a
mile
back
we
came
around
a
bend
to
the
south
caused
by
a
deep
ravine
we
had
to
travel
more
than
a
mile
to
make
a
quarter
of
a
mile
direct
william
empey
edmund
elsworth
and
francis
pomeroy
each
killed
an
antelope
several
of
the
brethren
have
taken
an
interest
in
the
guide
boards
and
wherever
they
see
a
piece
of
board
sufficiently
large
they
pick
it
up
and
preserve
it
by
this
means
we
have
now
got
enough
to
last
miles
the
distance
we
have
traveled
since
morning
is
nine
and
a
quarter
miles
being
miles
in
the
week
including
sunday
or
miles
in
six
days
about
half
an
hour
after
we
halted
brother
joseph
hancock
came
in
with
the
hind
quarters
of
an
antelope
which
he
killed
about
three
miles
back
he
could
not
carry
the
remainder
and
left
it
on
the
ground
at
two
we
started
again
after
traveling
one
mile
we
crossed
a
very
crooked
muddy
creek
about
twelve
feet
wide
and
over
a
foot
deep
the
descent
and
ascent
were
both
bad
on
account
of
a
crook
from
one
to
the
other
there
is
plenty
of
feed
on
its
banks
but
no
wood
five
and
miles
farther
another
muddy
creek
about
three
feet
wide
and
bad
to
cross
on
account
of
the
clay
being
very
soft
in
its
banks
the
balance
of
the
road
good
but
considerably
crooked
at
half
past
five
we
came
to
a
halt
on
account
of
seeing
a
number
of
wagons
about
a
half
mile
ahead
which
proved
to
be
two
of
the
missouri
companies
camped
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
preparing
to
cross
here
it
was
also
ascertained
that
there
is
no
camping
place
beyond
them
unless
we
go
some
distance
it
was
decided
to
turn
off
to
the
river
opposite
where
we
are
and
camp
for
the
night
and
the
wagons
proceeded
accordingly
we
went
a
half
a
mile
from
the
road
and
at
six
formed
our
encampment
near
the
river
where
there
is
plenty
of
timber
having
come
on
the
road
this
afternoon
seven
and
miles
and
during
the
day
seventeen
miles
exclusive
of
the
distance
we
turned
off
to
camp
the
feed
here
is
good
and
plentiful
the
region
on
the
banks
of
the
river
is
pretty
level
but
a
few
miles
to
the
south
there
are
very
high
bluffs
very
little
chance
for
feed
except
in
places
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
generally
where
there
is
timber
these
missourian
companies
inform
us
that
the
regular
crossing
place
is
twelve
miles
farther
and
that
our
brethren
are
gone
on
there
and
also
the
balance
of
the
missourian
companies
these
men
have
got
a
light
flat
boat
with
them
and
have
already
got
one
load
over
they
say
they
have
killed
three
bears
between
here
and
the
bluffs
they
have
also
killed
a
buffalo
there
have
been
signs
of
bears
seen
by
our
brethren
a
number
of
times
but
no
bears
for
a
certainty
we
have
only
seen
one
buffalo
since
we
left
laramie
until
today
when
several
have
been
seen
one
of
the
missourians
brought
a
snow
ball
from
the
hill
on
the
south
he
gave
rockwood
a
piece
of
it
and
he
brought
it
to
camp
elder
kimball
and
several
others
saw
it
which
now
convinces
us
snow
is
yet
lying
on
these
high
bluffs
henson
walker
charles
barnum
and
brother
owens
have
each
killed
an
antelope
this
afternoon
making
eight
during
the
day
saturday
june
morning
very
fine
with
nice
east
breeze
brother
markham
has
learned
this
morning
that
obadiah
jennings
was
the
principal
in
killing
bowman
in
missouri
bowman
was
one
of
the
guard
who
let
joseph
and
hyrum
and
the
others
get
away
when
prisoners
in
missouri
the
mob
suspected
him
and
rode
him
on
a
bar
of
iron
till
they
killed
him
at
a
quarter
past
eight
we
continued
our
journey
at
one
and
a
half
miles
crossed
a
deep
gulch
pretty
difficult
to
descend
but
not
bad
to
ascend
one
and
miles
farther
we
crossed
a
small
creek
about
two
feet
wide
on
a
bridge
which
the
brethren
fixed
they
having
started
ahead
of
the
wagons
for
that
purpose
one
mile
beyond
the
last
mentioned
creek
we
crossed
another
muddy
stream
about
five
feet
wide
and
one
and
a
half
feet
deep
at
a
quarter
to
we
halted
after
crossing
another
large
ravine
having
traveled
seven
and
miles
over
a
sandy
barren
prairie
in
some
places
it
is
soft
although
the
soil
is
much
like
clay
in
appearance
the
road
somewhat
crooked
and
the
day
fine
and
warm
during
the
halt
brother
rockwood
called
upon
the
brethren
to
help
fix
another
ravine
immediately
west
of
us
many
turned
out
and
it
was
soon
done
james
case
and
markham
went
to
the
river
opposite
here
to
see
if
it
could
be
forded
they
waded
their
horses
over
and
found
the
water
about
four
feet
six
inches
deep
in
the
channel
and
the
current
very
swift
of
course
it
could
not
be
forded
with
loads
in
the
wagons
but
the
loading
would
have
to
be
ferried
in
the
boat
they
made
a
report
of
this
kind
on
their
return
to
camp
and
about
the
same
time
brother
chesley
came
down
from
the
brethren
ahead
and
reported
their
progress
and
the
nature
of
the
crossing
place
etc
a
number
of
the
brethren
in
company
with
elder
kimball
and
chesley
went
to
the
river
opposite
the
camp
to
decide
whether
to
cross
here
or
go
on
brother
markham
and
case
again
went
over
but
it
was
finally
concluded
to
go
up
to
the
other
ferry
we
accordingly
started
at
half
past
two
i
went
ahead
on
foot
at
three
and
a
quarter
miles
crossed
a
creek
about
five
feet
wide
at
half
past
four
the
encampment
was
formed
on
the
banks
of
the
river
having
come
four
miles
and
during
the
day
eleven
and
a
quarter
it
is
about
a
half
a
mile
from
our
camp
to
the
place
where
they
ferry
i
arrived
at
the
brethren
camp
at
four
and
learned
that
they
arrived
here
yesterday
about
noon
two
of
the
missourian
companies
arrived
about
the
same
time
the
brethren
concluded
that
a
raft
would
be
of
no
use
on
account
of
the
swiftness
of
the
current
the
missourian
company
offered
to
pay
them
well
if
they
would
carry
their
company
over
in
the
boat
and
a
contract
was
made
to
do
so
for
per
load
the
brethren
to
receive
their
pay
in
flour
at
per
hundred
they
commenced
soon
after
and
this
evening
finished
their
work
and
received
the
pay
mostly
in
flour
a
little
meal
and
some
bacon
they
have
made
with
the
cutter
all
in
provisions
which
is
a
great
blessing
to
the
camp
inasmuch
as
a
number
of
the
brethren
have
had
no
bread
stuff
for
some
days
during
the
afternoon
yesterday
one
of
the
men
of
the
missourian
company
undertook
to
swim
across
the
river
with
his
clothes
on
when
he
reached
the
current
he
became
frightened
and
began
to
moan
some
of
our
men
went
to
him
with
the
cutter
and
arrived
in
time
to
save
his
life
the
missourian
company
seem
to
feel
well
toward
us
and
express
their
joy
at
having
got
across
the
river
so
soon
rodney
badger
exchanged
wagons
with
one
of
them
and
got
a
wagon
as
good
as
his
own
only
the
tire
wants
setting
he
got
a
horse
lbs
flour
lbs
of
bacon
and
some
crackers
to
boot
the
provisions
and
horse
are
considered
to
be
worth
as
much
as
his
wagon
since
the
brethren
arrived
here
they
have
killed
three
buffalo
a
grizzly
bear
and
three
cubs
and
two
antelope
the
buffalo
are
very
fat
and
the
meat
is
good
and
sweet
according
to
the
idea
of
some
french
travelers
camped
here
the
buffalo
are
making
down
east
behind
the
hills
opposite
here
which
they
say
is
a
certain
sign
that
the
indians
are
on
sweet
water
hunting
them
the
brethren
say
that
the
buffalo
are
very
plentiful
back
of
these
hills
when
i
returned
to
camp
i
learned
that
tunis
rappleyee
and
artemas
johnson
were
missing
the
former
having
started
for
the
hills
to
get
a
little
snow
the
latter
having
been
hunting
all
day
a
company
were
sent
out
with
the
bugle
to
find
them
brother
rappleyee
returned
about
eleven
johnson
was
found
by
the
brethren
who
returned
still
later
all
agreeing
with
the
report
that
the
hills
are
eight
or
ten
miles
distance
although
they
do
not
appear
more
than
one
mile
there
were
four
antelope
killed
by
the
brethren
but
divided
according
to
the
feelings
of
those
who
killed
them
sunday
june
the
morning
fine
and
pleasant
at
nine
the
brethren
assembled
in
the
circle
for
prayer
and
after
they
had
spent
some
time
elder
kimball
arose
and
addressed
them
exhorting
them
to
be
watchful
and
humble
to
remember
their
covenants
and
above
all
things
avoid
everything
that
will
lead
to
division
etc
he
made
use
of
the
similitude
of
the
potter
and
the
clay
to
show
that
every
man
had
the
privilege
of
being
exalted
to
honor
and
glory
if
he
did
not
mar
in
the
hands
of
the
potter
but
would
continue
passive
etc
his
remarks
were
very
touching
and
appropriate
to
our
circumstances
president
young
followed
next
on
the
liberty
of
the
gospel
showing
that
it
guarantees
all
fullness
of
liberty
to
every
man
which
fact
will
tend
to
his
salvation
and
increase
but
does
not
give
us
liberty
to
break
the
laws
of
god
to
wander
off
to
the
mountains
and
get
lost
nor
to
kill
the
works
of
god
hands
to
waste
it
etc
he
was
followed
by
elder
pratt
on
the
subject
of
our
avoiding
all
excesses
of
folly
of
every
description
inasmuch
as
it
disqualifies
from
the
society
of
just
men
and
angels
he
exhorted
the
brethren
to
be
watchful
and
to
seek
after
wisdom
and
knowledge
the
meeting
was
dismissed
at
half
past
twelve
and
a
company
were
then
dispatched
to
get
poles
to
lash
the
wagons
together
to
prevent
their
rolling
over
when
crossing
another
company
were
sent
over
the
river
to
build
a
raft
to
cross
over
provisions
etc
the
brethren
are
gone
to
work
and
are
diligently
preparing
to
cross
the
river
tomorrow
the
day
has
been
very
hot
more
like
a
summer
day
than
any
we
have
yet
had
on
the
journey
the
ground
seems
to
be
alive
with
the
large
crickets
and
it
is
said
that
the
bears
feed
on
them
and
pick
them
up
very
fast
a
person
who
has
never
seen
them
could
form
no
idea
of
the
vast
numbers
of
crickets
in
this
region
i
spent
the
day
writing
in
elder
kimball
journal
phineas
young
came
in
from
the
mountain
having
killed
a
deer
monday
june
morning
cloudy
and
cool
at
four
the
first
division
commenced
ferrying
their
goods
over
the
river
in
the
cutter
and
some
time
afterwards
commenced
taking
the
wagons
across
on
a
raft
which
proved
to
be
very
slow
work
the
second
division
also
began
to
take
their
goods
over
on
a
raft
but
the
current
was
so
strong
they
only
took
two
loads
over
in
it
and
then
quit
the
second
division
then
got
a
rope
stretched
across
the
river
from
shore
to
shore
and
lashing
two
wagons
fast
together
to
keep
them
from
rolling
over
they
dragged
them
over
by
the
rope
letting
them
drift
with
the
current
to
save
breaking
the
rope
when
the
wagons
struck
on
the
sand
on
the
other
side
the
upper
one
keeled
over
and
finally
rolled
over
the
other
one
breaking
the
bows
considerably
and
losing
iron
in
the
wagon
to
the
amount
of
belonging
to
john
pack
the
other
wagon
had
the
reach
broken
and
some
of
the
bows
they
next
lashed
four
wagons
together
abreast
and
dragged
them
over
the
same
way
all
got
over
well
except
the
upper
one
which
turned
on
its
side
but
it
was
righted
again
without
damage
they
next
tried
one
wagon
alone
but
as
soon
as
it
got
into
the
current
it
rolled
over
and
over
breaking
the
bows
pretty
badly
the
plan
of
taking
one
wagon
at
a
time
on
a
raft
is
the
safest
no
accident
having
occurred
with
it
and
the
wagons
got
over
dry
but
it
is
very
slow
and
would
take
us
three
or
four
days
to
get
all
the
wagons
across
the
wind
blows
strong
from
the
southwest
which
is
much
to
our
disadvantage
at
we
had
a
very
heavy
thunder
storm
the
rain
was
heavy
indeed
accompanied
by
hail
and
as
strong
a
wind
as
i
ever
witnessed
after
the
storm
was
over
the
ferrying
was
continued
getting
my
trunk
and
the
loads
in
brother
johnson
and
harmon
wagons
over
and
also
harmon
wagon
johnson
being
got
over
just
before
the
storm
it
took
till
nearly
ten
to
get
the
loading
into
the
wagons
and
get
regulated
the
river
has
been
rising
all
day
and
has
risen
very
fast
since
the
storm
the
men
have
tried
hard
much
of
the
time
being
in
the
water
and
sometimes
up
to
their
armpits
which
is
very
fatiguing
indeed
when
they
quit
at
night
the
first
division
had
got
eleven
wagons
over
the
second
division
twelve
making
wagons
after
a
very
hard
day
labor
there
was
no
difficulty
in
getting
the
freight
over
for
one
man
can
carry
it
in
the
cutter
faster
than
all
the
rest
of
the
camp
can
get
the
wagons
over
tuesday
june
the
morning
fine
but
very
windy
the
brethren
continued
ferrying
wagons
over
on
the
raft
and
also
built
two
other
rafts
the
wind
being
so
high
they
could
not
get
along
very
fast
in
the
afternoon
they
commenced
driving
over
some
of
the
horses
and
cattle
belonging
to
brother
company
they
neglected
to
take
the
lariats
off
the
horses
and
the
buffalo
horse
was
soon
seen
to
be
drowning
some
of
the
men
immediately
went
to
it
with
the
skiff
and
dragged
him
to
the
shore
but
could
not
succeed
in
bringing
him
to
life
his
natural
make
seemed
to
hurt
him
from
swimming
the
rest
all
got
over
safely
the
cattle
got
over
safely
also
the
current
was
very
strong
the
wind
high
and
the
river
rising
which
made
it
look
dangerous
to
swim
the
cattle
across
it
was
concluded
today
to
leave
several
brethren
here
to
make
a
boat
and
keep
a
ferry
till
the
next
company
comes
up
by
that
means
they
will
probably
make
enough
to
supply
a
large
company
with
provisions
we
have
learned
from
a
missourian
that
there
is
a
large
company
of
emigrants
coming
up
on
the
north
side
of
the
platt
above
grand
island
there
are
doubtless
some
of
our
brethren
and
if
so
they
will
probably
reach
us
before
we
get
through
the
day
continued
windy
and
somewhat
inclined
to
storm
but
they
succeeded
in
getting
nearly
twenty
wagons
over
before
night
wednesday
june
the
morning
fine
but
strong
west
wind
the
brethren
continue
ferrying
a
company
have
gone
back
about
three
miles
to
make
two
canoes
on
which
they
intend
to
build
a
boat
to
be
used
here
till
the
next
company
comes
up
another
company
also
went
about
half
a
mile
up
the
river
to
make
slabs
or
puncheons
to
lay
on
the
canoes
a
while
before
dark
the
brethren
returned
from
below
with
two
good
canoes
feet
long
each
and
nearly
finished
and
ready
to
put
together
the
ferrying
continued
all
day
but
with
great
difficulty
on
account
of
the
strong
wind
blowing
down
stream
when
they
started
over
with
brother
wagon
the
wind
was
blowing
strong
james
craig
and
wordsworth
were
on
the
raft
with
poles
and
when
they
got
nearly
half
way
across
brother
craig
pole
stuck
in
the
sand
and
threw
him
overboard
he
swam
back
to
shore
and
in
spite
of
brother
wordsworth
exertions
the
wind
and
current
carried
the
raft
about
two
miles
down
the
river
it
was
finally
landed
by
the
help
of
the
cutter
and
without
accident
they
have
had
three
rafts
working
today
two
of
which
they
now
work
by
oars
which
are
proving
to
be
far
superior
to
poles
in
this
strong
current
at
the
close
of
day
there
were
still
a
number
of
wagons
on
the
south
shore
those
which
had
been
brought
over
could
not
be
easily
counted
on
account
of
their
being
scattered
all
along
the
banks
of
the
river
for
about
a
mile
in
length
it
was
now
contemplated
to
leave
a
company
of
brethren
at
this
ferry
to
ferry
over
the
gentile
companies
for
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
load
till
the
next
company
of
our
brethren
arrive
this
is
the
object
for
which
the
new
boat
is
being
built
they
will
thus
earn
a
good
stock
of
provisions
for
themselves
and
be
prepared
to
set
the
brethren
of
the
next
company
over
without
delay
and
will
also
be
able
to
preserve
the
boat
for
our
use
for
it
is
the
instructions
of
the
president
that
when
they
have
ferried
our
brethren
over
to
cache
the
boat
and
come
on
with
them
thursday
june
the
morning
fine
but
windy
and
cold
the
brethren
renewed
the
ferrying
early
and
soon
after
noon
they
had
got
the
last
wagon
safely
over
which
was
a
matter
of
rejoicing
to
all
the
camp
two
companies
of
the
missourians
had
arrived
and
made
application
to
be
set
over
at
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
load
when
the
contract
was
made
with
the
first
company
to
be
sent
across
as
soon
as
our
wagons
were
over
the
other
company
of
ten
wagons
offered
to
pay
the
brethren
per
man
extra
if
they
would
set
them
over
first
making
over
the
stated
price
for
ferriage
being
ten
of
the
brethren
to
work
at
it
colonel
rockwood
had
made
a
contract
to
the
above
effect
with
the
first
company
and
did
not
like
to
break
it
however
he
received
a
hint
that
this
was
colonel
day
for
the
use
of
the
boat
and
consequently
colonel
markham
had
a
right
to
take
the
last
offer
if
he
chose
he
took
the
hint
and
they
went
to
work
forthwith
at
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
wagon
in
provisions
at
missouri
prices
and
extra
per
man
in
what
they
preferred
for
themselves
the
afternoon
and
evening
was
very
cold
indeed
with
a
very
strong
wind
after
president
young
and
kimball
got
their
wagons
over
being
about
the
last
orders
were
given
for
the
camp
to
come
together
and
form
the
wagons
in
a
circle
near
the
ferry
it
took
till
near
dark
before
all
the
wagons
got
up
the
ferrying
was
continued
all
night
and
till
daylight
at
which
time
many
of
the
missourians
wagons
in
the
two
companies
were
over
friday
june
morning
very
cold
and
windy
the
brethren
continued
working
at
the
new
boat
others
continued
ferrying
the
missourians
wagons
over
it
was
concluded
not
to
start
today
but
wait
and
assist
in
finishing
the
boat
and
also
to
take
the
provisions
on
which
will
be
realized
from
these
two
companies
after
dinner
i
went
with
brother
pack
to
fish
in
the
last
creek
we
crossed
about
a
mile
and
a
half
distance
we
found
the
fish
numerous
and
had
good
luck
i
caught
very
nice
ones
which
would
average
half
a
pound
weight
each
about
six
i
started
back
but
found
i
had
got
more
than
i
could
easily
carry
to
camp
however
when
i
got
about
half
way
brother
cloward
met
me
and
helped
to
carry
them
we
arrived
at
the
camp
about
sundown
pretty
well
tired
the
afternoon
was
very
warm
and
pleasant
when
we
arrived
the
twelve
and
some
others
were
going
to
council
i
went
with
them
the
names
of
those
who
are
appointed
to
tarry
were
read
over
as
follows
thomas
grover
john
higbee
luke
johnson
appleton
harmon
edmund
ellsworth
francis
pomeroy
william
empey
james
davenport
and
benjamin
stewart
thomas
grover
was
appointed
captain
the
president
then
referred
to
brother
glines
who
was
wishful
to
stay
but
the
president
said
he
had
no
council
for
him
to
tarry
but
he
might
do
as
he
had
a
mind
to
some
explanations
followed
by
glines
but
the
unanimous
feeling
of
the
brethren
was
to
have
him
go
on
the
president
preached
a
short
sermon
for
the
benefit
of
the
young
elders
he
represented
them
as
being
continually
grasping
at
things
ahead
of
them
which
belong
to
others
he
said
the
way
for
young
elders
to
enlarge
their
dominion
and
power
is
to
go
to
the
world
and
preach
and
then
they
can
get
a
train
and
bring
it
up
to
the
house
of
the
lord
with
them
etc
the
letter
of
instructions
was
then
read
and
approved
by
the
brethren
and
the
council
was
then
dismissed
saturday
june
morning
fine
but
cool
at
the
camp
started
out
again
in
good
health
and
spirits
and
the
teams
in
very
good
order
it
was
remarked
by
several
that
their
stock
had
fattened
so
much
while
stopping
at
the
ferry
they
hardly
knew
them
the
grass
appears
to
be
rich
and
good
the
first
six
miles
of
the
road
was
nearly
in
a
west
direction
over
several
considerably
high
bluffs
at
that
distance
the
road
turns
suddenly
to
the
south
and
rises
up
a
very
high
bluff
which
is
upwards
of
a
mile
from
the
foot
to
the
summit
there
is
some
interesting
scenery
on
the
top
of
this
bluff
especially
a
range
of
rough
coarse
sandy
rocks
of
a
dark
brown
color
rising
abruptly
above
the
surface
of
the
land
in
huge
masses
and
ranging
east
and
west
the
descent
on
the
south
side
was
rough
crooked
and
uneven
and
about
half
way
down
was
a
bed
of
white
earth
mixed
with
black
in
places
and
others
yellow
in
one
place
you
can
pick
up
small
fragments
of
rock
of
each
color
within
a
yard
of
each
other
towards
the
foot
the
road
is
still
more
uneven
and
there
are
several
steep
pitches
and
rises
at
one
we
halted
for
noon
on
a
spot
of
good
grass
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
a
small
spring
which
is
the
first
water
we
have
come
to
since
leaving
the
ferry
which
is
eleven
and
a
quarter
miles
there
is
no
timber
nearer
than
the
bluffs
probably
two
miles
away
and
that
is
small
cedar
and
little
of
it
the
red
buttes
are
nearly
opposite
to
this
place
towards
the
southeast
and
appear
to
be
two
high
bluffs
of
red
earth
or
sand
presenting
a
very
triangular
yet
interesting
appearance
after
stopping
about
an
hour
it
was
decided
to
move
on
to
the
spring
and
we
started
accordingly
and
found
it
to
be
a
small
stream
of
water
rising
out
of
the
quick
sands
at
the
distance
of
twelve
miles
from
the
ferry
there
is
quite
a
lake
of
water
supposed
to
be
supplied
by
a
spring
indeed
we
could
see
the
water
boil
up
out
of
the
mud
in
several
places
the
grass
on
the
banks
of
this
lake
is
good
and
plentiful
but
no
timber
within
two
miles
or
upwards
after
watering
teams
at
the
lake
at
ten
minutes
to
three
we
continued
our
journey
bearing
near
a
southwest
course
over
rolling
prairie
at
the
distance
of
eight
miles
from
the
spring
there
is
a
steep
descent
from
a
bluff
and
at
the
foot
there
is
a
high
ridge
of
sharp
pointed
rocks
running
parallel
with
the
road
for
near
a
quarter
of
a
mile
leaving
only
sufficient
space
for
wagons
to
pass
at
the
south
point
there
is
a
very
large
rock
lying
close
to
where
the
road
makes
a
bend
making
it
somewhat
difficult
to
get
by
without
striking
it
the
road
is
also
very
rough
with
cobble
stones
at
we
formed
our
encampment
in
a
small
spot
surrounded
by
high
bluffs
having
traveled
this
afternoon
ten
and
a
quarter
miles
and
during
the
day
and
a
half
which
is
the
longest
distance
we
have
traveled
in
one
day
since
we
left
winter
quarters
and
this
is
considered
by
all
to
be
the
worst
camping
ground
we
have
had
on
the
journey
but
we
were
obliged
to
take
it
for
there
is
neither
wood
grass
nor
water
since
we
left
the
spring
the
land
being
perfectly
sandy
and
barren
and
nothing
growing
but
wild
sage
and
a
small
prickly
shrub
something
like
those
on
the
moors
in
lancashire
england
there
is
some
grass
in
this
place
for
our
teams
but
no
wood
the
brethren
have
to
make
use
of
the
wild
sage
and
buffalo
chips
to
do
their
cooking
there
are
two
small
streams
of
water
one
appears
to
come
from
the
northwest
and
is
not
very
bad
water
the
other
is
from
the
southwest
and
is
so
bad
that
cattle
will
not
drink
it
it
is
strong
of
salt
or
rather
saleratus
and
smells
extremely
filthy
its
banks
are
so
perfectly
soft
that
a
horse
or
ox
can
not
go
down
to
drink
without
sinking
immediately
nearly
overhead
in
thick
filthy
mud
and
is
one
of
the
most
horrid
swampy
stinking
places
i
ever
saw
it
was
found
necessary
to
keep
a
guard
out
to
prevent
the
cattle
from
getting
into
it
and
orders
were
given
to
drive
them
down
a
little
east
where
feed
is
pretty
good
and
it
is
not
so
dangerous
of
their
miring
the
mosquitoes
are
very
bad
indeed
at
this
place
which
adds
to
the
loathsome
solitary
scenery
around
porter
rockwell
returned
from
hunting
soon
after
we
had
camped
and
reported
that
he
had
killed
a
fat
buffalo
about
two
miles
off
a
team
was
sent
to
fetch
in
the
meat
which
they
did
not
return
till
long
after
dark
elder
kimball
saw
six
buffalo
while
riding
ahead
to
look
out
a
camp
ground
they
are
represented
as
being
more
tame
myers
killed
two
buffalo
but
took
only
the
tallow
and
tongues
and
left
the
rest
to
rot
on
the
ground
john
norton
and
andrew
gibbons
left
the
camp
at
the
springs
and
went
out
to
hunt
expecting
we
should
stay
there
till
monday
gibbons
has
not
been
seen
or
heard
of
since
norton
has
returned
and
reports
that
he
has
killed
a
buffalo
and
left
it
back
not
far
from
the
spring
about
nine
there
was
an
alarm
that
an
ox
had
mired
he
was
nearly
covered
but
soon
got
out
again
sunday
june
morning
fine
mosquitoes
very
bad
two
more
oxen
found
almost
buried
in
the
mud
and
all
hands
appeared
wishful
to
leave
this
place
and
at
a
quarter
past
five
we
moved
out
the
first
mile
was
bad
traveling
there
being
several
steep
pitches
in
the
road
making
it
dangerous
for
axletrees
a
number
of
the
brethren
went
ahead
with
picks
and
spades
and
improved
the
road
somewhat
after
traveling
three
and
three
quarters
miles
we
halted
for
breakfast
at
seven
beside
a
small
clear
stream
of
spring
water
about
a
foot
wide
but
plenty
for
camping
purposes
the
feed
on
its
banks
good
and
plentiful
but
no
wood
yet
elder
kimball
states
that
when
he
and
elder
benson
were
riding
ahead
last
evening
to
look
out
a
camping
ground
they
came
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
this
place
but
were
not
near
enough
to
discover
the
water
a
while
before
they
arrived
here
as
they
were
riding
slowly
along
they
saw
six
men
suddenly
spring
up
from
the
grass
to
the
left
of
the
road
the
men
were
clothed
in
blankets
some
white
and
some
blue
and
had
every
appearance
of
being
indians
and
the
brethren
thought
they
were
indians
the
six
mounted
their
horses
and
started
on
in
a
direction
parallel
with
the
road
the
brethren
also
kept
on
their
course
in
a
little
while
one
of
the
supposed
indians
left
the
rest
and
rode
towards
the
brethren
and
motioned
with
his
hand
for
them
to
go
back
they
however
kept
on
and
paid
no
attention
to
his
motion
when
he
saw
them
still
coming
he
wheeled
round
and
joined
the
others
who
all
put
spurs
to
their
horses
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
behind
a
higher
piece
of
land
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
elder
kimball
and
benson
spurred
their
horses
and
rode
to
the
ridge
and
as
they
arrived
there
they
discovered
a
camp
of
the
missourians
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
left
of
the
road
and
the
six
indians
were
just
entering
the
camp
the
brethren
were
now
satisfied
that
these
indians
were
missourians
and
had
taken
this
plan
to
keep
us
back
from
this
good
camp
ground
it
is
considered
as
an
old
missouri
trick
and
an
insult
to
the
camp
and
if
they
undertake
to
play
indian
again
it
is
more
than
likely
they
will
meet
with
indian
treatment
their
camp
left
here
a
little
before
we
arrived
this
morning
and
it
is
now
president
intention
to
press
on
a
little
faster
and
crowd
them
up
a
little
we
have
learned
from
one
of
the
emigrants
a
few
miles
in
our
rear
that
andrew
gibbons
tarried
with
their
camp
over
night
when
he
returned
to
the
spring
and
found
our
camp
gone
and
the
missourians
camp
there
he
told
them
of
the
dead
buffalo
killed
by
norton
they
went
and
fetched
what
meat
they
wanted
and
feasted
on
it
he
joining
with
them
and
faring
well
at
a
quarter
past
nine
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
after
traveling
three
miles
we
arrived
at
the
willow
spring
and
halted
a
little
while
to
get
water
this
spring
is
about
two
feet
wide
and
the
water
ten
inches
deep
perfectly
clear
cold
as
ice
water
and
very
good
tasting
there
is
a
willow
grove
extending
for
some
distance
above
and
below
it
which
will
answer
very
well
for
firing
purposes
the
grass
is
good
and
plentiful
and
it
is
one
of
the
loveliest
camping
spots
i
have
seen
on
the
journey
though
the
land
where
the
stream
runs
below
the
spring
is
soft
and
some
danger
of
cattle
miring
the
spring
is
situated
between
two
very
high
hills
and
is
about
three
rods
west
of
the
road
and
shielded
from
the
sun
by
a
bank
about
eight
feet
high
and
the
willow
grove
a
little
piece
before
we
arrived
at
the
spring
there
are
two
very
deep
ravines
to
cross
which
requires
some
care
on
the
part
of
the
teamsters
to
prevent
accidents
at
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
the
spring
we
began
to
ascend
a
very
high
hill
which
was
one
mile
from
the
foot
to
the
top
and
the
ascent
pretty
steep
the
summit
of
this
hill
is
nicely
rounding
and
considered
to
be
much
the
highest
we
have
traveled
over
from
the
top
can
be
seen
a
vast
extent
of
country
to
the
south
west
and
north
for
about
twenty
or
thirty
miles
to
the
south
there
appears
to
be
a
tolerably
level
bottom
over
which
our
future
road
runs
beyond
this
there
are
vast
ranges
of
high
hills
whose
summits
are
spotted
with
snow
in
the
distance
to
the
southwest
can
be
seen
a
small
body
of
water
which
we
suppose
to
be
a
part
of
the
sweet
water
river
to
the
west
the
ridges
of
rocks
or
hills
appear
nearer
they
are
probably
not
over
fifteen
miles
from
us
on
the
north
we
can
see
hills
a
long
distance
the
one
opposite
red
buttes
near
the
spring
where
we
halted
yesterday
noon
appears
only
a
few
miles
distance
the
view
from
this
hill
is
one
of
romantic
beauty
which
can
not
easily
be
surpassed
and
as
president
young
remarked
would
be
a
splendid
place
for
a
summer
mansion
to
keep
tavern
we
then
descended
on
the
southwest
corner
of
the
hill
and
found
it
to
be
just
one
mile
farther
to
the
foot
at
the
distance
of
three
quarters
of
a
mile
farther
we
found
a
good
place
for
feed
being
plenty
of
grass
but
no
water
nor
wood
at
a
mile
and
a
quarter
still
farther
we
crossed
a
very
bad
slough
which
is
about
a
rod
across
and
following
the
road
nearly
three
feet
deep
in
water
and
stiff
mud
most
of
the
wagons
crossed
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
road
and
found
it
not
so
difficult
to
cross
yet
very
soft
there
is
also
plenty
of
good
grass
at
this
spot
a
mile
beyond
this
slough
we
ascended
a
very
steep
bluff
though
not
very
high
and
the
descent
on
the
southwest
is
also
very
steep
at
we
halted
to
feed
in
a
ravine
where
there
is
plenty
of
grass
and
a
good
stream
of
water
about
three
hundred
yards
south
from
the
road
but
destitute
of
wood
we
have
traveled
this
forenoon
nine
miles
over
barren
sandy
land
being
no
grass
only
in
the
spots
above
mentioned
during
the
halt
it
was
decided
that
president
young
take
the
lead
with
his
wagon
and
try
to
proceed
a
little
faster
at
five
we
again
proceeded
the
president
wagon
going
first
all
the
others
keeping
their
places
i
will
here
remark
that
it
is
the
order
of
our
traveling
for
each
company
of
ten
to
go
forward
in
their
turn
the
first
ten
in
the
first
division
taking
the
lead
one
day
then
on
the
second
day
it
falls
in
the
rear
of
the
first
division
the
second
ten
takes
the
lead
and
this
continues
till
each
company
of
ten
have
taken
the
lead
one
day
a
piece
then
the
first
division
falls
in
the
rear
of
the
second
division
which
also
begins
by
companies
of
ten
to
take
the
lead
of
the
road
as
stated
above
and
when
each
ten
have
had
their
day
the
second
division
again
falls
in
the
rear
of
the
first
which
continues
in
the
same
order
thus
every
man
has
his
equal
privilege
of
traveling
one
with
another
after
traveling
two
and
a
half
miles
we
descended
to
the
bottom
land
again
and
saw
a
small
stream
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
road
where
there
is
plenty
of
grass
one
and
three
quarters
miles
farther
we
crossed
a
creek
of
tolerably
clear
water
about
six
feet
wide
and
one
foot
deep
but
neither
grass
nor
timber
on
its
banks
after
traveling
seven
miles
this
afternoon
we
turned
off
from
the
road
to
the
left
and
at
formed
our
encampment
on
a
ridge
near
the
last
mentioned
creek
where
there
is
good
feed
having
traveled
this
afternoon
seven
and
a
quarter
miles
exclusive
of
allowance
for
turning
from
the
road
and
during
the
day
twenty
miles
we
had
been
in
hopes
of
reaching
the
sweet
water
but
it
appears
we
are
yet
some
miles
from
it
the
whole
country
around
is
entirely
destitute
of
timber
not
a
tree
to
be
seen
nor
a
shrub
larger
than
the
wild
sage
which
abounds
in
all
this
region
of
country
and
will
answer
for
cooking
when
nothing
else
can
be
found
some
anxiety
is
felt
on
account
of
the
absence
of
elder
woodruff
and
john
brown
they
started
ahead
this
morning
with
instructions
to
go
on
about
fifteen
miles
and
if
they
found
a
good
place
to
camp
to
stay
they
have
not
been
seen
or
heard
of
since
it
is
supposed
they
have
fallen
in
with
some
of
the
companies
either
forward
or
back
and
have
concluded
to
tarry
with
them
over
night
monday
june
morning
very
fine
and
warm
from
this
place
we
can
see
a
huge
pile
of
rocks
to
the
southwest
a
few
miles
we
have
supposed
this
to
be
the
rock
of
independence
after
breakfast
i
went
to
view
it
and
found
that
it
was
a
vast
pile
of
rocks
extending
from
south
to
north
about
five
hundred
feet
and
in
width
one
hundred
feet
the
rocks
are
large
and
seem
piled
on
one
another
with
the
edges
up
there
is
no
earth
on
the
ridge
but
a
little
drift
sand
in
which
there
are
currant
and
rose
bushes
growing
i
saw
a
large
mouse
on
the
top
which
had
a
long
bushy
tail
like
a
squirrel
it
sat
up
and
acted
in
every
respect
like
a
squirrel
but
in
size
and
color
resembled
a
mouse
at
the
camp
proceeded
onward
after
traveling
three
and
a
quarter
miles
we
arrived
on
a
bed
of
saleratus
which
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
across
and
on
which
were
several
lakes
of
salt
water
this
place
looks
swampy
and
smells
bad
the
beds
of
saleratus
smell
like
lime
but
the
saleratus
itself
is
said
to
raise
bread
equal
to
the
best
bought
in
eastern
markets
lorenzo
young
gathered
a
pail
full
in
a
short
time
with
a
view
to
test
its
qualities
large
quantities
may
be
gathered
in
a
short
time
and
when
pulverized
it
looks
clean
and
nice
we
are
now
satisfied
that
the
water
we
saw
from
the
hills
yesterday
must
have
been
some
of
these
lakes
as
the
sweet
water
is
not
yet
in
sight
but
these
being
high
show
at
a
long
distance
the
water
is
not
very
salty
but
brackish
and
tastes
sickly
it
is
reported
by
travelers
that
these
are
poisonous
but
it
is
probable
that
all
the
poison
there
is
about
them
is
their
salt
causing
cattle
to
drink
freely
when
they
can
get
no
other
water
and
the
more
they
drink
the
more
thirsty
they
get
till
they
burst
themselves
which
is
said
to
be
the
effect
of
drinking
the
poison
to
burst
as
we
passed
along
a
little
farther
we
saw
another
large
lake
to
the
left
and
one
to
the
right
of
the
same
nature
their
banks
mostly
white
with
saleratus
at
twelve
we
arrived
on
the
banks
of
the
sweet
water
having
traveled
seven
and
a
half
miles
over
a
very
sandy
road
destitute
of
wood
water
or
grass
the
distance
from
the
upper
ferry
of
the
platte
river
to
this
place
is
miles
by
the
roadometer
there
has
formerly
been
a
ford
here
but
lately
emigrants
have
found
a
better
ford
higher
up
the
river
at
this
place
the
river
is
probably
seven
or
eight
rods
wide
and
over
three
feet
deep
at
the
ford
but
in
some
places
it
is
much
deeper
still
the
current
is
very
swift
the
water
a
little
muddy
but
pleasant
tasting
by
watching
it
closely
it
is
easy
to
see
on
the
surface
numerous
small
bright
particles
floating
which
at
first
sight
might
be
supposed
to
be
salt
however
the
water
itself
has
not
the
least
saline
taste
on
the
banks
of
the
river
there
is
plenty
of
good
grass
but
destitute
of
wood
there
being
only
one
solitary
tree
to
be
seen
and
that
stands
beside
this
fording
place
the
only
chance
for
fuel
appears
to
be
the
wild
sage
and
other
small
shrubbery
occasionally
growing
in
spots
on
the
low
banks
after
we
halted
sister
harriet
young
made
some
bread
using
the
lake
saleratus
and
when
baked
was
pronounced
to
raise
the
bread
and
taste
equal
to
the
best
she
had
ever
used
and
it
requires
less
of
this
than
the
common
saleratus
a
number
of
the
brethren
went
back
during
the
halt
and
filled
their
pails
with
it
calculating
to
make
use
of
it
during
our
future
journey
the
day
has
been
very
hot
and
no
wind
which
makes
it
unpleasant
traveling
elder
woodruff
and
brown
again
joined
the
camp
on
our
arrival
here
and
reported
that
they
had
spent
the
night
in
one
of
the
gentile
camps
which
are
now
some
miles
ahead
of
us
there
are
many
high
hills
or
ridges
of
the
granite
rock
in
the
neighborhood
especially
in
the
east
and
west
all
entirely
destitute
of
vegetation
and
which
present
a
very
wild
and
desolate
as
well
as
romantic
aspect
i
can
describe
their
appearance
only
by
saying
that
it
seems
as
though
giants
had
in
days
taken
them
in
wheelbarrows
of
tremendous
size
and
wheeled
up
in
large
heaps
masses
of
heavy
clay
which
has
consolidated
and
become
solid
hard
rock
the
rock
independence
lies
a
little
west
of
where
we
have
halted
and
after
dinner
i
went
to
view
it
as
well
as
many
others
it
lies
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
in
this
shape
the
extreme
southeast
corner
reaches
to
within
about
three
rods
of
the
river
and
runs
in
a
direction
northwest
while
the
river
at
this
place
runs
nearly
a
west
course
it
is
composed
of
the
same
barren
granite
as
other
masses
in
this
region
and
is
probably
yards
long
yards
wide
and
yards
in
perpendicular
height
as
near
as
i
could
guess
the
ascent
is
difficult
all
around
travelers
appear
to
have
ascended
it
mostly
at
the
southeast
corner
where
there
are
some
hundreds
of
names
of
persons
who
have
visited
it
both
male
and
female
painted
on
the
projecting
surfaces
with
black
red
and
some
with
yellow
paint
about
half
way
up
there
is
a
cavern
about
twelve
feet
long
and
three
feet
wide
at
the
bottom
but
at
the
top
about
ten
feet
wide
and
eight
feet
high
formed
by
a
very
large
heavy
mass
of
rock
having
sometime
fallen
over
an
opening
or
cavity
leaving
scarcely
room
enough
for
a
man
to
enter
however
there
are
three
places
by
which
it
may
be
entered
though
not
without
difficulty
there
are
a
number
of
names
inside
the
cavern
put
on
with
black
paint
doubtless
being
the
names
of
persons
who
have
visited
it
on
the
top
of
the
rock
the
surface
is
a
little
rounding
something
like
a
large
mound
with
large
masses
of
loose
rock
lying
scattered
around
proceeding
forward
you
descend
when
nearly
half
way
of
the
length
to
a
considerably
lower
surface
which
continues
some
distance
and
then
rises
high
again
to
about
the
same
height
as
the
first
section
on
the
top
there
are
a
number
of
small
pools
of
water
no
doubt
collected
during
heavy
rains
and
having
no
chance
to
run
off
they
stand
until
evaporated
into
the
atmosphere
some
of
the
pools
are
eight
inches
deep
and
taste
like
rain
water
it
is
more
difficult
descending
from
the
rock
than
to
ascend
it
on
account
of
its
being
hard
and
slippery
and
nothing
to
hang
on
and
a
visitor
has
to
be
careful
or
he
will
arrive
on
the
ground
with
bruised
limbs
at
three
they
started
on
and
on
arriving
at
the
rock
found
it
to
be
one
and
a
quarter
miles
from
noon
halt
we
put
up
a
guide
board
opposite
the
rock
with
this
inscription
on
it
to
fort
john
miles
pioneers
june
the
letters
are
branded
on
all
the
guide
boards
at
the
request
so
as
to
have
a
mark
that
the
saints
might
know
and
his
brand
is
generally
known
by
the
saints
after
traveling
on
the
banks
of
the
river
one
mile
beyond
the
rock
we
forded
over
and
found
it
nearly
three
feet
deep
in
the
channel
all
the
wagons
got
over
without
difficulty
or
much
loss
of
time
we
then
continued
a
southwest
course
four
and
a
half
miles
farther
and
arrived
opposite
devil
gate
which
lies
a
little
to
the
west
of
the
road
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
this
the
road
passes
between
two
high
ridges
of
granite
leaving
a
surface
of
about
two
rods
of
level
ground
on
each
side
the
road
the
road
then
bends
to
the
west
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
passes
over
a
small
creek
two
feet
wide
but
bad
crossing
on
account
of
its
being
deep
and
muddy
requiring
caution
in
the
teamsters
to
prevent
accident
president
young
kimball
and
others
went
to
view
the
north
side
of
devil
gate
and
returning
reported
that
the
devils
would
not
let
them
pass
or
meaning
that
it
was
impossible
to
go
through
the
gateway
so
called
we
proceeded
on
a
little
farther
and
at
formed
our
encampment
on
the
bank
of
the
river
having
traveled
this
afternoon
seven
and
three
quarters
miles
and
during
the
day
fifteen
and
a
quarter
the
feed
here
is
good
and
plentiful
and
a
little
cedar
can
be
obtained
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
rocky
ridges
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
back
after
we
had
camped
i
went
back
to
view
the
devil
gate
where
the
river
runs
between
two
high
rocky
ridges
for
the
distance
of
about
yards
the
rock
on
the
east
side
is
perpendicular
and
was
found
by
a
barometrical
measurements
by
elder
pratt
to
be
feet
inches
high
the
one
on
the
west
side
is
about
the
same
height
but
not
perpendicular
bending
a
little
from
the
river
gradually
to
the
top
the
river
has
a
channel
of
about
three
rods
in
width
through
this
pass
which
increases
its
swiftness
and
dashing
furiously
against
the
huge
fragments
of
rock
which
have
fallen
from
the
mountain
makes
a
roar
which
can
be
heard
plainly
in
the
camp
one
of
the
brethren
fired
off
his
rifle
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
and
the
report
resembled
much
like
that
of
a
cannon
others
tumbled
fragments
of
rocks
from
a
projection
at
the
entrance
about
feet
high
which
made
a
very
loud
rumbling
sound
caused
by
the
echoes
the
scenery
is
one
of
romantic
grandeur
and
it
seems
wonderful
how
the
river
could
ever
find
a
channel
through
such
a
mass
of
heavy
solid
rock
the
view
from
this
encampment
over
the
surrounding
country
is
sublime
to
the
east
south
and
southwest
the
sweet
water
mountains
tower
high
and
appear
spotted
with
snow
and
about
twenty
to
thirty
miles
distance
from
the
river
to
the
west
are
also
hills
and
ridges
interspersed
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
except
the
land
immediately
on
the
river
which
appears
even
for
many
miles
these
high
barren
rocky
ridges
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
seem
to
continue
for
many
miles
tuesday
june
morning
fine
at
we
continued
our
journey
and
about
yards
from
where
we
camped
crossed
a
very
crooked
creek
about
six
feet
wide
descending
from
the
southwest
after
traveling
three
miles
over
heavy
sandy
roads
we
crossed
another
creek
about
six
feet
wide
and
three
and
three
quarters
miles
farther
a
creek
two
feet
wide
somewhere
near
this
last
creek
brother
lorenzo
young
broke
one
of
his
axle
trees
which
detained
him
some
time
one
of
the
missourian
companies
came
up
soon
after
the
accident
and
took
his
load
into
one
of
their
wagons
and
by
splicing
a
piece
of
wood
on
his
axle
tree
he
was
enabled
to
follow
our
camp
at
we
halted
on
the
banks
of
the
river
having
traveled
ten
miles
over
a
very
sandy
barren
land
there
being
no
grass
only
on
the
creeks
and
river
banks
during
the
halt
elder
pratt
took
an
observation
and
found
the
latitude
of
this
place
president
young
went
back
to
meet
lorenzo
but
soon
found
he
was
coming
on
with
the
missourian
company
who
were
approaching
near
us
he
immediately
turned
about
and
on
arriving
back
gave
orders
to
get
up
the
teams
and
proceed
so
as
to
keep
ahead
of
the
other
company
who
say
they
have
traveled
from
independence
rock
without
halting
however
they
passed
before
we
could
start
and
got
ahead
of
us
the
day
has
been
hot
and
a
little
wind
at
we
continued
finding
the
road
again
leaving
the
river
at
half
a
mile
we
passed
a
very
large
lake
on
our
left
which
covers
an
area
of
over
acres
of
land
its
banks
are
mostly
white
with
the
alkali
or
saleratus
after
passing
this
lake
the
road
runs
south
passing
between
high
sandy
bluffs
after
which
it
again
turns
around
gradually
towards
the
west
and
descending
a
steep
bluff
over
very
heavy
sandy
land
after
traveling
five
and
three
quarters
miles
crossed
a
creek
about
six
feet
wide
and
a
foot
deep
the
bank
on
each
side
is
very
steep
and
sandy
making
it
difficult
for
teams
to
get
up
here
sterling
driggs
had
his
harness
broken
to
pieces
by
his
horses
springing
suddenly
when
attempting
to
rise
out
of
the
creek
they
cleared
themselves
from
the
wagon
which
was
hauled
up
by
a
yoke
of
oxen
so
as
not
to
hinder
the
rest
from
crossing
the
banks
of
this
creek
are
well
lined
with
sage
instead
of
grass
which
is
very
large
and
thick
on
the
ground
on
account
of
which
elder
kimball
named
this
sage
creek
after
passing
this
creek
one
and
three
quarters
miles
we
again
arrived
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
continued
to
travel
near
to
it
at
two
and
a
quarter
miles
farther
crossed
a
creek
three
feet
wide
but
not
much
to
be
depended
on
for
water
at
we
formed
our
encampment
at
the
foot
of
a
very
high
gravelly
bluff
and
near
the
river
having
traveled
this
afternoon
ten
and
three
quarters
miles
and
during
the
day
twenty
and
three
quarters
miles
over
mostly
a
very
sandy
road
this
is
a
very
good
camp
ground
there
being
plenty
of
grass
for
our
teams
which
is
well
worth
traveling
a
few
miles
extra
from
this
place
the
country
seems
fortified
by
hills
and
mountains
especially
on
the
west
lewis
barney
and
joseph
hancock
have
each
killed
an
antelope
during
the
day
but
there
appears
to
be
no
buffalo
in
the
neighborhood
wednesday
june
morning
fine
and
warm
after
breakfast
i
went
to
the
top
of
the
high
bluff
expecting
to
get
a
good
view
of
the
country
west
but
was
disappointed
in
consequence
of
the
many
ridges
or
bluffs
but
a
little
distance
beyond
us
at
seven
the
camp
moved
forward
and
immediately
after
saw
a
graveyard
on
the
left
of
the
road
with
a
board
stuck
up
with
these
words
written
on
it
matilda
crowley
july
and
july
on
reflecting
afterward
that
some
of
the
numerous
emigrants
who
had
probably
started
with
a
view
to
spend
the
remainder
of
their
days
in
the
wild
oregon
had
fallen
by
the
way
and
their
remains
had
to
be
left
by
their
friends
far
from
the
place
of
destination
i
felt
a
renewed
anxiety
that
the
lord
will
kindly
preserve
the
lives
of
all
my
family
that
they
may
be
permitted
to
gather
to
the
future
home
of
the
saints
enjoy
the
society
of
the
people
of
god
for
many
years
to
come
and
when
their
days
are
numbered
that
their
remains
may
be
deposited
at
the
feet
of
the
servants
of
god
rather
than
be
left
far
away
in
a
wild
country
and
oh
lord
grant
this
sincere
desire
of
thy
servant
in
the
name
of
thy
son
jesus
amen
after
traveling
one
and
a
half
miles
we
crossed
a
very
shoal
stream
of
clear
cold
water
about
five
feet
wide
there
is
but
little
grass
here
although
a
number
of
bitter
cottonwood
trees
grow
on
the
banks
there
being
no
name
on
the
map
for
this
creek
it
was
named
bitter
cottonwood
creek
to
designate
it
in
our
future
travel
it
is
probable
that
this
stream
is
caused
by
the
melting
of
the
snow
on
the
mountains
and
if
so
could
not
be
depended
on
for
a
camp
ground
late
in
the
summer
after
passing
this
creek
the
river
runs
between
some
of
the
high
rocky
ridges
the
road
at
the
same
time
bending
a
little
southwest
to
pass
around
them
after
traveling
five
miles
beyond
the
last
mentioned
creek
we
again
descended
to
the
banks
of
the
river
where
would
be
a
pretty
good
camp
ground
although
the
grass
is
not
so
plentiful
as
in
many
other
places
on
the
banks
of
the
river
we
traveled
till
on
the
river
banks
then
halted
for
noon
where
the
road
and
river
separated
a
little
farther
and
hence
we
would
probably
not
find
grass
again
for
a
number
of
miles
the
land
continues
very
sandy
making
it
hard
on
teams
our
course
about
west
the
day
very
warm
with
a
light
south
breeze
we
traveled
eight
and
a
half
miles
this
morning
there
are
some
small
cedar
trees
on
the
rocky
bluffs
which
is
the
only
timber
seen
since
we
passed
the
bitter
cottonwood
latitude
of
this
place
at
we
continued
our
journey
and
after
proceeding
half
a
mile
found
the
river
turns
between
the
granite
ridges
in
a
northwest
direction
and
seems
to
have
but
a
narrow
space
to
pass
through
in
several
places
the
road
at
the
same
place
turns
south
to
avoid
the
ridges
for
over
a
mile
and
then
bends
to
the
southwest
for
some
distance
farther
the
road
at
the
foot
of
these
rocky
hills
is
extremely
sandy
and
heavy
traveling
on
arriving
at
the
south
side
of
the
hills
we
were
suddenly
cheered
with
a
very
plain
view
of
the
wind
river
chain
of
the
rocky
mountains
towering
high
up
in
the
air
and
perfectly
white
with
snow
some
of
the
peaks
appear
to
run
up
very
high
but
we
are
evidently
many
miles
from
them
yet
after
we
passed
this
place
the
road
gradually
bends
to
the
west
and
northwest
and
at
the
distance
of
six
and
three
quarters
miles
from
our
noon
halt
brings
us
to
the
banks
of
the
river
again
we
continued
on
the
banks
of
the
river
till
at
which
time
we
formed
our
encampment
having
traveled
this
afternoon
eight
and
a
half
miles
and
during
the
day
seventeen
as
usual
there
is
plenty
of
grass
on
the
river
banks
but
no
wood
there
are
some
dry
buffalo
chips
and
wild
sage
which
answer
tolerably
well
for
cooking
the
land
over
which
we
have
traveled
except
in
the
several
places
above
mentioned
is
perfectly
barren
except
for
wild
sage
which
abounds
but
there
is
scarcely
a
spear
of
grass
to
be
seen
these
granite
ridges
continue
from
the
rock
independence
to
this
place
mostly
on
the
north
side
the
river
here
they
recede
from
the
river
a
few
miles
and
then
cease
there
are
two
of
the
missourian
companies
camped
one
about
a
half
a
mile
and
the
other
a
mile
west
of
us
and
we
are
given
to
understand
we
have
got
a
long
distance
to
travel
without
grass
or
water
it
is
stated
that
a
man
from
one
of
these
companies
left
his
company
a
few
days
ago
and
went
ahead
to
examine
the
route
etc
on
their
arrival
here
they
found
him
in
one
of
these
rocky
hills
hid
up
for
fear
of
the
indians
he
reports
that
he
has
been
to
the
pass
and
that
we
shall
find
water
about
fourteen
miles
from
here
he
has
come
from
the
pass
in
two
nights
and
hid
up
in
the
day
time
to
avoid
indians
but
has
seen
none
he
says
it
is
not
over
miles
to
the
pass
from
here
after
we
camped
burr
frost
set
up
his
forge
and
set
some
wagon
tires
and
repaired
the
wheels
of
the
wagons
for
one
of
the
missourians
there
are
no
buffalo
to
be
seen
yet
and
not
much
game
of
any
kind
lewis
barney
killed
two
antelope
and
the
brethren
mostly
killed
one
or
two
every
day
the
sweet
water
mountains
do
not
appear
very
high
but
have
considerable
snow
lying
on
them
in
some
places
they
appear
to
run
nearly
parallel
with
the
river
to
about
from
twenty
to
thirty
miles
distance
to
the
south
thursday
june
morning
fine
but
cool
it
was
calculated
to
make
an
early
start
so
as
to
pass
the
two
companies
of
the
missourians
and
get
the
best
chance
for
feed
at
night
but
they
started
out
a
half
an
hour
before
we
were
ready
we
proceeded
onward
at
and
a
little
over
a
mile
from
where
we
camped
found
the
river
again
bending
northwest
while
the
road
continues
near
a
west
course
and
soon
rises
a
high
bluff
on
the
top
of
this
we
appear
to
have
a
level
road
for
many
miles
after
traveling
five
miles
from
morning
we
arrived
at
a
level
strip
of
land
on
the
north
side
of
the
road
where
there
is
plenty
of
grass
and
apparently
swampy
and
soft
it
extends
in
the
same
direction
with
the
road
a
mile
and
a
half
and
appears
to
terminate
where
the
road
crosses
the
lower
land
although
the
grass
and
hollow
continue
southward
for
some
distance
just
above
where
the
road
crosses
at
the
west
end
there
is
some
water
standing
around
a
small
circular
swampy
spot
of
land
probably
about
a
half
an
acre
near
the
edge
at
the
northwest
corner
is
a
hole
dug
which
is
called
the
ice
spring
the
water
in
the
hole
smells
strong
of
sulphur
or
alkali
and
is
not
pleasant
tasting
but
under
the
water
which
is
over
a
foot
deep
there
is
as
clear
ice
as
i
ever
saw
and
good
tasting
some
of
the
brethren
had
broken
some
pieces
off
which
floated
and
i
ate
some
of
it
which
tasted
sweet
and
pleasant
the
ice
is
said
to
be
four
inches
thick
the
water
is
very
cold
although
the
weather
is
warm
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
than
the
spring
there
is
a
small
lake
or
spring
of
alkali
on
the
left
of
the
road
and
a
little
farther
still
another
lake
the
latter
is
more
pleasant
tasting
than
the
other
not
being
so
strong
of
sulphur
it
tastes
very
much
like
lye
water
mixed
with
salt
the
ground
around
these
lakes
is
white
with
alkali
or
saleratus
and
a
number
of
the
brethren
picked
up
their
pails
full
but
we
have
learned
that
it
ought
to
be
used
with
care
it
being
so
much
stronger
than
common
saleratus
if
the
same
quantity
is
used
it
makes
the
bread
quite
green
after
traveling
from
the
ice
spring
ten
and
a
quarter
miles
over
a
very
uneven
road
we
descended
a
very
steep
bluff
close
in
the
rear
of
one
of
the
missourian
companies
the
other
had
halted
a
few
miles
ahead
and
we
passed
by
them
while
winding
around
and
descending
from
this
bluff
we
came
in
sight
of
the
river
again
and
about
the
same
time
elder
kimball
picked
up
an
indian
arrow
point
made
of
flint
stone
and
nearly
perfect
it
was
almost
as
white
as
alabaster
at
we
tarried
a
little
south
from
the
road
and
formed
our
encampment
in
a
line
so
as
to
enclose
a
bend
in
the
river
having
traveled
seventeen
and
three
quarters
miles
without
halting
on
account
of
there
being
no
water
fit
for
cattle
to
drink
the
feed
here
is
very
good
and
plenty
of
willow
bushes
for
fuel
the
river
is
about
three
rods
wide
and
clearer
and
very
cool
the
last
five
or
six
miles
of
the
road
were
not
so
sandy
but
hard
and
good
traveling
one
of
the
missourian
companies
have
gone
on
but
the
other
camped
a
piece
down
the
river
at
the
fording
place
a
while
before
dark
when
the
brethren
were
fetching
up
their
teams
john
holman
while
bringing
up
president
young
best
horse
having
his
loaded
rifle
in
his
hand
the
horse
undertook
to
run
back
past
him
and
to
prevent
his
running
back
he
jammed
his
gun
at
him
the
cock
caught
in
his
clothes
the
gun
went
off
lodging
the
ball
in
the
animal
body
it
entered
a
little
forward
of
the
nigh
hind
leg
on
the
under
side
of
his
belly
making
quite
a
large
hole
the
horse
walked
to
camp
but
it
is
the
opinion
of
many
he
can
not
survive
long
he
appears
to
be
in
great
pain
the
sweat
falling
from
his
forehead
in
large
drops
president
young
is
evidently
filled
with
deep
sorrow
on
account
of
this
accident
but
attaches
no
blame
to
john
who
seems
grieved
very
much
the
brethren
generally
feel
sorrowful
this
being
the
second
horse
shot
by
accident
on
this
mission
friday
june
president
young
horse
is
dead
the
morning
is
fine
but
very
cool
at
twenty
minutes
to
seven
we
pursued
our
journey
fording
the
river
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
where
avc
left
the
road
last
night
we
found
it
still
nearly
three
feet
deep
and
the
current
very
swift
after
proceeding
a
half
a
mile
beyond
the
ford
we
crossed
a
stream
about
a
rod
wide
which
appears
to
come
from
the
northeast
and
empties
into
the
river
a
little
farther
up
half
a
mile
beyond
this
stream
we
turned
from
the
river
to
the
northwest
and
began
to
ascend
a
very
high
bluff
which
we
found
pretty
steep
and
over
a
mile
and
a
half
to
the
top
the
road
then
gradually
bends
around
towards
the
river
and
begins
to
descend
over
hill
and
hollow
and
at
four
and
a
quarter
miles
from
where
we
camped
strikes
the
river
again
and
continues
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
its
banks
here
would
be
a
pretty
good
place
to
camp
there
being
sufficient
grass
for
a
large
company
after
traveling
a
quarter
of
a
mile
near
the
river
we
encountered
another
high
sandy
ridge
the
road
again
winding
to
the
north
to
cross
it
the
descent
on
the
west
side
is
very
steep
and
unpleasant
we
strike
the
river
again
after
traveling
one
and
a
quarter
miles
from
where
we
last
left
it
but
it
is
the
opinion
of
many
that
by
fording
the
river
twice
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
we
could
save
a
mile
and
they
think
it
can
be
forded
colonel
rockwood
has
paid
particular
attention
to
the
place
and
reports
that
one
hour
labor
for
men
would
dig
down
the
foot
of
the
ridge
so
as
to
make
it
good
passing
and
save
rising
the
ridge
and
a
mile
travel
without
fording
the
river
after
leaving
the
west
foot
of
this
ridge
we
crossed
a
stream
about
feet
wide
and
again
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
the
same
only
about
six
feet
wide
on
examining
it
we
found
it
to
be
a
branch
of
the
river
running
around
a
piece
of
land
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
across
and
forming
a
island
the
last
crossing
was
soft
on
both
banks
the
high
sandy
bluffs
on
each
side
the
river
seem
to
approach
much
nearer
to
each
other
and
leave
only
a
small
strip
of
low
land
on
each
bank
at
passed
a
creek
two
feet
wide
and
halted
for
noon
having
traveled
eight
and
three
quarters
miles
the
wind
blowing
very
strong
from
the
northwest
and
making
it
cold
and
unpleasant
traveling
and
filling
the
wagons
with
dust
the
latitude
at
this
halt
by
elder
pratt
observation
is
at
we
proceeded
again
our
road
running
on
the
river
banks
two
miles
then
turning
to
the
northwest
and
ascending
a
succession
of
hills
one
after
another
for
three
miles
farther
winding
around
and
over
hill
and
valley
in
some
places
over
a
good
hard
road
and
in
other
places
over
rocks
and
broken
fragments
of
rock
making
it
severe
on
wagons
and
requiring
great
care
in
teamsters
about
a
half
mile
north
of
the
road
at
the
top
of
this
ridge
there
is
a
heavy
bank
of
snow
which
some
of
the
brethren
went
to
visit
and
amused
themselves
by
snowballing
each
other
brother
carrington
says
there
is
every
appearance
of
a
rich
lead
mine
in
the
same
place
he
having
examined
the
place
minutely
the
brethren
brought
some
snow
to
the
wagons
and
we
ate
some
of
it
which
tasted
refreshing
in
the
heat
of
the
day
after
arriving
on
the
top
of
these
ridges
we
began
to
descend
gradually
over
rolling
land
but
the
descent
is
not
nearly
equal
to
the
ascent
at
the
distance
of
seven
and
a
quarter
miles
from
noon
halt
we
crossed
a
narrow
wet
swamp
quite
difficult
for
teams
to
get
the
loads
over
without
help
and
one
and
a
quarter
miles
beyond
the
swamp
a
creek
a
foot
wide
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
still
another
one
two
feet
wide
these
all
unite
in
one
about
yards
to
the
left
below
the
middle
creek
and
then
appear
to
pass
under
a
snow
bank
which
at
present
forms
a
kind
of
bridge
over
the
creek
at
we
formed
our
encampment
on
the
north
banks
of
a
creek
about
five
feet
wide
having
traveled
this
afternoon
eleven
and
a
half
miles
and
during
the
day
twenty
and
a
quarter
this
creek
is
very
clear
and
cold
its
banks
are
well
lined
with
willows
and
about
a
mile
below
the
camp
there
is
a
grove
of
white
poplar
in
which
house
logs
may
be
obtained
sixteen
feet
long
and
a
foot
through
there
are
several
banks
of
snow
a
little
to
the
north
and
some
of
the
brethren
have
found
ice
four
or
five
inches
thick
and
brought
a
quantity
of
it
to
camp
on
the
banks
of
the
creek
there
are
some
groves
of
gooseberry
bushes
with
small
green
berries
on
them
there
are
also
some
strawberry
roots
and
flowers
and
a
little
white
clover
has
been
found
but
there
is
yet
no
appearance
of
the
great
abundance
of
such
things
as
travelers
have
represented
the
land
appears
somewhat
more
likely
to
yield
the
nearer
we
approach
to
the
mountains
but
all
calculations
for
farming
in
this
region
would
be
likely
to
fail
on
account
of
the
scarcity
of
timber
it
would
only
be
natural
to
suppose
that
the
nights
are
very
cold
here
while
so
much
snow
lies
around
it
requires
considerable
clothing
to
keep
comfortable
but
in
the
middle
of
the
day
it
is
equally
hot
some
of
the
brethren
have
traveled
up
the
banks
of
the
sweet
water
river
and
represent
it
as
tumbling
and
foaming
over
rocks
and
descending
very
rapidly
on
account
of
the
great
rise
of
the
ground
from
noon
halt
to
this
place
they
say
it
runs
within
a
mile
and
a
half
south
of
this
but
it
is
probable
it
is
only
a
branch
of
it
as
we
are
evidently
not
near
the
main
branch
yet
there
is
one
of
the
gentile
companies
camped
about
a
mile
below
making
the
third
company
we
have
passed
lately
and
it
is
the
intention
to
keep
ahead
of
them
and
have
the
advantage
of
the
good
feed
and
camping
grounds
saturday
june
morning
very
cold
and
considerable
ice
froze
in
the
water
pails
during
the
night
at
we
crossed
the
creek
and
pursued
our
journey
at
one
mile
we
passed
a
small
creek
which
rises
from
springs
a
little
south
of
the
road
where
there
is
a
small
grove
of
small
timber
elder
pratt
has
gone
ahead
with
the
barometer
to
try
to
find
the
culminating
point
or
highest
dividing
ridge
of
the
south
pass
as
we
are
evidently
at
the
east
foot
of
the
pass
fremont
represents
that
he
did
not
discover
the
highest
point
on
account
of
the
ascent
being
so
gradual
that
they
were
beyond
it
before
they
were
aware
of
it
although
in
company
with
a
man
who
has
traveled
it
back
and
forth
for
seventeen
years
at
two
and
miles
beyond
the
last
small
creek
we
crossed
the
branch
of
the
sweet
water
about
two
rods
wide
and
two
feet
deep
the
water
clear
and
cold
this
would
be
a
good
camp
ground
were
it
not
so
cold
as
it
must
be
from
the
fact
that
large
deep
banks
of
snow
are
now
lying
on
its
banks
both
above
and
below
the
road
where
the
snow
does
lie
there
is
good
grass
and
plenty
of
willow
groves
for
fuel
two
and
a
quarter
miles
beyond
this
branch
we
crossed
another
stream
about
eight
feet
wide
on
an
average
though
where
the
ford
is
it
is
nearly
three
rods
wide
and
two
feet
deep
this
water
is
also
very
clear
and
the
banks
well
lined
with
willows
and
grass
it
is
considered
a
superior
camping
ground
to
the
one
back
there
seem
to
be
a
great
many
antelope
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
which
is
about
all
the
game
to
be
seen
after
crossing
the
last
stream
we
climb
another
high
range
of
hills
over
a
good
road
gently
rolling
from
the
top
of
this
is
a
pleasant
view
of
the
surrounding
country
but
all
entirely
destitute
of
timber
except
on
and
at
the
base
of
the
mountains
many
miles
distance
from
the
road
we
have
also
a
good
view
of
table
rock
to
the
southwest
as
well
as
the
high
broken
white
capped
chain
of
the
wind
river
mountains
on
the
north
at
we
halted
on
the
main
branch
of
the
sweet
water
having
traveled
eleven
miles
the
river
here
is
about
three
rods
wide
three
feet
deep
and
current
very
swift
the
water
is
clear
and
cold
as
the
snow
which
lies
on
its
banks
in
places
six
or
eight
feet
deep
this
is
a
lovely
place
for
a
camp
ground
there
being
abundance
of
good
rich
grass
about
eight
inches
high
and
plenty
of
willows
for
fuel
some
of
the
boys
and
girls
amused
themselves
by
snowballing
each
other
on
one
of
the
large
snow
banks
a
few
rods
below
the
camp
soon
after
we
halted
eric
glines
came
up
having
left
the
brethren
at
the
upper
ferry
on
the
platte
river
on
wednesday
morning
he
camped
one
night
alone
the
other
nights
he
camped
with
missourians
he
does
not
assign
any
reason
why
he
followed
us
but
evidently
considering
to
repent
and
obey
council
than
to
continue
obstinate
and
rebellious
the
weather
is
now
warm
and
pleasant
and
but
little
wind
at
we
moved
onward
ascending
again
on
pretty
high
land
where
we
found
good
traveling
the
latitude
at
our
noon
halt
was
after
traveling
seven
miles
this
afternoon
we
arrived
on
a
level
spot
of
lower
land
and
some
grass
and
inasmuch
as
we
have
found
no
stream
as
laid
down
on
fremont
map
since
leaving
the
sweet
water
neither
is
there
much
appearance
of
any
for
some
miles
farther
the
wagons
halted
while
president
young
and
some
others
went
over
the
ridge
to
the
north
to
look
for
a
camp
ground
as
some
of
the
brethren
said
the
sweet
water
was
close
by
president
young
soon
sent
a
message
for
the
camp
to
proceed
leaving
the
road
and
taking
a
northwest
course
at
we
formed
our
encampment
on
the
banks
of
the
sweet
water
at
the
distance
of
a
little
over
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
road
having
traveled
this
afternoon
seven
and
a
quarter
miles
and
during
the
day
eighteen
and
a
quarter
this
is
a
good
place
to
camp
there
being
plenty
of
grass
and
willows
there
are
many
small
pebbles
of
hard
flint
rock
on
the
flat
land
a
little
back
and
some
almost
as
clear
as
glass
elders
kimball
pratt
and
some
others
are
some
miles
ahead
and
not
having
returned
at
dark
a
number
of
the
brethren
were
sent
to
meet
them
they
soon
returned
in
company
with
elder
kimball
who
reported
that
he
had
been
on
as
much
as
six
miles
to
where
the
head
waters
of
the
atlantic
divide
from
those
of
the
pacific
that
elder
pratt
was
camped
there
with
a
small
party
of
men
direct
from
oregon
and
bound
for
the
it
is
now
a
certainty
that
we
are
yet
two
miles
short
of
the
dividing
ridge
of
the
south
pass
by
the
road
this
ridge
divides
the
headwaters
of
the
atlantic
from
those
of
the
pacific
and
although
not
the
highest
land
we
have
traveled
over
it
may
with
propriety
be
said
to
be
the
summit
of
the
south
pass
the
wind
river
mountains
appear
very
high
from
this
place
but
on
the
south
there
is
very
little
appearance
of
mountains
table
rock
itself
appearing
but
a
little
elevated
sunday
june
morning
fine
but
cold
the
ox
teams
started
at
five
minutes
to
eight
and
the
remainder
shortly
after
we
soon
met
eight
of
the
oregon
men
on
their
way
back
having
over
twenty
horses
and
mules
with
them
mostly
laden
with
packs
of
robes
skins
etc
several
of
the
brethren
sent
letters
back
by
them
at
two
and
miles
arrived
at
the
dividing
ridge
where
elder
pratt
took
a
barometrical
observation
and
found
the
altitude
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
this
spot
is
miles
from
fort
john
and
is
supposed
to
divide
the
oregon
and
indian
territory
by
a
line
running
north
and
south
at
two
miles
farther
we
arrived
at
where
elder
pratt
camped
last
night
on
the
head
waters
of
the
green
river
and
although
the
stream
is
small
we
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
current
run
west
instead
of
east
the
face
of
the
country
west
looks
level
except
far
in
the
distance
where
a
range
of
mountains
peers
up
their
surface
white
with
snow
there
is
good
grass
here
but
no
timber
nor
in
fact
any
in
sight
except
on
the
mountains
since
leaving
the
pass
we
have
descended
considerably
winding
around
and
between
high
bluffs
or
hills
but
the
road
is
good
one
of
the
oregon
men
is
returning
with
us
today
and
then
intends
to
wait
for
the
next
companies
and
act
as
a
pilot
for
them
his
name
is
harris
and
he
appears
to
be
extensively
known
in
oregon
and
the
subject
of
much
dispute
on
account
of
his
having
found
out
a
new
route
to
oregon
much
south
of
the
old
one
he
appears
to
be
a
man
of
intelligence
and
well
acquainted
with
the
western
country
he
presented
a
file
of
the
oregon
papers
commencing
with
february
and
five
following
numbers
for
our
perusal
during
the
day
he
also
presented
a
number
of
the
california
star
published
at
yerba
buena
by
samuel
brannan
and
edited
by
jones
i
had
the
privilege
of
perusing
several
of
these
papers
during
the
day
but
found
little
interesting
news
harris
says
he
is
well
acquainted
with
the
bear
river
valley
and
the
region
around
the
salt
lake
from
his
description
which
is
very
discouraging
we
have
little
chance
to
hope
for
even
a
moderately
good
country
anywhere
in
those
regions
he
speaks
of
the
whole
region
as
being
sandy
and
destitute
of
timber
and
vegetation
except
the
wild
sage
he
gives
the
most
favorable
account
of
a
small
region
under
the
bear
river
mountains
called
the
cache
valley
where
they
have
practiced
caching
their
robes
to
hide
them
from
the
indians
he
represents
this
as
being
a
fine
place
to
winter
cattle
after
halting
some
time
we
proceeded
onward
and
crossed
the
stream
which
is
about
three
feet
wide
then
halted
on
its
banks
at
twelve
having
traveled
six
and
a
quarter
miles
the
day
warm
the
latitude
at
this
halt
was
at
we
started
again
and
proceeded
over
gently
rolling
land
and
good
hard
road
till
when
we
formed
our
encampment
on
the
west
banks
of
the
dry
sandy
having
traveled
this
afternoon
nine
miles
and
during
the
day
fifteen
and
a
quarter
the
country
west
for
many
miles
appears
destitute
of
timber
and
the
view
is
very
extensive
there
is
very
little
grass
to
be
seen
anywhere
and
not
much
near
this
creek
there
is
but
little
water
in
the
creek
at
first
sight
but
by
digging
and
tramping
on
the
quick
sand
sufficient
can
easily
be
obtained
to
supply
a
large
company
elder
kimball
has
been
on
the
road
nearly
two
miles
farther
but
discovered
no
chance
for
a
camping
ground
better
than
this
harris
has
described
a
valley
forty
miles
above
the
mouth
of
the
bear
river
and
thirty
miles
below
the
bear
springs
which
might
answer
our
purpose
pretty
well
if
the
report
is
true
it
is
about
thirty
miles
long
and
fifteen
miles
wide
and
tolerably
well
timbered
we
generally
feel
that
we
shall
know
best
by
going
ourselves
for
the
reports
of
travelers
are
so
contradictory
it
is
impossible
to
know
which
is
the
truth
without
going
to
prove
it
it
is
three
years
today
since
our
brethren
joseph
and
hyrum
were
taken
from
us
and
it
was
the
general
feeling
to
spend
the
day
in
fasting
and
prayer
but
the
gentile
companies
being
close
in
our
rear
and
feed
scarce
it
was
considered
necessary
to
keep
ahead
of
them
for
the
benefit
of
our
teams
but
many
minds
have
reverted
back
to
the
scenes
at
carthage
jail
and
it
is
a
gratification
that
we
have
so
far
prospered
in
our
endeavors
to
get
from
under
the
grasp
of
our
enemies
monday
june
morning
fine
but
cool
many
of
the
brethren
are
trading
with
harris
for
pants
jackets
shirts
made
of
buckskins
and
also
the
skins
themselves
he
sells
them
high
the
skins
at
and
a
pair
of
pants
etc
he
will
take
rifles
powder
lead
caps
or
calico
and
domestic
shirts
in
exchange
but
puts
his
own
price
on
both
sides
and
it
is
difficult
to
obtain
even
a
fair
trade
at
half
past
seven
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
harris
waiting
for
the
other
companies
after
traveling
six
miles
the
road
forks
one
continuing
a
west
course
the
other
taking
a
southwest
course
we
took
the
left
hand
road
which
leads
to
california
this
junction
of
the
road
is
miles
from
fort
john
we
then
continued
to
travel
over
a
desert
land
yielding
nothing
but
wild
sage
and
occasionally
a
grass
root
and
weeds
until
when
we
arrived
and
halted
for
noon
on
the
banks
of
the
little
sandy
having
traveled
thirteen
and
a
half
miles
without
signs
of
wood
water
or
feed
for
our
teams
this
stream
is
about
twenty
feet
wide
on
an
average
but
at
the
fording
place
over
three
rods
two
and
a
half
feet
deep
muddy
water
and
swift
current
there
is
not
much
grass
and
no
timber
except
willow
bushes
there
is
a
variety
of
roots
bearing
very
handsome
colored
flowers
one
of
the
brethren
has
picked
up
a
large
piece
of
petrified
wood
it
resembles
the
outside
layer
of
a
cottonwood
tree
next
to
the
bark
and
appears
to
have
rotted
and
broken
off
short
then
petrified
and
turned
to
a
solid
heavy
hard
flint
stone
but
retaining
its
original
shape
and
appearance
at
we
commenced
fording
the
river
and
found
it
in
no
way
difficult
until
a
number
of
the
wagons
had
gotten
over
and
the
banks
began
to
be
soft
and
muddy
several
of
the
latter
teams
required
help
at
all
were
safely
over
with
no
loss
except
two
tar
buckets
considered
to
be
of
no
worth
we
then
proceeded
on
expecting
to
go
about
eight
miles
farther
but
after
traveling
a
little
over
a
mile
we
were
met
by
elder
smith
who
introduced
us
to
bridger
of
bridger
fort
on
his
way
to
fort
john
in
company
with
two
of
his
men
bridger
being
informed
that
we
had
designed
to
call
at
his
place
to
make
some
inquiries
about
the
country
he
said
if
we
would
turn
off
the
road
here
and
camp
he
would
stay
with
us
till
morning
a
camping
place
being
selected
we
turned
off
from
the
road
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
formed
our
encampment
near
the
sandy
at
six
having
traveled
this
afternoon
one
and
miles
exclusive
of
allowance
for
leaving
the
road
and
during
the
day
fifteen
and
a
quarter
miles
we
have
pretty
good
feed
here
enough
to
fill
the
teams
well
a
while
after
we
camped
the
twelve
and
several
others
went
to
bridger
to
make
some
inquiries
concerning
our
future
route
the
country
etc
it
was
impossible
to
form
a
correct
idea
of
either
from
the
very
imperfect
and
irregular
way
he
gave
his
descriptions
but
the
general
items
are
in
substance
as
follows
we
will
find
better
grass
as
we
proceed
farther
on
his
business
is
to
fort
laramie
his
traders
have
gone
there
with
robes
skins
to
fill
a
contract
but
having
started
later
than
they
intended
the
men
at
laramie
have
taken
advantage
of
the
delay
and
he
is
going
to
see
to
the
business
himself
there
is
no
blacksmith
shop
at
his
fort
at
present
there
was
one
but
it
was
destroyed
there
have
been
nearly
a
hundred
wagons
gone
on
the
hastings
route
through
weber
fork
they
cross
the
blacks
fork
and
go
a
little
south
of
west
from
his
place
and
pass
below
the
mountains
which
cross
green
river
the
green
river
runs
over
an
extent
of
country
of
miles
it
is
impossible
for
wagons
to
follow
down
green
river
neither
can
it
be
followed
with
boats
some
have
gone
down
with
canoes
but
had
great
difficulty
getting
back
on
account
of
the
rapid
current
and
rough
channel
can
not
pass
the
mountains
close
to
the
river
even
with
horses
for
some
distance
beyond
this
chain
of
mountains
the
country
is
level
and
beyond
that
it
is
hard
black
rock
which
looks
as
if
it
were
glazed
when
the
sun
shines
on
it
and
so
hard
and
sharp
it
will
cut
a
horse
feet
to
pieces
when
we
get
below
the
mountains
the
green
river
falls
into
a
level
country
for
some
distance
after
which
it
winds
through
a
mountainous
country
perfectly
barren
to
the
gulf
of
california
from
bridger
fort
to
the
salt
lake
hastings
said
was
about
one
hundred
miles
he
has
been
through
fifty
times
but
can
form
no
correct
idea
of
the
distance
hastings
route
leaves
the
oregon
route
at
his
place
we
can
pass
the
mountains
farther
south
but
in
some
places
we
would
meet
with
heavy
bodies
of
timber
and
would
have
to
cut
our
way
through
in
the
bear
river
valley
there
is
oak
timber
sugar
trees
cottonwood
pine
and
maple
there
is
not
an
abundance
of
sugar
maple
but
plenty
of
as
splendid
pine
as
he
ever
saw
there
is
no
timber
on
the
utah
lake
only
on
the
streams
which
empty
into
it
in
the
outlet
of
the
utah
lake
which
runs
into
the
salt
lake
there
is
an
abundance
of
blue
grass
and
red
and
white
clover
the
outlet
of
the
utah
lake
does
not
form
a
large
river
neither
a
rapid
current
but
the
water
is
muddy
and
low
banks
some
of
his
men
have
been
around
the
salt
lake
in
canoes
they
went
out
hunting
and
had
their
horses
stolen
by
the
indians
they
then
went
around
the
lake
in
canoes
hunting
beaver
and
were
three
months
going
around
it
they
said
it
was
miles
around
it
the
utah
tribe
of
indians
inhabit
the
region
around
the
utah
lake
and
are
a
bad
people
if
they
catch
a
man
alone
they
are
sure
to
rob
and
abuse
him
if
they
do
kill
him
but
parties
of
men
are
in
no
danger
they
are
mostly
armed
with
guns
there
was
a
man
opened
a
farm
in
the
bear
river
valley
the
soil
is
good
and
likely
to
produce
corn
were
it
not
for
the
excessive
cold
nights
which
he
thinks
would
prevent
the
growth
of
corn
there
is
a
good
country
south
of
the
utah
lake
or
southeast
of
the
great
basin
there
are
three
large
rivers
which
enter
into
the
sevier
lake
unknown
to
travelers
there
is
also
a
splendid
range
of
country
on
the
north
side
of
the
california
mountains
calculated
to
produce
every
kind
of
grain
and
fruit
and
there
are
several
places
where
a
man
might
pass
from
it
over
the
mountains
to
the
california
settlements
in
one
day
there
is
a
vast
abundance
of
timber
and
plenty
of
coal
there
is
also
plenty
of
coal
in
this
region
near
the
mountains
north
of
the
california
mountains
there
is
walnut
oak
ash
hickory
and
various
kinds
of
good
timber
on
and
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
mountains
and
streams
southeast
of
the
great
basin
there
can
be
a
wagon
road
made
through
to
it
and
no
lack
of
water
the
great
desert
extends
from
the
salt
lake
to
the
gulf
of
california
which
is
perfectly
barren
he
supposes
it
to
have
been
an
arm
of
the
sea
the
three
rivers
before
mentioned
are
southwest
of
the
desert
there
is
a
tribe
of
indians
in
that
country
who
are
unknown
to
either
travelers
or
geographers
they
make
farms
and
raise
abundance
of
grain
of
various
kinds
he
can
buy
any
quantity
of
the
very
best
of
wheat
there
this
country
lies
southeast
of
the
salt
lake
there
is
one
mountain
in
that
region
and
the
country
adjoining
in
which
he
considers
if
ever
there
was
a
promised
land
that
must
be
it
there
is
a
kind
of
cedar
grows
on
it
which
bears
fruit
something
like
juniper
berries
of
a
yellow
color
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
plum
the
indians
grind
the
fruit
and
it
makes
the
best
kind
of
meal
he
could
easily
gather
a
hundred
bushels
off
one
tree
he
has
lived
on
this
fruit
and
used
to
pick
his
hat
full
in
a
very
short
time
there
are
a
great
many
little
streams
head
in
this
mountain
and
many
good
springs
it
is
about
twenty
days
travel
with
horses
from
the
salt
lake
but
the
country
to
it
is
bad
to
get
through
and
over
a
great
part
of
it
nothing
for
animals
to
subsist
on
he
supposes
there
might
be
access
to
it
from
texas
on
one
of
the
rivers
there
is
a
splendid
copper
mine
a
whole
mountain
of
it
it
also
abounds
in
gold
silver
and
has
a
good
quick
silver
mine
there
is
iron
coal
etc
the
land
is
good
the
soil
rich
all
the
valleys
abound
with
persimmons
and
grapes
which
will
make
the
best
kind
of
wines
he
never
saw
any
grapes
on
the
utah
lake
but
there
are
plenty
of
cherries
and
berries
of
several
kinds
he
thinks
the
utah
lake
is
the
best
country
in
the
vicinity
of
the
salt
lake
and
the
country
is
still
better
the
farther
south
we
go
until
we
meet
the
desert
which
is
upwards
of
miles
south
from
the
utah
lake
there
is
plenty
of
timber
on
all
the
streams
and
mountains
and
abundance
of
fish
in
the
streams
there
is
timber
all
around
the
utah
lake
and
plenty
of
good
grass
not
much
of
the
wild
sage
only
in
small
patches
wild
flax
grows
in
most
of
the
valleys
and
they
are
the
richest
lands
he
passed
through
that
country
a
year
ago
last
summer
in
the
month
of
july
and
they
generally
had
one
or
two
showers
every
day
sometimes
a
very
heavy
thunder
shower
but
not
accompanied
by
strong
wind
by
following
under
the
mountain
south
of
the
utah
lake
we
find
another
river
which
enters
into
another
lake
about
fifty
miles
south
of
the
utah
lake
we
shall
find
plenty
of
water
from
here
to
bridger
fort
except
after
we
cross
green
river
and
travel
five
miles
beyond
it
where
we
shall
have
to
travel
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
without
water
but
there
is
plenty
of
grass
after
crossing
green
river
we
follow
down
it
four
or
five
miles
to
the
old
station
then
cross
over
to
a
stream
which
heads
in
the
mountains
west
the
station
is
more
than
half
way
from
here
to
his
place
we
shall
have
no
streams
to
ferry
between
here
and
the
fort
except
green
river
the
indians
south
of
the
utah
lake
and
this
side
the
desert
raise
corn
wheat
and
other
kinds
of
grain
and
produce
in
abundance
the
utah
abound
more
on
the
west
of
the
mountains
near
the
salt
lake
than
on
the
east
side
ten
to
one
but
we
have
no
need
to
fear
them
for
we
can
drive
the
whole
of
them
in
hours
but
he
would
not
kill
them
he
would
make
slaves
of
them
the
indians
south
of
the
utah
lake
raise
as
good
corn
wheat
and
pumpkins
as
were
ever
raised
in
old
kentucky
he
knows
of
a
lead
mine
between
the
mountains
and
laramie
on
a
timbered
creek
near
the
horseshoe
creek
he
has
found
lead
there
and
thinks
there
is
considerable
silver
in
it
it
can
be
found
in
a
cave
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
not
far
from
the
road
such
was
the
information
we
obtained
from
bridger
but
we
shall
know
more
about
things
and
have
a
better
understanding
when
we
have
seen
the
country
ourselves
supper
had
been
provided
for
bridger
and
his
men
and
the
latter
having
eaten
the
council
dismissed
bridger
going
with
president
young
to
supper
the
remainder
retiring
to
their
wagons
conversing
over
the
subject
touched
upon
the
evening
was
very
fine
but
mosquitoes
numerous
tuesday
june
morning
very
pleasant
till
the
sun
got
up
a
little
then
it
was
very
hot
we
started
at
and
traveled
over
very
good
roads
through
barren
land
till
then
halted
for
noon
on
the
banks
of
the
big
sandy
having
traveled
six
and
miles
the
second
division
have
passed
over
the
river
but
the
first
division
halted
on
the
north
side
this
stream
appears
to
be
about
seven
rods
wide
at
this
place
and
about
two
feet
deep
in
the
channel
but
it
is
not
generally
so
wide
but
deeper
there
is
some
timber
on
its
banks
and
plenty
of
grass
in
places
for
teams
at
we
again
proceeded
president
young
and
some
others
going
ahead
in
the
cutter
wagon
to
look
out
a
camp
ground
for
the
night
our
course
still
lies
about
southwest
the
road
generally
good
over
gently
rolling
hard
sandy
land
and
in
some
places
the
surface
is
covered
with
loose
fragments
of
hard
rock
after
traveling
nine
and
a
half
miles
president
young
rode
up
and
reported
that
we
would
have
to
go
at
least
six
miles
farther
before
we
could
get
feed
it
was
then
a
quarter
after
six
but
the
teamsters
spurred
up
in
order
to
get
through
most
of
the
road
after
this
for
four
miles
was
very
hilly
and
uneven
and
in
places
the
loose
fragments
of
rocks
made
it
very
bad
traveling
but
many
were
thrown
from
the
road
by
the
spare
men
the
weather
grew
cooler
towards
evening
some
large
clouds
rising
in
the
west
which
favored
the
teams
considerably
at
we
found
ourselves
on
the
lowlands
on
the
banks
of
the
river
again
and
formed
our
encampment
having
traveled
since
noon
seventeen
miles
and
during
the
day
and
which
is
the
greatest
day
journey
we
have
made
since
leaving
winter
quarters
the
camp
was
formed
by
moonlight
there
seems
to
be
plenty
of
feed
for
teams
but
no
wood
for
fuel
many
of
the
brethren
have
gone
down
sick
within
the
past
three
days
and
a
number
more
this
evening
they
generally
begin
with
headache
succeeded
by
violent
fever
and
some
go
delirious
for
a
while
brother
fowler
was
seized
this
afternoon
and
this
evening
is
raving
it
is
supposed
by
some
that
this
sickness
is
caused
by
the
use
of
the
mineral
saleratus
or
alkali
picked
up
on
the
lakes
and
surface
of
the
land
and
it
is
considered
poisonous
some
consider
also
that
we
inhale
the
effluvium
arising
from
it
which
has
the
like
effect
it
appears
to
be
an
article
which
ought
to
be
used
with
great
care
if
used
at
all
there
has
been
no
case
considered
dangerous
yet
nor
any
of
long
duration
wednesday
june
morning
hot
we
resumed
our
journey
at
several
others
of
the
brethren
being
reported
sick
president
young
kimball
and
others
rode
ahead
again
we
found
the
roads
very
good
but
sandy
and
filling
the
wagons
with
dust
at
we
arrived
on
the
banks
of
green
river
having
traveled
eight
miles
and
formed
our
encampment
in
a
line
under
the
shade
of
the
cottonwood
timber
this
river
is
about
sixteen
to
eighteen
rods
wide
and
altogether
too
deep
to
be
forded
its
banks
are
well
lined
with
cottonwood
but
none
large
enough
to
make
a
canoe
there
are
also
many
patches
of
wild
apple
trees
and
rose
bushes
abound
bearing
pretty
roses
this
river
is
miles
from
fort
john
or
laramie
there
is
a
narrow
strip
of
land
which
might
answer
for
farming
on
each
bank
of
the
river
the
grass
grows
good
and
plentiful
but
still
not
so
much
as
has
been
represented
after
dinner
the
brethren
commenced
making
two
rafts
one
for
each
division
and
a
while
afterwards
elder

brannan
arrived
having
come
from

brought
with
them
several
files
of
the
california
star
they
had
eleven
deaths
on
board
their
ship
during
their
voyage
over
the

well
raising

a
storm
blew
up
from
the
west
and
although
we
had
no
rain
we
had
tremendous
wind
the
first
division
finished
their
raft
before
dark
there
is
a
slough
a
little
down
the
river
where
some
of
the
brethren
have
caught
some
very
nice
fish
but
the
mosquitoes
are
so
very
troublesome
it
is
difficult
abiding
out
of
doors
july
thursday
july
this
morning
found
myself
laboring
under
a
severe
attack
of
the
fever
accompanied
with
violent
aching
in
my
head
and
limbs
the
brethren
commenced
ferrying
but
got
only
fourteen
wagons
over
on
account
of
the
very
high
wind
friday
july
the
day
was
more
pleasant
and
the
ferrying
continued
more
rapidly
i
got
over
the
river
before
noon
but
remained
very
sick
afternoon
the
twelve
had
a
council
and
decided
to
send
three
or
four
men
back
to
serve
as
guides
to
the
next
company
saturday
july
the
morning
more
unfavorable
the
brethren
got
the
last
wagon
over
before
noon
no
accident
having
happened
and
about
the
time
they
finished
it
commenced
raining
accompanied
by
thunder
and
wind
it
was
concluded
for
some
of
the
brethren
to
go
on
and
look
out
a
camp
ground
a
few
miles
ahead
so
as
to
shorten
the
distance
of
the
next
travel
the
brethren
returned
about
noon
and
gave
orders
to
harness
up
and
proceed
and
at
we
moved
forward
and
went
on
three
miles
then
formed
encampment
in
the
midst
of
an
army
of
mosquitoes
these
insects
are
more
numerous
here
than
i
ever
saw
them
anywhere
everything
was
covered
with
them
making
the
teams
restive
in
the
wagons
there
is
plenty
of
grass
for
teams
and
it
is
the
intention
to
tarry
here
till
monday
morning
at
night
president
young
gave
the
brethren
some
instructions
about
trading
at
fort
bridger
and
advised
them
to
be
wise
etc
five
men
were
selected
to
go
back
and
meet
the
next
company
phineas
young
george
woodard
aaron
farr
eric
glines
and
rodney
badger
they
are
to
take
the
cutter
wagon
instead
of
each
taking
a
horse
which
can
not
be
spared
by
the
camp
sunday
july
the
morning
fine
and
warm
the
five
brethren
have
started
back
to
meet
the
other
company
president
young
kimball
and
others
went
back
with
them
to
ferry
them
over
green
river
some
of
the
brethren
assembled
for
meeting
in
the
circle
at
the
brethren
returned
from
the
ferry
accompanied
by
twelve
of
the
pueblo
brethren
from
the
army
they
have
got
their
discharge
and
by
riding
hard
overtaken
us
they
feel
well
and
on
arriving
in
camp
gave
three
cheers
after
which
president
young
moved
that
we
give
glory
to
god
which
was
done
by
hosannas
william
walker
was
with
them
but
has
gone
back
with
the
five
brethren
to
meet
his
wife
the
spot
where
we
are
now
camped
is
opposite
to
the
junction
of
the
big
sandy
and
green
river
on
the
other
side
the
river
there
is
a
range
of
singular
sandy
buttes
perfectly
destitute
of
vegetation
and
on
the
sides
can
be
seen
from
here
two
caves
which
are
probably
inhabited
by
wild
bears
the
view
is
pleasant
and
interesting
during
the
afternoon
one
of
brother
crow
oxen
was
found
to
be
poisoned
through
eating
some
kind
of
a
weed
and
was
much
swollen
i
understand
it
was
dead
when
they
found
it
monday
july
at
eight
we
pursued
our
journey
many
of
the
brethren
still
being
sick
though
generally
improving
after
traveling
three
and
a
half
miles
on
the
bank
of
the
river
the
road
then
leaves
it
bending
westward
we
have
now
a
very
pleasant
view
of
the
bear
river
mountains
far
to
the
southwest
their
summits
capped
with
snow
we
found
the
land
somewhat
rolling
destitute
of
grass
and
several
very
steep
places
of
descent
at
we
arrived
on
the
banks
of
blacks
fork
and
formed
our
encampment
having
traveled
twenty
miles
the
last
sixteen
and
a
half
without
sight
of
water
this
stream
is
about
six
rods
wide
very
swift
current
but
not
deep
the
bottoms
on
each
side
are
very
pleasant
but
not
much
grass
for
teams
there
is
one
place
in
the
road
where
we
might
have
saved
a
crook
of
nearly
a
mile
by
digging
down
bank
which
would
probably
have
detained
us
about
twenty
minutes
but
it
was
not
discovered
till
most
of
the
wagons
had
passed
over
tuesday
july
morning
very
pleasant
we
started
on
our
journey
at
and
after
traveling
three
and
miles
crossed
hams
fork
a
rapid
stream
about
three
rods
wide
and
two
feet
deep
and
this
would
be
a
good
place
to
camp
there
being
an
abundance
of
high
bunch
grass
on
the
banks
one
and
a
half
miles
farther
we
crossed
blacks
fork
which
appears
to
be
about
eight
rods
wide
and
two
and
a
half
feet
deep
but
little
grass
near
it
we
then
leave
the
river
and
wind
over
uneven
road
with
many
pitches
caused
by
heavy
rains
washing
the
land
which
is
generally
barren
after
traveling
eleven
miles
beyond
the
last
stream
crossed
a
small
creek
about
two
feet
wide
but
no
grass
at
four
we
crossed
back
over
blacks
fork
and
formed
our
encampment
on
its
banks
having
traveled
eighteen
and
a
quarter
miles
at
this
place
there
is
a
fine
specimen
of
the
wild
flax
which
grows
all
around
it
is
considered
equal
to
any
cultivated
bears
a
delicate
blue
flower
there
is
also
an
abundance
of
the
rich
bunch
grass
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
river
back
and
many
wild
currants
the
prairies
are
lined
with
beautiful
flowers
of
various
colors
chiefly
blue
red
and
yellow
which
have
a
rich
appearance
and
would
serve
to
adorn
and
beautify
an
eastern
flower
garden
wednesday
july
this
morning
we
proceeded
at
and
after
traveling
two
and
a
half
miles
forded
black
fork
once
more
here
also
is
abundance
of
good
grass
wild
flax
and
handsome
flowers
after
traveling
two
and
miles
farther
forded
a
stream
about
two
rods
wide
and
two
feet
deep
very
swift
current
also
lined
on
its
banks
with
bunch
grass
at
twelve
we
halted
for
noon
on
the
banks
of
the
last
stream
having
traveled
nine
miles
over
pretty
rough
road
the
day
very
windy
and
filling
the
wagons
with
dust
some
of
the
wagons
have
gone
on
expecting
to
reach
bridger
fort
before
they
halt
at
we
moved
forward
and
found
the
road
more
even
though
in
many
places
rendered
bad
by
the
cobble
stones
after
traveling
seven
and
a
half
miles
we
arrived
opposite
to
nine
indian
lodges
erected
on
the
south
of
the
road
here
we
halted
a
while
and
found
tim
goodale
here
one
of
the
trappers
who
passed
us
at
the
platte
ferry
there
are
not
many
indians
here
but
they
appear
to
have
a
great
many
handsome
ponies
we
then
continued
on
and
after
fording
four
creeks
on
an
average
about
a
rod
wide
we
arrived
at
fort
bridger
which
is
proved
by
the
roadometer
to
be
miles
from
fort
john
we
went
half
a
mile
beyond
the
fort
and
formed
our
encampment
after
crossing
three
more
creeks
having
traveled
this
afternoon
eight
and
miles
and
during
the
day
seventeen
and
the
grass
is
very
plentiful
in
this
neighborhood
and
much
higher
than
we
have
generally
seen
it
the
whole
region
seems
filled
with
rapid
streams
all
bending
their
way
to
the
principal
fork
they
doubtless
originate
from
the
melting
of
the
snow
on
the
mountains
and
roar
down
their
cobbly
beds
till
they
join
fork
bridger
fort
is
composed
of
two
double
log
houses
about
forty
feet
long
each
and
joined
by
a
pen
for
horses
about
ten
feet
high
constructed
by
placing
poles
upright
in
the
ground
close
together
which
is
all
the
appearance
of
a
fort
in
sight
there
are
several
indian
lodges
close
by
and
a
full
crop
of
young
children
playing
around
the
door
these
indians
are
said
to
be
of
the
snake
tribe
the
utahs
inhabiting
beyond
the
mountains
the
latitude
of
fort
bridget
is
and
its
height
above
the
level
of
the
sea
according
to
elder
pratt
observations
is
feet
it
is
doubtless
a
very
cold
region
and
little
calculated
for
farming
purposes
to
the
west
is
a
pretty
high
mountain
which
appears
well
covered
with
timber
the
country
all
around
looks
bleak
and
cold
thursday
july
morning
fine
but
high
wind
it
is
concluded
to
stay
a
day
here
to
set
some
wagon
tires
etc
many
have
gone
to
trade
their
rifles
and
some
clothing
for
buckskins
egan
traded
two
rifles
and
got
twenty
pretty
good
skins
for
them
the
day
continued
warm
with
high
wind
evening
there
was
a
council
and
some
complaints
listened
to
from
george
mills
against
andrew
gibbons
it
was
decided
for
thomas
williams
and
brannan
to
return
from
here
and
meet
captain
brown
company
from
pueblo
inasmuch
as
the
brethren
have
not
received
their
discharge
nor
their
paw
from
the
united
states
brother
brannan
goes
to
tender
his
services
as
pilot
to
conduct
a
company
of
fifteen
or
twenty
to
san
francisco
if
they
feel
disposed
to
go
there
and
try
to
get
their
pay
williams
came
clothed
with
authority
to
arrest
tim
goodale
or
one
of
his
men
for
stealing
a
horse
at
pueblo
but
he
can
get
no
encouragement
from
president
young
to
make
the
attempt
friday
july
we
started
at
eight
the
brethren
who
go
back
bidding
good
bye
to
the
camp
and
proceeding
on
their
back
journey
while
we
moved
westward
over
pretty
rough
roads
after
traveling
six
and
a
quarter
miles
we
arrived
at
the
springs
and
halted
a
while
to
rest
our
teams
we
then
proceeded
on
of
a
mile
and
began
to
ascend
a
long
steep
hill
near
the
top
of
which
and
eight
miles
from
fort
bridger
elder
pratt
took
an
observation
and
found
the
latitude
arriving
on
the
top
we
found
the
table
tolerably
level
for
several
miles
then
began
to
descend
to
the
bottom
again
the
descent
from
this
hill
is
the
steepest
and
most
difficult
we
have
ever
met
with
being
long
and
almost
perpendicular
at
three
we
crossed
the
muddy
fork
a
stream
about
twelve
feet
wide
and
formed
our
encampment
on
the
west
bank
having
traveled
since
the
halt
six
and
miles
and
during
the
day
thirteen
here
is
plenty
of
tall
bunch
grass
and
a
pretty
good
chance
for
our
teams
the
day
has
been
windy
warm
and
dusty
saturday
july
started
this
morning
at
eight
weather
warm
with
tolerably
high
wind
after
traveling
three
and
a
half
miles
we
passed
a
small
copperas
spring
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
road
the
water
is
very
clear
but
tastes
very
strong
of
copperas
and
alum
and
has
a
somewhat
singular
effect
on
the
mouth
it
runs
a
little
distance
over
the
red
sand
which
abounds
in
this
region
and
where
it
is
saturated
with
water
almost
looks
like
blood
at
a
little
distance
after
passing
this
spring
the
road
winds
around
the
foot
of
mountains
gradually
ascending
for
some
distance
till
finally
arriving
on
the
summit
of
a
high
ridge
here
elder
pratt
took
a
barometrical
observation
and
found
the
height
to
be
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
on
arriving
at
the
west
side
of
the
ridge
two
and
a
half
miles
from
the
last
mentioned
spring
we
found
a
very
steep
rough
place
to
descend
and
found
it
necessary
to
halt
and
fix
the
road
about
half
way
down
there
is
a
place
over
huge
rocks
leaving
barely
enough
room
for
a
wagon
to
get
down
but
by
labor
it
was
soon
made
passable
a
little
farther
the
brethren
had
to
dig
a
place
considerably
to
make
a
pass
between
the
mountains
president
young
and
kimball
labored
hard
with
a
number
of
others
and
in
about
a
half
an
hour
made
a
good
road
at
twenty
miles
from
fort
bridger
passed
another
spring
and
a
little
farther
after
arriving
on
the
bottom
land
the
road
turns
nearly
south
through
a
beautiful
low
bottom
filled
with
grass
at
we
halted
for
noon
having
traveled
nine
miles
latitude
after
halting
an
hour
and
a
half
we
proceeded
again
and
after
traveling
three
and
a
half
miles
began
to
ascend
the
dividing
ridge
between
the
colorado
waters
and
the
great
basin
this
mountain
is
very
high
and
the
ascent
steep
rendering
it
necessary
to
make
a
crooked
road
to
gain
the
summit
the
height
is
feet
according
to
elder
observations
the
surface
at
the
top
is
narrow
here
three
bears
were
seen
to
run
over
a
still
higher
mountain
on
the
left
the
descent
was
very
steep
having
to
lock
the
wagons
for
half
a
mile
we
then
descend
and
travel
on
the
bottom
a
few
miles
between
high
rugged
mountains
till
the
road
seems
suddenly
to
be
shut
up
by
a
high
mountain
ahead
the
road
here
turns
suddenly
to
the
left
and
goes
east
about
yards
then
winds
again
southwest
after
ascending
and
descending
another
high
ridge
we
crossed
a
small
creek
about
ten
feet
wide
and
at
formed
our
encampment
on
the
southwest
banks
having
traveled
this
afternoon
nine
miles
and
during
the
day
eighteen
over
the
most
mountainous
course
we
have
yet
seen
after
camping
mr
miles
goodyear
came
into
camp
he
is
the
man
who
is
making
a
farm
in
the
bear
river
valley
he
says
it
is
yet
miles
to
his
place
although
we
are
now
within
two
miles
of
bear
river
his
report
of
the
valley
is
more
favorable
than
some
we
have
heard
but
we
have
an
idea
he
is
anxious
to
have
us
make
a
road
to
his
place
through
selfish
motives
elder
pratt
has
found
a
beautiful
spring
of
clear
sweet
cold
water
about
a
hundred
yards
southwest
from
the
camp
water
excellent
sunday
july
morning
fine
with
ice
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
on
the
water
pails
walked
on
the
mountain
east
with
president
young
and
kimball
from
whence
we
had
a
pleasing
view
of
the
surrounding
valley
which
is
about
ten
miles
wide
abundance
of
timber
on
the
mountains
south
and
southwest
and
beyond
that
plenty
of
snow
after
having
prayers
we
again
descended
and
at
the
foot
discovered
a
very
strong
sulphur
spring
the
surface
of
the
water
is
covered
with
flour
of
sulphur
and
where
it
oozes
from
the
rocks
is
perfectly
black
the
water
in
the
creek
shows
sulphur
very
clearly
and
smells
bad
during
the
day
some
of
the
brethren
discovered
an
oil
spring
about
a
mile
south
the
substance
which
rises
out
of
the
ground
resembles
tar
and
is
very
oily
some
have
oiled
their
gun
stocks
with
it
and
oiled
their
shoes
others
have
gone
to
fill
their
tar
buckets
and
are
sanguine
it
will
answer
well
to
grease
wagons
it
is
somewhat
singular
to
find
such
a
great
contrast
of
substances
within
so
short
a
distance
here
is
pure
water
sulphur
and
oily
tar
within
a
mile
of
each
other
and
matter
of
curiosity
all
around
for
the
contemplation
of
the
curious
porter
brother
little
and
others
have
been
out
with
goodyear
to
view
the
route
he
wishes
us
to
take
they
represent
it
as
being
bad
enough
but
we
are
satisfied
it
leads
too
far
out
of
our
course
to
be
tempted
to
try
it
there
are
some
in
camp
who
are
getting
discouraged
about
the
looks
of
the
country
but
thinking
minds
are
not
much
disappointed
and
we
have
no
doubt
of
finding
a
place
where
the
saints
can
live
which
is
all
we
ought
to
ask
or
expect
it
is
evident
the
country
grows
better
as
we
proceed
west
and
vegetation
is
more
plentiful
and
looks
richer
after
dark
a
meeting
was
called
to
decide
which
of
the
two
roads
we
shall
take
from
here
it
was
voted
to
take
the
right
hand
or
northern
road
but
the
private
feelings
of
all
the
twelve
were
that
the
other
would
be
better
but
such
matters
are
left
to
the
choice
of
the
camp
so
that
none
may
have
room
to
murmur
at
the
twelve
hereafter
monday
july
morning
cloudy
and
cool
we
pursued
our
journey
at
at
one
and
a
quarter
miles
rose
a
very
steep
low
hill
narrow
but
very
steep
on
both
sides
one
half
a
mile
farther
crossed
the
bear
river
a
very
rapid
stream
about
six
rods
wide
and
two
feet
deep
bottom
full
of
large
cobble
stones
water
clear
banks
lined
with
willows
and
a
little
timber
good
grass
many
strawberry
vines
and
the
soil
looks
pretty
good
about
a
half
a
mile
beyond
the
ford
proceeded
over
another
ridge
and
again
descended
into
and
traveled
up
a
beautiful
narrow
bottom
covered
with
grass
and
fertile
but
no
timber
four
and
of
a
mile
beyond
bear
river
passed
a
small
spring
of
good
clear
cold
water
at
halted
for
noon
in
the
same
narrow
bottom
near
a
ridge
of
high
rough
rocks
to
the
right
having
traveled
nine
and
miles
there
is
scarcely
any
wagon
track
to
be
seen
only
a
few
wagons
of
hasting
company
having
come
this
route
the
balance
went
the
other
road
and
many
of
them
perished
in
the
snow
it
being
late
in
the
season
and
much
time
was
lost
quarreling
who
would
improve
the
roads
etc
there
is
a
creek
of
clear
water
close
by
deep
but
scarcely
any
current
president
young
was
taken
very
sick
awhile
before
we
halted
after
resting
two
hours
the
camp
moved
on
again
except
president
young
and
kimball
wagons
who
concluded
to
remain
there
today
on
account
of
the
president
sickness
after
traveling
one
and
a
half
miles
we
crossed
the
creek
at
the
foot
of
a
high
mountain
and
a
little
farther
crossed
back
again
a
mile
farther
began
to
ascend
a
long
steep
hill
narrow
on
the
summit
and
steep
descent
we
then
wound
around
between
high
hills
till
arriving
again
on
a
narrow
rich
bottom
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
we
crossed
last
there
is
a
spring
of
very
good
cold
water
and
in
fact
there
are
many
good
springs
all
along
the
road
at
six
we
formed
our
encampment
near
a
very
small
creek
and
a
good
spring
having
traveled
this
afternoon
six
and
miles
and
during
the
day
sixteen
and
a
half
there
is
an
abundance
of
grass
here
and
the
country
appears
to
grow
still
richer
as
we
proceed
west
but
very
mountainous
there
are
many
antelope
on
these
mountains
and
the
country
is
lovely
enough
but
destitute
of
timber
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
west
from
the
camp
is
a
cave
in
the
rock
about
thirty
feet
long
fifteen
feet
wide
and
from
four
to
six
feet
high
there
are
many
martins
at
the
entrance
and
on
observing
closely
can
be
seen
myriads
of
small
bugs
it
is
supposed
from
appearances
that
there
is
some
property
cached
in
the
cave
soon
after
we
camped
we
had
a
light
shower
accompanied
by
thunder
this
country
evidently
lacks
rain
even
the
grass
appears
parched
tuesday
july
awhile
before
noon
elder
kimball
and
howard
egan
arrived
from
the
company
back
a
meeting
was
called
but
suddenly
dispersed
by
a
thunder
shower
after
the
rain
ceased
elder
kimball
proposed
that
a
company
start
from
the
camp
with
elder
pratt
to
proceed
to
the
weber
river
canyon
and
ascertain
if
we
can
pass
through
safely
if
not
to
try
and
find
a
pass
over
the
mountains
he
reported
that
president
young
is
a
little
better
this
morning
but
last
evening
was
insensible
and
raving
colonel
rockwood
is
also
very
sick
and
quite
deranged
a
company
of
wagons
mostly
ox
teams
started
on
soon
after
dinner
in
company
with
elder
pratt
and
soon
after
elders
kimball
and
egan
returned
to
the
back
company
the
day
has
been
very
hot
and
sultry
and
mosquitoes
are
very
troublesome
wednesday
july
the
day
has
been
very
hot
with
occasionally
a
light
breeze
several
of
the
brethren
have
been
out
hunting
and
brought
in
several
antelope
which
appear
to
abound
in
this
region
brothers
woodruff
and
barnabas
adams
went
back
to
the
other
wagons
this
morning
they
returned
at
night
and
reported
that
president
young
is
considerably
better
but
brother
rockwood
remains
very
sick
there
are
one
or
two
new
cases
of
sickness
in
our
camp
mostly
with
fever
which
is
very
severe
on
the
first
attack
generally
rendering
its
victims
delirious
for
some
hours
and
then
leaving
them
in
a
languid
weakly
condition
it
appears
that
a
good
dose
of
pills
or
medicine
is
good
to
break
the
fever
the
patient
then
needs
some
kind
of
stimulant
to
brace
his
nerves
and
guard
him
against
another
attack
i
am
satisfied
that
diluted
spirits
is
good
in
this
disease
after
breaking
up
the
fever
at
night
had
a
light
shower
the
following

at
twelve
president
young
kimball
and
all
the
rear
wagons
arrived
eight
in
number
the
president
is
much
better
brother
rockwood
is
considerably
better
orders
were
given
for
this
company
to
harness
up
and
during
the
time
till
we
started
onward
at
one
we
had
a
very
refreshing
shower
after
traveling
two
miles
we
passed
another
spring
of
good
water
at
the
foot
of
a
high
hill
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
road
at
three
we
formed
our
encampment
at
the
foot
of
some
high
red
bluffs
having
traveled
four
and
a
half
miles
and
enjoyed
two
more
pleasant
showers
feed
here
good
and
a
beautiful
spring
of
good
clear
cold
water
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
road
the
evening
fine
and
pleasant
friday
july
this
morning
we
have
had
two
pleasant
showers
accompanied
by
pretty
loud
thunder
at
we
proceeded
onward
passing
through
a
narrow
ravine
between
very
high
mountains
after
traveling
one
and
a
quarter
miles
passed
a
deep
ravine
where
most
of
the
teams
had
to
double
to
get
up
mile
farther
crossed
the
creek
and
found
the
crossing
place
very
bad
harvey
pierce
broke
his
wagon
reach
and
bolster
the
wagon
had
to
be
unloaded
but
with
little
delay
was
soon
repaired
during
which
time
a
number
of
the
brethren
fixed
a
new
place
to
cross
the
creek
after
passing
this
place
following
the
course
of
the
creek
the
mountains
seem
to
increase
in
height
and
come
so
near
together
in
some
places
as
to
leave
merely
room
enough
for
a
crooked
road
at
half
past
twelve
we
halted
to
feed
having
traveled
six
and
miles
and
are
yet
surrounded
by
high
mountains
as
we
halted
rockwell
came
up
from
elder
pratt
company
he
reports
that
it
is
about
or
thirty
miles
to
the
canyon
they
have
found
the
road
leading
over
the
mountains
to
avoid
the
canyon
and
expect
to
be
on
top
today
at
noon
the
day
is
pleasant
with
a
nice
breeze
grass
plentiful
and
pretty
high
but
no
timber
yet
except
small
cedar
on
the
sides
of
the
mountains
numerous
springs
of
clear
water
all
along
the
base
of
the
mountains
during
the
halt
two
of
the
brethren
went
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
on
the
north
of
the
camp
they
looked
like
babes
in
size
at
we
proceeded
onward
and
found
the
pass
between
the
mountains
growing
narrower
until
it
seemed
strange
that
a
road
could
ever
have
been
made
through
we
crossed
creek
a
number
of
times
and
in
several
places
found
the
crossing
difficult
after
proceeding
a
few
miles
we
saw
patches
of
oak
shrubbery
though
small
in
size
in
the
same
place
and
for
several
miles
there
are
many
patches
or
groves
of
the
wild
currant
hop
vines
alder
and
black
birch
willows
are
abundant
and
high
the
currants
are
yet
green
and
taste
most
like
a
gooseberry
thick
rind
and
rather
bitter
the
hops
are
in
blossom
and
seem
likely
to
yield
a
good
crop
the
which
are
not
very
plentiful
are
in
bloom
in
some
places
we
had
to
pass
close
to
the
foot
of
high
perpendicular
red
mountains
of
rock
supposed
to
be
from
six
hundred
to
a
thousand
feet
high
at
a
quarter
to
seven
we
formed
our
encampment
having
traveled
this
afternoon
nine
and
a
half
miles
and
during
the
day
sixteen
and
a
quarter
we
are
yet
enclosed
by
high
mountains
on
each
side
and
this
is
the
first
good
camping
place
we
have
seen
since
noon
not
for
lack
of
grass
or
water
but
on
account
of
the
narrow
gap
between
the
mountains
grass
is
pretty
plentiful
most
of
the
distance
and
seems
to
grow
higher
the
farther
we
go
west
at
this
place
the
grass
is
about
six
feet
high
and
on
the
creek
eight
or
ten
feet
high
there
is
one
kind
of
grass
which
bears
a
head
almost
like
wheat
and
grows
pretty
high
some
of
it
six
feet
there
is
a
very
singular
echo
in
this
ravine
the
rattling
of
wagons
resembles
carpenters
hammering
at
boards
inside
the
highest
rocks
the
report
of
a
rifle
resembles
a
sharp
crack
of
thunder
and
echoes
from
rock
to
rock
for
some
time
the
lowing
of
cattle
and
braying
of
mules
seem
to
be
answered
beyond
the
mountains
music
especially
brass
instruments
have
a
very
pleasing
effect
and
resemble
a
person
standing
inside
the
rock
imitating
every
note
the
echo
the
high
rocks
on
the
north
high
mountains
on
the
south
with
the
narrow
ravine
for
a
road
form
a
scenery
at
once
romantic
and
more
interesting
than
i
have
ever
witnessed
soon
after
we
camped
i
walked
up
the
highest
mountain
on
the
south
the
ascent
is
so
steep
that
there
is
scarce
a
place
to
be
found
to
place
the
foot
flat
and
firm
and
the
visitor
is
every
moment
if
he
makes
the
least
slip
or
stumbles
in
danger
of
being
precipitated
down
to
the
bottom
and
once
overbalanced
there
is
no
possibility
of
stopping
himself
till
he
gets
to
the
bottom
in
which
case
he
would
doubtless
be
dashed
to
pieces
after
resting
about
half
a
dozen
times
i
arrived
at
the
top
and
found
the
ascent
equally
steep
all
the
way
up
in
many
places
i
had
to
go
on
my
hands
and
feet
to
keep
from
falling
backwards
from
this
mountain
i
could
see
the
fork
of
weber
river
about
a
mile
west
of
the
camp
looking
back
i
could
see
the
road
we
had
come
for
several
miles
but
in
every
other
direction
nothing
but
ranges
of
mountains
still
as
much
higher
than
the
one
i
was
on
as
it
is
above
the
creek
the
scenery
is
truly
wild
and
melancholy
after
surveying
the
face
of
the
country
a
little
while
i
began
to
descend
and
found
the
task
much
more
difficult
than
ascending
but
by
using
great
care
and
taking
time
i
got
down
without
accident
a
little
before
dark
solomon
chamberlain
broke
his
forward
axle
tree
about
two
miles
back
a
wagon
was
unloaded
and
sent
back
to
fetch
him
up
he
is
yet
very
sick
saturday
july
arose
to
behold
a
fine
pleasant
morning
my
health
much
better
this
is
my
birthday
my
mind
naturally
reverts
back
to
my
family
and
my
heart
is
filled
with
blessings
on
their
heads
more
than
my
tongue
is
able
to
express
the
richest
blessings
that
ever
were
bestowed
upon
the
head
of
woman
or
child
could
not
be
more
than
i
desire
for
them
whatever
be
my
lot
president
young
is
reported
as
having
had
a
very
sick
night
a
forge
was
set
up
and
some
repairs
done
to
wagons
and
brother
chamberlain
repaired
also
the
cattle
and
mules
seem
very
uneasy
and
continue
lowing
and
braying
all
the
morning
i
suppose
it
is
in
consequence
of
the
singular
echoes
they
no
doubt
thinking
they
are
answered
by
others
over
the
mountains
at
the
camp
renewed
the
journey
and
one
mile
farther
arrived
at
the
red
fork
of
the
weber
river
we
also
seem
to
have
a
wide
space
to
travel
through
and
now
turn
to
the
right
in
a
western
course
the
ravine
having
run
mostly
southwest
the
distance
we
have
traveled
through
this
narrow
pass
is
miles
yesterday
was
the
first
day
we
have
been
out
of
sight
of
snow
a
whole
day
since
we
arrived
at
fort
john
we
could
not
see
it
for
the
high
mountains
although
surrounded
by
it
on
arriving
at
this
stream
we
see
it
again
on
the
mountains
to
the
east
this
stream
is
about
four
rods
wide
very
clear
water
and
apparently
about
three
feet
deep
on
an
average
its
banks
lined
with
cottonwood
and
birch
and
also
dense
patches
of
brush
wood
willows
rose
bushes
briers
etc
by
stepping
to
the
top
of
a
small
mound
at
the
bend
of
the
road
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
can
be
seen
very
plainly
as
also
the
mountains
between
which
we
pass
to
avoid
it
the
canyon
appears
to
be
about
eight
or
ten
miles
west
of
us
i
should
judge
not
over
that
president
young
being
so
very
sick
found
he
could
not
endure
to
travel
farther
accordingly
elder
kimball
and
some
others
went
to
select
a
camping
ground
and
soon
returning
reported
a
place
a
little
farther
the
camp
moved
on
and
formed
encampment
on
the
banks
of
the
river
having
traveled
two
and
a
half
miles
the
day
very
hot
and
mosquitoes
plentiful
several
of
the
brethren
have
caught
some
fine
trout
in
this
stream
which
appears
to
have
many
in
it
in
the
afternoon
elders
kimball
richards
smith
benson
and
others
went
onto
a
mountain
to
clothe
and
pray
for
president
young
who
continues
very
sick
on
returning
they
rolled
down
many
large
rocks
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
to
witness
the
velocity
of
their
descent
etc
some
would
roll
over
half
a
mile
and
frequently
break
to
pieces
john
nixon
found
and
brought
to
camp
a
very
singular
kind
of
thistle
which
i
have
never
seen
before
nor
recollect
of
ever
reading
of
the
like
he
found
it
on
the
low
land
near
the
camp
and
says
there
are
many
more
like
it
it
is
a
great
curiosity
and
worthy
of
description
the
stem
is
about
four
feet
long
about
six
inches
wide
and
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
it
is
formed
of
a
double
leaf
or
case
and
when
broken
is
hollow
although
the
stem
lies
close
together
perfectly
flat
it
is
ornamented
with
prickles
from
bottom
to
top
these
leaves
are
but
sparsely
scattered
all
along
up
the
stem
the
top
is
a
kind
of
crown
and
bush
formed
by
the
same
kind
of
prickly
leaves
and
is
about
ten
inches
long
by
five
inches
broad
forming
a
very
handsome
head
or
crown
but
the
great
curiosity
of
this
thistle
is
a
perfect
resemblance
of
a
snake
coiled
around
the
crown
as
though
in
the
act
of
guarding
it
against
foes
the
head
of
the
snake
lies
on
the
top
of
the
crown
at
one
end
and
is
ornamented
by
a
small
bunch
of
flowers
like
common
thistle
flowers
on
the
snake
head
at
the
extremity
of
the
tail
is
a
bunch
of
small
burrs
covered
with
prickles
something
resembling
the
rattles
on
a
rattlesnake
tail
the
body
of
the
snake
is
formed
of
the
same
kind
of
substance
as
the
thistle
itself
and
has
a
very
singular
appearance
it
seems
that
two
of
the
great
enemies
of
mankind
have
combined
the
most
bitter
and
destructive
guarding
the
more
innocent
the
serpent
tempted
the
woman
causing
her
to
sin
in
consequence
of
which
the
earth
was
cursed
and
decreed
to
produce
thorns
and
thistles
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
the
snake
guard
the
thistle
in
the
evening
elders
kimball
smith
and
howard
egan
rode
down
the
river
to
visit
the
canyon
they
returned
about
ten
and
said
they
had
been
eight
miles
down
the
river
but
at
that
distance
did
not
arrive
at
the
canyon
and
being
late
they
concluded
to
return
to
camp
sunday
july
this
morning
the
camp
was
called
together
and
addressed
by
elder
kimball
he
reports
president
young
as
being
a
very
sick
man
he
proposed
to
the
brethren
that
instead
of
their
scattering
off
some
hunting
some
fishing
and
some
climbing
mountains
that
they
should
meet
together
and
pray
and
exhort
each
other
that
the
lord
may
turn
away
sickness
from
our
midst
and
from
our
president
that
we
may
proceed
on
our
journey
it
was
decided
to
assemble
at
ten
and
at
the
sound
of
the
bugle
the
brethren
met
in
a
small
grove
of
shrubbery
which
they
have
made
for
the
purpose
opposite
the
wagons
during
the
meeting
elder
kimball
proposed
to
the
brethren
that
all
the
camp
except
president
young
and
eight
or
ten
other
wagons
with
brethren
enough
to
take
care
of
him
proceed
on
tomorrow
and
go
through
find
a
good
place
begin
to
plant
potatoes
as
we
have
little
time
to
spare
the
proposition
was
acceeded
to
by
unanimous
vote
and
after
a
number
had
expressed
their
feelings
the
meeting
adjourned
till
two
at
which
time
they
again
assembled
and
listened
to
remarks
from
a
number
of
the
brethren
elder
kimball
again
gave
much
good
instruction
and
prophesied
of
good
things
concerning
the
camp
the
bishops
broke
bread
and
the
sacrament
was
administered
good
feelings
seem
to
prevail
and
the
brethren
desire
to
do
right
a
number
yet
continue
sick
but
we
expect
all
will
soon
recover
the
day
is
very
hot
with
very
little
air
moving
elder
kimball
consented
for
me
to
go
on
tomorrow
with
the
company
that
goes
ahead
monday
july
morning
fine
and
warm
president
young
considerably
better
at
we
started
onward
leaving
president
young
and
kimball
wagons
and
several
others
we
found
the
road
very
rough
on
account
of
loose
rocks
and
cobble
stones
after
traveling
two
and
a
quarter
miles
we
forded
the
river
and
found
it
about
eighteen
inches
deep
but
proceeded
without
difficulty
soon
after
we
were
over
elder
snow
came
up
and
said
the
camp
were
requested
to
halt
awhile
till
richards
came
one
of
his
oxen
is
missing
and
he
wished
to
go
on
we
concluded
to
move
on
a
little
to
where
the
road
should
turn
off
between
the
mountains
to
avoid
the
canyon
elder
pratt
went
three
miles
out
of
his
road
and
had
to
return
again
of
a
mile
from
the
ford
we
found
the
place
to
make
the
cutoff
and
there
halted
awhile
i
put
a
guide
board
up
at
this
place
marked
as
follows
pratt
pass
to
avoid
canyon
to
fort
bridger
miles
brother
pack
having
charge
of
the
company
concluded
to
move
on
slowly
and
be
making
our
way
up
the
mountains
we
accordingly
started
and
after
traveling
a
mile
from
the
forks
began
to
ascend
and
wind
around
the
mountains
we
found
the
road
exceedingly
rough
and
crooked
and
very
dangerous
on
wagons
three
and
a
half
miles
from
the
forks
of
the
road
the
brethren
made
a
bridge
over
a
small
creek
over
which
we
crossed
having
passed
a
number
of
springs
near
the
road
two
and
a
quarter
miles
farther
we
arrived
on
the
summit
of
the
dividing
ridge
and
put
a
guide
board
up
miles
to
fort
bridger
at
this
place
elders
kimball
woodruff
smith
and
egan
rode
up
to
view
the
road
etc
the
descent
is
not
very
steep
but
exceedingly
dangerous
to
wagons
being
mostly
on
the
side
hill
over
large
cobble
stones
causing
the
wagons
to
slide
very
badly
after
traveling
a
little
way
smith
wagon
wheels
gave
way
going
down
a
steep
pitch
the
spokes
are
loose
in
the
hub
and
worked
about
so
that
when
the
wagon
slides
they
dish
inward
etc
at
two
we
halted
beside
a
small
creek
to
water
teams
having
traveled
ten
and
a
half
miles
over
exceedingly
rough
road
a
wagon
was
unloaded
and
sent
for
smith
loading
which
is
reported
to
be
two
miles
back
while
they
were
gone
many
turned
out
their
teams
to
graze
at
the
men
returned
with
the
wagons
putting
the
loading
into
several
so
as
to
proceed
and
at
we
started
forward
the
road
turning
suddenly
to
the
right
for
about
of
a
mile
and
then
a
southwest
course
again
here
we
ascend
a
very
long
steep
hill
for
nearly
a
mile
then
descend
by
a
very
crooked
road
i
think
a
better
road
might
be
made
here
and
this
high
hill
avoided
and
save
a
mile
travel
after
traveling
a
little
over
three
miles
we
crossed
a
creek
about
a
rod
wide
and
eighteen
inches
deep
pretty
steep
going
down
but
good
going
out
we
went
on
a
little
farther
and
at
half
past
five
camped
on
a
small
spot
surrounded
by
willow
bushes
full
of
mosquitoes
having
traveled
this
afternoon
three
and
a
quarter
miles
and
during
the
day
thirteen
and
the
day
has
been
hot
and
no
wind
teams
sweat
much
and
it
has
been
a
pretty
hard
day
travel
there
is
not
much
grass
here
but
is
said
to
be
more
plentiful
a
little
farther
several
accidents
have
happened
to
wagons
today
but
nothing
serious
except
brother
smith
richards
wagons
arrived
in
camp
at
the
same
time
the
rest
did
the
sick
are
getting
better
in
the
evening
the
brethren
picked
up
a
lot
of
dry
willows
and
made
a
coal
pit
to
set
smith
tire
before
we
can
leave
tomorrow
the
evening
and
night
were
very
cold
tuesday
july
this
morning
fine
and
warm
the
coal
pit
is
burned
and
burr
frost
set
elder
smith
wagon
tire
and
did
various
other
repairs
to
a
number
of
other
wagons
which
took
till
nearly
eleven
about
which
time
the
camp
started
onward
one
of
brother
crow
men
returned
from
elder
pratt
company
and
reported
that
their
camp
is
about
nine
miles
from
here
he
is
hunting
stray
cattle
he
says
the
road
is
very
rough
from
here
and
about
a
mile
beyond
where
they
are
camped
the
road
begins
to
ascend
over
a
high
range
of
mountains
elder
pratt
has
been
to
the
top
but
can
not
see
the
salt
lake
from
there
their
company
is
gone
on
i
walked
ahead
of
the
camp
nearly
four
miles
and
picked
many
gooseberries
nearly
ripe
they
are
very
plentiful
on
this
bottom
the
brethren
spent
much
time
cutting
brush
wood
and
improving
the
road
after
traveling
four
miles
halted
about
half
an
hour
to
water
teams
and
eat
dinner
the
road
over
which
we
have
traveled
is
through
an
uneven
gap
between
high
mountains
and
is
exceedingly
rough
and
crooked
not
a
place
to
be
met
with
scarcely
where
there
would
be
room
to
camp
for
the
dense
willow
groves
all
along
the
bottom
we
then
proceeded
on
and
traveled
over
the
same
kind
of
rough
road
till
a
little
after
then
camped
on
a
ridge
having
traveled
today
seven
and
a
quarter
miles
the
last
three
miles
has
been
the
worst
road
of
the
two
it
being
through
willow
bushes
over
twenty
feet
high
also
rose
and
gooseberry
bushes
and
shaking
poplar
and
birch
timber
although
there
has
been
a
road
cut
through
it
is
yet
scarcely
possible
to
travel
without
tearing
the
wagon
covers
we
have
crossed
this
creek
which
elder
pratt
names
canyon
creek
eleven
times
during
the
day
and
the
road
is
one
of
the
most
crooked
i
ever
saw
many
sharp
turns
in
it
and
the
willow
stubs
standing
making
it
very
severe
on
wagons
as
we
proceed
up
the
gap
between
the
mountains
seems
to
grow
still
narrower
until
arriving
at
this
place
where
there
is
room
to
camp
but
little
grass
for
teams
there
are
many
springs
along
the
road
but
the
water
is
not
very
good
in
one
place
about
a
mile
back
there
is
a
very
bad
swamp
where
the
brethren
spent
some
time
cutting
willows
and
laying
them
in
to
improve
it
we
have
got
along
today
without
much
damage
which
is
somewhat
favorable
for
the
road
is
awful
at
this
place
the
ground
around
is
represented
as
being
swampy
and
dangerous
for
cattle
it
is
reported
that
there
is
no
place
to
camp
beyond
this
till
where
elder
company
camped
and
this
is
so
small
they
have
to
huddle
the
wagons
together
the
soil
continues
sandy
except
in
the
low
moist
places
where
it
looks
black
and
good
there
is
some
pine
occasionally
in
sight
on
the
mountains
but
timber
here
is
scarce
we
have
passed
through
some
small
patches
today
where
a
few
house
logs
might
be
cut
but
this
is
truly
a
wild
looking
place
wednesday
july
we
started
onward
at
half
past
six
the
morning
fine
and
pleasant
we
crossed
the
creek
once
more
and
about
a
half
a
mile
from
where
we
camped
the
road
turns
to
the
right
leaving
the
creek
and
ascending
the
mountains
gradually
much
time
was
necessarily
spent
cutting
down
stumps
heaving
out
rocks
and
leveling
the
road
it
is
an
exceedingly
rough
place
there
are
several
springs
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
one
a
mile
from
the
top
which
runs
above
the
ground
a
little
distance
then
sinks
under
again
the
last
half
mile
of
the
ascent
is
very
steep
and
the
nearer
the
top
the
steeper
it
grows
there
is
considerable
timber
up
this
gap
but
mostly
destroyed
by
fire
we
saw
a
prairie
pheasant
while
going
up
and
some
wild
gooseberries
at
eleven
the
teams
began
to
arrive
on
the
dividing
ridge
and
in
less
than
an
hour
all
were
safely
up
from
this
ridge
we
can
see
an
extensive
valley
to
the
west
but
on
every
other
side
high
mountains
many
of
them
white
with
snow
it
seems
as
though
a
few
hours
travel
might
bring
us
out
from
the
mountains
on
good
road
again
we
halted
on
the
ridge
a
little
while
and
then
prepared
to
descend
many
locking
both
hind
wheels
a
precaution
not
at
all
unnecessary
we
found
the
road
down
exceedingly
steep
and
rendered
dangerous
by
the
many
stumps
of
trees
left
standing
in
the
road
the
brethren
cut
up
many
of
them
which
delayed
us
much
about
a
mile
down
is
a
bridge
formed
of
small
trees
laid
one
on
another
to
fill
up
a
deep
ravine
it
is
steep
on
both
sides
and
here
joseph
rooker
turned
his
wagon
over
however
without
much
damage
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
top
is
a
spring
and
small
stream
of
very
good
cold
water
where
we
halted
to
let
teams
drink
this
would
make
a
tolerably
good
camp
ground
in
case
of
necessity
after
this
the
road
is
not
so
steep
but
is
very
rough
and
winds
between
high
hills
or
mountains
through
willows
and
brush
wood
and
over
soft
places
crossing
the
creek
a
number
of
times
at
four
and
a
half
miles
from
the
top
of
the
ridge
we
arrived
at
a
good
spring
of
cold
water
plenty
of
grass
and
a
good
place
to
camp
our
teams
have
now
been
in
the
harness
about
ten
hours
without
eating
and
the
feeling
of
many
was
to
stay
here
but
some
wanted
to
go
on
and
we
continued
turning
suddenly
to
the
right
a
little
below
this
spring
we
began
to
ascend
another
high
ridge
and
while
ascending
some
of
the
teams
began
to
fail
there
are
a
great
many
service
berries
on
this
ridge
growing
on
what
we
supposed
to
be
wild
apple
trees
the
berries
are
good
and
rich
when
ripe
the
descent
from
this
ridge
is
not
nearly
so
steep
as
the
other
one
yet
many
locked
both
hind
wheels
after
descending
we
found
another
small
creek
and
a
very
rough
road
again
at
we
formed
our
encampment
near
the
creek
having
traveled
fourteen
miles
in
thirteen
hours
there
is
but
little
grass
here
and
a
poor
chance
for
cattle
orson
pratt
company
are
camped
a
half
a
mile
ahead
of
us
and
our
camp
was
formed
by
colonel
markham
he
says
they
have
had
many
new
cases
of
sickness
but
mostly
getting
better
the
cannon
is
left
back
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
about
a
mile
back
from
this
place
there
is
a
small
grove
of
sugar
maple
and
considerable
other
timber
along
the
creek
there
are
also
beds
of
nice
green
rushes
in
several
places
thursday
july
this
morning
is
cloudy
and
some
like
for
rain
we
started
on
at
and
soon
came
up
with
elder
pratt
company
there
were
several
bad
places
in
the
road
where
the
brethren
spent
considerable
time
fixing
them
as
we
near
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
there
is
a
small
grove
of
elder
bushes
in
bloom
and
considerable
oak
shrubbery
we
named
this
a
canyon
because
of
the
very
high
mountains
on
each
side
leaving
but
a
few
rods
of
a
bottom
for
the
creek
to
pass
through
and
hardly
room
for
a
road
it
is
evident
that
the
emigrants
who
passed
this
way
last
year
must
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
cutting
a
road
through
the
thickly
set
timber
and
heavy
brush
wood
it
is
reported
that
they
spent
sixteen
days
in
making
a
road
through
from
weber
river
which
is
miles
but
as
the
men
did
not
work
a
quarter
of
their
time
much
less
would
have
sufficed
however
it
has
taken
us
over
three
days
after
the
road
is
made
although
a
great
many
hours
have
been
spent
in
improving
it
in
this
thick
brush
wood
and
around
here
there
are
many
very
large
rattlesnakes
lurking
making
it
necessary
to
use
caution
while
passing
through
after
traveling
one
and
miles
we
found
the
road
crossing
the
creek
again
to
the
north
side
and
then
ascending
up
a
very
steep
high
hill
it
is
so
very
steep
as
to
be
almost
impossible
for
heavy
wagons
to
ascend
and
so
narrow
that
the
least
accident
might
precipitate
a
wagon
down
a
bank
three
or
four
hundred
feet
in
which
case
it
would
certainly
be
dashed
to
pieces
colonel
markham
and
another
man
went
over
the
hill
and
returned
up
the
canyon
to
see
if
a
road
can
not
be
cut
through
and
avoid
this
hill
while
passing
up
a
bear
started
near
them
but
soon
was
out
of
sight
amongst
the
very
high
grass
brother
markham
says
a
good
road
can
soon
be
made
down
the
canyon
by
digging
a
little
and
cutting
through
the
bushes
some
ten
or
fifteen
rods
a
number
of
men
went
to
work
immediately
to
make
the
road
which
will
be
much
better
than
to
attempt
crossing
the
hill
and
will
be
sooner
done
agreeable
to
president
young
instructions
elder
pratt
accompanied
by
george
smith
john
brown
joseph
mathews
john
pack
rockwell
and
little
started
on
this
morning
on
horses
to
seek
out
a
suitable
place
to
plant
some
potatoes
turnips
so
as
to
preserve
the
seed
at
least
while
the
brethren
were
cutting
the
road
i
followed
the
old
one
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
on
arriving
there
was
much
cheered
by
a
handsome
view
of
the
great
salt
lake
lying
as
i
should
judge
from
to
thirty
miles
to
the
west
of
us
and
at
eleven
i
sat
down
to
contemplate
and
view
the
surrounding
scenery
there
is
an
extensive
beautiful
level
looking
valley
from
here
to
the
lake
which
i
should
judge
from
the
numerous
deep
green
patches
must
be
fertile
and
rich
the
valley
extends
to
the
south
probably
fifty
miles
where
it
is
again
surrounded
by
high
mountains
to
the
southwest
across
the
valley
at
about
twenty
to
miles
distance
is
a
high
mountain
extending
from
the
south
end
of
the
valley
to
about
opposite
this
place
where
it
ceases
abruptly
leaving
a
pleasant
view
of
the
dark
waters
of
the
lake
standing
on
the
lake
and
about
due
west
there
are
two
mountains
and
far
in
the
distance
another
one
which
i
suppose
is
on
the
other
side
the
lake
probably
from
sixty
to
eighty
miles
distance
to
the
northwest
is
another
mountain
at
the
base
of
which
is
a
lone
ridge
of
what
i
should
consider
to
be
rock
salt
from
its
white
and
shining
appearance
the
lake
does
not
show
at
this
distance
a
very
extensive
surface
but
its
dark
blue
shade
resembling
the
calm
sea
looks
very
handsome
the
intervening
valley
appears
to
be
well
supplied
with
streams
creeks
and
lakes
some
of
the
latter
are
evidently
salt
there
is
but
little
timber
in
sight
anywhere
and
that
is
mostly
on
the
banks
of
creeks
and
streams
of
water
which
is
about
the
only
objection
which
could
be
raised
in
my
estimation
to
this
being
one
of
the
most
beautiful
valleys
and
pleasant
places
for
a
home
for
the
saints
which
could
be
found
timber
is
evidently
lacking
but
we
have
not
expected
to
find
a
timbered
country
there
may
be
timber
on
the
mountains
which
the
long
distance
would
render
impossible
to
be
seen
with
the
naked
eye
but
the
mountains
through
which
we
have
passed
have
very
little
on
them
in
some
places
may
be
seen
a
grove
of
small
fir
or
cedar
or
pine
and
in
the
valleys
some
cottonwood
and
other
small
timber
there
is
doubtless
timber
in
all
passes
and
ravines
where
streams
descend
from
the
mountains
there
is
no
prospect
for
building
log
houses
without
spending
a
vast
amount
of
time
and
labor
but
we
can
make
spanish
brick
and
dry
them
in
the
sun
or
we
can
build
lodges
as
the
pawnee
indians
do
in
their
villages
for
my
own
part
i
am
happily
disappointed
in
the
appearance
of
the
valley
of
the
salt
lake
but
if
the
land
be
as
rich
as
it
has
the
appearance
of
being
i
have
no
fears
but
the
saints
can
live
here
and
do
well
while
we
will
do
right
when
i
commune
with
my
own
heart
and
ask
myself
whether
i
would
choose
to
dwell
here
in
this
wild
looking
country
amongst
the
saints
surrounded
by
friends
though
poor
enjoying
the
privileges
and
blessings
of
the
everlasting
priesthood
with
god
for
our
king
and
father
or
dwell
amongst
the
gentiles
with
all
their
wealth
and
good
things
of
the
earth
to
be
eternally
mobbed
harassed
hunted
our
best
men
murdered
and
every
good
man
life
continually
in
danger
the
soft
whisper
echoes
loud
and
reverberates
back
in
tones
of
stern
determination
give
me
the
quiet
wilderness
and
my
family
to
associate
with
surrounded
by
the
saints
and
adieu
to
the
gentile
world
till
god
says
return
and
avenge
you
of
your
enemies
if
i
had
my
family
with
me
how
happy
could
i
be
for
i
dread
nothing
so
much
as
the
journey
back
again
and
when
i
think
of
the
many
dangers
from
accident
which
families
traveling
this
road
are
continually
liable
to
and
especially
this
last
mountain
road
from
weber
river
it
makes
me
almost
shudder
to
think
of
it
and
i
could
almost
envy
those
who
have
got
safely
through
having
their
families
with
them
yet
they
will
doubtless
have
a
hard
time
of
it
the
coming
winter
brother
crow
family
especially
have
very
little
bread
stuff
with
them
they
say
enough
to
last
them
two
months
and
they
are
dependent
on
the
success
of
their
hunter
for
support
through
the
winter
this
valley
appears
to
be
fortified
by
mountains
except
on
the
banks
of
the
lake
on
many
of
which
there
is
still
snow
lying
in
large
quantities
it
is
certain
that
good
limestone
abounds
in
these
ridges
and
it
is
supposed
coal
can
be
found
with
little
labor
from
this
hill
i
passed
down
the
creek
which
we
named
the
last
creek
about
a
mile
and
there
saw
a
bed
of
bull
rushes
of
the
largest
kind
i
ever
saw
some
of
them
being
fifteen
feet
high
and
an
inch
and
a
half
in
diameter
at
the
bottom
the
grass
on
this
creek
grows
from
six
to
twelve
feet
high
and
appears
very
rank
there
are
some
ducks
around
and
sand
hill
cranes
many
signs
of
deer
antelope
and
bears
but
not
many
have
been
seen
here
there
have
been
fresh
buffalo
signs
seen
a
few
days
travel
back
but
those
animals
evidently
do
not
stay
in
this
region
unless
some
come
to
winter
the
ground
seems
literally
alive
with
the
very
large
black
crickets
crawling
around
up
grass
and
bushes
they
look
loathsome
but
are
said
to
be
excellent
for
fattening
hogs
which
would
feed
on
them
voraciously
the
bears
evidently
live
mostly
on
them
at
this
season
of
the
year
after
spending
about
four
hours
labor
the
brethren
succeeded
in
cutting
a
pretty
good
road
along
the
creek
and
the
wagons
proceeded
on
taking
near
a
southwest
course
we
found
the
last
descent
even
but
very
rapid
all
the
way
at
half
past
five
we
formed
our
encampment
on
a
creek
supposed
to
be
brown
creek
having
traveled
seven
and
a
quarter
miles
today
we
are
now
five
and
a
quarter
miles
from
the
mouth
of
this
canyon
making
the
whole
distance
of
rough
mountain
road
from
the
weber
river
to
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
on
this
side
a
little
less
than
miles
and
decidedly
the
worst
piece
of
road
on
the
whole
journey
at
this
place
the
land
is
black
and
looks
rich
sandy
enough
to
make
it
good
to
work
the
grass
grows
high
and
thick
on
the
ground
and
is
well
mixed
with
nice
green
rushes
feed
here
for
our
teams
is
very
plentiful
and
good
and
the
water
is
also
good
there
are
many
rattlesnakes
of
a
large
size
in
this
valley
and
it
is
supposed
they
have
dens
in
the
mountains
the
land
looks
dry
and
lacks
rain
but
the
numerous
creeks
and
springs
must
necessarily
tend
to
moisten
it
much
the
grass
looks
rich
and
good
a
while
after
we
camped
elder
pratt
and
company
returned
and
reported
that
they
had
been
about
fifteen
miles
north
from
here
and
this
region
is
as
suitable
a
place
to
put
in
our
seeds
as
they
have
seen
approaching
nearer
the
lake
the
land
is
mostly
sunken
and
many
small
lakes
in
it
a
few
miles
north
of
this
is
a
good
spot
to
break
up
and
plant
potatoes
sow
our
seeds
etc
there
is
a
little
timber
on
the
creek
from
twelve
to
fifteen
miles
north
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
they
saw
many
hot
sulphur
springs
issuing
from
the
rocks
as
many
as
fifty
in
number
one
of
them
the
largest
falls
out
of
the
rocks
and
then
forms
a
pool
apparently
ten
feet
deep
and
a
rock
is
in
the
center
the
water
of
this
is
so
hot
a
person
can
not
bear
his
hand
in
it
but
a
very
few
seconds
it
is
strong
of
salt
and
sulphur
and
the
bottom
appears
green
as
though
it
was
covered
with
verdigris
a
council
was
held
at
the
doctor
wagon
and
it
was
decided
to
move
early
tomorrow
to
the
place
designated
also
to
send
two
men
back
to
the
president
and
company
to
report
our
progress
then
to
commence
forthwith
and
plow
and
plant
about
ten
acres
with
potatoes
this
week
if
possible
and
thus
continue
till
the
seed
is
secured
john
pack
and
joseph
mathews
were
selected
to
return
to
president
young
company
the
evening
was
fine
and
pleasant
and
the
night
feels
much
warmer
than
in
the
ravines
of
the
mountains
friday
july
this
morning
elders
pack
and
mathews
started
to
meet
the
president
and
at
the
same
time
the
camp
moved
on
to
the
final
location
we
traveled
two
miles
and
then
formed
our
encampment
on
the
banks
of
the
creek
in
an
oblong
circle
the
grass
here
appears
even
richer
and
thicker
on
the
ground
than
where
we
left
this
morning
the
soil
looks
indeed
rich
black
and
a
little
sandy
the
grass
is
about
four
feet
high
and
very
thick
on
the
ground
and
well
mixed
with
rushes
if
we
stay
here
three
weeks
and
our
teams
have
any
rest
they
will
be
in
good
order
to
return
as
soon
as
the
camp
was
formed
a
meeting
was
called
and
the
brethren
addressed
by
elder
richards
mostly
on
the
necessity
and
propriety
of
working
faithfully
and
diligently
to
get
potatoes
turnips
in
the
ground
elder
pratt
reported
their
mission
yesterday
and
after
some
remarks
the
meeting
was
dismissed
at
the
opening
the
brethren
united
in
prayer
and
asked
the
lord
to
send
rain
on
the
land
etc
the
brethren
immediately
rigged
three
plows
and
went
to
plowing
a
little
northeast
of
the
camp
another
party
went
with
spades
to
make
a
dam
on
one
of
the
creeks
so
as
to
throw
the
water
at
pleasure
on
the
field
designing
to
irrigate
the
land
in
case
rain
should
not
come
sufficiently
this
land
is
beautifully
situated
for
irrigation
many
nice
streams
descending
from
the
mountains
which
can
be
turned
in
every
direction
so
as
to
water
any
portion
of
the
lands
at
pleasure
during
the
afternoon
heavy
clouds
began
to
collect
in
the
southwest
and
at
five
we
had
a
light
shower
with
thunder
we
had
rains
for
about
two
hours
the
brethren
have
plowed
up
considerable
land
and
broken
several
of
their
plows
but
there
have
been
three
plows
going
nearly
all
day
at
night
the
camp
was
called
together
and
addressed
by
elder
richards
on
a
subject
which
seemed
little
welcome
to
many
from
the
way
it
was
handled
it
was
a
sermon
of
from
end
to
end
some
felt
a
little
insulted
but
it
all
passed
off
well
and
jokingly
saturday
july
the
plowing
is
renewed
and
many
are
gone
to
planting
potatoes
there
is
one
drag
going
others
are
still
at
work
on
the
dams
john
pack
and
joseph
mathews
returned
at
dark
last
night
and
reported
the
president
and
company
a
few
miles
up
last
creek
they
have
gone
back
this
morning
to
fix
two
bridges
at
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
the
day
is
fine
and
hot
with
a
nice
breeze
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
president
young
and
kimball
arrived
and
the
wagons
also
began
to
arrive
at
the
same
time
the
president
seems
much
better
and
the
sick
generally
are
getting
better
most
of
the
brethren
express
themselves
well
pleased
with
the
place
but
some
complain
because
there
is
no
timber
there
appears
to
be
a
unanimous
agreement
in
regard
to
the
richness
of
the
soil
and
there
are
good
prospects
of
sustaining
and
fattening
stock
with
little
trouble
the
only
objection
is
a
lack
of
timber
and
rain
the
latter
god
will
send
in
its
season
if
the
saints
are
faithful
and
i
think
yesterday
was
a
proof
that
he
listens
to
and
answers
the
prayers
of
the
saints
we
can
easily
irrigate
the
land
at
all
events
which
will
be
an
unfailing
and
certain
source
of
water
for
the
springs
are
numerous
and
the
water
appears
good
about
we
were
favored
with
another
nice
shower
accompanied
by
thunder
and
some
wind
it
continued
raining
till
nearly
dark
the
balance
of
the
evening
fine
elder
kimball
says
that
it
is
contemplated
to
send
out
an
exploring
party
to
start
on
monday
and
proceed
north
to
the
bear
river
and
cache
valleys
they
design
taking
several
wagons
with
them
and
presidents
young
and
kimball
accompany
the
expedition
another
company
is
to
start
at
the
same
time
and
go
west
to
the
lake
then
south
to
the
utah
lake
and
return
down
this
valley
sunday
july
morning
fine
and
pleasant
at
ten
a
meeting
was
held
in
the
camp
and
the
brethren
addressed
successively
by
elders
smith
kimball
and
benson
these
mostly
expressing
their
feeling
of
gratification
for
the
prospects
of
this
country
each
being
highly
satisfied
with
the
soil
etc
elder
kimball
referred
especially
to
the
manifold
blessings
we
have
been
favored
with
during
the
journey
not
a
man
woman
or
child
has
died
on
the
journey
not
even
a
horse
mule
ox
cow
or
chicken
has
died
during
the
whole
journey
many
exhortations
were
given
to
the
brethren
to
be
faithful
obey
the
council
of
those
in
authority
and
we
shall
be
blessed
and
prosperous
at
by
request
of
elder
kimball

a

hosea
cusing
robert
byard
orson
whitney
and
horace
whitney
assembled
themselves
in
a
willow
grove
adjacent
to
the
camp
where
elder
kimball
addressed
them
in
substance
as
follows
the
whole
reported
by
horace
whitney
most
of
you
here
present
have
become
adopted
into
my
family
except
a
very
few
calling
them
by
name
and
horace
who
has
become
connected
with
my
family
by
marriage
but
i
do
not
care
for
that
you
are
all
the
same
to
me
and
your
interest
is
my
interest
for
what
mine
is
yours
and
what
yours
is
your
own
if
i
have
the
privilege
of
building
a
house
i
want
you
to
help
me
and
i
will
help
you
horace
will
want
to
build
a
house
for
some
of
his
father
family
if
they
should
come
up
and
there
is
plenty
of
timber
in
the
hills
when
my
family
comes
up
we
may
conclude
to
settle
somewhere
else
if
so
there
will
be
plenty
to
buy
us
out
if
we
shall
have
made
any
improvements
i
want
you
all
to
be
prudent
and
take
care
of
your
horses
cattle
and
everything
entrusted
to
your
care
it
would
be
a
good
plan
and
probably
will
be
done
for
those
who
stay
here
to
go
back
on
the
sweet
water
and
kill
buffalo
for
winter
consumption
we
shall
go
tomorrow
if
brigham
is
well
enough
in
search
of
a
better
location
if
indeed
such
can
be
found
if
not
we
shall
remain
here
there
should
be
an
enclosure
made
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
horses
and
cattle
in
nights
for
there
are
plenty
of
indians
in
the
vicinity
i
should
advise
you
to
keep
the
sabbath
day
holy
whether
others
do
or
not
i
want
you
to
put
all
the
seed
into
the
ground
that
you
think
will
come
to
maturity
i
am
satisfied
that
buckwheat
will
do
as
well
here
as
any
other
seed
we
can
grow
i
want
also
some
peach
stones
and
apple
seeds
to
be
planted
forthwith
brother
byard
and
hans
i
would
like
to
have
immediately
engage
in
making
garments
of
buck
skins
brother
cloward
in
making
shoes
and
brother
johnson
in
making
hats
as
soon
as
practicable
if
you
wish
to
go
hunting
fishing
or
to
see
the
country
select
a
week
day
and
not
the
lord
day
for
that
purpose
do
not
let
us
get
giddy
and
light
minded
as
the
nephites
did
of
old
but
strive
to
work
righteousness
in
the
beginning
inasmuch
as
we
have
reached
the
promised
land
if
it
is
advisable
to
work
in
a
family
capacity
we
will
do
so
and
if
in
a
church
capacity
we
should
be
equally
willing
to
do
that
i
am
going
out
on
a
scout
with
the
brethren
and
i
shall
probably
want
one
or
two
of
you
to
go
with
me
and
also
one
or
two
wagons
i
am
not
going
to
take
anything
back
with
me
to
winter
quarters
except
what
is
actually
necessary
even
some
of
my
clothes
i
shall
leave
behind
i
shall
leave
bishop
whipple
with
you
he
is
quite
a
steady
and
economical
man
and
as
such
i
recommend
him
to
you
i
want
every
man
to
be
as
industrious
as
possible
while
i
am
gone
and
get
into
the
ground
all
the
turnips
cabbage
and
other
seeds
you
can
in
case
a
storm
of
snow
should
come
on
it
would
be
advisable
to
drive
all
the
cattle
among
the
willows
where
they
can
remain
until
the
snow
goes
off
i
want
you
all
to
work
together
until
such
time
as
every
man
can
have
his
inheritance
set
off
to
him
i
feel
towards
you
as
a
father
towards
his
children
and
i
want
you
to
banish
all
peevishness
from
your
midst
and
accommodate
yourselves
as
much
as
possible
to
each
other
wishes
i
have
it
to
say
that
my
boys
have
been
faithful
to
their
various
duties
on
this
journey
and
other
people
have
noticed
it
and
expressed
the
opinion
that
they
never
saw
such
an
attentive
set
of
men
in
their
lives
and
i
consider
that
their
conduct
is
worthy
of
imitation
i
want
you
to
be
sober
and
prayerful
and
remember
me
and
my
family
in
your
prayers
a
number
of
other
good
ideas
were
advanced
by
brother
heber
and
then
we
closed
the
meeting
by
prayer
at
the
brethren
again
assembled
within
the
camp
and
were
successively
addressed
by
elders
woodruff
orson
pratt
and
richards
sustaining
the
ideas
advanced
by
the
other
brethren
this
morning
some
remarks
followed
from
lorenzo
young
john
pack
and
others
and
the
meeting
was
dismissed
it
is
contemplated
to
send
some
wagons
back
to
lighten
the
loads
and
assist
the
next
company
over
these
rough
roads
it
is
now
certain
that
there
is
considerable
timber
in
the
ravines
and
valleys
between
the
mountains
several
large
bodies
having
been
seen
by
the
brethren
since
our
arrival
there
is
a
mountain
lying
northeast
from
here
on
which
is
considerably
large
timber
it
is
supposed
to
be
about
ten
miles
distance
the
northern
expedition
is
given
up
for
the
present
on
account
of
president
young
health
a
company
intend
to
go
tomorrow
to
the
lake
and
survey
that
region
if
they
go
they
will
probably
be
gone
a
day
or
two
monday
july
morning
cloudy
and
pleasant
the
brethren
commenced
plowing
early
others
are
gone
to
planting
and
the
brethren
appear
to
feel
well
some
of
the
sick
have
been
to
bathe
in
one
of
the
hot
springs
and
pronounce
the
effects
wonderfully
beneficial
others
are
going
this
morning
to
try
the
same
experiment
another
company
are
gone
to
make
a
road
to
the
timber
through
a
ravine
a
little
north
of
this
about
ten
president
young
sent
me
a
horse
with
instructions
to
join
him
and
some
others
going
on
a
short
exploring
expedition
i
immediately
started
and
found
the
company
consisted
of
president
young
elders
kimball
woodruff
smith
benson
richards
and
carrington
we
took
a
course
northward
passing
by
the
land
where
the
brethren
are
plowing
and
planting
the
land
indeed
looks
rich
and
light
about
of
a
mile
north
of
the
camp
we
arrived
on
a
beautiful
table
land
level
and
nicely
sloping
to
the
west
here
we
halted
to
view
it
and
the
more
we
viewed
the
better
we
were
satisfied
that
it
is
as
handsome
a
place
for
a
city
as
can
be
imagined
at
the
east
part
there
is
a
considerable
creek
of
clear
cold
water
descending
from
the
mountains
and
just
above
this
place
it
branches
into
two
forks
one
running
northwest
the
other
southwest
and
the
two
nicely
surrounding
this
place
and
so
well
arranged
that
should
a
city
be
built
here
the
water
can
be
turned
into
every
street
at
pleasure
we
passed
on
and
began
to
ascend
the
mountains
the
president
signifying
a
wish
to
ascend
a
high
peak
to
the
north
of
us
after
some
hard
toil
and
time
we
succeeded
in
gaining
the
summit
leaving
our
horses
about
the
way
up
president
young
felt
pretty
well
fatigued
when
he
got
up
some
of
the
brethren
feel
like
naming
this
ensign
peak
from
this
place
we
had
a
good
view
of
the
salt
lake
and
could
see
that
the
waters
extend
for
a
great
many
miles
to
the
north
of
us
there
appears
to
be
land
although
white
with
salt
all
the
way
to
the
mountain
on
the
northwest
which
we
had
previously
supposed
was
surrounded
by
water
we
can
see
a
pretty
large
stream
winding
from
the
south
to
the
north
through
the
valley
but
keeping
not
many
miles
distant
from
these
mountains
towards
the
lake
after
satisfying
ourselves
we
began
to
descend
president
young
and
lorenzo
who
joined
us
a
while
before
we
went
up
going
down
on
the
east
side
where
they
were
joined
by
elders
woodruff
benson
and
richards
with
the
horses
elders
kimball
smith
carrington
and
myself
descended
on
the
northwest
corner
and
found
the
descent
very
lengthy
and
difficult
these
hills
are
mostly
rocky
of
a
kind
of
soft
stone
in
some
places
in
others
a
harder
kind
of
flint
stone
on
arriving
on
the
level
again
we
wound
our
way
southward
to
meet
the
other
brethren
and
after
passing
a
little
way
saw
one
of
the
sulphur
springs
where
a
pretty
large
stream
of
sulphur
water
boils
out
of
the
rock
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
thence
branches
out
into
several
smaller
streams
for
some
distance
till
these
enter
a
small
lake
this
water
is
about
as
warm
as
dish
water
and
very
salty
there
is
much
filthy
kind
of
substance
collected
on
it
and
the
smell
arising
from
it
is
truly
nauseating
and
sickly
though
generally
supposed
to
be
in
no
way
unhealthy
elder
kimball
left
us
here
on
seeing
elder
woodruff
carriage
and
the
other
brethren
returning
back
towards
the
camp
in
the
meantime
elders
smith
carrington
and
myself
went
lower
down
towards
the
lake
in
search
of
some
fresh
water
to
quench
our
thirst
we
found
a
nice
clear
stream
of
cold
water
but
a
little
way
from
the
sulphur
spring
and
having
drunk
of
it
we
concluded
to
go
on
and
see
the
river
which
we
had
noticed
from
the
mountain
we
took
nearly
a
west
course
and
soon
struck
the
old
road
made
by
emigrants
last
year
we
found
the
land
exceedingly
rich
all
along
good
grass
and
abundance
of
rushes
we
found
many
wet
places
but
no
signs
of
swamps
nor
danger
of
miring
after
traveling
about
two
miles
we
arrived
at
the
river
having
followed
the
road
to
the
ford
this
river
is
about
five
rods
wide
on
an
average
three
and
a
half
feet
deep
at
the
ford
but
in
other
places
much
deeper
the
current
is
slow
and
the
water
of
a
dark
lead
color
the
banks
are
about
five
feet
high
and
the
soil
to
the
water
level
of
a
rich
black
alluvial
there
is
no
timber
on
the
banks
here
and
not
many
willow
bushes
we
went
over
the
river
and
found
the
soil
equally
good
on
the
other
side
while
here
we
observed
elder
woodruff
carriage
and
the
brethren
again
proceeding
northward
we
started
back
to
meet
them
it
being
the
intention
to
go
to
the
large
hot
sulphur
spring
we
could
but
remark
all
along
the
richness
of
the
soil
and
the
abundance
of
high
good
looking
grass
on
arriving
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
beside
another
sulphur
spring
we
saw
the
carriage
come
on
to
the
first
spring
but
apparently
judging
it
unsafe
to
cross
they
wheeled
around
and
returned
back
to
camp
elders
smith
carrington
and
myself
then
concluded
to
go
on
and
view
the
big
spring
which
we
found
to
be
about
two
miles
farther
before
arriving
at
it
there
is
a
large
shoal
salt
lake
and
on
the
banks
are
numerous
sulphur
springs
varying
in
the
appearance
of
the
surface
and
losing
themselves
in
the
lake
there
were
many
plovers
on
and
around
this
lake
we
arrived
at
the
big
spring
about
four
and
making
our
horses
fast
we
went
down
to
where
it
boils
out
of
the
rock
this
spring
is
also
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
and
at
the
base
of
a
large
rock
perpendicular
on
the
west
side
and
gradually
losing
itself
on
the
east
in
the
mountain
the
spring
as
i
have
said
is
at
the
base
of
this
rock
there
is
a
circular
hole
about
four
feet
wide
and
a
yard
high
from
the
top
to
the
surface
of
the
water
from
whence
the
water
boils
out
in
a
considerable
stream
the
water
itself
in
the
spring
seems
to
be
about
two
feet
deep
there
is
a
rock
at
the
mouth
of
the
spring
where
a
person
can
stand
and
see
inside
standing
on
this
rock
with
your
face
near
the
mouth
of
the
spring
a
strong
warm
sulphurous
air
is
felt
to
come
in
gusts
out
of
the
rock
and
it
is
so
hot
that
it
requires
only
a
few
minutes
to
start
the
perspiration
on
putting
my
hand
in
the
spring
i
was
startled
with
the
heat
and
found
i
could
not
bear
to
hold
my
hand
in
five
seconds
it
is
as
hot
as
the
hottest
dish
water
ever
used
for
dishes
immediately
on
emerging
from
the
rock
the
water
forms
a
lake
about
three
rods
in
diameter
and
evidently
pretty
deep
the
water
is
exceedingly
clear
and
nice
to
look
at
but
very
salty
indeed
we
could
see
the
water
boil
up
in
many
parts
of
the
lake
the
water
escapes
at
the
north
side
of
the
lake
at
the
base
of
the
rock
and
there
forms
a
stream
about
four
feet
wide
and
eighteen
inches
deep
we
concluded
we
would
go
down
the
stream
six
or
eight
rods
to
wash
our
feet
naturally
expecting
the
water
to
be
cooler
but
on
taking
off
our
boots
and
socks
we
found
it
impossible
to
hold
our
feet
in
it
a
moment
and
could
barely
wash
by
dashing
the
water
on
with
our
hands
and
suddenly
dipping
them
in
and
out
it
is
supposed
this
would
boil
an
egg
in
about
ten
minutes
at
five
we
returned
back
to
camp
and
supposed
that
the
spring
is
about
four
miles
distance
we
arrived
in
camp
at
six
the
brethren
have
planted
about
three
acres
of
potatoes
some
peas
beans
and
are
now
planting
four
or
five
acres
of
corn
elder
kimball
stated
that
on
returning
with
the
carriage
to
the
creek
near
the
camp
to
get
some
water
he
discovered
that
he
had
lost
his
spy
glass
he
retraced
his
steps
on
foot
to
the
top
of
the
peak
and
back
without
finding
it
and
on
arriving
at
the
bottom
he
saw
elders
richards
and
benson
bathing
in
one
of
the
warm
sulphur
springs
although
wet
with
perspiration
he
took
off
his
clothes
and
plunged
in
and
found
the
effects
very
pleasant
and
beneficial
after
bathing
they
started
back
for
camp
and
but
a
few
rods
distance
found
the
glass
near
the
road
some
of
the
brethren
have
commenced
making
a
garden
about
two
miles
to
the
southeast
and
indeed
their
operations
and
industry
are
truly
pleasing
and
noble
the
more
i
view
the
country
the
better
i
am
satisfied
that
the
saints
can
live
here
and
raise
abundant
crops
elder
kimball
has
kindly
offered
me
a
horse
to
ride
and
view
the
country
as
much
and
when
i
have
a
mind
to
while
we
stay
here
this
morning
joseph
mathews
and
john
brown
started
west
to
go
to
the
mountain
they
returned
this
evening
and
report
that
they
have
been
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
judge
it
to
be
about
sixteen
miles
distance
they
say
the
wild
sage
is
very
plentiful
on
the
other
side
the
valley
showing
that
the
land
is
not
so
rich
there
as
here
they
found
a
horse
near
the
mountain
and
have
brought
it
to
camp
supposed
to
have
strayed
from
emigrants
who
have
previously
passed
this
way
towards
sundown
heavy
clouds
were
noticed
in
the
south
and
southwest
we
expected
a
shower
but
it
passed
off
to
the
east
tuesday
july
morning
fine
and
warm
the
atmosphere
appears
very
different
here
to
what
it
did
amongst
the
mountains
the
evenings
and
nights
are
very
warm
and
pleasant
and
the
air
appears
pure
two
of
the
utah
indians
came
to
camp
early
this
morning
to
trade
two
ponies
were
bought
of
them
for
a
rifle
and
musket
these
two
are
but
of
moderate
size
pleasing
countenance
and
dressed
in
skins
at
half
past
eight
amasa
lyman
rodney
badger
roswell
stevens
and
brother
brannan
arrived
in
camp
they
report
that
the
pueblo
company
will
be
in
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
the
brethren
are
still
busy
plowing
and
planting
burr
frost
has
his
forge
up
and
quite
a
number
of
plows
have
been
rigged
up
by
the
assistance
of
the
carpenters
elder
lyman
i
understand
reports
that
they
heard
of
a
large
company
on
their
way
and
he
thinks
we
may
expect
them
in
or
days
elders
lyman
and
brannan
joined
the
exploring
party
with
president
young
and
kimball
and
the
company
started
off
soon
after
their
arrival
a
company
of
brethren
have
been
to
the
mountains
to
get
more
lumber
to
build
a
skiff
they
returned
this
evening
bringing
a
very
handsome
pine
log
about
twenty
inches
through
and
which
probably
when
whole
would
measure
sixty
feet
long
the
day
has
been
very
fine
and
warm
the
horses
and
cattle
seem
in
good
spirits
and
are
getting
fat
they
are
full
of
life
and
ambition
presidents
young
and
kimball
have
had
their
wagons
moved
a
little
distance
from
the
camp
to
the
other
side
the
creek
during
the
afternoon
two
more
indians
came
in
to
trade
some
of
the
brethren
are
making
unwise
trades
giving
twenty
charges
of
powder
and
balls
for
a
buck
skin
while
the
usual
price
is
three
charges
this
is
wrong
wednesday
july
morning
fine
and
warm
several
of
the
indians
have
remained
in
camp
over
night
they
seem
very
peaceable
and
gentle
and
anxious
to
trade
the
brethren
are
making
a
saw
pit
to
saw
lumber
for
a
skiff
joseph
hancock
and
lewis
barney
have
been
off
hunting
in
the
mountains
two
days
they
state
there
is
abundance
of
good
timber
for
building
in
the
mountains
but
difficult
to
get
at
it
the
timber
is
mostly
balsam
fir
and
poplar
and
many
sticks
will
make
two
good
logs
at
half
past
three
president
young
and
company
returned
they
have
been
at
the
salt
lake
and
report
it
to
be
about
miles
distance
no
water
after
they
leave
the
river
except
salt
water
the
lake
is
very
clear
and
the
water
heavy
so
much
so
that
a
man
can
not
possibly
sink
even
not
where
more
than
four
feet
deep
and
they
tried
to
fall
down
on
their
knees
but
could
not
touch
the
bottom
they
can
sit
or
lie
in
the
water
perfectly
easily
without
touching
the
bottom
one
of
the
brethren
lay
down
on
the
water
and
another
got
on
him
but
could
not
sink
him
they
suppose
the
water
will
yield
pure
salt
they
gathered
some
off
the
rocks
which
is
as
pure
white
and
fine
as
the
best
that
can
be
bought
in
market
there
is
a
cave
in
the
mountain
west
of
the
camp
which
is
sixty
feet
from
the
entrance
to
the
far
end
the
indians
appear
to
have
frequently
visited
it
and
there
are
yet
the
remains
of
their
fires
there
appears
to
be
no
fresh
water
beyond
the
river
and
the
brethren
are
more
and
more
satisfied
that
we
are
already
on
the
right
spot
at
eight
the
brethren
were
called
together
and
addressed
by
president
young
on
various
subjects
pointing
out
items
of
law
which
would
be
put
in
force
here
his
feelings
towards
the
gentiles
etc
he
said
they
intended
to
divide
the
city
into
blocks
of
ten
acres
each
with
eight
lots
in
a
block
of
one
and
a
quarter
acres
each
the
streets
to
be
wide
no
house
will
be
permitted
to
be
built
on
the
corners
of
the
streets
neither
petty
shops
each
house
will
have
to
be
built
so
many
feet
back
from
the
street
and
all
the
houses
parallel
with
each
other
the
fronts
are
to
be
beautified
with
fruit
trees
etc
no
filth
will
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
city
but
the
water
will
be
conducted
through
in
such
a
manner
as
to
carry
all
the
filth
off
to
the
river
jordan
no
man
will
be
suffered
to
cut
up
his
lot
and
sell
a
part
to
speculate
out
of
his
brethren
each
man
must
keep
his
lot
whole
for
the
lord
has
given
it
to
us
without
price
the
temple
lot
will
be
forty
acres
and
adorned
with
trees
ponds
etc
the
whole
subject
was
interesting
to
the
brethren
and
the
items
will
probably
be
given
more
fully
hereafter
the
twelve
were
appointed
a
committee
to
lay
off
the
city
etc

have
had
a
very
strong
cold
east
wind

in
sight

in
military
order
many
of
them

presidents
young
kimball
and
the
twelve
went
to
meet
the
brethren
and
met
them
in
the
canyon
they
report
that
they
had
very
heavy
rain
there
the
water
rising
in
the
creek
three
feet
in
a
very
short
time
caused
by
the
rush
from
the
mountains
the
brethren
arrived
at
the
lower
camp
at
half
past
three
and
marched
in
headed
by
the
fifes
and
side
drum
they
have
camped
a
little
west
of
the
other
camp
the
brethren
are
represented
as
feeling
well
and
cheerful
at
five
the
twelve
returned
here
and
an
hour
later
went
over
north
to
the
mountains
i
suppose

hold
a
council
friday
july
day
warm
twelve
held
a
council
with
the
officer
of
the
battalion
then
rode
up
to
the
hot
spring
evening
a
general
meeting
of
the
camp
and
addressed
by
president
young
he
told
his
feelings
concerning
the
soldiers
they
have
saved
the
people
by
going
when
required
etc
he
rejoiced
that
they
are
here
he
expressed
his
feelings
warmly
towards
the
brethren
and
also
told
his
feelings
towards
the
gentiles
the
meeting
was
opened
by
hosannas
three
times
and
closed
by
requesting
the
battalion
to
build
a
bower
tomorrow
on
the
temple
lot
where
we
can
assemble
for
meetings
etc
saturday
july
this
morning
the
brethren
commenced
making
the
bower
on
the
temple
lot
a
little
southwest
from
our
camp
they
will
make
it
about
forty
feet
long
and
feet
wide
walked
with
president
young
kimball
richards
and
others
to
the
mississippi
camp
brother
thomas
richardson
is
very
sick
and
several
others
of
the
soldiers
soloman
tindal
is
yet
alive
but
looks
feeble
elder
kimball
conversed
sometime
with
captain
james
brown
there
are
from
twenty
to
thirty
of
the
utah
indians
here
and
some
squaws
trading
with
the
brethren
they
are
generally
of
low
stature
pleasing
countenance
but
poorly
clad
while
we
were
there
a
dispute
arose
between
two
of
the
young
men
and
they
went
to
fighting
very
fiercely
one
broke
his
gun
stock
on
the
other
head
and
i
expected
to
see
a
pretty
serious
affray
many
of
the
others
gathering
around
soon
an
old
man
came
up
father
to
one
of
the
young
men
engaged
in
the
quarrel
and
he
used
his
heavy
whip
very
freely
about
both
their
heads
and
faces
the
antagonist
of
the
son
struck
the
old
man
and
he
immediately
gathered
a
long
pole
and
broke
it
over
the
young
head
he
succeeded
in
quelling
the
broil
and
gave
them
a
long
lecture
they
then
mostly
left
and
resumed
their
trading
a
little
distance
from
the
camp
in
the
afternoon
we
had
a
pretty
smart
thunder
shower
and
considerable
wind
in
the
evening
i
walked
down
to
the
pueblo
camp
and
there
learned
the
following
particulars
these
indians
who
are
now
here
are
of
the
shoshones
about
fifteen
or
twenty
in
number
and
several
women
among
them
there
were
four
or
five
of
the
utahs
here
this
morning
when
the
shoshones
came
up
one
of
the
utahs
had
stolen
a
horse
from
one
of
the
shoshones
and
the
latter
party
saw
him
with
the
horse
here
he
had
traded
the
horse
for
a
rifle
but
was
unwilling
either
to
give
up
the
horse
or
rifle
hence
the
quarrel
spoken
of
above
when
the
old
man
separated
them
the
thief
went
down
and
hid
himself
in
the
camp
below
soon
after
he
saw
another
horse
walking
by
which
he
knew
to
belong
to
the
shoshones
he
sprang
on
his
own
horse
and
drove
the
other
one
before
him
towards
the
mountains
on
the
southeast
as
hard
as
he
could
ride
the
shoshones
being
informed
of
it
four
of
them
started
in
pursuit
and
as
he
got
in
between
the
mountains
they
closed
in
on
him
one
of
the
pursuers
shooting
him
dead
while
another
one
shot
his
horse
they
returned
and
made
this
report
to
the
others
of
the
tribe
at
the
camp
at
the
same
time
exhibiting
fresh
blood
on
one
of
the
rifles
they
appear
to
be
much
excited
and
continually
on
the
watch
when
the
men
returned
they
sat
down
and
made
a
meal
of
some
of
these
large
crickets
they
appear
to
be
crisped
over
the
fire
which
is
all
the
cooking
required
many
of
the
brethren
have
traded
muskets
and
rifles
for
horses
and
ordinary
muskets
will
buy
a
pretty
good
horse
they
appear
to
be
displeased
because
we
have
traded
with
the
utahs
and
say
they
own
this
land
that
that
the
utahs
have
come
over
the
line
etc
they
signified
by
signs
that
they
wanted
to
sell
us
the
land
for
powder
and
lead
the
shoshones
are
poorer
clad
than
the
utahs
they
are
about
the
same
in
stature
and
there
are
many
pleasing
countenances
among
them
colonel
markham
reports
that
there
are
three
lots
of
land
already
broke
one
lot
of
acres
of
which
is
already
planted
with
buckwheat
corn
oats
etc
one
lot
of
eight
acres
which
is
all
planted
with
corn
potatoes
beans
etc
and
a
garden
of
ten
acres
four
acres
of
which
is
sown
with
garden
seed
he
says
there
are
about
three
acres
of
corn
already
up
about
two
inches
above
the
ground
and
some
beans
and
potatoes
up
too
this
is
the
result
of
eight
days
labor
besides
making
a
road
to
the
timber
hauling
and
sawing
timber
for
a
boat
making
and
repairing
plows
etc
there
have
been
thirteen
plows
and
three
harrows
worked
during
the
week
august
sunday
august
we
have
had
another
cool
windy
night
at
ten
in
the
morning
the
brethren
assembled
for
meeting
under
the
bower
on
the
temple
lot
all
the
members
of
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
being
present
except
president
young
who
is
quite
sick
again
after
the
meeting
had
been
opened
by
singing
and
prayer
by
elder
smith
elder
kimball
arose
and
made
some
remarks
to
the
following
effect
as
reported
by
brother
bullock
i
would
enquire
whether
there
is
a
guard
out
around
our
cattle
if
not
let
one
be
placed
immediately
the
indians
left
here
very
suddenly
this
morning
and
we
do
know
their
object
if
we
do
take
good
care
of
what
we
have
we
will
not
have
any
more
it
is
all
in
the
world
we
shall
ever
have
for
him
that
receiveth
i
will
give
more
we
are
the
sons
of
god
and
he
will
do
with
us
as
we
would
do
to
our
children
and
inasmuch
as
i
am
faithful
in
taking
care
of
my
neighbors
goods
i
shall
be
entitled
to
the
same
from
them
for
we
are
commanded
to
do
unto
others
as
we
want
others
to
do
to
us
every
penurious
man
who
takes
advantage
of
others
will
come
down
to
poverty
if
we
have
to
follow
the
steps
of
our
savior
we
have
to
follow
and
experience
the
same
things
you
will
have
to
feel
for
men
so
as
to
know
how
to
sympathize
with
them
and
then
you
can
feel
for
them
i
feel
for
this
people
and
grow
more
feeling
for
them
every
day
our
father
in
heaven
is
more
tender
to
us
than
any
mother
to
her
little
child
if
i
am
faithful
to
serve
others
others
will
be
willing
to
serve
me
orson
pratt
requested
the
prayers
of
the
saints
in
his
behalf
it
is
with
peculiar
feelings
that
i
arise
before
so
many
of
the
saints
in
this
uncultivated
region
inhabited
by
savages
my
mind
is
full
of
reflection
on
the
scenes
through
which
we
have
passed
and
being
brought
through
the
deserts
of
sage
to
this
distant
region
god
ways
are
not
as
our
ways
it
is
not
wisdom
that
the
saints
should
always
foresee
the
difficulties
they
have
to
encounter
for
then
they
would
not
be
trials
we
expected
some
revelations
to
take
place
and
behold
they
are
revealed
in
the
book
of
mormon
and
doctrine
and
covenants
for
we
are
to
congregate
among
the
remnants
of
joseph
we
did
think
our
wives
and
children
would
be
built
up
among
the
strongholds
of
the
gentiles
we
thought
we
should
be
as
missourians
to
them
jehovah
had
different
purposes
he
designed
that
this
people
should
be
brought
out
almost
as
an
entire
people
the
book
of
mormon
never
would
have
been
fulfilled
if
the
saints
had
not
left
the
gentiles
as
a
people
for
when
the
gentiles
rejected
the
gospel
it
was
to
be
taken
among
the
lamanites
so
long
as
the
gospel
the
priesthood
and
the
main
body
of
the
people
remained
with
them
the
fullness
of
the
gospel
was
not
taken
away
from
the
gentiles
this
movement
is
one
of
the
greatest
that
has
taken
place
among
this
people
i
feel
thankful
as
one
of
the
twelve
for
the
privilege
of
coming
out
as
one
of
the
pioneers
to
this
glorious
valley
where
we
can
build
up
a
city
to
the
lord
for
many
years
i
have
not
read
that
good
old
book
but
i
remember
the
predictions
in
it
and
some
that
are
now
very
nearly
fulfilled
by
us
isaiah
says
chapter
speaking
of
the
city
of
zion
it
shall
be
out
a
city
not
forsaken
etc
many
in
this
congregation
know
what
is
meant
by
the
garments
of
salvation
and
the
robe
of
righteousness
righteousness
and
praise
shall
spring
forth
before
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
and
they
will
not
hold
their
peace
there
are
many
of
you
that
feel
you
can
cry
day
and
night
to
the
people
in
the
cause
of
righteousness
until
it
shall
triumph
as
a
young
man
marrieth
a
virgin
this
belongs
and
refers
to
us
will
no
longer
give
thy
corn
to
be
meat
for
thine
enemy
this
has
not
been
fulfilled
heretofore
but
will
be
the
corn
that
we
toil
to
raise
from
the
earth
it
shall
not
be
given
to
our
enemies
they
that
gather
it
shall
eat
it
and
they
shall
drink
in
the
courts
of
his
holiness
this
wine
is
also
to
be
drunk
in
the
courts
of
the
lord
house
we
have
gathered
out
the
stones
out
of
the
road
and
thousands
will
yet
fulfil
this
prophecy
it
has
reference
to
the
latter
times
that
were
to
dawn
upon
the
world
in
the
last
dispensation
shalt
be
called
sought
out
a
city
not
forsaken
if
ever
there
was
a
place
sought
out
it
is
this
we
have
enquired
diligently
and
have
found
it
this
can
not
refer
to
jerusalem
but
to
this
very
place
point
and
spot
that
the
pioneers
have
found
where
a
city
shall
be
built
unto
the
lord
where
righteousness
will
reign
and
iniquity
not
be
allowed
isaiah
and
joel
both
spake
very
plainly
on
this
subject
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
last
days
that
the
house
of
the
lord
shall
be
established
etc
in
what
part
of
the
earth
could
it
be
established
more
than
in
this
place
where
this
congregation
is
gathered
in
the
midst
of
the
spires
of
the
mountains
we
have
found
a
place
large
enough
to
gather
a
few
thousand
of
the
saints
you
may
travel
europe
asia
africa
and
america
but
you
can
not
find
a
place
much
higher
where
any
people
can
raise
crops
and
sustain
themselves
the
house
of
the
lord
will
be
established
on
the
tops
of
the
mountains
when
we
shall
have
once
reared
here
the
experience
of
the
saints
proves
that
there
was
no
house
of
the
lord
and
we
can
say
travel
over
this
earth
but
you
can
not
find
the
house
of
the
lord
the
lord
must
give
the
pattern
of
the
building
and
order
it
and
give
directions
to
his
servants
the
lord
wants
his
house
built
precisely
to
the
pattern
that
he
gives
and
he
is
bound
to
speak
to
and
bless
and
make
them
his
own
children
in
that
house
and
i
verily
believe
i
shall
see
it
and
see
thousands
come
flocking
to
the
house
to
learn
the
way
of
salvation
and
i
want
to
see
the
time
that
i
shall
see
thousands
raising
their
voices
on
this
consecrated
land
there
are
many
testimonies
in
the
prophets
all
bearing
upon
this
subject
joseph
in
the
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
speaks
of
this
very
subject
and
it
appears
there
will
be
some
sinners
in
zion
who
will
be
afraid
and
a
devouring
fire
will
rest
upon
every
dwelling
place
in
zion
that
walketh
righteously
shall
dwell
on
high
bread
shall
be
given
him
his
water
shall
be
sure
isaiah
was
on
the
eastern
continent
when
he
spoke
this
and
was
speaking
of
a
very
distant
place
it
will
be
pretty
difficult
to
get
a
ship
of
war
up
to
this
place
when
we
get
used
to
this
healthy
climate
the
people
will
not
say
i
am
sick
but
will
be
able
to
smite
the
gentiles
they
will
grow
up
strong
and
will
not
be
in
jeopardy
from
sickness
the
wilderness
shall
become
as
a
fruitful
field
and
a
fruitful
field
as
a
forest
we
know
the
time
will
come
that
the
great
jehovah
will
cause
springs
of
water
to
gush
out
of
the
desert
lands
and
we
shall
see
the
lands
survive
that
the
gentiles
have
defiled
isaiah
speaks
of
the
heritage
of
jacob
being
in
a
high
place
this
is
about
four
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
the
high
mountains
will
still
catch
the
hail
and
we
shall
be
in
a
low
place
we
will
not
feel
discouraged
but
will
feel
full
of
vigor
and
circumscribe
all
things
to
the
very
heavens
for
this
is
what
we
desire
above
all
things
let
us
endeavor
to
covenant
in
our
hearts
that
we
will
serve
the
lord
that
we
will
keep
his
commandments
and
obey
his
counsel
i
wish
that
all
of
us
should
be
faithful
and
as
president
young
said
the
other
evening
every
man
is
expected
to
do
his
duty
the
lord
will
be
with
us
still
he
will
shield
guard
and
defend
us
by
day
and
be
our
refuge
by
night
and
our
salvation
i
feel
to
say
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
you
shall
be
blest
if
you
keep
the
commandments
of
god
amen
elder
kimball
hopes
the
brethren
will
be
attentive
to
what
they
hear
for
if
you
bring
an
evil
upon
this
people
you
will
bring
destruction
upon
yourself
if
you
do
things
according
to
counsel
and
they
are
wrong
the
consequences
will
fall
on
the
heads
of
those
who
counseled
you
so
do
be
troubled
i
do
not
want
to
be
wrapt
in
the
skins
of
some
men
who
have
taken
a
course
that
has
brought
destruction
upon
themselves
and
others
and
they
will
have
to
answer
for
it
i
am
a
man
that
would
not
speak
to
a
man
daughter
to
marry
her
until
i
have
first
spoken
to
her
father
and
mother
also
and
then
it
is
done
by
common
consent
but
i
preach
the
truth
every
word
of
it
president
young
instructed
the
battalion
last
evening
and
counseled
them
for
their
comfort
and
the
counsel
is
for
the
brethren
to
keep
their
guns
and
their
powder
and
their
balls
and
lead
and
not
let
the
indians
have
it
for
they
will
shoot
down
our
cattle
they
stole
guns
yesterday
and
had
them
under
their
blankets
and
if
you
do
attend
to
this
you
are
heating
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
to
scald
your
own
feet
if
you
listen
to
counsel
you
will
let
them
alone
and
let
them
eat
the
crickets
there
a
plenty
of
them
i
understand
they
offered
to
sell
the
land
and
we
were
to
buy
it
of
them
the
utahs
would
want
to
pay
for
it
too
the
land
belongs
to
our
father
in
heaven
and
we
calculate
to
plow
and
plant
it
and
no
man
will
have
power
to
sell
his
inheritance
for
he
can
not
remove
it
it
belongs
to
the
lord
i
am
glad
i
have
come
to
a
place
where
i
feel
free
i
am
satisfied
and
we
are
in
a
goodly
land
my
family
is
back
my
teams
are
helping
on
several
families
and
leaving
ours
if
my
family
were
here
i
would
not
go
over
that
road
again
i
believe
in
brother
joseph
religion
which
he
said
was
a
key
that
would
save
every
man
or
woman
and
that
it
is
for
every
man
to
mind
his
own
business
and
let
other
people
business
alone
we
will
all
have
farms
and
cultivate
them
and
plant
vineyards
and
if
we
are
faithful
five
years
will
not
pass
away
before
we
are
better
off
than
we
ever
were
in
nauvoo
if
we
had
brought
our
families
along
everybody
else
would
have
come
and
we
must
lose
another
year
we
could
not
bring
all
the
soldiers
families
for
the
same
reason
that
we
did
not
bring
our
own
families
i
thank
the
lord
that
there
are
so
many
of
the
soldiers
here
if
they
had
tarried
in
winter
quarters
there
would
have
been
many
more
deaths
among
them
we
brought
many
of
these
pioneers
to
save
their
lives
many
of
them
were
very
sick
and
were
carried
out
of
their
beds
and
put
into
the
wagons
they
have
mostly
recovered
their
health
and
we
have
been
prosperous
and
have
been
permitted
to
arrive
here
alive
there
has
not
one
died
on
the
journey
nor
an
ox
nor
horse
nor
anything
except
one
of
brother
crow
oxen
which
was
poisoned
we
lost
several
horses
by
accident
and
we
shall
be
prosperous
on
our
journey
back
again
if
we
are
faithful
those
of
us
who
go
and
we
shall
see
and
enjoy
the
society
of
our
families
again
we
will
one
day
have
a
house
built
here
and
have
the
forts
and
go
into
the
house
and
administer
for
our
dead

by
uplifted

was
followed
by
remarks
by
elder
amasa
lyman
mostly
sustaining
the
positions
taken
by
the
previous
speakers
elder

again
rose
to
lay
before
the
brethren
some
items
of
business
whereupon
it
was
decided
that
the
three
companies
form
into
one
camp
and
labor
together

the

be
a

to
form
the
corral
and
that
the
corral
be
formed
tomorrow
that
horses
and
mules
be
tied
near
the
camp
at
nights
that
we
build
houses
instead
of
living
in
wagons
this
winter
that
we
go
to
work
immediately
putting
up
houses
that
we
work
unitedly
that
the
houses
form
a
stockade
or
fort
to
keep
out
the
indians
that
our
women
and
children
be
not
abused
and
that
we
let
the
indians
alone

adobe
houses
to
hasten
the

that
inasmuch
as
timber
is
scarce
and
we
have
spades
and
shovels
and
tools
enough
as
many
as
can
be
used
he
is
in

building
adobe
houses
and
saving
the
timber
lieutenant
willis
said
you
can
put
up
an
adobe
house
before
a
man

moving
their

up
and
we
also
moved
a
little
farther
east
during
the

the

was
formed
in
an
oblong

about

who
is
pleased
with
our
situation
we
have
commenced
the
survey
of
a
city

feel
that
the
time
is
fast
approaching
when
those
teams
that
are
going
to
winter
quarters
this
fall
should
be
on
the
way
every
individual
here
would
be
glad
to
tarry
if
his
friends
were
here
but
as
many
of
the
battalion
as
well
as
the
pioneers
have
not
their
families
here
and
do
not
expect
that
they
are
in
your

any

will
see
us
before
you
see
our
valley
let
all
the
brethren
and
sisters
cheer
up
their

until
the

could
be
tested
by
a
standard
pole
which
will
have
to
be
gotten
from
the
mountains
some

been
very
warm
but
the
nights
begin
to
be
very
cool
the
northeast
winds
seem
to
prevail
here
at
this

and
coming
from
the

are
cold
when
the
sun
is
down

wants
me
to
start
with
the
ox
teams
next
monday
so
as
to
have
a
better
privilege
of
taking
the

etc
he
calculates
the
horse
teams
to
start
two
weeks
later
and
if
the

at
grand
island
before
the

morning
fine
but
cool
elder
carrington
starts
for
the
mountains
to
look
for
limestone
during
the
day
i
went
and
bathed
at
bathing
place
in
one
of
the
warm
sulphur
springs
i
found
the
effects
very
refreshing
and
beneficial
spent
most
of
the
day
making
a
table
of
distances
etc
the
day
very
hot
wednesday
august
this
morning
william
a
king
has
commenced
making
a
new
roadometer
the
day
very
hot
and
close
thursday

again
at
the
roadometer
day
very
warm
little
and
others
have
returned
and
report
that
they
have
been
at
the
utah
lake
as
they
went
up
they
saw
bodies
of
two
dead
indians
lying
on
the
ground
proving
that
there
was
one
of
each
tribe
killed
the
other
day
they
consider
it
to
be
about
forty
miles
to
the
utah
lake
and
on
the
east
side
is
a
handsome
valley
about
six
or
eight
miles
wide
they
are
now
convinced
that
the
stream
which
runs
a
few
miles
below
here
is
the
utah
outlet
they
having
followed
it
to
its
junction
with
the
lake
friday
august
the

very
warm
saturday
august
today
william
a
king
has
finished
the
roadometer
which
will
now
tell
the
distance
for
one
thousand
miles
without
keeping
any
account
about
noon
a
very
large
whirlwind
struck
the
south
side
of
the
camp
forming
a
cloud
of
dust
about
twenty
feet
in
diameter
and
making
a
loud
roar
it
carried
a
chicken
up
some
distance
tore
up
the
bowers
and
shook
the
wagons
violently
in
its
course
it
passed
off
to
the
northeast
and
seemed
to
break
at
the
mountains
this
morning
fifteen
of
the
brethren
commenced
building
a
dam
a
little
above
the
camp
so
as
to
bring
the
water
around
and
inside
the
camp
they
finished
early
in
the
afternoon
and
we
have
now
a
pleasant
little
stream
of
cold
water
running
on
each
side
the
wagons
all
around
the
camp
where
the
water
runs
off
or
overflows
the
gutters
it
soon
becomes
miry
and
cattle
will
sink
a
half
a
yard
in
mud
this
is
owing
to
the
lightness
of
the
soil
it
being
very
light
and
rich
in
the
evening
many
of
the
brethren
went
and
were
baptized

i
have
received
from
elder
kimball
a
pair
of
buckskin
pants
as
a
present
i
suppose

have
on

occasions
been
branded
with
the
idea
of
receiving
a
great
many
kindnesses
without
consideration
i
will
for
this
once
state
a
little
particular
on
the
other
side

that
i
have
had
the
privilege
of
riding
in
a
wagon
and
sleeping
in
it
of

victuals
cooked
and
some
meat
and
milk
and
occasionally
a

have
had
no
team
to
take
care
of
howard
egan

done
most
of
my
washing
until
a
month
ago
in
consideration
of
the
privilege
of
copying
from
my
journal
using
my
desk
ink
etc
the

matter
on
an
average
of

has
been
for
his
special
benefit
i

furnished
by

might
enjoy
this
journey
as
a
mission
of
pleasure

of
this
spot

wednesday
august
early
this
morning
a
large
company
of
the
utah
indians
came
to
visit
the
camp
and
it
was
with
difficulty
they
could
be
kept
outside
the
wagons
there
are
few
of
them
who
have
any
clothing
on
except
the
breech
clout
and
are
mostly
of
low
stature
they
have
scarcely
anything
to
trade
and
not
many
women
and
children
with
them
they
are
camped
about
three
miles
north
of
west
and
supposed
to
be
going
north
hunting
one
of
them
was
detected
stealing
some
clothing
which
lay
on
the
bushes
to
dry
but
was
made
to
leave
it
when
they
found
they
were
not
permitted
inside
the
circle
they
soon
moved
off
to
their
camp
the
brethren
have
commenced
laying
the
adobe
wall
today
which
will
be
inches
thick
and
nine
feet
high
the
adobes
are
inches
long
inches
broad
and
inches
thick
the
brethren
in
camp
have
finished
the
skiff
and
launched
her
in
the

to
soak
about
five
a
child
of
therlkill
was
found
in
the
creek
south
of
the
camp
drowned
various
efforts
were
made
to
restore
it
but
unsuccessfully
the
child
was
about
three
years
old
and
its
parents
mourn
the
accident
bitterly

day
has
been
very
hot

getting
dissatisfied
at
being
kept
here
so
long
from
their
families
and
yesterday
several
of
them
left
the
camp
secretly
to
go
to
winter
quarters
and
this
morning
others
are
gone

it
is
probable
that

about
a
dozen

a
little
rain
this
morning

the
air
very
cool
we
started
at

found
the
road
rough
indeed
when
ascending
the
mountain
from
brown
creek
most
of
the
teams
had
to
double
it
generally
requiring
six
yoke
of
oxen
to
bring
up
an
empty
wagon
the
descent
is
also
very
rough
and
especially
where
the
road
crosses
the
dry
creek
which
is
a
great
many
times
canyon
creek
appeared
rougher
than
when
we
first
went
up
it
and
it
took
till
near
night
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
creek
having
traveled
only
fifteen
and
three
quarters
miles
during
the
day
thursday

we
got
started
again
about
all
except
chas

one
of

oxen
was
missing

several
of
the
loose
cattle
gave
out

over
driven

camped
on
red
mountain

a
half
miles

buckets
at
the
oil
spring
we
followed
a
wagon
trail
made
by
a
part
of
company
last
year
about
a
mile
and
found
the
spring
situated
in
a
ravine
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
road
just
at
the
edge
of
a
high
bench
of
land
the
ground
is
black
over
with
the
oil
for
several
rods
but
it
is
baked
hard
by
exposure
to
the
sun
it
is
difficult
to
get
the
clear
oil
most
of
it
being
filled
with
dust
and
gravel
it
smells
much
like
british
oil
and
is
said
to
do
well
for
greasing
wagons
john
gleason
has
found
a
coal
bed
in
the
edge
of
the
mountain
across
the
creek
the
coal
looks
good
and
burns
freely

cloudy

much
eaten
off

only
stayed
an
hour
and
a
half
while
some
of
the
brethren
traded
some

camped
on
a
stream
two

a
half
miles
the

very
cool

strayed
several
miles
from

it
is
yet
about
sixteen
miles
from
water
to
water
thursday
august

went
on
to
the
big

up
with
letters
from
the
companies
they
say
there
are
nine
companies
between
here

the
platte
with
wagons
and
about
head

tolerably
fast
some

a
large
party
of
mounted
indians
came
up

river
they
have
been
on
the
sweet
water
hunting
and
are
said
to
be
of
the

tribe
friday
august
many
of
the
brethren
traded
sugar
powder
lead
to
the
indians
for
robes
and
skins
and
meat
we
started
soon
after
seven
and
traveled
to
the
crossing
of
the
big
sandy
then
after
halting
an
hour
continued
to
the
little
sandy
making
and
a
quarter
miles
today
but
it
was
nine
before
some
of
the
wagons
arrived
the
feed
is
mostly
eaten
up
on
the
creeks
near
the
road
and
there
is
none
except
on
the
banks
of
streams
bailey
jacobs
killed
a
large
antelope
which
is
a
matter
of
rejoicing
as
we
are
nearly
out
of
bread
stuff
and
had
little
meat
for
several
days
we
started
back
from
the
valley
with
lbs
of
flour
lbs
of
meal
and
a
few
beans
each
and
we
have
to
depend
on
getting
meat
on
the
road
for
the
rest
i
was
told
there
were
lbs
of
flour
put
up
for
me
but
i
find
it
is
not
so
saturday
august
started
at
eight
and
traveled
till
half
past
three
before
halting
when
we
arrived
at
the
crossing
of
the
pacific
creek
and
halted
to
camp
for
the
night
having
traveled
miles
there
is
no
grass
from
little
sandy
to
this
place
except
a
very
little
on
dry
sandy
but
the
water
there
has
some
taste
of
alkali
and
teams
do
not
like
it
here
there
is
considerable
grass
along
the
creek
and
very
good
water
but
no
wood
except
wild
sage
we
had
a
heavy
thunder
shower
about
four
and
considerable
hail
it
was
dark
before
the
ox
teams
arrived
some
of
the
men
had
killed
a
buffalo
a
few
miles
back
but
it
is
very
poor
sunday
august
it
was
decided
to
remain
here
today
to
rest
the
teams
but
our
ten
obtained
leave
to
go
on
to
sweet
water
expecting
to
meet
the
company
and
after
reading
the
letter
of
instructions
from
the
council
to
this
camp
my
wagon
proceeded
on
slowly
at
the
springs
we
saw
an
aged
indian
squaw
near
the
road
dwelling
in
a
shelter
composed
merely
of
wild
sage
and
apparently
dependent
on
passing
emigrants
for
subsistence
she
is
doubtless
left
to
perish
on
account
of
age
and
infirmity
but
it
is
likely
she
will
live
some
time
on
what
she
receives
from
those
who
pass
by
when
we
arrived
near
the
summit
of
the
dividing
ridge
or
south
pass
two
indians
rode
towards
us
and
motioned
for
us
to
stop
not
seeing
the
other
wagons
coming
after
we
stopped
to
wait
for
the
wagons
and
the
indians
soon
arrived
they
made
signs
that
a
large
party
of
them
were
over
the
mountain
north
and
they
wanted
to
swap
while
they
were
conversing
a
number
more
rode
over
the
ridge
and
soon
after
a
still
larger
number
about
this
time
the
wagons
came
in
sight
and
when
the
brethren
saw
so
many
indians
they
were
alarmed
john
pack
rode
back
to
the
main
camp
to
get
some
of
the
brethren
to
come
up
but
said
he
would
not
budge
a
foot
the
brethren
behind
were
much
alarmed
some
expecting
to
be
scalped
and
one
carr
ran
and
hid
himself
in
the
sage
bushes
no
one
returned
with
john
pack
but
norman
taylor
and
the
wagons
proceeded
towards
us
in
the
meantime
after
learning
the
object
for
which
the
indians
sought
us
that
none
of
them
were
armed
except
two
and
by
a
certificate
that
the
first
visitor
was
a
shoshone
chief
brother
lamb
and
myself
signified
that
we
would
trade
with
them
and
soon
some
of
them
returned
with
antelope
buck
and
elk
skins
and
robes
to
trade
i
traded
some
balls
and
a
little
powder
for
one
robe
one
elk
skin
two
buckskins
and
nine
antelope
skins
and
a
pair
of
moccasins
lamb
bought
five
antelope
skins
while
we
were
trading
the
other
wagons
arrived
and
also
commenced
trading
the
indians
about
sixty
in
number
about
twenty
of
them
boys
all
mounted
seemed
highly
pleased
to
trade
with
us
which
we
did
mostly
through
the
chief
by
request
of
the
chief
i
gave
him
a
certificate
stating
that
he
appeared
friendly
and
wanted
to
trade
with
the
whites
etc
the
chief
gave
us
a
very
strong
invitation
to
go
to
their
camp
to
trade
and
made
signs
that
they
would
feed
us
well
and
we
should
sleep
with
them
i
answered
him
by
signs
that
we
should
camp
when
we
arrived
where
the
road
crossed
the
sweet
water
but
they
were
very
anxious
to
have
us
then
turn
off
the
road
and
camp
after
we
started
the
chief
came
up
and
wanted
to
swap
a
good
mule
for
my
spy
glass
but
i
refused
i
had
let
him
look
through
it
and
he
seemed
very
wishful
to
try
it
when
they
saw
we
were
determined
to
go
on
they
left
us
and
returned
to
their
camp

have
lost
many
cattle

so
bad
off
for
teams
as
not
to
be
able
to
travel
more
than
ten
miles
a
day
which
would
make
it
some
day
in

before

company
saturday

we
started

very
sandy
road
till

then
camped
on
ravine
creek
having
traveled
sixteen
miles
sunday
september
there
being
alkali
springs
near
we
concluded
to
go
to
independence
rock
at
which
place
we
arrived
about
three
having
traveled
twelve
and
a
half
miles
soon
after
we
camped
lamb
and
jacob
cloward
went
to
chase
some
buffalo
and
succeeded
in
killing
one
i
walked
over
the
rock
and
had
some
solemn
meditations
and
felt
to
humble
myself
and
call
upon
the
lord
for
myself
and
family
for
this
company
the
twelve
and
all
the
companies
on
the
road
experience
has
taught
me
many
maxims
of
late
and
i
intend
to
profit
by
them
be
not
hasty
to
promise
lest
thy
promise
be
considered
worthless
make
not
many
promises
without
reflection
lest
thou
fail
to
fulfill
them
and
it
dampen
the
confidence
of
thy
friend
if
thou
promise
many
things
and
regard
not
to
fulfill
them
and
it
damp
the
confidence
of
thy
friend
then
be
assured
that
thy
friends
will
despise
thy
promises
and
have
no
dependence
in
them
seek
not
to
speculate
out
of
a
good
brother
monday
september
this
morning
the
cattle
were
found
down
the
sweet
water
about
six
miles
from
camp
which
made
it
late
before
we
started
while
passing
the
alkali
lakes
a
number
of
the
brethren
filled
the
bags
with
saleratus
we
found
the
road
very
sandy
to
greasewood
creek
and
after
that
it
was
somewhat
better
about
three
the
wind
began
to
blow
very
strong
and
cold
and
we
had
heavy
rain
for
about
two
hours
we
proceeded
on
and
arrived
at
the
willow
spring
a
little
before
dark
in
the
midst
of
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
thomas
cloward
left
one
of
the
old
oxen
sent
back
by
wallace
on
the
road
it
died
before
morning
all
except
our
ten
and
william
stayed
back
at
greasewood
creek
we
tried
in
vain
to
make
a
fire
but
finally
went
to
bed
wet
and
cold
having
eaten
nothing
since
morning
some
of
the
teamsters
have
only
a
light
summer
coat
with
them
and
they
suffer
considerably
we
traveled
and
a
half
miles
today
tuesday
september
this
morning
our
cattle
were
all
missing
and
it
still
rains
and
snows
very
heavily
pack
and
cloward
started
early
on
foot
to
hunt
the
cattle
but
after
following
them
over
seven
miles
in
the
storm
and
seeing
that
they
had
kept
on
the
road
towards
the
platte
river
they
returned
to
camp
it
rained
and
snowed
heavily
till
eleven
at
which
time
the
balance
of
the
camp
arrived
john
pack
asked
the
company
to
let
us
have
some
of
their
loose
cattle
to
bring
on
our
wagons
till
we
overtook
ours
again
but
the
captains
both
generously
refused
for
some
cause
or
other
however
some
of
the
brethren
took
their
cattle
out
of
their
teams
and
let
us
have
them
and
we
moved
onward
after
traveling
about
thirteen
miles
we
saw
our
cattle
about
four
miles
to
the
left
of
the
road
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
we
halted
and
lamb
took
one
of
the
mules
to
fetch
the
cattle
to
the
road
soon
after
pack
and
jackson
redding
came
up
and
learning
that
we
had
found
the
cattle
they
started
to
them
to
drive
them
to
camp
and
lamb
being
relieved
returned
to
the
wagon
we
harnessed
up
and
arrived
at
the
mineral
spring
about
six
having
traveled
sixteen
and
a
quarter
miles
this
spring
has
been
represented
as
poisonous
but
if
it
is
so
it
must
be
in
consequence
of
minerals
under
the
water
the
water
has
no
bad
taste
till
the
cattle
trample
in
it
it
then
becomes
almost
black
as
ink
and
this
is
probably
what
makes
it
poisonous
wednesday
september
we
started
at
eight
and
arrived
at
the
upper
platte
ferry
soon
after
twelve
we
found
jacobs
and

there
hunting

forded
the
river
and
found
it
about
two
feet
deep
in
the
channel
we
halted
on
the
banks
about
two
hours
at
which
time
the
whole
camp
arrived
we
then
proceeded
on
the
main
company
went
about
five
miles
but
we
went
till
we
found
a
good
camping
place
in
a
grove
of
timber
on
the
banks
of
the
river
where
the
road
runs
through
then

night
having
traveled
nineteen
miles
thursday

this
morning
norton
jacob
company

up
by
the
other
companies

wet
weather

strong
southwest
wind
all

cool
we
started
a
little
before

and
had
good
traveling

many
herds
of
buffalo
but
the
hunters
did
not
get
any
while

arrived
at
the

a
la
perle
at

and
camped
for
the

and
a
half

a
while

some
of
the

came
in
with
a
part
of
a
buffalo
which
they
killed
lewis
barney
also
killed
a
young
one
which
was
considerably
fat
the
meat
was
all
packed
in
on
horses
one
of
the
men
killed
a
wolf
out
of
which
we
got
considerable
grease
for
the
wagons
it
was
decided
to
have
a
guard
each
night
the
remainder
of
the
journey
every
man
to
stand
in
his
turn
four
each
night
saturday

and
stood
guard
till
daylight
the
morning
very
fine
and
pleasant
three
of
the
brethren
arrived
from
the
camp
back
and
said
that
during
the
night
before
last
the
indians
had
stolen
sixteen
or
seventeen
of
their
horses
and
they
were
in
pursuit
of
them
we
were
detained
some
on
account
of
several
of
the
horses
having
rambled
off
but
about
nine
we
started
on
and
traveled
to
the
la
bonte
river
distance
nineteen
and
a
half
miles
there
are
many
buffalo
around
here
also
and
although
we
have
plenty
of
meat
the
brethren
continue
to
kill
them
we
find
the
feed
eaten
off
bare
almost
every
place
we
come
to
and
it
is
difficult
to
find
grass
to
sustain
our
teams
sunday
september
we
traveled
this
day
seventeen
and
three
quarters
miles
and
camped
by
heber
spring

ceased
running
but
there
was
water
in
the
creek
a
little
north
the
roadometer
has
broken
down
today
over
the
same
ground
it
broke
as
we
went
west
our
bread
stuff
is
now
out
and
we
have
to
live
solely
on
meat
the
balance
of
the
journey
john
pack
has
got
flour
enough
to
last
him
through
we
have
all
messed
together
until
ours
was
eaten
and
now
john
pack
proposes
for
each
man
to
mess
by
himself
he
has
concealed
his
flour
and
beans
together
with
tea
coffee
sugar
and
cooks
after
the
rest
have
gone
to
bed
such
things
seem
worthy
of
remembrance
for
a
time
to
come
monday
september
we
fixed
the
roadometer
this
morning
then
traveled
to
dead
timber

plenty
of
wood
and
water
tuesday
september
started
at
nine
and
traveled
till
about
five
then
camped
on
the
platte
river
having
traveled
and
a
quarter
miles
in
consequence
of
some
things
which
have
passed
and
some
which
at
present
exist
i
have
concluded
to
go
on
as
fast
as
circumstances
will
permit
to
winter
quarters
and
i
intend
to
start
tomorrow
some
have
opposed
it
but
not
with
a
good
grace
however
i
have
no
fears
that
the
council
will
censure
me
when
they
know
the
cause
if
they
do
i
will
bear
the
censure
in
preference
to
what
i
now
bear
before
dark
luke
johnson
william
empey
and
appleton
harmon
came
up
from
laramie
having
learned
from

a
party
of
sioux
warriors
have
got
the
brethren
horses
seventeen
in
number
on
the
raw
hide
about
eighteen
miles
north
they
say
that
about
fifty
armed
men
might
go
and
probably
get
them
but
not
fewer
the
sioux
are
at
war
with
the
crows
and
pawnees
and
reports
say
that
there
is
a
large
party
of
the
pawnees
a
little
down
the
river
wednesday

little
after

having
traveled
and
a
quarter
miles
over
very
sandy
road
the
ox
teams
have
kept
nearly
up
with
us
and
it
is
evident
they
intend
to
keep
with
us
or
kill
their
teams
and
being
aware
that
if
the
teams
are
injured
we
shall
be
blamed
for
it
we
have
given
up
going
ahead
to
save
the
teams

three
quarters

very
good
saturday

last
night
john
pack
gray
horse
was
stolen
from
his
wagon
he
lays
it
to
the
brethren
ahead
and
with
norton
jacobs
and
joseph
hancock
has
heaped
a
pretty
long
string
of
severe
abusive
language
on
them
which
i
consider
to
be
premature
unjustifiable
and
wicked
two
frenchmen
came
to
the
camp
and
said
they
were
camped
below
on
a
trading
excursion
among
the
sioux
inasmuch
as
some
of
the
brethren
wanted
to
trade
with
them
it
was
concluded
to

accordingly
traveled
four
and
a
quarter

on
the
banks
of
the
river

the
brethren
bought
a
number
of
buffalo

etc
norton
jacobs
bought
five
robes

seven
common
calico

the
river
today
to
where
there
are
plenty
of
buffalo
our
camp
also
traveled
ten
and
three
quarters
miles
and
camped
a
little
below
chimney
rock
there
are
many
herds
of
buffalo
around
and
lewis
barney
killed
one
which
will
give
us
a
little
fresh
meat
the
weather

been
very
fine
and
warm
for
some
days

some
signs
of
stormy
weather
monday
september
today
we
traveled
seven
and
a
quarter
miles
the
day
very
hot
we
turned
off
the
road
to
camp
at
rubidoos
request
while
they
killed
some
buffalo
they
gave
us
some
very
nice
meat
tuesday
september
we
have
concluded
to
wait
here
until
the
balance
of
the
company
arrives
afternoon
went
over
the
river
and
had
a
good
feast
on
buffalo
ribs
with
the
frenchmen
the
victuals
were
cooked
by
a
squaw
but
looked
much
cleaner
than
our
men
cook
it
evening
it
became
cloudy
and
soon
followed
by
cold
rain
which
continued
till
two
wednesday
september
at
one
i
got
up
to
stand
guard
and
found
the
night
extremely
cold
and
unpleasant
on
account
of
rain
the
morning
is
cloudy
and
cold
the
wagons
have
not
yet
come
in
sight
which
makes
us
think
there
is
something
the
matter
with
them
thursday
september
today
jackson
redding
and
sanderson
went
back
to
see
if
they
could
see
the
other
wagons
they
returned
at
night
and
said
the
company
were
within
a
few
miles
having
been
detained
at
laramie
to
recover
their
horses
most
of
which
they
got
they
state
that
news
has
come
to
the
fort
by
a
sioux
indian
that
the
twelve
and
their
company
had
all
their
horses
stolen
at
the
pacific
springs
during
a
snow
storm
the
sioux
stole
them
supposing
them
to
belong
to
the
shoshones
the
man
that
brought
the
news
stole
seventeen
but
lost
eight
in
the
mountains
the
remainder
he
brought
to
laramie
and
the
brethren
there
knew
some
of
them
and
demanded
them
he
gave
them
up
at
least
all
they
could
prove
and
four
of
the
brethren
started
with
them
to
meet
the
twelve
the
indian
says
there
were
nine
of
them
who
stole
the
horses
friday
september
we
resumed
our
journey
this
morning
and
traveled
thirteen
and
a
half
miles
then
camped
where
the
road
runs
close
to
the
river
the
weather
is
again
fine
and
hot
in
the
day
time
but
the
nights
are
cold
and
frosty
joseph
hancock
killed
a
buffalo
cow
and
john
norton
an
antelope
which
will
supply
the
company
with
a
little
meat
each
most
of
whom
are
without
saturday
september
the
day
cloudy
and
some
like
for
a
storm
we
made
an
early
start
and
traveled
to
crab
creek
distance
twenty
and
a
quarter
miles
then
camped
for
the
night
the
land
on
both
sides
the
river
is
literally
spotted
with
vast
herds
of
buffalo
but
our
hunters
are
not
very
lucky
as
yet
from
the
fact
of
there
being
so
many
buffalo
in
this
region
we
are
inclined
to
believe
we
shall
see
but
few
lower
down
and
this
is
probably
the
best
chance
we
will
have
to
lay
in
a
supply
to
last
us
home
during
the
afternoon
joseph
hancock
killed
a
buffalo
cow
and
captain
rappleyee
sent
a
wagon
to
fetch
the
meat
to
camp
when
it
arrived
john
pack
took
the
hind
quarters
and
the
best
meat
off
the
rest
of
the
cow
together
with
all
the
tallow
then
sent
for
rappleyee
to
take
what
he
had
left
and
divide
it
amongst
the
company
when
rappleyee
saw
what
he
had
done
he
felt
angry
and
pack
and
he
had
some
high
words
on
the
subject
brother
pack
conduct
has
caused
many
unpleasant
feelings
against
him
among
the
brethren
he
takes
all
the
tallow
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
and
all
the
best
meat
and
has
now
got
more
than
will
serve
him
home
while
many
of
the
rest
have
scarcely
any
and
that
of
the
poorest
pieces
he
has
plenty
of
flour
meal
beans
tea
coffee
sugar
while
most
of
the
camp
are
destitute
of
everything
but
meat
and
while
he
continues
to
take
the
tallow
and
best
of
the
meat
there
will
be
hard
feelings
against
him
he
has
disgraced
himself
in
the
estimation
of
many
within
the
past
few
days
i
do
not
think
i
can
ever
forget
him
for
his
treatment
of
me
but
i
cherish
no
malice
nor
feelings
of
revenge
but
i
hope
and
pray
that
i
may
forever
have
wisdom
to
keep
from
under
his
power
there
have
been
six
or
eight
buffalo
killed
by
the
camp
and
it
is
intended
to
stay
here
tomorrow
and
try
to
get
meat
to
last
us
through
as
it
is
not
likely
we
shall
have
another
privilege
as
good
as
this
most
of
the
camp
now
begin
to
feel
that
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
make
our
way
home
as
fast
as
possible
to
save
our
teams
and
escape
the
cold
rain
and
snowstorms
sunday
september
many
of
the
brethren
are
gone
out
hunting
the
weather
continues
fine
and
warm
in
the
afternoon
we
had
a
strong
northwest
wind
during
the
day
the
second
division
killed
more
than
enough
meat
to
last
them
home
but
were
totally
unwilling
to
let
the
first
division
have
any
although
they
killed
none
not
having
but
two
or
three
guns
in
the
division
this
also
has
tended
to
increase
the
feeling
of
envy
and
bitterness
which
already
exists
too
much
thomas
cloward
has
manifested
feelings
and
conduct
worse
than
the
general
run
of
gentiles
and
unworthy
of
a
saint
he
seems
to
have
drunk
into
pack
spirit
for
they
act
very
much
alike
monday
september
those
of
the
first
division
who
have
no
meat
have
concluded
to
move
on
a
few
miles
to
where
there
are
more
buffalo
as
they
have
mostly
left
here
but
the
second
division
will
not
move
till
they
have
dried
their
meat
some
we
went
on
three
miles
and
then
camped
where
there
are
plenty
of
buffalo
over
the
river
lisbon
lamb
lewis
barney
and
john
norton
volunteered
to
go
and
kill
what
meat
they
can
for
those
who
have
none
they
have
got
enough
to
last
them
through
it
is
said
that
our
coming
down
here
has
given
feelings
but
it
is
plain
and
evident
that
there
are
several
men
who
will
find
fault
and
deal
out
wholesale
censure
whatever
is
done
and
for
my
part
i
shall
remember
john
pack
thomas
cloward
norton
jacobs
and
joseph
hancock
for
some
time
to
come
such
little
selfish
unmanly
conduct
as
has
been
manifested
by
them
is
rarely
exhibited
except
by
the
meanest
classes
of
society
a
man
who
will
openly
and
boldly
steal
is
honorable
when
compared
with
some
of
their
underhanded
conduct
during
the
day
the
brethren
killed
five
cows
and
one
bull
which
are
considered
sufficient
to
last
the
first
division
home
tuesday
september
we
waited
till
after
nine
for
the
second
division
to
come
up
but
not
being
yet
in
sight
we
moved
onward
traveled
seventeen
and
a
half
miles
then
camped
on
sand
hill
creek
about
a
mile
from
the
river
we
have
seen
more
buffalo
today
than
i
ever
saw
in
one
day
supposed
to
be
not
less
than
we
had
some
trouble
to
make
a
road
through
them
safely
we
also
saw
two
horses
with
the
herd
jackson
redding
went
to
try
and
catch
them
but
found
them
perfectly
wild
wednesday
september
we
got
an
early
start
this
morning
and
traveled
till
four
distance
twenty
and
a
quarter
miles
we
camped
near
the
river
in
high
grass
the
road
has
run
close
to
the
river
all
day
except
a
few
miles
beyond
castle
creek
and
although
the
ground
is
perfectly
dry
it
is
very
rough
it
having
been
cut
up
in
wet
weather
watch
and
wolfe
creeks
had
abundance
of
water
in
them
as
much
as
when
we
went
up
castle
river
was
about
a
foot
deep
we
have
not
seen
many
buffalo
today
but
after
we
camped
john
norton
shot
two
at
one
shot
barney
also
killed
a
young
cow
the
weather
is
yet
fine
and
very
warm
thursday
september
this
day
we
traveled
only
sixteen
and
a
quarter
miles
then
camped
a
quarter
of
a
mile
east
of
rattlesnake
creek
on
the
banks
of
the
river
in
this
creek
there
is
still
a
very
heavy
current
of
water
running
it
appears
that
some
of
the
brethren
left
their
fires
burning
this
morning
and
the
prairie
has
caught
fire
and
is
still
burning
furiously
october
friday
october
this
morning
i
wrote
a
short
letter
and
left
it
in
a
post
for
the
company
behind
we
traveled
twenty
miles
and
camped
on
bluff
creek
the
day
fine
and
very
warm
saturday
october
this
morning
we
calculated
to
travel
eleven
miles
but
on
arriving
at
the
north
bluff
fork
we
found
no
grass
and
were
compelled
to
continue
on
we
traveled
till
the
road
strikes
the
river
and
some
grass
then
camped
having
traveled
eighteen
and
a
half
miles
three
buffalo
have
been
killed
today
and
there
are
considerable
in
this
region
two
of
the
oxen
gave
out
and
had
to
be
left
on
the
road
sunday
october
this
morning
we
traveled
four
and
a
quarter
miles
then
camped
opposite
some
islands
where
there
is
pretty
good
feed
and
willows
the
day
has
been
exceedingly
warm
and
the
brethren
have
dried
a
good
quantity
of
meat
considerable
anxiety
and
feeling
has
originated
in
the
breasts
of
two
or
three
brethren
in
consequence
of
a
rumor
being
circulated
which
deeply
concerns
one
individual
but
it
is
not
known
whom
in
the
evening
a
strong
north
wind
blew
up
which
made
it
turn
very
cool
monday
october
cool
and
pleasant
we
traveled
twenty
and
three
quarters
miles
and
found
that
the
last
company
have
made
a
new
road
near
the
bluffs
to
avoid
a
very
bad
slough
we
went
a
little
on
the
old
road
and
then
struck
across
to
the
new
road
but
had
considerable
difficulty
in
crossing
the
slough
we
camped
beside
a
small
lake
of
not
very
good
water
and
several
miles
from
timber
tuesday
october
pleasant
day
we
traveled
nineteen
miles
then
turned
off
the
road
about
a
half
a
mile
to
camp
near
a
small
bunch
of
timber
the
brethren
have
killed
a
good
many
buffalo
today
they
are
very
plentiful
here
and
wolves
abundant
wednesday
october
the
largest
part
of
the
company
again
concluded
to
tarry
a
day
again
although
there
is
little
feed
here
some
determined
to
go
on
a
piece
and
amongst
the
rest
i
felt
more
willing
to
go
on
than
to
tarry
accordingly
eleven
wagons
started
viz
jackson
redding
william
empey
lewis
barney
roswell
stevens
cummings
joseph
hancock
sanderson
john
pack
thos
cloward
zebedee
coltrin
and
norton
jacobs
we
traveled
seventeen
and
a
half
miles
and
then
turned
off
the
road
about
a
half
a
mile
to
camp
thursday
october
we
started
a
little
before
and
traveled
till
nearly
dark
and
had
then
to
run
over
a
mile
from
the
road
to
camp
we
traveled
nineteen
and
a
quarter
miles
wind
very
strong
from
the
north
and
a
very
cold
day
friday
october
just
as
we
started
this
morning
twelve
or
fifteen
indians
were
seen
running
over
the
river
towards
us
they
soon
came
up
to
the
wagons
which
were
somewhat
scattered
and
although
they
shook
hands
they
showed
savage
hostility
four
of
the
oxen
were
not
yet
yoked
up
these
they
drove
off
from
the
wagons
which
now
began
to
draw
together
they
soon
satisfied
us
that
they
were
bent
on
robbing
us
and
without
ceremony
took
jack
redding
horse
from
behind
the
wagon
lamb
went
to
take
it
from
them
and
seized
the
lariat
which
another
immediately
cut
with
his
knife
lamb
then
got
on
the
horse
but
no
sooner
on
than
two
indians
pulled
him
off
and
marched
off
with
the
horse
they
stole
jack
redding
knife
out
of
its
sheath
and
one
from
john
pack
they
also
tried
to
get
jack
off
the
horse
he
was
riding
but
he
kept
his
seat
they
tried
skeen
horse
but
he
kicked
one
of
them
over
the
indians
then
tried
to
get
the
men
out
of
their
wagons
so
that
they
might
get
in
and
plunder
but
every
man
kept
in
his
wagon
to
guard
it
and
we
concluded
to
turn
about
and
go
back
to
the
company
we
accordingly
started
and
the
indians
turned
back
towards
the
timber
with
the
horse
four
oxen
two
knives
and
a
sack
of
salt
after
traveling
back
about
six
miles
we
met
the
company
told
the
story
and
bore
their
slang
and
insults
without
saying
much
but
not
without
thinking
a
great
deal
the
whole
company
were
then
formed
in
two
lines
all
the
arms
were
loaded
and
each
man
that
could
raise
a
gun
was
ordered
to
walk
beside
the
wagons
the
horsemen
to
go
ahead
we
then
proceeded
on
and
when
we
came
opposite
to
where
we
met
with
the
indians
the
horsemen
went
down
and
found
the
oxen
where
we
left
them
they
brought
them
and
we
traveled
till
dark
then
camped
near
the
river
having
traveled
five
and
a
quarter
miles
from
last
night
exclusive
of
the
distance
we
went
back
a
strong
guard
was
placed
around
the
cattle
and
camp
and
kept
up
through
the
night
many
hard
speeches
have
passed
among
the
brethren
such
as
damned
hypocrites
damned
liars
mutineers
and
most
of
those
who
started
ahead
are
ordered
to
travel
in
the
rear
all
the
time
this
savage
tyrannical
conduct
was
one
thing
which
induced
some
to
leave
and
undertake
to
go
through
alone
and
more
peaceably
and
it
will
still
leave
feelings
of
revenge
and
hatred
which
will
require
some
time
to
cover
up
young
babcock
shook
his
fist
in
zebedee
coltrin
face
and
damned
him
and
said
he
could
whip
him
for
my
part
i
shall
be
glad
when
i
get
in
more
peaceable
society
and
i
think
i
shall
not
easily
be
caught
in
such
a
scrape
again
saturday
october
we
have
had
no
disturbance
from
indians
we
started
at
six
and
went
on
five
miles
to
get
better
feed
we
then
halted
for
breakfast
the
remainder
of
the
day
travel
was
mostly
over
dog
towns
a
united
states
soldier
came
up
to
the
wagons
and
went
with
us
a
few
miles
he
says
there
are
ninety
of
them
on
the
island
surveying
and
looking
out
a
place
to
build
a
fort
we
traveled
seventeen
and
a
quarter
miles
today
then
camped
near
a
low
bench
of
land
where
there
is
plenty
of
grass
and
water
and
willows
for
fuel
a
number
of
the
soldiers
came
over
to
camp
they
say
the
pawnees
are
perfectly
enraged
and
savage
and
that
the
worst
band
of
between
four
and
five
hundred
are
on
the
north
side
the
platte
about
forty
miles
below
sunday
october
morning
fine
but
cold
wind
the
captains
called
the
camp
together
and
asked
whether
we
shall
wait
here
three
days
or
a
week
for
the
twelve
or
shall
we
continue
on
to
winter
quarters
thirty
men
voted
to
go
on
seventeen
voted
to
wait
and
the
remainder
did
not
vote
the
majority
having
voted
to
go
on
we
started
and
traveled
very
slowly
till
about
five
then
turned
off
to
the
river
to
camp
having
traveled
sixteen
miles
there
are
many
new
tracks
of
indians
on
the
sand
bar
but
we
have
seen
none
today
monday
october
morning
cloudy
and
cold
we
have
had
a
little
very
cold
rain
and
there
is
great
appearance
for
more
we
started
on
but
it
continued
to
rain
heavily
till
near
noon
the
afternoon
was
fair
but
very
cold
we

cold

strong
northwest
wind
we
found
the
creek
difficult
to
cross
it
being
soft
and
miry
but
all
soon
got
over
safely
and
we
proceeded
on
the

in
hunting
for
a
place
to
cross
the
river
it
was
finally
concluded
to
cross
a
mile
higher
up
and
we
proceeded
to
the
place
while
going
up
we
saw
a
company
of
horsemen
and
two
wagons
on
the
other
side
the
river
which
we
soon
recognized
to
be
our
brethren
from
winter
quarters
all
the
wagons
got
over
safely
and
camped
on
the
hill
having
traveled
two
miles
the
company
is
a
part
of
the
old
police
going
to
meet
the
next
company
we
were
gladdened
with
the
news
they
bring
from
winter
quarters
friday
october
the
brethren
of
the
police
started
early
this
morning
to
go
on
and
meet
the
next
company
they
got
well
over
the
river
but
not
without
getting
into
the
water
to
lift
at
the
wagon
wheels
it
was
late
when
we
started
on
account
of
some
oxen
being
missing
and
there
are
some
who
will
not
look
for
their
cattle
till
all
the
rest
are
ready
to
start
we
traveled
till
a
little
after

the
loup
fork
distance

and
three
quarters
miles
day
warmer
saturday
october
the
night
has
been
very
stormy
there
being
a
strong
wind
rain
and
very
cold
we
made
an
early
start
and
by
noon
arrived
at
the
mission
station
we
found
the
pawnees
busy
gathering
corn
probably
nearly
a
thousand
of
men
women
and
children
they
soon
began
to
come
to
the
wagons
and
their
chiefs
made
inquiries
by
signs
about
the
chirrarots
or
sioux
some
of
the
brethren
gave
them
to
understand
that
the
sioux
were
within
five
days
of
them
the
chief
immediately
gave
the
word
to
the
rest
and
in
half
an
hour
the
squaws
had
loaded
their
corn
on
ponies
and
mules
and
then
began
to
march
towards
the
river
they
show
great
fear
of
the
sioux
they
were
very
anxious
to
have
us
camp
with
them
tonight
but
we
kept
moving
on
one
of
the
wagons
was
upset
crossing
a
ravine
several
of
the
brethren
traded
for
corn
at
three
we
arrived
and
turned
out
the
teams
on
beaver
river
having
traveled
seventeen
and
a
quarter
miles
soon
after
we
arrived
some
of
the
indians
came
up
having
followed
with
the
idea
of
trading
they
have
conducted
themselves
peaceably
so
far
but
they
are
not
to
be
trusted
in
consequence
of
their
following
us
it
was
the
feeling
of
most
of
the
brethren
to
go
on
a
few
miles
after
dark
at
we
started
on
and
traveled
till
being
six
and
a
half
miles

and
a

monday

day
pleasant
but
cool
tuesday
october
the
night
was
excessively
cold
and
this
morning
there
is
considerable
ice
we
got
an
early
start
and
traveled
to
where
the
road
leaves
the
river
and
crosses
to
the
horn
at
this
place
there
is
a
liberty
pole
set
up
by
some
of
the
brethren
we
have
traveled
today
and
a
quarter
miles
and
we
now
find
that
the
grass
is
all
burned
off
ahead
of
us
as
far
as
we
can
see
probably
to
the
elk
horn
we
are
cheered
by
a
view
of
the
timber
on
that
stream
wednesday
october
we
started
early
and
found
the
prairie
all
burned
off
to
the
elk
horn
except
in
small
patches
we
arrived
at
the
horn
about
noon
and
soon
after
commenced
crossing
where
hosea
stout
and
company
crossed
the
water
was
nearly
three
feet
deep
and
the
bottom
somewhat
soft
but
we
were
soon
all
over
without
accident
except
john
pack
who
broke
his
wagon
tongue
we
then
had
to
make
a
road
through
high
strong
grass
for
upwards
of
half
a
mile
and
found
a
very
bad
creek
or
slough
to
cross
when
we
again
struck
the
main
road
we
found
it
good
and
started
for
the
papea
where
we
arrived
soon
after
dark
all
except
one
wagon
which
was
left
a
mile
back
the
evening
cool
and
windy
thursday
october
this
morning
brother
empey
lamb
and
myself
started
early
accompanied
by
six
horsemen
and
arrived
in
winter
quarters
a
little
before
noon
i
found
my
family
all
well
except
moroni
who
is
very
sick
and
his
mother
is
somewhat
sick
their
circumstances
are
not
good
but
in
other
respects
they
have
been
prosperous
for
which
i
thank
my
god
there
has
been
much
sickness
here
and
many
deaths
during
the
fall
and
many
are
now
suffering
for
lack
of
some
of
the
comforts
of
life
we
have
been
prosperous
on
our
journey
home
and
have
arrived
in
nine
weeks
and
three
days
including
a
week
delay
waiting
for
the
twelve
and
killing
buffalo
our
health
has
been
remarkably
good
but
we
have
lacked
provisions
many
of
us
having
nothing
but
dry
buffalo
meat
i
have
succeeded
in
measuring
the
whole
distance
from
the
city
of
the
great
salt
lake
to
this
place
except
a
few
miles
between
horse
creek
and
the
a
la
bonte
river
which
was
taken
from
the
measurement
going
up
i
find
the
whole
distance
to
be
miles
and
am
now
prepared
to
make
a
complete
traveler
guide
from
here
to
the
great
salt
lake
having
been
careful
in
taking
the
distance
from
creek
to
creek
over
bluffs
mountains
etc
it
has
required
much
time
and
care
and
i
have
continually
labored
under
disadvantages
in
consequence
of
the
companies
feeling
no
interest
in
it
the
health
of
my
family
has
encouraged
me
for
all
that
is
past
and
my
secret
gratitude
shall
ascend
to
heaven
for
the
unbounded
kindness
and
mercies
which
the
almighty
has
continually
poured
upon
them
in
my
absence
