i
the
burden
of
the
valley
of
vision
i
came
here
eight
years
ago
as
the
renter
of
this
farm
of
which
soon
afterward
i
became
the
owner
the
time
before
that
i
like
to
forget
the
chief
impression
it
left
upon
my
memory
now
happily
growing
indistinct
is
of
being
hurried
faster
than
i
could
well
travel
from
the
moment
as
a
boy
of
seventeen
i
first
began
to
pay
my
own
way
my
days
were
ordered
by
an
inscrutable
power
which
drove
me
hourly
to
my
task
i
was
rarely
allowed
to
look
up
or
down
but
always
forward
toward
that
vague
success
which
we
americans
love
to
glorify
my
senses
my
nerves
even
my
muscles
were
continually
strained
to
the
utmost
of
attainment
if
i
loitered
or
paused
by
the
wayside
as
it
seems
natural
for
me
to
do
i
soon
heard
the
sharp
crack
of
the
lash
for
many
years
and
i
can
say
it
truthfully
i
never
rested
i
neither
thought
nor
reflected
i
had
no
pleasure
even
though
i
pursued
it
fiercely
during
the
brief
respite
of
vacations
through
many
feverish
years
i
did
not
work
i
merely
produced
the
only
real
thing
i
did
was
to
hurry
as
though
every
moment
were
my
last
as
though
the
world
which
now
seems
so
rich
in
everything
held
only
one
prize
which
might
be
seized
upon
before
i
arrived
since
then
i
have
tried
to
recall
like
one
who
struggles
to
restore
the
visions
of
a
fever
what
it
was
that
i
ran
to
attain
or
why
i
should
have
borne
without
rebellion
such
indignities
to
soul
and
body
that
life
seems
now
of
all
illusions
the
most
distant
and
unreal
it
is
like
the
unguessed
eternity
before
we
are
born
not
of
concern
compared
with
that
eternity
upon
which
we
are
now
embarked
all
these
things
happened
in
cities
and
among
crowds
i
like
to
forget
them
they
smack
of
that
slavery
of
the
spirit
which
is
so
much
worse
than
any
mere
slavery
of
the
body
one
day
it
was
in
april
i
remember
and
the
soft
maples
in
the
city
park
were
just
beginning
to
blossom
i
stopped
suddenly
i
did
not
intend
to
stop
i
confess
in
humiliation
that
it
was
no
courage
no
will
of
my
own
i
intended
to
go
on
toward
success
but
fate
stopped
me
it
was
as
if
i
had
been
thrown
violently
from
a
moving
planet
all
the
universe
streamed
around
me
and
past
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
of
all
animate
creation
i
was
the
only
thing
that
was
still
or
silent
until
i
stopped
i
had
not
known
the
pace
i
ran
and
i
had
a
vague
sympathy
and
understanding
never
felt
before
for
those
who
left
the
running
i
lay
prostrate
with
fever
and
close
to
death
for
weeks
and
watched
the
world
go
by
the
dust
the
noise
the
very
colour
of
haste
the
only
sharp
pang
that
i
suffered
was
the
feeling
that
i
should
be
and
that
i
was
not
that
i
should
care
and
that
i
did
not
it
was
as
though
i
had
died
and
escaped
all
further
responsibility
i
even
watched
with
dim
equanimity
my
friends
racing
past
me
panting
as
they
ran
some
of
them
paused
an
instant
to
comfort
me
where
i
lay
but
i
could
see
that
their
minds
were
still
upon
the
running
and
i
was
glad
when
they
went
away
i
can
not
tell
with
what
weariness
their
haste
oppressed
me
as
for
them
they
somehow
blamed
me
for
dropping
out
i
knew
until
we
ourselves
understand
we
accept
no
excuse
from
the
man
who
stops
while
i
felt
it
all
i
was
not
bitter
i
did
not
seem
to
care
i
said
to
myself
this
is
unfitness
i
survive
no
longer
so
be
it
thus
i
lay
and
presently
i
began
to
hunger
and
thirst
desire
rose
within
me
the
indescribable
longing
of
the
convalescent
for
the
food
of
recovery
so
i
lay
questioning
wearily
what
it
was
that
i
required
one
morning
i
wakened
with
a
strange
new
joy
in
my
soul
it
came
to
me
at
that
moment
with
indescribable
poignancy
the
thought
of
walking
barefoot
in
cool
fresh
plow
furrows
as
i
had
once
done
when
a
boy
so
vividly
the
memory
came
to
me
the
high
airy
world
as
it
was
at
that
moment
and
the
boy
i
was
walking
free
in
the
furrows
that
the
weak
tears
filled
my
eyes
the
first
i
had
shed
in
many
years
then
i
thought
of
sitting
in
quiet
thickets
in
old
fence
corners
the
wood
behind
me
rising
still
cool
mysterious
and
the
fields
in
front
stretching
away
in
illimitable
pleasantness
i
thought
of
the
good
smell
of
cows
at
milking
you
do
not
know
if
you
do
not
know
i
thought
of
the
sights
and
sounds
the
heat
and
sweat
of
the
hay
fields
i
thought
of
a
certain
brook
i
knew
when
a
boy
that
flowed
among
alders
and
wild
parsnips
where
i
waded
with
a
rod
for
trout
i
thought
of
all
these
things
as
a
man
thinks
of
his
first
love
oh
i
craved
the
soil
i
hungered
and
thirsted
for
the
earth
i
was
greedy
for
growing
things
and
thus
eight
years
ago
i
came
here
like
one
creeping
from
the
field
of
battle
i
remember
walking
in
the
sunshine
weak
yet
but
curiously
satisfied
i
that
was
dead
lived
again
it
came
to
me
then
with
a
curious
certainty
not
since
so
assuring
that
i
understood
the
chief
marvel
of
nature
hidden
within
the
story
of
the
resurrection
the
marvel
of
plant
and
seed
father
and
son
the
wonder
of
the
seasons
the
miracle
of
life
i
too
had
died
i
had
lain
long
in
darkness
and
now
i
had
risen
again
upon
the
sweet
earth
and
i
possessed
beyond
others
a
knowledge
of
a
former
existence
which
i
knew
even
then
i
could
never
return
to
for
a
time
in
the
new
life
i
was
happy
to
drunkenness
working
eating
sleeping
i
was
an
animal
again
let
out
to
run
in
green
pastures
i
was
glad
of
the
sunrise
and
the
sunset
i
was
glad
at
noon
it
delighted
me
when
my
muscles
ached
with
work
and
when
after
supper
i
could
not
keep
my
eyes
open
for
sheer
weariness
and
sometimes
i
was
awakened
in
the
night
out
of
a
sound
sleep
seemingly
by
the
very
silences
and
lay
in
a
sort
of
bodily
comfort
impossible
to
describe
i
did
not
want
to
feel
or
to
think
i
merely
wanted
to
live
in
the
sun
or
the
rain
i
wanted
to
go
out
and
come
in
and
never
again
know
the
pain
of
the
unquiet
spirit
i
looked
forward
to
an
awakening
not
without
dread
for
we
are
as
helpless
before
birth
as
in
the
presence
of
death
but
like
all
birth
it
came
at
last
suddenly
all
that
summer
i
had
worked
in
a
sort
of
animal
content
autumn
had
now
come
late
autumn
with
coolness
in
the
evening
air
i
was
plowing
in
my
upper
field
not
then
mine
in
fact
and
it
was
a
soft
afternoon
with
the
earth
turning
up
moist
and
fragrant
i
had
been
walking
the
furrows
all
day
long
i
had
taken
note
as
though
my
life
depended
upon
it
of
the
occasional
stones
or
roots
in
my
field
i
made
sure
of
the
adjustment
of
the
harness
i
drove
with
peculiar
care
to
save
the
horses
with
such
simple
details
of
the
work
in
hand
i
had
found
it
my
joy
to
occupy
my
mind
up
to
that
moment
the
most
important
things
in
the
world
had
seemed
a
straight
furrow
and
corners
to
me
then
a
profound
accomplishment
i
can
not
well
describe
it
save
by
the
analogy
of
an
opening
door
somewhere
within
the
house
of
my
consciousness
i
had
been
in
the
dark
i
seemed
to
emerge
i
had
been
bound
down
i
seemed
to
leap
up
and
with
a
marvellous
sudden
sense
of
freedom
and
joy
i
stopped
there
in
my
field
and
looked
up
and
it
was
as
if
i
had
never
looked
up
before
i
discovered
another
world
it
had
been
there
before
for
long
and
long
but
i
had
never
seen
nor
felt
it
all
discoveries
are
made
in
that
way
a
man
finds
the
new
thing
not
in
nature
but
in
himself
it
was
as
though
concerned
with
plow
and
harness
and
furrow
i
had
never
known
that
the
world
had
height
or
colour
or
sweet
sounds
or
that
there
was
in
a
hillside
i
forgot
myself
or
where
i
was
i
stood
a
long
time
motionless
my
dominant
feeling
if
i
can
at
all
express
it
was
of
a
strange
new
friendliness
a
warmth
as
though
these
hills
this
field
about
me
the
woods
had
suddenly
spoken
to
me
and
caressed
me
it
was
as
though
i
had
been
accepted
in
membership
as
though
i
was
now
recognised
after
long
trial
as
belonging
here
across
the
town
road
which
separates
my
farm
from
my
nearest
neighbour
i
saw
a
field
familiar
yet
strangely
new
and
unfamiliar
lying
up
to
the
setting
sun
all
red
with
autumn
above
it
the
incalculable
heights
of
the
sky
blue
but
not
quite
clear
owing
to
the
indian
summer
haze
i
can
not
convey
the
sweetness
and
softness
of
that
landscape
the
airiness
of
it
the
mystery
of
it
as
it
came
to
me
at
that
moment
it
was
as
though
looking
at
an
acquaintance
long
known
i
should
discover
that
i
loved
him
as
i
stood
there
i
was
conscious
of
the
cool
tang
of
burning
leaves
and
brush
heaps
the
lazy
smoke
of
which
floated
down
the
long
valley
and
found
me
in
my
field
and
finally
i
heard
as
though
the
sounds
were
then
made
for
the
first
time
all
the
vague
murmurs
of
the
country
side
a
somewhere
in
the
distance
the
creak
of
a
wagon
the
blurred
evening
hum
of
birds
insects
frogs
so
much
it
means
for
a
man
to
stop
and
look
up
from
his
task
so
i
stood
and
i
looked
up
and
down
with
a
glow
and
a
thrill
which
i
can
not
now
look
back
upon
without
some
envy
and
a
little
amusement
at
the
very
grandness
and
seriousness
of
it
all
and
i
said
aloud
to
myself
i
will
be
as
broad
as
the
earth
i
will
not
be
limited
thus
i
was
born
into
the
present
world
and
here
i
continue
not
knowing
what
other
world
i
may
yet
achieve
i
do
not
know
but
i
wait
in
expectancy
keeping
my
furrows
straight
and
my
corners
well
turned
since
that
day
in
the
field
though
my
fences
include
no
more
acres
and
i
still
plow
my
own
fields
my
real
domain
has
expanded
until
i
crop
wide
fields
and
take
the
profit
of
many
curious
pastures
from
my
farm
i
can
see
most
of
the
world
and
if
i
wait
here
long
enough
all
people
pass
this
way
and
i
look
out
upon
them
not
in
the
surroundings
which
they
have
chosen
for
themselves
but
from
the
vantage
ground
of
my
familiar
world
the
symbols
which
meant
so
much
in
cities
mean
little
here
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
as
though
i
saw
men
naked
they
come
and
stand
beside
my
oak
and
the
oak
passes
solemn
judgment
they
tread
my
furrows
and
the
clods
give
silent
evidence
they
touch
the
green
blades
of
my
corn
the
corn
whispers
its
sure
conclusions
stern
judgments
that
will
be
deceived
by
no
symbols
thus
i
have
delighted
secretly
in
calling
myself
an
unlimited
farmer
and
i
make
this
confession
in
answer
to
the
inner
and
truthful
demand
of
the
soul
that
we
are
not
after
all
the
slaves
of
things
whether
corn
or
banknotes
or
spindles
that
we
are
not
the
used
but
the
users
that
life
is
more
than
profit
and
loss
and
so
i
shall
expect
that
while
i
am
talking
farm
some
of
you
may
be
thinking
dry
goods
banking
literature
carpentry
or
but
if
you
can
say
i
am
an
unlimited
dry
goods
merchant
i
am
an
unlimited
carpenter
i
will
give
you
an
country
strong
and
warm
we
are
friends
our
orbits
coincide
ii
i
buy
a
farm
as
i
have
said
when
i
came
here
i
came
as
a
renter
working
all
of
the
first
summer
without
that
open
vision
of
which
the
prophet
samuel
speaks
i
had
no
memory
of
the
past
and
no
hope
of
the
future
i
fed
upon
the
moment
my
sister
harriet
kept
the
house
and
i
looked
after
the
farm
and
the
fields
in
all
those
months
i
hardly
knew
that
i
had
neighbours
although
horace
from
whom
i
rented
my
place
was
not
infrequently
a
visitor
he
has
since
said
that
i
looked
at
him
as
though
he
were
a
statute
i
was
citified
horace
said
and
citified
with
us
here
in
the
country
is
nearly
the
limit
of
invective
though
not
violent
enough
to
discourage
such
a
gift
of
sociability
as
his
the
scotch
preacher
the
rarest
kindest
man
i
know
called
once
or
twice
wearing
the
air
of
formality
which
so
ill
becomes
him
i
saw
nothing
in
him
it
was
my
fault
not
his
that
i
missed
so
many
weeks
of
his
friendship
once
in
that
time
the
professor
crossed
my
fields
with
his
tin
box
slung
from
his
shoulder
and
the
only
feeling
i
had
born
of
crowded
cities
was
that
this
was
an
intrusion
upon
my
property
intrusion
and
the
professor
it
is
now
unthinkable
i
often
passed
the
carpentry
shop
on
my
way
to
town
i
saw
baxter
many
times
at
his
bench
even
then
baxter
eyes
attracted
me
he
always
glanced
up
at
me
as
i
passed
and
his
look
had
in
it
something
of
a
caress
so
the
home
of
starkweather
standing
aloof
among
its
broad
lawns
and
tall
trees
carried
no
meaning
for
me
of
all
my
neighbours
horace
is
the
nearest
from
the
back
door
of
my
house
looking
over
the
hill
i
can
see
the
two
red
chimneys
of
his
home
and
the
top
of
the
windmill
horace
barn
and
corn
silo
are
more
pretentious
by
far
than
his
house
but
fortunately
they
stand
on
lower
ground
where
they
are
not
visible
from
my
side
of
the
hill
five
minutes
walk
in
a
straight
line
across
the
fields
brings
me
to
door
by
the
road
it
takes
at
least
ten
minutes
in
the
fall
after
my
arrival
i
had
come
to
love
the
farm
and
its
surroundings
so
much
that
i
decided
to
have
it
for
my
own
i
did
not
look
ahead
to
being
a
farmer
i
did
not
ask
harriet
advice
i
found
myself
sitting
one
day
in
the
justice
office
the
justice
was
bald
and
as
dry
as
corn
fodder
in
march
he
sat
with
spectacled
impressiveness
behind
his
table
horace
hitched
his
heel
on
the
round
of
his
chair
and
put
his
hat
on
his
knee
he
wore
his
best
coat
and
his
hair
was
brushed
in
deference
to
the
occasion
he
looked
uncomfortable
but
important
i
sat
opposite
him
somewhat
overwhelmed
by
the
business
in
hand
i
felt
like
an
inadequate
boy
measured
against
solemnities
too
large
for
him
the
processes
seemed
curiously
unconvincing
like
a
game
in
which
the
important
part
is
to
keep
from
laughing
and
yet
when
i
thought
of
laughing
i
felt
cold
chills
of
horror
if
i
had
laughed
at
that
moment
i
can
not
think
what
that
justice
would
have
said
but
it
was
a
pleasure
to
have
the
old
man
read
the
deed
looking
at
me
over
his
spectacles
from
time
to
time
to
make
sure
i
was
not
playing
truant
there
are
good
and
great
words
in
a
deed
one
of
them
i
brought
away
with
me
from
the
conference
a
very
fine
big
one
which
i
love
to
have
out
now
and
again
to
remind
me
of
the
really
serious
things
of
life
it
gives
me
a
peculiar
dry
legal
feeling
if
i
am
about
to
enter
upon
a
serious
bargain
like
the
sale
of
a
cow
i
am
more
avaricious
if
i
work
with
it
under
my
tongue
hereditaments
hereditaments
some
words
need
to
be
fenced
in
so
that
they
can
not
escape
us
others
we
prefer
to
have
running
at
large
indefinite
but
inclusive
i
would
not
look
up
that
word
for
anything
i
might
find
it
fenced
in
so
that
it
could
not
mean
to
me
all
that
it
does
now
hereditaments
may
there
be
many
of
them
or
it
is
it
not
a
fine
providence
that
gives
us
different
things
to
love
in
the
purchase
of
my
farm
both
horace
and
i
got
the
better
of
the
bargain
and
yet
neither
was
cheated
in
reality
a
fairly
strong
lantern
light
will
shine
through
horace
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
hugging
himself
with
the
joy
of
his
bargain
but
i
was
content
i
had
some
money
left
what
more
does
anyone
want
after
a
bargain
and
i
had
come
into
possession
of
the
thing
i
desired
most
of
all
looking
at
bargains
from
a
purely
commercial
point
of
view
someone
is
always
cheated
but
looked
at
with
the
simple
eye
both
seller
and
buyer
always
win
we
came
away
from
the
gravity
of
that
bargaining
in
horace
wagon
on
our
way
home
horace
gave
me
fatherly
advice
about
using
my
farm
he
spoke
from
the
height
of
his
knowledge
to
me
a
humble
beginner
the
conversation
ran
something
like
this
horace
thar
a
clump
of
plum
trees
along
the
lower
pasture
fence
perhaps
you
saw
myself
i
saw
them
that
is
one
reason
i
bought
the
back
pasture
in
may
they
will
be
full
of
blossoms
horace
they
plums
they
ai
good
for
nothing
myself
but
think
how
fine
they
will
be
all
the
year
round
horace
fine
they
take
up
a
of
good
land
i
been
going
to
cut
myself
this
ten
years
myself
i
do
think
i
shall
want
them
cut
out
horace
humph
after
a
pause
horace
there
a
lot
of
good
body
in
that
oak
on
the
knoll
myself
why
that
oak
is
the
treasure
of
the
whole
farm
i
have
never
seen
a
finer
one
i
could
not
think
of
cutting
it
horace
it
will
bring
you
fifteen
or
twenty
dollars
cash
in
hand
myself
but
i
rather
have
the
oak
horace
humph
so
our
conversation
continued
for
some
time
i
let
horace
know
that
i
preferred
rail
fences
even
old
ones
to
a
wire
fence
and
that
i
thought
a
farm
should
not
be
too
large
else
it
might
keep
one
away
from
his
friends
and
what
i
asked
is
corn
compared
with
a
friend
oh
i
grew
really
oratorical
i
gave
it
as
my
opinion
that
there
should
be
vines
around
the
house
waste
of
time
said
horace
and
that
no
farmer
should
permit
anyone
to
paint
medicine
advertisements
on
his
barn
brings
you
ten
dollars
a
year
said
horace
and
that
i
proposed
to
fix
the
bridge
on
the
lower
road
what
a
for
asked
horace
i
said
that
a
town
was
a
useful
adjunct
for
a
farm
but
i
laid
it
down
as
a
principle
that
no
town
should
be
too
near
a
farm
i
finally
became
so
enthusiastic
in
setting
forth
my
conceptions
of
a
true
farm
that
i
reduced
horace
to
a
series
of
humphs
the
early
humphs
were
incredulous
but
as
i
proceeded
with
some
joy
they
became
humorously
contemptuous
and
finally
began
to
voice
a
large
comfortable
condescending
tolerance
i
could
fairly
feel
horace
growing
superior
as
he
sat
there
beside
me
oh
he
had
everything
in
his
favour
he
could
prove
what
he
said
one
tree
one
thicket
twenty
dollars
one
landscape
ten
cords
of
wood
a
of
corn
twenty
dollars
these
equations
prove
themselves
moreover
was
not
horace
the
best
off
of
any
farmer
in
the
country
did
he
not
have
the
largest
barn
and
the
best
corn
silo
and
are
there
better
arguments
have
you
ever
had
anyone
give
you
up
as
hopeless
and
is
it
not
a
pleasure
it
is
only
after
people
resign
you
to
your
fate
that
you
really
make
friends
of
them
for
how
can
you
win
the
friendship
of
one
who
is
trying
to
convert
you
to
his
superior
beliefs
as
we
talked
then
horace
and
i
i
began
to
have
hopes
of
him
there
is
no
joy
comparable
to
the
making
of
a
friend
and
the
more
resistant
the
material
the
greater
the
triumph
baxter
the
carpenter
says
that
when
he
works
for
enjoyment
he
chooses
curly
maple
when
horace
set
me
down
at
my
gate
that
afternoon
he
gave
me
his
hand
and
told
me
that
he
would
look
in
on
me
occasionally
and
that
if
i
had
any
trouble
to
let
him
know
a
few
days
later
i
heard
by
the
roundabout
telegraph
common
in
country
neighbourhoods
that
horace
had
found
a
good
deal
of
fun
in
reporting
what
i
said
about
farming
and
that
he
had
called
me
by
a
highly
humorous
but
disparaging
name
horace
has
a
vein
of
humour
all
his
own
i
have
caught
him
alone
in
his
fields
chuckling
to
himself
and
even
breaking
out
in
a
loud
laugh
at
the
memory
of
some
amusing
incident
that
happened
ten
years
ago
one
day
a
month
or
more
after
our
bargain
horace
came
down
across
his
field
and
hitched
his
leg
over
my
fence
with
the
intent
i
am
sure
of
delving
a
little
more
in
the
same
rich
mine
of
humour
horace
i
said
looking
him
straight
in
the
eye
did
you
call
me
an
agriculturist
i
have
rarely
seen
a
man
so
pitifully
confused
as
horace
was
at
that
moment
he
flushed
he
stammered
he
coughed
the
perspiration
broke
out
on
his
forehead
he
tried
to
speak
and
could
not
i
was
sorry
for
him
horace
i
said
you
a
farmer
we
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
with
dreadful
seriousness
and
then
both
of
us
laughed
to
the
point
of
holding
our
sides
we
slapped
our
knees
we
shouted
we
wriggled
we
almost
rolled
with
merriment
horace
put
out
his
hand
and
we
shook
heartily
in
five
minutes
i
had
the
whole
story
of
his
humorous
reports
out
of
him
no
real
friendship
is
ever
made
without
an
initial
clashing
which
discloses
the
metal
of
each
to
each
since
that
day
horace
leg
has
rested
many
a
time
on
my
fence
and
we
have
talked
crops
and
calves
we
have
been
the
best
of
friends
in
the
way
of
butter
tubs
and
pig
killings
but
never
once
looked
up
together
at
the
sky
the
chief
objection
to
a
joke
in
the
country
is
that
it
is
so
imperishable
there
is
so
much
room
for
jokes
and
so
few
jokes
to
fill
it
when
i
see
horace
approaching
with
a
peculiar
friendly
reminiscent
smile
on
his
face
i
hasten
with
all
ardour
to
anticipate
him
horace
i
exclaim
you
a
farmer
illustration
the
heat
and
sweat
of
the
hay
fields
iii
the
joy
of
possession
how
sweet
the
west
wind
sounds
in
my
own
trees
how
graceful
climb
these
shadows
on
my
hill
always
as
i
travel
i
think
here
i
am
let
anything
happen
i
do
not
want
to
know
the
future
knowledge
is
too
certain
too
cold
too
real
it
is
true
that
i
have
not
always
met
the
fine
adventure
nor
won
the
friend
but
if
i
had
what
should
i
have
more
to
look
for
at
other
turnings
and
other
hilltops
the
afternoon
of
my
purchase
was
one
of
the
great
afternoons
of
my
life
when
horace
put
me
down
at
my
gate
i
did
not
go
at
once
to
the
house
i
did
not
wish
then
to
talk
with
harriet
the
things
i
had
with
myself
were
too
important
i
skulked
toward
my
barn
compelling
myself
to
walk
slowly
until
i
reached
the
corner
where
i
broke
into
an
eager
run
as
though
the
old
nick
himself
were
after
me
behind
the
barn
i
dropped
down
on
the
grass
panting
with
laughter
and
not
without
some
of
the
shame
a
man
feels
at
being
a
boy
close
along
the
side
of
the
barn
as
i
sat
there
in
the
cool
of
the
shade
i
could
see
a
tangled
mat
of
smartweed
and
catnip
and
the
boards
of
the
barn
brown
and
and
the
gables
above
with
mud
swallows
nests
now
deserted
and
it
struck
me
suddenly
as
i
observed
these
homely
pleasant
things
all
this
is
mine
i
sprang
up
and
drew
a
long
breath
mine
i
said
it
came
to
me
then
like
an
inspiration
that
i
might
now
go
out
and
take
formal
possession
of
my
farm
i
might
experience
the
emotion
of
a
landowner
i
might
swell
with
dignity
and
importance
for
once
at
least
so
i
started
at
the
fence
corner
back
of
the
barn
and
walked
straight
up
through
the
pasture
keeping
close
to
my
boundaries
that
i
might
not
miss
a
single
rod
of
my
acres
and
oh
it
was
a
prime
afternoon
the
lord
made
it
sunshine
and
autumn
haze
and
red
trees
and
yellow
fields
and
blue
distances
above
the
town
and
the
air
had
a
tang
which
got
into
a
man
blood
and
set
him
chanting
all
the
poetry
he
ever
knew
i
climb
that
was
a
clod
i
run
whose
steps
were
slow
i
reap
the
very
wheat
of
god
that
once
had
none
to
sow
so
i
walked
up
the
margin
of
my
field
looking
broadly
about
me
and
presently
i
began
to
examine
my
fences
fences
with
a
critical
eye
i
considered
the
quality
of
the
soil
though
in
truth
i
was
not
much
of
a
judge
of
such
matters
i
gloated
over
my
plowed
land
lying
there
open
and
passive
in
the
sunshine
i
said
of
this
tree
it
is
mine
and
of
its
companion
beyond
the
fence
it
is
my
neighbour
deeply
and
sharply
within
myself
i
drew
the
line
between
and
for
only
thus
by
comparing
ourselves
with
our
neighbours
can
we
come
to
the
true
realisation
of
property
occasionally
i
stopped
to
pick
up
a
stone
and
cast
it
over
the
fence
thinking
with
some
truculence
that
my
neighbour
would
probably
throw
it
back
again
never
mind
i
had
it
out
of
field
once
with
eager
surplusage
of
energy
i
pulled
down
a
dead
and
partly
rotten
oak
stub
long
an
with
an
important
feeling
of
proprietorship
i
could
do
anything
i
liked
the
farm
was
how
sweet
an
emotion
is
possession
what
charm
is
inherent
in
ownership
what
a
foundation
for
vanity
even
for
the
greater
quality
of
lies
in
a
little
property
i
fell
to
thinking
of
the
excellent
wording
of
the
old
books
in
which
land
is
called
real
property
or
real
estate
money
we
may
possess
or
goods
or
chattels
but
they
give
no
such
impression
of
mineness
as
the
feeling
that
feet
rest
upon
soil
that
is
his
that
part
of
the
deep
earth
is
his
with
all
the
water
upon
it
all
small
animals
that
creep
or
crawl
in
the
holes
of
it
all
birds
or
insects
that
fly
in
the
air
above
it
all
trees
shrubs
flowers
and
grass
that
grow
upon
it
all
houses
barns
and
fences
all
his
as
i
strode
along
that
afternoon
i
fed
upon
possession
i
rolled
the
sweet
morsel
of
ownership
under
my
tongue
i
seemed
to
set
my
feet
down
more
firmly
on
the
good
earth
i
straightened
my
shoulders
land
was
i
picked
up
a
clod
of
earth
and
let
it
crumble
and
drop
through
my
fingers
it
gave
me
a
peculiar
and
poignant
feeling
of
possession
i
can
understand
why
the
miser
enjoys
the
very
physical
contact
of
his
gold
every
sense
i
possessed
sight
hearing
smell
touch
led
upon
the
new
joy
at
one
corner
of
my
upper
field
the
fence
crosses
an
abrupt
ravine
upon
leggy
stilts
my
line
skirts
the
slope
halfway
up
my
neighbour
owns
the
crown
of
the
hill
which
he
has
shorn
until
it
resembles
the
tonsured
pate
of
a
monk
every
rain
brings
the
light
soil
down
the
ravine
and
lays
it
like
a
hand
of
infertility
upon
my
farm
it
had
always
bothered
me
this
wastage
and
as
i
looked
across
my
fence
i
thought
to
myself
i
must
have
that
hill
i
will
buy
it
i
will
set
the
fence
farther
up
i
will
plant
the
slope
it
is
no
age
of
tonsures
either
in
religion
or
agriculture
the
very
vision
of
widened
acres
set
my
thoughts
on
fire
in
imagination
i
extended
my
farm
upon
all
sides
thinking
how
much
better
i
could
handle
my
land
than
my
neighbours
i
dwelt
avariciously
upon
more
possessions
i
thought
with
discontent
of
my
poverty
more
land
i
wanted
i
was
enveloped
in
clouds
of
envy
i
coveted
my
land
i
felt
myself
superior
and
horace
inferior
i
was
consumed
with
black
vanity
so
i
dealt
hotly
with
these
thoughts
until
i
reached
the
top
of
the
ridge
at
the
farther
corner
of
my
land
it
is
the
highest
point
on
the
farm
for
a
moment
i
stood
looking
about
me
on
a
wonderful
prospect
of
serene
beauty
as
it
came
to
me
hills
fields
woods
the
fever
which
had
been
consuming
me
died
down
i
thought
how
the
world
stretched
away
from
my
fences
just
such
fields
for
a
thousand
miles
and
in
each
small
enclosure
a
man
as
hot
as
i
with
the
passion
of
possession
how
they
all
envied
and
hated
in
their
longing
for
more
land
how
property
kept
them
apart
prevented
the
close
confident
touch
of
friendship
how
it
separated
lovers
and
ruined
families
of
all
obstacles
to
that
complete
democracy
of
which
we
dream
is
there
a
greater
than
property
i
was
ashamed
deep
shame
covered
me
how
little
of
the
earth
after
all
i
said
lies
within
the
limits
of
my
fences
and
i
looked
out
upon
the
perfect
beauty
of
the
world
around
me
and
i
saw
how
little
excited
it
was
how
placid
how
undemanding
i
had
come
here
to
be
free
and
already
this
farm
which
i
thought
of
so
fondly
as
my
possession
was
coming
to
possess
me
ownership
is
an
appetite
like
hunger
or
thirst
and
as
we
may
eat
to
gluttony
and
drink
to
drunkenness
so
we
may
possess
to
avarice
how
many
men
have
i
seen
who
though
they
regard
themselves
as
models
of
temperance
wear
the
marks
of
unbridled
indulgence
of
the
passion
of
possession
and
how
like
gluttony
or
licentiousness
it
sets
its
sure
sign
upon
their
faces
i
said
to
myself
why
should
any
man
fence
himself
in
and
why
hope
to
enlarge
one
world
by
the
creeping
acquisition
of
a
few
acres
to
his
farm
i
thought
of
the
old
scientist
who
laying
his
hand
upon
the
grass
remarked
everything
under
my
hand
is
a
miracle
forgetting
that
everything
outside
was
also
a
miracle
illustration
how
graceful
climb
these
shadows
on
my
hill
as
i
stood
there
i
glanced
across
the
broad
valley
wherein
lies
the
most
of
my
farm
to
a
field
of
buckwheat
which
belongs
to
horace
for
an
instant
it
gave
me
the
illusion
of
a
hill
on
fire
for
the
late
sun
shone
full
on
the
thick
ripe
stalks
of
the
buckwheat
giving
forth
an
abundant
red
glory
that
blessed
the
eye
horace
had
been
proud
of
his
crop
smacking
his
lips
at
the
prospect
of
winter
pancakes
and
here
i
was
entering
his
field
and
taking
without
hindrance
another
crop
a
crop
gathered
not
with
hands
nor
stored
in
granaries
a
wonderful
crop
which
once
gathered
may
long
be
fed
upon
and
yet
remain
unconsumed
so
i
looked
across
the
countryside
a
group
of
elms
here
a
tufted
hilltop
there
the
smooth
verdure
of
pastures
the
rich
brown
of
fields
and
the
odours
and
the
sounds
of
the
country
all
cropped
by
me
how
little
the
fences
keep
me
out
i
do
not
regard
titles
nor
consider
boundaries
i
enter
either
by
day
or
by
night
but
not
secretly
taking
my
fill
i
leave
as
much
as
i
find
and
thus
standing
upon
the
highest
hill
in
my
upper
pasture
i
thought
of
the
quoted
saying
of
a
certain
old
abbot
of
the
middle
ages
he
that
is
a
true
monk
considers
nothing
as
belonging
to
him
except
a
lyre
what
finer
spirit
who
shall
step
forth
freer
than
he
who
goes
with
nothing
save
his
lyre
he
shall
sing
as
he
goes
he
shall
not
be
held
down
nor
fenced
in
with
a
lifting
of
the
soul
i
thought
of
that
old
abbot
how
smooth
his
brow
how
catholic
his
interest
how
serene
his
outlook
how
free
his
friendships
how
unlimited
his
whole
life
nothing
but
a
lyre
so
i
made
a
covenant
there
with
myself
i
said
i
shall
use
not
be
used
i
do
not
limit
myself
here
i
shall
not
allow
possessions
to
come
between
me
and
my
life
or
my
friends
for
a
time
how
long
i
do
not
know
i
stood
thinking
presently
i
discovered
moving
slowly
along
the
margin
of
the
field
below
me
the
old
professor
with
his
tin
botany
box
and
somehow
i
had
no
feeling
that
he
was
intruding
upon
my
new
land
his
walk
was
slow
and
methodical
his
head
and
even
his
shoulders
were
bent
almost
habitually
from
looking
close
upon
the
earth
and
from
time
to
time
he
stooped
and
once
he
knelt
to
examine
some
object
that
attracted
his
eye
it
seemed
appropriate
that
he
should
thus
kneel
to
the
earth
so
he
gathered
crop
and
fences
did
not
keep
him
out
nor
titles
disturb
him
he
also
was
free
it
gave
me
at
that
moment
a
peculiar
pleasure
to
have
him
on
my
land
to
know
that
i
was
if
unconsciously
raising
other
crops
than
i
knew
i
felt
friendship
for
this
old
professor
i
could
understand
him
i
thought
and
i
said
aloud
but
in
a
low
tone
as
though
i
were
addressing
him
do
not
apologise
friend
when
you
come
into
my
field
you
do
not
interrupt
me
what
you
have
come
for
is
of
more
importance
at
this
moment
than
corn
who
is
it
that
says
i
must
plow
so
many
furrows
this
day
come
in
friend
and
sit
here
on
these
clods
we
will
sweeten
the
evening
with
fine
words
we
will
invest
our
time
not
in
corn
or
in
cash
but
in
i
walked
with
confidence
down
the
hill
toward
the
professor
so
engrossed
was
he
with
his
employment
that
he
did
not
see
me
until
i
was
within
a
few
paces
of
him
when
he
looked
up
at
me
it
was
as
though
his
eyes
returned
from
some
far
journey
i
felt
at
first
out
of
focus
unplaced
and
only
gradually
coming
into
view
in
his
hand
he
held
a
lump
of
earth
containing
a
thrifty
young
plant
of
the
purple
having
several
blossoms
he
worked
at
the
lump
deftly
delicately
so
that
the
earth
pinched
powdered
and
shaken
out
fell
between
his
fingers
leaving
the
knotty
yellow
roots
in
his
hand
i
marked
how
firm
slow
brown
the
old
man
was
how
little
obtrusive
in
my
field
one
foot
rested
in
a
furrow
the
other
was
set
among
the
grass
of
the
margin
near
the
fence
his
place
i
thought
his
first
words
though
of
little
moment
in
themselves
gave
me
a
curious
satisfaction
as
when
a
coin
tested
rings
true
gold
or
a
hero
tried
is
heroic
i
have
rarely
he
said
seen
a
finer
display
of
rudbeckia
than
this
along
these
old
fences
if
he
had
referred
to
me
or
questioned
or
apologised
i
should
have
been
disappointed
he
did
not
say
your
fences
he
said
these
fences
as
though
they
were
as
much
his
as
mine
and
he
spoke
in
his
own
world
knowing
that
if
i
could
enter
i
would
but
that
if
i
could
not
no
stooping
to
me
would
avail
either
of
us
it
has
been
a
good
autumn
for
flowers
i
said
inanely
for
so
many
things
were
flying
through
my
mind
that
i
could
not
at
once
think
of
the
great
particular
words
which
should
bring
us
together
at
first
i
thought
my
chance
had
passed
but
he
seemed
to
see
something
in
me
after
all
for
he
said
here
is
a
peculiarly
large
specimen
of
the
rudbeckia
observe
the
deep
purple
of
the
cone
and
the
bright
yellow
of
the
petals
here
is
another
that
grew
hardly
two
feet
away
in
the
grass
near
the
fence
where
the
rails
and
the
blackberry
bushes
have
shaded
it
how
small
and
undeveloped
it
is
they
crowd
up
to
the
plowed
land
i
observed
yes
they
reach
out
for
a
better
chance
in
life
like
men
with
more
room
better
food
freer
air
you
see
how
much
finer
they
grow
it
was
curious
to
me
having
hitherto
barely
observed
the
along
my
fences
save
as
a
colour
of
beauty
how
simply
we
fell
to
talking
of
them
as
though
in
truth
they
were
people
like
ourselves
having
our
desires
and
possessed
of
our
capabilities
it
gave
me
then
for
the
first
time
the
feeling
which
has
since
meant
such
varied
enjoyment
of
the
peopling
of
the
woods
see
here
he
said
how
different
the
character
of
these
individuals
they
are
all
of
the
same
species
they
all
grow
along
this
fence
within
two
or
three
rods
but
observe
the
difference
not
only
in
size
but
in
colouring
in
the
shape
of
the
petals
in
the
proportions
of
the
cone
what
does
it
all
mean
why
nature
trying
one
of
her
endless
experiments
she
sows
here
broadly
trying
to
produce
better
a
few
she
plants
on
the
edge
of
the
field
in
the
hope
that
they
may
escape
the
plow
if
they
grow
better
food
and
more
sunshine
produce
more
and
larger
flowers
so
we
talked
or
rather
he
talked
finding
in
me
an
eager
listener
and
what
he
called
botany
seemed
to
me
to
be
life
of
birth
of
growth
of
reproduction
of
death
he
spoke
and
his
flowers
became
sentient
creatures
under
my
eyes
and
thus
the
sun
went
down
and
the
purple
mists
crept
silently
along
the
distant
low
spots
and
all
the
great
great
mysteries
came
and
stood
before
me
beckoning
and
questioning
they
came
and
they
stood
and
out
of
the
as
the
old
professor
spoke
i
seemed
to
catch
a
glimmer
of
the
true
light
i
reflected
how
truly
everything
is
in
anything
if
one
could
really
understand
a
he
could
understand
this
earth
botany
was
only
one
road
toward
the
explanation
always
i
hope
that
some
traveller
may
have
more
news
of
the
way
than
i
and
sooner
or
later
i
find
i
must
make
inquiry
of
the
direction
of
every
thoughtful
man
i
meet
and
i
have
always
had
especial
hope
of
those
who
study
the
sciences
they
ask
such
intimate
questions
of
nature
theology
possesses
a
which
places
its
faith
in
human
theories
but
science
at
its
best
is
humble
before
nature
herself
it
has
no
thesis
to
defend
it
is
content
to
kneel
upon
the
earth
in
the
way
of
my
friend
the
old
professor
and
ask
the
simplest
questions
hoping
for
some
true
reply
i
wondered
then
what
the
professor
thought
after
his
years
of
work
of
the
mystery
and
finally
not
without
confusion
i
asked
him
he
listened
for
the
first
time
ceasing
to
dig
shake
out
and
arrange
his
specimens
when
i
had
stopped
speaking
he
remained
for
a
moment
silent
then
he
looked
at
me
with
a
new
regard
finally
he
quoted
quietly
but
with
a
deep
note
in
his
voice
canst
thou
by
searching
find
god
canst
thou
find
out
the
almighty
unto
perfection
it
is
as
high
as
heaven
what
canst
thou
do
deeper
than
hell
what
canst
thou
know
when
the
professor
had
spoken
we
stood
for
a
moment
silent
then
he
smiled
and
said
briskly
i
have
been
a
botanist
for
years
when
i
was
a
boy
i
believed
implicitly
in
god
i
prayed
to
him
having
a
vision
of
him
a
person
before
my
eyes
as
i
grew
older
i
concluded
that
there
was
no
god
i
dismissed
him
from
the
universe
i
believed
only
in
what
i
could
see
or
hear
or
feel
i
talked
about
nature
and
reality
he
paused
the
smile
still
lighting
his
face
evidently
recalling
to
himself
the
old
days
i
did
not
interrupt
him
finally
he
turned
to
me
and
said
abruptly
and
now
it
seems
to
me
there
is
nothing
but
god
as
he
said
this
he
lifted
his
arm
with
a
peculiar
gesture
that
seemed
to
take
in
the
whole
world
for
a
time
we
were
both
silent
when
i
left
him
i
offered
my
hand
and
told
him
i
hoped
i
might
become
his
friend
so
i
turned
my
face
toward
home
evening
was
falling
and
as
i
walked
i
heard
the
crows
calling
and
the
air
was
keen
and
cool
and
i
thought
deep
thoughts
and
so
i
stepped
into
the
darkened
stable
i
could
not
see
the
outlines
of
the
horse
or
the
cow
but
knowing
the
place
so
well
i
could
easily
get
about
i
heard
the
horse
step
aside
with
a
soft
expectant
whinny
i
smelled
the
smell
of
milk
the
musty
sharp
odour
of
dry
hay
the
pungent
smell
of
manure
not
unpleasant
and
the
stable
was
warm
after
the
cool
of
the
fields
with
a
sort
of
animal
warmth
that
struck
into
me
soothingly
i
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
laid
my
hand
on
the
flank
the
flesh
quivered
and
shrunk
away
from
my
touch
coming
back
confidently
warmly
i
ran
my
hand
along
his
back
and
up
his
hairy
neck
i
felt
his
sensitive
nose
in
my
hand
you
shall
have
your
oats
i
said
and
i
gave
him
to
eat
then
i
spoke
as
gently
to
the
cow
and
she
stood
aside
to
be
milked
and
afterward
i
came
out
into
the
clear
bright
night
and
the
air
was
sweet
and
cool
and
my
dog
came
bounding
to
meet
so
i
carried
the
milk
into
the
house
and
harriet
said
in
her
heartiest
tone
you
are
late
david
but
sit
up
i
have
kept
the
biscuits
warm
and
that
night
my
sleep
was
sound
iv
entertain
an
agent
unawares
with
the
coming
of
winter
i
thought
the
life
of
a
farmer
might
lose
something
of
its
charm
so
much
interest
lies
in
the
growth
not
only
of
crops
but
of
trees
vines
flowers
sentiments
and
emotions
in
the
summer
the
world
is
busy
concerned
with
many
things
and
full
of
gossip
in
the
winter
i
anticipated
a
cessation
of
many
active
interests
and
enthusiasms
i
looked
forward
to
having
time
for
my
books
and
for
the
quiet
contemplation
of
the
life
around
me
summer
indeed
is
for
activity
winter
for
reflection
but
when
winter
really
came
every
day
discovered
some
new
work
to
do
or
some
new
adventure
to
enjoy
it
is
surprising
how
many
things
happen
on
a
small
farm
examining
the
book
which
accounts
for
that
winter
i
find
the
history
of
part
of
a
forenoon
which
will
illustrate
one
of
the
curious
adventures
of
a
farmer
life
it
is
dated
january
i
went
out
this
morning
with
my
axe
and
hammer
to
mend
the
fence
along
the
public
road
a
heavy
frost
fell
last
night
and
the
brown
grass
and
the
dry
ruts
of
the
roads
were
powdered
white
even
the
air
which
was
perfectly
still
seemed
full
of
frost
crystals
so
that
when
the
sun
came
up
one
seemed
to
walk
in
a
magic
world
i
drew
in
a
long
breath
and
looked
out
across
the
wonderful
shining
country
and
i
said
to
myself
surely
there
is
nowhere
i
would
rather
be
than
here
for
i
could
have
travelled
nowhere
to
find
greater
beauty
or
a
better
enjoyment
of
it
than
i
had
here
at
home
as
i
worked
with
my
axe
and
hammer
i
heard
a
light
wagon
come
rattling
up
the
road
across
the
valley
a
man
had
begun
to
chop
a
tree
i
could
see
the
axe
steel
flash
brilliantly
in
the
sunshine
before
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
blow
the
man
in
the
wagon
had
a
round
face
and
a
sharp
blue
eye
i
thought
he
seemed
a
businesslike
young
man
say
there
he
shouted
drawing
up
at
my
gate
would
you
mind
holding
my
horse
a
minute
it
a
cold
morning
and
he
restless
certainly
not
i
said
and
i
put
down
my
tools
and
held
his
horse
he
walked
up
to
my
door
with
a
brisk
step
and
a
certain
jaunty
poise
of
the
head
he
is
well
contented
with
himself
i
said
it
is
a
great
blessing
for
any
man
to
be
satisfied
with
what
he
has
got
i
heard
harriet
open
the
door
how
every
sound
rang
through
the
still
morning
air
the
young
man
asked
some
question
and
i
distinctly
heard
answer
he
down
there
the
young
man
came
back
his
hat
was
tipped
up
his
quick
eye
darted
over
my
grounds
as
though
in
a
single
instant
he
had
appraised
everything
and
passed
judgment
upon
the
cash
value
of
the
inhabitants
he
whistled
a
lively
little
tune
say
he
said
when
he
reached
the
gate
not
at
all
disconcerted
i
thought
you
was
the
hired
man
your
name
grayson
ai
it
well
i
want
to
talk
with
you
after
tying
and
blanketing
his
horse
and
taking
a
black
satchel
from
his
buggy
he
led
me
up
to
my
house
i
had
a
pleasurable
sense
of
excitement
and
adventure
here
was
a
new
character
come
to
my
farm
who
knows
i
thought
what
he
may
bring
with
him
who
knows
what
i
may
send
away
by
him
here
in
the
country
we
must
set
our
little
ships
afloat
on
small
streams
hoping
that
somehow
some
day
they
will
reach
the
sea
it
was
interesting
to
see
the
busy
young
man
sit
down
so
confidently
in
our
best
chair
he
said
his
name
was
dixon
and
he
took
out
from
his
satchel
a
book
with
a
fine
showy
cover
he
said
it
was
called
living
selections
from
poet
sage
and
humourist
this
he
told
me
is
only
the
first
of
the
series
we
publish
six
volumes
full
of
literchoor
you
see
what
a
heavy
book
this
is
i
tested
it
in
my
hand
it
was
a
heavy
book
the
entire
set
he
said
weighs
over
ten
pounds
there
are
pages
enough
paper
if
laid
down
flat
end
to
end
to
reach
half
a
mile
i
can
not
quote
his
exact
language
there
was
too
much
of
it
but
he
made
an
impressive
showing
of
the
amount
of
literature
that
could
be
had
at
a
very
low
price
per
pound
dixon
was
a
hypnotist
he
fixed
me
with
his
glittering
eye
and
he
talked
so
fast
and
his
ideas
upon
the
subject
were
so
original
that
he
held
me
spellbound
at
first
i
was
inclined
to
be
provoked
one
does
not
like
to
be
forcibly
hypnotised
but
gradually
the
situation
began
to
amuse
me
the
more
so
when
harriet
came
in
did
you
ever
see
a
more
beautiful
binding
asked
the
agent
holding
his
book
admiringly
at
arm
length
this
up
here
he
said
pointing
to
the
illuminated
cover
is
the
muse
of
poetry
she
is
scattering
flowers
poems
you
know
fine
idea
ai
it
colouring
fine
too
he
jumped
up
quickly
and
laid
the
book
on
my
table
to
the
evident
distress
of
harriet
trims
up
the
room
do
it
he
exclaimed
turning
his
head
a
little
to
one
side
and
observing
the
effect
with
an
expression
of
affectionate
admiration
how
much
i
asked
will
you
sell
the
covers
for
without
the
insides
without
the
insides
yes
i
said
the
binding
will
trim
up
my
table
just
as
well
without
the
insides
i
thought
he
looked
at
me
a
little
suspiciously
but
he
was
evidently
satisfied
by
my
expression
of
countenance
for
he
answered
promptly
oh
but
you
want
the
insides
that
what
the
books
are
for
the
bindings
are
never
sold
alone
he
then
went
on
to
tell
me
the
prices
and
terms
of
payment
until
it
really
seemed
that
it
would
be
cheaper
to
buy
the
books
than
to
let
him
carry
them
away
again
harriet
stood
in
the
doorway
behind
him
frowning
and
evidently
trying
to
catch
my
eye
but
i
kept
my
face
turned
aside
so
that
i
could
not
see
her
signal
of
distress
and
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
young
man
dixon
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
harriet
there
thinking
i
was
being
befooled
and
the
agent
thinking
he
was
befooling
me
and
i
thinking
i
was
befooling
both
of
them
and
all
of
us
wrong
it
was
very
like
life
wherever
you
find
it
finally
i
took
the
book
which
he
had
been
urging
upon
me
at
which
harriet
coughed
meaningly
to
attract
my
attention
she
knew
the
danger
when
i
really
got
my
hands
on
a
book
but
i
made
up
as
innocent
as
a
child
i
opened
the
book
almost
at
random
and
it
was
as
though
walking
down
a
strange
road
i
had
come
upon
an
old
tried
friend
not
seen
before
in
years
for
there
on
the
page
before
me
i
read
the
world
is
too
much
with
us
late
and
soon
getting
and
spending
we
lay
waste
our
powers
little
we
see
in
nature
that
is
ours
we
have
given
our
hearts
away
a
sordid
boon
the
sea
that
bares
her
bosom
to
the
moon
the
winds
that
will
be
howling
at
all
hours
but
are
now
like
sleeping
flowers
for
this
for
everything
we
are
out
of
tune
it
moves
us
not
and
as
i
read
it
came
back
to
me
a
scene
like
a
picture
the
place
the
time
the
very
feel
of
the
hour
when
i
first
saw
those
lines
who
shall
say
that
the
past
does
not
live
an
odour
will
sometimes
set
the
blood
coursing
in
an
old
emotion
and
a
line
of
poetry
is
the
resurrection
and
the
life
for
a
moment
i
forgot
harriet
and
the
agent
i
forgot
myself
i
even
forgot
the
book
on
my
knee
everything
but
that
hour
in
the
past
a
view
of
shimmering
hot
housetops
the
heat
and
dust
and
noise
of
an
august
evening
in
the
city
the
dumb
weariness
of
it
all
the
loneliness
the
longing
for
green
fields
and
then
these
great
lines
of
wordsworth
read
for
the
first
time
flooding
in
upon
me
great
god
i
rather
be
a
pagan
suckled
in
a
creed
outworn
so
might
i
standing
on
this
pleasant
lea
have
glimpses
that
would
make
me
less
forlorn
have
sight
of
proteus
rising
from
the
sea
and
hear
old
triton
blow
his
wreathèd
horn
when
i
had
finished
i
found
myself
standing
in
my
own
room
with
one
arm
raised
and
i
suspect
a
trace
of
tears
in
my
eyes
there
before
the
agent
and
harriet
i
saw
harriet
lift
one
hand
and
drop
it
hopelessly
she
thought
i
was
captured
at
last
i
was
past
saving
and
as
i
looked
at
the
agent
i
saw
grim
conquest
glowing
in
his
eye
so
i
sat
down
not
a
little
embarrassed
by
my
exhibition
when
i
had
intended
to
be
you
like
it
do
you
said
dixon
unctuously
i
do
see
i
said
earnestly
how
you
can
afford
to
sell
such
things
as
this
so
cheap
they
cheap
he
admitted
regretfully
i
suppose
he
wished
he
had
tried
me
with
the
they
are
priceless
i
said
absolutely
priceless
if
you
were
the
only
man
in
the
world
who
had
that
poem
i
think
i
would
deed
you
my
farm
for
it
dixon
proceeded
as
though
it
were
all
settled
to
get
out
his
black
order
book
and
open
it
briskly
for
business
he
drew
his
fountain
pen
capped
it
and
looked
up
at
me
expectantly
my
feet
actually
seemed
slipping
into
some
irresistible
whirlpool
how
well
he
understood
practical
psychology
i
struggled
within
myself
fearing
engulfment
i
was
all
but
lost
shall
i
deliver
the
set
at
once
he
said
or
can
you
wait
until
the
first
of
february
at
that
critical
moment
a
floating
spar
of
an
idea
swept
my
way
and
i
seized
upon
it
as
the
last
hope
of
the
lost
illustration
you
ever
see
a
more
beautiful
binding
i
do
understand
i
said
as
though
i
had
not
heard
his
last
question
how
you
dare
go
about
with
all
this
treasure
upon
you
are
you
not
afraid
of
being
stopped
in
the
road
and
robbed
why
i
seen
the
time
when
if
i
had
known
you
carried
such
things
as
these
such
cures
for
sick
hearts
i
think
i
should
have
stopped
you
myself
say
you
an
odd
one
said
dixon
why
do
you
sell
such
priceless
things
as
these
i
asked
looking
at
him
sharply
why
do
i
sell
them
and
he
looked
still
more
perplexed
to
make
money
of
course
same
reason
you
raise
corn
but
here
is
wealth
i
said
pursuing
my
advantage
if
you
have
these
you
have
something
more
valuable
than
money
dixon
politely
said
nothing
like
a
wise
angler
having
failed
to
land
me
at
the
first
rush
he
let
me
have
line
then
i
thought
of
ruskin
words
nor
can
any
noble
thing
be
wealth
except
to
a
noble
person
and
that
prompted
me
to
say
to
dixon
these
things
are
not
yours
they
are
mine
you
never
owned
them
but
i
will
sell
them
to
you
he
looked
at
me
in
amazement
and
then
glanced
around
evidently
to
discover
if
there
were
a
convenient
way
of
escape
you
all
straight
are
you
he
asked
tapping
his
forehead
anybody
ever
try
to
take
you
up
the
covers
are
yours
i
continued
as
though
i
had
not
heard
him
the
insides
are
mine
and
have
been
for
a
long
time
that
is
why
i
proposed
buying
the
covers
separately
i
opened
his
book
again
i
thought
i
would
see
what
had
been
chosen
for
its
pages
and
i
found
there
many
fine
and
great
things
let
me
read
you
this
i
said
to
dixon
it
has
been
mine
for
a
long
time
i
will
not
sell
it
to
you
i
will
give
it
to
you
outright
the
best
things
are
always
given
having
some
gift
in
imitating
the
scotch
dialect
i
read
november
chill
blaws
loud
wi
angry
sugh
the
shortening
winter
day
is
near
a
close
the
miry
beasts
retreating
frae
the
pleugh
the
trains
o
craws
to
their
repose
the
cotter
frae
his
labour
goes
this
night
his
weekly
moil
is
at
an
end
collects
his
spades
his
mattocks
and
his
hoes
hoping
the
morn
in
ease
and
rest
to
spend
and
weary
the
moor
his
course
does
hameward
bend
so
i
read
the
cotter
saturday
night
i
love
the
poem
very
much
myself
sometimes
reading
it
aloud
not
so
much
for
the
tenderness
of
its
message
though
i
prize
that
too
as
for
the
wonder
of
its
music
compared
with
these
italian
trills
are
tame
the
tickl
ear
no
raptures
raise
i
suppose
i
showed
my
feeling
in
my
voice
as
i
glanced
up
from
time
to
time
i
saw
the
agent
face
change
and
his
look
deepen
and
the
lips
usually
so
energetically
tense
loosen
with
emotion
surely
no
poem
in
all
the
language
conveys
so
perfectly
the
simple
love
of
the
home
the
quiet
joys
hopes
pathos
of
those
who
live
close
to
the
soil
when
i
had
finished
i
stopped
with
the
stanza
beginning
then
homeward
all
take
off
their
way
the
agent
turned
away
his
head
trying
to
brave
out
his
emotion
most
of
us
tremble
before
a
tear
when
we
might
fearlessly
beard
a
tiger
i
moved
up
nearer
to
the
agent
and
put
my
hand
on
his
knee
then
i
read
two
or
three
of
the
other
things
i
found
in
his
wonderful
book
and
once
i
had
him
laughing
and
once
again
i
had
the
tears
in
his
eyes
oh
a
simple
young
man
a
little
crusty
without
but
soft
inside
like
the
rest
of
us
well
it
was
amazing
once
we
began
talking
not
of
books
but
of
life
how
really
eloquent
and
human
he
became
from
being
a
distant
and
uncomfortable
person
he
became
at
once
like
a
near
neighbour
and
friend
it
was
strange
to
me
as
i
have
thought
since
how
he
conveyed
to
us
in
few
words
the
essential
emotional
note
of
his
life
it
was
no
violin
tone
beautifully
complex
with
harmonics
but
the
clear
simple
voice
of
the
flute
it
spoke
of
his
wife
and
his
baby
girl
and
his
home
the
very
incongruity
of
detail
he
told
us
how
he
grew
onions
in
his
back
yard
added
somehow
to
the
homely
glamour
of
the
vision
which
he
gave
us
the
number
of
his
house
the
fact
that
he
had
a
new
cottage
organ
and
that
the
baby
ran
away
and
lost
herself
in
seventeenth
street
were
all
curiously
fabrics
of
his
emotion
it
was
beautiful
to
see
commonplace
facts
grow
phosphorescent
in
the
heat
of
true
feeling
how
little
we
may
come
to
know
romance
by
the
cloak
she
wears
and
how
humble
must
be
he
who
would
surprise
the
heart
of
her
it
was
indeed
with
an
indescribable
thrill
that
i
heard
him
add
the
details
one
by
one
the
mortgage
on
his
place
now
rapidly
being
paid
off
the
brother
who
was
a
plumber
the
who
was
not
a
of
the
comic
papers
and
finally
he
showed
us
the
picture
of
the
wife
and
baby
that
he
had
in
the
cover
of
his
watch
a
fat
baby
with
its
head
resting
on
its
mother
shoulder
mister
he
said
you
think
it
fun
to
ride
around
the
country
like
i
do
and
be
away
from
home
most
of
the
time
but
it
ai
when
i
think
of
minnie
and
the
kid
he
broke
off
sharply
as
if
he
had
suddenly
remembered
the
shame
of
such
confidences
say
he
asked
what
page
is
that
poem
on
i
told
him
one
he
said
when
i
get
home
i
going
to
read
that
to
minnie
she
likes
poetry
and
all
such
things
and
where
that
other
piece
that
tells
how
a
man
feels
when
he
lonesome
say
that
fellow
knew
we
had
a
genuinely
good
time
the
agent
and
i
and
when
he
finally
rose
to
go
i
said
well
i
sold
you
a
new
book
i
see
now
mister
what
you
mean
i
went
down
the
path
with
him
and
began
to
unhitch
his
horse
let
me
let
me
he
said
eagerly
then
he
shook
hands
paused
a
moment
awkwardly
as
if
about
to
say
something
then
sprang
into
his
buggy
without
saying
it
when
he
had
taken
up
his
reins
he
remarked
say
but
you
make
an
agent
you
hypnotise
i
recognised
it
as
the
greatest
compliment
he
could
pay
me
the
craft
compliment
then
he
drove
off
but
pulled
up
before
he
had
gone
five
yards
he
turned
in
his
seat
one
hand
on
the
back
of
it
his
whip
raised
say
he
shouted
and
when
i
walked
up
he
looked
at
me
with
fine
embarrassment
mister
perhaps
you
accept
one
of
these
sets
from
dixon
free
gratis
for
nothing
i
understand
i
said
but
you
know
i
giving
the
books
to
you
and
i
could
take
them
back
again
well
he
said
you
a
good
one
anyhow
again
and
then
suddenly
business
naturally
coming
uppermost
he
remarked
with
great
enthusiasm
you
given
me
a
new
idea
i
sell
carry
them
carefully
man
i
called
after
him
they
are
precious
so
i
went
back
to
my
work
thinking
how
many
fine
people
there
are
in
this
world
if
you
scratch
deep
enough
illustration
horace
it
v
the
the
this
morning
i
broke
my
old
axe
handle
i
went
out
early
while
the
fog
still
filled
the
valley
and
the
air
was
cool
and
moist
as
it
had
come
fresh
from
the
filter
of
the
night
i
drew
a
long
breath
and
let
my
axe
fall
with
all
the
force
i
could
give
it
upon
a
new
oak
log
i
swung
it
unnecessarily
high
for
the
joy
of
doing
it
and
when
it
struck
it
communicated
a
sharp
yet
not
unpleasant
sting
to
the
palms
of
my
hands
the
handle
broke
short
off
at
the
point
where
the
helve
meets
the
steel
the
blade
was
driven
deep
in
the
oak
wood
i
suppose
i
should
have
regretted
my
foolishness
but
i
did
not
the
handle
was
old
and
somewhat
worn
and
the
accident
gave
me
an
indefinable
satisfaction
the
culmination
of
use
that
final
destruction
which
is
the
complement
of
great
effort
this
feeling
was
also
partly
prompted
by
the
thought
of
the
new
helve
i
already
had
in
store
awaiting
just
such
a
catastrophe
having
come
somewhat
painfully
by
that
helve
i
really
wanted
to
see
it
in
use
last
spring
walking
in
my
fields
i
looked
out
along
the
fences
for
a
young
hickory
tree
of
thrifty
second
growth
bare
of
knots
at
least
head
high
without
the
cracks
or
fissures
of
too
rapid
growth
or
the
doziness
of
early
transgression
what
i
desired
was
a
fine
healthy
tree
fitted
for
a
great
purpose
and
i
looked
for
it
as
i
would
look
for
a
perfect
man
to
save
a
failing
cause
at
last
i
found
a
sapling
growing
in
one
of
the
sheltered
angles
of
my
rail
fence
it
was
set
about
by
dry
grass
overhung
by
a
much
larger
cherry
tree
and
bearing
still
its
withered
last
year
leaves
worn
diaphanous
but
curled
delicately
and
of
a
most
beautiful
ash
gray
colour
something
like
the
fabric
of
a
wasp
nest
only
yellower
i
gave
it
a
shake
and
it
sprung
quickly
under
my
hand
like
the
muscle
of
a
good
horse
its
bark
was
smooth
and
trim
its
bole
well
set
and
solid
a
perfect
tree
so
i
came
up
again
with
my
short
axe
and
after
clearing
away
the
grass
and
leaves
with
which
the
wind
had
mulched
it
i
cut
into
the
clean
white
roots
i
had
no
twinge
of
compunction
for
was
this
not
fulfillment
nothing
comes
of
sorrow
for
worthy
sacrifice
when
i
had
laid
the
tree
low
i
clipped
off
the
lower
branches
snapped
off
the
top
with
a
single
clean
stroke
of
the
axe
and
shouldered
as
pretty
a
sapling
stick
as
anyone
ever
laid
his
eyes
upon
i
carried
it
down
to
my
barn
and
put
it
on
the
open
rafters
over
the
cow
stalls
a
cow
stable
is
warm
and
not
too
dry
so
that
a
hickory
log
cures
slowly
without
cracking
or
checking
there
it
lay
for
many
weeks
often
i
cast
my
eyes
up
at
it
with
satisfaction
watching
the
bark
shrink
and
slightly
deepen
in
colour
and
once
i
climbed
up
where
i
could
see
the
minute
seams
making
way
in
the
end
of
the
stick
in
the
summer
i
brought
the
stick
into
the
house
and
put
it
in
the
dry
warm
storeroom
over
the
kitchen
where
i
keep
my
seed
corn
i
do
not
suppose
it
really
needed
further
attention
but
sometimes
when
i
chanced
to
go
into
the
storeroom
i
turned
it
over
with
my
foot
i
felt
a
sort
of
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
it
was
in
preparation
for
service
good
material
for
useful
work
so
it
lay
during
the
autumn
and
far
into
the
winter
one
cold
night
when
i
sat
comfortably
at
my
fireplace
listening
to
the
wind
outside
and
feeling
all
the
ease
of
a
man
at
peace
with
himself
my
mind
took
flight
to
my
snowy
field
sides
and
i
thought
of
the
trees
there
waiting
and
resting
through
the
winter
so
i
came
in
imagination
to
the
particular
corner
in
the
fence
where
i
had
cut
my
hickory
sapling
instantly
i
started
up
much
to
harriet
astonishment
and
made
my
way
mysteriously
up
the
kitchen
stairs
i
would
not
tell
what
i
was
after
i
felt
it
a
sort
of
adventure
almost
like
the
joy
of
seeing
a
friend
long
forgotten
it
was
as
if
my
hickory
stick
had
cried
out
at
last
after
long
chrysalishood
i
am
ready
i
stood
it
on
end
and
struck
it
sharply
with
my
knuckles
it
rang
out
with
a
certain
clear
resonance
i
am
ready
i
sniffed
at
the
end
of
it
it
exhaled
a
peculiar
good
smell
as
of
old
fields
in
the
autumn
i
am
ready
so
i
took
it
under
my
arm
and
carried
it
down
mercy
what
are
you
going
to
do
exclaimed
harriet
deliberately
and
with
malice
aforethought
i
responded
i
am
going
to
litter
up
your
floor
i
have
decided
to
be
reckless
i
do
care
what
happens
having
made
this
declaration
which
harriet
received
with
becoming
disdain
i
laid
the
log
by
the
fireplace
not
too
near
and
went
to
fetch
a
saw
a
hammer
a
small
wedge
and
a
i
split
my
log
into
as
fine
white
sections
as
a
man
ever
saw
every
piece
as
straight
as
morality
and
without
so
much
as
a
sliver
to
mar
it
nothing
is
so
satisfactory
as
to
have
a
task
come
out
in
perfect
time
and
in
good
order
the
little
pieces
of
bark
and
sawdust
i
swept
scrupulously
into
the
fireplace
looking
up
from
time
to
time
to
see
how
harriet
was
taking
it
harriet
was
still
disdainful
making
an
is
like
writing
a
poem
though
i
never
wrote
one
the
material
is
free
enough
but
it
takes
a
poet
to
use
it
some
people
imagine
that
any
fine
thought
is
poetry
but
there
was
never
a
greater
mistake
a
fine
thought
to
become
poetry
must
be
seasoned
in
the
upper
warm
garrets
of
the
mind
for
long
and
long
then
it
must
be
brought
down
and
slowly
carved
into
words
shaped
with
emotion
polished
with
love
else
it
is
no
true
poem
some
people
imagine
that
any
hickory
stick
will
make
an
but
this
is
far
from
the
truth
when
i
had
whittled
away
for
several
evenings
with
my
and
both
of
which
i
keep
sharpened
to
the
keenest
edge
i
found
that
my
work
was
not
progressing
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
this
is
more
of
a
task
i
remarked
one
evening
than
i
had
imagined
harriet
rocking
placidly
in
her
was
mending
a
number
of
pairs
of
new
socks
poor
harriet
lacking
enough
old
holes
to
occupy
her
energies
she
mends
holes
that
may
possibly
appear
a
frugal
person
well
david
she
said
i
warned
you
that
you
could
buy
a
helve
cheaper
than
you
could
make
it
so
i
can
buy
a
book
cheaper
than
i
can
write
it
i
responded
i
felt
somewhat
pleased
with
my
return
shot
though
i
took
pains
not
to
show
it
i
squinted
along
my
hickory
stick
which
was
even
then
beginning
to
assume
rudely
the
outlines
of
an
i
had
made
a
prodigious
pile
of
fine
white
shavings
and
i
was
tired
but
quite
suddenly
there
came
over
me
a
sort
of
love
for
that
length
of
wood
i
sprung
it
affectionately
over
my
knee
i
rubbed
it
up
and
down
with
my
hand
and
then
i
set
it
in
the
corner
behind
the
fireplace
after
all
i
said
for
i
had
really
been
disturbed
by
remark
after
all
power
over
one
thing
gives
us
power
over
everything
when
you
mend
socks
prospectively
into
futurity
harriet
that
is
an
evidence
of
true
greatness
sometimes
i
think
it
does
pay
remarked
harriet
though
she
was
plainly
pleased
pretty
good
socks
i
said
can
be
bought
for
fifteen
cents
a
pair
harriet
looked
at
me
suspiciously
but
i
was
as
sober
as
the
face
of
nature
for
the
next
two
or
three
evenings
i
let
the
stand
alone
in
the
corner
i
hardly
looked
at
it
though
once
in
a
while
when
occupied
with
some
other
work
i
would
remember
or
rather
half
remember
that
i
had
a
pleasure
in
store
for
the
evening
the
very
thought
of
sharp
tools
and
something
to
make
with
them
acts
upon
the
imagination
with
peculiar
zest
so
we
love
to
employ
the
keen
edge
of
the
mind
upon
a
knotty
and
difficult
subject
one
evening
the
scotch
preacher
came
in
we
love
him
very
much
though
he
sometimes
makes
us
laugh
perhaps
in
part
because
he
makes
us
laugh
externally
he
is
a
sort
of
human
cocoanut
rough
brown
shaggy
but
within
he
has
the
true
milk
of
human
kindness
some
of
his
qualities
touch
greatness
his
youth
was
spent
in
stony
places
where
strong
winds
blew
the
trees
where
he
grew
bore
thorns
the
soil
where
he
dug
was
full
of
roots
but
the
crop
was
human
love
he
possesses
that
quality
unusual
in
one
bred
exclusively
in
the
country
of
magnanimity
toward
the
unlike
in
the
country
we
are
tempted
to
throw
stones
at
strange
hats
but
to
the
scotch
preacher
every
man
in
one
way
seems
transparent
to
the
soul
he
sees
the
man
himself
not
his
professions
any
more
than
his
clothes
and
i
never
knew
anyone
who
had
such
an
abiding
disbelief
in
the
wickedness
of
the
human
soul
weakness
he
sees
and
comforts
wickedness
he
can
not
see
when
he
came
in
i
was
busy
whittling
my
it
being
my
pleasure
at
that
moment
to
make
long
thin
curly
shavings
so
light
that
many
of
them
were
caught
on
the
hearth
and
bowled
by
the
draught
straight
to
fiery
destruction
there
is
a
noisy
zest
about
the
scotch
preacher
he
comes
in
stomping
as
we
say
he
must
clear
his
throat
he
must
strike
his
hands
together
he
even
seems
noisy
when
he
unwinds
the
thick
red
tippet
which
he
wears
wound
many
times
around
his
neck
it
takes
him
a
long
time
to
unwind
it
and
he
accomplishes
the
task
with
many
slow
gyrations
of
his
enormous
rough
head
when
he
sits
down
he
takes
merely
the
edge
of
the
chair
spreads
his
stout
legs
apart
sits
as
straight
as
a
post
and
blows
his
nose
with
a
noise
like
the
falling
of
a
tree
his
interest
in
everything
is
prodigious
when
he
saw
what
i
was
doing
he
launched
at
once
upon
an
account
of
the
methods
of
ancient
and
modern
with
true
incidents
of
his
childhood
man
he
exclaimed
you
clean
forgotten
one
of
the
preenciple
refinements
of
the
art
when
you
chop
which
hand
do
you
hold
down
at
the
moment
i
could
have
told
to
save
my
life
so
we
both
got
up
on
our
feet
and
tried
it
the
right
hand
down
i
decided
that
natural
to
me
you
a
normal
chopper
then
said
the
scotch
preacher
as
i
was
thinking
now
let
me
instruct
you
in
the
art
being
your
helve
must
bow
out
so
no
chopper
uses
a
straight
handle
he
fell
to
explaining
with
gusto
the
mysteries
of
the
bowed
handle
and
as
i
listened
i
felt
a
new
and
peculiar
interest
in
my
task
this
was
a
final
perfection
to
be
accomplished
the
finality
of
technique
so
we
sat
with
our
heads
together
talking
helves
and
axes
axes
with
single
blades
and
axes
with
double
blades
and
hand
axes
and
great
choppers
axes
and
the
science
of
felling
trees
with
the
true
philosophy
of
the
last
chip
and
arguments
as
to
the
best
procedure
when
a
log
begins
to
pinch
until
a
listener
would
have
thought
that
the
art
of
the
chopper
included
the
whole
philosophy
of
existence
as
indeed
it
does
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
way
finally
i
rushed
out
and
brought
in
my
old
and
we
set
upon
it
like
true
artists
with
critical
proscription
for
being
a
trivial
product
of
machinery
man
exclaimed
the
preacher
it
has
no
character
now
your
helve
here
being
the
vision
of
your
brain
and
work
of
your
hands
will
interpret
the
thought
of
your
heart
before
the
scotch
preacher
had
finished
his
disquisition
upon
the
art
of
and
its
relations
with
all
other
arts
i
felt
like
peary
discovering
the
pole
in
the
midst
of
the
discourse
while
i
was
soaring
high
the
scotch
preacher
suddenly
stopped
sat
up
and
struck
his
knee
with
a
tremendous
resounding
smack
spoons
he
exclaimed
harriet
and
i
stopped
and
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
spoons
repeated
harriet
spoons
said
the
scotch
preacher
i
not
once
thought
of
my
errand
and
my
wife
told
me
to
come
straight
home
i
more
thoughtless
every
day
then
he
turned
to
harriet
i
been
sent
to
borrow
some
spoons
he
said
spoons
exclaimed
harriet
spoons
answered
the
scotch
preacher
we
invited
friends
for
dinner
and
we
must
have
spoons
but
why
how
i
thought
began
harriet
still
in
astonishment
the
scotch
preacher
squared
around
toward
her
and
cleared
his
throat
it
the
baptisms
he
said
when
a
baby
is
brought
for
baptism
of
course
it
must
have
a
baptismal
gift
what
is
the
best
gift
for
a
baby
a
spoon
so
we
present
it
with
a
spoon
we
discovered
we
had
only
three
spoons
left
and
company
coming
man
is
a
proleefic
neighbourhood
illustration
let
my
axe
fall
he
heaved
a
great
sigh
harriet
rushed
out
and
made
up
a
package
when
she
came
in
i
thought
it
seemed
suspiciously
large
for
spoons
but
the
scotch
preacher
having
again
launched
into
the
lore
of
the
chopper
took
it
without
at
first
perceiving
anything
strange
five
minutes
after
we
had
closed
the
door
upon
him
he
suddenly
returned
holding
up
the
package
this
is
an
uncommonly
heavy
package
he
remarked
did
i
say
go
on
commanded
harriet
your
wife
will
understand
all
right
again
and
his
sturdy
figure
soon
disappeared
in
the
dark
the
impractical
man
exclaimed
harriet
people
impose
on
him
what
was
in
that
package
harriet
oh
i
put
in
a
few
jars
of
jelly
and
a
cake
of
honey
after
a
moment
harriet
looked
up
from
her
work
do
you
know
the
greatest
sorrow
of
the
scotch
preacher
and
his
wife
what
is
it
i
asked
they
have
no
chick
nor
child
of
their
own
said
harriet
it
is
prodigious
the
amount
of
work
required
to
make
a
good
i
mean
to
make
it
according
to
one
standard
i
had
times
of
humorous
discouragement
and
times
of
high
elation
when
it
seemed
to
me
i
could
not
work
fast
enough
weeks
passed
when
i
did
not
touch
the
helve
but
left
it
standing
quietly
in
the
corner
once
or
twice
i
took
it
out
and
walked
about
with
it
as
a
sort
of
cane
much
to
the
secret
amusement
i
think
of
harriet
at
times
harriet
takes
a
really
wicked
delight
in
her
superiority
early
one
morning
in
march
the
dawn
came
with
a
roaring
wind
sleety
snow
drove
down
over
the
hill
the
house
creaked
and
complained
in
every
clapboard
a
blind
of
one
of
the
upper
windows
wrenched
loose
from
its
fastenings
was
driven
shut
with
such
force
that
it
broke
a
window
pane
when
i
rushed
up
to
discover
the
meaning
of
the
clatter
and
to
repair
the
damage
i
found
the
floor
covered
with
peculiar
long
fragments
of
glass
the
pane
having
been
broken
inward
from
the
centre
just
what
i
have
wanted
i
said
to
myself
i
selected
a
few
of
the
best
pieces
and
so
eager
was
i
to
try
them
that
i
got
out
my
before
breakfast
and
sat
scratching
away
when
harriet
came
down
nothing
equals
a
bit
of
broken
glass
for
putting
on
the
final
perfect
touch
to
a
work
of
art
like
an
nothing
will
so
beautifully
and
delicately
trim
out
the
curves
of
the
throat
or
give
a
smoother
turn
to
the
waist
so
with
care
and
an
indescribable
affection
i
added
the
final
touches
trimming
the
helve
until
it
exactly
fitted
my
hand
often
and
often
i
tried
it
in
pantomime
swinging
nobly
in
the
centre
of
the
avoiding
the
lamp
attentive
to
the
feel
of
my
hand
as
it
ran
along
the
helve
i
rubbed
it
down
with
fine
sandpaper
until
it
fairly
shone
with
whiteness
then
i
borrowed
a
red
flannel
cloth
of
harriet
and
having
added
a
few
drops
not
too
much
of
boiled
oil
i
rubbed
the
helve
for
all
i
was
worth
this
i
continued
for
upward
of
an
hour
at
that
time
the
had
taken
on
a
yellowish
shade
very
clear
and
beautiful
i
do
not
think
i
could
have
been
prouder
if
i
had
carved
a
statue
or
built
a
parthenon
i
was
consumed
with
vanity
but
i
set
the
new
helve
in
the
corner
with
the
appearance
of
utter
unconcern
there
i
remarked
it
finished
i
watched
harriet
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
she
made
as
if
to
speak
and
then
held
silent
that
evening
friend
horace
came
in
i
was
glad
to
see
him
horace
is
or
was
a
famous
chopper
i
placed
him
at
the
fireplace
where
his
eye
sooner
or
later
must
fall
upon
my
oh
i
worked
out
my
designs
presently
he
saw
the
helve
picked
it
up
at
once
and
turned
it
over
in
his
hands
i
had
a
suffocating
not
unhumorous
sense
of
i
know
how
a
poet
must
feel
at
hearing
his
first
poem
read
aloud
by
some
other
person
who
does
not
know
its
authorship
i
suffer
and
thrill
with
the
novelist
who
sees
a
stranger
purchase
his
book
in
a
i
felt
as
though
i
stood
that
moment
before
the
great
judge
horace
hefted
it
and
balanced
it
and
squinted
along
it
he
rubbed
it
with
his
thumb
he
rested
one
end
of
it
on
the
floor
and
sprung
it
roughly
david
he
said
severely
where
did
you
git
this
once
when
i
was
a
boy
i
came
home
with
my
hair
wet
my
father
asked
david
have
you
been
swimming
i
had
exactly
the
same
feeling
when
horace
asked
his
question
now
i
am
generally
speaking
a
truthful
man
i
have
written
a
good
deal
about
the
immorality
the
unwisdom
the
the
sinful
wastefulness
of
a
lie
but
at
that
moment
if
harriet
had
not
been
present
and
that
illustrates
one
of
the
purposes
of
society
to
bolster
up
a
morals
i
should
have
evolved
as
large
and
perfect
a
prevarication
as
it
lay
within
me
to
do
cheerfully
but
i
felt
harriet
moral
eye
upon
me
i
was
a
coward
as
well
as
a
sinner
i
faltered
so
long
that
horace
finally
looked
around
at
me
horace
has
no
poetry
in
his
soul
neither
does
he
understand
the
philosophy
of
imperfection
nor
the
art
of
irregularity
it
is
a
tender
shoot
easily
blasted
by
cold
winds
the
creative
instinct
but
persistent
it
has
many
adventitious
buds
a
late
frost
destroying
the
freshness
of
its
early
verdure
may
be
the
means
of
a
richer
growth
in
later
and
more
favourable
days
for
a
week
i
left
my
helve
standing
there
in
the
corner
i
did
not
even
look
at
it
i
was
slain
i
even
thought
of
getting
up
in
the
night
and
putting
the
helve
on
the
coals
secretly
then
suddenly
one
morning
i
took
it
up
not
at
all
tenderly
indeed
with
a
humorous
appreciation
of
my
own
absurdities
and
carried
it
out
into
the
yard
an
is
not
a
mere
ornament
but
a
thing
of
sober
purpose
the
test
after
all
of
is
not
sublime
perfection
but
service
we
may
easily
find
flaws
in
the
verse
of
the
master
how
far
the
rhythm
fails
of
the
final
perfect
music
how
often
uncertain
the
rhyme
but
it
bears
within
it
hidden
yet
evident
that
certain
incalculable
fire
which
kindles
and
will
continue
to
kindle
the
souls
of
men
the
final
test
is
not
the
perfection
of
precedent
not
regularity
but
life
spirit
it
was
one
of
those
perfect
sunny
calm
mornings
that
sometimes
come
in
early
april
the
zest
of
winter
yet
in
the
air
but
a
promise
of
summer
i
built
a
fire
of
oak
chips
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
between
two
flat
stones
i
brought
out
my
old
axe
and
when
the
fire
had
burned
down
somewhat
leaving
a
foundation
of
hot
coals
i
thrust
the
eye
of
the
axe
into
the
fire
the
blade
rested
on
one
of
the
flat
stones
and
i
kept
it
covered
with
wet
rags
in
order
that
it
might
not
heat
sufficiently
to
destroy
the
temper
of
the
steel
harriet
old
gray
hen
a
garrulous
fowl
came
and
stood
on
one
leg
and
looked
at
me
first
with
one
eye
and
then
with
the
other
she
asked
innumerable
impertinent
questions
and
was
generally
disagreeable
i
am
sorry
madam
i
said
finally
but
i
have
grown
adamant
to
criticism
i
have
done
my
work
as
well
as
it
lies
in
me
to
do
it
it
is
the
part
of
sanity
to
throw
it
aside
without
compunction
a
work
must
prove
itself
shoo
i
said
this
with
such
conclusiveness
and
vigour
that
the
critical
old
hen
departed
hastily
with
ruffled
feathers
so
i
sat
there
in
the
glorious
perfection
of
the
forenoon
the
great
day
open
around
me
a
few
small
clouds
abroad
in
the
highest
sky
and
all
the
earth
radiant
with
sunshine
the
last
snow
of
winter
was
gone
the
sap
ran
in
the
trees
the
cows
fed
further
afield
when
the
eye
of
the
axe
was
sufficiently
expanded
by
the
heat
i
drew
it
quickly
from
the
fire
and
drove
home
the
helve
which
i
had
already
whittled
down
to
the
exact
size
i
had
a
hickory
wedge
prepared
and
it
was
the
work
of
ten
seconds
to
drive
it
into
the
cleft
at
the
lower
end
of
the
helve
until
the
eye
of
the
axe
was
completely
and
perfectly
filled
upon
cooling
the
steel
shrunk
upon
the
wood
clasping
it
with
such
firmness
that
nothing
short
of
fire
could
ever
dislodge
it
then
carefully
with
knife
and
sandpaper
i
polished
off
the
wood
around
the
steel
of
the
axe
until
i
had
made
as
good
a
job
of
it
as
lay
within
my
power
so
i
carried
the
axe
to
my
i
swung
it
above
my
head
and
the
feel
of
it
was
good
in
my
hands
the
blade
struck
deep
into
the
oak
wood
and
i
said
to
myself
with
satisfaction
it
serves
the
purpose
vi
the
marsh
ditch
if
the
day
and
the
night
are
such
that
you
greet
them
with
joy
and
life
emits
a
fragrance
like
flowers
and
herbs
is
more
elastic
more
starry
more
immortal
that
is
your
success
in
all
the
days
of
my
life
i
have
never
been
so
well
content
as
i
am
this
spring
last
summer
i
thought
i
was
happy
the
fall
gave
me
a
finality
of
satisfaction
the
winter
imparted
perspective
but
spring
conveys
a
wholly
new
sense
of
life
a
quickening
the
like
of
which
i
never
before
experienced
it
seems
to
me
that
everything
in
the
world
is
more
interesting
more
vital
more
significant
i
feel
like
waving
aside
all
roofs
in
the
way
of
le
sage
asmodeus
i
even
cease
to
fear
horace
who
is
quite
the
most
formidable
person
in
this
neighbourhood
she
is
so
avaricious
in
the
saving
of
souls
and
so
covetous
of
mine
which
i
wish
especially
to
retain
when
i
see
her
coming
across
the
hill
i
feel
like
running
and
hiding
and
if
i
were
as
bold
as
a
boy
i
should
do
it
but
being
a
coward
i
remain
and
dissemble
she
came
over
this
morning
when
i
beheld
her
afar
off
i
drew
a
long
breath
one
thousand
i
quoted
to
myself
shall
flee
at
the
rebuke
of
one
in
calmness
i
waited
she
came
with
colours
flying
and
hurled
her
biblical
lance
when
i
withstood
the
shock
with
unexpected
jauntiness
for
i
usually
fall
dead
at
once
she
looked
at
me
with
severity
and
said
grayson
you
are
a
materialist
you
have
shot
me
with
a
name
i
replied
i
am
unhurt
it
would
be
impossible
to
slay
me
on
a
day
like
this
on
a
day
like
this
i
am
immortal
it
comes
to
me
as
the
wonder
of
wonders
these
spring
days
how
surely
everything
spiritual
as
well
as
material
proceeds
out
of
the
earth
i
have
times
of
sheer
paganism
when
i
could
bow
and
touch
my
face
to
the
warm
bare
soil
we
are
so
often
ashamed
of
the
earth
the
soil
of
it
the
sweat
of
it
the
good
common
coarseness
of
it
to
us
in
our
fine
raiment
and
soft
manners
it
seems
indelicate
instead
of
seeking
that
association
with
the
earth
which
is
the
renewal
of
life
we
devise
ourselves
distant
palaces
and
seek
strange
pleasures
how
often
and
sadly
we
repeat
the
life
story
of
the
yellow
dodder
of
the
moist
lanes
of
my
lower
farm
it
springs
up
fresh
and
clean
from
the
earth
itself
and
spreads
its
clinging
viny
stems
over
the
hospitable
wild
balsam
and
golden
rod
in
a
week
time
having
reached
the
warm
sunshine
of
the
upper
air
it
forgets
its
humble
beginnings
its
roots
wither
swiftly
and
die
out
but
the
sickly
yellow
stems
continue
to
flourish
and
spread
drawing
their
nourishment
not
from
the
soil
itself
but
by
strangling
and
sucking
the
life
juices
of
the
hosts
on
which
it
feeds
i
have
seen
whole
byways
covered
thus
with
yellow
dodder
rootless
leafless
parasitic
reaching
up
to
the
sunlight
quite
cutting
off
and
smothering
the
plants
which
gave
it
life
a
week
or
two
it
flourishes
and
then
most
of
it
perishes
miserably
so
many
of
us
come
to
be
like
that
so
much
of
our
civilization
is
like
that
men
and
women
there
are
the
pity
of
it
who
eating
plentifully
have
never
themselves
taken
a
mouthful
from
the
earth
they
have
never
known
a
moment
real
life
of
their
own
lying
up
to
the
sun
in
warmth
and
comfort
but
leafless
they
do
not
think
of
the
hosts
under
them
smothered
strangled
starved
they
take
at
first
hand
they
experience
described
emotion
and
think
prepared
thoughts
they
live
not
in
life
but
in
printed
reports
of
life
they
gather
the
odour
of
odours
not
the
odour
itself
they
do
not
hear
they
overhear
a
poor
sad
existence
bring
out
your
social
remedies
they
will
fail
they
will
fail
every
one
until
each
man
has
his
feet
somewhere
upon
the
soil
my
wild
plum
trees
grow
in
the
coarse
earth
among
excrementitious
mould
a
physical
life
which
finally
blossoms
and
exhales
its
perfect
odour
which
ultimately
bears
the
seed
of
its
immortality
human
happiness
is
the
true
odour
of
growth
the
sweet
exhalation
of
work
and
the
seed
of
human
immortality
is
borne
secretly
within
the
coarse
and
mortal
husk
so
many
of
us
crave
the
odour
without
cultivating
the
earthly
growth
from
which
it
proceeds
so
many
wasting
mortality
expect
immortality
why
asks
charles
baxter
do
you
always
put
the
end
of
your
stories
first
you
may
be
thankful
i
replied
that
i
do
not
make
my
remarks
all
endings
endings
are
so
much
more
interesting
than
beginnings
without
looking
up
from
the
buggy
he
was
mending
charles
baxter
intimated
that
my
way
had
at
least
one
advantage
one
always
knew
he
said
that
i
really
had
an
end
in
view
and
hope
deferred
he
said
how
surely
soundly
deeply
the
physical
underlies
the
spiritual
this
morning
i
was
up
and
out
at
four
as
perfect
a
morning
as
i
ever
saw
mists
yet
huddled
in
the
low
spots
the
sun
coming
up
over
the
hill
and
all
the
earth
fresh
with
moisture
sweet
with
good
odours
and
musical
with
early
it
is
the
time
of
the
spring
just
after
the
last
seeding
and
before
the
early
haying
a
in
the
farmer
year
i
have
been
utilising
it
in
digging
a
drainage
ditch
at
the
lower
end
of
my
farm
a
spot
of
marsh
grass
and
blue
flags
occupies
nearly
half
an
acre
of
good
land
and
i
have
been
planning
ever
since
i
bought
the
place
to
open
a
drain
from
its
lower
edge
to
the
creek
supplementing
it
in
the
field
above
if
necessary
with
submerged
tiling
i
surveyed
it
carefully
several
weeks
ago
and
drew
plans
and
contours
of
the
work
as
though
it
were
an
canal
i
find
it
a
real
delight
to
work
out
in
the
earth
itself
the
details
of
the
drawing
this
morning
after
hastening
with
the
chores
i
took
my
bag
and
my
spade
on
my
shoulder
and
set
off
in
rubber
boots
for
the
ditch
my
way
lay
along
the
margin
of
my
cornfield
in
the
deep
grass
on
my
right
as
i
walked
was
the
old
rail
fence
full
of
thrifty
young
hickory
and
cherry
trees
with
here
and
there
a
clump
of
blackberry
bushes
the
trees
beyond
the
fence
cut
off
the
sunrise
so
that
i
walked
in
the
cool
broad
shadows
on
my
left
stretched
the
cornfield
of
my
planting
the
young
corn
well
up
very
attractive
and
hopeful
my
really
frightful
scarecrow
standing
guard
on
the
knoll
a
wisp
of
straw
sticking
up
through
a
hole
in
his
hat
and
his
crooked
thumbs
turned
down
no
mercy
surely
no
corn
ever
before
grew
like
this
i
said
to
myself
i
must
begin
cultivating
again
so
i
looked
up
and
about
me
not
to
miss
anything
of
the
morning
and
i
drew
in
a
good
big
breath
and
i
thought
the
world
had
never
been
so
open
to
my
senses
i
wonder
why
it
is
that
the
sense
of
smell
is
so
commonly
to
me
it
is
the
source
of
some
of
my
greatest
pleasures
no
one
of
the
senses
is
more
often
allied
with
robustity
of
physical
health
a
man
who
smells
acutely
may
be
set
down
as
enjoying
that
which
is
normal
plain
wholesome
he
does
not
require
seasoning
the
ordinary
earth
is
good
enough
for
him
he
is
likely
to
be
sane
which
means
sound
healthy
in
his
outlook
upon
life
of
all
hours
of
the
day
there
is
none
like
the
early
morning
for
downright
good
odours
the
morning
before
eating
fresh
from
sleep
and
unclogged
with
food
a
man
senses
cut
like
knives
the
whole
world
comes
in
upon
him
a
still
morning
is
best
for
the
mists
and
the
moisture
seem
to
retain
the
odours
which
they
have
distilled
through
the
night
upon
a
breezy
morning
one
is
likely
to
get
a
single
predominant
odour
as
of
clover
when
the
wind
blows
across
a
hay
field
or
of
apple
blossoms
when
the
wind
comes
through
the
orchard
but
upon
a
perfectly
still
morning
it
is
wonderful
how
the
odours
arrange
themselves
in
upright
strata
so
that
one
walking
passes
through
them
as
from
room
to
room
in
a
marvellous
temple
of
fragrance
i
should
have
said
i
think
if
i
had
not
been
on
my
way
to
dig
a
ditch
that
it
was
like
turning
the
leaves
of
some
delicate
volume
of
lyrics
so
it
was
this
morning
as
i
walked
along
the
margin
of
my
field
i
was
conscious
at
first
coming
within
the
shadows
of
the
wood
of
the
cool
heavy
aroma
which
one
associates
with
the
night
as
of
moist
woods
and
earth
mould
the
penetrating
scent
of
the
night
remains
long
after
the
sights
and
sounds
of
it
have
disappeared
in
sunny
spots
i
had
the
fragrance
of
the
open
cornfield
the
aromatic
breath
of
the
brown
earth
giving
curiously
the
sense
of
fecundity
a
warm
generous
odour
of
daylight
and
sunshine
down
the
field
toward
the
corner
cutting
in
sharply
as
though
a
door
opened
or
a
page
turned
to
another
lyric
came
the
cloying
sweet
fragrance
of
wild
blossoms
almost
tropical
in
their
richness
and
below
that
as
i
came
to
my
work
the
thin
acrid
smell
of
the
marsh
the
place
of
the
rushes
and
the
flags
and
the
frogs
how
few
of
us
really
use
our
senses
i
mean
give
ourselves
fully
at
any
time
to
the
occupation
of
the
senses
we
do
not
expect
to
understand
a
treatise
on
economics
without
applying
our
minds
to
it
nor
can
we
really
smell
or
hear
or
see
or
feel
without
every
faculty
alert
through
sheer
indolence
we
miss
half
the
joy
of
the
world
often
as
i
work
i
stop
to
see
really
see
see
everything
or
to
listen
and
it
is
the
wonder
of
wonders
how
much
there
is
in
this
old
world
which
we
never
dreamed
of
how
many
beautiful
curious
interesting
sights
and
sounds
there
are
which
ordinarily
make
no
impression
upon
our
clogged
overfed
and
preoccupied
minds
i
have
also
had
the
feeling
it
may
be
unscientific
but
it
is
comforting
that
any
man
might
see
like
an
indian
or
smell
like
a
hound
if
he
gave
to
the
senses
the
brains
which
the
indian
and
the
hound
apply
to
them
and
i
pretty
sure
about
the
indian
it
is
marvellous
what
a
man
can
do
when
he
puts
his
entire
mind
upon
one
faculty
and
bears
down
hard
so
i
walked
this
morning
not
hearing
nor
seeing
but
smelling
without
desiring
to
stir
up
strife
among
the
peaceful
senses
there
is
this
further
marvel
of
the
sense
of
smell
no
other
possesses
such
an
sight
preserves
pictures
the
complete
view
of
the
aspect
of
objects
but
it
is
photographic
and
external
hearing
deals
in
echoes
but
the
sense
of
smell
while
saving
no
vision
of
a
place
or
a
person
will
in
a
way
almost
miraculous
the
inner
of
a
particular
time
or
place
i
know
of
nothing
that
will
so
create
an
appetite
under
the
ribs
of
death
only
a
short
time
ago
i
passed
an
open
doorway
in
the
town
i
was
busy
with
errands
my
mind
fully
engaged
but
suddenly
i
caught
an
odour
from
somewhere
within
the
building
i
was
passing
i
stopped
it
was
as
if
in
that
moment
i
lost
twenty
years
of
my
life
i
was
a
boy
again
living
and
feeling
a
particular
instant
at
the
time
of
my
father
death
every
emotion
of
that
occasion
not
recalled
in
years
returned
to
me
sharply
and
clearly
as
though
i
experienced
it
for
the
first
time
it
was
a
peculiar
emotion
the
first
time
i
had
ever
felt
the
oppression
of
space
can
i
describe
it
the
utter
bigness
of
the
world
and
the
aloofness
of
myself
a
little
boy
within
it
now
that
my
father
was
gone
it
was
not
at
that
moment
sorrow
nor
remorse
nor
love
it
was
an
inexpressible
cold
terror
that
anywhere
i
might
go
in
the
world
i
should
still
be
alone
and
there
i
stood
a
man
grown
shaking
in
the
sunshine
with
that
old
boyish
emotion
brought
back
to
me
by
an
odour
often
and
often
have
i
known
this
strange
rekindling
of
dead
fires
and
i
have
thought
how
if
our
senses
were
really
perfect
we
might
lose
nothing
out
of
our
lives
neither
sights
nor
sounds
nor
emotions
a
sort
of
mortal
immortality
was
not
shakespeare
great
because
he
lost
less
of
the
savings
of
his
senses
than
other
men
what
a
wonderful
seer
hearer
smeller
taster
feeler
he
must
have
been
and
how
all
the
time
his
mind
must
have
played
upon
the
gatherings
of
his
senses
all
scenes
all
men
the
very
turn
of
a
head
the
exact
sound
of
a
voice
the
taste
of
food
the
feel
of
the
world
all
the
emotions
of
his
life
must
he
have
had
there
before
him
as
he
wrote
his
great
mind
playing
upon
them
reconstructing
and
putting
them
down
hot
upon
his
pages
there
is
nothing
strange
about
great
men
they
are
like
us
only
deeper
higher
broader
they
think
as
we
do
but
with
more
intensity
they
suffer
as
we
do
more
keenly
they
love
as
we
do
more
tenderly
i
may
be
the
sense
of
smell
but
it
is
only
because
i
walked
this
morning
in
a
world
of
odours
the
greatest
of
the
senses
of
course
is
not
smell
or
hearing
but
sight
what
would
not
any
man
exchange
for
that
for
the
faces
one
loves
for
the
scenes
one
holds
most
dear
for
all
that
is
beautiful
and
changeable
and
beyond
description
the
scotch
preacher
says
that
the
saddest
lines
in
all
literature
are
those
of
milton
writing
of
his
blindness
seasons
return
but
not
to
me
returns
day
or
the
sweet
approach
of
even
or
morn
or
sight
of
vernal
bloom
or
summer
rose
or
flocks
or
herds
or
human
face
divine
i
have
wandered
a
long
way
from
but
not
wholly
without
intention
sooner
or
later
i
try
to
get
back
into
the
main
road
i
throw
down
my
spade
in
the
wet
trampled
grass
at
the
edge
of
the
ditch
i
take
off
my
coat
and
hang
it
over
a
limb
of
the
little
hawthorn
tree
i
put
my
bag
near
it
i
roll
up
the
sleeves
of
my
flannel
shirt
i
give
my
hat
a
twirl
i
ready
for
work
the
senses
are
the
tools
by
which
we
lay
hold
upon
the
world
they
are
the
implements
of
consciousness
and
growth
so
long
as
they
are
used
upon
the
good
earth
used
to
wholesome
weariness
they
remain
healthy
they
yield
enjoyment
they
nourish
growth
but
let
them
once
be
removed
from
their
natural
employment
and
they
turn
and
feed
upon
themselves
they
seek
the
stimulation
of
luxury
they
wallow
in
their
own
corruption
and
finally
worn
out
perish
from
off
the
earth
which
they
have
not
appreciated
vice
is
ever
the
senses
gone
astray
so
i
dug
there
is
something
fine
in
hard
physical
labour
straight
ahead
no
brain
used
just
muscles
i
stood
in
the
cool
water
every
spadeful
came
out
with
a
smack
and
as
i
turned
it
over
at
the
edge
of
the
ditch
small
turgid
rivulets
coursed
back
again
i
did
not
think
of
anything
in
particular
i
dug
a
peculiar
joy
attends
the
very
pull
of
the
muscles
i
drove
the
spade
home
with
one
foot
then
i
bent
and
lifted
and
turned
with
a
sort
of
physical
satisfaction
difficult
to
describe
at
first
i
had
the
cool
of
the
morning
but
by
seven
the
day
was
hot
enough
i
opened
the
breast
of
my
shirt
gave
my
sleeves
another
roll
and
went
at
it
again
for
half
an
hour
until
i
dripped
with
perspiration
i
will
knock
off
i
said
so
i
used
my
spade
as
a
ladder
and
climbed
out
of
the
ditch
being
very
thirsty
i
walked
down
through
the
marshy
valley
to
the
clump
of
alders
which
grows
along
the
creek
i
followed
a
through
the
thicket
and
came
to
the
creek
side
where
i
knelt
on
a
log
and
took
a
good
long
drink
then
i
soused
my
head
in
the
cool
stream
dashed
the
water
upon
my
arms
and
came
up
dripping
and
gasping
oh
but
it
was
fine
so
i
came
back
to
the
hawthorn
tree
where
i
sat
down
comfortably
and
stretched
my
legs
there
is
a
poem
in
stretched
legs
after
hard
digging
but
i
ca
write
it
though
i
can
feel
it
i
got
my
bag
and
took
out
a
half
loaf
of
harriet
bread
breaking
off
big
crude
pieces
i
ate
it
there
in
the
shade
how
rarely
we
taste
the
real
taste
of
bread
we
disguise
it
with
butter
we
toast
it
we
eat
it
with
milk
or
fruit
we
even
soak
it
with
gravy
here
in
the
country
where
we
at
all
polite
but
very
comfortable
so
that
we
never
get
the
downright
delicious
taste
of
the
bread
itself
i
was
hungry
this
morning
and
i
ate
my
half
loaf
to
the
last
crumb
and
wanted
more
then
i
lay
down
for
a
moment
in
the
shade
and
looked
up
into
the
sky
through
the
thin
outer
branches
of
the
hawthorn
a
turkey
buzzard
was
lazily
circling
above
me
a
frog
boomed
intermittently
from
the
little
marsh
and
there
were
bees
at
work
in
the
blossoms
i
had
another
drink
at
the
creek
and
went
back
somewhat
reluctantly
i
confess
to
the
work
it
was
hot
and
the
first
joy
of
effort
had
worn
off
but
the
ditch
was
to
be
dug
and
i
went
at
it
again
one
becomes
a
sort
of
machine
unthinking
mechanical
and
yet
intense
physical
work
though
making
no
immediate
impression
on
the
mind
often
lingers
in
the
consciousness
i
find
that
sometimes
i
can
remember
and
enjoy
for
long
afterward
every
separate
step
in
a
task
it
is
curious
hard
physical
labour
one
actually
stops
thinking
i
often
work
long
without
any
thought
whatever
so
far
as
i
know
save
that
connected
with
the
monotonous
repetition
of
the
labour
itself
down
with
the
spade
out
with
it
up
with
it
over
with
it
and
repeat
and
yet
sometimes
mostly
in
the
forenoon
when
i
am
not
at
all
tired
i
will
suddenly
have
a
sense
as
of
the
world
opening
around
me
a
sense
of
its
beauty
and
its
meanings
giving
me
a
peculiar
deep
happiness
that
is
near
complete
content
happiness
i
have
discovered
is
nearly
always
a
rebound
from
hard
work
it
is
one
of
the
follies
of
men
to
imagine
that
they
can
enjoy
mere
thought
or
emotion
or
sentiment
as
well
try
to
eat
beauty
for
happiness
must
be
tricked
she
loves
to
see
men
at
work
she
loves
sweat
weariness
she
will
be
found
not
in
palaces
but
lurking
in
cornfields
and
factories
and
hovering
over
littered
desks
she
crowns
the
unconscious
head
of
the
busy
child
if
you
look
up
suddenly
from
hard
work
you
will
see
her
but
if
you
look
too
long
she
fades
sorrowfully
away
down
toward
the
town
there
is
a
little
factory
for
barrel
hoops
and
staves
it
has
one
of
the
most
musical
whistles
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
it
toots
at
exactly
twelve
blessed
sound
the
last
at
is
a
hard
slow
pull
i
warm
and
tired
but
i
stick
down
to
it
and
wait
with
straining
ear
for
the
music
at
the
very
first
note
of
that
whistle
i
drop
my
spade
i
will
even
empty
out
a
load
of
dirt
half
way
up
rather
than
expend
another
ounce
of
energy
and
i
spring
out
of
the
ditch
and
start
for
home
with
a
single
desire
in
my
heart
or
possibly
lower
down
and
harriet
standing
in
the
doorway
seems
to
me
a
sort
of
angel
a
culinary
angel
talk
of
joy
there
may
be
things
better
than
beef
stew
and
baked
potatoes
and
bread
there
may
be
vii
an
argument
with
a
millionnaire
let
the
mighty
and
great
roll
in
splendour
and
state
i
envy
them
not
i
declare
it
i
eat
my
own
lamb
my
own
chicken
and
ham
i
shear
my
own
sheep
and
wear
it
i
have
lawns
i
have
bowers
i
have
fruits
i
have
flowers
the
lark
is
my
morning
charmer
so
you
jolly
dogs
now
here
god
bless
the
plow
long
life
and
content
to
the
farmer
on
an
old
pitcher
of
english
i
have
been
hearing
of
john
starkweather
ever
since
i
came
here
he
is
a
most
important
personage
in
this
community
he
is
rich
horace
especially
loved
to
talk
about
him
give
horace
half
a
chance
whether
the
subject
be
pigs
or
churches
and
he
will
break
in
somewhere
with
the
remark
as
i
was
saying
to
starkweather
or
starkweather
says
to
me
how
we
love
to
shine
by
reflected
glory
even
harriet
has
not
gone
unscathed
she
too
has
been
affected
by
the
bacillus
of
admiration
she
has
wanted
to
know
several
times
if
i
saw
john
starkweather
drive
by
the
finest
span
of
horses
in
this
country
she
says
and
you
see
his
daughter
much
other
information
concerning
the
starkweather
household
culinary
and
otherwise
is
current
among
our
hills
we
know
accurately
the
number
of
starkweather
bedrooms
we
can
tell
how
much
coal
he
uses
in
winter
and
how
many
tons
of
ice
in
summer
and
upon
such
important
premises
we
argue
his
riches
several
times
i
have
passed
john
starkweather
home
it
lies
between
my
farm
and
the
town
though
not
on
the
direct
road
and
it
is
really
beautiful
with
the
groomed
and
guided
beauty
possible
to
wealth
a
stately
old
house
with
a
huge
end
chimney
of
red
brick
stands
with
dignity
well
back
from
the
road
round
about
lie
pleasant
lawns
that
once
were
cornfields
and
there
are
drives
and
walks
and
exotic
shrubs
at
first
loving
my
own
hills
so
well
i
was
puzzled
to
understand
why
i
should
also
enjoy
starkweather
groomed
surroundings
but
it
came
to
me
that
after
all
much
as
we
may
love
wildness
we
are
not
wild
nor
our
works
what
more
artificial
than
a
house
or
a
barn
or
a
fence
and
the
greater
and
more
formal
the
house
the
more
formal
indeed
must
be
the
nearer
natural
environments
perhaps
the
hand
of
man
might
well
have
been
less
evident
in
developing
the
surroundings
of
the
starkweather
home
for
art
dealing
with
nature
is
so
often
too
accomplished
but
i
enjoy
the
starkweather
place
and
as
i
look
in
from
the
road
i
sometimes
think
to
myself
with
satisfaction
here
is
this
rich
man
who
has
paid
his
thousands
to
make
the
beauty
which
i
pass
and
take
for
nothing
and
having
taken
leave
as
much
behind
and
i
wonder
sometimes
whether
he
inside
his
fences
gets
more
joy
of
it
than
i
who
walk
the
roads
outside
anyway
i
am
grateful
to
him
for
using
his
riches
so
much
to
my
advantage
on
fine
mornings
john
starkweather
sometimes
comes
out
in
his
slippers
his
white
vest
gleaming
in
the
sunshine
and
walks
slowly
around
his
garden
charles
baxter
says
that
on
these
occasions
he
is
asking
his
gardener
the
names
of
the
vegetables
however
that
may
be
he
has
seemed
to
our
community
the
very
incarnation
of
contentment
and
prosperity
his
position
the
acme
of
desirability
what
was
my
astonishment
then
the
other
morning
to
see
john
starkweather
coming
down
the
pasture
lane
through
my
farm
i
knew
him
afar
off
though
i
had
never
met
him
may
i
express
the
inexpressible
when
i
say
he
had
a
rich
look
he
walked
rich
there
was
richness
in
the
confident
crook
of
his
elbow
and
in
the
positive
twitch
of
the
stick
he
carried
a
man
accustomed
to
having
doors
opened
before
he
knocked
i
stood
there
a
moment
and
looked
up
the
hill
at
him
and
i
felt
that
profound
curiosity
which
every
one
of
us
feels
every
day
of
his
life
to
know
something
of
the
inner
impulses
which
stir
his
nearest
neighbour
i
should
have
liked
to
know
john
starkweather
but
i
thought
to
myself
as
i
have
thought
so
many
times
how
surely
one
comes
finally
to
imitate
his
surroundings
a
farmer
grows
to
be
a
part
of
his
farm
the
sawdust
on
his
coat
is
not
the
most
distinctive
insignia
of
the
carpenter
the
poet
writes
his
truest
lines
upon
his
own
countenance
people
passing
in
my
road
take
me
to
be
a
part
of
this
natural
scene
i
suppose
i
seem
to
them
as
a
partridge
squatting
among
dry
grass
and
leaves
so
like
the
grass
and
leaves
as
to
be
invisible
we
all
come
to
be
marked
upon
by
nature
and
dismissed
how
carelessly
as
genera
or
species
and
is
it
not
the
primal
struggle
of
man
to
escape
classification
to
form
new
differentiations
sometimes
i
confess
it
when
i
see
one
passing
in
my
road
i
feel
like
hailing
him
and
saying
friend
i
am
not
all
farmer
i
too
am
a
person
i
am
different
and
curious
i
am
full
of
red
blood
i
like
people
all
sorts
of
people
if
you
are
not
interested
in
me
at
least
i
am
intensely
interested
in
you
come
over
now
and
let
talk
so
we
are
all
of
us
calling
and
calling
across
the
incalculable
gulfs
which
separate
us
even
from
our
nearest
friends
once
or
twice
this
feeling
has
been
so
real
to
me
that
i
been
near
to
the
point
of
hailing
utter
strangers
only
to
be
instantly
overcome
with
a
sense
of
the
humorous
absurdity
of
such
an
enterprise
so
i
laugh
it
off
and
i
say
to
myself
steady
now
the
man
is
going
to
town
to
sell
a
pig
he
is
coming
back
with
ten
pounds
of
sugar
five
of
salt
pork
a
can
of
coffee
and
some
new
blades
for
his
mowing
machine
he
has
time
for
talk
and
so
i
come
down
with
a
bump
to
my
digging
or
hoeing
or
chopping
or
whatever
it
is
here
i
left
john
starkweather
in
my
pasture
while
i
remark
to
the
extent
of
a
page
or
two
that
i
did
expect
him
to
see
me
when
he
went
by
i
assumed
that
he
was
out
for
a
walk
perhaps
to
enliven
a
worn
appetite
do
you
know
confidentially
i
had
some
pleasure
in
times
past
in
reflecting
upon
the
jaded
appetites
of
millionnaires
and
that
he
would
pass
out
by
my
lane
to
the
country
road
but
instead
of
that
what
should
he
do
but
climb
the
yard
fence
and
walk
over
toward
the
barn
where
i
was
at
work
perhaps
i
was
not
consumed
with
excitement
here
was
fresh
adventure
a
farmer
i
said
to
myself
with
exultation
has
only
to
wait
long
enough
and
all
the
world
comes
his
way
i
had
just
begun
to
grease
my
farm
wagon
and
was
experiencing
some
difficulty
in
lifting
and
steadying
the
heavy
rear
axle
while
i
took
off
the
wheel
i
kept
busily
at
work
pretending
such
is
the
perversity
of
the
human
mind
that
i
did
not
see
starkweather
he
stood
for
a
moment
watching
me
then
he
said
good
morning
sir
i
looked
up
and
said
oh
good
morning
nice
little
farm
you
have
here
it
enough
for
me
i
replied
i
did
not
especially
like
the
little
one
is
human
then
i
had
an
absurd
inspiration
he
stood
there
so
trim
and
jaunty
and
prosperous
so
rich
i
had
a
good
look
at
him
he
was
dressed
in
a
woollen
jacket
coat
and
leggins
on
his
head
he
wore
a
jaunty
cocky
little
scotch
cap
a
man
i
should
judge
about
fifty
years
old
and
hearty
in
appearance
with
grayish
hair
and
a
eye
i
acted
on
my
inspiration
you
arrived
i
said
at
the
psychological
moment
how
that
take
hold
here
and
help
me
lift
this
axle
and
steady
it
i
having
a
hard
time
of
it
the
look
of
astonishment
in
his
countenance
was
beautiful
to
see
for
a
moment
failure
stared
me
in
the
face
his
expression
said
with
emphasis
perhaps
you
do
know
who
i
am
but
i
looked
at
him
with
the
greatest
good
feeling
and
my
expression
said
or
i
meant
it
to
say
to
be
sure
i
do
and
what
difference
does
it
make
anyway
you
take
hold
there
i
said
without
waiting
for
him
to
catch
his
breath
and
i
get
hold
here
together
we
can
easily
get
the
wheel
off
without
a
word
he
set
his
cane
against
the
barn
and
bent
his
back
up
came
the
axle
and
i
propped
it
with
a
board
now
i
said
you
hang
on
there
and
steady
it
while
i
get
the
wheel
off
though
indeed
it
did
really
need
much
steadying
as
i
straightened
up
whom
should
i
see
but
harriet
standing
transfixed
in
the
pathway
half
way
down
to
the
barn
transfixed
with
horror
she
had
recognised
john
starkweather
and
had
heard
at
least
part
of
what
i
said
to
him
and
the
vision
of
that
important
man
bending
his
back
to
help
lift
the
axle
of
my
old
wagon
was
too
terrible
she
caught
my
eye
and
pointed
and
mouthed
when
i
smiled
and
nodded
john
starkweather
straightened
up
and
looked
around
do
on
your
life
i
warned
let
go
of
that
axle
he
held
on
and
harriet
turned
and
retreated
ingloriously
john
starkweather
face
was
a
study
did
you
ever
grease
a
wagon
i
asked
him
genially
never
he
said
there
more
of
an
art
in
it
than
you
think
i
said
and
as
i
worked
i
talked
to
him
of
the
lore
of
and
showed
him
exactly
how
to
put
it
on
neither
too
much
nor
too
little
and
so
that
it
would
distribute
itself
evenly
when
the
wheel
was
replaced
there
a
right
way
of
doing
everything
i
observed
that
so
said
john
starkweather
if
i
could
only
get
workmen
that
believed
it
by
that
time
i
could
see
that
he
was
beginning
to
be
interested
i
put
back
the
wheel
gave
it
a
light
turn
and
screwed
on
the
nut
he
helped
me
with
the
other
end
of
the
axle
with
all
good
humour
perhaps
i
said
as
engagingly
as
i
knew
how
you
like
to
try
the
art
yourself
you
take
the
grease
this
time
and
i
steady
the
wagon
all
right
he
said
laughing
i
in
for
anything
he
took
the
grease
box
and
the
paddle
less
gingerly
than
i
thought
he
would
is
that
right
he
demanded
and
so
he
put
on
the
grease
and
oh
it
was
good
to
see
harriet
in
the
doorway
steady
there
i
said
not
so
much
at
the
end
now
put
the
box
down
on
the
reach
and
so
together
we
greased
the
wagon
talking
all
the
time
in
the
friendliest
way
i
actually
believe
that
he
was
having
a
pretty
good
time
at
least
it
had
the
virtue
of
unexpectedness
he
was
bored
when
he
had
finished
we
both
straightened
our
backs
and
looked
at
each
other
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
then
we
both
laughed
he
all
right
i
said
to
myself
i
held
up
my
hands
then
he
held
up
his
it
was
hardly
necessary
to
prove
that
was
not
a
delicate
operation
it
a
good
wholesome
sign
i
said
but
it
come
off
do
you
happen
to
remember
a
story
of
tolstoi
called
ivan
the
fool
what
is
a
farmer
doing
quoting
tolstoi
remarked
his
countenance
though
he
said
not
a
word
in
the
kingdom
of
ivan
you
remember
i
said
it
was
the
rule
that
whoever
had
hard
places
on
his
hands
came
to
table
but
whoever
had
not
must
eat
what
the
others
left
thus
i
led
him
up
to
the
back
steps
and
poured
him
a
basin
of
hot
water
which
i
brought
myself
from
the
kitchen
harriet
having
marvellously
and
completely
disappeared
we
both
washed
our
hands
talking
with
great
good
humour
when
we
had
finished
i
said
sit
down
friend
if
you
time
and
let
talk
so
he
sat
down
on
one
of
the
logs
of
my
woodpile
a
solid
sort
of
man
rather
warm
after
his
recent
activities
he
looked
me
over
with
some
interest
and
i
thought
friendliness
why
does
a
man
like
you
he
asked
finally
waste
himself
on
a
little
farm
back
here
in
the
country
for
a
single
instant
i
came
nearer
to
being
angry
than
i
have
been
for
a
long
time
myself
so
we
are
judged
without
knowledge
i
had
a
sudden
impulse
to
demolish
him
if
i
could
with
the
nearest
sarcasms
i
could
lay
hand
to
he
was
so
sure
of
himself
oh
well
i
thought
with
vainglorious
superiority
he
does
know
so
i
said
what
would
you
have
me
be
a
millionnaire
he
smiled
but
with
a
sort
of
sincerity
you
might
be
he
said
who
can
tell
i
laughed
outright
the
humour
of
it
struck
me
as
delicious
here
i
had
been
ever
since
i
first
heard
of
john
starkweather
rather
gloating
over
him
as
a
poor
suffering
millionnaire
of
course
millionnaires
unhappy
and
there
he
sat
ruddy
of
face
and
hearty
of
body
pitying
for
a
poor
unfortunate
farmer
back
here
in
the
country
curious
this
human
nature
of
ours
is
it
but
how
infinitely
beguiling
so
i
sat
down
beside
starkweather
on
the
log
and
crossed
my
legs
i
felt
as
though
i
had
set
foot
in
a
new
country
would
you
really
advise
me
i
asked
to
start
in
to
be
a
millionnaire
he
chuckled
well
that
one
way
of
putting
it
hitch
your
wagon
to
a
star
but
begin
by
making
a
few
dollars
more
a
year
than
you
spend
when
i
began
he
stopped
short
with
an
amused
smile
remembering
that
i
did
not
know
who
he
was
of
course
i
said
i
understand
that
a
man
must
begin
small
he
was
on
pleasant
ground
and
anywhere
he
likes
a
few
dollars
here
a
few
there
he
must
work
hard
he
must
save
he
must
be
both
bold
and
cautious
i
know
a
man
who
began
when
he
was
about
your
age
with
total
assets
of
ten
dollars
and
a
good
digestion
he
now
considered
a
fairly
wealthy
man
he
has
a
home
in
the
city
a
place
in
the
country
and
he
goes
to
europe
when
he
likes
he
has
so
arranged
his
affairs
that
young
men
do
most
of
the
work
and
he
draws
the
dividends
and
all
in
a
little
more
than
twenty
years
i
made
every
single
cent
but
as
i
said
it
a
penny
business
to
start
with
the
point
is
i
like
to
see
young
men
ambitious
illustration
what
would
you
have
me
be
a
millionaire
ambitious
i
asked
for
what
why
to
rise
in
the
world
to
get
ahead
i
know
you
pardon
me
i
said
for
appearing
to
you
but
i
tremendously
interested
in
these
things
what
do
you
mean
by
rising
and
who
am
i
to
get
ahead
of
he
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
and
with
evident
impatience
at
my
consummate
stupidity
i
am
serious
i
said
i
really
want
to
make
the
best
i
can
of
my
life
it
the
only
one
i
got
see
here
he
said
let
us
say
you
clear
up
five
hundred
a
year
from
this
farm
you
exaggerate
i
interrupted
do
i
he
laughed
that
makes
my
case
all
the
better
now
is
it
possible
to
rise
from
that
could
you
make
a
thousand
or
five
thousand
or
even
fifty
thousand
a
year
it
seems
an
unanswerable
argument
fifty
thousand
dollars
i
suppose
i
might
i
said
but
do
you
think
i
be
any
better
off
or
happier
with
fifty
thousand
a
year
than
i
am
now
you
see
i
like
all
these
surroundings
better
than
any
other
place
i
ever
knew
that
old
green
hill
over
there
with
the
oak
on
it
is
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
i
have
a
good
cornfield
in
which
every
year
i
work
miracles
i
a
cow
and
a
horse
and
a
few
pigs
i
have
a
comfortable
home
my
appetite
is
perfect
and
i
have
plenty
of
food
to
gratify
it
i
sleep
every
night
like
a
boy
for
i
have
a
trouble
in
this
world
to
disturb
me
i
enjoy
the
mornings
here
in
the
country
and
the
evenings
are
pleasant
some
of
my
neighbours
have
come
to
be
my
good
friends
i
like
them
and
i
am
pretty
sure
they
like
me
inside
the
house
there
i
have
the
best
books
ever
written
and
i
have
time
in
the
evenings
to
read
them
i
mean
read
them
now
the
question
is
would
i
be
any
better
off
or
any
happier
if
i
had
fifty
thousand
a
year
john
starkweather
laughed
well
sir
he
said
i
see
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
philosopher
let
us
say
i
continued
that
you
are
willing
to
invest
twenty
years
of
your
life
in
a
million
dollars
merely
an
illustration
said
john
starkweather
you
have
it
where
you
can
put
it
in
the
bank
and
take
it
out
again
or
you
can
give
it
form
in
houses
yachts
and
other
things
now
twenty
years
of
my
life
to
me
is
worth
more
than
a
million
dollars
i
simply
ca
afford
to
sell
it
for
that
i
prefer
to
invest
it
as
somebody
or
other
has
said
unearned
in
life
i
always
had
a
liking
for
intangible
properties
see
here
said
john
starkweather
you
are
taking
a
narrow
view
of
life
you
are
making
your
own
pleasure
the
only
standard
should
a
man
make
the
most
of
the
talents
given
him
has
he
a
duty
to
society
now
you
are
shifting
your
ground
i
said
from
the
question
of
personal
satisfaction
to
that
of
duty
that
concerns
me
too
let
me
ask
you
is
it
important
to
society
that
this
piece
of
earth
be
plowed
and
cultivated
yes
but
is
it
honest
and
useful
work
of
course
is
it
important
that
it
shall
not
only
be
done
but
well
done
certainly
it
takes
all
there
is
in
a
good
man
i
said
to
be
a
good
farmer
but
the
point
is
he
argued
might
not
the
same
faculties
applied
to
other
things
yield
better
and
bigger
results
that
is
a
problem
of
course
i
said
i
tried
once
in
a
city
and
i
was
unsuccessful
and
unhappy
here
i
am
both
successful
and
happy
i
suppose
i
was
one
of
the
young
men
who
did
the
work
while
some
millionnaire
drew
the
dividends
i
was
cutting
close
and
i
venture
to
look
at
him
no
doubt
he
had
his
houses
and
yachts
and
went
to
europe
when
he
liked
i
know
i
lived
upstairs
back
where
there
was
a
tree
to
be
seen
or
a
spear
of
green
grass
or
a
hill
or
a
brook
only
smoke
and
chimneys
and
littered
roofs
lord
be
thanked
for
my
escape
sometimes
i
think
that
success
has
formed
a
silent
conspiracy
against
youth
success
holds
up
a
single
glittering
apple
and
bids
youth
strip
and
run
for
it
and
youth
runs
and
success
still
holds
the
apple
john
starkweather
said
nothing
yes
i
said
there
are
duties
we
realise
we
farmers
that
we
must
produce
more
than
we
ourselves
can
eat
or
wear
or
burn
we
realise
that
we
are
the
foundation
we
connect
human
life
with
the
earth
we
dig
and
plant
and
produce
and
having
eaten
at
the
first
table
ourselves
we
pass
what
is
left
to
the
bankers
and
millionnaires
did
you
ever
think
stranger
that
most
of
the
wars
of
the
world
have
been
fought
for
the
control
of
this
farmer
second
table
have
you
thought
that
the
surplus
of
wheat
and
corn
and
cotton
is
what
the
railroads
are
struggling
to
carry
upon
our
surplus
run
all
the
factories
and
mills
a
little
of
it
gathered
in
cash
makes
a
millionnaire
but
we
farmers
we
sit
back
comfortably
after
dinner
and
joke
with
our
wives
and
play
with
our
babies
and
let
all
the
rest
of
you
fight
for
the
crumbs
that
fall
from
our
abundant
tables
if
once
we
really
cared
and
got
up
and
shook
ourselves
and
said
to
the
maid
child
do
waste
the
crusts
gather
up
and
we
have
a
cottage
pudding
where
in
the
world
would
all
the
millionnaires
be
oh
i
tell
you
i
waxed
eloquent
i
could
let
john
starkweather
or
any
other
man
get
away
with
the
conviction
that
a
millionnaire
is
better
than
a
farmer
moreover
i
said
think
of
the
position
of
the
millionnaire
he
spends
his
time
playing
not
with
life
but
with
the
symbols
of
life
whether
cash
or
houses
any
day
the
symbols
may
change
a
little
war
may
happen
along
there
may
be
a
defective
flue
or
a
western
breeze
or
even
a
panic
because
the
farmers
are
scattering
as
many
crumbs
as
usual
they
call
it
crop
failure
but
i
noticed
that
the
farmers
still
continue
to
have
plenty
to
eat
and
then
what
happens
to
your
millionnaire
not
knowing
how
to
produce
anything
himself
he
would
starve
to
death
if
there
were
not
always
somewhere
a
farmer
to
take
him
up
to
the
table
you
making
a
strong
case
laughed
john
starkweather
strong
i
said
it
is
simply
wonderful
what
a
leverage
upon
society
a
few
acres
of
land
a
cow
a
pig
or
two
and
a
span
of
horses
gives
a
man
i
ridiculously
independent
i
be
the
hardest
sort
of
a
man
to
dislodge
or
crush
i
tell
you
my
friend
a
farmer
is
like
an
oak
his
roots
strike
deep
in
the
soil
he
draws
a
sufficiency
of
food
from
the
earth
itself
he
breathes
the
free
air
around
him
his
thirst
is
quenched
by
heaven
itself
and
there
no
tax
on
sunshine
i
paused
for
very
lack
of
breath
john
starkweather
was
laughing
when
you
commiserate
me
therefore
i
sure
i
shall
never
do
it
again
said
john
starkweather
when
you
commiserate
me
therefore
and
advise
me
to
rise
you
must
give
me
really
good
reasons
for
changing
my
occupation
and
becoming
a
millionnaire
you
must
prove
to
me
that
i
can
be
more
independent
more
honest
more
useful
as
a
millionnaire
and
that
i
shall
have
better
and
truer
friends
john
starkweather
looked
around
at
me
i
knew
i
had
been
absurdly
eager
and
i
was
rather
ashamed
of
myself
and
put
his
hand
on
my
knee
he
has
a
wonderfully
fine
eye
i
do
believe
he
said
you
have
any
truer
friends
anyway
i
said
repentantly
i
admit
that
millionnaires
have
their
place
at
present
i
would
do
entirely
away
with
them
though
i
do
think
they
enjoy
farming
better
and
if
i
were
to
select
a
millionnaire
for
all
the
best
things
i
know
i
should
certainly
choose
you
mr
starkweather
he
jumped
up
you
know
who
i
am
he
asked
i
nodded
and
you
knew
all
the
time
i
nodded
well
you
a
good
one
we
both
laughed
and
fell
to
talking
with
the
greatest
friendliness
i
led
him
down
my
garden
to
show
him
my
prize
of
which
i
am
enormously
proud
and
i
pulled
for
him
some
of
the
finest
stalks
i
could
find
take
it
home
i
said
it
makes
the
best
pies
of
any
in
this
country
he
took
it
under
his
arm
i
want
you
to
come
over
and
see
me
the
first
chance
you
get
he
said
i
going
to
prove
to
you
by
physical
demonstration
that
it
better
sport
to
be
a
millionnaire
than
a
farmer
not
that
i
am
a
millionnaire
i
only
accepting
the
reputation
you
give
me
so
i
walked
with
him
down
to
the
lane
let
me
know
when
you
grease
up
again
he
said
and
i
come
over
so
we
shook
hands
and
he
set
off
sturdily
down
the
road
with
the
leaves
waving
cheerfully
over
his
shoulder
illustration
somehow
and
suddenly
i
was
a
boy
again
viii
a
boy
and
a
preacher
this
morning
i
went
to
church
with
harriet
i
usually
have
some
excuse
for
not
going
but
this
morning
i
had
them
out
one
by
one
and
they
were
altogether
so
shabby
that
i
decided
not
to
use
them
so
i
put
on
my
stiff
shirt
and
harriet
came
out
in
her
best
black
cape
with
the
silk
fringes
she
looked
so
immaculate
so
ruddy
so
cheerfully
sober
for
sunday
that
i
was
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
driving
her
up
to
the
church
and
i
am
glad
i
went
for
the
experience
i
had
it
was
an
ideal
summer
sunday
sunshiny
clear
and
still
i
believe
if
i
had
been
some
rip
van
winkle
waking
after
twenty
years
sleep
i
should
have
known
it
for
sunday
away
off
over
the
hill
somewhere
we
could
hear
a
lazy
farm
boy
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
higher
cadences
of
his
song
reached
us
pleasantly
through
the
still
air
the
hens
sitting
near
the
lane
fence
fluffing
the
dust
over
their
backs
were
holding
a
small
and
talkative
service
of
their
own
as
we
turned
into
the
main
road
we
saw
the
patterson
children
on
their
way
to
church
all
the
little
girls
in
sunday
ribbons
and
all
the
little
boys
very
uncomfortable
in
knit
stockings
it
seems
a
pity
to
go
to
church
on
a
day
like
this
i
said
to
harriet
a
pity
she
exclaimed
could
anything
be
more
appropriate
harriet
is
good
because
she
ca
help
it
poor
woman
but
i
any
pity
for
her
it
sometimes
seems
to
me
the
more
worshipful
i
feel
the
less
i
want
to
go
to
church
i
do
know
why
it
is
but
these
forms
simple
though
they
are
trouble
me
the
moment
an
emotion
especially
a
religious
emotion
becomes
an
institution
it
somehow
loses
life
true
emotion
is
rare
and
costly
and
that
which
is
awakened
from
without
never
rises
to
the
height
of
that
which
springs
spontaneously
from
within
back
of
the
church
stands
a
long
low
shed
where
we
tied
our
horse
a
number
of
other
buggies
were
already
there
several
women
were
standing
in
groups
preening
their
feathers
a
neighbour
of
ours
who
has
a
tremendous
bass
voice
was
talking
to
a
friend
yas
oats
is
showing
up
well
but
wheat
is
backward
his
voice
which
he
was
evidently
trying
to
subdue
for
sunday
boomed
through
the
still
air
so
we
walked
among
the
trees
to
the
door
of
the
church
a
smiling
elder
in
an
unaccustomed
long
coat
bowed
and
greeted
us
as
we
went
in
there
was
an
odour
of
cushions
and
our
footsteps
on
the
wooden
floor
echoed
in
the
warm
emptiness
of
the
church
the
scotch
preacher
was
finding
his
place
in
the
big
bible
he
stood
solid
and
shaggy
behind
the
yellow
oak
pulpit
a
peculiar
professional
look
on
his
face
in
the
pulpit
the
scotch
preacher
is
too
much
minister
too
little
man
he
is
best
down
among
us
with
his
hand
in
ours
he
is
a
sort
of
human
solvent
is
there
a
twisted
and
hardened
heart
in
the
community
he
beams
upon
it
from
his
cheerful
eye
he
speaks
out
of
his
great
charity
he
gives
the
friendly
pressure
of
his
large
hand
and
that
hardened
heart
dissolves
and
its
frozen
hopelessness
loses
itself
in
tears
so
he
goes
through
life
seeming
always
to
understand
he
is
not
surprised
by
wickedness
nor
discouraged
by
weakness
he
is
so
sure
of
a
greater
strength
but
i
must
come
to
my
experience
which
i
am
almost
tempted
to
call
a
resurrection
the
resurrection
of
a
boy
long
since
gone
away
and
of
a
tall
lank
preacher
who
in
his
humility
looked
upon
himself
as
a
failure
i
hardly
know
how
it
all
came
back
to
me
possibly
it
was
the
breeze
that
came
in
from
the
woods
and
through
the
church
window
perhaps
it
was
a
line
in
one
of
the
old
songs
perhaps
it
was
the
droning
voice
of
the
scotch
preacher
somehow
and
suddenly
i
was
a
boy
again
to
this
day
i
think
of
death
as
a
valley
a
dark
shadowy
valley
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
so
persistent
are
the
impressions
of
boyhood
as
i
sat
in
the
church
i
could
see
as
distinctly
as
though
i
were
there
the
church
of
my
boyhood
and
the
tall
dyspeptic
preacher
looming
above
the
pulpit
the
peculiar
way
the
light
came
through
the
coarse
colour
of
the
windows
the
barrenness
and
stiffness
of
the
great
empty
room
the
raw
girders
overhead
the
prim
choir
there
was
something
in
that
preacher
gaunt
worn
sodden
though
he
appeared
a
spark
somewhere
a
little
flame
mostly
smothered
by
the
gray
dreariness
of
his
surroundings
and
yet
blazing
up
at
times
to
some
warmth
as
i
remember
it
our
church
was
a
church
of
failures
they
sent
us
the
old
gray
preachers
worn
out
in
other
fields
such
a
succession
of
them
i
remember
each
with
some
peculiarity
some
pathos
they
were
of
the
old
sort
indoctrinated
presbyterians
and
they
harrowed
well
our
barren
field
with
the
tooth
of
their
hard
creed
some
thundered
the
law
some
pleaded
love
but
of
all
of
them
i
remember
best
the
one
who
thought
himself
the
greatest
failure
i
think
he
had
tried
a
hundred
churches
a
hard
life
poorly
paid
unappreciated
in
a
new
country
he
had
once
had
a
family
but
one
by
one
they
had
died
no
two
were
buried
in
the
same
cemetery
and
finally
before
he
came
to
our
village
his
wife
too
had
gone
and
he
was
old
and
out
of
health
and
discouraged
seeking
some
final
warmth
from
his
own
cold
doctrine
how
i
see
him
a
trifle
bent
in
his
long
worn
coat
walking
in
the
country
roads
not
knowing
of
a
boy
who
loved
him
he
told
my
father
once
i
recall
his
exact
words
my
days
have
been
long
and
i
have
failed
it
was
not
given
me
to
reach
men
hearts
oh
gray
preacher
may
i
now
make
amends
will
you
forgive
me
i
was
a
boy
and
did
not
know
a
boy
whose
emotions
were
hidden
under
mountains
of
reserve
who
could
have
stood
up
to
be
shot
more
easily
than
he
could
have
said
i
love
you
of
that
preacher
sermons
i
remember
not
one
word
though
i
must
have
heard
scores
of
them
only
that
they
were
interminably
long
and
dull
and
that
my
legs
grew
weary
of
sitting
and
that
i
was
often
hungry
it
was
no
doubt
the
dreadful
old
doctrine
that
he
preached
thundering
the
horrors
of
disobedience
urging
an
impossible
love
through
fear
and
a
vain
belief
without
reason
all
that
touched
me
not
at
all
save
with
a
sort
of
wonder
at
the
working
of
his
great
adam
apple
and
the
strange
rollings
of
his
cavernous
eyes
this
he
looked
upon
as
the
work
of
god
thus
for
years
he
had
sought
with
failure
to
touch
the
souls
of
his
people
how
we
travel
in
darkness
and
the
work
we
do
in
all
seriousness
counts
for
naught
and
the
thing
we
toss
off
in
unconsciously
god
uses
one
boy
sitting
there
in
a
front
row
dreaming
dreams
if
the
sermons
touched
him
not
was
yet
thrilled
to
the
depths
of
his
being
by
that
tall
preacher
somewhere
i
said
he
had
a
spark
within
him
i
think
he
never
knew
it
or
if
he
knew
it
he
regarded
it
as
a
wayward
impulse
that
might
lead
him
from
his
god
it
was
a
spark
of
poetry
strange
flower
in
such
a
husk
in
times
of
emotion
it
bloomed
but
in
daily
life
it
emitted
no
fragrance
i
have
wondered
what
might
have
been
if
some
one
some
understanding
woman
had
recognised
his
gift
or
if
he
himself
as
a
boy
had
once
dared
to
cut
free
we
do
not
know
we
do
not
know
the
tragedy
of
our
nearest
friend
by
some
instinct
the
preacher
chose
his
readings
mostly
from
the
old
testament
those
splendid
marching
passages
full
of
oriental
imagery
as
he
read
there
would
creep
into
his
voice
a
certain
resonance
that
lifted
him
and
his
calling
suddenly
above
his
gray
surroundings
how
vividly
i
recall
his
reading
of
the
psalm
a
particular
reading
i
suppose
i
had
heard
the
passage
many
times
before
but
upon
this
certain
morning
shall
i
ever
forget
the
windows
were
open
for
it
was
may
and
a
boy
could
look
out
on
the
hillside
and
see
with
longing
eyes
the
inviting
grass
and
trees
a
soft
wind
blew
in
across
the
church
it
was
full
of
the
very
essence
of
spring
i
smell
it
yet
on
the
pulpit
stood
a
bunch
of
crocuses
crowded
into
a
vase
some
mary
offering
an
old
man
named
johnson
who
sat
near
us
was
already
beginning
to
breathe
heavily
preparatory
to
sinking
into
his
regular
sunday
snore
then
those
words
from
the
preacher
bringing
me
suddenly
how
shall
i
express
it
out
of
some
formless
void
to
intense
consciousness
a
miracle
of
creation
yea
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
evil
for
thou
art
with
me
thy
rod
and
thy
staff
they
comfort
me
well
i
saw
the
way
to
the
place
of
death
that
morning
far
more
vividly
i
saw
it
than
any
natural
scene
i
know
and
myself
walking
therein
i
shall
know
it
again
when
i
come
to
pass
that
way
the
tall
dark
rocky
cliffs
the
shadowy
path
within
the
overhanging
dark
branches
even
the
whitened
dead
bones
by
the
way
and
as
one
of
the
vivid
phantasms
of
boyhood
cloaked
figures
i
saw
lurking
mysteriously
in
deep
recesses
fearsome
for
their
very
silence
and
yet
i
with
magic
rod
and
staff
walking
within
boldly
fearing
no
evil
full
of
faith
hope
courage
love
invoking
images
of
terror
but
for
the
joy
of
braving
them
ah
boy
shall
i
tread
as
lightly
that
dread
pathway
when
i
come
to
it
shall
i
like
you
fear
no
evil
so
that
great
morning
went
away
i
heard
nothing
of
singing
or
sermon
and
came
not
to
myself
until
my
mother
touching
my
arm
asked
me
if
i
had
been
asleep
and
i
smiled
and
thought
how
little
grown
people
knew
and
i
looked
up
at
the
sad
sick
face
of
the
old
preacher
with
a
new
interest
and
friendliness
i
felt
somehow
that
he
too
was
a
familiar
of
my
secret
valley
i
should
have
liked
to
ask
him
but
i
did
not
dare
so
i
followed
my
mother
when
she
went
to
speak
to
him
and
when
he
did
not
see
i
touched
his
coat
after
that
how
i
watched
when
he
came
to
the
reading
and
one
great
sunday
he
chose
a
chapter
from
ecclesiastes
the
one
that
begins
sonorously
remember
now
thy
creator
in
the
days
of
thy
youth
surely
that
gaunt
preacher
had
the
true
fire
in
his
gray
soul
how
his
voice
dwelt
and
quivered
and
softened
upon
the
words
while
the
sun
or
the
light
or
the
moon
or
the
stars
be
not
darkened
nor
the
clouds
return
after
the
rain
thus
he
brought
in
the
universe
to
that
small
church
and
filled
the
heart
of
a
boy
in
the
days
when
the
keepers
of
the
house
shall
tremble
and
the
strong
men
shall
bow
themselves
and
the
grinders
cease
because
they
are
few
and
those
that
look
out
of
the
windows
be
darkened
and
the
doors
shall
be
shut
in
the
streets
when
the
sound
of
the
grinding
is
low
and
he
shall
rise
up
at
the
voice
of
the
bird
and
all
the
daughters
of
music
shall
be
brought
low
do
not
think
that
i
understood
the
meaning
of
those
passages
i
am
not
vain
enough
to
think
i
know
even
now
but
the
of
them
the
roll
of
them
the
beautiful
words
and
above
all
the
pictures
those
daughters
of
music
how
i
lived
for
days
imagining
them
they
were
of
the
trees
and
the
hills
and
they
were
very
beautiful
but
elusive
one
saw
them
as
he
heard
singing
afar
off
sweet
strains
fading
often
into
silences
daughters
of
music
daughters
of
music
and
why
should
they
be
brought
low
doors
shut
in
the
street
how
i
them
a
long
long
street
silent
full
of
sunshine
and
the
doors
shut
and
no
sound
anywhere
but
the
low
sound
of
the
grinding
and
the
mill
with
the
wheels
drowsily
turning
and
no
one
there
at
all
save
one
boy
with
fluttering
heart
tiptoeing
in
the
sunlit
doorway
and
the
voice
of
the
bird
not
the
song
but
the
yes
a
bird
had
a
voice
i
had
known
it
always
and
yet
somehow
i
had
not
dared
to
say
it
i
felt
that
they
would
look
at
me
with
that
questioning
incredulous
look
which
i
dreaded
beyond
belief
they
might
laugh
but
here
it
was
in
the
book
the
voice
of
a
bird
how
my
appreciation
of
that
book
increased
and
what
a
new
confidence
it
gave
me
in
my
own
images
i
went
about
for
days
listening
listening
listening
and
interpreting
so
the
words
of
the
preacher
and
the
fire
in
them
and
when
they
shall
be
afraid
of
that
which
is
high
and
fears
shall
be
in
the
way
i
knew
the
fear
of
that
which
is
high
i
had
dreamed
of
it
commonly
and
i
knew
also
the
fear
that
stood
in
the
way
him
i
had
seen
in
a
myriad
of
forms
looming
black
by
darkness
in
every
lane
i
trod
and
yet
with
what
defiance
i
met
and
slew
him
and
then
more
thrilling
than
all
else
the
words
of
the
preacher
or
ever
the
silver
cord
be
loosed
or
the
golden
bowl
be
broken
or
the
pitcher
be
broken
at
the
fountain
or
the
wheel
broken
at
the
cistern
such
pictures
that
silver
cord
that
golden
bowl
and
why
and
wherefore
a
thousand
ways
i
turned
them
in
my
mind
and
always
with
the
sound
of
the
preacher
voice
in
my
ears
the
resonance
of
the
words
conveying
an
indescribable
fire
of
inspiration
vaguely
and
yet
with
certainty
i
knew
the
preacher
spoke
out
of
some
unfathomable
emotion
which
i
did
not
understand
which
i
did
not
care
to
understand
since
then
i
have
thought
what
those
words
must
have
meant
to
him
ah
that
tall
lank
preacher
who
thought
himself
a
failure
how
long
i
shall
remember
him
and
the
words
he
read
and
the
mournful
yet
resonant
cadences
of
his
voice
and
the
barren
church
and
the
stony
religion
heaven
he
gave
me
unknowing
while
he
preached
an
ineffectual
hell
as
we
rode
home
harriet
looked
into
my
face
you
have
enjoyed
the
service
she
said
softly
yes
i
said
it
a
good
sermon
she
said
was
it
i
replied
ix
the
tramp
i
have
had
a
new
and
strange
experience
droll
in
one
way
grotesque
in
another
and
when
everything
is
said
tragic
at
least
an
adventure
harriet
looks
at
me
accusingly
and
i
have
had
to
preserve
the
air
of
one
deeply
contrite
now
for
two
days
no
easy
accomplishment
for
me
even
though
in
secret
i
have
smiled
and
pondered
how
our
life
has
been
warped
by
books
we
are
not
contented
with
realities
we
crave
conclusions
with
what
ardour
our
minds
respond
to
real
events
with
literary
deductions
upon
a
train
of
incidents
as
unconnected
as
life
itself
we
are
wont
to
clap
a
booky
ending
an
instinctive
desire
for
completeness
animates
the
human
mind
a
struggle
to
circumscribe
the
infinite
we
would
like
to
have
life
turn
out
but
it
does
it
does
each
event
is
the
beginning
of
a
whole
new
genealogy
of
events
in
boyhood
i
remember
asking
after
every
story
i
heard
what
happened
next
for
no
conclusion
ever
quite
satisfied
me
even
when
the
hero
died
in
his
own
gore
i
always
knew
there
was
something
yet
remaining
to
be
told
the
only
sure
conclusion
we
can
reach
is
this
life
changes
and
what
is
more
enthralling
to
the
human
mind
than
this
splendid
boundless
coloured
mutability
life
in
the
making
how
strange
it
is
then
that
we
should
be
contented
to
take
such
small
parts
of
it
as
we
can
grasp
and
to
say
this
is
the
true
explanation
by
such
devices
we
seek
to
bring
infinite
existence
within
our
finite
egoistic
grasp
we
solidify
and
define
where
solidification
means
loss
of
interest
and
loss
of
interest
not
years
is
old
age
so
i
have
mused
since
my
tramp
came
in
for
a
moment
out
of
the
mystery
as
we
all
do
and
went
away
again
into
the
mystery
in
our
way
too
there
are
strange
things
in
this
world
as
i
came
around
the
corner
i
saw
sitting
there
on
my
steps
the
very
personification
of
ruin
a
dilapidated
wreck
of
manhood
he
gave
one
the
impression
of
having
been
dropped
where
he
sat
all
in
a
heap
my
first
instinctive
feeling
was
not
one
of
recoil
or
even
of
hostility
but
rather
a
sudden
desire
to
pick
him
up
and
put
him
where
he
belonged
the
instinct
i
should
say
of
the
normal
man
who
hangs
his
axe
always
on
the
same
nail
when
he
saw
me
he
gathered
himself
together
with
reluctance
and
stood
fully
revealed
it
was
a
curious
attitude
of
mingled
effrontery
and
apology
hit
me
if
you
dare
blustered
his
outward
personality
for
god
sake
do
hit
me
cried
the
innate
fear
in
his
eyes
i
stopped
and
looked
at
him
sharply
his
eyes
dropped
his
look
slid
away
so
that
i
experienced
a
sense
of
shame
as
though
i
had
trampled
upon
him
a
damp
rag
of
humanity
i
confess
that
my
first
impulse
and
a
strong
one
was
to
kick
him
for
the
good
of
the
human
race
no
man
has
a
right
to
be
like
that
and
then
quite
suddenly
i
had
a
great
revulsion
of
feeling
what
was
i
that
i
should
judge
without
knowledge
perhaps
after
all
here
was
one
bearing
treasure
so
i
said
you
are
the
man
i
have
been
expecting
he
did
not
reply
only
flashed
his
eyes
up
at
me
wherein
fear
deepened
i
have
been
saving
up
a
coat
for
you
i
said
and
a
pair
of
shoes
they
are
not
much
worn
i
said
but
a
little
too
small
for
me
i
think
they
will
fit
you
he
looked
at
me
again
not
sharply
but
with
a
sort
of
weak
cunning
so
far
he
had
not
said
a
word
i
think
our
supper
is
nearly
ready
i
said
let
us
go
in
no
mister
he
mumbled
a
bite
out
here
no
mister
and
then
as
though
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
inspired
him
he
grew
declamatory
i
a
respectable
man
mister
plumber
by
trade
but
but
i
interrupted
you
ca
get
any
work
you
cold
and
you
have
had
anything
to
eat
for
two
days
so
you
are
walking
out
here
in
the
country
where
we
farmers
have
no
plumbing
to
do
at
home
you
have
a
starving
wife
and
three
small
children
six
mister
well
six
and
now
we
will
go
in
to
supper
i
led
him
into
the
entry
way
and
poured
for
him
a
big
basin
of
hot
water
as
i
stepped
out
again
with
a
comb
he
was
slinking
toward
the
doorway
here
i
said
is
a
comb
we
are
having
supper
now
in
a
few
minutes
i
wish
i
could
picture
harriet
face
when
i
brought
him
into
her
immaculate
kitchen
but
i
gave
her
a
look
one
of
the
commanding
sort
that
i
can
put
on
in
times
of
great
emergency
and
she
silently
laid
another
place
at
the
table
when
i
came
to
look
at
our
ruin
by
the
full
lamplight
i
was
surprised
to
see
what
a
change
a
little
warm
water
and
a
comb
had
wrought
in
him
he
came
to
the
table
uncertain
blinking
apologetic
his
forehead
i
saw
was
really
impressive
high
narrow
and
his
face
gave
one
somehow
the
impression
of
a
carving
once
full
of
significant
lines
now
blurred
and
worn
as
though
time
having
first
marked
it
with
the
lines
of
character
had
grown
discouraged
and
brushed
the
hand
of
forgetfulness
over
her
work
he
had
peculiar
thin
silky
hair
of
no
particular
colour
with
a
certain
almost
childish
pathetic
waviness
around
the
ears
and
at
the
back
of
the
neck
something
after
all
about
the
man
aroused
one
compassion
i
do
know
that
he
looked
dissipated
and
surely
he
was
not
as
dirty
as
i
had
at
first
supposed
something
remained
that
suggested
a
care
for
himself
in
the
past
it
was
not
dissipation
i
decided
it
was
rather
an
indefinable
looseness
and
weakness
that
gave
one
alternately
the
feeling
i
had
first
experienced
that
of
anger
succeeded
by
the
compassion
that
one
feels
for
a
child
to
harriet
when
she
had
once
seen
him
he
was
all
child
and
she
all
compassion
we
disturbed
him
with
no
questions
harriet
fundamental
quality
is
homeliness
comfortableness
her
seems
always
singing
an
indefinable
tabbiness
as
of
feather
cushions
lurks
in
her
a
right
warmth
of
table
and
chairs
indescribably
comfortable
at
the
end
of
a
chilly
day
a
busy
steam
arises
from
all
her
dishes
at
once
and
the
light
in
the
middle
of
the
table
is
of
a
redness
that
enthralls
the
human
soul
as
for
harriet
herself
she
is
the
personification
of
comfort
airy
clean
warm
inexpressibly
wholesome
and
never
in
the
world
is
she
so
engaging
as
when
she
ministers
to
a
man
hunger
truthfully
sometimes
when
she
comes
to
me
out
of
the
dimmer
light
of
the
kitchen
to
the
radiance
of
the
table
with
a
plate
of
muffins
it
is
as
though
she
and
the
muffins
were
a
part
of
each
other
and
that
she
is
really
offering
some
of
herself
and
down
in
my
heart
i
know
she
is
doing
just
that
well
it
was
wonderful
to
see
our
ruin
expand
in
the
warmth
of
presence
he
had
been
doubtful
of
me
of
harriet
i
could
see
he
was
absolutely
sure
and
how
he
did
eat
saying
nothing
at
all
while
harriet
plied
him
with
food
and
talked
to
me
of
the
most
disarming
commonplaces
i
think
it
did
her
heart
good
to
see
the
way
he
ate
as
though
he
had
had
nothing
before
in
days
as
he
buttered
his
muffin
not
without
some
refinement
i
could
see
that
his
hand
was
long
a
curious
lean
ineffectual
hand
with
a
curving
little
finger
with
the
drinking
of
the
hot
coffee
colour
began
to
steal
up
into
his
face
and
when
harriet
brought
out
a
quarter
of
pie
saved
over
from
our
dinner
and
placed
it
before
him
a
fine
brown
pie
with
small
hieroglyphics
in
the
top
from
whence
rose
sugary
bubbles
he
seemed
almost
to
escape
himself
and
harriet
fairly
purred
with
hospitality
the
more
he
ate
the
more
of
a
man
he
became
his
manners
improved
his
back
straightened
up
he
acquired
a
not
unimpressive
poise
of
the
head
such
is
the
miraculous
power
of
hot
muffins
and
pie
as
you
came
down
i
asked
finally
did
you
happen
to
see
old
man
masterson
threshing
machine
a
big
red
one
with
a
yellow
that
the
one
i
said
well
it
was
just
turning
into
a
field
about
two
miles
above
here
he
replied
big
gray
banked
barn
i
asked
yes
and
a
little
unpainted
house
said
our
friend
that
parsons
put
in
harriet
with
a
mellow
laugh
i
wonder
if
he
ever
paint
that
house
he
builds
bigger
barns
every
year
and
does
touch
the
house
poor
parsons
and
so
we
talked
of
barns
and
threshing
machines
in
the
way
we
farmers
love
to
do
and
i
lured
our
friend
slowly
into
talking
about
himself
at
first
he
was
enough
and
what
he
said
seemed
curiously
made
to
order
he
used
certain
set
phrases
with
which
to
explain
simply
what
was
not
easy
to
explain
a
device
not
uncommon
to
all
of
us
i
was
fearful
of
not
getting
within
this
outward
armouring
but
gradually
as
we
talked
and
harriet
poured
him
a
third
cup
of
hot
coffee
he
dropped
into
a
more
familiar
tone
he
told
with
some
sprightliness
of
having
seen
threshings
in
mexico
how
the
grain
was
beaten
out
with
flails
in
the
patios
and
afterwards
thrown
up
in
the
wind
to
winnow
out
you
must
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
life
remarked
harriet
sympathetically
at
this
remark
i
saw
one
of
our
ruin
long
hands
draw
up
and
clinch
he
turned
his
head
toward
harriet
his
face
was
partly
in
the
shadow
but
there
was
something
striking
and
strange
in
the
way
he
looked
at
her
and
a
deepness
in
his
voice
when
he
spoke
too
much
i
seen
too
much
of
life
he
threw
out
one
arm
and
brought
it
back
with
a
shudder
you
see
what
it
has
left
me
he
said
i
am
an
example
of
too
much
life
in
response
to
harriet
melting
compassion
he
had
spoken
with
unfathomable
bitterness
suddenly
he
leaned
forward
toward
me
with
a
piercing
gaze
as
though
he
would
look
into
my
soul
his
face
had
changed
completely
from
the
loose
and
vacant
mask
of
the
early
evening
it
had
taken
on
the
utmost
tensity
of
emotion
you
do
not
know
he
said
what
it
is
to
live
too
much
and
to
be
afraid
live
too
much
i
asked
yes
live
too
much
that
is
what
i
do
and
i
am
afraid
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
broke
out
in
a
higher
key
you
think
i
am
a
tramp
yes
you
do
i
know
a
worthless
fellow
lying
begging
stealing
when
he
ca
beg
you
have
taken
me
in
and
fed
me
you
have
said
the
first
kind
words
i
have
heard
it
seems
to
me
in
years
i
do
know
who
you
are
i
shall
never
see
you
again
i
can
not
well
describe
the
intensity
of
the
passion
with
which
he
spoke
his
face
shaking
with
emotion
his
hands
trembling
oh
yes
i
said
easily
we
are
comfortable
people
here
and
it
is
a
good
place
to
live
no
no
he
returned
i
know
i
got
my
call
then
leaning
forward
he
said
in
a
lower
even
more
intense
voice
i
live
everything
beforehand
i
was
startled
by
the
look
of
his
eyes
the
abject
terror
of
it
and
i
thought
to
myself
the
man
is
not
right
in
his
mind
and
yet
i
longed
to
know
of
the
life
within
this
strange
husk
of
manhood
i
know
he
said
as
if
reading
my
thought
you
think
and
he
tapped
his
forehead
with
one
finger
but
i
not
i
as
sane
as
you
are
it
was
a
strange
story
he
told
it
seems
almost
unbelievable
to
me
as
i
set
it
down
here
until
i
reflect
how
little
any
one
of
us
knows
of
the
deep
life
within
his
nearest
neighbour
what
stories
there
are
what
tragedies
enacted
under
a
calm
exterior
what
a
drama
there
be
in
this
commonplace
man
buying
ten
pounds
of
sugar
at
the
grocery
store
or
this
other
one
driving
his
two
old
horses
in
the
town
road
we
do
not
know
and
how
rarely
are
the
men
of
inner
adventure
articulate
therefore
i
treasure
the
curious
story
the
tramp
told
me
i
do
not
question
its
truth
it
came
as
all
truth
does
through
a
clouded
and
unclean
medium
and
any
judgment
of
the
story
itself
must
be
based
upon
a
knowledge
of
the
personal
equation
of
the
ruin
who
told
it
i
am
no
tramp
he
said
in
reality
i
am
no
tramp
i
began
as
well
as
anyone
it
does
matter
now
only
i
wo
have
any
of
the
sympathy
that
people
give
to
the
man
who
has
seen
better
days
i
hate
sentiment
hate
i
can
not
attempt
to
set
down
the
story
in
his
own
words
it
was
broken
with
exclamations
and
involved
with
wandering
sophistries
and
diatribes
of
his
mind
had
trampled
upon
itself
in
throes
of
introspection
until
it
was
often
difficult
to
say
which
way
the
paths
of
the
narrative
really
led
he
had
thought
so
much
and
acted
so
little
that
he
travelled
in
a
veritable
bog
of
indecision
and
yet
withal
some
ideas
by
constant
attrition
had
acquired
a
really
striking
form
i
am
afraid
before
life
he
said
it
makes
me
dizzy
with
thought
at
another
time
he
said
if
i
am
a
tramp
at
all
i
am
a
mental
tramp
i
have
an
unanchored
mind
it
seems
that
he
came
to
a
realisation
that
there
was
something
peculiar
about
him
at
a
very
early
age
he
said
they
would
look
at
him
and
whisper
to
one
another
and
that
his
sayings
were
much
repeated
often
in
his
hearing
he
knew
that
he
was
considered
an
extraordinary
child
they
baited
him
with
questions
that
they
might
laugh
at
his
quaint
replies
he
said
that
as
early
as
he
could
remember
he
used
to
plan
situations
so
that
he
might
say
things
that
were
strange
and
even
shocking
in
a
child
his
father
was
a
small
professor
in
a
small
college
a
worm
he
called
him
bitterly
one
of
those
worms
that
bores
in
books
and
finally
dries
up
and
blows
off
but
his
mother
he
said
she
was
an
angel
i
recall
his
exact
expression
about
her
eyes
that
when
she
looked
at
one
it
made
him
better
he
spoke
of
her
with
a
softening
of
the
voice
looking
often
at
harriet
he
talked
a
good
deal
about
his
mother
trying
to
account
for
himself
through
her
she
was
not
strong
he
said
and
very
sensitive
to
the
contact
of
either
friends
or
enemies
evidently
a
nervous
woman
you
have
known
such
people
he
said
everything
hurt
her
he
said
she
starved
to
death
she
starved
for
affection
and
understanding
one
of
the
first
things
he
recalled
of
his
boyhood
was
his
passionate
love
for
his
mother
i
can
remember
he
said
lying
awake
in
my
bed
and
thinking
how
i
would
love
her
and
serve
her
and
i
could
see
myself
in
all
sorts
of
impossible
places
saving
her
from
danger
when
she
came
to
my
room
to
bid
me
good
night
i
imagined
how
i
should
look
for
i
have
always
been
able
to
see
myself
doing
things
when
i
threw
my
arms
around
her
neck
to
kiss
her
here
he
reached
a
strange
part
of
his
story
i
had
been
watching
harriet
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
at
first
her
face
was
tearful
with
compassion
but
as
the
ruin
proceeded
it
became
a
study
in
wonder
and
finally
in
outright
alarm
he
said
that
when
his
mother
came
in
to
bid
him
good
night
he
saw
himself
so
plainly
beforehand
more
vividly
than
i
see
you
at
this
moment
and
felt
his
emotion
so
keenly
that
when
his
mother
actually
stooped
to
kiss
him
somehow
he
could
not
respond
he
could
not
throw
his
arms
around
her
neck
he
said
he
often
lay
quiet
in
waiting
trembling
all
over
until
she
had
gone
not
only
suffering
himself
but
pitying
her
because
he
understood
how
she
must
feel
then
he
would
follow
her
he
said
in
imagination
through
the
long
hall
seeing
himself
stealing
behind
her
just
touching
her
hand
wistfully
hoping
that
she
might
turn
to
him
again
and
yet
fearing
he
said
no
one
knew
the
agonies
he
suffered
at
seeing
his
mother
disappointment
over
his
apparent
coldness
and
unresponsiveness
i
think
he
said
it
hastened
her
death
he
would
not
go
to
the
funeral
he
did
not
dare
he
said
he
cried
and
fought
when
they
came
to
take
him
away
and
when
the
house
was
silent
he
ran
up
to
her
room
and
buried
his
head
in
her
pillows
and
ran
in
swift
imagination
to
her
funeral
he
said
he
could
see
himself
in
the
country
road
hurrying
in
the
cold
rain
for
it
seemed
raining
he
said
he
could
actually
feel
the
stones
and
ruts
although
he
could
not
tell
how
it
was
possible
that
he
should
have
seen
himself
at
a
distance
and
in
his
own
feet
the
stones
of
the
road
he
said
he
saw
the
box
taken
from
the
wagon
it
and
that
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
clods
thrown
in
and
it
made
him
shriek
until
they
came
running
and
held
him
as
he
grew
older
he
said
he
came
to
live
everything
beforehand
and
that
the
event
as
imagined
was
so
far
more
vivid
and
affecting
that
he
had
no
heart
for
the
reality
itself
it
seems
strange
to
you
he
said
but
i
am
telling
you
exactly
what
my
experience
was
it
was
curious
he
said
when
his
father
told
him
he
must
not
do
a
thing
how
he
went
on
and
imagined
in
how
many
different
ways
he
could
do
it
and
how
afterward
he
imagined
he
was
punished
by
that
worm
his
father
whom
he
seemed
to
hate
bitterly
of
those
early
days
in
which
he
suffered
acutely
in
idleness
apparently
and
perhaps
that
was
one
of
the
causes
of
his
disorder
he
told
us
at
length
but
many
of
the
incidents
were
so
evidently
worn
by
the
constant
handling
of
his
mind
that
they
gave
no
clear
impression
finally
he
ran
away
from
home
he
said
at
first
he
found
that
a
wholly
new
place
and
new
people
took
him
out
of
himself
surprised
me
he
said
so
that
i
could
not
live
everything
beforehand
thus
he
fled
the
slang
he
used
chased
himself
all
over
the
country
seemed
peculiarly
expressive
he
had
been
in
foreign
countries
he
had
herded
sheep
in
australia
so
he
said
and
certainly
from
his
knowledge
of
the
country
he
had
wandered
with
the
gamboleros
of
south
america
he
had
gone
for
gold
to
alaska
and
worked
in
the
lumber
camps
of
the
pacific
northwest
but
he
could
not
escape
he
said
in
a
short
time
he
was
no
longer
surprised
his
account
of
his
travels
while
fragmentary
had
a
peculiar
vividness
he
what
he
described
and
he
saw
it
so
plainly
that
his
mind
ran
off
into
curious
details
that
made
his
words
strike
sometimes
like
flashes
of
lightning
a
strange
and
wonderful
mind
uncontrolled
how
that
man
needed
the
discipline
of
common
work
i
have
rarely
listened
to
a
story
with
such
rapt
interest
it
was
not
only
what
he
said
nor
how
he
said
it
but
how
he
let
me
see
the
strange
workings
of
his
mind
it
was
continuously
a
story
of
a
story
when
his
voice
finally
died
down
i
drew
a
long
breath
and
was
astonished
to
perceive
that
it
was
nearly
midnight
and
harriet
speechless
with
her
emotions
for
a
moment
he
sat
quiet
and
then
burst
out
i
can
not
get
away
i
can
not
escape
and
the
veritable
look
of
some
trapped
creature
came
into
his
eyes
fear
so
abject
that
i
reached
over
and
laid
my
hand
on
his
arm
friend
i
said
stop
here
we
have
a
good
country
you
have
travelled
far
enough
i
know
from
experience
what
a
cornfield
will
do
for
a
man
i
have
lived
all
sorts
of
life
he
continued
as
if
he
had
not
heard
a
word
i
said
and
i
have
lived
it
all
twice
and
i
am
afraid
face
it
i
said
gripping
his
arm
longing
for
some
power
to
blow
grit
into
him
face
it
he
exclaimed
do
you
suppose
i
have
tried
if
i
could
do
a
thing
anything
a
few
times
without
thinking
would
be
enough
i
might
be
all
right
i
should
be
all
right
he
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
and
there
was
a
note
of
resolution
in
his
voice
i
moved
my
chair
nearer
to
him
feeling
as
though
i
were
saving
an
immortal
soul
from
destruction
i
told
him
of
our
life
how
the
quiet
and
the
work
of
it
would
solve
his
problems
i
sketched
with
enthusiasm
my
own
experience
and
i
planned
swiftly
how
he
could
live
absorbed
in
simple
work
and
in
books
try
it
i
said
eagerly
i
will
he
said
rising
from
the
table
and
grasping
my
hand
stay
here
i
had
a
peculiar
thrill
of
exultation
and
triumph
i
know
how
the
priest
must
feel
having
won
a
soul
from
torment
he
was
trembling
with
excitement
and
pale
with
emotion
and
weariness
one
must
begin
the
quiet
life
with
rest
so
i
got
him
off
to
bed
first
pouring
him
a
bathtub
of
warm
water
i
laid
out
clean
clothes
by
his
bedside
and
took
away
his
old
ones
talking
to
him
cheerfully
all
the
time
about
common
things
when
i
finally
left
him
and
came
downstairs
i
found
harriet
standing
with
frightened
eyes
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
i
afraid
to
have
him
sleep
in
this
house
she
said
but
i
reassured
her
you
do
not
understand
i
said
owing
to
the
excitement
of
the
evening
i
spent
a
restless
night
before
daylight
while
i
was
dreaming
a
strange
dream
of
two
men
running
the
one
who
pursued
being
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
one
who
fled
i
heard
my
name
called
aloud
david
david
i
sprang
out
of
bed
the
tramp
has
gone
called
harriet
he
had
not
even
slept
in
his
bed
he
had
raised
the
window
dropped
out
on
the
ground
and
vanished
x
the
infidel
i
find
that
we
have
an
infidel
in
this
community
i
do
know
that
i
should
set
down
the
fact
here
on
good
white
paper
the
walls
they
say
have
eyes
the
stones
have
ears
but
consider
these
words
written
in
bated
breath
the
worst
of
it
is
i
gather
from
common
report
this
infidel
is
a
cheerful
infidel
whereas
a
true
infidel
should
bear
upon
his
face
the
living
mark
of
his
infamy
we
are
all
tolerant
enough
of
those
who
do
not
agree
with
us
provided
only
they
are
sufficiently
miserable
i
confess
when
i
first
heard
of
him
through
horace
with
shudders
i
was
possessed
of
a
consuming
secret
desire
to
see
him
i
even
thought
of
climbing
a
tree
somewhere
along
the
public
road
like
zaccheus
was
it
and
watching
him
go
by
if
by
any
chance
he
should
look
my
way
i
could
easily
avoid
discovery
by
crouching
among
the
leaves
it
shows
how
pleasant
must
be
the
paths
of
unrighteousness
that
we
are
tempted
to
climb
trees
to
see
those
who
walk
therein
my
imagination
busied
itself
with
the
infidel
i
pictured
him
as
a
sort
of
moloch
treading
our
pleasant
countryside
flames
and
smoke
proceeding
from
his
nostrils
his
feet
striking
fire
his
voice
like
the
sound
of
a
great
wind
at
least
that
was
the
picture
i
formed
of
him
from
common
report
and
yesterday
afternoon
i
met
the
infidel
and
i
must
here
set
down
a
true
account
of
the
adventure
it
is
surely
a
little
new
door
opened
in
the
house
of
my
understanding
i
might
travel
a
whole
year
in
a
city
brushing
men
elbows
and
not
once
have
such
an
experience
in
country
spaces
men
develop
sensitive
surfaces
not
calloused
by
too
frequent
contact
accepting
the
new
impression
vividly
and
keeping
it
bright
to
think
upon
i
met
the
infidel
as
the
result
of
a
rather
unexpected
series
of
incidents
i
do
think
i
have
said
before
that
we
have
for
some
time
been
expecting
a
great
event
on
this
farm
we
have
raised
corn
and
buckwheat
we
have
a
fertile
asparagus
bed
and
onions
and
enough
to
supply
the
entire
population
of
this
community
and
i
tell
how
many
other
vegetables
we
have
had
plenty
of
chickens
hatched
out
i
do
like
chickens
especially
hens
especially
a
certain
gaunt
and
predatory
hen
named
so
harriet
says
evangeline
who
belongs
to
a
neighbour
of
ours
and
we
have
had
two
litters
of
pigs
but
until
this
bright
moment
of
expectancy
we
never
have
had
a
calf
upon
the
advice
of
horace
which
i
often
lean
upon
as
upon
a
staff
i
have
been
keeping
my
young
heifer
shut
up
in
the
now
for
a
week
or
two
but
yesterday
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
i
found
the
fence
broken
down
and
the
empty
from
what
harriet
said
the
brown
cow
must
have
been
gone
since
early
morning
i
knew
of
course
what
that
meant
and
straightway
i
took
a
stout
stick
and
set
off
over
the
hill
tracing
the
brown
cow
as
far
as
i
could
by
her
tracks
she
had
made
way
toward
a
clump
of
trees
near
horace
wood
lot
where
i
confidently
expected
to
find
her
but
as
fate
would
have
it
the
pasture
gate
which
is
rarely
used
stood
open
and
the
tracks
led
outward
into
an
old
road
i
followed
rapidly
half
pleased
that
i
had
not
found
her
within
the
wood
it
was
a
promise
of
new
adventure
which
i
came
to
with
downright
enjoyment
confidentially
i
should
have
been
cultivating
corn
i
peered
into
every
thicket
as
i
passed
once
i
climbed
an
old
fence
and
standing
on
the
top
rail
intently
surveyed
my
pasture
no
brown
cow
was
to
be
seen
at
the
crossing
of
the
brook
i
shouldered
my
way
from
the
road
down
a
path
among
the
alders
thinking
the
brown
cow
might
have
gone
that
way
to
obscurity
it
is
curious
how
in
spite
of
domestication
and
training
nature
in
her
great
moments
returns
to
the
primitive
and
instinctive
my
brown
cow
never
having
had
anything
but
the
kindest
treatment
is
as
gentle
an
animal
as
could
be
imagined
but
she
had
followed
the
nameless
law
of
her
breed
she
had
escaped
in
her
great
moment
to
the
most
secret
place
she
knew
it
did
not
matter
that
she
would
have
been
safer
in
my
yard
both
she
and
her
calf
that
she
would
have
been
surer
of
her
food
she
could
only
obey
the
old
wild
law
so
turkeys
will
hide
their
nests
so
the
tame
duck
tame
for
unnumbered
generations
hearing
from
afar
the
shrill
cry
of
the
wild
drake
will
desert
her
quiet
surroundings
spread
her
wings
and
become
for
a
time
the
wildest
of
the
wild
so
we
think
you
and
i
that
we
are
civilised
but
how
often
how
often
have
we
felt
that
old
wildness
which
is
our
common
heritage
scarce
shackled
clamouring
in
our
blood
i
stood
listening
among
the
alders
in
the
deep
cool
shade
here
and
there
a
ray
of
sunshine
came
through
the
thick
foliage
i
could
see
it
where
it
silvered
the
cobweb
ladders
of
those
moist
spaces
somewhere
in
the
thicket
i
heard
an
unalarmed
catbird
trilling
her
exquisite
song
a
startled
frog
leaped
with
a
splash
into
the
water
faint
odours
of
some
blossoming
growth
not
distinguishable
filled
the
still
air
it
was
one
of
those
rare
moments
when
one
seems
to
have
caught
nature
unaware
i
lingered
a
full
minute
listening
looking
but
my
brown
cow
had
not
gone
that
way
so
i
turned
and
went
up
rapidly
to
the
road
and
there
i
found
myself
almost
face
to
face
with
a
ruddy
little
man
whose
countenance
bore
a
look
of
round
astonishment
we
were
both
surprised
i
recovered
first
have
you
seen
a
brown
cow
i
asked
he
was
still
so
astonished
that
he
began
to
look
around
him
he
thrust
his
hands
nervously
into
his
coat
pockets
and
pulled
them
out
again
i
think
you
wo
find
her
in
there
i
said
seeking
to
relieve
his
embarrassment
but
i
did
know
then
how
very
serious
a
person
i
had
encountered
no
no
he
stammered
i
have
seen
your
cow
so
i
explained
to
him
with
sobriety
and
at
some
length
the
problem
i
had
to
solve
he
was
greatly
interested
and
inasmuch
as
he
was
going
my
way
he
offered
at
once
to
assist
me
in
my
search
so
we
set
off
together
he
was
rather
stocky
of
build
and
decidedly
short
of
breath
so
that
i
regulated
my
customary
stride
to
suit
his
deliberation
at
first
being
filled
with
the
spirit
of
my
adventure
i
was
not
altogether
pleased
with
this
arrangement
our
conversation
ran
something
like
this
stranger
has
she
any
spots
or
marks
on
her
myself
no
she
is
plain
brown
stranger
how
old
a
cow
is
she
myself
this
is
her
first
calf
stranger
valuable
animal
myself
fencing
i
have
never
put
a
price
on
her
she
is
a
promising
young
heifer
stranger
pure
blood
myself
no
grade
after
a
pause
stranger
live
around
here
myself
yes
half
a
mile
below
here
do
you
stranger
yes
three
miles
above
here
my
name
purdy
myself
mine
is
grayson
he
turned
to
me
solemnly
and
held
out
his
hand
glad
to
meet
you
grayson
he
said
and
i
glad
i
said
to
meet
you
mr
purdy
i
will
not
attempt
to
put
down
all
we
said
i
could
but
by
such
devices
is
the
truth
in
the
country
made
manifest
so
we
continued
to
walk
and
look
occasionally
i
would
unconsciously
increase
my
pace
until
i
was
warned
to
desist
by
the
puffing
of
purdy
he
gave
an
essential
impression
of
genial
timidity
and
how
he
love
to
talk
we
came
at
last
to
a
rough
bit
of
land
grown
up
to
scrubby
oaks
and
hazel
brush
this
said
purdy
looks
hopeful
we
followed
the
old
road
examining
every
bare
spot
of
earth
for
some
evidence
of
the
cow
tracks
but
without
finding
so
much
as
a
sign
i
was
for
pushing
onward
but
purdy
insisted
that
this
clump
of
woods
was
exactly
such
a
place
as
a
cow
would
like
he
developed
such
a
capacity
for
argumentation
and
seemed
so
sure
of
what
he
was
talking
about
that
i
yielded
and
we
entered
the
wood
we
part
here
he
said
you
keep
over
there
about
fifty
yards
and
i
go
straight
ahead
in
that
way
we
cover
the
ground
keep
so
we
started
and
i
kept
he
would
answer
from
time
to
time
hulloo
hulloo
it
was
a
wild
and
beautiful
bit
of
forest
the
ground
under
the
trees
was
thickly
covered
with
enormous
ferns
or
bracken
with
here
and
there
patches
of
light
where
the
sun
came
through
the
foliage
the
low
spots
were
filled
with
the
coarse
green
verdure
of
skunk
cabbage
i
was
so
sceptical
about
finding
the
cow
in
a
wood
where
concealment
was
so
easy
that
i
confess
i
rather
idled
and
enjoyed
the
surroundings
suddenly
however
i
heard
purdy
voice
with
a
new
note
in
it
hulloo
hulloo
what
luck
hulloo
hulloo
i
coming
and
i
turned
and
ran
as
rapidly
as
i
could
through
the
trees
jumping
over
logs
and
dodging
low
branches
wondering
what
new
thing
my
friend
had
discovered
so
i
came
to
his
side
have
you
got
trace
of
her
i
questioned
eagerly
sh
he
said
over
there
do
you
see
her
where
where
he
pointed
but
for
a
moment
i
could
see
nothing
but
the
trees
and
the
bracken
then
all
at
once
like
the
puzzle
in
a
picture
i
saw
her
plainly
she
was
standing
perfectly
motionless
her
head
lowered
and
in
such
a
peculiar
clump
of
bushes
and
ferns
that
she
was
all
but
indistinguishable
it
was
wonderful
the
perfection
with
which
her
instinct
had
led
her
to
conceal
herself
all
excitement
i
started
toward
her
at
once
but
purdy
put
his
hand
on
my
arm
wait
he
said
do
frighten
her
she
has
her
calf
there
no
i
exclaimed
for
i
could
see
nothing
of
it
we
went
cautiously
a
few
steps
nearer
she
threw
up
her
head
and
looked
at
us
so
wildly
for
a
moment
that
i
should
hardly
have
known
her
for
my
cow
she
was
indeed
for
the
time
being
a
wild
creature
of
the
wood
she
made
a
low
sound
and
advanced
a
step
threateningly
steady
said
purdy
this
is
her
first
calf
stop
a
minute
and
keep
quiet
she
soon
get
used
to
us
moving
to
one
side
cautiously
we
sat
down
on
an
old
log
the
brown
heifer
paused
every
muscle
tense
her
eyes
literally
blazing
we
sat
perfectly
still
after
a
minute
or
two
she
lowered
her
head
and
with
curious
guttural
sounds
she
began
to
lick
her
calf
which
lay
quite
hidden
in
the
bracken
she
has
chosen
a
perfect
spot
i
thought
to
myself
for
it
was
the
wildest
bit
of
forest
i
had
seen
anywhere
in
this
neighbourhood
at
one
side
not
far
off
rose
a
huge
gray
rock
partly
covered
on
one
side
with
moss
and
round
about
were
oaks
and
a
few
ash
trees
of
a
poor
scrubby
sort
else
they
would
long
ago
have
been
cut
out
the
earth
underneath
was
soft
and
springy
with
leaf
purdy
was
one
to
whom
silence
was
painful
he
fidgeted
about
evidently
bursting
with
talk
and
yet
feeling
compelled
to
follow
his
own
injunction
of
silence
presently
he
reached
into
his
capacious
pocket
and
handed
me
a
little
booklet
i
took
it
curious
and
read
the
title
is
there
a
hell
it
struck
me
humorously
in
the
country
we
are
always
at
least
some
of
us
are
more
or
less
in
a
religious
ferment
the
city
may
distract
itself
to
the
point
where
faith
is
unnecessary
but
in
the
country
we
must
perforce
have
something
to
believe
in
and
we
talk
about
it
too
i
read
the
title
aloud
but
in
a
low
voice
is
there
a
hell
then
i
asked
do
you
really
want
to
know
the
argument
is
all
there
he
replied
well
i
said
i
can
tell
you
out
of
my
own
experience
that
there
certainly
is
a
hell
he
turned
toward
me
with
evident
astonishment
but
i
proceeded
with
tranquillity
yes
sir
there
no
doubt
about
it
i
been
near
enough
myself
several
times
to
smell
the
smoke
it
is
around
here
i
said
as
he
looked
at
me
his
eyes
grew
larger
if
that
were
possible
and
his
serious
gentle
face
took
on
a
look
of
pained
surprise
before
you
say
such
things
he
said
i
beg
you
to
read
my
book
he
took
the
tract
from
my
hands
and
opened
it
on
his
knee
the
bible
tells
us
he
said
that
in
the
beginning
god
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
he
made
the
firmament
and
divided
the
waters
but
does
the
bible
say
that
he
created
a
hell
or
a
devil
does
it
i
shook
my
head
well
then
he
said
triumphantly
and
that
is
all
either
the
historian
moses
gives
in
detail
a
full
account
of
what
was
made
in
six
days
he
tells
how
day
and
night
were
created
how
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
were
made
he
tells
how
god
created
the
flowers
of
the
field
and
the
insects
and
the
birds
and
the
great
whales
and
said
fruitful
and
multiply
he
accounts
for
every
minute
of
the
time
in
the
entire
six
days
and
of
course
god
rested
on
the
seventh
and
there
is
not
one
word
about
hell
is
there
i
shook
my
head
well
then
exultantly
where
is
it
i
like
to
have
any
man
no
matter
how
wise
he
is
answer
that
where
is
it
that
i
said
has
troubled
me
too
we
do
always
know
just
where
our
hells
are
if
we
did
we
might
avoid
them
we
are
not
so
sensitive
to
them
as
we
should
be
do
you
think
he
looked
at
me
intently
i
went
on
before
he
could
answer
why
i
seen
men
in
my
time
living
from
day
to
day
in
the
very
atmosphere
of
perpetual
torment
and
actually
arguing
that
there
was
no
hell
it
is
a
strange
sight
i
assure
you
and
one
that
will
trouble
you
afterwards
from
what
i
know
of
hell
it
is
a
place
of
very
loose
boundaries
sometimes
i
thought
we
could
be
quite
sure
when
we
were
in
it
and
when
we
were
not
i
did
not
tell
my
friend
but
i
was
thinking
of
the
remark
of
old
swedenborg
the
trouble
with
hell
is
we
shall
not
know
it
when
we
arrive
at
this
point
purdy
burst
out
again
having
opened
his
little
book
at
another
page
when
adam
and
eve
had
sinned
he
said
and
the
god
of
heaven
walked
in
the
garden
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
and
called
for
them
and
they
had
hidden
themselves
on
account
of
their
disobedience
did
god
say
to
them
unless
you
repent
of
your
sins
and
get
forgiveness
i
will
shut
you
up
in
yon
dark
and
dismal
hell
and
torment
you
or
have
the
devil
do
it
for
ever
and
ever
was
there
such
a
word
i
shook
my
head
illustration
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
handed
me
a
little
booklet
no
sir
he
said
vehemently
there
was
not
but
does
it
say
i
asked
that
adam
and
eve
had
not
themselves
been
using
their
best
wits
in
creating
a
hell
that
point
has
occurred
to
me
in
my
experience
i
known
both
adams
and
eves
who
were
most
adroit
in
their
capacity
for
making
places
of
torment
and
afterwards
of
getting
into
them
just
watch
yourself
some
day
after
you
sown
a
crop
of
desires
and
you
see
promising
little
hells
starting
up
within
you
like
pigweeds
and
pusley
after
a
warm
rain
in
your
garden
and
our
heavens
too
for
that
matter
they
grow
to
our
own
planting
and
how
sensitive
they
are
too
how
soon
the
hot
wind
of
a
passion
withers
them
away
how
surely
the
fires
of
selfishness
blacken
their
perfection
i
almost
forgotten
purdy
and
when
i
looked
around
his
face
wore
a
peculiar
puzzled
expression
not
unmixed
with
alarm
he
held
up
his
little
book
eagerly
almost
in
my
face
if
god
had
intended
to
create
a
hell
he
said
i
assert
without
fear
of
successful
contradiction
that
when
god
was
there
in
the
garden
of
eden
it
was
the
time
for
him
to
have
put
adam
and
eve
and
all
their
posterity
on
notice
that
there
was
a
place
of
everlasting
torment
it
would
have
been
only
a
square
deal
for
him
to
do
so
but
did
he
i
shook
my
head
he
did
not
if
he
had
mentioned
hell
on
that
occasion
i
should
not
now
dispute
its
existence
but
he
did
not
this
is
what
he
said
to
adam
the
very
words
the
sweat
of
thy
face
shalt
thou
eat
bread
till
thou
return
unto
the
ground
for
out
of
it
thou
wast
taken
for
dust
thou
art
and
unto
dust
shalt
thou
return
you
see
he
did
not
say
hell
shalt
thou
return
he
said
dust
that
is
hell
is
it
well
i
said
there
are
in
my
experience
a
great
many
different
kinds
of
hells
there
are
almost
as
many
kinds
of
hells
as
there
are
men
and
women
upon
this
earth
now
your
hell
would
terrify
me
in
the
least
my
own
makes
me
no
end
of
trouble
talk
about
burning
pitch
and
brimstone
how
futile
were
the
imaginations
of
the
old
fellows
who
conjured
up
such
puerile
torments
why
i
can
tell
you
of
no
end
of
hells
that
are
worse
and
not
half
try
once
i
remember
when
i
was
younger
i
happened
to
glance
around
at
my
companion
he
sat
there
looking
at
me
with
horror
fascinated
horror
well
i
wo
disturb
your
peace
of
mind
by
telling
story
i
said
do
you
believe
that
we
shall
go
to
hell
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
that
depends
i
said
let
leave
out
the
question
of
let
be
more
comfortably
general
in
our
discussion
i
think
we
can
safely
say
that
some
go
and
some
do
not
it
a
curious
and
noteworthy
thing
i
said
but
i
known
of
cases
there
are
some
people
who
are
really
worth
good
honest
tormenting
let
alone
the
rewards
of
heavenly
bliss
they
just
have
anything
to
torment
what
is
going
to
become
of
such
folks
i
confess
i
do
know
you
remember
when
dante
began
his
journey
into
the
infernal
regions
i
do
believe
a
word
of
that
dante
he
interrupted
excitedly
all
a
made
up
story
there
is
a
word
of
truth
in
it
it
is
a
blasphemous
book
let
me
read
you
what
i
say
about
it
in
here
i
will
agree
with
you
without
argument
i
said
that
it
is
not
true
i
merely
wanted
to
speak
of
one
of
dante
experiences
as
an
illustration
of
the
point
i
making
you
remember
that
almost
the
first
spirits
he
met
on
his
journey
were
those
who
had
never
done
anything
in
this
life
to
merit
either
heaven
or
hell
that
always
struck
me
as
being
about
the
worst
plight
imaginable
for
a
human
being
think
of
a
creature
not
even
worth
good
honest
brimstone
since
i
came
home
i
looked
up
the
passage
and
it
is
a
wonderful
one
dante
heard
wailings
and
groans
and
terrible
things
said
in
many
tongues
yet
these
were
not
the
souls
of
the
wicked
they
were
only
those
who
had
lived
without
praise
or
blame
thinking
of
nothing
but
themselves
heaven
would
not
dull
its
brightness
with
those
nor
would
lower
hell
receive
them
and
what
is
it
asked
dante
that
makes
them
so
grievously
suffer
hopelessness
of
death
said
virgil
their
blind
existence
here
and
immemorable
former
life
make
them
so
wretched
that
they
envy
every
other
lot
mercy
and
justice
alike
disdain
them
let
us
speak
of
them
no
more
look
and
pass
but
purdy
in
spite
of
his
timidity
was
a
man
of
much
persistence
they
tell
me
he
said
when
they
try
to
prove
the
reasonableness
of
hell
that
unless
you
show
sinners
how
they
goin
to
be
tormented
they
never
repent
now
i
say
that
if
a
man
has
to
be
scared
into
religion
his
religion
ai
much
good
there
i
said
i
agree
with
you
completely
his
face
lighted
up
and
he
continued
eagerly
and
i
tell
you
just
go
ahead
and
try
for
heaven
do
pay
any
attention
to
all
this
talk
about
everlasting
punishment
good
advice
i
said
it
had
begun
to
grow
dark
the
brown
cow
was
quiet
at
last
we
could
hear
small
faint
sounds
from
the
calf
i
started
slowly
through
the
bracken
purdy
hung
at
my
elbow
stumbling
sideways
as
he
walked
but
continuing
to
talk
eagerly
so
we
came
to
the
place
where
the
calf
lay
i
spoke
in
a
low
voice
so
boss
so
boss
i
would
have
laid
my
hand
on
her
neck
but
she
started
back
with
a
wild
toss
of
her
horns
it
was
a
beautiful
calf
i
looked
at
it
with
a
peculiar
feeling
of
exultation
pride
ownership
it
was
with
a
round
curly
pate
and
one
white
leg
as
it
lay
curled
there
among
the
ferns
it
was
really
beautiful
to
look
at
when
we
approached
it
did
not
so
much
as
stir
i
lifted
it
to
its
legs
upon
which
the
cow
uttered
a
strange
cry
and
ran
a
few
steps
off
her
head
thrown
in
the
air
the
calf
fell
back
as
though
it
had
no
legs
she
is
telling
it
not
to
stand
up
said
purdy
i
had
been
afraid
at
first
that
something
was
the
matter
some
are
like
that
he
said
some
call
their
calves
to
run
others
wo
let
you
come
near
at
all
and
i
even
known
of
a
case
where
a
cow
gored
its
calf
to
death
rather
than
let
anyone
touch
it
i
looked
at
purdy
not
without
a
feeling
of
admiration
this
was
a
thing
he
knew
a
language
not
taught
in
the
universities
how
well
it
became
him
to
know
it
how
simply
he
expressed
it
i
thought
to
myself
there
are
not
many
men
in
this
world
after
all
that
it
will
not
pay
us
to
go
to
school
to
for
something
or
other
i
should
never
have
been
able
indeed
to
get
the
cow
and
calf
home
last
night
at
least
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
chance
friend
he
knew
exactly
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
he
wore
a
stout
coat
of
denim
rather
long
in
the
skirts
this
he
slipped
off
while
i
looked
on
in
some
astonishment
and
spread
it
out
on
the
ground
he
placed
my
staff
under
one
side
of
it
and
found
another
stick
nearly
the
same
size
for
the
other
side
these
he
wound
into
the
coat
until
he
had
made
a
sort
of
stretcher
upon
this
we
placed
the
unresisting
calf
what
a
fine
one
it
was
then
he
in
front
and
i
behind
we
carried
the
stretcher
and
its
burden
out
of
the
wood
the
cow
followed
sometimes
threatening
sometimes
bellowing
sometimes
starting
off
wildly
head
and
tail
in
the
air
only
to
rush
back
and
venturing
up
with
trembling
muscles
touch
her
tongue
to
the
calf
uttering
low
maternal
sounds
keep
steady
said
purdy
and
everything
be
all
right
when
we
came
to
the
brook
we
stopped
to
rest
i
think
my
companion
would
have
liked
to
start
his
argument
again
but
he
was
too
short
of
breath
it
was
a
prime
spring
evening
the
frogs
were
tuning
up
i
heard
a
drowsy
cowbell
somewhere
over
the
hills
in
the
pasture
the
brown
cow
with
eager
outstretched
neck
was
licking
her
calf
as
it
lay
there
on
the
improvised
stretcher
i
looked
up
at
the
sky
a
blue
avenue
of
heaven
between
the
tree
tops
i
felt
the
peculiar
sense
of
mystery
which
nature
so
commonly
conveys
i
have
been
too
sure
i
said
what
do
we
know
after
all
why
may
there
not
be
future
heavens
and
hells
heavens
for
other
earths
we
do
not
know
we
do
not
so
carrying
the
calf
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
we
came
at
last
to
my
yard
we
had
no
sooner
put
the
calf
down
than
it
jumped
nimbly
to
its
feet
and
ran
wobbling
absurdly
to
meet
its
mother
the
rascal
i
said
after
all
our
work
it
the
nature
of
the
animal
said
purdy
as
he
put
on
his
coat
i
could
not
thank
him
enough
i
invited
him
to
stay
with
us
to
supper
but
he
said
he
must
hurry
home
then
come
down
soon
to
see
me
i
said
and
we
will
settle
this
question
as
to
the
existence
of
a
hell
he
stepped
up
close
to
me
and
said
with
an
appealing
note
in
his
voice
you
do
not
really
believe
in
a
hell
do
you
how
human
nature
loves
collusiveness
nothing
short
of
the
categorical
will
satisfy
us
what
i
said
to
purdy
evidently
appeased
him
for
he
seized
my
hand
and
shook
and
shook
we
have
understood
each
other
he
said
eagerly
you
do
believe
in
eternal
damnation
any
more
than
i
do
then
he
added
as
though
some
new
uncertainty
puzzled
him
do
you
at
supper
i
was
telling
harriet
with
gusto
of
my
experiences
suddenly
she
broke
out
what
was
his
name
purdy
why
he
the
infidel
that
horace
tells
about
is
that
possible
i
said
and
i
dropped
my
knife
and
fork
the
strangest
sensation
came
over
me
why
i
said
then
i
an
infidel
too
so
i
laughed
and
i
been
laughing
gloriously
ever
since
at
myself
at
the
infidel
at
the
entire
neighbourhood
i
recalled
that
delightful
character
in
the
vicar
of
wakefield
my
friend
the
scotch
preacher
loves
to
tell
about
him
who
seasons
error
by
crying
out
fudge
fudge
i
said
we
all
poor
sinners
xi
the
country
doctor
afternoon
june
we
had
a
funeral
in
this
community
and
the
longest
funeral
procession
charles
baxter
says
he
has
seen
in
all
the
years
of
his
memory
among
these
hills
a
good
man
has
gone
away
and
yet
remains
in
the
comparatively
short
time
i
have
been
here
i
never
came
to
know
him
well
personally
though
i
saw
him
often
in
the
country
roads
a
ruddy
old
gentleman
with
thick
coarse
hair
somewhat
stern
of
countenance
somewhat
shabby
of
attire
sitting
as
erect
as
a
trooper
in
his
open
buggy
one
muscular
hand
resting
on
his
knee
the
other
holding
the
reins
of
his
familiar
old
white
horse
i
said
i
did
not
come
to
know
him
well
personally
and
yet
no
one
who
knows
this
community
can
help
knowing
doctor
john
north
i
never
so
desired
the
gift
of
moving
expression
as
i
do
at
this
moment
on
my
return
from
his
funeral
that
i
may
give
some
faint
idea
of
what
a
good
man
means
to
a
community
like
ours
as
the
more
complete
knowledge
of
it
has
come
to
me
in
the
district
school
that
i
attended
when
a
boy
we
used
to
love
to
leave
our
mark
as
we
called
it
wherever
our
rovings
led
us
it
was
a
bit
of
boyish
mysticism
unaccountable
now
that
we
have
grown
older
and
wiser
perhaps
but
it
had
its
meaning
it
was
an
instinctive
outreaching
of
the
young
soul
to
perpetuate
the
knowledge
of
its
existence
upon
this
forgetful
earth
my
mark
i
remember
was
a
notch
and
a
cross
with
what
secret
fond
diligence
i
carved
it
in
the
gray
bark
of
beech
trees
on
fence
posts
or
on
barn
doors
and
once
i
remember
on
the
of
our
home
and
once
with
high
imaginings
of
how
long
it
would
remain
i
spent
hours
chiseling
it
deep
in
a
old
boulder
in
the
pasture
where
if
man
has
been
as
kind
as
nature
it
remains
to
this
day
if
you
should
chance
to
see
it
you
would
not
know
of
the
boy
who
carved
it
there
so
doctor
north
left
his
secret
mark
upon
the
neighbourhood
as
all
of
us
do
for
good
or
for
ill
upon
neighbourhoods
in
accordance
with
the
strength
of
that
character
which
abides
within
us
for
a
long
time
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
he
though
it
was
not
difficult
to
see
that
some
strong
good
man
had
often
passed
this
way
i
saw
the
mystic
sign
of
him
in
the
hearthstone
of
a
home
i
heard
it
speaking
bravely
from
the
weak
lips
of
a
friend
it
is
carved
in
the
plastic
heart
of
many
a
boy
no
i
do
not
doubt
the
immortalities
of
the
soul
in
this
community
which
i
have
come
to
love
so
much
dwells
more
than
one
of
john
north
immortalities
and
will
continue
to
dwell
i
too
live
more
deeply
because
john
north
was
here
he
was
in
no
outward
way
an
extraordinary
man
nor
was
his
life
eventful
he
was
born
in
this
neighbourhood
i
saw
him
lying
quite
still
this
morning
in
the
same
sunny
room
of
the
same
house
where
he
first
saw
the
light
of
day
here
among
these
common
hills
he
grew
up
and
save
for
the
few
years
he
spent
at
school
or
in
the
army
he
lived
here
all
his
life
long
in
old
neighbourhoods
and
especially
farm
neighbourhoods
people
come
to
know
one
another
not
clothes
knowledge
or
money
knowledge
but
that
sort
of
knowledge
which
reaches
down
into
the
hidden
springs
of
human
character
a
country
community
may
be
deceived
by
a
stranger
too
easily
deceived
but
not
by
one
of
its
own
people
for
it
is
not
a
studied
knowledge
it
resembles
that
slow
geologic
uncovering
before
which
not
even
the
deep
buried
bones
of
the
prehistoric
saurian
remain
finally
hidden
i
never
fully
realised
until
this
morning
what
a
supreme
triumph
it
is
having
grown
old
to
merit
the
respect
of
those
who
know
us
best
mere
greatness
offers
no
reward
to
compare
with
it
for
greatness
compels
that
homage
which
we
freely
bestow
upon
goodness
so
long
as
i
live
i
shall
never
forget
this
morning
i
stood
in
the
outside
of
the
open
window
of
the
old
doctor
home
it
was
soft
and
warm
and
very
still
a
june
sunday
morning
an
apple
tree
not
far
off
was
still
in
blossom
and
across
the
road
on
a
grassy
hillside
sheep
fed
unconcernedly
occasionally
from
the
roadway
where
the
horses
of
the
countryside
were
waiting
i
heard
the
clink
of
a
or
the
low
voice
of
some
seeking
a
place
to
hitch
not
half
those
who
came
could
find
room
in
the
house
they
stood
uncovered
among
the
trees
from
within
wafted
through
the
window
came
the
faint
odour
of
flowers
and
the
occasional
minor
intonation
of
someone
speaking
and
finally
our
own
scotch
preacher
i
could
not
see
him
but
there
lay
in
the
cadences
of
his
voice
a
peculiar
note
of
peacefulness
of
finality
the
day
before
he
died
north
had
said
i
want
mcalway
to
conduct
my
funeral
not
as
a
minister
but
as
a
man
he
has
been
my
friend
for
forty
years
he
will
know
what
i
mean
the
scotch
preacher
did
not
say
much
why
should
he
everyone
there
and
speech
would
only
have
cheapened
what
we
knew
and
i
do
not
now
recall
even
the
little
he
said
for
there
was
so
much
all
about
me
that
spoke
not
of
the
death
of
a
good
man
but
of
his
life
a
boy
who
stood
near
me
a
boy
no
longer
for
he
was
as
tall
as
a
man
gave
a
more
eloquent
tribute
than
any
preacher
could
have
done
i
saw
him
stand
his
ground
for
a
time
with
that
grim
courage
of
youth
which
dreads
emotion
more
than
a
battle
and
then
i
saw
him
crying
behind
a
tree
he
was
not
a
relative
of
the
old
doctor
he
was
only
one
of
many
into
whose
deep
life
the
doctor
had
entered
they
sang
lead
kindly
light
and
came
out
through
the
narrow
doorway
into
the
sunshine
with
the
coffin
the
hats
of
the
pallbearers
in
a
row
on
top
and
there
was
hardly
a
dry
eye
among
us
and
as
they
came
out
through
the
narrow
doorway
i
thought
how
the
doctor
must
have
looked
out
daily
through
so
many
many
years
upon
this
beauty
of
hills
and
fields
and
of
sky
above
grown
dearer
from
long
familiarity
which
he
would
know
no
more
and
kate
north
the
sister
his
only
relative
followed
behind
her
fine
old
face
gray
and
set
but
without
a
tear
in
her
eye
how
like
the
doctor
she
looked
the
same
stern
control
in
the
hours
which
followed
on
the
pleasant
winding
way
to
the
cemetery
in
the
groups
under
the
trees
on
the
way
homeward
again
the
community
spoke
its
true
heart
and
i
have
come
back
with
the
feeling
that
human
nature
at
bottom
is
sound
and
sweet
i
knew
a
great
deal
before
about
doctor
north
but
i
knew
it
as
knowledge
not
as
emotion
and
therefore
it
was
not
really
a
part
of
my
life
i
heard
again
the
stories
of
how
he
drove
the
country
roads
winter
and
summer
how
he
had
seen
most
of
the
population
into
the
world
and
had
held
the
hands
of
many
who
went
out
it
was
the
plain
hard
life
of
a
country
doctor
and
yet
it
seemed
to
rise
in
our
community
like
some
great
tree
its
roots
deep
buried
in
the
soil
of
our
common
life
its
branches
close
to
the
sky
to
those
accustomed
to
the
outward
excitements
of
city
life
it
would
have
seemed
barren
and
uneventful
it
was
significant
that
the
talk
was
not
so
much
of
what
the
doctor
did
as
of
he
did
it
not
so
much
of
his
actions
as
of
the
natural
expression
of
his
character
and
when
we
come
to
think
of
it
goodness
uneventful
it
does
not
flash
it
glows
it
is
deep
quiet
and
very
simple
it
passes
not
with
oratory
it
is
commonly
foreign
to
riches
nor
does
it
often
sit
in
the
places
of
the
mighty
but
may
be
felt
in
the
touch
of
a
friendly
hand
or
the
look
of
a
kindly
eye
outwardly
john
north
often
gave
the
impression
of
brusqueness
many
a
woman
going
to
him
for
the
first
time
and
until
she
learned
that
he
was
in
reality
as
gentle
as
a
girl
was
frightened
by
his
manner
the
country
is
full
of
stories
of
such
encounters
we
laugh
yet
over
the
adventure
of
a
woman
who
formerly
came
to
spend
her
summers
here
she
dressed
very
beautifully
and
was
nervous
one
day
she
went
to
call
on
the
doctor
he
made
a
careful
examination
and
asked
many
questions
finally
he
said
with
portentous
solemnity
madam
you
suffering
from
a
very
common
complaint
the
doctor
paused
then
continued
impressively
you
have
enough
work
to
do
this
is
what
i
would
advise
go
home
discharge
your
servants
do
your
own
cooking
wash
your
own
clothes
and
make
your
own
beds
you
get
well
she
is
reported
to
have
been
much
offended
and
yet
there
was
a
wreath
of
white
roses
in
doctor
north
room
sent
from
the
city
by
that
woman
if
he
really
hated
anything
in
this
world
the
doctor
hated
whimperers
he
had
a
deep
sense
of
the
purpose
and
need
of
punishment
and
he
despised
those
who
fled
from
wholesome
discipline
a
young
fellow
once
went
to
the
doctor
so
they
tell
the
story
and
asked
for
something
to
stop
his
pain
stop
it
exclaimed
the
doctor
why
it
good
for
you
you
done
wrong
have
you
well
you
being
punished
take
it
like
a
man
there
nothing
more
wholesome
than
good
honest
pain
and
yet
how
much
pain
he
alleviated
in
this
community
in
forty
years
the
deep
sense
that
a
man
should
stand
up
to
his
fate
was
one
of
the
of
his
character
and
the
way
he
taught
it
not
only
by
word
but
by
every
action
of
his
life
put
heart
into
many
a
weak
man
and
woman
patterson
a
friend
of
ours
tells
of
a
reply
she
once
had
from
the
doctor
to
whom
she
had
gone
with
a
new
trouble
after
telling
him
about
it
she
said
i
left
it
all
with
the
lord
you
have
done
better
said
the
doctor
to
keep
it
yourself
trouble
is
for
your
discipline
the
lord
does
need
it
it
was
thus
out
of
his
wisdom
that
he
was
always
telling
people
what
they
knew
deep
down
in
their
hearts
to
be
true
it
sometimes
hurt
at
first
but
sooner
or
later
if
the
man
had
a
spark
of
real
manhood
in
him
he
came
back
and
gave
the
doctor
an
abiding
affection
there
were
those
who
though
they
loved
him
called
him
intolerant
i
never
could
look
at
it
that
way
he
have
the
only
kind
of
intolerance
which
is
at
all
tolerable
and
that
is
the
intolerance
of
intolerance
he
always
set
himself
with
vigour
against
that
unreason
and
lack
of
sympathy
which
are
the
essence
of
intolerance
and
yet
there
was
a
rock
of
conviction
on
many
subjects
behind
which
he
could
not
be
driven
it
was
not
intolerance
it
was
with
him
a
reasoned
certainty
of
belief
he
had
a
phrase
to
express
that
not
uncommon
state
of
mind
in
this
age
particularly
which
is
politely
willing
to
yield
its
foothold
within
this
universe
to
almost
any
reasoner
who
suggests
some
other
universe
however
shadowy
to
stand
upon
he
called
it
a
mush
of
concession
he
might
have
been
wrong
in
his
convictions
but
he
at
least
never
floundered
in
a
mush
of
concession
i
heard
him
say
once
there
are
some
things
a
man
ca
concede
and
one
is
that
a
man
who
has
broken
a
law
like
a
man
who
has
broken
a
leg
has
got
to
suffer
for
it
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
he
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
present
a
bill
it
was
not
because
the
community
was
poor
though
some
of
our
people
are
poor
and
it
was
certainly
not
because
the
doctor
was
rich
and
could
afford
such
philanthropy
for
saving
a
rather
unproductive
farm
which
during
the
last
ten
years
of
his
life
lay
wholly
uncultivated
he
was
as
poor
as
any
man
in
the
community
he
simply
seemed
to
forget
that
people
owed
him
it
came
to
be
a
common
and
humorous
experience
for
people
to
go
to
the
doctor
and
say
now
doctor
north
how
much
do
i
owe
you
you
remember
you
attended
my
wife
two
years
ago
when
the
baby
came
and
john
when
he
had
the
diphtheria
yes
yes
said
the
doctor
i
remember
i
thought
i
ought
to
pay
you
well
i
look
it
up
when
i
get
time
but
he
would
the
only
way
was
to
go
to
him
and
say
doctor
i
want
to
pay
ten
dollars
on
account
all
right
he
answer
and
take
the
money
to
the
credit
of
the
community
i
may
say
with
truthfulness
that
the
doctor
never
suffered
he
was
even
able
to
supply
himself
with
the
best
instruments
that
money
could
buy
to
him
nothing
was
too
good
for
our
neighbourhood
this
morning
i
saw
in
a
case
at
his
home
a
complete
set
of
oculist
instruments
said
to
be
the
best
in
the
county
a
very
unusual
equipment
for
a
country
doctor
indeed
he
assumed
that
the
responsibility
for
the
health
of
the
community
rested
upon
him
he
was
a
sort
of
health
officer
he
was
always
sniffing
about
for
old
wells
and
damp
cellars
and
somehow
with
his
crisp
humour
and
sound
sense
getting
them
cleaned
in
his
old
age
he
even
grew
querulously
particular
about
these
things
asking
a
little
more
of
human
nature
than
it
could
quite
accomplish
there
were
innumerable
other
ways
how
they
came
out
all
glorified
now
that
he
is
gone
in
which
he
served
the
community
horace
tells
how
he
once
met
the
doctor
driving
his
old
white
horse
in
the
town
road
horace
called
the
doctor
why
do
you
paint
your
barn
well
said
horace
it
beginning
to
look
a
bit
shabby
horace
said
the
doctor
you
a
prominent
citizen
we
look
to
you
to
keep
up
the
credit
of
the
neighbourhood
horace
painted
his
barn
i
think
doctor
north
was
fonder
of
charles
baxter
than
of
anyone
else
save
his
sister
he
hated
sham
and
cant
if
a
man
had
a
single
in
him
the
old
doctor
found
it
and
charles
baxter
in
many
ways
exceeds
any
man
i
ever
knew
in
the
downright
quality
of
genuineness
the
doctor
was
never
tired
of
telling
and
with
humour
how
he
once
went
to
baxter
to
have
a
table
made
for
his
office
when
he
came
to
get
it
he
found
the
table
upside
clown
and
baxter
on
his
knees
finishing
off
the
under
part
of
the
drawer
slides
baxter
looked
up
and
smiled
in
the
engaging
way
he
has
and
continued
his
work
after
watching
him
for
some
time
the
doctor
said
baxter
why
do
you
spend
so
much
time
on
that
table
who
going
to
know
whether
or
not
the
last
touch
has
been
put
on
the
under
side
of
it
baxter
straightened
up
and
looked
at
the
doctor
in
surprise
why
i
will
he
said
how
the
doctor
loved
to
tell
that
story
i
warrant
there
is
no
boy
who
ever
grew
up
in
this
country
who
has
heard
it
it
was
a
part
of
his
pride
in
finding
reality
that
made
the
doctor
such
a
lover
of
true
sentiment
and
such
a
hater
of
sentimentality
i
prize
one
memory
of
him
which
illustrates
this
point
the
district
school
gave
a
speaking
and
we
all
went
one
boy
with
a
fresh
young
voice
spoke
a
soldier
piece
the
soliloquy
of
a
veteran
who
sits
at
a
window
and
sees
the
troops
go
by
with
dancing
banners
and
glittering
bayonets
and
the
people
cheering
and
shouting
and
the
refrain
went
something
like
this
never
again
call
to
the
men
who
were
comrades
for
years
never
again
call
to
the
men
we
think
of
with
tears
i
happened
to
look
around
while
the
boy
was
speaking
and
there
sat
the
old
doctor
with
the
tears
rolling
unheeded
down
his
ruddy
face
he
was
thinking
no
doubt
of
war
time
and
the
comrades
knew
on
the
other
hand
how
he
despised
fustian
and
bombast
his
bah
delivered
explosively
was
often
like
a
breath
of
fresh
air
in
a
stuffy
room
several
years
ago
before
i
came
here
and
it
is
one
of
the
historic
stories
of
the
county
there
was
a
fourth
of
july
celebration
with
a
number
of
ambitious
orators
one
of
them
a
young
fellow
of
small
worth
who
wanted
to
be
elected
to
the
legislature
made
an
impassioned
address
on
patriotism
the
doctor
was
present
for
he
liked
gatherings
he
liked
people
but
he
did
not
like
the
young
orator
and
did
not
want
him
to
be
elected
in
the
midst
of
the
speech
while
the
audience
was
being
carried
through
the
clouds
of
oratory
the
doctor
was
seen
to
be
growing
more
and
more
uneasy
finally
he
burst
out
bah
the
orator
caught
himself
and
then
swept
on
again
bah
said
the
doctor
by
this
time
the
audience
was
really
interested
the
orator
stopped
he
knew
the
doctor
and
he
should
have
known
better
than
to
say
what
he
did
but
he
was
very
young
and
he
knew
the
doctor
was
opposing
him
perhaps
he
remarked
sarcastically
the
doctor
can
make
a
better
speech
than
i
can
the
doctor
rose
instantly
to
his
full
height
and
he
was
an
man
perhaps
he
said
i
can
and
what
is
more
i
will
he
stood
up
on
a
chair
and
gave
them
a
talk
on
patriotism
real
patriotism
the
patriotism
of
duty
done
in
the
small
concerns
of
life
that
speech
which
ended
the
political
career
of
the
orator
is
not
forgotten
one
thing
i
heard
about
the
old
doctor
impressed
me
deeply
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
ever
since
it
illuminates
his
character
more
than
anything
i
have
heard
it
is
singular
too
that
i
should
not
have
known
the
story
before
i
do
believe
it
was
because
it
all
happened
so
long
ago
it
rather
remained
untold
out
of
deference
to
a
sort
of
neighbourhood
delicacy
i
had
indeed
wondered
why
a
man
of
such
capacities
so
many
qualities
of
real
greatness
and
power
should
have
escaped
a
city
career
i
said
something
to
this
effect
to
a
group
of
men
with
whom
i
was
talking
this
morning
i
thought
they
exchanged
glances
one
said
when
he
first
came
out
of
the
army
he
made
such
a
fine
record
as
a
surgeon
that
him
to
go
to
the
city
and
practice
a
pause
followed
which
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
fill
but
he
did
go
i
said
no
he
did
go
he
was
a
brilliant
young
fellow
he
a
lot
and
he
was
popular
too
he
have
had
a
great
success
another
pause
but
he
did
go
i
asked
promptingly
no
he
staid
here
he
was
better
educated
than
any
man
in
this
county
why
i
seen
him
once
pick
up
a
book
of
latin
and
read
it
i
could
see
that
all
this
was
purposely
irrelevant
and
i
liked
them
for
it
but
walking
home
from
the
cemetery
horace
gave
me
the
story
the
community
knew
it
to
the
last
detail
i
suppose
it
is
a
story
not
uncommon
among
men
but
this
morning
told
of
the
old
doctor
we
had
just
laid
away
it
struck
me
with
a
tragic
poignancy
difficult
to
describe
yes
said
horace
he
was
to
have
been
married
forty
years
ago
and
the
match
was
broken
off
because
he
was
a
drunkard
a
drunkard
i
exclaimed
with
a
shock
i
can
not
convey
yes
sir
said
horace
one
o
the
worst
you
ever
see
he
got
it
in
the
army
handsome
wild
brilliant
that
was
the
doctor
i
was
a
little
boy
but
i
remember
it
mighty
well
he
told
me
the
whole
distressing
story
it
was
all
a
long
time
ago
and
the
details
do
not
matter
now
it
was
to
be
expected
that
a
man
like
the
old
doctor
should
love
love
once
and
love
as
few
men
do
and
that
is
what
he
did
and
the
girl
left
him
because
he
was
a
drunkard
they
all
thought
said
horace
that
he
up
an
kill
himself
he
said
he
would
but
he
did
instid
o
that
he
put
an
open
bottle
on
his
table
and
he
looked
at
it
and
said
is
stronger
now
you
or
john
north
we
make
that
the
test
he
said
live
or
die
by
that
them
was
his
exact
words
he
could
sleep
nights
and
he
got
haggard
like
a
sick
man
but
he
left
the
bottle
there
and
never
touched
it
how
my
heart
throbbed
with
the
thought
of
that
old
silent
struggle
how
much
it
explained
how
near
it
brought
all
these
people
around
him
it
made
him
so
human
it
is
the
tragic
necessity
but
the
salvation
of
many
a
man
that
he
should
come
finally
to
an
irretrievable
experience
to
the
assurance
that
everything
is
lost
for
with
that
moment
if
he
be
strong
he
is
saved
i
wonder
if
anyone
ever
attains
real
human
sympathy
who
has
not
passed
through
the
fire
of
some
such
experience
or
to
humour
either
for
in
the
best
laughter
do
we
not
hear
constantly
that
deep
minor
note
which
speaks
of
the
ache
in
the
human
heart
it
seems
to
me
i
can
understand
doctor
north
he
died
friday
morning
he
had
been
lying
very
quiet
all
night
suddenly
he
opened
his
eyes
and
said
to
his
sister
kate
and
shut
them
again
that
was
all
the
last
call
had
come
and
he
was
ready
for
it
i
looked
at
his
face
after
death
i
saw
the
iron
lines
of
that
old
struggle
in
his
mouth
and
chin
and
the
humour
that
it
brought
him
in
the
lines
around
his
eyes
and
as
i
think
of
him
this
afternoon
i
can
see
him
curiously
for
i
can
hardly
explain
it
carrying
a
banner
as
in
battle
right
here
among
our
quiet
hills
and
those
he
leads
seem
to
be
the
people
we
know
the
men
and
the
women
and
the
boys
he
is
the
hero
of
a
new
age
in
olden
days
he
might
have
been
a
pioneer
carrying
the
light
of
civilisation
to
a
new
land
here
he
has
been
a
sort
of
moral
pioneer
a
pioneering
far
more
difficult
than
any
we
have
ever
known
there
are
no
heroics
connected
with
it
the
name
of
the
pioneer
will
not
go
ringing
down
the
ages
for
it
is
a
silent
leadership
and
its
success
is
measured
by
victories
in
other
lives
we
see
it
now
only
too
dimly
when
he
is
gone
we
reflect
sadly
that
we
did
not
stop
to
thank
him
how
busy
we
were
with
our
own
affairs
when
he
was
among
us
i
wonder
is
there
anyone
here
to
take
up
the
banner
he
has
laid
down
i
forgot
to
say
that
the
scotch
preacher
chose
the
most
impressive
text
in
the
bible
for
his
talk
at
the
funeral
he
that
is
greatest
among
you
let
him
be
as
he
that
doth
serve
and
we
came
away
with
a
nameless
aching
sense
of
loss
thinking
how
perhaps
in
a
small
way
we
might
do
something
for
somebody
else
as
the
old
doctor
did
xii
an
evening
at
home
how
calm
and
quiet
a
delight
is
it
alone
to
read
and
meditate
and
write
by
none
offended
and
offending
none
to
walk
ride
sit
or
sleep
at
one
own
ease
and
pleasing
a
man
self
none
other
to
displease
cotton
a
friend
of
izaak
during
the
last
few
months
so
many
of
the
real
adventures
of
life
have
been
out
of
doors
and
so
much
of
the
beauty
too
that
i
have
scarcely
written
a
word
about
my
books
in
the
summer
the
days
are
so
long
and
the
work
so
engrossing
that
a
farmer
is
quite
willing
to
sit
quietly
on
his
porch
after
supper
and
watch
the
long
evenings
fall
and
rest
his
tired
back
and
go
to
bed
early
but
the
winter
is
the
true
time
for
indoor
enjoyment
days
like
these
a
cold
night
after
a
cold
day
well
wrapped
you
have
made
arctic
explorations
to
the
stable
the
and
the
you
have
dug
your
way
energetically
to
the
front
gate
stopping
every
few
minutes
to
beat
your
arms
around
your
shoulders
and
watch
the
white
plume
of
your
breath
in
the
still
air
and
you
have
rushed
in
gladly
to
the
warmth
of
the
and
the
supper
after
such
a
day
how
sharp
your
appetite
how
good
the
taste
of
food
harriet
brown
bread
moist
with
thick
sweet
dark
crusts
was
never
quite
so
delicious
and
when
the
meal
is
finished
you
push
back
your
chair
feeling
like
a
sort
of
lord
that
was
a
good
supper
harriet
you
say
expansively
was
it
she
asks
modestly
but
with
evident
pleasure
cookery
you
remark
is
the
greatest
art
in
the
world
oh
you
were
hungry
next
to
poetry
you
conclude
and
much
better
appreciated
think
how
easy
it
is
to
find
a
poet
who
will
turn
you
a
presentable
sonnet
and
how
very
difficult
it
is
to
find
a
cook
who
will
turn
you
an
edible
beefsteak
i
said
a
good
deal
more
on
this
subject
which
i
shall
not
attempt
to
repeat
harriet
did
not
listen
through
it
all
she
knows
what
i
am
capable
of
when
i
really
get
started
and
she
has
her
limits
a
practical
person
harriet
when
i
have
gone
about
so
far
she
begins
clearing
the
table
or
takes
up
her
mending
but
i
do
mind
it
at
all
having
begun
talking
it
is
wonderful
how
pleasant
one
own
voice
becomes
and
think
of
having
a
clear
field
and
no
interruptions
my
own
particular
room
where
i
am
permitted
to
revel
in
the
desert
of
my
own
disorder
opens
comfortably
off
the
a
lamp
with
a
green
shade
stands
invitingly
on
the
table
shedding
a
circle
of
light
on
the
books
and
papers
underneath
but
leaving
all
the
remainder
of
the
room
in
dim
pleasantness
at
one
side
stands
a
comfortable
big
chair
with
everything
in
arm
reach
including
my
note
books
and
ink
bottle
where
i
sit
i
can
look
out
through
the
open
doorway
and
see
harriet
near
the
fireplace
rocking
and
sewing
sometimes
she
hums
a
little
tune
which
i
never
confess
to
hearing
lest
i
miss
some
of
the
unconscious
cadences
let
the
wind
blow
outside
and
the
snow
drift
in
piles
around
the
doorway
and
the
blinds
rattle
i
have
before
me
a
whole
long
pleasant
evening
what
a
convenient
and
delightful
world
is
this
world
of
books
if
you
bring
to
it
not
the
obligations
of
the
student
or
look
upon
it
as
an
opiate
for
idleness
but
enter
it
rather
with
the
enthusiasm
of
the
adventurer
it
has
vast
advantages
over
the
ordinary
world
of
daylight
of
barter
and
trade
of
work
and
worry
in
this
world
every
man
is
his
own
king
the
sort
of
king
one
loves
to
imagine
not
concerned
in
such
petty
matters
as
wars
and
parliaments
and
taxes
but
a
mellow
and
moderate
despot
who
is
a
true
patron
of
genius
a
mild
old
chap
who
has
in
his
court
the
greatest
men
and
women
in
the
world
and
all
of
them
vying
to
please
the
most
vagrant
of
his
moods
invite
any
one
of
them
to
talk
and
if
your
highness
is
not
pleased
with
him
you
have
only
to
put
him
back
in
his
corner
and
bring
some
jester
to
sharpen
the
laughter
of
your
highness
or
some
poet
to
set
your
faintest
emotion
to
music
i
have
marked
a
certain
servility
in
books
they
entreat
you
for
a
hearing
they
cry
out
from
their
cases
like
men
in
an
eternal
struggle
for
survival
for
immortality
take
me
pleads
this
one
i
am
responsive
to
every
mood
you
will
find
in
me
love
and
hate
virtue
and
vice
i
do
preach
i
give
you
life
as
it
is
you
will
find
here
adventures
cunningly
linked
with
romance
and
seasoned
to
suit
the
most
fastidious
taste
try
hear
such
talk
cries
his
neighbour
he
fiction
what
he
says
never
happened
at
all
he
tries
hard
to
make
you
believe
it
but
it
true
not
a
word
of
it
now
i
fact
everything
you
find
in
me
can
be
depended
upon
yes
responds
the
other
but
who
cares
nobody
wants
to
read
you
you
dull
you
false
as
their
voices
grow
shriller
with
argument
your
highness
listens
with
the
indulgent
smile
of
royalty
when
its
courtiers
contend
for
its
favour
knowing
that
their
very
life
depends
upon
a
wrinkle
in
your
august
brow
as
for
me
i
confess
to
being
a
rather
crusty
despot
when
horace
was
over
here
the
other
evening
talking
learnedly
about
silos
and
ensilage
i
admit
that
i
became
the
very
pattern
of
humility
but
when
i
take
my
place
in
the
throne
of
my
with
the
light
from
the
lamp
falling
on
the
open
pages
of
my
book
i
assure
you
i
am
decidedly
an
autocratic
person
my
retainers
must
distinctly
keep
their
places
i
have
my
court
favourites
upon
whom
i
lavish
the
richest
gifts
of
my
attention
i
reserve
for
them
a
special
place
in
the
worn
case
nearest
my
person
where
at
the
mere
outreaching
of
an
idle
hand
i
can
summon
them
to
beguile
my
moods
the
necessary
slavies
of
literature
i
have
arranged
in
indistinct
rows
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
where
they
can
be
had
if
i
require
their
special
accomplishments
how
little
after
all
learning
counts
in
this
world
either
in
books
or
in
men
i
have
often
been
awed
by
the
wealth
of
information
i
have
discovered
in
a
man
or
a
book
i
have
been
awed
and
depressed
how
wonderful
i
have
thought
that
one
brain
should
hold
so
much
should
be
so
infallible
in
a
world
of
fallibility
but
i
have
observed
how
soon
and
completely
such
a
fount
of
information
dissipates
itself
having
only
things
to
give
it
comes
finally
to
the
end
of
its
things
it
is
empty
what
it
has
hived
up
so
painfully
through
many
a
studious
year
comes
now
to
be
common
property
we
pass
that
way
take
our
share
and
do
not
even
say
thank
you
learning
is
like
money
it
is
of
prodigious
satisfaction
to
the
possessor
thereof
but
once
given
forth
it
diffuses
itself
swiftly
what
have
you
we
are
ever
asking
of
those
we
meet
information
learning
money
we
take
it
cruelly
and
pass
onward
for
such
is
the
law
of
material
possessions
what
have
you
we
ask
charm
personality
character
the
great
gift
of
unexpectedness
how
we
draw
you
to
us
we
take
you
in
poor
or
ignorant
though
you
may
be
we
link
arms
and
loiter
we
love
you
not
for
what
you
have
or
what
you
give
us
but
for
what
you
are
i
have
several
good
friends
excellent
people
who
act
always
as
i
expect
them
to
act
there
is
no
flight
more
than
once
i
have
listened
to
the
edifying
conversation
of
a
certain
sturdy
old
gentleman
whom
i
know
and
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
have
thought
lord
if
he
would
jump
up
now
and
turn
an
intellectual
handspring
or
slap
me
on
the
back
figuratively
of
course
the
other
would
be
unthinkable
or
yes
swear
i
think
i
could
love
him
but
he
never
does
and
i
afraid
he
never
will
when
i
speak
then
of
my
books
you
will
know
what
i
mean
the
chief
charm
of
literature
old
or
new
lies
in
its
high
quality
of
surprise
unexpectedness
spontaneity
high
spirits
applied
to
life
we
can
fairly
hear
some
of
the
old
chaps
you
and
i
know
laughing
down
through
the
centuries
how
we
love
they
laughed
for
themselves
not
for
us
yes
there
must
be
surprise
in
the
books
that
i
keep
in
the
worn
case
at
my
elbow
the
surprise
of
a
new
personality
perceiving
for
the
first
time
the
beauty
the
wonder
the
humour
the
tragedy
the
greatness
of
truth
it
does
matter
at
all
whether
the
writer
is
a
poet
a
scientist
a
traveller
an
essayist
or
a
mere
daily
if
he
have
the
grace
of
wonder
what
on
are
you
laughing
about
cries
harriet
from
the
when
i
have
caught
my
breath
i
say
holding
up
my
book
this
absurd
man
here
is
telling
of
the
adventures
of
a
certain
chivalrous
knight
but
i
ca
see
how
you
can
laugh
out
like
that
sitting
all
alone
there
why
it
uncanny
you
do
know
the
knight
harriet
nor
his
squire
sancho
you
talk
of
them
just
as
though
they
were
real
persons
real
i
exclaim
real
why
they
are
much
more
real
than
most
of
the
people
we
know
horace
is
a
mere
wraith
compared
with
sancho
and
then
i
rush
out
let
me
read
you
this
i
say
and
i
read
that
matchless
chapter
wherein
the
knight
having
clapped
on
his
head
the
helmet
which
sancho
has
inadvertently
used
as
a
receptacle
for
a
dinner
of
curds
and
sweating
whey
profusely
goes
forth
to
fight
two
fierce
lions
as
i
proceed
with
that
prodigious
story
i
can
see
harriet
gradually
forgetting
her
sewing
and
i
read
on
the
more
furiously
until
coming
to
the
point
of
the
conflict
wherein
the
generous
and
gentle
lion
having
yawned
threw
out
some
half
yard
of
tongue
wherewith
he
licked
and
washed
his
face
harriet
begins
to
laugh
there
i
say
triumphantly
harriet
looks
at
me
accusingly
such
foolishness
she
says
why
should
any
man
in
his
senses
try
to
fight
caged
lions
harriet
i
say
you
are
incorrigible
she
does
not
deign
to
reply
so
i
return
with
meekness
to
my
room
the
most
distressing
thing
about
the
ordinary
fact
writer
is
his
why
here
is
a
man
i
have
not
yet
dropped
him
out
of
the
window
who
has
written
a
large
and
sober
book
explaining
life
and
do
you
know
when
he
gets
through
he
is
apparently
much
discouraged
about
this
universe
this
is
the
veritable
moment
when
i
am
in
love
with
my
occupation
as
a
despot
at
this
moment
i
will
exercise
the
prerogative
of
tyranny
off
with
his
head
i
do
not
believe
this
person
though
he
have
ever
so
many
titles
to
jingle
after
his
name
nor
in
the
colleges
which
gave
them
if
they
stand
sponsor
for
that
which
he
writes
i
do
not
believe
he
has
compassed
this
universe
i
believe
him
to
be
an
inconsequent
being
like
myself
oh
much
more
learned
of
course
and
yet
only
upon
the
threshold
of
these
wonders
it
goes
too
deep
life
to
be
solved
by
fifty
years
of
living
there
is
far
too
much
in
the
blue
firmament
too
many
stars
to
be
dissolved
in
the
feeble
logic
of
a
single
brain
we
are
not
yet
great
enough
even
this
explanatory
person
to
grasp
the
scheme
of
things
entire
this
is
no
place
for
weak
pessimism
this
universe
this
is
mystery
and
out
of
mystery
springs
the
fine
adventure
what
we
have
seen
or
felt
what
we
think
we
know
are
insignificant
compared
with
that
which
may
be
known
what
this
person
explains
is
not
after
all
the
universe
but
himself
his
own
limited
faithless
personality
i
shall
not
accept
his
explanation
i
escape
him
utterly
not
long
ago
coming
in
from
my
fields
i
fell
to
thinking
of
the
supreme
wonder
of
a
tree
and
as
i
walked
i
met
the
professor
how
i
asked
does
the
sap
get
up
to
the
top
of
these
great
maples
and
elms
what
power
is
there
that
should
draw
it
upward
against
the
force
of
gravity
he
looked
at
me
a
moment
with
his
peculiar
slow
smile
i
do
know
he
said
what
i
exclaimed
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
science
has
not
solved
this
simplest
of
natural
phenomena
we
do
not
know
he
said
we
explain
but
we
do
not
know
no
my
explanatory
friend
we
do
not
know
we
do
not
know
the
why
of
the
flowers
or
the
trees
or
the
suns
we
do
not
even
know
why
in
our
own
hearts
we
should
be
asking
this
curious
question
and
other
deeper
questions
no
man
becomes
a
great
writer
unless
he
possesses
a
highly
developed
sense
of
mystery
of
wonder
a
great
writer
is
never
everything
to
him
happened
not
longer
ago
than
this
forenoon
the
other
night
the
professor
and
the
scotch
preacher
happened
in
here
together
and
we
fell
to
discussing
i
hardly
know
how
for
we
usually
talk
the
neighbourhood
chat
of
the
starkweathers
of
horace
and
of
charles
baxter
we
fell
to
discussing
old
izaak
walton
and
the
nonsense
as
a
scientific
age
knows
it
to
be
which
he
sometimes
talked
with
such
delightful
sobriety
how
superior
it
makes
one
feel
in
behalf
of
the
enlightenment
and
progress
of
his
age
said
the
professor
when
he
reads
extraordinary
natural
history
does
it
make
you
feel
that
way
asked
the
scotch
preacher
it
makes
me
want
to
go
fishing
and
he
took
the
old
book
and
turned
the
leaves
until
he
came
to
page
let
me
read
you
he
said
what
the
old
fellow
says
about
the
of
fishes
get
secretly
behind
a
tree
and
stand
as
free
from
motion
as
possible
then
put
a
grasshopper
on
your
hook
and
let
your
hook
hang
a
quarter
of
a
yard
short
of
the
water
to
which
end
you
must
rest
your
rod
on
some
bough
of
a
tree
but
it
is
likely
that
the
chubs
will
sink
down
towards
the
bottom
of
the
water
at
the
first
shadow
of
your
rod
for
a
chub
is
the
fearfulest
of
fishes
and
will
do
so
if
but
a
bird
flies
over
him
and
makes
the
least
shadow
on
the
water
but
they
will
presently
rise
up
to
the
top
again
and
there
lie
soaring
until
some
shadow
affrights
them
again
i
say
when
they
lie
upon
the
top
of
the
water
look
at
the
best
chub
which
you
getting
yourself
in
a
fit
place
may
very
easily
see
and
move
your
rod
as
slowly
as
a
snail
moves
to
that
chub
you
intend
to
catch
let
your
bait
fall
gently
upon
the
water
three
or
four
inches
before
him
and
he
will
infallibly
take
the
bait
and
you
will
be
as
sure
to
catch
him
go
your
way
presently
take
my
rod
and
do
as
i
bid
you
and
i
will
sit
down
and
mend
my
tackling
till
you
return
back
now
i
say
said
the
scotch
preacher
that
it
makes
me
want
to
go
fishing
that
i
said
is
true
of
every
great
book
it
either
makes
us
want
to
do
things
to
go
fishing
or
fight
harder
or
endure
more
patiently
or
it
takes
us
out
of
ourselves
and
beguiles
us
for
a
time
with
the
friendship
of
completer
lives
than
our
own
the
great
books
indeed
have
in
them
the
burning
fire
of
life
nay
they
do
preserve
as
in
a
violl
the
purest
efficacie
and
extraction
of
that
living
intellect
that
bred
them
i
know
they
are
as
lively
and
as
vigorously
productive
as
those
fabulous
dragon
teeth
which
being
sown
up
and
down
may
chance
to
spring
up
armed
men
how
soon
we
come
to
distinguish
the
books
of
the
mere
writers
from
the
books
of
real
men
for
true
literature
like
happiness
is
ever
a
it
is
the
expression
of
a
man
greatly
engaged
in
some
other
undertaking
it
is
the
song
of
one
working
there
is
something
inevitable
unrestrainable
about
the
great
books
they
seemed
to
come
despite
the
author
i
could
not
sleep
says
the
poet
horace
for
the
pressure
of
unwritten
poetry
dante
said
of
his
books
that
they
made
him
lean
for
many
days
i
have
heard
people
say
of
a
writer
in
explanation
of
his
success
oh
well
he
has
the
literary
knack
it
is
not
so
nothing
is
further
from
the
truth
he
writes
well
not
chiefly
because
he
is
interested
in
writing
or
because
he
possesses
any
especial
knack
but
because
he
is
more
profoundly
vividly
interested
in
the
activities
of
life
and
he
tells
about
them
over
his
shoulder
for
writing
like
farming
is
ever
a
tool
not
an
end
how
the
great
men
remain
with
us
i
can
see
marcus
aurelius
sitting
in
his
camps
among
the
far
barbarians
writing
out
the
reflections
of
a
busy
life
i
see
william
penn
engaged
in
great
undertakings
setting
down
some
of
the
fruits
of
solitude
and
abraham
lincoln
striking
in
the
hasty
paragraphs
written
for
his
speeches
one
of
the
highest
notes
in
our
american
literature
david
yes
harriet
i
am
going
up
now
it
is
very
late
yes
you
will
bank
the
fire
and
see
that
the
doors
are
locked
yes
after
a
pause
and
david
i
did
mean
about
the
story
you
read
did
the
knight
finally
kill
the
lions
no
i
said
with
sobriety
it
was
not
finally
necessary
but
i
thought
he
set
out
to
kill
them
he
did
but
he
proved
his
valour
without
doing
it
harriet
paused
made
as
if
to
speak
again
but
did
not
do
so
valour
i
began
in
my
hortatory
tone
seeing
a
fair
opening
but
at
the
look
in
her
eye
i
immediately
desisted
you
wo
stay
up
late
she
warned
i
said
take
john
bunyan
as
a
pattern
of
the
man
who
forgot
himself
into
immortality
how
seriously
he
wrote
sermons
and
pamphlets
now
happily
forgotten
but
it
was
not
until
he
was
shut
up
in
jail
some
writers
i
know
might
profit
by
his
example
that
he
put
aside
as
he
said
a
more
serious
and
important
work
and
wrote
pilgrim
progress
it
is
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
the
judgment
of
men
as
to
what
is
important
and
serious
bunyan
says
in
his
rhymed
introduction
i
only
thought
to
make
i
knew
not
what
nor
did
i
undertake
thereby
to
please
my
neighbour
no
not
i
i
did
it
my
own
self
to
gratify
another
man
i
love
to
have
at
hand
is
he
who
writes
of
blazing
bosville
the
flaming
tinman
and
of
the
hairy
ones
how
borrow
escapes
through
his
books
his
object
was
not
to
produce
literature
but
to
display
his
erudition
as
a
master
of
language
and
of
outlandish
custom
and
he
went
about
the
task
in
all
seriousness
of
demolishing
the
roman
catholic
church
we
are
not
now
so
impressed
with
his
erudition
that
we
do
not
smile
at
his
vanity
and
we
are
quite
contented
even
after
reading
his
books
to
let
the
church
survive
but
how
shall
we
spare
our
friend
with
his
inextinguishable
love
of
life
his
pugilists
his
gypsies
his
horse
traders
we
are
even
willing
to
plow
through
arid
deserts
of
dissertation
in
order
that
we
may
enjoy
the
perfect
oases
in
which
the
man
forgets
himself
reading
such
books
as
these
and
a
hundred
others
the
books
of
the
worn
case
at
my
elbow
the
bulged
and
the
bruised
octavos
the
dear
and
the
dumpy
twelves
i
become
like
those
initiated
in
the
eleusinian
mysteries
who
as
cicero
tells
us
have
attained
the
art
of
living
joyfully
and
of
dying
with
a
fairer
hope
it
is
late
and
the
house
is
still
a
few
bright
embers
glow
in
the
fireplace
you
look
up
and
around
you
as
though
coming
back
to
the
world
from
some
place
the
clock
in
the
ticks
with
solemn
precision
you
did
not
recall
that
it
had
so
loud
a
tone
it
has
been
a
great
evening
in
this
quiet
room
on
your
farm
you
have
been
able
to
entertain
the
worthies
of
all
the
past
you
walk
out
resoundingly
to
the
kitchen
and
open
the
door
you
look
across
the
still
white
fields
your
barn
looms
black
in
the
near
distance
the
white
mound
close
at
hand
is
your
the
great
trees
stand
like
sentinels
in
the
moonlight
snow
has
drifted
upon
the
doorstep
and
lies
there
untracked
it
is
indeed
a
dim
and
untracked
world
coldly
beautiful
but
silent
and
of
a
strange
unreality
you
close
the
door
with
half
a
shiver
and
take
the
real
world
with
you
up
to
bed
for
it
is
past
one
illustration
the
beauty
the
wonder
the
humour
the
tragedy
the
greatness
of
truth
xiii
the
politician
in
the
city
as
i
now
recall
it
having
escaped
it
seemed
to
be
the
instinctive
purpose
of
every
citizen
i
knew
not
to
get
into
politics
but
to
keep
out
we
sedulously
avoided
caucuses
and
our
time
was
far
too
precious
to
be
squandered
in
jury
service
we
forgot
to
register
for
elections
we
neglected
to
vote
we
observed
a
sort
of
aristocratic
contempt
for
political
activity
and
then
fretted
and
fumed
over
the
low
estate
to
which
our
government
had
fallen
and
never
saw
the
humour
of
it
all
at
one
time
i
experienced
a
sort
of
political
awakening
a
boss
we
had
was
more
than
ordinarily
piratical
i
think
he
had
a
scheme
to
steal
the
city
hall
and
sell
the
monuments
in
the
park
something
of
that
sort
and
i
for
one
was
disturbed
for
a
time
i
really
wanted
to
bear
a
man
part
in
helping
to
correct
the
abuses
only
i
did
not
know
how
and
could
not
find
out
in
the
city
when
one
would
learn
anything
about
public
matters
he
turns
not
to
life
but
to
books
or
newspapers
what
we
get
in
the
city
is
not
life
but
what
someone
else
tells
us
about
life
so
i
acquired
a
really
formidable
row
of
works
on
political
economy
and
government
i
admire
the
word
works
in
that
application
where
i
found
society
laid
out
for
me
in
the
most
perfect
order
with
pennies
on
its
eyes
how
often
looking
back
i
see
myself
as
in
those
days
read
my
learned
books
with
a
sort
of
fury
of
interest
from
the
reading
of
books
i
acquired
a
sham
comfort
dwelling
upon
the
excellent
theory
of
our
institutions
i
was
content
to
disregard
the
realities
of
daily
practice
i
acquired
a
mock
assurance
under
which
i
proceeded
complacently
to
the
polls
and
cast
my
vote
without
knowing
a
single
man
on
the
ticket
what
he
stood
for
or
what
he
really
intended
to
do
the
ceremony
of
the
ballot
bears
to
politics
much
the
relationship
that
the
sacrament
bears
to
religion
how
often
observing
the
formality
we
yet
depart
wholly
from
the
spirit
of
the
institution
it
was
good
to
escape
that
place
of
hurrying
strangers
it
was
good
to
get
one
feet
down
into
the
soil
it
was
good
to
be
in
a
place
where
things
because
they
and
politics
not
less
than
corn
oh
my
friend
say
what
you
please
argue
how
you
like
this
crowding
together
of
men
and
women
in
unnatural
surroundings
this
haste
to
be
rich
in
material
things
this
attempt
to
enjoy
without
production
this
removal
from
life
is
irrational
and
the
end
of
it
is
ruin
if
our
cities
were
not
recruited
constantly
with
the
fresh
clean
blood
of
the
country
with
boys
who
still
retain
some
of
the
power
and
the
vision
drawn
from
the
soil
where
would
they
be
we
a
great
people
says
charles
baxter
but
we
do
always
work
at
it
but
we
talk
about
it
says
the
scotch
preacher
by
the
way
says
charles
baxter
have
you
seen
george
warren
he
up
for
supervisor
i
have
yet
well
go
around
and
see
him
we
must
find
out
exactly
what
he
intends
to
do
with
the
summit
hill
road
if
he
is
weak
on
that
we
better
look
to
matt
devine
at
least
matt
is
safe
the
scotch
preacher
looked
at
charles
baxter
and
said
to
me
with
a
note
of
admiration
in
his
voice
is
this
man
baxter
getting
to
be
intolerable
as
a
political
boss
baxter
shop
baxter
shop
stands
close
to
the
road
and
just
in
the
edge
of
a
grassy
old
apple
orchard
it
is
a
low
unpainted
building
with
generous
double
doors
in
front
standing
irresistibly
open
as
you
go
by
even
as
a
stranger
coming
here
first
from
the
city
i
felt
the
call
of
baxter
shop
shall
i
ever
forget
it
was
a
still
morning
one
of
those
days
of
warm
sunshine
and
perfect
quiet
in
the
country
and
birds
in
the
branches
and
apple
trees
all
in
bloom
baxter
whistling
at
his
work
in
the
sunlit
doorway
of
his
shop
in
his
long
faded
apron
much
worn
at
the
knees
he
was
bending
to
the
rhythmic
movement
of
his
plane
and
all
around
him
as
he
worked
rose
billows
of
shavings
and
oh
the
odours
of
that
shop
the
fragrant
resinous
odour
of
pine
the
pungent
smell
of
black
walnut
the
dull
odour
of
oak
wood
how
they
stole
out
in
the
sunshine
waylaying
you
as
you
came
far
up
the
road
beguiling
you
as
you
passed
the
shop
and
stealing
reproachfully
after
you
as
you
went
onward
down
the
road
never
shall
i
forget
that
grateful
moment
when
i
first
passed
shop
a
failure
from
the
city
and
baxter
looking
out
at
me
from
his
deep
quiet
gray
eyes
eyes
that
were
almost
a
caress
my
wayward
feet
soon
took
me
unintroduced
within
the
doors
of
that
shop
the
first
of
many
visits
and
i
can
say
no
more
in
appreciation
of
my
ventures
there
than
that
i
came
out
always
with
more
than
i
had
when
i
went
in
the
wonders
there
the
long
bench
with
its
wooden
vises
and
the
little
dusty
windows
above
looking
out
into
the
orchard
and
the
brown
planes
and
the
row
of
shiny
saws
and
the
most
wonderful
pattern
squares
and
triangles
and
curves
each
hanging
on
its
own
peg
and
above
in
the
rafters
every
sort
and
size
of
curious
wood
and
oh
the
old
bureaus
and
whatnots
and
in
the
corners
waiting
their
turn
to
be
mended
and
the
sticky
waiting
too
on
the
end
of
the
sawhorse
there
is
family
history
here
in
this
shop
no
end
of
it
the
small
and
yet
great
because
intensely
human
tragedies
and
humours
of
the
long
quiet
years
among
these
sunny
hills
that
whatnot
there
the
one
of
black
walnut
with
the
top
knocked
off
that
belonged
in
the
old
days
to
charles
baxter
calls
my
friend
patterson
from
the
roadway
can
you
fix
my
cupboard
bring
it
in
says
charles
baxter
hospitably
and
patterson
brings
it
in
and
stops
to
talk
and
stops
and
stops
there
is
great
talk
in
baxter
shop
the
wisdom
of
the
country
the
lore
of
crops
and
calves
and
cabinets
in
baxter
shop
we
choose
the
next
president
of
these
united
states
you
laugh
but
we
do
exactly
that
it
is
in
the
baxters
shops
not
in
broadway
not
in
state
street
where
the
presidents
are
decided
upon
in
the
little
grocery
stores
you
and
i
know
in
the
blacksmithies
in
the
schoolhouses
back
in
the
country
forgive
me
i
did
not
intend
to
wander
away
i
meant
to
keep
to
my
subject
but
the
moment
i
began
to
talk
of
politics
in
the
country
i
was
beset
by
a
compelling
vision
of
charles
baxter
coming
out
of
his
shop
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
carrying
his
curious
old
reflector
lamp
and
leading
the
way
down
the
road
to
the
schoolhouse
and
thinking
of
the
lamp
brought
a
vision
of
the
joys
of
baxter
shop
and
thinking
of
the
shop
brought
me
naturally
around
to
politics
and
presidents
and
here
i
am
again
where
i
started
baxter
lamp
is
somehow
inextricably
associated
in
my
mind
with
politics
being
busy
farmers
we
hold
our
caucuses
and
other
meetings
in
the
evening
and
usually
in
the
schoolhouse
the
schoolhouse
is
conveniently
near
to
baxter
shop
so
we
gather
at
baxter
shop
baxter
takes
his
lamp
down
from
the
bracket
above
his
bench
reflector
and
all
and
you
will
see
us
a
row
of
dusky
figures
baxter
in
the
lead
proceeding
down
the
roadway
to
the
schoolhouse
having
arrived
some
one
scratches
a
match
shields
it
with
his
hand
i
see
yet
the
sudden
fitful
illumination
of
the
watchful
faces
of
my
neighbours
and
baxter
guides
us
into
the
schoolhouse
with
its
dusty
odours
of
chalk
and
varnished
desks
and
yes
leftover
lunches
baxter
lamp
stands
on
the
table
casting
a
vast
shadow
of
the
chairman
on
the
wall
come
to
order
says
the
chairman
and
we
have
here
at
this
moment
in
operation
the
greatest
institution
in
this
round
world
the
institution
of
free
great
in
its
simplicity
great
in
its
unselfishness
and
baxter
old
lamp
with
its
smoky
tin
reflector
is
not
that
the
veritable
torch
of
our
liberties
this
i
forgot
to
say
though
it
makes
no
special
difference
a
caucus
would
be
the
same
is
a
school
meeting
you
see
ours
is
a
prolific
community
when
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
are
married
they
think
about
babies
they
want
babies
and
what
is
more
they
have
them
and
love
them
afterward
it
is
a
part
of
the
complete
life
and
having
babies
there
must
be
a
place
to
teach
them
to
live
without
more
explanation
you
will
understand
that
we
needed
an
addition
to
our
schoolhouse
a
committee
reported
that
the
amount
required
would
be
we
talked
it
over
the
scotch
preacher
was
there
with
a
plan
which
he
tacked
up
on
the
blackboard
and
explained
to
us
he
told
us
of
seeing
the
and
the
carpenter
he
told
us
what
the
seats
would
cost
and
the
door
knobs
and
the
hooks
in
the
closet
we
are
a
careful
people
we
want
to
know
where
every
penny
goes
if
we
put
it
all
in
the
budget
this
year
what
will
that
make
the
rate
inquires
a
voice
from
the
end
of
the
room
we
do
look
around
we
know
the
voice
and
when
the
secretary
has
computed
the
rate
if
you
listen
closely
you
can
almost
hear
the
buzz
of
multiplications
and
additions
which
is
going
on
in
each
man
head
as
he
calculates
exactly
how
much
the
addition
will
mean
to
him
in
taxes
on
his
farm
his
daughter
piano
his
wife
and
many
a
man
is
saying
to
himself
if
we
build
this
addition
to
the
schoolhouse
i
shall
have
to
give
up
the
new
overcoat
i
have
counted
upon
or
amanda
wo
be
able
to
get
the
new
that
politics
the
voluntary
surrender
of
some
private
good
for
the
upbuilding
of
some
community
good
it
is
in
such
exercises
that
the
fibre
of
democracy
grows
sound
and
strong
there
is
after
all
in
this
world
no
real
good
for
which
we
do
not
have
to
surrender
something
in
the
city
the
average
voter
is
never
conscious
of
any
surrender
he
never
realises
that
he
is
giving
anything
himself
for
good
schools
or
good
streets
under
such
conditions
how
can
you
expect
no
service
no
reward
the
first
meeting
that
i
sat
through
watching
those
bronzed
farmers
at
work
gave
me
such
a
conception
of
the
true
meaning
of
as
i
never
hoped
to
have
this
is
the
place
where
i
belong
i
said
to
myself
it
was
wonderful
in
that
school
meeting
to
see
how
every
essential
element
of
our
government
was
brought
into
play
finance
we
discussed
whether
we
should
put
the
entire
into
the
next
year
budget
or
divide
it
paying
part
in
cash
and
bonding
the
district
for
the
remainder
the
question
of
credit
of
interest
of
the
obligations
of
this
generation
and
the
next
were
all
discussed
at
one
time
long
ago
i
was
amazed
when
i
heard
my
neighbours
arguing
in
baxter
shop
about
the
issuance
of
certain
bonds
by
the
united
states
government
how
completely
they
understood
it
i
know
now
where
they
got
that
understanding
right
in
the
school
meetings
and
town
caucuses
where
they
raise
money
yearly
for
the
expenses
of
our
small
government
there
is
nothing
like
it
in
the
city
the
progress
of
a
people
can
best
be
judged
by
those
things
which
they
accept
as
it
was
amazing
to
me
coming
from
the
city
and
before
i
understood
to
see
how
ingrained
had
become
some
of
the
principles
which
only
a
few
years
ago
were
problems
it
gave
me
a
new
pride
in
my
country
a
new
appreciation
of
the
steps
in
civilisation
which
we
have
already
permanently
gained
not
a
question
have
i
ever
heard
in
any
school
meeting
of
the
necessity
of
educating
every
american
child
at
any
cost
think
of
it
think
how
far
we
have
come
in
that
respect
in
seventy
yes
fifty
years
universal
education
has
become
a
settled
axiom
of
our
life
and
there
was
another
point
so
common
now
that
we
do
not
appreciate
the
significance
of
it
i
refer
to
majority
rule
in
our
school
meeting
we
were
voting
money
out
of
men
pockets
money
that
we
all
needed
for
private
expenses
and
yet
the
moment
the
minority
after
full
and
honest
discussion
failed
to
maintain
its
contention
in
opposition
to
the
new
building
it
yielded
with
perfect
good
humour
and
went
on
with
the
discussion
of
other
questions
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
in
the
light
of
history
is
not
that
a
wonderful
thing
one
of
the
chief
property
owners
in
our
neighbourhood
is
a
rather
crabbed
old
bachelor
having
no
children
and
heavy
taxes
to
pay
he
looks
with
jaundiced
eye
on
additions
to
schoolhouses
he
will
object
and
growl
and
growl
and
object
and
yet
pin
him
down
as
i
have
seen
the
scotch
preacher
pin
him
more
than
once
he
will
admit
that
children
of
course
he
will
say
certainly
of
course
must
be
educated
for
the
good
of
bachelors
as
well
as
other
people
the
scotch
preacher
will
press
it
home
certainly
of
course
and
when
the
final
issue
comes
after
full
discussion
after
he
has
tried
to
lop
off
a
few
yards
of
blackboard
or
order
cheaper
desks
or
dispense
with
the
he
votes
for
the
addition
with
the
rest
of
us
it
is
simply
amazing
to
see
how
much
grows
out
of
these
discussions
how
much
of
that
social
sympathy
and
understanding
which
is
the
very
of
democracy
it
cheaper
to
put
up
a
miserable
shack
of
an
addition
why
not
do
it
so
we
discuss
architecture
blindly
it
is
true
we
do
know
the
books
on
the
subject
but
we
grope
for
the
big
true
things
and
by
our
own
discussion
we
educate
ourselves
to
know
why
a
good
building
is
better
than
a
bad
one
heating
and
ventilation
in
their
relation
to
health
the
use
of
fad
studies
how
i
have
heard
those
things
discussed
how
north
who
has
now
left
us
forever
shone
in
those
meetings
and
charles
baxter
and
the
scotch
preacher
broad
men
every
one
how
they
have
explained
and
argued
with
what
patience
have
they
brought
into
that
small
schoolhouse
lighted
by
charles
baxter
lamp
the
grandest
conceptions
of
human
society
not
in
the
big
words
of
the
books
but
in
the
simple
concrete
language
of
our
common
life
why
teach
physiology
what
a
talk
north
once
gave
us
on
that
why
pay
a
teacher
a
month
when
one
can
be
had
for
you
should
have
heard
the
scotch
preacher
answer
that
question
many
a
one
of
us
went
away
with
some
of
the
education
which
we
had
come
somewhat
grudgingly
to
buy
for
our
children
these
are
our
political
bosses
these
unknown
patriots
who
preach
the
invisible
patriotism
which
expresses
itself
not
in
flags
and
oratory
but
in
the
quiet
daily
surrender
of
private
advantage
to
the
public
good
there
is
after
all
no
such
thing
as
perfect
equality
there
must
be
leaders
bosses
whatever
you
call
them
some
men
have
a
genius
for
leading
others
for
following
each
is
necessary
and
dependent
upon
the
other
in
cities
that
leadership
is
often
perverted
and
used
to
evil
ends
neither
leaders
nor
followers
seem
to
understand
in
its
essence
politics
is
merely
a
mode
of
expressing
human
sympathy
in
the
country
many
and
many
a
leader
like
baxter
works
faithfully
year
in
and
year
out
posting
notices
of
caucuses
school
meetings
and
elections
opening
cold
schoolhouses
talking
to
candidates
prodding
selfish
voters
and
mostly
without
reward
occasionally
they
are
elected
to
petty
offices
where
they
do
far
more
work
than
they
are
paid
for
we
have
our
eyes
on
often
they
are
rewarded
by
the
power
and
place
which
leadership
gives
them
among
their
neighbours
and
sometimes
and
that
is
charles
baxter
case
they
simply
like
it
baxter
is
of
the
social
temperament
it
is
the
natural
expression
of
his
personality
as
for
thinking
of
himself
as
a
patriot
he
would
never
dream
of
it
work
with
the
hands
close
touch
with
the
common
life
of
the
soil
has
given
him
much
of
the
true
wisdom
of
experience
he
knows
us
and
we
know
him
he
carries
the
banner
holds
it
as
high
as
he
knows
how
and
we
follow
whether
there
can
be
a
real
democracy
as
in
a
city
where
there
is
not
that
elbow
knowledge
that
close
neighbourhood
sympathy
that
conscious
surrender
of
little
personal
goods
for
bigger
public
ones
i
do
know
we
have
many
foreigners
in
our
district
but
all
three
were
there
on
the
night
we
voted
for
the
addition
they
are
polish
each
has
a
farm
where
the
whole
family
works
and
puts
on
a
little
more
americanism
each
year
they
good
people
it
is
surprising
how
much
all
these
poles
italians
germans
and
others
are
like
us
how
perfectly
human
they
are
when
we
know
them
personally
one
pole
here
named
kausky
i
have
come
to
know
pretty
well
and
i
declare
i
have
forgotten
that
he
a
pole
there
nothing
like
the
rub
of
democracy
the
reason
why
we
are
so
suspicious
of
the
foreigners
in
our
cities
is
that
they
are
crowded
together
in
such
vast
unknown
undigested
masses
we
have
swallowed
them
too
fast
and
we
suffer
from
a
sort
of
national
dyspepsia
here
in
the
country
we
promptly
digest
our
foreigners
and
they
make
as
good
americans
as
anybody
catch
a
foreigner
when
he
first
comes
here
says
charles
baxter
and
he
takes
to
our
politics
like
a
fish
to
water
the
scotch
preacher
says
they
gape
for
education
and
when
i
see
kausky
six
children
going
by
in
the
morning
to
school
all
their
round
sleepy
fat
faces
shining
with
soap
i
believe
it
baxter
tells
with
humour
how
he
persuaded
kausky
to
vote
for
the
addition
to
the
schoolhouse
it
was
a
pretty
stiff
tax
for
the
poor
fellow
to
pay
but
baxter
figgered
children
with
him
as
he
said
with
six
to
educate
baxter
showed
him
that
he
was
actually
getting
a
good
deal
more
than
he
paid
for
be
it
far
from
me
to
pretend
that
we
are
always
right
or
that
we
have
arrived
in
our
country
at
the
perfection
of
i
do
not
wish
to
imply
that
all
of
our
people
are
interested
that
all
attend
the
caucuses
and
some
of
the
most
prominent
never
come
near
they
stay
away
and
if
things
do
go
right
they
blame
charles
baxter
nor
must
i
the
seriousness
of
our
public
interest
but
we
certainly
have
here
if
anywhere
in
this
nation
real
growth
is
a
slow
process
we
often
fail
in
our
election
of
delegates
to
state
conventions
we
sometimes
vote
wrong
in
national
affairs
it
is
an
easy
thing
to
think
school
district
difficult
indeed
to
think
state
or
nation
but
we
grow
when
we
make
mistakes
it
is
not
because
we
are
evil
but
because
we
do
know
once
we
get
a
clear
understanding
of
the
right
or
wrong
of
any
question
you
can
depend
upon
us
absolutely
to
vote
for
what
is
right
with
more
education
we
shall
be
able
to
think
in
larger
and
larger
circles
until
we
become
finally
really
national
in
our
interests
and
sympathies
whenever
a
man
comes
along
who
knows
how
simple
we
are
and
how
much
we
really
want
to
do
right
if
we
can
be
convinced
that
a
thing
right
who
explains
how
the
railroad
question
for
example
affects
us
in
our
intimate
daily
lives
what
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
it
are
why
we
can
understand
and
do
understand
and
we
are
ready
to
act
it
is
easy
to
rally
to
a
flag
in
times
of
excitement
the
patriotism
of
drums
and
marching
regiments
is
cheap
blood
is
material
and
cheap
physical
weariness
and
hunger
are
cheap
but
the
struggle
i
speak
of
is
not
cheap
it
is
dramatised
by
few
symbols
it
deals
with
hidden
spiritual
qualities
within
the
conscience
of
men
its
heroes
are
yet
unsung
and
unhonoured
no
combats
in
all
the
world
history
were
ever
fought
so
high
upward
in
the
spiritual
air
as
these
and
surely
not
for
nothing
and
so
out
of
my
experience
both
in
city
and
country
i
feel
yes
i
that
the
real
motive
power
of
this
democracy
lies
back
in
the
little
country
neighbourhoods
like
ours
where
men
gather
in
dim
schoolhouses
and
practice
the
invisible
patriotism
of
surrender
and
service
xiv
the
harvest
oh
universe
what
thou
wishest
i
wish
i
come
to
the
end
of
these
adventures
with
a
regret
i
can
scarcely
express
i
at
least
have
enjoyed
them
i
began
setting
them
down
with
no
thought
of
publication
but
for
my
own
enjoyment
the
possibility
of
a
book
did
not
suggest
itself
until
afterwards
i
have
tried
to
relate
the
experiences
of
that
secret
elusive
invisible
life
which
in
every
man
is
so
far
more
real
so
far
more
important
than
his
visible
activities
the
real
expression
of
a
life
much
occupied
in
other
employment
when
i
first
came
to
this
farm
i
came
i
was
the
veritable
pattern
of
the
failure
i
believed
that
life
had
nothing
more
in
store
for
me
i
was
worn
out
physically
mentally
and
indeed
morally
i
had
diligently
planned
for
success
and
i
had
reaped
defeat
i
came
here
without
plans
i
plowed
and
harrowed
and
planted
expecting
nothing
in
due
time
i
began
to
reap
and
it
has
been
a
growing
marvel
to
me
the
diverse
and
unexpected
crops
that
i
have
produced
within
these
uneven
acres
of
earth
with
sweat
i
planted
corn
and
i
have
here
a
crop
not
only
of
corn
but
of
happiness
and
hope
my
tilled
fields
have
miraculously
sprung
up
to
friends
this
book
is
one
of
the
unexpected
products
of
my
farm
it
is
this
way
with
the
farmer
after
the
work
of
planting
and
cultivating
after
the
rain
has
fallen
in
his
fields
after
the
sun
has
warmed
them
after
the
new
green
leaves
have
broken
the
earth
one
day
he
stands
looking
out
with
a
certain
new
joy
across
his
acres
the
wind
bends
and
half
turns
the
long
blades
of
the
corn
and
there
springs
up
within
him
a
song
of
the
fields
no
matter
how
little
poetic
how
little
articulate
he
is
the
song
rises
irrepressibly
in
his
heart
and
he
turns
aside
from
his
task
with
a
new
glow
of
fulfillment
and
contentment
at
harvest
time
in
our
country
i
hear
or
i
imagine
i
hear
a
sort
of
chorus
rising
over
all
the
hills
and
i
meet
no
man
who
is
not
deep
down
within
him
a
singer
so
song
follows
work
so
art
grows
out
of
life
and
the
friends
i
have
made
they
have
come
to
me
naturally
as
the
corn
grows
in
my
fields
or
the
wind
blows
in
my
trees
some
strange
potency
abides
within
the
soil
of
this
earth
when
two
men
stoop
there
must
be
stooping
and
touch
it
together
a
magnetic
current
is
set
up
between
them
a
flow
of
common
understanding
and
confidence
i
would
call
the
attention
of
all
great
scientists
philosophers
and
theologians
to
this
phenomenon
it
will
repay
investigation
it
is
at
once
the
rarest
and
the
commonest
thing
i
know
it
shows
that
down
deep
within
us
where
we
really
live
we
are
all
a
good
deal
alike
we
have
much
the
same
instincts
hopes
joys
sorrows
if
only
it
were
not
for
the
outward
things
that
we
commonly
look
upon
as
important
which
are
in
reality
not
at
all
important
we
might
come
together
without
fear
vanity
envy
or
prejudice
and
be
friends
and
what
a
world
it
would
be
if
civilisation
means
anything
at
all
it
means
the
increasing
ability
of
men
to
look
through
material
possessions
through
clothing
through
differences
of
speech
and
colour
of
skin
and
to
see
the
genuine
man
that
abides
within
each
of
us
it
means
an
escape
from
symbols
i
tell
this
merely
to
show
what
surprising
and
unexpected
things
have
grown
out
of
my
farm
all
along
i
have
had
more
than
i
bargained
for
from
now
on
i
shall
marvel
at
nothing
when
i
ordered
my
own
life
i
failed
now
that
i
work
from
day
to
day
doing
that
which
i
can
do
best
and
which
most
delights
me
i
am
rewarded
in
ways
that
i
could
not
have
imagined
why
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
heaven
were
at
the
end
of
all
this
now
i
am
not
so
foolish
as
to
imagine
that
a
farm
is
a
perfect
place
in
these
adventures
i
have
emphasised
perhaps
too
forcibly
the
joyful
and
pleasant
features
of
my
life
in
what
i
have
written
i
have
naturally
chosen
only
those
things
which
were
most
interesting
and
charming
my
life
has
not
been
without
discouragement
and
loss
and
loneliness
loneliness
most
of
all
i
have
enjoyed
the
hard
work
the
little
troubles
have
troubled
me
more
than
the
big
ones
i
detest
unharnessing
a
muddy
horse
in
the
rain
i
do
like
chickens
in
the
barn
and
somehow
harriet
uses
an
inordinate
amount
of
kindling
wood
but
once
in
the
habit
unpleasant
things
have
a
way
of
fading
quickly
and
quietly
from
the
memory
and
you
see
after
living
so
many
years
in
the
city
the
worst
experience
on
the
farm
is
a
sort
of
joy
in
most
men
as
i
come
to
know
them
i
mean
men
who
dare
to
look
themselves
in
the
eye
i
find
a
deep
desire
for
more
naturalness
more
directness
how
weary
we
all
grow
of
this
fabric
of
deception
which
is
called
modern
life
how
passionately
we
desire
to
escape
but
can
not
see
the
way
how
our
hearts
beat
with
sympathy
when
we
find
a
man
who
has
turned
his
back
upon
it
all
and
who
says
i
will
live
it
no
longer
how
we
flounder
in
possessions
as
in
a
dark
and
suffocating
bog
wasting
our
energies
not
upon
life
but
upon
instead
of
employing
our
houses
our
cities
our
gold
our
clothing
we
let
these
inanimate
things
possess
and
employ
us
to
what
utter
weariness
blessed
be
nothing
sighs
a
dear
old
lady
of
my
knowledge
of
all
ways
of
escape
i
know
the
best
though
it
is
far
from
perfection
is
the
farm
there
a
man
may
yield
himself
most
nearly
to
the
quiet
and
orderly
processes
of
nature
he
may
attain
most
nearly
to
that
equilibrium
between
the
material
and
spiritual
with
time
for
the
exactions
of
the
first
and
leisure
for
the
growth
of
the
second
which
is
the
ideal
of
life
in
times
past
most
farming
regions
in
this
country
have
suffered
the
disadvantages
of
isolation
the
people
have
dwelt
far
distant
from
one
another
and
from
markets
they
have
had
little
to
stimulate
them
intellectually
or
socially
strong
and
peculiar
individuals
and
families
were
often
developed
at
the
expense
of
a
friendly
community
life
neighbourhood
feuds
were
common
country
life
was
marked
with
the
rigidity
of
a
hard
provincialism
all
this
however
is
rapidly
changing
the
closer
settlement
of
the
land
the
rural
delivery
of
mails
the
morning
newspaper
reaches
the
tin
box
at
the
end
of
my
lane
at
noon
the
farmer
telephone
the
spreading
country
trolleys
more
schools
and
churches
and
cheaper
railroad
rates
have
all
helped
to
bring
the
farmer
life
well
within
the
stimulating
currents
of
world
thought
without
robbing
it
of
its
ancient
advantages
and
those
advantages
are
incalculable
time
first
for
thought
and
reflection
narrow
streams
cut
deep
leading
to
the
growth
of
a
sturdy
freedom
of
action
which
is
indeed
a
natural
characteristic
of
the
man
who
has
his
feet
firmly
planted
upon
his
own
land
a
city
hammers
and
polishes
its
denizens
into
a
defined
model
it
worships
standardisation
but
the
country
encourages
differentiation
it
loves
new
types
thus
it
is
that
so
many
great
and
original
men
have
lived
their
youth
upon
the
land
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
abraham
lincoln
brought
up
in
a
street
of
tenements
family
life
on
the
farm
is
highly
educative
there
is
more
discipline
for
a
boy
in
the
continuous
care
of
a
cow
or
a
horse
than
in
many
a
term
of
school
industry
patience
perseverance
are
qualities
inherent
in
the
very
atmosphere
of
country
life
the
manual
training
of
city
schools
is
only
a
poor
makeshift
for
developing
in
the
city
boy
those
habits
which
the
country
boy
acquires
naturally
in
his
daily
life
an
honest
country
training
is
the
best
inheritance
a
father
can
leave
his
son
and
yet
a
farm
is
only
an
opportunity
a
tool
a
cornfield
a
plow
a
woodpile
an
oak
tree
will
cure
no
man
unless
he
have
it
in
himself
to
be
cured
the
truth
is
that
no
life
and
least
of
all
a
farmer
life
is
simple
unless
it
is
simple
i
know
a
man
and
his
wife
who
came
out
here
to
the
country
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
becoming
forthwith
simple
they
were
unable
to
keep
the
chickens
out
of
their
summer
kitchen
they
discovered
microbes
in
the
well
and
mosquitoes
in
the
cistern
and
wasps
in
the
garret
owing
to
the
resemblance
of
the
seeds
their
radishes
turned
out
to
be
turnips
the
last
i
heard
of
them
they
were
living
snugly
in
a
flat
in
sixteenth
street
all
their
troubles
solved
by
a
the
great
point
of
advantage
in
the
life
of
the
country
is
that
if
a
man
is
in
reality
simple
if
he
love
true
contentment
it
is
the
place
of
all
places
where
he
can
live
his
life
most
freely
and
fully
where
he
can
the
city
affords
no
such
opportunity
indeed
it
often
destroys
by
the
seductiveness
with
which
it
flaunts
its
carnal
graces
the
desire
for
the
higher
life
which
animates
every
good
man
while
on
the
subject
of
simplicity
it
may
be
well
to
observe
that
simplicity
does
not
necessarily
as
some
of
those
who
escape
from
the
city
seem
to
think
consist
in
doing
without
things
but
rather
in
the
proper
use
of
things
one
can
not
return
unless
with
affectation
to
the
crudities
of
a
former
existence
we
do
not
believe
in
diogenes
and
his
tub
do
you
not
think
the
good
lord
has
given
us
the
telephone
that
we
may
better
reach
that
of
brotherhood
which
is
the
highest
of
human
ideals
and
the
railroad
that
we
may
widen
our
human
knowledge
and
sympathy
and
even
the
though
indeed
i
have
sometimes
imagined
that
the
passing
this
way
had
a
different
origin
he
may
have
given
these
things
to
us
too
fast
faster
than
we
can
bear
but
is
that
any
reason
why
we
should
denounce
them
all
and
return
to
the
old
crude
ways
of
our
ancestors
i
am
no
reactionary
i
do
not
go
back
i
neglect
no
tool
of
progress
i
am
too
eager
to
know
every
wonder
in
this
universe
the
if
i
had
one
could
not
carry
me
fast
enough
i
must
yet
fly
after
my
experience
in
the
country
if
i
were
to
be
as
to
the
requisites
of
a
farm
i
should
say
that
the
chief
thing
to
be
desired
in
any
sort
of
agriculture
is
good
health
in
the
farmer
what
after
all
can
touch
that
how
many
of
our
joys
that
we
think
intellectual
are
purely
physical
this
joy
of
the
morning
that
the
poet
carols
about
so
cheerfully
is
often
nothing
more
than
the
exuberance
produced
by
a
good
hot
breakfast
going
out
of
my
kitchen
door
some
mornings
and
standing
for
a
moment
while
i
survey
the
green
and
spreading
fields
of
my
farm
it
seems
to
me
truly
as
if
all
nature
were
making
a
bow
to
me
it
seems
to
me
that
there
never
was
a
better
cow
than
mine
never
a
more
really
perfect
horse
and
as
for
pigs
could
any
in
this
world
herald
my
approach
with
more
cheerful
gruntings
and
squealings
but
there
are
other
requisites
for
a
farm
it
must
not
be
too
large
else
it
will
keep
you
away
from
your
friends
provide
a
town
not
too
far
off
and
yet
not
too
near
where
you
can
buy
your
flour
and
sell
your
grain
if
there
is
a
railroad
convenient
though
not
so
near
that
the
whistling
of
the
engines
reaches
you
that
is
an
added
advantage
demand
a
few
good
old
oak
trees
or
walnuts
or
even
elms
will
do
no
farm
should
be
without
trees
and
having
secured
the
oaks
buy
your
fuel
of
your
neighbours
thus
you
will
be
blessed
with
beauty
both
summer
and
winter
as
for
neighbours
accept
those
nearest
at
hand
you
will
find
them
surprisingly
human
like
yourself
if
you
like
them
you
will
be
surprised
to
find
how
much
they
all
like
you
and
will
upon
occasion
lend
you
a
harrow
or
a
butter
tub
or
help
you
with
your
plowing
but
if
you
hate
them
they
will
return
your
hatred
with
interest
i
have
discovered
that
those
who
travel
in
pursuit
of
better
neighbours
never
find
them
somewhere
on
every
farm
along
with
the
other
implements
there
should
be
a
row
of
good
books
which
should
not
be
allowed
to
rust
with
disuse
a
book
like
a
hoe
grows
brighter
with
employment
and
no
farm
even
in
this
country
where
we
enjoy
the
even
balance
of
the
seasons
rain
and
shine
shine
and
rain
should
be
devoid
of
that
irrigation
from
the
currents
of
the
world
thought
which
is
so
essential
to
the
complete
life
from
the
papers
which
the
postman
puts
in
the
box
flow
the
true
waters
of
civilisation
you
will
find
within
their
columns
how
to
be
good
or
how
to
make
pies
you
will
get
out
of
them
what
you
look
for
and
finally
down
the
road
from
your
farm
so
that
you
can
hear
the
bell
on
sunday
mornings
there
should
be
a
little
church
it
will
do
you
good
even
though
like
me
you
do
not
often
attend
it
a
sort
of
ark
of
the
covenant
and
when
you
get
to
it
you
will
find
therein
the
true
spirit
if
you
take
it
with
you
when
you
leave
home
of
course
you
will
look
for
good
land
and
comfortable
buildings
when
you
buy
your
farm
they
are
indeed
prime
requisites
i
have
put
them
last
for
the
reason
that
they
are
so
often
first
i
have
observed
however
that
the
joy
of
the
farmer
is
by
no
means
in
proportion
to
the
area
of
his
arable
land
it
is
often
a
nice
matter
to
decide
between
acres
and
contentment
men
perish
from
too
much
as
well
as
from
too
little
and
if
it
be
possible
there
should
be
a
long
table
in
the
and
little
chairs
around
it
and
small
beds
upstairs
and
young
voices
calling
at
their
play
in
the
fields
if
it
be
possible
sometimes
i
say
to
myself
i
have
grasped
happiness
here
it
is
i
have
it
and
yet
it
always
seems
at
that
moment
of
complete
fulfillment
as
though
my
hand
trembled
that
i
might
not
take
it
i
wonder
if
you
recall
the
story
of
christian
and
hopeful
how
standing
on
the
hill
clear
as
we
do
sometimes
at
our
best
they
looked
for
the
gates
of
the
celestial
city
as
we
look
how
fondly
then
they
essayed
to
look
but
the
remembrance
of
that
last
thing
that
the
shepherds
had
showed
them
made
their
hands
shake
by
means
of
which
impediment
they
could
not
look
steadily
through
the
glass
yet
they
thought
they
saw
something
like
the
gate
and
also
some
of
the
glory
of
the
place
how
often
i
have
thought
that
i
saw
some
of
the
glory
of
the
place
looking
from
the
hill
clear
and
how
often
lifting
the
glass
my
hand
has
trembled
