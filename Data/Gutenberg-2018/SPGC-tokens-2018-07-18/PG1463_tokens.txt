the
private
papers
of
henry
ryecroft
preface
the
name
of
henry
ryecroft
never
became
familiar
to
what
is
called
the
reading
public
a
year
ago
obituary
paragraphs
in
the
literary
papers
gave
such
account
of
him
as
was
thought
needful
the
date
and
place
of
his
birth
the
names
of
certain
books
he
had
written
an
allusion
to
his
work
in
the
periodicals
the
manner
of
his
death
at
the
time
it
sufficed
even
those
few
who
knew
the
man
and
in
a
measure
understood
him
must
have
felt
that
his
name
called
for
no
further
celebration
like
other
mortals
he
had
lived
and
laboured
like
other
mortals
he
had
entered
into
his
rest
to
me
however
fell
the
duty
of
examining
ryecroft
papers
and
having
in
the
exercise
of
my
discretion
decided
to
print
this
little
volume
i
feel
that
it
requires
a
word
or
two
of
biographical
complement
just
so
much
personal
detail
as
may
point
the
significance
of
the
here
made
when
first
i
knew
him
ryecroft
had
reached
his
fortieth
year
for
twenty
years
he
had
lived
by
the
pen
he
was
a
struggling
man
beset
by
poverty
and
other
circumstances
very
unpropitious
to
mental
work
many
forms
of
literature
had
he
tried
in
none
had
he
been
conspicuously
successful
yet
now
and
then
he
had
managed
to
earn
a
little
more
money
than
his
actual
needs
demanded
and
thus
was
enabled
to
see
something
of
foreign
countries
naturally
a
man
of
independent
and
rather
scornful
outlook
he
had
suffered
much
from
defeated
ambition
from
disillusions
of
many
kinds
from
subjection
to
grim
necessity
the
result
of
it
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
was
certainly
not
a
broken
spirit
but
a
mind
and
temper
so
sternly
disciplined
that
in
ordinary
intercourse
with
him
one
did
not
know
but
that
he
led
a
calm
contented
life
only
after
several
years
of
friendship
was
i
able
to
form
a
just
idea
of
what
the
man
had
gone
through
or
of
his
actual
existence
little
by
little
ryecroft
had
subdued
himself
to
a
modestly
industrious
routine
he
did
a
great
deal
of
mere
he
reviewed
he
translated
he
wrote
articles
at
long
intervals
a
volume
appeared
under
his
name
there
were
times
i
have
no
doubt
when
bitterness
took
hold
upon
him
not
seldom
he
suffered
in
health
and
probably
as
much
from
moral
as
from
physical
strain
but
on
the
whole
he
earned
his
living
very
much
as
other
men
do
taking
the
day
toil
as
a
matter
of
course
and
rarely
grumbling
over
it
time
went
on
things
happened
but
ryecroft
was
still
laborious
and
poor
in
moments
of
depression
he
spoke
of
his
declining
energies
and
evidently
suffered
under
a
haunting
fear
of
the
future
the
thought
of
dependence
had
always
been
intolerable
to
him
perhaps
the
only
boast
i
at
any
time
heard
from
his
lips
was
that
he
had
never
incurred
debt
it
was
a
bitter
thought
that
after
so
long
and
hard
a
struggle
with
unkindly
circumstance
he
might
end
his
life
as
one
of
the
defeated
a
happier
lot
was
in
store
for
him
at
the
age
of
fifty
just
when
his
health
had
begun
to
fail
and
his
energies
to
show
abatement
ryecroft
had
the
rare
good
fortune
to
find
himself
suddenly
released
from
toil
and
to
enter
upon
a
period
of
such
tranquillity
of
mind
and
condition
as
he
had
never
dared
to
hope
on
the
death
of
an
acquaintance
more
his
friend
than
he
imagined
the
wayworn
man
of
letters
learnt
with
astonishment
that
there
was
bequeathed
to
him
a
life
annuity
of
three
hundred
pounds
having
only
himself
to
support
he
had
been
a
widower
for
several
years
and
his
daughter
an
only
child
was
married
ryecroft
saw
in
this
income
something
more
than
a
competency
in
a
few
weeks
he
quitted
the
london
suburb
where
of
late
he
had
been
living
and
turning
to
the
part
of
england
which
he
loved
best
he
presently
established
himself
in
a
cottage
near
exeter
where
with
a
rustic
housekeeper
to
look
after
him
he
was
soon
thoroughly
at
home
now
and
then
some
friend
went
down
into
devon
to
see
him
those
who
had
that
pleasure
will
not
forget
the
plain
little
house
amid
its
garden
the
cosy
with
its
fine
view
across
the
valley
of
the
exe
to
haldon
the
host
cordial
gleeful
hospitality
rambles
with
him
in
lanes
and
meadows
long
talks
amid
the
stillness
of
the
rural
night
we
hoped
it
would
all
last
for
many
a
year
it
seemed
indeed
as
though
ryecroft
had
only
need
of
rest
and
calm
to
become
a
hale
man
but
already
though
he
did
not
know
it
he
was
suffering
from
a
disease
of
the
heart
which
cut
short
his
life
after
little
more
than
a
lustrum
of
quiet
contentment
it
had
always
been
his
wish
to
die
suddenly
he
dreaded
the
thought
of
illness
chiefly
because
of
the
trouble
it
gave
to
others
on
a
summer
evening
after
a
long
walk
in
very
hot
weather
he
lay
down
upon
the
sofa
in
his
study
and
there
as
his
calm
face
declared
passed
from
slumber
into
the
great
silence
when
he
left
london
ryecroft
bade
farewell
to
authorship
he
told
me
that
he
hoped
never
to
write
another
line
for
publication
but
among
the
papers
which
i
looked
through
after
his
death
i
came
upon
three
manuscript
books
which
at
first
glance
seemed
to
be
a
diary
a
date
on
the
opening
page
of
one
of
them
showed
that
it
had
been
begun
not
very
long
after
the
writer
settling
in
devon
when
i
had
read
a
little
in
these
pages
i
saw
that
they
were
no
mere
record
of
life
evidently
finding
himself
unable
to
forego
altogether
the
use
of
the
pen
the
veteran
had
set
down
as
humour
bade
him
a
thought
a
reminiscence
a
bit
of
reverie
a
description
of
his
state
of
mind
and
so
on
dating
such
passage
merely
with
the
month
in
which
it
was
written
sitting
in
the
room
where
i
had
often
been
his
companion
i
turned
page
after
page
and
at
moments
it
was
as
though
my
friend
voice
sounded
to
me
once
more
i
saw
his
worn
visage
grave
or
smiling
recalled
his
familiar
pose
or
gesture
but
in
this
written
gossip
he
revealed
himself
more
intimately
than
in
our
conversation
of
the
days
gone
by
ryecroft
had
never
erred
by
lack
of
reticence
as
was
natural
in
a
sensitive
man
who
had
suffered
much
he
inclined
to
gentle
acquiescence
shrank
from
argument
from
here
he
spoke
to
me
without
restraint
and
when
i
had
read
it
all
through
i
knew
the
man
better
than
before
assuredly
this
writing
was
not
intended
for
the
public
and
yet
in
many
a
passage
i
seemed
to
perceive
the
literary
purpose
something
more
than
the
turn
of
phrase
and
so
on
which
results
from
long
habit
of
composition
certain
of
his
reminiscences
in
particular
ryecroft
could
hardly
have
troubled
to
write
down
had
he
not
however
vaguely
entertained
the
thought
of
putting
them
to
some
use
i
suspect
that
in
his
happy
leisure
there
grew
upon
him
a
desire
to
write
one
more
book
a
book
which
should
be
written
merely
for
his
own
satisfaction
plainly
it
would
have
been
the
best
he
had
it
in
him
to
do
but
he
seems
never
to
have
attempted
the
arrangement
of
these
fragmentary
pieces
and
probably
because
he
could
not
decide
upon
the
form
they
should
take
i
imagine
him
shrinking
from
the
thought
of
a
volume
he
would
feel
it
too
pretentious
he
would
bid
himself
wait
for
the
day
of
riper
wisdom
and
so
the
pen
fell
from
his
hand
conjecturing
thus
i
wondered
whether
the
irregular
diary
might
not
have
wider
interest
than
at
first
appeared
to
me
its
personal
appeal
was
very
strong
might
it
not
be
possible
to
cull
from
it
the
substance
of
a
small
volume
which
at
least
for
its
sincerity
sake
would
not
be
without
value
for
those
who
read
not
with
the
eye
alone
but
with
the
mind
i
turned
the
pages
again
here
was
a
man
who
having
his
desire
and
that
a
very
modest
one
not
only
felt
satisfied
but
enjoyed
great
happiness
he
talked
of
many
different
things
saying
exactly
what
he
thought
he
spoke
of
himself
and
told
the
truth
as
far
as
mortal
can
tell
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
thing
had
human
interest
i
decided
to
print
the
question
of
arrangement
had
to
be
considered
i
did
not
like
to
offer
a
mere
incondite
miscellany
to
supply
each
of
the
disconnected
passages
with
a
title
or
even
to
group
them
under
subject
headings
would
have
interfered
with
the
spontaneity
which
above
all
i
wished
to
preserve
in
reading
through
the
matter
i
had
selected
it
struck
me
how
often
the
aspects
of
nature
were
referred
to
and
how
suitable
many
of
the
reflections
were
to
the
month
with
which
they
were
dated
ryecroft
i
knew
had
ever
been
much
influenced
by
the
mood
of
the
sky
and
by
the
procession
of
the
year
so
i
hit
upon
the
thought
of
dividing
the
little
book
into
four
chapters
named
after
the
seasons
like
all
classifications
it
is
imperfect
but
serve
spring
i
for
more
than
a
week
my
pen
has
lain
untouched
i
have
written
nothing
for
seven
whole
days
not
even
a
letter
except
during
one
or
two
bouts
of
illness
such
a
thing
never
happened
in
my
life
before
in
my
life
the
life
that
is
which
had
to
be
supported
by
anxious
toil
the
life
which
was
not
lived
for
living
sake
as
all
life
should
be
but
under
the
goad
of
fear
the
earning
of
money
should
be
a
means
to
an
end
for
more
than
thirty
years
i
began
to
support
myself
at
sixteen
i
had
to
regard
it
as
the
end
itself
i
could
imagine
that
my
old
penholder
feels
reproachfully
towards
me
has
it
not
served
me
well
why
do
i
in
my
happiness
let
it
lie
there
neglected
gathering
dust
the
same
penholder
that
has
lain
against
my
forefinger
day
after
day
for
how
many
years
twenty
at
least
i
remember
buying
it
at
a
shop
in
tottenham
court
road
by
the
same
token
i
bought
that
day
a
which
cost
me
a
whole
shilling
an
extravagance
which
made
me
tremble
the
penholder
shone
with
its
new
varnish
now
it
is
plain
brown
wood
from
end
to
end
on
my
forefinger
it
has
made
a
callosity
old
companion
yet
old
enemy
how
many
a
time
have
i
taken
it
up
loathing
the
necessity
heavy
in
head
and
heart
my
hand
shaking
my
eyes
how
i
dreaded
the
white
page
i
had
to
foul
with
ink
above
all
on
days
such
as
this
when
the
blue
eyes
of
spring
laughed
from
between
rosy
clouds
when
the
sunlight
shimmered
upon
my
table
and
made
me
long
long
all
but
to
madness
for
the
scent
of
the
flowering
earth
for
the
green
of
hillside
larches
for
the
singing
of
the
skylark
above
the
downs
there
was
a
time
it
seems
further
away
than
childhood
when
i
took
up
my
pen
with
eagerness
if
my
hand
trembled
it
was
with
hope
but
a
hope
that
fooled
me
for
never
a
page
of
my
writing
deserved
to
live
i
can
say
that
now
without
bitterness
it
was
youthful
error
and
only
the
force
of
circumstance
prolonged
it
the
world
has
done
me
no
injustice
thank
heaven
i
have
grown
wise
enough
not
to
rail
at
it
for
this
and
why
should
any
man
who
writes
even
if
he
write
things
immortal
nurse
anger
at
the
world
neglect
who
asked
him
to
publish
who
promised
him
a
hearing
who
has
broken
faith
with
him
if
my
shoemaker
turn
me
out
an
excellent
pair
of
boots
and
i
in
some
mood
of
cantankerous
unreason
throw
them
back
upon
his
hands
the
man
has
just
cause
of
complaint
but
your
poem
your
novel
who
bargained
with
you
for
it
if
it
is
honest
journeywork
yet
lacks
purchasers
at
most
you
may
call
yourself
a
hapless
tradesman
if
it
come
from
on
high
with
what
decency
do
you
fret
and
fume
because
it
is
not
paid
for
in
heavy
cash
for
the
work
of
man
mind
there
is
one
test
and
one
alone
the
judgment
of
generations
yet
unborn
if
you
have
written
a
great
book
the
world
to
come
will
know
of
it
but
you
do
care
for
posthumous
glory
you
want
to
enjoy
fame
in
a
comfortable
armchair
ah
that
is
quite
another
thing
have
the
courage
of
your
desire
admit
yourself
a
merchant
and
protest
to
gods
and
men
that
the
merchandise
you
offer
is
of
better
quality
than
much
which
sells
for
a
high
price
you
may
be
right
and
indeed
it
is
hard
upon
you
that
fashion
does
not
turn
to
your
stall
ii
the
exquisite
quiet
of
this
room
i
have
been
sitting
in
utter
idleness
watching
the
sky
viewing
the
shape
of
golden
sunlight
upon
the
carpet
which
changes
as
the
minutes
pass
letting
my
eye
wander
from
one
framed
print
to
another
and
along
the
ranks
of
my
beloved
books
within
the
house
nothing
stirs
in
the
garden
i
can
hear
singing
of
birds
i
can
hear
the
rustle
of
their
wings
and
thus
if
it
please
me
i
may
sit
all
day
long
and
into
the
profounder
quiet
of
the
night
my
house
is
perfect
by
great
good
fortune
i
have
found
a
housekeeper
no
less
to
my
mind
a
woman
of
discreet
age
strong
and
deft
enough
to
render
me
all
the
service
i
require
and
not
afraid
of
solitude
she
rises
very
early
by
my
there
remains
little
to
be
done
under
the
roof
save
dressing
of
meals
very
rarely
do
i
hear
even
a
clink
of
crockery
never
the
closing
of
a
door
or
window
oh
blessed
silence
there
is
not
the
remotest
possibility
of
any
one
calling
upon
me
and
that
i
should
call
upon
any
one
else
is
a
thing
undreamt
of
i
owe
a
letter
to
a
friend
perhaps
i
shall
write
it
before
bedtime
perhaps
i
shall
leave
it
till
morning
a
letter
of
friendship
should
never
be
written
save
when
the
spirit
prompts
i
have
not
yet
looked
at
the
newspaper
generally
i
leave
it
till
i
come
back
tired
from
my
walk
it
amuses
me
then
to
see
what
the
noisy
world
is
doing
what
new
torments
men
have
discovered
what
new
forms
of
vain
toil
what
new
occasions
of
peril
and
of
strife
i
grudge
to
give
the
first
freshness
of
the
morning
mind
to
things
so
sad
and
foolish
my
house
is
perfect
just
large
enough
to
allow
the
grace
of
order
in
domestic
circumstance
just
that
superfluity
of
intramural
space
to
lack
which
is
to
be
less
than
at
one
ease
the
fabric
is
sound
the
work
in
wood
and
plaster
tells
of
a
more
leisurely
and
a
more
honest
age
than
ours
the
stairs
do
not
creak
under
my
step
i
am
waylaid
by
no
unkindly
draught
i
can
open
or
close
a
window
without
as
to
such
trifles
as
the
tint
and
device
of
i
confess
my
indifference
be
the
walls
only
unobtrusive
and
i
am
satisfied
the
first
thing
in
one
home
is
comfort
let
beauty
of
detail
be
added
if
one
has
the
means
the
patience
the
eye
to
me
this
little
is
beautiful
and
chiefly
because
it
is
home
through
the
greater
part
of
life
i
was
homeless
many
places
have
i
inhabited
some
which
my
soul
loathed
and
some
which
pleased
me
well
but
never
till
now
with
that
sense
of
security
which
makes
a
home
at
any
moment
i
might
have
been
driven
forth
by
evil
hap
by
nagging
necessity
for
all
that
time
did
i
say
within
myself
some
day
perchance
i
shall
have
a
home
yet
the
perchance
had
more
and
more
of
emphasis
as
life
went
on
and
at
the
moment
when
fate
was
secretly
smiling
on
me
i
had
all
but
abandoned
hope
i
have
my
home
at
last
when
i
place
a
new
volume
on
my
shelves
i
say
stand
there
whilst
i
have
eyes
to
see
you
and
a
joyous
tremor
thrills
me
this
house
is
mine
on
a
lease
of
a
score
of
years
so
long
i
certainly
shall
not
live
but
if
i
did
even
so
long
should
i
have
the
wherewithal
to
pay
my
rent
and
buy
my
food
i
think
with
compassion
of
the
unhappy
mortals
for
whom
no
such
sun
will
ever
rise
i
should
like
to
add
to
the
litany
a
new
petition
for
all
inhabitants
of
great
towns
and
especially
for
all
such
as
dwell
in
lodgings
flats
or
any
other
sordid
substitute
for
home
which
need
or
foolishness
may
have
contrived
in
vain
i
have
pondered
the
stoic
virtues
i
know
that
it
is
folly
to
fret
about
the
spot
of
one
abode
on
this
little
earth
all
places
that
the
eye
of
heaven
visits
are
to
the
wise
man
ports
and
happy
havens
but
i
have
always
worshipped
wisdom
afar
off
in
the
sonorous
period
of
the
philosopher
in
the
golden
measure
of
the
poet
i
find
it
of
all
things
lovely
to
its
possession
i
shall
never
attain
what
will
it
serve
me
to
pretend
a
virtue
of
which
i
am
incapable
to
me
the
place
and
manner
of
my
abode
is
of
supreme
import
let
it
be
confessed
and
there
an
end
of
it
i
am
no
cosmopolite
were
i
to
think
that
i
should
die
away
from
england
the
thought
would
be
dreadful
to
me
and
in
england
this
is
the
dwelling
of
my
choice
this
is
my
home
iii
i
am
no
botanist
but
i
have
long
found
pleasure
in
i
love
to
come
upon
a
plant
which
is
unknown
to
me
to
identify
it
with
the
help
of
my
book
to
greet
it
by
name
when
next
it
shines
beside
my
path
if
the
plant
be
rare
its
discovery
gives
me
joy
nature
the
great
artist
makes
her
common
flowers
in
the
common
view
no
word
in
human
language
can
express
the
marvel
and
the
loveliness
even
of
what
we
call
the
vulgarest
weed
but
these
are
fashioned
under
the
gaze
of
every
the
rare
flower
is
shaped
apart
in
places
secret
in
the
artist
subtler
mood
to
find
it
is
to
enjoy
the
sense
of
admission
to
a
holier
precinct
even
in
my
gladness
i
am
awed
i
have
walked
far
and
at
the
end
of
my
walk
i
found
the
little
it
grew
in
a
copse
of
young
ash
when
i
had
looked
long
at
the
flower
i
delighted
myself
with
the
grace
of
the
slim
trees
about
it
their
shining
smoothness
their
olive
hue
hard
by
stood
a
bush
of
wych
elm
its
tettered
bark
overlined
as
if
with
the
character
of
some
unknown
tongue
made
the
young
ashes
yet
more
beautiful
it
matters
not
how
long
i
wander
there
is
no
task
to
bring
me
back
no
one
will
be
vexed
or
uneasy
linger
i
ever
so
late
spring
is
shining
upon
these
lanes
and
meadows
i
feel
as
if
i
must
follow
every
winding
track
that
opens
by
my
way
spring
has
restored
to
me
something
of
the
vigour
of
youth
i
walk
without
weariness
i
sing
to
myself
like
a
boy
and
the
song
is
one
i
knew
in
boyhood
that
reminds
me
of
an
incident
near
a
hamlet
in
a
lonely
spot
by
a
woodside
i
came
upon
a
little
lad
of
perhaps
ten
years
old
who
his
head
hidden
in
his
arms
against
a
tree
trunk
was
crying
bitterly
i
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
and
after
a
little
trouble
he
was
better
than
a
mere
bumpkin
i
learnt
that
having
been
sent
with
sixpence
to
pay
a
debt
he
had
lost
the
money
the
poor
little
fellow
was
in
a
state
of
mind
which
in
a
grave
man
would
be
called
the
anguish
of
despair
he
must
have
been
crying
for
a
long
time
every
muscle
in
his
face
quivered
as
if
under
torture
his
limbs
shook
his
eyes
his
voice
uttered
such
misery
as
only
the
vilest
criminal
should
be
made
to
suffer
and
it
was
because
he
had
lost
sixpence
i
could
have
shed
tears
with
him
tears
of
pity
and
of
rage
at
all
this
spectacle
implied
on
a
day
of
indescribable
glory
when
earth
and
heaven
shed
benedictions
upon
the
soul
of
man
a
child
whose
nature
would
have
bidden
him
rejoice
as
only
childhood
may
wept
his
heart
out
because
his
hand
had
dropped
a
sixpenny
piece
the
loss
was
a
very
serious
one
and
he
knew
it
he
was
less
afraid
to
face
his
parents
than
overcome
by
misery
at
the
thought
of
the
harm
he
had
done
them
sixpence
dropped
by
the
wayside
and
a
whole
family
made
wretched
what
are
the
due
descriptive
terms
for
a
state
of
civilization
in
which
such
a
thing
as
this
is
possible
i
put
my
hand
into
my
pocket
and
wrought
sixpennyworth
of
miracle
it
took
me
half
an
hour
to
recover
my
quiet
mind
after
all
it
is
as
idle
to
rage
against
man
fatuity
as
to
hope
that
he
will
ever
be
less
a
fool
for
me
the
great
thing
was
my
sixpenny
miracle
why
i
have
known
the
day
when
it
would
have
been
beyond
my
power
altogether
or
else
would
have
cost
me
a
meal
wherefore
let
me
again
be
glad
and
thankful
iv
there
was
a
time
in
my
life
when
if
i
had
suddenly
been
set
in
the
position
i
now
enjoy
conscience
would
have
lain
in
ambush
for
me
what
an
income
sufficient
to
support
three
or
four
families
a
house
all
to
myself
things
beautiful
wherever
i
turn
and
absolutely
nothing
to
do
for
it
all
i
should
have
been
hard
put
to
it
to
defend
myself
in
those
days
i
was
feelingly
reminded
hour
by
hour
with
what
a
struggle
the
obscure
multitudes
manage
to
keep
alive
nobody
knows
better
than
i
do
parvo
liceat
producere
i
have
hungered
in
the
streets
i
have
laid
my
head
in
the
poorest
shelter
i
know
what
it
is
to
feel
the
heart
burn
with
wrath
and
envy
of
the
privileged
classes
yes
but
all
that
time
i
was
one
of
the
privileged
myself
and
now
i
can
accept
a
recognized
standing
among
them
without
shadow
of
it
does
not
mean
that
my
larger
sympathies
are
blunted
by
going
to
certain
places
looking
upon
certain
scenes
i
could
most
effectually
destroy
all
the
calm
that
life
has
brought
me
if
i
hold
apart
and
purposely
refuse
to
look
that
way
it
is
because
i
believe
that
the
world
is
better
not
worse
for
having
one
more
inhabitant
who
lives
as
becomes
a
civilized
being
let
him
whose
soul
prompts
him
to
assail
the
iniquity
of
things
cry
and
spare
not
let
him
who
has
the
vocation
go
forth
and
combat
in
me
it
would
be
to
err
from
nature
guidance
i
know
if
i
know
anything
that
i
am
made
for
the
life
of
tranquillity
and
meditation
i
know
that
only
thus
can
such
virtue
as
i
possess
find
scope
more
than
half
a
century
of
existence
has
taught
me
that
most
of
the
wrong
and
folly
which
darken
earth
is
due
to
those
who
can
not
possess
their
souls
in
quiet
that
most
of
the
good
which
saves
mankind
from
destruction
comes
of
life
that
is
led
in
thoughtful
stillness
every
day
the
world
grows
noisier
i
for
one
will
have
no
part
in
that
increasing
clamour
and
were
it
only
by
my
silence
i
confer
a
boon
on
all
how
well
would
the
revenues
of
a
country
be
expended
if
by
mere
pensioning
of
its
population
could
be
induced
to
live
as
i
do
sir
said
johnson
all
the
arguments
which
are
brought
to
represent
poverty
as
no
evil
show
it
to
be
evidently
a
great
evil
you
never
find
people
labouring
to
convince
you
that
you
may
live
very
happily
upon
a
plentiful
fortune
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
of
that
rugged
old
master
of
common
sense
poverty
is
of
course
a
relative
thing
the
term
has
reference
above
all
to
one
standing
as
an
intellectual
being
if
i
am
to
believe
the
newspapers
there
are
men
and
women
in
england
who
had
they
an
assured
income
of
shillings
per
week
would
have
no
right
to
call
themselves
poor
for
their
intellectual
needs
are
those
of
a
or
scullery
wench
give
me
the
same
income
and
i
can
live
but
i
am
poor
indeed
you
tell
me
that
money
can
not
buy
the
things
most
precious
your
commonplace
proves
that
you
have
never
known
the
lack
of
it
when
i
think
of
all
the
sorrow
and
the
barrenness
that
has
been
wrought
in
my
life
by
want
of
a
few
more
pounds
per
annum
than
i
was
able
to
earn
i
stand
aghast
at
money
significance
what
kindly
joys
have
i
lost
those
simple
forms
of
happiness
to
which
every
heart
has
claim
because
of
poverty
meetings
with
those
i
loved
made
impossible
year
after
year
sadness
misunderstanding
nay
cruel
alienation
arising
from
inability
to
do
the
things
i
wished
and
which
i
might
have
done
had
a
little
money
helped
me
endless
instances
of
homely
pleasure
and
contentment
curtailed
or
forbidden
by
narrow
means
i
have
lost
friends
merely
through
the
constraints
of
my
position
friends
i
might
have
made
have
remained
strangers
to
me
solitude
of
the
bitter
kind
the
solitude
which
is
enforced
at
times
when
mind
or
heart
longs
for
companionship
often
cursed
my
life
solely
because
i
was
poor
i
think
it
would
scarce
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
there
is
no
moral
good
which
has
not
to
be
paid
for
in
coin
of
the
realm
poverty
said
johnson
again
is
so
great
an
evil
and
pregnant
with
so
much
temptation
so
much
misery
that
i
can
not
but
earnestly
enjoin
you
to
avoid
it
for
my
own
part
i
needed
no
injunction
to
that
effort
of
avoidance
many
a
london
garret
knows
how
i
struggled
with
the
unwelcome
i
marvel
she
did
not
abide
with
me
to
the
end
it
is
a
sort
of
inconsequence
in
nature
and
sometimes
makes
me
vaguely
uneasy
through
nights
of
broken
sleep
vi
how
many
more
springs
can
i
hope
to
see
a
sanguine
temper
would
say
ten
or
twelve
let
me
dare
to
hope
humbly
for
five
or
six
that
is
a
great
many
five
or
six
welcomed
joyously
lovingly
watched
from
the
first
celandine
to
the
budding
of
the
rose
who
shall
dare
to
call
it
a
stinted
boon
five
or
six
times
the
miracle
of
earth
reclad
the
vision
of
splendour
and
loveliness
which
tongue
has
never
yet
described
set
before
my
gazing
to
think
of
it
is
to
fear
that
i
ask
too
much
vii
homo
animal
querulum
cupide
suis
incumbens
miseriis
i
wonder
where
that
comes
from
i
found
it
once
in
charron
quoted
without
reference
and
it
has
often
been
in
my
mind
a
dreary
truth
well
worded
at
least
it
was
a
truth
for
me
during
many
a
long
year
life
i
fancy
would
very
often
be
insupportable
but
for
the
luxury
of
in
cases
numberless
this
it
must
be
that
saves
from
suicide
for
some
there
is
great
relief
in
talking
about
their
miseries
but
such
gossips
lack
the
profound
solace
of
misery
nursed
in
silent
brooding
happily
the
trick
with
me
has
never
been
retrospective
indeed
it
was
never
even
with
regard
to
instant
suffering
a
habit
so
deeply
rooted
as
to
become
a
mastering
vice
i
knew
my
own
weakness
when
i
yielded
to
it
i
despised
myself
when
it
brought
me
comfort
i
could
laugh
scornfully
even
cupide
meis
incumbens
miseriis
and
now
thanks
be
to
the
unknown
power
which
rules
us
my
past
has
buried
its
dead
more
than
that
i
can
accept
with
sober
cheerfulness
the
necessity
of
all
i
lived
through
so
it
was
to
be
so
it
was
for
this
did
nature
shape
me
with
what
purpose
i
shall
never
know
but
in
the
sequence
of
things
eternal
this
was
my
place
could
i
have
achieved
so
much
philosophy
if
as
i
ever
feared
the
closing
years
of
my
life
had
passed
in
helpless
indigence
should
i
not
have
sunk
into
lowest
depths
of
querulous
grovelling
there
with
eyes
obstinately
averted
from
the
light
above
viii
the
early
coming
of
spring
in
this
happy
devon
gladdens
my
heart
i
think
with
chill
discomfort
of
those
parts
of
england
where
the
primrose
shivers
beneath
a
sky
of
threat
rather
than
of
solace
honest
winter
and
with
the
frosted
beard
i
can
welcome
not
uncordially
but
that
long
deferment
of
the
calendar
promise
that
weeping
gloom
of
march
and
april
that
bitter
blast
outraging
the
honour
of
may
how
often
has
it
robbed
me
of
heart
and
hope
here
scarce
have
i
assured
myself
that
the
last
leaf
has
fallen
scarce
have
i
watched
the
glistening
of
upon
the
evergreens
when
a
breath
from
the
west
thrills
me
with
anticipation
of
bud
and
bloom
even
under
this
sky
which
tells
that
february
is
still
in
rule
mild
winds
shake
the
elder
brake
and
the
wandering
herdsmen
know
that
the
whitethorn
soon
will
blow
i
have
been
thinking
of
those
early
years
of
mine
in
london
when
the
seasons
passed
over
me
unobserved
when
i
seldom
turned
a
glance
towards
the
heavens
and
felt
no
hardship
in
the
imprisonment
of
boundless
streets
it
is
strange
now
to
remember
that
for
some
six
or
seven
years
i
never
looked
upon
a
meadow
never
travelled
even
so
far
as
to
the
bordered
suburbs
i
was
battling
for
dear
life
on
most
days
i
could
not
feel
certain
that
in
a
week
time
i
should
have
food
and
shelter
it
would
happen
to
be
sure
that
in
hot
noons
of
august
my
thoughts
wandered
to
the
sea
but
so
impossible
was
the
gratification
of
such
desire
that
it
never
greatly
troubled
me
at
times
indeed
i
seem
all
but
to
have
forgotten
that
people
went
away
for
holiday
in
those
poor
parts
of
the
town
where
i
dwelt
season
made
no
perceptible
difference
there
were
no
cabs
to
remind
me
of
joyous
journeys
the
folk
about
me
went
daily
to
their
toil
as
usual
and
so
did
i
remember
afternoons
of
languor
when
books
were
a
weariness
and
no
thought
could
be
squeezed
out
of
the
drowsy
brain
then
would
i
betake
myself
to
one
of
the
parks
and
find
refreshment
without
any
enjoyable
sense
of
change
heavens
how
i
laboured
in
those
days
and
how
far
i
was
from
thinking
of
myself
as
a
subject
for
compassion
that
came
later
when
my
health
had
begun
to
suffer
from
excess
of
toil
from
bad
air
bad
food
and
many
miseries
then
awoke
the
maddening
desire
for
countryside
and
and
for
other
things
yet
more
remote
but
in
the
years
when
i
toiled
hardest
and
underwent
what
now
appear
to
me
hideous
privations
of
a
truth
i
could
not
be
said
to
suffer
at
all
i
did
not
suffer
for
i
had
no
sense
of
weakness
my
health
was
proof
against
everything
and
my
energies
defied
all
malice
of
circumstance
with
however
little
encouragement
i
had
infinite
hope
sound
sleep
often
in
places
i
now
dread
to
think
of
sent
me
fresh
to
the
battle
each
morning
my
breakfast
sometimes
no
more
than
a
slice
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
water
as
human
happiness
goes
i
am
not
sure
that
i
was
not
then
happy
most
men
who
go
through
a
hard
time
in
their
youth
are
supported
by
companionship
london
has
no
but
hungry
beginners
in
literature
have
generally
their
suitable
comrades
garreteers
in
the
tottenham
court
road
district
or
in
unredeemed
chelsea
they
make
their
little
de
and
are
consciously
proud
of
it
of
my
position
the
peculiarity
was
that
i
never
belonged
to
any
cluster
i
shrank
from
casual
acquaintance
and
through
the
grim
years
had
but
one
friend
with
whom
i
held
converse
it
was
never
my
instinct
to
look
for
help
to
seek
favour
for
advancement
whatever
step
i
gained
was
gained
by
my
own
strength
even
as
i
disregarded
favour
so
did
i
scorn
advice
no
counsel
would
i
ever
take
but
that
of
my
own
brain
and
heart
more
than
once
i
was
driven
by
necessity
to
beg
from
strangers
the
means
of
earning
bread
and
this
of
all
my
experiences
was
the
bitterest
yet
i
think
i
should
have
found
it
worse
still
to
incur
a
debt
to
some
friend
or
comrade
the
truth
is
that
i
have
never
learnt
to
regard
myself
as
a
member
of
society
for
me
there
have
always
been
two
entities
myself
and
the
world
and
the
normal
relation
between
these
two
has
been
hostile
am
i
not
still
a
lonely
man
as
far
as
ever
from
forming
part
of
the
social
order
this
of
which
i
once
was
scornfully
proud
seems
to
me
now
if
not
a
calamity
something
i
would
not
choose
if
life
were
to
live
again
ix
for
more
than
six
years
i
trod
the
pavement
never
stepping
once
upon
mother
earth
for
the
parks
are
but
pavement
disguised
with
a
growth
of
grass
then
the
worst
was
over
say
i
the
worst
no
no
things
far
worse
were
to
come
the
struggle
against
starvation
has
its
cheery
side
when
one
is
young
and
vigorous
but
at
all
events
i
had
begun
to
earn
a
living
i
held
assurance
of
food
and
clothing
for
half
a
year
at
a
time
granted
health
i
might
hope
to
draw
my
not
insufficient
wages
for
many
a
twelvemonth
and
they
were
the
wages
of
work
done
independently
when
and
where
i
would
i
thought
with
horror
of
lives
spent
in
an
office
with
an
employer
to
obey
the
glory
of
the
career
of
letters
was
its
freedom
its
dignity
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
of
course
that
i
served
not
one
master
but
a
whole
crowd
of
them
independence
forsooth
if
my
writing
failed
to
please
editor
publisher
public
where
was
my
daily
bread
the
greater
my
success
the
more
numerous
my
employers
i
was
the
slave
of
a
multitude
by
heaven
grace
i
had
succeeded
in
pleasing
that
is
to
say
in
making
myself
a
source
of
profit
to
certain
persons
who
represented
this
vague
throng
for
the
time
they
were
gracious
to
me
but
what
justified
me
in
the
faith
that
i
should
hold
the
ground
i
had
gained
could
the
position
of
any
toiling
man
be
more
precarious
than
mine
i
tremble
now
as
i
think
of
it
tremble
as
i
should
in
watching
some
one
who
walked
carelessly
on
the
edge
of
an
abyss
i
marvel
at
the
recollection
that
for
a
good
score
of
years
this
pen
and
a
scrap
of
paper
clothed
and
fed
me
and
my
household
kept
me
in
physical
comfort
held
at
bay
all
those
hostile
forces
of
the
world
ranged
against
one
who
has
no
resource
save
in
his
own
right
hand
but
i
was
thinking
of
the
year
which
saw
my
first
exodus
from
london
on
an
irresistible
impulse
i
suddenly
made
up
my
mind
to
go
into
devon
a
part
of
england
i
had
never
seen
at
the
end
of
march
i
escaped
from
my
grim
lodgings
and
before
i
had
time
to
reflect
on
the
details
of
my
undertaking
i
found
myself
sitting
in
sunshine
at
a
spot
very
near
to
where
i
now
dwell
before
me
the
green
valley
of
the
broadening
exe
and
the
ridge
of
haldon
that
was
one
of
the
moments
of
my
life
when
i
have
tasted
exquisite
joy
my
state
of
mind
was
very
strange
though
as
boy
and
youth
i
had
been
familiar
with
the
country
had
seen
much
of
england
beauties
it
was
as
though
i
found
myself
for
the
first
time
before
a
natural
landscape
those
years
of
london
had
obscured
all
my
earlier
life
i
was
like
a
man
and
bred
who
scarce
knows
anything
but
street
vistas
the
light
the
air
had
for
me
something
of
the
supernatural
affected
me
indeed
only
less
than
at
a
later
time
did
the
atmosphere
of
italy
it
was
glorious
spring
weather
a
few
white
clouds
floated
amid
the
blue
and
the
earth
had
an
intoxicating
fragrance
then
first
did
i
know
myself
for
a
how
had
i
lived
so
long
without
asking
whether
there
was
a
sun
in
the
heavens
or
not
under
that
radiant
firmament
i
could
have
thrown
myself
upon
my
knees
in
adoration
as
i
walked
i
found
myself
avoiding
every
strip
of
shadow
were
it
but
that
of
a
birch
trunk
i
felt
as
if
it
robbed
me
of
the
day
delight
i
went
that
the
golden
beams
might
shed
upon
me
their
unstinted
blessing
that
day
i
must
have
walked
some
thirty
miles
yet
i
knew
not
fatigue
could
i
but
have
once
more
the
strength
which
then
supported
me
i
had
stepped
into
a
new
life
between
the
man
i
had
been
and
that
which
i
now
became
there
was
a
very
notable
difference
in
a
single
day
i
had
matured
astonishingly
which
means
no
doubt
that
i
suddenly
entered
into
conscious
enjoyment
of
powers
and
sensibilities
which
had
been
developing
unknown
to
me
to
instance
only
one
point
till
then
i
had
cared
very
little
about
plants
and
flowers
but
now
i
found
myself
eagerly
interested
in
every
blossom
in
every
growth
of
the
wayside
as
i
walked
i
gathered
a
quantity
of
plants
promising
myself
to
buy
a
book
on
the
morrow
and
identify
them
all
nor
was
it
a
passing
humour
never
since
have
i
lost
my
pleasure
in
the
flowers
of
the
field
and
my
desire
to
know
them
all
my
ignorance
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
seems
to
me
now
very
shameful
but
i
was
merely
in
the
case
of
ordinary
people
whether
living
in
town
or
country
how
many
could
give
the
familiar
name
of
half
a
dozen
plants
plucked
at
random
from
beneath
the
hedge
in
springtime
to
me
the
flowers
became
symbolical
of
a
great
release
of
a
wonderful
awakening
my
eyes
had
all
at
once
been
opened
till
then
i
had
walked
in
darkness
yet
knew
it
not
well
do
i
remember
the
rambles
of
that
springtide
i
had
a
lodging
in
one
of
those
outer
streets
of
exeter
which
savour
more
of
country
than
of
town
and
every
morning
i
set
forth
to
make
discoveries
the
weather
could
not
have
been
more
kindly
i
felt
the
influences
of
a
climate
i
had
never
known
there
was
a
balm
in
the
air
which
soothed
no
less
than
it
exhilarated
me
now
inland
now
seaward
i
followed
the
windings
of
the
exe
one
day
i
wandered
in
rich
warm
valleys
by
orchards
bursting
into
bloom
from
farmhouse
to
farmhouse
each
more
beautiful
than
the
other
and
from
hamlet
to
hamlet
bowered
amid
dark
evergreens
the
next
i
was
on
heights
gazing
over
moorland
brown
with
last
heather
feeling
upon
my
face
a
wind
from
the
channel
so
intense
was
my
delight
in
the
beautiful
world
about
me
that
i
forgot
even
myself
i
enjoyed
without
retrospect
or
forecast
i
the
egoist
in
grain
forgot
to
scrutinize
my
own
emotions
or
to
trouble
my
happiness
by
comparison
with
others
happier
fortune
it
was
a
healthful
time
it
gave
me
a
new
lease
of
life
and
taught
me
in
so
far
as
i
was
teachable
how
to
make
use
of
it
mentally
and
physically
i
must
be
much
older
than
my
years
at
a
man
ought
not
to
be
brooding
constantly
on
his
vanished
youth
these
days
of
spring
which
i
should
be
enjoying
for
their
own
sake
do
but
turn
me
to
reminiscence
and
my
memories
are
of
the
springs
that
were
lost
some
day
i
will
go
to
london
and
revisit
all
the
places
where
i
housed
in
the
time
of
my
greatest
poverty
i
have
not
seen
them
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
or
so
not
long
ago
had
any
one
asked
me
how
i
felt
about
these
memories
i
should
have
said
that
there
were
certain
street
names
certain
mental
images
of
obscure
london
which
made
me
wretched
as
often
as
they
came
before
me
but
in
truth
it
is
a
very
long
time
since
i
was
moved
to
any
sort
of
bitterness
by
that
retrospect
of
things
hard
and
squalid
now
owning
all
the
misery
of
it
in
comparison
with
what
should
have
been
i
find
that
part
of
life
interesting
and
pleasant
to
look
back
upon
greatly
more
so
than
many
subsequent
times
when
i
lived
amid
decencies
and
had
enough
to
eat
some
day
i
will
go
to
london
and
spend
a
day
or
two
amid
the
dear
old
horrors
some
of
the
places
i
know
have
disappeared
i
see
the
winding
way
by
which
i
went
from
oxford
street
at
the
foot
of
tottenham
court
road
to
leicester
square
and
somewhere
in
the
labyrinth
i
think
of
it
as
always
foggy
and
was
a
shop
which
had
pies
and
puddings
in
the
window
puddings
and
pies
kept
hot
by
steam
rising
through
perforated
metal
how
many
a
time
have
i
stood
there
raging
with
hunger
unable
to
purchase
even
one
pennyworth
of
food
the
shop
and
the
street
have
long
since
vanished
does
any
man
remember
them
so
feelingly
as
i
but
i
think
most
of
my
haunts
are
still
in
existence
to
tread
again
those
pavements
to
look
at
those
grimy
doorways
and
purblind
windows
would
affect
me
strangely
i
see
that
alley
hidden
on
the
west
side
of
tottenham
court
road
where
after
living
in
a
back
bedroom
on
the
top
floor
i
had
to
exchange
for
the
front
cellar
there
was
a
difference
if
i
remember
rightly
of
sixpence
a
week
and
sixpence
in
those
days
was
a
very
great
consideration
why
it
meant
a
couple
of
meals
i
once
sixpence
in
the
street
and
had
an
exultation
which
is
vivid
in
me
at
this
moment
the
front
cellar
was
its
furniture
was
a
table
a
chair
a
and
a
bed
the
window
which
of
course
had
never
been
cleaned
since
it
was
put
in
received
light
through
a
flat
grating
in
the
alley
above
here
i
lived
here
yes
literary
work
was
done
at
that
filthy
deal
table
on
which
by
the
bye
lay
my
homer
my
shakespeare
and
the
few
other
books
i
then
possessed
at
night
as
i
lay
in
bed
i
used
to
hear
the
tramp
tramp
of
a
of
policemen
who
passed
along
the
alley
on
their
way
to
relieve
guard
their
heavy
feet
sometimes
sounded
on
the
grating
above
my
window
i
recall
a
incident
of
life
at
the
british
museum
once
on
going
down
into
the
lavatory
to
wash
my
hands
i
became
aware
of
a
notice
newly
set
up
above
the
row
of
basins
it
ran
somehow
thus
readers
are
requested
to
bear
in
mind
that
these
basins
are
to
be
used
only
for
casual
ablutions
oh
the
significance
of
that
inscription
had
i
not
myself
more
than
once
been
glad
to
use
this
soap
and
water
more
largely
than
the
sense
of
the
authorities
contemplated
and
there
were
poor
fellows
working
under
the
great
dome
whose
need
in
this
respect
was
greater
than
mine
i
laughed
heartily
at
the
notice
but
it
meant
so
much
some
of
my
abodes
i
have
utterly
forgotten
for
one
reason
or
another
i
was
always
moving
an
easy
matter
when
all
my
possessions
lay
in
one
small
trunk
sometimes
the
people
of
the
house
were
intolerable
in
those
days
i
was
not
fastidious
and
i
seldom
had
any
but
the
slightest
intercourse
with
those
who
dwelt
under
the
same
roof
yet
it
happened
now
and
then
that
i
was
driven
away
by
human
proximity
which
passed
my
endurance
in
other
cases
i
had
to
flee
from
pestilential
conditions
how
i
escaped
mortal
illness
in
some
of
those
places
miserably
fed
as
i
always
was
and
always
myself
is
a
great
mystery
the
worst
that
befell
me
was
a
slight
attack
of
diphtheria
traceable
i
imagine
to
the
existence
of
a
the
when
i
spoke
of
the
matter
to
my
landlady
she
was
at
first
astonished
then
wrathful
and
my
departure
was
expedited
with
many
insults
on
the
whole
however
i
had
nothing
much
to
complain
of
except
my
poverty
you
can
not
expect
great
comfort
in
london
for
a
week
the
most
i
ever
could
pay
for
a
furnished
room
with
attendance
in
those
days
of
pretty
stern
apprenticeship
and
i
was
easily
satisfied
i
wanted
only
a
little
walled
space
in
which
i
could
seclude
myself
free
from
external
annoyance
certain
comforts
of
civilized
life
i
ceased
even
to
regret
a
i
regarded
as
rather
extravagant
and
a
carpet
on
the
floor
of
my
room
was
luxury
undreamt
of
my
sleep
was
sound
i
have
passed
nights
of
dreamless
repose
on
beds
which
it
would
now
make
my
bones
ache
only
to
look
at
a
door
that
locked
a
fire
in
winter
a
pipe
of
tobacco
these
were
things
essential
and
granted
these
i
have
been
often
richly
contented
in
the
squalidest
garret
one
such
lodging
is
often
in
my
memory
it
was
at
islington
not
far
from
the
city
road
my
window
looked
upon
the
regent
canal
as
often
as
i
think
of
it
i
recall
what
was
perhaps
the
worst
london
fog
i
ever
knew
for
three
successive
days
at
least
my
lamp
had
to
be
kept
burning
when
i
looked
through
the
window
i
saw
at
moments
a
few
blurred
lights
in
the
street
beyond
the
canal
but
for
the
most
part
nothing
but
a
yellowish
darkness
which
caused
the
glass
to
reflect
the
firelight
and
my
own
face
did
i
feel
miserable
not
a
bit
of
it
the
enveloping
gloom
seemed
to
make
my
only
the
more
cosy
i
had
coals
oil
tobacco
in
sufficient
quantity
i
had
a
book
to
read
i
had
work
which
interested
me
so
i
went
forth
only
to
get
my
meals
at
a
city
road
shop
and
hastened
back
to
the
fireside
oh
my
ambitions
my
hopes
how
surprised
and
indignant
i
should
have
felt
had
i
known
of
any
one
who
pitied
me
nature
took
revenge
now
and
then
in
winter
time
i
had
fierce
sore
throats
sometimes
accompanied
by
long
and
savage
headaches
doctoring
of
course
never
occurred
to
me
i
just
locked
my
door
and
if
i
felt
very
bad
indeed
went
to
bed
to
lie
there
without
food
or
drink
till
i
was
able
to
look
after
myself
again
i
could
never
ask
from
a
landlady
anything
which
was
not
in
our
bond
and
only
once
or
twice
did
i
receive
spontaneous
offer
of
help
oh
it
is
wonderful
to
think
of
all
that
youth
can
endure
what
a
poor
feeble
wretch
i
now
seem
to
myself
when
i
remember
thirty
years
ago
xi
would
i
live
it
over
again
that
life
of
the
garret
and
the
cellar
not
with
the
assurance
of
fifty
years
contentment
such
as
i
now
enjoy
to
follow
upon
it
with
man
infinitely
pathetic
power
of
resignation
one
sees
the
thing
on
its
better
side
forgets
all
the
worst
of
it
makes
out
a
case
for
the
resolute
optimist
oh
but
the
waste
of
energy
of
zeal
of
youth
in
another
mood
i
could
shed
tears
over
that
spectacle
of
rare
vitality
condemned
to
sordid
strife
the
pity
of
it
and
if
our
conscience
mean
anything
at
all
the
bitter
wrong
without
seeking
for
utopia
think
what
a
man
youth
might
be
i
suppose
not
one
in
every
thousand
uses
half
the
possibilities
of
natural
joy
and
delightful
effort
which
lie
in
those
years
between
seventeen
and
all
but
all
men
have
to
look
back
upon
beginnings
of
life
deformed
and
discoloured
by
necessity
accident
wantonness
if
a
young
man
avoid
the
grosser
pitfalls
if
he
keep
his
eye
fixed
steadily
on
what
is
called
the
main
chance
if
without
flagrant
selfishness
he
prudently
subdue
every
interest
to
his
own
by
interest
understanding
only
material
good
he
is
putting
his
youth
to
profit
he
is
an
exemplar
and
a
subject
of
pride
i
doubt
whether
in
our
civilization
any
other
ideal
is
easy
of
pursuit
by
the
youngster
face
to
face
with
life
it
is
the
only
course
altogether
safe
yet
compare
it
with
what
might
be
if
men
respected
manhood
if
human
reason
were
at
the
service
of
human
happiness
some
few
there
are
who
can
look
back
upon
a
boyhood
of
natural
delights
followed
by
a
decade
or
so
of
fine
energies
honourably
put
to
use
blended
therewith
perhaps
a
memory
of
joy
so
exquisite
that
it
tunes
all
life
unto
the
end
they
are
almost
as
rare
as
poets
the
vast
majority
think
not
of
their
youth
at
all
or
glancing
backward
are
unconscious
of
lost
opportunity
unaware
of
degradation
suffered
only
by
contrast
with
this
multitude
can
i
pride
myself
upon
my
youth
of
endurance
and
of
combat
i
had
a
goal
before
me
and
not
the
goal
of
the
average
man
even
when
pinched
with
hunger
i
did
not
abandon
my
purposes
which
were
of
the
mind
but
contrast
that
starved
lad
in
his
slum
lodging
with
any
fair
conception
of
intelligent
and
zealous
youth
and
one
feels
that
a
dose
of
swift
poison
would
have
been
the
right
remedy
for
such
squalid
ills
xii
as
often
as
i
survey
my
bookshelves
i
am
reminded
of
lamb
ragged
veterans
not
that
all
my
volumes
came
from
the
stall
many
of
them
were
neat
enough
in
new
covers
some
were
even
stately
in
fragrant
bindings
when
they
passed
into
my
hands
but
so
often
have
i
removed
so
rough
has
been
the
treatment
of
my
little
library
at
each
change
of
place
and
to
tell
the
truth
so
little
care
have
i
given
to
its
at
normal
times
for
in
all
practical
matters
i
am
idle
and
inept
that
even
the
comeliest
of
my
books
show
the
results
of
unfair
usage
more
than
one
has
been
foully
injured
by
a
great
nail
driven
into
a
this
but
the
extreme
instance
of
the
wrongs
they
have
undergone
now
that
i
have
leisure
and
peace
of
mind
i
find
myself
growing
more
careful
an
illustration
of
the
great
truth
that
virtue
is
made
easy
by
circumstance
but
i
confess
that
so
long
as
a
volume
hold
together
i
am
not
much
troubled
as
to
its
outer
appearance
i
know
men
who
say
they
had
as
lief
read
any
book
in
a
library
copy
as
in
one
from
their
own
shelf
to
me
that
is
unintelligible
for
one
thing
i
know
every
book
of
mine
by
its
and
i
have
but
to
put
my
nose
between
the
pages
to
be
reminded
of
all
sorts
of
things
my
gibbon
for
example
my
milman
edition
which
i
have
read
and
read
and
read
again
for
more
than
thirty
years
never
do
i
open
it
but
the
scent
of
the
noble
page
restores
to
me
all
the
exultant
happiness
of
that
moment
when
i
received
it
as
a
prize
or
my
shakespeare
the
great
cambridge
shakespeare
it
has
an
odour
which
carries
me
yet
further
back
in
life
for
these
volumes
belonged
to
my
father
and
before
i
was
old
enough
to
read
them
with
understanding
it
was
often
permitted
me
as
a
treat
to
take
down
one
of
them
from
the
bookcase
and
reverently
to
turn
the
leaves
the
volumes
smell
exactly
as
they
did
in
that
old
time
and
what
a
strange
tenderness
comes
upon
me
when
i
hold
one
of
them
in
hand
for
that
reason
i
do
not
often
read
shakespeare
in
this
edition
my
eyes
being
good
as
ever
i
take
the
globe
volume
which
i
bought
in
days
when
such
a
purchase
was
something
more
than
an
extravagance
wherefore
i
regard
the
book
with
that
peculiar
affection
which
results
from
sacrifice
sacrifice
in
no
sense
of
the
word
dozens
of
my
books
were
purchased
with
money
which
ought
to
have
been
spent
upon
what
are
called
the
necessaries
of
life
many
a
time
i
have
stood
before
a
stall
or
a
bookseller
window
torn
by
conflict
of
intellectual
desire
and
bodily
need
at
the
very
hour
of
dinner
when
my
stomach
clamoured
for
food
i
have
been
stopped
by
sight
of
a
volume
so
long
coveted
and
marked
at
so
advantageous
a
price
that
i
not
let
it
go
yet
to
buy
it
meant
pangs
of
famine
my
heyne
was
grasped
at
such
a
moment
it
lay
on
the
stall
of
the
old
in
goodge
street
a
stall
where
now
and
then
one
found
an
excellent
thing
among
quantities
of
rubbish
sixpence
was
the
price
sixpence
at
that
time
i
used
to
eat
my
meal
of
course
my
dinner
at
a
in
oxford
street
one
of
the
real
old
such
as
now
i
suppose
can
hardly
be
found
sixpence
was
all
i
had
yes
all
i
had
in
the
world
it
would
purchase
a
plate
of
meat
and
vegetables
but
i
did
not
dare
to
hope
that
the
would
wait
until
the
morrow
when
a
certain
small
sum
fell
due
to
me
i
paced
the
pavement
fingering
the
coppers
in
my
pocket
eyeing
the
stall
two
appetites
at
combat
within
me
the
book
was
bought
and
i
went
home
with
it
and
as
i
made
a
dinner
of
bread
and
butter
i
gloated
over
the
pages
in
this
i
found
pencilled
on
the
last
page
perlegi
who
was
that
possessor
of
the
book
nearly
a
hundred
years
ago
there
was
no
other
inscription
i
like
to
imagine
some
poor
scholar
poor
and
eager
as
i
myself
who
bought
the
volume
with
drops
of
his
blood
and
enjoyed
the
reading
of
it
even
as
i
did
how
much
was
i
could
not
easily
say
tibullus
of
whom
there
remains
to
us
a
poet
portrait
more
delightful
i
think
than
anything
of
the
kind
in
roman
literature
an
tacitum
silvas
inter
reptare
salubres
curantem
quidquid
dignum
sapiente
bonoque
est
so
with
many
another
book
on
the
thronged
shelves
to
take
them
down
is
to
recall
how
vividly
a
struggle
and
a
triumph
in
those
days
money
represented
nothing
to
me
nothing
i
cared
to
think
about
but
the
acquisition
of
books
there
were
books
of
which
i
had
passionate
need
books
more
necessary
to
me
than
bodily
nourishment
i
could
see
them
of
course
at
the
british
museum
but
that
was
not
at
all
the
same
thing
as
having
and
holding
them
my
own
property
on
my
own
shelf
now
and
then
i
have
bought
a
volume
of
the
raggedest
and
wretchedest
aspect
dishonoured
with
foolish
scribbling
torn
blotted
no
matter
i
liked
better
to
read
out
of
that
than
out
of
a
copy
that
was
not
mine
but
i
was
guilty
at
times
of
mere
a
book
tempted
me
a
book
which
was
not
one
of
those
for
which
i
really
craved
a
luxury
which
prudence
might
bid
me
forego
as
for
instance
my
it
caught
my
eye
in
holywell
street
the
name
was
familiar
to
me
in
und
and
curiosity
grew
as
i
glanced
over
the
pages
but
that
day
i
resisted
in
truth
i
could
not
afford
the
which
means
that
just
then
i
was
poor
indeed
twice
again
did
i
pass
each
time
assuring
myself
that
had
found
no
purchaser
there
came
a
day
when
i
was
in
funds
i
see
myself
hastening
to
holywell
street
in
those
days
my
habitual
pace
was
five
miles
an
hour
i
see
the
little
grey
old
man
with
whom
i
transacted
my
business
what
was
his
name
the
bookseller
who
had
been
i
believe
a
catholic
priest
and
still
had
a
certain
priestly
dignity
about
him
he
took
the
volume
opened
it
mused
for
a
moment
then
with
a
glance
at
me
said
as
if
thinking
aloud
yes
i
wish
i
had
time
to
read
it
sometimes
i
added
the
labour
of
a
porter
to
my
fasting
endured
for
the
sake
of
books
at
the
little
shop
near
portland
road
station
i
came
upon
a
first
edition
of
gibbon
the
price
an
absurdity
i
think
it
was
a
shilling
a
volume
to
possess
those
quartos
i
would
have
sold
my
coat
as
it
happened
i
had
not
money
enough
with
me
but
sufficient
at
home
i
was
living
at
islington
having
spoken
with
the
bookseller
i
walked
home
took
the
cash
walked
back
again
and
carried
the
tomes
from
the
west
end
of
euston
road
to
a
street
in
islington
far
beyond
the
i
did
it
in
two
journeys
this
being
the
only
time
in
my
life
when
i
thought
of
gibbon
in
avoirdupois
twice
three
times
reckoning
the
walk
for
the
money
did
i
descend
euston
road
and
climb
pentonville
on
that
occasion
of
the
season
and
the
weather
i
have
no
recollection
my
joy
in
the
purchase
i
had
made
drove
out
every
other
thought
except
indeed
of
the
weight
i
had
infinite
energy
but
not
much
muscular
strength
and
the
end
of
the
last
journey
saw
me
upon
a
chair
perspiring
flaccid
aching
exultant
the
person
would
hear
this
story
with
astonishment
why
did
i
not
get
the
bookseller
to
send
me
the
volumes
or
if
i
could
not
wait
was
there
no
omnibus
along
that
london
highway
how
could
i
make
the
person
understand
that
i
did
not
feel
able
to
afford
that
day
one
penny
more
than
i
had
spent
on
the
book
no
no
such
saving
expenditure
did
not
come
within
my
scope
whatever
i
enjoyed
i
earned
it
literally
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
in
those
days
i
hardly
knew
what
it
was
to
travel
by
omnibus
i
have
walked
london
streets
for
twelve
and
fifteen
hours
together
without
ever
a
thought
of
saving
my
legs
or
my
time
by
paying
for
waftage
being
poor
as
poor
can
be
there
were
certain
things
i
had
to
renounce
and
this
was
one
of
them
years
after
i
sold
my
first
edition
of
gibbon
for
even
less
than
it
cost
me
it
went
with
a
great
many
other
fine
books
in
folio
and
quarto
which
i
could
not
drag
about
with
me
in
my
constant
removals
the
man
who
bought
them
spoke
of
them
as
why
has
gibbon
no
market
value
often
has
my
heart
ached
with
regret
for
those
quartos
the
joy
of
reading
the
decline
and
fall
in
that
fine
type
the
page
was
appropriate
to
the
dignity
of
the
subject
the
mere
sight
of
it
tuned
one
mind
i
suppose
i
could
easily
get
another
copy
now
but
it
would
not
be
to
me
what
that
other
was
with
its
memory
of
dust
and
toil
xiii
there
must
be
several
men
of
spirit
and
experiences
akin
to
mine
who
remember
that
little
opposite
portland
road
station
it
had
a
peculiar
character
the
books
were
of
a
solid
kind
chiefly
theology
and
classics
and
for
the
most
part
those
old
editions
which
are
called
worthless
which
have
no
bibliopolic
value
and
have
been
supplanted
for
practical
use
by
modern
issues
the
bookseller
was
very
much
a
gentleman
and
this
singular
fact
together
with
the
extremely
low
prices
at
which
his
volumes
were
marked
sometimes
inclined
me
to
think
that
he
kept
the
shop
for
mere
love
of
letters
things
in
my
eyes
inestimable
i
have
purchased
there
for
a
few
pence
and
i
do
think
i
ever
gave
more
than
a
shilling
for
any
volume
as
i
once
had
the
opportunity
of
perceiving
a
young
man
fresh
from
could
only
look
with
wondering
contempt
on
the
antiquated
stuff
which
it
rejoiced
me
to
gather
from
that
kindly
stall
or
from
the
richer
shelves
within
my
for
instance
podgy
volumes
in
parchment
with
all
the
notes
of
graevius
gronovius
and
i
know
not
how
many
other
old
scholars
pooh
hopelessly
out
of
date
but
i
could
never
feel
that
i
have
a
deep
affection
for
graevius
and
gronovius
and
the
rest
and
if
i
knew
as
much
as
they
did
i
should
be
well
satisfied
to
rest
under
the
young
disdain
the
zeal
of
learning
is
never
out
of
date
the
example
were
there
no
more
burns
before
one
as
a
sacred
fire
for
ever
unquenchable
in
what
modern
editor
shall
i
find
such
love
and
enthusiasm
as
glows
in
the
annotations
of
old
scholars
even
the
best
editions
of
our
day
have
so
much
of
the
mere
you
feel
so
often
that
the
man
does
not
regard
his
author
as
literature
but
simply
as
text
pedant
for
pedant
the
old
is
better
than
the
new
xiv
newspaper
contains
a
yard
or
so
of
reading
about
a
spring
race
the
sight
of
it
fills
me
with
loathing
it
brings
to
my
mind
that
placard
i
saw
at
a
station
in
surrey
a
year
or
two
ago
advertising
certain
races
in
the
neighbourhood
here
is
the
poster
as
i
copied
it
into
my
engaged
by
the
executive
to
ensure
order
and
comfort
to
the
public
attending
this
meeting
detectives
racing
detectives
scotland
yard
police
inspectors
police
sergeants
police
and
a
supernumerary
contingent
of
specially
selected
men
from
the
army
reserve
and
the
corps
of
commissionaires
the
above
force
will
be
employed
solely
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
order
and
excluding
bad
characters
etc
they
will
have
the
assistance
also
of
a
strong
force
of
the
surrey
constabulary
i
remember
once
when
i
let
fall
a
remark
on
the
subject
of
among
friends
chatting
together
i
was
voted
morose
is
it
really
morose
to
object
to
public
gatherings
which
their
own
promoters
declare
to
be
dangerous
for
all
decent
folk
every
one
knows
that
is
carried
on
mainly
for
the
delight
and
profit
of
fools
ruffians
and
thieves
that
intelligent
men
allow
themselves
to
take
part
in
the
affair
and
defend
their
conduct
by
declaring
that
their
presence
maintains
the
character
of
a
sport
essentially
noble
merely
shows
that
intelligence
can
easily
enough
divest
itself
of
sense
and
decency
xv
midway
in
my
long
walk
yesterday
i
lunched
at
a
wayside
inn
on
the
table
lay
a
copy
of
a
popular
magazine
glancing
over
this
miscellany
i
found
an
article
by
a
woman
on
lion
hunting
and
in
this
article
i
came
upon
a
passage
which
seemed
worth
copying
as
i
woke
my
husband
the
lion
which
was
then
about
forty
yards
off
charged
straight
towards
us
and
with
my
i
hit
him
full
in
the
chest
as
we
afterwards
discovered
tearing
his
windpipe
to
pieces
and
breaking
his
spine
he
charged
a
second
time
and
the
next
shot
hit
him
through
the
shoulder
tearing
his
heart
to
ribbons
it
would
interest
me
to
look
upon
this
heroine
of
gun
and
pen
she
is
presumably
quite
a
young
woman
probably
when
at
home
a
graceful
figure
in
i
should
like
to
hear
her
talk
to
exchange
thoughts
with
her
she
would
give
one
a
very
good
idea
of
the
matron
of
old
rome
who
had
her
seat
in
the
amphitheatre
many
of
those
ladies
in
private
life
must
have
been
bright
and
gracious
and
full
of
agreeable
sentiment
they
talked
of
art
and
of
letters
they
could
drop
a
tear
over
lesbia
sparrow
at
the
same
time
they
were
connoisseurs
in
torn
windpipes
shattered
spines
and
viscera
rent
open
it
is
not
likely
that
many
of
them
would
have
cared
to
turn
their
own
hands
to
butchery
and
for
the
matter
of
that
i
must
suppose
that
our
lion
huntress
of
the
popular
magazine
is
rather
an
exceptional
dame
but
no
doubt
she
and
the
roman
ladies
would
get
on
very
well
together
finding
only
a
few
superficial
differences
the
fact
that
her
gory
reminiscences
are
welcomed
by
an
editor
with
the
popular
taste
in
view
is
perhaps
more
significant
than
appears
either
to
editor
or
public
were
this
lady
to
write
a
novel
the
chances
are
she
will
it
would
have
the
true
note
of
modern
vigour
of
course
her
style
has
been
formed
by
her
favourite
reading
more
than
probably
her
ways
of
thinking
and
feeling
owe
much
to
the
same
source
if
not
so
already
this
will
soon
i
daresay
be
the
typical
englishwoman
certainly
there
is
no
nonsense
about
her
such
women
should
breed
a
remarkable
race
i
left
the
inn
in
rather
a
turbid
humour
moving
homeward
by
a
new
way
i
presently
found
myself
on
the
side
of
a
little
valley
in
which
lay
a
farm
and
an
orchard
the
apple
trees
were
in
full
bloom
and
as
i
stood
gazing
the
sun
which
had
all
that
day
been
niggard
of
its
beams
burst
forth
gloriously
for
what
i
then
saw
i
have
no
words
i
can
but
dream
of
the
still
loveliness
of
that
blossomed
valley
near
me
a
bee
was
humming
not
far
away
a
cuckoo
called
from
the
pasture
of
the
farm
below
came
a
bleating
of
lambs
xvi
i
am
no
friend
of
the
people
as
a
force
by
which
the
tenor
of
the
time
is
conditioned
they
inspire
me
with
distrust
with
fear
as
a
visible
multitude
they
make
me
shrink
aloof
and
often
move
me
to
abhorrence
for
the
greater
part
of
my
life
the
people
signified
to
me
the
london
crowd
and
no
phrase
of
temperate
meaning
would
utter
my
thoughts
of
them
under
that
aspect
the
people
as
are
little
known
to
me
such
glimpses
as
i
have
had
of
them
do
not
invite
to
nearer
acquaintance
every
instinct
of
my
being
is
and
i
dread
to
think
of
what
our
england
may
become
when
demos
rules
irresistibly
right
or
wrong
this
is
my
temper
but
he
who
should
argue
from
it
that
i
am
intolerant
of
all
persons
belonging
to
a
lower
social
rank
than
my
own
would
go
far
astray
nothing
is
more
rooted
in
my
mind
than
the
vast
distinction
between
the
individual
and
the
class
take
a
man
by
himself
and
there
is
generally
some
reason
to
be
found
in
him
some
disposition
for
good
mass
him
with
his
fellows
in
the
social
organism
and
ten
to
one
he
becomes
a
blatant
creature
without
a
thought
of
his
own
ready
for
any
evil
to
which
contagion
prompts
him
it
is
because
nations
tend
to
stupidity
and
baseness
that
mankind
moves
so
slowly
it
is
because
individuals
have
a
capacity
for
better
things
that
it
moves
at
all
in
my
youth
looking
at
this
man
and
that
i
marvelled
that
humanity
had
made
so
little
progress
now
looking
at
men
in
the
multitude
i
marvel
that
they
have
advanced
so
far
foolishly
arrogant
as
i
was
i
used
to
judge
the
worth
of
a
person
by
his
intellectual
power
and
attainment
i
could
see
no
good
where
there
was
no
logic
no
charm
where
there
was
no
learning
now
i
think
that
one
has
to
distinguish
between
two
forms
of
intelligence
that
of
the
brain
and
that
of
the
heart
and
i
have
come
to
regard
the
second
as
by
far
the
more
important
i
guard
myself
against
saying
that
intelligence
does
not
matter
the
fool
is
ever
as
noxious
as
he
is
wearisome
but
assuredly
the
best
people
i
have
known
were
saved
from
folly
not
by
the
intellect
but
by
the
heart
they
come
before
me
and
i
see
them
greatly
ignorant
strongly
prejudiced
capable
of
the
absurdest
yet
their
faces
shine
with
the
supreme
virtues
kindness
sweetness
modesty
generosity
possessing
these
qualities
they
at
the
same
time
understand
how
to
use
them
they
have
the
intelligence
of
the
heart
this
poor
woman
who
labours
for
me
in
my
house
is
even
such
a
one
from
the
first
i
thought
her
an
unusually
good
servant
after
three
years
of
acquaintance
i
find
her
one
of
the
few
women
i
have
known
who
merit
the
term
of
excellent
she
can
read
and
write
that
is
all
more
instruction
would
i
am
sure
have
harmed
her
for
it
would
have
confused
her
natural
motives
without
supplying
any
clear
ray
of
mental
guidance
she
is
fulfilling
the
offices
for
which
she
was
born
and
that
with
a
grace
of
contentment
a
joy
of
conscientiousness
which
puts
her
high
among
civilized
beings
her
delight
is
in
order
and
in
peace
what
greater
praise
can
be
given
to
any
of
the
children
of
men
the
other
day
she
told
me
a
story
of
the
days
gone
by
her
mother
at
the
age
of
twelve
went
into
domestic
service
but
on
what
conditions
think
you
the
girl
father
an
honest
labouring
man
the
person
whose
house
she
entered
one
shilling
a
week
for
her
instruction
in
the
duties
she
wished
to
undertake
what
a
grinning
stare
would
come
to
the
face
of
any
labourer
nowadays
who
should
be
asked
to
do
the
like
i
no
longer
wonder
that
my
housekeeper
so
little
resembles
the
average
of
her
kind
xvii
a
day
of
almost
continuous
rain
yet
for
me
a
day
of
delight
i
had
breakfasted
and
was
poring
over
the
map
of
devon
how
i
love
a
good
map
to
trace
an
expedition
that
i
have
in
view
when
a
knock
came
at
my
door
and
bore
in
a
great
parcel
which
i
saw
at
a
glance
must
contain
books
the
order
was
sent
to
london
a
few
days
ago
i
had
not
expected
to
have
my
books
so
soon
with
throbbing
heart
i
set
the
parcel
on
a
clear
table
eyed
it
whilst
i
mended
the
fire
then
took
my
and
gravely
deliberately
though
with
hand
that
trembled
began
to
unpack
it
is
a
joy
to
go
through
booksellers
catalogues
ticking
here
and
there
a
possible
purchase
formerly
when
i
could
seldom
spare
money
i
kept
catalogues
as
much
as
possible
out
of
sight
now
i
savour
them
page
by
page
and
make
a
pleasant
virtue
of
the
discretion
i
must
needs
impose
upon
myself
but
greater
still
is
the
happiness
of
unpacking
volumes
which
one
has
bought
without
seeing
them
i
am
no
hunter
of
rarities
i
care
nothing
for
first
editions
and
for
tall
copies
what
i
buy
is
literature
food
for
the
soul
of
man
the
first
glimpse
of
bindings
when
the
inmost
protective
wrapper
has
been
folded
back
the
first
scent
of
the
first
gleam
of
a
gilded
title
here
is
a
work
the
name
of
which
has
been
known
to
me
for
half
a
lifetime
but
which
i
never
yet
saw
i
take
it
reverently
in
my
hand
gently
i
open
it
my
eyes
are
dim
with
excitement
as
i
glance
over
and
anticipate
the
treat
which
awaits
me
who
more
than
i
has
taken
to
heart
that
sentence
of
the
in
omnibus
requiem
quaesivi
et
nusquam
inveni
nisi
in
angulo
cum
libro
i
had
in
me
the
making
of
a
scholar
with
leisure
and
tranquillity
of
mind
i
should
have
amassed
learning
within
the
walls
of
a
college
i
should
have
lived
so
happily
so
harmlessly
my
imagination
ever
busy
with
the
old
world
in
the
introduction
to
his
history
of
france
michelet
says
passe
a
cote
du
monde
et
pris
pour
la
vie
that
as
i
can
see
now
was
my
true
ideal
through
all
my
battlings
and
miseries
i
have
always
lived
more
in
the
past
than
in
the
present
at
the
time
when
i
was
literally
starving
in
london
when
it
seemed
impossible
that
i
should
ever
gain
a
living
by
my
pen
how
many
days
have
i
spent
at
the
british
museum
reading
as
disinterestedly
as
if
i
had
been
without
a
care
it
astounds
me
to
remember
that
having
breakfasted
on
dry
bread
and
carrying
in
my
pocket
another
piece
of
bread
to
serve
for
dinner
i
settled
myself
at
a
desk
in
the
great
with
books
before
me
which
by
no
possibility
could
be
a
source
of
immediate
profit
at
such
a
time
i
worked
through
german
tomes
on
ancient
philosophy
at
such
a
time
i
read
appuleius
and
lucian
petronius
and
the
greek
anthology
diogenes
laertius
and
heaven
knows
what
my
hunger
was
forgotten
the
garret
to
which
i
must
return
to
pass
the
night
never
perturbed
my
thoughts
on
the
whole
it
seems
to
me
something
to
be
rather
proud
of
i
smile
approvingly
at
that
thin
youth
me
my
very
self
no
no
he
has
been
dead
these
thirty
years
scholarship
in
the
high
sense
was
denied
me
and
now
it
is
too
late
yet
here
am
i
gloating
over
pausanias
and
promising
myself
to
read
every
word
of
him
who
that
has
any
tincture
of
old
letters
would
not
like
to
read
pausanias
instead
of
mere
quotations
from
him
and
references
to
him
here
are
the
volumes
of
dahn
konige
der
who
would
not
like
to
know
all
he
can
about
the
teutonic
conquerors
of
rome
and
so
on
and
so
on
to
the
end
i
shall
be
reading
and
forgetting
ah
that
the
worst
of
it
had
i
at
command
all
the
knowledge
i
have
at
any
time
possessed
i
might
call
myself
a
learned
man
nothing
surely
is
so
bad
for
the
memory
as
worry
agitation
fear
i
can
not
preserve
more
than
a
few
fragments
of
what
i
read
yet
read
i
shall
persistently
rejoicingly
would
i
gather
erudition
for
a
future
life
indeed
it
no
longer
troubles
me
that
i
forget
i
have
the
happiness
of
the
passing
moment
and
what
more
can
mortal
ask
xviii
is
it
i
henry
ryecroft
who
after
a
night
of
untroubled
rest
rise
unhurriedly
dress
with
the
deliberation
of
an
oldish
man
and
go
downstairs
happy
in
the
thought
that
i
can
sit
reading
quietly
reading
all
day
long
is
it
i
henry
ryecroft
the
harassed
toiler
of
so
many
a
long
year
i
dare
not
think
of
those
i
have
left
behind
me
there
in
the
world
it
would
make
me
miserable
and
to
what
purpose
yet
having
once
looked
that
way
think
of
them
i
must
oh
you
who
at
this
hour
sit
down
to
the
cursed
travail
of
the
pen
writing
not
because
there
is
something
in
your
mind
in
your
heart
which
must
needs
be
uttered
but
because
the
pen
is
the
only
tool
you
can
handle
your
only
means
of
earning
bread
year
after
year
the
number
of
you
is
multiplied
you
crowd
the
doors
of
publishers
and
editors
hustling
grappling
exchanging
maledictions
oh
sorry
spectacle
grotesque
and
innumerable
are
the
men
and
women
now
writing
for
bread
who
have
not
the
least
chance
of
finding
in
such
work
a
permanent
livelihood
they
took
to
writing
because
they
knew
not
what
else
to
do
or
because
the
literary
calling
tempted
them
by
its
independence
and
its
dazzling
prizes
they
will
hang
on
to
the
squalid
profession
their
earnings
eked
out
by
begging
and
borrowing
until
it
is
too
late
for
them
to
do
anything
else
and
then
with
a
lifetime
of
dread
experience
behind
me
i
say
that
he
who
encourages
any
young
man
or
woman
to
look
for
his
living
to
literature
commits
no
less
than
a
crime
if
my
voice
had
any
authority
i
would
cry
this
truth
aloud
wherever
men
could
hear
hateful
as
is
the
struggle
for
life
in
every
form
this
of
the
literary
arena
seems
to
me
sordid
and
degrading
beyond
all
others
oh
your
prices
per
thousand
words
oh
your
paragraphings
and
your
interviewings
and
oh
the
black
despair
that
awaits
those
in
the
fray
last
midsummer
i
received
a
circular
from
a
typewriting
person
soliciting
my
custom
some
one
who
had
somehow
got
hold
of
my
name
and
fancied
me
to
be
still
in
purgatory
this
person
wrote
if
you
should
be
in
need
of
any
extra
assistance
in
the
pressure
of
your
christmas
work
i
hope
etc
how
otherwise
could
one
write
if
addressing
a
shopkeeper
the
pressure
of
your
christmas
work
nay
i
am
too
sick
to
laugh
xix
some
one
i
see
is
lifting
up
his
sweet
voice
in
praise
of
conscription
it
is
only
at
long
intervals
that
one
reads
this
kind
of
thing
in
our
reviews
or
newspapers
and
i
am
happy
in
believing
that
most
english
people
are
affected
by
it
even
as
i
am
with
the
sickness
of
dread
and
of
disgust
that
the
thing
is
impossible
in
england
who
would
venture
to
say
every
one
who
can
think
at
all
sees
how
slight
are
our
safeguards
against
that
barbaric
force
in
man
which
the
privileged
races
have
so
slowly
and
painfully
brought
into
check
democracy
is
full
of
menace
to
all
the
finer
hopes
of
civilization
and
the
revival
in
not
unnatural
companionship
with
it
of
monarchic
power
based
on
militarism
makes
the
prospect
dubious
enough
there
has
but
to
arise
some
lord
of
slaughter
and
the
nations
will
be
tearing
at
each
other
throats
let
england
be
imperilled
and
englishmen
will
fight
in
such
extremity
there
is
no
choice
but
what
a
dreary
change
must
come
upon
our
islanders
if
without
instant
danger
they
bend
beneath
the
curse
of
universal
soldiering
i
like
to
think
that
they
will
guard
the
liberty
of
their
manhood
even
beyond
the
point
of
prudence
a
lettered
german
speaking
to
me
once
of
his
year
of
military
service
told
me
that
had
it
lasted
but
a
month
or
two
longer
he
must
have
sought
release
in
suicide
i
know
very
well
that
my
own
courage
would
not
have
borne
me
to
the
end
of
the
twelvemonth
humiliation
resentment
loathing
would
have
goaded
me
to
madness
at
school
we
used
to
be
drilled
in
the
playground
once
a
week
i
have
but
to
think
of
it
even
after
forty
years
and
there
comes
back
upon
me
that
tremor
of
passionate
misery
which
at
the
time
often
made
me
ill
the
senseless
routine
of
mechanic
exercise
was
in
itself
all
but
unendurable
to
me
i
hated
the
standing
in
line
the
of
arms
and
legs
at
a
signal
the
thud
of
feet
stamping
in
constrained
unison
the
loss
of
individuality
seemed
to
me
sheer
disgrace
and
when
as
often
happened
the
rebuked
me
for
some
inefficiency
as
i
stood
in
line
when
he
addressed
me
as
number
seven
i
burned
with
shame
and
rage
i
was
no
longer
a
human
being
i
had
become
part
of
a
machine
and
my
name
was
number
seven
it
used
to
astonish
me
when
i
had
a
neighbour
who
went
through
the
drill
with
amusement
with
zealous
energy
i
would
gaze
at
the
boy
and
ask
myself
how
it
was
possible
that
he
and
i
should
feel
so
differently
to
be
sure
nearly
all
my
schoolfellows
either
enjoyed
the
thing
or
at
all
events
went
through
it
with
indifference
they
made
friends
with
the
sergeant
and
some
were
proud
of
walking
with
him
out
of
bounds
left
right
left
right
for
my
own
part
i
think
i
have
never
hated
man
as
i
hated
that
voiced
fellow
every
word
he
spoke
to
me
i
felt
as
an
insult
seeing
him
in
the
distance
i
have
turned
and
fled
to
escape
the
necessity
of
saluting
and
still
more
a
quiver
of
the
nerves
which
affected
me
so
painfully
if
ever
a
man
did
me
harm
it
was
he
harm
physical
and
moral
in
all
seriousness
i
believe
that
something
of
the
nervous
instability
from
which
i
have
suffered
since
boyhood
is
traceable
to
those
accursed
hours
of
drill
and
i
am
very
sure
that
i
can
date
from
the
same
wretched
moments
a
fierceness
of
personal
pride
which
has
been
one
of
my
most
troublesome
characteristics
the
disposition
of
course
was
there
it
should
have
been
modified
not
exacerbated
in
younger
manhood
it
would
have
flattered
me
to
think
that
i
alone
on
the
school
had
sensibility
enough
to
suffer
acutely
now
i
had
much
rather
feel
assured
that
many
of
my
schoolfellows
were
in
the
same
mind
of
subdued
revolt
even
of
those
who
boylike
enjoyed
their
drill
scarce
one
or
two
i
trust
would
have
welcomed
in
their
prime
of
life
the
imposition
of
military
servitude
upon
them
and
their
countrymen
from
a
certain
point
of
view
it
would
be
better
far
that
england
should
bleed
under
conquest
than
that
she
should
be
saved
by
eager
or
careless
acceptance
of
conscription
that
view
will
not
be
held
by
the
english
people
but
it
would
be
a
sorry
thing
for
england
if
the
day
came
when
no
one
of
those
who
love
her
harboured
such
a
thought
xx
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
one
might
define
art
as
an
expression
satisfying
and
abiding
of
the
zest
of
life
this
is
applicable
to
every
form
of
art
devised
by
man
for
in
his
creative
moment
whether
he
produce
a
great
drama
or
carve
a
piece
of
foliage
in
wood
the
artist
is
moved
and
inspired
by
supreme
enjoyment
of
some
aspect
of
the
world
about
him
an
enjoyment
in
itself
keener
than
that
experienced
by
another
man
and
intensified
prolonged
by
the
power
which
comes
to
him
we
know
not
how
of
recording
in
visible
or
audible
form
that
emotion
of
rare
vitality
art
in
some
degree
is
within
the
scope
of
every
human
being
were
he
but
the
ploughman
who
utters
a
few
melodious
notes
the
mere
outcome
of
health
and
strength
in
the
field
at
sunrise
he
sings
or
tries
to
prompted
by
an
unusual
gusto
in
being
and
the
rude
stave
is
all
his
own
another
was
he
who
also
at
the
plough
sang
of
the
daisy
of
the
or
shaped
the
rhythmic
tale
of
tam
o
shanter
not
only
had
life
a
zest
for
him
incalculably
stronger
and
subtler
than
that
which
stirs
the
soul
of
hodge
but
he
uttered
it
in
word
and
music
such
as
go
to
the
heart
of
mankind
and
hold
a
magic
power
for
ages
for
some
years
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
art
in
our
country
it
began
i
suspect
when
the
veritable
artistic
impulse
of
the
victorian
time
had
flagged
when
the
energy
of
a
great
time
was
all
but
exhausted
principles
always
become
a
matter
of
vehement
discussion
when
practice
is
at
ebb
not
by
taking
thought
does
one
become
an
artist
or
grow
even
an
inch
in
that
direction
which
is
not
at
all
the
same
as
saying
that
he
who
an
artist
can
not
profit
by
conscious
effort
goethe
the
example
so
often
urged
by
imitators
unlike
him
in
every
feature
of
humanity
took
thought
enough
about
his
faust
but
what
of
those
youthtime
lyrics
not
the
least
precious
of
his
achievements
which
were
scribbled
as
fast
as
pen
could
go
thwartwise
on
the
paper
because
he
could
not
stop
to
set
it
straight
dare
i
pen
even
for
my
own
eyes
the
venerable
truth
that
an
artist
is
born
and
not
made
it
seems
not
superfluous
in
times
which
have
heard
disdainful
criticism
of
scott
on
the
ground
that
he
had
no
artistic
conscience
that
he
scribbled
without
a
thought
of
style
that
he
never
elaborated
his
scheme
before
beginning
as
flaubert
of
course
you
know
invariably
did
why
after
all
has
one
not
heard
that
a
certain
william
shakespeare
turned
out
his
works
of
art
with
something
like
criminal
carelessness
is
it
not
a
fact
that
a
bungler
named
cervantes
was
so
little
in
earnest
about
his
art
that
having
in
one
chapter
described
the
stealing
of
donkey
he
presently
in
mere
forgetfulness
shows
us
sancho
riding
on
dapple
as
if
nothing
had
happened
does
not
one
thackeray
shamelessly
avow
on
the
last
page
of
a
grossly
subjective
novel
that
he
had
killed
lord
farintosh
mother
at
one
page
and
brought
her
to
life
again
at
another
these
sinners
against
art
are
none
the
less
among
the
supreme
artists
for
they
in
a
sense
in
a
degree
unintelligible
to
these
critics
of
theirs
and
their
work
is
an
expression
satisfying
and
abiding
of
the
zest
of
life
some
one
no
doubt
hit
upon
this
definition
of
mine
long
ago
it
does
matter
is
it
the
less
original
with
me
not
long
since
i
should
have
fretted
over
the
possibility
for
my
living
depended
on
an
avoidance
of
even
seeming
plagiarism
now
i
am
at
one
with
lord
foppington
and
much
disposed
to
take
pleasure
in
the
natural
sprouts
of
my
own
wit
without
troubling
whether
the
same
idea
has
occurred
to
others
suppose
me
in
total
ignorance
of
euclid
to
have
discovered
even
the
simplest
of
his
geometrical
demonstrations
shall
i
be
crestfallen
when
some
one
draws
attention
to
the
book
these
natural
sprouts
are
after
all
the
best
products
of
our
life
it
is
a
mere
accident
that
they
may
have
no
value
in
the
world
market
one
of
my
conscious
efforts
in
these
days
of
freedom
is
to
live
intellectually
for
myself
formerly
when
in
reading
i
came
upon
anything
that
impressed
or
delighted
me
down
it
went
in
my
for
use
i
could
not
read
a
striking
verse
or
sentence
of
prose
without
thinking
of
it
as
an
apt
quotation
in
something
i
might
write
one
of
the
evil
results
of
a
literary
life
now
that
i
strive
to
repel
this
habit
of
thought
i
find
myself
asking
to
what
end
then
do
i
read
and
remember
surely
as
foolish
a
question
as
ever
man
put
to
himself
you
read
for
your
own
pleasure
for
your
solace
and
strengthening
pleasure
then
purely
selfish
solace
which
endures
for
an
hour
and
strengthening
for
no
combat
ay
but
i
know
i
know
with
what
heart
should
i
live
here
in
my
cottage
waiting
for
life
end
were
it
not
for
those
hours
of
seeming
idle
reading
i
think
sometimes
how
good
it
were
had
i
some
one
by
me
to
listen
when
i
am
tempted
to
read
a
passage
aloud
yes
but
is
there
any
mortal
in
the
whole
world
upon
whom
i
could
invariably
depend
for
sympathetic
understanding
nay
who
would
even
generally
be
at
one
with
me
in
my
appreciation
such
harmony
of
intelligences
is
the
rarest
thing
all
through
life
we
long
for
it
the
desire
drives
us
like
a
demon
into
waste
places
too
often
ends
by
plunging
us
into
mud
and
morass
and
after
all
we
learn
that
the
vision
was
illusory
to
every
man
is
it
decreed
thou
shalt
live
alone
happy
they
who
imagine
that
they
have
escaped
the
common
lot
happy
whilst
they
imagine
it
those
to
whom
no
such
happiness
has
ever
been
granted
at
least
avoid
the
bitterest
of
disillusions
and
is
it
not
always
good
to
face
a
truth
however
discomfortable
the
mind
which
renounces
once
and
for
ever
a
futile
hope
has
its
compensation
in
calm
xxi
all
about
my
garden
the
birds
are
loud
to
say
that
the
air
is
filled
with
their
song
gives
no
idea
of
the
ceaseless
piping
whistling
trilling
which
at
moments
rings
to
heaven
in
a
triumphant
unison
a
wild
accord
now
and
then
i
notice
one
of
the
smaller
songsters
who
seems
to
strain
his
throat
in
a
madly
joyous
endeavour
to
all
the
rest
it
is
a
chorus
of
praise
such
as
none
other
of
earth
children
have
the
voice
or
the
heart
to
utter
as
i
listen
i
am
carried
away
by
its
glorious
rapture
my
being
melts
in
the
tenderness
of
an
impassioned
joy
my
eyes
are
dim
with
i
know
not
what
profound
humility
xxii
were
one
to
look
at
the
literary
journals
only
and
thereafter
judge
of
the
time
it
would
be
easy
to
persuade
oneself
that
civilization
had
indeed
made
great
and
solid
progress
and
that
the
world
stood
at
a
very
hopeful
stage
of
enlightenment
week

i

much
that

declares
itself
at
once
of
merely
ephemeral
import

even
of
no
import

what
masses

invite
the

note
that

an
inconspicuous
standing
in

of

public
taste
travel
on
the

is
largely
represented
the
general
appetite
for
information
about
lands
remote
would
appear
to
be
only
less
keen
than
for
the
adventures
of
romance
with
these
pages
before
one
eyes
must
one
not
needs
believe
that
things
of
the
mind
are
a
prime
concern
of
our
day
who
are
the
purchasers
of
these
volumes
ever
pouring
from
the
press
how
is
it
possible
for
so
great
a
commerce
to
flourish
save
as
a
consequence
of
national
eagerness
in
this
intellectual
domain
surely
one
must
take
for
granted
that
throughout
the
land
in
town
and
country
private
libraries
are
growing
apace
that
by
the
people
at
large
a
great
deal
of
time
is
devoted
to
reading
that
literary
ambition
is
one
of
the
commonest
spurs
to
effort
it
is
the
truth
all
this
may
be
said
of
contemporary
england
but
is
it
enough
to
set
one
mind
at
ease
regarding
the
outlook
of
our
civilization
two
things
must
be
remembered
however
considerable
this
literary
traffic
regarded
by
itself
it
is
relatively
of
small
extent
and
in
the
second
place
literary
activity
is
by
no
means
an
invariable
proof
of
that
mental
attitude
which
marks
the
truly
civilized
man
lay
aside
the
literary
organ
which
appears
once
a
week
and
take
up
the
newspaper
which
comes
forth
every
day
morning
and
evening
here
you
get
the
true
proportion
of
things
read
your
daily
that
which
costs
threepence
or
that
which
costs
a
halfpenny
and
muse
upon
the
impression
it
leaves
it
may
be
that
a
few
books
are
noticed
granting
that
the
notice
is
in
any
way
noticeable
compare
the
space
it
occupies
with
that
devoted
to
the
material
interests
of
life
you
have
a
gauge
of
the
real
importance
of
intellectual
endeavour
to
the
people
at
large
no
the
public
which
reads
in
any
sense
of
the
word
worth
considering
is
very
very
small
the
public
which
would
feel
no
lack
if
all
ceased
is
enormous
these
announcements
of
learned
works
which
strike
one
as
so
encouraging
are
addressed
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
a
few
thousand
persons
scattered
all
over
the
speaking
world
many
of
the
most
valuable
books
slowly
achieve
the
sale
of
a
few
hundred
copies
gather
from
all
the
ends
of
the
british
empire
the
men
and
women
who
purchase
grave
literature
as
a
matter
of
course
who
habitually
seek
it
in
public
libraries
in
short
who
regard
it
as
a
necessity
of
life
and
i
am
much
mistaken
if
they
could
not
comfortably
assemble
in
the
albert
hall
but
even
granting
this
is
it
not
an
obvious
fact
that
our
age
tends
to
the
civilized
habit
of
mind
as
displayed
in
a
love
for
intellectual
things
was
there
ever
a
time
which
saw
the
literature
of
knowledge
and
of
the
emotions
so
widely
distributed
does
not
the
minority
of
the
truly
intelligent
exercise
a
vast
and
profound
influence
does
it
not
in
truth
lead
the
way
however
slowly
and
irregularly
the
multitude
may
follow
i
should
like
to
believe
it
when
gloomy
evidence
is
thrust
upon
me
i
often
say
to
myself
think
of
the
frequency
of
the
reasonable
man
think
of
him
everywhere
labouring
to
spread
the
light
how
is
it
possible
that
such
efforts
should
be
overborne
by
forces
of
blind
brutality
now
that
the
human
race
has
got
so
far
yes
yes
but
this
mortal
whom
i
caress
as
reasonable
as
enlightened
and
enlightening
this
author
investigator
lecturer
or
studious
gentleman
to
whose
i
cling
does
he
always
represent
justice
and
peace
sweetness
of
manners
purity
of
life
all
the
things
which
makes
for
true
civilization
here
is
a
fallacy
of
bookish
thought
experience
offers
proof
on
every
hand
that
vigorous
mental
life
may
be
but
one
side
of
a
personality
of
which
the
other
is
moral
barbarism
a
man
may
be
a
fine
archaeologist
and
yet
have
no
sympathy
with
human
ideals
the
historian
the
biographer
even
the
poet
may
be
a
gambler
a
social
toady
a
clamorous
chauvinist
or
an
unscrupulous
as
for
leaders
of
science
what
optimist
will
dare
to
proclaim
them
on
the
side
of
the
gentle
virtues
and
if
one
must
needs
think
in
this
way
of
those
who
stand
forth
professed
instructors
and
inspirers
what
of
those
who
merely
listen
the
oh
the
hardly
will
a
prudent
statistician
venture
to
declare
that
one
in
every

of
those
who
actually
read
sterling
books

so
with
comprehension
of
their

so
seemingly
wide
an
acceptance

who

them

those

their

even
to
flatter
themselves

of

those
who
are
merely
pleased
by
the
outer

in

that

clang
by
roar
and
shriek
and
when
my
first
sense
on
returning
to
consciousness
was
hatred
of
the
life
about
me
noises
of
wood
and
metal
clattering
of
wheels
banging
of
implements
jangling
of
bells
all
such
things
are
bad
enough
but
worse
still
is
the
clamorous
human
voice
nothing
on
earth
is
more
irritating
to
me
than
a
bellow
or
scream
of
idiot
mirth
nothing
more
hateful
than
a
shout
or
yell
of
brutal
anger
were
it
possible
i
would
never
again
hear
the
utterance
of
a
human
tongue
save
from
those
few
who
are
dear
to
me
here
wake
at
what
hour
i
may
early
or
late
i
lie
amid
gracious
stillness
perchance
a
horse
hoof
rings
rhythmically
upon
the
road
perhaps
a
dog
barks
from
a
neighbour
farm
it
may
be
that
there
comes
the
far
soft
murmur
of
a
train
from
the
other
side
of
exe
but
these
are
almost
the
only
sounds
that
could
force
themselves
upon
my
ear
a
voice
at
any
time
of
the
day
is
the
rarest
thing
but
there
is
the
rustle
of
branches
in
the
morning
breeze
there
is
the
music
of
a
sunny
shower
against
the
window
there
is
the
matin
song
of
birds
several
times
lately
i
have
lain
wakeful
when
there
sounded
the
first
note
of
the
earliest
lark
it
makes
me
almost
glad
of
my
restless
nights
the
only
trouble
that
touches
me
in
these
moments
is
the
thought
of
my
long
life
wasted
amid
the
senseless
noises
of
man
world
year
after
year
this
spot
has
known
the
same
tranquillity
with
ever
so
little
of
good
fortune
with
ever
so
little
wisdom
beyond
what
was
granted
me
i
might
have
blessed
my
manhood
with
calm
might
have
made
for
myself
in
later
life
a
long
retrospect
of
bowered
peace
as
it
is
i
enjoy
with
something
of
sadness
remembering
that
this
melodious
silence
is
but
the
prelude
of
that
deeper
stillness
which
waits
to
enfold
us
all
xxiv
morning
after
morning
of
late
i
have
taken
my
walk
in
the
same
direction
my
purpose
being
to
look
at
a
plantation
of
young
larches
there
is
no
lovelier
colour
on
earth
than
that
in
which
they
are
now
clad
it
seems
to
refresh
as
well
as
gladden
my
eyes
and
its
influence
sinks
deep
into
my
heart
too
soon
it
will
change
already
i
think
the
first
radiant
verdure
has
begun
to
pass
into
summer
soberness
the
larch
has
its
moment
of
unmatched
beauty
and
well
for
him
whose
chance
permits
him
to
enjoy
it
spring
after
spring
could
anything
be
more
wonderful
than
the
fact
that
here
am
i
day
by
day
not
only
at
leisure
to
walk
forth
and
gaze
at
the
larches
but
blessed
with
the
tranquillity
of
mind
needful
for
such
enjoyment
on
any
morning
of
spring
sunshine
how
many
mortals
find
themselves
so
much
at
peace
that
they
are
able
to
give
themselves
wholly
to
delight
in
the
glory
of
heaven
and
of
earth
is
it
the
case
with
one
man
in
every
fifty
thousand
consider
what
extraordinary
kindness
of
fate
must
tend
upon
one
that
not
a
care
not
a
preoccupation
should
interfere
with
his
contemplative
thought
for
five
or
six
days
successively
so
rooted
in
the
human
mind
and
so
reasonably
rooted
is
the
belief
in
an
envious
power
that
i
ask
myself
whether
i
shall
not
have
to
pay
by
some
disaster
for
this
period
of
sacred
calm
for
a
week
or
so
i
have
been
one
of
a
small
number
chosen
out
of
the
whole
human
race
by
supreme
benediction
it
may
be
that
this
comes
to
every
one
in
turn
to
most
it
can
only
be
once
in
a
lifetime
and
so
briefly
that
my
own
lot
seems
so
much
better
than
that
of
ordinary
men
sometimes
makes
me
fearful
xxv
walking
in
a
favourite
lane
i
found
it
covered
with
shed
blossoms
of
the
hawthorn
creamy
white
fragrant
even
in
ruin
lay
scattered
the
glory
of
the
may
it
told
me
that
spring
is
over
have
i
enjoyed
it
as
i
should
since
the
day
that
brought
me
freedom
four
times
have
i
seen
the
year
new
birth
and
always
as
the
violet
yielded
to
the
rose
i
have
known
a
fear
that
i
had
not
sufficiently
prized
this
boon
of
heaven
whilst
it
was
with
me
many
hours
i
have
spent
shut
up
among
my
books
when
i
might
have
been
in
the
meadows
was
the
gain
equivalent
doubtfully
diffidently
i
hearken
what
the
mind
can
plead
i
recall
my
moments
of
delight
the
recognition
of
each
flower
that
unfolded
the
surprise
of
budding
branches
clothed
in
a
night
with
green
the
first
snowy
gleam
upon
the
blackthorn
did
not
escape
me
by
its
familiar
bank
i
watched
for
the
earliest
primrose
and
in
its
copse
i
found
the
anemone
meadows
shining
with
buttercups
hollows
sunned
with
the
marsh
marigold
held
me
long
at
gaze
i
saw
the
sallow
glistening
with
its
cones
of
silvery
fur
and
splendid
with
dust
of
gold
these
common
things
touch
me
with
more
of
admiration
and
of
wonder
each
time
i
behold
them
they
are
once
more
gone
as
i
turn
to
summer
a
misgiving
mingles
with
my
joy
summer
as
i
was
reading
in
the
garden
a
waft
of
summer
perfume
some
hidden
link
of
association
in
what
i
read
i
know
not
what
it
may
have
been
took
me
back
to
holidays
i
recovered
with
strange
intensity
that
lightsome
mood
of
long
release
from
tasks
of
going
away
to
the
seaside
which
is
one
of
childhood
blessings
i
was
in
the
train
no
rushing
express
such
as
bears
you
great
distances
the
sober
train
which
goes
to
no
place
of
importance
which
lets
you
see
the
white
steam
of
the
engine
float
and
fall
upon
a
meadow
ere
you
pass
thanks
to
a
good
and
wise
father
we
youngsters
saw
nothing
of
seaside
places
where
crowds
assemble
i
am
speaking
too
of
a
time
more
than
forty
years
ago
when
it
was
still
possible
to
find
on
the
coasts
of
northern
england
east
or
west
spots
known
only
to
those
who
loved
the
shore
for
its
beauty
and
its
solitude
at
every
station
the
train
stopped
little
stations
decked
with
beds
of
flowers
smelling
warm
in
the
sunshine
where
got
in
with
baskets
and
talked
in
an
unfamiliar
dialect
an
english
which
to
us
sounded
almost
like
a
foreign
tongue
then
the
first
glimpse
of
the
sea
the
excitement
of
noting
whether
tide
was
high
or
low
stretches
of
sand
and
weedy
pools
or
halcyon
wavelets
frothing
at
their
furthest
reach
under
the
starred
with
convolvulus
of
a
sudden
station
ah
that
taste
of
the
brine
on
a
child
lips
nowadays
i
can
take
holiday
when
i
will
and
go
whithersoever
it
pleases
me
but
that
salt
kiss
of
the
sea
air
i
shall
never
know
again
my
senses
are
dulled
i
can
not
get
so
near
to
nature
i
have
a
sorry
dread
of
her
clouds
her
winds
and
must
walk
with
tedious
circumspection
where
once
i
ran
and
leapt
exultingly
were
it
possible
but
for
one
to
plunge
and
bask
in
the
sunny
surf
to
roll
on
the
silvery
to
leap
from
rock
to
rock
on
shining
laughing
if
i
slipped
into
the
shallows
among
starfish
and
anemones
i
am
much
older
in
body
than
in
mind
i
can
but
look
at
what
i
once
enjoyed
ii
i
have
been
spending
a
week
in
somerset
the
right
june
weather
put
me
in
the
mind
for
rambling
and
my
thoughts
turned
to
the
severn
sea
i
went
to
glastonbury
and
wells
and
on
to
cheddar
and
so
to
the
shore
of
the
channel
at
clevedon
remembering
my
holiday
of
fifteen
years
ago
and
too
often
losing
myself
in
a
contrast
of
the
man
i
was
then
and
what
i
am
now
beautiful
beyond
all
words
of
description
that
nook
of
oldest
england
but
that
i
feared
the
moist
and
misty
winter
climate
i
should
have
chosen
some
spot
below
the
mendips
for
my
home
and
unspeakable
the
charm
to
my
ear
of
those
old
names
exquisite
the
quiet
of
those
little
towns
lost
amid
tilth
and
pasture
untouched
as
yet
by
the
fury
of
modern
life
their
ancient
sanctuaries
guarded
as
it
were
by
noble
trees
and
hedges
overrun
with
flowers
in
all
england
there
is
no
sweeter
and
more
varied
prospect
than
that
from
the
hill
of
the
holy
thorn
at
glastonbury
in
all
england
there
is
no
lovelier
musing
place
than
the
leafy
walk
beside
the
palace
moat
at
wells
as
i
think
of
the
golden
hours
i
spent
there
a
passion
to
which
i
can
give
no
name
takes
hold
upon
me
my
heart
trembles
with
an
indefinable
ecstasy
there
was
a
time
of
my
life
when
i
was
consumed
with
a
desire
for
foreign
travel
an
impatience
of
everything
familiar
fretted
me
through
all
the
changing
year
if
i
had
not
at
length
found
the
opportunity
to
escape
if
i
had
not
seen
the
landscapes
for
which
my
soul
longed
i
think
i
must
have
moped
to
death
few
men
assuredly
have
enjoyed
such
wanderings
more
than
i
and
few
men
revive
them
in
memory
with
a
richer
delight
or
deeper
longing
but
whatever
temptation
comes
to
me
in
mellow
autumn
when
i
think
of
the
grape
and
of
the
olive
i
do
not
believe
i
shall
ever
again
cross
the
sea
what
remains
to
me
of
life
and
of
energy
is
far
too
little
for
the
enjoyment
of
all
i
know
and
all
i
wish
to
know
of
this
dear
island
as
a
child
i
used
to
sleep
in
a
room
hung
round
with
prints
after
english
landscape
painters
those
steel
engravings
so
common
half
a
century
ago
which
bore
the
legend
from
the
picture
in
the
vernon
gallery
far
more
than
i
knew
at
the
time
these
pictures
impressed
me
i
gazed
and
gazed
at
them
with
that
fixed
attention
of
a
child
which
is
half
curiosity
half
reverie
till
every
line
of
them
was
fixed
in
my
mind
at
this
moment
i
see
the
landscapes
as
if
they
were
hanging
on
the
wall
before
me
and
i
have
often
thought
that
this
early
training
of
the
imagination
for
such
it
was
has
much
to
do
with
the
passionate
love
of
rural
scenery
which
lurked
within
me
even
when
i
did
not
recognize
it
and
which
now
for
many
a
year
has
been
one
of
the
emotions
directing
my
life
perhaps
too
that
early
memory
explains
why
i
love
a
good
print
even
more
than
a
good
painting
and
to
draw
yet
another
inference
here
may
be
a
reason
for
the
fact
that
through
my
youth
and
early
manhood
i
found
more
pleasure
in
nature
as
represented
by
art
than
in
nature
herself
even
during
that
strange
time
when
hardships
and
passions
held
me
captive
far
from
any
glimpse
of
the
flowering
earth
i
could
be
moved
and
moved
deeply
by
a
picture
of
the
simplest
rustic
scene
at
rare
moments
when
a
happy
chance
led
me
into
the
national
gallery
i
used
to
stand
long
before
such
pictures
as
the
valley
farm
the
cornfield
mousehold
heath
in
the
murk
confusion
of
my
heart
these
visions
of
the
world
of
peace
and
beauty
from
which
i
was
excluded
to
which
indeed
i
hardly
ever
gave
a
thought
touched
me
to
deep
emotion
but
it
did
not
need
nor
does
it
now
the
magic
of
a
master
to
awake
that
mood
in
me
let
me
but
come
upon
the
poorest
little
woodcut
the
cheapest
process
illustration
representing
a
thatched
cottage
a
lane
a
field
and
i
hear
that
music
begin
to
murmur
it
is
a
passion
heaven
be
thanked
that
grows
with
my
advancing
years
the
last
thought
of
my
brain
as
i
lie
dying
will
be
that
of
sunshine
upon
an
english
meadow
iii
sitting
in
my
garden
amid
the
evening
scent
of
roses
i
have
read
through
walton
of
could
any
place
and
time
have
been
more
appropriate
almost
within
sight
is
the
tower
of
heavitree
church
heavitree
which
was
hooker
birthplace
in
other
parts
of
england
he
must
often
have
thought
of
these
meadows
falling
to
the
green
valley
of
the
exe
and
of
the
sun
setting
behind
the
pines
of
haldon
hooker
loved
the
country
delightful
to
me
and
infinitely
touching
is
that
request
of
his
to
be
transferred
from
london
to
a
rural
living
where
i
can
see
god
blessing
spring
out
of
the
earth
and
that
glimpse
of
him
where
he
was
found
tending
sheep
with
a
horace
in
his
hand
it
was
in
rural
solitudes
that
he
conceived
the
rhythm
of
mighty
prose
what
music
of
the
spheres
sang
to
that
poor
man
the
last
few
pages
i
read
by
the
light
of
the
full
moon
that
of
afterglow
having
till
then
sufficed
me
oh
why
has
it
not
been
granted
me
in
all
my
long
years
of
to
write
something
small
and
perfect
even
as
one
of
these
lives
of
honest
izaak
here
is
literature
look
you
not
literary
work
let
me
be
thankful
that
i
have
the
mind
to
enjoy
it
not
only
to
understand
but
to
savour
its
great
goodness
iv
it
is
sunday
morning
and
above
earth
beauty
shines
the
purest
softest
sky
this
summer
has
yet
gladdened
us
withal
my
window
is
thrown
open
i
see
the
sunny
gleam
upon
garden
leaves
and
flowers
i
hear
the
birds
whose
wont
it
is
to
sing
to
me
ever
and
anon
the
martins
that
have
their
home
beneath
my
eaves
sweep
past
in
silence
church
bells
have
begun
to
chime
i
know
the
music
of
their
voices
near
and
far
there
was
a
time
when
it
delighted
me
to
flash
my
satire
on
the
english
sunday
i
could
see
nothing
but
antiquated
foolishness
and
modern
hypocrisy
in
this
weekly
pause
from
labour
and
from
bustle
now
i
prize
it
as
an
inestimable
boon
and
dread
every
encroachment
upon
its
restful
stillness
scoff
as
i
might
at
sabbatarianism
was
i
not
always
glad
when
sunday
came
the
bells
of
london
churches
and
chapels
are
not
soothing
to
the
ear
but
when
i
remember
their
sound
even
that
of
the
most
aggressively
pharisaic
conventicle
with
its
one
dire
clapper
i
find
it
associated
with
a
sense
of
repose
of
liberty
this
day
of
the
seven
i
granted
to
my
better
genius
work
was
put
aside
and
when
heaven
permitted
trouble
forgotten
when
out
of
england
i
have
always
missed
this
sunday
quietude
this
difference
from
ordinary
days
which
seems
to
affect
the
very
atmosphere
it
is
not
enough
that
people
should
go
to
church
that
shops
should
be
closed
and
workyards
silent
these
holiday
notes
do
not
make
a
sunday
think
as
one
may
of
its
significance
our
day
of
rest
has
a
peculiar
sanctity
felt
i
imagine
in
a
more
or
less
vague
way
even
by
those
who
wish
to
see
the
village
lads
at
cricket
and
theatres
open
in
the
town
the
idea
is
surely
as
good
a
one
as
ever
came
to
mortals
let
one
whole
day
in
every
week
be
removed
from
the
common
life
of
the
world
lifted
above
common
pleasures
as
above
common
cares
with
all
the
abuses
of
fanaticism
this
thought
remained
rich
in
blessings
sunday
has
always
brought
large
good
to
the
generality
and
to
a
chosen
number
has
been
the
very
life
of
the
soul
however
heretically
some
of
them
understood
the
words
if
its
ancient
use
perish
from
among
us
so
much
the
worse
for
our
country
and
perish
no
doubt
it
will
only
here
in
rustic
solitude
can
one
forget
the
changes
that
have
already
made
the
day
less
sacred
to
multitudes
with
it
will
vanish
that
habit
of
periodic
calm
which
even
when
it
has
become
so
largely
void
of
conscious
meaning
is
one
may
safely
say
the
best
spiritual
boon
ever
bestowed
upon
a
people
the
most
difficult
of
all
things
to
attain
the
most
difficult
of
all
to
preserve
the
supreme
benediction
of
the
noblest
mind
this
calm
was
once
breathed
over
the
whole
land
as
often
as
sounded
the
last
stroke
of
weekly
toil
on
saturday
at
even
began
the
quiet
and
the
solace
with
the
decline
of
old
faith
sunday
can
not
but
lose
its
sanction
and
no
loss
among
the
innumerable
that
we
are
suffering
will
work
so
effectually
for
popular
vulgarization
what
hope
is
there
of
guarding
the
moral
beauty
of
the
day
when
the
authority
which
set
it
apart
is
no
longer
recognized
imagine
a
once
a
week
on
sunday
i
come
down
later
than
usual
i
make
a
change
of
dress
for
it
is
fitting
that
the
day
of
spiritual
rest
should
lay
aside
the
livery
of
the
laborious
week
for
me
indeed
there
is
no
labour
at
any
time
but
nevertheless
does
sunday
bring
me
repose
i
share
in
the
common
tranquillity
my
thought
escapes
the
workaday
world
more
completely
than
on
other
days
it
is
not
easy
to
see
how
this
house
of
mine
can
make
to
itself
a
sunday
quiet
for
at
all
times
it
is
soundless
yet
i
find
a
difference
my
housekeeper
comes
into
the
room
with
her
sunday
smile
she
is
happier
for
the
day
and
the
sight
of
her
happiness
gives
me
pleasure
she
speaks
if
possible
in
a
softer
voice
she
wears
a
garment
which
reminds
me
that
there
is
only
the
lightest
and
cleanest
housework
to
be
done
she
will
go
to
church
morning
and
evening
and
i
know
that
she
is
better
for
it
during
her
absence
i
sometimes
look
into
rooms
which
on
other
days
i
never
enter
it
is
merely
to
gladden
my
eyes
with
the
shining
cleanliness
the
perfect
order
i
am
sure
to
find
in
the
good
woman
domain
but
for
that
spotless
and
kitchen
what
would
it
avail
me
to
range
my
books
and
hang
my
pictures
all
the
tranquillity
of
my
life
depends
upon
the
honest
care
of
this
woman
who
lives
and
works
unseen
and
i
am
sure
that
the
money
i
pay
her
is
the
least
part
of
her
reward
she
is
such
an
person
that
the
mere
discharge
of
what
she
deems
a
duty
is
in
itself
an
end
to
her
and
the
work
of
her
hands
in
itself
a
satisfaction
a
pride
when
a
child
i
was
permitted
to
handle
on
sunday
certain
books
which
could
not
be
exposed
to
the
more
careless
usage
of
common
days
volumes
finely
illustrated
or
the
more
handsome
editions
of
familiar
authors
or
works
which
merely
by
their
bulk
demanded
special
care
happily
these
books
were
all
of
the
higher
rank
in
literature
and
so
there
came
to
be
established
in
my
mind
an
association
between
the
day
of
rest
and
names
which
are
the
greatest
in
verse
and
prose
through
my
life
this
habit
has
remained
with
me
i
have
always
wished
to
spend
some
part
of
the
sunday
quiet
with
books
which
at
most
times
it
is
fatally
easy
to
leave
aside
one
very
knowledge
and
love
of
them
serving
as
an
excuse
for
their
neglect
in
favour
of
print
which
has
the
attraction
of
newness
homer
and
virgil
milton
and
shakespeare
not
many
sundays
have
gone
by
without
my
opening
one
or
other
of
these
not
many
sundays
nay
that
is
to
exaggerate
as
one
has
the
habit
of
doing
let
me
say
rather
that
on
many
a
i
have
found
mind
and
opportunity
for
such
reading
nowadays
mind
and
opportunity
fail
me
never
i
may
take
down
my
homer
or
my
shakespeare
when
i
choose
but
it
is
still
on
sunday
that
i
feel
it
most
becoming
to
seek
the
privilege
of
their
companionship
for
these
great
ones
crowned
with
immortality
do
not
respond
to
him
who
approaches
them
as
though
hurried
by
temporal
care
there
befits
the
garment
of
solemn
leisure
the
thought
attuned
to
peace
i
open
the
volume
somewhat
formally
is
it
not
sacred
if
the
word
have
any
meaning
at
all
and
as
i
read
no
interruption
can
befall
me
the
note
of
a
linnet
the
humming
of
a
bee
these
are
the
sounds
about
my
sanctuary
the
page
scarce
rustles
as
it
turns
vi
of
how
many
dwellings
can
it
be
said
that
no
word
of
anger
is
ever
heard
beneath
its
roof
and
that
no
unkindly
feeling
ever
exists
between
the
inmates
most
men
experience
would
seem
to
justify
them
in
declaring
that
throughout
the
inhabited
world
no
such
house
exists
i
knowing
at
all
events
of
one
admit
the
possibility
that
there
may
be
more
yet
i
feel
that
it
is
to
hazard
a
conjecture
i
can
not
point
with
certainty
to
any
other
instance
nor
in
all
my
secular
life
i
speak
as
one
who
has
quitted
the
world
could
i
have
named
a
single
example
it
is
so
difficult
for
human
beings
to
live
together
nay
it
is
so
difficult
for
them
to
associate
however
transitorily
and
even
under
the
most
favourable
conditions
without
some
shadow
of
mutual
offence
consider
the
differences
of
task
and
of
habit
the
conflict
of
prejudices
the
divergence
of
opinions
though
that
is
probably
the
same
thing
which
quickly
reveal
themselves
between
any
two
persons
brought
into
more
than
casual
contact
and
think
how
much
is
implicit
whenever
for
more
than
an
hour
or
two
they
in
seeming
harmony
man
is
not
made
for
peaceful
intercourse
with
his
fellows
he
is
by
nature
commonly
aggressive
always
critical
in
a
more
or
less
hostile
spirit
of
any
characteristic
which
seems
strange
to
him
that
he
is
capable
of
profound
affections
merely
modifies
here
and
there
his
natural
contentiousness
and
subdues
its
expression
even
love
in
the
largest
and
purest
sense
of
the
word
is
no
safeguard
against
perilous
irritation
and
sensibilities
inborn
and
what
were
the
durability
of
love
without
the
powerful
alliance
of
habit
suppose
yourself
endowed
with
such
power
of
hearing
that
all
the
talk
going
on
at
any
moment
beneath
the
domestic
roofs
of
any
town
became
clearly
audible
to
you
the
dominant
note
would
be
that
of
moods
tempers
opinions
at
jar
who
but
the
most
amiable
dreamer
can
doubt
it
this
mind
you
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
angry
emotion
is
the
ruling
force
in
human
life
the
facts
of
our
civilization
prove
the
contrary
just
because
and
only
because
the
natural
spirit
of
conflict
finds
such
frequent
scope
does
human
society
hold
together
and
on
the
whole
present
a
pacific
aspect
in
the
course
of
ages
one
would
like
to
know
how
many
man
has
attained
a
remarkable
degree
of
dire
experience
has
forced
upon
him
the
necessity
of
compromise
and
habit
has
inclined
him
the
individual
to
prefer
a
quiet
orderly
life
but
by
instinct
he
is
still
a
quarrelsome
creature
and
he
gives
vent
to
the
impulse
as
far
as
it
is
compatible
with
his
reasoned
interests
often
to
be
sure
without
regard
for
that
limit
the
average
man
or
woman
is
always
at
open
discord
with
some
one
the
great
majority
could
not
live
without
squabble
speak
in
confidence
with
any
one
you
like
and
get
him
to
tell
you
how
many
cases
of
coldness
alienation
or
downright
enmity
between
friends
and
kinsfolk
his
memory
registers
the
number
will
be
considerable
and
what
a
vastly
greater
number
of
everyday
misunderstandings
may
be
thence
inferred
verbal
contention
is
of
course
commoner
among
the
poor
and
the
vulgar
than
in
the
class
of
bred
people
living
at
their
ease
but
i
doubt
whether
the
lower
ranks
of
society
find
personal
association
much
more
difficult
than
the
refined
minority
above
them
high
cultivation
may
help
to
but
it
multiplies
the
chances
of
irritative
contact
in
mansion
as
in
hovel
the
strain
of
life
is
perpetually
felt
between
the
married
between
parents
and
children
between
relatives
of
every
degree
between
employers
and
employed
they
debate
they
dispute
they
wrangle
they
explode
then
nerves
are
relieved
and
they
are
ready
to
begin
over
again
quit
the
home
and
quarrelling
is
less
obvious
but
it
goes
on
all
about
one
what
proportion
of
the
letters
delivered
any
morning
would
be
found
to
be
written
in
displeasure
in
petulance
in
wrath
the
postbag
shrieks
insults
or
bursts
with
suppressed
malice
is
it
not
wonderful
nay
is
it
not
the
marvel
of
marvels
that
human
life
has
reached
such
a
high
point
of
public
and
private
organization
and
gentle
idealists
utter
their
indignant
wonder
at
the
continuance
of
war
why
it
passes
the
wit
of
man
to
explain
how
it
is
that
nations
are
ever
at
peace
for
if
only
by
the
rarest
good
fortune
do
individuals
associate
harmoniously
there
would
seem
to
be
much
less
likelihood
of
mutual
understanding
and
between
the
peoples
of
alien
lands
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
two
nations
are
ever
friendly
in
the
sense
of
truly
liking
each
other
with
the
reciprocal
criticism
of
countries
there
always
mingles
a
sentiment
of
animosity
the
original
meaning
of
is
merely
stranger
and
a
stranger
who
is
likewise
a
foreigner
will
only
by
curious
exception
fail
to
stir
antipathy
in
the
average
human
being
add
to
this
that
a
great
number
of
persons
in
every
country
find
their
delight
and
their
business
in
exasperating
international
disrelish
and
with
what
vestige
of
common
sense
can
one
feel
surprise
that
war
is
ceaselessly
talked
of
often
enough
declared
in
days
gone
by
distance
and
rarity
of
communication
assured
peace
between
many
realms
now
that
every
country
is
in
proximity
to
every
other
what
need
is
there
to
elaborate
explanations
of
the
distrust
the
fear
the
hatred
which
are
a
perpetual
theme
of
journalists
and
statesmen
by
approximation
all
countries
have
entered
the
sphere
of
natural
quarrel
that
they
find
plenty
of
things
to
quarrel
about
is
no
cause
for
astonishment
a
hundred
years
hence
there
will
be
some
possibility
of
perceiving
whether
international
relations
are
likely
to
obey
the
law
which
has
acted
with
such
beneficence
in
the
life
of
each
civilized
people
whether
this
country
and
that
will
be
content
to
ease
their
tempers
with
bloodless
squabbling
subduing
the
more
violent
promptings
for
the
common
good
yet
i
suspect
that
a
century
is
a
very
short
time
to
allow
for
even
justifiable
surmise
of
such
an
outcome
if
by
any
chance
newspapers
ceased
to
exist
talk
of
war
and
one
gets
involved
in
such
utopian
musings
vii
i
have
been
reading
one
of
those
prognostic
articles
on
international
politics
which
every
now
and
then
appear
in
the
reviews
why
i
should
so
waste
my
time
it
would
be
hard
to
say
i
suppose
the
fascination
of
disgust
and
fear
gets
the
better
of
me
in
a
moment
idleness
this
writer
who
is
horribly
perspicacious
and
vigorous
demonstrates
the
certainty
of
a
great
european
war
and
regards
it
with
the
peculiar
satisfaction
excited
by
such
things
in
a
certain
order
of
mind
his
phrases
about
dire
calamity
and
so
on
mean
nothing
the
whole
tenor
of
his
writing
proves
that
he
represents
and
consciously
one
of
the
forces
which
go
to
bring
war
about
his
part
in
the
business
is
a
fluent
irresponsibility
which
casts
scorn
on
all
who
reluct
at
the
inevitable
persistent
prophecy
is
a
familiar
way
of
assuring
the
event
but
i
will
read
no
more
such
writing
this
resolution
i
make
and
will
keep
why
set
my
nerves
quivering
with
rage
and
spoil
the
calm
of
a
whole
day
when
no
good
of
any
sort
can
come
of
it
what
is
it
to
me
if
nations
fall
each
other
let
the
fools
go
to
it
why
should
they
not
please
themselves
peace
after
all
is
the
aspiration
of
the
few
so
it
always
was
and
ever
will
be
but
have
done
with
the
nauseous
cant
about
dire
calamity
the
leaders
and
the
multitude
hold
no
such
view
either
they
see
in
war
a
direct
and
tangible
profit
or
they
are
driven
to
it
with
heads
down
by
the
brute
that
is
in
them
let
them
rend
and
be
rent
let
them
paddle
in
blood
and
viscera
till
if
that
would
ever
happen
their
stomachs
turn
let
them
blast
the
cornfield
and
the
orchard
fire
the
home
for
all
that
there
will
yet
be
found
some
silent
few
who
go
their
way
amid
the
still
meadows
who
bend
to
the
flower
and
watch
the
sunset
and
these
alone
are
worth
a
thought
viii
in
this
hot
weather
i
like
to
walk
at
times
amid
the
full
glow
of
the
sun
our
island
sun
is
never
hot
beyond
endurance
and
there
is
a
magnificence
in
the
triumph
of
high
summer
which
exalts
one
mind
among
streets
it
is
hard
to
bear
yet
even
there
for
those
who
have
eyes
to
see
it
the
splendour
of
the
sky
lends
beauty
to
things
in
themselves
mean
or
hideous
i
remember
an
august
when
having
for
some
reason
to
walk
all
across
london
i
unexpectedly
found
myself
enjoying
the
strange
desertion
of
great
streets
and
from
that
passed
to
surprise
in
the
sense
of
something
beautiful
a
charm
in
the
vulgar
vista
in
the
dull
architecture
which
i
had
never
known
deep
and
marked
shadows
such
as
one
only
sees
on
a
few
days
of
summer
are
in
themselves
very
impressive
and
become
more
so
when
they
fall
upon
highways
devoid
of
folk
i
remember
observing
as
something
new
the
shape
of
familiar
edifices
of
spires
monuments
and
when
at
length
i
sat
down
somewhere
on
the
embankment
it
was
rather
to
gaze
at
leisure
than
to
rest
for
i
felt
no
weariness
and
the
sun
still
pouring
upon
me
its
noontide
radiance
seemed
to
fill
my
veins
with
life
that
sense
i
shall
never
know
again
for
me
nature
has
comforts
raptures
but
no
more
invigoration
the
sun
keeps
me
alive
but
can
not
as
in
the
old
days
renew
my
being
i
would
fain
learn
to
enjoy
without
reflecting
my
walk
in
the
golden
hours
leads
me
to
a
great
whose
root
offers
a
convenient
seat
in
the
shadow
of
its
foliage
at
that
i
have
no
wide
view
before
me
but
what
i
see
is
enough
a
corner
of
waste
land
with
poppies
and
charlock
on
the
edge
of
a
field
of
corn
the
brilliant
red
and
yellow
harmonize
with
the
glory
of
the
day
near
by
too
is
a
hedge
covered
with
great
white
blooms
of
the
bindweed
my
eyes
do
not
soon
grow
weary
a
little
plant
of
which
i
am
very
fond
is
the
when
the
sun
is
hot
upon
it
the
flower
gives
forth
a
strangely
aromatic
scent
very
delightful
to
me
i
know
the
cause
of
this
peculiar
pleasure
the
harrow
sometimes
grows
in
sandy
ground
above
the
seashore
in
my
childhood
i
have
many
a
time
lain
in
such
a
spot
under
the
glowing
sky
and
though
i
scarce
thought
of
it
perceived
the
odour
of
the
little
flower
when
it
touched
my
face
now
i
have
but
to
smell
it
and
those
hours
come
back
again
i
see
the
shore
of
cumberland
running
north
to
bee
head
on
the
sea
horizon
a
faint
shape
which
is
the
isle
of
man
inland
the
mountains
which
for
me
at
that
time
guarded
a
region
of
unknown
wonder
ah
how
long
ago
ix
i
read
much
less
than
i
used
to
do
i
think
much
more
yet
what
is
the
use
of
thought
which
can
no
longer
serve
to
direct
life
better
perhaps
to
read
and
read
incessantly
losing
one
futile
self
in
the
activity
of
other
minds
this
summer
i
have
taken
up
no
new
book
but
have
renewed
my
acquaintance
with
several
old
ones
which
i
had
not
opened
for
many
a
year
one
or
two
have
been
books
such
as
mature
men
rarely
read
at
all
books
which
it
is
one
habit
to
take
as
read
to
presume
sufficiently
known
to
speak
of
but
never
to
open
thus
one
day
my
hand
fell
upon
the
the
little
oxford
edition
which
i
used
at
school
with
its
boyish
on
the
its
blots
and
underlinings
and
marginal
scrawls
to
my
shame
i
possess
no
other
edition
yet
this
is
a
book
one
would
like
to
have
in
beautiful
form
i
opened
it
i
began
to
read
a
ghost
of
boyhood
stirring
in
my
heart
and
from
chapter
to
chapter
was
led
on
until
after
a
few
days
i
had
read
the
whole
i
am
glad
this
happened
in
the
i
like
to
link
childhood
with
these
latter
days
and
no
better
way
could
i
have
found
than
this
return
to
a
which
even
as
a
was
my
great
delight
by
some
trick
of
memory
i
always
associate
work
on
the
classics
with
a
sense
of
warm
and
sunny
days
rain
and
gloom
and
a
chilly
atmosphere
must
have
been
far
the
more
frequent
conditions
but
these
things
are
forgotten
my
old
liddell
and
scott
still
serves
me
and
if
in
opening
it
i
bend
close
enough
to
catch
the
of
the
leaves
i
am
back
again
at
that
day
of
boyhood
noted
on
the
by
the
hand
of
one
long
dead
when
the
book
was
new
and
i
used
it
for
the
first
time
it
was
a
day
of
summer
and
perhaps
there
fell
upon
the
unfamiliar
page
viewed
with
childish
tremor
half
apprehension
and
half
delight
a
mellow
sunshine
which
was
to
linger
for
ever
in
my
mind
but
i
am
thinking
of
the
were
this
the
sole
book
existing
in
greek
it
would
be
abundantly
worth
while
to
learn
the
language
in
order
to
read
it
the
is
an
admirable
work
of
art
unique
in
its
combination
of
concise
and
rapid
narrative
with
colour
and
picturesqueness
herodotus
wrote
a
prose
epic
in
which
the
personality
is
ever
before
us
xenophon
with
curiosity
and
love
of
adventure
which
mark
him
of
the
same
race
but
in
the
pursuit
of
a
new
artistic
virtue
created
the
historical
romance
what
a
world
of
wonders
in
this
little
book
all
aglow
with
ambitions
and
conflicts
with
marvels
of
strange
lands
full
of
perils
and
rescues
fresh
with
the
air
of
mountain
and
of
sea
think
of
it
for
a
moment
by
the
side
of
caesar
commentaries
not
to
compare
things
incomparable
but
in
order
to
appreciate
the
perfect
art
which
shines
through
xenophon
mastery
of
language
his
brevity
achieving
a
result
so
different
from
that
of
the
like
characteristic
in
the
roman
writer
caesar
conciseness
comes
of
strength
and
pride
xenophon
of
a
vivid
imagination
many
a
single
line
of
the
presents
a
picture
which
deeply
stirs
the
emotions
a
good
instance
occurs
in
the
fourth
book
where
a
delightful
passage
of
unsurpassable
narrative
tells
how
the
greeks
rewarded
and
dismissed
a
guide
who
had
led
them
through
dangerous
country
the
man
himself
was
in
peril
of
his
life
laden
with
valuable
things
which
the
soldiers
had
given
him
in
their
gratitude
he
turned
to
make
his
way
through
the
hostile
region
greek
text
when
evening
came
he
took
leave
of
us
and
went
his
way
by
night
to
my
mind
words
of
wonderful
suggestiveness
you
see
the
wild
eastern
landscape
upon
which
the
sun
has
set
there
are
the
hellenes
safe
for
the
moment
on
their
long
march
and
there
the
mountain
tribesman
the
serviceable
barbarian
going
away
alone
with
his
tempting
guerdon
into
the
hazards
of
the
darkness
also
in
the
fourth
book
another
picture
moves
one
in
another
way
among
the
carduchian
hills
two
men
were
seized
and
information
was
sought
from
them
about
the
track
to
be
followed
one
of
them
would
say
nothing
and
kept
silence
in
spite
of
every
threat
so
in
the
presence
of
his
companion
he
was
slain
thereupon
that
other
made
known
the
reason
for
refusing
to
point
out
the
way
in
the
direction
the
greeks
must
take
there
dwelt
a
daughter
of
his
who
was
married
it
would
not
be
easy
to
express
more
pathos
than
is
conveyed
in
these
few
words
xenophon
himself
one
may
be
sure
did
not
feel
it
quite
as
we
do
but
he
preserved
the
incident
for
its
own
sake
and
there
in
a
line
or
two
shines
something
of
human
love
and
sacrifice
significant
for
all
time
i
sometimes
think
i
will
go
and
spend
the
sunny
half
of
a
twelvemonth
in
wandering
about
the
british
isles
there
is
so
much
of
beauty
and
interest
that
i
have
not
seen
and
i
grudge
to
close
my
eyes
on
this
beloved
home
of
ours
leaving
any
corner
of
it
unvisited
often
i
wander
in
fancy
over
all
the
parts
i
know
and
grow
restless
with
desire
at
familiar
names
which
bring
no
picture
to
memory
my
array
of
county
they
have
always
been
irresistible
to
me
on
the
stalls
sets
me
roaming
the
only
dull
pages
in
them
are
those
that
treat
of
manufacturing
towns
yet
i
shall
never
start
on
that
pilgrimage
i
am
too
old
too
fixed
in
habits
i
dislike
the
railway
i
dislike
hotels
i
should
grow
homesick
for
my
library
my
garden
the
view
from
my
windows
and
then
i
have
such
a
fear
of
dying
anywhere
but
under
my
own
roof
as
a
rule
it
is
better
to
revisit
only
in
imagination
the
places
which
have
greatly
charmed
us
or
which
in
the
retrospect
seem
to
have
done
so
seem
to
have
charmed
us
i
say
for
the
memory
we
form
after
a
certain
lapse
of
time
of
places
where
we
lingered
often
bears
but
a
faint
resemblance
to
the
impression
received
at
the
time
what
in
truth
may
have
been
very
moderate
enjoyment
or
enjoyment
greatly
disturbed
by
inner
or
outer
circumstances
shows
in
the
distance
as
a
keen
delight
or
as
deep
still
happiness
on
the
other
hand
if
memory
creates
no
illusion
and
the
name
of
a
certain
place
is
associated
with
one
of
the
golden
moments
of
life
it
were
rash
to
hope
that
another
visit
would
repeat
the
experience
of
a
bygone
day
for
it
was
not
merely
the
sights
that
one
beheld
which
were
the
cause
of
joy
and
peace
however
lovely
the
spot
however
gracious
the
sky
these
things
external
would
not
have
availed
but
for
contributory
movements
of
mind
and
heart
and
blood
the
essentials
of
the
man
as
then
he
was
whilst
i
was
reading
this
afternoon
my
thoughts
strayed
and
i
found
myself
recalling
a
hillside
in
suffolk
where
after
a
long
walk
i
rested
drowsily
one
midsummer
day
twenty
years
ago
a
great
longing
seized
me
i
was
tempted
to
set
off
at
once
and
find
again
that
spot
under
the
high
elm
trees
where
as
i
smoked
a
delicious
pipe
i
heard
about
me
the
crack
crack
crack
of
bursting
in
the
glorious
heat
of
the
noontide
sun
had
i
acted
upon
the
impulse
what
chance
was
there
of
my
enjoying
such
another
hour
as
that
which
my
memory
cherished
no
no
it
is
not
the
that
i
remember
it
is
the
time
of
life
the
circumstances
the
mood
which
at
that
moment
fell
so
happily
together
can
i
dream
that
a
pipe
smoked
on
that
same
hillside
under
the
same
glowing
sky
would
taste
as
it
then
did
or
bring
me
the
same
solace
would
the
turf
be
so
soft
beneath
me
would
the
great
temper
so
delightfully
the
noontide
rays
beating
upon
them
and
when
the
hour
of
rest
was
over
should
i
spring
to
my
feet
as
then
i
did
eager
to
put
forth
my
strength
again
no
no
what
i
remember
is
just
one
moment
of
my
earlier
life
linked
by
accident
with
that
picture
of
the
suffolk
landscape
the
place
no
longer
exists
it
never
existed
save
for
me
for
it
is
the
mind
which
creates
the
world
about
us
and
even
though
we
stand
side
by
side
in
the
same
meadow
my
eyes
will
never
see
what
is
beheld
by
yours
my
heart
will
never
stir
to
the
emotions
with
which
yours
is
touched
xi
i
awoke
a
little
after
four
there
was
sunlight
upon
the
blind
that
pure
gold
of
the
earliest
beam
which
always
makes
me
think
of
dante
angels
i
had
slept
unusually
well
without
a
dream
and
felt
the
blessing
of
rest
through
all
my
frame
my
head
was
clear
my
pulse
beat
temperately
and
when
i
had
lain
thus
for
a
few
minutes
asking
myself
what
book
i
should
reach
from
the
shelf
that
hangs
near
my
pillow
there
came
upon
me
a
desire
to
rise
and
go
forth
into
the
early
morning
on
the
moment
i
bestirred
myself
the
drawing
up
of
the
blind
the
opening
of
the
window
only
increased
my
zeal
and
i
was
soon
in
the
garden
then
out
in
the
road
walking
i
cared
not
whither
how
long
is
it
since
i
went
forth
at
the
hour
of
summer
sunrise
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
physical
and
mental
that
any
man
in
moderate
health
can
grant
himself
yet
hardly
once
in
a
year
do
mood
and
circumstance
combine
to
put
it
within
one
reach
the
habit
of
lying
in
bed
hours
after
broad
daylight
is
strange
enough
if
one
thinks
of
it
a
habit
entirely
evil
one
of
the
most
foolish
changes
made
by
modern
system
in
the
healthier
life
of
the
old
time
but
that
my
energies
are
not
equal
to
such
great
innovation
i
would
begin
going
to
bed
at
sunset
and
rising
with
the
beam
of
day
ten
to
one
it
would
vastly
improve
my
health
and
undoubtedly
it
would
add
to
the
pleasures
of
my
existence
when
travelling
i
have
now
and
then
watched
the
sunrise
and
always
with
an
exultation
unlike
anything
produced
in
me
by
other
aspects
of
nature
i
remember
daybreak
on
the
mediterranean
the
shapes
of
islands
growing
in
hue
after
hue
of
tenderest
light
until
they
floated
amid
a
sea
of
glory
and
among
the
mountains
that
crowning
height
one
moment
a
cold
pallor
the
next
under
the
touch
of
the
goddess
these
are
the
things
i
shall
never
see
again
things
indeed
so
perfect
in
memory
that
i
should
dread
to
blur
them
by
a
newer
experience
my
senses
are
so
much
duller
they
do
not
show
me
what
once
they
did
how
far
away
is
that
time
when
i
found
a
pleasure
in
getting
up
and
escaping
from
the
dormitory
whilst
all
the
others
were
still
asleep
my
purpose
was
innocent
enough
i
got
up
early
only
to
do
my
lessons
i
can
see
the
long
lighted
by
the
early
sun
i
can
smell
the
odour
a
blend
of
books
and
slates
and
and
i
know
not
what
it
was
a
mental
peculiarity
of
mine
that
at
five
in
the
morning
i
could
apply
myself
with
gusto
to
mathematics
a
subject
loathsome
to
me
at
any
other
time
of
the
day
opening
the
book
at
some
section
which
was
wont
to
scare
me
i
used
to
say
to
myself
come
now
i
going
to
tackle
this
this
morning
if
other
boys
can
understand
it
why
should
i
and
in
a
measure
i
succeeded
in
a
measure
only
there
was
always
a
limit
at
which
my
powers
failed
me
strive
as
i
would
in
my
it
was
seldom
that
i
rose
early
with
the
exception
of
one
year
or
the
greater
part
of
a
twelvemonth
during
which
i
was
regularly
up
at
five
for
a
special
reason
i
had
undertaken
to
coach
a
man
for
the
london
matriculation
he
was
in
business
and
the
only
time
he
could
conveniently
give
to
his
studies
was
before
breakfast
i
just
then
had
my
lodgings
near
hampstead
road
my
pupil
lived
at
knightsbridge
i
engaged
to
be
with
him
every
morning
at
six
and
the
walk
at
a
brisk
pace
took
me
just
about
an
hour
at
that
time
i
saw
no
severity
in
the
arrangement
and
i
was
delighted
to
earn
the
modest
fee
which
enabled
me
to
write
all
day
long
without
fear
of
hunger
but
one
inconvenience
attached
to
it
i
had
no
watch
and
my
only
means
of
knowing
the
time
was
to
hear
the
striking
of
a
clock
in
the
neighbourhood
as
a
rule
i
awoke
just
when
i
should
have
done
the
clock
struck
five
and
up
i
sprang
but
occasionally
and
this
when
the
mornings
had
grown
dark
my
punctual
habit
failed
me
i
would
hear
the
clock
chime
some
fraction
of
the
hour
and
could
not
know
whether
i
had
awoke
too
soon
or
slept
too
long
the
horror
of
unpunctuality
which
has
always
been
a
craze
with
me
made
it
impossible
to
lie
waiting
more
than
once
i
dressed
and
went
out
into
the
street
to
discover
as
best
i
could
what
time
it
was
and
one
such
expedition
i
well
remember
took
place
between
two
and
three
on
a
morning
of
foggy
rain
it
happened
now
and
then
that
on
reaching
the
house
at
knightsbridge
i
was
informed
that
felt
too
tired
to
rise
this
concerned
me
little
for
it
meant
no
deduction
of
fee
i
had
the
two
hours
walk
and
was
all
the
better
for
it
then
the
appetite
with
which
i
sat
down
to
breakfast
whether
i
had
done
my
coaching
or
not
bread
and
butter
and
coffee
such
coffee
made
the
meal
and
i
ate
like
a
navvy
i
was
in
magnificent
spirits
all
the
way
home
i
had
been
thinking
of
my
work
and
the
morning
brain
clarified
and
whipped
to
vigour
by
that
brisk
exercise
by
that
wholesome
hunger
wrought
its
best
the
last
mouthful
swallowed
i
was
seated
at
my
aye
and
there
i
sat
for
seven
or
eight
hours
with
a
short
munching
interval
working
as
only
few
men
worked
in
all
london
with
pleasure
zeal
hope
yes
yes
those
were
the
good
days
they
did
not
last
long
before
and
after
them
were
cares
miseries
endurance
multiform
i
have
always
felt
grateful
to
of
knightsbridge
he
gave
me
a
year
of
health
and
almost
of
peace
xii
a
whole
day
walk
yesterday
with
no
plan
just
a
long
ramble
of
hour
after
hour
entirely
enjoyable
it
ended
at
topsham
where
i
sat
on
the
little
churchyard
terrace
and
watched
the
evening
tide
come
up
the
broad
estuary
i
have
a
great
liking
for
topsham
and
that
churchyard
overlooking
what
is
not
quite
sea
yet
more
than
river
is
one
of
the
most
restful
spots
i
know
of
course
the
association
with
old
chaucer
who
speaks
of
topsham
sailors
helps
my
mood
i
came
home
very
tired
but
i
am
not
yet
decrepit
and
for
that
i
must
be
thankful
the
unspeakable
blessedness
of
having
a
much
as
my
imagination
has
dwelt
upon
it
for
thirty
years
i
never
knew
how
deep
and
exquisite
a
joy
could
lie
in
the
assurance
that
one
is
for
ever
again
and
again
i
come
back
upon
this
thought
nothing
but
death
can
oust
me
from
my
abiding
place
and
death
i
would
fain
learn
to
regard
as
a
friend
who
will
but
intensify
the
peace
i
now
relish
when
one
is
at
home
how
one
affections
grow
about
everything
in
the
neighbourhood
i
always
thought
with
fondness
of
this
corner
of
devon
but
what
was
that
compared
with
the
love
which
now
strengthens
in
me
day
by
day
beginning
with
my
house
every
stick
and
stone
of
it
is
dear
to
me
as
my
heart
blood
i
find
myself
laying
an
affectionate
hand
on
the
giving
a
pat
as
i
go
by
to
the
garden
gate
every
tree
and
shrub
in
the
garden
is
my
beloved
friend
i
touch
them
when
need
is
very
tenderly
as
though
carelessness
might
pain
or
roughness
injure
them
if
i
pull
up
a
weed
in
the
walk
i
look
at
it
with
a
certain
sadness
before
throwing
it
away
it
belongs
to
my
home
and
all
the
country
round
about
these
villages
how
delightful
are
their
names
to
my
ear
i
find
myself
reading
with
interest
all
the
local
news
in
the
exeter
paper
not
that
i
care
about
the
people
with
barely
one
or
two
exceptions
the
people
are
nothing
to
me
and
the
less
i
see
of
them
the
better
i
am
pleased
but
the
grow
ever
more
dear
to
me
i
like
to
know
of
anything
that
has
happened
at
heavitree
or
brampford
speke
or
newton
cyres
i
begin
to
pride
myself
on
knowing
every
road
and
lane
every
bridle
path
and
for
miles
about
i
like
to
learn
the
names
of
farms
and
of
fields
and
all
this
because
here
is
my
abiding
place
because
i
am
home
for
ever
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
clouds
that
pass
above
my
house
are
more
interesting
and
beautiful
than
clouds
elsewhere
and
to
think
that
at
one
time
i
called
myself
a
socialist
communist
anything
you
like
of
the
revolutionary
kind
not
for
long
to
be
sure
and
i
suspect
that
there
was
always
something
in
me
that
scoffed
when
my
lips
uttered
such
things
why
no
man
living
has
a
more
profound
sense
of
property
than
i
no
man
ever
lived
who
was
in
every
fibre
more
vehemently
an
individualist
xiii
in
this
high
summertide
i
remember
with
a
strange
feeling
that
there
are
people
who
of
their
free
choice
spend
day
and
night
in
cities
who
throng
to
the
gabble
of
make
festival
in
public
houses
sweat
in
the
glare
of
the
theatre
they
call
it
life
they
call
it
enjoyment
why
so
it
is
for
them
they
are
so
made
the
folly
is
mine
to
wonder
that
they
fulfil
their
destiny
but
with
what
deep
and
quiet
thanksgiving
do
i
remind
myself
that
never
shall
i
mingle
with
that
and
tailored
herd
happily
i
never
saw
much
of
them
certain
occasions
i
recall
when
a
supposed
necessity
took
me
into
their
dismal
precincts
a
sick
buzzing
in
the
brain
a
languor
as
of
exhausted
limbs
comes
upon
me
with
the
memory
the
relief
with
which
i
stepped
out
into
the
street
again
when
all
was
over
dear
to
me
then
was
poverty
which
for
the
moment
seemed
to
make
me
a
free
man
dear
to
me
was
the
labour
at
my
desk
which
by
comparison
enabled
me
to
respect
myself
never
again
shall
i
shake
hands
with
man
or
woman
who
is
not
in
truth
my
friend
never
again
shall
i
go
to
see
acquaintances
with
whom
i
have
no
acquaintance
all
men
my
brothers
nay
thank
heaven
that
they
are
not
i
will
do
harm
if
i
can
help
it
to
no
one
i
will
wish
good
to
all
but
i
will
make
no
pretence
of
personal
kindliness
where
in
the
nature
of
things
it
can
not
be
felt
i
have
grimaced
a
smile
and
pattered
unmeaning
words
to
many
a
person
whom
i
despised
or
from
whom
in
heart
i
shrank
i
did
so
because
i
had
not
courage
to
do
otherwise
for
a
man
conscious
of
such
weakness
the
best
is
to
live
apart
from
the
world
brave
samuel
johnson
one
such
is
worth
all
the
moralists
and
preachers
who
ever
laboured
to
humanise
mankind
had
withdrawn
into
solitude
it
would
have
been
a
national
loss
every
one
of
his
blunt
fearless
words
had
more
value
than
a
whole
evangel
on
the
lips
of
a
timidly
good
man
it
is
thus
that
the
commonalty
however
well
clad
should
be
treated
so
seldom
does
the
fool
or
the
ruffian
in
broadcloth
hear
his
just
designation
so
seldom
is
the
man
found
who
has
a
right
to
address
him
by
it
by
the
bandying
of
insults
we
profit
nothing
there
can
be
no
useful
rebuke
which
is
exposed
to
a
but
as
the
world
is
an
honest
and
wise
man
should
have
a
rough
tongue
let
him
speak
and
spare
not
xiv
vituperation
of
the
english
climate
is
foolish
a
better
climate
does
not
exist
for
healthy
people
and
it
is
always
as
regards
the
average
native
in
sound
health
that
a
climate
must
be
judged
invalids
have
no
right
whatever
to
talk
petulantly
of
the
natural
changes
of
the
sky
nature
has
not
in
view
let
them
if
they
can
seek
exceptional
conditions
for
their
exceptional
state
leaving
behind
them
many
a
million
of
sound
hearty
men
and
women
who
take
the
seasons
as
they
come
and
profit
by
each
in
turn
in
its
freedom
from
extremes
in
its
common
clemency
even
in
its
caprice
which
at
the
worst
time
holds
out
hope
our
island
weather
compares
well
with
that
of
other
lands
who
enjoys
the
fine
day
of
spring
summer
autumn
or
winter
so
much
as
an
englishman
his
perpetual
talk
of
the
weather
is
testimony
to
his
keen
relish
for
most
of
what
it
offers
him
in
lands
of
blue
monotony
even
as
where
climatic
conditions
are
plainly
evil
such
talk
does
not
go
on
so
granting
that
we
have
bad
days
not
a
few
that
the
east
wind
takes
us
by
the
throat
that
the
mists
get
at
our
joints
that
the
sun
hides
his
glory
too
often
and
too
long
it
is
plain
that
the
result
of
all
comes
to
good
that
it
engenders
a
mood
of
zest
under
the
most
various
aspects
of
heaven
keeps
an
edge
on
our
appetite
for
life
i
of
course
am
one
of
the
weaklings
who
in
grumbling
at
the
weather
merely
invite
compassion
july
this
year
is
clouded
and
windy
very
cheerless
even
here
in
devon
i
fret
and
shiver
and
mutter
to
myself
something
about
southern
skies
pshaw
were
i
the
average
man
of
my
years
i
should
be
striding
over
haldon
caring
not
a
jot
for
the
heavy
sky
finding
a
score
of
compensations
for
the
lack
of
sun
can
i
not
have
patience
do
i
not
know
that
some
morning
the
east
will
open
like
a
bursting
bud
into
warmth
and
splendour
and
the
azure
depths
above
will
have
only
the
more
solace
for
my
starved
anatomy
because
of
this
protracted
disappointment
xv
i
have
been
at
the
seaside
enjoying
it
yes
but
in
what
a
doddering
senile
sort
of
way
is
it
i
who
used
to
drink
the
strong
wind
like
wine
who
ran
exultingly
along
the
wet
sands
and
leapt
from
rock
to
rock
barefoot
on
the
slippery
seaweed
who
breasted
the
swelling
breaker
and
shouted
with
joy
as
it
buried
me
in
gleaming
foam
at
the
seaside
i
knew
no
such
thing
as
bad
weather
there
were
but
changes
of
eager
mood
and
life
now
if
the
breeze
blow
too
roughly
if
there
come
a
pelting
shower
i
must
look
for
shelter
and
sit
with
my
cloak
about
me
it
is
but
a
new
reminder
that
i
do
best
to
stay
at
home
travelling
only
in
reminiscence
at
weymouth
i
enjoyed
a
hearty
laugh
one
of
the
good
things
not
easy
to
get
after
middle
age
there
was
a
notice
of
steamboats
which
ply
along
the
coast
steamboats
recommended
to
the
public
as
being
with
lavatories
and
a
ladies
think
how
many
people
read
this
without
a
chuckle
xvi
in
the
last
ten
years
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
english
inns
in
many
parts
of
the
country
and
it
astonishes
me
to
find
how
bad
they
are
only
once
or
twice
have
i
chanced
upon
an
inn
or
if
you
like
hotel
where
i
enjoyed
any
sort
of
comfort
more
often
than
not
even
the
beds
are
unsatisfactory
either
pretentiously
huge
and
choked
with
drapery
or
hard
and
thinly
accoutred
furnishing
is
uniformly
hideous
and
there
is
either
no
attempt
at
ornament
the
safest
thing
or
a
villainous
taste
thrusts
itself
upon
one
at
every
turn
the
meals
in
general
are
coarse
and
poor
in
quality
and
served
with
gross
slovenliness
i
have
often
heard
it
said
that
the
touring
cyclist
has
caused
the
revival
of
wayside
inns
it
may
be
so
but
the
touring
cyclist
seems
to
be
very
easily
satisfied
unless
we
are
greatly
deceived
by
the
old
writers
an
english
inn
used
to
be
a
delightful
resort
abounding
in
comfort
and
supplied
with
the
best
of
food
a
place
too
where
one
was
sure
of
welcome
at
once
hearty
and
courteous
the
inns
of
in
country
towns
and
villages
are
not
in
that
good
old
sense
inns
at
all
they
are
merely
the
landlord
chief
interest
is
the
sale
of
liquor
under
his
roof
you
may
if
you
choose
eat
and
sleep
but
what
you
are
expected
to
do
is
to
drink
yet
even
for
drinking
there
is
no
decent
accommodation
you
will
find
what
is
called
a
a
stuffy
and
dirty
room
with
crazy
chairs
where
only
the
sodden
gulper
could
imagine
himself
at
ease
should
you
wish
to
write
a
letter
only
the
worst
pen
and
the
vilest
ink
is
forthcoming
this
even
in
the
commercial
room
of
many
an
inn
which
seems
to
depend
upon
the
custom
of
travelling
tradesmen
indeed
this
whole
business
of
innkeeping
is
incredibly
mismanaged
most
of
all
does
the
common
ineptitude
or
brutality
enrage
one
when
it
has
possession
of
an
old
and
picturesque
house
such
as
reminds
you
of
the
best
tradition
a
house
which
might
be
made
as
comfortable
as
house
can
be
a
place
of
rest
and
mirth
at
a
you
expect
manners
and
nothing
better
will
meet
you
at
most
of
the
inns
or
hotels
it
surprises
me
to
think
in
how
few
instances
i
have
found
even
the
pretence
of
civility
as
a
rule
the
landlord
and
landlady
are
either
contemptuously
superior
or
boorishly
familiar
the
waiters
and
chambermaids
do
their
work
with
an
indifference
which
only
softens
to
a
condescending
interest
at
the
moment
of
your
departure
when
if
the
tip
be
thought
insufficient
a
sneer
or
a
muttered
insult
speeds
you
on
your
way
one
inn
i
remember
where
having
to
go
in
and
out
two
or
three
times
in
a
morning
i
always
found
the
front
door
blocked
by
the
portly
forms
of
two
women
the
landlady
and
the
barmaid
who
stood
there
chatting
and
surveying
the
street
coming
from
within
the
house
i
had
to
call
out
a
request
for
passage
it
was
granted
with
all
deliberation
and
with
not
a
syllable
of
apology
this
was
the
best
hotel
in
a
sussex
market
town
and
the
food
here
beyond
doubt
there
is
grave
degeneracy
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
the
old
travellers
by
coach
were
contented
with
entertainment
such
as
one
gets
nowadays
at
the
table
of
a
country
hotel
the
cooking
is
wont
to
be
wretched
the
quality
of
the
meat
and
vegetables
worse
than
mediocre
what
shall
one
ask
in
vain
at
an
english
inn
for
an
honest
chop
or
steak
again
and
again
has
my
appetite
been
frustrated
with
an
offer
of
mere
sinew
and
scrag
at
a
hotel
where
the
charge
for
lunch
was
five
shillings
i
have
been
sickened
with
pulpy
potatoes
and
stringy
cabbage
the
very
joint
ribs
or
sirloin
leg
or
shoulder
is
commonly
a
poor
underfed
sapless
thing
scorched
in
an
oven
and
as
for
the
round
of
beef
it
has
as
good
as
disappeared
probably
because
it
asks
too
much
skill
in
the
salting
then
again
one
breakfast
bacon
what
intolerable
stuff
smelling
of
saltpetre
has
been
set
before
me
when
i
paid
the
price
of
the
best
smoked
wiltshire
it
would
be
mere
indulgence
of
the
spirit
of
grumbling
to
talk
about
poisonous
tea
and
washy
coffee
every
one
knows
that
these
drinks
can
not
be
had
at
public
tables
but
what
if
there
be
real
reason
for
discontent
with
one
pint
of
ale
often
still
that
draught
from
the
local
brewery
is
sound
and
invigorating
but
there
are
grievous
exceptions
and
no
doubt
the
tendency
is
here
as
in
other
things
a
falling
off
a
carelessness
if
not
a
calculating
dishonesty
i
foresee
the
day
when
englishmen
will
have
forgotten
how
to
brew
beer
when
only
safety
will
lie
in
the
draught
imported
from
munich
xvii
i
was
taking
a
meal
once
at
a
london
restaurant
not
one
of
the
great
to
which
men
most
resort
but
a
small
establishment
on
the
same
model
in
a
quiet
neighbourhood
when
there
entered
and
sat
down
at
the
next
table
a
young
man
of
the
working
class
whose
dress
betokened
holiday
a
glance
told
me
that
he
felt
anything
but
at
ease
his
mind
misgave
him
as
he
looked
about
the
long
room
and
at
the
table
before
him
and
when
a
waiter
came
to
offer
him
the
card
he
stared
blankly
in
sheepish
confusion
some
strange
windfall
no
doubt
had
emboldened
him
to
enter
for
the
first
time
such
a
place
as
this
and
now
that
he
was
here
he
heartily
wished
himself
out
in
the
street
again
however
aided
by
the
waiter
suggestions
he
gave
an
order
for
a
and
vegetables
when
the
dish
was
served
the
poor
fellow
simply
could
not
make
a
start
upon
it
he
was
embarrassed
by
the
display
of
knives
and
forks
by
the
arrangement
of
the
dishes
by
the
sauce
bottles
and
the
above
all
no
doubt
by
the
assembly
of
people
not
of
his
class
and
the
unwonted
experience
of
being
waited
upon
by
a
man
with
a
long
he
grew
red
he
made
the
clumsiest
and
most
futile
efforts
to
transport
the
meat
to
his
plate
food
was
there
before
him
but
like
a
very
tantalus
he
was
forbidden
to
enjoy
it
observing
with
all
discretion
i
at
length
saw
him
pull
out
his
pocket
handkerchief
spread
it
on
the
table
and
with
a
sudden
effort
fork
the
meat
off
the
dish
into
this
receptacle
the
waiter
aware
by
this
time
of
the
customer
difficulty
came
up
and
spoke
a
word
to
him
abashed
into
anger
the
young
man
roughly
asked
what
he
had
to
pay
it
ended
in
the
waiter
bringing
a
newspaper
wherein
he
helped
to
wrap
up
meat
and
vegetables
money
was
flung
down
and
the
victim
of
a
mistaken
ambition
hurriedly
departed
to
satisfy
his
hunger
amid
less
unfamiliar
surroundings
it
was
a
striking
and
unpleasant
illustration
of
social
differences
could
such
a
thing
happen
in
any
country
but
england
i
doubt
it
the
sufferer
was
of
decent
appearance
and
with
ordinary
might
have
taken
his
meal
in
the
restaurant
like
any
one
else
quite
unnoticed
but
he
belonged
to
a
class
which
among
all
classes
in
the
world
is
distinguished
by
native
clownishness
and
by
unpliability
to
novel
circumstance
the
english
lower
ranks
had
need
be
marked
by
certain
peculiar
virtues
to
atone
for
their
deficiencies
in
other
respects
xviii
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
common
judgment
of
foreigners
regarding
the
english
people
go
about
in
england
as
a
stranger
travel
by
rail
live
at
hotels
see
nothing
but
the
broadly
public
aspect
of
things
and
the
impression
left
upon
you
will
be
one
of
hard
egoism
of
gruffness
and
sullenness
in
a
word
of
everything
that
contrasts
most
strongly
with
the
ideal
of
social
and
civic
life
and
yet
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
nation
possesses
in
so
high
a
degree
the
social
and
civic
virtues
the
unsociable
englishman
quotha
why
what
country
in
the
world
can
show
such
multifarious
vigorous
and
cordial
in
all
ranks
but
especially
of
course
among
the
intelligent
for
ends
which
concern
the
common
good
unsociable
why
go
where
you
will
in
england
you
can
hardly
find
a
man
nowadays
indeed
scarce
an
educated
woman
who
does
not
belong
to
some
alliance
for
study
or
sport
for
municipal
or
national
benefit
and
who
will
not
be
seen
in
leisure
time
doing
his
best
as
a
social
being
take
the
sleepy
it
is
bubbling
with
all
manner
of
associated
activities
and
these
of
the
quite
voluntary
kind
forms
of
zealously
united
effort
such
as
are
never
dreamt
of
in
the
countries
supposed
to
be
eminently
social
sociability
does
not
consist
in
a
readiness
to
talk
at
large
with
the
first
comer
it
is
not
dependent
upon
natural
grace
and
suavity
it
is
compatible
indeed
with
thoroughly
awkward
and
all
but
brutal
manners
the
english
have
never
at
all
events
for
some
two
centuries
past
inclined
to
the
purely
ceremonial
or
mirthful
forms
of
sociability
but
as
regards
every
prime
interest
of
the
community
health
and
comfort
of
body
and
of
soul
their
social
instinct
is
supreme
yet
it
is
so
difficult
to
reconcile
this
indisputable
fact
with
that
other
fact
no
less
obvious
that
your
common
englishman
seems
to
have
no
geniality
from
the
one
point
of
view
i
admire
and
laud
my
fellow
countryman
from
the
other
i
heartily
dislike
him
and
wish
to
see
as
little
of
him
as
possible
one
is
wont
to
think
of
the
english
as
a
genial
folk
have
they
lost
in
this
respect
has
the
century
of
science
and
sensibly
affected
the
national
character
i
think
always
of
my
experience
at
the
english
inn
where
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
a
brutal
indifference
to
the
humane
features
of
life
where
food
is
bolted
without
attention
liquor
swallowed
out
of
mere
habit
where
even
accost
is
a
thing
so
rare
as
to
be
remarkable
two
things
have
to
be
borne
in
mind
the
extraordinary
difference
of
demeanour
which
exists
between
the
refined
and
the
vulgar
english
and
the
natural
difficulty
of
an
englishman
in
revealing
his
true
self
save
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
so
striking
is
the
difference
of
manner
between
class
and
class
that
the
hasty
observer
might
well
imagine
a
corresponding
and
radical
difference
of
mind
and
character
in
russia
i
suppose
the
social
extremities
are
seen
to
be
pretty
far
apart
but
with
that
possible
exception
i
should
think
no
european
country
can
show
such
a
gap
as
yawns
to
the
eye
between
the
english
gentleman
and
the
english
boor
the
boor
of
course
is
the
multitude
the
boor
impresses
himself
upon
the
traveller
when
relieved
from
his
presence
one
can
be
just
to
him
one
can
remember
that
his
virtues
though
elementary
and
strictly
in
need
of
direction
are
the
same
to
a
great
extent
as
those
of
the
man
he
does
not
represent
though
seeming
to
do
so
a
nation
apart
to
understand
this
multitude
you
must
get
below
its
insufferable
manners
and
learn
that
very
fine
civic
qualities
can
consist
with
a
personal
bearing
almost
wholly
repellent
then
as
to
the
dogged
reserve
of
the
educated
man
why
i
have
only
to
look
into
myself
i
it
is
true
am
not
quite
a
representative
englishman
my
my
meditative
habit
of
mind
rather
dim
my
national
and
social
characteristics
but
set
me
among
a
few
specimens
of
the
multitude
and
am
i
not
at
once
aware
of
that
instinctive
antipathy
that
shrinking
into
myself
that
something
like
unto
scorn
of
which
the
englishman
is
accused
by
foreigners
who
casually
meet
him
peculiar
to
me
is
the
effort
to
overcome
this
first
impulse
an
effort
which
often
enough
succeeds
if
i
know
myself
at
all
i
am
not
an
ungenial
man
and
yet
i
am
quite
sure
that
many
people
who
have
known
me
casually
would
say
that
my
fault
is
a
lack
of
geniality
to
show
my
true
self
i
must
be
in
the
right
mood
and
the
right
circumstances
which
after
all
is
merely
as
much
as
saying
that
i
am
decidedly
english
xix
on
my
breakfast
table
there
is
a
pot
of
honey
not
the
manufactured
stuff
sold
under
that
name
in
shops
but
honey
of
the
hive
brought
to
me
by
a
neighbouring
cottager
whose
bees
often
hum
in
my
garden
it
gives
i
confess
more
pleasure
to
my
eye
than
to
my
palate
but
i
like
to
taste
of
it
because
it
is
honey
there
is
as
much
difference
said
johnson
between
a
lettered
and
an
unlettered
man
as
between
the
living
and
the
dead
and
in
a
way
it
was
no
extravagance
think
merely
how
one
view
of
common
things
is
affected
by
literary
association
what
were
honey
to
me
if
i
knew
nothing
of
hymettus
and
hybla
if
my
mind
had
no
stores
of
poetry
no
memories
of
romance
suppose
me
the
name
might
bring
with
it
some
pleasantness
of
rustic
odour
but
of
what
poor
significance
even
that
if
the
country
were
to
me
mere
grass
and
corn
and
vegetables
as
to
the
man
who
has
never
read
nor
wished
to
read
for
the
poet
is
indeed
a
maker
above
the
world
of
sense
trodden
by
hidebound
humanity
he
builds
that
world
of
his
own
whereto
is
summoned
the
unfettered
spirit
why
does
it
delight
me
to
see
the
bat
flitting
at
dusk
before
my
window
or
to
hear
the
hoot
of
the
owl
when
all
the
ways
are
dark
i
might
regard
the
bat
with
disgust
and
the
owl
either
with
vague
superstition
or
not
heed
it
at
all
but
these
have
their
place
in
the
poet
world
and
carry
me
above
this
idle
present
i
once
passed
a
night
in
a
little
where
i
had
arrived
tired
and
went
to
bed
early
i
slept
forthwith
but
was
presently
awakened
by
i
knew
not
what
in
the
darkness
there
sounded
a
sort
of
music
and
as
my
brain
cleared
i
was
aware
of
the
soft
chiming
of
church
bells
why
what
hour
could
it
be
i
struck
a
light
and
looked
at
my
watch
midnight
then
a
glow
came
over
me
we
have
heard
the
chimes
at
midnight
master
shallow
never
till
then
had
heard
them
and
the
town
in
which
i
slept
was
evesham
but
a
few
miles
from
what
if
those
midnight
bells
had
been
to
me
but
as
any
other
and
i
had
reviled
them
for
breaking
my
sleep
johnson
did
not
much
exaggerate
xx
it
is
the
second
jubilee
bonfires
blaze
upon
the
hills
making
one
think
of
the
watchman
on
agamemnon
citadel
it
were
more
germane
to
the
matter
to
think
of
queen
elizabeth
and
the
armada
though
wishing
the
uproar
happily
over
i
can
see
the
good
in
it
as
well
as
another
man
english
monarchy
as
we
know
it
is
a
triumph
of
english
common
sense
grant
that
men
can
not
do
without
an
overlord
how
to
make
that
consist
with
the
largest
practical
measure
of
national
and
individual
liberty
we
at
all
events
have
for
a
time
solved
the
question
for
a
time
only
of
course
but
consider
the
history
of
europe
and
our
jubilation
is
perhaps
justified
for
sixty
years
has
the
british
republic
held
on
its
way
under
one
president
it
is
wide
of
the
mark
to
object
that
other
republics
which
change
their
president
more
frequently
support
the
semblance
of
lordship
at
considerably
less
cost
to
the
people
britons
are
minded
for
the
present
that
the
head
of
their
state
shall
be
called
king
or
queen
the
name
is
pleasant
to
them
it
corresponds
to
a
popular
sentiment
vaguely
understood
but
still
operative
which
is
called
loyalty
the
majority
thinking
thus
and
the
system
being
found
to
work
more
than
tolerably
well
what
purpose
could
be
served
by
an
attempt
at
the
nation
is
content
to
pay
the
price
it
is
the
nation
affair
moreover
who
can
feel
the
least
assurance
that
a
change
to
one
of
the
common
forms
of
republicanism
would
be
for
the
general
advantage
do
we
find
that
countries
which
have
made
the
experiment
are
so
very
much
better
off
than
our
own
in
point
of
stable
quiet
government
and
of
national
welfare
the
theorist
scoffs
at
forms
which
have
survived
their
meaning
at
privilege
which
will
bear
no
examination
at
compromises
which
sound
ludicrous
at
submissions
which
seem
contemptible
but
let
him
put
forward
his
practical
scheme
for
making
all
men
rational
consistent
just
englishmen
i
imagine
are
not
endowed
with
these
qualities
in
any
extraordinary
degree
their
strength
politically
speaking
lies
in
a
recognition
of
expediency
complemented
by
respect
for
the
established
fact
one
of
the
facts
particularly
clear
to
them
is
the
suitability
to
their
minds
their
tempers
their
habits
of
a
system
of
polity
which
has
been
established
by
the
slow
effort
of
generations
within
this
realm
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
ideals
they
never
trouble
themselves
to
think
about
the
rights
of
man
if
you
talk
to
them
long
enough
about
the
rights
of
the
shopman
or
the
ploughman
or
the
they
will
lend
ear
and
when
the
facts
of
any
such
case
have
been
examined
they
will
find
a
way
of
dealing
with
them
this
characteristic
of
theirs
they
call
common
sense
to
them
all
things
considered
it
has
been
of
vast
service
one
may
even
say
that
the
rest
of
the
world
has
profited
by
it
not
a
little
that
uncommon
sense
might
now
and
then
have
stood
them
even
in
better
stead
is
nothing
to
the
point
the
englishman
deals
with
things
as
they
are
and
first
and
foremost
accepts
his
own
being
this
jubilee
declares
a
legitimate
triumph
of
the
average
man
look
back
for
threescore
years
and
who
shall
affect
to
doubt
that
the
time
has
been
marked
by
many
improvements
in
the
material
life
of
the
english
people
often
have
they
been
at
loggerheads
among
themselves
but
they
have
never
flown
at
each
other
throats
and
from
every
grave
dispute
has
resulted
some
substantial
gain
they
are
a
cleaner
people
and
a
more
sober
in
every
class
there
is
a
diminution
of
brutality
education
stand
for
what
it
may
has
notably
extended
certain
forms
of
tyranny
have
been
abolished
certain
forms
of
suffering
due
to
heedlessness
or
ignorance
have
been
abated
true
these
are
mere
details
whether
they
indicate
a
solid
advance
in
civilization
can
not
yet
be
determined
but
assuredly
the
average
briton
has
cause
to
jubilate
for
the
progressive
features
of
the
epoch
are
such
as
he
can
understand
and
approve
whereas
the
doubt
which
may
be
cast
upon
its
ethical
complexion
is
for
him
either
or
unintelligible
so
let
cressets
flare
into
the
night
from
all
the
hills
it
is
no
purchased
exultation
no
servile
flattery
the
people
acclaims
itself
yet
not
without
genuine
gratitude
and
affection
towards
the
representative
of
its
glory
and
its
power
the
constitutional
compact
has
been
well
preserved
review
the
record
of
kingdoms
and
say
how
often
it
has
come
to
pass
that
sovereign
and
people
rejoiced
together
over
bloodless
victories
xxi
at
an
inn
in
the
north
i
once
heard
three
men
talking
at
their
breakfast
on
the
question
of
diet
they
agreed
that
most
people
ate
too
much
meat
and
one
of
them
went
so
far
as
to
declare
that
for
his
part
he
rather
preferred
vegetables
and
fruit
why
he
said
will
you
believe
me
that
i
sometimes
make
a
breakfast
of
apples
this
announcement
was
received
in
silence
evidently
the
two
listeners
did
quite
know
what
to
think
of
it
thereupon
the
speaker
in
rather
a
blustering
tone
cried
out
yes
i
can
make
a
very
good
breakfast
on
or
three
pounds
of
was
it
amusing
and
was
it
characteristic
this
honest
briton
had
gone
too
far
in
frankness
is
all
very
well
to
like
vegetables
and
fruits
up
to
a
certain
point
but
to
breakfast
on
apples
his
companions
silence
proved
that
they
were
just
a
little
ashamed
of
him
his
confession
savoured
of
poverty
or
meanness
to
right
himself
in
their
opinion
nothing
better
occurred
to
the
man
than
to
protest
that
he
ate
apples
yes
but
not
merely
one
or
two
he
ate
them
largely
the
i
laughed
at
the
fellow
but
i
thoroughly
understood
him
so
would
every
englishman
for
at
the
root
of
our
being
is
a
hatred
of
parsimony
this
manifests
itself
in
all
sorts
of
ludicrous
or
contemptible
forms
but
no
less
is
it
the
source
of
our
finest
qualities
an
englishman
desires
above
all
to
live
largely
on
that
account
he
not
only
dreads
but
hates
and
despises
poverty
his
virtues
are
those
of
the
and
opulent
man
his
weaknesses
come
of
the
sense
of
inferiority
intensely
painful
and
humiliating
which
attaches
in
his
mind
to
one
who
can
not
spend
and
give
his
vices
for
the
most
part
originate
in
loss
of
due
to
loss
of
secure
position
xxii
for
a
nation
of
this
temper
the
movement
towards
democracy
is
fraught
with
peculiar
dangers
profoundly
aristocratic
in
his
sympathies
the
englishman
has
always
seen
in
the
patrician
class
not
merely
a
social
but
a
moral
superiority
the
man
of
blue
blood
was
to
him
a
living
representative
of
those
potencies
and
virtues
which
made
his
ideal
of
the
worthy
life
very
significant
is
the
cordial
alliance
from
old
time
between
nobles
and
people
free
proud
homage
on
one
side
answering
to
gallant
championship
on
the
other
both
classes
working
together
in
the
cause
of
liberty
however
great
the
sacrifices
of
the
common
folk
for
the
maintenance
of
aristocratic
power
and
splendour
they
were
gladly
made
this
was
the
englishman
religion
his
inborn
in
the
depths
of
the
dullest
soul
moved
a
perception
of
the
ethic
meaning
attached
to
lordship
your
lord
was
the
privileged
being
endowed
by
descent
with
generous
instincts
and
possessed
of
means
to
show
them
forth
in
act
a
poor
noble
was
a
contradiction
in
terms
if
such
a
person
existed
he
could
only
be
spoken
of
with
wondering
sadness
as
though
he
were
the
victim
of
some
freak
of
nature
the
lord
was
honourable
right
honourable
his
acts
his
words
virtually
constituted
the
code
of
honour
whereby
the
nation
lived
in
a
new
world
beyond
the
ocean
there
grew
up
a
new
race
a
scion
of
england
which
shaped
its
life
without
regard
to
the
principle
of
hereditary
lordship
and
in
course
of
time
this
triumphant
republic
began
to
shake
the
ideals
of
the
motherland
its
civilization
spite
of
superficial
resemblances
is
not
english
let
him
who
will
think
it
superior
all
one
cares
to
say
is
that
it
has
already
shown
in
a
broad
picture
the
natural
tendencies
of
english
blood
when
emancipated
from
the
old
cult
easy
to
understand
that
some
there
are
who
see
nothing
but
evil
in
the
influence
of
that
vast
commonwealth
if
it
has
done
us
good
assuredly
the
fact
is
not
yet
demonstrable
in
old
england
democracy
is
a
thing
so
alien
to
our
traditions
and
rooted
sentiment
that
the
line
of
its
progress
seems
hitherto
a
mere
track
of
ruin
in
the
very
word
is
something
from
which
we
shrink
it
seems
to
signify
nothing
less
than
a
national
apostasy
a
denial
of
the
faith
in
which
we
won
our
glory
the
democratic
englishman
is
by
the
laws
of
his
own
nature
in
parlous
case
he
has
lost
the
ideal
by
which
he
guided
his
rude
prodigal
domineering
instincts
in
place
of
the
right
honourable
born
to
noble
things
he
has
set
up
the
mere
plebs
born
more
likely
than
not
for
all
manner
of
baseness
and
amid
all
his
show
of
loud
the
man
is
haunted
with
misgiving
the
task
before
us
is
no
light
one
can
we
whilst
losing
the
class
retain
the
idea
it
embodied
can
we
english
ever
so
subject
to
the
material
liberate
ourselves
from
that
old
association
yet
guard
its
meaning
in
the
sphere
of
spiritual
life
can
we
with
eyes
which
have
ceased
to
look
reverently
on
symbols
learn
to
select
from
among
the
multitude
and
place
in
reverence
even
higher
him
who
holds
his
patent
of
nobility
straight
from
almighty
god
upon
that
depends
the
future
of
england
in
days
gone
by
our
very
snob
bore
testimony
after
his
fashion
to
our
scorn
of
meanness
he
at
all
events
imagined
himself
to
be
imitating
those
who
were
incapable
of
a
sordid
transaction
of
a
plebeian
compliance
but
the
snob
one
notes
is
in
the
way
of
degeneracy
he
has
new
exemplars
he
speaks
a
ruder
language
him
be
sure
in
one
form
or
another
we
shall
have
always
with
us
and
to
observe
his
habits
is
to
note
the
tenor
of
the
time
if
he
have
at
the
back
of
his
dim
mind
no
living
ideal
which
lends
his
foolishness
a
generous
significance
then
indeed
xxiii
a
visit
from
he

with
me

days

he
could
have
stayed
a
third

bear
but
a
certain
amount
of
conversation
even
the
pleasantest
and
before
long
i
desire
solitude
which
is
rest
the
mere
sight
of
to
say
nothing
of
his
talk
did
me
good
if
appearances
can
ever
be
trusted
there
are
few
men
who
get
more
enjoyment
out
of
life
his
hardships
were
never
excessive
they
did
not
affect
his
health
or
touch
his
spirits
probably
he
is
in
every
way
a
better
man
for
having
as
he
says
gone
through
the
mill
his
recollection
of
the
time
when
he
had
to
work
hard
for
a
note
and
was
not
always
sure
of
getting
it
obviously
lends
gusto
to
his
present
state
of
ease
i
persuaded
him
to
talk
about
his
successes
and
to
give
me
a
glimpse
of
their
meaning
in
solid
cash
last
midsummer
day
his
receipts
for
the
twelvemonth
were
more
than
two
thousand
pounds
nothing
wonderful
of
course
bearing
in
mind
what
some
men
are
making
by
their
pen
but
very
good
for
a
writer
who
does
not
address
the
baser
throng
two
thousand
pounds
in
a
year
i
gazed
at
him
with
wonder
and
admiration
i
have
known
very
few
prosperous
men
of
letters
n
represents
for
me
the
best
and
brightest
side
of
literary
success
say
what
one
will
after
a
lifetime
of
disillusion
the
author
who
earns
largely
by
honest
and
capable
work
is
among
the
few
enviable
mortals
think
of
n
existence
no
other
man
could
do
what
he
is
doing
and
he
does
it
with
ease
two
or
at
most
three
hours
work
a
day
and
that
by
no
means
every
day
suffices
to
him
like
all
who
write
he
has
his
unfruitful
times
his
mental
worries
his
disappointments
but
these
bear
no
proportion
to
the
hours
of
happy
and
effective
labour
every
time
i
see
him
he
looks
in
better
health
for
of
late
years
he
has
taken
much
more
exercise
and
he
is
often
travelling
he
is
happy
in
his
wife
and
children
the
thought
of
all
the
comforts
and
pleasures
he
is
able
to
give
them
must
be
a
constant
joy
to
him
were
he
to
die
his
family
is
safe
from
want
he
has
friends
and
acquaintances
as
many
as
he
desires
congenial
folk
gather
at
his
table
he
is
welcome
in
pleasant
houses
near
and
far
his
praise
is
upon
the
lips
of
all
whose
praise
is
worth
having
with
all
this
he
has
the
good
sense
to
avoid
manifest
dangers
he
has
not
abandoned
his
privacy
and
he
seems
to
be
in
no
danger
of
being
spoilt
by
good
fortune
his
work
is
more
to
him
than
a
means
of
earning
money
he
talks
about
a
book
he
has
in
hand
almost
as
freshly
and
keenly
as
in
the
old
days
when
his
annual
income
was
barely
a
couple
of
hundred
i
note
too
that
his
leisure
is
not
swamped
with
the
publications
of
the
day
he
reads
as
many
old
books
as
new
and
keeps
many
of
his
early
enthusiasms
he
is
one
of
the
men
i
heartily
like
that
he
greatly
cares
for
me
i
do
not
suppose
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
enough
that
he
likes
my
society
well
enough
to
make
a
special
journey
down
into
devon
i
represent
to
him
of
course
the
days
gone
by
and
for
their
sake
he
will
always
feel
an
interest
in
me
being
ten
years
my
junior
he
must
naturally
regard
me
as
an
old
buffer
i
notice
indeed
that
he
is
just
a
little
too
deferential
at
moments
he
feels
a
certain
respect
for
some
of
my
work
but
thinks
i
am
sure
that
i
ceased
writing
none
too
soon
which
is
very
true
if
i
had
not
been
such
a
lucky
fellow
if
at
this
moment
i
were
still
toiling
for
bread
it
is
probable
that
he
and
i
would
see
each
other
very
seldom
for
n
has
delicacy
and
would
shrink
from
bringing
his
affluence
face
to
face
with
grub
street
squalor
and
gloom
whilst
i
on
the
other
hand
should
hate
to
think
that
he
kept
up
my
acquaintance
from
a
sense
of
decency
as
it
is
we
are
very
good
friends
quite
unembarrassed
and
for
a
couple
of
days
really
enjoy
the
sight
and
hearing
of
each
other
that
i
am
able
to
give
him
a
comfortable
bedroom
and
set
before
him
an
eatable
dinner
flatters
my
pride
if
i
chose
at
any
time
to
accept
his
hearty
invitation
i
can
do
so
without
moral
twinges
two
thousand
pounds
if
at
n
age
i
had
achieved
that
income
what
would
have
been
the
result
upon
me
nothing
but
good
i
know
but
what
form
would
the
good
have
taken
should
i
have
become
a
social
man
a
giver
of
dinners
a
member
of
clubs
or
should
i
merely
have
begun
ten
years
sooner
the
life
i
am
living
now
that
is
more
likely
in
my
twenties
i
used
to
say
to
myself
what
a
splendid
thing
it
will
be
i
am
the
possessor
of
a
thousand
pounds
well
i
have
never
possessed
that
sum
never
anything
like
it
and
now
never
shall
yet
it
was
not
an
extravagant
ambition
methinks
however
primitive
as
we
sat
in
the
garden
dusk
the
scent
of
our
pipes
mingling
with
that
of
roses
n
said
to
me
in
a
laughing
tone
come
now
tell
me
how
you
felt
when
you
first
heard
of
your
legacy
and
i
could
not
tell
him
i
had
nothing
to
say
no
vivid
recollection
of
the
moment
would
come
back
to
me
i
am
afraid
n
thought
he
had
been
indiscreet
for
he
passed
quickly
to
another
subject
thinking
it
over
now
i
see
of
course
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
put
into
words
the
feeling
of
that
supreme
moment
of
life
it
was
not
joy
that
possessed
me
i
did
not
exult
i
did
not
lose
control
of
myself
in
any
way
but
i
remember
drawing
one
or
two
deep
sighs
as
if
all
at
once
relieved
of
some
distressing
burden
or
constraint
only
some
hours
after
did
i
begin
to
feel
any
kind
of
agitation
that
night
i
did
not
close
my
eyes
the
night
after
i
slept
longer
and
more
soundly
than
i
remember
to
have
done
for
a
score
of
years
once
or
twice
in
the
first
week
i
had
a
hysterical
feeling
i
scarce
kept
myself
from
shedding
tears
and
the
strange
thing
is
that
it
seems
to
have
happened
so
long
ago
i
seem
to
have
been
a
free
man
for
many
a
twelvemonth
instead
of
only
for
two
indeed
that
is
what
i
have
often
thought
about
forms
of
true
happiness
the
brief
are
quite
as
satisfying
as
those
that
last
long
i
wanted
before
my
death
to
enjoy
liberty
from
care
and
repose
in
a
place
i
love
that
was
granted
me
and
had
i
known
it
only
for
one
whole
year
the
sum
of
my
enjoyment
would
have
been
no
whit
less
than
if
i
live
to
savour
it
for
a
decade
xxiv
the
honest
fellow
who
comes
to
dig
in
my
garden
is
puzzled
to
account
for
my
peculiarities
i
often
catch
a
look
of
wondering
speculation
in
his
eye
when
it
turns
upon
me
it
is
all
because
i
will
not
let
him
lay
out
in
the
usual
way
and
make
the
bit
of
ground
in
front
of
the
house
really
neat
and
ornamental
at
first
he
put
it
down
to
meanness
but
he
knows
by
now
that
that
can
not
be
the
explanation
that
i
really
prefer
a
garden
so
poor
and
plain
that
every
cottager
would
be
ashamed
of
it
he
can
not
bring
himself
to
believe
and
of
course
i
have
long
since
given
up
trying
to
explain
myself
the
good
man
probably
concludes
that
too
many
books
and
the
habit
of
solitude
have
somewhat
affected
what
he
would
call
my
reasons
the
only
garden
flowers
i
care
for
are
the
quite
roses
sunflowers
hollyhocks
lilies
and
so
on
and
these
i
like
to
see
growing
as
much
as
possible
as
if
they
were
wild
trim
and
symmetrical
beds
are
my
abhorrence
and
most
of
the
flowers
which
are
put
into
them
hybrids
with
some
grotesque
name
jonesia
snooksia
hurt
my
eyes
on
the
other
hand
a
garden
is
a
garden
and
i
would
not
try
to
introduce
into
it
the
flowers
which
are
my
solace
in
lanes
and
fields
foxgloves
for
instance
it
would
pain
me
to
see
them
thus
transplanted
i
think
of
foxgloves
for
it
is
the
moment
of
their
glory
yesterday
i
went
to
the
lane
which
i
visit
every
year
at
this
time
the
deep
rutty
descending
between
banks
covered
with
giant
fronds
of
the
polypodium
and
overhung
with
and
hazel
to
that
cool
grassy
nook
where
the
noble
flowers
hang
on
stems
all
but
of
my
own
height
nowhere
have
i
seen
finer
foxgloves
i
suppose
they
rejoice
me
so
because
of
early
memories
to
a
child
it
is
the
most
impressive
of
wild
flowers
i
would
walk
miles
any
day
to
see
a
fine
cluster
as
i
would
to
see
the
shining
of
purple
loosestrife
by
the
water
edge
or
white
lilies
floating
upon
the
still
depth
but
the
gardener
and
i
understand
each
other
as
soon
as
we
go
to
the
back
of
the
house
and
get
among
the
vegetables
on
that
ground
he
finds
me
perfectly
sane
and
indeed
i
am
not
sure
that
the
kitchen
garden
does
not
give
me
more
pleasure
than
the
domain
of
flowers
every
morning
i
step
round
before
breakfast
to
see
how
things
are
coming
on
it
is
happiness
to
note
the
swelling
of
pods
the
healthy
vigour
of
potato
plants
aye
even
the
shooting
up
of
radishes
and
cress
this
year
i
have
a
grove
of
jerusalem
artichokes
they
are
seven
or
eight
feet
high
and
i
seem
to
get
vigour
as
i
look
at
the
stems
which
are
all
but
trunks
at
the
great
beautiful
leaves
delightful
too
are
the
scarlet
runners
which
have
to
be
propped
again
and
again
or
they
would
break
down
under
the
abundance
of
their
yield
it
is
a
treat
to
me
to
go
among
them
with
a
basket
gathering
i
feel
as
though
nature
herself
showed
kindness
to
me
in
giving
me
such
abundant
food
how
fresh
and
wholesome
are
the
odours
especially
if
a
shower
has
fallen
not
long
ago
i
have
some
magnificent
carrots
this
year
straight
clean
tapering
the
colour
a
joy
to
look
upon
xxv
for
two
things
do
my
thoughts
turn
now
and
then
to
london
i
should
like
to
hear
the
long
note
of
a
master
violin
or
the
faultless
cadence
of
an
exquisite
voice
and
i
should
like
to
see
pictures
music
and
painting
have
always
meant
much
to
me
here
i
can
enjoy
them
only
in
memory
of
course
there
is
the
discomfort
of
and
my
pleasure
in
the
finest
music
would
be
greatly
spoilt
by
having
to
sit
amid
a
crowd
with
some
idiot
audible
on
right
hand
or
left
and
the
show
of
pictures
would
give
me
a
headache
in
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
sum
qualis
when
i
waited
several
hours
at
the
gallery
door
to
hear
patti
and
knew
not
a
moment
fatigue
to
the
end
of
the
concert
or
when
at
the
academy
i
was
astonished
to
find
that
it
was
four
and
i
had
forgotten
food
since
breakfast
the
truth
is
i
do
not
much
enjoy
anything
nowadays
which
i
can
not
enjoy
it
sounds
morose
i
imagine
the
comment
of
good
people
if
they
overheard
such
a
confession
ought
i
in
truth
to
be
ashamed
of
it
i
always
read
the
newspaper
articles
on
exhibitions
of
pictures
and
with
most
pleasure
when
the
pictures
are
landscapes
the
mere
names
of
paintings
often
gladden
me
for
a
whole
day
those
names
which
bring
before
the
mind
a
bit
of
seashore
a
riverside
a
glimpse
of
moorland
or
of
woods
however
feeble
his
criticism
the
journalist
generally
writes
with
appreciation
of
these
subjects
his
descriptions
carry
me
away
to
all
sorts
of
places
which
i
shall
never
see
again
with
the
bodily
eye
and
i
thank
him
for
his
unconscious
magic
much
better
this
after
all
than
really
going
to
london
and
seeing
the
pictures
themselves
they
would
not
disappoint
me
i
love
and
honour
even
the
least
of
english
landscape
painters
but
i
should
try
to
see
too
many
at
once
and
fall
back
into
my
old
mood
of
tired
grumbling
at
the
conditions
of
modern
life
for
a
year
or
two
i
have
grumbled
little
all
the
better
for
me
xxvi
of
late
i
have
been
wishing
for
music
an
odd
chance
gratified
my
desire
i
had
to
go
into
exeter
yesterday
i
got
there
about
sunset
transacted
my
business
and
turned
to
walk
home
again
through
the
warm
twilight
in
southernhay
as
i
was
passing
a
house
of
which
the
windows
stood
open
there
sounded
the
notes
of
a
piano
chords
touched
by
a
skilful
hand
i
checked
my
step
hoping
and
in
a
minute
or
two
the
musician
began
to
play
that
nocturne
of
chopin
which
i
love
best
i
know
how
to
name
it
my
heart
leapt
there
i
stood
in
the
thickening
dusk
the
glorious
sounds
floating
about
me
and
i
trembled
with
very
ecstasy
of
enjoyment
when
silence
came
i
waited
in
the
hope
of
another
piece
but
nothing
followed
and
so
i
went
my
way
it
is
well
for
me
that
i
can
not
hear
music
when
i
will
assuredly
i
should
not
have
such
intense
pleasure
as
comes
to
me
now
and
then
by
haphazard
as
i
walked
on
forgetting
all
about
the
distance
and
reaching
home
before
i
knew
i
was
half
way
there
i
felt
gratitude
to
my
unknown
benefactor
a
state
of
mind
i
have
often
experienced
in
the
days
long
gone
by
it
happened
at
times
not
in
my
barest
days
but
in
those
of
decent
poverty
that
some
one
in
the
house
where
i
lodged
played
the
piano
and
how
it
rejoiced
me
when
this
came
to
pass
i
say
played
the
piano
a
phrase
that
covers
much
for
my
own
part
i
was
very
tolerant
anything
that
could
by
the
largest
interpretation
be
called
music
i
welcomed
and
was
thankful
for
even
exercises
i
found
at
moments
better
than
nothing
for
it
was
when
i
was
labouring
at
my
desk
that
the
notes
of
the
instrument
were
grateful
and
helpful
to
me
some
men
i
believe
would
have
been
driven
frantic
under
the
circumstances
to
me
anything
like
a
musical
sound
always
came
as
a
godsend
it
tuned
my
thoughts
it
made
the
words
flow
even
the
street
organs
put
me
in
a
happy
mood
i
owe
many
a
page
to
them
written
when
i
should
else
have
been
sunk
in
bilious
gloom
more
than
once
too
when
i
was
walking
london
streets
by
night
penniless
and
miserable
music
from
an
open
window
has
stayed
my
step
even
as
yesterday
very
well
can
i
remember
such
a
moment
in
eaton
square
one
night
when
i
was
going
back
to
chelsea
tired
hungry
racked
by
frustrate
passions
i
had
tramped
miles
and
miles
in
the
hope
of
wearying
myself
so
that
i
could
sleep
and
forget
then
came
the
piano
notes
i
saw
that
there
was
festival
in
the
house
and
for
an
hour
or
so
i
revelled
as
none
of
the
bidden
guests
could
possibly
be
doing
and
when
i
reached
my
poor
lodgings
i
was
no
longer
envious
nor
mad
with
desires
but
as
i
fell
asleep
i
thanked
the
unknown
mortal
who
had
played
for
me
and
given
me
peace
xxvii
i
have
read
it
is
perhaps
the
play
that
i
love
best
and
because
i
seem
to
myself
to
know
it
so
well
i
commonly
pass
it
over
in
opening
the
book
yet
as
always
in
regard
to
shakespeare
having
read
it
once
more
i
find
that
my
knowledge
was
less
complete
than
i
supposed
so
it
would
be
live
as
long
as
one
might
so
it
would
ever
be
whilst
one
had
strength
to
turn
the
pages
and
a
mind
left
to
read
them
i
like
to
believe
that
this
was
the
poet
last
work
that
he
wrote
it
in
his
home
at
stratford
walking
day
by
day
in
the
fields
which
had
taught
his
boyhood
to
love
rural
england
it
is
ripe
fruit
of
the
supreme
imagination
perfect
craft
of
the
master
hand
for
a
man
whose
business
it
has
been
to
study
the
english
tongue
what
joy
can
equal
that
of
marking
the
happy
ease
wherewith
shakespeare
surpasses
in
mere
command
of
words
every
achievement
of
those
even
who
apart
from
him
are
great
i
could
fancy
that
in
he
wrought
with
a
peculiar
consciousness
of
this
power
smiling
as
the
word
of
inimitable
felicity
the
phrase
of
incomparable
cadence
was
whispered
to
him
by
the
ariel
that
was
his
genius
he
seems
to
sport
with
language
to
amuse
himself
with
new
discovery
of
its
resources
from
king
to
beggar
men
of
every
rank
and
every
order
of
mind
have
spoken
with
his
lips
he
has
uttered
the
lore
of
fairyland
now
it
pleases
him
to
create
a
being
neither
man
nor
fairy
a
something
between
brute
and
human
nature
and
to
endow
its
purposes
with
words
these
words
how
they
smack
of
the
moist
and
spawning
earth
of
the
life
of
creatures
that
can
not
rise
above
the
soil
we
do
not
think
of
it
enough
we
stint
our
wonder
because
we
fall
short
in
appreciation
a
miracle
is
worked
before
us
and
we
scarce
give
heed
it
has
become
familiar
to
our
minds
as
any
other
of
marvels
which
we
rarely
pause
to
reflect
upon
contains
the
noblest
meditative
passage
in
all
the
plays
that
which
embodies
shakespeare
final
view
of
life
and
is
the
inevitable
quotation
of
all
who
would
sum
the
teachings
of
philosophy
it
contains
his
most
exquisite
lyrics
his
tenderest
love
passages
and
one
glimpse
of
fairyland
which
i
can
not
but
think
outshines
the
utmost
beauty
of
midsummer
night
prospero
farewell
to
the
elves
of
hills
brooks
standing
lakes
and
groves
again
a
miracle
these
are
things
which
can
not
be
staled
by
repetition
come
to
them
often
as
you
will
they
are
ever
fresh
as
though
new
minted
from
the
brain
of
the
poet
being
perfect
they
can
never
droop
under
that
satiety
which
arises
from
the
perception
of
fault
their
virtue
can
never
be
so
entirely
savoured
as
to
leave
no
pungency
of
gusto
for
the
next
approach
among
the
many
reasons
which
make
me
glad
to
have
been
born
in
england
one
of
the
first
is
that
i
read
shakespeare
in
my
mother
tongue
if
i
try
to
imagine
myself
as
one
who
can
not
know
him
face
to
face
who
hears
him
only
speaking
from
afar
and
that
in
accents
which
only
through
the
labouring
intelligence
can
touch
the
living
soul
there
comes
upon
me
a
sense
of
chill
discouragement
of
dreary
deprivation
i
am
wont
to
think
that
i
can
read
homer
and
assuredly
if
any
man
enjoys
him
it
is
i
but
can
i
for
a
moment
dream
that
homer
yields
me
all
his
music
that
his
word
is
to
me
as
to
him
who
walked
by
the
hellenic
shore
when
hellas
lived
i
know
that
there
reaches
me
across
the
vast
of
time
no
more
than
a
faint
and
broken
echo
i
know
that
it
would
be
fainter
still
but
for
its
blending
with
those
memories
of
youth
which
are
as
a
glimmer
of
the
world
primeval
glory
let
every
land
have
joy
of
its
poet
for
the
poet
is
the
land
itself
all
its
greatness
and
its
sweetness
all
that
incommunicable
heritage
for
which
men
live
and
die
as
i
close
the
book
love
and
reverence
possess
me
whether
does
my
full
heart
turn
to
the
great
enchanter
or
to
the
island
upon
which
he
has
laid
his
spell
i
know
not
i
can
not
think
of
them
apart
in
the
love
and
reverence
awakened
by
that
voice
of
voices
shakespeare
and
england
are
but
one
autumn
i
this
has
been
a
year
of
long
sunshine
month
has
followed
upon
month
with
little
unkindness
of
the
sky
i
scarcely
marked
when
july
passed
into
august
august
into
september
i
should
think
it
summer
still
but
that
i
see
the
lanes
with
flowers
of
autumn
i
am
busy
with
the
hawkweeds
that
is
to
say
i
am
learning
to
distinguish
and
to
name
as
many
as
i
can
for
scientific
classification
i
have
little
mind
it
does
not
happen
to
fall
in
with
my
habits
of
thought
but
i
like
to
be
able
to
give
its
name
the
trivial
by
choice
to
every
flower
i
meet
in
my
walks
why
should
i
be
content
to
say
oh
it
a
hawkweed
that
is
but
one
degree
less
ungracious
than
if
i
dismissed
all
the
as
dandelions
i
feel
as
if
the
flower
were
pleased
by
my
recognition
of
its
personality
seeing
how
much
i
owe
them
one
and
all
the
least
i
can
do
is
to
greet
them
severally
for
the
same
reason
i
had
rather
say
hawkweed
than
hieracium
the
homelier
word
has
more
of
kindly
friendship
ii
how
the
mood
for
a
book
sometimes
rushes
upon
one
either
one
knows
not
why
or
in
consequence
perhaps
of
some
most
trifling
suggestion
yesterday
i
was
walking
at
dusk
i
came
to
an
old
farmhouse
at
the
garden
gate
a
vehicle
stood
waiting
and
i
saw
it
was
our
doctor
gig
having
passed
i
turned
to
look
back
there
was
a
faint
afterglow
in
the
sky
beyond
the
chimneys
a
light
twinkled
at
one
of
the
upper
windows
i
said
to
myself
tristram
shandy
and
hurried
home
to
plunge
into
a
book
which
i
have
not
opened
for
i
dare
say
twenty
years
not
long
ago
i
awoke
one
morning
and
suddenly
thought
of
the
correspondence
between
goethe
and
schiller
and
so
impatient
did
i
become
to
open
the
book
that
i
got
up
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
a
book
worth
rising
for
much
better
worth
than
old
burton
who
pulled
johnson
out
of
bed
a
book
which
helps
one
to
forget
the
idle
or
venomous
chatter
going
on
everywhere
about
us
and
bids
us
cherish
hope
for
a
world
which
has
such
people
i
these
volumes
i
had
at
hand
i
could
reach
them
down
from
my
shelves
at
the
moment
when
i
hungered
for
them
but
it
often
happens
that
the
book
which
comes
into
my
mind
could
only
be
procured
with
trouble
and
delay
i
breathe
regretfully
and
put
aside
the
thought
ah
the
books
that
one
will
never
read
again
they
gave
delight
perchance
something
more
they
left
a
perfume
in
the
memory
but
life
has
passed
them
by
for
ever
i
have
but
to
muse
and
one
after
another
they
rise
before
me
books
gentle
and
quieting
books
noble
and
inspiring
books
that
well
merit
to
be
pored
over
not
once
but
many
a
time
yet
never
again
shall
i
hold
them
in
my
hand
the
years
fly
too
quickly
and
are
too
few
perhaps
when
i
lie
waiting
for
the
end
some
of
those
lost
books
will
come
into
my
wandering
thoughts
and
i
shall
remember
them
as
friends
to
whom
i
owed
a
kindness
friends
passed
upon
the
way
what
regret
in
that
last
farewell
iii
every
one
i
suppose
is
subject
to
a
trick
of
mind
which
often
puzzles
me
i
am
reading
or
thinking
and
at
a
moment
without
any
association
or
suggestion
that
i
can
discover
there
rises
before
me
the
vision
of
a
place
i
know
impossible
to
explain
why
that
particular
spot
should
show
itself
to
my
mind
eye
the
cerebral
impulse
is
so
subtle
that
no
search
may
trace
its
origin
if
i
am
reading
doubtless
a
thought
a
phrase
possibly
a
mere
word
on
the
page
before
me
serves
to
awaken
memory
if
i
am
otherwise
occupied
it
must
be
an
object
seen
an
odour
a
touch
perhaps
even
a
posture
of
the
body
suffices
to
recall
something
in
the
past
sometimes
the
vision
passes
and
there
an
end
sometimes
however
it
has
successors
the
memory
working
quite
independently
of
my
will
and
no
link
appearing
between
one
scene
and
the
next
ten
minutes
ago
i
was
talking
with
my
gardener
our
topic
was
the
nature
of
the
soil
whether
or
not
it
would
suit
a
certain
kind
of
vegetable
of
a
sudden
i
found
myself
gazing
at
the
bay
of
avlona
quite
certainly
my
thoughts
had
not
strayed
in
that
direction
the
picture
that
came
before
me
caused
me
a
shock
of
surprise
and
i
am
still
vainly
trying
to
discover
how
i
came
to
behold
it
a
happy
chance
that
i
ever
saw
avlona
i
was
on
my
way
from
corfu
to
brindisi
the
steamer
sailed
late
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
little
wind
and
as
the
december
night
became
chilly
i
soon
turned
in
with
the
first
daylight
i
was
on
deck
expecting
to
find
that
we
were
near
the
italian
port
to
my
surprise
i
saw
a
mountainous
shore
towards
which
the
ship
was
making
at
full
speed
on
inquiry
i
learnt
that
this
was
the
coast
of
albania
our
vessel
not
being
very
seaworthy
and
the
wind
still
blowing
a
little
though
not
enough
to
make
any
passenger
uncomfortable
the
captain
had
turned
back
when
nearly
half
across
the
adriatic
and
was
seeking
a
haven
in
the
shelter
of
the
hills
presently
we
steamed
into
a
great
bay
in
the
narrow
mouth
of
which
lay
an
island
my
map
showed
me
where
we
were
and
with
no
small
interest
i
discovered
that
the
long
line
of
heights
guarding
the
bay
on
its
southern
side
formed
the
acroceraunian
promontory
a
little
town
visible
high
up
on
the
inner
shore
was
the
ancient
aulon
here
we
anchored
and
lay
all
day
long
provisions
running
short
a
boat
had
to
be
sent
to
land
and
the
sailors
purchased
among
other
things
some
peculiarly
detestable
bread
according
to
them
al
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
till
evening
the
wind
whistled
above
our
heads
but
the
sea
about
us
was
blue
and
smooth
i
sat
in
hot
sunshine
feasting
my
eyes
on
the
beautiful
cliffs
and
valleys
of
the
shore
then
came
a
noble
sunset
then
night
crept
gently
into
the
hollows
of
the
hills
which
now
were
coloured
the
deepest
richest
green
a
little
lighthouse
began
to
shine
in
the
perfect
calm
that
had
fallen
i
heard
breakers
murmuring
softly
upon
the
beach
at
sunrise
we
entered
the
port
of
brindisi
iv
the
characteristic
motive
of
english
poetry
is
love
of
nature
especially
of
nature
as
seen
in
the
english
rural
landscape
from
the
cuckoo
song
of
our
language
in
its
beginnings
to
the
perfect
loveliness
of
best
verse
this
note
is
ever
sounding
it
is
persistent
even
amid
the
triumph
of
the
drama
take
away
from
shakespeare
all
his
bits
of
natural
description
all
his
casual
allusions
to
the
life
and
aspects
of
the
country
and
what
a
loss
were
there
the
reign
of
the
iambic
couplet
confined
but
could
not
suppress
this
native
music
pope
notwithstanding
there
came
the
ode
to
evening
and
that
elegy
which
unsurpassed
for
beauty
of
thought
and
nobility
of
utterance
in
all
the
treasury
of
our
lyrics
remains
perhaps
the
most
essentially
english
poem
ever
written
this
attribute
of
our
national
mind
availed
even
to
give
rise
to
an
english
school
of
painting
it
came
late
that
it
ever
came
at
all
is
remarkable
enough
a
people
apparently
less
apt
for
that
kind
of
achievement
never
existed
so
profound
is
the
english
joy
in
meadow
and
stream
and
hill
that
unsatisfied
at
last
with
vocal
expression
it
took
up
the
brush
the
pencil
the
etching
tool
and
created
a
new
form
of
art
the
national
gallery
represents
only
in
a
very
imperfect
way
the
richness
and
variety
of
our
landscape
work
were
it
possible
to
collect
and
suitably
to
display
the
very
best
of
such
work
in
every
vehicle
i
know
not
which
would
be
the
stronger
emotion
in
an
english
heart
pride
or
rapture
one
obvious
reason
for
the
long
neglect
of
turner
lies
in
the
fact
that
his
genius
does
not
seem
to
be
truly
english
turner
landscape
even
when
it
presents
familiar
scenes
does
not
show
them
in
the
familiar
light
neither
the
artist
nor
the
intelligent
layman
is
satisfied
he
gives
us
glorious
visions
we
admit
the
glory
but
we
miss
something
which
we
deem
essential
i
doubt
whether
turner
tasted
rural
england
i
doubt
whether
the
spirit
of
english
poetry
was
in
him
i
doubt
whether
the
essential
significance
of
the
common
things
which
we
call
beautiful
was
revealed
to
his
soul
such
doubt
does
not
affect
his
greatness
as
a
poet
in
colour
and
in
form
but
i
suspect
that
it
has
always
been
the
cause
why
england
could
not
love
him
if
any
man
whom
i
knew
to
be
a
man
of
brains
confessed
to
me
that
he
preferred
birket
foster
i
should
smile
but
i
should
understand
a
long
time
since
i
wrote
in
this
book
in
september
i
caught
a
cold
which
meant
three
weeks
illness
i
have
not
been
suffering
merely
feverish
and
weak
and
unable
to
use
my
mind
for
anything
but
a
daily
hour
or
two
of
the
lightest
reading
the
weather
has
not
favoured
my
recovery
wet
winds
often
blowing
and
not
much
sun
lying
in
bed
i
have
watched
the
sky
studied
the
clouds
which
so
long
as
they
are
clouds
indeed
and
not
a
mere
waste
of
grey
vapour
always
have
their
beauty
inability
to
read
has
always
been
my
horror
once
a
trouble
of
the
eyes
all
but
drove
me
mad
with
fear
of
blindness
but
i
find
that
in
my
present
circumstances
in
my
own
still
house
with
no
intrusion
to
be
dreaded
with
no
task
or
care
to
worry
me
i
can
fleet
the
time
not
unpleasantly
even
without
help
of
books
reverie
unknown
to
me
in
the
days
of
bondage
has
brought
me
solace
i
hope
it
has
a
little
advanced
me
in
wisdom
for
not
surely
by
deliberate
effort
of
thought
does
a
man
grow
wise
the
truths
of
life
are
not
discovered
by
us
at
moments
unforeseen
some
gracious
influence
descends
upon
the
soul
touching
it
to
an
emotion
which
we
know
not
how
the
mind
transmutes
into
thought
this
can
happen
only
in
a
calm
of
the
senses
a
surrender
of
the
whole
being
to
passionless
contemplation
i
understand
now
the
intellectual
mood
of
the
quietist
of
course
my
good
housekeeper
has
tended
me
perfectly
with
the
minimum
of
needless
talk
wonderful
woman
if
the
evidence
of
a
life
is
necessarily
seen
in
honour
love
obedience
troops
of
friends
mine
it
is
clear
has
fallen
short
of
a
moderate
ideal
friends
i
have
had
and
have
but
very
few
honour
and
obedience
why
by
a
stretch
m
may
perchance
represent
these
blessings
as
for
love
let
me
tell
myself
the
truth
do
i
really
believe
that
at
any
time
of
my
life
i
have
been
the
kind
of
man
who
merits
affection
i
think
not
i
have
always
been
much
too
too
critical
of
all
about
me
too
unreasonably
proud
such
men
as
i
live
and
die
alone
however
much
in
appearance
accompanied
i
do
not
repine
at
it
nay
lying
day
after
day
in
solitude
and
silence
i
have
felt
glad
that
it
was
so
at
least
i
give
no
one
trouble
and
that
is
much
most
solemnly
do
i
hope
that
in
the
latter
days
no
long
illness
awaits
me
may
i
pass
quickly
from
this
life
of
quiet
enjoyment
to
the
final
peace
so
shall
no
one
think
of
me
with
pained
sympathy
or
with
weariness
one
two
even
three
may
possibly
feel
regret
come
the
end
how
it
may
but
i
do
not
flatter
myself
that
to
them
i
am
more
than
an
object
of
kindly
thought
at
long
intervals
it
is
enough
it
signifies
that
i
have
not
erred
wholly
and
when
i
think
that
my
daily
life
testifies
to
an
act
of
kindness
such
as
i
could
never
have
dreamt
of
meriting
from
the
man
who
performed
it
may
i
not
be
much
more
than
content
vi
how
i
envy
those
who
become
prudent
without
thwackings
of
experience
such
men
seem
to
be
not
uncommon
i
do
mean
calculators
of
profit
and
loss
in
life
possibilities
nor
yet
the
plodding
dull
who
never
have
imagination
enough
to
quit
the
beaten
track
of
security
but
and
fellows
who
seem
always
to
be
led
by
common
sense
who
go
steadily
from
stage
to
stage
of
life
doing
the
right
the
prudent
things
guilty
of
no
vagaries
winning
respect
by
natural
progress
seldom
needing
aid
themselves
often
helpful
to
others
and
through
all
deliberate
happy
how
i
envy
them
for
of
myself
it
might
be
said
that
whatever
folly
is
possible
to
a
moneyless
man
that
folly
i
have
at
one
time
or
another
committed
within
my
nature
there
seemed
to
be
no
faculty
of
rational
boy
and
man
i
blundered
into
every
ditch
and
bog
which
lay
within
sight
of
my
way
never
did
silly
mortal
reap
such
harvest
of
experience
never
had
any
one
so
many
bruises
to
show
for
it
thwack
thwack
no
sooner
had
i
recovered
from
one
sound
drubbing
than
i
put
myself
in
the
way
of
another
unpractical
i
was
called
by
those
who
spoke
mildly
idiot
i
am
sure
by
many
a
ruder
tongue
and
idiot
i
see
myself
whenever
i
glance
back
over
the
long
devious
road
something
obviously
i
lacked
from
the
beginning
some
balancing
principle
granted
to
most
men
in
one
or
another
degree
i
had
brains
but
they
were
no
help
to
me
in
the
common
circumstances
of
life
but
for
the
good
fortune
which
plucked
me
out
of
my
mazes
and
set
me
in
paradise
i
should
no
doubt
have
blundered
on
to
the
end
the
last
thwack
of
experience
would
have
laid
me
low
just
when
i
was
becoming
really
a
prudent
man
vii
this
morning
sunshine
faded
amid
clouds
but
something
of
its
light
seems
still
to
linger
in
the
air
and
to
touch
the
rain
which
is
falling
softly
i
hear
a
pattering
upon
the
still
leafage
of
the
garden
it
is
a
sound
which
lulls
and
tunes
the
mind
to
calm
thoughtfulness
i
have
a
letter
from
my
old
friend
in
germany
b
for
many
and
many
a
year
these
letters
have
made
a
pleasant
incident
in
my
life
more
than
that
they
have
often
brought
me
help
and
comfort
it
must
be
a
rare
thing
for
friendly
correspondence
to
go
on
during
the
greater
part
of
a
lifetime
between
men
of
different
nationalities
who
see
each
other
not
twice
in
two
decades
we
were
young
men
when
we
first
met
in
london
poor
struggling
full
of
hopes
and
ideals
now
we
look
back
upon
those
far
memories
from
the
autumn
of
life
writes
in
a
vein
of
quiet
contentment
which
does
me
good
he
quotes
goethe
man
in
der
jugend
begehrt
hat
man
im
alter
die
these
words
of
goethe
were
once
a
hope
to
me
later
they
made
me
shake
my
head
incredulously
now
i
smile
to
think
how
true
they
have
proved
in
my
own
case
but
what
exactly
do
they
mean
are
they
merely
an
expression
of
the
optimistic
spirit
if
so
optimism
has
to
content
itself
with
rather
doubtful
generalities
can
it
truly
be
said
that
most
men
find
the
wishes
of
their
youth
satisfied
in
later
life
ten
years
ago
i
should
have
utterly
denied
it
and
could
have
brought
what
seemed
to
me
abundant
evidence
in
its
disproof
and
as
regards
myself
is
it
not
by
mere
happy
accident
that
i
pass
my
latter
years
in
such
enjoyment
of
all
i
most
desired
accident
but
there
is
no
such
thing
i
might
just
as
well
have
called
it
an
accident
had
i
succeeded
in
earning
the
money
on
which
now
i
live
from
the
beginning
of
my
manhood
it
is
true
i
longed
for
bookish
leisure
that
assuredly
is
seldom
even
one
of
the
desires
in
a
young
man
heart
but
perhaps
it
is
one
of
those
which
may
most
reasonably
look
for
gratification
later
on
what
however
of
the
multitudes
who
aim
only
at
wealth
for
the
power
and
the
pride
and
the
material
pleasures
which
it
represents
we
know
very
well
that
few
indeed
are
successful
in
that
aim
and
missing
it
do
they
not
miss
everything
for
them
are
not
goethe
words
mere
mockery
apply
them
to
mankind
at
large
and
perhaps
after
all
they
are
true
the
fact
of
national
prosperity
and
contentment
implies
necessarily
the
prosperity
and
contentment
of
the
greater
number
of
the
individuals
of
which
the
nation
consists
in
other
words
the
average
man
who
is
past
middle
life
has
obtained
what
he
strove
for
success
in
his
calling
as
a
young
man
he
would
not
perhaps
have
set
forth
his
aspirations
so
moderately
but
do
they
not
as
a
fact
amount
to
this
in
defence
of
the
optimistic
view
one
may
urge
how
rare
it
is
to
meet
with
an
elderly
man
who
harbours
a
repining
spirit
true
but
i
have
always
regarded
as
a
fact
of
infinite
pathos
the
ability
men
have
to
subdue
themselves
to
the
conditions
of
life
contentment
so
often
means
resignation
abandonment
of
the
hope
seen
to
be
forbidden
i
can
not
resolve
this
doubt
viii
i
have
been
reading
a
book
i
have
often
thought
of
reading
but
its
length
and
my
slight
interest
in
that
period
always
held
me
aloof
happily
chance
and
mood
came
together
and
i
am
richer
by
a
bit
of
knowledge
well
worth
acquiring
it
is
the
kind
of
book
which
one
may
reasonably
say
tends
to
edification
one
is
better
for
having
lived
a
while
with
messieurs
de
the
best
of
them
were
surely
not
far
from
the
kingdom
of
heaven
theirs
is
not
indeed
the
christianity
of
the
first
age
we
are
among
theologians
and
the
shadow
of
dogma
has
dimmed
those
divine
hues
of
the
early
morning
yet
ever
and
anon
there
comes
a
cool
sweet
air
which
seems
not
to
have
blown
across
man
common
world
which
bears
no
taint
of
mortality
a

nicole

spirits
of
exquisite
humility
and

a
perfume
rises
from
the
page
as
one
reads
about
them
but
best
of
all
i
like
de
tillemont
i
could
have
wished
for
myself
even
such
a
life
as
his
wrapped
in
silence
and
calm
a
life
of
gentle
devotion
and
zealous
study
from
the
age
of
fourteen
he
said
his
intellect
had
occupied
itself
with
but
one
subject
that
of
ecclesiastical
history
rising
at
four
he
read
and
wrote
until
nine
in
the
evening
interrupting
his
work
only
to
say
the
offices
of
the
church
and
for
a
couple
of
breathing
at
few
were
his
absences
when
he
had
to
make
a
journey
he
set
forth
on
foot
staff
in
hand
and
lightened
the
way
by
singing
to
himself
a
psalm
or
canticle
this
man
of
profound
erudition
had
as
pure
and
simple
a
heart
as
ever
dwelt
in
mortal
he
loved
to
stop
by
the
road
and
talk
with
children
and
knew
how
to
hold
their
attention
whilst
teaching
them
a
lesson
seeing
boy
or
girl
in
charge
of
a
cow
he
would
ask
how
is
it
that
you
a
little
child
are
able
to
control
that
animal
so
much
bigger
and
stronger
and
he
would
show
the
reason
speaking
of
the
human
soul
all
this
about
tillemont
is
new
to
me
well
as
i
knew
his
name
from
the
pages
of
gibbon
i
thought
of
him
merely
as
the
laborious
and
accurate
compiler
of
historical
materials
admirable
as
was
his
work
the
spirit
in
which
he
performed
it
is
the
thing
to
dwell
upon
he
studied
for
study
sake
and
with
no
aim
but
truth
to
him
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
his
learning
ever
became
known
among
men
and
at
any
moment
he
would
have
given
the
fruits
of
his
labour
to
any
one
capable
of
making
use
of
them
think
of
the
world
in
which
the
jansenists
were
living
the
world
of
the
fronde
of
richelieu
and
mazarin
of
his
refulgent
majesty
louis
xiv
contrast
with
versailles
and
whatever
one
judgment
of
their
religious
and
ecclesiastical
aims
one
must
needs
say
that
these
men
lived
with
dignity
the
great
monarch
is
in
comparison
a
poor
sordid
creature
one
thinks
of
moliere
refused
burial
the
contemptuous
indifference
for
one
who
could
do
no
more
to
amuse
him
being
a
true
measure
of
the
royal
greatness
face
to
face
with
even
the
least
of
these
grave
and
pious
men
how
paltry
and
unclean
are
all
those
courtly
figures
not
was
dignity
in
the
palace
chambers
and
the
stately
gardens
but
in
the
poor
rooms
where
the
solitaries
of
prayed
and
studied
and
taught
whether
or
not
the
ideal
for
mankind
their
life
was
worthy
of
man
and
what
is
rarer
than
a
life
to
which
that
praise
can
be
given
ix
it
is
amusing
to
note
the
superficial
forms
of
reaction
against
scientific
positivism
the
triumph
of
darwin
was
signalized
by
the
invention
of
that
happy
word
agnostic
which
had
great
vogue
but
agnosticism
as
a
fashion
was
far
too
reasonable
to
endure
there
came
a
rumour
of
oriental
magic
how
the
world
repeats
itself
and
presently
every
one
who
had
nothing
better
to
do
gossipped
about
esoteric
buddhism
the
saving
adjective
sounded
well
in
a
it
did
not
hold
very
long
even
with
the
novelists
for
the
english
taste
this
esotericism
was
too
exotic
somebody
suggested
that
the
old
and
which
had
homely
associations
might
be
in
a
scientific
light
and
the
idea
was
seized
upon
superstition
pranked
in
the
professor
spectacles
it
set
up
a
laboratory
and
printed
grave
reports
day
by
day
its
sphere
widened
hypnotism
brought
matter
for
the
and
there
followed
a
long
procession
of
words
in
limping
greek
a
little
difficult
till
practice
had
made
perfect
another
fortunate
terminologist
hit
upon
the
word
psychical
the
might
be
sounded
or
not
according
to
the
taste
and
fancy
of
the
pronouncer
and
the
fashionable
children
of
a
scientific
age
were
thoroughly
at
ease
there
be
something
you
know
one
always
felt
that
there
be
something
and
now
if
one
may
judge
from
what
one
reads
psychical
science
is
comfortably
joining
hands
with
the
sorcery
of
the
middle
ages
it
is
said
to
be
a
lucrative
moment
for
wizards
that
peep
and
that
mutter
if
the
law
against
were
as
strictly
enforced
in
the
polite
world
as
it
occasionally
is
in
slums
and
hamlets
we
should
have
a
merry
time
but
it
is
difficult
to
prosecute
a
professor
of
telepathy
and
how
he
would
welcome
the
advertisement
of
course
i
know
very
well
that
all
that
make
use
of
these
words
are
not
in
one
and
the
same
category
there
is
a
study
of
the
human
mind
in
health
and
in
disease
which
calls
for
as
much
respect
as
any
other
study
conscientiously
and
capably
pursued
that
it
lends
occasion
to
fribbles
and
knaves
is
no
argument
against
any
honest
tendency
of
thought
men
whom
one
can
not
but
esteem
are
deeply
engaged
in
psychical
investigations
and
have
convinced
themselves
that
they
are
brought
into
touch
with
phenomena
inexplicable
by
the
commonly
accepted
laws
of
life
be
it
so
they
may
be
on
the
point
of
making
discoveries
in
the
world
beyond
sense
for
my
own
part
everything
of
this
kind
not
only
does
not
interest
me
i
turn
from
it
with
the
strongest
distaste
if
every
story
examined
by
the
psychical
society
were
set
before
me
with
irresistible
evidence
of
its
truth
my
feeling
call
it
my
prejudice
would
undergo
no
change
whatever
no
whit
the
less
should
i
yawn
over
the
next
batch
and
lay
the
narratives
aside
with
yes
with
a
sort
of
disgust
an
ounce
of
civet
good
apothecary
why
it
should
be
so
with
me
i
can
not
say
i
am
as
indifferent
to
the
facts
or
fancies
of
spiritualism
as
i
am
for
instance
to
the
latest
mechanical
application
of
electricity
edisons
and
marconis
may
thrill
the
world
with
astounding
novelties
they
astound
me
as
every
one
else
but
straightway
i
forget
my
astonishment
and
am
in
every
respect
the
man
i
was
before
the
thing
has
simply
no
concern
for
me
and
i
care
not
a
if
morrow
the
proclaimed
discovery
be
proved
a
journalist
mistake
or
invention
am
i
then
a
hidebound
materialist
if
i
know
myself
hardly
that
once
in
conversation
with
i
referred
to
his
position
as
that
of
the
agnostic
he
corrected
me
the
agnostic
grants
that
there
be
something
beyond
the
sphere
of
man
knowledge
i
can
make
no
such
admission
for
me
what
is
called
the
unknowable
is
simply
the
we
see
what
is
and
we
see
all
now
this
gave
me
a
sort
of
shock
it
seemed
incredible
to
me
that
a
man
of
so
much
intelligence
could
hold
such
a
view
so
far
am
i
from
feeling
satisfied
with
any
explanation
scientific
or
other
of
myself
and
of
the
world
about
me
that
not
a
day
goes
by
but
i
fall
before
the
mystery
of
the
universe
to
trumpet
the
triumphs
of
human
knowledge
seems
to
me
worse
than
childishness
now
as
of
old
we
know
but
one
thing
that
we
know
nothing
what
can
i
pluck
the
flower
by
the
wayside
and
as
i
gaze
at
it
feel
that
if
i
knew
all
the
teachings
of
histology
morphology
and
so
on
with
regard
to
it
i
should
have
exhausted
its
meanings
what
is
all
this
but
words
words
words
interesting
yes
as
observation
but
the
more
interesting
so
much
the
more
provocative
of
wonder
and
of
hopeless
questioning
one
may
gaze
and
think
till
the
brain
whirls
till
the
little
blossom
in
one
hand
becomes
as
overwhelming
a
miracle
as
the
very
sun
in
heaven
nothing
to
be
known
the
flower
simply
a
flower
and
there
an
end
o
the
man
simply
a
product
of
evolutionary
law
his
senses
and
his
intellect
merely
availing
him
to
take
account
of
the
natural
mechanism
of
which
he
forms
a
part
i
find
it
very
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
the
conviction
of
any
human
mind
rather
i
would
think
that
despair
at
an
insoluble
problem
and
perhaps
impatience
with
those
who
pretend
to
solve
it
bring
about
a
resolute
disregard
of
everything
beyond
the
physical
fact
and
so
at
length
a
which
seems
obtuseness
x
it
may
well
be
that
what
we
call
the
unknowable
will
be
for
ever
the
unknown
in
that
thought
is
there
not
a
pathos
beyond
words
it
may
be
that
the
human
race
will
live
and
pass
away
all
mankind
from
him
who
in
the
world
dawn
first
shaped
to
his
fearful
mind
an
image
of
the
lord
of
life
to
him
who
in
the
dusking
twilight
of
the
last
age
shall
crouch
before
a
deity
of
stone
or
wood
and
never
one
of
that
long
lineage
have
learnt
the
wherefore
of
his
being
the
prophets
the
martyrs
their
noble
anguish
vain
and
meaningless
the
wise
whose
thought
strove
to
eternity
and
was
but
an
idle
dream
the
pure
in
heart
whose
life
was
a
vision
of
the
living
god
the
suffering
and
the
mourners
whose
solace
was
in
a
world
to
come
the
victims
of
injustice
who
cried
to
the
judge
supreme
all
gone
down
into
silence
and
the
globe
that
bare
them
circling
dead
and
cold
through
soundless
space
the
most
tragic
aspect
of
such
a
tragedy
is
that
it
is
not
unthinkable
the
soul
revolts
but
dare
not
see
in
this
revolt
the
assurance
of
its
higher
destiny
viewing
our
life
thus
is
it
not
easier
to
believe
that
the
tragedy
is
played
with
no
spectator
and
of
a
truth
of
a
truth
what
spectator
can
there
be
the
day
may
come
when
to
all
who
live
the
name
of
names
will
be
but
an
empty
symbol
rejected
by
reason
and
by
faith
yet
the
tragedy
will
be
played
on
it
is
not
i
say
unthinkable
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
to
declare
that
life
has
no
meaning
beyond
the
sense
it
bears
to
human
intelligence
the
intelligence
itself
rejects
such
a
supposition
in
my
case
with
impatience
and
scorn
no
theory
of
the
world
which
ever
came
to
my
knowledge
is
to
me
for
one
moment
acceptable
the
possibility
of
an
explanation
which
would
set
my
mind
at
rest
is
to
me
inconceivable
no
whit
the
less
am
i
convinced
that
there
is
a
reason
of
the
all
one
which
transcends
my
understanding
one
no
glimmer
of
which
will
ever
touch
my
apprehension
a
reason
which
must
imply
a
creative
power
and
therefore
even
whilst
a
necessity
of
my
thought
is
by
the
same
criticized
into
nothing
a
like
antinomy
with
that
which
affects
our
conception
of
the
infinite
in
time
and
space
whether
the
rational
processes
have
reached
their
final
development
who
shall
say
perhaps
what
seem
to
us
the
impassable
limits
of
thought
are
but
the
conditions
of
a
yet
early
stage
in
the
history
of
man
those
who
make
them
a
proof
of
a
future
state
must
necessarily
suppose
gradations
in
that
futurity
does
the
savage
scarce
risen
above
the
brute
enter
upon
the
same
new
life
as
the
man
of
highest
civilization
such
gropings
of
the
mind
certify
our
ignorance
the
strange
thing
is
that
they
can
be
held
by
any
one
to
demonstrate
that
our
ignorance
is
final
knowledge
xi
yet
that
perhaps
will
be
the
mind
of
coming
man
if
not
the
final
attainment
of
his
intellectual
progress
at
all
events
a
long
period
of
assumed
as
finality
we
talk
of
the
ever
aspiring
soul
we
take
for
granted
that
if
one
religion
passes
away
another
must
arise
but
what
if
man
presently
find
himself
without
spiritual
needs
such
modification
of
his
being
can
not
be
deemed
impossible
many
signs
of
our
life
seem
to
point
towards
it
if
the
habits
of
thought
favoured
by
physical
science
do
but
sink
deep
enough
and
no
vast
calamity
come
to
check
mankind
in
its
advance
to
material
contentment
the
age
of
true
positivism
may
arise
then
it
will
be
the
common
privilege
rerum
cognoscere
causas
the
word
supernatural
will
have
no
sense
superstition
will
be
a
dimly
understood
trait
of
the
early
race
and
where
now
we
perceive
an
appalling
mystery
everything
will
be
lucid
and
serene
as
a
geometric
demonstration
such
an
epoch
of
reason
might
be
the
happiest
the
world
could
know
indeed
it
would
either
be
that
or
it
would
never
come
about
at
all
for
suffering
and
sorrow
are
the
great
doctors
of
metaphysic
and
remembering
this
one
can
not
count
very
surely
upon
the
rationalist
millennium
xii
the
free
man
says
spinoza
thinks
of
nothing
less
often
than
of
death
free
in
his
sense
of
the
word
i
may
not
call
myself
i
think
of
death
very
often
the
thought
indeed
is
ever
in
the
background
of
my
mind
yet
free
in
another
sense
i
assuredly
am
for
death
inspires
me
with
no
fear
there
was
a
time
when
i
dreaded
it
but
that
merely
because
it
meant
disaster
to
others
who
depended
upon
my
labour
the
cessation
of
being
has
never
in
itself
had
power
to
afflict
me
pain
i
can
not
well
endure
and
i
do
indeed
think
with
apprehension
of
being
subjected
to
the
trial
of
long
deathbed
torments
it
is
a
sorry
thing
that
the
man
who
has
fronted
destiny
with
something
of
manly
calm
throughout
a
life
of
stress
and
of
striving
may
when
he
nears
the
end
be
dishonoured
by
a
weakness
which
is
mere
disease
but
happily
i
am
not
often
troubled
by
that
dark
anticipation
i
always
turn
out
of
my
way
to
walk
through
a
country
churchyard
these
rural
are
as
attractive
to
me
as
a
town
cemetery
is
repugnant
i
read
the
names
upon
the
stones
and
find
a
deep
solace
in
thinking
that
for
all
these
the
fret
and
the
fear
of
life
are
over
there
comes
to
me
no
touch
of
sadness
whether
it
be
a
little
child
or
an
aged
man
i
have
the
same
sense
of
happy
accomplishment
the
end
having
come
and
with
it
the
eternal
peace
what
matter
if
it
came
late
or
soon
there
is
no
such
gratulation
as
there
is
no
such
dignity
as
that
of
death
in
the
path
trodden
by
the
noblest
of
mankind
these
have
followed
that
which
of
all
who
live
is
the
utmost
thing
demanded
these
have
achieved
i
can
not
sorrow
for
them
but
the
thought
of
their
vanished
life
moves
me
to
a
brotherly
tenderness
the
dead
amid
this
leafy
silence
seem
to
whisper
encouragement
to
him
whose
fate
yet
lingers
as
we
are
so
shalt
thou
be
and
behold
our
quiet
xiii
many
a
time
when
life
went
hard
with
me
i
have
betaken
myself
to
the
stoics
and
not
all
in
vain
marcus
aurelius
has
often
been
one
of
my
bedside
books
i
have
read
him
in
the
night
watches
when
i
could
not
sleep
for
misery
and
when
assuredly
i
could
have
read
nothing
else
he
did
not
remove
my
burden
his
proofs
of
the
vanity
of
earthly
troubles
availed
me
nothing
but
there
was
a
soothing
harmony
in
his
thought
which
partly
lulled
my
mind
and
the
mere
wish
that
i
could
find
strength
to
emulate
that
high
example
though
i
knew
that
i
never
should
was
in
itself
a
safeguard
against
the
baser
impulses
of
wretchedness
i
read
him
still
but
with
no
turbid
emotion
thinking
rather
of
the
man
than
of
the
philosophy
and
holding
his
image
dear
in
my
heart
of
hearts
of
course
the
intellectual
assumption
which
makes
his
system
untenable
by
the
thinker
of
our
time
is
that
we
possess
a
knowledge
of
the
absolute
noble
is
the
belief
that
by
exercise
of
his
reason
a
man
may
enter
into
communion
with
that
rational
essence
which
is
the
soul
of
the
world
but
precisely
because
of
our
inability
to
find
within
ourselves
any
such
sure
and
certain
guidance
do
we
of
accept
the
barren
doom
of
scepticism
otherwise
the
stoic
sense
of
man
subordination
in
the
universal
scheme
and
of
the
destiny
brings
him
into
touch
with
our
own
philosophical
views
and
his
doctrine
concerning
the
sociable
nature
of
man
of
the
reciprocal
obligations
which
exist
between
all
who
live
are
entirely
congenial
to
the
better
spirit
of
our
day
his
fatalism
is
not
mere
resignation
one
has
not
only
to
accept
one
lot
whatever
it
is
as
inevitable
but
to
accept
it
with
joy
with
praises
why
are
we
here
for
the
same
reason
that
has
brought
about
the
existence
of
a
horse
or
of
a
vine
to
play
the
part
allotted
to
us
by
nature
as
it
is
within
our
power
to
understand
the
order
of
things
so
are
we
capable
of
guiding
ourselves
in
accordance
therewith
the
will
powerless
over
circumstance
is
free
to
determine
the
habits
of
the
soul
the
first
duty
is
its
correspondent
first
privilege
is
an
inborn
knowledge
of
the
law
of
life
but
we
are
fronted
by
that
persistent
questioner
who
will
accept
no
assumption
however
noble
in
its
character
and
beneficent
in
its
tendency
how
do
we
know
that
the
reason
of
the
stoic
is
at
harmony
with
the
world
law
i
perhaps
may
see
life
from
a
very
different
point
of
view
to
me
reason
may
dictate
not
but
i
may
find
in
the
free
exercise
of
all
my
passions
an
existence
far
more
consonant
with
what
seems
to
me
the
dictate
of
nature
i
am
proud
nature
has
made
me
so
let
my
pride
assert
itself
to
justification
i
am
strong
let
me
put
forth
my
strength
it
is
the
destiny
of
the
feeble
to
fall
before
me
on
the
other
hand
i
am
weak
and
i
suffer
what
avails
a
mere
assertion
that
fate
is
just
to
bring
about
my
calm
and
glad
acceptance
of
this
doom
nay
for
there
is
that
within
my
soul
which
bids
me
revolt
and
cry
against
the
iniquity
of
some
power
i
know
not
granting
that
i
am
compelled
to
acknowledge
a
scheme
of
things
which
constrains
me
to
this
or
that
whether
i
will
or
no
how
can
i
be
sure
that
wisdom
or
moral
duty
lies
in
acquiescence
thus
the
unceasing
questioner
to
whom
indeed
there
is
no
reply
for
our
philosophy
sees
no
longer
a
supreme
sanction
and
no
longer
hears
a
harmony
of
the
universe
he
that
is
unjust
is
also
impious
for
the
nature
of
the
universe
having
made
all
reasonable
creatures
one
for
another
to
the
end
that
they
should
do
one
another
good
more
or
less
according
to
the
several
persons
and
occasions
but
in
no
wise
hurt
one
another
it
is
manifest
that
he
that
doth
transgress
against
this
her
will
is
guilty
of
impiety
towards
the
most
ancient
and
venerable
of
all
the
deities
how
gladly
would
i
believe
this
that
injustice
is
impiety
and
indeed
the
supreme
impiety
i
will
hold
with
my
last
breath
but
it
were
the
merest
affectation
of
a
noble
sentiment
if
i
supported
my
faith
by
such
a
reasoning
i
see
no
single
piece
of
strong
testimony
that
justice
is
the
law
of
the
universe
i
see
suggestions
incalculable
tending
to
prove
that
it
is
not
rather
must
i
apprehend
that
man
in
some
inconceivable
way
may
at
his
best
moments
represent
a
principle
darkly
at
strife
with
that
which
prevails
throughout
the
world
as
known
to
us
if
the
just
man
be
in
truth
a
worshipper
of
the
most
ancient
of
deities
he
must
needs
suppose
either
that
the
object
of
his
worship
belongs
to
a
fallen
dynasty
or
what
from
of
old
has
been
his
refuge
that
the
sacred
fire
which
burns
within
him
is
an
evidence
of
things
not
seen
what
if
i
am
incapable
of
either
supposition
there
remains
the
dignity
of
a
hopeless
cause
victa
but
how
can
there
sound
the
hymn
of
praise
that
is
best
for
everyone
which
the
common
nature
of
all
doth
send
unto
everyone
and
then
is
it
best
when
she
doth
send
it
the
optimism
of
necessity
and
perhaps
the
highest
wisdom
man
can
attain
unto
remember
that
unto
reasonable
creatures
only
is
it
granted
that
they
may
willingly
and
freely
submit
no
one
could
be
more
sensible
than
i
of
the
persuasiveness
of
this
high
theme
the
words
sing
to
me
and
life
is
illumined
with
soft
glory
like
that
of
the
autumn
sunset
yonder
consider
how
man
life
is
but
for
a
very
moment
of
time
and
so
depart
meek
and
contented
even
as
if
a
ripe
olive
falling
should
praise
the
ground
that
bare
her
and
give
thanks
to
the
tree
that
begat
her
so
would
i
fain
think
when
the
moment
comes
it
is
the
mood
of
strenuous
endeavour
but
also
the
mood
of
rest
better
than
the
calm
of
achieved
indifference
if
that
indeed
is
possible
to
man
better
than
the
ecstasy
which
contemns
the
travail
of
earth
in
contemplation
of
bliss
to
come
but
by
no
effort
attainable
an
influence
of
the
unknown
powers
a
peace
that
falleth
upon
the
soul
like
dew
at
evening
xiv
i
have
had
one
of
my
savage
headaches
for
a
day
and
a
night
i
was
in
blind
torment
have
at
it
now
with
the
stoic
remedy
sickness
of
the
body
is
no
evil
with
a
little
resolution
and
considering
it
as
a
natural
issue
of
certain
natural
processes
pain
may
well
be
borne
solace
is
to
remember
that
it
can
not
affect
the
soul
which
partakes
of
the
eternal
nature
this
body
is
but
as
the
clothing
or
the
cottage
of
the
mind
let
flesh
be
racked
i
the
very
i
will
stand
apart
lord
of
myself
meanwhile
memory
reason
every
faculty
of
my
intellectual
part
is
being
whelmed
in
muddy
oblivion
is
the
soul
something
other
than
the
mind
if
so
i
have
lost
all
consciousness
of
its
existence
for
me
mind
and
soul
are
one
and
as
i
am
too
feelingly
reminded
that
element
of
my
being
is
where
the
brain
throbs
and
anguishes
a
little
more
of
such
suffering
and
i
were
myself
no
longer
the
body
representing
me
would
gesticulate
and
rave
but
i
should
know
nothing
of
its
motives
its
fantasies
the
very
i
it
is
too
plain
consists
but
with
a
certain
balance
of
my
physical
elements
which
we
call
health
even
in
the
light
beginnings
of
my
headache
i
was
already
not
myself
my
thoughts
followed
no
normal
course
and
i
was
aware
of
the
abnormality
a
few
hours
later
i
was
but
a
walking
disease
my
mind
if
one
could
use
the
word
had
become
a
grinding
in
endless
repetition
a
bar
or
two
of
idle
music
what
trust
shall
i
repose
in
the
soul
that
serves
me
thus
just
as
much
one
would
say
as
in
the
senses
through
which
i
know
all
that
i
can
know
of
the
world
in
which
i
live
and
which
for
all
i
can
tell
may
deceive
me
even
more
grossly
in
their
common
use
than
they
do
on
certain
occasions
where
i
have
power
to
test
them
just
as
much
and
no
more
if
i
am
right
in
concluding
that
mind
and
soul
are
merely
subtle
functions
of
body
if
i
chance
to
become
deranged
in
certain
parts
of
my
physical
mechanism
i
shall
straightway
be
deranged
in
my
wits
and
behold
that
something
in
me
which
partakes
of
the
eternal
prompting
me
to
pranks
which
savour
little
of
the
infinite
wisdom
even
in
its
normal
condition
if
i
can
determine
what
that
is
my
mind
is
obviously
the
slave
of
trivial
accidents
i
eat
something
that
disagrees
with
me
and
of
a
sudden
the
whole
aspect
of
life
is
changed
this
impulse
has
lost
its
force
and
another
which
before
i
should
not
for
a
moment
have
entertained
is
over
me
in
short
i
know
just
as
little
about
myself
as
i
do
about
the
eternal
essence
and
i
have
a
haunting
suspicion
that
i
may
be
a
mere
automaton
my
every
thought
and
act
due
to
some
power
which
uses
and
deceives
me
why
am
i
meditating
thus
instead
of
enjoying
the
life
of
the
natural
man
at
peace
with
himself
and
the
world
as
i
was
a
day
or
two
ago
merely
it
is
evident
because
my
health
has
suffered
a
temporary
disorder
it
has
passed
i
have
thought
enough
about
the
unthinkable
i
feel
my
quiet
returning
is
it
any
merit
of
mine
that
i
begin
to
be
in
health
once
more
could
i
by
any
effort
of
the
will
have
shunned
this
pitfall
xv
blackberries
hanging
thick
upon
the
hedge
bring
to
my
memory
something
of
long
ago
i
had
somehow
escaped
into
the
country
and
on
a
long
walk
began
to
feel
hunger
the
wayside
brambles
were
fruiting
i
picked
and
ate
and
ate
on
until
i
had
come
within
sight
of
an
inn
where
i
might
have
made
a
meal
but
my
hunger
was
satisfied
i
had
no
need
of
anything
more
and
as
i
thought
of
it
a
strange
feeling
of
surprise
a
sort
of
bewilderment
came
upon
me
what
could
it
be
that
i
had
eaten
and
eaten
sufficiently
it
struck
me
as
an
extraordinary
thing
at
that
time
my
ceaseless
preoccupation
was
how
to
obtain
money
to
keep
myself
alive
many
a
day
i
had
suffered
hunger
because
i
durst
not
spend
the
few
coins
i
possessed
the
food
i
could
buy
was
in
any
case
unsatisfactory
unvaried
but
here
nature
had
given
me
a
feast
which
seemed
delicious
and
i
had
eaten
all
i
wanted
the
wonder
held
me
for
a
long
time
and
to
this
day
i
can
recall
it
understand
it
i
think
there
could
be
no
better
illustration
of
what
it
means
to
be
very
poor
in
a
great
town
and
i
am
glad
to
have
been
through
it
to
those
days
of
misery
i
owe
much
of
the
contentment
which
i
now
enjoy
not
by
mere
force
of
contrast
but
because
i
have
been
better
taught
than
most
men
the
facts
which
condition
our
day
to
day
existence
to
the
ordinary
educated
person
freedom
from
anxiety
as
to
how
he
shall
merely
be
fed
and
clothed
is
a
matter
of
course
questioned
he
would
admit
it
to
be
an
agreeable
state
of
things
but
it
is
no
more
a
source
of
conscious
joy
to
him
than
physical
health
to
the
thoroughly
sound
man
for
me
were
i
to
live
another
fifty
years
this
security
would
be
a
delightful
surprise
renewed
with
every
renewal
of
day
i
know
as
only
one
with
my
experience
can
all
that
is
involved
in
the
possession
of
means
to
live
the
average
educated
man
has
never
stood
alone
utterly
alone
just
clad
and
nothing
more
than
that
with
the
problem
before
him
of
wresting
his
next
meal
from
a
world
that
cares
not
whether
he
live
or
die
there
is
no
such
school
of
political
economy
go
through
that
course
of
lectures
and
you
will
never
again
become
confused
as
to
the
meaning
of
elementary
terms
in
that
sorry
science
i
understand
far
better
than
most
men
what
i
owe
to
the
labour
of
others
this
money
which
i
draw
at
the
four
quarters
of
the
year
in
a
sense
falls
to
me
from
heaven
but
i
know
very
well
that
every
drachm
is
sweated
from
human
pores
not
thank
goodness
with
the
declared
tyranny
of
basest
capitalism
i
mean
only
that
it
is
the
product
of
human
labour
perhaps
wholesome
but
none
the
less
compulsory
look
far
enough
and
it
means
muscular
toil
that
swinking
of
the
ruder
man
which
supports
all
the
complex
structure
of
our
life
when
i
think
of
him
thus
the
man
of
the
people
earns
my
gratitude
that
it
is
gratitude
from
afar
that
i
never
was
and
never
shall
be
capable
of
democratic
fervour
is
a
characteristic
of
my
mind
which
i
long
ago
accepted
as
final
i
have
known
revolt
against
the
privilege
of
wealth
can
i
not
remember
spots
in
london
where
i
have
stood
savage
with
misery
looking
at
the
prosperous
folk
who
passed
but
i
could
never
feel
myself
at
one
with
the
native
poor
among
whom
i
dwelt
and
for
the
simplest
reason
i
came
to
know
them
too
well
he
who
cultivates
his
enthusiasm
amid
graces
and
comforts
may
nourish
an
illusion
with
regard
to
the
world
below
him
all
his
life
long
and
i
do
not
deny
that
he
may
be
the
better
for
it
for
me
no
illusion
was
possible
i
knew
the
poor
and
i
knew
that
their
aims
were
not
mine
i
knew
that
the
kind
of
life
such
a
modest
life
which
i
should
have
accepted
as
little
short
of
the
ideal
would
have
been
to
them
if
they
could
have
been
made
to
understand
it
a
weariness
and
a
contempt
to
ally
myself
with
them
against
the
upper
world
would
have
been
mere
dishonesty
or
sheer
despair
what
they
at
heart
desired
was
to
me
barren
what
i
coveted
was
to
them
for
ever
incomprehensible
that
my
own
aim
indicated
an
ideal
which
is
the
best
for
all
to
pursue
i
am
far
from
maintaining
it
may
be
so
or
not
i
have
long
known
the
idleness
of
advocating
reform
on
a
basis
of
personal
predilection
enough
to
set
my
own
thoughts
in
order
without
seeking
to
devise
a
new
economy
for
the
world
but
it
is
much
to
see
clearly
from
one
point
of
view
and
therein
the
evil
days
i
have
treasured
are
of
no
little
help
to
me
if
my
knowledge
be
only
subjective
why
it
only
concerns
myself
i
preach
to
no
one
upon
another
man
of
origin
and
education
like
to
mine
a
like
experience
of
hardship
might
have
a
totally
different
effect
he
might
identify
himself
with
the
poor
burn
to
the
end
of
his
life
with
the
noblest
humanitarianism
i
should
no
further
criticize
him
than
to
say
that
he
saw
with
other
eyes
than
mine
a
vision
perhaps
larger
and
more
just
but
in
one
respect
he
resembles
me
if
ever
such
a
man
arises
let
him
be
questioned
it
will
be
found
that
he
once
made
a
meal
of
blackberries
and
mused
upon
it
xvi
i
stood
watching
harvesters
at
work
and
a
foolish
envy
took
hold
upon
me
to
be
one
of
those
brawny
men
who
can
string
their
muscles
from
dawn
to
sundown
and
go
home
without
an
ache
to
the
sound
slumber
which
will
make
them
fresh
again
for
toil
i
am
a
man
in
the
middle
years
with
limbs
shaped
as
those
of
another
and
subject
to
no
prostrating
malady
yet
i
doubt
whether
i
could
endure
the
lightest
part
of
this
field
labour
even
for
half
an
hour
is
that
indeed
to
be
a
man
could
i
feel
surprised
if
one
of
these
stalwart
fellows
turned
upon
me
a
look
of
contempt
yet
he
would
never
dream
that
i
envied
him
he
would
think
it
as
probable
no
doubt
that
i
should
compare
myself
unfavourably
with
one
of
the
farm
horses
there
comes
the
old
idle
dream
balance
of
mind
and
body
perfect
physical
health
combined
with
the
fulness
of
intellectual
vigour
why
should
i
not
be
there
in
the
harvest
field
if
so
it
pleased
me
yet
none
the
less
live
for
thought
many
a
theorist
holds
the
thing
possible
and
looks
to
its
coming
in
a
better
time
if
so
two
changes
must
needs
come
before
it
there
will
no
longer
exist
a
profession
of
literature
and
all
but
the
whole
of
every
library
will
be
destroyed
leaving
only
the
few
books
which
are
universally
recognized
as
national
treasures
thus
and
thus
only
can
mental
and
physical
equilibrium
ever
be
brought
about
it
is
idle
to
talk
to
us
of
the
greeks
the
people
we
mean
when
so
naming
them
were
a
few
little
communities
living
under
very
peculiar
conditions
and
endowed
by
nature
with
most
exceptional
characteristics
the
sporadic
civilization
which
we
are
too
much
in
the
habit
of
regarding
as
if
it
had
been
no
less
stable
than
brilliant
was
a
succession
of
the
briefest
splendours
gleaming
here
and
there
from
the
coasts
of
the
aegean
to
those
of
the
western
mediterranean
our
heritage
of
greek
literature
and
art
is
priceless
the
example
of
greek
life
possesses
for
us
not
the
slightest
value
the
greeks
had
nothing
alien
to
study
not
even
a
foreign
or
a
dead
language
they
read
hardly
at
all
preferring
to
listen
they
were
a
people
much
given
to
social
amusement
and
hardly
knowing
what
we
call
industry
their
ignorance
was
vast
their
wisdom
a
grace
of
the
gods
together
with
their
fair
intelligence
they
had
grave
moral
weaknesses
if
we
could
see
and
speak
with
an
average
athenian
of
the
periclean
age
he
would
cause
no
little
disappointment
there
would
be
so
much
more
of
the
barbarian
in
him
and
at
the
same
time
of
the
decadent
than
we
had
anticipated
more
than
possibly
even
his
physique
would
be
a
disillusion
leave
him
in
that
old
world
which
is
precious
to
the
imagination
of
a
few
but
to
the
business
and
bosoms
of
the
modern
multitude
irrelevant
as
memphis
or
babylon
the
man
of
thought
as
we
understand
him
is
all
but
necessarily
the
man
of
impaired
health
the
rare
exception
will
be
found
to
come
of
a
stock
which
may
indeed
have
been
distinguished
by
intelligence
but
represented
in
all
its
members
the
active
rather
than
the
studious
or
contemplative
life
whilst
the
children
of
such
fortunate
thinkers
are
sure
either
to
revert
to
the
active
type
or
to
exhibit
the
familiar
sacrifice
of
body
to
mind
i
am
not
denying
the
possibility
of
sana
in
corpore
that
is
another
thing
nor
do
i
speak
of
the
healthy
people
happily
still
numerous
who
are
at
the
same
time
witted
and
fond
of
books
the
man
i
have
in
view
is
he
who
pursues
the
things
of
the
mind
with
passion
who
turns
impatiently
from
all
common
interests
or
cares
which
encroach
upon
his
sacred
time
who
is
haunted
by
a
sense
of
the
infinity
of
thought
and
learning
who
sadly
aware
of
the
conditions
on
which
he
holds
his
mental
vitality
can
not
resist
the
hourly
temptation
to
ignore
them
add
to
these
native
characteristics
the
frequent
fact
that
such
a
man
must
make
merchandise
of
his
attainments
must
toil
under
the
perpetual
menace
of
destitution
and
what
hope
remains
that
his
blood
will
keep
the
true
rhythm
that
his
nerves
will
play
as
nature
bade
them
that
his
sinews
will
bide
the
strain
of
exceptional
task
such
a
man
may
gaze
with
envy
at
those
who
sweat
in
the
eye
of
phoebus
but
he
knows
that
no
choice
was
offered
him
and
if
life
has
so
far
been
benignant
as
to
grant
him
frequent
tranquillity
of
studious
hours
let
him
look
from
the
reapers
to
the
golden
harvest
and
fare
on
in
thankfulness
xvii
that
a
labourer
in
the
fields
should
stand
very
much
on
the
level
of
the
beast
that
toils
with
him
can
be
neither
desirable
nor
necessary
he
does
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
one
hears
that
only
the
peasant
will
nowadays
consent
to
the
peasant
life
his
children
taught
to
read
the
newspaper
make
what
haste
they
can
to
the
land
of
promise
where
newspapers
are
printed
that
here
is
something
altogether
wrong
it
needs
no
evangelist
to
tell
us
the
remedy
no
prophet
has
as
yet
even
indicated
husbandry
has
in
our
time
been
glorified
in
eloquence
which
for
the
most
part
is
vain
endeavouring
as
it
does
to
prove
a
falsity
that
the
agricultural
life
is
in
itself
favourable
to
gentle
emotions
to
sweet
thoughtfulness
and
to
all
the
human
virtues
agriculture
is
one
of
the
most
exhausting
forms
of
toil
and
in
itself
by
no
means
conducive
to
spiritual
development
that
it
played
a
civilizing
part
in
the
history
of
the
world
is
merely
due
to
the
fact
that
by
creating
wealth
it
freed
a
portion
of
mankind
from
the
labour
of
the
plough
enthusiasts
have
tried
the
experiment
of
turning
husbandman
one
of
them
writes
of
his
experience
in
notable
phrase
oh
labour
is
the
curse
of
the
world
and
nobody
can
meddle
with
it
without
becoming
proportionately
brutified
is
it
a
praiseworthy
matter
that
i
have
spent
five
golden
months
in
providing
food
for
cows
and
horses
it
is
not
so
thus
nathaniel
hawthorne
at
brook
farm
in
the
bitterness
of
his
disillusion
he
went
too
far
labour
may
be
and
very
often
is
an
accursed
and
a
brutalizing
thing
but
assuredly
it
is
not
the
curse
of
the
world
nay
it
is
the
world
supreme
blessing
hawthorne
had
committed
a
folly
and
he
paid
for
it
in
loss
of
mental
balance
for
him
plainly
it
was
no
suitable
task
to
feed
cows
and
horses
yet
many
a
man
would
perceive
the
nobler
side
of
such
occupation
for
it
signifies
of
course
providing
food
for
mankind
the
interest
of
this
quotation
lies
in
the
fact
that
all
unconsciously
so
intelligent
a
man
as
hawthorne
had
been
reduced
to
the
mental
state
of
our
agricultural
labourers
in
revolt
against
the
country
life
not
only
is
his
intellect
in
abeyance
but
his
emotions
have
ceased
to
be
a
true
guide
the
worst
feature
of
the
rustic
mind
in
our
day
is
not
its
ignorance
or
grossness
but
its
rebellious
discontent
like
all
other
evils
this
is
seen
to
be
an
inevitable
outcome
of
the
condition
of
things
one
understands
it
only
too
well
the
bucolic
wants
to
better
himself
he
is
sick
of
feeding
cows
and
horses
he
imagines
that
on
the
pavement
of
london
he
would
walk
with
a
manlier
tread
there
is
no
help
in
visions
of
arcadia
yet
it
is
plain
fact
that
in
days
gone
by
the
peasantry
found
life
more
than
endurable
and
yet
were
more
intelligent
than
our
who
still
hold
by
the
plough
they
had
their
now
utterly
forgotten
they
had
romances
and
fairy
lore
which
their
descendants
could
no
more
appreciate
than
an
idyll
of
theocritus
ah
but
let
it
be
remembered
that
they
had
also
a
and
this
is
the
illumining
word
if
your
peasant
love
the
fields
which
give
him
bread
he
will
not
think
it
hard
to
labour
in
them
his
toil
will
no
longer
be
as
that
of
the
beast
but
and
touched
with
a
light
from
other
than
the
visible
heavens
no
use
to
blink
the
hard
and
dull
features
of
rustic
existence
let
them
rather
be
insisted
upon
that
those
who
own
and
derive
profit
from
the
land
may
be
constant
in
human
care
for
the
lives
which
make
it
fruitful
such
care
may
perchance
avail
in
some
degree
to
counteract
the
restless
tendency
of
the
time
the
dweller
in
a
pleasant
cottage
is
not
so
likely
to
wish
to
wander
from
it
as
he
who
shelters
himself
in
a
hovel
folk
talk
about
reawakening
love
of
the
country
by
means
of
deliberate
instruction
lies
any
hope
that
way
does
it
seem
to
promise
a
return
of
the
time
when
the
old
english
names
of
all
our
flowers
were
common
on
rustic
lips
by
which
indeed
they
were
first
uttered
the
fact
that
flowers
and
birds
are
forgotten
together
with
the
songs
and
the
elves
shows
how
advanced
is
the
process
of
rural
degeneration
most
likely
it
is
foolishness
to
hope
for
the
revival
of
any
bygone
social
virtue
the
husbandman
of
the
future
will
be
i
daresay
a
mechanic
of
the
species
as
he
goes
about
his
work
he
will
sing
the
last
refrain
of
the
and
his
holidays
will
be
spent
in
the
nearest
great
town
for
him
i
fancy
there
will
be
little
attraction
in
ever
such
melodious
talk
about
common
objects
of
the
country
flowers
perhaps
at
all
events
those
of
tilth
and
pasture
will
have
been
all
but
improved
away
and
as
likely
as
not
the
word
home
will
have
only
a
special
significance
indicating
the
common
abode
of
retired
labourers
who
are
drawing
pensions
xviii
i
can
not
close
my
eyes
upon
this
day
without
setting
down
some
record
of
it
yet
the
foolish
insufficiency
of
words
at
sunrise
i
looked
forth
nowhere
could
i
discern
a
cloud
the
size
of
a
man
hand
the
leaves
quivered
gently
as
if
with
joy
in
the
divine
morning
which
glistened
upon
their
dew
at
sunset
i
stood
in
the
meadow
above
my
house
and
watched
the
red
orb
sink
into
purple
mist
whilst
in
the
violet
heaven
behind
me
rose
the
perfect
moon
all
between
through
the
soft
circling
of
the
dial
shadow
was
loveliness
and
quiet
unutterable
never
i
could
fancy
did
autumn
clothe
in
such
magnificence
the
elms
and
beeches
never
i
should
think
did
the
leafage
on
my
walls
blaze
in
such
royal
crimson
it
was
no
day
for
wandering
under
a
canopy
of
blue
or
gold
where
the
eye
could
fall
on
nothing
that
was
not
beautiful
enough
to
be
at
one
with
nature
in
dreamy
rest
from
stubble
fields
sounded
the
long
caw
of
rooks
a
sleepy
crowing
ever
and
anon
told
of
the
neighbour
farm
my
doves
cooed
above
their
cot
was
it
for
five
minutes
or
was
it
for
an
hour
that
i
watched
the
yellow
butterfly
wafted
as
by
an
insensible
tremor
of
the
air
amid
the
garden
glintings
in
every
autumn
there
comes
one
such
flawless
day
none
that
i
have
known
brought
me
a
mind
so
touched
to
the
fitting
mood
of
welcome
and
so
fulfilled
the
promise
of
its
peace
xix
i
was
at
ramble
in
the
lanes
when
from
somewhere
at
a
distance
there
sounded
the
voice
of
a
countryman
strange
to
say
singing
the
notes
were
indistinct
but
they
rose
to
my
ear
with
a
moment
musical
sadness
and
of
a
sudden
my
heart
was
stricken
with
a
memory
so
keen
that
i
knew
not
whether
it
was
pain
or
delight
for
the
sound
seemed
to
me
that
of
a
peasant
song
which
i
once
heard
whilst
sitting
among
the
ruins
of
paestum
the
english
landscape
faded
before
my
eyes
i
saw
great
doric
columns
of
travertine
between
them
as
i
looked
one
way
a
deep
strip
of
sea
when
i
turned
the
purple
gorges
of
the
apennine
and
all
about
the
temple
where
i
sat
in
solitude
a
wilderness
dead
and
still
but
for
that
long
note
of
wailing
melody
i
had
not
thought
it
possible
that
here
in
my
beloved
home
where
regret
and
desire
are
all
but
unknown
to
me
i
could
have
been
so
deeply
troubled
by
a
thought
of
things
far
off
i
returned
with
head
bent
that
voice
singing
in
my
memory
all
the
delight
i
have
known
in
italian
travel
burned
again
within
my
heart
the
old
spell
has
not
lost
its
power
never
i
know
will
it
again
draw
me
away
from
england
but
the
southern
sunlight
can
not
fade
from
my
imagination
and
to
dream
of
its
glow
upon
the
ruins
of
old
time
wakes
in
me
the
voiceless
desire
which
once
was
anguish
in
his
goethe
tells
that
at
one
moment
of
his
life
the
desire
for
italy
became
to
him
a
scarce
endurable
suffering
at
length
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
or
to
read
of
things
italian
even
the
sight
of
a
latin
book
so
tortured
him
that
he
turned
away
from
it
and
the
day
arrived
when
in
spite
of
every
obstacle
he
yielded
to
the
sickness
of
longing
and
in
secret
stole
away
southward
when
first
i
read
that
passage
it
represented
exactly
the
state
of
my
own
mind
to
think
of
italy
was
to
feel
myself
goaded
by
a
longing
which
at
times
made
me
literally
ill
i
too
had
put
aside
my
latin
books
simply
because
i
could
not
endure
the
torment
of
imagination
they
caused
me
and
i
had
so
little
hope
nay
for
years
no
shadow
of
reasonable
hope
that
i
should
ever
be
able
to
appease
my
desire
i
taught
myself
to
read
italian
that
was
something
i
worked
at
a
colloquial
but
my
sickness
only
grew
towards
despair
then
came
into
my
hands
a
sum
of
money
such
a
poor
little
sum
for
a
book
i
had
written
it
was
early
autumn
i
chanced
to
hear
some
one
speak
of
naples
and
only
death
would
have
held
me
back
xx
truly
i
grow
aged
i
have
no
longer
much
delight
in
wine
but
then
no
wine
ever
much
rejoiced
me
save
that
of
italy
in
england
is
after
all
only
a
mere
playing
with
an
exotic
inspiration
tennyson
had
his
port
whereto
clings
a
good
old
tradition
sherris
sack
belongs
to
a
nobler
age
these
drinks
are
not
for
us
let
him
who
will
toy
with
dubious
bordeaux
or
burgundy
to
get
good
of
them
soul
good
you
must
be
on
the
green
side
of
thirty
once
or
twice
they
have
plucked
me
from
despair
i
would
not
speak
unkindly
of
anything
in
cask
or
bottle
which
bears
the
great
name
of
wine
but
for
me
it
is
a
thing
of
days
gone
by
never
again
shall
i
know
the
mellow
hour
regnat
rosa
cum
madent
yet
how
it
lives
in
memory
what
call
you
this
wine
i
asked
of
the
at
paestum
when
he
ministered
to
my
thirst
di
he
answered
and
what
a
glow
in
the
name
there
i
drank
it
seated
against
the
column
of
poseidon
temple
there
i
drank
it
my
feet
resting
on
acanthus
my
eyes
wandering
from
sea
to
mountain
or
peering
at
little
shells
niched
in
the
crumbling
surface
of
the
sacred
stone
the
autumn
day
declined
a
breeze
of
evening
whispered
about
the
forsaken
shore
on
the
far
summit
lay
a
long
still
cloud
and
its
hue
was
that
of
my
calabrian
wine
how
many
such
moments
come
back
to
me
as
my
thoughts
wander
dim
little
in
city
byways
inns
smelling
of
the
sun
in
forgotten
valleys
on
the
mountain
side
or
by
the
tideless
shore
where
the
grape
has
given
me
of
its
blood
and
made
life
a
rapture
who
but
the
veriest
fanatic
of
teetotalism
would
grudge
me
those
hours
so
gloriously
redeemed
no
draught
of
wine
amid
the
old
tombs
under
the
violet
sky
but
made
me
for
the
time
a
better
man
larger
of
brain
more
courageous
more
gentle
was
a
revelry
whereon
came
no
repentance
could
i
but
live
for
ever
in
thoughts
and
feelings
such
as
those
born
to
me
in
the
shadow
of
the
italian
vine
there
i
listened
to
the
sacred
poets
there
i
walked
with
the
wise
of
old
there
did
the
gods
reveal
to
me
the
secret
of
their
eternal
calm
i
hear
the
red
rillet
as
it
flows
into
the
rustic
glass
i
see
the
purple
light
upon
the
hills
fill
to
me
again
thou
of
the
roman
visage
and
all
but
roman
speech
is
not
yonder
the
long
gleaming
of
the
appian
way
chant
in
the
old
measure
the
song
imperishable
dum
capitolium
scandet
cum
tacita
virgine
pontifex
aye
and
for
how
many
an
age
when
pontiff
and
vestal
sleep
in
the
eternal
silence
let
the
slave
of
the
iron
gods
chatter
what
he
will
for
him
flows
no
falernian
for
him
the
muses
have
no
smile
no
melody
ere
the
sun
set
and
the
darkness
fall
about
us
fill
again
xxi
is
there
at
this
moment
any
boy
of
twenty
fairly
educated
but
without
means
without
help
with
nothing
but
the
glow
in
his
brain
and
steadfast
courage
in
his
heart
who
sits
in
a
london
garret
and
writes
for
dear
life
there
must
be
i
suppose
yet
all
that
i
have
read
and
heard
of
late
years
about
young
writers
shows
them
in
a
very
different
aspect
no
garretteers
these
novelists
and
journalists
awaiting
their
promotion
they
eat
and
entertain
their
critics
at
fashionable
restaurants
they
are
seen
in
expensive
seats
at
the
theatre
they
inhabit
handsome
flats
photographed
for
an
illustrated
paper
on
the
first
excuse
at
the
worst
they
belong
to
a
reputable
club
and
have
garments
which
permit
them
to
attend
a
garden
party
or
an
evening
at
home
without
attracting
unpleasant
notice
many
biographical
sketches
have
i
read
during
the
last
decade
making
personal
introduction
of
young
mr
this
or
young
miss
that
whose
book
was
as
the
sweet
language
of
the
day
will
have
it
booming
but
never
one
in
which
there
was
a
hint
of
stern
struggle
of
the
pinched
stomach
and
frozen
fingers
i
surmise
that
the
path
of
literature
is
being
made
too
easy
doubtless
it
is
a
rare
thing
nowadays
for
a
lad
whose
education
ranks
him
with
the
upper
middle
class
to
find
himself
utterly
without
resources
should
he
wish
to
devote
himself
to
the
profession
of
letters
and
there
is
the
root
of
the
matter
writing
has
come
to
be
recognized
as
a
profession
almost
as
as
church
or
law
a
lad
may
go
into
it
with
full
parental
approval
with
ready
avuncular
support
i
heard
not
long
ago
of
an
eminent
lawyer
who
had
paid
a
couple
of
hundred
per
annum
for
his
instruction
in
the
art
of
fiction
yea
the
art
of
fiction
by
a
not
very
brilliant
professor
of
that
art
really
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
an
astonishing
fact
a
fact
vastly
significant
starvation
it
is
true
does
not
necessarily
produce
fine
literature
but
one
feels
uneasy
about
these
to
the
two
or
three
who
have
a
measure
of
conscience
and
vision
i
could
wish
as
the
best
thing
some
calamity
which
would
leave
them
friendless
in
the
streets
they
would
perish
perhaps
but
set
that
possibility
against
the
all
but
certainty
of
their
present
prospect
fatty
degeneration
of
the
soul
and
is
it
not
acceptable
i
thought
of
this
as
i
stood
yesterday
watching
a
noble
sunset
which
brought
back
to
my
memory
the
sunsets
of
a
london
autumn
thirty
years
ago
more
glorious
it
seems
to
me
than
any
i
have
since
beheld
it
happened
that
on
one
such
evening
i
was
by
the
river
at
chelsea
with
nothing
to
do
except
to
feel
that
i
was
hungry
and
to
reflect
that
before
morning
i
should
be
hungrier
still
i
loitered
upon
battersea
bridge
the
old
picturesque
wooden
bridge
and
there
the
western
sky
took
hold
upon
me
half
an
hour
later
i
was
speeding
home
i
sat
down
and
wrote
a
description
of
what
i
had
seen
and
straightway
sent
it
to
an
evening
newspaper
which
to
my
astonishment
published
the
thing
next
day
on
battersea
bridge
how
proud
i
was
of
that
little
bit
of
writing
i
should
not
much
like
to
see
it
again
for
i
thought
it
then
so
good
that
i
am
sure
it
would
give
me
an
unpleasant
sensation
now
still
i
wrote
it
because
i
enjoyed
doing
so
quite
as
much
as
because
i
was
hungry
and
the
couple
of
guineas
it
brought
me
had
as
pleasant
a
ring
as
any
money
i
ever
earned
xxii
i
wonder
whether
it
be
really
true
as
i
have
more
than
once
seen
suggested
that
the
publication
of
anthony
trollope
autobiography
in
some
degree
accounts
for
the
neglect
into
which
he
and
his
works
fell
so
soon
after
his
death
i
should
like
to
believe
it
for
such
a
fact
would
be
from
one
point
of
view
a
credit
to
the
great
big
stupid
public
only
of
course
from
one
point
of
view
the
notable
merits
of
work
are
unaffected
by
one
knowledge
of
how
that
work
was
produced
at
his
best
he
is
an
admirable
writer
of
the
pedestrian
school
and
this
disappearance
of
his
name
does
not
mean
final
oblivion
like
every
other
novelist
of
note
he
had
two
classes
of
admirers
those
who
read
him
for
the
sake
of
that
excellence
which
here
and
there
he
achieved
and
the
undistinguishing
crowd
which
found
in
him
a
level
entertainment
but
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
think
that
the
great
big
stupid
was
really
somewhere
in
its
secret
economy
offended
by
that
revelation
of
mechanical
methods
which
made
the
autobiography
either
a
disgusting
or
an
amusing
book
to
those
who
read
it
more
intelligently
a
man
with
a
watch
before
his
eyes
penning
exactly
so
many
words
every
quarter
of
an
hour
one
imagines
that
this
picture
might
haunt
disagreeably
the
thoughts
even
of
mudie
steadiest
subscriber
that
it
might
come
between
him
or
her
and
any
trollopean
work
that
lay
upon
the
counter
the
surprise
was
so
cynically
sprung
upon
a
yet
innocent
public
at
that
happy
time
already
it
seems
so
long
ago
the
literary
news
set
before
ordinary
readers
mostly
had
reference
to
literary
work
in
a
reputable
sense
of
the
term
and
not
as
now
to
the
processes
of
literary
manufacture
and
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
literary
market
trollope
himself
tells
how
he
surprised
the
editor
of
a
periodical
who
wanted
a
serial
from
him
by
asking
how
many
thousand
words
it
should
run
to
an
anecdote
savouring
indeed
of
good
old
days
since
then
readers
have
grown
accustomed
to
revelations
of
literary
method
and
nothing
in
that
kind
can
shock
them
there
has
come
into
existence
a
school
of
journalism
which
would
seem
to
have
deliberately
set
itself
the
task
of
degrading
authorship
and
everything
connected
with
it
and
these
pernicious
scribblers
or
typists
to
be
more
accurate
have
found
the
authors
of
a
fretful
age
only
too
receptive
of
their
mercantile
suggestions
yes
yes
i
know
as
well
as
any
man
that
reforms
were
needed
in
the
relations
between
author
and
publisher
who
knows
better
than
i
that
your
representative
author
face
to
face
with
your
representative
publisher
was
is
and
ever
will
be
at
a
ludicrous
disadvantage
and
there
is
no
reason
in
the
nature
and
the
decency
of
things
why
this
wrong
should
not
by
some
contrivance
be
remedied
a
big
blusterous
genial
brute
of
a
trollope
could
very
fairly
hold
his
own
and
exact
at
all
events
an
acceptable
share
in
the
profits
of
his
work
a
shrewd
and
vigorous
man
of
business
such
as
dickens
aided
by
a
lawyer
who
was
his
devoted
friend
could
do
even
better
and
in
reaping
sometimes
more
than
his
publisher
redress
the
ancient
injustice
but
pray
what
of
charlotte
bronte
think
of
that
grey
pinched
life
the
latter
years
of
which
would
have
been
so
brightened
had
charlotte
bronte
received
but
let
us
say
one
third
of
what
in
the
same
space
of
time
the
publisher
gained
by
her
books
i
know
all
about
this
alas
no
man
better
none
the
less
do
i
loathe
and
sicken
at
the
manifold
baseness
the
vulgarity
unutterable
which
as
a
result
of
the
new
order
is
blighting
our
literary
life
it
is
not
easy
to
see
how
in
such
an
atmosphere
great
and
noble
books
can
ever
again
come
into
being
may
it
perhaps
be
hoped
that
once
again
the
multitude
will
be
somehow
touched
with
disgust
that
the
market
for
literary
news
of
this
costermonger
sort
will
some
day
fail
dickens
why
there
too
was
a
disclosure
of
literary
methods
did
not
forster
make
known
to
all
and
sundry
exactly
how
dickens
work
was
done
and
how
the
bargains
for
its
production
were
made
the
multitudinous
public
saw
him
at
his
desk
learnt
how
long
he
sat
there
were
told
that
he
could
not
get
on
without
having
certain
little
ornaments
before
his
eyes
and
that
blue
ink
and
a
quill
pen
were
indispensable
to
his
writing
and
did
all
this
information
ever
chill
the
loyalty
of
a
single
reader
there
was
a
difference
in
truth
between
the
picture
of
charles
dickens
sitting
down
to
a
chapter
of
his
current
novel
and
that
of
the
trollope
doing
his
so
many
words
to
the
fifteen
minutes
trollope
we
know
wronged
himself
by
the
tone
and
manner
of
his
reminiscences
but
that
tone
and
manner
indicated
an
inferiority
of
mind
of
nature
dickens
though
he
died
in
the
endeavour
to
increase
not
for
himself
an
already
ample
fortune
disastrous
influence
of
his
time
and
class
wrought
with
an
artistic
ingenuousness
and
fervour
such
as
trollope
could
not
even
conceive
methodical
of
course
he
was
no
long
work
of
prose
fiction
was
ever
brought
into
existence
save
by
methodical
labour
but
we
know
that
there
was
no
measuring
of
so
many
words
to
the
hour
the
picture
of
him
at
work
which
is
seen
in
his
own
letters
is
one
of
the
most
bracing
and
inspiring
in
the
history
of
literature
it
has
had
and
will
always
have
a
great
part
in
maintaining
dickens
place
in
the
love
and
reverence
of
those
who
understand
xxiii
as
i
walked
in
the
golden
sunlight
this
warm
still
day
on
the
far
verge
of
autumn
there
suddenly
came
to
me
a
thought
which
checked
my
step
and
for
the
moment
half
bewildered
me
i
said
to
myself
my
life
is
over
surely
i
ought
to
have
been
aware
of
that
simple
fact
certainly
it
has
made
part
of
my
meditation
has
often
coloured
my
mood
but
the
thing
had
never
definitely
shaped
itself
ready
in
words
for
the
tongue
my
life
is
over
i
uttered
the
sentence
once
or
twice
that
my
ear
might
test
its
truth
truth
undeniable
however
strange
undeniable
as
the
figure
of
my
age
last
birthday
my
age
at
this
time
of
life
many
a
man
is
bracing
himself
for
new
efforts
is
calculating
on
a
decade
or
two
of
pursuit
and
attainment
i
too
may
perhaps
live
for
some
years
but
for
me
there
is
no
more
activity
no
ambition
i
have
had
my
chance
and
i
see
what
i
made
of
it
the
thought
was
for
an
instant
all
but
dreadful
what
i
who
only
yesterday
was
a
young
man
planning
hoping
looking
forward
to
life
as
to
a
practically
endless
career
i
who
was
so
vigorous
and
scornful
have
come
to
this
day
of
definite
retrospect
how
is
it
possible
but
i
have
done
nothing
i
have
had
no
time
i
have
only
been
preparing
myself
a
mere
apprentice
to
life
my
brain
is
at
some
prank
i
am
suffering
a
momentary
delusion
i
shall
shake
myself
and
return
to
common
sense
to
my
schemes
and
activities
and
eager
enjoyments
nevertheless
my
life
is
over
what
a
little
thing
i
knew
how
the
philosophers
had
spoken
i
repeated
their
musical
phrases
about
the
mortal
span
yet
never
till
now
believed
them
and
this
is
all
a
man
life
can
be
so
brief
and
so
vain
idly
would
i
persuade
myself
that
life
in
the
true
sense
is
only
now
beginning
that
the
time
of
sweat
and
fear
was
not
life
at
all
and
that
it
now
only
depends
upon
my
will
to
lead
a
worthy
existence
that
may
be
a
sort
of
consolation
but
it
does
not
obscure
the
truth
that
i
shall
never
again
see
possibilities
and
promises
opening
before
me
i
have
retired
and
for
me
as
truly
as
for
the
retired
tradesman
life
is
over
i
can
look
back
upon
its
completed
course
and
what
a
little
thing
i
am
tempted
to
laugh
i
hold
myself
within
the
limit
of
a
smile
and
that
is
best
to
smile
not
in
scorn
but
in
all
forbearance
without
too
much
after
all
that
dreadful
aspect
of
the
thing
never
really
took
hold
of
me
i
could
put
it
by
without
much
effort
life
is
done
and
what
matter
whether
it
has
been
in
sum
painful
or
enjoyable
even
now
i
can
not
say
a
fact
which
in
itself
should
prevent
me
from
taking
the
loss
too
seriously
what
does
it
matter
destiny
with
the
hidden
face
decreed
that
i
should
come
into
being
play
my
little
part
and
pass
again
into
silence
is
it
mine
either
to
approve
or
to
rebel
let
me
be
grateful
that
i
have
suffered
no
intolerable
wrong
no
terrible
woe
of
flesh
or
spirit
such
as
others
alas
alas
have
found
in
their
lot
is
it
not
much
to
have
accomplished
so
large
a
part
of
the
mortal
journey
with
so
much
ease
if
i
find
myself
astonished
at
its
brevity
and
small
significance
why
that
is
my
own
fault
the
voices
of
those
gone
before
had
sufficiently
warned
me
better
to
see
the
truth
now
and
accept
it
than
to
fall
into
dread
surprise
on
some
day
of
weakness
and
foolishly
to
cry
against
fate
i
will
be
glad
rather
than
sorry
and
think
of
the
thing
no
more
xxiv
waking
at
early
dawn
used
to
be
one
of
the
things
i
most
dreaded
the
night
which
made
me
capable
of
resuming
labour
had
brought
no
such
calm
as
should
follow
upon
repose
i
woke
to
a
vision
of
the
darkest
miseries
and
lay
through
the
hours
of
daybreak
too
often
in
very
anguish
but
that
is
past
sometimes
ere
yet
i
know
myself
the
mind
struggles
as
with
an
evil
spirit
on
the
confines
of
sleep
then
the
light
at
my
window
the
pictures
on
my
walls
restore
me
to
happy
consciousness
happier
for
the
miserable
dream
now
when
i
lie
thinking
my
worst
trouble
is
wonder
at
the
common
life
of
man
i
see
it
as
a
thing
so
incredible
that
it
oppresses
the
mind
like
a
haunting
illusion
is
it
the
truth
that
men
are
fretting
raving
killing
each
other
for
matters
so
trivial
that
i
even
i
so
far
from
saint
or
philosopher
must
needs
fall
into
amazement
when
i
consider
them
i
could
imagine
a
man
who
by
living
alone
and
at
peace
came
to
regard
the
everyday
world
as
not
really
existent
but
a
creation
of
his
own
fancy
in
unsound
moments
what
lunatic
ever
dreamt
of
things
less
consonant
with
the
calm
reason
than
those
which
are
thought
and
done
every
minute
in
every
community
of
men
called
sane
but
i
put
aside
this
reflection
as
soon
as
may
be
it
perturbs
me
fruitlessly
then
i
listen
to
the
sounds
about
my
cottage
always
soft
soothing
such
as
lead
the
mind
to
gentle
thoughts
sometimes
i
can
hear
nothing
not
the
rustle
of
a
leaf
not
the
buzz
of
a
fly
and
then
i
think
that
utter
silence
is
best
of
all
this
morning
i
was
awakened
by
a
continuous
sound
which
presently
shaped
itself
to
my
ear
as
a
multitudinous
shrilling
of
bird
voices
i
knew
what
it
meant
for
the
last
few
days
i
have
seen
the
swallows
gathering
now
they
were
ranged
upon
my
roof
perhaps
in
the
last
council
before
their
setting
forth
upon
the
great
journey
i
know
better
than
to
talk
about
animal
instinct
and
to
wonder
in
a
pitying
way
at
its
resemblance
to
reason
i
know
that
these
birds
show
to
us
a
life
far
more
reasonable
and
infinitely
more
beautiful
than
that
of
the
masses
of
mankind
they
talk
with
each
other
and
in
their
talk
is
neither
malice
nor
folly
could
one
but
interpret
the
converse
in
which
they
make
their
plans
for
the
long
and
perilous
flight
and
then
compare
it
with
that
of
numberless
respectable
persons
who
even
now
are
projecting
their
winter
in
the
south
xxv
yesterday
i
passed
by
an
elm
avenue
leading
to
a
beautiful
old
house
the
road
between
the
trees
was
covered
in
all
its
length
and
breadth
with
fallen
leaves
a
carpet
of
pale
gold
further
on
i
came
to
a
plantation
mostly
of
larches
it
shone
in
the
richest
aureate
hue
with
here
and
there
a
splash
of
which
was
a
young
beech
in
its
moment
of
autumnal
glory
i
looked
at
an
alder
laden
with
brown
catkins
its
blunt
foliage
stained
with
innumerable
shades
of
lovely
colour
near
it
was
a
with
but
a
few
leaves
hanging
on
its
branches
and
those
a
deep
orange
the
limes
i
see
are
already
bare
the
wind
is
loud
and
rain
dashes
against
my
casement
i
shall
awake
to
a
sky
of
winter
winter
blasts
from
the
channel
with
raining
scud
and
spume
of
mist
breaking
upon
the
hills
have
kept
me
indoors
all
day
yet
not
for
a
moment
have
i
been
dull
or
idle
and
now
by
the
latter
end
of
a
fire
i
feel
such
enjoyment
of
my
ease
and
tranquillity
that
i
must
needs
word
it
before
going
up
to
bed
of
course
one
ought
to
be
able
to
breast
weather
such
as
this
of
and
to
find
one
pleasure
in
the
strife
with
it
for
the
man
sound
in
body
and
serene
of
mind
there
is
no
such
thing
as
bad
weather
every
sky
has
its
beauty
and
storms
which
whip
the
blood
do
but
make
it
pulse
more
vigorously
i
remember
the
time
when
i
would
have
set
out
with
gusto
for
a
tramp
along
the
and
roads
nowadays
i
should
perhaps
pay
for
the
experiment
with
my
life
all
the
more
do
i
prize
the
shelter
of
these
good
walls
the
honest
workmanship
which
makes
my
doors
and
windows
proof
against
the
assailing
blast
in
all
england
the
land
of
comfort
there
is
no
room
more
comfortable
than
this
in
which
i
sit
comfortable
in
the
good
old
sense
of
the
word
giving
solace
to
the
mind
no
less
than
ease
to
the
body
and
never
does
it
look
more
homely
more
a
refuge
and
a
sanctuary
than
on
winter
nights
in
my
first
winter
here
i
tried
fires
of
wood
having
had
my
hearth
arranged
for
the
purpose
but
that
was
a
mistake
one
can
not
burn
logs
successfully
in
a
small
room
either
the
fire
being
kept
moderate
needs
constant
attention
or
its
triumphant
blaze
makes
the
room
too
hot
a
fire
is
a
delightful
thing
a
companion
and
an
inspiration
if
my
room
were
kept
warm
by
some
wretched
modern
contrivance
of
or
heated
air
would
it
be
the
same
to
me
as
that
beautiful
core
of
glowing
fuel
which
if
i
sit
and
gaze
into
it
becomes
a
world
of
wonders
let
science
warm
the
inhabitants
of
flats
and
hotels
as
effectually
and
economically
as
it
may
if
the
choice
were
forced
upon
me
i
had
rather
sit
like
an
italian
wrapped
in
my
mantle
softly
stirring
with
a
key
the
surface
of
the
brasier
charcoal
they
tell
me
we
are
burning
all
our
coal
and
with
wicked
wastefulness
i
am
sorry
for
it
but
i
can
not
on
that
account
make
cheerless
perhaps
the
last
winter
of
my
life
there
may
be
waste
on
domestic
hearths
but
the
wickedness
is
elsewhere
too
blatant
to
call
for
indication
use
common
sense
by
all
means
in
the
construction
of
grates
that
more
than
half
the
heat
of
the
kindly
coal
should
be
blown
up
the
chimney
is
desired
by
no
one
but
hold
by
the
open
fire
as
you
hold
by
whatever
else
is
best
in
england
because
in
the
course
of
nature
it
will
be
some
day
a
thing
of
the
past
like
most
other
things
that
are
worth
living
for
is
that
a
reason
why
it
should
not
be
enjoyed
as
long
as
possible
human
beings
may
ere
long
take
their
nourishment
in
the
form
of
pills
the
prevision
of
that
happy
economy
causes
me
no
reproach
when
i
sit
down
to
a
joint
of
meat
see
how
friendly
together
are
the
fire
and
the
shaded
lamp
both
have
their
part
alike
in
the
illumining
and
warming
of
the
room
as
the
fire
purrs
and
softly
crackles
so
does
my
lamp
at
intervals
utter
a
little
gurgling
sound
when
the
oil
flows
to
the
wick
and
custom
has
made
this
a
pleasure
to
me
another
sound
blending
with
both
is
the
gentle
ticking
of
the
clock
i
could
not
endure
one
of
those
bustling
little
clocks
which
tick
like
a
fever
pulse
and
are
only
fit
for
a
office
mine
hums
very
slowly
as
though
it
savoured
the
minutes
no
less
than
i
do
and
when
it
strikes
the
little
voice
is
telling
me
without
sadness
that
another
hour
of
life
is
reckoned
another
of
the
priceless
hours
quae
nobis
pereunt
et
imputantur
after
extinguishing
the
lamp
and
when
i
have
reached
the
door
i
always
turn
to
look
back
my
room
is
so
cosily
alluring
in
the
light
of
the
last
gleeds
that
i
do
not
easily
move
away
the
warm
glow
is
reflected
on
shining
wood
on
my
chair
my
on
the
bookcases
and
from
the
gilt
title
of
some
stately
volume
it
illumes
this
picture
it
half
disperses
the
gloom
on
that
i
could
imagine
that
as
in
a
fairy
tale
the
books
do
but
await
my
departure
to
begin
talking
among
themselves
a
little
tongue
of
flame
shoots
up
from
a
dying
ember
shadows
shift
upon
the
ceiling
and
the
walls
with
a
sigh
of
utter
contentment
i
go
forth
and
shut
the
door
softly
ii
i
came
home
this
afternoon
just
at
twilight
and
feeling
tired
after
my
walk
a
little
cold
too
i
first
crouched
before
the
fire
then
let
myself
drop
lazily
upon
the
hearthrug
i
had
a
book
in
my
hand
and
began
to
read
it
by
the
firelight
rising
in
a
few
minutes
i
found
the
open
page
still
legible
by
the
pale
glimmer
of
day
this
sudden
change
of
illumination
had
an
odd
effect
upon
me
it
was
so
unexpected
for
i
had
forgotten
that
dark
had
not
yet
fallen
and
i
saw
in
the
queer
little
experience
an
intellectual
symbol
the
book
was
verse
might
not
the
warm
rays
from
the
fire
exhibit
the
page
as
it
appears
to
an
imaginative
and
kindred
mind
whilst
that
cold
dull
light
from
the
window
showed
it
as
it
is
beheld
by
eyes
to
which
poetry
has
but
a
poor
literal
meaning
or
none
at
all
iii
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
enough
to
be
able
to
spend
a
little
money
without
fear
when
the
desire
for
some
indulgence
is
strong
upon
one
but
how
much
pleasanter
the
ability
to
give
money
away
greatly
as
i
relish
the
comforts
of
my
wonderful
new
life
no
joy
it
has
brought
me
equals
that
of
coming
in
aid
to
another
necessity
the
man
for
ever
pinched
in
circumstances
can
live
only
for
himself
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
about
doing
moral
good
in
practice
there
is
little
scope
or
hope
for
anything
of
that
kind
in
a
state
of
material
hardship
i
have
sent
s
a
cheque
for
fifty
pounds
it
will
come
as
a
very
boon
of
heaven
and
assuredly
blesseth
him
that
gives
as
much
as
him
that
takes
a
poor
fifty
pounds
which
the
wealthy
fool
throws
away
upon
some
idle
or
base
fantasy
and
never
thinks
of
it
yet
to
s
it
will
mean
life
and
light
and
i
to
whom
this
power
of
benefaction
is
such
a
new
thing
sign
the
cheque
with
a
hand
trembling
so
glad
and
proud
i
am
in
the
days
gone
by
i
have
sometimes
given
money
but
with
trembling
of
another
kind
it
was
as
likely
as
not
that
i
myself
some
black
foggy
morning
might
have
to
go
begging
for
my
own
dire
needs
that
is
one
of
the
bitter
curses
of
poverty
it
leaves
no
right
to
be
generous
of
my
abundance
abundance
to
me
though
starveling
pittance
in
the
view
of
everyday
prosperity
i
can
give
with
happiest
freedom
i
feel
myself
a
man
and
no
crouching
slave
with
his
back
ever
ready
for
the
lash
of
circumstance
there
are
those
i
know
who
thank
the
gods
amiss
and
most
easily
does
this
happen
in
the
matter
of
wealth
but
oh
how
good
it
is
to
desire
little
and
to
have
a
little
more
than
enough
iv
after
two
or
three
days
of
unseasonable
and
depressing
warmth
with
lowering
but
not
rainy
sky
i
woke
this
morning
to
find
the
land
covered
with
a
dense
mist
there
was
no
daybreak
and
till
long
after
the
due
hour
no
light
save
a
pale
sad
glimmer
at
the
window
now
at
i
begin
dimly
to
descry
gaunt
shapes
of
trees
whilst
a
haunting
drip
drip
on
the
garden
soil
tells
me
that
the
vapour
has
begun
to
condense
and
will
pass
in
rain
but
for
my
fire
i
should
be
in
indifferent
spirits
on
such
a
day
as
this
the
flame
sings
and
leaps
and
its
red
beauty
is
reflected
in
the
i
can
not
give
my
thoughts
to
reading
if
i
sat
unoccupied
they
would
brood
with
melancholy
fixedness
on
i
know
not
what
better
to
betake
myself
to
the
old
mechanic
exercise
of
the
pen
which
cheats
my
sense
of
time
wasted
i
think
of
fogs
in
london
fogs
of
murky
yellow
or
of
sheer
black
such
as
have
often
made
all
work
impossible
to
me
and
held
me
a
sort
of
dyspeptic
owl
in
moping
and
blinking
idleness
on
such
a
day
i
remember
i
once
found
myself
at
an
end
both
of
coal
and
of
with
no
money
to
purchase
either
all
i
could
do
was
to
go
to
bed
meaning
to
lie
there
till
the
sky
once
more
became
visible
but
a
second
day
found
the
fog
dense
as
ever
i
rose
in
darkness
i
stood
at
the
window
of
my
garret
and
saw
that
the
street
was
illumined
as
at
night
lamps
and
perfectly
visible
with
folk
going
about
their
business
the
fog
in
fact
had
risen
but
still
hung
above
the
tops
impermeable
by
any
heavenly
beam
my
solitude
being
no
longer
endurable
i
went
out
and
walked
the
town
for
hours
when
i
returned
it
was
with
a
few
coins
which
permitted
me
to
buy
warmth
and
light
i
had
sold
to
a
bookseller
a
volume
which
i
prized
and
was
so
much
the
poorer
for
the
money
in
my
pocket
years
after
that
i
recall
another
black
morning
as
usual
at
such
times
i
was
suffering
from
a
bad
cold
after
a
sleepless
night
i
fell
into
a
torpor
which
held
me
unconscious
for
an
hour
or
two
hideous
cries
aroused
me
sitting
up
in
the
dark
i
heard
men
going
along
the
street
roaring
news
of
a
hanging
that
had
just
taken
place
execution
of
i
forget
the
name
of
the
murderess
scene
on
the
scaffold
it
was
a
little
after
nine
the
enterprising
paper
had
promptly
got
out
its
gibbet
edition
a
morning
of
midwinter
roofs
and
ways
covered
with
snow
under
the
ghastly
and
whilst
i
lay
there
in
my
bed
that
woman
had
been
led
out
and
hanged
hanged
i
thought
with
horror
of
the
possibility
that
i
might
sicken
and
die
in
that
wilderness
of
houses
nothing
above
me
but
a
foul
and
pestilent
congregation
of
vapours
overcome
with
dread
i
rose
and
bestirred
myself
blinds
drawn
lamp
lit
and
by
a
blazing
fire
i
tried
to
make
believe
that
it
was
kindly
night
walking
along
the
road
after
nightfall
i
thought
all
at
once
of
london
streets
and
by
a
freak
of
mind
wished
i
were
there
i
saw
the
shining
of
the
yellow
glistening
of
a
wet
pavement
the
hurrying
people
the
cabs
the
omnibuses
and
i
wished
i
were
amid
it
all
what
did
it
mean
but
that
i
wished
i
were
young
again
not
seldom
i
have
a
sudden
vision
of
a
london
street
perhaps
the
dreariest
and
ugliest
which
for
a
moment
gives
me
a
feeling
of
often
it
is
the
high
street
of
islington
which
i
have
not
seen
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
at
least
no
thoroughfare
in
all
london
less
attractive
to
the
imagination
one
would
say
but
i
see
myself
walking
there
walking
with
the
quick
light
step
of
youth
and
there
of
course
is
the
charm
i
see
myself
after
a
long
day
of
work
and
loneliness
setting
forth
from
my
lodging
for
the
weather
i
care
nothing
rain
wind
fog
what
does
it
matter
the
fresh
air
fills
my
lungs
my
blood
circles
rapidly
i
feel
my
muscles
and
have
a
pleasure
in
the
hardness
of
the
stone
i
tread
upon
perhaps
i
have
money
in
my
pocket
i
am
going
to
the
theatre
and
afterwards
i
shall
treat
myself
to
supper
sausage
and
mashed
potatoes
with
a
pint
of
foaming
ale
the
gusto
with
which
i
look
forward
to
each
and
every
enjoyment
at
the
i
shall
roll
and
hustle
amid
the
throng
and
find
it
amusing
nothing
tires
me
late
at
night
i
shall
walk
all
the
way
back
to
islington
most
likely
singing
as
i
go
not
because
i
am
happy
nay
i
am
anything
but
that
but
my
age
is
something
and
twenty
i
am
strong
and
well
put
me
in
a
london
street
this
chill
damp
night
and
i
should
be
lost
in
barren
discomfort
but
in
those
old
days
if
i
am
not
mistaken
i
rather
preferred
the
seasons
of
bad
weather
i
had
in
fact
the
true
instinct
of
townsfolk
which
finds
pleasure
in
the
triumph
of
artificial
circumstance
over
natural
conditions
delighting
in
a
glare
and
tumult
of
busy
life
under
hostile
heavens
which
elsewhere
would
mean
shivering
the
theatre
at
such
a
time
is
doubly
warm
and
bright
every
shop
is
a
happy
harbour
of
refuge
there
behind
the
counter
stand
persons
quite
at
their
ease
ready
to
chat
as
they
serve
you
the
supper
bars
make
tempting
display
under
their
many
the
public
houses
are
full
of
people
who
all
have
money
to
spend
then
clangs
out
the
and
what
could
be
cheerier
i
have
much
ado
to
believe
that
i
really
felt
so
but
then
if
life
had
not
somehow
made
itself
tolerable
to
me
how
should
i
have
lived
through
those
many
years
human
creatures
have
a
marvellous
power
of
adapting
themselves
to
necessity
were
i
even
now
thrown
back
into
squalid
london
with
no
choice
but
to
abide
and
work
there
should
i
not
abide
and
work
notwithstanding
thoughts
of
the
chemist
shop
i
suppose
i
should
vi
one
of
the
shining
moments
of
my
day
is
that
when
having
returned
a
little
weary
from
an
afternoon
walk
i
exchange
boots
for
slippers
coat
for
easy
familiar
shabby
jacket
and
in
my
deep
elbowed
chair
await
the
perhaps
it
is
while
drinking
tea
that
i
most
of
all
enjoy
the
sense
of
leisure
in
days
gone
by
i
could
but
gulp
down
the
refreshment
hurried
often
harassed
by
the
thought
of
the
work
i
had
before
me
often
i
was
quite
insensible
of
the
aroma
the
flavour
of
what
i
drank
now
how
delicious
is
the
soft
yet
penetrating
odour
which
floats
into
my
study
with
the
appearance
of
the
teapot
what
solace
in
the
first
cup
what
deliberate
sipping
of
that
which
follows
what
a
glow
does
it
bring
after
a
walk
in
chilly
rain
the
while
i
look
around
at
my
books
and
pictures
tasting
the
happiness
of
their
tranquil
possession
i
cast
an
eye
towards
my
pipe
perhaps
i
prepare
it
with
seeming
thoughtfulness
for
the
reception
of
tobacco
and
never
surely
is
tobacco
more
soothing
more
suggestive
of
humane
thoughts
than
when
it
comes
just
after
tea
itself
a
bland
inspirer
in
nothing
is
the
english
genius
for
domesticity
more
notably
declared
than
in
the
institution
of
this
festival
almost
one
may
call
it
so
of
afternoon
tea
beneath
simple
roofs
the
hour
of
tea
has
something
in
it
of
sacred
for
it
marks
the
end
of
domestic
work
and
worry
the
beginning
of
restful
sociable
evening
the
mere
chink
of
cups
and
saucers
tunes
the
mind
to
happy
repose
i
care
nothing
for
your
five
tea
of
modish
idle
and
wearisome
like
all
else
in
which
that
world
has
part
i
speak
of
tea
where
one
is
at
home
in
quite
another
than
the
worldly
sense
to
admit
mere
strangers
to
your
is
profanation
on
the
other
hand
english
hospitality
has
here
its
kindliest
aspect
never
is
friend
more
welcome
than
when
he
drops
in
for
a
cup
of
tea
where
tea
is
really
a
meal
with
nothing
between
it
and
nine
supper
it
is
again
in
the
true
sense
the
meal
of
the
day
is
it
believable
that
the
chinese
in
who
knows
how
many
centuries
have
derived
from
tea
a
millionth
part
of
the
pleasure
or
the
good
which
it
has
brought
to
england
in
the
past
one
hundred
years
i
like
to
look
at
my
housekeeper
when
she
carries
in
the
tray
her
mien
is
festal
yet
in
her
smile
there
is
a
certain
gravity
as
though
she
performed
an
office
which
honoured
her
she
has
dressed
for
the
evening
that
is
to
say
her
clean
and
seemly
attire
of
working
hours
is
exchanged
for
garments
suitable
to
fireside
leisure
her
cheeks
are
warm
for
she
has
been
making
fragrant
toast
quickly
her
eye
glances
about
my
room
but
only
to
have
the
pleasure
of
noting
that
all
is
in
order
inconceivable
that
anything
serious
should
need
doing
at
this
hour
of
the
day
she
brings
the
little
table
within
the
glow
of
the
hearth
so
that
i
can
help
myself
without
changing
my
easy
position
if
she
speaks
it
will
only
be
a
pleasant
word
or
two
should
she
have
anything
important
to
say
the
moment
will
be
tea
not
before
it
this
she
knows
by
instinct
perchance
she
may
just
stoop
to
sweep
back
a
cinder
which
has
fallen
since
in
my
absence
she
looked
after
the
fire
it
is
done
quickly
and
silently
then
still
smiling
she
withdraws
and
i
know
that
she
is
going
to
enjoy
her
own
tea
her
own
toast
in
the
warm
comfortable
kitchen
vii
one
has
heard
much
condemnation
of
the
english
kitchen
our
typical
cook
is
spoken
of
as
a
gross
unimaginative
creature
capable
only
of
roasting
or
seething
our
table
is
said
to
be
such
as
would
weary
or
revolt
any
but
carnivores
we
are
told
that
our
bread
is
the
worst
in
europe
an
indigestible
paste
that
our
vegetables
are
diet
rather
for
the
hungry
animal
than
for
discriminative
man
that
our
warm
beverages
called
coffee
and
tea
are
so
carelessly
or
ignorantly
brewed
that
they
preserve
no
simple
virtue
of
the
drink
as
it
is
known
in
other
lands
to
be
sure
there
is
no
lack
of
evidence
to
explain
such
censure
the
class
which
provides
our
servants
is
undeniably
coarse
and
stupid
and
its
handiwork
of
every
kind
too
often
bears
the
native
stamp
for
all
that
english
victuals
are
in
quality
the
best
in
the
world
and
english
cookery
is
the
wholesomest
and
the
most
appetizing
known
to
any
temperate
clime
as
in
so
many
other
of
our
good
points
we
have
achieved
this
thing
unconsciously
your
ordinary
englishwoman
engaged
in
cooking
probably
has
no
other
thought
than
to
make
the
food
masticable
but
reflect
on
the
results
when
the
thing
is
well
done
and
there
appears
a
culinary
principle
nothing
could
be
simpler
yet
nothing
more
right
and
reasonable
the
aim
of
english
cooking
is
so
to
deal
with
the
raw
material
of
man
nourishment
as
to
bring
out
for
the
healthy
palate
all
its
natural
juices
and
savours
and
in
this
when
the
cook
has
any
measure
of
natural
or
acquired
skill
we
most
notably
succeed
our
beef
is
veritably
beef
at
its
best
such
beef
as
can
be
eaten
in
no
other
country
under
the
sun
our
mutton
is
mutton
in
its
purest
essence
think
of
a
shoulder
of
southdown
at
the
moment
when
the
first
jet
of
gravy
starts
under
the
carving
knife
each
of
our
vegetables
yields
its
separate
and
characteristic
sweetness
it
never
occurs
to
us
to
disguise
the
genuine
flavour
of
food
if
such
a
process
be
necessary
then
something
is
wrong
with
the
food
itself
some
wiseacre
scoffed
at
us
as
the
people
with
only
one
sauce
the
fact
is
we
have
as
many
sauces
as
we
have
kinds
of
meat
each
in
the
process
of
cookery
yields
its
native
sap
and
this
is
the
best
of
all
sauces
conceivable
only
english
folk
know
what
is
meant
by
consequently
the
english
alone
are
competent
to
speak
on
the
question
of
sauce
to
be
sure
this
culinary
principle
presupposes
food
of
the
finest
quality
if
your
beef
and
your
mutton
have
flavours
scarcely
distinguishable
whilst
both
this
and
that
might
conceivably
be
veal
you
will
go
to
work
in
quite
a
different
way
your
object
must
then
be
to
disguise
to
counterfeit
to
add
an
alien
relish
in
short
to
do
anything
insist
upon
the
natural
quality
of
the
viand
happily
the
english
have
never
been
driven
to
these
expedients
be
it
flesh
fowl
or
fish
each
comes
to
table
so
distinctly
and
eminently
itself
that
by
no
possibility
could
it
be
confused
with
anything
else
give
your
average
cook
a
bit
of
cod
and
tell
her
to
dress
it
in
her
own
way
the
good
creature
will
carefully
boil
it
and
there
an
end
of
the
matter
and
by
no
exercise
of
art
could
she
have
so
treated
the
fish
as
to
make
more
manifest
and
enjoyable
that
special
savour
which
heaven
has
bestowed
upon
cod
think
of
our
array
of
joints
how
royal
is
each
in
its
own
way
and
how
utterly
unlike
any
of
the
others
picture
a
boiled
leg
of
mutton
it
is
mutton
yes
and
mutton
of
the
best
nature
has
bestowed
upon
man
no
sweeter
morsel
but
the
same
joint
roasted
is
mutton
too
and
how
divinely
different
the
point
is
that
these
differences
are
natural
that
in
eliciting
them
we
obey
the
eternal
law
of
things
and
no
human
caprice
your
artificial
relish
is
here
not
only
needless
but
offensive
in
the
case
of
veal
we
demand
stuffing
yes
for
veal
is
a
somewhat
insipid
meat
and
by
experience
we
have
discovered
the
best
method
of
throwing
into
relief
such
inherent
goodness
as
it
has
the
stuffing
does
not
disguise
nor
seek
to
disguise
it
accentuates
good
veal
stuffing
reflect
is
in
itself
a
triumph
of
culinary
instinct
so
bland
it
is
and
yet
so
powerful
upon
the
gastric
juices
did
i
call
veal
insipid
i
must
add
that
it
is
only
so
in
comparison
with
english
beef
and
mutton
when
i
think
of
the
brown
on
the
edge
of
a
really
fine
cut
of
veal
viii
as
so
often
when
my
thought
has
gone
forth
in
praise
of
things
english
i
find
myself
tormented
by
an
the
reflection
that
i
have
praised
a
time
gone
by
now
in
this
matter
of
english
meat
a
newspaper
tells
me
that
english
beef
is
that
the
best
meat
bearing
that
name
has
merely
been
fed
up
in
england
for
a
short
time
before
killing
well
well
we
can
only
be
thankful
that
the
quality
is
still
so
good
real
english
mutton
still
exists
i
suppose
it
would
surprise
me
if
any
other
country
could
produce
the
shoulder
i
had
yesterday
who
knows
perhaps
even
our
own
cookery
has
seen
its
best
days
it
is
a
lamentable
fact
that
the
multitude
of
english
people
nowadays
never
taste
roasted
meat
what
they
call
by
that
name
is
baked
in
the
oven
a
totally
different
thing
though
it
may
i
admit
be
inferior
only
to
the
right
roast
oh
the
sirloin
of
old
times
the
sirloin
which
i
can
remember
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
that
was
english
and
no
mistake
and
all
the
history
of
civilization
could
show
nothing
on
the
table
of
mankind
to
equal
it
to
clap
that
joint
into
a
steamy
oven
would
have
been
a
crime
unpardonable
by
gods
and
man
have
i
not
with
my
own
eyes
seen
it
turning
turning
on
the
spit
the
scent
it
diffused
was
in
itself
a
cure
for
dyspepsia
it
is
very
long
since
i
tasted
a
slice
of
boiled
beef
i
have
a
suspicion
that
the
thing
is
becoming
rare
in
a
household
such
as
mine
the
round
is
impracticable
of
necessity
it
must
be
large
altogether
too
large
for
our
requirements
but
what
exquisite
memories
does
my
mind
preserve
the
very
colouring
of
a
round
how
rich
it
is
yet
how
delicate
and
how
subtly
varied
the
odour
is
totally
distinct
from
that
of
roast
beef
and
yet
it
is
beef
incontestable
hot
of
course
with
carrots
it
is
a
dish
for
a
king
but
cold
it
is
nobler
oh
the
thin
broad
slice
with
just
its
fringe
of
consistent
fat
we
are
sparing
of
condiments
but
such
as
we
use
are
the
best
that
man
has
invented
and
we
know
to
use
them
i
have
heard
an
impatient
innovator
scoff
at
the
english
law
on
the
subject
of
mustard
and
demand
why
in
the
nature
of
things
mustard
should
not
be
eaten
with
mutton
the
answer
is
very
simple
this
law
has
been
made
by
the
english
palate
which
is
impeccable
i
maintain
it
is
impeccable
your
educated
englishman
is
an
infallible
guide
in
all
that
relates
to
the
table
the
man
of
superior
intellect
said
tennyson
justifying
his
love
of
boiled
beef
and
new
potatoes
knows
what
is
good
to
eat
and
i
would
extend
it
to
all
civilized
natives
of
our
country
we
are
content
with
nothing
but
the
finest
savours
the
truest
combinations
our
wealth
and
happy
natural
circumstances
have
allowed
us
an
education
of
the
palate
of
which
our
natural
aptitude
was
worthy
think
by
the
bye
of
those
new
potatoes
just
mentioned
our
cook
when
dressing
them
puts
into
the
saucepan
a
sprig
of
mint
this
is
genius
no
otherwise
could
the
flavour
of
the
vegetable
be
so
perfectly
yet
so
delicately
emphasized
the
mint
is
there
and
we
know
it
yet
our
palate
knows
only
the
young
potato
ix
there
is
to
me
an
odd
pathos
in
the
literature
of
vegetarianism
i
remember
the
day
when
i
read
these
periodicals
and
pamphlets
with
all
the
zest
of
hunger
and
poverty
vigorously
seeking
to
persuade
myself
that
flesh
was
an
altogether
superfluous
and
even
a
repulsive
food
if
ever
such
things
fall
under
my
eyes
nowadays
i
am
touched
with
a
half
humorous
compassion
for
the
people
whose
necessity
not
their
will
consents
to
this
chemical
view
of
diet
there
comes
before
me
a
vision
of
certain
vegetarian
restaurants
where
at
a
minim
outlay
i
have
often
enough
made
believe
to
satisfy
my
craving
stomach
where
i
have
swallowed
savoury
cutlet
vegetable
steak
and
i
know
not
what
windy
insufficiencies
tricked
up
under
specious
names
one
place
do
i
recall
where
you
had
a
complete
dinner
for
sixpence
i
dare
not
try
to
remember
the
items
but
well
indeed
do
i
see
the
faces
of
the
guests
poor
clerks
and
shopboys
bloodless
girls
and
women
of
many
sorts
all
endeavouring
to
find
a
relish
in
lentil
soup
and
haricot
it
was
a
grotesquely
sight
i
hate
with
a
bitter
hatred
the
names
of
lentils
and
haricots
those
pretentious
cheats
of
the
appetite
those
tabulated
humbugs
those
certificated
aridities
calling
themselves
human
food
an
ounce
of
either
we
are
told
is
equivalent
to
how
many
pounds
of
the
best
steak
there
are
not
many
ounces
of
common
sense
in
the
brain
of
him
who
proves
it
or
of
him
who
believes
it
in
some
countries
this
stuff
is
eaten
by
choice
in
england
only
dire
need
can
compel
to
its
consumption
lentils
and
haricots
are
not
merely
insipid
frequent
use
of
them
causes
something
like
nausea
preach
and
tabulate
as
you
will
the
english
palate
which
is
the
supreme
judge
rejects
this
farinaceous
makeshift
even
as
it
rejects
vegetables
without
the
natural
concomitant
of
meat
as
it
rejects
and
for
a
meal
as
it
rejects
lemonade
and
offered
as
substitutes
for
honest
beer
what
is
the
intellectual
and
moral
state
of
that
man
who
really
believes
that
chemical
analysis
can
be
an
equivalent
for
natural
gusto
i
will
get
more
nourishment
out
of
an
inch
of
right
cambridge
sausage
aye
out
of
a
couple
of
ounces
of
honest
tripe
than
can
be
yielded
me
by
half
a
hundredweight
of
the
best
lentils
ever
grown
x
talking
of
vegetables
can
the
inhabited
globe
offer
anything
to
vie
with
the
english
potato
justly
steamed
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
always
or
often
to
be
seen
on
our
tables
for
the
steaming
of
a
potato
is
one
of
the
great
achievements
of
culinary
art
but
when
it
set
before
you
how
flesh
and
spirit
exult
a
modest
palate
will
find
more
than
simple
comfort
in
your
boiled
potato
of
every
day
as
served
in
the
decent
household
new
or
old
it
is
beyond
challenge
delectable
try
to
think
that
civilized
nations
exist
to
whom
this
food
is
unknown
nay
who
speak
of
it
on
hearsay
with
contempt
such
critics
little
as
they
suspect
it
never
ate
a
potato
in
their
lives
what
they
have
swallowed
under
that
name
was
the
vegetable
with
all
its
exquisite
characteristics
vulgarized
or
destroyed
picture
the
ball
of
flour
as
housewives
call
it
lying
in
the
dish
diffusing
the
softest
subtlest
aroma
ready
to
crumble
all
but
to
melt
as
soon
as
it
is
touched
recall
its
gust
and
its
blending
so
consummately
with
that
of
the
joint
hot
or
cold
then
think
of
the
same
potato
cooked
in
any
other
way
and
what
sadness
will
come
upon
you
xi
it
angers
me
to
pass
a
grocer
shop
and
see
in
the
window
a
display
of
foreign
butter
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
makes
one
gloom
over
the
prospects
of
england
the
deterioration
of
english
butter
is
one
of
the
worst
signs
of
the
moral
state
of
our
people
naturally
this
article
of
food
would
at
once
betray
a
decline
in
the
virtues
of
its
maker
butter
must
be
a
subject
of
the
dairyman
honest
pride
or
there
is
no
hope
of
its
goodness
begin
to
save
your
labour
to
aim
at
dishonest
profits
to
feel
disgust
or
contempt
for
your
work
and
the
churn
declares
every
one
of
these
vices
they
must
be
very
prevalent
for
it
is
getting
to
be
a
rare
thing
to
eat
english
butter
which
is
even
tolerable
what
england
dependent
for
upon
france
denmark
america
had
we
but
one
true
statesman
but
one
genuine
leader
of
the
people
the
ears
of
english
landowners
and
farmers
would
ring
and
tingle
with
this
proof
of
their
imbecility
nobody
cares
who
cares
for
anything
but
the
show
and
bluster
which
are
threatening
our
ruin
english
food
not
long
ago
the
best
in
the
world
is
falling
off
in
quality
and
even
our
national
genius
for
cooking
shows
a
decline
to
anyone
who
knows
england
these
are
facts
significant
enough
foolish
persons
have
prated
about
our
insular
cuisine
demanding
its
reform
on
continental
models
and
they
have
found
too
many
like
unto
themselves
who
were
ready
to
listen
the
result
will
be
before
long
that
our
excellence
will
be
forgotten
and
paltry
methods
be
universally
introduced
together
with
the
indifferent
viands
to
which
they
are
suited
yet
if
any
generality
at
all
be
true
it
is
a
plain
fact
that
english
diet
and
english
virtue
in
the
largest
sense
of
the
word
are
inseparably
bound
together
our
supremacy
in
this
matter
of
the
table
came
with
little
taking
of
thought
what
we
should
now
do
is
to
reflect
upon
the
things
which
used
to
be
instinctive
perceive
the
reasons
of
our
excellence
and
set
to
work
to
it
of
course
the
vilest
cooking
in
the
kingdom
is
found
in
london
is
it
not
with
the
exorbitant
growth
of
london
that
many
an
ill
has
spread
over
the
land
london
is
the
antithesis
of
the
domestic
ideal
a
social
reformer
would
not
even
glance
in
that
direction
but
would
turn
all
his
zeal
upon
small
towns
and
country
districts
where
blight
may
perhaps
be
arrested
and
whence
some
day
a
reconstituted
national
life
may
act
upon
the
great
centre
of
corruption
i
had
far
rather
see
england
covered
with
schools
of
cookery
than
with
schools
of
the
ordinary
kind
the
issue
would
be
infinitely
more
hopeful
little
girls
should
be
taught
cooking
and
baking
more
assiduously
than
they
are
taught
to
read
but
with
ever
in
view
the
great
english
principle
that
food
is
only
cooked
aright
when
it
yields
the
utmost
of
its
native
and
characteristic
savour
let
sauces
be
utterly
forbidden
save
the
natural
sauce
made
of
gravy
in
the
same
way
with
sweets
keep
in
view
the
insurpassable
english
ideals
of
baked
tarts
or
pies
if
so
you
call
them
and
boiled
puddings
as
they
are
the
wholesomest
so
are
they
the
most
delicious
of
sweet
cakes
yet
invented
it
is
merely
a
question
of
having
them
well
made
and
cooked
bread
again
we
are
getting
used
to
bread
of
poor
quality
and
but
the
english
loaf
at
its
best
such
as
you
were
once
sure
of
getting
in
every
village
is
the
faultless
form
of
the
staff
of
life
think
of
the
glorious
revolution
that
could
be
wrought
in
our
troubled
england
if
it
could
be
ordained
that
no
maid
of
whatever
rank
might
become
a
wife
unless
she
had
proved
her
ability
to
make
and
bake
a
perfect
loaf
of
bread

the

s
writes
me
a
kindly
letter
he
is
troubled
by
the
thought
of
my
loneliness
that
i
should
choose
to
live
in
such
a
place
as
this
through
the
summer
he
can
understand
but
surely
i
should
do
better
to
come
to
town
for
the
winter
how
on
earth
do
i
spend
the
dark
days
and
the
long
evenings
i
chuckle
over
the
good
s
sympathy
dark
days
are
few
in
happy
devon
and
such
as
befall
have
never
brought
me
a
moment
tedium
the
long
wild
winter
of
the
north
would
try
my
spirits
but
here
the
season
that
follows
autumn
is
merely
one
of
rest
nature
annual
slumber
and
i
share
in
the
restful
influence
often
enough
i
pass
an
hour
in
mere
drowsing
by
the
fireside
frequently
i
let
my
book
drop
satisfied
to
muse
but
more
often
than
not
the
winter
day
is
blest
with
sunshine
the
soft
beam
which
is
nature
smile
in
dreaming
i
go
forth
and
wander
far
it
pleases
me
to
note
changes
of
landscape
when
the
leaves
have
fallen
i
see
streams
and
ponds
which
during
summer
were
hidden
my
favourite
lanes
have
an
unfamiliar
aspect
and
i
become
better
acquainted
with
them
then
there
is
a
rare
beauty
in
the
structure
of
trees
ungarmented
and
if
perchance
snow
or
frost
have
silvered
their
tracery
against
the
sober
sky
it
becomes
a
marvel
which
never
tires
day
by
day
i
look
at
the
coral
buds
on
the
something
of
regret
will
mingle
with
my
joy
when
they
begin
to
break
in
the
middle
years
of
my
life
those
years
that
were
the
worst
of
all
i
used
to
dread
the
sound
of
a
winter
storm
which
woke
me
in
the
night
wind
and
rain
lashing
the
house
filled
me
with
miserable
memories
and
apprehensions
i
lay
thinking
of
the
savage
struggle
of
man
with
man
and
often
saw
before
me
no
better
fate
than
to
be
trampled
down
into
the
mud
of
life
the
wind
wail
seemed
to
me
the
voice
of
a
world
in
anguish
rain
was
the
weeping
of
the
feeble
and
the
oppressed
but
nowadays
i
can
lie
and
listen
to
a
with
no
intolerable
thoughts
at
worst
i
fall
into
a
compassionate
sadness
as
i
remember
those
i
loved
and
whom
i
shall
see
no
more
for
myself
there
is
even
comfort
in
the
roaring
dark
for
i
feel
the
strength
of
the
good
walls
about
me
and
my
safety
from
squalid
peril
such
as
pursued
me
through
all
my
labouring
life
blow
blow
thou
winter
wind
thou
canst
not
blow
away
the
modest
wealth
which
makes
my
security
nor
can
any
rain
upon
the
roof
put
my
soul
to
question
for
life
has
given
me
all
i
ever
asked
infinitely
more
than
i
ever
hoped
and
in
no
corner
of
my
mind
does
there
lurk
a
coward
fear
of
death
xiii
if
some
stranger
from
abroad
asked
me
to
point
out
to
him
the
most
noteworthy
things
in
england
i
should
first
of
all
consider
his
intellect
were
he
a
man
of
everyday
level
i
might
indicate
for
his
wonder
and
admiration
greater
london
the
black
country
south
lancashire
and
other
features
of
our
civilization
which
despite
eager
rivalry
still
maintain
our
modern
in
the
creation
of
ugliness
if
on
the
other
hand
he
seemed
a
man
of
brains
it
would
be
my
pleasure
to
take
him
to
one
of
those
old
villages
in
the
midlands
or
the
west
which
lie
at
some
distance
from
a
railway
station
and
in
aspect
are
still
untouched
by
the
baser
tendencies
of
the
time
here
i
would
tell
my
traveller
he
saw
something
which
england
alone
can
show
the
simple
beauty
of
the
architecture
its
perfect
adaptation
to
the
natural
surroundings
the
neatness
of
everything
though
without
formality
the
general
cleanness
and
good
repair
the
grace
of
cottage
gardens
that
tranquillity
and
security
which
make
a
music
in
the
mind
of
him
who
gazes
these
are
what
a
man
must
see
and
feel
if
he
would
appreciate
the
worth
and
the
power
of
england
the
people
which
has
made
for
itself
such
homes
as
these
is
distinguished
above
all
things
by
its
love
of
order
it
has
understood
as
no
other
people
the
truth
that
order
is
heaven
first
law
with
order
it
is
natural
to
find
stability
and
the
combination
of
these
qualities
as
seen
in
domestic
life
results
in
that
peculiarly
english
product
our
name
for
which
though
but
a
pale
shadow
of
the
thing
itself
has
been
borrowed
by
other
countries
comfort
then
englishman
need
of
comfort
is
one
of
his
best
characteristics
the
possibility
that
he
may
change
in
this
respect
and
become
indifferent
to
his
old
ideal
of
physical
and
mental
ease
is
the
gravest
danger
manifest
in
our
day
for
comfort
mind
you
does
not
concern
the
body
alone
the
beauty
and
orderliness
of
an
englishman
home
derive
their
value
nay
their
very
existence
from
the
spirit
which
directs
his
whole
life
walk
from
the
village
to
the
noble
mansion
it
too
is
perfect
of
its
kind
it
has
the
dignity
of
age
its
walls
are
beautiful
the
gardens
the
park
about
it
are
such
as
can
be
found
only
in
england
lovely
beyond
compare
and
all
this
represents
the
same
moral
characteristics
as
the
english
cottage
but
with
greater
activities
and
responsibilities
if
the
noble
grow
tired
of
his
mansion
and
letting
it
to
some
crude
owner
of
millions
go
to
live
in
hotels
and
hired
villas
if
the
cottager
sicken
of
his
village
roof
and
transport
himself
to
the
sixth
floor
of
a
block
in
shoreditch
one
sees
but
too
well
that
the
one
and
the
other
have
lost
the
old
english
sense
of
comfort
and
in
losing
it
have
suffered
degradation
alike
as
men
and
as
citizens
it
is
not
a
question
of
exchanging
one
form
of
comfort
for
another
the
instinct
which
made
an
englishman
has
in
these
cases
perished
perhaps
it
is
perishing
from
among
us
altogether
killed
by
new
social
and
political
conditions
one
who
looks
at
villages
of
the
new
type
at
the
quarters
of
towns
at
the
rising
of
flats
among
the
dwellings
of
the
wealthy
has
little
choice
but
to
think
so
there
may
soon
come
a
day
when
though
the
word
comfort
continues
to
be
used
in
many
languages
the
thing
it
signifies
will
be
discoverable
nowhere
at
all
xiv
if
the
ingenious
foreigner
found
himself
in
some
village
of
manufacturing
lancashire
he
would
be
otherwise
impressed
here
something
of
the
power
of
england
might
be
revealed
to
him
but
of
england
worth
little
enough
hard
ugliness
would
everywhere
assail
his
eyes
the
visages
and
voices
of
the
people
would
seem
to
him
thoroughly
akin
to
their
surroundings
scarcely
could
one
find
in
any
civilized
nation
a
more
notable
contrast
than
that
between
these
two
english
villages
and
their
inhabitants
yet
lancashire
is
english
and
there
among
the
mill
chimneys
in
the
hideous
little
street
folk
are
living
whose
domestic
thoughts
claim
undeniable
kindred
with
those
of
the
villagers
of
the
kinder
south
but
to
understand
how
comfort
and
the
virtues
it
implies
can
exist
amid
such
conditions
one
must
penetrate
to
the
hearthside
the
door
must
be
shut
the
curtain
drawn
here
home
does
not
extend
beyond
the
threshold
after
all
this
grimy
row
of
houses
ugliest
that
man
ever
conceived

more
representative
of

than
the
lovely

the
eye
even
as
ploughman
or
shepherd
he
differs
notably
from
him
of
the
same
calling
in
the
weald
or
on
the
downs
but
the
frank
brutality
of
the
man
in
all
externals
has
been
encouraged
rather
than
mitigated
by
the
course
his
civilization
has
taken
and
hence
it
is
that
unless
one
knows
him
well
enough
to
respect
him
he
seems
even
yet
stamped
with
the
of
his
folk
as
they
were
a
century
and
a
half
ago
his
fierce
shyness
his
arrogant
are
notes
of
a
primitive
state
naturally
he
never
learnt
to
house
himself
as
did
the
southerner
for
climate
as
well
as
social
circumstance
was
unfavourable
to
all
the
graces
of
life
and
now
one
can
only
watch
the
encroachment
of
his
rule
upon
that
old
that
true
england
whose
strength
and
virtue
were
so
differently
manifested
this
fair
broad
land
of
the
lovely
villages
signifies
little
save
to
the
antiquary
the
poet
the
painter
vainly
indeed
should
i
show
its
beauty
and
its
peace
to
the
observant
foreigner
he
would
but
smile
and
with
a
glance
at
the
just
coming
along
the
road
indicate
the
direction
of
his
thoughts
xv
nothing
in
all
homer
pleases
me
more
than
the
bedstead
of
odysseus
i
have
tried
to
turn
the
passage
describing
it
into
english
verse
thus
here
in
my
garth
a
goodly
olive
grew
thick
was
the
noble
leafage
of
its
prime
and
like
a
carven
column
rose
the
trunk
this
tree
about
i
built
my
chamber
walls
laying
great
stone
on
stone
and
roofed
them
well
and
in
the
portal
set
a
comely
door
and
tightly
closing
then
with
axe
i
lopped
the
leafy
olive
branching
head
and
hewed
the
bole
to
shapeliness
and
smoothed
it
craftsmanlike
and
grooved
and
pierced
making
the
rooted
timber
where
it
grew
a
corner
of
my
couch
labouring
on
i
fashioned
all
the
which
complete
the
wood
i
overlaid
with
shining
gear
of
gold
of
silver
and
of
ivory
and
last
between
the
endlong
beams
i
stretched
stout
thongs
of
dipped
in
purple
dye
xxiii
did
anyone
ever
imitate
the
admirable
precedent
were
i
a
young
man
and
an
owner
of
land
assuredly
i
would
do
so
choose
some
goodly
tree
cut
away
head
and
branches
leave
just
the
clean
trunk
and
build
your
house
about
it
in
such
manner
that
the
top
of
the
rooted
timber
rises
a
couple
of
feet
above
your
bedroom
floor
the
trunk
need
not
be
manifest
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
but
i
should
prefer
to
have
it
so
i
am
a
it
should
be
as
the
visible
presence
of
a
household
god
and
how
could
one
more
nobly
symbolize
the
sacredness
of
home
there
can
be
no
home
without
the
sense
of
permanence
and
without
home
there
is
no
civilization
as
england
will
discover
when
the
greater
part
of
her
population
have
become
nomads
in
some
ideal
commonwealth
one
can
imagine
the
odyssean
bed
a
normal
institution
every
head
of
a
household
cottager
or
lord
for
the
commonwealth
must
have
its
lords
go
to
lying
down
to
rest
as
did
his
fathers
in
the
chamber
of
the
tree
this
one
fancies
were
a
somewhat
more
fitting
nuptial
chamber
than
the
chance
bedroom
of
a
hotel
odysseus
building
his
home
is
man
performing
a
supreme
act
of
piety
through
all
the
ages
that
picture
must
retain
its
profound
significance
note
the
tree
he
chose
the
olive
sacred
to
athena
emblem
of
peace
when
he
and
the
wise
goddess
meet
together
to
scheme
destruction
of
the
princes
they
sit
greek
text
their
talk
is
of
bloodshed
true
but
in
punishment
of
those
who
have
outraged
the
sanctity
of
the
hearth
and
to
after
purification
domestic
calm
and
security
it
is
one
of
the
dreary
aspects
of
modern
life
that
natural
symbolism
has
all
but
perished
we
have
no
consecrated
tree
the
oak
once
held
a
place
in
english
hearts
but
who
now
reveres
it
our
trust
is
in
gods
of
iron
money
is
made
at
christmas
out
of
holly
and
mistletoe
but
who
save
the
vendors
would
greatly
care
if
no
green
branch
were
procurable
one
symbol
indeed
has
obscured
all
others
the
minted
round
of
metal
and
one
may
safely
say
that
of
all
the
ages
since
a
coin
first
became
the
symbol
of
power
ours
is
that
in
which
it
yields
to
the
majority
of
its
possessors
the
poorest
return
in
heart
contentment
xvi
i
have
been
dull
haunted
by
the
thought
of
how
much
there
is
that
i
would
fain
know
and
how
little
i
can
hope
to
learn
the
scope
of
knowledge
has
become
so
vast
i
put
aside
nearly
all
physical
investigation
to
me
it
is
naught
or
only
at
moments
a
matter
of
idle
curiosity
this
would
seem
to
be
a
considerable
clearing
of
the
field
but
it
leaves
what
is
practically
the
infinite
to
run
over
a
list
of
only
my
favourite
subjects
those
to
which
all
my
life
long
i
have
more
or
less
applied
myself
studies
which
hold
in
my
mind
the
place
of
hobbies
is
to
open
vistas
of
intellectual
despair
in
an
old
i
jotted
down
such
a
list
things
i
hope
to
know
and
to
know
well
i
was
then
four
and
twenty
reading
it
with
the
eyes
of
i
must
needs
laugh
there
appear
such
modest
items
as
the
history
of
the
christian
church
up
to
the
reformation
all
greek
poetry
the
field
of
mediaeval
romance
german
literature
from
lessing
to
heine
dante
not
one
of
these
shall
i
ever
know
and
know
well
not
any
one
of
them
yet
here
i
am
buying
books
which
lead
me
into
endless
paths
of
new
temptation
what
have
i
to
do
with
egypt
yet
i
have
been
beguiled
by
flinders
petrie
and
by
maspero
how
can
i
pretend
to
meddle
with
the
ancient
geography
of
asia
minor
yet
here
have
i
bought
astonishing
book
and
have
even
read
with
a
sort
of
troubled
enjoyment
a
good
many
pages
of
it
troubled
because
i
have
but
to
reflect
a
moment
and
i
see
that
all
this
kind
of
thing
is
mere
futile
effort
of
the
intellect
when
the
time
for
serious
intellectual
effort
is
over
it
all
means
of
course
that
owing
to
defective
opportunity
owing
still
more
perhaps
to
lack
of
method
and
persistence
a
possibility
that
was
in
me
has
been
wasted
lost
my
life
has
been
merely
tentative
a
broken
series
of
false
starts
and
hopeless
new
beginnings
if
i
allowed
myself
to
indulge
that
mood
i
could
revolt
against
the
ordinance
which
allows
me
no
second
chance
mihi
praeteritos
referat
si
jupiter
if
i
could
but
start
again
with
only
the
experience
there
gained
i
mean
make
a
new
beginning
of
my
intellectual
life
nothing
else
o
heaven
nothing
else
even
amid
poverty
i
could
do
so
much
better
keeping
before
my
eyes
some
definite
some
not
unattainable
good
sternly
dismissing
the
impracticable
the
wasteful
and
in
doing
so
become
perhaps
an
pedant
to
whom
would
be
for
ever
dead
the
possibility
of
such
enjoyment
as
i
know
in
these
final
years
who
can
say
perhaps
the
sole
condition
of
my
progress
to
this
state
of
mind
and
heart
which
make
my
happiness
was
that
very
stumbling
and
erring
which
i
so
regret
xvii
why
do
i
give
so
much
of
my
time
to
the
reading
of
history
is
it
in
any
sense
profitable
to
me
what
new
light
can
i
hope
for
on
the
nature
of
man
what
new
guidance
for
the
direction
of
my
own
life
through
the
few
years
that
may
remain
to
me
but
it
is
with
no
such
purpose
that
i
read
these
voluminous
books
they
gratify
or
seem
to
gratify
a
mere
curiosity
and
scarcely
have
i
closed
a
volume
when
the
greater
part
of
what
i
have
read
in
it
is
forgotten
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
remember
all
many
a
time
i
have
said
to
myself
that
i
would
close
the
dreadful
record
of
human
life
lay
it
for
ever
aside
and
try
to
forget
it
somebody
declares
that
history
is
a
manifestation
of
the
triumph
of
good
over
evil
the
good
prevails
now
and
then
no
doubt
but
how
local
and
transitory
is
such
triumph
if
historic
tomes
had
a
voice
it
would
sound
as
one
long
moan
of
anguish
think
steadfastly
of
the
past
and
one
sees
that
only
by
defect
of
imaginative
power
can
any
man
endure
to
dwell
with
it
history
is
a
nightmare
of
horrors
we
relish
it
because
we
love
pictures
and
because
all
that
man
has
suffered
is
to
man
rich
in
interest
but
make
real
to
yourself
the
vision
of
every
page
stand
in
the
presence
of
the
ravening
conqueror
the
savage
tyrant
tread
the
stones
of
the
dungeon
and
of
the
feel
the
fire
of
the
stake
hear
the
cries
of
that
multitude
which
no
man
can
number
the
victims
of
calamity
of
oppression
of
fierce
injustice
in
its
myriad
forms
in
every
land
in
every
age
and
what
joy
have
you
of
your
historic
reading
one
would
need
to
be
a
devil
to
understand
it
thus
and
yet
to
delight
in
it
injustice
there
is
the
loathed
crime
which
curses
the
memory
of
the
world
the
slave
doomed
by
his
lord
caprice
to
perish
under
tortures
one
feels
it
a
dreadful
and
intolerable
thing
but
it
is
merely
the
crude
presentment
of
what
has
been
done
and
endured
a
million
times
in
every
stage
of
civilization
oh
the
last
thoughts
of
those
who
have
agonized
unto
death
amid
wrongs
to
which
no
man
would
give
ear
that
appeal
of
innocence
in
anguish
to
the
hard
mute
heavens
were
there
only
one
such
instance
in
all
the
chronicles
of
time
it
should
doom
the
past
to
abhorred
oblivion
yet
injustice
the
basest
the
most
ferocious
is
inextricable
from
warp
and
woof
in
the
tissue
of
things
gone
by
and
if
anyone
soothes
himself
with
the
reflection
that
such
outrages
can
happen
no
more
that
mankind
has
passed
beyond
such
hideous
possibility
he
is
better
acquainted
with
books
than
with
human
nature
it
were
wiser
to
spend
my
hours
with
the
books
which
bring
no
aftertaste
of
bitterness
with
the
great
poets
whom
i
love
with
the
thinkers
with
the
gentle
writers
of
pages
that
soothe
and
tranquillize
many
a
volume
regards
me
from
the
shelf
as
though
reproachfully
shall
i
never
again
take
it
in
my
hands
yet
the
words
are
golden
and
i
would
fain
treasure
them
all
in
my
heart
memory
perhaps
the
last
fault
of
which
i
shall
cure
myself
is
that
habit
of
mind
which
urges
me
to
seek
knowledge
was
i
not
yesterday
on
the
point
of
ordering
a
huge
work
of
erudition
which
i
should
certainly
never
have
read
through
and
which
would
only
have
served
to
waste
precious
days
it
is
the
puritan
in
my
blood
i
suppose
which
forbids
me
to
recognise
frankly
that
all
i
have
now
to
do
is
to
this
is
wisdom
the
time
for
acquisition
has
gone
by
i
am
not
foolish
enough
to
set
myself
learning
a
new
language
why
should
i
try
to
store
my
memory
with
useless
knowledge
of
the
past
come
once
more
before
i
die
i
will

xviii
somebody
has
been
making
a
speech
reported
at
a
couple
of
length
in
the
paper
as
i
glance
down
the
waste
of
print
one
word
catches
my
eye
again
and
again
it
all
about
science
and
therefore
does
concern
me
i
wonder
whether
there
are
many
men
who
have
the
same
feeling
with
regard
to
science
as
i
have
it
is
something
more
than
a
prejudice
often
it
takes
the
form
of
a
dread
almost
a
terror
even
those
branches
of
science
which
are
concerned
with
things
that
interest
me
which
deal
with
plants
and
animals
and
the
heaven
of
stars
even
these
i
can
not
contemplate
without
uneasiness
a
spiritual
disaffection
new
discoveries
new
theories
however
they
engage
my
intelligence
soon
weary
me
and
in
some
way
depress
when
it
comes
to
other
kinds
of
science
the
sciences
blatant
and
ubiquitous
the
science
by
which
men
become
millionaires
i
am
possessed
with
an
angry
hostility
a
resentful
apprehension
this
was
born
in
me
no
doubt
i
can
not
trace
it
to
circumstances
of
my
life
or
to
any
particular
moment
of
my
mental
growth
my
boyish
delight
in
carlyle
doubtless
nourished
the
temper
but
did
not
carlyle
so
delight
me
because
of
what
was
already
in
my
mind
i
remember
as
a
lad
looking
at
complicated
machinery
with
a
shrinking
uneasiness
which
of
course
i
did
not
understand
i
remember
the
sort
of
disturbed
contemptuousness
with
which
in
my
time
of
examinations
i
dismissed
science
papers
it
is
intelligible
enough
to
me
now
that
unformed
fear
the
ground
of
my
antipathy
has
grown
clear
enough
i
hate
and
fear
science
because
of
my
conviction
that
for
long
to
come
if
not
for
ever
it
will
be
the
remorseless
enemy
of
mankind
i
see
it
destroying
all
simplicity
and
gentleness
of
life
all
the
beauty
of
the
world
i
see
it
restoring
barbarism
under
a
mask
of
civilization
i
see
it
darkening
men
minds
and
hardening
their
hearts
i
see
it
bringing
a
time
of
vast
conflicts
which
will
pale
into
insignificance
the
thousand
wars
of
old
and
as
likely
as
not
will
whelm
all
the
laborious
advances
of
mankind
in
chaos
yet
to
rail
against
it
is
as
idle
as
to
quarrel
with
any
other
force
of
nature
for
myself
i
can
hold
apart
and
see
as
little
as
possible
of
the
thing
i
deem
accursed
but
i
think
of
some
who
are
dear
to
me
whose
life
will
be
lived
in
the
hard
and
fierce
new
age
the
roaring
jubilee
of
last
summer
was
for
me
an
occasion
of
sadness
it
meant
that
so
much
was
over
and
gone
so
much
of
good
and
noble
the
like
of
which
the
world
will
not
see
again
and
that
a
new
time
of
which
only
the
perils
are
clearly
visible
is
rushing
upon
us
oh
the
generous
hopes
and
aspirations
of
forty
years
ago
science
then
was
seen
as
the
deliverer
only
a
few
could
prophesy
its
tyranny
could
foresee
that
it
would
revive
old
evils
and
trample
on
the
promises
of
its
beginning
this
is
the
course
of
things
we
must
accept
it
but
it
is
some
comfort
to
me
that
i
poor
little
mortal
have
had
no
part
in
bringing
the
tyrant
to
his
throne
xix
the
christmas
bells
drew
me
forth
this
morning
with
but
purpose
i
walked
through
soft
hazy
sunshine
towards
the
city
and
came
into
the
cathedral
close
and
after
lingering
awhile
heard
the
first
notes
of
the
organ
and
so
entered
i
believe
it
is
more
than
thirty
years
since
i
was
in
an
english
church
on
christmas
day
the
old
time
and
the
old
faces
lived
again
for
me
i
saw
myself
on
the
far
side
of
the
abyss
of
years
that
self
which
is
not
myself
at
all
though
i
mark
points
of
kindred
between
the
beings
of
then
and
now
he
who
in
that
other
world
sat
to
hear
the
christmas
gospel
either
heeded
it
not
at
all
rapt
in
his
own
visions
or
listened
only
as
one
in
whose
blood
was
heresy
he
loved
the
notes
of
the
organ
but
even
in
his
childish
mind
distinguished
clearly
between
the
music
and
its
local
motive
more
than
that
he
could
separate
the
melody
of
word
and
of
thought
from
their
dogmatic
significance
enjoying
the
one
whilst
wholly
rejecting
the
other
on
earth
peace
to
men
already
that
line
was
among
the
treasures
of
his
intellect
but
only
no
doubt
because
of
its
rhythm
its
sonority
life
to
him
was
a
striving
for
the
harmonic
in
thought
and
speech
and
through
what
a
tumult
of
unmelodious
circumstance
was
he
beginning
to
fight
his
way
i
listen
with
no
heretical
promptings
the
music
whether
of
organ
or
of
word
is
more
to
me
than
ever
the
literal
meaning
causes
me
no
restiveness
i
felt
only
glad
that
i
had
yielded
to
the
summons
of
the
christmas
bells
i
sat
among
a
congregation
of
shadows
not
in
the
great
cathedral
but
in
a
little
parish
church
far
from
here
when
i
came
forth
it
astonished
me
to
see
the
softly
radiant
sky
and
to
tread
on
the
moist
earth
my
dream
expected
a
canopy
of
cold
grey
and
all
beneath
it
the
gleam
of
snow
it
is
a
piety
to
turn
awhile
and
live
with
the
dead
and
who
can
so
well
indulge
it
as
he
whose
christmas
is
passed
in
no
unhappy
solitude
i
would
not
now
if
i
might
be
one
of
a
joyous
company
it
is
better
to
hear
the
voices
and
to
smile
at
happy
things
which
i
alone
can
remember
when
i
was
scarce
old
enough
to
understand
i
heard
read
by
the
fireside
the
christmas
stanzas
of
in
memoriam
i
have
taken
down
the
volume
and
the
voice
of
so
long
ago
has
read
to
me
once
again
read
as
no
other
ever
did
that
voice
which
taught
me
to
know
poetry
the
voice
which
never
spoke
to
me
but
of
good
and
noble
things
would
i
have
those
accents
overborne
by
a
living
tongue
however
welcome
its
sound
at
another
time
jealously
i
guard
my
christmas
solitude
xx
is
it
true
that
the
english
are
deeply
branded
with
the
vice
of
hypocrisy
the
accusation
of
course
dates
from
the
time
of
the
heads
before
that
nothing
in
the
national
character
could
have
suggested
it
the
england
of
chaucer
the
england
of
shakespeare
assuredly
was
not
hypocrite
the
change
wrought
by
puritanism
introduced
into
the
life
of
the
people
that
new
element
which
ever
since
more
or
less
notably
has
suggested
to
the
observer
a
habit
of
in
morality
and
religion
the
scorn
of
the
cavalier
is
easily
understood
it
created
a
traditional
cromwell
who
till
carlyle
arose
figured
before
the
world
as
our
with
the
decline
of
genuine
puritanism
came
that
peculiarly
english
manifestation
of
piety
and
virtue
which
is
represented
by
pecksniff
a
being
so
utterly
different
from
tartufe
and
perhaps
impossible
to
be
understood
save
by
englishmen
themselves
but
it
is
in
our
own
time
that
the
familiar
reproach
has
been
persistently
levelled
at
us
it
often
sounds
upon
the
lips
of
our
emancipated
youth
it
is
stereotyped
for
daily
impression
in
the
offices
of
continental
newspapers
and
for
the
reason
one
has
not
far
to
look
when
napoleon
called
us
a
nation
of
we
were
nothing
of
the
kind
since
his
day
we
have
become
so
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
and
consider
the
spectacle
of
a
flourishing
tradesman
anything
but
scrupulous
in
his
methods
of
business
who
loses
no
opportunity
of
bidding
all
mankind
to
regard
him
as
a
religious
and
moral
exemplar
this
is
the
actual
show
of
things
with
us
this
is
the
england
seen
by
our
bitterest
censors
there
is
an
excuse
for
those
who
charge
us
with
hypocrisy
but
the
word
is
and
indicates
a
misconception
the
characteristic
of
your
true
hypocrite
is
the
assumption
of
a
virtue
which
not
only
he
has
not
but
which
he
is
incapable
of
possessing
and
in
which
he
does
not
believe
the
hypocrite
may
have
most
likely
has
for
he
is
a
man
of
brains
a
conscious
rule
of
life
but
it
is
never
that
of
the
person
to
whom
his
hypocrisy
is
directed
tartufe
incarnates
him
once
for
all
tartufe
is
by
conviction
an
atheist
and
a
sensualist
he
despises
all
who
regard
life
from
the
contrasted
point
of
view
but
among
englishmen
such
an
attitude
of
mind
has
always
been
extremely
rare
to
presume
it
in
our
typical
who
has
edifying
sentiments
on
his
lips
is
to
fall
into
a
grotesque
error
of
judgment
no
doubt
that
error
is
committed
by
the
ordinary
foreign
journalist
a
man
who
knows
less
than
little
of
english
civilization
more
enlightened
critics
if
they
use
the
word
at
all
do
so
carelessly
when
speaking
with
more
precision
they
call
the
english
pharisaic
and
come
nearer
the
truth
our
vice
is
we
are
essentially
an
old
testament
people
christianity
has
never
entered
into
our
soul
we
see
ourselves
as
the
chosen
and
by
no
effort
of
spiritual
aspiration
can
attain
unto
humility
in
this
there
is
nothing
hypocritic
the
blatant
upstart
who
builds
a
church
lays
out
his
money
in
that
way
not
merely
to
win
social
consideration
in
his
curious
little
soul
he
believes
so
far
as
he
can
believe
anything
that
what
he
has
done
is
pleasing
to
god
and
beneficial
to
mankind
he
may
have
lied
and
cheated
for
every
sovereign
he
possesses
he
may
have
polluted
his
life
with
uncleanness
he
may
have
perpetrated
many
kinds
of
cruelty
and
baseness
but
all
these
things
has
he
done
against
his
conscience
and
as
soon
as
the
opportunity
comes
he
will
make
atonement
for
them
in
the
way
suggested
by
such
faith
as
he
has
the
way
approved
by
public
opinion
his
religion
strictly
defined
is
ineradicable
belief
in
his
own
as
an
englishman
he
holds
as
birthright
the
true
piety
the
true
morals
that
he
has
gone
wrong
is
alas
undeniable
but
never
even
when
leering
most
satirically
did
he
deny
his
creed
when
at
public
dinners
and
elsewhere
he
tuned
his
voice
to
the
note
of
edification
this
man
did
not
utter
the
lie
of
the
hypocrite
he
every
word
he
uttering
high
sentiments
he
spoke
not
as
an
individual
but
as
an
englishman
and
most
thoroughly
did
he
believe
that
all
who
heard
him
owed
in
their
hearts
allegiance
to
the
same
faith
he
is
if
you
like
a
pharisee
but
do
not
misunderstand
his
pharisaism
has
nothing
personal
that
would
be
quite
another
kind
of
man
existing
to
be
sure
in
england
but
not
as
a
national
type
no
he
is
a
pharisee
in
the
minor
degree
with
regard
to
those
of
his
countrymen
who
differ
from
him
in
dogma
he
is
pharisee
absolute
with
regard
to
the
foreigner
and
there
he
stands
representing
an
empire
the
word
hypocrisy
is
perhaps
most
of
all
applied
to
our
behaviour
in
matters
of
sexual
morality
and
here
with
specially
flagrant
misuse
multitudes
of
englishmen
have
thrown
aside
the
national
religious
dogma
but
very
few
indeed
have
abandoned
the
conviction
that
the
rules
of
morality
publicly
upheld
in
england
are
the
best
known
in
the
world
any
one
interested
in
doing
so
can
but
too
easily
demonstrate
that
english
social
life
is
no
purer
than
that
of
most
other
countries
scandals
of
peculiar
grossness
at
no
long
intervals
give
rich
opportunity
to
the
scoffer
the
streets
of
our
great
towns
nightly
present
an
exhibition
the
like
of
which
can
not
be
seen
elsewhere
in
the
world
despite
all
this
your
average
englishman
takes
for
granted
his
country
moral
superiority
and
loses
no
chance
of
proclaiming
it
at
the
expense
of
other
peoples
to
call
him
hypocrite
is
simply
not
to
know
the
man
he
may
for
his
own
part
be
and
lax
of
life
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
believes
in
tell
him
that
english
morality
is
mere
and
he
will
blaze
with
as
honest
anger
as
man
ever
felt
he
is
a
monument
of
again
not
personal
but
national
xxi
i
make
use
of
the
present
tense
but
am
i
speaking
truly
of
present
england
such
powerful
agencies
of
change
have
been
at
work
during
the
last
thirty
years
and
it
is
difficult
nay
impossible
to
ascertain
in
what
degree
they
have
affected
the
national
character
thus
far
one
notes
the
obvious
decline
of
conventional
religion
free
discussion
of
the
old
moral
standards
therewith
a
growth
of
materialism
which
favours
every
anarchic
tendency
is
it
to
be
feared
that
may
be
degenerating
into
the
darker
vice
of
true
hypocrisy
for
the
english
to
lose
belief
in
themselves
not
merely
in
their
potential
goodness
but
in
their
as
examples
and
agents
of
good
would
mean
as
hopeless
a
national
corruption
as
any
recorded
in
history
to
doubt
their
genuine
worship
in
the
past
of
a
very
high
though
not
of
course
the
highest
ethical
ideal
is
impossible
for
any
one
born
and
bred
in
england
no
less
impossible
to
deny
that
those
who
are
rightly
deemed
best
among
us
the
men
and
women
of
gentle
or
humble
birth
who
are
not
infected
by
the
evils
of
the
new
spirit
still
lead
in
a
very
true
sense
honest
sober
and
godly
lives
such
folk
one
knows
were
never
in
a
majority
but
of
old
they
had
a
power
which
made
them
veritable
representatives
of
the
english
if
they
thought
highly
of
themselves
why
the
fact
justified
them
if
they
spoke
at
times
as
pharisees
it
was
a
fault
of
temper
which
carried
with
it
no
grave
condemnation
hypocrisy
was
of
all
forms
of
baseness
that
which
they
most
abhorred
so
is
it
still
with
their
descendants
whether
these
continue
to
speak
among
us
with
authority
no
man
can
certainly
say
if
their
power
is
lost
and
those
who
talk
of
english
hypocrisy
no
longer
use
the
word
amiss
we
shall
soon
know
it
xxii
it
is
time
that
we
gave
a
second
thought
to
puritanism
in
the
heyday
of
release
from
forms
which
had
lost
their
meaning
it
was
natural
to
look
back
on
that
period
of
our
history
with
eyes
that
saw
in
it
nothing
but
fanatical
excess
we
approved
the
picturesque
phrase
which
showed
the
english
mind
going
into
prison
and
having
the
key
turned
upon
it
now
when
the
peril
of
emancipation
becomes
as
manifest
as
was
the
hardship
of
restraint
we
shall
do
well
to
remember
all
the
good
that
lay
in
that
stern
puritan
discipline
how
it
renewed
the
spiritual
vitality
of
our
race
and
made
for
the
civic
freedom
which
is
our
highest
national
privilege
an
age
of
intellectual
glory
is
wont
to
be
paid
for
in
the
general
decline
of
that
which
follows
imagine
england
under
stuart
rule
with
no
faith
but
the
protestantism
of
the
tudor
imagine
not
to
think
of
worse
english
literature
represented
by
cowley
and
the
name
of
milton
unknown
the
puritan
came
as
the
physician
he
brought
his
tonic
at
the
moment
when
lassitude
and
supineness
would
naturally
have
followed
upon
a
supreme
display
of
racial
vitality
regret
if
you
will
that
england
turned
for
her
religion
to
the
books
of
israel
this
suddenly
revealed
sympathy
of
our
race
with
a
fierce
oriental
theocracy
is
perhaps
not
difficult
to
explain
but
one
can
not
help
wishing
that
its
piety
had
taken
another
form
later
there
had
to
come
the
exodus
from
houndsditch
with
how
much
conflict
and
misery
such
however
was
the
price
of
the
soul
health
we
must
accept
the
fact
and
be
content
to
see
its
better
meaning
health
of
course
in
speaking
of
mankind
is
always
a
relative
term
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
conceivable
civilization
puritan
england
was
lamentably
ailing
but
we
must
always
ask
not
how
much
better
off
a
people
might
be
but
how
much
worse
of
all
theological
systems
the
most
convincing
is
manicheism
which
of
course
under
another
name
was
held
by
the
puritans
themselves
what
we
call
restoration
morality
the
morality
that
is
to
say
of
a
king
and
court
might
well
have
become
that
of
the
nation
at
large
under
a
stuart
dynasty
safe
from
religious
revolution
the
political
services
of
puritanism
were
inestimable
they
will
be
more
feelingly
remembered
when
england
has
once
more
to
face
the
danger
of
political
tyranny
i
am
thinking
now
of
its
effects
upon
social
life
to
it
we
owe
the
characteristic
which
in
some
other
countries
is
expressed
by
the
term
english
prudery
the
accusation
implied
being
part
of
the
general
charge
of
hypocrisy
it
is
said
by
observers
among
ourselves
that
the
prudish
habit
of
mind
is
dying
out
and
this
is
looked
upon
as
a
satisfactory
thing
as
a
sign
of
healthy
emancipation
if
by
prude
be
meant
a
secretly
vicious
person
who
affects
an
excessive
decorum
by
all
means
let
the
prude
disappear
even
at
the
cost
of
some
shamelessness
if
on
the
other
hand
a
prude
is
one
who
living
a
decent
life
cultivates
either
by
bent
or
principle
a
somewhat
extreme
delicacy
of
thought
and
speech
with
regard
to
elementary
facts
of
human
nature
then
i
say
that
this
is
most
emphatically
a
fault
in
the
right
direction
and
i
have
no
desire
to
see
its
prevalence
diminish
on
the
whole
it
is
the
latter
meaning
which
certain
foreigners
have
in
mind
when
they
speak
of
english
prudery
at
all
events
as
exhibited
by
women
it
being
not
so
much
an
imputation
on
chastity
as
a
charge
of
conceited
foolishness
an
english
woman
who
typifies
the
may
be
spotless
as
snow
but
she
is
presumed
to
have
snow
other
quality
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
a
thoroughly
absurd
and
intolerable
creature
well
here
is
the
point
of
difference
fastidiousness
of
speech
is
not
a
direct
outcome
of
puritanism
as
our
literature
sufficiently
proves
it
is
a
refinement
of
civilization
following
upon
absorption
into
the
national
life
of
all
the
best
things
which
puritanism
had
to
teach
we
who
know
english
women
by
the
experience
of
a
lifetime
are
well
aware
that
their
careful
choice
of
language
betokens
far
more
often
than
not
a
corresponding
delicacy
of
mind
landor
saw
it
as
a
ridiculous
trait
that
english
people
were
so
in
speaking
of
their
bodies
de
quincey
taking
him
to
task
for
this
remark
declared
it
a
proof
of
blunted
sensibility
due
to
long
residence
in
italy
and
whether
the
particular
explanation
held
good
or
not
as
regards
the
question
at
issue
de
quincey
was
perfectly
right
it
is
very
good
to
be
with
respect
to
everything
that
reminds
us
of
the
animal
in
man
verbal
delicacy
in
itself
will
not
prove
an
advanced
civilization
but
civilization
as
it
advances
assuredly
tends
that
way
xxiii
all
through
the
morning
the
air
was
held
in
an
ominous
stillness
sitting
over
my
books
i
seemed
to
feel
the
silence
when
i
turned
my
look
to
the
window
i
saw
nothing
but
the
broad
grey
sky
a
featureless
expanse
cold
melancholy
later
just
as
i
was
bestirring
myself
to
go
out
for
an
afternoon
walk
something
white
fell
softly
across
my
vision
a
few
minutes
more
and
all
was
hidden
with
a
descending
veil
of
silent
snow
it
is
a
disappointment
yesterday
i
half
believed
that
the
winter
drew
to
its
end
the
breath
of
the
hills
was
soft
spaces
of
limpid
azure
shone
amid
clouds
and
seemed
the
promise
of
spring
idle
by
the
fireside
in
the
gathering
dusk
i
began
to
long
for
the
days
of
light
and
warmth
my
fancy
wandered
leading
me
far
and
wide
in
a
dream
of
summer
england
this
is
the
valley
of
the
blythe
the
stream
ripples
and
glances
over
its
brown
bed
warmed
with
sunbeams
by
its
bank
the
green
flags
wave
and
rustle
and
all
about
the
meadows
shine
in
pure
gold
of
buttercups
the
hawthorn
hedges
are
a
mass
of
gleaming
blossom
which
scents
the
breeze
there
above
rises
the
heath
with
gorse
and
beyond
if
i
walk
for
an
hour
or
two
i
shall
come
out
upon
the
sandy
cliffs
of
suffolk
and
look
over
the
northern
sea
i
am
in
wensleydale
climbing
from
the
rocky
river
that
leaps
amid
broad
pastures
up
to
the
rolling
moor
up
and
up
till
my
feet
brush
through
heather
and
the
grouse
whirrs
away
before
me
under
a
glowing
sky
of
summer
this
air
of
the
uplands
has
still
a
life
which
spurs
to
movement
which
makes
the
heart
bound
the
dale
is
hidden
i
see
only
the
brown
and
purple
wilderness
cutting
against
the
blue
with
great
round
shoulders
and
far
away
to
the
west
an
horizon
of
sombre
heights
i
ramble
through
a
village
in
gloucestershire
a
village
which
seems
forsaken
in
this
drowsy
warmth
of
the
afternoon
the
houses
of
grey
stone
are
old
and
beautiful
telling
of
a
time
when
englishmen
knew
how
to
build
whether
for
rich
or
poor
the
gardens
glow
with
flowers
and
the
air
is
delicately
sweet
at
the
village
end
i
come
into
a
lane
which
winds
upwards
between
grassy
slopes
to
turf
and
bracken
and
woods
of
noble
beech
here
i
am
upon
a
spur
of
the
cotswolds
and
before
me
spreads
the
wide
vale
of
evesham
with
its
ripening
crops
its
fruiting
orchards
watered
by
sacred
avon
beyond
softly
blue
the
hills
of
malvern
on
the
branch
hard
by
warbles
a
little
bird
glad
in
his
leafy
solitude
a
rabbit
jumps
through
the
fern
there
sounds
the
laugh
of
a
woodpecker
from
the
copse
in
yonder
hollow
in
the
falling
of
a
summer
night
i
walk
by
ullswater
the
sky
is
still
warm
with
the
afterglow
of
sunset
a
dusky
crimson
smouldering
above
the
dark
mountain
line
below
me
spreads
a
long
reach
of
the
lake
grey
between
its
dim
colourless
shores
in
the
profound
stillness
the
trotting
of
a
horse
beyond
the
water
sounds
strangely
near
it
serves
only
to
make
more
sensible
the
repose
of
nature
in
this
her
sanctuary
i
feel
a
solitude
unutterable
yet
nothing
akin
to
desolation
the
heart
of
the
land
i
love
seems
to
beat
in
the
silent
night
gathering
around
me
amid
things
eternal
i
touch
the
familiar
and
the
kindly
earth
moving
i
step
softly
as
though
my
footfall
were
an
irreverence
a
turn
in
the
road
and
there
is
wafted
to
me
a
faint
perfume
that
of
then
i
see
a
light
glimmering
in
the
farmhouse
window
a
little
ray
against
the
blackness
of
the
great
hillside
below
which
the
water
sleeps
a
pathway
leads
me
by
the
winding
of
the
river
ouse
far
on
every
side
stretches
a
homely
landscape
tilth
and
pasture
hedgerow
and
clustered
trees
to
where
the
sky
rests
upon
the
gentle
hills
slow
silent
the
river
lapses
between
its
daisied
banks
its
osier
beds
yonder
is
the
little
town
of
neots
in
all
england
no
simpler
bit
of
rural
scenery
in
all
the
world
nothing
of
its
kind
more
beautiful
cattle
are
lowing
amid
the
rich
meadows
here
one
may
loiter
and
dream
in
utter
restfulness
whilst
the
great
white
clouds
mirror
themselves
in
the
water
as
they
pass
above
i
am
walking
upon
the
south
downs
in
the
valleys
the
sun
lies
hot
but
here
sings
a
breeze
which
freshens
the
forehead
and
fills
the
heart
with
gladness
my
foot
upon
the
short
soft
turf
has
an
unwearied
lightness
i
feel
capable
of
walking
on
and
on
even
to
that
farthest
horizon
where
the
white
cloud
casts
its
floating
shadow
below
me
but
far
off
is
the
summer
sea
still
silent
its
blue
and
green
dimmed
at
the
long
limit
with
luminous
noontide
mist
inland
spreads
the
undulant
vastness
of
the
downs
beyond
them
the
tillage
and
the
woods
of
sussex
weald
coloured
like
to
the
pure
sky
above
them
but
in
deeper
tint
near
by
all
but
hidden
among
trees
in
yon
lovely
hollow
lies
an
old
old
hamlet
its
brown
roofs
decked
with
golden
lichen
i
see
the
low
and
the
little
graveyard
about
it
meanwhile
high
in
the
heaven
a
lark
is
singing
it
descends
it
drops
to
its
nest
and
i
could
dream
that
half
the
happiness
of
its
exultant
song
was
love
of
england
it
is
all
but
dark
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
must
have
been
writing
by
a
glow
of
firelight
reflected
on
to
my
desk
it
seemed
to
me
the
sun
of
summer
snow
is
still
falling
i
see
its
ghostly
glimmer
against
the
vanishing
sky
it
will
be
thick
upon
my
garden
and
perchance
for
several
days
but
when
it
melts
when
it
melts
it
will
leave
the
snowdrop
the
crocus
too
is
waiting
down
there
under
the
white
mantle
which
warms
the
earth
xxiv
time
is
money
says
the
vulgarest
saw
known
to
any
age
or
people
turn
it
round
about
and
you
get
a
precious
truth
money
is
time
i
think
of
it
on
these
dark
mornings
as
i
come
down
to
find
a
glorious
fire
crackling
and
leaping
in
my
study
suppose
i
were
so
poor
that
i
could
not
afford
that
heartsome
blaze
how
different
the
whole
day
would
be
have
i
not
lost
many
and
many
a
day
of
my
life
for
lack
of
the
material
comfort
which
was
necessary
to
put
my
mind
in
tune
money
is
time
with
money
i
buy
for
cheerful
use
the
hours
which
otherwise
would
not
in
any
sense
be
mine
nay
which
would
make
me
their
miserable
bondsman
money
is
time
and
heaven
be
thanked
there
needs
so
little
of
it
for
this
sort
of
purchase
he
who
has
overmuch
is
wont
to
be
as
badly
off
in
regard
to
the
true
use
of
money
as
he
who
has
not
enough
what
are
we
doing
all
our
lives
but
purchasing
or
trying
to
purchase
time
and
most
of
us
having
grasped
it
with
one
hand
throw
it
away
with
the
other
xxv
the
dark
days
are
drawing
to
an
end
soon
it
will
be
spring
once
more
i
shall
go
out
into
the
fields
and
shake
away
these
thoughts
of
discouragement
and
fear
which
have
lately
too
much
haunted
my
fireside
for
me
it
is
a
virtue
to
be
i
am
much
better
employed
from
every
point
of
view
when
i
live
solely
for
my
own
satisfaction
than
when
i
begin
to
worry
about
the
world
the
world
frightens
me
and
a
frightened
man
is
no
good
for
anything
i
know
only
one
way
in
which
i
could
have
played
a
meritorious
part
as
an
active
citizen
by
becoming
a
schoolmaster
in
some
little
country
town
and
teaching
half
a
dozen
teachable
boys
to
love
study
for
its
own
sake
that
i
could
have
done
i
daresay
yet
no
for
i
must
have
had
as
a
young
man
the
same
mind
that
i
have
in
age
devoid
of
idle
ambitions
undisturbed
by
unattainable
ideals
living
as
i
do
now
i
deserve
better
of
my
country
than
at
any
time
in
my
working
life
better
i
suspect
than
most
of
those
who
are
praised
for
busy
patriotism
not
that
i
regard
my
life
as
an
example
for
any
one
else
all
i
say
is
that
it
is
good
for
me
and
in
so
far
an
advantage
to
the
world
to
live
in
quiet
content
is
surely
a
piece
of
good
citizenship
if
you
can
do
more
do
it
and
i
know
myself
for
an
exception
and
i
ever
find
it
a
good
antidote
to
gloomy
thoughts
to
bring
before
my
imagination
the
lives
of
men
utterly
unlike
me
in
their
minds
and
circumstances
who
give
themselves
with
glad
and
hopeful
energy
to
the
plain
duties
that
lie
before
them
however
one
heart
may
fail
in
thinking
of
the
folly
and
baseness
which
make
so
great
a
part
of
world
remember
how
many
bright
souls
are
living
courageously
seeing
the
good
wherever
it
may
be
discovered
undismayed
by
portents
doing
what
they
have
to
do
with
all
their
strength
in
every
land
there
are
such
no
few
of
them
a
great
brotherhood
without
distinction
of
race
or
faith
for
they
indeed
constitute
the
race
of
man
rightly
designated
and
their
faith
is
one
the
cult
of
reason
and
of
justice
whether
the
future
is
to
them
or
to
the
talking
anthropoid
no
one
can
say
but
they
live
and
labour
guarding
the
fire
of
sacred
hope
in
my
own
country
dare
i
think
that
they
are
fewer
than
of
old
some
i
have
known
they
give
me
assurance
of
the
many
near
and
far
hearts
of
noble
strain
intrepid
generous
the
clear
head
the
keen
eye
a
spirit
equal
alike
to
good
fortune
and
to
ill
i
see
the
son
of
england
his
vigour
and
his
virtues
yet
unimpaired
in
his
blood
is
the
instinct
of
honour
the
scorn
of
meanness
he
can
not
suffer
his
word
to
be
doubted
and
his
hand
will
give
away
all
he
has
rather
than
profit
by
a
plebeian
parsimony
he
is
frugal
only
of
needless
speech
a
friend
staunch
to
the
death
tender
with
a
grave
sweetness
to
those
who
claim
his
love
passionate
beneath
stoic
seeming
for
the
causes
he
holds
sacred
a
hater
of
confusion
and
of
idle
noise
his
place
is
not
where
the
mob
presses
he
makes
no
vaunt
of
what
he
has
done
no
boastful
promise
of
what
he
will
do
when
the
insensate
cry
is
loud
the
counsel
of
wisdom
overborne
he
will
hold
apart
content
with
plain
work
that
lies
nearest
to
his
hand
building
strengthening
whilst
others
riot
in
destruction
he
was
ever
hopeful
and
deems
it
a
crime
to
despair
of
his
country
non
si
male
nunc
et
olim
sic
erit
fallen
on
whatever
evil
days
and
evil
tongues
he
remembers
that
englishman
of
old
who
under
every
menace
bore
right
onwards
and
like
him
if
so
it
must
be
can
make
it
his
duty
and
his
service
to
stand
and
wait
xxvi
impatient
for
the
light
of
spring
i
have
slept
lately
with
my
blind
drawn
up
so
that
at
waking
i
have
the
sky
in
view
this
morning
i
awoke
just
before
sunrise
the
air
was
still
a
faint
flush
of
rose
to
westward
told
me
that
the
east
made
fair
promise
i
could
see
no
cloud
and
there
before
me
dropping
to
the
horizon
glistened
the
horned
moon
the
promise
held
good
after
breakfast
i
could
not
sit
down
by
the
fireside
indeed
a
fire
was
scarce
necessary
the
sun
drew
me
forth
and
i
walked
all
the
morning
about
the
moist
lanes
delighting
myself
with
the
scent
of
earth
on
my
way
home
i
saw
the
first
celandine
so
once
more
the
year
has
come
full
circle
and
how
quickly
alas
how
quickly
can
it
be
a
whole
twelvemonth
since
the
last
spring
because
i
am
so
content
with
life
must
life
slip
away
as
though
it
grudged
me
my
happiness
time
was
when
a
year
drew
its
slow
length
of
toil
and
anxiety
and
ever
frustrate
waiting
further
away
the
year
of
childhood
seemed
endless
it
is
familiarity
with
life
that
makes
time
speed
quickly
when
every
day
is
a
step
in
the
unknown
as
for
children
the
days
are
long
with
gathering
of
experience
the
week
gone
by
is
already
far
in
retrospect
of
things
learnt
and
that
to
come
especially
if
it
foretell
some
joy
lingers
in
remoteness
past
one
learns
little
and
expects
little
is
like
unto
yesterday
and
to
that
which
shall
be
the
morrow
only
torment
of
mind
or
body
serves
to
delay
the
indistinguishable
hours
enjoy
the
day
and
behold
it
shrinks
to
a
moment
i
could
wish
for
many
another
year
yet
if
i
knew
that
not
one
more
awaited
me
i
should
not
grumble
when
i
was
ill
at
ease
in
the
world
it
would
have
been
hard
to
die
i
had
lived
to
no
purpose
that
i
could
discover
the
end
would
have
seemed
abrupt
and
meaningless
now
my
life
is
rounded
it
began
with
the
natural
irreflective
happiness
of
childhood
it
will
close
in
the
reasoned
tranquillity
of
the
mature
mind
how
many
a
time
after
long
labour
on
some
piece
of
writing
brought
at
length
to
its
conclusion
have
i
laid
down
the
pen
with
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
the
work
was
full
of
faults
but
i
had
wrought
sincerely
had
done
what
time
and
circumstance
and
my
own
nature
permitted
even
so
may
it
be
with
me
in
my
last
hour
may
i
look
back
on
life
as
a
long
task
duly
completed
a
piece
of
biography
faulty
enough
but
good
as
i
could
make
it
and
with
no
thought
but
one
of
contentment
welcome
the
repose
to
follow
when
i
have
breathed
the
word
finis
