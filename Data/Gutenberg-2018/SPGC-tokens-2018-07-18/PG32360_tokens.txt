i
speak
from
bitter
experience
because
on
the
first
expedition
to
mars
hugh
allenby
damned
near
drove
us
nuts
with
his
puns
we
finally
got
so
we
just
ignored
them
but
no
one
can
ignore
that
classic
last
one
it
written
right
into
the
annals
of
astronomy
and
it
there
to
stay
allenby
in
command
of
the
expedition
was
first
to
set
foot
outside
the
ship
as
he
stepped
down
from
the
airlock
of
the
he
placed
that
foot
on
a
convenient
rock
caught
the
toe
of
his
weighted
boot
in
a
hole
in
the
rock
wrenched
his
ankle
and
smote
the
ground
with
his
pants
sitting
there
eyes
pained
behind
the
transparent
shield
of
his
he
stared
at
the
rock
it
was
about
five
feet
high
ordinary
granite
no
special
shape
and
several
inches
below
its
summit
running
straight
through
it
in
a
northeasterly
direction
was
a
neat
round
hole
i
by
the
thing
he
grunted
the
rest
of
us
scrambled
out
of
the
ship
and
gathered
around
his
plump
form
only
one
or
two
of
us
winced
at
his
miserable
double
pun
break
anything
hugh
asked
burton
our
pilot
kneeling
beside
him
get
out
of
my
way
burton
said
allenby
you
obstructing
my
view
burton
blinked
a
man
constructed
of
long
bones
and
caution
he
angled
out
of
the
way
looking
around
to
see
what
he
was
obstructing
view
he
saw
the
rock
and
the
round
hole
through
it
he
stood
very
still
staring
so
did
the
rest
of
us
well
i
be
damned
said
janus
our
photographer
a
hole
in
a
rock
added
gonzales
our
botanist
round
said
randolph
our
biologist
an
finished
allenby
softly
burton
helped
him
to
his
feet
silently
we
gathered
around
the
rock
janus
bent
down
and
put
an
eye
to
one
end
of
the
hole
i
bent
down
and
looked
through
the
other
end
we
squinted
at
each
other
as
mineralogist
i
was
expected
to
opinionate
not
drilled
i
said
slowly
not
chipped
not
melted
certainly
not
eroded
i
heard
a
rasping
sound
by
my
ear
and
straightened
burton
was
scratching
a
thumbnail
along
the
rim
of
the
hole
weathered
he
said
plenty
old
but
i
bet
it
a
perfect
circle
if
we
measure
janus
was
already
fiddling
with
his
camera
testing
the
cooperation
of
the
tiny
distant
sun
with
a
let
us
see
it
is
or
not
allenby
said
burton
brought
out
a
steel
the
hole
was
four
and
inches
across
it
was
perfectly
circular
and
about
sixteen
inches
long
and
four
feet
above
the
ground
but
why
said
randolph
why
should
anyone
bore
a
tunnel
through
a
rock
way
out
in
the
middle
of
the
desert
religious
symbol
said
janus
he
looked
around
one
hand
on
his
gun
we
better
keep
an
eye
out
maybe
we
landed
on
sacred
ground
or
something
a
totem
perhaps
allenby
suggested
oh
i
do
know
randolph
said
to
janus
not
allenby
as
mentioned
we
always
ignored
allenby
puns
note
the
lack
of
ornamentation
not
at
all
typical
of
religious
articles
on
earth
gonzales
reminded
him
besides
it
might
be
utilitarian
not
symbolic
utilitarian
how
asked
janus
an
altar
for
snakes
burton
said
dryly
well
said
allenby
you
ca
deny
that
it
has
its
aspects
get
your
hand
away
will
you
peters
asked
janus
i
did
when
janus
camera
had
clicked
i
bent
again
and
peered
through
the
hole
it
sights
on
that
low
ridge
over
there
i
said
maybe
some
kind
of
surveying
setup
i
going
to
take
a
look
careful
warned
janus
remember
it
may
be
sacred
as
i
walked
away
i
heard
allenby
say
take
some
scrapings
from
the
inside
of
the
hole
gonzales
we
might
be
able
to
determine
if
anything
is
kept
in
it
one
of
the
stumpy
purplish
cacti
on
the
ridge
had
a
long
vertical
bite
out
of
it
as
if
someone
had
carefully
carved
out
a
narrow
section
from
the
top
down
finishing
the
bottom
of
the
u
in
a
neat
semicircle
it
was
as
flat
and
cleancut
as
the
inside
surface
of
a
horseshoe
magnet
i
hollered
the
others
came
running
i
pointed
oh
my
god
said
allenby
another
one
the
pulp
of
the
cactus
in
and
around
the
was
dried
and
silently
burton
used
his
the
hole
measured
four
and
inches
across
it
was
eleven
inches
deep
the
semicircular
bottom
was
about
a
foot
above
the
ground
this
ridge
i
said
is
about
three
feet
higher
than
where
we
landed
the
ship
i
bet
the
hole
in
the
rock
and
the
hole
in
this
cactus
are
on
the
same
level
gonzales
said
slowly
this
was
not
done
all
at
once
it
is
a
result
of
periodic
attacks
look
here
and
here
these
overlapping
depressions
along
the
outer
edges
of
the
hole
he
pointed
on
this
side
of
the
cactus
they
are
the
signs
of
repeated
impact
and
the
scallop
effect
on
side
where
whatever
made
the
hole
emerged
there
are
juices
still
oozing
not
at
the
point
of
impact
where
the
plant
is
desiccated
but
below
where
the
shock
was
transmitted
a
distant
shout
turned
us
around
burton
was
at
the
rock
beside
the
ship
he
was
bending
down
his
eye
to
the
far
side
of
the
mysterious
hole
he
looked
for
another
second
then
straightened
and
came
toward
us
at
a
lope
they
line
up
he
said
when
he
reached
us
the
bottom
of
the
hole
in
the
cactus
is
right
in
the
middle
when
you
sight
through
the
hole
in
the
rock
as
if
somebody
came
around
and
whacked
the
cactus
regularly
janus
said
looking
around
warily
illustration
to
keep
the
line
of
sight
through
the
holes
clear
i
wondered
why
not
just
remove
the
cactus
religious
janus
explained
the
gauntlet
he
had
discarded
lay
ignored
on
the
ground
in
the
shadow
of
the
cactus
we
went
on
past
the
ridge
toward
an
outcropping
of
rock
about
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
we
walked
silently
each
of
us
wondering
if
what
we
would
really
be
there
it
was
in
one
of
the
tall
weathered
spires
in
the
outcropping
some
ten
feet
below
its
peak
and
four
feet
above
the
ground
was
a
round
hole
allenby
sat
down
on
a
rock
nursing
his
ankle
and
remarked
that
anybody
who
believed
this
crazy
business
was
really
happening
must
have
holes
in
the
rocks
in
his
head
illustration
burton
put
his
eye
to
the
hole
and
whistled
sixty
feet
long
if
an
inch
he
said
the
other
end
just
a
pinpoint
but
you
can
see
it
the
damn
thing
perfectly
straight
i
looked
back
the
way
we
had
come
the
cactus
stood
on
the
ridge
with
its
bite
and
beyond
was
the
ship
and
beside
it
the
perforated
rock
if
we
surveyed
i
said
i
bet
the
holes
would
all
line
up
right
to
the
last
millimeter
but
randolph
complained
why
would
anybody
go
out
and
bore
holes
in
things
all
along
a
line
through
the
desert
religious
janus
muttered
it
does
to
make
sense
we
stood
there
by
the
outcropping
and
looked
out
along
the
wide
red
desert
beyond
it
stretched
flatly
for
miles
from
this
point
south
toward
mars
equator
dead
sandy
wastes
crisscrossed
by
the
canals
which
we
had
observed
while
landing
to
be
great
straggly
patches
of
vegetation
probably
strung
along
underground
waterflows
we
jumped
half
out
of
our
skins
ozone
bit
at
our
nostrils
our
hair
stirred
in
the
electrical
uproar
janus
chattered
lowering
his
smoking
gun
about
forty
feet
to
our
left
a
small
rabbity
creature
poked
its
head
from
behind
a
rock
and
stared
at
us
in
utter
horror
janus
raised
his
gun
again
do
bother
said
allenby
tiredly
i
do
think
it
intends
to
attack
but
i
sure
it
is
a
martian
with
religious
convictions
janus
wet
his
lips
and
looked
a
little
shamefaced
i
guess
i
kind
of
taut
that
what
i
said
allenby
the
creature
darted
from
behind
its
rock
and
looking
at
us
over
its
shoulder
employed
six
legs
to
make
small
but
very
fast
tracks
we
turned
our
attention
again
to
the
desert
far
out
black
against
mars
azure
horizon
was
a
line
of
low
hills
shall
we
go
look
asked
burton
eyes
gleaming
at
the
mystery
janus
hefted
his
gun
nervously
it
was
still
crackling
faintly
from
the
discharge
i
say
let
get
back
to
the
ship
allenby
sighed
my
leg
hurts
he
studied
the
hills
give
me
the
randolph
handed
them
over
allenby
put
them
to
the
shield
of
his
mask
and
adjusted
them
after
a
moment
he
sighed
again
there
a
hole
on
a
plane
surface
that
catches
the
sun
a
lousy
damned
round
little
impossible
hole
those
hills
burton
observed
must
be
thousands
of
feet
thick
the
argument
lasted
all
the
way
back
to
the
ship
janus
holding
out
for
his
belief
that
the
whole
thing
was
of
religious
origin
kept
looking
around
for
martians
as
if
he
expected
them
to
pour
screaming
from
the
hills
burton
came
up
with
the
suggestion
that
perhaps
the
holes
had
been
made
by
a
it
possible
allenby
admitted
this
might
have
been
the
scene
of
some
great
battle
with
only
one
such
weapon
i
objected
allenby
swore
as
he
stumbled
what
do
you
mean
i
have
seen
any
other
lines
of
holes
only
the
one
in
a
battle
the
whole
joint
should
be
cut
up
that
was
good
for
a
few
moments
silent
thought
then
allenby
said
it
might
have
been
brought
out
by
one
side
as
a
last
resort
sort
of
an
ace
in
the
hole
i
resisted
the
temptation
to
mutiny
but
would
even
one
such
weapon
in
battle
make
only
line
of
holes
would
it
be
played
in
an
arc
against
the
enemy
you
know
it
would
well
would
it
cut
slices
out
of
the
landscape
instead
of
boring
holes
and
would
it
sway
or
vibrate
enough
to
make
the
holes
miles
away
from
it
something
less
than
perfect
circles
it
could
have
been
very
firmly
mounted
hugh
does
that
sound
like
a
practical
weapon
to
you
two
seconds
of
silence
on
the
other
hand
he
said
instead
of
a
war
the
whole
thing
might
have
been
designed
to
frighten
some
primitive
race
or
even
some
kind
of
beast
the
out
of
here
a
demonstration
religious
janus
grumbled
still
looking
around
we
walked
on
passing
the
cactus
on
the
low
ridge
interesting
said
gonzales
the
evidence
that
whatever
causes
the
phenomenon
has
happened
again
and
again
i
afraid
that
the
war
theory
oh
my
god
gasped
burton
we
stared
at
him
the
ship
he
whispered
it
right
in
line
with
the
holes
if
whatever
made
them
is
still
in
operation
run
yelled
allenby
and
we
ran
like
fiends
we
got
the
ship
into
the
air
out
of
line
with
the
holes
to
what
we
fervently
hoped
was
safety
and
then
we
realized
we
were
admitting
our
fear
that
the
mysterious
might
still
be
lurking
around
well
the
evidence
was
all
for
it
as
gonzales
had
reminded
us
that
cactus
had
been
oozing
we
cruised
at
twenty
thousand
feet
and
thought
it
over
janus
whose
only
training
was
in
photography
said
some
kind
of
omnivorous
animal
or
bird
eats
rocks
and
everything
i
will
not
totally
discount
the
notion
of
such
an
animal
randolph
said
but
i
will
resist
to
the
death
the
suggestion
that
it
forages
with
geometric
precision
after
a
while
allenby
said
land
burton
by
that
lots
of
plant
life
fauna
too
we
do
a
little
collecting
burton
set
us
down
at
the
very
edge
of
the
sprawling
flat
expanse
of
vegetation
commenting
that
the
scene
reminded
him
of
his
native
texas
we
wandered
in
the
chilly
air
each
of
us
except
burton
pursuing
his
specialty
randolph
relentlessly
stalked
another
of
the
rabbity
creatures
gonzales
was
carefully
digging
up
plants
and
stowing
them
in
jars
janus
was
busy
with
his
cameras
recording
every
aspect
of
mars
transferable
to
film
allenby
walked
around
helping
anybody
who
needed
it
an
astronomer
he
done
half
his
work
on
the
way
to
mars
and
would
do
the
other
half
on
the
return
trip
burton
lounged
in
the
sun
his
back
against
a
ship
fin
and
played
chess
with
allenby
who
was
calling
out
his
moves
in
a
bull
roar
i
grubbed
for
rocks
my
search
took
me
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
others
all
i
could
find
around
the
was
gravel
and
i
wanted
to
chip
at
some
big
stuff
i
walked
toward
a
long
rise
a
or
so
away
beyond
which
rose
an
enticing
array
of
boulders
as
i
moved
out
of
earshot
i
heard
randolph
snarl
burton
you
stop
yelling
to
and
check
every
time
you
open
your
yap
this
critter
takes
off
on
me
then
i
saw
the
groove
it
started
right
where
the
ground
began
to
rise
a
thin
shallow
groove
in
the
dirt
at
my
feet
about
half
an
inch
across
running
off
straight
toward
higher
ground
with
my
eyes
glued
to
it
i
walked
the
ground
slowly
rose
the
groove
deepened
widened
now
it
was
about
three
inches
across
about
one
and
a
half
deep
i
walked
on
holding
my
breath
four
inches
wide
two
inches
deep
the
ground
rose
some
more
four
and
inches
wide
i
have
to
measure
it
i
now
as
the
ground
rose
the
edges
of
the
groove
began
to
curve
inward
over
the
groove
they
touched
no
more
groove
the
ground
had
risen
the
groove
had
stayed
level
and
gone
underground
except
that
now
it
was
a
groove
it
was
a
round
tunnel
a
hole
a
few
paces
farther
on
i
thumped
the
ground
with
my
heel
where
the
hole
ought
to
be
the
dirt
crumbled
and
there
was
the
little
dark
tunnel
running
straight
in
both
directions
i
walked
on
the
ground
falling
away
gradually
again
the
entire
process
was
repeated
in
reverse
a
hairline
appeared
in
the
dirt
widened
became
lips
that
drew
slowly
apart
to
reveal
the
neat
straight
groove
which
shrank
as
slowly
to
a
shallow
line
of
the
ground
and
vanished
i
looked
ahead
of
me
there
was
one
low
ridge
of
ground
between
me
and
the
enormous
boulders
a
neat
semicircle
was
bitten
out
of
the
very
top
of
the
ridge
in
the
boulder
directly
beyond
was
a
hole
allenby
winced
and
called
the
others
when
i
came
back
and
reported
the
mystery
he
told
them
he
turned
to
me
lead
on
peters
you
temporary
leader
thank
god
he
did
say
the
holes
went
straight
through
the
nest
of
boulders
there
be
a
hole
in
one
and
ten
or
twenty
feet
farther
on
in
the
next
boulder
another
hole
and
then
another
and
another
right
through
the
nest
in
a
line
about
thirty
holes
in
all
burton
standing
by
the
boulder
i
first
seen
flashed
his
flashlight
into
the
hole
randolph
clear
on
the
other
side
of
the
jumbled
nest
eye
to
hole
saw
it
straight
as
a
string
the
ground
sloped
away
on
the
far
side
of
the
nest
no
holes
were
visible
in
that
direction
just
miles
of
desert
so
after
we
stared
at
the
holes
for
a
while
and
they
did
go
away
we
headed
back
for
the
canal
is
there
any
possibility
asked
janus
as
we
walked
that
it
could
be
a
natural
phenomenon
there
are
no
straight
lines
in
nature
randolph
said
a
little
shortly
that
goes
for
a
bunch
of
circles
in
a
straight
line
and
for
perfect
circles
too
a
planet
is
a
circle
objected
janus
an
oblate
spheroid
allenby
corrected
a
planet
orbit
an
ellipse
janus
walked
a
few
steps
frowning
then
he
said
i
remember
reading
that
there
something
darned
near
a
perfect
circle
in
nature
he
paused
a
moment
potholes
and
he
looked
at
me
as
mineralogist
to
corroborate
what
kind
of
potholes
i
asked
cautiously
do
you
mean
where
part
of
a
limestone
deposit
has
dissol
no
i
once
read
that
when
a
glacier
passes
over
a
hard
rock
lying
on
some
softer
rock
it
grinds
the
hard
rock
down
into
the
softer
and
both
of
them
sort
of
wear
down
to
fit
together
and
it
all
ends
up
with
a
round
hole
in
the
soft
rock
probably
neither
stone
i
told
janus
would
be
homogenous
the
softer
parts
would
abrade
faster
in
the
soft
stone
the
end
result
would
be
a
perfect
circle
janus
face
fell
now
i
said
would
anyone
care
to
define
this
term
we
throwing
around
so
blithely
because
such
holes
as
janus
describes
are
often
pretty
damned
round
randolph
said
well
it
is
settled
then
gonzales
said
a
little
sarcastically
your
discussion
gentlemen
has
established
that
the
long
horizontal
holes
we
have
found
were
caused
by
glacial
action
oh
no
janus
argued
seriously
i
once
read
that
mars
never
had
any
glaciers
all
of
us
shuddered
half
an
hour
later
we
spotted
more
holes
about
a
mile
down
the
still
on
a
line
marching
along
the
desert
through
cacti
rocks
hills
even
through
one
edge
of
the
low
vegetation
of
the
for
thirty
feet
or
so
it
was
the
damnedest
thing
to
bend
down
and
look
straight
through
all
that
curling
twisting
growth
a
round
tunnel
from
either
end
we
followed
the
holes
for
about
a
mile
to
the
rim
of
an
enormous
saucerlike
valley
that
sank
gradually
before
us
until
miles
away
it
was
thousands
of
feet
deep
we
stared
out
across
it
wondering
about
the
other
side
allenby
said
determinedly
we
burrow
to
the
of
these
holes
once
and
for
all
back
to
the
ship
men
we
hiked
back
climbed
in
and
took
off
at
an
altitude
of
fifty
feet
burton
lined
the
nose
of
the
ship
on
the
most
recent
line
of
holes
and
we
flew
out
over
the
valley
on
the
other
side
was
a
range
of
hefty
hills
the
holes
went
through
them
straight
through
we
would
approach
one
hill
burton
would
manipulate
the
front
viewscreen
until
we
spotted
the
hole
we
would
pass
over
the
hill
and
spot
the
other
end
of
the
hole
in
the
rear
screen
one
hole
was
two
hundred
and
eighty
miles
long
four
hours
later
we
were
halfway
around
mars
randolph
was
sitting
by
a
side
port
chin
on
one
hand
his
eyes
unbelieving
all
around
the
planet
he
kept
repeating
all
around
the
planet
halfway
at
least
allenby
mused
and
we
can
assume
that
it
continues
in
a
straight
line
through
anything
and
everything
that
gets
in
its
way
he
gazed
out
the
front
port
at
the
uneven
haze
of
a
off
to
our
left
for
the
love
of
heaven
why
then
allenby
fell
down
we
all
did
burton
had
suddenly
slapped
at
the
control
board
and
the
ship
braked
and
sank
like
a
plugged
duck
at
the
last
second
burton
propped
up
the
nose
with
a
short
burst
the
wheels
hit
desert
sand
and
in
five
hundred
yards
we
had
jounced
to
a
stop
allenby
got
up
from
the
floor
why
did
you
do
that
he
asked
burton
politely
nursing
a
bruised
elbow
burton
nose
was
almost
touching
the
front
port
look
he
said
and
pointed
about
two
miles
away
the
martian
village
looked
like
a
handful
of
yellow
marbles
flung
on
the
desert
we
checked
our
guns
we
put
on
our
we
checked
our
guns
again
we
got
out
of
the
ship
and
made
damned
sure
the
airlock
was
locked
an
hour
later
we
crawled
inch
by
painstaking
inch
up
a
high
sand
dune
and
poked
our
heads
over
the
top
the
martians
were
runts
the
tallest
of
them
less
than
five
feet
tall
and
skinny
as
a
pencil
and
brown
they
wore
loincloths
of
woven
fiber
they
stood
among
the
buildings
of
their
village
and
every
one
of
them
was
looking
straight
up
at
us
with
unblinking
brown
eyes
the
six
safeties
of
our
six
guns
clicked
off
like
a
rattle
of
dice
the
martians
stood
there
and
gawped
probably
a
highly
developed
sense
of
hearing
in
this
thin
atmosphere
allenby
murmured
heard
us
coming
they
thought
that
landing
of
burton
was
an
earthquake
randolph
grumbled
sourly
marsquake
corrected
janus
one
look
at
the
village
scrawny
occupants
seemed
to
have
convinced
him
that
his
life
was
in
no
danger
holding
the
martians
covered
we
examined
the
village
from
atop
the
dune
the
domelike
buildings
were
constructed
of
something
that
looked
like
adobe
no
windows
probably
built
with
sandstorms
in
mind
the
doors
were
about
halfway
up
the
sloping
sides
and
from
each
door
a
stone
ramp
wound
down
around
the
house
to
the
ground
again
with
sandstorms
in
mind
no
doubt
so
drifting
dunes
would
block
the
entrances
the
center
of
the
village
was
a
wide
street
a
long
sandy
area
some
thirty
feet
wide
on
either
side
of
it
the
houses
were
scattered
at
random
as
if
each
martian
had
simply
hunted
for
a
comfortable
place
to
sit
and
then
built
a
house
around
it
look
whispered
randolph
one
martian
had
stepped
from
a
group
situated
on
the
far
side
of
the
street
from
us
he
started
to
cross
the
street
his
round
brown
eyes
on
us
his
small
bare
feet
plodding
sand
and
we
saw
that
in
addition
to
a
loincloth
he
wore
jewelry
a
hammered
metal
ring
a
bracelet
on
one
skinny
ankle
the
sun
caught
a
copperish
gleam
on
his
bald
narrow
head
and
we
saw
a
band
of
metal
there
just
above
where
his
eyebrows
should
have
been
the
allenby
murmured
oh
me
as
the
bejeweled
martian
approached
the
center
of
the
street
he
glanced
briefly
at
the
ground
at
his
feet
then
he
raised
his
head
stepped
with
dignity
across
the
exact
center
of
the
street
and
came
on
toward
us
passing
the
buildings
of
his
realm
and
the
groups
of
his
subjects
he
reached
the
slope
of
the
dune
we
lay
on
paused
and
raised
small
hands
over
his
head
palms
toward
us
i
think
allenby
said
that
an
anthropologist
would
give
odds
on
that
gesture
meaning
peace
he
stood
up
holstered
his
gun
without
buttoning
the
flap
and
raised
his
own
hands
over
his
head
we
all
did
the
martian
language
consisted
of
squeaks
we
made
friendly
noises
the
chief
squeaked
and
pretty
soon
we
were
the
center
of
a
group
of
martians
none
of
whom
made
a
sound
evidently
no
one
dared
peep
while
the
chief
spoke
very
likely
the
most
articulate
martians
simply
squeaked
themselves
into
the
job
allenby
of
course
said
they
just
he
was
going
through
the
business
of
drawing
concentric
circles
in
the
sand
pointing
at
the
third
orbit
away
from
the
sun
and
thumping
his
chest
the
crowd
around
us
kept
growing
as
more
martians
emerged
from
the
dome
buildings
to
see
what
was
going
on
down
the
winding
ramps
of
the
buildings
on
our
side
of
the
wide
sandy
street
they
came
and
from
the
buildings
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
plodding
through
the
sand
blinking
brown
eyes
at
us
not
making
a
sound
allenby
pointed
at
the
third
orbit
and
thumped
his
chest
the
chief
squeaked
and
thumped
his
own
chest
and
pointed
at
the
copperish
band
around
his
head
then
he
pointed
at
allenby
i
seem
to
have
conveyed
to
him
allenby
said
dryly
the
fact
that
chief
of
our
party
well
let
try
again
he
started
over
on
the
orbits
he
did
seem
to
be
getting
anyplace
so
the
rest
of
us
watched
the
martians
instead
a
last
handful
was
straggling
across
the
wide
street
curious
said
gonzales
note
what
happens
when
they
reach
the
center
of
the
street
each
martian
upon
reaching
the
center
of
the
street
glanced
at
his
feet
just
for
a
moment
without
even
breaking
stride
and
then
came
on
what
can
they
be
looking
at
gonzales
wondered
the
chief
did
it
too
burton
mused
remember
when
he
first
came
toward
us
we
all
stared
intently
at
the
middle
of
the
street
we
saw
absolutely
nothing
but
sand
the
martians
milled
around
us
and
watched
allenby
and
his
orbits
a
martian
child
appeared
from
between
two
buildings
across
the
street
on
legs
it
started
across
got
halfway
glanced
downward
and
came
on
i
do
get
it
burton
said
what
in
hell
are
they
at
the
child
reached
the
crowd
and
squeaked
a
thin
high
note
a
number
of
things
happened
at
once
several
members
of
the
group
around
us
glanced
down
and
along
the
edge
of
the
crowd
nearest
the
center
of
the
street
there
was
a
mild
stir
as
individuals
drifted
off
to
either
side
quite
casually
nothing
at
all
urgent
about
it
they
just
moved
concertedly
to
get
farther
away
from
the
center
of
the
street
not
taking
their
interested
gaze
off
us
for
one
second
in
the
process
even
the
chief
glanced
up
from
allenby
concentric
circles
at
the
child
squeak
and
randolph
who
had
been
fidgeting
uncomfortably
and
paying
very
little
attention
to
our
conversation
decided
that
he
must
answer
nature
call
he
moved
off
into
the
dunes
surrounding
the
village
or
rather
he
started
to
move
the
moment
he
set
off
across
the
wide
street
the
little
martian
chief
was
in
front
of
him
brown
eyes
wide
hands
out
before
him
as
if
to
thrust
randolph
back
again
six
safeties
clicked
the
martians
did
even
blink
at
the
sudden
appearance
of
our
guns
probably
the
only
weapon
they
recognized
was
a
club
or
maybe
a
rock
what
can
the
matter
be
randolph
said
he
took
another
step
forward
the
chief
squeaked
and
stood
his
ground
randolph
had
to
stop
or
bump
into
him
randolph
stopped
the
chief
squeaked
looking
right
into
the
bore
of
randolph
gun
hold
still
allenby
told
randolph
till
we
know
what
up
allenby
made
an
interrogative
sound
at
the
chief
the
chief
squeaked
and
pointed
at
the
ground
we
looked
he
was
pointing
at
his
shadow
randolph
stirred
uncomfortably
hold
still
allenby
warned
him
and
again
he
made
the
questioning
sound
the
chief
pointed
up
the
street
then
he
pointed
down
the
street
he
bent
to
touch
his
shadow
thumping
it
with
thin
fingers
then
he
pointed
at
the
wall
of
a
house
nearby
we
all
looked
straight
lines
had
been
painted
on
the
curved
wall
up
and
down
and
across
to
form
many
small
squares
about
four
inches
across
in
each
square
was
a
bit
of
squiggly
writing
in
blackish
paint
and
a
small
wooden
peg
jutting
out
from
the
wall
burton
said
looks
like
a
damn
crossword
puzzle
look
said
janus
in
the
lower
right
corner
a
metal
ring
hanging
from
one
of
the
pegs
and
that
was
all
we
saw
on
the
wall
hundreds
of
squares
with
figures
in
them
a
small
peg
set
in
each
and
a
ring
hanging
on
one
of
the
pegs
you
know
what
allenby
said
slowly
i
think
it
a
calendar
just
a
second
thirty
squares
wide
by
high
that
six
hundred
and
sixty
and
that
bottom
line
has
squares
six
hundred
and
squares
in
all
that
how
many
days
there
are
in
the
martian
year
he
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
metal
ring
i
bet
that
ring
is
hanging
from
the
peg
in
the
square
that
represents
they
must
move
it
along
every
day
to
keep
track
what
a
calendar
got
to
do
with
my
crossing
the
street
randolph
asked
in
a
pained
tone
he
started
to
take
another
step
the
chief
squeaked
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
desperate
concern
that
he
make
us
understand
randolph
stopped
again
and
swore
impatiently
allenby
made
his
questioning
sound
again
the
chief
pointed
emphatically
at
his
shadow
then
at
the
communal
calendar
and
we
could
see
now
that
he
was
pointing
at
the
metal
ring
burton
said
slowly
i
think
he
trying
to
tell
us
that
this
is
and
a
of
day
i
bet
he
using
his
shadow
as
a
sundial
perhaps
allenby
granted
randolph
said
if
this
monkey
does
let
me
go
in
another
minute
the
chief
squeaked
eyes
concerned
stand
still
allenby
ordered
he
trying
to
warn
you
of
some
danger
the
chief
pointed
down
the
street
again
and
instead
of
squealing
revealed
that
there
was
another
sound
at
his
command
he
said
whooooooosh
we
all
stared
at
the
end
of
the
street
nothing
just
the
wide
avenue
between
the
houses
and
the
high
sand
dune
down
at
the
end
of
it
from
which
we
had
first
looked
upon
the
village
the
chief
described
a
large
circle
with
one
hand
sweeping
the
hand
above
his
head
down
to
his
knees
up
again
as
fast
as
he
could
he
pursed
his
and
said
whooooooosh
and
made
the
circle
again
a
martian
emerged
from
the
door
in
the
side
of
a
house
across
the
avenue
and
blinked
at
the
sun
as
if
he
had
just
awakened
then
he
saw
what
was
going
on
below
and
blinked
again
this
time
in
interest
he
made
his
way
down
around
the
winding
lamp
and
started
to
cross
the
street
about
halfway
he
paused
eyed
the
calendar
on
the
house
wall
glanced
at
his
shadow
then
he
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
across
the
middle
of
the
street
once
past
the
middle
he
rose
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
to
join
one
of
the
groups
and
calmly
stared
at
us
along
with
the
rest
of
them
they
all
crazy
randolph
said
disgustedly
i
going
to
cross
that
street
shut
up
so
it
a
certain
time
of
a
certain
day
allenby
mused
and
from
the
way
the
chief
is
acting
he
afraid
for
you
to
cross
the
street
and
that
other
one
just
by
god
do
you
know
what
this
might
tie
in
with
we
were
silent
for
a
moment
then
gonzales
said
of
course
and
burton
said
the
exactly
said
allenby
maybe
whatever
made
or
makes
the
holes
comes
right
down
the
center
of
the
street
here
maybe
that
why
they
built
the
village
this
way
to
make
room
for
for
what
randolph
asked
unhappily
shifting
his
feet
i
do
know
allenby
said
he
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
chief
that
circular
motion
he
made
could
he
have
been
describing
something
that
went
around
and
around
the
planet
something
like
oh
no
eyes
glazed
i
would
believe
it
in
a
million
years
his
gaze
went
to
the
far
end
of
the
street
to
the
high
sand
dune
that
rose
there
the
chief
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
something
to
happen
i
going
to
crawl
randolph
stated
he
got
to
his
hands
and
knees
and
began
to
creep
across
the
center
of
the
avenue
the
chief
let
him
go
the
sand
dune
at
the
end
of
the
street
suddenly
erupted
a
spout
of
dust
shot
straight
out
from
the
sloping
side
as
if
a
bullet
had
emerged
powdered
sand
hazed
the
air
yellowed
it
almost
the
full
length
of
the
avenue
grains
of
sand
stung
the
skin
and
rattled
minutely
on
the
houses
whooossshhhhh
randolph
dropped
flat
on
his
belly
he
did
have
to
continue
his
trip
he
had
made
other
arrangements
that
night
in
the
ship
while
we
all
sat
around
still
shaking
our
heads
every
once
in
a
while
allenby
talked
with
earth
he
sat
there
wearing
the
headphones
trying
to
make
himself
understood
above
the
godawful
static
an
exceedingly
small
body
he
repeated
wearily
to
his
unbelieving
audience
about
four
inches
in
diameter
it
travels
at
a
mean
distance
of
four
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
planet
at
a
velocity
yet
to
be
calculated
its
unique
nature
results
in
many
hitherto
unobserved
i
might
say
even
unimagined
phenomena
he
stared
blankly
in
front
of
him
for
a
moment
then
delivered
the
understatement
of
his
life
the
discovery
may
necessitate
a
of
many
of
our
basic
postulates
in
the
physical
sciences
the
headphones
squawked
patiently
allenby
assured
earth
that
he
was
entirely
serious
and
reiterated
the
results
of
his
observations
i
suppose
that
he
an
astronomer
was
twice
as
flabbergasted
as
the
rest
of
us
on
the
other
hand
perhaps
he
was
better
equipped
to
adjust
to
the
evidence
evidently
he
said
when
the
body
was
formed
it
traveled
at
such
fantastic
velocity
as
to
enable
it
to
his
voice
was
almost
a
whisper
to
punch
holes
in
things
the
headphones
squawked
in
rocks
allenby
said
in
mountains
in
anything
that
got
in
its
way
and
now
the
holes
form
a
large
portion
of
its
fixed
orbit
its
mass
must
be
on
the
order
of
process
of
making
the
holes
slowed
it
so
that
now
it
travels
just
fast
enough
maintain
its
orbit
and
penetrate
occasional
objects
such
as
and
sand
dunes
my
god
i
it
a
mathematical
monstrosity
allenby
snarled
did
put
it
there
allenby
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
slowly
a
name
h
said
allenby
well
well
he
appeared
to
brighten
just
a
little
so
it
up
to
me
as
leader
of
the
expedition
to
name
it
well
well
he
said
that
tone
was
in
his
voice
we
heard
it
all
too
often
before
we
shuddered
waiting
inasmuch
as
mars
outermost
moon
is
called
deimos
and
the
next
phobos
he
said
i
think
i
shall
name
the
third
moon
of
mars
