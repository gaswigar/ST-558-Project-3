a
pair
of
blue
eyes
by
thomas
hardy
a
violet
in
the
youth
of
primy
nature
forward
not
permanent
sweet
not
lasting
the
perfume
and
suppliance
of
a
minute
no
preface
the
following
chapters
were
written
at
a
time
when
the
craze
for
indiscriminate
had
just
reached
the
remotest
nooks
of
western
england
where
the
wild
and
tragic
features
of
the
coast
had
long
combined
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
crude
gothic
art
of
the
ecclesiastical
buildings
scattered
along
it
throwing
into
extraordinary
discord
all
architectural
attempts
at
newness
there
to
restore
the
grey
carcases
of
a
mediaevalism
whose
spirit
had
fled
seemed
a
not
less
incongruous
act
than
to
set
about
renovating
the
adjoining
crags
themselves
hence
it
happened
that
an
imaginary
history
of
three
human
hearts
whose
emotions
were
not
without
correspondence
with
these
material
circumstances
found
in
the
ordinary
incidents
of
such
a
fitting
frame
for
its
presentation
the
shore
and
country
about
castle
boterel
is
now
getting
well
known
and
will
be
readily
recognized
the
spot
is
i
may
add
the
furthest
westward
of
all
those
convenient
corners
wherein
i
have
ventured
to
erect
my
theatre
for
these
imperfect
little
dramas
of
country
life
and
passions
and
it
lies
near
to
or
no
great
way
beyond
the
vague
border
of
the
wessex
kingdom
on
that
side
which
like
the
westering
verge
of
modern
american
settlements
was
progressive
and
uncertain
this
however
is
of
little
importance
the
place
is
for
one
person
at
least
the
region
of
dream
and
mystery
the
ghostly
birds
the
sea
the
frothy
wind
the
eternal
soliloquy
of
the
waters
the
bloom
of
dark
purple
cast
that
seems
to
exhale
from
the
shoreward
precipices
in
themselves
lend
to
the
scene
an
atmosphere
like
the
twilight
of
a
night
vision
one
enormous
cliff
in
particular
figures
in
the
narrative
and
for
some
forgotten
reason
or
other
this
cliff
was
described
in
the
story
as
being
without
a
name
accuracy
would
require
the
statement
to
be
that
a
remarkable
cliff
which
resembles
in
many
points
the
cliff
of
the
description
bears
a
name
that
no

has

the

mostly
on

of

chapter
i
a
fair
vestal
throned
in
the
west
elfride
swancourt
was
a
girl
whose
emotions
lay
very
near
the
surface
their
nature
more
precisely
and
as
modified
by
the
creeping
hours
of
time
was
known
only
to
those
who
watched
the
circumstances
of
her
history
personally
she
was
the
combination
of
very
interesting
particulars
whose
rarity
however
lay
in
the
combination
itself
rather
than
in
the
individual
elements
combined
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
did
not
see
the
form
and
substance
of
her
features
when
conversing
with
her
and
this
charming
power
of
preventing
a
material
study
of
her
lineaments
by
an
interlocutor
originated
not
in
the
cloaking
effect
of
a
manner
for
her
manner
was
childish
and
scarcely
formed
but
in
the
attractive
crudeness
of
the
remarks
themselves
she
had
lived
all
her
life
in
retirement
the
monstrari
gigito
of
idle
men
had
not
flattered
her
and
at
the
age
of
nineteen
or
twenty
she
was
no
further
on
in
social
consciousness
than
an
urban
young
lady
of
fifteen
one
point
in
her
however
you
did
notice
that
was
her
eyes
in
them
was
seen
a
sublimation
of
all
of
her
it
was
not
necessary
to
look
further
there
she
lived
these
eyes
were
blue
blue
as
autumn
distance
blue
as
the
blue
we
see
between
the
retreating
mouldings
of
hills
and
woody
slopes
on
a
sunny
september
morning
a
misty
and
shady
blue
that
had
no
beginning
or
surface
and
was
looked
into
rather
than
at
as
to
her
presence
it
was
not
powerful
it
was
weak
some
women
can
make
their
personality
pervade
the
atmosphere
of
a
whole
banqueting
hall
elfride
s
was
no
more
pervasive
than
that
of
a
kitten
elfride
had
as
her
own
the
thoughtfulness
which
appears
in
the
face
of
the
madonna
della
sedia
without
its
rapture
the
warmth
and
spirit
of
the
type
of
woman
s
feature
most
common
to
the
beauties
mortal
and
immortal
of
rubens
without
their
insistent
fleshiness
the
characteristic
expression
of
the
female
faces
of
correggio
that
of
the
yearning
human
thoughts
that
lie
too
deep
for
tears
was
hers
sometimes
but
seldom
under
ordinary
conditions
the
point
in
elfride
swancourt
s
life
at
which
a
deeper
current
may
be
said
to
have
permanently
set
in
was
one
winter
afternoon
when
she
found
herself
standing
in
the
character
of
hostess
face
to
face
with
a
man
she
had
never
seen
before
moreover
looking
at
him
with
a
curiosity
and
interest
that
she
had
never
yet
bestowed
on
a
mortal
on
this
particular
day
her
father
the
vicar
of
a
parish
on
the
outskirts
of
lower
wessex
and
a
widower
was
suffering
from
an
attack
of
gout
after
finishing
her
household
supervisions
elfride
became
restless
and
several
times
left
the
room
ascended
the
staircase
and
knocked
at
her
father
s
come
in
was
always
answered
in
a
hearty
voice
from
the
inside
papa
she
said
on
one
occasion
to
the
fine
handsome
man
of
forty
who
puffing
and
fizzing
like
a
bursting
bottle
lay
on
the
bed
wrapped
in
a
and
every
now
and
then
enunciating
in
spite
of
himself
about
one
letter
of
some
word
or
words
that
were
almost
oaths
papa
will
you
not
come
downstairs
this
evening
she
spoke
distinctly
he
was
rather
deaf
afraid
not
very
much
afraid
i
shall
not
elfride
i
can
t
bear
even
a
handkerchief
upon
this
deuced
toe
of
mine
much
less
a
stocking
or
slipper
there
tis
again
no
i
shan
t
get
up
till
then
i
hope
this
london
man
won
t
come
for
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
do
well
it
would
be
awkward
i
should
hardly
think
he
would
come
why
because
the
wind
blows
wind
what
ideas
you
have
elfride
who
ever
heard
of
wind
stopping
a
man
from
doing
his
business
the
idea
of
this
toe
of
mine
coming
on
so
suddenly
if
he
should
come
you
must
send
him
up
to
me
i
suppose
and
then
give
him
some
food
and
put
him
to
bed
in
some
way
dear
me
what
a
nuisance
all
this
is
must
he
have
dinner
too
heavy
for
a
tired
man
at
the
end
of
a
tedious
tea
then
not
substantial
high
tea
then
there
is
cold
fowl
some
pasties
and
things
of
that
yes
high
must
i
pour
out
his
tea
papa
of
course
you
are
the
mistress
of
the
what
sit
there
all
the
time
with
a
stranger
just
as
if
i
knew
him
and
not
anybody
to
introduce
us
nonsense
child
about
introducing
you
know
better
than
that
a
practical
professional
man
tired
and
hungry
who
has
been
travelling
ever
since
daylight
this
morning
will
hardly
be
inclined
to
talk
and
air
courtesies
he
wants
food
and
shelter
and
you
must
see
that
he
has
it
simply
because
i
am
suddenly
laid
up
and
can
not
there
is
nothing
so
dreadful
in
that
i
hope
you
get
all
kinds
of
stuff
into
your
head
from
reading
so
many
of
those
oh
no
there
is
nothing
dreadful
in
it
when
it
becomes
plainly
a
case
of
necessity
like
this
but
you
see
you
are
always
there
when
people
come
to
dinner
even
if
we
know
them
and
this
is
some
strange
london
man
of
the
world
who
will
think
it
odd
very
well
let
is
he
hewby
s
partner
i
should
scarcely
think
so
he
may
how
old
is
he
i
wonder
that
i
can
not
tell
you
will
find
the
copy
of
my
letter
to
hewby
and
his
answer
upon
the
table
in
the
study
you
may
read
them
and
then
you
ll
know
as
much
as
i
do
about
our
i
have
read
well
what
s
the
use
of
asking
questions
then
they
contain
all
i
know
od
plague
you
you
young
scamp
don
t
put
anything
there
i
can
t
bear
the
weight
of
a
oh
i
am
sorry
papa
i
forgot
i
thought
you
might
be
cold
she
said
hastily
removing
the
rug
she
had
thrown
upon
the
feet
of
the
sufferer
and
waiting
till
she
saw
that
consciousness
of
her
offence
had
passed
from
his
face
she
withdrew
from
the
room
and
retired
again
downstairs
chapter
ii
twas
on
the
evening
of
a
winter
s
when
two
or
three
additional
hours
had
merged
the
same
afternoon
in
evening
some
moving
outlines
might
have
been
observed
against
the
sky
on
the
summit
of
a
wild
lone
hill
in
that
district
they
circumscribed
two
men
having
at
present
the
aspect
of
silhouettes
sitting
in
a
and
pushing
along
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
scarcely
a
solitary
house
or
man
had
been
visible
along
the
whole
dreary
distance
of
open
country
they
were
traversing
and
now
that
night
had
begun
to
fall
the
faint
twilight
which
still
gave
an
idea
of
the
landscape
to
their
observation
was
enlivened
by
the
quiet
appearance
of
the
planet
jupiter
momentarily
gleaming
in
intenser
brilliancy
in
front
of
them
and
by
sirius
shedding
his
rays
in
rivalry
from
his
position
over
their
shoulders
the
only
lights
apparent
on
earth
were
some
spots
of
dull
red
glowing
here
and
there
upon
the
distant
hills
which
as
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
gratuitously
remarked
to
the
hirer
were
smouldering
fires
for
the
consumption
of
peat
and
where
the
common
was
being
broken
up
for
agricultural
purposes
the
wind
prevailed
with
but
little
abatement
from
its
daytime
boisterousness
three
or
four
small
clouds
delicate
and
pale
creeping
along
under
the
sky
southward
to
the
channel
fourteen
of
the
sixteen
miles
intervening
between
the
railway
terminus
and
the
end
of
their
journey
had
been
gone
over
when
they
began
to
pass
along
the
brink
of
a
valley
some
miles
in
extent
wherein
the
wintry
skeletons
of
a
more
luxuriant
vegetation
than
had
hitherto
surrounded
them
proclaimed
an
increased
richness
of
soil
which
showed
signs
of
far
more
careful
enclosure
and
management
than
had
any
slopes
they
had
yet
passed
a
little
farther
and
an
opening
in
the
elms
stretching
up
from
this
fertile
valley
revealed
a
mansion
that
s
endelstow
house
lord
luxellian
s
said
the
driver
endelstow
house
lord
luxellian
s
repeated
the
other
mechanically
he
then
turned
himself
sideways
and
keenly
scrutinized
the
almost
invisible
house
with
an
interest
which
the
indistinct
picture
itself
seemed
far
from
adequate
to
create
yes
that
s
lord
luxellian
s
he
said
yet
again
after
a
while
as
he
still
looked
in
the
same
direction
what
be
we
going
there
no
endelstow
vicarage
as
i
have
told
i
thought
you
m
t
have
altered
your
mind
sir
as
ye
have
stared
that
way
at
nothing
so
oh
no
i
am
interested
in
the
house
that
s
most
people
be
as
the
saying
not
in
the
sense
that
i
oh
well
his
family
is
no
better
than
my
own
a
b
how
is
that
hedgers
and
ditchers
by
rights
but
once
in
ancient
times
one
of
em
when
he
was
at
work
changed
clothes
with
king
charles
the
second
and
saved
the
king
s
life
king
charles
came
up
to
him
like
a
common
man
and
said
man
in
the
my
name
is
charles
the
second
and
that
s
the
truth
on
t
will
you
lend
me
your
clothes
i
don
t
mind
if
i
do
said
hedger
luxellian
and
they
changed
there
and
then
now
mind
ye
king
charles
the
second
said
like
a
common
man
as
he
rode
away
if
ever
i
come
to
the
crown
you
come
to
court
knock
at
the
door
and
say
out
bold
is
king
charles
the
second
at
home
tell
your
name
and
they
shall
let
you
in
and
you
shall
be
made
a
now
that
was
very
nice
of
master
charley
very
nice
well
as
the
story
is
the
king
came
to
the
throne
and
some
years
after
that
away
went
hedger
luxellian
knocked
at
the
king
s
door
and
asked
if
king
charles
the
second
was
in
no
he
isn
t
they
said
then
is
charles
the
third
said
hedger
luxellian
yes
said
a
young
feller
standing
by
like
a
common
man
only
he
had
a
crown
on
my
name
is
charles
the
and
i
really
fancy
that
must
be
a
mistake
i
don
t
recollect
anything
in
english
history
about
charles
the
third
said
the
other
in
a
tone
of
mild
remonstrance
oh
that
s
right
history
enough
only
twasn
t
prented
he
was
rather
a
man
if
you
very
well
go
and
by
hook
or
by
crook
hedger
luxellian
was
made
a
lord
and
everything
went
on
well
till
some
time
after
when
he
got
into
a
most
terrible
row
with
king
charles
the
fourth
i
can
t
stand
charles
the
fourth
upon
my
word
that
s
too
why
there
was
a
george
the
fourth
wasn
t
there
well
charleses
be
as
common
as
georges
however
i
ll
say
no
more
about
it
well
tis
the
funniest
world
ever
i
lived
in
upon
my
life
tis
ah
that
such
should
be
the
dusk
had
thickened
into
darkness
while
they
thus
conversed
and
the
outline
and
surface
of
the
mansion
gradually
disappeared
the
windows
which
had
before
been
as
black
blots
on
a
lighter
expanse
of
wall
became
illuminated
and
were
transfigured
to
squares
of
light
on
the
general
dark
body
of
the
night
landscape
as
it
absorbed
the
outlines
of
the
edifice
into
its
gloomy
monochrome
not
another
word
was
spoken
for
some
time
and
they
climbed
a
hill
then
another
hill
piled
on
the
summit
of
the
first
an
additional
mile
of
plateau
followed
from
which
could
be
discerned
two
on
the
coast
they
were
nearing
reposing
on
the
horizon
with
a
calm
lustre
of
benignity
another
oasis
was
reached
a
little
dell
lay
like
a
nest
at
their
feet
towards
which
the
driver
pulled
the
horse
at
a
sharp
angle
and
descended
a
steep
slope
which
dived
under
the
trees
like
a
rabbit
s
burrow
they
sank
lower
and
lower
endelstow

continued
the
man
with
the

the
pa
son
of
both
and
bobs
backward
and
forward
ah
well
tis
a
funny
world
a
b
lieve
there
was
once
a
quarry
where
this
house
stands
the
man
who
built
it
in
past
time
scraped
all
the
glebe
for
earth
to
put
round
the
vicarage
and
laid
out
a
little
paradise
of
flowers
and
trees
in
the
soil
he
had
got
together
in
this
way
whilst
the
fields
he
scraped
have
been
good
for
nothing
ever
how
long
has
the
present
incumbent
been
here
maybe
about
a
year
or
a
year
and
half
tisn
t
two
years
for
they
don
t
scandalize
him
yet
and
as
a
rule
a
parish
begins
to
scandalize
the
pa
son
at
the
end
of
two
years
among
em
familiar
but
he
s
a
very
nice
party
ay
pa
son
swancourt
knows
me
pretty
well
from
often
driving
over
and
i
know
pa
son
they
emerged
from
the
bower
swept
round
in
a
curve
and
the
chimneys
and
gables
of
the
vicarage
became
darkly
visible
not
a
light
showed
anywhere
they
alighted
the
man
felt
his
way
into
the
porch
and
rang
the
bell
at
the
end
of
three
or
four
minutes
spent
in
patient
waiting
without
hearing
any
sounds
of
a
response
the
stranger
advanced
and
repeated
the
call
in
a
more
decided
manner
he
then
fancied
he
heard
footsteps
in
the
hall
and
sundry
movements
of
the
but
nobody
appeared
perhaps
they
beant
at
home
sighed
the
driver
and
i
promised
myself
a
bit
of
supper
in
pa
son
swancourt
s
kitchen
sich
lovely
and
figged
keakes
and
cider
and

or
be
ye
poor
men
that
ye
must
needs
come
to
the
world
s
end
at
this
time
o
night
exclaimed
a
voice
at
this
instant
and
turning
their
heads
they
saw
a
rickety
individual
shambling
round
from
the
back
door
with
a
horn
lantern
dangling
from
his
hand
time
o
night
a
b
lieve
and
the
clock
only
gone
seven
of
em
show
a
light
and
let
us
in
william
oh
that
you
robert
lickpan
nobody
else
william
and
is
the
visiting
man
yes
said
the
stranger
is
swancourt
at
home
that
a
is
sir
and
would
ye
mind
coming
round
by
the
back
way
the
front
door
is
got
stuck
wi
the
wet
as
he
will
do
sometimes
and
the
turk
can
t
open
en
i
know
i
am
only
a
poor
wambling
man
that
ill
never
pay
the
lord
for
my
making
sir
but
i
can
show
the
way
in
the
new
arrival
followed
his
guide
through
a
little
door
in
a
wall
and
then
promenaded
a
scullery
and
a
kitchen
along
which
he
passed
with
eyes
rigidly
fixed
in
advance
an
inbred
horror
of
prying
forbidding
him
to
gaze
around
apartments
that
formed
the
back
side
of
the
household
tapestry
entering
the
hall
he
was
about
to
be
shown
to
his
room
when
from
the
inner
lobby
of
the
front
entrance
whither
she
had
gone
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
delay
sailed
forth
the
form
of
elfride
her
start
of
amazement
at
the
sight
of
the
visitor
coming
forth
from
under
the
stairs
proved
that
she
had
not
been
expecting
this
surprising
flank
movement
which
had
been
originated
entirely
by
the
ingenuity
of
william
worm
she
appeared
in
the
prettiest
of
all
feminine
guises
that
is
to
say
in
with
plenty
of
loose
curly
hair
tumbling
down
about
her
shoulders
an
expression
of
uneasiness
pervaded
her
countenance
and
altogether
she
scarcely
appeared
woman
enough
for
the
situation
the
visitor
removed
his
hat
and
the
first
words
were
spoken
elfride
prelusively
looking
with
a
deal
of
interest
not
unmixed
with
surprise
at
the
person
towards
whom
she
was
to
do
the
duties
of
hospitality
i
am
smith
said
the
stranger
in
a
musical
voice
i
am
miss
swancourt
said
elfride
her
constraint
was
over
the
great
contrast
between
the
reality
she
beheld
before
her
and
the
dark
taciturn
sharp
elderly
man
of
business
who
had
lurked
in
her
imagination
a
man
with
clothes
smelling
of
city
smoke
skin
sallow
from
want
of
sun
and
talk
flavoured
with
epigram
was
such
a
relief
to
her
that
elfride
smiled
almost
laughed
in
the
s
face
stephen
smith
who
has
hitherto
been
hidden
from
us
by
the
darkness
was
at
this
time
of
his
life
but
a
youth
in
appearance
and
barely
a
man
in
years
judging
from
his
look
london
was
the
last
place
in
the
world
that
one
would
have
imagined
to
be
the
scene
of
his
activities
such
a
face
surely
could
not
be
nourished
amid
smoke
and
mud
and
fog
and
dust
such
an
open
countenance
could
never
even
have
seen
anything
of
the
weariness
the
fever
and
the
fret
of
babylon
the
second
his
complexion
was
as
fine
as
elfride
s
own
the
pink
of
his
cheeks
as
delicate
his
mouth
as
perfect
as
cupid
s
bow
in
form
and
as
in
colour
as
hers
bright
curly
hair
bright
sparkling
eyes
a
boy
s
blush
and
manner
neither
whisker
nor
moustache
unless
a
little
fur
on
his
upper
lip
deserved
the
latter
title
this
composed
the
london
professional
man
the
prospect
of
whose
advent
had
so
troubled
elfride
elfride
hastened
to
say
she
was
sorry
to
tell
him
that
swancourt
was
not
able
to
receive
him
that
evening
and
gave
the
reason
why
smith
replied
in
a
voice
boyish
by
nature
and
manly
by
art
that
he
was
very
sorry
to
hear
this
news
but
that
as
far
as
his
reception
was
concerned
it
did
not
matter
in
the
least
stephen
was
shown
up
to
his
room
in
his
absence
elfride
stealthily
glided
into
her
father
s
he
s
come
papa
such
a
young
man
for
a
business
man
oh
indeed
his
face
is
well
pretty
just
like
h
m
what
next
nothing
that
s
all
i
know
of
him
yet
it
is
rather
nice
is
it
not
well
we
shall
see
that
when
we
know
him
better
go
down
and
give
the
poor
fellow
something
to
eat
and
drink
for
heaven
s
sake
and
when
he
has
done
eating
say
i
should
like
to
have
a
few
words
with
him
if
he
doesn
t
mind
coming
up
the
young
lady
glided
downstairs
again
and
whilst
she
awaits
young
smith
s
entry
the
letters
referring
to
his
visit
had
better
be
given
mr
swancourt
to
hewby
endelstow
vicarage
sir
we
are
thinking
of
restoring
the
tower
and
aisle
of
the
church
in
this
parish
and
lord
luxellian
the
patron
of
the
living
has
mentioned
your
name
as
that
of
a
trustworthy
architect
whom
it
would
be
desirable
to
ask
to
superintend
the
work
i
am
exceedingly
ignorant
of
the
necessary
preliminary
steps
probably
however
the
first
is
that
should
you
be
as
lord
luxellian
says
you
are
disposed
to
assist
us
yourself
or
some
member
of
your
staff
come
and
see
the
building
and
report
thereupon
for
the
satisfaction
of
parishioners
and
others
the
spot
is
a
very
remote
one
we
have
no
railway
within
fourteen
miles
and
the
nearest
place
for
putting
up
at
called
a
town
though
merely
a
large
village
is
castle
boterel
two
miles
further
on
so
that
it
would
be
most
convenient
for
you
to
stay
at
the
vicarage
which
i
am
glad
to
place
at
your
disposal
instead
of
pushing
on
to
the
hotel
at
castle
boterel
and
coming
back
again
in
the
morning
any
day
of
the
next
week
that
you
like
to
name
for
the
visit
will
find
us
quite
ready
to
receive
yours
very
truly
christopher
swancourt
mr
hewby
to
swancourt
percy
place
charing
cross
dear
sir
agreeably
to
your
request
of
the
instant
i
have
arranged
to
survey
and
make
drawings
of
the
aisle
and
tower
of
your
parish
church
and
of
the
dilapidations
which
have
been
suffered
to
accrue
thereto
with
a
view
to
its
restoration
my
assistant
stephen
smith
will
leave
london
by
the
early
train
morning
for
the
purpose
many
thanks
for
your
proposal
to
accommodate
him
he
will
take
advantage
of
your
offer
and
will
probably
reach
your
house
at
some
hour
of
the
evening
you
may
put
every
confidence
in
him
and
may
rely
upon
his
discernment
in
the
matter
of
church
architecture
trusting
that
the
plans
for
the
restoration
which
i
shall
prepare
from
the
details
of
his
survey
will
prove
satisfactory
to
yourself
and
lord
luxellian
i
am
dear
sir
yours
faithfully

chapter
iii
melodious
birds
sing
madrigals
that
first
repast
in
endelstow
vicarage
was
a
very
agreeable
one
to
young
stephen
smith
the
table
was
spread
as
elfride
had
suggested
to
her
father
with
the
materials
for
the
heterogeneous
meal
called
high
tea
a
class
of
refection
welcome
to
all
when
away
from
men
and
towns
and
particularly
attractive
to
youthful
palates
the
table
was
prettily
decked
with
winter
flowers
and
leaves
amid
which
the
eye
was
greeted
by
chops
chicken
pie
and
two
huge
pasties
overhanging
the
sides
of
the
dish
with
a
cheerful
aspect
of
abundance
at
the
end
towards
the
fireplace
appeared
the
of
worcester
porcelain
and
behind
this
arose
the
slight
form
of
elfride
attempting
to
add
matronly
dignity
to
the
movement
of
pouring
out
tea
and
to
have
a
weighty
and
concerned
look
in
matters
of
marmalade
honey
and
clotted
cream
having
made
her
own
meal
before
he
arrived
she
found
to
her
embarrassment
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
her
to
do
but
talk
when
not
assisting
him
she
asked
him
if
he
would
excuse
her
finishing
a
letter
she
had
been
writing
at
a
and
after
sitting
down
to
it
tingled
with
a
sense
of
being
grossly
rude
however
seeing
that
he
noticed
nothing
personally
wrong
in
her
and
that
he
too
was
embarrassed
when
she
attentively
watched
his
cup
to
refill
it
elfride
became
better
at
ease
and
when
furthermore
he
accidentally
kicked
the
leg
of
the
table
and
then
nearly
upset
his
just
as
schoolboys
did
she
felt
herself
mistress
of
the
situation
and
could
talk
very
well
in
a
few
minutes
ingenuousness
and
a
common
term
of
years
obliterated
all
recollection
that
they
were
strangers
just
met
stephen
began
to
wax
eloquent
on
extremely
slight
experiences
connected
with
his
professional
pursuits
and
she
having
no
experiences
to
fall
back
upon
recounted
with
much
animation
stories
that
had
been
related
to
her
by
her
father
which
would
have
astonished
him
had
he
heard
with
what
fidelity
of
action
and
tone
they
were
rendered
upon
the
whole
a
very
interesting
picture
of
was
on
view
that
evening
in
swancourt
s
house
ultimately
stephen
had
to
go
upstairs
and
talk
loud
to
the
vicar
receiving
from
him
between
his
puffs
a
great
many
apologies
for
calling
him
so
unceremoniously
to
a
stranger
s
bedroom
but
continued
swancourt
i
felt
that
i
wanted
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
before
the
morning
on
the
business
of
your
visit
one
s
patience
gets
exhausted
by
staying
a
prisoner
in
bed
all
day
through
a
sudden
freak
of
one
s
enemy
new
to
me
though
for
i
have
known
very
little
of
gout
as
yet
however
he
s
gone
to
my
other
toe
in
a
very
mild
manner
and
i
expect
he
ll
slink
off
altogether
by
the
morning
i
hope
you
have
been
well
attended
to
downstairs
perfectly
and
though
it
is
unfortunate
and
i
am
sorry
to
see
you
laid
up
i
beg
you
will
not
take
the
slightest
notice
of
my
being
in
the
house
the
i
will
not
but
i
shall
be
down
my
daughter
is
an
excellent
doctor
a
dose
or
two
of
her
mild
mixtures
will
fetch
me
round
quicker
than
all
the
drug
stuff
in
the
world
well
now
about
the
church
business
take
a
seat
do
we
can
t
afford
to
stand
upon
ceremony
in
these
parts
as
you
see
and
for
this
reason
that
a
civilized
human
being
seldom
stays
long
with
us
and
so
we
can
not
waste
time
in
approaching
him
or
he
will
be
gone
before
we
have
had
the
pleasure
of
close
acquaintance
this
tower
of
ours
is
as
you
will
notice
entirely
gone
beyond
the
possibility
of
restoration
but
the
church
itself
is
well
enough
you
should
see
some
of
the
churches
in
this
county
floors
rotten
ivy
lining
the
dear
me
oh
that
s
nothing
the
congregation
of
a
neighbour
of
mine
whenever
a
storm
of
rain
comes
on
during
service
open
their
umbrellas
and
hold
them
up
till
the
dripping
ceases
from
the
roof
now
if
you
will
kindly
bring
me
those
papers
and
letters
you
see
lying
on
the
table
i
will
show
you
how
far
we
have
stephen
crossed
the
room
to
fetch
them
and
the
vicar
seemed
to
notice
more
particularly
the
slim
figure
of
his
visitor
i
suppose
you
are
quite
competent
he
said
quite
said
the
young
man
colouring
slightly
you
are
very
young
i
fancy
i
should
say
you
are
not
more
than
nineteen
i
am
nearly
exactly
half
my
age
i
am
by
the
way
said
swancourt
after
some
conversation
you
said
your
whole
name
was
stephen
fitzmaurice
and
that
your
grandfather
came
originally
from
caxbury
since
i
have
been
speaking
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
i
know
something
of
you
you
belong
to
a
ancient
county
family
not
ordinary
smiths
in
the
i
don
t
think
we
have
any
of
their
blood
in
our
nonsense
you
must
hand
me
the
landed
now
let
me
see
there
stephen
fitzmaurice
smith
he
lies
in
mary
s
church
doesn
t
he
well
out
of
that
family
sprang
the
leaseworthy
smiths
and
collaterally
came
general
sir
stephen
fitzmaurice
smith
of
caxbury
yes
i
have
seen
his
monument
there
shouted
stephen
but
there
is
no
connection
between
his
family
and
mine
there
can
not
there
is
none
possibly
to
your
knowledge
but
look
at
this
my
dear
sir
said
the
vicar
striking
his
fist
upon
the
bedpost
for
emphasis
here
are
you
stephen
fitzmaurice
smith
living
in
london
but
springing
from
caxbury
here
in
this
book
is
a
genealogical
tree
of
the
stephen
fitzmaurice
smiths
of
caxbury
manor
you
may
be
only
a
family
of
professional
men
now
i
am
not
inquisitive
i
don
t
ask
questions
of
that
kind
it
is
not
in
me
to
do
so
but
it
is
as
plain
as
the
nose
in
your
face
that
there
s
your
origin
and
smith
i
congratulate
you
upon
your
blood
blue
blood
sir
and
upon
my
life
a
very
desirable
colour
as
the
world
i
wish
you
could
congratulate
me
upon
some
more
tangible
quality
said
the
younger
man
sadly
no
less
than
modestly
nonsense
that
will
come
with
time
you
are
young
all
your
life
is
before
you
now
look
see
how
far
back
in
the
mists
of
antiquity
my
own
family
of
swancourt
have
a
root
here
you
see
he
continued
turning
to
the
page
is
geoffrey
the
one
among
my
ancestors
who
lost
a
barony
because
he
would
cut
his
joke
ah
it
s
the
sort
of
us
but
the
story
is
too
long
to
tell
now
ay
i
m
a
poor
man
a
poor
gentleman
in
fact
those
i
would
be
friends
with
won
t
be
friends
with
me
those
who
are
willing
to
be
friends
with
me
i
am
above
being
friends
with
beyond
dining
with
a
neighbouring
incumbent
or
two
and
an
occasional
chat
sometimes
dinner
with
lord
luxellian
a
connection
of
mine
i
am
in
absolute
solitude
you
have
your
studies
your
books
and
your
oh
yes
yes
and
i
don
t
complain
of
poverty
canto
coram
latrone
well
smith
don
t
let
me
detain
you
any
longer
in
a
sick
room
ha
that
reminds
me
of
a
story
i
once
heard
in
my
younger
here
the
vicar
began
a
series
of
small
private
laughs
and
stephen
looked
inquiry
oh
no
no
it
is
too
bad
too
bad
to
tell
continued
swancourt
in
undertones
of
grim
mirth
well
go
downstairs
my
daughter
must
do
the
best
she
can
with
you
this
evening
ask
her
to
sing
to
you
she
plays
and
sings
very
nicely
i
feel
as
if
i
had
known
you
for
five
or
six
years
i
ll
ring
for
somebody
to
show
you
never
mind
said
stephen
i
can
find
the
and
he
went
downstairs
thinking
of
the
delightful
freedom
of
manner
in
the
remoter
counties
in
comparison
with
the
reserve
of
london
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
my
father
was
rather
deaf
said
elfride
anxiously
when
stephen
entered
the
little
never
mind
i
know
all
about
it
and
we
are
great
friends
the
man
of
business
replied
enthusiastically
and
miss
swancourt
will
you
kindly
sing
to
me
to
miss
swancourt
this
request
seemed
what
in
fact
it
was
exceptionally
though
she
guessed
that
her
father
had
some
hand
in
framing
it
knowing
rather
to
her
cost
of
his
unceremonious
way
of
utilizing
her
for
the
benefit
of
dull
sojourners
at
the
same
time
as
smith
s
manner
was
too
frank
to
provoke
criticism
and
his
age
too
little
to
inspire
fear
she
was
ready
not
to
say
pleased
to
accede
selecting
from
the
canterbury
some
old
family
ditties
that
in
years
gone
by
had
been
played
and
sung
by
her
mother
elfride
sat
down
to
the
pianoforte
and
began
twas
on
the
evening
of
a
winter
s
day
in
a
pretty
contralto
voice
do
you
like
that
old
thing
smith
she
said
at
the
end
yes
i
do
much
said
stephen
words
he
would
have
uttered
and
sincerely
to
anything
on
earth
from
glee
to
requiem
that
she
might
have
chosen
you
shall
have
a
little
one
by
de
leyre
that
was
given
me
by
a
young
french
lady
who
was
staying
at
endelstow
house
je
l
ai
plante
je
l
ai
vu
naitre
ce
beau
rosier
ou
les
oiseaux
and
then
i
shall
want
to
give
you
my
own
favourite
for
the
very
last
shelley
s
when
the
lamp
is
shattered
as
set
to
music
by
my
poor
mother
i
so
much
like
singing
to
anybody
who
really
cares
to
hear
every
woman
who
makes
a
permanent
impression
on
a
man
is
usually
recalled
to
his
mind
s
eye
as
she
appeared
in
one
particular
scene
which
seems
ordained
to
be
her
special
form
of
manifestation
throughout
the
pages
of
his
memory
as
the
patron
saint
has
her
attitude
and
accessories
in
mediaeval
illumination
so
the
sweetheart
may
be
said
to
have
hers
upon
the
table
of
her
true
love
s
fancy
without
which
she
is
rarely
introduced
there
except
by
effort
and
this
though
she
may
on
further
acquaintance
have
been
observed
in
many
other
phases
which
one
would
imagine
to
be
far
more
appropriate
to
love
s
young
dream
miss
elfride
s
image
chose
the
form
in
which
she
was
beheld
during
these
minutes
of
singing
for
her
permanent
attitude
of
visitation
to
stephen
s
eyes
during
his
sleeping
and
waking
hours
in
after
days
the
profile
is
seen
of
a
young
woman
in
a
pale
gray
silk
dress
with
trimmings
of
swan
and
opening
up
from
a
point
in
front
like
a
waistcoat
without
a
shirt
the
cool
colour
contrasting
admirably
with
the
warm
bloom
of
her
neck
and
face
the
furthermost
candle
on
the
piano
comes
immediately
in
a
line
with
her
head
and
half
invisible
itself
forms
the
accidentally
frizzled
hair
into
a
nebulous
haze
of
light
surrounding
her
crown
like
an
aureola
her
hands
are
in
their
place
on
the
keys
her
lips
parted
and
trilling
forth
in
a
tender
diminuendo
the
closing
words
of
the
sad
apostrophe
o
love
who
bewailest
the
frailty
of
all
things
here
why
choose
you
the
frailest
for
your
cradle
your
home
and
your
bier
her
head
is
forward
a
little
and
her
eyes
directed
keenly
upward
to
the
top
of
the
page
of
music
confronting
her
then
comes
a
rapid
look
into
stephen
s
face
and
a
still
more
rapid
look
back
again
to
her
business
her
face
having
dropped
its
sadness
and
acquired
a
certain
expression
of
mischievous
archness
the
while
which
lingered
there
for
some
time
but
was
never
developed
into
a
positive
smile
of
flirtation
stephen
suddenly
shifted
his
position
from
her
right
hand
to
her
left
where
there
was
just
room
enough
for
a
small
ottoman
to
stand
between
the
piano
and
the
corner
of
the
room
into
this
nook
he
squeezed
himself
and
gazed
wistfully
up
into
elfride
s
face
so
long
and
so
earnestly
gazed
he
that
her
cheek
deepened
to
a
more
and
more
crimson
tint
as
each
line
was
added
to
her
song
concluding
and
pausing
motionless
after
the
last
word
for
a
minute
or
two
she
ventured
to
look
at
him
again
his
features
wore
an
expression
of
unutterable
heaviness
you
don
t
hear
many
songs
do
you
smith
to
take
so
much
notice
of
these
of
mine
perhaps
it
was
the
means
and
vehicle
of
the
song
that
i
was
noticing
i
mean
yourself
he
answered
gently
now
smith
it
is
perfectly
true
i
don
t
hear
much
singing
you
mistake
what
i
am
i
fancy
because
i
come
as
a
stranger
to
a
secluded
spot
you
think
i
must
needs
come
from
a
life
of
bustle
and
know
the
latest
movements
of
the
day
but
i
don
t
my
life
is
as
quiet
as
yours
and
more
solitary
solitary
as
the
death
which
comes
from
a
plethora
of
life
but
seriously
i
can
quite
see
that
you
are
not
the
least
what
i
thought
you
would
be
before
i
saw
you
you
are
not
critical
or
experienced
or
much
to
mind
that
s
why
i
don
t
mind
singing
airs
to
you
that
i
only
half
finding
that
by
this
confession
she
had
vexed
him
in
a
way
she
did
not
intend
she
added
naively
i
mean
smith
that
you
are
better
not
worse
for
being
only
young
and
not
very
experienced
you
don
t
think
my
life
here
so
very
tame
and
dull
i
i
do
not
indeed
he
said
with
fervour
it
must
be
delightfully
poetical
and
sparkling
and
fresh
and
there
you
go
smith
well
men
of
another
kind
when
i
get
them
to
be
honest
enough
to
own
the
truth
think
just
the
reverse
that
my
life
must
be
a
dreadful
bore
in
its
normal
state
though
pleasant
for
the
exceptional
few
days
they
pass
i
could
live
here
always
he
said
and
with
such
a
tone
and
look
of
unconscious
revelation
that
elfride
was
startled
to
find
that
her
harmonies
had
fired
a
small
troy
in
the
shape
of
stephen
s
heart
she
said
quickly
but
you
can
t
live
here
oh
and
he
drew
himself
in
with
the
sensitiveness
of
a
snail
elfride
s
emotions
were
sudden
as
his
in
kindling
but
the
least
of
woman
s
lesser
infirmities
love
of
admiration
caused
an
inflammable
disposition
on
his
part
so
exactly
similar
to
her
own
to
appear
as
meritorious
in
him
as
modesty
made
her
own
seem
culpable
in
her
chapter
iv
where
heaves
the
turf
in
many
a
mould
ring
for
reasons
of
his
own
stephen
smith
was
stirring
a
short
time
after
dawn
the
next
morning
from
the
window
of
his
room
he
could
see
first
two
bold
escarpments
sloping
down
together
like
the
letter
towards
the
bottom
like
liquid
in
a
funnel
appeared
the
sea
gray
and
small
on
the
brow
of
one
hill
of
rather
greater
altitude
than
its
neighbour
stood
the
church
which
was
to
be
the
scene
of
his
operations
the
lonely
edifice
was
black
and
bare
cutting
up
into
the
sky
from
the
very
tip
of
the
hill
it
had
a
square
mouldering
tower
owning
neither
battlement
nor
pinnacle
and
seemed
a
monolithic
termination
of
one
substance
with
the
ridge
rather
than
a
structure
raised
thereon
round
the
church
ran
a
low
wall
the
wall
in
general
level
was
the
graveyard
not
as
a
graveyard
usually
is
a
fragment
of
landscape
with
its
due
variety
of
but
a
mere
profile
against
the
sky
serrated
with
the
outlines
of
graves
and
a
very
few
memorial
stones
not
a
tree
could
exist
up
there
nothing
but
the
monotonous
grass
five
minutes
after
this
casual
survey
was
made
his
bedroom
was
empty
and
its
occupant
had
vanished
quietly
from
the
house
at
the
end
of
two
hours
he
was
again
in
the
room
looking
warm
and
glowing
he
now
pursued
the
artistic
details
of
dressing
which
on
his
first
rising
had
been
entirely
omitted
and
a
very
blooming
boy
he
looked
after
that
mysterious
morning
scamper
his
mouth
was
a
triumph
of
its
class
it
was
the
piquantly
mouth
of
william
pitt
as
represented
in
the
well
or
little
known
bust
by
nollekens
a
mouth
which
is
in
itself
a
young
man
s
fortune
if
properly
exercised
his
round
chin
where
its
upper
part
turned
inward
still
continued
its
perfect
and
full
curve
seeming
to
press
in
to
a
point
the
bottom
of
his
nether
lip
at
their
place
of
junction
once
he
murmured
the
name
of
elfride
ah
there
she
was
on
the
lawn
in
a
plain
dress
without
hat
or
bonnet
running
with
a
boy
s
velocity
superadded
to
a
girl
s
lightness
after
a
tame
rabbit
she
was
endeavouring
to
capture
her
strategic
intonations
of
coaxing
words
alternating
with
desperate
rushes
so
much
out
of
keeping
with
them
that
the
hollowness
of
such
expressions
was
but
too
evident
to
her
pet
who
darted
and
dodged
in
carefully
timed
counterpart
the
scene
down
there
was
altogether
different
from
that
of
the
hills
a
thicket
of
shrubs
and
trees
enclosed
the
favoured
spot
from
the
wilderness
without
even
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
grass
was
luxuriant
there
no
wind
blew
inside
the
protecting
belt
of
evergreens
wasting
its
force
upon
the
higher
and
stronger
trees
forming
the
outer
margin
of
the
grove
then
he
heard
a
heavy
person
shuffling
about
in
slippers
and
calling
mr
smith
smith
proceeded
to
the
study
and
found
swancourt
the
young
man
expressed
his
gladness
to
see
his
host
downstairs
oh
yes
i
knew
i
should
soon
be
right
again
i
have
not
made
the
acquaintance
of
gout
for
more
than
two
years
and
it
generally
goes
off
the
second
night
well
where
have
you
been
this
morning
i
saw
you
come
in
just
now
i
think
yes
i
have
been
for
a
start
early
very
early
i
think
yes
it
was
rather
which
way
did
you
go
to
the
sea
i
suppose
everybody
goes
no
i
followed
up
the
river
as
far
as
the
park
you
are
different
from
your
kind
well
i
suppose
such
a
wild
place
is
a
novelty
and
so
tempted
you
out
of
bed
not
altogether
a
novelty
i
like
the
youth
seemed
averse
to
explanation
you
must
you
must
to
go
the
morning
after
a
journey
of
fourteen
or
sixteen
hours
but
there
s
no
accounting
for
tastes
and
i
am
glad
to
see
that
yours
are
no
meaner
after
breakfast
but
not
before
i
shall
be
good
for
a
ten
miles
walk
master
certainly
there
seemed
nothing
exaggerated
in
that
assertion
swancourt
by
daylight
showed
himself
to
be
a
man
who
in
common
with
the
other
two
people
under
his
roof
had
really
strong
claims
to
be
considered
handsome
handsome
that
is
in
the
sense
in
which
the
moon
is
bright
the
ravines
and
valleys
which
on
a
close
inspection
are
seen
to
diversify
its
surface
being
left
out
of
the
argument
his
face
was
of
a
tint
that
never
deepened
upon
his
cheeks
nor
lightened
upon
his
forehead
but
remained
uniform
throughout
the
usual
neutral
of
a
man
who
feeds
well
not
to
say
too
well
and
does
not
think
hard
every
pore
being
in
visible
working
order
his
tout
ensemble
was
that
of
a
highly
improved
class
of
farmer
dressed
up
in
the
wrong
clothes
that
of
a
perpendicular
man
whose
fall
would
have
been
backwards
in
direction
if
he
had
ever
lost
his
balance
the
vicar
s
background
was
at
present
what
a
vicar
s
background
should
be
his
study
here
the
consistency
ends
all
along
the
chimneypiece
were
ranged
bottles
of
horse
pig
and
cow
medicines
and
against
the
wall
was
a
high
table
made
up
of
the
fragments
of
an
old
oak
iychgate
upon
this
stood
stuffed
specimens
of
owls
divers
and
gulls
and
over
them
bunches
of
wheat
and
barley
ears
labelled
with
the
date
of
the
year
that
produced
them
some
cases
and
shelves
more
or
less
laden
with
books
the
prominent
titles
of
which
were
brown
s
notes
on
the
romans
smith
s
notes
on
the
corinthians
and
robinson
s
notes
on
the
galatians
ephesians
and
philippians
just
saved
the
character
of
the
place
in
spite
of
a
girl
s
doll
standing
above
them
a
marine
aquarium
in
the
window
and
elfride
s
hat
hanging
on
its
corner
business
business
said
swancourt
after
breakfast
he
began
to
find
it
necessary
to
act
the
part
of
a
towards
the
somewhat
irregular
forces
of
his
visitor
they
prepared
to
go
to
the
church
the
vicar
on
second
thoughts
mounting
his
mare
to
avoid
exerting
his
foot
too
much
at
starting
stephen
said
he
should
want
a
man
to
assist
him
worm
the
vicar
shouted
a
minute
or
two
after
a
voice
was
heard
round
the
corner
of
the
building
mumbling
ah
i
used
to
be
strong
enough
but
tis
altered
now
well
there
i
m
as
independent
as
one
here
and
there
even
if
they
do
write
squire
after
their
what
s
the
matter
said
the
vicar
as
william
worm
appeared
when
the
remarks
were
repeated
to
him
worm
says
some
very
true
things
sometimes
swancourt
said
turning
to
stephen
now
as
regards
that
word
why
smith
that
word
esquire
is
gone
to
the
dogs
used
on
the
letters
of
every
jackanapes
who
has
a
black
coat
anything
else
worm
ay
the
folk
have
begun
frying
again
dear
me
i
m
sorry
to
hear
yes
worm
said
groaningly
to
stephen
i
ve
got
such
a
noise
in
my
head
that
there
s
no
living
night
nor
day
tis
just
for
all
the
world
like
people
frying
fish
fry
fry
fry
all
day
long
in
my
poor
head
till
i
don
t
know
whe
r
i
m
here
or
yonder
there
god
a
mighty
will
find
it
out
sooner
or
later
i
hope
and
relieve
now
my
deafness
said
swancourt
impressively
is
a
dead
silence
but
william
worm
s
is
that
of
people
frying
fish
in
his
head
very
remarkable
isn
t
it
i
can
hear
the
as
naterel
as
life
said
worm
corroboratively
yes
it
is
remarkable
said
smith
very
peculiar
very
peculiar
echoed
the
vicar
and
they
all
then
followed
the
path
up
the
hill
bounded
on
each
side
by
a
little
stone
wall
from
which
gleamed
fragments
of
quartz
and
marbles
apparently
of
inestimable
value
in
their
setting
of
brown
alluvium
stephen
walked
with
the
dignity
of
a
man
close
to
the
horse
s
head
worm
stumbled
along
a
stone
s
throw
in
the
rear
and
elfride
was
nowhere
in
particular
yet
everywhere
sometimes
in
front
sometimes
behind
sometimes
at
the
sides
hovering
about
the
procession
like
a
butterfly
not
definitely
engaged
in
travelling
yet
somehow
chiming
in
at
points
with
the
general
progress
the
vicar
explained
things
as
he
went
on
the
fact
is
smith
i
didn
t
want
this
bother
of
church
restoration
at
all
but
it
was
necessary
to
do
something
in
on
account
of
those
d
dissenters
i
use
the
word
in
its
scriptural
meaning
of
course
not
as
an
how
very
odd
said
stephen
with
the
concern
demanded
of
serious
friendliness
odd
that
s
nothing
to
how
it
is
in
the
parish
of
twinkley
both
the
churchwardens
are
there
i
won
t
say
what
they
are
and
the
clerk
and
the
sexton
as
how
very
strange
said
stephen
strange
my
dear
sir
that
s
nothing
to
how
it
is
in
the
parish
of
sinnerton
however
as
to
our
own
parish
i
hope
we
shall
make
some
progress
you
must
trust
to
there
are
no
circumstances
to
trust
to
we
may
as
well
trust
in
providence
if
we
trust
at
all
but
here
we
are
a
wild
place
isn
t
it
but
i
like
it
on
such
days
as
the
churchyard
was
entered
on
this
side
by
a
stone
stile
over
which
having
clambered
you
remained
still
on
the
wild
hill
the
within
not
being
so
divided
from
the
without
as
to
obliterate
the
sense
of
open
freedom
a
delightful
place
to
be
buried
in
postulating
that
delight
can
accompany
a
man
to
his
tomb
under
any
circumstances
there
was
nothing
horrible
in
this
churchyard
in
the
shape
of
tight
mounds
bonded
with
sticks
which
shout
imprisonment
in
the
ears
rather
than
whisper
rest
or
trim
which
only
raise
images
of
people
in
new
black
crape
and
white
handkerchiefs
coming
to
tend
them
or
which
remind
us
of
hearses
and
mourning
coaches
or
which
make
a
parade
of
sorrow
or
and
bones
lying
behind
trees
showing
that
we
are
only
leaseholders
of
our
graves
no
nothing
but
long
wild
untutored
grass
diversifying
the
forms
of
the
mounds
it
covered
themselves
irregularly
shaped
with
no
eye
to
effect
the
impressive
presence
of
the
old
mountain
that
all
this
was
a
part
of
being
nowhere
excluded
by
disguising
art
outside
were
similar
slopes
and
similar
grass
and
then
the
serene
impassive
sea
visible
to
a
width
of
half
the
horizon
and
meeting
the
eye
with
the
effect
of
a
vast
concave
like
the
interior
of
a
blue
vessel
detached
rocks
stood
upright
afar
a
collar
of
foam
girding
their
bases
and
repeating
in
its
whiteness
the
plumage
of
a
countless
multitude
of
gulls
that
restlessly
hovered
about
now
worm
said
swancourt
sharply
and
worm
started
into
an
attitude
of
attention
at
once
to
receive
orders
stephen
and
himself
were
then
left
in
possession
and
the
work
went
on
till
early
in
the
afternoon
when
dinner
was
announced
by
unity
of
the
vicarage
kitchen
running
up
the
hill
without
a
bonnet
elfride
did
not
make
her
appearance
inside
the
building
till
late
in
the
afternoon
and
came
then
by
special
invitation
from
stephen
during
dinner
she
looked
so
intensely
living
and
full
of
movement
as
she
came
into
the
old
silent
place
that
young
smith
s
world
began
to
be
lit
by
the
purple
light
in
all
its
definiteness
worm
was
got
rid
of
by
sending
him
to
measure
the
height
of
the
tower
what
could
she
do
but
come
close
so
close
that
a
minute
arc
of
her
skirt
touched
his
foot
and
asked
him
how
he
was
getting
on
with
his
sketches
and
set
herself
to
learn
the
principles
of
practical
mensuration
as
applied
to
irregular
buildings
then
she
must
ascend
the
pulpit
to
for
the
hundredth
time
how
it
would
seem
to
be
a
preacher
presently
she
leant
over
the
front
of
the
pulpit
don
t
you
tell
papa
will
you
smith
if
i
tell
you
something
she
said
with
a
sudden
impulse
to
make
a
confidence
oh
no
that
i
won
t
said
he
staring
up
well
i
write
papa
s
sermons
for
him
very
often
and
he
preaches
them
better
than
he
does
his
own
and
then
afterwards
he
talks
to
people
and
to
me
about
what
he
said
in
his
sermon
and
forgets
that
i
wrote
it
for
him
isn
t
it
absurd
how
clever
you
must
be
said
stephen
i
couldn
t
write
a
sermon
for
the
oh
it
s
easy
enough
she
said
descending
from
the
pulpit
and
coming
close
to
him
to
explain
more
vividly
you
do
it
like
this
did
you
ever
play
a
game
of
forfeits
called
when
is
it
where
is
it
what
is
it
no
ah
that
s
a
pity
because
writing
a
sermon
is
very
much
like
playing
that
game
you
take
the
text
you
think
why
is
it
what
is
it
and
so
on
you
put
that
down
under
then
you
proceed
to
the
first
secondly
and
thirdly
papa
won
t
have
fourthlys
says
they
are
all
my
eye
then
you
have
a
final
collectively
several
pages
of
this
being
put
in
great
black
brackets
writing
opposite
leave
this
out
if
the
farmers
are
falling
then
comes
your
in
conclusion
then
a
few
words
and
i
have
done
well
all
this
time
you
have
put
on
the
back
of
each
page
keep
your
voice
down
i
mean
she
added
correcting
herself
that
s
how
i
do
in
papa
s
because
otherwise
he
gets
louder
and
louder
till
at
last
he
shouts
like
a
farmer
up
oh
papa
is
so
funny
in
some
things
then
after
this
childish
burst
of
confidence
she
was
frightened
as
if
warned
by
womanly
instinct
which
for
the
moment
her
ardour
had
outrun
that
she
had
been
too
forward
to
a
comparative
stranger
elfride
saw
her
father
then
and
went
away
into
the
wind
being
caught
by
a
gust
as
she
ascended
the
churchyard
slope
in
which
gust
she
had
the
motions
without
the
motives
of
a
hoiden
the
grace
without
the
of
a
pirouetter
she
conversed
for
a
minute
or
two
with
her
father
and
proceeded
homeward
swancourt
coming
on
to
the
church
to
stephen
the
wind
had
freshened
his
warm
complexion
as
it
freshens
the
glow
of
a
brand
he
was
in
a
mood
of
jollity
and
watched
elfride
down
the
hill
with
a
smile
you
little
flyaway
you
look
wild
enough
now
he
said
and
turned
to
stephen
but
she
s
not
a
wild
child
at
all
smith
as
steady
as
you
and
that
you
are
steady
i
see
from
your
diligence
i
think
miss
swancourt
very
clever
stephen
observed
yes
she
is
certainly
she
is
said
papa
turning
his
voice
as
much
as
possible
to
the
neutral
tone
of
disinterested
criticism
now
smith
i
ll
tell
you
something
but
she
mustn
t
know
it
for
the
world
not
for
the
world
mind
for
she
insists
upon
keeping
it
a
dead
secret
why
she
writes
my
sermons
for
me
often
and
a
very
good
job
she
makes
of
them
she
can
do
she
can
do
that
the
little
rascal
has
the
very
trick
of
the
trade
but
mind
you
smith
not
a
word
about
it
to
her
not
a
single
word
not
a
word
said
smith
look
there
said
swancourt
what
do
you
think
of
my
roofing
he
pointed
with
his
at
the
chancel
roof
did
you
do
that
sir
yes
i
worked
in
all
the
time
that
was
going
on
i
pulled
down
the
old
rafters
fixed
the
new
ones
put
on
the
battens
slated
the
roof
all
with
my
own
hands
worm
being
my
assistant
we
worked
like
slaves
didn
t
we
worm
ay
sure
we
did
harder
than
some
here
and
there
hee
hee
said
william
worm
cropping
up
from
somewhere
like
slaves

b
lieve

t
so
bad
to
cuss
and
keep
it
in
as
to
cuss
and
let
it
out
is
it
sir
well
why
because
you
sir
when
ye
were
on
the
roof
only
used
to
cuss
in
your
mind
which
is
i
suppose
no
harm
at
i
don
t
think
you
know
what
goes
on
in
my
mind
oh
doan

i
sir
hee
hee
maybe

but
a
poor
wambling
thing
sir
and

read
much
but
i
can
spell
as
well
as
some
here
and
there
doan
t
ye
mind
sir
that
blustrous
night
when
ye
asked
me
to
hold
the
candle
to
ye
in
yer
workshop
when
you
were
making
a
new
chair
for
the
chancel
yes
what
of
that
i
stood
with
the
candle
and
you
said
you
liked
company
if
twas
only
a
dog
or
cat
maning
me
and
the
chair
wouldn
t
do
ah
i
no
the
chair
wouldn
t
do
nohow
a
was
very
well
to
look
at
but
lord
worm
how
often
have
i
corrected
you
for
irreverent
speaking
a
was
very
well
to
look
at
but
you
couldn
t
sit
in
the
chair
nohow
twas
all
wi
the
chair
like
the
letter
z
directly
you
sat
down
upon
the
chair
get
up
worm
says
you
when
you
seed
the
chair
go
all
wi
me
up
you
took
the
chair
and
flung
en
like
fire
and
brimstone
to
t
other
end
of
your
shop
all
in
a
passion
damn
the
chair
says
i
just
what
i
was
thinking
says
you
sir
i
could
see
it
in
your
face
sir
says
i
and
i
hope
you
and
god
will
forgi
e
me
for
saying
what
you
wouldn
to
save
your
life
you
couldn
t
help
laughing
sir
at
a
poor
wambler
reading
your
thoughts
so
plain
ay
i
m
as
wise
as
one
here
and
i
thought
you
had
better
have
a
practical
man
to
go
over
the
church
and
tower
with
you
swancourt
said
to
stephen
the
following
morning
so
i
got
lord
luxellian
s
permission
to
send
for
a
man
when
you
came
i
told
him
to
be
there
at
ten
o
clock
he
s
a
very
intelligent
man
and
he
will
tell
you
all
you
want
to
know
about
the
state
of
the
walls
his
name
is
john
elfride
did
not
like
to
be
seen
again
at
the
church
with
stephen
i
will
watch
here
for
your
appearance
at
the
top
of
the
tower
she
said
laughingly
i
shall
see
your
figure
against
the
and
when
i
am
up
there
i
ll
wave
my
handkerchief
to
you
miss
swancourt
said
stephen
in
twelve
minutes
from
this
present
moment
he
added
looking
at
his
watch
i
ll
be
at
the
summit
and
look
out
for
she
went
round
to
the
corner
of
the
shrubbery
whence
she
could
watch
him
down
the
slope
leading
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
which
the
church
stood
there
she
saw
waiting
for
him
a
white
spot
a
mason
in
his
working
clothes
stephen
met
this
man
and
stopped
to
her
surprise
instead
of
their
moving
on
to
the
churchyard
they
both
leisurely
sat
down
upon
a
stone
close
by
their
and
remained
as
if
in
deep
conversation
elfride
looked
at
the
time
nine
of
the
twelve
minutes
had
passed
and
stephen
showed
no
signs
of
moving
more
minutes
passed
she
grew
cold
with
waiting
and
shivered
it
was
not
till
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
that
they
began
to
slowly
wend
up
the
hill
at
a
snail
s
pace
rude
and
unmannerly
she
said
to
herself
colouring
with
pique
anybody
would
think
he
was
in
love
with
that
horrid
mason
instead
of
with
the
sentence
remained
unspoken
though
not
unthought
she
returned
to
the
porch
is
the
man
you
sent
for
a
lazy
kind
of
man
she
inquired
of
her
father
no
he
said
surprised
quite
the
reverse
he
is
lord
luxellian
s
john
oh
said
elfride
indifferently
and
returned
towards
her
bleak
station
and
waited
and
shivered
again
it
was
a
trifle
after
all
a
childish
thing
looking
out
from
a
tower
and
waving
a
handkerchief
but
her
new
friend
had
promised
and
why
should
he
tease
her
so
the
effect
of
a
blow
is
as
proportionate
to
the
texture
of
the
object
struck
as
to
its
own
momentum
and
she
had
such
a
superlative
capacity
for
being
wounded
that
little
hits
struck
her
hard
it
was
not
till
the
end
of
half
an
hour
that
two
figures
were
seen
above
the
parapet
of
the
dreary
old
pile
motionless
as
bitterns
on
a
ruined
mosque
even
then
stephen
was
not
true
enough
to
perform
what
he
was
so
courteous
to
promise
and
he
vanished
without
making
a
sign
he
returned
at
midday
elfride
looked
vexed
when
unconscious
that
his
eyes
were
upon
her
when
conscious
severe
however
her
attitude
of
coldness
had
long
outlived
the
coldness
itself
and
she
could
no
longer
utter
feigned
words
of
indifference
ah
you
weren
t
kind
to
keep
me
waiting
in
the
cold
and
break
your
promise
she
said
at
last
reproachfully
in
tones
too
low
for
her
father
s
powers
of
hearing
forgive
forgive
me
said
stephen
with
dismay
i
had
forgotten
quite
forgotten
something
prevented
my
any
further
explanation
said
miss
capricious
pouting
he
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
and
looked
askance
none
he
said
with
the
accent
of
one
who
concealed
a
sin
chapter
v
bosom
d
high
in
tufted
it
was
breakfast
time
as
seen
from
the
vicarage
which
took
a
warm
tone
of
light
from
the
fire
the
weather
and
scene
outside
seemed
to
have
stereotyped
themselves
in
unrelieved
shades
of
gray
the
trees
and
shrubs
of
juniper
cedar
and
pine
varieties
were
grayish
black
those
of
the
sort
together
with
the
herbage
were
the
eternal
hills
and
tower
behind
them
were
the
sky
dropping
behind
all
gray
of
the
purest
melancholy
yet
in
spite
of
this
sombre
artistic
effect
the
morning
was
not
one
which
tended
to
lower
the
spirits
it
was
even
cheering
for
it
did
not
rain
nor
was
rain
likely
to
fall
for
many
days
to
come
elfride
had
turned
from
the
table
towards
the
fire
and
was
idly
elevating
a
before
her
face
when
she
heard
the
click
of
a
little
gate
outside
ah
here
s
the
postman
she
said
as
a
shuffling
active
man
came
through
an
opening
in
the
shrubbery
and
across
the
lawn
she
vanished
and
met
him
in
the
porch
afterwards
coming
in
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
how
many
are
there
three
for
papa
one
for
smith
none
for
miss
swancourt
and
papa
look
here
one
of
yours
is
from
whom
do
you
think
lord
luxellian
and
it
has
something
hard
in
it
a
lump
of
something
i
ve
been
feeling
it
through
the
envelope
and
can
t
think
what
it
what
does
luxellian
write
for
i
wonder
swancourt
had
said
simultaneously
with
her
words
he
handed
stephen
his
letter
and
took
his
own
putting
on
his
countenance
a
higher
class
of
look
than
was
customary
as
became
a
poor
gentleman
who
was
going
to
read
a
letter
from
a
peer
stephen
read
his
missive
with
a
countenance
quite
the
reverse
of
the
vicar
s
percy
place
thursday
evening
dear
smith
old
is
in
a
towering
rage
with
you
for
being
so
long
about
the
church
sketches
swears
you
are
more
trouble
than
you
are
worth
he
says
i
am
to
write
and
say
you
are
to
stay
no
longer
on
any
consideration
that
he
would
have
done
it
all
in
three
hours
very
easily
i
told
him
that
you
were
not
like
an
experienced
hand
which
he
seemed
to
forget
but
it
did
not
make
much
difference
however
between
you
and
me
privately
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
alarm
myself
for
a
day
or
so
if
i
were
not
inclined
to
return
i
would
make
out
the
week
and
finish
my
spree
he
will
blow
up
just
as
much
if
you
appear
here
on
saturday
as
if
you
keep
away
till
monday
yours
very
truly
simpkins
jenkins
dear
me
very
awkward
said
stephen
rather
en
l
air
and
confused
with
the
kind
of
confusion
that
assails
an
understrapper
when
he
has
been
enlarged
by
accident
to
the
dimensions
of
a
superior
and
is
somewhat
rudely
pared
down
to
his
original
size
what
is
awkward
said
miss
swancourt
smith
by
this
time
recovered
his
equanimity
and
with
it
the
professional
dignity
of
an
experienced
architect
important
business
demands
my
immediate
presence
in
london
i
regret
to
say
he
replied
what
must
you
go
at
once
said
swancourt
looking
over
the
edge
of
his
letter
important
business
a
young
fellow
like
you
to
have
important
business
the
truth
is
said
stephen
blushing
and
rather
ashamed
of
having
pretended
even
so
slightly
to
a
consequence
which
did
not
belong
to
him
the
truth
is
hewby
has
sent
to
say
i
am
to
come
home
and
i
must
obey
i
see
i
see
it
is
politic
to
do
so
you
mean
now
i
can
see
more
than
you
think
you
are
to
be
his
partner
i
booked
you
for
that
directly
i
read
his
letter
to
me
the
other
day
and
the
way
he
spoke
of
you
he
thinks
a
great
deal
of
you
smith
or
he
wouldn
t
be
so
anxious
for
your
unpleasant
to
stephen
such
remarks
as
these
could
not
sound
to
have
the
expectancy
of
partnership
with
one
of
the
architects
in
london
thrust
upon
him
was
cheering
however
untenable
he
felt
the
idea
to
be
he
saw
that
whatever
hewby
might
think
swancourt
certainly
thought
much
of
him
to
entertain
such
an
idea
on
such
slender
ground
as
to
be
absolutely
no
ground
at
all
and
then
unaccountably
his
speaking
face
exhibited
a
cloud
of
sadness
which
a
reflection
on
the
remoteness
of
any
such
contingency
could
hardly
have
sufficed
to
cause
elfride
was
struck
with
that
look
of
his
even
swancourt
noticed
it
well
he
said
cheerfully
never
mind
that
now
you
must
come
again
on
your
own
account
not
on
business
come
to

they

then
you

so
i
am
glad
to
get
somebody
decent
to

or

this
outlandish
ultima
thule
but
by
the
bye
i
have
something
to
say
you
won
t
go
no
i
need
not
said
stephen
hesitatingly
i
am
not
obliged
to
get
back
before
monday
very
well
then
that
brings
me
to
what
i
am
going
to
propose
this
is
a
letter
from
lord
luxellian
i
think
you
heard
me
speak
of
him
as
the
resident
landowner
in
this
district
and
patron
of
this
living
i
know
of
he
is
in
london
now
it
seems
that
he
has
run
up
on
business
for
a
day
or
two
and
taken
lady
luxellian
with
him
he
has
written
to
ask
me
to
go
to
his
house
and
search
for
a
paper
among
his
private
memoranda
which
he
forgot
to
take
with
what
did
he
send
in
the
letter
inquired
elfride
the
key
of
a
private
desk
in
which
the
papers
are
he
doesn
t
like
to
trust
such
a
matter
to
any
body
else
i
have
done
such
things
for
him
before
and
what
i
propose
is
that
we
make
an
afternoon
of
it
all
three
of
us
go
for
a
drive
to
targan
bay
come
home
by
way
of
endelstow
house
and
whilst
i
am
looking
over
the
documents
you
can
ramble
about
the
rooms
where
you
like
i
have
the
run
of
the
house
at
any
time
you
know
the
building
though
nothing
but
a
mass
of
gables
outside
has
a
splendid
hall
staircase
and
gallery
within
and
there
are
a
few
good
yes
there
are
said
stephen
have
you
seen
the
place
then
i
saw
it
as
i
came
by
he
said
hastily
oh
yes
but
i
was
alluding
to
the
interior
and
the
church
eval
s
is
much
older
than
our
agnes
here
i
do
duty
in
that
and
this
alternately
you
know
the
fact
is
i
ought
to
have
some
help
riding
across
that
park
for
two
miles
on
a
wet
morning
is
not
at
all
the
thing
if
my
constitution
were
not
well
seasoned
as
thank
god
it
is
here
swancourt
looked
down
his
front
as
if
his
constitution
were
visible
there
i
should
be
coughing
and
barking
all
the
year
round
and
when
the
family
goes
away
there
are
only
about
three
servants
to
preach
to
when
i
get
there
well
that
shall
be
the
arrangement
then
elfride
you
will
like
to
go
elfride
assented
and
the
little
separated
stephen
rose
to
go
and
take
a
few
final
measurements
at
the
church
the
vicar
following
him
to
the
door
with
a
mysterious
expression
of
inquiry
on
his
face
you
ll
put
up
with
our
not
having
family
prayer
this
morning
i
hope
he
whispered
yes
quite
so
said
stephen
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
continued
in
the
same
undertone
we
don
t
make
a
regular
thing
of
it
but
when
we
have
strangers
visiting
us
i
am
strongly
of
opinion
that
it
is
the
proper
thing
to
do
and
i
always
do
it
i
am
very
strict
on
that
point
but
you
smith
there
is
something
in
your
face
which
makes
me
feel
quite
at
home
no
nonsense
about
you
in
short
ah
it
reminds
me
of
a
splendid
story
i
used
to
hear
when
i
was
a
young
fellow
such
a
story
but
here
the
vicar
shook
his
head
and
grimly
laughed
was
it
a
good
story
said
young
smith
smiling
too
oh
yes
but
tis
too
bad
too
bad
couldn
t
tell
it
to
you
for
the
world
stephen
went
across
the
lawn
hearing
the
vicar
chuckling
privately
at
the
recollection
as
he
withdrew
they
started
at
three
o
clock
the
gray
morning
had
resolved
itself
into
an
afternoon
bright
with
a
pale
pervasive
sunlight
without
the
sun
itself
being
visible
lightly
they
trotted
along
the
wheels
nearly
silent
the
horse
s
hoofs
clapping
almost
ringing
upon
the
hard
white
turnpike
road
as
it
followed
the
level
ridge
in
a
perfectly
straight
line
seeming
to
be
absorbed
ultimately
by
the
white
of
the
sky
targan
bay
which
had
the
merit
of
being
easily
got
at
was
duly
visited
they
then
swept
round
by
innumerable
lanes
in
which
not
twenty
consecutive
yards
were
either
straight
or
level
to
the
domain
of
lord
luxellian
a
woman
with
a
double
chin
and
thick
neck
like
queen
anne
by
dahl
threw
open
the
lodge
gate
a
little
boy
standing
behind
her
i
ll
give
him
something
poor
little
fellow
said
elfride
pulling
out
her
purse
and
hastily
opening
it
from
the
interior
of
her
purse
a
host
of
bits
of
paper
like
a
flock
of
white
birds
floated
into
the
air
and
were
blown
about
in
all
directions
well
to
be
sure
said
stephen
with
a
slight
laugh
what
the
dickens
is
all
that
said
swancourt
not
halves
of
elfride
elfride
looked
annoyed
and
guilty
they
are
only
something
of
mine
papa
she
faltered
whilst
stephen
leapt
out
and
assisted
by
the
s
little
boy
crept
about
round
the
wheels
and
horse
s
hoofs
till
the
papers
were
all
gathered
together
again
he
handed
them
back
to
her
and
remounted
i
suppose
you
are
wondering
what
those
scraps
were
she
said
as
they
bowled
along
up
the
sycamore
avenue
and
so
i
may
as
well
tell
you
they
are
notes
for
a
romance
i
am
she
could
not
help
colouring
at
the
confession
much
as
she
tried
to
avoid
it
a
story
do
you
mean
said
stephen
swancourt
half
listening
and
catching
a
word
of
the
conversation
now
and
then
yes
the
court
of
kellyon
castle
a
romance
of
the
fifteenth
century
such
writing
is
out
of
date
now
i
know
but
i
like
doing
a
romance
carried
in
a
purse
if
a
highwayman
were
to
rob
you
he
would
be
taken
yes
that
s
my
way
of
carrying
manuscript
the
real
reason
is
that
i
mostly
write
bits
of
it
on
scraps
of
paper
when
i
am
on
horseback
and
i
put
them
there
for
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
your
romance
when
you
have
written
it
said
stephen
i
don
t
know
she
replied
and
turned
her
head
to
look
at
the
prospect
for
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
precincts
of
endelstow
house
driving
through
an
ancient
of
stone
spanned
by
the
tudor
arch
they
found
themselves
in
a
spacious
court
closed
by
a
facade
on
each
of
its
three
sides
the
substantial
portions
of
the
existing
building
dated
from
the
reign
of
henry
viii
but
the
picturesque
and
sheltered
spot
had
been
the
site
of
an
erection
of
a
much
earlier
date
a
licence
to
crenellate
mansum
infra
manerium
suum
was
granted
by
edward
ii
to
hugo
luxellen
chivaler
but
though
the
faint
outline
of
the
ditch
and
mound
was
visible
at
points
no
sign
of
the
original
building
remained
the
windows
on
all
sides
were
long
and
the
roof
lines
broken
up
by
dormer
lights
of
the
same
pattern
the
apex
stones
of
these
dormers
together
with
those
of
the
gables
were
surmounted
by
grotesque
figures
in
rampant
passant
and
couchant
variety
tall
octagonal
and
twisted
chimneys
thrust
themselves
high
up
into
the
sky
surpassed
in
height
however
by
some
poplars
and
sycamores
at
the
back
which
showed
their
gently
rocking
summits
over
ridge
and
parapet
in
the
corners
of
the
court
polygonal
bays
whose
surfaces
were
entirely
occupied
by
buttresses
and
windows
broke
into
the
squareness
of
the
enclosure
and
a
oriel
springing
from
a
fantastic
series
of
mouldings
overhung
the
archway
of
the
chief
entrance
to
the
house
as
swancourt
had
remarked
he
had
the
freedom
of
the
mansion
in
the
absence
of
its
owner
upon
a
statement
of
his
errand
they
were
all
admitted
to
the
library
and
left
entirely
to
themselves
swancourt
was
soon
up
to
his
eyes
in
the
examination
of
a
heap
of
papers
he
had
taken
from
the
cabinet
described
by
his
correspondent
stephen
and
elfride
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
wander
about
till
her
father
was
ready
elfride
entered
the
gallery
and
stephen
followed
her
without
seeming
to
do
so
it
was
a
long
sombre
apartment
enriched
with
fittings
a
century
or
so
later
in
style
than
the
walls
of
the
mansion
pilasters
of
renaissance
workmanship
supported
a
cornice
from
which
sprang
a
curved
ceiling
panelled
in
the
awkward
twists
and
curls
of
the
period
the
old
gothic
quarries
still
remained
in
the
upper
portion
of
the
large
window
at
the
end
though
they
had
made
way
for
a
more
modern
form
of
glazing
elsewhere
stephen
was
at
one
end
of
the
gallery
looking
towards
elfride
who
stood
in
the
midst
beginning
to
feel
somewhat
depressed
by
the
society
of
luxellian
shades
of
cadaverous
complexion
fixed
by
holbein
kneller
and
lely
and
seeming
to
gaze
at
and
through
her
in
a
moralizing
mood
the
silence
which
cast
almost
a
spell
upon
them
was
broken
by
the
sudden
opening
of
a
door
at
the
far
end
out
bounded
a
pair
of
little
girls
lightly
yet
warmly
dressed
their
eyes
were
sparkling
their
hair
swinging
about
and
around
their
red
mouths
laughing
with
unalloyed
gladness
ah
miss
swancourt
dearest
elfie
we
heard
you
are
you
going
to
stay
here
you
are
our
little
mamma
are
you
not
our
big
mamma
is
gone
to
london
said
one
let
me
tiss
you
said
the
other
in
appearance
very
much
like
the
first
but
to
a
smaller
pattern
their
pink
cheeks
and
yellow
hair
were
speedily
intermingled
with
the
folds
of
elfride
s
dress
she
then
stooped
and
tenderly
embraced
them
both
such
an
odd
thing
said
elfride
smiling
and
turning
to
stephen
they
have
taken
it
into
their
heads
lately
to
call
me
little
mamma
because
i
am
very
fond
of
them
and
wore
a
dress
the
other
day
something
like
one
of
lady
luxellian
these
two
young
creatures
were
the
honourable
mary
and
the
honourable
kate
scarcely
appearing
large
enough
as
yet
to
bear
the
weight
of
such
ponderous
prefixes
they
were
the
only
two
children
of
lord
and
lady
luxellian
and
as
it
proved
had
been
left
at
home
during
their
parents
temporary
absence
in
the
custody
of
nurse
and
governess
lord
luxellian
was
dotingly
fond
of
the
children
rather
indifferent
towards
his
wife
since
she
had
begun
to
show
an
inclination
not
to
please
him
by
giving
him
a
boy
all
children
instinctively
ran
after
elfride
looking
upon
her
more
as
an
unusually
nice
large
specimen
of
their
own
tribe
than
as
a
elder
it
had
now
become
an
established
rule
that
whenever
she
met
them
indoors
or
weekdays
or
sundays
they
were
to
be
severally
pressed
against
her
face
and
bosom
for
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
a
minute
and
made
much
of
on
the
delightful
system
of
cumulative
epithet
and
caress
to
which
unpractised
girls
will
occasionally
abandon
themselves
a
look
of
misgiving
by
the
youngsters
towards
the
door
by
which
they
had
entered
directed
attention
to
a
appearing
from
the
same
quarter
to
put
an
end
to
this
sweet
freedom
of
the
poor
honourables
mary
and
kate
i
wish
you
lived
here
miss
swancourt
piped
one
like
a
melancholy
bullfinch
so
do
i
piped
the
other
like
a
rather
more
melancholy
bullfinch
mamma
can
t
play
with
us
so
nicely
as
you
do
i
don
t
think
she
ever
learnt
playing
when
she
was
little
when
shall
we
come
to
see
you
as
soon
as
you
like
and
sleep
at
your
house
all
night
that
s
what
i
mean
by
coming
to
see
you
i
don
t
care
to
see
people
with
hats
and
bonnets
on
and
all
standing
up
and
walking
as
soon
as
we
can
get
mamma
s
permission
you
shall
come
and
stay
as
long
as
ever
you
like
the
prisoners
were
then
led
off
elfride
again
turning
her
attention
to
her
guest
whom
she
had
left
standing
at
the
remote
end
of
the
gallery
on
looking
around
for
him
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
elfride
stepped
down
to
the
library
thinking
he
might
have
rejoined
her
father
there
but
swancourt
now
cheerfully
illuminated
by
a
pair
of
candles
was
still
alone
untying
packets
of
letters
and
papers
and
tying
them
up
again
as
elfride
did
not
stand
on
a
sufficiently
intimate
footing
with
the
object
of
her
interest
to
justify
her
as
a
proper
young
lady
to
commence
the
active
search
for
him
that
youthful
impulsiveness
prompted
and
as
nevertheless
for
a
nascent
reason
connected
with
those
divinely
cut
lips
of
his
she
did
not
like
him
to
be
absent
from
her
side
she
wandered
desultorily
back
to
the
oak
staircase
pouting
and
casting
her
eyes
about
in
hope
of
discerning
his
boyish
figure
though
daylight
still
prevailed
in
the
rooms
the
corridors
were
in
a
depth
of
shadow
chill
sad
and
silent
and
it
was
only
by
looking
along
them
towards
light
spaces
beyond
that
anything
or
anybody
could
be
discerned
therein
one
of
these
light
spots
she
found
to
be
caused
by
a
with
glass
panels
in
the
upper
part
elfride
opened
it
and
found
herself
confronting
a
secondary
or
inner
lawn
separated
from
the
principal
lawn
front
by
a
shrubbery
and
now
she
saw
a
perplexing
sight
at
right
angles
to
the
face
of
the
wing
she
had
emerged
from
and
within
a
few
feet
of
the
door
jutted
out
another
wing
of
the
mansion
lower
and
with
less
architectural
character
immediately
opposite
to
her
in
the
wall
of
this
wing
was
a
large
broad
window
having
its
blind
drawn
down
and
illuminated
by
a
light
in
the
room
it
screened
on
the
blind
was
a
shadow
from
somebody
close
inside
it
a
person
in
profile
the
profile
was
unmistakably
that
of
stephen
it
was
just
possible
to
see
that
his
arms
were
uplifted
and
that
his
hands
held
an
article
of
some
kind
then
another
shadow
appeared
also
in
profile
and
came
close
to
him
this
was
the
shadow
of
a
woman
she
turned
her
back
towards
stephen
he
lifted
and
held
out
what
now
proved
to
be
a
shawl
or
mantle
placed
it
carefully
so
carefully
round
the
lady
disappeared
reappeared
in
her
front
fastened
the
mantle
did
he
then
kiss
her
surely
not
yet
the
motion
might
have
been
a
kiss
then
both
shadows
swelled
to
colossal
dimensions
grew
distorted
vanished
two
minutes
elapsed
ah
miss
swancourt
i
am
so
glad
to
find
you
i
was
looking
for
you
said
a
voice
at
her
elbow
stephen
s
voice
she
stepped
into
the
passage
do
you
know
any
of
the
members
of
this
establishment
said
she
not
a
single
one
how
should
i
he
replied
chapter
vi
fare
thee
weel
awhile
simultaneously
with
the
conclusion
of
stephen
s
remark
the
sound
of
the
closing
of
an
external
door
in
their
immediate
neighbourhood
reached
elfride
s
ears
it
came
from
the
further
side
of
the
wing
containing
the
illuminated
room
she
then
discerned
by
the
aid
of
the
dusky
departing
light
a
figure
whose
sex
was
undistinguishable
walking
down
the
gravelled
path
by
the
parterre
towards
the
river
the
figure
grew
fainter
and
vanished
under
the
trees
swancourt
s
voice
was
heard
calling
out
their
names
from
a
distant
corridor
in
the
body
of
the
building
they
retraced
their
steps
and
found
him
with
his
coat
buttoned
up
and
his
hat
on
awaiting
their
advent
in
a
mood
of
at
having
brought
his
search
to
a
successful
close
the
carriage
was
brought
round
and
without
further
delay
the
trio
drove
away
from
the
mansion
under
the
echoing
gateway
arch
and
along
by
the
leafless
sycamores
as
the
stars
began
to
kindle
their
trembling
lights
behind
the
maze
of
branches
and
twigs
no
words
were
spoken
either
by
youth
or
maiden
her
unpractised
mind
was
completely
occupied
in
fathoming
its
recent
acquisition
the
young
man
who
had
inspired
her
with
such
novelty
of
feeling
who
had
come
directly
from
london
on
business
to
her
father
having
been
brought
by
chance
to
endelstow
house
had
by
some
means
or
other
acquired
the
privilege
of
approaching
some
lady
he
had
found
therein
and
of
honouring
her
by
petits
soins
of
a
marked
kind
all
in
the
space
of
half
an
hour
what
room
were
they
standing
in
thought
elfride
as
nearly
as
she
could
guess
it
was
lord
luxellian
s
or
office
what
people
were
in
the
house
none
but
the
governess
and
servants
as
far
as
she
knew
and
of
these
he
had
professed
a
total
ignorance
had
the
person
she
had
indistinctly
seen
leaving
the
house
anything
to
do
with
the
performance
it
was
impossible
to
say
without
appealing
to
the
culprit
himself
and
that
she
would
never
do
the
more
elfride
reflected
the
more
certain
did
it
appear
that
the
meeting
was
a
chance
rencounter
and
not
an
appointment
on
the
ultimate
inquiry
as
to
the
individuality
of
the
woman
elfride
at
once
assumed
that
she
could
not
be
an
inferior
stephen
smith
was
not
the
man
to
care
about
with
women
beneath
him
though
gentle
ambition
was
visible
in
his
kindling
eyes
he
evidently
hoped
for
much
hoped
indefinitely
but
extensively
elfride
was
puzzled
and
being
puzzled
was
by
a
natural
sequence
of
girlish
sensations
vexed
with
him
no
more
pleasure
came
in
recognizing
that
from
liking
to
attract
him
she
was
getting
on
to
love
him
boyish
as
he
was
and
innocent
as
he
had
seemed
they
reached
the
bridge
which
formed
a
link
between
the
eastern
and
western
halves
of
the
parish
situated
in
a
valley
that
was
bounded
outwardly
by
the
sea
it
formed
a
point
of
depression
from
which
the
road
ascended
with
great
steepness
to
west
endelstow
and
the
vicarage
there
was
no
absolute
necessity
for
either
of
them
to
alight
but
as
it
was
the
vicar
s
custom
after
a
long
journey
to
humour
the
horse
in
making
this
winding
ascent
elfride
moved
by
an
imitative
instinct
suddenly
jumped
out
when
pleasant
had
just
begun
to
adopt
the
deliberate
stalk
he
associated
with
this
portion
of
the
road
the
young
man
seemed
glad
of
any
excuse
for
breaking
the
silence
why
miss
swancourt
what
a
risky
thing
to
do
he
exclaimed
immediately
following
her
example
by
jumping
down
on
the
other
side
oh
no
not
at
all
replied
she
coldly
the
shadow
phenomenon
at
endelstow
house
still
paramount
within
her
stephen
walked
along
by
himself
for
two
or
three
minutes
wrapped
in
the
rigid
reserve
dictated
by
her
tone
then
apparently
thinking
that
it
was
only
for
girls
to
pout
he
came
serenely
round
to
her
side
and
offered
his
arm
with
castilian
gallantry
to
assist
her
in
ascending
the
remaining
of
the
steep
here
was
a
temptation
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
elfride
had
been
treated
as
a
woman
in
this
way
offered
an
arm
in
a
manner
implying
that
she
had
a
right
to
refuse
it
till
she
had
never
received
masculine
attentions
beyond
those
which
might
be
contained
in
such
homely
remarks
as
elfride
give
me
your
hand
elfride
take
hold
of
my
arm
from
her
father
her
callow
heart
made
an
epoch
of
the
incident
she
considered
her
array
of
feelings
for
and
against
collectively
they
were
for
taking
this
offered
arm
the
single
one
of
pique
determined
her
to
punish
stephen
by
refusing
no
thank
you
smith
i
can
get
along
better
by
myself
it
was
elfride
s
first
fragile
attempt
at
browbeating
a
lover
fearing
more
the
issue
of
such
an
undertaking
than
what
a
gentle
young
man
might
think
of
her
waywardness
she
immediately
afterwards
determined
to
please
herself
by
reversing
her
statement
on
second
thoughts
i
will
take
it
she
said
they
slowly
went
their
way
up
the
hill
a
few
yards
behind
the
carriage
how
silent
you
are
miss
swancourt
stephen
observed
perhaps
i
think
you
silent
too
she
returned
i
may
have
reason
to
scarcely
it
is
sadness
that
makes
people
silent
and
you
can
have
you
don
t
know
i
have
a
trouble
though
some
might
think
it
less
a
trouble
than
a
what
is
it
she
asked
impulsively
stephen
hesitated
i
might
tell
he
said
at
the
same
time
perhaps
it
is
as
well
she
let
go
his
arm
and
imperatively
pushed
it
from
her
tossing
her
head
she
had
just
learnt
that
a
good
deal
of
dignity
is
lost
by
asking
a
question
to
which
an
answer
is
refused
even
ever
so
politely
for
though
politeness
does
good
service
in
cases
of
requisition
and
compromise
it
but
little
helps
a
direct
refusal
i
don
t
wish
to
know
anything
of
it
i
don
t
wish
it
she
went
on
the
carriage
is
waiting
for
us
at
the
top
of
the
hill
we
must
get
in
and
elfride
flitted
to
the
front
papa
here
is
your
elfride
she
exclaimed
to
the
dusky
figure
of
the
old
gentleman
as
she
sprang
up
and
sank
by
his
side
without
deigning
to
accept
aid
from
stephen
ah
yes
uttered
the
vicar
in
artificially
alert
tones
awaking
from
a
most
profound
sleep
and
suddenly
preparing
to
alight
why
what
are
you
doing
papa
we
are
not
home
oh
no
no
of
course
not
we
are
not
at
home
yet
swancourt
said
very
hastily
endeavouring
to
dodge
back
to
his
original
position
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
not
moved
at
all
the
fact
is
i
was
so
lost
in
deep
meditation
that
i
forgot
whereabouts
we
and
in
a
minute
the
vicar
was
snoring
again
that
evening
being
the
last
seemed
to
throw
an
exceptional
shade
of
sadness
over
stephen
smith
and
the
repeated
injunctions
of
the
vicar
that
he
was
to
come
and
revisit
them
in
the
summer
apparently
tended
less
to
raise
his
spirits
than
to
unearth
some
misgiving
he
left
them
in
the
gray
light
of
dawn
whilst
the
colours
of
earth
were
sombre
and
the
sun
was
yet
hidden
in
the
east
elfride
had
fidgeted
all
night
in
her
little
bed
lest
none
of
the
household
should
be
awake
soon
enough
to
start
him
and
also
lest
she
might
miss
seeing
again
the
bright
eyes
and
curly
hair
to
which
their
owner
s
possession
of
a
hidden
mystery
added
a
deeper
tinge
of
romance
to
some
extent
so
soon
does
womanly
interest
take
a
solicitous
turn
she
felt
herself
responsible
for
his
safe
conduct
they
breakfasted
before
daylight
swancourt
being
more
and
more
taken
with
his
guest
s
ingenuous
appearance
having
determined
to
rise
early
and
bid
him
a
friendly
farewell
it
was
however
rather
to
the
vicar
s
astonishment
that
he
saw
elfride
walk
in
to
the
candle
in
hand
whilst
william
worm
performed
his
toilet
during
which
performance
the
inmates
of
the
vicarage
were
always
in
the
habit
of
waiting
with
exemplary
patience
elfride
wandered
desultorily
to
the
summer
house
stephen
followed
her
thither
the
valley
was
visible
from
this
position
a
mist
now
lying
all
along
its
length
hiding
the
stream
which
trickled
through
it
though
the
observers
themselves
were
in
clear
air
they
stood
close
together
leaning
over
the
rustic
balustrading
which
bounded
the
arbour
on
the
outward
side
and
formed
the
crest
of
a
steep
slope
beneath
elfride
constrainedly
pointed
out
some
features
of
the
distant
uplands
rising
irregularly
opposite
but
the
artistic
eye
was
either
from
nature
or
circumstance
very
faint
in
stephen
now
and
he
only
half
attended
to
her
description
as
if
he
spared
time
from
some
other
thought
going
on
within
him
well
he
said
suddenly
i
must
never
see
you
again
i
suppose
miss
swancourt
in
spite
of
his
genuine
tribulation
played
directly
upon
the
delicate
chords
of
her
nature
she
could
afford
to
forgive
him
for
a
concealment
or
two
moreover
the
shyness
which
would
not
allow
him
to
look
her
in
the
face
lent
bravery
to
her
own
eyes
and
tongue
oh
do
come
again
smith
she
said
prettily
i
should
delight
in
it
but
it
will
be
better
if
i
do
why
certain
circumstances
in
connection
with
me
make
it
undesirable
not
on
my
account
on
goodness
as
if
anything
in
connection
with
you
could
hurt
me
she
said
with
serene
supremacy
but
seeing
that
this
plan
of
treatment
was
inappropriate
she
tuned
a
smaller
note
ah
i
know
why
you
will
not
come
you
don
t
want
to
you
ll
go
home
to
london
and
to
all
the
stirring
people
there
and
will
never
want
to
see
us
any
more
you
know
i
have
no
such
and
go
on
writing
letters
to
the
lady
you
are
engaged
to
just
as
what
does
that
mean
i
am
not
you
wrote
a
letter
to
a
miss
somebody
i
saw
it
in
the
pooh
an
elderly
woman
who
keeps
a
stationer
s
shop
and
it
was
to
tell
her
to
keep
my
newspapers
till
i
get
you
needn
t
have
explained
it
was
not
my
business
at
miss
elfride
was
rather
relieved
to
hear
that
statement
nevertheless
and
you
won
t
come
again
to
see
my
father
she
insisted
i
should
like
to
and
to
see
you
again
but
will
you
reveal
to
me
that
matter
you
hide
she
interrupted
petulantly
no
not
she
could
not
but
go
on
graceless
as
it
might
seem
tell
me
this
she
importuned
with
a
trembling
mouth
does
any
meeting
of
yours
with
a
lady
at
endelstow
vicarage
clash
with
any
interest
you
may
take
in
me
he
started
a
little
it
does
not
he
said
emphatically
and
looked
into
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
with
the
confidence
that
only
honesty
can
give
and
even
that
to
youth
alone
the
explanation
had
not
come
but
a
gloom
left
her
she
could
not
but
believe
that
utterance
whatever
enigma
might
lie
in
the
shadow
on
the
blind
it
was
not
an
enigma
of
underhand
passion
she
turned
towards
the
house
entering
it
through
the
conservatory
stephen
went
round
to
the
front
door
swancourt
was
standing
on
the
step
in
his
slippers
worm
was
adjusting
a
buckle
in
the
harness
and
murmuring
about
his
poor
head
and
everything
was
ready
for
stephen
s
departure
you
named
august
for
your
visit
august
it
shall
be
that
is
if
you
care
for
the
society
of
such
a
fossilized
tory
said
swancourt
smith
only
responded
hesitatingly
that
he
should
like
to
come
again
you
said
you
would
and
you
must
insisted
elfride
coming
to
the
door
and
speaking
under
her
father
s
arm
whatever
reason
the
youth
may
have
had
for
not
wishing
to
enter
the
house
as
a
guest
it
no
longer
predominated
he
promised
and
bade
them
adieu
and
got
into
the
which
crept
up
the
slope
and
bore
him
out
of
their
sight
i
never
was
so
much
taken
with
anybody
in
my
life
as
i
am
with
that
young
fellow
never
i
can
not
understand
it
can
t
understand
it
anyhow
said
swancourt
quite
energetically
to
himself
and
went
indoors
chapter
vii
no
more
of
me
you
knew
my
love
stephen
smith
revisited
endelstow
vicarage
agreeably
to
his
promise
he
had
a
genuine
artistic
reason
for
coming
though
no
such
reason
seemed
to
be
required
old
seat
ends
of
exquisite
workmanship
were
rapidly
decaying
in
an
aisle
of
the
church
and
it
became
politic
to
make
drawings
of
their
contours
ere
they
were
battered
past
recognition
in
the
turmoil
of
the
restoration
he
entered
the
house
at
sunset
and
the
world
was
pleasant
again
to
the
two
ones
a
momentary
pang
of
disappointment
had
nevertheless
passed
through
elfride
when
she
casually
discovered
that
he
had
not
come
that
minute
from
london
but
had
reached
the
neighbourhood
the
previous
evening
surprise
would
have
accompanied
the
feeling
had
she
not
remembered
that
several
tourists
were
haunting
the
coast
at
this
season
and
that
stephen
might
have
chosen
to
do
likewise
they
did
little
besides
chat
that
evening
swancourt
beginning
to
question
his
visitor
closely
yet
paternally
and
in
good
part
on
his
hopes
and
prospects
from
the
profession
he
had
embraced
stephen
gave
vague
answers
the
next
day
it
rained
in
the
evening
when
hours
of
elfride
had
completely
rekindled
her
admirer
s
ardour
a
game
of
chess
was
proposed
between
them
the
game
had
its
value
in
helping
on
the
developments
of
their
future
elfride
soon
perceived
that
her
opponent
was
but
a
learner
she
next
noticed
that
he
had
a
very
odd
way
of
handling
the
pieces
when
castling
or
taking
a
man
antecedently
she
would
have
supposed
that
the
same
performance
must
be
gone
through
by
all
players
in
the
same
manner
she
was
taught
by
his
differing
action
that
all
ordinary
players
who
learn
the
game
by
sight
unconsciously
touch
the
men
in
a
stereotyped
way
this
impression
of
indescribable
oddness
in
stephen
s
touch
culminated
in
speech
when
she
saw
him
at
the
taking
of
one
of
her
bishops
push
it
aside
with
the
taking
man
instead
of
lifting
it
as
a
preliminary
to
the
move
how
strangely
you
handle
the
men
smith
do
i
i
am
sorry
for
oh
no
don
t
be
sorry
it
is
not
a
matter
great
enough
for
sorrow
but
who
taught
you
to
play
nobody
miss
swancourt
he
said
i
learnt
from
a
book
lent
me
by
my
friend
knight
the
noblest
man
in
the
but
you
have
seen
people
play
i
have
never
seen
the
playing
of
a
single
game
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
had
the
opportunity
of
playing
with
a
living
opponent
i
have
worked
out
many
games
from
books
and
studied
the
reasons
of
the
different
moves
but
that
is
this
was
a
full
explanation
of
his
mannerism
but
the
fact
that
a
man
with
the
desire
for
chess
should
have
grown
up
without
being
able
to
see
or
engage
in
a
game
astonished
her
not
a
little
she
pondered
on
the
circumstance
for
some
time
looking
into
vacancy
and
hindering
the
play
swancourt
was
sitting
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
board
but
apparently
thinking
of
other
things
half
to
himself
he
said
pending
the
move
of
elfride
quae
finis
aut
quod
me
manet
stipendium
stephen
replied
instantly
effare
jussas
cum
fide
poenas
excellent
prompt
gratifying
said
swancourt
with
feeling
bringing
down
his
hand
upon
the
table
and
making
three
pawns
and
a
knight
dance
over
their
borders
by
the
shaking
i
was
musing
on
those
words
as
applicable
to
a
strange
course
i
am
steering
but
enough
of
that
i
am
delighted
with
you
smith
for
it
is
so
seldom
in
this
desert
that
i
meet
with
a
man
who
is
gentleman
and
scholar
enough
to
continue
a
quotation
however
trite
it
may
i
also
apply
the
words
to
myself
said
stephen
quietly
you
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
do
that
i
should
have
come
murmured
elfride
poutingly
and
insinuating
herself
between
them
tell
me
all
about
it
come
construe
construe
stephen
looked
steadfastly
into
her
face
and
said
slowly
and
in
a
voice
full
of
a
meaning
that
seemed
quaintly
premature
in
one
so
young
quae

what
will
be
the
end

the
penalty
the
vicar
who
had
listened
with
a
critical
compression
of
the
lips
to
this
recitation
and
by
reason
of
his
imperfect
hearing
had
missed
the
marked
realism
of
stephen
s
tone
in
the
english
words
now
said
hesitatingly
by
the
bye
smith
i
know
you
ll
excuse
my
curiosity
though
your
translation
was
unexceptionably
correct
and
close
you
have
a
way
of
pronouncing
your
latin
which
to
me
seems
most
peculiar
not
that
the
pronunciation
of
a
dead
language
is
of
much
importance
yet
your
accents
and
quantities
have
a
grotesque
sound
to
my
ears
i
thought
first
that
you
had
acquired
your
way
of
breathing
the
vowels
from
some
of
the
northern
colleges
but
it
can
not
be
so
with
the
quantities
what
i
was
going
to
ask
was
if
your
instructor
in
the
classics
could
possibly
have
been
an
oxford
or
cambridge
man
yes
he
was
an
oxford
man
fellow
of
cyprian
really
oh
yes
there
s
no
doubt
about
it
the
oddest
thing
ever
i
heard
of
said
swancourt
starting
with
astonishment
that
the
pupil
of
such
a
man
the
best
and
cleverest
man
in
england
cried
stephen
enthusiastically
that
the
pupil
of
such
a
man
should
pronounce
latin
in
the
way
you
pronounce
it
beats
all
i
ever
heard
how
long
did
he
instruct
you
four
four
years
it
is
not
so
strange
when
i
explain
stephen
hastened
to
say
it
was
done
in
this
way
by
letter
i
sent
him
exercises
and
construing
twice
a
week
and
twice
a
week
he
sent
them
back
to
me
corrected
with
marginal
notes
of
instruction
that
is
how
i
learnt
my
latin
and
greek
such
as
it
is
he
is
not
responsible
for
my
scanning
he
has
never
heard
me
scan
a
a
novel
case
and
a
singular
instance
of
patience
cried
the
vicar
on
his
part
not
on
mine
ah
henry
knight
is
one
in
a
thousand
i
remember
his
speaking
to
me
on
this
very
subject
of
pronunciation
he
says
that
much
to
his
regret
he
sees
a
time
coming
when
every
man
will
pronounce
even
the
common
words
of
his
own
tongue
as
seems
right
in
his
own
ears
and
be
thought
none
the
worse
for
it
that
the
speaking
age
is
passing
away
to
make
room
for
the
writing
both
elfride
and
her
father
had
waited
attentively
to
hear
stephen
go
on
to
what
would
have
been
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
story
namely
what
circumstances
could
have
necessitated
such
an
unusual
method
of
education
but
no
further
explanation
was
volunteered
and
they
saw
by
the
young
man
s
manner
of
concentrating
himself
upon
the
that
he
was
anxious
to
drop
the
subject
the
game
proceeded
elfride
played
by
rote
stephen
by
thought
it
was
the
cruellest
thing
to
checkmate
him
after
so
much
labour
she
considered
what
was
she
dishonest
enough
to
do
in
her
compassion
to
let
him
checkmate
her
a
second
game
followed
and
being
herself
absolutely
indifferent
as
to
the
result
her
playing
was
above
the
average
among
women
and
she
knew
it
she
allowed
him
to
give
checkmate
again
a
final
game
in
which
she
adopted
the
muzio
gambit
as
her
opening
was
terminated
by
elfride
s
victory
at
the
twelfth
move
stephen
looked
up
suspiciously
his
heart
was
throbbing
even
more
excitedly
than
was
hers
which
itself
had
quickened
when
she
seriously
set
to
work
on
this
last
occasion
swancourt
had
left
the
room
you
have
been
trifling
with
me
till
now
he
exclaimed
his
face
flushing
you
did
not
play
your
best
in
the
first
two
games
elfride
s
guilt
showed
in
her
face
stephen
became
the
picture
of
vexation
and
sadness
which
relishable
for
a
moment
caused
her
the
next
instant
to
regret
the
mistake
she
had
made
mr
smith
forgive
me
she
said
sweetly
i
see
now
though
i
did
not
at
first
that
what
i
have
done
seems
like
contempt
for
your
skill
but
indeed
i
did
not
mean
it
in
that
sense
i
could
not
upon
my
conscience
win
a
victory
in
those
first
and
second
games
over
one
who
fought
at
such
a
disadvantage
and
so
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
murmured
bitterly
ah
you
are
cleverer
than
i
you
can
do
everything
i
can
do
nothing
o
miss
swancourt
he
burst
out
wildly
his
heart
swelling
in
his
throat
i
must
tell
you
how
i
love
you
all
these
months
of
my
absence
i
have
worshipped
he
leapt
from
his
seat
like
the
impulsive
lad
that
he
was
slid
round
to
her
side
and
almost
before
she
suspected
it
his
arm
was
round
her
waist
and
the
two
sets
of
curls
intermingled
so
entirely
new
was
love
to
elfride
that
she
trembled
as
much
from
the
novelty
of
the
emotion
as
from
the
emotion
itself
then
she
suddenly
withdrew
herself
and
stood
upright
vexed
that
she
had
submitted
unresistingly
even
to
his
momentary
pressure
she
resolved
to
consider
this
demonstration
as
premature
you
must
not
begin
such
things
as
those
she
said
with
coquettish
hauteur
of
a
very
transparent
nature
and
you
must
not
do
so
again
and
papa
is
let
me
kiss
you
only
a
little
one
he
said
with
his
usual
delicacy
and
without
reading
the
factitiousness
of
her
manner
no
not
only
on
your
cheek
forehead
certainly
you
care
for
somebody
else
then
ah
i
thought
so
i
am
sure
i
do
nor
for
me
either
how
can
i
tell
she
said
simply
the
simplicity
lying
merely
in
the
broad
outlines
of
her
manner
and
speech
there
were
the
semitone
of
voice
and
expression
of
eyes
which
tell
the
initiated
how
very
fragile
is
the
ice
of
reserve
at
these
times
footsteps
were
heard
swancourt
then
entered
the
room
and
their
private
colloquy
ended
the
day
after
this
partial
revelation
swancourt
proposed
a
drive
to
the
cliffs
beyond
targan
bay
a
distance
of
three
or
four
miles
half
an
hour
before
the
time
of
departure
a
crash
was
heard
in
the
back
yard
and
presently
worm
came
in
saying
partly
to
the
world
in
general
partly
to
himself
and
slightly
to
his
auditors
ay
ay
sure
that
frying
of
fish
will
be
the
end
of
william
worm
they
be
at
it
again
this
morning
same
as
ever
fizz
fizz
fizz
your
head
bad
again
worm
said
swancourt
what
was
that
noise
we
heard
in
the
yard
ay
sir
a
weak
wambling
man
am
i
and
the
frying
have
been
going
on
in
my
poor
head
all
through
the
long
night
and
this
morning
as
usual
and
i
was
so
dazed
wi
it
that
down
fell
a
piece
of
across
the
shaft
of
the
and
splintered
it
off
ay
says
i
i
feel
it
as
if
twas
my
own
shay
and
though
i
ve
done
it
and
parish
pay
is
my
lot
if
i
go
from
here
perhaps
i
am
as
independent
as
one
here
and
dear
me
the
shaft
of
the
carriage
broken
cried
elfride
she
was
disappointed
stephen
doubly
so
the
vicar
showed
more
warmth
of
temper
than
the
accident
seemed
to
demand
much
to
stephen
s
uneasiness
and
rather
to
his
surprise
he
had
not
supposed
so
much
latent
sternness
could
with
swancourt
s
frankness
and
you
shall
not
be
disappointed
said
the
vicar
at
length
it
is
almost
too
long
a
distance
for
you
to
walk
elfride
can
trot
down
on
her
pony
and
you
shall
have
my
old
nag
elfride
exclaimed
triumphantly
you
have
never
seen
me
on
horseback
oh
you
must
she
looked
at
stephen
and
read
his
thoughts
immediately
ah
you
don
t
ride
smith
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
don
fancy
a
man
not
able
to
ride
said
she
rather
pertly
the
vicar
came
to
his
rescue
that
s
common
enough
he
has
had
other
lessons
to
learn
now
i
recommend
this
plan
let
elfride
ride
on
horseback
and
you
smith
walk
beside
the
arrangement
was
welcomed
with
secret
delight
by
stephen
it
seemed
to
combine
in
itself
all
the
advantages
of
a
long
slow
ramble
with
elfride
without
the
contingent
possibility
of
the
enjoyment
being
spoilt
by
her
becoming
weary
the
pony
was
saddled
and
brought
round
now
smith
said
the
lady
imperatively
coming
downstairs
and
appearing
in
her
as
she
always
did
in
a
change
of
dress
like
a
new
edition
of
a
delightful
volume
you
have
a
task
to
perform
these
earrings
are
my
very
favourite
darling
ones
but
the
worst
of
it
is
that
they
have
such
short
hooks
that
they
are
liable
to
be
dropped
if
i
toss
my
head
about
much
and
when
i
am
riding
i
can
t
give
my
mind
to
them
it
would
be
doing
me
knight
service
if
you
keep
your
eyes
fixed
upon
them
and
remember
them
every
minute
of
the
day
and
tell
me
directly
i
drop
one
they
have
had
such
hairbreadth
escapes
haven
t
they
unity
she
continued
to
the
who
was
standing
at
the
door
yes
miss
that
they
have
said
unity
with
commiseration
once
twas
in
the
lane
that
i
found
one
of
them
pursued
elfride
reflectively
and
then
twas
by
the
gate
into
eighteen
acres
unity
chimed
in
and
then
twas
on
the
carpet
in
my
own
room
rejoined
elfride
merrily
and
then
twas
dangling
on
the
embroidery
of
your
petticoat
miss
and
then
twas
down
your
back
miss
wasn
t
it
and
oh
what
a
way
you
was
in
miss
wasn
t
you
my
until
you
found
it
stephen
took
elfride
s
slight
foot
upon
his
hand
one
two
three
and
up
she
said
unfortunately
not
so
he
staggered
and
lifted
and
the
horse
edged
round
and
elfride
was
ultimately
deposited
upon
the
ground
rather
more
forcibly
than
was
pleasant
smith
looked
all
contrition
never
mind
said
the
vicar
encouragingly
try
again
tis
a
little
accomplishment
that
requires
some
practice
although
it
looks
so
easy
stand
closer
to
the
horse
s
head
indeed
i
shan
t
let
him
try
again
said
she
with
a
microscopic
look
of
indignation
worm
come
here
and
help
me
to
worm
stepped
forward
and
she
was
in
the
saddle
in
a
trice
then
they
moved
on
going
for
some
distance
in
silence
the
hot
air
of
the
valley
being
occasionally
brushed
from
their
faces
by
a
cool
breeze
which
wound
its
way
along
ravines
leading
up
from
the
sea
i
suppose
said
stephen
that
a
man
who
can
neither
sit
in
a
saddle
himself
nor
help
another
person
into
one
seems
a
useless
incumbrance
but
miss
swancourt
i
ll
learn
to
do
it
all
for
your
sake
i
will
what
is
so
unusual
in
you
she
said
in
a
didactic
tone
justifiable
in
a
horsewoman
s
address
to
a
benighted
walker
is
that
your
knowledge
of
certain
things
should
be
combined
with
your
ignorance
of
certain
other
stephen
lifted
his
eyes
earnestly
to
hers
you
know
he
said
it
is
simply
because
there
are
so
many
other
things
to
be
learnt
in
this
wide
world
that
i
didn
t
trouble
about
that
particular
bit
of
knowledge
i
thought
it
would
be
useless
to
me
but
i
don
t
think
so
now
i
will
learn
riding
and
all
connected
with
it
because
then
you
would
like
me
better
do
you
like
me
much
less
for
this
she
looked
sideways
at
him
with
critical
meditation
tenderly
rendered
do
i
seem
like
la
belle
dame
sans
merci
she
began
suddenly
without
replying
to
his
question
fancy
yourself
saying
smith
i
sat
her
on
my
pacing
steed
and
nothing
else
saw
all
day
long
for
sidelong
would
she
bend
and
sing
a
fairy
s
song
she
found
me
roots
of
relish
sweet
and
honey
wild
and
manna
dew
and
that
s
all
she
no
no
said
the
young
man
stilly
and
with
a
rising
colour
and
sure
in
language
strange
she
said
i
love
thee
not
at
all
she
rejoined
quickly
see
how
i
can
gallop
now
pansy
off
and
elfride
started
and
stephen
beheld
her
light
figure
contracting
to
the
dimensions
of
a
bird
as
she
sank
into
the
distance
her
hair
flowing
he
walked
on
in
the
same
direction
and
for
a
considerable
time
could
see
no
signs
of
her
returning
dull
as
a
flower
without
the
sun
he
sat
down
upon
a
stone
and
not
for
fifteen
minutes
was
any
sound
of
horse
or
rider
to
be
heard
then
elfride
and
pansy
appeared
on
the
hill
in
a
round
trot
such
a
delightful
scamper
as
we
have
had
she
said
her
face
flushed
and
her
eyes
sparkling
she
turned
the
horse
s
head
stephen
arose
and
they
went
on
again
well
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
smith
after
my
long
absence
do
you
remember
a
question
you
could
not
exactly
answer
last
night
whether
i
was
more
to
you
than
anybody
else
said
he
i
can
not
exactly
answer
now
why
can
t
you
because
i
don
t
know
if
i
am
more
to
you
than
any
one
yes
indeed
you
are
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
intensest
appreciation
at
the
same
time
gliding
round
and
looking
into
her
face
eyes
in
eyes
he
murmured
playfully
and
she
blushingly
obeyed
looking
back
into
his
and
why
not
lips
on
lips
continued
stephen
daringly
no
certainly
not
anybody
might
look
and
it
would
be
the
death
of
me
you
may
kiss
my
hand
if
you
he
expressed
by
a
look
that
to
kiss
a
hand
through
a
glove
and
that
a
was
not
a
great
treat
under
the
circumstances
there
then
i
ll
take
my
glove
off
isn
t
it
a
pretty
white
hand
ah
you
don
t
want
to
kiss
it
and
you
shall
not
now
if
i
do
not
may
i
never
kiss
again
you
severe
elfride
you
know
i
think
more
of
you
than
i
can
tell
that
you
are
my
queen
i
would
die
for
you
elfride
a
rapid
red
again
filled
her
cheeks
and
she
looked
at
him
meditatively
what
a
proud
moment
it
was
for
elfride
then
she
was
ruling
a
heart
with
absolute
despotism
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
stephen
stealthily
pounced
upon
her
hand
no
i
won
t
i
won
t
she
said
intractably
and
you
shouldn
t
take
me
by
there
ensued
a
mild
form
of
tussle
for
absolute
possession
of
the
hand
in
which
the
boisterousness
of
boy
and
girl
was
far
more
prominent
than
the
dignity
of
man
and
woman
then
pansy
became
restless
elfride
recovered
her
position
and
remembered
herself
you
make
me
behave
in
not
a
nice
way
at
all
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
neither
of
pleasure
nor
anger
but
partaking
of
both
i
ought
not
to
have
allowed
such
a
romp
we
are
too
old
now
for
that
sort
of
i
hope
you
don
t
think
me
too
too
much
of
a
sort
of
man
said
he
in
a
penitent
tone
conscious
that
he
too
had
lost
a
little
dignity
by
the
proceeding
you
are
too
familiar
and
i
can
t
have
it
considering
the
shortness
of
the
time
we
have
known
each
other
smith
you
take
too
much
upon
you
you
think
i
am
a
country
girl
and
it
doesn
t
matter
how
you
behave
to
me
i
assure
you
miss
swancourt
that
i
had
no
idea
of
freak
in
my
mind
i
wanted
to
imprint
a
sweet
serious
kiss
upon
your
hand
and
that
s
now
that
s
creeping
round
again
and
you
mustn
t
look
into
my
eyes
so
she
said
shaking
her
head
at
him
and
trotting
on
a
few
paces
in
advance
thus
she
led
the
way
out
of
the
lane
and
across
some
fields
in
the
direction
of
the
cliffs
at
the
boundary
of
the
fields
nearest
the
sea
she
expressed
a
wish
to
dismount
the
horse
was
tied
to
a
post
and
they
both
followed
an
irregular
path
which
ultimately
terminated
upon
a
flat
ledge
passing
round
the
face
of
the
huge
rock
at
a
height
about
midway
between
the
sea
and
the
topmost
verge
there
far
beneath
and
before
them
lay
the
everlasting
stretch
of
ocean
there
upon
detached
rocks
were
the
white
screaming
gulls
seeming
ever
intending
to
settle
and
yet
always
passing
on
right
and
left
ranked
the
toothed
and
zigzag
line
of
heights
forming
the
series
which
culminated
in
the
one
beneath
their
feet
behind
the
youth
and
maiden
was
a
tempting
alcove
and
seat
formed
naturally
in
the
beetling
mass
and
wide
enough
to
admit
two
or
three
persons
elfride
sat
down
and
stephen
sat
beside
her
i
am
afraid
it
is
hardly
proper
of
us
to
be
here
either
she
said
half
inquiringly
we
have
not
known
each
other
long
enough
for
this
kind
of
thing
have
we
oh
yes
he
replied
judicially
quite
long
how
do
you
know
it
is
not
length
of
time
but
the
manner
in
which
our
minutes
beat
that
makes
enough
or
not
enough
in
our
yes
i
see
that
but
i
wish
papa
suspected
or
knew
what
a
very
new
thing
i
am
doing
he
does
not
think
of
it
at
darling
elfie
i
wish
we
could
be
married
it
is
wrong
for
me
to
say
it
i
know
it
is
before
you
know
more
but
i
wish
we
might
be
all
the
same
do
you
love
me
deeply
deeply
no
she
said
in
a
fluster
at
this
denial
stephen
turned
his
face
away
decisively
and
preserved
an
ominous
silence
the
only
objects
of
interest
on
earth
for
him
being
apparently
the
three
or
circling
in
the
air
afar
off
i
didn
t
mean
to
stop
you
quite
she
faltered
with
some
alarm
and
seeing
that
he
still
remained
silent
she
added
more
anxiously
if
you
say
that
again
perhaps
i
will
not
be
quite
quite
so
obstinate
if
if
you
don
t
like
me
to
oh
my
elfride
he
exclaimed
and
kissed
her
it
was
elfride
s
first
kiss
and
so
awkward
and
unused
was
she
full
of
striving
no
relenting
there
was
none
of
those
apparent
struggles
to
get
out
of
the
trap
which
only
results
in
getting
further
in
no
final
attitude
of
receptivity
no
easy
close
of
shoulder
to
shoulder
hand
upon
hand
face
upon
face
and
in
spite
of
coyness
the
lips
in
the
right
place
at
the
supreme
moment
that
graceful
though
apparently
accidental
falling
into
position
which
many
have
noticed
as
precipitating
the
end
and
making
sweethearts
the
sweeter
was
not
here
why
because
experience
was
absent
a
woman
must
have
had
many
kisses
before
she
kisses
well
in
fact
the
art
of
tendering
the
lips
for
these
amatory
salutes
follows
the
principles
laid
down
in
treatises
on
legerdemain
for
performing
the
trick
called
forcing
a
card
the
card
is
to
be
shifted
nimbly
withdrawn
edged
under
and
withal
not
to
be
offered
till
the
moment
the
unsuspecting
person
s
hand
reaches
the
pack
this
forcing
to
be
done
so
modestly
and
yet
so
coaxingly
that
the
person
trifled
with
imagines
he
is
really
choosing
what
is
in
fact
thrust
into
his
hand
well
there
were
no
such
facilities
now
and
stephen
was
conscious
of
it
first
with
a
momentary
regret
that
his
kiss
should
be
spoilt
by
her
confused
receipt
of
it
and
then
with
the
pleasant
perception
that
her
awkwardness
was
her
charm
and
you
do
care
for
me
and
love
me
said
he
very
much
and
i
mustn
t
ask
you
if
you
ll
wait
for
me
and
be
my
wife
some
day
why
not
she
said
naively
there
is
a
reason
why
my
not
any
one
that
i
know
suppose
there
is
something
connected
with
me
which
makes
it
almost
impossible
for
you
to
agree
to
be
my
wife
or
for
your
father
to
countenance
such
an
idea
nothing
shall
make
me
cease
to
love
you
no
blemish
can
be
found
upon
your
personal
nature
that
is
pure
and
generous
i
know
and
having
that
how
can
i
be
cold
to
you
and
shall
nothing
else
affect
us
shall
nothing
beyond
my
nature
be
a
part
of
my
quality
in
your
eyes
elfie
nothing
whatever
she
said
with
a
breath
of
relief
is
that
all
some
outside
circumstance
what
do
i
care
you
can
hardly
judge
dear
till
you
know
what
has
to
be
judged
for
that
we
will
stop
till
we
get
home
i
believe
in
you
but
i
can
not
feel
love
is
new
and
fresh
to
us
as
the
dew
and
we
are
together
as
the
lover
s
world
goes
this
is
a
great
deal
stephen
i
fancy
i
see
the
difference
between
me
and
you
between
men
and
women
generally
perhaps
i
am
content
to
build
happiness
on
any
accidental
basis
that
may
lie
near
at
hand
you
are
for
making
a
world
to
suit
your
elfride
you
sometimes
say
things
which
make
you
seem
suddenly
to
become
five
years
older
than
you
are
or
than
i
am
and
that
remark
is
one
i
couldn
t
think
so
old
as
that
try
how
i
might
no
lover
has
ever
kissed
you
before
i
knew
that
you
were
so
unused
you
ride
well
but
you
don
t
kiss
nicely
at
all
and
i
was
told
once
by
my
friend
knight
that
that
is
an
excellent
fault
in
now
come
i
must
mount
again
or
we
shall
not
be
home
by
and
they
returned
to
where
pansy
stood
tethered
instead
of
entrusting
my
weight
to
a
young
man
s
unstable
palm
she
continued
gaily
i
prefer
a
surer
as
the
villagers
call
it
in
the
form
of
a
gate
there
now
i
am
myself
they
proceeded
homeward
at
the
same
walking
pace
her
blitheness
won
stephen
out
of
his
thoughtfulness
and
each
forgot
everything
but
the
tone
of
the
moment
what
did
you
love
me
for
she
said
after
a
long
musing
look
at
a
flying
bird
i
don
t
know
he
replied
idly
oh
yes
you
do
insisted
elfride
perhaps
for
your
what
of
them
now
don
t
vex
me
by
a
light
answer
what
of
my
eyes
oh
nothing
to
be
mentioned
they
are
indifferently
come
stephen
i
won
t
have
that
what
did
you
love
me
for
it
might
have
been
for
your
mouth
well
what
about
my
mouth
i
thought
it
was
a
passable
mouth
enough
that
s
not
very
with
a
pretty
pout
and
sweet
lips
but
actually
nothing
more
than
what
everybody
don
t
make
up
things
out
of
your
head
as
you
go
on
there
s
a
dear
stephen
now
what
did
you
love
me
for
perhaps
twas
for
your
neck
and
hair
though
i
am
not
sure
or
for
your
idle
blood
that
did
nothing
but
wander
away
from
your
cheeks
and
back
again
but
i
am
not
sure
or
your
hands
and
arms
that
they
eclipsed
all
other
hands
and
arms
or
your
feet
that
they
played
about
under
your
dress
like
little
mice
or
your
tongue
that
it
was
of
a
dear
delicate
tone
but
i
am
not
altogether
ah
that
s
pretty
to
say
but
i
don
t
care
for
your
love
if
it
made
a
mere
flat
picture
of
me
in
that
way
and
not
being
sure
and
such
cold
reasoning
but
what
you
felt
i
was
you
know
stephen
at
this
a
stealthy
laugh
and
frisky
look
into
his
face
when
you
said
to
yourself
i
ll
certainly
love
that
young
i
never
said
when
you
said
to
yourself
then
i
never
will
love
that
young
i
didn
t
say
that
then
was
it
i
suppose
i
must
love
that
young
lady
what
then
twas
much
more
fluctuating
not
so
tell
me
do
it
was
that
i
ought
not
to
think
about
you
if
i
loved
you
ah
that
i
don
t
understand
there
s
no
getting
it
out
of
you
and
i
ll
not
ask
you
ever
any
more
never
more
to
say
out
of
the
deep
reality
of
your
heart
what
you
loved
me
sweet
tantalizer
what
s
the
use
it
comes
to
this
sole
simple
thing
that
at
one
time
i
had
never
seen
you
and
i
didn
t
love
you
that
then
i
saw
you
and
i
did
love
you
is
that
enough
yes
i
will
make
it
do
know
i
think
what
i
love
you
for
you
are
of
course
but
i
didn
t
mean
for
that
it
is
because
you
are
so
docile
and
those
are
not
quite
the
correct
qualities
for
a
man
to
be
loved
for
said
stephen
in
rather
a
dissatisfied
tone
of
well
never
mind
i
must
ask
your
father
to
allow
us
to
be
engaged
directly
we
get
indoors
it
will
be
for
a
long
i
like
it
the
better
don
t
mention
it
till
why
because
if
he
should
object
i
don
t
think
he
will
but
if
he
should
we
shall
have
a
day
longer
of
happiness
from
our
ignorance
what
are
you
thinking
of
so
deeply
i
was
thinking
how
my
dear
friend
knight
would
enjoy
this
scene
i
wish
he
could
come
you
seem
very
much
engrossed
with
him
she
answered
with
a
jealous
little
toss
he
must
be
an
interesting
man
to
take
up
so
much
of
your
interesting
said
stephen
his
face
glowing
with
his
fervour
noble
you
ought
to
oh
yes
yes
i
forgot
she
said
half
satirically
the
noblest
man
in
england
as
you
told
us
last
he
is
a
fine
fellow
laugh
as
you
will
miss
i
know
he
is
your
hero
but
what
does
he
do
anything
he
what
does
he
write
i
have
never
heard
of
his
because
his
personality
and
that
of
several
others
like
him
is
absorbed
into
a
huge
we
namely
the
impalpable
entity
called
the
present
a
social
and
literary
is
he
only
a
reviewer
only
elfie
why
i
can
tell
you
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
on
the
staff
of
the
present
finer
than
being
a
novelist
that
s
a
hit
at
me
and
my
poor
court
of
kellyon
no
elfride
he
whispered
i
didn
t
mean
that
i
mean
that
he
is
really
a
literary
man
of
some
eminence
and
not
altogether
a
reviewer
he
writes
things
of
a
higher
class
than
reviews
though
he
reviews
a
book
occasionally
his
ordinary
productions
are
social
and
ethical
essays
all
that
the
present
contains
which
is
not
literary
i
admit
he
must
be
talented
if
he
writes
for
the
present
we
have
it
sent
to
us
irregularly
i
want
papa
to
be
a
subscriber
but
he
s
so
conservative
now
the
next
point
in
this
knight
i
suppose
he
is
a
very
good
an
excellent
man
i
shall
try
to
be
his
intimate
friend
some
but
aren
t
you
now
no
not
so
much
as
that
replied
stephen
as
if
such
a
supposition
were
extravagant
you
see
it
was
in
this
way
he
came
originally
from
the
same
place
as
i
and
taught
me
things
but
i
am
not
intimate
with
him
shan
t
i
be
glad
when
i
get
richer
and
better
known
and
hob
and
nob
with
him
stephen
s
eyes
sparkled
a
pout
began
to
shape
itself
upon
elfride
s
soft
lips
you
think
always
of
him
and
like
him
better
than
you
do
me
no
indeed
elfride
the
feeling
is
different
quite
but
i
do
like
him
and
he
deserves
even
more
affection
from
me
than
i
you
are
not
nice
now
and
you
make
me
as
jealous
as
possible
she
exclaimed
perversely
i
know
you
will
never
speak
to
any
third
person
of
me
so
warmly
as
you
do
to
me
of
but
you
don
t
understand
elfride
he
said
with
an
anxious
movement
you
shall
know
him
some
day
he
is
so
brilliant
no
it
isn
t
exactly
brilliant
so
thoughtful
nor
does
thoughtful
express
him
that
it
would
charm
you
to
talk
to
him
he
s
a
most
desirable
friend
and
that
isn
t
half
i
could
i
don
t
care
how
good
he
is
i
don
t
want
to
know
him
because
he
comes
between
me
and
you
you
think
of
him
night
and
day
ever
so
much
more
than
of
anybody
else
and
when
you
are
thinking
of
him
i
am
shut
out
of
your
no
dear
elfride
i
love
you
and
i
don
t
like
you
to
tell
me
so
warmly
about
him
when
you
are
in
the
middle
of
loving
me
stephen
suppose
that
i
and
this
man
knight
of
yours
were
both
drowning
and
you
could
only
save
one
of
us
yes
the
stupid
old
proposition
which
would
i
save
well
which
not
both
of
you
he
said
pressing
her
pendent
hand
no
that
won
t
do
only
one
of
i
can
not
say
i
don
t
know
it
is
disagreeable
quite
a
horrid
idea
to
have
to
i
know
you
would
save
him
and
let
me
drown
drown
drown
and
i
don
t
care
about
your
love
she
had
endeavoured
to
give
a
playful
tone
to
her
words
but
the
latter
speech
was
rather
forced
in
its
gaiety
at
this
point
in
the
discussion
she
trotted
off
to
turn
a
corner
which
was
avoided
by
the
footpath
the
road
and
the
path
reuniting
at
a
point
a
little
further
on
on
again
making
her
appearance
she
continually
managed
to
look
in
a
direction
away
from
him
and
left
him
in
the
cool
shade
of
her
displeasure
stephen
was
soon
beaten
at
this
game
of
indifference
he
went
round
and
entered
the
range
of
her
vision
are
you
offended
elfie
why
don
t
you
talk
save
me
then
and
let
that
mr
clever
of
yours
drown
i
hate
him
now
which
would
you
really
elfride
you
should
not
press
such
a
hard
question
it
is
then
i
won
t
be
alone
with
you
any
more
unkind
to
wound
me
so
she
laughed
at
her
own
absurdity
but
persisted
come
elfie
let
s
make
it
up
and
be
say
you
would
save
me
then
and
let
him
i
would
save
you
and
him
and
let
him
drown
come
or
you
don
t
love
me
she
teasingly
went
on
and
let
him
drown
he
ejaculated
despairingly
there
now
i
am
yours
she
said
and
a
woman
s
flush
of
triumph
lit
her
eyes
only
one
earring
miss
as
i
m
alive
said
unity
on
their
entering
the
hall
with
a
face
expressive
of
wretched
misgiving
elfride
s
hand
flew
like
an
arrow
to
her
ear
there
she
exclaimed
to
stephen
looking
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
reproach
i
quite
forgot
indeed
if
i
had
only
remembered
he
answered
with
a
face
she
wheeled
herself
round
and
turned
into
the
shrubbery
stephen
followed
if
you
had
told
me
to
watch
anything
stephen
i
should
have
religiously
done
it
she
capriciously
went
on
as
soon
as
she
heard
him
behind
her
forgetting
is
well
you
will
find
it
if
you
want
me
to
respect
you
and
be
engaged
to
you
when
we
have
asked
she
considered
a
moment
and
added
more
seriously
i
know
now
where
i
dropped
it
stephen
it
was
on
the
cliff
i
remember
a
faint
sensation
of
some
change
about
me
but
i
was
too
absent
to
think
of
it
then
and
that
s
where
it
is
now
and
you
must
go
and
look
i
ll
go
at
and
he
strode
away
up
the
valley
under
a
broiling
sun
and
amid
the
deathlike
silence
of
early
afternoon
he
ascended
with
haste
the
windy
range
of
rocks
to
where
they
had
sat
felt
and
peered
about
the
stones
and
crannies
but
elfride
s
stray
jewel
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
next
stephen
slowly
retraced
his
steps
and
pausing
at
a
to
reflect
a
while
he
left
the
plateau
and
struck
downwards
across
some
fields
in
the
direction
of
endelstow
house
he
walked
along
the
path
by
the
river
without
the
slightest
hesitation
as
to
its
bearing
apparently
quite
familiar
with
every
inch
of
the
ground
as
the
shadows
began
to
lengthen
and
the
sunlight
to
mellow
he
passed
through
two
and
drew
near
the
outskirts
of
endelstow
park
the
river
now
ran
along
under
the
park
fence
previous
to
entering
the
grove
itself
a
little
further
on
here
stood
a
cottage
between
the
fence
and
the
stream
on
a
slightly
elevated
spot
of
ground
round
which
the
river
took
a
turn
the
characteristic
feature
of
this
snug
habitation
was
its
one
chimney
in
the
gable
end
its
squareness
of
form
disguised
by
a
huge
cloak
of
ivy
which
had
grown
so
luxuriantly
and
extended
so
far
from
its
base
as
to
increase
the
apparent
bulk
of
the
chimney
to
the
dimensions
of
a
tower
some
little
distance
from
the
back
of
the
house
rose
the
park
boundary
and
over
this
were
to
be
seen
the
sycamores
of
the
grove
making
slow
inclinations
to
the
air
stephen
crossed
the
little
wood
bridge
in
front
went
up
to
the
cottage
door
and
opened
it
without
knock
or
signal
of
any
kind
exclamations
of
welcome
burst
from
some
person
or
persons
when
the
door
was
thrust
ajar
followed
by
the
scrape
of
chairs
on
a
stone
floor
as
if
pushed
back
by
their
occupiers
in
rising
from
a
table
the
door
was
closed
again
and
nothing
could
now
be
heard
from
within
save
a
lively
chatter
and
the
rattle
of
plates
chapter
viii
is
no
baron
or
the
mists
were
creeping
out
of
pools
and
swamps
for
their
pilgrimages
of
the
night
when
stephen
came
up
to
the
front
door
of
the
vicarage
elfride
was
standing
on
the
step
illuminated
by
a
expanse
of
western
sky
you
never
have
been
all
this
time
looking
for
that
earring
she
said
anxiously
oh
no
and
i
have
not
found
never
mind
though
i
am
much
vexed
they
are
my
prettiest
but
stephen
what
ever
have
you
been
doing
where
have
you
been
i
have
been
so
uneasy
i
feared
for
you
knowing
not
an
inch
of
the
country
i
thought
suppose
he
has
fallen
over
the
cliff
but
now
i
am
inclined
to
scold
you
for
frightening
me
i
must
speak
to
your
father
now
he
said
rather
abruptly
i
have
so
much
to
say
to
him
and
to
you
will
what
you
have
to
say
endanger
this
nice
time
of
ours
and
is
it
that
same
shadowy
secret
you
allude
to
so
frequently
and
will
it
make
me
unhappy
she
breathed
heavily
and
looked
around
as
if
for
a
prompter
put
it
off
till
she
said
he
involuntarily
sighed
too
no
it
must
come
where
is
your
father
elfride
somewhere
in
the
kitchen
garden
i
think
she
replied
that
is
his
favourite
evening
retreat
i
will
leave
you
now
say
all
that
s
to
be
said
do
all
there
is
to
be
done
think
of
me
waiting
anxiously
for
the
and
she
the
house
she
waited
in
the
watching
the
lights
sink
to
shadows
the
shadows
sink
to
darkness
until
her
impatience
to
know
what
had
occurred
in
the
garden
could
no
longer
be
controlled
she
passed
round
the
shrubbery
unlatched
the
garden
door
and
skimmed
with
her
keen
eyes
the
whole
twilighted
space
that
the
four
walls
enclosed
and
sheltered
they
were
not
there
she
mounted
a
little
ladder
which
had
been
used
for
gathering
fruit
and
looked
over
the
wall
into
the
field
this
field
extended
to
the
limits
of
the
glebe
which
was
enclosed
on
that
side
by
a
under
the
hedge
was
swancourt
walking
up
and
down
and
talking
aloud
to
himself
as
it
sounded
at
first
no
another
voice
shouted
occasional
replies
and
this
interlocutor
seemed
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
the
voice
though
soft
in
quality
was
not
stephen
s
the
second
speaker
must
have
been
in
the
garden
of
an
old
hard
by
which
together
with
a
small
estate
attached
had
lately
been
purchased
by
a
person
named
troyton
whom
elfride
had
never
seen
her
father
might
have
struck
up
an
acquaintanceship
with
some
member
of
that
family
through
the
or
a
stranger
to
the
neighbourhood
might
have
wandered
thither
well
there
was
no
necessity
for
disturbing
him
and
it
seemed
that
after
all
stephen
had
not
yet
made
his
desired
communication
to
her
father
again
she
went
indoors
wondering
where
stephen
could
be
for
want
of
something
better
to
do
she
went
upstairs
to
her
own
little
room
here
she
sat
down
at
the
open
window
and
leaning
with
her
elbow
on
the
table
and
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
she
fell
into
meditation
it
was
a
hot
and
still
august
night
every
disturbance
of
the
silence
which
rose
to
the
dignity
of
a
noise
could
be
heard
for
miles
and
the
merest
sound
for
a
long
distance
so
she
remained
thinking
of
stephen
and
wishing
he
had
not
deprived
her
of
his
company
to
no
purpose
as
it
appeared
how
delicate
and
sensitive
he
was
she
reflected
and
yet
he
was
man
enough
to
have
a
private
mystery
which
considerably
elevated
him
in
her
eyes
thus
looking
at
things
with
an
inward
vision
she
lost
consciousness
of
the
flight
of
time
strange
conjunctions
of
circumstances
particularly
those
of
a
trivial
everyday
kind
are
so
frequent
in
an
ordinary
life
that
we
grow
used
to
their
unaccountableness
and
forget
the
question
whether
the
very
long
odds
against
such
juxtaposition
is
not
almost
a
disproof
of
it
being
a
matter
of
chance
at
all
what
occurred
to
elfride
at
this
moment
was
a
case
in
point
she
was
vividly
imagining
for
the
twentieth
time
the
kiss
of
the
morning
and
putting
her
lips
together
in
the
position
another
such
a
one
would
demand
when
she
heard
the
identical
operation
performed
on
the
lawn
immediately
beneath
her
window
a
kiss
not
of
the
quiet
and
stealthy
kind
but
decisive
loud
and
smart
her
face
flushed
and
she
looked
out
but
to
no
purpose
the
dark
rim
of
the
upland
drew
a
keen
sad
line
against
the
pale
glow
of
the
sky
unbroken
except
where
a
young
cedar
on
the
lawn
that
had
outgrown
its
fellow
trees
shot
its
pointed
head
across
the
horizon
piercing
the
firmamental
lustre
like
a
sting
it
was
just
possible
that
had
any
persons
been
standing
on
the
grassy
portions
of
the
lawn
elfride
might
have
seen
their
dusky
forms
but
the
shrubs
which
once
had
merely
dotted
the
glade
had
now
grown
bushy
and
large
till
they
hid
at
least
half
the
enclosure
containing
them
the
kissing
pair
might
have
been
behind
some
of
these
at
any
rate
nobody
was
in
sight
had
no
enigma
ever
been
connected
with
her
lover
by
his
hints
and
absences
elfride
would
never
have
thought
of
admitting
into
her
mind
a
suspicion
that
he
might
be
concerned
in
the
foregoing
enactment
but
the
reservations
he
at
present
insisted
on
while
they
added
to
the
mystery
without
which
perhaps
she
would
never
have
seriously
loved
him
at
all
were
calculated
to
nourish
doubts
of
all
kinds
and
with
a
slow
flush
of
jealousy
she
asked
herself
might
he
not
be
the
culprit
elfride
glided
downstairs
on
tiptoe
and
out
to
the
precise
spot
on
which
she
had
parted
from
stephen
to
enable
him
to
speak
privately
to
her
father
thence
she
wandered
into
all
the
nooks
around
the
place
from
which
the
sound
seemed
to
proceed
among
the
huge
laurestines
about
the
tufts
of
pampas
grasses
amid
the
variegated
hollies
under
the
weeping
nobody
was
there
returning
indoors
she
called
unity
she
is
gone
to
her
aunt
s
to
spend
the
evening
said
swancourt
thrusting
his
head
out
of
his
study
door
and
letting
the
light
of
his
candles
stream
upon
elfride
s
face
less
revealing
than
as
it
seemed
to
herself
creating
the
blush
of
uneasy
perplexity
that
was
burning
upon
her
cheek
i
didn
t
know
you
were
indoors
papa
she
said
with
surprise
surely
no
light
was
shining
from
the
window
when
i
was
on
the
lawn
and
she
looked
and
saw
that
the
shutters
were
still
open
oh
yes
i
am
in
he
said
indifferently
what
did
you
want
unity
for
i
think
she
laid
supper
before
she
went
did
she
i
have
not
been
to
see
i
didn
t
want
her
for
elfride
scarcely
knew
now
that
a
definite
reason
was
required
what
that
reason
was
her
mind
for
a
moment
strayed
to
another
subject
unimportant
as
it
seemed
the
red
ember
of
a
match
was
lying
inside
the
fender
which
explained
that
why
she
had
seen
no
rays
from
the
window
was
because
the
candles
had
only
just
been
lighted
i
ll
come
directly
said
the
vicar
i
thought
you
were
out
somewhere
with
even
the
inexperienced
elfride
could
not
help
thinking
that
her
father
must
be
wonderfully
blind
if
he
failed
to
perceive
what
was
the
nascent
consequence
of
herself
and
stephen
being
so
unceremoniously
left
together
wonderfully
careless
if
he
saw
it
and
did
not
think
about
it
wonderfully
good
if
as
seemed
to
her
by
far
the
most
probable
supposition
he
saw
it
and
thought
about
it
and
approved
of
it
these
reflections
were
cut
short
by
the
appearance
of
stephen
just
outside
the
porch
silvered
about
the
head
and
shoulders
with
touches
of
moonlight
that
had
begun
to
creep
through
the
trees
has
your
trouble
anything
to
do
with
a
kiss
on
the
lawn
she
asked
abruptly
almost
passionately
kiss
on
the
lawn
yes
she
said
imperiously
now
i
didn
t
comprehend
your
meaning
nor
do
i
now
exactly
i
certainly
have
kissed
nobody
on
the
lawn
if
that
is
really
what
you
want
to
know
you
know
nothing
about
such
a
performance
nothing
whatever
what
makes
you
ask
don
t
press
me
to
tell
it
is
nothing
of
importance
and
stephen
you
have
not
yet
spoken
to
papa
about
our
engagement
no
he
said
regretfully
i
could
not
find
him
directly
and
then
i
went
on
thinking
so
much
of
what
you
said
about
objections
refusals
bitter
words
possibly
ending
our
happiness
that
i
resolved
to
put
it
off
till
that
gives
us
one
more
day
of
delight
delight
of
a
tremulous
yes
but
it
would
be
improper
to
be
silent
too
long
i
think
she
said
in
a
delicate
voice
which
implied
that
her
face
had
grown
warm
i
want
him
to
know
we
love
stephen
why
did
you
adopt
as
your
own
my
thought
of
delay
i
will
explain
but
i
want
to
tell
you
of
my
secret
first
to
tell
you
now
it
is
two
or
three
hours
yet
to
bedtime
let
us
walk
up
the
hill
to
the
elfride
passively
assented
and
they
went
from
the
lawn
by
a
side
wicket
and
ascended
into
the
open
expanse
of
moonlight
which
streamed
around
the
lonely
edifice
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
the
door
was
locked
they
turned
from
the
porch
and
walked
hand
in
hand
to
find
a
in
the
churchyard
stephen
chose
a
flat
tomb
showing
itself
to
be
newer
and
whiter
than
those
around
it
and
sitting
down
himself
gently
drew
her
hand
towards
him
no
not
there
she
said
why
not
here
a
mere
fancy
but
never
and
she
sat
down
elfie
will
you
love
me
in
spite
of
everything
that
may
be
said
against
me
o
stephen
what
makes
you
repeat
that
so
continually
and
so
sadly
you
know
i
will
yes
indeed
she
said
drawing
closer
whatever
may
be
said
of
you
and
nothing
bad
can
be
i
will
cling
to
you
just
the
same
your
ways
shall
be
my
ways
until
i
did
you
ever
think
what
my
parents
might
be
or
what
society
i
originally
moved
in
no
not
particularly
i
have
observed
one
or
two
little
points
in
your
manners
which
are
rather
quaint
no
more
i
suppose
you
have
moved
in
the
ordinary
society
of
professional
supposing
i
have
not
that
none
of
my
family
have
a
profession
except
me
i
don
t
mind
what
you
are
only
concerns
where
do
you
think
i
went
to
school
i
mean
to
what
kind
of
school
dr
somebody
s
academy
she
said
simply
no
to
a
dame
school
originally
then
to
a
national
only
to
those
well
i
love
you
just
as
much
stephen
dear
stephen
she
murmured
tenderly
i
do
indeed
and
why
should
you
tell
me
these
things
so
impressively
what
do
they
matter
to
me
he
held
her
closer
and
proceeded
what
do
you
think
my
father
is
does
for
his
living
that
is
to
say
he
practises
some
profession
or
calling
i
no
he
is
a
a
freemason
no
a
cottager
and
journeyman
elfride
said
nothing
at
first
after
a
while
she
whispered
that
is
a
strange
idea
to
me
but
never
mind
what
does
it
matter
but
aren
t
you
angry
with
me
for
not
telling
you
before
no
not
at
all
is
your
mother
alive
is
she
a
nice
lady
very
the
best
mother
in
the
world
her
people
had
been
yeomen
for
centuries
but
she
was
only
a
o
stephen
came
from
her
in
whispered
exclamation
she
continued
to
attend
to
a
dairy
long
after
my
father
married
her
pursued
stephen
without
further
hesitation
and
i
remember
very
well
how
when
i
was
very
young
i
used
to
go
to
the
milking
look
on
at
the
skimming
sleep
through
the
churning
and
make
believe
i
helped
her
ah
that
was
a
happy
time
enough
no
never
not
yes
it
i
don
t
see
how
happiness
could
be
where
the
drudgery
of
had
to
be
done
for
a
living
the
hands
red
and
chapped
and
the
shoes
clogged
i
do
own
that
it
seems
odd
to
regard
you
in
the
light
of
of
having
been
so
rough
in
your
youth
and
done
menial
things
of
that
stephen
withdrew
an
inch
or
two
from
her
side
but
i
do
love
you
just
the
same
she
continued
getting
closer
under
his
shoulder
again
and
i
don
t
care
anything
about
the
past
and
i
see
that
you
are
all
the
worthier
for
having
pushed
on
in
the
world
in
such
a
it
is
not
my
worthiness
it
is
knight
s
who
pushed
ah
always
he
always
he
yes
and
properly
so
now
elfride
you
see
the
reason
of
his
teaching
me
by
letter
i
knew
him
years
before
he
went
to
oxford
but
i
had
not
got
far
enough
in
my
reading
for
him
to
entertain
the
idea
of
helping
me
in
classics
till
he
left
home
then
i
was
sent
away
from
the
village
and
we
very
seldom
met
but
he
kept
up
this
system
of
tuition
by
correspondence
with
the
greatest
regularity
i
will
tell
you
all
the
story
but
not
now
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
now
beyond
giving
places
persons
and
his
voice
became
timidly
slow
at
this
point
no
don
t
take
trouble
to
say
more
you
are
a
dear
honest
fellow
to
say
so
much
as
you
have
and
it
is
not
so
dreadful
either
it
has
become
a
normal
thing
that
millionaires
commence
by
going
up
to
london
with
their
tools
at
their
back
and
in
their
pockets
that
sort
of
origin
is
getting
so
respected
she
continued
cheerfully
that
it
is
acquiring
some
of
the
odour
of
norman
ah
if
i
had
made
my
fortune
i
shouldn
t
mind
but
i
am
only
a
possible
maker
of
it
as
it
is
quite
enough
and
so
this
is
what
your
trouble
was
i
thought
i
was
doing
wrong
in
letting
you
love
me
without
telling
you
my
story
and
yet
i
feared
to
do
so
elfie
i
dreaded
to
lose
you
and
i
was
cowardly
on
that
how
plain
everything
about
you
seems
after
this
explanation
your
peculiarities
in
the
pronunciation
papa
noticed
in
your
latin
your
odd
mixture
of
with
ignorance
of
ordinary
social
accomplishments
are
accounted
for
in
a
moment
and
has
this
anything
to
do
with
what
i
saw
at
lord
luxellian
s
what
did
you
see
i
saw
the
shadow
of
yourself
putting
a
cloak
round
a
lady
i
was
at
the
side
door
you
two
were
in
a
room
with
the
window
towards
me
you
came
to
me
a
moment
she
was
my
your
mother
there
she
withdrew
herself
to
look
at
him
silently
in
her
interest
elfride
said
stephen
i
was
going
to
tell
you
the
remainder
i
have
been
keeping
it
back
i
must
tell
it
now
after
all
the
remainder
of
my
revelation
refers
to
where
my
parents
are
where
do
you
think
they
live
you
know
them
by
sight
at
any
i
know
them
she
said
in
suspended
amazement
yes
my
father
is
john
smith
lord
luxellian
s
who
lives
under
the
park
wall
by
the
o
stephen
can
it
be
he
built
or
assisted
at
the
building
of
the
house
you
live
in
years
ago
he
put
up
those
stone
gate
piers
at
the
lodge
entrance
to
lord
luxellian
s
park
my
grandfather
planted
the
trees
that
belt
in
your
lawn
my
grandmother
who
worked
in
the
fields
with
him
held
each
tree
upright
whilst
he
filled
in
the
earth
they
told
me
so
when
i
was
a
child
he
was
the
sexton
too
and
dug
many
of
the
graves
around
and
was
your
unaccountable
vanishing
on
the
first
morning
of
your
arrival
and
again
this
afternoon
a
run
to
see
your
father
and
mother
i
understand
now
no
wonder
you
seemed
to
know
your
way
about
the
village
no
wonder
but
remember
i
have
not
lived
here
since
i
was
nine
years
old
i
then
went
to
live
with
my
uncle
a
blacksmith
near
exonbury
in
order
to
be
able
to
attend
a
national
school
as
a
day
scholar
there
was
none
on
this
remote
coast
then
it
was
there
i
met
with
my
friend
knight
and
when
i
was
fifteen
and
had
been
fairly
educated
by
the
and
more
particularly
by
knight
i
was
put
as
a
pupil
in
an
architect
s
office
in
that
town
because
i
was
skilful
in
the
use
of
the
pencil
a
full
premium
was
paid
by
the
efforts
of
my
mother
and
father
rather
against
the
wishes
of
lord
luxellian
who
likes
my
father
however
and
thinks
a
great
deal
of
him
there
i
stayed
till
six
months
ago
when
i
obtained
a
situation
as
improver
as
it
is
called
in
a
london
office
that
s
all
of
to
think
you
the
london
visitor
the
town
man
should
have
been
born
here
and
have
known
this
village
so
many
years
before
i
did
how
strange
how
very
strange
it
seems
to
me
she
murmured
my
mother
curtseyed
to
you
and
your
father
last
sunday
said
stephen
with
a
pained
smile
at
the
thought
of
the
incongruity
and
your
papa
said
to
her
i
am
glad
to
see
you
so
regular
at
church
i
remember
it
but
i
have
never
spoken
to
her
we
have
only
been
here
eighteen
months
and
the
parish
is
so
contrast
with
this
said
stephen
with
a
miserable
laugh
your
father
s
belief
in
my
blue
blood
which
is
still
prevalent
in
his
mind
the
first
night
i
came
he
insisted
upon
proving
my
descent
from
one
of
the
most
ancient
families
on
account
of
my
second
christian
name
when
the
truth
is
it
was
given
me
because
my
grandfather
was
assistant
gardener
in
the
family
for
thirty
years
having
seen
your
face
my
darling
i
had
not
heart
to
contradict
him
and
tell
him
what
would
have
cut
me
off
from
a
friendly
knowledge
of
she
sighed
deeply
yes
i
see
now
how
this
inequality
may
be
made
to
trouble
us
she
murmured
and
continued
in
a
low
sad
whisper
i
wouldn
t
have
minded
if
they
had
lived
far
away
papa
might
have
consented
to
an
engagement
between
us
if
your
connection
had
been
with
villagers
a
hundred
miles
off
remoteness
softens
family
contrasts
but
he
will
not
like
o
stephen
stephen
what
can
i
do
do
he
said
tentatively
yet
with
heaviness
give
me
up
let
me
go
back
to
london
and
think
no
more
of
no
no
i
can
not
give
you
up
this
hopelessness
in
our
affairs
makes
me
care
more
for
you
see
what
did
not
strike
me
at
first
stephen
why
do
we
trouble
why
should
papa
object
an
architect
in
london
is
an
architect
in
london
who
inquires
there
nobody
we
shall
live
there
shall
we
not
why
need
we
be
so
alarmed
and
elfie
said
stephen
his
hopes
kindling
with
hers
knight
thinks
nothing
of
my
being
only
a
cottager
s
son
he
says
i
am
as
worthy
of
his
friendship
as
if
i
were
a
lord
s
and
if
i
am
worthy
of
his
friendship
i
am
worthy
of
you
am
i
not
elfride
i
not
only
have
never
loved
anybody
but
you
she
said
instead
of
giving
an
answer
but
i
have
not
even
formed
a
strong
friendship
such
as
you
have
for
knight
i
wish
you
hadn
t
it
diminishes
now
elfride
you
know
better
he
said
wooingly
and
had
you
really
never
any
sweetheart
at
all
none
that
was
ever
recognized
by
me
as
but
did
nobody
ever
love
you
yes
a
man
did
once
very
much
he
how
long
ago
oh
a
long
how
long
dearest
a
that
s
not
very
long
rather
disappointedly
i
said
long
not
very
and
did
he
want
to
marry
you
i
believe
he
did
but
i
didn
t
see
anything
in
him
he
was
not
good
enough
even
if
i
had
loved
may
i
ask
what
he
was
a
a
farmer
not
good
enough
how
much
better
than
my
family
stephen
murmured
where
is
he
now
he
continued
to
elfride
here
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
that
he
is
where
here
under
us
he
is
under
this
tomb
he
is
dead
and
we
are
sitting
on
his
elfie
said
the
young
man
standing
up
and
looking
at
the
tomb
how
odd
and
sad
that
revelation
seems
it
quite
depresses
me
for
the
stephen
i
didn
t
wish
to
sit
here
but
you
would
do
you
never
encouraged
him
never
by
look
word
or
sign
she
said
solemnly
he
died
of
consumption
and
was
buried
the
day
you
first
let
us
go
away
i
don
t
like
standing
by
him
even
if
you
never
loved
him
he
was
before
worries
make
you
unreasonable
she
half
pouted
following
stephen
at
the
distance
of
a
few
steps
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
told
you
before
we
sat
down
yes
let
us
chapter
ix
her
father
did
fume
oppressed
in
spite
of
themselves
by
a
foresight
of
impending
complications
elfride
and
stephen
returned
down
the
hill
hand
in
hand
at
the
door
they
paused
wistfully
like
children
late
at
school
women
accept
their
destiny
more
readily
than
men
elfride
had
now
resigned
herself
to
the
overwhelming
idea
of
her
lover
s
sorry
antecedents
stephen
had
not
forgotten
the
trifling
grievance
that
elfride
had
known
earlier
admiration
than
his
own
what
was
that
young
man
s
name
he
inquired
felix
jethway
a
widow
s
only
i
remember
the
she
hates
me
now
she
says
i
killed
stephen
mused
and
they
entered
the
porch
stephen
i
love
only
you
she
tremulously
whispered
he
pressed
her
fingers
and
the
trifling
shadow
passed
away
to
admit
again
the
mutual
and
more
tangible
trouble
the
study
appeared
to
be
the
only
room
lighted
up
they
entered
each
with
a
demeanour
intended
to
conceal
the
inconcealable
fact
that
reciprocal
love
was
their
dominant
chord
elfride
perceived
a
man
sitting
with
his
back
towards
herself
talking
to
her
father
she
would
have
retired
but
swancourt
had
seen
her
come
in
he
said
it
is
only
martin
cannister
come
for
a
copy
of
the
register
for
poor
martin
cannister
the
sexton
was
rather
a
favourite
with
elfride
he
used
to
absorb
her
attention
by
telling
her
of
his
strange
experiences
in
digging
up
after
long
years
the
bodies
of
persons
he
had
known
and
recognizing
them
by
some
little
sign
though
in
reality
he
had
never
recognized
any
he
had
shrewd
small
eyes
and
a
great
wealth
of
double
chin
which
compensated
in
some
measure
for
considerable
poverty
of
nose
the
appearance
of
a
slip
of
paper
in
cannister
s
hand
and
a
few
shillings
lying
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
denoted
that
the
business
had
been
transacted
and
the
tenor
of
their
conversation
went
to
show
that
a
summary
of
village
news
was
now
engaging
the
attention
of
parishioner
and
parson
cannister
stood
up
and
touched
his
forehead
over
his
eye
with
his
finger
in
respectful
salutation
of
elfride
gave
half
as
much
salute
to
stephen
whom
he
in
common
with
other
villagers
had
never
for
a
moment
recognized
then
sat
down
again
and
resumed
his
discourse
where
had
i
got
on
to
sir
to
driving
the
pile
said
swancourt
the
pile
twas
so
as
i
was
saying
nat
was
driving
the
pile
in
this
manner
as
i
might
here
cannister
held
his
scrupulously
vertical
with
his
left
hand
and
struck
a
blow
with
great
force
on
the
knob
of
the
stick
with
his
right
john
was
steadying
the
pile
so
as
i
might
here
he
gave
the
stick
a
slight
shake
and
looked
firmly
in
the
various
eyes
around
to
see
that
before
proceeding
further
his
listeners
well
grasped
the
subject
at
that
stage
well
when
nat
had
struck
some
blows
more
upon
the
pile
a
stopped
for
a
second
or
two
john
thinking
he
had
done
striking
put
his
hand
upon
the
top
o
the
pile
to
gie
en
a
pull
and
see
if
a
were
firm
in
the
cannister
spread
his
hand
over
the
top
of
the
stick
completely
covering
it
with
his
palm
well
so
to
speak
nat
hadn
t
maned
to
stop
striking
and
when
john
had
put
his
hand
upon
the
pile
the
beetle
oh
dreadful
said
elfride
the
beetle
was
already
coming
down
you
see
sir
nat
just
caught
sight
of
his
hand
but
couldn
t
stop
the
blow
in
time
down
came
the
beetle
upon
poor
john
smith
s
hand
and
squashed
en
to
a
dear
me
dear
me
poor
fellow
said
the
vicar
with
an
intonation
like
the
groans
of
the
wounded
in
a
pianoforte
performance
of
the
battle
of
john
smith
the
cried
stephen
hurriedly
ay
no
other
and
a
man
god
a
mighty
never
is
he
so
much
hurt
i
have
heard
said
swancourt
not
noticing
stephen
that
he
has
a
son
in
london
a
very
promising
young
oh
how
he
must
be
hurt
repeated
stephen
a
beetle
couldn
t
hurt
very
little
well
sir
t
ye
and
ye
sir
and
you
miss
i
m
cannister
had
been
making
unnoticeable
motions
of
withdrawal
and
by
the
time
this
farewell
remark
came
from
his
lips
he
was
just
outside
the
door
of
the
room
he
tramped
along
the
hall
stayed
more
than
a
minute
endeavouring
to
close
the
door
properly
and
then
was
lost
to
their
hearing
stephen
had
meanwhile
turned
and
said
to
the
vicar
please
excuse
me
this
evening
i
must
leave
john
smith
is
my
the
vicar
did
not
comprehend
at
first
what
did
you
say
he
inquired
john
smith
is
my
father
said
stephen
deliberately
a
surplus
tinge
of
redness
rose
from
swancourt
s
neck
and
came
round
over
his
face
the
lines
of
his
features
became
more
firmly
defined
and
his
lips
seemed
to
get
thinner
it
was
evident
that
a
series
of
little
circumstances
hitherto
unheeded
were
now
fitting
themselves
together
and
forming
a
lucid
picture
in
swancourt
s
mind
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
useless
further
explanation
on
stephen
s
part
indeed
the
vicar
said
in
a
voice
dry
and
without
inflection
this
being
a
word
which
depends
entirely
upon
its
tone
for
its
meaning
swancourt
s
enunciation
was
equivalent
to
no
expression
at
all
i
have
to
go
now
said
stephen
with
an
agitated
bearing
and
a
movement
as
if
he
scarcely
knew
whether
he
ought
to
run
off
or
stay
longer
on
my
return
sir
will
you
kindly
grant
me
a
few
minutes
private
conversation
certainly
though
antecedently
it
does
not
seem
possible
that
there
can
be
anything
of
the
nature
of
private
business
between
swancourt
put
on
his
straw
hat
crossed
the
into
which
the
moonlight
was
shining
and
stepped
out
of
the
french
window
into
the
verandah
it
required
no
further
effort
to
perceive
what
indeed
reasoning
might
have
foretold
as
the
natural
colour
of
a
mind
whose
pleasures
were
taken
amid
genealogies
good
dinners
and
patrician
reminiscences
that
swancourt
s
prejudices
were
too
strong
for
his
generosity
and
that
stephen
s
moments
as
his
friend
and
equal
were
numbered
or
had
even
now
ceased
stephen
moved
forward
as
if
he
would
follow
the
vicar
then
as
if
he
would
not
and
in
absolute
perplexity
whither
to
turn
himself
went
awkwardly
to
the
door
elfride
followed
lingeringly
behind
him
before
he
had
receded
two
yards
from
the
doorstep
unity
and
ann
the
housemaid
came
home
from
their
visit
to
the
village
have
you
heard
anything
about
john
smith
the
accident
is
not
so
bad
as
was
reported
is
it
said
elfride
intuitively
oh
no
the
doctor
says
it
is
only
a
bad
i
thought
so
cried
elfride
gladly
he
says
that
although
nat
believes
he
did
not
check
the
beetle
as
it
came
down
he
must
have
done
so
without
knowing
it
checked
it
very
considerably
too
for
the
full
blow
would
have
knocked
his
hand
abroad
and
in
reality
it
is
only
made
how
thankful
i
am
said
stephen
the
perplexed
unity
looked
at
him
with
her
mouth
rather
than
with
her
eyes
that
will
do
unity
said
elfride
magisterially
and
the
two
maids
passed
on
elfride
do
you
forgive
me
said
stephen
with
a
faint
smile
no
man
is
fair
in
love
and
he
took
her
fingers
lightly
in
his
own
with
her
head
thrown
sideways
in
the
greuze
attitude
she
looked
a
tender
reproach
at
his
doubt
and
pressed
his
hand
stephen
returned
the
pressure
threefold
then
hastily
went
off
to
his
father
s
cottage
by
the
wall
of
endelstow
park
elfride
what
have
you
to
say
to
this
inquired
her
father
coming
up
immediately
stephen
had
retired
with
feminine
quickness
she
grasped
at
any
straw
that
would
enable
her
to
plead
his
cause
he
had
told
me
of
it
she
faltered
so
that
it
is
not
a
discovery
in
spite
of
him
he
was
just
coming
in
to
tell
coming
to
tell
why
hadn
t
he
already
told
i
object
as
much
if
not
more
to
his
underhand
concealment
of
this
than
i
do
to
the
fact
itself
it
looks
very
much
like
his
making
a
fool
of
me
and
of
you
too
you
and
he
have
been
about
together
and
corresponding
together
in
a
way
i
don
t
at
all
approve
of
in
a
most
unseemly
way
you
should
have
known
how
improper
such
conduct
is
a
woman
can
t
be
too
careful
not
to
be
seen
alone
with
you
saw
us
papa
and
have
never
said
a
my
fault
of
course
my
fault
what
the
deuce
could
i
be
thinking
of
he
a
villager
s
son
and
we
swancourts
connections
of
the
luxellians
we
have
been
coming
to
nothing
for
centuries
and
now
i
believe
we
have
got
there
what
shall
i
next
invite
here
i
wonder
elfride
began
to
cry
at
this
very
unpropitious
aspect
of
affairs
o
papa
papa
forgive
me
and
him
we
care
so
much
for
one
another
papa
o
so
much
and
what
he
was
going
to
ask
you
is
if
you
will
allow
of
an
engagement
between
us
till
he
is
a
gentleman
as
good
as
you
we
are
not
in
a
hurry
dear
papa
we
don
t
want
in
the
least
to
marry
now
not
until
he
is
richer
only
will
you
let
us
be
engaged
because
i
love
him
so
and
he
loves
me
swancourt
s
feelings
were
a
little
touched
by
this
appeal
and
he
was
annoyed
that
such
should
be
the
case
certainly
not
he
replied
he
pronounced
the
inhibition
lengthily
and
sonorously
so
that
the
not
sounded
like
no
no
no
don
t
say
it
foh
a
fine
story
it
is
not
enough
that
i
have
been
deluded
and
disgraced
by
having
him
here
the
son
of
one
of
my
village
peasants
but
now
i
am
to
make
him
my
heavens
above
us
are
you
mad
elfride
you
have
seen
his
letters
come
to
me
ever
since
his
first
visit
papa
and
you
knew
they
were
a
sort
of
and
since
he
has
been
here
you
have
let
him
be
alone
with
me
almost
entirely
and
you
guessed
you
must
have
guessed
what
we
were
thinking
of
and
doing
and
you
didn
t
stop
him
next
to
comes
and
you
knew
it
would
come
to
that
the
vicar
parried
this
thrust
i
know
since
you
press
me
so
i
know
i
did
guess
some
childish
attachment
might
arise
between
you
i
own
i
did
not
take
much
trouble
to
prevent
it
but
i
have
not
particularly
countenanced
it
and
elfride
how
can
you
expect
that
i
should
now
it
is
impossible
no
father
in
england
would
hear
of
such
a
but
he
is
the
same
man
papa
the
same
in
every
particular
and
how
can
he
be
less
fit
for
me
than
he
was
before
he
appeared
a
young
man
with
friends
and
a
little
property
but
having
neither
he
is
another
you
inquired
nothing
about
him
i
went
by
hewby
s
introduction
he
should
have
told
me
so
should
the
young
man
himself
of
course
he
should
i
consider
it
a
most
dishonourable
thing
to
come
into
a
man
s
house
like
a
treacherous
but
he
was
afraid
to
tell
you
and
so
should
i
have
been
he
loved
me
too
well
to
like
to
run
the
risk
and
as
to
speaking
of
his
friends
on
his
first
visit
i
don
t
see
why
he
should
have
done
so
at
all
he
came
here
on
business
it
was
no
affair
of
ours
who
his
parents
were
and
then
he
knew
that
if
he
told
you
he
would
never
be
asked
here
and
would
perhaps
never
see
me
again
and
he
wanted
to
see
me
who
can
blame
him
for
trying
by
any
means
to
stay
near
me
the
girl
he
loves
all
is
fair
in
love
i
have
heard
you
say
so
yourself
papa
and
you
yourself
would
have
done
just
as
he
has
so
would
any
and
any
man
on
discovering
what
i
have
discovered
would
also
do
as
i
do
and
mend
my
mistake
that
is
get
shot
of
him
again
as
soon
as
the
laws
of
hospitality
will
but
swancourt
then
remembered
that
he
was
a
christian
i
would
not
for
the
world
seem
to
turn
him
out
of
doors
he
added
but
i
think
he
will
have
the
tact
to
see
that
he
can
not
stay
long
after
this
with
good
he
will
because
he
s
a
gentleman
see
how
graceful
his
manners
are
elfride
went
on
though
perhaps
stephen
s
manners
like
the
feats
of
euryalus
owed
their
attractiveness
in
her
eyes
rather
to
the
attractiveness
of
his
person
than
to
their
own
excellence
ay
anybody
can
be
what
you
call
graceful
if
he
lives
a
little
time
in
a
city
and
keeps
his
eyes
open
and
he
might
have
picked
up
his
gentlemanliness
by
going
to
the
galleries
of
theatres
and
watching
stage
manners
he
reminds
me
of
one
of
the
worst
stories
i
ever
heard
in
my
what
story
was
that
oh
no
thank
you
i
wouldn
t
tell
you
such
an
improper
matter
for
the
world
if
his
father
and
mother
had
lived
in
the
north
or
east
of
england
gallantly
persisted
elfride
though
her
sobs
began
to
interrupt
her
articulation
anywhere
but
here
you
would
have
only
regarded
him
and
not
them
his
station
would
have
been
what
his
profession
makes
it
and
not
fixed
by
his
father
s
humble
position
at
all
whom
he
never
lives
with
now
though
john
smith
has
saved
lots
of
money
and
is
better
off
than
we
are
they
say
or
he
couldn
t
have
put
his
son
to
such
an
expensive
profession
and
it
is
clever
and
honourable
of
stephen
to
be
the
best
of
his
yes
let
a
beast
be
lord
of
beasts
and
his
crib
shall
stand
at
the
king
s
you
insult
me
papa
she
burst
out
you
do
you
do
he
is
my
own
stephen
he
is
that
may
or
may
not
be
true
elfride
returned
her
father
again
uncomfortably
agitated
in
spite
of
himself
you
confuse
future
probabilities
with
present
facts
what
the
young
man
may
be
with
what
he
is
we
must
look
at
what
he
is
not
what
an
improbable
degree
of
success
in
his
profession
may
make
him
the
case
is
this
the
son
of
a
in
my
parish
who
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
buy
me
up
a
youth
who
has
not
yet
advanced
so
far
into
life
as
to
have
any
income
of
his
own
deserving
the
name
and
therefore
of
his
father
s
degree
as
regards
station
wants
to
be
engaged
to
you
his
family
are
living
in
precisely
the
same
spot
in
england
as
yours
so
throughout
this
county
which
is
the
world
to
us
you
would
always
be
known
as
the
wife
of
jack
smith
the
mason
s
son
and
not
under
any
circumstances
as
the
wife
of
a
london
professional
man
it
is
the
drawback
not
the
compensating
fact
that
is
talked
of
always
there
say
no
more
you
may
argue
all
night
and
prove
what
you
will
i
ll
stick
to
my
elfride
looked
silently
and
hopelessly
out
of
the
window
with
large
heavy
eyes
and
wet
cheeks
i
call
it
great
temerity
and
long
to
call
it
audacity
in
hewby
resumed
her
father
i
never
heard
such
a
thing
giving
such
a
hobbledehoy
native
of
this
place
such
an
introduction
to
me
as
he
did
naturally
you
were
deceived
as
well
as
i
was
i
don
t
blame
you
at
all
so
he
went
and
searched
for
hewby
s
original
letter
here
s
what
he
said
to
me
dear
sir
agreeably
to
your
request
of
the
instant
i
have
arranged
to
survey
and
make
drawings
et
cetera
my
assistant
stephen
smith
assistant
you
see
he
called
him
and
naturally
i
understood
him
to
mean
a
sort
of
partner
why
didn
t
he
say
clerk
they
never
call
them
clerks
in
that
profession
because
they
do
not
write
stephen
smith
told
me
so
so
that
hewby
simply
used
the
accepted
let
me
speak
please
elfride
my
assistant
stephen
smith
will
leave
london
by
the
early
train
morning
many
thanks
for
your
proposal
to
accommodate
him
you
may
put
every
confidence
in
him
and
may
rely
upon
his
discernment
in
the
matter
of
church
well
i
repeat
that
hewby
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
for
making
so
much
of
a
poor
lad
of
that
professional
men
in
london
elfride
argued
don
t
know
anything
about
their
clerks
fathers
and
mothers
they
have
assistants
who
come
to
their
offices
and
shops
for
years
and
hardly
even
know
where
they
live
what
they
can
do
what
profits
they
can
bring
the
firm
that
s
all
london
men
care
about
and
that
is
helped
in
him
by
his
faculty
of
being
uniformly
uniform
pleasantness
is
rather
a
defect
than
a
faculty
it
shows
that
a
man
hasn
t
sense
enough
to
know
whom
to
it
shows
that
he
acts
by
faith
and
not
by
sight
as
those
you
claim
succession
from
that
s
some
more
of
what
he
s
been
telling
you
i
suppose
yes
i
was
inclined
to
suspect
him
because
he
didn
t
care
about
sauces
of
any
kind
i
always
did
doubt
a
man
s
being
a
gentleman
if
his
palate
had
no
acquired
tastes
an
unedified
palate
is
the
irrepressible
cloven
foot
of
the
upstart
the
idea
of
my
bringing
out
a
bottle
of
my
martinez
only
eleven
of
them
left
now
to
a
man
who
didn
t
know
it
from
eighteenpenny
then
the
latin
line
he
gave
to
my
quotation
it
was
very
very
or
i
who
haven
t
looked
into
a
classical
author
for
the
last
eighteen
years
shouldn
t
have
remembered
it
well
elfride
you
had
better
go
to
your
room
you
ll
get
over
this
bit
of
tomfoolery
in
no
no
no
papa
she
moaned
for
of
all
the
miseries
attaching
to
miserable
love
the
worst
is
the
misery
of
thinking
that
the
passion
which
is
the
cause
of
them
all
may
cease
elfride
said
her
father
with
rough
friendliness
i
have
an
excellent
scheme
on
hand
which
i
can
not
tell
you
of
now
a
scheme
to
benefit
you
and
me
it
has
been
thrust
upon
me
for
some
little
time
yes
thrust
upon
me
but
i
didn
t
dream
of
its
value
till
this
afternoon
when
the
revelation
came
i
should
be
most
unwise
to
refuse
to
entertain
i
don
t
like
that
word
she
returned
wearily
you
have
lost
so
much
already
by
schemes
is
it
those
wretched
mines
again
no
not
a
mining
railways
nor
railways
it
is
like
those
mysterious
offers
we
see
advertised
by
which
any
gentleman
with
no
brains
at
all
may
make
so
much
a
week
without
risk
trouble
or
soiling
his
fingers
however
i
am
intending
to
say
nothing
till
it
is
settled
though
i
will
just
say
this
much
that
you
soon
may
have
other
fish
to
fry
than
to
think
of
stephen
smith
remember
i
wish
not
to
be
angry
but
friendly
to
the
young
man
for
your
sake
i
ll
regard
him
as
a
friend
in
a
certain
sense
but
this
is
enough
in
a
few
days
you
will
be
quite
my
way
of
thinking
there
now
go
to
your
bedroom
unity
shall
bring
you
up
some
supper
i
wish
you
not
to
be
here
when
he
comes
chapter
x
beneath
the
shelter
of
an
aged
stephen
retraced
his
steps
towards
the
cottage
he
had
visited
only
two
or
three
hours
previously
he
drew
near
and
under
the
rich
foliage
growing
about
the
outskirts
of
endelstow
park
the
spotty
lights
and
shades
from
the
shining
moon
maintaining
a
race
over
his
head
and
down
his
back
in
an
endless
gambol
when
he
crossed
the
plank
bridge
and
entered
the
he
saw
an
illuminated
figure
coming
from
the
enclosed
plot
towards
the
house
on
the
other
side
it
was
his
father
with
his
hand
in
a
sling
taking
a
general
moonlight
view
of
the
garden
and
particularly
of
a
plot
of
the
youngest
of
young
turnips
previous
to
closing
the
cottage
for
the
night
he
saluted
his
son
with
customary
force
hallo
stephen
we
should
ha
been
in
bed
in
another
ten
minutes
come
to
see
what
s
the
matter
wi
me
i
suppose
my
lad
the
doctor
had
come
and
gone
and
the
hand
had
been
pronounced
as
injured
but
slightly
though
it
might
possibly
have
been
considered
a
far
more
serious
case
if
smith
had
been
a
more
important
man
stephen
s
anxious
inquiry
drew
from
his
father
words
of
regret
at
the
inconvenience
to
the
world
of
his
doing
nothing
for
the
next
two
days
rather
than
of
concern
for
the
pain
of
the
accident
together
they
entered
the
house
john
smith
brown
as
autumn
as
to
skin
white
as
winter
as
to
clothes
was
a
satisfactory
specimen
of
the
village
artificer
in
stone
in
common
with
most
rural
mechanics
he
had
too
much
individuality
to
be
a
typical
a
resultant
of
that
attrition
with
his
kind
only
to
be
experienced
in
large
towns
which
metamorphoses
the
unit
self
into
a
fraction
of
the
unit
class
there
was
not
the
speciality
in
his
labour
which
distinguishes
the
handicraftsmen
of
towns
though
only
a
mason
strictly
speaking
he
was
not
above
handling
a
brick
if
bricks
were
the
order
of
the
day
or
a
slate
or
tile
if
a
roof
had
to
be
covered
before
the
wet
weather
set
in
and
nobody
was
near
who
could
do
it
better
indeed
on
one
or
two
occasions
in
the
depth
of
winter
when
frost
peremptorily
forbids
all
use
of
the
trowel
making
foundations
to
settle
stones
to
fly
and
mortar
to
crumble
he
had
taken
to
felling
and
sawing
trees
moreover
he
had
practised
gardening
in
his
own
plot
for
so
many
years
that
on
an
emergency
he
might
have
made
a
living
by
that
calling
probably
our
countryman
was
not
such
an
accomplished
artificer
in
a
particular
direction
as
his
town
brethren
in
the
trades
but
he
was
in
truth
like
that
clumsy
who
made
the
whole
pin
and
who
was
despised
by
adam
smith
on
that
account
and
respected
by
macaulay
much
more
the
artist
nevertheless
appearing
now
indoors
by
the
light
of
the
candle
his
stalwart
healthiness
was
a
sight
to
see
his
beard
was
close
and
knotted
as
that
of
a
chiselled
hercules
his
shirt
sleeves
were
partly
rolled
up
his
waistcoat
unbuttoned
the
difference
in
hue
between
the
snowy
linen
and
the
ruddy
arms
and
face
contrasting
like
the
white
of
an
egg
and
its
yolk
smith
on
hearing
them
enter
advanced
from
the
pantry
smith
was
a
matron
whose
countenance
addressed
itself
to
the
mind
rather
than
to
the
eye
though
not
exclusively
she
retained
her
personal
freshness
even
now
in
the
prosy
of
her
life
but
what
her
features
were
primarily
indicative
of
was
a
sound
common
sense
behind
them
as
a
whole
appearing
to
carry
with
them
a
sort
of
argumentative
commentary
on
the
world
in
general
the
details
of
the
accident
were
then
rehearsed
by
stephen
s
father
in
the
dramatic
manner
also
common
to
martin
cannister
other
individuals
of
the
neighbourhood
and
the
rural
world
generally
smith
threw
in
her
sentiments
between
the
acts
as
coryphaeus
of
the
tragedy
to
make
the
description
complete
the
story
at
last
came
to
an
end
as
the
longest
will
and
stephen
directed
the
conversation
into
another
channel
well
mother
they
know
everything
about
me
now
he
said
quietly
well
done
replied
his
father
now
my
mind
s
at
i
blame
myself
i
never
shall
forgive
myself
for
not
telling
them
before
continued
the
young
man
smith
at
this
point
abstracted
her
mind
from
the
former
subject
i
don
t
see
what
you
have
to
grieve
about
stephen
she
said
people
who
accidentally
get
friends
don
t
as
a
first
stroke
tell
the
history
of
their
ye
ve
done
no
wrong
certainly
said
his
father
no
but
i
should
have
spoken
sooner
there
s
more
in
this
visit
of
mine
than
you
think
a
good
deal
not
more
than
i
think
smith
replied
looking
contemplatively
at
him
stephen
blushed
and
his
father
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
a
state
of
utter
incomprehension
she
s
a
pretty
piece
enough
smith
continued
and
very
and
clever
too
but
though
she
s
very
well
fit
for
you
as
far
as
that
is
why
mercy
pon
me
what
ever
do
you
want
any
woman
at
all
for
yet
john
made
his
naturally
short
mouth
a
long
one
and
wrinkled
his
forehead
that
s
the
way
the
wind
d
blow
is
it
he
said
mother
exclaimed
stephen
how
absurdly
you
speak
criticizing
whether
she
s
fit
for
me
or
no
as
if
there
were
room
for
doubt
on
the
matter
why
to
marry
her
would
be
the
great
blessing
of
my
life
socially
and
practically
as
well
as
in
other
respects
no
such
good
fortune
as
that
i
m
afraid
she
s
too
far
above
me
her
family
doesn
t
want
such
country
lads
as
i
in
then
if
they
don
t
want
you
i
d
see
them
dead
corpses
before
i
d
want
them
and
go
to
better
families
who
do
want
ah
yes
but
i
could
never
put
up
with
the
distaste
of
being
welcomed
among
such
people
as
you
mean
whilst
i
could
get
indifference
among
such
people
as
what
crazy
twist
o
thinking
will
enter
your
head
next
said
his
mother
and
come
to
that
she
s
not
a
bit
too
high
for
you
or
you
too
low
for
her
see
how
careful
i
be
to
keep
myself
up
i
m
sure
i
never
stop
for
more
than
a
minute
together
to
talk
to
any
journeymen
people
and
i
never
invite
anybody
to
our
party
o
christmases
who
are
not
in
business
for
themselves
and
i
talk
to
several
toppermost
carriage
people
that
come
to
my
lord
s
without
saying
ma
am
or
sir
to
em
and
they
take
it
as
quiet
as
you
curtseyed
to
the
vicar
mother
and
i
wish
you
hadn
but
it
was
before
he
called
me
by
my
christian
name
or
he
would
have
got
very
little
curtseying
from
me
said
smith
bridling
and
sparkling
with
vexation
you
go
on
at
me
stephen
as
if
i
were
your
worst
enemy
what
else
could
i
do
with
the
man
to
get
rid
of
him
banging
it
into
me
and
your
father
by
side
and
by
seam
about
his
greatness
and
what
happened
when
he
was
a
young
fellow
at
college
and
i
don
t
know
the
tongue
o
en
flopping
round
his
mouth
like
a
round
a
dairy
that
a
did
didn
t
he
john
that
s
about
the
size
o
t
replied
her
husband
every
woman
resumed
smith
if
she
marry
at
all
must
expect
a
of
a
rank
lower
than
her
father
the
men
have
gone
up
so
and
the
women
have
stood
still
every
man
you
meet
is
more
the
dand
than
his
father
and
you
are
just
level
wi
that
s
what
she
thinks
it
only
shows
her
sense
i
knew
she
was
after
ee
stephen
i
knew
after
me
good
lord
what
next
and
i
really
must
say
again
that
you
ought
not
to
be
in
such
a
hurry
and
wait
for
a
few
years
you
might
go
higher
than
a
bankrupt
pa
son
s
girl
the
fact
is
mother
said
stephen
impatiently
you
don
t
know
anything
about
it
i
shall
never
go
higher
because
i
don
t
want
to
nor
should
i
if
i
lived
to
be
a
hundred
as
to
you
saying
that
she
s
after
me
i
don
t
like
such
a
remark
about
her
for
it
implies
a
scheming
woman
and
a
man
worth
scheming
for
both
of
which
are
not
only
untrue
but
ludicrously
untrue
of
this
case
isn
t
it
so
father
i
m
afraid
i
don
t
understand
the
matter
well
enough
to
gie
my
opinion
said
his
father
in
the
tone
of
the
fox
who
had
a
cold
and
could
not
smell
she
couldn
t
have
been
very
backward
anyhow
considering
the
short
time
you
have
known
her
said
his
mother
well
i
think
that
five
years
hence
you
ll
be
plenty
young
enough
to
think
of
such
things
and
really
she
can
very
well
afford
to
wait
and
will
too
take
my
word
living
down
in
an
place
like
this
i
am
sure
she
ought
to
be
very
thankful
that
you
took
notice
of
her
she
d
most
likely
have
died
an
old
maid
if
you
hadn
t
turned
all
nonsense
said
stephen
but
not
aloud
a
nice
little
thing
she
is
smith
went
on
in
a
more
complacent
tone
now
that
stephen
had
been
talked
down
there
s
not
a
word
to
say
against
her
i
ll
own
i
see
her
sometimes
decked
out
like
a
horse
going
to
fair
and
i
admire
her
for
t
a
perfect
little
lady
but
people
can
t
help
their
thoughts
and
if
she
d
learnt
to
make
figures
instead
of
letters
when
she
was
at
school
twould
have
been
better
for
her
pocket
for
as
i
said
there
never
were
worse
times
for
such
as
she
than
now
now
mother
said
stephen
with
smiling
deprecation
but
i
will
said
his
mother
with
asperity
i
don
t
read
the
papers
for
nothing
and
i
know
men
all
move
up
a
stage
by
marriage
men
of
her
class
that
is
parsons
marry
squires
daughters
squires
marry
lords
daughters
lords
marry
dukes
daughters
dukes
marry
queens
daughters
all
stages
of
gentlemen
mate
a
stage
higher
and
the
lowest
stage
of
gentlewomen
are
left
single
or
marry
out
of
their
but
you
said
just
now
dear
mother
retorted
stephen
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
of
showing
his
mother
her
inconsistency
then
he
paused
well
what
did
i
say
and
smith
prepared
her
lips
for
a
new
campaign
stephen
regretting
that
he
had
begun
since
a
volcano
might
be
the
consequence
was
obliged
to
go
on
you
said
i
wasn
t
out
of
her
class
just
yes
there
there
that
s
you
that
s
my
own
flesh
and
blood
i
ll
warrant
that
you
ll
pick
holes
in
everything
your
mother
says
if
you
can
stephen
you
are
just
like
your
father
for
that
take
anybody
s
part
but
mine
whilst
i
am
speaking
and
talking
and
trying
and
slaving
away
for
your
good
you
are
waiting
to
catch
me
out
in
that
way
so
you
are
in
her
class
but
tis
what
her
people
would
call
marrying
out
of
her
class
don
t
be
so
quarrelsome
stephen
stephen
preserved
a
discreet
silence
in
which
he
was
imitated
by
his
father
and
for
several
minutes
nothing
was
heard
but
the
ticking
of
the
against
the
wall
i
m
sure
added
smith
in
a
more
philosophic
tone
and
as
a
terminative
speech
if
there
d
been
so
much
trouble
to
get
a
husband
in
my
time
as
there
is
in
these
days
when
you
must
make
a
of
a
man
to
get
en
to
hae
ye
i
d
have
trod
clay
for
bricks
before
i
d
ever
have
lowered
my
dignity
to
marry
or
there
s
no
bread
in
nine
the
discussion
now
dropped
and
as
it
was
getting
late
stephen
bade
his
parents
farewell
for
the
evening
his
mother
none
the
less
warmly
for
their
sparring
for
although
smith
and
stephen
were
always
contending
they
were
never
at
enmity
and
possibly
said
stephen
i
may
leave
here
altogether
i
don
t
know
so
that
if
i
shouldn
t
call
again
before
returning
to
london
don
t
be
alarmed
will
you
but
didn
t
you
come
for
a
fortnight
said
his
mother
and
haven
t
you
a
month
s
holiday
altogether
they
are
going
to
turn
you
out
then
not
at
all
i
may
stay
longer
i
may
go
if
i
go
you
had
better
say
nothing
about
my
having
been
here
for
her
sake
at
what
time
of
the
morning
does
the
carrier
pass
endelstow
lane
seven
o
and
then
he
left
them
his
thoughts
were
that
should
the
vicar
permit
him
to
become
engaged
to
hope
for
an
engagement
or
in
any
way
to
think
of
his
beloved
elfride
he
might
stay
longer
should
he
be
forbidden
to
think
of
any
such
thing
he
resolved
to
go
at
once
and
the
latter
even
to
young
hopefulness
seemed
the
more
probable
alternative
stephen
walked
back
to
the
vicarage
through
the
meadows
as
he
had
come
surrounded
by
the
soft
musical
purl
of
the
water
through
little
weirs
the
modest
light
of
the
moon
the
freshening
smell
of
the
dews
around
it
was
a
time
when
mere
seeing
is
meditation
and
meditation
peace
stephen
was
hardly
philosopher
enough
to
avail
himself
of
nature
s
offer
his
constitution
was
made
up
of
very
simple
particulars
was
one
which
rare
in
the
of
civilizations
seems
to
grow
abundant
as
a
nation
gets
older
individuality
fades
and
education
spreads
that
is
his
brain
had
extraordinary
receptive
powers
and
no
great
creativeness
quickly
acquiring
any
kind
of
knowledge
he
saw
around
him
and
having
a
plastic
adaptability
more
common
in
woman
than
in
man
he
changed
colour
like
a
chameleon
as
the
society
he
found
himself
in
assumed
a
higher
and
more
artificial
tone
he
had
not
many
original
ideas
and
yet
there
was
scarcely
an
idea
to
which
under
proper
training
he
could
not
have
added
a
respectable
he
saw
nothing
outside
himself
and
what
he
saw
within
was
a
weariness
to
his
flesh
yet
to
a
dispassionate
observer
his
pretensions
to
elfride
though
rather
premature
were
far
from
absurd
as
marriages
go
unless
the
accidental
proximity
of
simple
but
honest
parents
could
be
said
to
make
them
so
the
clock
struck
eleven
when
he
entered
the
house
elfride
had
been
waiting
with
scarcely
a
movement
since
he
departed
before
he
had
spoken
to
her
she
caught
sight
of
him
passing
into
the
study
with
her
father
she
saw
that
he
had
by
some
means
obtained
the
private
interview
he
desired
a
nervous
headache
had
been
growing
on
the
excitable
girl
during
the
absence
of
stephen
and
now
she
could
do
nothing
beyond
going
up
again
to
her
room
as
she
had
done
before
instead
of
lying
down
she
sat
again
in
the
darkness
without
closing
the
door
and
listened
with
a
beating
heart
to
every
sound
from
downstairs
the
servants
had
gone
to
bed
she
ultimately
heard
the
two
men
come
from
the
study
and
cross
to
the
where
supper
had
been
lingering
for
more
than
an
hour
the
door
was
left
open
and
she
found
that
the
meal
such
as
it
was
passed
off
between
her
father
and
her
lover
without
any
remark
save
commonplaces
as
to
cucumbers
and
melons
their
wholesomeness
and
culture
uttered
in
a
stiff
and
formal
way
it
seemed
to
prefigure
failure
shortly
afterwards
stephen
came
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
and
was
almost
immediately
followed
by
her
father
who
also
retired
for
the
night
not
inclined
to
get
a
light
she
partly
undressed
and
sat
on
the
bed
where
she
remained
in
pained
thought
for
some
time
possibly
an
hour
then
rising
to
close
her
door
previously
to
fully
unrobing
she
saw
a
streak
of
light
shining
across
the
landing
her
father
s
door
was
shut
and
he
could
be
heard
snoring
regularly
the
light
came
from
stephen
s
room
and
the
slight
sounds
also
coming
thence
emphatically
denoted
what
he
was
doing
in
the
perfect
silence
she
could
hear
the
closing
of
a
lid
and
the
clicking
of
a
lock
he
was
fastening
his
then
the
buckling
of
straps
and
the
click
of
another
key
he
was
securing
his
portmanteau
with
trebled
foreboding
she
opened
her
door
softly
and
went
towards
his
one
sensation
pervaded
her
to
distraction
stephen
her
handsome
youth
and
darling
was
going
away
and
she
might
never
see
him
again
except
in
secret
and
in
sadness
perhaps
never
more
at
any
rate
she
could
no
longer
wait
till
the
morning
to
hear
the
result
of
the
interview
as
she
had
intended
she
flung
her
round
her
tapped
lightly
at
his
door
and
whispered
stephen
he
came
instantly
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
tell
me
are
we
to
hope
he
replied
in
a
disturbed
whisper
and
a
tear
approached
its
outlet
though
none
fell
i
am
not
to
think
of
such
a
preposterous
thing
that
s
what
he
said
and
i
am
going
i
should
have
called
you
up
to
bid
you
but
he
didn
t
say
you
were
to
go
o
stephen
he
didn
t
say
that
no
not
in
words
but
i
can
not
oh
don
t
don
t
go
do
come
and
let
us
talk
let
us
come
down
to
the
for
a
few
minutes
he
will
hear
us
she
preceded
him
down
the
staircase
with
the
taper
light
in
her
hand
looking
unnaturally
tall
and
thin
in
the
long
she
wore
she
did
not
stop
to
think
of
the
propriety
or
otherwise
of
this
midnight
interview
under
such
circumstances
she
thought
that
the
tragedy
of
her
life
was
beginning
and
for
the
first
time
almost
felt
that
her
existence
might
have
a
grave
side
the
shade
of
which
enveloped
and
rendered
invisible
the
delicate
gradations
of
custom
and
punctilio
elfride
softly
opened
the
door
and
they
both
went
in
when
she
had
placed
the
candle
on
the
table
he
enclosed
her
with
his
arms
dried
her
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
and
kissed
their
lids
stephen
it
is
over
happy
love
is
over
and
there
is
no
more
sunshine
now
i
will
make
a
fortune
and
come
to
you
and
have
you
yes
i
will
papa
will
never
hear
of
it
never
never
you
don
t
know
him
i
do
he
is
either
biassed
in
favour
of
a
thing
or
prejudiced
against
it
argument
is
powerless
against
either
no
i
won
t
think
of
him
so
said
stephen
if
i
appear
before
him
some
time
hence
as
a
man
of
established
name
he
will
accept
me
i
know
he
will
he
is
not
a
wicked
no
he
is
not
wicked
but
you
say
some
time
hence
as
if
it
were
no
time
to
you
among
bustle
and
excitement
it
will
be
comparatively
a
short
time
perhaps
oh
to
me
it
will
be
its
real
length
trebled
every
summer
will
be
a
year
autumn
a
year
winter
a
year
o
stephen
and
you
may
forget
me
forget
that
was
and
is
the
real
sting
of
waiting
to
woman
the
remark
awoke
in
stephen
the
converse
fear
you
too
may
be
persuaded
to
give
me
up
when
time
has
made
me
fainter
in
your
memory
for
remember
your
love
for
me
must
be
nourished
in
secret
there
will
be
no
long
visits
from
me
to
support
you
circumstances
will
always
tend
to
obliterate
stephen
she
said
filled
with
her
own
misgivings
and
unheeding
his
last
words
there
are
beautiful
women
where
you
live
of
course
i
know
there
are
and
they
may
win
you
away
from
her
tears
came
visibly
as
she
drew
a
mental
picture
of
his
faithlessness
and
it
won
t
be
your
fault
she
continued
looking
into
the
candle
with
doleful
eyes
no
you
will
think
that
our
family
don
t
want
you
and
get
to
include
me
with
them
and
there
will
be
a
vacancy
in
your
heart
and
some
others
will
be
let
i
could
not
i
would
not
elfie
do
not
be
so
full
of
oh
yes
they
will
she
replied
and
you
will
look
at
them
not
caring
at
first
and
then
you
will
look
and
be
interested
and
after
a
while
you
will
think
ah
they
know
all
about
city
life
and
assemblies
and
coteries
and
the
manners
of
the
titled
and
poor
little
elfie
with
all
the
fuss
that
s
made
about
her
having
me
doesn
t
know
about
anything
but
a
little
house
and
a
few
cliffs
and
a
space
of
sea
far
and
then
you
ll
be
more
interested
in
them
and
they
ll
make
you
have
them
instead
of
me
on
purpose
to
be
cruel
to
me
because
i
am
silly
and
they
are
clever
and
hate
me
and
i
hate
them
too
yes
i
do
her
impulsive
words
had
power
to
impress
him
at
any
rate
with
the
recognition
of
the
uncertainty
of
all
that
is
not
accomplished
and
worse
than
that
general
feeling
there
of
course
remained
the
sadness
which
arose
from
the
special
features
of
his
own
case
however
remote
a
desired
issue
may
be
the
mere
fact
of
having
entered
the
groove
which
leads
to
it
cheers
to
some
extent
with
a
sense
of
accomplishment
had
swancourt
consented
to
an
engagement
of
no
less
length
than
ten
years
stephen
would
have
been
comparatively
cheerful
in
waiting
they
would
have
felt
that
they
were
somewhere
on
the
road
to
cupid
s
garden
but
with
a
possibility
of
a
shorter
probation
they
had
not
as
yet
any
prospect
of
the
beginning
the
zero
of
hope
had
yet
to
be
reached
swancourt
would
have
to
revoke
his
formidable
words
before
the
waiting
for
marriage
could
even
set
in
and
this
was
despair
i
wish
we
could
marry
now
murmured
stephen
as
an
impossible
fancy
so
do
i
said
she
also
as
if
regarding
an
idle
dream
tis
the
only
thing
that
ever
does
sweethearts
good
secretly
would
do
would
it
not
elfie
yes
secretly
would
do
secretly
would
indeed
be
best
she
said
and
went
on
reflectively
all
we
want
is
to
render
it
absolutely
impossible
for
any
future
circumstance
to
upset
our
future
intention
of
being
happy
together
not
to
begin
being
happy
exactly
he
murmured
in
a
voice
and
manner
the
counterpart
of
hers
to
marry
and
part
secretly
and
live
on
as
we
are
living
now
merely
to
put
it
out
of
anybody
s
power
to
force
you
away
from
me
or
you
away
from
me
or
me
from
you
it
is
possible
to
conceive
a
force
of
circumstance
strong
enough
to
make
any
woman
in
the
world
marry
against
her
will
no
conceivable
pressure
up
to
torture
or
starvation
can
make
a
woman
once
married
to
her
lover
anybody
else
s
now
up
to
this
point
the
idea
of
an
immediate
secret
marriage
had
been
held
by
both
as
an
untenable
hypothesis
wherewith
simply
to
beguile
a
miserable
moment
during
a
pause
which
followed
stephen
s
last
remark
a
fascinating
perception
then
an
alluring
conviction
flashed
along
the
brain
of
both
the
perception
was
that
an
immediate
marriage
could
be
contrived
the
conviction
that
such
an
act
in
spite
of
its
daring
its
fathomless
results
its
deceptiveness
would
be
preferred
by
each
to
the
life
they
must
lead
under
any
other
conditions
the
youth
spoke
first
and
his
voice
trembled
with
the
magnitude
of
the
conception
he
was
cherishing
how
strong
we
should
feel
elfride
going
on
our
separate
courses
as
before
without
the
fear
of
ultimate
separation
o
elfride
think
of
it
think
of
it
it
is
certain
that
the
young
girl
s
love
for
stephen
received
a
fanning
from
her
father
s
opposition
which
made
it
blaze
with
a
dozen
times
the
intensity
it
would
have
exhibited
if
left
alone
never
were
conditions
more
favourable
for
developing
a
girl
s
first
passing
fancy
for
a
handsome
boyish
face
a
fancy
rooted
in
inexperience
and
nourished
by
seclusion
into
a
wild
unreflecting
passion
fervid
enough
for
anything
all
the
elements
of
such
a
development
were
there
the
chief
one
being
hopelessness
a
necessary
ingredient
always
to
perfect
the
mixture
of
feelings
united
under
the
name
of
loving
to
distraction
we
would
tell
papa
soon
would
we
not
she
inquired
timidly
nobody
else
need
know
he
would
then
be
convinced
that
hearts
can
not
be
played
with
love
encouraged
be
ready
to
grow
love
discouraged
be
ready
to
die
at
a
moment
s
notice
stephen
do
you
not
think
that
if
marriages
against
a
parent
s
consent
are
ever
justifiable
they
are
when
young
people
have
been
favoured
up
to
a
point
as
we
have
and
then
have
had
that
favour
suddenly
withdrawn
yes
it
is
not
as
if
we
had
from
the
beginning
acted
in
opposition
to
your
papa
s
wishes
only
think
elfie
how
pleasant
he
was
towards
me
but
six
hours
ago
he
liked
me
praised
me
never
objected
to
my
being
alone
with
i
believe
he
must
like
you
now
she
cried
and
if
he
found
that
you
irremediably
belonged
to
me
he
would
own
it
and
help
you
o
stephen
stephen
she
burst
out
again
as
the
remembrance
of
his
packing
came
afresh
to
her
mind
i
can
not
bear
your
going
away
like
this
it
is
too
dreadful
all
i
have
been
expecting
miserably
killed
within
me
like
this
stephen
flushed
hot
with
impulse
i
will
not
be
a
doubt
to
you
thought
of
you
shall
not
be
a
misery
to
me
he
said
we
will
be
wife
and
husband
before
we
part
for
long
she
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
anything
to
make
sure
she
whispered
i
did
not
like
to
propose
it
immediately
continued
stephen
it
seemed
to
me
it
seems
to
me
now
like
trying
to
catch
you
a
girl
better
in
the
world
than
not
that
indeed
and
am
i
better
in
worldly
station
what
s
the
use
of
have
beens
we
may
have
been
something
once
we
are
nothing
then
they
whispered
long
and
earnestly
together
stephen
hesitatingly
proposing
this
and
that
plan
elfride
modifying
them
with
quick
breathings
and
hectic
flush
and
unnaturally
bright
eyes
it
was
two
o
clock
before
an
arrangement
was
finally
concluded
she
then
told
him
to
leave
her
giving
him
his
light
to
go
up
to
his
own
room
they
parted
with
an
agreement
not
to
meet
again
in
the
morning
after
his
door
had
been
some
time
closed
he
heard
her
softly
gliding
into
her
chamber
chapter
xi
journeys
end
in
lovers
stephen
lay
watching
the
great
bear
elfride
was
regarding
a
monotonous
parallelogram
of
window
blind
neither
slept
that
night
early
the
next
morning
that
is
to
say
four
hours
after
their
stolen
interview
and
just
as
the
earliest
servant
was
heard
moving
about
stephen
smith
went
downstairs
portmanteau
in
hand
throughout
the
night
he
had
intended
to
see
swancourt
again
but
the
sharp
rebuff
of
the
previous
evening
rendered
such
an
interview
particularly
distasteful
perhaps
there
was
another
and
less
honest
reason
he
decided
to
put
it
off
whatever
of
moral
timidity
or
obliquity
may
have
lain
in
such
a
decision
no
perception
of
it
was
strong
enough
to
detain
him
he
wrote
a
note
in
his
room
which
stated
simply
that
he
did
not
feel
happy
in
the
house
after
swancourt
s
sudden
veto
on
what
he
had
favoured
a
few
hours
before
but
that
he
hoped
a
time
would
come
and
that
soon
when
his
original
feelings
of
pleasure
as
swancourt
s
guest
might
be
recovered
he
expected
to
find
the
downstairs
rooms
wearing
the
gray
and
cheerless
aspect
that
early
morning
gives
to
everything
out
of
the
sun
he
found
in
the
dining
room
a
breakfast
laid
of
which
somebody
had
just
partaken
stephen
gave
the
his
note
of
adieu
she
stated
that
swancourt
had
risen
early
that
morning
and
made
an
early
breakfast
he
was
not
going
away
that
she
knew
of
stephen
took
a
cup
of
coffee
left
the
house
of
his
love
and
turned
into
the
lane
it
was
so
early
that
the
shaded
places
still
smelt
like
night
time
and
the
sunny
spots
had
hardly
felt
the
sun
the
horizontal
rays
made
every
shallow
dip
in
the
ground
to
show
as
a
hollow
even
the
channel
of
the
path
was
enough
to
throw
shade
and
the
very
stones
of
the
road
cast
tapering
dashes
of
darkness
westward
as
long
as
jael
s
at
a
spot
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
the
vicar
s
residence
the
lane
leading
thence
crossed
the
high
road
stephen
reached
the
point
of
intersection
stood
still
and
listened
nothing
could
be
heard
save
the
lengthy
murmuring
line
of
the
sea
upon
the
adjacent
shore
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
then
mounted
a
gate
upon
which
he
seated
himself
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
carrier
whilst
he
sat
he
heard
wheels
coming
in
two
directions
the
vehicle
approaching
on
his
right
he
soon
recognized
as
the
carrier
s
there
were
the
accompanying
sounds
of
the
owner
s
voice
and
the
smack
of
his
whip
distinct
in
the
still
morning
air
by
which
he
encouraged
his
horses
up
the
hill
the
other
set
of
wheels
sounded
from
the
lane
stephen
had
just
traversed
on
closer
observation
he
perceived
that
they
were
moving
from
the
precincts
of
the
ancient
adjoining
the
vicarage
grounds
a
carriage
then
left
the
entrance
gates
of
the
house
and
wheeling
round
came
fully
in
sight
it
was
a
plain
travelling
carriage
with
a
small
quantity
of
luggage
apparently
a
lady
s
the
vehicle
came
to
the
junction
of
the
four
ways
before
the
carrier
reached
the
same
spot
and
crossed
directly
in
his
front
proceeding
by
the
lane
on
the
other
side
inside
the
carriage
stephen
could
just
discern
an
elderly
lady
with
a
younger
woman
who
seemed
to
be
her
maid
the
road
they
had
taken
led
to
stratleigh
a
small
sixteen
miles
north
he
heard
the
gates
swing
again
and
looking
up
saw
another
person
leaving
them
and
walking
off
in
the
direction
of
the
parsonage
ah
how
much
i
wish
i
were
moving
that
way
felt
he
parenthetically
the
gentleman
was
tall
and
resembled
swancourt
in
outline
and
attire
he
opened
the
vicarage
gate
and
went
in
swancourt
then
it
certainly
was
instead
of
remaining
in
bed
that
morning
swancourt
must
have
taken
it
into
his
head
to
see
his
new
neighbour
off
on
a
journey
he
must
have
been
greatly
interested
in
that
neighbour
to
do
such
an
unusual
thing
the
carrier
s
conveyance
had
pulled
up
and
stephen
now
handed
in
his
portmanteau
and
mounted
the
shafts
who
is
that
lady
in
the
carriage
he
inquired
indifferently
of
lickpan
the
carrier
that
sir
is
troyton
a
widder
wi
a
mint
o
money
she
s
the
owner
of
all
that
part
of
endelstow
that
is
not
lord
luxellian
s
only
been
here
a
short
time
she
came
into
it
by
law
the
owner
formerly
was
a
terrible
mysterious
party
never
lived
here
hardly
ever
was
seen
here
except
in
the
month
of
september
as
i
might
the
horses
were
started
again
and
noise
rendered
further
discourse
a
matter
of
too
great
exertion
stephen
crept
inside
under
the
tilt
and
was
soon
lost
in
reverie
three
hours
and
a
half
of
straining
up
hills
and
jogging
down
brought
them
to
launce
s
the
market
town
and
railway
station
nearest
to
endelstow
and
the
place
from
which
stephen
smith
had
journeyed
over
the
downs
on
the
to
him
memorable
winter
evening
at
the
beginning
of
the
same
year
the
carrier
s
van
was
so
timed
as
to
meet
a
starting
which
stephen
entered
two
or
three
hours
railway
travel
through
vertical
cuttings
in
metamorphic
rock
through
oak
copses
rich
and
green
stretching
over
slopes
and
down
delightful
valleys
glens
and
ravines
sparkling
with
water
like
ida
and
he
plunged
amid
the
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
people
composing
the
town
of
plymouth
there
being
some
time
upon
his
hands
he
left
his
luggage
at
the
and
went
on
foot
along
bedford
street
to
the
nearest
church
here
stephen
wandered
among
the
multifarious
tombstones
and
looked
in
at
the
chancel
window
dreaming
of
something
that
was
likely
to
happen
by
the
altar
there
in
the
course
of
the
coming
month
he
turned
away
and
ascended
the
hoe
viewed
the
magnificent
stretch
of
sea
and
massive
promontories
of
land
but
without
particularly
discerning
one
feature
of
the
varied
perspective
he
still
saw
that
inner
prospect
the
event
he
hoped
for
in
yonder
church
the
wide
sound
the
breakwater
the
on
eddystone
the
dark
steam
vessels
brigs
barques
and
schooners
either
floating
stilly
or
gliding
with
tiniest
motion
were
as
the
dream
then
the
event
was
as
the
reality
soon
stephen
went
down
from
the
hoe
and
returned
to
the
railway
station
he
took
his
ticket
and
entered
the
london
train
that
day
was
an
irksome
time
at
endelstow
vicarage
neither
father
nor
daughter
alluded
to
the
departure
of
stephen
swancourt
s
manner
towards
her
partook
of
the
compunctious
kindness
that
arises
from
a
misgiving
as
to
the
justice
of
some
previous
act
either
from
lack
of
the
capacity
to
grasp
the
whole
coup
d
oeil
or
from
a
natural
endowment
for
certain
kinds
of
stoicism
women
are
cooler
than
men
in
critical
situations
of
the
passive
form
probably
in
elfride
s
case
at
least
it
was
blindness
to
the
greater
contingencies
of
the
future
she
was
preparing
for
herself
which
enabled
her
to
ask
her
father
in
a
quiet
voice
if
he
could
give
her
a
holiday
soon
to
ride
to
launce
s
and
go
on
to
plymouth
now
she
had
only
once
before
gone
alone
to
plymouth
and
that
was
in
consequence
of
some
unavoidable
difficulty
being
a
country
girl
and
a
good
not
to
say
a
wild
horsewoman
it
had
been
her
delight
to
canter
without
the
ghost
of
an
attendant
over
the
fourteen
or
sixteen
miles
of
hard
road
intervening
between
their
home
and
the
station
at
launce
s
put
up
the
horse
and
go
on
the
remainder
of
the
distance
by
train
returning
in
the
same
manner
in
the
evening
it
was
then
resolved
that
though
she
had
successfully
accomplished
this
journey
once
it
was
not
to
be
repeated
without
some
attendance
but
elfride
must
not
be
confounded
with
ordinary
young
feminine
equestrians
the
circumstances
of
her
lonely
and
narrow
life
made
it
imperative
that
in
trotting
about
the
neighbourhood
she
must
trot
alone
or
else
not
at
all
usage
soon
rendered
this
perfectly
natural
to
herself
her
father
who
had
had
other
experiences
did
not
much
like
the
idea
of
a
swancourt
whose
pedigree
could
be
as
distinctly
traced
as
a
thread
in
a
skein
of
silk
scampering
over
the
hills
like
a
farmer
s
daughter
even
though
he
could
habitually
neglect
her
but
what
with
his
not
being
able
to
afford
her
a
regular
attendant
and
his
inveterate
habit
of
letting
anything
be
to
save
himself
trouble
the
circumstance
grew
customary
and
so
there
arose
a
chronic
notion
in
the
villagers
minds
that
all
ladies
rode
without
an
attendant
like
miss
swancourt
except
a
few
who
were
sometimes
visiting
at
lord
luxellian
s
i
don
t
like
your
going
to
plymouth
alone
particularly
going
to
launce
s
on
horseback
why
not
drive
and
take
the
man
it
is
not
nice
to
be
so
worm
s
company
would
not
seriously
have
interfered
with
her
plans
but
it
was
her
humour
to
go
without
him
when
do
you
want
to
go
said
her
father
she
only
answered
i
will
consider
he
said
only
a
few
days
elapsed
before
she
asked
again
a
letter
had
reached
her
from
stephen
it
had
been
timed
to
come
on
that
day
by
special
arrangement
between
them
in
it
he
named
the
earliest
morning
on
which
he
could
meet
her
at
plymouth
her
father
had
been
on
a
journey
to
stratleigh
and
returned
in
unusual
buoyancy
of
spirit
it
was
a
good
opportunity
and
since
the
dismissal
of
stephen
her
father
had
been
generally
in
a
mood
to
make
small
concessions
that
he
might
steer
clear
of
large
ones
connected
with
that
outcast
lover
of
hers
next
thursday
week
i
am
going
from
home
in
a
different
direction
said
her
father
in
fact
i
shall
leave
home
the
night
before
you
might
choose
the
same
day
for
they
wish
to
take
up
the
carpets
or
some
such
thing
i
think
as
i
said
i
don
t
like
you
to
be
seen
in
a
town
on
horseback
alone
but
go
if
you
thursday
week
her
father
had
named
the
very
day
that
stephen
also
had
named
that
morning
as
the
earliest
on
which
it
would
be
of
any
use
to
meet
her
that
was
about
fifteen
days
from
the
day
on
which
he
had
left
endelstow
fifteen
days
that
fragment
of
duration
which
has
acquired
such
an
interesting
individuality
from
its
connection
with
the
english
marriage
law
she
involuntarily
looked
at
her
father
so
strangely
that
on
becoming
conscious
of
the
look
she
paled
with
embarrassment
her
father
too
looked
confused
what
was
he
thinking
of
there
seemed
to
be
a
special
facility
offered
her
by
a
power
external
to
herself
in
the
circumstance
that
swancourt
had
proposed
to
leave
home
the
night
previous
to
her
day
her
father
seldom
took
long
journeys
seldom
slept
from
home
except
perhaps
on
the
night
following
a
remote
visitation
well
she
would
not
inquire
too
curiously
into
the
reason
of
the
opportunity
nor
did
he
as
would
have
been
natural
proceed
to
explain
it
of
his
own
accord
in
matters
of
fact
there
had
hitherto
been
no
reserve
between
them
though
they
were
not
usually
confidential
in
its
full
sense
but
the
divergence
of
their
emotions
on
stephen
s
account
had
produced
an
estrangement
which
just
at
present
went
even
to
the
extent
of
reticence
on
the
most
ordinary
household
topics
elfride
was
almost
unconsciously
relieved
persuading
herself
that
her
father
s
reserve
on
his
business
justified
her
in
secrecy
as
regarded
her
own
a
secrecy
which
was
necessarily
a
foregone
decision
with
her
so
anxious
is
a
young
conscience
to
discover
a
palliative
that
the
ex
post
facto
nature
of
a
reason
is
of
no
account
in
excluding
it
the
intervening
fortnight
was
spent
by
her
mostly
in
walking
by
herself
among
the
shrubs
and
trees
indulging
sometimes
in
sanguine
anticipations
more
far
more
frequently
in
misgivings
all
her
flowers
seemed
dull
of
hue
her
pets
seemed
to
look
wistfully
into
her
eyes
as
if
they
no
longer
stood
in
the
same
friendly
relation
to
her
as
formerly
she
wore
melancholy
jewellery
gazed
at
sunsets
and
talked
to
old
men
and
women
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
had
an
inner
and
private
world
apart
from
the
visible
one
about
her
she
wished
that
her
father
instead
of
neglecting
her
even
more
than
usual
would
make
some
advance
just
one
word
she
would
then
tell
all
and
risk
stephen
s
displeasure
thus
brought
round
to
the
youth
again
she
saw
him
in
her
fancy
standing
touching
her
his
eyes
full
of
sad
affection
hopelessly
renouncing
his
attempt
because
she
had
renounced
hers
and
she
could
not
recede
on
the
wednesday
she
was
to
receive
another
letter
she
had
resolved
to
let
her
father
see
the
arrival
of
this
one
be
the
consequences
what
they
might
the
dread
of
losing
her
lover
by
this
deed
of
honesty
prevented
her
acting
upon
the
resolve
five
minutes
before
the
postman
s
expected
arrival
she
slipped
out
and
down
the
lane
to
meet
him
she
met
him
immediately
upon
turning
a
sharp
angle
which
hid
her
from
view
in
the
direction
of
the
vicarage
the
man
smilingly
handed
one
missive
and
was
going
on
to
hand
another
a
circular
from
some
tradesman
no
she
said
take
that
on
to
the
why
miss
you
are
doing
what
your
father
has
done
for
the
last
she
did
not
comprehend
why
come
to
this
corner
and
take
a
letter
of
me
every
morning
all
writ
in
the
same
handwriting
and
letting
any
others
for
him
go
on
to
the
and
on
the
postman
went
no
sooner
had
he
turned
the
corner
behind
her
back
than
she
heard
her
father
meet
and
address
the
man
she
had
saved
her
letter
by
two
minutes
her
father
audibly
went
through
precisely
the
same
performance
as
she
had
just
been
guilty
of
herself
this
stealthy
conduct
of
his
was
to
say
the
least
peculiar
given
an
impulsive
inconsequent
girl
neglected
as
to
her
inner
life
by
her
only
parent
and
the
following
forces
alive
within
her
to
determine
a
resultant
first
love
acted
upon
by
a
deadly
fear
of
separation
from
its
object
inexperience
guiding
onward
a
frantic
wish
to
prevent
the
issue
misgivings
as
to
propriety
met
by
hope
of
ultimate
exoneration
indignation
at
parental
inconsistency
in
first
encouraging
then
forbidding
a
chilling
sense
of
disobedience
overpowered
by
a
conscientious
inability
to
brook
a
breaking
of
plighted
faith
with
a
man
who
in
essentials
had
remained
unaltered
from
the
beginning
a
blessed
hope
that
opposition
would
turn
an
erroneous
judgement
a
bright
faith
that
things
would
mend
thereby
and
wind
up
well
probably
the
result
would
after
all
have
been
nil
had
not
the
following
few
remarks
been
made
one
day
at
breakfast
her
father
was
in
his
old
hearty
spirits
he
smiled
to
himself
at
stories
too
bad
to
tell
and
called
elfride
a
little
scamp
for
surreptitiously
preserving
some
blind
kittens
that
ought
to
have
been
drowned
after
this
expression
she
said
to
him
suddenly
if
smith
had
been
already
in
the
family
you
would
not
have
been
made
wretched
by
discovering
he
had
poor
relations
do
you
mean
in
the
family
by
marriage
he
replied
inattentively
and
continuing
to
peel
his
egg
the
accumulating
scarlet
told
that
was
her
meaning
as
much
as
the
affirmative
reply
i
should
have
put
up
with
it
no
doubt
swancourt
observed
so
that
you
would
not
have
been
driven
into
hopeless
melancholy
but
have
made
the
best
of
him
elfride
s
erratic
mind
had
from
her
youth
upwards
been
constantly
in
the
habit
of
perplexing
her
father
by
hypothetical
questions
based
on
absurd
conditions
the
present
seemed
to
be
cast
so
precisely
in
the
mould
of
previous
ones
that
not
being
given
to
syntheses
of
circumstances
he
answered
it
with
customary
complacency
if
he
were
allied
to
us
irretrievably
of
course
i
or
any
sensible
man
should
accept
conditions
that
could
not
be
altered
certainly
not
be
hopelessly
melancholy
about
it
i
don
t
believe
anything
in
the
world
would
make
me
hopelessly
melancholy
and
don
t
let
anything
make
you
so
i
won
t
papa
she
cried
with
a
serene
brightness
that
pleased
him
certainly
swancourt
must
have
been
far
from
thinking
that
the
brightness
came
from
an
exhilarating
intention
to
hold
back
no
longer
from
the
mad
action
she
had
planned
in
the
evening
he
drove
away
towards
stratleigh
quite
alone
it
was
an
unusual
course
for
him
at
the
door
elfride
had
been
again
almost
impelled
by
her
feelings
to
pour
out
all
why
are
you
going
to
stratleigh
papa
she
said
and
looked
at
him
longingly
i
will
tell
you
when
i
come
back
he
said
cheerily
not
before
then
elfride
thou
wilt
not
utter
what
thou
dost
not
know
and
so
far
will
i
trust
thee
gentle
she
was
repressed
and
hurt
i
will
tell
you
my
errand
to
plymouth
too
when
i
come
back
she
murmured
he
went
away
his
jocularity
made
her
intention
seem
the
lighter
as
his
indifference
made
her
more
resolved
to
do
as
she
liked
it
was
a
familiar
september
sunset
fragments
of
cloud
upon
an
sky
these
sunsets
used
to
tempt
her
to
walk
towards
them
as
any
beautiful
thing
tempts
a
near
approach
she
went
through
the
field
to
the
privet
hedge
clambered
into
the
middle
of
it
and
reclined
upon
the
thick
boughs
after
looking
westward
for
a
considerable
time
she
blamed
herself
for
not
looking
eastward
to
where
stephen
was
and
turned
round
ultimately
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
ground
a
peculiarity
was
observable
beneath
her
a
green
field
spread
itself
on
each
side
of
the
hedge
one
belonging
to
the
glebe
the
other
being
a
part
of
the
land
attached
to
the
adjoining
on
the
vicarage
side
she
saw
a
little
footpath
the
distinctive
and
altogether
exceptional
feature
of
which
consisted
in
its
being
only
about
ten
yards
long
it
terminated
abruptly
at
each
end
a
footpath
suddenly
beginning
and
suddenly
ending
coming
from
nowhere
and
leading
nowhere
she
had
never
seen
before
yes
she
had
on
second
thoughts
she
had
seen
exactly
such
a
path
trodden
in
the
front
of
barracks
by
the
sentry
and
this
recollection
explained
the
origin
of
the
path
here
her
father
had
trodden
it
by
pacing
up
and
down
as
she
had
once
seen
him
doing
sitting
on
the
hedge
as
she
sat
now
her
eyes
commanded
a
view
of
both
sides
of
it
and
a
few
minutes
later
elfride
looked
over
to
the
manor
side
here
was
another
sentry
path
it
was
like
the
first
in
length
and
it
began
and
ended
exactly
opposite
the
beginning
and
ending
of
its
neighbour
but
it
was
thinner
and
less
distinct
two
reasons
existed
for
the
difference
this
one
might
have
been
trodden
by
a
similar
weight
of
tread
to
the
other
exercised
a
less
number
of
times
or
it
might
have
been
walked
just
as
frequently
but
by
lighter
feet
probably
a
gentleman
from
had
he
been
passing
at
the
time
might
have
considered
the
latter
alternative
as
the
more
probable
elfride
thought
otherwise
so
far
as
she
thought
at
all
but
her
own
great
was
now
imminent
all
thoughts
inspired
by
casual
sights
of
the
eye
were
only
allowed
to
exercise
themselves
in
inferior
corners
of
her
brain
previously
to
being
banished
altogether
elfride
was
at
length
compelled
to
reason
practically
upon
her
undertaking
all
her
definite
perceptions
thereon
when
the
emotion
accompanying
them
was
abstracted
amounted
to
no
more
than
these
say
an
hour
and
to
ride
to
launce
s
say
half
an
hour
at
the
falcon
to
change
my
dress
say
two
hours
waiting
for
some
train
and
getting
to
plymouth
say
an
hour
to
spare
before
twelve
o
clock
total
time
from
leaving
endelstow
till
twelve
o
clock
five
hours
therefore
i
shall
have
to
start
at
no
surprise
or
sense
of
unwontedness
entered
the
minds
of
the
servants
at
her
early
ride
the
monotony
of
life
we
associate
with
people
of
small
incomes
in
districts
out
of
the
sound
of
the
railway
whistle
has
one
exception
which
puts
into
shade
the
experience
of
dwellers
about
the
great
centres
of
population
that
is
in
travelling
every
journey
there
is
more
or
less
an
adventure
adventurous
hours
are
necessarily
chosen
for
the
most
commonplace
outing
miss
elfride
had
to
leave
early
that
was
all
elfride
never
went
out
on
horseback
but
she
brought
home
something
something
found
or
something
bought
if
she
trotted
to
town
or
village
her
burden
was
books
if
to
hills
woods
or
the
seashore
it
was
wonderful
mosses
abnormal
twigs
a
handkerchief
of
wet
shells
or
seaweed
once
in
muddy
weather
when
pansy
was
walking
with
her
down
the
street
of
castle
boterel
on
a
a
packet
in
front
of
her
and
a
packet
under
her
arm
an
accident
befell
the
packets
and
they
slipped
down
on
one
side
of
her
three
volumes
of
fiction
lay
kissing
the
mud
on
the
other
numerous
skeins
of
polychromatic
wools
lay
absorbing
it
unpleasant
women
smiled
through
windows
at
the
mishap
the
men
all
looked
round
and
a
boy
who
was
minding
a
stall
whilst
the
owner
had
gone
to
get
drunk
laughed
loudly
the
blue
eyes
turned
to
sapphires
and
the
cheeks
crimsoned
with
vexation
after
that
misadventure
she
set
her
wits
to
work
and
was
ingenious
enough
to
invent
an
arrangement
of
small
straps
about
the
saddle
by
which
a
great
deal
could
be
safely
carried
thereon
in
a
small
compass
here
she
now
spread
out
and
fastened
a
plain
dark
and
a
few
other
trifles
of
apparel
worm
opened
the
gate
for
her
and
she
vanished
away
one
of
the
brightest
mornings
of
late
summer
shone
upon
her
the
heather
was
at
its
purplest
the
furze
at
its
yellowest
the
grasshoppers
chirped
loud
enough
for
birds
the
snakes
hissed
like
little
engines
and
elfride
at
first
felt
lively
sitting
at
ease
upon
pansy
in
her
orthodox
and
nondescript
hat
she
looked
what
she
felt
but
the
mercury
of
those
days
had
a
trick
of
falling
unexpectedly
first
only
for
one
minute
in
ten
had
she
a
sense
of
depression
then
a
large
cloud
that
had
been
hanging
in
the
north
like
a
black
fleece
came
and
placed
itself
between
her
and
the
sun
it
helped
on
what
was
already
inevitable
and
she
sank
into
a
uniformity
of
sadness
she
turned
in
the
saddle
and
looked
back
they
were
now
on
an
open
whose
altitude
still
gave
her
a
view
of
the
sea
by
endelstow
she
looked
longingly
at
that
spot
during
this
little
revulsion
of
feeling
pansy
had
been
still
advancing
and
elfride
felt
it
would
be
absurd
to
turn
her
little
mare
s
head
the
other
way
still
she
thought
if
i
had
a
mamma
at
home
i
would
go
back
and
making
one
of
those
stealthy
movements
by
which
women
let
their
hearts
juggle
with
their
brains
she
did
put
the
horse
s
head
about
as
if
unconsciously
and
went
at
a
towards
home
for
more
than
a
mile
by
this
time
from
the
inveterate
habit
of
valuing
what
we
have
renounced
directly
the
alternative
is
chosen
the
thought
of
her
forsaken
stephen
recalled
her
and
she
turned
about
and
cantered
on
to
launce
s
again
this
miserable
strife
of
thought
now
began
to
rage
in
all
its
wildness
overwrought
and
trembling
she
dropped
the
rein
upon
pansy
s
shoulders
and
vowed
she
would
be
led
whither
the
horse
would
take
her
pansy
slackened
her
pace
to
a
walk
and
walked
on
with
her
agitated
burden
for
three
or
four
minutes
at
the
expiration
of
this
time
they
had
come
to
a
little
on
the
right
leading
down
a
slope
to
a
pool
of
water
the
pony
stopped
looked
towards
the
pool
and
then
advanced
and
stooped
to
drink
elfride
looked
at
her
watch
and
discovered
that
if
she
were
going
to
reach
launce
s
early
enough
to
change
her
dress
at
the
falcon
and
get
a
chance
of
some
early
train
to
plymouth
there
were
only
two
available
it
was
necessary
to
proceed
at
once
she
was
impatient
it
seemed
as
if
pansy
would
never
stop
drinking
and
the
repose
of
the
pool
the
idle
motions
of
the
insects
and
flies
upon
it
the
placid
waving
of
the
flags
the
like
genoese
filigree
placidly
sleeping
at
the
bottom
by
their
contrast
with
her
own
turmoil
made
her
impatience
greater
pansy
did
turn
at
last
and
went
up
the
slope
again
to
the
the
pony
came
upon
it
and
stood
looking
up
and
down
elfride
s
heart
throbbed
erratically
and
she
thought
horses
if
left
to
themselves
make
for
where
they
are
best
fed
pansy
will
go
pansy
turned
and
walked
on
towards
launce
s
pansy
at
home
during
summer
had
little
but
grass
to
live
on
after
a
run
to
launce
s
she
always
had
a
feed
of
corn
to
support
her
on
the
return
journey
therefore
being
now
more
than
half
way
she
preferred
launce
s
but
elfride
did
not
remember
this
now
all
she
cared
to
recognize
was
a
dreamy
fancy
that
s
rash
action
was
not
her
own
she
was
disabled
by
her
moods
and
it
seemed
indispensable
to
adhere
to
the
programme
so
strangely
involved
are
motives
that
more
than
by
her
promise
to
stephen
more
even
than
by
her
love
she
was
forced
on
by
a
sense
of
the
necessity
of
keeping
faith
with
herself
as
promised
in
the
inane
vow
of
ten
minutes
ago
she
hesitated
no
longer
pansy
went
like
the
steed
of
adonis
as
if
she
told
the
steps
presently
the
quaint
gables
and
jumbled
roofs
of
launce
s
were
spread
beneath
her
and
going
down
the
hill
she
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
falcon
buckle
the
landlady
came
to
the
door
to
meet
her
the
swancourts
were
well
known
here
the
transition
from
equestrian
to
the
ordinary
guise
of
railway
travellers
had
been
more
than
once
performed
by
father
and
daughter
in
this
establishment
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elfride
emerged
from
the
door
in
her
walking
dress
and
went
to
the
railway
she
had
not
told
buckle
anything
as
to
her
intentions
and
was
supposed
to
have
gone
out
shopping
an
hour
and
forty
minutes
later
and
she
was
in
stephen
s
arms
at
the
plymouth
station
not
upon
the
platform
in
the
secret
retreat
of
a
deserted
stephen
s
face
boded
ill
he
was
pale
and
despondent
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
we
can
not
be
married
here
my
elfie
i
ought
to
have
known
it
and
stayed
here
in
my
ignorance
i
did
not
i
have
the
licence
but
it
can
only
be
used
in
my
parish
in
london
i
only
came
down
last
night
as
you
what
shall
we
do
she
said
blankly
there
s
only
one
thing
we
can
do
what
s
that
go
on
to
london
by
a
train
just
starting
and
be
married
there
passengers
for
the
take
their
seats
said
a
guard
s
voice
on
the
platform
will
you
go
elfride
i
in
three
minutes
the
train
had
moved
off
bearing
away
with
it
stephen
and
elfride
chapter
xii
adieu
she
cries
and
waved
her
lily
the
few
tattered
clouds
of
the
morning
enlarged
and
united
the
sun
withdrew
behind
them
to
emerge
no
more
that
day
and
the
evening
drew
to
a
close
in
drifts
of
rain
the
beat
like
duck
shot
against
the
window
of
the
containing
stephen
and
elfride
the
journey
from
plymouth
to
paddington
by
even
the
most
headlong
express
allows
quite
enough
leisure
for
passion
of
any
sort
to
cool
elfride
s
excitement
had
passed
off
and
she
sat
in
a
kind
of
stupor
during
the
latter
half
of
the
journey
she
was
aroused
by
the
clanging
of
the
maze
of
rails
over
which
they
traced
their
way
at
the
entrance
to
the
station
is
this
london
she
said
yes
darling
said
stephen
in
a
tone
of
assurance
he
was
far
from
feeling
to
him
no
less
than
to
her
the
reality
so
greatly
differed
from
the
prefiguring
she
peered
out
as
well
as
the
window
beaded
with
drops
would
allow
her
and
saw
only
the
lamps
which
had
just
been
lit
blinking
in
the
wet
atmosphere
and
rows
of
hideous
zinc
in
dim
relief
against
the
sky
she
writhed
uneasily
as
when
a
thought
is
swelling
in
the
mind
which
must
cause
much
pain
at
its
deliverance
in
words
elfride
had
known
no
more
about
the
stings
of
evil
report
than
the
native
knew
of
the
effects
of
crusoe
s
first
shot
now
she
saw
a
little
further
and
a
little
further
still
the
train
stopped
stephen
relinquished
the
soft
hand
he
had
held
all
the
day
and
proceeded
to
assist
her
on
to
the
platform
this
act
of
alighting
upon
strange
ground
seemed
all
that
was
wanted
to
complete
a
resolution
within
her
she
looked
at
her
betrothed
with
despairing
eyes
o
stephen
she
exclaimed
i
am
so
miserable
i
must
go
home
again
i
must
i
must
forgive
my
wretched
vacillation
i
don
t
like
it
here
nor
myself
nor
you
stephen
looked
bewildered
and
did
not
speak
will
you
allow
me
to
go
home
she
implored
i
won
t
trouble
you
to
go
with
me
i
will
not
be
any
weight
upon
you
only
say
you
will
agree
to
my
returning
that
you
will
not
hate
me
for
it
stephen
it
is
better
that
i
should
return
again
indeed
it
is
but
we
can
t
return
now
he
said
in
a
deprecatory
tone
i
must
i
will
how
when
do
you
want
to
go
now
can
we
go
at
once
the
lad
looked
hopelessly
along
the
platform
if
you
must
go
and
think
it
wrong
to
remain
dearest
said
he
sadly
you
shall
you
shall
do
whatever
you
like
my
elfride
but
would
you
in
reality
rather
go
now
than
stay
till
and
go
as
my
wife
yes
yes
much
anything
to
go
now
i
must
i
must
she
cried
we
ought
to
have
done
one
of
two
things
he
answered
gloomily
never
to
have
started
or
not
to
have
returned
without
being
married
i
don
t
like
to
say
it
elfride
indeed
i
don
t
but
you
must
be
told
this
that
going
back
unmarried
may
compromise
your
good
name
in
the
eyes
of
people
who
may
hear
of
they
will
not
and
i
must
o
elfride
i
am
to
blame
for
bringing
you
not
at
all
i
am
the
by
a
month
and
what
s
that
but
never
mind
that
he
looked
around
is
there
a
train
for
plymouth
he
inquired
of
a
guard
the
guard
passed
on
and
did
not
speak
is
there
a
train
for
plymouth
said
elfride
to
another
yes
miss
the
leaves
in
ten
minutes
you
have
come
to
the
wrong
platform
it
is
the
other
side
change
at
bristol
into
the
night
mail
down
that
staircase
and
under
the
they
ran
down
the
staircase
elfride
first
to
the
and
into
a
carriage
with
an
official
standing
beside
the
door
show
your
tickets
they
are
locked
in
men
about
the
platform
accelerate
their
velocities
till
they
fly
up
and
down
like
shuttles
in
a
loom
a
whistle
the
waving
of
a
flag
a
human
cry
a
steam
groan
and
away
they
go
to
plymouth
again
just
catching
these
words
as
they
glide
off
those
two
youngsters
had
a
near
run
for
it
and
no
mistake
elfride
found
her
breath
and
have
you
come
too
stephen
why
did
you
i
shall
not
leave
you
till
i
see
you
safe
at
launce
s
do
not
think
worse
of
me
than
i
am
and
then
they
rattled
along
through
the
night
back
again
by
the
way
they
had
come
the
weather
cleared
and
the
stars
shone
in
upon
them
their
two
or
three
sat
for
most
of
the
time
with
closed
eyes
stephen
sometimes
slept
elfride
alone
was
wakeful
and
palpitating
hour
after
hour
the
day
began
to
break
and
revealed
that
they
were
by
the
sea
red
rocks
overhung
them
and
receding
into
distance
grew
livid
in
the
blue
grey
atmosphere
the
sun
rose
and
sent
penetrating
shafts
of
light
in
upon
their
weary
faces
another
hour
and
the
world
began
to
be
busy
they
waited
yet
a
little
and
the
train
slackened
its
speed
in
view
of
the
platform
at
launce
s
she
shivered
and
mused
sadly
i
did
not
see
all
the
consequences
she
said
appearances
are
wofully
against
me
if
anybody
finds
me
out
i
am
i
suppose
then
appearances
will
speak
falsely
and
how
can
that
matter
even
if
they
do
i
shall
be
your
husband
sooner
or
later
for
certain
and
so
prove
your
stephen
once
in
london
i
ought
to
have
married
you
she
said
firmly
it
was
my
only
safe
defence
i
see
more
things
now
than
i
did
yesterday
my
only
remaining
chance
is
not
to
be
discovered
and
that
we
must
fight
for
most
they
stepped
out
elfride
pulled
a
thick
veil
over
her
face
a
woman
with
red
and
scaly
eyelids
and
glistening
eyes
was
sitting
on
a
bench
just
inside
the
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
elfride
with
an
expression
whose
force
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
but
the
meaning
of
which
was
not
clear
then
upon
the
carriage
they
had
left
she
seemed
to
read
a
sinister
story
in
the
scene
elfride
shrank
back
and
turned
the
other
way
who
is
that
woman
said
stephen
she
looked
hard
at
mrs
jethway
a
widow
and
mother
of
that
young
man
whose
tomb
we
sat
on
the
other
night
stephen
she
is
my
enemy
would
that
god
had
had
mercy
enough
upon
me
to
have
hidden
this
from
her
do
not
talk
so
hopelessly
he
remonstrated
i
don
t
think
she
recognized
i
pray
that
she
did
he
put
on
a
more
vigorous
mood
now
we
will
go
and
get
some
no
no
she
begged
i
can
not
eat
i
must
get
back
to
elfride
was
as
if
she
had
grown
years
older
than
stephen
now
but
you
have
had
nothing
since
last
night
but
that
cup
of
tea
at
i
can
t
eat
wine
and
biscuit
nor
tea
nor
coffee
a
glass
of
water
no
i
want
something
that
makes
people
strong
and
energetic
for
the
present
that
borrows
the
strength
of
for
use
leaving
without
any
at
all
for
that
matter
or
even
that
would
take
all
life
away
so
long
as
it
enabled
me
to
get
home
again
now
brandy
that
s
what
i
want
that
woman
s
eyes
have
eaten
my
heart
away
you
are
wild
and
you
grieve
me
darling
must
it
be
brandy
yes
if
you
how
much
i
don
t
know
i
have
never
drunk
more
than
a
teaspoonful
at
once
all
i
know
is
that
i
want
it
don
t
get
it
at
the
he
left
her
in
the
fields
and
went
to
the
nearest
inn
in
that
direction
presently
he
returned
with
a
small
flask
nearly
full
and
some
slices
of
thin
as
wafers
in
a
elfride
took
a
sip
or
two
it
goes
into
my
eyes
she
said
wearily
i
can
t
take
any
more
yes
i
will
i
will
close
my
eyes
ah
it
goes
to
them
by
an
inside
route
i
don
t
want
it
throw
it
however
she
could
eat
and
did
eat
her
chief
attention
was
concentrated
upon
how
to
get
the
horse
from
the
falcon
stables
without
suspicion
stephen
was
not
allowed
to
accompany
her
into
the
town
she
acted
now
upon
conclusions
reached
without
any
aid
from
him
his
power
over
her
seemed
to
have
departed
you
had
better
not
be
seen
with
me
even
here
where
i
am
so
little
known
we
have
begun
stealthily
as
thieves
and
we
must
end
stealthily
as
thieves
at
all
hazards
until
papa
has
been
told
by
me
myself
a
discovery
would
be
walking
and
gloomily
talking
thus
they
waited
till
nearly
nine
o
clock
at
which
time
elfride
thought
she
might
call
at
the
falcon
without
creating
much
surprise
behind
the
was
the
river
spanned
by
an
old
tudor
bridge
whence
the
road
diverged
in
two
directions
one
skirting
the
suburbs
of
the
town
and
winding
round
again
into
the
to
endelstow
beside
this
road
stephen
sat
and
awaited
her
return
from
the
falcon
he
sat
as
one
sitting
for
a
portrait
motionless
watching
the
chequered
lights
and
shades
on
the
the
children
playing
opposite
the
school
previous
to
entering
for
the
morning
lesson
the
reapers
in
a
field
afar
off
the
certainty
of
possession
had
not
come
and
there
was
nothing
to
mitigate
the
youth
s
gloom
that
increased
with
the
thought
of
the
parting
now
so
near
at
length
she
came
trotting
round
to
him
in
appearance
much
as
on
the
romantic
morning
of
their
visit
to
the
cliff
but
shorn
of
the
radiance
which
glistened
about
her
then
however
her
comparative
immunity
from
further
risk
and
trouble
had
considerably
composed
her
elfride
s
capacity
for
being
wounded
was
only
surpassed
by
her
capacity
for
healing
which
rightly
or
wrongly
is
by
some
considered
an
index
of
transientness
of
feeling
in
general
elfride
what
did
they
say
at
the
falcon
nothing
nobody
seemed
curious
about
me
they
knew
i
went
to
plymouth
and
i
have
stayed
there
a
night
now
and
then
with
miss
bicknell
i
rather
calculated
upon
and
now
parting
arose
like
a
death
to
these
children
for
it
was
imperative
that
she
should
start
at
once
stephen
walked
beside
her
for
nearly
a
mile
during
the
walk
he
said
sadly
elfride
hours
have
passed
and
the
thing
is
not
but
you
have
insured
that
it
shall
be
how
have
i
o
stephen
you
ask
how
do
you
think
i
could
marry
another
man
on
earth
after
having
gone
thus
far
with
you
have
i
not
shown
beyond
possibility
of
doubt
that
i
can
be
nobody
else
s
have
i
not
irretrievably
committed
myself
pride
has
stood
for
nothing
in
the
face
of
my
great
love
you
misunderstood
my
turning
back
and
i
can
not
explain
it
it
was
wrong
to
go
with
you
at
all
and
though
it
would
have
been
worse
to
go
further
it
would
have
been
better
policy
perhaps
be
assured
of
this
that
whenever
you
have
a
home
for
me
however
poor
and
humble
and
come
and
claim
me
i
am
she
added
bitterly
when
my
father
knows
of
this
day
s
work
he
may
be
only
too
glad
to
let
me
perhaps
he
may
then
insist
upon
our
marriage
at
once
stephen
answered
seeing
a
ray
of
hope
in
the
very
focus
of
her
remorse
i
hope
he
may
even
if
we
had
still
to
part
till
i
am
ready
for
you
as
we
elfride
did
not
reply
you
don
t
seem
the
same
woman
elfie
that
you
were
nor
am
i
but
go
back
and
she
reined
the
horse
for
parting
o
stephen
she
cried
i
feel
so
weak
i
don
t
know
how
to
meet
him
can
not
you
after
all
come
back
with
me
shall
i
come
elfride
paused
to
think
no
it
will
not
do
it
is
my
utter
foolishness
that
makes
me
say
such
words
but
he
will
send
for
say
to
him
continued
stephen
that
we
did
this
in
the
absolute
despair
of
our
minds
tell
him
we
don
t
wish
him
to
favour
us
only
to
deal
justly
with
us
if
he
says
marry
now
so
much
the
better
if
not
say
that
all
may
be
put
right
by
his
promise
to
allow
me
to
have
you
when
i
am
good
enough
for
you
which
may
be
soon
say
i
have
nothing
to
offer
him
in
exchange
for
his
treasure
the
more
sorry
i
but
all
the
love
and
all
the
life
and
all
the
labour
of
an
honest
man
shall
be
yours
as
to
when
this
had
better
be
told
i
leave
you
to
his
words
made
her
cheerful
enough
to
toy
with
her
position
and
if
ill
report
should
come
stephen
she
said
smiling
why
the
must
save
me
as
it
saved
virgins
in
george
s
time
from
the
poisonous
breath
of
the
dragon
there
forgive
me
for
forwardness
i
am
then
the
boy
and
girl
beguiled
themselves
with
words
of
only
own
wifie
god
bless
you
till
we
meet
again
till
we
meet
again
and
the
pony
went
on
and
she
spoke
to
him
no
more
he
saw
her
figure
diminish
and
her
blue
veil
grow
gray
saw
it
with
the
agonizing
sensations
of
a
slow
death
after
thus
parting
from
a
man
than
whom
she
had
known
none
greater
as
yet
elfride
rode
rapidly
onwards
a
tear
being
occasionally
shaken
from
her
eyes
into
the
road
what
yesterday
had
seemed
so
desirable
so
promising
even
trifling
had
now
acquired
the
complexion
of
a
tragedy
she
saw
the
rocks
and
sea
in
the
neighbourhood
of
endelstow
and
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
she
passed
a
field
behind
the
vicarage
she
heard
the
voices
of
unity
and
william
worm
they
were
hanging
a
carpet
upon
a
line
unity
was
uttering
a
sentence
that
concluded
with
when
miss
elfride
when
d
ye
expect
her
not
till
evening
now
she
s
safe
enough
at
miss
bicknell
s
bless
elfride
went
round
to
the
door
she
did
not
knock
or
ring
and
seeing
nobody
to
take
the
horse
elfride
led
her
round
to
the
yard
slipped
off
the
bridle
and
saddle
drove
her
towards
the
paddock
and
turned
her
in
then
elfride
crept
indoors
and
looked
into
all
the
rooms
her
father
was
not
there
on
the
mantelpiece
of
the
stood
a
letter
addressed
to
her
in
his
handwriting
she
took
it
and
read
it
as
she
went
upstairs
to
change
her
habit
stratleigh
thursday
dear
elfride
on
second
thoughts
i
will
not
return
but
only
come
as
far
as
wadcombe
i
shall
be
at
home
by
afternoon
and
bring
a
friend
with
yours
in
haste
after
making
a
quick
toilet
she
felt
more
revived
though
still
suffering
from
a
headache
on
going
out
of
the
door
she
met
unity
at
the
top
of
the
stair
o
miss
elfride
i
said
to
myself
tis
her
sperrit
we
didn
t
dream
o
you
not
coming
home
last
night
you
didn
t
say
anything
about
i
intended
to
come
home
the
same
evening
but
altered
my
plan
i
wished
i
hadn
t
afterwards
papa
will
be
angry
i
suppose
better
not
tell
him
miss
said
unity
i
do
fear
to
she
murmured
unity
would
you
just
begin
telling
him
when
he
comes
home
what
and
get
you
into
trouble
i
deserve
no
indeed
i
won
t
said
unity
it
is
not
such
a
mighty
matter
miss
elfride
i
says
to
myself
master
s
taking
a
hollerday
and
because
he
s
not
been
kind
lately
to
miss
elfride
she
is
imitating
him
well
do
as
you
like
and
will
you
now
bring
me
some
luncheon
after
satisfying
an
appetite
which
the
fresh
marine
air
had
given
her
in
its
victory
over
an
agitated
mind
she
put
on
her
hat
and
went
to
the
garden
and
she
sat
down
and
leant
with
her
head
in
a
corner
here
she
fell
asleep
she
hurriedly
looked
at
the
time
she
had
been
there
three
hours
at
the
same
moment
she
heard
the
outer
gate
swing
together
and
wheels
sweep
round
the
entrance
some
prior
noise
from
the
same
source
having
probably
been
the
cause
of
her
awaking
next
her
father
s
voice
was
heard
calling
to
worm
elfride
passed
along
a
walk
towards
the
house
behind
a
belt
of
shrubs
she
heard
a
tongue
holding
converse
with
her
father
which
was
not
that
of
either
of
the
servants
her
father
and
the
stranger
were
laughing
together
then
there
was
a
rustling
of
silk
and
swancourt
and
his
companion
or
companions
to
all
seeming
entered
the
door
of
the
house
for
nothing
more
of
them
was
audible
elfride
had
turned
back
to
meditate
on
what
friends
these
could
be
when
she
heard
footsteps
and
her
father
exclaiming
behind
her
o
elfride
here
you
are
i
hope
you
got
on
well
elfride
s
heart
smote
her
and
she
did
not
speak
come
back
to
the
a
minute
continued
swancourt
i
have
to
tell
you
of
that
i
promised
they
entered
the
and
stood
leaning
over
the
knotty
woodwork
of
the
balustrade
now
said
her
father
radiantly
guess
what
i
have
to
he
seemed
to
be
regarding
his
own
existence
so
intently
that
he
took
no
interest
in
nor
even
saw
the
complexion
of
hers
i
can
not
papa
she
said
sadly
try
i
would
rather
not
you
are
tired
you
look
worn
the
ride
was
too
much
for
you
well
this
is
what
i
went
away
for
i
went
to
be
married
married
she
faltered
and
could
hardly
check
an
involuntary
so
did
a
moment
after
and
her
resolve
to
confess
perished
like
a
bubble
yes
to
whom
do
you
think
troyton
the
new
owner
of
the
estate
over
the
hedge
and
of
the
old
it
was
only
finally
settled
between
us
when
i
went
to
stratleigh
a
few
days
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
sly
tone
of
merriment
now
as
to
your
stepmother
you
ll
find
she
is
not
much
to
look
at
though
a
good
deal
to
listen
to
she
is
twenty
years
older
than
myself
for
one
you
forget
that
i
know
her
she
called
here
once
after
we
had
been
and
found
her
away
from
of
course
of
course
well
whatever
her
looks
are
she
s
as
excellent
a
woman
as
ever
breathed
she
has
had
lately
left
her
as
absolute
property
three
thousand
five
hundred
a
year
besides
the
devise
of
this
estate
and
by
the
way
a
large
legacy
came
to
her
in
satisfaction
of
dower
as
it
is
three
thousand
five
hundred
a
year
and
a
large
well
a
mansion
in
town
and
a
pedigree
as
long
as
my
though
that
bears
evidence
of
being
rather
a
affair
done
since
the
family
got
rich
people
do
those
things
now
as
they
build
ruins
on
maiden
estates
and
cast
antiques
at
elfride
merely
listened
and
said
nothing
he
continued
more
quietly
and
impressively
yes
elfride
she
is
wealthy
in
comparison
with
us
though
with
few
connections
however
she
will
introduce
you
to
the
world
a
little
we
are
going
to
exchange
her
house
in
baker
street
for
one
at
kensington
for
your
sake
everybody
is
going
there
now
she
says
at
easters
we
shall
fly
to
town
for
the
usual
three
months
i
shall
have
a
curate
of
course
by
that
time
elfride
i
am
past
love
you
know
and
i
honestly
confess
that
i
married
her
for
your
sake
why
a
woman
of
her
standing
should
have
thrown
herself
away
upon
me
god
knows
but
i
suppose
her
age
and
plainness
were
too
pronounced
for
a
town
man
with
your
good
looks
if
you
now
play
your
cards
well
you
may
marry
anybody
of
course
a
little
contrivance
will
be
necessary
but
there
s
nothing
to
stand
between
you
and
a
husband
with
a
title
that
i
can
see
lady
luxellian
was
only
a
squire
s
daughter
now
don
t
you
see
how
foolish
the
old
fancy
was
but
come
she
is
indoors
waiting
to
see
you
it
is
as
good
as
a
play
too
continued
the
vicar
as
they
walked
towards
the
house
i
courted
her
through
the
privet
hedge
yonder
not
entirely
you
know
but
we
used
to
walk
there
of
an
evening
nearly
every
evening
at
last
but
i
needn
t
tell
you
details
now
everything
was
terribly
i
assure
you
at
last
that
day
i
saw
her
at
stratleigh
we
determined
to
settle
it
and
you
never
said
a
word
to
me
replied
elfride
not
reproachfully
either
in
tone
or
thought
indeed
her
feeling
was
the
very
reverse
of
reproachful
she
felt
relieved
and
even
thankful
where
confidence
had
not
been
given
how
could
confidence
be
expected
her
father
mistook
her
dispassionateness
for
a
veil
of
politeness
over
a
sense
of
i
am
not
altogether
to
blame
he
said
there
were
two
or
three
reasons
for
secrecy
one
was
the
recent
death
of
her
relative
the
testator
though
that
did
not
apply
to
you
but
remember
elfride
he
continued
in
a
stiffer
tone
you
had
mixed
yourself
up
so
foolishly
with
those
low
people
the
smiths
and
it
was
just
too
when
troyton
and
myself
were
beginning
to
understand
each
other
that
i
resolved
to
say
nothing
even
to
you
how
did
i
know
how
far
you
had
gone
with
them
and
their
son
you
might
have
made
a
point
of
taking
tea
with
them
every
day
for
all
that
i
elfride
swallowed
her
feelings
as
she
best
could
and
languidly
though
flatly
asked
a
question
did
you
kiss
troyton
on
the
lawn
about
three
weeks
ago
that
evening
i
came
into
the
study
and
found
you
had
just
had
candles
in
swancourt
looked
rather
red
and
abashed
as
lovers
are
apt
to
do
when
caught
in
the
tricks
of
younger
ones
well
yes
i
think
i
did
he
stammered
just
to
please
her
you
and
then
recovering
himself
he
laughed
heartily
and
was
this
what
your
horatian
quotation
referred
to
it
was
they
stepped
into
the
from
the
verandah
at
that
moment
swancourt
came
downstairs
and
entered
the
same
room
by
the
door
here
charlotte
is
my
little
elfride
said
swancourt
with
the
increased
affection
of
tone
often
adopted
towards
relations
when
newly
produced
poor
elfride
not
knowing
what
to
do
did
nothing
at
all
but
stood
receptive
of
all
that
came
to
her
by
sight
hearing
and
touch
swancourt
moved
forward
took
her
s
hand
then
kissed
her
ah
darling
she
exclaimed
you
didn
t
think
when
you
showed
a
strange
old
woman
over
the
conservatory
a
month
or
two
ago
and
explained
the
flowers
to
her
so
prettily
that
she
would
so
soon
be
here
in
new
colours
nor
did
she
i
am
the
new
mother
had
been
truthfully
enough
described
by
swancourt
she
was
not
physically
attractive
she
was
dark
very
dark
in
complexion
portly
in
figure
and
with
a
plentiful
residuum
of
hair
in
the
proportion
of
half
a
dozen
white
ones
to
half
a
dozen
black
ones
though
the
latter
were
black
indeed
no
further
observed
she
was
not
a
woman
to
like
but
there
was
more
to
see
to
the
most
superficial
critic
it
was
apparent
that
she
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
her
age
she
looked
sixty
at
the
first
glance
and
close
acquaintanceship
never
proved
her
older
another
and
still
more
winning
trait
was
one
attaching
to
the
corners
of
her
mouth
before
she
made
a
remark
these
often
twitched
gently
not
backwards
and
forwards
the
index
of
nervousness
not
down
upon
the
jaw
the
sign
of
determination
but
palpably
upwards
in
precisely
the
curve
adopted
to
represent
mirth
in
the
broad
caricatures
of
schoolboys
only
this
element
in
her
face
was
expressive
of
anything
within
the
woman
but
it
was
unmistakable
it
expressed
humour
subjective
as
well
as
objective
which
could
survey
the
peculiarities
of
self
in
as
whimsical
a
light
as
those
of
other
people
this
is
not
all
of
swancourt
she
had
held
out
to
elfride
hands
whose
fingers
were
literally
stiff
with
rings
signis
auroque
rigentes
like
helen
s
robe
these
rows
of
rings
were
not
worn
in
vanity
apparently
they
were
mostly
antique
and
dull
though
a
few
were
the
reverse
right
hand
plainly
set
oval
onyx
representing
a
devil
s
head
green
jasper
intaglio
with
red
veins
entirely
gold
bearing
figure
of
a
hideous
griffin
a
monster
diamond
with
small
diamonds
round
it
antique
cornelian
intaglio
of
dancing
figure
of
a
satyr
an
angular
band
chased
with
dragons
heads
a
facetted
carbuncle
accompanied
by
ten
little
twinkling
emeralds
left
hand
a
toadstone
a
heavy
ring
enamelled
in
colours
and
bearing
a
jacynth
an
amethystine
sapphire
a
polished
ruby
surrounded
by
diamonds
the
engraved
ring
of
an
abbess
a
gloomy
intaglio
beyond
this
rather
quaint
array
of
stone
and
metal
swancourt
wore
no
ornament
whatever
elfride
had
been
favourably
impressed
with
troyton
at
their
meeting
about
two
months
earlier
but
to
be
pleased
with
a
woman
as
a
momentary
acquaintance
was
different
from
being
taken
with
her
as
a
stepmother
however
the
suspension
of
feeling
was
but
for
a
moment
elfride
decided
to
like
her
still
swancourt
was
a
woman
of
the
world
as
to
knowledge
the
reverse
as
to
action
as
her
marriage
suggested
elfride
and
the
lady
were
soon
inextricably
involved
in
conversation
and
swancourt
left
them
to
themselves
and
what
do
you
find
to
do
with
yourself
here
swancourt
said
after
a
few
remarks
about
the
wedding
you
ride
i
yes
i
ride
but
not
much
because
papa
doesn
t
like
my
going
you
must
have
somebody
to
look
after
and
i
read
and
write
a
you
should
write
a
novel
the
regular
resource
of
people
who
don
t
go
enough
into
the
world
to
live
a
novel
is
to
write
i
have
done
it
said
elfride
looking
dubiously
at
swancourt
as
if
in
doubt
whether
she
would
meet
with
ridicule
there
that
s
right
now
then
what
is
it
about
dear
about
well
it
is
a
romance
of
the
middle
knowing
nothing
of
the
present
age
which
everybody
knows
about
for
safety
you
chose
an
age
known
neither
to
you
nor
other
people
that
s
it
eh
no
no
i
don
t
mean
it
well
i
have
had
some
opportunities
of
studying
mediaeval
art
and
manners
in
the
library
and
private
museum
at
endelstow
house
and
i
thought
i
should
like
to
try
my
hand
upon
a
fiction
i
know
the
time
for
these
tales
is
past
but
i
was
interested
in
it
very
much
when
is
it
to
appear
oh
never
i
nonsense
my
dear
girl
publish
it
by
all
means
all
ladies
do
that
sort
of
thing
now
not
for
profit
you
know
but
as
a
guarantee
of
mental
respectability
to
their
future
an
excellent
idea
of
us
though
i
am
afraid
it
rather
resembles
the
melancholy
ruse
of
throwing
loaves
over
at
besiegers
and
suggests
desperation
rather
than
plenty
did
you
ever
try
it
no
i
was
too
far
gone
even
for
papa
says
no
publisher
will
take
my
that
remains
to
be
proved
i
ll
give
my
word
my
dear
that
by
this
time
next
year
it
shall
be
will
you
indeed
said
elfride
partially
brightening
with
pleasure
though
she
was
sad
enough
in
her
depths
i
thought
brains
were
the
indispensable
even
if
the
only
qualification
for
admission
to
the
republic
of
letters
a
mere
commonplace
creature
like
me
will
soon
be
turned
out
oh
no
once
you
are
there
you
ll
be
like
a
drop
of
water
in
a
piece
of
your
medium
will
dignify
your
it
will
be
a
great
satisfaction
elfride
murmured
and
thought
of
stephen
and
wished
she
could
make
a
great
fortune
by
writing
romances
and
marry
him
and
live
happily
and
then
we
ll
go
to
london
and
then
to
paris
said
swancourt
i
have
been
talking
to
your
father
about
it
but
we
have
first
to
move
into
the
and
we
think
of
staying
at
torquay
whilst
that
is
going
on
meanwhile
instead
of
going
on
a
honeymoon
scamper
by
ourselves
we
have
come
home
to
fetch
you
and
go
all
together
to
bath
for
two
or
three
elfride
assented
pleasantly
even
gladly
but
she
saw
that
by
this
marriage
her
father
and
herself
had
ceased
for
ever
to
be
the
close
relations
they
had
been
up
to
a
few
weeks
ago
it
was
impossible
now
to
tell
him
the
tale
of
her
wild
elopement
with
stephen
smith
he
was
still
snugly
housed
in
her
heart
his
absence
had
regained
for
him
much
of
that
aureola
of
saintship
which
had
been
nearly
abstracted
during
her
reproachful
mood
on
that
miserable
journey
from
london
rapture
is
often
cooled
by
contact
with
its
cause
especially
if
under
awkward
conditions
and
that
last
experience
with
stephen
had
done
anything
but
make
him
shine
in
her
eyes
his
very
kindness
in
letting
her
return
was
his
offence
elfride
had
her
sex
s
love
of
sheer
force
in
a
man
however
and
at
that
critical
juncture
in
london
stephen
s
only
chance
of
retaining
the
ascendancy
over
her
that
his
face
and
not
his
parts
had
acquired
for
him
would
have
been
by
doing
what
for
one
thing
he
was
too
youthful
to
undertake
that
was
dragging
her
by
the
wrist
to
the
rails
of
some
altar
and
peremptorily
marrying
her
decisive
action
is
seen
by
appreciative
minds
to
be
frequently
objectless
and
sometimes
fatal
but
decision
however
suicidal
has
more
charm
for
a
woman
than
the
most
unequivocal
fabian
success
however
some
of
the
unpleasant
accessories
of
that
occasion
were
now
out
of
sight
again
and
stephen
had
resumed
not
a
few
of
his
fancy
colours
chapter
xiii
he
set
in
order
many
it
is
london
in
october
two
months
further
on
in
the
story
bede
s
inn
has
this
peculiarity
that
it
faces
receives
from
and
discharges
into
a
bustling
thoroughfare
speaking
only
of
wealth
and
respectability
whilst
its
postern
abuts
on
as
crowded
and
a
network
of
alleys
as
are
to
be
found
anywhere
in
the
metropolis
the
moral
consequences
are
first
that
those
who
occupy
chambers
in
the
inn
may
see
a
great
deal
of
shirtless
humanity
s
habits
and
enjoyments
without
doing
more
than
look
down
from
a
back
window
and
second
they
may
hear
wholesome
though
unpleasant
social
reminders
through
the
medium
of
a
harsh
voice
an
unequal
footstep
the
echo
of
a
blow
or
a
fall
which
originates
in
the
person
of
some
drunkard
or
as
he
crosses
and
interferes
with
the
quiet
of
the
square
characters
of
this
kind
frequently
pass
through
the
inn
from
a
little
foxhole
of
an
alley
at
the
back
but
they
never
loiter
there
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
state
that
all
the
sights
and
movements
proper
to
the
inn
are
most
orderly
on
the
fine
october
evening
on
which
we
follow
stephen
smith
to
this
place
a
placid
porter
is
sitting
on
a
stool
under
a
in
the
midst
with
a
little
cane
in
his
hand
we
notice
the
thick
coat
of
soot
upon
the
branches
hanging
underneath
them
in
flakes
as
in
a
chimney
the
blackness
of
these
boughs
does
not
at
present
improve
the
tree
nearly
forsaken
by
its
leaves
as
it
is
but
in
the
spring
their
green
fresh
beauty
is
made
doubly
beautiful
by
the
contrast
within
the
railings
is
a
of
respectable
dahlias
and
chrysanthemums
where
a
man
is
sweeping
the
leaves
from
the
grass
stephen
selects
a
doorway
and
ascends
an
old
though
wide
wooden
staircase
with
moulded
balusters
and
handrail
which
in
a
country
would
be
considered
a
noteworthy
specimen
of
renaissance
workmanship
he
reaches
a
door
on
the
first
floor
over
which
is
painted
in
black
letters
mr
henry
knight
being
understood
but
not
expressed
the
wall
is
thick
and
there
is
a
door
at
its
outer
and
inner
face
the
outer
one
happens
to
be
ajar
stephen
goes
to
the
other
and
taps
come
in
from
distant
penetralia
first
was
a
small
anteroom
divided
from
the
inner
apartment
by
a
wainscoted
archway
two
or
three
yards
wide
across
this
archway
hung
a
pair
of
curtains
making
a
mystery
of
all
within
the
arch
except
the
spasmodic
scratching
of
a
quill
pen
here
was
grouped
a
chaotic
assemblage
of
articles
mainly
old
framed
prints
and
paintings
leaning
edgewise
against
the
wall
like
roofing
slates
in
a
builder
s
yard
all
the
books
visible
here
were
folios
too
big
to
be
stolen
some
lying
on
a
heavy
oak
table
in
one
corner
some
on
the
floor
among
the
pictures
the
whole
intermingled
with
old
coats
hats
umbrellas
and
stephen
pushed
aside
the
curtain
and
before
him
sat
a
man
writing
away
as
if
his
life
depended
upon
it
which
it
did
a
man
of
thirty
in
a
speckled
coat
with
dark
brown
hair
curly
beard
and
crisp
moustache
the
latter
running
into
the
beard
on
each
side
of
the
mouth
and
as
usual
hiding
the
real
expression
of
that
organ
under
a
chronic
aspect
of
impassivity
ah
my
dear
fellow
i
knew
twas
you
said
knight
looking
up
with
a
smile
and
holding
out
his
hand
knight
s
mouth
and
eyes
came
to
view
now
both
features
were
good
and
had
the
peculiarity
of
appearing
younger
and
fresher
than
the
brow
and
face
they
belonged
to
which
were
getting
sicklied
o
er
by
the
unmistakable
pale
cast
the
mouth
had
not
quite
relinquished
rotundity
of
curve
for
the
firm
angularities
of
middle
life
and
the
eyes
though
keen
permeated
rather
than
penetrated
what
they
had
lost
of
their
brightness
by
a
dozen
years
of
hard
reading
lending
a
quietness
to
their
gaze
which
suited
them
well
a
lady
would
have
said
there
was
a
smell
of
tobacco
in
the
room
a
man
that
there
was
not
knight
did
not
rise
he
looked
at
a
timepiece
on
the
mantelshelf
then
turned
again
to
his
letters
pointing
to
a
chair
well
i
am
glad
you
have
come
i
only
returned
to
town
yesterday
now
don
t
speak
stephen
for
ten
minutes
i
have
just
that
time
to
the
late
post
at
the
eleventh
minute
i
m
your
stephen
sat
down
as
if
this
kind
of
reception
was
by
no
means
new
and
away
went
knight
s
pen
beating
up
and
down
like
a
ship
in
a
storm
cicero
called
the
library
the
soul
of
the
house
here
the
house
was
all
soul
portions
of
the
floor
and
half
the
were
taken
up
by
ordinary
and
extraordinary
the
remaining
parts
together
with
brackets
being
occupied
by
casts
statuettes
medallions
and
plaques
of
various
descriptions
picked
up
by
the
owner
in
his
wanderings
through
france
and
italy
one
stream
only
of
evening
sunlight
came
into
the
room
from
a
window
quite
in
the
corner
overlooking
a
court
an
aquarium
stood
in
the
window
it
was
a
dull
parallelopipedon
enough
for
living
creatures
at
most
hours
of
the
day
but
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
evening
as
now
an
errant
kindly
ray
lighted
up
and
warmed
the
little
world
therein
when
the
zoophytes
opened
and
put
forth
their
arms
the
weeds
acquired
a
rich
transparency
the
shells
gleamed
of
a
more
golden
yellow
and
the
timid
community
expressed
gladness
more
plainly
than
in
words
within
the
prescribed
ten
minutes
knight
flung
down
his
pen
rang
for
the
boy
to
take
the
letters
to
the
post
and
at
the
closing
of
the
door
exclaimed
there
thank
god
that
s
done
now
stephen
pull
your
chair
round
and
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
all
this
time
have
you
kept
up
your
greek
how
s
that
i
haven
t
enough
spare
that
s
well
i
have
done
a
great
many
things
if
not
that
and
i
have
done
one
extraordinary
knight
turned
full
upon
stephen
now
then
let
me
look
into
your
face
put
two
and
two
together
and
make
a
shrewd
stephen
changed
to
a
redder
colour
why
smith
said
knight
after
holding
him
rigidly
by
the
shoulders
and
keenly
scrutinising
his
countenance
for
a
minute
in
silence
you
have
fallen
in
well
the
fact
is
now
out
with
but
seeing
that
stephen
looked
rather
distressed
he
changed
to
a
kindly
tone
now
smith
my
lad
you
know
me
well
enough
by
this
time
or
you
ought
to
and
you
know
very
well
that
if
you
choose
to
give
me
a
detailed
account
of
the
phenomenon
within
you
i
shall
listen
if
you
don
t
i
am
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
care
to
hear
i
ll
tell
this
much
i
have
fallen
in
love
and
i
want
to
be
knight
looked
ominous
as
this
passed
stephen
s
lips
don
t
judge
me
before
you
have
heard
more
cried
stephen
anxiously
seeing
the
change
in
his
friend
s
countenance
i
don
t
judge
does
your
mother
know
about
it
nothing
father
no
but
i
ll
tell
you
the
young
person
come
that
s
dreadfully
ungallant
but
perhaps
i
understand
the
frame
of
mind
a
little
so
go
on
your
sweetheart
she
is
rather
higher
in
the
world
than
i
as
it
should
and
her
father
won
t
hear
of
it
as
i
now
not
an
uncommon
and
now
comes
what
i
want
your
advice
upon
something
has
happened
at
her
house
which
makes
it
out
of
the
question
for
us
to
ask
her
father
again
now
so
we
are
keeping
silent
in
the
meantime
an
architect
in
india
has
just
written
to
hewby
to
ask
whether
he
can
find
for
him
a
young
assistant
willing
to
go
over
to
bombay
to
prepare
drawings
for
work
formerly
done
by
the
engineers
the
salary
he
offers
is
rupees
a
month
or
about
pounds
hewby
has
mentioned
it
to
me
and
i
have
been
to
wray
who
says
i
shall
acclimatise
without
much
illness
now
would
you
go
you
mean
to
say
because
it
is
a
possible
road
to
the
young
yes
i
was
thinking
i
could
go
over
and
make
a
little
money
and
then
come
back
and
ask
for
her
i
have
the
option
of
practising
for
myself
after
a
would
she
be
staunch
oh
yes
for
ever
to
the
end
of
her
life
how
do
you
know
why
how
do
people
know
of
course
she
knight
leant
back
in
his
chair
now
though
i
know
her
thoroughly
as
she
exists
in
your
heart
stephen
i
don
t
know
her
in
the
flesh
all
i
want
to
ask
is
is
this
idea
of
going
to
india
based
entirely
upon
a
belief
in
her
fidelity
yes
i
should
not
go
if
it
were
not
for
well
stephen
you
have
put
me
in
rather
an
awkward
position
if
i
give
my
true
sentiments
i
shall
hurt
your
feelings
if
i
don
t
i
shall
hurt
my
own
judgment
and
remember
i
don
t
know
much
about
but
you
have
had
attachments
although
you
tell
me
very
little
about
and
i
only
hope
you
ll
continue
to
prosper
till
i
tell
you
stephen
winced
at
this
rap
i
have
never
formed
a
deep
attachment
continued
knight
i
never
have
found
a
woman
worth
it
nor
have
i
been
once
engaged
to
be
you
write
as
if
you
had
been
engaged
a
hundred
times
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
said
stephen
in
an
injured
tone
yes
that
may
be
but
my
dear
stephen
it
is
only
those
who
half
know
a
thing
that
write
about
it
those
who
know
it
thoroughly
don
t
take
the
trouble
all
i
know
about
women
or
men
either
is
a
mass
of
generalities
i
plod
along
and
occasionally
lift
my
eyes
and
skim
the
weltering
surface
of
mankind
lying
between
me
and
the
horizon
as
a
crow
might
no
knight
stopped
as
if
he
had
fallen
into
a
train
of
thought
and
stephen
looked
with
affectionate
awe
at
a
master
whose
mind
he
believed
could
swallow
up
at
one
meal
all
that
his
own
head
contained
there
was
affective
sympathy
but
no
great
intellectual
fellowship
between
knight
and
stephen
smith
knight
had
seen
his
young
friend
when
the
latter
was
a
happy
boy
had
been
interested
in
him
had
kept
his
eye
upon
him
and
generously
helped
the
lad
to
books
till
the
mere
connection
of
patronage
grew
to
acquaintance
and
that
ripened
to
friendship
and
so
though
smith
was
not
at
all
the
man
knight
would
have
deliberately
chosen
as
a
friend
or
even
for
one
of
a
group
of
a
dozen
friends
he
somehow
was
his
friend
circumstance
as
usual
did
it
all
how
many
of
us
can
say
of
our
most
intimate
alter
ego
leaving
alone
friends
of
the
outer
circle
that
he
is
the
man
we
should
have
chosen
as
embodying
the
net
result
after
adding
up
all
the
points
in
human
nature
that
we
love
and
principles
we
hold
and
subtracting
all
that
we
hate
the
man
is
really
somebody
we
got
to
know
by
mere
physical
juxtaposition
long
maintained
and
was
taken
into
our
confidence
and
even
heart
as
a
makeshift
and
what
do
you
think
of
her
stephen
ventured
to
say
after
a
silence
taking
her
merits
on
trust
from
you
said
knight
as
we
do
those
of
the
roman
poets
of
whom
we
know
nothing
but
that
they
lived
i
still
think
she
will
not
stick
to
you
through
say
three
years
of
absence
in
but
she
will
cried
stephen
desperately
she
is
a
girl
all
delicacy
and
honour
and
no
woman
of
that
kind
who
has
committed
herself
so
into
a
man
s
hands
as
she
has
into
mine
could
possibly
marry
how
has
she
committed
herself
asked
knight
cunously
stephen
did
not
answer
knight
had
looked
on
his
love
so
sceptically
that
it
would
not
do
to
say
all
that
he
had
intended
to
say
by
any
means
well
don
t
tell
said
knight
but
you
are
begging
the
question
which
is
i
suppose
inevitable
in
and
i
ll
tell
you
another
thing
the
younger
man
pleaded
you
remember
what
you
said
to
me
once
about
women
receiving
a
kiss
don
t
you
why
that
instead
of
our
being
charmed
by
the
fascination
of
their
bearing
at
such
a
time
we
should
immediately
doubt
them
if
their
confusion
has
any
grace
in
it
that
awkward
bungling
was
the
true
charm
of
the
occasion
implying
that
we
are
the
first
who
has
played
such
a
part
with
it
is
true
quite
said
knight
musingly
it
often
happened
that
the
disciple
thus
remembered
the
lessons
of
the
master
long
after
the
master
himself
had
forgotten
them
well
that
was
like
her
cried
stephen
triumphantly
she
was
in
such
a
flurry
that
she
didn
t
know
what
she
was
splendid
splendid
said
knight
soothingly
so
that
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
if
you
see
a
good
opening
in
bombay
there
s
no
reason
why
you
should
not
go
without
troubling
to
draw
fine
distinctions
as
to
reasons
no
man
fully
realizes
what
opinions
he
acts
upon
or
what
his
actions
yes
i
go
to
bombay
i
ll
write
a
note
here
if
you
don
t
sleep
over
it
it
is
the
best
plan
and
write
meantime
go
there
to
that
window
and
sit
down
and
look
at
my
humanity
show
i
am
going
to
dine
out
this
evening
and
have
to
dress
here
out
of
my
portmanteau
i
bring
up
my
things
like
this
to
save
the
trouble
of
going
down
to
my
place
at
richmond
and
back
knight
then
went
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
flung
open
his
portmanteau
and
stephen
drew
near
the
window
the
streak
of
sunlight
had
crept
upward
edged
away
and
vanished
the
zoophytes
slept
a
dusky
gloom
pervaded
the
room
and
now
another
volume
of
light
shone
over
the
window
there
said
knight
where
is
there
in
england
a
spectacle
to
equal
that
i
sit
there
and
watch
them
every
night
before
i
go
home
softly
open
the
beneath
them
was
an
alley
running
up
to
the
wall
and
thence
turning
sideways
and
passing
under
an
arch
so
that
knight
s
back
window
was
immediately
over
the
angle
and
commanded
a
view
of
the
alley
lengthwise
crowds
mostly
of
women
were
surging
bustling
and
pacing
up
and
down
gaslights
glared
from
butchers
stalls
illuminating
the
lumps
of
flesh
to
splotches
of
orange
and
vermilion
like
the
wild
colouring
of
turner
s
later
pictures
whilst
the
purl
and
babble
of
tongues
of
every
pitch
and
mood
was
to
this
human
what
the
ripple
of
a
brook
is
to
the
natural
forest
nearly
ten
minutes
passed
then
knight
also
came
to
the
window
well
now
i
call
a
cab
and
vanish
down
the
street
in
the
direction
of
berkeley
square
he
said
buttoning
his
waistcoat
and
kicking
his
morning
suit
into
a
corner
stephen
rose
to
leave
what
a
heap
of
literature
remarked
the
young
man
taking
a
final
longing
survey
round
the
room
as
if
to
abide
there
for
ever
would
be
the
great
pleasure
of
his
life
yet
feeling
that
he
had
almost
outstayed
his
his
eyes
rested
upon
an
piled
full
of
newspapers
magazines
and
bright
new
volumes
in
green
and
red
yes
said
knight
also
looking
at
them
and
breathing
a
sigh
of
weariness
something
must
be
done
with
several
of
them
soon
i
suppose
stephen
you
needn
t
hurry
away
for
a
few
minutes
you
know
if
you
want
to
stay
i
am
not
quite
ready
overhaul
those
volumes
whilst
i
put
on
my
coat
and
i
ll
walk
a
little
way
with
stephen
sat
down
beside
the
and
began
to
tumble
the
books
about
among
the
rest
he
found
a
novelette
in
one
volume
the
court
of
kellyon
castle
by
ernest
field
are
you
going
to
review
this
inquired
stephen
with
apparent
unconcern
and
holding
up
elfride
s
effusion
which
oh
that
i
may
though
i
don
t
do
much
light
reviewing
now
but
it
is
how
do
you
mean
knight
never
liked
to
be
asked
what
he
meant
mean
i
mean
that
the
majority
of
books
published
are
neither
good
enough
nor
bad
enough
to
provoke
criticism
and
that
that
book
does
provoke
by
its
goodness
or
its
badness
stephen
said
with
some
anxiety
on
poor
little
elfride
s
score
its
badness
it
seems
to
be
written
by
some
girl
in
her
stephen
said
not
another
word
he
did
not
care
to
speak
plainly
of
elfride
after
that
unfortunate
slip
his
tongue
had
made
in
respect
of
her
having
committed
herself
and
apart
from
that
knight
s
severe
almost
dogged
and
honesty
in
criticizing
was
unassailable
by
the
humble
wish
of
a
youthful
friend
like
stephen
knight
was
now
ready
turning
off
the
gas
and
slamming
together
the
door
they
went
downstairs
and
into
the
street
chapter
xiv
we
frolic
while
tis
it
has
now
to
be
realized
that
nearly
of
a
year
have
passed
away
in
place
of
the
autumnal
scenery
which
formed
a
setting
to
the
previous
enactments
we
have
the
culminating
blooms
of
summer
in
the
year
following
stephen
is
in
india
slaving
away
at
an
office
in
bombay
occasionally
going
up
the
country
on
professional
errands
and
wondering
why
people
who
had
been
there
longer
than
he
complained
so
much
of
the
effect
of
the
climate
upon
their
constitutions
never
had
a
young
man
a
finer
start
than
seemed
now
to
present
itself
to
stephen
it
was
just
in
that
exceptional
heyday
of
prosperity
which
shone
over
bombay
some
few
years
ago
that
he
arrived
on
the
scene
building
and
engineering
partook
of
the
general
impetus
speculation
moved
with
an
accelerated
velocity
every
successive
day
the
only
disagreeable
contingency
connected
with
it
being
the
possibility
of
a
collapse
elfride
had
never
told
her
father
of
the
escapade
with
stephen
nor
had
it
to
her
knowledge
come
to
his
ears
by
any
other
route
it
was
a
secret
trouble
and
grief
to
the
girl
for
a
short
time
and
stephen
s
departure
was
another
ingredient
in
her
sorrow
but
elfride
possessed
special
facilities
for
getting
rid
of
trouble
after
a
decent
interval
whilst
a
slow
nature
was
imbibing
a
misfortune
little
by
little
she
had
swallowed
the
whole
agony
of
it
at
a
draught
and
was
brightening
again
she
could
slough
off
a
sadness
and
replace
it
by
a
hope
as
easily
as
a
lizard
renews
a
diseased
limb
and
two
such
excellent
distractions
had
presented
themselves
one
was
bringing
out
the
romance
and
looking
for
notices
in
the
papers
which
though
they
had
been
significantly
short
so
far
had
served
to
divert
her
thoughts
the
other
was
migrating
from
the
vicarage
to
the
more
commodious
old
house
of
swancourt
s
overlooking
the
same
valley
swancourt
at
first
disliked
the
idea
of
being
transplanted
to
feminine
soil
but
the
obvious
advantages
of
such
an
accession
of
dignity
reconciled
him
to
the
change
so
there
was
a
radical
move
the
two
ladies
staying
at
torquay
as
had
been
arranged
the
vicar
going
to
and
fro
swancourt
considerably
enlarged
elfride
s
ideas
in
an
aristocratic
direction
and
she
began
to
forgive
her
father
for
his
politic
marriage
certainly
in
a
worldly
sense
a
handsome
face
at
had
never
served
a
man
in
better
stead
the
new
house
at
kensington
was
ready
and
they
were
all
in
town
the
hyde
park
shrubs
had
been
transplanted
as
usual
the
chairs
ranked
in
line
the
grass
edgings
trimmed
the
roads
made
to
look
as
if
they
were
suffering
from
a
heavy
thunderstorm
carriages
had
been
called
for
by
the
easeful
horses
by
the
brisk
and
the
drive
and
row
were
again
the
groove
of
gaiety
for
an
hour
we
gaze
upon
the
spectacle
at
six
o
clock
on
this
midsummer
afternoon
in
a
atmosphere
and
beneath
a
violet
sky
the
swancourt
equipage
formed
one
in
the
stream
swancourt
was
a
talker
of
talk
of
the
incisive
kind
which
her
low
musical
voice
the
only
beautiful
point
in
the
old
woman
prevented
from
being
wearisome
now
she
said
to
elfride
who
like
aeneas
at
carthage
was
full
of
admiration
for
the
brilliant
scene
you
will
find
that
our
companionless
state
will
give
us
as
it
does
everybody
an
extraordinary
power
in
reading
the
features
of
our
here
i
always
am
a
listener
in
such
places
as
these
not
to
the
narratives
told
by
my
neighbours
tongues
but
by
their
faces
the
advantage
of
which
is
that
whether
i
am
in
row
boulevard
rialto
or
prado
they
all
speak
the
same
language
i
may
have
acquired
some
skill
in
this
practice
through
having
been
an
ugly
lonely
woman
for
so
many
years
with
nobody
to
give
me
information
a
thing
you
will
not
consider
strange
when
the
parallel
case
is
borne
in
mind
how
truly
people
who
have
no
clocks
will
tell
the
time
of
ay
that
they
will
said
swancourt
corroboratively
i
have
known
labouring
men
at
endelstow
and
other
farms
who
had
framed
complete
systems
of
observation
for
that
purpose
by
means
of
shadows
winds
clouds
the
movements
of
sheep
and
oxen
the
singing
of
birds
the
crowing
of
cocks
and
a
hundred
other
sights
and
sounds
which
people
with
watches
in
their
pockets
never
know
the
existence
of
they
are
able
to
pronounce
within
ten
minutes
of
the
hour
almost
at
any
required
instant
that
reminds
me
of
an
old
story
which
i
m
afraid
is
too
bad
too
bad
to
here
the
vicar
shook
his
head
and
laughed
inwardly
tell
it
do
said
the
ladies
i
mustn
t
quite
tell
that
s
absurd
said
swancourt
it
was
only
about
a
man
who
by
the
same
careful
system
of
observation
was
known
to
deceive
persons
for
more
than
two
years
into
the
belief
that
he
kept
a
barometer
by
stealth
so
exactly
did
he
foretell
all
changes
in
the
weather
by
the
braying
of
his
ass
and
the
temper
of
his
elfride
laughed
exactly
said
swancourt
and
in
just
the
way
that
those
learnt
the
signs
of
nature
i
have
learnt
the
language
of
her
illegitimate
sister
artificiality
and
the
fibbing
of
eyes
the
contempt
of
the
indignation
of
back
hair
the
laughter
of
clothes
the
cynicism
of
footsteps
and
the
various
emotions
lying
in
twirls
the
elevation
of
parasols
the
carriage
of
umbrellas
become
as
a
b
c
to
me
just
look
at
that
daughter
s
sister
class
of
mamma
in
the
carriage
across
there
she
continued
to
elfride
pointing
with
merely
a
turn
of
her
eye
the
absorbing
of
her
position
that
is
shown
by
her
countenance
is
most
humiliating
to
a
lover
of
one
s
country
you
would
hardly
believe
would
you
that
members
of
a
fashionable
world
whose
professed
zero
is
far
above
the
highest
degree
of
the
humble
could
be
so
ignorant
of
the
elementary
instincts
of
how
why
to
bear
on
their
faces
as
plainly
as
on
a
phylactery
the
inscription
do
pray
look
at
the
coronet
on
my
really
charlotte
said
the
vicar
you
see
as
much
in
faces
as
mr
puff
saw
in
lord
burleigh
s
elfride
could
not
but
admire
the
beauty
of
her
fellow
countrywomen
especially
since
herself
and
her
own
few
acquaintances
had
always
been
slightly
sunburnt
or
marked
on
the
back
of
the
hands
by
a
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
what
lovely
flowers
and
leaves
they
wear
in
their
bonnets
she
exclaimed
oh
yes
returned
swancourt
some
of
them
are
even
more
striking
in
colour
than
any
real
ones
look
at
that
beautiful
rose
worn
by
the
lady
inside
the
rails
elegant
introduced
upon
the
stem
as
an
improvement
upon
prickles
and
all
growing
so
naturally
just
over
her
ear
i
say
growing
advisedly
for
the
pink
of
the
petals
and
the
pink
of
her
handsome
cheeks
are
equally
from
nature
s
hand
to
the
eyes
of
the
most
casual
but
praise
them
a
little
they
do
deserve
it
said
generous
elfride
well
i
do
see
how
the
duchess
of
waves
to
and
fro
in
her
seat
utilizing
the
sway
of
her
landau
by
looking
around
only
when
her
head
is
swung
forward
with
a
passive
pride
which
forbids
a
resistance
to
the
force
of
circumstance
look
at
the
pretty
pout
on
the
mouths
of
that
family
there
retaining
no
traces
of
being
arranged
beforehand
so
well
is
it
done
look
at
the
demure
close
of
the
little
fists
holding
the
parasols
the
tiny
alert
thumb
sticking
up
erect
against
the
ivory
stem
as
knowing
as
can
be
the
satin
of
the
parasol
invariably
matching
the
complexion
of
the
face
beneath
it
yet
seemingly
by
an
accident
which
makes
the
thing
so
attractive
there
s
the
red
book
lying
on
the
opposite
seat
bespeaking
the
vast
numbers
of
their
acquaintance
and
i
particularly
admire
the
aspect
of
that
abundantly
daughtered
woman
on
the
other
side
i
mean
her
look
of
unconsciousness
that
the
girls
are
stared
at
by
the
walkers
and
above
all
the
look
of
the
girls
themselves
losing
their
gaze
in
the
depths
of
handsome
men
s
eyes
without
appearing
to
notice
whether
they
are
observing
masculine
eyes
or
the
leaves
of
the
trees
there
s
praise
for
you
but
i
am
only
jesting
child
you
know
how
warm
it
is
to
be
sure
said
swancourt
as
if
his
mind
were
a
long
distance
from
all
he
saw
i
declare
that
my
watch
is
so
hot
that
i
can
scarcely
bear
to
touch
it
to
see
what
the
time
is
and
all
the
world
smells
like
the
inside
of
a
how
the
men
stare
at
you
elfride
said
the
elder
lady
you
will
kill
me
quite
i
am
kill
you
as
a
diamond
kills
an
opal
in
the
same
i
have
noticed
several
ladies
and
gentlemen
looking
at
me
said
elfride
artlessly
showing
her
pleasure
at
being
observed
my
dear
you
mustn
t
say
gentlemen
nowadays
her
stepmother
answered
in
the
tones
of
arch
concern
that
so
well
became
her
ugliness
we
have
handed
over
gentlemen
to
the
lower
middle
class
where
the
word
is
still
to
be
heard
at
tradesmen
s
balls
and
provincial
i
believe
it
is
done
with
what
must
i
say
then
ladies
and
men
at
this
moment
appeared
in
the
stream
of
vehicles
moving
in
the
contrary
direction
a
chariot
presenting
in
its
general
surface
the
rich
indigo
hue
of
a
midnight
sky
the
wheels
and
margins
being
picked
out
in
delicate
lines
of
ultramarine
the
servants
liveries
were
coats
and
silver
lace
and
breeches
of
neutral
indian
red
the
whole
concern
formed
an
organic
whole
and
moved
along
behind
a
pair
of
dark
chestnut
geldings
who
advanced
in
an
indifferently
zealous
trot
very
daintily
performed
and
occasionally
shrugged
divers
points
of
their
veiny
surface
as
if
they
were
rather
above
the
business
in
this
sat
a
gentleman
with
no
decided
characteristics
more
than
that
he
somewhat
resembled
a
commercial
traveller
of
the
superior
class
beside
him
was
a
lady
with
eyes
and
complexion
belonging
to
the
interesting
class
of
women
where
that
class
merges
in
the
sickly
her
greatest
pleasure
being
apparently
to
enjoy
nothing
opposite
this
pair
sat
two
little
girls
in
white
hats
and
blue
feathers
the
lady
saw
elfride
smiled
and
bowed
and
touched
her
husband
s
elbow
who
turned
and
received
elfride
s
movement
of
recognition
with
a
gallant
elevation
of
his
hat
then
the
two
children
held
up
their
arms
to
elfride
and
laughed
gleefully
who
is
that
why
lord
luxellian
isn
t
it
said
swancourt
who
with
the
vicar
had
been
seated
with
her
back
towards
them
yes
replied
elfride
he
is
the
one
man
of
those
i
have
seen
here
whom
i
consider
handsomer
than
thank
you
dear
said
swancourt
yes
but
your
father
is
so
much
older
when
lord
luxellian
gets
a
little
further
on
in
life
he
won
t
be
half
so
as
our
thank
you
dear
likewise
said
swancourt
see
exclaimed
elfride
still
looking
towards
them
how
those
little
dears
want
me
actually
one
of
them
is
crying
for
me
to
we
were
talking
of
bracelets
just
now
look
at
lady
luxellian
s
said
swancourt
as
that
baroness
lifted
up
her
arm
to
support
one
of
the
children
it
is
slipping
up
her
arm
too
large
by
half
i
hate
to
see
daylight
between
a
bracelet
and
a
wrist
i
wonder
women
haven
t
better
it
is
not
on
that
account
indeed
elfride
expostulated
it
is
that
her
arm
has
got
thin
poor
thing
you
can
not
think
how
much
she
has
altered
in
this
last
the
carriages
were
now
nearer
together
and
there
was
an
exchange
of
more
familiar
greetings
between
the
two
families
then
the
luxellians
crossed
over
and
drew
up
under
the
just
in
the
rear
of
the
swancourts
lord
luxellian
alighted
and
came
forward
with
a
musical
laugh
it
was
his
attraction
as
a
man
people
liked
him
for
those
tones
and
forgot
that
he
had
no
talents
acquaintances
remembered
swancourt
by
his
manner
they
remembered
stephen
smith
by
his
face
lord
luxellian
by
his
laugh
swancourt
made
some
friendly
remarks
among
others
things
upon
the
heat
yes
said
lord
luxellian
we
were
driving
by
a
furrier
s
window
this
afternoon
and
the
sight
filled
us
all
with
such
a
sense
of
suffocation
that
we
were
glad
to
get
away
he
turned
to
elfride
miss
swancourt
i
have
hardly
seen
or
spoken
to
you
since
your
literary
feat
was
made
public
i
had
no
idea
a
chiel
was
taking
notes
down
at
quiet
endelstow
or
i
should
certainly
have
put
myself
and
friends
upon
our
best
behaviour
swancourt
why
didn
t
you
give
me
a
hint
elfride
fluttered
blushed
laughed
said
it
was
nothing
to
speak
of
well
i
think
you
were
rather
unfairly
treated
by
the
present
i
certainly
do
writing
a
heavy
review
like
that
upon
an
elegant
trifle
like
the
court
of
kellyon
castle
was
what
said
elfride
opening
her
eyes
was
i
reviewed
in
the
present
oh
yes
didn
t
you
see
it
why
it
was
four
or
five
months
ago
no
i
never
saw
it
how
sorry
i
am
what
a
shame
of
my
publishers
they
promised
to
send
me
every
notice
that
ah
then
i
am
almost
afraid
i
have
been
giving
you
disagreeable
information
intentionally
withheld
out
of
courtesy
depend
upon
it
they
thought
no
good
would
come
of
sending
it
and
so
would
not
pain
you
oh
no
i
am
indeed
glad
you
have
told
me
lord
luxellian
it
is
quite
a
mistaken
kindness
on
their
part
is
the
review
so
much
against
me
she
inquired
tremulously
no
no
not
that
exactly
though
i
almost
forget
its
exact
purport
now
it
was
merely
merely
sharp
you
know
ungenerous
i
might
say
but
really
my
memory
does
not
enable
me
to
speak
we
ll
drive
to
the
present
office
and
get
one
directly
shall
we
papa
if
you
are
so
anxious
dear
we
will
or
send
but
will
and
do
oblige
me
in
a
little
matter
now
elfride
said
lord
luxellian
warmly
and
looking
as
if
he
were
sorry
he
had
brought
news
that
disturbed
her
i
am
in
reality
sent
here
as
a
special
messenger
by
my
little
polly
and
katie
to
ask
you
to
come
into
our
carriage
with
them
for
a
short
time
i
am
just
going
to
walk
across
into
piccadilly
and
my
wife
is
left
alone
with
them
i
am
afraid
they
are
rather
spoilt
children
but
i
have
half
promised
them
you
shall
the
steps
were
let
down
and
elfride
was
transferred
to
the
intense
delight
of
the
little
girls
and
to
the
mild
interest
of
loungers
with
red
skins
and
long
necks
who
cursorily
eyed
the
performance
with
their
to
their
lips
occasionally
laughing
from
far
down
their
throats
and
with
their
eyes
their
mouths
not
being
concerned
in
the
operation
at
all
lord
luxellian
then
told
the
coachman
to
drive
on
lifted
his
hat
smiled
a
smile
that
missed
its
mark
and
alighted
on
a
total
stranger
who
bowed
in
bewilderment
lord
luxellian
looked
long
at
elfride
the
look
was
a
manly
open
and
genuine
look
of
admiration
a
momentary
tribute
of
a
kind
which
any
honest
englishman
might
have
paid
to
fairness
without
being
ashamed
of
the
feeling
or
permitting
it
to
encroach
in
the
slightest
degree
upon
his
emotional
obligations
as
a
husband
and
head
of
a
family
then
lord
luxellian
turned
away
and
walked
musingly
to
the
upper
end
of
the
promenade
swancourt
had
alighted
at
the
same
time
with
elfride
crossing
over
to
the
row
for
a
few
minutes
to
speak
to
a
friend
he
recognized
there
and
his
wife
was
thus
left
sole
tenant
of
the
carriage
now
whilst
this
little
act
had
been
in
course
of
performance
there
stood
among
the
promenading
spectators
a
man
of
somewhat
different
description
from
the
rest
behind
the
general
throng
in
the
rear
of
the
chairs
and
leaning
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
he
looked
at
elfride
with
quiet
and
critical
interest
three
points
about
this
unobtrusive
person
showed
promptly
to
the
exercised
eye
that
he
was
not
a
row
man
pur
sang
first
an
irrepressible
wrinkle
or
two
in
the
waist
of
his
denoting
that
he
had
not
damned
his
tailor
sufficiently
to
drive
that
tradesman
up
to
the
orthodox
high
pressure
of
cunning
workmanship
second
a
slight
slovenliness
of
umbrella
occasioned
by
its
owner
s
habit
of
resting
heavily
upon
it
and
using
it
as
a
veritable
instead
of
letting
its
point
touch
the
ground
in
the
most
coquettish
of
kisses
as
is
the
proper
row
manner
to
do
third
and
chief
reason
that
try
how
you
might
you
could
scarcely
help
supposing
on
looking
at
his
face
that
your
eyes
were
not
far
from
a
mind
instead
of
the
skin
et
praeterea
nihil
which
is
by
rights
the
mark
of
the
row
the
probability
is
that
had
not
swancourt
been
left
alone
in
her
carriage
under
the
tree
this
man
would
have
remained
in
his
unobserved
seclusion
but
seeing
her
thus
he
came
round
to
the
front
stooped
under
the
rail
and
stood
beside
the
swancourt
looked
reflectively
at
him
for
a
quarter
of
a
minute
then
held
out
her
hand
laughingly
why
henry
knight
of
course
it
is
my
second
third
fourth
cousin
what
shall
i
say
at
any
rate
my
yes
one
of
a
remnant
not
yet
cut
off
i
scarcely
was
certain
of
you
either
from
where
i
was
i
have
not
seen
you
since
you
first
went
to
oxford
consider
the
number
of
years
you
know
i
suppose
of
my
marriage
and
there
sprang
up
a
dialogue
concerning
family
matters
of
birth
death
and
marriage
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
detail
knight
presently
inquired
the
young
lady
who
changed
into
the
other
carriage
is
then
your
stepdaughter
yes
elfride
you
must
know
and
who
was
the
lady
in
the
carriage
elfride
entered
who
had
an
and
watery
look
as
if
she
were
only
the

chapter
xv
a
wandering
though
sheer
and
intelligible
griefs
are
not
charmed
away
by
being
confided
to
mere
acquaintances
the
process
is
a
palliative
to
certain
among
these
perplexed
vexation
is
one
a
species
of
trouble
which
like
a
stream
gets
shallower
by
the
simple
operation
of
widening
it
in
any
quarter
on
the
evening
of
the
day
succeeding
that
of
the
meeting
in
the
park
elfride
and
swancourt
were
engaged
in
conversation
in
the
of
the
latter
such
a
treatment
of
such
a
case
was
in
course
of
adoption
here
elfride
had
just
before
received
an
affectionate
letter
from
stephen
smith
in
bombay
which
had
been
forwarded
to
her
from
endelstow
but
since
this
is
not
the
case
referred
to
it
is
not
worth
while
to
pry
further
into
the
contents
of
the
letter
than
to
discover
that
with
rash
though
pardonable
confidence
in
coming
times
he
addressed
her
in
high
spirits
as
his
darling
future
wife
probably
there
can
not
be
instanced
a
briefer
and
surer
test
of
a
man
s
temperament
sanguine
or
cautious
than
this
did
he
or
does
he
the
word
wife
in
corresponding
with
a
he
honestly
loves
she
had
taken
this
epistle
into
her
own
room
read
a
little
of
it
then
saved
the
rest
for
not
wishing
to
be
so
extravagant
as
to
consume
the
pleasure
all
at
once
nevertheless
she
could
not
resist
the
wish
to
enjoy
yet
a
little
more
so
out
came
the
letter
again
and
in
spite
of
misgivings
as
to
prodigality
the
whole
was
devoured
the
letter
was
finally
reperused
and
placed
in
her
pocket
what
was
this
also
a
newspaper
for
elfride
which
she
had
overlooked
in
her
hurry
to
open
the
letter
it
was
the
old
number
of
the
present
containing
the
article
upon
her
book
forwarded
as
had
been
requested
elfride
had
hastily
read
it
through
shrunk
perceptibly
smaller
and
had
then
gone
with
the
paper
in
her
hand
to
swancourt
s
to
lighten
or
at
least
modify
her
vexation
by
a
discriminating
estimate
from
her
stepmother
she
was
now
looking
disconsolately
out
of
the
window
never
mind
my
child
said
swancourt
after
a
careful
perusal
of
the
matter
indicated
i
don
t
see
that
the
review
is
such
a
terrible
one
after
all
besides
everybody
has
forgotten
about
it
by
this
time
i
m
sure
the
opening
is
good
enough
for
any
book
ever
written
just
listen
it
sounds
better
read
aloud
than
when
you
pore
over
it
silently
the
court
of
kellyon
castle
a
romance
of
the
middle
ages
by
ernest
field
in
the
belief
that
we
were
for
a
while
escaping
the
monotonous
repetition
of
wearisome
details
in
modern
social
scenery
analyses
of
uninteresting
character
or
the
unnatural
unfoldings
of
a
sensation
plot
we
took
this
volume
into
our
hands
with
a
feeling
of
pleasure
we
were
disposed
to
beguile
ourselves
with
the
fancy
that
some
new
change
might
possibly
be
rung
upon
donjon
keeps
chain
and
plate
armour
deeply
scarred
cheeks
tender
maidens
disguised
as
pages
to
which
we
had
not
listened
long
now
that
s
a
very
good
beginning
in
my
opinion
and
one
to
be
proud
of
having
brought
out
of
a
man
who
has
never
seen
ah
yes
murmured
elfride
wofully
but
then
see
further
on
well
the
next
bit
is
rather
unkind
i
must
own
said
swancourt
and
read
on
instead
of
this
we
found
ourselves
in
the
hands
of
some
young
lady
hardly
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
to
judge
by
the
silly
device
it
has
been
thought
worth
while
to
adopt
on
the
with
the
idea
of
disguising
her
i
am
not
silly
said
elfride
indignantly
he
might
have
called
me
anything
but
you
are
not
indeed
well
hands
of
a
young
lady
whose
chapters
are
simply
devoted
to
impossible
tournaments
towers
and
escapades
which
read
like
flat
copies
of
like
scenes
in
the
stories
of
james
and
the
most
unreal
portions
of
ivanhoe
the
bait
is
so
palpably
artificial
that
the
most
credulous
gudgeon
turns
now
my
dear
i
don
t
see
overmuch
to
complain
of
in
that
it
proves
that
you
were
clever
enough
to
make
him
think
of
sir
walter
scott
which
is
a
great
oh
yes
though
i
can
not
romance
myself
i
am
able
to
remind
him
of
those
who
can
elfride
intended
to
hurl
these
words
sarcastically
at
her
invisible
enemy
but
as
she
had
no
more
satirical
power
than
a
they
merely
fell
in
a
pretty
murmur
from
lips
shaped
to
a
pout
certainly
and
that
s
something
your
book
is
good
enough
to
be
bad
in
an
ordinary
literary
manner
and
doesn
t
stand
by
itself
in
a
melancholy
position
altogether
worse
than
that
interest
in
an
historical
romance
may
nowadays
have
any
chance
of
being
sustained
it
is
indispensable
that
the
reader
find
himself
under
the
guidance
of
some
nearly
extinct
species
of
legendary
who
in
addition
to
an
impulse
towards
antiquarian
research
and
an
unweakened
faith
in
the
mediaeval
halo
shall
possess
an
inventive
faculty
in
which
delicacy
of
sentiment
is
far
overtopped
by
a
power
of
welding
to
stirring
incident
a
spirited
variety
of
the
elementary
human
well
that
effusion
doesn
t
refer
to
you
at
all
elfride
merely
something
put
in
to
fill
up
let
me
see
when
does
he
come
to
you
again
not
till
the
very
end
actually
here
you
are
finally
polished
off
but
to
return
to
the
little
work
we
have
used
as
the
text
of
this
article
we
are
far
from
altogether
disparaging
the
author
s
powers
she
has
a
certain
versatility
that
enables
her
to
use
with
effect
a
style
of
narration
peculiar
to
herself
which
may
be
called
a
murmuring
of
delicate
emotional
trifles
the
particular
gift
of
those
to
whom
the
social
sympathies
of
a
peaceful
time
are
as
daily
food
hence
where
matters
of
domestic
experience
and
the
natural
touches
which
make
people
real
can
be
introduced
without
anachronisms
too
striking
she
is
occasionally
felicitous
and
upon
the
whole
we
feel
justified
in
saying
that
the
book
will
bear
looking
into
for
the
sake
of
those
portions
which
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
well
i
suppose
it
is
intended
for
satire
but
don
t
think
anything
more
of
it
now
my
dear
it
is
seven
o
and
swancourt
rang
for
her
maid
attack
is
more
piquant
than
concord
stephen
s
letter
was
concerning
nothing
but
oneness
with
her
the
review
was
the
very
reverse
and
a
stranger
with
neither
name
nor
shape
age
nor
appearance
but
a
mighty
voice
is
naturally
rather
an
interesting
novelty
to
a
lady
he
chooses
to
address
when
elfride
fell
asleep
that
night
she
was
loving
the
writer
of
the
letter
but
thinking
of
the
writer
of
that
article
chapter
xvi
then
fancy
shapes
as
fancy
on
a
day
about
three
weeks
later
the
swancourt
trio
were
sitting
quietly
in
the
of
the
crags
swancourt
s
house
at
endelstow
chatting
and
taking
easeful
survey
of
their
previous
month
or
two
of
town
a
tangible
weariness
even
to
people
whose
acquaintances
there
might
be
counted
on
the
fingers
a
mere
season
in
london
with
her
practised
had
so
advanced
elfride
s
perceptions
that
her
courtship
by
stephen
seemed
emotionally
meagre
and
to
have
drifted
back
several
years
into
a
childish
past
in
regarding
our
mental
experiences
as
in
visual
observation
our
own
progress
reads
like
a
dwindling
of
that
we
progress
from
she
was
seated
on
a
low
chair
looking
over
her
romance
with
melancholy
interest
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
become
acquainted
with
the
remarks
of
the
present
thereupon
still
thinking
of
that
reviewer
elfie
not
of
him
personally
but
i
am
thinking
of
his
opinion
really
on
looking
into
the
volume
after
this
long
time
has
elapsed
he
seems
to
have
estimated
one
part
of
it
fairly
no
no
i
wouldn
t
show
the
white
feather
now
fancy
that
of
all
people
in
the
world
the
writer
herself
should
go
over
to
the
enemy
how
shall
monmouth
s
men
fight
when
monmouth
runs
away
i
don
t
do
that
but
i
think
he
is
right
in
some
of
his
arguments
though
wrong
in
others
and
because
he
has
some
claim
to
my
respect
i
regret
all
the
more
that
he
should
think
so
mistakenly
of
my
motives
in
one
or
two
instances
it
is
more
vexing
to
be
misunderstood
than
to
be
misrepresented
and
he
misunderstands
me
i
can
not
be
easy
whilst
a
person
goes
to
rest
night
after
night
attributing
to
me
intentions
i
never
he
doesn
t
know
your
name
or
anything
about
you
and
he
has
doubtless
forgotten
there
is
such
a
book
in
existence
by
this
i
myself
should
certainly
like
him
to
be
put
right
upon
one
or
two
matters
said
the
vicar
who
had
hitherto
been
silent
you
see
critics
go
on
writing
and
are
never
corrected
or
argued
with
and
therefore
are
never
papa
said
elfride
brightening
write
to
him
i
would
as
soon
write
to
him
as
look
at
him
for
the
matter
of
that
said
swancourt
do
and
say
the
young
person
who
wrote
the
book
did
not
adopt
a
masculine
pseudonym
in
vanity
or
conceit
but
because
she
was
afraid
it
would
be
thought
presumptuous
to
publish
her
name
and
that
she
did
not
mean
the
story
for
such
as
he
but
as
a
sweetener
of
history
for
young
people
who
might
thereby
acquire
a
taste
for
what
went
on
in
their
own
country
hundreds
of
years
ago
and
be
tempted
to
dive
deeper
into
the
subject
oh
there
is
so
much
to
explain
i
wish
i
might
write
myself
now
elfie
i
ll
tell
you
what
we
will
do
answered
swancourt
tickled
with
a
sort
of
bucolic
humour
at
the
idea
of
criticizing
the
critic
you
shall
write
a
clear
account
of
what
he
is
wrong
in
and
i
will
copy
it
and
send
it
as
yes
now
directly
said
elfride
jumping
up
when
will
you
send
it
papa
oh
in
a
day
or
two
i
suppose
he
returned
then
the
vicar
paused
and
slightly
yawned
and
in
the
manner
of
elderly
people
began
to
cool
from
his
ardour
for
the
undertaking
now
that
it
came
to
the
point
but
really
it
is
hardly
worth
while
he
said
o
papa
said
elfride
with
much
disappointment
you
said
you
would
and
now
you
won
t
that
is
not
fair
but
how
can
we
send
it
if
we
don
t
know
whom
to
send
it
to
if
you
really
want
to
send
such
a
thing
it
can
easily
be
done
said
swancourt
coming
to
her
s
rescue
an
envelope
addressed
to
the
critic
of
the
court
of
kellyon
castle
care
of
the
editor
of
the
present
would
find
yes
i
suppose
it
why
not
write
your
answer
yourself
elfride
swancourt
inquired
i
might
she
said
hesitatingly
and
send
it
anonymously
that
would
be
treating
him
as
he
has
treated
no
use
in
the
world
but
i
don
t
like
to
let
him
know
my
exact
name
suppose
i
put
my
initials
only
the
less
you
are
known
the
more
you
are
thought
yes
you
might
do
elfride
set
to
work
there
and
then
her
one
desire
for
the
last
fortnight
seemed
likely
to
be
realized
as
happens
with
sensitive
and
secluded
minds
a
continual
dwelling
upon
the
subject
had
magnified
to
colossal
proportions
the
space
she
assumed
herself
to
occupy
or
to
have
occupied
in
the
occult
critic
s
mind
at
noon
and
at
night
she
had
been
pestering
herself
with
endeavours
to
perceive
more
distinctly
his
conception
of
her
as
a
woman
apart
from
an
author
whether
he
really
despised
her
whether
he
thought
more
or
less
of
her
than
of
ordinary
young
women
who
never
ventured
into
the
fire
of
criticism
at
all
now
she
would
have
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
at
any
rate
he
knew
her
true
intent
in
crossing
his
path
and
annoying
him
so
by
her
performance
and
be
taught
perhaps
to
despise
it
a
little
less
four
days
later
an
envelope
directed
to
miss
swancourt
in
a
strange
hand
made
its
appearance
from
the
oh
said
elfride
her
heart
sinking
within
her
can
it
be
from
that
man
a
lecture
for
impertinence
and
actually
one
for
swancourt
in
the
same
she
feared
to
open
hers
yet
how
can
he
know
my
name
no
it
is
somebody
nonsense
said
her
father
grimly
you
sent
your
initials
and
the
directory
was
available
though
he
wouldn
t
have
taken
the
trouble
to
look
there
unless
he
had
been
thoroughly
savage
with
you
i
thought
you
wrote
with
rather
more
asperity
than
simple
literary
discussion
this
timely
clause
was
introduced
to
save
the
character
of
the
vicar
s
judgment
under
any
issue
of
affairs
well
here
i
go
said
elfride
desperately
tearing
open
the
seal
to
be
sure
of
course
exclaimed
swancourt
and
looking
up
from
her
own
letter
christopher
i
quite
forgot
to
tell
you
when
i
mentioned
that
i
had
seen
my
distant
relative
harry
knight
that
i
invited
him
here
for
whatever
length
of
time
he
could
spare
and
now
he
says
he
can
come
any
day
in
write
and
say
the
first
of
the
month
replied
the
indiscriminate
vicar
she
read
on
goodness
me
and
that
isn
t
all
he
is
actually
the
reviewer
of
elfride
s
book
how
absurd
to
be
sure
i
had
no
idea
he
reviewed
novels
or
had
anything
to
do
with
the
present
he
is
a
barrister
and
i
thought
he
only
wrote
in
the
quarterlies
why
elfride
you
have
brought
about
an
odd
entanglement
what
does
he
say
to
you
elfride
had
put
down
her
letter
with
a
dissatisfied
flush
on
her
face
i
don
t
know
the
idea
of
his
knowing
my
name
and
all
about
me
why
he
says
nothing
particular
only
this
my
dear
madam
though
i
am
sorry
that
my
remarks
should
have
seemed
harsh
to
you
it
is
a
pleasure
to
find
that
they
have
been
the
means
of
bringing
forth
such
an
ingeniously
argued
reply
unfortunately
it
is
so
long
since
i
wrote
my
review
that
my
memory
does
not
serve
me
sufficiently
to
say
a
single
word
in
my
defence
even
supposing
there
remains
one
to
be
said
which
is
doubtful
you
will
find
from
a
letter
i
have
written
to
swancourt
that
we
are
not
such
strangers
to
each
other
as
we
have
been
imagining
possibly
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
soon
when
any
argument
you
choose
to
advance
shall
receive
all
the
attention
it
that
is
dim
sarcasm
i
know
it
oh
no
and
then
his
remarks
didn
t
seem
harsh
i
mean
i
did
not
say
he
thinks
you
are
in
a
frightful
temper
said
swancourt
chuckling
in
undertones
and
he
will
come
and
see
me
and
find
the
authoress
as
contemptible
in
speech
as
she
has
been
impertinent
in
manner
i
do
heartily
wish
i
had
never
written
a
word
to
him
never
mind
said
swancourt
also
laughing
in
low
quiet
jerks
it
will
make
the
meeting
such
a
comical
affair
and
afford
splendid
for
your
father
and
myself
the
idea
of
our
running
our
heads
against
harry
knight
all
the
time
i
can
not
get
over
the
vicar
had
immediately
remembered
the
name
to
be
that
of
stephen
smith
s
preceptor
and
friend
but
having
ceased
to
concern
himself
in
the
matter
he
made
no
remark
to
that
effect
consistently
forbearing
to
allude
to
anything
which
could
restore
recollection
of
the
to
him
disagreeable
mistake
with
regard
to
poor
stephen
s
lineage
and
position
elfride
had
of
course
perceived
the
same
thing
which
added
to
the
complication
of
relationship
a
mesh
that
her
stepmother
knew
nothing
of
the
identification
scarcely
heightened
knight
s
attractions
now
though
a
twelvemonth
ago
she
would
only
have
cared
to
see
him
for
the
interest
he
possessed
as
stephen
s
friend
fortunately
for
knight
s
advent
such
a
reason
for
welcome
had
only
begun
to
be
awkward
to
her
at
a
time
when
the
interest
he
had
acquired
on
his
own
account
made
it
no
longer
necessary
these
coincidences
in
common
with
all
relating
to
him
tended
to
keep
elfride
s
mind
upon
the
stretch
concerning
knight
as
was
her
custom
when
upon
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
she
walked
off
by
herself
among
the
laurel
bushes
and
there
standing
still
and
splitting
up
a
leaf
without
removing
it
from
its
stalk
fetched
back
recollections
of
stephen
s
frequent
words
in
praise
of
his
friend
and
wished
she
had
listened
more
attentively
then
still
pulling
the
leaf
she
would
blush
at
some
fancied
mortification
that
would
accrue
to
her
from
his
words
when
they
met
in
consequence
of
her
intrusiveness
as
she
now
considered
it
in
writing
to
him
the
next
development
of
her
meditations
was
the
subject
of
what
this
man
s
personal
appearance
might
be
was
he
tall
or
short
dark
or
fair
gay
or
grim
she
would
have
asked
swancourt
but
for
the
risk
she
might
thereby
incur
of
some
teasing
remark
being
returned
ultimately
elfride
would
say
oh
what
a
plague
that
reviewer
is
to
me
and
turn
her
face
to
where
she
imagined
india
lay
and
murmur
to
herself
ah
my
little
husband
what
are
you
doing
now
let
me
see
where
are
you
south
east
where
behind
that
hill
ever
so
far
behind
chapter
xvii
her
welcome
spoke
in
faltering
there
is
henry
knight
i
declare
said
swancourt
one
day
they
were
gazing
from
the
jutting
angle
of
a
wild
enclosure
not
far
from
the
crags
which
almost
overhung
the
valley
already
described
as
leading
up
from
the
sea
and
little
port
of
castle
boterel
the
stony
escarpment
upon
which
they
stood
had
the
contour
of
a
man
s
face
and
it
was
covered
with
furze
as
with
a
beard
people
in
the
field
above
were
preserved
from
an
accidental
roll
down
these
prominences
and
hollows
by
a
hedge
on
the
very
crest
which
was
doing
that
kindly
service
for
elfride
and
her
mother
now
scrambling
higher
into
the
hedge
and
stretching
her
neck
further
over
the
furze
elfride
beheld
the
individual
signified
he
was
walking
leisurely
along
the
little
green
path
at
the
bottom
beside
the
stream
a
satchel
slung
upon
his
left
hip
a
stout
in
his
hand
and
a
upon
his
head
the
satchel
was
worn
and
old
and
the
outer
polished
surface
of
the
leather
was
cracked
and
peeling
off
knight
having
arrived
over
the
hills
to
castle
boterel
upon
the
top
of
a
crazy
omnibus
preferred
to
walk
the
remaining
two
miles
up
the
valley
leaving
his
luggage
to
be
brought
on
behind
him
wandered
a
boy
of
whom
knight
had
briefly
inquired
the
way
to
endelstow
and
by
that
natural
law
of
physics
which
causes
lesser
bodies
to
gravitate
towards
the
greater
this
boy
had
kept
near
to
knight
and
trotted
like
a
little
dog
close
at
his
heels
whistling
as
he
went
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
knight
s
boots
as
they
rose
and
fell
when
they
had
reached
a
point
precisely
opposite
that
in
which
and
miss
swancourt
lay
in
ambush
knight
stopped
and
turned
round
look
here
my
boy
he
said
the
boy
parted
his
lips
opened
his
eyes
and
answered
nothing
here
s
sixpence
for
you
on
condition
that
you
don
t
again
come
within
twenty
yards
of
my
heels
all
the
way
up
the
the
boy
who
apparently
had
not
known
he
had
been
looking
at
knight
s
heels
at
all
took
the
sixpence
mechanically
and
knight
went
on
again
wrapt
in
meditation
a
nice
voice
elfride
thought
but
what
a
singular
temper
now
we
must
get
indoors
before
he
ascends
the
slope
said
swancourt
softly
and
they
went
across
by
a
short
cut
over
a
stile
entering
the
lawn
by
a
side
door
and
so
on
to
the
house
swancourt
had
gone
into
the
village
with
the
curate
and
elfride
felt
too
nervous
to
await
their
visitor
s
arrival
in
the
with
swancourt
so
that
when
the
elder
lady
entered
elfride
made
some
pretence
of
perceiving
a
new
variety
of
crimson
geranium
and
lingered
behind
among
the
flower
beds
there
was
nothing
gained
by
this
after
all
she
thought
and
a
few
minutes
after
boldly
came
into
the
house
by
the
glass
she
walked
along
the
corridor
and
entered
the
nobody
was
there
a
window
at
the
angle
of
the
room
opened
directly
into
an
octagonal
conservatory
enclosing
the
corner
of
the
building
from
the
conservatory
came
voices
in
conversation
swancourt
s
and
the
stranger
s
she
had
expected
him
to
talk
brilliantly
to
her
surprise
he
was
asking
questions
in
quite
a
learner
s
manner
on
subjects
connected
with
the
flowers
and
shrubs
that
she
had
known
for
years
when
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
he
spoke
at
some
length
she
considered
there
was
a
hard
square
decisiveness
in
the
shape
of
his
sentences
as
if
unlike
her
own
and
stephen
s
they
were
not
there
and
then
newly
constructed
but
were
drawn
forth
from
a
large
store
they
were
now
approaching
the
window
to
come
in
again
that
is
a
variety
said
swancourt
but
oleanders
though
they
are
such
bulky
shrubs
are
so
very
easily
wounded
as
to
be
unprunable
giants
with
the
sensitiveness
of
young
ladies
oh
here
is
elfride
elfride
looked
as
guilty
and
crestfallen
as
lady
teazle
at
the
dropping
of
the
screen
swancourt
presented
him
half
comically
and
knight
in
a
minute
or
two
placed
himself
beside
the
young
lady
a
complexity
of
instincts
checked
elfride
s
conventional
smiles
of
complaisance
and
hospitality
and
to
make
her
still
less
comfortable
swancourt
immediately
afterwards
left
them
together
to
seek
her
husband
knight
however
did
not
seem
at
all
incommoded
by
his
feelings
and
he
said
with
light
easefulness
so
miss
swancourt
i
have
met
you
at
last
you
escaped
me
by
a
few
minutes
only
when
we
were
in
yes
i
found
that
you
had
seen
and
now
reviewer
and
reviewed
are
face
to
face
he
added
unconcernedly
yes
though
the
fact
of
your
being
a
relation
of
swancourt
s
takes
off
the
edge
of
it
it
was
strange
that
you
should
be
one
of
her
family
all
the
elfride
began
to
recover
herself
now
and
to
look
into
knight
s
face
i
was
merely
anxious
to
let
you
know
my
real
meaning
in
writing
the
book
extremely
i
can
quite
understand
the
wish
and
i
was
gratified
that
my
remarks
should
have
reached
home
they
very
seldom
do
i
am
elfride
drew
herself
in
here
he
was
sticking
to
his
opinions
as
firmly
as
if
friendship
and
politeness
did
not
in
the
least
require
an
immediate
renunciation
of
them
you
made
me
very
uneasy
and
sorry
by
writing
such
things
she
murmured
suddenly
dropping
the
mere
cacueterie
of
a
fashionable
first
introduction
and
speaking
with
some
of
the
dudgeon
of
a
child
towards
a
severe
schoolmaster
that
is
rather
the
object
of
honest
critics
in
such
a
case
not
to
cause
unnecessary
sorrow
but
to
make
you
sorry
after
a
proper
manner
that
ye
may
receive
damage
by
us
in
nothing
as
a
powerful
pen
once
wrote
to
the
gentiles
are
you
going
to
write
another
romance
write
another
she
said
that
somebody
may
pen
a
condemnation
and
nail
t
wi
scripture
again
as
you
do
now
knight
you
may
do
better
next
time
he
said
placidly
i
think
you
will
but
i
would
advise
you
to
confine
yourself
to
domestic
thank
you
but
never
again
well
you
may
be
right
that
a
young
woman
has
taken
to
writing
is
not
by
any
means
the
best
thing
to
hear
about
what
is
the
best
i
prefer
not
to
do
you
know
then
do
tell
me
well
knight
was
evidently
changing
his
meaning
i
suppose
to
hear
that
she
has
elfride
hesitated
and
what
when
she
has
been
married
she
said
at
last
partly
in
order
to
withdraw
her
own
person
from
the
argument
then
to
hear
no
more
about
her
it
is
as
smeaton
said
of
his
lighthouse
her
greatest
real
praise
when
the
novelty
of
her
inauguration
has
worn
off
is
that
nothing
happens
to
keep
the
talk
of
her
yes
i
see
said
elfride
softly
and
thoughtfully
but
of
course
it
is
different
quite
with
men
why
don
t
you
write
novels
knight
because
i
couldn
t
write
one
that
would
interest
why
for
several
reasons
it
requires
a
judicious
omission
of
your
real
thoughts
to
make
a
novel
popular
for
one
is
that
really
necessary
well
i
am
sure
you
could
learn
to
do
that
with
practice
said
elfride
with
an
air
as
became
a
person
who
spoke
from
experience
in
the
art
you
would
make
a
great
name
for
certain
she
continued
so
many
people
make
a
name
nowadays
that
it
is
more
distinguished
to
remain
in
tell
me
seriously
apart
from
the
subject
why
don
t
you
write
a
volume
instead
of
loose
articles
she
insisted
since
you
are
pleased
to
make
me
talk
of
myself
i
will
tell
you
seriously
said
knight
not
less
amused
at
this
catechism
by
his
young
friend
than
he
was
interested
in
her
appearance
as
i
have
implied
i
have
not
the
wish
and
if
i
had
the
wish
i
could
not
now
concentrate
sufficiently
we
all
have
only
our
one
cruse
of
energy
given
us
to
make
the
best
of
and
where
that
energy
has
been
leaked
away
week
by
week
quarter
by
quarter
as
mine
has
for
the
last
nine
or
ten
years
there
is
not
enough
dammed
back
behind
the
mill
at
any
given
period
to
supply
the
force
a
complete
book
on
any
subject
requires
then
there
is
the
and
waiting
power
where
quick
results
have
grown
customary
they
are
fatal
to
a
lively
faith
in
the
yes
i
comprehend
and
so
you
choose
to
write
in
fragments
no
i
don
t
choose
to
do
it
in
the
sense
you
mean
choosing
from
a
whole
world
of
professions
all
possible
it
was
by
the
constraint
of
accident
merely
not
that
i
object
to
the
why
don
t
you
object
i
mean
why
do
you
feel
so
quiet
about
things
elfride
was
half
afraid
to
question
him
so
but
her
intense
curiosity
to
see
what
the
inside
of
literary
knight
was
like
kept
her
going
on
knight
certainly
did
not
mind
being
frank
with
her
instances
of
this
trait
in
men
who
are
not
without
feeling
but
are
reticent
from
habit
may
be
recalled
by
all
of
us
when
they
find
a
listener
who
can
by
no
possibility
make
use
of
them
rival
them
or
condemn
them
reserved
and
even
suspicious
men
of
the
world
become
frank
keenly
enjoying
the
inner
side
of
their
frankness
why
i
don
t
mind
the
accidental
constraint
he
replied
is
because
in
making
beginnings
a
chance
limitation
of
direction
is
often
better
than
absolute
i
see
that
is
i
should
if
i
quite
understood
what
all
those
generalities
why
this
that
an
arbitrary
foundation
for
one
s
work
which
no
length
of
thought
can
alter
leaves
the
attention
free
to
fix
itself
on
the
work
itself
and
make
the
best
of
lateral
compression
forcing
altitude
as
would
be
said
in
that
tongue
she
said
mischievously
and
i
suppose
where
no
limit
exists
as
in
the
case
of
a
rich
man
with
a
wide
taste
who
wants
to
do
something
it
will
be
better
to
choose
a
limit
capriciously
than
to
have
yes
he
said
meditatively
i
can
go
as
far
as
well
resumed
elfride
i
think
it
better
for
a
man
s
nature
if
he
does
nothing
in
there
is
such
a
case
as
being
obliged
yes
yes
i
was
speaking
of
when
you
are
not
obliged
for
any
other
reason
than
delight
in
the
prospect
of
fame
i
have
thought
many
times
lately
that
a
thin
widespread
happiness
commencing
now
and
of
a
piece
with
the
days
of
your
life
is
preferable
to
an
anticipated
heap
far
away
in
the
future
and
none
why
that
s
the
very
thing
i
said
just
now
as
being
the
principle
of
all
ephemeral
doers
like
oh
i
am
sorry
to
have
parodied
you
she
said
with
some
confusion
yes
of
course
that
is
what
you
meant
about
not
trying
to
be
and
she
added
with
the
quickness
of
conviction
characteristic
of
her
mind
there
is
much
littleness
in
trying
to
be
great
a
man
must
think
a
good
deal
of
himself
and
be
conceited
enough
to
believe
in
himself
before
he
tries
at
but
it
is
soon
enough
to
say
there
is
harm
in
a
man
s
thinking
a
good
deal
of
himself
when
it
is
proved
he
has
been
thinking
wrong
and
too
soon
then
sometimes
besides
we
should
not
conclude
that
a
man
who
strives
earnestly
for
success
does
so
with
a
strong
sense
of
his
own
merit
he
may
see
how
little
success
has
to
do
with
merit
and
his
motive
may
be
his
very
this
manner
of
treating
her
rather
provoked
elfride
no
sooner
did
she
agree
with
him
than
he
ceased
to
seem
to
wish
it
and
took
the
other
side
ah
she
thought
inwardly
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
man
of
this
kind
though
he
is
our
i
think
you
will
find
resumed
knight
pursuing
the
conversation
more
for
the
sake
of
finishing
off
his
thoughts
on
the
subject
than
for
engaging
her
attention
that
in
actual
life
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
instinct
with
men
this
trying
to
push
on
they
awake
to
a
recognition
that
they
have
without
premeditation
begun
to
try
a
little
and
they
say
to
themselves
since
i
have
tried
thus
much
i
will
try
a
little
they
go
on
because
they
have
elfride
in
her
turn
was
not
particularly
attending
to
his
words
at
this
moment
she
had
unconsciously
to
herself
a
way
of
seizing
any
point
in
the
remarks
of
an
interlocutor
which
interested
her
and
dwelling
upon
it
and
thinking
thoughts
of
her
own
thereupon
totally
oblivious
of
all
that
he
might
say
in
continuation
on
such
occasions
she
artlessly
surveyed
the
person
speaking
and
then
there
was
a
time
for
a
painter
her
eyes
seemed
to
look
at
you
and
past
you
as
you
were
then
into
your
future
and
past
your
future
into
your
eternity
not
reading
it
but
gazing
in
an
unused
unconscious
way
her
mind
still
clinging
to
its
original
thought
this
is
how
she
was
looking
at
knight
suddenly
elfride
became
conscious
of
what
she
was
doing
and
was
painfully
confused
what
were
you
so
intent
upon
in
me
he
inquired
as
far
as
i
was
thinking
of
you
at
all
i
was
thinking
how
clever
you
are
she
said
with
a
want
of
premeditation
that
was
startling
in
its
honesty
and
simplicity
feeling
restless
now
that
she
had
so
unwittingly
spoken
she
arose
and
stepped
to
the
window
having
heard
the
voices
of
her
father
and
swancourt
coming
up
below
the
terrace
here
they
are
she
said
going
out
knight
walked
out
upon
the
lawn
behind
her
she
stood
upon
the
edge
of
the
terrace
close
to
the
stone
balustrade
and
looked
towards
the
sun
hanging
over
a
glade
just
now
fair
as
tempe
s
vale
up
which
her
father
was
walking
knight
could
not
help
looking
at
her
the
sun
was
within
ten
degrees
of
the
horizon
and
its
warm
light
flooded
her
face
and
heightened
the
bright
rose
colour
of
her
cheeks
to
a
vermilion
red
their
moderate
pink
hue
being
only
seen
in
its
natural
tone
where
the
cheek
curved
round
into
shadow
the
ends
of
her
hanging
hair
softly
dragged
themselves
backwards
and
forwards
upon
her
shoulder
as
each
faint
breeze
thrust
against
or
relinquished
it
fringes
and
ribbons
of
her
dress
moved
by
the
same
breeze
licked
like
tongues
upon
the
parts
around
them
and
fluttering
forward
from
shady
folds
caught
likewise
their
share
of
the
lustrous
orange
glow
swancourt
shouted
out
a
welcome
to
knight
from
a
distance
of
about
thirty
yards
and
after
a
few
preliminary
words
proceeded
to
a
conversation
of
deep
earnestness
on
knight
s
fine
old
family
name
and
theories
as
to
lineage
and
intermarriage
connected
therewith
knight
s
portmanteau
having
in
the
meantime
arrived
they
soon
retired
to
prepare
for
dinner
which
had
been
postponed
two
hours
later
than
the
usual
time
of
that
meal
an
arrival
was
an
event
in
the
life
of
elfride
now
that
they
were
again
in
the
country
and
that
of
knight
necessarily
an
engrossing
one
and
that
evening
she
went
to
bed
for
the
first
time
without
thinking
of
stephen
at
all
chapter
xviii
he
heard
her
musical
the
old
tower
of
west
endelstow
church
had
reached
the
last
weeks
of
its
existence
it
was
to
be
replaced
by
a
new
one
from
the
designs
of
hewby
the
architect
who
had
sent
down
stephen
planks
and
poles
had
arrived
in
the
churchyard
iron
bars
had
been
thrust
into
the
venerable
crack
extending
down
the
belfry
wall
to
the
foundation
the
bells
had
been
taken
down
the
owls
had
forsaken
this
home
of
their
forefathers
and
six
iconoclasts
in
white
fustian
to
whom
a
cracked
edifice
was
a
species
of
mumbo
jumbo
had
taken
lodgings
in
the
village
previous
to
beginning
the
actual
removal
of
the
stones
this
was
the
day
after
knight
s
arrival
to
enjoy
for
the
last
time
the
prospect
seaward
from
the
summit
the
vicar
swancourt
knight
and
elfride
all
ascended
the
winding
turret
swancourt
stepping
forward
with
many
loud
breaths
his
wife
struggling
along
silently
but
suffering
none
the
less
they
had
hardly
reached
the
top
when
a
large
lurid
cloud
palpably
a
reservoir
of
rain
thunder
and
lightning
was
seen
to
be
advancing
overhead
from
the
north
the
two
cautious
elders
suggested
an
immediate
return
and
proceeded
to
put
it
in
practice
as
regarded
themselves
dear
me
i
wish
i
had
not
come
up
exclaimed
swancourt
we
shall
be
slower
than
you
two
in
going
down
the
vicar
said
over
his
shoulder
and
so
don
t
you
start
till
we
are
nearly
at
the
bottom
or
you
will
run
over
us
and
break
our
necks
somewhere
in
the
darkness
of
the
accordingly
elfride
and
knight
waited
on
the
leads
till
the
staircase
should
be
clear
knight
was
not
in
a
talkative
mood
that
morning
elfride
was
rather
wilful
by
reason
of
his
inattention
which
she
privately
set
down
to
his
thinking
her
not
worth
talking
to
whilst
knight
stood
watching
the
rise
of
the
cloud
she
sauntered
to
the
other
side
of
the
tower
and
there
remembered
a
giddy
feat
she
had
performed
the
year
before
it
was
to
walk
round
upon
the
parapet
of
the
tower
which
was
quite
without
battlement
or
pinnacle
and
presented
a
smooth
flat
surface
about
two
feet
wide
forming
a
pathway
on
all
the
four
sides
without
reflecting
in
the
least
upon
what
she
was
doing
she
now
stepped
upon
the
parapet
in
the
old
way
and
began
walking
along
we
are
down
cousin
henry
cried
swancourt
up
the
turret
follow
us
when
you
knight
turned
and
saw
elfride
beginning
her
elevated
promenade
his
face
flushed
with
mingled
concern
and
anger
at
her
rashness
i
certainly
gave
you
credit
for
more
common
sense
he
said
she
reddened
a
little
and
walked
on
miss
swancourt
i
insist
upon
your
coming
down
he
exclaimed
i
will
in
a
minute
i
am
safe
enough
i
have
done
it
at
that
moment
by
reason
of
a
slight
perturbation
his
words
had
caused
in
her
elfride
s
foot
caught
itself
in
a
little
tuft
of
grass
growing
in
a
joint
of
the
and
she
almost
lost
her
balance
knight
sprang
forward
with
a
face
of
horror
by
what
seemed
the
special
interposition
of
a
considerate
providence
she
tottered
to
the
inner
edge
of
the
parapet
instead
of
to
the
outer
and
reeled
over
upon
the
lead
roof
two
or
three
feet
below
the
wall
knight
seized
her
as
in
a
vice
and
he
said
panting
that
ever
i
should
have
met
a
woman
fool
enough
to
do
a
thing
of
that
kind
good
god
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
the
close
proximity
of
the
shadow
of
death
had
made
her
sick
and
pale
as
a
corpse
before
he
spoke
already
lowered
to
that
state
his
words
completely
her
and
she
swooned
away
as
he
held
her
elfride
s
eyes
were
not
closed
for
more
than
forty
seconds
she
opened
them
and
remembered
the
position
instantly
his
face
had
altered
its
expression
from
stern
anger
to
pity
but
his
severe
remarks
had
rather
frightened
her
and
she
struggled
to
be
free
if
you
can
stand
of
course
you
may
he
said
and
loosened
his
arms
i
hardly
know
whether
most
to
laugh
at
your
freak
or
to
chide
you
for
its
she
immediately
sank
upon
the
knight
lifted
her
again
are
you
hurt
he
said
she
murmured
an
incoherent
expression
and
tried
to
smile
saying
with
a
fitful
aversion
of
her
face
i
am
only
frightened
put
me
down
do
put
me
down
but
you
can
t
walk
said
knight
you
don
t
know
that
how
can
you
i
am
only
frightened
i
tell
you
she
answered
petulantly
and
raised
her
hand
to
her
forehead
knight
then
saw
that
she
was
bleeding
from
a
severe
cut
in
her
wrist
apparently
where
it
had
descended
upon
a
salient
corner
of
the
elfride
too
seemed
to
perceive
and
feel
this
now
for
the
first
time
and
for
a
minute
nearly
lost
consciousness
again
knight
rapidly
bound
his
handkerchief
round
the
place
and
to
add
to
the
complication
the
thundercloud
he
had
been
watching
began
to
shed
some
heavy
drops
of
rain
knight
looked
up
and
saw
the
vicar
striding
towards
the
house
and
swancourt
waddling
beside
him
like
a
duck
as
you
are
so
faint
it
will
be
much
better
to
let
me
carry
you
down
said
knight
or
at
any
rate
inside
out
of
the
but
her
objection
to
be
lifted
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
support
her
for
more
than
five
steps
this
is
folly
great
folly
he
exclaimed
setting
her
down
indeed
she
murmured
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
say
i
will
not
be
carried
and
you
say
this
is
folly
so
it
no
it
isn
t
it
is
folly
i
think
at
any
rate
the
origin
of
it
all
i
don
t
agree
to
it
and
you
needn
t
get
so
angry
with
me
i
am
not
worth
indeed
you
are
you
are
worth
the
enmity
of
princes
as
was
said
of
such
another
now
then
will
you
clasp
your
hands
behind
my
neck
that
i
may
carry
you
down
without
hurting
you
no
you
had
better
or
i
shall
what
s
that
deprive
you
of
your
elfride
gave
a
little
toss
now
don
t
writhe
so
when
i
attempt
to
carry
i
can
t
help
then
submit
i
don
t
care
i
don
t
care
she
murmured
in
languid
tones
and
with
closed
eyes
he
took
her
into
his
arms
entered
the
turret
and
with
slow
and
cautious
steps
descended
round
and
round
then
with
the
gentleness
of
a
nursing
mother
he
attended
to
the
cut
on
her
arm
during
his
progress
through
the
operations
of
wiping
it
and
binding
it
up
anew
her
face
changed
its
aspect
from
pained
indifference
to
something
like
bashful
interest
interspersed
with
small
tremors
and
shudders
of
a
trifling
kind
in
the
centre
of
each
pale
cheek
a
small
red
spot
the
size
of
a
wafer
had
now
made
its
appearance
and
continued
to
grow
larger
elfride
momentarily
expected
a
recurrence
to
the
lecture
on
her
foolishness
but
knight
said
no
more
than
this
promise
me
never
to
walk
on
that
parapet
it
will
be
pulled
down
soon
so
i
in
a
few
minutes
she
continued
in
a
lower
tone
and
seriously
you
are
familiar
of
course
as
everybody
is
with
those
strange
sensations
we
sometimes
have
that
our
life
for
the
moment
exists
in
that
we
have
lived
through
that
moment
before
or
shall
again
well
i
felt
on
the
tower
that
something
similar
to
that
scene
is
again
to
be
common
to
us
god
forbid
said
knight
promise
me
that
you
will
never
again
walk
on
any
such
place
on
any
i
that
such
a
thing
has
not
been
before
we
know
that
it
shall
not
be
again
you
vow
therefore
think
no
more
of
such
a
foolish
there
had
fallen
a
great
deal
of
rain
but
unaccompanied
by
lightning
a
few
minutes
longer
and
the
storm
had
ceased
now
take
my
arm
oh
no
it
is
not
this
relapse
into
wilfulness
was
because
he
had
again
connected
the
epithet
foolish
with
her
nonsense
it
is
quite
necessary
it
will
rain
again
directly
and
you
are
not
half
and
without
more
ado
knight
took
her
hand
drew
it
under
his
arm
and
held
it
there
so
firmly
that
she
could
not
have
removed
it
without
a
struggle
feeling
like
a
colt
in
a
halter
for
the
first
time
at
thus
being
led
along
yet
afraid
to
be
angry
it
was
to
her
great
relief
that
she
saw
the
carriage
coming
round
the
corner
to
fetch
them
her
fall
upon
the
roof
was
necessarily
explained
to
some
extent
upon
their
entering
the
house
but
both
forbore
to
mention
a
word
of
what
she
had
been
doing
to
cause
such
an
accident
during
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
elfride
was
invisible
but
at
she
appeared
as
bright
as
ever
in
the
after
having
been
exclusively
engaged
with
and
swancourt
through
the
intervening
hour
knight
again
found
himself
thrown
with
elfride
she
had
been
looking
over
a
chess
problem
in
one
of
the
illustrated
periodicals
you
like
chess
miss
swancourt
yes
it
is
my
favourite
scientific
game
indeed
excludes
every
other
do
you
play
i
have
played
though
not
challenge
him
elfride
said
the
vicar
heartily
she
plays
very
well
for
a
lady
shall
we
play
asked
elfride
tentatively
oh
certainly
i
shall
be
the
game
began
swancourt
had
forgotten
a
similar
performance
with
stephen
smith
the
year
before
elfride
had
not
but
she
had
begun
to
take
for
her
maxim
the
undoubted
truth
that
the
necessity
of
continuing
faithful
to
stephen
without
suspicion
dictated
a
fickle
behaviour
almost
as
imperatively
as
fickleness
itself
a
fact
however
which
would
give
a
startling
advantage
to
the
latter
quality
should
it
ever
appear
knight
by
one
of
those
inexcusable
oversights
which
will
sometimes
afflict
the
best
of
players
placed
his
rook
in
the
arms
of
one
of
her
pawns
it
was
her
first
advantage
she
looked
triumphant
even
ruthless
by
george
what
was
i
thinking
of
said
knight
quietly
and
then
dismissed
all
concern
at
his
accident
club
laws
we
ll
have
won
t
we
knight
said
elfride
suasively
oh
yes
certainly
said
knight
a
thought
however
just
occurring
to
his
mind
that
he
had
two
or
three
times
allowed
her
to
replace
a
man
on
her
religiously
assuring
him
that
such
a
move
was
an
absolute
blunder
she
immediately
took
up
the
unfortunate
rook
and
the
contest
proceeded
elfride
having
now
rather
the
better
of
the
game
then
he
won
the
exchange
regained
his
position
and
began
to
press
her
hard
elfride
grew
flurried
and
placed
her
queen
on
his
remaining
rook
s
file
there
how
stupid
upon
my
word
i
did
not
see
your
rook
of
course
nobody
but
a
fool
would
have
put
a
queen
there
knowingly
she
spoke
excitedly
half
expecting
her
antagonist
to
give
her
back
the
move
nobody
of
course
said
knight
serenely
and
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
his
royal
victim
it
is
not
very
pleasant
to
have
it
taken
advantage
of
then
she
said
with
some
vexation
club
laws
i
think
you
said
returned
knight
blandly
and
mercilessly
appropriating
the
queen
she
was
on
the
brink
of
pouting
but
was
ashamed
to
show
it
tears
almost
stood
in
her
eyes
she
had
been
trying
so
hard
so
very
hard
thinking
and
thinking
till
her
brain
was
in
a
whirl
and
it
seemed
so
heartless
of
him
to
treat
her
so
after
all
i
think
it
is
she
began
what
unkind
to
take
advantage
of
a
pure
mistake
i
make
in
that
i
lost
my
rook
by
even
a
purer
mistake
said
the
enemy
in
an
inexorable
tone
without
lifting
his
eyes
yes
but
however
as
his
logic
was
absolutely
unanswerable
she
merely
registered
a
protest
i
can
not
endure
those
ways
of
clubs
and
professional
players
like
staunton
and
morphy
just
as
if
it
really
mattered
whether
you
have
raised
your
fingers
from
a
man
or
no
knight
smiled
as
pitilessly
as
before
and
they
went
on
in
silence
checkmate
said
knight
another
game
said
elfride
peremptorily
and
looking
very
warm
with
all
my
heart
said
knight
checkmate
said
knight
again
at
the
end
of
forty
minutes
another
game
she
returned
resolutely
i
ll
give
you
the
odds
of
a
bishop
knight
said
to
her
kindly
no
thank
you
elfride
replied
in
a
tone
intended
for
courteous
indifference
but
as
a
fact
very
cavalier
indeed
checkmate
said
her
opponent
without
the
least
emotion
oh
the
difference
between
elfride
s
condition
of
mind
now
and
when
she
purposely
made
blunders
that
stephen
smith
might
win
it
was
bedtime
her
mind
as
distracted
as
if
it
would
throb
itself
out
of
her
head
she
went
off
to
her
chamber
full
of
mortification
at
being
beaten
time
after
time
when
she
herself
was
the
aggressor
having
for
two
or
three
years
enjoyed
the
reputation
throughout
the
globe
of
her
father
s
brain
which
almost
constituted
her
entire
world
of
being
an
excellent
player
this
fiasco
was
intolerable
for
unfortunately
the
person
most
dogged
in
the
belief
in
a
false
reputation
is
always
that
one
the
possessor
who
has
the
best
means
of
knowing
that
it
is
not
true
in
bed
no
sleep
came
to
soothe
her
that
gentle
thing
being
the
very
friend
in
this
respect
of
flying
away
at
the
merest
troublous
cloud
after
lying
awake
till
two
o
clock
an
idea
seemed
to
strike
her
she
softly
arose
got
a
light
and
fetched
a
chess
praxis
from
the
library
returning
and
sitting
up
in
bed
she
diligently
studied
the
volume
till
the
clock
struck
five
and
her
eyelids
felt
thick
and
heavy
she
then
extinguished
the
light
and
lay
down
again
you
look
pale
elfride
said
swancourt
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
isn
t
she
cousin
harry
a
young
girl
who
is
scarcely
ill
at
all
can
hardly
help
becoming
so
when
regarded
as
such
by
all
eyes
turning
upon
her
at
the
table
in
obedience
to
some
remark
everybody
looked
at
elfride
she
certainly
was
pale
am
i
pale
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
i
did
not
sleep
much
i
could
not
get
rid
of
armies
of
bishops
and
knights
try
how
i
chess
is
a
bad
thing
just
before
bedtime
especially
for
excitable
people
like
yourself
dear
don
t
ever
play
late
i
ll
play
early
instead
cousin
knight
she
said
in
imitation
of
swancourt
will
you
oblige
me
in
something
even
to
half
my
well
it
is
to
play
one
game
when
now
instantly
the
moment
we
have
nonsense
elfride
said
her
father
making
yourself
a
slave
to
the
game
like
but
i
want
to
papa
honestly
i
am
restless
at
having
been
so
ignominiously
overcome
and
knight
doesn
t
mind
so
what
harm
can
there
be
let
us
play
by
all
means
if
you
wish
it
said
knight
so
when
breakfast
was
over
the
combatants
withdrew
to
the
quiet
of
the
library
and
the
door
was
closed
elfride
seemed
to
have
an
idea
that
her
conduct
was
rather
and
startlingly
free
from
conventional
restraint
and
worse
she
fancied
upon
knight
s
face
a
slightly
amused
look
at
her
proceedings
you
think
me
foolish
i
suppose
she
said
recklessly
but
i
want
to
do
my
very
best
just
once
and
see
whether
i
can
overcome
certainly
nothing
more
natural
though
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
the
plan
adopted
by
women
of
the
world
after
a
why
pray
because
they
know
that
as
good
as
overcoming
is
skill
in
effacing
recollection
of
being
overcome
and
turn
their
attention
to
that
i
am
wrong
again
of
perhaps
your
wrong
is
more
pleasing
than
their
i
don
t
quite
know
whether
you
mean
that
or
whether
you
are
laughing
at
me
she
said
looking
doubtingly
at
him
yet
inclining
to
accept
the
more
flattering
interpretation
i
am
almost
sure
you
think
it
vanity
in
me
to
think
i
am
a
match
for
you
well
if
you
do
i
say
that
vanity
is
no
crime
in
such
a
well
perhaps
not
though
it
is
hardly
a
oh
yes
in
battle
nelson
s
bravery
lay
in
his
indeed
then
so
did
his
oh
no
no
for
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
prophet
shakespeare
fear
and
be
slain
no
worse
can
come
to
fight
and
fight
and
die
is
death
destroying
death
and
down
they
sat
and
the
contest
began
elfride
having
the
first
move
the
game
progressed
elfride
s
heart
beat
so
violently
that
she
could
not
sit
still
her
dread
was
lest
he
should
hear
it
and
he
did
discover
it
at
last
some
flowers
upon
the
table
being
set
throbbing
by
its
pulsations
i
think
we
had
better
give
over
said
knight
looking
at
her
gently
it
is
too
much
for
you
i
know
let
us
write
down
the
position
and
finish
another
no
please
not
she
implored
i
should
not
rest
if
i
did
not
know
the
result
at
once
it
is
your
ten
minutes
passed
she
started
up
suddenly
i
know
what
you
are
doing
she
cried
an
angry
colour
upon
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
indignant
you
were
thinking
of
letting
me
win
to
please
me
i
don
t
mind
owning
that
i
was
knight
responded
phlegmatically
and
appearing
all
the
more
so
by
contrast
with
her
own
turmoil
but
you
must
not
i
won
t
have
very
no
that
will
not
do
i
insist
that
you
promise
not
to
do
any
such
absurd
thing
it
is
insulting
me
very
well
madam
i
won
t
do
any
such
absurd
thing
you
shall
not
that
is
to
be
proved
she
returned
proudly
and
the
play
went
on
nothing
is
now
heard
but
the
ticking
of
a
quaint
old
timepiece
on
the
summit
of
a
bookcase
ten
minutes
pass
he
captures
her
knight
she
takes
his
knight
and
looks
a
very
rhadamanthus
more
minutes
tick
away
she
takes
his
pawn
and
has
the
advantage
showing
her
sense
of
it
rather
prominently
five
minutes
more
he
takes
her
bishop
she
brings
things
even
by
taking
his
knight
three
minutes
she
looks
bold
and
takes
his
queen
he
looks
placid
and
takes
hers
eight
or
ten
minutes
pass
he
takes
a
pawn
she
utters
a
little
pooh
but
not
the
ghost
of
a
pawn
can
she
take
in
retaliation
ten
minutes
pass
he
takes
another
pawn
and
says
check
she
flushes
extricates
herself
by
capturing
his
bishop
and
looks
triumphant
he
immediately
takes
her
bishop
she
looks
surprised
five
minutes
longer
she
makes
a
dash
and
takes
his
only
remaining
bishop
he
replies
by
taking
her
only
remaining
knight
two
minutes
he
gives
check
her
mind
is
now
in
a
painful
state
of
tension
and
she
shades
her
face
with
her
hand
yet
a
few
minutes
more
he
takes
her
rook
and
checks
again
she
literally
trembles
now
lest
an
artful
surprise
she
has
in
store
for
him
shall
be
anticipated
by
the
artful
surprise
he
evidently
has
in
store
for
her
five
minutes
checkmate
in
two
moves
exclaims
elfride
if
you
can
says
knight
oh
i
have
miscalculated
that
is
cruel
checkmate
says
knight
and
the
victory
is
won
elfride
arose
and
turned
away
without
letting
him
see
her
face
once
in
the
hall
she
ran
upstairs
and
into
her
room
and
flung
herself
down
upon
her
bed
weeping
bitterly
where
is
elfride
said
her
father
at
luncheon
knight
listened
anxiously
for
the
answer
he
had
been
hoping
to
see
her
again
before
this
time
she
isn
t
well
sir
was
the
reply
swancourt
rose
and
left
the
room
going
upstairs
to
elfride
s
apartment
at
the
door
was
unity
who
occupied
in
the
new
establishment
a
position
between
young
lady
s
maid
and
she
is
sound
asleep
ma
am
unity
whispered
swancourt
opened
the
door
elfride
was
lying
on
the
bed
her
face
hot
and
red
her
arms
thrown
abroad
at
intervals
of
a
minute
she
tossed
restlessly
from
side
to
side
and
indistinctly
moaned
words
used
in
the
game
of
chess
swancourt
had
a
turn
for
doctoring
and
felt
her
pulse
it
was
twanging
like
a
at
the
rate
of
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
minute
softly
moving
the
sleeping
girl
to
a
little
less
cramped
position
she
went
downstairs
again
she
is
asleep
now
said
swancourt
she
does
not
seem
very
well
cousin
knight
what
were
you
thinking
of
her
tender
brain
won
t
bear
cudgelling
like
your
great
head
you
should
have
strictly
forbidden
her
to
play
in
truth
the
essayist
s
experience
of
the
nature
of
young
women
was
far
less
extensive
than
his
abstract
knowledge
of
them
led
himself
and
others
to
believe
he
could
pack
them
into
sentences
like
a
workman
but
practically
was
nowhere
i
am
indeed
sorry
said
knight
feeling
even
more
than
he
expressed
but
surely
the
young
lady
knows
best
what
is
good
for
her
bless
you
that
s
just
what
she
doesn
t
know
she
never
thinks
of
such
things
does
she
christopher
her
father
and
i
have
to
command
her
and
keep
her
in
order
as
you
would
a
child
she
will
say
things
worthy
of
a
french
epigrammatist
and
act
like
a
robin
in
a
greenhouse
but
i
think
we
will
send
for
granson
there
can
be
no
a
man
was
straightway
despatched
on
horseback
to
castle
boterel
and
the
gentleman
known
as
granson
came
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
he
pronounced
her
nervous
system
to
be
in
a
decided
state
of
disorder
forwarded
some
soothing
draught
and
gave
orders
that
on
no
account
whatever
was
she
to
play
chess
again
the
next
morning
knight
much
vexed
with
himself
waited
with
a
curiously
compounded
feeling
for
her
entry
to
breakfast
the
women
servants
came
in
to
prayers
at
irregular
intervals
and
as
each
entered
he
could
not
to
save
his
life
avoid
turning
his
head
with
the
hope
that
she
might
be
elfride
swancourt
began
reading
without
waiting
for
her
then
somebody
glided
in
noiselessly
knight
softly
glanced
up
it
was
only
the
little
knight
thought
reading
prayers
a
bore
he
went
out
alone
and
for
almost
the
first
time
failed
to
recognize
that
holding
converse
with
nature
s
charms
was
not
solitude
on
nearing
the
house
again
he
perceived
his
young
friend
crossing
a
slope
by
a
path
which
ran
into
the
one
he
was
following
in
the
angle
of
the
field
here
they
met
elfride
was
at
once
exultant
and
abashed
coming
into
his
presence
had
upon
her
the
effect
of
entering
a
cathedral
knight
had
his
in
his
hand
and
had
in
fact
been
in
the
very
act
of
writing
therein
when
they
came
in
view
of
each
other
he
left
off
in
the
midst
of
a
sentence
and
proceeded
to
inquire
warmly
concerning
her
state
of
health
she
said
she
was
perfectly
well
and
indeed
had
never
looked
better
her
health
was
as
inconsequent
as
her
actions
her
lips
were
red
without
the
polish
that
cherries
have
and
their
redness
margined
with
the
white
skin
in
a
clearly
defined
line
which
had
nothing
of
jagged
confusion
in
it
altogether
she
stood
as
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
be
knocked
over
by
a
game
of
chess
because
too
to
play
one
are
you
taking
notes
she
inquired
with
an
alacrity
plainly
arising
less
from
interest
in
the
subject
than
from
a
wish
to
divert
his
thoughts
from
herself
yes
i
was
making
an
entry
and
with
your
permission
i
will
complete
knight
then
stood
still
and
wrote
elfride
remained
beside
him
a
moment
and
afterwards
walked
on
i
should
like
to
see
all
the
secrets
that
are
in
that
book
she
gaily
flung
back
to
him
over
her
shoulder
i
don
t
think
you
would
find
much
to
interest
i
know
i
then
of
course
i
have
no
more
to
but
i
would
ask
this
question
first
is
it
a
book
of
mere
facts
concerning
journeys
and
expenditure
and
so
on
or
a
book
of
thoughts
well
to
tell
the
truth
it
is
not
exactly
either
it
consists
for
the
most
part
of
jottings
for
articles
and
essays
disjointed
and
disconnected
of
no
possible
interest
to
anybody
but
it
contains
i
suppose
your
developed
thoughts
in
embryo
if
they
are
interesting
when
enlarged
to
the
size
of
an
article
what
must
they
be
in
their
concentrated
form
pure
rectified
spirit
above
proof
before
it
is
lowered
to
be
fit
for
human
consumption
words
that
burn
rather
like
a
balloon
before
it
is
inflated
flabby
shapeless
dead
you
could
hardly
read
may
i
try
she
said
coaxingly
i
wrote
my
poor
romance
in
that
way
i
mean
in
bits
out
of
doors
and
i
should
like
to
see
whether
your
way
of
entering
things
is
the
same
as
really
that
s
rather
an
awkward
request
i
suppose
i
can
hardly
refuse
now
you
have
asked
so
directly
but
you
think
me
in
asking
but
does
not
this
justify
me
your
writing
in
my
presence
knight
if
i
had
lighted
upon
your
book
by
chance
it
would
have
been
different
but
you
stand
before
me
and
say
excuse
me
without
caring
whether
i
do
or
not
and
write
on
and
then
tell
me
they
are
not
private
facts
but
public
very
well
miss
swancourt
if
you
really
must
see
the
consequences
be
upon
your
own
head
remember
my
advice
to
you
is
to
leave
my
book
but
with
that
caution
i
have
your
permission
she
hesitated
a
moment
looked
at
his
hand
containing
the
book
then
laughed
and
saying
i
must
see
it
withdrew
it
from
his
fingers
knight
rambled
on
towards
the
house
leaving
her
standing
in
the
path
turning
over
the
leaves
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
he
saw
that
she
had
moved
and
waited
till
she
came
up
elfride
had
closed
the
and
was
carrying
it
disdainfully
by
the
corner
between
her
finger
and
thumb
her
face
wore
a
nettled
look
she
silently
extended
the
volume
towards
him
raising
her
eyes
no
higher
than
her
hand
was
lifted
take
it
said
elfride
quickly
i
don
t
want
to
read
could
you
understand
it
said
knight
as
far
as
i
looked
but
i
didn
t
care
to
read
why
miss
swancourt
only
because
i
didn
t
wish
to
that
s
i
warned
you
that
you
might
yes
but
i
never
supposed
you
would
have
put
me
your
name
is
not
mentioned
once
within
the
four
not
my
name
i
know
nor
your
description
nor
anything
by
which
anybody
would
recognize
except
myself
for
what
is
this
she
exclaimed
taking
it
from
him
and
opening
a
page
august
that
s
the
day
before
yesterday
but
i
won
t
read
it
elfride
said
closing
the
book
again
with
pretty
hauteur
why
should
i
i
had
no
business
to
ask
to
see
your
book
and
it
serves
me
knight
hardly
recollected
what
he
had
written
and
turned
over
the
book
to
see
he
came
to
this
aug
girl
gets
into
her
teens
and
her
is
born
after
a
certain
interval
passed
in
infantine
helplessness
it
begins
to
act
simple
young
and
inexperienced
at
first
persons
of
observation
can
tell
to
a
nicety
how
old
this
consciousness
is
by
the
skill
it
has
acquired
in
the
art
necessary
to
its
success
the
art
of
hiding
itself
generally
begins
career
by
actions
which
are
popularly
termed
method
adopted
depends
in
each
case
upon
the
disposition
rank
residence
of
the
young
lady
attempting
it
girl
will
utter
some
moral
paradox
on
fast
men
or
love
country
miss
adopts
the
more
material
media
of
taking
a
ghastly
fence
whistling
or
making
your
blood
run
cold
by
appearing
to
risk
her
neck
mem
on
endelstow
tower
an
innocent
vanity
is
of
course
the
origin
of
these
displays
look
at
me
say
these
youthful
beginners
in
womanly
artifice
without
reflecting
whether
or
not
it
be
to
their
advantage
to
show
so
very
much
of
themselves
amplify
and
correct
for
paper
on
artless
arts
yes
i
remember
now
said
knight
the
notes
were
certainly
suggested
by
your
manoeuvre
on
the
church
tower
but
you
must
not
think
too
much
of
such
random
observations
he
continued
encouragingly
as
he
noticed
her
injured
looks
a
mere
fancy
passing
through
my
head
assumes
a
factitious
importance
to
you
because
it
has
been
made
permanent
by
being
written
down
all
mankind
think
thoughts
as
bad
as
those
of
people
they
most
love
on
earth
but
such
thoughts
never
getting
embodied
on
paper
it
becomes
assumed
that
they
never
existed
i
daresay
that
you
yourself
have
thought
some
disagreeable
thing
or
other
of
me
which
would
seem
just
as
bad
as
this
if
written
i
challenge
you
now
to
tell
the
worst
thing
i
have
thought
of
you
i
must
oh
i
thought
you
were
rather
knight
looked
slightly
redder
and
that
there
was
a
little
bald
spot
on
the
top
of
your
two
ineradicable
defects
said
knight
there
being
a
faint
ghastliness
discernible
in
his
laugh
they
are
much
worse
in
a
lady
s
eye
than
being
thought
i
ah
that
s
very
fine
she
said
too
inexperienced
to
perceive
her
hit
and
hence
not
quite
disposed
to
forgive
his
notes
you
alluded
to
me
in
that
entry
as
if
i
were
such
a
child
too
everybody
does
that
i
can
not
understand
it
i
am
quite
a
woman
you
know
how
old
do
you
think
i
am
how
old
why
seventeen
i
should
say
all
girls
are
you
are
wrong
i
am
nearly
nineteen
which
class
of
women
do
you
like
best
those
who
seem
younger
or
those
who
seem
older
than
they
are
i
should
be
inclined
to
say
those
who
seem
so
it
was
not
elfride
s
class
but
it
is
well
known
she
said
eagerly
and
there
was
something
touching
in
the
artless
anxiety
to
be
thought
much
of
which
she
revealed
by
her
words
that
the
slower
a
nature
is
to
develop
the
richer
the
nature
youths
and
girls
who
are
men
and
women
before
they
come
of
age
are
nobodies
by
the
time
that
backward
people
have
shown
their
full
yes
said
knight
thoughtfully
there
is
really
something
in
that
remark
but
at
the
risk
of
offence
i
must
remind
you
that
you
there
take
it
for
granted
that
the
woman
behind
her
time
at
a
given
age
has
not
reached
the
end
of
her
tether
her
backwardness
may
be
not
because
she
is
slow
to
develop
but
because
she
soon
exhausted
her
capacity
for
elfride
looked
disappointed
by
this
time
they
were
indoors
swancourt
to
whom
by
any
honest
means
was
meat
and
drink
had
now
a
little
scheme
of
that
nature
concerning
this
pair
the
in
which
they
both
expected
to
find
her
was
empty
the
old
lady
having
for
the
above
reason
vacated
it
by
the
second
door
as
they
entered
by
the
first
knight
went
to
the
and
carelessly
surveyed
two
portraits
on
ivory
though
these
pink
ladies
had
very
rudimentary
features
judging
by
what
i
see
here
he
observed
they
had
unquestionably
beautiful
heads
of
yes
and
that
is
everything
said
elfride
possibly
conscious
of
her
own
possibly
not
not
everything
though
a
great
deal
which
colour
do
you
like
best
she
ventured
to
ask
more
depends
on
its
abundance
than
on
its
abundances
being
equal
may
i
inquire
your
favourite
colour
i
mean
for
women
she
said
with
the
minutest
fall
of
countenance
and
a
hope
that
she
had
been
misunderstood
so
do
i
knight
replied
it
was
impossible
for
any
man
not
to
know
the
colour
of
elfride
s
hair
in
women
who
wear
it
plainly
such
a
feature
may
be
overlooked
by
men
not
given
to
ocular
intentness
but
hers
was
always
in
the
way
you
saw
her
hair
as
far
as
you
could
see
her
sex
and
knew
that
it
was
the
palest
brown
she
knew
instantly
that
knight
being
perfectly
aware
of
this
had
an
independent
standard
of
admiration
in
the
matter
elfride
was
thoroughly
vexed
she
could
not
but
be
struck
with
the
honesty
of
his
opinions
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
more
they
went
against
her
the
more
she
respected
them
and
now
like
a
reckless
gambler
she
hazarded
her
last
and
best
treasure
her
eyes
they
were
her
all
now
what
coloured
eyes
do
you
like
best
knight
she
said
slowly
honestly
or
as
a
compliment
of
course
honestly
i
don
t
want
anybody
s
compliment
and
yet
elfride
knew
otherwise
that
a
compliment
or
word
of
approval
from
that
man
then
would
have
been
like
a
well
to
a
famished
arab
i
prefer
hazel
he
said
serenely
she
had
played
and
lost
again
chapter
xix
love
was
in
the
next
knight
had
none
of
those
light
familiarities
of
speech
which
by
judicious
touches
of
epigrammatic
flattery
obliterate
a
woman
s
recollection
of
the
speaker
s
abstract
opinions
so
no
more
was
said
by
either
on
the
subject
of
hair
eyes
or
development
elfride
s
mind
had
been
impregnated
with
sentiments
of
her
own
smallness
to
an
uncomfortable
degree
of
distinctness
and
her
discomfort
was
visible
in
her
face
the
whole
tendency
of
the
conversation
latterly
had
been
to
quietly
but
surely
disparage
her
and
she
was
fain
to
take
stephen
into
favour
in
he
would
not
have
been
so
unloving
she
said
as
to
admire
an
idiosyncrasy
and
features
different
from
her
own
true
stephen
had
declared
he
loved
her
knight
had
never
done
anything
of
the
sort
somehow
this
did
not
mend
matters
and
the
sensation
of
her
smallness
in
knight
s
eyes
still
remained
had
the
position
been
reversed
had
stephen
loved
her
in
spite
of
a
differing
taste
and
had
knight
been
indifferent
in
spite
of
her
resemblance
to
his
ideal
it
would
have
engendered
far
happier
thoughts
as
matters
stood
stephen
s
admiration
might
have
its
root
in
a
blindness
the
result
of
passion
perhaps
any
keen
man
s
judgment
was
condemnatory
of
her
during
the
remainder
of
saturday
they
were
more
or
less
thrown
with
their
seniors
and
no
conversation
arose
which
was
exclusively
their
own
when
elfride
was
in
bed
that
night
her
thoughts
recurred
to
the
same
subject
at
one
moment
she
insisted
that
it
was
of
him
to
speak
so
decisively
as
he
had
done
the
next
that
it
was
sterling
honesty
ah
what
a
poor
nobody
i
am
she
said
sighing
people
like
him
who
go
about
the
great
world
don
t
care
in
the
least
what
i
am
like
either
in
mood
or
perhaps
a
man
who
has
got
thoroughly
into
a
woman
s
mind
in
this
manner
is
half
way
to
her
heart
the
distance
between
those
two
stations
is
proverbially
short
and
are
you
really
going
away
this
week
said
swancourt
to
knight
on
the
following
evening
which
was
sunday
they
were
all
leisurely
climbing
the
hill
to
the
church
where
a
last
service
was
now
to
be
held
at
the
rather
exceptional
time
of
evening
instead
of
in
the
afternoon
previous
to
the
demolition
of
the
ruinous
portions
i
am
intending
to
cross
to
cork
from
bristol
returned
knight
and
then
i
go
on
to
return
this
way
and
stay
a
little
longer
with
us
said
the
vicar
a
week
is
nothing
we
have
hardly
been
able
to
realize
your
presence
yet
i
remember
a
story
which
the
vicar
suddenly
stopped
he
had
forgotten
it
was
sunday
and
would
probably
have
gone
on
in
his
mode
of
thought
had
not
a
turn
in
the
breeze
blown
the
skirt
of
his
college
gown
within
the
range
of
his
vision
and
so
reminded
him
he
at
once
diverted
the
current
of
his
narrative
with
the
dexterity
the
occasion
demanded
the
story
of
the
levite
who
journeyed
to
from
which
i
took
my
text
the
sunday
before
last
is
quite
to
the
point
he
continued
with
the
pronunciation
of
a
man
who
far
from
having
intended
to
tell
a
story
a
moment
earlier
had
thought
of
nothing
but
sabbath
matters
for
several
weeks
what
did
he
gain
after
all
by
his
restlessness
had
he
remained
in
the
city
of
the
jebusites
and
not
been
so
anxious
for
gibeah
none
of
his
troubles
would
have
but
he
had
wasted
five
days
already
said
knight
closing
his
eyes
to
the
vicar
s
commendable
diversion
his
fault
lay
in
beginning
the
tarrying
system
true
true
my
illustration
but
not
the
hospitality
which
prompted
the
so
you
are
to
come
just
the
same
urged
swancourt
for
she
had
seen
an
almost
imperceptible
fall
of
countenance
in
her
stepdaughter
at
knight
s
announcement
knight
half
promised
to
call
on
his
return
journey
but
the
uncertainty
with
which
he
spoke
was
quite
enough
to
fill
elfride
with
a
regretful
interest
in
all
he
did
during
the
few
remaining
hours
the
curate
having
already
officiated
twice
that
day
in
the
two
churches
swancourt
had
undertaken
the
whole
of
the
evening
service
and
knight
read
the
lessons
for
him
the
sun
streamed
across
from
the
dilapidated
west
window
and
lighted
all
the
assembled
worshippers
with
a
golden
glow
knight
as
he
read
being
illuminated
by
the
same
mellow
lustre
elfride
at
the
organ
regarded
him
with
a
throbbing
sadness
of
mood
which
was
fed
by
a
sense
of
being
far
removed
from
his
sphere
as
he
went
deliberately
through
the
chapter
appointed
a
portion
of
the
history
of
elijah
and
ascended
that
magnificent
climax
of
the
wind
the
earthquake
the
fire
and
the
still
small
voice
his
deep
tones
echoed
past
with
such
apparent
disregard
of
her
existence
that
his
presence
inspired
her
with
a
forlorn
sense
of
unapproachableness
which
his
absence
would
hardly
have
been
able
to
cause
at
the
same
time
turning
her
face
for
a
moment
to
catch
the
glory
of
the
dying
sun
as
it
fell
on
his
form
her
eyes
were
arrested
by
the
shape
and
aspect
of
a
woman
in
the
west
gallery
it
was
the
bleak
barren
countenance
of
the
widow
jethway
whom
elfride
had
not
seen
much
of
since
the
morning
of
her
return
with
stephen
smith
possessing
the
smallest
of
competencies
this
unhappy
woman
appeared
to
spend
her
life
in
journeyings
between
endelstow
churchyard
and
that
of
a
village
near
southampton
where
her
father
and
mother
were
laid
she
had
not
attended
the
service
here
for
a
considerable
time
and
she
now
seemed
to
have
a
reason
for
her
choice
of
seat
from
the
gallery
window
the
tomb
of
her
son
was
plainly
visible
standing
as
the
nearest
object
in
a
prospect
which
was
closed
outwardly
by
the
changeless
horizon
of
the
sea
the
streaming
rays
too
flooded
her
face
now
bent
towards
elfride
with
a
hard
and
bitter
expression
that
the
solemnity
of
the
place
raised
to
a
tragic
dignity
it
did
not
intrinsically
possess
the
girl
resumed
her
normal
attitude
with
an
added
disquiet
elfride
s
emotion
was
cumulative
and
after
a
while
would
assert
itself
on
a
sudden
a
slight
touch
was
enough
to
set
it
free
a
poem
a
sunset
a
cunningly
contrived
chord
of
music
a
vague
imagining
being
the
usual
accidents
of
its
exhibition
the
longing
for
knight
s
respect
which
was
leading
up
to
an
incipient
yearning
for
his
love
made
the
present
conjuncture
a
sufficient
one
whilst
kneeling
down
previous
to
leaving
when
the
sunny
streaks
had
gone
upward
to
the
roof
and
the
lower
part
of
the
church
was
in
soft
shadow
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
coleridge
s
morbid
poem
the
three
graves
and
shuddering
as
she
wondered
if
jethway
were
cursing
her
she
wept
as
if
her
heart
would
break
they
came
out
of
church
just
as
the
sun
went
down
leaving
the
landscape
like
a
platform
from
which
an
eloquent
speaker
has
retired
and
nothing
remains
for
the
audience
to
do
but
to
rise
and
go
home
and
swancourt
went
off
in
the
carriage
knight
and
elfride
preferring
to
walk
as
the
skilful
old
matchmaker
had
imagined
they
descended
the
hill
together
i
liked
your
reading
knight
elfride
presently
found
herself
saying
you
read
better
than
i
will
praise
anybody
that
will
praise
me
you
played
excellently
miss
swancourt
and
very
correctly
it
must
be
a
great
pleasure
to
you
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
i
want
to
be
able
to
play
with
more
feeling
but
i
have
not
a
good
selection
of
music
sacred
or
secular
i
wish
i
had
a
nice
little
well
chosen
and
that
the
only
new
pieces
sent
me
were
those
of
genuine
i
am
glad
to
hear
such
a
wish
from
you
it
is
extraordinary
how
many
women
have
no
honest
love
of
music
as
an
end
and
not
as
a
means
even
leaving
out
those
who
have
nothing
in
them
they
mostly
like
it
for
its
accessories
i
have
never
met
a
woman
who
loves
music
as
do
ten
or
a
dozen
men
i
how
would
you
draw
the
line
between
women
with
something
and
women
with
nothing
in
them
well
said
knight
reflecting
a
moment
i
mean
by
nothing
in
them
those
who
don
t
care
about
anything
solid
this
is
an
instance
i
knew
a
man
who
had
a
young
friend
in
whom
he
was
much
interested
in
fact
they
were
going
to
be
married
she
was
seemingly
poetical
and
he
offered
her
a
choice
of
two
editions
of
the
british
poets
which
she
pretended
to
want
badly
he
said
which
of
them
would
you
like
best
for
me
to
send
she
said
a
pair
of
the
prettiest
earrings
in
bond
street
if
you
don
t
mind
would
be
nicer
than
now
i
call
her
a
girl
with
not
much
in
her
but
vanity
and
so
do
you
i
oh
yes
replied
elfride
with
an
effort
happening
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
face
as
she
was
speaking
and
noticing
that
her
attempt
at
heartiness
was
a
miserable
failure
he
appeared
to
have
misgivings
you
miss
swancourt
would
not
under
such
circumstances
have
preferred
the
nicknacks
no
i
don
t
think
i
should
indeed
she
stammered
i
ll
put
it
to
you
said
the
inflexible
knight
which
will
you
have
of
these
two
things
of
about
equal
value
the
little
library
of
the
best
music
you
spoke
of
bound
in
morocco
walnut
case
lock
and
key
or
a
pair
of
the
very
prettiest
earrings
in
bond
street
windows
of
course
the
music
elfride
replied
with
forced
earnestness
you
are
quite
certain
he
said
emphatically
quite
she
faltered
if
i
could
for
certain
buy
the
earrings
knight
somewhat
blamably
keenly
enjoyed
sparring
with
the
palpitating
mobile
creature
whose
excitable
nature
made
any
such
thing
a
species
of
cruelty
he
looked
at
her
rather
oddly
and
said
fie
forgive
me
she
said
laughing
a
little
a
little
frightened
and
blushing
very
deeply
ah
miss
elfie
why
didn
t
you
say
at
first
as
any
firm
woman
would
have
said
i
am
as
bad
as
she
and
shall
choose
the
same
i
don
t
know
said
elfride
wofully
and
with
a
distressful
smile
i
thought
you
were
exceptionally
musical
so
i
am
i
think
but
the
test
is
so
severe
quite
i
don
t
music
doesn
t
do
any
real
good
or
rather
that
is
a
thing
to
say
miss
swancourt
why
what
you
don
t
understand
you
don
t
understand
why
what
conceivable
use
is
there
in
jimcrack
jewellery
no
no
no
no
she
cried
petulantly
i
didn
t
mean
what
you
think
i
like
the
music
best
only
i
like
earrings
better
own
it
he
said
in
a
teasing
tone
well
i
think
i
should
have
had
the
moral
courage
to
own
it
at
once
without
pretending
to
an
elevation
i
could
not
like
the
french
soldiery
elfride
was
not
brave
when
on
the
defensive
so
it
was
almost
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
she
answered
desperately
my
meaning
is
that
i
like
earrings
best
just
now
because
i
lost
one
of
my
prettiest
pair
last
year
and
papa
said
he
would
not
buy
any
more
or
allow
me
to
myself
because
i
was
careless
and
now
i
wish
i
had
some
like
them
that
s
what
my
meaning
is
indeed
it
is
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
very
harsh
and
rude
said
knight
with
a
look
of
regret
at
seeing
how
disturbed
she
was
but
seriously
if
women
only
knew
how
they
ruin
their
good
looks
by
such
appurtenances
i
am
sure
they
would
never
want
they
were
lovely
and
became
me
so
not
if
they
were
like
the
ordinary
hideous
things
women
stuff
their
ears
with
nowadays
like
the
governor
of
a
or
a
pair
of
scales
or
gold
gibbets
and
chains
and
artists
palettes
and
compensation
pendulums
and
heaven
knows
what
no
they
were
not
one
of
those
things
so
pretty
like
this
she
said
with
eager
animation
and
she
drew
with
the
point
of
her
parasol
an
enlarged
view
of
one
of
the
lamented
darlings
to
a
scale
that
would
have
suited
a
giantess
high
yes
very
pretty
very
said
knight
dryly
how
did
you
come
to
lose
such
a
precious
pair
of
articles
i
only
lost
one
nobody
ever
loses
both
at
the
same
she
made
this
remark
with
embarrassment
and
a
nervous
movement
of
the
fingers
seeing
that
the
loss
occurred
whilst
stephen
smith
was
attempting
to
kiss
her
for
the
first
time
on
the
cliff
her
confusion
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
the
question
had
been
awkward
and
received
no
direct
answer
knight
seemed
not
to
notice
her
manner
oh
nobody
ever
loses
both
i
see
and
certainly
the
fact
that
it
was
a
case
of
loss
takes
away
all
odour
of
vanity
from
your
as
i
never
know
whether
you
are
in
earnest
i
don
t
now
she
said
looking
up
inquiringly
at
the
hairy
face
of
the
oracle
and
coming
gallantly
to
her
own
rescue
if
i
really
seem
vain
it
is
that
i
am
only
vain
in
my
ways
not
in
my
heart
the
worst
women
are
those
vain
in
their
hearts
and
not
in
their
an
adroit
distinction
well
they
are
certainly
the
more
objectionable
of
the
two
said
knight
is
vanity
a
mortal
or
a
venial
sin
you
know
what
life
is
tell
i
am
very
far
from
knowing
what
life
is
a
just
conception
of
life
is
too
large
a
thing
to
grasp
during
the
short
interval
of
passing
through
will
the
fact
of
a
woman
being
fond
of
jewellery
be
likely
to
make
her
life
in
its
higher
sense
a
failure
nobody
s
life
is
altogether
a
well
you
know
what
i
mean
even
though
my
words
are
badly
selected
and
commonplace
she
said
impatiently
because
i
utter
commonplace
words
you
must
not
suppose
i
think
only
commonplace
thoughts
my
poor
stock
of
words
are
like
a
limited
number
of
rough
moulds
i
have
to
cast
all
my
materials
in
good
and
bad
and
the
novelty
or
delicacy
of
the
substance
is
often
lost
in
the
coarse
triteness
of
the
very
well
i
ll
believe
that
ingenious
representation
as
to
the
subject
in
hand
lives
which
are
failures
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
anybody
s
life
may
be
just
as
romantic
and
strange
and
interesting
if
he
or
she
fails
as
if
he
or
she
succeed
all
the
difference
is
that
the
last
chapter
is
wanting
in
the
story
if
a
man
of
power
tries
to
do
a
great
deed
and
just
falls
short
of
it
by
an
accident
not
his
fault
up
to
that
time
his
history
had
as
much
in
it
as
that
of
a
great
man
who
has
done
his
great
deed
it
is
whimsical
of
the
world
to
hold
that
particulars
of
how
a
lad
went
to
school
and
so
on
should
be
as
an
interesting
romance
or
as
nothing
to
them
precisely
in
proportion
to
his
after
they
were
walking
between
the
sunset
and
the
moonrise
with
the
dropping
of
the
sun
a
nearly
full
moon
had
begun
to
raise
itself
their
shadows
as
cast
by
the
western
glare
showed
signs
of
becoming
obliterated
in
the
interest
of
a
rival
pair
in
the
opposite
direction
which
the
moon
was
bringing
to
distinctness
i
consider
my
life
to
some
extent
a
failure
said
knight
again
after
a
pause
during
which
he
had
noticed
the
antagonistic
shadows
you
how
i
don
t
precisely
know
but
in
some
way
i
have
missed
the
really
to
have
done
it
is
not
much
to
be
sad
about
but
to
feel
that
you
have
done
it
must
be
a
cause
of
sorrow
am
i
right
partly
though
not
quite
for
a
sensation
of
being
profoundly
experienced
serves
as
a
sort
of
consolation
to
people
who
are
conscious
of
having
taken
wrong
turnings
contradictory
as
it
seems
there
is
nothing
truer
than
that
people
who
have
always
gone
right
don
t
know
half
as
much
about
the
nature
and
ways
of
going
right
as
those
do
who
have
gone
wrong
however
it
is
not
desirable
for
me
to
chill
your
by
going
into
you
have
not
told
me
even
now
if
i
am
really
if
i
say
yes
i
shall
offend
you
if
i
say
no
you
ll
think
i
don
t
mean
it
he
replied
looking
curiously
into
her
face
ah
well
she
replied
with
a
little
breath
of
distress
that
which
is
exceeding
deep
who
will
find
it
out
i
suppose
i
must
take
you
as
i
do
the
bible
find
out
and
understand
all
i
can
and
on
the
strength
of
that
swallow
the
rest
in
a
lump
by
simple
faith
think
me
vain
if
you
will
worldly
greatness
requires
so
much
littleness
to
grow
up
in
that
an
infirmity
more
or
less
is
not
a
matter
for
as
regards
women
i
can
t
say
answered
knight
carelessly
but
it
is
without
doubt
a
misfortune
for
a
man
who
has
a
living
to
get
to
be
born
of
a
truly
noble
nature
a
high
soul
will
bring
a
man
to
the
workhouse
so
you
may
be
right
in
sticking
up
for
no
no
i
don
t
do
that
she
said
regretfully
knight
when
you
are
gone
will
you
send
me
something
you
have
written
i
think
i
should
like
to
see
whether
you
write
as
you
have
lately
spoken
or
in
your
better
mood
which
is
your
true
self
the
cynic
you
have
been
this
evening
or
the
nice
philosopher
you
were
up
to
ah
which
you
know
as
well
as
their
conversation
detained
them
on
the
lawn
and
in
the
portico
till
the
stars
blinked
out
elfride
flung
back
her
head
and
said
idly
there
s
a
bright
star
exactly
over
each
bright
star
is
overhead
is
it
oh
yes
of
course
where
is
that
one
and
she
pointed
with
her
finger
that
is
poised
like
a
white
hawk
over
one
of
the
cape
verde
and
that
looking
down
upon
the
source
of
the
and
that
lonely
one
he
watches
the
north
pole
and
has
no
less
than
the
whole
equator
for
his
horizon
and
that
idle
one
low
down
upon
the
ground
that
we
have
almost
rolled
away
from
is
in
india
over
the
head
of
a
young
friend
of
mine
who
very
possibly
looks
at
the
star
in
our
zenith
as
it
hangs
low
upon
his
horizon
and
thinks
of
it
as
marking
where
his
true
love
elfride
glanced
at
knight
with
misgiving
did
he
mean
her
she
could
not
see
his
features
but
his
attitude
seemed
to
show
unconsciousness
the
star
is
over
my
head
she
said
with
hesitation
or
anybody
else
s
in
oh
yes
i
see
she
breathed
her
relief
his
parents
i
believe
are
natives
of
this
county
i
don
t
know
them
though
i
have
been
in
correspondence
with
him
for
many
years
till
lately
fortunately
or
unfortunately
for
him
he
fell
in
love
and
then
went
to
bombay
since
that
time
i
have
heard
very
little
of
knight
went
no
further
in
his
volunteered
statement
and
though
elfride
at
one
moment
was
inclined
to
profit
by
the
lessons
in
honesty
he
had
just
been
giving
her
the
flesh
was
weak
and
the
intention
dispersed
into
silence
there
seemed
a
reproach
in
knight
s
blind
words
and
yet
she
was
not
able
to
clearly
define
any
disloyalty
that
she
had
been
guilty
of
chapter
xx
a
distant
dearness
in
the
knight
turned
his
back
upon
the
parish
of
endelstow
and
crossed
over
to
cork
one
day
of
absence
superimposed
itself
on
another
and
proportionately
weighted
his
heart
he
pushed
on
to
the
lakes
of
killarney
rambled
amid
their
luxuriant
woods
surveyed
the
infinite
variety
of
island
hill
and
dale
there
to
be
found
listened
to
the
marvellous
echoes
of
that
romantic
spot
but
altogether
missed
the
glory
and
the
dream
he
formerly
found
in
such
favoured
regions
whilst
in
the
company
of
elfride
her
girlish
presence
had
not
perceptibly
affected
him
to
any
depth
he
had
not
been
conscious
that
her
entry
into
his
sphere
had
added
anything
to
himself
but
now
that
she
was
taken
away
he
was
very
conscious
of
a
great
deal
being
abstracted
the
superfluity
had
become
a
necessity
and
knight
was
in
love
stephen
fell
in
love
with
elfride
by
looking
at
her
knight
by
ceasing
to
do
so
when
or
how
the
spirit
entered
into
him
he
knew
not
certain
he
was
that
when
on
the
point
of
leaving
endelstow
he
had
felt
none
of
that
exquisite
nicety
of
poignant
sadness
natural
to
such
severances
seeing
how
delightful
a
subject
of
contemplation
elfride
had
been
ever
since
had
he
begun
to
love
her
when
she
met
his
eye
after
her
mishap
on
the
tower
he
had
simply
thought
her
weak
had
he
grown
to
love
her
whilst
standing
on
the
lawn
brightened
all
over
by
the
evening
sun
he
had
thought
her
complexion
good
no
more
was
it
her
conversation
that
had
sown
the
seed
he
had
thought
her
words
ingenious
and
very
creditable
to
a
young
woman
but
not
noteworthy
had
the
anything
to
do
with
it
certainly
not
he
had
thought
her
at
that
time
a
rather
conceited
child
knight
s
experience
was
a
complete
disproof
of
the
assumption
that
love
always
comes
by
glances
of
the
eye
and
sympathetic
touches
of
the
fingers
that
like
flame
it
makes
itself
palpable
at
the
moment
of
generation
not
till
they
were
parted
and
she
had
become
sublimated
in
his
memory
could
he
be
said
to
have
even
attentively
regarded
her
thus
having
passively
gathered
up
images
of
her
which
his
mind
did
not
act
upon
till
the
cause
of
them
was
no
longer
before
him
he
appeared
to
himself
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
soul
which
had
temporarily
assumed
its
disembodiment
to
accompany
him
on
his
way
she
began
to
rule
him
so
imperiously
now
that
accustomed
to
analysis
he
almost
trembled
at
the
possible
result
of
the
introduction
of
this
new
force
among
the
nicely
adjusted
ones
of
his
ordinary
life
he
became
restless
then
he
forgot
all
collateral
subjects
in
the
pleasure
of
thinking
about
her
yet
it
must
be
said
that
knight
loved
philosophically
rather
than
with
romance
he
thought
of
her
manner
towards
him
simplicity
verges
on
coquetry
was
she
flirting
he
said
to
himself
no
forcible
translation
of
favour
into
suspicion
was
able
to
uphold
such
a
theory
the
performance
had
been
too
well
done
to
be
anything
but
real
it
had
the
defects
without
which
nothing
is
genuine
no
actress
of
twenty
years
standing
no
lady
whose
earliest
season
out
was
lost
in
the
discreet
mist
of
evasive
talk
could
have
played
before
him
the
part
of
ingenuous
girl
as
elfride
lived
it
she
had
the
little
artful
ways
which
partly
make
up
ingenuousness
there
are
bachelors
by
nature
and
bachelors
by
circumstance
spinsters
there
doubtless
are
also
of
both
kinds
though
some
think
only
those
of
the
latter
however
knight
had
been
looked
upon
as
a
bachelor
by
nature
what
was
he
coming
to
it
was
very
odd
to
himself
to
look
at
his
theories
on
the
subject
of
love
and
reading
them
now
by
the
full
light
of
a
new
experience
to
see
how
much
more
his
sentences
meant
than
he
had
felt
them
to
mean
when
they
were
written
people
often
discover
the
real
force
of
a
trite
old
maxim
only
when
it
is
thrust
upon
them
by
a
chance
adventure
but
knight
had
never
before
known
the
case
of
a
man
who
learnt
the
full
compass
of
his
own
epigrams
by
such
means
he
was
intensely
satisfied
with
one
aspect
of
the
affair
inbred
in
him
was
an
invincible
objection
to
be
any
but
the
first
comer
in
a
woman
s
heart
he
had
discovered
within
himself
the
condition
that
if
ever
he
did
make
up
his
mind
to
marry
it
must
be
on
the
certainty
that
no
cropping
out
of
inconvenient
old
letters
no
bow
and
blush
to
a
mysterious
stranger
casually
met
should
be
a
possible
source
of
discomposure
knight
s
sentiments
were
only
the
ordinary
ones
of
a
man
of
his
age
who
loves
genuinely
perhaps
exaggerated
a
little
by
his
pursuits
when
men
first
love
as
lads
it
is
with
the
very
centre
of
their
hearts
nothing
else
being
concerned
in
the
operation
with
added
years
more
of
the
faculties
attempt
a
partnership
in
the
passion
till
at
knight
s
age
the
understanding
is
fain
to
have
a
hand
in
it
it
may
as
well
be
left
out
a
man
in
love
setting
up
his
brains
as
a
gauge
of
his
position
is
as
one
determining
a
ship
s
longitude
from
a
light
at
the
knight
argued
from
elfride
s
unwontedness
of
manner
which
was
matter
of
fact
to
an
unwontedness
in
love
which
was
matter
of
inference
only
incredules
les
plus
credules
elfride
he
said
had
hardly
looked
upon
a
man
till
she
saw
he
had
never
forgotten
his
severity
to
her
because
she
preferred
ornament
to
edification
and
had
since
excused
her
a
hundred
times
by
thinking
how
natural
to
womankind
was
a
love
of
adornment
and
how
necessary
became
a
mild
infusion
of
personal
vanity
to
complete
the
delicate
and
fascinating
dye
of
the
feminine
mind
so
at
the
end
of
the
week
s
absence
which
had
brought
him
as
far
as
dublin
he
resolved
to
curtail
his
tour
return
to
endelstow
and
commit
himself
by
making
a
reality
of
the
hypothetical
offer
of
that
sunday
evening
notwithstanding
that
he
had
concocted
a
great
deal
of
paper
theory
on
social
amenities
and
modern
manners
generally
the
special
ounce
of
practice
was
wanting
and
now
for
his
life
knight
could
not
recollect
whether
it
was
considered
correct
to
give
a
young
lady
personal
ornaments
before
a
regular
engagement
to
marry
had
been
initiated
but
the
day
before
leaving
dublin
he
looked
around
anxiously
for
a
jewellery
establishment
in
which
he
purchased
what
he
considered
would
suit
her
best
it
was
with
a
most
awkward
and
unwonted
feeling
that
after
entering
and
closing
the
door
of
his
room
he
sat
down
opened
the
morocco
case
and
held
up
each
of
the
fragile
bits
of
before
his
eyes
many
things
had
become
old
to
the
solitary
man
of
letters
but
these
were
new
and
he
handled
like
a
child
an
outcome
of
civilization
which
had
never
before
been
touched
by
his
fingers
a
sudden
fastidious
decision
that
the
pattern
chosen
would
not
suit
her
after
all
caused
him
to
rise
in
a
flurry
and
tear
down
the
street
to
change
them
for
others
after
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
reselecting
during
which
his
mind
became
so
bewildered
that
the
critical
faculty
on
objects
of
art
seemed
to
have
vacated
his
person
altogether
knight
carried
off
another
pair
of
these
remained
in
his
possession
till
the
afternoon
when
after
contemplating
them
fifty
times
with
a
growing
misgiving
that
the
last
choice
was
worse
than
the
first
he
felt
that
no
sleep
would
visit
his
pillow
till
he
had
improved
upon
his
previous
purchases
yet
again
in
a
perfect
heat
of
vexation
with
himself
for
such
tergiversation
he
went
anew
to
the
was
absolutely
ashamed
to
enter
and
give
further
trouble
went
to
another
shop
bought
a
pair
at
an
enormously
increased
price
because
they
seemed
the
very
thing
asked
the
goldsmiths
if
they
would
take
the
other
pair
in
exchange
was
told
that
they
could
not
exchange
articles
bought
of
another
maker
paid
down
the
money
and
went
off
with
the
two
pairs
in
his
possession
wondering
what
on
earth
to
do
with
the
superfluous
pair
he
almost
wished
he
could
lose
them
or
that
somebody
would
steal
them
and
was
burdened
with
an
interposing
sense
that
as
a
capable
man
with
true
ideas
of
economy
he
must
necessarily
sell
them
somewhere
which
he
did
at
last
for
a
mere
song
mingled
with
a
blank
feeling
of
a
whole
day
being
lost
to
him
in
running
about
the
city
on
this
new
and
extraordinary
class
of
errand
and
of
several
pounds
being
lost
through
his
bungling
was
a
slight
sense
of
satisfaction
that
he
had
emerged
for
ever
from
his
antediluvian
ignorance
on
the
subject
of
ladies
jewellery
as
well
as
secured
a
truly
artistic
production
at
last
during
the
remainder
of
that
day
he
scanned
the
ornaments
of
every
lady
he
met
with
the
profoundly
experienced
eye
of
an
appraiser
next
morning
knight
was
again
crossing
george
s
channel
not
returning
to
london
by
the
holyhead
route
as
he
had
originally
intended
but
towards
bristol
availing
himself
of
and
swancourt
s
invitation
to
revisit
them
on
his
homeward
journey
we
flit
forward
to
elfride
woman
s
ruling
passion
to
fascinate
and
influence
those
more
powerful
than
she
though
operant
in
elfride
was
decidedly
purposeless
she
had
wanted
her
friend
knight
s
good
opinion
from
the
first
how
much
more
than
that
elementary
ingredient
of
friendship
she
now
desired
her
fears
would
hardly
allow
her
to
think
in
originally
wishing
to
please
the
highest
class
of
man
she
had
ever
intimately
known
there
was
no
disloyalty
to
stephen
smith
she
could
not
and
few
women
can
realize
the
possible
vastness
of
an
issue
which
has
only
an
insignificant
begetting
her
letters
from
stephen
were
necessarily
few
and
her
sense
of
fidelity
clung
to
the
last
she
had
received
as
a
wrecked
mariner
clings
to
flotsam
the
young
girl
persuaded
herself
that
she
was
glad
stephen
had
such
a
right
to
her
hand
as
he
had
acquired
in
her
eyes
by
the
elopement
she
beguiled
herself
by
saying
perhaps
if
i
had
not
so
committed
myself
i
might
fall
in
love
with
all
this
made
the
week
of
knight
s
absence
very
gloomy
and
distasteful
to
her
she
retained
stephen
in
her
prayers
and
his
old
letters
were
as
a
medicine
in
reality
though
she
deceived
herself
into
the
belief
that
it
was
as
a
pleasure
these
letters
had
grown
more
and
more
hopeful
he
told
her
that
he
finished
his
work
every
day
with
a
pleasant
consciousness
of
having
removed
one
more
stone
from
the
barrier
which
divided
them
then
he
drew
images
of
what
a
fine
figure
they
two
would
cut
some
day
people
would
turn
their
heads
and
say
what
a
prize
he
has
won
she
was
not
to
be
sad
about
that
wild
runaway
attempt
of
theirs
elfride
had
repeatedly
said
that
it
grieved
her
whatever
any
other
person
who
knew
of
it
might
think
he
knew
well
enough
the
modesty
of
her
nature
the
only
reproach
was
a
gentle
one
for
not
having
written
quite
so
devotedly
during
her
visit
to
london
her
letter
had
seemed
to
have
a
liveliness
derived
from
other
thoughts
than
thoughts
of
him
knight
s
intention
of
an
early
return
to
endelstow
having
originally
been
faint
his
promise
to
do
so
had
been
fainter
he
was
a
man
who
kept
his
words
well
to
the
rear
of
his
possible
actions
the
vicar
was
rather
surprised
to
see
him
again
so
soon
swancourt
was
not
knight
found
on
meeting
them
all
after
his
arrival
had
been
announced
that
they
had
formed
an
intention
to
go
to
leonards
for
a
few
days
at
the
end
of
the
month
no
satisfactory
conjuncture
offered
itself
on
this
first
evening
of
his
return
for
presenting
elfride
with
what
he
had
been
at
such
pains
to
procure
he
was
fastidious
in
his
reading
of
opportunities
for
such
an
intended
act
the
next
morning
chancing
to
break
fine
after
a
week
of
cloudy
weather
it
was
proposed
and
decided
that
they
should
all
drive
to
barwith
strand
a
local
lion
which
neither
swancourt
nor
knight
had
seen
knight
scented
romantic
occasions
from
afar
and
foresaw
that
such
a
one
might
be
expected
before
the
coming
night
the
journey
was
along
a
road
by
neutral
green
hills
upon
which
hedgerows
lay
trailing
like
ropes
on
a
quay
gaps
in
these
uplands
revealed
the
blue
sea
flecked
with
a
few
dashes
of
white
and
a
solitary
white
sail
the
whole
brimming
up
to
a
keen
horizon
which
lay
like
a
line
ruled
from
hillside
to
hillside
then
they
rolled
down
a
pass
the
rocks
forming
a
wall
on
both
sides
from
one
of
which
fell
a
heavy
jagged
shade
over
half
the
roadway
a
spout
of
fresh
water
burst
from
an
occasional
crevice
and
pattering
down
upon
broad
green
leaves
ran
along
as
a
rivulet
at
the
bottom
unkempt
locks
of
heather
overhung
the
brow
of
each
steep
whence
at
divers
points
a
bramble
swung
forth
into
snatching
at
their
like
a
claw
they
mounted
the
last
crest
and
the
bay
which
was
to
be
the
end
of
their
pilgrimage
burst
upon
them
the
ocean
blueness
deepened
its
colour
as
it
stretched
to
the
foot
of
the
crags
where
it
terminated
in
a
fringe
of
white
silent
at
this
distance
though
moving
and
heaving
like
a
counterpane
upon
a
restless
sleeper
the
shadowed
hollows
of
the
purple
and
brown
rocks
would
have
been
called
blue
had
not
that
tint
been
so
entirely
appropriated
by
the
water
beside
them
the
carriage
was
put
up
at
a
little
cottage
with
a
shed
attached
and
an
ostler
and
the
coachman
carried
the
hamper
of
provisions
down
to
the
shore
knight
found
his
opportunity
i
did
not
forget
your
wish
he
began
when
they
were
apart
from
their
friends
elfride
looked
as
if
she
did
not
understand
and
i
have
brought
you
these
he
continued
awkwardly
pulling
out
the
case
and
opening
it
while
holding
it
towards
her
o
knight
said
elfride
confusedly
and
turning
to
a
lively
red
i
didn
t
know
you
had
any
intention
or
meaning
in
what
you
said
i
thought
it
a
mere
supposition
i
don
t
want
a
thought
which
had
flashed
into
her
mind
gave
the
reply
a
greater
decisiveness
than
it
might
otherwise
have
possessed
was
the
day
for
stephen
s
letter
but
will
you
not
accept
them
knight
returned
feeling
less
her
master
than
heretofore
i
would
rather
not
they
are
beautiful
more
beautiful
than
any
i
have
ever
seen
she
answered
earnestly
looking
at
the
temptation
as
eve
may
have
looked
at
the
apple
but
i
don
t
want
to
have
them
if
you
will
kindly
forgive
me
no
kindness
at
all
said
knight
brought
to
a
full
stop
at
this
unexpected
turn
of
events
a
silence
followed
knight
held
the
open
case
looking
rather
wofully
at
the
glittering
forms
he
had
forsaken
his
orbit
to
procure
turning
it
about
and
holding
it
up
as
if
feeling
his
gift
to
be
slighted
by
her
he
were
endeavouring
to
admire
it
very
much
himself
shut
them
up
and
don
t
let
me
see
them
any
longer
do
she
said
laughingly
and
with
a
quaint
mixture
of
reluctance
and
entreaty
why
elfie
not
elfie
to
you
knight
oh
because
i
shall
want
them
there
i
am
silly
i
know
to
say
that
but
i
have
a
reason
for
not
taking
them
she
kept
in
the
last
word
for
a
moment
intending
to
imply
that
her
refusal
was
finite
but
somehow
the
word
slipped
out
and
undid
all
the
rest
you
will
take
them
some
day
i
don
t
want
why
don
t
you
want
to
elfride
swancourt
because
i
don
t
i
don
t
like
to
take
i
have
read
a
fact
of
distressing
significance
in
that
said
knight
since
you
like
them
your
dislike
to
having
them
must
be
towards
me
no
it
isn
what
then
do
you
like
me
elfride
deepened
in
tint
and
looked
into
the
distance
with
features
shaped
to
an
expression
of
the
nicest
criticism
as
regarded
her
answer
i
like
you
pretty
well
she
at
length
murmured
mildly
not
very
much
you
are
so
sharp
with
me
and
say
hard
things
and
so
how
can
i
she
replied
evasively
you
think
me
a
fogey
i
suppose
no
i
don
t
i
mean
i
do
i
don
t
know
what
i
think
you
i
mean
let
us
go
to
papa
responded
elfride
with
somewhat
of
a
flurried
delivery
well
i
ll
tell
you
my
object
in
getting
the
present
said
knight
with
a
composure
intended
to
remove
from
her
mind
any
possible
impression
of
his
being
what
he
was
her
lover
you
see
it
was
the
very
least
i
could
do
in
common
elfride
felt
rather
blank
at
this
lucid
statement
knight
continued
putting
away
the
case
i
felt
as
anybody
naturally
would
have
you
know
that
my
words
on
your
choice
the
other
day
were
invidious
and
unfair
and
thought
an
apology
should
take
a
practical
oh
elfride
was
sorry
she
could
not
tell
why
that
he
gave
such
a
legitimate
reason
it
was
a
disappointment
that
he
had
all
the
time
a
cool
motive
which
might
be
stated
to
anybody
without
raising
a
smile
had
she
known
they
were
offered
in
that
spirit
she
would
certainly
have
accepted
the
seductive
gift
and
the
tantalizing
feature
was
that
perhaps
he
suspected
her
to
imagine
them
offered
as
a
lover
s
token
which
was
mortifying
enough
if
they
were
not
swancourt
came
now
to
where
they
were
sitting
to
select
a
flat
boulder
for
spreading
their
upon
and
amid
the
discussion
on
that
subject
the
matter
pending
between
knight
and
elfride
was
shelved
for
a
while
he
read
her
refusal
so
certainly
as
the
bashfulness
of
a
girl
in
a
novel
position
that
upon
the
whole
he
could
tolerate
such
a
beginning
could
knight
have
been
told
that
it
was
a
sense
of
fidelity
struggling
against
new
love
whilst
no
less
assuring
as
to
his
ultimate
victory
it
might
have
entirely
abstracted
the
wish
to
secure
it
at
the
same
time
a
slight
constraint
of
manner
was
visible
between
them
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
the
tide
turned
and
they
were
obliged
to
ascend
to
higher
ground
the
day
glided
on
to
its
end
with
the
usual
quiet
dreamy
passivity
of
such
occasions
when
every
deed
done
and
thing
thought
is
in
endeavouring
to
avoid
doing
and
thinking
more
looking
idly
over
the
verge
of
a
crag
they
beheld
their
stone
gradually
being
splashed
upon
and
their
crumbs
and
fragments
all
washed
away
by
the
incoming
sea
the
vicar
drew
a
moral
lesson
from
the
scene
knight
replied
in
the
same
satisfied
strain
and
then
the
waves
rolled
in
furiously
the
neutral
tongues
of
water
slid
up
the
slopes
and
were
metamorphosed
into
foam
by
a
careless
blow
falling
back
white
and
faint
and
leaving
trailing
followers
behind
the
passing
of
a
heavy
shower
was
the
next
scene
driving
them
to
shelter
in
a
shallow
cave
after
which
the
horses
were
put
in
and
they
started
to
return
homeward
by
the
time
they
reached
the
higher
levels
the
sky
had
again
cleared
and
the
sunset
rays
glanced
directly
upon
the
wet
uphill
road
they
had
climbed
the
ruts
formed
by
their
on
the
ascent
a
pair
of
liliputian
canals
were
as
shining
bars
of
gold
tapering
to
nothing
in
the
distance
upon
this
also
they
turned
their
backs
and
night
spread
over
the
sea
the
evening
was
chilly
and
there
was
no
moon
knight
sat
close
to
elfride
and
when
the
darkness
rendered
the
position
of
a
person
a
matter
of
uncertainty
particularly
close
elfride
edged
away
i
hope
you
allow
me
my
place
ungrudgingly
he
whispered
oh
yes
tis
the
least
i
can
do
in
common
civility
she
said
accenting
the
words
so
that
he
might
recognize
them
as
his
own
returned
both
of
them
felt
delicately
balanced
between
two
possibilities
thus
they
reached
home
to
knight
this
mild
experience
was
delightful
it
was
to
him
a
gentle
innocent
time
a
time
which
though
there
may
not
be
much
in
it
seldom
repeats
itself
in
a
man
s
life
and
has
a
peculiar
dearness
when
glanced
at
retrospectively
he
is
not
inconveniently
deep
in
love
and
is
lulled
by
a
peaceful
sense
of
being
able
to
enjoy
the
most
trivial
thing
with
a
childlike
enjoyment
the
movement
of
a
wave
the
colour
of
a
stone
anything
was
enough
for
knight
s
drowsy
thoughts
of
that
day
to
precipitate
themselves
upon
even
the
sermonizing
platitudes
the
vicar
had
delivered
himself
of
chiefly
because
something
seemed
to
be
professionally
required
of
him
in
the
presence
of
a
man
of
knight
s
proclivities
were
swallowed
whole
the
presence
of
elfride
led
him
not
merely
to
tolerate
that
kind
of
talk
from
the
necessities
of
ordinary
courtesy
but
he
listened
to
it
took
in
the
ideas
with
an
enjoyable
that
they
were
proper
and
necessary
and
indulged
in
a
conservative
feeling
that
the
face
of
things
was
complete
entering
her
room
that
evening
elfride
found
a
packet
for
herself
on
the
how
it
came
there
she
did
not
know
she
tremblingly
undid
the
folds
of
white
paper
that
covered
it
yes
it
was
the
treasure
of
a
morocco
case
containing
those
treasures
of
ornament
she
had
refused
in
the
daytime
elfride
dressed
herself
in
them
for
a
moment
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
blushed
red
and
put
them
away
they
filled
her
dreams
all
that
night
never
had
she
seen
anything
so
lovely
and
never
was
it
more
clear
that
as
an
honest
woman
she
was
in
duty
bound
to
refuse
them
why
it
was
not
equally
clear
to
her
that
duty
required
more
vigorous
conduct
as
well
let
those
who
dissect
her
say
the
next
morning
glared
in
like
a
spectre
upon
her
it
was
stephen
s
and
she
was
bound
to
meet
the
postman
to
stealthily
do
a
deed
she
had
never
liked
to
secure
an
end
she
now
had
ceased
to
desire
but
she
went
there
were
two
letters
one
was
from
the
bank
at
launce
s
in
which
she
had
a
small
private
deposit
probably
something
about
interest
she
put
that
in
her
pocket
for
a
moment
and
going
indoors
and
upstairs
to
be
safer
from
observation
tremblingly
opened
stephen
s
what
was
this
he
said
to
her
she
was
to
go
to
the
launce
s
bank
and
take
a
sum
of
money
which
they
had
received
private
advices
to
pay
her
the
sum
was
two
hundred
pounds
there
was
no
check
order
or
anything
of
the
nature
of
guarantee
in
fact
the
information
amounted
to
this
the
money
was
now
in
the
launce
s
bank
standing
in
her
name
she
instantly
opened
the
other
letter
it
contained
a
from
the
bank
for
the
sum
of
two
hundred
pounds
which
had
that
day
been
added
to
her
account
stephen
s
information
then
was
correct
and
the
transfer
made
i
have
saved
this
in
one
year
stephen
s
letter
went
on
to
say
and
what
so
proper
as
well
as
pleasant
for
me
to
do
as
to
hand
it
over
to
you
to
keep
for
your
use
i
have
plenty
for
myself
independently
of
this
should
you
not
be
disposed
to
let
it
lie
idle
in
the
bank
get
your
father
to
invest
it
in
your
name
on
good
security
it
is
a
little
present
to
you
from
your
more
than
betrothed
he
will
i
think
elfride
feel
now
that
my
pretensions
to
your
hand
are
anything
but
the
dream
of
a
silly
boy
not
worth
rational
with
a
natural
delicacy
elfride
in
mentioning
her
father
s
marriage
had
refrained
from
all
allusion
to
the
pecuniary
resources
of
the
lady
leaving
this
subject
he
went
on
somewhat
after
his
boyish
manner
do
you
remember
darling
that
first
morning
of
my
arrival
at
your
house
when
your
father
read
at
prayers
the
miracle
of
healing
the
sick
of
the
palsy
where
he
is
told
to
take
up
his
bed
and
walk
i
do
and
i
can
now
so
well
realize
the
force
of
that
passage
the
smallest
piece
of
mat
is
the
bed
of
the
oriental
and
yesterday
i
saw
a
native
perform
the
very
action
which
reminded
me
to
mention
it
but
you
are
better
read
than
i
and
perhaps
you
knew
all
this
long
ago
day
i
bought
some
small
native
idols
to
send
home
to
you
as
curiosities
but
afterwards
finding
they
had
been
cast
in
england
made
to
look
old
and
shipped
over
i
threw
them
away
in
disgust
speaking
of
this
reminds
me
that
we
are
obliged
to
import
all
our
ironwork
from
england
never
was
such
foresight
required
to
be
exercised
in
building
houses
as
here
before
we
begin
we
have
to
order
every
column
lock
hinge
and
screw
that
will
be
required
we
can
not
go
into
the
next
street
as
in
london
and
get
them
cast
at
a
minute
s
notice
says
somebody
will
have
to
go
to
england
very
soon
and
superintend
the
selection
of
a
large
order
of
this
kind
i
only
wish
i
may
be
the
there
before
her
lay
the
for
the
two
hundred
pounds
and
beside
it
the
elegant
present
of
knight
elfride
grew
cold
then
her
cheeks
felt
heated
by
beating
blood
if
by
destroying
the
piece
of
paper
the
whole
transaction
could
have
been
withdrawn
from
her
experience
she
would
willingly
have
sacrificed
the
money
it
represented
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
in
either
case
she
almost
feared
to
let
the
two
articles
lie
in
juxtaposition
so
antagonistic
were
the
interests
they
represented
that
a
miraculous
repulsion
of
one
by
the
other
was
almost
to
be
expected
that
day
she
was
seen
little
of
by
the
evening
she
had
come
to
a
resolution
and
acted
upon
it
the
packet
was
sealed
up
with
a
tear
of
regret
as
she
closed
the
case
upon
the
pretty
forms
it
contained
directed
and
placed
upon
the
in
knight
s
room
and
a
letter
was
written
to
stephen
stating
that
as
yet
she
hardly
understood
her
position
with
regard
to
the
money
sent
but
declaring
that
she
was
ready
to
fulfil
her
promise
to
marry
him
after
this
letter
had
been
written
she
delayed
posting
it
although
never
ceasing
to
feel
strenuously
that
the
deed
must
be
done
several
days
passed
there
was
another
indian
letter
for
elfride
coming
unexpectedly
her
father
saw
it
but
made
no
remark
why
she
could
not
tell
the
news
this
time
was
absolutely
overwhelming
stephen
as
he
had
wished
had
been
actually
chosen
as
the
most
fitting
to
execute
the
commission
he
had
alluded
to
as
impending
this
duty
completed
he
would
have
three
months
leave
his
letter
continued
that
he
should
follow
it
in
a
week
and
should
take
the
opportunity
to
plainly
ask
her
father
to
permit
the
engagement
then
came
a
page
expressive
of
his
delight
and
hers
at
the
reunion
and
finally
the
information
that
he
would
write
to
the
shipping
agents
asking
them
to
telegraph
and
tell
her
when
the
ship
bringing
him
home
should
be
in
sight
knowing
how
acceptable
such
information
would
be
elfride
lived
and
moved
now
as
in
a
dream
knight
had
at
first
become
almost
angry
at
her
persistent
refusal
of
his
offering
and
no
less
with
the
manner
than
the
fact
of
it
but
he
saw
that
she
began
to
look
worn
and
ill
and
his
vexation
lessened
to
simple
perplexity
he
ceased
now
to
remain
in
the
house
for
long
hours
together
as
before
but
made
it
a
mere
centre
for
antiquarian
and
geological
excursions
in
the
neighbourhood
throw
up
his
cards
and
go
away
he
fain
would
have
done
but
could
not
and
thus
availing
himself
of
the
privileges
of
a
relative
he
went
in
and
out
the
premises
as
fancy
led
him
but
still
lingered
on
i
don
t
wish
to
stay
here
another
day
if
my
presence
is
distasteful
he
said
one
afternoon
at
first
you
used
to
imply
that
i
was
severe
with
you
and
when
i
am
kind
you
treat
me
no
no
don
t
say
the
origin
of
their
acquaintanceship
had
been
such
as
to
render
their
manner
towards
each
other
peculiar
and
uncommon
it
was
of
a
kind
to
cause
them
to
speak
out
their
minds
on
any
feelings
of
objection
and
difference
to
be
reticent
on
gentler
matters
i
have
a
good
mind
to
go
away
and
never
trouble
you
again
continued
knight
she
said
nothing
but
the
eloquent
expression
of
her
eyes
and
wan
face
was
enough
to
reproach
him
for
harshness
do
you
like
me
to
be
here
then
inquired
knight
gently
yes
she
said
fidelity
to
the
old
love
and
truth
to
the
new
were
ranged
on
opposite
sides
and
truth
virtuelessly
prevailed
then
i
ll
stay
a
little
longer
said
knight
don
t
be
vexed
if
i
keep
by
myself
a
good
deal
will
you
perhaps
something
may
happen
and
i
may
tell
you
mere
coyness
said
knight
to
himself
and
went
away
with
a
lighter
heart
the
trick
of
reading
truly
the
enigmatical
forces
at
work
in
women
at
given
times
which
with
some
men
is
an
unerring
instinct
is
peculiar
to
minds
less
direct
and
honest
than
knight
s
the
next
evening
about
five
o
clock
before
knight
had
returned
from
a
pilgrimage
along
the
shore
a
man
walked
up
to
the
house
he
was
a
messenger
from
camelton
a
town
a
few
miles
off
to
which
place
the
railway
had
been
advanced
during
the
summer
a
telegram
for
miss
swancourt
and
three
and
sixpence
to
pay
for
the
special
miss
swancourt
sent
out
the
money
signed
the
paper
and
opened
her
letter
with
a
trembling
hand
she
read
johnson
liverpool
to
miss
swancourt
endelstow
near
castle
boterel
amaryllis
telegraphed
off
holyhead
four
o
clock
expect
will
dock
and
land
passengers
at
canning
s
basin
ten
o
clock
her
father
called
her
into
the
study
elfride
who
sent
you
that
message
he
asked
suspiciously
who
is
johnson
for
heaven
s
sake
i
don
t
the
deuce
you
don
t
who
is
to
know
then
i
have
never
heard
of
him
till
that
s
a
singular
story
isn
t
i
don
t
come
come
miss
what
was
the
telegram
do
you
really
wish
to
know
papa
well
i
remember
i
am
a
woman
well
what
then
being
a
woman
and
not
a
child
i
may
i
think
have
a
secret
or
you
will
it
women
have
as
a
but
don
t
keep
them
so
speak
if
you
will
not
press
me
now
i
give
my
word
to
tell
you
the
meaning
of
all
this
before
the
week
is
on
your
honour
on
my
very
well
i
have
had
a
certain
suspicion
you
know
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
find
it
false
i
don
t
like
your
manner
at
the
end
of
the
week
i
said
her
father
did
not
reply
and
elfride
left
the
room
she
began
to
look
out
for
the
postman
again
three
mornings
later
he
brought
an
inland
letter
from
stephen
it
contained
very
little
matter
having
been
written
in
haste
but
the
meaning
was
bulky
enough
stephen
said
that
having
executed
a
commission
in
liverpool
he
should
arrive
at
his
father
s
house
east
endelstow
at
five
or
six
o
clock
that
same
evening
that
he
would
after
dusk
walk
on
to
the
next
village
and
meet
her
if
she
would
in
the
church
porch
as
in
the
old
time
he
proposed
this
plan
because
he
thought
it
unadvisable
to
call
formally
at
her
house
so
late
in
the
evening
yet
he
could
not
sleep
without
having
seen
her
the
minutes
would
seem
hours
till
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
elfride
was
still
steadfast
in
her
opinion
that
honour
compelled
her
to
meet
him
probably
the
very
longing
to
avoid
him
lent
additional
weight
to
the
conviction
for
she
was
markedly
one
of
those
who
sigh
for
the
unattainable
to
whom
superlatively
a
hope
is
pleasing
because
not
a
possession
and
she
knew
it
so
well
that
her
intellect
was
inclined
to
exaggerate
this
defect
in
herself
so
during
the
day
she
looked
her
duty
steadfastly
in
the
face
read
wordsworth
s
astringent
yet
depressing
ode
to
that
deity
committed
herself
to
her
guidance
and
still
felt
the
weight
of
chance
desires
but
she
began
to
take
a
melancholy
pleasure
in
contemplating
the
sacrifice
of
herself
to
the
man
whom
a
maidenly
sense
of
propriety
compelled
her
to
regard
as
her
only
possible
husband
she
would
meet
him
and
do
all
that
lay
in
her
power
to
marry
him
to
guard
against
a
relapse
a
note
was
at
once
despatched
to
his
father
s
cottage
for
stephen
on
his
arrival
fixing
an
hour
for
the
interview
chapter
xxi
on
thy
cold
grey
stones
o
sea
stephen
had
said
that
he
should
come
by
way
of
bristol
and
thence
by
a
steamer
to
castle
boterel
in
order
to
avoid
the
long
journey
over
the
hills
from
launce
s
he
did
not
know
of
the
extension
of
the
railway
to
camelton
during
the
afternoon
a
thought
occurred
to
elfride
that
from
any
cliff
along
the
shore
it
would
be
possible
to
see
the
steamer
some
hours
before
its
arrival
she
had
accumulated
religious
force
enough
to
do
an
act
of
supererogation
the
act
was
this
to
go
to
some
point
of
land
and
watch
for
the
ship
that
brought
her
future
husband
home
it
was
a
cloudy
afternoon
elfride
was
often
diverted
from
a
purpose
by
a
dull
sky
and
though
she
used
to
persuade
herself
that
the
weather
was
as
fine
as
possible
on
the
other
side
of
the
clouds
she
could
not
bring
about
any
practical
result
from
this
fancy
now
her
mood
was
such
that
the
humid
sky
harmonized
with
it
having
ascended
and
passed
over
a
hill
behind
the
house
elfride
came
to
a
small
stream
she
used
it
as
a
guide
to
the
coast
it
was
smaller
than
that
in
her
own
valley
and
flowed
altogether
at
a
higher
level
bushes
lined
the
slopes
of
its
shallow
trough
but
at
the
bottom
where
the
water
ran
was
a
soft
green
carpet
in
a
strip
two
or
three
yards
wide
in
winter
the
water
flowed
over
the
grass
in
summer
as
now
it
trickled
along
a
channel
in
the
midst
elfride
had
a
sensation
of
eyes
regarding
her
from
somewhere
she
turned
and
there
was
knight
he
had
dropped
into
the
valley
from
the
side
of
the
hill
she
felt
a
thrill
of
pleasure
and
rebelliously
allowed
it
to
exist
what
utter
loneliness
to
find
you
in
i
am
going
to
the
shore
by
tracking
the
stream
i
believe
it
empties
itself
not
far
off
in
a
silver
thread
of
water
over
a
cascade
of
great
why
do
you
load
yourself
with
that
heavy
telescope
to
look
over
the
sea
with
it
she
said
faintly
i
ll
carry
it
for
you
to
your
journey
s
and
he
took
the
glass
from
her
unresisting
hands
it
can
not
be
half
a
mile
further
see
there
is
the
he
pointed
to
a
short
fragment
of
level
colour
cutting
against
the
sky
elfride
had
already
scanned
the
small
surface
of
ocean
visible
and
had
seen
no
ship
they
walked
along
in
company
sometimes
with
the
brook
between
them
for
it
was
no
wider
than
a
man
s
stride
sometimes
close
together
the
green
carpet
grew
swampy
and
they
kept
higher
up
one
of
the
two
ridges
between
which
they
walked
dwindled
lower
and
became
insignificant
that
on
the
right
hand
rose
with
their
advance
and
terminated
in
a
clearly
defined
edge
against
the
light
as
if
it
were
abruptly
sawn
off
a
little
further
and
the
bed
of
the
rivulet
ended
in
the
same
fashion
they
had
come
to
a
bank
and
over
it
the
valley
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
it
was
withdrawn
cleanly
and
completely
in
its
place
was
sky
and
boundless
atmosphere
and
perpendicularly
down
beneath
them
small
and
far
off
lay
the
corrugated
surface
of
the
atlantic
the
small
stream
here
found
its
death
running
over
the
precipice
it
was
dispersed
in
spray
before
it
was
down
and
falling
like
rain
upon
projecting
ledges
made
minute
grassy
meadows
of
them
at
the
bottom
the
soaked
away
amid
the
debris
of
the
cliff
this
was
the
inglorious
end
of
the
river
what
are
you
looking
for
said
knight
following
the
direction
of
her
eyes
she
was
gazing
hard
at
a
black
object
nearer
to
the
shore
than
to
the
horizon
from
the
summit
of
which
came
a
nebulous
haze
stretching
like
gauze
over
the
sea
the
puffin
a
little
summer
steamboat
from
bristol
to
castle
boterel
she
said
i
think
that
is
it
look
will
you
give
me
the
glass
knight
pulled
open
the
but
powerful
telescope
and
handed
it
to
elfride
who
had
looked
on
with
heavy
eyes
i
can
t
keep
it
up
now
she
said
rest
it
on
my
it
is
too
under
my
too
low
you
may
look
instead
she
murmured
weakly
knight
raised
the
glass
to
his
eye
and
swept
the
sea
till
the
puffin
entered
its
field
yes
it
is
the
puffin
a
tiny
craft
i
can
see
her
distinctly
a
bird
with
a
beak
as
big
as
its
can
you
see
the
deck
wait
a
minute
yes
pretty
clearly
and
i
can
see
the
black
forms
of
the
passengers
against
its
white
surface
one
of
them
has
taken
something
from
another
a
glass
i
think
yes
it
is
and
he
is
levelling
it
in
this
direction
depend
upon
it
we
are
conspicuous
objects
against
the
sky
to
them
now
it
seems
to
rain
upon
them
and
they
put
on
overcoats
and
open
umbrellas
they
vanish
and
go
below
all
but
that
one
who
has
borrowed
the
glass
he
is
a
slim
young
fellow
and
still
watches
elfride
grew
pale
and
shifted
her
little
feet
uneasily
knight
lowered
the
glass
i
think
we
had
better
return
he
said
that
cloud
which
is
raining
on
them
may
soon
reach
us
why
you
look
how
is
that
something
in
the
air
affects
my
those
fair
cheeks
are
very
fastidious
i
fear
returned
knight
tenderly
this
air
would
make
those
rosy
that
were
never
so
before
one
would
think
eh
nature
s
spoilt
child
elfride
s
colour
returned
again
there
is
more
to
see
behind
us
after
all
said
knight
she
turned
her
back
upon
the
boat
and
stephen
smith
and
saw
towering
still
higher
than
themselves
the
vertical
face
of
the
hill
on
the
right
which
did
not
project
seaward
so
far
as
the
bed
of
the
valley
but
formed
the
back
of
a
small
cove
and
so
was
visible
like
a
concave
wall
bending
round
from
their
position
towards
the
left
the
composition
of
the
huge
hill
was
revealed
to
its
backbone
and
marrow
here
at
its
rent
extremity
it
consisted
of
a
vast
stratification
of
slate
unvaried
in
its
whole
height
by
a
single
change
of
shade
it
is
with
cliffs
and
mountains
as
with
persons
they
have
what
is
called
a
presence
which
is
not
necessarily
proportionate
to
their
actual
bulk
a
little
cliff
will
impress
you
powerfully
a
great
one
not
at
all
it
depends
as
with
man
upon
the
countenance
of
the
cliff
i
can
not
bear
to
look
at
that
cliff
said
elfride
it
has
a
horrid
personality
and
makes
me
shudder
we
will
can
you
climb
said
knight
if
so
we
will
ascend
by
that
path
over
the
grim
old
fellow
s
try
me
said
elfride
disdainfully
i
have
ascended
steeper
slopes
than
from
where
they
had
been
loitering
a
grassy
path
wound
along
inside
a
bank
placed
as
a
safeguard
for
unwary
pedestrians
to
the
top
of
the
precipice
and
over
it
along
the
hill
in
an
inland
direction
take
my
arm
miss
swancourt
said
knight
i
can
get
on
better
without
it
thank
when
they
were
one
quarter
of
the
way
up
elfride
stopped
to
take
breath
knight
stretched
out
his
hand
she
took
it
and
they
ascended
the
remaining
slope
together
reaching
the
very
top
they
sat
down
to
rest
by
mutual
consent
heavens
what
an
altitude
said
knight
between
his
pants
and
looking
far
over
the
sea
the
cascade
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
appeared
a
mere
span
in
height
from
where
they
were
now
elfride
was
looking
to
the
left
the
steamboat
was
in
full
view
again
and
by
reason
of
the
vast
surface
of
sea
their
higher
position
uncovered
it
seemed
almost
close
to
the
shore
over
that
edge
said
knight
where
nothing
but
vacancy
appears
is
a
moving
compact
mass
the
wind
strikes
the
face
of
the
rock
runs
up
it
rises
like
a
fountain
to
a
height
far
above
our
heads
curls
over
us
in
an
arch
and
disperses
behind
us
in
fact
an
inverted
cascade
is
there
as
perfect
as
the
niagara
falls
but
rising
instead
of
falling
and
air
instead
of
water
now
look
knight
threw
a
stone
over
the
bank
aiming
it
as
if
to
go
onward
over
the
cliff
reaching
the
verge
it
towered
into
the
air
like
a
bird
turned
back
and
alighted
on
the
ground
behind
them
they
themselves
were
in
a
dead
calm
a
boat
crosses
niagara
immediately
at
the
foot
of
the
falls
where
the
water
is
quite
still
the
fallen
mass
curving
under
it
we
are
in
precisely
the
same
position
with
regard
to
our
atmospheric
cataract
here
if
you
run
back
from
the
cliff
fifty
yards
you
will
be
in
a
brisk
wind
now
i
daresay
over
the
bank
is
a
little
backward
knight
rose
and
leant
over
the
bank
no
sooner
was
his
head
above
it
than
his
hat
appeared
to
be
sucked
from
his
head
slipping
over
his
forehead
in
a
seaward
direction
that
s
the
backward
eddy
as
i
told
you
he
cried
and
vanished
over
the
little
bank
after
his
hat
elfride
waited
one
minute
he
did
not
return
she
waited
another
and
there
was
no
sign
of
him
a
few
drops
of
rain
fell
then
a
sudden
shower
she
arose
and
looked
over
the
bank
on
the
other
side
were
two
or
three
yards
of
level
ground
then
a
short
steep
preparatory
slope
then
the
verge
of
the
precipice
on
the
slope
was
knight
his
hat
on
his
head
he
was
on
his
hands
and
knees
trying
to
climb
back
to
the
level
ground
the
rain
had
wetted
the
shaly
surface
of
the
incline
a
slight
superficial
wetting
of
the
soil
hereabout
made
it
far
more
slippery
to
stand
on
than
the
same
soil
thoroughly
drenched
the
inner
substance
was
still
hard
and
was
lubricated
by
the
moistened
film
i
find
a
difficulty
in
getting
back
said
knight
elfride
s
heart
fell
like
lead
but
you
can
get
back
she
wildly
inquired
knight
strove
with
all
his
might
for
two
or
three
minutes
and
the
drops
of
perspiration
began
to
bead
his
brow
no
i
am
unable
to
do
it
he
answered
elfride
by
a
wrench
of
thought
forced
away
from
her
mind
the
sensation
that
knight
was
in
bodily
danger
but
attempt
to
help
him
she
must
she
ventured
upon
the
treacherous
incline
propped
herself
with
the
closed
telescope
and
gave
him
her
hand
before
he
saw
her
movements
o
elfride
why
did
you
said
he
i
am
afraid
you
have
only
endangered
and
as
if
to
prove
his
statement
in
making
an
endeavour
by
her
assistance
they
both
slipped
lower
and
then
he
was
again
stayed
his
foot
was
propped
by
a
bracket
of
quartz
rock
balanced
on
the
verge
of
the
precipice
fixed
by
this
he
steadied
her
her
head
being
about
a
foot
below
the
beginning
of
the
slope
elfride
had
dropped
the
glass
it
rolled
to
the
edge
and
vanished
over
it
into
a
nether
sky
hold
tightly
to
me
he
said
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
with
such
a
firm
grasp
that
whilst
he
remained
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
fall
don
t
be
flurried
knight
continued
so
long
as
we
stay
above
this
block
we
are
perfectly
safe
wait
a
moment
whilst
i
consider
what
we
had
better
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
dizzy
depths
beneath
them
and
surveyed
the
position
of
affairs
two
glances
told
him
a
tale
with
ghastly
distinctness
it
was
that
unless
they
performed
their
feat
of
getting
up
the
slope
with
the
precision
of
machines
they
were
over
the
edge
and
whirling
in
for
this
purpose
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
recover
the
breath
and
strength
which
his
previous
efforts
had
cost
him
so
he
still
waited
and
looked
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
the
crest
of
this
terrible
natural
facade
passed
among
the
neighbouring
inhabitants
as
being
seven
hundred
feet
above
the
water
it
overhung
it
had
been
proved
by
actual
measurement
to
be
not
a
foot
less
than
six
hundred
and
fifty
that
is
to
say
it
is
nearly
three
times
the
height
of
flamborough
half
as
high
again
as
the
south
foreland
a
hundred
feet
higher
than
beachy
head
the
loftiest
promontory
on
the
east
or
south
side
of
this
island
twice
the
height
of
aldhelm
s
thrice
as
high
as
the
lizard
and
just
double
the
height
of
bee
s
one
point
on
the
western
coast
is
known
to
surpass
it
in
altitude
but
only
by
a
few
feet
this
is
great
orme
s
head
in
caernarvonshire
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
cliff
exhibits
an
intensifying
feature
which
some
of
those
are
without
sheer
perpendicularity
from
the
level
yet
this
remarkable
rampart
forms
no
headland
it
rather
walls
in
an
inlet
the
promontory
on
each
side
being
much
lower
thus
far
from
being
salient
its
horizontal
section
is
concave
the
sea
rolling
direct
from
the
shores
of
north
america
has
in
fact
eaten
a
chasm
into
the
middle
of
a
hill
and
the
giant
embayed
and
unobtrusive
stands
in
the
rear
of
pigmy
supporters
not
least
singularly
neither
hill
chasm
nor
precipice
has
a
name
on
this
account
i
will
call
the
precipice
the
cliff
without
a
name
see
preface
what
gave
an
added
terror
to
its
height
was
its
blackness
and
upon
this
dark
face
the
beating
of
ten
thousand
west
winds
had
formed
a
kind
of
bloom
which
had
a
visual
effect
not
unlike
that
of
a
hambro
grape
moreover
it
seemed
to
float
off
into
the
atmosphere
and
inspire
terror
through
the
lungs
this
piece
of
quartz
supporting
my
feet
is
on
the
very
nose
of
the
cliff
said
knight
breaking
the
silence
after
his
rigid
stoical
meditation
now
what
you
are
to
do
is
this
clamber
up
my
body
till
your
feet
are
on
my
shoulders
when
you
are
there
you
will
i
think
be
able
to
climb
on
to
level
what
will
you
do
wait
whilst
you
run
for
i
ought
to
have
done
that
in
the
first
place
ought
i
not
i
was
in
the
act
of
slipping
and
should
have
reached
no
without
your
weight
in
all
probability
but
don
t
let
us
talk
be
brave
elfride
and
she
prepared
to
ascend
saying
this
is
the
moment
i
anticipated
when
on
the
tower
i
thought
it
would
come
this
is
not
a
time
for
superstition
said
knight
dismiss
all
i
will
she
said
humbly
now
put
your
foot
into
my
hand
next
the
other
that
s
good
well
done
hold
to
my
she
placed
her
feet
upon
the
stirrup
he
made
of
his
hand
and
was
high
enough
to
get
a
view
of
the
natural
surface
of
the
hill
over
the
bank
can
you
now
climb
on
to
level
ground
i
am
afraid
not
i
will
what
can
you
see
the
sloping
what
upon
it
purple
heather
and
some
nothing
more
no
man
or
human
being
of
any
kind
now
try
to
get
higher
in
this
way
you
see
that
tuft
of
above
you
get
that
well
into
your
hand
but
don
t
trust
to
it
entirely
then
step
upon
my
shoulder
and
i
think
you
will
reach
the
with
trembling
limbs
she
did
exactly
as
he
told
her
the
preternatural
quiet
and
solemnity
of
his
manner
overspread
upon
herself
and
gave
her
a
courage
not
her
own
she
made
a
spring
from
the
top
of
his
shoulder
and
was
up
then
she
turned
to
look
at
him
by
an
ill
fate
the
force
downwards
of
her
bound
added
to
his
own
weight
had
been
too
much
for
the
block
of
quartz
upon
which
his
feet
depended
it
was
indeed
originally
an
igneous
protrusion
into
the
enormous
masses
of
black
strata
which
had
since
been
worn
away
from
the
sides
of
the
alien
fragment
by
centuries
of
frost
and
rain
and
now
left
it
without
much
support
it
moved
knight
seized
a
tuft
of
with
each
hand
the
quartz
rock
which
had
been
his
salvation
was
worse
than
useless
now
it
rolled
over
out
of
sight
and
away
into
the
same
nether
sky
that
had
engulfed
the
telescope
one
of
the
tufts
by
which
he
held
came
out
at
the
root
and
knight
began
to
follow
the
quartz
it
was
a
terrible
moment
elfride
uttered
a
low
wild
wail
of
agony
bowed
her
head
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
between
the
slope
and
the
gigantic
perpendicular
rock
intervened
a
series
of
jagged
edges
forming
a
face
yet
steeper
than
the
former
slope
as
he
slowly
slid
inch
by
inch
upon
these
knight
made
a
last
desperate
dash
at
the
lowest
tuft
of
vegetation
the
last
outlying
knot
of
starved
herbage
ere
the
rock
appeared
in
all
its
bareness
it
arrested
his
further
descent
knight
was
now
literally
suspended
by
his
arms
but
the
incline
of
the
brow
being
what
engineers
would
call
about
a
quarter
in
one
it
was
sufficient
to
relieve
his
arms
of
a
portion
of
his
weight
but
was
very
far
from
offering
an
adequately
flat
face
to
support
him
in
spite
of
this
dreadful
tension
of
body
and
mind
knight
found
time
for
a
moment
of
thankfulness
elfride
was
safe
she
lay
on
her
side
above
him
her
fingers
clasped
seeing
him
again
steady
she
jumped
upon
her
feet
now
if
i
can
only
save
you
by
running
for
help
she
cried
oh
i
would
have
died
instead
why
did
you
try
so
hard
to
deliver
me
and
she
turned
away
wildly
to
run
for
assistance
elfride
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
run
to
endelstow
and
back
of
an
that
won
t
do
my
hands
will
not
hold
out
ten
minutes
and
is
there
nobody
nearer
no
unless
a
chance
passer
may
happen
to
he
would
have
nothing
with
him
that
could
save
me
is
there
a
pole
or
stick
of
any
kind
on
the
common
she
gazed
around
the
common
was
bare
of
everything
but
heather
and
grass
a
minute
perhaps
more
time
was
passed
in
mute
thought
by
both
on
a
sudden
the
blank
and
helpless
agony
left
her
face
she
vanished
over
the
bank
from
his
sight
knight
felt
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
personalized
loneliness
chapter
xxii
a
woman
s
haggard
cliffs
of
every
ugly
altitude
are
as
common
as
along
the
line
of
coast
between
exmoor
and
land
s
end
but
this
outflanked
and
encompassed
specimen
was
the
ugliest
of
them
all
their
summits
are
not
safe
places
for
scientific
experiment
on
the
principles
of
as
knight
had
now
found
to
his
dismay
he
still
clutched
the
face
of
the
escarpment
not
with
the
frenzied
hold
of
despair
but
with
a
dogged
determination
to
make
the
most
of
his
every
jot
of
endurance
and
so
give
the
longest
possible
scope
to
elfride
s
intentions
whatever
they
might
be
he
reclined
hand
in
hand
with
the
world
in
its
infancy
not
a
blade
not
an
insect
which
spoke
of
the
present
was
between
him
and
the
past
the
inveterate
antagonism
of
these
black
precipices
to
all
strugglers
for
life
is
in
no
way
more
forcibly
suggested
than
by
the
paucity
of
tufts
of
grass
lichens
or
confervae
on
their
outermost
ledges
knight
pondered
on
the
meaning
of
elfride
s
hasty
disappearance
but
could
not
avoid
an
instinctive
conclusion
that
there
existed
but
a
doubtful
hope
for
him
as
far
as
he
could
judge
his
sole
chance
of
deliverance
lay
in
the
possibility
of
a
rope
or
pole
being
brought
and
this
possibility
was
remote
indeed
the
soil
upon
these
high
downs
was
left
so
untended
that
they
were
unenclosed
for
miles
except
by
a
casual
bank
or
dry
wall
and
were
rarely
visited
but
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
or
counting
the
flock
which
found
a
scanty
means
of
subsistence
thereon
at
first
when
death
appeared
improbable
because
it
had
never
visited
him
before
knight
could
think
of
no
future
nor
of
anything
connected
with
his
past
he
could
only
look
sternly
at
nature
s
treacherous
attempt
to
put
an
end
to
him
and
strive
to
thwart
her
from
the
fact
that
the
cliff
formed
the
inner
face
of
the
segment
of
a
huge
cylinder
having
the
sky
for
a
top
and
the
sea
for
a
bottom
which
enclosed
the
cove
to
the
extent
of
more
than
a
semicircle
he
could
see
the
vertical
face
curving
round
on
each
side
of
him
he
looked
far
down
the
facade
and
realized
more
thoroughly
how
it
threatened
him
grimness
was
in
every
feature
and
to
its
very
bowels
the
inimical
shape
was
desolation
by
one
of
those
familiar
conjunctions
of
things
wherewith
the
inanimate
world
baits
the
mind
of
man
when
he
pauses
in
moments
of
suspense
opposite
knight
s
eyes
was
an
imbedded
fossil
standing
forth
in
low
relief
from
the
rock
it
was
a
creature
with
eyes
the
eyes
dead
and
turned
to
stone
were
even
now
regarding
him
it
was
one
of
the
early
crustaceans
called
trilobites
separated
by
millions
of
years
in
their
lives
knight
and
this
underling
seemed
to
have
met
in
their
death
it
was
the
single
instance
within
reach
of
his
vision
of
anything
that
had
ever
been
alive
and
had
had
a
body
to
save
as
he
himself
had
now
the
creature
represented
but
a
low
type
of
animal
existence
for
never
in
their
vernal
years
had
the
plains
indicated
by
those
numberless
slaty
layers
been
traversed
by
an
intelligence
worthy
of
the
name
zoophytes
mollusca
were
the
highest
developments
of
those
ancient
dates
the
immense
lapses
of
time
each
formation
represented
had
known
nothing
of
the
dignity
of
man
they
were
grand
times
but
they
were
mean
times
too
and
mean
were
their
relics
he
was
to
be
with
the
small
in
his
death
knight
was
a
geologist
and
such
is
the
supremacy
of
habit
over
occasion
as
a
pioneer
of
the
thoughts
of
men
that
at
this
dreadful
juncture
his
mind
found
time
to
take
in
by
a
momentary
sweep
the
varied
scenes
that
had
had
their
day
between
this
creature
s
epoch
and
his
own
there
is
no
place
like
a
cleft
landscape
for
bringing
home
such
imaginings
as
these
time
closed
up
like
a
fan
before
him
he
saw
himself
at
one
extremity
of
the
years
face
to
face
with
the
beginning
and
all
the
intermediate
centuries
simultaneously
fierce
men
clothed
in
the
hides
of
beasts
and
carrying
for
defence
and
attack
huge
clubs
and
pointed
spears
rose
from
the
rock
like
the
phantoms
before
the
doomed
macbeth
they
lived
in
hollows
woods
and
mud
huts
perhaps
in
caves
of
the
neighbouring
rocks
behind
them
stood
an
earlier
band
no
man
was
there
huge
elephantine
forms
the
mastodon
the
hippopotamus
the
tapir
antelopes
of
monstrous
size
the
megatherium
and
the
myledon
all
for
the
moment
in
juxtaposition
further
back
and
overlapped
by
these
were
perched
birds
and
swinish
creatures
as
large
as
horses
still
more
shadowy
were
the
sinister
crocodilian
outlines
alligators
and
other
uncouth
shapes
culminating
in
the
colossal
lizard
the
iguanodon
folded
behind
were
dragon
forms
and
clouds
of
flying
reptiles
still
underneath
were
fishy
beings
of
lower
development
and
so
on
till
the
lifetime
scenes
of
the
fossil
confronting
him
were
a
present
and
modern
condition
of
things
these
images
passed
before
knight
s
inner
eye
in
less
than
half
a
minute
and
he
was
again
considering
the
actual
present
was
he
to
die
the
mental
picture
of
elfride
in
the
world
without
himself
to
cherish
her
smote
his
heart
like
a
whip
he
had
hoped
for
deliverance
but
what
could
a
girl
do
he
dared
not
move
an
inch
was
death
really
stretching
out
his
hand
the
previous
sensation
that
it
was
improbable
he
would
die
was
fainter
now
however
knight
still
clung
to
the
cliff
to
those
musing
folk
who
pass
the
greater
part
of
their
days
and
nights
out
of
doors
nature
seems
to
have
moods
in
other
than
a
poetical
sense
predilections
for
certain
deeds
at
certain
times
without
any
apparent
law
to
govern
or
season
to
account
for
them
she
is
read
as
a
person
with
a
curious
temper
as
one
who
does
not
scatter
kindnesses
and
cruelties
alternately
impartially
and
in
order
but
heartless
severities
or
overwhelming
generosities
in
lawless
caprice
man
s
case
is
always
that
of
the
prodigal
s
favourite
or
the
miser
s
pensioner
in
her
unfriendly
moments
there
seems
a
feline
fun
in
her
tricks
begotten
by
a
foretaste
of
her
pleasure
in
swallowing
the
victim
such
a
way
of
thinking
had
been
absurd
to
knight
but
he
began
to
adopt
it
now
he
was
first
spitted
on
to
a
rock
new
tortures
followed
the
rain
increased
and
persecuted
him
with
an
exceptional
persistency
which
he
was
moved
to
believe
owed
its
cause
to
the
fact
that
he
was
in
such
a
wretched
state
already
an
entirely
new
order
of
things
could
be
observed
in
this
introduction
of
rain
upon
the
scene
it
rained
upwards
instead
of
down
the
strong
ascending
air
carried
the
with
it
in
its
race
up
the
escarpment
coming
to
him
with
such
velocity
that
they
stuck
into
his
flesh
like
cold
needles
each
drop
was
virtually
a
shaft
and
it
pierced
him
to
his
skin
the
seemed
to
lift
him
on
their
points
no
downward
rain
ever
had
such
a
torturing
effect
in
a
brief
space
he
was
drenched
except
in
two
places
these
were
on
the
top
of
his
shoulders
and
on
the
crown
of
his
hat
the
wind
though
not
intense
in
other
situations
was
strong
here
it
tugged
at
his
coat
and
lifted
it
we
are
mostly
accustomed
to
look
upon
all
opposition
which
is
not
animate
as
that
of
the
stolid
inexorable
hand
of
indifference
which
wears
out
the
patience
more
than
the
strength
here
at
any
rate
hostility
did
not
assume
that
slow
and
sickening
form
it
was
a
cosmic
agency
active
lashing
eager
for
conquest
determination
not
an
insensate
standing
in
the
way
knight
had
the
strength
of
his
hands
they
were
getting
weak
already
she
will
never
come
again
she
has
been
gone
ten
minutes
he
said
to
himself
this
mistake
arose
from
the
unusual
compression
of
his
experiences
just
now
she
had
really
been
gone
but
three
as
many
more
minutes
will
be
my
end
he
thought
next
came
another
instance
of
the
incapacity
of
the
mind
to
make
comparisons
at
such
times
this
is
a
summer
afternoon
he
said
and
there
can
never
have
been
such
a
heavy
and
cold
rain
on
a
summer
day
in
my
life
he
was
again
mistaken
the
rain
was
quite
ordinary
in
quantity
the
air
in
temperature
it
was
as
is
usual
the
menacing
attitude
in
which
they
approached
him
that
magnified
their
powers
he
again
looked
straight
downwards
the
wind
and
the
lifting
his
moustache
scudding
up
his
cheeks
under
his
eyelids
and
into
his
eyes
this
is
what
he
saw
down
there
the
surface
of
the
sea
visually
just
past
his
toes
and
under
his
feet
actually
of
a
mile
or
more
than
two
hundred
yards
below
them
we
colour
according
to
our
moods
the
objects
we
survey
the
sea
would
have
been
a
deep
neutral
blue
had
happier
auspices
attended
the
gazer
it
was
now
no
otherwise
than
distinctly
black
to
his
vision
that
narrow
white
border
was
foam
he
knew
well
but
its
boisterous
tosses
were
so
distant
as
to
appear
a
pulsation
only
and
its
plashing
was
barely
audible
a
white
border
to
a
black
sea
his
funeral
pall
and
its
edging
the
world
was
to
some
extent
turned
upside
down
for
him
rain
descended
from
below
beneath
his
feet
was
aerial
space
and
the
unknown
above
him
was
the
firm
familiar
ground
and
upon
it
all
that
he
loved
best
pitiless
nature
had
then
two
voices
and
two
only
the
nearer
was
the
voice
of
the
wind
in
his
ears
rising
and
falling
as
it
mauled
and
thrust
him
hard
or
softly
the
second
and
distant
one
was
the
moan
of
that
unplummetted
ocean
below
and
afar
rubbing
its
restless
flank
against
the
cliff
without
a
name
knight
perseveringly
held
fast
had
he
any
faith
in
elfride
perhaps
love
is
faith
and
faith
like
a
gathered
flower
will
rootlessly
live
on
nobody
would
have
expected
the
sun
to
shine
on
such
an
evening
as
this
yet
it
appeared
low
down
upon
the
sea
not
with
its
natural
golden
fringe
sweeping
the
furthest
ends
of
the
landscape
not
with
the
strange
glare
of
whiteness
which
it
sometimes
puts
on
as
an
alternative
to
colour
but
as
a
splotch
of
vermilion
red
upon
a
leaden
ground
a
red
face
looking
on
with
a
drunken
leer
most
men
who
have
brains
know
it
and
few
are
so
foolish
as
to
disguise
this
fact
from
themselves
or
others
even
though
an
ostentatious
display
may
be
called
knight
without
showing
it
much
knew
that
his
intellect
was
above
the
average
and
he
thought
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
his
death
would
be
a
deliberate
loss
to
earth
of
good
material
that
such
an
experiment
in
killing
might
have
been
practised
upon
some
less
developed
life
a
fancy
some
people
hold
when
in
a
bitter
mood
is
that
inexorable
circumstance
only
tries
to
prevent
what
intelligence
attempts
renounce
a
desire
for
a
position
and
go
on
another
tack
and
after
a
while
the
prize
is
thrown
at
you
seemingly
in
disappointment
that
no
more
tantalizing
is
possible
knight
gave
up
thoughts
of
life
utterly
and
entirely
and
turned
to
contemplate
the
dark
valley
and
the
unknown
future
beyond
into
the
shadowy
depths
of
these
speculations
we
will
not
follow
him
let
it
suffice
to
state
what
ensued
at
that
moment
of
taking
no
more
thought
for
this
life
something
disturbed
the
outline
of
the
bank
above
him
a
spot
appeared
it
was
the
head
of
elfride
knight
immediately
prepared
to
welcome
life
again
the
expression
of
a
face
consigned
to
utter
loneliness
when
a
friend
first
looks
in
upon
it
is
moving
in
the
extreme
in
rowing
seaward
to
a
or
lighthouse
where
without
any
immediate
terror
of
death
the
inmates
experience
the
gloom
of
monotonous
seclusion
the
grateful
eloquence
of
their
countenances
at
the
greeting
expressive
of
thankfulness
for
the
visit
is
enough
to
stir
the
emotions
of
the
most
careless
observer
knight
s
upward
look
at
elfride
was
of
a
nature
with
but
far
transcending
such
an
instance
as
this
the
lines
of
his
face
had
deepened
to
furrows
and
every
one
of
them
thanked
her
visibly
his
lips
moved
to
the
word
elfride
though
the
emotion
evolved
no
sound
his
eyes
passed
all
description
in
their
combination
of
the
whole
diapason
of
eloquence
from
lover
s
deep
love
to
s
gratitude
for
a
token
of
remembrance
from
one
of
his
kind
elfride
had
come
back
what
she
had
come
to
do
he
did
not
know
she
could
only
look
on
at
his
death
perhaps
still
she
had
come
back
and
not
deserted
him
utterly
and
it
was
much
it
was
a
novelty
in
the
extreme
to
see
henry
knight
to
whom
elfride
was
but
a
child
who
had
swayed
her
as
a
tree
sways
a
bird
s
nest
who
mastered
her
and
made
her
weep
most
bitterly
at
her
own
insignificance
thus
thankful
for
a
sight
of
her
face
she
looked
down
upon
him
her
face
glistening
with
rain
and
tears
he
smiled
faintly
how
calm
he
is
she
thought
how
great
and
noble
he
is
to
be
so
calm
she
would
have
died
ten
times
for
him
then
the
gliding
form
of
the
steamboat
caught
her
eye
she
heeded
it
no
longer
how
much
longer
can
you
wait
came
from
her
pale
lips
and
along
the
wind
to
his
position
four
minutes
said
knight
in
a
weaker
voice
than
her
own
but
with
a
good
hope
of
being
saved
seven
or
he
now
noticed
that
in
her
arms
she
bore
a
bundle
of
white
linen
and
that
her
form
was
singularly
attenuated
so
preternaturally
thin
and
flexible
was
elfride
at
this
moment
that
she
appeared
to
bend
under
the
light
blows
of
the
as
they
struck
into
her
sides
and
bosom
and
splintered
into
spray
on
her
face
there
is
nothing
like
a
thorough
drenching
for
reducing
the
protuberances
of
clothes
but
elfride
s
seemed
to
cling
to
her
like
a
glove
without
heeding
the
attack
of
the
clouds
further
than
by
raising
her
hand
and
wiping
away
the
spirts
of
rain
when
they
went
more
particularly
into
her
eyes
she
sat
down
and
hurriedly
began
rending
the
linen
into
strips
these
she
knotted
end
to
end
and
afterwards
twisted
them
like
the
strands
of
a
cord
in
a
short
space
of
time
she
had
formed
a
perfect
rope
by
this
means
six
or
seven
yards
long
can
you
wait
while
i
bind
it
she
said
anxiously
extending
her
gaze
down
to
him
yes
if
not
very
long
hope
has
given
me
a
wonderful
instalment
of
elfride
dropped
her
eyes
again
tore
the
remaining
material
into
narrow
ligaments
knotted
each
to
each
as
before
but
on
a
smaller
scale
and
wound
the
lengthy
string
she
had
thus
formed
round
and
round
the
linen
rope
which
without
this
binding
had
a
tendency
to
spread
abroad
now
said
knight
who
watching
the
proceedings
intently
had
by
this
time
not
only
grasped
her
scheme
but
reasoned
further
on
i
can
hold
three
minutes
longer
yet
and
do
you
use
the
time
in
testing
the
strength
of
the
knots
one
by
she
at
once
obeyed
tested
each
singly
by
putting
her
foot
on
the
rope
between
each
knot
and
pulling
with
her
hands
one
of
the
knots
slipped
oh
think
it
would
have
broken
but
for
your
forethought
elfride
exclaimed
apprehensively
she
retied
the
two
ends
the
rope
was
now
firm
in
every
part
when
you
have
let
it
down
said
knight
already
resuming
his
position
of
ruling
power
go
back
from
the
edge
of
the
slope
and
over
the
bank
as
far
as
the
rope
will
allow
you
then
lean
down
and
hold
the
end
with
both
he
had
first
thought
of
a
safer
plan
for
his
own
deliverance
but
it
involved
the
disadvantage
of
possibly
endangering
her
life
i
have
tied
it
round
my
waist
she
cried
and
i
will
lean
directly
upon
the
bank
holding
with
my
hands
as
it
was
the
arrangement
he
had
thought
of
but
would
not
suggest
i
will
raise
and
drop
it
three
times
when
i
am
behind
the
bank
she
continued
to
signify
that
i
am
ready
take
care
oh
take
the
greatest
care
i
beg
you
she
dropped
the
rope
over
him
to
learn
how
much
of
its
length
it
would
be
necessary
to
expend
on
that
side
of
the
bank
went
back
and
disappeared
as
she
had
done
before
the
rope
was
trailing
by
knight
s
shoulders
in
a
few
moments
it
twitched
three
times
he
waited
yet
a
second
or
two
then
laid
hold
the
incline
of
this
upper
portion
of
the
precipice
to
the
length
only
of
a
few
feet
useless
to
a
climber
was
invaluable
now
not
more
than
half
his
weight
depended
entirely
on
the
linen
rope
half
a
dozen
extensions
of
the
arms
alternating
with
half
a
dozen
seizures
of
the
rope
with
his
feet
brought
him
up
to
the
level
of
the
soil
he
was
saved
and
by
elfride
he
extended
his
cramped
limbs
like
an
awakened
sleeper
and
sprang
over
the
bank
at
sight
of
him
she
leapt
to
her
feet
with
almost
a
shriek
of
joy
knight
s
eyes
met
hers
and
with
supreme
eloquence
the
glance
of
each
told
a
tale
of
emotion
in
that
short
moved
by
an
impulse
neither
could
resist
they
ran
together
and
into
each
other
s
arms
at
the
moment
of
embracing
elfride
s
eyes
involuntarily
flashed
towards
the
puffin
steamboat
it
had
doubled
the
point
and
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
an
overwhelming
rush
of
exultation
at
having
delivered
the
man
she
revered
from
one
of
the
most
terrible
forms
of
death
shook
the
gentle
girl
to
the
centre
of
her
soul
it
merged
in
a
defiance
of
duty
to
stephen
and
a
total
recklessness
as
to
plighted
faith
every
nerve
of
her
will
was
now
in
entire
subjection
to
her
feeling
volition
as
a
guiding
power
had
forsaken
her
to
remain
passive
as
she
remained
now
encircled
by
his
arms
was
a
sufficiently
complete
result
a
glorious
crown
to
all
the
years
of
her
life
perhaps
he
was
only
grateful
and
did
not
love
her
no
matter
it
was
infinitely
more
to
be
even
the
slave
of
the
greater
than
the
queen
of
the
less
some
such
sensation
as
this
though
it
was
not
recognized
as
a
finished
thought
raced
along
the
impressionable
soul
of
elfride
regarding
their
attitude
it
was
impossible
for
two
persons
to
go
nearer
to
a
kiss
than
went
knight
and
elfride
during
those
minutes
of
impulsive
embrace
in
the
pelting
rain
yet
they
did
not
kiss
knight
s
peculiarity
of
nature
was
such
that
it
would
not
allow
him
to
take
advantage
of
the
unguarded
and
passionate
avowal
she
had
tacitly
made
elfride
recovered
herself
and
gently
struggled
to
be
free
he
reluctantly
relinquished
her
and
then
surveyed
her
from
crown
to
toe
she
seemed
as
small
as
an
infant
he
perceived
whence
she
had
obtained
the
rope
elfride
my
elfride
he
exclaimed
in
gratified
amazement
i
must
leave
you
now
she
said
her
face
doubling
its
red
with
an
expression
between
gladness
and
shame
you
follow
me
but
at
some
the
rain
and
wind
pierce
you
through
the
chill
will
kill
you
god
bless
you
for
such
devotion
take
my
coat
and
put
it
no
i
shall
get
warm
elfride
had
absolutely
nothing
between
her
and
the
weather
but
her
exterior
robe
or
the
door
had
been
made
upon
a
woman
s
wit
and
it
had
found
its
way
out
behind
the
bank
whilst
knight
reclined
upon
the
dizzy
slope
waiting
for
death
she
had
taken
off
her
whole
clothing
and
replaced
only
her
outer
bodice
and
skirt
every
thread
of
the
remainder
lay
upon
the
ground
in
the
form
of
a
woollen
and
cotton
rope
i
am
used
to
being
wet
through
she
added
i
have
been
drenched
on
pansy
dozens
of
times
till
we
meet
clothed
and
in
our
right
minds
by
the
fireside
at
home
she
then
ran
off
from
him
through
the
pelting
rain
like
a
hare
or
more
like
a
pheasant
when
scampering
away
with
a
lowered
tail
it
has
a
mind
to
fly
but
does
not
elfride
was
soon
out
of
sight
knight
felt
uncomfortably
wet
and
chilled
but
glowing
with
fervour
nevertheless
he
fully
appreciated
elfride
s
girlish
delicacy
in
refusing
his
escort
in
the
meagre
habiliments
she
wore
yet
felt
that
necessary
abstraction
of
herself
for
a
short
as
a
most
grievous
loss
to
him
he
gathered
up
her
knotted
and
twisted
plumage
of
linen
lace
and
embroidery
work
and
laid
it
across
his
arm
he
noticed
on
the
ground
an
envelope
limp
and
wet
in
endeavouring
to
restore
this
to
its
proper
shape
he
loosened
from
the
envelope
a
piece
of
paper
it
had
contained
which
was
seized
by
the
wind
in
falling
from
knight
s
hand
it
was
blown
to
the
right
blown
to
the
left
it
floated
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
over
the
sea
where
it
was
hurled
aloft
it
twirled
in
the
air
and
then
flew
back
over
his
head
knight
followed
the
paper
and
secured
it
having
done
so
he
looked
to
discover
if
it
had
been
worth
securing
the
troublesome
sheet
was
a
banker
s
receipt
for
two
hundred
pounds
placed
to
the
credit
of
miss
swancourt
which
the
impractical
girl
had
totally
forgotten
she
carried
with
her
knight
folded
it
as
carefully
as
its
moist
condition
would
allow

it
in
his
pocket
and

forgot
by
this

stephen
smith
had
stepped
out
upon
the
quay
at
castle
boterel
and
breathed
his
native
air
a
darker
skin
a
more
pronounced
moustache
and
an
incipient
beard
were
the
chief
additions
and
changes
noticeable
in
his
appearance
in
spite
of
the
falling
rain
which
had
somewhat
lessened
he
took
a
small
valise
in
his
hand
and
leaving
the
remainder
of
his
luggage
at
the
inn
ascended
the
hills
towards
east
endelstow
this
place
lay
in
a
vale
of
its
own
further
inland
than

so
near
it
had
little
of

was
free
from
those
bleak
open
uplands
which
lent
such
an
air
of
desolation
to
the
vicinage
of
the
coast
always
excepting
the
small
valley
in
which
stood
the
vicarage
and
swancourt
s
old
house
the
crags
stephen
had
arrived
nearly
at
the
summit
of
the
ridge
when
the
rain
again
increased
its
volume
and
looking
about
for
temporary
shelter
he
ascended
a
steep
path
which
penetrated
dense
hazel
bushes
in
the
lower
part
of
its
course
further
up
it
emerged
upon
a
ledge
immediately
over
the
and
sheltered
by
an
overhanging
face
of
rubble
rock
with
bushes
above
for
a
reason
of
his
own
he
made
this
spot
his
refuge
from
the
storm
and
turning
his
face
to
the
left
conned
the
landscape
as
a
book
he
was
overlooking
the
valley
containing
elfride
s
residence
from
this
point
of
observation
the
prospect
exhibited
the
peculiarity
of
being
either
brilliant
foreground
or
the
subdued
tone
of
distance
a
sudden
dip
in
the
surface
of
the
country
lowering
out
of
sight
all
the
intermediate
prospect
in
apparent
contact
with
the
trees
and
bushes
growing
close
beside
him
appeared
the
distant
tract
terminated
suddenly
by
the
brink
of
the
series
of
cliffs
which
culminated
in
the
tall
giant
without
a
name
small
and
unimportant
as
here
beheld
a
leaf
on
a
bough
at
stephen
s
elbow
blotted
out
a
whole
hill
in
the
contrasting
district
far
away
a
green
bunch
of
nuts
covered
a
complete
upland
there
and
the
great
cliff
itself
was
outvied
by
a
pigmy
crag
in
the
bank
hard
by
him
stephen
had
looked
upon
these
things
hundreds
of
times
before
but
he
had
never
viewed
them
with
such
tenderness
as
now
stepping
forward
in
this
direction
yet
a
little
further
he
could
see
the
tower
of
west
endelstow
church
beneath
which
he
was
to
meet
his
elfride
that
night
and
at
the
same
time
he
noticed
coming
over
the
hill
from
the
cliffs
a
white
speck
in
motion
it
seemed
first
to
be
a
flying
low
but
ultimately
proved
to
be
a
human
figure
running
with
great
rapidity
the
form
flitted
on
heedless
of
the
rain
which
had
caused
stephen
s
halt
in
this
place
dropped
down
the
heathery
hill
entered
the
vale
and
was
out
of
sight
whilst
he
meditated
upon
the
meaning
of
this
phenomenon
he
was
surprised
to
see
swim
into
his
ken
from
the
same
point
of
departure
another
moving
speck
as
different
from
the
first
as
well
could
be
insomuch
that
it
was
perceptible
only
by
its
blackness
slowly
and
regularly
it
took
the
same
course
and
there
was
not
much
doubt
that
this
was
the
form
of
a
man
he
too
gradually
descended
from
the
upper
levels
and
was
lost
in
the
valley
below
the
rain
had
by
this
time
again
abated
and
stephen
returned
to
the
road
looking
ahead
he
saw
two
men
and
a
cart
they
were
soon
obscured
by
the
intervention
of
a
high
hedge
just
before
they
emerged
again
he
heard
voices
in
conversation
a
must
soon
be
in
the
naibourhood
too
if
so
be
he
s
said
a
tenor
tongue
which
stephen
instantly
recognized
as
martin
cannister
s
a
must
a
b
lieve
said
another
voice
that
of
stephen
s
father
stephen
stepped
forward
and
came
before
them
face
to
face
his
father
and
martin
were
walking
dressed
in
their
second
best
suits
and
beside
them
rambled
along
a
grizzel
horse
and
brightly
painted
all
right
cannister
here
s
the
lost
man
exclaimed
young
smith
entering
at
once
upon
the
old
style
of
greeting
father
here
i
all
right
my
sonny
and
glad
i
be
for
t
returned
john
smith
overjoyed
to
see
the
young
man
how
be
ye
well
come
along
home
and
don
t
let
s
bide
out
here
in
the
damp
such
weather

be
terrible
bad
for
a
young
chap
just
come
from
a
fiery
nation
like
indy
hey
naibour
cannister
trew
trew
and
about
getting
home
his
traps
boxes
monstrous
bales
and
noble
packages
of
foreign
description
i
make
no
doubt
hardly
all
that
said
stephen
laughing
we
brought
the
cart
maning
to
go
right
on
to
castle
boterel
afore
ye
landed
said
his
father
put
in
the
horse
says
martin
ay
says
i
so
we
will
and
did
it
straightway
now
maybe
martin

on
wi
the
cart
for
the
things
and
you
and
i
walk
and
i
shall
be
back

pretty
step

to
tell
upon
her
as
upon
the
rest
o
stephen
told
martin
where
to
find
his
baggage
and
then
continued
his
journey
homeward
in
the
company
of
his
father
owing
to
your
coming
a
day
sooner
than
we
first
expected
said
john

a
turk
of
a
mess

i
to
my

son
but

good

few
nice
new

and
a
drop
of
shilling
ale
to
wash

down
your
mother
have
scrubbed
the
house
through
because
ye
were
coming
and
dusted
all
the
chimmer
furniture
and
bought
a
new
basin
and
jug
of
a
travelling
that
came
to
our
door
and
scoured
the
and
claned
the
winders
ay
i
don
t
know
what
a
ha
n
t
a
done
never
were
such
a
steer
a
b
conversation
of
this
kind
and
inquiries
of
stephen
for
his
mother
s
wellbeing
occupied
them
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
when
they
drew
near
the
river
and
the
cottage
behind
it
they
could
hear
the
s
clock
striking
off
the
bygone
hours
of
the
day
at
intervals
of
a
quarter
of
a
minute
during
which
intervals
stephen
s
imagination
readily
pictured
his
mother
s
forefinger
wandering
round
the
dial
in
company
with
the
the
clock
stopped
this
morning
and
your
mother
in
putting
en
right
seemingly
said
his
father
in
an
explanatory
tone
and
they
went
up
the
garden
to
the
door
when
they
had
entered
and
stephen
had
dutifully
and
warmly
greeted
his
mother
who
appeared
in
a
cotton
dress
of
a
ground
covered
broadcast
with
a
multitude
of
new
and
full
moons
stars
and
planets
with
an
occasional
dash
of
a
aspect
to
diversify
the
scene
the
crackle
of
was
heard
outside
and
martin
cannister
stamped
in
at
the
doorway
in
the
form
of
a
pair
of
legs
beneath
a
great
box
his
body
being
nowhere
visible
when
the
luggage
had
been
all
taken
down
and
stephen
had
gone
upstairs
to
change
his
clothes
smith
s
mind
seemed
to
recover
a
lost
thread
really
our
clock
is
not
worth
a
penny
she
said
turning
to
it
and
attempting
to
start
the
pendulum
stopped
again
inquired
martin
with
commiseration
yes
sure
replied
smith
and
continued
after
the
manner
of
certain
matrons
to
whose
tongues
the
harmony
of
a
subject
with
a
casual
mood
is
a
greater
recommendation
than
its
pertinence
to
the
occasion
john
would
spend
pounds
a
year
upon
the
jimcrack
old
thing
if
he
might
in
having
it
claned
when
at
the
same
time
you
may
doctor
it
yourself
as
well
the
clock
s
stopped
again
john
i
say
to
him
better
have
en
claned
says
he
there
s
five
shillings
that
clock
grinds
again
i
say
to
en
better
have
en
claned
a
says
again
that
clock
strikes
wrong
john
says
i
better
have
en
claned
he
goes
on
the
wheels
would
have
been
polished
to
skeletons
by
this
time
if
i
had
listened
to
en
and
i
assure
you
we
could
have
bought
a
beauty
wi
the
good
money
we
ve
flung
away
these
last
ten
years
upon
this
old
mortal
and
martin
you
must
be
wet
my
son
is
gone
up
to
change
john
is
damper
than
i
should
like
to
be
but
a
calls
it
nothing
some
of
swancourt
s
servants
have
been
here
they
ran
in
out
of
the
rain
when
going
for
a
walk
and
i
assure
you
the
state
of
their
bonnets
was
how
s
the
folks
we
ve
been
over
to
castle
boterel
and
what
wi
running
and
stopping
out
of
the
storms
my
poor
head
is
beyond
everything
fizz
fizz
fizz
tis
frying
o
fish
from
morning
to
night
said
a
cracked
voice
in
the
doorway
at
this
instant
lord
so
s
who
s
that
said
smith
in
a
private
exclamation
and
turning
round
saw
william
worm
endeavouring
to
make
himself
look
passing
civil
and
friendly
by
overspreading
his
face
with
a
large
smile
that
seemed
to
have
no
connection
with
the
humour
he
was
in
behind
him
stood
a
woman
about
twice
his
size
with
a
large
umbrella
over
her
head
this
was
mrs
worm
william
s
wife
come
in
william
said
john
smith

t

day

mrs
worm
i
make
ye
welcome
since
ye
left

truth
since

took
to
the
line
i
ve
been
out
but
little
coming
to

and
i
said

john
i

i
assure

o
bacon
and
inions
ay
i
can
hear
the
fat
pop
and
fizz
as
nateral
as
life
can
t
i
barbara
mrs
worm
who
had
been
all
this
time
engaged
in
closing
her
umbrella
corroborated
this
statement
and
now
coming
indoors
showed
herself
to
be
a
woman
with
a
wart
upon
her
cheek
bearing
a
small
tuft
of
hair
in
its
centre
have
ye
ever
tried
anything
to
cure
yer
noise
maister
worm
inquired
martin
cannister
oh
ay
bless
ye
i
ve
tried
everything
ay
providence
is
a
merciful
man
and
i
have
hoped
he
d
have
found
it
out
by
this
time
living
so
many
years
in
a
parson
s
family
too
as
i
have
but
a
don
t
seem
to
relieve
me
ay
i
be
a
poor
wambling
man
and
life
s
a
mint
o
trouble
true
mournful
true
william
worm
tis
so
the
world
wants
looking
to
or
tis
all
sixes
and
sevens
wi
take
your
things
off
worm
said
smith
we
be
rather
in
a
muddle
to
tell
the
truth
for
my
son
is
just
dropped
in
from
indy
a
day
sooner
than
we
expected
and
the
is
coming
presently
to
cut
barbara
worm
not
wishing
to
take
any
mean
advantage
of
persons
in
a
muddle
by
observing
them
removed
her
bonnet
and
mantle
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
flowers
in
the
plot
outside
the
door
what
beautiful
said
mrs
worm
yes
they
be
very
well
but
such
a
trouble
to
me
on
account
of
the
children
that
come
here
they
will
go
eating
the
berries
on
the
stem
and
call
em
currants
taste
wi
junivals
is
quite
fancy
and
your
snapdragons
look
as
fierce
as
well
really
answered
smith
entering
didactically
into
the
subject
they
are
more
like
christians
than
flowers
but
they
make
up
well
enough
wi
the
rest
and
don
t
require
much
tending
and
the
same
can
be
said
o
these
miller
s
wheels
tis
a
flower
i
like
very
much
though
so
simple
john
says
he
never
cares
about
the
flowers
o
em
but
men
have
no
eye
for
anything
neat
he
says
his
favourite
flower
is
a
cauliflower
and
i
assure
you
i
tremble
in
the
springtime
for
tis
perfect
you
don
t
say
so
smith
john
digs
round
the
roots
you
know
in
goes
his
blundering
spade
through
roots
bulbs
everything
that
hasn
t
got
a
good
show
above
ground
turning
em
up
cut
all
to
slices
only
the
very
last
fall
i
went
to
move
some
tulips
when
i
found
every
bulb
upside
down
and
the
stems
crooked
round
he
had
turned
em
over
in
the
spring
and
the
cunning
creatures
had
soon
found
that
heaven
was
not
where
it
used
to
what
s
that
flower
under
the
hedge
they
o
lord
they
are
the
horrid
jacob
s
ladders
instead
of
praising
em
i
be
mad
wi
em
for
being
so
ready
to
bide
where
they
are
not
wanted
they
be
very
well
in
their
way
but
i
do
not
care
for
things
that
neglect
won
t
kill
do
what
i
will
dig
drag
scrap
pull
i
get
too
many
of
em
i
chop
the
roots
up
they
ll
come
treble
strong
throw
em
over
hedge
there
they
ll
grow
staring
me
in
the
face
like
a
hungry
dog
driven
away
and
creep
back
again
in
a
week
or
two
the
same
as
before
tis
jacob
s
ladder
here
jacob
s
ladder
there
and
plant
em
where
nothing
in
the
world
will
grow
you
get
crowds
of
em
in
a
month
or
two
john
made
a
new
manure
mixen
last
summer
and
he
said
maria
now
if
you
ve
got
any
flowers
or
such
like
that
you
don
t
want
you
may
plant
em
round
my
mixen
so
as
to
hide
it
a
bit
though
tis
not
likely
anything
of
much
value
will
grow
i
thought
there
s
them
jacob
s
ladders
i
ll
put
them
there
since
they
can
t
do
harm
in
such
a
place
and
i
planted
the
jacob
s
ladders
sure
enough
they
growed
and
they
growed
in
the
mixen
and
out
of
the
mixen
all
over
the
litter
covering
it
quite
up
when
john
wanted
to
use
it
about
the
garden
a
said
nation
seize
them
jacob
s
ladders
of
yours
maria
they
ve
eat
the
goodness
out
of
every
morsel
of
my
manure
so
that
tis
no
better
than
sand
itself
sure
enough
the
hungry
mortals
had
tis
my
belief
that
in
the
secret
souls
o
em
jacob
s
ladders
be
weeds
and
not
flowers
at
all
if
the
truth
was
robert
lickpan
and
carrier
arrived
at
this
moment
the
fatted
animal
hanging
in
the
back
kitchen
was
cleft
down
the
middle
of
its
backbone
smith
being
meanwhile
engaged
in
cooking
supper
between
the
cutting
and
chopping
ale
was
handed
round
and
worm
and
the
listened
to
john
smith
s
description
of
the
meeting
with
stephen
with
eyes
blankly
fixed
upon
the
in
order
that
nothing
in
the
external
world
should
interrupt
their
efforts
to
conjure
up
the
scene
correctly
stephen
came
downstairs
in
the
middle
of
the
story
and
after
the
little
interruption
occasioned
by
his
entrance
and
welcome
the
narrative
was
again
continued
precisely
as
if
he
had
not
been
there
at
all
and
was
told
inclusively
to
him
as
to
somebody
who
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
ay
i
said
as
i
catched
sight
o
en
through
the
brimbles
that
s
the
lad
for
i
d
know
en
by
his
s
walk
for
a
stapped
out
like
poor
father
for
all
the
world
still
there
was
a
touch
o
the
frisky
that
set
me
wondering
a
got
closer
and
i
said
that
s
the
lad
for
i
d
know
en
by
his
carrying
a
black
case
like
a
travelling
still
a
road
is
common
to
all
the
world
and
there
be
more
travelling
men
than
one
but
i
kept
my
eye
cocked
and
i
said
to
martin
tis
the
boy
now
for
i
d
know
en
by
the
wold
twirl
o
the
stick
and
the
family
then
a
come
closer
and
a
said
all
i
could
swear
to
en
stephen
s
personal
appearance
was
next
criticised
he
d
look
a
deal
thinner
in
face
surely
than
when
i
seed
en

en
if
ye

believe
me
said
martin
ay
there
said
another
without
removing
his
eyes
from
stephen
s
face
i
should
ha
knowed
en
anywhere
tis
his
father
s
nose
to
a
it
has
been
often
remarked
said
stephen
modestly
and
he
s
certainly
taller
said
martin
letting
his
glance
run
over
stephen
s
form
from
bottom
to
top
i
was
thinking
a
was
exactly
the
same
height
worm
replied
bless
thy
soul
that
s
because
he
s
bigger
round
and
the
united
eyes
all
moved
to
stephen
s
waist
i
be
a
poor
wambling
man
but
i
can
make
allowances
said
william
worm
ah
sure
and
how
he
came
as
a
stranger
and
pilgrim
to
parson
swancourt
s
that
time
not
a
soul
knowing
en
after
so
many
years
ay
life
s
a
strange
picter
stephen
but
i
suppose
i
must
say
sir
to
ye
oh
it
is
not
necessary
at
present
stephen
replied
though
mentally
resolving
to
avoid
the
vicinity
of
that
familiar
friend
as
soon
as
he
had
made
pretensions
to
the
hand
of
elfride
ah
well
said
worm
musingly
some
would
have
looked
for
no
less
than
a
sir
there
s
a
sight
of
difference
in
and
in
pigs
likewise
observed
john
smith
looking
at
the
halved
carcass
of
his
own
robert
lickpan
the
here
seemed
called
upon
to
enter
the
lists
of
conversation
yes
they
ve
got
their
particular
naters
he
remarked
initially
many
s
the
pig
i
ve
i
don
t
doubt
it
master
lickpan
answered
martin
in
a
tone
expressing
that
his
convictions
no
less
than
good
manners
demanded
the
reply
yes
continued
the
as
one
accustomed
to
be
heard
one
that
i
knowed
was
deaf
and
dumb
and
we
couldn
t
make
out
what
was
the
matter
wi
the
pig
a
would
eat
well
enough
when
a
seed
the
trough
but
when
his
back
was
turned
you
might
the
bucket
all
day
the
poor
soul
never
heard
ye
ye
could
play
tricks
upon
en
behind
his
back
and
a
wouldn
t
find
it
out
no
quicker
than
poor
deaf
grammer
cates
but
a
fatted
well
and
i
never
seed
a
pig
open
better
when
a
was
killed
and
a
was
very
tender
eating
very
as
pretty
a
bit
of
mate
as
ever
you
see
you
could
suck
that
mate
through
a
quill
and
another
i
knowed
resumed
the
killer
after
quietly
letting
a
pint
of
ale
run
down
his
throat
of
its
own
accord
and
setting
down
the
cup
with
mathematical
exactness
upon
the
spot
from
which
he
had
raised
it
another
went
out
of
his
how
very
mournful
murmured
mrs
worm
ay
poor
thing
a
did
as
clean
out
of
his
mind
as
the
cleverest
christian
could
go
in
early
life
a
was
very
melancholy
and
never
seemed
a
hopeful
pig
by
no
means
twas
andrew
stainer
s
pig
that
s
whose
pig
i
can
mind
the
pig
well
enough
attested
john
smith
and
a
pretty
little
porker
a
was
and
you
all
know
farmer
buckle
s
sort
every
jack
o
em
suffer
from
the
rheumatism
to
this
day
owing
to
a
damp
sty
they
lived
in
when
they
were
striplings
as
well
now
we
ll
weigh
said
john
if
so
be
he
were
not
so
fine
we
d
weigh
en
whole
but
as
he
is
we
ll
take
a
side
at
a
time
john
you
can
mind
my
old
joke
ey
i
do
so
though
twas
a
good
few
years
ago
i
first
heard
yes
said
lickpan
that
there
old
familiar
joke
have
been
in
our
family
for
generations
i
may
say
my
father
used
that
joke
regular
at
for
more
than
five
and
forty
years
the
time
he
followed
the
calling
and
a
told
me
that
a
had
it
from
his
father
when
he
was
quite
a
chiel
who
made
use
o
en
just
the
same
at
every
killing
more
or
less
and
were
in
those
trewly
they
i
ve
never
heard
the
joke
said
smith
tentatively
nor
i
chimed
in
mrs
worm
who
being
the
only
other
lady
in
the
room
felt
bound
by
the
laws
of
courtesy
to
feel
like
smith
in
everything
surely
surely
you
have
said
the
killer
looking
sceptically
at
the
benighted
females
however
tisn
t
much
i
don
t
wish
to
say
it
is
it
commences
like
this
bob
will
tell
the
weight
of
your
pig
a
b
lieve
says
i
the
congregation
of
neighbours
think
i
mane
my
son
bob
naturally
but
the
secret
is
that
i
mane
the
bob
o
the
steelyard
ha
ha
ha
haw
haw
haw
laughed
martin
cannister
who
had
heard
the
explanation
of
this
striking
story
for
the
hundredth
time
huh
huh
huh
laughed
john
smith
who
had
heard
it
for
the
thousandth
hee
hee
hee
laughed
william
worm
who
had
never
heard
it
at
all
but
was
afraid
to
say
so
thy
grandfather
robert
must
have
been
a
chap
to
make
that
story
said
martin
cannister
subsiding
to
a
placid
aspect
of
delighted
criticism
he
had
a
head
by
all
account
and
you
see
as
the
of
the
lickpans
have
all
been
roberts
they
ve
all
been
bobs
so
the
story
was
handed
down
to
the
present
poor
joseph
your
second
boy
will
never
be
able
to
bring
it
out
in
company
which
is
rather
unfortunate
said
mrs
worm
thoughtfully
a
won
t
yes
grandfer
was
a
clever
chap
as
ye
say
but
i
knowed
a
cleverer
twas
my
uncle
levi
uncle
levi
made
a
that
should
be
a
puzzle
to
his
friends
to
open
he
used
to
hand
en
round
at
wedding
parties
christenings
funerals
and
in
other
jolly
company
and
let
em
try
their
skill
this
extraordinary
had
a
spring
behind
that
would
push
in
and
out
a
hinge
where
seemed
to
be
the
cover
a
slide
at
the
end
a
screw
in
front
and
knobs
and
queer
notches
everywhere
one
man
would
try
the
spring
another
would
try
the
screw
another
would
try
the
slide
but
try
as
they
would
the
box
wouldn
t
open
and
they
couldn
t
open
en
and
they
didn
t
open
en
now
what
might
you
think
was
the
secret
of
that
box
all
put
on
an
expression
that
their
united
thoughts
were
inadequate
to
the
occasion
why
the
box
wouldn
t
open
at
all
a
were
made
not
to
open
and
ye
might
have
tried
till
the
end
of
revelations
twould
have
been
as
naught
for
the
box
were
glued
all
a
very
deep
man
to
have
made
such
a
yes
twas
like
uncle
levi
all
twas
i
can
mind
the
man
very
well
tallest
man
ever
i
a
was
so
he
never
slept
upon
a
bedstead
after
he
growed
up
a
hard
never
could
get
one
long
enough
when
a
lived
in
that
little
small
house
by
the
pond
he
used
to
have
to
leave
open
his
chamber
door
every
night
at
going
to
his
bed
and
let
his
feet
poke
out
upon
the
he
s
dead
and
gone
now
nevertheless
poor
man
as
we
all
shall
observed
worm
to
fill
the
pause
which
followed
the
conclusion
of
robert
lickpan
s
speech
the
weighing
and
cutting
up
was
pursued
amid
an
animated
discourse
on
stephen
s
travels
and
at
the
finish
the
of
the
day
s
slaughter
fried
in
onions
were
then
turned
from
the
pan
into
a
dish
on
the
table
each
piece
steaming
and
hissing
till
it
reached
their
very
mouths
it
must
be
owned
that
the
gentlemanly
son
of
the
house
looked
rather
out
of
place
in
the
course
of
this
operation
nor
was
his
mind
quite
philosophic
enough
to
allow
him
to
be
comfortable
with
these
persons
his
father
s
friends
he
had
never
lived
long
at
home
scarcely
at
all
since
his
childhood
the
presence
of
william
worm
was
the
most
awkward
feature
of
the
case
for
though
worm
had
left
the
house
of
swancourt
the
being
with
a
servitor
reminded
stephen
too
forcibly
of
the
vicar
s
classification
of
himself
before
he
went
from
england
smith
was
conscious
of
the
defect
in
her
arrangements
which
had
brought
about
the
undesired
conjunction
she
spoke
to
stephen
privately
i
am
above
having
such
people
here
stephen
but
what
could
i
do
and
your
father
is
so
rough
in
his
nature
that
he
s
more
mixed
up
with
them
than
need
never
mind
mother
said
stephen
i
ll
put
up
with
it
when
we
leave
my
lord
s
service
and
get
further
up
the
country
as
i
hope
we
shall
soon
it
will
be
different
we
shall
be
among
fresh
people
and
in
a
larger
house
and
shall
keep
ourselves
up
a
bit
i
is
miss
swancourt
at
home
do
you
know
stephen
inquired
yes
your
father
saw
her
this
do
you
often
see
her
scarcely
ever
glim
the
curate
calls
occasionally
but
the
swancourts
don
t
come
into
the
village
now
any
more
than
to
drive
through
it
they
dine
at
my
lord
s
oftener
than
they
used
ah
here
s
a
note
was
brought
this
morning
for
you
by
a
stephen
eagerly
took
the
note
and
opened
it
his
mother
watching
him
he
read
what
elfride
had
written
and
sent
before
she
started
for
the
cliff
that
afternoon
yes
i
will
meet
you
in
the
church
at
nine
e
i
don
t
know
stephen
his
mother
said
meaningly
whe
r
you
still
think
about
miss
elfride
but
if
i
were
you
i
wouldn
t
concern
about
her
they
say
that
none
of
old
swancourt
s
money
will
come
to
her
i
see
the
evening
has
turned
out
fine
i
am
going
out
for
a
little
while
to
look
round
the
place
he
said
evading
the
direct
query
probably
by
the
time
i
return
our
visitors
will
be
gone
and
we
ll
have
a
more
confidential
chapter
xxiv
breeze
bird
and
flower
confess
the
the
rain
had
ceased
since
the
sunset
but
it
was
a
cloudy
night
and
the
light
of
the
moon
softened
and
dispersed
by
its
misty
veil
was
distributed
over
the
land
in
pale
gray
a
dark
figure
stepped
from
the
doorway
of
john
smith
s
cottage
and
strode
rapidly
towards
west
endelstow
with
a
light
footstep
soon
ascending
from
the
lower
levels
he
turned
a
corner
followed
a
and
saw
the
tower
of
the
church
he
was
in
quest
of
distinctly
shaped
forth
against
the
sky
in
less
than
half
an
hour
from
the
time
of
starting
he
swung
himself
over
the
churchyard
stile
the
wild
irregular
enclosure
was
as
much
as
ever
an
integral
part
of
the
old
hill
the
grass
was
still
long
the
graves
were
shaped
precisely
as
passing
years
chose
to
alter
them
from
their
orthodox
form
as
laid
down
by
martin
cannister
and
by
stephen
s
own
grandfather
before
him
a
sound
sped
into
the
air
from
the
direction
in
which
castle
boterel
lay
it
was
the
striking
of
the
church
clock
distinct
in
the
still
atmosphere
as
if
it
had
come
from
the
tower
hard
by
which
wrapt
in
its
solitary
silentness
gave
out
no
such
sounds
of
life
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
stephen
carefully
counted
the
strokes
though
he
well
knew
their
number
beforehand
nine
o
clock
it
was
the
hour
elfride
had
herself
named
as
the
most
convenient
for
meeting
him
stephen
stood
at
the
door
of
the
porch
and
listened
he
could
have
heard
the
softest
breathing
of
any
person
within
the
porch
nobody
was
there
he
went
inside
the
doorway
sat
down
upon
the
stone
bench
and
waited
with
a
beating
heart
the
faint
sounds
heard
only
accentuated
the
silence
the
rising
and
falling
of
the
sea
far
away
along
the
coast
was
the
most
important
a
minor
sound
was
the
scurr
of
a
distant
among
the
minutest
where
all
were
minute
were
the
light
settlement
of
gossamer
fragments
floating
in
the
air
a
toad
humbly
labouring
along
through
the
grass
near
the
entrance
the
crackle
of
a
dead
leaf
which
a
worm
was
endeavouring
to
pull
into
the
earth
a
waft
of
air
getting
nearer
and
nearer
and
expiring
at
his
feet
under
the
burden
of
a
winged
seed
among
all
these
soft
sounds
came
not
the
only
soft
sound
he
cared
to
hear
the
footfall
of
elfride
for
a
whole
quarter
of
an
hour
stephen
sat
thus
intent
without
moving
a
muscle
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
walked
to
the
west
front
of
the
church
turning
the
corner
of
the
tower
a
white
form
stared
him
in
the
face
he
started
back
and
recovered
himself
it
was
the
tomb
of
young
farmer
jethway
looking
still
as
fresh
and
as
new
as
when
it
was
first
erected
the
white
stone
in
which
it
was
hewn
having
a
singular
weirdness
amid
the
dark
blue
slabs
from
local
quarries
of
which
the
whole
remaining
gravestones
were
formed
he
thought
of
the
night
when
he
had
sat
thereon
with
elfride
as
his
companion
and
well
remembered
his
regret
that
she
had
received
even
unwillingly
earlier
homage
than
his
own
but
his
present
tangible
anxiety
reduced
such
a
feeling
to
sentimental
nonsense
in
comparison
and
he
strolled
on
over
the
graves
to
the
border
of
the
churchyard
whence
in
the
daytime
could
be
clearly
seen
the
vicarage
and
the
present
residence
of
the
swancourts
no
footstep
was
discernible
upon
the
path
up
the
hill
but
a
light
was
shining
from
a
window
in
the
house
stephen
knew
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
the
time
or
place
and
no
difficulty
about
keeping
the
engagement
he
waited
yet
longer
passing
from
impatience
into
a
mood
which
failed
to
take
any
account
of
the
lapse
of
time
he
was
awakened
from
his
reverie
by
castle
boterel
clock
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
one
little
fall
of
the
hammer
in
addition
to
the
number
it
had
been
sharp
pleasure
to
hear
and
what
a
difference
to
him
he
left
the
churchyard
on
the
side
opposite
to
his
point
of
entrance
and
went
down
the
hill
slowly
he
drew
near
the
gate
of
her
house
this
he
softly
opened
and
walked
up
the
gravel
drive
to
the
door
here
he
paused
for
several
minutes
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
the
murmured
speech
of
a
manly
voice
came
out
to
his
ears
through
an
open
window
behind
the
corner
of
the
house
this
was
responded
to
by
a
clear
soft
laugh
it
was
the
laugh
of
elfride
stephen
was
conscious
of
a
gnawing
pain
at
his
heart
he
retreated
as
he
had
come
there
are
disappointments
which
wring
us
and
there
are
those
which
inflict
a
wound
whose
mark
we
bear
to
our
graves
such
are
so
keen
that
no
future
gratification
of
the
same
desire
can
ever
obliterate
them
they
become
registered
as
a
permanent
loss
of
happiness
such
a
one
was
stephen
s
now
the
crowning
aureola
of
the
dream
had
been
the
meeting
here
by
stealth
and
if
elfride
had
come
to
him
only
ten
minutes
after
he
had
turned
away
the
disappointment
would
have
been
recognizable
still
when
the
young
man
reached
home
he
found
there
a
letter
which
had
arrived
in
his
absence
believing
it
to
contain
some
reason
for
her
yet
unable
to
imagine
one
that
could
justify
her
he
hastily
tore
open
the
envelope
the
paper
contained
not
a
word
from
elfride
it
was
the
for
his
two
hundred
pounds
on
the
back
was
the
form
of
a
cheque
and
this
she
had
filled
up
with
the
same
sum
payable
to
the
bearer
stephen
was
confounded
he
attempted
to
divine
her
motive
considering
how
limited
was
his
knowledge
of
her
later
actions
he
guessed
rather
shrewdly
that
between
the
time
of
her
sending
the
note
in
the
morning
and
the
evening
s
silent
refusal
of
his
gift
something
had
occurred
which
had
caused
a
total
change
in
her
attitude
towards
him
he
knew
not
what
to
do
it
seemed
absurd
now
to
go
to
her
father
next
morning
as
he
had
purposed
and
ask
for
an
engagement
with
her
a
possibility
impending
all
the
while
that
elfride
herself
would
not
be
on
his
side
only
one
course
recommended
itself
as
wise
to
wait
and
see
what
the
days
would
bring
forth
to
go
and
execute
his
commissions
in
birmingham
then
to
return
learn
if
anything
had
happened
and
try
what
a
meeting
might
do
perhaps
her
surprise
at
his
backwardness
would
bring
her
forward
to
show
latent
warmth
as
decidedly
as
in
old
times
this
act
of
patience
was
in
keeping
only
with
the
nature
of
a
man
precisely
of
stephen
s
constitution
nine
men
out
of
ten
would
perhaps
have
rushed
off
got
into
her
presence
by
fair
means
or
foul
and
provoked
a
catastrophe
of
some
sort
possibly
for
the
better
probably
for
the
worse
he
started
for
birmingham
the
next
morning
a
day
s
delay
would
have
made
no
difference
but
he
could
not
rest
until
he
had
begun
and
ended
the
programme
proposed
to
himself
bodily
activity
will
sometimes
take
the
sting
out
of
anxiety
as
completely
as
assurance
itself
chapter
xxv
mine
own
familiar
during
these
days
of
absence
stephen
lived
under
alternate
conditions
whenever
his
emotions
were
active
he
was
in
agony
whenever
he
was
not
in
agony
the
business
in
hand
had
driven
out
of
his
mind
by
sheer
force
all
deep
reflection
on
the
subject
of
elfride
and
love
by
the
time
he
took
his
return
journey
at
the
week
s
end
stephen
had
very
nearly
worked
himself
up
to
an
intention
to
call
and
see
her
face
to
face
on
this
occasion
also
he
adopted
his
favourite
route
by
the
little
summer
steamer
from
bristol
to
castle
boterel
the
time
saved
by
speed
on
the
railway
being
wasted
at
junctions
and
in
following
a
devious
course
it
was
a
bright
silent
evening
at
the
beginning
of
september
when
smith
again
set
foot
in
the
little
town
he
felt
inclined
to
linger
awhile
upon
the
quay
before
ascending
the
hills
having
formed
a
romantic
intention
to
go
home
by
way
of
her
house
yet
not
wishing
to
wander
in
its
neighbourhood
till
the
evening
shades
should
sufficiently
screen
him
from
observation
and
thus
waiting
for
night
s
nearer
approach
he
watched
the
placid
scene
over
which
the
pale
luminosity
of
the
west
cast
a
sorrowful
monochrome
that
became
slowly
embrowned
by
the
dusk
a
star
appeared
and
another
and
another
they
sparkled
amid
the
yards
and
rigging
of
the
two
coal
brigs
lying
alangside
as
if
they
had
been
tiny
lamps
suspended
in
the
ropes
the
masts
rocked
sleepily
to
the
infinitesimal
flux
of
the
tide
which
clucked
and
gurgled
with
idle
regularity
in
nooks
and
holes
of
the
harbour
wall
the
twilight
was
now
quite
pronounced
enough
for
his
purpose
and
as
rather
sad
at
heart
he
was
about
to
move
on
a
little
boat
containing
two
persons
glided
up
the
middle
of
the
harbour
with
the
lightness
of
a
shadow
the
boat
came
opposite
him
passed
on
and
touched
the
at
the
further
end
one
of
its
occupants
was
a
man
as
stephen
had
known
by
the
easy
stroke
of
the
oars
when
the
pair
ascended
the
steps
and
came
into
greater
prominence
he
was
enabled
to
discern
that
the
second
personage
was
a
woman
also
that
she
wore
a
white
decoration
apparently
a
feather
in
her
hat
or
bonnet
which
spot
of
white
was
the
only
distinctly
visible
portion
of
her
clothing
stephen
remained
a
moment
in
their
rear
and
they
passed
on
when
he
pursued
his
way
also
and
soon
forgot
the
circumstance
having
crossed
a
bridge
forsaken
the
high
road
and
entered
the
footpath
which
led
up
the
vale
to
west
endelstow
he
heard
a
little
wicket
click
softly
together
some
yards
ahead
by
the
time
that
stephen
had
reached
the
wicket
and
passed
it
he
heard
another
click
of
precisely
the
same
nature
from
another
gate
yet
further
on
clearly
some
person
or
persons
were
preceding
him
along
the
path
their
footsteps
being
rendered
noiseless
by
the
soft
carpet
of
turf
stephen
now
walked
a
little
quicker
and
perceived
two
forms
one
of
them
bore
aloft
the
white
feather
he
had
noticed
in
the
woman
s
hat
on
the
quay
they
were
the
couple
he
had
seen
in
the
boat
stephen
dropped
a
little
further
to
the
rear
from
the
bottom
of
the
valley
along
which
the
path
had
hitherto
lain
beside
the
margin
of
the
trickling
streamlet
another
path
now
diverged
and
ascended
the
slope
of
the
hill
this
footway
led
only
to
the
residence
of
swancourt
and
a
cottage
or
two
in
its
vicinity
no
grass
covered
this
diverging
path
in
portions
of
its
length
and
stephen
was
reminded
that
the
pair
in
front
of
him
had
taken
this
route
by
the
occasional
rattle
of
loose
stones
under
their
feet
stephen
climbed
in
the
same
direction
but
for
some
undefined
reason
he
trod
more
softly
than
did
those
preceding
him
his
mind
was
unconsciously
in
exercise
upon
whom
the
woman
might
be
whether
a
visitor
to
the
crags
a
servant
or
elfride
he
put
it
to
himself
yet
more
forcibly
could
the
lady
be
elfride
a
possible
reason
for
her
unaccountable
failure
to
keep
the
appointment
with
him
returned
with
painful
force
they
entered
the
grounds
of
the
house
by
the
side
wicket
whence
the
path
now
wide
and
well
trimmed
wound
fantastically
through
the
shrubbery
to
an
octagonal
pavilion
called
the
belvedere
by
reason
of
the
comprehensive
view
over
the
adjacent
district
that
its
green
seats
afforded
the
path
passed
this
erection
and
went
on
to
the
house
as
well
as
to
the
gardener
s
cottage
on
the
other
side
straggling
thence
to
east
endelstow
so
that
stephen
felt
no
hesitation
in
entering
a
promenade
which
could
scarcely
be
called
private
he
fancied
that
he
heard
the
gate
open
and
swing
together
again
behind
him
turning
he
saw
nobody
the
people
of
the
boat
came
to
the
one
of
them
spoke
i
am
afraid
we
shall
get
a
scolding
for
being
so
stephen
instantly
recognised
the
familiar
voice
richer
and
fuller
now
than
it
used
to
be
elfride
he
whispered
to
himself
and
held
fast
by
a
sapling
to
steady
himself
under
the
agitation
her
presence
caused
him
his
heart
swerved
from
its
beat
he
shunned
receiving
the
meaning
he
sought
a
breeze
is
rising
again
how
the
ash
tree
rustles
said
elfride
don
t
you
hear
it
i
wonder
what
the
time
stephen
relinquished
the
sapling
i
will
get
a
light
and
tell
you
step
into
the
the
air
is
quiet
the
cadence
of
that
voice
its
peculiarity
seemed
to
come
home
to
him
like
that
of
some
notes
of
the
northern
birds
on
his
return
to
his
native
clime
as
an
old
natural
thing
renewed
yet
not
particularly
noticed
as
natural
before
that
renewal
they
entered
the
belvedere
in
the
lower
part
it
was
formed
of
close
nailed
crosswise
and
had
openings
in
the
upper
by
way
of
windows
the
scratch
of
a
striking
light
was
heard
and
a
bright
glow
radiated
from
the
interior
of
the
building
the
light
gave
birth
to
dancing
lustrous
streaks
dots
sparkles
and
threads
of
silver
sheen
of
all
imaginable
variety
and
transience
it
awakened
gnats
which
flew
towards
it
revealed
shiny
gossamer
threads
disturbed
earthworms
stephen
gave
but
little
attention
to
these
phenomena
and
less
time
he
saw
in
the
a
strongly
illuminated
picture
first
the
face
of
his
friend
and
preceptor
henry
knight
between
whom
and
himself
an
estrangement
had
arisen
not
from
any
definite
causes
beyond
those
of
absence
increasing
age
and
diverging
sympathies
next
his
bright
particular
star
elfride
the
face
of
elfride
was
more
womanly
than
when
she
had
called
herself
his
but
as
clear
and
healthy
as
ever
her
plenteous
twines
of
beautiful
hair
were
looking
much
as
usual
with
the
exception
of
a
slight
modification
in
their
arrangement
in
deference
to
the
changes
of
fashion
their
two
foreheads
were
close
together
almost
touching
and
both
were
looking
down
elfride
was
holding
her
watch
knight
was
holding
the
light
with
one
hand
his
left
arm
being
round
her
waist
part
of
the
scene
reached
stephen
s
eyes
through
the
horizontal
bars
of
woodwork
which
crossed
their
forms
like
the
ribs
of
a
skeleton
knight
s
arm
stole
still
further
round
the
waist
of
elfride
it
is
eight
she
said
in
a
low
voice
which
had
a
peculiar
music
in
it
seemingly
born
of
a
thrill
of
pleasure
at
the
new
proof
that
she
was
beloved
the
flame
dwindled
down
died
away
and
all
was
wrapped
in
a
darkness
to
which
the
gloom
before
the
illumination
bore
no
comparison
in
apparent
density
stephen
shattered
in
spirit
and
sick
to
his
heart
s
centre
turned
away
in
turning
he
saw
a
shadowy
outline
behind
the
on
the
other
side
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
darkness
was
the
form
a
human
form
or
was
it
an
opaque
bush
of
juniper
the
lovers
arose
brushed
against
the
laurestines
and
pursued
their
way
to
the
house
the
indistinct
figure
had
moved
and
now
passed
across
smith
s
front
so
completely
enveloped
was
the
person
that
it
was
impossible
to
discern
him
or
her
any
more
than
as
a
shape
the
shape
glided
noiselessly
on
stephen
stepped
forward
fearing
any
mischief
was
intended
to
the
other
two
who
are
you
he
said
never
mind
who
i
am
answered
a
weak
whisper
from
the
enveloping
folds
what
i
am
may
she
be
perhaps
i
knew
well
ah
so
well
a
youth
whose
place
you
took
as
he
there
now
takes
yours
will
you
let
her
break
your
heart
and
bring
you
to
an
untimely
grave
as
she
did
the
one
before
you
you
are
jethway
i
think
what
do
you
do
here
and
why
do
you
talk
so
wildly
because
my
heart
is
desolate
and
nobody
cares
about
it
may
hers
be
so
that
brought
trouble
upon
me
silence
said
stephen
staunch
to
elfride
in
spite
of
himself
she
would
harm
nobody
wilfully
never
would
she
how
do
you
come
here
i
saw
the
two
coming
up
the
path
and
wanted
to
learn
if
she
were
not
one
of
them
can
i
help
disliking
her
if
i
think
of
the
past
can
i
help
watching
her
if
i
remember
my
boy
can
i
help
her
if
i
him
the
bowed
form
went
on
passed
through
the
wicket
and
was
enveloped
by
the
shadows
of
the
field
stephen
had
heard
that
jethway
since
the
death
of
her
son
had
become
a
crazed
forlorn
woman
and
bestowing
a
pitying
thought
upon
her
he
dismissed
her
fancied
wrongs
from
his
mind
but
not
her
condemnation
of
elfride
s
faithlessness
that
entered
into
and
mingled
with
the
sensations
his
new
experience
had
begotten
the
tale
told
by
the
little
scene
he
had
witnessed
ran
parallel
with
the
unhappy
woman
s
opinion
which
however
baseless
it
might
have
been
antecedently
had
become
true
enough
as
regarded
himself
a
slow
weight
of
despair
as
distinct
from
a
violent
paroxysm
as
starvation
from
a
mortal
shot
filled
him
and
wrung
him
body
and
soul
the
discovery
had
not
been
altogether
unexpected
for
throughout
his
anxiety
of
the
last
few
days
since
the
night
in
the
churchyard
he
had
been
inclined
to
construe
the
uncertainty
unfavourably
for
himself
his
hopes
for
the
best
had
been
but
periodic
interruptions
to
a
chronic
fear
of
the
worst
a
strange
concomitant
of
his
misery
was
the
singularity
of
its
form
that
his
rival
should
be
knight
whom
once
upon
a
time
he
had
adored
as
a
man
is
very
rarely
adored
by
another
in
modern
times
and
whom
he
loved
now
added
deprecation
to
sorrow
and
cynicism
to
both
henry
knight
whose
praises
he
had
so
frequently
trumpeted
in
her
ears
of
whom
she
had
actually
been
jealous
lest
she
herself
should
be
lessened
in
stephen
s
love
on
account
of
him
had
probably
won
her
the
more
easily
by
reason
of
those
very
praises
which
he
had
only
ceased
to
utter
by
her
command
she
had
ruled
him
like
a
queen
in
that
matter
as
in
all
others
stephen
could
tell
by
her
manner
brief
as
had
been
his
observation
of
it
and
by
her
words
few
as
they
were
that
her
position
was
far
different
with
knight
that
she
looked
up
at
and
adored
her
new
lover
from
below
his
pedestal
was
even
more
perceptible
than
that
she
had
smiled
down
upon
stephen
from
a
height
above
him
the
suddenness
of
elfride
s
renunciation
of
himself
was
food
for
more
torture
to
an
unimpassioned
outsider
it
admitted
of
at
least
two
interpretations
it
might
either
have
proceeded
from
an
endeavour
to
be
faithful
to
her
first
choice
till
the
lover
seen
absolutely
overpowered
the
lover
remembered
or
from
a
wish
not
to
lose
his
love
till
sure
of
the
love
of
another
but
to
stephen
smith
the
motive
involved
in
the
latter
alternative
made
it
untenable
where
elfride
was
the
actor
he
mused
on
her
letters
to
him
in
which
she
had
never
mentioned
a
syllable
concerning
knight
it
is
desirable
however
to
observe
that
only
in
two
letters
could
she
possibly
have
done
so
one
was
written
about
a
week
before
knight
s
arrival
when
though
she
did
not
mention
his
promised
coming
to
stephen
she
had
hardly
a
definite
reason
in
her
mind
for
neglecting
to
do
it
in
the
next
she
did
casually
allude
to
knight
but
stephen
had
left
bombay
long
before
that
letter
arrived
stephen
looked
at
the
black
form
of
the
adjacent
house
where
it
cut
a
dark
polygonal
notch
out
of
the
sky
and
felt
that
he
hated
the
spot
he
did
not
know
many
facts
of
the
case
but
could
not
help
instinctively
associating
elfride
s
fickleness
with
the
marriage
of
her
father
and
their
introduction
to
london
society
he
closed
the
iron
gate
bounding
the
shrubbery
as
noiselessly
as
he
had
opened
it
and
went
into
the
grassy
field
here
he
could
see
the
old
vicarage
the
house
alone
that
was
associated
with
the
sweet
pleasant
time
of
his
incipient
love
for
elfride
turning
sadly
from
the
place
that
was
no
longer
a
nook
in
which
his
thoughts
might
nestle
when
he
was
far
away
he
wandered
in
the
direction
of
the
east
village
to
reach
his
father
s
house
before
they
retired
to
rest
the
nearest
way
to
the
cottage
was
by
crossing
the
park
he
did
not
hurry
happiness
frequently
has
reason
for
haste
but
it
is
seldom
that
desolation
need
scramble
or
strain
sometimes
he
paused
under
the
arms
of
the
trees
looking
vacantly
on
the
ground
stephen
was
standing
thus
scarcely
less
crippled
in
thought
than
he
was
blank
in
vision
when
a
clear
sound
permeated
the
quiet
air
about
him
and
spread
on
far
beyond
the
sound
was
the
stroke
of
a
bell
from
the
tower
of
east
endelstow
church
which
stood
in
a
dell
not
forty
yards
from
lord
luxellian
s
mansion
and
within
the
park
enclosure
another
stroke
greeted
his
ear
and
gave
character
to
both
then
came
a
slow
succession
of
them
somebody
is
dead
he
said
aloud
the
of
an
inhabitant
of
the
eastern
parish
was
being
tolled
an
unusual
feature
in
the
tolling
was
that
it
had
not
been
begun
according
to
the
custom
in
endelstow
and
other
parishes
in
the
neighbourhood
at
every
death
the
sex
and
age
of
the
deceased
were
announced
by
a
system
of
changes
three
times
three
strokes
signified
that
the
departed
one
was
a
man
three
times
two
a
woman
twice
three
a
boy
twice
two
a
girl
the
regular
continuity
of
the
tolling
suggested
that
it
was
the
resumption
rather
than
the
beginning
of
a
knell
the
opening
portion
of
which
stephen
had
not
been
near
enough
to
hear
the
momentary
anxiety
he
had
felt
with
regard
to
his
parents
passed
away
he
had
left
them
in
perfect
health
and
had
any
serious
illness
seized
either
a
communication
would
have
reached
him
ere
this
at
the
same
time
since
his
way
homeward
lay
under
the
churchyard
yews
he
resolved
to
look
into
the
belfry
in
passing
by
and
speak
a
word
to
martin
cannister
who
would
be
there
stephen
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
felt
inclined
to
renounce
his
idea
his
mood
was
such
that
talking
to
any
person
to
whom
he
could
not
unburden
himself
would
be
wearisome
however
before
he
could
put
any
inclination
into
effect
the
young
man
saw
from
amid
the
trees
a
bright
light
shining
the
rays
from
which
radiated
like
needles
through
the
sad
plumy
foliage
of
the
yews
its
direction
was
from
the
centre
of
the
churchyard
stephen
mechanically
went
forward
never
could
there
be
a
greater
contrast
between
two
places
of
like
purpose
than
between
this
graveyard
and
that
of
the
further
village
here
the
grass
was
carefully
tended
and
formed
virtually
a
part
of
the
lawn
flowers
and
shrubs
being
planted
indiscriminately
over
both
whilst
the
few
graves
visible
were
mathematically
exact
in
shape
and
smoothness
appearing
in
the
daytime
like
chins
newly
shaven
there
was
no
wall
the
division
between
god
s
acre
and
lord
luxellian
s
being
marked
only
by
a
few
square
stones
set
at
equidistant
points
among
those
persons
who
have
romantic
sentiments
on
the
subject
of
their
last
probably
the
greater
number
would
have
chosen
such
a
spot
as
this
in
preference
to
any
other
a
few
would
have
fancied
a
constraint
in
its
trim
neatness
and
would
have
preferred
the
wild
of
the
neighbouring
site
with
nature
in
her
most
negligent
attire
the
light
in
the
churchyard
he
next
discovered
to
have
its
source
in
a
point
very
near
the
ground
and
stephen
imagined
it
might
come
from
a
lantern
in
the
interior
of
a
grave
but
a
nearer
approach
showed
him
that
its
position
was
immediately
under
the
wall
of
the
aisle
and
within
the
mouth
of
an
archway
he
could
now
hear
voices
and
the
truth
of
the
whole
matter
began
to
dawn
upon
him
walking
on
towards
the
opening
smith
discerned
on
his
left
hand
a
heap
of
earth
and
before
him
a
flight
of
stone
steps
which
the
removed
earth
had
uncovered
leading
down
under
the
edifice
it
was
the
entrance
to
a
large
family
vault
extending
under
the
north
aisle
stephen
had
never
before
seen
it
open
and
descending
one
or
two
steps
stooped
to
look
under
the
arch
the
vault
appeared
to
be
crowded
with
coffins
with
the
exception
of
an
open
central
space
which
had
been
necessarily
kept
free
for
ingress
and
access
to
the
sides
round
three
of
which
the
coffins
were
stacked
in
stone
bins
or
niches
the
place
was
well
lighted
with
candles
stuck
in
slips
of
wood
that
were
fastened
to
the
wall
on
making
the
descent
of
another
step
the
living
inhabitants
of
the
vault
were
recognizable
they
were
his
father
the
an
martin
cannister
and
two
or
three
young
and
old
crowbars
and
workmen
s
hammers
were
scattered
about
the
whole
company
sitting
round
on
coffins
which
had
been
removed
from
their
places
apparently
for
some
alteration
or
enlargement
of
the
vault
were
eating
bread
and
cheese
and
drinking
ale
from
a
cup
with
two
handles
passed
round
from
each
to
each
who
is
dead
stephen
inquired
stepping
down
chapter
xxvi
to
that
last
nothing
under
all
eyes
were
turned
to
the
entrance
as
stephen
spoke
and
the
conclave
scrutinized
him
inquiringly
why
tis
our
stephen
said
his
father
rising
from
his
seat
and
still
retaining
the
frothy
mug
in
his
left
hand
he
swung
forward
his
right
for
a
grasp
your
mother
is
expecting
ye
thought
you
would
have
come
afore
dark
but
you
ll
wait
and
go
home
with
me
i
have
all
but
done
for
the
day
and
was
going
yes
tis
master
stephy
sure
enough
glad
to
see
you
so
soon
again
master
smith
said
martin
cannister
chastening
the
gladness
expressed
in
his
words
by
a
strict
neutrality
of
countenance
in
order
to
harmonize
the
feeling
as
much
as
possible
with
the
solemnity
of
a
family
vault
the
same
to
you
martin
and
you
william
said
stephen
nodding
around
to
the
rest
who
having
their
mouths
full
of
bread
and
cheese
were
of
necessity
compelled
to
reply
merely
by
compressing
their
eyes
to
friendly
lines
and
wrinkles
and
who
is
dead
stephen
repeated
lady
luxellian
poor
gentlewoman
as
we
all
shall
said
the
ay
and
we
be
going
to
enlarge
the
vault
to
make
room
for
when
did
she
die
early
this
morning
his
father
replied
with
an
appearance
of
recurring
to
a
chronic
thought
yes
this
morning
martin
hev
been
tolling
ever
since
almost
there
twas
expected
she
was
very
ay
poor
soul
this
morning
resumed
the
a
marvellously
old
man
whose
skin
seemed
so
much
too
large
for
his
body
that
it
would
not
stay
in
position
she
must
know
by
this
time
whether
she
s
to
go
up
or
down
poor
what
was
her
age
not
more
than
seven
or
eight
and
twenty
by
candlelight
but
lord
by
day
a
was
forty
if
a
were
an
ay
or
makes
a
difference
of
twenty
years
to
rich
feymels
observed
martin
she
was
one
and
thirty
really
said
john
smith
i
had
it
from
them
that
not
more
than
that
a
looked
very
bad
poor
lady
in
faith
ye
might
say
she
was
dead
for
years
afore
a
would
own
as
my
old
father
used
to
say
dead
but
wouldn
t
drop
i
seed
her
poor
soul
said
a
labourer
from
behind
some
removed
coffins
only
but
last
valentine
of
all
the
world
a
was
arm
in
crook
wi
my
lord
i
says
to
myself
you
be
ticketed
churchyard
my
noble
lady
although
you
don
t
dream
on
i
suppose
my
lord
will
write
to
all
the
other
lords
anointed
in
the
nation
to
let
em
know
that
she
that
was
is
now
no
more
tis
done
and
past
i
see
a
bundle
of
letters
go
off
an
hour
after
the
death
sich
wonderful
black
rims
as
they
letters
had
wide
at
the
very
too
much
observed
martin
in
short
tis
out
of
the
question
that
a
human
being
can
be
so
mournful
as
black
edges
wide
i
m
sure
people
don
t
feel
more
than
a
very
narrow
border
when
they
feels
most
of
and
there
are
two
little
girls
are
there
not
said
stephen
nice
clane
little
faces
left
motherless
they
used
to
come
to
parson
swancourt
s
to
play
with
miss
elfride
when
i
were
there
said
william
worm
ah
they
did
so
s
the
latter
sentence
was
introduced
to
add
the
necessary
melancholy
to
a
remark
which
intrinsically
could
hardly
be
made
to
possess
enough
for
the
occasion
yes
continued
worm
they
d
run
upstairs
they
d
run
down
flitting
about
with
her
everywhere
very
fond
of
her
they
were
ah
well
fonder
than
ever
they
were
of
their
mother
so
tis
said
here
and
there
added
a
labourer
well
you
see
tis
natural
lady
luxellian
stood
aloof
from
em
so
was
so
that
they
couldn
t
love
her
in
the
way
children
want
to
like
folks
only
last
winter
i
seed
miss
elfride
talking
to
my
lady
and
the
two
children
and
miss
elfride
wiped
their
noses
for
em
so
careful
my
lady
never
once
seeing
that
it
wanted
doing
and
naturally
children
take
to
people
that
s
their
best
be
as
twill
the
woman
is
dead
and
gone
and
we
must
make
a
place
for
her
said
john
come
lads
drink
up
your
ale
and
we
ll
just
rid
this
corner
so
as
to
have
all
clear
for
beginning
at
the
wall
as
soon
as
tis
light
stephen
then
asked
where
lady
luxellian
was
to
lie
here
said
his
father
we
are
going
to
set
back
this
wall
and
make
a
recess
and
tis
enough
for
us
to
do
before
the
funeral
when
my
lord
s
mother
died
she
said
john
the
place
must
be
enlarged
before
another
can
be
put
but
a
never
expected
twould
be
wanted
so
soon
better
move
lord
george
first
i
suppose
simeon
he
pointed
with
his
foot
to
a
heavy
coffin
covered
with
what
had
originally
been
red
velvet
the
colour
of
which
could
only
just
be
distinguished
now
just
as
ye
think
best
master
john
replied
the
shrivelled
mason
ah
poor
lord
george
he
continued
looking
contemplatively
at
the
huge
coffin
he
and
i
were
as
bitter
enemies
once
as
any
could
be
when
one
is
a
lord
and
t
other
only
a
mortal
man
poor
fellow
he
d
clap
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
cuss
me
as
familial
and
neighbourly
as
if
he
d
been
a
common
chap
ay
a
cussed
me
up
hill
and
a
cussed
me
down
and
then
a
would
rave
out
again
and
the
goold
clamps
of
his
fine
new
teeth
would
glisten
in
the
sun
like
fetters
of
brass
while
i
being
a
small
man
and
poor
was
fain
to
say
nothing
at
all
such
a
strappen
fine
gentleman
as
he
was
too
yes
i
rather
liked
en
sometimes
but
once
now
and
then
when
i
looked
at
his
towering
height
i
d
think
in
my
inside
what
a
weight
you
ll
be
my
lord
for
our
arms
to
lower
under
the
aisle
of
endelstow
church
some
day
and
was
he
inquired
a
young
labourer
he
was
he
was
five
hundredweight
if
a
were
a
pound
what
with
his
lead
and
his
oak
and
his
handles
and
his
one
thing
and
t
other
here
the
ancient
man
slapped
his
hand
upon
the
cover
with
a
force
that
caused
a
rattle
among
the
bones
inside
he
half
broke
my
back
when
i
took
his
feet
to
lower
en
down
the
steps
there
ah
saith
i
to
john
there
didn
t
i
john
that
ever
one
man
s
glory
should
be
such
a
weight
upon
another
man
but
there
i
liked
my
lord
george
tis
a
strange
thought
said
another
that
while
they
be
all
here
under
one
roof
a
snug
united
family
o
luxellians
they
be
really
scattered
miles
away
from
one
another
in
the
form
of
good
sheep
and
wicked
goats
isn
t
it
true
tis
a
thought
to
look
and
that
one
if
he
s
gone
upward
don
t
know
what
his
wife
is
doing
no
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
if
she
s
gone
downward
and
that
some
unfortunate
one
in
the
hot
place
is
across
to
a
lucky
one
up
in
the
clouds
and
quite
forgetting
their
bodies
be
boxed
close
together
all
the
ay
tis
a
thought
to
look
at
too
that
i
can
say
hullo
close
to
fiery
lord
george
and
a
can
t
hear
and
that
i
be
eating
my
onion
close
to
dainty
lady
jane
s
nose
and
she
can
t
smell
what
do
em
put
all
their
heads
one
way
for
inquired
a
young
man
because
tis
churchyard
law
you
simple
the
law
of
the
living
is
that
a
man
shall
be
upright
and
and
the
law
of
the
dead
is
that
a
man
shall
be
east
and
west
every
state
of
society
have
its
we
must
break
the
law
wi
a
few
of
the
poor
souls
however
come
buckle
to
said
the
and
they
set
to
work
anew
the
order
of
interment
could
be
distinctly
traced
by
observing
the
appearance
of
the
coffins
as
they
lay
piled
around
on
those
which
had
been
standing
there
but
a
generation
or
two
the
trappings
still
remained
those
of
an
earlier
period
showed
bare
wood
with
a
few
tattered
rags
dangling
therefrom
earlier
still
the
wood
lay
in
fragments
on
the
floor
of
the
niche
and
the
coffin
consisted
of
naked
lead
alone
whilst
in
the
case
of
the
very
oldest
even
the
lead
was
bulging
and
cracking
in
pieces
revealing
to
the
curious
eye
a
heap
of
dust
within
the
shields
upon
many
were
quite
loose
and
removable
by
the
hand
their
lustreless
surfaces
still
indistinctly
exhibiting
the
name
and
title
of
the
deceased
overhead
the
groins
and
concavities
of
the
arches
curved
in
all
directions
dropping
low
towards
the
walls
where
the
height
was
no
more
than
sufficient
to
enable
a
person
to
stand
upright
the
body
of
george
the
fourteenth
baron
together
with
two
or
three
others
all
of
more
recent
date
than
the
great
bulk
of
coffins
piled
there
had
for
want
of
room
been
placed
at
the
end
of
the
vault
on
tressels
and
not
in
niches
like
the
others
these
it
was
necessary
to
remove
to
form
behind
them
the
chamber
in
which
they
were
ultimately
to
be
deposited
stephen
finding
the
place
and
proceedings
in
keeping
with
the
sombre
colours
of
his
mind
waited
there
still
simeon
i
suppose
you
can
mind
poor
lady
elfride
and
how
she
ran
away
with
the
actor
said
john
smith
after
awhile
i
think
it
fell
upon
the
time
my
father
was
sexton
here
let
us
see
where
is
she
here
somewhere
returned
simeon
looking
round
him
why
i
ve
got
my
arms
round
the
very
gentlewoman
at
this
he
lowered
the
end
of
the
coffin
he
was
holding
wiped
his
face
and
throwing
a
morsel
of
rotten
wood
upon
another
as
an
indicator
continued
that
s
her
husband
there
they
was
as
fair
a
couple
as
you
should
see
anywhere
round
about
and
a
pair
likewise
ay
i
can
mind
it
though
i
was
but
a
chiel
at
the
time
she
fell
in
love
with
this
young
man
of
hers
and
their
banns
were
asked
in
some
church
in
london
and
the
old
lord
her
father
actually
heard
em
asked
the
three
times
and
didn
t
notice
her
name
being
gabbled
on
wi
a
host
of
others
when
she
had
married
she
told
her
father
and
a
fleed
into
a
monstrous
rage
and
said
she
shouldn
hae
a
farthing
lady
elfride
said
she
didn
t
think
of
wishing
it
if
he
d
forgie
her
twas
all
she
asked
and
as
for
a
living
she
was
content
to
play
plays
with
her
husband
this
frightened
the
old
lord
and
a
gie
d
em
a
house
to
live
in
and
a
great
garden
and
a
little
field
or
two
and
a
carriage
and
a
good
few
guineas
well
the
poor
thing
died
at
her
first
gossiping
and
her
husband
who
was
as
a
man
as
ever
eat
meat
and
would
have
died
for
her
went
wild
in
his
mind
and
broke
his
heart
so
twas
said
anyhow
they
were
buried
the
same
day
father
and
mother
but
the
baby
lived
ay
my
lord
s
family
made
much
of
that
man
then
and
put
him
here
with
his
wife
and
there
in
the
corner
the
man
is
now
the
sunday
after
there
was
a
funeral
sermon
the
text
was
or
ever
the
silver
cord
be
loosed
or
the
golden
bowl
be
broken
and
when
twas
preaching
the
men
drew
their
hands
across
their
eyes
several
times
and
every
woman
cried
out
and
what
became
of
the
baby
said
stephen
who
had
frequently
heard
portions
of
the
story
she
was
brought
up
by
her
grandmother
and
a
pretty
maid
she
were
and
she
must
needs
run
away
with
the
curate
parson
swancourt
that
is
now
then
her
grandmother
died
and
the
title
and
everything
went
away
to
another
branch
of
the
family
altogether
parson
swancourt
wasted
a
good
deal
of
his
wife
s
money
and
she
left
him
miss
elfride
that
trick
of
running
away
seems
to
be
handed
down
in
families
like
craziness
or
gout
and
they
two
women
be
alike
as
which
two
lady
elfride
and
young
miss
that
s
alive
now
the
same
hair
and
eyes
but
miss
elfride
s
mother
was
darker
a
good
life
s
a
strangle
bubble
ye
see
said
william
worm
musingly
for
if
the
lord
s
anointment
had
descended
upon
women
instead
of
men
miss
elfride
would
be
lord
luxellian
lady
i

but
as
it
is
the
blood
is
run
out
and
she
s
nothing
to
the
luxellian
family
by
law
whatever
she
may
be
by
i
used
to
fancy
said
simeon
when
i
seed
miss
elfride
hugging
the
little
ladyships
that
there
was
a
likeness
but
i
suppose
twas
only
my
dream
for
years
must
have
altered
the
old
family
and
now
we
ll
move
these
two
and
interposed
john
smith
reviving
as
became
a
master
the
spirit
of
labour
which
had
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
being
nearly
vanquished
by
the
spirit
of
chat

want

none

so
the
evening
s
work
was
concluded
and
the
party
drew
from
the
abode
of
the
quiet
dead
closing
the
old
iron
door
and
shooting
the
lock
loudly
into
the
huge
copper
staple

incongruous
act
of
imprisonment

of

much
more
frequently
of
displacement
with
elfride
swancourt
a
powerful
reason
why
the
displacement
should
be
successful
was
that
the
was
a
greater
man
than
the
first
by
the
side
of
the
instructive
and
piquant
snubbings
she
received
from
knight
stephen
s
general
agreeableness
seemed
watery
by
the
side
of
knight
s
spare
stephen
s
continual
outflow
seemed
lackadaisical
she
had
begun
to
sigh
for
somebody
further
on
in
manhood
stephen
was
hardly
enough
of
a
man
perhaps
there
was
a
proneness
to
inconstancy
in
her
nature
a
nature
to
those
who
contemplate
it
from
a
standpoint
beyond
the
influence
of
that
inconstancy
the
most
exquisite
of
all
in
its
plasticity
and
ready
sympathies
partly
too
stephen
s
failure
to
make
his
hold
on
her
heart
a
permanent
one
was
his
too
timid
habit
of
dispraising
himself
beside
her
a
peculiarity
which
exercised
towards
sensible
men
stirs
a
kindly
chord
of
attachment
that
a
marked
assertiveness
would
leave
untouched
but
inevitably
leads
the
most
sensible
woman
in
the
world
to
undervalue
him
who
practises
it
directly
domineering
ceases
in
the
man
snubbing
begins
in
the
woman
the
trite
but
no
less
unfortunate
fact
being
that
the
gentler
creature
rarely
has
the
capacity
to
appreciate
fair
treatment
from
her
natural
complement
the
abiding
perception
of
the
position
of
stephen
s
parents
had
of
course
a
little
to
do
with
elfride
s
renunciation
to
such
girls
poverty
may
not
be
as
to
the
more
worldly
masses
of
humanity
a
sin
in
itself
but
it
is
a
sin
because
graceful
and
dainty
manners
seldom
exist
in
such
an
atmosphere
few
women
of
old
family
can
be
thoroughly
taught
that
a
fine
soul
may
wear
a
and
an
admittedly
common
man
in
one
is
but
a
worm
in
their
eyes
john
smith
s
rough
hands
and
clothes
his
wife
s
dialect
the
necessary
narrowness
of
their
ways
being
constantly
under
elfride
s
notice
were
not
without
their
deflecting
influence
on
reaching
home
after
the
perilous
adventure
by
the
knight
had
felt
unwell
and
retired
almost
immediately
the
young
lady
who
had
so
materially
assisted
him
had
done
the
same
but
she
reappeared
properly
clothed
about
five
o
clock
she
wandered
restlessly
about
the
house
but
not
on
account
of
their
joint
narrow
escape
from
death
the
storm
which
had
torn
the
tree
had
merely
bowed
the
reed
and
with
the
deliverance
of
knight
all
deep
thought
of
the
accident
had
left
her
the
mutual
avowal
which
it
had
been
the
means
of
precipitating
occupied
a
far
longer
length
of
her
meditations
elfride
s
disquiet
now
was
on
account
of
that
miserable
promise
to
meet
stephen
which
returned
like
a
spectre
again
and
again
the
perception
of
his
littleness
beside
knight
grew
upon
her
alarmingly
she
now
thought
how
sound
had
been
her
father
s
advice
to
her
to
give
him
up
and
was
as
passionately
desirous
of
following
it
as
she
had
hitherto
been
averse
perhaps
there
is
nothing
more
hardening
to
the
tone
of
young
minds
than
thus
to
discover
how
their
dearest
and
strongest
wishes
become
gradually
attuned
by
time
the
cynic
to
the
very
note
of
some
selfish
policy
which
in
earlier
days
they
despised
the
hour
of
appointment
came
and
with
it
a
crisis
and
with
the
crisis
a
collapse
god
forgive
me
i
can
t
meet
stephen
she
exclaimed
to
herself
i
don
t
love
him
less
but
i
love
knight
more
yes
she
would
save
herself
from
a
man
not
fit
for
her
in
spite
of
vows
she
would
obey
her
father
and
have
no
more
to
do
with
stephen
smith
thus
the
fickle
resolve
showed
signs
of
assuming
the
complexion
of
a
virtue
the
following
days
were
passed
without
any
definite
avowal
from
knight
s
lips
such
solitary
walks
and
scenes
as
that
witnessed
by
smith
in
the
were
frequent
but
he
courted
her
so
intangibly
that
to
any
but
such
a
delicate
perception
as
elfride
s
it
would
have
appeared
no
courtship
at
all
the
time
now
really
began
to
be
sweet
with
her
she
dismissed
the
sense
of
sin
in
her
past
actions
and
was
automatic
in
the
intoxication
of
the
moment
the
fact
that
knight
made
no
actual
declaration
was
no
drawback
knowing
since
the
betrayal
of
his
sentiments
that
love
for
her
really
existed
she
preferred
it
for
the
present
in
its
form
of
essence
and
was
willing
to
avoid
for
awhile
the
grosser
medium
of
words
their
feelings
having
been
forced
to
a
rather
premature
demonstration
a
reaction
was
indulged
in
by
both
but
no
sooner
had
she
got
rid
of
her
troubled
conscience
on
the
matter
of
faithlessness
than
a
new
anxiety
confronted
her
it
was
lest
knight
should
accidentally
meet
stephen
in
the
parish
and
that
herself
should
be
the
subject
of
discourse
elfride
learning
knight
more
thoroughly
perceived
that
far
from
having
a
notion
of
stephen
s
precedence
he
had
no
idea
that
she
had
ever
been
wooed
before
by
anybody
on
ordinary
occasions
she
had
a
tongue
so
frank
as
to
show
her
whole
mind
and
a
mind
so
straightforward
as
to
reveal
her
heart
to
its
innermost
shrine
but
the
time
for
a
change
had
come
she
never
alluded
to
even
a
knowledge
of
knight
s
friend
when
women
are
secret
they
are
secret
indeed
and
more
often
than
not
they
only
begin
to
be
secret
with
the
advent
of
a
second
lover
the
elopement
was
now
a
spectre
worse
than
the
first
and
like
the
spirit
in
glenfinlas
it
waxed
taller
with
every
attempt
to
lay
it
her
natural
honesty
invited
her
to
confide
in
knight
and
trust
to
his
generosity
for
forgiveness
she
knew
also
that
as
mere
policy
it
would
be
better
to
tell
him
early
if
he
was
to
be
told
at
all
the
longer
her
concealment
the
more
difficult
would
be
the
revelation
but
she
put
it
off
the
intense
fear
which
accompanies
intense
love
in
young
women
was
too
strong
to
allow
the
exercise
of
a
moral
quality
antagonistic
to
itself
where
love
is
great
the
littlest
doubts
are
fear
where
little
fears
grow
great
great
love
grows
the
match
was
looked
upon
as
made
by
her
father
and
mother
the
vicar
remembered
her
promise
to
reveal
the
meaning
of
the
telegram
she
had
received
and
two
days
after
the
scene
in
the
asked
her
pointedly
she
was
frank
with
him
now
i
had
been
corresponding
with
stephen
smith
ever
since
he
left
england
till
lately
she
calmly
said
what
cried
the
vicar
aghast
under
the
eyes
of
knight
too
no
when
i
found
i
cared
most
for
knight
i
obeyed
you
were
very
kind
i
m
sure
when
did
you
begin
to
like
knight
i
don
t
see
that
that
is
a
pertinent
question
papa
the
telegram
was
from
the
shipping
agent
and
was
not
sent
at
my
request
it
announced
the
arrival
of
the
vessel
bringing
him
home
what
is
he
here
yes
in
the
village
i
has
he
tried
to
see
you
only
by
fair
means
but
don
t
papa
question
me
so
it
is
i
will
only
say
one
word
more
he
replied
have
you
met
him
i
have
not
i
can
assure
you
that
at
the
present
moment
there
is
no
more
of
an
understanding
between
me
and
the
young
man
you
so
much
disliked
than
between
him
and
you
you
told
me
to
forget
him
and
i
have
forgotten
oh
well
though
you
did
not
obey
me
in
the
beginning
you
are
a
good
girl
elfride
in
obeying
me
at
don
t
call
me
good
papa
she
said
bitterly
you
don
t
know
and
the
less
said
about
some
things
the
better
remember
knight
knows
nothing
about
the
other
oh
how
wrong
it
all
is
i
don
t
know
what
i
am
coming
as
matters
stand
i
should
be
inclined
to
tell
him
or
at
any
rate
i
should
not
alarm
myself
about
his
knowing
he
found
out
the
other
day
that
this
was
the
parish
young
smith
s
father
lives
in
what
puts
you
in
such
a
flurry
i
can
t
say
but
promise
pray
don
t
let
him
know
it
would
be
my
ruin
pooh
child
knight
is
a
good
fellow
and
a
clever
man
but
at
the
same
time
it
does
not
escape
my
perceptions
that
he
is
no
great
catch
for
you
men
of
his
turn
of
mind
are
nothing
so
wonderful
in
the
way
of
husbands
if
you
had
chosen
to
wait
you
might
have
mated
with
a
much
wealthier
man
but
remember
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
your
having
him
if
you
like
him
charlotte
is
delighted
as
you
well
papa
she
said
smiling
hopefully
through
a
sigh
it
is
nice
to
feel
that
in
giving
way
to
to
caring
for
him
i
have
pleased
my
family
but
i
am
not
good
oh
no
i
am
very
far
from
that
none
of
us
are
good
i
am
sorry
to
say
said
her
father
blandly
but
girls
have
a
chartered
right
to
change
their
minds
you
know
it
has
been
recognized
by
poets
from
time
immemorial
catullus
says
mulier
cupido
quod
dicit
amanti
in
vento
what
a
memory
mine
is
however
the
passage
is
that
a
woman
s
words
to
a
lover
are
as
a
matter
of
course
written
only
on
wind
and
water
now
don
t
be
troubled
about
that
ah
you
don
t
know
they
had
been
standing
on
the
lawn
and
knight
was
now
seen
lingering
some
way
down
a
winding
walk
when
elfride
met
him
it
was
with
a
much
greater
lightness
of
heart
things
were
more
straightforward
now
the
responsibility
of
her
fickleness
seemed
partly
shifted
from
her
own
shoulders
to
her
father
s
still
there
were
shadows
ah
could
he
have
known
how
far
i
went
with
stephen
and
yet
have
said
the
same
how
much
happier
i
should
be
that
was
her
prevailing
thought
in
the
afternoon
the
lovers
went
out
together
on
horseback
for
an
hour
or
two
and
though
not
wishing
to
be
observed
by
reason
of
the
late
death
of
lady
luxellian
whose
funeral
had
taken
place
very
privately
on
the
previous
day
they
yet
found
it
necessary
to
pass
east
endelstow
church
the
steps
to
the
vault
as
has
been
stated
were
on
the
outside
of
the
building
immediately
under
the
aisle
wall
being
on
horseback
both
knight
and
elfride
could
overlook
the
shrubs
which
screened
the
look
the
vault
seems
still
to
be
open
said
knight
yes
it
is
open
she
answered
who
is
that
man
close
by
it
the
mason
i
suppose
i
wonder
if
it
is
john
smith
stephen
s
father
i
believe
it
is
said
elfride
with
apprehension
ah
and
can
it
be
i
should
like
to
inquire
how
his
son
my
truant
protege
is
going
on
and
from
your
father
s
description
of
the
vault
the
interior
must
be
interesting
suppose
we
go
had
we
better
do
you
think
may
not
lord
luxellian
be
there
it
is
not
at
all
elfride
then
assented
since
she
could
do
nothing
else
her
heart
which
at
first
had
quailed
in
consternation
recovered
itself
when
she
considered
the
character
of
john
smith
a
quiet
unassuming
man
he
would
be
sure
to
act
towards
her
as
before
those
love
passages
with
his
son
which
might
have
given
a
more
pretentious
mechanic
airs
so
without
much
alarm
she
took
knight
s
arm
after
dismounting
and
went
with
him
between
and
over
the
graves
the
recognized
her
as
she
approached
and
as
usual
lifted
his
hat
respectfully
i
know
you
to
be
smith
my
former
friend
stephen
s
father
said
knight
directly
he
had
scanned
the
embrowned
and
ruddy
features
of
john
yes
sir
i
b
lieve
i
how
is
your
son
now
i
have
only
once
heard
from
him
since
he
went
to
india
i
daresay
you
have
heard
him
speak
of
me
knight
who
became
acquainted
with
him
some
years
ago
in
ay
that
i
have
stephen
is
very
well
thank
you
sir
and
he
s
in
england
in
fact
he
s
at
home
in
short
sir
he
s
down
in
the
vault
there
at
the
departed
elfride
s
heart
fluttered
like
a
butterfly
knight
looked
amazed
well
that
is
he
murmured
did
he
know
i
was
in
the
parish
i
really
can
t
say
sir
said
john
wishing
himself
out
of
the
entanglement
he
rather
suspected
than
thoroughly
understood
would
it
be
considered
an
intrusion
by
the
family
if
we
went
into
the
vault
oh
bless
ye
no
sir
scores
of
folk
have
been
stepping
down
tis
left
open
we
will
go
down
i
am
afraid
the
air
is
close
she
said
appealingly
oh
no
ma
am
said
john
we
the
walls
and
arches
the
day
twas
opened
as
we
always
do
and
again
on
the
morning
of
the
funeral
the
place
is
as
sweet
as
a
granary
then
i
should
like
you
to
accompany
me
elfie
having
originally
sprung
from
the
family
i
don
t
like
going
where
death
is
so
emphatically
present
i
ll
stay
by
the
horses
whilst
you
go
in
they
may
get
what
nonsense
i
had
no
idea
your
sentiments
were
so
flimsily
formed
as
to
be
perturbed
by
a
few
remnants
of
mortality
but
stay
out
if
you
are
so
afraid
by
all
oh
no
i
am
not
afraid
don
t
say
she
held
miserably
to
his
arm
thinking
that
perhaps
the
revelation
might
as
well
come
at
once
as
ten
minutes
later
for
stephen
would
be
sure
to
accompany
his
friend
to
his
horse
at
first
the
gloom
of
the
vault
which
was
lighted
only
by
a
couple
of
candles
was
too
great
to
admit
of
their
seeing
anything
distinctly
but
with
a
further
advance
knight
discerned
in
front
of
the
black
masses
lining
the
walls
a
young
man
standing
and
writing
in
a
knight
said
one
word
stephen
stephen
smith
not
being
in
such
absolute
ignorance
of
knight
s
whereabouts
as
knight
had
been
of
smith
s
instantly
recognized
his
friend
and
knew
by
rote
the
outlines
of
the
fair
woman
standing
behind
him
stephen
came
forward
and
shook
him
by
the
hand
without
speaking
why
have
you
not
written
my
boy
said
knight
without
in
any
way
signifying
elfride
s
presence
to
stephen
to
the
essayist
smith
was
still
the
country
lad
whom
he
had
patronized
and
tended
one
to
whom
the
formal
presentation
of
a
lady
betrothed
to
himself
would
have
seemed
incongruous
and
absurd
why
haven
t
you
written
to
me
said
stephen
ah
yes
why
haven
t
i
why
haven
t
we
that
s
always
the
query
which
we
can
not
clearly
answer
without
an
unsatisfactory
sense
of
our
inadequacies
however
i
have
not
forgotten
you
smith
and
now
we
have
met
and
we
must
meet
again
and
have
a
longer
chat
than
this
can
conveniently
be
i
must
know
all
you
have
been
doing
that
you
have
thriven
i
know
and
you
must
teach
me
the
elfride
stood
in
the
background
stephen
had
read
the
position
at
a
glance
and
immediately
guessed
that
she
had
never
mentioned
his
name
to
knight
his
tact
in
avoiding
catastrophes
was
the
chief
quality
which
made
him
intellectually
respectable
in
which
quality
he
far
transcended
knight
and
he
decided
that
a
tranquil
issue
out
of
the
encounter
without
any
harrowing
of
the
feelings
of
either
knight
or
elfride
was
to
be
attempted
if
possible
his
old
sense
of
indebtedness
to
knight
had
never
wholly
forsaken
him
his
love
for
elfride
was
generous
now
as
far
as
he
dared
look
at
her
movements
he
saw
that
her
bearing
towards
him
would
be
dictated
by
his
own
towards
her
and
if
he
acted
as
a
stranger
she
would
do
likewise
as
a
means
of
deliverance
circumstances
favouring
this
course
it
was
desirable
also
to
be
rather
reserved
towards
knight
to
shorten
the
meeting
as
much
as
possible
i
am
afraid
that
my
time
is
almost
too
short
to
allow
even
of
such
a
pleasure
he
said
i
leave
here
and
until
i
start
for
the
continent
and
india
which
will
be
in
a
fortnight
i
shall
have
hardly
a
moment
to
knight
s
disappointment
and
dissatisfied
looks
at
this
reply
sent
a
pang
through
stephen
as
great
as
any
he
had
felt
at
the
sight
of
elfride
the
words
about
shortness
of
time
were
literally
true
but
their
tone
was
far
from
being
so
he
would
have
been
gratified
to
talk
with
knight
as
in
past
times
and
saw
as
a
dead
loss
to
himself
that
to
save
the
woman
who
cared
nothing
for
him
he
was
deliberately
throwing
away
his
friend
oh
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
said
knight
in
a
changed
tone
but
of
course
if
you
have
weighty
concerns
to
attend
to
they
must
not
be
neglected
and
if
this
is
to
be
our
first
and
last
meeting
let
me
say
that
i
wish
you
success
with
all
my
heart
knight
s
warmth
revived
towards
the
end
the
solemn
impressions
he
was
beginning
to
receive
from
the
scene
around
them
abstracting
from
his
heart
as
a
puerility
any
momentary
vexation
at
words
it
is
a
strange
place
for
us
to
meet
in
he
continued
looking
round
the
vault
stephen
briefly
assented
and
there
was
a
silence
the
blackened
coffins
were
now
revealed
more
clearly
than
at
first
the
whitened
walls
and
arches
throwing
them
forward
in
strong
relief
it
was
a
scene
which
was
remembered
by
all
three
as
an
indelible
mark
in
their
history
knight
with
an
abstracted
face
was
standing
between
his
companions
though
a
little
in
advance
of
them
elfride
being
on
his
right
hand
and
stephen
smith
on
his
left
the
white
daylight
on
his
right
side
gleamed
faintly
in
and
was
toned
to
a
blueness
by
contrast
with
the
yellow
rays
from
the
candle
against
the
wall
elfride
timidly
shrinking
back
and
nearest
the
entrance
received
most
of
the
light
therefrom
whilst
stephen
was
entirely
in
candlelight
and
to
him
the
spot
of
outer
sky
visible
above
the
steps
was
as
a
steely
blue
patch
and
nothing
more
i
have
been
here
two
or
three
times
since
it
was
opened
said
stephen
my
father
was
engaged
in
the
work
you
yes
what
are
you
doing
knight
inquired
looking
at
the
and
pencil
stephen
held
in
his
hand
i
have
been
sketching
a
few
details
in
the
church
and
since
then
i
have
been
copying
the
names
from
some
of
the
coffins
here
before
i
left
england
i
used
to
do
a
good
deal
of
this
sort
of
yes
of
course
ah
that
s
poor
lady
luxellian
i
knight
pointed
to
a
coffin
of
light
which
stood
on
the
stone
sleepers
in
the
new
niche
and
the
remainder
of
the
family
are
on
this
side
who
are
those
two
so
snug
and
close
together
stephen
s
voice
altered
slightly
as
he
replied
that
s
lady
elfride
kingsmore
born
luxellian
and
that
is
arthur
her
husband
i
have
heard
my
father
say
that
they
he
ran
away
with
her
and
married
her
against
the
wish
of
her
then
i
imagine
this
to
be
where
you
got
your
christian
name
miss
swancourt
said
knight
turning
to
her
i
think
you
told
me
it
was
three
or
four
generations
ago
that
your
family
branched
off
from
the
luxellians
she
was
my
grandmother
said
elfride
vainly
endeavouring
to
moisten
her
dry
lips
before
she
spoke
elfride
had
then
the
look
of
guido
s
magdalen
rendered
upon
a
more
childlike
form
she
kept
her
face
partially
away
from
knight
and
stephen
and
set
her
eyes
upon
the
sky
visible
outside
as
if
her
salvation
depended
upon
quickly
reaching
it
her
left
hand
rested
lightly
within
knight
s
arm
half
withdrawn
from
a
sense
of
shame
at
claiming
him
before
her
old
lover
yet
unwilling
to
renounce
him
so
that
her
glove
merely
touched
his
sleeve
can
one
be
pardoned
and
retain
the
offence
quoted
elfride
s
heart
then
conversation
seemed
to
have
no
power
and
went
on
in
the
shape
of
disjointed
remarks
one
s
mind
gets
thronged
with
thoughts
while
standing
so
solemnly
here
knight
said
in
a
measured
quiet
voice
how
much
has
been
said
on
death
from
time
to
time
how
much
we
ourselves
can
think
upon
it
we
may
fancy
each
of
these
who
lie
here
saying
for
thou
to
make
my
fall
more
great
didst
lift
me
up
on
what
comes
next
elfride
it
is
the
psalm
i
am
thinking
yes
i
know
it
she
murmured
and
went
on
in
a
still
lower
voice
seemingly
afraid
for
any
words
from
the
emotional
side
of
her
nature
to
reach
stephen
my
days
just
hastening
to
their
end
are
like
an
evening
shade
my
beauty
doth
like
wither
d
grass
with
waning
lustre
well
said
knight
musingly
let
us
leave
them
such
occasions
as
these
seem
to
compel
us
to
roam
outside
ourselves
far
away
from
the
fragile
frame
we
live
in
and
to
expand
till
our
perception
grows
so
vast
that
our
physical
reality
bears
no
sort
of
proportion
to
it
we
look
back
upon
the
weak
and
minute
stem
on
which
this
luxuriant
growth
depends
and
ask
can
it
be
possible
that
such
a
capacity
has
a
foundation
so
small
must
i
again
return
to
my
daily
walk
in
that
narrow
cell
a
human
body
where
worldly
thoughts
can
torture
me
do
we
not
yes
said
stephen
and
elfride
one
has
a
sense
of
wrong
too
that
such
an
appreciative
breadth
as
a
sentient
being
possesses
should
be
committed
to
the
frail
casket
of
a
body
what
weakens
one
s
intentions
regarding
the
future
like
the
thought
of
this
however
let
us
tune
ourselves
to
a
more
cheerful
chord
for
there
s
a
great
deal
to
be
done
yet
by
us
as
knight
meditatively
addressed
his
juniors
thus
unconscious
of
the
deception
practised
for
different
reasons
by
the
severed
hearts
at
his
side
and
of
the
scenes
that
had
in
earlier
days
united
them
each
one
felt
that
he
and
she
did
not
gain
by
contrast
with
their
musing
mentor
physically
not
so
handsome
as
either
the
youthful
architect
or
the
vicar
s
daughter
the
thoroughness
and
integrity
of
knight
illuminated
his
features
with
a
dignity
not
even
incipient
in
the
other
two
it
is
difficult
to
frame
rules
which
shall
apply
to
both
sexes
and
elfride
an
undeveloped
girl
must
perhaps
hardly
be
laden
with
the
moral
responsibilities
which
attach
to
a
man
in
like
circumstances
the
charm
of
woman
too
lies
partly
in
her
subtleness
in
matters
of
love
but
if
honesty
is
a
virtue
in
itself
elfride
having
none
of
it
now
seemed
being
for
being
scarcely
good
enough
for
knight
stephen
though
deceptive
for
no
unworthy
purpose
was
deceptive
after
all
and
whatever
good
results
grace
such
strategy
if
it
succeed
it
seldom
draws
admiration
especially
when
it
fails
on
an
ordinary
occasion
had
knight
been
even
quite
alone
with
stephen
he
would
hardly
have
alluded
to
his
possible
relationship
to
elfride
but
moved
by
attendant
circumstances
knight
was
impelled
to
be
confiding
stephen
he
said
this
lady
is
miss
swancourt
i
am
staying
at
her
father
s
house
as
you
probably
he
stepped
a
few
paces
nearer
to
smith
and
said
in
a
lower
tone
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
we
are
engaged
to
be
low
as
the
words
had
been
spoken
elfride
had
heard
them
and
awaited
stephen
s
reply
in
breathless
silence
if
that
could
be
called
silence
where
elfride
s
dress
at
each
throb
of
her
heart
shook
and
indicated
it
like
a
rustling
also
against
the
wall
in
reply
to
the
same
throbbing
the
ray
of
daylight
which
reached
her
face
lent
it
a
blue
pallor
in
comparison
with
those
of
the
other
two
i
congratulate
you
stephen
whispered
and
said
aloud
i
know
miss
swancourt
a
little
you
must
remember
that
my
father
is
a
parishioner
of
swancourt
i
thought
you
might
possibly
not
have
lived
at
home
since
they
have
been
i
have
never
lived
at
home
certainly
since
that
i
have
seen
smith
faltered
elfride
well
there
is
no
excuse
for
me
as
strangers
to
each
other
i
ought
i
suppose
to
have
introduced
you
as
acquaintances
i
should
not
have
stood
so
persistently
between
you
but
the
fact
is
smith
you
seem
a
boy
to
me
even
stephen
appeared
to
have
a
more
than
previous
consciousness
of
the
intense
cruelty
of
his
fate
at
the
present
moment
he
could
not
repress
the
words
uttered
with
a
dim
bitterness
you
should
have
said
that
i
seemed
still
the
rural
mechanic
s
son
i
am
and
hence
an
unfit
subject
for
the
ceremony
of
oh
no
no
i
won
t
have
knight
endeavoured
to
give
his
reply
a
laughing
tone
in
elfride
s
ears
and
an
earnestness
in
stephen
s
in
both
which
efforts
he
signally
failed
and
produced
a
forced
speech
pleasant
to
neither
well
let
us
go
into
the
open
air
again
miss
swancourt
you
are
particularly
silent
you
mustn
t
mind
smith
i
have
known
him
for
years
as
i
have
told
yes
you
have
she
said
to
think
she
has
never
mentioned
her
knowledge
of
me
smith
murmured
and
thought
with
some
remorse
how
much
her
conduct
resembled
his
own
on
his
first
arrival
at
her
house
as
a
stranger
to
the
place
they
ascended
to
the
daylight
knight
taking
no
further
notice
of
elfride
s
manner
which
as
usual
he
attributed
to
the
natural
shyness
of
a
young
woman
at
being
discovered
walking
with
him
on
terms
which
left
not
much
doubt
of
their
meaning
elfride
stepped
a
little
in
advance
and
passed
through
the
churchyard
you
are
changed
very
considerably
smith
said
knight
and
i
suppose
it
is
no
more
than
was
to
be
expected
however
don
t
imagine
that
i
shall
feel
any
the
less
interest
in
you
and
your
fortunes
whenever
you
care
to
confide
them
to
me
i
have
not
forgotten
the
attachment
you
spoke
of
as
your
reason
for
going
away
to
india
a
london
young
lady
was
it
not
i
hope
all
is
prosperous
no
the
match
is
broken
it
being
always
difficult
to
know
whether
to
express
sorrow
or
gladness
under
such
circumstances
all
depending
upon
the
character
of
the
match
knight
took
shelter
in
the
safe
words
i
trust
it
was
for
the
i
hope
it
was
but
i
beg
that
you
will
not
press
me
further
no
you
have
not
pressed
me
i
don
t
mean
that
but
i
would
rather
not
speak
upon
the
stephen
s
words
were
hurried
knight
said
no
more
and
they
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
elfride
who
still
kept
some
paces
in
advance
and
had
not
heard
knight
s
unconscious
allusion
to
her
stephen
bade
him
adieu
at
the
without
going
outside
and
watched
whilst
he
and
his
sweetheart
mounted
their
horses
good
heavens
elfride
knight
exclaimed
how
pale
you
are
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
have
taken
you
into
that
vault
what
is
the
matter
nothing
said
elfride
faintly
i
shall
be
myself
in
a
moment
all
was
so
strange
and
unexpected
down
there
that
it
made
me
i
thought
you
said
very
little
shall
i
get
some
water
no
do
you
think
it
is
safe
for
you
to
mount
quite
indeed
it
is
she
said
with
a
look
of
appeal
now
then
up
she
goes
whispered
knight
and
lifted
her
tenderly
into
the
saddle
her
old
lover
still
looked
on
at
the
performance
as
he
leant
over
the
gate
a
dozen
yards
off
once
in
the
saddle
and
having
a
firm
grip
of
the
reins
she
turned
her
head
as
if
by
a
resistless
fascination
and
for
the
first
time
since
that
memorable
parting
on
the
moor
outside
launce
s
after
the
passionate
attempt
at
marriage
with
him
elfride
looked
in
the
face
of
the
young
man
she
first
had
loved
he
was
the
youth
who
had
called
her
his
inseparable
wife
many
a
time
and
whom
she
had
even
addressed
as
her
husband
their
eyes
met
measurement
of
life
should
be
proportioned
rather
to
the
intensity
of
the
experience
than
to
its
actual
length
their
glance
but
a
moment
chronologically
was
a
season
in
their
history
to
elfride
the
intense
agony
of
reproach
in
stephen
s
eye
was
a
nail
piercing
her
heart
with
a
deadliness
no
words
can
describe
with
a
spasmodic
effort
she
withdrew
her
eyes
urged
on
the
horse
and
in
the
chaos
of
perturbed
memories
was
oblivious
of
any
presence
beside
her
the
deed
of
deception
was
complete
gaining
a
knoll
on
which
the
park
transformed
itself
into
wood
and
copse
knight
came
still
closer
to
her
side
and
said
are
you
better
now
dearest
oh
she
pressed
a
hand
to
her
eyes
as
if
to
blot
out
the
image
of
stephen
a
vivid
scarlet
spot
now
shone
with
preternatural
brightness
in
the
centre
of
each
cheek
leaving
the
remainder
of
her
face
as
before
elfride
said
knight
rather
in
his
old
tone
of
mentor
you
know
i
don
t
for
a
moment
chide
you
but
is
there
not
a
great
deal
of
unwomanly
weakness
in
your
allowing
yourself
to
be
so
overwhelmed
by
the
sight
of
what
after
all
is
no
novelty
every
woman
worthy
of
the
name
should
i
think
be
able
to
look
upon
death
with
something
like
composure
surely
you
think
so
too
yes
i
own
his
obtuseness
to
the
cause
of
her
indisposition
by
evidencing
his
entire
freedom
from
the
suspicion
of
anything
behind
the
scenes
showed
how
incapable
knight
was
of
deception
himself
rather
than
any
inherent
dulness
in
him
regarding
human
nature
this
clearly
perceived
by
elfride
added
poignancy
to
her
and
she
idolized
him
the
more
because
of
their
difference
even
the
recent
sight
of
stephen
s
face
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
which
for
a
moment
had
stirred
a
chord
or
two
of
ancient
kindness
were
unable
to
keep
down
the
adoration
now
that
he
was
again
out
of
view
she
had
replied
to
knight
s
question
hastily
and
immediately
went
on
to
speak
of
indifferent
subjects
after
they
had
reached
home
she
was
apart
from
him
till
when
dinner
was
over
and
they
were
watching
the
dusk
in
the
knight
stepped
out
upon
the
terrace
elfride
went
after
him
very
decisively
on
the
spur
of
a
virtuous
intention
mr
knight
i
want
to
tell
you
something
she
said
with
quiet
firmness
and
what
is
it
about
gaily
returned
her
lover
happiness
i
hope
do
not
let
anything
keep
you
so
sad
as
you
seem
to
have
been
i
can
not
mention
the
matter
until
i
tell
you
the
whole
substance
of
it
she
said
and
that
i
will
do
i
have
been
reminded
of
it
it
is
about
something
i
once
did
and
don
t
think
i
ought
to
have
this
it
must
be
said
was
rather
a
mild
way
of
referring
to
a
frantic
passion
and
flight
which
much
or
little
in
itself
only
accident
had
saved
from
being
a
scandal
in
the
public
eye
knight
thought
the
matter
some
trifle
and
said
pleasantly
then
i
am
not
to
hear
the
dreadful
confession
now
no
not
now
i
did
not
mean
elfride
responded
with
a
slight
decline
in
the
firmness
of
her
voice
it
is
not
light
as
you
think
it
it
troubles
me
a
great
fearing
now
the
effect
of
her
own
earnestness
she
added
forcedly
though
perhaps
you
may
think
it
light
after
but
you
have
not
said
when
it
is
to
be
morning
name
a
time
will
you
and
bind
me
to
it
i
want
you
to
fix
an
hour
because
i
am
weak
and
may
otherwise
try
to
get
out
of
she
added
a
little
artificial
laugh
which
showed
how
timorous
her
resolution
was
still
well
say
after
breakfast
at
eleven
o
yes
eleven
o
clock
i
promise
you
bind
me
strictly
to
my
chapter
xxviii
i
lull
a
fancy
miss
swancourt
it
is
eleven
o
she
was
looking
out
of
her
window
on
the
first
floor
and
knight
was
regarding
her
from
the
terrace
balustrade
upon
which
he
had
been
idly
sitting
for
some
time
dividing
the
glances
of
his
eye
between
the
pages
of
a
book
in
his
hand
the
brilliant
hues
of
the
geraniums
and
calceolarias
and
the
open
window
yes
it
is
i
know
i
am
he
drew
closer
and
under
the
window
how
are
you
this
morning
elfride
you
look
no
better
for
your
long
night
s
she
appeared
at
the
door
shortly
after
took
his
offered
arm
and
together
they
walked
slowly
down
the
gravel
path
leading
to
the
river
and
away
under
the
trees
her
resolution
sustained
during
the
last
fifteen
hours
had
been
to
tell
the
whole
truth
and
now
the
moment
had
come
step
by
step
they
advanced
and
still
she
did
not
speak
they
were
nearly
at
the
end
of
the
walk
when
knight
broke
the
silence
well
what
is
the
confession
elfride
she
paused
a
moment
drew
a
long
breath
and
this
is
what
she
said
i
told
you
one
day
or
rather
i
gave
you
to
understand
what
was
not
true
i
fancy
you
thought
me
to
mean
i
was
nineteen
my
next
birthday
but
it
was
my
last
i
was
the
moment
had
been
too
much
for
her
now
that
the
crisis
had
come
no
qualms
of
conscience
no
love
of
honesty
no
yearning
to
make
a
confidence
and
obtain
forgiveness
with
a
kiss
could
string
elfride
up
to
the
venture
her
dread
lest
he
should
be
unforgiving
was
heightened
by
the
thought
of
yesterday
s
artifice
which
might
possibly
add
disgust
to
his
disappointment
the
certainty
of
one
more
day
s
affection
which
she
gained
by
silence
outvalued
the
hope
of
a
perpetuity
combined
with
the
risk
of
all
the
trepidation
caused
by
these
thoughts
on
what
she
had
intended
to
say
shook
so
naturally
the
words
she
did
say
that
knight
never
for
a
moment
suspected
them
to
be
a
last
moment
s
substitution
he
smiled
and
pressed
her
hand
warmly
my
dear
elfie
yes
you
are
now
no
protestation
what
a
winning
little
woman
you
are
to
be
so
absurdly
scrupulous
about
a
mere
iota
really
i
never
once
have
thought
whether
your
nineteenth
year
was
the
last
or
the
present
and
by
george
well
i
may
not
for
it
would
never
do
for
a
staid
fogey
a
dozen
years
older
to
stand
upon
such
a
trifle
as
don
t
praise
me
don
t
praise
me
though
i
prize
it
from
your
lips
i
don
t
deserve
it
but
knight
being
in
an
exceptionally
genial
mood
merely
saw
this
distressful
exclamation
as
modesty
well
he
added
after
a
minute
i
like
you
all
the
better
you
know
for
such
moral
precision
although
i
called
it
he
went
on
with
tender
earnestness
for
elfride
there
is
one
thing
i
do
love
to
see
in
a
woman
that
is
a
soul
truthful
and
clear
as
heaven
s
light
i
could
put
up
with
anything
if
i
had
that
forgive
nothing
if
i
had
it
not
elfride
you
have
such
a
soul
if
ever
woman
had
and
having
it
retain
it
and
don
t
ever
listen
to
the
fashionable
theories
of
the
day
about
a
woman
s
privileges
and
natural
right
to
practise
wiles
depend
upon
it
my
dear
girl
that
a
noble
woman
must
be
as
honest
as
a
noble
man
i
specially
mean
by
honesty
fairness
not
only
in
matters
of
business
and
social
detail
but
in
all
the
delicate
dealings
of
love
to
which
the
licence
given
to
your
sex
particularly
elfride
looked
troublously
at
the
trees
now
let
us
go
on
to
the
river
i
would
if
i
had
a
hat
on
she
said
with
a
sort
of
suppressed
woe
i
will
get
it
for
you
said
knight
very
willing
to
purchase
her
companionship
at
so
cheap
a
price
you
sit
down
there
a
and
he
turned
and
walked
rapidly
back
to
the
house
for
the
article
in
question
elfride
sat
down
upon
one
of
the
rustic
benches
which
adorned
this
portion
of
the
grounds
and
remained
with
her
eyes
upon
the
grass
she
was
induced
to
lift
them
by
hearing
the
brush
of
light
and
irregular
footsteps
hard
by
passing
along
the
path
which
intersected
the
one
she
was
in
and
traversed
the
outer
shrubberies
elfride
beheld
the
farmer
s
widow
jethway
before
she
noticed
elfride
she
paused
to
look
at
the
house
portions
of
which
were
visible
through
the
bushes
elfride
shrinking
back
hoped
the
unpleasant
woman
might
go
on
without
seeing
her
but
jethway
silently
apostrophizing
the
house
with
actions
which
seemed
dictated
by
a
reason
had
discerned
the
girl
and
immediately
came
up
and
stood
in
front
of
her
ah
miss
swancourt
why
did
you
disturb
me
mustn
t
i
trespass
here
you
may
walk
here
if
you
like
jethway
i
do
not
disturb
you
disturb
my
mind
and
my
mind
is
my
whole
life
for
my
boy
is
there
still
and
he
is
gone
from
my
yes
poor
young
man
i
was
sorry
when
he
do
you
know
what
he
died
of
oh
no
no
said
the
widow
that
word
consumption
covers
a
good
deal
he
died
because
you
were
his
own
sweetheart
and
then
proved
false
and
it
killed
him
yes
miss
swancourt
she
said
in
an
excited
whisper
you
killed
my
son
how
can
you
be
so
wicked
and
foolish
replied
elfride
rising
indignantly
but
indignation
was
not
natural
to
her
and
having
been
so
worn
and
harrowed
by
late
events
she
lost
any
powers
of
defence
that
mood
might
have
lent
her
i
could
not
help
his
loving
me
jethway
that
s
just
what
you
could
have
helped
you
know
how
it
began
miss
elfride
yes
you
said
you
liked
the
name
of
felix
better
than
any
other
name
in
the
parish
and
you
knew
it
was
his
name
and
that
those
you
said
it
to
would
report
it
to
i
knew
it
was
his
name
of
course
i
did
but
i
am
sure
jethway
i
did
not
intend
anybody
to
tell
but
you
knew
they
no
i
didn
and
then
after
that
when
you
were
riding
on
by
our
house
and
the
lads
were
gathered
there
and
you
wanted
to
dismount
when
jim
drake
and
george
upway
and
three
or
four
more
ran
forward
to
hold
your
pony
and
felix
stood
back
timid
why
did
you
beckon
to
him
and
say
you
would
rather
he
held
it
o
jethway
you
do
think
so
mistakenly
i
liked
him
best
that
s
why
i
wanted
him
to
do
it
he
was
gentle
and
nice
i
always
thought
him
so
and
i
liked
then
why
did
you
let
him
kiss
you
it
is
a
falsehood
oh
it
is
it
is
said
elfride
weeping
with
desperation
he
came
behind
me
and
attempted
to
kiss
me
and
that
was
why
i
told
him
never
to
let
me
see
him
but
you
did
not
tell
your
father
or
anybody
as
you
would
have
if
you
had
looked
upon
it
then
as
the
insult
you
now
pretend
it
he
begged
me
not
to
tell
and
foolishly
enough
i
did
not
and
i
wish
i
had
now
i
little
expected
to
be
scourged
with
my
own
kindness
pray
leave
me
the
girl
only
expostulated
now
well
you
harshly
dismissed
him
and
he
died
and
before
his
body
was
cold
you
took
another
to
your
heart
then
as
carelessly
sent
him
about
his
business
and
took
a
third
and
if
you
consider
that
nothing
miss
swancourt
she
continued
drawing
closer
it
led
on
to
what
was
very
serious
indeed
have
you
forgotten
the
runaway
marriage
the
journey
to
london
and
the
return
the
next
day
without
being
married
and
that
there
s
enough
disgrace
in
that
to
ruin
a
woman
s
good
name
far
less
light
than
yours
you
may
have
i
have
not
fickleness
towards
a
lover
is
bad
but
fickleness
after
playing
the
wife
is
oh
it
s
a
wicked
cruel
lie
do
not
say
it
oh
do
not
does
your
new
man
know
of
it
i
think
not
or
he
would
be
no
man
of
yours
as
much
of
the
story
as
was
known
is
creeping
about
the
neighbourhood
even
now
but
i
know
more
than
any
of
them
and
why
should
i
respect
your
love
i
defy
you
cried
elfride
tempestuously
do
and
say
all
you
can
to
ruin
me
try
put
your
tongue
at
work
i
invite
it
i
defy
you
as
a
slanderous
woman
look
there
he
and
her
voice
trembled
greatly
as
she
saw
through
the
leaves
the
beloved
form
of
knight
coming
from
the
door
with
her
hat
in
his
hand
tell
him
at
once
i
can
bear
not
now
said
the
woman
and
disappeared
down
the
path
the
excitement
of
her
latter
words
had
restored
colour
to
elfride
s
cheeks
and
hastily
wiping
her
eyes
she
walked
farther
on
so
that
by
the
time
her
lover
had
overtaken
her
the
traces
of
emotion
had
nearly
disappeared
from
her
face
knight
put
the
hat
upon
her
head
took
her
hand
and
drew
it
within
his
arm
it
was
the
last
day
but
one
previous
to
their
departure
for
leonards
and
knight
seemed
to
have
a
purpose
in
being
much
in
her
company
that
day
they
rambled
along
the
valley
the
season
was
that
period
in
the
autumn
when
the
foliage
alone
of
an
ordinary
plantation
is
rich
enough
in
hues
to
exhaust
the
chromatic
combinations
of
an
artist
s
palette
most
lustrous
of
all
are
the
beeches
graduating
from
bright
rusty
red
at
the
extremity
of
the
boughs
to
a
bright
yellow
at
their
inner
parts
young
oaks
are
still
of
a
neutral
green
scotch
firs
and
hollies
are
nearly
blue
whilst
occasional
dottings
of
other
varieties
give
maroons
and
purples
of
every
tinge
the
river
such
as
it
was
here
pursued
its
course
amid
flagstones
as
level
as
a
pavement
but
divided
by
crevices
of
irregular
width
with
the
summer
drought
the
torrent
had
narrowed
till
it
was
now
but
a
thread
of
crystal
clearness
meandering
along
a
central
channel
in
the
rocky
bed
of
the
winter
current
knight
scrambled
through
the
bushes
which
at
this
point
nearly
covered
the
brook
from
sight
and
leapt
down
upon
the
dry
portion
of
the
river
bottom
elfride
i
never
saw
such
a
sight
he
exclaimed
the
hazels
overhang
the
river
s
course
in
a
perfect
arch
and
the
floor
is
beautifully
paved
the
place
reminds
one
of
the
passages
of
a
cloister
let
me
help
you
he
assisted
her
through
the
marginal
underwood
and
down
to
the
stones
they
walked
on
together
to
a
tiny
cascade
about
a
foot
wide
and
high
and
sat
down
beside
it
on
the
flags
that
for
nine
months
in
the
year
were
submerged
beneath
a
gushing
bourne
from
their
feet
trickled
the
attenuated
thread
of
water
which
alone
remained
to
tell
the
intent
and
reason
of
this
aisle
and
journeyed
on
in
a
zigzag
line
till
lost
in
the
shade
knight
leaning
on
his
elbow
after
contemplating
all
this
looked
critically
at
elfride
does
not
such
a
luxuriant
head
of
hair
exhaust
itself
and
get
thin
as
the
years
go
on
from
eighteen
to
he
asked
at
length
oh
no
she
said
quickly
with
a
visible
disinclination
to
harbour
such
a
thought
which
came
upon
her
with
an
unpleasantness
whose
force
it
would
be
difficult
for
men
to
understand
she
added
afterwards
with
smouldering
uneasiness
do
you
really
think
that
a
great
abundance
of
hair
is
more
likely
to
get
thin
than
a
moderate
quantity
yes
i
really
do
i
believe
am
almost
sure
in
fact
that
if
statistics
could
be
obtained
on
the
subject
you
would
find
the
persons
with
thin
hair
were
those
who
had
a
superabundance
originally
and
that
those
who
start
with
a
moderate
quantity
retain
it
without
much
elfride
s
troubles
sat
upon
her
face
as
well
as
in
her
heart
perhaps
to
a
woman
it
is
almost
as
dreadful
to
think
of
losing
her
beauty
as
of
losing
her
reputation
at
any
rate
she
looked
quite
as
gloomy
as
she
had
looked
at
any
minute
that
day
you
shouldn
t
be
so
troubled
about
a
mere
personal
adornment
said
knight
with
some
of
the
severity
of
tone
that
had
been
customary
before
she
had
beguiled
him
into
softness
i
think
it
is
a
woman
s
duty
to
be
as
beautiful
as
she
can
if
i
were
a
scholar
i
would
give
you
chapter
and
verse
for
it
from
one
of
your
own
latin
authors
i
know
there
is
such
a
passage
for
papa
has
alluded
to
munditiae
et
ornatus
et
cultus
is
that
it
a
passage
in
livy
which
is
no
defence
at
no
it
is
not
never
mind
then
for
i
have
a
reason
for
not
taking
up
my
old
cudgels
against
you
elfie
can
you
guess
what
the
reason
is
no
but
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
she
said
thankfully
for
it
is
dreadful
when
you
talk
so
for
whatever
dreadful
name
the
weakness
may
deserve
i
must
candidly
own
that
i
am
terrified
to
think
my
hair
may
ever
get
of
course
a
sensible
woman
would
rather
lose
her
wits
than
her
i
don
t
care
if
you
do
say
satire
and
judge
me
cruelly
i
know
my
hair
is
beautiful
everybody
says
why
my
dear
miss
swancourt
he
tenderly
replied
i
have
not
said
anything
against
it
but
you
know
what
is
said
about
handsome
being
and
handsome
poor
miss
cuts
but
a
sorry
figure
beside
miss
in
every
man
s
eyes
your
own
not
excepted
knight
though
it
pleases
you
to
throw
off
so
said
elfride
saucily
and
lowering
her
voice
you
ought
not
to
have
taken
so
much
trouble
to
save
me
from
falling
over
the
cliff
for
you
don
t
think
mine
a
life
worth
much
trouble
perhaps
you
think
mine
was
not
worth
it
was
worth
anybody
s
her
hand
was
plashing
in
the
little
waterfall
and
her
eyes
were
bent
the
same
way
you
talk
about
my
severity
with
you
elfride
you
are
unkind
to
me
you
how
she
asked
looking
up
from
her
idle
occupation
after
my
taking
trouble
to
get
jewellery
to
please
you
you
wouldn
t
accept
perhaps
i
would
now
perhaps
i
want
do
said
knight
and
the
packet
was
withdrawn
from
his
pocket
and
presented
the
third
time
elfride
took
it
with
delight
the
obstacle
was
rent
in
twain
and
the
significant
gift
was
hers
i
ll
take
out
these
ugly
ones
at
once
she
exclaimed
and
i
ll
wear
yours
shall
i
i
should
be
now
though
it
may
seem
unlikely
considering
how
far
the
two
had
gone
in
converse
knight
had
never
yet
ventured
to
kiss
elfride
far
slower
was
he
than
stephen
smith
in
matters
like
that
the
utmost
advance
he
had
made
in
such
demonstrations
had
been
to
the
degree
witnessed
by
stephen
in
the
so
elfride
s
cheek
being
still
forbidden
fruit
to
him
he
said
impulsively
elfie
i
should
like
to
touch
that
seductive
ear
of
yours
those
are
my
gifts
so
let
me
dress
you
in
she
hesitated
with
a
stimulating
hesitation
let
me
put
just
one
in
its
place
then
her
face
grew
much
warmer
i
don
t
think
it
would
be
quite
the
usual
or
proper
course
she
said
suddenly
turning
and
resuming
her
operation
of
plashing
in
the
miniature
cataract
the
stillness
of
things
was
disturbed
by
a
bird
coming
to
the
streamlet
to
drink
after
watching
him
dip
his
bill
sprinkle
himself
and
fly
into
a
tree
knight
replied
with
the
courteous
brusqueness
she
so
much
liked
to
hear
elfride
now
you
may
as
well
be
fair
you
would
mind
my
doing
it
but
little
i
think
so
give
me
leave
i
will
be
fair
then
she
said
confidingly
and
looking
him
full
in
the
face
it
was
a
particular
pleasure
to
her
to
be
able
to
do
a
little
honesty
without
fear
i
should
not
mind
your
doing
so
i
should
like
such
an
attention
my
thought
was
would
it
be
right
to
let
you
then
i
will
he
rejoined
with
that
singular
earnestness
about
a
small
matter
in
the
eyes
of
a
ladies
man
but
a
momentary
peg
for
flirtation
or
jest
which
is
only
found
in
deep
natures
who
have
been
wholly
unused
to
toying
with
womankind
and
which
from
its
unwontedness
is
in
itself
a
tribute
the
most
precious
that
can
be
rendered
and
homage
the
most
exquisite
to
be
received
and
you
shall
she
whispered
without
reserve
and
no
longer
mistress
of
the
ceremonies
and
then
elfride
inclined
herself
towards
him
thrust
back
her
hair
and
poised
her
head
sideways
in
doing
this
her
arm
and
shoulder
necessarily
rested
against
his
breast
at
the
touch
the
sensation
of
both
seemed
to
be
concentrated
at
the
point
of
contact
all
the
time
he
was
performing
the
delicate
manoeuvre
knight
trembled
like
a
young
surgeon
in
his
first
operation
now
the
other
said
knight
in
a
whisper
no
why
not
i
don
t
know
you
must
your
touch
agitates
me
so
let
us
go
don
t
say
that
elfride
what
is
it
after
all
a
mere
nothing
now
turn
round
she
was
powerless
to
disobey
and
turned
forthwith
and
then
without
any
defined
intention
in
either
s
mind
his
face
and
hers
drew
closer
together
and
he
supported
her
there
and
kissed
her
knight
was
at
once
the
most
ardent
and
the
coolest
man
alive
when
his
emotions
slumbered
he
appeared
almost
phlegmatic
when
they
were
moved
he
was
no
less
than
passionate
and
now
without
having
quite
intended
an
early
marriage
he
put
the
question
plainly
it
came
with
all
the
ardour
which
was
the
accumulation
of
long
years
behind
a
natural
reserve
elfride
when
shall
we
be
married
the
words
were
sweet
to
her
but
there
was
a
bitter
in
the
sweet
these
acts
of
his
which
had
culminated
in
this
plain
question
coming
on
the
very
day
of
jethway
s
blasting
reproaches
painted
distinctly
her
fickleness
as
an
enormity
loving
him
in
secret
had
not
seemed
such
inconstancy
as
the
same
love
recognized
and
acted
upon
in
the
face
of
threats
her
distraction
was
interpreted
by
him
at
her
side
as
the
outward
signs
of
an
unwonted
experience
i
don
t
press
you
for
an
answer
now
darling
he
said
seeing
she
was
not
likely
to
give
a
lucid
reply
take
your
knight
was
as
honourable
a
man
as
was
ever
loved
and
deluded
by
woman
it
may
be
said
that
his
blindness
in
love
proved
the
point
for
shrewdness
in
love
usually
goes
with
meanness
in
general
once
the
passion
had
mastered
him
the
intellect
had
gone
for
naught
knight
as
a
lover
was
more
and
far
simpler
than
his
friend
stephen
who
in
other
capacities
was
shallow
beside
him
without
saying
more
on
the
subject
of
their
marriage
knight
held
her
at
arm
s
length
as
if
she
had
been
a
large
bouquet
and
looked
at
her
with
critical
affection
does
your
pretty
gift
become
me
she
inquired
with
tears
of
excitement
on
the
fringes
of
her
eyes
undoubtedly
perfectly
said
her
lover
adopting
a
lighter
tone
to
put
her
at
her
ease
ah
you
should
see
them
you
look
shinier
than
ever
fancy
that
i
have
been
able
to
improve
you
am
i
really
so
nice
i
am
glad
for
your
sake
i
wish
i
could
see
you
can
t
you
must
wait
till
we
get
i
shall
never
be
able
she
said
laughing
look
here
s
a
so
there
is
well
done
woman
s
wit
hold
me
steady
oh
and
don
t
let
me
fall
will
you
by
no
below
their
seat
the
thread
of
water
paused
to
spread
out
into
a
smooth
small
pool
knight
supported
her
whilst
she
knelt
down
and
leant
over
it
i
can
see
myself
really
try
as
religiously
as
i
will
i
can
not
help
admiring
my
appearance
in
doubtless
how
can
you
be
so
fond
of
finery
i
believe
you
are
corrupting
me
into
a
taste
for
it
i
used
to
hate
every
such
thing
before
i
knew
i
like
ornaments
because
i
want
people
to
admire
what
you
possess
and
envy
you
and
say
i
wish
i
was
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
object
after
that
and
how
much
longer
are
you
going
to
look
in
there
at
yourself
until
you
are
tired
of
holding
me
oh
i
want
to
ask
you
and
she
turned
round
now
tell
truly
won
t
you
what
colour
of
hair
do
you
like
best
now
knight
did
not
answer
at
the
moment
say
light
do
she
whispered
coaxingly
don
t
say
dark
as
you
did
that
then
exactly
the
colour
of
my
sweetheart
really
said
elfride
enjoying
as
truth
what
she
knew
to
be
flattery
and
blue
eyes
too
not
hazel
say
yes
say
yes
one
recantation
is
enough
for
no
very
well
blue
and
knight
laughed
and
drew
her
close
and
kissed
her
the
second
time
which
operations
he
performed
with
the
carefulness
of
a
fruiterer
touching
a
bunch
of
grapes
so
as
not
to
disturb
their
bloom
elfride
objected
to
a
second
and
flung
away
her
face
the
movement
causing
a
slight
disarrangement
of
hat
and
hair
hardly
thinking
what
she
said
in
the
trepidation
of
the
moment
she
exclaimed
clapping
her
hand
to
her
ear
ah
we
must
be
careful
i
lost
the
other
earring
doing
like
no
sooner
did
she
realise
the
significant
words
than
a
troubled
look
passed
across
her
face
and
she
shut
her
lips
as
if
to
keep
them
back
doing
like
what
said
knight
perplexed
oh
sitting
down
out
of
doors
she
replied
hastily
chapter
xxix
care
thou
it
is
an
evening
at
the
beginning
of
october
and
the
mellowest
of
autumn
sunsets
irradiates
london
even
to
its
uttermost
eastern
end
between
the
eye
and
the
flaming
west
columns
of
smoke
stand
up
in
the
still
air
like
tall
trees
everything
in
the
shade
is
rich
and
misty
blue
and
swancourt
and
elfride
are
looking
at
these
lustrous
and
lurid
contrasts
from
the
window
of
a
large
hotel
near
london
bridge
the
visit
to
their
friends
at
leonards
is
over
and
they
are
staying
a
day
or
two
in
the
metropolis
on
their
way
home
knight
spent
the
same
interval
of
time
in
crossing
over
to
brittany
by
way
of
jersey
and
malo
he
then
passed
through
normandy
and
returned
to
london
also
his
arrival
there
having
been
two
days
later
than
that
of
elfride
and
her
parents
so
the
evening
of
this
october
day
saw
them
all
meeting
at
the
hotel
where
they
had
previously
engaged
apartments
during
the
afternoon
knight
had
been
to
his
lodgings
at
richmond
to
make
a
little
change
in
the
nature
of
his
baggage
and
on
coming
up
again
there
was
never
ushered
by
a
bland
waiter
into
a
comfortable
room
a
happier
man
than
knight
when
shown
to
where
elfride
and
her
were
sitting
after
a
fatiguing
day
of
shopping
elfride
looked
none
the
better
for
her
change
knight
was
as
brown
as
a
nut
they
were
soon
engaged
by
themselves
in
a
corner
of
the
room
now
that
the
precious
words
of
promise
had
been
spoken
the
young
girl
had
no
idea
of
keeping
up
her
price
by
the
system
of
reserve
which
other
more
accomplished
maidens
use
her
lover
was
with
her
again
and
it
was
enough
she
made
her
heart
over
to
him
entirely
dinner
was
soon
despatched
and
when
a
preliminary
round
of
conversation
concerning
their
doings
since
the
last
parting
had
been
concluded
they
reverted
to
the
subject
of
s
journey
home
that
enervating
ride
through
the
myrtle
climate
of
south
devon
how
i
dread
it
swancourt
was
saying
i
had
hoped
the
weather
would
have
been
cooler
by
this
did
you
ever
go
by
water
said
knight
never
by
never
i
mean
not
since
the
time
of
then
if
you
can
afford
an
additional
day
i
propose
that
we
do
it
said
knight
the
channel
is
like
a
lake
just
now
we
should
reach
plymouth
in
about
forty
hours
i
think
and
the
boats
start
from
just
below
the
bridge
here
pointing
over
his
shoulder
eastward
hear
hear
said
the
vicar
it
s
an
idea
certainly
said
his
wife
of
course
these
coasters
are
rather
tubby
said
knight
but
you
wouldn
t
mind
that
no
we
wouldn
t
and
the
saloon
is
a
place
like
the
fishmarket
of
a
country
town
but
that
wouldn
t
matter
oh
dear
no
if
we
had
only
thought
of
it
soon
enough
we
might
have
had
the
use
of
lord
luxellian
s
yacht
but
never
mind
we
ll
go
we
shall
escape
the
worrying
rattle
through
the
whole
length
of
london
morning
not
to
mention
the
risk
of
being
killed
by
excursion
trains
which
is
not
a
little
one
at
this
time
of
the
year
if
the
papers
are
elfride
too
thought
the
arrangement
delightful
and
accordingly
ten
o
clock
the
following
morning
saw
two
cabs
crawling
round
by
the
mint
and
between
the
preternaturally
high
walls
of
nightingale
lane
towards
the
river
side
the
first
vehicle
was
occupied
by
the
travellers
in
person
and
the
second
brought
up
the
luggage
under
the
supervision
of
snewson
swancourt
s
maid
and
for
the
last
fortnight
elfride
s
also
for
although
the
younger
lady
had
never
been
accustomed
to
any
such
attendant
at
robing
times
her
stepmother
forced
her
into
a
semblance
of
familiarity
with
one
when
they
were
away
from
home
presently
waggons
bales
and
smells
of
all
descriptions
increased
to
such
an
extent
that
the
advance
of
the
cabs
was
at
the
slowest
possible
rate
at
intervals
it
was
necessary
to
halt
entirely
that
the
heavy
vehicles
unloading
in
front
might
be
moved
aside
a
feat
which
was
not
accomplished
without
a
deal
of
swearing
and
noise
the
vicar
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
surely
there
must
be
some
mistake
in
the
way
he
said
with
great
concern
drawing
in
his
head
again
there
s
not
a
respectable
conveyance
to
be
seen
here
except
ours
i
ve
heard
that
there
are
strange
dens
in
this
part
of
london
into
which
people
have
been
entrapped
and
murdered
surely
there
is
no
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
the
cabman
oh
no
no
it
is
all
right
said
knight
who
was
as
placid
as
dewy
eve
by
the
side
of
elfride
but
what
i
argue
from
said
the
vicar
with
a
greater
emphasis
of
uneasiness
are
plain
appearances
this
can
t
be
the
highway
from
london
to
plymouth
by
water
because
it
is
no
way
at
all
to
any
place
we
shall
miss
our
steamer
and
our
train
too
that
s
what
i
depend
upon
it
we
are
right
in
fact
here
we
trimmer
s
wharf
said
the
cabman
opening
the
door
no
sooner
had
they
alighted
than
they
perceived
a
tussle
going
on
between
the
hindmost
cabman
and
a
crowd
of
light
porters
who
had
charged
him
in
column
to
obtain
possession
of
the
bags
and
boxes
snewson
s
hands
being
seen
stretched
towards
heaven
in
the
midst
of
the
melee
knight
advanced
gallantly
and
after
a
hard
struggle
reduced
the
crowd
to
two
upon
whose
shoulders
and
trucks
the
goods
vanished
away
in
the
direction
of
the
water
s
edge
with
startling
rapidity
then
more
of
the
same
tribe
who
had
run
on
ahead
were
heard
shouting
to
boatmen
three
of
whom
pulled
alongside
and
two
being
vanquished
the
luggage
went
tumbling
into
the
remaining
one
never
saw
such
a
dreadful
scene
in
my
life
never
said
swancourt
floundering
into
the
boat
worse
than
famine
and
sword
upon
one
i
thought
such
customs
were
confined
to
continental
ports
aren
t
you
astonished
elfride
oh
no
said
elfride
appearing
amid
the
dingy
scene
like
a
rainbow
in
a
murky
sky
it
is
a
pleasant
novelty
i
where
in
the
wide
ocean
is
our
steamer
the
vicar
inquired
i
can
see
nothing
but
old
hulks
for
the
life
of
just
behind
that
one
said
knight
we
shall
soon
be
round
under
the
object
of
their
search
was
soon
after
disclosed
to
view
a
great
lumbering
form
of
inky
blackness
which
looked
as
if
it
had
never
known
the
touch
of
a
for
fifty
years
it
was
lying
beside
just
such
another
and
the
way
on
board
was
down
a
narrow
lane
of
water
between
the
two
about
a
yard
and
a
half
wide
at
one
end
and
gradually
converging
to
a
point
at
the
moment
of
their
entry
into
this
narrow
passage
a
brilliantly
painted
rival
paddled
down
the
river
like
a
trotting
steed
creating
such
a
series
of
waves
and
splashes
that
their
frail
wherry
was
tossed
like
a
teacup
and
the
vicar
and
his
wife
slanted
this
way
and
that
inclining
their
heads
into
contact
with
a
air
and
countenance
the
wavelets
striking
the
sides
of
the
two
hulls
and
flapping
back
into
their
laps
dreadful
horrible
swancourt
murmured
privately
and
said
aloud
i
thought
we
walked
on
board
i
don
t
think
really
i
should
have
come
if
i
had
known
this
trouble
was
attached
to
if
they
must
splash
i
wish
they
would
splash
us
with
clean
water
said
the
old
lady
wiping
her
dress
with
her
handkerchief
i
hope
it
is
perfectly
safe
continued
the
vicar
o
papa
you
are
not
very
brave
cried
elfride
merrily
bravery
is
only
obtuseness
to
the
perception
of
contingencies
swancourt
severely
answered
swancourt
laughed
and
elfride
laughed
and
knight
laughed
in
the
midst
of
which
pleasantness
a
man
shouted
to
them
from
some
position
between
their
heads
and
the
sky
and
they
found
they
were
close
to
the
juliet
into
which
they
quiveringly
ascended
it
having
been
found
that
the
lowness
of
the
tide
would
prevent
their
getting
off
for
an
hour
the
swancourts
having
nothing
else
to
do
allowed
their
eyes
to
idle
upon
men
in
blue
jerseys
performing
mysterious
mending
operations
with
they
turned
to
look
at
the
dashes
of
lurid
sunlight
like
burnished
copper
stars
afloat
on
the
ripples
which
danced
into
and
tantalized
their
vision
or
listened
to
the
loud
music
of
a
at
work
close
by
or
to
sighing
sounds
from
the
funnels
of
passing
steamers
getting
dead
as
they
grew
more
distant
or
to
shouts
from
the
decks
of
different
craft
in
their
vicinity
all
of
them
assuming
the
form
of
ten
not
yet
off
swancourt
breathed
a
breath
of
weariness
and
looked
at
his
in
general
their
faces
were
certainly
not
worth
looking
at
the
expression
waiting
was
written
upon
them
so
absolutely
that
nothing
more
could
be
discerned
there
all
animation
was
suspended
till
providence
should
raise
the
water
and
let
them
go
i
have
been
thinking
said
knight
that
we
have
come
amongst
the
rarest
class
of
people
in
the
kingdom
of
all
human
characteristics
a
low
opinion
of
the
value
of
his
own
time
by
an
individual
must
be
among
the
strangest
to
find
here
we
see
numbers
of
that
patient
and
happy
species
rovers
as
distinct
from
but
they
are
to
whom
time
is
of
no
oh
no
the
we
meet
on
the
grand
routes
are
more
anxious
than
commercial
travellers
to
rush
on
and
added
to
the
loss
of
time
in
getting
to
their
journey
s
end
these
exceptional
people
take
their
chance
of
by
coming
this
can
it
be
inquired
the
vicar
with
apprehension
surely
not
knight
just
here
in
our
english
channel
close
at
our
doors
as
i
may
entrance
passages
are
very
draughty
places
and
the
channel
is
like
the
rest
it
ruins
the
temper
of
sailors
it
has
been
calculated
by
philosophers
that
more
damns
go
up
to
heaven
from
the
channel
in
the
course
of
a
year
than
from
all
the
five
oceans
put
they
really
start
now
and
the
dead
looks
of
all
the
throng
come
to
life
immediately
the
man
who
has
been
frantically
hauling
in
a
rope
that
bade
fair
to
have
no
end
ceases
his
labours
and
they
glide
down
the
serpentine
bends
of
the
thames
anything
anywhere
was
a
mine
of
interest
to
elfride
and
so
was
this
it
is
well
enough
now
said
swancourt
after
they
had
passed
the
nore
but
i
can
t
say
i
have
cared
for
my
voyage
for
being
now
in
the
open
sea
a
slight
breeze
had
sprung
up
which
cheered
her
as
well
as
her
two
younger
companions
but
unfortunately
it
had
a
reverse
effect
upon
the
vicar
who
after
turning
a
sort
of
apricot
jam
colour
interspersed
with
dashes
of
raspberry
pleaded
indisposition
and
vanished
from
their
sight
the
afternoon
wore
on
swancourt
kindly
sat
apart
by
herself
reading
and
the
betrothed
pair
were
left
to
themselves
elfride
clung
trustingly
to
knight
s
arm
and
proud
was
she
to
walk
with
him
up
and
down
the
deck
or
to
go
forward
and
leaning
with
him
against
the
forecastle
rails
watch
the
setting
sun
gradually
withdrawing
itself
over
their
stern
into
a
huge
bank
of
livid
cloud
with
golden
edges
that
rose
to
meet
it
she
was
childishly
full
of
life
and
spirits
though
in
walking
up
and
down
with
him
before
the
other
passengers
and
getting
noticed
by
them
she
was
at
starting
rather
confused
it
being
the
first
time
she
had
shown
herself
so
openly
under
that
kind
of
protection
i
expect
they
are
envious
and
saying
things
about
us
don
t
you
she
would
whisper
to
knight
with
a
stealthy
smile
oh
no
he
would
answer
unconcernedly
why
should
they
envy
us
and
what
can
they
say
not
any
harm
of
course
elfride
replied
except
such
as
this
how
happy
those
two
are
she
is
proud
enough
what
makes
it
worse
she
continued
in
the
extremity
of
confidence
i
heard
those
two
cricketing
men
say
just
now
she
s
the
nobbiest
girl
on
the
but
i
don
t
mind
it
you
know
i
should
hardly
have
supposed
you
did
even
if
you
had
not
told
me
said
knight
with
great
blandness
she
was
never
tired
of
asking
her
lover
questions
and
admiring
his
answers
good
bad
or
indifferent
as
they
might
be
the
evening
grew
dark
and
night
came
on
and
lights
shone
upon
them
from
the
horizon
and
from
the
sky
now
look
there
ahead
of
us
at
that
halo
in
the
air
of
silvery
brightness
watch
it
and
you
will
see
what
it
comes
she
watched
for
a
few
minutes
when
two
white
lights
emerged
from
the
side
of
a
hill
and
showed
themselves
to
be
the
origin
of
the
halo
what
a
dazzling
brilliance
what
do
they
mark
the
south
foreland
they
were
previously
covered
by
the
what
is
that
level
line
of
little
sparkles
a
town
i
suppose
that
s
all
this
time
and
later
soft
sheet
lightning
expanded
from
a
cloud
in
their
path
enkindling
their
faces
as
they
paced
up
and
down
shining
over
the
water
and
for
a
moment
showing
the
horizon
as
a
keen
line
elfride
slept
soundly
that
night
her
first
thought
the
next
morning
was
the
thrilling
one
that
knight
was
as
close
at
hand
as
when
they
were
at
home
at
endelstow
and
her
first
sight
on
looking
out
of
the
cabin
window
was
the
perpendicular
face
of
beachy
head
gleaming
white
in
a
brilliant
sun
this
fair
daybreak
however
soon
changed
its
aspect
a
cold
wind
and
a
pale
mist
descended
upon
the
sea
and
seemed
to
threaten
a
dreary
day
when
they
were
nearing
southampton
swancourt
came
to
say
that
her
husband
was
so
ill
that
he
wished
to
be
put
on
shore
here
and
left
to
do
the
remainder
of
the
journey
by
land
he
will
be
perfectly
well
directly
he
treads
firm
ground
again
which
shall
we
do
go
with
him
or
finish
our
voyage
as
we
intended
elfride
was
comfortably
housed
under
an
umbrella
which
knight
was
holding
over
her
to
keep
off
the
wind
oh
don
t
let
us
go
on
shore
she
said
with
dismay
it
would
be
such
a
pity
that
s
very
fine
said
swancourt
archly
as
to
a
child
see
the
wind
has
increased
her
colour
the
sea
her
appetite
and
spirits
and
somebody
her
happiness
yes
it
would
be
a
pity
tis
my
misfortune
to
be
always
spoken
to
from
a
pedestal
sighed
elfride
well
we
will
do
as
you
like
swancourt
said
knight
but
i
myself
would
rather
remain
on
board
interrupted
the
elder
lady
and
swancourt
particularly
wishes
to
go
by
himself
so
that
shall
settle
the
the
vicar
now
a
drab
colour
was
put
ashore
and
became
as
well
as
ever
forthwith
elfride
sitting
alone
in
a
retired
part
of
the
vessel
saw
a
veiled
woman
walk
aboard
among
the
very
latest
arrivals
at
this
port
she
was
clothed
in
black
silk
and
carried
a
dark
shawl
upon
her
arm
the
woman
without
looking
around
her
turned
to
the
quarter
allotted
to
the
passengers
all
the
carnation
swancourt
had
complimented
her
upon
possessing
left
elfride
s
cheeks
and
she
trembled
visibly
she
ran
to
the
other
side
of
the
boat
where
swancourt
was
standing
let
us
go
home
by
railway
with
papa
after
all
she
pleaded
earnestly
i
would
rather
go
with
him
shall
we
swancourt
looked
around
for
a
moment
as
if
unable
to
decide
ah
she
exclaimed
it
is
too
late
now
why
did
not
you
say
so
before
when
we
had
plenty
of
time
the
juliet
had
at
that
minute
let
go
the
engines
had
started
and
they
were
gliding
slowly
away
from
the
quay
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
to
remain
unless
the
juliet
could
be
made
to
put
back
and
that
would
create
a
great
disturbance
elfride
gave
up
the
idea
and
submitted
quietly
her
happiness
was
sadly
mutilated
now
the
woman
whose
presence
had
so
disturbed
her
was
exactly
like
jethway
she
seemed
to
haunt
elfride
like
a
shadow
after
several
minutes
vain
endeavour
to
account
for
any
design
jethway
could
have
in
watching
her
elfride
decided
to
think
that
if
it
were
the
widow
the
encounter
was
accidental
she
remembered
that
the
widow
in
her
restlessness
was
often
visiting
the
village
near
southampton
which
was
her
original
home
and
it
was
possible
that
she
chose
with
the
idea
of
saving
expense
what
is
the
matter
elfride
knight
inquired
standing
before
her
nothing
more
than
that
i
am
rather
i
don
t
much
wonder
at
it
that
wharf
was
depressing
we
seemed
underneath
and
inferior
to
everything
around
us
but
we
shall
be
in
the
sea
breeze
again
soon
and
that
will
freshen
you
the
evening
closed
in
and
dusk
increased
as
they
made
way
down
southampton
water
and
through
the
solent
elfride
s
disturbance
of
mind
was
such
that
her
light
spirits
of
the
foregoing
four
and
twenty
hours
had
entirely
deserted
her
the
weather
too
had
grown
more
gloomy
for
though
the
showers
of
the
morning
had
ceased
the
sky
was
covered
more
closely
than
ever
with
dense
leaden
clouds
how
beautiful
was
the
sunset
when
they
rounded
the
north
foreland
the
previous
evening
now
it
was
impossible
to
tell
within
half
an
hour
the
time
of
the
luminary
s
going
down
knight
led
her
about
and
being
by
this
time
accustomed
to
her
sudden
changes
of
mood
overlooked
the
necessity
of
a
cause
in
regarding
the
conditions
impressionableness
and
elasticity
elfride
looked
stealthily
to
the
other
end
of
the
vessel
jethway
or
her
double
was
sitting
at
the
stern
her
eye
steadily
regarding
elfride
let
us
go
to
the
forepart
she
said
quickly
to
knight
see
there
the
man
is
fixing
the
lights
for
the
knight
assented
and
after
watching
the
operation
of
fixing
the
red
and
the
green
lights
on
the
port
and
starboard
bows
and
the
hoisting
of
the
white
light
to
the
masthead
he
walked
up
and
down
with
her
till
the
increase
of
wind
rendered
promenading
difficult
elfride
s
eyes
were
occasionally
to
be
found
furtively
gazing
abaft
to
learn
if
her
enemy
were
really
there
nobody
was
visible
now
shall
we
go
below
said
knight
seeing
that
the
deck
was
nearly
deserted
no
she
said
if
you
will
kindly
get
me
a
rug
from
swancourt
i
should
like
if
you
don
t
mind
to
stay
she
had
recently
fancied
the
assumed
jethway
might
be
a
passenger
and
dreaded
meeting
her
by
accident
knight
appeared
with
the
rug
and
they
sat
down
behind
a
on
the
windward
side
just
as
the
two
red
eyes
of
the
needles
glared
upon
them
from
the
gloom
their
pointed
summits
rising
like
shadowy
phantom
figures
against
the
sky
it
became
necessary
to
go
below
to
an
clock
meal
of
nondescript
kind
and
elfride
was
immensely
relieved
at
finding
no
sign
of
jethway
there
they
again
ascended
and
remained
above
till
snewson
staggered
up
to
them
with
the
message
that
swancourt
thought
it
was
time
for
elfride
to
come
below
knight
accompanied
her
down
and
returned
again
to
pass
a
little
more
time
on
deck
elfride
partly
undressed
herself
and
lay
down
and
soon
became
unconscious
though
her
sleep
was
light
how
long
she
had
lain
she
knew
not
when
by
slow
degrees
she
became
cognizant
of
a
whispering
in
her
ear
you
are
well
on
with
him
i
can
see
well
provoke
me
now
but
my
day
will
come
you
will
that
seemed
to
be
the
utterance
or
words
to
that
effect
elfride
became
broad
awake
and
terrified
she
knew
the
words
if
real
could
be
only
those
of
one
person
and
that
person
the
widow
jethway
the
lamp
had
gone
out
and
the
place
was
in
darkness
in
the
next
berth
she
could
hear
her
stepmother
breathing
heavily
further
on
snewson
breathing
more
heavily
still
these
were
the
only
other
legitimate
occupants
of
the
cabin
and
jethway
must
have
stealthily
come
in
by
some
means
and
retreated
again
or
else
she
had
entered
an
empty
berth
next
snewson
s
the
fear
that
this
was
the
case
increased
elfride
s
perturbation
till
it
assumed
the
dimensions
of
a
certainty
for
how
could
a
stranger
from
the
other
end
of
the
ship
possibly
contrive
to
get
in
could
it
have
been
a
dream
elfride
raised
herself
higher
and
looked
out
of
the
window
there
was
the
sea
floundering
and
rushing
against
the
ship
s
side
just
by
her
head
and
thence
stretching
away
dim
and
moaning
into
an
expanse
of
indistinctness
and
far
beyond
all
this
two
placid
lights
like
rayless
stars
now
almost
fearing
to
turn
her
face
inwards
again
lest
jethway
should
appear
at
her
elbow
elfride
meditated
upon
whether
to
call
snewson
to
keep
her
company
four
bells
sounded
and
she
heard
voices
which
gave
her
a
little
courage
it
was
not
worth
while
to
call
snewson
at
any
rate
elfride
could
not
stay
there
panting
longer
at
the
risk
of
being
again
disturbed
by
that
dreadful
whispering
so
wrapping
herself
up
hurriedly
she
emerged
into
the
passage
and
by
the
aid
of
a
faint
light
burning
at
the
entrance
to
the
saloon
found
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
ascended
to
the
deck
dreary
the
place
was
in
the
extreme
it
seemed
a
new
spot
altogether
in
contrast
with
its
daytime
self
she
could
see
the
glowworm
light
from
the
binnacle
and
the
dim
outline
of
the
man
at
the
wheel
also
a
form
at
the
bows
not
another
soul
was
apparent
from
stem
to
stern
yes
there
were
two
more
by
the
bulwarks
one
proved
to
be
her
harry
the
other
the
mate
she
was
glad
indeed
and
on
drawing
closer
found
they
were
holding
a
low
slow
chat
about
nautical
affairs
she
ran
up
and
slipped
her
hand
through
knight
s
arm
partly
for
love
partly
for
stability
elfie
not
asleep
said
knight
after
moving
a
few
steps
aside
with
her
no
i
can
not
sleep
may
i
stay
here
it
is
so
dismal
down
there
and
and
i
was
afraid
where
are
we
now
due
south
of
portland
bill
those
are
the
lights
abeam
of
us
look
a
terrible
spot
that
on
a
stormy
night
and
do
you
see
a
very
small
light
that
dips
and
rises
to
the
right
that
s
a
on
the
dangerous
shoal
called
the
shambles
where
many
a
good
vessel
has
gone
to
pieces
between
it
and
ourselves
is
the
race
a
place
where
antagonistic
currents
meet
and
form
whirlpools
a
spot
which
is
rough
in
the
smoothest
weather
and
terrific
in
a
wind
that
dark
dreary
horizon
we
just
discern
to
the
left
is
the
west
bay
terminated
landwards
by
the
chesil
what
time
is
it
harry
just
past
are
you
going
below
oh
no
not
i
prefer
pure
she
fancied
he
might
be
displeased
with
her
for
coming
to
him
at
this
unearthly
hour
i
should
like
to
stay
here
too
if
you
will
allow
me
she
said
timidly
i
want
to
ask
you
allow
you
elfie
said
knight
putting
his
arm
round
her
and
drawing
her
closer
i
am
twice
as
happy
with
you
by
my
side
yes
we
will
stay
and
watch
the
approach
of
so
they
again
sought
out
the
sheltered
nook
and
sitting
down
wrapped
themselves
in
the
rug
as
before
what
were
you
going
to
ask
me
he
inquired
as
they
undulated
up
and
down
oh
it
was
not
much
perhaps
a
thing
i
ought
not
to
ask
she
said
hesitatingly
her
sudden
wish
had
really
been
to
discover
at
once
whether
he
had
ever
before
been
engaged
to
be
married
if
he
had
she
would
make
that
a
ground
for
telling
him
a
little
of
her
conduct
with
stephen
jethway
s
seeming
words
had
so
depressed
the
girl
that
she
herself
now
painted
her
flight
in
the
darkest
colours
and
longed
to
ease
her
burdened
mind
by
an
instant
confession
if
knight
had
ever
been
imprudent
himself
he
might
she
hoped
forgive
all
i
wanted
to
ask
you
she
went
on
if
you
had
ever
been
engaged
she
added
tremulously
i
hope
you
have
i
mean
i
don
t
mind
at
all
if
you
no
i
never
was
knight
instantly
and
heartily
replied
elfride
and
there
was
a
certain
happy
pride
in
his
tone
i
am
twelve
years
older
than
you
and
i
have
been
about
the
world
and
in
a
way
into
society
and
you
have
not
and
yet
i
am
not
so
unfit
for
you
as
people
might
imagine
who
would
assume
the
difference
in
age
to
signify
most
surely
an
equal
addition
to
my
practice
in
elfride
shivered
you
are
cold
is
the
wind
too
much
for
you
no
she
said
gloomily
the
belief
which
had
been
her
in
hoping
for
forgiveness
had
proved
false
this
account
of
the
exceptional
nature
of
his
experience
a
matter
which
would
have
set
her
rejoicing
two
years
ago
chilled
her
now
like
a
frost
you
don
t
mind
my
asking
you
she
continued
oh
no
not
at
and
have
you
never
kissed
many
ladies
she
whispered
hoping
he
would
say
a
hundred
at
the
least
the
time
the
circumstances
and
the
scene
were
such
as
to
draw
confidences
from
the
most
reserved
elfride
whispered
knight
in
reply
it
is
strange
you
should
have
asked
that
question
but
i
ll
answer
it
though
i
have
never
told
such
a
thing
before
i
have
been
rather
absurd
in
my
avoidance
of
women
i
have
never
given
a
woman
a
kiss
in
my
life
except
yourself
and
my
the
man
of
two
and
thirty
with
the
experienced
mind
warmed
all
over
with
a
boy
s
ingenuous
shame
as
he
made
the
confession
what
not
one
she
faltered
no
not
how
very
strange
yes
the
reverse
experience
may
be
commoner
and
yet
to
those
who
have
observed
their
own
sex
as
i
have
my
case
is
not
remarkable
men
about
town
are
women
s
favourites
that
s
the
postulate
and
superficial
people
don
t
think
far
enough
to
see
that
there
may
be
reserved
lonely
are
you
proud
of
it
harry
no
indeed
of
late
years
i
have
wished
i
had
gone
my
ways
and
trod
out
my
measure
like
men
i
have
thought
of
how
many
happy
experiences
i
may
have
lost
through
never
going
to
then
why
did
you
hold
aloof
i
can
not
say
i
don
t
think
it
was
my
nature
to
circumstance
hindered
me
perhaps
i
have
regretted
it
for
another
reason
this
great
remissness
of
mine
has
had
its
effect
upon
me
the
older
i
have
grown
the
more
distinctly
have
i
perceived
that
it
was
absolutely
preventing
me
from
liking
any
woman
who
was
not
as
unpractised
as
i
and
i
gave
up
the
expectation
of
finding
a
young
lady
in
my
own
raw
state
then
i
found
you
elfride
and
i
felt
for
the
first
time
that
my
fastidiousness
was
a
blessing
and
it
helped
to
make
me
worthy
of
you
i
felt
at
once
that
differing
as
we
did
in
other
experiences
in
this
matter
i
resembled
you
well
aren
t
you
glad
to
hear
it
elfride
yes
i
am
she
answered
in
a
forced
voice
but
i
always
had
thought
that
men
made
lots
of
engagements
before
they
married
especially
if
they
don
t
marry
very
so
all
women
think
i
suppose
and
rightly
indeed
of
the
majority
of
bachelors
as
i
said
before
but
an
appreciable
minority
of
men
do
not
and
it
makes
them
very
awkward
when
they
do
come
to
the
point
however
it
didn
t
matter
in
my
why
she
asked
uneasily
because
you
know
even
less
of
and
matrimonial
prearrangement
than
i
and
so
you
can
t
draw
invidious
comparisons
if
i
do
my
engaging
i
think
you
do
it
beautifully
thank
you
dear
but
continued
knight
laughingly
your
opinion
is
not
that
of
an
expert
which
alone
is
of
had
she
answered
yes
it
is
half
as
strongly
as
she
felt
it
knight
might
have
been
a
little
astonished
if
you
had
ever
been
engaged
to
be
married
before
he
went
on
i
expect
your
opinion
of
my
addresses
would
be
different
but
then
i
should
not
should
not
what
harry
oh
i
was
merely
going
to
say
that
in
that
case
i
should
never
have
given
myself
the
pleasure
of
proposing
to
you
since
your
freedom
from
that
experience
was
your
attraction
you
are
severe
on
women
are
you
not
no
i
think
not
i
had
a
right
to
please
my
taste
and
that
was
for
untried
lips
other
men
than
those
of
my
sort
acquire
the
taste
as
they
get
older
but
don
t
find
an
elfride
what
horrid
sound
is
that
we
hear
when
we
pitch
forward
only
the
screw
don
t
find
an
elfride
as
i
did
to
think
that
i
should
have
discovered
such
an
unseen
flower
down
there
in
the
west
to
whom
a
man
is
as
much
as
a
multitude
to
some
women
and
a
trip
down
the
english
channel
like
a
voyage
round
the
world
and
would
you
she
said
and
her
voice
was
tremulous
have
given
up
a
lady
if
you
had
become
engaged
to
her
and
then
found
she
had
had
one
kiss
before
yours
and
would
you
have
gone
away
and
left
her
one
kiss
no
hardly
for
two
well
i
could
hardly
say
inventorially
like
that
too
much
of
that
sort
of
thing
certainly
would
make
me
dislike
a
woman
but
let
us
confine
our
attention
to
ourselves
not
go
thinking
of
might
have
so
elfride
had
allowed
her
thoughts
to
dally
with
false
surmise
and
every
one
of
knight
s
words
fell
upon
her
like
a
weight
after
this
they
were
silent
for
a
long
time
gazing
upon
the
black
mysterious
sea
and
hearing
the
strange
voice
of
the
restless
wind
a
rocking
to
and
fro
on
the
waves
when
the
breeze
is
not
too
violent
and
cold
produces
a
soothing
effect
even
upon
the
most
mind
elfride
slowly
sank
against
knight
and
looking
down
he
found
by
her
soft
regular
breathing
that
she
had
fallen
asleep
not
wishing
to
disturb
her
he
continued
still
and
took
an
intense
pleasure
in
supporting
her
warm
young
form
as
it
rose
and
fell
with
her
every
breath
knight
fell
to
dreaming
too
though
he
continued
wide
awake
it
was
pleasant
to
realize
the
implicit
trust
she
placed
in
him
and
to
think
of
the
charming
innocence
of
one
who
could
sink
to
sleep
in
so
simple
and
unceremonious
a
manner
more
than
all
the
musing
unpractical
student
felt
the
immense
responsibility
he
was
taking
upon
himself
by
becoming
the
protector
and
guide
of
such
a
trusting
creature
the
quiet
slumber
of
her
soul
lent
a
quietness
to
his
own
then
she
moaned
and
turned
herself
restlessly
presently
her
mutterings
became
distinct
don
t
tell
him
he
will
not
love
me
did
not
mean
any
disgrace
indeed
i
did
not
so
don
t
tell
harry
we
were
going
to
be
married
that
was
why
i
ran
away
he
says
he
will
not
have
a
kissed
woman
if
you
tell
him
he
will
go
away
and
i
shall
die
i
pray
have
mercy
oh
elfride
started
up
wildly
the
previous
moment
a
musical
had
spread
into
the
air
from
their
right
hand
and
awakened
her
what
is
it
she
exclaimed
in
terror
only
eight
bells
said
knight
soothingly
don
t
be
frightened
little
bird
you
are
safe
what
have
you
been
dreaming
about
i
can
t
tell
i
can
t
tell
she
said
with
a
shudder
oh
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
stay
quietly
with
me
we
shall
soon
see
the
dawn
now
look
the
morning
star
is
lovely
over
there
the
clouds
have
completely
cleared
off
whilst
you
have
been
sleeping
what
have
you
been
dreaming
of
a
woman
in
our
don
t
you
like
her
i
don
t
she
doesn
t
like
me
where
are
we
about
south
of
the
knight
said
no
more
on
the
words
of
her
dream
they
watched
the
sky
till
elfride
grew
calm
and
the
dawn
appeared
it
was
mere
wan
lightness
first
then
the
wind
blew
in
a
changed
spirit
and
died
away
to
a
zephyr
the
star
dissolved
into
the
day
that
s
how
i
should
like
to
die
said
elfride
rising
from
her
seat
and
leaning
over
the
bulwark
to
watch
the
star
s
last
expiring
gleam
as
the
lines
say
knight
replied
to
set
as
sets
the
morning
star
which
goes
not
down
behind
the
darken
d
west
nor
hides
obscured
among
the
tempests
of
the
sky
but
melts
away
into
the
light
of
oh
other
people
have
thought
the
same
thing
have
they
that
s
always
the
case
with
my
originalities
they
are
original
to
nobody
but
not
only
the
case
with
yours
when
i
was
a
young
hand
at
reviewing
i
used
to
find
that
a
frightful
pitfall
dilating
upon
subjects
i
met
with
which
were
novelties
to
me
and
finding
afterwards
they
had
been
exhausted
by
the
thinking
world
when
i
was
in
that
is
delightful
whenever
i
find
you
have
done
a
foolish
thing
i
am
glad
because
it
seems
to
bring
you
a
little
nearer
to
me
who
have
done
and
elfride
thought
again
of
her
enemy
asleep
under
the
deck
they
trod
all
up
the
coast
prominences
singled
themselves
out
from
recesses
then
a
rosy
sky
spread
over
the
eastern
sea
and
behind
the
low
line
of
land
flinging
its
livery
in
dashes
upon
the
thin
airy
clouds
in
that
direction
every
projection
on
the
land
seemed
now
so
many
fingers
anxious
to
catch
a
little
of
the
liquid
light
thrown
so
prodigally
over
the
sky
and
after
a
fantastic
time
of
lustrous
yellows
in
the
east
the
higher
elevations
along
the
shore
were
flooded
with
the
same
hues
the
bluff
and
bare
contours
of
start
point
caught
the
brightest
earliest
glow
of
all
and
so
also
did
the
sides
of
its
white
lighthouse
perched
upon
a
shelf
in
its
precipitous
front
like
a
mediaeval
saint
in
a
niche
their
lofty
neighbour
bolt
head
on
the
left
remained
as
yet
ungilded
and
retained
its
gray
then
up
came
the
sun
as
it
were
in
jerks
just
to
seaward
of
the
easternmost
point
of
land
flinging
out
a
jacob
path
of
light
from
itself
to
elfride
and
knight
and
coating
them
with
rays
in
a
few
minutes
the
inferior
dignitaries
of
the
shore
froward
point
berry
head
and
prawle
all
had
acquired
their
share
of
the
illumination
ere
this
and
at
length
the
very
smallest
protuberance
of
wave
cliff
or
inlet
even
to
the
innermost
recesses
of
the
lovely
valley
of
the
dart
had
its
portion
and
sunlight
now
the
common
possession
of
all
ceased
to
be
the
wonderful
and
coveted
thing
it
had
been
a
short
half
hour
before
after
breakfast
plymouth
arose
into
view
and
grew
distincter
to
their
nearing
vision
the
breakwater
appearing
like
a
streak
of
phosphoric
light
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
elfride
looked
furtively
around
for
jethway
but
could
discern
no
shape
like
hers
afterwards
in
the
bustle
of
landing
she
looked
again
with
the
same
result
by
which
time
the
woman
had
probably
glided
upon
the
quay
unobserved
expanding
with
a
sense
of
relief
elfride
waited
whilst
knight
looked
to
their
luggage
and
then
saw
her
father
approaching
through
the
crowd
twirling
his
to
catch
their
attention
elbowing
their
way
to
him
they
all
entered
the
town
which
smiled
as
sunny
a
smile
upon
elfride
as
it
had
done
between
one
and
two
years
earlier
when
she
had
entered
it
at
precisely
the
same
hour
as
the
of
stephen
smith
chapter
xxx
vassal
unto
elfride
clung
closer
to
knight
as
day
succeeded
day
whatever
else
might
admit
of
question
there
could
be
no
dispute
that
the
allegiance
she
bore
him
absorbed
her
whole
soul
and
existence
a
greater
than
stephen
had
arisen
and
she
had
left
all
to
follow
him
the
unreserved
girl
was
never
chary
of
letting
her
lover
discover
how
much
she
admired
him
she
never
once
held
an
idea
in
opposition
to
any
one
of
his
or
insisted
on
any
point
with
him
or
showed
any
independence
or
held
her
own
on
any
subject
his
lightest
whim
she
respected
and
obeyed
as
law
and
if
expressing
her
opinion
on
a
matter
he
took
up
the
subject
and
differed
from
her
she
instantly
threw
down
her
own
opinion
as
wrong
and
untenable
even
her
ambiguities
and
espieglerie
were
but
media
of
the
same
manifestation
acted
charades
embodying
the
words
of
her
prototype
the
tender
and
susceptible
of
naomi
let
me
find
favour
in
thy
sight
my
lord
for
that
thou
hast
comforted
me
and
for
that
thou
hast
spoken
friendly
unto
thine
she
was
syringing
the
plants
one
wet
day
in
the
greenhouse
knight
was
sitting
under
a
great
observing
the
scene
sometimes
he
looked
out
at
the
rain
from
the
sky
and
then
at
elfride
s
inner
rain
of
larger
drops
which
fell
from
trees
and
shrubs
after
having
previously
hung
from
the
twigs
like
small
silver
fruit
i
must
give
you
something
to
make
you
think
of
me
during
this
autumn
at
your
chambers
she
was
saying
what
shall
it
be
portraits
do
more
harm
than
good
by
selecting
the
worst
expression
of
which
your
face
is
capable
hair
is
unlucky
and
you
don
t
like
something
which
shall
bring
back
to
my
mind
the
many
scenes
we
have
enacted
in
this
conservatory
i
see
what
i
should
prize
very
much
that
dwarf
myrtle
tree
in
the
pot
which
you
have
been
so
carefully
elfride
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
myrtle
i
can
carry
it
comfortably
in
my
hat
box
said
knight
and
i
will
put
it
in
my
window
and
so
it
being
always
before
my
eyes
i
shall
think
of
you
it
so
happened
that
the
myrtle
which
knight
had
singled
out
had
a
peculiar
beginning
and
history
it
had
originally
been
a
twig
worn
in
stephen
smith
s
and
he
had
taken
it
thence
stuck
it
into
the
pot
and
told
her
that
if
it
grew
she
was
to
take
care
of
it
and
keep
it
in
remembrance
of
him
when
he
was
far
away
she
looked
wistfully
at
the
plant
and
a
sense
of
fairness
to
smith
s
memory
caused
her
a
pang
of
regret
that
knight
should
have
asked
for
that
very
one
it
seemed
exceeding
a
common
heartlessness
to
let
it
go
is
there
not
anything
you
like
better
she
said
sadly
that
is
only
an
ordinary
no
i
am
fond
of
seeing
that
she
did
not
take
kindly
to
the
idea
he
said
again
why
do
you
object
to
my
having
that
oh
no
i
don
t
object
precisely
it
was
a
ah
here
s
another
cutting
lately
struck
and
just
as
small
of
a
better
kind
and
with
prettier
leaves
myrtus
that
will
do
nicely
let
it
be
put
in
my
room
that
i
may
not
forget
it
what
romance
attaches
to
the
other
it
was
a
gift
to
the
subject
then
dropped
knight
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
till
on
entering
his
bedroom
in
the
evening
he
found
the
second
myrtle
placed
upon
his
as
he
had
directed
he
stood
for
a
moment
admiring
the
fresh
appearance
of
the
leaves
by
candlelight
and
then
he
thought
of
the
transaction
of
the
day
male
lovers
as
well
as
female
can
be
spoilt
by
too
much
kindness
and
elfride
s
uniform
submissiveness
had
given
knight
a
rather
exacting
manner
at
crises
attached
to
her
as
he
was
why
should
she
have
refused
the
one
i
first
chose
he
now
asked
himself
even
such
slight
opposition
as
she
had
shown
then
was
exceptional
enough
to
make
itself
noticeable
he
was
not
vexed
with
her
in
the
least
the
mere
variation
of
her
way
from
her
usual
ways
kept
him
musing
on
the
subject
because
it
perplexed
him
it
was
a
gift
those
were
her
words
admitting
it
to
be
a
gift
he
thought
she
could
hardly
value
a
mere
friend
more
than
she
valued
him
as
a
lover
and
giving
the
plant
into
his
charge
would
have
made
no
difference
except
indeed
it
was
the
gift
of
a
lover
he
murmured
i
wonder
if
elfride
has
ever
had
a
lover
before
he
said
aloud
as
a
new
idea
quite
this
and
companion
thoughts
were
enough
to
occupy
him
completely
till
he
fell
asleep
rather
later
than
usual
the
next
day
when
they
were
again
alone
he
said
to
her
rather
suddenly
do
you
love
me
more
or
less
elfie
for
what
i
told
you
on
board
the
steamer
you
told
me
so
many
things
she
returned
lifting
her
eyes
to
his
and
smiling
i
mean
the
confession
you
coaxed
out
of
me
that
i
had
never
been
in
the
position
of
lover
it
is
a
satisfaction
i
suppose
to
be
the
first
in
your
heart
she
said
to
him
with
an
attempt
to
continue
her
smiling
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question
now
said
knight
somewhat
awkwardly
i
only
ask
it
in
a
whimsical
way
you
know
not
with
great
seriousness
elfride
you
may
think
it
odd
elfride
tried
desperately
to
keep
the
colour
in
her
face
she
could
not
though
distressed
to
think
that
getting
pale
showed
consciousness
of
deeper
guilt
than
merely
getting
red
oh
no
i
shall
not
think
that
she
said
because
obliged
to
say
something
to
fill
the
pause
which
followed
her
questioner
s
remark
it
is
this
have
you
ever
had
a
lover
i
am
almost
sure
you
have
not
but
have
you
not
as
it
were
a
lover
i
mean
not
worth
mentioning
harry
she
faltered
knight
overstrained
in
sentiment
as
he
knew
the
feeling
to
be
felt
some
sickness
of
heart
still
he
was
a
lover
well
a
sort
of
lover
i
suppose
she
responded
tardily
a
man
i
mean
you
yes
but
only
a
mere
person
and
but
truly
your
lover
yes
a
lover
certainly
he
was
that
yes
he
might
have
been
called
my
knight
said
nothing
to
this
for
a
minute
or
more
and
kept
silent
time
with
his
finger
to
the
tick
of
the
old
library
clock
in
which
room
the
colloquy
was
going
on
you
don
t
mind
harry
do
you
she
said
anxiously
nestling
close
to
him
and
watching
his
face
of
course
i
don
t
seriously
mind
in
reason
a
man
can
not
object
to
such
a
trifle
i
only
thought
you
hadn
t
that
was
however
one
ray
was
abstracted
from
the
glory
about
her
head
but
afterwards
when
knight
was
wandering
by
himself
over
the
bare
and
breezy
hills
and
meditating
on
the
subject
that
ray
suddenly
returned
for
she
might
have
had
a
lover
and
never
have
cared
in
the
least
for
him
she
might
have
used
the
word
improperly
and
meant
admirer
all
the
time
of
course
she
had
been
admired
and
one
man
might
have
made
his
admiration
more
prominent
than
that
of
the
rest
a
very
natural
case
they
were
sitting
on
one
of
the
garden
seats
when
he
found
occasion
to
put
the
supposition
to
the
test
did
you
love
that
lover
or
admirer
of
yours
ever
so
little
elfie
she
murmured
reluctantly
yes
i
think
i
knight
felt
the
same
faint
touch
of
misery
only
a
very
little
he
said
i
am
not
sure
how
but
you
are
sure
darling
you
loved
him
a
little
i
think
i
am
sure
i
loved
him
a
and
not
a
great
deal
elfie
my
love
was
not
supported
by
reverence
for
his
but
elfride
did
you
love
him
deeply
said
knight
restlessly
i
don
t
exactly
know
how
deep
you
mean
by
that
s
you
misapprehend
and
you
have
let
go
my
hand
she
cried
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
harry
don
t
be
severe
with
me
and
don
t
question
me
i
did
not
love
him
as
i
do
you
and
could
it
be
deeply
if
i
did
not
think
him
cleverer
than
myself
for
i
did
not
you
grieve
me
so
much
you
can
t
i
will
not
say
another
word
about
and
you
will
not
think
about
it
either
will
you
i
know
you
think
of
weaknesses
in
me
after
i
am
out
of
your
sight
and
not
knowing
what
they
are
i
can
not
combat
them
i
almost
wish
you
were
of
a
grosser
nature
harry
in
truth
i
do
or
rather
i
wish
i
could
have
the
advantages
such
a
nature
in
you
would
afford
me
and
yet
have
you
as
you
what
advantages
would
they
be
less
anxiety
and
more
security
ordinary
men
are
not
so
delicate
in
their
tastes
as
you
and
where
the
lover
or
husband
is
not
fastidious
and
refined
and
of
a
deep
nature
things
seem
to
go
on
better
i
fancy
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
observe
the
yes
i
suppose
it
is
right
shallowness
has
this
advantage
that
you
can
t
be
drowned
but
i
think
i
ll
have
you
as
you
are
yes
i
will
she
said
winsomely
the
practical
husbands
and
wives
who
take
things
philosophically
are
very
humdrum
are
they
not
yes
it
would
kill
me
quite
you
please
me
best
as
you
even
though
i
wish
you
had
never
cared
for
one
before
me
yes
and
you
must
not
wish
it
don
t
i
ll
try
not
to
so
she
hoped
but
her
heart
was
troubled
if
he
felt
so
deeply
on
this
point
what
would
he
say
did
he
know
all
and
see
it
as
jethway
saw
it
he
would
never
make
her
the
happiest
girl
in
the
world
by
taking
her
to
be
his
own
for
aye
the
thought
enclosed
her
as
a
tomb
whenever
it
presented
itself
to
her
perturbed
brain
she
tried
to
believe
that
jethway
would
never
do
her
such
a
cruel
wrong
as
to
increase
the
bad
appearance
of
her
folly
by
innuendoes
and
concluded
that
concealment
having
been
begun
must
be
persisted
in
if
possible
for
what
he
might
consider
as
bad
as
the
fact
was
her
previous
concealment
of
it
by
strategy
but
elfride
knew
jethway
to
be
her
enemy
and
to
hate
her
it
was
possible
she
would
do
her
worst
and
should
she
do
it
all
might
be
over
would
the
woman
listen
to
reason
and
be
persuaded
not
to
ruin
one
who
had
never
intentionally
harmed
her
it
was
night
in
the
valley
between
endelstow
crags
and
the
shore
the
brook
which
trickled
that
way
to
the
sea
was
distinct
in
its
murmurs
now
and
over
the
line
of
its
course
there
began
to
hang
a
white
riband
of
fog
against
the
sky
on
the
left
hand
of
the
vale
the
black
form
of
the
church
could
be
seen
on
the
other
rose
a
few
trees
and
where
these
were
absent
furze
tufts
as
tall
as
men
on
stems
nearly
as
stout
as
timber
the
shriek
of
some
bird
was
occasionally
heard
as
it
flew
from
its
first
roost
to
seek
a
new
where
it
might
pass
the
night
unmolested
in
the
evening
shade
some
way
down
the
valley
and
under
a
row
of
scrubby
oaks
a
cottage
could
still
be
discerned
it
stood
absolutely
alone
the
house
was
rather
large
and
the
windows
of
some
of
the
rooms
were
nailed
up
with
boards
on
the
outside
which
gave
a
particularly
deserted
appearance
to
the
whole
erection
from
the
front
door
an
irregular
series
of
rough
and
misshapen
steps
cut
in
the
solid
rock
led
down
to
the
edge
of
the
streamlet
which
at
their
extremity
was
hollowed
into
a
basin
through
which
the
water
trickled
this
was
evidently
the
means
of
water
supply
to
the
dweller
or
dwellers
in
the
cottage
a
light
footstep
was
heard
descending
from
the
higher
slopes
of
the
hillside
indistinct
in
the
pathway
appeared
a
moving
female
shape
who
advanced
and
knocked
timidly
at
the
door
no
answer
being
returned
the
knock
was
repeated
with
the
same
result
and
it
was
then
repeated
a
third
time
this
also
was
unsuccessful
from
one
of
the
only
two
windows
on
the
ground
floor
which
were
not
boarded
up
came
rays
of
light
no
shutter
or
curtain
obscuring
the
room
from
the
eyes
of
a
passer
on
the
outside
so
few
walked
that
way
after
nightfall
that
any
such
means
to
secure
secrecy
were
probably
deemed
unnecessary
the
inequality
of
the
rays
falling
upon
the
trees
outside
told
that
the
light
had
its
origin
in
a
flickering
fire
only
the
visitor
after
the
third
knocking
stepped
a
little
to
the
left
in
order
to
gain
a
view
of
the
interior
and
threw
back
the
hood
from
her
face
the
dancing
yellow
sheen
revealed
the
fair
and
anxious
countenance
of
elfride
inside
the
house
this
firelight
was
enough
to
illumine
the
room
distinctly
and
to
show
that
the
furniture
of
the
cottage
was
superior
to
what
might
have
been
expected
from
so
unpromising
an
exterior
it
also
showed
to
elfride
that
the
room
was
empty
beyond
the
light
quiver
and
flap
of
the
flames
nothing
moved
or
was
audible
therein
she
turned
the
handle
and
entered
throwing
off
the
cloak
which
enveloped
her
under
which
she
appeared
without
hat
or
bonnet
and
in
the
sort
of
country
people
ordinarily
dine
in
then
advancing
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
she
called
distinctly
but
somewhat
fearfully
mrs
jethway
no
answer
with
a
look
of
relief
and
regret
combined
denoting
that
ease
came
to
the
heart
and
disappointment
to
the
brain
elfride
paused
for
several
minutes
as
if
undecided
how
to
act
determining
to
wait
she
sat
down
on
a
chair
the
minutes
drew
on
and
after
sitting
on
the
thorns
of
impatience
for
half
an
hour
she
searched
her
pocket
took
therefrom
a
letter
and
tore
off
the
blank
leaf
then
taking
out
a
pencil
she
wrote
upon
the
paper
dear
jethway
i
have
been
to
visit
you
i
wanted
much
to
see
you
but
i
can
not
wait
any
longer
i
came
to
beg
you
not
to
execute
the
threats
you
have
repeated
to
me
do
not
i
beseech
you
jethway
let
any
one
know
i
ran
away
from
home
it
would
ruin
me
with
him
and
break
my
heart
i
will
do
anything
for
you
if
you
will
be
kind
to
me
in
the
name
of
our
common
womanhood
do
not
i
implore
you
make
a
scandal
of
yours
she
folded
the
note
cornerwise
directed
it
and
placed
it
on
the
table
then
again
drawing
the
hood
over
her
curly
head
she
emerged
silently
as
she
had
come
whilst
this
episode
had
been
in
action
at
jethway
s
cottage
knight
had
gone
from
the
into
the
and
found
swancourt
there
alone
elfride
has
vanished
upstairs
or
somewhere
she
said
and
i
have
been
reading
an
article
in
an
old
number
of
the
present
that
i
lighted
on
by
chance
a
short
time
ago
it
is
an
article
you
once
told
us
was
yours
well
harry
with
due
deference
to
your
literary
powers
allow
me
to
say
that
this
effusion
is
all
nonsense
in
my
what
is
it
about
said
knight
taking
up
the
paper
and
reading
there
don
t
get
red
about
it
own
that
experience
has
taught
you
to
be
more
charitable
i
have
never
read
such
unchivalrous
sentiments
in
my
life
from
a
man
i
mean
there
i
forgive
you
it
was
before
you
knew
oh
yes
said
knight
looking
up
i
remember
now
the
text
of
that
sermon
was
not
my
own
at
all
but
was
suggested
to
me
by
a
young
man
named
smith
the
same
whom
i
have
mentioned
to
you
as
coming
from
this
parish
i
thought
the
idea
rather
ingenious
at
the
time
and
enlarged
it
to
the
weight
of
a
few
guineas
because
i
had
nothing
else
in
my
which
idea
do
you
call
the
text
i
am
curious
to
know
well
this
said
knight
somewhat
unwillingly
that
experience
teaches
and
your
sweetheart
no
less
than
your
tailor
is
necessarily
very
imperfect
in
her
duties
if
you
are
her
first
patron
and
conversely
the
sweetheart
who
is
graceful
under
the
initial
kiss
must
be
supposed
to
have
had
some
practice
in
the
and
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
wrote
that
upon
the
strength
of
another
man
s
remark
without
having
tested
it
by
practice
yes
indeed
i
then
i
think
it
was
uncalled
for
and
unfair
and
how
do
you
know
it
is
true
i
expect
you
regret
it
since
you
bring
me
into
a
serious
mood
i
will
speak
candidly
i
do
believe
that
remark
to
be
perfectly
true
and
having
written
it
i
would
defend
it
anywhere
but
i
do
often
regret
having
ever
written
it
as
well
as
others
of
the
sort
i
have
grown
older
since
and
i
find
such
a
tone
of
writing
is
calculated
to
do
harm
in
the
world
every
literary
jack
becomes
a
gentleman
if
he
can
only
pen
a
few
indifferent
satires
upon
womankind
women
themselves
too
have
taken
to
the
trick
and
so
upon
the
whole
i
begin
to
be
rather
ashamed
of
my
ah
henry
you
have
fallen
in
love
since
and
it
makes
a
difference
said
swancourt
with
a
faint
tone
of
banter
that
s
true
but
that
is
not
my
having
found
that
in
a
case
of
your
own
experience
a
goose
was
a
swan
it
seems
absurd
to
deny
such
a
possibility
in
other
men
s
you
can
hit
palpably
cousin
charlotte
said
knight
you
are
like
the
boy
who
puts
a
stone
inside
his
snowball
and
i
shall
play
with
you
no
longer
excuse
me
i
am
going
for
my
evening
though
knight
had
spoken
jestingly
this
incident
and
conversation
had
caused
him
a
sudden
depression
coming
rather
singularly
just
after
his
discovery
that
elfride
had
known
what
it
was
to
love
warmly
before
she
had
known
him
his
mind
dwelt
upon
the
subject
and
the
familiar
pipe
he
smoked
whilst
pacing
up
and
down
the
failed
to
be
a
solace
he
thought
again
of
those
idle
words
hitherto
quite
forgotten
about
the
first
kiss
of
a
girl
and
the
theory
seemed
more
than
reasonable
of
course
their
sting
now
lay
in
their
bearing
on
elfride
elfride
under
knight
s
kiss
had
certainly
been
a
very
different
woman
from
herself
under
stephen
s
whether
for
good
or
for
ill
she
had
marvellously
well
learnt
a
betrothed
lady
s
part
and
the
fascinating
finish
of
her
deportment
in
this
second
campaign
did
probably
arise
from
her
unreserved
encouragement
of
stephen
knight
with
all
the
rapidity
of
jealous
sensitiveness
pounced
upon
some
words
she
had
inadvertently
let
fall
about
an
earring
which
he
had
only
partially
understood
at
the
time
it
was
during
that
initial
kiss
by
the
little
waterfall
we
must
be
careful
i
lost
the
other
by
doing
this
a
flush
which
had
in
it
as
much
of
wounded
pride
as
of
sorrow
passed
over
knight
as
he
thought
of
what
he
had
so
frequently
said
to
her
in
his
simplicity
i
always
meant
to
be
the
first
comer
in
a
woman
s
heart
fresh
lips
or
none
for
how
childishly
blind
he
must
have
seemed
to
this
mere
girl
how
she
must
have
laughed
at
him
inwardly
he
absolutely
writhed
as
he
thought
of
the
confession
she
had
wrung
from
him
on
the
boat
in
the
darkness
of
night
the
one
conception
which
had
sustained
his
dignity
when
drawn
out
of
his
shell
on
that
occasion
that
of
her
charming
ignorance
of
all
such
matters
how
absurd
it
was
this
man
whose
imagination
had
been
fed
up
to
preternatural
size
by
lonely
study
and
silent
observations
of
his
kind
whose
emotions
had
been
drawn
out
long
and
delicate
by
his
seclusion
like
plants
in
a
cellar
was
now
absolutely
in
pain
moreover
several
years
of
poetic
study
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
poetic
efforts
had
tended
to
develop
the
affective
side
of
his
constitution
still
further
in
proportion
to
his
active
faculties
it
was
his
belief
in
the
absolute
newness
of
blandishment
to
elfride
which
had
constituted
her
primary
charm
he
began
to
think
it
was
as
hard
to
be
earliest
in
a
woman
s
heart
as
it
was
to
be
first
in
the
pool
of
bethesda
that
knight
should
have
been
thus
constituted
that
elfride
s
second
lover
should
not
have
been
one
of
the
great
mass
of
bustling
mankind
little
given
to
introspection
whose
might
have
compensated
for
any
lack
of
appreciativeness
was
the
chance
of
things
that
her
throbbing
indiscreet
heart
should
have
to
defend
itself
unaided
against
the
keen
scrutiny
and
logical
power
which
knight
now
that
his
suspicions
were
awakened
would
sooner
or
later
be
sure
to
exercise
against
her
was
her
misfortune
a
miserable
incongruity
was
apparent
in
the
circumstance
of
a
strong
mind
practising
its
unerring
archery
upon
a
heart
which
the
owner
of
that
mind
loved
better
than
his
own
elfride
s
docile
devotion
to
knight
was
now
its
own
enemy
clinging
to
him
so
dependently
she
taught
him
in
time
to
presume
upon
that
devotion
a
lesson
men
are
not
slow
to
learn
a
slight
rebelliousness
occasionally
would
have
done
him
no
harm
and
would
have
been
a
world
of
advantage
to
her
but
she
idolized
him
and
was
proud
to
be
his
chapter
xxxi
a
worm
i
the
one
day
the
reviewer
said
let
us
go
to
the
cliffs
again
elfride
and
without
consulting
her
wishes
he
moved
as
if
to
start
at
once
the
cliff
of
our
dreadful
adventure
she
inquired
with
a
shudder
death
stares
me
in
the
face
in
the
person
of
that
nevertheless
so
entirely
had
she
sunk
her
individuality
in
his
that
the
remark
was
not
uttered
as
an
expostulation
and
she
immediately
prepared
to
accompany
him
no
not
that
place
said
knight
it
is
ghastly
to
me
too
that
other
i
mean
what
is
its
name
windy
windy
beak
was
the
second
cliff
in
height
along
that
coast
and
as
is
frequently
the
case
with
the
natural
features
of
the
globe
no
less
than
with
the
intellectual
features
of
men
it
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
the
first
moreover
it
was
the
cliff
to
which
elfride
had
ridden
with
stephen
smith
on
a
morning
of
his
summer
visit
so
though
thought
of
the
former
cliff
had
caused
her
to
shudder
at
the
perils
to
which
her
lover
and
herself
had
there
been
exposed
by
being
associated
with
knight
only
it
was
not
so
objectionable
as
windy
beak
that
place
was
worse
than
gloomy
it
was
a
perpetual
reproach
to
her
but
not
liking
to
refuse
she
said
it
is
further
than
the
other
yes
but
you
can
and
will
you
too
no
i
ll
a
duplicate
of
her
original
arrangement
with
stephen
some
fatality
must
be
hanging
over
her
head
but
she
ceased
objecting
very
well
harry
i
ll
ride
she
said
meekly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
she
was
in
the
saddle
but
how
different
the
mood
from
that
of
the
former
time
she
had
indeed
given
up
her
position
as
queen
of
the
less
to
be
vassal
of
the
greater
here
was
no
showing
off
now
no
scampering
out
of
sight
with
pansy
to
perplex
and
tire
her
companion
no
saucy
remarks
on
la
belle
dame
sans
merci
elfride
was
burdened
with
the
very
intensity
of
her
love
knight
did
most
of
the
talking
along
the
journey
elfride
silently
listened
and
entirely
resigned
herself
to
the
motions
of
the
ambling
horse
upon
which
she
sat
alternately
rising
and
sinking
gently
like
a
sea
bird
upon
a
sea
wave
when
they
had
reached
the
limit
of
a
quadruped
s
possibilities
in
walking
knight
tenderly
lifted
her
from
the
saddle
tied
the
horse
and
rambled
on
with
her
to
the
seat
in
the
rock
knight
sat
down
and
drew
elfride
deftly
beside
him
and
they
looked
over
the
sea
two
or
three
degrees
above
that
melancholy
and
eternally
level
line
the
ocean
horizon
hung
a
sun
of
brass
with
no
visible
rays
in
a
sky
of
ashen
hue
it
was
a
sky
the
sun
did
not
illuminate
or
enkindle
as
is
usual
at
sunsets
this
sheet
of
sky
was
met
by
the
salt
mass
of
gray
water
flecked
here
and
there
with
white
a
waft
of
dampness
occasionally
rose
to
their
faces
which
was
probably
rarefied
spray
from
the
blows
of
the
sea
upon
the
foot
of
the
cliff
elfride
wished
it
could
be
a
longer
time
ago
that
she
had
sat
there
with
stephen
as
her
lover
and
agreed
to
be
his
wife
the
significant
closeness
of
that
time
to
the
present
was
another
item
to
add
to
the
list
of
passionate
fears
which
were
chronic
with
her
now
yet
knight
was
very
tender
this
evening
and
sustained
her
close
to
him
as
they
sat
not
a
word
had
been
uttered
by
either
since
sitting
down
when
knight
said
musingly
looking
still
afar
i
wonder
if
any
lovers
in
past
years
ever
sat
here
with
arms
locked
as
we
do
now
probably
they
have
for
the
place
seems
formed
for
a
her
recollection
of
a
pair
who
had
and
the
loss
which
had
ensued
therefrom
and
how
the
young
man
had
been
sent
back
to
look
for
the
missing
article
led
elfride
to
glance
down
to
her
side
and
behind
her
back
many
people
who
lose
a
trinket
involuntarily
give
a
momentary
look
for
it
in
passing
the
spot
ever
so
long
afterwards
they
do
not
often
find
it
elfride
in
turning
her
head
saw
something
shine
weakly
from
a
crevice
in
the
rocky
sedile
only
for
a
few
minutes
during
the
day
did
the
sun
light
the
alcove
to
its
innermost
rifts
and
slits
but
these
were
the
minutes
now
and
its
level
rays
did
elfride
the
good
or
evil
turn
of
revealing
the
lost
ornament
elfride
s
thoughts
instantly
reverted
to
the
words
she
had
unintentionally
uttered
upon
what
had
been
going
on
when
the
earring
was
lost
and
she
was
immediately
seized
with
a
misgiving
that
knight
on
seeing
the
object
would
be
reminded
of
her
words
her
instinctive
act
therefore
was
to
secure
it
privately
it
was
so
deep
in
the
crack
that
elfride
could
not
pull
it
out
with
her
hand
though
she
made
several
surreptitious
trials
what
are
you
doing
elfie
said
knight
noticing
her
attempts
and
looking
behind
him
likewise
she
had
relinquished
the
endeavour
but
too
late
knight
peered
into
the
joint
from
which
her
hand
had
been
withdrawn
and
saw
what
she
had
seen
he
instantly
took
a
penknife
from
his
pocket
and
by
dint
of
probing
and
scraping
brought
the
earring
out
upon
open
ground
it
is
not
yours
surely
he
inquired
yes
it
is
she
said
quietly
well
that
is
a
most
extraordinary
thing
that
we
should
find
it
like
this
knight
then
remembered
more
circumstances
what
is
it
the
one
you
have
told
me
of
the
unfortunate
remark
of
hers
at
the
kiss
came
into
his
mind
if
eyes
were
ever
an
index
to
be
trusted
trying
to
repress
the
words
he
yet
spoke
on
the
subject
more
to
obtain
assurance
that
what
it
had
seemed
to
imply
was
not
true
than
from
a
wish
to
pry
into
bygones
were
you
really
engaged
to
be
married
to
that
lover
he
said
looking
straight
forward
at
the
sea
again
yes
but
not
exactly
yet
i
think
i
o
elfride
engaged
to
be
married
he
murmured
it
would
have
been
called
a
secret
engagement
i
suppose
but
don
t
look
so
disappointed
don
t
blame
no
why
do
you
say
no
no
in
such
a
way
sweetly
enough
but
so
barely
knight
made
no
direct
reply
to
this
elfride
i
told
you
once
he
said
following
out
his
thoughts
that
i
never
kissed
a
woman
as
a
sweetheart
until
i
kissed
you
a
kiss
is
not
much
i
suppose
and
it
happens
to
few
young
people
to
be
able
to
avoid
all
blandishments
and
attentions
except
from
the
one
they
afterwards
marry
but
i
have
peculiar
weaknesses
elfride
and
because
i
have
led
a
peculiar
life
i
must
suffer
for
it
i
suppose
i
had
hoped
well
what
i
had
no
right
to
hope
in
connection
with
you
you
naturally
granted
your
former
lover
the
privileges
you
grant
a
yes
came
from
her
like
the
last
sad
whisper
of
a
breeze
and
he
used
to
kiss
you
of
course
he
and
perhaps
you
allowed
him
a
more
free
manner
in
his
than
i
have
shown
in
no
i
did
this
was
rather
more
alertly
spoken
but
he
adopted
it
without
being
allowed
how
much
i
have
made
of
you
elfride
and
how
i
have
kept
aloof
said
knight
in
deep
and
shaken
tones
so
many
days
and
hours
as
i
have
hoped
in
you
i
have
feared
to
kiss
you
more
than
those
two
times
and
he
made
no
scruples
to
she
crept
closer
to
him
and
trembled
as
if
with
cold
her
dread
that
the
whole
story
with
random
additions
would
become
known
to
him
caused
her
manner
to
be
so
agitated
that
knight
was
alarmed
and
perplexed
into
stillness
the
actual
innocence
which
made
her
think
so
fearfully
of
what
as
the
world
goes
was
not
a
great
matter
magnified
her
apparent
guilt
it
may
have
said
to
knight
that
a
woman
who
was
so
flurried
in
the
preliminaries
must
have
a
dreadful
sequel
to
her
tale
i
know
continued
knight
with
an
indescribable
drag
of
manner
and
intonation
i
know
i
am
absurdly
scrupulous
about
you
that
i
want
you
too
exclusively
mine
in
your
past
before
you
knew
me
from
your
very
cradle
i
wanted
to
think
you
had
been
mine
i
would
make
you
mine
by
main
force
elfride
he
went
on
vehemently
i
can
t
help
this
jealousy
over
you
it
is
my
nature
and
must
be
so
and
i
hate
the
fact
that
you
have
been
caressed
before
yes
hate
it
she
drew
a
long
deep
breath
which
was
half
a
sob
knight
s
face
was
hard
and
he
never
looked
at
her
at
all
still
fixing
his
gaze
far
out
to
sea
which
the
sun
had
now
resigned
to
the
shade
in
high
places
it
is
not
long
from
sunset
to
night
dusk
being
in
a
measure
banished
and
though
only
evening
where
they
sat
it
had
been
twilight
in
the
valleys
for
half
an
hour
upon
the
dull
expanse
of
sea
there
gradually
intensified
itself
into
existence
the
gleam
of
a
distant
when
that
lover
first
kissed
you
elfride
was
it
in
such
a
place
as
this
yes
it
you
don
t
tell
me
anything
but
what
i
wring
out
of
you
why
is
that
why
have
you
suppressed
all
mention
of
this
when
casual
confidences
of
mine
should
have
suggested
confidence
in
return
on
board
the
juliet
why
were
you
so
secret
it
seems
like
being
made
a
fool
of
elfride
to
think
that
when
i
was
teaching
you
how
desirable
it
was
that
we
should
have
no
secrets
from
each
other
you
were
assenting
in
words
but
in
act
contradicting
me
confidence
would
have
been
so
much
more
promising
for
our
happiness
if
you
had
had
confidence
in
me
and
told
me
willingly
i
should
be
different
but
you
suppress
everything
and
i
shall
question
you
did
you
live
at
endelstow
at
that
time
yes
she
said
faintly
where
were
you
when
he
first
kissed
you
sitting
in
this
ah
i
thought
so
said
knight
rising
and
facing
her
and
that
accounts
for
everything
the
exclamation
which
you
explained
deceitfully
and
all
forgive
the
harsh
word
elfride
forgive
he
smiled
a
surface
smile
as
he
continued
what
a
poor
mortal
i
am
to
play
second
fiddle
in
everything
and
to
be
deluded
by
fibs
oh
don
t
say
it
don
t
harry
where
did
he
kiss
you
besides
here
sitting
on
a
tomb
in
the
churchyard
and
other
places
she
answered
with
slow
recklessness
never
mind
never
mind
he
exclaimed
on
seeing
her
tears
and
perturbation
i
don
t
want
to
grieve
you
i
don
t
but
knight
did
care
it
makes
no
difference
you
know
he
continued
seeing
she
did
not
reply
i
feel
cold
said
elfride
shall
we
go
home
yes
it
is
late
in
the
year
to
sit
long
out
of
doors
we
ought
to
be
off
this
ledge
before
it
gets
too
dark
to
let
us
see
our
footing
i
daresay
the
horse
is
knight
spoke
the
merest
commonplace
to
her
now
he
had
hoped
to
the
last
moment
that
she
would
have
volunteered
the
whole
story
of
her
first
attachment
it
grew
more
and
more
distasteful
to
him
that
she
should
have
a
secret
of
this
nature
such
entire
confidence
as
he
had
pictured
as
about
to
exist
between
himself
and
the
innocent
young
wife
who
had
known
no
lover
s
tones
save
his
was
this
its
beginning
he
lifted
her
upon
the
horse
and
they
went
along
constrainedly
the
poison
of
suspicion
was
doing
its
work
well
an
incident
occurred
on
this
homeward
journey
which
was
long
remembered
by
both
as
adding
shade
to
shadow
knight
could
not
keep
from
his
mind
the
words
of
adam
s
reproach
to
eve
in
paradise
lost
and
at
last
whispered
them
to
himself
fool
d
and
beguiled
by
him
thou
i
by
thee
what
did
you
say
elfride
inquired
timorously
it
was
only
a
they
had
now
dropped
into
a
hollow
and
the
church
tower
made
its
appearance
against
the
pale
evening
sky
its
lower
part
being
hidden
by
some
intervening
trees
elfride
being
denied
an
answer
was
looking
at
the
tower
and
trying
to
think
of
some
contrasting
quotation
she
might
use
to
regain
his
tenderness
after
a
little
thought
she
said
in
winning
tones
thou
hast
been
my
hope
and
a
strong
tower
for
me
against
the
they
passed
on
a
few
minutes
later
three
or
four
birds
were
seen
to
fly
out
of
the
tower
the
strong
tower
moves
said
knight
with
surprise
a
corner
of
the
square
mass
swayed
forward
sank
and
vanished
a
loud
rumble
followed
and
a
cloud
of
dust
arose
where
all
had
previously
been
so
clear
the
church
restorers
have
done
it
said
elfride
at
this
minute
swancourt
was
seen
approaching
them
he
came
up
with
a
bustling
demeanour
apparently
much
engrossed
by
some
business
in
hand
we
have
got
the
tower
down
he
exclaimed
it
came
rather
quicker
than
we
intended
it
should
the
first
idea
was
to
take
it
down
stone
by
stone
you
know
in
doing
this
the
crack
widened
considerably
and
it
was
not
believed
safe
for
the
men
to
stand
upon
the
walls
any
longer
then
we
decided
to
undermine
it
and
three
men
set
to
work
at
the
weakest
corner
this
afternoon
they
had
left
off
for
the
evening
intending
to
give
the
final
blow
morning
and
had
been
home
about
half
an
hour
when
down
it
came
a
very
successful
job
a
very
fine
job
indeed
but
he
was
a
tough
old
fellow
in
spite
of
the
here
swancourt
wiped
from
his
face
the
perspiration
his
excitement
had
caused
him
poor
old
tower
said
elfride
yes
i
am
sorry
for
it
said
knight
it
was
an
interesting
piece
of
antiquity
a
local
record
of
local
ah
but
my
dear
sir
we
shall
have
a
new
one
expostulated
swancourt
a
splendid
tower
designed
by
a
london
man
in
the
newest
style
of
gothic
art
and
full
of
christian
indeed
said
knight
oh
yes
not
in
the
barbarous
clumsy
architecture
of
this
neighbourhood
you
see
nothing
so
rough
and
pagan
anywhere
else
in
england
when
the
men
are
gone
i
would
advise
you
to
go
and
see
the
church
before
anything
further
is
done
to
it
you
can
now
sit
in
the
chancel
and
look
down
the
nave
through
the
west
arch
and
through
that
far
out
to
sea
in
fact
said
swancourt
significantly
if
a
wedding
were
performed
at
the
altar
morning
it
might
be
witnessed
from
the
deck
of
a
ship
on
a
voyage
to
the
south
seas
with
a
good
glass
however
after
dinner
when
the
moon
has
risen
go
up
and
see
for
knight
assented
with
feverish
readiness
he
had
decided
within
the
last
few
minutes
that
he
could
not
rest
another
night
without
further
talk
with
elfride
upon
the
subject
which
now
divided
them
he
was
determined
to
know
all
and
relieve
his
disquiet
in
some
way
elfride
would
gladly
have
escaped
further
converse
alone
with
him
that
night
but
it
seemed
inevitable
just
after
moonrise
they
left
the
house
how
little
any
expectation
of
the
moonlight
prospect
which
was
the
ostensible
reason
of
their
pilgrimage
had
to
do
with
knight
s
real
motive
in
getting
the
gentle
girl
again
upon
his
arm
elfride
no
less
than
himself
well
knew
chapter
xxxii
had
i
wist
before
i
kist
it
was
now
october
and
the
night
air
was
chill
after
looking
to
see
that
she
was
well
wrapped
up
knight
took
her
along
the
hillside
path
they
had
ascended
so
many
times
in
each
other
s
company
when
doubt
was
a
thing
unknown
on
reaching
the
church
they
found
that
one
side
of
the
tower
was
as
the
vicar
had
stated
entirely
removed
and
lying
in
the
shape
of
rubbish
at
their
feet
the
tower
on
its
eastern
side
still
was
firm
and
might
have
withstood
the
shock
of
storms
and
the
siege
of
battering
years
for
many
a
generation
even
now
they
entered
by
the
went
eastward
and
sat
down
by
the
the
heavy
arch
spanning
the
junction
of
tower
and
nave
formed
a
black
frame
to
a
distant
misty
view
stretching
far
westward
just
outside
the
arch
came
the
heap
of
fallen
stones
then
a
portion
of
moonlit
churchyard
then
the
wide
and
convex
sea
behind
it
was
a
oeil
which
had
never
been
possible
since
the
mediaeval
masons
first
attached
the
old
tower
to
the
older
church
it
dignified
and
hence
must
be
supposed
to
have
had
an
interest
apart
from
that
of
simple
moonlight
on
ancient
wall
and
sea
and
shore
any
mention
of
which
has
by
this
time
it
is
to
be
feared
become
one
of
the
which
are
heard
but
not
regarded
rays
of
crimson
blue
and
purple
shone
upon
the
twain
from
the
east
window
behind
them
wherein
saints
and
angels
vied
with
each
other
in
primitive
surroundings
of
landscape
and
sky
and
threw
upon
the
pavement
at
the
sitters
feet
a
softer
reproduction
of
the
same
translucent
hues
amid
which
the
shadows
of
the
two
living
heads
of
knight
and
elfride
were
opaque
and
prominent
blots
presently
the
moon
became
covered
by
a
cloud
and
the
iridescence
died
away
there
it
is
gone
said
knight
i
ve
been
thinking
elfride
that
this
place
we
sit
on
is
where
we
may
hope
to
kneel
together
soon
but
i
am
restless
and
uneasy
and
you
know
before
she
replied
the
moonlight
returned
again
irradiating
that
portion
of
churchyard
within
their
view
it
brightened
the
near
part
first
and
against
the
background
which
the
had
not
yet
uncovered
stood
brightest
of
all
a
white
tomb
the
tomb
of
young
jethway
knight
still
alive
on
the
subject
of
elfride
s
secret
thought
of
her
words
concerning
the
kiss
that
it
once
had
occurred
on
a
tomb
in
this
churchyard
elfride
he
said
with
a
superficial
archness
which
did
not
half
cover
an
undercurrent
of
reproach
do
you
know
i
think
you
might
have
told
me
voluntarily
about
that
past
of
kisses
and
betrothing
without
giving
me
so
much
uneasiness
and
trouble
was
that
the
tomb
you
alluded
to
as
having
sat
on
with
him
she
waited
an
instant
yes
she
said
the
correctness
of
his
random
shot
startled
knight
though
considering
that
almost
all
the
other
memorials
in
the
churchyard
were
upright
headstones
upon
which
nobody
could
possibly
sit
it
was
not
so
wonderful
elfride
did
not
even
now
go
on
with
the
explanation
her
exacting
lover
wished
to
have
and
her
reticence
began
to
irritate
him
as
before
he
was
inclined
to
read
her
a
lecture
why
don
t
you
tell
me
all
he
said
somewhat
indignantly
elfride
there
is
not
a
single
subject
upon
which
i
feel
more
strongly
than
upon
this
that
everything
ought
to
be
cleared
up
between
two
persons
before
they
become
husband
and
wife
see
how
desirable
and
wise
such
a
course
is
in
order
to
avoid
disagreeable
contingencies
in
the
form
of
discoveries
afterwards
for
elfride
a
secret
of
no
importance
at
all
may
be
made
the
basis
of
some
fatal
misunderstanding
only
because
it
is
discovered
and
not
confessed
they
say
there
never
was
a
couple
of
whom
one
had
not
some
secret
the
other
never
knew
or
was
intended
to
know
this
may
or
may
not
be
true
but
if
it
be
true
some
have
been
happy
in
spite
rather
than
in
consequence
of
it
if
a
man
were
to
see
another
man
looking
significantly
at
his
wife
and
she
were
blushing
crimson
and
appearing
startled
do
you
think
he
would
be
so
well
satisfied
with
for
instance
her
truthful
explanation
that
once
to
her
great
annoyance
she
accidentally
fainted
into
his
arms
as
if
she
had
said
it
voluntarily
long
ago
before
the
circumstance
occurred
which
forced
it
from
her
suppose
that
admirer
you
spoke
of
in
connection
with
the
tomb
yonder
should
turn
up
and
bother
me
it
would
embitter
our
lives
if
i
were
then
half
in
the
dark
as
i
am
now
knight
spoke
the
latter
sentences
with
growing
force
it
can
not
be
she
said
why
not
he
asked
sharply
elfride
was
distressed
to
find
him
in
so
stern
a
mood
and
she
trembled
in
a
confusion
of
ideas
probably
not
intending
a
wilful
prevarication
she
answered
hurriedly
if
he
s
dead
how
can
you
meet
him
is
he
dead
oh
that
s
different
altogether
said
knight
immensely
relieved
but
let
me
see
what
did
you
say
about
that
tomb
and
him
that
s
his
tomb
she
continued
faintly
what
was
he
who
lies
buried
there
the
man
who
was
your
lover
knight
asked
in
a
distinct
voice
yes
and
i
didn
t
love
him
or
encourage
but
you
let
him
kiss
you
you
said
so
you
know
she
made
no
reply
why
said
knight
recollecting
circumstances
by
degrees
you
surely
said
you
were
in
some
degree
engaged
to
him
and
of
course
you
were
if
he
kissed
you
and
now
you
say
you
never
encouraged
him
and
i
have
been
fancying
you
said
i
am
almost
sure
you
did
that
you
were
sitting
with
him
on
that
tomb
good
god
he
cried
suddenly
starting
up
in
anger
are
you
telling
me
untruths
why
should
you
play
with
me
like
this
i
ll
have
the
right
of
it
elfride
we
shall
never
be
happy
there
s
a
blight
upon
us
or
me
or
you
and
it
must
be
cleared
off
before
we
knight
moved
away
impetuously
as
if
to
leave
her
she
jumped
up
and
clutched
his
arm
don
t
go
harry
don
t
tell
me
then
said
knight
sternly
and
remember
this
no
more
fibs
or
upon
my
soul
i
shall
hate
you
heavens
that
i
should
come
to
this
to
be
made
a
fool
of
by
a
girl
s
untruths
don
t
don
t
treat
me
so
cruelly
o
harry
harry
have
pity
and
withdraw
those
dreadful
words
i
am
truthful
by
nature
i
am
and
i
don
t
know
how
i
came
to
make
you
misunderstand
but
i
was
frightened
she
quivered
so
in
her
perturbation
that
she
shook
him
with
her
note
sentence
incomplete
in
text
did
you
say
you
were
sitting
on
that
tomb
he
asked
moodily
yes
and
it
was
then
how
in
the
name
of
heaven
can
a
man
sit
upon
his
own
tomb
that
was
another
man
forgive
me
harry
won
t
you
what
a
lover
in
the
tomb
and
a
lover
on
it
oh
oh
yes
then
there
were
two
before
me
i
suppose
now
don
t
be
a
silly
woman
with
your
supposing
i
hate
all
that
said
knight
contemptuously
almost
well
we
learn
strange
things
i
don
t
know
what
i
might
have
done
no
man
can
say
into
what
shape
circumstances
may
warp
him
but
i
hardly
think
i
should
have
had
the
conscience
to
accept
the
favours
of
a
new
lover
whilst
sitting
over
the
poor
remains
of
the
old
one
upon
my
soul
i
don
knight
in
moody
meditation
continued
looking
towards
the
tomb
which
stood
staring
them
in
the
face
like
an
avenging
ghost
but
you
wrong
me
oh
so
grievously
she
cried
i
did
not
meditate
any
such
thing
believe
me
harry
i
did
not
it
only
happened
so
quite
of
well
i
suppose
you
didn
t
intend
such
a
thing
he
said
nobody
ever
does
he
sadly
continued
and
him
in
the
grave
i
never
once
i
suppose
the
second
lover
and
you
as
you
sat
there
vowed
to
be
faithful
to
each
other
for
ever
elfride
only
replied
by
quick
heavy
breaths
showing
she
was
on
the
brink
of
a
sob
you
don
t
choose
to
be
anything
but
reserved
then
he
said
imperatively
of
course
we
did
she
responded
of
course
you
seem
to
treat
the
subject
very
lightly
it
is
past
and
is
nothing
to
us
elfride
it
is
a
nothing
which
though
it
may
make
a
careless
man
laugh
can
not
but
make
a
genuine
one
grieve
it
is
a
very
gnawing
pain
tell
me
straight
through
all
of
never
o
harry
how
can
you
expect
it
when
so
little
of
it
makes
you
so
harsh
with
me
now
elfride
listen
to
this
you
know
that
what
you
have
told
only
jars
the
subtler
fancies
in
one
after
all
the
feeling
i
have
about
it
would
be
called
and
is
mere
sentimentality
and
i
don
t
want
you
to
suppose
that
an
ordinary
previous
engagement
of
a
straightforward
kind
would
make
any
practical
difference
in
my
love
or
my
wish
to
make
you
my
wife
but
you
seem
to
have
more
to
tell
and
that
s
where
the
wrong
is
is
there
more
not
much
more
she
wearily
answered
knight
preserved
a
grave
silence
for
a
minute
not
much
more
he
said
at
last
i
should
think
not
indeed
his
voice
assumed
a
low
and
steady
pitch
elfride
you
must
not
mind
my
saying
a
thing
for
say
it
i
shall
it
is
this
that
if
there
were
much
more
to
add
to
an
account
which
already
includes
all
the
particulars
that
a
broken
marriage
engagement
could
possibly
include
with
propriety
it
must
be
some
exceptional
thing
which
might
make
it
impossible
for
me
or
any
one
else
to
love
you
and
marry
knight
s
disturbed
mood
led
him
much
further
than
he
would
have
gone
in
a
quieter
moment
and
even
as
it
was
had
she
been
assertive
to
any
degree
he
would
not
have
been
so
peremptory
and
had
she
been
a
stronger
character
more
practical
and
less
imaginative
she
would
have
made
more
use
of
her
position
in
his
heart
to
influence
him
but
the
confiding
tenderness
which
had
won
him
is
ever
accompanied
by
a
sort
of
to
the
stream
of
events
leading
every
such
woman
to
trust
more
to
the
kindness
of
fate
for
good
results
than
to
any
argument
of
her
own
well
well
he
murmured
cynically
i
won
t
say
it
is
your
fault
it
is
my
i
suppose
i
had
no
real
right
to
question
you
everybody
would
say
it
was
presuming
but
when
we
have
misunderstood
we
feel
injured
by
the
subject
of
our
misunderstanding
you
never
said
you
had
had
nobody
else
here
making
love
to
you
so
why
should
i
blame
you
elfride
i
beg
your
no
no
i
would
rather
have
your
anger
than
that
cool
aggrieved
politeness
do
drop
that
harry
why
should
you
inflict
that
upon
me
it
reduces
me
to
the
level
of
a
mere
you
do
that
with
me
why
not
confidence
for
confidence
yes
but
i
didn
t
ask
you
a
single
question
with
regard
to
your
past
i
didn
t
wish
to
know
about
it
all
i
cared
for
was
that
wherever
you
came
from
whatever
you
had
done
whoever
you
had
loved
you
were
mine
at
last
harry
if
originally
you
had
known
i
had
loved
would
you
never
have
cared
for
me
i
won
t
quite
say
that
though
i
own
that
the
idea
of
your
inexperienced
state
had
a
great
charm
for
me
but
i
think
this
that
if
i
had
known
there
was
any
phase
of
your
past
love
you
would
refuse
to
reveal
if
i
asked
to
know
it
i
should
never
have
loved
elfride
sobbed
bitterly
am
i
such
a
mere
characterless
toy
as
to
have
no
attrac
tion
in
me
apart
from
freshness
haven
t
i
brains
you
said
i
was
clever
and
ingenious
in
my
thoughts
and
isn
t
that
anything
have
i
not
some
beauty
i
think
i
have
a
little
and
i
know
i
have
yes
i
do
you
have
praised
my
voice
and
my
manner
and
my
accomplishments
yet
all
these
together
are
so
much
rubbish
because
i
accidentally
saw
a
man
before
you
oh
come
elfride
accidentally
saw
a
man
is
very
cool
you
loved
him
and
loved
him
a
little
and
refuse
now
to
answer
the
simple
question
how
it
ended
do
you
refuse
still
elfride
you
have
no
right
to
question
me
so
you
said
so
it
is
unfair
trust
me
as
i
trust
that
s
not
at
i
shall
not
love
you
if
you
are
so
cruel
it
is
cruel
to
me
to
argue
like
perhaps
it
is
yes
it
is
i
was
carried
away
by
my
feeling
for
you
heaven
knows
that
i
didn
t
mean
to
but
i
have
loved
you
so
that
i
have
used
you
i
don
t
mind
it
harry
she
instantly
answered
creeping
up
and
nestling
against
him
and
i
will
not
think
at
all
that
you
used
me
harshly
if
you
will
forgive
me
and
not
be
vexed
with
me
any
more
i
do
wish
i
had
been
exactly
as
you
thought
i
was
but
i
could
not
help
it
you
know
if
i
had
only
known
you
had
been
coming
what
a
nunnery
i
would
have
lived
in
to
have
been
good
enough
for
you
well
never
mind
said
knight
and
he
turned
to
go
he
endeavoured
to
speak
sportively
as
they
went
on
diogenes
laertius
says
that
philosophers
used
voluntarily
to
deprive
themselves
of
sight
to
be
uninterrupted
in
their
meditations
men
becoming
lovers
ought
to
do
the
same
why
but
never
mind
i
don
t
want
to
know
don
t
speak
laconically
to
me
she
said
with
deprecation
why
because
they
would
never
then
be
distracted
by
discovering
their
idol
was
she
looked
down
and
sighed
and
they
passed
out
of
the
crumbling
old
place
and
slowly
crossed
to
the
churchyard
entrance
knight
was
not
himself
and
he
could
not
pretend
to
be
she
had
not
told
all
he
supported
her
lightly
over
the
stile
and
was
practically
as
attentive
as
a
lover
could
be
but
there
had
passed
away
a
glory
and
the
dream
was
not
as
it
had
been
of
yore
perhaps
knight
was
not
shaped
by
nature
for
a
marrying
man
perhaps
his
lifelong
constraint
towards
women
which
he
had
attributed
to
accident
was
not
chance
after
all
but
the
natural
result
of
instinctive
acts
so
minute
as
to
be
undiscernible
even
by
himself
or
whether
the
rough
dispelling
of
any
bright
illusion
however
imaginative
depreciates
the
real
and
unexaggerated
brightness
which
appertains
to
its
basis
one
can
not
say
certain
it
was
that
knight
s
disappointment
at
finding
himself
second
or
third
in
the
field
at
elfride
s
momentary
equivoque
and
at
her
reluctance
to
be
candid
brought
him
to
the
verge
of
cynicism
chapter
xxxiii
o

of

wasted
with
a
habit
of
knight
s
when
not
immediately
occupied
with
elfride
to
walk
by
himself
for
half
an
hour
or
so
between
dinner
and
bedtime
had
become
familiar
to
his
friends
at
endelstow
elfride
herself
among
them
when
he
had
helped
her
over
the
stile
she
said
gently
if
you
wish
to
take
your
usual
turn
on
the
hill
harry
i
can
run
down
to
the
house
thank
you
elfie
then
i
think
i
her
form
diminished
to
blackness
in
the
moonlight
and
knight
after
remaining
upon
the
churchyard
stile
a
few
minutes
longer
turned
back
again
towards
the
building
his
usual
course
was
now
to
light
a
cigar
or
pipe
and
indulge
in
a
quiet
meditation
but
his
mind
was
too
tense
to
bethink
itself
of
such
a
solace
he
merely
walked
round
to
the
site
of
the
fallen
tower
and
sat
himself
down
upon
some
of
the
large
stones
which
had
composed
it
until
this
day
when
the
chain
of
circumstance
originated
by
stephen
smith
while
in
the
employ
of
hewby

man
of

had
brought
about

overthrow

on
the
possible
episodes
of
elfride
s
past
life
and
on
how
he
had
supposed
her
to
have
had
no
past
justifying
the
name
he
sat
and
regarded
the
white
tomb
of
young
jethway
now
close
in
front
of
him
the
sea
though
comparatively
placid
could
as
usual
be
heard
from
this
point
along
the
whole
distance
between
promontories
to
the
right
and
left
floundering
and
entangling
itself
among
the
insulated
stacks
of
rock
which
dotted
the
water
s
edge
the
miserable
skeletons
of
tortured
old
cliffs
that
would
not
even
yet
succumb
to
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
tides
as
a
change
from
thoughts
not
of
a
very
cheerful
kind
knight
attempted
exertion
he
stood
up
and
prepared
to
ascend
to
the
summit
of
the
ruinous
heap
of
stones
from
which
a
more
extended
outlook
was
obtainable
than
from
the
ground
he
stretched
out
his
arm
to
seize
the
projecting
arris
of
a
larger
block
than
ordinary
and
so
help
himself
up
when
his
hand
lighted
plump
upon
a
substance
differing
in
the
greatest
possible
degree
from
what
he
had
expected
to
seize
hard
stone
it
was
stringy
and
entangled
and
trailed
upon
the
stone
the
deep
shadow
from
the
aisle
wall
prevented
his
seeing
anything
here
distinctly
and
he
began
guessing
as
a
necessity
it
is
a
tressy
species
of
moss
or
lichen
he
said
to
himself
but
it
lay
loosely
over
the
stone
it
is
a
tuft
of
grass
he
said
but
it
lacked
the
roughness
and
humidity
of
the
finest
grass
it
is
a
mason
s
such
brushes
he
remembered
were
more
bristly
and
however
much
used
in
repairing
a
structure
would
not
be
required
in
pulling
one
down
he
said
it
must
be
a
thready
silk
he
felt
further
in
it
was
somewhat
warm
knight
instantly
felt
somewhat
cold
to
find
the
coldness
of
inanimate
matter
where
you
expect
warmth
is
startling
enough
but
a
colder
temperature
than
that
of
the
body
being
rather
the
rule
than
the
exception
in
common
substances
it
hardly
conveys
such
a
shock
to
the
system
as
finding
warmth
where
utter
frigidity
is
anticipated
god
only
knows
what
it
is
he
said
he
felt
further
and
in
the
course
of
a
minute
put
his
hand
upon
a
human
head
the
head
was
warm
but
motionless
the
thready
mass
was
the
hair
of
the
head
long
and
straggling
showing
that
the
head
was
a
woman
s
knight
in
his
perplexity
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
collected
his
thoughts
the
vicar
s
account
of
the
fall
of
the
tower
was
that
the
workmen
had
been
undermining
it
all
the
day
and
had
left
in
the
evening
intending
to
give
the
finishing
stroke
the
next
morning
half
an
hour
after
they
had
gone
the
undermined
angle
came
down
the
woman
who
was
half
buried
as
it
seemed
must
have
been
beneath
it
at
the
moment
of
the
fall
knight
leapt
up
and
began
endeavouring
to
remove
the
rubbish
with
his
hands
the
heap
overlying
the
body
was
for
the
most
part
fine
and
dusty
but
in
immense
quantity
it
would
be
a
saving
of
time
to
run
for
assistance
he
crossed
to
the
churchyard
wall
and
hastened
down
the
hill
a
little
way
down
an
intersecting
road
passed
over
a
small
ridge
which
now
showed
up
darkly
against
the
moon
and
this
road
here
formed
a
kind
of
notch
in
the
at
the
moment
that
knight
arrived
at
the
crossing
he
beheld
a
man
on
this
eminence
coming
towards
him
knight
turned
aside
and
met
the
stranger
there
has
been
an
accident
at
the
church
said
knight
without
preface
the
tower
has
fallen
on
somebody
who
has
been
lying
there
ever
since
will
you
come
and
help
that
i
will
said
the
man
it
is
a
woman
said
knight
as
they
hurried
back
and
i
think
we
two
are
enough
to
extricate
her
do
you
know
of
a
shovel
the
shovels
are
about
somewhere
they
used
to
stay
in
the
and
there
must
be
some
belonging
to
the
they
searched
about
and
in
an
angle
of
the
porch
found
three
carefully
stowed
away
going
round
to
the
west
end
knight
signified
the
spot
of
the
tragedy
we
ought
to
have
brought
a
lantern
he
exclaimed
but
we
may
be
able
to
do
he
set
to
work
removing
the
superincumbent
mass
the
other
man
who
looked
on
somewhat
helplessly
at
first
now
followed
the
example
of
knight
s
activity
and
removed
the
larger
stones
which
were
mingled
with
the
rubbish
but
with
all
their
efforts
it
was
quite
ten
minutes
before
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
creature
could
be
extricated
they
lifted
her
as
carefully
as
they
could
breathlessly
carried
her
to
felix
jethway
s
tomb
which
was
only
a
few
steps
westward
and
laid
her
thereon
is
she
dead
indeed
said
the
stranger
she
appears
to
be
said
knight
which
is
the
nearest
house
the
vicarage
i
yes
but
since
we
shall
have
to
call
a
surgeon
from
castle
boterel
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
carry
her
in
that
direction
instead
of
away
from
the
and
is
it
not
much
further
to
the
first
house
we
come
to
going
that
way
than
to
the
vicarage
or
to
the
crags
not
much
the
stranger
replied
suppose
we
take
her
there
then
and
i
think
the
best
way
to
do
it
would
be
thus
if
you
don
t
mind
joining
hands
with
not
in
the
least
i
am
glad
to
making
a
kind
of
cradle
by
clasping
their
hands
crosswise
under
the
inanimate
woman
they
lifted
her
and
walked
on
side
by
side
down
a
path
indicated
by
the
stranger
who
appeared
to
know
the
locality
well
i
had
been
sitting
in
the
church
for
nearly
an
hour
knight
resumed
when
they
were
out
of
the
churchyard
afterwards
i
walked
round
to
the
site
of
the
fallen
tower
and
so
found
her
it
is
painful
to
think
i
unconsciously
wasted
so
much
time
in
the
very
presence
of
a
perishing
flying
the
tower
fell
at
dusk
did
it
not
quite
two
hours
ago
i
think
yes
she
must
have
been
there
alone
what
could
have
been
her
object
in
visiting
the
churchyard
then
it
is
difficult
to
the
stranger
looked
inquiringly
into
the
reclining
face
of
the
motionless
form
they
bore
would
you
turn
her
round
for
a
moment
so
that
the
light
shines
on
her
face
he
said
they
turned
her
face
to
the
moon
and
the
man
looked
closer
into
her
features
why
i
know
her
he
exclaimed
who
is
she
mrs
jethway
and
the
cottage
we
are
taking
her
to
is
her
own
she
is
a
widow
and
i
was
speaking
to
her
only
this
afternoon
i
was
at
castle
boterel
and
she
came
there
to
post
a
letter
poor
soul
let
us
hurry
hold
my
wrist
a
little
tighter
was
not
that
tomb
we
laid
her
on
the
tomb
of
her
only
son
yes
it
was
yes
i
see
it
now
she
was
there
to
visit
the
tomb
since
the
death
of
that
son
she
has
been
a
desolate
desponding
woman
always
bewailing
him
she
was
a
farmer
s
wife
very
well
educated
a
governess
originally
i
knight
s
heart
was
moved
to
sympathy
his
own
fortunes
seemed
in
some
strange
way
to
be
interwoven
with
those
of
this
jethway
family
through
the
influence
of
elfride
over
himself
and
the
unfortunate
son
of
that
house
he
made
no
reply
and
they
still
walked
on
she
begins
to
feel
heavy
said
the
stranger
breaking
the
silence
yes
she
does
said
knight
and
after
another
pause
added
i
think
i
have
met
you
before
though
where
i
can
not
recollect
may
i
ask
who
you
are
oh
yes
i
am
lord
luxellian
who
are
you
i
am
a
visitor
at
the
crags
i
have
heard
of
you
and
i
of
you
lord
luxellian
i
am
glad
to
meet
i
may
say
the
same
i
am
familiar
with
your
name
in
and
i
with
yours
is
this
the
house
the
door
was
locked
knight
reflecting
a
moment
searched
the
pocket
of
the
lifeless
woman
and
found
therein
a
large
key
which
on
being
applied
to
the
door
opened
it
easily
the
fire
was
out
but
the
moonlight
entered
the
quarried
window
and
made
patterns
upon
the
floor
the
rays
enabled
them
to
see
that
the
room
into
which
they
had
entered
was
pretty
well
furnished
it
being
the
same
room
that
elfride
had
visited
alone
two
or
three
evenings
earlier
they
deposited
their
still
burden
on
an
couch
which
stood
against
the
wall
and
knight
searched
about
for
a
lamp
or
candle
he
found
a
candle
on
a
shelf
lighted
it
and
placed
it
on
the
table
both
knight
and
lord
luxellian
examined
the
pale
countenance
attentively
and
both
were
nearly
convinced
that
there
was
no
hope
no
marks
of
violence
were
visible
in
the
casual
examination
they
made
i
think
that
as
i
know
where
doctor
granson
lives
said
lord
luxellian
i
had
better
run
for
him
whilst
you
stay
knight
agreed
to
this
lord
luxellian
then
went
off
and
his
hurrying
footsteps
died
away
knight
continued
bending
over
the
body
and
a
few
minutes
longer
of
careful
scrutiny
perfectly
satisfied
him
that
the
woman
was
far
beyond
the
reach
of
the
lancet
and
the
drug
her
extremities
were
already
beginning
to
get
stiff
and
cold
knight
covered
her
face
and
sat
down
the
minutes
went
by
the
essayist
remained
musing
on
all
the
occurrences
of
the
night
his
eyes
were
directed
upon
the
table
and
he
had
seen
for
some
time
that
were
spread
upon
it
he
now
noticed
these
more
particularly
there
were
an
inkstand
pen
and
several
sheets
of
paper
were
thrust
aside
from
the
rest
upon
which
letters
had
been
begun
and
relinquished
as
if
their
form
had
not
been
satisfactory
to
the
writer
a
stick
of
black
and
seal
were
there
too
as
if
the
ordinary
fastening
had
not
been
considered
sufficiently
secure
the
abandoned
sheets
of
paper
lying
as
they
did
open
upon
the
table
made
it
possible
as
he
sat
to
read
the
few
words
written
on
each
one
ran
thus
sir
as
a
woman
who
was
once
blest
with
a
dear
son
of
her
own
i
implore
you
to
accept
a
warning
another
sir
if
you
will
deign
to
receive
warning
from
a
stranger
before
it
is
too
late
to
alter
your
course
listen
to
the
third
sir
with
this
letter
i
enclose
to
you
another
which
unaided
by
any
explanation
from
me
tells
a
startling
tale
i
wish
however
to
add
a
few
words
to
make
your
delusion
yet
more
clear
to
you
it
was
plain
that
after
these
renounced
beginnings
a
fourth
letter
had
been
written
and
despatched
which
had
been
deemed
a
proper
one
upon
the
table
were
two
drops
of
the
stick
from
which
they
were
taken
having
been
laid
down
overhanging
the
edge
of
the
table
the
end
of
it
drooped
showing
that
the
wax
was
placed
there
whilst
warm
there
was
the
chair
in
which
the
writer
had
sat
the
impression
of
the
letter
s
address
upon
the
and
the
poor
widow
who
had
caused
these
results
lying
dead
hard
by
knight
had
seen
enough
to
lead
him
to
the
conclusion
that
jethway
having
matter
of
great
importance
to
communicate
to
some
friend
or
acquaintance
had
written
him
a
very
careful
letter
and
gone
herself
to
post
it
that
she
had
not
returned
to
the
house
from
that
time
of
leaving
it
till
lord
luxellian
and
himself
had
brought
her
back
dead
the
unutterable
melancholy
of
the
whole
scene
as
he
waited
on
silent
and
alone
did
not
altogether
clash
with
the
mood
of
knight
even
though
he
was
the
affianced
of
a
fair
and
winning
girl
and
though
so
lately
he
had
been
in
her
company
whilst
sitting
on
the
remains
of
the
demolished
tower
he
had
defined
a
new
sensation
that
the
lengthened
course
of
inaction
he
had
lately
been
indulging
in
on
elfride
s
account
might
probably
not
be
good
for
him
as
a
man
who
had
work
to
do
it
could
quickly
be
put
an
end
to
by
hastening
on
his
marriage
with
her
knight
in
his
own
opinion
was
one
who
had
missed
his
mark
by
excessive
aiming
having
now
to
a
great
extent
given
up
ideal
ambitions
he
wished
earnestly
to
direct
his
powers
into
a
more
practical
channel
and
thus
correct
the
introspective
tendencies
which
had
never
brought
himself
much
happiness
or
done
his
any
great
good
to
make
a
start
in
this
new
direction
by
marriage
which
since
knowing
elfride
had
been
so
entrancing
an
idea
was
less
exquisite
that
the
curtailment
of
his
illusion
regarding
her
had
something
to
do
with
the
reaction
and
with
the
return
of
his
old
sentiments
on
wasting
time
is
more
than
probable
though
knight
s
heart
had
so
greatly
mastered
him
the
mastery
was
not
so
complete
as
to
be
easily
maintained
in
the
face
of
a
moderate
intellectual
revival
his
reverie
was
broken
by
the
sound
of
wheels
and
a
horse
s
tramp
the
door
opened
to
admit
the
surgeon
lord
luxellian
and
a
coole
coroner
for
the
division
who
had
been
attending
at
castle
boterel
that
very
day
and
was
having
an
chat
with
the
doctor
when
lord
luxellian
arrived
next
came
two
female
nurses
and
some
idlers
granson
after
a
cursory
examination
pronounced
the
woman
dead
from
suffocation
induced
by
intense
pressure
on
the
respiratory
organs
and
arrangements
were
made
that
the
inquiry
should
take
place
on
the
following
morning
before
the
return
of
the
coroner
to
launce
s
shortly
afterwards
the
house
of
the
widow
was
deserted
by
all
its
living
occupants
and
she
abode
in
death
as
she
had
in
her
life
during
the
past
two
years
entirely
alone
chapter
xxxiv
yea
happy
shall
he
be
that
rewardeth
thee
as
thou
hast
served
sixteen
hours
had
passed
knight
was
entering
the
ladies
boudoir
at
the
crags
upon
his
return
from
attending
the
inquest
touching
the
death
of
jethway
elfride
was
not
in
the
apartment
swancourt
made
a
few
inquiries
concerning
the
verdict
and
collateral
circumstances
then
she
said
the
postman
came
this
morning
the
minute
after
you
left
the
house
there
was
only
one
letter
for
you
and
i
have
it
she
took
a
letter
from
the
lid
of
her
workbox
and
handed
it
to
him
knight
took
the
missive
abstractedly
but
struck
by
its
appearance
murmured
a
few
words
and
left
the
room
the
letter
was
fastened
with
a
black
seal
and
the
handwriting
in
which
it
was
addressed
had
lain
under
his
eyes
long
and
prominently
only
the
evening
before
knight
was
greatly
agitated
and
looked
about
for
a
spot
where
he
might
be
secure
from
interruption
it
was
the
season
of
heavy
dews
which
lay
on
the
herbage
in
shady
places
all
the
day
long
nevertheless
he
entered
a
small
patch
of
neglected
enclosed
by
the
shrubbery
and
there
perused
the
letter
which
he
had
opened
on
his
way
thither
the
handwriting
the
seal
the
paper
the
introductory
words
all
had
told
on
the
instant
that
the
letter
had
come
to
him
from
the
hands
of
the
widow
jethway
now
dead
and
cold
he
had
instantly
understood
that
the
unfinished
notes
which
caught
his
eye
yesternight
were
intended
for
nobody
but
himself
he
had
remembered
some
of
the
words
of
elfride
in
her
sleep
on
the
steamer
that
somebody
was
not
to
tell
him
of
something
or
it
would
be
her
ruin
a
circumstance
hitherto
deemed
so
trivial
and
meaningless
that
he
had
forgotten
it
all
these
things
infused
into
him
an
emotion
intense
in
power
and
supremely
distressing
in
quality
the
paper
in
his
hand
quivered
as
he
read
the
valley
endelstow
sir
a
woman
who
has
not
much
in
the
world
to
lose
by
any
censure
this
act
may
bring
upon
her
wishes
to
give
you
some
hints
concerning
a
lady
you
love
if
you
will
deign
to
accept
a
warning
before
it
is
too
late
you
will
notice
what
your
correspondent
has
to
say
you
are
deceived
can
such
a
woman
as
this
be
worthy
one
who
encouraged
an
honest
youth
to
love
her
then
slighted
him
so
that
he
died
one
who
next
took
a
man
of
no
birth
as
a
lover
who
was
forbidden
the
house
by
her
father
one
who
secretly
left
her
home
to
be
married
to
that
man
met
him
and
went
with
him
to
london
one
who
for
some
reason
or
other
returned
again
unmarried
one
who
in
her
with
him
went
so
far
as
to
address
him
as
her
husband
one
who
wrote
the
enclosed
letter
to
ask
me
who
better
than
anybody
else
knows
the
story
to
keep
the
scandal
a
secret
i
hope
soon
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
either
blame
or
praise
but
before
removing
me
god
has
put
it
in
my
power
to
avenge
the
death
of
my
son
gertrude
the
letter
enclosed
was
the
note
in
pencil
that
elfride
had
written
in
jethway
s
cottage
dear
jethway
i
have
been
to
visit
you
i
wanted
much
to
see
you
but
i
can
not
wait
any
longer
i
came
to
beg
you
not
to
execute
the
threats
you
have
repeated
to
me
do
not
i
beseech
you
jethway
let
any
one
know
i
ran
away
from
home
it
would
ruin
me
with
him
and
break
my
heart
i
will
do
anything
for
you
if
you
will
be
kind
to
me
in
the
name
of
our
common
womanhood
do
not
i
implore
you
make
a
scandal
of
yours
e
swancourt
knight
turned
his
head
wearily
towards
the
house
the
ground
rose
rapidly
on
nearing
the
shrubbery
in
which
he
stood
raising
it
almost
to
a
level
with
the
first
floor
of
the
crags
elfride
s
lay
in
the
salient
angle
in
this
direction
and
it
was
lighted
by
two
windows
in
such
a
position
that
from
knight
s
his
sight
passed
through
both
windows
and
raked
the
room
elfride
was
there
she
was
pausing
between
the
two
windows
looking
at
her
figure
in
the
she
regarded
herself
long
and
attentively
in
front
turned
flung
back
her
head
and
observed
the
reflection
over
her
shoulder
nobody
can
predicate
as
to
her
object
or
fancy
she
may
have
done
the
deed
in
the
very
abstraction
of
deep
sadness
she
may
have
been
moaning
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
how
unhappy
am
i
but
the
impression
produced
on
knight
was
not
a
good
one
he
dropped
his
eyes
moodily
the
dead
woman
s
letter
had
a
virtue
in
the
accident
of
its
juncture
far
beyond
any
it
intrinsically
exhibited
circumstance
lent
to
evil
words
a
ring
of
pitiless
justice
echoing
from
the
grave
knight
could
not
endure
their
possession
he
tore
the
letter
into
fragments
he
heard
a
brushing
among
the
bushes
behind
and
turning
his
head
he
saw
elfride
following
him
the
fair
girl
looked
in
his
face
with
a
wistful
smile
of
hope
too
forcedly
hopeful
to
displace
the
firmly
established
dread
beneath
it
his
severe
words
of
the
previous
night
still
sat
heavy
upon
her
i
saw
you
from
my
window
harry
she
said
timidly
the
dew
will
make
your
feet
wet
he
observed
as
one
deaf
i
don
t
mind
there
is
danger
in
getting
wet
yes
harry
what
is
the
matter
oh
nothing
shall
i
resume
the
serious
conversation
i
had
with
you
last
night
no
perhaps
not
perhaps
i
had
better
oh
i
can
not
tell
how
wretched
it
all
is
ah
i
wish
you
were
your
own
dear
self
again
and
had
kissed
me
when
i
came
up
why
didn
t
you
ask
me
for
one
why
don
t
you
now
too
free
in
manner
by
half
he
heard
murmur
the
voice
within
him
it
was
that
hateful
conversation
last
night
she
went
on
oh
those
words
last
night
was
a
black
night
for
kiss
i
hate
that
word
don
t
talk
of
kissing
for
god
s
sake
i
should
think
you
might
with
advantage
have
shown
tact
enough
to
keep
back
that
word
kiss
considering
those
you
have
she
became
very
pale
and
a
rigid
and
desolate
charactery
took
possession
of
her
face
that
face
was
so
delicate
and
tender
in
appearance
now
that
one
could
fancy
the
pressure
of
a
finger
upon
it
would
cause
a
livid
spot
knight
walked
on
and
elfride
with
him
silent
and
unopposing
he
opened
a
gate
and
they
entered
a
path
across
a
perhaps
i
intrude
upon
you
she
said
as
he
closed
the
gate
shall
i
go
away
no
listen
to
me
knight
s
voice
was
low
and
unequal
i
have
been
honest
with
you
will
you
be
so
with
me
if
any
strange
connection
has
existed
between
yourself
and
a
predecessor
of
mine
tell
it
now
it
is
better
that
i
know
it
now
even
though
the
knowledge
should
part
us
than
that
i
should
discover
it
in
time
to
come
and
suspicions
have
been
awakened
in
me
i
think
i
will
not
say
how
because
i
despise
the
means
a
discovery
of
any
mystery
of
your
past
would
embitter
our
knight
waited
with
a
slow
manner
of
calmness
his
eyes
were
sad
and
imperative
they
went
farther
along
the
path
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
tell
you
all
she
exclaimed
entreatingly
i
can
t
promise
so
much
depends
upon
what
you
have
to
elfride
could
not
endure
the
silence
which
followed
are
you
not
going
to
love
me
she
burst
out
harry
harry
love
me
and
speak
as
usual
do
i
beseech
you
harry
are
you
going
to
act
fairly
by
me
said
knight
with
rising
anger
or
are
you
not
what
have
i
done
to
you
that
i
should
be
put
off
like
this
be
caught
like
a
bird
in
a
springe
everything
intended
to
be
hidden
from
me
why
is
it
elfride
that
s
what
i
ask
in
their
agitation
they
had
left
the
path
and
were
wandering
among
the
wet
and
obstructive
stubble
without
knowing
or
heeding
it
what
have
i
done
she
faltered
what
how
can
you
ask
what
when
you
know
so
well
you
know
that
i
have
designedly
been
kept
in
ignorance
of
something
attaching
to
you
which
had
i
known
of
it
might
have
altered
all
my
conduct
and
yet
you
say
what
she
drooped
visibly
and
made
no
answer
not
that
i
believe
in
malicious
and
whisperers
not
i
don
t
know
whether
i
do
or
don
t
upon
my
soul
i
can
t
tell
i
know
this
a
religion
was
building
itself
upon
you
in
my
heart
i
looked
into
your
eyes
and
thought
i
saw
there
truth
and
innocence
as
pure
and
perfect
as
ever
embodied
by
god
in
the
flesh
of
woman
perfect
truth
is
too
much
to
expect
but
ordinary
truth
i
will
have
or
nothing
at
all
just
say
then
is
the
matter
you
keep
back
of
the
gravest
importance
or
is
it
not
i
don
t
understand
all
your
meaning
if
i
have
hidden
anything
from
you
it
has
been
because
i
loved
you
so
and
i
feared
feared
to
lose
since
you
are
not
given
to
confidence
i
want
to
ask
you
some
plain
questions
have
i
your
permission
yes
she
said
and
there
came
over
her
face
a
weary
resignation
say
the
harshest
words
you
can
i
will
bear
them
there
is
a
scandal
in
the
air
concerning
you
elfride
and
i
can
not
even
combat
it
without
knowing
definitely
what
it
is
it
may
not
refer
to
you
entirely
or
even
at
knight
trifled
in
the
very
bitterness
of
his
feeling
in
the
time
of
the
french
revolution
pariseau
a
was
beheaded
by
mistake
for
parisot
a
captain
of
the
king
s
guard
i
wish
there
was
another
e
swancourt
in
the
neighbourhood
look
at
he
handed
her
the
letter
she
had
written
and
left
on
the
table
at
jethway
s
she
looked
over
it
vacantly
it
is
not
so
much
as
it
seems
she
pleaded
it
seems
wickedly
deceptive
to
look
at
now
but
it
had
a
much
more
natural
origin
than
you
think
my
sole
wish
was
not
to
endanger
our
love
o
harry
that
was
all
my
idea
it
was
not
much
yes
yes
but
independently
of
the
poor
miserable
creature
s
remarks
it
seems
to
imply
something
what
remarks
those
she
wrote
me
now
torn
to
pieces
elfride
did
you
run
away
with
a
man
you
loved
that
was
the
damnable
statement
has
such
an
accusation
life
in
it
really
truly
elfride
yes
she
whispered
knight
s
countenance
sank
to
be
married
to
him
came
huskily
from
his
lips
yes
oh
forgive
me
i
had
never
seen
you
to
london
yes
but
i
answer
my
questions
say
nothing
else
elfride
did
you
ever
deliberately
try
to
marry
him
in
secret
no
not
but
did
you
do
it
a
feeble
red
passed
over
her
face
yes
she
said
and
after
that
did
you
write
to
him
as
your
husband
and
did
he
address
you
as
his
wife
listen
listen
it
was
do
answer
me
only
answer
me
then
yes
we
her
lips
shook
but
it
was
with
some
little
dignity
that
she
continued
i
would
gladly
have
told
you
for
i
knew
and
know
i
had
done
wrong
but
i
dared
not
i
loved
you
too
well
oh
so
well
you
have
been
everything
in
the
world
to
me
and
you
are
now
will
you
not
forgive
me
it
is
a
melancholy
thought
that
men
who
at
first
will
not
allow
the
verdict
of
perfection
they
pronounce
upon
their
sweethearts
or
wives
to
be
disturbed
by
god
s
own
testimony
to
the
contrary
will
once
suspecting
their
purity
morally
hang
them
upon
evidence
they
would
be
ashamed
to
admit
in
judging
a
dog
the
reluctance
to
tell
which
arose
from
elfride
s
simplicity
in
thinking
herself
so
much
more
culpable
than
she
really
was
had
been
doing
fatal
work
in
knight
s
mind
the
man
of
many
ideas
now
that
his
first
dream
of
impossible
things
was
over
vibrated
too
far
in
the
contrary
direction
and
her
every
movement
of
feature
every
tremor
every
confused
word
was
taken
as
so
much
proof
of
her
unworthiness
elfride
we
must
bid
to
compliment
said
knight
we
must
do
without
politeness
now
look
in
my
face
and
as
you
believe
in
god
above
tell
me
truly
one
thing
more
were
you
away
alone
with
him
did
you
return
home
the
same
day
on
which
you
left
it
the
word
fell
like
a
bolt
and
the
very
land
and
sky
seemed
to
suffer
knight
turned
aside
meantime
elfride
s
countenance
wore
a
look
indicating
utter
despair
of
being
able
to
explain
matters
so
that
they
would
seem
no
more
than
they
really
were
a
despair
which
not
only
relinquishes
the
hope
of
direct
explanation
but
wearily
gives
up
all
collateral
chances
of
extenuation
the
scene
was
engraved
for
years
on
the
retina
of
knight
s
eye
the
dead
and
brown
stubble
the
weeds
among
it
the
distant
belt
of
beeches
shutting
out
the
view
of
the
house
the
leaves
of
which
were
now
red
and
sick
to
death
you
must
forget
me
he
said
we
shall
not
marry
how
much
anguish
passed
into
her
soul
at
those
words
from
him
was
told
by
the
look
of
supreme
torture
she
wore
what
meaning
have
you
harry
you
only
say
so
do
you
she
looked
doubtingly
up
at
him
and
tried
to
laugh
as
if
the
unreality
of
his
words
must
be
unquestionable
you
are
not
in
earnest
i
know
i
hope
you
are
not
surely
i
belong
to
you
and
you
are
going
to
keep
me
for
yours
elfride
i
have
been
speaking
too
roughly
to
you
i
have
said
what
i
ought
only
to
have
thought
i
like
you
and
let
me
give
you
a
word
of
advice
marry
your
man
as
soon
as
you
can
however
weary
of
each
other
you
may
feel
you
belong
to
each
other
and
i
am
not
going
to
step
between
you
do
you
think
i
would
do
you
think
i
could
for
a
moment
if
you
can
not
marry
him
now
and
another
makes
you
his
wife
do
not
reveal
this
secret
to
him
after
marriage
if
you
do
not
before
honesty
would
be
damnation
bewildered
by
his
expressions
she
exclaimed
no
no
i
will
not
be
a
wife
unless
i
am
yours
and
i
must
be
yours
if
we
had
married
but
you
don
t
mean
that
that
you
will
go
away
and
leave
me
and
not
be
anything
more
to
me
oh
you
don
t
convulsive
sobs
took
all
nerve
out
of
her
utterance
she
checked
them
and
continued
to
look
in
his
face
for
the
ray
of
hope
that
was
not
to
be
found
there
i
am
going
indoors
said
knight
you
will
not
follow
me
elfride
i
wish
you
not
oh
no
indeed
i
will
and
then
i
am
going
to
castle
boterel
he
spoke
the
farewell
as
if
it
were
but
for
the
day
lightly
as
he
had
spoken
such
temporary
farewells
many
times
before
and
she
seemed
to
understand
it
as
such
knight
had
not
the
power
to
tell
her
plainly
that
he
was
going
for
ever
he
hardly
knew
for
certain
that
he
was
whether
he
should
rush
back
again
upon
the
current
of
an
irresistible
emotion
or
whether
he
could
sufficiently
conquer
himself
and
her
in
him
to
establish
that
parting
as
a
supreme
farewell
and
present
himself
to
the
world
again
as
no
woman
s
ten
minutes
later
he
had
left
the
house
leaving
directions
that
if
he
did
not
return
in
the
evening
his
luggage
was
to
be
sent
to
his
chambers
in
london
whence
he
intended
to
write
to
swancourt
as
to
the
reasons
of
his
sudden
departure
he
descended
the
valley
and
could
not
forbear
turning
his
head
he
saw
the
and
a
slight
girlish
figure
in
the
midst
of
it
up
against
the
sky
elfride
docile
as
ever
had
hardly
moved
a
step
for
he
had
said
remain
he
looked
and
saw
her
again
he
saw
her
for
weeks
and
months
he
withdrew
his
eyes
from
the
scene
swept
his
hand
across
them
as
if
to
brush
away
the
sight
breathed
a
low
groan
and
went
on
chapter
xxxv
and
wilt
thou
leave
me
thus
say
nay
say
nay
the
scene
shifts
to
knight
s
chambers
in
bede
s
inn
it
was
late
in
the
evening
of
the
day
following
his
departure
from
endelstow
a
drizzling
rain
descended
upon
london
forming
a
humid
and
dreary
halo
over
every
street
the
rain
had
not
yet
been
prevalent
long
enough
to
give
to
rapid
vehicles
that
clear
and
distinct
rattle
which
follows
the
thorough
washing
of
the
stones
by
a
drenching
rain
but
was
just
sufficient
to
make
footway
and
roadway
slippery
adhesive
and
clogging
to
both
feet
and
wheels
knight
was
standing
by
the
fire
looking
into
its
expiring
embers
previously
to
emerging
from
his
door
for
a
dreary
journey
home
to
richmond
his
hat
was
on
and
the
gas
turned
off
the
blind
of
the
window
overlooking
the
alley
was
not
drawn
down
and
with
the
light
from
beneath
which
shone
over
the
ceiling
of
the
room
came
in
place
of
the
usual
babble
only
the
reduced
clatter
and
quick
speech
which
were
the
result
of
necessity
rather
than
choice
whilst
he
thus
stood
waiting
for
the
expiration
of
the
few
minutes
that
were
wanting
to
the
time
for
his
catching
the
train
a
light
tapping
upon
the
door
mingled
with
the
other
sounds
that
reached
his
ears
it
was
so
faint
at
first
that
the
outer
noises
were
almost
sufficient
to
drown
it
finding
it
repeated
knight
crossed
the
lobby
crowded
with
books
and
rubbish
and
opened
the
door
a
woman
closely
muffled
up
but
visibly
of
fragile
build
was
standing
on
the
landing
under
the
gaslight
she
sprang
forward
flung
her
arms
round
knight
s
neck
and
uttered
a
low
cry
o

are
killing

could
not
help
coming
don
t
send
me
away
don
t
forgive
your
elfride
for
coming

love

so
knight
s
agitation
and
astonishment
mastered
him
for
a
few
moments
elfride
he
cried
what
does
this
mean
what
have
you
done
do
not
hurt
me
and
punish
me
oh
do
not
i
couldn
t
help
coming
it
was
killing
me
last
night
when
you
did
not
come
back
i
could
not
bear
it
i
could
not
only
let
me
be
with
you
and
see
your
face
harry
i
don
t
ask
for
her
eyelids
were
hot
heavy
and
thick
with
excessive
weeping
and
the
delicate
of
her
cheeks
was
disfigured
and
inflamed
by
the
constant
chafing
of
the
handkerchief
in
wiping
her
many
tears
who
is
with
you
have
you
come
alone
he
hurriedly
inquired
yes
when
you
did
not
come
last
night
i
sat
up
hoping
you
would
come
and
the
night
was
all
agony
and
i
waited
on
and
on
and
you
did
not
come
then
when
it
was
morning
and
your
letter
said
you
were
gone
i
could
not
endure
it
and
i
ran
away
from
them
to
launce
s
and
came
by
the
train
and
i
have
been
all
day
travelling
to
you
and
you
won
t
make
me
go
away
again
will
you
harry
because
i
shall
always
love
you
till
i
die
yet
it
is
wrong
for
you
to
stay
o
elfride
what
have
you
committed
yourself
to
it
is
ruin
to
your
good
name
to
run
to
me
like
this
has
not
your
first
experience
been
sufficient
to
keep
you
from
these
things
my
name
harry
i
shall
soon
die
and
what
good
will
my
name
be
to
me
then
oh
could
i
but
be
the
man
and
you
the
woman
i
would
not
leave
you
for
such
a
little
fault
as
mine
do
not
think
it
was
so
vile
a
thing
in
me
to
run
away
with
him
ah
how
i
wish
you
could
have
run
away
with
twenty
women
before
you
knew
me
that
i
might
show
you
i
would
think
it
no
fault
but
be
glad
to
get
you
after
them
all
so
that
i
had
you
if
you
only
knew
me
through
and
through
how
true
i
am
harry
can
not
i
be
yours
say
you
love
me
just
the
same
and
don
t
let
me
be
separated
from
you
again
will
you
i
can
not
bear
it
all
the
long
hours
and
days
and
nights
going
on
and
you
not
there
but
away
because
you
hate
me
not
hate
you
elfride
he
said
gently
and
supported
her
with
his
arm
but
you
can
not
stay
here
now
just
at
present
i
i
suppose
i
must
not
i
wish
i
might
i
am
afraid
that
if
you
lose
sight
of
me
something
dark
will
happen
and
we
shall
not
meet
again
harry
if
i
am
not
good
enough
to
be
your
wife
i
wish
i
could
be
your
servant
and
live
with
you
and
not
be
sent
away
never
to
see
you
again
i
don
t
mind
what
it
is
except
that
no
i
can
not
send
you
away
i
can
not
god
knows
what
dark
future
may
arise
out
of
this
evening
s
work
but
i
can
not
send
you
away
you
must
sit
down
and
i
will
endeavour
to
collect
my
thoughts
and
see
what
had
better
be
done
at
that
moment
a
loud
knocking
at
the
house
door
was
heard
by
both
accompanied
by
a
hurried
ringing
of
the
bell
that
echoed
from
attic
to
basement
the
door
was
quickly
opened
and
after
a
few
hasty
words
of
converse
in
the
hall
heavy
footsteps
ascended
the
stairs
the
face
of
swancourt
flushed
grieved
and
stern
appeared
round
the
landing
of
the
staircase
he
came
higher
up
and
stood
beside
them
glancing
over
and
past
knight
with
silent
indignation
he
turned
to
the
trembling
girl
o
elfride
and
have
i
found
you
at
last
are
these
your
tricks
madam
when
will
you
get
rid
of
your
idiocies
and
conduct
yourself
like
a
decent
woman
is
my
family
name
and
house
to
be
disgraced
by
acts
that
would
be
a
scandal
to
a
washerwoman
s
daughter
come
along
madam
come
she
is
so
weary
said
knight
in
a
voice
of
intensest
anguish
mr
swancourt
don
t
be
harsh
with
her
let
me
beg
of
you
to
be
tender
with
her
and
love
her
to
you
sir
said
swancourt
turning
to
him
as
if
by
the
sheer
pressure
of
circumstances
i
have
little
to
say
i
can
only
remark
that
the
sooner
i
can
retire
from
your
presence
the
better
i
shall
be
pleased
why
you
could
not
conduct
your
courtship
of
my
daughter
like
an
honest
man
i
do
not
know
why
she
a
foolish
inexperienced
girl
should
have
been
tempted
to
this
piece
of
folly
i
do
not
know
even
if
she
had
not
known
better
than
to
leave
her
home
you
might
have
i
should
it
is
not
his
fault
he
did
not
tempt
me
papa
i
if
you
wished
the
marriage
broken
off
why
didn
t
you
say
so
plainly
if
you
never
intended
to
marry
why
could
you
not
leave
her
alone
upon
my
soul
it
grates
me
to
the
heart
to
be
obliged
to
think
so
ill
of
a
man
i
thought
my
friend
knight
and
weary
of
his
life
did
not
arouse
himself
to
utter
a
word
in
reply
how
should
he
defend
himself
when
his
defence
was
the
accusation
of
elfride
on
that
account
he
felt
a
miserable
satisfaction
in
letting
her
father
go
on
thinking
and
speaking
wrongfully
it
was
a
faint
ray
of
pleasure
straying
into
the
great
gloominess
of
his
brain
to
think
that
the
vicar
might
never
know
but
that
he
as
her
lover
tempted
her
away
which
seemed
to
be
the
form
swancourt
s
misapprehension
had
taken
now
are
you
coming
said
swancourt
to
her
again
he
took
her
unresisting
hand
drew
it
within
his
arm
and
led
her
down
the
stairs
knight
s
eyes
followed
her
the
last
moment
begetting
in
him
a
frantic
hope
that
she
would
turn
her
head
she
passed
on
and
never
looked
back
he
heard
the
door
open
close
again
the
wheels
of
a
cab
grazed
the
kerbstone
a
murmured
direction
followed
the
door
was
slammed
together
the
wheels
moved
and
they
rolled
away
from
that
hour
of
her
reappearance
a
dreadful
conflict
raged
within
the
breast
of
henry
knight
his
instinct
emotion
affectiveness
or
whatever
it
may
be
called
urged
him
to
stand
forward
seize
upon
elfride
and
be
her
cherisher
and
protector
through
life
then
came
the
devastating
thought
that
elfride
s
childlike
unreasoning
and
indiscreet
act
in
flying
to
him
only
proved
that
the
proprieties
must
be
a
dead
letter
with
her
that
the
unreserve
which
was
really
artlessness
without
ballast
meant
indifference
to
decorum
and
what
so
likely
as
that
such
a
woman
had
been
deceived
in
the
past
he
said
to
himself
in
a
mood
of
the
bitterest
cynicism
the
suspicious
discreet
woman
who
imagines
dark
and
evil
things
of
all
her
is
far
too
shrewd
to
be
deluded
by
man
trusting
beings
like
elfride
are
the
women
who
hours
and
days
went
by
and
knight
remained
inactive
lengthening
time
which
made
fainter
the
power
of
her
presence
strengthened
the
mental
ability
to
reason
her
down
elfride
loved
him
he
knew
and
he
could
not
leave
off
loving
her
but
marry
her
he
would
not
if
she
could
but
be
again
his
own
elfride
the
woman
she
had
seemed
to
be
but
that
woman
was
dead
and
buried
and
he
knew
her
no
more
and
how
could
he
marry
this
elfride
one
who
if
he
had
originally
seen
her
as
she
was
would
have
been
barely
an
interesting
pitiable
acquaintance
in
his
eyes
no
more
it
cankered
his
heart
to
think
he
was
confronted
by
the
closest
instance
of
a
worse
state
of
things
than
any
he
had
assumed
in
the
pleasant
social
philosophy
and
satire
of
his
essays
the
moral
rightness
of
this
man
s
life
was
worthy
of
all
praise
but
in
spite
of
some
intellectual
acumen
knight
had
in
him
a
modicum
of
that
wrongheadedness
which
is
mostly
found
in
scrupulously
honest
people
with
him
truth
seemed
too
clean
and
pure
an
abstraction
to
be
so
hopelessly
churned
in
with
error
as
practical
persons
find
it
having
now
seen
himself
mistaken
in
supposing
elfride
to
be
peerless
nothing
on
earth
could
make
him
believe
she
was
not
so
very
bad
after
all
he
lingered
in
town
a
fortnight
doing
little
else
than
vibrate
between
passion
and
opinions
one
idea
remained
intact
that
it
was
better
elfride
and
himself
should
not
meet
when
he
surveyed
the
volumes
on
his
shelves
few
of
which
had
been
opened
since
elfride
first
took
possession
of
his
heart
their
untouched
and
orderly
arrangement
reproached
him
as
an
apostate
from
the
old
faith
of
his
youth
and
early
manhood
he
had
deserted
those
friends
so
they
seemed
to
say
for
an
unstable
delight
in
a
ductile
woman
which
had
ended
all
in
bitterness
the
spirit
of
verging
on
asceticism
which
had
ever
animated
knight
in
old
times
announced
itself
as
having
departed
with
the
birth
of
love
with
it
having
gone
the
which
had
compensated
for
the
lack
of
poor
little
elfride
instead
of
holding
as
formerly
a
place
in
his
religion
began
to
assume
the
hue
of
a
temptation
perhaps
it
was
human
and
correctly
natural
that
knight
never
once
thought
whether
he
did
not
owe
her
a
little
sacrifice
for
her
unchary
devotion
in
saving
his
life
with
a
consciousness
of
having
thus
like
antony
kissed
away
kingdoms
and
provinces
he
next
considered
how
he
had
revealed
his
higher
secrets
and
intentions
to
her
an
unreserve
he
would
never
have
allowed
himself
with
any
man
living
how
was
it
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
refrain
from
telling
her
of
adumbrations
heretofore
locked
in
the
closest
strongholds
of
his
mind
knight
s
was
a
robust
intellect
which
could
escape
outside
the
atmosphere
of
heart
and
perceive
that
his
own
love
as
well
as
other
people
s
could
be
reduced
by
change
of
scene
and
circumstances
at
the
same
time
the
perception
was
a
superimposed
sorrow
o
last
regret
regret
can
die
but
being
convinced
that
the
death
of
this
regret
was
the
best
thing
for
him
he
did
not
long
shrink
from
attempting
it
he
closed
his
chambers
suspended
his
connection
with
editors
and
left
london
for
the
continent
here
we
will
leave
him
to
wander
without
purpose
beyond
the
nominal
one
of
encouraging
obliviousness
of
elfride
chapter
xxxvi
the
pennie
s
the
jewel
that
beautifies
a
i
can
t
think
what
s
coming
to
these
launce
s
people
at
all
at
with
their
s
do
you
mean
ay
with
their
s
and
shaking
of
hands
asking
me
in
and
tender
inquiries
for
you
these
words
formed
part
of
a
conversation
between
john
smith
and
his
wife
on
a
saturday
evening
in
the
spring
which
followed
knight
s
departure
from
england
stephen
had
long
since
returned
to
india
and
the
persevering
couple
themselves
had
migrated
from
lord
luxellian
s
park
at
endelstow
to
a
comfortable
roadside
dwelling
about
a
mile
out
of
launce
s
where
john
had
opened
a
small
stone
and
slate
yard
in
his
own
name
when
we
came
here
six
months
ago
continued
smith
though
i
had
paid
ready
money
so
many
years
in
the
town
my
friskier
shopkeepers
would
only
speak
over
the
counter
meet
em
in
the
street
after
and
they
d
treat
me
with
staring
ignorance
of
my
look
through
ye
as
through
a
glass
winder
yes
the
brazen
ones
would
the
quiet
and
cool
ones
would
glance
over
the
top
of
my
head
past
my
side
over
my
shoulder
but
never
meet
my
eye
the
would
turn
their
faces
south
if
i
were
coming
east
flit
down
a
passage
if
i
were
about
to
halve
the
pavement
with
them
there
was
the
spruce
young
bookseller
would
play
the
same
tricks
the
butcher
s
daughters
the
upholsterer
s
young
men
hand
in
glove
when
doing
business
out
of
sight
with
you
but
caring
nothing
for
a
old
woman
when
playing
the
genteel
away
from
all
signs
of
their
true
enough
well
tis
all
different
i
d
no
sooner
got
to
market
than
joakes
rushed
up
to
me
in
the
eyes
of
the
town
and
said
my
dear
smith
now
you
must
be
tired
with
your
walk
come
in
and
have
some
lunch
i
insist
upon
it
knowing
you
so
many
years
as
i
have
don
t
you
remember
when
we
used
to
go
looking
for
owls
feathers
together
in
the
castle
ruins
there
s
no
knowing
what
you
may
need
so
i
answered
the
woman
civilly
i
hadn
t
got
to
the
corner
before
that
thriving
young
lawyer
sweet
who
s
quite
the
dandy
ran
after
me
out
of
breath
mrs
smith
he
says
excuse
my
rudeness
but
there
s
a
bramble
on
the
tail
of
your
dress
which
you
ve
dragged
in
from
the
country
allow
me
to
pull
it
off
for
if
you
ll
believe
me
this
was
in
the
very
front
of
the
town
hall
what
s
the
meaning
of
such
sudden
love
for
a
old
woman
can
t
say
unless
tis
repentance
was
there
ever
such
a
fool
as
you
john
did
anybody
ever
repent
with
money
in
s
pocket
and
fifty
years
to
live
now
i
ve
been
thinking
too
said
john
passing
over
the
query
as
hardly
pertinent
that
i
ve
had
more
from
folks
than
i
ever
have
before
since
we
moved
here
why
old
alderman
tope
walked
out
to
the
middle
of
the
street
where
i
was
to
shake
hands
with
me
so
a
did
having
on
my
working
clothes
i
thought
twas
odd
ay
and
there
was
young
who
s
he
why
the
man
in
hill
street
who
plays
and
sells
flutes
trumpets
and
fiddles
and
grand
pehanners
he
was
talking
to
egloskerry
that
very
small
with
money
in
the
funds
i
was
going
by
i
m
sure
without
thinking
or
expecting
a
nod
from
men
of
that
glib
kidney
when
in
my
working
clothes
you
always
will
go
poking
into
town
in
your
working
clothes
beg
you
to
change
how
i
will
tis
no
well
however
i
was
in
my
working
clothes
werrington
saw
me
ah
smith
a
fine
morning
excellent
weather
for
building
says
he
out
as
loud
and
friendly
as
if
i
d
met
him
in
some
deep
hollow
where
he
could
get
nobody
else
to
speak
to
at
all
twas
odd
for
werrington
is
one
of
the
very
ringleaders
of
the
fast
at
that
moment
a
tap
came
to
the
door
the
door
was
immediately
opened
by
smith
in
person
you
ll
excuse
us
i
m
sure
smith
but
this
beautiful
spring
weather
was
too
much
for
us
yes
and
we
could
stay
in
no
longer
and
i
took
trewen
upon
my
arm
directly
we
d
had
a
cup
of
tea
and
out
we
came
and
seeing
your
beautiful
crocuses
in
such
a
bloom
we
ve
taken
the
liberty
to
enter
we
ll
step
round
the
garden
if
you
don
t
not
at
all
said
smith
and
they
walked
round
the
garden
she
lifted
her
hands
in
amazement
directly
their
backs
were
turned
goodness
send
us
grace
who
be
they
said
her
husband
actually
trewen
the
and
his
john
smith
staggered
in
mind
went
out
of
doors
and
looked
over
the
garden
gate
to
collect
his
ideas
he
had
not
been
there
two
minutes
when
wheels
were
heard
and
a
carriage
and
pair
rolled
along
the
road
a
lady
with
the
demeanour
of
a
duchess
reclined
within
when
opposite
smith
s
gate
she
turned
her
head
and
instantly
commanded
the
coachman
to
stop
ah
smith
i
am
glad
to
see
you
looking
so
well
i
could
not
help
stopping
a
moment
to
congratulate
you
and
smith
upon
the
happiness
you
must
enjoy
joseph
you
may
drive
and
the
carriage
rolled
away
towards
launce
s
out
rushed
smith
from
behind
a
where
she
had
stood
pondering
just
going
to
touch
my
hat
to
her
said
john
just
for
all
the
world
as
i
would
have
to
poor
lady
luxellian
years
lord
who
is
she
the
woman
what
s
her
name
at
the
woman
the
clumsiness
of
the
smith
family
you
might
say
the
landlady
of
the
falcon
hotel
since
we
are
in
for
politeness
the
people
are
ridiculous
enough
but
give
them
their
the
possibility
is
that
smith
was
getting
mollified
in
spite
of
herself
by
these
remarkably
friendly
phenomena
among
the
people
of
launce
s
and
in
justice
to
them
it
was
quite
desirable
that
she
should
do
so
the
interest
which
the
unpractised
ones
of
this
town
expressed
so
grotesquely
was
genuine
of
its
kind
and
equal
in
intrinsic
worth
to
the
more
polished
smiles
of
larger
communities
by
this
time
and
trewen
were
returning
from
the
garden
i
ll
ask
em
flat
whispered
john
to
his
wife
i
ll
say
we
be
in
a
fog
you
ll
excuse
my
asking
a
question
and
trewen
how
is
it
you
all
be
so
friendly
hey
twould
sound
right
and
sensible
wouldn
t
it
not
a
word
good
mercy
when
will
the
man
have
manners
it
must
be
a
proud
moment
for
you
i
am
sure
and
smith
to
have
a
son
so
celebrated
said
the
advancing
ah
tis
stephen
i
knew
it
said
smith
triumphantly
to
herself
we
don
t
know
particulars
said
john
not
know
why
tis
all
over
town
our
worthy
mayor
alluded
to
it
in
a
speech
at
the
dinner
last
night
of
the
and
what
about
stephen
urged
smith
why
your
son
has
been
feted
by
and
parsee
princes
and
in
india
is
hand
in
glove
with
nabobs
and
is
to
design
a
large
palace
and
cathedral
and
hospitals
colleges
halls
and
fortifications
by
the
general
consent
of
the
ruling
powers
christian
and
pagan
twas
sure
to
come
to
the
boy
said
smith
unassumingly
tis
in
yesterday
s
launce
s
chronicle
and
our
worthy
mayor
in
the
chair
introduced
the
subject
into
his
speech
last
night
in
a
masterly
twas
very
good
of
the
worthy
mayor
in
the
chair
i
m
sure
said
stephen
s
mother
i
hope
the
boy
will
have
the
sense
to
keep
what
he
s
got
but
as
for
men
they
are
a
simple
sex
some
woman
will
hook
well
and
smith
the
evening
closes
in
and
we
must
be
going
and
remember
this
that
every
saturday
when
you
come
in
to
market
you
are
to
make
our
house
as
your
own
there
will
be
always
a
and
saucer
for
you
as
you
know
there
has
been
for
months
though
you
may
have
forgotten
it
i
m
a
woman
and
what
i
say
i
when
the
visitors
were
gone
and
the
sun
had
set
and
the
moon
s
rays
were
just
beginning
to
assert
themselves
upon
the
walls
of
the
dwelling
john
smith
and
his
wife
sat
dawn
to
the
newspaper
they
had
hastily
procured
from
the
town
and
when
the
reading
was
done
they
considered
how
best
to
meet
the
new
social
requirements
settling
upon
them
which
smith
considered
could
be
done
by
new
furniture
and
house
enlargement
alone
and
john
mind
one
thing
she
said
in
conclusion
in
writing
to
stephen
never
by
any
means
mention
the
name
of
elfride
swancourt
again
we
ve
left
the
place
and
know
no
more
about
her
except
by
hearsay
he
seems
to
be
getting
free
of
her
and
glad
am
i
for
it
it
was
a
cloudy
hour
for
him
when
he
first
set
eyes
upon
the
girl
that
family
s
been
no
good
to
him
first
or
last
so
let
them
keep
their
blood
to
themselves
if
they
want
to
he
thinks
of
her
i
know
but
not
so
hopelessly
so
don
t
try
to
know
anything
about
her
and
we
can
t
answer
his
questions
she
may
die
out
of
his
mind
that
shall
be
it
said
john
chapter
xxxvii
after
many
knight
roamed
south
under
colour
of
studying
continental
antiquities
he
paced
the
lofty
aisles
of
amiens
loitered
by
ardennes
abbey
climbed
into
the
strange
towers
of
laon
analyzed
noyon
and
rheims
then
he
went
to
chartres
and
examined
its
scaly
spires
and
quaint
carving
then
he
idled
about
coutances
he
rowed
beneath
the
base
of
mont
michel
and
caught
the
varied
skyline
of
the
crumbling
edifices
encrusting
it
ouen
s
rouen
knew
him
for
days
so
did
vezelay
sens
and
many
a
hallowed
monument
besides
abandoning
the
inspection
of
early
french
art
with
the
same
purposeless
haste
as
he
had
shown
in
undertaking
it
he
went
further
and
lingered
about
ferrara
padua
and
pisa
satiated
with
mediaevalism
he
tried
the
roman
forum
next
he
observed
moonlight
and
starlight
effects
by
the
bay
of
naples
he
turned
to
austria
became
enervated
and
depressed
on
hungarian
and
bohemian
plains
and
was
refreshed
again
by
breezes
on
the
declivities
of
the
carpathians
then
he
found
himself
in
greece
he
visited
the
plain
of
marathon
and
strove
to
imagine
the
persian
defeat
to
mars
hill
to
picture
paul
addressing
the
ancient
athenians
to
thermopylae
and
salamis
to
run
through
the
facts
and
traditions
of
the
second
invasion
the
result
of
his
endeavours
being
more
or
less
chaotic
knight
grew
as
weary
of
these
places
as
of
all
others
then
he
felt
the
shock
of
an
earthquake
in
the
ionian
islands
and
went
to
venice
here
he
shot
in
gondolas
up
and
down
the
winding
thoroughfare
of
the
grand
canal
and
loitered
on
calle
and
piazza
at
night
when
the
lagunes
were
undisturbed
by
a
ripple
and
no
sound
was
to
be
heard
but
the
stroke
of
the
midnight
clock
afterwards
he
remained
for
weeks
in
the
museums
galleries
and
libraries
of
vienna
berlin
and
paris
and
thence
came
home
time
thus
rolls
us
on
to
a
february
afternoon
divided
by
fifteen
months
from
the
parting
of
elfride
and
her
lover
in
the
brown
stubble
field
towards
the
sea
two
men
obviously
not
londoners
and
with
a
touch
of
foreignness
in
their
look
met
by
accident
on
one
of
the
gravel
walks
leading
across
hyde
park
the
younger
more
given
to
looking
about
him
than
his
fellow
saw
and
noticed
the
approach
of
his
senior
some
time
before
the
latter
had
raised
his
eyes
from
the
ground
upon
which
they
were
bent
in
an
abstracted
gaze
that
seemed
habitual
with
him
mr
knight
indeed
it
is
exclaimed
the
younger
man
ah
stephen
smith
said
knight
simultaneous
operations
might
now
have
been
observed
progressing
in
both
the
result
being
that
an
expression
less
frank
and
impulsive
than
the
first
took
possession
of
their
features
it
was
manifest
that
the
next
words
uttered
were
a
superficial
covering
to
constraint
on
both
sides
have
you
been
in
england
long
said
knight
only
two
days
said
smith
india
ever
since
nearly
ever
they
were
making
a
fuss
about
you
at
launce
s
last
year
i
fancy
i
saw
something
of
the
sort
in
the
yes
i
believe
something
was
said
about
i
must
congratulate
you
on
your
thanks
but
they
are
nothing
very
extraordinary
a
natural
professional
progress
where
there
was
no
there
followed
that
want
of
words
which
will
always
assert
itself
between
nominal
friends
who
find
they
have
ceased
to
be
real
ones
and
have
not
yet
sunk
to
the
level
of
mere
acquaintance
each
looked
up
and
down
the
park
knight
may
possibly
have
borne
in
mind
during
the
intervening
months
stephen
s
manner
towards
him
the
last
time
they
had
met
and
may
have
encouraged
his
former
interest
in
stephen
s
welfare
to
die
out
of
him
as
misplaced
stephen
certainly
was
full
of
the
feelings
begotten
by
the
belief
that
knight
had
taken
away
the
woman
he
loved
so
well
stephen
smith
then
asked
a
question
adopting
a
certain
recklessness
of
manner
and
tone
to
hide
if
possible
the
fact
that
the
subject
was
a
much
greater
one
to
him
than
his
friend
had
ever
supposed
are
you
married
i
am
knight
spoke
in
an
indescribable
tone
of
bitterness
that
was
almost
moroseness
and
i
never
shall
be
he
added
decisively
are
you
no
said
stephen
sadly
and
quietly
like
a
man
in
a
totally
ignorant
whether
or
not
knight
knew
of
his
own
previous
claims
upon
elfride
he
yet
resolved
to
hazard
a
few
more
words
upon
the
topic
which
had
an
aching
fascination
for
him
even
now
then
your
engagement
to
miss
swancourt
came
to
nothing
he
said
you
remember
i
met
you
with
her
once
stephen
s
voice
gave
way
a
little
here
in
defiance
of
his
firmest
will
to
the
contrary
indian
affairs
had
not
yet
lowered
those
emotions
down
to
the
point
of
control
it
was
broken
off
came
quickly
from
knight
engagements
to
marry
often
end
like
that
for
better
or
for
yes
so
they
do
and
what
have
you
been
doing
lately
doing
where
have
you
been
i
can
hardly
tell
you
in
the
main
going
about
europe
and
it
may
perhaps
interest
you
to
know
that
i
have
been
attempting
the
serious
study
of
continental
art
of
the
middle
ages
my
notes
on
each
example
i
visited
are
at
your
service
they
are
of
no
use
to
i
shall
be
glad
with
them
travelling
far
and
near
not
far
said
knight
with
moody
carelessness
you
know
i
daresay
that
sheep
occasionally
become
giddy
hydatids
in
the
head
tis
called
in
which
their
brains
become
eaten
up
and
the
animal
exhibits
the
strange
peculiarity
of
walking
round
and
round
in
a
circle
continually
i
have
travelled
just
in
the
same
way
round
and
round
like
a
giddy
the
reckless
bitter
and
rambling
style
in
which
knight
talked
as
if
rather
to
vent
his
images
than
to
convey
any
ideas
to
stephen
struck
the
young
man
painfully
his
former
friend
s
days
had
become
cankered
in
some
way
knight
was
a
changed
man
he
himself
had
changed
much
but
not
as
knight
had
changed
yesterday
i
came
home
continued
knight
without
having
to
the
best
of
my
belief
imbibed
ideas
worth
you
hamlet
in
morbidness
of
mood
said
stephen
with
regretful
frankness
knight
made
no
reply
do
you
know
stephen
continued
i
could
almost
have
sworn
that
you
would
be
married
before
this
time
from
what
i
saw
knight
s
face
grew
harder
could
you
he
said
stephen
was
powerless
to
forsake
the
depressing
luring
subject
yes
and
i
simply
wonder
at
whom
did
you
expect
me
to
marry
her
i
saw
you
thank
you
for
that
did
she
jilt
you
smith
now
one
word
to
you
knight
returned
steadily
don
t
you
ever
question
me
on
that
subject
i
have
a
reason
for
making
this
request
mind
and
if
you
do
question
me
you
will
not
get
an
oh
i
don
t
for
a
moment
wish
to
ask
what
is
unpleasant
to
you
not
i
had
a
momentary
feeling
that
i
should
like
to
explain
something
on
my
side
and
hear
a
similar
explanation
on
yours
but
let
it
go
let
it
go
by
all
what
would
you
explain
i
lost
the
woman
i
was
going
to
marry
you
have
not
married
as
you
intended
we
might
have
compared
i
have
never
asked
you
a
word
about
your
i
know
and
the
inference
is
quite
the
truth
is
stephen
i
have
doggedly
resolved
never
to
allude
to
the
matter
for
which
i
have
a
very
good
doubtless
as
good
a
reason
as
you
had
for
not
marrying
you
talk
insidiously
i
had
a
good
one
a
miserably
good
one
smith
s
anxiety
urged
him
to
venture
one
more
question
did
she
not
love
you
enough
he
drew
his
breath
in
a
slow
and
attenuated
stream
as
he
waited
in
timorous
hope
for
the
answer
stephen
you
rather
strain
ordinary
courtesy
in
pressing
questions
of
that
kind
after
what
i
have
said
i
can
not
understand
you
at
all
i
must
go
on
why
good
god
exclaimed
stephen
passionately
you
talk
as
if
you
hadn
t
at
all
taken
her
away
from
anybody
who
had
better
claims
to
her
than
you
what
do
you
mean
by
that
said
knight
with
a
puzzled
air
what
have
you
heard
nothing
i
too
must
go
on
if
you
will
go
said
knight
reluctantly
now
you
must
i
suppose
i
am
sure
i
can
not
understand
why
you
behave
nor
i
why
you
do
i
have
always
been
grateful
to
you
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
we
need
never
have
become
so
estranged
as
we
and
have
i
ever
been
anything
but
towards
you
stephen
surely
you
know
that
i
have
not
the
system
of
reserve
began
with
you
you
know
no
no
you
altogether
mistake
our
position
you
were
always
from
the
first
reserved
to
me
though
i
was
confidential
to
you
that
was
i
suppose
the
natural
issue
of
our
differing
positions
in
life
and
when
i
the
pupil
became
reserved
like
you
the
master
you
did
not
like
it
however
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
come
round
and
see
where
are
you
staying
at
the
grosvenor
hotel
so
am
that
s
convenient
not
to
say
odd
well
i
am
detained
in
london
for
a
day
or
two
then
i
am
going
down
to
see
my
father
and
mother
who
live
at
launce
s
now
will
you
see
me
this
evening
i
may
but
i
will
not
promise
i
was
wishing
to
be
alone
for
an
hour
or
two
but
i
shall
know
where
to
find
you
at
any
rate
chapter
xxxviii
jealousy
is
cruel
as
the
stephen
pondered
not
a
little
on
this
meeting
with
his
old
friend
and
exemplar
he
was
grieved
for
amid
all
the
distractions
of
his
latter
years
a
still
small
voice
of
fidelity
to
knight
had
lingered
on
in
him
perhaps
this
staunchness
was
because
knight
ever
treated
him
as
a
mere
disciple
even
to
snubbing
him
sometimes
and
had
at
last
though
unwittingly
inflicted
upon
him
the
greatest
snub
of
all
that
of
taking
away
his
sweetheart
the
emotional
side
of
his
constitution
was
built
rather
after
a
feminine
than
a
male
model
and
that
tremendous
wound
from
knight
s
hand
may
have
tended
to
keep
alive
a
warmth
which
solicitousness
would
have
extinguished
altogether
knight
on
his
part
was
vexed
after
they
had
parted
that
he
had
not
taken
stephen
in
hand
a
little
after
the
old
manner
those
words
which
smith
had
let
fall
concerning
somebody
having
a
prior
claim
to
elfride
would
if
uttered
when
the
man
was
younger
have
provoked
such
a
query
as
come
tell
me
all
about
it
my
lad
from
knight
and
stephen
would
straightway
have
delivered
himself
of
all
he
knew
on
the
subject
stephen
the
ingenuous
boy
though
now
obliterated
externally
by
stephen
the
contriving
man
returned
to
knight
s
memory
vividly
that
afternoon
he
was
at
present
but
a
sojourner
in
london
and
after
attending
to
the
two
or
three
matters
of
business
which
remained
to
be
done
that
day
he
walked
abstractedly
into
the
gloomy
corridors
of
the
british
museum
for
the
previous
to
their
closing
that
meeting
with
smith
had
reunited
the
present
with
the
past
closing
up
the
chasm
of
his
absence
from
england
as
if
it
had
never
existed
until
the
final
circumstances
of
his
previous
time
of
residence
in
london
formed
but
a
yesterday
to
the
circumstances
now
the
conflict
that
then
had
raged
in
him
concerning
elfride
swancourt
revived
strengthened
by
its
sleep
indeed
in
those
many
months
of
absence
though
quelling
the
intention
to
make
her
his
wife
he
had
never
forgotten
that
she
was
the
type
of
woman
adapted
to
his
nature
and
instead
of
trying
to
obliterate
thoughts
of
her
altogether
he
had
grown
to
regard
them
as
an
infirmity
it
was
necessary
to
tolerate
knight
returned
to
his
hotel
much
earlier
in
the
evening
than
he
would
have
done
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
he
did
not
care
to
think
whether
this
arose
from
a
friendly
wish
to
close
the
gap
that
had
slowly
been
widening
between
himself
and
his
earliest
acquaintance
or
from
a
hankering
desire
to
hear
the
meaning
of
the
dark
oracles
stephen
had
hastily
pronounced
betokening
that
he
knew
something
more
of
elfride
than
knight
had
supposed
he
made
a
hasty
dinner
inquired
for
smith
and
soon
was
ushered
into
the
young
man
s
presence
whom
he
found
sitting
in
front
of
a
comfortable
fire
beside
a
table
spread
with
a
few
scientific
periodicals
and
art
reviews
i
have
come
to
you
after
all
said
knight
my
manner
was
odd
this
morning
and
it
seemed
desirable
to
call
but
that
you
had
too
much
sense
to
notice
stephen
i
know
put
it
down
to
my
wanderings
in
france
and
don
t
say
another
word
but
sit
down
i
am
only
too
glad
to
see
you
stephen
would
hardly
have
cared
to
tell
knight
just
then
that
the
minute
before
knight
was
announced
he
had
been
reading
over
some
old
letters
of
elfride
s
they
were
not
many
and
until
had
been
sealed
up
and
stowed
away
in
a
corner
of
his
leather
trunk
with
a
few
other
mementoes
and
relics
which
had
accompanied
him
in
his
travels
the
familiar
sights
and
sounds
of
london
the
meeting
with
his
friend
had
with
him
also
revived
that
sense
of
abiding
continuity
with
regard
to
elfride
and
love
which
his
absence
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
had
to
some
extent
suspended
though
never
ruptured
he
at
first
intended
only
to
look
over
these
letters
on
the
outside
then
he
read
one
then
another
until
the
whole
was
thus
as
a
stimulus
to
sad
memories
he
folded
them
away
again
placed
them
in
his
pocket
and
instead
of
going
on
with
an
examination
into
the
state
of
the
artistic
world
had
remained
musing
on
the
strange
circumstance
that
he
had
returned
to
find
knight
not
the
husband
of
elfride
after
all
the
possibility
of
any
given
gratification
begets
a
cumulative
sense
of
its
necessity
stephen
gave
the
rein
to
his
imagination
and
felt
more
intensely
than
he
had
felt
for
many
months
that
without
elfride
his
life
would
never
be
any
great
pleasure
to
himself
or
honour
to
his
maker
they
sat
by
the
fire
chatting
on
external
and
random
subjects
neither
caring
to
be
the
first
to
approach
the
matter
each
most
longed
to
discuss
on
the
table
with
the
periodicals
lay
two
or
three
one
of
them
being
open
knight
seeing
from
the
exposed
page
that
the
contents
were
sketches
only
began
turning
the
leaves
over
carelessly
with
his
finger
when
some
time
later
stephen
was
out
of
the
room
knight
proceeded
to
pass
the
interval
by
looking
at
the
sketches
more
carefully
the
first
crude
ideas
pertaining
to
dwellings
of
all
kinds
were
roughly
outlined
on
the
different
pages
antiquities
had
been
copied
fragments
of
indian
columns
colossal
statues
and
outlandish
ornament
from
the
temples
of
elephanta
and
kenneri
were
carelessly
intruded
upon
by
outlines
of
modern
doors
windows
roofs
and
household
furniture
everything
in
short
which
comes
within
the
range
of
a
practising
architect
s
experience
who
travels
with
his
eyes
open
among
these
occasionally
appeared
rough
delineations
of
mediaeval
subjects
for
carving
or
illumination
heads
of
virgins
saints
and
prophets
stephen
was
not
professedly
a
draughtsman
but
he
drew
the
human
figure
with
correctness
and
skill
in
its
numerous
repetitions
on
the
sides
and
edges
of
the
leaves
knight
began
to
notice
a
peculiarity
all
the
feminine
saints
had
one
type
of
feature
there
were
large
nimbi
and
small
nimbi
about
their
drooping
heads
but
the
face
was
always
the
same
that
profile
how
well
knight
knew
that
profile
had
there
been
but
one
specimen
of
the
familiar
countenance
he
might
have
passed
over
the
resemblance
as
accidental
but
a
repetition
meant
more
knight
thought
anew
of
smith
s
hasty
words
earlier
in
the
day
and
looked
at
the
sketches
again
and
again
on
the
young
man
s
entry
knight
said
with
palpable
agitation
stephen
who
are
those
intended
for
stephen
looked
over
the
book
with
utter
unconcern
saints
and
angels
done
in
my
leisure
moments
they
were
intended
as
designs
for
the
stained
glass
of
an
english
but
whom
do
you
idealize
by
that
type
of
woman
you
always
adopt
for
the
virgin
and
then
a
thought
raced
along
stephen
s
mind
and
he
looked
up
at
his
friend
the
truth
is
stephen
s
introduction
of
elfride
s
lineaments
had
been
so
unconscious
that
he
had
not
at
first
understood
his
companion
s
drift
the
hand
like
the
tongue
easily
acquires
the
trick
of
repetition
by
rote
without
calling
in
the
mind
to
assist
at
all
and
this
had
been
the
case
here
young
men
who
can
not
write
verses
about
their
loves
generally
take
to
portraying
them
and
in
the
early
days
of
his
attachment
smith
had
never
been
weary
of
outlining
elfride
the
of
stephen
s
sketches
now
initiated
an
adjustment
of
many
things
knight
had
recognized
her
the
opportunity
of
comparing
notes
had
come
unsought
elfride
swancourt
to
whom
i
was
engaged
he
said
quietly
stephen
i
know
what
you
mean
by
speaking
like
was
it
elfride
you
the
man
stephen
yes
and
you
are
thinking
why
did
i
conceal
the
fact
from
you
that
time
at
endelstow
are
you
not
yes
and
more
i
did
it
for
the
best
blame
me
if
you
will
i
did
it
for
the
best
and
now
say
how
could
i
be
with
you
afterwards
as
i
had
been
before
i
don
t
know
at
all
i
can
t
knight
remained
fixed
in
thought
and
once
he
murmured
i
had
a
suspicion
this
afternoon
that
there
might
be
some
such
meaning
in
your
words
about
my
taking
her
away
but
i
dismissed
it
how
came
you
to
know
her
he
presently
asked
in
almost
a
peremptory
tone
i
went
down
about
the
church
years
ago
when
you
were
with
hewby
of
course
of
course
well
i
can
t
understand
his
tones
rose
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
your
hoodwinking
me
like
this
for
so
long
i
don
t
see
that
i
have
hoodwinked
you
at
yes
yes
but
knight
arose
from
his
seat
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
his
face
was
markedly
pale
and
his
voice
perturbed
as
he
said
you
did
not
act
as
i
should
have
acted
towards
you
under
those
circumstances
i
feel
it
deeply
and
i
tell
you
plainly
i
shall
never
forget
it
what
your
behaviour
at
that
meeting
in
the
family
vault
when
i
told
you
we
were
going
to
be
married
deception
dishonesty
everywhere
all
the
world
s
of
a
piece
stephen
did
not
much
like
this
misconstruction
of
his
motives
even
though
it
was
but
the
hasty
conclusion
of
a
friend
disturbed
by
emotion
i
could
do
no
otherwise
than
i
did
with
due
regard
to
her
he
said
stiffly
indeed
said
knight
in
the
bitterest
tone
of
reproach
nor
could
you
with
due
regard
to
her
have
married
her
i
suppose
i
have
hoped
longed
that
he
who
turns
out
to
be
you
would
ultimately
have
done
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
that
hope
but
you
talk
very
mysteriously
i
think
i
had
about
the
best
reason
anybody
could
have
had
for
not
doing
oh
what
reason
was
it
that
i
could
you
ought
to
have
made
an
opportunity
you
ought
to
do
so
now
in
bare
justice
to
her
stephen
cried
knight
carried
beyond
himself
that
you
know
very
well
and
it
hurts
and
wounds
me
more
than
you
dream
to
find
you
never
have
tried
to
make
any
reparation
to
a
woman
of
that
kind
so
trusting
so
apt
to
be
run
away
with
by
her
feelings
poor
little
fool
so
much
the
worse
for
her
why
you
talk
like
a
madman
you
took
her
away
from
me
did
you
not
picking
up
what
another
throws
down
can
scarcely
be
called
taking
however
we
shall
not
agree
too
well
upon
that
subject
so
we
had
better
but
i
am
quite
certain
you
misapprehend
something
most
grievously
said
stephen
shaken
to
the
bottom
of
his
heart
what
have
i
done
tell
me
i
have
lost
elfride
but
is
that
such
a
sin
was
it
her
doing
or
yours
was
what
that
you
i
will
tell
you
honestly
it
was
hers
entirely
what
was
her
reason
i
can
hardly
say
but
i
ll
tell
the
story
without
stephen
until
had
unhesitatingly
held
that
she
grew
tired
of
him
and
turned
to
knight
but
he
did
not
like
to
advance
the
statement
now
or
even
to
think
the
thought
to
fancy
otherwise
accorded
better
with
the
hope
to
which
knight
s
estrangement
had
given
birth
that
love
for
his
friend
was
not
the
direct
cause
but
a
result
of
her
suspension
of
love
for
himself
such
a
matter
must
not
be
allowed
to
breed
discord
between
us
knight
returned
relapsing
into
a
manner
which
concealed
all
his
true
feeling
as
if
confidence
now
was
intolerable
i
do
see
that
your
reticence
towards
me
in
the
vault
may
have
been
dictated
by
prudential
he
concluded
artificially
it
was
a
strange
thing
altogether
but
not
of
much
importance
i
suppose
at
this
distance
of
time
and
it
does
not
concern
me
now
though
i
don
t
mind
hearing
your
these
words
from
knight
uttered
with
such
an
air
of
renunciation
and
apparent
indifference
prompted
smith
to
speak
on
perhaps
with
a
little
complacency
of
his
old
secret
engagement
to
elfride
he
told
the
details
of
its
origin
and
the
peremptory
words
and
actions
of
her
father
to
extinguish
their
love
knight
persevered
in
the
tone
and
manner
of
a
disinterested
outsider
it
had
become
more
than
ever
imperative
to
screen
his
emotions
from
stephen
s
eye
the
young
man
would
otherwise
be
less
frank
and
their
meeting
would
be
again
embittered
what
was
the
use
of
untoward
candour
stephen
had
now
arrived
at
the
point
in
his
ingenuous
narrative
where
he
left
the
vicarage
because
of
her
father
s
manner
knight
s
interest
increased
their
love
seemed
so
innocent
and
childlike
thus
far
it
is
a
nice
point
in
casuistry
he
observed
to
decide
whether
you
were
culpable
or
not
in
not
telling
swancourt
that
your
friends
were
parishioners
of
his
it
was
only
human
nature
to
hold
your
tongue
under
the
circumstances
well
what
was
the
result
of
your
dismissal
by
him
that
we
agreed
to
be
secretly
faithful
and
to
insure
this
we
thought
we
would
knight
s
suspense
and
agitation
rose
higher
when
stephen
entered
upon
this
phase
of
the
subject
do
you
mind
telling
on
he
said
steadying
his
manner
of
speech
oh
not
at
then
stephen
gave
in
full
the
particulars
of
the
meeting
with
elfride
at
the
railway
station
the
necessity
they
were
under
of
going
to
london
unless
the
ceremony
were
to
be
postponed
the
long
journey
of
the
afternoon
and
evening
her
timidity
and
revulsion
of
feeling
its
culmination
on
reaching
london
the
crossing
over
to
the
and
their
immediate
departure
again
solely
in
obedience
to
her
wish
the
journey
all
night
their
anxious
watching
for
the
dawn
their
arrival
at
launce
s
at
last
were
detailed
and
he
told
how
a
village
woman
named
jethway
was
the
only
person
who
recognized
them
either
going
or
coming
and
how
dreadfully
this
terrified
elfride
he
told
how
he
waited
in
the
fields
whilst
this
then
reproachful
sweetheart
went
for
her
pony
and
how
the
last
kiss
he
ever
gave
her
was
given
a
mile
out
of
the
town
on
the
way
to
endelstow
these
things
stephen
related
with
a
will
he
believed
that
in
doing
so
he
established
word
by
word
the
reasonableness
of
his
claim
to
elfride
curse
her
curse
that
woman
that
miserable
letter
that
parted
us
o
god
knight
began
pacing
the
room
again
and
uttered
this
at
further
end
what
did
you
say
said
stephen
turning
round
say
did
i
say
anything
oh
i
was
merely
thinking
about
your
story
and
the
oddness
of
my
having
a
fancy
for
the
same
woman
afterwards
and
that
now
i
i
have
forgotten
her
almost
and
neither
of
us
care
about
her
except
just
as
a
friend
you
know
eh
knight
still
continued
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
somewhat
in
shadow
exactly
said
stephen
inwardly
exultant
for
he
was
really
deceived
by
knight
s
manner
yet
he
was
deceived
less
by
the
completeness
of
knight
s
disguise
than
by
the
persuasive
power
which
lay
in
the
fact
that
knight
had
never
before
deceived
him
in
anything
so
this
supposition
that
his
companion
had
ceased
to
love
elfride
was
an
enormous
lightening
of
the
weight
which
had
turned
the
scale
against
him
admitting
that
elfride
could
love
another
man
after
you
said
the
elder
under
the
same
varnish
of
careless
criticism
she
was
none
the
worse
for
that
the
worse
of
course
she
was
none
the
did
you
ever
think
it
a
wild
and
thoughtless
thing
for
her
to
do
indeed
i
never
did
said
stephen
i
persuaded
her
she
saw
no
harm
in
it
until
she
decided
to
return
nor
did
i
nor
was
there
except
to
the
extent
of
directly
she
thought
it
was
wrong
she
would
go
no
further
that
was
it
i
had
just
begun
to
think
it
wrong
such
a
childish
escapade
might
have
been
misrepresented
by
any
person
might
it
not
it
might
but
i
never
heard
that
it
was
nobody
who
really
knew
all
the
circumstances
would
have
done
otherwise
than
smile
if
all
the
world
had
known
it
elfride
would
still
have
remained
the
only
one
who
thought
her
action
a
sin
poor
child
she
always
persisted
in
thinking
so
and
was
frightened
more
than
stephen
do
you
love
her
now
well
i
like
her
i
always
shall
you
know
he
said
evasively
and
with
all
the
strategy
love
suggested
but
i
have
not
seen
her
for
so
long
that
i
can
hardly
be
expected
to
love
her
do
you
love
her
still
how
shall
i
answer
without
being
ashamed
what
fickle
beings
we
men
are
stephen
men
may
love
strongest
for
a
while
but
women
love
longest
i
used
to
love
her
in
my
way
you
yes
i
understand
ah
and
i
used
to
love
her
in
my
way
in
fact
i
loved
her
a
good
deal
at
one
time
but
travel
has
a
tendency
to
obliterate
early
it
has
it
has
perhaps
the
most
extraordinary
feature
in
this
conversation
was
the
circumstance
that
though
each
interlocutor
had
at
first
his
suspicions
of
the
other
s
abiding
passion
awakened
by
several
little
acts
neither
would
allow
himself
to
see
that
his
friend
might
now
be
speaking
deceitfully
as
well
as
he
resumed
knight
now
that
matters
are
smooth
between
us
i
think
i
must
leave
you
you
won
t
mind
my
hurrying
off
to
my
quarters
you
ll
stay
to
some
sort
of
supper
surely
didn
t
you
come
to
dinner
you
must
really
excuse
me
this
then
you
ll
drop
in
to
breakfast
i
shall
be
rather
pressed
for
an
early
breakfast
which
shall
interfere
with
nothing
i
ll
come
said
knight
with
as
much
readiness
as
it
was
possible
to
graft
upon
a
huge
stock
of
reluctance
yes
early
eight
o
clock
say
as
we
are
under
the
same
any
time
you
like
eight
it
shall
and
knight
left
him
to
wear
a
mask
to
dissemble
his
feelings
as
he
had
in
their
late
miserable
conversation
was
such
torture
that
he
could
support
it
no
longer
it
was
the
first
time
in
knight
s
life
that
he
had
ever
been
so
entirely
the
player
of
a
part
and
the
man
he
had
thus
deceived
was
stephen
who
had
docilely
looked
up
to
him
from
youth
as
a
superior
of
unblemished
integrity
he
went
to
bed
and
allowed
the
fever
of
his
excitement
to
rage
uncontrolled
stephen
it
was
only
he
who
was
the
rival
only
stephen
there
was
an
of
absurdity
which
knight
wretched
and
as
he
was
could
not
help
recognizing
stephen
was
but
a
boy
to
him
where
the
great
grief
lay
was
in
perceiving
that
the
very
innocence
of
elfride
in
reading
her
little
fault
as
one
so
grave
was
what
had
fatally
misled
him
had
elfride
with
any
degree
of
coolness
asserted
that
she
had
done
no
harm
the
poisonous
breath
of
the
dead
jethway
would
have
been
inoperative
why
did
he
not
make
his
little
docile
girl
tell
more
if
on
that
subject
he
had
only
exercised
the
imperativeness
customary
with
him
on
others
all
might
have
been
revealed
it
smote
his
heart
like
a
switch
when
he
remembered
how
gently
she
had
borne
his
scourging
speeches
never
answering
him
with
a
single
reproach
only
assuring
him
of
her
unbounded
love
knight
blessed
elfride
for
her
sweetness
and
forgot
her
fault
he
pictured
with
a
vivid
fancy
those
fair
summer
scenes
with
her
he
again
saw
her
as
at
their
first
meeting
timid
at
speaking
yet
in
her
eagerness
to
be
explanatory
borne
forward
almost
against
her
will
how
she
would
wait
for
him
in
green
places
without
showing
any
of
the
ordinary
womanly
affectations
of
indifference
how
proud
she
was
to
be
seen
walking
with
him
bearing
legibly
in
her
eyes
the
thought
that
he
was
the
greatest
genius
in
the
world
he
formed
a
resolution
and
after
that
could
make
pretence
of
slumber
no
longer
rising
and
dressing
himself
he
sat
down
and
waited
for
day
that
night
stephen
was
restless
too
not
because
of
the
unwontedness
of
a
return
to
english
scenery
not
because
he
was
about
to
meet
his
parents
and
settle
down
for
awhile
to
english
cottage
life
he
was
indulging
in
dreams
and
for
the
nonce
the
warehouses
of
bombay
and
the
plains
and
forts
of
poonah
were
but
a
shadow
s
shadow
his
dream
was
based
on
this
one
atom
of
fact
elfride
and
knight
had
become
separated
and
their
engagement
was
as
if
it
had
never
been
their
rupture
must
have
occurred
soon
after
stephen
s
discovery
of
the
fact
of
their
union
and
stephen
went
on
to
think
what
so
probable
as
that
a
return
of
her
errant
affection
to
himself
was
the
cause
stephen
s
opinions
in
this
matter
were
those
of
a
lover
and
not
the
balanced
judgment
of
an
unbiassed
spectator
his
naturally
sanguine
spirit
built
hope
upon
hope
till
scarcely
a
doubt
remained
in
his
mind
that
her
lingering
tenderness
for
him
had
in
some
way
been
perceived
by
knight
and
had
provoked
their
parting
to
go
and
see
elfride
was
the
suggestion
of
impulses
it
was
impossible
to
withstand
at
any
rate
to
run
down
from
launce
s
to
castle
poterel
a
distance
of
less
than
twenty
miles
and
glide
like
a
ghost
about
their
old
haunts
making
stealthy
inquiries
about
her
would
be
a
fascinating
way
of
passing
the
first
spare
hours
after
reaching
home
on
the
day
after
the
morrow
he
was
now
a
richer
man
than
heretofore
standing
on
his
own
bottom
and
the
definite
position
in
which
he
had
rooted
himself
nullified
old
local
distinctions
he
had
become
illustrious
even
sanguine
clarus
judging
from
the
tone
of
the
worthy
mayor
of
launce
s
chapter
xxxix
each
to
the
loved
one
s
the
friends
and
rivals
breakfasted
together
the
next
morning
not
a
word
was
said
on
either
side
upon
the
matter
discussed
the
previous
evening
so
glibly
and
so
hollowly
stephen
was
absorbed
the
greater
part
of
the
time
in
wishing
he
were
not
forced
to
stay
in
town
yet
another
day
i
don
t
intend
to
leave
for
launce
s
till
as
you
know
he
said
to
knight
at
the
end
of
the
meal
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
yourself
i
have
an
engagement
just
before
ten
said
knight
deliberately
and
after
that
time
i
must
call
upon
two
or
three
i
ll
look
for
you
this
evening
said
stephen
yes
do
you
may
as
well
come
and
dine
with
me
that
is
if
we
can
meet
i
may
not
sleep
in
london
in
fact
i
am
absolutely
unsettled
as
to
my
movements
yet
however
the
first
thing
i
am
going
to
do
is
to
get
my
baggage
shifted
from
this
place
to
bede
s
inn
for
the
present
i
ll
write
you
know
if
i
can
t
meet
it
now
wanted
a
quarter
to
nine
o
clock
when
knight
was
gone
stephen
felt
yet
more
impatient
of
the
circumstance
that
another
day
would
have
to
drag
itself
away
wearily
before
he
could
set
out
for
that
spot
of
earth
whereon
a
soft
thought
of
him
might
perhaps
be
nourished
still
on
a
sudden
he
admitted
to
his
mind
the
possibility
that
the
engagement
he
was
waiting
in
town
to
keep
might
be
postponed
without
much
harm
it
was
no
sooner
perceived
than
attempted
looking
at
his
watch
he
found
it
wanted
forty
minutes
to
the
departure
of
the
ten
o
clock
train
from
paddington
which
left
him
a
surplus
quarter
of
an
hour
before
it
would
be
necessary
to
start
for
the
station
scribbling
a
hasty
note
or
two
one
putting
off
the
business
meeting
another
to
knight
apologizing
for
not
being
able
to
see
him
in
the
evening
paying
his
bill
and
leaving
his
heavier
luggage
to
follow
him
by
he
jumped
into
a
cab
and
rattled
off
to
the
great
western
station
shortly
afterwards
he
took
his
seat
in
the
railway
carriage
the
guard
paused
on
his
whistle
to
let
into
the
next
compartment
to
smith
s
a
man
of
whom
stephen
had
caught
but
a
hasty
glimpse
as
he
ran
across
the
platform
at
the
last
moment
smith
sank
back
into
the
carriage
stilled
by
perplexity
the
man
was
like
knight
astonishingly
like
him
was
it
possible
it
could
be
he
to
have
got
there
he
must
have
driven
like
the
wind
to
bede
s
inn
and
hardly
have
alighted
before
starting
again
no
it
could
not
be
he
that
was
not
his
way
of
doing
things
during
the
early
part
of
the
journey
stephen
smith
s
thoughts
busied
themselves
till
his
brain
seemed
swollen
one
subject
was
concerning
his
own
approaching
actions
he
was
a
day
earlier
than
his
letter
to
his
parents
had
stated
and
his
arrangement
with
them
had
been
that
they
should
meet
him
at
plymouth
a
plan
which
pleased
the
worthy
couple
beyond
expression
once
before
the
same
engagement
had
been
made
which
he
had
then
quashed
by
his
arrival
this
time
he
would
go
right
on
to
castle
boterel
ramble
in
that
neighbourhood
during
the
evening
and
next
morning
making
inquiries
and
return
to
plymouth
to
meet
them
as
arranged
a
contrivance
which
would
leave
their
cherished
project
undisturbed
relieving
his
own
impatience
also
at
chippenham
there
was
a
little
waiting
and
some
loosening
and
attaching
of
carriages
stephen
looked
out
at
the
same
moment
another
man
s
head
emerged
from
the
adjoining
window
each
looked
in
the
other
s
face
knight
and
stephen
confronted
one
another
you
here
said
the
younger
man
yes
it
seems
that
you
are
too
said
knight
strangely
the
selfishness
of
love
and
the
cruelty
of
jealousy
were
fairly
exemplified
at
this
moment
each
of
the
two
men
looked
at
his
friend
as
he
had
never
looked
at
him
before
each
was
troubled
at
the
other
s
presence
i
thought
you
said
you
were
not
coming
till
remarked
knight
i
did
it
was
an
afterthought
to
come
this
journey
was
your
engagement
then
no
it
was
not
this
is
an
afterthought
of
mine
too
i
left
a
note
to
explain
it
and
account
for
my
not
being
able
to
meet
you
this
evening
as
we
so
did
i
for
you
don
t
look
well
you
did
not
this
i
have
a
headache
you
are
paler
than
you
i
too
have
been
suffering
from
headache
we
have
to
wait
here
a
few
minutes
i
they
walked
up
and
down
the
platform
each
one
more
and
more
embarrassingly
concerned
with
the
awkwardness
of
his
friend
s
presence
they
reached
the
end
of
the
footway
and
paused
in
sheer
stephen
s
vacant
eyes
rested
upon
the
operations
of
some
porters
who
were
shifting
a
dark
and
van
from
the
rear
of
the
train
to
shunt
another
which
was
between
it
and
the
fore
part
of
the
train
this
operation
having
been
concluded
the
two
friends
returned
to
the
side
of
their
carriage
will
you
come
in
here
said
knight
not
very
warmly
i
have
my
rug
and
portmanteau
and
umbrella
with
me
it
is
rather
bothering
to
move
now
said
stephen
reluctantly
why
not
you
come
here
i
have
my
traps
too
it
is
hardly
worth
while
to
shift
them
for
i
shall
see
you
again
you
oh
and
each
got
into
his
own
place
just
at
starting
a
man
on
the
platform
held
up
his
hands
and
stopped
the
train
stephen
looked
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
one
of
the
officials
was
exclaiming
to
another
that
carriage
should
have
been
attached
again
can
t
you
see
it
is
for
the
main
line
quick
what
fools
there
are
in
the
world
what
a
confounded
nuisance
these
stoppages
are
exclaimed
knight
impatiently
looking
out
from
his
compartment
what
is
it
that
singular
carriage
we
saw
has
been
unfastened
from
our
train
by
mistake
it
seems
said
stephen
he
was
watching
the
process
of
attaching
it
the
van
or
carriage
which
he
now
recognized
as
having
seen
at
paddington
before
they
started
was
rich
and
solemn
rather
than
gloomy
in
aspect
it
seemed
to
be
quite
new
and
of
modern
design
and
its
impressive
personality
attracted
the
notice
of
others
beside
himself
he
beheld
it
gradually
wheeled
forward
by
two
men
on
each
side
slower
and
more
sadly
it
seemed
to
approach
then
a
slight
concussion
and
they
were
connected
with
it
and
off
again
stephen
sat
all
the
afternoon
pondering
upon
the
reason
of
knight
s
unexpected
reappearance
was
he
going
as
far
as
castle
boterel
if
so
he
could
only
have
one
object
in
view
a
visit
to
elfride
and
what
an
idea
it
seemed
at
plymouth
smith
partook
of
a
little
refreshment
and
then
went
round
to
the
side
from
which
the
train
started
for
camelton
the
new
station
near
castle
boterel
and
endelstow
knight
was
already
there
stephen
walked
up
and
stood
beside
him
without
speaking
two
men
at
this
moment
crept
out
from
among
the
wheels
of
the
waiting
train
the
carriage
is
light
enough
said
one
in
a
grim
tone
light
as
vanity
full
of
nothing
in
size
but
a
good
deal
in
signification
said
the
other
a
man
of
brighter
mind
and
manners
smith
then
perceived
that
to
their
train
was
attached
that
same
carriage
of
grand
and
dark
aspect
which
had
haunted
them
all
the
way
from
london
you
are
going
on
i
suppose
said
knight
turning
to
stephen
after
idly
looking
at
the
same
object
we
may
as
well
travel
together
for
the
remaining
distance
may
we
not
certainly
we
will
and
they
both
entered
the
same
door
evening
drew
on
apace
it
chanced
to
be
the
eve
of
valentine
s
that
bishop
of
blessed
memory
to
youthful
lovers
and
the
sun
shone
low
under
the
rim
of
a
thick
hard
cloud
decorating
the
eminences
of
the
landscape
with
crowns
of
orange
fire
as
the
train
changed
its
direction
on
a
curve
the
same
rays
stretched
in
through
the
window
and
coaxed
open
knight
s
eyes
you
will
get
out
at
launce
s
i
suppose
he
murmured
no
said
stephen
i
am
not
expected
till
knight
was
silent
and
you
are
you
going
to
endelstow
said
the
younger
man
pointedly
since
you
ask
i
can
do
no
less
than
say
i
am
stephen
continued
knight
slowly
and
with
more
resolution
of
manner
than
he
had
shown
all
the
day
i
am
going
to
endelstow
to
see
if
elfride
swancourt
is
still
free
and
if
so
to
ask
her
to
be
my
so
am
i
said
stephen
smith
i
think
you
ll
lose
your
labour
knight
returned
with
decision
naturally
you
there
was
a
strong
accent
of
bitterness
in
stephen
s
voice
you
might
have
said
hope
instead
of
think
he
added
i
might
have
done
no
such
thing
i
gave
you
my
opinion
elfride
swancourt
may
have
loved
you
once
no
doubt
but
it
was
when
she
was
so
young
that
she
hardly
knew
her
own
thank
you
said
stephen
laconically
she
knew
her
mind
as
well
as
i
did
we
are
the
same
age
if
you
hadn
t
interfered
don
t
say
that
don
t
say
it
stephen
how
can
you
make
out
that
i
interfered
be
just
please
well
said
his
friend
she
was
mine
before
she
was
yours
you
know
that
and
it
seemed
a
hard
thing
to
find
you
had
got
her
and
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
all
might
have
turned
out
well
for
stephen
spoke
with
a
swelling
heart
and
looked
out
of
the
window
to
hide
the
emotion
that
would
make
itself
visible
upon
his
face
it
is
absurd
said
knight
in
a
kinder
tone
for
you
to
look
at
the
matter
in
that
light
what
i
tell
you
is
for
your
good
you
naturally
do
not
like
to
realize
the
truth
that
her
liking
for
you
was
only
a
girl
s
first
fancy
which
has
no
root
it
is
not
true
said
stephen
passionately
it
was
you
put
me
out
and
now
you
ll
be
pushing
in
again
between
us
and
depriving
me
of
my
chance
again
my
right
that
s
what
it
is
how
ungenerous
of
you
to
come
anew
and
try
to
take
her
away
from
me
when
you
had
won
her
i
did
not
interfere
and
you
might
i
think
knight
do
by
me
as
i
did
by
you
don
t
me
you
are
as
well
in
the
world
as
i
am
first
love
is
deepest
and
that
was
who
told
you
that
said
knight
superciliously
i
had
her
first
love
and
it
was
through
me
that
you
and
she
parted
i
can
guess
that
well
it
was
and
if
i
were
to
explain
to
you
in
what
way
that
operated
in
parting
us
i
should
convince
you
that
you
do
quite
wrong
in
intruding
upon
her
that
as
i
said
at
first
your
labour
will
be
lost
i
don
t
choose
to
explain
because
the
particulars
are
painful
but
if
you
won
t
listen
to
me
go
on
for
heaven
s
sake
i
don
t
care
what
you
do
my
you
have
no
right
to
domineer
over
me
as
you
do
just
because
when
i
was
a
lad
i
was
accustomed
to
look
up
to
you
as
a
master
and
you
helped
me
a
little
for
which
i
was
grateful
to
you
and
have
loved
you
you
assume
too
much
now
and
step
in
before
me
it
is
cruel
it
is
unjust
of
you
to
injure
me
so
knight
showed
himself
keenly
hurt
at
this
stephen
those
words
are
untrue
and
unworthy
of
any
man
and
they
are
unworthy
of
you
you
know
you
wrong
me
if
you
have
ever
profited
by
any
instruction
of
mine
i
am
only
too
glad
to
know
it
you
know
it
was
given
ungrudgingly
and
that
i
have
never
once
looked
upon
it
as
making
you
in
any
way
a
debtor
to
stephen
s
naturally
gentle
nature
was
touched
and
it
was
in
a
troubled
voice
that
he
said
yes
yes
i
am
unjust
in
that
i
own
this
is
launce
s
station
i
think
are
you
going
to
get
out
knight
s
manner
of
returning
to
the
matter
in
hand
drew
stephen
again
into
himself
no
i
told
you
i
was
going
to
endelstow
he
resolutely
replied
knight
s
features
became
impassive
and
he
said
no
more
the
train
continued
rattling
on
and
stephen
leant
back
in
his
corner
and
closed
his
eyes
the
yellows
of
evening
had
turned
to
browns
the
dusky
shades
thickened
and
a
flying
cloud
of
dust
occasionally
stroked
the
window
borne
upon
a
chilling
breeze
which
blew
from
the
the
previously
gilded
but
now
dreary
hills
began
to
lose
their
daylight
aspects
of
rotundity
and
to
become
black
discs
vandyked
against
the
sky
all
nature
wearing
the
cloak
that
six
o
clock
casts
over
the
landscape
at
this
time
of
the
year
stephen
started
up
in
bewilderment
after
a
long
stillness
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
recollected
himself
well
how
real
how
real
he
exclaimed
brushing
his
hand
across
his
eyes
what
is
said
knight
that
dream
i
fell
asleep
for
a
few
minutes
and
have
had
a
dream
the
most
vivid
i
ever
he
wearily
looked
out
into
the
gloom
they
were
now
drawing
near
to
camelton
the
lighting
of
the
lamps
was
perceptible
through
the
veil
of
evening
each
flame
starting
into
existence
at
intervals
and
blinking
weakly
against
the
gusts
of
wind
what
did
you
dream
said
knight
moodily
oh
nothing
to
be
told
twas
a
sort
of
incubus
there
is
never
anything
in
i
hardly
supposed
there
i
know
that
however
what
i
so
vividly
dreamt
was
this
since
you
would
like
to
hear
it
was
the
brightest
of
bright
mornings
at
east
endelstow
church
and
you
and
i
stood
by
the
font
far
away
in
the
chancel
lord
luxellian
was
standing
alone
cold
and
impassive
and
utterly
unlike
his
usual
self
but
i
knew
it
was
he
inside
the
altar
rail
stood
a
strange
clergyman
with
his
book
open
he
looked
up
and
said
to
lord
luxellian
where
s
the
bride
lord
luxellian
said
there
s
no
at
that
moment
somebody
came
in
at
the
door
and
i
knew
her
to
be
lady
luxellian
who
died
he
turned
and
said
to
her
i
thought
you
were
in
the
vault
below
us
but
that
could
have
only
been
a
dream
of
mine
come
then
she
came
on
and
in
brushing
between
us
she
chilled
me
so
with
cold
that
i
exclaimed
the
life
is
gone
out
of
me
and
in
the
way
of
dreams
i
awoke
but
here
we
are
at
they
were
slowly
entering
the
station
what
are
you
going
to
do
said
knight
do
you
really
intend
to
call
on
the
swancourts
by
no
means
i
am
going
to
make
inquiries
first
i
shall
stay
at
the
luxellian
arms
you
will
go
right
on
to
endelstow
i
suppose
at
once
i
can
hardly
do
that
at
this
time
of
the
day
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
the
family
her
father
at
any
rate
is
at
variance
with
me
as
much
as
with
you
i
didn
t
know
and
that
i
can
not
rush
into
the
house
as
an
old
friend
any
more
than
you
can
certainly
i
have
the
privileges
of
a
distant
relationship
whatever
they
may
knight
let
down
the
window
and
looked
ahead
there
are
a
great
many
people
at
the
station
he
said
they
seem
all
to
be
on
the
for
when
the
train
stopped
the
friends
could
perceive
by
the
lamplight
that
the
assemblage
of
idlers
enclosed
as
a
kernel
a
group
of
men
in
black
cloaks
a
side
gate
in
the
platform
railing
was
open
and
outside
this
stood
a
dark
vehicle
which
they
could
not
at
first
characterize
then
knight
saw
on
its
upper
part
forms
against
the
sky
like
cedars
by
night
and
knew
the
vehicle
to
be
a
hearse
few
people
were
at
the
carriage
doors
to
meet
the
passengers
the
majority
had
congregated
at
this
upper
end
knight
and
stephen
alighted
and
turned
for
a
moment
in
the
same
direction
the
sombre
van
which
had
accompanied
them
all
day
from
london
now
began
to
reveal
that
their
destination
was
also
its
own
it
had
been
drawn
up
exactly
opposite
the
open
gate
the
bystanders
all
fell
back
forming
a
clear
lane
from
the
gateway
to
the
van
and
the
men
in
cloaks
entered
the
latter
conveyance
they
are
labourers
i
fancy
said
stephen
ah
it
is
strange
but
i
recognize
three
of
them
as
endelstow
men
rather
remarkable
presently
they
began
to
come
out
two
and
two
and
under
the
rays
of
the
lamp
they
were
seen
to
bear
between
them
a
coffin
of
brightly
polished
and
without
a
nail
the
eight
men
took
the
burden
upon
their
shoulders
and
slowly
crossed
with
it
over
to
the
gate
knight
and
stephen
went
outside
and
came
close
to
the
procession
as
it
moved
off
a
carriage
belonging
to
the
cortege
turned
round
close
to
a
lamp
the
rays
shone
in
upon
the
face
of
the
vicar
of
endelstow
swancourt
looking
many
years
older
than
when
they
had
last
seen
him
knight
and
stephen
involuntarily
drew
back
knight
spoke
to
a
bystander
what
has
swancourt
to
do
with
that
funeral
he
is
the
lady
s
father
said
the
bystander
what
lady
s
father
said
knight
in
a
voice
so
hollow
that
the
man
stared
at
him
the
father
of
the
lady
in
the
coffin
she
died
in
london
you
know
and
has
been
brought
here
by
this
train
she
is
to
be
taken
home
and
buried
knight
stood
staring
blindly
at
where
the
hearse
had
been
as
if
he
saw
it
or
some
one
there
then
he
turned
and
beheld
the
lithe
form
of
stephen
bowed
down
like
that
of
an
old
man
he
took
his
young
friend
s
arm
and
led
him
away
from
the
light
chapter
xl
welcome
proud
half
an
hour
has
passed
two
miserable
men
are
wandering
in
the
darkness
up
the
miles
of
road
from
camelton
to
endelstow
has
she
broken
her
heart
said
henry
knight
can
it
be
that
i
have
killed
her
i
was
bitter
with
her
stephen
and
she
has
died
and
may
god
have
no
mercy
upon
me
how
can
you
have
killed
her
more
than
i
why
i
went
away
from
her
stole
away
almost
and
didn
t
tell
her
i
should
not
come
again
and
at
that
last
meeting
i
did
not
kiss
her
once
but
let
her
miserably
go
i
have
been
a
fool
a
fool
i
wish
the
most
abject
confession
of
it
before
crowds
of
my
countrymen
could
in
any
way
make
amends
to
my
darling
for
the
intense
cruelty
i
have
shown
her
your
darling
said
stephen
with
a
sort
of
laugh
any
man
can
say
that
i
suppose
any
man
can
i
know
this
she
was
my
darling
before
she
was
yours
and
after
too
if
anybody
has
a
right
to
call
her
his
own
it
is
you
talk
like
a
man
in
the
dark
which
is
what
you
are
did
she
ever
do
anything
for
you
risk
her
name
for
instance
for
you
yes
she
did
said
stephen
emphatically
not
entirely
did
she
ever
live
for
you
prove
she
could
not
live
without
you
laugh
and
weep
for
you
never
did
she
ever
risk
her
life
for
you
no
my
darling
did
for
then
it
was
in
kindness
only
when
did
she
risk
her
life
for
you
to
save
mine
on
the
cliff
yonder
the
poor
child
was
with
me
looking
at
the
approach
of
the
puffin
steamboat
and
i
slipped
down
we
both
had
a
narrow
escape
i
wish
we
had
died
there
ah
but
wait
stephen
pleaded
with
wet
eyes
she
went
on
that
cliff
to
see
me
arrive
home
she
had
promised
it
she
told
me
she
would
months
before
and
would
she
have
gone
there
if
she
had
not
cared
for
me
at
all
you
have
an
idea
that
elfride
died
for
you
no
doubt
said
knight
with
a
mournful
sarcasm
too
nerveless
to
support
itself
never
mind
if
we
find
that
that
she
died
yours
i
ll
say
no
more
and
if
we
find
she
died
yours
i
ll
say
no
very
well
so
it
shall
the
dark
clouds
into
which
the
sun
had
sunk
had
begun
to
drop
rain
in
an
increasing
volume
can
we
wait
somewhere
here
till
this
shower
is
over
said
stephen
desultorily
as
you
will
but
it
is
not
worth
while
we
ll
hear
the
particulars
and
return
don
t
let
people
know
who
we
are
i
am
not
much
they
had
reached
a
point
at
which
the
road
branched
into
two
just
outside
the
west
village
one
fork
of
the
diverging
routes
passing
into
the
latter
place
the
other
stretching
on
to
east
endelstow
having
come
some
of
the
distance
by
the
footpath
they
now
found
that
the
hearse
was
only
a
little
in
advance
of
them
i
fancy
it
has
turned
off
to
east
endelstow
can
you
see
i
can
not
you
must
be
knight
and
stephen
entered
the
village
a
bar
of
fiery
light
lay
across
the
road
proceeding
from
the
door
of
a
smithy
in
which
bellows
were
heard
blowing
and
a
hammer
ringing
the
rain
had
increased
and
they
mechanically
turned
for
shelter
towards
the
warm
and
cosy
scene
close
at
their
heels
came
another
man
without
or
umbrella
and
with
a
parcel
under
his
arm
a
wet
evening
he
said
to
the
two
friends
and
passed
by
them
they
stood
in
the
outer
penthouse
but
the
man
went
in
to
the
fire
the
smith
ceased
his
blowing
and
began
talking
to
the
man
who
had
entered
i
have
walked
all
the
way
from
camelton
said
the
latter
was
obliged
to
come
you
he
held
the
parcel
which
was
a
flat
one
towards
the
firelight
to
learn
if
the
rain
had
penetrated
it
resting
it
edgewise
on
the
forge
he
supported
it
perpendicularly
with
one
hand
wiping
his
face
with
the
handkerchief
he
held
in
the
other
i
suppose
you
know
what
i
ve
got
here
he
observed
to
the
smith
no
i
don
t
said
the
smith
pausing
again
on
his
bellows
as
the
rain
s
not
over
i
ll
show
you
said
the
bearer
he
laid
the
thin
and
broad
package
which
had
acute
angles
in
different
directions
flat
upon
the
anvil
and
the
smith
blew
up
the
fire
to
give
him
more
light
first
after
untying
the
package
a
sheet
of
brown
paper
was
removed
this
was
laid
flat
then
he
unfolded
a
piece
of
baize
this
also
he
spread
flat
on
the
paper
the
third
covering
was
a
wrapper
of
tissue
paper
which
was
spread
out
in
its
turn
the
enclosure
was
revealed
and
he
held
it
up
for
the
smith
s
inspection
oh
i
see
said
the
smith
kindling
with
a
chastened
interest
and
drawing
close
poor
young
lady
ah
terrible
melancholy
thing
so
soon
too
knight
and
stephen
turned
their
heads
and
looked
and
what
s
that
continued
the
smith
that
s
the
coronet
beautifully
finished
isn
t
it
ah
that
cost
some
money
tis
as
fine
a
bit
of
metal
work
as
ever
i
see
that
it
came
from
the
same
people
as
the
coffin
you
know
but
was
not
ready
soon
enough
to
be
sent
round
to
the
house
in
london
yesterday
i
ve
got
to
fix
it
on
this
very
the
articles
were
a
and
coronet
knight
and
stephen
came
forward
the
undertaker
s
man
on
seeing
them
look
for
the
inscription
civilly
turned
it
round
towards
them
and
each
read
almost
at
one
moment
by
the
ruddy
light
of
the
coals
e
l
f
r
i
d
e
wife
of
spenser
hugo
luxellian
fifteenth
baron
luxellian
died
february
they
read
it
and
read
it
and
read
it
again
stephen
and
knight
as
if
animated
by
one
soul
then
stephen
put
his
hand
upon
knight
s
arm
and
they
retired
from
the
yellow
glow
further
further
till
the
chill
darkness
enclosed
them
round
and
the
quiet
sky
asserted
its
presence
overhead
as
a
dim
grey
sheet
of
blank
monotony
where
shall
we
go
said
stephen
i
don
t
a
long
silence
ensued
elfride
married
said
stephen
then
in
a
thin
whisper
as
if
he
feared
to
let
the
assertion
loose
on
the
world
false
whispered
knight
and
dead
denied
us
both
i
hate
false
i
hate
it
knight
made
no
answer
nothing
was
heard
by
them
now
save
the
slow
measurement
of
time
by
their
beating
pulses
the
soft
touch
of
the
dribbling
rain
upon
their
clothes
and
the
low
purr
of
the
blacksmith
s
bellows
hard
by
shall
we
follow
elfie
any
further
stephen
said
no
let
us
leave
her
alone
she
is
beyond
our
love
and
let
her
be
beyond
our
reproach
since
we
don
t
know
half
the
reasons
that
made
her
do
as
she
did
stephen
how
can
we
say
even
now
that
she
was
not
pure
and
true
in
heart
knight
s
voice
had
now
become
mild
and
gentle
as
a
child
s
he
went
on
can
we
call
her
ambitious
no
circumstance
has
as
usual
overpowered
her
purposes
fragile
and
delicate
as
she
liable
to
be
overthrown
in
a
moment
by
the
coarse
elements
of
accident
i
know
that
s
it
don
t
you
it
may
be
it
must
be
let
us
go
they
began
to
bend
their
steps
towards
castle
boterel
whither
they
had
sent
their
bags
from
camelton
they
wandered
on
in
silence
for
many
minutes
stephen
then
paused
and
lightly
put
his
hand
within
knight
s
arm
i
wonder
how
she
came
to
die
he
said
in
a
broken
whisper
shall
we
return
and
learn
a
little
more
they
turned
back
again
and
entering
endelstow
a
second
time
came
to
a
door
which
was
standing
open
it
was
that
of
an
inn
called
the
welcome
home
and
the
house
appeared
to
have
been
recently
repaired
and
entirely
modernized
the
name
too
was
not
that
of
the
same
landlord
as
formerly
but
martin
cannister
s
knight
and
smith
entered
the
inn
was
quite
silent
and
they
followed
the
passage
till
they
reached
the
kitchen
where
a
huge
fire
was
burning
which
roared
up
the
chimney
and
sent
over
the
floor
ceiling
and
walls
a
glare
so
intense
as
to
make
the
candle
quite
a
secondary
light
a
woman
in
a
white
apron
and
black
gown
was
standing
there
alone
behind
a
deal
table
stephen
first
and
knight
afterwards
recognized
her
as
unity
who
had
been
at
the
vicarage
and
young
lady
at
the
crags
unity
said
stephen
softly
don
t
you
know
me
she
looked
inquiringly
a
moment
and
her
face
cleared
up
mr
smith
ay
that
it
is
she
said
and
that
s
knight
i
beg
you
to
sit
down
perhaps
you
know
that
since
i
saw
you
last
i
have
married
martin
how
long
have
you
been
married
about
five
months
we
were
married
the
same
day
that
my
dear
miss
elfie
became
lady
tears
appeared
in
unity
s
eyes
and
filled
them
and
fell
down
her
cheek
in
spite
of
efforts
to
the
contrary
the
pain
of
the
two
men
in
resolutely
controlling
themselves
when
thus
exampled
to
admit
relief
of
the
same
kind
was
distressing
they
both
turned
their
backs
and
walked
a
few
steps
away
then
unity
said
will
you
go
into
the
parlour
gentlemen
let
us
stay
here
with
her
knight
whispered
and
turning
said
no
we
will
sit
here
we
want
to
rest
and
dry
ourselves
here
for
a
time
if
you
that
evening
the
sorrowing
friends
sat
with
their
hostess
beside
the
large
fire
knight
in
the
recess
formed
by
the
chimney
breast
where
he
was
in
shade
and
by
showing
a
little
confidence
they
won
hers
and
she
told
them
what
they
had
stayed
to
hear
the
latter
history
of
poor
elfride
one
day
after
you
knight
left
us
for
the
last
time
she
was
missed
from
the
crags
and
her
father
went
after
her
and
brought
her
home
where
she
went
to
i
never
knew
but
she
was
very
unwell
for
weeks
afterwards
and
she
said
to
me
that
she
didn
t
care
what
became
of
her
and
she
wished
she
could
die
when
she
was
better
i
said
she
would
live
to
be
married
yet
and
she
said
then
yes
i
ll
do
anything
for
the
benefit
of
my
family
so
as
to
turn
my
useless
life
to
some
practical
well
it
began
like
this
about
lord
luxellian
courting
her
the
first
lady
luxellian
had
died
and
he
was
in
great
trouble
because
the
little
girls
were
left
motherless
after
a
while
they
used
to
come
and
see
her
in
their
little
black
frocks
for
they
liked
her
as
well
or
better
than
their
own
mother
s
true
they
used
to
call
her
little
these
children
made
her
a
shade
livelier
but
she
was
not
the
girl
she
had
been
i
could
see
that
and
she
grew
thinner
a
good
deal
well
my
lord
got
to
ask
the
swancourts
oftener
and
oftener
to
dinner
nobody
else
of
his
acquaintance
and
at
last
the
vicar
s
family
were
backwards
and
forwards
at
all
hours
of
the
day
well
people
say
that
the
little
girls
asked
their
father
to
let
miss
elfride
come
and
live
with
them
and
that
he
said
perhaps
he
would
if
they
were
good
children
however
the
time
went
on
and
one
day
i
said
miss
elfride
you
don
t
look
so
well
as
you
used
to
and
though
nobody
else
seems
to
notice
it
i
she
laughed
a
little
and
said
i
shall
live
to
be
married
yet
as
you
told
shall
you
miss
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
i
said
whom
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
be
married
to
she
said
again
mr
knight
i
suppose
said
i
oh
she
cried
and
turned
off
so
white
and
afore
i
could
get
to
her
she
had
sunk
down
like
a
heap
of
clothes
and
fainted
away
well
then
she
came
to
herself
after
a
time
and
said
unity
now
we
ll
go
on
with
our
better
not
miss
i
said
yes
we
will
she
said
whom
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
be
married
to
i
don
t
know
i
said
this
time
guess
she
said
tisn
t
my
lord
is
it
says
i
yes
tis
says
she
in
a
sick
wild
way
but
he
don
t
come
courting
much
i
said
ah
you
don
t
know
she
said
and
told
me
twas
going
to
be
in
october
after
that
she
freshened
up
a
bit
whether
twas
with
the
thought
of
getting
away
from
home
or
not
i
don
t
know
for
perhaps
i
may
as
well
speak
plainly
and
tell
you
that
her
home
was
no
home
to
her
now
her
father
was
bitter
to
her
and
harsh
upon
her
and
though
swancourt
was
well
enough
in
her
way
twas
a
sort
of
cold
politeness
that
was
not
worth
much
and
the
little
thing
had
a
worrying
time
of
it
altogether
about
a
month
before
the
wedding
she
and
my
lord
and
the
two
children
used
to
ride
about
together
upon
horseback
and
a
very
pretty
sight
they
were
and
if
you
ll
believe
me
i
never
saw
him
once
with
her
unless
the
children
were
with
her
too
which
made
the
courting
so
ay
and
my
lord
is
so
handsome
you
know
so
that
at
last
i
think
she
rather
liked
him
and
i
have
seen
her
smile
and
blush
a
bit
at
things
he
said
he
wanted
her
the
more
because
the
children
did
for
everybody
could
see
that
she
would
be
a
most
tender
mother
to
them
and
friend
and
playmate
too
and
my
lord
is
not
only
handsome
but
a
splendid
courter
and
up
to
all
the
ways
o
t
so
he
made
her
the
beautifullest
presents
ah
one
i
can
mind
a
lovely
bracelet
with
diamonds
and
emeralds
oh
how
red
her
face
came
when
she
saw
it
the
old
roses
came
back
to
her
cheeks
for
a
minute
or
two
then
i
helped
dress
her
the
day
we
both
were
married
it
was
the
last
service
i
did
her
poor
child
when
she
was
ready
i
ran
upstairs
and
slipped
on
my
own
wedding
gown
and
away
they
went
and
away
went
martin
and
i
and
no
sooner
had
my
lord
and
my
lady
been
married
than
the
parson
married
us
it
was
a
very
quiet
pair
of
weddings
hardly
anybody
knew
it
well
hope
will
hold
its
own
in
a
young
heart
if
so
be
it
can
and
my
lady
freshened
up
a
bit
for
my
lord
was
so
handsome
and
how
came
she
to
die
and
away
from
home
murmured
knight
don
t
you
see
sir
she
fell
off
again
afore
they
d
been
married
long
and
my
lord
took
her
abroad
for
change
of
scene
they
were
coming
home
and
had
got
as
far
as
london
when
she
was
taken
very
ill
and
couldn
t
be
moved
and
there
she
was
he
very
fond
of
her
what
my
lord
oh
he
was
very
fond
of
her
very
beyond
everything
not
suddenly
but
by
slow
degrees
twas
her
nature
to
win
people
more
when
they
knew
her
well
he
d
have
died
for
her
i
believe
poor
my
lord
he
s
now
the
funeral
is
yes
my
husband
is
now
at
the
vault
with
the
masons
opening
the
steps
and
cleaning
down
the
the
next
day
two
men
walked
up
the
familiar
valley
from
castle
boterel
to
east
endelstow
church
and
when
the
funeral
was
over
and
every
one
had
left
the
churchyard
the
pair
went
softly
down
the
steps
of
the
luxellian
vault
and
under
the
arches
they
had
beheld
once
before
lit
up
then
as
now
in
the
new
niche
of
the
crypt
lay
a
rather
new
coffin
which
had
lost
some
of
its
lustre
and
a
newer
coffin
still
bright
and
untarnished
in
the
slightest
degree
beside
the
latter
was
the
dark
form
of
a
man
kneeling
on
the
damp
floor
his
body
flung
across
the
coffin
his
hands
clasped
and
his
whole
frame
seemingly
given
up
in
utter
abandonment
to
grief
he
was
still
young
younger
perhaps
than
knight
and
even
now
showed
how
graceful
was
his
figure
and
symmetrical
his
build
he
murmured
a
prayer
half
aloud
and
was
quite
unconscious
that
two
others
were
standing
within
a
few
yards
of
him
knight
and
stephen
had
advanced
to
where
they
once
stood
beside
elfride
on
the
day
all
three
had
met
there
before
she
had
herself
gone
down
into
silence
like
her
ancestors
and
shut
her
bright
blue
eyes
for
ever
not
until
then
did
they
see
the
kneeling
figure
in
the
dim
light
knight
instantly
recognized
the
mourner
as
lord
luxellian
the
bereaved
husband
of
elfride
they
felt
themselves
to
be
intruders
knight
pressed
stephen
back
and
they
silently
withdrew
as
they
had
entered
come
away
he
said
in
a
broken
voice
we
have
no
right
to
be
there
another
stands
before
us
nearer
to
her
than
we
and
side
by
side
they
both
retraced
their
steps
down
the
grey
still
valley
to
castle
boterel
