on
the
eighth
day
of
last
december
mon
gerbois
professor
of
mathematics
at
the
college
of
versailles
while
rummaging
in
an
old
unearthed
a
small
mahogany
which
pleased
him
very
much
on
account
of
the
multiplicity
of
its
drawers
just
the
thing
for
suzanne
birthday
present
thought
he
and
as
he
always
tried
to
furnish
some
simple
pleasures
for
his
daughter
consistent
with
his
modest
income
he
enquired
the
price
and
after
some
keen
bargaining
purchased
it
for
francs
as
he
was
giving
his
address
to
the
shopkeeper
a
young
man
dressed
with
elegance
and
taste
who
had
been
exploring
the
stock
of
antiques
caught
sight
of
the
and
immediately
enquired
its
price
it
is
sold
replied
the
shopkeeper
ah
to
this
gentleman
i
presume
monsieur
gerbois
bowed
and
left
the
store
quite
proud
to
be
the
possessor
of
an
article
which
had
attracted
the
attention
of
a
gentleman
of
quality
but
he
had
not
taken
a
dozen
steps
in
the
street
when
he
was
overtaken
by
the
young
man
who
hat
in
hand
and
in
a
tone
of
perfect
courtesy
thus
addressed
him
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question
that
you
may
deem
impertinent
it
is
this
did
you
have
any
special
object
in
view
when
you
bought
that
no
i
came
across
it
by
chance
and
it
struck
my
fancy
but
you
do
not
care
for
it
particularly
oh
i
shall
keep
it
that
is
all
because
it
is
an
antique
perhaps
no
because
it
is
convenient
declared
mon
gerbois
in
that
case
you
would
consent
to
exchange
it
for
another
desk
that
would
be
quite
as
convenient
and
in
better
condition
oh
this
one
is
in
good
condition
and
i
see
no
object
in
making
an
exchange
but
mon
gerbois
is
a
man
of
irritable
disposition
and
hasty
temper
so
he
replied
testily
i
beg
of
you
monsieur
do
not
insist
but
the
young
man
firmly
held
his
ground
i
do
know
how
much
you
paid
for
it
monsieur
but
i
offer
you
double
no
three
times
the
amount
oh
that
will
do
exclaimed
the
professor
impatiently
i
do
wish
to
sell
it
the
young
man
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
in
a
manner
that
mon
gerbois
would
not
readily
forget
then
turned
and
walked
rapidly
away
an
hour
later
the
desk
was
delivered
at
the
professor
house
on
the
viroflay
road
he
called
his
daughter
and
said
here
is
something
for
you
suzanne
provided
you
like
it
suzanne
was
a
pretty
girl
with
a
gay
and
affectionate
nature
she
threw
her
arms
around
her
father
neck
and
kissed
him
rapturously
to
her
the
desk
had
all
the
semblance
of
a
royal
gift
that
evening
assisted
by
hortense
the
servant
she
placed
the
desk
in
her
room
then
she
dusted
it
cleaned
the
drawers
and
and
carefully
arranged
within
it
her
papers
writing
material
correspondence
a
collection
of
and
some
souvenirs
of
her
cousin
philippe
that
she
kept
in
secret
next
morning
at
half
past
seven
mon
gerbois
went
to
the
college
at
ten
in
pursuance
of
her
usual
custom
suzanne
went
to
meet
him
and
it
was
a
great
pleasure
for
him
to
see
her
slender
figure
and
childish
smile
waiting
for
him
at
the
college
gate
they
returned
home
together
and
your
writing
desk
how
is
it
this
morning
marvellous
hortense
and
i
have
polished
the
brass
mountings
until
they
look
like
gold
so
you
are
pleased
with
it
pleased
with
it
why
i
do
see
how
i
managed
to
get
on
without
it
for
such
a
long
time
as
they
were
walking
up
the
pathway
to
the
house
mon
gerbois
said
shall
we
go
and
take
a
look
at
it
before
breakfast
oh
yes
that
a
splendid
idea
she
ascended
the
stairs
ahead
of
her
father
but
on
arriving
at
the
door
of
her
room
she
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
dismay
what
the
matter
stammered
mon
gerbois
the
is
gone
when
the
police
were
called
in
they
were
astonished
at
the
admirable
simplicity
of
the
means
employed
by
the
thief
during
suzanne
absence
the
servant
had
gone
to
market
and
while
the
house
was
thus
left
unguarded
a
drayman
wearing
a
badge
some
of
the
neighbors
saw
it
stopped
his
cart
in
front
of
the
house
and
rang
twice
not
knowing
that
hortense
was
absent
the
neighbors
were
not
suspicious
consequently
the
man
carried
on
his
work
in
peace
and
tranquility
apart
from
the
desk
not
a
thing
in
the
house
had
been
disturbed
even
suzanne
purse
which
she
had
left
upon
the
was
found
upon
an
adjacent
table
with
its
contents
untouched
it
was
obvious
that
the
thief
had
come
with
a
set
purpose
which
rendered
the
crime
even
more
mysterious
because
why
did
he
assume
so
great
a
risk
for
such
a
trifling
object
the
only
clue
the
professor
could
furnish
was
the
strange
incident
of
the
preceding
evening
he
declared
the
young
man
was
greatly
provoked
at
my
refusal
and
i
had
an
idea
that
he
threatened
me
as
he
went
away
but
the
clue
was
a
vague
one
the
shopkeeper
could
not
throw
any
light
on
the
affair
he
did
not
know
either
of
the
gentlemen
as
to
the
desk
itself
he
had
purchased
it
for
forty
francs
at
an
executor
sale
at
chevreuse
and
believed
he
had
resold
it
at
its
fair
value
the
police
investigation
disclosed
nothing
more
but
mon
gerbois
entertained
the
idea
that
he
had
suffered
an
enormous
loss
there
must
have
been
a
fortune
concealed
in
a
secret
drawer
and
that
was
the
reason
the
young
man
had
resorted
to
crime
my
poor
father
what
would
we
have
done
with
that
fortune
asked
suzanne
my
child
with
such
a
fortune
you
could
make
a
most
advantageous
marriage
suzanne
sighed
bitterly
her
aspirations
soared
no
higher
than
her
cousin
philippe
who
was
indeed
a
most
deplorable
object
and
life
in
the
little
house
at
versailles
was
not
so
happy
and
contented
as
of
yore
two
months
passed
away
then
came
a
succession
of
startling
events
a
strange
blending
of
good
luck
and
dire
misfortune
on
the
first
day
of
february
at
five
mon
gerbois
entered
the
house
carrying
an
evening
paper
took
a
seat
put
on
his
spectacles
and
commenced
to
read
as
politics
did
not
interest
him
he
turned
to
the
inside
of
the
paper
immediately
his
attention
was
attracted
by
an
article
entitled
third
drawing
of
the
press
association
lottery
no
series
draws
a
million
the
newspaper
slipped
from
his
fingers
the
walls
swam
before
his
eyes
and
his
heart
ceased
to
beat
he
held
no
series
he
had
purchased
it
from
a
friend
to
oblige
him
without
any
thought
of
success
and
behold
it
was
the
lucky
number
quickly
he
took
out
his
yes
he
was
quite
right
the
no
series
was
written
there
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
but
the
ticket
he
rushed
to
his
desk
to
find
the
in
which
he
had
placed
the
precious
ticket
but
the
box
was
not
there
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
it
had
not
been
there
for
several
weeks
he
heard
footsteps
on
the
gravel
walk
leading
from
the
street
he
called
suzanne
suzanne
she
was
returning
from
a
walk
she
entered
hastily
he
stammered
in
a
choking
voice
suzanne
the
box
the
box
of
envelopes
what
box
the
one
i
bought
at
the
louvre
one
saturday
it
was
at
the
end
of
that
table
do
you
remember
father
we
put
all
those
things
away
together
when
the
evening
you
know
the
same
evening
but
where
tell
me
quick
where
where
why
in
the
in
the
that
was
stolen
yes
oh
mon
dieu
in
the
stolen
desk
he
uttered
the
last
sentence
in
a
low
voice
in
a
sort
of
stupor
then
he
seized
her
hand
and
in
a
still
lower
voice
he
said
it
contained
a
million
my
child
ah
father
why
did
you
tell
me
she
murmured
naively
a
million
he
repeated
it
contained
the
ticket
that
drew
the
grand
prize
in
the
press
lottery
the
colossal
proportions
of
the
disaster
overwhelmed
them
and
for
a
long
time
they
maintained
a
silence
that
they
feared
to
break
at
last
suzanne
said
but
father
they
will
pay
you
just
the
same
how
on
what
proof
must
you
have
proof
of
course
and
you
have
any
it
was
in
the
box
in
the
box
that
has
disappeared
yes
and
now
the
thief
will
get
the
money
oh
that
would
be
terrible
father
you
must
prevent
it
for
a
moment
he
was
silent
then
in
an
outburst
of
energy
he
leaped
up
stamped
on
the
floor
and
exclaimed
no
no
he
shall
not
have
that
million
he
shall
not
have
it
why
should
he
have
it
ah
clever
as
he
is
he
can
do
nothing
if
he
goes
to
claim
the
money
they
will
arrest
him
ah
now
we
will
see
my
fine
fellow
what
will
you
do
father
defend
our
just
rights
whatever
happens
and
we
will
succeed
the
million
francs
belong
to
me
and
i
intend
to
have
them
a
few
minutes
later
he
sent
this
telegram
governor
crédit
foncier
rue
capucines
paris
am
holder
of
no
series
oppose
by
all
legal
means
any
other
claimant
gerbois
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
crédit
foncier
received
the
following
telegram
no
series
is
in
my
possession
arsène
lupin
every
time
i
undertake
to
relate
one
of
the
many
extraordinary
adventures
that
mark
the
life
of
arsène
lupin
i
experience
a
feeling
of
embarrassment
as
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
commonplace
of
those
adventures
is
already
well
known
to
my
readers
in
fact
there
is
not
a
movement
of
our
national
thief
as
he
has
been
so
aptly
described
that
has
not
been
given
the
widest
publicity
not
an
exploit
that
has
not
been
studied
in
all
its
phases
not
an
action
that
has
not
been
discussed
with
that
particularity
usually
reserved
for
the
recital
of
heroic
deeds
for
instance
who
does
not
know
the
strange
history
of
the
blonde
lady
with
those
curious
episodes
which
were
proclaimed
by
the
newspapers
with
heavy
black
headlines
as
follows
lottery
ticket
no
the
crime
on
the
avenue
the
blue
diamond
the
interest
created
by
the
intervention
of
the
celebrated
english
detective
herlock
sholmes
the
excitement
aroused
by
the
various
vicissitudes
which
marked
the
struggle
between
those
famous
artists
and
what
a
commotion
on
the
boulevards
the
day
on
which
the
newsboys
announced
arrest
of
arsène
lupin
my
excuse
for
repeating
these
stories
at
this
time
is
the
fact
that
i
produce
the
key
to
the
enigma
those
adventures
have
always
been
enveloped
in
a
certain
degree
of
obscurity
which
i
now
remove
i
reproduce
old
newspaper
articles
i
relate
interviews
i
present
ancient
letters
but
i
have
arranged
and
classified
all
that
material
and
reduced
it
to
the
exact
truth
my
collaborators
in
this
work
have
been
arsène
lupin
himself
and
also
the
ineffable
wilson
the
friend
and
confidant
of
herlock
sholmes
every
one
will
recall
the
tremendous
burst
of
laughter
which
greeted
the
publication
of
those
two
telegrams
the
name
arsène
lupin
was
in
itself
a
stimulus
to
curiosity
a
promise
of
amusement
for
the
gallery
and
in
this
case
the
gallery
means
the
entire
world
an
investigation
was
immediately
commenced
by
the
crédit
foncier
which
established
these
facts
that
ticket
no
series
had
been
sold
by
the
versailles
branch
office
of
the
lottery
to
an
artillery
officer
named
bessy
who
was
afterward
killed
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
some
time
before
his
death
he
informed
some
of
his
comrades
that
he
had
transferred
his
ticket
to
a
friend
and
i
am
that
friend
affirmed
mon
gerbois
prove
it
replied
the
governor
of
the
crédit
foncier
of
course
i
can
prove
it
twenty
people
can
tell
you
that
i
was
an
intimate
friend
of
monsieur
bessy
and
that
we
frequently
met
at
the
café
de
la
it
was
there
one
day
i
purchased
the
ticket
from
him
for
twenty
francs
simply
as
an
accommodation
to
him
have
you
any
witnesses
to
that
transaction
no
well
how
do
you
expect
to
prove
it
by
a
letter
he
wrote
to
me
what
letter
a
letter
that
was
pinned
to
the
ticket
produce
it
it
was
stolen
at
the
same
time
as
the
ticket
well
you
must
find
it
it
was
soon
learned
that
arsène
lupin
had
the
letter
a
short
paragraph
appeared
in
the
de
which
has
the
honor
to
be
his
official
organ
and
of
which
it
is
said
he
is
one
of
the
principal
shareholders
the
paragraph
announced
that
arsène
lupin
had
placed
in
the
hands
of
monsieur
detinan
his
advocate
and
legal
adviser
the
letter
that
monsieur
bessy
had
written
to
him
to
him
personally
this
announcement
provoked
an
outburst
of
laughter
arsène
lupin
had
engaged
a
lawyer
arsène
lupin
conforming
to
the
rules
and
customs
of
modern
society
had
appointed
a
legal
representative
in
the
person
of
a
member
of
the
parisian
bar
mon
detinan
had
never
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
meeting
arsène
lupin
a
fact
he
deeply
regretted
but
he
had
actually
been
retained
by
that
mysterious
gentleman
and
felt
greatly
honored
by
the
choice
he
was
prepared
to
defend
the
interests
of
his
client
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
was
pleased
even
proud
to
exhibit
the
letter
of
mon
bessy
but
although
it
proved
the
transfer
of
the
ticket
it
did
not
mention
the
name
of
the
purchaser
it
was
simply
addressed
to
my
dear
friend
my
dear
friend
that
is
i
added
arsène
lupin
in
a
note
attached
to
mon
bessy
letter
and
the
best
proof
of
that
fact
is
that
i
hold
the
letter
the
swarm
of
reporters
immediately
rushed
to
see
mon
gerbois
who
could
only
repeat
my
dear
friend
that
is
i
arsène
lupin
stole
the
letter
with
the
lottery
ticket
let
him
prove
it
retorted
lupin
to
the
reporters
he
must
have
done
it
because
he
stole
the
exclaimed
mon
gerbois
before
the
same
reporters
let
him
prove
it
replied
lupin
such
was
the
entertaining
comedy
enacted
by
the
two
claimants
of
ticket
no
and
the
calm
demeanor
of
arsène
lupin
contrasted
strangely
with
the
nervous
perturbation
of
poor
mon
gerbois
the
newspapers
were
filled
with
the
lamentations
of
that
unhappy
man
he
announced
his
misfortune
with
pathetic
candor
understand
gentlemen
it
was
suzanne
dowry
that
the
rascal
stole
personally
i
do
care
a
straw
for
it
but
for
suzanne
just
think
of
it
a
whole
million
ten
times
one
hundred
thousand
francs
ah
i
knew
very
well
that
the
desk
contained
a
treasure
it
was
in
vain
to
tell
him
that
his
adversary
when
stealing
the
desk
was
unaware
that
the
lottery
ticket
was
in
it
and
that
in
any
event
he
could
not
foresee
that
the
ticket
would
draw
the
grand
prize
he
would
reply
nonsense
of
course
he
knew
it
else
why
would
he
take
the
trouble
to
steal
a
poor
miserable
desk
for
some
unknown
reason
but
certainly
not
for
a
small
scrap
of
paper
which
was
then
worth
only
twenty
francs
a
million
francs
he
knew
it
he
knows
everything
ah
you
do
not
know
him
the
scoundrel
he
has
robbed
you
of
a
million
francs
the
controversy
would
have
lasted
for
a
much
longer
time
but
on
the
twelfth
day
mon
gerbois
received
from
arsène
lupin
a
letter
marked
confidential
which
read
as
follows
monsieur
the
gallery
is
being
amused
at
our
expense
do
you
not
think
it
is
time
for
us
to
be
serious
the
situation
is
this
i
possess
a
ticket
to
which
i
have
no
legal
right
and
you
have
the
legal
right
to
a
ticket
you
do
not
possess
neither
of
us
can
do
anything
you
will
not
relinquish
your
rights
to
me
i
will
not
deliver
the
ticket
to
you
now
what
is
to
be
done
i
see
only
one
way
out
of
the
difficulty
let
us
divide
the
spoils
a
for
you
a
for
me
is
not
that
a
fair
division
in
my
opinion
it
is
an
equitable
solution
and
an
immediate
one
i
will
give
you
three
days
time
to
consider
the
proposition
on
thursday
morning
i
shall
expect
to
read
in
the
personal
column
of
the
echo
de
france
a
discreet
message
addressed
to
ars
expressing
in
veiled
terms
your
consent
to
my
offer
by
so
doing
you
will
recover
immediate
possession
of
the
ticket
then
you
can
collect
the
money
and
send
me
half
a
million
in
a
manner
that
i
will
describe
to
you
later
in
case
of
your
refusal
i
shall
resort
to
other
measures
to
accomplish
the
same
result
but
apart
from
the
very
serious
annoyances
that
such
obstinacy
on
your
part
will
cause
you
it
will
cost
you
thousand
francs
for
supplementary
expenses
believe
me
monsieur
i
remain
your
devoted
servant
arsène
lupin
in
a
fit
of
exasperation
mon
gerbois
committed
the
grave
mistake
of
showing
that
letter
and
allowing
a
copy
of
it
to
be
taken
his
indignation
overcame
his
discretion
nothing
he
shall
have
nothing
he
exclaimed
before
a
crowd
of
reporters
to
divide
my
property
with
him
never
let
him
tear
up
the
ticket
if
he
wishes
yet
five
hundred
thousand
francs
is
better
than
nothing
that
is
not
the
question
it
is
a
question
of
my
just
right
and
that
right
i
will
establish
before
the
courts
what
attack
arsène
lupin
that
would
be
amusing
no
but
the
crédit
foncier
they
must
pay
me
the
million
francs
without
producing
the
ticket
or
at
least
without
proving
that
you
bought
it
that
proof
exists
since
arsène
lupin
admits
that
he
stole
the
but
would
the
word
of
arsène
lupin
carry
any
weight
with
the
court
no
matter
i
will
fight
it
out
the
gallery
shouted
with
glee
and
wagers
were
freely
made
upon
the
result
with
the
odds
in
favor
of
lupin
on
the
following
thursday
the
personal
column
in
the
de
was
eagerly
perused
by
the
expectant
public
but
it
contained
nothing
addressed
to
ars
mon
gerbois
had
not
replied
to
arsène
lupin
letter
that
was
the
declaration
of
war
that
evening
the
newspapers
announced
the
abduction
of
mlle
suzanne
gerbois
the
most
entertaining
feature
in
what
might
be
called
the
arsène
lupin
dramas
is
the
comic
attitude
displayed
by
the
parisian
police
arsène
lupin
talks
plans
writes
commands
threatens
and
executes
as
if
the
police
did
not
exist
they
never
figure
in
his
calculations
and
yet
the
police
do
their
utmost
but
what
can
they
do
against
such
a
foe
a
foe
that
scorns
and
ignores
them
suzanne
had
left
the
house
at
twenty
minutes
to
ten
such
was
the
testimony
of
the
servant
on
leaving
the
college
at
five
minutes
past
ten
her
father
did
not
find
her
at
the
place
she
was
accustomed
to
wait
for
him
consequently
whatever
had
happened
must
have
occurred
during
the
course
of
suzanne
walk
from
the
house
to
the
college
two
neighbors
had
met
her
about
three
hundred
yards
from
the
house
a
lady
had
seen
on
the
avenue
a
young
girl
corresponding
to
description
no
one
else
had
seen
her
inquiries
were
made
in
all
directions
the
employees
of
the
railways
and
lines
were
questioned
but
none
of
them
had
seen
anything
of
the
missing
girl
however
at
they
found
a
shopkeeper
who
had
furnished
gasoline
to
an
automobile
that
had
come
from
paris
on
the
day
of
the
abduction
it
was
occupied
by
a
blonde
woman
extremely
blonde
said
the
witness
an
hour
later
the
automobile
again
passed
through
on
its
way
from
versailles
to
paris
the
shopkeeper
declared
that
the
automobile
now
contained
a
second
woman
who
was
heavily
veiled
no
doubt
it
was
suzanne
gerbois
the
abduction
must
have
taken
place
in
broad
daylight
on
a
frequented
street
in
the
very
heart
of
the
town
how
and
at
what
spot
not
a
cry
was
heard
not
a
suspicious
action
had
been
seen
the
shopkeeper
described
the
automobile
as
a
limousine
of
made
by
the
firm
of
peugeon
co
inquiries
were
then
made
at
the
managed
by
madame
who
made
a
specialty
of
abductions
by
automobile
it
was
learned
that
she
had
rented
a
peugeon
limousine
on
that
day
to
a
blonde
woman
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
nor
since
who
was
the
chauffeur
a
young
man
named
ernest
whom
i
had
engaged
only
the
day
before
he
came
well
recommended
is
he
here
now
no
he
brought
back
the
machine
but
i
have
seen
him
since
said
madame
do
you
know
where
we
can
find
him
you
might
see
the
people
who
recommended
him
to
me
here
are
the
names
upon
inquiry
it
was
learned
that
none
of
these
people
knew
the
man
called
ernest
the
recommendations
were
forged
such
was
the
fate
of
every
clue
followed
by
the
police
it
ended
nowhere
the
mystery
remained
unsolved
mon
gerbois
had
not
the
strength
or
courage
to
wage
such
an
unequal
battle
the
disappearance
of
his
daughter
crushed
him
he
capitulated
to
the
enemy
a
short
announcement
in
the
de
proclaimed
his
unconditional
surrender
two
days
later
mon
gerbois
visited
the
office
of
the
crédit
foncier
and
handed
lottery
ticket
number
series
to
the
governor
who
exclaimed
with
surprise
ah
you
have
it
he
has
returned
it
to
you
it
was
mislaid
that
was
all
replied
mon
gerbois
but
you
pretended
that
it
had
been
stolen
at
first
i
thought
it
had
but
here
it
is
we
will
require
some
evidence
to
establish
your
right
to
the
ticket
will
the
letter
of
the
purchaser
monsieur
bessy
be
sufficient
yes
that
will
do
here
it
is
said
mon
gerbois
producing
the
letter
very
well
leave
these
papers
with
us
the
rules
of
the
lottery
allow
us
fifteen
days
time
to
investigate
your
claim
i
will
let
you
know
when
to
call
for
your
money
i
presume
you
desire
as
much
as
i
do
that
this
affair
should
be
closed
without
further
publicity
quite
so
mon
gerbois
and
the
governor
henceforth
maintained
a
discreet
silence
but
the
secret
was
revealed
in
some
way
for
it
was
soon
commonly
known
that
arsène
lupin
had
returned
the
lottery
ticket
to
mon
gerbois
the
public
received
the
news
with
astonishment
and
admiration
certainly
he
was
a
bold
gamester
who
thus
threw
upon
the
table
a
trump
card
of
such
importance
as
the
precious
ticket
but
it
was
true
he
still
retained
a
trump
card
of
equal
importance
however
if
the
young
girl
should
escape
if
the
hostage
held
by
arsène
lupin
should
be
rescued
the
police
thought
they
had
discovered
the
weak
spot
of
the
enemy
and
now
redoubled
their
efforts
arsène
lupin
disarmed
by
his
own
act
crushed
by
the
wheels
of
his
own
machination
deprived
of
every
sou
of
the
coveted
million
public
interest
now
centered
in
the
camp
of
his
adversary
but
it
was
necessary
to
find
suzanne
and
they
did
not
find
her
nor
did
she
escape
consequently
it
must
be
admitted
arsène
lupin
had
won
the
first
hand
but
the
game
was
not
yet
decided
the
most
difficult
point
remained
mlle
gerbois
is
in
his
possession
and
he
will
hold
her
until
he
receives
five
hundred
thousand
francs
but
how
and
where
will
such
an
exchange
be
made
for
that
purpose
a
meeting
must
be
arranged
and
then
what
will
prevent
mon
gerbois
from
warning
the
police
and
in
that
way
effecting
the
rescue
of
his
daughter
and
at
the
same
time
keeping
his
money
the
professor
was
interviewed
but
he
was
extremely
reticent
his
answer
was
i
have
nothing
to
say
and
mlle
gerbois
the
search
is
being
continued
but
arsène
lupin
has
written
to
you
no
do
you
swear
to
that
no
then
it
is
true
what
are
his
instructions
i
have
nothing
to
say
then
the
interviewers
attacked
mon
detinan
and
found
him
equally
discreet
monsieur
lupin
is
my
client
and
i
can
not
discuss
his
affairs
he
replied
with
an
affected
air
of
gravity
these
mysteries
served
to
irritate
the
gallery
obviously
some
secret
negotiations
were
in
progress
arsène
lupin
had
arranged
and
tightened
the
meshes
of
his
net
while
the
police
maintained
a
close
watch
day
and
night
over
mon
gerbois
and
the
three
and
only
possible
dénouements
the
arrest
the
triumph
or
the
ridiculous
and
pitiful
abortion
were
freely
discussed
but
the
curiosity
of
the
public
was
only
partially
satisfied
and
it
was
reserved
for
these
pages
to
reveal
the
exact
truth
of
the
affair
on
monday
march
mon
gerbois
received
a
notice
from
the
crédit
foncier
on
wednesday
he
took
the
one
train
for
paris
at
two
a
thousand
of
one
thousand
francs
each
were
delivered
to
him
whilst
he
was
counting
them
one
by
one
in
a
state
of
nervous
agitation
that
money
which
represented
suzanne
ransom
a
carriage
containing
two
men
stopped
at
the
curb
a
short
distance
from
the
bank
one
of
the
men
had
grey
hair
and
an
unusually
shrewd
expression
which
formed
a
striking
contrast
to
his
shabby
it
was
detective
ganimard
the
relentless
enemy
of
arsène
lupin
ganimard
said
to
his
companion
folenfant
in
five
minutes
we
will
see
our
clever
friend
lupin
is
everything
ready
yes
how
many
men
have
we
eight
two
of
them
on
bicycles
enough
but
not
too
many
on
no
account
must
gerbois
escape
us
if
he
does
it
is
all
up
he
will
meet
lupin
at
the
appointed
place
give
half
a
million
in
exchange
for
the
girl
and
the
game
will
be
over
but
why
does
gerbois
work
with
us
that
would
be
the
better
way
and
he
could
keep
all
the
money
himself
yes
but
he
is
afraid
that
if
he
deceives
the
other
he
will
not
get
his
daughter
what
other
lupin
ganimard
pronounced
the
word
in
a
solemn
tone
somewhat
timidly
as
if
he
were
speaking
of
some
supernatural
creature
whose
claws
he
already
felt
it
is
very
strange
remarked
folenfant
judiciously
that
we
are
obliged
to
protect
this
gentleman
contrary
to
his
own
wishes
yes
but
lupin
always
turns
the
world
upside
down
said
ganimard
mournfully
a
moment
later
mon
gerbois
appeared
and
started
up
the
street
at
the
end
of
the
rue
des
capucines
he
turned
into
the
boulevards
walking
slowly
and
stopping
frequently
to
gaze
at
the
much
too
calm
too
said
ganimard
a
man
with
a
million
in
his
pocket
would
not
have
that
air
of
tranquillity
what
is
he
doing
oh
nothing
evidently
but
i
have
a
suspicion
that
it
is
lupin
yes
lupin
at
that
moment
mon
gerbois
stopped
at
a
purchased
a
paper
unfolded
it
and
commenced
to
read
it
as
he
walked
slowly
away
a
moment
later
he
gave
a
sudden
bound
into
an
automobile
that
was
standing
at
the
curb
apparently
the
machine
had
been
waiting
for
him
as
it
started
away
rapidly
turned
at
the
madeleine
and
disappeared
nom
de
nom
cried
ganimard
that
one
of
his
old
tricks
ganimard
hastened
after
the
automobile
around
the
madeleine
then
he
burst
into
laughter
at
the
entrance
to
the
boulevard
malesherbes
the
automobile
had
stopped
and
mon
gerbois
had
alighted
quick
folenfant
the
chauffeur
it
may
be
the
man
ernest
folenfant
interviewed
the
chauffeur
his
name
was
gaston
he
was
an
employee
of
the
automobile
cab
company
ten
minutes
ago
a
gentleman
had
engaged
him
and
told
him
to
wait
near
the
for
another
gentleman
and
the
second
man
what
address
did
he
give
asked
folenfant
no
address
malesherbes
avenue
de
messine
double
pourboire
that
is
all
but
during
this
time
mon
gerbois
had
leaped
into
the
first
passing
carriage
to
the
concorde
station
metropolitan
he
said
to
the
driver
he
left
the
underground
at
the
place
du
ran
to
another
carriage
and
ordered
it
to
go
to
the
place
de
la
bourse
then
a
second
journey
by
the
underground
to
the
avenue
de
villiers
followed
by
a
third
carriage
drive
to
number
rue
clapeyron
number
rue
clapeyron
is
separated
from
the
boulevard
des
batignolles
by
the
house
which
occupies
the
angle
formed
by
the
two
streets
he
ascended
to
the
first
floor
and
rang
a
gentleman
opened
the
door
does
monsieur
detinan
live
here
yes
that
is
my
name
are
you
monsieur
gerbois
yes
i
was
expecting
you
step
in
as
mon
gerbois
entered
the
lawyer
office
the
clock
struck
three
he
said
i
am
prompt
to
the
minute
is
he
here
not
yet
mon
gerbois
took
a
seat
wiped
his
forehead
looked
at
his
watch
as
if
he
did
not
know
the
time
and
inquired
anxiously
will
he
come
well
monsieur
replied
the
lawyer
that
i
do
not
know
but
i
am
quite
as
anxious
and
impatient
as
you
are
to
find
out
if
he
comes
he
will
run
a
great
risk
as
this
house
has
been
closely
watched
for
the
last
two
weeks
they
distrust
me
they
suspect
me
too
i
am
not
sure
whether
the
detectives
lost
sight
of
me
or
not
on
my
way
here
but
you
were
it
would
be
my
fault
cried
the
professor
quickly
you
can
not
reproach
me
i
promised
to
obey
his
orders
and
i
followed
them
to
the
very
letter
i
drew
the
money
at
the
time
fixed
by
him
and
i
came
here
in
the
manner
directed
by
him
i
have
faithfully
performed
my
part
of
the
agreement
let
him
do
his
after
a
short
silence
he
asked
anxiously
he
will
bring
my
daughter
wo
he
i
expect
so
but
you
have
seen
him
i
no
not
yet
he
made
the
appointment
by
letter
saying
both
of
you
would
be
here
and
asking
me
to
dismiss
my
servants
before
three
and
admit
no
one
while
you
were
here
if
i
would
not
consent
to
that
arrangement
i
was
to
notify
him
by
a
few
words
in
echo
de
but
i
am
only
too
happy
to
oblige
mon
lupin
and
so
i
consented
ah
how
will
this
end
moaned
mon
gerbois
he
took
the
from
his
pocket
placed
them
on
the
table
and
divided
them
into
two
equal
parts
then
the
two
men
sat
there
in
silence
from
time
to
time
mon
gerbois
would
listen
did
someone
ring
his
nervousness
increased
every
minute
and
monsieur
detinan
also
displayed
considerable
anxiety
at
last
the
lawyer
lost
his
patience
he
rose
abruptly
and
said
he
will
not
come
we
should
expect
it
it
would
be
folly
on
his
part
he
would
run
too
great
a
risk
and
mon
gerbois
despondent
his
hands
resting
on
the
stammered
oh
mon
dieu
i
hope
he
will
come
i
would
give
the
whole
of
that
money
to
see
my
daughter
again
the
door
opened
half
of
it
will
be
sufficient
monsieur
gerbois
these
words
were
spoken
by
a
young
man
who
now
entered
the
room
and
was
immediately
recognized
by
mon
gerbois
as
the
person
who
had
wished
to
buy
the
desk
from
him
at
versailles
he
rushed
toward
him
where
is
my
daughter
my
suzanne
arsène
lupin
carefully
closed
the
door
and
while
slowly
removing
his
gloves
said
to
the
lawyer
my
dear
maître
i
am
indebted
to
you
very
much
for
your
kindness
in
consenting
to
defend
my
interests
i
shall
not
forget
it
mon
detinan
murmured
but
you
did
not
ring
i
did
not
hear
the
door
doors
and
bells
are
things
that
should
work
without
being
heard
i
am
here
and
that
is
the
important
point
my
daughter
suzanne
where
is
she
repeated
the
professor
mon
dieu
monsieur
said
lupin
what
your
hurry
your
daughter
will
be
here
in
a
moment
lupin
walked
to
and
fro
for
a
minute
then
with
the
pompous
air
of
an
orator
he
said
monsieur
gerbois
i
congratulate
you
on
the
clever
way
in
which
you
made
the
journey
to
this
place
then
perceiving
the
two
piles
of
he
exclaimed
ah
i
see
the
million
is
here
we
will
not
lose
any
time
permit
me
one
moment
said
the
lawyer
placing
himself
before
the
table
mlle
gerbois
has
not
yet
arrived
well
is
not
her
presence
indispensable
i
understand
i
understand
arsène
lupin
inspires
only
a
limited
confidence
he
might
pocket
the
and
not
restore
the
hostage
ah
monsieur
people
do
not
understand
me
because
i
have
been
obliged
by
force
of
circumstances
to
commit
certain
actions
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary
my
good
faith
is
impugned
i
who
have
always
observed
the
utmost
scrupulosity
and
delicacy
in
business
affairs
besides
my
dear
monsieur
if
you
have
any
fear
open
the
window
and
call
there
are
at
least
a
dozen
detectives
in
the
street
do
you
think
so
arsène
lupin
raised
the
curtain
i
think
that
monsieur
gerbois
could
not
throw
ganimard
off
the
scent
what
did
i
tell
you
there
he
is
now
is
it
possible
exclaimed
the
professor
but
i
swear
to
you
that
you
have
not
betrayed
me
i
do
not
doubt
you
but
those
fellows
are
clever
sometimes
ah
i
can
see
folenfant
and
greaume
and
dieuzy
all
good
friends
of
mine
mon
detinan
looked
at
lupin
in
amazement
what
assurance
he
laughed
as
merrily
as
if
engaged
in
some
childish
sport
as
if
no
danger
threatened
him
this
unconcern
reassured
the
lawyer
more
than
the
presence
of
the
detectives
he
left
the
table
on
which
the
were
lying
arsène
lupin
picked
up
one
pile
of
bills
after
the
other
took
from
each
of
them
which
he
offered
to
mon
detinan
saying
the
reward
of
your
services
to
monsieur
gerbois
and
arsène
lupin
you
well
deserve
it
you
owe
me
nothing
replied
the
lawyer
what
after
all
the
trouble
we
have
caused
you
and
all
the
pleasure
you
have
given
me
that
means
my
dear
monsieur
that
you
do
not
wish
to
accept
anything
from
arsène
lupin
see
what
it
is
to
have
a
bad
reputation
he
then
offered
the
fifty
thousand
francs
to
mon
gerbois
saying
monsieur
in
memory
of
our
pleasant
interview
permit
me
to
return
you
this
as
a
to
mlle
gerbois
mon
gerbois
took
the
money
but
said
my
daughter
will
not
marry
she
will
not
marry
if
you
refuse
your
consent
but
she
wishes
to
marry
what
do
you
know
about
it
i
know
that
young
girls
often
dream
of
such
things
unknown
to
their
parents
fortunately
there
are
sometimes
good
genii
like
arsène
lupin
who
discover
their
little
secrets
in
the
drawers
of
their
writing
desks
did
you
find
anything
else
asked
the
lawyer
i
confess
i
am
curious
to
know
why
you
took
so
much
trouble
to
get
possession
of
that
desk
on
account
of
its
historic
interest
my
friend
although
despite
the
opinion
of
monsieur
gerbois
the
desk
contained
no
treasure
except
the
lottery
ticket
and
that
was
unknown
to
me
i
had
been
seeking
it
for
a
long
time
that
of
yew
and
mahogany
was
discovered
in
the
little
house
in
which
marie
walêwska
once
lived
in
boulogne
and
on
one
of
the
drawers
there
is
this
inscription
to
napoleon
i
emperor
of
the
french
by
his
very
faithful
servant
and
above
it
these
words
engraved
with
the
point
of
a
knife
you
marie
afterwards
napoleon
had
a
similar
desk
made
for
the
empress
josephine
so
that
the
secretary
that
was
so
much
admired
at
the
malmaison
was
only
an
imperfect
copy
of
the
one
that
will
henceforth
form
part
of
my
collection
ah
if
i
had
known
when
in
the
shop
i
would
gladly
have
given
it
up
to
you
said
the
professor
arsène
lupin
smiled
as
he
replied
and
you
would
have
had
the
advantage
of
keeping
for
your
own
use
lottery
ticket
number
and
you
would
not
have
found
it
necessary
to
abduct
my
daughter
abduct
your
daughter
yes
my
dear
monsieur
you
are
mistaken
mlle
gerbois
was
not
abducted
no
certainly
not
abduction
means
force
or
violence
and
i
assure
you
that
she
served
as
hostage
of
her
own
free
will
of
her
own
free
will
repeated
mon
gerbois
in
amazement
in
fact
she
almost
asked
to
be
taken
why
do
you
suppose
that
an
intelligent
young
girl
like
mlle
gerbois
and
who
moreover
nourishes
an
unacknowledged
passion
would
hesitate
to
do
what
was
necessary
to
secure
her
dowry
ah
i
swear
to
you
it
was
not
difficult
to
make
her
understand
that
it
was
the
only
way
to
overcome
your
obstinacy
mon
detinan
was
greatly
amused
he
replied
to
lupin
but
i
should
think
it
was
more
difficult
to
get
her
to
listen
to
you
how
did
you
approach
her
oh
i
did
approach
her
myself
i
have
not
the
honor
of
her
acquaintance
a
friend
of
mine
a
lady
carried
on
the
negotiations
the
blonde
woman
in
the
automobile
no
doubt
precisely
all
arrangements
were
made
at
the
first
interview
near
the
college
since
then
mlle
gerbois
and
her
new
friend
have
been
travelling
in
belgium
and
holland
in
a
manner
that
should
prove
most
pleasing
and
instructive
to
a
young
girl
she
will
tell
you
all
about
it
herself
the
bell
of
the
vestibule
door
rang
three
rings
in
quick
succession
followed
by
two
isolated
rings
it
is
she
said
lupin
monsieur
detinan
if
you
will
be
so
kind
the
lawyer
hastened
to
the
door
two
young
women
entered
one
of
them
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
mon
gerbois
the
other
approached
lupin
the
latter
was
a
tall
woman
of
a
good
figure
very
pale
complexion
and
with
blond
hair
parted
over
her
forehead
in
undulating
waves
that
glistened
and
shone
like
the
setting
sun
she
was
dressed
in
black
with
no
display
of
jewelled
ornaments
but
on
the
contrary
her
appearance
indicated
good
taste
and
refined
elegance
arsène
lupin
spoke
a
few
words
to
her
then
bowing
to
mlle
gerbois
he
said
i
owe
you
an
apology
mademoiselle
for
all
your
troubles
but
i
hope
you
have
not
been
too
unhappy
unhappy
why
i
should
have
been
very
happy
indeed
if
it
had
been
for
leaving
my
poor
father
then
all
is
for
the
best
kiss
him
again
and
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
it
is
an
excellent
one
to
speak
to
him
about
your
cousin
my
cousin
what
do
you
mean
i
do
understand
of
course
you
understand
your
cousin
philippe
the
young
man
whose
letters
you
kept
so
carefully
suzanne
blushed
but
following
lupin
advice
she
again
threw
herself
into
her
father
arms
lupin
gazed
upon
them
with
a
tender
look
ah
such
is
my
reward
for
a
virtuous
act
what
a
touching
picture
a
happy
father
and
a
happy
daughter
and
to
know
that
their
joy
is
your
work
lupin
hereafter
these
people
will
bless
you
and
reverently
transmit
your
name
unto
their
descendants
even
unto
the
fourth
generation
what
a
glorious
reward
lupin
for
one
act
of
kindness
he
walked
to
the
window
is
dear
old
ganimard
still
waiting
he
would
like
very
much
to
be
present
at
this
charming
domestic
scene
ah
he
is
not
there
nor
any
of
the
others
i
do
see
anyone
the
deuce
the
situation
is
becoming
serious
i
dare
say
they
are
already
under
the
talking
to
the
concierge
perhaps
or
even
ascending
the
stairs
mon
gerbois
made
a
sudden
movement
now
that
his
daughter
had
been
restored
to
him
he
saw
the
situation
in
a
different
light
to
him
the
arrest
of
his
adversary
meant
francs
instinctively
he
made
a
step
forward
as
if
by
chance
lupin
stood
in
his
way
where
are
you
going
monsieur
gerbois
to
defend
me
against
them
that
is
very
kind
of
you
but
i
assure
you
it
is
not
necessary
they
are
more
worried
than
i
then
he
continued
to
speak
with
calm
deliberation
but
really
what
do
they
know
that
you
are
here
and
perhaps
that
mlle
gerbois
is
here
for
they
may
have
seen
her
arrive
with
an
unknown
lady
but
they
do
not
imagine
that
i
am
here
how
is
it
possible
that
i
could
be
in
a
house
that
they
from
cellar
to
garret
this
morning
they
suppose
that
the
unknown
lady
was
sent
by
me
to
make
the
exchange
and
they
will
be
ready
to
arrest
her
when
she
goes
out
at
that
moment
the
bell
rang
with
a
brusque
movement
lupin
seized
mon
gerbois
and
said
to
him
in
an
imperious
tone
do
not
move
remember
your
daughter
and
be
prudent
otherwise
as
to
you
monsieur
detinan
i
have
your
promise
mon
gerbois
was
rooted
to
the
spot
the
lawyer
did
not
stir
without
the
least
sign
of
haste
lupin
picked
up
his
hat
and
brushed
the
dust
from
off
it
with
his
sleeve
my
dear
monsieur
detinan
if
i
can
ever
be
of
service
to
you
my
best
wishes
mademoiselle
suzanne
and
my
kind
regards
to
monsieur
philippe
he
drew
a
heavy
gold
watch
from
his
pocket
monsieur
gerbois
it
is
now
minutes
past
three
at
minutes
past
three
i
give
you
permission
to
leave
this
room
not
one
minute
sooner
than
minutes
past
three
but
they
will
force
an
entrance
suggested
mon
detinan
you
forget
the
law
my
dear
monsieur
ganimard
would
never
venture
to
violate
the
privacy
of
a
french
citizen
but
pardon
me
time
flies
and
you
are
all
slightly
nervous
he
placed
his
watch
on
the
table
opened
the
door
of
the
room
and
addressing
the
blonde
lady
he
said
are
you
ready
my
dear
he
drew
back
to
let
her
pass
bowed
respectfully
to
mlle
gerbois
and
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
then
they
heard
him
in
the
vestibule
speaking
in
a
loud
voice
ganimard
how
goes
it
remember
me
to
madame
ganimard
one
of
these
days
i
shall
invite
her
to
breakfast
au
revoir
ganimard
the
bell
rang
violently
followed
by
repeated
rings
and
voices
on
the
landing
minutes
muttered
mon
gerbois
after
a
few
seconds
he
left
the
room
and
stepped
into
the
vestibule
arsène
lupin
and
the
blonde
lady
had
gone
papa
you
must
wait
cried
suzanne
wait
you
are
foolish
no
quarter
for
that
rascal
and
the
he
opened
the
outer
door
ganimard
rushed
in
that
woman
where
is
she
and
lupin
he
was
here
he
is
here
ganimard
uttered
a
cry
of
triumph
we
have
him
the
house
is
surrounded
but
the
servant
stairway
suggested
mon
detinan
it
leads
to
the
court
said
ganimard
there
is
only
one
exit
the
ten
men
are
guarding
it
but
he
did
come
in
by
the
and
he
will
not
go
out
that
way
what
way
then
asked
ganimard
through
the
air
he
drew
aside
a
curtain
and
exposed
a
long
corridor
leading
to
the
kitchen
ganimard
ran
along
it
and
tried
the
door
of
the
stairway
it
was
locked
from
the
window
he
called
to
one
of
his
assistants
seen
anyone
no
then
they
are
still
in
the
house
he
exclaimed
they
are
hiding
in
one
of
the
rooms
they
can
not
have
escaped
ah
lupin
you
fooled
me
before
but
this
time
i
get
my
revenge
at
seven
in
the
evening
mon
dudonis
chief
of
the
detective
service
astonished
at
not
receiving
any
news
visited
the
rue
clapeyron
he
questioned
the
detectives
who
were
guarding
the
house
then
ascended
to
mon
detinan
apartment
the
lawyer
led
him
into
his
room
there
mon
dudonis
beheld
a
man
or
rather
two
legs
kicking
in
the
air
while
the
body
to
which
they
belonged
was
hidden
in
the
depths
of
the
chimney
ohé
ohé
gasped
a
stifled
voice
and
a
more
distant
voice
from
on
high
replied
ohé
ohé
mon
dudonis
laughed
and
exclaimed
here
ganimard
have
you
turned
the
detective
crawled
out
of
the
chimney
with
his
blackened
face
his
sooty
clothes
and
his
feverish
eyes
he
was
quite
unrecognizable
i
am
looking
for
he
growled
who
arsène
lupin
and
his
friend
well
do
you
suppose
they
are
hiding
in
the
chimney
ganimard
arose
laid
his
sooty
hand
on
the
sleeve
of
his
superior
officer
coat
and
exclaimed
angrily
where
do
you
think
they
are
chief
they
must
be
somewhere
they
are
flesh
and
blood
like
you
and
me
and
ca
fade
away
like
smoke
no
but
they
have
faded
away
just
the
same
but
how
how
the
house
is
surrounded
by
our
men
even
on
the
roof
what
about
the
adjoining
house
there
no
communication
with
it
and
the
apartments
on
the
other
floors
i
know
all
the
tenants
they
have
not
seen
anyone
are
you
sure
you
know
all
of
them
yes
the
concierge
answers
for
them
besides
as
an
extra
precaution
i
have
placed
a
man
in
each
apartment
they
ca
escape
if
i
do
get
them
i
will
get
them
i
shall
sleep
here
he
slept
there
that
night
and
the
two
following
nights
three
days
and
nights
passed
away
without
the
discovery
of
the
irrepressible
lupin
or
his
female
companion
more
than
that
ganimard
did
not
unearth
the
slightest
clue
on
which
to
base
a
theory
to
explain
their
escape
for
that
reason
he
adhered
to
his
first
opinion
there
is
no
trace
of
their
escape
therefore
they
are
here
it
may
be
that
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
his
conviction
was
less
firmly
established
but
he
would
not
confess
it
no
a
thousand
times
no
a
man
and
a
woman
could
not
vanish
like
the
evil
spirits
in
a
fairy
tale
and
without
losing
his
courage
he
continued
his
searches
as
if
he
expected
to
find
the
fugitives
concealed
in
some
impenetrable
retreat
or
embodied
in
the
stone
walls
of
the
house
chapter
ii
the
blue
diamond
on
the
evening
of
march
at
number
avenue
in
the
house
that
he
had
inherited
from
his
brother
six
months
before
the
old
general
baron
ambassador
at
berlin
under
the
second
empire
was
asleep
in
a
comfortable
armchair
while
his
secretary
was
reading
to
him
and
the
sister
auguste
was
warming
his
bed
and
preparing
the
at
eleven
the
sister
who
was
obliged
to
return
to
the
convent
of
her
order
at
that
hour
said
to
the
secretary
mademoiselle
antoinette
my
work
is
finished
i
am
going
very
well
sister
do
not
forget
that
the
cook
is
away
and
that
you
are
alone
in
the
house
with
the
servant
have
no
fear
for
the
baron
i
sleep
in
the
adjoining
room
and
always
leave
the
door
open
the
sister
left
the
house
a
few
moments
later
charles
the
servant
came
to
receive
his
orders
the
baron
was
now
awake
and
spoke
for
himself
the
usual
orders
charles
see
that
the
electric
bell
rings
in
your
room
and
at
the
first
alarm
run
for
the
doctor
now
mademoiselle
antoinette
how
far
did
we
get
in
our
reading
is
monsieur
not
going
to
bed
now
no
no
i
will
go
later
besides
i
do
need
anyone
twenty
minutes
later
he
was
sleeping
again
and
antoinette
crept
away
on
tiptoe
at
that
moment
charles
was
closing
the
shutters
on
the
lower
floor
in
the
kitchen
he
bolted
the
door
leading
to
the
garden
and
in
the
vestibule
he
not
only
locked
the
door
but
hooked
the
chain
as
well
then
he
ascended
to
his
room
on
the
third
floor
went
to
bed
and
was
soon
asleep
probably
an
hour
had
passed
when
he
leaped
from
his
bed
in
alarm
the
bell
was
ringing
it
rang
for
some
time
seven
or
eight
seconds
perhaps
without
intermission
well
muttered
charles
recovering
his
wits
another
of
the
whims
he
dressed
himself
quickly
descended
the
stairs
stopped
in
front
of
the
door
and
rapped
according
to
his
custom
he
received
no
reply
he
opened
the
door
and
entered
ah
no
light
he
murmured
what
is
that
for
then
in
a
low
voice
he
called
mademoiselle
no
reply
are
you
there
mademoiselle
what
the
matter
is
monsieur
le
baron
ill
no
reply
nothing
but
a
profound
silence
that
soon
became
depressing
he
took
two
steps
forward
his
foot
struck
a
chair
and
having
touched
it
he
noticed
that
it
was
overturned
then
with
his
hand
he
discovered
other
objects
on
the
floor
a
small
table
and
a
screen
anxiously
he
approached
the
wall
felt
for
the
electric
button
and
turned
on
the
light
in
the
centre
of
the
room
between
the
table
and
lay
the
body
of
his
master
the
baron
what
it
ca
be
possible
he
stammered
he
could
not
move
he
stood
there
with
bulging
eyes
gazing
stupidly
at
the
terrible
disorder
the
overturned
chairs
a
large
crystal
candelabra
shattered
in
a
thousand
pieces
the
clock
lying
on
the
marble
hearthstone
all
evidence
of
a
fearful
and
desperate
struggle
the
handle
of
a
stiletto
glittered
not
far
from
the
corpse
the
blade
was
stained
with
blood
a
handkerchief
marked
with
red
spots
was
lying
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
charles
recoiled
with
horror
the
body
lying
at
his
feet
extended
itself
for
a
moment
then
shrunk
up
again
two
or
three
tremors
and
that
was
the
end
he
stooped
over
the
body
there
was
a
wound
on
the
neck
from
which
the
blood
was
flowing
and
then
congealing
in
a
black
pool
on
the
carpet
the
face
retained
an
expression
of
extreme
terror
some
one
has
killed
him
he
muttered
some
one
has
killed
him
then
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
that
there
might
be
another
dreadful
crime
did
not
the
baron
secretary
sleep
in
the
adjoining
room
had
not
the
assassin
killed
her
also
he
opened
the
door
the
room
was
empty
he
concluded
that
antoinette
had
been
abducted
or
else
she
had
gone
away
before
the
crime
he
returned
to
the
baron
chamber
his
glance
falling
on
the
secretary
he
noticed
that
that
article
of
furniture
remained
intact
then
he
saw
upon
a
table
beside
a
bunch
of
keys
and
a
pocketbook
that
the
baron
placed
there
every
night
a
handful
of
golden
louis
charles
seized
the
pocketbook
opened
it
and
found
some
he
counted
them
there
were
thirteen
notes
of
one
hundred
francs
each
instinctively
mechanically
he
put
the
in
his
pocket
rushed
down
the
stairs
drew
the
bolt
unhooked
the
chain
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
fled
to
the
street
charles
was
an
honest
man
he
had
scarcely
left
the
gate
when
cooled
by
the
night
air
and
the
rain
he
came
to
a
sudden
halt
now
he
saw
his
action
in
its
true
light
and
it
filled
him
with
horror
he
hailed
a
passing
cab
and
said
to
the
driver
go
to
the
and
bring
the
commissary
hurry
there
has
been
a
murder
in
that
house
the
whipped
his
horse
charles
wished
to
return
to
the
house
but
found
the
gate
locked
he
had
closed
it
himself
when
he
came
out
and
it
could
not
be
opened
from
the
outside
on
the
other
hand
it
was
useless
to
ring
as
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
it
was
almost
an
hour
before
the
arrival
of
the
police
when
they
came
charles
told
his
story
and
handed
the
to
the
commissary
a
locksmith
was
summoned
and
after
considerable
difficulty
he
succeeded
in
forcing
open
the
garden
gate
and
the
vestibule
door
the
commissary
of
police
entered
the
room
first
but
immediately
turned
to
charles
and
said
you
told
me
that
the
room
was
in
the
greatest
disorder
charles
stood
at
the
door
amazed
bewildered
all
the
furniture
had
been
restored
to
its
accustomed
place
the
small
table
was
standing
between
the
two
windows
the
chairs
were
upright
and
the
clock
was
on
the
centre
of
the
mantel
the
debris
of
the
candelabra
had
been
removed
where
is
monsieur
le
baron
stammered
charles
that
so
exclaimed
the
officer
where
is
the
victim
he
approached
the
bed
and
drew
aside
a
large
sheet
under
which
reposed
the
baron
formerly
french
ambassador
at
berlin
over
him
lay
his
military
coat
adorned
with
the
cross
of
honor
his
features
were
calm
his
eyes
were
closed
some
one
has
been
here
said
charles
how
did
they
get
in
i
do
know
but
some
one
has
been
here
during
my
absence
there
was
a
stiletto
on
the
floor
there
and
a
handkerchief
stained
with
blood
on
the
bed
they
are
not
here
now
they
have
been
carried
away
and
some
one
has
put
the
room
in
order
who
would
do
that
the
assassin
but
we
found
all
the
doors
locked
he
must
have
remained
in
the
house
then
he
must
be
here
yet
as
you
were
in
front
of
the
house
all
the
time
charles
reflected
a
moment
then
said
slowly
yes
of
course
i
did
go
away
from
the
gate
who
was
the
last
person
you
saw
with
the
baron
mademoiselle
antoinette
his
secretary
what
has
become
of
her
i
do
know
her
bed
was
occupied
so
she
must
have
gone
out
i
am
not
surprised
at
that
as
she
is
young
and
pretty
but
how
could
she
leave
the
house
by
the
door
said
charles
but
you
had
bolted
and
chained
it
yes
but
she
must
have
left
before
that
and
the
crime
was
committed
after
her
departure
of
course
said
the
servant
the
house
was
searched
from
cellar
to
garret
but
the
assassin
had
fled
how
and
when
was
it
he
or
an
accomplice
who
had
returned
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
removed
everything
that
might
furnish
a
clue
to
his
identity
such
were
the
questions
the
police
were
called
upon
to
solve
the
coroner
came
at
seven
and
at
eight
mon
dudouis
the
head
of
the
detective
service
arrived
on
the
scene
they
were
followed
by
the
procureur
of
the
republic
and
the
investigating
magistrate
in
addition
to
these
officials
the
house
was
overrun
with
policemen
detectives
newspaper
reporters
photographers
and
relatives
and
acquaintances
of
the
murdered
man
a
thorough
search
was
made
they
studied
out
the
position
of
the
corpse
according
to
the
information
furnished
by
charles
they
questioned
sister
auguste
when
she
arrived
but
they
discovered
nothing
new
sister
auguste
was
astonished
to
learn
of
the
disappearance
of
antoinette
bréhat
she
had
engaged
the
young
girl
twelve
days
before
on
excellent
recommendations
and
refused
to
believe
that
she
would
neglect
her
duty
by
leaving
the
house
during
the
night
but
you
see
she
has
returned
yet
said
the
magistrate
and
we
are
still
confronted
with
the
question
what
has
become
of
her
i
think
she
was
abducted
by
the
assassin
said
charles
the
theory
was
plausible
and
was
borne
out
by
certain
facts
mon
dudouis
agreed
with
it
he
said
abducted
ma
foi
that
is
not
improbable
not
only
improbable
said
a
voice
but
absolutely
opposed
to
the
facts
there
is
not
a
particle
of
evidence
to
support
such
a
theory
the
voice
was
harsh
the
accent
sharp
and
no
one
was
surprised
to
learn
that
the
speaker
was
ganimard
in
no
one
else
would
they
tolerate
such
a
domineering
tone
ah
it
is
you
ganimard
exclaimed
mon
dudouis
i
had
not
seen
you
before
i
have
been
here
since
two
so
you
are
interested
in
some
things
outside
of
lottery
ticket
number
the
affair
of
the
rue
clapeyron
the
blonde
lady
and
arsène
lupin
laughed
the
veteran
detective
i
would
not
say
that
lupin
is
a
stranger
to
the
present
case
but
let
us
forget
the
affair
of
the
lottery
ticket
for
a
few
moments
and
try
to
unravel
this
new
mystery
ganimard
is
not
one
of
those
celebrated
detectives
whose
methods
will
create
a
school
or
whose
name
will
be
immortalized
in
the
criminal
annals
of
his
country
he
is
devoid
of
those
flashes
of
genius
which
characterize
the
work
of
dupin
lecoq
and
sherlock
holmes
yet
it
must
be
admitted
he
possesses
superior
qualities
of
observation
sagacity
perseverance
and
even
intuition
his
merit
lies
in
his
absolute
independence
nothing
troubles
or
influences
him
except
perhaps
a
sort
of
fascination
that
arsène
lupin
holds
over
him
however
that
may
be
there
is
no
doubt
that
his
position
on
that
morning
in
the
house
of
the
late
baron
was
one
of
undoubted
superiority
and
his
collaboration
in
the
case
was
appreciated
and
desired
by
the
investigating
magistrate
in
the
first
place
said
ganimard
i
will
ask
monsieur
charles
to
be
very
particular
on
one
point
he
says
that
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
to
the
room
various
articles
of
furniture
were
overturned
and
strewn
about
the
place
now
i
ask
him
whether
on
his
second
visit
to
the
room
he
found
all
those
articles
restored
to
their
accustomed
places
i
mean
of
course
correctly
placed
yes
all
in
their
proper
places
replied
charles
it
is
obvious
then
that
the
person
who
replaced
them
must
have
been
familiar
with
the
location
of
those
articles
the
logic
of
this
remark
was
apparent
to
his
hearers
ganimard
continued
one
more
question
monsieur
charles
you
were
awakened
by
the
ringing
of
your
bell
now
who
do
you
think
rang
it
monsieur
le
baron
of
course
when
could
he
ring
it
after
the
struggle
when
he
was
dying
impossible
because
you
found
him
lying
unconscious
at
a
point
more
than
four
metres
from
the
then
he
must
have
rung
during
the
struggle
impossible
declared
ganimard
since
the
ringing
as
you
have
said
was
continuous
and
uninterrupted
and
lasted
seven
or
eight
seconds
do
you
think
his
antagonist
would
have
permitted
him
to
ring
the
bell
in
that
leisurely
manner
well
then
it
was
before
the
attack
also
quite
impossible
since
you
have
told
us
that
the
lapse
of
time
between
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
your
entrance
to
the
room
was
not
more
than
three
minutes
therefore
if
the
baron
rang
before
the
attack
we
are
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
struggle
the
murder
and
the
flight
of
the
assassin
all
occurred
within
the
short
space
of
three
minutes
i
repeat
that
is
impossible
and
yet
said
the
magistrate
some
one
rang
if
it
were
not
the
baron
who
was
it
the
murderer
for
what
purpose
i
do
not
know
but
the
fact
that
he
did
ring
proves
that
he
knew
that
the
bell
communicated
with
the
servant
room
now
who
would
know
that
except
an
inmate
of
the
house
ganimard
was
drawing
the
meshes
of
his
net
closer
and
tighter
in
a
few
clear
and
logical
sentences
he
had
unfolded
and
defined
his
theory
of
the
crime
so
that
it
seemed
quite
natural
when
the
magistrate
said
as
i
understand
it
ganimard
you
suspect
the
girl
antoinette
bréhat
i
do
not
suspect
her
i
accuse
her
you
accuse
her
of
being
an
accomplice
i
accuse
her
of
having
killed
baron
nonsense
what
proof
have
you
the
handful
of
hair
i
found
in
the
right
hand
of
the
victim
he
produced
the
hair
it
was
of
a
beautiful
blond
color
and
glittered
like
threads
of
gold
charles
looked
at
it
and
said
that
is
mademoiselle
antoinette
hair
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
and
then
there
is
another
thing
i
believe
that
the
knife
which
i
saw
on
my
first
visit
to
the
room
belonged
to
her
she
used
it
to
cut
the
leaves
of
books
a
long
dreadful
silence
followed
as
if
the
crime
had
acquired
an
additional
horror
by
reason
of
having
been
committed
by
a
woman
at
last
the
magistrate
said
let
us
assume
until
we
are
better
informed
that
the
baron
was
killed
by
antoinette
bréhat
we
have
yet
to
learn
where
she
concealed
herself
after
the
crime
how
she
managed
to
return
after
charles
left
the
house
and
how
she
made
her
escape
after
the
arrival
of
the
police
have
you
formed
any
opinion
on
those
points
ganimard
none
well
then
where
do
we
stand
ganimard
was
embarrassed
finally
with
a
visible
effort
he
said
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
find
in
this
case
the
same
method
of
procedure
as
we
found
in
the
affair
of
the
lottery
ticket
number
the
same
phenomena
which
might
be
termed
the
faculty
of
disappearing
antoinette
bréhat
has
appeared
and
disappeared
in
this
house
as
mysteriously
as
arsène
lupin
entered
the
house
of
monsieur
detinan
and
escaped
therefrom
in
the
company
of
the
blonde
lady
does
that
signify
anything
it
does
to
me
i
can
see
a
probable
connection
between
those
two
strange
incidents
antoinette
bréhat
was
hired
by
sister
auguste
twelve
days
ago
that
is
to
say
on
the
day
after
the
blonde
lady
so
cleverly
slipped
through
my
fingers
in
the
second
place
the
hair
of
the
blonde
lady
was
exactly
of
the
same
brilliant
golden
hue
as
the
hair
found
in
this
case
so
that
in
your
opinion
antoinette
bréhat
is
the
blonde
lady
precisely
and
that
lupin
had
a
hand
in
both
cases
yes
that
is
my
opinion
this
statement
was
greeted
with
an
outburst
of
laughter
it
came
from
mon
dudouis
lupin
always
lupin
lupin
is
into
everything
lupin
is
everywhere
yes
lupin
is
into
everything
of
any
consequence
replied
ganimard
vexed
at
the
ridicule
of
his
superior
well
so
far
as
i
see
observed
mon
dudouis
you
have
not
discovered
any
motive
for
this
crime
the
secretary
was
not
broken
into
nor
the
pocketbook
carried
away
even
a
pile
of
gold
was
left
upon
the
table
yes
that
is
so
exclaimed
ganimard
but
the
famous
diamond
what
diamond
the
blue
diamond
the
celebrated
diamond
which
formed
part
of
the
royal
crown
of
france
and
which
was
given
by
the
duke
to
leonide
lebrun
and
at
the
death
of
leonide
lebrun
was
purchased
by
the
baron
as
a
souvenir
of
the
charming
comedienne
that
he
had
loved
so
well
that
is
one
of
those
things
that
an
old
parisian
like
i
does
not
forget
it
is
obvious
that
if
the
blue
diamond
is
not
found
the
motive
for
the
crime
is
disclosed
said
the
magistrate
but
where
should
we
search
for
it
on
the
baron
finger
replied
charles
he
always
wore
the
blue
diamond
on
his
left
hand
i
saw
that
hand
and
there
was
only
a
plain
gold
ring
on
it
said
ganimard
as
he
approached
the
corpse
look
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
replied
the
servant
ganimard
opened
the
stiffened
hand
the
bezel
was
turned
inward
and
in
the
centre
of
that
bezel
the
blue
diamond
shone
with
all
its
glorious
splendor
the
deuce
muttered
ganimard
absolutely
amazed
i
do
understand
it
you
will
now
apologize
to
lupin
for
having
suspected
him
eh
said
mon
dudouis
laughing
ganimard
paused
for
a
moment
reflection
and
then
replied
sententiously
it
is
only
when
i
do
not
understand
things
that
i
suspect
arsène
lupin
such
were
the
facts
established
by
the
police
on
the
day
after
the
commission
of
that
mysterious
crime
facts
that
were
vague
and
incoherent
in
themselves
and
which
were
not
explained
by
any
subsequent
discoveries
the
movements
of
antoinette
bréhat
remained
as
inexplicable
as
those
of
the
blonde
lady
and
the
police
discovered
no
trace
of
that
mysterious
creature
with
the
golden
hair
who
had
killed
baron
and
had
failed
to
take
from
his
finger
the
famous
diamond
that
had
once
shone
in
the
royal
crown
of
france
the
heirs
of
the
baron
could
not
fail
to
benefit
by
such
notoriety
they
established
in
the
house
an
exhibition
of
the
furniture
and
other
objects
which
were
to
be
sold
at
the
auction
rooms
of
drouot
modern
furniture
of
indifferent
taste
various
objects
of
no
artistic
value
but
in
the
centre
of
the
room
in
a
case
of
purple
velvet
protected
by
a
glass
globe
and
guarded
by
two
officers
was
the
famous
blue
diamond
ring
a
large
magnificent
diamond
of
incomparable
purity
and
of
that
indefinite
blue
which
the
clear
water
receives
from
an
unclouded
sky
of
that
blue
which
can
be
detected
in
the
whiteness
of
linen
some
admired
some
enthused
and
some
looked
with
horror
on
the
chamber
of
the
victim
on
the
spot
where
the
corpse
had
lain
on
the
floor
divested
of
its
carpet
and
especially
the
walls
the
unsurmountable
walls
over
which
the
criminal
must
have
passed
some
assured
themselves
that
the
marble
mantel
did
not
move
others
imagined
gaping
holes
mouths
of
tunnels
secret
connections
with
the
sewers
and
the
catacombs
the
sale
of
the
blue
diamond
took
place
at
the
salesroom
of
drouot
co
the
place
was
crowded
to
suffocation
and
the
bidding
was
carried
to
the
verge
of
folly
the
sale
was
attended
by
all
those
who
usually
appear
at
similar
events
in
paris
those
who
buy
and
those
who
make
a
pretense
of
being
able
to
buy
bankers
brokers
artists
women
of
all
classes
two
cabinet
ministers
an
italian
tenor
an
exiled
king
who
in
order
to
maintain
his
credit
bid
with
much
ostentation
and
in
a
loud
voice
as
high
as
one
hundred
thousand
francs
one
hundred
thousand
francs
he
could
offer
that
sum
without
any
danger
of
his
bid
being
accepted
the
italian
tenor
risked
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
and
a
member
of
the
bid
one
hundred
and
thousand
francs
when
the
bidding
reached
two
hundred
thousand
francs
the
smaller
competitors
fell
out
of
the
race
at
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
only
two
bidders
remained
in
the
field
herschmann
the
capitalist
the
king
of
gold
mines
and
the
countess
de
crozon
the
wealthy
american
whose
collection
of
diamonds
and
precious
stones
is
famed
throughout
the
world
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
two
hundred
and
seventy
thousand
eighty
exclaimed
the
auctioneer
as
he
glanced
at
the
two
competitors
in
succession
two
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
for
madame
do
i
hear
any
more
three
hundred
thousand
said
herschmann
there
was
a
short
silence
the
countess
was
standing
smiling
but
pale
from
excitement
she
was
leaning
against
the
back
of
the
chair
in
front
of
her
she
knew
and
so
did
everyone
present
that
the
issue
of
the
duel
was
certain
logically
inevitably
it
must
terminate
to
the
advantage
of
the
capitalist
who
had
untold
millions
with
which
to
indulge
his
caprices
however
the
countess
made
another
bid
three
hundred
and
five
thousand
another
silence
all
eyes
were
now
directed
to
the
capitalist
in
the
expectation
that
he
would
raise
the
bidding
but
herschmann
was
not
paying
any
attention
to
the
sale
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
sheet
of
paper
which
he
held
in
his
right
hand
while
the
other
hand
held
a
torn
envelope
three
hundred
and
five
thousand
repeated
the
auctioneer
once
twice
for
the
last
time
do
i
hear
any
more
once
twice
am
i
offered
any
more
last
chance
herschmann
did
not
move
third
and
last
time
sold
exclaimed
the
auctioneer
as
his
hammer
fell
four
hundred
thousand
cried
herschman
starting
up
as
if
the
sound
of
the
hammer
had
roused
him
from
his
stupor
too
late
the
auctioneer
decision
was
irrevocable
some
of
herschmann
acquaintances
pressed
around
him
what
was
the
matter
why
did
he
not
speak
sooner
he
laughed
and
said
ma
foi
i
simply
forgot
in
a
moment
of
abstraction
that
is
strange
you
see
i
just
received
a
letter
and
that
letter
was
sufficient
to
distract
my
attention
yes
for
a
moment
ganimard
was
there
he
had
come
to
witness
the
sale
of
the
ring
he
stopped
one
of
the
attendants
of
the
auction
room
and
said
was
it
you
who
carried
the
letter
to
monsieur
herschmann
yes
who
gave
it
to
you
a
lady
where
is
she
where
is
she
she
was
sitting
down
there
the
lady
who
wore
a
thick
veil
she
has
gone
yes
just
this
moment
ganimard
hastened
to
the
door
and
saw
the
lady
descending
the
stairs
he
ran
after
her
a
crush
of
people
delayed
him
at
the
entrance
when
he
reached
the
sidewalk
she
had
disappeared
he
returned
to
the
auction
room
accosted
herschmann
introduced
himself
and
enquired
about
the
letter
herschmann
handed
it
to
him
it
was
carelessly
scribbled
in
pencil
in
a
handwriting
unknown
to
the
capitalist
and
contained
these
few
words
the
blue
diamond
brings
misfortune
remember
the
baron
the
vicissitudes
of
the
blue
diamond
were
not
yet
at
an
end
although
it
had
become
through
the
murder
of
the
baron
and
the
incidents
at
the
it
was
six
months
later
that
it
attained
even
greater
celebrity
during
the
following
summer
the
countess
de
crozon
was
robbed
of
the
famous
jewel
she
had
taken
so
much
trouble
to
acquire
let
me
recall
that
strange
affair
of
which
the
exciting
and
dramatic
incidents
sent
a
thrill
through
all
of
us
and
over
which
i
am
now
permitted
to
throw
some
light
on
the
evening
of
august
the
guests
of
the
count
and
countess
de
crozon
were
assembled
in
the
of
the
magnificent
château
which
overlooks
the
bay
de
somme
to
entertain
her
friends
the
countess
seated
herself
at
the
piano
to
play
for
them
after
first
placing
her
jewels
on
a
small
table
near
the
piano
and
amongst
them
was
the
ring
of
the
baron
an
hour
later
the
count
and
the
majority
of
the
guests
retired
including
his
two
cousins
and
madame
de
réal
an
intimate
friend
of
the
countess
the
latter
remained
in
the
with
herr
bleichen
the
austrian
consul
and
his
wife
they
conversed
for
a
time
and
then
the
countess
extinguished
the
large
lamp
that
stood
on
a
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
at
the
same
moment
herr
bleichen
extinguished
the
two
piano
lamps
there
was
a
momentary
darkness
then
the
consul
lighted
a
candle
and
the
three
of
them
retired
to
their
rooms
but
as
soon
as
she
reached
her
apartment
the
countess
remembered
her
jewels
and
sent
her
maid
to
get
them
when
the
maid
returned
with
the
jewels
she
placed
them
on
the
mantel
without
the
countess
looking
at
them
next
day
madame
de
crozon
found
that
one
of
her
rings
was
missing
it
was
the
blue
diamond
ring
she
informed
her
husband
and
after
talking
it
over
they
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
maid
was
above
suspicion
and
that
the
guilty
party
must
be
herr
bleichen
the
count
notified
the
commissary
of
police
at
amiens
who
commenced
an
investigation
and
discreetly
exercised
a
strict
surveillance
over
the
austrian
consul
to
prevent
his
disposing
of
the
ring
the
château
was
surrounded
by
detectives
day
and
night
two
weeks
passed
without
incident
then
herr
bleichen
announced
his
intended
departure
that
day
a
formal
complaint
was
entered
against
him
the
police
made
an
official
examination
of
his
luggage
in
a
small
satchel
the
key
to
which
was
always
carried
by
the
consul
himself
they
found
a
bottle
of
dentifrice
and
in
that
bottle
they
found
the
ring
madame
bleichen
fainted
her
husband
was
placed
under
arrest
everyone
will
remember
the
line
of
defense
adopted
by
the
accused
man
he
declared
that
the
ring
must
have
been
placed
there
by
the
count
de
crozen
as
an
act
of
revenge
he
said
the
count
is
brutal
and
makes
his
wife
very
unhappy
she
consulted
me
and
i
advised
her
to
get
a
divorce
the
count
heard
of
it
in
some
way
and
to
be
revenged
on
me
he
took
the
ring
and
placed
it
in
my
satchel
the
count
and
countess
persisted
in
pressing
the
charge
between
the
explanation
which
they
gave
and
that
of
the
consul
both
equally
possible
and
equally
probable
the
public
had
to
choose
no
new
fact
was
discovered
to
turn
the
scale
in
either
direction
a
month
of
gossip
conjectures
and
investigations
failed
to
produce
a
single
ray
of
light
wearied
of
the
excitement
and
notoriety
and
incapable
of
securing
the
evidence
necessary
to
sustain
their
charge
against
the
consul
the
count
and
countess
at
last
sent
to
paris
for
a
detective
competent
to
unravel
the
tangled
threads
of
this
mysterious
skein
this
brought
ganimard
into
the
case
for
four
days
the
veteran
detective
searched
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
examined
every
foot
of
the
ground
had
long
conferences
with
the
maid
the
chauffeur
the
gardeners
the
employees
in
the
neighboring
visited
the
rooms
that
had
been
occupied
by
the
various
guests
then
one
morning
he
disappeared
without
taking
leave
of
his
host
or
hostess
but
a
week
later
they
received
this
telegram
please
come
to
the
japanese
rue
boissy
friday
evening
at
five
ganimard
at
five
friday
evening
their
automobile
stopped
in
front
of
number
nine
rue
the
old
detective
was
standing
on
the
sidewalk
waiting
for
them
without
a
word
he
conducted
them
to
the
first
floor
of
the
japanese
in
one
of
the
rooms
they
met
two
men
whom
ganimard
introduced
in
these
words
monsieur
gerbois
professor
in
the
college
of
versailles
from
whom
you
will
remember
arsène
lupin
stole
half
a
million
monsieur
léonce
nephew
and
sole
legatee
of
the
baron
a
few
minutes
later
another
man
arrived
it
was
mon
dudouis
head
of
the
detective
service
and
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
particularly
bad
temper
he
bowed
and
then
said
what
the
trouble
now
ganimard
i
received
your
telephone
message
asking
me
to
come
here
is
it
anything
of
consequence
yes
chief
it
is
a
very
important
matter
within
an
hour
the
last
two
cases
to
which
i
was
assigned
will
have
their
dénouement
here
it
seemed
to
me
that
your
presence
was
indispensable
and
also
the
presence
of
dieuzy
and
folenfant
whom
i
noticed
standing
near
the
door
as
i
came
in
yes
chief
for
what
are
you
going
to
make
an
arrest
and
you
wish
to
do
it
with
a
flourish
come
ganimard
i
am
anxious
to
hear
about
it
ganimard
hesitated
a
moment
then
spoke
with
the
obvious
intention
of
making
an
impression
on
his
hearers
in
the
first
place
i
wish
to
state
that
herr
bleichen
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
theft
of
the
ring
oh
oh
exclaimed
mon
dudouis
that
is
a
bold
statement
and
a
very
serious
one
and
is
that
all
you
have
discovered
asked
the
count
de
crozon
not
at
all
on
the
second
day
after
the
theft
three
of
your
guests
went
on
an
automobile
trip
as
far
as
crécy
two
of
them
visited
the
famous
battlefield
and
while
they
were
there
the
third
party
paid
a
hasty
visit
to
the
and
mailed
a
small
box
tied
and
sealed
according
to
the
regulations
and
declared
its
value
to
be
one
hundred
francs
i
see
nothing
strange
in
that
said
the
count
perhaps
you
will
see
something
strange
in
it
when
i
tell
you
that
this
person
in
place
of
giving
her
true
name
sent
the
box
under
the
name
of
rousseau
and
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
a
certain
monsieur
beloux
of
paris
moved
his
place
of
residence
immediately
after
receiving
the
box
in
other
words
the
ring
i
presume
you
refer
to
one
of
my
cousins
no
replied
ganimard
madame
de
réal
then
yes
you
accuse
my
friend
madam
de
réal
cried
the
countess
shocked
and
amazed
i
wish
to
ask
you
one
question
madame
said
ganimard
was
madam
de
réal
present
when
you
purchased
the
ring
yes
but
we
did
not
go
there
together
did
she
advise
you
to
buy
the
ring
the
countess
considered
for
a
moment
then
said
yes
i
think
she
mentioned
it
first
thank
you
madame
your
answer
establishes
the
fact
that
it
was
madame
de
réal
who
was
the
first
to
mention
the
ring
and
it
was
she
who
advised
you
to
buy
it
but
i
consider
my
friend
is
quite
incapable
pardon
me
countess
when
i
remind
you
that
madame
de
réal
is
only
a
casual
acquaintance
and
not
your
intimate
friend
as
the
newspapers
have
announced
it
was
only
last
winter
that
you
met
her
for
the
first
time
now
i
can
prove
that
everything
she
has
told
you
about
herself
her
past
life
and
her
relatives
is
absolutely
false
that
madame
blanche
de
réal
had
no
actual
existence
before
she
met
you
and
she
has
now
ceased
to
exist
well
well
replied
ganimard
your
story
is
a
very
strange
one
said
the
countess
but
it
has
no
application
to
our
case
if
madame
de
réal
had
taken
the
ring
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
it
was
found
in
herr
bleichen
anyone
who
would
take
the
risk
and
trouble
of
stealing
the
blue
diamond
would
certainly
keep
it
what
do
you
say
to
that
i
nothing
but
madame
de
réal
will
answer
it
oh
she
does
exist
then
she
does
and
does
not
i
will
explain
in
a
few
words
three
days
ago
while
reading
a
newspaper
i
glanced
over
the
list
of
hotel
arrivals
at
trouville
and
there
i
read
beaurivage
madame
de
réal
etc
i
went
to
trouville
immediately
and
interviewed
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
from
the
description
and
other
information
i
received
from
him
i
concluded
that
she
was
the
very
madame
de
réal
that
i
was
seeking
but
she
had
left
the
hotel
giving
her
address
in
paris
as
number
three
rue
de
colisée
the
day
before
yesterday
i
went
to
that
address
and
learned
that
there
was
no
person
there
called
madame
de
réal
but
there
was
a
madame
réal
living
on
the
second
floor
who
acted
as
a
diamond
broker
and
was
frequently
away
from
home
she
had
returned
from
a
journey
on
the
preceding
evening
yesterday
i
called
on
her
and
under
an
assumed
name
i
offered
to
act
as
an
intermedium
in
the
sale
of
some
diamonds
to
certain
wealthy
friends
of
mine
she
is
to
meet
me
here
to
carry
out
that
arrangement
what
you
expect
her
to
come
here
yes
at
five
are
you
sure
it
is
she
madame
de
réal
of
the
château
de
crozon
certainly
i
have
convincing
evidence
of
that
fact
but
listen
i
hear
folenfant
signal
it
was
a
whistle
ganimard
arose
quickly
there
is
no
time
to
lose
monsieur
and
madame
de
crozon
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
go
into
the
next
room
you
also
monsieur
and
you
monsieur
gerbois
the
door
will
remain
open
and
when
i
give
the
signal
you
will
come
out
of
course
chief
you
will
remain
here
we
may
be
disturbed
by
other
people
said
mon
dudouis
no
this
is
a
new
establishment
and
the
proprietor
is
one
of
my
friends
he
will
not
let
anyone
disturb
us
except
the
blonde
lady
the
blonde
lady
what
do
you
mean
yes
the
blonde
lady
herself
chief
the
friend
and
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
the
mysterious
blonde
lady
against
whom
i
hold
convincing
evidence
but
in
addition
to
that
i
wish
to
confront
her
with
all
the
people
she
has
robbed
he
looked
through
the
window
i
see
her
she
is
coming
in
the
door
now
she
ca
escape
folenfant
and
dieuzy
are
guarding
the
door
the
blonde
lady
is
captured
at
last
chief
a
moment
later
a
woman
appeared
at
the
door
she
was
tall
and
slender
with
a
very
pale
complexion
and
bright
golden
hair
ganimard
trembled
with
excitement
he
could
not
move
nor
utter
a
word
she
was
there
in
front
of
him
at
his
mercy
what
a
victory
over
arsène
lupin
and
what
a
revenge
and
at
the
same
time
the
victory
was
such
an
easy
one
that
he
asked
himself
if
the
blonde
lady
would
not
yet
slip
through
his
fingers
by
one
of
those
miracles
that
usually
terminated
the
exploits
of
arsène
lupin
she
remained
standing
near
the
door
surprised
at
the
silence
and
looked
about
her
without
any
display
of
suspicion
or
fear
she
will
get
away
she
will
disappear
thought
ganimard
then
he
managed
to
get
between
her
and
the
door
she
turned
to
go
out
no
no
he
said
why
are
you
going
away
really
monsieur
i
do
not
understand
what
this
means
allow
me
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
go
madame
and
very
good
reasons
why
you
should
remain
but
it
is
useless
madame
you
can
not
go
trembling
she
sat
on
a
chair
and
stammered
what
is
it
you
want
ganimard
had
won
the
battle
and
captured
the
blonde
lady
he
said
to
her
allow
me
to
present
the
friend
i
mentioned
who
desires
to
purchase
some
diamonds
have
you
procured
the
stones
you
promised
to
bring
no
no
i
do
know
i
do
remember
come
jog
your
memory
a
person
of
your
acquaintance
intended
to
send
you
a
tinted
stone
like
the
blue
diamond
i
said
laughing
and
you
replied
i
expect
to
have
just
what
you
want
do
you
remember
she
made
no
reply
a
small
satchel
fell
from
her
hand
she
picked
it
up
quickly
and
held
it
securely
her
hands
trembled
slightly
come
said
ganimard
i
see
you
have
no
confidence
in
us
madame
de
réal
i
shall
set
you
a
good
example
by
showing
you
what
i
have
he
took
from
his
pocketbook
a
paper
which
he
unfolded
and
disclosed
a
lock
of
hair
these
are
a
few
hairs
torn
from
the
head
of
antoinette
bréhat
by
the
baron
which
i
found
clasped
in
his
dead
hand
i
have
shown
them
to
mlle
gerbois
who
declares
they
are
of
the
exact
color
of
the
hair
of
the
blonde
lady
besides
they
are
exactly
the
color
of
your
hair
the
identical
color
madame
réal
looked
at
him
in
bewilderment
as
if
she
did
not
understand
his
meaning
he
continued
and
here
are
two
perfume
bottles
without
labels
it
is
true
and
empty
but
still
sufficiently
impregnated
with
their
odor
to
enable
mlle
gerbois
to
recognize
in
them
the
perfume
used
by
that
blonde
lady
who
was
her
traveling
companion
for
two
weeks
now
one
of
these
bottles
was
found
in
the
room
that
madame
de
réal
occupied
at
the
château
de
crozon
and
the
other
in
the
room
that
you
occupied
at
the
hôtel
beaurivage
what
do
you
say
the
blonde
lady
the
château
de
crozon
the
detective
did
not
reply
he
took
from
his
pocket
and
placed
on
the
table
side
by
side
four
small
sheets
of
paper
then
he
said
i
have
on
these
four
pieces
of
paper
various
specimens
of
handwriting
the
first
is
the
writing
of
antoinette
bréhat
the
second
was
written
by
the
woman
who
sent
the
note
to
baron
herschmann
at
the
auction
sale
of
the
blue
diamond
the
third
is
that
of
madame
de
réal
written
while
she
was
stopping
at
the
château
de
crozon
and
the
fourth
is
your
handwriting
madame
it
is
your
name
and
address
which
you
gave
to
the
porter
of
the
hôtel
beaurivage
at
trouville
now
compare
the
four
handwritings
they
are
identical
what
absurdity
is
this
really
monsieur
i
do
not
understand
what
does
it
mean
it
means
madame
exclaimed
ganimard
that
the
blonde
lady
the
friend
and
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
is
none
other
than
you
madame
réal
ganimard
went
to
the
adjoining
room
and
returned
with
mon
gerbois
whom
he
placed
in
front
of
madame
réal
as
he
said
monsieur
gerbois
is
this
the
person
who
abducted
your
daughter
the
woman
you
saw
at
the
house
of
monsieur
detinan
no
ganimard
was
so
surprised
that
he
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
finally
he
said
no
you
must
be
mistaken
i
am
not
mistaken
madame
is
blonde
it
is
true
and
in
that
respect
resembles
the
blonde
lady
but
in
all
other
respects
she
is
totally
different
i
ca
believe
it
you
must
be
mistaken
ganimard
called
in
his
other
witnesses
monsieur
he
said
do
you
recognize
antoinette
bréhat
no
this
is
not
the
person
i
saw
at
my
uncle
house
this
woman
is
not
madame
de
réal
declared
the
count
de
crozon
that
was
the
finishing
touch
ganimard
was
crushed
he
was
buried
beneath
the
ruins
of
the
structure
he
had
erected
with
so
much
care
and
assurance
his
pride
was
humbled
his
spirit
was
broken
by
the
force
of
this
unexpected
blow
mon
dudouis
arose
and
said
we
owe
you
an
apology
madame
for
this
unfortunate
mistake
but
since
your
arrival
here
i
have
noticed
your
nervous
agitation
something
troubles
you
may
i
ask
what
it
is
mon
dieu
monsieur
i
was
afraid
my
satchel
contains
diamonds
to
the
value
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
and
the
conduct
of
your
friend
was
rather
suspicious
but
you
were
frequently
absent
from
paris
how
do
you
explain
that
i
make
frequent
journeys
to
other
cities
in
the
course
of
my
business
that
is
all
mon
dudouis
had
nothing
more
to
ask
he
turned
to
his
subordinate
and
said
your
investigation
has
been
very
superficial
ganimard
and
your
conduct
toward
this
lady
is
really
deplorable
you
will
come
to
my
office
and
explain
it
the
interview
was
at
an
end
and
mon
dudouis
was
about
to
leave
the
room
when
a
most
annoying
incident
occurred
madame
réal
turned
to
ganimard
and
said
i
understand
that
you
are
monsieur
ganimard
am
i
right
yes
then
this
letter
must
be
for
you
i
received
it
this
morning
it
was
addressed
to
justin
ganimard
care
of
madame
réal
i
thought
it
was
a
joke
because
i
did
not
know
you
under
that
name
but
it
appears
that
your
unknown
correspondent
knew
of
our
rendezvous
ganimard
was
inclined
to
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
unread
but
he
dared
not
do
so
in
the
presence
of
his
superior
so
he
opened
the
envelope
and
read
the
letter
aloud
in
an
almost
inaudible
tone
once
upon
a
time
there
were
a
blonde
lady
a
lupin
and
a
ganimard
now
the
wicked
ganimard
had
evil
designs
on
the
pretty
blonde
lady
and
the
good
lupin
was
her
friend
and
protector
when
the
good
lupin
wished
the
blonde
lady
to
become
the
friend
of
the
countess
de
crozon
he
caused
her
to
assume
the
name
of
madame
de
réal
which
is
a
close
resemblance
to
the
name
of
a
certain
diamond
broker
a
woman
with
a
pale
complexion
and
golden
hair
and
the
good
lupin
said
to
himself
if
ever
the
wicked
ganimard
gets
upon
the
track
of
the
blonde
lady
how
useful
it
will
be
to
me
if
he
should
be
diverted
to
the
track
of
the
honest
diamond
broker
a
wise
precaution
that
has
borne
good
fruit
a
little
note
sent
to
the
newspaper
read
by
the
wicked
ganimard
a
perfume
bottle
intentionally
forgotten
by
the
genuine
blonde
lady
at
the
hôtel
beaurivage
the
name
and
address
of
madame
réal
written
on
the
hotel
register
by
the
genuine
blonde
lady
and
the
trick
is
played
what
do
you
think
of
it
ganimard
i
wished
to
tell
you
the
true
story
of
this
affair
knowing
that
you
would
be
the
first
to
laugh
over
it
really
it
is
quite
amusing
and
i
have
enjoyed
it
very
much
accept
my
best
wishes
dear
friend
and
give
my
kind
regards
to
the
worthy
mon
dudouis
arsène
lupin
he
knows
everything
muttered
ganimard
but
he
did
not
see
the
humor
of
the
situation
as
lupin
had
predicted
he
knows
some
things
i
have
never
mentioned
to
any
one
how
could
he
find
out
that
i
was
going
to
invite
you
here
chief
how
could
he
know
that
i
had
found
the
first
perfume
bottle
how
could
he
find
out
those
things
he
stamped
his
feet
and
tore
his
hair
a
prey
to
the
most
tragic
despair
mon
dudouis
felt
sorry
for
him
and
said
come
ganimard
never
mind
try
to
do
better
next
time
and
mon
dudouis
left
the
room
accompanied
by
madame
réal
during
the
next
ten
minutes
ganimard
read
and
the
letter
of
arsène
lupin
monsieur
and
madame
de
crozon
monsieur
and
monsieur
gerbois
were
holding
an
animated
discussion
in
a
corner
of
the
room
at
last
the
count
approached
the
detective
and
said
my
dear
monsieur
after
your
investigation
we
are
no
nearer
the
truth
than
we
were
before
pardon
me
but
my
investigation
has
established
these
facts
that
the
blonde
lady
is
the
mysterious
heroine
of
these
exploits
and
that
arsène
lupin
directed
them
those
facts
do
not
solve
the
mystery
in
fact
they
render
it
more
obscure
the
blonde
lady
commits
a
murder
in
order
to
steal
the
blue
diamond
and
yet
she
does
not
steal
it
afterward
she
steals
it
and
gets
rid
of
it
by
secretly
giving
it
to
another
person
how
do
you
explain
her
strange
conduct
i
can
not
explain
it
of
course
but
perhaps
someone
else
can
who
the
count
hesitated
so
the
countess
replied
frankly
there
is
only
one
man
besides
yourself
who
is
competent
to
enter
the
arena
with
arsène
lupin
and
overcome
him
have
you
any
objection
to
our
engaging
the
services
of
herlock
sholmes
in
this
case
ganimard
was
vexed
at
the
question
but
stammered
a
reply
no
but
i
do
not
understand
what
let
me
explain
all
this
mystery
annoys
me
i
wish
to
have
it
cleared
up
monsieur
gerbois
and
monsieur
have
the
same
desire
and
we
have
agreed
to
send
for
the
celebrated
english
detective
you
are
right
madame
replied
the
detective
with
a
loyalty
that
did
him
credit
you
are
right
old
ganimard
is
not
able
to
overcome
arsène
lupin
but
will
herlock
sholmes
succeed
i
hope
so
as
i
have
the
greatest
admiration
for
him
but
it
is
improbable
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
will
not
succeed
that
is
my
opinion
i
can
foresee
the
result
of
a
duel
between
herlock
sholmes
and
arsène
lupin
the
englishman
will
be
defeated
but
in
any
event
can
we
count
on
your
assistance
quite
so
madame
i
shall
be
pleased
to
render
monsieur
sholmes
all
possible
assistance
do
you
know
his
address
yes
parker
street
that
evening
monsieur
and
madame
de
crozon
withdrew
the
charge
they
had
made
against
herr
bleichen
and
a
joint
letter
was
addressed
to
herlock
sholmes
chapter
iii
herlock
sholmes
opens
hostilities
what
does
monsieur
wish
anything
replied
arsène
lupin
like
a
man
who
never
worries
over
the
details
of
a
meal
anything
you
like
but
no
meat
or
alcohol
the
waiter
walked
away
disdainfully
what
still
a
vegetarian
i
exclaimed
more
so
than
ever
replied
lupin
through
taste
faith
or
habit
hygiene
and
do
you
never
fall
from
grace
oh
yes
when
i
am
dining
out
and
wish
to
avoid
being
considered
eccentric
we
were
dining
near
the
northern
railway
station
in
a
little
restaurant
to
which
arsène
lupin
had
invited
me
frequently
he
would
send
me
a
telegram
asking
me
to
meet
him
in
some
obscure
restaurant
where
we
could
enjoy
a
quiet
dinner
well
served
and
which
was
always
made
interesting
to
me
by
his
recital
of
some
startling
adventure
theretofore
unknown
to
me
on
that
particular
evening
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
more
lively
mood
than
usual
he
laughed
and
joked
with
careless
animation
and
with
that
delicate
sarcasm
that
was
habitual
with
him
a
light
and
spontaneous
sarcasm
that
was
quite
free
from
any
tinge
of
malice
it
was
a
pleasure
to
find
him
in
that
jovial
mood
and
i
could
not
resist
the
desire
to
tell
him
so
ah
yes
he
exclaimed
there
are
days
in
which
i
find
life
as
bright
and
gay
as
a
spring
morning
then
life
seems
to
be
an
infinite
treasure
which
i
can
never
exhaust
and
yet
god
knows
i
lead
a
careless
existence
too
much
so
perhaps
ah
but
i
tell
you
the
treasure
is
infinite
i
can
spend
it
with
a
lavish
hand
i
can
cast
my
youth
and
strength
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
and
it
is
replaced
by
a
still
younger
and
greater
force
besides
my
life
is
so
pleasant
if
i
wished
to
do
so
i
might
become
what
shall
i
say
an
orator
a
manufacturer
a
politician
but
i
assure
you
i
shall
never
have
such
a
desire
arsène
lupin
i
am
arsène
lupin
i
shall
remain
i
have
made
a
vain
search
in
history
to
find
a
career
comparable
to
mine
a
life
better
filled
or
more
intense
napoleon
yes
perhaps
but
napoleon
toward
the
close
of
his
career
when
all
europe
was
trying
to
crush
him
asked
himself
on
the
eve
of
each
battle
if
it
would
not
be
his
last
was
he
serious
or
was
he
joking
he
became
more
animated
as
he
proceeded
that
is
everything
do
you
understand
the
danger
the
continuous
feeling
of
danger
to
breathe
it
as
you
breathe
the
air
to
scent
it
in
every
breath
of
wind
to
detect
it
in
every
unusual
sound
and
in
the
midst
of
the
tempest
to
remain
calm
and
not
to
stumble
otherwise
you
are
lost
there
is
only
one
sensation
equal
to
it
that
of
the
chauffeur
in
an
automobile
race
but
that
race
lasts
only
a
few
hours
my
race
continues
until
death
what
fantasy
i
exclaimed
and
you
wish
me
to
believe
that
you
have
no
particular
motive
for
your
adoption
of
that
exciting
life
come
he
said
with
a
smile
you
are
a
clever
psychologist
work
it
out
for
yourself
he
poured
himself
a
glass
of
water
drank
it
and
said
did
you
read
no
herlock
sholmes
crossed
the
channel
this
afternoon
and
arrived
in
paris
about
six
the
deuce
what
is
he
coming
for
a
little
journey
he
has
undertaken
at
the
request
of
the
count
and
countess
of
crozon
monsieur
gerbois
and
the
nephew
of
baron
they
met
him
at
the
northern
railway
station
took
him
to
meet
ganimard
and
at
this
moment
the
six
of
them
are
holding
a
consultation
despite
a
strong
temptation
to
do
so
i
had
never
ventured
to
question
arsène
lupin
concerning
any
action
of
his
private
life
unless
he
had
first
mentioned
the
subject
to
me
up
to
that
moment
his
name
had
not
been
mentioned
at
least
officially
in
connection
with
the
blue
diamond
consequently
i
consumed
my
curiosity
in
patience
he
continued
there
is
also
in
an
interview
with
my
old
friend
ganimard
according
to
whom
a
certain
blonde
lady
who
should
be
my
friend
must
have
murdered
the
baron
and
tried
to
rob
madame
de
crozon
of
her
famous
ring
and
what
do
you
think
he
accuses
me
of
being
the
instigator
of
those
crimes
i
could
not
suppress
a
slight
shudder
was
this
true
must
i
believe
that
his
career
of
theft
his
mode
of
existence
the
logical
result
of
such
a
life
had
drawn
that
man
into
more
serious
crimes
including
murder
i
looked
at
him
he
was
so
calm
and
his
eyes
had
such
a
frank
expression
i
observed
his
hands
they
had
been
formed
from
a
model
of
exceeding
delicacy
long
and
slender
inoffensive
truly
and
the
hands
of
an
artist
ganimard
has
i
said
no
no
protested
lupin
ganimard
has
some
cleverness
and
at
times
almost
inspiration
inspiration
yes
for
instance
that
interview
is
a
in
the
first
place
he
announces
the
coming
of
his
english
rival
in
order
to
put
me
on
my
guard
and
make
his
task
more
difficult
in
the
second
place
he
indicates
the
exact
point
to
which
he
has
conducted
the
affair
in
order
that
sholmes
will
not
get
credit
for
the
work
already
done
by
ganimard
that
is
good
warfare
whatever
it
may
be
you
have
two
adversaries
to
deal
with
and
such
adversaries
oh
one
of
them
does
count
and
the
other
sholmes
oh
i
confess
he
is
a
worthy
foe
and
that
explains
my
present
good
humor
in
the
first
place
it
is
a
question
of
i
am
pleased
to
know
that
they
consider
me
a
subject
worthy
the
attention
of
the
celebrated
english
detective
in
the
next
place
just
imagine
the
pleasure
a
man
such
as
i
must
experience
in
the
thought
of
a
duel
with
herlock
sholmes
but
i
shall
be
obliged
to
strain
every
muscle
he
is
a
clever
fellow
and
will
contest
every
inch
of
the
ground
then
you
consider
him
a
strong
opponent
i
do
as
a
detective
i
believe
he
has
never
had
an
equal
but
i
have
one
advantage
over
him
he
is
making
the
attack
and
i
am
simply
defending
myself
my
rôle
is
the
easier
one
besides
i
am
familiar
with
his
method
of
warfare
and
he
does
not
know
mine
i
am
prepared
to
show
him
a
few
new
tricks
that
will
give
him
something
to
think
about
he
tapped
the
table
with
his
fingers
as
he
uttered
the
following
sentences
with
an
air
of
keen
delight
arsène
lupin
against
herlock
sholmes
france
against
england
trafalgar
will
be
revenged
at
last
ah
the
rascal
he
suspect
that
i
am
prepared
and
a
lupin
warned
he
stopped
suddenly
seized
with
a
fit
of
coughing
and
hid
his
face
in
his
napkin
as
if
something
had
stuck
in
his
throat
a
bit
of
bread
i
inquired
drink
some
water
no
it
is
that
he
replied
in
a
stifled
voice
then
what
is
it
the
want
of
air
do
you
wish
a
window
opened
no
i
shall
go
out
give
me
my
hat
and
overcoat
quick
i
must
go
what
the
matter
the
two
gentlemen
who
came
in
just
now
look
at
the
taller
one
now
when
we
go
out
keep
to
my
left
so
he
will
not
see
me
the
one
who
is
sitting
behind
you
yes
i
will
explain
it
to
you
outside
who
is
it
herlock
sholmes
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
control
himself
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
his
emotion
replaced
his
napkin
drank
a
glass
of
water
and
quite
recovered
said
to
me
smiling
it
is
strange
hein
that
i
should
be
affected
so
easily
but
that
unexpected
sight
what
have
you
to
fear
since
no
one
can
recognize
you
on
account
of
your
many
transformations
every
time
i
see
you
it
seems
to
me
your
face
is
changed
it
not
at
all
familiar
i
do
know
why
but
would
recognize
me
said
lupin
he
has
seen
me
only
once
but
at
that
time
he
made
a
mental
photograph
of
me
not
of
my
external
appearance
but
of
my
very
soul
not
what
i
appear
to
be
but
just
what
i
am
do
you
understand
and
then
and
then
i
did
not
expect
to
meet
him
here
such
a
strange
encounter
in
this
little
restaurant
well
shall
we
go
out
no
not
now
said
lupin
what
are
you
going
to
do
the
better
way
is
to
act
frankly
to
have
confidence
in
him
trust
him
you
will
not
speak
to
him
why
not
it
will
be
to
my
advantage
to
do
so
and
find
out
what
he
knows
and
perhaps
what
he
thinks
at
present
i
have
the
feeling
that
his
gaze
is
on
my
neck
and
shoulders
and
that
he
is
trying
to
remember
where
he
has
seen
them
before
he
reflected
a
moment
i
observed
a
malicious
smile
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
then
obedient
i
think
to
a
whim
of
his
impulsive
nature
and
not
to
the
necessities
of
the
situation
he
arose
turned
around
and
with
a
bow
and
a
joyous
air
he
said
by
what
lucky
chance
ah
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
permit
me
to
introduce
a
friend
of
mine
for
a
moment
the
englishman
was
disconcerted
then
he
made
a
movement
as
if
he
would
seize
arsène
lupin
the
latter
shook
his
head
and
said
that
would
not
be
fair
besides
the
movement
would
be
an
awkward
one
and
quite
useless
the
englishman
looked
about
him
as
if
in
search
of
assistance
no
use
said
lupin
besides
are
you
quite
sure
you
can
place
your
hand
on
me
come
now
show
me
that
you
are
a
real
englishman
and
therefore
a
good
sport
this
advice
seemed
to
commend
itself
to
the
detective
for
he
partially
rose
and
said
very
formally
monsieur
wilson
my
friend
and
assistant
monsieur
arsène
lupin
wilson
amazement
evoked
a
laugh
with
bulging
eyes
and
gaping
mouth
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
unable
to
comprehend
the
situation
herlock
sholmes
laughed
and
said
wilson
you
should
conceal
your
astonishment
at
an
incident
which
is
one
of
the
most
natural
in
the
world
why
do
you
not
arrest
him
stammered
wilson
have
you
not
observed
wilson
that
the
gentleman
is
between
me
and
the
door
and
only
a
few
steps
from
the
door
by
the
time
i
could
move
my
little
finger
he
would
be
outside
do
let
that
make
any
difference
said
lupin
who
now
walked
around
the
table
and
seated
himself
so
that
the
englishman
was
between
him
and
the
door
thus
placing
himself
at
the
mercy
of
the
foreigner
wilson
looked
at
sholmes
to
find
out
if
he
had
the
right
to
admire
this
act
of
wanton
courage
the
englishman
face
was
impenetrable
but
a
moment
later
he
called
waiter
when
the
waiter
came
he
ordered
soda
beer
and
whisky
the
treaty
of
peace
was
signed
until
further
orders
in
a
few
moments
the
four
men
were
conversing
in
an
apparently
friendly
manner
herlock
sholmes
is
a
man
such
as
you
might
meet
every
day
in
the
business
world
he
is
about
fifty
years
of
age
and
looks
as
if
he
might
have
passed
his
life
in
an
office
adding
up
columns
of
dull
figures
or
writing
out
formal
statements
of
business
accounts
there
was
nothing
to
distinguish
him
from
the
average
citizen
of
london
except
the
appearance
of
his
eyes
his
terribly
keen
and
penetrating
eyes
but
then
he
is
herlock
sholmes
which
means
that
he
is
a
wonderful
combination
of
intuition
observation
clairvoyance
and
ingenuity
one
could
readily
believe
that
nature
had
been
pleased
to
take
the
two
most
extraordinary
detectives
that
the
imagination
of
man
has
hitherto
conceived
the
dupin
of
edgar
allen
poe
and
the
lecoq
of
emile
gaboriau
and
out
of
that
material
constructed
a
new
detective
more
extraordinary
and
supernatural
than
either
of
them
and
when
a
person
reads
the
history
of
his
exploits
which
have
made
him
famous
throughout
the
entire
world
he
asks
himself
whether
herlock
sholmes
is
not
a
mythical
personage
a
fictitious
hero
born
in
the
brain
of
a
great
novelist
conan
doyle
for
instance
when
arsène
lupin
questioned
him
in
regard
to
the
length
of
his
sojourn
in
france
he
turned
the
conversation
into
its
proper
channel
by
saying
that
depends
on
you
monsieur
oh
exclaimed
lupin
laughing
if
it
depends
on
me
you
can
return
to
england
that
is
a
little
too
soon
but
i
expect
to
return
in
the
course
of
eight
or
nine
days
ten
at
the
outside
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
i
have
many
cases
to
attend
to
such
as
the
robbery
of
the
bank
the
abduction
of
lady
eccleston
but
do
you
think
monsieur
lupin
that
i
can
finish
my
business
in
paris
within
a
week
certainly
if
you
confine
your
efforts
to
the
case
of
the
blue
diamond
it
is
moreover
the
length
of
time
that
i
require
to
make
preparations
for
my
safety
in
case
the
solution
of
that
affair
should
give
you
certain
dangerous
advantages
over
me
and
yet
said
the
englishman
i
expect
to
close
the
business
in
eight
or
ten
days
and
arrest
me
on
the
eleventh
perhaps
no
the
tenth
is
my
limit
lupin
shook
his
head
thoughtfully
as
he
said
that
will
be
difficult
very
difficult
difficult
perhaps
but
possible
therefore
certain
absolutely
certain
said
wilson
as
if
he
had
clearly
worked
out
the
long
series
of
operations
which
would
conduct
his
collaborator
to
the
desired
result
of
course
said
herlock
sholmes
i
do
not
hold
all
the
trump
cards
as
these
cases
are
already
several
months
old
and
i
lack
certain
information
and
clues
upon
which
i
am
accustomed
to
base
my
investigations
such
as
spots
of
mud
and
cigarette
ashes
said
wilson
with
an
air
of
importance
in
addition
to
the
remarkable
conclusions
formed
by
monsieur
ganimard
i
have
obtained
all
the
articles
written
on
the
subject
and
have
formed
a
few
deductions
of
my
own
some
ideas
which
were
suggested
to
us
by
analysis
or
hypothesis
added
wilson
sententiously
i
wish
to
enquire
said
arsène
lupin
in
that
deferential
tone
which
he
employed
in
speaking
to
sholmes
would
i
be
indiscreet
if
i
were
to
ask
you
what
opinion
you
have
formed
about
the
case
really
it
was
a
most
exciting
situation
to
see
those
two
men
facing
each
other
across
the
table
engaged
in
an
earnest
discussion
as
if
they
were
obliged
to
solve
some
abstruse
problem
or
come
to
an
agreement
upon
some
controverted
fact
wilson
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
herlock
sholmes
filled
his
pipe
slowly
lighted
it
and
said
this
affair
is
much
simpler
than
it
appeared
to
be
at
first
sight
much
simpler
said
wilson
as
a
faithful
echo
i
say
affair
for
in
my
opinion
there
is
only
one
said
sholmes
the
death
of
the
baron
the
story
of
the
ring
and
let
us
not
forget
the
mystery
of
lottery
ticket
number
are
only
different
phases
of
what
one
might
call
the
mystery
of
the
blonde
lady
now
according
to
my
view
it
is
simply
a
question
of
discovering
the
bond
that
unites
those
three
episodes
in
the
same
story
the
fact
which
proves
the
unity
of
the
three
events
ganimard
whose
judgment
is
rather
superficial
finds
that
unity
in
the
faculty
of
disappearance
that
is
in
the
power
of
coming
and
going
unseen
and
unheard
that
theory
does
not
satisfy
me
well
what
is
your
idea
asked
lupin
in
my
opinion
said
sholmes
the
characteristic
feature
of
the
three
episodes
is
your
design
and
purpose
of
leading
the
affair
into
a
certain
channel
previously
chosen
by
you
it
is
on
your
part
more
than
a
plan
it
is
a
necessity
an
indispensable
condition
of
success
can
you
furnish
any
details
of
your
theory
certainly
for
example
from
the
beginning
of
your
conflict
with
monsieur
gerbois
is
it
not
evident
that
the
apartment
of
monsieur
detinan
is
the
place
selected
by
you
the
inevitable
spot
where
all
the
parties
must
meet
in
your
opinion
it
was
the
only
safe
place
and
you
arranged
a
rendezvous
there
publicly
one
might
say
for
the
blonde
lady
and
mademoiselle
gerbois
the
professor
daughter
added
wilson
now
let
us
consider
the
case
of
the
blue
diamond
did
you
try
to
appropriate
it
while
the
baron
possessed
it
no
but
the
baron
takes
his
brother
house
six
months
later
we
have
the
intervention
of
antoinette
bréhat
and
the
first
attempt
the
diamond
escapes
you
and
the
sale
is
widely
advertised
to
take
place
at
the
drouot
will
it
be
a
free
and
open
sale
is
the
richest
amateur
sure
to
carry
off
the
jewel
no
just
as
the
banker
herschmann
is
on
the
point
of
buying
the
ring
a
lady
sends
him
a
letter
of
warning
and
it
is
the
countess
de
crozon
prepared
and
influenced
by
the
same
lady
who
becomes
the
purchaser
of
the
diamond
will
the
ring
disappear
at
once
no
you
lack
the
opportunity
therefore
you
must
wait
at
last
the
countess
goes
to
her
château
that
is
what
you
were
waiting
for
the
ring
disappears
to
reappear
again
in
the
of
herr
bleichen
remarked
lupin
oh
such
nonsense
exclaimed
sholmes
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
do
tell
me
such
a
fairy
tale
i
am
too
old
a
fox
to
be
led
away
by
a
false
scent
what
do
you
mean
what
do
i
mean
said
sholmes
then
paused
a
moment
as
if
he
wished
to
arrange
his
effect
at
last
he
said
the
blue
diamond
that
was
found
in
the
was
false
you
kept
the
genuine
stone
arsène
lupin
remained
silent
for
a
moment
then
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
englishman
he
replied
calmly
you
are
impertinent
monsieur
impertinent
indeed
repeated
wilson
beaming
with
admiration
yes
said
lupin
and
yet
to
do
you
credit
you
have
thrown
a
strong
light
on
a
very
mysterious
subject
not
a
magistrate
not
a
special
reporter
who
has
been
engaged
on
this
case
has
come
so
near
the
truth
it
is
a
marvellous
display
of
intuition
and
logic
oh
a
person
has
simply
to
use
his
brains
said
herlock
sholmes
nattered
at
the
homage
of
the
expert
criminal
and
so
few
have
any
brains
to
use
replied
lupin
and
now
that
the
field
of
conjectures
has
been
narrowed
down
and
the
rubbish
cleared
away
well
now
i
have
simply
to
discover
why
the
three
episodes
were
enacted
at
rue
clapeyron
avenue
and
within
the
walls
of
the
château
de
crozon
and
my
work
will
be
finished
what
remains
will
be
child
play
do
you
think
so
yes
i
think
you
are
right
in
that
case
monsieur
lupin
am
i
wrong
in
saying
that
my
business
will
be
finished
in
ten
days
in
ten
days
you
will
know
the
whole
truth
said
lupin
and
you
will
be
arrested
no
no
in
order
that
i
may
be
arrested
there
must
occur
such
a
series
of
improbable
and
unexpected
misfortunes
that
i
can
not
admit
the
possibility
of
such
an
event
we
have
a
saying
in
england
that
unexpected
always
happens
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
calmly
and
fearlessly
without
any
display
of
bravado
or
malice
they
met
as
equals
in
a
contest
of
wit
and
skill
and
this
meeting
was
the
formal
crossing
of
swords
preliminary
to
the
duel
ah
exclaimed
lupin
at
last
i
shall
have
an
adversary
worthy
of
the
name
one
whose
defeat
will
be
the
proudest
achievement
in
my
career
are
you
not
afraid
asked
wilson
almost
monsieur
wilson
replied
lupin
rising
from
his
chair
and
the
proof
is
that
i
am
about
to
make
a
hasty
retreat
then
we
will
say
ten
days
monsieur
sholmes
yes
ten
days
this
is
sunday
a
week
from
next
wednesday
at
eight
in
the
evening
it
will
be
all
over
and
i
shall
be
in
prison
no
doubt
of
it
ha
not
a
pleasant
outlook
for
a
man
who
gets
so
much
enjoyment
out
of
life
as
i
do
no
cares
a
lively
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
world
a
justifiable
contempt
for
the
police
and
the
consoling
sympathy
of
numerous
friends
and
admirers
and
now
behold
all
that
is
about
to
be
changed
it
is
the
reverse
side
of
the
medal
after
sunshine
comes
the
rain
it
is
no
longer
a
laughing
matter
adieu
hurry
up
said
wilson
full
of
solicitude
for
a
person
in
whom
herlock
sholmes
had
inspired
so
much
respect
do
not
lose
a
minute
not
a
minute
monsieur
wilson
but
i
wish
to
express
my
pleasure
at
having
met
you
and
to
tell
you
how
much
i
envy
the
master
in
having
such
a
valuable
assistant
as
you
seem
to
be
then
after
they
had
courteously
saluted
each
other
like
adversaries
in
a
duel
who
entertain
no
feeling
of
malice
but
are
obliged
to
fight
by
force
of
circumstances
lupin
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
drew
me
outside
what
do
you
think
of
it
dear
boy
the
strange
events
of
this
evening
will
form
an
interesting
chapter
in
the
memoirs
you
are
now
preparing
for
me
he
closed
the
door
of
the
restaurant
behind
us
and
after
taking
a
few
steps
he
stopped
and
said
do
you
smoke
no
nor
do
you
it
seems
to
me
you
are
right
i
do
he
lighted
a
cigarette
with
a
which
he
shook
several
times
in
an
effort
to
extinguish
it
but
he
threw
away
the
cigarette
immediately
ran
across
the
street
and
joined
two
men
who
emerged
from
the
shadows
as
if
called
by
a
signal
he
conversed
with
them
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
opposite
sidewalk
and
then
returned
to
me
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
fear
that
cursed
sholmes
is
going
to
give
me
trouble
but
i
assure
you
he
is
not
yet
through
with
arsène
lupin
he
will
find
out
what
kind
of
fuel
i
use
to
warm
my
blood
and
now
au
revoir
the
genial
wilson
is
right
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
he
walked
away
rapidly
thus
ended
the
events
of
that
exciting
evening
or
at
least
that
part
of
them
in
which
i
was
a
participant
subsequently
during
the
course
of
the
evening
other
stirring
incidents
occurred
which
have
come
to
my
knowledge
through
the
courtesy
of
other
members
of
that
unique
at
the
very
moment
in
which
lupin
left
me
herlock
sholmes
rose
from
the
table
and
looked
at
his
watch
twenty
minutes
to
nine
at
nine
i
am
to
meet
the
count
and
countess
at
the
railway
station
then
we
must
be
off
exclaimed
wilson
between
two
drinks
of
whisky
they
left
the
restaurant
wilson
do
look
behind
we
may
be
followed
and
in
that
case
let
us
act
as
if
we
did
not
care
wilson
i
want
your
opinion
why
was
lupin
in
that
restaurant
to
get
something
to
eat
replied
wilson
quickly
wilson
i
must
congratulate
you
on
the
accuracy
of
your
deduction
i
could
have
done
better
myself
wilson
blushed
with
pleasure
and
sholmes
continued
to
get
something
to
eat
very
well
and
after
that
probably
to
assure
himself
whether
i
am
going
to
the
château
de
crozon
as
announced
by
ganimard
in
his
interview
i
must
go
in
order
not
to
disappoint
him
but
in
order
to
gain
time
on
him
i
shall
not
go
ah
said
wilson
nonplused
you
my
friend
will
walk
down
this
street
take
a
carriage
two
three
carriages
return
later
and
get
the
valises
that
we
left
at
the
station
and
make
for
the
at
a
galop
and
when
i
reach
the
engage
a
room
go
to
sleep
and
await
my
orders
quite
proud
of
the
important
rôle
assigned
to
him
wilson
set
out
to
perform
his
task
herlock
sholmes
proceeded
to
the
railway
station
bought
a
ticket
and
repaired
to
the
amiens
express
in
which
the
count
and
countess
de
crozon
were
already
installed
he
bowed
to
them
lighted
his
pipe
and
had
a
quiet
smoke
in
the
corridor
the
train
started
ten
minutes
later
he
took
a
seat
beside
the
countess
and
said
to
her
have
you
the
ring
here
madame
yes
will
you
kindly
let
me
see
it
he
took
it
and
examined
it
closely
just
as
i
suspected
it
is
a
manufactured
diamond
a
manufactured
diamond
yes
a
new
process
which
consists
in
submitting
diamond
dust
to
a
tremendous
heat
until
it
melts
and
is
then
molded
into
a
single
stone
but
my
diamond
is
genuine
yes
diamond
is
but
this
is
not
yours
where
is
mine
it
is
held
by
arsène
lupin
and
this
stone
was
substituted
for
yours
and
slipped
into
herr
where
it
was
afterwards
found
then
you
think
this
is
false
absolutely
false
the
countess
was
overwhelmed
with
surprise
and
grief
while
her
husband
scrutinized
the
diamond
with
an
incredulous
air
finally
she
stammered
is
it
possible
and
why
did
they
not
merely
steal
it
and
be
done
with
it
and
how
did
they
steal
it
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
going
to
find
out
at
the
château
de
crozon
no
i
shall
leave
the
train
at
creil
and
return
to
paris
it
is
there
the
game
between
me
and
arsène
lupin
must
be
played
in
fact
the
game
has
commenced
already
and
lupin
thinks
i
am
on
my
way
to
the
château
but
what
does
it
matter
to
you
madame
the
essential
thing
is
your
diamond
is
it
not
yes
well
do
worry
i
have
just
undertaken
a
much
more
difficult
task
than
that
you
have
my
promise
that
i
will
restore
the
true
diamond
to
you
within
ten
days
the
train
slackened
its
speed
he
put
the
false
diamond
in
his
pocket
and
opened
the
door
the
count
cried
out
that
is
the
wrong
side
of
the
train
you
are
getting
out
on
the
tracks
that
is
my
intention
if
lupin
has
anyone
on
my
track
he
will
lose
sight
of
me
now
adieu
an
employee
protested
in
vain
after
the
departure
of
the
train
the
englishman
sought
the
office
forty
minutes
later
he
leaped
into
a
train
that
landed
him
in
paris
shortly
before
midnight
he
ran
across
the
platform
entered
the
made
his
exit
at
another
door
and
jumped
into
a
cab
driver
rue
clapeyron
having
reached
the
conclusion
that
he
was
not
followed
he
stopped
the
carriage
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
proceeded
to
make
a
careful
examination
of
monsieur
detinan
house
and
the
two
adjoining
houses
he
made
measurements
of
certain
distances
and
entered
the
figures
in
his
notebook
driver
avenue
at
the
corner
of
the
avenue
and
the
rue
de
la
pompe
he
dismissed
the
carriage
walked
down
the
street
to
number
and
performed
the
same
operations
in
front
of
the
house
of
the
late
baron
and
the
two
adjoining
houses
measuring
the
width
of
the
respective
façades
and
calculating
the
depth
of
the
little
gardens
that
stood
in
front
of
them
the
avenue
was
deserted
and
was
very
dark
under
its
four
rows
of
trees
between
which
at
considerable
intervals
a
few
struggled
in
vain
to
light
the
deep
shadows
one
of
them
threw
a
dim
light
over
a
portion
of
the
house
and
sholmes
perceived
the
sign
posted
on
the
gate
the
neglected
walks
which
encircled
the
small
lawn
and
the
large
bare
windows
of
the
vacant
house
i
suppose
he
said
to
himself
the
house
has
been
unoccupied
since
the
death
of
the
baron
ah
if
i
could
only
get
in
and
view
the
scene
of
the
murder
no
sooner
did
the
idea
occur
to
him
than
he
sought
to
put
it
in
execution
but
how
could
he
manage
it
he
could
not
climb
over
the
gate
it
was
too
high
so
he
took
from
his
pocket
an
electric
lantern
and
a
skeleton
key
which
he
always
carried
then
to
his
great
surprise
he
discovered
that
the
gate
was
not
locked
in
fact
it
was
open
about
three
or
four
inches
he
entered
the
garden
and
was
careful
to
leave
the
gate
as
he
had
found
it
partly
open
but
he
had
not
taken
many
steps
from
the
gate
when
he
stopped
he
had
seen
a
light
pass
one
of
the
windows
on
the
second
floor
he
saw
the
light
pass
a
second
window
and
a
third
but
he
saw
nothing
else
except
a
silhouette
outlined
on
the
walls
of
the
rooms
the
light
descended
to
the
first
floor
and
for
a
long
time
wandered
from
room
to
room
who
the
deuce
is
walking
at
one
in
the
morning
through
the
house
in
which
the
baron
was
killed
herlock
sholmes
asked
himself
deeply
interested
there
was
only
one
way
to
find
out
and
that
was
to
enter
the
house
himself
he
did
not
hesitate
but
started
for
the
door
of
the
house
however
at
the
moment
when
he
crossed
the
streak
of
gaslight
that
came
from
the
the
man
must
have
seen
him
for
the
light
in
the
house
was
suddenly
extinguished
and
herlock
sholmes
did
not
see
it
again
softly
he
tried
the
door
it
was
open
also
hearing
no
sound
he
advanced
through
the
hallway
encountered
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
ascended
to
the
first
floor
here
there
was
the
same
silence
the
same
darkness
he
entered
one
of
the
rooms
and
approached
a
window
through
which
came
a
feeble
light
from
the
outside
on
looking
through
the
window
he
saw
the
man
who
had
no
doubt
descended
by
another
stairway
and
escaped
by
another
door
the
man
was
threading
his
way
through
the
shrubbery
which
bordered
the
wall
that
separated
the
two
gardens
the
deuce
exclaimed
sholmes
he
is
going
to
escape
he
hastened
down
the
stairs
and
leaped
over
the
steps
in
his
eagerness
to
cut
off
the
man
retreat
but
he
did
not
see
anyone
and
owing
to
the
darkness
it
was
several
seconds
before
he
was
able
to
distinguish
a
bulky
form
moving
through
the
shrubbery
this
gave
the
englishman
food
for
reflection
why
had
the
man
not
made
his
escape
which
he
could
have
done
so
easily
had
he
remained
in
order
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
intruder
who
had
disturbed
him
in
his
mysterious
work
at
all
events
concluded
sholmes
it
is
not
lupin
he
would
be
more
adroit
it
may
be
one
of
his
men
for
several
minutes
herlock
sholmes
remained
motionless
with
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
adversary
who
in
his
turn
was
watching
the
detective
but
as
that
adversary
had
become
passive
and
as
the
englishman
was
not
one
to
consume
his
time
in
idle
waiting
he
examined
his
revolver
to
see
if
it
was
in
good
working
order
remove
his
knife
from
its
sheath
and
walked
toward
the
enemy
with
that
cool
effrontery
and
scorn
of
danger
for
which
he
had
become
famous
he
heard
a
clicking
sound
it
was
his
adversary
preparing
his
revolver
herlock
sholmes
dashed
boldly
into
the
thicket
and
grappled
with
his
foe
there
was
a
sharp
desperate
struggle
in
the
course
of
which
sholmes
suspected
that
the
man
was
trying
to
draw
a
knife
but
the
englishman
believing
his
antagonist
to
be
an
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
and
anxious
to
win
the
first
trick
in
the
game
with
that
redoubtable
foe
fought
with
unusual
strength
and
determination
he
hurled
his
adversary
to
the
ground
held
him
there
with
the
weight
of
his
body
and
gripping
him
by
the
throat
with
one
hand
he
used
his
free
hand
to
take
out
his
electric
lantern
press
the
button
and
throw
the
light
over
the
face
of
his
prisoner
wilson
he
exclaimed
in
amazement
herlock
sholmes
stammered
a
weak
stifled
voice
for
a
long
time
they
remained
silent
astounded
foolish
the
shriek
of
an
automobile
rent
the
air
a
slight
breeze
stirred
the
leaves
suddenly
herlock
sholmes
seized
his
friend
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
him
violently
as
he
cried
what
are
you
doing
here
tell
me
what
did
i
tell
you
to
hide
in
the
bushes
and
spy
on
me
spy
on
you
muttered
wilson
why
i
did
know
it
was
you
but
what
are
you
doing
here
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
i
was
in
bed
you
ought
to
be
asleep
i
was
asleep
well
what
brought
you
here
asked
sholmes
your
letter
my
letter
i
do
understand
yes
a
messenger
brought
it
to
me
at
the
hotel
from
me
are
you
crazy
it
is
true
i
swear
it
where
is
the
letter
wilson
handed
him
a
sheet
of
paper
which
he
read
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
it
was
as
follows
wilson
come
at
once
to
avenue
the
house
is
empty
inspect
the
whole
place
and
make
an
exact
plan
then
return
to
herlock
sholmes
i
was
measuring
the
rooms
said
wilson
when
i
saw
a
shadow
in
the
garden
i
had
only
one
idea
that
was
to
seize
the
shadow
the
idea
was
excellent
but
remember
this
wilson
whenever
you
receive
a
letter
from
me
be
sure
it
is
my
handwriting
and
not
a
forgery
ah
exclaimed
wilson
as
the
truth
dawned
on
him
then
the
letter
was
from
you
no
who
sent
it
then
arsène
lupin
why
for
what
purpose
asked
wilson
i
do
know
and
that
what
worries
me
i
do
understand
why
he
took
the
trouble
to
disturb
you
of
course
if
he
had
sent
me
on
such
a
foolish
errand
i
would
be
surprised
but
what
was
his
object
in
disturbing
you
i
must
hurry
back
to
the
hotel
so
must
i
wilson
they
arrived
at
the
gate
wilson
who
was
ahead
took
hold
of
it
and
pulled
ah
you
closed
it
he
said
no
i
left
it
partly
open
sholmes
tried
the
gate
then
alarmed
he
examined
the
lock
an
oath
escaped
him
good
god
it
is
locked
locked
with
a
key
he
shook
the
gate
with
all
his
strength
then
realizing
the
futility
of
his
efforts
he
dropped
his
arms
discouraged
and
muttered
in
a
jerky
manner
i
can
see
it
all
now
it
is
lupin
he
that
i
would
leave
the
train
at
creil
and
he
prepared
this
neat
little
trap
for
me
in
case
i
should
commence
my
investigation
this
evening
moreover
he
was
kind
enough
to
send
me
a
companion
to
share
my
captivity
all
done
to
make
me
lose
a
day
and
perhaps
also
to
teach
me
to
mind
my
own
business
do
you
mean
to
say
we
are
prisoners
exactly
herlock
sholmes
and
wilson
are
the
prisoners
of
arsène
lupin
it
a
bad
beginning
but
he
laughs
best
who
laughs
last
wilson
seized
sholmes
arm
and
exclaimed
look
look
up
there
a
light
a
light
shone
through
one
of
the
windows
of
the
first
floor
both
of
them
ran
to
the
house
and
each
ascended
by
the
stairs
he
had
used
on
coming
out
a
short
time
before
and
they
met
again
at
the
entrance
to
the
lighted
chamber
a
small
piece
of
a
candle
was
burning
in
the
center
of
the
room
beside
it
there
was
a
basket
containing
a
bottle
a
roasted
chicken
and
a
loaf
of
bread
sholmes
was
greatly
amused
and
laughed
heartily
wonderful
we
are
invited
to
supper
it
is
really
an
enchanted
place
a
genuine
come
wilson
cheer
up
this
is
not
a
funeral
all
very
funny
are
you
quite
sure
it
is
so
very
funny
asked
wilson
in
a
lugubrious
tone
am
i
sure
exclaimed
sholmes
with
a
gaiety
that
was
too
boisterous
to
be
natural
why
to
tell
the
truth
it
the
funniest
thing
i
ever
saw
it
a
jolly
good
comedy
what
a
master
of
sarcasm
this
arsène
lupin
is
he
makes
a
fool
of
you
with
the
utmost
grace
and
delicacy
i
miss
this
feast
for
all
the
money
in
the
bank
of
england
come
wilson
you
grieve
me
you
should
display
that
nobility
of
character
which
rises
superior
to
misfortune
i
do
see
that
you
have
any
cause
for
complaint
really
i
do
after
a
time
by
dint
of
good
humor
and
sarcasm
he
managed
to
restore
wilson
to
his
normal
mood
and
make
him
swallow
a
morsel
of
chicken
and
a
glass
of
wine
but
when
the
candle
went
out
and
they
prepared
to
spend
the
night
there
with
the
bare
floor
for
a
mattress
and
the
hard
wall
for
a
pillow
the
harsh
and
ridiculous
side
of
the
situation
was
impressed
upon
them
that
particular
incident
will
not
form
a
pleasant
page
in
the
memoirs
of
the
famous
detective
next
morning
wilson
awoke
stiff
and
cold
a
slight
noise
attracted
his
attention
herlock
sholmes
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
critically
examining
some
grains
of
sand
and
studying
some
now
almost
effaced
which
formed
certain
figures
and
numbers
which
figures
he
entered
in
his
notebook
accompanied
by
wilson
who
was
deeply
interested
in
the
work
he
examined
each
room
and
found
similar
in
two
other
apartments
he
noticed
also
two
circles
on
the
oaken
panels
an
arrow
on
a
wainscot
and
four
figures
on
four
steps
of
the
stairs
at
the
end
of
an
hour
wilson
said
the
figures
are
correct
are
they
i
do
know
but
at
all
events
they
mean
something
replied
sholmes
who
had
forgotten
the
discomforts
of
the
night
in
the
joy
created
by
his
new
discoveries
it
is
quite
obvious
said
wilson
they
represent
the
number
of
pieces
in
the
floor
ah
yes
and
the
two
circles
indicate
that
the
panels
are
false
as
you
can
readily
ascertain
and
the
arrow
points
in
the
direction
in
which
the
panels
move
herlock
sholmes
looked
at
wilson
in
astonishment
ah
my
dear
friend
how
do
you
know
all
that
your
clairvoyance
makes
my
poor
ability
in
that
direction
look
quite
insignificant
oh
it
is
very
simple
said
wilson
inflated
with
pride
i
examined
those
marks
last
night
according
to
your
instructions
or
rather
according
to
the
instructions
of
arsène
lupin
since
he
wrote
the
letter
you
sent
to
me
at
that
moment
wilson
faced
a
greater
danger
than
he
had
during
his
struggle
in
the
garden
with
herlock
sholmes
the
latter
now
felt
a
furious
desire
to
strangle
him
but
dominating
his
feelings
sholmes
made
a
grimace
which
was
intended
for
a
smile
and
said
quite
so
wilson
you
have
done
well
and
your
work
shows
commendable
progress
but
tell
me
have
you
exercised
your
powers
of
observation
and
analysis
on
any
other
points
i
might
profit
by
your
deductions
oh
no
i
went
no
farther
that
a
pity
your
début
was
such
a
promising
one
but
since
that
is
all
we
may
as
well
go
go
but
how
can
we
get
out
the
way
all
honest
people
go
out
through
the
gate
but
it
is
locked
it
will
be
opened
by
whom
please
call
the
two
policemen
who
are
strolling
down
the
avenue
but
but
what
it
is
very
humiliating
what
will
be
said
when
it
becomes
known
that
herlock
sholmes
and
wilson
were
the
prisoners
of
arsène
lupin
of
course
i
understand
they
will
roar
with
laughter
replied
herlock
sholmes
in
a
dry
voice
and
with
frowning
features
but
we
ca
set
up
housekeeping
in
this
place
and
you
will
not
try
to
find
another
way
out
no
but
the
man
who
brought
us
the
basket
of
provisions
did
not
cross
the
garden
coming
or
going
there
is
some
other
way
out
let
us
look
for
it
and
not
bother
with
the
police
your
argument
is
sound
but
you
forget
that
all
the
detectives
in
paris
have
been
trying
to
find
it
for
the
last
six
months
and
that
i
searched
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
while
you
were
asleep
ah
my
dear
wilson
we
have
not
been
accustomed
to
pursue
such
game
as
arsène
lupin
he
leaves
no
trail
behind
him
at
eleven
herlock
sholmes
and
wilson
were
liberated
and
conducted
to
the
nearest
police
station
where
the
commissary
after
subjecting
them
to
a
severe
examination
released
them
with
an
affectation
of
that
was
quite
exasperating
i
am
very
sorry
messieurs
that
this
unfortunate
incident
has
occurred
you
will
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
french
hospitality
mon
dieu
what
a
night
you
must
have
passed
ah
that
rascally
lupin
is
no
respecter
of
persons
they
took
a
carriage
to
their
hotel
at
the
office
wilson
asked
for
the
key
of
his
room
after
some
search
the
clerk
replied
much
astonished
but
monsieur
you
have
given
up
the
room
i
gave
it
up
when
this
morning
by
the
letter
your
friend
brought
here
what
friend
the
gentleman
who
brought
your
letter
ah
your
card
is
still
attached
to
the
letter
here
they
are
wilson
looked
at
them
certainly
it
was
one
of
his
cards
and
the
letter
was
in
his
handwriting
good
lord
he
muttered
this
is
another
of
his
tricks
and
he
added
aloud
where
is
my
luggage
your
friend
took
it
ah
and
you
gave
it
to
him
certainly
on
the
strength
of
your
letter
and
card
of
course
of
course
they
left
the
hotel
and
walked
slowly
and
thoughtfully
through
the
the
avenue
was
bright
and
cheerful
beneath
a
clear
autumn
sun
the
air
was
mild
and
pleasant
at
herlock
sholmes
lighted
his
pipe
then
wilson
spoke
i
ca
understand
you
sholmes
you
are
so
calm
and
unruffled
they
play
with
you
as
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
and
yet
you
do
not
say
a
word
sholmes
stopped
as
he
replied
wilson
i
was
thinking
of
your
card
well
the
point
is
this
here
is
a
man
who
in
view
of
a
possible
struggle
with
us
procures
specimens
of
our
handwriting
and
who
holds
in
his
possession
one
or
more
of
your
cards
now
have
you
considered
how
much
precaution
and
skill
those
facts
represent
well
well
wilson
to
overcome
an
enemy
so
well
prepared
and
so
thoroughly
equipped
requires
the
infinite
shrewdness
of
of
a
herlock
sholmes
and
yet
as
you
have
seen
wilson
i
have
lost
the
first
round
at
six
the
de
published
the
following
article
in
its
evening
edition
this
morning
mon
thenard
commissary
of
police
in
the
sixteenth
district
released
herlock
sholmes
and
his
friend
wilson
both
of
whom
had
been
locked
in
the
house
of
the
late
baron
where
they
spent
a
very
pleasant
night
thanks
to
the
thoughtful
care
and
attention
of
arsène
lupin
in
addition
to
their
other
troubles
these
gentlemen
have
been
robbed
of
their
valises
and
in
consequence
thereof
they
have
entered
a
formal
complaint
against
arsène
lupin
arsène
lupin
satisfied
that
he
has
given
them
a
mild
reproof
hopes
these
gentlemen
will
not
force
him
to
resort
to
more
stringent
measures
bah
exclaimed
herlock
sholmes
crushing
the
paper
in
his
hands
that
is
only
child
play
and
that
is
the
only
criticism
i
have
to
make
of
arsène
lupin
he
plays
to
the
gallery
there
is
that
much
of
the
fakir
in
him
ah
sholmes
you
are
a
wonderful
man
you
have
such
a
command
over
your
temper
nothing
ever
disturbs
you
no
nothing
disturbs
me
replied
sholmes
in
a
voice
that
trembled
from
rage
besides
what
the
use
of
losing
my
temper
i
am
quite
confident
of
the
final
result
i
shall
have
the
last
word
chapter
iv
light
in
the
darkness
however
a
man
character
may
be
and
herlock
sholmes
is
one
of
those
men
over
whom
has
little
or
no
hold
there
are
circumstances
wherein
the
most
courageous
combatant
feels
the
necessity
of
marshaling
his
forces
before
risking
the
chances
of
a
battle
i
shall
take
a
vacation
said
sholmes
and
what
shall
i
do
asked
wilson
you
wilson
let
me
see
you
can
buy
some
underwear
and
linen
to
replenish
our
wardrobe
while
i
take
a
rest
very
well
sholmes
i
will
watch
while
you
sleep
wilson
uttered
these
words
with
all
the
importance
of
a
sentinel
on
guard
at
the
outpost
and
therefore
exposed
to
the
greatest
danger
his
chest
was
expanded
his
muscles
were
tense
assuming
a
shrewd
look
he
scrutinized
officially
the
little
room
in
which
they
had
fixed
their
abode
very
well
wilson
you
can
watch
i
shall
occupy
myself
in
the
preparation
of
a
line
of
attack
more
appropriate
to
the
methods
of
the
enemy
we
are
called
upon
to
meet
do
you
see
wilson
we
have
been
deceived
in
this
fellow
lupin
my
opinion
is
that
we
must
commence
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
affair
and
even
before
that
if
possible
but
have
we
sufficient
time
nine
days
dear
boy
that
is
five
too
many
the
englishman
spent
the
entire
afternoon
in
smoking
and
sleeping
he
did
not
enter
upon
his
new
plan
of
attack
until
the
following
day
then
he
said
wilson
i
am
ready
let
us
attack
the
enemy
lead
on
macduff
exclaimed
wilson
full
of
martial
ardor
i
wish
to
fight
in
the
front
rank
oh
have
no
fear
i
shall
do
credit
to
my
king
and
country
for
i
am
an
englishman
in
the
first
place
sholmes
had
three
long
and
important
interviews
with
monsieur
detinan
whose
rooms
he
examined
with
the
greatest
care
and
precision
with
suzanne
gerbois
whom
he
questioned
in
regard
to
the
blonde
lady
and
with
sister
auguste
who
had
retired
to
the
convent
of
the
visitandines
since
the
murder
of
baron
at
each
of
these
interviews
wilson
had
remained
outside
and
each
time
he
asked
satisfactory
quite
so
i
was
sure
we
were
on
the
right
track
they
paid
a
visit
to
the
two
houses
adjoining
that
of
the
late
baron
in
the
avenue
then
they
visited
the
rue
clapeyron
and
while
he
was
examining
the
front
of
number
sholmes
said
all
these
houses
must
be
connected
by
secret
passages
but
i
ca
find
them
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
wilson
doubted
the
omnipotence
of
his
famous
associate
why
did
he
now
talk
so
much
and
accomplish
so
little
why
exclaimed
sholmes
in
answer
to
wilson
secret
thought
because
with
this
fellow
lupin
a
person
has
to
work
in
the
dark
and
instead
of
deducting
the
truth
from
established
facts
a
man
must
extract
it
from
his
own
brain
and
afterward
learn
if
it
is
supported
by
the
facts
in
the
case
but
what
about
the
secret
passages
they
must
exist
but
even
though
i
should
discover
them
and
thus
learn
how
arsène
lupin
made
his
entrance
to
the
lawyer
house
and
how
the
blonde
lady
escaped
from
the
house
of
baron
after
the
murder
what
good
would
it
do
how
would
it
help
me
would
it
furnish
me
with
a
weapon
of
attack
let
us
attack
him
just
the
same
exclaimed
wilson
who
had
scarcely
uttered
these
words
when
he
jumped
back
with
a
cry
of
alarm
something
had
fallen
at
their
feet
it
was
a
bag
filled
with
sand
which
might
have
caused
them
serious
injury
if
it
had
struck
them
sholmes
looked
up
some
men
were
working
on
a
scaffolding
attached
to
the
balcony
at
the
fifth
floor
of
the
house
he
said
we
were
lucky
one
step
more
and
that
heavy
bag
would
have
fallen
on
our
heads
i
wonder
if
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
he
rushed
into
the
house
up
the
five
flights
of
stairs
rang
the
bell
pushed
his
way
into
the
apartment
to
the
great
surprise
and
alarm
of
the
servant
who
came
to
the
door
and
made
his
way
to
the
balcony
in
front
of
the
house
but
there
was
no
one
there
where
are
the
workmen
who
were
here
a
moment
ago
he
asked
the
servant
they
have
just
gone
which
way
did
they
go
by
the
servants
stairs
sholmes
leaned
out
of
the
window
he
saw
two
men
leaving
the
house
carrying
bicycles
they
mounted
them
and
quickly
disappeared
around
the
corner
how
long
have
they
been
working
on
this
scaffolding
those
men
only
since
this
morning
it
their
first
day
sholmes
returned
to
the
street
and
joined
wilson
together
they
returned
to
the
hotel
and
thus
the
second
day
ended
in
a
mournful
silence
on
the
following
day
their
programme
was
almost
similar
they
sat
together
on
a
bench
in
the
avenue
much
to
disgust
who
did
not
find
it
amusing
to
spend
long
hours
watching
the
house
in
which
the
tragedy
had
occurred
what
do
you
expect
sholmes
that
arsène
lupin
will
walk
out
of
the
house
no
that
the
blonde
lady
will
make
her
appearance
no
what
i
am
looking
for
something
to
occur
some
slight
incident
that
will
furnish
me
with
a
clue
to
work
on
and
if
it
does
not
occur
then
i
must
myself
create
the
spark
that
will
set
fire
to
the
powder
a
solitary
incident
and
that
of
a
disagreeable
nature
broke
the
monotony
of
the
forenoon
a
gentleman
was
riding
along
the
avenue
when
his
horse
suddenly
turned
aside
in
such
a
manner
that
it
ran
against
the
bench
on
which
they
were
sitting
and
struck
sholmes
a
slight
blow
on
the
shoulder
ha
exclaimed
sholmes
a
little
more
and
i
would
have
had
a
broken
shoulder
the
gentleman
struggled
with
his
horse
the
englishman
drew
his
revolver
and
pointed
it
but
wilson
seized
his
arm
and
said
do
be
foolish
what
are
you
going
to
do
kill
the
man
leave
me
alone
wilson
let
go
during
the
brief
struggle
between
sholmes
and
wilson
the
stranger
rode
away
now
you
can
shoot
said
wilson
triumphantly
when
the
horseman
was
at
some
distance
wilson
you
an
idiot
do
you
understand
that
the
man
is
an
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
sholmes
was
trembling
from
rage
wilson
stammered
pitifully
what
that
man
an
accomplice
yes
the
same
as
the
workmen
who
tried
to
drop
the
bag
of
sand
on
us
yesterday
it
ca
be
possible
possible
or
not
there
was
only
one
way
to
prove
it
by
killing
the
man
no
by
killing
the
horse
if
you
had
grabbed
my
arm
i
should
have
captured
one
of
lupin
accomplices
now
do
you
understand
the
folly
of
your
act
throughout
the
afternoon
both
men
were
morose
they
did
not
speak
a
word
to
each
other
at
five
they
visited
the
rue
clapeyron
but
were
careful
to
keep
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
houses
however
three
young
men
who
were
passing
through
the
street
arm
in
arm
singing
ran
against
sholmes
and
wilson
and
refused
to
let
them
pass
sholmes
who
was
in
an
ill
humor
contested
the
right
of
way
with
them
after
a
brief
struggle
sholmes
resorted
to
his
fists
he
struck
one
of
the
men
a
hard
blow
on
the
chest
another
a
blow
in
the
face
and
thus
subdued
two
of
his
adversaries
thereupon
the
three
of
them
took
to
their
heels
and
disappeared
ah
exclaimed
sholmes
that
does
me
good
i
needed
a
little
exercise
but
wilson
was
leaning
against
the
wall
sholmes
said
what
the
matter
old
chap
you
quite
pale
wilson
pointed
to
his
left
arm
which
hung
inert
and
stammered
i
do
know
what
it
is
my
arm
pains
me
very
much
is
it
serious
yes
i
am
afraid
so
he
tried
to
raise
his
arm
but
it
was
helpless
sholmes
felt
it
gently
at
first
then
in
a
rougher
way
to
see
how
badly
it
was
hurt
he
said
he
concluded
that
wilson
was
really
hurt
so
he
led
him
to
a
neighboring
pharmacy
where
a
closer
examination
revealed
the
fact
that
the
arm
was
broken
and
that
wilson
was
a
candidate
for
the
hospital
in
the
meantime
they
bared
his
arm
and
applied
some
remedies
to
ease
his
suffering
come
come
old
chap
cheer
up
said
sholmes
who
was
holding
arm
in
five
or
six
weeks
you
will
be
all
right
again
but
i
will
pay
them
back
the
rascals
especially
lupin
for
this
is
his
work
no
doubt
of
that
i
swear
to
you
if
ever
he
stopped
suddenly
dropped
the
arm
which
caused
wilson
such
an
access
of
pain
that
he
almost
fainted
and
striking
his
forehead
sholmes
said
wilson
i
have
an
idea
you
know
i
have
one
occasionally
he
stood
for
a
moment
silent
with
staring
eyes
and
then
muttered
in
short
sharp
phrases
yes
that
it
that
will
explain
all
right
at
my
feet
and
i
did
see
it
ah
parbleu
i
should
have
thought
of
it
before
wilson
i
shall
have
good
news
for
you
abruptly
leaving
his
old
friend
sholmes
ran
into
the
street
and
went
directly
to
the
house
known
as
number
on
one
of
the
stones
to
the
right
of
the
door
he
read
this
inscription
destange
architect
there
was
a
similar
inscription
on
the
house
numbered
of
course
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
that
but
what
might
be
read
on
the
houses
in
the
avenue
a
carriage
was
passing
he
engaged
it
and
directed
the
driver
to
take
him
to
no
avenue
he
was
roused
to
a
high
pitch
of
excitement
he
stood
up
in
the
carriage
and
urged
the
horse
to
greater
speed
he
offered
extra
pourboires
to
the
driver
quicker
quicker
how
great
was
his
anxiety
as
they
turned
from
the
rue
de
la
pompe
had
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
truth
at
last
on
one
of
the
stones
of
the
late
baron
house
he
read
the
words
destange
architect
and
a
similar
inscription
appeared
on
the
two
adjoining
houses
the
reaction
was
such
that
he
settled
down
in
the
seat
of
the
carriage
trembling
from
joy
at
last
a
tiny
ray
of
light
had
penetrated
the
dark
shadows
which
encompassed
these
mysterious
crimes
in
the
vast
sombre
forest
wherein
a
thousand
pathways
crossed
and
he
had
discovered
the
first
clue
to
the
track
followed
by
the
enemy
he
entered
a
branch
postoffice
and
obtained
telephonic
connection
with
the
château
de
crozon
the
countess
answered
the
telephone
call
hello
is
that
you
madame
monsieur
sholmes
is
it
everything
going
all
right
quite
well
but
i
wish
to
ask
you
one
question
hello
yes
i
hear
you
tell
me
when
was
the
château
de
crozon
built
it
was
destroyed
by
fire
and
rebuilt
about
thirty
years
ago
who
built
it
and
in
what
year
there
is
an
inscription
on
the
front
of
the
house
which
reads
destange
architect
thank
you
madame
that
is
all
he
went
away
murmuring
destange
lucien
destange
that
name
has
a
familiar
sound
he
noticed
a
public
entered
consulted
a
dictionary
of
modern
biography
and
copied
the
following
information
lucien
destange
born
de
rome
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
author
of
several
valuable
books
on
architecture
etc
then
he
returned
to
the
pharmacy
and
found
that
wilson
had
been
taken
to
the
hospital
there
sholmes
found
him
with
his
arm
in
splints
and
shivering
with
fever
victory
victory
cried
sholmes
i
hold
one
end
of
the
thread
of
what
thread
the
one
that
leads
to
victory
i
shall
now
be
walking
on
solid
ground
where
there
will
be
footprints
clues
cigarette
ashes
asked
wilson
whose
curiosity
had
overcome
his
pain
and
many
other
things
just
think
wilson
i
have
found
the
mysterious
link
which
unites
the
different
adventures
in
which
the
blonde
lady
played
a
part
why
did
lupin
select
those
three
houses
for
the
scenes
of
his
exploits
yes
why
because
those
three
houses
were
built
by
the
same
architect
that
was
an
easy
problem
eh
of
course
but
who
would
have
thought
of
it
no
one
but
you
and
who
except
i
knows
that
the
same
architect
by
the
use
of
analogous
plans
has
rendered
it
possible
for
a
person
to
execute
three
distinct
acts
which
though
miraculous
in
appearance
are
in
reality
quite
simple
and
easy
that
was
a
stroke
of
good
luck
and
it
was
time
dear
boy
as
i
was
becoming
very
impatient
you
know
this
is
our
fourth
day
out
of
ten
oh
after
this
sholmes
was
excited
delighted
and
gayer
than
usual
and
when
i
think
that
these
rascals
might
have
attacked
me
in
the
street
and
broken
my
arm
just
as
they
did
yours
is
that
so
wilson
wilson
simply
shivered
at
the
horrible
thought
sholmes
continued
we
must
profit
by
the
lesson
i
can
see
wilson
that
we
were
wrong
to
try
and
fight
lupin
in
the
open
and
leave
ourselves
exposed
to
his
attacks
i
can
see
it
and
feel
it
too
in
my
broken
arm
said
wilson
you
have
one
consolation
wilson
that
is
that
i
escaped
now
i
must
be
doubly
cautious
in
an
open
fight
he
will
defeat
me
but
if
i
can
work
in
the
dark
unseen
by
him
i
have
the
advantage
no
matter
how
strong
his
forces
may
be
ganimard
might
be
of
some
assistance
never
on
the
day
that
i
can
truly
say
arsène
lupin
is
there
i
show
you
the
quarry
and
how
to
catch
it
i
shall
go
and
see
ganimard
at
one
of
the
two
addresses
that
he
gave
me
his
residence
in
the
rue
pergolese
or
at
the
suisse
tavern
in
the
place
du
châtelet
but
until
that
time
i
shall
work
alone
he
approached
the
bed
placed
his
hand
on
wilson
shoulder
on
the
sore
one
of
course
and
said
to
him
take
care
of
yourself
old
fellow
henceforth
your
rôle
will
be
to
keep
two
or
three
of
arsène
lupin
men
busy
watching
here
in
vain
for
my
return
to
enquire
about
your
health
it
is
a
secret
mission
for
you
eh
yes
and
i
shall
do
my
best
to
fulfil
it
conscientiously
then
you
do
not
expect
to
come
here
any
more
what
for
asked
sholmes
i
do
know
of
course
i
am
getting
on
as
well
as
possible
but
herlock
do
me
a
last
service
give
me
a
drink
a
drink
yes
i
am
dying
of
thirst
and
with
my
fever
to
be
sure
directly
he
made
a
pretense
of
getting
some
water
perceived
a
package
of
tobacco
lighted
his
pipe
and
then
as
if
he
had
not
heard
his
request
he
went
away
whilst
wilson
uttered
a
mute
prayer
for
the
inaccessible
water
monsieur
destange
the
servant
eyed
from
head
to
foot
the
person
to
whom
he
had
opened
the
door
of
the
house
the
magnificent
house
that
stood
at
the
corner
of
the
place
malesherbes
and
the
rue
montchanin
and
at
the
sight
of
the
man
with
gray
hairs
badly
shaved
dressed
in
a
shabby
black
coat
with
a
body
as
and
ungracious
as
his
face
he
replied
with
the
disdain
which
he
thought
the
occasion
warranted
monsieur
destange
may
or
may
not
be
at
home
that
depends
has
monsieur
a
card
monsieur
did
not
have
a
card
but
he
had
a
letter
of
introduction
and
after
the
servant
had
taken
the
letter
to
mon
destange
he
was
conducted
into
the
presence
of
that
gentleman
who
was
sitting
in
a
large
circular
room
or
rotunda
which
occupied
one
of
the
wings
of
the
house
it
was
a
library
and
contained
a
profusion
of
books
and
architectural
drawings
when
the
stranger
entered
the
architect
said
to
him
you
are
monsieur
stickmann
yes
monsieur
my
secretary
tells
me
that
he
is
ill
and
has
sent
you
to
continue
the
general
catalogue
of
the
books
which
he
commenced
under
my
direction
and
more
particularly
the
catalogue
of
german
books
are
you
familiar
with
that
kind
of
work
yes
monsieur
quite
so
he
replied
with
a
strong
german
accent
under
those
circumstances
the
bargain
was
soon
concluded
and
mon
destange
commenced
work
with
his
new
secretary
herlock
sholmes
had
gained
access
to
the
house
in
order
to
escape
the
vigilance
of
arsène
lupin
and
gain
admittance
to
the
house
occupied
by
lucien
destange
and
his
daughter
clotilde
the
famous
detective
had
been
compelled
to
resort
to
a
number
of
stratagems
and
under
a
variety
of
names
to
ingratiate
himself
into
the
good
graces
and
confidence
of
a
number
of
persons
in
short
to
live
during
hours
a
most
complicated
life
during
that
time
he
had
acquired
the
following
information
mon
destange
having
retired
from
active
business
on
account
of
his
failing
health
now
lived
amongst
the
many
books
he
had
accumulated
on
the
subject
of
architecture
he
derived
infinite
pleasure
in
viewing
and
handling
those
dusty
old
volumes
his
daughter
clotilde
was
considered
eccentric
she
passed
her
time
in
another
part
of
the
house
and
never
went
out
of
course
sholmes
said
to
himself
as
he
wrote
in
a
register
the
titles
of
the
books
which
mon
destange
dictated
to
him
all
that
is
vague
and
incomplete
but
it
is
quite
a
long
step
in
advance
i
shall
surely
solve
one
of
these
absorbing
problems
is
mon
destange
associated
with
arsène
lupin
does
he
continue
to
see
him
are
the
papers
relating
to
the
construction
of
the
three
houses
still
in
existence
will
those
papers
not
furnish
me
with
the
location
of
other
houses
of
similar
construction
which
arsène
lupin
and
his
associates
will
plunder
in
the
future
monsieur
destange
an
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
that
venerable
man
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
working
in
league
with
a
burglar
such
an
idea
was
absurd
besides
if
we
concede
that
such
a
complicity
exists
how
could
mon
destange
thirty
years
ago
have
possibly
foreseen
the
thefts
of
arsène
lupin
who
was
then
an
infant
no
matter
the
englishman
was
implacable
with
his
marvellous
scent
and
that
instinct
which
never
fails
him
he
felt
that
he
was
in
the
heart
of
some
strange
mystery
ever
since
he
first
entered
the
house
he
had
been
under
the
influence
of
that
impression
and
yet
he
could
not
define
the
grounds
on
which
he
based
his
suspicions
up
to
the
morning
of
the
second
day
he
had
not
made
any
significant
discovery
at
two
of
that
day
he
saw
clotilde
destange
for
the
first
time
she
came
to
the
library
in
search
of
a
book
she
was
about
thirty
years
of
age
a
brunette
slow
and
silent
in
her
movements
with
features
imbued
with
that
expression
of
indifference
which
is
characteristic
of
people
who
live
a
secluded
life
she
exchanged
a
few
words
with
her
father
and
then
retired
without
even
looking
at
sholmes
the
afternoon
dragged
along
monotonously
at
five
mon
destange
announced
his
intention
to
go
out
sholmes
was
alone
on
the
circular
gallery
that
was
constructed
about
ten
feet
above
the
floor
of
the
rotunda
it
was
almost
dark
he
was
on
the
point
of
going
out
when
he
heard
a
slight
sound
and
at
the
same
time
experienced
the
feeling
that
there
was
someone
in
the
room
several
minutes
passed
before
he
saw
or
heard
anything
more
then
he
shuddered
a
shadowy
form
emerged
from
the
gloom
quite
close
to
him
upon
the
balcony
it
seemed
incredible
how
long
had
this
mysterious
visitor
been
there
whence
did
he
come
the
strange
man
descended
the
steps
and
went
directly
to
a
large
oaken
cupboard
sholmes
was
a
keen
observer
of
the
man
movements
he
watched
him
searching
amongst
the
papers
with
which
the
cupboard
was
filled
what
was
he
looking
for
then
the
door
opened
and
mlle
destange
entered
speaking
to
someone
who
was
following
her
so
you
have
decided
not
to
go
out
father
then
i
will
make
a
light
one
second
do
not
move
the
strange
man
closed
the
cupboard
and
hid
in
the
embrasure
of
a
large
window
drawing
the
curtains
together
did
mlle
destange
not
see
him
did
she
not
hear
him
calmly
she
turned
on
the
electric
lights
she
and
her
father
sat
down
close
to
each
other
she
opened
a
book
she
had
brought
with
her
and
commenced
to
read
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
she
said
your
secretary
has
gone
yes
i
do
see
him
do
you
like
him
as
well
as
you
did
at
first
she
asked
as
if
she
were
not
aware
of
the
illness
of
the
real
secretary
and
his
replacement
by
stickmann
oh
yes
monsieur
destange
head
bobbed
from
one
side
to
the
other
he
was
asleep
the
girl
resumed
her
reading
a
moment
later
one
of
the
window
curtains
was
pushed
back
and
the
strange
man
emerged
and
glided
along
the
wall
toward
the
door
which
obliged
him
to
pass
behind
mon
destange
but
in
front
of
clotilde
and
brought
him
into
the
light
so
that
herlock
sholmes
obtained
a
good
view
of
the
man
face
it
was
arsène
lupin
the
englishman
was
delighted
his
forecast
was
verified
he
had
penetrated
to
the
very
heart
of
the
mystery
and
found
arsène
lupin
to
be
the
moving
spirit
in
it
clotilde
had
not
yet
displayed
any
knowledge
of
his
presence
although
it
was
quite
improbable
that
any
movement
of
the
intruder
had
escaped
her
notice
lupin
had
almost
reached
the
door
and
in
fact
his
hand
was
already
seeking
the
when
his
coat
brushed
against
a
small
table
and
knocked
something
to
the
floor
monsieur
destange
awoke
with
a
start
arsène
lupin
was
already
standing
in
front
of
him
hat
in
hand
smiling
maxime
bermond
exclaimed
mon
destange
joyfully
my
dear
maxime
what
lucky
chance
brings
you
here
the
wish
to
see
you
and
mademoiselle
destange
when
did
you
return
from
your
journey
yesterday
you
must
stay
to
dinner
no
thank
you
i
am
sorry
but
i
have
an
appointment
to
dine
with
some
friends
at
a
restaurant
come
then
clotilde
you
must
urge
him
to
come
ah
my
dear
maxime
i
thought
of
you
many
times
during
your
absence
really
yes
i
went
through
all
my
old
papers
in
that
cupboard
and
found
our
last
statement
of
account
what
account
relating
to
the
avenue
ah
do
you
keep
such
papers
what
for
then
the
three
of
them
left
the
room
and
continued
their
conversation
in
a
small
parlor
which
adjoined
the
library
is
it
lupin
sholmes
asked
himself
in
a
sudden
access
of
doubt
certainly
from
all
appearances
it
was
he
and
yet
it
was
also
someone
else
who
resembled
arsène
lupin
in
certain
respects
and
who
still
maintained
his
own
individuality
features
and
color
of
hair
sholmes
could
hear
lupin
voice
in
the
adjoining
room
he
was
relating
some
stories
at
which
mon
destange
laughed
heartily
and
which
even
brought
a
smile
to
the
lips
of
the
melancholy
clotilde
and
each
of
those
smiles
appeared
to
be
the
reward
which
arsène
lupin
was
seeking
and
which
he
was
delighted
to
have
secured
his
success
caused
him
to
redouble
his
efforts
and
insensibly
at
the
sound
of
that
clear
and
happy
voice
clotilde
face
brightened
and
lost
that
cold
and
listless
expression
which
usually
pervaded
it
they
love
each
other
thought
sholmes
but
what
the
deuce
can
there
be
in
common
between
clotilde
destange
and
maxime
bermond
does
she
know
that
maxime
is
none
other
than
arsène
lupin
until
seven
sholmes
was
an
anxious
listener
seeking
to
profit
by
the
conversation
then
with
infinite
precaution
he
descended
from
the
gallery
crept
along
the
side
of
the
room
to
the
door
in
such
a
manner
that
the
people
in
the
adjoining
room
did
not
see
him
when
he
reached
the
street
sholmes
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
neither
an
automobile
nor
a
cab
waiting
there
then
he
slowly
limped
along
the
boulevard
malesherbes
he
turned
into
an
adjacent
street
donned
the
overcoat
which
he
had
carried
on
his
arm
altered
the
shape
of
his
hat
assumed
an
upright
carriage
and
thus
transformed
returned
to
a
place
whence
he
could
watch
the
door
of
mon
house
in
a
few
minutes
arsène
lupin
came
out
and
proceeded
to
walk
toward
the
center
of
paris
by
way
of
the
rues
de
constantinople
and
london
herlock
sholmes
followed
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
paces
exciting
moments
for
the
englishman
he
sniffed
the
air
eagerly
like
a
hound
following
a
fresh
scent
it
seemed
to
him
a
delightful
thing
thus
to
follow
his
adversary
it
was
no
longer
herlock
sholmes
who
was
being
watched
but
arsène
lupin
the
invisible
arsène
lupin
he
held
him
so
to
speak
within
the
grasp
of
his
eye
by
an
imperceptible
bond
that
nothing
could
break
and
he
was
pleased
to
think
that
the
quarry
belonged
to
him
but
he
soon
observed
a
suspicious
circumstance
in
the
intervening
space
between
him
and
arsène
lupin
he
noticed
several
people
traveling
in
the
same
direction
particularly
two
husky
fellows
in
slouch
hats
on
the
left
side
of
the
street
and
two
others
on
the
right
wearing
caps
and
smoking
cigarettes
of
course
their
presence
in
that
vicinity
may
have
been
the
result
of
chance
but
sholmes
was
more
astonished
when
he
observed
that
the
four
men
stopped
when
lupin
entered
a
tobacco
shop
and
still
more
surprised
when
the
four
men
started
again
after
lupin
emerged
from
the
shop
each
keeping
to
his
own
side
of
the
street
curse
it
muttered
sholmes
he
is
being
followed
he
was
annoyed
at
the
idea
that
others
were
on
the
trail
of
arsène
lupin
that
someone
might
deprive
him
not
of
the
glory
he
cared
little
for
that
but
of
the
immense
pleasure
of
capturing
the
most
formidable
enemy
he
had
ever
met
and
he
felt
that
he
was
not
mistaken
the
men
presented
to
sholmes
experienced
eye
the
appearance
and
manner
of
those
who
while
regulating
their
gait
to
that
of
another
wish
to
present
a
careless
and
natural
air
is
this
some
of
ganimard
work
muttered
sholmes
is
he
playing
me
false
he
felt
inclined
to
speak
to
one
of
the
men
with
a
view
of
acting
in
concert
with
him
but
as
they
were
now
approaching
the
boulevard
the
crowd
was
becoming
denser
and
he
was
afraid
he
might
lose
sight
of
lupin
so
he
quickened
his
pace
and
turned
into
the
boulevard
just
in
time
to
see
lupin
ascending
the
steps
of
the
hungarian
restaurant
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
du
helder
the
door
of
the
restaurant
was
open
so
that
sholmes
while
sitting
on
a
bench
on
the
other
side
of
the
boulevard
could
see
lupin
take
a
seat
at
a
table
luxuriously
appointed
and
decorated
with
flowers
at
which
three
gentlemen
and
two
ladies
of
elegant
appearance
were
already
seated
and
who
extended
to
lupin
a
hearty
greeting
sholmes
now
looked
about
for
the
four
men
and
perceived
them
amongst
a
crowd
of
people
who
were
listening
to
a
gipsy
orchestra
that
was
playing
in
a
neighboring
café
it
was
a
curious
thing
that
they
were
paying
no
attention
to
arsène
lupin
but
seemed
to
be
friendly
with
the
people
around
them
one
of
them
took
a
cigarette
from
his
pocket
and
approached
a
gentleman
who
wore
a
frock
coat
and
silk
hat
the
gentleman
offered
the
other
his
cigar
for
a
light
and
sholmes
had
the
impression
that
they
talked
to
each
other
much
longer
than
the
occasion
demanded
finally
the
gentleman
approached
the
hungarian
restaurant
entered
and
looked
around
when
he
caught
sight
of
lupin
he
advanced
and
spoke
to
him
for
a
moment
then
took
a
seat
at
an
adjoining
table
sholmes
now
recognized
this
gentleman
as
the
horseman
who
had
tried
to
run
him
down
in
the
avenue
then
sholmes
understood
that
these
men
were
not
tracking
arsène
lupin
they
were
a
part
of
his
band
they
were
watching
over
his
safety
they
were
his
bodyguard
his
satellites
his
vigilant
escort
wherever
danger
threatened
lupin
these
confederates
were
at
hand
to
avert
it
ready
to
defend
him
the
four
men
were
accomplices
the
gentleman
in
the
frock
coat
was
an
accomplice
these
facts
furnished
the
englishman
with
food
for
reflection
would
he
ever
succeed
in
capturing
that
inaccessible
individual
what
unlimited
power
was
possessed
by
such
an
organization
directed
by
such
a
chief
he
tore
a
leaf
from
his
notebook
wrote
a
few
lines
in
pencil
which
he
placed
in
an
envelope
and
said
to
a
boy
about
fifteen
years
of
age
who
was
sitting
on
the
bench
beside
him
here
my
boy
take
a
carriage
and
deliver
this
letter
to
the
cashier
of
the
suisse
tavern
place
du
châtelet
be
quick
he
gave
him
a
piece
the
boy
disappeared
a
half
hour
passed
away
the
crowd
had
grown
larger
and
sholmes
perceived
only
at
intervals
the
accomplices
of
arsène
lupin
then
someone
brushed
against
him
and
whispered
in
his
ear
well
what
is
it
monsieur
sholmes
ah
it
is
you
ganimard
yes
i
received
your
note
at
the
tavern
what
the
matter
he
is
there
what
do
you
mean
there
in
the
restaurant
lean
to
the
right
do
you
see
him
now
no
he
is
pouring
a
glass
of
champagne
for
the
lady
that
is
not
lupin
yes
it
is
but
i
tell
you
ah
yet
it
may
be
it
looks
a
great
deal
like
him
said
ganimard
naively
and
the
others
accomplices
no
the
lady
sitting
beside
him
is
lady
cliveden
the
other
is
the
duchess
de
cleath
the
gentleman
sitting
opposite
lupin
is
the
spanish
ambassador
to
london
ganimard
took
a
step
forward
sholmes
retained
him
be
prudent
you
are
alone
so
is
he
no
he
has
a
number
of
men
on
the
boulevard
mounting
guard
and
inside
the
restaurant
that
gentleman
and
i
when
i
take
arsène
lupin
by
the
collar
and
announce
his
name
i
shall
have
the
entire
room
on
my
side
and
all
the
waiters
i
should
prefer
to
have
a
few
policemen
but
monsieur
sholmes
we
have
no
choice
we
must
catch
him
when
we
can
he
was
right
sholmes
knew
it
it
was
better
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
make
the
attempt
sholmes
simply
gave
this
advice
to
ganimard
conceal
your
identity
as
long
as
possible
sholmes
glided
behind
a
newspaper
kiosk
whence
he
could
still
watch
lupin
who
was
leaning
toward
lady
cliveden
talking
and
smiling
ganimard
crossed
the
street
hands
in
his
pockets
as
if
he
were
going
down
the
boulevard
but
when
he
reached
the
opposite
sidewalk
he
turned
quickly
and
bounded
up
the
steps
of
the
restaurant
there
was
a
shrill
whistle
ganimard
ran
against
the
head
waiter
who
had
suddenly
planted
himself
in
the
doorway
and
now
pushed
ganimard
back
with
a
show
of
indignation
as
if
he
were
an
intruder
whose
presence
would
bring
disgrace
upon
the
restaurant
ganimard
was
surprised
at
the
same
moment
the
gentleman
in
the
frock
coat
came
out
he
took
the
part
of
the
detective
and
entered
into
an
exciting
argument
with
the
waiter
both
of
them
hung
on
to
ganimard
one
pushing
him
in
the
other
pushing
him
out
in
such
a
manner
that
despite
all
his
efforts
and
despite
his
furious
protestations
the
unfortunate
detective
soon
found
himself
on
the
sidewalk
the
struggling
men
were
surrounded
by
a
crowd
two
policemen
attracted
by
the
noise
tried
to
force
their
way
through
the
crowd
but
encountered
a
mysterious
resistance
and
could
make
no
headway
through
the
opposing
backs
and
pressing
shoulders
of
the
mob
but
suddenly
as
if
by
magic
the
crowd
parted
and
the
passage
to
the
restaurant
was
clear
the
head
waiter
recognizing
his
mistake
was
profuse
in
his
apologies
the
gentleman
in
the
frock
coat
ceased
his
efforts
on
behalf
of
the
detective
the
crowd
dispersed
the
policemen
passed
on
and
ganimard
hastened
to
the
table
at
which
the
six
guests
were
sitting
but
now
there
were
only
five
he
looked
around
the
only
exit
was
the
door
the
person
who
was
sitting
here
he
cried
to
the
five
astonished
guests
where
is
he
monsieur
destro
no
arsène
lupin
a
waiter
approached
and
said
the
gentleman
went
upstairs
ganimard
rushed
up
in
the
hope
of
finding
him
the
upper
floor
of
the
restaurant
contained
private
and
had
a
private
stairway
leading
to
the
boulevard
no
use
looking
for
him
now
muttered
ganimard
he
is
far
away
by
this
time
he
was
not
far
away
two
hundred
yards
at
most
in
the
omnibus
which
was
rolling
along
very
peacefully
with
its
three
horses
across
the
place
de
toward
the
boulevard
des
capucines
two
sturdy
fellows
were
talking
together
on
the
platform
on
the
roof
of
the
omnibus
near
the
stairs
an
old
fellow
was
sleeping
it
was
herlock
sholmes
with
bobbing
head
rocked
by
the
movement
of
the
vehicle
the
englishman
said
to
himself
if
wilson
could
see
me
now
how
proud
he
would
be
of
his
collaborator
bah
it
was
easy
to
foresee
that
the
game
was
lost
as
soon
as
the
man
whistled
nothing
could
be
done
but
watch
the
exits
and
see
that
our
man
did
not
escape
really
lupin
makes
life
exciting
and
interesting
at
the
terminal
point
herlock
sholmes
by
leaning
over
saw
arsène
lupin
leaving
the
omnibus
and
as
he
passed
in
front
of
the
men
who
formed
his
bodyguard
sholmes
heard
him
say
a
a
exactly
a
rendezvous
i
shall
be
there
thought
sholmes
i
will
follow
the
two
men
lupin
took
an
automobile
but
the
men
walked
the
entire
distance
followed
by
sholmes
they
stopped
at
a
narrow
house
no
rue
chalgrin
and
rang
the
bell
sholmes
took
his
position
in
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
whence
he
could
watch
the
house
in
question
a
man
opened
one
of
the
windows
of
the
ground
floor
and
closed
the
shutters
but
the
shutters
did
not
reach
to
the
top
of
the
window
the
impost
was
clear
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
a
gentleman
rang
at
the
same
door
and
a
few
minutes
later
another
man
came
a
short
time
afterward
an
automobile
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
bringing
two
passengers
arsène
lupin
and
a
lady
concealed
beneath
a
large
cloak
and
a
thick
veil
the
blonde
lady
no
doubt
said
sholmes
to
himself
as
the
automobile
drove
away
herlock
sholmes
now
approached
the
house
climbed
to
the
and
by
standing
on
tiptoe
he
was
able
to
see
through
the
window
above
the
shutters
what
did
he
see
arsène
lupin
leaning
against
the
mantel
was
speaking
with
considerable
animation
the
others
were
grouped
around
him
listening
to
him
attentively
amongst
them
sholmes
easily
recognized
the
gentleman
in
the
frock
coat
and
he
thought
one
of
the
other
men
resembled
the
of
the
restaurant
as
to
the
blonde
lady
she
was
seated
in
an
armchair
with
her
back
to
the
window
they
are
holding
a
consultation
thought
sholmes
they
are
worried
over
the
incident
at
the
restaurant
and
are
holding
a
council
of
war
ah
what
a
master
stroke
it
would
be
to
capture
all
of
them
at
one
fell
stroke
one
of
them
having
moved
toward
the
door
sholmes
leaped
to
the
ground
and
concealed
himself
in
the
shadow
the
gentleman
in
the
frock
coat
and
the
left
the
house
a
moment
later
a
light
appeared
at
the
windows
of
the
first
floor
but
the
shutters
were
closed
immediately
and
the
upper
part
of
the
house
was
dark
as
well
as
the
lower
lupin
and
the
woman
are
on
the
ground
floor
the
two
confederates
live
on
the
upper
floor
said
sholmes
sholmes
remained
there
the
greater
part
of
the
night
fearing
that
if
he
went
away
arsène
lupin
might
leave
during
his
absence
at
four
seeing
two
policemen
at
the
end
of
the
street
he
approached
them
explained
the
situation
and
left
them
to
watch
the
house
he
went
to
ganimard
residence
in
the
rue
pergolese
and
wakened
him
i
have
him
yet
said
sholmes
arsène
lupin
yes
if
you
have
got
any
better
hold
on
him
than
you
had
a
while
ago
i
might
as
well
go
back
to
bed
but
we
may
as
well
go
to
the
they
went
to
the
police
station
in
the
rue
mesnil
and
from
there
to
the
residence
of
the
commissary
mon
decointre
then
accompanied
by
half
a
dozen
policemen
they
went
to
the
rue
chalgrin
anything
new
asked
sholmes
addressing
the
two
policemen
nothing
it
was
just
breaking
day
when
after
taking
necessary
measures
to
prevent
escape
the
commissary
rang
the
bell
and
commenced
to
question
the
concierge
the
woman
was
greatly
frightened
at
this
early
morning
invasion
and
she
trembled
as
she
replied
that
there
were
no
tenants
on
the
ground
floor
what
not
a
tenant
exclaimed
ganimard
no
but
on
the
first
floor
there
are
two
men
named
leroux
they
have
furnished
the
apartment
on
the
ground
floor
for
some
country
relations
a
gentleman
and
lady
yes
who
came
here
last
night
perhaps
but
i
do
know
i
was
asleep
but
i
do
think
so
for
the
key
is
here
they
did
not
ask
for
it
with
that
key
the
commissary
opened
the
door
of
the
apartment
it
comprised
only
two
rooms
and
they
were
empty
impossible
exclaimed
sholmes
i
saw
both
of
them
in
this
room
i
do
doubt
your
word
said
the
commissary
but
they
are
not
here
now
let
us
go
to
the
first
floor
they
must
be
there
the
first
floor
is
occupied
by
two
men
named
leroux
we
will
examine
the
messieurs
leroux
they
all
ascended
the
stairs
and
the
commissary
rang
at
the
second
ring
a
man
opened
the
door
he
was
in
his
sholmes
recognized
him
as
one
of
lupin
bodyguard
the
man
assumed
a
furious
air
what
do
you
mean
by
making
such
a
row
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
waking
people
up
but
he
stopped
suddenly
astounded
god
forgive
me
really
gentlemen
i
did
notice
who
it
was
why
it
is
monsieur
decointre
and
you
monsieur
ganimard
what
can
i
do
for
you
ganimard
burst
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
which
caused
him
to
bend
double
and
turn
black
in
the
face
ah
it
is
you
leroux
he
stammered
oh
this
is
too
funny
leroux
an
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
oh
i
shall
die
and
your
brother
leroux
where
is
he
edmond
called
the
man
it
is
ganimard
who
has
come
to
visit
us
another
man
appeared
and
at
sight
of
him
ganimard
mirth
redoubled
oh
oh
we
had
no
idea
of
this
ah
my
friends
you
are
in
a
bad
fix
now
who
would
have
ever
suspected
it
turning
to
sholmes
ganimard
introduced
the
man
victor
leroux
a
detective
from
our
office
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
iron
brigade
edmond
leroux
chief
clerk
in
the
anthropometric
service
chapter
an
abduction
herlock
sholmes
said
nothing
to
protest
to
accuse
the
two
men
that
would
be
useless
in
the
absence
of
evidence
which
he
did
not
possess
and
had
no
time
to
seek
no
one
would
believe
him
moreover
he
was
stifled
with
rage
but
would
not
display
his
feelings
before
the
triumphant
ganimard
so
he
bowed
respectfully
to
the
brothers
leroux
guardians
of
society
and
retired
in
the
vestibule
he
turned
toward
a
low
door
which
looked
like
the
entrance
to
a
cellar
and
picked
up
a
small
red
stone
it
was
a
garnet
when
he
reached
the
street
he
turned
and
read
on
the
front
of
the
house
this
inscription
lucien
destange
architect
the
adjoining
house
no
bore
the
same
inscription
always
the
double
passage
numbers
and
have
a
secret
means
of
communication
why
did
i
think
of
that
i
should
have
remained
with
the
two
policemen
he
met
the
policemen
near
the
corner
and
said
to
them
two
people
came
out
of
house
no
during
my
absence
did
they
yes
a
gentleman
and
lady
ganimard
approached
sholmes
took
his
arm
and
as
they
walked
down
the
street
he
said
monsieur
ganimard
you
have
had
a
good
laugh
and
will
no
doubt
forgive
me
for
the
trouble
i
have
caused
you
oh
there
no
harm
done
but
it
was
a
good
joke
i
admit
that
but
the
best
jokes
have
only
a
short
life
and
this
one
ca
last
much
longer
i
hope
not
this
is
now
the
seventh
day
and
i
can
remain
only
three
days
more
then
i
must
return
to
london
oh
i
wish
to
ask
you
to
be
in
readiness
as
i
may
call
on
you
at
any
hour
on
tuesday
or
wednesday
night
for
an
expedition
of
the
same
kind
as
we
had
yes
monsieur
the
very
same
with
what
result
the
capture
of
arsène
lupin
replied
sholmes
do
you
think
so
i
swear
it
on
my
honor
monsieur
sholmes
bade
ganimard
and
went
to
the
nearest
hotel
for
a
few
hours
sleep
after
which
refreshed
and
with
renewed
confidence
in
himself
he
returned
to
the
rue
chalgrin
slipped
two
louis
into
the
hand
of
the
concierge
assured
himself
that
the
brothers
leroux
had
gone
out
learned
that
the
house
belonged
to
a
monsieur
harmingeat
and
provided
with
a
candle
descended
to
the
cellar
through
the
low
door
near
which
he
had
found
the
garnet
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
he
found
another
exactly
like
it
i
am
not
mistaken
he
thought
this
is
the
means
of
communication
let
me
see
if
my
will
open
the
cellar
reserved
for
the
tenant
of
the
ground
floor
yes
it
will
now
i
will
examine
those
cases
of
wine
oh
oh
here
are
some
places
where
the
dust
has
been
cleared
away
and
some
footprints
on
the
ground
a
slight
noise
caused
him
to
listen
attentively
quickly
he
pushed
the
door
shut
blew
out
his
candle
and
hid
behind
a
pile
of
empty
wine
cases
after
a
few
seconds
he
noticed
that
a
portion
of
the
wall
swung
on
a
pivot
the
light
of
a
lantern
was
thrown
into
the
cellar
an
arm
appeared
then
a
man
entered
he
was
bent
over
as
if
he
were
searching
for
something
he
felt
in
the
dust
with
his
fingers
and
several
times
he
threw
something
into
a
cardboard
box
that
he
carried
in
his
left
hand
afterward
he
obliterated
the
traces
of
his
footsteps
as
well
as
the
footprints
left
by
lupin
and
the
blonde
lady
and
he
was
about
to
leave
the
cellar
by
the
same
way
as
he
had
entered
when
he
uttered
a
harsh
cry
and
fell
to
the
ground
sholmes
had
leaped
upon
him
it
was
the
work
of
a
moment
and
in
the
simplest
manner
in
the
world
the
man
found
himself
stretched
on
the
ground
bound
and
handcuffed
the
englishman
leaned
over
him
and
said
have
you
anything
to
say
to
tell
what
you
know
the
man
replied
by
such
an
ironical
smile
that
sholmes
realized
the
futility
of
questioning
him
so
he
contented
himself
by
exploring
the
pockets
of
his
captive
but
he
found
only
a
bunch
of
keys
a
handkerchief
and
the
small
cardboard
box
which
contained
a
dozen
garnets
similar
to
those
which
sholmes
had
found
then
what
was
he
to
do
with
the
man
wait
until
his
friends
came
to
his
help
and
deliver
all
of
them
to
the
police
what
good
would
that
do
what
advantage
would
that
give
him
over
lupin
he
hesitated
but
an
examination
of
the
box
decided
the
question
the
box
bore
this
name
and
address
leonard
jeweler
rue
de
la
paix
he
resolved
to
abandon
the
man
to
his
fate
he
locked
the
cellar
and
left
the
house
at
a
branch
postoffice
he
sent
a
telegram
to
monsieur
destange
saying
that
he
could
not
come
that
day
then
he
went
to
see
the
jeweler
and
handing
him
the
garnets
said
madame
sent
me
with
these
stones
she
wishes
to
have
them
reset
sholmes
had
struck
the
right
key
the
jeweler
replied
certainly
the
lady
telephoned
to
me
she
said
she
would
be
here
sholmes
established
himself
on
the
sidewalk
to
wait
for
the
lady
but
it
was
five
when
he
saw
a
lady
approach
and
enter
the
store
through
the
window
he
saw
her
place
on
the
counter
a
piece
of
antique
jewelry
set
with
garnets
she
went
away
almost
immediately
walking
quickly
and
passed
through
streets
that
were
unknown
to
the
englishman
as
it
was
now
almost
dark
he
walked
close
behind
her
and
followed
her
into
a
house
of
double
flats
and
therefore
occupied
by
numerous
tenants
at
the
second
floor
she
stopped
and
entered
two
minutes
later
the
englishman
commenced
to
try
the
keys
on
the
bunch
he
had
taken
from
the
man
in
the
rue
chalgrin
the
fourth
key
fitted
the
lock
notwithstanding
the
darkness
of
the
rooms
he
perceived
that
they
were
absolutely
empty
as
if
unoccupied
and
the
various
doors
were
standing
open
so
that
he
could
see
all
the
apartments
at
the
end
of
a
corridor
he
perceived
a
ray
of
light
and
by
approaching
on
tiptoe
and
looking
through
the
glass
door
he
saw
the
veiled
lady
who
had
removed
her
hat
and
dress
and
was
now
wearing
a
velvet
the
discarded
garments
were
lying
on
the
only
chair
in
the
room
and
a
lighted
lamp
stood
on
the
mantel
then
he
saw
her
approach
the
fireplace
and
press
what
appeared
to
be
the
button
of
an
electric
bell
immediately
the
panel
to
the
right
of
the
fireplace
moved
and
slowly
glided
behind
the
adjoining
panel
thus
disclosing
an
opening
large
enough
for
a
person
to
pass
through
the
lady
disappeared
through
this
opening
taking
the
lamp
with
her
the
operation
was
a
very
simple
one
sholmes
adopted
it
and
followed
the
lady
he
found
himself
in
total
darkness
and
immediately
he
felt
his
face
brushed
by
some
soft
articles
he
lighted
a
match
and
found
that
he
was
in
a
very
small
room
completely
filled
with
cloaks
and
dresses
suspended
on
hangers
he
picked
his
way
through
until
he
reached
a
door
that
was
draped
with
a
portiere
he
peeped
through
and
behold
the
blonde
lady
was
there
under
his
eyes
and
almost
within
reach
of
his
hand
she
extinguished
the
lamp
and
turned
on
the
electric
lights
then
for
the
first
time
herlock
sholmes
obtained
a
good
look
at
her
face
he
was
amazed
the
woman
whom
he
had
overtaken
after
so
much
trouble
and
after
so
many
tricks
and
manoeuvres
was
none
other
than
clotilde
destange
clotilde
destange
the
assassin
of
the
baron
and
the
thief
who
stole
the
blue
diamond
clotilde
destange
the
mysterious
friend
of
arsène
lupin
and
the
blonde
lady
yes
i
am
only
a
stupid
ass
thought
herlock
sholmes
at
that
moment
because
lupin
friend
was
a
blonde
and
clotilde
is
a
brunette
i
never
dreamed
that
they
were
the
same
person
but
how
could
the
blonde
lady
remain
a
blonde
after
the
murder
of
the
baron
and
the
theft
of
the
diamond
sholmes
could
see
a
portion
of
the
room
it
was
a
boudoir
furnished
with
the
most
delightful
luxury
and
exquisite
taste
and
adorned
with
beautiful
tapestries
and
costly
ornaments
a
mahogany
couch
upholstered
in
silk
was
located
on
the
side
of
the
room
opposite
the
door
at
which
sholmes
was
standing
clotilde
was
sitting
on
this
couch
motionless
her
face
covered
by
her
hands
then
he
perceived
that
she
was
weeping
great
tears
rolled
down
her
pale
cheeks
and
fell
drop
by
drop
on
the
velvet
corsage
the
tears
came
thick
and
fast
as
if
their
source
were
inexhaustible
a
door
silently
opened
behind
her
and
arsène
lupin
entered
he
looked
at
her
for
a
long
time
without
making
his
presence
known
then
he
approached
her
knelt
at
her
feet
pressed
her
head
to
his
breast
folded
her
in
his
arms
and
his
actions
indicated
an
infinite
measure
of
love
and
sympathy
for
a
time
not
a
word
was
uttered
but
her
tears
became
less
abundant
i
was
so
anxious
to
make
you
happy
he
murmured
i
am
happy
no
you
are
crying
your
tears
break
my
heart
clotilde
the
caressing
and
sympathetic
tone
of
his
voice
soothed
her
and
she
listened
to
him
with
an
eager
desire
for
hope
and
happiness
her
features
were
softened
by
a
smile
and
yet
how
sad
a
smile
he
continued
to
speak
in
a
tone
of
tender
entreaty
you
should
not
be
unhappy
clotilde
you
have
no
cause
to
be
she
displayed
her
delicate
white
hands
and
said
solemnly
yes
maxime
so
long
as
i
see
those
hands
i
shall
be
sad
why
they
are
stained
with
blood
hush
do
not
think
of
that
exclaimed
lupin
the
dead
is
past
and
gone
do
not
resurrect
it
and
he
kissed
the
long
delicate
hand
while
she
regarded
him
with
a
brighter
smile
as
if
each
kiss
effaced
a
portion
of
that
dreadful
memory
you
must
love
me
maxime
you
must
because
no
woman
will
ever
love
you
as
i
do
for
your
sake
i
have
done
many
things
not
at
your
order
or
request
but
in
obedience
to
your
secret
desires
i
have
done
things
at
which
my
will
and
conscience
revolted
but
there
was
some
unknown
power
that
i
could
not
resist
what
i
did
i
did
involuntarily
mechanically
because
it
helped
you
because
you
wished
it
and
i
am
ready
to
do
it
again
and
always
ah
clotilde
he
said
bitterly
why
did
i
draw
you
into
my
adventurous
life
i
should
have
remained
the
maxime
bermond
that
you
loved
five
years
ago
and
not
have
let
you
know
the
other
man
that
i
am
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
i
love
the
other
man
also
and
i
have
nothing
to
regret
yes
you
regret
your
past
life
the
free
and
happy
life
you
once
enjoyed
i
have
no
regrets
when
you
are
here
she
said
passionately
all
faults
and
crimes
disappear
when
i
see
you
when
you
are
away
i
may
suffer
and
weep
and
be
horrified
at
what
i
have
done
but
when
you
come
it
is
all
forgotten
your
love
wipes
it
all
away
and
i
am
happy
again
but
you
must
love
me
i
do
not
love
you
on
compulsion
clotilde
i
love
you
simply
because
i
love
you
are
you
sure
of
it
i
am
just
as
sure
of
my
own
love
as
i
am
of
yours
only
my
life
is
a
very
active
and
exciting
one
and
i
can
not
spend
as
much
time
with
you
as
i
would
like
just
now
what
is
it
some
new
danger
tell
me
oh
nothing
serious
only
only
what
she
asked
well
he
is
on
our
track
who
herlock
sholmes
yes
it
was
he
who
dragged
ganimard
into
that
affair
at
the
hungarian
restaurant
it
was
he
who
instructed
the
two
policemen
to
watch
the
house
in
the
rue
chalgrin
i
have
proof
of
it
ganimard
searched
the
house
this
morning
and
sholmes
was
with
him
besides
besides
what
well
there
is
another
thing
one
of
our
men
is
missing
who
jeanniot
the
concierge
yes
why
i
sent
him
to
the
rue
chalgrin
this
morning
to
pick
up
the
garnets
that
fell
out
of
my
brooch
there
is
no
doubt
then
that
sholmes
caught
him
no
the
garnets
were
delivered
to
the
jeweler
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
then
what
has
become
of
him
oh
maxime
i
am
afraid
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
but
i
confess
the
situation
is
very
serious
what
does
he
know
where
does
he
hide
himself
his
isolation
is
his
strong
card
i
can
not
reach
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
act
with
extreme
prudence
clotilde
some
time
ago
i
decided
to
change
my
residence
to
a
safer
place
and
sholmes
appearance
on
the
scene
has
prompted
me
to
do
so
at
once
when
a
man
like
that
is
on
your
track
you
must
be
prepared
for
the
worst
well
i
am
making
my
preparations
day
after
wednesday
i
shall
move
at
noon
it
will
be
finished
at
two
i
shall
leave
the
place
after
removing
the
last
trace
of
our
residence
there
which
will
be
no
small
matter
until
then
well
until
then
we
must
not
see
each
other
and
no
one
must
see
you
clotilde
do
not
go
out
i
have
no
fear
for
myself
but
i
have
for
you
that
englishman
can
not
possibly
reach
me
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
he
is
a
dangerous
man
yesterday
i
came
here
to
search
the
cupboard
that
contains
all
of
monsieur
destange
old
papers
and
records
there
is
danger
there
there
is
danger
everywhere
i
feel
that
he
is
watching
us
that
he
is
drawing
his
net
around
us
closer
and
closer
it
is
one
of
those
intuitions
which
never
deceive
me
in
that
case
maxime
go
and
think
no
more
of
my
tears
i
shall
be
brave
and
wait
patiently
until
the
danger
is
past
adieu
maxime
they
held
one
another
for
some
time
in
a
last
fond
embrace
and
it
was
she
that
gently
pushed
him
outside
sholmes
could
hear
the
sound
of
their
voices
in
the
distance
emboldened
by
the
necessities
of
the
situation
and
the
urgent
need
of
bringing
his
investigation
to
a
speedy
termination
sholmes
proceeded
to
make
an
examination
of
the
house
in
which
he
now
found
himself
he
passed
through
clotilde
boudoir
into
a
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
there
was
a
stairway
leading
to
the
lower
floor
he
was
about
to
descend
this
stairway
when
he
heard
voices
below
which
caused
him
to
change
his
route
he
followed
the
corridor
which
was
a
circular
one
and
discovered
another
stairway
which
he
descended
and
found
himself
amidst
surroundings
that
bore
a
familiar
appearance
he
passed
through
a
door
that
stood
partly
open
and
entered
a
large
circular
room
it
was
monsieur
destange
library
ah
splendid
he
exclaimed
now
i
understand
everything
the
boudoir
of
mademoiselle
clotilde
the
blonde
lady
communicates
with
a
room
in
the
adjoining
house
and
that
house
does
not
front
on
the
place
malesherbes
but
upon
an
adjacent
street
the
rue
montchanin
if
i
remember
the
name
correctly
and
i
now
understand
how
clotilde
destange
can
meet
her
lover
and
at
the
same
time
create
the
impression
that
she
never
leaves
the
house
and
i
understand
also
how
arsène
lupin
was
enabled
to
make
his
mysterious
entrance
to
the
gallery
last
night
ah
there
must
be
another
connection
between
the
library
and
the
adjoining
room
one
more
house
full
of
ways
that
are
dark
and
no
doubt
lucien
destange
was
the
architect
as
usual
i
should
take
advantage
of
this
opportunity
to
examine
the
contents
of
the
cupboard
and
perhaps
learn
the
location
of
other
houses
with
secret
passages
constructed
by
monsieur
destange
sholmes
ascended
to
the
gallery
and
concealed
himself
behind
some
draperies
where
he
remained
until
late
in
the
evening
at
last
a
servant
came
and
turned
off
the
electric
lights
an
hour
later
the
englishman
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
made
his
way
to
the
cupboard
as
he
had
surmised
it
contained
the
architect
old
papers
plans
specifications
and
books
of
account
it
also
contained
a
series
of
registers
arranged
according
to
date
and
sholmes
having
selected
those
of
the
most
recent
dates
searched
in
the
indexes
for
the
name
harmingeat
he
found
it
in
one
of
the
registers
with
a
reference
to
page
turning
to
that
page
he
read
harmingeat
rue
chalgrin
this
was
followed
by
a
detailed
account
of
the
work
done
in
and
about
the
installation
of
a
furnace
in
the
house
and
in
the
margin
of
the
book
someone
had
written
these
words
see
account
ah
i
thought
so
said
sholmes
the
account
is
the
one
i
want
i
shall
learn
from
it
the
actual
residence
of
monsieur
lupin
it
was
morning
before
he
found
that
important
account
it
comprised
sixteen
pages
one
of
which
was
a
copy
of
the
page
on
which
was
described
the
work
done
for
mon
harmingeat
of
the
rue
chalgrin
another
page
described
the
work
performed
for
mon
vatinel
as
owner
of
the
house
at
no
rue
clapeyron
another
page
was
reserved
for
the
baron
avenue
another
was
devoted
to
the
château
de
crozon
and
the
eleven
other
pages
to
various
owners
of
houses
in
paris
sholmes
made
a
list
of
those
eleven
names
and
addresses
after
which
he
returned
the
books
to
their
proper
places
opened
a
window
jumped
out
onto
the
deserted
street
and
closed
the
shutters
behind
him
when
he
reached
his
room
at
the
hotel
he
lighted
his
pipe
with
all
the
solemnity
with
which
he
was
wont
to
characterize
that
act
and
amidst
clouds
of
smoke
he
studied
the
deductions
that
might
be
drawn
from
the
account
of
or
rather
from
the
account
of
maxime
bermond
alias
arsène
lupin
at
eight
he
sent
the
following
message
to
ganimard
i
expect
to
pass
through
the
rue
pergolese
this
forenoon
and
will
inform
you
of
a
person
whose
arrest
is
of
the
highest
importance
in
any
event
be
at
home
and
until
noon
and
have
at
least
thirty
men
at
your
service
then
he
engaged
an
automobile
at
the
stand
on
the
boulevard
choosing
one
whose
chauffeur
looked
but
and
instructed
him
to
drive
to
the
place
malesherbes
where
he
stopped
him
about
one
hundred
feet
from
monsieur
destange
house
my
boy
close
your
carriage
he
said
to
the
chauffeur
turn
up
the
collar
of
your
coat
for
the
wind
is
cold
and
wait
patiently
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
half
crank
up
your
machine
when
i
return
we
will
go
to
the
rue
pergolese
as
he
was
ascending
the
steps
leading
to
the
door
a
doubt
entered
his
mind
was
it
not
a
mistake
on
his
part
to
be
spending
his
time
on
the
affairs
of
the
blonde
lady
while
arsène
lupin
was
preparing
to
move
would
he
not
be
better
engaged
in
trying
to
find
the
abode
of
his
adversary
amongst
the
eleven
houses
on
his
list
ah
he
exclaimed
when
the
blonde
lady
becomes
my
prisoner
i
shall
be
master
of
the
situation
and
he
rang
the
bell
monsieur
destange
was
already
in
the
library
they
had
been
working
only
a
few
minutes
when
clotilde
entered
bade
her
father
good
morning
entered
the
adjoining
parlor
and
sat
down
to
write
from
his
place
sholmes
could
see
her
leaning
over
the
table
and
from
time
to
time
absorbed
in
deep
meditation
after
a
short
time
he
picked
up
a
book
and
said
to
monsieur
destange
here
is
a
book
that
mademoiselle
destange
asked
me
to
bring
to
her
when
i
found
it
he
went
into
the
little
parlor
stood
before
clotilde
in
such
a
manner
that
her
father
could
not
see
her
and
said
i
am
monsieur
stickmann
your
father
new
secretary
ah
said
clotilde
without
moving
my
father
has
changed
his
secretary
i
did
know
it
yes
mademoiselle
and
i
desire
to
speak
with
you
kindly
take
a
seat
monsieur
i
have
finished
she
added
a
few
words
to
her
letter
signed
it
enclosed
it
in
the
envelope
sealed
it
pushed
her
writing
material
away
rang
the
telephone
got
in
communication
with
her
dressmaker
asked
the
latter
to
hasten
the
completion
of
a
traveling
dress
as
she
required
it
at
once
and
then
turning
to
sholmes
she
said
i
am
at
your
service
monsieur
but
do
you
wish
to
speak
before
my
father
would
not
that
be
better
no
mademoiselle
and
i
beg
of
you
do
not
raise
your
voice
it
is
better
that
monsieur
destange
should
not
hear
us
for
whose
sake
is
it
better
yours
mademoiselle
i
can
not
agree
to
hold
any
conversation
with
you
that
my
father
may
not
hear
but
you
must
agree
to
this
it
is
imperative
both
of
them
arose
eye
to
eye
she
said
speak
monsieur
still
standing
he
commenced
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
pardon
me
if
i
am
mistaken
on
certain
points
of
secondary
importance
i
will
guarantee
however
the
general
accuracy
of
my
statements
can
we
not
dispense
with
these
preliminaries
monsieur
or
are
they
necessary
sholmes
felt
the
young
woman
was
on
her
guard
so
he
replied
very
well
i
will
come
to
the
point
five
years
ago
your
father
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
certain
young
man
called
maxime
bermond
who
was
introduced
as
a
contractor
or
an
architect
i
am
not
sure
which
it
was
but
it
was
one
or
the
other
monsieur
destange
took
a
liking
to
the
young
man
and
as
the
state
of
his
health
compelled
him
to
retire
from
active
business
he
entrusted
to
monsieur
bermond
the
execution
of
certain
orders
he
had
received
from
some
of
his
old
customers
and
which
seemed
to
come
within
the
scope
of
monsieur
bermond
ability
herlock
sholmes
stopped
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
girl
pallor
had
increased
yet
there
was
not
the
slightest
tremor
in
her
voice
when
she
said
i
know
nothing
about
the
circumstances
to
which
you
refer
monsieur
and
i
do
not
see
in
what
way
they
can
interest
me
in
this
way
mademoiselle
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
maxime
bermond
is
also
known
by
the
name
of
arsène
lupin
she
laughed
and
said
nonsense
arsène
lupin
maxime
bermond
is
arsène
lupin
oh
no
it
is
possible
i
have
the
honor
to
inform
you
of
that
fact
and
since
you
refuse
to
understand
my
meaning
i
will
add
that
arsène
lupin
has
found
in
this
house
a
friend
more
than
a
friend
and
accomplice
blindly
and
passionately
devoted
to
him
without
emotion
or
at
least
with
so
little
emotion
that
sholmes
was
astonished
at
her
she
declared
i
do
not
understand
your
object
monsieur
and
i
do
not
care
to
but
i
command
you
to
say
no
more
and
leave
this
house
i
have
no
intention
of
forcing
my
presence
on
you
replied
sholmes
with
equal
but
i
shall
not
leave
this
house
alone
and
who
will
accompany
you
monsieur
you
will
i
yes
mademoiselle
we
will
leave
this
house
together
and
you
will
follow
me
without
one
word
of
protest
the
strange
feature
of
the
foregoing
interview
was
the
absolute
coolness
of
the
two
adversaries
it
bore
no
resemblance
to
an
implacable
duel
between
two
powerful
wills
but
judging
solely
from
their
attitude
and
the
tone
of
their
voices
an
onlooker
would
have
supposed
their
conversation
to
be
nothing
more
serious
than
a
courteous
argument
over
some
impersonal
subject
clotilde
resumed
her
seat
without
deigning
to
reply
to
the
last
remark
of
herlock
sholmes
except
by
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
sholmes
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
it
is
ten
we
will
leave
here
in
five
minutes
perhaps
if
not
i
shall
go
to
monsieur
destange
and
tell
him
what
the
truth
i
will
tell
him
of
the
vicious
life
of
maxime
bermond
and
i
will
tell
him
of
the
double
life
of
his
accomplice
of
his
accomplice
yes
of
the
woman
known
as
the
blonde
lady
of
the
woman
who
was
blonde
what
proofs
will
you
give
him
i
will
take
him
to
the
rue
chalgrin
and
show
him
the
secret
passage
made
by
arsène
lupin
workmen
while
doing
the
work
of
which
he
had
the
control
between
the
houses
numbered
and
the
passage
which
you
and
he
used
two
nights
ago
well
i
will
then
take
monsieur
destange
to
the
house
of
monsieur
detinan
we
will
descend
the
servant
stairway
which
was
used
by
you
and
arsène
lupin
when
you
escaped
from
ganimard
and
we
will
search
together
the
means
of
communication
with
the
adjoining
house
which
fronts
on
the
boulevard
des
batignolles
and
not
upon
the
rue
clapeyron
well
i
will
take
monsieur
destange
to
the
château
de
crozon
and
it
will
be
easy
for
him
who
knows
the
nature
of
the
work
performed
by
arsène
lupin
in
the
restoration
of
the
château
to
discover
the
secret
passages
constructed
there
by
his
workmen
it
will
thus
be
established
that
those
passages
allowed
the
blonde
lady
to
make
a
nocturnal
visit
to
the
countess
room
and
take
the
blue
diamond
from
the
mantel
and
two
weeks
later
by
similar
means
to
enter
the
room
of
herr
bleichen
and
conceal
the
blue
diamond
in
his
a
strange
action
i
confess
a
woman
revenge
perhaps
but
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
well
after
that
said
herlock
sholmes
in
a
more
serious
tone
i
will
take
monsieur
destange
to
avenue
and
we
will
learn
how
the
baron
no
no
keep
quiet
stammered
the
girl
struck
with
a
sudden
terror
i
forbid
you
you
dare
to
say
that
it
was
i
you
accuse
me
i
accuse
you
of
having
killed
the
baron
no
no
it
is
a
lie
you
killed
the
baron
mademoiselle
you
entered
his
service
under
the
name
of
antoinette
bréhat
for
the
purpose
of
stealing
the
blue
diamond
and
you
killed
him
keep
quiet
monsieur
she
implored
him
since
you
know
so
much
you
must
know
that
i
did
not
murder
the
baron
i
did
not
say
that
you
murdered
him
mademoiselle
baron
was
subject
to
fits
of
insanity
that
only
sister
auguste
could
control
she
told
me
so
herself
in
her
absence
he
must
have
attacked
you
and
in
the
course
of
the
struggle
you
struck
him
in
order
to
save
your
own
life
frightened
at
your
awful
situation
you
rang
the
bell
and
fled
without
even
taking
the
blue
diamond
from
the
finger
of
your
victim
a
few
minutes
later
you
returned
with
one
of
arsène
lupin
accomplices
who
was
a
servant
in
the
adjoining
house
you
placed
the
baron
on
the
bed
you
put
the
room
in
order
but
you
were
afraid
to
take
the
blue
diamond
now
i
have
told
you
what
happened
on
that
night
i
repeat
you
did
not
murder
the
baron
and
yet
it
was
your
hand
that
struck
the
blow
she
had
crossed
them
over
her
forehead
those
long
delicate
white
hands
and
kept
them
thus
for
a
long
time
at
last
loosening
her
fingers
she
said
in
a
voice
rent
by
anguish
and
do
you
intend
to
tell
all
that
to
my
father
yes
and
i
will
tell
him
that
i
have
secured
as
witnesses
mademoiselle
gerbois
who
will
recognize
the
blonde
lady
sister
auguste
who
will
recognize
antoinette
bréhat
and
the
countess
de
crozon
who
will
recognize
madame
de
réal
that
is
what
i
shall
tell
him
you
will
not
dare
she
said
recovering
her
in
the
face
of
an
immediate
peril
he
arose
and
made
a
step
toward
the
library
clotilde
stopped
him
one
moment
monsieur
she
paused
reflected
a
moment
and
then
perfect
mistress
of
herself
said
you
are
herlock
sholmes
yes
what
do
you
want
of
me
what
do
i
want
i
am
fighting
a
duel
with
arsène
lupin
and
i
must
win
the
contest
is
now
drawing
to
a
climax
and
i
have
an
idea
that
a
hostage
as
precious
as
you
will
give
me
an
important
advantage
over
my
adversary
therefore
you
will
follow
me
mademoiselle
i
will
entrust
you
to
one
of
my
friends
as
soon
as
the
duel
is
ended
you
will
be
set
at
liberty
is
that
all
that
is
all
i
do
not
belong
to
the
police
service
of
this
country
and
consequently
i
do
not
consider
that
i
am
under
any
obligation
to
cause
your
arrest
she
appeared
to
have
come
to
a
decision
yet
she
required
a
momentary
respite
she
closed
her
eyes
the
better
to
concentrate
her
thoughts
sholmes
looked
at
her
in
surprise
she
was
now
so
tranquil
and
apparently
indifferent
to
the
dangers
which
threatened
her
sholmes
thought
does
she
believe
that
she
is
in
danger
probably
not
since
lupin
protects
her
she
has
confidence
in
him
she
believes
that
lupin
is
omnipotent
and
infallible
mademoiselle
he
said
i
told
you
that
we
would
leave
here
in
five
minutes
that
time
has
almost
expired
will
you
permit
me
to
go
to
my
room
monsieur
to
get
some
necessary
articles
certainly
mademoiselle
and
i
will
wait
for
you
in
the
rue
montchanin
jeanniot
the
concierge
is
a
friend
of
mine
ah
you
know
she
said
visibly
alarmed
i
know
many
things
very
well
i
will
ring
for
the
maid
the
maid
brought
her
hat
and
jacket
then
sholmes
said
you
must
give
monsieur
destange
some
reason
for
our
departure
and
if
possible
let
your
excuse
serve
for
an
absence
of
several
days
that
shall
not
be
necessary
i
shall
be
back
very
soon
they
exchanged
defiant
glances
and
an
ironic
smile
what
faith
you
have
in
him
said
sholmes
absolute
he
does
everything
well
does
he
he
succeeds
in
everything
he
undertakes
and
whatever
he
does
receives
your
approval
and
cooperation
i
love
him
she
said
with
a
touch
of
passion
in
her
voice
and
you
think
that
he
will
save
you
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
approaching
her
father
she
said
i
am
going
to
deprive
you
of
monsieur
stickmann
we
are
going
to
the
national
library
you
will
return
for
luncheon
perhaps
no
i
think
not
but
do
be
uneasy
then
she
said
to
sholmes
in
a
firm
voice
i
am
at
your
service
monsieur
absolutely
quite
so
i
warn
you
that
if
you
attempt
to
escape
i
shall
call
the
police
and
have
you
arrested
do
not
forget
that
the
blonde
lady
is
on
parole
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
i
shall
not
attempt
to
escape
i
believe
you
now
let
us
go
they
left
the
house
together
as
he
had
predicted
the
automobile
was
standing
where
sholmes
had
left
it
as
they
approached
it
sholmes
could
hear
the
rumbling
of
the
motor
he
opened
the
door
asked
clotilde
to
enter
and
took
a
seat
beside
her
the
machine
started
at
once
gained
the
exterior
boulevards
the
avenue
hoche
and
the
avenue
de
la
sholmes
was
considering
his
plans
he
thought
ganimard
is
at
home
i
will
leave
the
girl
in
his
care
shall
i
tell
him
who
she
is
no
he
would
take
her
to
prison
at
once
and
that
would
spoil
everything
when
i
am
alone
i
can
consult
my
list
of
addresses
taken
from
the
and
run
them
down
or
morning
at
the
latest
i
shall
go
to
ganimard
as
i
agreed
and
deliver
into
his
hands
arsène
lupin
and
all
his
band
he
rubbed
his
hand
gleefully
at
the
thought
that
his
duel
with
lupin
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
he
could
not
see
any
serious
obstacle
in
the
way
of
his
success
and
yielding
to
an
irrepressible
desire
to
give
vent
to
his
feelings
an
unusual
desire
on
his
part
he
exclaimed
excuse
me
mademoiselle
if
i
am
unable
to
conceal
my
satisfaction
and
delight
the
battle
has
been
a
difficult
one
and
my
success
is
therefore
more
enjoyable
a
legitimate
success
monsieur
of
which
you
have
a
just
right
to
be
proud
thank
you
but
where
are
we
going
the
chauffeur
must
have
misunderstood
my
directions
at
that
moment
they
were
leaving
paris
by
the
gate
de
neuilly
that
was
strange
as
the
rue
pergolese
is
not
outside
the
fortifications
sholmes
lowered
the
glass
and
said
chauffeur
you
have
made
a
mistake
rue
pergolese
the
man
made
no
reply
sholmes
repeated
in
a
louder
voice
i
told
you
to
go
to
the
rue
pergolese
still
the
man
did
not
reply
ah
but
you
are
deaf
my
friend
or
is
he
doing
it
on
purpose
we
are
very
much
out
of
our
way
rue
pergolese
turn
back
at
once
rue
pergolese
the
chauffeur
made
no
sign
of
having
heard
the
order
the
englishman
fretted
with
impatience
he
looked
at
clotilde
a
mysterious
smile
played
upon
her
lips
why
do
you
laugh
he
said
it
is
an
awkward
mistake
but
it
help
you
of
course
not
she
replied
then
an
idea
occurred
to
him
he
rose
and
made
a
careful
scrutiny
of
the
chauffeur
his
shoulders
were
not
so
broad
his
bearing
was
not
so
stiff
and
mechanical
a
cold
perspiration
covered
his
forehead
and
his
hands
clenched
with
sudden
fear
as
his
mind
was
seized
with
the
conviction
that
the
chauffeur
was
arsène
lupin
well
monsieur
sholmes
what
do
you
think
of
our
little
ride
delightful
monsieur
really
delightful
replied
sholmes
never
in
his
life
had
he
experienced
so
much
difficulty
in
uttering
a
few
simple
words
without
a
tremor
or
without
betraying
his
feelings
in
his
voice
but
quickly
by
a
sort
of
reaction
a
flood
of
hatred
and
rage
burst
its
bounds
overcame
his
and
brusquely
drawing
his
revolver
he
pointed
it
at
mademoiselle
destange
lupin
stop
this
minute
this
second
or
i
fire
at
mademoiselle
i
advise
you
to
aim
at
the
cheek
if
you
wish
to
hit
the
temple
replied
lupin
without
turning
his
head
maxime
do
go
so
fast
said
clotilde
the
pavement
is
slippery
and
i
am
very
timid
she
was
smiling
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
pavement
over
which
the
carriage
was
traveling
at
enormous
speed
let
him
stop
let
him
stop
said
sholmes
to
her
wild
with
rage
i
warn
you
that
i
am
desperate
the
barrel
of
the
revolver
brushed
the
waving
locks
of
her
hair
she
replied
calmly
maxime
is
so
imprudent
he
is
going
so
fast
i
am
really
afraid
of
some
accident
sholmes
returned
the
weapon
to
his
pocket
and
seized
the
handle
of
the
door
as
if
to
alight
despite
the
absurdity
of
such
an
act
clotilde
said
to
him
be
careful
monsieur
there
is
an
automobile
behind
us
he
leaned
over
there
was
an
automobile
close
behind
a
large
machine
of
formidable
aspect
with
its
sharp
prow
and
body
and
holding
four
men
clad
in
fur
coats
ah
i
am
well
guarded
thought
sholmes
i
may
as
well
be
patient
he
folded
his
arms
across
his
chest
with
that
proud
air
of
submission
so
frequently
assumed
by
heroes
when
fate
has
turned
against
them
and
while
they
crossed
the
river
seine
and
rushed
through
suresnes
rueil
and
chatou
motionless
and
resigned
controlling
his
actions
and
his
passions
he
tried
to
explain
to
his
own
satisfaction
by
what
miracle
arsène
lupin
had
substituted
himself
for
the
chauffeur
it
was
quite
improbable
that
the
fellow
he
had
selected
on
the
boulevard
that
morning
was
an
accomplice
placed
there
in
advance
and
yet
arsène
lupin
had
received
a
warning
in
some
way
and
it
must
have
been
after
he
sholmes
had
approached
clotilde
in
the
house
because
no
one
could
have
suspected
his
project
prior
to
that
time
since
then
sholmes
had
not
allowed
clotilde
out
of
his
sight
then
an
idea
struck
him
the
telephone
communication
desired
by
clotilde
and
her
conversation
with
the
dressmaker
now
it
was
all
quite
clear
to
him
even
before
he
had
spoken
to
her
simply
upon
his
request
to
speak
to
her
as
the
new
secretary
of
monsieur
destange
she
had
scented
the
danger
surmised
the
name
and
purpose
of
the
visitor
and
calmly
naturally
as
if
she
were
performing
a
commonplace
action
of
her
life
she
had
called
arsène
lupin
to
her
assistance
by
some
preconcerted
signal
how
arsène
lupin
had
come
and
caused
himself
to
be
substituted
for
the
chauffeur
were
matters
of
trifling
importance
that
which
affected
sholmes
even
to
the
point
of
appeasing
his
fury
was
the
recollection
of
that
incident
whereby
an
ordinary
woman
a
sweetheart
it
is
true
mastering
her
nerves
controlling
her
features
and
subjugating
the
expression
of
her
eyes
had
completely
deceived
the
astute
detective
herlock
sholmes
how
difficult
to
overcome
an
adversary
who
is
aided
by
such
confederates
and
who
by
the
mere
force
of
his
authority
inspires
in
a
woman
so
much
courage
and
strength
they
crossed
the
seine
and
climbed
the
hill
at
but
some
five
hundred
metres
beyond
that
town
the
automobile
slackened
its
speed
the
other
automobile
advanced
and
the
two
stopped
side
by
side
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
neighborhood
monsieur
sholmes
said
lupin
kindly
exchange
to
the
other
machine
ours
is
really
a
very
slow
one
indeed
said
sholmes
calmly
convinced
that
he
had
no
choice
also
permit
me
to
loan
you
a
fur
coat
as
we
will
travel
quite
fast
and
the
air
is
cool
and
accept
a
couple
of
sandwiches
as
we
can
not
tell
when
we
will
dine
the
four
men
alighted
from
the
other
automobile
one
of
them
approached
and
as
he
raised
his
goggles
sholmes
recognized
in
him
the
gentleman
in
the
frock
coat
that
he
had
seen
at
the
hungarian
restaurant
lupin
said
to
him
you
will
return
this
machine
to
the
chauffeur
from
whom
i
hired
it
he
is
waiting
in
the
first
to
the
right
as
you
go
up
the
rue
legendre
you
will
give
him
the
balance
of
the
thousand
francs
i
promised
him
ah
yes
kindly
give
your
goggles
to
monsieur
sholmes
he
talked
to
mlle
destange
for
a
moment
then
took
his
place
at
the
wheel
and
started
with
sholmes
at
his
side
and
one
of
his
men
behind
him
lupin
had
not
exaggerated
when
he
said
we
will
travel
quite
fast
from
the
beginning
he
set
a
breakneck
pace
the
horizon
rushed
to
meet
them
as
if
attracted
by
some
mysterious
force
and
disappeared
instantly
as
though
swallowed
up
in
an
abyss
into
which
many
other
things
such
as
trees
houses
fields
and
forests
were
hurled
with
the
tumultuous
fury
and
haste
of
a
torrent
as
it
approached
the
cataract
sholmes
and
lupin
did
not
exchange
a
word
above
their
heads
the
leaves
of
the
poplars
made
a
great
noise
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
rhythmically
arranged
by
the
regular
spacing
of
the
trees
and
the
towns
swept
by
like
spectres
manteo
vernon
gaillon
from
one
hill
to
the
other
from
to
canteleu
rouen
its
suburbs
its
harbor
its
miles
of
wharves
rouen
seemed
like
the
straggling
street
of
a
country
village
and
this
was
duclair
caudebec
the
country
of
caux
which
they
skimmed
over
in
their
terrific
flight
and
lillebonne
and
quillebeuf
then
suddenly
they
found
themselves
on
the
banks
of
the
seine
at
the
extremity
of
a
little
wharf
beside
which
lay
a
staunch
yacht
that
emitted
great
volumes
of
black
smoke
from
its
funnel
the
automobile
stopped
in
two
hours
they
had
traveled
over
forty
leagues
a
man
wearing
a
blue
uniform
and
a
goldlaced
cap
came
forward
and
saluted
lupin
said
to
him
all
ready
captain
did
you
receive
my
telegram
yes
i
got
it
is
ready
yes
monsieur
come
monsieur
sholmes
the
englishman
looked
around
saw
a
group
of
people
on
the
terrace
in
front
of
a
café
hesitated
a
moment
then
realizing
that
before
he
could
secure
any
assistance
he
would
be
seized
carried
aboard
and
placed
in
the
bottom
of
the
hold
he
crossed
the
and
followed
lupin
into
the
captain
cabin
it
was
quite
a
large
room
scrupulously
clean
and
presented
a
cheerful
appearance
with
its
varnished
woodwork
and
polished
brass
lupin
closed
the
door
and
addressed
sholmes
abruptly
and
almost
rudely
as
he
said
well
what
do
you
know
everything
everything
come
be
precise
his
voice
contained
no
longer
that
polite
if
ironical
tone
which
he
had
affected
when
speaking
to
the
englishman
now
his
voice
had
the
imperious
tone
of
a
master
accustomed
to
command
and
accustomed
to
be
obeyed
even
by
a
herlock
sholmes
they
measured
each
other
by
their
looks
enemies
now
open
and
implacable
foes
lupin
spoke
again
but
in
a
milder
tone
i
have
grown
weary
of
your
pursuit
and
do
not
intend
to
waste
any
more
time
in
avoiding
the
traps
you
lay
for
me
i
warn
you
that
my
treatment
of
you
will
depend
on
your
reply
now
what
do
you
know
everything
monsieur
arsène
lupin
controlled
his
temper
and
said
in
a
jerky
manner
i
will
tell
you
what
you
know
you
know
that
under
the
name
of
maxime
bermond
i
have
fifteen
houses
that
were
originally
constructed
by
monsieur
destange
yes
of
those
fifteen
houses
you
have
seen
four
yes
and
you
have
a
list
of
the
other
eleven
yes
you
made
that
list
at
monsieur
destange
house
on
that
night
no
doubt
yes
and
you
have
an
idea
that
amongst
those
eleven
houses
there
is
one
that
i
have
kept
for
the
use
of
myself
and
my
friends
and
you
have
intrusted
to
ganimard
the
task
of
finding
my
retreat
no
what
does
that
signify
it
signifies
that
i
choose
to
act
alone
and
do
not
want
his
help
then
i
have
nothing
to
fear
since
you
are
in
my
hands
you
have
nothing
to
fear
as
long
as
i
remain
in
your
hands
you
mean
that
you
will
not
remain
yes
arsène
lupin
approached
the
englishman
and
placing
his
hand
on
the
latter
shoulder
said
listen
monsieur
i
am
not
in
a
humor
to
argue
with
you
and
unfortunately
for
you
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
choose
so
let
us
finish
our
business
very
well
you
are
going
to
give
me
your
word
of
honor
that
you
will
not
try
to
escape
from
this
boat
until
you
arrive
in
english
waters
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
i
shall
escape
if
i
have
an
opportunity
replied
the
indomitable
sholmes
but
sapristi
you
know
quite
well
that
at
a
word
from
me
you
would
soon
be
rendered
helpless
all
these
men
will
obey
me
blindly
at
a
sign
from
me
they
would
place
you
in
irons
irons
can
be
broken
and
throw
you
overboard
ten
miles
from
shore
i
can
swim
i
had
thought
of
that
said
lupin
with
a
laugh
excuse
me
master
and
let
us
finish
you
will
agree
that
i
must
take
the
measures
necessary
to
protect
myself
and
my
friends
certainly
but
they
will
be
useless
and
yet
you
do
not
wish
me
to
take
them
it
is
your
duty
very
well
then
lupin
opened
the
door
and
called
the
captain
and
two
sailors
the
latter
seized
the
englishman
bound
him
hand
and
foot
and
tied
him
to
the
captain
bunk
that
will
do
said
lupin
it
was
only
on
account
of
your
obstinacy
and
the
unusual
gravity
of
the
situation
that
i
ventured
to
offer
you
this
indignity
the
sailors
retired
lupin
said
to
the
captain
let
one
of
the
crew
remain
here
to
look
after
monsieur
sholmes
and
you
can
give
him
as
much
of
your
own
company
as
possible
treat
him
with
all
due
respect
and
consideration
he
is
not
a
prisoner
but
a
guest
what
time
have
you
captain
five
minutes
after
two
lupin
consulted
his
watch
then
looked
at
the
clock
that
was
attached
to
the
wall
of
the
cabin
five
minutes
past
two
is
right
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
reach
southampton
nine
hours
easy
going
make
it
eleven
you
must
not
land
there
until
after
the
departure
of
the
midnight
boat
which
reaches
havre
at
eight
in
the
morning
do
you
understand
captain
let
me
repeat
as
it
would
be
very
dangerous
for
all
of
us
to
permit
monsieur
to
return
to
france
by
that
boat
you
must
not
reach
southampton
before
one
in
the
morning
i
understand
au
revoir
master
next
year
in
this
world
or
in
the
next
until
replied
sholmes
a
few
minutes
later
sholmes
heard
the
automobile
going
away
and
at
the
same
time
the
steam
puffed
violently
in
the
depths
of
the
boat
had
started
for
england
about
three
the
vessel
left
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
plunged
into
the
open
sea
at
that
moment
sholmes
was
lying
on
the
captain
bunk
sound
asleep
next
morning
it
being
the
tenth
and
last
day
of
the
duel
between
sholmes
and
lupin
the
de
published
this
interesting
bit
of
news
yesterday
a
judgment
of
ejectment
was
entered
in
the
case
of
arsène
lupin
against
herlock
sholmes
the
english
detective
although
signed
at
noon
the
judgment
was
executed
the
same
day
at
one
this
morning
sholmes
was
landed
at
southampton
chapter
vi
second
arrest
of
arsène
lupin
since
eight
a
dozen
had
encumbered
the
rue
crevaux
between
the
avenue
du
and
the
avenue
bugeaud
mon
felix
davey
was
leaving
the
apartment
in
which
he
lived
on
the
fourth
floor
of
no
and
mon
dubreuil
who
had
united
into
a
single
apartment
the
fifth
floor
of
the
same
house
and
the
fifth
floor
of
the
two
adjoining
houses
was
moving
on
the
same
day
a
mere
coincidence
since
the
gentlemen
were
unknown
to
each
other
the
vast
collection
of
furniture
regarding
which
so
many
foreign
agents
visited
him
every
day
a
circumstance
which
had
been
noticed
by
some
of
the
neighbors
but
was
not
spoken
of
until
later
was
this
none
of
the
twelve
vans
bore
the
name
and
address
of
the
owner
and
none
of
the
men
accompanying
them
visited
the
neighboring
wine
shops
they
worked
so
diligently
that
the
furniture
was
all
out
by
eleven
nothing
remained
but
those
scraps
of
papers
and
rags
that
are
always
left
behind
in
the
corners
of
the
empty
rooms
mon
felix
davey
an
elegant
young
man
dressed
in
the
latest
fashion
carried
in
his
hand
a
the
weight
of
which
indicated
that
its
owner
possessed
extraordinary
biceps
mon
felix
davey
walked
calmly
away
and
took
a
seat
on
a
bench
in
the
avenue
du
facing
the
rue
pergolese
close
to
him
a
woman
dressed
in
a
neat
but
inexpensive
costume
was
reading
a
newspaper
whilst
a
child
was
playing
with
a
shovel
in
a
heap
of
sand
after
a
few
minutes
felix
davey
spoke
to
the
woman
without
turning
his
head
ganimard
went
out
at
nine
this
morning
where
to
police
headquarters
alone
yes
no
telegram
during
the
night
no
do
they
suspect
you
in
the
house
no
i
do
some
little
things
for
madame
ganimard
and
she
tells
me
everything
her
husband
does
i
have
been
with
her
all
morning
very
well
until
further
orders
come
here
every
day
at
eleven
he
rose
and
walked
away
in
the
direction
of
the
dauphine
gate
stopping
at
the
chinese
pavilion
where
he
partook
of
a
frugal
repast
consisting
of
two
eggs
with
some
fruit
and
vegetables
then
he
returned
to
the
rue
crevaux
and
said
to
the
concierge
i
will
just
glance
through
the
rooms
and
then
give
you
the
keys
he
finished
his
inspection
of
the
room
that
he
had
used
as
a
library
then
he
seized
the
end
of
a
which
hung
down
the
side
of
the
chimney
the
pipe
was
bent
and
a
hole
made
in
the
elbow
to
this
hole
he
fitted
a
small
instrument
in
the
form
of
an
and
blew
into
it
a
slight
whistling
sound
came
by
way
of
reply
placing
the
trumpet
to
his
mouth
he
said
anyone
around
dubreuil
no
may
i
come
up
yes
he
returned
the
pipe
to
its
place
saying
to
himself
how
progressive
we
are
our
century
abounds
with
little
inventions
which
render
life
really
charming
and
picturesque
and
so
amusing
especially
when
a
person
knows
how
to
enjoy
life
as
i
do
he
turned
one
of
the
marble
mouldings
of
the
mantel
and
the
entire
half
of
the
mantel
moved
and
the
mirror
above
it
glided
in
invisible
grooves
disclosing
an
opening
and
the
lower
steps
of
a
stairs
built
in
the
very
body
of
the
chimney
all
very
clean
and
complete
the
stairs
were
constructed
of
polished
metal
and
the
walls
of
white
tiles
he
ascended
the
steps
and
at
the
fifth
floor
there
was
the
same
opening
in
the
chimney
mon
dubreuil
was
waiting
for
him
have
you
finished
in
your
rooms
yes
everything
cleared
out
yes
and
the
people
only
the
three
men
on
guard
very
well
come
on
they
ascended
to
the
upper
floor
by
the
same
means
one
after
the
other
and
there
found
three
men
one
of
whom
was
looking
through
the
window
anything
new
nothing
governor
all
quiet
in
the
street
yes
in
ten
minutes
i
will
be
ready
to
leave
you
will
go
also
but
in
the
meantime
if
you
see
the
least
suspicious
movement
in
the
street
warn
me
i
have
my
finger
on
the
all
the
time
dubreuil
did
you
tell
the
moving
men
not
to
touch
the
wire
of
that
bell
certainly
it
is
working
all
right
that
is
all
i
want
to
know
the
two
gentlemen
then
descended
to
the
apartment
of
felix
davey
and
the
latter
after
adjusting
the
marble
mantel
exclaimed
joyfully
dubreuil
i
should
like
to
see
the
man
who
is
able
to
discover
all
the
ingenious
devices
warning
bells
of
electric
wires
and
acoustic
tubes
invisible
passages
moving
floors
and
hidden
stairways
a
real
what
fame
for
arsène
lupin
fame
i
could
well
dispense
with
it
a
pity
to
be
compelled
to
leave
a
place
so
well
equipped
and
commence
all
over
again
dubreuil
and
on
a
new
model
of
course
for
it
would
never
do
to
duplicate
this
curse
herlock
sholmes
has
he
returned
to
paris
how
could
he
there
has
been
only
one
boat

from
southampton
and

at
midnight
only
one
train
from
havre
leaving
there
at
eight
this
morning
and
due
in
paris
at
eleven
fifteen
as
he
could
not

midnight
boat

the
instructions

captain
on
that
point
were
explicit

dieppe
do

will
come
back

too
late

i
am
to
see
her
in
an
hour
at
her
house

several
days
but
you
dubreuil

long
time

look
after
them

you
sure
that
we
are
not
being
watched
by
whom
i
am
not
afraid
of
anyone
but
sholmes
dubreuil
retired
felix
davey
made
a
last
tour
of
the
apartment
picked
up
two
or
three
torn
letters
then
noticing
a
piece
of
chalk
he
took
it
and
on
the
dark
paper
of
the
drew
a
large
frame
and
wrote
within
it
the
following
lupin
lived
here
for
five
years
at
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
this
little
pleasantry
seemed
to
please
him
very
much
he
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
whistling
a
lively
air
then
said
to
himself
now
that
i
have
placed
myself
in
touch
with
the
historians
of
future
generations
i
can
go
you
must
hurry
herlock
sholmes
as
i
shall
leave
my
present
abode
in
three
minutes
and
your
defeat
will
be
an
accomplished
fact
two
minutes
more
you
are
keeping
me
waiting
monsieur
sholmes
one
minute
more
are
you
not
coming
well
then
i
proclaim
your
downfall
and
my
apotheosis
and
now
i
make
my
escape
farewell
kingdom
of
arsène
lupin
i
shall
never
see
you
again
farewell
to
the
rooms
of
the
six
apartments
over
which
i
reigned
farewell
my
own
royal
bed
chamber
his
outburst
of
joy
was
interrupted
by
the
sharp
ringing
of
a
bell
which
stopped
twice
started
again
and
then
ceased
it
was
the
alarm
bell
what
was
wrong
what
unforeseen
danger
ganimard
no
that
possible
he
was
on
the
point
of
returning
to
his
library
and
making
his
escape
but
first
he
went
to
the
window
there
was
no
one
in
the
street
was
the
enemy
already
in
the
house
he
listened
and
thought
he
could
discern
certain
confused
sounds
he
hesitated
no
longer
he
ran
to
his
library
and
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
he
heard
the
noise
of
a
key
being
inserted
in
the
lock
of
the
vestibule
door
the
deuce
he
murmured
i
have
no
time
to
lose
the
house
may
be
surrounded
the
servants
stairway
impossible
fortunately
there
is
the
chimney
he
pushed
the
moulding
it
did
not
move
he
made
a
greater
effort
still
it
refused
to
move
at
the
same
time
he
had
the
impression
that
the
door
below
opened
and
that
he
could
hear
footsteps
good
god
he
cried
i
am
lost
if
this
cursed
mechanism
he
pushed
with
all
his
strength
nothing
moved
nothing
by
some
incredible
accident
by
some
evil
stroke
of
fortune
the
mechanism
which
had
worked
only
a
few
moments
ago
would
not
work
now
he
was
furious
the
block
of
marble
remained
immovable
he
uttered
frightful
imprecations
on
the
senseless
stone
was
his
escape
to
be
prevented
by
that
stupid
obstacle
he
struck
the
marble
wildly
madly
he
hammered
it
he
cursed
it
ah
what
the
matter
monsieur
lupin
you
seem
to
be
displeased
about
something
lupin
turned
around
herlock
sholmes
stood
before
him
herlock
sholmes
lupin
gazed
at
him
with
squinting
eyes
as
if
his
sight
were
defective
and
misleading
herlock
sholmes
in
paris
herlock
sholmes
whom
he
had
shipped
to
england
only
the
day
before
as
a
dangerous
person
now
stood
before
him
free
and
victorious
ah
such
a
thing
was
nothing
less
than
a
miracle
it
was
contrary
to
all
natural
laws
it
was
the
culmination
of
all
that
is
illogical
and
abnormal
herlock
sholmes
here
before
his
face
and
when
the
englishman
spoke
his
words
were
tinged
with
that
keen
sarcasm
and
mocking
politeness
with
which
his
adversary
had
so
often
lashed
him
he
said
monsieur
lupin
in
the
first
place
i
have
the
honor
to
inform
you
that
at
this
time
and
place
i
blot
from
my
memory
forever
all
thoughts
of
the
miserable
night
that
you
forced
me
to
endure
in
the
house
of
baron
of
the
injury
done
to
my
friend
wilson
of
my
abduction
in
the
automobile
and
of
the
voyage
i
took
yesterday
under
your
orders
bound
to
a
very
uncomfortable
couch
but
the
joy
of
this
moment
effaces
all
those
bitter
memories
i
forgive
everything
i
forget
everything
i
wipe
out
the
debt
i
am
paid
and
royally
paid
lupin
made
no
reply
so
the
englishman
continued
do
you
think
so
yourself
he
appeared
to
insist
as
if
demanding
an
acquiescence
as
a
sort
of
receipt
in
regard
to
the
part
after
a
moment
reflection
during
which
the
englishman
felt
that
he
was
scrutinized
to
the
very
depth
of
his
soul
lupin
declared
i
presume
monsieur
that
your
conduct
is
based
upon
serious
motives
very
serious
the
fact
that
you
have
escaped
from
my
captain
and
his
crew
is
only
a
secondary
incident
of
our
struggle
but
the
fact
that
you
are
here
before
me
alone
understand
alone
face
to
face
with
arsène
lupin
leads
me
to
think
that
your
revenge
is
as
complete
as
possible
as
complete
as
possible
this
house
surrounded
the
two
adjoining
houses
surrounded
the
apartment
above
this
the
apartments
on
the
fifth
floor
that
were
formerly
occupied
by
monsieur
dubreuil
are
surrounded
so
that
so
that
you
are
captured
monsieur
lupin
absolutely
captured
the
feelings
that
sholmes
had
experienced
during
his
trip
in
the
automobile
were
now
suffered
by
lupin
the
same
concentrated
fury
the
same
revolt
and
also
let
us
admit
the
same
loyalty
of
submission
to
force
of
circumstances
equally
brave
in
victory
or
defeat
our
accounts
are
squared
monsieur
said
lupin
frankly
the
englishman
was
pleased
with
that
confession
after
a
short
silence
lupin
now
quite
said
smiling
and
i
am
not
sorry
it
becomes
monotonous
to
win
all
the
time
yesterday
i
had
only
to
stretch
out
my
hand
to
finish
you
forever
today
i
belong
to
you
the
game
is
yours
lupin
laughed
heartily
and
then
continued
at
last
the
gallery
will
be
entertained
lupin
in
prison
how
will
he
get
out
in
prison
what
an
adventure
ah
sholmes
life
is
just
one
damn
thing
after
another
he
pressed
his
closed
hands
to
his
temples
as
if
to
suppress
the
tumultuous
joy
that
surged
within
him
and
his
actions
indicated
that
he
was
moved
by
an
uncontrollable
mirth
at
last
when
he
had
recovered
his
he
approached
the
detective
and
said
and
now
what
are
you
waiting
for
what
am
i
waiting
for
yes
ganimard
is
here
with
his
men
why
do
they
come
in
i
asked
him
not
to
and
he
consented
i
accepted
his
services
on
condition
that
he
would
be
guided
by
me
besides
he
thinks
that
felix
davey
is
only
an
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
then
i
will
repeat
my
question
in
another
form
why
did
you
come
in
alone
because
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
alone
ah
ah
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
that
idea
seemed
to
please
lupin
immensely
there
are
certain
circumstances
in
which
words
are
preferable
to
deeds
monsieur
sholmes
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
offer
you
an
easy
chair
how
would
you
like
that
broken
box
or
perhaps
you
would
prefer
the
window
ledge
i
am
sure
a
glass
of
beer
would
be
welcome
light
or
dark
but
sit
down
please
thank
you
we
can
talk
as
well
standing
up
very
well
proceed
i
will
be
brief
the
object
of
my
sojourn
in
france
was
not
to
accomplish
your
arrest
if
i
have
been
led
to
pursue
you
it
was
because
i
saw
no
other
way
to
achieve
my
real
object
which
was
to
recover
the
blue
diamond
the
blue
diamond
certainly
since
the
one
found
in
herr
bleichen
was
only
an
imitation
quite
right
the
genuine
diamond
was
taken
by
the
blonde
lady
i
made
an
exact
duplicate
of
it
and
then
as
i
had
designs
on
other
jewels
belonging
to
the
countess
and
as
the
consul
herr
bleichen
was
already
under
suspicion
the
aforesaid
blonde
lady
in
order
to
avert
suspicion
slipped
the
false
stone
into
the
aforesaid
consul
luggage
while
you
kept
the
genuine
diamond
of
course
that
diamond
i
want
it
i
am
very
sorry
but
it
is
impossible
i
have
promised
it
to
the
countess
de
crozon
i
must
have
it
how
will
you
get
it
since
it
is
in
my
possession
that
is
precisely
the
reason
because
it
is
in
your
possession
oh
i
am
to
give
it
to
you
yes
voluntarily
i
will
buy
it
ah
exclaimed
lupin
in
an
access
of
mirth
you
are
certainly
an
englishman
you
treat
this
as
a
matter
of
business
it
is
a
matter
of
business
well
what
is
your
offer
the
liberty
of
mademoiselle
destange
her
liberty
i
did
know
she
was
under
arrest
i
will
give
monsieur
ganimard
the
necessary
information
when
deprived
of
your
protection
she
can
readily
be
taken
lupin
laughed
again
and
said
my
dear
monsieur
you
are
offering
me
something
you
do
not
possess
mademoiselle
destange
is
in
a
place
of
safety
and
has
nothing
to
fear
you
must
make
me
another
offer
the
englishman
hesitated
visibly
embarrassed
and
vexed
then
placing
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
his
adversary
he
said
and
if
i
should
propose
to
my
liberty
no
but
i
can
leave
the
room
to
consult
with
ganimard
and
leave
me
alone
yes
ah
mon
dieu
what
good
would
that
be
the
cursed
mechanism
will
not
work
said
lupin
at
the
same
time
savagely
pushing
the
moulding
of
the
mantel
he
stifled
a
cry
of
surprise
this
time
fortune
favored
him
the
block
of
marble
moved
it
was
his
salvation
his
hope
of
escape
in
that
event
why
submit
to
the
conditions
imposed
by
sholmes
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
as
if
he
were
considering
his
reply
then
in
his
turn
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
his
adversary
and
said
all
things
considered
monsieur
sholmes
i
prefer
to
do
my
own
business
in
my
own
way
but
no
i
do
require
anyone
assistance
when
ganimard
gets
his
hand
on
you
it
will
be
all
over
you
escape
from
them
who
knows
come
that
is
foolish
every
door
and
window
is
guarded
except
one
which
one
i
will
mere
words
your
arrest
is
as
good
as
made
oh
no
not
at
all
well
i
shall
keep
the
blue
diamond
sholmes
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
it
is
now
ten
minutes
to
three
at
three
i
shall
call
ganimard
well
then
we
have
ten
minutes
to
chat
and
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
monsieur
sholmes
i
should
like
to
know
how
you
procured
my
address
and
my
name
of
felix
davey
although
his
adversary
easy
manner
caused
sholmes
some
anxiety
he
was
willing
to
give
lupin
the
desired
information
since
it
reflected
credit
on
his
professional
astuteness
so
he
replied
your
address
i
got
it
from
the
blonde
lady
clotilde
herself
do
you
remember
yesterday
morning
when
i
wished
to
take
her
away
in
the
automobile
she
telephoned
to
her
dressmaker
well
well
i
understood
later
that
you
were
the
dressmaker
and
last
night
on
the
boat
by
exercising
my
memory
and
my
memory
is
something
i
have
good
reason
to
be
proud
of
i
was
able
to
recollect
the
last
two
figures
of
your
telephone
number
then
as
i
possessed
a
list
of
the
houses
you
had
it
was
an
easy
matter
on
my
arrival
in
paris
at
eleven
this
morning
to
search
in
the
telephone
directory
and
find
there
the
name
and
address
of
felix
davey
having
obtained
that
information
i
asked
the
aid
of
monsieur
ganimard
admirable
i
congratulate
you
but
bow
did
you
manage
to
catch
the
eight
train
at
havre
how
did
you
escape
from
i
did
not
escape
but
you
ordered
the
captain
not
to
reach
southampton
before
one
he
landed
me
there
at
midnight
i
was
able
to
catch
the
twelve
boat
for
havre
did
the
captain
betray
me
i
ca
believe
it
no
he
did
not
betray
you
well
what
then
it
was
his
watch
his
watch
yes
i
put
it
ahead
one
hour
how
in
the
usual
way
by
turning
the
hands
we
were
sitting
side
by
side
talking
and
i
was
telling
him
some
funny
stories
why
he
never
saw
me
do
it
bravo
a
very
clever
trick
i
shall
not
forget
it
but
the
clock
that
was
hanging
on
the
wall
of
the
cabin
ah
the
clock
was
a
more
difficult
matter
as
my
feet
were
tied
but
the
sailor
who
guarded
me
during
the
captain
absence
was
kind
enough
to
turn
the
hands
for
me
he
nonsense
he
would
do
it
oh
but
he
did
know
the
importance
of
his
act
i
told
him
i
must
catch
the
first
train
for
london
at
any
price
and
he
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
by
means
of
by
means
of
a
slight
gift
which
the
excellent
fellow
loyal
and
true
to
his
master
intends
to
send
to
you
what
was
it
a
mere
trifle
but
what
the
blue
diamond
the
blue
diamond
yes
the
false
stone
that
you
substituted
for
the
countess
diamond
she
gave
it
to
me
there
was
a
sudden
explosion
of
violent
laughter
lupin
laughed
until
the
tears
started
in
his
eyes
mon
dieu
but
it
is
funny
my
false
diamond
palmed
off
on
my
innocent
sailor
and
the
captain
watch
and
the
hands
of
the
clock
sholmes
felt
that
the
duel
between
him
and
lupin
was
keener
than
ever
his
marvellous
instinct
warned
him
that
behind
his
adversary
display
of
mirth
there
was
a
shrewd
intellect
debating
the
ways
and
means
to
escape
gradually
lupin
approached
the
englishman
who
recoiled
and
unconsciously
slipped
his
hand
into
his
it
is
three
monsieur
lupin
three
already
what
a
pity
we
were
enjoying
our
chat
so
much
i
am
waiting
for
your
answer
my
answer
mon
dieu
but
you
are
particular
and
so
this
is
the
last
move
in
our
little
game
and
the
stake
is
my
liberty
or
the
blue
diamond
very
well
it
your
play
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
play
the
king
said
sholmes
as
he
fired
his
revolver
and
i
the
ace
replied
lupin
as
he
struck
at
sholmes
with
his
fist
sholmes
had
fired
into
the
air
as
a
signal
to
ganimard
whose
assistance
he
required
but
lupin
fist
had
caught
sholmes
in
the
stomach
and
caused
him
to
double
up
with
pain
lupin
rushed
to
the
fireplace
and
set
the
marble
slab
in
motion
too
late
the
door
opened
surrender
lupin
or
i
fire
ganimard
doubtless
stationed
closer
than
lupin
had
thought
ganimard
was
there
with
his
revolver
turned
on
lupin
and
behind
ganimard
there
were
twenty
men
strong
and
ruthless
fellows
who
would
beat
him
like
a
dog
at
the
least
sign
of
resistance
hands
down
i
surrender
said
lupin
calmly
and
he
folded
his
arms
across
his
breast
everyone
was
amazed
in
the
room
divested
of
its
furniture
and
hangings
arsène
lupin
words
sounded
like
an
echo
i
surrender
it
seemed
incredible
no
one
would
have
been
astonished
if
he
had
suddenly
vanished
through
a
trap
or
if
a
section
of
the
wall
had
rolled
away
and
allowed
him
to
escape
but
he
surrendered
ganimard
advanced
nervously
and
with
all
the
gravity
that
the
importance
of
the
occasion
demanded
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
his
adversary
and
had
the
infinite
pleasure
of
saying
i
arrest
you
arsène
lupin
brrr
said
lupin
you
make
me
shiver
my
dear
ganimard
what
a
lugubrious
face
one
would
imagine
you
were
speaking
over
the
grave
of
a
friend
for
heaven
sake
do
assume
such
a
funereal
air
i
arrest
you
do
let
that
worry
you
in
the
name
of
the
law
of
which
he
is
a
pillar
ganimard
the
celebrated
parisian
detective
arrests
the
wicked
arsène
lupin
an
historic
event
of
which
you
will
appreciate
the
true
importance
and
it
is
the
second
time
that
it
has
happened
bravo
ganimard
you
are
sure
of
advancement
in
your
chosen
profession
and
he
held
out
his
wrists
for
the
ganimard
adjusted
them
in
a
most
solemn
manner
the
numerous
policemen
despite
their
customary
presumption
and
the
bitterness
of
their
feelings
toward
lupin
conducted
themselves
with
becoming
modesty
astonished
at
being
permitted
to
gaze
upon
that
mysterious
and
intangible
creature
my
poor
lupin
sighed
our
hero
what
would
your
aristocratic
friends
say
if
they
should
see
you
in
this
humiliating
position
he
pulled
his
wrists
apart
with
all
his
strength
the
veins
in
his
forehead
expanded
the
links
of
the
chain
cut
into
his
flesh
the
chain
fell
off
broken
another
comrades
that
one
was
useless
they
placed
two
on
him
this
time
quite
right
he
said
you
can
not
be
too
careful
then
counting
the
detectives
and
policemen
he
said
how
many
are
you
my
friends
thirty
that
too
many
i
ca
do
anything
ah
if
there
had
been
only
fifteen
there
was
something
fascinating
about
lupin
it
was
the
fascination
of
the
great
actor
who
plays
his
rôle
with
spirit
and
understanding
combined
with
assurance
and
ease
sholmes
regarded
him
as
one
might
regard
a
beautiful
painting
with
a
due
appreciation
of
all
its
perfection
in
coloring
and
technique
and
he
really
thought
that
it
was
an
equal
struggle
between
those
thirty
men
on
one
side
armed
as
they
were
with
all
the
strength
and
majesty
of
the
law
and
on
the
other
side
that
solitary
individual
unarmed
and
handcuffed
yes
the
two
sides
were
well
master
said
lupin
to
the
englishman
this
is
your
work
thanks
to
you
lupin
is
going
to
rot
on
the
damp
straw
of
a
dungeon
confess
that
your
conscience
pricks
you
a
little
and
that
your
soul
is
filled
with
remorse
in
spite
of
himself
sholmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
to
say
your
own
fault
never
never
exclaimed
lupin
give
you
the
blue
diamond
oh
no
it
has
cost
me
too
much
trouble
i
intend
to
keep
it
on
my
occasion
of
my
first
visit
to
you
in
london
which
will
probably
be
next
month
i
will
tell
you
my
reasons
but
will
you
be
in
london
next
month
or
do
you
prefer
vienna
or
saint
petersburg
then
lupin
received
a
surprise
a
bell
commenced
to
ring
it
was
not
the
but
the
bell
of
the
telephone
which
was
located
between
the
two
windows
of
the
room
and
had
not
yet
been
removed
the
telephone
ah
who
could
it
be
who
was
about
to
fall
into
this
unfortunate
trap
arsène
lupin
exhibited
an
access
of
rage
against
the
unlucky
instrument
as
if
he
would
like
to
break
it
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
thus
stifle
the
mysterious
voice
that
was
calling
for
him
but
it
was
ganimard
who
took
down
the
receiver
and
said
hello
hello
number
yes
this
is
it
then
sholmes
stepped
up
and
with
an
air
of
authority
pushed
ganimard
aside
took
the
receiver
and
covered
the
transmitter
with
his
handkerchief
in
order
to
obscure
the
tone
of
his
voice
at
that
moment
he
glanced
toward
lupin
and
the
look
which
they
exchanged
indicated
that
the
same
idea
had
occurred
to
each
of
them
and
that
they
the
ultimate
result
of
that
theory
it
was
the
blonde
lady
who
was
telephoning
she
wished
to
telephone
to
felix
davey
or
rather
to
maxime
bermond
and
it
was
to
sholmes
she
was
about
to
speak
the
englishman
said
hello
hello
then
after
a
silence
he
said
yes
it
is
i
maxime
the
drama
had
commenced
and
was
progressing
with
tragic
precision
lupin
the
irrepressible
and
nonchalant
lupin
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
his
anxiety
and
he
strained
every
nerve
in
a
desire
to
hear
or
at
least
to
divine
the
purport
of
the
conversation
and
sholmes
continued
in
reply
to
the
mysterious
voice
hello
hello
yes
everything
has
been
moved
and
i
am
just
ready
to
leave
here
and
meet
you
as
we
agreed
where
where
you
are
now
do
believe
that
he
is
here
yet
sholmes
stopped
seeking
for
words
it
was
clear
that
he
was
trying
to
question
the
girl
without
betraying
himself
and
that
he
was
ignorant
of
her
whereabouts
moreover
ganimard
presence
seemed
to
embarrass
him
ah
if
some
miracle
would
only
interrupt
that
cursed
conversation
lupin
prayed
for
it
with
all
his
strength
with
all
the
intensity
of
his
incited
nerves
after
a
momentary
pause
sholmes
continued
hello
hello
do
you
hear
me
i
ca
hear
you
very
well
can
scarcely
make
out
what
you
say
are
you
listening
well
i
think
you
had
better
return
home
no
danger
now
but
he
is
in
england
i
have
received
a
telegram
from
southampton
announcing
his
arrival
the
sarcasm
of
those
words
sholmes
uttered
them
with
an
inexpressible
comfort
and
he
added
very
well
do
lose
any
time
i
will
meet
you
there
he
hung
up
the
receiver
monsieur
ganimard
can
you
furnish
me
with
three
men
for
the
blonde
lady
eh
yes
you
know
who
she
is
and
where
she
is
yes
good
that
settles
monsieur
lupin
folenfant
take
two
men
and
go
with
monsieur
sholmes
the
englishman
departed
accompanied
by
the
three
men
the
game
was
ended
the
blonde
lady
was
also
about
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
englishman
thanks
to
his
commendable
persistence
and
to
a
combination
of
fortuitous
circumstances
the
battle
had
resulted
in
a
victory
for
the
detective
and
in
irreparable
disaster
for
lupin
monsieur
sholmes
the
englishman
stopped
monsieur
lupin
lupin
was
clearly
shattered
by
this
final
blow
his
forehead
was
marked
by
deep
wrinkles
he
was
sullen
and
dejected
however
he
pulled
himself
together
and
notwithstanding
his
defeat
he
exclaimed
in
a
cheerful
tone
you
will
concede
that
fate
has
been
against
me
a
few
minutes
ago
it
prevented
my
escape
through
that
chimney
and
delivered
me
into
your
hands
now
by
means
of
the
telephone
it
presents
you
with
the
blonde
lady
i
submit
to
its
decrees
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
am
ready
to
our
negotiation
sholmes
took
ganimard
aside
and
asked
in
a
manner
that
did
not
permit
a
reply
the
authority
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
the
prisoner
then
he
approached
lupin
and
said
in
a
sharp
nervous
tone
what
do
you
want
mademoiselle
destange
liberty
you
know
the
price
yes
and
you
accept
yes
i
accept
your
terms
ah
said
the
englishman
in
surprise
but
you
refused
for
yourself
yes
i
can
look
out
for
myself
monsieur
sholmes
but
now
the
question
concerns
a
young
woman
and
a
woman
i
love
in
france
understand
we
have
very
decided
ideas
about
such
things
and
lupin
has
the
same
feelings
as
other
people
he
spoke
with
simplicity
and
candor
sholmes
replied
by
an
almost
imperceptible
inclination
of
his
head
and
murmured
very
well
the
blue
diamond
take
my
cane
there
at
the
end
of
the
mantel
press
on
the
head
of
the
cane
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
turn
the
iron
ferrule
at
the
bottom
holmes
took
the
cane
and
followed
the
directions
as
he
did
so
the
head
of
the
cane
divided
and
disclosed
a
cavity
which
contained
a
small
ball
of
wax
which
in
turn
enclosed
a
diamond
he
examined
it
it
was
the
blue
diamond
monsieur
lupin
mademoiselle
destange
is
free
is
her
future
safety
assured
has
she
nothing
to
fear
from
you
neither
from
me
nor
anyone
else
how
can
you
manage
it
quite
easily
i
have
forgotten
her
name
and
address
thank
you
and
au
revoir
for
i
will
see
you
again
sometime
monsieur
sholmes
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
then
followed
an
animated
conversation
between
sholmes
and
ganimard
which
was
abruptly
terminated
by
the
englishman
who
said
i
am
very
sorry
monsieur
ganimard
that
we
can
not
agree
on
that
point
but
i
have
no
time
to
waste
trying
to
convince
you
i
leave
for
england
within
an
hour
but
the
blonde
lady
i
do
not
know
such
a
person
and
yet
a
moment
ago
you
must
take
the
affair
as
it
stands
i
have
delivered
arsène
lupin
into
your
hands
here
is
the
blue
diamond
which
you
will
have
the
pleasure
of
returning
to
the
countess
de
crozon
what
more
do
you
want
the
blonde
lady
find
her
sholmes
pulled
his
cap
down
over
his
forehead
and
walked
rapidly
away
like
a
man
who
is
accustomed
to
go
as
soon
as
his
business
is
finished
bon
voyage
monsieur
cried
lupin
and
believe
me
i
shall
never
forget
the
friendly
way
in
which
our
little
business
affairs
have
been
arranged
my
regards
to
monsieur
wilson
not
receiving
any
reply
lupin
added
sneeringly
that
is
what
is
called
british
leave
ah
their
insular
dignity
lacks
the
flower
of
courtesy
by
which
we
are
distinguished
consider
for
a
moment
ganimard
what
a
charming
exit
a
frenchman
would
have
made
under
similar
circumstances
with
what
exquisite
courtesy
he
would
have
masked
his
triumph
but
god
bless
me
ganimard
what
are
you
doing
making
a
search
come
what
the
use
there
is
nothing
left
not
even
a
scrap
of
paper
i
assure
you
my
archives
are
in
a
safe
place
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
replied
ganimard
i
must
search
everything
lupin
submitted
to
the
operation
held
by
two
detectives
and
surrounded
by
the
others
he
patiently
endured
the
proceedings
for
twenty
minutes
then
he
said
hurry
up
ganimard
and
finish
you
are
in
a
hurry
of
course
i
am
an
important
appointment
at
the
police
station
no
in
the
city
ah
at
what
time
two
it
is
three
now
just
so
i
will
be
late
and
punctuality
is
one
of
my
virtues
well
give
me
five
minutes
not
a
second
more
said
lupin
i
am
doing
my
best
to
expedite
oh
do
talk
so
much
still
searching
that
cupboard
it
is
empty
here
are
some
letters
old
invoices
i
presume
no
a
packet
tied
with
a
ribbon
a
red
ribbon
oh
ganimard
for
god
sake
do
untie
it
from
a
woman
yes
a
woman
of
the
world
the
best
in
the
world
her
name
madame
ganimard
very
funny
very
funny
exclaimed
the
detective
at
that
moment
the
men
who
had
been
sent
to
search
the
other
rooms
returned
and
announced
their
failure
to
find
anything
lupin
laughed
and
said
parbleu
did
you
expect
to
find
my
visiting
list
or
evidence
of
my
business
relations
with
the
emperor
of
germany
but
i
can
tell
you
what
you
should
investigate
ganimard
all
the
little
mysteries
of
this
apartment
for
instance
that
is
a
speaking
tube
that
chimney
contains
a
stairway
that
wall
is
hollow
and
the
marvellous
system
of
bells
ah
ganimard
just
press
that
button
ganimard
obeyed
did
you
hear
anything
asked
lupin
no
neither
did
i
and
yet
you
notified
my
aeronaut
to
prepare
the
dirigible
balloon
which
will
soon
carry
us
into
the
clouds
come
said
ganimard
who
had
completed
his
search
we
had
enough
nonsense
let
be
off
he
started
away
followed
by
his
men
lupin
did
not
move
his
guardians
pushed
him
in
vain
well
said
ganimard
do
you
refuse
to
go
not
at
all
but
it
depends
on
what
where
you
want
to
take
me
to
the
of
course
then
i
refuse
to
go
i
have
no
business
there
are
you
crazy
did
i
not
tell
you
that
i
had
an
important
appointment
lupin
why
ganimard
i
have
an
appointment
with
the
blonde
lady
and
do
you
suppose
i
would
be
so
discourteous
as
to
cause
her
a
moment
anxiety
that
would
be
very
ungentlemanly
listen
lupin
said
the
detective
who
was
becoming
annoyed
by
this
persiflage
i
have
been
very
patient
with
you
but
i
will
endure
no
more
follow
me
impossible
i
have
an
appointment
and
i
shall
keep
it
for
the
last
time
follow
me
at
a
sign
from
ganimard
two
men
seized
lupin
by
the
arms
but
they
released
him
at
once
uttering
cries
of
pain
lupin
had
thrust
two
long
needles
into
them
the
other
men
now
rushed
at
lupin
with
cries
of
rage
and
hatred
eager
to
avenge
their
comrades
and
to
avenge
themselves
for
the
many
affronts
he
had
heaped
upon
them
and
now
they
struck
and
beat
him
to
their
heart
desire
a
violent
blow
on
the
temple
felled
lupin
to
the
floor
if
you
hurt
him
you
will
answer
to
me
growled
ganimard
in
a
rage
he
leaned
over
lupin
to
ascertain
his
condition
then
learning
that
he
was
breathing
freely
ganimard
ordered
his
men
to
carry
the
prisoner
by
the
head
and
feet
while
he
himself
supported
the
body
go
gently
now
do
jolt
him
ah
the
brutes
would
have
killed
him
well
lupin
how
goes
it
none
too
well
ganimard
you
let
them
knock
me
out
it
was
your
own
fault
you
were
so
obstinate
replied
ganimard
but
i
hope
they
did
hurt
you
they
had
left
the
apartment
and
were
now
on
the
landing
lupin
groaned
and
stammered
ganimard
the
elevator
they
are
breaking
my
bones
a
good
idea
an
excellent
idea
replied
ganimard
besides
the
stairway
is
too
narrow
he
summoned
the
elevator
they
placed
lupin
on
the
seat
with
the
greatest
care
ganimard
took
his
place
beside
him
and
said
to
his
men
go
down
the
stairs
and
wait
for
me
below
understand
ganimard
closed
the
door
of
the
elevator
suddenly
the
elevator
shot
upward
like
a
balloon
released
from
its
cable
lupin
burst
into
a
fit
of
sardonic
laughter
good
god
cried
ganimard
as
he
made
a
frantic
search
in
the
dark
for
the
button
of
descent
having
found
it
he
cried
the
fifth
floor
watch
the
door
of
the
fifth
floor
his
assistants
clambered
up
the
stairs
two
and
three
steps
at
a
time
but
this
strange
circumstance
happened
the
elevator
seemed
to
break
through
the
ceiling
of
the
last
floor
disappeared
from
the
sight
of
ganimard
assistants
suddenly
made
its
appearance
on
the
upper
floor
the
servants
floor
and
stopped
three
men
were
there
waiting
for
it
they
opened
the
door
two
of
them
seized
ganimard
who
astonished
at
the
sudden
attack
scarcely
made
any
defence
the
other
man
carried
off
lupin
i
warned
you
ganimard
about
the
dirigible
balloon
another
time
do
be
so
and
moreover
remember
that
arsène
lupin
does
allow
himself
to
be
struck
and
knocked
down
without
sufficient
reason
adieu
the
door
of
the
elevator
was
already
closed
on
ganimard
and
the
machine
began
to
descend
and
it
all
happened
so
quickly
that
the
old
detective
reached
the
ground
floor
as
soon
as
his
assistants
without
exchanging
a
word
they
crossed
the
court
and
ascended
the
servants
stairway
which
was
the
only
way
to
reach
the
servants
floor
through
which
the
escape
had
been
made
a
long
corridor
with
several
turns
and
bordered
with
little
numbered
rooms
led
to
a
door
that
was
not
locked
on
the
other
side
of
this
door
and
therefore
in
another
house
there
was
another
corridor
with
similar
turns
and
similar
rooms
and
at
the
end
of
it
a
servants
stairway
ganimard
descended
it
crossed
a
court
and
a
vestibule
and
found
himself
in
the
rue
picot
then
he
understood
the
situation
the
two
houses
built
the
entire
depth
of
the
lots
touched
at
the
rear
while
the
fronts
of
the
houses
faced
upon
two
streets
that
ran
parallel
to
each
other
at
a
distance
of
more
than
sixty
metres
apart
he
found
the
concierge
and
showing
his
card
enquired
did
four
men
pass
here
just
now
yes
the
two
servants
from
the
fourth
and
fifth
floors
with
two
friends
who
lives
on
the
fourth
and
fifth
floors
two
men
named
fauvel
and
their
cousins
whose
name
is
provost
they
moved
leaving
the
two
servants
who
went
away
just
now
ah
thought
ganimard
what
a
grand
opportunity
we
have
missed
the
entire
band
lived
in
these
houses
and
he
sank
down
on
a
chair
in
despair
forty
minutes
later
two
gentlemen
were
driven
up
to
the
station
of
the
northern
railway
and
hurried
to
the
calais
express
followed
by
a
porter
who
carried
their
valises
one
of
them
had
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
the
pallor
of
his
face
denoted
some
illness
the
other
man
was
in
a
jovial
mood
we
must
hurry
wilson
or
we
will
miss
the
train
ah
wilson
i
shall
never
forget
these
ten
days
neither
will
i
ah
it
was
a
great
struggle
superb
a
few
repulses
here
and
there
of
no
consequence
and
at
last
victory
all
along
the
line
lupin
arrested
the
blue
diamond
recovered
my
arm
broken
what
does
a
broken
arm
count
for
in
such
a
victory
as
that
especially
when
it
is
my
arm
ah
yes
do
you
remember
wilson
that
it
was
at
the
very
time
you
were
in
the
pharmacy
suffering
like
a
hero
that
i
discovered
the
clue
to
the
whole
mystery
how
lucky
the
doors
of
the
carriages
were
being
closed
all
aboard
hurry
up
gentlemen
the
porter
climbed
into
an
empty
compartment
and
placed
their
valises
in
the
rack
whilst
sholmes
assisted
the
unfortunate
wilson
what
the
matter
wilson
you
not
done
up
are
you
come
pull
your
nerves
together
my
nerves
are
all
right
well
what
is
it
then
i
have
only
one
hand
what
of
it
exclaimed
sholmes
cheerfully
you
are
not
the
only
one
who
has
had
a
broken
arm
cheer
up
sholmes
handed
the
porter
a
piece
of
fifty
centimes
thank
you
monsieur
sholmes
said
the
porter
the
englishman
looked
at
him
it
was
arsène
lupin
you
you
he
stammered
absolutely
astounded
and
wilson
brandished
his
sound
arm
in
the
manner
of
a
man
who
demonstrates
a
fact
as
he
said
you
you
but
you
were
arrested
sholmes
told
me
so
when
he
left
you
ganimard
and
thirty
men
had
you
in
charge
lupin
folded
his
arms
and
said
with
an
air
of
indignation
did
you
suppose
i
would
let
you
go
away
without
bidding
you
adieu
after
the
very
friendly
relations
that
have
always
existed
between
us
that
would
be
discourteous
and
ungrateful
on
my
part
the
train
whistled
lupin
continued
i
beg
your
pardon
but
have
you
everything
you
need
tobacco
and
matches
yes
and
the
evening
papers
you
will
find
in
them
an
account
of
my
arrest

last
exploit
monsieur
sholmes
and
now
au
revoir

delighted
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
and
if
ever
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
i
shall
be
only
too
happy
he
leaped
to
the
platform
and
closed
the
door
adieu
he
repeated
waving
his
handkerchief
adieu
i
shall
write
to
you
you
will
write
also
eh
and
your
arm
broken
wilson
i
am
truly
sorry

shall
expect
to
hear
from
both
of
you
a
postal
card
now
and
then
simply
address
lupin
paris
that
is
sufficient
adieu
see
you

chapter
vii
the
jewish
lamp
herlock
sholmes
and
wilson
were
sitting
in
front
of
the
fireplace
in
comfortable
armchairs
with
the
feet
extended
toward
the
grateful
warmth
of
a
glowing
coke
fire
sholmes
pipe
a
short
brier
with
a
silver
band
had
gone
out
he
knocked
out
the
ashes
filled
it
lighted
it
pulled
the
skirts
of
his
over
his
knees
and
drew
from
his
pipe
great
puffs
of
smoke
which
ascended
toward
the
ceiling
in
scores
of
shadow
rings
wilson
gazed
at
him
as
a
dog
lying
curled
up
on
a
rug
before
the
fire
might
look
at
his
master
with
great
round
eyes
which
have
no
hope
other
than
to
obey
the
least
gesture
of
his
owner
was
the
master
going
to
break
the
silence
would
he
reveal
to
wilson
the
subject
of
his
reverie
and
admit
his
satellite
into
the
charmed
realm
of
his
thoughts
when
sholmes
had
maintained
his
silent
attitude
for
some
time
wilson
ventured
to
speak
everything
seems
quiet
now
not
the
shadow
of
a
case
to
occupy
our
leisure
moments
sholmes
did
not
reply
but
the
rings
of
smoke
emitted
by
sholmes
were
better
formed
and
wilson
observed
that
his
companion
drew
considerable
pleasure
from
that
trifling
fact
an
indication
that
the
great
man
was
not
absorbed
in
any
serious
meditation
wilson
discouraged
arose
and
went
to
the
window
the
lonely
street
extended
between
the
gloomy
façades
of
grimy
houses
unusually
gloomy
this
morning
by
reason
of
a
heavy
downfall
of
rain
a
cab
passed
then
another
wilson
made
an
entry
of
their
numbers
in
his
one
never
knows
ah
he
exclaimed
the
postman
the
man
entered
shown
in
by
the
servant
two
registered
letters
sir
if
you
will
sign
please
sholmes
signed
the
receipts
accompanied
the
man
to
the
door
and
was
opening
one
of
the
letters
as
he
returned
it
seems
to
please
you
remarked
wilson
after
a
moment
silence
this
letter
contains
a
very
interesting
proposition
you
are
anxious
for
a
case
here
one
read
wilson
read
monsieur
i
desire
the
benefit
of
your
services
and
experience
i
have
been
the
victim
of
a
serious
theft
and
the
investigation
has
as
yet
been
unsuccessful
i
am
sending
to
you
by
this
mail
a
number
of
newspapers
which
will
inform
you
of
the
affair
and
if
you
will
undertake
the
case
i
will
place
my
house
at
your
disposal
and
ask
you
to
fill
in
the
enclosed
check
signed
by
me
for
whatever
sum
you
require
for
your
expenses
kindly
reply
by
telegraph
and
much
oblige
your
humble
servant
baron
victor
rue
murillo
paris
ah
exclaimed
sholmes
that
sounds
good
a
little
trip
to
paris
and
why
not
wilson
since
my
famous
duel
with
arsène
lupin
i
have
not
had
an
excuse
to
go
there
i
should
be
pleased
to
visit
the
capital
of
the
world
under
less
strenuous
conditions
he
tore
the
check
into
four
pieces
and
while
wilson
whose
arm
had
not
yet
regained
its
former
strength
uttered
bitter
words
against
paris
and
the
parisians
sholmes
opened
the
second
envelope
immediately
he
made
a
gesture
of
annoyance
and
a
wrinkle
appeared
on
his
forehead
during
the
reading
of
the
letter
then
crushing
the
paper
into
a
ball
he
threw
it
angrily
on
the
floor
well
what
the
matter
asked
wilson
anxiously
he
picked
up
the
ball
of
paper
unfolded
it
and
read
with
increasing
amazement
my
dear
monsieur
you
know
full
well
the
admiration
i
have
for
you
and
the
interest
i
take
in
your
renown
well
believe
me
when
i
warn
you
to
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
case
on
which
you
have
just
now
been
called
to
paris
your
intervention
will
cause
much
harm
your
efforts
will
produce
a
most
lamentable
result
and
you
will
be
obliged
to
make
a
public
confession
of
your
defeat
having
a
sincere
desire
to
spare
you
such
humiliation
i
implore
you
in
the
name
of
the
friendship
that
unites
us
to
remain
peacefully
reposing
at
your
own
fireside
my
best
wishes
to
monsieur
wilson
and
for
yourself
the
sincere
regards
of
your
devoted
arsène
lupin
arsène
lupin
repeated
wilson
astounded
sholmes
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
and
exclaimed
ah
he
is
pestering
me
already
the
fool
he
laughs
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
schoolboy
the
public
confession
of
my
defeat
did
i
force
him
to
disgorge
the
blue
diamond
i
tell
you
he
afraid
suggested
wilson
nonsense
arsène
lupin
is
not
afraid
and
this
taunting
letter
proves
it
but
how
did
he
know
that
the
baron
had
written
to
you
what
do
i
know
about
it
you
do
ask
some
stupid
questions
my
boy
i
thought
i
supposed
what
that
i
am
a
clairvoyant
or
a
sorcerer
no
but
i
have
seen
you
do
some
marvellous
things
no
person
can
perform
things
i
no
more
than
you
i
reflect
i
deduct
i
conclude
that
is
all
but
i
do
not
divine
only
fools
divine
wilson
assumed
the
attitude
of
a
whipped
cur
and
resolved
not
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
by
trying
to
divine
why
sholmes
paced
the
room
with
quick
nervous
strides
but
when
sholmes
rang
for
the
servant
and
ordered
his
valise
wilson
thought
that
he
was
in
possession
of
a
material
fact
which
gave
him
the
right
to
reflect
deduct
and
conclude
that
his
associate
was
about
to
take
a
journey
the
same
mental
operation
permitted
him
to
assert
with
almost
mathematical
exactness
sholmes
you
are
going
to
paris
possibly
and
lupin
affront
impels
you
to
go
rather
than
the
desire
to
assist
the
baron
possibly
sholmes
i
shall
go
with
you
ah
ah
my
old
friend
exclaimed
sholmes
interrupting
his
walking
you
are
not
afraid
that
your
right
arm
will
meet
the
same
fate
as
your
left
what
can
happen
to
me
you
will
be
there
that
the
way
to
talk
wilson
we
will
show
that
clever
frenchman
that
he
made
a
mistake
when
he
threw
his
glove
in
our
faces
be
quick
wilson
we
must
catch
the
first
train
without
waiting
for
the
papers
the
baron
has
sent
you
what
good
are
they
i
will
send
a
telegram
no
if
you
do
that
arsène
lupin
will
know
of
my
arrival
i
wish
to
avoid
that
this
time
wilson
we
must
fight
under
cover
that
afternoon
the
two
friends
embarked
at
dover
the
passage
was
a
delightful
one
in
the
train
from
calais
to
paris
sholmes
had
three
hours
sound
sleep
while
wilson
guarded
the
door
of
the
compartment
sholmes
awoke
in
good
spirits
he
was
delighted
at
the
idea
of
another
duel
with
arsène
lupin
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
the
satisfied
air
of
a
man
who
looks
forward
to
a
pleasant
vacation
at
last
exclaimed
wilson
we
are
getting
to
work
again
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
the
same
satisfied
air
at
the
station
sholmes
took
the
wraps
and
followed
by
wilson
who
carried
the
valises
he
gave
up
his
tickets
and
started
off
briskly
fine
weather
wilson
blue
sky
and
sunshine
paris
is
giving
us
a
royal
reception
yes
but
what
a
crowd
so
much
the
better
wilson
we
will
pass
unnoticed
no
one
will
recognize
us
in
such
a
crowd
is
this
monsieur
sholmes
he
stopped
somewhat
puzzled
who
the
deuce
could
thus
address
him
by
his
name
a
woman
stood
beside
him
a
young
girl
whose
simple
dress
outlined
her
slender
form
and
whose
pretty
face
had
a
sad
and
anxious
expression
she
repeated
her
enquiry
you
are
monsieur
sholmes
as
he
still
remained
silent
as
much
from
confusion
as
from
a
habit
of
prudence
the
girl
asked
a
third
time
have
i
the
honor
of
addressing
monsieur
sholmes
what
do
you
want
he
replied
testily
considering
the
incident
a
suspicious
one
you
must
listen
to
me
monsieur
sholmes
as
it
is
a
serious
matter
i
know
that
you
are
going
to
the
rue
murillo
what
do
you
say
i
know
i
know
rue
murillo
number
well
you
must
not
go
no
you
must
not
i
assure
you
that
you
will
regret
it
do
not
think
that
i
have
any
interest
in
the
matter
i
do
it
because
it
is
right
because
my
conscience
tells
me
to
do
it
sholmes
tried
to
get
away
but
she
persisted
oh
i
beg
of
you
do
neglect
my
advice
ah
if
i
only
knew
how
to
convince
you
look
at
me
look
into
my
eyes
they
are
sincere
they
speak
the
truth
she
gazed
at
sholmes
fearlessly
but
innocently
with
those
beautiful
eyes
serious
and
clear
in
which
her
very
soul
seemed
to
be
reflected
wilson
nodded
his
head
as
he
said
mademoiselle
looks
honest
yes
she
implored
and
you
must
have
confidence
i
have
confidence
in
you
mademoiselle
replied
wilson
oh
how
happy
you
make
me
and
so
has
your
friend
i
feel
it
i
am
sure
of
it
what
happiness
everything
will
be
all
right
now
what
a
good
idea
of
mine
ah
yes
there
is
a
train
for
calais
in
twenty
minutes
you
will
take
it
quick
follow
me
you
must
come
this
way
there
is
just
time
she
tried
to
drag
them
along
sholmes
seized
her
arm
and
in
as
gentle
a
voice
as
he
could
assume
said
to
her
excuse
me
mademoiselle
if
i
can
not
yield
to
your
wishes
but
i
never
abandon
a
task
that
i
have
once
undertaken
i
beseech
you
i
implore
you
ah
if
you
could
only
understand
sholmes
passed
outside
and
walked
away
at
a
quick
pace
wilson
said
to
the
girl
have
no
fear
he
will
be
in
at
the
finish
he
never
failed
yet
and
he
ran
to
overtake
sholmes
herlock
sholmes
arsène
lupin
these
words
in
great
black
letters
met
their
gaze
as
soon
as
they
left
the
railway
station
a
number
of
were
parading
through
the
street
one
behind
the
other
carrying
heavy
canes
with
iron
ferrules
with
which
they
struck
the
pavement
in
harmony
and
on
their
backs
they
carried
large
posters
on
which
one
could
read
the
following
notice
the
match
between
herlock
sholmes
and
arsène
lupin
arrival
of
the
english
champion
the
great
detective
attacks
the
mystery
of
the
rue
murillo
read
the
details
in
the
echo
de
france
wilson
shook
his
head
and
said
look
at
that
sholmes
and
we
thought
we
were
traveling
incognito
i
should
be
surprised
to
find
the
republican
guard
waiting
for
us
at
the
rue
murillo
to
give
us
an
official
reception
with
toasts
and
champagne
wilson
when
you
get
funny
you
get
beastly
funny
growled
sholmes
then
he
approached
one
of
the
with
the
obvious
intention
of
seizing
him
in
his
powerful
grip
and
crushing
him
together
with
his
infernal
there
was
quite
a
crowd
gathered
about
the
men
reading
the
notices
and
joking
and
laughing
repressing
a
furious
access
of
rage
sholmes
said
to
the
man
when
did
they
hire
you
this
morning
how
long
have
you
been
parading
about
an
hour
but
the
boards
were
ready
before
that
oh
yes
they
were
ready
when
we
went
to
the
agency
this
morning
so
then
it
appears
that
arsène
lupin
had
foreseen
that
he
sholmes
would
accept
the
challenge
more
than
that
the
letter
written
by
lupin
showed
that
he
was
eager
for
the
fray
and
that
he
was
prepared
to
measure
swords
once
more
with
his
formidable
rival
why
what
motive
could
arsène
lupin
have
in
renewing
the
struggle
sholmes
hesitated
for
a
moment
lupin
must
be
very
confident
of
his
success
to
show
so
much
insolence
in
advance
and
was
not
he
sholmes
falling
into
a
trap
by
rushing
into
the
battle
at
the
first
call
for
help
however
he
called
a
carriage
come
wilson
driver
rue
murillo
he
exclaimed
with
an
outburst
of
his
accustomed
energy
with
distended
veins
and
clenched
fists
as
if
he
were
about
to
engage
in
a
boxing
bout
he
jumped
into
the
carriage
the
rue
murillo
is
bordered
with
magnificent
private
residences
the
rear
of
which
overlook
the
parc
monceau
one
of
the
most
pretentious
of
these
houses
is
number
owned
and
occupied
by
the
baron
and
furnished
in
a
luxurious
manner
consistent
with
the
owner
taste
and
wealth
there
was
a
courtyard
in
front
of
the
house
and
in
the
rear
a
garden
well
filled
with
trees
whose
branches
mingle
with
those
of
the
park
after
ringing
the
bell
the
two
englishmen
were
admitted
crossed
the
courtyard
and
were
received
at
the
door
by
a
footman
who
showed
them
into
a
small
parlor
facing
the
garden
in
the
rear
of
the
house
they
sat
down
and
glancing
about
made
a
rapid
inspection
of
the
many
valuable
objects
with
which
the
room
was
filled
everything
very
choice
murmured
wilson
and
in
the
best
of
taste
it
is
a
safe
deduction
to
make
that
those
who
had
the
leisure
to
collect
these
articles
must
now
be
at
least
fifty
years
of
age
the
door
opened
and
the
baron
entered
followed
by
his
wife
contrary
to
the
deduction
made
by
wilson
they
were
both
quite
young
of
elegant
appearance
and
vivacious
in
speech
and
action
they
were
profuse
in
their
expressions
of
gratitude
so
kind
of
you
to
come
sorry
to
have
caused
you
so
much
trouble
the
theft
now
seems
of
little
consequence
since
it
has
procured
us
this
pleasure
how
charming
these
french
people
are
thought
wilson
evolving
one
of
his
commonplace
deductions
but
time
is
money
exclaimed
the
baron
especially
your
time
monsieur
sholmes
so
i
will
come
to
the
point
now
what
do
you
think
of
the
affair
do
you
think
you
can
succeed
in
it
before
i
can
answer
that
i
must
know
what
it
is
about
i
thought
you
knew
no
so
i
must
ask
you
for
full
particulars
even
to
the
smallest
detail
first
what
is
the
nature
of
the
case
a
theft
when
did
it
take
place
last
saturday
replied
the
baron
or
at
least
some
time
during
saturday
night
or
sunday
morning
that
was
six
days
ago
now
you
can
tell
me
all
about
it
in
the
first
place
monsieur
i
must
tell
you
that
my
wife
and
i
conforming
to
the
manner
of
life
that
our
position
demands
go
out
very
little
the
education
of
our
children
a
few
receptions
and
the
care
and
decoration
of
our
house
such
constitutes
our
life
and
nearly
all
our
evenings
are
spent
in
this
little
room
which
is
my
wife
boudoir
and
in
which
we
have
gathered
a
few
artistic
objects
last
saturday
night
about
eleven
i
turned
off
the
electric
lights
and
my
wife
and
i
retired
as
usual
to
our
room
where
is
your
room
it
adjoins
this
that
is
the
door
next
morning
that
is
to
say
sunday
morning
i
arose
quite
early
as
suzanne
my
wife
was
still
asleep
i
passed
into
the
boudoir
as
quietly
as
possible
so
as
not
to
wake
her
what
was
my
astonishment
when
i
found
that
window
open
as
we
had
left
it
closed
the
evening
before
a
servant
no
one
enters
here
in
the
morning
until
we
ring
besides
i
always
take
the
precaution
to
bolt
the
second
door
which
communicates
with
the
therefore
the
window
must
have
been
opened
from
the
outside
besides
i
have
some
evidence
of
that
the
second
pane
of
glass
from
the
right
close
to
the
fastening
had
been
cut
and
what
does
that
window
overlook
as
you
can
see
for
yourself
it
opens
on
a
little
balcony
surrounded
by
a
stone
railing
here
we
are
on
the
first
floor
and
you
can
see
the
garden
behind
the
house
and
the
iron
fence
which
separates
it
from
the
parc
monceau
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
thief
came
through
the
park
climbed
the
fence
by
the
aid
of
a
ladder
and
thus
reached
the
terrace
below
the
window
that
is
quite
certain
you
say
well
in
the
soft
earth
on
either
side
of
the
fence
they
found
the
two
holes
made
by
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
and
two
similar
holes
can
be
seen
below
the
window
and
the
stone
railing
of
the
balcony
shows
two
scratches
which
were
doubtless
made
by
the
contact
of
the
ladder
is
the
parc
monceau
closed
at
night
no
but
if
it
were
there
is
a
house
in
course
of
erection
at
number
and
a
person
could
enter
that
way
herlock
sholmes
reflected
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
said
let
us
come
down
to
the
theft
it
must
have
been
committed
in
this
room
yes
there
was
here
between
that
twelfth
century
virgin
and
that
tabernacle
of
chased
silver
a
small
jewish
lamp
it
has
disappeared
and
is
that
all
that
is
all
ah
and
what
is
a
jewish
lamp
one
of
those
copper
lamps
used
by
the
ancient
jews
consisting
of
a
standard
which
supported
a
bowl
containing
the
oil
and
from
this
bowl
projected
several
burners
intended
for
the
wicks
upon
the
whole
an
object
of
small
value
no
great
value
of
course
but
this
one
contained
a
secret
in
which
we
were
accustomed
to
place
a
magnificent
jewel
a
chimera
in
gold
set
with
rubies
and
emeralds
which
was
of
great
value
why
did
you
hide
it
there
oh
i
ca
give
any
reason
monsieur
unless
it
was
an
odd
fancy
to
utilize
a
of
that
kind
did
anyone
know
it
no
no
one
except
the
thief
said
sholmes
otherwise
he
would
not
have
taken
the
trouble
to
steal
the
lamp
of
course
but
how
could
he
know
it
as
it
was
only
by
accident
that
the
secret
mechanism
of
the
lamp
was
revealed
to
us
a
similar
accident
has
revealed
it
to
some
one
else
a
servant
or
an
acquaintance
but
let
us
proceed
i
suppose
the
police
have
been
notified
yes
the
examining
magistrate
has
completed
his
investigation
the
attached
to
the
leading
newspapers
have
also
made
their
investigations
but
as
i
wrote
to
you
it
seems
to
me
the
mystery
will
never
be
solved
sholmes
arose
went
to
the
window
examined
the
casement
the
balcony
the
terrace
studied
the
scratches
on
the
stone
railing
with
his
and
then
requested
mon
to
show
him
the
garden
outside
sholmes
sat
down
in
a
rattan
chair
and
gazed
at
the
roof
of
the
house
in
a
dreamy
way
then
he
walked
over
to
the
two
little
wooden
boxes
with
which
they
had
covered
the
holes
made
in
the
ground
by
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
with
a
view
of
preserving
them
intact
he
raised
the
boxes
kneeled
on
the
ground
scrutinized
the
holes
and
made
some
measurements
after
making
a
similar
examination
of
the
holes
near
the
fence
he
and
the
baron
returned
to
the
boudoir
where
madame
was
waiting
for
them
after
a
short
silence
sholmes
said
at
the
very
outset
of
your
story
baron
i
was
surprised
at
the
very
simple
methods
employed
by
the
thief
to
raise
a
ladder
cut
a
select
a
valuable
article
and
walk
out
again
no
that
is
not
the
way
such
things
are
done
all
that
is
too
plain
too
simple
well
what
do
you
think
that
the
jewish
lamp
was
stolen
under
the
direction
of
arsène
lupin
arsène
lupin
exclaimed
the
baron
yes
but
he
did
not
do
it
himself
as
no
one
came
from
the
outside
perhaps
a
servant
descended
from
the
upper
floor
by
means
of
a
waterspout
that
i
noticed
when
i
was
in
the
garden
what
makes
you
think
so
arsène
lupin
would
not
leave
this
room
but
he
had
the
lamp
but
that
would
not
have
prevented
his
taking
that
set
with
diamonds
or
that
opal
necklace
when
he
leaves
anything
it
is
because
he
ca
carry
it
away
but
the
marks
of
the
ladder
outside
a
false
scent
placed
there
simply
to
avert
suspicion
and
the
scratches
on
the
balustrade
a
farce
they
were
made
with
a
piece
of
sandpaper
see
here
are
scraps
of
the
paper
that
i
picked
up
in
the
garden
and
what
about
the
marks
made
by
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
counterfeit
examine
the
two
rectangular
holes
below
the
window
and
the
two
holes
near
the
fence
they
are
of
a
similar
form
but
i
find
that
the
two
holes
near
the
house
are
closer
to
each
other
than
the
two
holes
near
the
fence
what
does
that
fact
suggest
to
me
it
suggested
that
the
four
holes
were
made
by
a
piece
of
wood
prepared
for
the
purpose
the
better
proof
would
be
the
piece
of
wood
itself
here
it
is
said
sholmes
i
found
it
in
the
garden
under
the
box
of
a
laurel
tree
the
baron
bowed
to
sholmes
in
recognition
of
his
skill
only
forty
minutes
had
elapsed
since
the
englishman
had
entered
the
house
and
he
had
already
exploded
all
the
theories
theretofore
formed
and
which
had
been
based
on
what
appeared
to
be
obvious
and
undeniable
facts
but
what
now
appeared
to
be
the
real
facts
of
the
case
rested
upon
a
more
solid
foundation
the
astute
reasoning
of
a
herlock
sholmes
the
accusation
which
you
make
against
one
of
our
household
is
a
very
serious
matter
said
the
baroness
our
servants
have
been
with
us
a
long
time
and
none
of
them
would
betray
our
trust
if
none
of
them
has
betrayed
you
how
can
you
explain
the
fact
that
i
received
this
letter
on
the
same
day
and
by
the
same
mail
as
the
letter
you
wrote
to
me
he
handed
to
the
baroness
the
letter
that
he
had
received
from
arsène
lupin
she
exclaimed
in
amazement
arsène
lupin
how
could
he
know
did
you
tell
anyone
that
you
had
written
to
me
no
one
replied
the
baron
the
idea
occurred
to
us
the
other
evening
at
the
before
the
servants
no
only
our
two
children
oh
no
sophie
and
henriette
had
left
the
table
had
they
suzanne
madame
after
a
moment
reflection
replied
yes
they
had
gone
to
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
queried
sholmes
the
governess
mademoiselle
alice
demun
does
she
take
her
meals
with
you
no
her
meals
are
served
in
her
room
wilson
had
an
idea
he
said
the
letter
written
to
my
friend
herlock
sholmes
was
posted
of
course
who
posted
it
dominique
who
has
been
my
valet
for
twenty
years
replied
the
baron
any
search
in
that
direction
would
be
a
waste
of
time
one
never
wastes
his
time
when
engaged
in
a
search
said
wilson
sententiously
this
preliminary
investigation
now
ended
and
sholmes
asked
permission
to
retire
at
dinner
an
hour
later
he
saw
sophie
and
henriette
the
two
children
of
the
family
one
was
six
and
the
other
eight
years
of
age
there
was
very
little
conversation
at
the
table
sholmes
responded
to
the
friendly
advances
of
his
hosts
in
such
a
curt
manner
that
they
were
soon
reduced
to
silence
when
the
coffee
was
served
sholmes
swallowed
the
contents
of
his
cup
and
rose
to
take
his
leave
at
that
moment
a
servant
entered
with
a
telephone
message
addressed
to
sholmes
he
opened
it
and
read
you
have
my
enthusiastic
admiration
the
results
attained
by
you
in
so
short
a
time
are
simply
marvellous
i
am
dismayed
arsène
lupin
sholmes
made
a
gesture
of
indignation
and
handed
the
message
to
the
baron
saying
what
do
you
think
now
monsieur
are
the
walls
of
your
house
furnished
with
eyes
and
ears
i
do
understand
it
said
the
baron
in
amazement
nor
do
i
but
i
do
understand
that
lupin
has
knowledge
of
everything
that
occurs
in
this
house
he
knows
every
movement
every
word
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
but
how
does
he
get
his
information
that
is
the
first
mystery
i
have
to
solve
and
when
i
know
that
i
will
know
everything
that
night
wilson
retired
with
the
clear
conscience
of
a
man
who
has
performed
his
whole
duty
and
thus
acquired
an
undoubted
right
to
sleep
and
repose
so
he
fell
asleep
very
quickly
and
was
soon
enjoying
the
most
delightful
dreams
in
which
he
pursued
lupin
and
captured
him
and
the
sensation
was
so
vivid
and
exciting
that
it
woke
him
from
his
sleep
someone
was
standing
at
his
bedside
he
seized
his
revolver
and
cried
do
move
lupin
or
i
fire
the
deuce
wilson
what
do
you
mean
oh
it
is
you
sholmes
do
you
want
me
i
want
to
show
you
something
get
up
sholmes
led
him
to
the
window
and
said
look
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
in
the
park
yes
what
do
you
see
i
do
see
anything
yes
you
do
see
something
ah
of
course
a
shadow
two
of
them
yes
close
to
the
fence
see
they
are
moving
come
quick
quickly
they
descended
the
stairs
and
reached
a
room
which
opened
into
the
garden
through
the
glass
door
they
could
see
the
two
shadowy
forms
in
the
same
place
it
is
very
strange
said
sholmes
but
it
seems
to
me
i
can
hear
a
noise
inside
the
house
inside
the
house
impossible
everybody
is
asleep
well
listen
at
that
moment
a
low
whistle
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
fence
and
they
perceived
a
dim
light
which
appeared
to
come
from
the
house
the
baron
must
have
turned
on
the
light
in
his
room
it
is
just
above
us
that
must
have
been
the
noise
you
heard
said
wilson
perhaps
they
are
watching
the
fence
also
then
there
was
a
second
whistle
softer
than
before
i
do
understand
it
i
do
understand
said
sholmes
irritably
no
more
do
i
confessed
wilson
sholmes
turned
the
key
drew
the
bolt
and
quietly
opened
the
door
a
third
whistle
louder
than
before
and
modulated
to
another
form
and
the
noise
above
their
heads
became
more
pronounced
sholmes
said
it
seems
to
be
on
the
balcony
outside
the
boudoir
window
he
put
his
head
through
the
door
but
immediately
recoiled
with
a
stifled
oath
then
wilson
looked
quite
close
to
them
there
was
a
ladder
the
upper
end
of
which
was
resting
on
the
balcony
the
deuce
said
sholmes
there
is
someone
in
the
boudoir
that
is
what
we
heard
quick
let
us
remove
the
ladder
but
at
that
instant
a
man
slid
down
the
ladder
and
ran
toward
the
spot
where
his
accomplices
were
waiting
for
him
outside
the
fence
he
carried
the
ladder
with
him
sholmes
and
wilson
pursued
the
man
and
overtook
him
just
as
he
was
placing
the
ladder
against
the
fence
from
the
other
side
of
the
fence
two
shots
were
fired
wounded
cried
sholmes
no
replied
wilson
wilson
seized
the
man
by
the
body
and
tried
to
hold
him
but
the
man
turned
and
plunged
a
knife
into
wilson
breast
he
uttered
a
groan
staggered
and
fell
damnation
muttered
sholmes
if
they
have
killed
him
i
will
kill
them
he
laid
wilson
on
the
grass
and
rushed
toward
the
ladder
too
late
the
man
had
climbed
the
fence
and
accompanied
by
his
confederates
had
fled
through
the
bushes
wilson
wilson
it
is
not
serious
hein
merely
a
scratch
the
house
door
opened
and
monsieur
appeared
followed
by
the
servants
carrying
candles
what
the
matter
asked
the
baron
is
monsieur
wilson
wounded
oh
it
nothing
a
mere
scratch
repeated
sholmes
trying
to
deceive
himself
the
blood
was
flowing
profusely
and
wilson
face
was
livid
twenty
minutes
later
the
doctor
ascertained
that
the
point
of
the
knife
had
penetrated
to
within
an
inch
and
a
half
of
the
heart
an
inch
and
a
half
of
the
heart
wilson
always
was
lucky
said
sholmes
in
an
envious
tone
lucky
lucky
muttered
the
doctor
of
course
why
with
his
robust
constitution
he
will
soon
be
out
again
six
weeks
in
bed
and
two
months
of
convalescence
not
more
no
unless
complications
set
in
oh
the
devil
what
does
he
want
complications
for
fully
reassured
sholmes
joined
the
baron
in
the
boudoir
this
time
the
mysterious
visitor
had
not
exercised
the
same
restraint
ruthlessly
he
had
laid
his
vicious
hand
upon
the
diamond
upon
the
opal
necklace
and
in
a
general
way
upon
everything
that
could
find
a
place
in
the
greedy
pockets
of
an
enterprising
burglar
the
window
was
still
open
one
of
the
had
been
neatly
cut
and
in
the
morning
a
summary
investigation
showed
that
the
ladder
belonged
to
the
house
then
in
course
of
construction
now
you
can
see
said
mon
with
a
touch
of
irony
it
is
an
exact
repetition
of
the
affair
of
the
jewish
lamp
yes
if
we
accept
the
first
theory
adopted
by
the
police
have
you
adopted
it
yet
does
this
second
theft
shatter
your
theory
in
regard
to
the
first
it
only
confirms
it
monsieur
that
is
incredible
you
have
positive
evidence
that
last
night
theft
was
committed
by
an
outsider
and
yet
you
adhere
to
your
theory
that
the
jewish
lamp
was
stolen
by
someone
in
the
house
yes
i
am
sure
of
it
how
do
you
explain
it
i
do
not
explain
anything
monsieur
i
have
established
two
facts
which
do
not
appear
to
have
any
relation
to
each
other
and
yet
i
am
seeking
the
missing
link
that
connects
them
his
conviction
seemed
to
be
so
earnest
and
positive
that
the
baron
submitted
to
it
and
said
very
well
we
will
notify
the
police
not
at
all
exclaimed
the
englishman
quickly
not
at
all
i
intend
to
ask
for
their
assistance
when
i
need
it
but
not
before
but
the
attack
on
your
friend
that
of
no
consequence
he
is
only
wounded
secure
the
license
of
the
doctor
i
shall
be
responsible
for
the
legal
side
of
the
affair
the
next
two
days
proved
uneventful
yet
sholmes
was
investigating
the
case
with
a
minute
care
and
with
a
sense
of
wounded
pride
resulting
from
that
audacious
theft
committed
under
his
nose
in
spite
of
his
presence
and
beyond
his
power
to
prevent
it
he
made
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
house
and
garden
interviewed
the
servants
and
paid
lengthy
visits
to
the
kitchen
and
stables
and
although
his
efforts
were
fruitless
he
did
not
despair
i
will
succeed
he
thought
and
the
solution
must
be
sought
within
the
walls
of
this
house
this
affair
is
quite
different
from
that
of
the
blonde
lady
where
i
had
to
work
in
the
dark
on
unknown
ground
this
time
i
am
on
the
battlefield
itself
the
enemy
is
not
the
elusive
and
invisible
lupin
but
the
accomplice
in
flesh
and
blood
who
lives
and
moves
within
the
confines
of
this
house
let
me
secure
the
slightest
clue
and
the
game
is
mine
that
clue
was
furnished
to
him
by
accident
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
when
he
entered
a
room
located
above
the
boudoir
which
served
as
a
study
for
the
children
he
found
henriette
the
younger
of
the
two
sisters
she
was
looking
for
her
scissors
you
know
she
said
to
sholmes
i
make
papers
like
that
you
received
the
other
evening
the
other
evening
yes
just
as
dinner
was
over
you
received
a
paper
with
marks
on
it
you
know
a
telegram
well
i
make
them
too
she
left
the
room
to
anyone
else
these
words
would
seem
to
be
nothing
more
than
the
insignificant
remark
of
a
child
and
sholmes
himself
listened
to
them
with
a
distracted
air
and
continued
his
investigation
but
suddenly
he
ran
after
the
child
and
overtook
her
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
said
to
her
so
you
paste
stamps
and
marks
on
papers
henriette
very
proudly
replied
yes
i
cut
them
out
and
paste
them
on
who
taught
you
that
little
game
mademoiselle
my
governess
i
have
seen
her
do
it
often
she
takes
words
out
of
the
newspapers
and
pastes
them
what
does
she
make
out
of
them
telegrams
and
letters
that
she
sends
away
herlock
sholmes
returned
to
the
study
greatly
puzzled
by
the
information
and
seeking
to
draw
from
it
a
logical
deduction
there
was
a
pile
of
newspapers
on
the
mantel
he
opened
them
and
found
that
many
words
and
in
some
places
entire
lines
had
been
cut
out
but
after
reading
a
few
of
the
word
which
preceded
or
followed
he
decided
that
the
missing
words
had
been
cut
out
at
random
probably
by
the
child
it
was
possible
that
one
of
the
newspapers
had
been
cut
by
mademoiselle
but
how
could
he
assure
himself
that
such
was
the
case
mechanically
sholmes
turned
over
the
on
the
table
then
others
which
were
lying
on
the
shelf
of
a
bookcase
suddenly
he
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
in
a
corner
of
the
bookcase
under
a
pile
of
old
exercise
books
he
found
a
child
in
which
the
letters
were
ornamented
with
pictures
and
on
one
of
the
pages
of
that
book
he
discovered
a
place
where
a
word
had
been
removed
he
examined
it
it
was
a
list
of
the
days
of
the
week
monday
tuesday
wednesday
etc
the
word
saturday
was
missing
now
the
theft
of
the
jewish
lamp
had
occurred
on
a
saturday
night
sholmes
experienced
that
slight
fluttering
of
the
heart
which
always
announced
to
him
in
the
clearest
manner
that
he
had
discovered
the
road
which
leads
to
victory
that
ray
of
truth
that
feeling
of
certainty
never
deceived
him
with
nervous
fingers
he
hastened
to
examine
the
balance
of
the
book
very
soon
he
made
another
discovery
it
was
a
page
composed
of
capital
letters
followed
by
a
line
of
figures
nine
of
those
letters
and
three
of
those
figures
had
been
carefully
cut
out
sholmes
made
a
list
of
the
missing
letters
and
figures
in
his
memorandum
book
in
alphabetical
and
numerical
order
and
obtained
the
following
result
cdehnopez
well
at
first
sight
it
is
a
rather
formidable
puzzle
he
murmured
but
by
transposing
the
letters
and
using
all
of
them
is
it
possible
to
form
one
two
or
three
complete
words
sholmes
tried
it
in
vain
only
one
solution
seemed
possible
it
constantly
appeared
before
him
no
matter
which
way
he
tried
to
juggle
the
letters
until
at
length
he
was
satisfied
it
was
the
true
solution
since
it
harmonized
with
the
logic
of
the
facts
and
the
general
circumstances
of
the
case
as
that
page
of
the
book
did
not
contain
any
duplicate
letters
it
was
probable
in
fact
quite
certain
that
the
words
he
could
form
from
those
letters
would
be
incomplete
and
that
the
original
words
had
been
completed
with
letters
taken
from
other
pages
under
those
conditions
he
obtained
the
following
solution
errors
and
omissions
excepted
repond
z
ch
the
first
word
was
quite
clear
répondez
reply
a
letter
e
is
missing
because
it
occurs
twice
in
the
word
and
the
book
furnished
only
one
letter
of
each
kind
as
to
the
second
incomplete
word
no
doubt
it
formed
with
the
aid
of
the
number
an
address
to
which
the
reply
was
to
be
sent
they
appointed
saturday
as
the
time
and
requested
a
reply
to
be
sent
to
the
address
ch
or
perhaps
ch
was
an
address
for
a
letter
to
be
sent
to
the
general
delivery
of
some
postoffice
or
again
they
might
form
a
part
of
some
incomplete
word
sholmes
searched
the
book
once
more
but
did
not
discover
that
any
other
letters
had
been
removed
therefore
until
further
orders
he
decided
to
adhere
to
the
foregoing
interpretation
henriette
returned
and
observed
what
he
was
doing
amusing
is
it
yes
very
amusing
he
replied
but
have
you
any
other
papers
or
rather
words
already
cut
out
that
i
can
paste
papers
no
and
mademoiselle
would
like
it
mademoiselle
yes
she
has
scolded
me
already
why
because
i
have
told
you
some
things
and
she
says
that
a
person
should
never
tell
things
about
those
they
love
you
are
quite
right
henriette
was
delighted
to
receive
his
approbation
in
fact
so
highly
pleased
that
she
took
from
a
little
silk
bag
that
was
pinned
to
her
dress
some
scraps
of
cloth
three
buttons
two
cubes
of
sugar
and
lastly
a
piece
of
paper
which
she
handed
to
sholmes
see
i
give
it
to
you
just
the
same
it
was
the
number
of
a
cab
where
did
this
number
come
from
it
fell
out
of
her
pocketbook
when
sunday
at
mass
when
she
was
taking
out
some
sous
for
the
collection
exactly
and
now
i
shall
tell
you
how
to
keep
from
being
scolded
again
do
not
tell
mademoiselle
that
you
saw
me
sholmes
then
went
to
mon
and
questioned
him
in
regard
to
mademoiselle
the
baron
replied
indignantly
alice
demun
how
can
you
imagine
such
a
thing
it
is
utterly
impossible
how
long
has
she
been
in
your
service
only
a
year
but
there
is
no
one
in
the
house
in
whom
i
have
greater
confidence
why
have
i
not
seen
her
yet
she
has
been
away
for
a
few
days
but
she
is
here
now
yes
since
her
return
she
has
been
watching
at
the
bedside
of
your
friend
she
has
all
the
qualities
of
a
nurse
gentle
thoughtful
monsieur
wilson
seems
much
pleased
ah
said
sholmes
who
had
completely
neglected
to
inquire
about
his
friend
after
a
moment
reflection
he
asked
did
she
go
out
on
sunday
morning
the
day
after
the
theft
yes
the
baron
called
his
wife
and
asked
her
she
replied
mademoiselle
went
to
the
eleven
mass
with
the
children
as
usual
but
before
that
before
that
no
let
me
see
i
was
so
upset
by
the
theft
but
i
remember
now
that
on
the
evening
before
she
asked
permission
to
go
out
on
sunday
morning
to
see
a
cousin
who
was
passing
through
paris
i
think
but
surely
you
do
suspect
her
of
course
not
but
i
would
like
to
see
her
he
went
to
wilson
room
a
woman
dressed
in
a
gray
cloth
dress
as
in
the
hospitals
was
bending
over
the
invalid
giving
him
a
drink
when
she
turned
her
face
sholmes
recognized
her
as
the
young
girl
who
had
accosted
him
at
the
railway
station
alice
demun
smiled
sweetly
her
great
serious
innocent
eyes
showed
no
sign
of
embarrassment
the
englishman
tried
to
speak
muttered
a
few
syllables
and
stopped
then
she
resumed
her
work
acting
quite
naturally
under
sholmes
astonished
gaze
moved
the
bottles
unrolled
and
rolled
cotton
bandages
and
again
regarded
sholmes
with
her
charming
smile
of
pure
innocence
he
turned
on
his
heels
descended
the
stairs
noticed
mon
automobile
in
the
courtyard
jumped
into
it
and
went
to
levallois
to
the
office
of
the
cab
company
whose
address
was
printed
on
the
paper
he
had
received
from
henriette
the
man
who
had
driven
carriage
number
on
sunday
morning
not
being
there
sholmes
dismissed
the
automobile
and
waited
for
the
man
return
he
told
sholmes
that
he
had
picked
up
a
woman
in
the
vicinity
of
the
parc
monceau
a
young
woman
dressed
in
black
wearing
a
heavy
veil
and
apparently
quite
nervous
did
she
have
a
package
yes
quite
a
long
package
where
did
you
take
her
avenue
des
ternes
corner
of
the
place
she
remained
there
about
ten
minutes
and
then
returned
to
the
parc
monceau
could
you
recognize
the
house
in
the
avenue
des
ternes
parbleu
shall
i
take
you
there
presently
first
take
me
to
quai
des
orfèvres
at
the
police
office
he
saw
detective
ganimard
monsieur
ganimard
are
you
at
liberty
if
it
has
anything
to
do
with
lupin
no
it
has
something
to
do
with
lupin
then
i
do
not
go
what
you
surrender
i
bow
to
the
inevitable
i
am
tired
of
the
unequal
struggle
in
which
we
are
sure
to
be
defeated
lupin
is
stronger
than
i
am
stronger
than
the
two
of
us
therefore
we
must
surrender
i
will
not
surrender
he
will
make
you
as
he
has
all
others
and
you
would
be
pleased
to
see
it
eh
ganimard
at
all
events
it
is
true
said
ganimard
frankly
and
since
you
are
determined
to
pursue
the
game
i
will
go
with
you
together
they
entered
the
carriage
and
were
driven
to
the
avenue
des
ternes
upon
their
order
the
carriage
stopped
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
at
some
distance
from
the
house
in
front
of
a
little
café
on
the
terrace
of
which
the
two
men
took
seats
amongst
the
shrubbery
it
was
commencing
to
grow
dark
waiter
said
sholmes
some
writing
material
he
wrote
a
note
recalled
the
waiter
and
gave
him
the
letter
with
instructions
to
deliver
it
to
the
concierge
of
the
house
which
he
pointed
out
in
a
few
minutes
the
concierge
stood
before
them
sholmes
asked
him
if
on
the
sunday
morning
he
had
seen
a
young
woman
dressed
in
black
in
black
yes
about
nine
she
went
to
the
second
floor
have
you
seen
her
often
no
but
for
some
time
well
during
the
last
few
weeks
i
have
seen
her
almost
every
day
and
since
sunday
only
once
until
what
did
she
come
she
is
here
now
here
now
yes
she
came
about
ten
minutes
ago
her
carriage
is
standing
in
the
place
as
usual
i
met
her
at
the
door
who
is
the
occupant
of
the
second
floor
there
are
two
a
modiste
mademoiselle
langeais
and
a
gentleman
who
rented
two
furnished
rooms
a
month
ago
under
the
name
of
bresson
why
do
you
say
the
name
because
i
have
an
idea
that
it
is
an
assumed
name
my
wife
takes
care
of
his
rooms
and
well
there
are
not
two
shirts
there
with
the
same
initials
is
he
there
much
of
the
time
no
he
is
nearly
always
out
he
has
not
been
here
for
three
days
was
he
here
on
saturday
night
saturday
night
let
me
think
yes
saturday
night
he
came
in
and
stayed
all
night
what
sort
of
a
man
is
he
well
i
can
scarcely
answer
that
he
is
so
changeable
he
is
by
turns
big
little
fat
thin
dark
and
light
i
do
not
always
recognize
him
ganimard
and
sholmes
exchanged
looks
that
is
he
all
right
said
ganimard
ah
said
the
concierge
there
is
the
girl
now
mademoiselle
had
just
emerged
from
the
house
and
was
walking
toward
her
carriage
in
the
place
and
there
is
monsieur
bresson
monsieur
bresson
which
is
he
the
man
with
the
parcel
under
his
arm
but
he
is
not
looking
after
the
girl
she
is
going
to
her
carriage
alone
yes
i
have
never
seen
them
together
the
two
detectives
had
arisen
by
the
light
of
the
they
recognized
the
form
of
arsène
lupin
who
had
started
off
in
a
direction
opposite
to
that
taken
by
the
girl
which
will
you
follow
asked
ganimard
i
will
follow
him
of
course
he
the
biggest
game
then
i
will
follow
the
girl
proposed
ganimard
no
no
said
sholmes
quickly
who
did
not
wish
to
disclose
the
identity
to
ganimard
i
know
where
to
find
her
come
with
me
they
followed
lupin
at
a
safe
distance
taking
care
to
conceal
themselves
as
well
as
possible
amongst
the
moving
throng
and
behind
the
newspaper
kiosks
they
found
the
pursuit
an
easy
one
as
he
walked
steadily
forward
without
turning
to
the
right
or
left
but
with
a
slight
limp
in
the
right
leg
so
slight
as
to
require
the
keen
eye
of
a
professional
observer
to
detect
it
ganimard
observed
it
and
said
he
is
pretending
to
be
lame
ah
if
we
could
only
collect
two
or
three
policemen
and
pounce
on
our
man
we
run
a
chance
to
lose
him
but
they
did
not
meet
any
policemen
before
they
reached
the
porte
des
ternes
and
having
passed
the
fortifications
there
was
no
prospect
of
receiving
any
assistance
we
had
better
separate
said
sholmes
as
there
are
so
few
people
on
the
street
they
were
now
on
the
boulevard
they
walked
one
on
each
side
of
the
street
and
kept
well
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
they
continued
thus
for
twenty
minutes
when
lupin
turned
to
the
left
and
followed
the
seine
very
soon
they
saw
him
descend
to
the
edge
of
the
river
he
remained
there
only
a
few
seconds
but
they
could
not
observe
his
movements
then
lupin
retraced
his
steps
his
pursuers
concealed
themselves
in
the
shadow
of
a
gateway
lupin
passed
in
front
of
them
his
parcel
had
disappeared
and
as
he
walked
away
another
man
emerged
from
the
shelter
of
a
house
and
glided
amongst
the
trees
he
seems
to
be
following
him
also
said
sholmes
in
a
low
voice
the
pursuit
continued
but
was
now
embarrassed
by
the
presence
of
the
third
man
lupin
returned
the
same
way
passed
through
the
porte
des
ternes
and
the
house
in
the
avenue
des
ternes
the
concierge
was
closing
the
house
for
the
night
when
ganimard
presented
himself
did
you
see
him
yes
replied
the
concierge
i
was
putting
out
the
gas
on
the
landing
when
he
closed
and
bolted
his
door
is
there
any
person
with
him
no
he
has
no
servant
he
never
eats
here
is
there
a
servants
stairway
no
ganimard
said
to
sholmes
i
had
better
stand
at
the
door
of
his
room
while
you
go
for
the
commissary
of
police
in
the
rue
demours
and
if
he
should
escape
during
that
time
said
sholmes
while
i
am
here
he
ca
escape
one
to
one
with
lupin
is
not
an
even
chance
for
you
well
i
ca
force
the
door
i
have
no
right
to
do
that
especially
at
night
sholmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
when
you
arrest
lupin
no
one
will
question
the
methods
by
which
you
made
the
arrest
however
let
us
go
up
and
ring
and
see
what
happens
then
they
ascended
to
the
second
floor
there
was
a
double
door
at
the
left
of
the
landing
ganimard
rang
the
bell
no
reply
he
rang
again
still
no
reply
let
us
go
in
said
sholmes
all
right
come
on
replied
ganimard
yet
they
stood
still
irresolute
like
people
who
hesitate
when
they
ought
to
accomplish
a
decisive
action
they
feared
to
move
and
it
seemed
to
them
impossible
that
arsène
lupin
was
there
so
close
to
them
on
the
other
side
of
that
fragile
door
that
could
be
broken
down
by
one
blow
of
the
fist
but
they
knew
lupin
too
well
to
suppose
that
he
would
allow
himself
to
be
trapped
in
that
stupid
manner
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
lupin
was
no
longer
there
through
the
adjoining
houses
over
the
roofs
by
some
conveniently
prepared
exit
he
must
have
already
made
his
escape
and
once
more
it
would
only
be
lupin
shadow
that
they
would
seize
they
shuddered
as
a
slight
noise
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
reached
their
ears
then
they
had
the
impression
amounting
almost
to
a
certainty
that
he
was
there
separated
from
them
by
that
frail
wooden
door
and
that
he
was
listening
to
them
that
he
could
hear
them
what
was
to
be
done
the
situation
was
a
serious
one
in
spite
of
their
vast
experience
as
detectives
they
were
so
nervous
and
excited
that
they
thought
they
could
hear
the
beating
of
their
own
hearts
ganimard
questioned
sholmes
by
a
look
then
he
struck
the
door
a
violent
blow
with
his
fist
immediately
they
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
concerning
which
there
was
no
attempt
at
concealment
ganimard
shook
the
door
then
he
and
sholmes
uniting
their
efforts
rushed
at
the
door
and
burst
it
open
with
their
shoulders
then
they
stood
still
in
surprise
a
shot
had
been
fired
in
the
adjoining
room
another
shot
and
the
sound
of
a
falling
body
when
they
entered
they
saw
the
man
lying
on
the
floor
with
his
face
toward
the
marble
mantel
his
revolver
had
fallen
from
his
hand
ganimard
stooped
and
turned
the
man
head
the
face
was
covered
with
blood
which
was
flowing
from
two
wounds
one
in
the
cheek
the
other
in
the
temple
you
ca
recognize
him
for
blood
no
matter
said
sholmes
it
is
not
lupin
how
do
you
know
you
have
even
looked
at
him
do
you
think
that
arsène
lupin
is
the
kind
of
a
man
that
would
kill
himself
asked
sholmes
with
a
sneer
but
we
thought
we
recognized
him
outside
we
thought
so
because
the
wish
was
father
to
the
thought
that
man
has
us
bewitched
then
it
must
be
one
of
his
accomplices
the
accomplices
of
arsène
lupin
do
not
kill
themselves
well
then
who
is
it
they
searched
the
corpse
in
one
pocket
herlock
sholmes
found
an
empty
pocketbook
in
another
ganimard
found
several
louis
there
were
no
marks
of
identification
on
any
part
of
his
clothing
in
a
trunk
and
two
valises
they
found
nothing
but
wearing
apparel
on
the
mantel
there
was
a
pile
of
newspapers
ganimard
opened
them
all
of
them
contained
articles
referring
to
the
theft
of
the
jewish
lamp
an
hour
later
when
ganimard
and
sholmes
left
the
house
they
had
acquired
no
further
knowledge
of
the
strange
individual
who
had
been
driven
to
suicide
by
their
untimely
visit
who
was
he
why
had
he
killed
himself
what
was
his
connection
with
the
affair
of
the
jewish
lamp
who
had
followed
him
on
his
return
from
the
river
the
situation
involved
many
complex
questions
many
mysteries
herlock
sholmes
went
to
bed
in
a
very
bad
humor
early
next
morning
he
received
the
following
telephonic
message
arsène
lupin
has
the
honor
to
inform
you
of
his
tragic
death
in
the
person
of
monsieur
bresson
and
requests
the
honor
of
your
presence
at
the
funeral
service
and
burial
which
will
be
held
at
the
public
expense
on
thursday
june
chapter
viii
the
shipwreck
that
what
i
do
like
wilson
said
herlock
sholmes
after
he
had
read
arsène
lupin
message
that
is
what
exasperates
me
in
this
affair
to
feel
that
the
cunning
mocking
eye
of
that
fellow
follows
me
everywhere
he
sees
everything
he
knows
everything
he
reads
my
inmost
thoughts
he
even
foresees
my
slightest
movement
ah
he
is
possessed
of
a
marvellous
intuition
far
surpassing
that
of
the
most
instinctive
woman
yes
surpassing
even
that
of
herlock
sholmes
himself
nothing
escapes
him
i
resemble
an
actor
whose
every
step
and
movement
are
directed
by
a
who
says
this
and
does
that
in
obedience
to
a
superior
will
that
is
my
position
do
you
understand
wilson
certainly
wilson
would
have
understood
if
his
faculties
had
not
been
deadened
by
the
profound
slumber
of
a
man
whose
temperature
varies
between
one
hundred
and
one
hundred
and
three
degrees
but
whether
he
heard
or
not
was
a
matter
of
no
consequence
to
herlock
sholmes
who
continued
i
have
to
concentrate
all
my
energy
and
bring
all
my
resources
into
action
in
order
to
make
the
slightest
progress
and
fortunately
for
me
those
petty
annoyances
are
like
so
many
pricks
from
a
needle
and
serve
only
to
stimulate
me
as
soon
as
the
heat
of
the
wound
is
appeased
and
the
shock
to
my
vanity
has
subsided
i
say
to
myself
yourself
my
dear
fellow
but
remember
that
he
who
laughs
last
laughs
best
sooner
or
later
you
will
betray
yourself
for
you
know
wilson
it
was
lupin
himself
who
by
his
first
dispatch
and
the
observation
that
it
suggested
to
little
henriette
disclosed
to
me
the
secret
of
his
correspondence
with
alice
hemun
have
you
forgotten
that
circumstance
dear
boy
but
wilson
was
asleep
and
sholmes
pacing
to
and
fro
resumed
his
speech
and
now
things
are
not
in
a
bad
shape
a
little
obscure
perhaps
but
the
light
is
creeping
in
in
the
first
place
i
must
learn
all
about
monsieur
bresson
ganimard
and
i
will
visit
the
bank
of
the
river
at
the
spot
where
bresson
threw
away
the
package
and
the
particular
rôle
of
that
gentleman
will
be
known
to
me
after
that
the
game
will
be
played
between
me
and
alice
demun
rather
a
opponent
hein
wilson
and
do
you
not
think
that
i
will
soon
know
the
phrase
represented
by
the
letters
clipped
from
the
and
what
the
isolated
letters
the
and
the
mean
that
is
all
i
want
to
know
wilson
mademoiselle
entered
at
that
moment
and
observing
sholmes
gesticulating
she
said
in
her
sweetest
manner
monsieur
sholmes
i
must
scold
you
if
you
waken
my
patient
it
nice
of
you
to
disturb
him
the
doctor
has
ordered
absolute
rest
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
astonished
as
on
their
first
meeting
at
her
wonderful
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
monsieur
sholmes
you
seem
to
be
trying
to
read
my
thoughts
no
then
what
is
it
she
questioned
him
with
the
most
innocent
expression
on
her
pretty
face
and
in
her
frank
blue
eyes
a
smile
played
upon
her
lips
and
she
displayed
so
much
unaffected
candor
that
the
englishman
almost
lost
his
temper
he
approached
her
and
said
in
a
low
voice
bresson
killed
himself
last
night
she
affected
not
to
understand
him
so
he
repeated
bresson
killed
himself
yesterday
she
did
not
show
the
slightest
emotion
she
acted
as
if
the
matter
did
not
concern
or
interest
her
in
any
way
you
have
been
informed
said
sholmes
displaying
his
annoyance
otherwise
the
news
would
have
caused
you
to
start
at
least
ah
you
are
stronger
than
i
expected
but
what
the
use
of
your
trying
to
conceal
anything
from
me
he
picked
up
the
which
he
had
placed
on
a
convenient
table
and
opening
it
at
the
mutilated
page
said
will
you
tell
me
the
order
in
which
the
missing
letters
should
be
arranged
in
order
to
express
the
exact
wording
of
the
message
you
sent
to
bresson
four
days
before
the
theft
of
the
jewish
lamp
the
order
bresson
the
theft
of
the
jewish
lamp
she
repeated
the
words
slowly
as
if
trying
to
grasp
their
meaning
he
continued
yes
here
are
the
letters
employed
on
this
bit
of
paper
what
did
you
say
to
bresson
the
letters
employed
what
did
i
say
suddenly
she
burst
into
laughter
ah
that
is
it
i
understand
i
am
an
accomplice
in
the
crime
there
is
a
monsieur
bresson
who
stole
the
jewish
lamp
and
who
has
now
committed
suicide
and
i
am
the
friend
of
that
gentleman
oh
how
absurd
you
are
whom
did
you
go
to
see
last
night
on
the
second
floor
of
a
house
in
the
avenue
des
ternes
who
my
modiste
mademoiselle
langeais
do
you
suppose
that
my
modiste
and
my
friend
monsieur
bresson
are
the
same
person
despite
all
he
knew
sholmes
was
now
in
doubt
a
person
can
feign
terror
joy
anxiety
in
fact
all
emotions
but
a
person
can
not
feign
absolute
indifference
or
light
careless
laughter
yet
he
continued
to
question
her
why
did
you
accost
me
the
other
evening
at
the
northern
railway
station
and
why
did
you
entreat
me
to
leave
paris
immediately
without
investigating
this
theft
ah
you
are
too
inquisitive
monsieur
sholmes
she
replied
still
laughing
in
the
most
natural
manner
to
punish
you
i
will
tell
you
nothing
and
besides
you
must
watch
the
patient
while
i
go
to
the
pharmacy
on
an
urgent
message
au
revoir
she
left
the
room
i
am
beaten
by
a
girl
muttered
sholmes
not
only
did
i
get
nothing
out
of
her
but
i
exposed
my
hand
and
put
her
on
her
guard
and
he
recalled
the
affair
of
the
blue
diamond
and
his
first
interview
with
clotilde
destange
had
not
the
blonde
lady
met
his
question
with
the
same
unruffled
serenity
and
was
he
not
once
more
face
to
face
with
one
of
those
creatures
who
under
the
protection
and
influence
of
arsène
lupin
maintain
the
utmost
coolness
in
the
face
of
a
terrible
danger
sholmes
sholmes
it
was
wilson
who
called
him
sholmes
approached
the
bed
and
leaning
over
said
what
the
matter
wilson
does
your
wound
pain
you
wilson
lips
moved
but
he
could
not
speak
at
last
with
a
great
effort
he
stammered
no
sholmes
it
is
not
she
that
is
impossible
come
wilson
what
do
you
know
about
it
i
tell
you
that
it
is
she
it
is
only
when
i
meet
one
of
lupin
creatures
prepared
and
instructed
by
him
that
i
lose
my
head
and
make
a
fool
of
myself
i
bet
you
that
within
an
hour
lupin
will
know
all
about
our
interview
within
an
hour
what
am
i
saying
why
he
may
know
already
the
visit
to
the
pharmacy
urgent
message
all
nonsense
she
has
gone
to
telephone
to
lupin
sholmes
left
the
house
hurriedly
went
down
the
avenue
de
messine
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
mademoiselle
enter
a
pharmacy
ten
minutes
later
she
emerged
from
the
shop
carrying
some
small
packages
and
a
bottle
wrapped
in
white
paper
but
she
had
not
proceeded
far
when
she
was
accosted
by
a
man
who
with
hat
in
hand
and
an
obsequious
air
appeared
to
be
asking
for
charity
she
stopped
gave
him
something
and
proceeded
on
her
way
she
spoke
to
him
said
the
englishman
to
himself
if
not
a
certainty
it
was
at
least
an
intuition
and
quite
sufficient
to
cause
him
to
change
his
tactics
leaving
the
girl
to
pursue
her
own
course
he
followed
the
suspected
mendicant
who
walked
slowly
to
the
avenue
des
ternes
and
lingered
for
a
long
time
around
the
house
in
which
bresson
had
lived
sometimes
raising
his
eyes
to
the
windows
of
the
second
floor
and
watching
the
people
who
entered
the
house
at
the
end
of
an
hour
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
tramcar
going
in
the
direction
of
neuilly
sholmes
followed
and
took
a
seat
behind
the
man
and
beside
a
gentleman
who
was
concealed
behind
the
pages
of
a
newspaper
at
the
fortifications
the
gentleman
lowered
the
paper
and
sholmes
recognized
ganimard
who
thereupon
whispered
as
he
pointed
to
the
man
in
front
it
is
the
man
who
followed
bresson
last
night
he
has
been
watching
the
house
for
an
hour
anything
new
in
regard
to
bresson
asked
sholmes
yes
a
letter
came
to
his
address
this
morning
this
morning
then
it
was
posted
yesterday
before
the
sender
could
know
of
bresson
death
exactly
it
is
now
in
the
possession
of
the
examining
magistrate
but
i
read
it
it
says
will
not
accept
any
compromise
he
wants
everything
the
first
thing
as
well
as
those
of
the
second
affair
otherwise
he
will
there
is
no
signature
added
ganimard
it
seems
to
me
those
few
lines
wo
help
us
much
i
do
agree
with
you
monsieur
ganimard
to
me
those
few
lines
are
very
interesting
why
so
i
ca
see
it
for
reasons
that
are
personal
to
me
replied
sholmes
with
the
indifference
that
he
frequently
displayed
toward
his
colleague
the
tramcar
stopped
at
the
rue
de
château
which
was
the
terminus
the
man
descended
and
walked
away
quietly
sholmes
followed
at
so
short
a
distance
that
ganimard
protested
saying
if
he
should
turn
around
he
will
suspect
us
he
will
not
turn
around
how
do
you
know
he
is
an
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
and
the
fact
that
he
walks
in
that
manner
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
proves
in
the
first
place
that
he
knows
he
is
being
followed
and
in
the
second
place
that
he
is
not
afraid
but
i
think
we
are
keeping
too
close
to
him
not
too
close
to
prevent
his
slipping
through
our
fingers
he
is
too
sure
of
himself
ah
look
there
in
front
of
that
café
there
are
two
of
the
bicycle
police
if
i
summon
them
to
our
assistance
how
can
the
man
slip
through
our
fingers
well
our
friend
does
seem
to
be
worried
about
it
in
fact
he
is
asking
for
their
assistance
himself
mon
dieu
exclaimed
ganimard
he
has
a
nerve
the
man
approached
the
two
policemen
just
as
they
were
mounting
their
bicycles
after
a
few
words
with
them
he
leaped
on
a
third
bicycle
which
was
leaning
against
the
wall
of
the
café
and
rode
away
at
a
fast
pace
accompanied
by
the
two
policemen
hein
one
two
three
and
away
growled
sholmes
and
through
whose
agency
monsieur
ganimard
two
of
your
colleagues
ah
but
arsène
lupin
has
a
wonderful
organization
bicycle
policemen
in
his
service
i
told
you
our
man
was
too
calm
too
sure
of
himself
well
then
said
ganimard
quite
vexed
what
are
we
to
do
now
it
is
easy
enough
to
laugh
anyone
can
do
that
come
come
do
lose
your
temper
we
will
get
our
revenge
but
in
the
meantime
we
need
reinforcements
folenfant
is
waiting
for
me
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
de
neuilly
well
go
and
get
him
and
join
me
later
i
will
follow
our
fugitive
sholmes
followed
the
bicycle
tracks
which
were
plainly
visible
in
the
dust
of
the
road
as
two
of
the
machines
were
furnished
with
striated
tires
very
soon
he
ascertained
that
the
tracks
were
leading
him
to
the
edge
of
the
seine
and
that
the
three
men
had
turned
in
the
direction
taken
by
bresson
on
the
preceding
evening
thus
he
arrived
at
the
gateway
where
he
and
ganimard
had
concealed
themselves
and
a
little
farther
on
he
discovered
a
mingling
of
the
bicycle
tracks
which
showed
that
the
men
had
halted
at
that
spot
directly
opposite
there
was
a
little
point
of
land
which
projected
into
the
river
and
at
the
extremity
thereof
an
old
boat
was
moored
it
was
there
that
bresson
had
thrown
away
the
package
or
rather
had
dropped
it
sholmes
descended
the
bank
and
saw
that
the
declivity
was
not
steep
and
the
water
quite
shallow
so
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
recover
the
package
provided
the
three
men
had
not
forestalled
him
no
that
ca
be
he
thought
they
have
not
had
time
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
the
most
and
yet
why
did
they
come
this
way
a
fisherman
was
seated
on
the
old
boat
sholmes
asked
him
did
you
see
three
men
on
bicycles
a
few
minutes
ago
the
fisherman
made
a
negative
gesture
but
sholmes
insisted
three
men
who
stopped
on
the
road
just
on
top
of
the
bank
the
fisherman
rested
his
pole
under
his
arm
took
a
memorandum
book
from
his
pocket
wrote
on
one
of
the
pages
tore
it
out
and
handed
it
to
sholmes
the
englishman
gave
a
start
of
surprise
in
the
middle
of
the
paper
which
he
held
in
his
hand
he
saw
the
series
of
letters
cut
from
the
cdehnoprzeo
the
man
resumed
his
fishing
sheltered
from
the
sun
by
a
large
straw
hat
with
his
coat
and
vest
lying
beside
him
he
was
intently
watching
the
cork
attached
to
his
line
as
it
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
water
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
solemn
and
terrible
is
it
he
conjectured
sholmes
with
an
anxiety
that
was
almost
pitiful
then
the
truth
burst
upon
him
it
is
he
it
is
he
no
one
else
could
remain
there
so
calmly
without
the
slightest
display
of
anxiety
without
the
least
fear
of
what
might
happen
and
who
else
would
know
the
story
of
those
mysterious
letters
alice
had
warned
him
by
means
of
her
messenger
suddenly
the
englishman
felt
that
his
hand
that
his
own
hand
had
involuntarily
seized
the
handle
of
his
revolver
and
that
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
man
back
a
little
below
the
neck
one
movement
and
the
drama
would
be
finished
the
life
of
the
strange
adventurer
would
come
to
a
miserable
end
the
fisherman
did
not
stir
sholmes
nervously
toyed
with
his
revolver
and
experienced
a
wild
desire
to
fire
it
and
end
everything
but
the
horror
of
such
an
act
was
repugnant
to
his
nature
death
would
be
certain
and
would
end
all
ah
he
thought
let
him
get
up
and
defend
himself
if
he
does
so
much
the
worse
for
him
one
second
more
and
i
fire
but
a
sound
of
footsteps
behind
him
caused
him
to
turn
his
head
it
was
ganimard
coming
with
some
assistants
then
quickly
changing
his
plans
sholmes
leaped
into
the
boat
which
was
broken
from
its
moorings
by
his
sudden
action
he
pounced
upon
the
man
and
seized
him
around
the
body
they
rolled
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
together
well
now
exclaimed
lupin
struggling
to
free
himself
what
does
this
mean
when
one
of
us
has
conquered
the
other
what
good
will
it
do
you
will
not
know
what
to
do
with
me
nor
i
with
you
we
will
remain
here
like
two
idiots
the
two
oars
slipped
into
the
water
the
boat
drifted
into
the
stream
good
lord
what
a
fuss
you
make
a
man
of
your
age
ought
to
know
better
you
act
like
a
child
lupin
succeeded
in
freeing
himself
from
the
grasp
of
the
detective
who
thoroughly
exasperated
and
ready
to
kill
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
he
uttered
an
oath
lupin
had
taken
his
revolver
then
he
knelt
down
and
tried
to
capture
one
of
the
lost
oars
in
order
to
regain
the
shore
while
lupin
was
trying
to
capture
the
other
oar
in
order
to
drive
the
boat
down
the
river
it
gone
i
ca
reach
it
said
lupin
but
it
of
no
consequence
if
you
get
your
oar
i
can
prevent
your
using
it
and
you
could
do
the
same
to
me
but
you
see
that
is
the
way
in
this
world
we
act
without
any
purpose
or
reason
as
our
efforts
are
in
vain
since
fate
decides
everything
now
do
you
see
fate
is
on
the
side
of
his
friend
lupin
the
game
is
mine
the
current
favors
me
the
boat
was
slowly
drifting
down
the
river
look
out
cried
lupin
quickly
someone
on
the
bank
was
pointing
a
revolver
lupin
stooped
a
shot
was
fired
it
struck
the
water
beyond
the
boat
lupin
burst
into
laughter
god
bless
me
it
my
friend
ganimard
but
it
was
very
wrong
of
you
to
do
that
ganimard
you
have
no
right
to
shoot
except
in
does
poor
lupin
worry
you
so
much
that
you
forget
yourself
now
be
good
and
do
shoot
again
if
you
do
you
will
hit
our
english
friend
he
stood
behind
sholmes
facing
ganimard
and
said
now
ganimard
i
am
ready
aim
for
his
heart
higher
a
little
to
the
left
ah
you
missed
that
time
deuced
bad
shot
try
again
your
hand
shakes
ganimard
now
once
more
one
two
three
fire
missed
parbleu
the
authorities
furnish
you
with
lupin
drew
a
long
revolver
and
fired
without
taking
aim
ganimard
put
his
hand
to
his
hat
the
bullet
had
passed
through
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
ganimard
ah
that
a
real
revolver
a
genuine
english
bulldog
it
belongs
to
my
friend
herlock
sholmes
and
with
a
laugh
he
threw
the
revolver
to
the
shore
where
it
landed
at
ganimard
feet
sholmes
could
not
withhold
a
smile
of
admiration
what
a
torrent
of
youthful
spirits
and
how
he
seemed
to
enjoy
himself
it
appeared
as
if
the
sensation
of
peril
caused
him
a
physical
pleasure
and
this
extraordinary
man
had
no
other
purpose
in
life
than
to
seek
for
dangers
simply
for
the
amusement
it
afforded
him
in
avoiding
them
many
people
had
now
gathered
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
ganimard
and
his
men
followed
the
boat
as
it
slowly
floated
down
the
stream
lupin
capture
was
a
mathematical
certainty
confess
old
fellow
said
lupin
turning
to
the
englishman
that
you
would
not
exchange
your
present
position
for
all
the
gold
in
the
transvaal
you
are
now
in
the
first
row
of
the
orchestra
chairs
but
in
the
first
place
we
must
have
the
prologue
after
which
we
can
leap
at
one
bound
to
the
fifth
act
of
the
drama
which
will
represent
the
capture
or
escape
of
arsène
lupin
therefore
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
plain
question
to
which
i
request
a
plain
answer
a
simple
yes
or
no
will
you
renounce
this
affair
at
present
i
can
repair
the
damage
you
have
done
later
it
will
be
beyond
my
power
is
it
a
bargain
no
lupin
face
showed
his
disappointment
and
annoyance
he
continued
i
insist
more
for
your
sake
than
my
own
i
insist
because
i
am
certain
you
will
be
the
first
to
regret
your
intervention
for
the
last
time
yes
or
no
no
lupin
stooped
down
removed
one
of
the
boards
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
for
some
minutes
was
engaged
in
a
work
the
nature
of
which
sholmes
could
not
discern
then
he
arose
seated
himself
beside
the
englishman
and
said
i
believe
monsieur
that
we
came
to
the
river
for
the
same
purpose
to
recover
the
object
which
bresson
threw
away
for
my
part
i
had
invited
a
few
friends
to
join
me
here
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
making
an
examination
of
the
bed
of
the
river
when
my
friends
announced
your
approach
i
confess
that
the
news
did
not
surprise
me
as
i
have
been
notified
every
hour
concerning
the
progress
of
your
investigation
that
was
an
easy
matter
whenever
anything
occurred
in
the
rue
murillo
that
might
interest
me
simply
a
ring
on
the
telephone
and
i
was
informed
he
stopped
the
board
that
he
had
displaced
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
was
rising
and
water
was
working
into
the
boat
all
around
it
the
deuce
i
did
know
how
to
fix
it
i
was
afraid
this
old
boat
would
leak
you
are
not
afraid
monsieur
sholmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
lupin
continued
you
will
understand
then
in
those
circumstances
and
knowing
in
advance
that
you
would
be
more
eager
to
seek
a
battle
than
i
would
be
to
avoid
it
i
assure
you
i
was
not
entirely
displeased
to
enter
into
a
contest
of
which
the
issue
is
quite
certain
since
i
hold
all
the
trump
cards
in
my
hand
and
i
desired
that
our
meeting
should
be
given
the
widest
publicity
in
order
that
your
defeat
may
be
universally
known
so
that
another
countess
de
crozon
or
another
baron
may
not
be
tempted
to
solicit
your
aid
against
me
besides
my
dear
monsieur
he
stopped
again
and
using
his
hands
as
a
lorgnette
he
scanned
the
banks
of
the
river
mon
dieu
they
have
chartered
a
superb
boat
a
real
and
see
how
they
are
rowing
in
five
minutes
they
will
be
and
i
am
lost
monsieur
sholmes
a
word
of
advice
you
seize
me
bind
me
and
deliver
me
to
the
officers
of
the
law
does
that
programme
please
you
unless
in
the
meantime
we
are
shipwrecked
in
which
event
we
can
do
nothing
but
prepare
our
wills
what
do
you
think
they
exchanged
looks
sholmes
now
understood
lupin
scheme
he
had
scuttled
the
boat
and
the
water
was
rising
it
had
reached
the
soles
of
their
boots
then
it
covered
their
feet
but
they
did
not
move
it
was
to
their
knees
the
englishman
took
out
his
tobacco
rolled
a
cigarette
and
lighted
it
lupin
continued
to
talk
but
do
not
regard
that
offer
as
a
confession
of
my
weakness
i
surrender
to
you
in
a
battle
in
which
i
can
achieve
a
victory
in
order
to
avoid
a
struggle
upon
a
field
not
of
my
own
choosing
in
so
doing
i
recognize
the
fact
that
sholmes
is
the
only
enemy
i
fear
and
announce
my
anxiety
that
sholmes
will
not
be
diverted
from
my
track
i
take
this
opportunity
to
tell
you
these
things
since
fate
has
accorded
me
the
honor
of
a
conversation
with
you
i
have
only
one
regret
it
is
that
our
conversation
should
have
occurred
while
we
are
taking
a
a
situation
that
is
lacking
in
dignity
i
must
confess
what
did
i
say
a
it
is
worse
than
that
the
water
had
reached
the
board
on
which
they
were
sitting
and
the
boat
was
gradually
sinking
sholmes
smoking
his
cigarette
appeared
to
be
calmly
admiring
the
scenery
for
nothing
in
the
world
while
face
to
face
with
that
man
who
while
threatened
by
dangers
surrounded
by
a
crowd
followed
by
a
posse
of
police
maintained
his
equanimity
and
good
humor
for
nothing
in
the
world
would
he
sholmes
display
the
slightest
sign
of
nervousness
each
of
them
looked
as
if
he
might
say
should
a
person
be
disturbed
by
such
trifles
are
not
people
drowned
in
a
river
every
day
is
it
such
an
unusual
event
as
to
deserve
special
attention
one
chatted
whilst
the
other
dreamed
both
concealing
their
wounded
pride
beneath
a
mask
of
indifference
one
minute
more
and
the
boat
will
sink
lupin
continued
his
chatter
the
important
thing
to
know
is
whether
we
will
sink
before
or
after
the
arrival
of
the
champions
of
the
law
that
is
the
main
question
as
to
our
shipwreck
that
is
a
conclusion
now
monsieur
the
hour
has
come
in
which
we
must
make
our
wills
i
give
devise
and
bequeath
all
my
property
to
herlock
sholmes
a
citizen
of
england
for
his
own
use
and
benefit
but
mon
dieu
how
quickly
the
champions
of
the
law
are
approaching
ah
the
brave
fellows
it
is
a
pleasure
to
watch
them
observe
the
precision
of
the
oars
ah
is
it
you
brigadier
folenfant
bravo
the
idea
of
a
is
an
excellent
one
i
commend
you
to
your
superiors
brigadier
folenfant
do
you
wish
a
medal
you
shall
have
it
and
your
comrade
dieuzy
where
is
he
ah
yes
i
think
i
see
him
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
at
the
head
of
a
hundred
natives
so
that
if
i
escape
shipwreck
i
shall
be
captured
on
the
left
by
dieuzy
and
his
natives
or
on
the
right
by
ganimard
and
the
populace
of
neuilly
an
embarrassing
dilemma
the
boat
entered
an
eddy
it
swung
around
and
sholmes
caught
hold
of
the
oarlocks
lupin
said
to
him
monsieur
you
should
remove
your
coat
you
will
find
it
easier
to
swim
without
a
coat
no
you
refuse
then
i
shall
put
on
my
own
he
donned
his
coat
buttoned
it
closely
the
same
as
sholmes
and
said
what
a
discourteous
man
you
are
and
what
a
pity
that
you
should
be
so
stubborn
in
this
affair
in
which
of
course
you
display
your
strength
but
oh
so
vainly
really
you
mar
your
genius
monsieur
lupin
interrupted
sholmes
emerging
from
his
silence
you
talk
too
much
and
you
frequently
err
through
excess
of
confidence
and
through
your
frivolity
that
is
a
severe
reproach
thus
without
knowing
it
you
furnished
me
only
a
moment
ago
with
the
information
i
required
what
you
required
some
information
and
you
did
tell
me
i
had
no
occasion
to
ask
you
for
it
you
volunteered
it
within
three
hours
i
can
deliver
the
key
of
the
mystery
to
monsieur
that
is
the
only
reply
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
the
boat
suddenly
sank
taking
both
of
the
men
down
with
it
it
emerged
immediately
with
its
keel
in
the
air
shouts
were
heard
on
either
bank
succeeded
by
an
anxious
moment
of
silence
then
the
shouts
were
renewed
one
of
the
shipwrecked
party
had
come
to
the
surface
it
was
herlock
sholmes
he
was
an
excellent
swimmer
and
struck
out
with
powerful
strokes
for
folenfant
boat
courage
monsieur
sholmes
shouted
folenfant
we
are
here
keep
it
up
we
will
get
you
a
little
more
monsieur
sholmes
catch
the
rope
the
englishman
seized
the
rope
they
had
thrown
to
him
but
while
they
were
hauling
him
into
the
boat
he
heard
a
voice
behind
him
saying
the
key
of
the
mystery
monsieur
yes
you
shall
have
it
i
am
astonished
that
you
have
got
it
already
what
then
what
good
will
it
do
you
by
that
time
you
will
have
lost
the
battle
now
comfortably
installed
astride
the
keel
of
the
boat
lupin
continued
his
speech
with
solemn
gestures
as
if
he
hoped
to
convince
his
adversary
you
must
understand
my
dear
sholmes
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
absolutely
nothing
you
find
yourself
in
the
deplorable
position
of
a
gentleman
surrender
lupin
shouted
folenfant
you
are
an
fellow
folenfant
to
interrupt
me
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
i
was
saying
surrender
lupin
oh
parbleu
brigadier
folenfant
a
man
surrenders
only
when
he
is
in
danger
surely
you
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
i
am
in
any
danger
for
the
last
time
lupin
i
call
on
you
to
surrender
brigadier
folenfant
you
have
no
intention
of
killing
me
you
may
wish
to
wound
me
since
you
are
afraid
i
may
escape
but
if
by
chance
the
wound
prove
mortal
just
think
of
your
remorse
it
would
embitter
your
old
age
the
shot
was
fired
lupin
staggered
clutched
at
the
keel
of
the
boat
for
a
moment
then
let
go
and
disappeared
it
was
exactly
three
when
the
foregoing
events
transpired
precisely
at
six
as
he
had
foretold
herlock
sholmes
dressed
in
trousers
that
were
too
short
and
a
coat
that
was
too
small
which
he
had
borrowed
from
an
innkeeper
at
neuilly
wearing
a
cap
and
a
flannel
shirt
entered
the
boudoir
in
the
rue
murillo
after
having
sent
word
to
monsieur
and
madame
that
he
desired
an
interview
they
found
him
walking
up
and
down
the
room
and
he
looked
so
ludicrous
in
his
strange
costume
that
they
could
scarcely
suppress
their
mirth
with
pensive
air
and
stooped
shoulders
he
walked
like
an
automaton
from
the
window
to
the
door
and
from
the
door
to
the
window
taking
each
time
the
same
number
of
steps
and
turning
each
time
in
the
same
manner
he
stopped
picked
up
a
small
ornament
examined
it
mechanically
and
resumed
his
walk
at
last
planting
himself
before
them
he
asked
is
mademoiselle
here
yes
she
is
in
the
garden
with
the
children
i
wish
mademoiselle
to
be
present
at
this
interview
is
it
necessary
have
a
little
patience
monsieur
from
the
facts
i
am
going
to
present
to
you
you
will
see
the
necessity
for
her
presence
here
very
well
suzanne
will
you
call
her
madame
arose
went
out
and
returned
almost
immediately
accompanied
by
alice
demun
mademoiselle
who
was
a
trifle
paler
than
usual
remained
standing
leaning
against
a
table
and
without
even
asking
why
she
had
been
called
sholmes
did
not
look
at
her
but
suddenly
turning
toward
monsieur
he
said
in
a
tone
which
did
not
admit
of
a
reply
after
several
days
investigation
monsieur
i
must
repeat
what
i
told
you
when
i
first
came
here
the
jewish
lamp
was
stolen
by
some
one
living
in
the
house
the
name
of
the
guilty
party
i
know
it
your
proof
i
have
sufficient
to
establish
that
fact
but
we
require
more
than
that
we
desire
the
restoration
of
the
stolen
goods
the
jewish
lamp
it
is
in
my
possession
the
opal
necklace
the
the
opal
necklace
the
and
all
the
goods
stolen
on
the
second
occasion
are
in
my
possession
sholmes
delighted
in
these
dramatic
dialogues
and
it
pleased
him
to
announce
his
victories
in
that
curt
manner
the
baron
and
his
wife
were
amazed
and
looked
at
sholmes
with
a
silent
curiosity
which
was
the
highest
praise
he
related
to
them
very
minutely
what
he
had
done
during
those
three
days
he
told
of
his
discovery
of
the
alphabet
book
wrote
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
the
sentence
formed
by
the
missing
letters
then
related
the
journey
of
bresson
to
the
bank
of
the
river
and
the
suicide
of
the
adventurer
and
finally
his
struggle
with
lupin
the
shipwreck
and
the
disappearance
of
lupin
when
he
had
finished
the
baron
said
in
a
low
voice
now
you
have
told
us
everything
except
the
name
of
the
guilty
party
whom
do
you
accuse
i
accuse
the
person
who
cut
the
letters
from
the
alphabet
book
and
communicated
with
arsène
lupin
by
means
of
those
letters
how
do
you
know
that
such
correspondence
was
carried
on
with
arsène
lupin
my
information
comes
from
lupin
himself
he
produced
a
piece
of
paper
that
was
wet
and
crumpled
it
was
the
page
which
lupin
had
torn
from
his
and
upon
which
he
had
written
the
phrase
and
you
will
notice
said
sholmes
with
satisfaction
that
he
was
not
obliged
to
give
me
that
sheet
of
paper
and
in
that
way
disclose
his
identity
simple
childishness
on
his
part
and
yet
it
gave
me
exactly
the
information
i
desired
what
was
it
asked
the
baron
i
do
understand
sholmes
took
a
pencil
and
made
a
fresh
copy
of
the
letters
and
figures
cdehnoprzeo
well
said
the
baron
it
is
the
formula
you
showed
me
yourself
no
if
you
had
turned
and
returned
that
formula
in
every
way
as
i
have
done
you
would
have
seen
at
first
glance
that
this
formula
is
not
like
the
first
one
in
what
respect
do
they
differ
this
one
has
two
more
letters
an
e
and
an
o
really
i
had
noticed
that
join
those
two
letters
to
the
c
and
the
h
which
remained
after
forming
the
word
and
you
will
agree
with
me
that
the
only
possible
word
is
echo
what
does
that
mean
it
refers
to
the
de
lupin
newspaper
his
official
organ
the
one
in
which
he
publishes
his
communications
reply
in
the
de
in
the
personal
advertisements
under
number
that
is
the
key
to
the
mystery
and
arsène
lupin
was
kind
enough
to
furnish
it
to
me
i
went
to
the
newspaper
office
what
did
you
find
there
i
found
the
entire
story
of
the
relations
between
arsène
lupin
and
his
accomplice
sholmes
produced
seven
newspapers
which
he
opened
at
the
fourth
page
and
pointed
to
the
following
lines
ars
lup
lady
implores
protection
awaiting
particulars
under
domin
enemy
lost
write
address
will
make
investigation
murillo
park
three
violets
understand
sat
will
be
sun
morn
park
and
you
call
that
the
whole
story
exclaimed
the
baron
yes
and
if
you
will
listen
to
me
for
a
few
minutes
i
think
i
can
convince
you
in
the
first
place
a
lady
who
signs
herself
implores
the
protection
of
arsène
lupin
who
replies
by
asking
for
particulars
the
lady
replies
that
she
is
under
the
domination
of
an
enemy
who
is
bresson
no
doubt
and
that
she
is
lost
if
some
one
does
not
come
to
her
assistance
lupin
is
suspicious
and
does
not
yet
venture
to
appoint
an
interview
with
the
unknown
woman
demands
the
address
and
proposes
to
make
an
investigation
the
lady
hesitates
for
four
days
look
at
the
dates
finally
under
stress
of
circumstances
and
influenced
by
bresson
threats
she
gives
the
name
of
the
street
murillo
next
day
arsène
lupin
announces
that
he
will
be
in
the
park
monceau
at
three
and
asks
his
unknown
correspondent
to
wear
a
bouquet
of
violets
as
a
means
of
identification
then
there
is
a
lapse
of
eight
days
in
the
correspondence
arsène
lupin
and
the
lady
do
not
require
to
correspond
through
the
newspaper
now
as
they
see
each
other
or
write
directly
the
scheme
is
arranged
in
this
way
in
order
to
satisfy
bresson
demands
the
lady
is
to
carry
off
the
jewish
lamp
the
date
is
not
yet
fixed
the
lady
who
as
a
matter
of
prudence
corresponds
by
means
of
letters
cut
out
of
a
book
decides
on
saturday
and
adds
echo
lupin
replies
that
it
is
understood
and
that
he
will
be
in
the
park
on
sunday
morning
sunday
morning
the
theft
takes
place
really
that
is
an
excellent
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
and
every
link
is
complete
said
the
baron
the
theft
has
taken
place
continued
sholmes
the
lady
goes
out
on
sunday
morning
tells
lupin
what
she
has
done
and
carries
the
jewish
lamp
to
bresson
everything
occurs
then
exactly
as
lupin
had
foreseen
the
officers
of
the
law
deceived
by
an
open
window
four
holes
in
the
ground
and
two
scratches
on
the
balcony
railing
immediately
advance
the
theory
that
the
theft
was
committed
by
a
burglar
the
lady
is
safe
yes
i
confess
the
theory
was
a
logical
one
said
the
baron
but
the
second
theft
the
second
theft
was
provoked
by
the
first
the
newspapers
having
related
how
the
jewish
lamp
had
disappeared
some
one
conceived
the
idea
of
repeating
the
crime
and
carrying
away
what
had
been
left
this
time
it
was
not
a
simulated
theft
but
a
real
one
a
genuine
burglary
with
ladders
and
other
paraphernalia
lupin
of
course
no
lupin
does
not
act
so
stupidly
he
does
fire
at
people
for
trifling
reasons
then
who
was
it
bresson
no
doubt
and
unknown
to
the
lady
whom
he
had
menaced
it
was
bresson
who
entered
here
it
was
bresson
that
i
pursued
it
was
bresson
who
wounded
poor
wilson
are
you
sure
of
it
absolutely
one
of
bresson
accomplices
wrote
to
him
yesterday
before
his
suicide
a
letter
which
proves
that
negotiations
were
pending
between
this
accomplice
and
lupin
for
the
restitution
of
all
the
articles
stolen
from
your
house
lupin
demanded
everything
first
that
is
the
jewish
lamp
well
as
those
of
the
second
moreover
he
was
watching
bresson
when
the
latter
returned
from
the
river
last
night
one
of
lupin
men
followed
him
as
well
as
we
what
was
bresson
doing
at
the
river
having
been
warned
of
the
progress
of
my
investigations
warned
by
whom
by
the
same
lady
who
justly
feared
that
the
discovery
of
the
jewish
lamp
would
lead
to
the
discovery
of
her
own
adventure
thereupon
bresson
having
been
warned
made
into
a
package
all
the
things
that
could
compromise
him
and
threw
them
into
a
place
where
he
thought
he
could
get
them
again
when
the
danger
was
past
it
was
after
his
return
tracked
by
ganimard
and
myself
having
no
doubt
other
sins
on
his
conscience
that
he
lost
his
head
and
killed
himself
but
what
did
the
package
contain
the
jewish
lamp
and
your
other
ornaments
then
they
are
not
in
your
possession
immediately
after
lupin
disappearance
i
profited
by
the
bath
he
had
forced
upon
me
went
to
the
spot
selected
by
bresson
where
i
found
the
stolen
articles
wrapped
in
some
soiled
linen
they
are
there
on
the
table
without
a
word
the
baron
cut
the
cord
tore
open
the
wet
linen
picked
out
the
lamp
turned
a
screw
in
the
foot
then
divided
the
bowl
of
the
lamp
which
opened
in
two
equal
parts
and
there
he
found
the
golden
chimera
set
with
rubies
and
emeralds
it
was
intact
there
was
in
that
scene
so
natural
in
appearance
and
which
consisted
of
a
simple
exposition
of
facts
something
which
rendered
it
frightfully
tragic
it
was
the
formal
direct
irrefutable
accusation
that
sholmes
launched
in
each
of
his
words
against
mademoiselle
and
it
was
also
the
impressive
silence
of
alice
demun
during
that
long
cruel
accumulation
of
accusing
circumstances
heaped
one
upon
another
not
a
muscle
of
her
face
had
moved
not
a
trace
of
revolt
or
fear
had
marred
the
serenity
of
her
limpid
eyes
what
were
her
thoughts
and
especially
what
was
she
going
to
say
at
the
solemn
moment
when
it
would
become
necessary
for
her
to
speak
and
defend
herself
in
order
to
break
the
chain
of
evidence
that
herlock
sholmes
had
so
cleverly
woven
around
her
that
moment
had
come
but
the
girl
was
silent
speak
speak
cried
mon
she
did
not
speak
so
he
insisted
one
word
will
clear
you
one
word
of
denial
and
i
will
believe
you
that
word
she
would
not
utter
the
baron
paced
to
and
fro
in
his
excitement
then
addressing
sholmes
he
said
no
monsieur
i
can
not
believe
it
i
do
not
believe
it
there
are
impossible
crimes
and
this
is
opposed
to
all
i
know
and
to
all
that
i
have
seen
during
the
past
year
no
i
can
not
believe
it
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
englishman
shoulder
and
said
but
you
yourself
monsieur
are
you
absolutely
certain
that
you
are
right
sholmes
hesitated
like
a
man
on
whom
a
sudden
demand
is
made
and
can
not
frame
an
immediate
reply
then
he
smiled
and
said
only
the
person
whom
i
accuse
by
reason
of
her
situation
in
your
house
could
know
that
the
jewish
lamp
contained
that
magnificent
jewel
i
can
not
believe
it
repeated
the
baron
ask
her
it
was
really
the
very
thing
he
would
not
have
done
blinded
by
the
confidence
the
girl
had
inspired
in
him
but
he
could
no
longer
refrain
from
doing
it
he
approached
her
and
looking
into
her
eyes
said
was
it
you
mademoiselle
was
it
you
who
took
the
jewel
was
it
you
who
corresponded
with
arsène
lupin
and
committed
the
theft
it
was
i
monsieur
she
replied
she
did
not
drop
her
head
her
face
displayed
no
sign
of
shame
or
fear
is
it
possible
murmured
mon
i
would
never
have
believed
it
you
are
the
last
person
in
the
world
that
i
would
have
suspected
how
did
you
do
it
i
did
it
exactly
as
monsieur
sholmes
has
told
it
on
saturday
night
i
came
to
the
boudoir
took
the
lamp
and
in
the
morning
i
carried
it
to
that
man
no
said
the
baron
what
you
pretend
to
have
done
is
impossible
impossible
why
because
in
the
morning
i
found
the
door
of
the
boudoir
bolted
she
blushed
and
looked
at
sholmes
as
if
seeking
his
counsel
sholmes
was
astonished
at
her
embarrassment
had
she
nothing
to
say
did
the
confessions
which
had
corroborated
the
report
that
he
sholmes
had
made
concerning
the
theft
of
the
jewish
lamp
merely
serve
to
mask
a
lie
was
she
misleading
them
by
a
false
confession
the
baron
continued
that
door
was
locked
i
found
the
door
exactly
as
i
had
left
it
the
night
before
if
you
entered
by
that
door
as
you
pretend
some
one
must
have
opened
it
from
the
interior
that
is
to
say
from
the
boudoir
or
from
our
chamber
now
there
was
no
one
inside
these
two
rooms
there
was
no
one
except
my
wife
and
myself
sholmes
bowed
his
head
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
in
order
to
conceal
his
emotion
a
sudden
light
had
entered
his
mind
that
startled
him
and
made
him
exceedingly
uncomfortable
everything
was
revealed
to
him
like
the
sudden
lifting
of
a
fog
from
the
morning
landscape
he
was
annoyed
as
well
as
ashamed
because
his
deductions
were
fallacious
and
his
entire
theory
was
wrong
alice
demun
was
innocent
alice
demun
was
innocent
that
proposition
explained
the
embarrassment
he
had
experienced
from
the
beginning
in
directing
the
terrible
accusation
against
that
young
girl
now
he
saw
the
truth
he
knew
it
after
a
few
seconds
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
madame
as
naturally
as
he
could
she
was
pale
with
that
unusual
pallor
which
invades
us
in
the
relentless
moments
of
our
lives
her
hands
which
she
endeavored
to
conceal
were
trembling
as
if
stricken
with
palsy
one
minute
more
thought
sholmes
and
she
will
betray
herself
he
placed
himself
between
her
and
her
husband
in
the
desire
to
avert
the
awful
danger
which
his
now
threatened
that
man
and
woman
but
at
sight
of
the
baron
he
was
shocked
to
the
very
centre
of
his
soul
the
same
dreadful
idea
had
entered
the
mind
of
monsieur
the
same
thought
was
at
work
in
the
brain
of
the
husband
he
understood
also
he
saw
the
truth
in
desperation
alice
demun
hurled
herself
against
the
implacable
truth
saying
you
are
right
monsieur
i
made
a
mistake
i
did
not
enter
by
this
door
i
came
through
the
garden
and
the
vestibule
by
aid
of
a
ladder
it
was
a
supreme
effort
of
true
devotion
but
a
useless
effort
the
words
rang
false
the
voice
did
not
carry
conviction
and
the
poor
girl
no
longer
displayed
those
clear
fearless
eyes
and
that
natural
air
of
innocence
which
had
served
her
so
well
now
she
bowed
her
head
vanquished
the
silence
became
painful
madame
was
waiting
for
her
husband
next
move
overwhelmed
with
anxiety
and
fear
the
baron
appeared
to
be
struggling
against
the
dreadful
suspicion
as
if
he
would
not
submit
to
the
overthrow
of
his
happiness
finally
he
said
to
his
wife
speak
explain
i
have
nothing
to
tell
you
she
replied
in
a
very
low
voice
and
with
features
drawn
by
anguish
so
then
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
saved
me
through
devotion
through
affection
and
accused
herself
saved
you
from
what
from
whom
from
that
man
bresson
yes
it
was
i
whom
he
held
in
fear
by
threats
i
met
him
at
one
of
my
friends
and
i
was
foolish
enough
to
listen
to
him
oh
there
was
nothing
that
you
can
not
pardon
but
i
wrote
him
two
letters
letters
which
you
will
see
i
had
to
buy
them
back
you
know
how
oh
have
pity
on
me
i
have
suffered
so
much
you
you
suzanne
he
raised
his
clenched
fists
ready
to
strike
her
ready
to
kill
her
but
he
dropped
his
arms
and
murmured
you
suzanne
you
is
it
possible
by
short
detached
sentences
she
related
the
heartrending
story
her
dreadful
awakening
to
the
infamy
of
the
man
her
remorse
her
fear
and
she
also
told
of
alice
devotion
how
the
young
girl
divined
the
sorrow
of
her
mistress
wormed
a
confession
out
of
her
wrote
to
lupin
and
devised
the
scheme
of
the
theft
in
order
to
save
her
from
bresson
you
suzanne
you
repeated
monsieur
bowed
with
grief
and
shame
how
could
you
on
the
same
evening
the
steamer
city
of
london
which
plies
between
calais
and
dover
was
gliding
slowly
over
the
smooth
sea
the
night
was
dark
the
wind
was
fainter
than
a
zephyr
the
majority
of
the
passengers
had
retired
to
their
cabins
but
a
few
more
intrepid
were
promenading
on
the
deck
or
sleeping
in
large
wrapped
in
their
one
could
see
here
and
there
the
light
of
a
cigar
and
one
could
hear
mingled
with
the
soft
murmur
of
the
breeze
the
faint
sound
of
voices
which
were
carefully
subdued
to
harmonize
with
the
deep
silence
of
the
night
one
of
the
passengers
who
had
been
pacing
to
and
fro
upon
the
deck
stopped
before
a
woman
who
was
lying
on
a
bench
scrutinized
her
and
when
she
moved
a
little
he
said
i
thought
you
were
asleep
mademoiselle
alice
no
monsieur
sholmes
i
am
not
sleepy
i
was
thinking
of
what
if
i
may
be
so
bold
as
to
inquire
i
was
thinking
of
madame
she
must
be
very
unhappy
her
life
is
ruined
oh
no
no
he
replied
quickly
her
mistake
was
not
a
serious
one
monsieur
will
forgive
and
forget
it
why
even
before
we
left
his
manner
toward
her
had
softened
perhaps
but
he
will
remember
it
for
a
long
time
and
she
will
suffer
a
great
deal
you
love
her
very
much
it
was
my
love
for
her
that
gave
me
strength
to
smile
when
i
was
trembling
from
fear
that
gave
me
courage
to
look
in
your
face
when
i
desired
to
hide
from
your
sight
and
you
are
sorry
to
leave
her
yes
very
sorry
i
have
no
relatives
no
friends
but
her
you
will
have
friends
said
the
englishman
who
was
affected
by
her
sorrow
i
have
promised
that
i
have
relatives
and
some
influence
i
assure
you
that
you
will
have
no
cause
to
regret
coming
to
england
that
may
be
monsieur
but
madame
will
not
be
there
herlock
sholmes
resumed
his
promenade
upon
the
deck
after
a
few
minutes
he
took
a
seat
near
his
travelling
companion
filled
his
pipe
and
struck
four
matches
in
a
vain
effort
to
light
it
then
as
he
had
no
more
matches
he
arose
and
said
to
a
gentleman
who
was
sitting
near
him
may
i
trouble
you
for
a
match
the
gentleman
opened
a
box
of
matches
and
struck
one
the
flame
lighted
up
his
face
sholmes
recognized
him
it
was
arsène
lupin
if
the
englishman
had
not
given
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
of
surprise
lupin
would
have
supposed
that
his
presence
on
board
had
been
known
to
sholmes
so
well
did
he
control
his
feelings
and
so
natural
was
the
easy
manner
in
which
he
extended
his
hand
to
his
adversary
how
the
good
health
monsieur
lupin
bravo
exclaimed
lupin
who
could
not
repress
a
cry
of
admiration
at
the
englishman
bravo
and
why
why
because
i
appear
before
you
like
a
ghost
only
a
few
hours
after
you
saw
me
drowned
in
the
seine
and
through
pride
a
quality
that
is
essentially
english
you
evince
not
the
slightest
surprise
you
greet
me
as
a
matter
of
course
ah
i
repeat
bravo
admirable
there
is
nothing
remarkable
about
it
from
the
manner
in
which
you
fell
from
the
boat
i
knew
very
well
that
you
fell
voluntarily
and
that
the
bullet
had
not
touched
you
and
you
went
away
without
knowing
what
had
become
of
me
what
had
become
of
you
why
i
knew
that
there
were
at
least
five
hundred
people
on
the
two
banks
of
the
river
within
a
space
of
if
you
escaped
death
your
capture
was
certain
and
yet
i
am
here
monsieur
lupin
there
are
two
men
in
the
world
at
whom
i
am
never
astonished
in
the
first
place
myself
and
then
arsène
lupin
the
treaty
of
peace
was
concluded
if
sholmes
had
not
been
successful
in
his
contests
with
arsène
lupin
if
lupin
remained
the
only
enemy
whose
capture
he
must
never
hope
to
accomplish
if
in
the
course
of
their
struggles
he
had
not
always
displayed
a
superiority
the
englishman
had
none
the
less
by
means
of
his
extraordinary
intuition
and
tenacity
succeeded
in
recovering
the
jewish
lamp
as
well
as
the
blue
diamond
this
time
perhaps
the
finish
had
not
been
so
brilliant
especially
from
the
of
the
public
spectators
since
sholmes
was
obliged
to
maintain
a
discreet
silence
in
regard
to
the
circumstances
in
which
the
jewish
lamp
had
been
recovered
and
to
announce
that
he
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
thief
but
as
man
to
man
arsène
lupin
against
herlock
sholmes
detective
against
burglar
there
was
neither
victor
nor
vanquished
each
of
them
had
won
corresponding
victories
therefore
they
could
now
converse
as
courteous
adversaries
who
had
lain
down
their
arms
and
held
each
other
in
high
regard
at
sholmes
request
arsène
lupin
related
the
strange
story
of
his
escape
if
i
may
dignify
it
by
calling
it
an
escape
he
said
it
was
so
simple
my
friends
were
watching
for
me
as
i
had
asked
them
to
meet
me
there
to
recover
the
jewish
lamp
so
after
remaining
a
good
under
the
overturned
boat
i
took
advantage
of
an
occasion
when
folenfant
and
his
men
were
searching
for
my
dead
body
along
the
bank
of
the
river
to
climb
on
top
of
the
boat
then
my
friends
simply
picked
me
up
as
they
passed
by
in
their
and
we
sailed
away
under
the
staring
eyes
of
an
astonished
multitude
including
ganimard
and
folenfant
very
good
exclaimed
sholmes
very
neatly
played
and
now
you
have
some
business
in
england
yes
some
accounts
to
square
up
but
i
forgot
what
about
monsieur
he
knows
everything
all
my
dear
sholmes
what
did
i
tell
you
the
wrong
is
now
irreparable
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
have
allowed
me
to
carry
out
the
affair
in
my
own
way
in
a
day
or
two
more
i
should
have
recovered
the
stolen
goods
from
bresson
restored
them
to
monsieur
and
those
two
honest
citizens
would
have
lived
together
in
peace
and
happiness
ever
after
instead
of
that
instead
of
that
said
sholmes
sneeringly
i
have
mixed
the
cards
and
sown
the
seeds
of
discord
in
the
bosom
of
a
family
that
was
under
your
protection
mon
dieu
of
course
i
was
protecting
them
must
a
person
steal
cheat
and
wrong
all
the
time
then
you
do
good
also
when
i
have
the
time
besides
i
find
it
amusing
now
for
instance
in
our
last
adventure
i
found
it
extremely
diverting
that
i
should
be
the
good
genius
seeking
to
help
and
save
unfortunate
mortals
while
you
were
the
evil
genius
who
dispensed
only
despair
and
tears
tears
tears
protested
sholmes
certainly
the
household
is
demolished
and
alice
demun
weeps
she
could
not
remain
any
longer
ganimard
would
have
discovered
her
some
day
and
through
her
reached
madame
quite
right
monsieur
but
whose
fault
is
it
two
men
passed
by
sholmes
said
to
lupin
in
a
friendly
tone
do
you
know
those
gentlemen
i
thought
i
recognized
one
of
them
as
the
captain
of
the
steamer
and
the
other
i
do
know
it
is
austin
gilett
who
occupies
in
london
a
position
similar
to
that
of
monsieur
dudouis
in
paris
ah
how
fortunate
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
introduce
me
monsieur
dudouis
is
one
of
my
best
friends
and
i
shall
be
delighted
to
say
as
much
of
monsieur
austin
gilett
the
two
gentlemen
passed
again
and
if
i
should
take
you
at
your
word
monsieur
lupin
said
sholmes
rising
and
seizing
lupin
wrist
with
a
hand
of
iron
why
do
you
grasp
me
so
tightly
monsieur
i
am
quite
willing
to
follow
you
in
fact
he
allowed
himself
to
be
dragged
along
without
the
least
resistance
the
two
gentlemen
were
disappearing
from
sight
sholmes
quickened
his
pace
his
even
sank
into
lupin
flesh
come
come
he
exclaimed
with
a
sort
of
feverish
haste
in
harmony
with
his
action
come
quicker
than
that
but
he
stopped
suddenly
alice
demun
was
following
them
what
are
you
doing
mademoiselle
you
need
not
come
you
must
not
come
it
was
lupin
who
replied
you
will
notice
monsieur
that
she
is
not
coming
of
her
own
free
will
i
am
holding
her
wrist
in
the
same
tight
grasp
that
you
have
on
mine
why
because
i
wish
to
present
her
also
her
part
in
the
affair
of
the
jewish
lamp
is
much
more
important
than
mine
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
accomplice
of
bresson
she
has
a
right
to
tell
her
adventure
with
the
baroness
which
will
deeply
interest
monsieur
gilett
as
an
officer
of
the
law
and
by
introducing
her
also
you
will
have
carried
your
gracious
intervention
to
the
very
limit
my
dear
sholmes
the
englishman
released
his
hold
on
his
prisoner
wrist
lupin
liberated
mademoiselle
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
for
a
few
seconds
silently
and
motionless
then
sholmes
returned
to
the
bench
and
sat
down
followed
by
lupin
and
the
girl
after
a
long
silence
lupin
said
you
see
monsieur
whatever
we
may
do
we
will
never
be
on
the
same
side
you
are
on
one
side
of
the
fence
i
am
on
the
other
we
can
exchange
greetings
shake
hands
converse
a
moment
but
the
fence
is
always
there
you
will
remain
herlock
sholmes
detective
and
i
arsène
lupin
and
herlock
sholmes
will
ever
obey
more
or
less
spontaneously
with
more
or
less
propriety
his
instinct
as
a
detective
which
is
to
pursue
the
burglar
and
run
him
down
if
possible
and
arsène
lupin
in
obedience
to
his
burglarious
instinct
will
always
be
occupied
in
avoiding
the
reach
of
the
detective
and
making
sport
of
the
detective
if
he
can
do
it
and
this
time
he
can
do
it
he
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
cunning
cruel
and
odious
then
suddenly
becoming
serious
he
addressed
alice
demun
you
may
be
sure
mademoiselle
even
when
reduced
to
the
last
extremity
i
shall
not
betray
you
arsène
lupin
never
betrays
anyone
especially
those
whom
he
loves
and
admires
and
may
i
be
permitted
to
say
i
love
and
admire
the
brave
dear
woman
you
have
proved
yourself
to
be
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
visiting
card
tore
it
in
two
gave
of
it
to
the
girl
as
he
said
in
a
voice
shaken
with
emotion
if
monsieur
sholmes
plans
for
you
do
not
succeed
mademoiselle
go
to
lady
strongborough
you
can
easily
find
her
address
and
give
her
that
half
of
the
card
and
at
the
same
time
say
to
her
lady
strongborough
will
show
you
the
true
devotion
of
a
sister
thank
you
said
the
girl
i
shall
see
her
and
now
monsieur
sholmes
exclaimed
lupin
with
the
satisfied
air
of
a
gentleman
who
has
fulfilled
his
duty
i
will
say
we
will
not
land
for
an
hour
yet
so
i
will
get
that
much
rest
he
lay
down
on
the
bench
with
his
hands
beneath
his
head
in
a
short
time
the
high
cliffs
of
the
english
coast
loomed
up
in
the
increasing
light
of
a
day
the
passengers
emerged
from
the
cabins
and
crowded
the
deck
eagerly
gazing
on
the
approaching
shore
austin
gilette
passed
by
accompanied
by
two
men
whom
sholmes
recognized
as
sleuths
from

bench
