the
adventures
of
bob
white
i
a
cheerful
worker
a
cheery
whistle
or
a
song
will
help
the
daily
work
little
feathered
people
of
the
green
meadows
the
green
forest
and
the
old
orchard
learned
this
long
ago
and
it
is
one
reason
why
you
will
so
often
find
them
singing
with
all
their
might
when
they
are
hard
at
work
building
their
homes
in
the
spring
most
of
them
sing
but
there
is
one
who
whistles
and
it
is
such
a
clear
and
cheery
whistle
that
it
gladdens
the
hearts
of
all
who
hear
it
many
and
many
a
time
has
farmer
brown
boy
stopped
to
whistle
back
and
never
has
he
failed
to
get
a
response
a
handsome
little
fellow
is
this
whistler
he
is
dressed
in
brown
white
and
black
and
his
name
is
bob
white
sometimes
he
is
called
a
quail
and
sometimes
a
partridge
but
if
you
should
ask
him
he
would
tell
you
promptly
and
clearly
that
he
is
bob
white
and
he
answers
to
no
other
name
all
the
other
little
people
know
and
love
him
well
most
of
them
for
the
cheery
sound
of
his
whistle
but
a
few
like
reddy
fox
and
redtail
the
hawk
for
the
good
meal
he
will
make
them
if
only
they
are
smart
enough
to
catch
him
farmer
brown
boy
loves
him
not
only
for
his
cheerful
whistle
but
because
he
has
found
out
that
bob
white
is
a
worker
as
well
as
a
whistler
one
of
the
best
workers
and
greatest
helpers
on
the
farm
you
see
a
part
of
the
work
of
farmer
brown
boy
is
to
keep
down
the
weeds
and
destroy
the
insects
that
eat
up
the
crops
now
weeds
spring
up
from
seeds
if
there
were
no
there
would
be
no
weeds
in
the
same
way
if
there
were
no
there
would
be
no
insects
but
there
are
millions
and
millions
of
both
and
so
all
summer
long
farmer
boy
has
to
fight
the
weeds
and
the
insects
he
is
very
thankful
for
any
help
he
may
get
and
this
is
one
reason
he
has
become
so
fond
of
old
toad
who
helps
him
keep
the
garden
clear
of
worms
and
bugs
and
of
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
and
others
of
the
little
feathered
people
who
live
in
the
old
orchard
and
hunt
bugs
and
their
eggs
among
the
you
know
the
surest
way
of
winning
friends
is
to
help
others
bob
white
not
only
catches
worms
and
bugs
but
eats
the
seeds
of
weeds
scratching
them
out
where
they
have
hidden
in
the
ground
and
filling
his
little
crop
with
them
until
he
just
has
to
fly
to
the
nearest
fence
and
tell
all
the
world
how
happy
he
is
to
be
alive
and
have
a
part
in
the
work
of
the
great
world
not
one
of
all
the
little
people
is
of
greater
help
to
farmer
brown
boy
than
bob
white
all
the
long
day
he
works
and
with
him
works
bob
and
all
the
little
bobs
scratching
up
here
picking
off
bugs
there
all
the
time
so
happy
and
cheerful
that
everybody
in
the
neighborhood
is
happy
and
cheerful
too
the
best
of
it
is
bob
white
is
always
just
that
way
you
would
think
he
never
had
a
thing
in
the
world
to
worry
about
but
he
does
have
yes
indeed
bob
white
has
plenty
to
worry
about
as
you
shall
hear
but
he
never
allows
his
troubles
to
interfere
with
his
cheerfulness
if
he
can
help
bob
white
bob
white
with
all
his
might
he
whistles
loud
and
clear
no
shame
hurt
his
name
wants
that
all
shall
one
day
peter
rabbit
sat
listening
to
it
and
it
reminded
him
that
he
had
called
on
bob
white
for
some
time
and
also
that
there
were
some
things
about
bob
white
that
he
did
know
he
decided
that
he
would
go
at
once
to
call
on
bob
and
try
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
so
off
he
started
ii
bob
white
has
visitors
bob
white
bob
white
i
bid
the
world
good
white
bob
white
i
whistle
loud
and
clear
very
same
morning
bob
white
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
come
over
to
live
not
very
far
from
the
dear
old
where
peter
rabbit
lives
of
course
peter
did
know
that
bob
had
come
over
there
to
live
for
that
matter
i
doubt
if
bob
white
knew
it
himself
he
just
happened
over
that
way
and
liked
it
and
so
finally
he
made
up
his
mind
to
look
about
there
for
a
place
to
make
his
home
now
peter
rabbit
had
known
bob
white
for
a
long
time
peter
in
his
roaming
about
had
met
bob
a
number
of
times
and
they
had
passed
the
time
of
day
whenever
peter
had
heard
bob
whistling
within
a
reasonable
distance
he
had
made
it
a
point
to
call
on
him
bob
is
such
a
cheery
fellow
that
somehow
peter
always
felt
better
for
just
a
word
or
two
with
him
so
when
bob
began
to
whistle
that
spring
morning
peter
hurried
over
to
call
he
did
have
far
to
go
for
bob
was
sitting
on
a
just
a
little
way
from
the
dear
old
good
morning
said
peter
you
seem
to
be
very
cheerful
this
why
not
replied
bob
white
i
always
cheerful
it
the
only
way
to
get
along
in
this
it
must
be
that
you
do
have
much
to
worry
about
retorted
peter
now
if
you
had
to
run
for
your
life
as
often
as
i
have
to
perhaps
you
would
find
it
so
easy
to
be
always
bob
white
bright
little
eyes
twinkled
the
trouble
with
a
lot
of
people
is
that
they
think
that
no
one
has
worries
but
themselves
said
he
now
there
is
reddy
fox
coming
this
way
what
do
you
suppose
he
is
coming
for
for
me
exclaimed
peter
promptly
preparing
to
scamper
back
to
the
old
nothing
of
the
kind
replied
bob
white
do
think
you
are
so
important
peter
he
does
know
you
are
over
here
at
all
he
has
heard
me
whistling
and
he
coming
to
see
if
he
ca
give
me
a
little
surprise
it
me
and
not
you
he
is
after
what
your
hurry
peter
i
i
think
i
better
be
going
i
call
again
when
you
have
other
visitors
shouted
peter
over
his
shoulder
hardly
had
peter
reached
the
dear
old
when
reddy
fox
reached
the
fence
where
bob
white
was
sitting
good
morning
said
he
trying
to
make
his
voice
sound
as
pleasant
as
he
could
i
glad
to
see
you
over
here
i
heard
you
whistling
and
hurried
over
here
to
welcome
you
i
hope
you
will
like
here
so
well
that
you
will
make
your
home
that
is
very
nice
of
you
replied
bob
white
his
eyes
twinkling
more
than
ever
for
he
knew
why
reddy
hoped
he
would
make
his
home
there
he
knew
that
reddy
hoped
to
find
that
home
and
make
a
good
dinner
on
quail
some
day
it
is
very
pleasant
over
here
and
i
do
know
but
i
will
stay
everybody
seems
very
neighborly
peter
rabbit
has
just
reddy
looked
about
him
in
a
very
sly
way
but
with
a
hungry
look
in
his
eyes
as
he
said
peter
always
is
neighborly
is
he
anywhere
about
now
i
should
like
to
pay
my
respects
to
no
replied
bob
white
peter
left
in
something
of
a
hurry
hello
here
comes
old
man
coyote
people
certainly
are
neighborly
here
why
what
your
hurry
reddy
illustration
i
have
some
important
matters
to
attend
to
over
in
the
green
forest
replied
reddy
with
a
hasty
glance
in
the
direction
of
old
man
coyote
i
hope
i
see
you
often
bob
i
hope
so
replied
bob
white
politely
and
then
added
under
his
breath
but
i
hope
i
see
you
iii
bob
decides
to
build
a
home
man
coyote
call
was
very
much
like
that
of
reddy
fox
he
was
very
very
pleasant
and
told
bob
white
that
he
was
very
glad
indeed
that
bob
had
come
over
on
the
green
meadows
and
he
hoped
that
he
would
stay
no
one
could
have
been
more
polite
than
was
old
man
coyote
bob
white
was
just
as
polite
but
he
was
fooled
no
indeed
he
knew
that
just
like
reddy
fox
the
reason
old
man
coyote
was
so
glad
to
see
him
was
because
he
hoped
to
catch
him
some
fine
day
but
bob
white
did
let
a
little
thing
like
that
bother
him
ever
since
he
could
remember
he
had
been
hunted
that
was
why
he
had
taken
the
precaution
to
sit
on
a
when
he
whistled
up
there
neither
old
man
coyote
nor
reddy
fox
could
reach
him
just
after
old
man
coyote
left
bob
white
saw
some
one
else
headed
his
way
and
this
time
he
did
wait
you
see
it
was
redtail
the
hawk
and
a
was
no
place
to
receive
a
call
from
him
spreading
his
wings
bob
white
flew
across
to
the
dear
old
and
dropped
in
among
the
brambles
close
to
where
peter
rabbit
was
sitting
you
did
expect
me
to
return
your
call
so
soon
did
you
peter
said
he
no
replied
peter
but
i
ever
so
glad
to
see
you
just
the
same
did
you
have
a
pleasant
call
from
reddy
fox
very
replied
bob
white
with
a
chuckle
he
was
ever
so
glad
to
see
me
so
was
old
man
coyote
i
did
wait
to
see
what
old
redtail
would
say
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
he
would
have
liked
better
to
have
seen
me
a
little
nearer
you
see
peter
you
are
not
the
only
one
who
has
to
keep
his
eyes
open
and
his
wits
about
him
all
the
time
there
are
just
as
many
looking
for
me
as
for
you
but
i
do
allow
that
to
make
me
any
the
less
cheerful
every
time
i
whistle
know
that
some
one
is
going
to
come
looking
for
me
but
i
whistle
just
the
same
i
just
have
to
because
in
spite
of
all
its
troubles
life
is
worth
living
and
full
of
happiness
now
i
got
a
secret
to
tell
what
is
it
asked
peter
eagerly
promise
not
to
tell
a
single
soul
commanded
bob
white
ca
i
tell
peter
i
never
keep
secrets
from
her
you
know
replied
peter
well
you
may
tell
her
but
she
must
promise
to
keep
it
secret
said
bob
i
promise
for
her
and
for
myself
declared
peter
what
is
it
i
decided
to
come
over
here
to
live
replied
bob
white
right
here
in
the
old
asked
peter
excitedly
no
but
not
far
from
here
replied
bob
white
i
going
back
to
the
old
pasture
after
bob
and
we
are
going
to
build
a
home
right
goody
cried
peter
clapping
his
hands
where
are
you
going
to
build
that
replied
bob
white
is
for
bob
to
and
when
she
does
you
tell
me
where
it
is
so
that
i
can
come
over
and
call
wo
you
cried
peter
that
depends
replied
bob
white
you
know
there
are
some
things
it
is
better
not
to
no
i
do
know
retorted
peter
i
your
friend
and
i
do
see
what
harm
it
could
do
for
me
to
know
where
your
home
without
meaning
to
friends
sometimes
do
the
most
harm
of
any
one
especially
if
they
talk
too
much
replied
bob
white
now
the
way
is
clear
and
i
must
hurry
back
to
the
old
pasture
to
tell
bob
how
nice
it
is
and
with
this
away
he
flew
now
what
did
he
mean
by
friends
who
talk
too
much
muttered
peter
could
he
have
meant
me
iv
bob
white
and
peter
become
neighbors
strictly
minds
his
own
affairs
and
cheerfully
doth
labor
is
the
one
whom
i
would
choose
always
to
be
my
is
just
the
kind
of
a
neighbor
peter
rabbit
found
bob
white
to
be
bob
and
bob
had
come
down
from
the
old
pasture
and
built
their
home
near
the
dear
old
and
so
become
the
neighbors
of
peter
and
little
peter
bob
was
very
neighborly
he
often
dropped
in
to
have
a
chat
with
peter
and
peter
was
always
glad
to
see
him
for
he
is
such
a
cheerful
fellow
that
peter
always
felt
better
for
having
him
about
it
always
is
that
way
with
cheerful
people
they
are
just
like
sunshine
but
though
bob
and
bob
had
built
their
home
near
peter
he
know
just
where
it
was
no
sir
peter
did
know
just
where
that
home
of
the
bob
whites
was
it
was
because
he
did
try
to
find
out
oh
my
no
peter
could
no
more
have
helped
trying
to
find
out
than
he
could
have
helped
breathing
that
was
the
curiosity
in
him
he
wasted
a
great
deal
of
time
trying
to
find
bob
white
home
all
to
no
purpose
at
first
he
was
rather
put
out
because
bob
white
would
tell
him
where
it
was
hidden
but
bob
just
smiled
and
told
peter
that
the
reason
he
would
was
because
he
thought
a
great
deal
of
peter
and
wanted
him
for
a
friend
always
then
said
peter
i
should
think
you
would
tell
me
where
your
home
is
there
ought
not
to
be
secrets
between
friends
i
do
think
much
of
a
friendship
that
can
not
be
how
would
you
feel
peter
if
harm
came
to
me
and
my
family
through
you
asked
bob
white
dreadfully
declared
peter
but
do
you
suppose
i
would
let
any
harm
come
to
you
a
nice
kind
of
a
friend
you
must
think
me
no
replied
bob
white
soberly
i
do
think
you
would
let
any
harm
come
to
us
if
you
knew
it
but
you
lived
long
enough
peter
to
know
that
there
are
eyes
and
ears
and
noses
watching
listening
smelling
everywhere
all
the
time
now
supposing
that
when
you
were
sure
that
nobody
saw
you
somebody
see
you
visit
my
house
or
supposing
reddy
fox
just
happened
to
run
across
your
tracks
and
followed
them
to
my
house
it
would
be
your
fault
if
something
dreadful
happened
to
us
yet
you
would
be
the
cause
of
it
you
remember
what
i
told
you
the
other
day
that
there
are
some
things
it
is
better
not
to
peter
looked
very
thoughtful
and
pulled
his
whiskers
while
he
turned
this
over
in
his
mind
that
is
a
new
idea
to
me
said
he
at
last
i
never
had
thought
of
it
before
i
certainly
never
would
be
able
to
forgive
myself
if
anything
happened
to
you
because
of
of
course
you
would
replied
bob
white
no
more
would
i
ever
be
able
to
forgive
myself
if
anything
happened
to
my
family
because
i
had
told
some
one
where
my
home
peter
nodded
of
course
if
i
should
just
happen
to
your
home
all
by
myself
you
would
be
angry
would
you
he
asked
bob
white
laughed
of
course
not
said
he
just
the
same
i
would
advise
you
not
to
to
find
it
then
you
will
have
nothing
to
trouble
your
mind
if
you
should
be
followed
and
something
dreadful
did
happen
to
me
or
mine
you
see
there
are
just
as
many
who
would
like
to
make
a
dinner
of
me
as
there
are
who
would
like
to
make
a
dinner
of
you
and
i
would
a
whole
lot
rather
sit
on
a
and
whistle
than
to
fill
somebody
and
i
would
a
lot
rather
have
you
declared
peter
others
are
interested
in
bob
white
rabbit
was
the
only
one
who
was
interested
in
bob
white
and
in
bob
hidden
home
oh
my
no
it
seemed
to
peter
that
reddy
and
granny
fox
were
prowling
around
the
dear
old
most
of
the
time
at
first
he
did
understand
it
it
is
me
they
are
after
because
they
know
well
enough
that
they
ca
catch
me
here
said
he
to
himself
as
he
watched
them
one
morning
it
is
danny
meadow
mouse
because
danny
has
been
over
this
way
for
a
long
time
i
do
see
how
it
can
be
bob
white
because
he
is
likely
to
stay
on
the
ground
while
they
are
around
and
they
ca
catch
him
unless
he
is
on
the
he
was
so
busy
trying
to
puzzle
out
what
should
bring
reddy
and
granny
that
way
so
often
that
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
jimmy
skunk
steal
up
behind
him
illustration
boo
said
jimmy
and
peter
nearly
jumped
out
of
his
skin
what
did
you
do
that
for
demanded
peter
indignantly
just
to
teach
you
that
you
should
go
to
sleep
without
keeping
your
ears
open
replied
jimmy
with
a
grin
i
was
asleep
protested
peter
crossly
i
was
just
watching
reddy
and
granny
fox
and
wondering
what
brings
them
over
here
so
you
might
just
as
well
have
been
asleep
replied
jimmy
supposing
i
had
been
my
cousin
shadow
the
peter
shivered
at
the
very
thought
jimmy
continued
you
are
old
enough
to
know
peter
that
it
is
safe
to
be
so
interested
in
one
thing
that
you
forget
to
watch
out
for
other
things
as
for
reddy
and
granny
fox
you
ought
to
know
what
brings
them
over
this
way
so
what
demanded
peter
has
bob
white
got
a
nest
somewhere
around
here
asked
jimmy
by
way
of
answer
replied
peter
slowly
i
suppose
he
has
but
what
of
that
why
reddy
and
granny
are
looking
for
it
stupid
replied
jimmy
peter
stared
at
jimmy
a
minute
in
a
puzzled
way
what
do
they
want
of
that
he
asked
finally
they
do
eat
eggs
do
they
eggs
hatch
out
into
little
birds
do
they
demanded
jimmy
if
reddy
and
granny
can
find
that
nest
they
wait
until
the
eggs
have
hatched
into
birds
and
then
well
i
heard
say
that
there
is
nothing
more
delicious
than
young
quail
now
do
you
see
peter
did
of
course
he
did
he
understood
perfectly
reddy
and
granny
had
heard
bob
white
whistling
over
there
every
day
and
they
knew
that
meant
that
his
home
was
far
away
it
was
all
very
plain
now
by
the
way
you
do
happen
to
know
where
that
nest
is
do
you
asked
jimmy
carelessly
no
i
do
exclaimed
peter
and
suddenly
was
glad
that
he
know
about
that
nest
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
he
demanded
suspiciously
i
hungry
for
some
eggs
confessed
jimmy
frankly
you
would
rob
and
bob
white
of
their
eggs
would
you
cried
peter
i
thought
better
of
you
than
that
jimmy
jimmy
grinned
do
get
excited
peter
said
he
i
told
that
bob
lays
a
great
many
eggs
and
if
that
the
case
she
would
miss
a
jimmy
skunk
you
horrid
so
there
declared
peter
do
blame
me
retorted
jimmy
old
mother
nature
gave
me
a
taste
for
eggs
just
as
she
gave
reddy
fox
a
taste
for
rabbit
you
have
any
idea
where
that
nest
is
have
you
no
i
have
if
i
had
i
would
tell
you
declared
peter
well
so
long
replied
jimmy
i
think
i
have
a
look
for
it
i
do
wish
bob
white
and
his
wife
the
least
bit
of
harm
but
i
would
like
two
or
three
of
those
and
with
this
jimmy
skunk
ambled
out
to
look
for
bob
white
nest
vi
the
cunning
of
and
bob
white
bob
white
brought
bob
down
to
the
green
meadows
from
the
old
pasture
in
the
beautiful
springtime
she
was
as
delighted
as
he
had
hoped
she
would
be
very
wisely
he
had
not
even
hinted
that
he
thought
there
was
the
place
of
all
places
for
them
to
build
their
home
he
knew
that
she
would
never
be
satisfied
unless
she
felt
that
she
was
the
one
who
had
chosen
the
place
for
their
home
so
bob
did
so
much
as
hint
that
he
had
a
home
in
mind
he
did
even
tell
her
how
beautiful
it
was
over
on
the
green
meadows
near
the
dear
old
he
let
her
find
it
out
for
herself
now
little
bob
was
very
anxious
to
get
to
housekeeping
and
no
sooner
did
she
reach
the
green
meadows
than
she
made
up
her
mind
that
here
was
the
place
of
all
places
for
a
home
in
the
first
place
it
was
very
beautiful
and
bob
has
an
eye
for
beauty
in
the
second
place
there
was
plenty
to
eat
one
of
the
most
important
things
to
consider
when
you
are
likely
to
have
a
great
many
little
mouths
to
feed
in
the
third
place
there
were
plenty
of
good
hiding
places
and
lastly
bob
liked
the
neighbors
bob
white
took
care
not
to
let
her
see
that
he
was
tickled
he
gravely
pointed
out
to
her
the
fact
that
granny
and
reddy
fox
old
man
coyote
and
the
hawk
would
soon
discover
that
they
were
living
there
and
then
there
would
be
danger
all
the
time
and
they
would
never
know
what
it
was
to
be
free
from
worry
not
a
bit
more
than
in
the
old
pasture
where
we
built
last
year
snapped
bob
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
wherever
we
build
we
will
be
in
danger
it
always
has
been
so
and
i
guess
it
always
will
be
so
we
been
smart
enough
to
fool
our
enemies
before
and
i
guess
we
can
do
it
again
i
not
afraid
if
you
bob
hastened
to
say
that
he
was
afraid
he
would
have
her
think
that
for
the
world
oh
my
no
he
was
just
pointing
out
the
dangers
so
that
they
might
make
no
mistake
bob
did
half
hear
what
he
was
saying
she
was
too
busy
poking
about
running
here
running
there
and
all
the
time
using
her
sharp
little
eyes
for
all
they
were
worth
bob
waited
patiently
a
twinkle
in
his
own
eyes
he
knew
that
when
bob
made
up
her
mind
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
presently
she
called
to
him
in
a
low
voice
and
he
flew
over
to
join
her
here
she
announced
is
where
we
will
bob
looked
the
ground
over
with
a
critical
eye
do
you
think
my
dear
that
this
is
rather
close
to
the
crooked
little
path
he
asked
i
have
noticed
that
reddy
fox
and
timmy
skunk
use
this
path
a
great
deal
not
to
mention
farmer
brown
that
what
makes
it
the
safest
place
on
the
green
meadows
stupid
declared
little
bob
they
will
never
think
to
look
for
our
home
so
close
to
where
they
pass
these
weeds
are
very
thick
and
will
hide
our
nest
completely
this
old
fallen
will
give
splendid
protection
on
one
side
the
old
is
so
near
that
in
case
of
need
we
can
get
to
it
in
a
hurry
and
there
be
perfectly
safe
you
mark
my
words
bob
white
no
one
will
think
of
looking
here
for
our
nest
if
you
use
your
common
sense
and
do
all
your
whistling
far
enough
away
reddy
and
the
others
are
going
to
do
all
their
hunting
around
the
place
you
do
your
whistling
so
it
is
for
you
to
make
this
the
very
safest
place
in
the
world
do
you
see
yes
my
dear
replied
bob
meekly
you
are
very
clever
and
cunning
i
never
should
have
thought
of
choosing
such
a
place
but
i
guess
you
are
quite
i
know
i
am
retorted
bob
now
you
fly
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
old
and
whistle
while
i
get
busy
here
i
am
anxious
to
get
to
work
at
bob
looked
at
his
little
brown
wife
with
admiration
then
he
discreetly
ran
under
cover
of
the
weeds
and
grass
until
he
thought
it
was
safe
to
take
wing
after
which
he
flew
to
the
other
side
of
the
dear
old
and
there
began
to
whistle
as
only
he
can
vii
bob
white
finds
that
bob
is
right
a
quarrel
you
may
often
stay
by
letting
others
have
their
you
will
find
too
that
other
people
are
quite
as
likely
to
be
right
as
you
are
now
while
bob
white
told
bob
that
he
guessed
she
was
right
in
choosing
the
place
she
did
for
their
home
he
was
not
at
all
sure
of
it
in
his
own
mind
it
was
a
place
he
would
have
chosen
if
the
matter
had
been
left
to
him
no
sir
that
place
would
have
been
his
choice
he
knew
of
at
least
half
a
dozen
places
which
he
thought
much
better
and
safer
but
after
all
this
was
to
be
bob
home
even
more
than
his
for
she
was
the
one
who
would
have
to
stay
there
all
the
long
days
sitting
on
those
beautiful
white
eggs
they
hoped
to
have
soon
so
bob
kept
his
opinions
to
himself
and
if
he
worried
a
little
because
the
new
home
was
so
close
to
the
crooked
little
path
along
which
reddy
and
granny
fox
went
so
often
he
said
nothing
and
brought
his
share
of
grasses
straw
and
leaves
with
which
to
build
the
nest
bob
was
very
particular
about
that
nest
just
a
common
open
nest
would
do
perhaps
in
that
wise
little
head
of
hers
she
guessed
just
what
was
going
on
in
bob
mind
and
how
he
really
did
approve
at
all
of
building
there
so
she
made
a
very
clever
little
roof
or
dome
of
grasses
and
straw
over
the
nest
with
a
little
entrance
on
one
side
when
it
was
all
done
only
the
very
sharpest
eyes
ever
would
discover
it
of
course
bob
was
proud
of
it
very
proud
indeed
my
dear
it
the
finest
nest
i
ever
seen
he
declared
i
hope
i
do
hope
no
one
will
find
bob
looked
at
him
sharply
why
do
you
own
up
that
you
wish
it
was
somewhere
else
she
demanded
bob
looked
a
little
foolish
i
ca
quite
get
over
the
idea
that
this
is
a
very
dangerous
place
he
confessed
but
i
great
faith
in
your
judgment
my
dear
he
hastened
to
add
then
see
to
it
that
you
are
careful
when
you
come
over
this
way
and
never
under
any
circumstances
fly
directly
here
retorted
bob
keep
away
unless
i
call
for
you
and
when
you
do
come
fly
over
in
the
long
grass
back
there
and
then
keep
out
of
sight
and
walk
over
here
under
cover
of
the
grass
and
bob
promised
he
would
do
just
as
she
had
told
him
to
and
to
prove
it
he
stole
away
through
the
long
grass
and
did
not
take
wing
until
he
was
far
from
the
nest
then
he
flew
over
beyond
the
dear
old
and
whistled
with
all
his
might
from
sheer
happiness
it
was
long
before
there
were
fifteen
beautiful
white
eggs
in
the
nest
in
the
weeds
beside
the
crooked
little
path
and
then
bob
anxiety
increased
you
may
be
sure
time
and
time
again
he
saw
reddy
fox
or
granny
fox
or
jimmy
skunk
trot
down
the
crooked
little
path
and
he
knew
that
they
were
coming
to
look
for
his
nest
but
never
once
did
they
think
of
looking
in
that
patch
of
weeds
for
it
never
entered
their
heads
that
any
one
would
build
so
close
to
a
path
they
used
so
much
but
they
hunted
and
hunted
everywhere
else
and
all
the
time
little
bob
sat
on
those
white
eggs
and
the
color
of
her
cloak
was
so
nearly
the
color
of
the
brown
grasses
and
leaves
that
even
if
they
had
looked
straight
at
her
it
is
at
all
likely
that
they
would
have
seen
her
little
by
little
bob
confessed
to
himself
that
bob
was
right
she
had
chosen
the
very
safest
place
on
the
green
meadows
for
their
home
it
was
safest
because
it
was
the
last
place
any
one
would
look
for
it
then
bob
grew
less
anxious
and
spent
all
his
spare
time
in
fooling
those
who
were
looking
for
his
home
viii
bob
fools
his
neighbors
all
fair
in
love
and
war
is
said
course
this
is
true
a
lot
is
done
that
most
unfair
no
one
ought
to
is
always
so
when
hate
rules
and
the
queer
thing
is
it
is
also
true
sometimes
when
love
rules
love
quite
often
does
unfair
things
and
then
tries
to
excuse
them
but
bob
white
did
feel
that
there
was
anything
unfair
in
trying
to
fool
his
neighbors
not
a
bit
of
it
you
see
he
was
doing
it
for
love
and
war
both
he
was
doing
it
for
love
of
shy
little
bob
and
their
home
and
for
the
kind
of
war
that
is
always
going
on
in
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
of
course
the
little
people
who
live
there
do
call
it
war
but
you
know
how
it
is
the
big
people
all
the
time
trying
to
catch
those
smaller
than
themselves
and
the
little
people
all
the
time
trying
to
get
the
best
of
the
big
people
so
bob
white
felt
that
it
was
perfectly
fair
and
right
that
he
should
fool
those
of
his
neighbors
who
were
hunting
for
his
home
and
so
it
was
he
would
sit
on
a
whistling
as
only
he
can
whistle
and
telling
all
the
world
that
he
bob
white
was
there
presently
he
would
see
reddy
fox
trotting
down
the
crooked
little
path
and
pretending
that
he
was
just
out
for
a
stroll
and
not
at
all
interested
in
bob
or
his
affairs
then
bob
would
pretend
to
look
all
around
as
if
to
see
that
no
danger
was
near
after
that
he
would
fly
over
to
a
certain
place
which
looked
to
be
just
the
kind
of
a
place
for
a
nest
and
there
he
would
hide
in
the
grass
just
as
soon
as
he
disappeared
reddy
fox
would
grin
in
that
sly
way
of
his
and
say
to
himself
so
that
where
your
nest
is
i
think
i
have
a
look
over
then
he
would
steal
over
to
where
he
had
seen
bob
disappear
and
poke
his
sharp
nose
into
every
bunch
of
grass
and
peek
under
every
little
bush
bob
would
wait
until
he
heard
those
soft
footsteps
very
near
him
then
he
would
fly
up
with
a
great
noise
of
his
swift
little
wings
as
if
he
were
terribly
frightened
and
from
a
distant
he
would
call
in
the
most
anxious
sounding
voice
reddy
would
be
sure
then
that
he
was
near
the
nest
and
would
hunt
and
hunt
all
the
time
little
bob
would
be
sitting
comfortably
on
those
precious
eggs
in
the
nest
in
the
close
beside
the
crooked
little
path
chuckling
to
herself
as
she
listened
to
bob
voice
you
see
she
knew
just
what
he
was
doing
it
was
the
same
way
with
jimmy
skunk
and
granny
fox
and
even
peter
rabbit
all
of
them
hunted
and
hunted
for
that
nest
and
watched
bob
white
and
were
sure
that
they
knew
just
where
to
look
for
his
home
and
afterward
wondered
why
it
was
that
they
could
find
it
jimmy
skunk
wanted
some
of
those
eggs
reddy
and
granny
fox
wanted
to
catch
bob
or
be
ready
to
gobble
up
the
babies
when
they
should
hatch
out
of
those
beautiful
white
eggs
as
for
peter
rabbit
he
wanted
to
know
where
that
nest
was
just
out
of
curiosity
he
would
have
harmed
bob
or
one
of
those
eggs
for
the
world
but
bob
knew
that
if
peter
knew
where
that
nest
was
he
might
visit
it
when
some
one
was
watching
him
and
something
dreadful
might
happen
as
a
result
so
he
thought
it
best
to
fool
peter
just
as
he
did
the
others
and
i
think
it
was
do
you
ix
peter
has
hard
work
believing
his
own
eyes
when
with
your
eyes
you
see
a
thing
ca
believe
it
so
pray
tell
me
what
you
can
believe
really
like
to
are
that
way
sometimes
they
are
so
surprising
that
it
seem
that
they
can
be
true
just
ask
peter
rabbit
or
little
peter
either
one
will
tell
you
that
they
have
had
hard
work
to
believe
what
their
eyes
saw
you
see
it
was
this
way
peter
knew
that
somewhere
near
the
dear
old
was
the
home
of
bob
white
anyway
bob
had
said
that
it
was
near
there
and
he
himself
was
never
very
far
away
so
peter
did
doubt
that
bob
had
told
him
the
truth
no
one
would
stay
around
one
place
day
after
day
in
the
beautiful
springtime
when
everybody
was
busy
housekeeping
unless
his
home
was
very
near
but
peter
had
looked
and
looked
for
that
home
of
bob
white
without
ever
getting
so
much
as
a
glimpse
of
it
he
had
watched
bob
white
and
had
visited
every
place
that
he
saw
bob
go
to
but
bob
had
managed
to
keep
his
secret
and
peter
was
no
wiser
than
before
though
he
was
thinner
from
running
about
so
much
little
peter
had
tried
her
best
to
make
him
see
that
it
was
no
business
of
his
you
see
she
knew
just
how
bob
felt
about
wanting
her
home
a
secret
for
little
peter
had
had
many
anxious
hours
when
her
own
babies
were
very
small
finally
peter
did
give
up
but
it
was
because
he
had
looked
in
every
place
he
could
think
of
and
at
last
had
made
up
his
mind
that
if
bob
white
really
had
a
nest
in
the
green
meadows
it
certainly
was
near
the
dear
old
then
one
morning
a
surprising
thing
happened
peter
was
just
getting
ready
to
run
over
to
the
laughing
brook
when
some
one
right
in
front
of
him
there
in
the
old
exclaimed
illustration
be
careful
where
you
step
peter
rabbit
peter
stopped
short
and
looked
to
see
who
had
spoken
there
under
a
tangle
of
brambles
was
little
bob
white
peter
was
surprised
for
he
had
not
seen
her
enter
the
dear
old
oh
said
he
then
he
bowed
politely
how
do
you
do
bob
white
i
glad
you
decided
to
make
us
a
call
i
hope
bob
is
very
well
i
have
seen
him
for
several
days
but
i
heard
his
whistle
and
it
sounds
as
if
he
were
feeling
very
he
is
replied
little
bob
then
she
added
anxiously
do
please
be
very
careful
where
you
step
why
what
the
matter
asked
peter
looking
down
at
his
feet
in
a
puzzled
way
just
then
peter
who
had
heard
them
talking
came
hurrying
up
bob
white
became
more
anxious
than
ever
oh
peter
do
do
be
careful
where
step
she
cried
peter
looked
as
puzzled
as
peter
did
just
then
little
bob
uttered
the
softest
sweetest
little
call
and
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
peter
and
peter
as
if
the
brown
leaves
which
carpeted
the
dear
old
suddenly
came
to
life
and
started
to
run
peter
eyes
almost
popped
out
of
his
head
and
he
rubbed
them
twice
to
make
sure
that
he
really
saw
what
he
thought
he
saw
what
was
it
why
a
whole
family
of
the
funniest
little
birds
scurrying
as
fast
as
their
small
legs
could
take
them
to
the
shelter
of
bob
wings
x
new
tenants
for
the
who
proves
himself
a
neighbor
kind
will
find
content
and
peace
of
two
three
four
oh
dear
they
run
so
fast
i
ca
count
them
are
they
darlings
i
so
glad
you
brought
them
over
for
us
to
see
bob
how
many
are
there
cried
little
peter
as
she
and
peter
watched
the
tiny
little
babies
of
bob
white
scamper
to
the
shelter
of
their
mother
wings
under
the
friendly
brambles
of
the
dear
old
there
are
fifteen
replied
bob
white
proudly
my
gracious
what
a
family
exclaimed
peter
i
do
see
how
you
keep
track
of
all
of
them
i
should
think
you
would
be
worried
to
they
are
a
great
care
confessed
little
bob
white
that
is
why
i
have
brought
them
over
to
the
old
i
hope
you
and
peter
will
not
mind
if
we
live
here
for
a
while
until
they
can
fly
it
is
the
safest
place
i
know
we
be
tickled
to
death
to
have
you
here
declared
peter
we
own
the
dear
old
though
we
lived
here
so
long
we
almost
feel
as
if
it
belongs
to
us
but
of
course
any
one
who
wants
to
is
free
to
live
here
i
do
know
of
any
one
we
would
rather
have
here
than
you
and
your
family
by
the
way
i
do
see
how
you
could
travel
far
with
such
little
babies
may
i
ask
where
you
came
from
little
bob
eyes
twinkled
certainly
she
replied
we
have
traveled
far
we
came
straight
from
our
home
but
where
was
your
home
peter
asked
the
question
eagerly
for
you
remember
he
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
trying
to
find
that
home
of
the
bob
whites
just
over
yonder
in
that
little
patch
of
weeds
across
the
crooked
little
path
you
see
it
was
very
handy
to
the
old
replied
bob
what
peter
fairly
shouted
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
been
living
so
near
as
all
that
bob
nodded
i
surely
have
she
replied
i
been
right
where
i
could
see
you
every
day
as
i
sat
on
my
but
how
did
you
dare
build
in
such
a
dangerous
place
why
reddy
and
granny
fox
passed
within
a
few
feet
of
you
every
day
i
never
heard
of
such
a
crazy
thing
peter
looked
as
if
he
did
believe
it
even
yet
it
was
the
safest
place
on
the
green
meadows
retorted
bob
i
should
think
that
by
this
time
you
would
have
learned
peter
rabbit
that
the
safest
place
to
hide
is
the
place
where
no
one
will
look
the
proof
of
it
is
right
here
in
these
babies
of
mine
are
they
darlings
i
sat
there
day
after
day
and
watched
you
and
reddy
and
granny
fox
and
jimmy
skunk
hunting
for
me
and
had
many
a
good
laugh
all
to
myself
i
knew
that
not
one
of
you
would
dream
that
i
would
be
so
foolishly
wise
as
to
build
my
home
where
it
could
be
so
easily
found
and
therefore
you
would
look
for
it
there
and
i
was
peter
chuckled
you
were
just
right
bob
she
declared
it
is
the
smartest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
my
dear
if
peter
does
feel
foolish
he
ought
to
i
told
him
that
it
was
none
of
his
business
where
your
home
was
but
he
was
so
curious
that
he
would
keep
hunting
for
it
and
to
think
that
all
the
time
it
was
close
by
do
you
feel
foolish
peter
yes
my
dear
i
certainly
do
replied
peter
meekly
but
now
that
i
know
where
it
was
i
am
satisfied
and
i
glad
that
bob
has
brought
her
family
to
live
in
the
dear
old
i
think
it
will
be
great
fun
watching
those
youngsters
grow
and
i
ca
help
thinking
that
this
is
a
great
deal
safer
for
them
than
the
home
they
have
just
that
why
i
brought
them
here
replied
bob
as
long
as
they
were
only
eggs
that
was
the
safest
place
but
now
that
they
have
hatched
out
and
can
run
about
they
would
be
safe
a
minute
over
there
as
it
is
i
expect
it
wo
be
long
before
they
will
be
wanting
to
get
out
in
the
great
world
and
then
my
worries
will
really
begin
bringing
up
a
large
family
is
a
great
it
is
so
declared
peter
xi
watch
tour
step
watch
your
step
be
sure
you
know
what
lies
just
before
because
if
you
should
careless
be
certain
you
would
step
no
was
that
way
with
peter
rabbit
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
did
watch
out
he
would
step
no
more
not
in
the
old
anyway
but
he
was
afraid
dreadfully
afraid
that
one
of
bob
babies
might
step
no
more
it
seemed
to
peter
that
they
were
always
just
under
foot
it
made
him
nervous
every
time
he
moved
little
bob
or
peter
was
sure
to
cry
watch
your
step
peter
or
do
step
on
one
of
those
darlings
so
every
time
he
moved
peter
looked
sharply
to
see
that
there
a
tiny
brown
bird
hiding
under
a
brown
leaf
you
know
he
would
have
stepped
on
one
of
them
for
the
world
really
there
was
half
as
much
danger
as
their
fond
mother
seemed
to
think
for
little
as
they
were
those
bob
white
babies
were
very
spry
and
very
smart
too
but
you
know
how
it
is
with
mothers
they
seem
to
be
always
expecting
something
dreadful
will
happen
to
their
babies
so
twenty
times
a
day
peter
would
hear
that
warning
watch
your
step
still
in
spite
of
this
he
was
glad
that
the
bob
white
family
had
moved
over
to
the
dear
old
it
gave
him
a
chance
to
learn
more
about
the
ways
of
bob
white
and
his
children
than
he
could
possibly
have
learned
in
any
other
way
you
know
peter
is
always
anxious
to
learn
especially
about
other
people
it
seemed
to
him
that
never
had
he
seen
babies
grow
as
did
the
little
bob
whites
they
were
everywhere
there
were
fifteen
of
them
and
peter
often
wondered
how
under
the
sun
their
mother
kept
track
of
all
of
them
but
she
did
one
thing
he
noticed
and
this
was
that
they
obeyed
promptly
whenever
she
called
to
them
if
redtail
the
hawk
came
sailing
lazily
over
the
old
watching
with
sharp
eyes
to
see
if
anything
was
going
on
down
there
that
he
did
know
about
little
bob
would
give
a
warning
and
every
one
of
those
youngsters
would
squat
down
right
where
he
happened
to
be
and
not
move
until
she
told
him
he
might
so
old
never
once
suspected
that
the
bob
white
family
was
there
when
bob
called
them
to
her
they
came
running
on
the
instant
such
obedience
was
beautiful
to
see
then
when
they
were
all
nestled
under
her
wings
she
would
tell
them
about
the
great
world
and
all
the
dangers
that
they
would
have
to
watch
out
for
when
they
were
big
enough
to
go
out
into
it
and
how
each
one
was
to
be
met
as
they
ran
this
way
and
that
way
in
the
old
they
picked
up
tiny
seeds
peter
had
not
supposed
that
there
were
so
many
seeds
as
those
little
bob
whites
found
you
know
peter
does
not
eat
tiny
seeds
and
so
he
never
had
noticed
them
before
bob
led
them
about
showing
them
what
seeds
were
best
and
what
to
leave
alone
they
did
have
to
be
shown
but
once
often
they
varied
their
fare
by
picking
tiny
insects
from
the
leaves
and
once
in
a
while
there
would
be
a
struggle
between
two
or
more
for
possession
of
a
worm
peter
always
liked
to
watch
this
it
was
very
funny
in
a
few
days
there
were
no
bugs
or
worms
to
be
found
in
the
old
at
least
not
on
or
near
the
ground
the
bob
white
family
had
eaten
i
wish
they
would
live
here
all
the
time
declared
peter
i
do
like
bugs
and
worms
they
give
me
a
crawly
feeling
every
time
i
see
but
a
growing
family
must
have
plenty
to
eat
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
bob
led
her
youngsters
forth
to
hunt
bugs
and
worms
and
seeds
on
the
green
meadows
but
never
very
far
from
the
old
so
that
in
case
of
need
they
could
run
back
to
its
friendly
shelter
and
every
night
she
brought
them
back
there
to
sleep
under
the
friendly
brambles
so
after
all
it
was
only
for
a
little
while
that
peter
had
to
watch
his
steps
and
he
was
really
sorry
when
he
no
longer
heard
that
warning
every
time
he
moved
you
see
he
had
grown
very
fond
of
the
little
bob
whites
xii
the
little
bob
whites
at
school
goes
to
school
the
universal
rule
nature
long
ago
it
always
should
be
course
there
are
all
kinds
of
schools
but
to
one
kind
or
another
everybody
has
to
go
a
lot
of
people
do
know
they
are
going
to
school
but
they
are
just
the
same
if
you
should
ask
them
what
school
they
go
to
they
would
tell
you
they
do
go
to
any
but
they
do
just
the
same
they
go
to
the
hardest
school
of
all
the
school
of
experience
that
is
the
school
in
which
we
all
learn
how
to
live
and
take
care
of
ourselves
it
is
just
the
same
with
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
the
four
babies
of
johnny
and
polly
chuck
went
to
school
in
the
old
orchard
just
as
soon
as
they
were
big
enough
to
run
around
it
was
the
same
way
with
the
children
of
peter
rabbit
in
the
dear
old
and
the
youngsters
of
danny
and
nanny
meadow
mouse
on
the
green
meadows
and
une
billy
possum
lively
family
in
the
green
forest
and
little
joe
otter
two
hopefuls
in
the
laughing
brook
so
of
course
all
the
little
bob
whites
started
in
to
go
to
school
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
their
shells
the
very
first
thing
they
learned
was
to
mind
their
parents
which
is
the
very
first
lesson
all
little
folks
must
learn
you
see
my
dears
explained
bob
as
they
nestled
under
her
wings
the
great
world
is
full
of
dangers
especially
for
little
bob
whites
and
so
if
you
want
to
live
to
grow
up
to
be
as
handsome
and
smart
as
your
father
you
must
mind
instantly
when
we
speak
to
so
as
every
one
of
the
fifteen
little
bob
whites
wanted
to
five
to
grow
up
to
be
as
handsome
and
smart
as
their
father
each
one
took
the
greatest
care
to
mind
the
very
second
bob
or
bob
spoke
while
they
were
in
the
dear
old
they
were
quite
safe
but
just
the
same
every
little
while
bob
would
give
the
danger
signal
which
meant
to
squat
and
keep
perfectly
still
or
another
call
that
meant
to
come
running
to
her
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
it
was
until
she
was
sure
that
they
had
learned
to
mind
instantly
that
she
led
them
out
on
to
the
green
meadows
among
the
grasses
and
the
weeds
then
there
was
always
real
danger
as
she
took
great
pains
to
tell
them
there
was
danger
from
the
air
where
old
redtail
the
hawk
sailed
round
and
round
watching
below
for
heedless
and
careless
little
folks
there
was
danger
from
reddy
and
granny
fox
and
old
man
coyote
prowling
about
with
sharp
eyes
and
keen
ears
and
wonderful
noses
all
the
time
hunting
for
heedless
little
people
and
there
was
danger
from
blacksnake
and
some
of
his
cousins
slipping
silently
through
the
grass
so
the
little
bob
whites
learned
to
be
always
on
the
watch
as
they
ran
this
way
and
that
way
hunting
for
bugs
and
worms
and
seeds
at
the
least
little
unknown
sound
they
squatted
and
waited
for
signal
that
all
was
well
she
taught
them
to
know
ol
mistah
buzzard
who
would
hurt
a
feather
of
them
from
old
redtail
the
hawk
by
the
way
he
sailed
and
sailed
without
flapping
his
wings
just
as
soon
as
they
could
fly
a
little
she
taught
them
to
make
sure
just
where
the
nearest
bushes
or
trees
were
so
that
they
could
fly
to
them
in
case
of
sudden
danger
on
the
ground
she
taught
them
how
to
find
the
safest
places
in
which
to
spend
the
night
oh
there
was
a
great
deal
for
those
little
bob
whites
to
learn
yes
indeed
and
it
did
do
to
forget
a
single
thing
forgetting
just
once
might
mean
a
dreadful
thing
so
they
did
forget
bob
white
himself
taught
them
many
things
for
bob
is
wise
in
the
ways
of
the
great
world
and
he
is
the
best
of
fathers
so
the
little
bob
whites
grew
and
grew
until
they
were
too
big
to
nestle
under
the
wings
of
bob
and
could
fly
on
swift
strong
wings
and
all
the
time
they
were
at
school
without
knowing
it

we
got
the
finest
looking
garden
any
where
around
i
do
remember
ever
having
a
garden
with
so
little
harm
done
by
bugs
and
worms
all
our
neighbors
are
complaining
that
bugs
and
worms
are
the
worst
ever
this
year
and
that
their
gardens
are
being
eaten
up
in
spite
of
all
that
they
can
do
i
proud
of
the
way
in
which
you
taken
care
of
farmer
brown
boy
flushed
with
pleasure
he
had
worked
hard
in
that
garden
ever
since
the
seeds
were
planted
he
had
fought
the
weeds
and
the
bugs
and
worms
but
so
had
some
of
his
neighbors
yet
in
spite
of
this
their
gardens
were
nearly
ruined
they
had
worked
just
as
hard
as
he
had
but
the
worms
and
the
bugs
had
been
too
much
for
them
he
could
understand
why
he
had
succeeded
when
they
had
failed
there
must
be
a
reason
there
is
a
reason
for
everything
after
breakfast
he
put
on
his
old
straw
hat
and
started
down
to
the
garden
to
look
it
over
still
puzzling
over
the
reason
why
his
garden
was
so
much
better
than
others
just
on
the
edge
of
the
garden
was
an
old
board
he
lifted
one
end
of
it
and
peeped
under
old
toad
looked
up
at
him
and
blinked
sleepily
but
in
the
most
friendly
way
waistcoat
was
filled
out
until
it
looked
too
tight
for
comfort
fanner
brown
boy
smiled
as
he
put
the
board
down
gently
he
knew
what
made
that
waistcoat
so
tight
it
was
filled
with
bugs
and
worms
there
a
part
of
the
reason
muttered
farmer
brown
boy
a
little
farther
on
he
discovered
little
friend
the
song
sparrow
very
busy
among
the
there
another
part
of
the
reason
chuckled
farmer
brown
boy
at
the
end
of
a
long
row
he
sat
down
to
think
it
over
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
owed
a
great
deal
to
old
toad
and
little
friend
and
a
lot
of
the
feathered
folk
of
the
old
orchard
for
his
garden
but
he
had
had
their
help
in
other
years
when
his
garden
had
not
looked
half
as
well
and
yet
when
there
had
not
been
nearly
as
many
bugs
and
worms
as
this
year
their
help
and
his
own
hard
work
accounted
for
part
of
the
reason
for
his
garden
but
he
could
help
but
feel
that
there
must
be
something
else
he
did
know
about
he
was
thinking
so
hard
that
he
sat
perfectly
still
presently
a
pair
of
bright
eyes
peeped
out
at
him
from
under
a
then
right
out
in
front
of
him
stepped
a
smart
trim
little
fellow
dressed
in
brown
gray
and
white
with
black
trimmings
it
was
bob
white
he
called
softly
and
out
ran
bob
and
fifteen
children
at
a
word
from
bob
they
scattered
and
went
to
work
among
the
plants
farmer
brown
boy
held
his
breath
as
he
watched
they
did
pay
the
least
attention
to
him
because
you
know
he
sat
perfectly
still
some
scratched
the
ground
just
like
the
hens
at
home
and
then
picked
up
things
so
small
that
he
could
see
what
they
were
but
he
knew
he
knew
that
they
were
tiny
seeds
and
because
all
the
seeds
which
he
and
farmer
brown
had
planted
were
now
great
strong
plants
he
knew
that
these
were
seeds
of
weeds
bob
himself
was
very
busy
among
the
he
was
near
enough
for
farmer
brown
boy
to
see
what
he
was
doing
he
was
eating
those
striped
beetles
which
farmer
brown
boy
had
fought
so
long
and
which
he
had
come
to
hate
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
eleven
counted
farmer
brown
boy
and
then
bob
moved
on
to
where
he
could
be
seen
among
the
he
could
see
bob
and
she
was
picking
off
bugs
as
fast
as
bob
was
taking
the
what
the
others
were
doing
he
did
know
but
he
could
guess
there
the
rest
of
the
reason
he
suddenly
exclaimed
in
triumph
he
spoke
aloud
and
in
a
twinkling
there
was
a
bob
white
to
be
seen
xiv
a
little
lesson
in
arithmetic
do
say
you
arithmetic
and
find
it
dull
and
dry
you
find
it
most
astonishing
if
you
sincerely
brown
boy
used
to
feel
that
way
but
he
does
any
more
he
never
could
see
any
use
in
puzzling
over
sums
in
school
he
said
that
there
was
anything
interesting
in
it
nothing
but
hard
work
he
used
to
complain
about
it
at
home
farmer
brown
would
listen
awhile
then
he
would
say
if
you
live
long
enough
my
son
you
will
find
that
figures
talk
and
that
they
tell
the
most
wonderful
there
was
always
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
when
he
said
this
now
of
course
fanner
brown
boy
knew
that
his
father
did
mean
that
figures
could
speak
right
out
of
course
not
but
he
never
could
understand
just
what
he
did
mean
and
he
was
interested
enough
to
try
to
find
out
so
he
would
continue
to
scowl
over
his
arithmetic
and
wish
the
teacher
would
give
such
hard
lessons
and
when
the
long
summer
vacation
began
he
just
forgot
all
about
figures
and
sums
until
after
he
discovered
bob
white
and
his
family
helping
to
rid
the
garden
of
bugs
and
worms
and
seeds
of
weeds
after
he
discovered
them
he
went
down
to
the
garden
every
day
to
watch
them
they
soon
found
out
that
he
would
hurt
them
and
after
that
they
just
paid
no
attention
to
him
at
all
but
went
right
on
with
their
business
all
about
him
and
that
business
was
the
filling
of
their
stomachs
with
seeds
and
worms
and
bugs
one
day
bob
white
ate
twelve
caterpillars
while
farmer
brown
boy
was
watching
him
he
got
out
a
stubby
pencil
and
a
scrap
of
paper
if
every
one
of
those
bob
whites
eats
twelve
of
those
horrid
worms
at
one
meal
that
would
be
let
me
he
wrinkled
his
brows
there
are
bob
and
bob
and
fifteen
young
bobs
and
that
makes
seventeen
now
if
each
eats
twelve
that
will
make
twelve
times
he
put
down
the
figures
on
his
bit
of
paper
and
worked
over
them
for
a
few
minutes
that
makes
caterpillars
for
one
meal
he
muttered
and
in
one
month
of
thirty
days
they
would
eat
if
they
only
ate
one
meal
a
day
but
they
eat
ever
so
many
meals
a
day
and
that
means
he
stopped
to
stare
at
the
figures
on
the
bit
of
paper
with
eyes
round
with
wonder
then
he
whistled
a
little
low
whistle
of
sheer
astonishment
no
wonder
i
got
a
good
garden
when
those
fellows
are
at
work
in
it
he
exclaimed
illustration
then
he
sat
down
to
watch
bob
catching
which
he
knew
were
laying
the
eggs
which
would
hatch
out
into
the
worms
that
spoiled
the
cabbages
he
counted
the
number
she
caught
while
she
was
in
sight
he
did
the
same
thing
with
another
of
the
bob
whites
who
was
catching
and
with
another
who
was
hunting
grasshoppers
then
he
did
some
more
figuring
on
that
bit
of
paper
when
he
had
finished
he
got
up
and
went
straight
down
to
the
cornfield
where
farmer
brown
was
at
work
i
know
now
what
you
meant
when
you
used
to
tell
me
that
figures
talk
said
he
why
they
told
me
more
than
i
ever
dreamed
they
told
me
that
the
bob
whites
are
the
best
friends
we
got
and
that
the
reason
that
we
got
the
best
garden
anywhere
around
is
just
because
they
have
made
it
so
why
those
little
brown
birds
are
actually
making
money
for
us
and
we
never
guessed
it
xv
farmer
brown
boy
grows
indignant
be
indignant
is
to
be
angry
in
a
good
cause
if
you
lose
your
temper
and
give
way
to
anger
because
things
do
not
suit
you
you
are
not
indignant
you
are
simply
angry
but
if
anger
wells
up
in
your
heart
because
of
harm
or
injustice
which
is
done
to
some
one
else
or
even
to
yourself
then
you
become
indignant
farmer
brown
boy
had
spent
all
his
spare
time
down
in
the
garden
watching
bob
white
and
his
family
in
fact
he
had
been
there
so
much
that
all
the
bob
whites
had
come
to
look
on
him
as
harmless
if
not
actually
a
friend
they
just
did
pay
him
any
attention
at
all
but
went
about
their
business
as
if
he
were
nowhere
about
and
their
business
was
ridding
that
garden
of
bugs
and
worms
and
seeds
of
weeds
in
order
to
fill
their
stomachs
what
tickled
farmer
brown
boy
was
that
the
bugs
and
worms
of
which
they
seemed
the
most
fond
were
the
very
ones
which
did
the
most
harm
to
the
growing
plants
over
beyond
the
garden
was
a
field
of
wheat
you
know
from
wheat
comes
the
flour
of
which
your
bread
is
made
now
there
is
a
certain
little
bug
called
the
which
is
such
a
hungry
rascal
that
when
he
and
a
lot
of
his
kind
get
into
a
field
of
wheat
they
often
spoil
the
whole
crop
they
suck
the
juices
from
the
plants
so
that
they
wilt
and
die
farmer
brown
boy
had
heard
his
neighbors
complaining
that
were
very
bad
that
year
and
he
knew
that
they
must
be
by
the
looks
of
the
wheat
on
the
farms
of
his
neighbors
but
farmer
brown
wheat
looked
as
fine
as
wheat
could
look
it
was
very
plain
that
there
were
no
there
and
he
often
had
wondered
why
when
they
were
so
bad
in
the
fields
of
his
neighbors
farmer
brown
boy
noticed
that
bob
white
and
his
family
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
the
one
day
he
noticed
bob
picking
something
from
a
stem
of
wheat
he
went
over
to
see
what
it
might
be
of
course
bob
scurried
away
but
when
farmer
brown
boy
looked
at
that
he
found
some
on
it
then
he
knew
what
bob
had
been
doing
he
had
been
picking
off
and
eating
those
dreadful
little
bugs
and
he
knew
too
why
it
was
that
their
was
the
best
for
miles
around
it
was
because
bob
white
and
his
family
hunted
for
and
ate
those
bugs
as
fast
as
they
appeared
hurrah
for
you
you
the
greatest
little
helpers
a
farmer
ever
had
cried
farmer
brown
boy
and
hurried
off
to
tell
farmer
brown
what
he
had
found
out
so
the
summer
passed
and
the
cool
crisp
days
of
autumn
came
the
wheat
had
been
harvested
and
the
vegetables
gathered
and
stored
away
jack
frost
had
begun
to
paint
the
maple
trees
red
and
yellow
the
garden
was
bare
and
the
stubble
in
the
a
golden
brown
the
little
feathered
people
who
do
not
like
cold
weather
had
flown
away
to
the
sunny
southland
led
by
ol
mistah
buzzard
striped
chipmunk
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
and
happy
jack
the
gray
squirrel
were
busy
from
morning
till
night
storing
away
seeds
and
nuts
on
which
to
live
through
the
long
cold
winter
these
were
glorious
days
and
bob
white
loved
every
one
of
them
son
said
farmer
brown
one
morning
those
bob
whites
must
be
fat
with
the
good
living
they
have
had
seeing
that
we
have
fed
them
off
the
farm
all
summer
do
you
think
that
it
is
their
turn
to
feed
us
i
think
broiled
bob
white
on
toast
would
taste
pretty
good
the
shooting
season
begins
next
week
so
i
suppose
you
will
get
out
your
gun
and
shoot
a
few
of
those
bob
whites
for
there
was
a
twinkle
a
kindly
twinkle
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
but
farmer
brown
boy
did
see
that
twinkle
his
face
grew
red
a
hot
anger
filled
his
heart
he
was
indignant
he
was
very
indignant
to
think
that
his
father
should
ever
hint
at
such
a
thing
but
he
did
forget
to
be
respectful
no
sir
said
he
i
would
shoot
one
of
them
for
anything
in
the
world
they
do
owe
us
anything
we
owe
them
if
it
had
been
for
them
we
would
have
had
half
a
crop
of
wheat
and
our
garden
would
have
been
just
as
poor
as
those
of
our
neighbors
i
not
going
to
shoot
and
i
not
going
to
let
any
one
else
shoot
if
i
can
help
it
so
there
xvi
farmer
brown
boy
talks
things
over
there
nothing
to
compare
with
in
earth
or
sea
or
up
love
prevailed
everywhere
there
would
be
no
terrible
wars
no
prisons
no
dreadful
poverty
no
bitter
quarrels
between
those
who
work
and
those
for
whom
they
work
and
on
the
green
meadows
and
in
the
green
forest
there
would
be
no
fear
of
man
and
no
frightful
suffering
from
traps
and
terrible
guns
love
that
wonderful
great
thing
which
is
contained
in
one
little
word
of
four
letters
could
and
would
bring
joy
and
happiness
to
every
heart
for
all
time
if
only
we
would
give
it
a
chance
it
was
love
in
the
heart
of
farmer
brown
boy
which
made
him
indignant
when
farmer
brown
hinted
that
he
might
take
his
gun
and
shoot
bob
white
and
his
family
you
see
he
had
made
friends
with
the
bob
whites
and
learned
to
love
them
and
no
one
can
bear
the
thought
of
hurting
those
they
love
he
had
replied
to
his
father
respectfully
but
his
face
had
flushed
red
and
in
his
voice
there
had
been
the
ring
of
indignation
which
is
a
certain
kind
of
anger
farmer
brown
actually
chuckled
when
he
heard
it
then
he
turned
and
held
out
his
big
hand
shake
hands
son
said
he
i
was
just
trying
you
out
to
see
what
you
would
say
you
know
you
used
to
be
very
fond
of
hunting
and
i
was
just
wondering
if
your
love
of
killing
or
trying
to
kill
was
stronger
than
your
sense
of
right
and
justice
now
i
know
that
it
is
and
i
ever
so
glad
so
you
think
the
bob
whites
have
earned
our
protection
fanner
brown
boy
face
flushed
again
but
this
time
it
was
with
pleasure
oh
dad
i
so
glad
you
do
want
them
killed
to
eat
he
cried
i
ought
to
have
known
that
you
were
just
teasing
me
i
did
like
to
hunt
with
my
gun
once
but
that
was
when
i
did
know
as
much
as
i
do
now
it
was
exciting
to
try
to
find
the
birds
and
then
see
if
i
could
hit
them
i
just
thought
of
them
as
wild
things
good
to
eat
and
so
smart
that
i
had
to
be
a
little
bit
smarter
to
get
them
i
never
thought
of
them
as
having
any
feelings
but
now
i
know
that
they
love
and
fear
and
suffer
pain
and
work
and
play
and
are
glad
and
sad
just
like
people
i
know
because
i
watched
them
so
i
do
want
to
hurt
them
or
allow
them
to
be
hurt
any
more
than
i
would
real
people
why
i
i
would
have
anything
happen
to
them
for
the
world
dreadfully
afraid
something
will
happen
to
some
of
them
when
the
hunting
season
begins
ca
we
do
anything
for
them
we
can
put
up
some
signs
warning
all
hunters
to
keep
off
of
our
farm
and
forbidding
all
shooting
replied
farmer
brown
then
if
bob
white
and
his
family
are
smart
enough
to
stay
on
our
land
i
guess
they
will
be
safe
but
if
they
go
on
the
land
of
other
people
they
are
likely
to
be
shot
unless
he
paused
unless
i
can
get
other
people
who
own
land
near
us
to
put
up
signs
and
keep
the
hunters
off
and
promise
not
to
shoot
the
bob
whites
themselves
exclaimed
farmer
brown
boy
eagerly
farmer
brown
smiled
exactly
my
son
said
he
it
is
your
chance
to
get
even
to
do
something
for
the
little
friends
who
have
done
so
much
for
you
tomorrow
is
saturday
and
there
will
be
no
school
you
may
have
all
day
in
which
to
see
what
you
can
do
with
the
neighbors
to
save
bob
white
and
his
family
from
the
hunters
listen
bob
would
be
a
blessing
if
for
nothing
but
his
message
of
good
cheer
but
to
the
cheer
he
puts
into
the
world
is
the
daily
help
he
gives
the
man
who
kills
bob
white
kills
one
of
our
best
friends
and
helpers
and
his
shot
hurts
us
more
than
it
does
poor
little
bob
now
let
go
over
to
the
barn
and
see
about
making
those
xviii
a
beautiful
day
made
dreadful
pity
is
aye
is
a
shame
that
rests
on
all
mankind
human
beings
in
cruelty
can
sport
and
pleasure
never
was
a
more
beautiful
day
than
that
crisp
october
one
it
was
one
of
those
days
when
you
just
feel
all
over
how
good
it
is
to
be
alive
bob
white
felt
it
he
tingled
all
over
with
the
joy
of
living
just
as
soon
as
he
opened
his
eyes
very
early
that
morning
he
whistled
for
very
joy
he
loved
all
the
great
world
and
he
felt
that
all
the
great
world
loved
him
he
wanted
to
tell
the
great
world
so
the
merry
little
breezes
of
old
mother
west
wind
tumbling
out
of
the
big
bag
in
which
she
had
brought
them
down
from
the
purple
hills
to
play
all
day
long
on
the
green
meadows
danced
over
to
tell
him
that
they
loved
him
this
made
bob
still
happier
a
certain
man
tramping
along
the
road
toward
the
home
of
farmer
jones
was
feeling
glad
but
his
gladness
was
of
a
different
kind
i
guess
we
are
going
to
have
some
sport
old
fellow
said
he
to
the
dog
trotting
at
his
heels
and
shifted
a
terrible
gun
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
now
if
bob
white
had
understood
the
warning
given
him
by
farmer
boy
he
never
never
would
have
done
as
he
did
but
he
did
understand
that
warning
and
so
when
he
took
it
into
his
pretty
little
head
that
he
wanted
to
try
his
wings
he
led
his
family
straight
over
to
the
land
of
farmer
jones
he
often
had
been
there
before
and
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
go
there
as
often
as
he
pleased
no
harm
had
come
from
these
previous
visits
so
straight
over
to
the
stubble
of
farmer
he
led
the
way
and
soon
he
and
his
family
were
very
busy
picking
up
scattered
grains
of
wheat
and
were
happy
as
you
or
i
would
be
over
a
good
breakfast
right
in
the
midst
of
it
bob
quick
ears
heard
footsteps
he
stretched
his
neck
to
peep
over
the
stubble
and
suddenly
all
the
gladness
and
brightness
of
the
day
was
blotted
out
what
he
saw
was
a
dog
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
and
he
was
following
the
scent
that
one
of
children
made
as
he
ran
about
picking
up
wheat
suddenly
the
dog
stopped
and
stood
perfectly
still
with
one
foreleg
and
nose
pointing
straight
at
a
certain
spot
bob
knew
that
right
at
that
spot
one
of
his
children
was
squatting
close
to
the
ground
as
still
as
a
statue
stood
the
dog
from
behind
him
came
a
man
walking
slowly
and
carefully
and
with
a
terrible
gun
held
in
readiness
when
he
reached
the
dog
he
sent
him
on
there
was
nothing
for
the
bob
white
squatting
there
to
do
but
fly
up
into
the
air
he
shot
on
swift
wings
bang
went
the
terrible
gun
and
down
dropped
that
little
brown
bird
at
the
sound
of
the
terrible
gun
up
jumped
all
the
rest
of
bob
children
in
terrible
fright
for
never
before
had
they
heard
such
a
dreadful
noise
bang
went
the
gun
again
but
this
time
only
a
few
brown
feathers
floated
to
the
ground
bob
and
bob
waited
until
after
the
second
bang
before
they
too
took
to
the
air
for
they
had
had
experience
and
knew
that
after
the
second
bang
they
were
likely
to
be
safe
for
a
while
the
bob
whites
had
scattered
in
all
directions
as
they
had
been
taught
to
do
when
in
danger
bob
flew
straight
over
to
farmer
and
there
presently
he
began
to
call
one
after
another
of
his
family
answered
all
but
the
one
who
had
fallen
at
the
first
shot
got
one
anyway
said
the
hunter
as
he
loaded
his
terrible
gun
and
actually
looked
happy
as
he
went
over
to
help
his
dog
hunt
for
the
bob
white
who
had
fallen
at
the
first
terrible
bang
xviii
the
disappointed
hunter
never
does
to
count
upon
a
thing
until
you
sure
often
less
than
you
expect
but
very
seldom
hunter
who
has
shot
one
of
white
children
chuckled
of
course
he
did
need
it
the
least
bit
in
the
world
having
plenty
of
other
things
to
eat
the
hunter
who
had
shot
one
of
the
birds
gleefully
went
forward
to
pick
up
the
poor
little
brown
bird
he
was
having
what
he
called
sport
it
never
entered
his
head
to
think
of
how
the
bob
whites
must
feel
he
probably
did
think
that
they
had
any
feelings
he
was
pleased
that
he
had
made
a
successful
shot
and
he
was
pleased
to
think
that
he
was
to
have
that
little
brown
bird
to
eat
though
when
he
reached
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
little
bob
white
fall
there
was
no
little
brown
bird
there
no
sir
there
was
not
a
sign
of
that
little
bird
save
a
few
feathers
you
see
he
had
killed
the
little
bob
white
as
he
had
supposed
but
had
broken
a
wing
so
that
it
could
not
fly
but
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
its
legs
and
no
sooner
had
it
hit
the
ground
than
it
had
run
as
fast
as
ever
it
could
through
the
stubble
so
the
little
bob
white
was
where
the
hunter
was
looking
for
it
at
all
of
course
his
dog
helped
him
hunt
and
with
that
wonderful
nose
of
his
he
soon
found
the
scent
of
that
little
bob
white
and
eagerly
followed
it
it
just
happened
that
in
that
field
near
where
the
little
bob
white
fell
was
an
old
home
of
johnny
chuck
and
all
around
the
entrance
to
it
the
sand
had
been
spread
out
now
sand
does
not
hold
scent
the
little
bob
white
knew
nothing
about
that
for
he
had
not
lived
long
enough
to
learn
all
that
a
bob
white
has
to
learn
but
he
did
see
the
open
doorway
across
the
yellow
sand
he
ran
and
into
the
doorway
and
just
a
little
way
down
the
hall
where
he
hid
under
some
dry
brown
leaves
which
had
blown
in
there
he
was
almost
the
color
of
them
himself
as
he
squatted
close
to
the
ground
and
drew
his
feathers
as
close
to
his
body
as
possible
in
doing
this
he
was
doing
a
very
wise
thing
though
he
did
know
it
at
the
time
you
see
his
feathers
drawn
tightly
against
his
body
that
way
prevented
the
scent
which
might
have
told
the
keen
nose
of
that
dog
where
he
was
as
it
was
the
dog
lost
the
scent
at
the
edge
of
the
sand
and
neither
he
nor
the
hunter
once
thought
to
look
in
that
old
hole
so
while
they
hunted
and
hunted
the
little
bob
white
squatted
perfectly
still
though
his
broken
wing
hurt
him
dreadfully
and
the
ache
of
it
made
his
eyes
fill
with
tears
at
last
the
hunter
gave
up
the
search
he
was
too
impatient
to
kill
more
must
be
i
just
wounded
him
said
he
without
one
thought
of
how
dreadful
it
must
be
to
be
wounded
probably
a
fox
will
get
him
bet
i
kill
the
next
one
with
that
he
sent
his
dog
on
to
try
to
find
the
little
bob
brothers
and
sisters
his
terrible
gun
held
ready
to
shoot
the
instant
he
should
see
one
of
them
he
was
having
great
sport
was
that
hunter
while
in
the
hall
of
johnny
chuck
old
house
lay
a
little
brown
bob
white
faint
with
suffering
and
dreadful
fright
it
would
have
been
bad
enough
to
simply
have
such
a
fright
but
to
have
a
broken
wing
and
because
of
this
to
feel
quite
helpless
well
can
you
imagine
anything
worse
xix
frightened
wounded
and
alone
oh
cruel
is
the
thoughtless
deed
that
wounds
another
without
under
the
brown
dead
leaves
which
had
blown
into
the
doorway
of
the
old
house
made
long
ago
in
the
of
farmer
jones
by
johnny
chuck
was
that
poor
little
bob
white
tears
filled
his
eyes
tears
of
fright
and
pain
illustration
he
tried
to
wink
them
back
and
to
think
what
he
should
do
next
but
he
was
too
bewildered
to
think
to
be
bewildered
is
to
be
so
upset
that
you
can
not
understand
what
has
happened
or
is
happening
it
was
just
so
with
this
little
bob
white
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
he
had
been
happily
picking
up
his
breakfast
that
beautiful
october
morning
without
the
least
warning
a
great
dog
had
threatened
to
catch
him
and
he
had
taken
to
his
swift
strong
little
wings
as
he
did
so
he
had
seen
a
great
creature
pointing
a
stick
at
him
but
he
had
not
feared
all
summer
long
he
had
seen
creatures
like
this
one
and
they
had
not
harmed
him
indeed
he
had
come
to
look
on
them
as
his
friends
for
had
not
farmer
brown
boy
watched
him
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
day
after
day
and
not
once
offered
even
to
frighten
them
so
he
had
no
fear
of
this
one
then
from
the
end
of
that
stick
pointed
at
him
had
leaped
fire
and
smoke
and
there
had
been
a
terrible
noise
something
had
struck
him
something
that
stung
and
burned
and
tore
his
tender
flesh
and
one
of
his
swift
strong
little
wings
had
become
useless
so
that
he
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
then
he
had
run
swiftly
until
he
found
this
hiding
place
and
with
his
little
heart
going
with
terror
had
squatted
close
under
the
friendly
brown
leaves
while
the
great
dog
and
the
creature
had
looked
for
him
now
they
had
given
him
up
and
gone
away
at
least
he
could
not
hear
them
what
did
it
all
mean
why
had
this
dreadful
thing
happened
to
him
what
had
he
done
that
the
creature
should
try
to
kill
him
with
the
terrible
outside
the
day
was
as
beautiful
as
ever
but
all
the
joy
of
it
was
gone
instead
it
was
filled
with
terror
what
should
he
do
now
what
he
do
where
were
his
father
and
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
were
such
dreadful
things
happening
to
them
as
had
happened
to
him
would
he
ever
see
them
again
presently
he
heard
a
whistle
a
sad
anxious
whistle
it
was
the
whistle
of
his
father
bob
white
he
was
calling
his
family
together
then
he
heard
answering
whistles
and
he
knew
that
the
others
were
safe
and
would
soon
join
bob
white
but
he
did
not
dare
answer
himself
he
crawled
to
the
doorway
and
peeped
out
he
could
see
the
great
dog
and
the
cruel
creature
with
the
terrible
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
field
he
tried
to
leap
into
the
air
and
fly
as
he
had
been
used
to
doing
but
only
flopped
helplessly
one
wing
was
useless
and
dragged
on
the
ground
it
hurt
so
that
the
pain
made
him
faint
he
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
still
for
a
few
minutes
panting
then
a
new
thought
filled
him
with
another
terrible
fear
if
reddy
fox
or
old
man
coyote
or
redtail
the
hawk
should
happen
along
how
could
he
escape
without
the
use
of
his
wings
if
only
he
were
not
alone
if
only
he
could
reach
his
father
and
mother
perhaps
they
could
help
him
he
struggled
to
his
feet
and
began
to
walk
towards
that
distant
whistle
it
was
slow
work
he
was
weak
and
faint
and
the
drooping
wing
dragged
through
the
stiff
stubble
and
hurt
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
stand
it
often
he
squatted
down
and
panted
with
weariness
and
pain
and
fright
then
he
would
go
on
again
he
was
terribly
thirsty
but
there
was
no
water
to
drink
so
at
last
he
crawled
under
a
fence
and
then
suddenly
right
in
front
of
him
was
one
of
those
creatures
right
then
and
there
the
little
bob
white
gave
up
all
hope
xx
farmer
brown
boy
speaks
his
mind
you
can
not
always
surely
tell
if
things
be
ill
or
things
be
the
poor
suffering
wounded
little
bob
white
crawled
under
the
fence
he
did
know
it
but
he
had
crawled
on
to
the
land
of
farmer
brown
where
a
sign
warned
all
hunters
to
keep
off
that
no
shooting
would
be
allowed
there
and
when
he
looked
up
and
saw
right
in
front
of
him
one
of
those
creatures
like
the
one
with
the
terrible
and
at
once
had
given
up
all
hope
he
had
been
too
sick
at
heart
and
suffering
too
much
to
recognize
farmer
brown
boy
but
that
is
just
who
it
was
you
see
farmer
brown
boy
had
been
so
anxious
for
fear
that
some
hunter
would
come
over
on
his
father
land
in
spite
of
the
signs
that
he
had
gone
down
on
the
green
meadows
just
as
soon
as
he
had
eaten
his
breakfast
he
had
seen
the
hunter
on
the
land
of
farmer
jones
and
had
heard
him
shoot
with
all
his
heart
farmer
brown
boy
had
hoped
that
the
hunter
had
missed
now
as
he
looked
down
and
saw
the
poor
little
suffering
bird
he
knew
that
the
hunter
had
not
missed
and
fierce
anger
swelled
his
heart
he
quite
forgot
that
he
himself
used
to
hunt
with
a
terrible
gun
before
he
had
learned
to
know
and
to
love
the
little
people
of
the
green
meadows
the
green
forest
and
the
old
pasture
he
stooped
and
very
tenderly
lifted
the
little
bob
white
who
closed
his
eyes
and
was
sure
that
now
all
would
soon
be
over
you
poor
little
thing
you
poor
poor
little
thing
said
farmer
brown
boy
as
he
looked
at
the
torn
and
broken
wing
then
he
looked
across
at
the
hunter
and
scowled
savagely
just
then
the
hunter
saw
him
and
at
once
started
towards
him
you
see
the
hunter
thought
that
perhaps
if
he
offered
farmer
brown
boy
money
he
would
allow
him
to
hunt
on
farmer
brown
land
he
knew
that
was
where
bob
white
and
all
his
family
had
flown
to
when
he
reached
the
fence
he
saw
the
little
bob
white
in
the
hands
of
farmer
brown
boy
hello
exclaimed
the
hunter
in
surprise
i
guess
that
my
bird
i
guess
it
nothing
of
the
sort
retorted
farmer
brown
boy
oh
yes
it
is
replied
the
hunter
i
shot
it
a
little
while
ago
but
it
got
away
from
me
i
thank
you
to
hand
it
over
to
me
young
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
retorted
farmer
brown
boy
it
may
be
the
bird
you
shot
more
shame
to
you
but
it
is
yours
it
mine
i
found
it
on
our
land
and
it
belongs
to
me
if
it
belongs
to
any
now
the
hunter
was
tempted
to
reply
sharply
but
remembering
that
he
wanted
to
get
this
boy
permission
to
hunt
on
farmer
brown
land
he
bit
the
angry
reply
off
short
and
said
instead
why
do
you
wring
its
neck
if
you
get
your
father
to
let
me
shoot
on
your
land
i
kill
another
for
you
and
then
you
will
have
a
fine
farmer
brown
boy
grew
red
in
the
face
do
you
dare
put
your
foot
on
this
side
of
the
fence
he
cried
i
have
you
to
know
that
these
bob
whites
are
my
very
best
friends
they
worked
for
me
all
summer
long
and
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
let
any
harm
come
to
them
now
if
i
can
help
it
not
much
look
how
this
poor
little
thing
is
suffering
and
you
call
it
sport
bah
the
law
lets
you
hunt
them
but
it
a
bad
law
it
a
horrid
law
if
they
did
any
harm
it
would
be
different
but
instead
of
doing
harm
they
work
for
us
all
summer
long
and
then
when
the
crops
which
they
have
helped
us
save
are
harvested
we
turn
around
and
allow
them
to
be
shot
but
they
ca
be
shot
on
this
land
and
the
sooner
you
get
away
the
better
i
like
instead
of
getting
angry
the
hunter
laughed
all
right
i
keep
off
your
land
sonny
said
he
but
you
need
get
so
excited
they
only
birds
and
were
made
to
be
no
more
than
you
were
retorted
farmer
brown
boy
and
they
got
feelings
just
as
you
have
this
poor
little
thing
is
trembling
like
a
leaf
in
my
hand
i
not
going
to
wring
its
neck
i
going
to
try
to
cure
with
this
fanner
brown
boy
turned
his
back
on
the
hunter
and
started
for
home
and
the
poor
little
bob
white
not
understanding
had
no
more
hope
than
before
xxi
what
happened
to
the
little
bob
white
his
eyes
tightly
closed
because
of
the
terror
in
his
heart
the
little
bob
white
was
being
carried
by
fanner
brown
boy
very
tender
was
the
way
in
which
he
was
handled
and
after
a
while
he
began
to
take
a
little
comfort
in
the
warmth
of
the
hand
which
held
him
once
in
a
while
farmer
brown
boy
would
gently
smooth
the
feathers
of
the
little
head
and
say
poor
little
straight
home
went
farmer
brown
boy
very
very
gently
he
bathed
the
wounds
of
the
little
bob
white
then
as
gently
as
he
could
he
put
the
broken
bones
of
the
wing
back
in
place
and
bound
them
there
with
little
strips
of
thin
wood
to
keep
them
from
slipping
it
hurt
dreadfully
and
the
little
bob
white
did
know
what
it
all
meant
but
he
had
suffered
so
much
already
that
a
little
more
suffering
did
matter
much
and
he
did
so
much
as
peep
when
it
was
all
over
he
was
put
into
a
box
with
a
bed
of
soft
clean
hay
a
little
dish
of
water
which
he
could
reach
by
just
stretching
out
his
head
and
a
handful
of
wheat
and
then
he
was
left
alone
he
was
too
sick
and
weary
to
want
to
do
anything
but
squat
down
in
that
bed
of
hay
and
rest
he
was
still
afraid
of
what
might
happen
to
him
but
it
was
not
such
a
great
fear
as
before
for
there
had
been
something
comforting
in
the
gentle
touch
of
farmer
brown
boy
he
did
understand
at
all
what
those
strange
wrappings
about
his
body
meant
but
a
lot
of
the
ache
and
pain
had
gone
from
the
broken
wing
so
he
drank
gratefully
of
the
water
for
he
had
been
burning
with
thirst
and
then
settled
himself
as
comfortably
as
possible
and
in
no
time
at
all
was
asleep
yes
sir
he
was
asleep
you
see
he
was
so
worn
out
with
fright
and
pain
that
he
could
keep
his
eyes
open
ever
so
many
times
during
the
day
farmer
brown
boy
came
to
see
how
he
was
getting
along
and
was
so
very
gentle
and
whistled
to
him
so
softly
that
his
little
heart
no
longer
went
with
fear
the
next
morning
the
little
bob
white
felt
so
much
better
that
he
was
up
bright
and
early
and
made
a
good
breakfast
of
the
wheat
left
for
him
but
it
seemed
very
queer
not
to
be
able
to
move
his
wings
he
lift
them
even
the
teeniest
weeniest
bit
because
you
see
farmer
brown
boy
had
bound
them
to
his
sides
with
strips
of
cloth
so
that
he
could
even
try
to
fly
this
was
so
that
that
broken
wing
might
get
well
and
strong
again
now
of
course
the
little
bob
white
had
lived
out
of
doors
all
his
life
and
farmer
brown
boy
knew
that
he
never
could
be
quite
happy
in
the
house
so
he
made
a
wire
pen
in
the
henyard
and
in
one
end
he
made
the
nicest
little
shelter
of
under
which
the
little
bob
white
could
hide
he
put
a
little
dish
of
clean
water
in
the
pen
and
scattered
wheat
on
the
ground
and
then
he
put
the
little
bob
white
in
there
as
soon
as
he
was
left
quite
alone
the
little
bob
white
ran
all
about
to
see
what
his
new
home
was
like
you
see
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
his
legs
i
ca
get
out
thought
he
when
he
had
been
all
around
the
pen
but
neither
can
any
one
get
in
so
i
am
safe
and
that
is
something
to
be
thankful
for
this
creature
is
not
at
all
like
the
one
with
the
terrible
and
i
am
beginning
to
like
him
i
have
got
to
fear
reddy
fox
or
old
man
coyote
or
redtail
the
hawk
i
guess
that
really
i
am
a
lot
better
off
than
if
i
were
out
on
the
green
meadows
unable
to
fly
perhaps
when
my
wing
gets
well
i
will
be
allowed
to
go
i
wonder
where
my
father
and
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
are
and
if
any
of
them
were
hurt
by
that
terrible
xxii
a
joyous
day
for
the
bob
whites
thrice
blessed
be
the
girl
or
boy
who
fills
another
heart
with
day
just
by
chance
bob
white
flew
up
in
a
tree
where
he
could
look
down
in
fanner
brown
henyard
and
there
he
discovered
the
lost
little
bob
and
talked
with
him
then
bob
white
flew
back
to
the
green
meadows
where
little
bob
was
anxiously
waiting
for
him
and
his
heart
was
light
bob
was
watching
for
him
and
flew
to
meet
him
it
all
right
cried
bob
i
found
him
over
in
fanner
of
course
him
meant
the
young
bob
white
who
had
been
given
up
as
killed
what
exclaimed
bob
what
is
a
henyard
and
what
is
he
doing
there
a
henyard
is
a
place
where
farmer
brown
keeps
a
lot
of
big
foolish
birds
explained
bob
and
little
bob
is
a
prisoner
how
dreadful
cried
bob
if
he
a
prisoner
how
can
you
say
it
all
right
because
it
is
replied
bob
he
perfectly
safe
there
and
he
would
be
if
he
were
here
with
us
you
see
he
ca
fly
one
of
his
wings
was
broken
by
the
shot
from
that
terrible
gun
farmer
brown
boy
found
him
and
has
been
very
kind
to
him
he
fixed
that
wing
so
that
i
believe
it
is
going
to
get
quite
as
well
as
ever
you
know
quite
as
well
as
i
do
how
much
chance
little
bob
would
have
had
over
here
with
a
broken
wing
reddy
fox
or
redtail
the
hawk
or
some
one
else
would
have
been
sure
to
get
him
sooner
or
later
but
up
there
they
ca
because
he
is
in
a
wire
pen
he
ca
get
out
but
neither
can
they
get
in
and
so
he
is
safe
he
and
farmer
brown
boy
are
great
friends
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
him
feed
from
the
hand
of
farmer
brown
boy
do
you
know
i
believe
that
boy
is
really
and
truly
our
friend
and
can
be
that
is
what
peter
rabbit
is
always
saying
but
after
all
suffered
from
them
i
ca
quite
make
up
my
mind
that
any
of
those
great
creatures
are
to
be
trusted
said
little
bob
i
got
to
see
for
you
shall
declared
bob
tomorrow
morning
you
shall
go
up
there
and
i
stay
here
to
look
after
the
rest
of
the
youngsters
i
am
afraid
if
we
left
them
alone
some
of
them
would
be
careless
or
foolish
enough
to
go
where
the
hunters
with
terrible
guns
would
find
so
the
next
morning
bob
went
up
to
visit
young
bob
and
she
saw
all
that
bob
had
seen
the
day
before
she
returned
with
a
great
load
off
her
mind
she
knew
that
bob
was
right
and
that
fanner
brown
boy
had
proved
himself
a
true
friend
from
whom
there
was
nothing
to
fear
the
next
day
bob
and
bob
took
the
whole
family
up
there
for
fanner
brown
boy
had
scattered
food
for
them
just
outside
the
henyard
where
the
biddies
could
not
get
it
and
bob
was
smart
enough
to
know
that
no
hunter
would
dare
look
for
them
so
close
to
farmer
brown
house
morning
after
morning
they
went
up
there
to
get
their
breakfast
and
they
did
even
fly
when
farmer
brown
boy
and
farmer
brown
himself
came
out
to
watch
them
eat
then
one
morning
a
wonderful
thing
happened
farmer
brown
boy
took
young
bob
out
of
his
pen
in
the
young
bob
looked
quite
himself
by
this
time
for
the
strips
of
cloth
which
had
bound
his
broken
wing
in
place
had
been
taken
off
and
his
wing
was
as
good
as
ever
fanner
brown
boy
took
him
outside
the
henyard
and
gently
put
him
down
on
the
ground
there
you
are
now
go
and
join
your
family
and
in
the
future
keep
out
of
the
way
of
hunters
said
he
and
laughed
to
see
young
bob
scamper
over
to
join
his
brothers
and
sisters
such
a
fuss
as
they
made
over
him
suddenly
bob
white
flew
up
to
the
top
of
a
post
threw
back
his
head
and
whistled
with
all
his
might
bob
white
bob
white
bob
white
you
see
he
just
had
to
tell
all
the
great
world
of
the
joy
in
his
heart
although
this
was
not
the
time
of
year
in
which
he
usually
whistles
and
this
is
how
it
happened
that
bob
white
and
his
whole
family
came
regularly
to
farmer
brown
for
their
breakfasts
and
no
hunter
ever
had
another
chance
to
carry
fright
and
suffering
and
sorrow
into
their
midst
so
this
is
all
about
bob
white
and
his
family
because
ol
mistah
buzzard
has
come
all
the
way
up
from
ol
virginny
for
me
to
tell
you
about
him
and
his
adventures
i
promised
to
do
it
in
the
very
next
book
the
end
