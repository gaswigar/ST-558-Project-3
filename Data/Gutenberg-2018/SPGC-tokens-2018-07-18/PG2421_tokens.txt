if
poverty
be
a
title
to
poetry
i
am
sure
can
dispute
mine
i
own
myself
of
the
company
of
beggars
and
i
make
one
at
their
weekly
festivals
at
giles
i
have
a
small
yearly
salary
for
my
catches
and
am
welcome
to
a
dinner
there
whenever
i
please
which
is
more
than
most
poets
can
say
player
as
we
live
by
the
muses
it
is
but
gratitude
in
us
to
encourage
poetical
merit
wherever
we
find
it
the
muses
contrary
to
all
other
ladies
pay
no
distinction
to
dress
and
never
partially
mistake
the
pertness
of
embroidery
for
wit
nor
the
modesty
of
want
for
dulness
be
the
author
who
he
will
we
push
his
play
as
far
as
it
will
go
so
though
you
are
in
want
i
wish
you
success

this
piece
i
own
was
originally
writ
for
the
celebrating
the
marriage
of
james
chaunter
and
moll
lay
two
most
excellent
singers
i
have
introduced
the
similes
that
are
in
all
your
celebrated
operas
the
swallow
the
moth
the
bee
the
ship
the
flower
besides
i
have
a
which
the
ladies
always
reckon
charmingly
pathetic
as
to
the
parts
i
have
observed
such
a
nice
impartiality
to
our
two
ladies
that
it
is
impossible
for
either
of
them
to
take
offence
i
hope
i
may
be
forgiven
that
i
have
not
made
my
opera
throughout
unnatural
like
those
in
vogue
for
i
have
no
recitative
excepting
this
as
i
have
consented
to
have
neither
prologue
nor
epilogue
it
must
be
allowed
an
opera
in
all
its
forms
the
piece
indeed
hath
been
heretofore
frequently
represented
by
ourselves
in
our
great
room
at
giles
so
that
i
can
not
too
often
acknowledge
your
charity
in
bringing
it
now
on
the
stage

it

love
to
let

peachum
truly
filch
thy
observation
is
right
we

are
more
beholden

tricks

these
are
only
the
fruits

bitter
bad
judges
in

that
they
think

handsome

cold

ugly
lilies

will
quickly
appear
and
her
face
look
smugly
beneath
the

ear
so
fit
but
a
cord
a

so
charming
a
zone
is
the
youth
in
his
cart
hath
the
air
of
a
lord
and
we
cry
there
dies
an

but
really
husband
you
should
not
be
too
for
you
never
had
a
finer
braver
set
of
men
than
at
present
we
have
not
had
a
murder
among
them
all
these
seven
months
and
truly
my
dear
that
is
a
great
blessing
peachum
what
a
dickens
is
the
woman
always
a
whimpring
about
murder
for
no
gentleman
is
ever
look
upon
the
worse
for
killing
a
man
in
his
own
defence
and
if
business
can
not
be
carried
on
without
it
what
would
you
have
a
gentleman
do
peachum
if
i
am
in
the
wrong
my
dear
you
must
excuse
me
for
no
body
can
help
the
frailty
of
an
conscience
peachum
murder
is
as
fashionable
a
crime
as
a
man
can
be
guilty
of
how
many
fine
gentlemen
have
we
in
newgate
every
year
purely
upon
that
article
if
they
have
wherewithal
to
persuade
the
jury
to
bring
it
in
manslaughter
what
are
they
the
worse
for
it
so
my
dear
have
done
upon
this
subject
was
captain
macheath
here
this
morning
for
the
he
left
with
you
last
week
peachum
yes
my
dear
and
though
the
bank
hath
stopt
payment
he
was
so
chearful
and
so
agreeable
sure
there
is
not
a
finer
gentleman
upon
the
road
than
the
captain
if
he
comes
from
bagshot
at
any
reasonable
hour
he
hath
promis
to
make
one
this
evening
with
polly
and
me
and
bob
booty
at
a
party
of
quadrille
pray
my
dear
is
the
captain
rich
peachum
the
captain
keeps
too
good
company
ever
to
grow
rich
marybone
and
the
are
his
undoing
the
man
that
proposes
to
get
money
by
play
should
have
the
education
of
a
fine
gentleman
and
be
train
up
to
it
from
his
youth
peachum
really
i
am
sorry
upon
polly
account
the
captain
hath
not
more
discretion
what
business
hath
he
to
keep
company
with
lords
and
gentlemen
he
should
leave
them
to
prey
upon
one
another
peachum
upon
polly
account
what
a
plague
does
the
woman
mean
upon
polly
account
peachum
captain
macheath
is
very
fond
of
the
girl
peachum
and
what
then
peachum
if
i
have
any
skill
in
the
ways
of
women
i
am
sure
polly
thinks
him
a
very
pretty
man
peachum
and
what
then
you
would
not
be
so
mad
to
have
the
wench
marry
him
gamesters
and
highwaymen
are
generally
very
good
to
their
whores
but
they
are
very
devils
to
their
wives
peachum
but
if
polly
should
be
in
love
how
should
we
help
her
or
how
can
she
help
herself
poor
girl
i
am
in
the
utmost
concern
about
her
air
iv
why
is
your
faithful
slave
disdain
if
love
the
virgin
heart
invade
how
like
a
moth
the
simple
maid
still
plays
about
the
flame
if
soon
she
be
not
made
a
wife
her
honour
sing
and
then
for
life
she
what
i
dare
not
name
peachum
look
ye
wife
a
handsome
wench
in
our
way
of
business
is
as
profitable
as
at
the
bar
of
a
temple
who
looks
upon
it
as
her
livelihood
to
grant
every
liberty
but
one
you
see
i
would
indulge
the
girl
as
far
as
prudently
we
can
in
any
thing
but
marriage
after
that
my
dear
how
shall
we
be
safe
are
we
not
then
in
her
husband
power
for
a
husband
hath
the
absolute
power
over
all
a
wife
secrets
but
her
own
if
the
girl
had
the
discretion
of
a
who
can
have
a
dozen
young
fellows
at
her
ear
without
complying
with
one
i
should
not
matter
it
but
polly
is
tinder
and
a
spark
will
at
once
set
her
on
a
flame
married
if
the
wench
does
not
know
her
own
profit
sure
she
knows
her
own
pleasure
better
than
to
make
herself
a
property
my
daughter
to
me
should
be
like
a
to
a
minister
of
state
a
key
to
the
whole
gang
married
if
the
affair
is
not
already
done
i
terrify
her
from
it
by
the
example
of
our
neighbours
peachum
my
dear
you
may
injure
the
girl
she
loves
to
imitate
the
fine
ladies
and
she
may
only
allow
the
captain
liberties
in
the
view
of
interest
peachum
but
is
your
duty
my
dear
to
warn
the
girl
against
her
ruin
and
to
instruct
her
how
to
make
the
most
of
her
beauty
i
go
to
her
this
moment
and
sift
her
in
the
meantime
wife
rip
out
the
coronets
and
marks
of
these
dozen
of
cambric
handkerchiefs
for
i
can
dispose
of
them
this
afternoon
to
a
chap
in
the
city
exit
peachum
peachum
never
was
a
man
more
out
of
the
way
in
an
argument
than
my
husband
why
must
our
polly
forsooth
differ
from
her
sex
and
love
only
her
husband
and
why
must
polly
marriage
contrary
to
all
observations
make
her
the
less
followed
by
other
men
all
men
are
thieves
in
love
and
like
a
woman
the
better
for
being
another
property
air
of
all
the
simple
things
we
do
a
maid
is
like
the
golden
ore
which
hath
guineas
intrinsical
i
whose
worth
is
never
known
before
it
is
try
and
imprest
in
the
mint
a
wife
like
a
guinea
in
gold
stampt
with
the
name
of
her
spouse
now
here
now
there
is
bought
or
is
sold
and
is
current
in
every
house
enter

peachum
come
hither
filch
i
am
as
fond
of
this
child
as
though
my
mind
misgave
me
he
were
my
own
he
hath
as
fine
a
hand
at
picking
a
pocket
as
a
woman
and
is
as
as
a
juggler
if
an
unlucky
session
does
not
cut
the
rope
of
thy
life
i
pronounce
boy
thou
wilt
be
a
great
man
in
history
where
was
your
post
last
night
my
boy
filch
i
ply
at
the
opera
madam
and
considering
was
neither
dark
nor
rainy
so
that
there
was
no
great
hurry
in
getting
chairs
and
coaches
made
a
tolerable
hand
o
these
seven
handkerchiefs
madam
peachum
colour
ones
i
see
they
are
of
sure
sale
from
our
warehouse
at
redriff
among
the
seamen
filch
and
this
peachum
set
in
gold
a
pretty
encouragement
this
to
a
young
beginner
filch
i
had
a
fair
tug
at
a
charming
gold
watch
pox
take
the
tailors
for
making
the
fobs
so
deep
and
narrow
it
stuck
by
the
way
and
i
was
forc
to
make
my
escape
under
a
coach
really
madam
i
fear
i
shall
be
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
my
youth
so
that
every
now
and
then
since
i
was
pumpt
i
have
thoughts
of
taking
up
and
going
to
sea
peachum
you
should
go
to
hockley
in
the
hole
and
to
marybone
child
to
learn
valour
these
are
the
schools
that
have
bred
so
many
brave
men
i
thought
boy
by
this
time
thou
hadst
lost
fear
as
well
as
shame
poor
lad
how
little
does
he
know
as
yet
of
the
old
baily
for
the
first
fact
i
insure
thee
from
being
hang
and
going
to
sea
filch
will
come
time
enough
upon
a
sentence
of
transportation
but
now
since
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
go
to
your
book
and
learn
your
catechism
for
really
a
man
makes
but
an
ill
figure
in
the
ordinary
paper
who
can
not
give
a
satisfactory
answer
to
his
questions
but
hark
you
my
lad
do
tell
me
a
lye
for
you
know
i
hate
a
liar
do
you
know
of
anything
that
hath
pass
between
captain
macheath
and
our
polly
filch
i
beg
you
madam
do
ask
me
for
i
must
either
tell
a
lye
to
you
or
to
miss
polly
for
i
promis
her
i
would
not
tell
peachum
but
when
the
honour
of
our
family
is
concern
filch
i
shall
lead
a
sad
life
with
miss
polly
if
ever
she
comes
to
know
that
i
told
you
besides
i
would
not
willingly
forfeit
my
own

to
swell
her

and
she

a

peachum
let

looks
upon
himself
in

capacity
as
a

by
his
profession
besides
what
he
hath
already
i
know
he
is
in

both
these
ways

i

i
am
in

then
if

would
like
that
we
should
get
the
reward

the

prodigiously
conceited
no

we

you

peachum
we

account
lockit
if

it
you
find
is
fair
and
clearly
stated
peachum
this
long
arrear
of
the
government
is
very
hard
upon

can
it
be
expected
that
we
would
hang
our

for
nothing
when
our
betters
will
hardly
save
theirs
without
being
paid
for
it
unless
the
people
in

pay
better
i
promise
them
for
the
future
i
shall
let
other
rogues
live
besides
their

lockit
perhaps
brother
they
are
afraid
these
matters
may
be
carried
too
far
we
are
treated
too
by
them
with
contempt
as
if
our
profession
were
not
reputable
peachum
in
one
respect
indeed
our
employment
may
be
reckon
dishonest
because
like
great

we
encourage
those
who
betray
their

lockit
such
language
brother
any
where

here
poor

that
for

receiv
you
had
promis
him
a

two
longer
without

lockit
peachum
this
is
the
first

my

peachum
business
is
at
an
end
if
once
we
act
dishonourably
lockit
who
accuses
me
peachum
you
are
warm
brother
lockit
he
that
attacks
my
honour
attacks
my
and
this
usage

is
not
to
be
borne
peachum
since
you
provoke
me
to

i
must
tell
you
too
that
coaxer

you
with
defrauding

collaring

peachum
brother
brother
we
are
both

both
losers
in
the

for
you
know
we
have
it
in
our
power
to
hang
each
other
you
should
not
be
so
passionate
lockit
nor
you
so
provoking
peachum
is
our
mutual
interest
is
for
the
interest
of
the

we
should
agree
if
i
said
any

i
ask
pardon
lockit
brother
peachum
i
can

peachum
i
only

lucy
but
love

a
misfortune
that

they

always
very
curious
in
my
liquors
lockit
there
is
no
perfum
breath
like
it
i
have
been
long
acquainted
with
the
flavour
of
those
lips
ha
i
dye
trapes
fill
it
up
i
take
as
large
draughts
of
liquor
as
i
did
of
i
hate
a
flincher
in
either
air
xlv
a
shepherd
kept
sheep
in
the
days
of
my
youth
i
could
bill
like
a
dove
fa
la
la
like
a
sparrow
at
all
times
was
ready
for
love
fa
la
la
the
life
of
all
mortals
in
kissing
should
pass
lip
to
lip
while
we
young
then
the
lip
to
the
glass
fa
la
but
now
peachum
to
our
if
you
have
blacks
of
any
kind
brought
in
of
late
mantoes
velvet
scarfs
petticoats
let
it
be
what
it
will
i
am
your
chap
for
all
my
ladies
are
very
fond
of
mourning
peachum
why
look
ye
dye
you
deal
so
hard
with
us
that
we
can
afford
to
give
the
gentlemen
who
venture
their
lives
for
the
goods
little
or
nothing
trapes
the
hard
times
oblige
me
to
go
very
near
in
my
to
be
sure
of
late
years
i
have
been
a
great
sufferer
by
the
three
thousand
pounds
would
hardly
make
me
the
act
for
destroying
the
mint
was
a
severe
cut
upon
our
business
then
if
a
customer
stept
out
of
the
way
we
knew
where
to
have
her
no
doubt
you
know
coaxer
there
a
wench
now
day
with
a
good
suit
of
clothes
of
mine
upon
her
back
and
i
could
never
set
eyes
upon
her
for
three
months
since
the
act
too
against
imprisonment
for
small
sums
my
loss
there
too
hath
been
very
considerable
and
it
must
be
so
when
a
lady
can
borrow
a
handsom
petticoat
or
a
clean
gown
and
i
not
have
the
least
hank
upon
her
and
o
my
conscience
most
ladies
take
a
delight
in
cheating
when
they
can
do
it
with
safety
peachum
madam
you
had
a
handsom
gold
watch
of
us
day
for
seven
considering
we
must
have
our
to
a
gentleman
upon
the
road
a
gold
watch
will
be
scarce
worth
the
taking
trapes
consider
peachum
that
watch
was
remarkable
and
not
of
very
safe
if
you
have
any
black
velvet
scarfs
they
are
a
handsom
and
take
with
most
gentlemen
who
deal
with
my
is
i
that
put
the
ladies
upon
a
good
foot
is
not
youth
or
beauty
that
fixes
their
price
the
gentlemen
always
pay
according
to
their
dress
from
half
a
crown
to
two
guineas
and
yet
those
hussies
make
nothing
of
bilking
of
then
too
allowing
for
i
have
eleven
fine
customers
now
down
under
the
surgeon
hands
what
with
fees
and
other
expenses
there
are
great
and
no
comings
in
and
not
a
farthing
to
pay
for
at
least
a
month
we
run
great
risques
great
risques
indeed
peachum
as
i
remember
you
said
something
just
now
of
coaxer
trapes
yes
to
be
sure
i
stript
her
of
a
suit
of
my
own
clothes
about
two
hours
ago
and
have
left
her
as
she
should
be
in
her
shift
with
a
lover
of
hers
at
my
house
she
call
him
up
stairs
as
he
was
going
to
in
a
hackney
and
i
hope
for
her
own
sake
and
mine
she
will
persuade
the
captain
to
redeem
her
for
the
captain
is
very
generous
to
the
ladies
lockit
what
captain

he
thought
i
did
not
know
him
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
yours
peachum
only
captain

as
fine
as
a
lord
peachum

shall
set
your

any
of

half
a
dozen

you
give
me
leave
to
make
you
a
present
of
this

of
for

it
is
captain
macheath
trapes
though
he
thinks
i

forgot
him
no
body
knows
him
better
i
have
taken
a
great
deal
of

so
whatever
happens
i
wash
my
hands
o
it
hath
always
been
my
maxim
that
one
friend
should
assist
another
but
if
you
please
i
take
one
of
the
scarfs
home
with
me
is
always
good
to
have
something

one
evening

born
with
her

broke
and
her

forlorn

thus
i
lie
rolling

sporting
on

so
many

say
i
were
to

i
never
could
be

that
would
give

greater

than
the

will
pardon
my
passion
when
i
was
so
happy
to
see
you
i
was
so
with
the
spleen
that
i
was
perfectly
out
of
myself
and
really
when
one
hath
the
spleen
every
thing
is
to
be
excus
by
a
friend
air
xlvii
now
roger
i
tell
thee
because
thou
my
son
when
a
wife
in
her
pout
as
she
sometimes
no

the
good
husband
as
meek
as
a
lamb
her
vapours
to
still
first
grants
her
her
will
and
the
quieting
draught
is
a
dram
poor
man
and
the
quieting
draught
is
a
dram
i
wish
all
our
quarrels
might
have
so
comfortable
a
reconciliation
polly
i
have
no
excuse
for
my
own
behaviour
madam
but
my
and
really
madam
i
suffer
too
upon
your
account
lucy
but
miss
polly
in
the
way
of
friendship
will
you
give
me
leave
to
propose
a
glass
of
cordial
to
you
polly
are
apt
to
give
me
the
headache
i
hope
madam
you
will
excuse
me
lucy
not
the
greatest
lady
in
the
land
could
have
better
in
her
closet
for
her
own
private
you
seem
mighty
low
in
spirits
my
dear
polly
i
am
sorry
madam
my
health
will
not
allow
me
to
accept
of
your
i
should
not
have
left
you
in
the
rude
manner
i
did
when
we
met
last
madam
had
not
my
papa
haul
me
away
so
unexpectedly
i
was
indeed
somewhat
provok
and
perhaps
might
use
some
expressions
that
were
but
really
madam
the
captain
treated
me
with
so
much
contempt
and
cruelty
that
i
deserv
your
pity
rather
than
your
resentment
lucy
but
since
his
escape
no
doubt
all
matters
are
made
up
polly
polly
is
i
am
the
unhappy
wife
and
he
loves
you
as
if
you
were
only
his
mistress
polly
sure
madam
you
can
not
think
me
so
happy
as
to
be
the
object
of
your
a
man
is
always
afraid
of
a
woman
who
loves
him
too
well
so
that
i
must
expect
to
be
neglected
and
avoided
lucy
then
our
cases
my
dear
polly
are
exactly
alike
both
of
us
indeed
have
been
too
fond
air
xlviii
o
bessy

polly
a
curse
attend
that
woman

who
always
would
be
pleasing
lucy
the
pertness
of
the
billing
dove
like
tickling
is
but
teazing
polly
what
then
in
love
can
woman
do
lucy
if
we
grow
fond
they
shun
us
polly
and
when
we
fly
them
they
pursue
lucy
but
leave
us
when
they
won
us
lucy
love
is
so
very
whimsical
in
both
sexes
that
it
is
impossible
to
be
but
my
heart
is
particular
and
contradicts
my
own
observation
polly
but
really
mistress
lucy
by
his
last
behaviour
i
think
i
ought
to
envy
when
i
was
forc
from
him
he
did
not
shew
the
least
but
perhaps
he
hath
a
heart
not
capable
of
it

would
fate
to
me
belinda
give

their

dispossess

gold

of

chorus

jailor
four
women
more
captain
with
a
child
apiece
see
here
they

i

ready

guarded
to

player
and
beggar
player
but
honest
friend
i
hope
you
do
intend
that
macheath
shall
be
really
executed
beggar
most
certainly
to
make
the
piece
perfect
i
was
for
doing
strict
poetical
macheath
is
to
be
hang
and
for
the
other
personages
of
the
drama
the
audience
must
have
suppos
they
were
all
either
hang
or
transported
player
why
then
friend
this
is
a
downright
deep
tragedy
the
catastrophe
is
manifestly
wrong
for
an
opera
must
end
happily
beggar
your
objection
sir
is
very
just
and
is
easily
remov
for
you
must
allow
that
in
this
kind
of
drama
is
no
matter
how
absurdly
things
are
brought
about
so
you
rabble
there
run
and
cry
a
reprieve
let
the
prisoner
be
brought
back
to
his
wives
in
triumph
player
all
this
we
must
do
to
comply
with
the
taste
of
the
town
beggar
through
the
whole
piece
you
may
observe
such
a
similitude
of
manners
in
high
and
low
life
that
it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether
in
the
fashionable
vices
the
fine
gentlemen
imitate
the
gentlemen
of
the
road
or
the
gentlemen
of
the
road
the
fine
had
the
play
remained
as
i
at
first
intended
it
would
have
carried
a
most
excellent
moral
have
shewn
that
the
lower
sort
of
people
have
their
vices
in
a
degree
as
well
as
the
rich
and
that
they
are
punish
for
them
to
them
macheath
with
rabble
macheath
so
it
seems
i
am
not
left
to
my
choice
but
must
have
a
wife
at
look
ye
my
dears
we
will
have
no
controversy
now
let
us
give
this
day
to
mirth
and
i
am
sure
she
who
thinks
herself
my
wife
will
testify
her
joy
by
a
dance
all
come
a
dance
a
dance
macheath
ladies
i
hope
you
will
give
me
leave
to
present
a
partner
to
each
of
you
and
if
i
may
without
offence
for
this
time
i
take
polly
for
and
for
life
you
slut
for
we
were
really
as
for
the
but
at
present
keep
your
own
secret
to
polly
a
dance
air
lxviii
lumps
of
pudding
thus
i
stand
like
the
turk
with
his
doxies
around
from
all
sides
their
glances
his
passion
confound
for
black
brown
and
fair
his
inconstancy
burns
and
the
different
beauties
subdue
him
by
turns
each
calls
forth
her
charms
to
provoke
his
desires
though
willing
to
all
with
but
one
he
retires
but
think
of
this
maxim
and
put
off
your
sorrow
the
wretch
of
may
be
happy
chorus
but
think
of
this
maxim
