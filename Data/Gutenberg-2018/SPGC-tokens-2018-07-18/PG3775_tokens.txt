napoleon
bonaparte
by
john
abbott
napoleon
finding
his
proffers
of
peace
rejected
by
england
with
contumely
and
scorn
and
declined
by
austria
now
prepared
with
his
wonted
energy
to
repel
the
assaults
of
the
allies
as
he
sat
in
his
cabinet
at
the
tuileries
the
thunders
of
their
unrelenting
onset
came
rolling
in
upon
his
ear
from
all
the
frontiers
of
france
the
hostile
fleets
of
england
swept
the
channel
utterly
annihilating
the
commerce
of
the
republic
landing
regiments
of
armed
emigrants
upon
her
coast
furnishing
money
and
munitions
of
war
to
rouse
the
partisans
of
the
bourbons
to
civil
conflict
and
throwing
balls
and
shells
into
every
unprotected
town
on
the
northern
frontier
marshal
kray
came
thundering
down
through
the
black
forest
to
the
banks
of
the
rhine
with
a
mighty
host
of
men
like
locust
legions
to
pour
into
all
the
northern
provinces
of
france
artillery
of
the
heaviest
calibre
and
a
magnificent
array
of
cavalry
accompanied
this
apparently
invincible
army
in
italy
melas
another
austrian
marshal
with
men
aided
by
the
whole
force
of
the
british
navy
was
rushing
upon
the
eastern
and
southern
borders
of
the
republic
the
french
troops
disheartened
by
defeat
had
fled
before
their
foes
over
the
alps
or
were
eating
their
horses
and
their
boots
in
the
cities
where
they
were
besieged
from
almost
every
promontory
on
the
coast
of
the
republic
washed
by
the
channel
or
the
mediterranean
the
eye
could
discern
english
frigates
black
and
threatening
holding
all
france
in
a
state
of
blockade
one
always
finds
a
certain
pleasure
in
doing
that
which
he
can
do
well
napoleon
was
fully
conscious
of
his
military
genius
he
had
in
behalf
of
bleeding
humanity
implored
peace
in
vain
he
now
with
alacrity
and
with
joy
roused
himself
to
inflict
blows
that
should
be
felt
upon
his
multitudinous
enemies
with
such
tremendous
energy
did
he
do
this
that
he
received
from
his
antagonists
the
most
complimentary
sobriquet
of
the
one
hundred
thousand
men
wherever
napoleon
made
his
appearance
in
the
field
his
presence
alone
was
considered
equivalent
to
that
force
the
following
proclamation
rang
like
a
trumpet
charge
over
the
hills
and
valleys
of
france
frenchmen
you
have
been
anxious
for
peace
your
government
has
desired
it
with
still
greater
ardor
its
first
efforts
its
most
constant
wishes
have
been
for
its
attainment
the
english
ministry
has
exposed
the
secret
of
its
iniquitous
policy
it
wishes
to
dismember
france
to
destroy
its
commerce
and
either
to
erase
it
from
the
map
of
europe
or
to
degrade
it
to
a
secondary
power
england
is
willing
to
embroil
all
the
nations
of
the
continent
in
hostility
with
each
other
that
she
may
enrich
herself
with
their
spoils
and
gain
possession
of
the
trade
of
the
world
for
the
attainment
of
this
object
she
scatters
her
gold
becomes
prodigal
of
her
promises
and
multiplies
her
intrigues
at
this
call
all
the
martial
spirit
of
france
rushed
to
arms
napoleon
supremely
devoted
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
seemed
to
forget
even
his
own
glory
in
the
intensity
of
his
desire
to
make
france
victorious
over
her
foes
with
the
most
magnanimous
superiority
to
all
feelings
of
jealousy
he
raised
an
army
of
men
the
very
elite
of
the
troops
of
france
the
veterans
of
a
hundred
battles
and
placed
them
in
the
hands
of
moreau
the
only
man
in
france
who
could
be
called
his
rival
napoleon
also
presented
to
moreau
the
plan
of
a
campaign
in
accordance
with
his
own
energy
boldness
and
genius
its
accomplishment
would
have
added
surpassing
brilliance
to
the
reputation
of
moreau
but
the
cautious
general
was
afraid
to
adopt
it
and
presented
another
perhaps
as
safe
but
one
which
would
produce
no
dazzling
impression
upon
the
imaginations
of
men
your
plan
said
one
a
friend
of
moreau
to
the
first
consul
is
grander
more
decisive
even
more
sure
but
it
is
not
adapted
to
the
slow
and
cautious
genius
of
the
man
who
is
to
execute
it
you
have
your
method
of
making
war
which
is
superior
to
all
others
moreau
has
his
own
inferior
certainly
but
still
excellent
leave
him
to
himself
if
you
impose
your
ideas
upon
him
you
will
wound
his
and
disconcert
him
napoleon
profoundly
versed
in
the
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
promptly
replied
you
are
right
moreau
is
not
capable
of
grasping
the
plan
which
i
have
conceived
let
him
follow
his
own
course
the
plan
which
he
does
not
understand
and
dare
not
execute
i
myself
will
carry
out
on
another
part
of
the
theatre
of
war
what
he
fears
to
attempt
on
the
rhine
i
will
accomplish
on
the
alps
the
day
may
come
when
he
will
regret
the
glory
which
he
yields
to
me
these
were
proud
and
prophetic
words
moreau
was
moderately
victorious
upon
the
rhine
driving
back
the
invaders
the
sun
of
napoleon
soon
rose
over
the
field
of
marengo
in
a
blaze
of
effulgence
which
paled
moreau
twinkling
star
into
utter
obscurity
but
we
know
not
where
upon
the
page
of
history
to
find
an
act
of
more
lofty
generosity
than
this
surrender
of
the
noblest
army
of
the
republic
to
one
who
considered
himself
and
who
was
deemed
by
others
a
rival
and
thus
to
throw
open
to
him
the
theatre
of
war
where
apparently
the
richest
laurels
were
to
be
won
and
he
know
where
to
look
for
a
deed
more
proudly
expressive
of
i
will
give
moreau
said
he
by
this
act
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
of
the
most
brave
and
disciplined
soldiers
of
france
the
victors
of
a
hundred
battles
i
myself
will
take
sixty
thousand
men
new
recruits
and
the
fragments
of
regiments
which
remain
and
with
them
i
will
march
to
encounter
an
equally
powerful
enemy
on
a
more
difficult
field
of
warfare
marshal
melas
had
spread
his
vast
host
of
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
austrians
through
all
the
strongholds
of
italy
and
was
pressing
with
tremendous
energy
and
upon
the
frontiers
of
france
napoleon
instead
of
marching
with
his
inexperienced
troops
of
whom
had
never
seen
a
shot
fired
in
earnest
to
meet
the
heads
of
the
triumphant
columns
of
melas
resolved
to
climb
the
rugged
and
apparently
inaccessible
fastnesses
of
the
alps
and
descending
from
the
clouds
over
precipices
to
fall
with
the
sweep
of
the
avalanche
upon
their
rear
it
was
necessary
to
assemble
this
army
at
some
favorable
point
to
gather
in
vast
magazines
its
munitions
of
war
it
was
necessary
that
this
should
be
done
in
secret
lest
the
austrians
climbing
to
the
summits
of
the
alps
and
defending
the
gorges
through
which
the
troops
of
napoleon
would
be
compelled
to
wind
their
difficult
and
tortuous
way
might
render
the
passage
utterly
impossible
english
and
austrian
spies
were
prompt
to
communicate
to
the
hostile
powers
every
movement
of
the
first
consul
napoleon
fixed
upon
dijon
and
its
vicinity
as
the
rendezvous
of
his
troops
he
however
adroitly
and
completely
deceived
his
foes
by
ostentatiously
announcing
the
very
plan
he
intended
to
carry
into
operation
of
course
the
allies
thought
that
this
was
a
foolish
attempt
to
draw
their
attention
from
the
real
point
of
attack
the
more
they
ridiculed
the
imaginary
army
at
dijon
the
more
loudly
did
napoleon
reiterate
his
commands
for
battalions
and
magazines
to
be
collected
there
the
spies
who
visited
dijon
reported
that
but
a
few
regiments
were
assembled
in
that
place
and
that
the
announcement
was
clearly
a
very
weak
pretense
to
deceive
the
print
shops
of
london
and
vienna
were
filled
with
caricatures
of
the
army
of
the
first
consul
of
dijon
the
english
especially
made
themselves
very
merry
with
napolcon
grand
army
to
scale
the
alps
it
was
believed
that
the
energies
the
republic
were
utterly
exhausted
in
raising
the
force
which
was
given
to
moreau
one
of
the
caricatures
represented
the
army
as
consisting
of
a
boy
dressed
in
his
father
clothes
shouldering
a
musket
which
he
could
with
difficulty
lift
and
eating
a
piece
of
gingerbread
and
an
old
man
with
one
arm
and
a
wooden
leg
the
artillery
consisted
of
a
rusty
blunderbuss
this
derision
was
just
what
napoleon
desired
though
dwelling
in
the
shadow
of
that
mysterious
melancholy
which
ever
enveloped
his
spirit
he
must
have
enjoyed
in
the
deep
recesses
of
his
soul
the
majestic
movements
of
his
plans
on
the
eastern
frontiers
of
france
there
surge
up
from
luxuriant
meadows
and
fields
and
hill
sides
the
majestic
ranges
of
the
alps
piercing
the
clouds
and
soaring
with
glittering
pinnacles
into
the
region
of
perpetual
ice
and
snow
vast
spurs
of
the
mountains
extend
on
each
side
opening
gloomy
gorges
and
frightful
detiles
through
which
foaming
torrents
rush
impetuously
walled
in
by
almost
precipitous
cliffs
whose
summits
crowned
with
melancholy
firs
are
inaccessible
to
the
foot
of
man
the
principal
pass
over
this
enormous
ridge
was
that
of
the
great
bernard
the
traveler
accompanied
by
a
guide
and
mounted
on
a
mule
slowly
and
painfully
ascended
a
steep
and
rugged
path
now
crossing
a
narrow
bridge
spanning
a
fathomless
abyss
again
creeping
along
the
edge
of
a
precipice
where
the
eagle
soared
and
screamed
over
the
fir
tops
in
the
abyss
below
and
where
a
perpendicular
wall
rose
to
giddy
heights
in
the
clouds
above
the
path
at
times
was
so
narrow
that
it
seemed
that
the
mountain
goat
could
with
difficulty
find
a
foothold
for
its
slender
hoof
a
false
step
or
a
slip
upon
the
icy
rocks
would
precipitate
the
traveler
a
mangled
corpse
a
thousand
feet
upon
the
fragments
of
granite
in
the
gulf
beneath
as
higher
and
higher
he
climbed
these
wild
and
rugged
and
paths
borne
by
the
unerring
instinct
of
the
faithful
mule
his
steps
were
often
arrested
by
the
roar
of
the
avalanche
and
he
gazed
appalled
upon
its
resistless
rush
as
rocks
and
trees
and
earth
and
snow
and
ice
swept
by
him
with
awful
and
resistless
desolation
far
down
into
the
dimly
discerned
torrents
which
rushed
beneath
his
feet
at
god
bidding
the
avalanche
fell
no
precaution
could
save
the
traveler
who
was
in
its
path
he
was
instantly
borne
to
destruction
and
buried
where
no
voice
but
the
archangel
trump
could
ever
reach
his
ear
terrific
storms
of
wind
and
snow
often
swept
through
those
bleak
altitudes
blinding
and
smothering
the
traveler
hundreds
of
bodies
like
pillars
of
ice
embalmed
in
snow
are
now
sepulchred
in
those
drifts
there
to
sleep
till
the
fires
of
the
last
conflagration
shall
have
consumed
their
winding
sheet
having
toiled
two
days
through
such
scenes
of
desolation
and
peril
the
adventurous
traveler
stands
upon
the
summit
of
the
pass
eight
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
two
thousand
feet
higher
than
the
crest
of
mount
washington
our
own
mountain
monarch
this
summit
over
which
the
path
winds
consists
of
a
small
level
plain
surrounded
by
mountains
of
snow
of
still
higher
elevation
the
scene
here
presented
is
inexpressibly
gloomy
and
appailing
nature
in
these
wild
regions
assumes
her
most
severe
and
sombre
aspect
as
one
emerges
from
the
precipitous
and
craggy
ascent
upon
this
valley
of
desolation
as
it
is
emphatically
called
the
convent
of
bernard
presents
itself
to
the
view
this
cheerless
abode
the
highest
spot
of
inhabited
ground
in
europe
has
been
tenanted
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
by
a
succession
of
joyless
and
monks
who
in
that
frigid
retreat
of
granite
and
ice
endeavor
to
serve
their
maker
by
rescuing
bewildered
travelers
from
the
destruction
with
which
they
are
ever
threatened
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
storms
which
battle
against
them
in
the
middle
of
this
valley
lies
a
lake
clear
dark
and
cold
whose
depths
even
in
reflect
the
eternal
glaciers
which
soar
sublimely
around
the
descent
to
the
plains
of
italy
is
even
more
precipitous
and
dangerous
than
the
ascent
from
the
green
pastures
of
france
no
vegetation
adorns
these
dismal
and
cliffs
of
granite
and
of
ice
even
the
pinion
of
the
eagle
fails
in
its
rarified
air
and
the
chamois
ventures
not
to
climb
its
steep
and
slippery
crags
no
human
beings
are
ever
to
be
seen
on
these
bleak
summits
except
the
few
shivering
travelers
who
tarry
for
an
hour
to
receive
the
hospitality
of
the
convent
and
the
hooded
monks
wrapped
in
thick
and
coarse
garments
which
their
staves
and
their
dogs
groping
through
the
storms
of
sleet
and
snow
even
the
wood
which
burns
with
frugal
faintness
on
the
hearths
is
borne
in
painful
burdens
up
the
mountain
sides
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
monks
such
was
the
barrier
which
napoleon
intended
to
surmount
that
he
might
fall
upon
the
rear
of
the
austrians
who
were
battering
down
the
walls
of
genoa
where
massena
was
besieged
and
who
were
thundering
flushed
with
victory
at
the
very
gates
of
nice
over
this
wild
mountain
pass
where
the
mule
could
with
difficulty
tread
and
where
no
wheel
had
ever
rolled
or
by
any
possibility
could
roll
napoleon
contemplated
transporting
an
army
of
sixty
thousand
men
with
ponderous
artillery
and
tons
of
cannon
balls
and
baggage
and
all
the
bulky
munitions
of
war
england
and
austria
laughed
the
idea
to
scorn
the
achievement
of
such
an
enterprise
was
apparently
impossible
napoleon
however
was
as
skillful
in
the
arrangement
of
the
minutest
details
as
in
the
conception
of
the
grandest
combinations
though
he
resolved
to
take
the
mass
of
his
army
forty
thousand
strong
across
the
pass
of
the
great
bernard
yet
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
austrians
he
arranged
also
to
send
small
divisions
across
the
passes
of
saint
gothard
little
bernard
and
mount
cenis
he
would
thus
accumulate
suddenly
and
to
the
utter
amazement
of
the
enemy
a
body
of
thousand
men
upon
the
plain
of
italy
this
force
descending
like
an
apparition
from
the
clouds
in
the
rear
of
the
austrian
army
headed
by
napoleon
and
cutting
off
all
communication
with
austria
might
indeed
strike
a
panic
into
the
hearts
of
the
assailants
of
france
the
troops
were
collected
in
various
places
in
the
vicinity
of
dijon
ready
at
a
moment
warning
to
assemble
at
the
point
of
rendezvous
and
with
a
rush
to
enter
the
defile
immense
magazines
of
wheat
biscuit
and
oats
had
been
noiselessly
collected
in
different
places
large
sums
of
specie
had
been
forwarded
to
hire
the
services
of
every
peasant
with
his
mule
who
inhabited
the
valleys
among
the
mountains
mechanic
shops
as
by
magic
suddenly
rose
along
the
path
well
supplied
with
skillful
artisans
to
repair
all
damages
to
dismount
the
artillery
to
divide
the
and
the
into
fragments
that
they
might
be
transported
on
the
backs
of
men
and
mules
over
the
steep
and
rugged
way
for
the
ammunition
a
vast
number
of
small
boxes
were
prepared
which
could
easily
be
packed
upon
the
mules
a
second
company
of
mechanics
with
camp
forges
had
been
provided
to
cross
the
mountain
with
the
first
division
and
rear
their
shops
upon
the
plain
on
the
other
side
to
mend
the
broken
harness
to
reconstruct
the
carriages
and
remount
the
pieces
on
each
side
of
the
mountain
a
hospital
was
established
and
supplied
with
every
comfort
for
the
sick
and
the
wounded
the
foresight
of
napoleon
extended
even
to
sending
at
the
very
last
moment
to
the
convent
upon
the
summit
an
immense
quantity
of
bread
cheese
and
wine
each
soldier
to
his
surprise
was
to
find
as
he
arrived
at
the
summit
exhausted
with
herculean
toil
a
generous
slice
of
bread
and
cheese
with
a
refreshing
cup
of
wine
presented
to
him
by
the
monks
all
these
minute
details
napoleon
arranged
while
at
the
same
time
he
was
doing
the
work
of
a
dozen
energetic
men
in
reorganizing
the
whole
structure
of
society
in
france
if
toil
pays
for
greatness
napoleon
purchased
the
renown
which
he
attained
and
yet
his
body
and
his
mind
were
so
constituted
that
this
sleepless
activity
was
to
him
a
pleasure
the
appointed
hour
at
last
arrived
on
the
of
may
napoleon
entered
his
carriage
at
the
tuileries
saying
my
dear
josephine
i
must
go
to
italy
i
shall
not
forget
you
and
i
will
not
be
absent
long
at
a
word
the
whole
majestic
array
was
in
motion
like
a
meteor
he
swept
over
france
he
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
the
troops
and
all
the
paraphernalia
of
war
were
on
the
spot
at
the
designated
hour
napoleon
immediately
appointed
a
very
careful
inspection
every
foot
soldier
and
every
horseman
passed
before
his
scrutinizing
eye
if
a
shoe
was
ragged
or
a
jacket
torn
or
a
musket
injured
the
defect
was
immediately
repaired
his
glowing
words
inspired
the
troops
with
the
ardor
which
was
burning
in
his
own
bosom
the
genius
of
the
first
consul
was
infused
into
the
mighty
host
each
man
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
the
eye
of
their
chief
was
every
where
and
his
cheering
voice
roused
the
army
to
almost
exertions
two
skillful
engineers
had
been
sent
to
explore
the
path
and
to
do
what
could
be
done
in
the
removal
of
obstructions
they
returned
with
an
appalling
recitasl
of
the
apparently
insurmountable
difficulties
of
the
way
is
it
possible
inquired
napoleon
to
cross
the
pass
perhaps
was
the
hesitating
reply
it
is
within
the
limits
of
possibility
forward
then
was
the
energetic
response
each
man
was
required
to
carry
besides
his
arms
food
for
several
days
and
a
large
quantity
of
cartridges
as
the
sinuosities
of
the
precipitous
path
could
only
be
trod
in
single
file
the
heavy
wheels
were
taken
from
the
carriages
and
each
slung
upon
a
pole
was
borne
by
two
men
the
task
for
the
foot
soldiers
was
far
less
than
for
the
horsemen
the
latter
clambered
up
on
foot
dragging
their
horses
after
them
the
descent
was
very
dangerous
the
dragoon
in
the
steep
and
narrow
path
was
compelled
to
walk
before
his
horse
at
the
least
stumble
he
was
exposed
to
being
plunged
headlong
into
the
abysses
yawning
before
him
in
this
way
many
horses
and
several
riders
perished
to
transport
the
heavy
cannon
and
howitzers
pine
logs
were
split
in
the
centre
the
parts
hollowed
out
and
the
guns
sunks
into
grooves
a
long
string
of
mules
in
single
file
were
attached
to
the
ponderous
machines
of
war
to
drag
them
up
the
slippery
ascent
the
mules
soon
began
to
fail
and
then
the
men
with
hearty
brought
their
own
shoulders
into
the
harness
a
hundred
men
to
a
single
gun
napoleon
offered
the
peasants
two
hundred
dollars
for
the
transporation
of
a
over
the
pass
the
love
of
gain
was
not
strong
enough
to
lure
them
to
such
tremendous
exertions
but
napoleon
fascination
over
the
hearts
of
his
soldiers
was
a
more
powerful
impulse
with
shouts
of
encouragement
they
toiled
at
the
cables
successive
bands
of
a
hundred
men
relieving
each
other
every
half
hour
high
on
those
craggy
steeps
gleaming
through
the
midst
the
glittering
bands
of
armed
men
like
phantoms
appeared
the
eagle
wheeled
and
screamed
beneath
their
feet
the
mountain
goat
affrighted
by
the
unwonted
spectacle
bounded
away
and
paused
in
bold
relief
upon
the
cliff
to
gaze
upon
the
martial
array
which
so
suddenly
had
peopled
the
solitude
when
they
approached
any
spot
of
very
especial
difficulty
the
trumpets
sounded
the
charge
which
with
sublime
reverberations
from
pinnacle
to
pinnacle
of
rock
and
ice
animated
by
these
bugle
notes
the
soldiers
strained
every
nerve
as
if
rushing
upon
the
foe
napoleon
offered
to
these
bands
the
same
reward
which
he
had
promised
to
the
peasants
but
to
a
man
they
refused
the
gold
they
had
imbibed
the
spirit
of
their
chief
his
enthusiasm
and
his
proud
superiority
to
all
mercenary
motives
we
are
not
toiling
for
money
said
they
but
for
your
approval
and
to
share
your
glory
napoleon
with
his
wonderful
tact
had
introduced
a
slight
change
into
the
artillery
service
which
was
productive
of
immense
moral
results
the
gun
carriages
had
heretofore
been
driven
by
mere
wagoners
who
being
considered
not
as
soldiers
but
as
servants
and
sharing
not
in
the
glory
of
victory
were
uninfluenced
by
any
sentiment
of
honor
at
the
first
approach
of
danger
they
were
ready
to
cut
their
traces
and
gallop
from
the
field
leaving
their
cannon
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
napoleon
said
the
cannoneer
who
brings
his
piece
into
action
performs
as
valuable
a
service
as
the
cannoneer
who
works
it
he
runs
the
same
danger
and
requires
the
same
moral
stimulus
which
is
the
sense
of
honor
he
therefore
converted
the
artillery
drivers
into
soldiers
and
clothed
them
in
the
uniform
of
their
respective
regiments
they
constituted
twelve
thousand
horsemen
who
were
animated
with
as
much
pride
in
carrying
their
pieces
into
action
and
in
bringing
them
off
with
rapidity
and
safety
as
the
gunners
felt
in
loading
directing
and
discharging
them
it
was
now
the
great
glory
of
these
men
to
take
care
of
their
guns
they
loved
tenderly
the
merciless
monsters
they
lavished
caresses
and
terms
of
endearment
upon
the
glittering
polished
brass
the
heart
of
man
is
a
strange
enigma
even
when
most
degraded
it
needs
something
to
love
these
soldiers
brutalized
by
vice
amidst
all
the
honors
of
battle
lovingly
fondled
the
murderous
machines
of
war
responding
to
the
appeal
call
me
pet
names
dearest
the
unrelenting
gun
was
the
stern
cannoneer
lady
love
he
kissed
it
with
unwashed
mustached
lip
in
rude
and
rough
devotion
he
was
ready
to
die
rather
than
abandon
the
only
object
of
his
idolatrous
homage
consistently
he
baptized
the
monster
with
blood
affectionately
he
named
it
mary
emma
lizzie
in
crossing
he
alps
dark
night
came
on
as
some
cannoneers
were
floundering
through
drifts
of
snow
toiling
at
their
gun
they
would
not
leave
the
gun
alone
in
the
cold
storm
to
seek
for
themselves
a
dry
bivouac
but
like
brothers
guarding
a
sister
they
threw
themselves
for
the
night
upon
the
bleak
and
frozen
snow
by
its
side
it
was
the
genius
of
napoleon
which
thus
penetrated
these
mysterious
depths
of
the
human
soul
and
called
to
his
aid
those
mighty
energies
it
is
nothing
but
imagination
said
one
once
to
napoleon
nothing
but
imagination
he
rejoined
imagination
rules
the
world
when
they
arrived
at
the
summit
each
soldier
found
to
his
surprise
and
joy
the
abundant
comforts
which
napoleon
kind
care
had
provided
one
would
have
anticipated
there
a
scene
of
terrible
confusion
to
feed
an
army
of
forty
thousand
hungry
men
is
not
a
light
undertaking
yet
every
thing
was
so
carefully
arranged
and
the
influence
of
napoleon
so
boundless
that
not
a
soldier
left
the
ranks
each
man
received
his
slice
of
bread
and
cheese
and
quaffed
his
cup
of
wine
and
passed
on
it
was
a
point
of
honor
for
no
one
to
stop
whatever
obstructions
were
in
the
way
were
to
be
at
all
hazards
surmounted
that
the
long
file
extending
nearly
twenty
miles
might
not
be
thrown
into
confusion
the
descent
was
more
perilous
than
the
ascent
but
fortune
seemed
to
smile
the
sky
was
clear
the
weather
delightful
and
in
four
days
the
whole
army
was
reassembled
on
the
plains
of
italy
napoleon
had
sent
bertlier
forward
to
receive
the
division
and
to
superintend
all
necessary
repairs
while
he
himself
remained
to
press
forward
the
mighty
host
he
was
the
last
man
to
cross
the
mountains
seated
upon
a
mule
with
a
young
peasant
for
his
guide
slowly
and
thoughtfully
he
ascended
those
silent
solitudes
he
was
dressed
in
the
gray
great
coat
which
he
always
wore
art
pictured
him
bounding
up
the
cliff
proudly
mounted
on
a
prancing
charger
but
truth
presents
him
in
an
attitude
more
simple
and
more
sublime
even
the
young
peasant
who
acted
as
his
guide
was
entirely
unconscious
of
the
distinguished
rank
of
the
plain
traveler
whose
steps
he
was
conducting
much
of
the
way
napoleon
was
silent
abstracted
in
thoughts
and
yet
he
found
time
for
human
sympathy
he
drew
from
his
young
and
artless
guide
the
secrets
of
his
heart
the
young
peasant
was
sincere
and
virtuous
he
loved
a
fair
maid
among
the
mountains
she
loved
him
it
was
his
heart
great
desire
to
have
her
for
his
own
he
was
poor
and
had
neither
house
nor
land
to
support
a
family
napoleon
struggling
with
all
his
energies
against
combined
england
and
austria
and
with
all
the
cares
of
an
army
on
the
march
to
meet
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
foes
crowding
his
mind
with
pensive
sympathy
won
the
confidence
of
his
companion
and
elicited
this
artless
recital
of
love
and
desire
as
napoleon
dismissed
his
guide
with
an
ample
reward
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
pencil
and
upon
a
loose
piece
of
paper
wrote
a
few
lines
which
he
requested
the
young
man
to
give
on
his
return
to
the
administrator
of
the
army
upon
the
other
side
when
the
guide
returned
and
presented
the
note
he
found
to
his
unbounded
surprise
and
delight
that
he
had
conducted
napoleon
over
the
mountains
and
that
napoleon
had
given
him
a
field
and
a
house
he
was
thus
enabled
to
be
married
and
to
realize
all
the
dreams
of
his
modest
ambition
generous
impulses
must
have
been
instinctive
in
a
heart
which
in
an
hour
so
fraught
with
mighty
events
could
turn
from
the
toils
of
empire
and
of
war
to
find
refreshment
in
sympathizing
with
a
love
this
young
man
but
recently
died
having
passed
his
quiet
life
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
field
and
the
cottage
which
had
been
given
him
by
the
ruler
of
the
world
the
army
now
pressed
forward
with
great
alacrity
along
the
banks
of
the
aosta
they
were
threading
a
beautiful
valley
rich
in
verdure
and
blooming
beneath
the
sun
of
early
spring
cottages
vineyards
and
orchards
in
full
bloom
embellished
their
path
while
upon
each
side
of
them
rose
in
majestic
swell
the
sides
of
the
mountains
the
austrians
pressing
against
the
frontiers
of
france
had
no
conception
of
the
storm
which
had
so
suddenly
gathered
and
which
was
with
resistless
sweep
approaching
their
rear
the
french
soldiers
elated
with
the
herculean
achievement
they
had
accomplished
and
full
of
confidence
in
their
leader
pressed
gayly
on
but
the
valley
before
them
began
to
grow
more
and
more
narrow
the
mountains
on
either
side
rose
more
precipitous
and
craggy
the
aosta
crowded
into
a
narrow
channel
rushed
foaming
over
the
rocks
leaving
barely
room
for
a
road
along
the
side
of
the
mountain
suddenly
the
march
of
the
whole
army
was
arrested
by
a
fort
built
upon
an
inaccessible
rock
which
rose
pyramidally
from
the
bed
of
the
stream
bristling
cannon
skillfully
arranged
on
bastions
swept
the
pass
and
rendered
further
advance
apparently
impossible
rapidly
the
tidings
of
this
unexpected
obstruction
spread
from
the
van
to
the
rear
napoleon
immediately
hastened
to
the
front
ranks
climbing
the
mountain
opposite
the
fort
by
a
goat
path
he
threw
himself
down
upon
the
ground
when
a
few
bushes
concealed
his
person
from
the
shot
of
the
enemy
and
with
his
telescope
long
and
carefully
examined
the
fort
and
the
surrounding
crags
he
perceived
one
elevated
spot
far
above
the
fort
where
a
cannon
might
by
possibility
be
drawn
from
that
position
its
shot
could
be
plunged
upon
the
unprotected
bastions
below
upon
the
face
of
the
opposite
cliff
far
beyond
the
reach
of
he
discerned
a
narrow
shelf
in
the
rock
by
which
he
thought
it
possible
that
a
man
could
pass
the
march
was
immediately
commenced
in
single
file
along
this
giddy
ridge
and
even
the
horses
insured
to
the
terrors
of
the
great
bernard
were
led
by
their
riders
upon
the
narrow
path
which
a
horse
hoof
had
never
trod
before
and
probably
will
never
tread
again
the
austrians
in
the
fort
had
the
mortification
of
seeing
thousand
soldiers
with
numerous
horses
defile
along
this
airy
line
as
if
adhering
to
the
side
of
the
rock
but
neither
bullet
nor
ball
could
harm
them
napoleon
ascended
this
mountain
ridge
and
upon
its
summit
quite
exhausted
with
days
and
nights
of
sleeplessness
and
toil
laid
himself
down
in
the
shadow
of
the
rock
and
fell
asleep
the
long
line
filed
carefully
and
silently
by
each
soldier
hushing
his
comrade
that
the
repose
of
their
beloved
chieftain
might
not
be
disturbed
it
was
an
interesting
spectacle
to
witness
the
tender
affection
beaming
from
the
countenances
of
these
bronzed
and
veterans
as
every
foot
trod
softly
and
each
eye
in
passing
was
riveted
upon
the
slender
form
and
upon
the
pale
and
wasted
cheek
of
the
sleeping
napoleon
the
artillery
could
by
no
possibility
be
thus
transported
and
an
army
without
artillery
is
a
soldier
without
weapons
the
austrian
commander
wrote
to
melas
that
he
had
seen
an
army
of
thousand
men
and
four
thousand
horse
creeping
by
the
fort
along
the
face
of
mount
albaredo
he
assured
the
however
that
not
one
single
piece
of
artillery
had
passed
or
could
pass
beneath
the
guns
of
his
fortress
when
he
was
writing
this
letter
already
had
one
half
of
the
cannon
and
ammunition
of
the
army
been
conveyed
by
the
fort
and
were
safely
and
rapidly
proceeding
on
their
way
down
the
valley
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
trusty
men
with
great
caution
and
silence
strewed
hay
and
straw
upon
the
road
the
wheels
of
the
lumbering
carriages
were
carefully
bound
with
cloths
and
wisps
of
straw
and
with
axles
well
oiled
were
drawn
by
the
hands
of
these
picked
men
beneath
the
very
walls
of
the
fortress
and
within
half
of
its
guns
in
two
nights
the
artillery
and
the
were
thus
passed
along
and
in
a
few
days
the
fort
itself
was
compelled
to
surrender
melas
the
austrian
commander
now
awoke
in
consternation
to
a
sense
of
his
peril
napoleon
the
dreaded
napoleon
had
as
by
a
miracle
crossed
the
alps
he
had
cut
off
all
his
supplies
and
was
shutting
the
austrians
up
from
any
possibility
of
retreat
bewildered
by
the
magnitude
of
his
peril
he
no
longer
thought
of
forcing
his
march
upon
paris
the
invasion
of
france
was
abandoned
his
whole
energies
were
directed
to
opening
for
himself
a
passage
back
to
austria
the
most
cruel
perplexities
agitated
him
from
the
very
pinnacle
of
victory
he
was
in
danger
of
descending
to
the
deepest
abyss
of
defeat
it
was
also
with
napoleon
an
hour
of
intense
solicitude
he
had
but
sixty
thousand
men
of
whom
were
new
soldiers
who
had
never
seen
a
shot
fired
in
earnest
with
whom
he
was
to
arrest
the
march
of
a
desperate
army
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
veterans
abundantly
provided
with
all
the
most
efficient
machinery
of
war
there
were
many
paths
by
which
melas
might
escape
at
leagues
distance
from
each
other
it
was
necessary
for
napoleon
to
divide
his
little
band
that
he
might
guard
them
all
he
was
liable
at
any
moment
to
have
a
division
of
his
army
attacked
by
an
overwhelming
force
and
cut
to
pieces
before
it
could
receive
any
reinforcements
he
ate
not
he
slept
not
he
rested
not
day
and
night
and
night
and
day
he
was
on
horseback
pale
pensive
apparently
in
feeble
health
and
interesting
every
beholder
with
his
grave
and
melancholy
beauty
his
scouts
were
out
in
every
direction
he
studied
all
the
possible
movements
and
combinations
of
his
foes
rapidly
he
overran
lombardy
and
entered
milan
in
triumph
melas
anxiously
concentrated
his
forces
to
break
through
the
net
with
which
he
was
entangled
he
did
every
thing
in
his
power
to
deceive
napoleon
by
various
feints
that
the
point
of
his
contemplated
attack
might
not
be
known
napoleon
in
the
following
clarion
tones
appealed
to
the
enthusiasm
of
his
troops
soldiers
when
we
began
our
march
one
department
of
france
was
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
consternation
pervaded
the
south
of
the
republic
you
advanced
already
the
french
territory
is
delivered
joy
and
hope
in
our
country
have
succeeded
to
consternation
and
fear
the
enemy
seeks
only
to
regain
his
frontiers
you
have
taken
his
hospitals
his
magazines
his
reserve
parks
the
first
act
of
the
campaign
is
finished
millions
of
men
address
you
in
strains
of
praise
but
shall
we
allow
our
audacious
enemies
to
violate
with
impunity
the
territory
of
the
republic
will
you
permit
the
army
to
escape
which
has
carried
terror
into
your
families
you
will
not
march
then
to
meet
him
tear
from
his
brows
the
laurels
he
has
won
teach
the
world
that
a
malediction
attends
those
who
violate
the
territory
of
the
great
people
the
result
of
our
efforts
will
be
unclouded
glory
and
a
durable
peace
the
very
day
napoleon
left
paris
desaix
arrived
in
france
from
egypt
frank
sincere
upright
and
punctiliously
honorable
he
was
one
of
the
few
whom
napoleon
truly
loved
desaix
regarded
napoleon
as
infinitely
his
superior
and
looked
up
to
him
with
a
species
of
adoration
he
loved
him
with
a
fervor
of
feeling
which
amounted
almost
to
a
passion
napoleon
touched
by
the
affection
of
a
heart
so
noble
requited
it
with
the
most
confiding
friendship
desaix
upon
his
arrival
in
paris
found
letters
for
him
there
from
the
first
consul
as
he
read
the
confidential
lines
he
was
struck
with
the
melancholy
air
with
which
they
were
pervaded
alas
said
he
napoleon
has
gained
every
thing
and
yet
he
is
unhappy
i
must
hasten
to
meet
him
without
delay
he
crossed
the
alps
and
arrived
at
the
of
napoleon
but
a
few
days
before
the
battle
of
marengo
they
passed
the
whole
night
together
talking
over
the
events
of
egypt
and
the
prospects
of
france
napoleon
felt
greatly
strengthened
by
the
arrival
of
his
noble
friend
and
immediately
assigned
to
him
the
command
of
a
division
of
the
army
desaix
said
he
is
my
sheet
anchor
you
have
had
a
long
interview
with
desaix
said
bourrienne
to
napoleon
the
next
morning
yes
he
replied
but
i
had
my
reasons
as
soon
as
i
return
to
paris
i
shall
make
him
minister
of
war
he
shall
always
be
my
lieutenant
i
would
make
him
a
prince
if
i
could
he
is
of
the
heroic
mould
of
antiquity
napoleon
was
fully
aware
that
a
decisive
battle
would
soon
take
place
melas
was
rapidly
from
all
points
concentrating
his
army
the
following
laconic
and
characteristic
order
was
issued
by
the
first
consul
to
lannes
and
murat
gather
your
forces
at
the
river
stradella
on
the
or
at
the
latest
you
will
have
on
your
hands
fifteen
or
eighteen
thousand
austrians
meet
them
and
cut
them
to
pieces
it
will
be
so
many
enemies
less
upon
our
hands
on
the
day
of
the
decisive
battle
we
are
to
expect
with
the
entire
army
of
melas
the
prediction
was
true
an
austrian
force
advanced
eighteen
thousand
strong
lannes
met
them
upon
the
field
of
montebello
they
were
strongly
posted
with
batteries
ranged
upon
the
hill
sides
which
swept
the
whole
plain
it
was
of
the
utmost
moment
that
this
body
should
be
prevented
from
combining
with
the
other
vast
forces
of
the
austrians
lannes
had
but
eight
thousand
men
could
he
sustain
the
unequal
conflict
for
a
few
hours
victor
who
was
some
miles
in
the
rear
could
come
up
with
a
reserve
of
four
thousand
men
the
french
soldiers
fully
conscious
of
the
odds
against
which
they
were
to
contend
and
of
the
carnage
into
the
midst
of
which
they
were
plunging
with
shouts
of
enthusiasm
rushed
upon
their
foes
instantaneously
a
storm
of
from
all
the
batteries
swept
through
his
ranks
said
lannes
i
could
hear
the
bones
crash
in
my
division
like
glass
in
a
for
nine
long
hours
from
eleven
in
the
morning
till
eight
at
night
the
horrid
carnage
continued
again
and
again
the
mangled
bleeding
wasted
columns
were
rallied
to
the
charge
at
last
when
three
thousand
frenchmen
were
strewn
dead
upon
the
ground
the
austrians
broke
and
fled
leaving
also
three
thousand
mutilated
corpses
and
six
thousand
prisoners
behind
them
napoleon
hastening
to
the
aid
of
his
lieutenant
arrived
upon
the
field
just
in
time
to
see
the
battle
won
he
rode
up
to
lannes
the
intrepid
soldier
stood
in
the
midst
of
mounds
of
the
dead
his
sword
dripping
with
blood
in
his
exhausted
hand
his
face
blackened
with
powder
and
smoke
and
his
uniform
soiled
and
tattered
by
the
long
and
terrific
strife
napoleon
silently
but
proudly
smiled
upon
the
heroic
general
and
forgot
not
his
reward
from
this
battle
lannes
received
the
title
of
duke
of
montebello
a
title
by
which
his
family
is
distinguished
to
the
present
day
this
was
the
opening
of
the
campaign
it
inspired
the
french
with
enthusiasm
it
nerved
the
austrians
to
despair
melas
now
determined
to
make
a
desperate
effort
to
break
through
the
toils
napoleon
with
intense
solicitude
was
watching
every
movement
of
his
foe
knowing
not
upon
what
point
the
onset
would
fall
before
in
the
morning
of
the
of
june
melas
having
accumulated
forty
thousand
men
including
seven
thousand
cavalry
and
two
hundred
pieces
of
cannon
made
an
impetuous
assault
upon
the
french
but
twenty
thousand
in
number
drawn
up
upon
the
plain
of
marengo
desaix
with
a
reserve
of
six
thousand
men
was
at
such
a
distance
nearly
thirty
miles
from
marengo
that
he
could
not
possibly
be
recalled
before
the
close
of
the
day
the
danger
was
frightful
that
the
french
would
be
entirely
cut
to
pieces
before
any
succor
could
arrive
but
the
quick
ear
of
desaix
caught
the
sound
of
the
heavy
cannonade
as
it
came
booming
over
the
plain
like
distant
thunder
he
sprung
from
his
couch
and
listened
the
heavy
and
uninterrupted
roar
proclaimed
a
pitched
battle
and
he
was
alarmed
for
his
beloved
chief
immediately
he
roused
his
troops
and
they
started
upon
the
rush
to
succor
their
comrades
napoleon
dispatched
courier
after
courier
to
hurry
the
division
along
while
his
troops
stood
firm
through
terrific
hours
as
their
ranks
were
plowed
by
the
murderous
discharges
of
their
foes
at
last
the
destruction
was
too
awful
for
mortal
men
to
endure
many
divisions
of
the
army
broke
and
fled
crying
all
is
lost
save
himself
who
can
a
scene
of
frightful
disorder
ensued
the
whole
plain
was
covered
with
fugitive
swept
like
an
inundation
before
the
multitudinous
austrians
napoleon
still
held
a
few
squares
together
who
slowly
and
sullenly
retreated
while
two
hundred
pieces
of
artillery
closely
pressing
them
poured
incessant
death
into
their
ranks
every
foot
of
ground
was
left
encumbered
with
the
dead
it
was
now
three
in
the
afternoon
melas
exhausted
with
toil
and
assured
that
he
had
gained
a
complete
victory
left
zach
to
finish
the
work
he
retired
to
his
head
quarters
and
immediately
dispatched
couriers
all
over
europe
to
announce
the
great
victory
of
marengo
said
an
austrian
veteran
who
had
before
encountered
napoleon
at
arcola
and
rivoli
melas
is
too
sanguine
depend
upon
it
our
day
work
is
not
yet
done
napoleon
will
yet
be
upon
us
with
his
reserve
just
then
the
anxious
eye
of
the
first
consulespied
the
solid
columns
of
desaix
entering
the
plain
desaix
plunging
his
spurs
into
his
horse
outstripped
all
the
rest
and
galloped
into
the
presence
of
napoleon
as
he
cast
a
glance
over
the
wild
confusion
and
devastation
of
the
field
the
exclaimed
hurriedly
i
see
that
the
battle
is
lost
i
suppose
i
can
do
no
more
for
you
than
to
secure
your
retreat
by
no
means
napoleon
replied
with
apparently
as
much
composure
as
if
he
had
been
sitting
by
his
own
fireside
the
battle
i
trust
is
gained
charge
with
your
column
the
disordered
troops
will
rally
in
your
rear
like
a
rock
desaix
with
his
solid
phalanx
of
ten
thousand
men
met
the
billow
of
austrian
victory
at
the
same
time
napoleon
dispatched
an
order
to
kellerman
with
his
cavalry
to
charge
the
triumphant
column
of
the
austrians
in
flank
it
was
the
work
of
a
moment
and
the
whole
aspect
of
the
field
was
changed
napoleon
rode
along
the
lines
of
those
on
the
retreat
exclaiming
my
friends
we
have
retreated
far
enough
it
is
now
our
turn
to
advance
recollect
that
i
am
in
the
habit
of
sleeping
on
the
field
of
battle
the
fugitives
reanimated
by
the
arrival
of
the
reserve
immediately
rallied
in
their
rear
the
double
charge
in
front
and
flank
was
instantly
made
the
austrians
were
checked
and
staggered
a
perfect
tornado
of
bullets
from
division
swept
their
ranks
they
poured
an
answering
volley
into
the
bosoms
of
the
french
a
bullet
pierced
the
breast
of
desaix
and
he
fell
and
almost
immediately
expired
his
last
words
were
tell
the
first
consul
that
my
only
regret
in
dying
is
to
have
perished
before
having
done
enough
to
live
in
the
recollection
of
posterity
the
soldiers
who
devotedly
loved
him
saw
his
fall
and
rushed
more
madly
on
to
avenge
his
death
the
swollen
tide
of
uproar
confusion
and
dismay
now
turned
and
rolled
in
surging
billows
in
the
opposite
direction
hardly
one
moment
elapsed
before
the
austrians
flushed
with
victory
found
themselves
overwhelmed
by
defeat
in
the
midst
of
this
terrific
scene
an
aid
rode
up
to
napoleon
and
said
desaix
is
dead
but
a
moment
before
they
were
conversing
side
by
side
napoleon
pressed
his
forehead
convulsively
with
his
hand
and
exclaimed
mournfully
why
is
it
not
permitted
me
to
weep
victory
at
such
a
price
is
dear
the
french
now
made
the
welkin
ring
with
shouts
of
victory
indescribable
dismay
filled
the
austrian
ranks
as
wildly
they
rushed
before
their
unrelenting
pursuers
their
rout
was
utter
and
hopeless
when
the
sun
went
down
over
this
field
of
blood
after
twelve
hours
of
the
most
frightful
carnage
a
scene
was
presented
horrid
enough
to
appall
the
heart
of
a
demon
more
than
twenty
thousand
human
bodies
were
strewn
upon
the
ground
the
dying
and
the
dead
weltering
in
gore
and
in
every
conceivable
form
of
disfiguration
horses
with
limbs
torn
their
bodies
were
struggling
in
convulsive
agonies
fragments
of
guns
and
swords
and
of
military
wagons
of
every
kind
were
strewed
around
in
wild
ruin
frequent
piercing
cries
which
agony
extorted
from
the
lacerated
victims
of
war
rose
above
the
general
moanings
of
anguish
which
like
wailings
of
the
storm
fell
heavily
upon
the
ear
the
shades
of
night
were
now
descending
upon
this
awful
scene
of
misery
the
multitude
of
the
wounded
was
so
great
that
notwithstanding
the
utmost
exertions
of
the
surgeons
hour
after
hour
of
the
long
night
lingered
away
while
thousands
of
the
wounded
and
the
dying
bit
the
dust
in
their
agony
if
war
has
its
chivalry
and
its
pageantry
it
has
also
revolting
hideousness
and
demoniac
woe
the
young
the
noble
the
sanguine
were
writhing
there
in
agony
bullets
respect
not
beauty
they
tear
out
the
eye
and
shatter
the
jaw
and
rend
the
cheek
and
transform
the
human
face
divine
into
an
aspect
upon
which
one
can
not
gaze
but
with
horror
from
the
field
of
marengo
many
a
young
man
returned
to
his
home
so
multilated
as
no
longer
to
be
recognized
by
friends
and
passed
a
weary
life
in
repulsive
deformity
mercy
abandons
the
arena
of
battle
the
frantic
with
iron
hoof
tramples
upon
the
mangled
face
the
throbbing
and
inflamed
wounds
the
splintered
bones
and
heeds
not
the
shriek
of
torture
crushed
into
the
bloody
mire
by
the
ponderous
wheels
of
heavy
artillery
the
victim
of
barbaric
war
thinks
of
mother
and
father
and
sister
and
home
and
shrieks
and
moans
and
dies
his
body
is
stripped
by
the
vagabonds
who
follow
the
camp
his
naked
mangled
corpse
is
covered
with
a
few
of
earth
and
left
as
food
for
vultures
and
for
dogs
and
he
is
forgotten
forever
and
it
is
called
glory
he
who
loves
war
for
the
sake
of
its
excitements
its
pageantry
and
its
fancied
glory
is
the
most
eminent
of
all
the
dupes
of
folly
and
of
sin
he
who
loathes
war
with
inexpressible
loathing
who
will
do
everything
in
his
power
to
avert
the
dire
and
horrible
calamity
but
who
will
nevertheless
in
the
last
extremity
with
a
determined
spirit
encounter
all
its
perils
from
love
of
country
and
of
home
who
is
willing
to
sacrifice
himself
and
all
that
is
dear
to
him
in
life
to
promote
the
well
being
of
his
will
ever
receive
the
homage
of
the
world
and
we
also
fully
believe
that
he
will
receive
the
approval
of
god
washington
abhorred
war
in
all
its
forms
yet
he
braved
all
its
perils
for
the
carnage
of
the
field
of
marengo
napoleon
can
not
be
held
responsible
upon
england
and
austria
must
rest
all
the
guilt
of
that
awful
tragedy
napoleon
had
done
every
thing
he
could
do
to
stop
the
effusion
of
blood
he
had
sacrificed
the
instincts
of
pride
in
pleading
with
a
haughty
foe
for
peace
his
plea
was
unavailing
three
hundred
thousand
men
were
marching
upon
france
to
force
upon
her
a
detested
king
it
was
not
the
duty
of
france
to
submit
to
such
dictation
drawing
the
sword
in
napoleon
fought
and
conquered
te
deum
laudamus
it
is
not
possible
but
that
napoleon
must
have
been
elated
by
so
resplendent
a
victory
he
knew
that
marengo
would
be
classed
as
the
most
brilliant
of
his
achievements
the
blow
had
fallen
with
such
terrible
severity
that
the
haughty
allies
were
thoroughly
humbled
melas
was
now
at
his
mercy
napoleon
could
dictate
peace
upon
his
own
terms
yet
he
rode
over
the
field
of
his
victory
with
a
saddened
spirit
and
gazed
mournfully
upon
the
ruin
and
the
wretchedness
around
him
as
he
was
slowly
and
thoughtfully
passing
along
through
the
heaps
of
the
dead
with
which
the
ground
was
encumbered
he
met
a
number
of
carts
heavily
laden
with
the
wounded
torn
by
balls
and
bullets
and
fragments
of
shells
into
most
hideous
spectacles
of
deformity
as
the
heavy
wheels
lumbered
over
the
rough
ground
grating
the
splintered
bones
and
bruising
and
opening
afresh
the
inflamed
wounds
shrieks
of
torture
were
extorted
from
the
victims
napoleon
stopped
his
horse
and
uncovered
his
head
as
the
melancholy
procession
of
misfortune
and
woe
passed
along
turning
to
a
companion
he
said
we
can
not
but
regret
not
being
wounded
like
these
unhappy
men
that
we
might
share
their
sufferings
a
more
touching
expression
of
sympathy
never
has
been
recorded
he
who
says
that
this
was
hypocrisy
is
a
stranger
to
the
generous
impulses
of
a
noble
heart
this
instinctive
outburst
of
emotion
never
could
have
been
instigated
by
policy
napoleon
had
fearlessly
exposed
himself
to
every
peril
during
this
conflict
his
clothes
were
repeatedly
pierced
by
bullets
balls
struck
between
the
legs
of
his
horse
covering
him
with
earth
a
took
away
a
piece
of
the
boot
from
his
left
leg
and
a
portion
of
the
skin
leaving
a
scar
which
was
never
obliterated
before
napoleon
marched
for
italy
he
had
made
every
effort
in
his
power
for
the
attainment
of
peace
now
with
magnanimity
above
all
praise
without
waiting
for
the
first
advance
from
his
conquered
foes
he
wrote
again
imploring
peace
upon
the
field
of
marengo
having
scattered
all
his
enemies
like
chaff
before
him
with
the
smoke
of
the
conflict
still
darkening
the
air
and
the
groans
of
the
dying
swelling
upon
his
ears
laying
aside
all
the
formalities
of
state
with
heartfelt
feeling
and
earnestness
he
wrote
to
the
emperor
of
austria
this
extraordinary
epistle
was
thus
commenced
sire
it
is
on
the
field
of
battle
amid
the
sufferings
of
a
multitude
of
wounded
and
surrounded
by
fifteen
thousand
corpses
that
i
beseech
your
majesty
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
humanity
and
not
to
suffer
two
brave
nations
to
cut
each
others
throats
for
interests
not
their
own
it
is
my
part
to
press
this
upon
your
majesty
being
upon
the
very
theatre
of
war
your
majesty
heart
can
not
feel
it
so
keenly
as
does
mine
the
letter
was
long
and
most
eloquent
for
what
are
you
fighting
said
napoleon
for
religion
then
make
war
on
the
russians
and
the
english
who
are
the
enemies
of
your
faith
do
you
wish
to
guard
against
revolutionary
principles
it
is
this
very
war
which
has
extended
them
over
half
the
continent
by
extending
the
conquests
of
france
the
continuance
of
the
war
can
not
fail
to
diffuse
them
still
further
is
it
for
the
balance
of
europe
the
english
threaten
that
balance
far
more
than
does
france
for
they
have
become
the
masters
and
the
tyrants
of
commerce
and
are
beyond
the
reach
of
resistance
is
it
to
secure
the
interests
of
the
house
of
austria
let
us
then
execute
the
treaty
of
campo
formio
which
secures
to
your
majesty
large
indemnities
in
compensation
for
the
provinces
lost
in
the
netherlands
and
secures
them
to
you
where
you
most
wish
to
obtain
them
that
is
in
italy
your
majesty
may
send
negotiators
whither
you
will
and
we
will
add
to
the
treaty
of
campo
formio
stipulations
calculated
to
assure
you
of
the
continued
existence
of
the
secondary
states
of
all
which
the
french
republic
is
accused
of
having
shaken
upon
these
conditions
pace
is
made
if
you
will
let
us
make
the
armistice
general
for
all
the
armies
and
enter
into
negotiations
instantly
a
courier
was
immediately
dispatched
to
vienna
to
convey
this
letter
to
the
emperor
in
the
evening
bourrienne
hastened
to
congratulate
napoleon
upon
his
extraordinary
victory
what
a
glorious
day
said
bourrienne
yes
replied
napoleon
mournfully
very
glorious
could
i
this
evening
but
have
embraced
desaix
upon
the
field
of
battle
on
the
same
day
and
at
nearly
the
same
hour
in
which
the
fatal
bullet
pierced
the
breast
of
desaix
an
assassin
in
egypt
plunged
a
dagger
into
the
bosom
of
kleber
the
spirits
of
these
illustrious
men
these
warriors
thus
unexpectedly
met
in
the
there
they
wander
now
how
impenetrable
the
vail
which
shuts
their
destiny
from
our
view
the
soul
longs
for
clearer
vision
of
that
world
people
by
the
innumerable
host
of
the
mighty
dead
there
napoleon
now
dwells
does
he
retain
his
intellectual
supremacy
do
his
generals
gather
around
him
with
love
and
homage
has
his
pensive
spirit
sunk
down
into
gloom
and
despair
or
has
it
soared
into
cloudless
regions
of
purity
and
peace
the
mystery
of
death
death
alone
can
solve
it
christianity
with
its
lofty
revealings
sheds
but
dim
twilight
upon
the
world
off
departed
spirits
at
helena
napoleon
said
of
all
the
general
i
ever
had
under
my
command
desaix
and
kleber
possessed
the
greatest
talent
in
particular
desaix
as
kleber
loved
glory
only
as
the
means
of
acquiring
wealth
and
pleasure
desaix
loved
glory
for
itself
and
despised
every
other
consideration
to
him
riches
and
pleasure
were
of
no
value
nor
did
he
ever
give
them
a
moment
thought
he
was
a
little
man
about
an
inch
shorter
than
myself
always
badly
dressed
sometimes
even
ragged
and
despising
alike
comfort
and
convenience
enveloped
in
a
cloak
desaix
would
throw
himself
under
a
gun
and
sleep
as
contentedly
as
if
reposing
in
a
palace
luxury
had
for
him
no
charms
frank
and
honest
in
all
his
proceedings
he
was
denominated
by
the
arabs
sultan
the
just
nature
intended
him
to
figure
as
a
consummate
general
kleber
and
desaix
were
irreparable
losses
to
france
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
dismay
which
pervaded
the
camp
of
the
austrians
after
this
terrible
defeat
they
were
entirely
cut
from
all
retreat
and
were
at
the
mercy
of
napoleon
a
council
of
war
was
held
by
the
austrian
officers
during
the
night
and
it
was
unanimously
resolved
that
capitulation
was
unavoidable
early
the
next
morning
a
flag
of
truce
was
sent
to
the
of
napoleon
the
austrians
offered
to
abandon
italy
if
the
generosity
of
the
victor
would
grant
them
the
boon
of
not
being
made
prisoners
of
war
napoleon
met
the
envoy
with
great
courtesy
and
according
to
his
custom
stated
promptly
and
irrevocably
the
conditions
upon
which
he
was
willing
to
treat
the
terms
were
generous
the
austrian
armies
said
he
may
unmolested
return
to
their
homes
but
all
of
italy
must
be
abandoned
melas
who
was
eighty
years
of
age
hoped
to
modify
the
terms
and
again
sent
the
negotiator
to
suggest
some
alterations
monsieur
said
napoleon
my
conditions
are
irrevocable
i
did
not
begin
to
make
war
yesterday
your
position
is
as
perfectly
comprehended
by
me
as
by
yourselves
you
are
encumbered
with
dead
sick
and
wounded
destitute
of
provisions
deprived
of
the
elite
of
your
army
surrounded
on
every
side
i
might
exact
every
thing
but
i
respect
the
white
hairs
of
your
general
and
the
valor
of
your
soldiers
i
ask
nothing
but
what
is
rigorously
justified
by
the
present
position
of
affairs
take
what
steps
you
may
you
will
have
no
other
terms
the
conditions
were
immediately
signed
and
a
suspension
of
arms
was
agreed
upon
until
an
answer
could
be
received
from
vienna
napoleon
left
paris
for
this
campaign
on
the
of
may
the
battle
of
marengo
was
fought
on
the
of
june
thus
in
five
weeks
napoleon
has
scaled
the
barrier
of
the
alps
with
sixty
thousand
soldiers
most
of
them
undisciplined
recruits
he
had
utterly
discomfited
an
army
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
and
regained
the
whole
of
italy
the
bosom
of
every
frenchman
throbbed
with
gratitude
and
pride
one
wild
shout
of
enthusiasm
ascended
from
united
france
napoleon
had
laid
the
foundation
of
his
throne
deep
in
the
heart
of
the
french
nation
and
there
that
foundation
still
remains
unshaken
napoleon
now
entered
milan
in
triumph
he
remained
there
ten
days
busy
apparently
every
hour
by
day
and
by
night
in
the
political
condition
of
italy
the
serious
and
religious
tendencies
of
his
mind
are
developed
by
the
following
note
which
four
days
after
the
battle
of
marengo
he
wrote
to
the
consuls
in
paris
whatever
our
atheists
may
say
to
it
i
go
in
great
state
to
the
to
deum
which
is
to
be
chanted
in
the
cathedral
of
milan
the
te
deum
is
an
anthem
of
praise
sung
in
churches
on
occasion
of
thanksgiving
it
is
so
called
from
the
first
words
te
deum
laudamus
thee
god
we
praise
an
unworthy
spirit
of
detraction
has
vainly
sought
to
wrest
from
napoleon
the
honor
of
this
victory
and
to
attribute
it
all
to
the
flank
charge
made
by
kellerman
such
attempts
deserve
no
detail
reply
napoleon
had
secretly
and
suddenly
called
into
being
an
army
and
by
its
apparently
miraculous
creation
had
astounded
europe
he
had
effectually
deceived
the
vigilance
of
his
enemies
so
as
to
leave
them
entirely
in
the
dark
respecting
his
point
of
attack
he
had
conveyed
that
army
with
all
its
stores
over
the
pathless
crags
of
the
great
bernard
like
an
avalanche
he
had
descended
from
the
mountains
upon
the
plains
of
startled
italy
he
had
surrounded
the
austrian
hosts
though
they
were
doubled
his
numbers
with
a
net
through
which
they
could
not
break
in
a
decisive
battle
he
had
scattered
their
ranks
before
him
like
chaff
by
the
whirlwind
he
was
nobly
seconded
by
those
generals
whom
his
genius
had
chosen
and
created
it
is
indeed
true
that
without
his
generals
and
his
soldiers
he
could
not
have
gained
the
victory
massena
contributed
to
the
result
by
his
matchless
defense
of
genoa
moreau
by
holding
in
abeyance
the
army
of
the
rhine
lannes
by
his
iron
firmness
on
the
plain
of
montebello
desaix
by
the
promptness
with
which
he
rushed
to
the
rescue
as
soon
as
his
car
caught
the
thunders
of
the
cannon
of
marengo
and
kellerman
by
his
admirable
flank
charge
of
cavalry
but
it
was
the
genius
of
napoleon
which
planned
the
mighty
combination
which
roused
and
directed
the
enthusiasm
of
the
generals
which
inspired
the
soldiers
with
fearlessness
and
nerved
them
for
the
strife
and
which
through
these
efficient
agencies
secured
the
astounding
results
napoleon
established
his
triumphant
army
now
increased
to
eighty
thousand
men
in
the
rich
valley
of
the
po
he
assigned
to
the
heroic
massena
the
command
of
this
triumphant
host
and
ordering
all
the
forts
and
citadels
which
blocked
the
approaches
from
france
to
be
blown
up
set
out
on
the
of
june
for
his
return
to
paris
in
the
alps
by
the
pass
of
mt
cenis
he
met
the
carriage
of
madame
kellerman
who
was
going
to
italy
to
join
her
husband
napoleon
ordered
his
carriage
to
be
stopped
and
alighting
greeted
the
lady
with
great
courtesy
and
congratulated
her
upon
the
gallant
conduct
of
her
husband
at
marengo
as
he
was
riding
along
one
day
bourrienne
spoke
of
the
renown
which
the
first
consul
had
attained
yes
napoleon
thoughtfully
replied
a
few
more
events
like
this
campaign
and
my
name
may
perhaps
go
down
to
posterity
i
think
bourrienne
rejoined
that
you
have
already
done
enough
to
secure
a
long
and
lasting
fame
done
enough
napoleon
replied
you
are
very
good
it
is
true
that
in
less
than
two
years
i
have
conquered
cairo
paris
milan
but
were
i
to
die
half
a
page
of
general
history
would
be
all
that
would
be
devoted
to
my
exploits
napoleon
return
to
paris
through
the
provinces
of
france
was
a
scene
of
constant
triumph
the
joy
of
the
people
amounted
almost
to
frenzy
bonfires
illuminations
the
pealing
of
bells
and
the
thunders
of
artillery
accompanied
him
all
the
way
long
lines
of
young
maidens
selected
for
their
grace
and
beauty
formed
avenues
of
loveliness
and
smiles
through
which
he
was
to
pass
and
carpeted
his
path
with
flowers
he
arrived
in
paris
at
midnight
the
of
july
having
been
absent
but
eight
weeks
the
enthusiasm
of
the
parisians
was
unbounded
and
inexhaustible
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
the
festivities
continued
the
palace
of
the
tuileries
was
ever
thronged
with
a
crowd
eager
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
preserver
of
france
all
the
public
bodies
waited
upon
him
with
congratulations
bells
rung
cannon
thundered
bonfires
and
illuminations
blazed
rockets
and
in
meteoric
splendor
filled
the
air
bands
of
music
poured
forth
their
exuberant
strains
and
united
paris
thronging
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
and
flooding
back
into
the
elysian
fields
rent
the
heavens
with
deafening
shouts
of
exultation
as
napoleon
stood
at
the
window
of
his
palace
witnessing
this
spectacle
of
a
gratitude
he
said
the
sound
of
these
acclamations
is
as
sweet
to
me
as
the
voice
of
josephine
how
happy
i
am
to
be
beloved
by
such
a
people
preparations
were
immediately
made
for
a
brilliant
and
imposing
solemnity
in
commemoration
of
the
victory
let
no
triumphal
arch
be
raised
to
me
said
napoleon
i
wish
for
no
triumphal
arch
but
the
public
satisfaction
it
is
not
strange
that
enthusiasm
and
gratitude
should
have
glowed
in
the
ardent
bosoms
of
the
french
in
four
months
napoleon
had
raised
france
from
an
abyss
of
ruin
to
the
highest
pinnacle
of
prosperity
and
renown
for
anarchy
he
had
substituted
law
for
bankruptcy
a
treasury
for
ignominious
defeat
resplendent
victory
for
universal
discontent
as
universal
satisfaction
the
invaders
were
driven
from
france
the
hostile
alliance
broken
and
the
blessings
of
peace
were
now
promised
to
the
nation
during
this
campaign
there
was
presented
a
very
interesting
illustration
of
napoleon
wonderful
power
of
anticipating
the
progress
of
coming
events
bourrienne
one
day
just
before
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
entered
the
cabinet
at
the
tuileries
and
found
an
immense
map
of
italy
unrolled
upon
the
carpet
and
napoleon
stretched
upon
it
with
pins
whose
heads
were
tipped
with
red
and
black
to
represent
the
french
and
austrian
forces
napoleon
was
studying
all
the
possible
combinations
and
evolutions
of
the
two
hostile
armies
bourrienne
in
silence
but
with
deep
interest
watched
the
progress
of
this
pin
campaign
napoleon
having
arranged
the
pins
with
red
heads
where
he
intended
to
conduct
the
french
troops
and
with
the
black
pins
designating
the
point
which
he
supposed
the
austrians
would
occupy
looked
up
to
his
secretary
and
said
do
you
think
that
i
shall
beat
melas
why
how
can
i
tell
bourrienne
answered
why
you
simpleton
said
napoleon
playfully
just
look
here
melas
is
at
alexandria
where
he
has
his
he
will
remain
there
until
genoa
surrenders
he
has
in
alexandria
his
magazines
his
hospitals
his
artillery
his
reserves
passing
the
alps
here
sticking
a
pin
into
the
great
bernard
i
fall
upon
melas
in
his
rear
i
cut
off
his
communications
with
austria
i
meet
him
here
in
the
valley
of
the
bormida
so
saying
he
stuck
a
red
pin
into
the
plain
of
marengo
bourrienne
regarded
this
maneuvering
of
pins
as
mere
pastime
his
countenance
expressed
his
perfect
incredulity
napoleon
perceiving
this
addressed
to
him
some
of
his
usual
apostrophes
in
which
he
was
accustomed
playfully
to
indulge
in
moments
of
relaxation
such
as
you
ninny
you
goose
and
rolled
up
the
map
ten
weeks
passed
away
and
bourrienne
found
himself
upon
the
banks
of
the
bormida
writing
at
napoleon
dictation
an
account
of
the
battle
of
marengo
astonished
to
find
napoleon
anticipations
thus
minutely
fulfilled
he
frankly
avowed
his
admiration
of
the
military
sagacity
thus
displayed
napoleon
himself
smiled
at
the
justice
of
his
foresight
two
days
before
the
news
of
the
battle
of
marengo
arrived
in
vienna
england
effected
a
new
treaty
with
austria
for
the
more
vigorous
prosecution
of
the
war
by
this
convention
it
was
provided
that
england
should
loan
austria
ten
millions
of
dollars
to
bear
no
interest
during
the
continuance
of
the
conflict
and
the
austrian
cabinet
bound
itself
not
to
make
peace
with
france
without
the
consent
of
the
court
of
james
the
emperor
of
austria
was
now
sadly
embarrassed
his
sense
of
honor
would
not
allow
him
to
violate
his
pledge
to
the
king
of
england
and
to
make
peace
on
the
other
hand
he
trembled
at
the
thought
of
seeing
the
armies
of
the
invincible
napoleon
again
marching
upon
his
capital
he
therefore
resolved
to
temporize
and
in
order
to
gain
time
sent
an
embassador
to
paris
the
plenipotentiary
presented
to
napoleon
a
letter
in
which
the
emperor
stated
you
will
give
credit
to
every
thing
which
count
julien
shall
say
on
my
part
i
will
ratify
whatever
he
shall
do
napoleon
prompt
in
action
and
uniformed
of
the
new
treaty
between
ferdinand
and
george
immediately
caused
the
preliminaries
of
peace
to
be
drawn
up
which
were
signed
by
the
french
and
austrian
ministers
the
cabinet
in
vienna
angry
with
their
embassador
for
not
protracting
the
discussion
refused
to
ratify
the
treaty
recalled
count
julien
sent
him
into
exile
informed
the
first
consul
of
the
treat
which
bound
austria
not
to
make
peace
without
the
concurrence
of
great
britain
assured
france
of
the
readiness
of
the
english
cabinet
to
enter
into
negotiations
and
urged
the
immediate
opening
of
a
congress
at
luneville
to
which
plenipotentiaries
should
be
sent
from
each
of
the
three
great
contending
powers
napoleon
was
highly
indignant
in
view
of
this
duplicity
and
perfidy
yet
controlling
his
anger
he
consented
to
treat
with
england
and
with
that
view
proposed
a
naval
armistice
with
the
mistress
of
the
seas
to
this
proposition
england
peremptorily
refused
to
accede
as
it
would
enable
france
to
throw
supplies
into
egypt
and
malta
which
island
england
was
besieging
the
naval
armistice
would
have
been
undeniably
for
the
interests
of
france
but
the
continental
armistice
was
as
undeniably
adverse
to
her
interests
enabling
austria
to
recover
from
her
defeats
and
to
strengthen
her
armies
napoleon
fully
convinced
that
england
in
he
r
inaccessible
position
did
not
wish
for
peace
and
that
her
only
object
in
endeavoring
to

that
she
might
throw
obstacles
in
the
way
of
reconciliation
with
austria
offered
to
renounce
all
armistice
with
england
and
to
treat
with
her
separately
this
england
also
refused
it
was
now
september
two
months
had
passed
in
these
vexations
and
sterile
negotiations
napoleon
had
taken
every
step
in
his
power
to
secure
peace
he
sincerely
desired
it
he
had
already
won
all
the
laurels
he
could
wish
to
win
on
the
field
of
battle
the
reconstruction
of
society
in
france
and
the
consolidation
of
his
power
demanded
all
his
energies
the
consolidation
of
his
power
that
was
just
what
the
government
of
england
dreaded
the
consolidation
of
democratic
power
in
france
was
dangerous
to
king
and
to
noble
william
pits
the
soul
of
the
aristocratic
government
of
england
determined
still
to
prosecute
the
war
france
could
not
harm
england
but
england
with
her
invincible
fleet
could
sweep
the
commerce
of
france
from
the
seas
fox
and
his
coadjutors
with
great
eloquence
and
energy
opposed
the
war
their
efforts
were
however
unavailing
the
people
of
england
notwithstanding
all
the
efforts
of
the
government
to
defame
the
character
of
the
first
consul
still
cherished
the
conviction
that
after
all
napoleon
was
their
friend
napoleon
in
subsequent
years
while
reviewing
these
scenes
of
his
early
conflicts
with
characteristic
eloquence
and
magnanimity
gave
utterance
to
the
following
sentiments
which
it
is
as
certain
as
destiny
that
the
verdict
of
the
world
will
yet
confirm
pitt
was
the
master
of
european
policy
he
held
in
his
hands
the
moral
fate
of
nations
but
he
made
an
ill
use
of
his
power
he
kindled
the
fire
of
discord
throughout
the
universe
and
his
name
like
that
of
erostratus
will
be
inscribed
in
history
amidst
flames
lamentations
and
tears
years
of
universal
conflagration
the
numerous
coalitions
that
added
fuel
to
the
flame
the
revolution
and
devastation
of
europe
the
bloodshed
of
nations
the
frightful
debt
of
england
by
which
all
these
horrors
were
maintained
the
pestilential
system
of
loans
by
which
the
people
of
europe
are
oppressed
the
general
discontent
that
now
prevails
all
must
be
attributed
to
pitt
posterity
will
brand
him
as
a
scourge
the
man
so
lauded
in
his
own
time
will
hereafter
be
regarded
as
the
genius
of
evil
not
that
i
consider
him
to
have
been
willfully
atrocious
or
doubt
his
having
entertained
the
conviction
that
he
was
acting
right
but
bartholomew
had
also
its
conscientious
advocates
the
pope
and
cardinals
celebrated
it
by
a
te
deum
and
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
their
having
done
so
in
perfect
sincerity
such
is
the
weakness
of
human
reason
and
judgment
but
that
for
which
posterity
will
above
all
execrate
the
memory
of
pitt
is
the
hateful
school
which
he
has
left
behind
him
its
insolent
machiavelism
its
profound
immorality
its
cold
egotism
and
its
utter
disregard
of
justice
and
human
happiness
whether
it
be
the
effect
of
admiration
and
gratitude
or
the
result
of
mere
instinct
and
sympathy
pitt
is
and
will
continue
to
be
the
idol
of
the
european
aristocracy
there
was
indeed
a
touch
of
the
sylla
in
his
character
his
system
has
kept
the
popular
cause
in
check
and
brought
about
the
triumph
of
the
patricians
as
for
fox
one
must
not
look
for
his
model
among
the
ancients
he
is
himself
a
model
and
his
principles
will
sooner
or
later
rule
the
world
the
death
of
fox
was
one
of
the
fatalities
of
my
career
had
his
life
been
prolonged
affairs
would
taken
a
totally
different
turn
the
cause
of
the
people
would
have
triumphed
and
we
should
have
established
a
new
order
of
things
in
europe
austria
really
desired
peace
the
march
of
napoleon
armies
upon
vienna
was
an
evil
more
to
be
dreaded
than
even
the
consolidation
of
napoleon
power
in
france
but
austria
was
by
loans
and
treaties
so
entangled
with
england
that
she
could
make
not
peace
without
the
consent
of
the
court
of
james
napoleon
found
that
he
was
but
triffled
with
interminable
difficulties
were
thrown
in
the
way
of
negotiation
austria
was
taking
advantage
of
the
cessation
of
hostilities
merely
to
recruit
her
defeated
armies
that
soon
as
the
approaching
winter
had
passed
away
she
might
fall
with
renovated
energies
upon
france
the
month
of
november
had
now
arrived
and
the
mountains
whitened
with
snow
were
swept
by
the
bleak
winds
of
winter
the
period
of
the
armistice
had
expired
austria
applied
for
its
prolongation
napoleon
was
no
longer
thus
to
be
duped
he
consented
however
to
a
continued
suspension
of
hostilities
on
condition
that
the
treaty
of
peace
were
signed
within
hours
austria
believing
that
no
sane
man
would
march
an
army
into
germany
in
the
dead
of
winter
and
that
she
should
have
abundant
time
to
prepare
for
a
spring
campaign
refused
the
armies
of
france
were
immediately
on
the
move
the
emperor
of
austria
had
improved
every
moment
of
this
transient
interval
of
peace
in
recruiting
his
forces
in
person
he
had
visited
the
army
to
inspire
his
troops
with
enthusiasm
the
command
of
the
imperial
forces
was
intrusted
to
his
second
brother
the
archduke
john
napoleon
moved
with
his
accustomed
vigor
the
political
necessities
of
paris
and
of
france
rendered
it
impossible
for
him
to
leave
the
metropolis
he
ordered
one
powerful
army
under
general
brune
to
attack
the
austrians
in
italy
on
the
banks
of
mincio
and
to
press
firmly
toward
vienna
in
the
performance
of
this
operation
general
macdonald
in
the
dead
of
winter
effected
his
heroic
passage
over
the
alps
by
the
pass
of
the
splugen
victory
followed
their
standards
moreau
with
his
magnificent
army
commenced
a
winter
campaign
on
the
rhine
between
the
rivers
iser
and
inn
there
is
an
enormous
forest
many
leagues
in
extent
of
sombre
firs
and
pines
it
is
a
dreary
and
almost
uninhabited
wilderness
of
wild
ravines
and
tangled
two
great
roads
have
been
cut
through
the
forest
and
sundry
woodmen
paths
penetrate
it
at
different
points
in
the
centre
there
is
a
little
hamlet
of
a
few
miserable
huts
called
hohenlinden
in
this
forest
on
the
night
of
the
of
december
moreau
with
sixty
thousand
men
encountered
the
archduke
john
with
seventy
thousand
austrian
troops
the
clocks
upon
the
towers
of
munich
had
but
just
tolled
the
hour
of
midnight
when
both
armies
were
in
motion
each
hoping
to
surprise
the
other
a
dismal
wintry
storm
was
howling
over
the
tree
tops
and
the
smothering
snow
falling
rapidly
obliterated
all
traces
of
a
path
and
rendered
it
almost
impossible
to
drag
through
the
drifts
the
ponderous
artillery
both
parties
in
the
dark
and
tempestuous
night
became
entangled
in
the
forest
and
the
heads
of
their
columns
in
various
places
met
an
awful
scene
of
confusion
conflict
and
carnage
then
ensued
imagination
can
not
compass
the
terrible
sublimity
of
that
spectacle
the
dark
midnight
the
howlings
of
the
wintry
storm
the
driving
sheets
of
snow
the
incessant
roar
of
artillery
and
of
musketry
from
one
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
combatants
the
lightning
flashes
of
the
guns
the
crash
of
the
falling
trees
as
the
heavy
swept
through
the
forest
the
floundering
of
innumerable
horsemen
bewildered
in
the
pathless
snow
the
shout
of
onset
the
shriek
of
death
and
the
burst
of
martial
music
from
a
thousand
bands
all
combined
to
present
a
scene
of
horror
and
of
demoniac
energy
which
probably
even
this
lost
world
never
presented
before
the
darkness
of
the
black
forest
was
so
intense
and
the
snow
fell
in
flakes
so
thick
and
fast
and
blinding
that
the
combatants
could
with
difficulty
see
each
other
they
often
judged
of
the
foe
only
by
his
position
and
fired
at
the
flashes
gleaming
through
the
gloom
at
times
hostile
divisions
became
intermingled
in
inextricable
confusion
and
hand
to
hand
bayonet
crossing
bayonet
and
sword
clashing
against
sword
they
fought
with
the
ferocity
of
demons
for
though
the
officers
of
an
army
may
be
influenced
by
the
most
elevated
sentiments
of
dignity
and
of
honor
the
mass
of
the
common
soldiers
have
ever
been
the
most
miserable
worthless
and
degraded
of
mankind
as
the
advancing
and
retreating
host
wavered
to
and
fro
the
wounded
by
thousands
were
left
on
and
in
dark
ravines
with
the
drifting
snow
crimsoned
with
blood
their
only
blanket
there
in
solitude
and
agony
to
moan
and
freeze
and
die
what
the
eye
of
god
must
have
witnessed
that
night
in
the
solitudes
of
that
dark
and
forest
at
last
the
morning
dawned
through
the
unbroken
clouds
and
the
battle
raged
with
renovated
fury
nearly
twenty
thousand
mutilated
bodies
of
the
dead
and
wounded
were
left
upon
the
field
with
gory
locks
frozen
to
their
icy
pillows
and
covered
with
mounds
of
snow
at
last
the
french
were
victorious
at
every
point
the
austrians
having
lost
thousand
men
in
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
one
hundred
pieces
of
artillery
and
an
immense
number
of
wagons
fled
in
dismay
this
terrific
conflict
has
been
immortalized
by
the
noble
epic
of
campbell
which
is
now
familiar
wherever
the
english
language
is
known
on
linden
when
the
sun
was
low
all
bloodless
lay
the
untrodden
snow
and
dark
as
winter
was
the
flow
or
iser
rolling
rapidly
but
linden
saw
another
sight
when
the
drums
beat
at
dead
of
night
commanding
fires
of
death
to
light
the
darkness
of
her
scenery
the
retreating
austrians
rushed
down
the
valley
of
the
danube
moreau
followed
thundering
at
their
heels
plunging
balls
and
shells
into
their
retreating
ranks
the
victorious
french
were
within
thirty
miles
of
vienna
and
the
capital
was
in
a
state
of
indescribable
dismay
the
emperor
again
sent
imploring
an
armistice
the
application
was
promptly
acceded
to
for
napoleon
was
contending
only
for
peace
yet
with
unexempled
magnanimity
notwithstanding
these
astonishing
victories
napoleon
made
no
essential
alterations
in
his
terms
austria
was
at
his
feet
his
conquering
armies
were
almost
in
sight
of
the
steeples
of
vienna
there
was
no
power
which
the
emperor
could
present
to
obstruct
their
resistless
march
he
might
have
exacted
any
terms
of
humiliation
but
still
he
adhered
to
the
first
terms
which
he
had
proposed
moreau
was
urged
by
some
of
his
officers
to
press
on
to
vienna
we
had
better
halt
he
replied
and
be
content
with
peace
it
is
for
that
alone
that
we
are
fighting
the
emperor
of
austria
was
thus
compelled
to
treat
without
the
concurrence
of
england
the
insurmountable
obstacle
in
the
way
of
peace
was
thus
removed
at
luneville
joseph
bonaparte
appeared
as
the
embassador
of
napoleon
and
count
cobentzel
as
the
plenipotentiary
of
austria
the
terms
of
the
treaty
were
soon
settled
and
france
was
again
at
peace
with
all
the
world
england
alone
excepted
by
this
treaty
the
rhine
was
acknowledged
as
the
boundary
of
france
the
adige
limited
the
possessions
of
austria
in
italy
and
napoleon
made
it
an
essential
article
that
every
italian
imprisoned
in
the
dungeons
of
austria
for
political
offences
should
immediately
be
liberated
there
was
to
be
no
interference
by
either
with
the
new
republics
which
had
sprung
up
in
italy
they
were
to
be
permitted
to
choose
whatever
form
of
government
they
preferred
in
reference
to
this
treaty
sir
walter
scott
makes
the
candid
admission
that
the
treaty
of
luneville
was
not
much
more
advantageous
to
france
than
that
of
campo
formio
the
moderation
of
the
first
consul
indicated
at
once
his
desire
for
peace
upon
the
continent
and
considerable
respect
for
the
bravery
and
strength
of
austria
and
alison
in
cautious
but
significant
phrase
remarks
these
conditions
did
not
differ
materially
from
those
offered
by
napoleon
before
the
renewal
of
the
war
a
remarkable
circumstance
when
it
is
remembered
how
vast
and
addition
the
victories
of
marengo
hohenlinden
and
the
mincio
had
since
made
to
the
preponderance
of
the
french
armies
it
was
indeed
a
remarkable
circumstance
that
napoleon
should
have
manifested
such
unparalleled
moderation
under
circumstances
of
such
aggravated
indignity
in
napoleon
first
italian
campaign
he
was
contending
solely
for
peace
at
last
he
attained
it
in
the
treaty
of
campo
formio
on
terms
equally
honorable
to
austria
and
to
france
on
his
return
from
egypt
he
found
the
armies
of
austria
three
hundred
thousand
strong
in
alliance
with
england
invading
the
territories
of
the
republic
he
implored
peace
in
the
name
of
bleeding
humanity
upon
the
fair
basis
of
the
treaty
of
campo
formio
his
foes
regarded
his
supplication
as
the
imploring
cry
of
weakness
and
treated
it
with
scorn
with
new
vigor
they
poured
their
tempests
of
balls
and
shells
upon
france
napoleon
sealed
the
alps
and
dispersed
his
foes
at
marengo
like
autumn
leaves
before
the
alps
and
dispersed
his
foes
at
marengo
like
autumn
leaves
before
the
gale
amid
the
smoke
and
the
blood
and
the
groans
of
the
field
of
his
victory
he
again
wrote
imploring
peace
and
he
wrote
in
terms
dictated
by
the
honest
and
gushing
sympathies
of
a
humane
man
and
not
in
the
cold
and
stately
forms
of
the
diplomatist
crushed
as
his
foes
were
he
rose
not
in
his
demands
but
nobly
said
i
am
still
willing
to
make
peace
upon
the
fair
basis
of
the
treaty
of
campo
formio
his
treacherous
foes
to
gain
time
to
recruit
their
armies
that
they
might
fall
upon
him
with
renovated
vigor
agreed
to
an
armistice
they
then
threw
all
possible
embarrassments
in
the
way
of
negotiation
and
prolonged
the
armistice
till
the
winds
of
winter
were
sweeping
fiercely
over
the
hills
of
austria
they
thought
that
it
was
then
too
late
for
napoleon
to
make
any
movements
until
spring
and
that
they
had
a
long
winter
before
them
in
which
to
prepare
for
another
campaign
they
refused
peace
through
storms
and
freezing
gales
and
drifting
snows
the
armies
of
napoleon
marched
painfully
to
hohenlinden
the
hosts
of
austria
were
again
routed
and
were
swept
away
as
the
drifted
snow
flies
before
the
gale
ten
thousand
frenchmen
lie
cold
in
death
the
terrible
price
of
the
victory
the
emperor
of
austria
in
his
palaces
heard
the
thunderings
of
napoleon
approaching
artillery
he
implored
peace
it
is
all
that
i
desire
said
napoleon
i
am
not
fighting
for
ambition
or
for
conquest
i
am
still
ready
to
make
peace
upon
the
fair
basis
of
the
treaty
of
campo
formio
while
all
the
continent
was
now
at
peace
with
france
england
alone
with
indomitable
resolution
continued
the
war
without
allies
and
without
any
apparent
or
avowed
object
france
comparatively
powerless
upon
the
seas
could
strike
no
blows
which
would
be
felt
by
the
distant
islanders
on
every
point
says
sir
walter
scott
the
english
squadrons
annihilated
the
commerce
of
france
crippled
her
revenues
and
blockaded
her
forts
the
treaty
of
luneville
was
signed
the
of
february
napoleon
lamenting
the
continued
hostility
of
england
in
announcing
this
peace
to
the
people
of
france
remarked
why
is
not
this
treaty
the
treaty
of
a
general
peace
this
was
the
wish
of
france
this
has
been
the
constant
object
of
the
efforts
of
her
government
but
its
desires
are
fruitless
all
europe
knows
that
the
british
minister
has
endeavored
to
frustrate
the
negotiations
at
luneville
in
vain
was
it
declared
to
him
that
france
was
ready
to
enter
into
a
separate
negotiation
this
declaration
only
produced
a
refusal
under
the
pretext
that
england
could
not
abandon
her
ally
since
then
when
that
ally
consented
to
treat
without
england
that
government
sought
other
means
to
delay
a
peace
so
necessary
to
the
world
it
raises
pretensions
contrary
to
the
dignity
and
rights
of
all
nations
the
whole
commerce
of
asia
and
of
immense
colonies
does
not
satisfy
its
ambition
all
the
seas
must
submit
to
the
exclusive
sovereignty
of
england
as
william
pitt
received
the
tidings
of
this
discomfiture
of
his
allies
in
despairing
despondency
he
exclaimed
fold
up
the
map
of
europe
in
need
not
again
be
opened
for
twenty
years
while
these
great
affairs
were
in
progress
napoleon
in
paris
was
consecrating
his
energies
with
almost
miraculous
power
in
developing
all
the
resources
of
the
majestic
empire
under
his
control
he
possessed
the
power
of
abstraction
to
a
degree
which
has
probably
never
been
equaled
he
could
concentrate
all
his
attention
for
any
length
of
time
upon
one
subject
and
then
laying
that
aside
entirely
without
expending
any
energies
in
unavailing
anxiety
could
turn
to
another
with
all
the
freshness
and
the
vigor
of
an
unpreoccupied
mind
incessant
mental
labor
was
the
luxury
of
his
life
occupation
said
he
is
my
element
i
am
born
and
made
for
it
i
have
found
the
limits
beyond
which
i
could
not
use
my
legs
i
have
seen
the
extent
to
which
i
could
use
my
eyes
but
i
have
never
known
any
bounds
to
my
capacity
for
application
the
universality
of
napoleon
genius
was
now
most
conspicuous
the
revenues
of
the
nation
were
replenished
and
all
the
taxes
arranged
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
people
the
bank
of
france
was
reorganized
and
new
energy
infused
into
its
operations
several
millions
of
dollars
were
expended
in
constructing
and
perfecting
five
magnificent
roads
radiating
from
paris
to
the
frontiers
of
the
empire
robbers
the
vagabonds
of
disbanded
armies
infested
the
roads
rendering
traveling
dangerous
in
the
extreme
be
patient
said
napoleon
give
me
a
month
or
two
i
must
first
conquer
peace
abroad
i
will
then
do
speedy
and
complete
justice
upon
these
highwaymen
a
very
important
canal
connecting
belgium
with
france
had
been
commenced
some
years
before
the
engineers
could
not
agree
respecting
the
best
direction
of
the
cutting
through
the
highlands
which
separated
the
valley
of
the
oise
from
that
of
the
somme
he
visited
the
spot
in
person
decided
the
question
promptly
and
decided
it
wisely
and
the
canal
was
pressed
to
its
completion
he
immediately
caused
three
new
bridges
to
be
thrown
across
the
seine
at
paris
he
commenced
the
magnificent
road
of
the
simplon
crossing
the
rugged
alps
with
a
broad
and
smooth
highway
which
for
ages
will
remain
a
durable
monument
of
the
genius
and
energy
of
napoleon
in
gratitude
for
the
favors
he
had
received
from
the
monks
of
the
great
bernard
he
founded
two
similar
establishments
for
the
aid
of
travelers
one
on
mount
cenis
the
other
on
the
simplon
and
both
auxiliary
to
the
convent
on
the
great
bernard
concurrently
with
these
majestic
undertakings
he
commenced
the
compilation
of
the
civil
code
of
france
the
ablest
lawyers
of
europe
were
summoned
to
this
enterprise
and
the
whole
work
was
discussed
section
by
section
in
the
council
of
state
over
which
napoleon
presided
the
lawyers
were
amazed
to
find
that
the
first
consul
was
as
perfectly
familiar
with
all
the
details
of
legal
and
political
science
as
he
was
with
military
strategy
bourrienne
mentions
that
one
day
a
letter
was
received
from
an
emigrant
general
durosel
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
island
of
jersey
the
following
is
an
extract
from
the
letter
you
can
not
have
forgotten
general
that
when
your
late
father
was
obliged
to
take
your
brothers
from
the
college
of
autun
he
was
unprovided
with
money
and
asked
of
me
one
hundred
and
dollars
which
i
lent
him
with
pleasure
after
his
return
he
had
not
an
opportunity
of
paying
me
and
when
i
left
ajaccio
your
mother
offered
to
dispose
of
some
plate
in
order
to
pay
the
debt
to
this
i
objected
and
told
her
that
i
would
wait
until
she
could
pay
me
at
her
convenience
previous
to
the
revolution
i
believe
that
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
fulfill
her
wish
of
discharging
the
debt
i
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
trouble
you
about
such
a
trifle
but
such
is
my
unfortunate
situation
that
even
this
trifle
is
of
some
importance
to
me
at
the
age
of
general
after
having
served
my
country
for
sixty
years
i
am
compelled
to
take
refuge
here
and
to
subsist
on
a
scanty
allowance
granted
by
the
english
government
to
french
emigrants
i
say
emigrants
for
i
am
obliged
to
be
one
against
my
will
upon
hearing
this
letter
read
napoleon
immediately
and
warmly
said
bourrienne
this
is
sacred
do
not
lose
a
moment
send
the
old
man
ten
times
the
sum
write
to
general
durosel
that
he
shall
immediately
be
erased
from
the
list
of
emigrants
what
mischief
those
brigands
of
the
convention
have
done
i
can
never
repair
it
all
napoleon
uttered
these
words
with
a
degree
of
emotion
which
he
had
rarely
before
evinced
in
the
evening
he
inquired
with
much
interest
of
bourrienne
if
he
had
executed
his
orders
many
attempts
were
made
at
this
time
to
assassinate
the
first
consul
though
france
with
the
most
unparalleled
unanimity
surrounded
him
with
admiration
gratitude
and
homage
there
were
violent
men
in
the
two
extremes
of
society
among
the
jacobins
and
the
inexorable
royalists
who
regarded
him
as
in
their
way
napoleon
escape
from
the
explosion
of
the
infernal
machine
got
up
by
the
royalists
was
almost
miraculous
on
the
evening
of
the
of
december
napoleon
was
going
to
the
opera
to
hear
haydn
oratorio
of
the
creation
which
was
to
be
performed
for
the
first
time
intensely
occupied
by
business
he
was
reluctant
to
go
but
to
gratify
josephine
yielded
to
her
urgent
request
it
was
necessary
for
his
carriage
to
pass
through
a
narrow
street
a
cart
apparently
by
accident
overturned
obstructed
the
passage
a
barrel
suspended
beneath
the
cart
contained
as
deadly
a
machine
as
could
be
constructed
with
and
all
the
missiles
of
death
the
coachman
succeeded
in
forcing
his
way
by
the
cart
he
had
barely
passed
when
an
explosion
took
place
which
was
all
over
paris
and
which
seemed
to
shake
the
city
to
its
foundations
eight
persons
were
instantly
killed
and
more
than
sixty
were
wounded
of
whom
about
twenty
subsequently
died
the
houses
for
a
long
distance
on
each
side
of
the
street
were
fearfully
shattered
and
many
of
them
were
nearly
blown
to
pieces
the
carriage
rocked
as
upon
the
billows
of
the
sea
and
the
windows
were
shattered
to
fragments
napoleon
had
been
in
too
many
scenes
of
terror
to
be
alarmed
by
any
noise
or
destruction
which
gunpowder
could
produce
ha
said
he
with
perfect
composure
we
are
blown
up
one
of
his
companions
in
the
carriage
greatly
terrified
thrust
his
head
through
the
demolished
window
and
called
loudly
to
the
driver
to
stop
no
no
said
napoleon
drive
on
when
the
first
consul
entered
the
opera
house
he
appeared
perfectly
calm
and
unmoved
the
greatest
consternation
however
prevailed
in
all
parts
of
the
house
for
the
explosion
had
been
heard
and
the
most
fearful
apprehensions
were
felt
for
the
safety
of
the
idolized
napoleon
as
soon
as
he
appeared
thunders
of
applause
which
shook
the
very
walls
of
the
theatre
gave
affecting
testimony
of
the
attachment
of
the
people
to
his
person
in
a
few
moments
josephine
who
had
come
in
her
private
carriage
entered
the
box
napoleon
turned
to
her
with
perfect
tranquillity
and
said
the
rascals
tried
to
blow
me
up
where
is
the
book
of
the
oratorio
napoleon
soon
left
the
opera
and
returned
to
the
tuileries
he
found
a
vast
crowd
assembled
there
attracted
by
affection
for
his
person
and
anxiety
for
his
safety
the
atrocity
of
this
attempt
excited
universal
horror
and
only
increased
the
already
almost
boundless
popularity
of
the
first
consul
deputations
and
addresses
were
immediately
poured
in
upon
him
from
paris
and
from
all
the
departments
of
france
congratulating
him
upon
his
escape
it
was
at
first
thought
that
this
conspiracy
was
the
work
of
the
jacobins
there
were
in
paris
more
than
a
hundred
of
the
leaders
of
the
execrable
party
who
had
obtained
a
sanguinary
notoriety
during
the
reign
of
terror
they
were
active
members
of
a
jacolin
club
a
violent
and
vulgar
gathering
continually
plotting
the
overthrow
of
the
government
and
the
assassination
of
the
first
consul
they
were
thoroughly
detested
by
the
people
and
the
community
was
glad
to
avail
itself
of
any
plausible
pretext
for
banishing
them
from
france
without
sufficient
evidence
that
they
were
actually
guilty
of
this
particular
outrage
in
the
strong
excitement
and
indignation
of
the
moment
a
decree
was
passed
by
the
legislative
bodies
sending
one
hundred
and
sixty
of
these
bloodstained
culprits
into
exile
the
wish
was
earnestly
expressed
that
napoleon
would
promptly
punish
them
by
his
own
dictatorial
power
napoleon
had
in
fact
acquired
such
unbounded
popularity
and
the
nation
was
so
thoroughly
impressed
with
a
sense
of
his
justice
and
his
wisdom
the
whatever
he
said
was
done
he
however
insisted
that
the
business
should
be
conducted
by
the
constituted
tribunals
and
under
the
regular
forms
of
law
the
responsibility
of
this
measure
said
napoleon
must
rest
with
the
legislative
body
the
consuls
are
irresponsible
but
the
ministers
are
not
any
one
of
them
who
should
sign
an
arbitrary
decree
might
hereafter
be
called
to
account
not
a
single
individual
must
be
compromised
the
consuls
themselves
know
not
what
may
happen
as
for
me
while
i
live
i
am
not
afraid
that
any
one
will
be
killed
and
then
i
can
not
answer
for
the
safety
of
my
two
colleagues
it
would
be
your
turn
to
govern
said
he
smiling
and
turning
to
cambaceres
and
you
are
not
as
yet
very
firm
in
the
stirrups
it
will
be
better
to
have
a
law
for
the
present
as
well
as
for
the
future
it
was
finally
after
much
deliberation
decided
that
the
council
of
state
should
draw
up
a
declaration
of
the
reasons
for
the
act
the
first
consul
was
to
sign
the
decree
and
the
senate
was
to
declare
whether
it
was
or
was
not
constitutional
thus
cautiously
napoleon
proceed
under
circumstances
so
exciting
the
law
however
was
unjust
and
tyrannical
guilty
as
these
men
were
of
other
crimes
by
which
they
had
forfeited
all
sympathy
it
subsequently
appeared
that
they
were
not
guilty
of
this
crime
napoleon
was
evidently
embraced
by
this
uncertainty
of
their
guilty
and
was
not
willing
that
they
should
be
denounced
as
contrivers
of
the
infernal
machine
we
believe
said
he
that
they
are
guilty
but
we
do
not
know
it
they
must
be
transported
for
the
crimes
which
they
have
committed
the
massacres
and
the
conspiracies
already
proved
against
them
the
decree
was
passed
but
napoleon
strong
in
popularity
became
so
convinced
of
the
powerlessness
and
insignificance
of
these
jacobins
that
the
decree
was
never
enforced
against
them
they
remained
in
france
but
they
were
conscious
that
the
eye
of
the
police
was
upon
them
it
is
not
my
own
person
said
napoleon
that
i
seek
to
avenge
my
fortune
which
has
preserved
me
so
often
on
the
field
of
battle
will
continue
to
preserve
me
i
think
not
of
myself
i
think
of
social
order
which
it
is
my
mission
to
and
of
the
national
honor
which
it
is
my
duty
to
purge
from
an
abominable
stain
to
the
innumerable
addresses
of
congratulation
and
attachment
which
this
occurrence
elicited
napoleon
replied
i
have
been
touched
by
the
proofs
of
affection
which
the
people
of
paris
have
shown
me
on
this
occasion
i
deserve
them
for
the
only
aim
of
my
thoughts
and
of
my
actions
is
to
augment
the
prosperity
and
the
glory
of
france
while
those
banditti
confined
themselves
to
direct
attacks
upon
me
i
could
leave
to
the
laws
the
task
of
punishing
them
but
since
they
have
endangered
the
population
of
the
capital
by
a
crime
unexampled
in
history
the
punishment
must
be
equally
speedy
and
terrible
it
was
soon
proved
much
to
the
surprise
of
napoleon
that
the
atrocious
act
was
perpetrated
by
the
partisans
of
the
bourbons
many
of
the
most
prominent
of
the
loyalists
were
implicated
in
this
horrible
conspiracy
napoleon
felt
that
he
deserved
their
gratitude
he
had
interposed
to
save
them
from
the
fury
of
the
jacobins
against
the
remonstrances
of
his
friends
he
had
passed
a
decree
which
restored
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
of
these
wandering
emigrants
to
france
he
had
done
every
thing
in
his
power
to
enable
them
to
regain
their
confiscated
estates
he
had
been
in
all
respects
their
friend
and
benefactor
and
he
would
not
believe
until
the
proof
was
indisputable
that
they
could
thus
requite
him
the
wily
fouche
however
dragged
the
whole
matter
into
light
the
prominent
conspirators
were
arrested
and
shot
the
following
letter
written
on
this
occasion
by
josephine
to
the
minister
of
police
strikingly
illustrates
the
benevolence
of
her
heart
and
exhibits
in
a
very
honorable
light
the
character
of
napoleon
while
i
yet
tremble
at
the
frightful
event
which
has
just
occurred
i
am
distressed
through
fear
of
the
punishment
to
be
inflicted
on
the
guilty
who
belong
it
is
said
to
families
with
whom
i
once
lived
in
habits
of
intercourse
i
shall
be
solicited
by
mothers
sisters
and
disconsolate
wives
and
my
heart
will
be
broken
through
my
inability
to
obtain
all
the
mercy
for
which
i
would
plead
i
know
that
the
elemency
of
the
first
who
belong
it
is
said
to
families
with
whom
i
once
lived
in
habits
of

shall
be

and

wives
and
my
heart
will
be
broken
through
my
inability
to
obtain
all
the
mercy
for
which
i
would
plead
i
know
that
the
elemency
of
the
first
consul
is
great
his
attachment
to
me
extreme
the
chief
of
the
government
has
not
been
alone
exposed
and
it
is
that
which
will
render
him
severe
inflexible
i
conjure
you
therefore
to
do
all
in
your
power
to
prevent
inquiries
being
pushed
too
far
do
not
detect
all
those
persons
who
have
been
accomplices
in
this
odious
transaction
let
not
france
so
long
overwhelmed
in
consternation
by
public
executions
groan
anew
beneath
such
inflictions
when
the
ringleaders
of
this
nefarious
attempt
shall
have
been
secured
let
severity
give
place
to
pity
for
inferior
agents
seduced
as
they
may
have
been
by
dangerous
falsehoods
or
exaggerated
opinions
as
a
woman
a
wife
and
a
mother
i
must
feel
the
heartrendings
of
those
will
apply
to
me
act
citizen
minister
in
such
a
way
that
the
number
of
these
may
be
lessened
it
seems
almost
miraculous
that
napoleon
should
have
escaped
the
innumerable
conspiracies
which
at
this
time
were
formed
against
him
the
partisans
of
the
bourbons
though
that
if
napoleon
could
be
removed
the
bourbons
might
regain
their
throne
it
was
his
resistless
genius
alone
which
enabled
france
to
triumph
over
combined
europe
his
death
would
leave
france
without
a
leader
the
armies
of
the
allies
could
then
with
bloody
strides
march
to
paris
and
place
the
hated
bourbons
on
the
throne
france
knew
this
and
adored
its
preserver
monarchical
europe
knew
this
and
hence
all
the
engergies
of
its
combined
kings
were
centred
upon
napoleon
more
than
thirty
of
these
consipracies
were
detected
by
the
police
london
was
the
where
they
were
engendered
were
aimed
to
napoleon
assassins
dogged
him
with
their
poniards
a
was
invented
weighing
about
fifteen
pounds
which
was
to
be
thrown
in
at
his
and
which
exploding
by
its
own
concussion
would
hurl
death
on
every
side
the
conspirators
were
perfectly
reckless
of
the
lives
of
others
if
they
could
only
destroy
the
life
of
napoleon
the
agents
of
the
had
the
barbarity
to
get
a
young
girl
fifteen
years
of
age
to
hold
the
horse
who
drew
the
machine
this
was
to
disarm
suspicion
the
poor
child
was
blown
into
such
fragments
that
no
part
of
her
body
excepting
the
feet
could
afterwards
be
found
at
last
napoleon
became
aroused
and
declared
that
he
would
teach
those
bourbons
that
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
shot
at
like
a
dog
one
day
at
helena
as
he
was
putting
on
his
flannel
waistcoat
he
observed
las
casas
looking
at
him
very
steadfastly
well
what
is
your
excellency
thinking
of
said
napoleon
with
a
smile
sire
las

replied
in
a
pamphlet
which
i
lately
read
i
found
it
stated
that
your
majesty
was
shielded
by
a
for
the
security
of
your
person
i
was
thinking
that
i
could
bear
positive
evidence
that
at
helena
at
least
all
precautions
for
personal
safety
have
been
laid
aside
this
said
napoleon
is
one
of
the
thousand
absurdities
which
have
just
mentioned
is
the
more
ridiculous
since
every
individual
about
me
well
knows
how
careless
i
am
with
regard
to
accustomed
from
the
age
of
eighteen
to
be
exposed
to
the
and
knowing
the
inutility
of
precautions
i
abandoned
myself
to
my
fate
when
i
came
to
the
head
of
affairs
i
might
still
have
fancied
myself
surrounded
by
the
dangers
of
the
field
of
battle
and
i
might
have
regarded
the
conspiracies
which
were
formed
against
me
as
so
many
but
i
followed
my
old
course
i
trusted
to
my
lucky
star
and
left
all
precautions
to
the
police
i
was
perhaps
the
only
sovereign
in
europe
who
dispensed
with
a
every
one
could
freely
approach
me
without
having
as
it
were
to
pass
through
military
barracks
maria
lousia
was
much
astonished
to
see
me
so
poorly
guarded
and
she
often
remarked
that
her
father
was
surrounded
by
bayonets
for
my
part
i
had
no
better
defense
at
the
tuileries
than
i
have
here
i
do
not
even
know
where
to
find
my
sword
said
he
looking
around
the
room
do
you
see
it
i
have
to
be
sure
incurred
great
dangers
upward
of
thirty
plots
were
found
against
me
these
have
been
proved
by
authentic
testimony
without
mentioning
many
which
never
came
to
light
some
sovereigns
invent
conspiracies
against
themselves
for
my
part
i
made
it
a
rule
carefully
to
conceal
them
whenever
i
could
the
crisis
most
serious
to
me
was
during
the
interval
from
the
battle
of
marengo
to
the
attempt
of
george
cadoudal
and
the
affair
of
the
duke
napoleon
now
with
his
accustomed
vigor
took
hold
of
the
robbers
an
and
made
short
work
with
them
the
insurgent
armies
of
la
vendee
numbering
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
men
and
filled
with
adventurers
and
desperadoes
of
every
kind
were
disbanded
when
their
chiefs
yielded
homage
to
napoleon
many
of
these
men
accustomed
to
banditti
warfare
took
to
the
highways
the
roads
were
so
infested
by
them
that
travailing
became
exceedingly
perilous
and
it
was
necessary
that
every
which
left
paris
should
be
accompanied
by
a
guard
of
armed
soldiers
to
remedy
a
state
of
society
thus
convulsed
to
its
very
centre
special
tribunals
were
organized
consisting
of
eight
judges
they
were
to
take
cognizance
of
all
such
crimes
as
conspiracies
robberies
and
acts
of
violence
of
any
kind
the
armed
bands
of
napoleon
swept
over
france
like
a
whirlwind
the
robbers
were
seized
tried
and
shot
without
delay
order
was
at
once
restored
the
people
thought
not
of
the
dangerous
power
they
were
placing
in
the
hands
of
the
first
consul
they
asked
only
for
a
commander
who
was
able
and
willing
to
quell
the
tumult
of
the
times
such
a
commander
they
found
in
napoleon
they
were
more
than
willing
to
confer
upon
him
all
the
power
he
could
desire
you
know
what
is
best
for
us
said
the
people
of
napoleon
direct
us
what
to
do
and
we
will
do
it
it
was
thus
that
absolute
power
came
voluntarily
into
his
hands
under
the
circumstances
it
was
so
natural
that
it
can
excite
no
suspicion
he
was
called
first
consul
but
he
already
swayed
a
scepter
more
mighty
than
that
of
the
caesars
but
sixteen
months
had
now
elapsed
since
napoleon
landed
at
frejus
in
that
time
he
had
attained
the
throne
of
france
he
had
caused
order
and
prosperity
to
emerge
from
the
chaos
of
revolution
by
his
magnanimity
he
had
disarmed
russia
by
his
armies
had
humbled
austria
and
had
compelled
continental
europe
to
accept
an
honorable
peace
he
merited
the
gratitude
of
his
countrymen
and
he
received
it
in
overflowing
measure
through
all
these
incidents
so
eventful
and
so
full
of
difficulty
it
is
not
easy
to
point
to
a
single
act
of
napoleon
which
indicates
a
malicious
or
an
ungenerous
spirit
i
fear
nothing
said
napoleon
at
helena
for
my
renown
posterity
will
do
me
justice
it
will
compare
the
good
which
i
have
done
with
faults
which
i
have
committed
if
i
had
succeeded
i
should
have
died
with
the
reputation
of
being
the
greatest
man
who
ever
existed
from
being
nothing
i
became
by
my
own
exertions
the
most
powerful
monarch
of
the
universe
without
committing
any
crime
my
ambition
was
great
but
it
rested
on
the
opinion
of
the
masses
i
have
always
thought
that
sovereignty
resides
in
the
people
the
empire
as
i
had
organized
it
was
but
a
great
republic
called
to
the
throne
by
the
voice
of
the
people
my
maxim
has
always
been
a
career
open
to
talent
without
distinction
of
birth
it
is
for
this
system
of
equality
that
the
european
oligarchy
detests
me
and
yet
in
england
talent
and
great
services
raise
a
man
to
the
highest
rank
england
should
have
understood
me
the
french
revolution
said
napoleon
was
a
general
movement
of
the
mass
of
the
nation
against
the
privileged
classes
the
nobles
were
exempt
from
the
burdens
of
the
state
and
yet
exclusively
occupied
all
the
posts
of
honor
and
emolument
the
revolution
destroyed
these
exclusive
privileges
and
established
equality
of
rights
all
the
avenues
of
wealth
and
greatness
were
equally
open
to
every
citizen
according
to
his
talents
the
french
nation
established
the
imperial
throne
and
placed
me
upon
it
the
throne
of
france
was
granted
before
to
hugh
capet
by
a
few
bishops
and
nobles
the
imperial
throne
was
given
to
me
by
the
desire
of
the
people
joseph
bonaparte
was
of
very
essential
service
to
napoleon
in
the
diplomatic
intercourse
of
the
times
lucien
also
was
employed
in
various
ways
and
the
whole
family
were
taken
under
the
protection
of
the
first
consul
at
helena
napoleon
uttered
the
following
graphic
and
truthful
eulogium
upon
his
brothers
and
sisters
what
family
in
similar
circumstances
would
have
acted
better
every
one
is
not
qualified
to
be
a
statesman
that
requires
a
combination
of
powers
which
does
not
often
fall
to
the
lot
of
any
one
in
this
respect
all
my
brothers
were
singularly
situated
they
possessed
at
once
too
much
and
too
little
talent
they
felt
themselves
too
strong
to
resign
themselves
blindly
to
a
guiding
counselor
and
yet
too
weak
to
be
left
entirely
to
themselves
but
take
them
all
in
all
i
have
certainly
good
reason
to
be
proud
of
my
family
joseph
would
have
been
an
honor
to
society
in
any
country
and
lucien
would
have
been
an
honor
to
any
assembly
jerome
as
he
advanced
in
life
would
have
developed
every
qualification
requisite
in
a
sovereign
louis
would
have
been
distinguished
in
any
rank
or
condition
of
life
my
sister
eliza
was
endowed
with
masculine
powers
of
mind
she
must
have
proved
herself
a
philosopher
in
her
adverse
fortune
caroline
possessed
great
talents
and
capacity
pauline
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
woman
of
her
age
has
been
and
will
continue
to
the
end
of
her
life
the
most
amiable
creature
in
the
world
as
to
my
mother
she
deserves
all
kinds
of
veneration
how
seldom
is
so
numerous
a
family
entitled
to
so
much
praise
add
to
this
that
setting
aside
the
jarring
of
political
opinions
we
sincerely
loved
each
other
for
my
part
i
never
ceased
to
cherish
fraternal
affection
for
them
all
and
i
am
convinced
that
in
their
hearts
they
felt
the
same
sentiments
toward
me
and
that
in
case
of
need
they
would
have
given
me
every
proof
of
it
the
proud
old
nobility
whom
napoleon
had
restored
to
france
and
upon
many
of
whom
he
had
conferred
their
confiscated
estates
manifested
no
gratitude
toward
their
benefactor
they
were
sighting
for
the
of
the
bourbons
and
for
the
return
of
the
good
old
times
when
all
the
offices
of
emolument
and
honor
were
reserved
for
them
and
for
their
children
and
the
people
were
but
their
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
in
the
morning
as
beggars
they
would
crowd
the
of
the
first
consul
with
their
petitions
in
the
evening
they
disdained
to
honor
his
levees
with
their
presence
they
spoke
contemptuously
of
josephine
of
her
kindness
and
her
desire
to
conciliate
all
parties
they
condemned
every
thing
that
napoleon
did
he
however
paid
no
heed
to
their
murmurings
he
would
not
condescend
even
to
punish
them
by
neglect
in
that
most
lofty
pride
which
induced
him
to
say
that
in
his
administration
he
wished
to
imitate
the
elemency
of
god
he
endeavored
to
consult
for
the
interests
of
all
both
the
evil
and
the
unthankful
his
fame
was
to
consist
not
in
revenging
himself
upon
his
enemies
but
in
aggrandizing
france
at
this
time
napoleon
establishment
at
the
tuileries
rather
resembled
that
of
a
very
rich
gentleman
than
the
court
of
a
monarch
junot
one
of
his
aids
was
married
to
mademoiselle
permon
the
young
lady
whose
name
will
be
remembered
in
connection
with
the
anecdote
of
puss
in
boots
her
mother
was
one
of
the
most
haughty
of
the
ancient
nobility
who
affected
to
look
upon
napoleon
with
contempt
as
not
of
royal
blood
the
evening
after
her
marriage
madame
junot
was
to
be
presented
to
josephine
after
the
opera
she
drove
to
the
tuileries
it
was
near
eleven
as
josephine
had
appointed
the
hour
she
was
expected
eugene
hearing
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
descended
to
the
presented
his
arm
to
madame
junot
and
they
entered
the
large
saloon
together
it
was
a
magnificent
apartment
magnificently
furnished
two
chandeliers
surrounded
with
gauze
to
soften
the
glare
shed
a
subdued
and
grateful
light
over
the
room
josephine
was
seated
before
a
working
upon
embroidery
near
her
sat
hortense
in
figure
and
surpassingly
gentle
and
graceful
in
her
manners
napoleon
was
standing
near
josephine
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
engaged
in
conversation
with
his
wife
and
her
lovely
daughter
upon
the
entrance
of
madame
junot
josephine
immediately
arose
took
her
two
hands
and
affectionately
kissing
her
said
i
have
too
long
been
junot
friend
not
to
entertain
the
same
sentiments
for
his
wife
particularly
for
the
one
he
has
chosen
oh
josephine
said
napoleon
that
is
running
on
very
fast
how
do
you
know
that
this
little
pickle
is
worth
loving
well
mademoiselle
loulou
you
see
that
i
do
not
forget
the
names
of
my
old
friends
have
you
not
a
word
for
me
saying
this
he
gently
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
toward
him
the
young
bride
was
much
embarrassed
and
yet
she
struggled
to
retain
her
pride
of
birth
general
she
replied
smiling
it
is
not
for
me
to
speak
first
very
well
parried
said
napoleon
playfully
the
mother
spirit
and
how
is
madame
permon
very
ill
general
for
two
years
her
health
has
caused
us
great
uneasiness
indeed
said
napoleon
so
bad
as
that
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
very
sorry
make
my
regards
to
her
it
is
a
wrong
head
a
proud
spirit
but
she
has
a
generous
heart
and
a
noble
soul
i
hope
that
we
shall
often
see
you
madame
junot
my
intention
is
to
draw
around
me
a
numerous
family
consisting
of
my
generals
and
their
young
wives
they
will
be
of
my
wife
and
of
hortense
as
their
husbands
are
my
friends
but
you
must
not
expect
to
meet
here
your
acquaintances
of
the
ancient
nobility
i
do
not
like
them
they
are
my
enemies
and
prove
it
by
defaming
this
was
but
the
morning
twilight
of
that
imperial
splendor
which
afterward
dazzled
the
most
powerful
potentates
of
europe
hortense
who
subsequently
became
the
wife
of
louis
bonaparte
and
the
mother
of
louis
napoleon
who
at
the
moment
of
this
present
writing
is
at
the
head
of
the
government
of
france
was
then
seventeen
years
of
age
she
was
madame
junot
fresh
as
a
rose
though
her
fair
complexion
was
not
relieved
by
much
color
she
had
enough
to
produce
that
freshness
and
bloom
which
was
her
chief
beauty
a
profusion
of
light
hair
played
in
silken
locks
around
her
soft
and
penetrating
blue
eyes
the
delicate
roundness
of
her
figure
slender
as
a
was
set
off
by
the
elegant
carriage
of
her
head
but
that
which
formed
the
chief
attraction
of
hortense
was
the
grace
and
suavity
of
her
manners
which
united
the
creole
nonchalance
with
the
vivacity
of
france
she
was
gay
gentle
and
amiable
she
had
wit
which
without
the
smallest
had
just
malice
enough
to
be
amusing
a
polished
and
education
had
improved
her
natural
talents
she
drew
excellently
sang
harmoniously
and
performed
admirably
in
comedy
in
she
was
a
charming
young
girl
she
afterward
became
one
of
the
most
amiable
princesses
in
europe
i
have
seen
many
both
in
their
own
courts
and
in
paris
but
i
have
never
known
one
who
had
any
pretensions
to
equal
talents
she
was
beloved
by
every
one
her
brother
loved
her
tenderly
the
first
consul
looked
upon
her
as
his
child
napoleon
has
been
accused
of
an
improper
affection
for
hortense
the
world
has
been
filled
with
the
slander
says
bourrienne
napoleon
never
cherished
for
her
any
feeling
but
a
real
paternal
tenderness
he
loved
her
after
his
marriage
with
her
mother
as
he
would
have
loved
his
own
child
at
least
for
three
years
i
was
a
witness
to
all
their
most
private
actions
and
i
declare
i
never
saw
any
thing
that
could
furnish
the
least
ground
for
suspicion
nor
the
slightest
trace
of
a
culpable
intimacy
this
calumny
must
be
classed
among
those
which
malice
delights
to
take
in
the
character
of
men
who
become
celebrated
calumnies
which
are
adopted
lightly
and
without
reflection
napoleon
is
no
more
let
his
memory
be
accompanied
only
by
that
be
it
good
or
bad
which
really
took
place
let
not
this
reproach
be
made
a
charge
against
him
by
the
impartial
historian
i
must
say
in
conclusion
on
this
delicate
subject
that
his
principles
were
rigid
in
an
extreme
degree
and
that
any
fault
of
the
nature
charged
neither
entered
his
mind
nor
was
in
accordance
with
his
morals
or
his
taste
at
helena
napoleon
was
one
day
looking
over
a
book
containing
an
account
of
his
amours
he
smiled
as
he
glanced
his
eye
over
the
pages
saying
i
do
not
even
know
the
names
of
most
of
the
females
who
are
mentioned
here
this
is
all
very
foolish
every
body
knows
that
had
no
time
for
such
dissipation
one
beautiful
evening
in
the
year
the
parish
priest
of
san
pietro
a
village
a
few
miles
distant
from
sevilla
returned
much
fatigued
to
his
little
cottage
where
he
found
his
aged
housekeeper
the
senora
margarita
watching
for
him
notwithstanding
that
one
is
well
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
poverty
in
spain
it
was
impossible
to
help
being
struck
by
the
utter
of
destitution
which
appeared
in
the
house
of
the
good
priest
the
more
so
as
every
imaginable
contrivance
had
been
restored
to
to
hide
the
nakedness
of
the
walls
and
the
shabbiness
of
the
furniture
margarita
had
prepared
for
her
master
super
a
rather
small
dish
of
which
consisted
to
say
the
truth
of
the
remains
of
the
dinner
seasoned
and
disguised
with
great
skill
and
with
the
addition
of
some
sauce
and
a
name
as
she
placed
the
savory
dish
upon
the
table
the
priest
said
we
should
thank
god
for
this
good
supper
margarita
this
makes
one
mouth
water
my
friend
you
ought
to
be
grateful
for
finding
so
good
a
supper
at
the
house
of
your
host
at
the
word
host
margarita
raised
her
eyes
and
saw
a
stranger
who
had
followed
her
mater
her
countenance
changed
and
she
looked
annoyed
she
glanced
indignantly
first
at
the
unknown
and
then
at
the
priest
who
looking
down
said
in
a
low
voice
and
with
the
timidity
of
a
child
what
is
enough
for
two
is
always
enough
for
three
and
surely
you
would
not
wish
that
i
should
allow
a
christian
to
die
of
hunger
he
has
not
tasted
food
for
two
days
a
christian
he
is
more
like
a
brigand
and
margarita
let
the
room
murmuring
loudly
enough
to
be
heard
meanwhile
the
unwelcome
guest
had
remained
standing
at
the
door
he
was
a
man
of
great
height
in
rags
and
covered
with
mud
while
his
black
hair
piercing
eyes
and
carbine
gave
him
an
appearance
which
though
hardly
prepossessing
was
certainly
interesting
must
i
go
said
he
the
priest
replied
with
an
emphatic
gesture
those
whom
i
bring
under
my
roof
are
never
driven
forth
and
are
never
unwelcome
put
down
your
carbine
let
us
say
grace
and
go
to
table
i
never
leave
my
carbine
for
as
the
castilian
proverb
says
two
friends
are
one
my
carbine
is
my
best
friend
and
i
always
keep
it
beside
me
although
you
allow
me
to
come
into
your
house
and
do
not
oblige
me
to
leave
until
i
wish
to
do
so
there
are
others
who
would
think
nothing
of
hauling
me
out
and
perhaps
with
me
feet
foremost
come
to
your
good
health
mine
host
and
let
us
to
supper
the
priest
possessed
an
extremely
good
appetite
but
the
voracity
of
the
stranger
soon
obliged
him
to
give
up
for
not
contented
with
eating
or
rather
devouring
nearly
the
whole
of
the
the
guest
finished
a
large
loaf
of
bread
without
leaving
a
crumb
while
he
ate
he
kept
continually
looking
round
with
an
expression
of
inquietude
he
started
at
the
slightest
sound
and
once
when
a
violent
gust
of
wind
made
the
door
bang
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
seized
his
carbine
with
an
air
which
showed
that
if
necessary
he
would
sell
his
life
dearly
discovering
the
cause
of
the
alarm
he
reseated
himself
at
table
and
finished
his
repast
now
said
he
i
have
one
thing
more
to
ask
i
have
been
wounded
and
for
eight
days
my
wound
has
not
been
dressed
give
me
a
few
old
rags
and
you
shall
be
no
longer
burdened
with
my
presence
i
am
in
no
haste
for
you
to
go
replied
the
priest
whose
quest
notwithstanding
his
constant
watchfulness
had
conversed
very
entertainingly
i
know
something
of
surgery
and
will
dress
your
wound
so
saying
he
took
from
a
cupboard
a
case
containing
every
thing
necessary
and
proceeded
to
do
as
he
had
said
the
stranger
had
bled
profusely
a
ball
having
passed
through
his
thigh
and
to
have
traveled
in
this
condition
and
while
suffering
too
from
want
of
food
showed
a
strength
which
seemed
hardly
human
you
can
not
possibly
continue
your
journey
said
the
host
you
must
pass
the
night
here
a
little
rest
will
get
up
your
strength
diminish
the
inflammation
of
your
wound
and
i
must
go
to
day
and
immediately
interrupted
the
stranger
there
are
some
who
wait
for
me
he
added
with
a
sigh
and
there
are
some
too
who
follow
me
and
the
momentary
look
of
softness
passed
from
his
features
between
the
clauses
of
the
sentence
and
gave
place
to
an
expression
almost
of
ferocity
now
is
it
finished
that
is
well
see
i
can
walk
as
firmly
as
though
i
had
never
been
wounded
give
me
some
bread
pay
yourself
for
your
hospitality
with
this
piece
of
gold
and
adieu
the
priest
put
back
the
gold
with
displeasure
i
am
not
an
innkeeper
said
he
and
i
do
not
sell
my
hospitality
as
you
will
but
pardon
me
and
now
farewell
my
kind
host
so
saying
he
took
the
bread
which
margarita
at
her
master
command
very
unwillingly
gave
him
and
soon
his
tall
figure
disappeared
among
the
thick
foliage
of
a
wood
which
surrounded
the
house
or
rather
the
cabin
an
hour
had
scarcely
passed
when
were
heard
close
by
and
the
unknown
reappeared
deadly
pale
and
bleeding
from
a
deep
wound
near
the
heart
take
these
said
he
giving
pieces
of
gold
to
his
late
host
they
are
for
my
children
near
the
stream
in
the
valley
missing
pages
deadly
agency
which
it
had
power
to
exert
even
the
roadway
leading
up
and
down
the
mountain
is
not
always
safe
it
would
seem
from
these
dangerous
intruders
it
is
rocky
and
solitary
and
is
bordered
every
where
with
gloomy
ravines
and
chasms
all
filled
with
dense
and
entangled
thickets
in
which
and
in
the
cavernous
rocks
of
which
the
strata
of
the
mountain
are
composed
wild
beast
and
noxious
animals
of
every
kind
find
a
secure
retreat
the
monks
relate
that
not
many
years
ago
a
servant
of
the
convent
who
had
been
sent
down
the
mountain
to
haifa
to
accompany
a
traveler
was
attacked
and
seized
by
a
panther
on
his
return
the
panther
however
instead
of
putting
his
victim
immediately
to
death
began
to
play
with
him
as
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
which
she
has
succeeded
in
making
her
him
gently
with
her
claws
for
a
time
and
then
after
drawing
back
a
little
darting
upon
him
again
as
if
to
repeat
and
renew
the
pleasure
of
capturing
such
a
prize
this
was
continued
so
long
that
the
cries
of
the
terrified
captive
brought
to
the
spot
some
persons
that
chanced
to
be
near
when
the
panther
was
terrified
in
her
turn
and
fled
into
the
forests
and
then
the
man
was
rescued
from
his
horrible
situation
unharmed
for
these
and
similar
reasons
travelers
who
ascend
to
the
convent
of
mt
carmel
enjoy
but
little
liberty
there
but
most
confine
their
explorations
in
most
cases
to
the
buildings
of
the
monks
and
to
some
of
the
nearest
caves
of
the
ancient
recluses
still
the
spot
is
rendered
so
attractive
by
the
salubrity
of
the
air
the
intrinsic
beauty
of
the
situation
the
magnificence
of
the
prospect
and
the
kind
and
attentive
demeanor
of
the
monks
that
some
visitors
have
recommended
it
as
a
place
of
permanent
resort
for
those
who
leave
their
homes
in
the
west
in
pursuit
of
health
or
in
search
of
retirement
and
repose
the
rule
that
requires
those
who
have
been
guests
of
the
convent
more
than
two
weeks
to
give
place
to
others
more
recently
arrived
proves
in
facto
be
no
serious
difficulty
some
kind
of
an
arrangement
can
in
such
cases
always
be
made
though
it
is
seldom
that
any
occasion
arises
that
requires
it
the
quarters
too
though
plain
and
simple
are
comfortable
and
neat
and
although
the
visitor
is
somewhat
restricted
from
causes
that
have
already
been
named
in
respect
to
explorations
of
the
mountain
itself
there
are
many
excursions
that
can
be
made
in
the
country
below
of
a
very
attractive
character
he
can
visit
haifa
he
can
ride
or
walk
along
the
beach
to
acre
he
can
go
to
nazareth
or
journey
down
the
coast
passing
round
the
western
declivity
of
the
mountain
in
these
and
similar
rambles
he
will
find
scenes
of
continual
novelty
to
attract
him
and
be
surrounded
every
where
with
the
forms
and
usages
of
oriental
life
the
traveler
who
comes
to
mt
carmel
by
the
way
of
nazareth
and
the
plain
of
esdraelon
in
going
away
from
it
generally
passes
round
the
western
declivity
of
the
mountain
and
thence
proceeds
to
the
south
by
the
way
of
the
sea
on
reaching
the
foot
of
the
descent
where
the
mountain
comes
out
into
the
main
road
as
shown
upon
the
map
near
the
commencement
of
this
article
he
turns
shorts
to
the
left
and
goes
on
round
the
base
of
the
promontory
with
the
lofty
declivities
of
the
mountain
on
one
hand
and
a
mass
of
dense
forests
on
the
other
lying
between
the
road
and
the
shore
as
he
passes
on
the
road
picturesque
and
romantic
from
the
beginning
becomes
gradually
wild
solitary
and
desolate
it
leads
him
sometimes
through
tangled
thickets
sometimes
under
shelving
rocks
and
sometimes
it
brings
him
out
unexpectedly
to
the
shore
of
the
sea
where
he
sees
the
surf
rolling
in
upon
the
beach
at
his
feet
and
far
over
the
water
the
setting
sun
going
down
to
his
rest
beneath
the
western
horizon
at
length
the
twilight
gradually
disappears
and
as
the
shades
of
the
evening
come
on
lights
glimmer
in
the
solitary
villages
that
he
passes
on
his
way
but
there
is
no
welcome
for
him
in
their
beaming
at
length
when
he
deems
it
time
to
bring
his
day
journey
to
an
end
he
pitches
his
tent
by
the
wayside
in
some
unfrequented
spot
and
before
he
retires
to
rest
for
the
night
comes
out
to
take
one
more
view
of
the
dark
and
sombre
mountain
which
he
is
about
to
leave
forever
he
stands
at
the
door
of
his
tent
and
gazes
at
it
long
and
earnestly
before
he
bids
it
farewell
equally
impressed
with
the
sublime
magnificence
of
its
situation
and
form
and
with
the
solemn
grandeur
of
its
history
france
was
now
at
peace
with
all
the
world
it
was
universally
admitted
that
napoleon
was
the
great
pacificator
he
was
the
idol
of
france
the
masses
of
the
people
in
europe
every
where
regarded
him
as
their
advocate
and
friend
the
enemy
of
aristocratic
usurpation
and
the
great
champion
of
equality
the
people
of
france
no
longer
demanded
liberty
weary
years
of
woe
had
taught
them
gladly
to
relinquish
the
boon
they
only
desired
a
ruler
who
would
take
care
of
them
govern
them
protect
them
from
the
power
of
allied
despotism
and
give
them
equal
rights
though
napoleon
had
now
but
the
title
of
first
consul
and
france
was
nominally
a
republic
he
was
in
reality
the
most
powerful
monarch
in
europe
his
throne
was
established
in
the
hearts
of
nearly
forty
millions
of
people
his
word
was
law
it
will
be
remembered
that
josephine
contemplated
the
extraordinary
grandeur
to
which
her
husband
had
attained
with
intense
solicitude
she
saw
that
more
that
than
ordinary
regal
power
had
passed
into
his
hands
and
she
was
not
a
stranger
to
the
intense
desire
which
animated
his
heart
to
have
an
heir
to
whom
to
transmit
his
name
and
his
glory
she
knew
that
many
were
intimating
to
him
that
an
heir
was
essential
to
the
repose
of
france
she
was
fully
informed
that
divorce
had
been
urged
upon
him
as
one
of
the
stern
necessities
of
state
one
day
when
napoleon
was
busy
in
his
cabinet
josephine
entered
softly
by
a
side
door
and
seating
herself
affectionately
upon
his
knee
and
passing
her
hand
gently
through
his
hair
said
to
him
with
a
burst
of
tenderness
i
entreat
you
my
friend
do
not
make
yourself
king
it
is
lucien
who
urges
you
to
it
do
not
listen
to
him
napoleon
smiled
upon
her
kindly
and
said
why
my
poor
josephine
you
are
mad
you
must
not
listen
to
these
fables
which
the
old
dowagers
tell
you
but
you
interrupt
me
now
i
am
very
busy
leave
me
alone
it
is
recorded
that
lucien
ventured
to
suggest
to
josephine
that
a
law
higher
than
the
law
of
ordinary
morality
required
that
she
must
become
a
mother
even
were
it
necessary
for
the
attainment
of
that
end
that
she
should
violate
her
nuptial
vows
brutalizing
and
vulgar
infidelity
had
obliterated
in
france
nearly
all
the
sacredness
of
domestic
ties
josephine
instinctively
virtuous
and
revering
the
religion
of
her
childhood
which
her
husband
had
reinstated
bursting
into
tears
indignantly
exclaimed
this
is
dreadful
wretched
should
i
be
were
any
one
to
suppose
me
capable
of
listening
without
horror
to
your
infamous
proposal
your
ideas
are
poisonous
your
language
horrible
well
then
madame
responded
lucien
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
from
my
heart
i
pity
you
josephine
was
at
times
almost
delirious
in
apprehension
of
the
awful
calamity
which
threatened
her
she
knew
the
intensity
of
her
husband
love
she
also
knew
the
boundlessness
of
his
ambition
she
could
not
be
blind
to
the
apparent
importance
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
that
napoleon
should
possess
an
heir
she
also
was
fully
aware
that
throughout
france
marriage
had
long
been
regarded
but
as
a
partnership
of
convenience
to
be
formed
and
sundered
almost
at
pleasure
marriage
said
madame
de
stael
has
become
but
the
sacrament
of
adultery
the
nation
under
the
influence
of
these
views
would
condemn
her
for
selfishly
refusing
assent
to
an
arrangement
apparently
essential
to
the
repose
of
france
and
of
europe
never
was
a
woman
placed
in
a
situation
of
more
terrible
trial
never
was
an
ambitious
man
exposed
to
a
more
fiery
temptation
laying
aside
the
authority
of
christianity
and
contemplating
the
subject
in
the
light
of
mere
expediency
it
seemed
a
plain
duty
for
napoleon
and
josephine
to
separate
but
gloriously
does
it
illustrate
the
immutable
truth
of
god
word
that
even
in
such
an
exigence
as
this
the
path
which
the
bible
pointed
out
was
the
only
path
of
safety
and
of
peace
in
separating
myself
from
josephine
said
napoleon
afterward
and
in
marrying
maria
louisa
i
placed
my
foot
upon
an
abyss
which
was
covered
with
flowers
josephine
daughter
hortense
beautiful
brilliant
and
amiable
then
but
eighteen
years
of
age
was
strongly
attached
to
duroc
one
of
napoleon
aids
a
very
fashionable
and
handsome
man
josephine
however
had
conceived
the
idea
of
marrying
hortense
to
louis
bonaparte
napoleon
younger
brother
she
said
one
day
to
bourrienne
my
two
are
my
determined
enemies
you
see
all
their
intrigues
you
know
how
much
uneasiness
they
have
caused
me
this
projected
marriage
with
duroc
leaves
me
without
any
support
duroc
independent
of
bonaparte
friendship
is
nothing
he
has
neither
fortune
rank
nor
even
reputation
he
can
afford
me
no
protection
against
the
enmity
of
the
brothers
i
must
have
some
more
certain
reliance
for
the
future
my
husband
loves
louis
very
much
if
i
can
succeed
in
uniting
my
daughter
to
him
he
will
prove
a
strong
counterpoise
to
the
calumnies
and
persecutions
of
my
these
remarks
were
reported
to
napoleon
he
replied
josephine
labors
in
vain
duroc
and
hortense
love
each
other
and
they
shall
be
married
i
am
attached
to
duroc
he
is
well
born
i
have
given
caroline
to
murat
and
pauline
to
le
clerc
i
can
as
well
give
hortense
to
duroc
he
is
brave
he
is
as
good
as
the
others
he
is
general
of
division
besides
i
have
other
views
for
louis
in
the
palace
the
heart
may
throb
with
the
same
joys
and
griefs
as
in
the
cottage
in
anticipation
of
the
projected
marriage
duroc
was
sent
on
a
special
mission
to
compliment
the
emperor
alexander
on
his
accession
to
the
throne
duroc
wrote
often
to
hortense
while
absent
when
the
private
secretary
whispered
in
her
ears
in
the
midst
of
the
brilliant
throng
of
the
tuileries
i
have
a
letter
she
would
immediately
retire
to
her
apartment
upon
her
return
her
friends
could
see
that
her
eyes
were
moistened
with
the
tears
of
affection
and
joy
josephine
cherished
the
hope
that
could
she
succeed
in
uniting
hortense
with
louis
bonaparte
should
hortense
give
birth
to
a
son
napoleon
would
regard
him
as
his
heir
the
child
would
bear
the
name
of
bonaparte
the
blood
of
the
bonapartes
would
circulate
in
his
veins
and
he
would
be
the
offspring
of
hortense
whom
napoleon
regarded
as
his
own
daughter
and
whom
he
loved
with
the
strongest
parental
affection
thus
the
terrible
divorce
might
be
averted
urged
by
motives
so
powerful
josephine
left
no
means
untried
to
accomplish
her
purpose
louis
bonaparte
was
a
studious
pensive
imaginative
man
of
great
moral
worth
though
possessing
but
little
force
of
character
he
had
been
bitterly
disappointed
in
his
affections
and
was
weary
of
the
world
when
but
nineteen
years
of
age
he
had
formed
a
very
strong
attachment
for
a
young
lady
whom
he
had
met
in
paris
she
was
the
daughter
of
an
emigrant
noble
and
his
whole
being
because
absorbed
in
the
passion
of
love
napoleon
then
in
the
midst
of
those
victories
which
paved
his
way
to
the
throne
of
france
was
apprehensive
that
the
alliance
of
his
brother
with
one
of
the
old
royalist
families
might
endanger
his
own
ambitious
projects
he
therefore
sent
him
away
on
a
military
commission
and
secured
by
his
powerful
instrumentality
the
marriage
of
the
young
lady
to
another
person
the
disappointment
preyed
deeply
upon
the
heart
of
the
sensitive
young
man
all
ambition
died
within
him
he
loved
solitude
and
studiously
avoided
the
cares
and
pomp
of
state
napoleon
not
having
been
aware
of
the
extreme
strength
of
his
brother
attachment
when
he
saw
the
wound
which
he
had
inflicted
upon
him
endeavored
to
make
all
the
amends
in
his
power
hortense
was
beautiful
full
of
grace
and
vivacity
at
last
napoleon
fell
in
with
the
views
of
josephine
and
resolved
having
united
the
two
to
recompense
his
brother
as
far
as
possible
by
lavishing
great
favors
upon
them
it
was
long
before
louis
would
listen
to
the
proposition
of
his
marriage
with
hortense
his
affections
still
clung
to
the
lost
object
of
his
idolatry
and
he
could
not
without
pain
think
of
union
with
another
indeed
a
more
uncongenial
alliance
could
hardly
have
been
imagined
in
no
one
thing
were
their
tastes
similar
but
who
could
resist
the
combined
tact
of
josephine
and
power
of
napoleon
all
obstacles
were
swept
away
and
the
maiden
loving
the
hilarity
of
life
and
its
gayest
scenes
of
festivity
and
splendor
was
reluctantly
led
to
the
silent
pensive
scholar
who
as
reluctantly
received
her
as
his
bride
hortense
had
become
in
some
degree
reconciled
to
the
match
as
her
powerful
father
promised
to
place
them
in
high
positions
of
wealth
and
rank
louis
resigned
himself
to
his
lot
feeling
the
earth
had
no
further
joy
in
store
for
him
a
magnificent
fete
was
given
in
honor
of
this
marriage
at
which
all
the
splendors
of
the
ancient
royalty
were
revived
louis
napoleon
bonaparte
who
as
president
of
the
french
republic
succeeded
louis
philippe
the
king
of
the
french
was
the
only
child
of
this
marriage
who
survived
his
parents
napoleon
had
organized
in
the
heart
of
italy
a
republic
containing
about
five
millions
of
inhabitants
this
republic
could
by
no
means
maintain
itself
against
the
monarchies
of
europe
unaided
by
france
napoleon
surrounded
by
hostile
kings
deemed
it
essential
to
the
safety
of
france
to
secure
in
italy
a
nation
of
congenial
sympathies
and
interests
with
whom
he
could
form
the
alliance
of
cordial
friendship
the
italians
all
inexperienced
in
regarding
napoleon
as
their
benefactor
and
their
sole
supporter
looked
to
him
for
a
constitution
three
of
the
most
influential
men
of
the
cisalpine
republic
were
sent
as
delegates
to
paris
to
consult
with
the
first
consul
upon
the
organization
of
their
government
under
the
direction
of
napoleon
a
constitution
was
drafted
which
considering
the
character
of
the
italian
people
and
the
hostile
monarchicals
influences
which
surrounded
them
was
most
highly
liberal
a
president
was
were
to
be
chosen
for
ten
years
there
was
to
be
a
senate
of
eight
members
and
a
house
of
representatives
of
members
there
were
all
to
be
selected
from
a
body
composed
of
landed
proprietors
of
the
clergy
and
prominent
literary
men
thus
all
the
important
interests
of
the
state
were
represented
in
italy
as
in
all
the
other
countries
of
europe
at
that
time
there
were
three
prominent
parties
the
loyalists
sought
the
restoration
of
monarchy
and
the
exclusive
privileges
of
kings
and
nobles
the
moderate
republicans
wished
to
establish
a
firm
government
which
would
enforce
order
and
confer
upon
all
equal
rights
the
jacobins
wished
to
break
down
all
distinctions
divide
property
and
to
govern
by
the
blind
energies
of
the
mob
italy
had
long
been
held
in
subjection
by
the
spiritual
terrors
of
the
priests
and
by
the
bayonets
of
the
austrians
ages
of
bondage
had
enervated
the
people
and
there
were
no
italian
statesmen
capable
of
taking
the
helm
of
government
in
such
a
turbulent
sea
of
troubles
napoleon
resolved
to
have
himself
proposed
as
president
and
then
reserving
to
himself
the
supreme
direction
to
delegate
the
details
of
affairs
to
distinguished
italians
until
they
should
in
some
degree
be
trained
to
duties
so
new
to
them
says
theirs
this
plan
was
not
on
his
part
the
inspiration
of
ambition
but
rather
of
great
good
sense
his
views
on
this
occasion
were
unquestionably
both
pure
and
exalted
but
nothing
can
more
strikingly
show
the
almost
miraculous
energies
of
napoleon
mind
and
his
perfect
than
the
readiness
with
which
in
addition
to
the
cares
of
the
empire
of
france
he
assumed
the
responsibility
of
organizing
and
developing
another
nation
of
five
millions
of
inhabitants
this
was
in
napoleon
was
then
but
years
of
age
to
have
surrendered
those
italians
who
had
rallied
around
the
armies
of
france
in
their
hour
of
need
again
to
austrian
domination
would
have
been
an
act
of
treachery
to
have
abandoned
them
in
their
inexperience
to
the
jacobin
mob
on
the
one
hand
and
to
royalist
intrigues
on
the
other
would
have
insured
the
ruin
of
the
republic
but
by
leaving
the
details
of
government
to
be
administered
by
italians
and
at
the
same
time
sustaining
the
constitution
by
his
own
powerful
hand
there
was
a
probability
that
the
republic
might
attain
prosperity
and
independence
as
the
press
of
business
rendered
it
extremely
difficult
for
napoleon
to
leave
france
a
plan
was
formed
for
a
vast
congress
of
the
italians
to
be
assembled
in
lyons
about
half
way
between
paris
and
milan
for
the
imposing
adoption
of
the
republican
constitution
four
hundred
and
deputies
were
elected
to
cross
the
frozen
alps
in
the
month
of
december
the
extraodinary
watchfulness
and
foresight
of
the
first
consul
had
prepared
every
comfort
for
them
on
the
way
in
lyons
sumptuous
preparations
were
made
for
their
entertainment
magnificent
halls
were
decorated
in
the
highest
style
of
earthly
splendor
for
the
solemnities
of
the
occasion
the
army
of
egypt
which
had
recently
landed
bronzed
by
an
african
sun
was
gorgeously
attired
to
add
to
the
magnificence
of
the
spectacle
the
lyonese
youth
exultant
with
pride
were
formed
into
an
imposing
body
of
cavalry
on
the
of
january
napoleon
accompanied
by
josephine
arrived
in
lyons
the
whole
population
of
the
adjoining
country
had
assembled
along
the
road
anxiously
watching
for
his
passage
at
night
immense
fires
illumined
his
path
blazing
upon
every
hill
side
and
in
every
valley
one
continuous
shout
of
live
bonaparte
rolled
along
with
the
carriage
from
paris
to
lyons
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
napoleon
arrived
in
lyons
the
brilliant
city
flamed
with
the
splendor
of
the
carriage
of
the
first
consul
passed
under
a
triumphal
arch
surmounted
by
a
sleeping
lion
the
emblem
of
france
and
napoleon
took
up
his
residence
in
the
hotel
deville
which
in
most
princely
sumptuousness
had
been
decorated
for
his
reception
the
italians
adored
napoleon
they
felt
personally
ennobled
by
his
renown
for
they
considered
him
their
countryman
the
italian
language
was
his
native
tongue
and
he
spoke
it
with
the
most
perfect
fluency
and
elegance
the
moment
that
the
name
of
napoleon
was
suggested
to
the
deputies
as
president
of
the
republic
it
was
received
with
shouts
of
enthusiastic
acclamation
a
deputation
was
immediately
send
to
the
first
consul
to
express
the
unanimous
and
cordial
wish
of
the
convention
that
he
would
accept
the
office
while
these
things
were
transpiring
napoleon
ever
intensely
occupied
was
inspecting
his
veteran
soldiers
of
italy
and
of
egypt
in
a
public
review
the
elements
seemed
to
conspire
to
invest
the
occasion
with
splendor
the
day
was
cloudless
the
sun
brilliant
the
sky
serene
the
air
invigorating
all
the
inhabitants
of
lyons
and
the
populace
of
the
adjacent
country
thronged
the
streets
no
pen
can
describe
the
transports
with
which
the
hero
was
received
as
he
rode
along
the
lines
of
these
veterans
whom
he
had
so
often
led
to
victory
the
soldiers
shouted
in
a
frenzy
of
enthusiasm
old
men
and
young
men
and
boys
caught
the
shout
and
it
reverberated
along
the
streets
in
one
continuous
roar
matrons
and
maidens
waving
banners
and
handkerchiefs
wept
in
excess
of
emotion
bouquets
of
flowers
were
showered
from
the
windows
to
carpet
his
path
and
every
conceivable
demonstration
was
made
of
the
most
enthusiastic
love
napoleon
himself
was
deeply
moved
by
the
scene
some
of
the
old
grenadiers
whom
he
recognized
he
called
out
of
the
ranks
kindly
talked
with
them
inquiring
respecting
their
wounds
and
their
wants
he
addressed
several
of
the
officers
whom
he
had
seen
in
many
encounters
shook
hands
with
them
and
a
delirium
of
excitement
pervaded
all
minds
upon
his
return
to
the
hotel
deville
he
met
the
deputation
of
the
convention
they
presented
him
the
address
urging
upon
him
the
acceptance
of
the
presidency
of
the
cisalpine
republic
napoleon
received
the
address
intimated
his
acceptance
and
promised
on
the
following
day
to
meet
the
convention
the
next
morning
dawned
brightly
upon
the
city
a
large
church
embellished
with
richest
drapery
was
prepared
for
the
solemnities
of
the
occasion
napoleon
entered
the
church
took
his
seat
upon
an
elevated
platform
surrounded
by
his
family
the
french
ministers
and
a
large
number
of
distinguished
generals
and
statesmen
he
addressed
the
assembly
in
the
italian
language
with
as
much
ease
of
manner
elegance
of
expression
and
fluency
of
utterance
as
if
his
whole
life
had
been
devoted
to
the
cultivation
of
the
powers
of
oratory
he
announced
his
acceptance
of
the
dignity
with
which
they
would
invest
him
and
uttered
his
views
respecting
the
measures
which
he
adopted
to
secure
the
prosperity
of
the
italian
republic
as
the
new
state
was
henceforth
to
be
called
repeated
bursts
of
applause
interrupted
his
address
and
at
its
close
one
continuous
shout
of
acclamation
testified
the
assent
and
the
delight
of
the
assembled
multitude
napoleon
remained
at
lyons
twenty
days
occupied
apparently
every
moment
with
the
vast
affairs
which
then
engrossed
his
attention
and
yet
he
found
time
to
write
daily
to
paris
urging
forward
the
majestic
enterprises
of
the
new
government
in
france
the
following
brief
extracts
from
this
free
and
confidential
correspondence
afford
an
interesting
glimpse
of
the
motives
which
actuated
napoleon
at
this
time
and
of
the
great
objects
of
his
ambition
i
am
proceeding
slowly
in
my
operations
i
pass
the
whole
of
my
mornings
in
giving
audience
to
the
deputations
of
the
neighboring
departments
the
improvement
in
the
happiness
of
france
is
obvious
during
the
past
two
years
the
population
of
lyons
has
increased
more
than
souls
all
the
manufacturers
tell
me
that
their
works
are
in
a
state
of
high
activity
all
minds
seem
to
be
full
of
energy
not
that
energy
which
overturns
empires
but
that
which
them
and
conducts
them
to
prosperity
and
riches
i
beg
of
you
particularly
to
see
that
the
unruly
members
whom
we
have
in
the
constituted
authorities
are
every
one
of
them
removed
the
wish
of
the
nation
is
that
the
government
shall
not
be
obstructed
in
its
endeavors
to
act
for
the
public
good
and
that
the
head
of
medusa
shall
no
longer
show
itself
either
in
our
tribunes
or
in
our
assemblies
the
conduct
of
sieyes
on
this
occasion
completely
proves
that
having
contributed
to
the
destruction
of
all
the
constitutions
since
he
wishes
now
to
try
his
hand
against
the
present
he
ought
to
burn
a
wax
candle
to
our
lady
for
having
got
out
of
the
scrape
so
fortunately
and
in
so
unexpected
a
manner
but
the
older
i
grow
the
more
i
perceive
that
each
man
must
fulfill
his
destiny
i
recommend
you
to
ascertain
whether
the
provisions
for
domingo
have
actually
been
sent
off
i
take
it
for
granted
that
you
have
taken
proper
measures
for
demolishing
the
chatelet
if
the
minister
of
marine
should
stand
in
need
of
the
frigates
of
the
king
of
naples
he
may
make
use
of
them
general
jourdan
gives
me
a
satisfactory
account
of
the
state
of
piedmont
i
wish
that
citizen
royer
be
sent
to
the
military
division
to
examine
into
the
accounts
of
the
paymaster
i
also
wish
some
individual
like
citizen
royer
to
perform
the
same
duty
for
the
and
divisions
it
is
complained
that
the
receivers
keep
the
money
as
long
as
they
can
and
that
the
paymasters
postpone
payment
as
long
as
possible
the
paymasters
and
the
receivers
are
the
greatest
nuisance
in
the
state
yesterday
i
visited
several
factories
i
was
pleased
with
the
industry
and
the
severe
economy
which
pervaded
these
establishments
should
the
wintry
weather
continue
severe
i
do
not
think
that
the
a
month
which
the
minister
of
the
interior
grants
for
the
purposes
of
charity
will
be
sufficient
it
will
be
necessary
to
add
five
thousand
dollars
for
the
distribution
of
wood
and
also
to
light
fires
in
the
churches
and
other
large
buildings
to
give
warmth
to
a
great
number
of
people
napoleon
arrived
in
paris
on
the
of
january
in
the
mean
time
there
had
been
a
new
election
of
members
of
the
tribunate
and
of
the
legislative
body
all
those
who
had
manifested
any
opposition
to
the
measures
of
napoleon
in
the
of
christianity
and
in
the
adoption
of
the
new
civil
code
were
left
out
and
their
places
supplied
by
those
who
approved
of
the
measures
of
the
first
consul
napoleon
could
now
act
unembarrassed
in
every
quarter
there
was
submission
all
the
officers
of
the
state
immediately
upon
his
return
sought
an
audience
and
in
that
pomp
of
language
which
his
majestic
deeds
and
character
inspired
presented
to
him
their
congratulations
he
was
already
a
sovereign
in
possession
of
regal
power
such
as
no
other
monarch
in
europe
enjoyed
upon
one
object
all
the
energies
of
his
mighty
mind
were
concentrated
france
was
his
estate
his
diadem
his
all
the
glory
of
france
was
his
glory
the
happiness
of
france
his
happiness
the
riches
of
france
his
wealth
never
did
a
father
with
more
untiring
and
toil
labor
for
his
family
than
did
napoleon
through
days
of
herculean
exertion
and
nights
of
sleeplessness
devote
every
energy
of
body
and
soul
to
the
greatness
of
france
he
loved
not
ease
he
loved
not
personal
indulgence
he
loved
not
sensual
gratification
the
elevation
of
france
to
prosperity
wealth
and
power
was
a
limitless
ambition
the
almost
supernatural
success
which
had
thus
far
attended
his
exertions
did
but
magnify
his
desires
and
stimulate
his
hopes
he
had
no
wish
to
elevate
france
upon
the
ruins
of
other
nations
but
he
wished
to
make
france
the
pattern
of
all
excellence
the
illustrious
leader
at
the
head
of
all
nations
guiding
them
to
intelligence
to
opulence
and
to
happiness
such
at
this
time
was
the
towering
ambition
of
napoleon
the
most
noble
and
comprehensive
which
was
ever
embraced
by
the
conception
of
man
of
course
such
ambition
was
not
consistent
with
the
equality
of
other
nations
for
he
determined
that
france
should
be
the
first
but
he
manifested
no
disposition
to
destroy
the
prosperity
of
others
he
only
wished
to
give
such
an
impulse
to
humanity
in
france
by
the
culture
of
mind
by
purity
of
morals
by
domestic
industry
by
foreign
commerce
by
great
national
works
as
to
place
france
in
the
advance
upon
the
race
course
of
greatness
in
this
race
france
had
but
one
antagonist
england
france
had
nearly
forty
millions
of
inhabitants
the
island
of
great
britain
contained
but
about
fifteen
millions
but
england
with
her
colonies
girdled
the
globe
and
with
her
fleets
commanded
all
seas
france
said
napoleon
must
also
have
her
colonies
and
her
fleets
if
we
permit
that
the
statesman
of
england
rejoined
we
may
become
a
secondary
power
and
may
thus
be
at
the
mercy
of
france
it
was
undeniably
so
shall
history
be
blind
to
such
fatality
as
this
is
man
in
the
hour
of
triumphant
ambition
so
moderate
that
we
can
be
willing
that
he
should
attain
power
which
places
us
at
his
mercy
england
was
omnipotent
upon
the
seas
she
became
arrogant
and
abused
that
power
and
made
herself
offensive
to
all
nations
napoleon
developed
no
special
meekness
of
character
to
indicate
that
he
would
be
in
the
pride
of
strength
which
no
nation
could
resist
more
moderate
and
conciliating
candor
can
not
censure
england
for
being
unwilling
to
yield
her
high
position
to
surrender
her
supremacy
on
the
seas
to
become
a
secondary
power
to
allow
france
to
become
her
master
and
who
can
censure
france
for
seeking
the
establishment
of
colonies
the
extension
of
commerce
friendly
alliance
with
other
nations
and
the
creation
of
fleets
to
protect
her
from
aggression
upon
the
ocean
as
well
as
upon
the
land
napoleon
himself
with
that
wonderful
magnanimity
which
ever
characterized
him
though
at
times
exasperated
by
the
hostility
which
he
now
encountered
yet
often
spoke
in
terms
of
respect
of
the
influences
which
animated
his
foes
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
his
antagonists
so
seldom
reciprocated
this
magnanimity
there
was
here
most
certainly
a
right
and
a
wrong
but
it
is
not
easy
for
man
accurately
to
adjust
the
balance
god
alone
can
award
the
issue
the
mind
is
saddened
as
it
wanders
amid
the
labyrinths
of
conscientiousness
and
of
passion
of
pure
motives
and
impure
ambition
this
is
indeed
a
fallen
world
the
drama
of
nations
is
a
tragedy
melancholy
is
the
lot
of
man
england
daily
witnessed
with
increasing
alarm
the
rapid
and
enormous
strides
which
france
was
making
the
energy
of
the
first
consul
seemed
superhuman
his
acts
indicated
the
most
profound
sagacity
the
most
foresight
the
news
reaches
london
that
napoleon
has
been
elected
president
of
the
italian
republic
thus
in
an
hour
five
millions
of
people
are
added
to
his
empire
it
is
announced
that
he
is
establishing
a
colony
at
elba
that
a
vast
expedition
is
sailing
for
domingo
to
the
colony
there
england
is
bewildered
again
it
is
proclaimed
that
napoleon
has
purchased
louisiana
of
spain
and
is
preparing
to
fill
the
fertile
valley
of
the
mississippi
with
colonists
in
the
mean
time
all
france
is
in
a
state
of
activity
factories
roads
bridges
canals
fortifications
are
every
where
springing
into
existence
the
sound
of
the
ship
hammer
reverberates
in
all
the
harbors
of
france
and
every
month
witnesses
the
increase
of
the
french
fleet
the
mass
of
the
english
people
contemplate
with
admiration
this
development
of
energy
the
statesmen
of
england
contemplate
it
with
dread
for
some
months
napoleon
in
the
midst
of
all
his
other
cares
had
been
maturing
a
vast
system
of
public
instruction
for
the
youth
of
france
he
drew
up
with
his
own
hand
the
plan
for
their
schools
and
proposed
the
course
of
study
it
is
a
little
singular
that
with
his
strong
scientific
predilections
he
should
have
assigned
the
first
rank
to
classical
studies
perhaps
this
is
to
be
accounted
for
from
his
profound
admiration
of
the
heroes
of
antiquity
his
own
mind
was
most
thoroughly
stored
with
all
the
treasures
of
greek
and
roman
story
all
these
schools
were
formed
upon
a
military
model
for
situated
as
france
was
in
the
midst
of
monarchies
at
heart
hostile
he
deemed
it
necessary
that
the
nation
should
be
universally
trained
to
bear
arms
religious
instruction
was
to
be
communicated
in
all
these
schools
by
chaplains
military
instruction
by
old
officers
who
had
left
the
army
and
classical
and
scientific
instruction
by
the
most
learned
men
europe
could
furnish
the
first
consul
also
devoted
special
attention
to
female
schools
france
needs
nothing
so
much
to
promote
her
regeneration
said
he
as
good
mothers
to
attract
the
youth
of
france
to
these
schools
one
millions
of
dollars
was
appropriated
for
over
six
thousand
gratuitous
exhibitions
for
the
pupils
ten
schools
of
law
were
established
nine
schools
of
medicine
and
an
institution
for
the
mechanical
arts
called
the
school
of
bridges
and
roads
the
first
model
of
those
schools
of
art
which
continue
in
france
until
the
present
day
and
which
are
deemed
invaluable
there
were
no
exclusive
privileges
in
these
institutions
a
system
of
perfect
equality
pervaded
them
the
pupils
of
all
classes
were
placed
upon
a
level
with
an
unobstructed
arena
before
them
this
is
only
a
commencement
said
napoleon
we
shall
do
more
and
better
another
project
which
napoleon
now
introduced
was
vehemently
opposed
the
establishment
of
the
legion
of
honor
one
of
the
leading
principles
of
the
revolution
was
the
entire
overthrow
of
all
titles
of
distinction
every
man
high
or
low
was
to
be
addressed
simply
as
citizen
napoleon
wished
to
introduce
a
system
of
rewards
which
should
stimulate
to
heroic
deeds
and
which
should
ennoble
those
who
had
deserved
well
of
humanity
innumerable
foreigners
of
distinction
had
thronged
france
since
the
peace
he
had
observed
with
what
eagerness
the
populace
had
followed
these
foreigners
gazing
with
delight
upon
their
gay
decorations
the
of
the
tuileries
was
ever
crowded
when
these
illustrious
strangers
arrived
and
departed
napoleon
in
his
council
where
he
was
always
eloquent
and
powerful
thus
urged
his
views
look
at
these
vanities
which
genius
pretends
so
much
to
disdain
the
populace
is
not
of
that
opinion
it
loves
these
ribbons
as
it
loves
religious
pomp
the
democrat
philosopher
calls
it
vanity
vanity
let
it
be
but
that
vanity
is
a
weakness
common
to
the
whole
human
race
and
great
virtues
may
be
made
to
spring
from
it
with
these
so
much
despised
baubles
heroes
are
made
there
must
be
worship
for
the
religious
sentiment
there
must
be
visible
distinctions
for
the
noble
sentiment
of
glory
nations
should
not
strive
to
be
singular
any
more
than
individuals
the
affectation
of
acting
differently
from
the
rest
of
the
world
is
an
affectation
which
is
reproved
by
all
persons
of
sense
and
modesty
ribbons
are
in
use
in
all
countries
let
them
be
in
use
in
france
it
will
be
one
more
friendly
relation
established
with
europe
our
neighbors
give
them
only
to
the
man
of
noble
birth
i
will
give
them
to
the
man
of
merit
to
the
one
who
shall
have
served
best
in
the
army
or
in
the
state
or
who
shall
have
produced
the
finest
works
it
was
objected
that
the
institution
of
the
legion
of
honor
was
a
return
to
the
aristocracy
which
the
revolution
had
abolished
what
is
there
aristocratic
napoleon
exclaimed
in
a
distinction
purely
personal
and
merely
for
life
bestowed
on
the
man
who
has
displayed
merit
whether
evil
or
military
bestowed
on
him
alone
bestowed
for
his
life
only
and
not
passing
to
his
children
such
a
distinction
is
the
reverse
of
aristocratic
it
is
the
essence
of
aristocracy
that
its
titles
are
transmitted
from
the
man
who
has
earned
them
to
the
son
who
possesses
no
merit
the
ancient
regime
so
battered
by
the
ram
revolution
is
more
entire
than
is
believed
all
the
emigrants
hold
each
other
by
the
hand
the
vendeeans
are
secretly
enrolled
the
priests
at
heart
are
not
very
friendly
to
us
with
the
words
king
thousands
might
be
roused
to
arms
it
is
needful
that
the
men
who
have
taken
part
in
the
revolution
should
have
a
bond
of
union
and
cease
to
depend
on
the
first
accident
which
might
strike
one
single
head
for
ten
years
we
have
only
been
making
ruins
we
must
now
found
an
edifice
depend
upon
it
the
struggle
is
not
over
with
europe
be
assured
that
struggle
will
begin
again
it
was
then
urged
by
some
that
the
legion
of
honor
should
be
confined
entirely
to
military
merit
by
no
means
said
napoleon
rewards
are
not
to
be
conferred
upon
soldiers
alone
all
sorts
of
merit
are
brothers
the
courage
of
the
president
of
the
convention
resisting
the
populace
should
compared
with
the
courage
of
kleber
mounting
to
the
assault
of
acre
it
is
right
that
civil
virtues
should
have
their
reward
as
well
as
military
virtues
those
who
oppose
this
course
reason
like
barbarians
it
is
the
religion
of
brute
force
they
commend
to
us
intelligence
has
its
rights
before
those
of
force
force
without
intelligence
is
nothing
in
barbarous
ages
the
man
of
stoutest
sinews
was
the
chieftain
now
the
general
is
the
most
intelligent
of
the
brave
at
cairo
the
egyptians
could
not
comprehend
how
it
was
that
kleber
with
his
majestic
form
was
not
when
mourad
bey
had
carefully
observed
our
tactics
he
could
comprehend
how
it
was
that
i
and
no
other
ought
to
be
the
general
of
an
army
so
conducted
you
reason
like
the
egyptians
when
you
attempt
to
confine
rewards
to
military
valor
the
soldiers
reason
better
than
you
go
to
their
bivouacs
listen
to
them
do
you
imagine
that
it
is
the
tallest
of
their
officers
and
the
most
imposing
by
his
stature
for
whom
they
feel
the
highest
regard
do
you
imagine
even
that
the
bravest
stands
first
in
their
esteem
no
doubt
they
would
despise
the
man
whose
courage
they
suspected
but
they
rank
above
the
merely
brave
man
him
who
they
consider
the
most
intelligent
as
for
myself
do
you
suppose
that
it
is
solely
because
i
am
reputed
a
great
general
that
i
rule
france
no
it
is
because
the
qualities
of
a
statesman
and
a
magistrate
are
attributed
to
me
france
will
never
tolerate
the
government
of
the
sword
those
who
think
so
are
strangely
mistaken
it
would
require
an
abject
servitude
of
fifty
years
before
that
could
be
the
case
france
is
too
noble
too
intelligent
a
country
to
submit
to
material
power
let
us
honor
intelligence
virtue
the
civil
qualities
in
short
let
us
bestow
upon
them
in
all
profession
the
like
reward
the
true
spirit
of
republicanism
is
certainly
equality
of
rights
not
of
attainments
and
honors
the
abolition
of
hereditary
distinctions
and
privileges
not
of
those
which
are
founded
upon
merit
the
badge
of
the
legion
of
honor
was
to
be
conferred
upon
all
who
by
genius
and
toil
had
won
renown
the
prizes
were
open
to
the
humblest
peasant
in
the
land
still
the
popular
hostility
to
any
institution
which
bore
a
resemblance
to
the
aristocracy
of
the
ancient
nobility
was
so
strong
that
though
a
majority
voted
in
favor
of
the
measure
there
was
a
strong
opposition
napoleon
was
surprised
he
said
to
bourrienne
you
are
right
prejudices
are
still
against
me
i
ought
to
have
waited
there
was
no
occasion
for
haste
in
bringing
it
forward
but
the
thing
is
done
and
you
will
soon
find
that
the
taste
for
these
distinctions
is
not
yet
gone
by
it
is
a
taste
which
belongs
to
the
nature
of
man
you
will
see
that
extraordinary
results
will
arise
from
it
the
order
was
consist
of
six
thousand
members
it
was
constituted
in
four
ranks
grand
officers
commanders
officers
and
private
legionaries
the
badge
was
simply
a
red
ribbon
in
the
to
the
first
rank
there
was
allotted
an
annual
salary
of
to
the
second
to
the
third
to
the
fourth
the
private
soldier
the
retired
scholar
and
the
skillful
artist
were
thus
decorated
with
the
same
badge
of
distinction
which
figured
upon
the
breast
of
generals
nobles
and
monarchs
that
this
institution
was
peculiarly
adapted
to
the
state
of
france
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
it
has
survived
all
the
revolutions
of
subsequent
years
though
of
such
recent
origin
says
theirs
it
is
already
consecrated
as
if
it
had
passed
through
centuries
to
such
a
degree
has
it
become
the
recompense
of
heroism
of
knowledge
of
merit
of
every
kind
so
much
have
its
honors
been
coveted
by
the
grandees
and
the
princes
of
europe
the
most
proud
of
their
origin
the
popularity
of
napoleon
was
now
unbounded
a
very
general
and
earnest
disposition
was
expressed
to
confer
upon
the
first
consul
a
magnificent
testimonial
of
the
national
gratitude
a
testimonial
worthy
of
the
illustrious
man
who
was
to
receive
it
and
of
the
powerful
nation
by
which
it
was
to
be
bestowed
the
president
of
the
tribunal
thus
addressed
that
body
among
all
nations
public
honors
have
been
decreed
to
men
who
by
splendid
actions
have
honored
their
country
and
saved
it
from
great
dangers
what
man
ever
had
stronger
claims
to
the
national
gratitude
than
general
bonaparte
his
valor
and
genius
have
saved
the
french
people
from
the
excesses
of
anarchy
and
from
the
miseries
of
war
and
france
is
too
great
too
magnanimous
to
leave
such
benefits
without
reward
a
deputation
was
immediately
chosen
to
confer
with
napoleon
upon
the
subject
of
the
tribute
of
gratitude
and
affection
which
he
should
receive
surrounded
by
his
colleagues
and
the
principal
officers
of
the
state
he
received
them
the
next
day
in
the
tuileries
with
seriousness
and
modesty
he
listened
to
the
high
eulogium
upon
his
achievements
which
was
pronounced
and
then
replaced
i
receive
with
sincere
gratitude
the
wish
to
expressed
by
the
tribunate
i
desire
no
other
glory
than
having
completely
performed
the
task
impose
upon
me
i
aspire
to
no
other
reward
than
the
affection
of
my
i
shall
be
happy
if
they
are
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
evils
which
they
may
experience
will
always
be
to
me
the
severest
of
misfortunes
that
life
is
dear
to
me
solely
for
the
services
which
i
am
to
render
to
my
country
that
death
itself
will
have
no
bitterness
for
me
if
my
last
looks
can
see
the
happiness
of
the
republic
as
firmly
secured
as
is
its
glory
but
how
was
napoleon
to
be
rewarded
that
was
the
great
difficult
question
was
wealth
to
be
conferred
upon
him
for
wealth
he
cared
nothing
millions
had
been
at
his
disposal
and
he
had
emptied
them
all
into
the
treasury
of
france
ease
luxury
had
no
charms
for
him
were
monuments
to
be
reared
to
his
honor
titles
to
be
lavished
upon
his
name
napoleon
regarded
these
but
means
for
the
accomplishment
of
ends
in
themselves
they
were
nothing
the
one
only
thing
which
he
desired
was
power
power
to
work
out
vast
results
for
others
and
thus
to
secure
for
himself
renown
which
should
be
pure
and
imperishable
but
how
could
the
power
of
napoleon
be
increased
he
was
already
almost
absolute
whatever
he
willed
he
accomplished
senators
legislators
and
tribunes
all
in
giving
energy
to
his
plans
it
will
be
remembered
that
napoleon
was
elected
first
consul
for
a
period
of
ten
years
it
seemed
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
which
could
be
done
gratifying
to
the
first
consul
but
to
prolong
the
term
of
his
consulship
by
either
adding
to
it
another
period
of
ten
years
or
by
continuing
it
during
his
life
what
does
he
wish
was
the
universal
inquiry
every
possible
means
were
tried
but
in
vain
to
obtain
a
single
word
from
his
lips
significant
of
his
desires
one
of
the
senators
went
to
cambaceres
and
said
what
would
be
gratifying
to
general
bonaparte
does
he
wish
to
be
king
only
let
him
say
so
and
we
are
all
ready
to
vote
for
the
of
royalty
most
willingly
will
we
do
it
for
him
for
he
is
worthy
of
that
station
but
the
first
consul
shut
himself
up
in
impenetrable
reserve
even
his
most
intimate
friends
could
catch
no
glimpse
of
his
secret
wishes
at
last
the
question
was
plainly
and
earnestly
put
to
him
with
great
apparent
humility
he
replied
i
have
not
fixed
my
mind
upon
any
thing
any
testimony
of
the
public
confidence
will
be
sufficient
for
me
and
will
fill
me
with
satisfaction
the
question
was
then
discussed
whether
to
add
ten
years
to
his
consulship
or
to
make
him
first
consul
for
life
cambaceres
knew
well
the
boundless
ambition
of
napoleon
and
was
fully
conscious
that
any
limited
period
of
power
would
not
be
in
accordance
with
his
plans
he
ventured
to
say
to
him
you
are
wrong
not
to
explain
yourself
your
enemies
for
notwithstanding
your
services
you
have
some
left
even
in
the
senate
will
abuse
your
reserve
napoleon
calmly
replied
let
them
alone
the
majority
of
the
senate
is
always
ready
to
do
more
than
it
is
asked
they
will
go
further
than
you
imagine
on
the
evening
of
the
of
may
the
resolution
was
adopted
of
prolonging
the
powers
of
the
first
consul
for
ten
years
napoleon
was
probably
surprised
and
disappointed
he
however
decided
to
return
a
grateful
answer
and
to
say
that
from
the
senate
but
from
the
suffrages
of
the
people
alone
could
he
accept
a
prolongation
of
that
power
to
which
their
voices
had
elevated
him
the
following
answer
was
transmitted
to
the
senate
the
next
morning
the
honorable
proof
of
your
esteem
given
in
your
deliberation
of
the
will
remain
forever
engraven
on
my
heart
in
the
three
years
which
have
just
elapsed
fortune
has
smiled
upon
the
republic
but
fortune
is
fickle
how
many
men
whom
she
has
loaded
with
favors
have
lived
a
few
years
too
long
the
interest
of
my
glory
and
that
of
my
happiness
would
seem
to
have
marked
the
term
of
my
public
life
at
the
moment
when
the
peace
of
the
world
is
proclaimed
but
the
glory
and
the
happiness
of
the
citizen
ought
to
be
silent
when
the
interest
of
the
state
and
the
public
partiality
call
him
you
judge
that
i
owe
a
new
sacrifice
to
the
people
i
will
make
it
if
the
wishes
of
the
people
command
what
your
suffrage
authorizes
napoleon
immediately
left
paris
for
his
at
malmaison
this
beautiful
chateau
was
about
ten
miles
from
the
metropolis
josephine
had
purchased
the
peaceful
rural
retreat
at
request
during
his
first
italian
campaign
subsequently
large
sums
had
been
expended
in
enlarging
and
improving
the
grounds
and
it
was
ever
the
favorite
the
grounds
and
it
was
ever
the
favorite
residence
of
both
josephine
and
napoleon
cambacres
called
an
extraordinary
meeting
of
the
council
of
state
after
much
deliberation
it
was
resolved
by
an
immense
majority
that
the
following
preposition
should
be
submitted
to
the
people
shall
napoleon
bonaparte
be
the
first
consul
for
life
it
was
then
resolved
to
submit
a
second
question
shall
the
first
consul
have
the
power
of
appointing
his
successor
this
was
indeed
monarchy
under
a
republican
name
cambaceres
immediately
repaired
to
malmaison
to
submit
these
resolutions
to
napoleon
to
the
amazement
of
all
he
immediately
and
firmly
rejected
the
second
question
energetically
he
said
whom
would
you
have
me
appoint
my
successor
on
brothers
but
will
france
which
has
consented
to
be
governed
by
joseph
or
lucien
shall
i
nominate
you
consul
cambceres
you
dare
you
undertake
such
a
task
and
then
the
will
of
louis
xiv
was
not
respected
it
is
likely
that
mine
would
be
a
dead
man
let
him
be
who
he
will
is
nobody
in
opposition
to
all
urgency
he
ordered
the
second
question
to
be
erased
and
the
first
only
to
be
submitted
to
the
people
it
is
impossible
to
divine
the
motive
which
influenced
napoleon
in
the
most
unexpected
decision
some
have
supposed
that
even
then
he
had
in
view
the
empire
and
the
hereditary
monarchy
and
that
he
wished
to
leave
a
chasm
in
the
organization
of
the
government
as
a
reason
for
future
change
others
have
supposed
that
he
dreaded
the
rivalries
which
would
arise
among
his
brothers
and
his
nephews
from
his
having
his
disposal
so
resplendent
a
gift
as
the
empire
of
france
but
the
historian
treads
upon
dangerous
ground
when
he
begins
to
judge
of
motives
that
which
napoleon
actually
did
was
moderate
and
noble
in
the
highest
degree
he
declined
the
power
of
appointing
his
successor
and
submitted
his
election
to
the
suffrages
of
the
people
a
majority
of
voted
for
the
consulate
for
life
and
only
eight
thousands
and
a
few
hundreds
against
it
never
before
or
since
was
an
early
government
established
by
such
unamitity
never
had
a
monarch
a
more
indisputable
title
to
his
throne
upon
this
occasion
lafayette
added
to
his
vote
these
or
qualifying
words
i
can
not
vote
for
such
a
magistracy
until
public
freed
sufficiently
guarantied
when
that
is
done
i
give
my
voice
to
napoleon
bonaparte
in
a
private
conversation
with
the
first
consul
he
added
a
free
government
and
you
at
its
comprehends
all
my
desires
napoleon
remarked
in
theory
lafayette
is
perhaps
right
but
what
is
theory
a
mere
dream
when
applied
to
the
masses
of
mankind
he
think
he
is
still
in
the
united
states
as
if
the
french
were
americans
he
has
no
conception
of
what
is
required
for
this
country
a
day
was
fixed
for
a
grand
diplomatic
festival
when
napoleon
should
receive
the
congratulations
of
the
constituted
authorities
and
of
the
foreign
embassadors
the
soldiers
in
brilliant
uniform
formed
a
double
line
from
the
tuileries
to
the
luxembourg
the
first
consul
was
seated
in
a
magnificent
chariot
drawn
by
eight
horses
a
cortege
of
gorgeous
splendor
accompanied
him
all
paris
thronged
the
streets
through
which
he
passed
and
the
most
enthusiastic
applause
rent
the
heavens
to
the
congratulatory
address
of
the
senate
napoleon
replied
the
life
of
a
citizen
belongs
to
his
country
the
french
nation
wishes
that
mine
should
be
wholly
consecrated
to
france
i
obey
its
will
through
my
efforts
by
your
assistance
by
the
aid
of
the
authorities
and
by
the
confidence
and
support
of
this
mighty
people
the
liberty
equality
and
prosperity
of
france
will
be
rendered
secure
against
the
caprices
of
fate
and
the
uncertainty
of
futurity
the
most
virtuous
of
nations
will
be
the
most
happy
as
it
deserves
to
be
and
its
felicity
will
contribute
to
the
general
happiness
of
all
europe
proud
then
of
being
thus
called
by
the
command
of
that
power
from
which
every
thing
emanates
to
bring
back
order
justice
and
equality
to
the
earth
when
my
last
hour
approaches
i
shall
yield
myself
up
with
resignation
and
without
any
solicitude
respecting
the
opinions
of
future
generations
on
the
following
day
the
new
articles
modifying
the
constitution
in
accordance
with
the
change
in
the
consulship
were
submitted
to
the
council
of
state
the
first
consul
presided
and
with
his
accustomed
vigor
and
perspicuity
explained
the
reasons
of
each
article
as
he
recounted
them
one
by
one
the
articles
contained
the
provision
that
napoleon
should
nominate
his
successor
to
the
senate
to
this
after
a
slight
resistance
he
yielded
the
most
profound
satisfaction
now
pervaded
france
even
josephine
began
to
be
tranquil
and
happy
she
imagined
that
all
thoughts
of
royalty
and
of
hereditary
succession
had
now
passed
away
she
contemplated
with
no
uneasiness
the
power
which
napoleon
sympathized
cordially
with
her
in
her
high
gratification
that
hortense
was
soon
to
become
a
mother
this
child
was
already
in
their
hearts
the
selected
heir
to
the
power
of
napoleon
on
the
of
august
paris
magnificiently
celebrated
the
anniversary
of
the
of
the
first
consul
this
was
another
introduction
of
monarchical
usages
all
the
high
authorities
of
the
church
and
the
state
and
the
foreign
diplomatic
bodies
called
upon
him
with
congratulations
at
noon
in
all
the
churches
of
the
metropolis
a
te
deun
was
sung
in
gratitude
to
god
for
the
gift
of
napoleon
at
night
the
city
blazed
with
illuminations
the
splendors
and
the
etiquette
of
royalty
were
now
rapidly
introduced
and
the
same
fickle
populace
who
had
so
recently
trampled
princes
and
thrones
into
blood
and
ruin
were
now
captivated
with
of
these
discarded
splendors
napoleon
soon
established
himself
in
the
beautiful
chateau
of
st
cloud
which
he
has
caused
to
be
repaired
with
great
magnificence
on
the
sabbath
the
first
consul
with
josephine
invariably
attended
divine
service
their
example
was
soon
followed
by
most
of
the
members
of
the
court
and
the
nation
as
a
body
returned
to
christianity
which
even
in
its
most
corrupt
form
saves
humanity
from
those
abysses
of
degradation
into
which
infidelity
plunges
it
immediately
after
divine
service
he
conversed
in
the
gallery
of
the
chateau
with
the
visitors
who
were
then
waiting
for
him
the
brilliance
of
his
intellect
and
his
high
renown
caused
him
to
be
approached
with
emotions
of
awe
his
words
were
listened
to
with
intensest
eagerness
he
was
the
exclusive
object
of
observation
and
attention
no
earthly
potentate
had
ever
attained
such
a
degree
of
homage
pure
and
sincere
as
now
circled
around
the
first
consul
napoleon
was
very
desirous
of
having
his
court
a
model
of
decorum
and
of
morals
lucien
owned
a
beautiful
rural
mansion
near
neuilly
upon
one
occasion
he
invited
napoleon
and
all
the
inmates
of
malmaison
to
attend
some
private
theatricals
at
his
dwelling
lucien
and
eliza
were
the
performers
in
a
piece
called
alzire
the
ardor
of
their
declamation
the
freedom
of
their
gestures
and
above
all
the
indelicacy
of
the
costume
which
they
assumed
displeased
napoleon
exceedingly
as
soon
as
the
play
was
over
he
exclaimed
it
is
a
scandal
i
ought
not
to
suffer
such
indecencies
i
will
give
lucien
to
understand
that
i
will
have
no
more
of
it
as
soon
as
lucien
entered
the
saloon
having
resumed
his
usual
dress
napoleon
addressed
him
before
the
whole
company
and
requested
him
in
future
to
desist
from
all
such
representations
what
said
he
when
i
am
endeavoring
to
restore
purity
of
manners
my
brother
and
sister
must
needs
exhibit
themselves
upon
a
platform
almost
in
a
state
of
nudity
it
is
an
insult
one
day
at
this
time
bourrienne
going
from
malmaison
to
ruel
lost
a
beautiful
watch
he
proclaimed
his
loss
by
means
of
the
bellman
at
ruel
an
hour
after
as
he
was
sitting
down
to
dinner
a
peasant
boy
brought
him
the
watch
which
he
had
found
on
the
road
napoleon
heard
of
the
occurrence
immediately
he
instituted
inquiries
respecting
the
young
man
and
the
family
hearing
a
good
report
of
them
he
gave
the
three
brothers
employment
and
amply
rewarded
the
honest
lad
kindness
says
bourrienne
was
a
very
prominent
trait
in
the
character
of
napoleon
if
we
now
take
a
brief
review
of
what
napoleon
had
accomplished
since
his
return
from
egypt
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
records
of
the
world
are
to
be
searched
in
vain
for
a
similar
recital
no
mortal
man
before
ever
accomplished
so
much
or
accomplished
it
so
well
in
so
short
a
time
let
us
for
a
moment
return
to
his
landing
at
frejus
on
the
of
october
until
he
was
chosen
first
consul
for
life
in
august
a
period
of
not
quite
three
years
proceeding
to
paris
almost
alone
he
overthrew
the
directory
and
seized
the
supreme
power
restored
order
into
the
administration
of
government
established
a
new
and
very
efficient
system
for
the
collection
of
taxes
raised
public
credit
and
supplied
the
wants
of
the
suffering
army
by
great
energy
and
humanity
he
immediately
terminated
the
horrors
of
that
unnatural
war
which
had
for
years
been
desolating
la
vendee
condescending
to
the
attitude
of
suppliant
he
implored
of
europe
peace
europe
chose
war
by
a
majestic
conception
of
military
combinations
he
sent
moreau
with
a
vast
army
to
the
rhime
stimulated
massena
to
the
most
desperate
strife
at
genoa
and
then
creating
as
by
magic
an
army
from
materials
which
excited
but
the
ridicule
of
his
foes
he
climbed
with
artillery
and
horse
and
all
the
munitions
of
war
the
icy
pinnacles
of
the
alps
and
fell
like
an
avalanche
upon
his
foes
upon
the
plain
of
marengo
with
far
inferior
numbers
he
snatched
the
victory
from
the
victors
and
in
the
exultant
hour
of
the
most
signal
conquest
wrote
again
from
the
field
of
blood
imploring
peace
his
foes
humbled
and
at
his
mercy
gladly
availed
themselves
of
his
clemency
and
promised
to
treat
perfidiously
they
only
sought
time
to
regain
their
strength
he
then
sent
moreau
to
hohenlinden
and
beneath
the
walls
of
vienna
extorted
peace
with
continental
europe
england
still
prosecuted
the
war
the
first
consul
by
his
genius
won
the
heart
of
paul
of
russia
secured
the
affection
of
prussia
denmark
and
sweden
and
formed
a
league
of
all
europe
against
the
mistress
of
the
seas
while
engaged
in
this
work
he
paid
the
creditors
of
the
state
established
the
bank
of
france
overwhelmed
the
highway
robbers
with
utter
destruction
and
restored
security
in
all
the
provinces
cut
magnificent
communications
over
the
alps
founded
hospitals
on
their
summits
surrounded
exposed
cities
with
fortifications
opened
canals
constructed
bridges
created
magnificent
roads
and
commenced
the
compiliation
of
that
civil
code
which
will
remain
an
monument
of
his
labors
and
his
genius
in
opposition
to
the
remonstrances
of
his
best
friends
he
christianity
and
with
it
proclaimed
perfect
liberty
of
conscience
public
works
were
every
where
established
to
encourage
industry
schools
and
colleges
were
founded
merit
of
every
kind
was
stimulated
by
abundant
rewards
vast
improvements
were
made
in
paris
and
the
streets
cleaned
and
irrigated
in
the
midst
of
all
these
cares
he
was
defending
france
against
the
assaults
of
the
most
powerful
nation
on
the
globe
and
he
was
preparing
as
his
last
resort
a
vast
army
to
carry
the
war
into
the
heart
of
england
notwithstanding
the
most
atrocious
libels
with
which
england
was
filled
against
him
his
fame
shone
resplendent
through
them
all
and
he
was
popular
with
the
english
people
many
of
the
most
illustrious
of
the
english
statesmen
advocated
his
cause
his
gigantic
adversary
william
pitt
vanquished
by
the
genius
of
napoleon
was
compelled
to
retire
from
the
ministry
and
the
world
was
at
peace
the
difficulties
perplexities
embarrassments
which
were
encountered
in
those
enterprises
were
infinite
says
napoleon
with
that
magnanimity
which
history
should
recognize
and
applaud
we
are
told
that
all
the
first
consul
has
to
look
to
was
to
do
justice
but
to
whom
was
he
to
do
justice
to
the
proprietors
whom
the
revolution
had
violently
despoiled
of
their
properties
for
this
only
that
they
had
been
faithful
to
their
legitimate
sovereign
to
the
principle
of
honor
which
they
had
inherited
from
their
ancestors
or
to
those
new
proprietors
who
had
purchased
these
domains
adventuring
their
money
on
the
faith
of
laws
flowing
from
an
illegitimate
authority
was
he
to
do
justice
to
those
royalist
soldiers
mutilated
in
the
fields
of
germany
la
vendee
and
quiberon
arrayed
under
the
white
standard
of
the
bourbons
in
the
firm
belief
that
they
were
serving
the
cause
of
their
king
against
a
usurping
tyranny
or
to
the
million
of
citizens
who
forming
around
the
frontiers
a
wall
of
brass
had
so
often
saved
their
country
from
the
inveterate
hostility
of
its
enemies
and
had
borne
to
so
transcendent
a
height
the
glory
of
the
french
eagle
was
he
to
do
justice
to
that
clergy
the
model
and
the
example
of
every
christian
virtue
stripped
of
its
birthright
the
reward
of
fifteen
hundred
years
of
benevolence
or
to
the
recent
acquires
who
had
converted
the
convents
into
workshops
the
churches
into
warehouses
and
had
turned
to
profane
uses
all
that
had
been
deemed
most
holy
for
ages
at
this
period
says
theirs
napoleon
appeared
so
moderate
after
having
been
so
victorious
he
showed
himself
so
profound
a
legislator
after
having
proved
himself
so
great
a
commander
he
evinced
so
much
love
for
the
arts
of
peace
after
having
excelled
in
the
arts
of
war
that
well
might
he
excite
illusions
in
france
and
in
the
world
only
some
few
among
the
parsonages
who
were
admitted
to
his
councils
who
were
capable
of
judging
futurity
by
the
present
were
filled
with
as
much
anxiety
as
admiration
on
witnessing
the
indefatigable
activity
of
his
mind
and
body
and
the
energy
of
his
will
and
the
impetuosity
of
his
desires
they
trembled
even
at
seeing
him
do
good
in
the
way
he
did
so
impatient
was
he
to
accomplish
it
quickly
and
upon
an
immense
scale
the
wise
and
sagacious
tronchet
who
both
admired
and
loved
him
and
looked
upon
him
as
the
savior
of
france
said
nevertheless
one
day
in
a
tone
of
deep
feeling
to
cambracers
young
man
begins
like
caesar
i
fear
that
he
will
end
like
the
elevation
of
napoleon
to
the
supreme
power
for
life
was
regarded
by
most
of
the
states
of
continental
europe
with
satisfaction
as
tending
to
diminish
the
dreaded
influences
of
republicanism
and
to
assimilate
france
with
the
surrounding
monarchies
even
in
england
the
prime
minister
addington
assured
the
french
embassador
of
the
cordial
approbation
of
the
british
government
of
an
event
destined
to
consolidate
order
and
power
in
france
the
king
of
prussia
the
emperor
alexander
and
the
archduke
charles
of
austria
sent
him
their
friendly
congratulations
even
catharine
the
haughty
queen
of
naples
mother
of
the
empress
of
austria
being
then
at
vienna
in
ardent
expression
of
her
gratification
to
the
french
embassador
said
general
bonaparte
is
a
great
man
he
has
done
me
much
injury
but
that
shall
not
prevent
me
from
acknowledging
his
genius
by
checking
disorder
in
france
he
has
rendered
a
service
to
all
of
europe
he
has
attained
the
government
of
his
country
because
he
is
most
worthy
of
it
i
hold
him
out
every
day
as
a
pattern
to
the
young
princes
of
the
imperial
family
i
exhort
them
to
study
that
extraordinary
personage
to
learn
from
him
how
to
direct
nations
how
to
make
the
yoke
of
authority
endurable
by
means
of
genius
and
glory
but
difficulties
were
rapidly
rising
between
england
and
france
the
english
were
much
disappointed
in
not
finding
that
sale
of
their
manufactures
which
they
had
anticipated
the
cotton
and
iron
manufactures
were
the
richest
branches
of
industry
in
england
napoleon
supremely
devoted
to
the
development
of
the
manufacturing
resources
of
france
encouraged
those
manufactures
by
the
almost
absolute
prohibition
of
the
rival
articles
william
pitt
and
his
partisans
still
retaining
immense
influence
regarded
with
extreme
jealousy
the
rapid
strides
which
napoleon
was
making
to
power
and
incessantly
declaimed
in
the
journals
against
the
ambition
of
france
most
of
the
royalist
emigrants
who
had
refused
to
acknowledge
the
new
government
and
were
still
devoted
to
the
cause
of
the
bourbons
had
taken
refuge
in
london
they
had
been
the
allies
with
england
in
the
long
war
against
france
the
english
government
could
not
refrain
from
sympathizing
with
them
in
their
sufferings
it
would
have
been
ungenerous
not
to
have
done
so
the
emigrants
were
many
of
them
supported
by
pensions
paid
them
by
england
at
the
same
time
they
were
constantly
plotting
conspiracies
against
the
life
of
napoleon
and
sending
assassins
to
shoot
him
i
will
yet
teach
those
bourbons
that
i
am
not
a
man
to
be
shot
at
like
a
dog
napoleon
complained
bitterly
that
his
enemies
then
attempting
his
assassination
were
in
the
pay
of
the
british
government
almost
daily
the
plots
of
these
emigrants
were
brought
to
light
by
the
vigilance
of
the
french
police
a
bourbon
pamphleteer
named
peltier
circulated
widely
through
england
the
most
atrocious
libels
against
the
first
consul
his
wife
her
children
his
brothers
and
sisters
they
were
charged
with
the
most
low
degrading
and
revolting
vices
these
accusations
were
circulated
widely
through
england
and
america
they
produced
a
profound
impression
they
were
believed
many
were
interested
in
the
circulation
of
these
reports
wishing
to
destroy
the
popularity
of
napoleon
and
to
prepare
the
populace
of
england
for
the
renewal
of
the
war
napoleon
remonstrated
against
such
infamous
representations
of
his
character
being
allowed
in
england
but
he
was
informed
that
the
british
press
was
free
that
there
was
no
resource
but
to
prosecute
for
libel
in
the
british
courts
and
that
it
was
the
part
of
true
greatness
to
treat
such
slanders
with
contempt
but
napoleon
felt
that
such
false
charges
were
exasperating
nations
were
paving
the
way
to
deluge
europe
again
in
war
and
that
causes
tending
to
such
woes
were
too
potent
to
be
despised
the
algerines
were
now
sweeping
with
their
paretic
crafts
the
mediterranean
exacting
tribute
from
all
christian
powers
a
french
ship
had
been
wrecked
upon
the
coast
and
the
crew
were
made
prisoners
two
french
vessels
and
a
neapolitan
ship
had
also
been
captured
and
taken
to
algiers
the
indignation
of
napoleon
was
aroused
he
sent
an
officer
to
the
dey
with
a
letter
informing
him
that
if
the
prisoners
were
not
released
and
the
captured
vessels
instantly
restored
and
promise
given
to
respect
in
future
the
flags
of
france
and
italy
he
would
send
a
fleet
and
an
army
and
overwhelm
him
with
ruin
the
dey
had
heard
of
napoleon
career
in
egypt
he
was
thoroughly
frightened
restored
the
ships
and
the
prisoners
implored
clemency
and
with
barbarian
injustice
doomed
to
death
those
who
had
captured
the
ships
in
obedience
to
his
commands
their
lives
were
saved
only
through
the
intercession
of
the
french
minister
napoleon
then
performed
one
of
the
most
gracious
acts
of
courtesy
toward
the
pope
the
feeble
monarch
had
no
means
of
protecting
his
coasts
from
the
pirates
who
still
swarmed
in
those
seas
napoleon
selected
two
fine
brigs
in
the
naval
arsenal
at
toulon
equipped
them
with
great
elegance
armed
them
most
effectively
filled
them
with
naval
stores
and
conferring
upon
them
the
apostolical
names
of
peter
and
paul
sent
them
as
a
present
to
the
pontiff
with
characteristic
grandeur
of
action
he
carried
his
attentions
so
far
as
to
send
a
cutter
to
bring
back
the
crews
that
the
papal
treasury
might
be
exposed
to
no
expense
the
venerable
pope
in
the
exuberance
of
his
gratitude
insisted
upon
taking
the
french
seamen
to
rome
he
treated
them
with
every
attention
in
his
power
exhibited
to
them
peter
and
dazzled
them
with
the
pomp
and
splendor
of
cathedral
worship
they
returned
to
france
loaded
with
humble
presents
and
exceedingly
gratified
with
the
kindness
with
which
they
had
been
received
it
was
stipulated
in
the
treaty
of
amiens
that
both
england
and
france
should
evacuate
egypt
and
that
england
should
surrender
malta
to
its
ancient
rulers
malta
impregnable
in
its
fortifications
commanded
the
mediterranean
and
was
the
key
of
egypt
napoleon
had
therefore
while
he
professed
a
willingness
to
relinquish
all
claim
to
the
island
himself
insisted
upon
it
as
an
essential
point
that
england
should
do
the
same
the
question
upon
which
the
treaty
hinged
was
the
surrender
of
malta
to
a
neutral
power
the
treaty
was
signed
napoleon
promptly
and
scrupulously
fulfilled
his
agreements
several
embarrassments
for
which
england
was
not
responsible
delayed
for
a
few
months
the
evacuation
of
malta
but
now
nearly
a
year
had
passed
since
the
signing
of
the
treaty
all
obstacles
were
removed
from
the
way
of
its
entire
fulfillment
and
yet
the
troops
of
england
remained
both
in
egypt
and
in
malta
the
question
was
seriously
discussed
in
parliament
and
in
the
english
journals
whether
england
were
bound
to
fulfill
her
engagements
since
france
was
growing
so
alarmingly
powerful
generously
and
eloquently
fox
exclaimed
i
am
astonished
at
all
i
hear
particularly
when
i
consider
who
they
are
that
speak
such
words
indeed
i
am
more
grieved
than
any
of
the
honorable
friends
and
colleagues
of
pitt
at
the
growing
greatness
of
france
which
is
daily
extending
her
power
in
europe
and
in
america
that
france
now
accused
of
interfering
with
the
concerns
of
others
we
invaded
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
upon
her
a
government
to
which
she
would
not
submit
and
of
obliging
her
to
accept
the
family
of
the
bourbons
whose
yoke
she
spurned
by
one
of
those
sublime
movements
which
history
should
recommend
to
imitation
and
preserve
in
eternal
memorial
she
repelled
her
invaders
though
warmly
attached
to
the
cause
of
england
we
have
felt
an
involuntary
movement
of
sympathy
with
that
generous
outburst
of
liberty
and
we
have
no
desire
to
conceal
it
no
doubt
france
is
great
much
greater
than
a
good
englishman
ought
to
wish
but
that
ought
not
to
be
a
motive
for
violating
solemn
treaties
but
because
france
now
appears
too
great
to
us
greater
than
we
thought
her
at
first
to
break
a
solemn
engagement
to
retain
malta
for
instance
would
be
an
unworthy
breach
of
faith
which
would
compromise
the
honor
of
britain
i
am
sure
that
if
there
were
in
paris
an
assembly
similar
to
that
which
is
debating
here
the
british
navy
and
its
dominion
over
the
seas
would
he
talked
of
in
the
same
terms
as
we
talk
in
this
house
of
the
french
armies
and
their
dominion
over
the
land
napoleon
sincerely
wished
for
peace
he
was
constructing
vast
works
to
embellish
and
improve
the
empire
thousands
of
workmen
were
employed
in
cutting
magnificent
roads
across
the
alps
he
was
watching
with
intensest
interest
the
growth
of
fortifications
and
the
excavation
of
canals
he
was
in
the
possession
of
absolute
power
was
surrounded
by
universal
admiration
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
profound
peace
was
congratulating
himself
upon
being
the
pacificator
of
europe
he
had
disbanded
his
armies
and
was
consecrating
all
the
resources
of
the
nation
to
the
stimulation
of
industry
he
therefore
left
no
means
of
forbearance
and
conciliation
untried
to
avert
the
calamities
of
war
he
received
lord
whitworth
the
english
embassador
in
paris
with
great
distinction
the
most
delicate
attentions
were
paid
to
this
lady
the
duchess
of
dorset
splendid
entertainments
were
given
at
the
tuileries
and
at
st
cloud
in
their
honor
talleyrand
consecrated
to
them
all
the
resources
of
his
courtly
and
elegant
manners
the
two
associate
consuls
cambaceres
and
lebrum
were
also
unwearied
in
attentions
still
all
these
efforts
on
the
part
of
napoleon
to
secure
friendly
relations
with
england
were
unavailing
the
british
government
still
in
open
violation
of
the
treaty
retained
malta
the
honor
of
france
was
at
stake
in
enforcing
the
sacredness
of
treaties
malta
was
too
important
a
post
to
be
left
in
the
hands
of
england
napoleon
at
last
resolved
to
have
a
personal
interview
himself
with
lord
whitworth
and
explain
to
him
with
all
frankness
his
sentiments
and
his
resolves
it
was
on
the
evening
of
the
of
february
that
napoleon
received
lord
whitworth
in
his
cabinet
in
the
tuileries
a
large
occupied
the
middle
of
the
room
napoleon
invited
the
embassador
to
take
a
seat
at
one
end
of
the
table
and
seated
himself
at
the
other
i
have
wished
said
he
to
converse
with
you
in
person
that
i
may
fully
convince
you
of
my
real
opinions
and
intentions
then
with
that
force
of
language
and
that
perspicuity
which
no
man
ever
excelled
he
recapitulated
his
transactions
with
england
from
the
beginning
that
he
had
offered
peace
immediately
upon
the
accession
to
the
consulship
that
peace
had
been
refused
that
eagerly
he
had
renewed
negotiations
as
soon
as
he
could
with
any
propriety
do
so
and
that
he
had
made
great
concessions
to
secure
the
peace
of
amiens
but
my
efforts
said
he
to
live
on
good
terms
with
england
have
met
with
no
friendly
response
the
english
newspapers
breathe
but
animosity
against
me
the
journals
of
the
emigrants
are
allowed
a
license
of
abuse
which
is
not
justified
by
the
british
constitution
pensions
are
granted
to
georges
and
his
accomplices
who
are
plotting
my
assassination
the
emigrants
protected
in
england
are
continually
making
excursions
to
france
to
stir
up
civil
war
the
bourbon
princes
are
received
with
the
insignia
of
the
ancient
royalty
agents
are
sent
to
switzerland
and
italy
to
raise
up
difficulties
against
france
every
wind
which
blows
from
england
brings
me
but
hatred
and
insult
now
we
have
come
to
a
situation
from
which
we
must
relieve
ourselves
will
you
or
will
you
not
execute
the
treaty
of
amiens
i
have
executed
it
on
my
part
with
scrupulous
fidelity
that
treaty
obliged
me
to
evacuate
naples
tarento
and
the
roman
states
within
three
months
in
less
than
two
months
all
the
french
troops
were
out
of
those
countries
ten
months
have
elapsed
since
the
exchange
of
the
ratifications
and
the
english
troops
are
still
in
malta
and
at
alexandria
it
is
useless
to
try
to
deceive
us
on
this
point
will
you
have
peace
or
will
you
have
war
if
you
are
for
war
only
say
so
we
will
wage
it
unrelentingly
if
you
wish
for
peace
you
must
evacuate
alexandria
and
malta
the
rock
of
malta
on
which
so
many
fortifications
have
been
erected
is
in
a
maritime
point
of
view
an
object
of
great
importance
infinitely
greater
inasmuch
as
it
implicates
the
honor
of
france
what
would
the
world
say
if
we
were
to
allow
a
solemn
treaty
signed
with
us
to
be
violated
it
would
doubt
our
energy
for
my
part
my
resolution
is
fixed
i
had
rather
see
you
in
possession
of
the
heights
of
montmartre
than
in
possession
of
malta
if
you
doubt
my
desire
to
preserve
peace
listen
and
judge
how
far
i
am
sincere
though
yet
very
young
i
have
attained
a
power
a
renown
to
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
add
do
you
imagine
that
i
am
solicitous
to
risk
this
power
this
renown
in
a
desperate
struggle
if
i
have
a
war
with
austria
i
shall
contrive
to
find
the
way
to
vienna
if
i
have
a
war
with
you
i
will
take
from
you
every
ally
upon
the
continent
you
will
blockade
us
but
i
will
blockade
you
in
my
turn
you
will
make
the
continent
a
prison
for
us
but
i
will
make
the
seas
a
prison
for
you
however
to
conclude
the
war
there
must
be
more
direct
efficiency
there
must
be
assembled
men
and
an
immense
flotilla
we
must
try
to
cross
the
strait
and
perhaps
i
shall
bury
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
my
fortune
my
glory
my
life
it
is
an
awful
temerity
my
lord
the
invasion
of
england
here
to
the
amazement
of
lord
whitworth
napoleon
enumerated
frankly
and
powerfully
all
the
perils
of
the
enterprise
the
enormous
preparations
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
of
ships
men
and
munitions
of
difficulty
of
eluding
the
english
fleet
the
chance
that
we
shall
perish
said
he
is
vastly
greater
than
the
chance
that
we
shall
succeed
yet
this
temerity
my
lord
awful
as
it
is
i
am
determined
to
hazard
if
you
force
me
to
it
i
will
risk
my
army
and
my
life
with
me
that
great
enterprise
will
have
chances
which
it
can
not
have
with
any
other
see
now
if
i
ought
prosperous
powerful
and
peaceful
as
i
now
am
to
risk
power
prosperity
and
peace
in
such
an
enterprise
judge
if
when
i
say
i
am
desirous
of
peace
if
i
am
not
sincere
it
is
better
for
you
it
is
better
for
me
to
keep
within
the
limits
of
treaties
you
must
evacuate
malta
you
must
not
harbor
my
assassins
in
england
let
me
be
abused
if
you
please
by
the
english
journals
but
not
by
those
miserable
emigrants
who
dishonor
the
protection
you
grant
them
and
whom
the
alien
act
permits
you
to
expel
from
the
country
act
cordially
with
me
and
i
promise
you
on
my
part
an
entire
cordiality
see
what
power
we
should
exercise
over
the
world
if
we
could
bring
our
two
nations
together
you
have
a
navy
which
with
the
incessant
efforts
of
ten
years
in
the
employment
of
all
resources
i
should
not
be
able
to
equal
but
i
have
men
ready
to
march
under
my
command
whithersoever
i
choose
to
lead
them
if
you
are
masters
of
the
seas
i
am
master
of
the
land
let
us
then
think
of
uniting
rather
than
of
going
to
war
and
we
shall
rule
at
pleasure
the
destinies
of
the
world
france
and
england
united
can
do
every
thing
for
the
interests
of
humanity
england
however
still
refused
upon
one
pretense
and
another
to
yield
malta
and
both
parties
were
growing
more
and
more
exasperated
and
were
gradually
preparing
for
the
renewal
of
hostilities
napoleon
at
times
gave
very
free
utterance
to
his
indignation
malta
said
he
gives
the
dominion
of
the
mediterranean
nobody
will
believe
that
i
consent
to
surrender
the
mediterranean
to
the
english
unless
i
fear
their
power
i
thus
loose
the
most
important
sea
in
the
world
and
the
respect
of
europe
i
will
fight
to
the
last
for
the
possession
of
the
mediterranean
and
if
i
once
get
to
dover
it
is
all
over
with
those
tyrants
of
the
seas
besides
as
we
must
fight
sooner
or
later
with
a
people
to
whom
the
greatness
of
france
is
intolerable
the
sooner
the
better
i
am
young
the
english
are
in
the
wrong
more
so
than
they
will
ever
be
again
i
had
rather
settle
the
matter
at
once
they
shall
not
have
malta
still
napoleon
assented
to
the
proposal
for
negotiating
with
the
english
for
the
cession
of
some
other
island
in
the
mediterranean
let
them
obtain
a
port
to
put
into
said
he
to
that
i
have
no
objection
but
i
am
determined
that
they
shall
not
have
two
gibraltars
in
that
sea
one
at
the
entrance
and
one
in
the
middle
to
this
proposition
however
england
refused
assent
napoleon
then
proposed
that
the
island
of
malta
should
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
emperor
of
russia
leaving
it
with
him
in
trust
till
the
discussions
between
france
and
england
were
decided
it
had
so
happened
that
the
emperor
had
just
offered
his
mediation
if
that
could
be
available
to
prevent
a
war
this
the
english
government
also
declined
upon
the
plea
that
it
did
not
think
that
russia
would
be
willing
to
accept
the
office
thus
imposed
upon
her
the
english
embassador
now
received
instructions
to
demand
that
france
should
cede
to
england
malta
for
ten
years
and
that
england
by
way
of
compensation
would
recognize
the
italian
republic
the
embassador
was
ordered
to
apply
for
his
passports
if
these
conditions
were
not
accepted
within
seven
days
to
this
proposition
france
would
not
accede
the
english
minister
demanded
his
passports
and
left
france
immediately
the
english
fleet
commenced
its
attack
upon
french
wherever
they
could
be
found
and
the
world
was
again
deluged
in
war
france
has
recorded
her
past
history
and
her
present
condition
in
the
regal
palaces
she
has
reared
upon
these
monumental
walls
are
inscribed
in
letters
more
legible
than
the
hieroglyphics
of
egypt
and
as
ineffaceable
the
long
and
dreary
story
of
kingly
vice
voluptuousness
and
pride
and
of
popular
servility
and
oppression
the
unthinking
tourist
saunters
through
these
magnificent
saloons
upon
which
have
been
lavished
the
wealth
of
princes
and
the
toil
of
ages
and
admires
their
gorgeous
grandeur
in
marbled
floors
and
gilded
ceilings
and
damask
tapestry
and
all
the
appliances
of
boundless
luxury
and
opulence
he
sees
but
the
triumphs
of
art
and
bewildered
by
the
dazzling
spectacle
forgets
the
burning
outrage
upon
human
rights
which
it
proclaims
he
wanders
through
uncounted
acres
of
groves
and
lawns
and
parterres
of
flowers
embellished
with
lakes
fountains
cascades
and
the
most
voluptuous
statuary
where
kings
and
queens
have
reveled
and
he
reflects
not
upon
the
millions
who
have
toiled
from
dewy
morn
till
the
shades
of
night
through
long
and
joyless
years
eating
black
bread
clothed
in
coarse
raiment
the
man
the
woman
the
ox
companions
in
toil
companions
in
thought
to
minister
to
this
indulgence
but
the
palaces
of
france
proclaim
in
trumpet
tones
the
shame
of
france
they
say
to
her
kings
behold
the
undeniable
monuments
of
your
pride
your
insatiate
extortion
your
measureless
extravagance
and
luxury
they
say
to
the
people
behold
the
proofs
of
the
outrages
which
your
fathers
for
countless
ages
have
endured
they
lived
in
mud
hovels
that
their
licentious
kings
might
riot
haughtily
in
the
apartments
canopied
with
gold
of
versailles
the
tuileries
and
st
cloud
the
palaces
of
france
the
mind
of
the
political
economist
lingers
painfully
upon
them
they
are
gorgeous
as
specimens
of
art
they
are
sacred
as
memorials
of
the
past
vandalism
alone
would
raze
them
to
their
foundations
still
the
judgment
says
it
would
be
better
for
the
political
regeneration
of
france
if
like
the
bastile
their
very
foundations
were
plowed
up
and
sown
with
salt
for
they
are
a
perpetual
provocative
to
every
thinking
man
they
excite
unceasingly
democratic
rage
against
aristocratic
arrogance
thousands
of
noble
women
as
they
traverse
those
gorgeous
halls
feel
those
fires
of
indignation
glowing
in
their
souls
which
glowed
in
the
bosom
of
madame
roland
thousands
of
young
men
with
compressed
lip
and
moistened
eye
lean
against
those
marble
pillars
lost
in
thought
and
almost
excuse
even
the
demoniac
and
mercilessness
of
danton
marat
and
robespierre
these
palaces
are
a
perpetual
stimulus
and
provocative
to
governmental
aggression
there
they
stand
in
all
their
gorgeousness
empty
swept
and
garnished
they
are
resplendently
beautiful
they
are
supplied
with
every
convenience
every
luxury
king
and
emperor
dwelt
there
why
should
not
the
president
hence
the
palace
becomes
the
home
of
the
republican
president
the
expenses
of
the
palace
the
retinue
of
the
palace
the
court
etiquette
of
the
palace
become
the
requisitions
of
good
taste
in
america
the
head
of
the
government
in
his
convenient
and
appropriate
mansion
receives
a
salary
of
thousand
dollars
a
year
in
france
the
president
of
the
republic
receives
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
a
year
and
yet
even
with
that
vast
sum
can
not
keep
up
an
establishment
at
all
in
accordance
with
the
dwellings
of
grandeur
which
invite
his
occupancy
and
which
unceasingly
and
irresistibly
stimulate
to
regal
pomp
and
to
regal
extravagance
the
palaces
of
france
have
a
vast
influence
upon
the
present
politics
of
france
there
is
an
unceasing
conflict
between
those
marble
walls
of
monarchical
splendor
and
the
principles
of
republican
simplicity
this
contest
will
not
soon
terminate
and
its
result
no
one
can
foresee
never
have
i
felt
my
indignation
more
thoroughly
aroused
than
when
wandering
hour
after
hour
through
the
voluptuous
sumptuousness
of
versailles
the
triumphs
of
taste
and
art
are
admirable
beyond
the
power
of
the
pen
to
describe
but
the
moral
of
exeerable
oppression
is
deeply
inscribed
upon
all
in
a
brief
description
of
the
palaces
of
france
i
shall
present
them
in
the
order
in
which
i
chanced
to
visit
them
palais
des
thermes
in
centuries
which
have
faded
away
into
oblivion
a
wandering
tribe
of
barbarians
alighted
from
their
canoes
upon
a
small
island
in
the
seine
and
there
reared
their
huts
they
were
called
the
parisii
the
slow
lapse
of
centuries
rolled
over
them
and
there
were
wars
and
woes
bridals
and
burials
and
still
they
increased
in
numbers
and
in
strength
and
fortified
their
little
isle
against
the
invasions
of
their
enemies
for
man
whether
civilized
or
savage
has
ever
been
the
most
ferocious
wild
beast
man
has
had
to
encounter
but
soon
the
tramp
of
the
roman
legions
was
heard
upon
the
banks
of
the
seine
and
all
gaul
with
its
sixty
tribes
came
under
the
power
of
the
caesars
extensive
marshes
and
gloomy
forests
surrounded
the
barbarian
village
but
gradually
roman
laws
and
institutions
were
introduced
and
roman
energy
changed
the
aspect
of
the
country
immediately
the
proud
conquerors
commenced
rearing
a
palace
for
the
provincial
governor
the
palace
of
warm
baths
rose
with
its
massive
walls
and
in
imposing
grandeur
roman
spears
drove
the
people
to
the
work
and
roman
ingenuity
knew
well
how
to
extort
from
the
populace
the
revenue
which
was
required
large
remains
of
that
palace
continue
to
the
present
day
it
is
the
most
interesting
memorial
of
the
past
which
can
now
be
found
in
france
the
magnificence
of
its
proportions
still
strike
the
beholder
with
awe
behold
says
a
writer
who
trod
its
marble
floors
nearly
a
thousand
years
ago
behold
the
palace
of
the
kings
whose
turrets
pierce
the
skies
and
whose
foundations
penetrate
even
to
the
empire
of
the
dead
julius
caesar
gazed
proudly
upon
those
turrets
and
here
the
shouts
of
roman
legions
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
proclaimed
julian
emperor
and
roman
maidens
with
throbbing
hearts
trod
these
floors
in
the
mazy
dance
no
one
can
enter
the
grand
hall
of
the
haths
without
being
deeply
impressed
with
the
majestic
aspect
of
the
edifice
and
with
the
grandeur
of
its
gigantic
proportions
the
decay
of
nearly
two
thousand
years
has
left
its
venerable
impress
upon
those
walls
here
roman
generals
proudly
strode
encased
in
brass
and
steel
and
the
clatter
of
their
arms
resounded
through
these
arches
in
these
mouldering
crumbling
tubs
of
stone
they
laved
their
sinewy
limbs
but
where
are
those
fierce
warriors
now
in
what
employments
have
their
turbulent
spirits
been
engaged
while
generation
after
generation
has
passed
on
earth
in
the
enactment
of
the
comedies
and
the
tragedies
of
life
did
their
rough
tutelage
in
the
camp
and
their
proud
hearing
in
the
court
prepare
them
for
the
love
the
kindness
the
gentleness
the
devotion
of
heaven
in
fields
of
outrage
clamor
and
blood
madly
rushing
to
the
assault
shouting
in
frenzy
dealing
with
iron
hand
every
where
around
destruction
and
death
did
they
acquire
a
taste
for
the
green
pastures
and
the
still
waters
alas
for
the
mystery
of
our
being
they
are
gone
and
gone
forever
their
name
has
perished
their
language
is
forgotten
the
storm
which
wrecks
the
wintry
sky
no
more
disturbs
their
deep
repose
than
summer
evening
gentlest
sign
which
shuts
the
rose
upon
a
part
of
the
rums
of
this
old
palace
of
caesars
there
has
been
reared
by
more
modern
ancients
still
another
palace
where
mirth
and
revelry
have
resounded
where
pride
has
elevated
her
haughty
head
and
vanity
displayed
her
costly
robes
but
over
all
those
scenes
of
splendor
death
has
rolled
its
oblivious
waves
about
four
hundred
years
ago
upon
a
portion
of
the
crumbling
walls
of
this
old
roman
mansion
the
palace
of
cluny
was
reared
for
three
centuries
this
palace
was
one
of
the
abodes
of
the
kings
of
france
the
tide
of
regal
life
ebbed
and
flowed
through
those
saloons
and
along
those
corridors
there
is
the
chamber
where
mary
of
england
sister
of
henry
and
widow
of
louis
passed
the
weary
years
of
her
widowhood
it
is
still
called
the
chamber
of
the
white
queen
from
the
custom
of
the
queens
of
france
to
wear
white
mourning
three
hundred
years
ago
these
gothic
turrets
and
gorgeously
ornamented
lucarne
windows
gleamed
with
illuminations
as
the
young
king
of
scotland
james
led
madeleine
the
blooming
daughter
of
francis
to
the
bridal
altar
here
the
haughty
family
of
the
guises
ostentatiously
displayed
their
regal
retinue
vying
with
the
kings
of
france
in
splendor
and
outvying
them
in
power
these
two
palaces
now
blended
by
the
nuptails
of
decay
into
one
are
converted
into
a
museum
of
antiquities
silent
despositories
of
memorials
of
the
dead
sadly
one
loiters
through
their
deserted
halls
they
present
one
of
the
most
interesting
sights
of
paris
in
the
reflective
mind
they
awaken
emotions
which
the
pen
can
not
describe
the
lourre
when
paris
consisted
only
of
the
little
island
in
the
seine
and
kings
and
feudal
lords
with
wine
and
wassail
were
reveling
in
the
saloons
of
china
a
was
reared
in
the
the
dense
forest
which
spread
itself
along
the
banks
of
the
river
as
the
city
extended
and
the
forest
disappeared
the
was
enlarged
strengthened
and
became
a
fortress
and
a
thus
it
continued
for
three
hundred
years
in
its
gloomy
dungeons
prisoners
of
state
and
the
victims
of
crime
groaned
and
died
and
countless
tragedies
of
despotic
power
there
transpired
which
the
day
of
judgment
alone
can
reveal
three
hundred
years
ago
francis
i
tore
down
the
dilapidated
walls
of
this
old
castle
and
commerces
the
magnificent
palace
of
the
louver
upon
their
foundations
but
its
construction
has
required
candle
while
gilpin
who
was
taller
and
stronger
than
either
of
the
other
boys
bored
the
hole
in
the
door
in
the
place
which
rodolphus
indicated
when
the
hole
was
bored
the
boys
inserted
an
iron
rod
into
it
and
running
this
rod
under
the
hasp
they
pried
the
hasp
up
and
unfastened
the
door
they
opened
the
door
and
then
to
their
great
joy
found
themselves
all
safe
in
the
office
they
put
the
dark
lantern
down
upon
the
table
and
covered
it
with
its
screen
and
then
listened
perfectly
whist
a
minute
or
two
to
be
sure
that
nobody
was
coming
you
go
and
watch
at
the
said
gilpin
to
rodolphus
while
we
open
the
desk
so
rodolphus
went
to
the
he
peeped
out
and
looked
up
and
down
the
but
all
was
still
presently
he
heard
a
sort
of
splitting
sound
within
the
office
which
he
knew
was
made
by
the
forcing
open
of
the
lid
of
the
desk
very
soon
afterward
the
boys
came
out
in
a
hurried
manner
griff
had
the
lantern
and
gilpin
the
box
have
you
got
it
said
rodolphus
yes
said
griff
let
see
said
rodolphus
griff
held
out
the
box
to
rodolphus
it
was
very
heavy
and
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
money
within
all
three
of
the
boys
seemed
almost
wild
with
trepidation
and
excitement
griff
however
immediately
began
to
hurry
them
away
pulling
the
box
from
them
and
saying
come
come
boys
we
must
not
stay
fooling
here
wait
a
minute
till
i
hide
the
tools
again
said
rodolphus
and
then
we
run
rodolphus
hid
the
tools
behind
the
in
the
shed
where
they
had
been
before
and
then
the
boys
sallied
forth
into
the
street
they
crept
along
stealthily
in
the
shadows
of
the
houses
and
the
most
dark
and
obscure
places
until
they
came
to
the
tavern
where
they
were
to
turn
down
the
lane
to
the
as
soon
as
they
got
safely
to
this
lane
they
felt
relieved
and
they
walked
on
in
a
more
unconcerned
manner
and
when
at
length
they
got
fairly
in
under
the
they
felt
perfectly
secure
there
said
griff
was
not
that
well
done
yes
said
rodolphus
and
now
all
that
we
have
got
to
do
is
to
get
the
box
open
we
can
break
it
open
with
stones
said
griff
no
said
gilpin
that
will
make
too
much
noise
we
will
bury
it
under
this
straw
for
a
few
days
and
open
it
somehow
or
other
when
they
have
given
up
looking
for
the
box
you
can
get
the
real
key
of
it
for
us
rodolphus
ca
you
how
can
i
get
it
asked
rodolphus
oh
you
can
contrive
some
way
to
get
it
from
old
kerber
i
no
doubt
at
any
rate
the
best
thing
is
to
bury
it
now
to
this
plan
the
boys
all
agreed
they
pulled
away
the
straw
which
was
spread
under
the
and
dug
a
hole
in
the
ground
beneath
working
partly
with
sticks
and
partly
with
their
fingers
when
they
had
got
the
hole
deep
enough
they
put
the
box
in
and
covered
it
up
then
they
covered
it
up
then
they
spread
the
straw
over
the
place
as
before
during
all
this
time
the
lantern
had
been
standing
upon
a
box
pretty
near
by
having
been
put
there
by
the
boys
in
order
that
the
light
might
shine
down
upon
the
place
where
they
had
been
digging
as
soon
as
their
work
was
done
the
boys
went
softly
outside
to
see
if
the
way
was
clear
for
them
to
go
home
leaving
the
lantern
on
the
box
and
while
they
were
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
barn
outside
looking
up
the
lane
and
whispering
together
they
saw
suddenly
a
light
beginning
to
gleam
up
from
within
they
ran
in
and
found
that
the
lantern
had
fallen
down
and
that
the
straw
was
all
in
a
blaze
they
immediately
began
to
tread
upon
the
fire
and
try
to
put
it
out
but
the
instant
that
they
did
so
they
were
all
thunderstruck
by
the
appearance
of
a
fourth
person
who
came
rushing
in
among
them
from
the
outside
they
all
screamed
out
with
terror
and
ran
rodolphus
separated
from
the
rest
and
crouched
down
a
moment
behind
the
stone
wall
but
immediately
afterward
feeling
that
there
would
be
no
safety
for
him
here
he
set
off
again
and
ran
across
some
back
fields
and
gardens
in
the
direction
toward
kerber
he
looked
back
occasionally
and
found
that
the
light
was
rapidly
increasing
presently
he
began
to
hear
cries
of
fire
he
ran
on
till
he
reached
the
house
he
scrambled
over
the
fences
into
the
back
yard
climbed
up
upon
a
shed
crept
along
under
the
chimneys
to
the
window
of
his
room
got
in
as
fast
as
he
could
undressed
himself
and
went
to
bed
and
had
just
drawn
the
clothes
up
over
him
when
he
heard
a
loud
knocking
at
the
door
and
kerber
voice
outside
calling
out
to
him
that
there
was
a
cry
of
fire
in
the
village
and
that
he
must
get
up
quick
as
possible
and
help
put
it
out
the
expedition
to
egypt
was
one
of
the
most
magnificent
enterprises
which
human
ambition
ever
conceived
the
return
to
france
combines
still
more
if
possible
of
the
elements
of
the
moral
sublime
but
for
the
disastrous
destruction
of
the
french
fleet
the
plans
of
napoleon
in
reference
to
the
east
would
probably
have
been
triumphantly
successful
at
least
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
a
vast
change
would
have
been
effected
throughout
the
eastern
world
those
plans
were
now
hopeless
the
army
was
isolated
and
cut
off
from
all
reinforcements
and
all
supplies
the
best
thing
which
napoleon
could
do
for
his
troops
in
egypt
was
to
return
to
france
and
exert
his
personal
influence
in
sending
them
succor
his
return
involved
the
continuance
of
the
most
honorable
devotion
to
those
soldiers
whom
he
necessarily
left
behind
him
the
secrecy
of
his
departure
was
essential
to
its
success
had
the
bold
attempt
been
suspected
it
would
certainly
have
been
frustrated
by
the
increased
vigilance
of
the
english
cruisers
the
intrepidity
of
the
enterprise
must
elicit
universal
admiration
contemplate
for
a
moment
the
moral
aspects
of
this
undertaking
a
nation
of
thirty
millions
of
people
had
been
for
ten
years
agitated
by
the
most
terrible
convulsions
there
is
no
atrocity
which
the
tongue
can
name
which
had
not
desolated
the
doomed
land
every
passion
which
can
degrade
the
heart
of
fallen
man
had
swept
with
simoom
blast
over
the
cities
and
the
villages
of
france
conflagrations
had
laid
the
palaces
of
the
wealthy
in
ruins
and
the
green
lawns
where
their
children
had
played
had
been
crimsoned
with
the
blood
of
fathers
and
sons
mothers
and
daughters
a
gigantic
system
of
robbery
had
seized
upon
houses
and
lands
and
every
species
of
property
and
had
turned
thousands
of
the
opulent
out
into
destitution
beggary
and
death
pollution
had
been
legalized
by
the
voice
of
lust
and
france
la
belle
france
had
been
converted
into
a
disgusting
warehouse
of
infamy
law
with
suicidal
hand
had
destroyed
itself
and
the
decisions
of
the
legislature
swayed
to
and
fro
in
accordance
with
the
hideous
clamors
of
the
mob
the
guillotine
with
gutters
ever
clotted
with
human
gore
was
the
only
argument
which
anarchy
condescended
to
use
effectually
it
silenced
every
remonstrating
tongue
constitution
after
constitution
had
risen
like
mushrooms
in
a
night
and
like
mushrooms
had
perished
in
a
day
civil
war
was
raging
with
bloodhound
fury
in
france
monarchists
and
jacobins
grappling
each
other
infuriate
with
despair
the
allied
kings
of
europe
who
by
their
alliance
had
fanned
these
flames
of
rage
and
ruin
were
gazing
with
terror
upon
the
portentous
prodigy
and
were
surrounding
france
with
their
navies
and
their
armies
the
people
had
been
enslaved
for
centuries
by
the
king
and
the
nobles
their
oppression
had
been
execrable
and
it
had
become
absolutely
unendurable
we
the
millions
they
exclaimed
in
their
rage
will
no
longer
minister
to
your
voluptuousness
and
pride
and
lust
you
shall
you
insolent
dogs
exclaimed
king
and
nobles
we
heed
not
your
barking
you
shall
reiterated
the
pope
in
the
portentous
thunderings
of
the
vatican
you
shall
came
echoed
back
from
the
palaces
of
vienna
from
the
dome
of
the
kremlin
from
the
seraglio
of
the
turk
and
in
tones
deeper
stronger
more
resolute
from
constitutional
happy
england
then
was
france
a
volcano
and
its
deluged
europe
the
people
were
desperate
in
the
blind
fury
of
their
frenzied
they
lost
all
consideration
the
castles
of
the
nobles
were
but
the
monuments
of
past
taxation
and
servitude
with
yells
of
hatred
the
infuriated
populace
razed
them
to
the
ground
the
palaces
of
the
kings
where
for
uncounted
centuries
dissolute
monarchs
had
reveled
in
enervating
and
pleasures
were
but
national
badges
of
the
bondage
of
the
people
the
indignant
throng
swept
through
them
like
a
mississippi
inundation
leaving
upon
marble
floors
and
cartooned
walls
and
ceilings
the
impress
of
their
rage
at
one
bound
france
had
passed
from
despotism
to
anarchy
the
kingly
tyrant
with
golden
crown
and
iron
sceptre
surrounded
by
wealthy
nobles
and
dissolute
beauties
had
disappeared
and
a
monster
rapacious
and
vulgar
and
revolting
had
emerged
from
mines
and
workshops
and
the
cellars
of
vice
and
penury
like
one
of
the
spectres
of
fairy
tales
to
fill
his
place
france
had
passed
from
monarchy
not
to
healthy
republicanism
but
to
jacobinism
to
the
reign
of
the
mob
napoleon
utterly
abhorred
the
tyranny
of
the
king
he
also
utterly
abhorred
the
despotism
of
vulgar
violent
sanguinary
jacobin
misrule
the
latter
he
regarded
with
even
far
deeper
repugnance
than
the
former
i
frankly
confess
said
napoleon
again
and
again
that
if
i
must
choose
between
bourbon
oppression
and
mob
violence
i
infinitely
prefer
the
former
such
had
been
the
state
of
france
essentially
for
nearly
ten
years
the
great
mass
of
the
people
were
exhausted
with
suffering
and
longed
for
repose
the
land
was
filled
with
plots
and
counterplots
but
there
was
no
one
man
of
sufficient
prominence
to
carry
with
him
the
nation
the
government
was
despised
and
disregarded
france
was
in
a
state
of
chaotic
ruin
many
voices
here
and
there
began
to
inquire
where
is
bonaparte
the
conqueror
of
italy
the
conqueror
of
egypt
he
alone
can
save
us
his
renown
turned
the
eyes
of
the
nation
to
him
as
their
only
hope
under
these
circumstances
napoleon
then
a
young
man
but
years
of
age
and
who
but
three
years
before
had
been
unknown
to
fame
or
to
fortune
resolved
to
return
to
france
to
overthrow
the
miserable
government
by
which
the
country
was
disgraced
to
subdue
anarchy
at
home
and
aggression
from
abroad
and
to
rescue
thirty
millions
of
people
from
ruin
the
enterprise
was
undeniably
magnificent
in
its
grandeur
and
noble
in
its
object
he
had
two
foes
to
encounter
each
formidable
the
royalists
of
combined
europe
and
the
mob
of
paris
the
quiet
and
undoubting
with
which
he
entered
upon
this
enterprise
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
events
in
the
whole
of
his
extraordinay
career
he
took
with
him
no
armies
to
hew
down
opposition
he
engaged
in
no
and
conspiracy
relying
upon
the
energies
of
his
own
mind
and
upon
the
sympathies
of
the
great
mass
of
the
people
he
went
alone
with
but
one
or
two
companions
to
whom
he
revealed
not
his
thoughts
to
gather
into
his
hands
the
scattered
reins
of
power
never
did
he
encounter
more
fearful
peril
the
cruisers
of
england
russia
turkey
of
allied
europe
in
arms
against
france
thronged
the
mediterranean
how
could
he
hope
to
escape
them
the
guillotine
was
red
with
blood
every
one
who
had
dared
to
oppose
the
mob
had
perished
upon
it
how
could
napoleon
venture
to
beard
this
terrible
lion
in
his
den
it
was
ten
at
night
the
of
august
when
napoleon
ascended
the
sides
of
the
frigate
muiron
to
france
a
few
of
his
faithful
guards
and
eight
companions
either
officers
in
the
army
or
members
of
the
scientific
corps
accompanied
him
there
were
five
hundred
soldiers
on
board
the
ships
the
stars
shone
brightly
in
the
syrian
sky
and
under
their
soft
light
the
blue
waves
of
the
mediterranean
lay
spread
out
most
peacefully
before
them
the
frigates
unfurled
their
sails
napoleon
silent
and
lost
in
thought
for
a
long
time
walked
the
quarter
deck
of
the
ship
gazing
upon
the
low
outline
of
egypt
as
in
the
dim
starlight
it
faded
away
his
companions
were
intoxicated
with
delight
in
view
of
again
returning
to
france
napoleon
was
neither
elated
nor
depressed
serene
and
silent
he
communed
with
himself
and
whenever
we
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
those
secret
communings
we
find
them
always
bearing
the
impress
of
grandeur
though
napoleon
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
the
soldiers
at
their
camp
fires
of
sitting
down
and
conversing
with
them
with
the
greatest
freedom
and
familiarity
the
majesty
of
his
character
overawed
his
officers
and
adoration
and
reserve
blended
with
their
love
though
there
was
no
haughtiness
in
his
demeanor
he
habitually
dwelt
in
a
region
of
elevation
above
them
all
their
talk
was
of
cards
of
wine
of
pretty
women
napoleon
thoughts
were
of
empire
of
renown
of
moulding
the
destinies
of
nations
they
regarded
him
not
as
a
companion
but
as
a
master
whose
wishes
they
loved
to
anticipate
for
he
would
surely
guide
them
to
wealth
and
fame
and
fortune
he
contemplated
them
not
as
equals
and
confiding
friends
but
as
efficient
and
valuable
instruments
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
purposes
murat
was
to
napoleon
a
body
of
ten
thousand
horsemen
ever
ready
for
a
resistless
charge
lannes
was
a
phalanx
of
infantry
bristling
with
bayonets
which
neither
artillery
nor
cavalry
could
batter
down
or
break
augereau
was
an
armed
column
of
invincible
troops
black
dense
massy
impetuous
resistless
moving
with
gigantic
tread
wherever
the
finger
of
the
conqueror
pointed
these
were
but
the
members
of
napoleon
body
the
limbs
obedient
to
the
mighty
soul
which
swayed
them
they
were
not
the
companions
of
his
thoughts
they
were
only
the
servants
of
his
will
the
number
to
be
found
with
whom
the
soul
of
napoleon
could
dwell
in
sympathetic
friendship
was
few
very
few
napoleon
had
formed
a
very
low
estimate
of
human
nature
and
consequently
made
great
allowance
for
the
infirmities
incident
to
humanity
bourrienne
reports
him
as
saying
friendship
is
but
a
name
i
love
no
one
no
not
even
my
brothers
joseph
perhaps
a
little
and
if
i
do
love
him
it
is
from
habit
and
because
he
is
my
elder
duroc
ah
yes
i
love
him
too
but
why
his
character
please
me
he
is
cold
reserved
and
resolute
and
i
really
believe
that
he
never
shed
a
tear
as
to
myself
i
know
well
that
i
have
not
one
true
friend
as
long
as
i
continue
what
i
am
i
may
have
as
many
pretended
friends
as
i
please
we
must
leave
sensibility
to
the
women
it
is
their
business
men
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
war
or
government
i
am
not
amiable
no
i
am
not
amiable
i
never
have
been
but
i
am
just
in
another
mood
of
mind
more
tender
more
subdued
he
remarked
at
helena
in
reply
to
las
casas
who
with
great
severity
was
condemning
those
who
abandoned
napoleon
in
his
hour
of
adversity
you
are
not
acquainted
with
men
they
are
difficult
to
comprehend
if
one
wishes
to
be
strictly
just
can
they
understand
or
explain
even
their
own
characters
almost
all
those
who
abandoned
me
would
had
i
continued
to
be
prosperous
never
perhaps
have
dreamed
of
their
own
defection
there
are
vices
and
virtues
which
depend
upon
circumstances
our
last
trials
were
beyond
all
human
strength
besides
i
was
forsaken
rather
than
betrayed
there
was
more
weakness
than
of
perfidy
around
me
it
was
the
denial
of
peter
tears
and
penitence
are
probably
at
hand
and
where
will
you
find
in
the
page
of
history
any
one
possessing
a
greater
number
of
friends
and
partisans
who
was
ever
more
popular
and
more
beloved
who
was
ever
more
ardently
and
deeply
regretted
here
from
this
very
rock
on
viewing
the
present
disorders
in
france
who
would
not
be
tempted
to
say
that
i
still
reign
there
no
human
nature
might
have
appeared
in
a
more
odious
light
las
casas
who
shared
with
napoleon
his
weary
years
of
imprisonment
at
helena
says
of
him
he
views
the
complicated
circumstances
of
his
from
so
high
a
point
that
individuals
escape
his
notice
he
never
evinces
the
least
symptom
of
virulence
toward
those
of
whom
it
might
be
supposed
he
has
the
greatest
reason
to
complain
his
strongest
mark
of
reprobation
and
i
have
had
frequent
occasions
to
notice
it
is
to
preserve
silence
with
respect
to
them
whenever
they
are
mentioned
in
his
presence
but
how
often
has
he
been
heard
to
restrain
the
violent
and
less
reserved
expressions
of
those
about
him
and
here
i
must
observe
say
las
casas
that
since
i
have
become
acquainted
with
the
emperor
character
i
have
never
known
him
to
evince
for
a
single
moment
the
least
feeling
of
anger
or
animosity
against
those
who
had
most
deeply
injured
him
he
speaks
of
them
coolly
and
without
resentment
attributing
their
conduct
in
some
measure
to
the
place
and
throwing
the
rest
to
the
account
of
human
weakness
marmont
who
surrendered
paris
to
the
allies
was
severely
condemned
by
las
casas
napoleon
replied
vanity
was
his
ruin
posterity
will
justly
cast
a
shade
upon
his
character
yet
his
heart
will
be
more
valued
than
the
memory
of
his
career
your
attachment
for
berthier
said
las
casas
surprised
us
he
was
full
of
pretensions
and
pride
berthier
was
not
with
out
talent
napoleon
replied
and
i
am
far
from
wishing
to
disavow
his
merit
or
my
partiality
but
he
was
so
undecided
he
was
very
harsh
and
overbearing
las
casas
rejoined
and
what
my
dear
las
casas
napoleon
replied
is
more
overbearing
than
weakness
which
feels
itself
protected
by
strength
look
at
women
for
example
this
berthier
had
with
the
utmost
meanness
abandoned
his
benefactor
and
took
his
place
in
front
of
the
carriage
of
louis
xviii
as
he
rode
triumphantly
into
paris
the
only
revenge
i
wish
on
this
poor
berthier
said
napoleon
at
the
time
would
be
to
see
him
in
his
costume
of
captain
of
the
of
louis
says
bourrienne
napoleon
rejected
secretary
the
character
of
napoleon
was
not
a
cruel
one
he
was
neither
rancorous
nor
vindictive
none
but
those
who
are
blinded
by
fury
could
have
given
him
the
name
of
nero
or
caligula
i
think
that
i
have
stated
his
real
fault
with
sufficient
sincerity
to
be
believed
upon
my
word
i
can
assert
that
bonaparte
apart
from
politics
was
feeling
kind
and
accessible
to
pity
he
was
very
fond
of
children
and
a
bad
man
has
seldom
that
disposition
in
the
habits
of
private
life
he
had
and
the
expression
is
not
too
strong
much
benevolence
and
great
indulgence
for
human
weakness
a
contrary
opinion
is
too
firmly
fixed
in
some
minds
for
me
to
hope
to
remove
it
i
shall
i
fear
have
opposers
but
i
address
myself
to
those
who
are
in
search
of
truth
i
lived
in
the
most
unreserved
confidence
with
napoleon
until
the
age
of
years
and
i
advance
nothing
lightly
this
is
the
admission
of
one
who
had
been
ejected
from
office
by
napoleon
and
who
become
a
courtier
of
the
reinstated
bourbons
it
is
a
candid
admission
of
an
enemy
the
ships
weighed
anchor
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
hoping
before
the
day
should
dawn
to
escape
the
english
cruisers
which
were
hovering
about
alexandria
unfortunately
at
midnight
the
wind
died
away
and
it
became
almost
perfectly
calm
fearful
of
being
captured
some
were
anxious
to
seek
again
the
shore
be
quiet
said
napoleon
we
shall
pass
in
safety
admiral
gantheaume
wished
to
take
the
shortest
route
to
france
napoleon
however
directed
the
admiral
to
sail
along
as
near
as
possible
the
coast
of
africa
and
to
continue
that
unfrequented
route
till
the
ships
should
pass
the
island
of
sardinia
in
the
mean
while
said
he
should
an
english
fleet
present
itself
we
will
run
ashore
upon
the
sands
and
march
with
the
handful
of
brave
men
and
the
few
pieces
of
artillery
we
have
with
us
to
oran
or
tunis
and
there
find
means
to
thus
napoleon
is
this
hazardous
enterprise
braved
every
peril
the
most
imminent
and
the
most
to
be
dreaded
of
all
was
captivity
in
an
english
prison
for
twenty
days
the
wind
was
so
invariable
adverse
that
the
ships
did
not
advance
three
hundred
miles
many
were
so
discouraged
and
so
apprehensive
of
capture
that
it
was
even
proposed
to
return
to
alexandria
napoleon
was
much
in
the
habit
of
peaceful
submission
to
that
which
he
could
not
remedy
during
all
these
trying
weeks
he
appeared
perfectly
serene
and
contented
to
the
murmuring
of
his
companions
he
replied
we
shall
arrive
in
france
in
safety
i
am
determined
to
proceed
at
all
hazards
fortune
will
not
abandon
us
people
frequently
speak
says
bourrienne
who
accompanied
napoleon
upon
this
voyage
of
the
good
fortune
which
attaches
to
an
individual
and
even
attends
him
this
sort
of
predestination
yet
when
i
call
to
mind
the
numerous
dangers
which
bonaparte
escaped
in
so
many
enterprises
the
hazards
he
encountered
the
chances
he
ran
i
can
conceive
that
others
may
have
this
faith
but
having
for
a
length
of
time
studied
the
of
destiny
i
have
remarked
that
what
was
called
his
fortune
was
in
reality
his
genius
that
his
success
was
the
consequence
of
his
admirable
foresight
of
his
calculations
rapid
as
lightning
and
of
the
conviction
that
boldness
is
often
the
truest
wisdom
if
for
example
during
our
voyage
from
egypt
to
france
he
had
not
imperiously
insisted
upon
pursuing
a
course
different
from
that
usually
taken
and
which
usual
course
was
recommended
by
the
admiral
would
he
have
escaped
the
perils
which
beset
his
path
probably
not
and
was
all
this
the
effect
of
chance
certainly
not
during
these
days
of
suspense
napoleon
apparently
as
serene
in
spirit
as
the
calm
which
often
silvered
the
unrippled
surface
of
the
sea
held
all
the
energies
of
his
mind
in
perfect
control
a
choice
library
he
invariably
took
with
him
wherever
he
went
he
devoted
the
hours
to
writing
study
finding
recreation
in
solving
the
most
difficult
problems
in
geometry
and
in
investigating
chemistry
and
other
scientific
subjects
of
practical
utility
he
devoted
much
time
to
conversation
with
the
distinguished
scholars
whom
he
had
selected
to
accompany
him
his
whole
soul
seemed
engrossed
in
the
pursuit
of
literary
and
scientific
attainments
he
also
carefully
and
with
most
intense
interest
studied
the
bible
and
koran
scrutinizing
with
the
eye
of
a
philosopher
the
antagonistic
system
of
the
christian
and
the
moslem
the
limity
of
the
scriptures
charmed
him
he
read
again
and
again
with
deep
admiration
christ
sermon
upon
the
mount
and
called
his
companions
form
their
to
read
it
to
them
that
they
might
also
appreciate
its
moral
beauty
and
its
eloquence
you
will
ere
long
become
devout
yourself
said
one
of
his
infidel
companions
i
wish
i
might
become
so
napoleon
replied
what
a
solace
christianity
must
be
to
one
who
has
an
undoubting
conviction
of
its
truth
but
practical
christianity
he
had
only
seen
in
the
mummeries
of
the
papal
church
remembering
the
fasts
the
vigils
the
penances
the
cloisters
the
scourgings
of
a
corrupt
christianity
and
contrasting
them
with
the
voluptuous
paradise
and
the
sensual
houries
which
inflamed
the
eager
vision
of
the
moslem
he
once
exclaimed
in
phrase
characteristic
of
his
genius
the
religion
of
jesus
is
a
threat
that
of
mohammed
the
religion
of
jesus
is
not
a
threat
though
the
wrath
of
god
shall
fall
upon
the
children
of
disobedience
our
saviour
invites
us
in
gentle
accents
to
the
green
pastures
and
the
still
waters
of
the
heavenly
canaan
to
cities
resplendent
with
pearls
and
gold
to
mansions
of
which
god
is
the
architect
to
the
songs
of
seraphim
and
the
flight
of
cherubim
exploring
on
tireless
pinion
the
wonders
of
infinity
to
peace
of
conscience
and
rapture
dwelling
in
pure
heart
and
to
blest
companionship
loving
and
beloved
to
majesty
of
person
and
loftiness
of
intellect
to
appear
as
children
and
as
nobles
in
the
of
god
to
an
immorality
of
bliss
no
the
religion
of
jesus
is
not
a
threat
though
it
has
too
often
been
thus
represented
by
its
mistaken
or
designing
advocates
one
evening
a
group
of
officers
were
conversing
together
upon
the
quarter
deck
respecting
the
existence
of
god
many
of
them
believed
not
in
his
being
it
was
a
calm
cloudless
brilliant
night
the
heavens
the
work
of
god
fingers
canopied
them
gloriously
the
moon
and
the
stars
which
god
had
ordained
beamed
down
upon
them
with
serene
lustre
as
they
were
flippantly
giving
utterance
to
the
arguments
of
atheism
napoleon
paced
to
and
fro
upon
the
deck
taking
no
part
in
the
conversation
and
apparently
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
suddenly
he
stopped
before
them
and
said
in
those
tones
of
dignity
which
ever
overawed
gentlemen
your
arguments
are
very
fine
but
who
made
all
those
worlds
beaming
so
gloriously
above
us
can
you
tell
me
that
no
one
answered
napoleon
resumed
his
silent
walk
and
the
officers
selected
another
topic
for
conversation
in
these
intense
studies
napoleon
first
began
to
appreciate
the
beauty
and
the
sublimity
of
christianity
previously
to
this
his
own
strong
sense
had
taught
him
the
principles
of
a
noble
toleration
and
jew
christian
and
moslem
stood
equally
regarded
before
him
now
he
began
to
apprehend
the
surpassing
excellence
of
christianity
and
though
the
cares
of
the
busiest
life
through
which
a
mortal
has
ever
passed
soon
engrossed
his
energies
this
appreciation
and
admiration
of
the
gospel
of
christ
visibly
increased
with
each
succeeding
year
he
unflinchingly
braved
the
scoffs
of
infidel
europe
in
the
christian
religion
in
paganized
france
he
periled
his
popularity
with
the
army
and
disregarded
the
opposition
of
his
most
influential
friends
from
his
deep
conviction
of
the
importance
of
religion
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
with
the
inimitable
force
of
his
own
glowing
eloquence
he
said
to
montholon
at
helena
i
know
men
and
i
tell
you
that
jesus
christ
is
not
a
man
the
religion
of
christ
is
a
mystery
which
subsists
by
its
own
force
and
proceeds
from
a
mind
which
is
not
a
human
mind
we
find
in
it
a
marked
individuality
which
originated
a
train
of
words
and
maxims
unknown
before
jesus
borrowed
nothing
from
our
knowledge
he
exhibited
himself
the
perfect
example
of
his
precepts
jesus
is
not
a
philosopher
for
his
proofs
are
his
miracles
and
from
the
first
his
disciples
adored
him
in
fact
learning
and
philosophy
are
of
no
use
for
salvation
and
jesus
came
into
the
world
to
reveal
the
mysteries
of
heaven
and
the
laws
of
the
spirit
alexander
caesar
charlemagne
and
myself
have
founded
empires
but
upon
what
did
we
rest
the
creations
of
our
genius
upon
force
jesus
christ
alone
founded
his
empire
upon
love
and
at
this
moment
millions
of
men
would
die
for
him
i
die
before
my
time
and
my
body
will
be
given
back
to
earth
to
become
food
for
worms
such
is
the
fate
of
him
who
has
been
called
the
great
napoleon
what
an
abyss
between
my
deep
misery
and
the
eternal
kingdom
of
christ
which
is
proclaimed
loved
and
adored
and
which
is
extending
over
the
whole
earth
call
you
this
dying
is
it
not
living
rather
the
death
of
christ
is
the
death
of
a
god
at
the
time
of
the
invasion
of
egypt
napoleon
regarded
all
forms
of
religion
with
equal
respect
and
though
he
considered
christianity
superior
in
intellectuality
and
refinement
to
all
other
modes
of
worship
he
did
not
consider
any
religion
as
of
divine
origin
at
one
time
speaking
of
the
course
which
he
pursued
in
egypt
he
said
such
was
the
disposition
of
the
army
that
in
order
to
induce
them
to
listen
to
the
bare
mention
of
religion
i
was
obliged
to
speak
very
lightly
on
the
subject
to
place
jews
beside
christians
and
rabbis
beside
bishops
but
after
all
it
would
not
have
been
so
very
extraordinary
had
circumstances
induced
me
to
embrace
islamism
but
i
must
have
had
good
reasons
for
my
conversion
i
must
have
been
secure
of
advancing
at
least
as
far
as
the
euphrates
change
of
religion
for
private
interest
is
inexcusable
but
it
may
be
pardoned
in
consideration
of
immense
political
results
henry
iv
said
paris
is
well
worth
a
mass
will
it
then
be
said
that
the
dominion
of
the
east
and
perhaps
the
subjugation
of
all
asia
were
not
worth
a
turban
and
a
pair
of
trousers
and
in
truth
the
whole
matter
was
reduced
to
this
the
sheiks
had
studied
how
to
render
it
easy
to
us
they
had
smoothed
down
the
great
obstacles
allowed
us
the
use
of
wine
and
dispensed
with
all
corporeal
formalities
we
should
have
lost
only
our
and
hats
of
the
infidel
rousseau
napoleon
ever
spoke
in
terms
of
severe
reprobation
he
was
a
bad
man
a
very
bad
man
said
he
he
caused
the
revolution
i
was
not
aware
another
replied
that
you
considered
the
french
revolution
such
an
unmixed
evil
ah
napoleon
rejoined
you
wish
to
say
that
without
the
revolution
you
would
not
have
had
me
nevertheless
without
the
revolution
france
would
have
been
more
happy
when
invited
to
visit
the
hermitage
of
rousseau
to
see
his
cap
table
great
chair
he
exclaimed
bah
i
have
no
taste
for
such
fooleries
show
them
to
my
brother
louis
he
is
worthy
of
them
probably
the
following
remarks
of
napoleon
made
at
helena
will
give
a
very
correct
idea
of
his
prevailing
feeling
upon
the
subject
of
religion
the
sentiment
of
religion
is
so
consolatory
that
it
must
be
considered
a
gift
from
heaven
what
a
resource
would
it
not
be
for
us
here
to
possess
it
what
rewards
have
i
not
a
right
to
expect
who
have
run
a
career
so
extraordinary
so
tempestuous
as
mine
has
been
without
committing
a
single
crime
and
yet
how
many
might
i
not
have
been
guilty
of
i
can
appear
before
the
tribunal
of
god
i
can
await
his
judgment
without
fear
he
will
not
find
my
conscience
stained
with
the
thoughts
of
murder
and
poisonings
with
the
infliction
of
violent
and
premeditated
deaths
events
so
common
in
the
history
of
those
whose
lives
resemble
mine
i
have
wished
only
for
the
power
the
greatness
the
glory
of
france
all
my
faculties
all
my
efforts
all
my
movements
were
directed
to
the
attainment
of
that
object
these
can
not
be
crimes
to
me
they
appeared
acts
of
virtue
what
then
would
be
my
happiness
if
the
bright
prospect
of
futurity
presented
itself
to
crown
the
last
moments
of
my
existence
after
a
moment
pause
in
which
he
seemed
lost
in
thought
he
resumed
but
how
is
it
possible
that
conviction
can
find
its
way
to
our
hearts
when
we
hear
the
absurd
language
and
witness
the
iniquitous
conduct
of
the
greater
part
of
those
whose
business
it
is
to
preach
to
us
i
am
surrounded
by
priests
who
repeat
incessantly
that
their
reign
is
not
of
this
world
and
yet
they
lay
their
hands
upon
every
thing
which
they
can
get
the
pope
is
the
head
of
that
religion
which
is
from
heaven
what
did
the
present
chief
pontiff
who
is
undoubtedly
a
good
and
a
holy
man
not
offer
to
be
allowed
to
return
to
rome
the
surrender
of
the
government
of
the
church
of
the
institution
of
bishops
was
not
too
much
for
him
to
give
to
become
once
more
a
secular
prince
nevertheless
he
continued
after
another
thoughtful
pause
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
as
emperor
the
species
of
incredulity
which
i
felt
was
beneficial
to
the
nations
i
had
to
govern
how
could
i
have
favored
equally
sects
so
opposed
to
one
another
if
i
had
joined
any
one
of
them
how
could
i
have
preserved
the
independence
of
my
thoughts
and
of
my
actions
under
the
control
of
a
confessor
who
would
have
governed
me
under
the
dread
of
hell
napoleon
closed
this
conversation
by
ordering
the
new
testament
to
be
brought
commencing
at
the
beginning
he
read
aloud
as
far
as
the
conclusion
of
our
savior
address
to
his
disciples
upon
the
mountain
he
expressed
himself
struck
with
the
highest
admiration
in
contemplating
its
purity
its
sublimity
and
the
beautiful
perfection
of
its
moral
code
for
forty
days
the
ships
were
driven
about
by
contrary
winds
and
on
the
of
october
they
made
the
island
of
corsica
and
took
refuge
in
the
harbor
of
ajaccio
the
tidings
that
napoleon
had
landed
in
his
native
town
swept
over
the
island
like
a
gale
and
the
whole
population
crowded
to
the
port
to
catch
a
sight
of
their
illustrious
countryman
it
seemed
said
napoleon
that
half
of
the
inhabitants
had
discovered
traces
of
kindred
but
a
few
years
had
elapsed
since
the
dwelling
of
madame
letitia
was
pillaged
by
the
mob
and
the
whole
bonaparte
family
in
penury
and
friendlessness
were
hunted
from
their
home
effecting
their
escape
in
an
open
boat
by
night
now
the
name
of
bonaparte
filled
the
island
with
acclamations
but
napoleon
was
alike
indifferent
to
such
unjust
censure
and
to
such
unthinking
applause
as
the
curse
did
not
depress
neither
did
the
hosanna
elate
after
the
delay
of
a
few
days
in
obtaining
supplies
the
ships
again
weighed
anchor
on
the
of
october
and
continued
their
perilous
voyage
the
evening
of
the
next
day
as
the
sun
was
going
down
in
unusual
splendor
there
appeared
in
the
west
painted
in
strong
relief
against
his
golden
rays
an
english
squadron
the
admiral
who
saw
from
the
enemy
signals
that
he
was
observed
urged
an
immediate
return
to
corsica
napoleon
convinced
that
capture
would
be
the
result
of
such
a
manoeuvre
exclaimed
to
do
so
would
be
to
take
the
road
to
england
i
am
seeking
that
to
france
spread
all
sail
let
every
one
be
at
his
post
steer
to
the
northwest
onward
the
night
was
dark
the
wind
fair
rapidly
the
ships
were
approaching
the
coast
of
france
through
the
midst
of
the
hostile
squadron
and
exposed
to
the
most
imminent
danger
of
capture
escape
seemed
impossible
it
was
a
night
of
fearful
apprehension
and
terror
to
all
on
board
excepting
napoleon
he
determined
in
case
of
extremity
to
throw
himself
into
a
boat
and
trust
for
safety
to
darkness
and
the
oars
with
the
most
perfect
and
composure
of
spirits
he
ordered
the
to
be
prepared
selected
those
whom
he
desired
to
accompany
him
and
carefully
collected
such
papers
as
he
was
anxious
to
preserve
not
an
eye
was
closed
during
the
night
it
was
indeed
a
fearful
question
to
be
decided
are
these
weary
wanderers
in
a
few
hours
to
be
in
the
embrace
of
their
wives
and
their
children
or
will
the
next
moment
show
them
the
black
hull
of
an
english
war
emerging
from
the
gloom
to
consign
them
to
lingering
years
of
captivity
in
an
english
prison
in
this
terrible
hour
no
one
could
perceive
that
the
composure
of
napoleon
was
in
the
slightest
degree
ruffled
the
first
drawn
of
the
morning
revealed
to
their
straining
vision
the
hills
of
france
stretching
along
but
a
few
leagues
before
them
and
far
away
in
the
northeast
the
hostile
squadron
disappearing
beneath
the
horizon
of
the
sea
the
french
had
escaped
the
wildest
bursts
of
joy
rose
from
the
ships
but
napoleon
gazed
calmly
upon
his
beloved
france
with
pale
cheek
and
marble
brow
too
proud
to
manifest
emotion
at
eight
in
the
morning
the
four
vessels
dropped
anchor
in
the
little
harbor
of
frejus
it
was
the
morning
of
the
of
october
thus
for
fifty
days
napoleon
had
been
tossed
upon
the
waves
of
the
mediterranean
surrounded
by
the
hostile
flects
of
england
russia
and
turkey
and
yet
had
eluded
their
vigilance
this
wonderful
passage
of
napoleon
gave
rise
to
many
caricatures
both
in
england
and
france
one
of
these
caricatures
which
was
conspicuous
in
the
london
shop
windows
possessed
so
much
point
and
historic
truth
that
napoleon
is
said
to
have
laughed
most
heartily
on
seeing
it
lord
nelson
as
is
well
known
with
all
his
heroism
was
not
exempt
from
the
frailties
of
humanity
the
british
admiral
was
represented
as
guarding
napoleon
lady
hamilton
makes
her
appearance
and
his
lordship
becomes
so
engrossed
in
caressing
the
fair
enchantress
that
napoleon
escapes
between
his
legs
this
was
hardly
a
caricature
it
was
almost
historic
verity
while
napoleon
was
struggling
against
adverse
storms
off
the
coast
of
africa
lord
nelson
adorned
with
the
laurels
of
his
magnificent
victory
in
fond
dalliance
with
his
frail
delilah
was
basking
in
the
courts
of
voluptuous
and
profligate
kings
no
one
said
napoleon
can
surrender
himself
to
the
dominion
of
love
without
the
forfeiture
of
some
palms
of
glory
when
the
four
vessels
entered
the
harbor
of
frejus
a
signal
at
the
of
the
muiron
informed
the
authorities
on
shore
that
napoleon
was
on
board
the
whole
town
was
instantly
in
commotion
before
the
anchors
were
dropped
the
harbor
was
filled
with
boats
and
the
ships
were
surrounded
with
an
enthusiastic
multitude
climbing
their
sides
thronging
their
decks
and
rending
the
air
with
their
acclamations
all
the
laws
of
quarantine
were
disregarded
the
people
weary
of
anarchy
and
trembling
in
view
of
the
approaching
austrian
invasion
were
almost
delirious
with
delight
in
receiving
thus
as
it
were
from
the
clouds
a
deliverer
in
whose
potency
they
could
implicitly
trust
when
warned
that
the
ships
had
recently
sailed
from
alexandria
and
that
there
was
imminent
danger
that
the
plague
might
be
communicated
they
replied
we
had
rather
have
the
plague
than
the
austrians
breaking
over
all
the
municipal
regulations
of
health
the
people
took
napoleon
almost
by
violence
hurried
him
over
the
side
of
the
ship
to
the
boats
and
conveyed
him
in
triumph
to
the
shore
the
tidings
had
spread
from
to
with
almost
electric
speed
and
the
whole
country
population
men
women
and
children
were
crowding
down
to
the
shore
even
the
wounded
soldiers
in
the
hospital
left
their
cots
and
crawled
to
the
beach
to
get
a
sight
of
the
hero
the
throng
became
so
great
that
it
was
with
difficulty
that
napoleon
could
land
the
gathering
multitude
however
opened
to
the
right
and
the
left
and
napoleon
passed
through
them
greeted
with
the
enthusiastic
cries
of
long
live
the
conqueror
of
italy
the
conqueror
of
egypt
the
liberator
of
france
the
peaceful
little
harbor
of
frejus
was
suddenly
thrown
into
a
state
of
the
most
unheard
of
excitement
the
bells
rang
their
merriest
peels
the
guns
in
the
forts
rolled
forth
their
heaviest
thunders
over
the
hills
and
over
the
waves
and
the
enthusiastic
shouts
of
the
ever
increasing
multitudes
thronging
napoleon
filled
the
air
the
ships
brought
the
first
tidings
of
the
wonderful
victories
of
mount
tabor
and
of
aboukir
the
french
humiliated
by
defeat
were
exceedingly
elated
by
this
restoration
of
the
national
honor
the
intelligence
of
arrival
was
immediately
communicated
by
telegraph
to
paris
which
was
six
hundred
miles
from
frejus
when
the
tidings
of
napoleon
landing
of
frejus
arrived
in
paris
on
the
evening
of
the
of
october
josephine
was
at
a
large
party
at
the
house
of
gohier
president
of
the
directory
all
the
most
distinguished
men
of
the
metropolis
were
there
the
intelligence
produced
the
most
profound
sensation
some
rioting
in
the
spoils
of
office
turned
pale
with
apprehension
knowing
well
the
genius
of
napoleon
and
his
boundless
popularity
they
feared
another
revolution
which
should
eject
them
from
their
seats
of
power
others
were
elated
with
hope
they
felt
that
providence
had
sent
to
france
a
deliverer
at
the
very
moment
when
a
deliverer
was
needed
one
of
the
deputies
who
had
been
deeply
grieved
at
the
disasters
which
were
overwhelming
the
republic
actually
died
of
joy
when
he
heard
of
napoleon
return
josephine
intensely
excited
by
the
sudden
and
totally
unexpected
announcement
immediately
withdrew
hastened
home
and
at
midnight
without
allowing
an
hour
for
repose
she
entered
her
carriage
with
louis
bonaparte
and
hortense
who
subsequently
became
the
bride
of
louis
and
set
out
to
meet
her
husband
napoleon
almost
at
the
same
hour
with
his
suite
left
frejus
during
every
stop
of
his
progress
he
was
greeted
with
the
most
extraordinary
demonstrations
of
enthusiasm
and
affection
bonfires
blazed
from
the
hills
triumphed
arches
hastily
of
maidens
spread
a
carpet
of
flowers
for
his
chariot
wheels
and
greeted
him
with
smiles
and
choruses
of
welcome
he
carried
at
lyons
in
the
evening
the
whole
city
was
brilliant
with
illuminations
an
immense
concourse
surrounded
him
with
almost
delirious
shouts
of
joy
the
constituted
authorities
received
him
as
he
descended
from
his
carriage
the
major
had
prepared
a
long
and
eulogistic
harangue
for
the
occasion
napoleon
had
no
time
to
listen
to
it
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
imposing
silence
he
said
said
gentlemen
i
learned
that
france
was
in
peril
i
therefore
did
not
hesitate
to
leave
my
army
in
egypt
that
i
might
come
to
he
rescue
i
now
go
hence
in
a
few
days
if
you
think
fit
to
wait
upon
me
i
shall
be
at
leisure
to
hear
you
fresh
horses
were
by
this
time
attached
to
the
carriages
and
the
cavalcade
which
like
a
meteor
had
burst
upon
them
like
a
meteor
disappeared
from
lyons
for
some
unexplained
reason
napoleon
turned
from
the
regular
route
to
paris
and
took
a
less
frequented
road
when
josephine
arrived
at
lyons
to
her
utter
consternation
she
found
that
napoleon
had
left
the
city
several
hours
before
her
arrival
and
that
they
had
passed
each
other
by
different
roads
her
anguish
was
inexpressible
for
many
months
she
had
not
received
a
line
from
her
idolized
husband
all
communication
having
been
intercepted
by
the
english
cruisers
she
knew
that
many
jealous
her
power
had
disseminated
far
and
wide
false
reports
respecting
her
conduct
she
knew
that
these
her
enemies
would
surround
napoleon
immediately
upon
his
arrival
and
take
advantage
of
her
absence
to
inflame
his
mind
against
her
lyons
is
miles
from
paris
josephine
had
passed
over
those
weary
leagues
of
hill
and
dale
pressing
on
without
intermission
by
day
and
by
night
alighting
not
for
refreshment
of
repose
faint
exhausted
and
her
heart
sinking
within
her
with
fearful
apprehensions
of
the
hopeless
alienation
of
her
husband
she
received
the
dreadful
tidings
that
she
had
missed
him
there
was
no
resource
left
her
but
to
retrace
the
steps
with
the
utmost
possible
celerity
napoleon
would
however
have
been
one
or
two
days
in
paris
before
josephine
could
by
any
possibility
the
city
probably
in
all
france
there
was
not
at
that
time
a
more
unhappy
woman
than
josephine
secret
wretchedness
was
also
gnawing
at
the
heart
of
napoleon
who
has
yet
fathomed
the
mystery
of
human
love
intensest
love
and
intensest
hate
can
at
the
same
moment
intertwine
their
fibres
in
inextricable
blending
in
nothing
is
the
will
so
impotent
as
in
guiding
or
checking
the
impulses
of
this
omnipotent
passion
napoleon
loved
josephine
with
that
almost
superhuman
energy
which
characterized
all
the
movements
of
his
impetuous
spirit
the
stream
did
not
fret
and
ripple
over
a
shallow
bed
but
it
was
serene
in
its
unfathomable
depths
the
world
contained
but
two
objects
for
napoleon
glory
and
josephine
glory
first
and
then
closely
following
the
more
substantial
idol
many
of
the
parisian
ladies
proud
of
a
more
exalted
lineage
than
josephine
could
boast
were
exceedingly
envious
of
the
supremacy
she
had
attained
in
consequence
of
the
renown
of
her
husband
her
influence
over
napoleon
was
well
known
philosophers
statesmen
ambitious
generals
all
crowded
her
saloons
paying
her
homage
a
favorable
word
from
josephine
they
knew
would
pave
the
way
for
them
to
fame
and
fortune
thus
josephine
from
the
saloons
of
paris
with
milder
radiance
reflected
back
the
splendor
of
her
husband
she
solicitous
of
securing
as
many
friends
as
possible
to
aid
him
in
future
emergencies
was
as
diligent
in
winning
hearts
at
home
as
napoleon
was
in
conquering
provinces
abroad
the
gracefulness
of
josephine
her
consummate
delicacy
of
moral
appreciation
her
exalted
intellectual
gifts
the
melodious
tones
of
her
winning
voice
charmed
courtiers
philosophers
and
statesmen
alike
her
saloons
were
ever
crowded
her
entertainments
were
ever
embellished
by
the
presence
of
all
who
were
illustrious
in
rank
and
power
in
the
metropolis
and
in
whatever
circles
she
appeared
the
eyes
of
the
gentlemen
first
sought
for
her
two
resistless
attractions
drew
them
she
was
peculiarly
fascinating
in
person
and
in
character
and
through
her
renowned
husband
she
could
dispense
the
most
precious
gifts
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
the
envy
which
must
thus
have
been
excited
many
a
haughty
duchess
was
provoked
almost
beyond
endurance
that
josephine
the
untitled
daughter
of
a
west
indian
planter
should
thus
engross
the
homage
of
paris
while
she
with
her
proud
rank
her
wit
and
her
beauty
was
comparatively
a
cipher
moreau
wife
in
particular
resented
the
supremacy
of
josephine
as
a
personal
affront
she
thought
general
moreau
entitled
to
as
much
consideration
as
general
bonaparte
by
the
jealousy
rankling
in
her
own
bosom
she
finally
succeeded
in
rousing
her
husband
to
conspire
against
napoleon
and
thus
the
hero
of
hohenlinden
was
ruined
some
of
the
brothers
and
sisters
of
napoleon
were
also
jealous
of
the
paramount
influence
of
josephine
and
would
gladly
wrest
a
portion
of
it
from
her
hands
under
these
circumstances
in
various
ways
slander
had
been
warily
insinuated
into
the
ears
of
napoleon
respecting
the
conduct
of
his
wife
conspiring
enemies
became
more
and
more
bold
josephine
was
represented
as
having
forgotten
her
husband
as
reveling
exultant
with
female
vanity
in
general
flirtation
and
finally
as
guilty
of
gross
infidelity
nearly
all
the
letters
written
by
napoleon
and
josephine
to
each
other
were
intercepted
by
the
english
cruisers
though
napoleon
did
not
credit
these
charges
in
full
he
cherished
not
a
little
of
the
pride
which
led
the
roman
monarch
to
exclaim
caesar
wife
must
not
be
suspected
napoleon
was
in
the
troubled
state
of
mind
during
the
latter
months
of
his
residence
in
egypt
one
day
he
was
sitting
alone
in
his
tent
which
was
pitched
in
the
great
arabian
desert
several
months
had
passed
since
he
had
heard
a
word
from
josephine
years
might
elapse
ere
they
would
meet
again
junot
entered
having
just
received
through
some
channel
of
jealousy
and
malignity
communications
from
paris
cautiously
but
fully
he
unfolded
the
whole
budget
of
parisian
gossip
josephine
had
found
as
he
represented
in
the
love
of
others
an
ample
recompense
for
the
absence
of
her
husband
she
was
surrounded
by
admirers
with
whom
she
was
engaged
in
an
incessant
round
of
intrigues
and
flirtations
regardless
of
honor
she
had
surrendered
herself
to
the
dominion
of
passion
napoleon
was
for
a
few
moments
in
a
state
of
terrible
agitation
with
hasty
strides
like
a
chafed
lion
he
paced
his
tent
exclaiming
why
do
i
love
that
woman
so
why
can
i
not
tear
her
image
from
my
heart
i
will
do
so
i
will
have
an
immediate
and
open
and
public
divorce
he
immediately
wrote
to
josephine
in
terms
of
the
utmost
severity
accusing
her
of
playing
the
coquette
with
half
the
world
the
letter
escaped
the
british
cruisers
and
she
received
it
it
almost
broke
her
faithful
heart
such
were
the
circumstances
under
which
napoleon
and
josephine
were
to
meet
after
an
absence
of
eighteen
months
josephine
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
see
napoleon
before
he
should
have
an
interview
with
her
enemies
hence
the
depth
of
anguish
with
which
she
heard
her
husband
had
passes
her
two
or
three
days
must
have
elapse
ere
she
could
possibly
retraced
the
weary
miles
over
which
she
had
already
traveled
in
the
mean
time
the
carriage
of
napoleon
was
rapidly
approaching
the
metropolis
by
night
his
path
was
brilliant
with
bonfires
and
illuminations
the
ringing
of
bells
the
thunders
of
artillery
and
the
acclamations
of
the
multitude
accompanied
him
every
step
of
his
way
but
no
smile
of
triumph
played
upon
his
pale
and
pensive
cheeks
he
felt
that
he
was
returning
to
a
desolated
home
gloom
reigned
in
his
heart
he
entered
paris
and
drove
rapidly
to
his
own
dwelling
behold
josephine
was
not
there
conscious
guilt
he
thought
had
made
her
afraid
to
meet
him
it
is
in
vain
to
attempt
to
penetrate
the
hidden
anguish
of
napoleon
soul
that
his
proud
spirit
must
have
suffered
intensity
of
woe
no
one
can
doubt
the
bitter
enemies
of
josephine
immediately
surrounded
him
eagerly
taking
advantage
of
her
absence
to
inflame
to
a
still
higher
degree
by
adroit
insinuations
his
jealousy
and
anger
eugene
had
accompanied
him
in
his
return
from
egypt
and
his
affectionate
heart
ever
glowed
with
love
and
admiration
for
his
mother
with
anxiety
amounting
to
anguish
he
watched
at
the
window
for
her
arrival
said
one
to
napoleon
maliciously
endeavoring
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
reconciliation
josephine
will
appear
before
you
with
all
her
fascinations
she
will
explain
matters
you
will
forgive
all
and
tranquillity
will
be
restored
never
exclaimed
napoleon
with
pallid
cheek
and
trembling
lip
striding
nervously
too
and
fro
through
the
room
never
i
forgive
ever
then
stopping
suddenly
and
gazing
the
interlocutor
wildly
in
the
face
he
exclaimed
with
passionate
gesticulation
you
know
me
were
i
not
sure
of
my
resolution
i
would
tear
out
this
heart
and
cast
it
into
the
fire
how
strange
is
the
life
of
the
heart
of
man
from
this
interview
napoleon
two
hours
after
his
arrival
in
paris
with
his
whole
soul
agitated
by
the
tumult
of
domestic
woe
went
to
the
palace
of
the
luxembourg
to
visit
the
directory
to
form
his
plans
for
overthrow
the
government
of
france
pale
pensive
joyless
his
inflexible
purposes
of
ambition
wavered
not
his
iron
energies
yielded
not
josephine
was
an
idol
he
execrated
her
and
he
adored
her
he
loved
her
most
passionately
he
hated
her
most
virulently
he
could
clasp
her
one
moment
to
his
bosom
with
burning
kisses
the
next
moment
he
would
spurn
her
from
him
with
as
the
most
loathsome
wretch
but
glory
was
a
still
more
cherished
idol
at
whose
shrine
he
bowed
with
unwavering
adoration
he
strove
to
forget
his
domestic
wretchedness
by
prosecuting
with
new
vigor
his
schemes
of
grandeur
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
of
the
luxembourg
some
of
the
guard
who
had
been
with
him
in
italy
recognized
his
person
and
he
was
instantly
greeted
with
enthusiastic
shouts
long
live
bonaparte
the
clamor
rolled
like
a
voice
of
thunder
through
the
spacious
halls
of
the
palace
and
fell
like
a
death
knell
upon
the
ears
of
the
directors
the
populace
upon
the
pavement
caught
the
sound
and
reechoed
it
from
street
to
street
the
plays
at
the
theatres
and
the
songs
at
the
opera
were
stopped
that
it
might
be
announced
from
the
stage
that
bonaparte
had
arrived
in
paris
men
women
and
children
simultaneously
rose
to
their
feet
and
a
wild
burst
of
enthusiastic
joy
swelled
upon
the
night
air
all
paris
was
in
commotion
the
name
of
bonaparte
was
upon
every
lip
the
enthusiasm
was
contagious
illuminations
began
to
blaze
here
and
there
without
concert
from
the
universal
rejoicing
till
the
whole
city
was
resplendent
with
light
one
bell
rang
forth
its
merry
peal
of
greeting
and
then
another
and
another
till
every
steeple
was
vocal
with
its
clamorous
welcome
one
gun
was
heard
rolling
its
heavy
thunders
over
the
city
it
was
the
signal
for
an
instantaneous
tumultuous
roar
from
artillery
and
musketry
from
all
the
battalions
in
the
metropolis
the
tidings
of
the
great
victories
of
aboukir
and
mount
tabor
reached
paris
with
napoleon
those
oriental
names
were
shouted
through
the
streets
and
blazed
upon
the
eyes
of
the
delighted
people
in
letters
of
light
thus
in
an
hour
the
whole
of
paris
was
thrown
into
a
delirium
of
joy
was
displayed
the
most
triumphant
and
gorgeous
festival
the
government
of
france
was
at
the
time
organized
somewhat
upon
the
model
of
that
the
united
states
instead
of
one
president
they
have
five
called
directors
their
senate
was
called
the
house
of
ancients
their
house
of
representatives
the
council
of
five
hundred
the
five
directors
as
might
have
been
expected
were
ever
quarreling
among
themselves
each
wishing
for
the
lion
share
of
power
the
monarchist
the
jacobin
and
the
moderate
republican
could
not
harmoniously
in
the
government
they
only
circumvented
each
other
while
the
administration
sank
into
disgrace
and
ruin
the
was
decidedly
the
most
able
man
of
the
executive
he
was
a
proud
patrician
and
his
character
may
be
estimated
from
the
following
anecdote
which
napoleon
has
related
respecting
him
the
abbe
before
the
revolution
was
chaplain
to
one
of
the
princesses
one
day
when
he
was
performing
mass
before
herself
her
attendants
and
a
large
congregation
something
occurred
which
rendered
it
necessary
for
the
princess
to
leave
the
room
the
ladies
in
waiting
and
the
nobility
who
attended
church
more
out
of
complaisance
to
her
than
from
any
sense
of
religion
followed
her
example
sieyes
was
very
busy
reading
his
prayers
and
for
a
few
moments
he
did
not
perceive
their
departure
at
last
raising
his
eyes
from
his
book
behold
the
princess
the
nobles
and
all
the
ton
had
disappeared
with
an
air
of
displeasure
and
contempt
he
shut
the
book
and
descended
from
the
pulpit
exclaiming
do
not
read
prayers
for
the
rabble
he
immediately
went
out
of
the
chapel
leaving
the
service
napoleon
arrived
in
paris
on
the
evening
of
the
of
october
two
days
and
two
nights
elapse
ere
josephine
was
able
to
retrace
the
weary
leagues
over
which
she
had
passed
it
was
the
hour
of
midnight
on
the
when
the
rattle
of
her
carriage
wheels
was
heard
entering
the
of
their
dwelling
in
the
rue
chanteraine
eugene
anxiously
awaiting
her
arrival
was
instantly
at
his
mother
side
folding
her
in
his
embrace
napoleon
also
heard
the
arrival
but
he
remained
sternly
in
his
chamber
he
had
ever
been
accustomed
to
greet
josephine
at
the
door
of
her
carriage
even
when
she
returned
from
an
ordinary
morning
ride
no
matter
what
employments
engrossed
his
mind
no
matter
what
guest
were
present
he
would
immediately
leave
every
thing
and
hasten
to
the
door
to
assist
josephine
to
alight
and
to
accompany
her
into
the
house
but
now
after
an
absence
of
eighteen
months
the
faithful
josephine
with
exhaustion
was
at
the
door
and
napoleon
with
pallid
check
and
compressed
lip
and
jealousy
rankling
in
his
bosom
remained
sternly
in
his
room
preparing
to
overwhelm
her
with
his
indignation
josephine
was
in
a
state
of
terrible
agitation
her
limbs
tottered
and
her
heart
throbbed
most
violently
assisted
by
eugene
and
accompanied
by
hortense
she
tremblingly
ascended
the
stairs
to
the
little
parlor
where
she
had
so
often
received
the
caresses
of
her
most
affectionate
spouse
she
opened
the
door
there
stood
napoleon
as
immovable
as
a
statue
leaning
against
the
mantle
with
his
arms
folded
across
his
breast
sternly
and
silently
he
cast
a
withering
look
upon
josephine
and
then
exclaimed
in
tones
which
like
a
dagger
pierced
her
heart
madame
it
is
my
wish
that
you
retire
immediately
to
malmaison
josephine
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
as
if
struck
by
a
mortal
blow
had
she
not
been
caught
in
the
arms
of
her
son
sobbing
bitterly
with
anguish
she
was
conveyed
by
eugene
to
her
own
apartment
napoleon
also
was
dreadfully
agitated
the
sight
of
josephine
had
revived
all
his
passionate
love
but
he
fully
believed
that
josephine
had
unpardonably
trifled
with
his
affections
that
she
had
courted
the
admiration
of
a
multitude
of
flatterers
and
that
she
had
degraded
herself
and
her
husband
by
playing
the
coquette
the
proud
spirit
of
napoleon
could
not
brook
such
a
requital
for
his
fervid
love
with
hasty
strides
he
traversed
the
room
striving
to
nourish
his
indignation
the
sobs
of
josephine
had
deeply
moved
him
he
yearned
to
fold
her
again
in
fond
love
to
his
heart
but
he
proudly
resolved
that
he
would
not
relent
josephine
with
that
prompt
obedience
which
ever
characterized
her
prepared
immediately
to
comply
with
his
orders
it
was
midnight
for
a
week
she
had
lived
in
her
carriage
almost
without
food
or
sleep
malmaison
was
thirty
miles
from
paris
napoleon
did
not
suppose
that
she
would
leave
the
house
until
morning
much
to
his
surprise
in
a
few
moments
he
heard
josephine
eugene
and
hortense
descending
the
stairs
to
take
the
carriage
napoleon
even
in
his
anger
could
not
be
thus
inhuman
my
heart
he
said
was
never
formed
to
witness
tears
without
emotion
he
immediately
descended
to
the
though
his
pride
would
not
yet
allow
him
to
speak
to
josephine
he
however
addressing
eugene
urged
the
party
to
return
and
obtain
refreshment
and
repose
josephine
all
submission
unhesitatingly
yielded
to
his
wishes
and
the
stairs
in
the
extremity
of
exhaustion
and
grief
threw
herself
upon
a
couch
in
her
apartment
napoleon
equally
wretched
returned
to
his
cabinet
two
days
of
utter
misery
passed
away
during
which
no
intercourse
took
place
between
the
estranged
parties
each
of
whom
loved
the
other
with
almost
superhuman
intensity
love
in
the
heart
will
finally
triumph
over
all
obstructions
the
struggle
was
long
but
gradually
pride
and
passion
yielded
and
love
regained
the
ascendency
napoleon
so
far
surrendered
on
the
third
day
as
to
enter
the
apartment
of
josephine
she
was
seated
at
a
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
and
absorbed
in
the
profoundest
woe
the
letters
which
she
had
received
from
napoleon
and
which
she
had
evidently
been
reading
were
spread
upon
the
table
hortense
the
picture
of
grief
and
despair
was
standing
in
the
alcove
of
a
window
napoleon
had
opened
the
door
softly
and
his
entrance
had
not
been
heard
with
an
irresolute
step
he
advanced
toward
his
wife
and
then
said
kindly
and
sadly
josephine
she
started
at
the
sound
of
that
voice
and
raising
her
swollen
eyes
swimming
in
tears
mournfully
exclaimed
monami
my
friend
this
was
the
term
of
endearment
with
which
she
had
invariably
addressed
her
husband
it
recalled
a
thousand
delightful
reminiscences
napoleon
was
vanquished
he
extended
his
hand
josephine
threw
herself
into
his
arms
pillowed
her
aching
head
upon
his
bosom
and
in
the
intensity
of
blended
joy
and
anguish
wept
convulsively
a
long
explanation
ensued
napoleon
became
satisfied
that
josephine
had
been
deeply
wronged
the
reconciliation
was
cordial
and
entire
and
was
never
again
interrupted
napoleon
now
with
a
stronger
heart
turned
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
designs
to
rescue
france
from
anarchy
he
was
fully
conscious
of
his
own
ability
to
govern
the
nation
he
knew
that
it
was
the
almost
unanimous
wish
of
the
people
that
he
should
grasp
the
reins
of
power
he
was
confident
of
their
cordial
in
any
plans
he
might
adopt
still
it
was
an
enterprise
of
no
small
difficulty
to
thrust
the
five
directors
from
their
thrones
and
to
get
the
control
of
the
council
of
ancients
and
of
the
five
hundred
never
was
a
difficult
achievement
more
adroitly
and
proudly
accomplished
for
many
days
napoleon
almost
entirely
secluded
himself
from
observation
affecting
a
studious
avoidance
of
the
public
gaze
he
laid
aside
his
military
dress
and
assumed
the
peaceful
costume
of
the
national
institute
occasionally
he
wore
a
beautiful
turkish
sabre
suspended
by
a
silk
ribbon
this
simple
dress
transported
the
imagination
of
the
beholder
to
aboukir
mount
tabor
and
the
pyramids
he
studiously
sought
the
society
of
literary
men
and
devoted
to
them
his
attention
he
invited
distinguished
men
of
the
institute
to
dine
with
him
and
avoiding
political
discussion
conversed
only
upon
literary
and
scientific
subjects
moreau
and
bernadotte
were
the
two
rival
generals
from
whom
napoleon
had
the
most
to
fear
two
days
after
his
arrival
in
paris
napoleon
said
to
bourrienne
i
believe
that
i
shall
have
bernadotte
and
moreau
against
me
but
i
do
not
fear
moreau
he
is
devoid
of
energy
he
prefers
military
to
political
power
we
shall
gain
him
by
the
promise
of
a
command
but
bernadotte
has
moorish
blood
in
his
veins
he
is
bold
and
enterprising
he
does
not
like
me
and
i
am
certain
that
he
will
oppose
me
if
he
should
become
ambitious
he
will
venture
anything
besides
this
fellow
is
not
to
be
seduced
he
is
disinterested
and
clever
but
after
all
we
have
just
arrived
we
shall
see
napoleon
formed
no
conspiracy
he
confided
to
no
one
his
designs
and
yet
in
his
own
solitary
mind
relying
entirely
upon
his
own
capacious
resources
he
studied
the
state
of
affairs
and
he
matured
his
plans
sieyes
was
the
only
one
whose
talents
and
influence
napoleon
feared
the
abbe
also
looked
with
apprehension
upon
his
formidable
rival
they
stood
aloof
and
eyed
each
other
meeting
at
a
dinner
party
each
was
too
proud
to
make
advances
yet
each
thought
only
of
the
other
mutually
exasperated
they
separated
without
having
spoken
did
you
see
that
insolent
little
fellow
said
sieyes
he
would
not
even
condescend
to
notice
a
member
of
the
government
who
if
they
had
done
right
would
have
caused
him
to
be
shot
what
on
earth
said
napoleon
could
have
induced
them
to
put
that
priest
in
the
directory
he
is
sold
to
prussia
unless
you
take
care
he
will
deliver
you
up
to
that
power
napoleon
dined
with
moreau
who
afterward
in
hostility
to
napoleon
pointed
the
guns
of
russia
against
the
columns
of
his
countrymen
the
dinner
party
was
at
gohier
one
of
the
directors
the
following
interesting
conversation
took
place
between
the
rival
generals
when
first
introduced
they
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
without
speaking
napoleon
conscious
of
his
own
superiority
and
solicitous
to
gain
the
powerful
of
moreau
made
the
first
advances
and
with
great
courtesy
expressed
the
earnest
desire
he
felt
to
make
his
acquaintance
you
have
returned
victorious
from
egypt
replied
moreau
and
i
from
italy
after
a
great
defeat
it
was
the
month
which
general
joubert
passed
in
pairs
after
his
marriage
which
caused
our
disasters
this
gave
the
allies
time
to
reduce
mantua
and
to
bring
up
the
force
which
besieged
it
to
take
a
part
in
the
action
it
is
always
the
greater
number
which
defeats
the
less
true
replied
napoleon
it
is
always
the
greater
number
which
beats
the
less
and
yet
said
gohier
with
small
armies
you
have
frequently
defeated
large
ones
even
then
rejoined
napoleon
it
was
always
the
inferior
force
which
was
defeated
by
the
superior
when
with
a
small
body
of
men
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
large
one
collecting
my
little
band
i
fell
like
lightning
on
one
of
the
wings
of
the
hostile
army
and
defeated
it
profiting
by
the
disorder
which
such
an
event
never
failed
to
occasion
in
their
whole
line
i
repeated
the
attack
with
similar
success
in
another
quarter
still
with
my
whole
force
i
thus
beat
it
in
detail
the
general
victory
which
was
the
result
was
still
an
example
of
the
truth
of
the
principle
that
the
greater
force
defeats
the
lesser
napoleon
by
those
fascinations
of
mind
and
manner
which
enabled
him
to
win
to
him
whom
he
would
soon
gained
an
ascendency
over
moreau
and
when
two
days
after
in
token
of
his
regard
he
sent
him
a
beautiful
poniard
set
with
diamonds
worth
two
thousand
dollars
the
work
was
accomplished
and
moreau
was
ready
to
do
his
bidding
napoleon
gave
a
small
and
very
select
dinner
party
gohier
was
invited
the
conversation
turned
on
the
turquoise
used
by
the
orientals
to
clasp
their
turbans
napoleon
rising
from
the
table
took
from
a
private
drawer
two
very
beautiful
brooches
richly
set
with
those
jewels
one
he
gave
to
gohier
the
other
to
his
tried
friend
desaix
it
is
a
little
toy
said
he
which
we
republicans
may
give
and
receive
without
impropriety
the
director
flattered
by
the
delicacy
of
the
compliment
and
yet
not
repelled
by
any
thing
assuming
the
grossness
of
a
bribe
yielded
his
heart
homage
to
napoleon
republican
france
was
surrounded
by
monarchies
in
arms
against
her
their
hostility
was
so
inveterate
and
from
the
very
nature
of
the
case
so
inevitable
that
napoleon
thought
that
france
should
ever
be
prepared
for
an
attack
and
that
the
military
spirit
should
be
carefully
fostered
republican
america
most
happily
has
no
foe
to
fear
and
all
her
energies
may
be
devoted
to
filling
the
land
with
peace
and
plenty
but
a
republic
in
monarchical
europe
must
sleep
by
the
side
of
its
guns
do
you
really
said
napoleon
to
gohier
in
this
interview
advocate
a
general
peace
you
are
wrong
the
republic
should
never
make
but
partial
accommodations
it
should
always
contrive
to
have
some
war
on
hand
to
keep
alive
the
military
spirit
we
can
perhaps
find
a
little
extenuation
for
this
remark
in
its
apparent
necessity
and
in
the
influences
of
the
martial
ardor
in
which
napoleon
from
his
very
infancy
had
been
enveloped
even
now
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
time
is
far
distant
ere
the
nations
of
the
earth
can
learn
war
no
more
lefebvre
was
commandant
of
the
guard
of
the
two
legislative
bodies
his
was
important
napoleon
sent
a
special
invitation
for
an
interview
lefebvre
said
he
will
you
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
republic
suffer
it
to
perish
in
the
hands
of
these
lawyers
join
me
and
assist
to
save
it
taking
from
his
own
side
the
beautiful
turkish
scimitar
which
he
wore
he
passed
the
ribbon
over
lefebvre
neck
saying
accept
this
sword
which
i
wore
at
the
battle
of
the
pyramids
i
give
it
to
you
as
a
token
of
my
esteem
and
confidence
yes
replied
lefebvre
most
highly
gratified
at
this
signal
mark
of
confidence
and
generosity
let
us
throw
the
lawyers
into
the
river
napoleon
soon
had
an
interview
with
bernadotte
he
confessed
said
napoleon
to
bourrienne
that
he
thought
us
all
lost
he
spoke
of
external
enemies
of
internal
enemies
and
at
that
word
he
looked
steadily
in
my
face
i
also
gave
him
a
glance
but
patience
the
pear
will
soon
be
ripe
in
this
interview
napoleon
inveighed
against
the
violence
and
lawlessness
of
the
jacobin
club
your
own
brothers
bernadotte
replied
were
the
founders
of
that
club
and
yet
you
reproach
me
with
favoring
its
principles
it
is
to
the
instructions
of
some
one
i
know
not
who
that
we
are
to
ascribe
the
agitation
which
now
prevails
true
general
napoleon
replied
most
vehemently
and
i
would
rather
live
in
the
woods
than
in
a
society
which
presents
no
security
against
violence
this
conversation
only
strengthened
the
alienation
already
existing
between
them
bernadotte
though
a
brave
and
efficient
officer
was
a
jealous
braggadocio
at
the
first
interview
between
these
two
distinguished
men
when
napoleon
was
in
command
of
the
army
of
italy
they
contemplated
each
other
with
mutual
dislike
i
have
seen
a
man
said
bernadotte
of
or
seven
years
of
age
who
assumes
the
air
of
one
of
fifty
and
he
presages
any
thing
but
good
to
the
republic
napoleon
summarily
dismissed
bernadotte
by
saying
he
has
a
french
head
and
a
roman
heart
there
were
three
political
parties
now
dividing
france
the
old
royalist
party
in
favor
of
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
the
radical
democrats
or
jacobins
with
barras
at
its
head
supported
by
the
mob
of
paris
and
the
moderate
republicans
led
by
sieyes
all
these
parties
struggling
together
and
fearing
each
other
in
the
midst
of
the
general
anarchy
which
prevailed
immediately
paid
court
to
napoleon
hoping
to
secure
the
support
of
his
arm
napoleon
determined
to
with
the
moderate
republicans
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
was
not
only
out
of
the
question
but
napoleon
had
no
more
power
to
secure
that
result
than
had
washington
to
bring
the
united
states
into
peaceful
submission
to
george
iii
had
i
joined
the
jacobins
said
napoleon
i
should
have
risked
nothing
but
after
conquering
with
them
it
would
have
been
necessary
almost
immediately
to
conquer
against
them
a
club
can
not
endure
a
permanent
chief
it
wants
one
for
every
successive
passion
now
to
make
use
of
a
party
one
day
in
order
to
attack
it
the
next
under
whatever
pretext
it
is
done
is
still
an
act
of
treachery
it
was
inconsistent
with
my
principles
sieyes
the
head
of
the
moderate
republicans
and
napoleon
soon
understood
each
other
and
each
admitted
the
necessity
of
the
government
was
in
a
state
of
chaos
our
salvation
now
demands
said
the
wily
diplomatist
both
a
head
and
a
sword
napoleon
had
both
in
one
fortnight
from
the
time
when
he
landed
at
frejus
the
pear
was
ripe
the
plan
was
all
matured
for
the
great
conflict
napoleon
in
solitary
grandeur
kept
his
own
counsel
he
had
secured
the
cordial
the
unquestioning
obedience
of
all
his
subordinates
like
the
general
upon
the
field
of
battle
he
was
simply
to
give
his
orders
and
columns
marched
and
squadrons
charged
and
generals
swept
the
field
in
unquestioning
obedience
though
he
had
determined
to
ride
over
and
to
destroy
the
existing
government
he
wished
to
avail
himself
so
far
as
possible
of
the
mysterious
power
of
law
as
a
conqueror
turns
a
captured
battery
upon
the
foe
from
whom
it
had
been
wrested
such
a
plot
so
simple
yet
so
bold
and
efficient
was
never
formed
before
and
no
one
but
another
napoleon
will
be
able
to
execute
another
such
again
all
paris
was
in
a
state
of
intense
excitement
something
great
was
to
be
done
napoleon
was
to
do
it
but
nobody
knew
when
or
what
or
how
all
impatiently
awaited
orders
the
majority
of
the
senate
or
council
of
ancients
conservative
in
its
tendencies
and
having
once
seen
during
the
reign
of
terror
the
horrors
of
jacobin
domination
were
ready
most
obsequiously
to
rally
beneath
the
banner
of
so
resolute
a
leader
as
napoleon
they
were
prepared
without
question
to
pass
any
vote
which
he
should
propose
the
house
of
representatives
or
council
of
five
hundred
more
democratic
in
its
constitution
contained
a
large
number
of
vulgar
ignorant
and
passionate
demagogues
struggling
to
grasp
the
reins
of
power
carnot
whose
napoleon
had
entirely
secured
was
president
of
the
senate
lucien
bonaparte
the
brother
of
napoleon
was
speaker
of
the
house
the
two
bodies
met
in
the
palace
of
the
tuileries
the
constitution
conferred
upon
the
council
of
ancients
the
right
to
decide
upon
the
place
of
meeting
for
both
legislative
assemblies
all
the
officers
of
the
garrison
in
paris
and
all
the
distinguished
military
men
in
the
metropolis
had
solicited
the
honor
of
a
presentation
to
napoleon
without
any
public
announcement
each
one
was
privately
informed
that
napoleon
would
see
him
on
the
morning
of
the
of
november
all
the
regiments
in
the
city
had
also
solicited
the
honor
of
a
review
by
the
distinguished
conqueror
they
were
also
informed
that
napoleon
would
review
them
early
on
the
morning
of
the
of
november
the
council
of
ancients
was
called
to
convene
at
six
on
the
morning
of
the
same
day
the
council
of
five
hundred
were
also
to
convene
at
of
the
same
morning
this
the
famous
of
brumaire
was
the
destined
day
for
the
commencement
of
the
great
struggle
these
appointments
were
given
in
such
a
way
as
to
attract
no
public
attention
the
was
thus
silently
arranging
his
forces
for
the
important
conflict
to
none
did
he
reveal
those
combinations
by
which
he
anticipated
a
bloodless
victory
the
morning
of
the
of
november
arrived
the
sun
rose
with
unwonted
splendor
over
the
domes
of
the
thronged
city
a
more
brilliant
day
never
dawned
through
all
the
streets
of
the
mammoth
metropolis
there
was
heard
in
the
earliest
twilight
of
the
day
the
music
of
martial
bands
the
tramp
of
battalions
the
clatter
of
iron
hoofs
and
the
rumbling
of
heavy
artillery
wheels
over
the
pavements
as
regiments
of
infantry
artillery
and
cavlary
in
the
proudest
array
marched
to
the
boulevards
to
receive
the
honor
of
a
review
from
the
conqueror
of
italy
and
of
egypt
the
whole
city
was
in
commotion
guided
by
the
unseen
energies
of
napoleon
in
the
retirement
of
his
closet
at
eight
napoleon
house
in
the
rue
chanteraine
was
so
thronged
with
illustrious
military
men
in
most
brilliant
uniform
that
every
room
was
filled
and
even
the
street
was
crowded
with
the
resplendent
guests
at
that
moment
the
council
of
ancients
passed
the
decree
which
napoleon
had
prepared
that
the
two
legislative
bodies
should
transfer
their
meeting
to
st
cloud
a
few
miles
from
paris
and
that
napoleon
bonaparte
should
be
put
in
command
of
all
the
military
forces
in
the
city
to
secure
the
public
peace
the
removal
to
st
cloud
was
a
merciful
precaution
against
bloodshed
it
secured
the
legislatures
from
the
ferocious
interference
of
a
parisian
mob
the
president
of
the
council
was
himself
commissioned
to
bear
the
decree
to
napoleon
he
elbowed
his
way
through
the
brilliant
throng
crowding
the
door
and
the
apartment
of
napoleon
dwelling
and
presented
to
him
the
ordinance
napoleon
was
ready
to
receive
it
he
stepped
upon
the
balcony
gathered
his
vast
retinue
of
powerful
guests
before
him
and
in
a
loud
and
firm
voice
read
to
them
the
decree
gentlemen
said
he
will
you
help
me
save
the
republic
one
simultaneous
burst
of
enthusiasm
rose
from
every
lip
as
drawing
their
swords
from
their
scabbards
they
waved
them
in
the
air
and
shouted
we
swear
it
we
swear
it
the
victory
was
virtually
won
napoleon
was
now
at
the
head
of
the
french
nation
nothing
remained
but
to
finish
his
conquest
there
was
no
retreat
left
open
for
his
foes
there
was
hardly
the
possibility
of
a
rally
and
now
napoleon
summoned
all
his
energies
to
make
his
triumph
most
illustrious
messengers
were
immediately
sent
to
read
the
decree
to
the
troops
already
assembled
in
the
utmost
display
of
martial
pomp
to
greet
the
idol
of
the
army
and
who
were
in
a
state
of
mind
to
welcome
him
most
exultingly
as
their
chief
a
burst
of
enthusiastic
acclamation
ascended
from
their
ranks
which
almost
rent
the
skies
napoleon
immediately
mounted
his
horse
and
surrounded
by
the
most
magnificent
staff
whom
he
had
thus
ingeniously
assembled
at
his
house
and
accompanied
by
a
body
of
fifteen
hundred
cavalry
whom
he
had
taken
the
precaution
to
rendezvous
near
his
dwelling
proceeded
to
the
palace
of
the
tuileries
the
gorgeous
spectacle
burst
like
a
vision
upon
astonished
paris
it
was
napoleon
first
public
appearance
dressed
in
the
utmost
simplicity
of
a
civilian
costume
he
rode
upon
his
magnificent
charger
the
centre
of
all
eyes
the
gleaming
banners
waving
in
the
breeze
and
the
gorgeous
trappings
of
silver
and
gold
with
which
his
retinue
was
embellished
set
off
in
stronger
relief
the
majestic
simplicity
of
his
own
appearance
with
the
pump
and
the
authority
of
an
enthroned
king
napoleon
entered
the
council
of
the
ancients
the
ancients
themselves
were
dazzled
by
his
sudden
apparition
in
such
imposing
and
unexpected
splendor
and
power
ascending
the
bar
attended
by
an
imposing
escort
he
addressed
the
assembly
and
took
his
oath
of
office
you
said
napoleon
are
the
wisdom
of
the
nation
to
you
it
belongs
to
concert
measures
for
the
salvation
of
the
republic
i
come
surrounded
by
our
generals
to
offer
you
support
faithfully
will
i
fulfill
the
task
you
have
intrusted
to
me
let
us
not
look
into
the
pass
for
precedents
nothing
in
history
resembles
the
eighteenth
century
nothing
in
the
eighteenth
century
resembles
the
present
moment
an
aid
was
immediately
sent
to
the
palace
of
the
luxembourg
to
inform
the
five
directors
there
in
session
of
the
decree
two
of
the
directors
sieyes
and
ducos
were
pledged
to
napoleon
and
immediately
resigned
their
offices
and
hastened
to
the
tuileries
barras
bewildered
and
indignant
sent
his
secretary
with
a
remonstrance
napoleon
already
assuming
the
authority
of
an
emperor
and
speaking
as
if
france
were
his
patrimony
came
down
upon
him
with
a
torrent
of
invective
where
he
indignantly
exclaimed
is
that
beautiful
france
which
i
left
you
so
brilliant
i
left
you
peace
i
find
war
i
left
you
victories
i
find
but
defeats
i
left
you
millions
of
italy
i
find
taxation
and
beggary
where
are
the
hundred
thousand
men
my
companions
in
glory
they
are
dead
this
state
of
things
can
not
continue
it
will
lead
to
despotism
barras
was
terrified
he
feared
to
have
napoleon
eagle
eye
investigate
his
peculations
he
resigned
two
directors
only
now
were
left
gohier
and
moulins
it
took
a
majority
of
the
five
to
constitute
a
quorum
the
two
were
powerless
in
despair
of
successful
resistance
and
fearing
vengeance
they
hastened
to
the
tuileries
to
find
napoleon
they
were
introduced
to
him
surrounded
by
sieyes
ducos
and
a
brilliant
staff
napoleon
received
them
cordially
i
am
glad
to
see
you
said
he
i
doubt
not
that
you
will
both
sign
your
patriotism
will
not
allow
you
to
appose
a
revolution
which
is
both
inevitable
and
necessary
i
do
not
yet
despair
said
gohier
vehemently
aided
by
my
colleage
moulins
of
saving
the
republic
with
what
will
you
save
it
exclaimed
napoleon
with
the
constitution
which
is
crumbling
to
pieces
just
at
that
moment
a
messenger
came
in
and
informed
the
directors
that
santeree
the
brewer
who
during
the
reign
of
terror
had
obtained
a
bloody
celebrity
as
leader
of
the
jacobins
was
rousing
the
mob
in
the
faubourgs
to
resistance
general
moulins
said
napoleon
firmly
you
are
the
friend
of
santerre
tell
him
that
at
the
very
first
movement
he
makes
i
will
cause
him
to
be
shot
moulins
exasperated
yet
appalled
made
an
apologetic
reply
the
republic
is
in
danger
said
napoleon
we
must
save
it
it
is
my
will
sieyes
ducos
and
barras
have
resigned
you
are
two
individuals
insulated
and
powerless
i
advise
you
not
to
resist
they
still
refused
napoleon
had
no
time
to
spend
in
parleying
he
immediately
sent
them
both
back
into
the
luxembourg
separated
them
and
placed
them
under
arrest
fouche
occupying
the
important
post
of
minister
of
police
though
not
in
napoleon
confidence
yet
anxious
to
display
his
homage
to
the
rising
luminary
called
upon
napoleon
and
informed
him
that
he
had
closed
the
barriers
and
had
thus
prevented
all
ingress
or
egress
what
means
this
folly
said
napoleon
let
those
orders
be
instantly
countermanded
do
we
not
march
with
the
opinion
of
the
nation
and
by
its
strength
alone
let
no
citizen
be
interrupted
let
every
publicity
be
given
to
what
is
done
fouche
said
napoleon
is
a
miscreant
of
all
colors
a
terrorist
and
one
who
took
an
active
part
in
many
bloody
scenes
of
the
revolution
he
is
a
man
who
can
worm
all
your
secrets
out
of
you
with
an
air
of
calmness
and
unconcern
he
is
very
rich
but
his
riches
have
been
badly
acquired
he
never
was
my
confidant
never
did
he
approach
me
without
bending
to
the
ground
but
i
never
had
any
esteem
for
him
i
employed
him
merely
as
an
instrument
the
council
of
five
hundred
in
great
confusion
and
bewilderment
assembled
at
eleven
lucien
immediately
communicated
the
degree
transferring
their
session
to
st
cloud
this
cut
off
all
debate
the
decree
was
perfectly
legal
there
could
therefore
be
no
legal
pretext
for
opposition
napoleon
the
idol
of
the
army
had
the
whole
military
power
obedient
to
his
nod
therefore
resistance
of
any
kind
was
worse
than
folly
the
deed
was
adroitly
done
at
eleven
the
day
work
was
accomplished
there
was
no
longer
a
directory
napoleon
was
the
appointed
chief
of
the
troops
and
they
were
filling
the
streets
with
enthusiastic
shouts
of
live
napoleon
the
council
of
ancients
were
entirely
at
his
disposal
an
a
large
party
in
the
council
of
five
hundred
were
also
wholly
subservient
to
his
will
napoleon
proud
silent
reserved
reserved
fully
conscious
of
his
own
intellectual
supremacy
and
regarding
the
generals
the
statesmen
and
the
multitude
around
him
as
a
man
contemplates
children
ascended
the
grand
staircase
of
the
tuileries
as
it
were
his
hereditary
home
nearly
all
parties
united
to
sustain
his
triumph
napoleon
was
a
solider
the
guns
of
paris
joyfully
thundered
forth
the
victory
of
one
who
seemed
the
peculiar
favorite
of
the
god
of
war
napoleon
was
a
scholar
stimulating
intellect
to
its
mightiest
achievements
the
scholars
of
paris
gratefully
united
to
weave
a
chaplet
for
the
brow
of
their
honored
associate
and
patron
napoleon
was
for
those
days
of
profligacy
and
unbridled
lust
a
model
of
purity
of
morals
and
of
irreproachable
integrity
the
proffered
bribe
of
millions
could
not
tempt
him
the
dancing
daughters
of
herodias
with
all
their
blandishments
could
not
lure
him
from
his
life
of
herculean
toil
and
from
his
majestic
patriotism
the
wine
which
glitters
in
the
cup
never
vanquished
him
at
the
shrine
of
no
vice
was
he
found
a
worshiper
the
purest
and
the
best
in
france
disgusted
with
that
gilded
corruption
which
had
converted
the
palaces
of
the
bourbons
into
harems
of
voluptuous
sin
and
still
more
deeply
loathing
that
vulgar
and
revolting
vice
which
had
transformed
paris
into
a
house
of
infamy
enlisted
all
their
sympathies
in
behalf
of
the
exemplary
husband
and
the
incorruptible
patriot
napoleon
was
one
of
the
most
firm
and
unflinching
friends
of
law
and
order
france
was
weary
of
anarchy
and
was
trembling
under
the
apprehension
that
the
gutters
of
the
guillotine
were
again
to
be
clotted
with
blood
and
mothers
and
maidens
prayed
for
god
blessing
upon
napoleon
who
appeared
to
them
as
a
messenger
sent
from
heaven
for
their
protection
during
the
afternoon
and
the
night
his
room
at
the
tuileries
was
thronged
with
the
most
illustrious
statesmen
generals
and
scholars
of
paris
hastening
to
pledge
to
him
their
support
napoleon
perfectly
unembarrassed
and
never
at
a
loss
in
any
emergency
gave
his
orders
for
the
ensuing
day
lannes
was
intrusted
with
a
body
of
troops
to
guard
the
tuileries
murat
who
said
napoleon
was
superb
at
aboukir
with
a
numerous
cavalry
and
a
crops
of
grenadiers
was
stationed
at
st
cloud
a
thunderbolt
in
right
hand
woe
betide
the
mob
into
whose
ranks
that
thunderbolt
may
be
hurled
moreau
with
five
hundred
men

stationed
to
guard
the
luxembourg
where
the
two
refractory
directors
were
held
under
arrest
serrurier
was
posted
in
a
commanding
position
with
a
strong
reserve
prompt
for
any
unexpected
exigence
even
a
body
of
troops
were
sent
to
accompany
barras
to
his
country
seat
ostensibly
as
an
escort
of
honor
but
in
reality
to
guard
against
any
change
in
that
venal
and
versatile
mind
the
most
energetic
measures
were
immediately
adopted
to
prevent
any
rallying
point
for
the
disaffected
bills
were
everywhere
posted
exhorting
the
citizens
to
be
quiet
and
assuring
them
that
powerful
efforts
were
making
to
save
the
republic
these
minute
precaution
were
characteristic
of
napoleon
he
believed
in
destiny
yet
he
left
nothing
for
destiny
to
accomplish
he
ever
sought
to
make
provision
for
all
conceivable
contingencies
these
measures
were
completely
successful
though
paris
was
in
a
delirium
of
excitement
there
were
outbreaks
of
lawless
violence
neither
monarchist
republican
nor
jacobin
knew
what
napoleon
intended
to
do
all
were
conscious
that
he
would
do
something
it
was
known
that
the
jacobin
party
in
the
council
of
five
hundred
on
the
ensuing
day
would
make
a
desperate
effort
at
resistance
sieyes
perfectly
acquainted
with
revolutionary
movements
urged
napoleon
to
arrest
some
forty
of
the
jacobins
most
prominent
in
the
council
this
would
have
secured
an
easy
victory
on
the
morrow

however
rejected
the
advice
saying
i
pledged
my
word
this
morning
to
protect
the
national
representation
i
will
not
this
evening
violate
my
oath
had
the
assembly
been
convened
in
paris
all
the
mob
of
the
faubourgs
would
have
risen
like
an
inundation
in
their
behalf
and
torrents
of
blood
must
have
been
shed
the
sagacious
transferrence
of
the
meeting
to
st
cloud
several
miles
from
paris
saved
those
lives
the
powerful
military
display
checked
any
attempt
at
a
march
upon
st
cloud
what
could
the
mob
do
with
murat
lannes
and
serrurier
guided
by
the
energies
of
napoleon
ready
to
hurl
their
solid
columns
upon
them
the
delicacy
of
attention
with
which
napoleon
treated
josephine
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
traits
in
his
character
it
is
not
strange
that
he
should
have
won
from
her
a
love
almost
more
than
human
during
the
exciting
scenes
of
this
day
when
no
one
could
tell
whether
events
were
guiding
him
to
a
crown
or
to
the
guillotine
napoleon
did
not
forget
his
wife
who
was
awaiting
the
result
with
deep
solicitude
in
her
chamber
in
the
rue
chanteraine
nearly
every
hour
he
dispatched
a
messenger
to
josephine
with
a
hastily
written
line
communicating
to
her
the
progress
of
events
late
at
night
he
returned
to
his
home
apparently
has
fresh
and
unexhausted
as
in
the
morning
he
informed
josephine
minutely
of
the
scenes
of
the
day
and
then
threw
himself
upon
a
sofa
for
an
hour
repose
early
the
next
morning
he
was
on
horseback
accompanied
by
a
regal
retinue
directing
his
steps
to
st
cloud
three
halls
had
been
prepared
in
the
palace
one
for
the
ancients
one
for
the
five
hundred
and
one
for
napoleon
he
thus
assumed
the
position
which
he
knew
it
to
be
the
almost
unanimous
will
of
the
nation
that
he
should
fill
during
the
night
the
jacobins
had
arranged
a
very
formidable
resistance
napoleon
was
considered
to
be
in
imminent
peril
he
would
be
denounced
as
a
traitor
sieyes
and
ducos
had
each
a
and
six
horses
waiting
at
the
gate
of
st
cloud
prepared
in
case
of
reverse
to
escape
for
life
there
were
many
ambitious
generals
ready
to
mount
the
crest
of
any
refluent
wave
to
sweep
napoleon
to
destruction
benadotte
was
the
most
to
be
feared
orders
were
given
to
cut
down
the
first
person
who
should
attempt
to
harangue
the
troops
napoleon
riding
at
the
head
of
this
imposing
military
display
manifested
no
agitation
he
knew
however
perfectly
well
the
capriciousness
of
the
popular
voice
and
that
the
multitude
in
the
same
hour
could
cry
hosanna
and
crucify
the
two
councils
met
the
tumult
in
the
five
hundred
was
fearful
cries
of
down
with
the
dictator
death
to
the
tyrant
live
the
constitution
filled
the
hall
and
drowned
the
voice
of
deliberation
the
friends
of
napoleon
were
swept
before
the
flood
of
passion
it
was
proposed
that
every
member
should
immediately
take
anew
the
oath
to
support
the
constitution
no
one
dared
to
peril
his
life
by
the
refusal
even
lucien
the
speaker
was
compelled
to
descend
from
his
chair
and
take
the
oath
the
ancients
overawed
by
the
unexpected
violence
of
this
opposition
in
the
lower
and
more
popular
house
began
to
be
alarmed
and
to
recede
the
opposition
took
a
bold
and
aggressive
stand
and
proposed
a
decree
of
outlawry
against
napoleon
the
friends
of
napoleon
remembering
past
scenes
of
earnage
were
timid
and
yielding
defeat
seemed
inevitable
victory
was
apparently
turned
into
discomfiture
and
death
in
this
emergency
napoleon
displayed
the
same
coolness
energy
and
tact
with
which
so
often
on
the
field
of
battle
in
the
most
disastrous
hour
he
had
rolled
back
the
tide
of
defeat
in
the
resplendent
waves
of
victory
his
own
mind
was
the
corps
de
reserve
which
he
now
marched
into
the
conflict
to
arrest
the
rout
of
his
friends
taking
with
him
a
few
aids
and
a
band
of
grenadiers
he
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
hall
on
his
way
he
met
bernadotte
you
are
marching
to
the
guillotine
said
his
rival
sternly
we
shall
see
napoleon
coolly
replied
leaving
the
soldiers
with
their
glittering
steel
and
nodding
plumes
at
the
entrance
of
the
room
he
ascended
the
tribune
the
hush
of
perfect
silence
pervaded
the
agitated
hall
gentlemen
said
he
you
are
on
a
volcano
you
deemed
the
republic
in
danger
you
called
me
to
your
aid
i
obeyed
and
now
i
am
assailed
by
a
thousand
calumnies
they
talk
of
caesar
of
cromwell
of
military
despotism
as
if
any
thing
in
antiquity
resembled
the
present
moment
danger
presses
disaster
thickens
we
have
no
longer
a
government
the
directors
have
resigned
the
five
hundred
are
in
a
tumult
emissaries
are
instigating
paris
to
revolt
agitators
would
gladly
bring
back
the
revolutionary
tribunals
but
fear
not
aided
by
my
companions
in
arms
i
will
protect
you
i
desire
nothing
for
myself
but
to
save
the
republic
and
i
solemnly
swear
to
protect
that
liberty
and
equality
for
which
we
have
made
such
sacrifices
and
the
constitution
some
one
cried
out
napoleon
had
purposely
omitted
the
constitution
in
his
oath
for
he
despised
it
and
was
at
that
moment
laboring
for
its
overthrow
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
with
increasing
energy
exclaimed
the
institution
you
have
none
you
violated
when
the
executive
infringed
the
rights
of
the
legislature
you
violated
it
when
the
legislature
struck
at
the
independence
of
the
executive
you
violated
it
when
with
sacriligious
hand
both
the
legislature
and
executive
struck
at
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
by
annulling
their
elections
the
constitution
it
is
a
mockery
invoked
by
all
regarded
by
none
rallied
by
the
presence
of
napoleon
and
by
these
daring
words
his
friends
recovered
their
courage
and
of
the
assembly
rose
in
expression
of
their
confidence
and
support
at
this
moment
intelligence
arrived
that
the
five
hundred
were
compelling
lucien
to
put
to
the
vote
napoleon
outlawry
not
an
instant
was
to
be
lost
there
is
a
mysterious
power
in
law
the
passage
of
that
vote
would
probably
have
been
fatal
life
and
death
were
trembling
in
the
balance
i
would
then
have
given
two
hundred
millions
said
napoleon
to
have
had
ney
by
my
side
turning
to
the
ancients
he
exclaimed
if
any
orator
paid
by
foreigners
shall
talk
of
outlawing
me
i
will
appeal
for
protection
to
my
brave
companions
in
arms
whose
plumes
are
nodding
at
the
door
remember
that
i
march
accompanied
by
the
god
of
fortune
and
by
the
god
of
war
he
immediately
left
the
ancients
and
attended
by
his
military
band
hastened
to
the
council
of
five
hundred
on
his
way
he
met
augereau
who
was
pale
and
trembling
deeming
napoleon
lost
you
have
got
yourself
into
a
pretty
fix
said
he
with
deep
agitation
matters
were
worse
at
arcola
napoleon
coolly
replied
keep
quiet
all
will
be
changed
in
half
an
hour
followed
by
his
grenadiers
he
immediately
entered
the
hall
of
the
five
hundred
the
soldiers
remained
near
the
door
napoleon
traversed
alone
half
of
the
room
to
reach
the
bar
it
was
an
hour
in
which
nothing
could
save
him
but
the
resources
of
his
own
mind
furious
shouts
rose
from
all
parts
of
the
house
what
means
this
down
with
the
tyrant
begone
the
winds
says
napoleon
suddenly
escaping
from
the
caverns
of
aeolus
can
give
but
a
faint
idea
of
that
tempest
in
the
midst
of
the
horrible
confusion
he
in
vain
endeavored
to
speak
the
members
in
the
wildest
fray
crowded
around
him
the
grenadiers
witnessing
the
peril
of
their
chief
rushed
to
his
rescue
a
dagger
was
struck
at
his
bosom
a
soldier
with
his
arm
parried
the
blow
with
their
bayonets
they
drove
back
the
members
and
encircling
napoleon
bore
him
from
the
hall
napoleon
had
hardly
descended
the
outer
steps
ere
some
one
informed
him
that
his
brother
lucien
was
surrounded
by
the
infuriated
deputies
and
that
his
life
was
in
imminent
jeopardy
colonel
dumoulin
said
he
take
a
battalion
of
grenadiers
and
hasten
to
my
brother
deliverance
the
soldiers
rushed
into
the
room
drove
back
the
crowd
who
with
violent
menaces
were
surrounding
lucien
and
saying
it
is
by
your
brother
commands
escorted
him
in
safety
out
of
the
ball
into
the
napoleon
now
mounting
his
horse
with
lucien
by
his
side
rode
along
in
front
of
his
troops
the
council
of
five
hundred
exclaimed
lucien
is
dissolved
it
is
i
that
tell
you
so
assassins
have
taken
possession
of
the
hall
of
meeting
i
summon
you
to
march
and
clear
it
of
them
soldiers
said
napoleon
can
i
rely
upon
you
long
live
bonaparte
was
the
simultaneous
response
murat
took
a
battalion
of
grenadiers
and
marched
to
the
entrance
of
the
hall
when
murat
headed
a
column
it
was
well
known
that
there
would
be
no
child
play
charge
bayonets
forward
he
exclaimed
with
imperturbable
coolness
the
drums
beat
the
charge
steadily
the
bristling
line
of
steel
advanced
the
terrified
representatives
leaped
over
the
benches
rushed
through
the
passage
ways
and
sprang
out
of
the
windows
throwing
upon
the
floor
in
their
precipitate
flight
gowns
scarfs
and
hats
in
two
minutes
the
hall
was
cleared
as
the
representatives
were
flying
in
dismay
across
the
garden
on
officer
proposed
that
the
soldiers
should
be
ordered
to
fire
upon
them
napoleon
decisively
refused
saying
it
is
my
wish
that
not
a
single
drop
of
blood
be
split
as
napoleon
wished
to
avail
himself
as
far
as
possible
of
the
forms
of
law
he
assembled
the
two
legislative
bodies
in
the
evening
those
only
attended
who
were
friendly
to
his
cause
unanimously
they
decreed
that
napoleon
had
deserved
well
of
his
country
they
abolished
the
directory
the
executive
power
they
vested
in
napoleon
sieyes
and
ducos
with
the
title
of
consuls
two
committees
of
members
each
taken
from
the
two
councils
were
appointed
to
with
the
consuls
in
forming
a
new
constitution
during
the
evening
the
rumor
reached
paris
that
napoleon
had
failed
in
his
enterprise
the
consternation
was
great
the
mass
of
the
people
of
all
ranks
dreading
the
renewal
of
revolutionary
horrors
and
worn
out
with
past
convulsions
passionately
longed
for
repose
their
only
hope
was
in
napoleon
at
nine
at
night
intelligence
of
the
change
of
government
was
officially
announced
by
a
proclamation
which
the
victor
had
dictated
with
the
rapidity
and
the
glowing
eloquence
which
characterized
all
of
his
mental
acts
it
was
read
by
torchlight
to
assembled
and
deeply
agitated
groups
all
over
the
city
the
welcome
tidings
were
greeted
with
the
liveliest
demonstrations
of
applause
at
three
in
the
morning
napoleon
threw
himself
into
his
carriage
to
return
to
paris
bourrienne
accompanied
him
napoleon
appeared
so
absorbed
in
thought
that
he
uttered
not
one
single
word
during
the
ride
at
four
in
the
morning
he
alighted
from
his
carriage
at
the
door
of
his
dwelling
in
the
rue
chanteraine
josephine
in
the
greatest
anxiety
was
watching
at
the
window
for
his
approach
napoleon
had
not
been
able
to
send
her
one
single
line
during
the
turmoil
and
the
peril
of
that
eventful
day
she
sprang
to
meet
him
napoleon
foundly
encircled
her
in
his
arms
briefly
recapitulated
the
scenes
of
the
day
and
assured
her
that
since
he
had
taken
the
oath
of
office
he
had
not
allowed
himself
to
speak
to
a
single
individual
for
he
wished
that
the
beloved
voice
of
his
josephine
might
be
the
first
to
congratulate
him
upon
his
virtual
accession
to
the
empire
of
france
the
heart
of
josephine
could
appreciate
a
delicacy
of
love
so
refined
and
so
touching
well
might
she
say
napoleon
is
the
most
fascinating
of
men
it
was
then
after
four
in
the
morning
the
dawn
of
the
day
to
conduct
napoleon
to
a
new
scene
of
herculean
toil
in
organizing
the
republic
throwing
himself
upon
a
couch
for
a
few
moments
of
repose
he
exclaimed
gayly
my
josephine
we
sleep
in
the
palace
of
the
luxembourg
napoleon
was
then
but
years
of
age
and
yet
under
circumstances
of
inconceivable
difficulty
with
unhesitating
reliance
upon
his
own
mental
resources
he
assumed
the
enormous
care
of
creating
and
administering
a
lew
government
for
thirty
millions
of
people
never
did
he
achieve
a
victory
which
displayed
more
consummate
genius
on
no
occasion
of
his
life
did
his
majestic
intellectual
power
beam
forth
with
more
brilliance
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
for
ages
to
come
the
world
will
be
united
in
opinion
respecting
this
transaction
some
represent
it
as
an
outrage
against
law
and
liberty
others
consider
it
a
necessary
act
which
put
an
end
to
corruption
and
anarchy
that
the
course
which
napoleon
pursued
was
in
accordance
with
the
wished
of
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
french
people
on
one
can
doubt
it
is
questionable
whether
even
now
france
is
prepared
for
there
can
be
no
question
that
then
the
republic
had
totally
failed
said
napoleon
in
reference
to
this
revolution
for
my
part
all
my
share
of
the
plot
was
confined
to
assembling
the
crowd
of
my
visitors
at
the
same
hour
in
the
morning
and
marching
at
their
head
to
seize
upon
power
it
was
from
the
threshold
of
my
door
and
without
my
friends
having
any
previous
knowledge
of
my
intentions
that
i
led
them
to
this
conquest
p
it
was
amidst
the
brilliant
escort
which
they
formed
their
lively
joy
and
unanimous
ardor
that
i
presented
myself
a
the
bar
of
the
ancients
to
thank
them
for
the
dictatorship
with
which
they
invested
me
metaphysicians
have
disputed
and
will
long
dispute
whether
we
did
not
violate
the
laws
and
whether
we
were
not
criminal
but
these
are
mere
abstractions
which
should
disappear
before
imperious
necessity
one
might
as
well
blame
a
sailor
for
waste
and
destruction
when
he
cuts
away
a
mast
to
save
his
ship
the
fact
is
had
it
not
been
for
us
the
country
must
have
been
lost
we
saved
it
the
authors
of
that
memorable
state
transaction
ought
to
answer
their
accusers
proudly
like
the
roman
protest
that
we
have
saved
our
country
come
with
us
and
render
thanks
to
the
gods
with
the
exception
of
the
jacobins
all
parties
were
strongly
in
favor
of
this
revolution
for
ten
years
the
people
had
been
so
accustomed
to
the
violation
of
the
laws
that
they
had
ceased
to
condemn
such
acts
and
judged
of
them
only
by
their
consequences
all
over
france
the
feeling
was
nearly
universal
in
favor
of
the
new
government
says
alison
who
surely
will
not
be
accused
of
regarding
napoleon
with
a
partial
eye
napoleon
rivaled
caesar
in
the
elemency
with
which
he
used
his
victory
no
proscriptions
or
massacres
few
arrests
or
imprisonments
followed
the
triumph
of
order
over
revolution
on
the
contrary
numerous
acts
of
merey
as
wise
as
they
were
magnanimous
illustrated
the
rise
of
the
consular
throne
the
elevation
of
napoleon
was
not
only
unstained
by
blood
but
not
even
a
single
captive
long
lamented
the
car
of
the
victor
a
signal
triumph
of
the
principles
of
humility
over
those
of
cruelty
glorious
alike
to
the
actors
and
the
age
in
which
it
occurred
and
a
memorable
proof
how
much
more
durable
are
the
victories
obtained
by
moderation
and
wisdom
than
those
achieved
by
violence
and
stained
by
blood
