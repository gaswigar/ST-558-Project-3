the
house
in
the
mist
i
an
open
door
it
was
a
night
to
drive
any
man
indoors
not
only
was
the
darkness
impenetrable
but
the
raw
mist
enveloping
hill
and
valley
made
the
open
road
anything
but
desirable
to
a
belated
wayfarer
like
myself
being
young
untrammeled
and
naturally
indifferent
to
danger
i
was
not
averse
to
adventure
and
having
my
fortune
to
make
was
always
on
the
lookout
for
el
dorado
which
to
ardent
souls
lies
ever
beyond
the
next
turning
consequently
when
i
saw
a
light
shimmering
through
the
mist
at
my
right
i
resolved
to
make
for
it
and
the
shelter
it
so
opportunely
offered
but
i
did
not
realize
then
as
i
do
now
that
shelter
does
not
necessarily
imply
refuge
or
i
might
not
have
undertaken
this
adventure
with
so
light
a
heart
yet
who
knows
the
impulses
of
an
unfettered
spirit
lean
toward
daring
and
youth
as
i
have
said
seeks
the
strange
the
unknown
and
sometimes
the
terrible
my
path
toward
this
light
was
by
no
means
an
easy
one
after
confused
wanderings
through
tangled
hedges
and
a
struggle
with
obstacles
of
whose
nature
i
received
the
most
curious
impression
in
the
surrounding
murk
i
arrived
in
front
of
a
long
low
building
which
to
my
astonishment
i
found
standing
with
doors
and
windows
open
to
the
pervading
mist
save
for
one
square
casement
through
which
the
light
shone
from
a
row
of
candles
placed
on
a
long
mahogany
table
the
quiet
and
seeming
emptiness
of
this
odd
and
picturesque
building
made
me
pause
i
am
not
much
affected
by
visible
danger
but
this
silent
room
with
its
air
of
sinister
expectancy
struck
me
most
unpleasantly
and
i
was
about
to
reconsider
my
first
impulse
and
withdraw
again
to
the
road
when
a
second
look
thrown
back
upon
the
comfortable
interior
i
was
leaving
convinced
me
of
my
folly
and
sent
me
straight
toward
the
door
which
stood
so
invitingly
open
but
up
the
path
my
progress
was
again
stayed
by
the
sight
of
a
man
issuing
from
the
house
i
had
so
rashly
looked
upon
as
devoid
of
all
human
presence
he
seemed
in
haste
and
at
the
moment
my
eye
first
fell
on
him
was
engaged
in
replacing
his
watch
in
his
pocket
but
he
did
not
shut
the
door
behind
him
which
i
thought
odd
especially
as
his
final
glance
had
been
a
backward
one
and
seemed
to
take
in
all
the
appointments
of
the
place
he
was
so
hurriedly
leaving
as
we
met
he
raised
his
hat
this
likewise
struck
me
as
peculiar
for
the
deference
he
displayed
was
more
marked
than
that
usually
bestowed
on
strangers
while
his
lack
of
surprise
at
an
encounter
more
or
less
startling
in
such
a
mist
was
calculated
to
puzzle
an
ordinary
man
like
myself
indeed
he
was
so
little
impressed
by
my
presence
there
that
he
was
for
passing
me
without
a
word
or
any
other
hint
of
good
fellowship
save
the
bow
of
which
i
have
spoken
but
this
did
not
suit
me
i
was
hungry
cold
and
eager
for
creature
comforts
and
the
house
before
me
gave
forth
not
only
heat
but
a
savory
odor
which
in
itself
was
an
invitation
hard
to
ignore
i
therefore
accosted
the
man
will
bed
and
supper
be
provided
me
here
i
asked
i
am
tired
out
with
a
long
tramp
over
the
hills
and
hungry
enough
to
pay
anything
in
reason
i
stopped
for
the
man
had
disappeared
he
had
not
paused
at
my
appeal
and
the
mist
had
swallowed
him
but
at
the
break
in
my
sentence
his
voice
came
back
in
tones
and
i
heard
supper
will
be
ready
at
nine
and
there
are
beds
for
all
enter
sir
you
are
the
first
to
arrive
but
the
others
can
not
be
far
behind
a
queer
greeting
certainly
but
when
i
strove
to
question
him
as
to
its
meaning
his
voice
returned
to
me
from
such
a
distance
that
i
doubted
if
my
words
had
reached
him
with
any
more
distinctness
than
his
answer
reached
me
well
thought
i
it
is
as
if
a
lodging
had
been
denied
me
he
invited
me
to
enter
and
enter
i
will
the
house
to
which
i
now
naturally
directed
a
glance
of
much
more
careful
scrutiny
than
before
was
no
ordinary
but
a
rambling
old
mansion
made
conspicuously
larger
here
and
there
by
jutting
porches
and
more
than
one
convenient
though
furnished
warmed
and
lighted
with
candles
as
i
have
previously
described
it
had
about
it
an
air
of
disuse
which
made
me
feel
myself
an
intruder
in
spite
of
the
welcome
i
had
received
but
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
stand
upon
ceremony
and
ere
long
i
found
myself
inside
the
great
room
and
before
the
blazing
logs
whose
glow
had
lighted
up
the
doorway
and
added
its
own
attraction
to
the
other
allurements
of
the
inviting
place
though
the
open
door
made
a
draft
which
was
anything
but
pleasant
i
did
not
feel
like
closing
it
and
was
astonished
to
observe
the
effect
of
the
mist
through
the
square
thus
left
open
to
the
night
it
was
not
an
agreeable
one
and
instinctively
turning
my
back
upon
that
quarter
of
the
room
i
let
my
eyes
roam
over
the
wainscoted
walls
and
the
odd
pieces
of
furniture
which
gave
such
an
air
of
richness
to
the
place
as
nothing
of
the
kind
had
ever
fallen
under
my
eyes
before
i
should
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
opportunity
of
gratifying
my
taste
for
the
curious
and
the
beautiful
if
the
quaint
old
chairs
i
saw
standing
about
me
on
every
side
had
not
all
been
empty
but
the
solitude
of
the
place
so
much
more
oppressive
than
the
solitude
of
the
road
i
had
left
struck
cold
to
my
heart
and
i
missed
the
cheer
rightfully
belonging
to
such
attractive
surroundings
suddenly
i
bethought
me
of
the
many
other
apartments
likely
to
be
found
in
so
spacious
a
dwelling
and
going
to
the
nearest
door
i
opened
it
and
called
out
for
the
master
of
the
house
but
only
an
echo
came
back
and
returning
to
the
fire
i
sat
down
before
the
cheering
blaze
in
quiet
acceptance
of
a
situation
too
lonely
for
comfort
yet
not
without
a
certain
piquant
interest
for
a
man
of
free
mind
and
adventurous
disposition
like
myself
after
all
if
supper
was
to
be
served
at
nine
someone
must
be
expected
to
eat
it
i
should
surely
not
be
left
much
longer
without
companions
meanwhile
ample
amusement
awaited
me
in
the
contemplation
of
a
picture
which
next
to
the
large
fireplace
was
the
most
prominent
object
in
the
room
this
picture
was
a
portrait
and
a
remarkable
one
the
countenance
it
portrayed
was
both
characteristic
and
forcible
and
so
interested
me
that
in
studying
it
i
quite
forgot
both
hunger
and
weariness
indeed
its
effect
upon
me
was
such
that
after
gazing
at
it
uninterruptedly
for
a
few
minutes
i
discovered
that
its
various
features
the
narrow
eyes
in
which
a
hint
of
craft
gave
a
strange
gleam
to
their
native
intelligence
the
steadfast
chin
strong
as
the
rock
of
the
hills
i
had
wearily
tramped
all
day
the
cunning
wrinkles
which
yet
did
not
interfere
with
a
latent
that
made
the
face
as
attractive
as
it
was
puzzling
had
so
established
themselves
in
my
mind
that
i
continued
to
see
them
before
me
whichever
way
i
turned
and
found
it
impossible
to
shake
off
their
influence
even
after
i
had
resolutely
set
my
mind
in
another
direction
by
endeavoring
to
recall
what
i
knew
of
the
town
into
which
i
had
strayed
i
had
come
from
scranton
and
was
now
according
to
my
best
judgment
in
one
of
those
rural
districts
of
western
pennsylvania
which
breed
such
strange
and
sturdy
characters
but
of
this
special
neighborhood
its
inhabitants
and
its
industries
i
knew
nothing
nor
was
likely
to
so
long
as
i
remained
in
the
solitude
i
have
endeavored
to
describe
but
these
impressions
and
these
thoughts
if
thoughts
they
were
presently
received
a
check
a
loud
halloo
rose
from
somewhere
in
the
mist
followed
by
a
string
of
muttered
imprecations
which
convinced
me
that
the
person
now
attempting
to
approach
the
house
was
encountering
some
of
the
many
difficulties
which
had
beset
me
in
the
same
undertaking
a
few
minutes
before
i
therefore
raised
my
voice
and
shouted
out
here
this
way
after
which
i
sat
still
and
awaited
developments
there
was
a
huge
clock
in
one
of
the
corners
whose
loud
tick
filled
up
every
interval
of
silence
by
this
clock
it
was
just
ten
minutes
to
eight
when
two
gentlemen
i
should
say
men
and
coarse
men
at
that
crossed
the
open
threshold
and
entered
the
house
their
appearance
was
more
or
less
noteworthy
unpleasantly
so
i
am
obliged
to
add
one
was
and
obese
the
other
was
tall
thin
and
wiry
and
showed
as
many
seams
in
his
face
as
a
blighted
apple
neither
of
the
two
had
anything
to
recommend
him
either
in
appearance
or
address
save
a
certain
veneer
of
polite
assumption
as
transparent
as
it
was
offensive
as
i
listened
to
the
forced
sallies
of
the
one
and
the
hollow
laugh
of
the
other
i
was
glad
that
i
was
large
of
frame
and
strong
of
arm
and
used
to
all
kinds
of
men
and
brutes
as
these
two
seemed
no
more
astonished
at
my
presence
than
the
man
i
had
met
at
the
gate
i
checked
the
question
which
instinctively
rose
to
my
lips
and
with
a
simple
bow
responded
to
by
a
more
or
less
familiar
nod
from
either
accepted
the
situation
with
all
the
the
occasion
seemed
to
demand
perhaps
this
was
wise
perhaps
it
was
not
there
was
little
opportunity
to
judge
for
the
start
they
both
gave
as
they
encountered
the
eyes
of
the
picture
before
mentioned
drew
my
attention
to
a
consideration
of
the
different
ways
in
which
men
however
similar
in
other
respects
express
sudden
and
emotion
the
big
man
simply
allowed
his
astonishment
dread
or
whatever
the
feeling
was
which
moved
him
to
ooze
forth
in
a
cold
and
deathly
perspiration
which
robbed
his
cheeks
of
color
and
cast
a
bluish
shadow
over
his
narrow
and
retreating
temples
while
the
thin
and
waspish
man
caught
in
the
same
trap
for
trap
i
saw
it
was
shouted
aloud
in
his
mirth
the
false
and
cruel
character
of
which
would
have
made
me
shudder
if
all
expression
of
feeling
on
my
part
had
not
been
held
in
check
by
the
interest
i
immediately
experienced
in
the
display
of
open
bravado
with
which
in
another
moment
these
two
tried
to
carry
off
their
mutual
embarrassment
good
likeness
eh
laughed
the
man
quite
an
idea
that
makes
him
one
of
us
again
well
he
welcome
in
oils
ca
say
much
to
us
from
canvas
eh
and
the
rafters
above
him
vibrated
as
his
violent
efforts
at
joviality
went
up
in
loud
and
louder
assertion
from
his
thin
throat
a
nudge
from
the
other
elbow
stopped
him
and
i
saw
them
both
cast
glances
in
my
direction
one
of
the
witherspoon
boys
queried
one
perhaps
snarled
the
other
i
never
saw
but
one
of
them
there
are
five
are
there
eustace
believed
in
marrying
off
his
gals
young
damn
him
yes
and
he
have
married
them
off
younger
if
he
had
known
how
numbers
were
going
to
count
some
day
among
the
westonhaughs
and
he
laughed
again
in
a
way
i
should
certainly
have
felt
it
my
business
to
resent
if
my
indignation
as
well
as
the
allusions
which
had
called
it
forth
had
not
been
put
to
an
end
by
a
fresh
arrival
through
the
veiling
mist
which
hung
like
a
shroud
at
the
doorway
this
time
it
was
for
me
to
experience
a
shock
of
something
like
fear
yet
the
personage
who
called
up
this
sensation
in
my
naturally
hardy
nature
was
old
and
to
all
appearance
harmless
from
disability
if
not
from
good
will
his
form
was
bent
over
upon
itself
like
a
bow
and
only
from
the
glances
he
shot
from
his
upturned
eyes
was
the
fact
made
evident
that
a
redoubtable
nature
full
of
force
and
malignity
had
just
brought
its
quota
of
evil
into
a
room
already
overflowing
with
dangerous
and
menacing
passions
as
this
old
wretch
either
from
the
feebleness
of
age
or
from
the
infirmity
i
have
mentioned
had
great
difficulty
in
walking
he
had
brought
with
him
a
small
boy
whose
business
it
was
to
direct
his
tottering
steps
as
best
he
could
but
once
settled
in
his
chair
he
drove
away
this
boy
with
his
pointed
oak
stick
and
with
some
harsh
words
about
caring
for
the
horse
and
being
on
time
in
the
morning
he
sent
him
out
into
the
mist
as
this
little
shivering
and
pathetic
figure
vanished
the
old
man
drew
with
gasp
and
haw
a
number
of
deep
breaths
which
shook
his
bent
back
and
did
their
share
no
doubt
in
restoring
his
own
disturbed
circulation
then
with
a
sinister
twist
which
brought
his
pointed
chin
and
twinkling
eyes
again
into
view
he
remarked
have
ye
a
word
for
kinsman
luke
you
two
it
is
often
i
get
out
among
ye
shakee
nephew
shakee
hector
and
now
who
the
boy
in
the
window
my
eyes
are
what
they
used
to
be
but
he
do
seem
to
favor
the
westonhaughs
one
of
salmon
four
grandchildren
think
or
a
shoot
from
eustace
gnarled
old
trunk
his
gals
all
married
americans
and
one
of
them
i
been
told
was
a
giant
like
this
fellow
as
this
description
pointed
directly
toward
me
i
was
about
to
venture
a
response
on
my
own
account
when
my
attention
as
well
as
theirs
was
freshly
attracted
by
a
loud
whoa
at
the
gate
followed
by
the
hasty
but
assured
entrance
of
a
dapper
wizen
but
perfectly
preserved
little
old
gentleman
with
a
bag
in
his
hand
looking
askance
with
eyes
that
were
like
two
beads
first
at
the
two
men
who
were
now
elbowing
each
other
for
the
best
place
before
the
fire
and
then
at
the
revolting
figure
in
the
chair
he
bestowed
his
greeting
which
consisted
of
an
elaborate
bow
not
on
them
but
upon
the
picture
hanging
so
conspicuously
on
the
open
wall
before
him
and
then
taking
me
within
the
scope
of
his
quick
circling
glance
cried
out
with
an
assumption
of
great
cordiality
good
evening
gentlemen
good
evening
one
good
evening
all
nothing
like
being
on
the
tick
i
sorry
the
night
has
turned
out
so
badly
some
may
find
it
too
thick
for
travel
that
would
be
bad
eh
very
bad
for
as
none
of
the
men
he
openly
addressed
saw
fit
to
answer
save
by
the
hitch
of
a
shoulder
or
a
leer
quickly
suppressed
i
kept
silent
also
but
this
reticence
marked
as
it
was
did
not
seem
to
offend
the
shaking
the
wet
from
the
umbrella
he
held
he
stood
the
dripping
article
up
in
a
corner
and
then
came
and
placed
his
feet
on
the
fender
to
do
this
he
had
to
crowd
between
the
two
men
already
occupying
the
best
part
of
the
hearth
but
he
showed
no
concern
at
incommoding
them
and
bore
their
cross
looks
and
threatening
gestures
with
professional
equanimity
you
know
me
he
now
unexpectedly
snapped
bestowing
another
look
over
his
shoulder
at
that
oppressive
figure
in
the
chair
did
i
say
that
i
had
risen
when
the
latter
sat
i
no
westonhaugh
i
nor
yet
a
witherspoon
nor
a
clapsaddle
i
only
smead
the
lawyer
anthony
westonhaugh
lawyer
he
repeated
with
another
glance
of
recognition
in
the
direction
of
the
picture
i
drew
up
his
last
will
and
testament
and
until
all
of
his
wishes
have
been
duly
carried
out
am
entitled
by
the
terms
of
that
will
to
be
regarded
both
legally
and
socially
as
his
representative
this
you
all
know
but
it
is
my
way
to
make
everything
clear
as
i
proceed
a
lawyer
trick
no
doubt
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
entirely
exempt
from
such
a
grumble
from
the
large
man
who
seemed
to
have
been
disturbed
in
some
absorbing
calculation
he
was
carrying
on
mingled
with
a
few
muttered
words
of
forced
acknowledgment
from
the
restless
old
sinner
in
the
chair
made
it
unnecessary
for
me
to
reply
even
if
the
last
comer
had
given
me
the
opportunity
it
getting
late
he
cried
with
an
easy
garrulity
rather
amusing
under
the
circumstances
two
more
trains
came
in
as
i
left
the
depot
if
old
phil
was
on
hand
with
his
wagon
several
more
members
of
this
interesting
family
may
be
here
before
the
clock
strikes
if
not
the
assemblage
is
like
to
be
small
too
small
i
heard
him
grumble
a
minute
after
under
his
breath
i
wish
it
were
a
matter
of
one
spoke
up
the
big
man
striking
his
breast
in
a
way
to
make
it
perfectly
apparent
whom
he
meant
by
that
word
and
having
if
i
may
judge
by
the
mingled
laugh
and
growl
of
his
companions
thus
shown
his
hand
both
figuratively
and
literally
he
relapsed
into
the
calculation
which
seemed
to
absorb
all
of
his
unoccupied
moments
generous
very
commented
the
lawyer
in
a
murmur
which
was
more
than
audible
pity
that
sentiments
of
such
broad
benevolence
should
go
unrewarded
this
because
at
that
very
instant
wheels
were
heard
in
front
also
a
jangle
of
voices
in
some
controversy
about
fares
which
promised
anything
but
a
pleasing
addition
to
the
already
none
too
desirable
company
i
suppose
that
sister
janet
snarled
out
the
one
addressed
as
hector
there
was
no
love
in
his
voice
despite
the
relationship
hinted
at
and
i
awaited
the
entrance
of
this
woman
with
some
curiosity
but
her
appearance
heralded
by
many
a
puff
and
pant
which
the
damp
air
exaggerated
in
a
prodigious
way
did
not
seem
to
warrant
the
interest
i
had
shown
in
it
as
she
stepped
into
the
room
i
saw
only
a
big
frowsy
woman
who
had
attempted
to
make
a
show
with
a
new
silk
dress
and
a
hat
in
the
latest
fashion
but
who
had
lamentably
failed
owing
to
the
slouchiness
of
her
figure
and
some
misadventure
by
which
her
hat
had
been
set
awry
on
her
head
and
her
usual
complacency
destroyed
later
i
noted
that
her
eyes
had
a
false
twinkle
in
them
and
that
commonplace
as
she
looked
she
was
one
to
steer
clear
of
in
times
of
necessity
and
distress
she
too
evidently
expected
to
find
the
door
open
and
people
assembled
but
she
had
not
anticipated
being
confronted
by
the
portrait
on
the
wall
and
cringed
in
an
unpleasant
way
as
she
stumbled
by
it
into
one
of
the
corners
the
old
man
who
had
doubtless
caught
the
rustle
of
her
dress
as
she
passed
him
emitted
one
short
sentence
almost
late
said
he
her
answer
was
a
sputter
of
words
it
the
fault
of
that
driver
she
complained
if
he
had
taken
one
drop
more
at
the
house
i
might
really
not
have
got
here
at
all
that
would
not
have
inconvenienced
but
oh
what
a
grudge
i
would
have
owed
that
skinflint
brother
of
ours
here
she
shook
her
fist
at
the
picture
for
making
our
good
luck
depend
upon
our
arrival
within
two
short
strokes
of
the
clock
there
are
several
to
come
yet
blandly
observed
the
lawyer
but
before
the
words
were
well
out
of
his
mouth
we
all
became
aware
of
a
new
presence
a
woman
whose
somber
grace
and
quiet
bearing
gave
distinction
to
her
unobtrusive
entrance
and
caused
a
feeling
of
something
like
awe
to
follow
the
first
sight
of
her
cold
features
and
deep
eyes
but
this
soon
passed
in
the
more
human
sentiment
awakened
by
the
soft
pleading
which
infused
her
gaze
with
a
touching
femininity
she
wore
a
long
loose
garment
which
fell
without
a
fold
from
chin
to
foot
and
in
her
arms
she
seemed
to
carry
something
never
before
had
i
seen
so
beautiful
a
woman
as
i
was
contemplating
her
with
respect
but
yet
with
a
masculine
intentness
i
could
not
quite
suppress
two
or
three
other
persons
came
in
and
now
i
began
to
notice
that
the
eyes
of
all
these
people
turned
mainly
one
way
and
that
was
toward
the
clock
another
small
circumstance
likewise
drew
my
attention
whenever
any
one
entered
and
there
were
one
or
two
additional
arrivals
during
the
five
minutes
preceding
the
striking
of
the
hour
a
frown
settled
for
an
instant
on
every
brow
giving
to
each
and
all
a
similar
look
for
the
interpretation
of
which
i
lacked
the
key
yet
not
on
every
brow
either
there
was
one
which
remained
undisturbed
and
showed
only
a
grand
patience
as
the
hands
of
the
big
clock
neared
the
point
of
eight
a
furtive
smile
appeared
on
more
than
one
face
and
when
the
hour
rang
out
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
swept
through
the
room
to
which
the
little
old
lawyer
responded
with
a
grunt
as
he
moved
from
his
place
and
proceeded
to
the
door
this
he
had
scarcely
shut
when
a
chorus
of
voices
rose
from
without
three
or
four
lingerers
had
pushed
their
way
as
far
as
the
gate
only
to
see
the
door
of
the
house
shut
in
their
faces
too
late
growled
old
man
luke
from
between
the
locks
of
his
long
beard
too
late
shrieked
the
woman
who
had
come
so
near
being
late
herself
too
late
smoothly
acquiesced
the
lawyer
locking
and
bolting
the
door
with
a
deft
and
assured
hand
but
the
four
or
five
persons
who
thus
found
themselves
barred
out
did
not
accept
without
a
struggle
the
decision
of
the
more
fortunate
ones
assembled
within
more
than
one
hand
began
pounding
on
the
door
and
we
could
hear
cries
of
the
train
was
behind
time
your
clock
is
fast
you
are
cheating
us
you
want
it
all
for
yourselves
we
will
have
the
law
on
you
and
other
bitter
adjurations
unintelligible
to
me
from
my
ignorance
of
the
circumstances
which
called
them
forth
but
the
wary
old
lawyer
simply
shook
his
head
and
answered
nothing
whereat
a
murmur
of
gratification
rose
from
within
and
a
howl
of
almost
frenzied
dismay
from
without
which
latter
presently
received
point
from
a
startling
vision
which
now
appeared
at
the
casement
where
the
lights
burned
a
man
face
looked
in
and
behind
it
that
of
a
woman
so
wild
and
maddened
by
some
sort
of
that
i
found
my
sympathies
aroused
in
spite
of
the
glare
of
evil
passions
which
made
both
of
these
countenances
something
less
than
human
but
the
lawyer
met
the
stare
of
these
four
eyes
with
a
quiet
chuckle
which
found
its
echo
in
the
mirth
of
those
about
him
and
moving
over
to
the
window
where
they
still
peered
in
he
drew
together
the
two
heavy
shutters
which
hitherto
had
stood
back
against
the
wall
and
fastening
them
with
a
bar
shut
out
the
sight
of
this
despair
if
he
could
not
shut
out
the
protests
which
ever
and
anon
were
shouted
through
the
meanwhile
one
form
had
sat
through
this
whole
incident
without
a
gesture
and
on
the
quiet
brow
from
which
i
could
not
keep
my
eyes
no
shadows
appeared
save
the
perpetual
one
of
native
melancholy
which
was
at
once
the
source
of
its
attraction
and
the
secret
of
its
power
into
what
sort
of
gathering
had
i
stumbled
and
why
did
i
prefer
to
await
developments
rather
than
ask
the
simplest
question
of
any
one
about
me
meantime
the
lawyer
had
proceeded
to
make
certain
preparations
with
the
help
of
one
or
two
willing
hands
he
had
drawn
the
great
table
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
having
seen
the
candles
restored
to
their
places
began
to
open
his
small
bag
and
take
from
it
a
roll
of
paper
and
several
flat
documents
laying
the
latter
in
the
center
of
the
table
and
slowly
unrolling
the
former
he
consulted
with
his
foxy
eyes
the
faces
surrounding
him
and
smiled
with
secret
malevolence
as
he
noted
that
every
chair
and
every
form
were
turned
away
from
the
picture
before
which
he
had
bent
with
such
obvious
courtesy
on
entering
i
alone
stood
erect
and
this
possibly
was
why
a
gleam
of
curiosity
was
noticeable
in
his
glance
as
he
ended
his
scrutiny
of
my
countenance
and
bent
his
gaze
again
upon
the
paper
he
held
heavens
thought
i
what
shall
i
answer
this
man
if
he
asks
me
why
i
continued
to
remain
in
a
spot
where
i
have
so
little
business
the
impulse
came
to
go
but
such
was
the
effect
of
this
strange
convocation
of
persons
at
night
and
in
a
mist
which
was
itself
a
nightmare
that
i
failed
to
take
action
and
remained
riveted
to
my
place
while
smead
consulted
his
roll
and
finally
asked
in
a
tone
quite
unlike
his
previous
sarcastic
speech
the
names
of
those
whom
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
before
him
the
old
man
in
the
chair
spoke
up
first
luke
westonhaugh
he
announced
very
good
responded
the
lawyer
hector
westonhaugh
came
from
the
thin
man
a
nod
and
a
look
toward
the
next
john
westonhaugh
nephew
asked
the
lawyer
yes
go
on
and
be
quick
supper
will
be
ready
at
nine
eunice
westonhaugh
spoke
up
a
soft
voice
i
felt
my
heart
bound
as
if
some
inner
echo
responded
to
that
name
daughter
of
whom
hudson
westonhaugh
she
gently
faltered
my
father
is
dead
died
last
night
i
am
his
only
heir
a
grumble
of
dissatisfaction
and
a
glint
of
unrelieved
hate
came
from
the
figure
whose
malevolence
had
so
revolted
me
but
the
lawyer
was
not
to
be
shaken
very
good
it
is
fortunate
you
trusted
your
feet
rather
than
the
train
and
now
you
what
is
your
name
he
was
looking
not
at
me
as
i
had
at
first
feared
but
at
the
man
next
to
me
a
slim
but
slippery
youth
whose
small
red
eyes
made
me
shudder
william
witherspoon
barbara
son
yes
where
are
your
brothers
one
of
them
i
think
is
outside
here
he
laughed
the
other
is
the
way
he
uttered
this
word
made
me
set
him
down
as
one
to
be
especially
wary
of
when
he
smiled
but
then
i
had
already
passed
judgment
on
him
at
my
first
view
and
you
madam
this
to
the
large
dowdy
woman
with
the
uncertain
eye
a
contrast
to
the
young
and
melancholy
eunice
janet
clapsaddle
she
replied
waddling
hungrily
forward
and
getting
unpleasantly
near
the
speaker
for
he
moved
off
as
she
approached
and
took
his
stand
in
the
clear
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
very
good
mistress
clapsaddle
you
were
a
westonhaugh
i
believe
you
hypocrite
that
you
are
she
blurted
out
i
do
understand
your
lawyer
ways
i
like
plain
speaking
myself
you
know
me
and
luke
and
hector
and
and
most
of
us
indeed
except
that
puny
girl
yonder
whom
having
been
brought
up
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
we
have
none
of
us
seen
since
she
was
a
screaming
baby
in
hildegarde
arms
and
the
young
gentleman
over
there
here
she
indicated
me
who
shows
so
little
likeness
to
the
rest
of
the
family
he
will
have
to
make
it
pretty
plain
who
his
father
was
before
we
shall
feel
like
acknowledging
him
either
as
the
son
of
one
of
eustace
girls
or
a
chip
from
brother
salmon
hard
old
block
as
this
caused
all
eyes
to
turn
upon
me
even
i
smiled
as
i
stepped
forward
the
lawyer
did
not
return
that
smile
what
is
your
name
he
asked
shortly
and
sharply
as
if
he
distrusted
me
hugh
austin
was
my
quiet
reply
there
is
no
such
name
on
the
list
snapped
old
smead
with
an
authoritative
gesture
toward
those
who
seemed
anxious
to
enter
a
protest
probably
not
i
returned
for
i
am
neither
a
witherspoon
a
westonhaugh
nor
a
clapsaddle
i
am
merely
a
chance
wayfarer
passing
through
the
town
on
my
way
west
i
thought
this
house
was
a
tavern
or
at
least
a
place
i
could
lodge
in
the
man
i
met
in
the
doorway
told
me
as
much
and
so
i
am
here
if
my
company
is
not
agreeable
or
if
you
wish
this
room
to
yourselves
let
me
go
into
the
kitchen
i
promise
not
to
meddle
with
the
supper
hungry
as
i
am
or
perhaps
you
wish
me
to
join
the
crowd
outside
it
seems
to
be
increasing
no
no
came
from
all
parts
of
the
room
do
let
the
door
be
opened
nothing
could
keep
lemuel
and
his
crowd
out
if
they
once
got
foot
over
the
threshold
the
lawyer
rubbed
his
chin
he
seemed
to
be
in
some
sort
of
quandary
first
he
scrutinized
me
from
under
his
shaggy
brows
with
a
sharp
gleam
of
suspicion
then
his
features
softened
and
with
a
side
glance
at
the
young
woman
who
called
herself
eunice
perhaps
because
she
was
worth
looking
at
perhaps
because
she
had
partly
risen
at
my
words
he
slipped
toward
a
door
i
had
before
observed
in
the
wainscoting
on
the
left
of
the
mantelpiece
and
softly
opened
it
upon
what
looked
like
a
narrow
staircase
we
can
not
let
you
go
out
said
he
and
we
can
not
let
you
have
a
finger
in
our
viands
before
the
hour
comes
for
serving
them
so
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
follow
this
staircase
to
the
top
you
will
find
it
ends
in
a
room
comfortable
enough
for
the
wayfarer
you
call
yourself
in
that
room
you
can
rest
till
the
way
is
clear
for
you
to
continue
your
travels
better
we
can
not
do
for
you
this
house
is
not
a
tavern
but
the
somewhat
valuable
property
of
he
turned
with
a
bow
and
smile
as
every
one
there
drew
a
deep
breath
but
no
one
ventured
to
end
that
sentence
i
would
have
given
all
my
future
prospects
which
by
the
way
were
not
very
great
to
remain
in
that
room
the
oddity
of
the
situation
the
mystery
of
the
occurrence
the
suspense
i
saw
in
every
face
the
eagerness
of
the
cries
i
heard
redoubled
from
time
to
time
outside
the
malevolence
but
poorly
disguised
in
the
old
lawyer
countenance
and
above
all
the
presence
of
that
woman
which
was
the
one
to
the
general
tone
of
villainy
with
which
the
room
was
charged
filled
me
with
curiosity
if
i
might
call
it
by
no
other
name
that
made
my
acquiescence
in
the
demand
thus
made
upon
me
positively
heroic
but
there
seemed
no
other
course
for
me
to
follow
and
with
a
last
lingering
glance
at
the
genial
fire
and
a
quick
look
about
me
which
happily
encountered
hers
i
stooped
my
head
to
suit
the
low
and
narrow
doorway
opened
for
my
accommodation
and
instantly
found
myself
in
darkness
the
door
had
been
immediately
closed
by
the
lawyer
impatient
hand
ii
with
my
ear
to
the
wainscoting
no
move
more
unwise
could
have
been
made
by
the
old
lawyer
that
is
if
his
intention
had
been
to
rid
himself
of
an
unwelcome
witness
for
finding
myself
thrust
thus
suddenly
from
the
scene
i
naturally
stood
still
instead
of
mounting
the
stairs
and
by
standing
still
discovered
that
though
shut
from
sight
i
was
not
from
sound
distinctly
through
the
panel
of
the
door
which
was
much
thinner
no
doubt
than
the
old
fox
imagined
i
heard
one
of
the
men
present
shout
out
well
that
makes
the
number
less
by
the
murmur
which
followed
this
remark
came
plainly
to
my
ears
and
greatly
rejoicing
over
what
i
considered
my
good
luck
i
settled
myself
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
stairs
in
the
hope
of
catching
some
word
which
would
reveal
to
me
the
mystery
of
this
scene
it
was
not
long
in
coming
old
smead
had
now
his
audience
before
him
in
good
shape
and
his
next
words
were
of
a
character
to
make
evident
the
purpose
of
this
meeting
heirs
of
anthony
westonhaugh
deceased
he
began
in
a
voice
strangely
unmusical
i
congratulate
you
upon
your
good
fortune
at
being
at
this
especial
moment
on
the
inner
rather
than
outer
side
of
your
amiable
relative
front
door
his
will
which
you
have
assembled
to
hear
read
is
well
known
to
you
by
it
his
whole
property
not
so
large
as
some
of
you
might
wish
but
yet
a
goodly
property
for
farmers
like
yourselves
is
to
be
divided
this
night
share
and
share
alike
among
such
of
his
relatives
as
have
found
it
convenient
to
be
present
here
between
the
strokes
of
seven
and
eight
if
some
of
our
friends
have
failed
us
through
sloth
sickness
or
the
misfortune
of
mistaking
the
road
they
have
our
sympathy
but
they
can
not
have
can
not
have
his
dollars
echoed
a
rasping
voice
which
from
its
smothered
sound
probably
came
from
the
bearded
lips
of
the
old
reprobate
in
the
chair
the
lawyer
waited
for
one
or
two
other
repetitions
of
this
phrase
a
phrase
which
for
some
unimaginable
reason
seemed
to
give
him
an
odd
sort
of
pleasure
then
he
went
on
with
greater
distinctness
and
a
certain
sly
emphasis
chilling
in
effect
but
very
professional
ladies
and
gentlemen
shall
i
read
this
will
no
no
the
division
the
division
tell
us
what
we
are
to
have
rose
in
a
shout
about
him
there
was
a
pause
i
could
imagine
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
lawyer
traveling
from
face
to
face
as
each
thus
gave
voice
to
his
cupidity
and
the
thin
curl
of
his
lips
as
he
remarked
in
a
slow
tantalizing
way
there
was
more
in
the
old
man
clutches
than
you
think
a
gasp
of
greed
shook
the
partition
against
which
my
ear
was
pressed
some
one
must
have
drawn
up
against
the
wainscoting
since
my
departure
from
the
room
i
found
myself
wondering
which
of
them
it
was
meantime
old
smead
was
having
his
say
with
the
smoothness
of
a
man
who
perfectly
understands
what
is
required
of
him
westonhaugh
would
not
have
put
you
to
so
much
trouble
or
had
you
wait
so
long
if
he
had
not
expected
to
reward
you
amply
there
are
shares
in
this
bag
which
are
worth
thousands
instead
of
hundreds
now
now
stop
that
hands
off
hands
off
there
are
calculations
to
make
first
how
many
of
you
are
there
count
up
some
of
you
nine
called
out
a
voice
with
such
rapacious
eagerness
that
the
word
was
almost
unintelligible
nine
how
slowly
the
old
knave
spoke
what
pleasure
he
seemed
to
take
in
the
suspense
he
purposely
made
as
exasperating
as
possible
well
if
each
one
gets
his
share
he
may
count
himself
richer
by
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
than
when
he
came
in
here
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
they
had
expected
no
more
than
thirty
surprise
made
them
speechless
that
is
for
a
moment
then
a
pandemonium
of
hurrahs
shrieks
and
enthusiasm
made
the
room
ring
till
wonder
seized
them
again
and
a
sudden
silence
fell
through
which
i
caught
a
wail
of
grief
from
the
disappointed
ones
without
which
heard
in
the
dark
and
narrow
place
in
which
i
was
confined
had
a
peculiarly
weird
and
desolate
effect
perhaps
it
likewise
was
heard
by
some
of
the
fortunate
ones
within
perhaps
one
head
to
mark
which
in
this
moment
of
universal
elation
i
would
have
given
a
year
from
my
life
turned
toward
the
dark
without
in
recognition
of
the
despair
thus
piteously
voiced
but
if
so
no
token
of
the
same
came
to
me
and
i
could
but
hope
that
she
had
shown
by
some
such
movement
the
natural
sympathy
of
her
sex
meanwhile
the
lawyer
was
addressing
the
company
in
his
smoothest
and
most
sarcastic
tones
westonhaugh
was
a
wise
man
a
very
wise
man
he
droned
he
foresaw
what
your
pleasure
would
be
and
left
a
letter
for
you
but
before
i
read
it
before
i
invite
you
to
the
board
he
ordered
to
be
spread
for
you
in
honor
of
this
happy
occasion
there
is
one
appeal
he
bade
me
make
to
those
i
should
find
assembled
here
as
you
know
he
was
not
personally
acquainted
with
all
the
children
and
grandchildren
of
his
many
brothers
and
sisters
salmon
sons
for
instance
were
perfect
strangers
to
him
and
all
those
boys
and
girls
of
the
evans
branch
have
never
been
long
enough
this
side
of
the
mountains
for
him
to
know
their
names
much
less
their
temper
or
their
lives
yet
his
heirs
or
such
was
his
wish
his
great
wish
must
be
honest
men
righteous
in
their
dealings
and
of
stainless
lives
if
therefore
any
one
among
you
feels
that
for
reasons
he
need
not
state
he
has
no
right
to
accept
his
share
of
anthony
westonhaugh
bounty
then
that
person
is
requested
to
withdraw
before
this
letter
to
his
heirs
is
read
withdraw
was
the
man
a
fool
these
cormorants
these
suckers
of
blood
these
harpies
and
vultures
i
laughed
as
i
imagined
sneaking
hector
malicious
luke
or
brutal
john
responding
to
this
naïve
appeal
and
then
found
myself
wondering
why
no
echo
of
my
mirth
came
from
the
men
themselves
they
must
have
seen
much
more
plainly
than
i
did
the
ludicrousness
of
their
weak
old
kinsman
demand
yet
luke
was
still
hector
was
still
and
even
john
and
the
three
or
four
others
i
have
mentioned
gave
forth
no
audible
token
of
disdain
or
surprise
i
was
asking
myself
what
sentiment
of
awe
or
fear
restrained
these
selfish
souls
when
i
became
conscious
of
a
movement
within
which
presently
resolved
itself
into
a
departing
some
conscience
there
had
been
awakened
some
one
was
crossing
the
floor
toward
the
door
who
i
waited
in
anxious
expectancy
for
the
word
which
was
to
enlighten
me
happily
it
came
soon
and
from
the
old
lips
you
do
not
feel
yourself
worthy
he
queried
in
tones
i
had
not
heard
from
him
before
why
what
have
you
done
that
you
should
forego
an
inheritance
to
which
these
others
feel
themselves
honestly
entitled
the
voice
which
answered
gave
both
my
mind
and
heart
a
shock
it
was
who
had
risen
at
this
call
the
only
person
there
anxiously
i
listened
for
her
reply
alas
it
was
one
of
action
rather
than
speech
as
i
afterward
heard
she
simply
opened
her
long
cloak
and
showed
a
little
infant
slumbering
in
her
arms
this
is
my
reason
said
she
i
have
sinned
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
therefore
i
can
not
take
my
share
of
uncle
anthony
money
i
did
not
know
he
exacted
an
unblemished
record
from
those
he
expected
to
enrich
or
i
would
not
have
come
the
sob
which
followed
these
last
words
showed
at
what
a
cost
she
thus
renounced
a
fortune
of
which
she
of
all
present
perhaps
stood
in
the
greatest
need
but
there
was
no
lingering
in
her
step
and
to
me
who
understood
her
fault
only
through
the
faint
sound
of
infantile
wailing
which
accompanied
her
departure
there
was
a
nobility
in
her
action
which
raised
her
in
an
instant
to
an
almost
ideal
height
of
unselfish
virtue
perhaps
they
felt
this
too
perhaps
even
these
hardened
men
and
the
more
than
hardened
woman
whose
presence
was
in
itself
a
blight
recognized
heroism
when
they
saw
it
for
when
the
lawyer
with
a
certain
obvious
reluctance
laid
his
hand
on
the
bolts
of
the
door
with
the
remark
this
is
not
my
work
you
know
i
am
but
following
out
instructions
very
minutely
given
me
the
smothered
growls
and
grunts
which
rose
in
reply
lacked
the
venom
which
had
been
infused
into
all
their
previous
comments
i
think
our
friends
out
there
are
far
enough
withdrawn
by
this
time
for
us
to
hazard
the
opening
of
the
door
the
lawyer
now
remarked
madam
i
hope
you
will
speedily
find
your
way
to
some
comfortable
shelter
then
the
door
opened
and
after
a
moment
closed
again
in
a
silence
which
at
least
was
respectful
yet
i
warrant
there
was
not
a
soul
remaining
who
had
not
already
figured
in
his
mind
to
what
extent
his
own
fortune
had
been
increased
by
the
failure
of
one
of
their
number
to
inherit
as
for
me
my
whole
interest
in
the
affair
was
at
an
end
and
i
was
only
anxious
to
find
my
way
to
where
this
desolate
woman
faced
the
mist
with
her
unfed
baby
in
her
arms
iii
a
life
drama
but
to
reach
this
wanderer
it
was
first
necessary
for
me
to
escape
from
the
house
this
proved
simple
enough
the
room
toward
which
i
rushed
had
a
window
overlooking
one
of
the
many
already
mentioned
this
window
was
fastened
but
i
had
no
difficulty
in
unlocking
it
or
in
finding
my
way
to
the
ground
from
the
top
of
the
but
once
again
on
i
discovered
that
the
mist
was
now
so
thick
that
it
had
all
the
effect
of
a
fog
at
sea
it
was
icy
cold
as
well
and
clung
about
me
so
that
i
presently
began
to
shudder
most
violently
and
strong
man
though
i
was
wish
myself
back
in
the
little
attic
bedroom
from
which
i
had
climbed
in
search
of
one
in
more
unhappy
case
than
myself
but
these
feelings
did
not
cause
me
to
return
if
i
found
the
night
cold
she
must
find
it
bitter
if
desolation
oppressed
my
naturally
hopeful
spirit
must
it
not
be
more
overwhelming
yet
to
one
whose
memories
were
sad
and
whose
future
was
doubtful
and
the
child
what
infant
could
live
in
an
air
like
this
edging
away
from
the
house
i
called
out
her
name
but
no
answer
came
back
the
persons
whom
we
had
heard
flitting
in
restless
longing
about
the
house
a
few
moments
before
had
left
in
rage
and
she
possibly
with
them
yet
i
could
not
imagine
her
joining
herself
to
people
of
their
stamp
there
had
been
a
solitariness
in
her
aspect
which
seemed
to
forbid
any
such
companionship
whatever
her
story
at
least
she
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
two
persons
whose
faces
i
had
seen
looking
in
at
the
casement
no
i
should
find
her
alone
but
where
certainly
the
ring
of
mist
surrounding
me
at
that
moment
offered
me
little
prospect
of
finding
her
anywhere
either
easily
or
soon
again
i
raised
my
voice
and
again
i
failed
to
meet
with
response
then
fearing
to
leave
the
house
lest
i
should
be
quite
lost
amid
the
fences
and
brush
lying
between
it
and
the
road
i
began
to
feel
my
way
along
the
walls
calling
softly
now
instead
of
loudly
so
anxious
was
i
not
to
miss
any
chance
of
carrying
comfort
if
not
succor
to
the
woman
i
was
seeking
but
the
night
gave
back
no
sound
and
when
i
came
to
the
open
door
of
a
shed
i
welcomed
the
refuge
it
offered
and
stepped
in
i
was
of
course
confronted
by
darkness
a
different
darkness
from
that
without
and
impenetrable
but
when
after
a
moment
of
intense
listening
i
heard
a
soft
sound
as
of
weariful
breathing
i
was
seized
anew
by
hope
and
feeling
in
my
pocket
for
my
i
made
a
light
and
looked
around
my
intuitions
had
not
deceived
me
she
was
there
sitting
on
the
floor
with
her
cheek
pressed
against
the
wall
she
revealed
to
my
eager
scrutiny
only
the
outlines
of
her
pure
pale
profile
but
in
those
outlines
and
on
those
pure
pale
features
i
saw
such
an
abandonment
of
hope
mingled
with
such
quiet
endurance
that
my
whole
soul
melted
before
it
and
it
was
with
difficulty
i
managed
to
say
pardon
i
do
not
wish
to
intrude
but
i
am
shut
out
of
the
house
also
and
the
night
is
raw
and
cold
can
i
do
nothing
for
your
comfort
or
for
for
the
child
she
turned
toward
me
and
i
saw
a
tremulous
gleam
of
pleasure
disturb
the
somber
stillness
of
her
face
then
the
match
went
out
in
my
hand
and
we
were
again
in
complete
darkness
but
the
little
wail
which
at
the
same
instant
rose
from
between
her
arms
filled
up
the
pause
as
her
sweet
hush
filled
my
heart
i
am
used
to
the
cold
came
in
another
moment
from
the
place
where
she
crouched
it
is
the
child
she
is
hungry
and
i
i
walked
here
feeling
hoping
that
as
my
father
heir
i
might
partake
in
some
slight
measure
of
uncle
anthony
money
though
my
father
cast
me
out
before
he
died
and
i
have
neither
home
nor
money
i
do
not
complain
i
forfeited
all
when
another
wail
another
gentle
hush
then
silence
i
lit
another
match
look
in
my
face
i
prayed
i
am
a
stranger
and
you
would
be
showing
only
proper
prudence
not
to
trust
me
but
i
overheard
your
words
when
you
withdrew
from
the
room
where
your
fortune
lay
and
i
honor
you
madam
if
food
can
be
got
for
your
little
one
i
will
get
it
i
caught
sight
of
the
convulsive
clasp
with
which
she
drew
to
her
breast
the
tiny
bundle
she
held
then
darkness
fell
again
a
little
bread
she
entreated
a
little
milk
ah
baby
baby
hush
but
where
can
i
get
it
i
cried
they
are
at
table
inside
i
hear
them
shouting
over
their
good
cheer
but
perhaps
there
are
neighbors
near
by
do
you
know
there
are
no
neighbors
she
replied
what
is
got
must
be
got
here
i
know
a
way
to
the
kitchen
i
used
to
visit
uncle
anthony
when
a
little
child
if
you
have
the
courage
i
laughed
this
token
of
confidence
seemed
to
reassure
her
i
heard
her
move
possibly
she
stood
up
in
the
further
corner
of
this
shed
said
she
there
used
to
be
a
trap
connecting
this
floor
with
an
underground
a
ladder
stood
against
the
trap
and
the
small
cellar
at
the
foot
communicated
by
means
of
an
door
with
the
large
one
under
the
house
eighteen
years
ago
the
wood
of
that
door
was
old
now
it
should
be
rotten
if
you
have
the
strength
i
will
make
the
effort
and
see
said
i
but
when
i
am
in
the
cellar
what
then
follow
the
wall
to
the
right
you
will
come
to
a
stone
staircase
as
this
staircase
has
no
railing
be
careful
in
ascending
it
at
the
top
you
will
find
a
door
it
leads
into
a
pantry
adjoining
the
kitchen
some
one
will
be
in
that
pantry
some
one
will
give
you
a
bite
for
the
child
and
when
she
is
quieted
and
the
sun
has
risen
i
will
go
away
it
is
my
duty
to
do
so
my
uncle
was
always
upright
if
cold
he
was
perfectly
justified
in
exacting
rectitude
in
his
heirs
i
might
have
rejoined
by
asking
if
she
detected
rectitude
in
the
faces
of
the
greedy
throng
she
had
left
behind
her
with
the
guardian
of
this
estate
but
i
did
not
i
was
too
intent
upon
following
out
her
directions
lighting
another
match
i
sought
the
trap
alas
it
was
burdened
with
a
pile
of
sticks
and
rubbish
which
looked
as
if
they
had
lain
there
for
years
as
these
had
to
be
removed
in
total
darkness
it
took
me
some
time
but
once
this
debris
had
been
scattered
and
thrown
aside
i
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
trap
and
as
the
ladder
was
still
there
i
was
soon
on
the
when
by
the
reassuring
shout
i
gave
she
knew
that
i
had
advanced
thus
far
she
spoke
and
her
voice
had
a
soft
and
thrilling
sound
do
not
forget
your
own
needs
she
said
we
two
are
not
so
hungry
that
we
can
not
wait
for
you
to
take
a
mouthful
i
will
sing
to
the
baby
these
ten
minutes
we
had
spent
together
had
made
us
friends
the
warmth
the
strength
which
this
discovery
brought
gave
to
my
arm
a
force
that
made
that
old
oak
door
go
down
before
me
in
three
vigorous
pushes
had
the
eight
fortunate
ones
above
not
been
indulging
in
a
noisy
celebration
of
their
good
luck
they
must
have
heard
the
clatter
of
this
door
when
it
fell
but
good
eating
good
drink
and
the
prospect
of
an
immediate
fortune
far
beyond
their
wildest
dreams
made
all
ears
deaf
and
no
pause
occurred
in
the
shouts
of
laughter
and
the
hum
of
which
sifted
down
between
the
beams
supporting
the
house
above
my
head
consequently
little
or
no
courage
was
required
for
the
completion
of
my
adventure
and
before
long
i
came
upon
the
staircase
and
the
door
leading
from
its
top
into
the
pantry
the
next
minute
i
was
in
front
of
that
door
but
here
a
surprise
awaited
me
the
noise
which
had
hitherto
been
loud
now
became
deafening
and
i
realized
that
contrary
to
eunice
westonhaugh
expectation
the
supper
had
been
spread
in
the
kitchen
and
that
i
was
likely
to
run
amuck
of
the
whole
despicable
crowd
in
any
effort
i
might
make
to
get
a
bite
for
the
famished
baby
i
therefore
naturally
hesitated
to
push
open
the
door
fearing
to
draw
attention
to
myself
and
when
i
did
succeed
in
lifting
the
latch
and
making
a
small
crack
i
was
so
astonished
by
the
sudden
lull
in
the
general
babble
that
i
drew
hastily
back
and
was
for
descending
the
stairs
in
sudden
retreat
but
i
was
prevented
from
carrying
out
this
cowardly
impulse
by
catching
the
sound
of
the
lawyer
voice
addressing
the
assembled
guests
you
have
eaten
and
you
have
drunk
he
was
saying
you
are
therefore
ready
for
the
final
toast
brothers
nephews
heirs
all
of
anthony
westonhaugh
i
rise
to
propose
the
name
of
your
generous
benefactor
who
if
spirits
walk
this
earth
must
certainly
be
with
us
a
grumble
from
more
than
one
throat
and
an
uneasy
hitch
from
such
shoulders
as
i
could
see
through
my
narrow
testified
to
the
rather
doubtful
pleasure
with
which
this
suggestion
was
received
but
the
lawyer
tones
lost
none
of
their
animation
as
he
went
on
to
say
the
bottle
from
which
your
glasses
are
to
be
replenished
for
this
final
draft
he
has
himself
provided
so
anxious
was
he
that
it
should
be
of
the
very
best
and
altogether
worthy
of
the
occasion
it
is
to
celebrate
that
he
gave
into
my
charge
almost
with
his
dying
breath
this
key
telling
me
that
it
would
unlock
a
cupboard
here
in
which
he
had
placed
a
bottle
of
wine
of
the
very
rarest
vintage
this
is
the
key
and
yonder
if
i
do
not
mistake
is
the
cupboard
they
had
already
quaffed
a
dozen
toasts
perhaps
this
was
why
they
accepted
this
proposition
in
a
sort
of
panting
silence
which
remained
unbroken
while
the
lawyer
crossed
the
floor
unlocked
the
cupboard
and
brought
out
before
them
a
bottle
which
he
held
up
before
their
eyes
with
a
simulated
glee
almost
saturnine
is
that
a
bottle
to
make
your
eyes
dance
the
very
cobwebs
on
it
are
eloquent
and
see
look
at
this
label
tokay
friends
real
tokay
how
many
of
you
ever
had
the
opportunity
of
drinking
real
tokay
before
a
long
deep
sigh
from
a
throats
in
which
some
strong
but
hitherto
repressed
passion
totally
incomprehensible
to
me
found
sudden
vent
rose
in
one
simultaneous
sound
from
about
that
table
and
i
heard
one
jocular
voice
sing
out
pass
it
around
smead
i
drink
to
uncle
anthony
out
of
that
bottle
till
there
is
a
drop
left
to
tell
what
was
in
it
but
the
lawyer
was
in
no
hurry
you
have
forgotten
the
letter
for
the
hearing
of
which
you
are
called
together
anthony
westonhaugh
left
behind
him
a
letter
the
time
is
now
come
for
reading
it
as
i
heard
these
words
and
realized
that
the
final
toast
was
to
be
delayed
and
that
some
few
moments
must
yet
elapse
before
the
room
would
be
cleared
and
an
opportunity
given
me
for
obtaining
what
i
needed
for
the
famishing
mother
and
child
i
felt
such
impatience
with
the
fact
and
so
much
anxiety
as
to
the
condition
of
those
i
had
left
behind
me
that
i
questioned
whether
it
would
not
be
better
for
me
to
return
to
them
than
to
leave
them
so
long
without
the
comfort
of
my
presence
when
the
fascination
of
the
scene
again
seized
me
and
i
found
myself
lingering
to
mark
its
conclusion
with
an
avidity
which
can
only
be
explained
by
my
sudden
and
intense
consciousness
of
what
it
all
might
mean
to
her
whose
witness
i
had
thus
inadvertently
become
the
careful
lawyer
began
by
quoting
the
injunction
with
which
this
letter
had
been
put
in
his
hands
they
are
warm
with
food
and
wine
but
not
too
warm
thus
his
adjuration
ran
let
them
hear
my
first
and
only
words
to
them
i
know
you
are
eager
for
these
words
folk
so
honest
so
convinced
of
their
own
purity
and
uprightness
that
they
can
stand
unmoved
while
the
youngest
and
most
helpless
among
them
withdraws
her
claim
to
wealth
and
independence
rather
than
share
an
unmerited
bounty
such
folk
i
say
must
be
eager
must
be
anxious
to
know
why
they
have
been
made
the
legatees
of
so
great
a
fortune
under
the
easy
conditions
and
amid
such
slight
restrictions
as
have
been
imposed
upon
them
by
their
munificent
kinsman
i
had
rather
go
on
drinking
toasts
babbled
one
thick
voice
i
had
rather
finish
my
figuring
growled
another
in
whose
grating
tones
no
echo
remained
of
hector
westonhaugh
formerly
honeyed
voice
i
am
making
out
a
list
of
stock
blast
your
stock
that
is
if
you
mean
horses
and
cows
screamed
a
third
i
going
in
for
city
life
with
less
money
than
we
have
got
andreas
amsberger
got
to
be
alderman
alderman
sneered
the
whole
pack
and
the
tumult
became
general
if
more
of
us
had
been
sick
called
out
one
or
if
uncle
luke
say
had
tripped
into
the
ditch
instead
of
on
the
edge
of
it
the
fellows
who
came
safe
through
might
have
had
anything
they
wanted
even
to
the
governorship
of
the
state
or
or
silence
came
in
commanding
tones
from
the
lawyer
who
had
begun
to
let
his
disgust
appear
perhaps
because
he
held
under
his
thumb
the
bottle
upon
which
all
eyes
were
now
lovingly
centered
so
lovingly
indeed
that
i
ventured
to
increase
in
the
smallest
perceptible
degree
the
crack
by
means
of
which
i
was
myself
an
interested
if
unseen
participator
in
this
scene
a
sight
of
smead
and
a
partial
glimpse
of
old
luke
covetous
profile
rewarded
this
small
act
of
daring
on
my
part
the
lawyer
was
standing
all
the
rest
were
sitting
perhaps
he
alone
retained
sufficient
steadiness
to
stand
for
i
observed
by
the
control
he
exercised
over
this
herd
of
that
he
alone
had
not
touched
the
cup
which
had
so
freely
gone
about
among
the
others
the
woman
was
hidden
from
me
but
the
change
in
her
voice
when
by
any
chance
i
heard
it
convinced
me
that
she
had
not
disdained
the
toasts
drunk
by
her
brothers
and
nephews
silence
the
lawyer
reiterated
or
i
will
smash
this
bottle
on
the
hearth
he
raised
it
in
one
threatening
hand
and
every
man
there
seemed
to
tremble
while
old
luke
put
out
his
long
fingers
with
an
entreaty
that
ill
became
them
you
want
to
hear
the
letter
old
smead
called
out
i
thought
so
putting
the
bottle
down
again
but
still
keeping
one
hand
upon
it
he
drew
a
folded
paper
from
his
breast
this
said
he
contains
the
final
injunctions
of
anthony
westonhaugh
you
will
listen
all
of
you
listen
till
i
am
done
or
i
will
not
only
smash
this
bottle
before
your
eyes
but
i
will
keep
for
ever
buried
in
my
breast
the
whereabouts
of
certain
drafts
and
bonds
in
which
as
his
heirs
you
possess
the
greatest
interest
nobody
but
myself
knows
where
these
papers
can
be
found
whether
this
was
so
or
whether
the
threat
was
an
empty
one
thrown
out
by
this
subtile
old
schemer
for
the
purpose
of
safeguarding
his
life
from
their
possible
hate
and
impatience
it
answered
his
end
with
these
men
and
secured
him
the
silence
he
demanded
breaking
open
the
seal
of
the
envelope
he
held
he
showed
them
the
folded
sheet
which
it
contained
with
the
remark
i
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
writing
of
this
letter
it
is
in
westonhaugh
own
hand
and
he
was
not
even
so
good
as
to
communicate
to
me
the
nature
of
its
contents
i
was
bidden
to
read
it
to
such
as
should
be
here
assembled
under
the
provisos
mentioned
in
his
will
and
as
you
are
now
in
a
condition
to
listen
i
will
proceed
with
my
task
as
required
this
was
my
time
for
leaving
but
a
certain
brooding
terror
latent
in
the
air
held
me
chained
to
the
spot
listening
with
my
ears
but
receiving
the
full
sense
of
what
was
read
from
the
expression
of
old
luke
face
which
was
probably
more
plainly
visible
to
me
than
to
those
who
sat
beside
him
for
being
bent
almost
into
a
bow
as
i
have
said
his
forehead
came
within
an
inch
of
touching
his
plate
and
one
had
to
look
under
his
arms
as
i
did
to
catch
the
workings
of
his
evil
mouth
as
old
smead
gave
forth
in
his
professional
the
following
words
from
his
departed
client
brothers
nephews
and
heirs
though
the
earth
has
lain
upon
my
breast
a
month
i
am
with
you
here
a
snort
from
old
luke
snarling
lips
and
a
stir
not
a
comfortable
one
in
the
jostling
crowd
whose
shaking
arms
and
clawing
hands
i
could
see
projecting
here
and
there
over
the
board
my
presence
at
this
feast
a
presence
which
if
unseen
can
not
be
unfelt
may
bring
you
more
pain
than
pleasure
but
if
so
it
matters
little
you
are
my
natural
heirs
and
i
have
left
you
my
money
why
when
so
little
love
has
characterized
our
intercourse
must
be
evident
to
such
of
my
brothers
as
can
recall
their
youth
and
the
promise
our
father
exacted
from
us
on
the
day
we
set
foot
in
this
new
land
there
were
nine
of
us
in
those
days
luke
salmon
barbara
hector
eustace
janet
hudson
william
and
myself
and
all
save
one
were
promising
in
appearance
at
least
but
our
father
knew
his
offspring
and
when
we
stood
an
alien
and
miserable
band
in
front
of
castle
garden
at
the
foot
of
the
great
city
whose
immensity
struck
terror
to
our
hearts
he
drew
all
our
hands
together
and
made
us
swear
by
the
soul
of
our
mother
whose
body
we
had
left
in
the
sea
that
we
would
keep
the
bond
of
brotherhood
intact
and
share
with
mutual
confidence
whatever
good
fortune
this
untried
country
might
hold
in
store
for
us
you
were
strong
and
your
voices
rang
out
loudly
mine
was
faint
for
i
was
weak
so
weak
that
my
hand
had
to
be
held
in
place
by
my
sister
barbara
but
my
oath
has
never
lost
its
hold
upon
my
heart
while
yours
answer
how
you
have
kept
it
luke
or
you
janet
or
you
hector
of
the
smooth
tongue
and
vicious
heart
or
you
or
you
who
from
one
stock
recognize
but
one
law
the
law
of
selfishness
which
seeks
its
own
in
face
of
all
oaths
and
at
the
cost
of
another
man
this
i
say
to
such
as
know
my
story
but
lest
there
be
one
amongst
you
who
has
not
heard
from
parent
or
uncle
the
true
tale
of
him
who
has
brought
you
all
under
one
roof
i
will
repeat
it
here
in
words
that
no
man
may
fail
to
understand
why
i
remembered
my
oath
through
life
and
beyond
death
yet
stand
above
you
an
accusing
spirit
while
you
quaff
me
toasts
and
count
the
gains
my
justice
divides
among
you
i
as
you
all
remember
was
the
weak
one
the
when
all
of
you
were
grown
and
had
homes
of
your
own
i
still
remained
under
the
family
fed
by
our
father
bounty
and
looking
to
our
justice
for
that
share
of
his
savings
which
he
had
promised
to
all
alike
when
he
died
it
came
to
me
as
it
came
to
you
but
i
had
married
before
that
day
married
not
like
the
rest
of
you
for
what
a
wife
could
bring
but
for
sentiment
and
true
passion
this
in
my
case
meant
a
loving
wife
but
a
frail
one
and
while
we
lived
a
little
while
on
the
patrimony
left
us
it
was
far
too
small
to
support
us
long
without
some
aid
from
our
own
hands
and
our
hands
were
feeble
and
could
not
work
and
so
we
fell
into
debt
for
rent
and
ere
long
for
the
commonest
necessities
of
life
in
vain
i
struggled
to
redeem
myself
the
time
of
my
prosperity
had
not
come
and
i
only
sank
deeper
and
deeper
into
debt
and
finally
into
indigence
a
baby
came
our
landlord
was
kind
and
allowed
us
to
stay
for
two
weeks
under
the
roof
for
whose
protection
we
could
not
pay
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
we
were
asked
to
leave
and
i
found
myself
on
the
road
with
a
dying
wife
a
wailing
infant
no
money
in
my
purse
and
no
power
in
my
arm
to
earn
any
then
when
heart
and
hope
were
both
failing
i
recalled
that
ancient
oath
and
the
six
prosperous
homes
scattered
up
and
down
the
very
highway
on
which
i
stood
i
could
not
leave
my
wife
the
fever
was
in
her
veins
and
she
could
not
bear
me
out
of
her
sight
so
i
put
her
on
a
horse
which
a
kind
old
neighbor
was
willing
to
lend
me
and
holding
her
up
with
one
hand
guided
the
horse
with
the
other
to
the
home
of
my
brother
luke
he
was
a
straight
enough
fellow
in
those
days
physically
i
mean
and
he
looked
able
and
strong
that
morning
as
he
stood
in
the
open
doorway
of
his
house
gazing
down
at
us
as
we
halted
before
him
in
the
roadway
but
his
temper
had
grown
greedy
with
the
accumulation
of
a
few
dollars
and
he
shook
his
head
as
he
closed
his
door
saying
he
remembered
no
oath
and
that
spenders
must
expect
to
be
beggars
struck
to
the
heart
by
a
rebuff
which
meant
prolongation
of
the
suffering
i
saw
in
my
dear
wife
eyes
i
stretched
up
and
kissed
her
where
she
sat
on
the
horse
then
i
moved
on
i
came
to
barbara
home
next
she
had
been
a
little
mother
to
me
once
that
is
she
had
fed
and
dressed
me
and
doled
out
blows
and
caresses
and
taught
me
to
read
and
sing
but
barbara
in
her
father
home
and
without
fortune
was
not
the
barbara
i
saw
on
the
threshold
of
the
little
cottage
she
called
her
own
she
heard
my
story
looked
in
the
face
of
my
wife
and
turned
her
back
she
had
no
place
for
idle
folk
in
her
little
house
if
we
would
work
she
would
feed
us
but
we
must
earn
our
supper
or
go
hungry
to
bed
i
felt
the
trembling
of
my
wife
frame
where
she
leaned
against
my
arm
and
kissing
her
again
led
her
on
to
salmon
luke
hector
janet
have
you
heard
him
tell
of
that
vision
at
his
gateway
years
ago
he
is
not
amongst
you
for
twelve
years
he
has
lain
beside
our
father
in
the
churchyard
but
his
sons
may
be
here
for
they
were
ever
alert
when
gold
was
in
sight
or
a
full
glass
to
be
drained
ask
ask
john
whom
i
saw
skulking
behind
his
cousins
at
the
garden
fence
that
day
what
it
was
they
saw
as
i
drew
rein
under
the
great
tree
which
shadowed
their
father
doorstep
the
sunshine
had
been
pitiless
that
morning
and
the
head
for
whose
rest
in
some
loving
shelter
i
would
have
bartered
soul
and
body
had
fallen
sidewise
till
it
lay
on
my
arm
pressed
to
her
breast
was
our
infant
whose
little
wail
struck
in
pitifully
as
salmon
called
out
to
do
here
do
you
remember
it
lads
or
how
you
all
laughed
little
and
great
when
i
asked
for
a
few
weeks
stay
under
my
brother
roof
till
we
could
all
get
well
and
go
about
our
tasks
again
remember
i
who
am
writing
these
words
from
the
very
mouth
of
the
tomb
remember
but
i
did
not
curse
you
i
only
rode
on
to
the
next
the
way
ran
uphill
now
and
the
sun
which
since
our
last
stop
had
been
under
a
cloud
came
out
and
blistered
my
wife
cheeks
already
burning
red
with
fever
but
i
pressed
my
lips
upon
them
and
led
her
on
with
each
rebuff
i
gave
her
a
kiss
and
her
smile
as
her
head
pressed
harder
and
harder
upon
my
arm
now
exerting
all
its
strength
to
support
her
grew
almost
divine
but
it
vanished
at
my
nephew
lemuel
he
was
shearing
sheep
and
could
give
no
time
to
company
and
when
late
in
the
day
i
drew
rein
at
janet
and
she
said
she
was
going
to
have
a
dance
and
could
not
look
after
sick
folk
the
pallid
lips
failed
to
return
my
despairing
embrace
and
in
the
terror
which
this
brought
me
i
went
down
in
the
gathering
twilight
into
the
deep
valley
where
william
raised
his
sheep
and
reckoned
day
by
day
the
increase
among
his
pigs
oh
the
chill
of
that
descent
oh
the
gloom
of
the
gathering
shadows
as
we
neared
the
bottom
and
i
heard
a
voice
shout
out
a
hoarse
command
some
instinct
made
me
reach
up
for
the
last
time
and
bestow
that
faithful
kiss
which
was
at
once
her
consolation
and
my
prayer
my
lips
were
cold
with
the
terror
of
my
soul
but
they
were
not
so
cold
as
the
cheek
they
touched
and
shrieking
in
my
misery
and
need
i
fell
before
william
where
he
halted
by
the
and
he
was
always
a
hard
man
was
william
and
it
was
a
shock
to
him
no
doubt
to
see
us
standing
in
our
anguish
and
necessity
before
him
but
he
raised
the
whip
in
his
hand
and
when
it
fell
my
arm
fell
with
it
and
she
slipped
from
my
grasp
to
the
ground
and
lay
in
a
heap
in
the
roadway
he
was
ashamed
next
minute
and
pointed
to
the
house
but
i
did
not
carry
her
in
and
she
died
in
the
roadway
do
you
remember
it
luke
do
you
remember
it
lemuel
but
it
is
not
of
this
i
complain
at
this
hour
nor
is
it
for
this
i
ask
you
to
drink
the
toast
i
have
prepared
for
you
the
looks
the
writhings
of
old
luke
and
such
others
as
i
could
now
see
through
the
widening
crack
my
hands
unconsciously
made
in
the
doorway
told
me
that
the
rack
was
at
work
in
this
room
so
lately
given
up
to
revelry
yet
the
mutterings
which
from
time
to
time
came
to
my
ears
from
one
sullen
lip
or
another
did
not
rise
into
frightened
imprecation
or
even
into
any
assertion
of
sorrow
or
contrition
it
seemed
as
if
some
suspense
common
to
all
held
them
speechless
if
not
dumbly
apprehensive
and
while
the
lawyer
said
nothing
in
recognition
of
this
he
could
not
have
been
quite
blind
to
it
for
he
bestowed
one
curious
glance
around
the
table
before
he
proceeded
with
old
anthony
words
those
words
had
now
become
short
sharp
and
accusatory
my
child
lived
and
what
remained
to
me
of
human
passion
and
longing
centered
in
his
frail
existence
i
managed
to
earn
enough
for
his
eating
and
housing
and
in
time
i
was
almost
happy
again
this
was
while
our
existence
was
a
struggle
but
when
with
the
discovery
of
latent
powers
in
my
own
mind
i
began
to
find
my
place
in
the
world
and
to
earn
money
then
your
sudden
interest
in
my
boy
taught
me
a
new
lesson
in
human
selfishness
but
not
as
yet
new
fears
my
nature
was
not
one
to
grasp
ideas
of
evil
and
the
remembrance
of
that
oath
still
remained
to
make
me
lenient
toward
you
i
let
him
see
you
not
much
not
often
but
yet
often
enough
for
him
to
realize
that
he
had
uncles
and
cousins
or
if
you
like
it
better
kindred
and
how
did
you
repay
this
confidence
on
my
part
what
hand
had
ye
in
the
removal
of
this
small
barrier
to
the
fortune
my
own
poor
health
warranted
you
in
looking
upon
even
in
those
early
days
as
your
own
to
others
eyes
it
may
appear
none
to
mine
ye
are
one
and
all
his
murderers
as
certainly
as
all
of
you
were
the
murderers
of
the
good
physician
hastening
to
his
aid
for
his
illness
was
not
a
mortal
one
he
would
have
been
saved
if
the
doctor
had
reached
him
but
a
precipice
swallowed
that
good
samaritan
and
only
i
of
all
who
looked
upon
the
footprints
which
harrowed
up
the
road
at
this
dangerous
point
knew
whose
shoes
would
fit
those
marks
god
providence
it
was
called
and
i
let
it
pass
for
such
but
it
was
a
providence
which
cost
me
my
boy
and
made
my
heirs
silence
as
sullen
in
character
as
the
men
who
found
themselves
thus
openly
impeached
had
for
some
minutes
now
replaced
the
muttered
complaints
which
had
accompanied
the
first
portion
of
this
denunciatory
letter
as
the
lawyer
stopped
to
cast
them
another
of
those
strange
looks
a
gleam
from
old
luke
sidewise
eyes
startled
the
man
next
him
who
shrugging
a
shoulder
passed
the
underhanded
look
on
till
it
had
circled
the
board
and
stopped
with
the
man
sitting
opposite
the
crooked
sinner
who
had
started
it
i
began
to
have
a
wholesome
dread
of
them
all
and
was
astonished
to
see
the
lawyer
drop
his
hand
from
the
bottle
which
to
some
degree
offered
itself
as
a
possible
weapon
but
he
knew
his
audience
better
than
i
did
though
the
bottle
was
now
free
for
any
man
taking
not
a
hand
trembled
toward
it
nor
was
a
single
glass
held
out
the
lawyer
with
an
evil
smile
went
on
with
his
relentless
story
ye
had
killed
my
wife
ye
had
killed
my
son
but
this
was
not
enough
being
lonesome
in
my
great
house
which
was
as
much
too
large
for
me
as
my
fortune
was
i
had
taken
a
child
to
replace
the
boy
i
had
lost
remembering
the
cold
blood
running
in
the
veins
of
those
nearest
me
i
chose
a
boy
from
alien
stock
and
for
a
while
knew
contentment
again
but
as
he
developed
and
my
affections
strengthened
the
possibility
of
all
my
money
going
his
way
roused
my
brothers
and
sisters
from
the
complacency
they
had
enjoyed
since
their
road
to
fortune
had
been
secured
by
my
son
death
and
one
day
can
you
recall
it
hudson
can
you
recall
it
lemuel
the
boy
was
brought
in
from
the
mill
and
laid
at
my
feet
dead
he
had
stumbled
amongst
the
great
belts
but
whose
was
the
voice
which
had
startled
him
with
a
sudden
can
you
say
luke
can
you
say
john
i
can
say
in
whose
ear
it
was
whispered
that
three
if
not
more
of
you
were
seen
moving
among
the
machinery
that
fatal
morning
again
god
providence
was
said
to
have
visited
my
house
and
again
were
my
heirs
stop
there
broke
in
the
harsh
voice
of
luke
who
was
gradually
growing
livid
under
his
long
gray
locks
lies
lies
shrieked
hector
gathering
courage
from
his
brother
cut
it
all
and
give
us
the
drink
snarled
one
of
the
younger
men
who
was
less
under
the
effect
of
liquor
than
the
rest
but
a
trembling
voice
muttered
hush
and
the
lawyer
whose
eye
had
grown
steely
under
these
comments
took
advantage
of
the
sudden
silence
which
had
followed
this
last
objurgation
and
went
steadily
on
some
men
would
have
made
a
will
and
denounced
you
i
made
a
will
but
did
not
denounce
you
am
no
breaker
of
oaths
more
than
this
i
learned
a
new
trick
i
who
hated
all
subtlety
and
looked
upon
craft
as
the
favorite
weapon
of
the
devil
learned
to
smile
with
my
lips
while
my
heart
was
burning
with
hatred
perhaps
this
was
why
you
all
began
to
smile
too
and
joke
me
about
certain
losses
i
had
sustained
by
which
you
meant
the
gains
which
had
come
to
me
that
these
gains
were
many
times
greater
than
you
realized
added
to
the
sting
of
this
good
fellowship
but
i
held
my
peace
and
you
began
to
have
confidence
in
a
which
nothing
could
shake
you
even
gave
me
a
supper
supper
what
was
there
in
these
words
to
cause
every
man
there
to
stop
in
whatever
movement
he
was
making
and
stare
with
eyes
intently
at
the
reader
he
had
spoken
quietly
he
had
not
even
looked
up
but
the
silence
which
for
some
minutes
back
had
begun
to
reign
over
that
tumultuous
gathering
now
became
breathless
and
the
seams
in
cheeks
deepened
to
a
bluish
remember
that
supper
as
the
words
rang
out
again
i
threw
wide
the
door
i
might
have
stalked
openly
into
their
circle
not
a
man
there
would
have
noticed
me
it
was
a
memorable
occasion
the
lawyer
read
on
with
stoical
impassiveness
there
was
not
a
brother
lacking
luke
and
hudson
and
william
and
hector
and
eustace
boys
as
well
as
eustace
himself
janet
too
and
salmon
lemuel
and
barbara
son
who
even
if
his
mother
had
gone
the
way
of
all
flesh
had
so
trained
her
black
brood
in
the
love
of
the
things
of
this
world
that
i
scarcely
missed
her
when
i
looked
about
among
you
all
for
the
eight
sturdy
brothers
and
sisters
who
had
joined
in
one
clasp
and
one
oath
under
the
eye
of
the
immigrant
our
father
what
i
did
miss
was
one
true
eye
lifted
to
my
glance
but
i
did
not
show
that
i
missed
it
and
so
our
peace
was
made
and
we
separated
you
to
wait
for
your
inheritance
and
i
for
the
death
which
was
to
secure
it
to
you
for
when
the
cup
passed
round
that
night
you
each
dropped
into
it
a
tear
of
repentance
and
tears
make
bitter
drinking
i
sickened
as
i
quaffed
and
was
never
myself
again
as
you
know
do
you
understand
me
you
cruel
crafty
ones
did
they
not
heads
quaking
throats
gasping
teeth
chattering
no
longer
sitting
all
risen
all
looking
with
wild
eyes
for
the
door
was
it
not
apparent
that
they
understood
and
only
waited
for
one
more
word
to
break
away
and
flee
the
accursed
house
but
that
word
lingered
old
smead
had
now
grown
pale
himself
and
read
with
difficulty
the
lines
which
were
to
end
this
frightful
scene
as
i
saw
the
red
gleam
of
terror
shine
out
from
his
small
eyes
i
wondered
if
he
had
been
but
the
blind
tool
of
his
implacable
client
and
was
as
ignorant
as
those
before
him
of
what
was
to
follow
this
heavy
arraignment
the
dread
with
which
he
finally
proceeded
was
too
marked
for
me
to
doubt
the
truth
of
this
surmise
this
is
what
he
found
himself
forced
to
read
there
was
a
bottle
reserved
for
me
it
had
a
green
label
on
it
a
shriek
from
every
one
there
and
a
hurried
look
up
and
down
at
the
bottles
standing
on
the
table
a
green
label
the
lawyer
repeated
and
it
made
a
goodly
appearance
as
it
was
set
down
before
me
but
you
had
no
liking
for
wine
with
a
green
label
on
the
bottle
one
by
one
you
refused
it
and
when
i
rose
to
quaff
my
final
glass
alone
every
eye
before
me
fell
and
did
not
lift
again
until
the
glass
was
drained
i
did
not
notice
this
then
but
i
see
it
all
now
just
as
i
hear
again
the
excuses
you
gave
for
not
filling
your
glasses
as
the
bottle
went
round
one
had
drunk
enough
one
suffered
from
qualms
brought
on
by
an
unaccustomed
indulgence
in
oysters
one
felt
that
wine
good
enough
for
me
was
too
good
for
him
and
so
on
and
so
on
not
one
to
show
frank
eyes
and
drink
with
me
as
i
was
ready
to
drink
with
him
why
because
one
and
all
of
you
knew
what
was
in
that
cup
and
would
not
risk
an
inheritance
so
nearly
within
your
grasp
lies
lies
again
shrieked
the
raucous
voice
of
luke
smothered
by
terror
while
oaths
shouts
imprecations
rang
out
in
horrid
tumult
from
one
end
of
the
table
to
the
other
till
the
lawyer
face
over
which
a
startling
change
was
rapidly
passing
drew
the
whole
crowd
forward
again
in
awful
fascination
till
they
clung
speechless
arm
in
arm
shoulder
propping
shoulder
while
he
gasped
out
in
dismay
equal
to
their
own
these
last
fatal
words
that
was
at
your
board
my
brothers
now
you
are
at
mine
you
have
eaten
my
viands
drunk
of
my
cup
and
now
through
the
mouth
of
the
one
man
who
has
been
true
to
me
because
therein
lies
his
advantage
i
offer
you
a
final
glass
will
you
drink
it
i
drank
yours
by
that
oath
which
binds
us
to
share
each
other
fortune
i
ask
you
to
share
this
cup
with
me
will
not
no
no
no
shouted
one
after
another
then
the
inexorable
voice
went
on
a
voice
which
to
these
miserable
souls
was
no
longer
that
of
the
lawyer
but
an
issue
from
the
grave
they
had
themselves
dug
for
anthony
westonhaugh
know
that
your
abstinence
comes
too
late
that
you
have
already
drunk
the
toast
destined
to
end
your
lives
the
bottle
which
you
must
have
missed
from
that
board
of
yours
has
been
offered
you
again
a
label
is
easily
changed
and
luke
john
hector
i
know
you
all
so
well
that
bottle
has
been
greedily
emptied
by
you
and
while
i
who
sipped
sparingly
lived
three
weeks
you
who
have
drunk
deep
not
three
hours
before
you
possibly
not
three
o
the
wail
of
those
lost
souls
as
this
last
sentence
issued
in
a
final
pant
of
horror
from
the
lawyer
quaking
lips
shrieks
howls
prayers
for
mercy
groans
to
make
the
hair
rise
and
curses
at
sound
of
which
i
shut
my
ears
in
horror
only
to
open
them
again
in
dread
as
with
one
simultaneous
impulse
they
flung
themselves
upon
the
lawyer
who
foreseeing
this
rush
had
backed
up
against
the
wall
he
tried
to
stem
the
tide
i
knew
nothing
of
the
poisoning
he
protested
that
was
not
my
reason
for
declining
the
drink
i
wished
to
preserve
my
senses
to
carry
out
my
client
wishes
as
god
lives
i
did
not
know
he
meant
to
carry
his
revenge
so
far
mercy
mer
but
the
hands
which
clutched
him
were
the
hands
of
murderers
and
the
lawyer
puny
figure
could
not
stand
up
against
the
avalanche
of
human
terror
relentless
fury
and
mad
vengeance
which
now
rolled
in
upon
it
as
i
bounded
to
his
relief
he
turned
his
ghastly
face
upon
me
but
the
way
between
us
was
blocked
and
i
was
preparing
myself
to
see
him
sink
before
my
eyes
when
an
unearthly
shriek
rose
from
behind
us
and
every
living
soul
in
that
mass
of
struggling
humanity
paused
set
and
staring
with
stiffened
limbs
and
eyes
fixed
not
on
him
not
on
me
but
on
one
of
their
own
number
the
only
woman
amongst
them
janet
clapsaddle
who
with
clutching
hands
clawing
her
breast
was
reeling
in
solitary
agony
in
her
place
beside
the
board
as
they
looked
she
fell
and
lay
with
upturned
face
and
staring
eyes
in
whose
glassy
depths
the
ones
who
watched
her
could
see
mirrored
their
own
impending
doom
it
was
an
awful
moment
a
groan
in
which
was
concentrated
the
despair
of
seven
miserable
souls
rose
from
that
petrified
band
then
man
by
man
they
separated
and
fell
back
showing
on
each
weak
or
wicked
face
the
particular
passion
which
had
driven
them
into
crime
and
made
them
the
victims
of
this
wholesale
revenge
there
had
been
some
sort
of
bond
between
them
till
the
vision
of
death
rose
before
each
shrinking
soul
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
crime
they
fell
apart
as
their
doom
approached
and
rushing
shrieking
each
man
for
himself
they
one
and
all
sought
to
escape
by
doors
windows
or
any
outlet
which
promised
release
from
this
fatal
spot
one
rushed
by
me
i
do
not
know
which
one
and
i
felt
as
if
a
flame
from
hell
had
licked
me
his
breath
was
so
hot
and
the
moans
he
uttered
so
like
the
curses
we
imagine
to
blister
the
lips
of
the
lost
none
of
them
saw
me
they
did
not
even
detect
the
sliding
form
of
the
lawyer
crawling
away
before
them
to
some
place
of
egress
of
which
they
had
no
knowledge
and
convinced
that
in
this
scene
of
death
i
could
play
no
part
worthy
of
her
who
awaited
me
i
too
rushed
away
and
groping
my
way
back
through
the
cellar
sought
the
side
of
her
who
still
crouched
in
patient
waiting
against
the
dismal
wall
iv
the
final
shock
her
baby
had
fallen
asleep
i
knew
this
by
the
faint
low
sweetness
of
her
croon
and
shuddering
with
the
horrors
i
had
witnessed
horrors
which
acquired
a
double
force
from
the
contrast
presented
by
the
peace
of
this
quiet
spot
and
the
hallowing
influence
of
the
sleeping
infant
i
threw
myself
down
in
the
darkness
at
her
feet
gasping
out
oh
thank
god
and
your
uncle
seeming
harshness
that
you
have
escaped
the
doom
which
has
overtaken
those
others
you
and
your
babe
are
still
alive
while
they
what
of
them
what
has
happened
to
them
you
are
breathless
trembling
you
have
brought
no
bread
no
no
food
in
this
house
means
death
your
relatives
gave
food
and
wine
to
your
uncle
at
a
supper
he
though
now
in
his
grave
has
returned
the
same
to
them
there
was
a
bottle
i
stopped
appalled
a
shriek
muffled
by
distance
but
quivering
with
the
same
note
of
death
i
had
heard
before
had
gone
up
again
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
against
which
we
were
leaning
oh
she
gasped
and
my
father
was
at
that
supper
my
father
who
died
last
night
cursing
the
day
he
was
born
we
are
an
accursed
race
i
have
known
it
all
my
life
perhaps
that
was
why
i
mistook
passion
for
love
and
my
baby
o
god
have
mercy
god
have
mercy
the
plaintiveness
of
that
cry
the
awesomeness
of
what
i
had
seen
of
what
was
going
on
at
that
moment
almost
within
the
reach
of
our
arms
the
darkness
the
desolation
of
our
two
souls
affected
me
as
i
had
never
been
affected
in
my
whole
life
before
in
the
concentrated
experience
of
the
last
two
hours
i
seemed
to
live
years
under
this
woman
eyes
to
know
her
as
i
did
my
own
heart
to
love
her
as
i
did
my
own
soul
no
growth
of
feeling
ever
brought
the
ecstasy
of
that
moment
inspiration
with
no
sense
of
doing
anything
strange
with
no
fear
of
being
misunderstood
i
reached
out
my
hand
and
touching
hers
where
it
lay
clasped
about
her
infant
i
said
we
are
two
poor
wayfarers
a
rough
road
loses
half
its
difficulties
when
trodden
by
two
shall
we
then
fare
on
together
we
and
the
little
child
she
gave
a
sob
there
was
sorrow
longing
grief
hope
in
its
thrilling
low
sound
as
i
recognized
the
latter
emotion
i
drew
her
to
my
breast
the
child
did
not
separate
us
we
shall
be
happy
i
murmured
and
her
sigh
seemed
to
answer
a
delicious
yes
when
suddenly
there
came
a
shock
to
the
partition
against
which
we
leaned
and
starting
from
my
clasp
she
cried
our
duty
is
in
there
shall
we
think
of
ourselves
or
even
of
each
other
while
these
men
all
relatives
of
mine
are
dying
on
the
other
side
of
this
wall
seizing
my
hand
she
dragged
me
to
the
trap
but
here
i
took
the
lead
and
helped
her
down
the
ladder
when
i
had
her
safely
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
she
passed
in
front
of
me
again
but
once
up
the
steps
and
in
front
of
the
kitchen
door
i
thrust
her
behind
me
for
one
glance
into
the
room
beyond
had
convinced
me
it
was
no
place
for
her
but
she
would
not
be
held
back
she
crowded
forward
beside
me
and
together
we
looked
upon
the
wreck
within
it
was
a
scene
the
demon
that
was
in
those
men
had
driven
them
to
demolish
furniture
dishes
everything
in
one
heap
lay
what
an
hour
before
had
been
an
inviting
board
surrounded
by
rollicking
and
greedy
guests
but
it
was
not
upon
this
overthrow
we
stopped
to
look
it
was
upon
something
that
mingled
with
it
dominated
it
and
made
of
this
chaos
only
a
setting
to
awful
death
janet
face
in
all
its
natural
hideousness
and
depravity
looked
up
from
the
floor
beside
this
heap
and
farther
on
the
twisted
figure
of
him
they
called
hector
with
something
more
than
the
seams
of
greedy
longing
round
his
wide
staring
eyes
and
icy
temples
two
in
this
room
and
on
the
threshold
of
the
one
beyond
a
moaning
third
who
sank
into
eternal
silence
as
we
approached
and
before
the
fireplace
in
the
great
room
a
horrible
crescent
that
had
once
been
aged
luke
upon
whom
we
had
no
sooner
turned
our
backs
than
we
caught
glimpses
here
and
there
of
other
prostrate
forms
which
moved
once
under
our
eyes
and
then
moved
no
more
one
only
still
stood
upright
and
he
was
the
man
whose
obtrusive
figure
and
sordid
expression
had
so
revolted
me
in
the
beginning
there
was
no
color
now
in
his
flabby
and
heavily
fallen
cheeks
the
eyes
in
whose
false
sheen
i
had
seen
so
much
of
evil
were
glazed
now
and
his
big
and
burly
frame
shook
the
door
it
pressed
against
he
was
staring
at
a
small
slip
of
paper
he
held
and
from
his
anxious
looks
appeared
to
miss
something
which
neither
of
us
had
power
to
supply
it
was
a
spectacle
to
make
devils
rejoice
and
mortals
fly
aghast
but
eunice
had
a
spirit
like
an
angel
and
drawing
near
him
she
said
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
cousin
john
he
started
looked
at
her
with
the
same
blank
gaze
he
had
hitherto
cast
at
the
wall
then
some
words
formed
on
his
working
lips
and
we
heard
i
can
not
reckon
i
was
never
good
at
figures
but
if
luke
is
gone
and
william
and
hector
and
barbara
boy
and
janet
much
does
that
leave
for
me
he
was
answered
almost
the
moment
he
spoke
but
it
was
by
other
tongues
and
in
another
world
than
this
as
his
body
fell
forward
i
tore
open
the
door
before
which
he
had
been
standing
and
lifting
the
almost
fainting
eunice
in
my
arms
i
carried
her
out
into
the
night
as
i
did
so
i
caught
a
final
glimpse
of
the
pictured
face
i
had
found
it
so
hard
to
understand
a
couple
of
hours
before
i
understood
it
now
a
surprise
awaited
us
as
we
turned
toward
the
gate
the
mist
had
lifted
and
a
keen
but
not
unpleasant
wind
was
driving
from
the
north
borne
on
it
we
heard
voices
the
village
had
emptied
itself
probably
at
the
alarm
given
by
the
lawyer
and
it
was
these
good
men
and
women
whose
approach
we
heard
as
we
had
nothing
to
fear
from
them
we
went
forward
to
meet
them
as
we
did
so
three
crouching
figures
rose
from
some
bushes
we
passed
and
ran
scurrying
before
us
through
the
gateway
they
were
the
late
comers
who
had
shown
such
despair
at
being
shut
out
from
this
fatal
house
and
who
probably
did
not
yet
know
the
doom
they
had
escaped
there
were
lanterns
in
the
hands
of
some
of
the
men
who
now
approached
as
we
stopped
before
them
these
lanterns
were
held
up
and
by
the
light
they
gave
we
saw
first
the
lawyer
frightened
face
then
the
visages
of
two
men
who
seemed
to
be
persons
of
some
authority
what
news
faltered
the
lawyer
seeing
by
our
faces
that
we
knew
the
worst
bad
i
returned
the
poison
had
lost
none
of
its
virulence
by
being
mixed
so
long
with
the
wine
how
many
asked
the
man
on
his
right
anxiously
eight
was
my
solemn
reply
there
were
but
eight
faltered
the
lawyer
that
means
then
all
all
i
repeated
a
murmur
of
horror
rose
swelled
then
died
out
in
tumult
as
the
crowd
swept
on
past
us
for
a
moment
we
stood
watching
these
people
saw
them
pause
before
the
door
we
had
left
open
behind
us
then
rush
in
leaving
a
wail
of
terror
on
the
shuddering
midnight
air
when
all
was
quiet
again
eunice
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
where
shall
we
go
she
asked
despairingly
i
do
not
know
a
house
that
will
open
to
me
the
answer
to
her
question
came
from
other
lips
than
mine
i
do
not
know
one
that
will
spoke
up
a
voice
behind
our
backs
your
withdrawal
from
the
circle
of
heirs
did
not
take
from
you
your
rightful
claim
to
an
inheritance
which
according
to
your
uncle
will
could
be
forfeited
only
by
a
failure
to
arrive
at
the
place
of
distribution
within
the
hour
set
by
the
testator
as
i
see
the
matter
now
this
appeal
to
the
honesty
of
the
persons
so
collected
was
a
test
by
which
my
unhappy
client
strove
to
save
from
the
general
fate
such
members
of
his
miserable
family
as
fully
recognized
their
sin
and
were
truly
repentant
it
was
lawyer
smead
he
had
lingered
behind
the
others
to
tell
her
this
she
was
then
no
outcast
but
rich
very
rich
how
rich
i
dared
not
acknowledge
to
myself
lest
a
remembrance
of
the
man
who
was
the
last
to
perish
in
that
house
of
death
should
return
to
make
this
calculation
hateful
it
was
a
blow
which
struck
deep
deeper
than
any
either
of
us
had
sustained
that
night
as
we
came
to
realize
it
i
stepped
slowly
back
leaving
her
standing
erect
and
tall
in
the
middle
of
the
roadway
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
but
not
for
long
soon
she
was
close
at
my
side
murmuring
softly
two
wayfarers
still
only
the
road
will
be
more
difficult
and
the
need
of
companionship
greater
shall
we
fare
on
together
you
i
and
the
little
one
the
ruby
and
the
caldron
as
there
were
two
good
men
on
duty
that
night
i
did
not
see
why
i
should
remain
at
my
desk
even
though
there
was
an
unusual
stir
created
in
our
small
town
by
the
grand
ball
given
at
the
evergreens
but
just
as
i
was
preparing
to
start
for
home
an
imperative
ring
called
me
to
the
telephone
and
i
heard
halloo
is
this
the
it
is
well
then
a
detective
is
wanted
at
once
at
the
evergreens
he
can
not
be
too
clever
or
too
discreet
a
valuable
jewel
has
been
lost
which
must
be
found
before
the
guests
disperse
for
home
large
reward
if
the
matter
ends
successfully
and
without
too
great
publicity
may
i
ask
who
is
speaking
to
me
mrs
ashley
it
was
the
mistress
of
the
evergreens
and
giver
of
the
ball
madam
a
man
shall
be
sent
at
once
where
will
you
see
him
in
the
butler
pantry
at
the
rear
let
him
give
his
name
as
jennings
very
good
a
pretty
piece
of
work
should
i
send
hendricks
or
should
i
send
hicks
hendricks
was
clever
and
hicks
discreet
but
neither
united
both
qualifications
in
the
measure
demanded
by
the
sensible
and
woman
with
whom
i
had
just
been
talking
what
alternative
remained
but
one
i
must
go
myself
it
was
not
late
not
for
a
ball
night
at
least
and
as
half
the
town
had
been
invited
to
the
dance
the
streets
were
alive
with
carriages
i
was
watching
the
blink
of
their
lights
through
the
fast
falling
snow
when
my
attention
was
drawn
to
a
fact
which
struck
me
as
peculiar
these
carriages
were
all
coming
my
way
instead
of
rolling
in
the
direction
of
the
evergreens
had
they
been
empty
this
would
have
needed
no
explanation
but
as
far
as
i
could
see
most
of
them
were
full
and
that
too
with
loudly
talking
women
and
gesticulating
men
something
of
a
serious
nature
must
have
occurred
at
the
evergreens
rapidly
i
paced
on
and
soon
found
myself
before
the
great
gates
a
crowd
of
vehicles
of
all
descriptions
blocked
the
entrance
none
seemed
to
be
passing
up
the
driveway
all
stood
clustered
at
the
gates
and
as
i
drew
nearer
i
perceived
many
an
anxious
head
thrust
forth
from
their
quickly
opened
doors
and
heard
many
an
ejaculation
of
disappointment
as
the
short
interchange
of
words
went
on
between
the
drivers
of
these
various
turnouts
and
a
man
drawn
up
in
quiet
resolution
before
the
unexpectedly
barred
entrance
slipping
round
to
this
man
side
i
listened
to
what
he
was
saying
it
was
simple
but
very
explicit
ashley
asks
everybody
pardon
but
the
ball
ca
go
on
something
has
happened
which
makes
the
reception
of
further
guests
impossible
evening
she
will
be
happy
to
see
you
all
the
dance
is
simply
postponed
this
he
had
probably
repeated
forty
times
and
each
time
it
had
probably
been
received
with
the
same
mixture
of
doubt
and
curiosity
which
now
held
the
lengthy
procession
in
check
not
wishing
to
attract
attention
yet
anxious
to
lose
no
time
i
pressed
up
still
nearer
and
bending
toward
him
from
the
shadow
cast
by
a
convenient
post
uttered
the
one
word
jennings
instantly
he
unlocked
a
small
gate
at
his
right
i
passed
in
and
with
professional
proceeded
to
take
my
way
to
the
house
through
the
double
row
of
evergreens
bordering
the
semicircular
approach
as
these
trees
stood
very
close
together
and
were
besides
heavily
laden
with
snow
i
failed
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
building
itself
until
i
stood
in
front
of
it
then
i
saw
that
it
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
gave
evidence
here
and
there
of
some
festivity
but
the
guests
were
too
few
for
the
effect
to
be
very
exhilarating
and
passing
around
to
the
rear
i
sought
the
special
entrance
to
which
i
had
been
directed
a
porch
before
which
stood
a
caterer
wagon
led
me
to
a
door
which
had
every
appearance
of
being
the
one
i
sought
pushing
it
open
i
entered
without
ceremony
and
speedily
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
twenty
or
more
colored
waiters
and
chattering
housemaids
to
one
of
the
former
i
addressed
the
question
where
is
the
butler
pantry
i
am
told
that
i
shall
find
the
lady
of
the
house
there
your
name
was
the
curt
demand
jennings
follow
me
i
was
taken
through
narrow
passages
and
across
one
or
two
to
a
small
but
closet
where
i
was
left
with
the
assurance
that
ashley
would
presently
join
me
i
had
never
seen
this
lady
but
i
had
often
heard
her
spoken
of
as
a
woman
of
superior
character
and
admirable
discretion
she
did
not
keep
me
waiting
in
two
minutes
the
door
opened
and
this
fine
woman
was
telling
her
story
in
the
straightforward
manner
i
so
much
admire
and
so
seldom
meet
with
the
article
lost
was
a
large
ruby
of
singular
beauty
and
great
value
the
property
of
burton
the
senator
wife
in
whose
honor
this
ball
was
given
it
had
not
been
lost
in
the
house
nor
had
it
been
originally
missed
that
evening
burton
and
herself
had
attended
the
great
game
in
the
afternoon
and
it
was
on
the
college
campus
that
burton
had
first
dropped
her
invaluable
jewel
but
a
reward
of
five
hundred
dollars
having
been
at
once
offered
to
whoever
should
find
and
restore
it
a
great
search
had
followed
which
ended
in
its
being
picked
up
by
one
of
the
students
and
brought
back
as
far
as
the
great
step
leading
up
to
the
front
door
when
it
had
again
disappeared
and
in
a
way
to
rouse
conjecture
of
the
strangest
and
most
puzzling
character
the
young
man
who
had
brought
it
thus
far
bore
the
name
of
john
deane
and
was
a
member
of
the
senior
class
he
had
been
the
first
to
detect
its
sparkle
in
the
grass
and
those
who
were
near
enough
to
see
his
face
at
that
happy
moment
say
that
it
expressed
the
utmost
satisfaction
at
his
good
luck
you
see
said
ashley
he
has
a
sweetheart
and
five
hundred
dollars
looks
like
a
fortune
to
a
young
man
just
starting
life
but
he
was
weak
enough
to
take
this
girl
into
his
confidence
and
on
their
way
here
for
both
were
invited
to
the
ball
he
went
so
far
as
to
pull
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
show
it
to
her
they
were
admiring
it
together
and
vaunting
its
beauties
to
the
young
lady
friend
who
had
accompanied
them
when
their
carriage
turned
into
the
driveway
and
they
saw
the
lights
of
the
house
flashing
before
them
hastily
restoring
the
jewel
to
the
little
bag
he
had
made
for
it
out
of
the
of
an
old
glove
a
bag
in
which
he
assured
me
he
had
been
careful
to
keep
it
safely
tied
ever
since
picking
it
up
on
the
college
green
he
thrust
it
back
into
his
pocket
and
prepared
to
help
the
ladies
out
but
just
then
a
disturbance
arose
in
front
a
horse
which
had
been
driven
up
was
rearing
in
a
way
that
threatened
to
overturn
the
light
buggy
to
which
he
was
attached
as
the
occupants
of
this
buggy
were
ladies
and
seemed
to
have
no
control
over
the
plunging
beast
young
deane
naturally
sprang
to
the
rescue
bidding
his
own
ladies
alight
and
make
for
the
porch
he
hurriedly
ran
forward
and
pausing
in
front
of
the
maddened
animal
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
seize
him
by
the
rein
he
says
that
as
he
stood
there
facing
the
beast
with
fixed
eye
and
raised
hand
he
distinctly
felt
something
strike
or
touch
his
breast
but
the
sensation
conveyed
no
meaning
to
him
in
his
excitement
and
he
did
not
think
of
it
again
till
the
horse
well
in
hand
and
the
two
alarmed
occupants
of
the
buggy
rescued
he
turned
to
see
where
his
own
ladies
were
and
beheld
them
looking
down
at
him
from
the
midst
of
a
circle
of
young
people
drawn
from
the
house
by
the
screaming
of
the
women
instantly
a
thought
of
the
treasure
he
carried
recurred
to
his
mind
and
dropping
the
rein
of
the
now
quieted
horse
he
put
his
hand
to
his
pocket
the
jewel
was
gone
he
declares
that
for
a
moment
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
struck
on
the
head
by
one
of
the
hoofs
of
the
frantic
horse
he
had
just
handled
but
immediately
the
importance
of
his
loss
and
the
necessity
he
felt
for
instant
action
restored
him
to
himself
and
shouting
aloud
have
dropped
burton
ruby
begged
every
one
to
stand
still
while
he
made
a
search
for
it
this
all
occurred
as
you
must
know
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
consequently
before
many
of
my
guests
had
arrived
my
son
who
was
one
of
the
few
spectators
gathered
on
the
porch
tells
me
that
there
was
only
one
other
carriage
behind
the
one
in
which
deane
had
brought
his
ladies
both
of
these
had
stopped
short
of
the
and
as
the
horse
and
buggy
which
had
made
all
this
trouble
had
by
this
time
been
driven
to
the
stable
nothing
stood
in
the
way
of
his
search
but
the
rapidly
accumulating
snow
which
if
you
remember
was
falling
very
thick
and
fast
at
the
time
my
son
who
had
rushed
in
for
his
overcoat
came
running
down
with
offers
to
help
him
so
did
some
others
but
with
an
imploring
gesture
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
conduct
the
search
alone
the
ground
being
in
such
a
state
that
the
jewel
ran
great
risk
of
being
trodden
into
the
snow
and
thus
injured
or
lost
they
humored
him
for
a
moment
then
seeing
that
his
efforts
bade
fair
to
be
fruitless
my
son
insisted
upon
joining
him
and
the
two
looked
the
ground
over
inch
by
inch
from
the
place
where
deane
had
set
foot
to
ground
in
alighting
from
his
carriage
to
the
exact
spot
where
he
had
stood
when
he
had
finally
seized
hold
of
the
horse
but
no
ruby
then
harrison
that
is
my
son
name
sent
for
a
broom
and
went
over
the
place
again
sweeping
aside
the
surface
snow
and
examining
carefully
the
ground
beneath
but
with
no
better
results
than
before
no
ruby
could
be
found
my
son
came
to
me
panting
burton
and
myself
stood
awaiting
him
in
a
state
of
suspense
guests
and
fête
were
alike
forgotten
we
had
heard
that
the
jewel
had
been
found
on
the
campus
by
one
of
the
students
and
had
been
brought
back
as
far
as
the
step
in
front
and
then
lost
again
in
some
unaccountable
manner
in
the
snow
and
we
hoped
nay
expected
from
moment
to
moment
that
it
would
be
brought
in
when
harrison
entered
then
pale
disheveled
and
shaking
his
head
burton
caught
me
by
the
hand
and
i
thought
she
would
faint
for
this
jewel
is
of
far
greater
value
to
her
than
its
mere
worth
in
money
though
that
is
by
no
means
small
it
is
a
family
jewel
and
was
given
to
her
by
her
husband
under
special
circumstances
he
prizes
it
even
more
than
she
does
and
he
is
not
here
to
counsel
or
assist
her
in
this
extremity
besides
she
was
wearing
it
in
direct
opposition
to
his
expressed
wishes
this
i
must
tell
you
to
show
how
imperative
it
is
for
us
to
recover
it
also
to
account
for
the
large
reward
she
is
willing
to
pay
when
he
last
looked
at
it
he
noticed
that
the
fastening
was
a
trifle
slack
and
though
he
handed
the
trinket
back
he
told
her
distinctly
that
she
was
not
to
wear
it
till
it
had
been
either
to
tiffany
or
starr
but
she
considered
it
safe
enough
and
put
it
on
to
please
the
boys
and
lost
it
senator
burton
is
a
hard
man
and
in
short
the
jewel
must
be
found
i
give
you
just
one
hour
in
which
to
do
it
but
madam
i
protested
i
know
she
put
in
with
a
quick
nod
and
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
to
see
if
the
door
was
shut
i
have
not
finished
my
story
hearing
what
harrison
had
to
say
i
took
action
at
once
i
bade
him
call
in
the
guests
whom
curiosity
or
interest
still
detained
on
the
porch
and
seat
them
in
a
certain
room
which
i
designated
to
him
then
after
telling
him
to
send
two
men
to
the
gates
with
orders
to
hold
back
all
further
carriages
from
entering
and
two
others
to
shovel
up
and
cart
away
to
the
stable
every
particle
of
snow
for
ten
feet
each
side
of
the
front
step
i
asked
to
see
deane
but
here
my
son
whispered
something
into
my
ear
which
it
is
my
duty
to
repeat
it
was
to
the
effect
that
deane
believed
that
the
jewel
had
been
taken
from
him
that
he
insisted
in
fact
that
he
had
felt
a
hand
touch
his
breast
while
he
stood
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
seize
the
horse
good
said
i
remember
that
too
but
first
see
that
my
orders
are
carried
out
and
that
all
approaches
to
the
grounds
are
guarded
and
no
one
allowed
to
come
in
or
go
out
without
permission
from
me
he
left
us
and
i
was
turning
to
encourage
burton
when
my
attention
was
caught
by
the
eager
face
of
a
little
friend
of
mine
who
quite
unknown
to
me
was
sitting
in
one
of
the
corners
of
the
room
she
was
studying
my
countenance
in
a
sort
of
subdued
anxiety
hardly
natural
in
one
so
young
and
i
was
about
to
call
her
to
my
side
and
question
her
when
she
made
a
sudden
dive
and
vanished
from
the
room
some
impulse
made
me
follow
her
she
is
a
conscientious
little
thing
but
timid
as
a
hare
and
though
i
saw
she
had
something
to
say
it
was
with
difficulty
i
could
make
her
speak
only
after
the
most
solemn
assurances
that
her
name
should
not
be
mentioned
in
the
matter
would
she
give
me
the
following
bit
of
information
which
you
may
possibly
think
throws
another
light
upon
the
affair
it
seems
that
she
was
looking
out
of
one
of
the
front
windows
when
deane
carriage
drove
up
she
had
been
watching
the
antics
of
the
horse
attached
to
the
buggy
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
deane
going
to
the
assistance
of
those
in
danger
she
let
her
eyes
stray
back
to
the
ladies
whom
he
had
left
behind
him
in
the
carriage
she
did
not
know
these
ladies
but
their
looks
and
gestures
interested
her
and
she
watched
them
quite
intently
as
they
leaped
to
the
ground
and
made
their
way
toward
the
porch
one
went
on
quickly
and
without
pause
to
the
step
but
the
other
the
one
who
came
last
did
not
do
this
she
stopped
a
moment
perhaps
to
watch
the
horse
in
front
perhaps
to
draw
her
cloak
more
closely
about
her
and
when
she
again
moved
on
it
was
with
a
start
and
a
hurried
glance
at
her
feet
terminating
in
a
quick
turn
and
a
sudden
stooping
to
the
ground
when
she
again
stood
upright
she
had
something
in
her
hand
which
she
thrust
furtively
into
her
breast
how
was
this
lady
dressed
i
inquired
in
a
white
cloak
with
an
edging
of
fur
i
took
pains
to
learn
that
too
and
it
was
with
some
curiosity
i
assure
you
that
i
examined
the
few
guests
who
had
now
been
admitted
to
the
room
i
had
so
carefully
pointed
out
to
my
son
two
of
them
wore
white
cloaks
but
one
of
these
was
dalrymple
and
i
did
not
give
her
or
her
cloak
a
second
thought
the
other
was
a
tall
girl
with
an
air
and
bearing
calculated
to
rouse
admiration
if
she
had
not
shown
so
very
plainly
that
she
was
in
a
state
of
inner
perturbation
though
she
tried
to
look
amiable
and
pleased
i
saw
that
she
had
some
care
on
her
mind
which
had
she
been
deane
would
have
needed
no
explanation
but
as
she
was
only
deane
friend
its
cause
was
not
so
apparent
the
floor
of
the
room
as
i
had
happily
remembered
was
covered
with
crash
and
as
i
lifted
each
garment
off
i
allowed
no
maid
to
assist
me
in
this
i
shook
it
well
ostensibly
because
of
the
few
flakes
clinging
to
it
really
to
see
if
anything
could
be
shaken
out
of
it
of
course
i
met
with
no
success
i
had
not
expected
to
but
it
is
my
disposition
to
be
thorough
these
wraps
i
saw
all
hung
in
an
adjoining
closet
the
door
of
which
i
locked
here
is
the
key
after
which
i
handed
my
guests
over
to
my
son
who
led
them
into
the
where
they
joined
the
few
others
who
had
previously
arrived
and
went
myself
to
telephone
to
i
bowed
and
asked
where
the
young
people
were
now
still
in
the
i
have
ordered
the
musicians
to
play
and
consequently
there
is
more
or
less
dancing
but
of
course
nothing
can
remove
the
wet
blanket
which
has
fallen
over
us
all
nothing
but
the
finding
of
this
jewel
do
you
see
your
way
to
accomplishing
this
we
are
from
this
very
moment
at
your
disposal
only
i
pray
that
you
will
make
no
more
disturbance
than
is
necessary
and
if
possible
arouse
no
suspicions
you
can
not
back
up
by
facts
i
dread
a
scandal
almost
as
much
as
i
do
sickness
and
death
and
these
young
people
well
their
lives
are
all
before
them
and
neither
burton
nor
myself
would
wish
to
throw
the
shadow
of
a
false
suspicion
over
the
least
of
them
i
assured
her
that
i
sympathized
with
her
scruples
and
would
do
my
best
to
recover
the
ruby
without
inflicting
undue
annoyance
upon
the
innocent
then
i
inquired
whether
it
was
known
that
a
detective
had
been
called
in
she
seemed
to
think
it
was
suspected
by
some
if
not
by
all
at
which
my
way
seemed
a
trifle
complicated
we
were
about
to
proceed
when
another
thought
struck
me
madam
you
have
not
said
whether
the
carriage
itself
was
searched
i
forgot
yes
the
carriage
was
thoroughly
overhauled
and
before
the
coachman
left
the
box
who
did
this
overhauling
my
son
he
would
not
trust
any
other
hand
than
his
own
in
a
business
of
this
kind
one
more
question
madam
was
any
one
seen
to
approach
deane
on
the
prior
to
his
assertion
that
the
jewel
was
lost
no
there
were
no
tracks
in
the
snow
of
any
such
my
son
looked
and
i
would
look
or
so
i
decided
within
myself
but
i
said
nothing
and
in
silence
we
proceeded
toward
the
i
had
left
my
overcoat
behind
me
and
always
being
i
did
not
present
so
bad
an
appearance
still
i
was
not
in
party
attire
and
naturally
could
not
pass
for
a
guest
if
i
had
wanted
to
which
i
did
not
i
felt
that
i
must
rely
on
insight
in
this
case
and
on
a
certain
power
i
had
always
possessed
of
reading
faces
that
the
case
called
for
just
this
species
of
intuition
i
was
positive
burton
ruby
was
within
a
hundred
yards
of
us
at
this
very
moment
probably
within
a
hundred
feet
but
to
lay
hands
on
it
and
without
scandal
well
that
was
a
problem
calculated
to
rouse
the
interest
of
even
an
old
like
myself
a
strain
of
music
desultory
however
and
spiritless
like
everything
else
about
the
place
that
night
greeted
us
as
ashley
opened
the
door
leading
directly
into
the
large
front
hall
immediately
a
scene
meant
to
be
festive
but
which
was
in
fact
desolate
burst
upon
us
the
lights
the
flowers
and
the
brilliant
appearance
of
such
ladies
as
flitted
into
sight
from
the
almost
empty
parlors
were
all
suggestive
of
the
cheer
suitable
to
a
great
occasion
but
in
spite
of
this
the
effect
was
altogether
melancholy
for
the
hundreds
who
should
have
graced
this
scene
and
for
whom
this
illumination
had
been
made
and
these
festoons
hung
had
been
turned
away
from
the
gates
and
the
few
who
felt
they
must
remain
because
their
hostess
showed
no
disposition
to
let
them
go
wore
any
but
holiday
faces
for
all
their
forced
smiles
and
pitiful
attempts
at
nonchalance
and
gaiety
i
scrutinized
these
faces
carefully
i
detected
nothing
in
them
but
annoyance
at
a
situation
which
certainly
was
anything
but
pleasant
turning
to
ashley
i
requested
her
to
be
kind
enough
to
point
out
her
son
adding
that
i
should
be
glad
to
have
a
moment
conversation
with
him
also
with
deane
deane
is
in
one
of
those
small
rooms
over
there
he
is
quite
upset
not
even
burton
can
comfort
him
my
son
oh
there
is
harrison
a
tall
young
man
was
crossing
the
hall
ashley
called
him
to
her
and
in
another
moment
we
were
standing
together
in
one
of
the
empty
parlors
i
gave
him
my
name
and
told
him
my
business
then
i
said
your
mother
has
allotted
me
an
hour
in
which
to
find
the
valuable
jewel
which
has
just
been
lost
on
these
premises
here
i
smiled
she
evidently
has
great
confidence
in
my
ability
i
must
see
that
i
do
not
disappoint
her
all
this
time
i
was
examining
his
face
it
was
a
handsome
one
as
i
have
said
but
it
had
also
a
very
candid
expression
the
eyes
looked
straight
into
mine
and
while
showing
anxiety
betrayed
no
deeper
emotion
than
the
occasion
naturally
called
for
have
you
any
suggestions
to
offer
i
understand
that
you
were
on
the
ground
almost
as
soon
as
deane
discovered
his
loss
his
eyes
changed
a
trifle
but
did
not
swerve
of
course
he
had
been
informed
by
his
mother
of
the
suspicious
action
of
the
young
lady
who
had
been
a
member
of
that
gentleman
party
and
shrank
as
any
one
in
his
position
would
from
the
responsibilities
entailed
by
this
knowledge
no
said
he
we
have
done
all
we
can
the
next
move
must
come
from
you
there
is
one
that
will
settle
the
matter
in
a
moment
i
assured
him
still
with
my
eyes
fixed
scrutinizingly
on
his
face
a
universal
search
not
of
places
but
of
persons
but
it
is
a
harsh
measure
a
most
disagreeable
one
he
emphasized
flushing
such
an
indignity
offered
to
guests
would
never
be
forgotten
or
forgiven
true
but
if
they
offered
to
submit
to
this
themselves
they
how
if
the
son
of
the
house
their
host
we
may
say
should
call
them
together
and
for
your
own
satisfaction
empty
out
your
pockets
in
the
sight
of
every
one
do
you
think
that
all
the
men
and
possibly
all
the
women
too
here
i
let
my
voice
fall
suggestively
would
be
glad
to
follow
suit
it
could
be
done
in
apparent
joke
he
shook
his
head
with
a
straightforward
air
which
raised
him
high
in
my
estimation
that
would
call
for
little
but
effrontery
on
my
part
said
he
but
think
what
it
would
demand
from
these
boys
who
came
here
for
the
sole
purpose
of
enjoying
themselves
i
will
not
so
much
as
mention
the
ladies
yet
one
of
the
latter
i
know
he
quietly
acknowledged
growing
restless
for
the
first
time
i
withdrew
my
eyes
from
his
face
i
had
learned
what
i
wished
personally
he
did
not
shrink
from
search
therefore
the
jewel
was
not
in
his
pockets
this
left
but
two
persons
for
suspicion
to
halt
between
but
i
disclosed
nothing
of
my
thoughts
i
merely
asked
pardon
for
a
suggestion
that
while
pardonable
in
a
man
accustomed
to
handle
crime
with
ungloved
hands
could
not
fail
to
prove
offensive
to
a
gentleman
like
himself
we
must
move
by
means
less
open
i
concluded
it
adds
to
our
difficulties
but
that
can
not
be
helped
i
should
now
like
a
glimpse
of
mr
deane
do
you
not
wish
to
speak
to
him
i
should
prefer
a
sight
of
his
face
first
he
led
me
across
the
hall
and
pointed
through
an
open
door
in
the
center
of
a
small
room
containing
a
table
and
some
chairs
i
perceived
a
young
man
sitting
with
fallen
head
and
dejected
air
staring
at
vacancy
by
his
side
with
hand
laid
on
his
knelt
a
young
girl
striving
in
this
gentle
but
speechless
way
to
comfort
him
it
made
a
pathetic
picture
i
drew
ashley
away
i
am
disposed
to
believe
in
that
young
man
said
i
if
he
still
has
the
jewel
he
would
not
try
to
carry
off
the
situation
in
just
this
way
he
really
looks
oh
he
is
dreadfully
cut
up
if
you
could
have
seen
how
frantically
he
searched
for
the
stone
and
the
depression
into
which
he
fell
when
he
realized
that
it
was
not
to
be
found
you
would
not
doubt
him
for
an
instant
what
made
you
think
he
might
still
have
the
ruby
oh
we
police
officers
think
of
everything
then
the
fact
that
he
insists
that
something
or
some
one
touched
his
breast
on
the
driveway
strikes
me
as
a
trifle
suspicious
your
mother
says
that
no
second
person
could
have
been
there
or
the
snow
would
have
given
evidence
of
it
yes
i
looked
expressly
of
course
the
drive
itself
was
full
of
and
for
several
carriages
had
already
passed
over
it
then
there
were
all
of
deane
footsteps
but
no
other
man
as
far
as
i
could
see
yet
he
insists
that
he
was
touched
or
struck
yes
with
no
one
there
to
touch
or
strike
him
ashley
was
silent
let
us
step
out
and
take
a
view
of
the
place
i
suggested
i
should
prefer
doing
this
to
questioning
the
young
man
in
his
present
state
of
mind
then
as
we
turned
to
put
on
our
coats
i
asked
with
suitable
precaution
do
you
suppose
that
he
has
the
same
secret
suspicions
as
ourselves
and
that
it
is
to
hide
these
he
insists
upon
the
having
been
taken
away
from
him
at
a
point
the
ladies
are
known
not
to
have
approached
young
ashley
bent
somewhat
startled
eyes
on
mine
nothing
has
been
said
to
him
of
what
miss
peters
saw
miss
glover
do
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
mention
it
i
have
not
even
allowed
myself
to
believe
here
a
fierce
gust
blowing
in
from
the
door
he
had
just
opened
cut
short
his
words
and
neither
of
us
spoke
again
till
we
stood
on
the
exact
spot
in
the
driveway
where
the
episode
we
were
endeavoring
to
understand
had
taken
place
oh
i
cried
as
soon
as
i
could
look
about
me
the
mystery
is
explained
look
at
that
bush
or
perhaps
you
call
it
a
shrub
if
the
wind
were
blowing
as
freshly
as
it
is
now
and
very
probably
it
was
one
of
those
slender
branches
might
easily
be
switched
against
his
breast
especially
if
he
stood
as
you
say
he
did
close
against
this
border
well
i
a
fool
only
the
other
day
i
told
the
gardener
that
these
branches
would
need
trimming
in
the
spring
and
yet
i
never
so
much
as
thought
of
them
when
deane
spoke
of
something
striking
his
breast
as
we
turned
back
i
made
this
remark
with
this
explanation
of
the
one
doubtful
point
in
his
otherwise
plausible
account
we
can
credit
his
story
as
being
in
the
main
true
which
i
calmly
added
places
him
above
suspicion
and
narrows
our
inquiry
down
to
we
had
moved
quickly
and
were
now
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
by
which
we
had
come
out
ashley
i
continued
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
add
to
your
former
favors
that
of
showing
me
the
young
lady
in
whom
from
this
moment
on
we
are
especially
interested
if
you
can
manage
to
let
me
see
her
first
without
her
seeing
me
i
shall
be
infinitely
obliged
to
you
i
do
not
know
where
she
is
i
shall
have
to
search
for
her
i
will
wait
by
the
hall
door
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
to
me
come
said
he
and
led
me
into
what
i
judged
to
be
the
library
with
a
gesture
toward
one
of
the
windows
he
backed
quickly
out
leaving
me
to
face
the
situation
alone
i
was
rather
glad
of
this
glancing
in
the
direction
he
had
indicated
and
perceiving
the
figure
of
a
young
lady
standing
with
her
back
to
me
on
the
farther
side
of
a
flowing
lace
curtain
i
took
a
few
steps
toward
her
hoping
that
the
movement
would
cause
her
to
turn
but
it
entirely
failed
to
produce
this
effect
nor
did
she
give
any
sign
that
she
noted
the
intrusion
this
prevented
me
from
catching
the
glimpse
of
her
face
which
i
so
desired
and
obliged
me
to
confine
myself
to
a
study
of
her
dress
and
attitude
the
former
was
very
elegant
more
elegant
than
the
appearance
of
her
two
friends
had
led
me
to
expect
though
i
am
far
from
being
an
authority
on
feminine
toilets
i
yet
had
experience
enough
to
know
that
those
sweeping
folds
of
spotless
satin
with
their
festoons
of
lace
and
loops
of
shiny
trimming
which
it
would
be
folly
for
me
to
attempt
to
describe
represented
not
only
the
best
efforts
of
the
dressmaker
art
but
very
considerable
means
on
the
part
of
the
woman
wearing
such
a
gown
this
was
a
discovery
which
altered
the
complexion
of
my
thoughts
for
a
moment
for
i
had
presupposed
her
a
girl
of
humble
means
willing
to
sacrifice
certain
scruples
to
obtain
a
little
extra
money
this
imposing
figure
might
be
that
of
a
millionaire
daughter
how
then
could
i
associate
her
even
in
my
own
mind
with
theft
i
decided
that
i
must
see
her
face
before
giving
answer
to
these
doubts
she
did
not
seem
inclined
to
turn
she
had
raised
the
shade
from
before
the
wintry
panes
and
was
engaged
in
looking
out
her
attitude
was
not
that
of
one
simply
enjoying
a
moment
respite
from
the
dance
it
was
rather
that
of
an
absorbed
mind
brooding
upon
what
gave
little
or
no
pleasure
and
as
i
further
gazed
and
noted
the
droop
of
her
lovely
shoulders
and
the
languor
visible
in
her
whole
bearing
i
began
to
regard
a
glimpse
of
her
features
as
imperative
moving
forward
i
came
upon
her
suddenly
excuse
me
miss
smith
i
boldly
exclaimed
then
paused
for
she
had
turned
instinctively
and
i
had
seen
that
for
which
i
had
risked
this
daring
move
your
pardon
i
hastily
apologized
i
mistook
you
for
another
young
lady
and
drew
back
with
a
low
bow
to
let
her
pass
for
i
saw
that
she
thought
only
of
escaping
both
me
and
the
room
and
i
did
not
wonder
at
this
for
her
eyes
were
streaming
with
tears
and
her
face
which
was
doubtless
a
pretty
one
under
ordinary
conditions
looked
so
distorted
with
distracting
emotions
that
she
was
no
fit
subject
for
any
man
eye
let
alone
that
of
a
officer
of
the
law
on
the
for
the
guilty
hand
which
had
just
appropriated
a
jewel
worth
anywhere
from
eight
to
ten
thousand
dollars
yet
i
was
glad
to
see
her
weep
for
only
first
offenders
weep
and
first
offenders
are
amenable
to
influence
especially
if
they
have
been
led
into
wrong
by
impulse
and
are
weak
rather
than
wicked
anxious
to
make
no
blunder
i
resolved
before
proceeding
further
to
learn
what
i
could
of
the
character
and
antecedents
of
the
suspected
one
and
this
from
the
only
source
which
offered
deane
affianced
this
young
lady
was
a
delicate
girl
with
a
face
like
a
flower
recognizing
her
sensitive
nature
i
approached
her
with
the
utmost
gentleness
not
seeking
to
disguise
either
the
nature
of
my
business
or
my
reasons
for
being
in
the
house
since
all
this
gave
me
authority
i
modulated
my
tone
to
suit
her
gentle
spirit
and
above
all
i
showed
the
utmost
sympathy
for
her
lover
whose
rights
in
the
reward
had
been
taken
from
him
as
certainly
as
the
jewel
had
been
taken
from
burton
in
this
way
i
gained
her
confidence
and
she
was
quite
ready
to
listen
when
i
observed
there
is
a
young
lady
here
who
seems
to
be
in
a
state
of
even
greater
trouble
than
deane
why
is
this
you
brought
her
here
is
her
sympathy
with
deane
so
great
as
to
cause
her
to
weep
over
his
loss
frances
oh
no
she
likes
deane
and
she
likes
me
but
not
well
enough
to
cry
over
our
misfortunes
i
think
she
has
some
trouble
of
her
own
one
that
you
can
tell
me
her
surprise
was
manifest
why
do
you
ask
that
what
interest
have
you
called
in
as
i
understand
to
recover
a
stolen
jewel
in
frances
glover
personal
difficulties
i
saw
that
i
must
make
my
position
perfectly
plain
only
this
she
was
seen
to
pick
up
something
from
the
driveway
where
no
one
else
had
succeeded
in
finding
anything
she
when
who
saw
her
i
can
not
answer
all
these
questions
at
once
i
smiled
she
was
seen
to
do
this
no
matter
by
whom
during
your
passage
from
the
carriage
to
the
stoop
as
you
preceded
her
you
naturally
did
not
observe
this
action
which
was
fortunate
perhaps
as
you
would
scarcely
have
known
what
to
do
or
say
about
it
yes
i
should
she
retorted
with
a
most
unexpected
display
of
spirit
i
should
have
asked
her
what
she
had
found
and
i
should
have
insisted
upon
an
answer
i
love
my
friends
but
i
love
the
man
i
am
to
marry
better
here
her
voice
fell
and
a
most
becoming
blush
suffused
her
cheek
quite
right
i
assented
now
will
you
answer
my
former
question
what
troubles
miss
glover
can
you
tell
me
that
i
can
not
i
only
know
that
she
has
been
very
silent
ever
since
she
left
the
house
i
thought
her
beautiful
new
dress
would
please
her
but
it
does
not
seem
to
she
has
been
unhappy
and
preoccupied
all
the
evening
she
only
roused
a
bit
when
deane
showed
us
the
ruby
and
said
oh
i
forgot
what
that
what
have
you
forgot
what
you
said
just
now
i
would
add
a
word
pardon
me
i
smilingly
interrupted
looking
as
fatherly
as
i
could
but
you
added
this
word
and
now
you
must
tell
me
what
it
means
you
were
going
to
say
she
showed
interest
in
the
extraordinary
jewel
which
deane
took
from
his
pocket
and
in
what
he
let
fall
about
the
expected
reward
that
is
she
looked
eagerly
at
the
ruby
and
sighed
when
he
acknowledged
that
he
expected
it
to
bring
him
five
hundred
dollars
before
midnight
but
any
girl
of
no
more
means
than
she
might
do
that
it
would
not
be
fair
to
lay
too
much
stress
on
a
sigh
is
not
miss
glover
wealthy
she
wears
a
very
expensive
dress
i
observe
i
know
it
and
i
have
wondered
a
little
at
it
for
her
father
is
not
called
very
well
off
but
perhaps
she
bought
it
with
her
own
money
i
know
she
has
some
she
is
an
artist
in
burnt
wood
i
let
the
subject
of
miss
glover
dress
drop
i
had
heard
enough
to
satisfy
me
that
my
first
theory
was
correct
this
young
woman
beautifully
dressed
and
with
a
face
from
which
the
rounded
lines
of
early
girlhood
had
not
yet
departed
held
in
her
possession
probably
at
this
very
moment
burton
magnificent
jewel
but
where
on
her
person
or
hidden
in
some
of
her
belongings
i
remembered
the
cloak
in
the
closet
and
thought
it
wise
to
assure
myself
that
the
jewel
was
not
secreted
in
this
garment
before
i
proceeded
to
extreme
measures
ashley
upon
being
consulted
agreed
with
me
as
to
the
desirability
of
this
and
presently
i
had
this
poor
girl
cloak
in
my
hands
did
i
find
the
ruby
no
but
i
found
something
else
tucked
away
in
an
inner
pocket
which
struck
me
as
bearing
quite
pointedly
upon
this
case
it
was
the
bill
crumpled
soiled
and
of
the
dress
whose
elegance
had
so
surprised
her
friends
and
made
me
for
a
short
time
regard
her
as
the
daughter
of
wealthy
parents
an
enormous
bill
which
must
have
struck
dismay
to
the
soul
of
this
girl
who
probably
had
no
idea
of
how
a
french
dressmaker
can
foot
up
items
four
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
and
for
one
gown
i
declare
i
felt
indignant
myself
and
could
quite
understand
why
she
heaved
that
little
sigh
when
deane
spoke
of
the
five
hundred
dollars
he
expected
from
burton
and
later
how
she
came
to
succumb
to
the
temptation
of
making
the
effort
to
secure
this
sum
for
herself
when
in
following
the
latter
footsteps
up
the
driveway
she
stumbled
upon
this
same
jewel
fallen
as
it
were
from
his
pocket
into
her
very
hands
the
impulse
of
the
moment
was
so
strong
and
the
consequences
so
little
anticipated
it
is
not
at
all
probable
that
she
foresaw
he
would
shout
aloud
his
loss
and
draw
the
whole
household
out
on
the
porch
of
course
when
he
did
this
the
feasibility
of
her
project
was
gone
and
i
only
wished
that
i
had
been
present
and
able
to
note
her
countenance
as
crowded
in
with
others
on
that
windy
porch
she
watched
the
progress
of
the
search
which
every
moment
made
it
not
only
less
impossible
for
her
to
attempt
the
restoration
upon
which
the
reward
depended
but
must
have
caused
her
to
feel
if
she
had
been
as
well
brought
up
as
all
indications
showed
that
it
was
a
dishonest
act
of
which
she
had
been
guilty
and
that
willing
or
not
she
must
look
upon
herself
as
a
thief
so
long
as
she
held
the
jewel
back
from
deane
or
its
rightful
owner
but
how
face
the
publicity
of
restoring
it
now
after
this
elaborate
and
painful
search
in
which
even
the
son
of
her
hostess
had
taken
part
that
would
be
to
proclaim
her
guilt
and
thus
effectually
ruin
her
in
the
eyes
of
everybody
concerned
no
she
would
keep
the
compromising
article
a
little
longer
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
opportunity
of
returning
it
without
risk
to
her
good
name
and
so
she
allowed
the
search
to
proceed
i
have
entered
thus
elaborately
into
the
supposed
condition
of
this
girl
mind
on
this
critical
evening
that
you
may
understand
why
i
felt
a
certain
sympathy
for
her
which
forbade
harsh
measures
i
was
sure
from
the
glimpse
i
had
caught
of
her
face
that
she
longed
to
be
relieved
from
the
tension
she
was
under
and
that
she
would
gladly
rid
herself
of
this
valuable
jewel
if
she
only
knew
how
this
opportunity
i
proposed
to
give
her
and
this
is
why
on
returning
the
bill
to
its
place
i
assumed
such
an
air
of
relief
on
rejoining
ashley
she
saw
and
drew
me
aside
you
have
not
found
it
she
said
no
i
returned
but
i
am
positive
where
it
is
and
where
is
that
over
miss
glover
uneasy
heart
ashley
turned
pale
wait
said
i
i
have
a
scheme
for
getting
it
hence
without
making
her
shame
public
listen
and
i
whispered
a
few
words
in
her
ear
she
surveyed
me
in
amazement
for
a
moment
then
nodded
and
her
face
lighted
up
you
are
certainly
earning
your
reward
she
declared
and
summoning
her
son
who
was
never
far
away
from
her
side
she
whispered
her
wishes
he
started
bowed
and
hurried
from
the
room
by
this
time
my
business
in
the
house
was
to
all
and
i
could
not
appear
in
hall
or
parlor
without
a
great
silence
falling
upon
every
one
present
followed
by
a
breaking
up
of
the
only
too
small
circle
of
unhappy
guests
into
agitated
groups
but
i
appeared
to
see
nothing
of
all
this
till
the
proper
moment
when
turning
suddenly
upon
them
all
i
cried
out
cheerfully
but
with
a
certain
deference
i
thought
would
please
them
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
have
an
interesting
fact
to
announce
the
snow
which
was
taken
up
from
the
driveway
has
been
put
to
melt
in
the
great
feed
caldron
over
the
stable
fire
we
expect
to
find
the
ruby
at
the
bottom
and
ashley
invites
you
to
be
present
at
its
recovery
it
has
now
stopped
snowing
and
she
thought
you
might
enjoy
the
excitement
of
watching
the
water
ladled
out
a
dozen
girls
bounded
forward
oh
yes
what
fun
where
are
our
cloaks
our
rubbers
two
only
stood
hesitating
one
of
these
was
deane
lady
love
and
the
other
her
friend
miss
glover
the
former
perhaps
secretly
wondered
the
latter
but
i
dared
not
look
long
enough
or
closely
enough
in
her
direction
to
judge
just
what
her
emotions
were
presently
these
too
stepped
forward
into
the
excited
circle
of
young
people
and
were
met
by
the
two
maids
who
were
bringing
in
their
wraps
amid
the
bustle
which
now
ensued
i
caught
sight
of
deane
face
peering
from
an
open
doorway
it
was
all
alive
with
hope
i
also
perceived
a
lady
looking
down
from
the
second
story
who
i
felt
sure
was
burton
herself
evidently
my
confident
tone
had
produced
more
effect
than
the
words
themselves
every
one
looked
upon
the
jewel
as
already
recovered
and
regarded
my
invitation
to
the
stable
as
a
ruse
by
which
i
hoped
to
restore
universal
good
feeling
by
giving
them
all
a
share
in
my
triumph
all
but
one
nothing
could
make
miss
glover
look
otherwise
than
anxious
restless
and
unsettled
and
though
she
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
rest
it
was
with
hidden
face
and
lagging
step
as
if
she
recognized
the
whole
thing
as
a
farce
and
doubted
her
own
power
to
go
through
it
calmly
ah
ha
my
lady
thought
i
only
be
patient
and
you
will
see
what
i
shall
do
for
you
and
indeed
i
thought
her
eye
brightened
as
we
all
drew
up
around
the
huge
caldron
standing
full
of
water
over
the
stable
stove
as
pains
had
already
been
taken
to
put
out
the
fire
in
this
stove
the
ladies
were
not
afraid
of
injuring
their
dresses
and
consequently
crowded
as
close
as
their
numbers
would
permit
miss
glover
especially
stood
within
reach
of
the
brim
and
as
soon
as
i
noted
this
i
gave
the
signal
which
had
been
agreed
upon
between
ashley
and
myself
instantly
the
electric
lights
went
out
leaving
the
place
in
total
darkness
a
scream
from
the
girls
a
burst
of
hilarious
laughter
from
their
escorts
mingled
with
loud
apologies
from
their
seemingly
mischievous
host
filled
up
the
interval
of
darkness
which
i
had
insisted
should
not
be
too
soon
curtailed
then
the
lights
glowed
as
suddenly
as
they
had
gone
out
and
while
the
glare
was
fresh
on
every
face
i
stole
a
glance
at
miss
glover
to
see
if
she
had
made
good
use
of
the
opportunity
just
accorded
for
ridding
herself
of
the
jewel
by
dropping
it
into
the
caldron
if
she
had
both
her
troubles
and
mine
were
at
an
end
if
she
had
not
then
i
need
feel
no
further
scruple
in
approaching
her
with
the
direct
question
i
had
hitherto
found
it
so
difficult
to
put
she
stood
with
both
hands
grasping
her
cloak
which
she
had
drawn
tightly
about
the
rich
folds
of
her
new
and
expensive
dress
but
her
eyes
were
fixed
straight
before
her
with
a
soft
light
in
their
depths
which
made
her
positively
beautiful
the
jewel
is
in
the
pot
i
inwardly
decided
and
ordered
the
two
waiting
stablemen
to
step
forward
with
their
ladles
quickly
those
ladles
went
in
but
before
they
could
be
lifted
out
dripping
half
the
ladies
had
scurried
back
afraid
of
injury
to
their
pretty
dresses
but
they
soon
sidled
forward
again
and
watched
with
beaming
eyes
the
slow
but
sure
emptying
of
the
great
caldron
at
whose
bottom
they
anticipated
finding
the
lost
jewel
as
the
ladles
were
plunged
deeper
and
deeper
the
heads
drew
closer
and
so
great
was
the
interest
shown
that
the
busiest
lips
forgot
to
chatter
and
eyes
whose
only
business
up
till
now
had
been
to
follow
with
shy
curiosity
every
motion
made
by
their
handsome
young
host
now
settled
on
the
murky
depths
of
the
great
pot
whose
bottom
was
almost
in
sight
as
i
heard
the
ladles
strike
this
bottom
i
instinctively
withdrew
a
step
in
anticipation
of
the
loud
hurrah
which
would
naturally
hail
the
first
sight
of
the
lost
ruby
conceive
then
my
chagrin
my
bitter
and
mortified
disappointment
when
after
one
look
at
the
broad
surface
of
the
now
exposed
bottom
the
one
shout
which
rose
was
i
was
so
thoroughly
put
out
that
i
did
not
wait
to
hear
the
loud
complaints
which
burst
from
every
lip
drawing
ashley
aside
who
by
the
way
seemed
as
much
affected
as
myself
by
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
i
remarked
to
him
that
there
was
only
one
course
left
open
to
us
and
what
is
that
to
ask
miss
glover
to
show
me
what
she
picked
up
from
your
driveway
and
if
she
refuses
to
take
her
quietly
with
me
to
the
station
where
we
have
women
who
can
make
sure
that
the
ruby
is
not
on
her
person
ashley
made
an
involuntary
gesture
of
strong
repugnance
let
us
pray
that
it
will
not
come
to
that
he
objected
hoarsely
such
a
fine
figure
of
a
girl
did
you
notice
how
bright
and
happy
she
looked
when
the
lights
sprang
up
i
declare
she
struck
me
as
lovely
so
she
did
me
and
caused
me
to
draw
some
erroneous
conclusions
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
procure
me
an
interview
with
her
as
soon
as
we
return
to
the
house
she
shall
meet
you
in
the
library
but
when
a
few
minutes
later
she
joined
me
in
the
room
just
designated
and
i
had
full
opportunity
for
reading
her
countenance
i
own
that
my
task
became
suddenly
hateful
to
me
she
was
not
far
from
my
own
daughter
age
and
had
it
not
been
for
her
furtive
look
of
care
appeared
almost
as
blooming
and
bright
would
it
ever
come
to
pass
that
a
harsh
man
of
the
law
would
feel
it
his
duty
to
speak
to
my
flora
as
i
must
now
speak
to
the
young
girl
before
me
the
thought
made
me
inwardly
recoil
and
it
was
in
as
gentle
a
manner
as
possible
that
i
made
my
bow
and
began
with
the
following
remark
i
hope
you
will
pardon
me
miss
glover
i
am
told
that
is
your
name
i
hate
to
disturb
your
pleasure
this
with
the
tears
of
alarm
and
grief
rising
in
her
eyes
but
you
can
tell
me
something
which
will
greatly
simplify
my
task
and
possibly
put
matters
in
such
shape
that
you
and
your
friends
can
be
released
to
your
homes
i
she
stood
before
me
with
amazed
eyes
the
color
rising
in
her
cheeks
i
had
to
force
my
next
words
which
out
of
consideration
for
her
i
made
as
direct
as
possible
yes
miss
what
was
the
article
you
were
seen
to
pick
up
from
the
driveway
soon
after
leaving
your
carriage
she
started
then
stumbled
backward
tripping
in
her
long
train
i
pick
up
she
murmured
then
with
a
blush
whether
of
anger
or
pride
i
could
not
tell
she
coldly
answered
oh
that
was
something
of
my
own
something
i
had
just
dropped
i
had
rather
not
tell
you
what
it
was
i
scrutinized
her
closely
she
met
my
eyes
squarely
yet
not
with
just
the
clear
light
i
should
remembering
flora
have
been
glad
to
see
there
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
be
entirely
frank
said
i
it
was
the
only
article
known
to
have
been
picked
up
from
the
driveway
after
deane
loss
of
the
ruby
and
though
we
do
not
presume
to
say
that
it
was
the
ruby
yet
the
matter
would
look
clearer
to
us
all
if
you
would
frankly
state
what
this
object
was
her
whole
body
seemed
to
collapse
and
she
looked
as
if
about
to
sink
oh
where
is
minnie
where
is
mr
deane
she
moaned
turning
and
staring
at
the
door
as
if
she
hoped
they
would
fly
to
her
aid
then
in
a
burst
of
indignation
which
i
was
fain
to
believe
real
she
turned
on
me
with
the
cry
it
was
a
bit
of
paper
which
i
had
thrust
into
the
bosom
of
my
gown
it
fell
out
your
dressmaker
bill
i
intimated
she
stared
laughed
hysterically
for
a
moment
then
sank
upon
a
sofa
sobbing
spasmodically
yes
she
cried
after
a
moment
my
dressmaker
bill
you
seem
to
know
all
my
affairs
then
suddenly
and
with
a
startling
impetuosity
which
drew
her
to
her
feet
are
you
going
to
tell
everybody
that
are
you
going
to
state
publicly
that
miss
glover
brought
an
unpaid
bill
to
the
party
and
that
because
deane
was
unfortunate
enough
or
careless
enough
to
drop
and
lose
the
jewel
he
was
bringing
to
burton
she
is
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
thief
because
she
stooped
to
pick
up
this
bill
which
had
slipped
inadvertently
from
its
i
shall
die
if
you
do
she
cried
i
shall
die
if
it
is
already
known
she
pursued
with
increasing
emotion
is
it
is
it
her
passion
was
so
great
so
much
greater
than
any
likely
to
rise
in
a
breast
wholly
innocent
that
i
began
to
feel
very
sober
no
one
but
ashley
and
possibly
her
son
know
about
the
bill
said
i
and
no
one
shall
if
you
will
go
with
that
lady
to
her
room
and
make
plain
to
her
in
the
only
way
you
can
that
the
extremely
valuable
article
which
has
been
lost
is
not
in
your
possession
she
threw
up
her
arms
with
a
scream
oh
what
a
horror
i
can
not
i
can
not
oh
i
shall
die
of
shame
my
father
my
mother
and
she
burst
from
the
room
like
one
distraught
but
in
another
moment
she
came
cringing
back
i
can
not
face
them
she
said
they
all
believe
it
they
will
always
believe
it
unless
i
submit
oh
why
did
i
ever
come
to
this
dreadful
place
why
did
i
order
this
hateful
dress
which
i
can
never
pay
for
and
which
in
spite
of
the
misery
it
has
caused
me
has
failed
to
bring
me
the
she
did
not
continue
she
had
caught
my
eye
and
seen
there
perhaps
some
evidence
of
the
pity
i
could
not
but
experience
for
her
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
she
advanced
upon
me
with
the
appeal
save
me
from
this
humiliation
i
have
not
seen
the
ruby
i
am
as
ignorant
of
its
whereabouts
as
as
ashley
himself
wo
you
believe
me
wo
they
be
satisfied
if
i
swear
i
was
really
sorry
for
her
i
began
to
think
too
that
some
dreadful
mistake
had
been
made
her
manner
seemed
too
ingenuous
for
guilt
yet
where
could
that
ruby
be
if
not
with
this
young
girl
certainly
all
other
possibilities
had
been
exhausted
and
her
story
of
the
bill
even
if
accepted
would
never
quite
exonerate
her
from
secret
suspicion
while
that
elusive
jewel
remained
unfound
you
give
me
no
hope
she
moaned
i
must
go
out
before
them
all
and
ask
to
have
it
proved
that
i
am
no
thief
oh
if
god
would
have
pity
or
some
one
would
find
halloo
what
that
a
shout
had
risen
from
the
hall
beyond
she
gasped
and
we
both
plunged
forward
ashley
still
in
his
overcoat
stood
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
and
facing
him
were
ranged
the
whole
line
of
young
people
whom
i
had
left
scattered
about
in
the
various
parlors
i
thought
he
looked
peculiar
certainly
his
appearance
differed
from
that
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
and
when
he
glanced
our
way
and
saw
who
was
standing
with
me
in
the
library
doorway
his
voice
took
on
a
tone
which
made
me
doubt
whether
he
was
about
to
announce
good
news
or
bad
but
his
first
word
settled
that
question
rejoice
with
me
he
cried
ruby
has
been
found
do
you
want
to
see
the
culprit
for
there
is
a
culprit
we
have
him
at
the
door
shall
we
bring
him
in
yes
yes
cried
several
voices
among
them
that
of
deane
who
now
strode
forward
with
beaming
eyes
and
instinctively
lifted
hand
but
some
of
the
ladies
looked
frightened
and
ashley
noting
this
glanced
for
encouragement
toward
us
he
seemed
to
find
it
in
miss
glover
eyes
she
had
quivered
and
nearly
fallen
at
that
word
but
had
drawn
herself
up
by
this
time
and
was
awaiting
his
further
action
in
a
fever
of
relief
and
hope
which
perhaps
no
one
but
myself
could
fully
appreciate
a
vile
thief
a
most
unconscionable
rascal
vociferated
ashley
you
must
see
him
mother
you
must
see
him
ladies
else
you
will
not
realize
our
good
fortune
open
the
door
there
and
bring
in
the
robber
at
this
command
uttered
in
ringing
tones
the
huge
leaves
of
the
great
front
door
swung
slowly
forward
revealing
the
sturdy
forms
of
the
two
stablemen
holding
down
by
main
force
the
towering
figure
of
the
scream
of
astonishment
which
went
up
from
all
sides
united
to
ashley
shout
of
hilarity
caused
the
animal
unused
no
doubt
to
to
rear
to
the
length
of
his
bridle
at
which
ashley
laughed
again
and
gaily
cried
confound
the
fellow
look
at
him
mother
look
at
him
ladies
do
you
not
see
guilt
written
on
his
brow
it
is
he
who
has
made
us
all
this
trouble
first
he
must
needs
take
umbrage
at
the
two
lights
with
which
we
presumed
to
illuminate
our
porch
then
envying
burton
her
ruby
and
deane
his
reward
seek
to
rob
them
both
by
grinding
his
hoofs
all
over
the
snow
of
the
driveway
till
he
came
upon
the
jewel
which
deane
had
dropped
from
his
pocket
and
taking
it
up
in
a
ball
of
snow
secrete
it
in
his
left
hind
shoe
where
it
might
be
yet
if
spencer
here
he
bowed
to
a
strange
gentleman
who
at
that
moment
entered
had
not
come
himself
for
his
daughters
and
going
first
to
the
stable
found
his
horse
so
restless
and
seemingly
lame
there
boys
you
may
take
the
wretch
away
now
and
harness
him
but
first
hold
up
that
guilty
left
hind
hoof
for
the
ladies
to
see
that
he
stooped
to
examine
him
and
so
came
upon
here
the
young
gentleman
brought
forward
his
hand
in
it
was
a
nondescript
little
wad
well
soaked
and
shapeless
but
once
he
had
untied
the
kid
such
a
ray
of
rosy
light
burst
from
his
outstretched
palm
that
i
doubt
if
a
single
woman
there
noted
the
clatter
of
the
retiring
beast
or
the
heavy
clang
made
by
the
two
front
doors
as
they
shut
upon
the
eyes
and
tongues
were
too
busy
and
ashley
realizing
probably
that
the
interest
of
all
present
would
remain
for
a
few
minutes
at
least
with
this
marvelous
jewel
so
astonishingly
recovered
laid
it
with
many
expressions
of
thankfulness
in
burton
now
eagerly
outstretched
palm
and
advancing
toward
us
paused
in
front
of
miss
glover
and
eagerly
held
out
his
hand
congratulate
me
he
prayed
all
our
troubles
are
over
oh
what
now
the
poor
young
thing
in
trying
to
smile
had
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
before
either
of
us
could
interpose
an
arm
she
had
slipped
to
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
with
a
murmur
of
pity
and
possibly
of
inward
contrition
he
stooped
over
her
and
together
we
carried
her
into
the
library
where
i
left
her
in
his
care
confident
from
certain
indications
that
my
presence
would
not
be
greatly
missed
by
either
of
them
whatever
hope
i
may
have
had
of
reaping
the
reward
offered
by
ashley
was
now
lost
but
in
the
satisfaction
i
experienced
at
finding
this
young
girl
as
innocent
as
my
flora
i
did
not
greatly
care
well
it
all
ended
even
more
happily
than
may
here
appear
the
horse
not
putting
in
his
claim
to
the
reward
and
spencer
repudiating
all
right
to
it
it
was
paid
in
full
to
deane
who
went
home
in
as
buoyant
a
state
of
mind
as
was
possible
to
him
after
the
great
anxieties
of
the
preceding
two
hours
miss
glover
was
sent
back
by
the
ashleys
in
their
own
carriage
and
i
was
told
that
ashley
declined
to
close
the
carriage
door
upon
her
till
she
had
promised
to
come
again
the
following
night
anxious
to
make
such
amends
as
i
personally
could
for
my
share
in
the
mortification
to
which
she
had
been
subjected
i
visited
her
in
the
morning
with
the
intention
of
offering
a
suggestion
or
two
in
regard
to
that
little
bill
but
she
met
my
first
advance
with
a
radiant
smile
and
the
glad
exclamation
oh
i
have
settled
all
that
i
have
just
come
from
madame
duprè
i
told
her
that
i
had
never
imagined
the
dress
could
possibly
cost
more
than
a
hundred
dollars
and
i
offered
her
that
sum
if
she
would
take
the
garment
back
and
she
did
she
did
and
i
shall
never
have
to
wear
that
dreadful
satin
again
i
made
a
note
of
this
dressmaker
name
she
and
i
may
have
a
bone
to
pick
some
day
but
i
said
nothing
to
miss
glover
i
merely
exclaimed
and
oh
i
have
an
old
spotted
muslin
which
with
a
few
natural
flowers
will
make
me
look
festive
enough
one
does
not
need
fine
clothes
when
one
is
happy
the
dreamy
smile
with
which
she
finished
the
sentence
was
more
eloquent
than
words
and
i
was
not
surprised
when
some
time
later
i
read
of
her
engagement
to
ashley
but
it
was
not
till
she
could
sign
herself
with
his
name
that
she
told
me
just
what
underlay
the
misery
of
that
night
she
had
met
harrison
ashley
more
than
once
before
and
though
she
did
not
say
so
had
evidently
conceived
an
admiration
for
him
which
made
her
especially
desirous
of
attracting
and
pleasing
him
not
understanding
the
world
very
well
certainly
having
very
little
knowledge
of
the
tastes
and
feelings
of
wealthy
people
she
conceived
that
the
more
brilliantly
she
was
attired
the
more
likely
she
would
be
to
please
this
rich
young
man
so
in
a
moment
of
weakness
she
decided
to
devote
all
her
small
savings
a
hundred
dollars
as
we
know
to
buying
a
gown
such
as
she
felt
she
could
appear
in
at
his
house
without
shame
it
came
home
as
dresses
from
french
dressmakers
are
very
apt
to
do
just
in
time
for
her
to
put
it
on
for
the
party
the
bill
came
with
it
and
when
she
saw
the
amount
it
was
all
itemized
and
she
could
find
no
fault
with
anything
but
the
summing
up
she
was
so
overwhelmed
that
she
nearly
fainted
but
she
could
not
give
up
her
ball
so
she
dressed
herself
and
being
urged
all
the
time
to
hurry
hardly
stopped
to
give
one
look
at
the
new
and
splendid
gown
which
had
cost
so
much
the
bill
the
incredible
the
enormous
bill
was
all
she
could
think
of
and
the
figures
which
represented
nearly
her
whole
year
earnings
danced
constantly
before
her
eyes
how
to
pay
it
but
she
could
not
pay
it
nor
could
she
ask
her
father
to
do
so
she
was
ruined
but
the
ball
and
ashley
these
still
awaited
her
so
presently
she
worked
herself
up
to
some
anticipation
of
enjoyment
and
having
thrown
on
her
cloak
was
turning
down
her
light
preparatory
to
departure
when
her
eye
fell
on
the
bill
lying
open
on
her
dresser
it
would
never
do
to
leave
it
there
never
do
to
leave
it
anywhere
in
her
room
there
were
prying
eyes
in
the
house
and
she
was
as
ashamed
of
that
bill
as
she
might
have
been
of
a
contemplated
theft
so
she
tucked
it
in
her
corsage
and
went
down
to
join
her
friends
in
the
carriage
the
rest
we
know
all
but
one
small
detail
which
turned
to
gall
whatever
enjoyment
she
was
able
to
get
out
of
the
early
evening
there
was
a
young
girl
present
dressed
in
a
simple
muslin
gown
while
looking
at
it
and
inwardly
contrasting
it
with
her
own
splendor
ashley
passed
by
with
another
gentleman
and
she
heard
him
say
how
much
better
young
girls
look
in
simple
white
than
in
the
elaborate
silks
only
suitable
for
their
mothers
thoughtless
words
possibly
forgotten
as
soon
as
uttered
but
they
sharply
pierced
this
already
sufficiently
stricken
and
uneasy
breast
and
were
the
cause
of
the
tears
which
had
aroused
my
suspicion
when
i
came
upon
her
in
the
library
standing
with
her
face
to
the
night
but
who
can
say
whether
if
the
evening
had
been
devoid
of
these
occurrences
and
no
emotions
of
contrition
and
pity
had
been
awakened
in
her
behalf
in
the
breast
of
her
chivalrous
host
she
would
ever
have
become
ashley
the
hermit
of
street
chapter
i
i
commit
an
indiscretion
i
should
have
kept
my
eyes
for
the
many
brilliant
and
interesting
sights
constantly
offered
me
i
might
have
done
so
had
i
been
ever
eighteen
or
had
i
not
come
from
the
country
i
was
visiting
in
a
house
where
fashionable
people
made
life
a
perpetual
holiday
yet
of
all
the
pleasures
which
followed
so
rapidly
one
upon
another
the
greatest
was
the
hour
i
spent
in
my
window
after
the
dissipations
were
all
over
watching
a
man
face
bending
night
after
night
over
a
in
the
lower
room
of
the
great
house
in
our
rear
why
did
it
affect
me
so
it
was
not
a
young
face
but
it
was
very
handsome
and
it
was
enigmatic
the
day
following
my
arrival
in
the
city
i
had
noticed
the
large
house
in
our
rear
and
had
asked
some
questions
about
it
it
had
a
peculiarly
secluded
and
secretive
look
the
windows
were
all
shuttered
and
closed
with
the
exception
of
the
three
on
the
lower
floor
and
two
others
directly
over
these
on
the
top
story
they
were
even
boarded
up
giving
to
that
portion
of
the
house
a
blank
and
desolate
air
the
grounds
were
separated
from
the
street
by
a
brick
wall
in
our
direction
the
line
of
separation
was
marked
by
a
high
iron
fence
in
which
i
saw
a
gate
the
vandykes
whom
i
had
questioned
on
the
matter
were
very
short
in
their
replies
but
i
learned
this
much
that
the
house
belonged
to
one
of
new
york
oldest
families
that
its
present
owner
was
a
widow
of
great
eccentricity
of
character
who
with
her
one
child
a
daughter
unfortunately
blind
from
birth
had
taken
up
her
abode
in
some
foreign
country
where
she
thought
her
child
affliction
would
attract
less
attention
than
in
her
native
city
the
house
had
been
closed
to
the
extent
i
have
mentioned
immediately
upon
her
departure
but
had
not
been
left
entirely
empty
allison
her
man
of
business
had
moved
into
it
and
being
fully
as
eccentric
as
herself
had
contented
himself
for
five
years
with
a
solitary
life
in
this
dismal
mansion
without
friends
almost
without
acquaintances
though
he
might
have
had
unlimited
society
and
any
amount
of
attention
his
personal
attractions
being
of
a
very
uncommon
order
and
his
talent
for
business
so
pronounced
that
he
was
already
recognized
at
as
one
of
the
men
to
be
afraid
of
in
wall
street
of
his
birth
and
connections
little
was
known
he
was
called
the
hermit
of
street
i
was
not
very
well
one
day
and
i
had
been
left
alone
in
the
house
at
seven
how
well
i
remember
the
hour
i
was
sitting
in
my
window
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
vandykes
and
watching
the
face
which
had
now
appeared
at
its
usual
place
in
the
study
suddenly
my
attention
was
drawn
from
him
to
a
window
in
the
story
over
his
head
by
the
rapid
blowing
in
and
out
of
a
curtain
as
there
was
a
lighted
near
by
i
watched
the
gyrating
muslin
with
apprehension
and
was
shocked
when
in
another
moment
i
saw
the
flimsy
folds
give
one
wild
flap
and
flare
up
into
a
dangerous
flame
i
dashed
out
of
my
room
calling
for
the
servants
but
lucy
was
in
the
front
area
and
ellen
above
and
i
was
on
the
back
porch
and
in
the
garden
before
either
of
them
responded
meanwhile
no
movement
was
observable
in
the
brooding
figure
of
allison
i
sprang
through
the
gate
and
knocked
with
all
my
might
on
a
door
which
opened
upon
a
side
porch
confronting
me
with
dilating
eyes
he
faltered
slowly
back
till
his
natural
instincts
of
courtesy
recalled
him
to
himself
and
he
bowed
when
i
found
courage
to
cry
fire
your
house
is
on
fire
up
there
overhead
so
intense
were
the
feelings
i
saw
aroused
in
him
that
i
expected
to
see
him
rush
into
the
open
air
with
loud
cries
for
help
but
instead
he
pushed
the
door
to
behind
me
and
locking
me
in
said
in
a
strange
tone
do
call
out
do
make
any
sound
or
outcry
and
above
all
let
any
one
in
i
will
fight
the
flames
alone
and
seizing
a
lamp
from
the
he
dashed
from
me
toward
a
staircase
i
could
see
in
the
distance
alas
it
was
a
thrilling
look
a
look
which
no
girl
could
sustain
without
emotion
and
spellbound
under
it
i
stood
in
a
maze
alone
and
in
utter
darkness
while
my
emotions
were
at
their
height
a
bell
rang
it
was
the
front
and
it
meant
the
arrival
of
the
engines
as
the
bell
rang
a
second
time
a
light
broke
on
the
staircase
i
was
so
painfully
watching
and
allison
descended
lamp
in
hand
as
he
had
gone
up
what
passed
between
him
and
the
policeman
whose
voice
i
heard
in
the
hall
i
do
not
know
i
finally
heard
the
front
door
close
i
must
have
met
him
with
a
pleading
aspect
very
much
like
that
of
a
frightened
child
for
his
countenance
changed
as
he
approached
me
my
dear
young
lady
how
can
i
thank
you
enough
and
how
can
i
sufficiently
express
my
regret
at
having
kept
you
a
prisoner
in
this
blazing
house
had
he
stopped
again
i
was
in
such
a
state
of
inner
perturbation
that
i
hardly
knew
whether
he
had
ceased
to
speak
or
i
to
hear
may
i
ask
whom
i
have
the
honor
of
addressing
he
asked
in
a
tone
i
might
better
never
have
heard
from
his
lips
i
am
delight
hunter
a
country
girl
sir
visiting
the
vandykes
then
as
my
lips
settled
into
a
determined
curve
he
himself
opened
the
door
and
bowing
low
asked
if
i
would
accept
his
protection
to
the
gate
declining
his
offer
with
a
wild
shake
of
the
head
i
dashed
from
the
house
and
fled
with
an
incomprehensible
sense
of
relief
back
to
that
of
the
vandykes
the
servants
who
had
seen
me
rush
toward
allison
were
still
in
the
yard
watching
for
me
i
did
not
vouchsafe
them
a
word
i
could
hardly
formulate
words
in
my
own
mind
a
great
love
and
a
great
dread
had
seized
upon
me
at
once
chapter
ii
a
strange
wedding
breakfast
allison
who
had
never
before
been
known
to
leave
his
books
and
papers
not
only
called
the
next
day
to
express
his
gratitude
for
what
he
was
pleased
to
style
my
invaluable
warning
but
came
every
day
after
after
he
became
an
habitué
of
the
house
vandyke
grew
more
communicative
in
regard
to
him
ransome
the
lady
in
whose
house
he
lived
had
left
her
home
very
suddenly
he
anticipated
a
like
return
so
ever
since
her
departure
it
had
been
his
invariable
custom
to
have
the
table
set
for
three
so
that
he
might
never
be
surprised
by
her
arrival
it
had
become
a
monomania
with
him
never
did
he
sit
down
without
there
being
enough
before
him
for
a
small
family
and
as
his
food
was
all
brought
in
cooked
from
a
neighboring
restaurant
this
eccentricity
of
his
was
well
known
and
gave
an
added
éclat
to
his
otherwise
habits
to
my
mind
it
added
an
element
of
pathos
to
his
seclusion
and
so
affected
me
that
one
day
i
dared
to
remark
to
him
you
must
have
liked
ransome
very
much
you
are
so
faithful
in
your
remembrance
of
her
i
never
presumed
again
to
attack
any
of
his
foibles
he
gave
me
first
a
hard
look
then
an
indulgent
one
and
finally
managed
to
say
after
a
moment
of
quiet
hesitation
you
allude
to
my
custom
of
setting
two
chairs
at
the
table
to
which
they
may
return
at
any
minute
miss
hunter
what
i
do
in
the
loneliness
of
that
great
house
is
not
worth
the
gossip
of
those
who
surround
you
flushing
till
i
wished
my
curls
would
fall
down
and
hide
my
cheeks
i
tried
to
stammer
out
some
apology
but
he
drove
it
back
with
a
passionate
word
you
love
me
delight
he
was
already
pressing
me
in
his
arms
you
love
me
or
you
would
never
have
rushed
so
impetuously
to
warn
me
of
my
danger
that
night
make
me
the
maddest
happiest
man
in
all
the
world
i
hardly
realized
what
i
had
done
till
i
stood
abashed
before
vandyke
and
told
her
i
had
engaged
myself
to
marry
allison
before
he
went
to
europe
then
it
seemed
i
had
done
a
very
good
thing
she
congratulated
me
heartily
and
seeing
i
had
certain
fear
of
taking
my
aunt
into
my
confidence
promised
to
sit
down
and
write
to
her
herself
using
every
encomium
she
could
think
of
to
make
this
sudden
marriage
on
my
part
seem
like
the
result
of
reason
and
wise
forethought
i
had
not
what
every
one
else
seemed
to
have
full
confidence
in
this
man
and
yet
the
thrall
in
which
i
was
held
by
the
dominating
power
of
his
passion
kept
me
from
seeking
that
advice
even
from
my
own
intuitions
which
might
have
led
to
my
preservation
i
was
blind
and
knew
i
was
blind
yet
rushed
on
headlong
i
asked
him
no
questions
till
our
wedding
day
we
were
married
simply
but
to
the
sound
of
wonderful
music
in
a
certain
little
church
not
far
from
street
allison
had
told
me
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
take
me
out
of
the
city
at
present
it
was
therefore
to
the
house
on
street
we
were
driven
in
the
hall
stood
the
old
serving
man
with
whose
appearance
i
was
already
so
familiar
luncheon
is
served
he
announced
with
great
formality
and
then
i
saw
through
an
open
door
the
glitter
of
china
and
glass
and
realized
i
was
about
to
take
my
first
meal
with
my
husband
the
next
moment
i
was
before
the
board
which
had
been
made
as
beautiful
as
possible
with
flowers
and
the
finest
of
dinner
services
but
the
table
was
set
for
four
two
of
whom
could
only
be
present
in
spirit
i
wondered
if
i
were
glad
or
sorry
to
see
it
if
i
were
pleased
with
his
loyalty
to
his
absent
employer
or
disappointed
that
my
presence
had
not
made
everybody
else
forgotten
to
be
consistent
i
should
have
rejoiced
at
this
evidence
of
sterling
worth
on
his
part
but
girls
are
not
consistent
at
least
brides
of
an
hour
are
not
and
i
may
have
pouted
the
least
bit
in
the
world
as
i
pointed
to
the
two
places
set
as
elaborately
as
our
own
and
said
with
the
daring
which
comes
with
the
rights
of
a
wife
it
would
be
a
startling
coincidence
if
ransome
and
her
daughter
should
return
i
fear
i
would
not
like
it
i
was
looking
directly
at
him
as
i
spoke
with
a
smile
on
my
lips
and
my
hand
on
the
back
of
my
chair
but
the
jest
i
had
expected
in
reply
did
not
come
something
in
my
tone
or
choice
of
topic
jarred
upon
him
and
his
answer
was
a
simple
wave
of
his
hand
toward
ambrose
who
at
once
relieved
me
of
my
bouquet
placing
it
in
a
tall
glass
at
the
side
of
my
plate
now
we
will
sit
said
he
i
do
not
know
how
the
meal
would
have
passed
had
ambrose
not
been
present
as
it
was
it
was
a
rather
formal
affair
and
would
have
been
slightly
depressing
if
i
had
not
caught
now
and
then
flashing
glances
from
my
husband
eye
which
assured
me
that
he
found
as
much
to
enchain
him
in
my
presence
as
i
did
in
his
chapter
iii
one
bead
from
a
necklace
after
supper
allison
put
before
me
a
large
book
amuse
yourself
with
these
pictures
said
he
i
have
a
little
task
to
perform
after
it
is
done
i
will
come
again
and
sit
with
you
you
are
not
going
out
i
cried
starting
up
no
he
smiled
i
am
not
going
out
i
sank
back
and
opened
the
book
but
i
did
not
look
at
the
pictures
instead
of
that
i
listened
to
his
steps
moving
about
the
house
rear
and
front
and
finally
going
up
what
seemed
to
be
a
servant
staircase
for
i
could
see
the
great
front
stairs
from
where
i
sat
and
there
was
no
one
on
them
but
when
he
returned
and
sat
down
i
said
nothing
there
was
a
little
thing
i
noted
however
his
hands
were
trembling
and
it
was
five
minutes
before
he
met
my
inquiring
look
i
will
not
displease
him
with
questions
i
decided
but
i
will
find
my
own
way
into
those
lofts
above
i
shall
never
be
at
rest
till
i
do
i
had
found
a
candle
in
my
bedroom
and
this
i
took
to
light
me
but
it
revealed
nothing
to
me
except
a
double
row
of
unused
rooms
with
dust
on
the
handles
of
all
the
doors
i
scrutinized
them
all
for
young
as
i
was
i
had
wit
enough
to
see
that
if
i
could
find
one
knob
on
which
no
dust
lay
that
would
be
the
one
my
husband
was
accustomed
to
turn
but
every
one
showed
tokens
of
not
having
been
touched
in
years
and
baffled
in
my
search
i
was
about
to
retreat
when
i
remembered
that
the
house
had
four
stories
and
that
i
had
not
yet
come
upon
the
staircase
leading
to
the
one
above
a
hurried
search
for
i
was
mortally
afraid
of
being
surprised
by
my
husband
revealed
to
me
at
last
a
distant
door
which
had
no
dust
on
its
knob
it
lay
at
the
bottom
of
a
staircase
and
convinced
that
here
was
the
place
my
husband
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
i
carefully
fingered
the
knob
which
turned
very
softly
in
my
hand
but
it
did
not
open
the
door
there
was
a
lock
visible
just
below
and
that
lock
was
fastened
my
first
escapade
was
without
visible
results
but
i
was
uneasy
from
that
hour
i
imagined
all
sorts
of
things
hidden
beyond
that
closed
door
i
was
walking
one
morning
in
the
grounds
that
lay
about
the
house
when
suddenly
i
felt
something
small
but
perceptibly
hard
strike
my
hat
and
bound
quickly
off
in
another
instant
i
started
up
i
had
found
a
little
thing
like
a
bullet
wrapped
up
in
paper
but
it
was
no
bullet
it
was
a
bead
a
large
gold
bead
and
on
the
paper
which
surrounded
it
were
written
these
words
help
from
the
passing
stranger
i
am
elizabeth
ransome
owner
of
the
house
in
which
i
have
been
imprisoned
five
years
search
for
me
in
the
upper
story
you
will
find
me
there
with
my
blind
daughter
he
who
placed
us
here
is
below
beware
his
cunning
chapter
iv
i
learn
hypocrisy
even
in
that
rush
of
confusing
emotions
i
recognized
one
fact
that
i
must
not
betray
by
look
or
word
that
i
knew
this
dreadful
secret
so
i
went
in
but
went
in
slowly
and
with
downcast
eyes
the
bead
and
the
paper
i
had
dropped
into
my
vinaigrette
which
fortunately
hung
at
my
side
humphrey
i
said
when
are
we
going
to
leave
this
house
i
begin
to
find
it
lonesome
he
was
preparing
to
gather
up
his
papers
for
his
accustomed
trip
but
he
stopped
as
i
spoke
and
looked
at
me
curiously
you
are
pale
he
remarked
change
and
travel
will
benefit
you
dearest
we
will
try
to
sail
for
europe
in
a
week
chapter
v
the
stolen
key
it
became
apparent
even
to
my
girlish
mind
that
as
the
wife
of
the
man
who
had
committed
this
great
and
inconceivable
wrong
i
was
bound
not
only
to
make
an
immediate
attempt
to
release
the
women
he
so
outrageously
held
imprisoned
in
their
own
house
but
to
release
them
so
that
he
should
escape
the
opprobrium
of
his
own
act
that
i
might
have
time
to
think
and
that
i
might
be
saved
if
but
for
one
day
contact
with
one
it
was
almost
my
duty
to
hate
i
came
back
to
him
with
the
plea
that
i
might
spend
the
day
with
the
vandykes
instead
of
accompanying
him
as
usual
i
think
he
was
glad
of
the
freedom
my
absence
offered
him
for
he
gave
me
the
permission
i
asked
and
in
ten
minutes
i
was
in
my
old
home
vandyke
received
me
with
effusion
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
seen
me
since
my
marriage
but
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
me
alone
my
dear
she
exclaimed
turning
me
about
till
my
unwilling
face
met
the
light
is
this
the
lassie
i
gave
into
keeping
a
week
ago
it
is
the
house
i
excitedly
gasped
the
empty
lonely
echoing
house
i
am
afraid
in
it
even
with
my
husband
it
gives
me
creepy
feelings
as
if
a
murder
had
been
committed
in
it
she
broke
into
a
laugh
i
hear
the
sound
now
an
honest
amused
and
entirely
reassuring
laugh
that
relieved
me
in
one
way
and
depressed
me
in
another
i
ventured
on
another
attempt
to
clear
up
the
mystery
that
was
fast
stifling
out
my
youth
love
and
hope
i
professed
to
have
an
extraordinary
desire
to
see
the
city
from
the
i
had
never
been
any
higher
up
than
the
third
story
of
any
house
i
had
been
in
and
could
not
i
told
her
go
any
higher
in
the
house
in
which
i
was
then
living
might
i
go
up
on
her
roof
her
eyes
opened
but
she
was
of
an
amiable
inconsequent
disposition
and
let
me
have
my
way
without
too
much
opposition
one
glance
at
the
spot
i
was
most
interested
in
and
i
found
myself
too
dizzy
to
look
further
in
the
center
of
ransome
roof
there
was
to
be
seen
what
i
can
best
describe
as
an
extended
cupola
without
windows
as
there
was
no
other
break
visible
in
the
roof
the
top
of
this
must
have
held
the
skylight
which
being
thus
lifted
many
feet
above
the
level
of
the
garret
floor
would
admit
air
and
light
enough
to
the
space
below
but
would
make
any
effort
to
be
heard
or
seen
on
the
part
of
any
one
secreted
there
quite
ineffectual
the
resolution
i
took
was
worthy
of
an
older
head
and
a
more
disciplined
heart
by
means
that
were
fair
or
by
means
that
were
foul
i
meant
to
win
my
way
into
that
attic
and
see
for
myself
if
the
words
hidden
away
in
my
vinaigrette
were
true
to
do
this
openly
would
cause
a
scandal
i
was
yet
too
much
under
my
husband
influence
to
risk
while
to
do
it
secretly
meant
the
obtaining
of
keys
which
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
he
kept
hidden
about
his
person
how
was
i
to
obtain
them
i
saw
no
way
but
that
did
not
deter
me
from
starting
at
once
in
the
hope
of
being
struck
by
some
brilliant
idea
while
waiting
for
him
in
his
office
was
it
instinct
that
suggested
this
or
was
the
hand
of
providence
in
all
that
i
did
at
this
time
i
had
no
sooner
seated
myself
in
the
little
room
where
i
had
been
accustomed
to
wait
for
him
than
i
saw
what
sent
the
blood
tinkling
to
my
in
sudden
hope
it
was
my
vest
hanging
in
one
corner
the
vest
he
had
worn
that
morning
the
day
was
warm
and
he
had
taken
it
off
if
the
key
should
be
in
it
i
had
never
done
a
mean
or
underhanded
thing
before
in
my
life
but
i
sprang
at
that
vest
without
the
least
hesitation
and
fingering
it
was
the
lightest
of
touches
found
in
the
smallest
of
inside
pockets
a
key
which
instinct
immediately
told
me
was
that
of
the
door
i
had
once
endeavored
to
pass
dropping
the
key
into
my
pocket
i
went
back
into
the
outer
room
and
leaving
word
that
i
had
remembered
a
little
shopping
which
would
take
me
again
i
left
the
building
and
returned
to
street
i
was
out
of
breath
with
suspense
as
well
as
with
my
rapid
movements
when
i
reached
the
staircase
and
carefully
unlocked
its
narrow
door
but
by
the
time
i
had
reached
the
fourth
floor
and
unlocked
with
the
same
key
the
only
other
door
that
had
a
streak
of
light
under
it
i
had
gained
a
certain
degree
of
tense
composure
born
of
the
desperate
nature
of
the
occasion
the
calmness
with
which
i
pushed
open
the
door
proved
this
a
calmness
which
made
the
movement
noiseless
which
was
the
reason
i
suppose
why
i
was
enabled
to
suppress
the
shriek
that
rose
to
my
lips
as
i
saw
that
the
room
had
occupants
and
that
my
worst
fears
were
thus
realized
a
woman
was
sitting
with
her
back
to
me
at
a
table
and
before
her
with
her
face
turned
my
way
was
a
young
girl
in
whom
even
at
first
glance
i
detected
some
likeness
to
myself
was
this
why
countenance
expressed
so
much
agitation
when
he
first
saw
me
the
next
moment
this
latter
lifted
her
head
and
looked
directly
at
me
but
with
no
change
in
her
mobile
features
at
which
token
of
blindness
i
almost
fell
on
my
knees
so
conclusively
did
it
prove
that
i
was
really
looking
upon
ransome
and
her
daughter
the
mother
who
had
been
directing
her
daughter
hands
in
some
needlework
felt
that
the
latter
attention
had
been
diverted
what
is
it
dear
she
asked
with
an
indescribable
mellowness
of
voice
whose
tone
thrilled
me
with
a
fresh
and
passionate
pity
i
thought
i
heard
allison
come
in
but
he
always
knocks
besides
it
is
not
time
for
him
yet
and
she
sighed
that
sigh
went
through
my
heart
rousing
new
feelings
and
deeper
terrors
but
i
had
no
time
to
indulge
in
them
for
the
mother
turned
at
the
gasp
which
left
my
lips
and
rising
up
confronted
me
with
an
amazement
which
left
her
without
any
ability
to
speak
who
is
it
mother
inquired
the
blind
girl
herself
rising
and
beaming
upon
me
with
the
sweetest
of
looks
let
me
answer
i
ventured
softly
i
am
allison
wife
i
have
come
to
see
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
to
make
your
stay
here
more
comfortable
the
look
that
passed
over
the
mother
face
warned
me
to
venture
no
further
in
the
daughter
presence
whatever
that
mother
had
suffered
the
daughter
had
experienced
nothing
but
satisfied
love
and
companionship
in
these
narrow
precincts
her
rounded
cheeks
showed
this
and
the
indescribable
atmosphere
of
peace
and
gladness
which
surrounded
her
as
i
saw
this
and
realized
the
mother
life
and
the
which
had
enabled
her
to
accept
the
inevitable
without
raising
a
complaint
calculated
to
betray
to
the
daughter
that
all
was
not
as
it
should
be
with
them
i
felt
such
a
rush
of
awe
sweep
over
me
that
some
of
my
fathomless
emotion
showed
in
my
face
for
ransome
own
countenance
assumed
a
milder
look
and
advancing
nearer
she
pointed
out
a
room
where
we
could
speak
apart
as
i
moved
toward
it
she
whispered
a
few
words
in
her
daughter
ear
then
she
rejoined
me
oh
madame
i
murmured
oh
madame
show
a
poor
girl
what
she
can
do
to
restore
you
to
your
rights
the
door
is
open
and
you
can
descend
but
that
means
oh
madame
i
am
filled
with
terror
when
i
think
what
he
may
be
in
the
hall
now
he
may
have
missed
the
key
and
returned
if
only
you
were
out
of
the
house
my
dear
girl
she
quietly
replied
we
will
be
some
day
you
will
see
to
that
i
know
i
do
not
think
i
could
stay
here
now
that
i
have
seen
another
face
than
his
but
i
do
not
want
to
go
now
i
want
to
prepare
theresa
for
freedom
she
has
lived
so
long
quietly
with
me
that
i
dread
the
shock
and
excitement
of
other
voices
and
the
pressure
of
city
sounds
upon
her
delicate
ears
i
must
train
her
for
contact
with
the
world
but
you
wo
forget
me
if
i
allow
you
to
lock
us
in
again
you
will
come
back
and
open
the
doors
and
let
me
go
down
again
through
my
old
halls
into
the
room
where
my
husband
died
and
if
allison
objects
my
dear
girl
you
know
now
that
he
is
an
unscrupulous
man
that
it
is
my
money
he
begrudged
me
and
that
he
has
used
it
and
made
himself
a
rich
man
i
can
not
i
murmured
i
can
not
find
courage
to
present
the
subject
to
him
so
i
do
not
know
my
husband
mind
it
is
a
fathomless
abyss
to
me
let
me
think
of
some
other
way
oh
madam
if
you
were
out
of
the
house
and
could
then
come
suddenly
a
thought
struck
me
i
can
do
it
i
see
the
way
to
do
it
a
way
that
will
place
you
in
a
triumphant
position
and
yet
save
him
from
suspicion
he
is
weary
of
this
care
he
wants
to
be
relieved
of
the
dreadful
secret
which
anchors
him
to
this
house
and
makes
a
hell
of
the
very
spot
in
which
he
has
fixed
his
love
shall
we
to
do
this
for
him
can
you
trust
me
if
i
promise
to
take
an
immediate
impression
of
this
key
and
have
one
made
for
myself
which
shall
insure
my
return
here
my
dear
she
said
taking
my
head
between
her
two
trembling
hands
i
have
never
looked
upon
a
sweeter
face
than
my
daughter
till
i
looked
upon
yours
if
you
bid
me
hope
i
will
hope
and
if
you
bid
me
trust
i
will
trust
the
remembrance
of
this
kiss
will
not
let
you
forget
and
she
embraced
me
in
a
warm
and
tender
manner
i
will
write
you
i
murmured
some
day
look
for
a
billet
under
the
door
it
will
tell
you
what
to
do
now
i
must
go
back
to
my
husband
when
i
reached
the
office
i
was
in
a
fainting
condition
but
all
my
hopes
revived
again
when
i
saw
the
vest
still
hanging
where
i
had
left
it
and
heard
my
husband
voice
singing
cheerfully
in
the
adjoining
room
chapter
vi
while
others
danced
a
crowd
in
the
street
house
was
necessary
to
the
quiet
escape
of
ransome
and
her
daughter
so
a
crowd
we
must
have
and
how
have
a
crowd
without
giving
a
grand
party
i
knew
that
this
would
be
a
shocking
proposition
to
him
but
i
was
prepared
to
meet
all
objections
and
when
with
every
nerve
alert
and
every
charm
exerted
to
its
utmost
i
sat
down
at
his
side
that
evening
to
plead
my
cause
i
knew
by
the
sparkle
of
his
eye
and
the
softening
of
the
bitter
lines
that
sometimes
hardened
his
mouth
that
the
battle
was
half
won
before
i
spoke
and
that
i
should
have
my
party
whatever
it
might
cost
him
in
mental
stress
and
worry
the
next
thing
i
did
was
to
procure
a
facsimile
of
his
key
from
the
wax
impression
i
had
taken
of
it
in
accordance
with
my
promise
to
ransome
then
i
wrote
her
a
letter
in
which
i
gave
her
the
minutest
directions
as
to
her
own
movements
on
that
important
evening
after
which
i
gave
myself
up
entirely
to
the
business
of
the
party
certain
things
i
had
insisted
on
all
the
rooms
were
to
be
opened
even
those
on
the
third
floor
and
i
was
to
have
a
band
to
play
in
the
hall
he
did
not
deny
me
anything
i
think
his
judgment
was
asleep
or
else
he
was
so
taken
up
with
the
horrible
problem
presented
by
his
desire
to
leave
the
city
and
the
existence
of
those
obligations
which
made
departure
an
impossibility
that
he
failed
to
place
due
stress
on
matters
which
at
another
time
might
very
well
seem
to
threaten
the
disclosure
of
his
dangerous
secret
at
last
the
night
came
an
entertainment
given
in
this
great
house
had
aroused
much
interest
most
of
our
invitations
had
been
accepted
and
the
affair
promised
to
be
brilliant
as
a
bride
i
wore
white
and
when
at
the
moment
of
going
my
husband
suddenly
clasped
about
my
neck
a
rich
necklace
of
diamonds
i
was
seized
by
such
a
bitter
sense
of
the
contrast
between
appearances
and
the
awful
reality
underlying
these
festivities
that
i
reeled
in
his
arms
and
had
to
employ
all
the
arts
which
my
dangerous
position
had
taught
me
to
quiet
his
alarm
and
convince
him
that
my
emotion
sprang
entirely
from
pleasure
meantime
the
orchestra
was
playing
and
the
equipages
were
rolling
up
in
front
what
he
thought
as
the
music
filled
the
house
and
rose
in
piercing
melody
to
the
very
roof
i
can
not
say
i
thought
how
it
was
a
message
of
release
to
those
weary
and
abused
ones
above
and
filled
with
the
sense
of
support
which
the
presence
of
so
many
people
in
the
house
gave
me
i
drew
up
my
girlish
figure
in
glad
excitement
and
prepared
myself
for
the
ordeal
visible
and
invisible
which
awaited
me
the
next
two
hours
form
a
blank
in
my
memory
standing
under
ransome
picture
i
would
stand
there
i
received
the
congratulations
of
the
hundred
or
more
people
who
were
anxious
to
see
bride
and
of
the
whole
glittering
pageant
i
remember
only
the
whispered
words
of
vandyke
as
she
passed
with
the
rest
my
dear
i
take
back
what
i
said
the
other
day
about
the
effect
of
marriage
upon
you
you
are
the
most
brilliant
woman
here
and
allison
the
happiest
of
men
this
was
an
indication
that
all
was
going
well
but
what
of
the
awful
morning
hour
that
awaited
us
would
that
show
him
a
happy
man
at
last
our
guests
were
assembled
and
i
had
an
instant
to
myself
murmuring
a
prayer
for
courage
i
slid
from
the
room
and
ran
here
all
was
bustle
also
a
bustle
i
delighted
in
for
with
so
many
people
moving
about
ransome
and
her
daughter
could
pass
out
without
attracting
more
than
a
momentary
attention
securing
a
bundle
i
had
myself
prepared
i
glided
up
the
second
staircase
and
after
a
moment
delay
succeeded
in
unlocking
the
door
and
disappearing
with
my
bundle
into
the
fourth
story
when
i
came
down
the
key
i
had
carried
up
was
left
behind
me
the
way
for
escape
lay
open
i
do
not
think
i
had
been
gone
ten
minutes
from
the
when
i
returned
there
it
was
to
find
the
festivities
at
their
height
and
my
husband
just
on
the
point
of
missing
me
the
look
which
he
directed
toward
me
pierced
me
to
the
heart
not
that
i
was
playing
him
false
for
i
was
risking
life
love
and
the
loss
of
everything
i
prized
to
save
him
from
himself
but
that
his
love
for
me
should
be
so
strong
he
could
forget
the
two
tortured
hearts
above
in
the
admiration
i
had
awakened
in
the
shallow
people
about
us
but
i
smiled
as
a
woman
on
the
rack
might
smile
if
the
safety
of
her
loved
ones
depended
on
her
courage
and
nerving
myself
for
the
suspense
of
such
a
waiting
as
few
of
my
inexperience
have
ever
been
called
upon
to
endure
i
turned
to
a
group
of
ladies
i
saw
near
me
and
began
to
talk
happily
i
did
not
have
to
chatter
long
happily
ransome
was
quick
in
her
movements
and
exact
in
all
she
did
and
sooner
than
i
expected
sooner
perhaps
than
i
was
prepared
for
it
the
man
who
attended
the
front
door
came
to
my
side
and
informed
me
that
a
lady
wished
to
see
me
a
lady
who
had
just
arrived
from
the
steamer
and
who
said
she
was
the
mistress
of
the
house
ransome
ransome
the
name
spread
like
but
before
any
movement
was
made
i
had
bounded
in
laughing
confusion
to
my
husband
side
and
grasping
him
merrily
by
the
arm
cried
your
expectations
have
come
true
ransome
has
returned
without
warning
and
she
will
partake
of
the
supper
you
have
always
had
served
for
her
the
shock
was
as
great
perhaps
as
ever
man
received
i
knew
what
it
was
likely
to
be
and
held
him
upright
with
the
seeming
merriment
in
my
eyes
which
i
did
not
allow
to
stray
from
his
he
thought
i
was
mad
then
he
thought
he
was
then
i
recalled
him
to
the
dangers
and
exigencies
of
the
moment
by
saying
with
forced
naiveté
shall
i
go
and
welcome
her
to
this
gathering
in
her
own
house
or
will
you
do
the
honors
she
may
not
know
me
he
moved
but
as
a
statue
might
move
shot
through
and
through
with
an
electric
spark
i
saw
that
i
must
act
rather
than
he
so
uttering
some
girlish
sentence
about
the
mice
and
cat
i
glided
away
into
the
hall
where
ransome
stood
in
the
nondescript
black
coat
and
bonnet
i
had
provided
her
from
her
own
wardrobe
she
had
slipped
a
few
moments
before
from
the
house
with
her
daughter
whom
she
had
placed
in
a
carriage
which
i
had
ordered
to
wait
for
them
directly
in
front
of
the
and
had
now
as
the
mistress
returning
unexpectedly
after
a
departure
of
five
years
all
had
been
done
as
i
had
planned
and
it
only
remained
to
carry
on
the
farce
and
prevent
its
developing
into
a
tragedy
rushing
up
to
her
i
told
her
who
i
was
and
as
we
were
literally
surrounded
in
a
moment
added
such
apologies
for
the
merrymaking
in
which
she
found
us
indulging
as
my
wit
suggested
and
the
occasion
seemed
to
demand
then
i
allowed
her
to
speak
instantly
she
was
the
mistress
of
the
house
as
her
dress
was
and
changed
as
her
figure
must
have
been
she
had
that
imposing
bearing
which
great
misfortune
nobly
borne
gives
to
some
natures
and
feeling
the
eyes
of
many
of
her
old
friends
upon
her
she
graciously
smiled
and
said
that
she
was
delighted
to
receive
so
public
a
welcome
then
she
took
me
by
the
hand
do
not
worry
child
she
said
i
have
a
daughter
about
your
age
which
in
itself
would
make
me
lenient
toward
one
so
young
and
pretty
where
is
your
husband
dear
he
has
served
me
well
in
my
absence
and
i
should
like
to
shake
hands
with
him
before
i
withdraw
with
my
daughter
to
a
hotel
for
the
night
i
looked
up
he
was
standing
in
the
open
doorway
leading
into
the
he
had
recovered
a
semblance
of
composure
but
the
hand
fingering
the
inner
pocket
where
he
kept
his
keys
showed
in
what
a
tumult
of
surprise
and
doubt
he
had
been
thrown
by
this
unaccountable
appearance
of
his
prisoner
in
the
open
hall
and
if
to
other
eyes
he
showed
no
more
than
the
natural
confusion
of
the
moment
to
me
he
had
the
look
of
a
secretly
desperate
man
alive
to
his
danger
and
only
holding
himself
in
check
in
order
to
measure
it
at
the
mention
she
made
of
his
name
he
came
mechanically
forward
and
taking
her
proffered
hand
bowed
over
it
welcome
he
murmured
in
strained
tones
then
startled
by
the
pressure
of
her
fingers
in
his
he
glanced
doubtfully
up
while
she
said
we
will
have
no
talk
my
faithful
and
careful
friend
but
you
may
come
and
see
me
at
the
hotel
you
will
find
that
my
return
will
not
lessen
your
manifest
happiness
then
as
he
began
to
tremble
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
i
heard
her
smilingly
whisper
you
have
too
pretty
a
wife
for
me
not
to
wish
my
return
to
be
a
benefaction
to
her
and
with
a
smile
to
the
crowd
and
an
admonition
to
those
about
her
not
to
let
the
bride
suffer
from
this
interruption
she
disappeared
through
the
great
front
door
on
the
arm
of
the
man
who
for
five
years
had
held
her
prisoner
in
her
own
house
i
went
back
into
the
and
the
five
minutes
which
elapsed
between
that
moment
and
that
of
his
return
were
the
most
awful
of
my
life
when
he
came
back
i
had
aged
ten
years
yet
all
that
time
i
was
laughing
and
talking
he
did
not
rejoin
me
immediately
he
went
i
knew
why
he
had
gone
to
see
if
the
door
to
the
fourth
floor
had
been
unlocked
or
simply
broken
down
when
he
came
back
he
gave
me
one
look
did
he
suspect
me
i
could
not
tell
after
that
there
was
another
blank
in
my
memory
to
the
hour
when
the
guests
were
all
gone
the
house
all
silent
and
we
stood
together
in
a
little
room
where
i
had
at
last
discovered
him
withdrawn
by
himself
writing
there
was
a
loaded
pistol
on
the
table
the
paper
he
had
been
writing
was
his
will
humphrey
said
i
placing
a
finger
on
the
pistol
why
is
this
he
gave
me
a
look
a
hungry
passionate
look
then
he
grew
as
white
as
the
paper
he
had
just
subscribed
with
his
name
i
am
ruined
he
murmured
i
have
made
unwarrantable
use
of
ransome
money
her
return
has
undone
me
delight
i
love
you
but
i
can
not
face
the
future
you
will
be
provided
for
will
i
i
put
in
softly
very
softly
for
my
way
was
strewn
with
pitfalls
and
precipices
i
do
not
think
so
humphrey
if
the
money
you
have
put
away
is
not
yours
my
first
care
would
be
to
restore
it
then
what
would
i
have
left
a
dowry
of
odium
and
despair
and
i
am
scarcely
eighteen
but
but
you
do
not
understand
delight
i
have
been
a
villain
a
worse
villain
than
you
think
the
only
thing
in
my
life
i
have
not
to
blush
for
is
my
love
for
you
this
is
pure
even
if
it
has
been
selfish
i
know
it
is
pure
because
i
have
begun
to
suffer
if
i
could
tell
you
ransome
has
already
told
me
said
i
who
do
you
think
unlocked
the
door
of
her
retreat
i
humphrey
i
wanted
to
save
you
from
yourself
and
she
understands
me
she
will
never
reveal
the
secret
of
the
years
she
has
passed
overhead
would
he
hate
me
would
he
love
me
would
he
turn
that
fatal
weapon
on
me
or
level
it
again
toward
his
own
breast
for
a
moment
i
could
not
tell
then
the
white
horror
in
his
face
broke
up
and
giving
me
a
look
i
shall
never
forget
till
i
die
he
fell
prostrate
on
his
knees
and
lowered
his
proud
head
before
me
i
did
not
touch
it
but
from
that
moment
the
schooling
of
our
two
hearts
began
and
though
i
can
never
look
upon
my
husband
with
the
frank
joy
i
see
in
other
women
faces
i
have
learned
not
to
look
upon
him
with
distrust
and
to
thank
god
i
did
not
forsake
him
when
desertion
might
have
meant
the
destruction
of
the
one
small
seed
of
goodness
which
had
developed
in
his
heart
with
the
advent
of
a
love
for
which
nothing
in
his
whole
previous
life
had
prepared
him
