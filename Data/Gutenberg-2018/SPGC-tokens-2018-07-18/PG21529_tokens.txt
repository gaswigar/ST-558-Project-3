page
talking
to

we
were
called
upon
to
part
with
almost
all
the
gulden
you
need
have
no
hesitation
in
giving
the
boat
to
me
we
both
exclaimed
oh
are
you
here
there
was
a
sudden
stir
in
the
garden
it
black
magic
said
aunt
fay
we
stopped
at
haarlem
only
long
enough
to
do
reverence
to
franz

a
couple
of
great
yellow
dogs
drawing
a
cart
swore
canine
oaths
against
the
car
starr
induced
them
to
stand
for
him
though
they
were
reluctant
and
i
was
glad
to
stoop
down
and
pat

solemn

inspecting
burning
globes
and
bargaining
with
their
possessors

looked
for
all
the

a
beautiful

shone

i
pleased

i
sometimes
i
think
that
having
a
bath
is
the
nicest
part
of
the
day
especially
if
you
take
too
long
over
it
when
you
ought
to
be
hurrying
phyllis
and
i
phil
is
my
stepsister
though
she
is
the
most
english
creature
alive
have
no
proper
in
our
flat
what
can
you
expect
for
forty
pounds
a
year
even
at
clapham
but
we
have
a
arrangement
in
the
and
it
has
never
exploded
yet
phyllis
allows
herself
ten
minutes
for
her
bath
every
morning
just
as
she
allows
herself
five
minutes
for
her
prayers
six
to
do
her
hair
and
four
for
everything
else
except
when
she
wears
boots
but
then
she
has
principles
and
i
have
none
at
least
i
have
no
maxims
and
this
morning
just
because
there
were
lots
of
things
to
do
i
was
luxuriating
in
the
tub
thinking
cool
delicious
thoughts
as
a
general
rule
when
you
paint
glorious
pictures
for
yourself
of
your
future
as
you
would
like
it
to
be
it
clouds
your
existence
with
gray
afterwards
because
the
reality
is
duller
by
contrast
but
it
was
different
this
morning
i
had
stopped
awake
all
night
thinking
the
same
things
and
i
was
no
more
tired
of
the
thoughts
now
than
when
i
first
began
i
lay
with
my
eyes
shut
sniffing
eau
de
cologne
i
poured
in
a
bottleful
for
a
kind
of
libation
because
i
could
afford
to
be
extravagant
and
planning
what
a
delightful
future
we
would
have
i
should
love
to
chop
up
phil
and
burn
the
remains
i
said
to
myself
but
she
much
more
likely
to
put
it
away
in
lavender
or
give
it
to
the
with
the
snub
nose
anyhow
i
shall
never
have
to
write
another
serial
story
for
or
fireside
or
any
of
the
other
horrors
oh
the
joy
of
not
being
forced
to
create
villains
only
to
crush
them
in
the
end
no
more
secret
doors
and
coiners
dens
and
unnaturally
beautiful
assistants
for
me
instead
of
doing
typing
at
ninepence
a
thousand
words
phil
can
embroider
things
for
curates
and
instead
of
peopling
the
world
with
prigs
and
puppets
at
a
guinea
a
thou
i
can
oh
i
can
do
i
do
know
what
i
shall
want
to
do
most
and
that
the
best
of
it
just
to
know
i
do
it
we
have
a
beautiful
house
in
a
nice
part
of
town
a
cottage
by
the
river
and
best
of
all
we
can
travel
travel
travel
then
i
began
to
furnish
the
cottage
and
the
house
and
was
putting
up
a
purple
curtain
in
a
white
marble
with
steps
down
to
the
bath
when
a
knock
came
at
the
door
i
knew
it
was
phil
for
it
could
be
nobody
else
but
it
was
as
unlike
phil
as
possible
as
unlike
her
as
a
mountain
is
unlike
itself
when
it
is
having
an
eruption
nell
she
called
outside
the
door
nell
darling
are
you
ready
only
just
begun
i
answered
i
shall
be
oh
minutes
and
minutes
yet
why
i
do
want
to
worry
you
replied
phil
creamy
voice
with
just
a
little
of
the
cream
skimmed
off
but
do
make
haste
have
you
been
cooking
something
nice
for
breakfast
our
usual
meal
is
quaker
oats
with
milk
and
tea
of
course
phil
would
think
it
sacrilegious
to
begin
the
day
on
any
other
drink
yes
i
have
and
it
have
you
spilt
or
burnt
it
no
but
there
nothing
to
rejoice
over
or
celebrate
after
all
at
least
comparatively
nothing
good
gracious
what
you
mean
i
shrieked
with
my
beginning
to
collapse
while
the
eau
de
cologne
lost
its
savor
in
my
nostrils
has
a
codicil
been
found
to
captain
noble
will
as
in
the
last
number
of
my
serial
for
no
but
the
post
come
with
a
letter
from
his
solicitor
oh
how
stupid
we
were
to
believe
what
keithley
wrote
just
silly
gossip
we
ought
to
have
remembered
that
she
know
and
she
never
got
a
story
straight
anyway
hurry
and
come
out
i
lost
the
soap
now
everything
invariably
goes
wrong
at
once
i
get
hold
of
it
i
shall
probably
be
in
this
bath
all
the
rest
of
my
life
for
goodness
sake
what
does
the
lawyer
man
say
i
ca
stand
here
yelling
such
things
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
then
i
knew
how
dreadfully
poor
phil
was
really
upset
for
her
lovely
voice
was
quite
snappy
and
i
always
thought
she
would
not
snap
on
the
rack
or
in
boiling
oil
as
for
me
my
bath
began
to
feel
like
that
boiling
oil
i
mean
and
i
splashed
about
anyhow
not
caring
whether
i
got
my
hair
wet
or
not
because
if
we
had
to
go
on
being
poor
after
our
great
expectations
nothing
could
possibly
matter
not
even
looking
like
a
drowned
rat
i
had
the
spirit
to
coax
phyllis
but
i
might
have
known
she
go
away
really
when
i
did
answer
except
by
splashes
which
might
have
been
sobs
she
went
on
her
mouth
apparently
at
the
crack
of
the
door
i
suppose
we
ought
to
be
thankful
for
such
mercies
as
been
granted
but
after
what
we
been
led
to
expect
what
mercies
as
a
matter
of
fact
remain
to
us
i
asked
trying
to
restore
depressed
spirits
as
well
as
circulation
with
a
towel
as
harsh
as
fate
two
hundred
pounds
and
a
a
for
goodness
yes
the
pounds
are
for
me
the
boat
for
you
it
seems
you
once
unfortunately
wrote
a
postcard
and
told
poor
dear
captain
noble
you
envied
him
having
it
it
said
to
be
as
good
as
new
so
there
one
comfort
you
can
sell
it
and
perhaps
get
as
much
money
as
he
has
left
me
i
came
very
near
falling
down
again
in
the
bath
with
an
awful
splash
beneath
the
crushing
weight
of
disappointment
and
the
soap
slipping
under
my
foot
two
hundred
pounds
and
a
instead
of
all
those
thousands
i
groaned
not
very
loudly
but
phil
heard
me
through
the
door
never
mind
dearest
she
called
striving
in
that
irritating
way
saints
have
to
be
cheerful
in
spite
of
all
it
better
than
nothing
we
can
invest
it
invest
it
i
screamed
what
are
two
hundred
pounds
and
a
when
invested
evidently
she
was
doing
a
sum
in
mental
arithmetic
after
a
few
silence
she
answered
bravely
about
twelve
pounds
a
year
twelve
pounds
a
year
i
shrieked
then
something
odd
seemed
to
happen
in
my
inner
workings
my
blood
gave
a
jump
and
flew
up
to
my
head
where
i
could
hear
it
singing
a
wild
excited
song
perhaps
it
was
the
eau
de
cologne
and
not
being
used
to
it
in
my
bath
which
made
me
feel
like
that
i
invest
my
i
said
i
going
a
cruise
in
it
and
so
are
you
my
darling
girl
i
hope
you
have
gone
out
of
your
mind
from
the
blow
there
was
alarm
and
solicitude
in
phil
accents
when
slipped
on
your
and
come
out
we
talk
things
over
nothing
can
make
me
change
my
mind
i
answered
it
been
made
up
a
whole
minute
everything
is
clear
now
providence
has
put
a
into
our
hands
as
a
means
of
seeing
life
and
to
console
us
for
not
being
captain
noble
heiresses
as
keithley
wrote
we
were
going
to
be
i
will
fly
in
providence
face
i
have
been
brought
up
to
it
by
you
we
are
going
to
have
the
time
of
our
lives
with
that
the
door
shook
with
phil
disapproval
you
talk
like
an
american
she
flung
at
me
through
the
panel
that
good
i
glad
adoption
has
ruined
me
i
retorted
but
could
just
because
you
english
contentedly
give
up
our
beautiful
plans
and
settle
down
as
if
nothing
had
happened
with
your
i
hope
i
have
the
strength
of
mind
to
bear
it
faltered
phyllis
we
only
had
two
days
of
hoping
for
better
things
we
only
for
two
days
there
no
going
back
there
ca
be
we
burned
our
ships
behind
us
and
must
take
to
the
dearest
i
do
think
this
is
a
proper
time
for
joking
and
you
in
your
bath
too
protested
phil
mildly
i
out
of
it
now
but
i
refuse
to
be
out
of
everything
miss
phyllis
rivers
why
your
very
name
a
prophecy
i
formally
invite
you
to
take
a
trip
with
me
in
my
it
may
cost
us
half
if
not
more
of
your
part
of
the
legacy
but
i
will
merely
borrow
from
you
the
wherewithal
to
pay
our
expenses
somehow
afterwards
i
pay
it
back
even
if
i
have
to
reëstablish
communication
with
heavenly
and
villainous
duchesses
oh
phil
we
get
some
fun
out
of
this
after
all
anyhow
we
shall
go
on
for
a
few
weeks
what
matter
if
after
that
the
deluge
you
speak
exactly
as
if
you
were
planning
to
be
an
said
phyllis
coldly
i
should
love
to
be
one
said
i
i
always
thought
it
must
be
more
fun
than
anything
till
the
last
chapter
we
both
embark
in
the
on
a
brief
but
bright
career
as
adventuresses
with
that
before
she
could
give
me
an
answer
i
opened
the
door
and
walked
out
in
my
so
suddenly
that
she
almost
pitched
forward
into
the
bath
phyllis
heard
from
behind
a
cold
unsympathetic
door
and
phyllis
seen
in
all
her
virginal
attractiveness
might
as
well
be
two
different
girls
if
you
carried
on
a
conversation
with
miss
rivers
on
ethics
and
conventionalities
and
curates
and
things
of
that
kind
from
behind
a
door
without
having
first
peeped
round
to
see
what
she
was
like
you
would
do
the
real
phil
an
injustice
there
is
nothing
pink
and
soft
and
dimpled
about
phyllis
views
of
life
or
at
least
what
she
supposes
her
views
to
be
but
about
phyllis
in
flesh
and
blood
there
is
more
of
that
than
anything
else
which
is
one
reason
why
she
has
been
a
constant
fountain
of
joy
to
my
heart
as
well
as
my
sense
of
humor
ever
since
her
clever
herefordshire
father
married
my
pretty
kentucky
mother
phil
would
like
if
published
to
be
a
book
and
a
volume
of
good
form
for
high
society
rolled
into
one
but
she
is
really
more
like
a
treatise
on
and
a
recipe
for
making
devonshire
junket
with
clotted
cream
not
that
she
a
regular
beauty
or
that
she
goes
in
for
any
speciality
by
way
of
features
or
eyelashes
or
hair
or
a
figure
or
anything
really
sensational
of
that
sort
as
i
do
in
one
or
two
directions
but
there
a
rose
and
pearl
and
adorableness
about
her
you
like
her
all
the
better
for
some
little
puritanical
quaintnesses
and
if
you
are
an
englishman
or
an
american
girl
you
long
to
bully
her
she
is
taller
than
i
am
as
she
ought
to
be
with
nose
and
eyes
but
this
morning
when
i
sprang
at
her
out
of
the
like
a
young
tigress
escaped
from
its
cage
on
its
ruthless
way
to
a
she
looked
so
piteous
and
yielding
that
i
felt
i
could
carry
her
and
my
point
at
the
same
time
half
across
the
world
she
had
made
cream
eggs
for
breakfast
poor
darling
i
could
have
sobbed
on
them
and
actually
coffee
for
me
because
she
knows
i
love
it
i
did
worry
her
any
more
until
an
egg
and
a
cup
of
tea
were
on
duty
to
keep
her
strength
up
and
then
i
poured
plans
which
i
made
as
i
went
on
upon
her
meekly
protesting
head
the
boat
it
appeared
lay
in
holland
which
fact
as
i
pointed
out
to
phil
was
another
sign
that
providence
had
set
its
heart
upon
our
using
her
for
we
always
wanted
to
see
holland
we
often
said
if
we
ever
took
a
holiday
from
serials
and
the
we
would
go
to
holland
but
somehow
the
time
for
holidays
and
holland
never
seemed
to
arrive
now
here
it
was
and
it
would
be
time
of
our
lives
poor
captain
noble
meant
to
use
the
boat
himself
this
summer
but
he
was
taken
ill
late
in
the
season
on
the
riviera
and
died
there
it
was
from
mentone
that
keithley
wrote
what
was
being
said
among
his
friends
about
a
huge
legacy
for
us
and
we
poor
deluded
ones
had
believed
captain
noble
a
dear
old
retired
naval
officer
was
a
friend
of
phyllis
father
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
though
phil
was
sixteen
and
i
fifteen
when
our
respective
parents
widowed
both
ages
before
met
and
married
the
good
man
took
my
mother
also
to
his
heart
phil
and
i
have
been
alone
in
the
world
together
now
for
three
years
she
is
i
though
many
moons
have
passed
since
we
saw
anything
of
captain
noble
except
picture
postcards
we
were
not
taken
entirely
by
surprise
when
we
heard
that
he
had
left
us
a
large
legacy
it
is
easy
to
get
used
to
nice
things
and
far
more
difficult
to
crawl
down
gracefully
from
gilded
heights
crawl
we
must
however
so
i
determined
it
should
be
into
that
floating
idly
on
a
canal
in
holland
the
letter
from
the
solicitor
a
french
solicitor
or
the
equivalent
writing
from
the
riviera
told
us
all
about
the
boat
and
about
the
money
the
boat
must
be
got
by
going
or
sending
to
rotterdam
the
money
obtained
in
london
a
thirty
why
not
thirty
sounds
very
grand
to
read
about
and
as
i
recovered
from
my
first
disappointment
i
began
to
feel
as
if
i
suddenly
become
proprietor
of
a
whole
circus
full
of
champing
steeds
i
tried
to
persuade
phyllis
that
i
should
write
better
stories
if
i
could
travel
a
little
in
my
own
as
it
would
broaden
my
mind
therefore
it
would
pay
in
the
end
besides
i
was
sure
my
health
was
not
breaking
down
from
overstrain
not
only
that
i
felt
it
would
be
to
go
and
anyhow
i
just
would
go
so
there
i
argued
till
i
was
on
the
point
of
fainting
or
having
a
fit
and
no
doubt
that
it
was
my
drawn
face
what
face
would
have
been
drawn
to
which
phil
soft
heart
and
obstinate
mind
finally
succumbed
she
said
that
as
i
seemed
determined
to
go
through
fire
and
water
i
never
heard
of
any
hot
springs
in
the
canals
of
holland
she
supposed
she
would
have
to
stick
by
me
for
she
was
older
than
i
and
allow
me
to
go
alone
under
any
consideration
especially
with
my
coloring
and
hair
but
though
experience
of
me
had
accustomed
her
to
shocks
and
she
must
confess
to
sacrifices
she
had
never
expected
until
now
that
she
would
be
called
upon
for
my
sake
to
become
an
adventuress
as
for
the
two
hundred
pounds
that
part
did
signify
i
suppose
she
was
thinking
of
it
thank
heaven
whether
we
worked
or
were
idle
we
would
still
have
our
settled
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
each
it
was
our
reputation
for
which
she
cared
most
and
she
was
sure
the
evil
that
could
befall
us
would
be
to
blow
up
better
do
it
on
a
grand
scale
in
a
thirty
than
in
a
of
a
flat
in
clapham
i
remarked
and
somehow
that
silenced
phyllis
except
for
a
sigh
since
then
i
been
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
preparing
my
watery
path
as
a
adventuress
and
buying
a
dress
or
two
to
suit
the
part
it
does
even
depress
me
that
phil
has
selected
hers
with
the
air
of
acquiring
a
serviceable
shroud
i
finished
up
three
serials
in
as
many
days
killing
off
my
villains
like
flies
and
creating
a
perfect
epidemic
of
hastily
made
matches
among
titled
heroes
and
virtuous
nursery
governesses
scarcely
an
aristocratic
house
in
england
that
would
shake
to
its
foundations
if
fiction
were
fact
but
then
my
fiction
is
of
the
kind
that
anything
short
of
a
dislocated
universe
could
possibly
make
fact
phyllis
with
the
face
of
a
tragic
muse
has
been
writing
letters
to
her
clients
recommending
another
typist
quite
a
professional
sort
of
person
who
was
her
understudy
once
a
year
or
so
ago
when
she
thoughtlessly
allowed
herself
to
come
down
with
measles
miss
brown
never
puts
instead
of
or
gets
chapter
titles
on
one
side
and
she
knows
how
to
make
the
curlicues
under
her
headings
nobody
will
ever
want
me
to
come
back
the
poor
girl
wailed
all
the
better
for
them
if
you
going
to
blow
up
as
you
are
convinced
you
will
i
strove
to
console
her
as
i
tried
on
a
reduced
to
two
from
four
shillings
but
she
merely
shuddered
and
now
when
at
last
we
have
shut
up
the
flat
turned
the
key
upon
our
pasts
and
got
irrevocably
on
board
the
batavier
boat
which
will
land
us
in
rotterdam
she
has
moaned
more
than
once
i
feel
as
if
nothing
would
be
the
same
with
us
ever
ever
again
so
do
i
i
answered
unfeelingly
and
i
ii
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
on
a
ship
since
i
crossed
from
america
with
my
mother
neither
of
us
dreaming
that
she
would
settle
down
and
give
me
an
englishman
for
a
stepfather
as
for
phil
she
has
no
memories
outside
her
native
land
except
early
ones
of
paris
and
though
she
has
a
natural
instinct
for
the
preservation
of
her
young
life
i
do
doubt
that
every
motion
of
the
big
boat
in
the
night
made
her
realize
how
infinitely
more
decorous
it
would
be
to
drown
on
the
batavier
than
in
a
newfangled
motor
thing
on
an
obscure
foreign
canal
the
thames
we
have
seen
before
in
all
its
bigness
and
richness
and
black
ugliness
for
on
hot
summer
days
we
have
embarked
on
certain
trips
which
would
condemn
us
forever
in
the
eyes
of
duchesses
countesses
and
other
ladies
of
title
i
have
known
serially
in
instalments
but
we
or
rather
i
chose
to
reach
holland
by
water
as
it
seems
a
more
appropriate
preface
to
our
adventure
and
i
got
phyllis
up
before
five
in
the
morning
not
to
miss
by
any
chance
the
first
sight
of
the
low
lands
we
were
only
just
in
time
for
we
had
had
our
coffee
and
been
dressed
many
minutes
before
my
eyes
caught
at
a
line
of
land
as
a
drowning
person
is
supposed
to
catch
at
a
straw
holland
said
i
which
was
not
particularly
intelligent
in
me
as
it
could
have
been
anything
else
there
it
lay
this
stage
set
for
our
drama
comedy
tragedy
whatever
it
may
prove
of
which
we
do
yet
know
the
plot
although
we
are
the
heroines
and
now
that
i
writing
in
a
rotterdam
hotel
the
curtain
may
be
said
to
have
rung
up
on
the
first
act
just
then
it
was
lifted
only
far
enough
to
show
a
long
low
waste
of
with
a
tuft
or
two
of
trees
and
a
few
shadowy
individuals
which
the
had
evidently
set
in
motion
for
the
benefit
of
the
leading
ladies
we
might
be
the
two
orphans
i
said
only
you
not
blind
phil
except
in
your
sense
of
humor
and
i
afraid
there
are
no
wicked
dutch
noblemen
to
kidnap
me
oh
dear
i
sure
i
hope
not
exclaimed
phil
looking
as
if
a
new
feather
had
been
heaped
on
her
load
of
anxieties
the
line
was
no
longer
gray
now
nor
was
it
a
waste
it
was
a
bright
green
floating
ribbon
brocaded
with
red
flowers
and
soon
it
was
no
ribbon
but
a
stretch
of
grassy
meadow
and
the
red
flowers
were
roofs
yet
meadows
and
roofs
were
not
just
common
meadows
and
roofs
for
they
belonged
to
holland
and
everybody
knows
even
those
who
have
seen
it
yet
that
holland
is
like
no
country
in
the
world
except
its
queer
cozy
courageous
obstinate
little
self
the
sky
was
blue
to
welcome
us
and
housewifely
dutch
angels
were
beating
up
the
fat
white
before
tucking
them
under
the
horizon
out
of
sight
even
the
air
seemed
to
have
been
washed
till
it
glittered
with
crystalline
clearness
that
brought
each
feature
of
the
landscape
strangely
close
to
the
eyes
we
were
in
the
river
maas
which
opened
its
laughing
mouth
wide
to
let
in
our
boat
but
soon
it
was
so
busy
with
its
daily
toil
that
it
forgot
to
smile
and
look
its
best
for
strangers
we
saw
it
in
its
brown
giving
water
to
ugly
manufactories
and
floating
an
army
of
big
ships
black
lighters
and
broadly
built
craft
which
coughed
spasmodically
as
they
forged
sturdily
and
swiftly
through
the
waters
their
breath
was
like
the
whiff
that
comes
from
an
automobile
and
i
knew
that
they
must
be
my
heart
warmed
to
them
they
seemed
to
have
been
sent
out
on
purpose
to
say
your
fun
is
going
to
begin
at
last
we
were
in
rotterdam
steaming
slowly
between
two
lines
of
dignified
quays
ornamented
with
rows
of
trees
and
backed
by
quaintly
built
brick
houses
blue
and
green
and
pink
some
nodding
forward
some
leaning
back
the
front
walls
were
carried
up
to
conceal
the
roofs
many
of
the
façades
tapered
into
triangles
others
had
double
curves
like
a
swan
neck
some
were
cut
into
steps
so
that
there
was
great
variety
and
an
effect
almost
chinese
about
the
architecture
of
the
queer
houses
with
the
cranes
projecting
over
their
topmost
windows
there
was
nothing
to
be
called
beautiful
but
it
was
all
impressive
and
interesting
because
so
different
from
that
part
of
the
world
which
we
know
a
gigantic
railway
bridge
of
latticed
iron
flung
itself
across
the
skyline
one
huge
white
building
like
a
new
york
towered
head
and
shoulders
above
the
roofs
of
the
city
and
all
among
the
houses
were
brown
sails
and
masts
of
ships
and
tangled
inseparably
together
the
hum
of
life
strange
foreign
life
filled
the
air
an
indescribable
exciting
sound
made
up
of
the
wind
whistling
among
cordage
of
ships
the
shouts
of
men
at
work
the
river
slapping
against
piles
and
the
iron
sides
of
vessels
the
whirr
and
clank
of
wreaths
of
brown
smoke
blew
gustily
in
the
sunlight
a
train
boomed
across
the
latticed
bridge
and
the
hoot
of
a
siren
tore
all
other
sounds
in
shreds
creakily
our
ship
was
warped
in
by
straining
cables
and
i
said
to
myself
the
overture
finished
the
play
is
going
to
begin
phil
and
i
streamed
off
the
boat
with
the
other
passengers
who
had
the
air
of
knowing
exactly
why
they
come
where
they
were
going
and
what
was
the
proper
thing
to
do
next
but
as
soon
as
we
were
landed
on
the
most
extraordinary
place
which
looked
as
if
trees
and
houses
had
sprouted
on
a
dyke
all
consecutive
ideas
were
ground
out
of
our
heads
in
the
mill
of
confusing
sights
and
sounds
friends
were
meeting
each
other
and
jabbering
something
which
sounded
at
a
distance
like
and
like
no
known
language
when
you
were
close
enough
to
catch
the
words
porters
surged
round
us
urging
the
claims
of
rival
hotels
men
in
indigo
cotton
blouses
pleaded
for
our
luggage
and
altogether
we
were
overwhelmed
by
a
tidal
wave
of
dutchness
how
order
finally
came
out
of
chaos
i
hardly
know
but
when
i
got
my
breath
it
occurred
to
me
that
we
might
temporarily
abandon
our
big
luggage
and
steer
through
the
crowd
with
in
our
hands
to
hail
an
elderly
cab
whose
driver
had
early
selected
us
as
prey
before
getting
into
the
vehicle
i
paused
and
tried
to
concentrate
my
mind
on
plans
though
the
quaint
picture
of
the
boompjes
and
the
thought
that
phyllis
rivers
and
nell
van
buren
should
be
on
the
boompjes
was
distracting
i
did
manage
however
to
find
our
address
and
the
name
of
the
caretaker
both
of
which
i
had
on
a
piece
of
paper
with
loose
i
and
j
scattered
thickly
through
every
word
all
we
had
to
do
therefore
was
to
tell
our
cabman
to
drive
to
the
place
show
the
letters
from
the
solicitor
and
perhaps
a
copy
of
captain
noble
will
claim
our
property
from
the
hands
of
jan
paasma
and
then
if
we
liked
take
up
our
quarters
on
our
own
boat
until
we
could
engage
some
one
to
work
it
for
our
tour
luckily
we
had
coffee
and
rolls
on
board
the
batavier
so
we
need
bother
about
breakfast
as
i
said
joyously
to
phil
but
phil
it
seemed
did
not
regard
breakfast
as
a
bother
she
thought
it
would
be
fatal
to
throw
ourselves
into
a
formidable
undertaking
unless
we
first
had
tea
and
an
egg
and
somebody
to
advise
us
we
must
go
to
an
hotel
before
we
see
the
boat
said
she
firmly
but
who
to
give
us
advice
at
a
hotel
i
asked
with
scorn
oh
i
do
know
the
manager
managers
of
hotels
are
engaged
to
advise
young
women
about
well
then
a
a
waiter
a
we
could
ask
the
head
one
and
anyway
he
would
be
a
my
darling
child
have
we
ever
depended
on
a
man
since
your
father
died
we
never
had
emergencies
except
taking
our
flat
oh
and
buying
my
besides
i
ca
bear
all
i
shall
have
to
bear
without
a
cup
of
tea
this
settled
it
we
climbed
into
that
frail
shell
our
chosen
cab
and
i
opened
the
dutch
which
i
bought
in
london
i
wanted
to
find
out
what
hotel
was
nearest
to
the
lair
of
our
boat
but
in
that
wild
moment
i
could
discover
nothing
more
appropriate
than
i
wish
immediately
some
medicine
for
seasickness
and
hastily
turning
over
the
pages
i
have
lost
my
pet
cat
i
began
mechanically
to
stammer
french
and
the
few
words
of
german
which
for
years
have
lain
peacefully
buried
in
the
dustiest
folds
of
my
intellect
oh
dear
how
i
make
him
understand
what
we
want
i
groaned
my
nerves
quivering
under
the
pitying
eye
of
the
cabman
and
the
expression
of
phyllis
do
ask
said
she
in
icy
vengefulness
you
bring
me
to
holland
and
i
should
speak
dutch
if
i
could
i
spik
eengleesh
announced
the
cabman
i
could
have
fallen
upon
his
bosom
which
though
littered
with
dust
and
i
was
sure
concealed
a
noble
heart
but
i
contented
myself
with
taking
him
into
my
confidence
i
said
we
had
a
and
wanted
to
go
to
a
hotel
as
near
it
as
possible
i
then
showed
the
precious
paper
with
the
i
and
j
dotted
about
and
he
nodded
so
much
that
his
tall
hat
which
looked
like
a
bit
cut
out
of
a
rusty
almost
fell
off
on
my
nose
you
get
on
my
carriage
and
i
drive
you
to
where
you
want
he
replied
reassuringly
making
of
our
luggage
a
for
his
honest
boots
and
climbing
into
his
seat
magnetized
by
his
manner
we
obeyed
and
it
was
not
until
we
had
started
rattling
over
the
street
that
phil
bethought
herself
of
an
important
detail
wait
a
moment
ask
him
if
it
a
nice
hotel
where
he
taking
us
i
stood
up
seized
the
railing
of
the
driver
seat
to
steady
myself
and
shrieked
the
question
above
the
noise
of
the
wheels
i
take
you
right
place
he
returned
and
i
repeated
the
sentence
to
phyllis
that
no
answer
ask
him
if
it
respectable
we
ca
go
if
it
is
ask
him
if
it
expensive
we
ca
go
if
it
is
i
yelled
the
message
i
take
you
hotel
you
see
rotterdam
a
little
first
but
we
do
want
to
see
rotterdam
first
we
want
breakfast
rotterdam
a
sudden
bump
flung
me
down
onto
the
hard
seat
i
half
rose
to
do
battle
again
then
as
i
gazed
up
at
that
implacable
dutch
back
i
began
dimly
to
understand
how
holland
though
a
dot
of
a
nation
tired
out
and
defeated
fiery
spain
i
knew
that
no
good
would
be
accomplished
by
resisting
that
back
short
of
hurling
ourselves
out
on
the
stones
we
would
have
to
see
rotterdam
so
we
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
and
this
i
urged
upon
phil
with
reproaches
for
her
niggardliness
in
not
buying
baedeker
who
would
have
put
stars
to
tell
us
the
names
of
hotels
and
given
us
crisp
maps
to
show
where
they
were
situated
in
connection
with
other
things
i
should
think
few
people
who
have
lived
in
rotterdam
for
years
have
really
seen
as
much
of
the
town
as
we
saw
on
this
clear
blue
morning
at
first
the
information
bestowed
upon
us
by
the
owner
of
the
back
seemed
an
adding
of
insult
to
injury
how
dared
he
explain
what
he
was
forcing
us
to
see
in
spite
of
ourselves
but
even
phyllis
fell
to
laughing
and
her
dimples
are
to
her
temper
what
rainbows
are
to
once
they
are
out
there
can
be
no
more
storm
i
feel
as
if
we
seen
samples
of
all
holland
and
were
ready
to
go
to
our
peaceful
home
again
said
phil
after
we
driven
about
from
the
region
of
big
shops
and
imposing
arcades
to
shady
streets
mirroring
brown
mansions
in
glassy
canals
on
to
toy
villages
of
miniature
painted
houses
standing
in
flowery
gardens
far
below
the
level
of
adjacent
ponds
adorned
with
through
large
parks
and
intricate
plantations
past
solemnly
flapping
windmills
far
beyond
to
meadows
where
black
and
white
cows
recognized
the
fact
that
we
were
not
dutch
and
despised
us
for
it
then
back
to
parks
and
gardens
again
i
should
think
there
could
be
any
sort
of
characteristic
thing
left
which
we
have
met
with
i
sure
i
could
go
home
now
and
talk
intelligently
about
holland
we
could
help
being
interested
in
everything
though
we
were
seeing
it
against
our
wills
yet
it
was
a
relief
to
our
feelings
when
the
back
unbent
to
the
extent
of
stopping
before
an
hotel
close
to
a
park
so
far
as
we
could
judge
it
was
miles
from
anywhere
and
had
no
connection
with
anything
else
but
we
were
too
thankful
for
the
privilege
of
stopping
to
be
critical
the
house
had
an
air
of
quiet
rectitude
which
appealed
to
phil
and
without
a
word
she
allowed
our
luggage
to
be
taken
off
the
cab
when
we
came
to
pay
it
appeared
that
our
driver
had
made
us
acquainted
with
every
secret
of
rotterdam
purely
in
a
spirit
of
generosity
we
were
called
upon
to
part
with
almost
all
the
gulden
we
had
got
in
exchange
for
shillings
on
board
the
boat
and
phil
looked
volumes
as
it
dawned
on
her
intelligence
that
each
one
of
these
coins
with
the
head
of
an
incredibly
mild
and
whiskered
old
gentleman
upon
it
was
worth
one
and
eightpence
illustration
were
called
upon
to
part
with
almost
all
the
at
this
rate
we
shall
soon
be
in
the
poorhouse
she
said
if
it
comes
to
that
we
can
stop
the
at
villages
and
solicit
alms
i
suggested
after
all
the
back
had
had
some
method
in
its
madness
for
on
showing
the
caretaker
address
to
a
giant
it
appeared
that
the
place
was
within
ten
minutes
walk
of
the
hotel
we
refused
to
decide
upon
rooms
until
our
future
plans
had
shaped
themselves
and
our
luggage
reposed
in
the
hall
while
we
had
cups
of
tea
and
a
dutch
conception
of
toast
in
a
garden
whose
charms
we
shared
with
a
rakish
wandering
jew
of
a
tortoise
many
times
since
i
induced
phyllis
to
join
me
in
becoming
an
adventuress
have
we
vaguely
arranged
what
we
would
do
on
arriving
at
rotterdam
the
program
seemed
simple
enough
from
a
distance
just
to
go
and
pick
up
our
boat
so
to
speak
and
motor
away
with
it
but
when
we
actually
started
off
pioneered
by
a
small
boy
from
the
hotel
to
take
possession
of
our
property
i
had
a
horrid
sinking
of
the
heart
which
i
would
for
many
heads
of
whiskered
old
gentlemen
on
gulden
have
confessed
to
phil
i
felt
that
something
was
going
to
happen
the
ten
minutes
walk
prolonged
itself
into
twenty
and
then
there
was
a
ferry
over
a
wide
brown
stream
this
brought
us
to
a
little
basin
opening
from
the
river
where
one
or
two
small
yachts
and
other
craft
nestled
together
look
i
exclaimed
with
a
sudden
throb
of
excitement
which
bubbled
up
like
a
geyser
through
the
cold
crust
of
my
depression
she
is
who
cried
phyllis
starting
any
one
we
know
our
boat
silly
i
suppose
you
think
she
ought
to
be
called
elephant
yes
there
she
was
with
lorelei
in
gold
letters
on
her
bows
this
fair
siren
who
had
lured
us
across
the
north
sea
and
instead
of
being
covered
up
and
shabby
to
look
at
after
her
long
winter
of
retirement
and
neglect
she
had
the
air
of
being
ready
to
start
off
at
a
notice
to
begin
a
cruise
every
detail
of
her
smart
white
dress
looked
new
there
was
no
fear
of
delay
for
painting
and
patching
clean
matting
was
spread
upon
the
floor
of
the
little
decks
fore
and
aft
the
brass
rails
dazzled
our
eyes
with
their
brilliance
the
windows
of
the
roofed
cabin
were
brighter
than
the
the
day
i
went
to
see
it
in
the
tower
of
london
with
pink
and
blue
and
primrose
silk
cushions
stood
on
deck
their
arms
open
in
a
welcoming
gesture
there
was
a
little
table
too
which
looked
born
and
bred
for
a
it
really
was
extraordinary
oh
nell
it
is
a
boat
the
words
were
torn
from
phil
in
reluctant
admiration
of
course
it
most
awfully
reckless
of
us
to
have
come
and
i
do
see
what
going
to
happen
in
the
end
but
but
it
seem
as
if
we
might
enjoy
ourselves
fancy
having
tea
on
our
own
deck
why
it
almost
a
yacht
i
wonder
what
lady
hutchinson
would
say
if
she
could
see
us
sitting
in
those
chairs
she
be
polite
to
me
for
a
whole
month
lady
hutchinson
is
phil
one
titled
client
long
ago
her
husband
was
a
grocer
she
writes
sentimental
poetry
and
her
idea
of
dignity
is
to
snub
her
but
i
could
concentrate
my
mind
on
the
pleasure
of
astonishing
lady
hutchinson
i
was
thinking
what
a
wonderful
caretaker
jan
paasma
must
be
conscientious
hardly
expressed
him
because
it
almost
a
year
since
captain
noble
used
lorelei
and
we
had
written
that
we
were
coming
to
claim
her
yet
here
she
was
for
our
reception
but
then
i
thought
perhaps
our
dear
old
friend
had
left
instructions
to
keep
the
boat
always
ready
it
would
be
rather
like
him
and
in
any
case
we
should
soon
know
all
as
paasma
dwelling
is
a
little
green
house
close
to
the
miniature
quay
we
saw
his
name
over
the
door
for
evidently
he
does
entirely
depend
upon
his
guardianship
of
boats
for
a
livelihood
he
owns
a
shop
with
indescribable
things
in
the
one
cramped
but
shining
window
things
which
only
those
who
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
could
possibly
wish
to
have
for
all
we
could
tell
he
might
be
on
board
the
boat
which
floated
a
yard
or
two
from
shore
moored
by
ropes
but
it
seemed
more
professional
to
seek
paasma
under
his
own
roof
and
we
did
so
nearly
falling
over
a
stout
child
who
was
scrubbing
the
floor
of
the
shop
what
a
queer
time
of
day
to
be
cleaning
eleven
muttered
phil
having
just
saved
herself
from
a
tumble
i
thought
so
too
but
then
we
been
in
holland
only
a
few
hours
we
had
yet
realized
the
relative
importance
of
certain
affairs
of
life
according
to
a
dutchwoman
point
of
view
we
glared
reproachfully
at
the
stout
child
as
much
as
to
say
why
you
finish
your
swabbing
at
a
proper
hour
she
glared
at
us
as
if
she
would
have
demanded
what
the
dutch
dickens
do
you
mean
by
bouncing
in
and
upsetting
my
arrangements
little
was
accomplished
on
either
side
by
this
skirmishing
so
i
put
my
pride
in
my
pocket
and
inquired
for
her
master
boot
replied
the
creature
boot
pointing
with
her
mop
in
the
direction
whence
we
had
come
we
understood
by
this
that
the
caretaker
was
at
his
post
and
we
returned
to
shout
the
name
of
heer
paasma
nothing
happened
at
first
but
after
several
spasmodic
repetitions
a
blue
silk
curtain
flickered
at
one
of
the
cabin
windows
on
lorelei
and
a
little
old
brown
face
with
a
fringe
of
fluff
round
the
chin
appeared
in
the
aperture
a
walnut
of
a
face
with
a
pair
of
shrewd
twinkling
eyes
and
a
pipe
in
a
slit
of
a
mouth
another
call
brought
on
deck
a
figure
which
matched
the
face
and
on
deck
paasma
it
looked
like
a
gnome
but
it
could
be
no
other
than
the
caretaker
evidently
intended
to
remain
until
he
got
a
satisfactory
explanation
iii
are
you
heer
paasma
i
inquired
from
my
distance
the
walnut
nodded
do
you
speak
english
out
came
the
pipe
ja
a
leetle
we
miss
rivers
and
miss
van
buren
from
england
i
miss
van
buren
you
have
heard
about
me
and
that
captain
noble
left
me
his
in
his
will
no
i
not
heerd
a
dark
flush
slowly
turned
the
sharp
little
walnut
face
to
mahogany
how
strange
i
thought
the
solicitor
would
have
written
but
perhaps
it
was
necessary
anyway
i
have
all
the
papers
to
prove
that
the
boat
is
mine
you
did
know
poor
captain
noble
was
dead
surely
ja
i
hear
that
well
if
you
put
a
plank
across
we
come
on
board
and
i
show
you
my
papers
and
explain
everything
i
come
on
shore
said
paasma
no
we
would
rather
i
might
have
saved
my
breath
paasma
was
dutch
and
he
had
made
up
his
mind
what
would
be
best
the
rest
goes
without
saying
he
seized
one
of
the
ropes
hauled
the
boat
closer
to
shore
and
sprang
onto
the
bank
there
was
a
strange
glitter
in
his
eye
i
supposed
it
to
be
the
bleak
glint
of
suspicion
and
hastened
to
reassure
the
excellent
man
by
producing
my
papers
pointing
out
paragraphs
which
i
placed
conspicuously
under
his
nose
in
our
copy
of
captain
noble
will
and
the
letters
i
had
received
from
the
solicitor
you
see
i
said
at
last
everything
is
all
right
you
need
have
no
hesitation
in
giving
the
boat
to
me
illustration
you
need
have
no
hesitation
in
giving
the
boat
to
me
paasma
puffed
at
his
pipe
which
he
held
very
tight
between
his
teeth
and
stared
at
the
papers
without
looking
up
if
you
like
you
can
apply
to
your
lawyer
if
you
have
one
i
went
on
seeing
that
he
was
far
from
easy
in
his
mind
i
quite
willing
to
meet
him
besides
i
had
suddenly
a
brilliant
idea
i
have
relations
in
rotterdam
their
name
is
the
same
as
mine
van
buren
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
heer
robert
van
buren
ja
replied
paasma
biting
his
pipe
still
harder
instead
of
looking
happy
his
face
grew
so
troubled
that
i
wondered
whether
my
mention
of
these
unknown
relatives
had
been
unfortunate
whether
by
any
chance
a
member
of
the
family
had
lately
committed
some
crime
meanwhile
phyllis
stared
for
my
own
reasons
i
had
refrained
from
speaking
to
her
of
these
relations
now
urged
by
necessity
i
brought
them
to
light
but
what
they
might
be
or
whether
they
still
existed
in
rotterdam
i
knew
no
more
than
did
phil
mynheer
van
buren
is
a
known
man
said
the
caretaker
you
not
send
for
him
i
think
the
boat
is
to
you
missus
what
you
want
do
first
of
all
we
want
to
go
on
board
and
look
at
her
i
replied
this
time
rather
to
my
surprise
he
made
no
objections
a
dark
pall
of
resignation
had
fallen
upon
him
in
such
a
mood
as
his
an
indian
woman
would
go
to
suttee
without
a
qualm
he
pulled
the
boat
to
shore
placed
a
plank
and
with
a
thrilling
pride
of
possession
we
walked
on
board
there
were
some
steep
steps
which
led
down
from
the
deck
to
the
cabin
and
phyllis
and
i
descended
paasma
stolidly
following
with
an
extraordinary
expression
on
his
walnut
face
it
was
not
exactly
despairing
or
defiant
or
angry
or
puzzled
but
it
held
something
of
each
one
of
these
emotions
however
i
soon
forgot
about
the
caretaker
and
his
feelings
in
admiration
of
lorelei
aft
you
looked
down
into
the
with
a
big
monster
of
machinery
which
i
respected
but
did
understand
from
that
when
you
crossed
a
little
passage
you
had
to
go
down
some
more
steps
into
a
cabin
which
was
so
charming
that
i
stood
still
on
the
threshold
and
said
oh
why
it
prettier
than
our
exclaimed
phil
and
my
favorite
colors
too
green
and
white
it
almost
like
a
boudoir
who
could
have
supposed
captain
noble
would
have
so
much
taste
and
do
look
at
that
darling
old
dutch
clock
over
the
the
buffet
or
whatever
it
is
with
all
the
little
ships
rocking
on
the
waves
every
time
it
ticks
we
were
both
so
much
excited
now
that
we
began
to
talk
together
neither
of
us
listening
to
the
other
we
opened
the
door
of
what
phil
called
the
buffet
and
found
neat
little
piles
of
china
there
were
tiny
tablecloths
and
napkins
too
and
knives
and
forks
and
spoons
on
one
of
the
seats
which
could
be
turned
into
berths
at
night
stood
a
smart
we
peeped
inside
and
it
was
the
nicest
imaginable
which
must
have
come
from
some
grand
shop
in
bond
street
with
its
gold
and
white
cups
and
its
gleaming
nickel
and
silver
in
the
locker
were
sheets
and
blankets
on
a
bracket
by
the
clock
was
a
with
glass
doors
and
novels
inside
how
pathetic
it
is
i
cried
poor
captain
noble
he
must
have
enjoyed
getting
together
these
nice
things
and
now
they
are
all
for
and
here
this
is
sad
his
poor
dear
shirts
and
things
sighed
phil
making
further
discoveries
in
another
smaller
cabin
beyond
drawers
full
of
them
fancy
his
leaving
them
here
all
winter
and
they
do
seem
a
bit
damp
i
followed
her
into
a
cabin
a
tiny
den
but
pretty
enough
for
an
artist
instead
of
an
old
retired
what
shall
we
do
with
them
she
asked
we
might
keep
them
all
to
remember
him
by
perhaps
only
they
would
be
such
odd
sorts
of
souvenirs
for
girls
to
have
and
oh
my
goodness
nell
who
could
have
dreamed
of
captain
noble
in
in
whatever
it
is
whatever
it
was
it
was
silk
with
lovely
pink
stripes
of
several
shades
and
there
was
a
jacket
which
phil
was
just
holding
out
by
its
shoulders
to
admire
when
a
slight
cough
made
us
turn
our
heads
it
is
strange
what
individuality
there
can
be
in
a
cough
we
would
have
sworn
if
we
heard
it
while
locked
up
with
paasma
in
a
dark
cell
where
there
was
no
other
human
being
to
produce
it
that
he
have
uttered
such
an
interesting
cough
before
we
turned
we
knew
that
there
was
a
stranger
on
lorelei
but
we
were
surprised
when
we
saw
what
sort
of
stranger
he
was
he
stood
in
the
narrow
doorway
between
the
two
cabins
looking
at
us
with
bright
dark
eyes
like
robert
louis
stevenson
and
dressed
in
smart
flannels
and
a
tall
collar
such
as
robert
louis
stevenson
would
never
have
consented
to
wear
i
beg
your
pardon
said
he
in
a
nice
drawling
voice
which
told
me
that
he
first
seen
the
light
in
one
of
the
southern
states
of
america
i
beg
yours
said
i
somehow
phil
generally
waits
for
me
to
speak
first
in
emergencies
though
she
a
year
older
are
you
looking
for
any
one
the
caretaker
of
our
boat
perhaps
his
eyes
traveled
from
me
to
phil
from
phil
to
the
blue
garment
to
which
she
still
clung
from
the
blue
garment
to
the
pile
of
stiff
white
shirts
in
an
open
drawer
no
o
i
was
exactly
looking
for
any
one
he
slowly
replied
i
just
came
on
board
to
er
to
if
you
please
i
demanded
beginning
to
stiffen
i
a
right
to
know
because
this
is
our
boat
if
you
a
newspaper
reporter
or
anything
of
that
sort
please
go
away
but
if
you
have
business
no
it
was
only
pleasure
said
the
young
man
his
eyes
like
black
diamonds
i
did
know
the
boat
was
yours
whose
did
you
think
it
was
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
er
thought
it
was
mine
what
do
you
mean
i
cried
while
phil
threw
a
wild
questioning
look
at
the
shirts
and
dropped
the
blue
silk
jacket
that
is
temporarily
but
there
must
be
some
mistake
there
must
a
big
mistake
where
the
caretaker
he
came
on
board
with
us
the
young
man
eyes
twinkled
even
more
did
he
know
it
was
your
boat
why
of
course
we
told
him
it
was
left
to
us
in
a
will
we
just
come
to
claim
it
oh
i
think
i
begin
to
see
i
should
wonder
if
paasma
has
now
taken
to
his
bed
with
a
sudden
attack
of
whatever
the
dutch
have
instead
of
nervous
prostration
he
did
know
you
were
coming
not
till
we
came
it
must
have
been
quite
a
surprise
by
jove
the
old
fox
i
suppose
he
had
got
the
shadow
of
a
right
then
to
let
the
boat
to
me
my
gracious
breathed
phyllis
and
shut
up
the
drawer
of
shirts
with
a
snap
i
do
know
what
she
did
with
the
blue
silk
object
except
that
it
suddenly
and
mysteriously
disappeared
from
the
floor
perhaps
she
stood
on
it
what
an
awful
thing
said
i
you
sure
you
not
in
the
wrong
boat
you
sure
he
did
let
you
some
other
one
sure
there
is
no
other
one
in
holland
exactly
like
this
i
been
on
board
nearly
every
day
for
a
week
ever
since
i
began
to
since
you
began
to
have
her
done
up
nothing
to
speak
of
you
know
but
she
been
lying
here
all
winter
and
er
i
had
a
fancy
to
clean
house
then
all
these
things
are
yours
some
of
the
things
the
dutch
clock
the
the
silk
cushions
the
curtains
and
decorations
in
the
cabin
i
afraid
you
think
i
an
awful
meddler
but
you
see
i
did
know
paasma
told
me
he
had
a
right
to
let
the
boat
and
that
i
could
do
her
up
as
much
as
i
liked
the
old
wretch
i
gasped
and
you
walk
on
board
to
find
two
strange
girls
rummaging
among
your
your
then
i
could
help
laughing
when
i
remembered
how
phil
had
suggested
our
keeping
those
things
for
souvenirs
i
thought
i
must
be
having
a
dream
a
beautiful
dream
i
ignored
the
implied
compliment
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
i
asked
it
our
boat
there
no
doubt
about
that
but
with
these
things
of
yours
do
you
want
to
go
to
law
or
or
anything
good
heavens
no
i
i
tell
you
what
we
do
said
i
let
get
the
caretaker
here
and
have
it
out
with
him
perhaps
he
has
an
explanation
he
certain
to
have
several
shall
i
go
and
fetch
him
please
do
urged
phil
speaking
for
the
first
time
and
looking
adorably
pink
the
young
man
vanished
and
we
heard
him
running
up
the
steep
companion
if
that
the
right
word
for
it
two
steps
at
a
time
phil
and
i
stared
at
each
other
i
knew
something
awful
would
happen
said
she
this
is
a
judgment
he
too
nice
looking
to
be
a
judgment
said
i
i
like
his
taste
in
everything
including
shirts
do
you
do
speak
of
them
commanded
phil
we
shut
the
drawers
tightly
and
going
into
the
other
cabin
did
the
same
there
anyhow
i
saw
noble
on
the
sheets
and
blankets
i
said
thankfully
there
are
some
things
that
belong
to
us
it
will
end
in
our
going
home
at
once
i
suppose
said
phil
however
else
it
ends
it
wo
end
like
that
i
promise
you
i
assured
her
i
must
have
justice
but
he
must
have
his
things
oh
nell
have
you
really
got
relatives
in
rotterdam
or
did
you
make
that
up
to
frighten
the
caretaker
no
they
exist
i
never
spoke
of
them
to
you
because
i
never
thought
of
them
until
we
were
coming
here
and
then
i
was
afraid
if
i
did
think
it
the
proper
thing
to
implore
the
females
if
any
to
chaperon
us
besides
relations
so
often
turn
out
bores
all
i
know
about
mine
is
that
mother
told
me
father
had
relations
in
holland
in
rotterdam
and
if
she
and
i
had
stopped
in
england
to
take
care
of
you
and
your
father
perhaps
we
should
have
come
here
and
met
them
long
ago
well
do
let
look
them
up
and
get
them
to
help
i
wo
say
a
word
about
chaperons
perhaps
it
would
be
a
good
thing
that
wicked
old
caretaker
seemed
to
be
struck
with
respectful
awe
by
the
name
of
van
buren
i
never
knew
before
that
you
were
partly
dutch
you
did
i
often
boasted
of
my
knickerbocker
blood
yes
but
did
you
know
it
was
the
same
thing
where
your
knowledge
of
history
i
never
had
much
time
to
study
history
there
was
such
a
lot
that
came
before
said
phil
mildly
but
the
blood
sprang
to
her
cheeks
at
the
sound
of
a
step
on
the
stairs
our
rival
for
possession
of
the
boat
had
come
back
alone
that
old
rascal
has
with
extraordinary
suddenness
and
opportuneness
forgotten
every
word
of
english
he
announced
and
pretends
not
to
understand
german
i
ca
speak
dutch
can
you
no
said
i
not
a
syllable
but
he
spoke
english
quite
respectably
an
hour
ago
that
was
before
he
was
found
out
he
can
now
do
nothing
but
shake
his
head
and
say
or
something
that
sounds
like
that
i
thought
of
killing
him
but
concluded
it
would
be
better
to
wait
until
i
asked
you
how
you
like
it
done
it
ought
to
be
something
lingering
said
i
we
talk
it
over
but
first
perhaps
we
better
decide
what
to
be
done
with
you
see
we
come
to
holland
to
have
a
cruise
on
our
new
boat
otherwise
if
you
liked
as
the
real
owners
might
let
her
to
you
and
all
would
be
well
still
it
does
seem
a
shame
that
you
should
be
disappointed
when
you
took
in
good
faith
and
made
her
so
pretty
of
course
you
must
let
us
know
what
you
paid
a
few
gulden
said
the
young
man
evasively
never
mind
you
must
tell
how
many
unfortunately
that
wo
mend
your
disappointment
but
what
can
we
do
i
suppose
there
is
the
slightest
hope
that
you
could
er
take
me
as
a
passenger
oh
we
could
possibly
do
that
hastily
exclaimed
phil
alone
though
my
stepsister
miss
van
buren
has
cousins
in
rotterdam
we
come
from
england
without
a
chaperon
and
for
the
present
the
young
man
eyes
were
more
brilliant
than
ever
though
the
rest
of
his
face
looked
sad
oh
do
say
any
more
he
implored
i
see
how
it
is
i
ought
to
have
made
such
a
suggestion
my
only
excuse
is
i
was
thinking
of
my
poor
aunt
she
be
horribly
disappointed
i
care
most
for
her
and
what
she
feel
at
giving
up
the
cruise
oh
was
your
aunt
coming
i
asked
yes
my
scotch
aunt
such
a
charming
woman
i
an
american
you
know
clever
of
me
to
have
a
scotch
aunt
but
i
have
i
been
visiting
her
lately
near
edinburgh
you
would
like
lady
macnairne
i
think
phil
face
changed
she
is
the
last
girl
in
the
world
to
be
a
snob
but
hearing
that
this
young
man
had
a
scotch
aunt
with
a
title
was
almost
as
good
as
a
proper
introduction
and
there
really
is
something
singularly
winning
about
my
countryman
i
suppose
it
is
that
he
has
a
way
with
him
as
the
irish
say
besides
it
seemed
nice
of
so
young
a
man
to
care
so
much
about
a
mere
aunt
many
young
men
despise
aunts
as
companions
but
evidently
he
is
one
of
those
as
he
beautified
lorelei
simply
to
give
his
aunt
pleasure
it
really
seem
hard
i
said
now
if
only
phyllis
had
so
many
rules
of
propriety
but
to
my
surprise
the
very
thought
in
my
mind
which
i
had
dared
breathe
was
spoken
out
next
minute
by
phil
herself
maybe
we
might
come
to
some
kind
of
arrangement
as
you
have
an
aunt
she
faltered
yes
as
you
have
an
aunt
i
repeated
she
make
an
ideal
chaperon
for
young
ladies
hastily
went
on
the
southerner
i
should
like
you
to
meet
her
is
lady
macnairne
in
rotterdam
asked
phil
not
exactly
but
she
coming
almost
at
once
we
do
know
your
name
yet
said
phyllis
i
miss
rivers
my
stepsister
is
miss
van
buren
perhaps
you
better
introduce
yourself
i
shall
be
glad
to
returned
my
countryman
my
name
is
ronald
lester
starr
why
the
initials
are
just
right
i
murmured
i
know
what
you
mean
he
said
with
a
nice
smile
they
say
i
look
like
him
i
very
proud
you
think
i
ought
to
be
a
writer
but
not
i
paint
a
little
just
enough
to
call
myself
an
artist
oh
i
remember
i
broke
in
i
thought
the
name
sounded
familiar
you
had
a
picture
in
the
salon
this
spring
he
looked
anxious
did
you
see
it
no
not
even
a
copy
what
was
the
subject
horrid
of
me
to
ask
but
you
see
it
july
now
and
one
forgets
one
does
he
admitted
as
if
he
were
pleased
oh
it
was
only
a
portrait
of
my
aunt
your
scotch
aunt
yes
but
if
you
seen
it
and
then
should
see
her
you
might
even
recognize
her
i
er
did
try
to
make
a
striking
likeness
i
wish
i
seen
the
picture
said
i
and
i
thought
starr
must
be
very
modest
for
his
expression
suggested
that
he
did
echo
my
wish
do
you
think
you
could
let
my
aunt
and
me
join
you
he
asked
i
mean
to
crowd
up
your
boat
that
would
never
do
for
you
might
want
to
sleep
on
it
sometimes
but
i
might
get
a
barge
and
you
could
tow
it
i
thought
of
that
very
thing
indeed
i
practically
engaged
a
barge
my
friend
and
i
who
were
to
have
chummed
together
if
he
been
called
away
oh
you
know
that
was
a
plan
before
my
aunt
promised
to
come
quite
another
idea
but
what
i
mean
to
say
is
i
got
an
idea
for
hiring
a
barge
and
having
it
towed
by
the
i
could
have
had
a
studio
in
that
way
for
i
wanted
to
do
some
painting
i
just
come
back
from
seeing
rather
a
jolly
barge
that
to
let
when
i
er
stumbled
on
you
had
you
engaged
any
one
to
work
a
chauffeur
said
ronald
but
no
skipper
for
certain
yet
been
negotiating
dear
me
i
exclaimed
must
we
have
a
chauffeur
and
a
skipper
too
i
afraid
we
must
a
man
who
understands
the
waterways
of
holland
a
chauffeur
understands
only
the
motor
and
lucky
if
he
does
that
wo
it
be
dreadfully
expensive
asked
phyllis
the
skipper
wages
wo
be
more
than
five
or
six
dollars
a
bit
more
than
one
of
your
sovereigns
a
week
and
the
chauffeur
less
keep
themselves
but
i
meant
them
to
sleep
on
the
barge
the
skipper
ought
to
be
a
smart
chap
who
can
be
trusted
with
money
to
pay
the
expenses
of
the
boat
as
one
goes
along
and
all
sorts
of
things
the
chauffeur
can
buy
the
petrol
you
call
it
in
england
do
you
but
the
skipper
had
better
do
the
rest
it
does
seem
a
frightful
responsibility
for
two
girls
said
phyllis
of
course
if
you
consent
to
have
my
aunt
and
me
we
take
all
the
trouble
off
your
hands
and
half
the
expense
remarked
starr
my
poor
aunt
is
so
fond
of
the
water
and
there
so
little
in
scotland
little
in
scotland
well
only
a
few
lakes
and
rivers
it
does
seem
hard
she
should
be
disappointed
she
might
like
us
said
phyllis
she
would
lo
i
mean
she
be
no
aunt
of
mine
if
she
did
i
cut
her
off
with
a
penny
it
generally
aunts
who
do
that
with
their
nephews
said
i
ah
but
she
different
from
other
aunts
and
i
different
from
other
nephews
may
i
telegraph
that
she
to
come
i
thought
she
was
coming
i
mean
may
i
telegraph
that
she
to
be
a
chaperon
i
ought
to
let
her
know
she
might
er
want
more
dresses
or
bonnets
or
something
phil
and
i
laughed
and
so
did
starr
after
that
of
course
we
could
be
besides
we
did
want
to
be
i
could
see
that
even
to
phil
the
thought
of
a
cruise
taken
in
the
company
of
our
new
friend
and
that
ideal
chaperon
his
aunt
lady
macnairne
had
attractions
which
the
idea
of
a
cruise
alone
with
her
stepsister
had
lacked
well
in
the
circumstances
i
think
we
should
be
callous
brutes
not
to
say
i
replied
i
do
want
to
force
you
into
consenting
from
pure
generosity
went
on
starr
if
you
like
to
consult
your
relations
and
have
them
find
out
that
i
all
right
i
laughed
again
i
know
you
better
than
i
do
them
said
i
i
never
seen
them
yet
i
think
we
can
take
you
on
faith
just
as
you
taken
our
claims
to
the
boat
your
scotch
aunt
alone
would
be
a
guarantee
if
we
needed
one
a
scotch
aunt
sounds
so
reliable
but
perhaps
my
relatives
may
be
of
use
in
other
ways
as
they
lived
in
rotterdam
always
i
fancy
they
might
even
find
us
a
skipper
if
your
negotiations
fall
through
anyhow
i
write
a
letter
from
our
hotel
to
the
head
of
the
family
introducing
myself
as
his
cousin
twice
removed
what
is
your
hotel
if
i
may
ask
inquired
starr
i
told
him
and
it
turned
out
that
it
had
been
his
till
this
very
morning
when
he
had
removed
his
things
to
lorelei
with
the
intention
of
living
on
board
till
he
was
ready
to
start
now
he
proposed
to
have
them
taken
back
to
the
hotel
and
rearranged
on
the
barge
when
his
aunt
came
as
for
that
sly
old
person
the
caretaker
our
new
friend
volunteered
to
straighten
out
everything
with
him
our
affair
as
well
as
his
own
when
he
discovers
that
we
ca
be
bothered
having
the
law
of
him
as
he
richly
deserves
he
will
remember
his
english
or
i
find
the
way
to
make
him
said
the
young
man
in
such
a
joyous
confident
way
that
thereupon
i
dubbed
him
our
lucky
starr
iv
how
funny
if
i
got
relations
who
ca
speak
any
language
except
dutch
i
said
after
i
sent
a
letter
by
messenger
to
the
address
of
the
robert
van
buren
found
in
the
directory
but
half
an
hour
later
an
answer
came
back
in
english
mine
very
sincerely
robert
van
buren
would
give
himself
the
pleasure
of
calling
on
his
cousin
immediately
when
i
received
this
news
it
was
one
and
we
were
finishing
lunch
at
the
hotel
in
the
society
of
starr
who
had
already
wired
to
his
aunt
that
she
was
to
play
the
part
of
chaperon
i
read
the
letter
aloud
and
phil
and
i
decided
that
it
sounded
mother
spoke
once
or
twice
of
father
cousin
robert
van
buren
so
i
suppose
he
about
the
age
my
father
would
have
been
if
he
lived
i
said
i
hope
he
not
turn
out
a
horror
i
hope
he
not
forbid
you
to
associate
with
my
aunt
and
me
cut
in
starr
it
a
stiff
kind
of
handwriting
he
ca
make
me
stiff
said
i
cousins
twice
removed
count
except
when
they
can
be
useful
a
gentleman
in
the
to
see
you
miss
announced
the
waiter
who
could
speak
english
handing
me
a
card
on
a
tray
it
was
a
card
and
i
could
feel
in
the
least
related
to
it
especially
as
the
van
began
with
a
little
come
and
support
me
phil
i
begged
glancing
regretfully
at
a
seductive
bit
of
dutch
cheese
studded
with
caraway
seeds
which
it
would
be
rude
to
stop
and
eat
it
rather
an
ordeal
to
meet
a
new
relation
even
if
you
tell
yourself
that
you
do
care
what
he
thinks
of
you
i
slipped
behind
phil
making
her
enter
the
first
which
gave
me
time
to
peep
over
her
shoulder
and
fancy
we
had
been
directed
wrongly
there
was
a
man
in
the
room
but
he
could
not
have
been
a
man
in
the
days
when
mother
was
speaking
of
father
cousin
his
expression
only
was
old
it
might
have
been
a
hundred
the
rest
of
him
could
not
be
more
than
and
it
was
all
extremely
if
he
were
to
turn
out
a
cousin
i
should
not
have
to
be
ashamed
of
him
he
was
like
a
big
handsome
cavalryman
with
a
drooping
mustache
that
was
in
contrast
with
a
brown
skin
and
a
pair
of
the
solemnest
gray
eyes
i
ever
seen
except
in
the
face
of
a
baby
are
you
miss
van
buren
this
giant
asked
phil
gravely
holding
out
a
large
brown
hand
no
said
phil
unwilling
to
take
the
hand
under
false
pretenses
it
fell
and
so
did
the
handsome
face
if
anything
so
solemn
could
have
become
a
degree
graver
than
before
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
owner
of
both
speaking
english
with
a
scotch
accent
i
have
made
a
deceit
i
laughed
aloud
i
helen
van
buren
i
said
and
i
put
out
my
hand
his
swallowed
it
up
and
though
i
wear
only
one
ring
i
could
have
shrieked
yet
his
expression
was
not
flattering
there
are
persons
who
prefer
my
style
to
phil
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
one
of
them
i
felt
he
thought
me
garish
which
was
unjust
as
i
ca
help
it
if
my
complexion
is
very
white
and
very
pink
my
eyes
and
eyelashes
rather
dark
and
my
hair
decidedly
chestnut
i
have
done
any
of
it
myself
yet
i
believe
the
handsome
giant
suspected
me
and
was
sorry
that
phil
was
not
miss
van
buren
are
you
my
cousin
robert
van
buren
son
i
asked
i
am
the
only
robert
van
buren
now
living
he
answered
i
longed
to
be
flippant
and
say
that
there
were
probably
several
dotted
about
the
globe
if
we
only
knew
them
but
i
dared
not
under
those
eyes
absolutely
dared
not
instead
i
remarked
inanely
that
i
was
sorry
to
hear
his
father
was
not
alive
he
died
many
years
ago
we
have
got
over
it
he
replied
and
i
almost
laughed
again
but
that
angel
of
a
phil
looked
quite
sympathetic
in
a
few
minutes
we
settled
down
more
comfortably
with
phil
and
me
on
a
sofa
together
and
cousin
robert
on
a
chair
which
kept
me
in
fits
of
anxiety
by
creaking
and
looking
too
small
to
hold
him
phil
and
i
held
hands
as
girls
generally
do
when
they
are
at
all
if
they
sit
within
a
yard
of
each
other
and
we
all
began
to
talk
in
the
absurd
way
of
relations
or
people
you
have
seen
for
a
long
time
we
asked
robert
things
and
he
answered
and
when
we
encouraged
him
a
good
deal
he
asked
us
things
too
looking
mostly
at
phyllis
at
last
we
arrived
at
the
information
that
he
had
a
mother
and
two
sisters
who
spent
the
summers
at
scheveningen
in
a
villa
then
fell
a
silence
which
phil
tactfully
broke
by
saying
that
she
had
heard
of
scheveningen
it
must
be
a
beautiful
place
and
she
been
brought
up
with
a
cup
that
came
from
there
when
she
was
good
as
a
child
she
was
allowed
to
play
with
it
i
should
think
you
were
always
good
said
cousin
robert
phyllis
blushed
and
then
he
blushed
too
under
his
brown
skin
i
have
also
a
fiancée
at
scheveningen
he
went
on
à
propos
of
nothing
unless
of
the
blush
is
she
a
dutch
girl
i
asked
oh
yes
i
suppose
she
is
very
pretty
and
charming
i
do
not
know
i
am
used
to
her
we
have
played
together
when
we
were
young
i
go
every
saturday
to
scheveningen
when
they
are
there
to
stay
till
monday
oh
said
phil
oh
said
i
silence
again
then
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
come
and
see
us
so
quickly
after
i
wrote
it
was
my
duty
and
my
pleasure
too
as
second
thought
you
must
tell
me
your
plans
so
we
told
them
and
cousin
robert
did
not
approve
i
do
not
think
it
will
do
said
he
firmly
i
afraid
it
must
do
i
returned
with
equal
firmness
disguised
under
a
smile
phil
apologized
for
me
as
she
gave
me
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
we
been
very
happy
together
nell
and
i
she
explained
but
we
have
never
had
much
excitement
this
is
our
first
chance
and
we
shall
be
chaperoned
by
lady
macnairne
yes
but
she
is
the
aunt
of
the
stranger
young
man
geniuses
are
never
strangers
he
is
a
genius
i
said
you
no
idea
how
his
salon
picture
was
praised
but
his
character
what
do
you
know
of
that
it
his
aunt
character
that
matters
most
and
the
macnairnes
are
irreproachable
i
had
never
heard
the
name
until
this
morning
but
there
are
some
things
which
you
seem
to
have
been
born
knowing
and
i
was
in
a
mood
to
stake
my
life
upon
lady
macnairne
it
is
better
that
you
see
my
mother
said
cousin
robert
it
will
be
sweet
of
her
to
call
on
us
i
do
not
think
she
can
do
that
she
is
too
large
and
she
does
not
easily
move
from
scheveningen
but
if
she
writes
you
a
note
to
ask
you
and
miss
rivers
you
will
go
is
it
not
with
pleasure
i
said
if
it
is
too
far
you
see
lady
macnairne
may
arrive
soon
and
when
she
does
but
now
i
will
see
my
mother
and
i
will
bring
back
the
letter
i
will
drive
with
an
automobile
which
a
friend
has
lent
me
rudolph
brederode
and
when
you
have
read
the
note
you
will
both
go
in
the
car
with
me
to
scheveningen
to
stay
for
all
night
perhaps
more
oh
we
could
think
of
staying
all
night
i
exclaimed
we
stop
here
till
it
is
not
right
that
you
stop
here
i
will
go
now
and
please
you
will
pack
up
to
be
ready
we
have
unpacked
yet
i
said
but
we
could
possibly
for
one
thing
your
mother
may
not
find
it
convenient
my
cousin
robert
jaw
set
she
surely
will
find
it
convenient
what
people
you
dutch
are
the
words
broke
from
me
he
looked
surprised
we
are
the
same
like
others
i
think
you
are
the
same
as
you
used
to
be
hundreds
of
years
ago
when
you
first
began
to
do
as
you
pleased
and
i
suppose
you
have
been
doing
it
ever
since
cousin
robert
smiled
maybe
we
like
our
own
way
he
admitted
and
maybe
you
get
it
i
hope
and
now
i
will
go
to
order
the
automobile
he
glanced
at
his
watch
an
gold
one
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
i
will
be
at
scheveningen
fifteen
minutes
there
will
be
enough
another
hour
and
a
quarter
to
come
back
i
will
be
for
you
at
four
you
do
allow
any
time
for
the
motor
to
break
down
i
said
i
do
not
hope
that
she
will
break
down
she
is
a
dutch
car
and
serves
a
dutch
master
oh
no
certainly
she
wo
break
down
he
stared
not
fully
comprehending
but
he
did
not
pull
his
mustache
as
an
englishman
does
when
he
wonders
if
he
is
being
chaffed
he
shook
hands
with
us
gravely
and
bowed
several
times
at
the
door
then
he
was
gone
and
we
knew
that
if
he
did
come
back
at
four
with
that
letter
from
his
mother
it
would
be
because
she
or
the
motor
was
more
dutch
than
he
when
he
disappeared
phil
and
i
went
out
into
the
garden
for
the
sole
purpose
we
told
each
other
of
having
coffee
and
when
we
saw
starr
sitting
with
an
empty
cup
and
a
cigarette
we
both
exclaimed
oh
are
you
here
as
if
we
were
surprised
so
i
suppose
we
were
illustration
both
exclaimed
oh
are
you
here
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
cousin
robert
and
said
what
a
fellow
he
was
a
regular
viking
but
when
we
agreed
he
appeared
depressed
oh
my
prophetic
soul
he
murmured
the
cousin
will
want
his
mother
to
go
with
you
and
my
poor
aunt
will
be
nowhere
his
mother
is
too
large
for
the
boat
i
assured
him
confidently
starr
brightened
at
this
but
clouded
again
when
he
heard
that
phil
and
i
were
to
stop
the
night
with
my
cousins
they
will
tear
you
away
from
me
i
mean
from
my
aunt
he
said
i
shook
my
head
no
it
difficult
to
resist
the
dutch
i
find
when
they
want
you
to
do
anything
but
when
they
want
you
to
do
anything
why
that
is
too
much
your
pride
comes
to
the
rescue
and
you
fight
for
your
life
we
if
you
like
for
your
aunt
sake
wo
we
phil
yes
for
your
aunt
sake
she
echoed
we
can
depend
upon
you
then
my
aunt
and
i
upon
us
and
you
angels
my
aunt
will
bless
you
and
now
would
you
care
to
look
at
the
barge
i
got
the
refusal
of
if
you
going
to
tow
her
you
ought
to
know
what
she
like
i
do
think
she
put
to
shame
though
for
she
good
of
her
kind
belongs
to
a
dutch
artist
who
in
the
habit
of
living
aboard
but
he
has
a
commission
for
work
in
france
this
summer
and
wants
to
let
her
she
lying
near
by
who
would
have
thought
when
we
arrived
a
few
hours
before
strangers
in
rotterdam
that
we
would
be
sauntering
about
the
town
with
an
american
young
man
calmly
making
plans
for
a
cruise
in
his
society
i
sure
that
if
a
palmist
had
contrived
to
capture
phil
virtuous
little
hand
and
foretold
any
such
events
my
stepsister
would
have
considered
them
as
impossible
as
monstrous
nevertheless
she
now
accepted
the
arrangements
fate
made
for
her
as
quietly
as
the
air
she
breathed
for
was
not
the
figure
of
our
future
chaperon
already
hovering
in
the
background
title
and
old
scotch
blood
and
all
sanctifying
the
whole
proceeding
phil
was
so
enchanted
with
the
barge
which
turned
out
to
be
a
sort
of
glorified
dutch
that
she
was
fired
with
sudden
enthusiasm
for
our
cruise
and
the
thing
really
is
a
delectable
craft
stout
with
a
bow
and
a
high
perky
nose
of
brass
standing
up
in
the
air
as
one
sees
the
beak
of
a
duck
sometimes
among
its
feathers
and
pointing
upward
waterspin
which
means
is
the
creature
name
and
she
is
a
brilliant
emerald
lined
and
painted
round
her
windows
with
an
equally
brilliant
scarlet
this
bold
scheme
of
color
would
be
no
less
than
shocking
on
the
thames
but
sitting
in
that
canal
in
a
retired
part
of
rotterdam
waterspin
looked
like
a
pleasing
dutch
caricature
of
ark
inside
we
found
her
equally
desirable
with
four
little
boxes
of
yellow
painted
floors
and
bunks
curtained
with
dimity
stiff
as
a
frozen
crust
of
snow
a
studio
with
a
few
charming
bits
of
old
painted
dutch
furniture
to
redeem
it
from
bareness
and
a
kitchen
which
roused
all
phil
domestic
instincts
oh
the
darling
blue
and
white
china
and
brass
things
and
those
adorable
pewter
pots
she
cried
i
love
this
boat
i
could
be
quite
happy
living
on
her
all
the
rest
of
my
life
so
you
shall
i
mean
while
she
is
mine
you
must
consider
yourselves
as
much
at
home
on
her
as
on
your
own
boat
stammered
starr
or
if
you
rather
take
up
your
quarters
on
the
barge
no
no
nell
and
i
will
live
on
but
i
do
think
if
let
me
i
come
sometimes
and
cook
things
in
that
heavenly
kitchen
let
you
whatever
you
make
shall
be
preserved
in
amber
would
it
be
better
to
eat
it
asked
phil
can
you
cook
i
should
as
soon
expect
to
see
a
lady
run
down
the
golden
stair
into
a
kitchen
i
can
make
delicious
toast
and
and
salad
dressing
ca
i
nell
and
lots
of
other
things
pluperfect
i
only
wish
i
could
i
sha
trouble
your
kitchen
mr
starr
but
you
can
sing
so
beautifully
dear
and
sketch
too
and
your
stories
do
dare
speak
of
them
i
glared
and
poor
phil
unselfishly
anxious
to
show
off
my
accomplishments
to
lady
macnairne
nephew
was
silent
and
abashed
i
hoped
that
starr
had
heard
he
was
delighted
with
our
approval
of
the
barge
and
enlarged
upon
the
good
times
before
us
no
one
could
know
holland
properly
without
seeing
her
from
the
waterways
he
said
and
we
would
know
her
as
few
foreigners
did
she
could
not
hide
a
secret
from
us
that
was
worth
finding
out
he
had
planned
any
regular
tour
for
himself
he
had
meant
to
wander
here
and
there
as
the
fancy
seized
him
but
now
the
route
was
for
us
to
decide
whatever
pleased
us
would
please
him
as
for
his
painting
you
could
hardly
go
round
a
corner
in
holland
without
stumbling
on
a
scene
for
a
picture
and
he
should
come
across
them
everywhere
he
had
no
choice
of
direction
but
in
seven
or
eight
weeks
we
could
explore
the
waterways
pretty
thoroughly
our
skipper
would
be
able
to
put
us
on
the
right
track
and
let
us
miss
nothing
had
we
asked
van
buren
if
he
any
skippers
up
his
sleeve
oh
well
it
did
matter
that
we
forgotten
he
himself
had
the
names
of
several
besides
some
men
he
had
already
seen
and
he
would
interview
them
all
it
was
certain
that
in
a
day
or
two
at
most
he
could
find
exactly
the
right
person
for
the
place
and
we
might
be
sure
that
while
we
were
away
at
scheveningen
he
would
not
be
idle
in
our
common
interests
after
all
even
must
admit
that
men
are
of
some
use
said
phil
when
we
were
at
the
hotel
again
waiting
for
cousin
robert
and
his
car
supposing
you
had
to
organize
the
tour
alone
as
we
expected
could
you
have
done
it
of
course
i
replied
bravely
what
and
engaged
a
chauffeur
and
a
skipper
who
would
have
told
you
what
to
do
i
sure
we
could
never
have
started
without
your
cousin
robert
and
mr
starr
what
has
cousin
robert
got
to
do
with
it
i
demanded
phil
reflected
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
know
exactly
but
he
is
so
and
there
so
much
of
him
i
hope
there
wo
be
too
much
said
i
i
like
tall
men
remarked
phil
dreamily
then
she
looked
at
her
watch
it
five
minutes
to
four
he
ought
to
be
here
soon
he
come
inside
ten
minutes
i
prophesied
but
he
came
in
three
i
might
have
known
he
would
be
before
his
time
rather
than
after
and
he
arrived
with
a
nice
letter
from
his
mother
neither
phyllis
nor
i
had
ever
been
in
a
until
we
got
gingerly
into
that
one
i
had
heard
her
say
that
she
would
never
thus
risk
her
life
but
she
made
no
mention
of
this
resolution
to
cousin
robert
if
she
had
it
would
have
been
useless
for
without
doubt
she
would
in
the
end
have
had
to
go
and
it
saved
time
not
to
demur
v
the
car
which
stood
throbbing
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
was
large
and
handsome
as
if
made
to
match
my
cousin
and
it
was
painted
flame
color
i
am
just
learning
to
drive
said
robert
who
wore
a
which
was
particularly
becoming
i
do
not
know
much
about
automobiles
yet
soon
i
shall
buy
one
it
is
rowing
i
like
best
and
skating
in
winter
though
i
have
not
time
to
amuse
myself
except
at
the
end
of
weeks
for
i
am
manager
of
my
poor
father
factory
but
my
fiancée
likes
the
automobile
and
to
please
her
i
am
learning
with
my
car
that
is
good
of
you
said
phyllis
yes
it
is
he
replied
gravely
would
you
that
i
drive
or
the
chauffeur
he
has
more
experience
i
left
the
decision
to
phil
as
she
is
the
timid
one
but
to
my
surprise
she
answered
oh
you
of
course
cousin
robert
looked
pleased
are
you
not
afraid
he
inquired
beaming
ye
es
i
am
afraid
for
i
never
been
before
but
i
shall
be
less
afraid
with
you
than
with
him
and
she
glanced
at
a
weedy
youth
who
was
pouring
oil
from
a
tin
into
something
obscure
will
you
sit
in
front
by
my
side
he
asked
and
it
was
only
after
phil
had
accepted
the
invitation
that
he
remembered
to
hope
i
would
mind
the
chauffeur
being
in
the
with
me
it
must
have
been
one
of
you
he
added
and
you
and
i
are
cousins
twice
removed
i
murmured
but
he
was
helping
phil
into
the
car
and
did
not
hear
it
was
a
wild
moment
when
we
started
but
it
would
have
looked
odd
to
cling
to
the
chauffeur
for
protection
so
i
did
nothing
and
it
calmed
me
to
see
how
phyllis
bore
herself
she
did
even
grasp
the
arm
of
the
seat
she
merely
gazed
up
into
cousin
robert
face
with
a
sweetly
feminine
look
which
said
my
one
hope
is
in
you
but
i
trust
you
utterly
it
was
enough
to
melt
the
heart
of
a
stone
giant
even
when
seen
through
goggles
i
had
an
idea
that
this
giant
was
not
made
of
stone
and
i
wondered
what
the
fiancée
of
my
cousin
twice
removed
was
made
of
after
the
first
thrill
of
starting
when
we
seemed
to
be
tearing
like
a
tailless
comet
through
a
very
small
portion
of
space
not
designed
to
hold
comets
i
grew
happy
though
far
from
tranquil
i
ca
imagine
people
ever
feeling
really
tranquil
in
an
automobile
and
i
believe
they
do
though
they
may
pretend
i
sure
i
should
not
even
if
i
became
a
professional
chauffeur
which
heaven
forbid
but
part
of
the
enjoyment
came
through
not
feeling
tranquil
there
was
a
savage
joy
in
thinking
every
instant
that
you
were
going
to
be
dashed
to
pieces
or
else
that
you
would
dash
somebody
else
to
pieces
while
all
the
time
you
knew
in
your
heart
that
nothing
of
the
sort
would
happen
the
car
went
splendidly
and
i
believe
i
should
have
guessed
it
was
a
dutch
one
even
if
cousin
robert
had
told
me
it
made
so
little
noise
yet
moved
so
masterfully
and
gave
an
impression
of
so
much
reserve
power
indeed
i
might
have
thought
out
several
nice
similes
if
there
had
been
quantities
of
trams
and
heavy
drays
blundering
about
or
if
the
inhabitants
of
rotterdam
had
not
had
a
habit
of
walking
in
large
family
groups
in
the
middle
of
the
street
the
big
horn
through
which
robert
every
now
and
again
blew
a
mournful
blast
was
confusing
when
it
arrived
in
the
midst
of
an
idea
and
a
little
curved
thing
like
the
of
old
pictures
into
which
the
chauffeur
occasionally
mewed
was
as
disconcerting
to
my
nerves
as
to
those
of
the
pedestrians
who
hopped
out
of
the
way
the
more
we
saw
of
rotterdam
the
more
extraordinary
did
the
city
appear
and
the
more
did
i
wonder
that
people
should
refer
to
it
merely
as
a
port
it
is
not
a
bad
town
robert
said
to
phyllis
in
the
way
in
which
when
talking
to
strangers
we
allude
to
that
spot
of
earth
we
happen
to
inhabit
i
would
not
change
to
live
at
the
hague
though
the
diplomatic
set
give
sneers
at
us
and
call
us
commercial
just
as
edinburgh
sneers
at
glasgow
cut
in
phil
yes
like
that
i
have
been
much
to
scotland
on
my
business
and
i
know
answered
robert
but
we
have
many
good
things
to
show
strangers
if
they
would
look
pictures
and
museums
and
old
streets
but
it
is
not
fashionable
to
admire
rotterdam
you
should
see
the
boompjes
at
night
when
the
lights
shine
in
the
water
it
is
only
a
big
dyke
but
once
it
was
the
part
where
the
rich
people
lived
and
those
who
know
about
such
things
say
the
old
houses
are
good
and
i
should
like
you
to
see
where
i
live
with
my
mother
and
sisters
it
is
an
old
house
too
in
a
big
garden
with
a
pond
and
an
island
covered
with
flowers
but
we
do
not
pass
now
so
you
must
see
it
a
future
day
to
say
all
this
cousin
robert
had
to
yell
above
the
roar
of
traffic
on
the
stone
pavements
but
as
town
changed
into
country
we
left
the
stones
behind
and
came
into
the
strangest
road
i
have
ever
seen
it
ran
beside
a
little
river
the
schie
which
looked
like
a
canal
and
it
was
made
of
neat
bricks
laid
edge
to
edge
klinker
we
call
it
said
cousin
robert
it
good
for
driving
never
much
dust
or
mud
and
when
you
motor
it
gives
grip
to
the
it
would
do
for
us
of
the
netherlands
to
leave
our
roads
bare
why
what
would
happen
i
bent
toward
him
to
ask
would
the
bottom
of
holland
drop
out
i
think
yes
he
replied
seriously
the
saying
is
that
there
has
been
as
much
of
sand
laid
on
the
road
between
rotterdam
and
the
hague
as
would
reach
the
top
of
the
cathedral
spire
at
amsterdam
which
you
will
see
one
day
dear
me
and
yet
it
so
low
and
flat
now
soliloquized
phil
lower
than
the
canals
it
is
nothing
here
to
some
places
we
work
hard
to
save
the
country
we
have
made
with
our
hands
we
netherlanders
all
the
streets
and
gardens
of
rotterdam
and
other
towns
too
sink
down
and
down
but
we
are
used
to
that
we
do
not
stop
to
care
but
go
to
work
adding
more
steps
up
to
the
houses
so
we
can
get
in
at
our
doors
i
think
you
are
wonderful
said
phyllis
i
have
not
done
very
much
myself
modestly
replied
cousin
robert
but
you
would
if
necessary
i
sure
you
have
been
like
the
little
boy
who
saw
the
trickle
of
water
coming
out
of
the
dyke
and
put
his
thumb
phil
if
you
bring
up
that
story
i
ask
cousin
robert
van
buren
to
run
into
a
windmill
and
kill
you
i
shrieked
over
her
shoulder
but
i
would
not
do
that
said
he
oh
yes
he
really
was
wonderful
my
cousin
robert
there
is
a
spot
to
interest
an
american
he
deigned
to
fling
a
sop
to
me
nodding
vaguely
upward
at
some
roofs
on
the
river
maas
did
you
ever
hear
of
oude
delftshaven
cousin
but
i
do
suppose
you
have
indeed
i
have
i
shrieked
at
him
i
would
be
a
true
descendant
of
knickerbocker
stock
if
i
had
on
july
some
pilgrim
fathers
i
not
sure
whether
they
were
fathers
then
or
afterwards
set
sail
from
oude
delftshaven
for
america
i
did
think
it
necessary
to
explain
that
knickerbocker
as
i
was
i
had
absorbed
this
fact
only
the
other
day
in
reading
up
holland
i
was
still
more
inclined
to
be
reticent
as
to
the
newness
of
my
knowledge
when
it
appeared
that
phil
knew
something
of
a
poem
on
the
subject
by
hemans
i
could
not
allow
my
english
stepsister
to
be
better
informed
than
i
concerning
a
country
which
i
already
began
to
regard
as
a
sort
of
confiscated
family
estate
that
ought
to
have
been
mine
we
were
going
fast
now
so
fast
that
the
tears
came
to
my
eyes
as
the
breeze
rushed
against
my
lashes
there
schiedam
said
robert
indicating
a
town
that
stood
up
darkly
out
of
the
green
plain
you
know
they
make
the
famous
there
we
had
never
heard
of
geneva
in
liquid
form
but
it
appeared
that
geneva
or
hollands
and
gin
were
all
the
same
thing
and
cousin
robert
seemed
almost
offended
when
i
said
it
was
nice
with
hot
water
and
sugar
for
a
cold
in
the
head
i
do
know
whether
the
little
schie
is
really
an
idyllic
stream
or
whether
the
glamor
of
that
azure
day
was
upon
it
for
me
but
our
first
waterway
seemed
exquisite
as
we
spun
along
through
country
of
wide
horizons
and
magic
atmosphere
there
were
pretty
houses
with
balconies
screened
with
roses
cataracts
of
roses
yellow
and
pink
and
white
we
flew
by
lawns
like
the
lawns
of
england
and
thick
dark
patches
of
forest
where
the
sun
rained
gold
there
were
meadows
where
a
red
flame
of
poppies
leaped
among
the
wheat
and
quenched
their
fire
in
the
silver
river
of
waving
grain
there
were
other
meadows
green
and
sunny
where
cows
were
being
milked
into
blue
pails
lined
with
scarlet
and
there
were
bowery
divided
into
snug
little
arbors
for
two
where
each
swain
could
woo
his
nymph
unseen
by
the
swain
and
nymph
though
all
couples
were
in
sight
from
the
river
now
we
coming
to
delft
said
robert
long
before
i
thought
that
we
could
be
near
that
ancient
town
if
rudolph
brederode
who
lends
me
this
car
were
here
he
could
tell
much
about
the
history
my
cousin
went
on
mentioning
his
friend
for
the
second
time
as
if
with
pride
he
is
the
sort
of
fellow
who
knows
all
the
things
to
know
though
he
is
a
great
sportsman
too
i
never
took
interest
in
history
but
william
the
silent
is
our
hero
so
even
i
know
of
him
and
delft
it
was
at
oude
delft
he
was
murdered
he
was
one
of
my
heroes
when
i
was
a
little
girl
said
i
i
can
recall
my
father
telling
splendid
stories
about
him
as
good
as
fairy
tales
the
best
was
about
the
way
he
earned
the
nickname
of
william
the
silent
i
gazed
with
interest
at
the
place
where
one
of
the
greatest
figures
in
the
history
of
the
world
had
lived
and
died
a
shady
lovable
old
town
it
seemed
we
drove
into
a
pleasant
street
which
looked
so
clear
and
green
from
the
mirror
of
its
canal
to
the
gothic
arch
of
its
close
arbor
of
fragrant
that
it
was
like
a
tunnel
of
illuminated
beryl
the
extraordinary
brilliance
of
the
windows
added
to
the
effect
each
pane
was
a
separate
glittering
square
of
crystal
and
the
green
light
flickered
and
glanced
on
the
quaint
little
tilted
in
which
dutch
ladies
see
the
life
of
the
streets
themselves
unseen
the
houses
were
of
brown
or
purplish
brick
with
curiously
ornamented
doorways
the
stucco
decorations
running
in
wavy
lines
up
to
the
level
of
the
first
story
windows
the
white
as
pearl
in
the
green
glimmer
but
there
was
nothing
striking
in
the
way
of
architecture
until
we
swept
into
sight
of
an
old
gothic
building
blazing
with
colored
ancient
and
resplendent
that
the
gemeenlandshuis
van
delfsland
said
cousin
robert
with
a
beautiful
confidence
in
our
comprehension
and
then
slowing
down
the
car
before
a
dark
high
wall
with
a
door
in
the
midst
here
the
prinzenhof
where
william
the
silent
lived
and
where
balthazar
gérard
killed
him
oh
i
exclaimed
as
he
was
driving
on
ca
we
stop
ca
we
go
in
we
could
but
i
should
not
like
to
make
us
late
for
dinner
cousin
robert
demurred
dinner
why
it
ages
before
dinner
and
we
dine
at
five
said
he
phil
and
i
gazed
at
each
other
with
lifted
eyebrows
phil
was
pale
and
i
felt
a
sudden
constriction
of
the
throat
the
idea
of
eating
dinner
at
the
hour
when
our
souls
cried
for
tea
and
toast
was
little
short
of
ghastly
noblesse
obliged
us
to
conceal
our
loathing
but
i
did
venture
meekly
to
suggest
that
if
we
drove
faster
afterwards
perhaps
we
might
spare
a
few
minutes
for
the
prinzenhof
there
are
things
in
the
hague
you
will
want
to
stop
for
too
said
robert
but
my
sisters
and
i
can
bring
you
to
see
the
pictures
and
the
royal
palace
and
the
huis
ten
bosch
besides
i
remember
my
mother
meant
to
put
off
dinner
for
us
until
six
so
we
will
maybe
not
be
too
late
one
should
be
thankful
for
the
smallest
mercies
and
i
hoped
that
the
craving
for
tea
might
have
subsided
into
callous
resignation
by
six
what
phil
as
a
born
englishwoman
must
have
been
feeling
i
could
easily
conceive
and
it
was
a
pity
this
shock
to
her
system
had
arrived
on
our
first
day
for
only
just
before
the
blow
she
had
said
that
holland
seemed
too
enchanting
she
was
glad
after
all
that
she
had
come
and
would
like
to
learn
the
language
luckily
cousin
robert
had
remembered
the
change
in
the
domestic
program
before
it
was
too
late
otherwise
i
am
sure
he
would
have
denied
us
the
prinzenhof
and
we
should
have
had
to
sneak
back
by
ourselves
as
it
was
we
were
allowed
to
have
our
own
way
practically
for
the
first
time
since
we
came
to
holland
robert
rang
a
bell
and
a
man
appeared
who
let
us
into
the
courtyard
more
like
the
courtyard
of
a
monastery
than
a
palace
and
among
the
historical
which
clung
to
cousin
robert
memory
was
the
fact
that
the
place
actually
had
been
a
monastery
sacred
to
agatha
we
crossed
the
courtyard
and
just
inside
another
door
found
ourselves
on
the
scene
of
the
great
tragedy
i
knew
it
by
instinct
before
anybody
told
me
for
suddenly
the
whole
story
came
back
just
as
i
heard
it
from
my
father
not
as
i
read
it
in
books
of
history
so
vividly
did
he
paint
each
detail
that
i
used
to
grow
hysterical
in
my
infantine
way
and
he
was
scolded
by
mother
for
filling
the
child
mind
with
horrors
yes
there
was
the
stairway
with
the
pale
light
coming
from
the
low
window
there
was
the
white
wall
which
had
been
spattered
with
the
hero
life
blood
there
was
the
open
door
of
the
where
he
had
been
carried
back
to
die
there
the
white
pillar
behind
which
the
murderer
crouched
and
there
the
dark
archway
through
which
gérard
had
run
his
heart
beating
thickly
with
the
hope
of
escape
and
the
thought
of
the
horse
waiting
beyond
the
ramparts
and
the
moat
i
fancied
i
could
see
the
prince
handsome
still
in
the
fashion
of
dress
he
affected
since
the
days
of
the
water
beggars
fame
a
stately
figure
in
his
rough
and
hat
with
the
silk
cord
of
the
beggars
round
the
felt
crown
and
i
could
almost
smell
the
smoke
from
the
murderer
pistol
bought
with
the
money
william
generosity
had
given
there
were
the
holes
in
the
wall
made
by
the
poisoned
bullets
how
real
it
all
seemed
how
the
centuries
between
slipped
away
let
me
see
what
had
the
date
been
i
ought
to
remember
july
phil
what
day
of
the
month
is
this
i
demanded
with
a
start
phil
turned
at
the
open
door
of
the
which
i
could
see
had
been
made
into
a
museum
july
tenth
she
answered
promptly
for
you
can
never
catch
phil
tripping
as
to
a
date
or
a
day
of
the
week
even
if
you
should
shake
her
out
of
her
first
sleep
to
ask
then
it
the
anniversary
of
his
death
i
exclaimed
july
it
was
how
strange
we
should
have
come
on
the
very
day
it
makes
it
seem
a
pilgrimage
i
do
find
it
strange
said
cousin
robert
many
people
come
every
day
of
the
year
having
thus
poured
the
cold
water
of
common
sense
on
my
sentiment
he
dragged
us
into
the
museum
to
see
relics
of
william
and
i
should
have
been
resentful
had
not
my
eyes
suddenly
met
other
eyes
looking
down
from
the
wall
they
were
the
eyes
of
william
the
silent
himself
when
he
was
young
painted
eyes
yet
they
spoke
to
me
i
do
know
how
fine
that
portrait
may
be
as
a
work
of
art
but
it
is
marvelously
real
i
understood
in
a
moment
why
little
anna
of
saxony
had
been
so
mad
to
marry
him
i
knew
that
in
her
place
i
should
have
overcome
just
as
many
obstacles
to
make
that
dark
haunting
face
the
face
of
my
husband
of
course
i
often
read
that
william
of
orange
was
a
handsome
man
as
well
as
a
dashing
and
extravagant
gallant
in
his
young
days
but
never
till
now
had
i
realized
how
singularly
attractive
he
must
have
been
the
face
in
the
portrait
was
sad
and
as
thoughtful
as
if
he
had
sat
to
the
artist
on
the
day
he
heard
the
dreadful
secret
of
the
fate
which
philip
of
spain
and
francis
of
france
were
plotting
for
the
netherlands
the
day
that
decided
his
future
and
gave
him
his
name
of
william
the
silent
yet
in
spite
of
its
melancholy
almost
sternness
it
won
me
as
no
pictured
face
of
a
man
ever
did
before
this
is
a
great
day
for
me
i
said
to
phil
who
was
close
behind
not
only
am
i
seeing
holland
for
the
first
time
but
i
fallen
in
love
with
william
the
silent
i
laughed
as
i
made
this
announcement
though
i
was
half
in
earnest
and
turning
to
see
whether
i
had
shocked
cousin
robert
i
found
him
in
conversation
with
a
tall
young
man
near
the
door
the
man
he
wore
a
gray
suit
and
carried
a
straw
hat
in
his
hand
had
his
back
to
me
and
i
remembered
having
seen
the
same
back
in
the
museum
before
we
came
in
now
he
was
going
out
and
evidently
he
and
cousin
robert
had
recognized
each
other
as
acquaintances
as
i
looked
he
turned
and
i
saw
his
face
it
was
so
like
the
face
of
the
portrait
that
i
felt
myself
grow
red
how
i
did
hope
he
had
overheard
that
silly
speech
for
a
moment
his
eyes
and
mine
met
as
mine
had
met
the
eyes
of
the
portrait
then
he
shook
hands
with
robert
and
was
gone
very
odd
said
my
cousin
the
giant
strolling
toward
us
again
that
was
rudolph
brederode
and
he
glanced
at
me
his
nickname
among
his
friends
is
william
the
silent
why
i
asked
pretending
unconsciousness
do
you
think
there
is
a
likeness
i
bad
at
seeing
likenesses
said
i
why
nell
i
do
think
you
are
phil
defended
me
against
myself
you
always
seeing
the
strangest
resemblances
between
clouds
and
animals
and
plants
and
people
and
there
no
end
to
what
you
find
on
wall
papers
this
very
day
you
thought
starr
like
robert
louis
stevenson
though
i
that
when
my
imagination
running
loose
i
explained
cousin
robert
is
talking
about
facts
oh
said
phil
it
rather
an
ugly
portrait
i
went
on
i
do
suppose
william
of
orange
was
like
it
one
bit
but
we
have
two
reasons
for
calling
brederode
the
taciturn
said
robert
he
has
a
way
to
keep
still
about
things
which
other
people
discuss
sometimes
it
makes
men
angry
but
especially
the
ladies
brederode
does
not
care
what
others
think
he
descends
from
the
great
brederode
but
he
is
different
the
water
beggar
was
brave
i
remarked
rudolph
is
brave
retorted
cousin
robert
firing
up
you
will
think
so
what
is
he
going
to
do
i
asked
something
to
startle
holland
holland
has
seen
him
do
it
before
but
you
have
not
you
will
see
him
ride
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
jumping
contests
at
the
at
scheveningen
it
will
be
a
fine
show
but
brederode
and
his
horses
will
be
the
best
my
mother
has
a
box
she
will
take
you
but
i
thought
you
were
going
to
take
us
to
the
hague
and
the
huis
ten
bosch
that
will
be
in
the
early
morning
perhaps
my
sisters
will
go
and
after
we
have
finished
the
pictures
at
the
hague
we
will
meet
my
mother
and
my
fiancée
freule
menela
van
der
windt
at
the
race
grounds
about
two
and
the
show
will
not
be
over
till
seven
so
dinner
will
be
late
you
dutch
are
a
strong
race
i
murmured
brederode
says
he
always
comes
here
when
he
anywhere
in
the
neighborhood
for
a
look
at
the
prinzenhof
on
the
tenth
of
july
robert
went
on
odd
is
it
not
no
more
odd
than
that
we
should
have
been
here
said
i
but
i
said
this
in
a
low
voice
and
it
only
a
man
who
is
in
love
with
a
girl
who
hears
her
when
she
mutters
he
asked
how
the
automobile
was
going
and
i
mentioned
one
or
two
things
that
bothered
me
so
he
has
gone
out
to
talk
to
the
chauffeur
cousin
robert
continued
unable
to
turn
his
thoughts
from
his
admirable
crichton
do
you
think
you
seen
enough
it
is
late
and
when
i
told
brederode
i
was
showing
delft
to
my
american
cousin
and
an
english
friend
he
said
i
must
take
you
to
the
new
church
the
tomb
of
william
and
of
hugo
grotius
he
wanted
you
to
go
to
the
old
church
too
and
see
the
place
where
van
tromp
lies
but
we
shall
not
have
time
besides
it
would
not
please
miss
rivers
why
not
asked
phyllis
you
are
english
and
the
english
do
not
like
to
remember
that
holland
through
van
tromp
swept
them
off
the
seas
oh
i
remember
he
stuck
up
a
broom
on
the
mast
cut
in
phil
but
it
was
long
ago
how
is
it
that
the
tombs
of
william
and
grotius
can
be
in
a
church
i
reflected
aloud
it
is
newer
than
the
other
for
it
was
founded
in
thirteen
hundred
and
something
said
cousin
robert
i
suppose
you
ought
to
see
it
even
if
dinner
should
be
late
for
as
brederode
says
is
the
heart
of
holland
and
the
new
church
is
the
core
of
that
heart
it
is
for
us
what
your
westminster
abbey
is
to
you
miss
rivers
we
went
out
from
the
old
convent
palace
with
its
arched
windows
and
narrow
doors
into
the
gold
and
green
light
of
the
delft
afternoon
in
the
street
outside
the
courtyard
stood
the
automobile
and
the
chauffeur
was
polishing
something
on
it
people
in
holland
seem
always
to
be
polishing
something
if
they
are
obliged
to
stand
still
for
a
moment
but
rudolph
brederode
alias
william
the
silent
had
vanished
and
i
was
glad
we
got
into
the
again
passing
with
every
few
yards
some
beautiful
old
building
but
one
thing
in
delft
disappointed
me
i
saw
no
storks
and
i
expected
the
air
to
be
dark
with
storks
i
do
think
there
are
any
now
said
robert
apologetically
though
brederode
would
know
is
it
true
that
the
stork
the
patron
saint
of
delft
i
asked
was
it
here
you
had
the
fire
which
nearly
ruined
the
city
hundreds
of
years
ago
and
the
parent
storks
would
leave
their
babies
but
died
covering
them
up
with
their
wings
and
did
holland
take
the
stork
after
that
for
a
kind
of
of
motto
for
the
whole
country
because
it
was
so
brave
and
faithful
yes
robert
admitted
delft
is
not
tired
of
storks
but
storks
are
tired
of
delft
you
can
offer
them
nice
nests
on
long
poles
and
all
kinds
of
inducements
to
live
in
a
certain
place
but
unless
they
choose
you
can
not
make
them
do
anything
ah
i
know
why
the
dutch
have
canonized
storks
i
exclaimed
and
just
then
we
arrived
at
the
new
church
which
looked
inconceivably
old
and
inside
was
like
a
vast
prison
but
the
tomb
of
black
and
white
marble
was
fine
almost
too
fine
too
much
encrusted
with
ornament
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
william
the
silent
still
i
felt
a
thrill
as
i
stood
looking
at
the
white
recumbent
figure
of
the
man
who
made
holland
and
altered
the
face
of
europe
resting
so
quietly
after
the
storms
of
life
with
his
dog
at
his
feet
the
loyal
little
beast
who
saved
him
at
malines
and
starved
to
death
in
the
end
rather
than
live
on
in
a
dull
world
empty
of
its
master
i
lingered
for
many
minutes
remembering
the
eyes
of
the
portrait
so
warm
with
life
and
power
and
phil
had
to
come
and
lead
me
away
to
the
tomb
of
hugo
grotius
the
miracle
of
europe
even
robert
grew
warm
on
the
subject
of
grotius
and
put
him
ahead
of
pitt
as
the
youthful
prodigy
of
the
world
what
had
he
left
unaccomplished
when
he
was
eighteen
and
what
story
had
ever
been
written
by
dumas
or
any
other
to
compare
with
his
in
melodramatic
interest
i
did
know
enough
details
of
the
brilliant
being
history
to
argue
although
i
have
always
the
most
intense
yearning
to
argue
with
cousin
robert
but
i
made
a
note
to
read
them
up
in
case
i
should
ever
be
called
upon
to
write
a
historical
novel
at
short
notice
robert
discouraged
phil
from
buying
the
ware
of
delft
on
its
native
heath
and
we
spun
along
twice
as
fast
in
leaving
the
town
as
we
had
in
coming
either
because
a
dutchman
is
sacred
or
because
this
particular
dutchman
was
anxious
to
exchange
our
society
for
that
of
his
fiancée
we
flew
over
the
smooth
klinker
road
at
such
a
rate
that
had
it
been
england
a
policeman
would
have
sprung
from
every
bush
nobody
seemed
to
mind
here
however
and
the
few
horses
we
met
had
the
air
of
turning
up
their
noses
at
us
despite
the
physical
difficulty
in
evoking
that
expression
on
an
equine
profile
the
country
grew
prettier
it
was
the
sort
of
landscape
artists
used
to
produce
out
of
their
abundant
imagination
scorning
to
be
tied
down
by
models
dashing
in
anything
charming
or
which
they
happened
to
think
of
at
the
moment
and
jumbling
together
an
extravagant
whole
too
good
to
be
true
but
there
were
only
a
few
miles
of
it
left
after
delft
and
we
had
reveled
in
impossibly
delicious
and
supernaturally
bowery
gardens
half
long
enough
when
we
ran
into
the
outskirts
of
the
hague
gravenhage
as
i
love
to
call
it
to
myself
until
this
moment
i
been
mentally
patronizing
holland
admiring
it
and
wondering
at
it
of
course
but
saying
that
quaintness
snugness
and
historical
interest
were
all
we
could
expect
of
the
low
country
elegance
and
beauty
of
form
we
must
look
for
but
i
found
myself
surrounded
by
it
in
the
hague
there
were
streets
of
tall
brown
palaces
far
finer
than
the
royal
dwelling
which
robert
pointed
out
the
shops
made
me
long
to
spring
from
the
car
and
spend
every
penny
set
apart
for
the
tour
the
binnenhof
that
sinister
theater
of
dutch
history
with
its
strangely
grouped
towers
and
palaces
and
its
huge
squares
made
me
feel
an
insignificant
insect
with
no
right
to
opinions
of
any
kind
and
as
i
gazed
up
at
the
dark
medieval
buildings
vague
visions
of
cornelis
and
john
de
witt
in
their
torture
of
van
oldenbarneveld
and
fair
adelaide
de
poelgust
stabbed
and
bleeding
flitted
fearfully
through
my
brain
i
wanted
to
get
out
and
look
for
the
stone
where
adelaide
had
fallen
to
die
how
well
i
remembered
that
story
told
in
twilight
and
firelight
by
my
father
and
only
the
set
of
robert
shoulders
deterred
me
what
was
a
romantic
fragment
of
history
compared
to
the
certainty
that
the
roast
would
be
overdone
but
when
we
swept
into
the
dusk
of
the
forest
i
forgot
such
trivialities
as
buildings
made
by
man
suddenly
we
were
in
a
different
world
an
old
old
world
with
magic
that
lurked
in
each
dusky
vista
breathed
from
the
perfume
of
leaf
and
fern
and
whispered
in
the
music
of
the
trees
as
if
we
had
strayed
upon
the
road
that
leads
to
fairyland
fancy
seeing
fairyland
from
the
i
said
to
myself
i
never
thought
to
go
in
such
a
fashion
though
i
been
sure
that
one
day
or
another
i
would
find
the
way
there
through
such
a
forest
as
this
i
felt
that
if
i
walked
here
alone
i
might
see
something
more
mysterious
than
than
giant
beeches
and
ancient
oaks
than
glints
of
waters
shining
out
of
shadow
in
green
darkness
deep
and
cool
than
rustic
bridges
twined
with
creepers
or
kiosks
glimmering
at
the
end
of
long
straight
alleys
i
should
have
seen
processions
of
dim
figures
chanting
druids
and
their
victims
wild
fierce
warriors
and
women
their
white
arms
and
the
gold
of
their
long
hair
shining
through
the
mist
of
centuries
but
then
i
was
in
the
and
though
robert
in
a
different
and
more
sketchy
costume
would
have
been
a
gallant
batavian
warrior
there
would
be
a
certain
indecorousness
in
permitting
my
fancy
to
make
the
necessary
changes
i
had
to
content
myself
therefore
with
things
as
they
were
with
the
of
the
automobile
instead
of
the
wild
wailing
of
druids
and
with
the
coming
and
going
of
modern
carriages
under
the
shadowy
branches
instead
of
strange
chariots
of
bygone
kings
after
all
we
did
not
find
but
merely
when
we
flashed
out
from
the
mysterious
heart
of
the
forest
but
the
villas
were
charming
scattered
in
the
woods
ringed
with
flowery
lawns
and
not
one
without
a
huge
veranda
like
a
fitted
up
with
so
many
cushioned
sofas
and
little
tables
that
it
was
clear
the
family
life
was
lived
there
i
do
hope
my
dutch
cousin
house
at
scheveningen
is
as
pretty
as
these
i
said
to
myself
it
would
be
delicious
to
visit
in
a
but
presently
we
slipped
out
of
the
shade
into
sunlight
and
were
in
a
town
of
brick
streets
huge
hotels
with
flags
all
in
a
spanking
breeze
gay
little
shops
and
houses
such
as
grow
up
by
the
sea
it
was
scheveningen
i
blinked
in
the
blaze
of
sunlight
which
tore
open
the
green
veil
of
dusk
and
the
air
though
tingling
with
ozone
felt
hot
after
the
depths
of
the
forest
not
a
flower
not
a
garden
was
to
be
seen
yet
scheveningen
was
a
of
color
in
itself
where
the
color
came
from
you
could
scarcely
say
yet
it
struck
at
your
eyes
from
all
directions
flags
flamed
roofs
were
red
as
beds
of
geraniums
or
else
they
were
green
or
else
they
were
vivid
yellow
the
hotels
were
of
quaint
design
with
a
suggestion
of
the
oriental
the
shops
had
covered
galleries
and
the
people
moving
in
the
big
circular
into
which
we
drove
the
of
the
kurhaus
and
of
the
circus
were
drifting
particles
of
the
bright
mosaic
tall
dark
young
officers
not
at
all
typically
dutch
according
to
preconceived
ideas
in
green
and
crimson
or
bright
blue
uniforms
pretty
girls
in
white
with
or
scarlet
hats
nursemaids
in
the
costume
of
some
remote
province
the
sunlight
setting
their
gold
on
fire
tiny
children
in
blue
or
with
a
little
red
fez
on
a
yellow
head
old
gentlemen
holding
on
unsuitable
as
they
walked
against
the
wind
waiters
flitting
about
restaurant
verandas
carrying
pink
ices
or
baskets
of
fruit
like
jewels
it
was
a
gay
scene
but
robert
said
it
was
nothing
to
the
high
season
which
began
on
the
first
of
august
and
brought
throngs
of
fashionable
people
from
all
over
europe
as
for
the
at
which
i
laughed
he
defended
them
stoutly
saying
they
were
as
much
at
the
hague
as
in
london
and
he
could
see
nothing
comic
in
wearing
them
at
the
seaside
still
we
had
had
no
glimpse
of
the
sea
but
robert
turned
the
car
and
driving
between
two
gigantic
hotels
ran
down
to
a
beach
with
sands
of
gleaming
gold
and
a
background
of
dunes
billowing
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
very
wildness
of
this
background
gave
a
bizarre
sort
of
charm
to
the
fantastic
buildings
which
made
up
the
fashionable
center
of
scheveningen
in
the
center
the
kurhaus
dominated
all
hotel
restaurant
theater
in
one
terrace
below
terrace
it
descended
and
sent
out
into
the
green
water
of
the
north
sea
a
great
pier
blossoming
with
flags
but
the
most
individual
feature
was
the
large
and
enterprising
family
of
wind
stoels
dear
cozy
for
one
like
green
and
yellow
cut
in
half
or
giant
sunbonnets
crowding
the
beach
behind
the
there
one
could
nestle
as
a
in
a
shell
defying
east
wind
or
baking
sun
happy
with
a
book
or
the
person
one
liked
best
in
a
twin
opposite
reposeful
gaiety
seemed
at
this
first
glance
to
be
the
note
struck
by
scheveningen
and
the
air
was
buoyant
as
i
had
never
known
air
to
be
before
if
you
visit
us
in
august
said
robert
you
will
hear
the
best
operas
see
the
best
automobile
races
the
most
exciting
races
but
we
shall
be
on
our
own
in
august
said
i
i
do
not
think
so
you
will
perhaps
let
your
boat
we
will
talk
to
my
mother
robert
answered
as
one
soothes
a
fractious
child
then
before
i
had
breath
to
answer
he
swept
us
away
from
the
beach
and
drew
up
before
an
aggressively
comfortable
villa
on
a
terrace
opening
to
the
sea
vi
there
was
a
with
walls
and
japanese
furniture
and
silk
things
and
in
the
stood
cousin
mother
the
great
glass
doors
were
wide
open
and
she
moved
slowly
to
the
threshold
to
meet
us
yes
she
is
far
too
large
to
come
and
call
upon
a
stranger
far
far
too
large
for
the
i
saw
in
a
flash
why
robert
put
the
family
before
the
most
important
historical
events
which
helped
to
make
holland
if
his
jaw
is
square
enough
his
gray
eyes
piercing
enough
to
make
his
mother
feel
it
convenient
to
entertain
unknown
guests
whatever
her
plans
and
inclinations
there
no
doubt
that
her
personality
is
more
than
commanding
enough
to
exact
respect
for
domestic
arrangements
it
would
need
such
a
giant
as
robert
not
to
be
overawed
by
her
outside
domestic
matters
and
as
for
myself
though
her
pretty
smooth
gray
hair
parts
in
the
middle
and
her
cheeks
grew
as
pink
as
a
baby
when
she
smiled
and
told
me
in
nice
english
to
call
her
cousin
cornelia
i
knew
that
if
she
said
black
were
white
i
would
instantly
agree
with
her
there
are
glass
doors
between
the
and
a
behind
they
were
closed
because
the
dutch
i
am
already
learning
like
to
draw
a
firm
dividing
line
between
being
in
the
house
and
in
the
open
air
and
i
could
see
through
the
glass
a
portrait
of
a
humorous
little
brown
gentleman
who
was
no
doubt
cousin
late
husband
and
robert
father
taking
this
for
granted
it
evident
that
robert
gets
his
inches
and
his
blond
splendor
of
looks
from
his
mother
there
was
so
much
of
cousin
cornelia
in
her
black
and
white
spotted
muslin
that
at
first
i
was
conscious
of
her
presence
alone
it
was
only
her
rich
voice
like
devonshire
cream
all
in
soft
lumps
when
the
english
words
were
difficult
introducing
freule
menela
van
der
windt
and
your
two
cousins
lisbeth
and
lilli
which
made
me
aware
that
others
were
present
i
turned
to
the
fiancée
first
and
found
her
a
dark
thin
girl
with
that
pinched
her
nose
and
perhaps
her
temper
as
well
for
there
is
a
line
of
her
face
which
wo
be
when
she
is
old
she
looked
hard
through
her
glasses
at
me
and
at
phil
taking
stock
of
us
both
and
did
offer
to
shake
hands
but
lisbeth
and
lilli
adorable
girls
twins
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
put
out
dimpled
fingers
cousin
cornelia
asked
how
we
liked
holland
but
without
waiting
for
us
to
answer
told
off
lisbeth
and
lilli
to
show
us
our
room
as
there
was
only
just
time
to
wash
away
the
dust
of
motoring
i
was
awestruck
by
cousin
cornelia
and
depressed
by
menela
still
i
hugged
the
thought
that
we
were
in
luck
to
see
the
inside
of
a
dutch
home
and
determined
to
make
the
most
of
our
experience
which
may
not
occur
again
i
never
supposed
it
possible
for
the
interior
of
a
house
to
shine
as
this
does
everything
shines
even
things
that
no
one
expects
to
present
a
polished
surface
for
instance
does
anybody
not
dutch
call
upon
walls
to
behave
as
if
they
were
mirrors
yet
as
i
went
up
the
rather
steep
stairs
of
the
villa
van
buren
i
could
see
each
movement
i
made
each
rise
and
fall
of
an
eyelash
repeated
on
a
surface
of
brilliantly
varnished
walnut
what
wonderful
wood
i
exclaimed
it
is
not
real
it
is
paint
said
pretty
lisbeth
do
you
not
have
walls
like
this
never
i
replied
every
one
does
in
holland
we
admire
them
explained
lilli
but
what
a
lot
of
work
to
keep
them
so
bright
it
is
only
done
once
a
day
she
said
apologetically
the
servant
does
it
when
she
has
finished
the
windows
what
all
the
windows
in
the
house
every
day
how
else
would
they
be
clean
asked
lisbeth
surprised
there
was
no
answer
to
this
from
a
dutch
point
of
view
so
i
remarked
meekly
that
it
must
take
all
the
servant
time
it
is
what
they
like
said
lilli
but
we
have
another
woman
for
the
floors
and
beating
out
the
rugs
and
doing
the
brass
so
it
is
not
so
much
floors
and
rugs
and
brass
every
day
too
of
course
returned
both
girls
together
as
if
i
had
asked
them
about
their
baths
or
their
lisbeth
opened
the
door
of
a
front
room
on
the
second
floor
this
is
the
spare
room
said
she
and
advanced
cautiously
through
the
dusk
caused
by
the
closing
of
the
shutters
we
keep
them
so
in
the
afternoon
she
explained
because
of
the
sunshine
yes
otherwise
the
room
would
be
hot
i
suppose
we
do
not
mind
its
being
hot
it
is
because
the
sun
would
fade
the
carpet
and
the
curtains
she
threw
open
the
blinds
as
she
spoke
but
carefully
shut
both
windows
again
oh
may
we
have
them
open
i
ventured
to
ask
the
air
is
lovely
if
you
like
my
cousin
replied
only
if
you
do
the
sand
may
blow
in
just
at
the
top
then
at
the
top
i
have
not
seen
a
window
that
opens
at
the
top
we
do
not
have
them
made
so
how
funny
but
i
suppose
there
must
be
a
reason
why
a
whole
nation
should
go
on
having
windows
that
wo
open
at
the
top
i
do
not
know
except
that
we
have
always
had
them
like
that
so
probably
it
is
better
to
go
on
said
lilli
after
a
few
reflection
during
which
she
looked
exceedingly
charming
she
and
lisbeth
made
no
attempt
at
having
figures
but
their
faces
are
perfect
and
their
long
tails
of
hair
are
fair
and
glossy
as
the
silk
of
american
corn
when
the
twins
left
us
to
our
own
devices
i
was
for
simply
washing
hands
and
faces
but
phil
fiercely
tore
off
her
blouse
and
made
herself
pink
with
the
effort
of
unearthing
another
from
our
box
what
does
it
matter
about
changing
i
asked
there
no
time
and
they
do
expect
it
besides
our
things
are
as
good
as
theirs
except
miss
van
der
windt
very
smart
to
make
up
for
her
plainness
that
just
the
point
said
phil
struggling
into
a
white
medallioned
blouse
that
fastened
as
intricately
as
the
working
of
a
prize
puzzle
i
taken
a
dislike
to
her
and
she
to
us
how
do
you
know
i
ca
tell
how
but
i
do
know
and
i
want
our
frocks
to
be
prettier
than
hers
change
like
a
pet
i
hook
you
up
if
you
do
me
come
you
you
bring
me
abroad
oh
all
right
so
i
changed
and
by
dint
of
supernatural
speed
we
were
ready
to
leave
our
doll
bedroom
just
as
a
japanese
gong
moaned
an
apology
for
supplying
us
with
dinner
instead
of
tea
once
in
a
blue
moon
phil
and
i
are
invited
by
some
one
to
dine
at
the
carlton
or
the
savoy
or
at
houses
where
the
dinners
are
long
and
elaborate
but
memories
of
those
dinners
pale
before
the
reality
of
this
at
the
villa
van
buren
in
a
handsome
there
were
and
shell
fish
and
soup
and
another
kind
of
fish
and
after
that
began
a
long
procession
of
meat
and
birds
cooked
in
delicious
rich
sauces
there
were
so
many
that
i
lost
count
as
noah
must
when
he
stood
at
the
ark
door
to
receive
the
animals
as
they
came
along
two
by
two
but
these
were
a
little
easier
to
keep
track
of
because
you
could
remind
yourself
by
saying
that
was
the
one
done
up
in
currant
juice
that
was
the
one
with
compote
of
cherries
and
so
on
which
of
course
noah
could
phil
capacity
and
mine
was
exhausted
comparatively
early
in
the
feast
but
everybody
else
was
eating
steadily
on
so
we
dared
not
refuse
a
course
lest
it
should
be
considered
rude
in
holland
we
did
our
best
straight
through
to
a
wonderful
iced
pudding
and
managed
a
crumb
of
spiced
cheese
but
when
raw
currants
appeared
we
had
to
draw
the
line
the
others
called
them
bessen
pulling
the
red
beads
off
their
stems
with
a
fork
and
sprinkling
them
with
sugar
but
my
blood
curdled
at
the
sight
of
this
dreadful
fruit
and
my
mouth
crinkled
up
inside
although
we
sat
down
at
six
it
was
after
eight
when
we
rose
and
as
the
windows
were
shut
the
room
was
suffocating
everybody
looked
flushed
and
i
dared
not
hope
after
excluding
the
air
for
so
long
that
we
should
be
allowed
a
breath
of
it
later
but
cousin
cornelia
as
a
matter
of
course
led
the
way
into
the
where
lamps
shaded
with
silk
had
now
been
lighted
on
two
of
the
tables
the
strong
air
of
the
sea
blew
blessedly
upon
us
seeming
cold
after
the
heat
of
the
but
cousin
cornelia
did
not
even
wrap
a
shawl
about
her
shoulders
we
were
now
and
it
was
right
to
have
air
so
you
took
it
for
granted
and
did
not
suffer
but
indoors
what
were
windows
for
if
you
did
not
keep
them
closed
it
seemed
a
waste
of
good
material
and
therefore
a
tempting
of
providence
to
take
revenge
by
sending
you
bronchitis
or
rheumatism
it
was
exquisite
in
the
sea
and
sky
mingled
in
a
haze
of
tender
blue
all
the
air
was
blue
spangled
with
the
lights
of
the
pier
and
our
lamps
and
the
shaded
lamps
of
other
glowed
in
the
azure
dusk
like
burning
flowers
roses
and
daffodils
and
tulips
we
had
coffee
in
cups
small
and
delicate
as
and
the
old
silver
spoons
were
spoons
for
dolls
or
fairies
robert
asked
if
we
would
like
to
go
to
the
circus
which
could
not
he
said
be
surpassed
in
europe
or
to
a
classical
concert
at
the
kurhaus
but
we
were
contented
in
the
with
the
music
of
the
sea
we
talked
of
many
things
and
if
robert
is
deficient
in
a
knowledge
of
history
the
others
make
up
for
his
ignorance
they
know
something
of
everything
and
even
the
twins
could
put
phyllis
and
me
to
shame
if
they
were
not
too
polite
on
the
subject
of
modern
musicians
and
painters
they
speak
french
german
and
italian
as
well
as
english
a
smattering
of
spanish
too
yet
they
said
modestly
when
we
exclaimed
at
their
accomplishments
that
it
was
nothing
hardly
anybody
would
learn
dutch
so
the
dutch
must
learn
the
languages
of
other
nations
as
for
freule
menela
i
must
not
call
her
miss
it
seems
because
freule
is
a
kind
of
title
she
is
the
cleverest
of
all
as
the
sweet
twins
tried
to
make
us
understand
and
the
pretty
creatures
are
proud
of
her
thinking
little
of
their
own
beauty
sometimes
i
fancied
that
a
shade
of
contempt
passed
over
her
face
when
robert
ventured
a
remark
which
showed
him
more
accomplished
as
sportsman
than
scholar
but
if
she
noticed
that
he
turned
to
phil
or
me
with
any
brightening
of
interest
she
at
once
took
pains
to
engage
his
attention
they
talked
in
low
pleasant
voices
scarcely
raising
their
tones
or
making
a
gesture
and
there
was
always
that
faint
suggestion
of
the
scotch
accent
whether
they
spoke
english
or
broke
into
dutch
when
i
remarked
upon
it
cousin
cornelia
laughed
and
said
it
was
perhaps
the
common
celtic
ancestry
and
that
if
the
dutch
heard
gaelic
talked
they
could
recognize
a
few
words
here
and
there
it
was
not
more
than
an
hour
after
we
finished
our
coffee
that
tea
was
brought
with
more
beautiful
china
and
a
great
deal
of
handsome
silver
what
with
this
potent
mixture
of
stimulants
and
being
in
a
new
house
and
thinking
exciting
thoughts
of
the
future
i
felt
i
should
be
able
to
sleep
nevertheless
after
we
said
and
phil
and
i
were
undressing
i
was
not
pleased
when
cousin
cornelia
knocked
at
the
door
she
has
come
about
the
i
thought
to
tell
us
we
to
go
heaven
grant
me
strength
to
resist
for
in
her
quilted
japanese
silk
she
looked
larger
and
more
formidable
than
ever
not
a
word
did
she
say
about
the
at
first
it
was
our
past
which
seemed
to
interest
her
not
our
future
as
a
relation
she
has
the
right
to
ask
me
things
about
myself
and
phil
history
is
inextricably
tangled
up
with
mine
she
wanted
to
know
where
we
lived
in
london
and
how
also
on
what
though
she
did
put
it
as
crudely
as
that
i
was
frank
and
told
her
about
my
serial
stories
and
phil
typing
i
suppose
you
think
we
mad
to
break
up
our
work
and
go
on
a
tour
in
holland
as
if
we
were
millionaires
when
really
we
poor
girls
i
said
before
she
had
time
to
reprove
us
but
we
have
each
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
whatever
happens
so
it
is
as
desperate
as
you
might
think
besides
it
is
going
to
be
time
of
our
lives
even
my
stepsister
feels
so
now
though
she
was
against
it
at
first
and
neither
of
us
would
give
it
up
for
anything
i
do
think
you
should
give
it
up
said
cousin
cornelia
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
quite
a
small
one
for
in
her
note
she
had
said
we
must
come
and
let
her
offer
us
good
advice
before
it
was
too
late
and
robert
had
hinted
that
his
mother
meant
to
dissuade
us
from
our
chase
in
the
company
of
starr
and
aunt
i
think
you
know
how
to
take
care
of
yourselves
she
went
on
and
we
have
a
chaperon
phil
assured
her
so
i
have
heard
from
my
son
i
have
great
faith
in
the
scotch
yes
as
you
have
been
a
little
too
and
promised
this
strange
young
man
it
is
necessary
that
somebody
should
have
an
aunt
otherwise
if
you
two
had
been
quite
alone
together
it
would
not
so
much
have
mattered
in
holland
girls
have
liberty
more
than
anywhere
except
in
america
the
bicycle
is
their
chaperon
for
all
young
girls
and
men
bicycle
with
us
the
might
have
been
your
chaperon
even
if
the
aunt
should
not
come
perhaps
the
nephew
could
be
got
rid
of
and
a
way
arranged
rather
than
give
up
your
tour
we
were
delighted
and
i
could
have
hugged
cousin
cornelia
indeed
i
did
thank
her
warmly
and
was
rather
surprised
that
phil
who
usually
overflows
with
gratitude
for
the
slightest
kindness
was
not
more
effusive
over
my
relative
interest
in
our
affairs
and
her
verdict
she
a
lamb
after
all
is
she
i
asked
when
the
large
lady
had
gone
and
i
was
ready
to
creep
into
a
bed
only
an
inch
too
short
for
me
she
may
be
a
lamb
but
she
is
going
to
let
us
shear
her
if
she
can
help
it
said
phil
looking
deadly
wise
what
you
mean
my
dear
girl
with
all
your
cleverness
you
only
a
baby
child
about
some
things
you
see
what
she
driving
at
i
shook
my
head
with
my
hair
about
my
face
or
what
all
her
questions
were
leading
up
to
well
then
what
you
think
has
made
her
change
her
mind
about
our
she
saw
we
could
take
care
of
ourselves
she
has
found
out
that
we
poor
and
obliged
to
she
supposed
from
what
your
cousin
robert
told
her
that
we
were
heiresses
and
she
would
have
kept
us
on
a
long
visit
if
oh
you
silly
old
dear
do
you
see
she
afraid
of
us
with
she
be
polite
and
nice
but
she
wants
us
to
disappear
good
gracious
pretty
lilli
told
me
this
evening
that
freule
menela
van
der
windt
has
much
money
but
she
comes
of
a
splendid
family
she
a
distant
relation
of
that
brederode
and
her
people
are
diplomats
who
live
at
the
hague
though
she
an
orphan
and
visits
about
if
one
of
us
were
rich
why
oh
it
too
horrid
to
go
on
now
maybe
you
understand
what
i
mean
and
can
put
two
and
two
together
and
agree
with
me
for
a
saint
you
sometimes
develop
a
hideous
amount
of
worldly
wisdom
my
phil
i
replied
but
when
i
come
to
think
cousin
cornelia
over
afraid
you
right
it
would
be
fun
to
with
robert
and
frighten
her
would
it
we
are
going
away
to
the
and
we
shall
never
see
him
again
said
phil
besides
it
wrong
to
flirt
even
with
foreigners
and
now
do
let
me
say
my
prayers
vii
next
morning
when
i
waked
up
and
cautiously
drew
my
watch
from
under
the
pillow
not
to
disturb
phyllis
it
was
only
six
and
there
was
phil
gazing
at
me
with
eyes
large
and
bright
in
the
green
dusk
that
filtered
through
the
olive
curtains
i
been
awake
for
ages
said
she
what
are
you
thinking
about
the
queer
but
i
ca
help
it
neither
can
i
can
you
go
to
sleep
again
no
can
you
not
i
let
get
up
and
creep
out
of
doors
what
fun
to
go
down
to
the
beach
and
take
a
bath
nell
in
our
nighties
silly
we
hire
things
and
after
mature
deliberation
phil
decided
not
to
risk
being
taken
for
a
thief
by
the
van
buren
family
but
i
could
not
abandon
the
idea
and
fifteen
minutes
later
i
was
softly
unlocking
the
front
door
to
steal
alone
into
the
pearly
day
oh
the
wonder
of
it
the
wonder
of
each
new
day
if
one
only
stopped
to
think
but
the
wonder
of
this
above
all
others
already
there
were
a
few
people
about
hurrying
beachward
and
when
i
reached
the
level
of
the
firm
yellow
sand
there
were
the
men
of
the
in
full
activity
getting
their
horses
into
the
traces
while
dogs
raced
wildly
over
and
children
played
with
bright
shells
the
waves
had
flung
them
two
or
three
of
the
were
in
use
some
were
engaged
for
persons
not
yet
arrived
and
i
thought
myself
lucky
in
securing
one
drawn
by
the
handsomest
horse
of
all
the
others
were
dull
creatures
compared
to
him
indeed
he
was
far
too
fine
for
a
mere
and
had
a
lovely
cushiony
back
like
the
animals
on
which
beautiful
ladies
pirouet
in
circuses
i
longed
to
try
it
myself
when
my
shoes
and
stockings
were
off
just
as
i
had
got
into
the
prickly
blue
serge
costume
provided
by
the
management
i
heard
the
sound
of
stirring
military
music
played
not
far
away
by
a
brass
band
and
something
queer
happened
at
the
same
moment
the
machine
began
to
rock
as
if
there
were
an
earthquake
to
dart
forward
to
retreat
and
at
last
to
go
galloping
ahead
at
a
speed
to
suggest
that
in
a
sudden
fit
of
hallucination
it
had
persuaded
itself
it
was
a
that
horse
i
gasped
and
swaying
first
against
one
wall
then
against
the
other
scarcely
able
to
keep
my
feet
i
tore
the
door
open
and
peeped
out
if
i
had
not
been
frightened
i
should
have
laughed
for
it
was
plain
to
see
from
the
expression
of
that
cushiony
back
that
the
animal
was
merely
pretending
to
be
afraid
of
the
music
in
a
kittenish
wish
for
a
little
early
morning
fun
but
he
was
also
pretending
in
quite
a
manner
to
run
away
and
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
the
consequences
might
be
as
awkward
for
the
occupant
of
the
machine
as
if
the
jest
were
earnest
whoa
whoa
cried
a
voice
in
pursuit
and
splash
went
the
beast
into
the
surf
he
was
playing
that
he
was
a
now
and
enjoying
it
selfishly
without
a
thought
of
poor
me
in
the
horrid
tottery
little
box
that
would
be
knocked
over
by
a
big
wave
maybe
in
another
instant
in
a
welter
of
sand
and
salt
water
under
a
merry
horse
hoofs
i
clung
to
the
door
with
one
hand
and
the
frame
with
the
other
swinging
back
and
forth
on
the
threshold
with
abnormally
large
iron
shoes
flying
up
and
down
in
the
wet
green
foreground
and
the
whole
north
sea
towering
over
me
in
the
middle
distance
oh
but
a
very
near
middle
distance
i
wavered
in
mind
as
well
as
body
if
i
did
jump
out
now
this
minute
i
might
be
caught
and
pinned
like
a
mouse
in
a
trap
under
the
water
if
i
did
jump
the
horse
would
kick
me
and
the
wheels
of
the
machine
would
go
over
me
and
i
should
be
battered
as
well
as
drowned
before
anybody
could
fish
me
out
i
did
feel
horribly
alone
in
the
world
and
the
waves
looked
as
tall
as
transparent
green
skyscrapers
one
two
at
i
jump
i
was
saying
resolutely
between
chattering
teeth
when
a
head
came
toward
me
in
the
sea
it
came
on
top
of
a
wave
and
like
the
dear
little
cherubs
in
it
seemed
to
have
no
body
yet
i
recognized
it
and
felt
half
inclined
to
bow
salutation
o
caesar
from
one
about
to
die
only
it
would
have
seemed
ridiculous
to
bow
to
a
mere
passing
head
when
one
was
on
the
eve
of
being
swept
away
by
the
north
sea
phyllis
might
have
done
it
i
gave
a
short
shriek
and
then
it
appeared
that
the
head
had
full
control
of
the
wave
for
it
stopped
and
let
the
wave
rush
by
to
show
that
it
had
a
tall
brown
dripping
body
sketchily
clad
in
the
kind
of
thing
that
men
dare
to
call
a
it
did
not
seem
strange
at
the
time
that
william
the
silent
should
be
shot
from
a
wave
as
if
by
a
catapult
and
still
less
strange
that
without
a
word
he
should
seize
my
horse
by
the
head
and
stop
him
it
seemed
the
sort
of
thing
that
ought
to
happen
to
foreigners
traveling
in
holland
if
in
need
of
succor
oh
thank
you
so
much
i
heard
myself
saying
just
as
if
he
had
had
on
a
and
and
had
stopped
a
hansom
cab
for
me
in
bond
street
not
at
all
i
heard
him
reply
in
the
same
tone
then
suddenly
i
thought
of
stanley
in
the
desert
saying
livingstone
i
believe
and
my
bare
feet
and
his
dripping
hair
and
the
whole
scene
struck
me
so
quaintly
that
i
laughed
out
aloud
whereupon
he
smiled
a
wet
brown
smile
showing
white
teeth
i
having
hysterics
i
spluttered
with
my
mouth
full
of
spray
it
only
only
and
the
spray
choked
me
with
its
salt
of
course
said
william
the
silent
grave
again
and
so
like
the
portrait
that
i
felt
i
must
be
a
historical
character
acting
with
him
in
an
incident
forgotten
or
expurgated
by
motley
i
so
glad
i
came
i
saw
you
from
further
out
and
thought
something
was
wrong
but
it
all
right
now
yes
thank
you
i
said
meekly
why
you
an
you
dutch
to
the
backbone
he
answered
and
then
suddenly
conscious
perhaps
that
the
might
one
call
it
feature
he
had
mentioned
was
too
much
exposed
to
be
discussed
thus
lightly
he
changed
the
subject
here
your
man
he
said
quickly
and
forthwith
fell
to
scolding
in
vehement
dutch
the
unfortunate
wretch
who
had
waded
to
the
rescue
the
horse
made
sadder
if
not
wiser
by
blows
from
his
master
allowed
himself
to
be
backed
for
a
certain
distance
until
it
was
safe
for
me
to
descend
and
take
my
postponed
bath
i
had
but
time
to
bow
and
murmur
more
inane
thanks
to
receive
another
bow
and
polite
murmur
in
return
both
murmurs
being
drowned
by
the
sea
when
the
retrograde
movement
of
the
parted
me
and
my
living
he
stood
in
the
water
looking
after
us
long
enough
to
see
that
there
would
be
no
further
incidents
then
took
a
header
into
the
waves
again
i
not
sure
that
my
adventure
did
not
add
spice
to
the
salt
of
my
bath
anyhow
it
was
glorious
and
i
ran
back
to
the
villa
at
last
tingling
with
joy
of
life
in
time
to
be
let
in
by
a
maid
who
was
cleaning
the
it
was
seven
and
breakfast
was
at
eight
i
had
to
make
haste
with
my
toilet
but
luckily
there
are
few
tasks
which
be
accompanied
by
a
running
fire
of
chat
that
is
if
one
is
a
woman
so
i
had
told
everything
to
phyllis
by
the
time
i
had
begun
fastening
the
white
serge
frock
in
which
i
was
to
go
to
the
hague
and
the
just
then
the
japanese
gong
sent
forth
its
melancholy
wail
so
we
hurried
down
and
i
forgot
to
tell
phyllis
not
to
mention
the
incident
i
did
think
it
the
kind
of
incident
which
would
be
approved
by
the
van
buren
family
and
on
second
thoughts
i
did
approve
of
it
myself
hardly
were
we
comfortably
seated
at
the
table
however
when
phil
told
robert
what
a
part
his
friend
had
played
in
my
adventure
i
could
not
stop
her
and
when
i
was
called
upon
for
details
gave
them
rather
than
seem
to
be
secretive
we
must
be
thankful
that
brederode
was
taking
his
dip
early
said
robert
i
will
tell
him
this
afternoon
that
we
are
very
grateful
for
what
he
did
i
blushed
consciously
oh
you
i
asked
somehow
i
an
idea
he
think
it
stupid
of
me
to
have
mentioned
it
besides
maybe
it
your
friend
perhaps
it
was
some
one
who
looked
like
him
the
er
dress
was
so
different
and
i
had
hardly
seen
brederode
jonkheer
brederode
corrected
freule
menela
softly
i
broke
out
laughing
jonkheer
oh
do
forgive
me
but
it
sounds
so
funny
i
really
could
call
a
person
jonkheer
and
take
him
you
will
have
to
call
him
jonkheer
when
i
bring
him
to
the
box
after
he
has
finished
his
part
in
the
said
robert
there
is
no
one
who
looks
like
rudolph
brederode
so
it
must
have
been
he
you
can
see
this
afternoon
but
i
do
to
see
i
objected
crossly
for
i
felt
i
could
not
solemnly
and
adequately
thank
the
young
man
before
my
listening
relatives
for
popping
out
of
the
sea
in
his
microscopic
costume
and
coming
to
the
rescue
of
me
in
mine
i
had
squeaked
and
curled
up
my
toes
and
been
altogether
ridiculous
and
i
knew
we
should
at
best
burst
out
laughing
in
each
other
faces
which
would
astonish
the
van
buren
family
whoever
he
was
i
thanked
him
three
times
this
morning
and
enough
i
went
on
he
was
risking
his
life
you
know
and
really
and
truly
i
rather
not
meet
him
formally
if
you
do
mind
very
well
said
cousin
robert
looking
offended
and
turning
his
attention
to
breakfast
it
was
when
i
came
to
notice
it
the
oddest
breakfast
imaginable
yet
it
had
a
tempting
air
there
was
a
tiny
glass
vase
of
flowers
at
each
person
place
and
the
middle
of
the
table
was
occupied
by
a
china
hen
sitting
on
her
nest
the
eggs
which
she
protected
were
and
ranged
round
the
nest
were
platters
of
every
kind
of
cold
smoked
meat
and
cold
smoked
fish
dreamed
of
in
the
philosophy
of
cooks
there
was
also
cold
ham
and
there
were
crisp
rich
little
rusks
and
gingerbread
in
japanese
tin
boxes
to
eat
with
honey
in
an
open
glass
dish
and
there
was
coffee
fit
for
gods
and
goddesses
even
phil
drank
it
though
she
was
offered
tea
excusing
her
treachery
by
saying
that
she
found
her
tastes
were
changing
to
suit
the
climate
of
holland
a
dangerous
theory
since
who
can
tell
to
what
wild
lengths
it
may
lead
when
we
had
finished
the
was
taken
from
its
place
in
front
of
cousin
cornelia
and
another
tray
bearing
two
large
china
bowls
of
hot
water
a
dish
with
soap
a
toy
mop
with
a
carved
wood
handle
and
two
towels
was
substituted
for
it
i
wash
the
fine
china
and
the
myself
after
breakfast
explained
cousin
cornelia
slipping
off
her
rings
and
beginning
her
pretty
task
the
best
of
servants
are
not
as
careful
as
their
mistresses
and
it
is
a
custom
in
holland
but
you
did
wash
the
and
last
night
after
dinner
i
reminded
her
no
she
replied
i
never
do
that
but
is
the
china
as
valuable
and
is
there
as
much
danger
of
being
broken
she
looked
puzzled
almost
distressed
yes
that
is
true
she
admitted
but
it
is
not
a
custom
i
do
know
why
but
it
never
has
been
her
housewifely
pleasure
was
spoiled
for
the
moment
and
i
wished
that
i
had
spoken
after
all
lisbeth
and
lilli
were
not
to
go
with
us
to
the
hague
this
was
the
morning
for
opening
the
curio
cabinets
in
the
and
washing
the
contents
and
the
girls
were
expected
to
help
their
mother
as
the
glass
doors
are
never
opened
unless
that
some
guest
may
carefully
handle
a
gold
a
miniature
or
a
bit
of
old
delft
the
things
could
scarcely
need
washing
but
the
rule
is
to
have
them
out
once
a
month
and
it
would
be
a
crime
to
break
it
this
freule
menela
explained
in
a
low
voice
and
with
the
suspicion
of
a
smile
as
if
she
wished
the
two
girls
from
london
to
understand
that
she
was
able
to
see
the
humorous
side
of
these
things
your
cousins
are
she
went
on
though
dear
people
known
them
since
i
was
a
child
and
am
fond
of
them
for
their
own
sakes
as
well
as
robert
you
must
not
think
that
everybody
in
our
country
dines
at
five
for
instance
if
you
visited
in
my
set
at
the
hague
you
would
find
things
more
as
they
are
in
france
when
robert
and
i
are
married
shall
manage
the
house
we
listened
civilly
but
liked
her
none
the
better
for
her
disavowal
of
van
buren
ways
horrid
snobbish
disloyal
little
wretch
said
phil
afterwards
quite
viciously
your
cousin
a
hundred
times
too
good
and
too
for
her
but
she
does
know
that
she
fancies
herself
superior
and
thinks
she
condescending
to
ally
herself
with
the
family
i
do
believe
she
marrying
your
cousin
for
his
money
and
if
she
could
get
a
chance
to
do
better
according
to
her
ideas
she
throw
him
over
it
is
likely
she
ever
have
another
chance
of
any
sort
said
i
robert
wo
get
rid
of
his
bargain
easily
she
going
with
us
this
morning
and
makes
a
favor
of
it
went
on
phil
she
says
she
tired
to
death
of
the
pictures
but
i
sure
ten
wild
horses
would
keep
her
at
home
be
that
as
it
may
the
power
of
twenty
wild
horses
in
motor
form
rushed
her
away
in
our
society
and
that
of
her
fiancé
in
the
beautiful
forest
which
i
was
happy
in
seeing
again
we
threaded
intricate
dark
avenues
and
came
at
last
as
if
we
had
been
a
whole
party
of
tourist
princes
in
the
tale
of
the
sleeping
beauty
to
the
house
in
the
wood
the
romance
of
the
place
grew
in
my
eyes
because
a
princess
built
it
to
please
her
husband
and
because
the
husband
was
that
son
of
william
the
silent
who
best
carried
on
his
father
plans
for
holland
greatness
i
afraid
i
cared
more
about
it
for
the
sake
of
princess
amalia
and
frederic
henry
of
orange
than
for
the
sake
of
the
peace
conference
because
the
conference
was
modern
and
it
was
of
the
princess
i
thought
as
we
passed
through
room
after
room
of
the
charming
old
house
hidden
in
the
very
heart
of
the
forest
had
she
commanded
the
exquisite
chinese
embroideries
the
wonderful
decorations
from
china
and
japan
and
the
lovely
old
china
i
would
ask
for
if
she
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
part
i
did
wish
to
know
in
the
octagonal
orange
salon
where
the
powers
met
to
make
peace
and
where
the
walls
and
cupola
are
a
riot
of
paintings
in
praise
of
frederic
henry
and
his
relations
we
strained
our
necks
to
see
the
pictures
and
our
brains
to
recall
who
the
people
were
and
what
they
had
done
but
even
the
portrait
of
motley
which
we
just
passed
and
the
knowledge
that
he
wrote
in
this
very
house
did
not
always
prod
our
memories
robert
would
not
let
us
stay
long
at
the
house
in
the
wood
he
took
us
to
see
the
site
of
the
palace
of
peace
which
carnegie
money
and
a
little
of
other
people
will
build
and
then
flashed
us
on
to
the
hague
in
time
to
reach
the
mauritshuis
as
it
opened
robert
did
pretend
to
know
much
about
the
pictures
though
he
was
patriotically
proud
of
them
as
among
the
best
to
be
found
if
you
searched
the
world
but
the
fiancée
was
in
her
element
tired
to
death
of
these
splendid
things
she
might
be
in
her
small
soul
but
she
was
determined
to
impress
us
with
her
artistic
knowledge
i
know
exactly
where
all
the
best
pictures
are
she
said
motioning
away
the
official
guides
and
i
will
take
you
to
them
she
had
a
practical
energetic
air
and
her
black
eyes
were
sharp
behind
her
i
felt
i
could
not
be
introduced
by
her
to
the
glorious
company
of
great
men
and
basely
i
slipped
away
from
the
party
leaving
phil
to
follow
with
outward
humility
and
inward
rebellion
a
martyr
to
politeness
oh
how
glad
i
was
to
be
left
alone
with
the
pictures
with
nobody
to
tell
me
anything
about
them
i
flew
back
to
buy
a
catalogue
and
then
carefully
dodging
my
friends
whose
backs
i
spied
from
time
to
time
i
gave
myself
up
to
happiness
i
did
want
to
see
the
madonnas
and
nymphs
and
goddesses
and
italian
scenes
which
a
certain
school
conscientiously
produced
because
in
their
day
it
was
the
fashion
i
wanted
only
the
characteristically
dutch
artists
the
men
who
loved
their
dear
hollow
land
putting
her
beyond
all
glorifying
her
and
painting
what
they
knew
with
their
hearts
as
well
as
eyes
the
daily
life
of
home
the
rich
brown
dusk
of
humble
rooms
the
sea
the
sky
the
gentle
flat
landscape
the
pleasant
domestic
animals
my
acquaintance
with
dutch
art
was
made
in
london
at
the
national
gallery
now
i
wanted
to
see
it
at
home
and
understand
it
as
one
can
best
understand
it
here
i
soon
found
the
great
rembrandt
the
school
of
anatomy
and
stood
for
a
long
time
looking
at
the
wonderful
faces
faces
in
whose
eyes
each
thought
lay
clear
to
read
what
a
picture
a
man
who
had
done
nothing
else
all
his
life
long
but
paint
just
that
would
have
earned
the
right
to
be
immortal
but
to
have
been
only
when
he
did
it
and
then
to
have
gone
on
through
year
after
year
giving
the
world
masterpieces
and
to
be
repaid
by
that
world
in
the
end
with
poverty
and
hardship
my
cheeks
burned
as
i
stood
thinking
of
it
and
somehow
i
felt
guilty
and
responsible
as
if
i
lived
in
rembrandt
day
and
been
as
ungrateful
as
the
others
i
had
expected
to
be
disappointed
in
paul
potter
bull
because
people
always
speak
of
it
at
once
if
they
hear
you
are
going
to
holland
but
if
you
could
be
disappointed
in
that
young
and
winning
beast
who
kindly
stands
there
with
diamonds
in
his
great
velvet
eyes
and
the
breath
coming
and
going
under
his
rough
wholesome
coat
for
you
to
look
at
and
admire
when
all
the
time
you
know
that
he
could
kill
you
if
he
liked
why
you
would
deserve
to
be
gored
by
him
and
trodden
by
his
companions
how
i
wanted
to
have
known
jan
van
steen
and
thanked
him
for
his
glorious
rollicking
extraordinary
pictures
especially
for
the
poultry
yard
and
have
slyly
stolen
his
bottle
away
from
him
sometimes
so
that
he
might
have
painted
even
more
and
not
have
come
to
ruin
in
the
end
how
i
loved
the
gentle
van
ruysdaels
and
how
pathetic
the
everlasting
white
horse
got
to
seem
after
i
had
seen
him
repeated
again
and
again
in
every
sort
of
tender
or
eccentric
landscape
poor
tired
white
horse
i
thought
he
must
have
been
as
weary
of
his
journeyings
as
the
wandering
jew
there
are
two
rubens
in
the
mauritshuis
which
intoxicated
me
as
if
been
drinking
new
red
wine
and
there
is
one
little
gerard
douw
above
all
other
gerard
douws
worth
a
journey
on
foot
to
see
in
a
window
of
the
bull
room
i
found
it
and
i
stood
so
long
staring
that
at
last
i
began
to
be
afraid
the
others
might
have
gone
away
they
came
upon
me
though
all
too
soon
and
exclaimed
why
where
you
been
and
we
been
looking
for
you
i
said
i
was
sorry
and
wondered
how
i
had
been
so
stupid
as
to
miss
them
then
we
were
marshalled
away
by
robert
for
luncheon
as
we
been
three
hours
in
the
mauritshuis
and
before
long
we
must
be
driving
to
the
only
three
hours
in
some
of
the
best
society
on
earth
and
i
shall
be
expected
to
tell
about
my
impressions
when
i
go
back
to
england
i
know
well
that
i
can
tell
nothing
worth
telling
and
yet
even
in
this
short
time
i
feel
that
i
understand
more
about
holland
and
the
hollanders
than
i
could
have
come
to
understand
except
through
their
pictures
more
even
than
motley
could
have
told
me
i
said
to
myself
as
i
went
away
from
the
galleries
that
dutch
painting
would
stand
for
me
henceforth
as
an
epitome
of
the
dutch
people
no
one
but
the
dutch
could
have
painted
pictures
like
theirs
so
quaint
so
painstaking
and
at
the
same
time
so
splendid
their
love
of
rich
brown
shadow
and
amber
light
was
learned
in
the
dim
little
rooms
of
their
own
homes
and
of
inns
where
the
brass
and
pewter
gleamed
in
the
mellow
dusk
of
raftered
kitchens
and
piles
of
fruit
and
vegetables
fell
like
jewels
from
paniers
such
as
gerard
douw
took
three
days
to
paint
on
a
scale
of
three
inches
we
had
a
hasty
luncheon
at
a
nice
hotel
with
an
air
of
parisian
gaiety
about
it
and
sped
away
in
the
motor
to
the
horse
show
which
was
to
be
held
in
a
park
between
the
hague
and
scheveningen
it
was
advertised
on
every
wall
and
hoarding
even
on
and
freule
menela
gorgeous
in
a
paris
frock
and
tilted
hat
prophesied
that
as
the
queen
and
prince
consort
were
honoring
the
occasion
we
should
see
the
loveliest
women
handsomest
men
and
prettiest
dresses
as
well
as
the
best
horses
that
holland
could
produce
when
i
say
holland
i
mean
the
hague
it
is
the
same
thing
she
added
with
a
conceited
toss
of
the
chin
and
i
thought
she
deserved
shaking
for
her
sly
dig
at
robert
of
rotterdam
than
whom
there
can
be
no
handsomer
young
man
in
the
netherlands
cousin
cornelia
in
filmy
gray
and
the
twins
radiant
as
roses
in
their
white
frocks
and
leghorn
hats
had
arrived
and
were
in
one
of
the
many
long
open
loggias
close
to
the
pavilion
which
was
ready
for
the
royalties
over
the
pavilion
with
its
gilded
crown
and
crest
floated
the
orange
flag
as
well
as
the
tricolor
of
holland
everywhere
flags
were
waving
and
red
bunting
glowing
and
there
was
far
more
effect
of
color
than
at
an
english
every
box
every
seat
was
full
pretty
hats
nodded
like
flowers
in
a
huge
parterre
swept
by
a
breeze
men
with
women
in
trailing
white
walked
about
the
lawns
and
robert
and
menela
pointed
out
the
celebrities
ambassadors
and
ambassadors
wives
politicians
popular
actresses
celebrated
journalists
men
of
title
or
wealth
who
owned
horses
and
gave
their
lives
to
sport
all
the
men
of
the
were
in
and
tall
hats
and
most
of
them
looked
english
there
were
few
of
the
type
which
i
preconceived
as
dutch
yet
i
saw
faces
in
the
crowd
which
rembrandt
or
rubens
might
have
used
as
models
thin
dark
faces
hard
shrewd
faces
with
long
noses
and
pointed
chins
round
faces
with
gray
eyes
important
conceited
faces
like
the
burgomasters
in
ancient
portraits
not
a
type
has
changed
i
said
to
myself
these
people
of
are
the
same
people
who
suffered
torture
smiling
who
were
silent
on
the
rack
who
drove
the
spaniards
out
of
their
land
and
swept
the
english
from
the
seas
this
was
my
mood
when
a
stir
among
the
throng
heralded
the
coming
of
the
queen
and
i
applauded
as
patriotically
as
a
dutchwoman
the
young
daughter
of
the
brave
house
of
orange
and
nassau
she
had
a
fine
procession
and
made
an
effective
entrance
through
the
wide
gates
that
swung
apart
to
let
in
her
outriders
in
their
green
livery
and
the
royal
coaches
with
powdered
coachmen
and
footmen
in
blazing
red
and
gold
a
charming
young
woman
she
looked
too
in
her
blowing
white
cloud
of
chiffon
and
lace
and
while
she
circled
round
the
drive
with
her
suite
i
heard
the
dutch
national
hymn
for
the
first
time
and
also
a
soft
and
plaintive
air
which
is
the
queen
own
a
kind
of
entrance
music
which
follows
her
about
through
life
like
the
music
for
a
leading
actress
on
the
stage
when
the
queen
in
her
white
dress
the
stout
bland
prince
consort
in
his
blue
uniform
and
the
ladies
of
the
court
were
settled
under
the
crimson
curtains
of
the
pavilion
officers
who
were
competing
in
the
horse
show
hollanders
in
green
and
cerise
and
plain
blue
belgians
in
blue
and
red
two
or
three
danes
in
delicious
azure
were
brought
up
with
much
ceremony
to
be
introduced
there
goes
rudolph
brederode
said
robert
a
light
of
friendly
admiration
kindling
in
his
eyes
for
a
tall
slim
figure
in
black
coat
and
see
her
majesty
is
wishing
him
good
luck
he
but
my
cousin
glanced
at
me
and
remembering
my
base
ingratitude
decided
that
i
deserved
no
further
information
about
his
hero
who
ought
to
be
my
hero
too
i
pretended
not
to
hear
and
watched
the
show
of
beautiful
horses
and
carriages
they
went
round
and
round
the
great
grassy
ring
each
driver
and
some
of
them
were
english
taking
off
their
in
front
of
the
royal
pavilion
there
was
a
good
deal
of
this
kind
of
entertainment
but
the
best
part
of
the
show
was
saved
for
the
last
when
all
the
glittering
carriages
had
disappeared
from
the
course
then
came
the
jumping
competition
in
which
the
finest
riders
officers
and
civilians
were
to
prove
what
they
and
their
horses
could
do
the
crowd
had
wearied
of
the
long
driving
contests
but
as
the
dutch
soldiers
ran
out
across
the
grass
to
take
their
places
beside
the
hedges
hurdles
and
obstacles
there
was
a
general
brisking
up
then
began
the
real
excitement
of
the
afternoon
people
greeted
their
favorites
with
applause
and
cousin
robert
hero
had
the
largest
share
he
made
a
splendid
figure
on
his
delicately
shaped
roan
a
creature
all
and
muscle
like
his
master
graceful
as
a
cat
and
shining
in
the
sun
with
the
rich
effulgence
of
a
chestnut
fresh
from
the
burr
i
could
help
a
jumping
of
the
pulses
when
the
bell
rang
and
the
young
men
on
their
grand
horses
cantered
into
the
ring
rudolph
brederode
was
the
last
and
his
horse
came
in
on
its
hind
legs
pawing
and
prancing
with
sheer
joy
of
life
and
its
own
beauty
yet
what
a
different
beast
from
that
other
who
had
also
pirouetted
to
the
sound
of
music
in
the
morning
i
wondered
if
william
the
silent
thought
but
of
course
he
did
one
by
one
the
horses
started
urged
on
or
held
back
by
their
riders
all
rode
well
but
not
one
got
round
the
course
without
a
fault
a
jump
short
at
a
ditch
a
hind
hoof
that
brushed
a
hedge
the
ring
of
an
iron
shoe
on
a
hurdle
or
a
wooden
brick
sent
flying
from
the
top
row
on
a
high
wall
not
one
until
rudolph
brederode
turn
came
at
the
last
moment
a
pat
of
his
hand
on
his
horse
satin
shoulder
quieted
the
splendid
creature
nerves
instantly
it
was
calm
and
coming
down
from
fun
to
business
started
off
at
the
daintest
of
canters
which
broke
at
exactly
the
right
second
into
a
noble
bound
without
a
visible
effort
the
adorable
beast
rose
for
each
obstacle
floating
across
hedges
and
walls
as
if
it
had
been
borne
by
the
wings
of
pegasus
the
last
widest
was
taken
with
one
long
flying
leap
and
then
doffing
his
hat
low
to
the
royal
box
the
conqueror
rode
away
in
a
storm
of
applause
it
always
like
that
brederode
never
fails
in
anything
he
undertakes
said
robert
as
happy
as
if
he
and
not
his
friend
had
been
the
victor
i
off
to
congratulate
him
now
two
minutes
later
i
saw
the
hero
among
the
crowd
his
head
towering
above
most
other
heads
then
i
lost
sight
of
him
and
turned
again
to
watch
the
course
for
the
riding
was
not
nearly
finished
yet
but
with
the
triumph
of
the
great
water
beggar
descendant
the
best
was
over
no
one
else
did
as
well
as
he
or
had
as
fine
a
horse
and
i
found
myself
looking
for
him
and
robert
maybe
robert
would
bring
him
to
the
box
in
spite
of
all
it
was
a
pity
the
others
should
be
cheated
of
a
word
with
him
which
even
the
twins
seemed
to
hope
for
just
because
robert
had
to
punish
me
but
he
did
not
come
nor
did
robert
until
after
the
royalties
had
gone
and
cousin
cornelia
was
ready
to
go
too
rudolph
brederode
point
of
view
viii
i
do
often
do
things
that
i
have
set
my
mind
against
doing
but
when
destiny
lays
a
hand
on
one
unexpected
things
happen
my
idea
has
always
been
that
when
my
time
came
to
fall
seriously
in
love
the
girl
would
be
a
dutch
girl
i
like
and
respect
dutch
girls
when
you
want
them
there
they
are
there
no
nonsense
in
them
at
least
as
little
as
possible
considering
that
they
are
females
they
do
fuss
about
their
temperaments
and
imagine
themselves
mysteries
and
chameleons
and
anomalies
and
make
themselves
and
their
lovers
miserable
by
trying
to
be
inscrutable
you
can
generally
tell
pretty
well
what
they
are
going
to
do
next
and
if
you
do
want
them
to
you
can
prevent
them
from
doing
it
also
they
have
good
nerves
and
good
complexions
and
for
these
reasons
and
many
others
make
perfect
wives
for
men
with
family
traditions
to
keep
up
that
is
why
i
always
intended
to
fall
seriously
in
love
with
a
dutch
girl
although
my
mother
was
an
englishwoman
and
her
father
an
english
earl
who
thought
england
the
only
land
made
an
american
heiress
his
countess
more
than
once
i
come
near
to
carrying
out
my
intention
but
the
feeling
i
had
never
seemed
the
right
feeling
so
i
let
the
matter
drop
and
waited
for
next
time
a
few
days
ago
i
found
out
that
there
would
never
be
a
next
time
i
knew
this
when
rob
van
buren
spoke
of
the
two
girls
who
were
with
him
at
the
prinzenhof
on
july
tenth
as
his
american
cousin
and
an
english
friend
i
can
never
fall
in
love
with
a
dutch
girl
now
for
i
have
done
the
thing
i
did
not
mean
to
do
and
it
ca
be
undone
in
this
world
once
and
for
all
that
is
settled
however
it
may
go
with
me
where
the
girl
is
concerned
but
it
will
go
hard
if
i
do
not
have
her
in
the
end
and
i
shall
if
she
is
to
be
got
for
the
men
of
my
blood
soon
make
up
their
minds
when
they
want
a
thing
and
they
do
not
rest
much
until
theirs
this
peculiarity
has
often
landed
them
in
trouble
in
past
times
and
may
land
me
in
trouble
now
but
i
ready
for
the
risk
as
they
were
i
did
know
at
first
which
was
the
english
girl
girl
with
the
chestnut
hair
dark
hazel
eyes
and
rose
and
white
complexion
or
the
other
girl
with
brown
hair
eyes
of
violet
and
skin
of
cream
but
when
i
encountered
my
girl
in
the
sea
at
six
in
the
morning
unchaperoned
except
by
a
foolish
runaway
horse
attached
to
a
i
should
have
guessed
that
she
was
the
american
even
if
there
had
been
nothing
in
her
pretty
voice
to
suggest
it
i
am
sorry
that
it
could
have
been
the
other
way
round
for
my
english
mother
sake
since
my
fate
is
to
be
dutch
but
it
ca
be
helped
i
have
seen
the
one
girl
and
it
would
be
the
same
if
she
were
a
red
indian
i
was
going
to
lead
up
to
the
subject
when
van
buren
came
to
speak
to
me
at
the
horse
show
but
he
began
it
by
thanking
me
in
the
grave
way
he
has
for
coming
to
his
cousin
rescue
in
the
morning
i
should
have
referred
to
that
little
business
as
she
might
not
have
mentioned
her
adventure
but
as
she
had
told
the
story
it
gave
me
a
foundation
to
work
on
i
said
truly
that
what
i
had
done
was
nothing
but
hinted
that
i
should
be
pleased
to
meet
the
young
lady
again
and
thereupon
expected
an
invitation
to
visit
his
mother
box
to
my
surprise
it
did
come
and
robert
face
showed
that
there
was
a
reason
why
my
cousin
does
deserve
that
you
should
take
an
interest
in
her
he
blurted
out
she
is
pretty
yes
and
perhaps
that
is
why
she
is
so
spoiled
for
she
is
vain
and
capricious
and
flippant
i
wish
it
were
miss
rivers
who
had
our
blood
in
her
veins
queerly
enough
instead
of
cooling
me
off
toward
the
girl
criticism
of
her
had
the
opposite
effect
i
have
liked
robert
since
i
took
him
under
my
wing
during
my
last
and
his
first
year
at
leiden
perhaps
it
tickles
my
vanity
to
know
that
he
has
been
boyish
enough
to
make
me
into
a
kind
of
hero
little
though
i
deserve
it
and
whenever
i
have
been
able
to
do
him
a
good
turn
i
have
done
it
but
suddenly
i
found
myself
thinking
him
a
young
brute
and
feeling
that
he
deserved
kicking
i
suppose
miss
van
buren
has
paid
enough
attention
to
your
high
mightiness
said
i
she
has
put
herself
out
much
said
he
but
it
is
that
i
care
about
it
her
attitude
toward
you
of
course
you
could
help
hearing
what
she
said
yesterday
at
the
prinzenhof
about
the
portrait
of
william
the
silent
because
i
asked
her
afterwards
if
she
did
think
it
looked
like
you
she
said
not
a
bit
anyhow
she
had
only
been
joking
and
it
was
an
ugly
portrait
then
this
morning
at
breakfast
when
i
heard
what
happened
on
the
beach
i
told
her
that
perhaps
she
would
have
the
chance
this
afternoon
to
thank
you
instead
of
being
pleased
she
answered
that
she
thanked
you
enough
already
that
you
had
run
no
risk
as
what
you
did
was
nothing
much
after
all
and
she
hoped
i
would
bring
you
i
tell
you
brederode
i
could
have
boxed
her
ears
i
must
confess
that
mine
tingled
and
for
a
moment
i
felt
hurt
and
angry
with
the
girl
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
then
i
laughed
served
you
right
for
forcing
me
upon
her
said
i
well
it
evident
she
taken
a
dislike
to
me
it
must
be
my
business
to
change
that
for
i
have
exactly
the
opposite
feelings
toward
her
some
day
i
shall
her
like
me
i
wonder
you
can
think
it
worth
while
to
trouble
your
head
over
my
cousin
after
what
i
felt
it
right
to
tell
you
said
robert
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
otherwise
you
would
have
considered
it
strange
i
did
ask
you
to
our
box
as
i
should
have
been
proud
to
do
but
i
was
angry
for
your
sake
and
said
i
would
bring
you
near
her
now
as
things
are
i
do
see
how
you
can
meet
my
cousin
the
van
buren
blood
is
at
its
worst
in
her
and
it
has
made
her
obstinate
as
a
pig
heavens
what
a
simile
said
i
yet
i
could
help
laughing
i
too
am
obstinate
as
a
pig
and
being
proud
of
my
dutch
blood
i
like
her
the
better
for
hers
all
the
more
because
it
obstinate
blood
and
it
would
be
true
dutch
if
it
were
not
i
tell
you
robert
i
going
to
know
your
cousin
not
through
you
i
do
want
that
now
but
in
some
other
way
which
will
arrange
itself
sooner
or
later
probably
sooner
i
do
see
how
robert
repeated
i
was
in
hopes
that
she
and
miss
rivers
her
stepsister
could
have
been
persuaded
by
my
mother
to
pay
us
a
long
visit
and
give
up
an
objectionable
plan
they
have
but
cousin
helen
nell
as
miss
rivers
calls
her
has
been
even
with
my
mother
i
am
sure
it
is
not
miss
rivers
fault
she
is
not
that
kind
of
girl
do
you
mind
telling
me
the
objectionable
plan
i
asked
i
shall
be
glad
to
tell
said
he
and
see
if
you
do
agree
with
me
that
it
is
monstrous
though
strange
to
say
now
mother
has
talked
with
the
girls
does
not
seem
to
think
it
as
bad
as
she
was
inclined
to
at
first
she
tells
me
that
they
are
determined
to
persist
and
she
thinks
they
will
come
to
no
harm
my
cousin
has
been
left
a
by
a
friend
will
you
must
have
seen
it
captain
noble
which
used
to
lie
near
the
rowing
club
she
and
miss
rivers
have
come
to
take
a
trip
through
the
waterways
of
holland
though
my
mother
has
learned
that
their
financial
circumstances
hardly
warrant
such
an
undertaking
plucky
girls
was
my
comment
ah
but
you
do
know
all
a
young
man
is
going
with
them
a
strange
american
young
man
whom
they
never
saw
till
yesterday
by
jove
in
what
capacity
as
chauffeur
not
at
all
as
a
sort
of
paying
guest
so
far
as
i
can
understand
the
arrangement
it
sounds
rather
an
odd
one
i
should
say
so
but
i
must
make
you
think
it
worse
than
it
is
there
was
a
misunderstanding
about
the
boat
the
american
thought
hired
it
from
the
caretaker
and
they
were
sorry
for
his
disappointment
he
has
an
aunt
a
scotswoman
of
title
who
is
to
be
of
the
party
that
makes
all
the
difference
does
it
not
the
title
but
the
aunt
it
makes
a
difference
certainly
but
the
man
may
be
an
adventurer
he
an
artist
it
appears
named
starr
what
the
starr
whose
salon
picture
made
so
much
talk
in
paris
this
spring
yes
but
being
a
good
artist
does
constitute
him
a
good
man
he
might
make
love
to
the
girls
beast
so
he
might
aunt
or
no
aunt
she
probably
aid
and
abet
him
i
do
know
that
i
blame
you
for
objecting
to
such
an
adventure
for
your
cousin
oh
it
is
so
much
for
her
that
is
except
on
principle
but
done
all
i
can
and
my
mother
has
done
all
she
can
so
you
can
imagine
what
my
cousin
is
like
to
resist
us
both
my
mother
tells
me
she
could
do
with
her
and
the
girls
are
leaving
us
they
go
back
to
rotterdam
where
they
expect
to
find
aunt
and
they
hope
a
skipper
for
the
cousin
helen
asked
if
i
could
recommend
a
suitable
man
but
even
if
i
knew
one
i
should
not
make
it
easier
for
her
to
flout
the
wishes
of
the
family
naturally
not
said
i
with
the
sort
of
for
robert
which
makes
one
wondrous
kind
and
i
was
sure
that
if
i
were
miss
van
buren
cousin
and
had
set
myself
against
her
doing
a
certain
thing
she
would
not
have
done
it
however
they
are
returning
to
rotterdam
early
in
the
morning
and
that
being
the
case
as
i
was
saying
i
do
see
how
it
will
be
possible
for
you
to
meet
my
cousin
i
bet
that
i
will
meet
her
and
be
properly
introduced
too
before
either
of
us
is
a
week
older
said
i
and
then
was
sorry
i
had
clothed
my
resolve
in
such
crude
words
but
it
was
too
late
to
explain
or
apologize
for
at
that
instant
two
or
three
men
came
up
the
thought
of
what
i
had
blurted
out
lay
heavy
on
my
mind
afterwards
and
if
it
had
not
seemed
a
and
even
thing
to
do
i
would
have
sent
a
line
to
robert
asking
him
to
erase
that
clumsy
and
impertinent
boast
from
his
memory
if
he
is
stupid
enough
or
awkward
enough
to
repeat
anything
of
our
conversation
and
give
miss
van
buren
the
impression
that
i
tried
to
make
a
wager
concerning
her
it
will
be
all
up
with
me
i
know
as
it
is
i
can
only
hope
that
my
words
will
go
out
at
one
ear
as
fast
as
they
went
in
at
the
other
next
morning
i
had
made
no
definite
plan
of
action
but
thought
that
as
miss
van
buren
was
going
to
rotterdam
it
could
do
no
harm
for
me
to
go
to
rotterdam
too
and
see
what
would
happen
next
things
of
some
sort
were
bound
to
happen
and
one
way
or
other
my
chance
might
come
before
she
started
on
her
journey
my
mother
is
at
château
liliendaal
the
place
where
she
likes
best
to
spend
july
and
august
when
we
do
run
over
to
england
but
she
expect
me
to
join
her
for
some
days
and
meanwhile
i
was
free
to
do
as
i
chose
i
was
in
hopes
that
i
might
see
miss
van
buren
in
the
train
if
i
took
the
most
popular
one
in
the
morning
but
she
and
her
stepsister
were
not
on
board
so
i
fancied
robert
must
be
driving
them
back
in
the
borrowed
car
despite
his
objections
to
their
proceedings
i
went
straight
to
the
rowing
club
where
i
have
several
friends
and
as
i
knew
from
robert
that
the
was
i
easily
found
out
where
she
was
lying
the
next
thing
was
to
go
and
have
a
look
at
her
to
see
if
preparations
were
being
made
for
an
immediate
start
i
had
forgotten
what
she
was
like
but
i
found
her
a
handsome
little
craft
with
two
cabins
and
to
accommodate
four
or
five
passengers
also
i
learned
from
a
man
employed
on
the
quay
close
by
that
the
motor
was
an
american
one
of
thirty
he
told
me
as
well
by
way
of
gossip
that
a
rakish
barge
moored
with
her
pert
brass
nose
almost
on
lorelei
stern
had
been
hired
and
would
be
towed
by
the
owners
of
the
i
did
know
what
to
make
of
this
bit
of
information
as
robert
had
not
mentioned
a
barge
but
the
skylight
meant
a
studio
so
i
saw
the
man
starr
hand
in
the
arrangement
and
began
to
hate
the
fellow
by
the
time
i
had
loitered
in
the
neighborhood
for
half
an
hour
or
more
it
was
noon
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
go
and
lunch
at
miss
van
buren
hotel
but
this
would
look
like
dogging
the
girl
footsteps
and
eventually
i
decided
upon
a
more
subtle
means
of
gaining
my
end
nevertheless
i
strolled
past
the
house
but
seeing
nobody
worth
seeing
i
reluctantly
turned
my
steps
farther
on
to
a
garden
restaurant
a
place
with
tables
under
chestnuts
and
beeches
or
in
shady
arbors
for
parties
of
two
or
four
it
was
early
still
but
the
restaurant
is
popular
and
all
the
small
tables
under
the
trees
were
appropriated
fortunately
several
arbors
were
empty
although
one
or
two
were
engaged
and
i
walked
into
the
first
i
came
to
for
a
few
moments
i
was
kept
waiting
then
a
fluent
waiter
appeared
to
recommend
the
most
desirable
dishes
of
the
day
his
eloquence
was
in
full
tide
when
a
man
paused
before
the
entrance
of
my
arbor
hesitated
and
went
on
to
the
next
that
is
engaged
sir
called
out
the
waiter
i
do
understand
dutch
answered
the
in
can
you
speak
french
the
waiter
could
and
did
the
man
a
fellow
with
singularly
brilliant
black
eyes
and
a
fetching
smile
explained
that
it
was
he
who
had
engaged
the
arbor
that
he
was
expecting
a
lady
and
would
not
order
luncheon
until
she
joined
him
he
sat
down
with
his
gray
flannel
back
to
me
but
i
could
see
him
through
the
screen
of
leaves
and
lattice
and
it
was
clear
that
he
was
nervous
he
kept
jumping
up
going
to
the
doorway
staring
out
and
returning
to
throw
himself
on
the
hard
green
bench
with
an
impatient
sigh
evidently
she
was
late
an
omelet
arrived
for
me
and
still
my
neighbor
was
alone
but
i
had
scarcely
taken
up
my
fork
when
a
light
tripping
step
sounded
crisply
on
the
crushed
of
the
path
outside
a
shadow
darkened
the
doorway
and
for
an
instant
a
of
a
woman
in
a
neat
but
dress
hung
on
my
threshold
rather
like
a
trim
gray
sparrow
she
was
expecting
a
crumb
then
changing
her
mind
and
hopping
further
on
to
find
it
but
the
change
of
mind
came
only
with
the
springing
up
of
the
young
man
in
the
adjoining
arbor
is
that
you
he
inquired
in
an
anxious
voice
speaking
the
name
with
marked
emphasis
oh
chirped
the
gray
sparrow
flitting
to
the
next
doorway
i
must
have
counted
wrong
i
saw
a
young
man
alone
and
then
you
are
my
nephew
she
also
threw
stress
upon
the
name
and
the
relationship
and
though
i
knew
nothing
of
the
face
that
lurked
behind
a
tissue
veil
i
became
aware
that
the
lady
was
an
american
funny
thing
i
said
to
myself
they
do
seem
to
have
met
before
she
must
be
a
aunt
my
neighbor
would
have
ushered
his
relative
into
the
arbor
but
she
lingered
outside
come
tibe
she
cried
with
a
shrill
change
of
tone
here
tibe
tibe
tibe
there
was
a
sudden
stir
in
the
garden
a
pulling
of
chairs
closer
to
small
tables
a
jumping
about
of
waiters
a
few
stifled
shrieks
in
feminine
voices
and
a
powerful
bulldog
with
a
peculiarly
concentrated
and
earnest
expression
on
his
countenance
bounded
through
the
crowd
toward
his
mistress
with
a
fine
disregard
of
obstacles
evidently
if
there
was
any
dodging
to
be
done
he
had
been
brought
up
to
expect
others
to
do
it
and
i
thought
the
chances
were
that
he
would
seldom
be
disappointed
illustration
was
a
sudden
stir
in
the
good
heavens
exclaimed
nephew
ronald
as
the
monster
cannoned
against
him
you
did
mention
this
no
i
knew
you
were
sure
to
love
him
i
would
have
anything
to
do
with
a
creature
who
did
is
he
exquisite
he
a
dream
said
the
young
man
but
he
did
not
specify
what
kind
of
dream
where
i
go
there
tibe
goes
also
went
on
the
lady
his
name
is
tiberius
but
it
rather
long
to
say
when
he
doing
something
that
you
want
him
to
stop
he
lunch
with
us
like
a
perfect
gentleman
oh
he
is
more
than
dog
tibe
come
away
from
that
door
the
flower
had
paused
to
see
whether
he
approved
of
my
lunch
and
from
the
way
he
turned
back
a
protruding
black
drapery
of
underlip
from
a
pair
of
upstanding
ivory
tusks
i
judged
that
neither
it
nor
i
found
favor
in
his
eyes
perhaps
he
resented
laughter
in
mine
yet
there
was
something
after
all
in
the
flower
simile
if
not
precisely
what
the
blossom
adoring
mistress
meant
tibe
face
distinctly
resembled
a
pansy
but
an
appalling
pansy
the
sort
of
pansy
you
would
not
like
to
meet
in
the
dark
whatever
may
have
been
his
opinion
of
me
he
had
to
be
dragged
by
the
collar
from
my
door
and
later
i
caught
the
glitter
of
his
gaze
through
the
lattice
aunt
fay
slipped
in
between
bench
and
table
sitting
down
opposite
to
me
and
when
the
nephew
took
his
old
place
i
had
glimpses
of
her
over
his
shoulder
she
was
unfastening
her
veil
now
it
had
fallen
alas
for
any
hopes
which
the
trim
youthful
figure
might
have
raised
her
thick
gray
hair
was
plastered
down
over
temples
cheeks
and
ears
and
a
pair
of
uncommonly
large
blue
spectacles
left
her
eyes
to
the
imagination
i
began
to
be
afraid
there
might
have
been
some
mistake
in
the
telegram
i
sent
after
i
got
your
letter
saying
i
must
come
to
your
address
began
nephew
ronald
hastily
after
a
moment
of
silence
that
followed
the
dropping
of
the
veil
what
i
said
was
oord
third
arbor
on
the
left
as
you
come
in
by
main
entrance
lunch
quarter
past
twelve
any
cabman
will
know
the
place
was
the
message
all
right
yes
replied
aunt
fay
but
i
suffer
a
little
with
my
eyes
that
why
i
stopped
when
i
came
to
the
next
arbor
i
late
because
darling
tibe
ran
away
just
as
i
was
hailing
a
cab
so
i
had
to
let
that
one
go
and
rescue
him
from
the
crowd
wherever
he
goes
he
has
a
throng
round
him
people
admire
him
so
much
down
my
angel
you
must
put
your
feet
on
strange
gentlemen
tables
when
you
invited
to
lunch
he
hungry
poor
lamb
i
hope
you
are
also
said
nephew
politely
but
his
voice
was
heavy
i
wondered
if
he
were
disappointed
in
aunt
or
if
it
was
only
that
the
pansy
had
got
on
his
nerves
here
my
waiter
we
have
something
to
eat
and
talk
things
over
as
we
lunch
there
a
tremendous
for
a
meal
thoroughly
dutch
no
other
people
could
get
through
it
and
live
probably
you
would
prefer
let
me
see

funnily
arranged
is
it
but
tibe
and
i
have
been
living
in
furnished
lodgings
and
we
er
have
eaten
rather
irregularly
i
dare
say
between
us
we
might
manage
the
lunch
as
it
is
nephew
ronald
ordered
it
and
another
silence
fell
i
think
that
he
drummed
on
the
table
we
might
as
well
get
to
business
suggested
the
lady
does
the
aunt
engagement
begin
immediately
i
er
there
one
difficulty
faltered
the
young
man
unfortunately
i
injudiciously
let
drop
that
my
aunt
was
a
woman
really
you
might
better
have
waited
till
you
made
her
acquaintance
you
ca
pick
and
choose
in
a
hurry
when
you
must
have
a
aunt
my
dear
sir
myself
i
small
women
they
are
more
feminine
please
do
be
angry
you
see
it
was
like
this
i
said
that
when
i
still
hoped
to
have
a
real
aunt
on
hand
for
my
purpose
that
was
the
way
the
scrape
began
i
inadvertently
let
out
her
name
and
a
lot
of
things
to
the
young
ladies
i
to
chaperon
yes
to
the
young
ladies
if
they
remember
the
description
you
can
say
you
referred
to
your
aunt
character
when
you
remarked
that
she
was
a
fine
woman
i
suppose
so
still
doubtfully
but
then
there
another
trouble
you
know
i
advertised
in
nieus
van
den
for
a
aunt
i
moved
suddenly
for
a
queer
thought
jumped
into
my
head
the
blue
spectacles
were
focused
on
me
and
there
was
a
low
murmur
to
which
the
man
responded
in
his
usual
tone
no
danger
i
heard
him
talking
to
the
waiter
now
perhaps
i
should
have
called
through
the
lattice
and
the
leaves
combination
of
dutch
and
english
half
and
half
as
much
at
home
in
one
language
as
the
other
but
for
several
reasons
i
was
silent
one
was
that
it
was
easier
to
be
silent
than
to
make
a
fuss
another
was
that
if
the
suspicion
which
had
just
sprung
into
my
head
had
any
foundation
it
was
mine
or
any
man
duty
to
know
the
truth
and
act
upon
it
so
i
sat
still
and
went
on
with
my
luncheon
as
my
next
door
neighbors
went
on
with
theirs
and
no
one
remembered
my
existence
except
tibe
i
no
moral
objection
to
being
a
scotch
aunt
said
the
obliging
lady
it
your
accent
not
your
morals
that
sticks
in
my
throat
the
latter
i
trust
were
sufficiently
vouched
for
in
the
letter
from
our
american
consul
here
you
can
call
on
him
if
you
choose
few
aunts
obtained
by
advertisement
would
have
what
i
have
to
recommend
me
as
for
a
scotch
accent
i
bought
burns
and
a
crockett
in
tauchnitz
and
by
i
engage
that
no
one
unless
a
scotsman
would
know
me
from
a
scotswoman
hoot
awa
mon
come
ben
but
er
my
aunt
rather
by
way
of
being
a
swell
she
would
be
found
dead
saying
awa
ben
there
just
a
little
indescribable
then
i
will
have
just
a
little
indescribable
and
you
can
buy
me
a
tartan
blouse
and
a
tam
i
afraid
a
tam
would
would
quite
suit
your
style
or
or
that
of
any
aunt
and
a
aunt
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
situation
i
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
i
am
not
a
aunt
there
was
a
rustling
in
the
arbor
come
tibe
the
lady
added
in
a
firm
voice
you
and
i
will
go
away
and
leave
this
gentlemen
to
select
from
all
the
other
charming
and
eligible
aunts
who
have
no
doubt
answered
his
quite
conventional
and
advertisement
for
heaven
sake
do
go
cried
the
man
springing
to
his
feet
there
your
dog
got
the
duck
but
it
does
matter
nobody
else
worth
speaking
of
nobody
in
any
way
possible
has
answered
my
advertisement
i
ca
lose
you
but
you
see
i
somehow
fancied
from
your
letter
that
you
were
large
and
imposing
just
what
i
wanted
and
you
said
you
lately
been
in
scotland
the
accent
was
one
of
the
few
things
i
did
wish
to
bring
away
with
me
sniffed
the
lady
under
the
table
tibe
we
not
going
after
all
for
the
moment
and
as
you
the
duck
you
may
as
well
eat
it
good
dog
groaned
the
stricken
young
man
if
he
had
not
to
the
best
of
my
belief
been
engaged
in
concocting
a
treacherous
plot
against
one
whom
i
intended
to
protect
i
could
have
pitied
him
both
sat
down
again
there
was
a
pause
while
plates
were
changed
and
then
the
female
plotter
took
up
the
running
i
may
be
conceited
said
she
but
my
opinion
is
that
you
very
lucky
to
get
me
i
may
not
be
scotch
and
i
may
not
be
a
but
i
am
a
lady
oh
of
course
what
were
the
others
like
who
answered
your
advertisement
all
dutch
and
spoke
broken
english
except
one
who
was
german
she
wore
a
reform
dress
hunched
up
behind
with
unspeakable
elastic
things
you
make
allowances
if
you
knew
what
i
gone
through
since
the
day
before
yesterday
when
i
found
after
telegraphing
a
frantic
appeal
to
my
aunt
in
scotland
that
she
left
home
and
they
could
give
me
no
address
i
had
an
awful
time
my
nerves
are
shattered
then
you
better
secure
peace
by
securing
me
an
aunt
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush
a
good
aunt
needs
no
bush
i
mean
oh
i
do
know
what
i
mean
but
of
course
i
ask
nothing
better
than
to
secure
you
no
you
mean
you
think
you
nothing
better
ha
ha
i
agree
with
you
but
tibe
and
i
did
come
here
to
be
played
with
giving
us
a
very
good
lunch
but
i
have
his
future
and
mine
to
think
of
i
admit
i
in
want
of
an
engagement
as
a
traveling
companion
to
ladies
in
holland
but
you
are
the
only
person
to
whom
it
occurs
to
put
ads
in
dutch
papers
if
you
searched
the
columns
of
nieus
van
den
you
might
have
seen
mine
i
have
not
been
without
answers
and
i
do
know
that
i
should
care
to
be
an
aunt
anyway
it
makes
one
seem
so
what
i
came
to
say
was
that
unless
you
can
offer
me
an
immediate
engagement
oh
i
can
and
do
i
beg
of
you
to
be
my
aunt
from
this
moment
tibe
to
travel
with
me
and
have
every
comfort
yes
yes
and
luxury
a
pint
of
warm
milk
every
morning
half
a
pound
of
best
beef
or
chicken
with
vegetables
at
noon
two
eggs
at
certainly
he
has
but
to
choose
he
seems
to
know
his
own
mind
pretty
well
i
do
think
it
a
subject
for
joking
that
duck
was
close
to
the
edge
of
the
table
we
better
talk
your
letter
said
a
hundred
gulden
a
week
to
a
suitable
aunt
and
a
two
months
engagement
certain
well
it
not
enough
i
should
want
at
least
three
hundred
dollars
extra
down
in
advance
i
ca
do
it
in
gulden
in
my
head
for
sake
for
my
sake
do
you
see
to
do
you
credit
as
a
relative
i
must
have
things
nice
things
plenty
of
nice
things
tartan
blouses
and
if
not
tams
cairngorms
yes
a
cairngorm
brooch
would
be
realistic
i
saw
a
beauty
yesterday
only
two
hundred
gulden
no
aunt
of
yours
can
go
for
a
trip
on
the
waterways
of
holland
unless
she
well
fitted
out
i
been
admiring
the
dress
you
are
wearing
it
wonderfully
trim
thanks
but
it
happens
to
be
about
a
hundred
years
old
and
is
the
only
one
i
have
left
as
for
my
hat
and
boots
but
tibe
and
i
have
suffered
some
undeserved
vicissitudes
of
late
i
sorry
to
hear
that
of
course
you
must
have
three
hundred
dollars
to
begin
with
by
the
way
am
i
or
miss
you
must
know
best
as
to
i
mean
me
in
the
part
of
your
aunt
oh
you
neither
miss
nor
i
mean
you
married
but
you
have
a
title
that
will
come
more
expensive
a
person
of
title
should
have
a
diamond
guard
for
her
you
that
do
you
now
you
speak
of
it
i
do
would
you
like
her
to
wear
a
cap
for
indoors
sounds
as
if
she
were
a
parlormaid
not
at
all
i
sure
a
proper
scotch
aunt
would
wear
a
cap
mine
a
proper
scotch
aunt
and
she
does
she
about
forty
but
she
looks
nobody
would
believe
she
was
anybody
aunt
but
you
want
everybody
to
believe
i
yours
oh
have
a
cap
by
all
means
it
should
be
real
lace
buy
it
and
another
to
change
with
buy
that
too
get
a
dozen
if
you
like
thanks
i
will
i
believe
you
just
said
the
engagement
dates
from
rather
i
was
going
to
tell
you
i
must
have
an
aunt
by
this
evening
she
arrives
from
scotland
you
know
with
her
dog
easy
i
hope
the
girls
like
dogs
they
do
if
they
nice
girls
they
enchanting
girls
one
english
one
american
i
adore
both
that
why
i
a
desperate
man
where
an
aunt
concerned
to
produce
an
aunt
is
my
one
hope
of
enjoying
their
society
on
the
trip
i
wrote
you
about
i
would
do
this
thing
if
i
were
desperate
and
even
desperate
as
i
am
i
would
do
it
if
i
could
have
got
an
kind
of
aunt
an
aunt
that
that
that
an
unimpeachable
american
consul
could
vouch
for
i
assure
you
nephew
you
ought
to
think
of
a
woman
like
me
as
of
of
a
ram
caught
in
the
bushes
i
willing
to
think
of
you
in
that
way
if
it
not
offensive
the
consul
did
go
into
particulars
that
was
unnecessary
perhaps
everything
settled
then
i
count
you
out
five
hundred
dollars
in
gulden
buy
what
you
choose
so
long
as
it
meet
your
train
at
we
say
seven
the
beurs
station
i
understand
i
be
there
with
tibe
and
our
luggage
but
you
told
me
your
name
yet
i
my
letter
to
you
mary
milton
cautiously
ronald
starr
is
your
nephew
name
lady
macnairne
is
my
aunt
i
came
very
near
choking
myself
with
a
long
before
this
i
been
sure
of
his
name
but
i
had
expected
to
hear
lady
macnairne
forty
and
looks
yes
that
was
a
fair
description
of
lady
macnairne
as
far
as
it
went
but
much
more
might
be
said
by
her
admirers
of
whom
i
openly
declared
myself
one
before
a
audience
at
a
country
house
in
scotland
not
quite
a
year
ago
it
was
merely
a
little
flirtation
to
pass
the
time
on
both
our
parts
a
woman
of
forty
who
is
a
beauty
and
a
flirt
has
no
time
to
waste
and
lady
macnairne
is
not
wasteful
she
was
the
handsomest
woman
at
kinloch
towers
my
cousin
dave
norman
place
and
a
dutchman
was
a
novelty
to
her
so
we
amused
ourselves
for
ten
days
and
i
should
have
kept
the
pleasantest
memory
of
the
episode
if
sir
alec
had
not
taken
it
into
his
head
to
be
jealous
poor
fleda
macnairne
was
whisked
away
before
the
of
the
and
that
is
the
last
i
have
seen
of
her
but
not
the
last
i
heard
once
in
a
while
i
get
a
letter
amusing
erratic
like
herself
and
in
such
communications
she
does
scruple
to
chronicle
other
flirtations
which
have
followed
hard
on
mine
only
a
short
time
before
the
making
of
this
plot
in
a
rotterdam
garden
a
letter
from
her
gave
startling
news
consequently
i
am
now
in
possession
of
knowledge
apparently
denied
to
the
nephew
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
pair
in
the
next
arbor
separated
the
woman
departing
to
purchase
the
fittings
of
aunthood
the
man
remaining
to
pay
the
bill
but
before
he
had
time
to
beckon
the
waiter
i
got
up
and
walked
into
his
lair
starr
i
said
i
going
to
stop
your
game
the
devil
you
are
and
who
are
you
answered
he
first
staring
then
flushing
my
name
rudolph
brederode
said
i
you
a
d
d
eavesdropper
said
he
you
are
the
same
kind
of
a
fool
for
thinking
because
your
neighbor
spoke
dutch
he
could
know
english
i
sat
still
and
let
you
go
on
because
i
do
mean
to
allow
any
of
the
persons
concerned
to
be
imposed
upon
by
you
he
glared
at
me
across
the
table
as
if
he
could
have
killed
me
and
i
glared
back
at
him
yet
all
the
while
i
was
conscious
of
a
sneaking
kindness
for
the
fellow
he
looked
so
stricken
rather
like
an
endearing
scamp
of
an
eton
boy
who
has
got
into
a
horrid
scrape
and
is
being
hauled
over
the
coals
by
the
head
what
business
is
it
of
yours
he
wanted
to
know
lady
macnairne
a
friend
of
mine
indeed
but
what
of
that
she
my
aunt
and
robert
van
buren
is
another
friend
an
intimate
one
he
has
told
me
about
his
cousin
he
does
approve
of
the
tour
as
it
is
when
he
hears
from
me
oh
hang
it
all
why
do
you
want
to
be
such
a
spoilsport
demanded
the
poor
wretch
in
torture
did
never
fall
in
love
with
a
girl
and
feel
you
do
anything
to
get
her
this
sudden
change
this
throwing
himself
upon
my
mercy
took
me
somewhat
aback
in
threatening
to
tear
the
mote
from
his
eye
what
about
a
certain
obstruction
in
mine
he
was
quick
to
see
his
advantage
and
follow
it
up
you
say
you
heard
everything
then
you
must
see
why
i
thought
of
this
plan
i
hoped
at
first
aunt
fleda
might
be
prevailed
on
to
come
when
i
lost
that
hope
i
just
could
give
up
the
trip
i
had
to
get
an
aunt
to
chaperon
those
blessed
girls
or
it
was
to
them
for
me
what
harm
am
i
doing
the
woman
respectable
the
consul
has
written
me
a
letter
about
her
if
you
know
aunt
fay
that
my
name
for
her
you
know
she
would
call
this
the
best
kind
of
a
lark
i
confess
to
her
some
day
i
have
my
head
cut
off
sooner
than
injure
miss
rivers
or
miss
van
buren
afterwards
when
we
got
to
be
great
friends
they
shall
hear
the
whole
story
i
promise
but
of
course
you
can
ruin
me
if
you
tell
them
or
let
your
friend
tell
them
at
this
stage
you
think
fair
to
take
advantage
of
what
you
overheard
by
accident
and
spoil
the
chance
of
my
life
oh
now
what
can
i
do
to
make
you
keep
still
well
i
was
all
i
could
answer
and
a
good
deal
to
my
own
surprise
i
heard
myself
suddenly
burst
into
sardonic
laughter
then
he
laughed
too
and
we
roared
together
if
any
one
noticed
us
they
must
have
thought
us
friends
of
a
lifetime
yet
five
minutes
ago
we
had
been
like
dogs
ready
to
fly
at
each
other
throats
and
there
was
no
earthly
reason
why
we
should
not
be
of
the
same
mind
still
you
going
to
let
me
alone
are
you
he
continued
to
plead
when
he
was
calmer
you
are
going
to
do
unto
me
as
you
be
done
by
and
give
my
true
love
a
chance
to
run
smooth
if
you
refuse
i
could
wish
that
fearful
flower
back
that
i
might
set
him
at
you
my
lips
twitched
i
not
sure
said
i
whether
you
ought
to
be
in
a
gaol
or
in
the
i
ought
to
be
on
a
tour
with
the
two
most
charming
girls
in
the
world
and
if
i
not
to
be
there
i
might
as
well
be
in
my
grave
do
ask
people
about
me
ask
my
aunt
i
not
a
villain
i
one
of
the
nicest
fellows
you
ever
met
and
i
no
bad
intentions
i
got
too
much
money
to
be
an
adventurer
why
look
here
i
supposed
to
be
quite
a
good
match
either
of
the
girls
can
have
me
and
my
millions
both
are
at
the
feet
of
either
at
present
i
no
choice
do
drive
me
to
drink
i
should
hate
to
die
of
schnapps
and
there
nothing
else
liquid
i
could
well
die
of
in
holland
as
he
talked
i
had
been
thinking
hard
and
fast
i
should
have
to
spare
him
i
saw
that
but
i
saw
something
else
too
i
keep
your
ridiculous
secret
starr
on
one
condition
i
said
you
only
to
name
it
invite
me
to
go
with
you
on
the
trip
my
fellow
for
heaven
sake
do
ask
me
the
one
thing
i
do
it
cruelty
to
animals
it
is
trip
i
a
guest
perhaps
you
do
understand
yes
i
do
van
buren
told
me
he
mentioned
that
you
had
been
able
to
get
a
skipper
to
take
the
through
the
canals
that
true
but
we
sha
be
delayed
we
have
our
choice
between
two
chaps
with
fair
references
not
ideal
men
perhaps
but
you
do
need
an
admiral
to
get
you
through
a
each
canal
is
different
from
every
other
you
must
have
a
man
who
knows
every
inch
of
the
way
whatever
route
you
choose
or
you
get
into
serious
trouble
now
as
you
been
praising
yourself
i
follow
your
example
you
could
find
a
skipper
who
knows
more
about
and
dutch
waterways
than
i
do
and
i
volunteer
for
the
job
i
go
if
you
go
there
the
offer
are
you
serious
all
his
nonsense
was
suddenly
forgotten
absolutely
why
do
you
want
to
go
you
must
have
a
reason
i
have
it
much
the
same
as
yours
i
blowed
then
you
met
them
i
seen
them
apparently
that
about
all
you
done
you
mean
if
i
wo
get
you
on
board
as
skipper
you
give
me
away
i
was
silent
i
did
not
now
mean
anything
of
the
kind
for
it
would
be
impossible
to
betray
the
engaging
wretch
but
i
was
willing
that
he
should
think
my
silence
gave
consent
they
would
know
you
were
a
common
hired
skipper
how
could
i
explain
you
why
say
you
a
dutch
friend
who
has
offered
to
go
as
you
ca
find
any
one
else
who
competent
for
the
job
you
better
not
mention
your
friend
name
at
first
if
you
can
avoid
it
as
the
ladies
have
been
anxious
about
the
skipper
and
asked
van
buren
to
get
one
they
probably
be
thankful
it
all
right
and
only
too
glad
to
accept
a
friend
of
yours
in
the
place
poor
deceived
angels
what
to
prevent
your
snatching
one
of
them
from
under
my
very
nose
you
must
run
the
risk
of
that
besides
you
need
worry
about
it
till
you
make
up
your
mind
which
angel
you
want
i
should
naturally
want
whichever
one
you
did
we
are
made
like
that
if
you
do
agree
and
they
go
without
you
you
ca
get
either
that
true
most
disagreeable
things
are
and
there
just
a
chance
if
you
get
dangerous
that
tibe
might
polish
you
off
i
saw
the
way
he
looked
at
you
well
needs
must
when
somebody
drives
it
a
bargain
then
i
tell
the
girls
what
a
kind
generous
dutch
friend
i
have
we
be
villains
together
ix
we
settled
that
starr
should
see
miss
van
buren
and
miss
rivers
and
tell
them
that
skipper
chauffeur
and
chaperon
all
being
provided
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
tour
beginning
having
done
this
without
bringing
in
his
obliging
friend
name
he
was
to
meet
me
at
the
rowing
club
at
three
with
a
detailed
report
of
all
that
had
happened
up
to
date
never
was
time
slower
in
passing
each
minute
seemed
as
long
as
the
dying
speech
of
a
tragedian
who
fancies
himself
in
a
death
scene
i
wanted
to
use
some
of
these
minutes
in
writing
to
robert
but
it
would
be
premature
to
tell
him
that
i
was
going
to
look
after
his
cousin
and
her
sister
on
the
trip
as
the
ladies
might
abandon
it
rather
than
put
up
with
my
society
when
ten
minutes
past
three
came
and
no
starr
i
was
certain
that
they
would
not
have
me
i
could
hardly
have
been
gloomier
if
i
been
waiting
for
a
surgical
operation
but
another
five
minutes
brought
my
confederate
and
the
first
sight
of
his
face
sent
my
spirits
up
with
a
bound
it
all
right
he
said
they
come
back
from
scheveningen
i
saw
them
at
their
hotel
and
they
more
beautiful
than
ever
they
were
prostrate
with
grief
at
hearing
i
had
been
able
to
get
hold
of
a
skipper
consequently
they
were
too
excited
to
ask
your
name
when
i
gave
them
the
cheering
news
that
a
dutch
friend
had
come
to
the
rescue
they
simply
swallowed
you
whole
and
clamored
for
the
next
course
so
i
added
the
er
glad
tidings
of
my
aunt
arrival
this
evening
and
poured
the
last
drop
of
joy
in
their
cup
by
saying
we
could
start
they
going
to
bring
most
of
their
things
on
board
after
tea
this
afternoon
about
five
oh
by
the
way
just
as
i
was
leaving
miss
van
buren
did
call
after
me
your
friend
nice
i
laughed
what
did
you
answer
i
thought
one
more
fib
among
so
many
could
matter
so
i
said
you
were
heaven
forgive
me
are
you
really
dutch
or
is
that
another
figure
of
speech
i
always
think
and
speak
of
myself
as
wholly
dutch
i
replied
but
my
mother
is
english
i
must
telegraph
her
and
i
must
write
my
man
to
bring
me
some
clothes
the
first
thing
morning
then
you
better
send
for
the
chauffeur
you
engaged
and
we
go
together
to
interview
him
on
the
boat
before
the
ladies
come
i
think
er
it
wo
be
best
for
me
to
meet
them
till
are
you
sure
your
chauffeur
a
good
man
not
at
all
said
starr
airily
i
merely
know
that
he
a
very
young
youth
who
makes
you
feel
like
a
grandfather
at
who
wriggles
and
turns
pink
if
you
speak
to
him
suddenly
and
when
he
wants
his
handkerchief
to
mop
his
perpetually
moist
forehead
pulls
yards
of
cotton
waste
out
of
his
pocket
by
mistake
i
only
his
word
for
it
which
i
could
understand
as
it
was
in
dutch
that
he
has
the
slightest
knowledge
of
any
motor
but
he
showed
me
written
references
and
seemed
so
proud
of
what
they
set
forth
i
thought
they
must
be
all
right
though
i
could
read
them
you
a
queer
fellow
i
exclaimed
well
you
see
i
an
artist
neither
motorist
nor
botorist
by
the
way
what
are
you
beyond
being
van
buren
friend
a
jack
of
several
trades
said
i
i
know
a
bit
about
horses
botors
motors
i
fancy
i
a
judge
of
dogs
i
congratulate
you
on
tibe
also
of
chauffeurs
so
come
along
and
we
put
yours
through
his
paces
it
now
appeared
that
starr
had
the
youth
on
board
so
i
sent
my
two
telegrams
and
we
started
to
walk
to
the
boat
on
the
way
starr
told
me
more
than
i
had
heard
from
robert
about
his
first
dealings
with
lorelei
and
we
discussed
details
of
the
trip
the
ladies
have
no
choice
it
appears
except
that
they
will
feel
if
allowed
to
miss
anything
as
for
starr
he
confessed
blissful
ignorance
of
holland
i
want
to
go
where
cows
wear
coats
and
women
wear
gold
helmets
and
dogs
have
revolving
kennels
he
said
and
i
want
to
paint
everything
i
see
cows
wear
coats
at
gouda
i
expect
you
read
that
in
carlyle
resartus
women
wear
gold
helmets
in
friesland
dogs
have
revolving
kennels
in
zeeland
i
told
him
and
if
you
want
to
paint
everything
you
see
we
shall
be
gone
a
long
time
all
the
better
said
starr
i
agreed
it
would
be
useful
if
could
plan
out
a
trip
he
went
on
it
would
help
to
account
for
you
you
know
and
make
you
popular
i
caught
at
this
idea
there
are
a
good
many
places
that
i
should
like
to
show
miss
van
buren
and
visit
with
her
i
should
have
preferred
her
seeing
my
country
on
our
i
said
to
myself
this
is
the
next
best
though
and
we
can
have
the
honeymoon
in
italy
but
aloud
i
remarked
that
i
would
map
out
something
and
submit
it
to
my
passengers
in
the
morning
my
mother
laughs
telling
me
that
i
must
always
go
in
for
any
new
fad
whatever
it
may
be
and
that
she
expects
some
day
to
see
several
makes
of
airship
tethered
on
the
lawn
at
liliendaal
or
tied
to
our
chimneys
at
the
hague
in
winter
there
something
in
her
jibe
perhaps
but
it
would
be
a
queer
thing
indeed
if
a
son
of
the
turn
to
botoring
provided
he
had
any
soul
for
sport
we
hollanders
made
practical
use
of
while
the
people
of
dry
lands
still
poked
ridicule
at
them
in
comic
illustrated
papers
therefore
this
will
be
by
no
means
my
first
experience
i
had
that
three
years
ago
with
a
racer
and
again
with
a
barge
which
i
fitted
up
with
a
twenty
motor
and
used
for
a
whole
summer
after
which
in
a
generous
mood
i
gave
her
as
a
to
my
chauffeur
whose
bride
greatest
ambition
was
for
since
that
time
always
meant
to
get
something
good
in
the
botoring
line
but
made
up
my
mind
what
it
ought
to
be
i
did
myself
no
more
than
justice
in
telling
starr
that
i
was
as
desirable
a
man
as
he
could
find
for
skipper
and
i
shook
hands
with
myself
for
every
hour
of
botoring
i
had
done
thanks
to
past
experience
i
can
now
do
chauffeur
work
if
necessary
as
well
as
skipper
we
found
the
very
young
youth
on
deck
industriously
polishing
and
his
complexion
bore
out
starr
description
as
i
questioned
him
about
his
former
situations
it
seems
there
was
only
one
and
with
a
small
boat
but
the
motor
was
the
same
as
this
the
arrangement
of
lorelei
deck
aft
pleases
me
particularly
for
it
might
have
been
designed
to
suit
my
purpose
that
purpose
is
to
have
as
much
of
miss
van
buren
society
as
possible
during
this
trip
consequently
i
saw
with
pleasure
that
the
passengers
in
their
must
group
round
the
skipper
at
his
wheel
as
there
is
no
other
comfortable
place
there
will
be
no
notice
up
on
board
lorelei
please
do
not
speak
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
the
more
he
is
spoken
to
by
the
right
person
the
better
he
will
like
his
job
what
i
have
to
pray
for
is
dry
weather
that
the
ladies
may
spend
their
days
on
deck
for
just
as
much
time
as
they
spend
below
i
shall
consider
that
i
am
wasting
indeed
i
regret
the
attractiveness
of
the
cabins
for
i
fear
there
may
be
a
temptation
to
dawdle
there
or
lie
among
cushions
on
the
comfortable
on
a
gray
or
chilly
day
i
hope
she
as
much
interested
in
scenery
as
she
apparently
is
in
history
i
said
to
myself
as
starr
and
i
wandered
over
the
boat
for
the
can
be
combined
with
the
business
of
lecturer
and
if
that
proves
a
bid
for
popularity
aft
of
the
cabins
is
the
and
hearing
our
voices
through
the
skylight
chauffeur
hendrik
left
the
and
came
to
stand
by
his
engine
i
immediately
determined
to
study
this
engine
thoroughly
so
that
if
hendrik
intelligence
prove
untrustworthy
in
an
emergency
mine
may
be
prepared
to
assist
it
he
soon
saw
that
it
was
useless
to
show
off
before
me
but
he
enjoyed
explaining
the
motor
in
broken
english
to
starr
the
american
artist
heard
with
a
vague
smile
the
difference
between
the
ordinary
engine
of
an
automobile
and
the
engine
of
this
marine
motor
with
its
piston
receiving
an
impulse
at
each
down
stroke
tried
to
understand
how
the
charge
of
vaporized
petrol
was
drawn
into
the
and
there
slightly
compressed
how
the
gas
afterwards
traveled
along
a
into
the
firing
chamber
at
the
upper
part
of
the
cylinder
to
be
further
compressed
by
the
of
the
piston
and
fired
by
the
sparking
plug
while
the
burnt
gases
escaped
through
a
port
uncovered
by
the
piston
in
its
downward
strokes
admission
and
exhaust
being
thus
controlled
by
the
piston
movement
alone
great
heavens
i
wronged
this
good
youth
the
patient
listener
cried
when
he
found
a
chance
to
speak
i
thought
him
all
pinkness
and
perspiration
and
purple
velvet
slippers
but
he
can
pull
information
by
the
yard
out
of
his
brain
as
he
does
cotton
waste
out
of
his
pocket
unfortunately
it
waste
too
as
far
as
i
concerned
for
i
do
know
any
more
about
this
motor
now
than
i
did
when
he
began
the
tap
of
my
intelligence
always
seems
to
be
turned
off
the
minute
anything
technical
or
mechanical
is
mentioned
some
of
those
things
he
said
sounded
more
like
the
description
of
a
lunatic
asylum
than
anything
else
and
the
only
impression
left
on
my
mind
is
one
of
dreadful
gloom
why
i
asked
because
it
seems
impossible
that
anything
which
has
to
do
so
much
at
the
same
time
as
this
engine
does
can
remember
to
do
half
of
it
it
will
certainly
fail
and
blow
up
with
those
we
love
on
board
i
never
thought
of
that
until
now
and
should
if
hendrik
had
explained
things
to
me
we
ca
blow
up
unless
the
petrol
gets
on
fire
said
i
and
as
the
tank
away
at
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
the
petrol
descends
to
the
engine
by
gravity
and
not
pressure
you
need
have
nightmare
on
that
subject
that
another
horror
i
had
realized
groaned
starr
i
took
things
for
granted
and
trusted
other
people
to
know
them
a
whole
tank
of
petrol
at
the
bow
how
much
will
there
be
in
it
enough
to
last
four
days
one
of
the
ladies
is
sure
to
set
it
on
fire
when
she
curling
her
hair
with
a
yet
we
ca
forbid
them
to
curl
their
hair
on
their
own
boat
perhaps
they
better
sleep
on
the
barge
after
all
i
meant
it
to
be
for
the
men
of
the
party
nonsense
said
i
they
reasonable
creatures
besides
miss
van
buren
hair
curls
naturally
how
can
you
know
well
i
do
and
before
my
eyes
arose
the
picture
of
a
bright
goddess
of
foam
and
spray
hum
i
begin
to
see
which
way
the
wind
blows
i
not
sure
she
the
one
i
myself
we
were
talking
about
the
motor
i
cut
in
the
water
jacketing
seems
thoroughly
carried
out
and
when
the
party
assembled
on
deck
it
will
hear
no
more
noise
than
the
buzzing
of
a
big
bee
as
the
exhaust
is
led
away
below
the
it
wo
be
bad
in
the
cabins
either
even
when
they
keep
the
sliding
door
open
for
this
screen
of
thick
will
deaden
what
sound
there
is
and
it
was
a
smart
idea
to
utilize
the
power
of
the
magneto
to
light
up
the
whole
boat
with
those
incandescent
burners
your
mechanical
information
on
top
of
hendrik
is
giving
me
a
kind
of
acute
mental
dyspepsia
sighed
starr
i
hate
people
they
so
fond
of
telling
you
things
you
do
want
to
know
still
i
realize
that
you
going
to
be
useful
in
a
way
so
i
suppose
i
must
make
the
best
of
you
and
anyhow
we
sha
see
much
of
each
other
except
at
meals
sha
we
why
are
you
going
to
spend
most
of
your
time
on
board
your
barge
steering
not
i
engaged
a
man
did
i
tell
you
a
nice
handy
man
not
too
big
for
his
boots
or
rather
his
carpet
slippers
he
cook
sweep
dust
and
make
beds
as
well
as
keep
the
barge
steady
while
i
skipper
of
nobody
wears
carpet
slippers
or
purple
velvet
ones
either
on
board
this
boat
or
her
tender
i
suppose
if
you
not
going
to
steer
you
mean
to
occupy
yourself
in
your
studio
painting
a
wise
arrangement
from
your
point
of
view
but
it
is
my
intention
i
shall
if
the
ladies
do
object
sit
mostly
on
deck
making
sketches
and
entertaining
them
as
well
as
i
know
how
though
not
with
technical
information
i
shall
be
there
to
give
them
that
if
they
want
it
said
i
you
have
to
be
at
the
bow
skippering
i
do
skipper
at
the
bow
thank
you
i
skipper
on
deck
aft
where
i
stand
at
the
wheel
and
have
full
control
of
the
engine
through
this
long
lever
that
carried
up
from
the
hang
it
i
thought
hendrik
as
chauffeur
would
have
to
be
there
and
you
keep
a
sort
of
outlook
with
a
binnacle
or
something
you
going
to
be
a
regular
albatross
to
my
ancient
mariner
you
do
forget
that
it
by
grace
of
the
albatross
that
you
a
mariner
at
all
i
shall
call
you
when
i
feel
your
weight
too
much
said
starr
and
then
we
two
villains
of
the
piece
could
not
forbear
a
grin
in
each
other
faces
i
even
found
myself
wondering
if
the
ancient
one
and
his
bird
might
not
form
for
one
another
a
kind
of
attachment
of
habit
in
the
end
it
certainly
a
queer
association
this
of
ours
but
as
the
mariner
proposed
to
do
we
began
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
we
finished
my
visit
to
the
boat
on
outwardly
friendly
terms
we
even
sat
on
deck
and
put
our
heads
together
over
my
in
which
i
jotted
down
a
plan
of
the
tour
with
lorelei
i
assured
him
we
had
but
to
choose
our
route
for
as
she
draws
only
from
three
to
three
and
a
half
feet
of
water
all
the
waterways
are
open
to
us
did
she
draw
more
she
would
be
useless
even
in
certain
rivers
in
a
dry
season
such
as
this
is
proving
and
in
many
small
canals
at
any
season
there
only
one
thing
which
may
bother
us
in
the
frisian
meers
where
we
ca
shove
with
a
quant
pole
or
if
we
venture
out
to
sea
we
have
no
means
of
propulsion
except
the
motor
and
as
we
carry
no
mast
we
can
not
set
so
much
as
a
yard
of
canvas
if
anything
should
go
wrong
with
the
motor
brilliant
lorelei
will
instantly
become
a
mere
hulk
at
the
mercy
of
wind
and
wave
however
as
starr
remarked
sagely
we
can
stop
in
port
for
wind
and
wave
and
be
very
happy
as
we
talked
down
on
a
page
of
my
went
a
roughly
sketched
map
of
holland
my
idea
being
to
begin
with
gouda
going
on
to
leiden
slipping
through
the
villages
of
south
holland
which
seem
strange
to
travelers
and
skirting
the
great
polder
that
was
once
the
famed
then
having
seen
haarlem
sitting
on
her
throne
of
flowers
to
pass
on
giving
a
few
days
to
amsterdam
and
interesting
places
in
the
neighborhood
watery
and
settlements
of
the
merchant
princes
next
in
order
the
curious
island
of
marken
and
the
artists
haunts
at
volendam
from
there
to
turn
toward
the
north
and
the
dead
cities
of
the
zuider
zee
crossing
afterwards
to
friesland
in
search
of
beauties
in
golden
helmets
and
lingering
for
a
while
among
the
frisian
meers
later
we
might
work
our
way
through
holland
most
desolate
and
savage
province
drenthe
to
the
hills
of
gelderland
my
native
country
and
finish
the
trip
with
a
grand
climax
in
zeeland
most
mysterious
and
picturesque
of
all
half
hidden
in
the
sea
i
traced
the
proposed
route
for
starr
telling
him
that
we
could
do
such
a
tour
in
five
weeks
or
eight
according
to
the
inclinations
of
the
travelers
and
the
length
of
time
they
cared
to
spend
in
each
place
as
to
that
the
ladies
must
decide
i
said
and
choose
whether
they
would
sleep
each
night
on
lorelei
or
see
more
of
dutch
life
by
going
to
hotels
but
in
any
case
i
must
plan
to
bring
the
boat
each
evening
near
enough
civilization
to
obtain
supplies
a
good
itinerary
said
the
mariner
approving
his
albatross
but
i
warn
you
i
shall
claim
half
the
credit
when
you
see
me
swaggering
and
hear
me
boasting
of
the
plans
my
friend
brederode
and
i
have
mapped
out
contradict
me
if
you
dare
i
defy
you
in
some
things
or
i
shall
burst
of
sheer
spite
and
we
can
test
it
now
if
you
like
for
here
they
come
it
was
true
they
were
in
a
cab
with
luggage
under
the
driver
feet
i
had
let
time
slip
away
forgetting
that
i
meant
to
escape
before
five
when
starr
had
told
me
they
were
due
but
i
was
determined
not
to
meet
them
now
there
was
still
time
for
miss
van
buren
to
find
some
excuse
and
wreck
the
tour
if
she
were
annoyed
by
my
obstinate
determination
to
know
her
there
will
not
be
time
unless
she
cares
to
make
a
scene
and
i
do
think
she
is
a
girl
to
make
scenes
no
i
leave
your
friends
to
you
for
the
present
said
i
we
ought
to
start
by
ten
and
i
be
on
hand
at
nine
i
know
not
whether
to
curse
or
bless
you
said
the
mariner
but
i
gave
him
no
time
to
do
either
i
was
off
and
out
of
the
way
before
i
could
be
noticed
and
recognized
by
the
occupants
of
the
cab
then
back
to
the
club
i
came
to
write
a
short
letter
to
robert
and
to
jot
down
a
few
happenings
for
my
own
benefit
later
x
it
was
nine
in
the
morning
a
morning
of
blue
and
gold
when
i
arrived
on
board
lorelei
with
a
small
box
which
my
man
brought
me
from
liliendaal
according
to
telegraphed
orders
no
one
was
there
but
the
chauffeur
though
on
board
the
barge
waterspin
the
handy
man
had
arrived
and
was
settling
into
his
new
quarters
toon
de
jongh
is
his
name
and
i
conceived
a
liking
for
his
grave
brown
face
at
sight
i
know
his
type
well
a
type
which
excels
in
deeds
not
words
and
was
bred
in
the
low
countries
by
certain
policies
of
philip
second
of
spain
he
liked
me
too
for
some
reason
or
other
i
saw
by
his
eyes
in
a
way
one
never
mistakes
but
can
never
explain
i
had
to
find
my
quarters
on
the
barge
and
going
below
on
the
first
door
i
saw
a
visiting
card
of
ronald
starr
conspicuously
pinned
with
the
one
word
alb
printed
large
upon
it
in
red
ink
chuckling
i
took
possession
of
the
cabin
hauled
my
things
out
from
my
box
and
had
got
them
mostly
packed
in
lockers
and
drawers
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
voices
on
lorelei
she
was
there
what
would
she
say
when
she
discovered
that
the
man
she
had
thanked
enough
and
did
want
to
see
again
had
foisted
himself
upon
her
party
the
evil
moment
could
be
postponed
for
long
i
might
give
them
time
to
go
below
and
add
the
contents
of
their
to
the
belongings
they
had
bestowed
in
the
cabins
yesterday
afternoon
but
that
would
take
fifteen
minutes
at
most
and
then
they
would
be
wanting
to
start
i
should
have
to
get
on
board
lorelei
be
introduced
and
face
the
music
whether
it
played
the
rogue
march
or
hail
the
conquering
hero
the
sound
of
girls
laughter
was
so
upsetting
that
i
could
decide
what
to
do
with
my
collars
and
neckties
i
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
cabin
with
my
hands
full
grumbling
aloud
what
an
ass
you
are
and
had
yet
made
up
my
mind
to
cross
over
to
lorelei
when
starr
pounded
on
the
door
thank
goodness
you
here
he
exclaimed
as
the
door
fell
back
and
revealed
me
what
has
happened
to
make
you
give
thanks
i
asked
disposing
hurriedly
of
the
neckties
any
port
in
a
storm
even
albport
and
there
a
storm
an
awful
storm
at
least
lorelei
staggering
about
as
if
she
were
over
and
if
you
do
get
us
off
at
once
every
soul
on
board
will
be
lost
or
what
worse
seasick
a
nice
beginning
for
the
trip
i
am
so
much
at
home
on
the
water
that
i
had
noticed
the
tossing
and
lolloping
of
the
barge
but
i
realized
now
what
was
the
matter
the
morning
was
fresh
with
a
gusty
wind
blowing
up
the
maas
against
the
tide
running
strongly
out
and
consequently
little
lorelei
and
sturdy
waterspin
strained
at
their
moorings
like
chained
dogs
who
spy
a
bone
just
beyond
their
reach
i
did
stop
to
answer
but
bolted
off
the
barge
and
onto
the
toon
and
hendrik
cast
off
the
moorings
the
chauffeur
flew
below
to
set
his
engine
going
i
took
the
wheel
pushed
over
the
starting
lever
the
little
propeller
began
to
turn
and
we
were
away
on
the
first
of
the
watery
miles
which
stretch
before
us
for
joy
or
sorrow
starr
had
followed
hendrik
below
and
just
as
the
motor
was
getting
well
to
work
revolving
under
my
feet
at
the
rate
of
six
hundred
revolutions
a
minute
i
heard
his
voice
shouting
hullo
hullo
catch
the
dog
you
up
there
at
the
same
instant
arose
a
babel
of
cries
oh
my
angel
do
let
him
drown
save
him
and
the
emperor
tiberius
shot
up
the
companion
as
if
launched
from
a
catapult
unused
to
engines
and
a
life
on
the
wave
frightened
by
the
of
the
motor
his
next
bound
would
have
carried
him
overboard
into
the
river
but
hanging
on
to
the
wheel
with
one
hand
with
the
other
i
seized
the
dog
by
the
collar
a
new
resplendent
collar
just
as
somebody
else
rushing
to
the
rescue
from
below
caught
him
by
the
tail
it
was
miss
van
buren
for
a
second
i
bending
down
she
stretching
up
our
faces
were
neighbors
and
i
had
time
to
see
her
expression
undergo
several
lightning
changes
surprise
incredulity
and
a
few
others
not
as
easy
to
read
before
she
retired
leaving
tibe
to
me
instead
of
coming
up
on
deck
as
she
had
evidently
intended
to
do
she
vanished
and
a
head
exquisitely
hatted
and
appeared
in
place
of
hers
a
moment
later
the
tiny
lady
of
the
arbor
transformed
into
parisian
elegance
by
an
effective
white
yachting
costume
with
a
coquettish
blue
on
her
gray
hair
the
goggling
effect
of
the
glasses
softened
by
the
floating
folds
of
azure
chiffon
arrived
to
succor
her
beloved
she
started
slightly
staring
at
me
through
veil
and
spectacles
and
i
deduced
that
whatever
starr
had
told
his
aunt
about
the
skipper
it
had
not
prepared
her
to
meet
the
man
of
the
arbor
those
hidden
eyes
recognized
me
and
took
in
the
situation
under
their
fire
i
realized
that
the
success
of
my
adventure
might
largely
depend
upon
the
chaperon
and
if
suspecting
something
more
than
met
her
gaze
she
should
strike
an
attitude
of
disapproval
she
could
prejudice
the
girls
against
the
skipper
and
so
manoeuver
that
he
had
his
trouble
for
his
pains
with
this
danger
ahead
i
redoubled
my
attentions
to
tiberius
but
it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
the
doubts
he
entertained
of
the
man
in
the
arbor
were
chased
away
by
gratitude
for
the
man
on
the
boat
if
it
had
not
been
so
such
is
the
primitive
sincerity
of
dog
kind
especially
bulldog
kind
no
bribe
in
my
power
to
offer
could
have
induced
him
to
dissimulate
i
knew
this
and
trembled
but
tibe
being
an
animal
of
parts
was
not
long
in
comprehending
that
the
hand
on
his
collar
meant
well
by
him
he
deigned
to
fawn
and
meeting
his
glance
at
close
quarters
i
read
his
through
the
depths
of
the
clear
eyes
after
that
moment
in
which
we
came
to
a
full
understanding
one
of
the
other
once
and
for
all
i
knew
that
tibe
wrinkled
mask
his
terrible
mouth
and
the
ferocious
tusks
standing
up
like
two
stalagmites
in
the
black
protruding
under
jaw
disguised
a
nature
almost
too
amiable
and
confiding
for
a
world
of
hypocrites
tragic
fate
to
seem
in
the
shallow
eyes
of
strangers
a
monster
of
evil
from
whom
to
flee
while
your
warm
heart
bursting
with
love
and
kindness
sends
you
chasing
those
who
avoid
you
eager
to
demonstrate
affection
such
a
fate
is
destined
to
be
tibe
so
long
as
he
may
live
but
in
this
first
instant
of
our
real
acquaintance
he
felt
that
i
at
least
saw
through
his
disguise
and
under
the
nose
and
spectacles
of
his
mistress
he
sealed
our
friendship
with
a
wet
kiss
on
my
sleeve
good
boy
said
i
and
meant
it
he
had
given
me
a
character
and
had
placed
me
upon
a
sound
footing
with
one
who
would
be
i
foresaw
a
power
on
lorelei
thank
you
much
said
she
with
the
promised
so
pronounced
in
her
accent
that
she
must
i
thought
have
spent
the
night
in
practising
it
she
then
carefully
selected
the
best
chair
and
took
from
another
a
blue
silk
cushion
which
matched
her
and
veil
as
she
sat
down
making
a
footstool
of
tibe
and
displaying
two
exquisitely
shod
feet
in
brand
new
suède
shoes
miss
rivers
appeared
pale
and
interesting
i
hope
you
better
my
poor
child
purred
the
chaperon
oh
thank
you
dear
lady
macnairne
i
shall
be
quite
right
now
started
this
interchange
of
civilities
told
that
the
mariner
aunt
fay
had
already
contrived
to
ingratiate
herself
with
her
charges
miss
rivers
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
closing
her
eyes
while
i
stood
aloof
and
turned
the
wheel
but
presently
the
languid
lashes
lifted
and
she
became
conscious
of
me
then
her
eyes
grew
big
she
remembered
me
from
the
day
at
the
prinzenhof
or
the
horse
show
perhaps
evidently
starr
had
not
named
me
yet
nor
had
miss
van
buren
in
descending
after
our
brief
encounter
put
any
questions
whether
this
boded
ill
or
well
i
could
not
decide
but
longed
to
get
suspense
over
and
i
was
not
kept
waiting
i
heard
starr
voice
below
urging
miss
van
buren
on
deck
do
bother
about
putting
everything
away
he
said
do
it
later
you
must
say
to
rotterdam
who
knows
what
will
have
happened
to
us
before
we
get
back
it
would
not
be
my
fault
if
two
of
the
party
were
not
engaged
i
was
thinking
hopefully
as
miss
van
buren
eyes
rising
from
below
like
stars
above
a
dark
horizon
met
mine
there
was
no
recognition
in
them
to
all
appearance
oblivious
of
ever
having
seen
my
insignificant
features
on
land
or
sea
she
came
smiling
up
on
the
friendliest
terms
with
starr
the
vacant
chair
most
conveniently
placed
for
her
was
close
to
the
wheel
and
i
hoped
that
she
would
take
it
but
rather
than
be
thus
trapped
she
stepped
over
tibe
and
pushed
past
her
stepsister
with
an
i
beg
your
pardon
dear
the
mariner
gave
no
glance
at
me
but
there
was
a
catch
in
his
voice
which
betokened
a
twinkle
of
the
eye
as
he
said
aunt
fay
miss
van
buren
and
miss
rivers
i
must
introduce
the
friend
i
told
you
about
our
skipper
jonkheer
brederode
miss
rivers
smiled
delightfully
with
just
such
a
flush
of
ingenuous
surprise
as
i
should
have
liked
to
see
on
another
face
why
how
curious
she
exclaimed
that
you
should
be
a
friend
of
starr
i
think
we
have
met
jonkheer
brederode
before
we
nell
we
sweetly
inquired
miss
van
buren
i
a
little
and
i
such
a
wretched
memory
for
faces
unless
i
notice
people
particularly
i
have
to
be
introduced
at
least
twice
before
it
occurs
to
me
to
bow
oh
but
protested
miss
rivers
surely
you
know
we
saw
no
brederode
with
your
cousin
at
the
museum
in
delft
and
then
afterwards
you
people
make
so
much
difference
remarked
miss
van
buren
oh
but
i
was
thinking
of
your
sea
adventure
so
much
as
when
jonkheer
brederode
rode
in
the
contest
i
afraid
i
was
looking
at
the
horses
cut
in
her
stepsister
if
robert
had
been
on
board
at
this
juncture
he
would
probably
have
wished
to
box
his
cousin
ears
but
i
had
no
such
desire
though
mine
were
tingling
in
fact
i
should
have
enjoyed
boxing
robert
for
i
saw
that
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
and
intentions
are
dangerous
weapons
my
friend
had
in
some
way
contrived
to
make
me
appear
insufferable
perhaps
he
given
the
impression
that
i
had
boasted
an
intention
to
meet
her
within
a
given
time
and
she
took
this
for
my
brutal
way
of
carrying
out
the
boast
what
is
a
jonkheer
the
lady
macnairne
demanded
of
starr
i
do
know
exactly
he
admitted
you
but
nephew
dear
how
can
you
help
knowing
when
you
have
an
friend
who
is
one
was
there
a
spice
of
malice
in
this
question
you
see
almost
ever
since
i
known
him
i
thought
of
him
as
alb
starr
explained
hastily
alb
is
a
kind
of
er
pet
name
i
suppose
it
means
something
nice
in
dutch
said
miss
rivers
in
the
soft
pretty
way
she
has
which
would
fain
make
every
one
around
her
happy
but
i
think
van
buren
told
us
that
was
like
our
baronet
jonkheer
instead
of
is
it
something
of
the
sort
i
answered
it
sticks
in
the
throat
if
you
excuse
me
for
saying
so
like
a
bit
of
crust
remarked
aunt
fay
you
can
all
call
him
alb
said
starr
why
not
compromise
with
skipper
asked
miss
van
buren
looking
at
my
rather
a
nice
one
with
serene
impertinence
we
shall
probably
never
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
him
on
land
so
why
stumble
over
dutch
names
or
titles
he
has
come
on
board
to
be
our
skipper
has
he
so
he
would
probably
prefer
to
be
starr
leaned
down
to
pat
tibe
shaking
all
over
ha
ha
ha
he
gasped
i
never
such
a
funny
tail
i
do
hope
it
is
going
to
give
me
hysterics
but
nobody
else
laughed
and
miss
rivers
was
gazing
at
her
stepsister
in
a
shocked
questioning
way
her
violet
eyes
saying
as
plainly
as
if
they
spoke
my
darling
girl
what
possesses
you
to
be
so
rude
to
an
inoffensive
foreigner
i
should
have
liked
to
ask
the
same
question
in
the
same
words
but
i
said
nothing
did
nothing
except
turn
the
wheel
with
the
air
of
that
miller
who
grinds
slowly
but
exceedingly
small
and
smile
a
hard
confident
smile
which
warned
the
enemy
oh
yes
you
going
to
know
me
on
land
and
love
me
on
land
so
you
might
as
well
make
up
your
mind
to
what
has
to
come
she
caught
the
look
which
forcibly
dragged
hers
down
from
my
and
i
am
convinced
that
she
read
its
meaning
it
made
her
hate
me
a
degree
worse
of
course
but
what
is
an
extra
stone
rolled
behind
the
doors
of
the
resisting
citadel
or
a
gallon
more
or
less
of
boiling
oil
to
dash
on
the
heads
of
the
besiegers
if
they
are
determined
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
fortunately
for
the
spirits
of
the
other
players
who
were
on
in
this
scene
in
a
subordinate
capacity
the
fair
enemy
was
not
of
the
nature
to
sulk
true
of
free
will
she
did
not
address
me
but
having
shown
her
opinion
of
and
intentions
toward
the
person
deserving
punishment
she
did
not
weary
her
arm
with
continued
castigation
instead
she
gave
herself
up
heart
and
soul
to
delight
in
her
first
taste
of
botoring
she
basked
in
it
she
reveled
in
it
had
she
been
a
kitten
i
think
she
would
have
purred
in
sheer
physical
enjoyment
of
it
boat
my
she
repeated
lingering
over
the
words
as
if
they
had
been
cream
and
sugar
oh
i
wonder
if
it
it
my
boat
i
wish
it
could
i
should
like
it
to
get
fond
of
me
i
alive
feel
its
heart
beat
what
tibe
is
to
lady
macnairne
is
going
to
be
to
me
we
never
lived
before
did
we
phil
and
are
you
glad
we
came
who
knows
what
will
become
of
us
after
this
for
we
certainly
never
can
go
home
again
and
take
up
life
where
we
left
it
off
you
sha
i
see
to
that
i
said
to
myself
but
this
time
she
was
not
looking
even
at
the
brim
of
my
cap
her
eyes
luminous
with
childlike
happiness
searched
and
photographed
each
new
feature
of
that
skimmed
swiftly
past
us
we
might
become
pirates
she
went
on
there
be
no
about
that
and
i
dare
say
we
could
make
a
living
hoist
the
black
flag
whenever
we
came
to
a
nice
lonely
stretch
of
water
with
a
barge
or
two
or
a
fine
country
house
on
shore
and
the
work
would
begin
tibe
would
terrorize
our
victims
but
speaking
of
the
black
flag
i
see
the
banner
floats
the
deck
of
the
free
and
the
cabins
of
the
brave
how
charming
of
you
to
think
of
putting
it
there
starr
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
it
would
have
been
charming
if
it
occurred
to
me
said
the
mariner
but
it
did
perhaps
our
skipper
can
explain
the
mystery
remarked
the
chaperon
graciously
i
smiled
i
happened
to
have
the
little
silk
flag
said
i
and
as
the
owner
of
the
boat
is
an
american
i
took
the
liberty
of
flying
her
colors
from
the
mast
they
went
up
early
this
morning
but
we
have
another
flag
with
us
for
emergencies
that
of
my
sailing
and
rowing
club
which
when
we
show
it
will
give
us
the
right
to
enter
sluices
or
locks
as
you
call
them
ahead
of
anything
else
alb
you
have
your
uses
observed
the
mariner
why
ca
we
keep
your
flag
up
all
the
time
under
the
stars
and
stripes
it
would
be
fair
to
make
use
of
it
except
in
extreme
cases
i
said
all
these
lighter
and
bargemen
whom
we
see
have
their
living
to
get
time
money
to
them
while
it
pleasure
to
us
it
right
that
they
should
get
through
ahead
when
they
first
comers
but
there
may
be
occasions
when
we
shall
need
our
advantage
and
till
then
i
keep
the
flag
up
my
sleeve
with
your
permission
i
never
thought
to
feel
so
on
a
exclaimed
miss
rivers
since
we
made
up
our
minds
to
come
or
rather
nell
made
up
hers
i
added
another
prayer
to
those
i
been
accustomed
to
say
for
years
that
we
should
blow
up
or
if
we
to
blow
up
that
we
should
realize
long
enough
beforehand
to
be
frightened
and
that
we
should
blow
into
quite
little
pieces
which
could
know
anything
about
it
afterwards
but
now
i
such
a
peaceful
feeling
i
have
to
make
myself
remember
that
any
instant
may
be
my
last
i
would
try
said
miss
van
buren
i
suppose
when
one
thinks
of
it
worse
things
could
happen
to
one
on
a
than
in
a
because
there
water
all
round
but
it
seems
so
heavenly
restful
rather
like
motoring
in
heaven
might
be
and
no
frightened
horses
or
barking
dogs
or
street
children
to
worry
you
i
pity
people
on
steamboats
just
as
the
other
day
when
we
motored
i
pitied
people
in
stuffy
black
trains
said
miss
rivers
but
i
pity
the
people
on
lighters
and
barges
do
they
look
delightful
i
should
love
to
live
on
that
one
with
the
red
lion
on
the
prow
and
the
green
house
with
white
embroidered
curtains
and
and
sweet
little
china
animals
in
the
windows
it
called
maria
and
oh
it
worked
by
a
lots
of
them
are
nowadays
i
said
they
easy
to
rig
up
and
save
work
i
happen
to
know
maria
and
the
lady
she
named
after
who
lives
on
board
and
thinks
herself
the
happiest
woman
on
earth
or
water
there
she
goes
on
her
way
to
the
kitchen
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
pretty
creatures
both
are
they
pictures
cried
miss
rivers
and
her
stepsister
who
at
the
moment
was
being
particularly
nice
to
the
mariner
i
fancy
by
way
of
showing
the
outcast
how
nice
she
can
be
to
others
glanced
up
from
a
map
of
holland
which
starr
had
opened
across
his
knees
it
like
a
very
young
madonna
and
child
painted
by
a
dutch
master
i
wish
you
could
introduce
us
perhaps
i
will
when
we
come
back
this
way
said
i
you
shall
go
on
board
and
have
tea
with
anna
maria
and
her
baby
and
the
husband
too
who
as
as
the
rest
of
the
family
they
would
be
delighted
and
proud
to
show
off
their
floating
home
which
saved
anna
maria
life
how
it
sounds
like
a
story
so
it
is
a
humble
romance
anna
maria
the
daughter
of
a
bargeman
and
was
born
and
brought
up
on
a
barge
when
she
was
seventeen
and
keeping
for
her
father
the
mother
died
when
she
was
a
child
the
poor
man
had
an
accident
and
was
drowned
there
was
much
money
saved
up
for
anna
maria
so
the
barge
was
sold
and
she
had
to
live
on
dry
land
and
learn
how
to
be
a
dressmaker
she
was
as
miserable
as
a
goldfish
would
be
if
you
took
it
out
of
its
bowl
and
laid
it
on
the
table
in
a
few
months
she
fallen
into
a
decline
and
though
just
at
that
time
she
met
a
dashing
young
chauffeur
who
took
a
fancy
to
her
pretty
pale
face
even
love
was
strong
enough
to
save
her
the
chauffeur
poor
fellow
thought
there
was
no
flower
in
the
garden
of
girls
as
sweet
as
his
white
snowdrop
he
felt
if
he
could
only
afford
to
buy
a
lighter
for
himself
they
might
marry
and
the
bride
life
might
be
saved
but
it
was
out
of
the
question
and
perhaps
the
idyl
would
have
ended
in
tragedy
had
he
not
confided
his
troubles
to
his
master
that
master
as
it
happened
had
a
lighter
which
he
fitted
up
with
a
motor
he
used
it
all
summer
and
got
his
money
worth
of
fun
out
of
it
so
when
he
heard
the
story
he
told
the
chauffeur
he
would
give
him
the
thing
as
it
stood
for
a
wedding
present
and
it
must
be
rechristened
maria
what
a
lamb
of
a
master
i
quite
love
him
exclaimed
miss
van
buren
before
she
remembered
that
she
was
talking
to
one
beyond
the
pale
there
was
much
merit
he
was
tired
of
his
toy
i
answered
carelessly
but
i
felt
my
face
grow
red
i
do
believe
it
a
bit
he
just
said
that
cried
miss
rivers
i
should
love
him
too
is
he
a
dutchman
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
was
half
english
half
dutch
remarked
starr
or
if
he
was
making
our
wheel
go
round
now
finished
aunt
fay
pulling
tibe
ear
oh
said
miss
van
buren
and
buried
her
nose
in
the
map
she
and
starr
were
tracing
or
pretending
to
trace
our
route
to
gouda
whither
we
were
going
and
where
we
expected
to
lunch
hurriedly
she
threw
herself
into
a
discussion
with
him
as
to
whether
we
were
now
in
the
lek
or
the
maas
reason
said
maas
but
the
map
said
lek
though
it
was
a
thing
thought
the
lady
about
which
there
could
be
no
two
opinions
it
must
be
one
or
the
other
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
many
opinions
and
as
i
knew
the
history
of
the
dispute
after
all
she
had
to
turn
to
me
and
listen
i
talked
to
starr
and
at
her
explaining
how
only
experts
could
tell
one
river
from
another
here
and
even
experts
differed
our
waters
are
split
up
into
so
many
channels
that
they
as
difficult
to
separate
one
from
the
other
as
the
twisted
strands
in
a
plait
of
hair
said
i
it
was
like
napoleon
colossal
cheek
was
it
to
claim
the
netherlands
for
france
because
they
were
formed
from
the
alluvium
of
french
rivers
instantly
the
chaperon
ceased
to
admire
tibe
new
and
expensive
collar
and
opened
a
silver
chain
bag
also
glittering
with
newness
which
she
had
in
her
lap
from
this
she
brought
forth
a
of
russia
leather
and
began
to
write
with
a
stylographic
pen
which
had
dangled
in
a
gold
case
on
a
richly
furnished
chatelaine
this
little
lady
had
done
herself
well
since
yesterday
i
shall
take
notes
of
everything
she
announced
that
bit
about
napoleon
goes
down
first
surely
you
knew
aunt
fay
said
the
mariner
with
a
warning
in
his
lifted
eyebrows
i
do
know
anything
about
holland
except
that
it
flat
and
wet
she
replied
defying
him
as
she
can
afford
to
do
now
that
once
an
aunt
she
must
be
always
an
aunt
as
far
as
this
tour
is
concerned
it
not
the
fashion
in
part
of
scotland
for
ladies
of
position
to
know
things
about
foreign
countries
they
not
visited
it
considered
frumpish
and
though
i
may
not
be
as
young
as
i
once
was
i
am
frumpish
she
certainly
is
not
the
real
lady
macnairne
does
not
dress
as
smartly
or
have
such
an
air
of
parisian
elegance
as
this
mysterious
little
upstart
has
put
on
since
assuming
her
part
save
for
the
gray
hair
and
the
hideous
glasses
there
could
scarcely
be
a
daintier
figure
than
that
of
the
mariner
false
aunt
fay
however
she
went
on
my
doctor
has
recommended
a
tonic
and
i
should
wonder
if
a
spice
of
information
might
be
a
mental
stimulant
anyhow
i
intend
to
try
it
and
ask
questions
of
everybody
about
everything
all
this
she
said
with
a
quaint
air
and
i
began
to
be
impressed
with
the
curious
fascination
which
emanates
from
this
strange
small
person
i
am
in
her
secret
i
know
she
is
a
fraud
though
of
all
else
concerning
her
i
am
in
ignorance
perhaps
blissful
ignorance
i
have
none
too
much
respect
for
the
little
wretch
despite
her
gray
hairs
yet
somehow
i
felt
at
this
moment
that
i
was
her
i
was
afraid
that
if
she
asked
any
favor
of
me
i
should
run
to
do
it
and
i
could
imagine
myself
being
ass
enough
to
quail
before
the
liliputian
displeasure
as
for
starr
i
could
see
that
he
dared
not
say
his
soul
was
his
own
if
she
laid
claim
to
it
he
might
raise
his
eyebrows
or
telegraph
with
his
eyelids
but
a
certain
note
in
that
crisp
voice
would
reduce
him
to
complete
subjection
in
what
our
german
cousins
call
an
no
wonder
that
tiberius
who
looks
as
if
he
could
play
lion
to
her
martyr
without
a
single
rehearsal
fawns
crawls
and
wriggles
like
the
merest
puppy
at
the
lifting
of
her
tiny
finger
when
she
wills
as
is
seldom
to
be
obeyed
by
him
all
must
feel
the
same
queer
power
in
the
woman
be
we
dogs
or
men
well
i
glad
you
got
your
country
back
from
napoleon
said
miss
rivers
nobody
except
the
dutch
could
have
made
it
so
cozy
so
radiantly
clean
and
comfortable
little
holland
i
laughed
dear
little
holland
yes
that
the
way
you
all
pet
and
patronize
our
hollow
land
and
chuck
it
under
the
chin
so
to
speak
you
think
of
it
as
a
nice
little
toy
country
to
come
and
play
with
and
laugh
at
for
its
quaintness
and
why
should
you
but
it
strikes
us
netherlanders
as
funny
that
point
of
view
of
yours
if
we
have
a
sense
of
humor
and
we
have
sometimes
you
see
we
a
good
memory
for
our
past
we
know
what
we
built
upon
think
of
the
making
of
holland
though
i
grant
you
it
difficult
when
you
look
at
this
peaceful
landscape
but
try
to
call
up
something
as
different
as
darkness
is
to
light
forget
the
river
and
the
houses
and
the
pretty
branching
canals
and
see
nothing
but
marshes
wild
and
terrible
with
sluggish
rivers
crawling
through
to
the
sea
beaten
back
by
fierce
tides
to
overflow
into
oozy
meers
and
stagnant
pools
think
of
raging
winds
never
still
the
howling
of
seas
and
the
driving
of
pitiless
rains
no
other
views
but
those
and
no
definite
forms
rising
out
of
the
water
save
great
forest
trees
growing
so
densely
that
no
daylight
shines
through
the
black
roof
of
branches
imagine
the
life
of
our
forefathers
who
fled
here
from
an
existence
so
much
more
dreadful
that
they
clung
to
the
and
fought
for
them
a
battle
with
the
sea
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
netherlands
as
it
was
of
venice
and
the
fugitives
built
as
the
venetians
built
on
piles
with
wattles
if
you
seen
venice
often
be
reminded
of
it
here
and
what
rest
have
we
had
since
those
beginnings
if
not
fighting
the
sea
we
had
to
fight
spain
and
england
and
even
now
our
battles
are
over
they
never
will
be
while
we
keep
our
heads
above
water
every
hour
of
every
day
and
night
some
one
is
fighting
to
save
the
netherlands
from
the
fate
of
atlantis
while
her
men
fight
she
safe
but
if
they
rested
this
comfortable
little
country
would
be
blotted
out
under
the
waters
as
so
many
provinces
vanished
under
the
zuider
zee
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
others
at
other
times
have
been
swept
away
do
you
think
our
could
ride
on
the
flood
and
drag
if
any
of
the
most
important
dykes
or
dams
happened
to
burst
inquired
the
chaperon
i
hope
so
for
what
you
been
saying
makes
one
feel
exactly
like
a
female
member
of
the
ark
party
everybody
laughed
but
her
joke
pricked
me
to
shame
of
my
harangue
nothing
will
to
burst
i
assured
her
we
dutch
do
lose
our
sleep
over
such
every
country
has
something
to
dread
it
drought
in
india
earthquakes
in
italy
cyclones
and
blizzards
in
america
and
so
on
our
menace
is
water
but
then
it
our
friend
as
well
as
foe
and
we
subdued
it
to
our
daily
uses
as
every
canal
we
pass
can
prove
besides
there
something
else
we
able
to
do
with
it
the
popular
belief
is
that
at
amsterdam
one
key
is
kept
in
the
central
arsenal
which
can
instantly
throw
open
sluices
to
inundate
the
whole
country
in
case
we
should
be
in
danger
of
invasion
but
you
drown
your
land
and
yourselves
as
well
as
the
enemy
exclaimed
aunt
fay
better
drown
than
lose
the
liberty
we
paid
for
with
so
much
blood
the
old
spirit
in
us
still
i
hope
though
we
may
seem
fellows
in
everyday
life
when
we
make
up
our
minds
to
do
a
thing
we
prepared
to
suffer
for
the
sake
of
carrying
it
through
again
i
met
miss
van
buren
eyes
and
i
think
she
realized
that
i
am
typically
dutch
xi
rotterdam
lay
far
behind
us
now
we
passed
the
busy
crowded
as
thickly
lined
with
barges
and
lighters
as
streets
with
houses
and
were
nearing
the
point
where
the
river
disguised
as
the
issel
turns
with
many
curves
toward
gouda
we
had
a
few
whiffs
from
brickfields
and
other
ugly
industries
that
scar
the
banks
but
the
windings
of
the
issel
bore
us
swiftly
to
regions
of
grassy
meadows
and
waving
reeds
threatening
sometimes
to
lose
us
in
strange
of
water
more
like
separate
lakes
and
round
ponds
than
the
flowing
reaches
of
a
river
here
the
despised
albatross
was
worth
his
weight
in
gold
in
charge
of
a
skipper
not
familiar
with
every
foot
of
the
lorelei
and
waterspin
would
have
been
aground
more
than
once
even
that
irresponsible
mariner
guessed
at
the
snares
we
avoided
and
flung
me
a
word
of
appreciation
you
earning
your
salt
said
he
and
you
shall
have
a
little
at
gouda
but
as
to
gouda
a
struggle
was
going
on
between
my
inclination
and
my
conscience
it
was
my
duty
as
skipper
to
take
lorelei
through
the
town
that
she
might
be
ready
to
start
from
the
other
side
after
luncheon
there
would
be
delays
at
and
time
would
be
lost
if
the
party
remained
on
board
and
tried
to
see
the
place
afterwards
if
i
trusted
hendrik
to
act
as
captain
and
chauffeur
in
one
something
would
go
wrong
and
i
should
be
blamed
nevertheless
i
did
not
relish
the
thought
of
seeing
starr
march
off
in
triumph
with
the
ladies
while
i
remained
behind
to
work
and
lunch
on
a
cheese
sandwich
i
was
tempted
to
shift
responsibility
upon
hendrik
shoulders
and
on
other
days
to
come
but
as
we
slowed
up
for
the
sluice
or
lock
something
inside
me
would
have
no
to
be
sure
i
am
playing
my
part
for
a
purpose
but
while
i
play
it
i
must
play
well
and
it
was
the
conscientious
captain
who
advised
his
passengers
to
get
out
told
them
how
to
find
the
best
inn
and
what
they
were
to
see
when
they
had
lunched
the
hotel
is
in
the
markt
platz
i
said
and
you
must
have
a
good
look
at
the
old
weigh
house
while
you
on
the
spot
it
will
be
your
first
weigh
house
and
it
really
a
good
one
with
a
splendid
relief
by
eggers
and
a
delightful
outside
staircase
then
there
the
stadhuis
too
and
if
you
care
for
old
stained
glass
the
work
of
the
brothers
crabeth
in
the
groote
kerk
but
are
you
going
with
us
asked
miss
rivers
i
explained
why
i
could
not
oh
dear
and
we
ca
speak
dutch
she
sighed
fancy
a
procession
straggling
through
a
strange
town
wanting
to
know
everything
and
not
able
to
utter
a
word
nonsense
phil
we
can
get
on
perfectly
well
said
miss
van
buren
i
learned
things
out
of
the
you
expect
a
skipper
to
be
a
guide
as
well
this
was
a
stab
and
i
think
it
pleased
her
but
i
laughed
i
shall
often
be
able
to
go
with
you
i
hope
miss
rivers
i
said
in
many
places
the
boat
will
start
from
the
same
spot
where
she
gets
in
then
i
shall
be
free
and
at
your
service
i
had
to
see
them
off
without
me
miss
van
buren
walking
with
starr
and
the
only
one
who
threw
me
a
backward
glance
was
tibe
but
the
task
i
had
before
me
was
easier
than
i
expected
there
were
fewer
barges
in
waiting
than
on
most
days
here
and
there
a
tip
to
a
a
gulden
stuck
conspicuously
in
my
eye
like
a
silver
monocle
just
long
enough
to
suggest
a
different
destination
worked
wonders
and
in
an
hour
i
had
piloted
lorelei
through
the
of
gouda
ready
to
take
her
passengers
again
on
the
leiden
side
standing
at
the
wheel
i
had
eaten
a
sandwich
and
drunk
a
glass
of
beer
brought
by
hendrik
so
there
was
no
need
to
seek
food
in
the
town
the
others
having
finished
lunch
would
have
begun
and
if
i
strolled
to
the
groote
kerk
it
was
just
possible
i
might
find
something
even
more
desirable
than
the
exquisite
glass
they
have
saved
the
church
for
the
last
i
said
to
myself
i
should
like
to
see
her
face
while
she
looks
at
the
haarlem
window
i
could
not
have
calculated
more
exactly
had
we
made
an
appointment
as
i
arrived
within
sight
of
the
verger
door
i
saw
the
party
going
in
there
was
a
moment
pause
and
then
all
save
one
disappeared
that
figure
was
starr
and
he
was
left
in
charge
of
the
dog
hullo
he
exclaimed
you
just
in
time
yes
said
i
clever
was
i
i
mean
in
time
to
play
with
this
brute
while
i
go
in
he
be
pleased
with
the
exchange
besides
you
seen
the
church
and
i
have
i
never
seen
it
in
such
companionship
albatross
you
unconsecrate
the
church
for
miss
van
buren
ca
you
see
she
have
none
of
you
i
shall
need
the
more
time
to
make
her
change
her
mind
every
minute
counts
au
revoir
do
let
tibe
escape
or
i
pity
you
with
your
i
wish
he
jump
into
the
nearest
canal
look
here
gouda
a
fraud
we
had
a
loathsome
lunch
cold
ham
and
pappy
bread
with
paper
napkins
and
the
whole
meal
served
on
one
plate
by
a
female
even
my
aunt
was
afraid
of
there
is
a
cow
within
miles
much
less
a
cow
with
a
coat
perhaps
one
may
pass
while
you
wait
ta
ta
your
turn
will
come
soon
and
i
left
him
glaring
at
tibe
and
muttering
threats
of
revenge
against
me
all
the
windows
of
the
gouda
church
are
beautiful
but
the
haarlem
window
would
warm
the
coldest
heart
and
i
was
not
surprised
to
find
miss
van
buren
already
gazing
at
it
a
lovely
light
streaming
through
the
old
glass
upon
her
uplifted
face
she
is
a
girl
to
find
out
the
best
things
at
once
by
instinct
there
she
stood
lost
in
delight
and
when
i
assuming
more
boldness
than
i
felt
walked
quietly
across
the
church
and
stopped
close
behind
her
she
threw
just
enough
of
a
look
at
the
to
see
that
it
was
a
tallish
man
in
gray
is
that
you
mr
starr
she
asked
but
sure
that
no
stranger
would
approach
so
near
and
believing
me
at
a
safe
distance
she
took
the
answer
for
granted
what
a
fairyland
in
glass
there
is
in
this
church
she
went
on
joyously
what
skies
and
backgrounds
of
medieval
castles
and
towers
and
what
luminous
colors
i
love
to
be
one
of
those
little
red
and
yellow
men
looking
out
of
the
tower
at
the
battle
going
on
below
among
the
queer
ships
wallowing
in
the
crisp
waves
and
live
always
in
that
fantastic
glass
country
i
want
to
know
what
inside
the
tower
do
you
which
man
will
you
choose
to
be
the
one
on
your
right
side
said
i
quietly
then
she
whisked
round
and
blushed
with
vexation
that
you
could
be
she
flung
at
me
and
walked
away
but
i
followed
wo
you
tell
me
why
i
asked
what
have
i
done
to
offend
you
if
you
do
know
i
could
make
you
understand
perhaps
it
you
who
do
understand
but
you
will
some
day
oh
i
no
curiosity
am
i
spoiling
your
trip
i
not
going
to
let
you
thanks
then
you
better
let
me
help
to
make
it
pleasanter
i
can
in
many
ways
i
do
need
help
in
enjoying
holland
i
intend
to
enjoy
it
every
instant
in
in
wo
you
finish
in
spite
of
you
i
vow
it
shall
be
partly
because
of
me
you
very
fond
of
vowing
then
at
last
i
knew
where
i
stood
i
knew
that
robert
said
something
into
the
midst
of
this
crisis
dropped
miss
rivers
no
doubt
she
had
seen
the
expression
on
our
faces
and
intervened
in
pure
to
snatch
me
as
a
brand
from
the
burning
for
she
threw
herself
into
talk
about
the
church
crying
out
against
the
hideous
havoc
we
protestants
had
wrought
with
whitewash
and
crude
woodwork
i
not
catholic
not
a
bit
catholic
though
i
may
be
a
little
high
church
but
i
have
spoiled
everything
just
for
the
sake
of
getting
a
place
to
worship
in
cheap
without
having
to
put
up
a
new
building
why
it
like
then
my
lady
flashed
out
at
her
unexpectedly
and
saved
me
an
answer
where
your
imagination
phil
it
must
have
gone
or
you
could
put
yourself
into
the
place
of
these
people
and
see
why
they
tore
away
the
pictures
and
statues
and
hid
every
bit
of
color
with
whitewash
i
love
beauty
but
i
would
have
done
as
they
did
color
in
churches
was
to
them
the
of
their
nearest
and
dearest
splashed
upon
the
walls
those
statues
those
pictured
saints
they
pulled
down
or
covered
up
had
smiled
on
persecution
they
had
to
have
a
kind
of
frenzied
to
get
out
the
smell
of
incense
oh
i
know
how
they
felt
when
they
did
it
as
if
i
been
here
myself
with
a
broom
full
of
whitewash
perhaps
some
ancestress
of
yours
was
here
and
did
some
sweeping
said
i
but
it
was
a
mistake
for
me
to
speak
she
froze
in
an
instant
and
suggested
that
if
everybody
had
seen
enough
we
should
go
out
and
give
poor
starr
a
chance
i
stop
and
show
him
the
haarlem
window
said
she
and
i
hated
starr
perhaps
that
was
the
state
of
mind
she
wished
to
create
at
all
events
her
eyes
retained
the
exaltation
of
the
whitewashing
nor
should
i
wonder
if
those
two
enjoyed
the
thought
that
i
was
kept
waiting
outside
as
much
as
they
enjoyed
roaming
together
in
glass
country
in
any
case
they
stayed
so
long
that
we
were
able
to
visit
a
shop
near
by
and
come
back
before
they
reappeared
it
was
a
nice
shop
where
sweets
and
cakes
were
sold
especially
the
rich
treacle
cookies
for
which
gouda
is
celebrated
there
was
much
brass
there
were
jars
and
boxes
painted
curiously
and
we
were
served
by
an
old
lady
in
a
white
cap
whom
miss
rivers
and
the
chaperon
thought
adorable
we
bought
as
well
as
cookies
because
they
wanted
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
national
sweets
of
holland
and
afterwards
when
miss
van
buren
was
given
some
she
pronounced
them
nothing
but
the
caramellest
caramels
she
had
ever
tasted
she
and
starr
had
developed
a
pleasant
private
understanding
which
comprised
jokes
too
subtle
to
be
understood
by
outsiders
and
as
the
mariner
and
i
were
shoulder
to
shoulder
for
a
moment
on
our
way
back
to
the
boat
he
gave
me
a
look
charged
with
meaning
who
laughs
last
laughs
best
he
quoted
and
inwardly
i
could
not
but
agree
though
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
tibe
attracted
enormous
attention
in
gouda
as
we
walked
along
shady
streets
lit
by
the
clear
shining
of
canals
children
ran
after
us
as
at
hamlin
they
ran
after
the
pied
piper
if
for
one
instant
the
strangers
paused
to
study
a
beautiful
carved
door
or
to
peer
into
the
window
of
an
antiquary
at
blue
and
white
jars
or
to
gaze
up
at
the
ferocious
head
of
a
turk
over
a
chemist
shop
or
to
laugh
at
a
house
with
painted
in
red
and
white
diamonds
a
crowd
of
flaxen
heads
collected
round
us
little
hands
fluttered
over
the
dog
wrinkled
head
as
butterflies
flit
about
a
clover
blossom
baby
laughter
tinkled
and
tiny
shrieks
cut
the
stillness
of
the
sleepy
summer
afternoon
it
was
all
so
to
miss
van
buren
that
she
declared
incredulity
in
holland
real
existence
there
is
no
such
country
she
said
and
worse
than
all
i
have
no
nevertheless
a
shape
which
closely
resembled
lorelei
was
floating
like
a
white
on
a
green
calyx
of
canal
in
the
place
where
i
had
or
dreamed
that
i
had
left
her
an
hour
ago
and
having
assembled
on
board
that
white
apparition
we
started
or
dreamed
that
we
started
for
leiden
a
place
where
i
hoped
to
score
a
point
or
two
with
my
lady
the
boisterous
wind
of
the
early
morning
had
dropped
at
noon
leaving
the
day
hot
and
unrefreshed
with
no
breath
of
air
stirring
but
on
the
water
traveling
at
eight
or
nine
miles
an
hour
we
forgot
the
heavy
july
heat
which
on
shore
had
burned
our
faces
they
were
fanned
by
a
constant
breeze
of
our
own
making
which
tossed
us
a
bouquet
of
perfume
from
flowery
fields
as
we
slipped
by
the
only
sound
in
our
ears
the
cry
of
gulls
overhead
and
the
delicate
fluting
of
the
water
as
our
bows
shattered
its
crystals
among
pale
shimmery
sedges
and
tall
reeds
tiny
canals
of
irrigation
wandered
like
azure
veins
through
a
maze
of
blossoming
pink
and
gold
in
the
meadows
and
as
far
as
the
most
sweeping
glance
could
reach
the
horizon
seemed
pinned
down
to
earth
with
windmills
suddenly
the
land
lay
far
below
the
level
of
the
canal
and
people
walking
in
the
main
streets
of
villages
behind
the
dykes
were
visible
for
us
only
as
far
as
their
knees
quaint
little
houses
had
sat
themselves
down
close
to
the
water
edge
as
if
determined
to
miss
no
detail
of
canal
gossip
and
from
their
bright
windows
like
brilliant
eyes
they
watched
the
water
with
a
curious
expression
of
and
contentment
on
their
painted
wooden
faces
on
verandas
half
as
big
as
the
houses
themselves
the
life
of
the
family
went
on
children
played
young
girls
wrote
letters
to
their
lovers
mothers
busily
worked
but
saw
everything
that
passed
on
the
water
fathers
read
newspapers
and
old
grandpapas
nodded
over
pipes
every
garden
blazed
with
color
and
rows
of
trees
with
their
branches
cut
and
trained
as
miss
van
buren
said
flat
as
trees
for
paper
dolls
shaded
the
upper
windows
of
the
toy
mansions
little
things
which
were
matters
of
every
day
for
me
in
this
country
so
characteristic
of
the
netherlands
tickled
the
fancy
of
the
strangers
and
kept
them
constantly
exclaiming
the
extravagantly
polished
wood
of
the
house
doors
the
lifting
cranes
protruding
from
the
gables
the
dairymen
in
boats
with
their
shining
pails
the
bridges
that
pivoted
round
to
let
us
pass
through
the
drawbridges
that
opened
in
the
middle
and
swung
up
with
leisured
dignity
the
bridgeman
in
coats
collecting
tolls
in
battered
wooden
shoes
suspended
from
long
lines
the
dogs
which
they
call
spitz
and
are
really
kees
who
barked
ferociously
at
our
motor
from
every
barge
and
lighter
the
yellow
carts
with
black
hoods
from
which
peasant
heads
peered
curiously
out
at
us
from
shore
and
above
all
the
old
women
or
young
children
with
ropes
across
their
breasts
straining
to
tow
enormous
barges
like
great
dark
following
whales
what
can
dutchmen
be
like
to
let
them
do
it
while
they
loaf
on
board
miss
van
buren
flashed
at
me
as
if
i
were
responsible
for
the
faults
of
all
my
male
countrymen
it
is
exactly
loafing
to
steer
those
big
barges
said
i
and
the
whole
family
take
turns
anywhere
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
a
hundred
they
do
know
what
hard
work
it
is
because
nobody
has
told
them
and
our
river
people
are
among
the
most
contented
starr
was
interested
in
seeing
me
salute
the
men
of
passing
craft
and
in
their
grave
return
of
the
courtesy
soon
he
could
imitate
my
motion
though
he
exaggerated
it
slightly
letting
his
arm
float
gracefully
out
to
full
length
before
it
came
back
to
his
cap
somewhat
as
he
remarked
like
a
blown
by
the
wind
when
he
had
got
the
knack
he
was
enchanted
and
every
yacht
lighter
and
barge
had
a
theatrical
greeting
from
him
as
it
slipped
silently
past
perhaps
never
to
be
seen
again
by
our
eyes
but
are
they
happy
he
asked
you
never
hear
bursts
of
laughter
or
chattering
of
voices
as
you
would
in
other
countries
the
youngest
children
faces
are
grave
while
as
for
the
men
they
look
as
if
they
were
paid
so
much
a
day
not
to
shed
a
smile
and
were
mighty
conscientious
about
earning
their
money
yet
you
say
they
contented
we
dutch
are
a
reserved
people
i
explained
under
miss
van
critical
gaze
we
do
make
much
noise
when
we
glad
or
sad
and
it
takes
something
funny
to
make
us
laugh
we
do
do
it
to
hear
the
sound
of
our
own
voices
but
prefer
to
rest
our
features
and
our
minds
some
of
these
bargemen
look
as
if
they
rested
their
minds
so
much
that
vegetables
had
grown
on
them
mused
starr
which
made
miss
van
buren
giggle
and
somehow
i
was
angry
with
her
for
finding
wit
in
his
small
sallies
you
discover
on
this
trip
that
as
you
treat
the
dutch
so
will
they
treat
you
i
went
on
if
you
impatient
they
be
rude
if
you
show
contempt
they
pay
you
back
in
the
same
coin
but
if
polite
and
considerate
there
nothing
they
wo
do
for
you
in
their
quiet
way
we
shall
never
be
rude
to
any
of
them
shall
we
nell
said
miss
rivers
not
unless
they
deserve
it
came
back
the
answer
and
i
knew
what
dutchman
in
particular
miss
van
buren
had
in
mind
it
was
about
two
hours
from
gouda
when
a
blaze
of
color
leaped
from
the
distant
level
to
our
eyes
and
everybody
cried
out
in
admiration
for
little
boskoop
which
in
summer
is
always
among
garlands
and
bowers
of
bloom
the
rhododendrons
that
last
longer
with
us
than
in
england
like
all
other
flowers
were
beautiful
with
a
clinging
to
the
glory
of
their
youth
and
the
tall
straight
flame
of
azaleas
shot
up
from
every
against
a
background
of
roses
roses
white
and
red
and
amber
roses
pale
pink
and
the
crimson
that
is
purple
in
shadow
miss
rivers
thought
she
would
like
to
live
there
and
cultivate
flowers
but
i
told
her
that
she
had
better
not
negotiate
for
the
purchase
of
a
house
until
she
had
seen
the
miles
of
blossom
at
haarlem
we
had
not
kept
up
our
average
of
speed
to
nine
miles
an
hour
for
though
we
made
ten
when
the
way
was
clear
and
no
yards
of
regulation
to
get
tangled
in
our
the
custom
of
these
waterways
is
to
slow
down
near
villages
and
in
farming
country
besides
we
met
barges
loaded
to
the
water
edge
and
had
we
been
going
fast
our
wash
would
have
swamped
them
as
it
was
we
flung
a
wave
over
the
low
dykes
and
sent
boats
moored
at
the
foot
of
garden
steps
knocking
against
their
in
fear
at
our
approach
but
after
alphen
we
turned
into
a
green
stream
so
evidently
not
a
canal
that
aunt
fay
was
moved
to
ask
questions
her
face
fell
when
she
heard
it
was
the
rhine
what
the
rhine
she
echoed
it
no
wider
than
than
the
thames
at
marlow
i
was
there
last
summer
you
stayed
with
lady
marchant
broke
in
starr
hastily
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
cut
her
short
and
the
little
masquerader
bristled
under
the
treatment
oh
yes
that
was
when
you
were
painting
my
portrait
was
it
starr
flushed
and
i
guessed
why
remembering
his
salon
success
and
recalling
that
it
was
his
portrait
of
lady
macnairne
which
had
been
exhibited
this
year
of
course
i
had
been
stupid
not
to
put
the
two
facts
together
and
realize
that
his
success
and
her
portrait
must
have
been
one
and
the
same
the
girls
had
probably
heard
of
it
and
must
be
asking
themselves
at
this
moment
how
a
portrait
of
this
little
spectacled
thing
could
have
been
possible
cruel
aunt
fay
somehow
she
must
have
known
that
the
face
of
her
had
been
painted
and
exhibited
by
starr
and
she
was
enjoying
his
misery
as
bad
boys
enjoy
the
wrigglings
of
butterflies
on
pins
in
pity
i
stepped
in
to
the
rescue
and
began
again
before
a
question
about
the
portrait
could
fall
from
the
lips
of
miss
rivers
on
which
i
saw
it
trembling
it
the
rhine
for
no
particular
reason
i
said
it
quite
arbitrary
farther
on
it
the
oude
rhine
farther
still
the
krommer
or
crooked
rhine
but
if
you
think
little
of
it
here
you
despise
it
at
katwyk
where
its
end
is
so
ignominious
that
it
has
to
be
pumped
into
the
sea
i
do
think
that
ignominious
said
the
chaperon
i
suppose
it
does
choose
to
go
into
the
sea
it
would
rather
rest
after
its
labors
and
lie
down
in
a
pleasant
pool
to
dream
about
where
it
rose
on
the
splugen
or
about
the
way
it
poured
out
of
lake
constance
and
went
roaring
over
the
rocks
at
schaffhausen
to
wind
on
among
hilly
vineyards
and
ruined
castles
past
the
drachenfels
and
cologne
if
they
choose
to
pump
it
against
its
will
that
affair
at
least
that
how
should
feel
if
i
were
the
rhine
how
scotch
of
you
aunt
fay
exclaimed
starr
fervently
but
he
looked
worried
and
i
wondered
if
he
had
told
the
girls
that
lady
macnairne
had
never
been
much
abroad
evidently
her
double
has
traveled
and
remembered
what
she
saw
i
am
not
curious
concerning
other
affairs
but
i
confess
i
should
like
to
know
something
of
aunt
past
for
she
seems
so
ignorant
of
some
things
so
upon
others
suddenly
miss
van
buren
looked
up
from
a
red
book
which
had
engaged
her
attention
ever
since
at
alphen
we
turned
out
of
the
narrow
of
the
canal
into
the
broader
thoroughfare
of
the
river
this
book
explains
everything
except
what
you
want
to
know
she
complained
why
ca
it
tell
what
saint
joris
is
in
england
he
must
be
some
saint
there
and
i
saw
his
name
over
that
nice
little
inn
with
the
garden
at
alphen
george
i
said
though
she
had
not
asked
me
i
might
have
known
she
sighed
and
no
doubt
the
dutch
have
put
the
dragon
into
their
language
too
stuck
full
of
those
i
and
j
that
make
me
feel
whenever
i
see
them
in
print
as
if
my
hair
were
done
up
too
tight
or
my
teeth
were
sizes
too
large
for
my
mouth
wijn
for
instance
who
would
think
that
meant
something
sleek
and
pleasant
like
rhine
wine
why
not
i
asked
we
pronounce
it
almost
the
same
that
because
you
have
got
the
courage
of
your
convictions
you
fling
the
and
about
and
then
pretend
they
not
there
why
do
you
see
that
they
only
i
protested
and
really
it
does
appear
strange
that
to
foreign
eyes
they
can
look
when
side
by
side
like
separate
letters
but
the
chaperon
stopped
us
she
said
that
we
could
find
enough
to
do
minding
our
p
and
q
in
life
without
quarreling
over
i
and
j
so
the
argument
ended
and
the
girls
turned
their
attention
to
making
tea
they
did
it
charmingly
juggling
with
the
contents
of
a
which
starr
brought
on
deck
and
placed
on
a
little
whether
miss
van
buren
forgot
me
or
not
in
dealing
out
cups
when
tea
was
made
at
all
events
she
pretended
to
and
reminded
by
her
stepsister
gave
me
tea
without
sugar
then
begged
for
one
lump
she
absentmindedly
dropped
in
three
while
talking
with
starr
robert
would
certainly
have
been
tempted
to
shake
her
if
he
had
been
present
at
that
illustration
absentmindedly
dropped
in
three
while
talking
to
xii
my
mother
sent
me
to
oxford
because
she
thought
that
she
could
take
no
intelligent
interest
in
any
young
man
if
he
had
not
had
his
four
years
at
oxford
or
cambridge
but
afterwards
through
loyalty
to
my
fatherland
i
gave
myself
two
at
the
university
of
leiden
and
as
the
rooms
i
lived
in
there
hold
memories
of
oliver
goldsmith
i
kept
them
on
ever
since
i
was
when
i
said
to
leiden
and
for
the
five
the
rooms
have
been
lent
to
a
cousin
studying
for
his
degree
as
a
learned
doctor
of
law
now
i
knew
it
was
close
upon
the
time
for
him
to
take
his
degree
and
i
hoped
that
i
might
be
able
to
show
my
friends
and
one
enemy
a
few
things
in
my
old
university
town
which
ordinary
tourists
might
not
see
the
had
been
washed
up
and
a
discussion
of
plans
from
which
miss
van
buren
managed
to
exclude
me
had
ended
in
no
definite
conclusion
when
i
brought
lorelei
into
one
of
the
innumerable
green
canals
in
leiden
none
of
you
seem
to
know
what
you
want
to
do
first
last
or
in
the
middle
i
ventured
to
remark
so
to
save
time
perhaps
you
let
me
offer
a
few
suggestions
i
told
hendrik
to
fetch
a
cab
and
gone
when
your
carriage
comes
engage
rooms
at
the
levedag
hotel
drive
through
the
town
have
a
glance
at
the
churches
and
go
to
the
stadhuis
you
like
the
spire
and
the
façade
they
both
of
the
sixteenth
century
when
we
were
prosperous
and
artistic
and
over
the
entrance
there
a
chronogram
inscription
concerning
the
siege
i
go
because
i
want
to
arrange
your
evening
which
i
hope
will
be
a
success
but
i
meet
you
in
the
archive
room
at
the
stadhuis
where
you
can
admire
the
paneling
till
i
come
i
wo
keep
you
waiting
long
and
then
i
take
you
over
the
university
buildings
i
was
there
you
know
as
a
student
by
the
time
this
plan
was
arranged
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
except
that
of
the
person
i
wished
to
please
hendrik
had
arrived
with
a
cab
and
five
minutes
later
i
was
free
to
carry
out
my
scheme
for
the
evening
from
gouda
i
sent
a
wire
to
my
cousin
jan
van
hol
asking
him
to
be
at
home
and
expecting
me
between
four
and
five
so
i
felt
sure
of
him
i
took
all
the
short
cuts
which
i
know
as
well
as
i
know
my
hat
and
was
soon
climbing
the
stairs
of
the
old
house
the
top
floor
of
which
was
home
to
me
for
two
years
from
those
windows
goldsmith
looked
down
on
the
sleepy
canal
when
he
visited
a
crony
who
was
tenant
of
the
rooms
and
the
door
which
goldsmith
hand
often
touched
was
thrown
open
by
the
present
tenant
who
must
have
been
listening
for
my
step
to
my
surprise
he
was
in
wild
and
far
out
of
his
usual
phlegmatic
self
with
excitement
it
my
promotie
day
he
explained
i
just
back
and
have
got
out
of
my
after
the
final
exam
i
due
at
the
club
for
the
first
part
of
my
dinner
in
a
few
minutes
had
you
forgotten
or
did
you
get
your
card
i
told
him
that
no
doubt
it
was
at
liliendaal
or
wandering
in
search
of
me
and
when
i
had
slapped
him
on
the
back
and
congratulated
him
as
learned
doctor
i
began
to
wonder
what
i
should
do
as
it
was
clear
he
would
have
no
time
to
help
me
carry
out
my
plans
his
promotie
dinner
the
grandest
affair
of
student
life
and
the
rounding
off
of
it
would
be
in
three
parts
with
various
ceremonies
in
between
and
would
last
from
now
until
two
or
three
in
the
morning
however
i
told
him
what
i
had
wanted
to
give
a
surprise
dinner
at
his
diggings
for
the
party
from
lorelei
with
him
to
arrange
details
while
i
played
guide
and
to
take
the
part
of
host
for
us
at
eight
could
he
suggest
any
one
who
would
look
after
the
thing
in
his
place
van
rhonda
or
douw
for
instance
but
van
rhonda
and
douw
it
seemed
were
the
paranymphs
or
supporters
of
the
doctor
and
their
time
would
be
fully
taken
up
in
seeing
him
through
all
my
old
friends
who
were
left
would
be
at
the
promotie
dinner
but
jan
was
sure
that
my
business
might
be
safely
entrusted
to
the
landlady
she
would
get
flowers
go
to
the
hotel
to
order
whatever
i
wished
and
even
superintend
the
waiters
with
this
i
had
to
be
satisfied
for
in
the
midst
of
the
discussion
appeared
the
two
paranymphs
wanting
to
know
what
kept
jan
and
the
hero
of
the
day
was
ruthlessly
carried
off
between
them
i
had
to
do
the
best
i
could
my
old
landlady
had
not
forgotten
me
and
i
was
assured
that
i
might
depend
upon
her
when
i
had
scribbled
a
menu
consisting
of
some
rather
odd
dishes
sketched
an
idea
for
the
table
decoration
and
given
a
few
other
hasty
instructions
i
dashed
off
to
keep
my
appointment
at
the
stadhuis
on
the
way
i
consoled
myself
with
the
reflection
that
an
ill
wind
which
blows
nobody
good
i
had
been
bereaved
of
jan
as
a
prop
but
i
might
make
use
of
him
and
his
friends
as
one
of
the
sights
of
leiden
and
i
would
take
advantage
of
my
knowledge
of
the
usual
program
on
such
festive
nights
as
this
for
the
benefit
of
my
friends
i
arrived
at
the
stadhuis
as
the
others
took
their
first
look
at
the
oak
in
the
archive
room
there
was
just
one
other
room
in
this
most
excellent
and
historic
building
that
i
wanted
miss
van
buren
to
see
it
was
a
tapestry
room
among
other
tapestry
rooms
of
no
importance
but
i
remembered
her
fantastic
desire
to
live
in
the
country
and
i
recalled
a
certain
tapestry
garden
in
which
i
felt
sure
she
would
long
to
wander
there
was
a
meal
of
some
wonderful
sort
going
on
in
it
and
i
had
been
conscious
in
other
days
of
a
desire
to
be
a
tapestry
man
and
sit
with
the
merry
tapestry
lady
smiling
there
all
tapestry
people
look
incredibly
happy
for
in
tapestry
etiquette
it
bad
form
to
be
tragic
even
their
battles
are
comedy
battles
as
you
can
see
by
the
faces
of
the
that
they
have
a
strong
sense
of
humor
but
these
particular
tapestry
friends
of
mine
were
the
gayest
i
ever
met
and
i
wanted
miss
van
buren
to
make
their
acquaintance
to
reach
the
room
through
another
also
representing
a
tapestry
world
we
had
to
perform
a
dreadful
surgical
operation
on
the
abdomen
of
a
roman
emperor
by
opening
a
door
in
the
middle
of
it
and
as
the
mariner
said
the
size
of
the
next
room
gave
the
same
sort
of
shock
that
jonah
must
have
had
when
he
arrived
in
the
whale
if
i
had
shown
her
that
tapestry
garden
miss
van
buren
would
have
feigned
indifference
but
i
left
her
to
starr
and
from
a
distance
had
the
chastened
pleasure
of
hearing
her
say
to
him
the
things
i
should
have
liked
her
to
say
to
me
afterwards
i
swept
the
party
away
to
the
university
preparing
their
minds
to
expect
no
architectural
splendors
leiden
is
our
most
famous
university
i
said
but
we
have
no
streets
of
beautiful
old
colleges
no
lovely
gardens
you
see
oxford
and
cambridge
are
universities
round
which
towns
have
gathered
whereas
leiden
was
a
city
long
before
william
the
silent
gave
its
people
choice
as
a
reward
for
their
heroic
defense
of
freedom
from
taxes
or
a
university
when
they
said
they
have
the
university
the
thing
was
to
get
it
money
was
plentiful
and
here
was
an
old
monastery
empty
and
ready
for
use
a
building
whose
simplicity
would
have
appealed
to
william
in
his
later
days
it
was
not
until
they
had
this
apology
well
in
their
heads
that
i
ushered
them
into
the
bare
courtyard
so
full
of
memories
for
me
and
here
i
buckled
on
my
armor
of
defense
our
universities
have
produced
great
men
though
they
given
them
no
gothic
buildings
or
fairy
gardens
where
will
you
find
more
illustrious
names
than
scaliger
grotius
and
oliver
goldsmith
lots
of
others
too
why
niebuhr
said
of
our
old
hall
that
no
place
is
so
memorable
in
the
history
of
science
trying
to
appear
impressed
the
three
ladies
followed
by
starr
trailed
into
the
building
deserted
at
this
hour
and
it
was
the
artist
quick
eye
that
first
caught
the
eccentric
merit
of
the
famous
caricatures
lining
the
staircase
then
came
the
chamber
of
torture
the
sweating
room
that
bare
whitewashed
cell
remembered
by
all
leideners
with
anguish
there
i
and
thousands
before
and
thousands
after
had
sat
to
wait
my
dreaded
turn
with
the
professors
behind
the
table
in
the
room
next
door
there
i
among
those
other
ones
had
scribbled
my
name
and
scrawled
a
sketch
or
two
here
sweated
rudolph
brederode
read
out
miss
rivers
with
a
sweet
look
as
if
she
pitied
me
now
for
what
i
suffered
then
but
miss
van
buren
showed
sublime
indifference
she
wished
she
said
to
pick
out
names
that
were
really
interesting
even
she
however
was
roused
to
compassion
for
the
tortured
ones
when
in
the
adjoining
room
she
heard
that
the
examinations
were
conducted
publicly
and
that
there
was
no
reason
why
any
stranger
should
not
walk
in
from
the
street
to
hear
the
victims
put
to
the
question
it
good
for
us
i
said
helps
us
to
pluck
and
but
nobody
agreed
with
me
and
it
was
miss
van
buren
opinion
that
none
save
dutchmen
would
stand
it
the
senate
room
which
niebuhr
wrote
of
found
favor
in
her
eyes
but
after
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
in
the
university
and
it
was
only
six
there
were
two
hours
before
the
surprise
dinner
so
without
giving
my
secret
away
i
said
that
if
we
put
off
dining
until
eight
we
could
see
the
laeckenhalle
and
go
up
to
the
burg
at
sunset
the
laeckenhalle
and
the
burg
were
mere
names
to
them
as
few
scraps
are
thrown
to
either
place
by
the
but
so
delighted
were
they
with
the
carvings
on
the
house
of
the
cloth
spinner
guild
and
the
marbles
in
the
courtyard
that
i
could
hardly
get
them
inside
once
within
starr
made
miss
van
buren
laugh
at
the
things
she
ought
to
have
respected
and
linger
before
the
things
i
had
intended
to
point
out
but
i
was
not
shocked
at
her
flippant
delight
in
a
quaint
representation
of
tortures
in
hell
nor
was
i
stirred
by
her
scorn
of
the
stiff
with
van
der
werf
offering
his
arm
as
food
for
the
starving
people
rather
than
surrender
to
the
spaniards
in
spite
of
her
distaste
for
the
painting
however
she
would
not
hear
me
decry
van
der
werf
in
favor
of
an
obscure
engineer
lately
discovered
as
the
true
hero
of
the
siege
van
der
werf
should
not
be
snatched
from
her
by
a
man
she
chose
to
detest
so
she
argued
and
abused
my
treachery
during
the
whole
time
spent
among
the
relics
of
the
siege
she
glared
at
the
saucepan
retrieved
from
the
spanish
camp
as
if
she
would
have
thrown
it
at
my
head
she
thought
me
capable
of
denying
authenticity
to
the
blocks
of
wood
torn
from
the
dykes
when
a
worm
made
holland
tremble
as
philip
of
spain
could
never
do
nor
would
she
forgive
me
van
der
werf
though
i
did
my
best
with
the
tale
of
that
time
of
fear
when
men
women
and
children
worked
their
fingers
to
the
bone
in
restoring
what
the
worm
had
destroyed
and
keeping
the
sea
from
their
doors
i
never
yielded
her
a
point
all
the
way
up
to
the
burg
for
at
least
i
was
cheating
starr
of
her
but
in
the
fortress
on
the
ancient
mound
heaped
up
by
hengist
i
and
my
opinions
were
forgotten
she
wanted
to
be
let
alone
and
pretend
she
was
a
woman
of
leiden
looking
out
across
the
red
roofs
of
the
city
through
the
pitiless
red
of
the
sunset
for
the
fleet
of
rescuing
barges
nevertheless
she
did
deign
to
ask
how
if
the
way
had
been
opened
for
the
sea
to
flood
the
land
the
people
coaxed
it
to
go
back
again
and
she
looked
at
me
as
she
had
looked
at
starr
while
i
told
how
the
thing
had
been
done
how
the
water
that
floated
william
fleet
for
the
relief
of
the
town
was
but
two
feet
in
depth
how
only
a
gale
from
the
south
at
the
right
time
sent
the
waters
flowing
from
the
broken
dykes
above
schiedam
north
as
far
as
leiden
and
how
no
sooner
was
the
city
saved
than
the
wind
changed
calling
back
the
waters
from
the
walls
of
the
fortress
we
saw
the
sun
go
down
and
then
with
starr
in
the
ascendant
again
we
strolled
through
quiet
streets
crossing
bridges
over
canals
spread
with
soft
green
carpets
of
moss
but
we
were
not
going
to
the
hotel
and
without
a
word
about
dinner
i
asked
if
they
would
care
to
see
a
student
diggings
i
had
only
to
add
as
a
bribe
that
oliver
goldsmith
had
visited
there
and
carved
his
initials
in
a
heart
on
the
wainscotting
to
make
them
eager
to
climb
the
steep
stairs
which
led
to
my
surprise
it
began
by
my
opening
the
door
at
the
top
with
a
key
instead
of
knocking
this
set
them
to
wondering
but
i
laughed
evading
questions
and
lured
them
into
an
room
dim
with
twilight
according
to
instructions
no
lamp
or
candle
had
been
lighted
but
a
glance
showed
me
a
large
screen
wrapped
round
something
in
a
corner
and
i
knew
that
i
had
trusted
good
old
mevrow
hoogeboom
in
vain
now
i
struck
a
match
from
my
own
and
as
the
flame
flared
up
success
number
one
was
scored
it
was
the
dutch
of
brass
to
which
i
touched
the
match
that
called
out
the
first
note
of
admiration
from
the
strangers
and
as
i
woke
up
candle
after
candle
in
its
quaint
brass
stick
the
first
notes
rose
to
a
chorus
what
a
lovely
room
what
walls
what
dear
old
china
beasts
what
a
wonderful
fireplace
with
handles
to
hold
on
by
as
you
stood
and
warmed
yourself
what
chairs
what
chests
of
drawers
what
pewter
tankards
if
this
were
a
typical
room
of
a
leiden
undergraduate
the
leiden
undergraduates
were
lucky
men
i
had
to
explain
that
it
was
hardly
fair
to
call
it
typical
that
only
a
man
with
money
and
a
love
for
picking
up
old
things
would
have
quarters
like
these
still
the
lodgings
were
typical
of
leiden
when
the
ladies
had
exhausted
their
adjectives
they
grew
curious
concerning
their
host
i
told
them
that
the
man
was
absent
because
this
happened
to
be
the
night
of
his
promotie
dinner
but
that
i
was
free
to
do
the
honors
well
i
sick
with
envy
of
the
fellow
said
starr
and
i
for
one
dare
trust
myself
any
longer
especially
on
an
empty
stomach
among
his
pewters
and
blue
beasts
and
brasses
we
better
go
away
and
have
dinner
you
need
go
away
said
i
jerking
an
and
drawing
the
screen
aside
behind
it
was
what
i
had
hoped
would
be
there
a
table
laid
for
five
with
plenty
of
nice
glass
and
silver
and
banked
with
pink
and
white
roses
as
everybody
exclaimed
at
the
sight
an
inner
door
opened
and
two
waiters
from
the
levedag
who
had
been
biding
their
time
for
my
signal
appeared
in
answer
to
the
bell
it
black
magic
said
aunt
fay
i
believe
these
men
are
genii
and
you
got
the
lamp
in
your
pocket
how
i
i
had
left
tibe
at
the
hotel
he
would
have
loved
this
poor
darling
illustration
it
black
magic
said
aunt
dinner
is
served
sir
announced
one
of
the
genii
and
laughing
i
offered
the
chaperon
my
arm
but
it
be
for
us
objected
miss
rivers
it
for
no
one
else
said
i
how
can
we
eat
the
man
things
when
he
never
seen
us
and
never
seen
him
miss
van
buren
appealed
to
starr
but
it
was
i
who
answered
you
see
him
now
i
confessed
these
are
my
rooms
i
lend
them
to
my
cousin
but
i
kept
the
right
to
use
them
as
for
the
dinner
it
my
dinner
and
it
will
be
a
humiliation
to
me
if
you
refuse
to
eat
it
these
words
were
meant
for
her
and
i
looked
straight
at
her
as
i
spoke
so
there
could
be
no
mistake
red
sprang
to
her
cheeks
she
bit
her
lip
and
what
she
would
have
answered
or
done
if
left
to
herself
i
shall
never
know
for
miss
rivers
slipped
one
arm
coaxingly
within
the
arm
of
her
stepsister
and
said
with
a
laugh
to
make
it
seem
that
all
three
were
jesting
why
of
course
she
wo
refuse
none
of
us
would
forgive
her
for
spoiling
our
pleasure
come
along
nell
so
nell
did
come
along
like
the
sweet
and
sensible
girl
she
really
is
when
she
has
not
been
driven
to
defiance
by
blundering
young
men
and
we
sat
down
to
eat
the
best
dinner
that
leiden
could
provide
at
short
notice
nothing
that
was
truly
dutch
had
been
forgotten
but
the
most
brilliant
success
was
not
the
on
which
the
would
have
staked
his
reputation
it
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
dish
with
which
all
leiden
invariably
occupies
itself
on
the
of
october
anniversary
of
blessed
memory
on
that
day
it
was
three
hundred
and
thirty
odd
years
ago
that
a
little
boy
ran
joyously
home
from
a
flying
visit
to
the
deserted
spanish
camp
with
a
pot
of
carrots
and
potatoes
mixed
together
in
a
therefore
with
does
leiden
to
this
hour
celebrate
the
great
relief
eating
with
thanksgiving
and
my
guests
ate
with
compliments
enjoying
the
idea
if
not
the
food
as
if
they
had
been
leideners
last
of
all
we
had
grilled
herrings
with
mustard
on
toasted
bread
a
quaint
conceit
which
i
had
to
explain
by
telling
how
on
the
of
october
bread
and
herrings
are
still
distributed
to
the
poor
because
it
was
with
herrings
and
bread
that
the
dutch
boats
coming
to
the
relief
of
leiden
were
loaded
i
managed
to
keep
the
party
long
at
the
table
and
when
the
chaperon
proposed
going
i
looked
at
my
watch
counseling
patience
for
half
an
hour
if
you
wait
i
said
i
show
you
something
rather
special
on
the
way
home
something
that
ca
be
seen
by
every
one
then
i
told
about
my
cousin
how
this
was
his
great
day
and
how
without
being
invited
we
could
share
the
fun
i
told
how
early
this
morning
jan
paranymphs
had
donned
evening
dress
according
to
old
custom
and
driven
in
smart
carriages
the
horses
heads
nodding
with
plumes
to
the
railway
station
to
meet
their
principal
father
mother
sisters
and
pretty
cousins
how
the
party
had
then
come
to
these
rooms
where
jan
had
received
them
half
shamefaced
in
his
how
not
long
before
we
arrived
at
the
university
jan
had
gone
through
his
torture
in
the
and
before
the
examiners
with
his
relatives
present
how
the
ladies
after
seeing
the
town
had
been
ungallantly
packed
off
home
before
the
best
fun
began
how
jan
had
returned
to
cast
away
his
evening
things
at
the
time
when
most
people
think
of
putting
them
on
and
rush
to
the
students
club
in
morning
dress
how
his
paranymphs
and
friends
had
met
him
and
at
a
big
round
table
soon
to
be
covered
with
glasses
the
professors
servant
called
pedel
of
the
university
had
handed
the
new
doctor
his
official
appointment
in
return
for
a
fee
of
ten
gulden
how
the
dinner
had
begun
in
and
music
with
an
adjournment
after
the
first
part
to
the
garden
for
coffee
liqueurs
and
cigars
how
when
the
table
had
been
cleared
and
rearranged
everybody
had
marched
back
to
risk
their
lives
by
eating
lobster
and
quantities
of
indigestible
things
how
jan
would
then
have
had
to
make
his
palaver
thanking
his
friends
for
their
speeches
in
his
honor
and
how
while
he
was
speaking
the
waiters
would
be
placing
a
large
napkin
at
the
plate
of
each
man
a
mere
napkin
but
destined
for
an
outlandish
purpose
by
this
time
i
went
on
mysteriously
those
napkins
are
fulfilling
their
destiny
and
if
you
would
like
to
see
what
it
is
you
only
to
follow
me
they
were
on
their
feet
in
an
instant
we
scrambled
down
the
narrow
stairs
and
out
into
the
starlit
night
leiden
was
a
city
of
the
dead
not
even
a
dog
played
sentinel
for
the
sleeping
townsfolk
not
a
cat
sprang
out
of
the
shadows
as
i
led
my
band
through
a
labyrinth
of
floored
as
if
with
jet
nailed
down
with
stars
but
suddenly
the
spell
of
silence
was
broken
by
an
explosion
of
sound
which
crashed
into
it
like
breaking
glass
a
brassy
blare
of
music
that
could
not
drown
young
men
laughter
burst
on
us
so
unexpectedly
that
the
three
ladies
gave
starts
and
stifled
cries
i
stopped
them
at
a
corner
and
we
huddled
into
the
shadow
flattened
against
a
wall
the
napkins
are
coming
i
said
and
i
had
not
got
the
words
out
before
the
blue
darkness
was
aflame
with
the
red
light
of
streaming
torches
a
wild
light
which
matched
the
band
music
there
was
a
trampling
of
feet
and
in
the
midst
of
smoke
and
ruddy
flare
sequined
with
flying
sparks
came
and
musicians
led
by
one
man
of
solemn
countenance
holding
in
both
hands
a
noble
nougat
tart
the
historic
the
indispensable
nougat
tart
then
with
a
measured
trot
that
swung
and
balanced
with
the
music
followed
the
napkins
wound
round
the
heads
of
their
wearers
and
floating
like
white
banners
with
the
breeze
of
motion
first
came
a
paranymph
thus
adorned
then
the
learned
doctor
holding
fast
to
the
leader
behind
him
the
second
paranymph
and
clinging
to
his
coat
the
hero
father
with
the
whole
procession
of
turbaned
friends
tailing
after
they
swept
by
us
as
a
comet
sweeps
down
the
sky
and
concerned
themselves
with
our
group
against
the
wall
no
more
than
a
comet
does
with
such
humble
stars
dusting
the
outskirts
of
the
milky
way
as
shrink
from
his
fiery
path
a
vision
of
goblins
said
the
mariner
when
he
had
got
his
breath
what
fun
but
why
do
they
do
it
asked
miss
rivers
why
i
sure
i
do
know
i
laughed
except
because
they
always
have
and
i
suppose
always
will
while
there
a
university
at
leiden
that
all
we
see
but
it
is
all
there
is
to
see
the
procession
will
go
prancing
back
to
the
club
where
the
next
thing
will
be
to
get
over
the
big
then
over
the
buffet
of
the
bar
without
once
breaking
the
chain
of
through
passages
and
kitchens
to
the
once
more
where
the
chain
will
be
split
up
but
where
the
chairs
in
which
the
men
will
sit
to
drink
champagne
and
eat
the
nougat
tart
must
be
the
tables
and
not
round
them
and
will
that
be
the
end
inquired
the
chaperon
who
ever
thirsts
with
ardor
for
information
not
nearly
said
i
the
third
part
of
dinner
will
be
due
and
every
one
bound
to
eat
it
even
those
whose
chairs
have
fallen
off
from
the
pyramids
of
small
tables
and
whose
heads
or
bones
have
suffered
they
have
dessert
and
at
dawn
the
best
men
will
be
taking
a
country
drive
i
begin
to
understand
said
starr
how
your
people
exhausted
the
spaniards
good
heavens
you
could
wear
out
the
rock
of
gibraltar
and
i
see
why
though
you
can
eat
all
day
and
all
night
too
you
do
put
on
fat
like
your
german
cousins
when
we
begin
a
thing
we
dutchmen
see
it
through
i
replied
modestly
so
do
we
americans
remarked
miss
van
buren
i
wonder
which
would
win
if
the
two
interests
were
opposed
i
hazarded
à
propos
of
nothing
or
of
much
i
should
bet
on
america
said
she
i
bet
i
returned
with
all
the
emphasis
i
dared
give
though
perhaps
it
was
not
enough
to
tear
up
a
impression
albeit
the
seed
had
been
sown
for
but
hours
so
ended
the
lesson
for
the
first
day
it
was
not
an
easy
lesson
for
me
but
i
regret
nothing
xiii
look
here
said
the
mariner
next
morning
rapping
on
my
door
at
the
hotel
how
soon
could
we
start
for
katwyk
i
thought
the
expedition
was
given
up
i
answered
as
nobody
spoke
of
it
last
night
not
in
your
presence
but
my
worthy
aunt
rejoices
in
a
and
we
met
there
some
of
us
to
discuss
the
expedition
the
girls
they
keen
to
go
but
it
a
case
of
hypnotism
wants
a
thing
and
in
some
curious
way
known
only
to
herself
she
gives
others
the
impression
that
they
are
wanting
it
frantically
i
noticed
that
said
i
oh
you
have
well
she
a
wonderful
woman
i
dare
dwell
upon
the
things
she
got
out
of
me
already
or
ask
myself
what
she
get
before
the
play
finished
that
for
instance
i
suppose
it
will
end
in
her
always
having
one
did
you
observe
tibe
collar
it
cost
dollars
and
the
queer
part
is
that
i
it
to
her
i
thought
at
the
time
i
wanted
him
to
have
it
now
i
ask
you
as
man
to
man
is
it
and
she
has
a
with
gold
fittings
i
presented
it
under
the
delusion
that
i
owed
it
to
her
as
my
temporary
relative
heavens
where
is
this
to
end
not
at
katwyk
with
the
rhine
but
we
got
to
go
there
anything
to
please
her
strange
to
say
the
hypnotic
influence
must
have
stolen
up
from
her
ladyship
room
on
the
floor
below
and
along
the
corridor
to
mine
for
i
found
myself
thinking
she
rather
likes
me
and
can
be
useful
if
she
dominates
the
two
girls
in
this
way
i
must
do
my
best
to
keep
her
on
my
side
no
doubt
this
was
the
form
the
influence
took
but
i
made
no
struggle
against
it
on
the
contrary
i
assured
starr
that
the
expedition
to
katwyk
would
be
a
good
expedition
that
i
would
be
dressed
in
ten
minutes
that
i
did
mind
about
breakfast
but
would
have
a
cup
of
coffee
with
hendrik
that
if
the
party
came
on
board
lorelei
in
half
an
hour
they
would
find
her
ready
all
right
i
tell
them
said
he
i
did
want
to
stop
and
see
a
few
pictures
for
it
seems
a
burning
shame
to
leave
the
town
where
gerard
douw
and
steen
and
lots
of
other
splendid
chaps
were
born
without
worshiping
at
their
shrines
but
they
rather
bare
shrines
at
leiden
i
consoled
him
you
seen
much
better
specimens
of
their
work
elsewhere
you
be
disappointed
just
as
well
to
think
so
i
give
your
message
but
as
there
are
three
ladies
and
one
dog
you
better
expect
us
when
you
see
us
in
spite
of
this
fact
i
had
little
time
to
spare
though
it
appeared
that
to
the
boat
a
delay
was
caused
by
tibe
jumping
into
a
cab
with
two
elderly
ladies
from
boston
who
so
far
from
reciprocating
his
overtures
nearly
swooned
with
terror
and
had
to
be
soothed
and
sustained
by
the
entire
party
the
canal
that
leads
from
leiden
to
passes
the
houses
of
descartes
and
spinoza
and
altogether
the
short
journey
by
water
did
not
lack
interest
for
katwyk
has
become
a
colony
of
artists
once
there
we
walked
to
the
sluice
where
the
rhine
seeks
its
grave
in
the
north
sea
and
as
it
happened
that
the
tide
was
high
with
a
strong
shore
wind
i
could
show
the
cyclopean
defenses
of
our
coast
at
their
best
with
the
secret
pleasure
which
i
believe
all
men
take
in
pointing
out
things
to
women
i
explained
the
great
series
of
gates
through
which
the
river
passes
to
its
death
all
were
closed
against
the
raging
waves
which
leaped
and
bellowed
demanding
entrance
rearing
their
fierce
heads
twelve
feet
or
more
above
the
level
where
the
rhine
lay
dying
when
the
tide
should
turn
and
the
wild
water
retreat
the
would
be
opened
and
the
river
would
pour
sweeping
away
the
masses
of
sand
piled
up
in
fury
by
the
cheated
waves
we
lunched
on
board
the
lorelei
i
munching
abjectly
on
deck
on
duty
at
the
wheel
while
from
the
cabin
below
came
to
my
ears
the
tinkling
of
girls
laughter
and
the
merry
popping
of
corks
in
theory
i
was
better
off
than
tantalus
for
tantalus
had
no
beer
or
sandwiches
but
on
the
other
hand
tantalus
was
not
in
love
with
a
girl
whose
voice
he
could
hear
mingling
with
his
rival
so
practically
there
was
not
much
to
choose
luckily
i
had
not
to
bear
the
strain
for
long
i
did
my
best
yesterday
in
talking
of
haarlem
to
awaken
interest
in
the
huge
polder
and
its
importance
in
the
modern
scheme
of
the
netherlands
now
my
eloquence
was
rewarded
for
they
hurried
through
their
luncheon
not
that
they
might
cheer
the
skipper
loneliness
but
that
they
might
miss
no
feature
in
the
landscape
we
were
skirting
one
side
of
the
green
plain
which
has
been
reclaimed
from
the
water
converting
the
meer
into
a
polder
our
canal
flowed
many
feet
above
the
level
of
the
surrounding
land
so
that
we
looked
down
upon
men
tilling
upon
boats
cutting
through
miniature
waterways
as
if
they
navigated
meadows
and
upon
cows
grazing
in
mist
which
rose
like
blowing
silver
spray
over
the
waves
of
grass
these
cattle
according
to
miss
van
buren
form
the
upper
circles
of
the
in
holland
not
only
do
they
live
up
to
their
traditions
by
being
cleaner
and
sleeker
than
the
cows
of
other
countries
but
they
know
themselves
to
be
better
connected
than
the
mere
creatures
with
whom
they
are
occasionally
forced
to
share
a
meadow
to
show
that
they
understand
what
is
due
to
their
dignity
they
refuse
to
talk
with
the
common
herd
and
stand
with
their
backs
to
any
nonentity
that
may
presume
to
graze
near
conversing
among
themselves
in
refined
monotones
with
the
air
of
saying
who
she
there
little
in
the
history
of
the
netherlands
which
miss
van
buren
does
not
know
for
she
is
proud
of
her
dutch
blood
though
she
wo
say
so
before
me
the
others
are
frankly
ignorant
but
the
chaperon
has
read
a
book
of
rider
haggard
called
lysbeth
and
was
deeply
interested
in
the
where
the
treasure
of
that
story
lay
hid
but
it
was
news
to
her
that
the
great
inland
sea
had
once
sent
a
destructive
flood
to
the
gates
of
amsterdam
and
that
as
punishment
it
had
been
drained
away
miss
van
buren
whom
i
think
of
as
nell
knew
all
this
including
the
very
day
in
when
the
work
was
begun
and
how
many
months
the
pumps
had
taken
to
drink
the
monstrous
cup
dry
but
the
mysterious
little
lady
who
rules
us
all
and
is
ruled
by
tibe
expected
to
find
the
still
a
lake
and
was
disappointed
to
learn
the
meaning
of
polder
she
thought
months
too
long
for
draining
it
and
was
sure
that
in
america
where
she
quickly
added
that
she
had
once
been
they
would
have
done
the
work
in
half
the
time
every
one
fell
in
love
with
the
outskirts
of
haarlem
as
lorelei
swam
into
the
river
spaarne
though
the
glory
of
the
tulips
was
extinguished
like
at
dawn
three
months
ago
the
flowers
of
summer
blazed
in
their
stead
a
brilliant
mosaic
of
jewels
the
dutch
do
seem
a
nation
to
have
gone
mad
over
a
tulip
but
perhaps
they
were
different
in
the
seventeenth
century
said
miss
rivers
looking
at
me
as
if
i
stood
to
represent
my
people
and
the
english
do
seem
the
kind
to
have
lost
their
heads
over
a
south
sea
bubble
but
they
did
retorted
nell
as
if
she
were
defending
us
they
liked
the
houses
along
the
houses
big
and
little
which
look
as
if
the
front
and
back
walls
of
their
lower
stories
had
been
knocked
out
and
the
space
filled
in
with
glass
they
were
amused
by
the
rounded
awnings
over
the
balconies
which
nell
likened
to
the
covers
of
giant
babies
perambulators
and
they
laughed
at
the
doors
picked
out
with
lines
of
pale
green
which
contrasted
with
a
whitewashed
façade
at
haarlem
i
had
another
surprise
for
them
which
i
arranged
before
leaving
rotterdam
it
was
one
which
would
cost
nothing
in
trouble
little
enough
in
money
and
would
give
pleasure
to
everybody
except
to
my
chauffeur
who
is
in
love
with
my
mother
french
maid
and
no
doubt
was
reveling
in
the
thought
of
a
long
holiday
at
liliendaal
when
i
brought
lorelei
through
the
bridge
and
hove
her
to
by
the
broad
quay
there
stood
close
at
hand
a
handsome
what
a
beauty
exclaimed
nell
that
much
grander
than
robert
then
she
glanced
at
me
i
beg
your
pardon
said
she
demurely
afraid
the
car
my
cousin
has
is
yours
so
is
this
said
i
dear
me
what
is
it
doing
here
she
demanded
sorry
to
have
praised
a
possession
of
the
enemy
it
waiting
to
take
you
round
haarlem
i
replied
i
thought
it
would
be
a
nice
way
for
you
to
see
the
place
as
the
suburbs
are
its
speciality
so
to
speak
and
motoring
saves
time
you
a
queer
chap
alb
remarked
the
mariner
you
have
such
a
way
of
keeping
things
up
your
sleeve
and
springing
them
on
one
you
ought
to
be
called
the
silent
why
that
what
he
is
called
did
you
know
van
buren
told
us
exclaimed
phyllis
and
ended
up
her
sentence
with
a
stifled
shriek
which
could
have
meant
nothing
but
a
surreptitious
pinch
i
would
not
have
glanced
at
either
of
the
girls
for
anything
but
i
would
have
given
something
to
know
how
nell
was
looking
have
you
any
more
belongings
here
asked
the
chaperon
gaily
such
as
an
ancestral
castle
where
you
could
give
us
another
surprise
feast
i
laughed
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
an
ancestral
castle
in
the
neighborhood
it
is
mine
but
it
was
my
ancestors
and
if
i
exactly
entertain
you
in
it
i
can
give
you
tea
close
by
at
a
country
inn
perhaps
you
read
about
the
château
of
brederode
within
a
drive
of
haarlem
i
saw
by
nell
face
that
she
had
but
she
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
answer
and
the
others
had
informed
themselves
of
its
existence
hendrik
helped
by
my
chauffeur
got
out
the
small
luggage
which
is
kept
ready
for
shore
duty
the
chaperon
making
everything
else
look
shabby
and
the
five
of
us
six
with
tibe
got
into
the
car
i
taking
the
driver
seat
the
streets
of
haarlem
being
too
good
to
slight
i
drove
leisurely
toward
the
heart
of
the
old
town
meaning
to
engage
rooms
and
leave
all
belongings
at
the
quaint
hotel
funckler
which
i
thought
they
would
like
better
than
any
other
but
passing
the
cathedral
miss
phyllis
begged
to
stop
and
i
slowed
down
the
car
after
gouda
wonderful
glass
they
would
have
found
the
haarlem
church
disappointing
had
it
not
been
for
the
two
or
three
redeeming
features
left
in
the
cold
bare
structure
the
beautiful
screen
of
open
with
its
base
of
dark
wood
on
which
mystic
beasts
disport
themselves
among
the
of
divers
ancient
towns
and
the
carved
nell
and
the
mariner
were
so
fascinated
by
a
wooden
gentleman
wearing
his
head
upside
down
and
a
curiously
mixed
animal
carrying
its
offspring
in
a
cloak
that
i
found
time
to
send
secretly
for
the
organist
and
before
my
friends
knew
what
was
happening
the
cold
white
cathedral
was
warmed
and
lighted
too
by
such
thrilling
music
as
few
organs
and
few
organists
can
make
when
it
was
over
and
only
fleeting
echoes
left
miss
rivers
came
and
thanked
me
that
was
your
thought
of
course
said
she
none
of
us
will
ever
forget
my
chauffeur
had
kept
tibe
and
when
we
reappeared
was
surprised
in
the
act
of
fitting
a
pair
of
spare
goggles
on
to
the
dog
aunt
fay
was
delighted
with
the
effect
and
a
photograph
was
taken
before
we
were
allowed
to
start
though
time
was
beginning
to
be
an
object
but
as
the
chaperon
cheerfully
remarked
tibe
and
tide
wait
for
no
man
what
does
oppruiming
mean
written
up
everywhere
in
the
shops
she
inquired
eagerly
as
the
car
flashed
through
street
after
street
i
told
her
that
in
a
dutch
town
it
was
equivalent
to
the
summer
sales
in
london
and
she
seemed
satisfied
though
i
doubt
if
she
knows
more
of
london
than
of
rotterdam
but
she
and
the
girls
wanted
everything
that
they
saw
in
the
show
windows
and
i
found
that
before
we
left
haarlem
the
mariner
purse
would
again
be
opened
wide
by
the
hypnotic
spell
of
aunt
fay
in
a
thirty
car
we
were
not
long
on
the
way
out
to
brederode
though
i
took
her
slowly
through
the
charming
bloemendaal
district
giving
the
strangers
plenty
of
time
to
admire
the
quaintly
built
country
houses
half
drowned
in
the
splendid
forest
where
druids
worshiped
once
and
to
find
out
for
themselves
that
the
dark
yellow
billows
in
the
background
were
dunes
hiding
the
sea
we
left
the
car
in
front
of
the
shady
inn
and
ordered
coffee
to
be
ready
when
we
should
come
back
coffee
with
plenty
of
cream
and
a
kind
of
sugared
cake
which
has
been
loved
by
haarlemers
since
the
days
when
the
poor
deluded
ladies
of
the
town
baked
their
best
dainties
for
the
spaniards
who
planned
their
murder
it
was
natural
to
play
guide
on
the
way
to
the
dear
old
copper
and
purple
and
ruin
from
the
tower
roofs
to
the
mossy
moat
this
was
my
first
visit
to
the
place
for
a
year
or
two
and
i
longed
to
take
the
one
girl
apart
to
tell
her
of
my
fantastic
ancestor
the
water
beggar
of
whom
i
am
proud
despite
his
faults
and
eccentricities
to
recall
stories
of
the
past
the
origin
of
our
name
brede
rode
broad
rood
how
it
and
the
lands
were
given
as
a
reward
and
many
other
things
but
instead
i
made
myself
agreeable
to
the
chaperon
and
saved
tibe
on
three
separate
occasions
from
joining
the
bright
reflections
and
the
in
the
pond
i
sat
by
nell
at
a
table
afterwards
however
and
she
had
to
pour
coffee
for
me
because
she
was
doing
that
kind
office
for
the
rest
and
as
the
sugar
tongs
had
been
forgotten
she
popped
me
in
a
lump
of
sugar
with
her
own
fingers
before
she
stopped
to
think
then
she
looked
as
if
she
would
have
liked
to
fish
it
out
again
but
being
softer
than
her
heart
it
had
melted
and
i
got
it
in
spite
of
her
we
drove
back
through
the
forest
in
a
green
translucent
glimmer
like
light
under
the
sea
and
there
was
little
time
to
dress
for
dinner
when
i
brought
them
to
anchor
for
the
night
the
nice
old
hotel
with
its
delft
plates
half
covering
the
walls
its
alcoves
and
unexpected
stairways
with
green
balusters
and
its
old
looking
on
a
prim
garden
pleased
the
eyes
which
find
all
things
in
hollow
land
interesting
it
was
a
long
dinner
with
many
courses
such
as
dutchmen
love
still
when
we
finished
daylight
lingered
in
the
fantastic
square
with
its
crowding
varieties
of
capricious
dutch
architecture
the
cathedral
was
cut
black
and
sharp
out
of
a
sky
of
beaten
gold
and
coster
statue
wore
a
glittering
halo
under
their
archways
of
green
the
canals
were
on
fire
with
sunset
their
flames
quenched
in
the
thick
moss
which
clothed
their
walls
the
color
of
paved
streets
and
the
houses
with
their
pointed
façades
in
many
steps
burned
also
as
if
they
were
made
of
porphyry
instead
of
common
bricks
while
each
pane
of
each
window
blazed
like
a
separate
gem
it
was
a
good
ending
to
a
good
day
and
though
i
had
accomplished
nothing
definite
i
was
happy
next
morning
i
had
the
car
ready
early
and
took
every
one
for
a
spin
through
the
hout
which
reminded
them
of
the
bois
or
what
the
bois
would
be
if
pretty
houses
were
scattered
over
it
like
fallen
leaves
we
stopped
in
haarlem
after
that
last
spin
only
long
enough
to
do
reverence
to
franz
hals
and
the
collection
of
his
work
which
is
the
immediate
jewel
of
the
city
soul
illustration
stopped
at
haarlem
only
long
enough
to
do
reverence
to
franz
it
was
pretty
to
watch
nell
scraping
acquaintance
with
the
bold
officers
and
archers
and
bland
municipal
magnates
whom
hals
has
made
to
live
on
canvas
she
looked
the
big
stalwart
fellows
in
the
eye
but
half
shyly
as
a
girl
regards
a
man
to
whom
she
thinks
yet
is
not
quite
sure
she
ought
to
bow
why
their
faces
are
familiar
i
seem
to
have
known
them
i
heard
her
murmur
and
ventured
an
explanation
of
the
mystery
over
her
shoulder
you
do
know
them
i
said
their
eyes
are
using
the
eyes
of
their
descendants
for
windows
every
day
in
the
streets
holland
is
making
new
types
she
turned
to
look
me
up
and
down
with
a
flicker
of
long
lashes
then
she
sighed
what
a
pity
perhaps
i
deserved
it
for
i
had
brought
it
on
myself
nevertheless
sweet
phyllis
pitied
me
what
surprise
have
you
got
for
us
next
sir
skipper
she
asked
brightly
starr
says
that
no
day
will
be
complete
without
a
surprise
from
you
and
we
depend
upon
you
for
our
route
as
part
of
the
surprise
i
thought
starr
was
making
out
our
route
remarked
nell
to
a
tall
archer
of
franz
hals
if
i
contrived
to
create
that
impression
i
been
clever
said
the
mariner
in
fact
i
would
have
preferred
you
to
think
me
responsible
as
long
as
the
route
proved
satisfactory
of
course
whenever
anything
went
wrong
i
should
have
casually
let
drop
that
it
was
alb
idea
but
as
you
mention
the
subject
in
his
presence
i
must
admit
that
he
has
made
several
suggestions
and
i
humored
him
by
adopting
them
subject
to
your
approval
does
the
name
of
aalsmeer
convey
anything
to
your
minds
i
asked
but
all
shook
their
heads
except
nell
who
appeared
absorbed
in
making
a
of
her
hand
through
which
to
gaze
at
her
jolly
archer
then
it
shall
be
this
day
surprise
i
said
i
wo
tell
you
anything
but
you
need
be
ashamed
of
ignorance
for
all
the
world
is
in
the
same
boat
and
you
wo
find
aalsmeer
in
yet
there
is
a
place
in
the
netherlands
prettier
or
more
dutch
franz
hals
perhaps
forever
we
leave
you
to
seek
pastures
new
said
starr
come
along
miss
van
buren
so
she
came
and
i
drove
them
in
the
car
to
the
quay
where
i
directed
my
chauffeur
to
go
on
to
amsterdam
and
be
ready
to
report
for
order
at
the
harbor
of
the
sailing
and
rowing
club
xiv
there
is
nothing
remarkable
in
the
broad
canal
that
connects
haarlem
with
amsterdam
and
when
we
had
started
miss
van
buren
read
aloud
to
the
assembled
party
her
book
was
motley
and
the
subject
that
siege
which
though
it
ended
in
tragic
failure
makes
as
fine
music
in
history
as
the
siege
of
leiden
meanwhile
as
she
read
we
skimmed
through
the
bright
water
which
tinkled
like
shattered
crystals
as
we
broke
its
clear
mirror
with
our
prow
there
were
few
houses
along
shore
but
far
in
the
distance
seen
across
wide
flat
expanses
shadow
villages
and
tapering
spires
were
painted
in
violet
on
the
horizon
such
a
shimmering
horizon
as
we
of
the
lowlands
love
and
yearn
for
when
we
sojourn
in
mountain
lands
at
halfweg
a
little
cluster
of
humble
dwellings
i
turned
out
of
the
main
canal
skirting
the
side
of
the
polder
opposite
to
that
which
we
had
followed
yesterday
when
is
the
surprise
coming
asked
phyllis
at
last
her
curiosity
piqued
by
the
slowness
of
progress
in
this
small
canal
now
said
i
smiling
as
i
stopped
at
an
insignificant
this
is
where
we
go
on
shore
to
find
it
methinks
alb
you
are
playing
us
false
said
the
mariner
about
to
lead
us
into
a
trap
of
dulness
i
a
mind
to
stop
on
board
and
finish
the
chapter
said
nell
you
repent
it
if
you
do
i
ventured
yet
i
think
she
would
have
stayed
if
her
stepsister
had
not
urged
we
walked
along
an
ordinary
village
street
for
some
distance
it
was
dusty
and
unbeautiful
even
miss
rivers
had
begun
to
look
doubtful
when
suddenly
we
came
in
sight
of
a
toy
fairyland
a
dutch
fairyland
yet
a
place
to
excite
the
wonder
even
of
a
dutchman
used
to
living
half
in
half
out
of
water
from
where
the
party
stopped
arrested
by
the
curious
vision
stretched
away
as
far
as
eyes
could
follow
an
earthern
dyke
bordered
on
either
hand
by
a
toy
canal
just
wide
enough
for
a
toy
rowboat
to
pass
beyond
the
twin
toy
canals
again
on
either
hand
was
set
a
row
of
toy
houses
each
standing
in
a
little
square
of
radiant
garden
which
was
repeated
upside
down
in
the
water
not
only
of
the
twin
canals
but
of
the
still
more
tiny
subsidiary
canals
which
flowed
round
the
flowery
squares
cutting
each
off
from
its
fellow
tibe
delighted
with
aalsmeer
and
a
dog
he
saw
in
the
distance
darted
along
the
straight
level
stretch
of
dyke
which
every
now
and
then
heaved
itself
up
into
a
bridge
under
which
toy
boats
could
pass
from
the
to
the
we
followed
but
on
the
first
bridge
nell
stopped
impulsively
do
you
know
we
been
in
this
place
before
you
recognize
it
of
course
the
mariner
assured
her
you
and
i
used
to
play
here
together
when
we
were
children
you
remember
that
blue
boat
of
ours
and
see
there
our
house
the
pink
one
with
the
shutters
and
the
thicket
of
hydrangeas
reflected
in
the
water
is
it
good
to
come
back
to
our
own
thus
he
snatched
her
from
me
just
as
my
surprise
was
succeeding
and
made
a
place
for
himself
with
her
in
my
toy
fairyland
it
true
one
does
feel
like
one
of
the
little
blue
people
that
live
in
a
plate
said
phyllis
as
nell
and
starr
sauntered
on
ahead
it
perfectly
chinese
here
but
so
cozy
i
believe
you
had
the
place
made
a
few
minutes
ago
to
please
us
and
as
soon
as
we
turn
our
backs
it
will
disappear
it
be
real
those
men
think
it
real
said
i
there
were
several
rowing
along
the
canals
in
brightly
painted
boats
with
brass
milk
cans
and
apparatus
calmly
unaware
that
they
or
their
surroundings
were
out
of
the
common
each
house
on
its
square
island
having
its
own
of
planks
the
men
on
the
water
had
to
push
each
bridge
out
of
the
way
as
they
reached
it
but
the
trick
was
done
with
the
nose
of
the
boat
and
cost
no
trouble
most
of
the
toy
bridges
swung
back
into
place
when
the
boats
passed
but
the
one
nearest
us
remained
open
and
as
we
looked
walking
on
slowly
two
tiny
children
returning
from
school
clattered
toward
us
in
wooden
sabots
along
the
narrow
dyke
opposite
the
disarranged
bridge
they
stopped
looking
wistfully
across
at
a
house
standing
in
a
grove
of
roses
shaded
with
ruddy
copper
beeches
and
delicate
white
trees
like
young
girls
trooping
to
their
first
communion
evidently
this
was
the
children
home
but
they
found
themselves
shut
off
from
it
and
standing
with
their
tossed
over
their
shoulders
they
uttered
a
short
wailing
cry
as
if
in
answer
to
an
accustomed
signal
a
girl
who
of
course
had
been
cleaning
something
came
to
the
rescue
mop
in
hand
she
touched
the
bridge
with
her
foot
the
bridge
swung
into
place
without
a
word
the
dolls
crossed
and
were
swallowed
up
in
a
narrow
corridor
we
wandered
on
turning
our
heads
from
one
side
to
the
other
i
reveling
in
the
delight
of
the
others
though
aalsmeer
is
but
a
stone
throw
from
amsterdam
it
seems
as
far
out
of
the
world
as
if
to
get
to
it
you
had
jumped
off
the
earth
into
some
obscurely
twinkling
star
where
people
things
and
customs
were
completely
different
from
those
on
our
planet
if
there
had
been
only
one
of
the
queer
to
see
it
would
have
been
worth
a
journey
but
each
one
we
came
to
in
its
double
street
of
glass
seemed
more
quaint
than
that
we
left
behind
some
were
painted
green
or
blue
with
white
rosettes
like
the
sugar
ornaments
on
children
birthday
cakes
some
were
so
curtained
with
roses
wistaria
or
purple
clematis
that
it
was
difficult
to
spy
out
the
color
underneath
some
were
half
hidden
behind
tall
hedges
of
double
hollyhocks
like
crisp
bunches
of
pink
and
golden
crêpe
others
had
triumphal
arches
of
crimson
fuchsias
but
best
of
all
the
island
shows
were
the
dwarf
cut
in
every
imaginable
shape
there
were
thrones
and
chairs
and
giant
vases
harps
and
violins
and
a
menagerie
of
animals
which
seemed
to
have
come
under
a
spell
and
been
turned
into
leafage
in
the
act
of
jumping
flying
and
hopping
there
were
lions
swans
dragons
giraffes
parrots
eagles
cats
together
in
a
happy
family
of
foliage
and
when
i
told
the
chaperon
that
the
people
of
aalsmeer
were
as
well
as
she
insisted
on
stopping
nothing
would
satisfy
her
but
the
mariner
must
cross
the
bridge
knock
at
the
door
of
a
little
red
house
and
buy
a
baby
elephant
which
she
thought
would
be
enchanting
in
a
pot
as
a
kind
of
figurehead
on
board
waterspin
nor
was
i
allowed
to
remain
idle
when
i
had
helped
him
bargain
for
the
leafy
beast
i
had
to
go
down
on
my
knees
roll
up
my
sleeves
and
claw
out
from
the
canal
which
they
fringed
in
luscious
clusters
this
i
did
while
men
and
maids
in
painted
boats
heaped
with
rubies
piled
on
emeralds
which
were
strawberries
in
beds
of
their
own
leaves
laughed
at
me
boat
peddlers
came
and
went
too
with
stores
of
shining
tin
or
blue
brown
and
green
pottery
that
glittered
in
the
afternoon
sun
some
of
them
helped
me
some
jeered
in
dutch
at
these
foreigners
with
their
childish
ways
in
the
end
i
was
luckier
than
starr
for
he
had
to
march
under
the
weight
of
his
green
elephant
half
hidden
behind
it
as
behind
a
screen
while
my
lilies
were
so
popular
with
the
ladies
that
not
even
as
a
favor
would
i
have
been
allowed
to
carry
one
all
three
if
left
to
themselves
would
have
lingered
for
hours
choosing
which
house
they
would
live
in
or
watching
families
of
ducks
or
counting
strewn
flowers
floating
down
the
blue
water
as
stars
float
down
the
sky
i
believe
nephew
that
i
must
ask
you
to
buy
me
a
house
in
aalsmeer
to
come
and
play
dolls
in
announced
aunt
fay
do
you
suppose
jonkheer
that
one
could
be
got
cheap
not
that
need
be
a
consideration
to
dear
ronny
i
find
out
later
i
assured
her
answering
a
despairing
look
of
starr
from
between
the
green
tusks
of
his
elephant
oh
please
urged
the
gentle
voice
which
every
one
but
tibe
obeys
because
you
know
i
not
strong
and
when
i
set
my
heart
on
a
thing
and
suffer
disappointment
it
makes
me
ill
if
i
were
ill
i
should
have
to
go
home
and
those
darling
girls
could
finish
the
trip
you
have
had
time
to
set
your
heart
upon
a
house
here
said
starr
you
only
thought
of
it
a
minute
ago
we
scotch
have
so
heart
dearest
that
it
goes
out
to
things
and
people
in
less
than
a
minute
i
a
victim
to
mine
it
would
be
a
pity
oh
do
go
to
the
head
fairy
at
once
alb
and
demand
a
cheap
house
for
my
aunt
to
play
dolls
in
groaned
starr
if
he
has
got
one
he
must
build
it
he
could
easily
do
that
said
i
every
now
and
then
a
new
island
is
formed
in
this
and
the
nearest
householder
seizes
it
claiming
it
as
his
own
on
much
the
same
basis
that
napoleon
claimed
the
netherlands
then
he
digs
it
into
an
extra
garden
or
strawberry
bed
but
he
would
sacrifice
his
vegetables
if
he
saw
a
prospect
of
making
money
it
might
amuse
lady
macnairne
to
do
a
little
amateur
market
gardening
though
they
say
slugs
are
unusually
fat
and
juicy
in
aalsmeer
oh
maybe
i
better
wait
and
see
a
few
more
places
before
i
decide
then
exclaimed
the
lady
not
that
i
afraid
of
slugs
myself
only
i
sure
they
would
agree
with
tibe
and
besides
it
would
be
dull
for
him
in
winter
not
at
all
said
i
having
discovered
that
the
one
possible
way
of
detaching
the
lady
from
a
pet
scheme
is
by
advising
her
to
cling
to
it
everybody
skates
then
instead
of
going
about
in
boats
and
no
one
has
really
seen
aalsmeer
who
has
seen
it
on
a
winter
evening
then
in
front
of
each
island
on
a
low
square
post
is
set
a
lighted
lantern
imagine
the
effect
of
a
double
line
of
such
lights
all
the
way
down
the
long
long
canal
each
calling
up
a
from
under
the
blue
ice
the
tyrant
shivered
it
sounds
lovely
she
said
but
i
think
i
wait
come
girls
we
better
be
getting
back
to
the
boat
sweet
are
the
uses
of
an
albatross
i
heard
starr
murmur
we
turned
our
backs
on
the
water
fairies
domain
and
went
into
the
world
again
in
the
long
commonplace
street
of
shops
through
which
we
had
passed
in
coming
aunt
fay
stopped
she
had
torn
a
silk
flounce
on
her
petticoat
and
would
thank
me
to
act
as
interpreter
in
buying
a
box
of
i
made
the
demand
and
could
not
see
why
the
two
girls
and
their
chaperon
had
to
stifle
laughter
when
an
earnest
maiden
began
industriously
to
count
the
pins
in
the
box
she
says
she
has
to
do
that
because
they
are
sold
by
the
piece
i
explained
but
they
laughed
a
great
deal
more
it
was
a
pity
they
could
not
see
the
meer
which
rings
in
their
fairyland
a
meer
dotted
with
prim
little
islands
which
though
made
by
nature
not
man
have
much
the
same
effect
on
a
larger
scale
as
the
clipped
on
show
in
the
gardens
but
to
have
taken
lorelei
that
way
would
have
made
it
too
late
for
a
visit
to
zaandam
and
i
thought
zaandam
despite
its
miles
of
windmills
and
the
boasted
hut
of
peter
the
great
not
worth
a
separate
expedition
so
i
turned
back
to
halfweg
and
from
there
slid
into
a
side
canal
which
bore
us
toward
that
immense
waterway
cut
for
great
ships
the
north
sea
canal
there
was
a
smell
of
salt
in
the
air
and
a
heavy
perfume
from
gulls
wheeled
over
lorelei
so
low
that
we
could
have
reached
up
and
caught
their
dangling
coral
feet
a
passing
cloud
veiled
the
sun
with
gray
tissue
which
streaked
the
water
with
purple
shadow
and
freckled
it
with
rain
passengers
on
ships
that
loomed
above
us
like
leviathans
stared
down
at
our
little
craft
and
the
barge
we
towed
here
we
were
in
the
full
stream
of
traffic
and
commerce
and
afar
off
a
mass
of
towers
showed
where
amsterdam
toiled
and
made
merry
but
we
were
not
yet
bound
for
amsterdam
twisting
northward
as
the
details
of
the
city
were
sketched
upon
the
sky
we
turned
into
the
canal
which
leads
to
zaandam
of
the
painted
houses
there
was
just
time
for
a
swift
run
down
the
river
and
a
call
at
one
of
that
famous
battalion
of
windmills
whose
whirling
sails
fill
the
air
with
a
ceaseless
whirr
like
the
flight
of
birds
at
sunset
then
a
walk
to
the
hovel
where
peter
the
great
lived
and
learned
to
be
a
shipwright
but
when
they
had
seen
it
the
ladies
would
not
allow
it
to
be
called
by
so
mean
a
name
what
a
shame
they
found
out
who
he
was
so
soon
said
nell
and
he
had
to
leave
this
dear
little
bandbox
to
go
back
to
a
mere
palace
would
have
been
driven
away
by
a
curious
crowd
i
should
just
have
marched
through
with
my
nose
in
the
air
his
nose
was
of
that
kind
said
i
i
suppose
he
the
earliest
martyr
to
notoriety
on
record
but
perhaps
he
had
learned
all
he
wanted
to
know
and
i
not
sure
he
was
sorry
to
go
back
to
his
palace
which
judging
by
all
accounts
was
a
grand
one
in
those
days
you
see
finer
houses
even
in
amsterdam
and
an
hour
later
she
was
seeing
them
xv
amsterdam
was
in
full
glory
that
evening
in
the
strange
radiance
that
shines
for
her
as
for
venice
when
red
wine
of
sunset
and
purple
wine
of
night
mingle
together
in
the
gold
cup
of
the
west
at
such
a
time
she
is
a
second
venice
not
because
she
is
built
upon
piles
and
stands
upon
many
islands
linked
by
intricate
bridges
but
because
of
her
glow
and
dazzle
her
myriad
lights
breaking
suddenly
through
falling
dusk
to
splash
the
rose
and
violet
of
the
clouds
with
gilded
flecks
and
drop
silver
into
glimmering
canals
as
if
there
were
some
festive
illumination
because
of
her
huge
colorful
buildings
and
her
old
old
houses
bowing
and
bending
backward
and
forward
to
whisper
into
each
other
windows
across
the
darkness
of
narrow
streets
and
burning
lines
of
water
the
fierce
traffic
of
the
day
was
over
but
the
dam
roared
and
rumbled
in
vast
confusion
with
its
enormous
structures
black
against
the
moldering
ashes
of
sunset
a
cathedral
without
a
tower
a
palace
without
a
king
a
bishop
house
without
a
bishop
a
girl
without
a
lover
is
the
saying
that
amsterdammers
have
about
the
dam
and
i
repeated
it
as
we
drove
through
while
my
friends
searched
the
verification
of
the
saw
all
was
plain
enough
except
the
girl
without
a
lover
but
when
they
learned
that
she
was
a
stone
girl
on
a
pedestal
too
constricted
for
two
figures
they
pronounced
her
part
of
the
distich
undaunted
by
all
they
had
done
that
day
they
would
go
out
again
after
dinner
when
amsterdam
was
blue
and
silver
and
shining
steel
in
the
quiet
streets
with
a
flare
of
yellow
light
in
the
lively
ones
where
people
crowded
the
roadways
listening
to
the
crash
of
huge
or
shopping
until
ten
we
supped
at
the
biggest
in
europe
and
then
for
contrast
since
we
were
in
a
city
of
contrasts
i
took
them
to
the
quaintest
inn
of
amsterdam
a
queer
little
house
hiding
the
painted
wilderman
over
his
door
behind
a
big
archway
in
the
midst
of
all
that
is
most
modern
but
with
an
interior
of
a
rich
gloom
lit
by
glints
of
brass
and
gleams
of
pewter
which
would
have
delighted
rembrandt
next
day
it
was
to
his
house
in
the
strange
teeming
jewish
quarter
that
we
went
first
of
all
but
nell
and
phyllis
were
heartsick
to
find
the
rooms
once
rich
in
treasures
piled
untidily
with
curiosities
of
no
great
beauty
or
value
then
by
way
of
a
change
after
the
old
town
and
the
harbor
with
its
queer
houses
like
drunken
men
trying
to
prop
each
other
up
i
chose
the
heerengracht
all
the
city
has
of
the
richest
and
most
exclusive
but
the
tall
mansions
with
their
air
of
reserve
and
their
selfishly
hidden
gardens
struck
the
eye
coldly
and
not
even
my
tales
of
tapestry
lace
old
silver
and
above
all
persian
carpets
to
be
seen
behind
the
veiled
windows
could
arouse
the
ladies
curiosity
it
was
well
enough
to
have
built
amsterdam
in
concentric
crescents
with
the
heerengracht
in
the
center
and
to
say
arbitrarily
that
the
further
you
went
outwards
the
further
you
descended
in
the
social
scale
that
distinction
might
do
for
the
townspeople
as
for
them
they
would
rather
live
in
a
black
and
brown
house
in
the
keizergracht
with
a
crane
and
pulley
in
one
of
the
gables
and
white
frames
on
the
windows
than
in
this
dull
street
of
wealth
and
fashion
even
half
a
house
with
a
whole
door
of
my
own
like
most
dutch
houses
would
be
nicer
said
nell
yes
i
could
be
happy
in
with
my
little
stairway
and
hall
quite
to
myself
but
when
i
had
shown
her
my
favorite
bit
of
amsterdam
she
became
unfaithful
to
the
keizergracht
and
its
picturesque
fellows
to
reach
this
bit
we
turned
from
the
roar
of
a
noisy
street
and
were
at
once
in
the
calm
of
a
monastic
cloister
it
was
like
opening
a
door
in
the
twentieth
century
and
falling
down
a
step
into
the
seventeenth
to
find
time
lying
enchanted
in
a
spell
of
magic
sleep
what
we
saw
was
a
spacious
quadrangle
with
an
flowery
garden
in
the
midst
and
ranged
round
it
pretty
little
houses
each
one
a
gem
of
individuality
there
was
a
church
too
a
charming
church
and
in
the
quadrangle
nothing
stirred
but
gleams
of
light
on
polished
windows
and
birds
which
hopped
about
on
the
pavement
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
them
i
believe
they
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
who
hurriedly
changed
into
birds
just
while
we
are
here
but
will
change
back
into
little
trim
old
ladies
and
old
gentlemen
whispered
nell
for
it
seemed
sacrilege
to
break
the
silence
with
that
a
house
door
opened
and
just
such
an
old
lady
as
she
described
came
out
oh
she
did
know
we
were
here
she
wo
have
time
to
get
into
her
birdhood
now
chuckled
nell
so
she
making
the
best
of
it
but
see
she
turned
to
warn
her
husband
she
has
any
husband
said
i
how
can
you
tell
asked
the
girl
if
she
had
she
could
live
here
i
explained
because
this
is
the
begynenhof
half
almshouse
half
nunnery
which
has
been
kept
up
since
our
great
year
but
oddly
enough
the
chapel
of
the
sisterhood
who
established
it
has
been
turned
into
an
english
church
queer
in
the
little
catholic
village
hidden
away
from
the
great
city
but
so
it
is
and
is
it
a
serene
spot
almost
nicer
than
aalsmeer
murmured
the
chaperon
i
wonder
if
but
starr
was
at
the
door
of
the
exit
before
she
could
finish
wondering
the
palace
more
suitable
for
a
magnificent
town
hall
than
a
regal
dwelling
was
the
next
violent
contrast
in
my
bag
of
colors
but
royal
though
it
was
there
was
nothing
in
it
they
cared
for
much
except
the
which
they
had
to
admit
was
not
to
be
surpassed
there
were
a
few
too
which
the
chaperon
thought
she
would
accept
from
the
queen
as
presents
but
as
for
the
carpets
they
were
no
less
than
tragic
and
it
would
be
better
to
go
about
opening
bridges
or
laying
dull
cornerstones
then
stay
at
home
and
look
at
them
my
way
of
showing
amsterdam
was
to
work
slowly
up
to
a
grand
crescendo
effect
and
the
crescendo
was
the
ryks
museum
we
had
two
days
of
amsterdam
the
second
was
mostly
spent
at
the
diamond
cutters
before
i
suggested
the
museum
aunt
fay
said
when
i
did
that
she
hated
such
places
they
gave
her
a
headache
a
heartache
and
a
bad
cold
but
she
did
not
hate
the
ryks
museum
and
delighted
the
mariner
by
picking
out
the
best
rembrandts
after
our
first
day
at
the
museum
which
we
gave
to
the
pictures
she
could
have
had
anything
she
asked
from
her
dearest
ronny
then
there
were
the
dutch
rooms
and
the
rooms
where
the
wax
people
live
i
did
not
speak
of
the
wax
people
until
the
ladies
were
tired
therefore
they
were
cold
to
the
idea
of
wax
figures
even
when
they
heard
that
the
queen
had
been
five
or
six
times
to
see
them
perhaps
she
never
saw
madame
tussaud
remarked
miss
rivers
in
a
superior
british
way
but
the
magic
word
was
spoken
when
i
said
that
the
wax
people
wore
every
variety
of
costume
to
be
found
in
holland
and
i
was
ordered
to
conduct
the
party
to
them
at
once
instantly
they
felt
the
alarming
fascination
of
the
wax
faces
whose
hard
eyes
say
at
night
we
live
and
walk
about
as
you
are
doing
now
and
at
the
closing
hour
aunt
fay
and
the
two
girls
had
to
be
forcibly
torn
away
is
it
possible
that
some
day
we
shall
see
live
people
dressed
as
those
wax
people
are
she
exclaimed
you
will
see
them
by
the
hundred
i
answered
she
paused
a
moment
miss
van
buren
wants
to
know
if
one
can
buy
any
special
costume
to
which
one
takes
a
fancy
yes
if
one
does
mind
what
one
pays
i
answered
but
i
was
nettled
that
the
girl
could
not
have
asked
so
simple
a
question
herself
this
is
not
the
first
time
she
has
employed
a
to
find
out
something
which
i
alone
know
and
doubtless
there
will
be
more
occasions
if
i
let
things
go
on
as
they
are
going
now
but
i
do
mean
to
let
them
go
on
what
i
shall
do
i
have
made
up
my
mind
yet
some
step
must
be
taken
if
i
am
to
reap
anything
from
this
trip
except
a
harvest
of
snubbings
it
was
only
a
little
thing
that
she
should
question
me
through
her
chaperon
regarding
the
costumes
but
it
was
one
more
straw
in
a
rapidly
growing
bundle
and
on
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
from
the
museum
she
pretended
not
to
hear
when
i
spoke
she
discussed
with
starr
and
not
with
me
the
splendors
and
the
crudities
of
amsterdam
and
asked
if
he
did
detect
here
and
there
a
likeness
to
some
old
bit
of
new
york
new
amsterdam
of
course
he
agreed
and
they
talked
of
the
dutchness
of
poughkeepsie
and
albany
and
hudson
and
many
other
places
which
i
never
heard
of
no
wonder
that
there
was
triumph
in
the
glance
he
threw
me
alb
he
was
thinking
no
doubt
was
not
getting
much
fun
for
his
money
and
it
was
true
nevertheless
alb
was
not
discouraged
he
was
making
up
his
mind
that
the
time
for
quiet
patience
was
over
as
the
skipper
of
lorelei
had
engaged
for
something
better
xvi
by
jove
here
a
lark
exclaimed
starr
at
the
breakfast
table
looking
up
from
the
paris
it
was
at
the
amstel
hotel
on
our
fourth
morning
and
he
and
i
were
taking
coffee
together
as
an
ancient
mariner
and
his
albatross
should
the
ladies
had
not
yet
appeared
for
they
were
breakfasting
in
their
rooms
what
up
i
asked
it
under
the
latest
news
of
your
queen
doings
said
he
and
began
to
read
aloud
brederode
who
is
equally
popular
in
english
and
dutch
society
and
sporting
circles
has
taken
for
the
season
a
large
in
which
he
is
touring
the
waterways
of
holland
with
a
party
of
invited
friends
among
whom
is
lady
macnairne
it
was
her
portrait
as
everybody
knows
painted
by
the
clever
american
artist
starr
which
was
so
much
admired
at
the
paris
salon
this
spring
funny
how
they
strung
that
story
together
is
it
but
it
a
bore
er
in
the
circumstances
their
having
got
hold
of
my
name
people
who
weave
tangled
webs
must
be
surprised
if
they
get
caught
in
them
sometimes
said
i
i
wonder
how
miss
van
buren
will
like
this
she
sure
to
see
it
starr
went
on
reflectively
how
she
liked
it
mattered
more
to
me
than
to
anybody
else
because
if
she
disliked
it
i
was
the
person
upon
whom
her
vexation
would
be
visited
but
there
was
a
still
more
important
point
which
apparently
had
come
under
the
mariner
consideration
how
would
lady
macnairne
husband
like
it
evidently
starr
does
know
that
there
has
been
an
upset
of
some
sort
between
sir
alec
and
the
charming
fleda
and
as
fleda
is
his
aunt
but
has
not
confided
in
her
nephew
while
she
has
in
me
no
matter
what
trouble
the
newspaper
paragraph
may
cause
for
the
entire
party
it
would
be
a
breach
of
confidence
for
me
to
enlighten
him
by
jove
i
said
to
myself
what
will
macnairne
do
if
he
sees
in
the
paper
that
his
wife
who
has
run
away
from
home
without
telling
him
where
she
staying
is
the
principal
guest
on
board
a
boat
of
mine
i
ought
to
warn
starr
that
there
may
be
a
crash
but
i
ca
the
only
thing
i
could
do
was
to
pump
him
in
the
hope
that
he
knew
more
of
his
aunt
affairs
than
i
supposed
my
stock
pretty
far
down
in
the
market
with
miss
van
buren
already
said
i
it
ca
go
lower
i
wonder
how
these
asses
think
of
such
nonsense
but
i
suppose
it
came
of
registering
in
my
name
which
i
had
to
do
to
use
the
flag
of
the
sailing
and
rowing
club
of
rotterdam
somebody
heard
of
the
boat
being
registered
by
rudolph
brederode
and
the
consequences
but
where
is
lady
macnairne
heavens
do
yell
at
the
top
of
your
voice
groaned
starr
in
a
dreadful
whisper
there
may
be
some
one
at
the
next
table
who
can
speak
english
i
had
an
awful
lesson
as
nobody
knows
better
than
you
to
behave
in
a
restaurant
as
if
i
were
at
church
the
real
lady
who
is
at
the
present
moment
breakfasting
with
tibe
may
be
in
kamschatka
for
all
i
know
though
i
think
it
probable
she
not
all
i
know
is
that
she
never
answered
two
frantic
telegrams
of
mine
she
not
at
home
she
may
be
anywhere
else
except
in
holland
where
she
wanted
it
would
be
awkward
if
she
should
turn
up
now
i
remarked
wanted
i
ought
to
have
said
but
she
such
a
good
pal
i
should
fix
things
up
with
her
somehow
i
doubt
if
you
would
with
her
husband
i
thought
though
aloud
i
said
nothing
i
was
sure
now
that
he
was
in
ignorance
of
the
situation
blissful
ignorance
since
he
could
not
guess
what
developments
it
might
lead
to
for
him
and
for
the
chaperon
whom
he
had
provided
at
such
cost
if
anything
happens
i
shall
have
to
help
him
through
it
somehow
i
decided
as
it
more
than
half
my
fault
registering
in
my
name
besides
i
ca
let
the
party
be
broken
up
until
i
had
a
fair
chance
to
raise
brederode
stock
in
the
market
to
know
that
at
any
moment
sir
alec
macnairne
might
pounce
upon
us
denounce
the
chaperon
as
a
fraud
disgust
the
girls
with
starr
and
put
a
sudden
end
to
the
adventure
as
far
as
the
two
men
in
it
were
concerned
was
not
conducive
to
appetite
i
forgot
whether
i
had
just
begun
my
breakfast
or
just
finished
it
but
in
either
case
it
interested
me
no
more
than
eggs
and
toast
would
have
interested
damocles
at
the
moment
of
discovering
the
sword
the
principal
thing
is
not
to
let
the
girls
see
the
said
starr
i
wished
it
were
the
principal
thing
still
i
said
nothing
and
getting
up
we
went
into
the
hall
miss
van
buren
would
think
it
cool
of
you
perhaps
if
she
knew
registered
her
boat
in
your
name
said
starr
taking
up
the
subject
again
she
would
understand
would
miss
van
buren
think
cool
asked
miss
van
buren
voice
behind
us
and
the
mariner
started
as
if
we
were
conspirators
oh
nothing
particular
he
answered
limply
please
tell
me
i
tell
you
i
said
with
a
sudden
determination
that
she
should
know
the
worst
and
do
her
worst
and
be
conquered
by
something
stronger
than
her
prejudice
the
was
coming
between
us
now
that
i
had
been
expecting
and
almost
desiring
i
registered
your
boat
in
my
name
i
said
calmly
and
starr
thinks
you
would
understand
she
threw
up
her
head
flushing
i
understand
it
gives
us
the
right
to
use
the
flag
of
my
club
we
could
have
got
on
without
it
often
with
grave
inconvenience
i
would
have
risked
that
forgive
me
but
amateurs
are
always
ready
to
take
risks
at
this
moment
i
became
aware
that
starr
had
slipped
away
is
it
rather
late
she
flashed
at
me
to
ask
my
forgiveness
for
it
was
a
mere
civility
i
answered
with
equal
insolence
i
done
nothing
for
which
i
felt
the
need
of
your
forgiveness
miss
van
buren
but
if
you
think
i
have
pray
tell
me
once
for
all
what
it
was
that
i
may
defend
myself
you
do
feel
she
echoed
you
done
anything
for
which
you
need
my
oh
then
you
more
hardened
than
i
thought
i
hoped
that
by
this
time
you
were
repenting
repenting
of
what
of
everything
of
putting
yourself
in
your
present
position
among
other
things
you
mean
in
the
position
of
your
skipper
i
may
say
that
if
i
repented
it
is
your
fault
but
really
i
been
so
busy
trying
to
make
myself
useful
to
the
party
in
more
ways
than
one
that
i
had
no
time
for
repentance
oh
you
have
made
yourself
useful
she
had
the
grace
to
admit
if
it
had
been
for
the
i
i
should
have
been
grateful
you
know
things
which
none
of
the
rest
of
us
know
you
shown
us
sights
which
without
you
we
should
never
have
seen
or
heard
of
but
as
it
is
how
can
i
why
should
i
be
grateful
it
only
for
the
sake
of
the
others
and
their
pleasure
that
i
so
you
said
before
i
broke
in
but
now
i
refuse
to
accept
toleration
from
you
we
wo
say
consideration
for
that
too
warm
a
word
for
the
sake
of
others
the
boat
is
yours
i
am
your
skipper
if
after
serving
you
as
well
as
i
could
for
a
week
you
wish
me
to
go
i
will
go
she
stood
and
stared
at
me
from
under
lashes
meant
only
for
sweet
looks
you
will
go
certainly
this
moment
i
only
wait
your
word
i
heard
myself
saying
it
and
in
a
way
i
was
sincere
though
i
was
the
same
man
who
only
a
few
minutes
since
had
vowed
to
do
anything
rather
than
let
the
trip
end
of
course
i
would
have
to
go
now
if
she
told
me
to
go
but
i
knew
that
i
should
not
go
as
skipper
i
was
her
servant
if
she
chose
to
give
me
the
name
but
as
a
man
i
felt
myself
her
master
i
i
she
faltered
and
i
saw
her
throat
flutter
you
putting
me
in
a
horrid
position
we
i
thought
we
settled
this
matter
things
being
as
they
are
not
at
all
said
i
nothing
was
settled
you
starr
friend
and
i
ca
send
you
away
you
can
easily
i
replied
and
since
that
appears
to
be
your
only
reason
for
not
doing
so
i
not
wait
for
your
orders
to
go
miss
van
buren
i
do
my
best
to
get
you
another
skipper
a
professional
this
time
i
moved
a
step
away
and
my
blood
was
beating
fast
everything
depended
on
the
next
instant
stop
please
stop
she
said
i
stopped
and
looked
at
her
coldly
for
a
moment
we
stood
regarding
each
other
in
silence
for
it
seemed
that
having
detained
me
she
could
think
of
nothing
more
to
say
but
suddenly
she
broke
out
with
a
fierce
little
stamp
of
the
foot
sometimes
i
can
understand
why
it
was
that
philip
to
torture
the
dutch
it
was
all
i
could
do
not
to
burst
out
laughing
but
it
would
have
spoiled
everything
for
me
if
i
had
laughed
you
have
tortured
the
dutch
said
i
but
now
it
finished
the
dutch
have
tired
of
the
torture
oh
you
tired
then
you
had
go
i
suppose
why
are
you
waiting
you
stopped
me
for
something
what
was
it
i
hardly
know
it
was
only
i
was
going
to
propose
you
were
going
to
propose
that
you
stayed
a
little
longer
you
were
to
take
us
them
i
mean
on
an
excursion
in
your
they
getting
ready
now
they
be
disappointed
i
lend
you
them
my
car
and
my
chauffeur
no
it
would
be
horrid
without
y
it
would
be
too
ungracious
i
they
could
accept
i
sorry
do
you
think
maybe
you
better
stay
a
little
longer
no
miss
van
buren
i
go
now
or
i
go
with
you
to
the
end
i
wonder
if
she
guessed
just
what
i
meant
by
those
words
i
not
stop
after
what
passed
between
us
for
a
day
longer
except
on
two
conditions
conditions
make
conditions
with
me
certainly
i
have
the
right
you
are
extraordinary
i
am
a
dutchman
oh
here
comes
lady
macnairne
in
her
and
hood
she
bought
them
yesterday
because
they
what
excuse
can
i
make
oh
what
your
conditions
first
that
you
tell
me
you
want
me
to
stay
i
do
on
their
account
that
not
the
way
well
then
i
ask
you
to
stay
i
hope
your
next
condition
is
as
hard
you
must
be
the
judge
it
is
that
you
be
civil
to
me
and
friendly
at
least
in
appearance
i
have
done
and
will
do
my
best
for
you
and
in
return
i
have
no
more
snubs
but
if
they
been
deserved
no
i
wo
be
nor
will
again
miss
van
buren
here
comes
phil
now
in
motoring
things
oh
dear
have
it
as
you
like
i
will
be
nice
to
you
she
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
or
else
to
encourage
me
with
a
sample
of
future
treatment
and
giving
way
to
impulse
at
last
i
held
out
my
hand
shake
hands
on
the
bargain
then
and
it
signed
and
sealed
i
said
she
laid
her
fingers
delicately
in
mine
and
dared
not
look
resentful
when
i
gently
pressed
them
for
all
i
cared
she
might
see
the
paris
now
for
all
i
cared
the
sky
might
fall
xvii
never
was
man
in
better
mood
for
the
rush
and
thrill
of
the
motor
than
i
after
the
conquering
of
miss
van
buren
it
was
but
a
shadow
victory
a
tempest
in
a
yet
it
was
so
good
an
augury
of
a
further
triumph
for
which
i
hoped
in
future
that
the
joy
of
it
went
fizzily
to
my
head
and
i
could
have
shouted
if
i
had
been
alone
in
some
desert
place
with
nobody
by
to
know
that
it
was
a
dutchman
who
made
a
fool
of
himself
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
had
the
car
out
in
amsterdam
for
the
city
with
its
network
of
electric
trams
and
tremendous
traffic
is
far
from
ideal
for
motoring
and
i
wanted
to
keep
the
nerves
of
my
people
cool
for
therefore
the
automobile
had
been
eating
her
head
off
in
a
garage
while
we
pottered
about
in
cabs
driven
by
preposterously
old
gentlemen
bearded
as
to
their
chins
and
white
as
to
the
seams
of
their
coats
to
take
lorelei
to
all
the
places
i
meant
to
see
would
have
occupied
half
a
week
though
none
were
at
a
great
distance
from
amsterdam
but
the
waterways
there
do
not
in
all
places
connect
conveniently
for
a
boat
of
lorelei
size
though
we
might
have
left
waterspin
behind
so
i
proposed
the
car
and
everybody
caught
at
the
idea
there
was
not
one
of
the
party
who
by
this
time
had
not
studied
enough
to
know
something
of
muiden
laren
baarn
hilversum
and
amersfoort
but
they
might
have
searched
baedeker
and
all
his
rivals
from
end
to
end
without
finding
even
the
name
of
spaakenberg
and
little
quaint
hidden
spaakenberg
was
to
be
the
of
our
expedition
it
was
ten
when
i
got
them
all
including
tibe
into
the
car
indeed
it
always
seems
to
be
exactly
ten
when
we
start
on
any
excursion
even
when
it
has
been
decided
over
night
that
we
should
set
off
promptly
at
nine
but
starr
who
pretends
to
knowledge
of
ways
says
we
are
lucky
to
get
away
anywhere
before
eleven
seeing
that
at
the
last
moment
one
of
the
ladies
remembers
that
she
must
write
and
post
an
important
letter
which
will
take
only
five
minutes
or
she
finds
she
has
forgotten
her
purse
in
a
drawer
at
the
hotel
and
must
go
back
or
she
thinks
she
will
be
too
cool
or
too
hot
and
must
make
some
change
in
her
costume
or
if
nothing
of
this
sort
happens
tibe
is
lost
sight
of
for
a
second
and
disappears
in
pursuit
of
new
friendships
canine
or
human
he
has
then
not
only
to
be
retrieved
which
is
usually
an
affair
of
twenty
minutes
but
has
to
be
caressed
for
an
extra
five
by
his
mistress
who
never
fails
to
abandon
hope
of
seeing
him
again
the
moment
he
is
out
of
sight
to
test
the
quality
of
miss
van
buren
resolutions
i
asked
her
to
take
the
seat
beside
the
driver
expecting
some
excuse
but
she
came
like
a
lamb
and
the
taste
of
conquest
was
sweet
in
my
mouth
in
haarlem
all
had
proved
such
good
motorists
that
despite
the
ferocity
of
amsterdam
trams
i
was
scarcely
prepared
for
the
emotions
which
began
to
seethe
in
the
the
moment
the
car
was
started
and
the
chauffeur
had
sprung
to
his
place
at
my
feet
according
to
my
idea
there
no
courage
in
reckless
driving
but
selfishness
and
other
less
agreeable
qualities
still
we
did
not
exactly
dawdle
as
we
left
the
amstel
to
swing
out
into
the
tide
of
city
life
heavens
he
going
to
kill
us
i
heard
the
chaperon
groan
ronald
tell
him
to
stop
miss
rivers
was
also
giving
vent
to
despairing
murmurs
tibe
was
wuffing
threats
at
each
tram
which
loomed
toward
us
and
starr
was
attempting
to
advise
me
over
my
shoulder
that
the
ladies
would
wish
to
be
driven
less
furiously
to
my
joy
nell
looked
back
and
laughed
why
we
not
going
more
than
seven
miles
an
hour
said
she
then
for
goodness
sake
let
go
implored
her
chaperon
i
never
dreamed
of
anything
so
awful
i
slackened
pace
are
you
an
old
motorist
i
inquired
of
my
companion
as
if
i
were
used
to
asking
her
friendly
commonplace
questions
i
never
was
in
a
car
until
the
other
day
with
my
cousin
said
she
in
the
same
carefully
unconscious
tone
and
i
afraid
in
my
feet
and
hands
now
but
the
rest
of
me
is
enjoying
it
awfully
yes
that
the
word
i
think
for
it
rather
awful
i
should
have
dreamed
that
trams
could
look
so
big
or
bridges
so
narrow
except
in
nightmares
and
and
you
ca
make
your
horn
heard
can
you
over
the
noise
on
the
stones
oh
there
was
a
close
shave
with
that
wagon
was
it
i
felt
bristling
like
a
fretful
porcupine
oh
but
a
stark
staring
mad
blithering
porcupine
it
was
delicious
to
have
her
talk
to
me
and
to
feel
that
because
she
trusted
my
skill
she
was
not
really
afraid
but
only
excited
enough
to
forget
her
stiffness
perhaps
amsterdam
would
be
a
pleasant
place
to
learn
in
i
said
but
it
all
right
when
you
have
learned
it
a
good
thing
she
went
on
that
motoring
was
invented
by
some
grand
seignor
in
the
middle
ages
when
the
rich
thought
no
more
of
the
poor
than
we
do
of
flies
or
they
have
run
over
every
one
who
get
out
of
their
way
on
the
instant
they
have
had
a
sort
of
fitted
on
to
their
cars
to
keep
themselves
from
coming
to
harm
and
they
have
dashed
people
aside
anyhow
in
these
days
no
matter
how
hard
your
heart
may
be
you
have
to
sacrifice
your
inclinations
more
or
less
to
decency
i
dare
say
the
car
of
juggernaut
was
a
motor
oh
what
a
town
shall
we
ever
get
out
of
pandemonium
into
the
country
we
did
get
out
at
last
and
suddenly
for
in
hollow
land
the
line
between
town
and
country
is
abrupt
with
no
fading
of
city
into
suburb
and
meadow
one
moment
we
were
in
the
bustle
of
amsterdam
the
next
we
were
running
along
a
klinker
road
straight
as
a
ruler
beside
a
quiet
canal
such
horses
as
we
met
being
accustomed
to
the
traffic
of
amsterdam
had
no
fear
of
the
motor
which
was
well
for
on
so
narrow
a
road
with
the
canal
on
one
side
and
a
deep
drop
into
meadows
on
the
other
an
adventure
would
be
disagreeable
but
it
was
not
all
straight
sailing
ahead
outside
the
traffic
i
put
on
speed
to
make
up
for
lost
time
and
the
car
quickly
ate
up
the
distance
between
amsterdam
and
muiden
my
passengers
broke
into
admiration
of
the
medieval
fortress
with
its
paraphernalia
of
moats
bastions
and
drawbridges
which
give
an
air
of
historic
romance
to
the
country
round
but
their
emotion
would
have
been
of
a
different
kind
had
they
guessed
the
risk
we
must
take
in
running
through
the
winding
fortifications
it
was
not
so
great
a
risk
that
it
was
foolish
to
take
it
and
thirty
or
forty
cars
must
do
the
same
thing
every
day
but
the
fact
was
that
we
had
to
run
through
these
tunnels
on
with
no
room
to
turn
out
in
case
of
meeting
a
steam
monster
from
hilversum
i
had
chosen
my
time
knowing
the
hours
for
trams
still
had
there
been
a
delay
there
was
a
chance
of
a
crash
for
our
horn
could
not
be
heard
by
the
tram
driver
nor
could
he
see
us
in
time
to
put
on
his
brakes
and
prevent
a
collision
with
the
girl
i
love
beside
me
and
three
other
passengers
not
to
mention
the
chauffeur
it
was
with
a
tenseness
of
the
nerves
that
i
drove
through
the
labyrinth
and
i
was
glad
to
clear
muiden
next
came
naarden
that
tragic
naarden
whose
capture
and
sack
by
the
spaniards
encouraged
alva
to
attack
haarlem
and
then
without
one
of
the
party
having
dreamed
of
danger
we
swung
out
on
the
road
to
laren
a
road
set
in
pineland
and
heather
which
would
have
reminded
the
real
lady
macnairne
of
her
scottish
home
there
was
actually
something
like
a
hill
here
and
there
which
the
strangers
were
astonished
to
find
in
holland
and
would
hardly
believe
when
i
said
that
on
reaching
gelderland
i
would
be
able
to
show
them
a
dutch
mountain
two
hundred
feet
high
among
a
colony
of
smaller
eminences
to
which
half
the
netherlands
rush
in
summer
meanwhile
they
were
satisfied
with
what
they
saw
and
it
is
a
pretty
enough
road
this
way
between
amsterdam
and
laren
at
first
we
had
had
the
canal
with
its
sleepy
barges
peopled
with
large
families
and
towed
by
children
harnessed
in
tandem
at
the
end
of
long
ropes
its
little
shady
wayside
houses
with
melk
salon
printed
attractively
over
their
doors
we
had
had
avenues
of
trees
knotted
here
and
there
into
groves
we
had
passed
pretty
farmhouses
with
bright
and
pans
hanging
on
the
red
walls
like
placks
in
a
we
had
seen
gardens
flooded
with
roses
and
long
stretches
of
water
carpeted
with
lilies
white
and
yellow
then
we
had
come
to
pine
forests
and
heather
and
always
we
had
had
the
good
klinker
which
though
not
as
velvety
for
motoring
as
asphalt
is
free
from
dust
even
in
dry
weather
we
had
run
almost
continuously
on
our
fourth
speed
and
even
in
laren
i
came
down
to
the
second
only
long
enough
to
let
them
all
see
the
beauty
of
the
mauve
country
starr
knows
anton
mauve
pictures
and
his
history
but
the
ladies
had
seen
only
a
few
delicious
landscapes
in
the
ryks
museum
still
they
liked
to
hear
that
at
laren
corot
great
disciple
had
found
inspiration
nowhere
in
the
netherlands
are
there
such
beautiful
barns
each
one
of
which
is
a
background
for
a
nativity
picture
and
it
was
laren
peasants
laren
cows
and
the
sunlit
and
meadows
of
laren
which
kept
mauve
brush
busy
for
years
after
the
charm
of
haarlem
suburbs
hilversum
where
merchants
of
amsterdam
play
at
being
in
the
country
was
disappointing
but
having
lunched
in
open
air
and
spun
on
toward
amersfoort
we
ran
into
a
district
which
holds
some
delightful
houses
set
among
plane
trees
varied
with
flowering
acacias
and
plantations
of
oak
everywhere
our
eyes
followed
long
avenues
cut
in
the
forest
avenues
stretching
out
like
the
rays
of
a
star
and
full
of
a
tremulous
green
light
shot
with
gold
in
the
midst
of
this
forest
we
came
upon
soestdyk
where
the
lives
that
pleasant
palace
with
its
romance
of
a
mysterious
secret
room
then
we
ran
into
amersfoort
ringed
by
its
park
and
nell
was
so
entranced
with
the
gothic
church
tower
that
she
rejoiced
to
hear
it
was
the
finest
in
the
northern
netherlands
i
had
chosen
in
amersfoort
for
our
drive
and
as
we
sailed
into
the
spacious
square
of
the
town
my
passengers
saw
in
one
moment
more
dutch
costumes
than
in
all
their
previous
days
in
hollow
land
it
was
too
late
for
the
best
of
the
picture
still
the
glittered
with
gold
and
silver
helmets
and
delicate
spiral
flashed
in
the
sun
and
massive
gold
brooches
and
buckles
there
was
a
moving
rainbow
of
color
and
a
clatter
of
sabots
as
the
market
women
packed
up
their
wares
but
there
was
no
time
to
linger
if
we
were
to
reach
spaakenberg
before
the
shadows
grew
long
we
sped
on
until
the
next
we
had
come
to
so
many
that
nell
said
our
progress
was
made
by
tolling
rather
than
tooling
along
the
roads
where
a
nice
old
lady
shook
her
white
cap
at
the
motor
while
accepting
my
pennies
it
was
her
opinion
though
she
was
not
sure
that
the
road
oh
a
very
bad
road
to
spaakenberg
was
now
forbidden
to
automobiles
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
never
motored
to
spaakenberg
but
i
had
bicycled
and
thought
there
ought
to
be
room
on
the
narrow
road
for
two
vehicles
even
if
one
were
a
motor
and
the
other
a
i
was
not
surprised
that
the
old
lady
had
no
certainty
with
which
to
back
up
her
opinion
it
was
more
surprising
that
she
should
know
of
the
existence
of
spaakenberg
of
which
many
dutch
bicyclists
who
pride
themselves
on
their
knowledge
have
never
heard
naturally
we
determined
to
persevere
more
than
ever
eager
for
a
sight
of
the
strange
and
a
glimpse
of
the
zuider
zee
but
what
shall
we
do
if
we
find
the
road
forbidden
and
we
too
far
off
to
walk
nell
asked
it
would
be
dreadful
to
turn
back
we
sha
turn
back
said
i
we
hire
a
wagon
and
go
on
or
pass
the
sign
which
forbids
us
to
proceed
too
quickly
to
see
it
such
things
happen
and
the
road
too
narrow
to
turn
or
even
to
reverse
i
am
glad
you
a
dutchman
said
she
why
because
i
know
the
ropes
no
because
you
die
rather
than
give
up
anything
you
set
out
to
do
it
was
now
as
if
the
old
prophetess
had
bewitched
the
country
the
monarchs
of
the
forest
fled
away
and
left
us
in
the
open
with
a
narrow
strip
of
road
between
a
canal
loaded
with
and
meadows
of
yellow
grain
the
landscape
was
charming
and
the
air
balmy
with
summer
but
with
the
first
horse
we
met
all
peace
was
over
here
were
no
longer
the
beasts
of
a
sophisticated
world
animals
of
this
region
had
never
seen
a
town
larger
than
amersfoort
a
was
to
them
as
horrifying
an
object
as
a
lion
escaping
from
his
cage
at
a
circus
horses
reared
swayed
peasants
shrieked
maledictions
or
shook
fists
but
always
crawling
at
snail
pace
we
managed
to
scrape
past
without
accident
sometimes
we
frightened
cows
and
a
couple
of
great
yellow
dogs
drawing
a
cart
which
contained
two
peasant
girls
in
costume
swore
canine
oaths
against
the
car
illustration
couple
of
great
yellow
dogs
drawing
a
cart
swore
canine
oaths
against
the
oh
mercy
we
just
passed
a
sign
in
dutch
forbidden
cried
nell
well
we
passed
it
said
i
perhaps
it
meant
that
side
road
narrower
than
ours
let
think
it
did
so
we
gave
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
fled
on
until
in
less
than
an
hour
we
flashed
into
a
they
all
cried
spaakenberg
and
the
zuider
zee
but
as
it
was
not
spaakenberg
i
gave
them
only
a
flashing
glimpse
of
masts
and
dark
blue
water
half
a
mile
drive
along
a
canal
and
we
came
to
our
destination
and
of
spaakenberg
the
first
thing
we
saw
was
a
forest
of
masts
with
nets
like
sails
brown
yet
transparent
as
fifty
sturdy
were
grouped
together
in
a
basin
of
quiet
water
within
sight
of
the
zuider
zee
which
calls
to
men
on
every
clear
night
the
fish
are
waiting
i
stopped
and
as
we
counted
the
boats
the
whole
population
of
spaakenberg
issued
from
small
houses
to
see
what
monster
made
so
odd
a
noise
by
twenties
and
by
thirties
they
came
wonderful
figures
and
the
air
rang
with
the
music
of
sabots
on
klinker
there
were
young
women
carrying
tiny
round
babies
there
were
old
women
who
had
all
they
could
do
to
carry
themselves
there
were
little
girls
gravely
knitting
their
brothers
stockings
and
toddling
creatures
so
infinitesimal
that
one
could
not
guess
whether
they
would
grow
up
male
or
female
there
were
men
too
but
not
many
young
ones
and
there
were
plenty
of
boys
as
for
the
women
and
girls
they
wore
heaven
knows
how
many
petticoats
seven
or
eight
at
the
minimum
and
their
figures
went
out
at
the
places
where
they
should
have
gone
in
and
went
in
at
the
places
where
they
should
have
gone
out
they
were
like
the
ladies
with
panniers
on
each
side
and
those
who
could
not
afford
enough
petticoats
had
padded
out
their
own
and
their
children
hips
to
supply
the
right
effect
some
had
black
hoods
with
furry
rolls
round
their
faces
some
heightened
the
brilliancy
of
their
complexion
by
caps
of
white
lace
according
to
their
religion
whether
they
were
of
the
catholic
or
protestant
faith
and
the
babies
in
black
hoods
and
black
skirts
reaching
to
their
feet
were
the
quaintest
figures
of
all
the
men
and
boys
in
their
indigo
blouses
were
not
living
pictures
like
their
female
relatives
save
when
with
bright
blue
yokes
over
their
shoulders
from
which
swung
green
pails
foaming
with
yellow
cream
they
returned
from
milking
black
and
white
cows
unspoiled
by
the
influx
of
strangers
the
simple
people
thronged
round
us
not
for
what
they
might
get
but
for
what
they
could
see
we
were
quainter
to
them
than
they
to
us
and
tibe
was
as
rare
as
a
dragon
his
mistress
was
of
opinion
that
they
believed
the
noise
of
the
motor
now
stilled
to
have
issued
from
his
black
velvet
muzzle
and
when
we
all
including
the
bulldog
got
out
to
wander
past
the
rows
of
tiny
houses
in
the
village
they
swarmed
round
him
buzzed
round
him
whirled
round
him
to
his
confusion
escape
seemed
hopeless
when
nell
and
phyllis
had
an
inspiration
they
rushed
in
at
the
door
of
a
miniature
shop
with
a
few
picture
postcards
and
sweets
in
glass
jars
displayed
in
a
dark
window
three
minutes
later
they
fought
their
way
out
through
the
crowd
of
strange
dolls
come
alive
and
like
a
farmer
sowing
seed
strewed
pink
and
white
lozenges
over
the
heads
of
girls
and
boys
instantly
the
clang
of
the
wooden
shoon
ceased
down
squatted
the
children
with
the
suddenness
of
collapsed
umbrellas
there
was
a
scramble
and
we
seized
the
opportunity
for
flight
we
had
seen
the
zuider
zee
we
had
seen
the
cows
in
blue
coats
we
had
seen
spaakenberg
and
spaakenberg
had
seen
us
xviii
returning
by
way
of
wooded
baarn
we
spun
back
to
amsterdam
when
violet
shadows
lengthened
over
golden
meadows
and
gauzy
floated
above
the
canal
burnished
to
silver
by
the
sunset
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
but
dine
and
plan
for
which
i
had
mapped
out
in
my
mind
subject
to
approval
but
i
let
them
all
talk
as
i
often
do
without
saying
anything
until
they
turn
to
me
with
a
question
there
an
island
which
people
say
is
wonderful
and
you
must
miss
it
remarked
the
chaperon
but
i
forgotten
the
name
why
is
it
wonderful
asked
miss
rivers
i
ca
remember
but
there
was
something
different
about
it
from
what
you
can
see
anywhere
else
dear
me
how
awkward
how
you
to
find
it
sighed
phyllis
ask
alb
to
rapidly
mention
all
islands
in
holland
and
perhaps
it
will
come
back
to
you
suggested
the
mariner
begin
with
a
alb
not
worth
while
wasting
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
said
i
lady
macnairne
the
name
invariably
sticks
in
my
throat
means
marken
it
exclaimed
the
chaperon
how
could
you
guess
there
only
one
island
that
people
talk
about
like
that
i
replied
it
the
great
show
place
and
it
like
going
to
the
theater
the
curtain
rings
up
when
the
audience
arrives
and
rings
down
when
it
departs
you
see
my
idea
was
to
take
you
there
unless
you
prefer
another
place
i
looked
at
the
mistress
of
the
boat
and
no
hardness
came
into
her
eyes
the
contrast
between
her
manner
yesterday
and
her
manner
since
this
morning
was
so
marked
that
instead
of
being
wholly
pleased
i
was
half
alarmed
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
that
her
feelings
should
have
changed
and
that
the
sun
should
continue
to
shine
why
certainly
let
go
to
marken
she
said
i
was
thinking
of
as
i
read
it
was
near
and
the
sweetest
place
in
holland
however
we
can
go
if
but
my
plan
includes
gives
you
a
glimpse
of
monnikendam
takes
you
to
marken
and
winds
up
at
volendam
beloved
of
artists
said
i
i
do
believe
we
find
it
easy
to
tear
starr
from
volendam
so
it
was
settled
and
every
one
agreed
to
be
ready
at
ten
next
morning
but
ten
came
and
no
nell
no
phyllis
no
chaperon
my
car
was
at
the
door
as
i
intended
to
save
time
by
motoring
to
the
club
harbor
where
the
yacht
was
lying
and
when
starr
and
i
had
waited
in
the
hall
for
some
minutes
aunt
fay
appeared
have
the
girls
come
in
yet
with
tibe
she
asked
there
was
a
note
of
anxiety
in
her
voice
though
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
blue
spectacles
are
very
large
the
wings
of
gray
hair
droop
very
low
a
perky
bow
of
white
gauzy
stuff
worn
under
the
chin
comes
up
very
high
and
the
face
is
very
small
it
is
difficult
to
tell
by
the
expression
what
she
may
be
feeling
indeed
there
is
remarkably
little
room
for
an
expression
to
be
revealed
which
adds
to
the
mystery
of
the
chaperon
personality
are
they
out
asked
starr
yes
but
they
promised
to
be
back
at
a
quarter
to
ten
without
fail
or
i
should
have
let
them
go
tibe
had
no
breakfast
and
he
have
his
teeth
brushed
before
we
start
oh
dear
i
afraid
happened
for
goodness
sake
do
be
excited
you
get
such
an
american
accent
when
you
excited
whispered
the
mariner
fiercely
be
brave
remember
you
a
scotswoman
if
i
lose
tibe
i
shall
be
a
madwoman
she
retorted
you
wo
lose
him
alb
and
i
care
at
least
as
much
for
the
girls
as
you
do
for
your
dog
and
we
not
worrying
that
different
the
girls
do
belong
to
you
almost
wept
the
tiny
creature
you
have
fed
them
and
brushed
them
and
washed
their
feet
every
day
of
their
lives
since
they
were
a
few
months
old
as
i
have
with
tibe
and
if
you
not
nice
to
me
you
never
will
we
never
dared
hope
for
quite
as
much
as
that
said
starr
but
we
being
nice
to
you
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
they
half
an
hour
behind
time
shall
we
give
an
order
for
the
town
crier
i
dare
say
there
one
in
use
still
as
this
is
holland
if
you
sarcastic
ronald
i
you
the
moment
i
have
my
darling
tibe
again
replied
the
chaperon
and
the
threat
reduced
ronald
to
crushed
silence
what
took
them
out
so
early
in
the
morning
i
asked
oh
tibe
escaped
from
my
room
for
a
minute
and
was
eating
a
boot
which
he
found
at
somebody
door
a
horrid
boot
i
sure
it
could
have
been
good
for
him
and
the
two
girls
brought
him
back
they
were
going
out
for
one
last
glimpse
of
that
quaint
hidden
square
you
call
village
which
they
longed
to
see
again
and
they
asked
if
they
should
take
tibe
so
i
said
yes
as
he
fond
of
driving
oh
they
were
driving
said
i
yes
they
could
easily
have
been
in
long
ago
there
have
been
an
accident
miss
rivers
is
always
so
depressingly
prompt
such
a
strange
girl
she
considers
it
quite
a
sin
to
break
a
promise
even
to
a
man
and
she
seems
actually
to
telling
the
truth
we
soothed
the
chaperon
fears
as
well
as
we
could
but
when
ten
came
and
there
were
still
no
signs
of
the
missing
ones
we
both
began
to
be
troubled
if
they
do
appear
in
ten
minutes
i
drive
slowly
in
the
direction
by
which
they
should
return
i
said
but
the
words
had
hardly
left
my
lips
when
the
girls
walked
into
the
hall
with
tibe
both
charming
faces
were
flushed
and
it
was
evident
that
something
exciting
had
happened
but
whatever
it
was
nobody
was
the
worse
for
it
tibe
flew
to
his
mistress
knocking
down
a
child
and
almost
upsetting
an
old
gentleman
by
darting
unexpectedly
between
his
legs
while
the
girls
rushed
into
explanations
we
so
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
but
we
had
an
adventure
cried
nell
we
were
driving
back
from
the
when
tibe
gave
a
leap
and
jumped
out
of
the
cab
before
we
could
hold
him
we
were
broke
in
phyllis
and
he
disappeared
in
the
most
horribly
mysterious
way
finished
nell
we
thought
some
one
in
the
crowd
must
have
stolen
him
so
we
stopped
the
cab
and
began
tearing
about
looking
for
him
asking
every
human
being
in
every
known
language
dutch
if
they
seen
a
dog
or
a
or
a
but
nobody
understood
so
we
went
into
a
lot
of
shops
and
he
was
in
any
of
them
and
we
were
in
we
should
have
come
back
without
him
i
should
think
not
cut
in
the
chaperon
and
we
were
on
the
way
to
the
nearest
with
a
dear
old
gentleman
who
could
speak
english
and
a
whole
procession
of
extraneous
creatures
who
could
when
we
saw
tibe
calmly
driving
in
a
carriage
with
a
strange
man
and
he
never
so
much
as
looked
at
us
but
we
were
we
could
be
mistaken
at
least
nell
was
so
we
deserted
our
old
gentleman
and
began
running
after
tibe
carriage
shrieking
for
it
to
stop
naturally
every
one
thought
we
were
mad
but
we
did
care
and
at
last
the
man
in
the
carriage
realized
we
were
after
him
if
he
stopped
we
should
have
known
that
he
deliberately
stolen
tibe
but
he
did
stop
and
we
said
both
together
it
was
our
dog
the
man
took
off
his
hat
and
answered
in
english
such
a
nice
man
and
quite
with
a
big
mustache
and
blue
eyes
he
said
that
the
first
thing
he
knew
tibe
had
jumped
into
his
cab
and
he
had
no
idea
where
he
came
from
as
he
been
reading
in
a
but
the
strangest
thing
was
he
felt
certain
tibe
had
belonged
to
when
a
puppy
only
his
dog
was
named
tibe
but
john
bull
bully
for
short
and
he
sold
him
to
an
american
because
it
turned
out
his
wife
did
like
bulldogs
in
the
house
she
thought
them
too
ugly
what
a
interpolated
the
chaperon
could
it
be
possible
that
tibe
ever
his
asked
nell
he
sold
his
dog
just
a
year
ago
when
he
was
six
months
old
i
bought
tibe
ten
months
ago
poor
lamb
for
a
song
because
he
was
ill
he
been
seasick
on
a
long
voyage
so
i
nursed
him
up
and
what
he
is
now
said
tibe
mistress
it
may
be
he
belonged
to
this
man
for
it
always
the
strangest
things
that
are
true
tibe
has
a
wonderful
memory
for
faces
but
i
sure
if
i
been
with
him
he
would
have
run
away
from
me
for
twenty
old
masters
the
queerest
thing
in
the
adventure
is
that
this
master
must
be
some
relation
of
yours
lady
macnairne
said
nell
he
gave
us
his
card
see
here
it
is
she
handed
it
to
the
chaperon
who
gazed
at
it
through
her
blue
spectacles
for
a
moment
without
speaking
then
passed
it
to
starr
merely
a
relation
by
marriage
said
she
quite
a
distant
relation
i
never
saw
this
gentleman
myself
but
i
believe
you
met
him
have
you
dear
ronny
there
is
plenty
of
room
on
the
mariner
face
for
expression
he
grew
red
and
his
eyebrows
were
eloquent
as
he
looked
at
the
card
oh
er
yes
i
seen
him
i
think
he
mumbled
when
i
was
in
scotland
last
odd
he
happens
to
be
here
he
only
arrived
this
morning
on
important
business
nell
explained
if
it
were
for
that
he
would
have
asked
to
bring
us
back
to
our
hotel
but
it
was
something
that
had
to
be
attended
to
without
a
moment
delay
so
he
was
obliged
to
leave
us
at
once
he
was
on
the
way
to
the
hotel
de
where
he
hoped
to
find
the
people
he
come
to
seek
no
need
for
me
to
see
that
card
i
knew
well
who
was
the
hero
of
the
girls
adventure
and
would
have
guessed
without
the
aid
of
expression
he
saw
that
i
guessed
and
turned
to
me
with
a
look
of
appeal
well
at
all
events
tibe
is
safe
i
said
and
we
ought
to
start
if
we
to
get
through
our
program
ladies
is
your
luggage
ready
i
see
that
tibe
has
a
nice
bone
instead
of
breakfast
he
can
eat
it
in
the
car
going
to
the
boat
and
as
it
dusty
you
had
better
put
on
your
when
you
leave
the
hotel
starr
and
i
are
going
to
wear
goggles
alb
said
starr
as
the
ladies
moved
away
you
may
have
a
bad
heart
but
you
have
a
good
head
disguise
and
flight
are
our
only
hope
if
sir
alec
should
recognize
me
if
he
should
recognize
me
i
echoed
inwardly
the
game
would
be
up
speed
veils
and
goggles
may
do
the
trick
said
i
but
afterwards
by
jove
what
we
let
in
for
we
must
set
our
wits
to
work
change
name
and
disappear
into
space
five
minutes
later
we
were
off
unrecognizable
by
our
best
friends
and
tibe
well
hidden
deeply
interested
in
his
bone
at
the
bottom
of
the
but
hardly
were
we
away
when
miss
rivers
cried
out
oh
look
nell
there
sir
alec
macnairne
ought
we
to
stop
a
minute
so
that
lady
macnairne
i
afraid
we
have
time
i
said
hastily
and
put
on
speed
as
much
as
i
dared
in
traffic
we
whizzed
by
a
cab
and
might
have
passed
the
man
who
sat
in
it
with
his
hastily
packed
i
warrant
had
not
the
two
girls
bowed
their
faces
were
not
to
be
recognized
behind
the
small
triangular
tale
windows
of
the
silk
and
lace
they
bought
in
haarlem
but
their
bow
attracted
sir
alec
macnairne
attention
and
those
blue
eyes
of
his
looked
the
whole
party
over
as
he
lifted
his
hat
from
his
crisply
curling
auburn
hair
he
probably
divined
that
the
two
veiled
figures
must
be
the
girls
of
his
late
adventure
and
as
he
was
now
acquainted
with
them
and
with
tibe
there
would
be
one
less
chance
of
our
boat
slipping
away
from
under
his
nose
in
case
he
got
upon
our
track
i
realized
that
sir
alec
could
not
have
been
in
scotland
when
the
fatal
paragraph
appeared
which
reached
our
eyes
only
yesterday
if
he
had
been
he
could
not
have
arrived
in
amsterdam
my
idea
now
is
that
he
must
have
come
abroad
in
search
of
his
wife
have
seen
the
paris
at
some
continental
resort
and
have
rushed
off
to
holland
expecting
to
find
her
exactly
why
he
should
have
chosen
amsterdam
to
begin
his
quest
is
not
so
clear
but
he
must
have
had
reason
to
hope
that
he
might
get
news
of
lady
macnairne
and
my
supposed
here
doubtless
he
will
sooner
or
later
come
upon
a
clue
if
he
turns
up
at
the
amstel
to
prosecute
his
inquiries
he
may
hear
of
tibe
and
of
the
two
beautiful
young
ladies
then
he
will
put
two
and
two
together
and
will
be
after
us
as
starr
favorite
expression
is
before
we
can
say
knife
at
present
i
have
all
the
sensations
of
being
a
villain
with
none
of
the
advantages
xix
it
seemed
homelike
to
be
on
board
lorelei
again
in
my
place
at
the
wheel
with
the
two
girls
and
the
chaperon
in
their
close
by
starr
had
been
meaning
to
make
a
sketch
of
the
group
under
the
awning
but
the
dread
apparition
of
his
aunt
husband
had
twisted
his
nerves
like
wires
struck
by
lightning
and
he
could
do
nothing
his
is
essentially
the
artistic
temperament
and
he
is
a
creature
of
moods
impish
in
some
poetic
in
others
an
extraordinary
fellow
like
no
one
i
ever
saw
yet
curiously
fascinating
and
i
find
myself
growing
oddly
fond
of
him
in
an
protecting
sort
of
way
even
i
have
my
moods
sometimes
though
i
can
hide
them
better
than
he
can
and
this
morning
i
was
in
the
wrong
key
for
the
idyllic
peace
and
prim
prettiness
of
i
should
have
liked
better
to
be
out
on
a
meer
in
friesland
in
a
stiff
breeze
but
since
it
had
to
be
broek
i
made
the
best
of
it
the
canal
leading
to
that
sleepy
little
village
which
seems
to
float
on
the
water
like
a
lily
is
one
of
the
prettiest
in
the
netherlands
almost
at
once
after
parting
from
amsterdam
we
turned
out
of
the
north
sea
canal
and
the
smoke
and
bustle
of
the
port
were
left
behind
like
a
troubled
dream
we
lifted
a
veil
of
sunbright
mist
and
found
ourselves
in
the
country
a
friendly
country
of
wide
spaces
such
as
we
passed
through
in
motoring
between
amersfoort
and
spaakenberg
of
mossy
farmhouses
and
hayfields
grazing
cows
and
swallows
skimming
low
over
little
carpeted
with
vegetation
like
a
netting
of
green
beads
but
here
the
hay
was
not
protected
by
the
elevated
roofs
of
thatch
we
had
seen
yesterday
it
lay
in
loose
heaps
of
yellowing
grass
shining
in
the
sun
like
giant
birds
nests
of
woven
gold
and
all
the
landscape
shimmered
pale
golden
and
filmy
green
too
sweet
and
fresh
for
the
green
of
any
other
country
save
mine
in
here
and
there
a
peasant
in
some
striking
costume
or
a
horse
in
a
blue
coat
made
a
spot
of
color
in
the
pearl
and
primrose
light
under
clouds
changeful
as
opal
and
each
separate
dainty
picture
of
farmhouse
or
lock
or
group
of
flags
and
reeds
had
its
double
in
the
water
lying
bright
and
clear
as
a
painting
under
glass
until
our
vandal
boat
came
to
shiver
picture
after
picture
as
we
moved
our
progress
not
only
sent
an
advance
wave
racing
along
the
dyke
but
tossed
up
a
procession
of
tiny
rainbow
fountains
as
if
we
threw
handfuls
of
sapphires
and
diamonds
into
the
water
in
passing
sometimes
we
had
glimpses
of
mysterious
villages
a
line
of
houses
stretching
along
the
canal
banks
below
the
level
of
the
water
shielded
by
rows
of
trees
trained
in
the
dutch
way
to
grow
flat
and
wide
screening
the
windows
as
an
open
fan
screens
the
sparkling
eyes
of
a
woman
who
peeps
behind
its
sticks
these
inspired
starr
to
launch
out
in
a
disquisition
upon
some
of
the
characteristics
he
has
observed
among
my
people
funny
thing
said
starr
the
dutch
are
a
queer
mixture
of
reserve
and
curiosity
you
do
see
a
town
or
village
where
the
windows
covered
with
curtains
and
protected
by
squares
of
blue
netting
but
though
the
beings
behind
those
windows
are
so
anxious
to
live
in
private
they
consumed
with
curiosity
about
what
going
on
outside
for
fear
of
missing
something
they
stick
up
on
the
walls
to
tell
them
what
happens
in
the
street
unseen
is
the
motto
that
ought
to
be
written
over
the
house
doors
the
lady
of
shalott
started
the
fashion
said
nell
as
we
drew
nearer
to
the
landscape
already
fragrant
with
daintiness
began
to
tidy
itself
anew
out
of
deference
to
reputation
the
smallest
and
rudest
wooden
houses
on
the
canal
banks
had
frilled
their
windows
with
stiff
white
curtains
and
tied
them
with
ribbon
railings
had
painted
themselves
blue
or
green
and
smartened
their
tips
with
white
even
the
rakes
hoes
and
implements
of
labor
had
got
themselves
up
in
red
and
yellow
and
green
buckets
had
scarlet
mouths
as
we
walked
to
the
village
after
mooring
lorelei
at
the
bridge
the
girls
laughed
and
chatted
together
but
involuntarily
they
hushed
their
voices
on
entering
the
green
shadow
of
the
little
town
under
its
procession
of
great
trees
and
the
spell
of
somnolent
silence
seized
them
i
think
no
one
coming
into
could
escape
that
spell
there
is
no
noise
there
even
the
trees
whisper
and
not
the
most
badly
brought
up
dog
would
dare
to
bark
aloud
have
you
noticed
nell
asked
me
softly
that
you
never
hear
in
dreams
no
matter
how
exciting
things
are
there
never
any
noise
everything
seems
to
be
acted
in
pantomime
well
it
like
that
here
we
dreaming
as
we
have
other
places
and
dreaming
each
other
too
i
should
wonder
then
i
hope
nothing
will
happen
to
wake
me
up
just
then
we
arrived
at
a
dream
which
gave
her
an
excuse
not
to
answer
on
the
edge
of
the
town
it
stands
one
of
the
first
among
the
little
old
houses
which
look
as
if
they
had
been
made
to
accommodate
dolls
of
a
century
or
two
ago
modestly
retired
in
a
doll
garden
with
an
imitation
stalactite
grotto
and
groups
of
miniature
statues
among
animals
its
door
is
always
open
to
welcome
visitors
and
allure
them
within
vague
splashes
of
color
against
a
dim
background
blues
that
mean
old
delft
yellow
that
means
ancient
brass
and
all
gleaming
in
the
dusk
with
the
strange
values
that
flowers
gain
in
twilight
i
knew
that
nell
and
phyllis
and
the
chaperon
would
not
pass
by
and
they
did
there
was
a
man
inside
but
he
did
not
ask
us
to
buy
anything
he
had
the
air
of
a
host
pleased
to
show
his
treasures
and
the
chaperon
feared
that
i
was
playing
some
joke
when
i
encouraged
them
to
invade
the
quaint
and
pretty
rooms
i
do
believe
it
a
shop
said
she
it
just
an
eccentric
little
house
that
belongs
to
somebody
who
away
a
dear
old
maiden
lady
perhaps
a
collector
of
antiques
for
her
own
pleasure
this
her
caretaker
she
strayed
into
some
other
dream
maybe
suggested
nell
lost
her
way
poor
old
dear
and
can
never
find
it
again
to
come
back
so
that
why
the
things
are
for
sale
if
they
really
but
listen
all
the
clocks
in
the
house
are
talking
to
each
other
about
her
expect
her
to
come
and
that
why
they
keep
on
ticking
through
the
years
to
make
the
time
seem
short
in
passing
for
some
of
them
must
have
had
their
hundredth
birthday
long
long
ago
he
a
faithful
caretaker
then
to
keep
everything
in
such
good
order
said
phyllis
but
perhaps
he
believes
what
the
clocks
are
saying
about
the
old
lady
coming
back
he
got
the
sweetest
little
clean
curtains
at
the
windows
and
this
too
adorable
is
ready
for
her
to
hop
into
and
dream
the
right
dream
again
he
be
mobbed
by
other
broekites
if
he
did
keep
things
clean
i
answered
you
know
is
supposed
to
be
the
cleanest
place
in
the
netherlands
which
is
something
of
a
boast
is
it
the
saying
used
to
be
that
if
a
leaf
dropped
off
a
tree
or
a
wisp
of
hay
off
a
passing
cart
and
one
of
the
inhabitants
saw
it
he
ran
out
of
his
house
and
threw
the
dreadful
thing
into
the
canal
let
scatter
a
few
bits
of
paper
said
starr
and
see
what
would
happen
i
afraid
they
not
as
observant
or
energetic
as
they
used
to
be
i
counted
three
straws
on
the
bricks
coming
up
what
would
i
give
to
have
lunch
in
this
house
on
that
charming
old
mahogany
table
with
those
delft
plates
and
pewter
mugs
sighed
miss
rivers
her
eyes
traveling
over
the
old
furniture
which
as
she
said
seems
to
be
ready
and
waiting
till
the
wrong
dream
shall
break
i
going
to
take
you
to
lunch
somewhere
else
i
told
her
but
you
can
buy
delft
plates
and
pewter
mugs
here
for
your
own
table
if
you
like
then
some
exchange
and
barter
did
take
place
although
nell
said
it
seemed
cruel
to
buy
anything
and
separate
it
from
its
old
friends
one
ought
to
apologize
to
the
things
that
were
left
for
tearing
their
companions
away
there
was
time
to
step
into
the
nearest
cheese
factory
and
to
go
on
and
see
the
old
church
i
said
if
they
did
mind
lunching
late
of
course
they
did
not
so
we
strolled
into
the
show
place
of
broek
a
large
house
where
cows
live
in
neat
bedrooms
carpeted
with
something
which
resembles
grated
cheese
the
chaperon
suggested
that
after
all
it
was
nothing
but
sawdust
and
probably
she
was
right
nevertheless
each
little
cubicle
in
the
long
row
with
its
curtained
window
and
wall
looked
pretty
enough
for
a
fastidious
human
being
we
should
have
lingered
looking
at
the
cheeses
and
sniffing
dairy
smells
but
suddenly
a
tidal
wave
of
tourists
from
an
excursion
steamer
swept
in
swamped
us
and
swallowed
tibe
he
was
retrieved
after
a
search
in
the
doorway
of
the
whither
he
had
wisely
returned
to
await
his
friends
and
we
then
went
on
past
the
meer
with
its
deserted
bandstand
to
one
of
the
few
lovable
churches
left
in
my
country
it
is
whitewashed
and
bare
but
somehow
instead
of
making
it
grim
the
whiteness
has
given
it
a
religious
look
the
old
canopied
rosewood
pulpit
makes
you
feel
good
though
not
disagreeably
good
and
the
is
a
joy
you
seen
a
comic
opera
cheese
factory
said
i
when
we
had
left
the
church
now
i
show
you
the
real
thing
and
then
you
shall
have
lunch
it
wo
be
conventional
but
i
think
you
like
it
for
heaven
sake
let
drown
our
sorrows
in
cheese
or
something
else
supporting
and
soon
or
we
perish
said
the
mariner
our
blood
will
then
be
upon
your
head
and
as
it
blue
and
you
brown
it
wo
be
at
all
becoming
at
this
i
hurried
them
on
and
presently
arrived
at
a
house
set
in
a
little
garden
the
glass
of
the
windows
and
the
varnished
woodwork
of
the
door
at
which
i
knocked
glittered
so
intolerably
that
they
hurt
the
eyes
and
made
one
envy
the
chaperon
her
blue
glasses
it
was
a
relief
when
the
dazzling
door
flew
back
to
disclose
a
dim
interior
and
a
delightful
old
lady
in
a
gold
helmet
a
black
dress
and
an
elaborate
apron
something
to
eat
she
echoed
my
demand
but
mynheer
we
have
nothing
which
these
ladies
would
fancy
for
you
two
we
could
do
well
enough
for
you
are
men
and
young
what
does
it
matter
what
you
eat
if
it
is
enough
these
ladies
will
laugh
at
our
fare
they
laugh
with
pleasure
said
i
you
can
give
us
eggs
cheese
bread
and
butter
and
coffee
ca
you
and
strawberries
and
cream
perhaps
yes
mynheer
and
some
fresh
cake
food
for
kings
and
queens
as
you
serve
it
i
assured
her
and
we
flocked
into
the
hall
would
you
like
to
show
your
friends
how
we
make
our
cheese
while
i
get
ready
the
food
asked
the
dame
if
you
would
i
will
send
for
my
son
to
guide
you
though
you
know
it
so
well
yourself
mynheer
you
need
no
explanations
her
son
being
one
of
the
principal
objects
of
interest
at
wilhelminaberg
however
the
visit
would
not
be
complete
without
his
society
and
his
presence
was
commanded
promptly
he
appeared
bringing
with
him
a
smell
of
clover
and
milk
and
cheese
a
young
man
with
the
long
clever
nose
narrow
blue
eyes
and
length
of
upper
lip
which
you
can
see
on
any
canvas
of
an
old
dutch
master
wilhelminaberg
is
not
a
show
place
few
tourists
find
their
way
there
and
it
is
never
flooded
by
a
wave
of
strangers
but
if
some
of
the
stage
effects
are
lacking
it
is
more
interesting
for
that
reason
starr
was
captivated
with
the
cows
part
of
the
house
divided
from
their
human
companions
only
by
a
door
he
whipped
out
the
and
small
box
of
colors
which
he
always
carries
and
began
jotting
down
impressions
a
dash
of
red
for
the
painted
brick
walls
and
of
green
for
the
mangers
a
yellow
blur
for
the
rays
of
sunshine
streaming
through
the
cows
windows
and
on
the
adorning
their
a
trifle
more
elaboration
for
the
carpet
of
sawdust
stamped
with
an
ornamental
pattern
and
the
quaint
design
of
the
for
the
stablemen
in
the
wall
opposite
a
streak
here
and
there
for
the
cords
which
loop
the
cows
tails
to
nails
in
the
ceiling
gorgeous
spots
of
crimson
and
yellow
for
the
piled
cheeses
and
in
the
adjoining
room
the
while
our
guide
described
in
creditable
english
the
process
of
starr
sketched
him
standing
before
his
big
blue
press
printing
out
his
molds
with
an
odd
yellow
reflection
from
the
cheese
cannonballs
heaped
on
trays
shining
up
into
the
shrewd
dutch
face
then
in
came
the
young
wife
with
a
child
or
two
pretty
dark
creatures
like
their
mother
with
the
innocent
brown
eyes
of
calves
followed
by
grandmama
in
her
gold
helmet
to
say
that
our
meal
was
ready
and
starr
induced
them
to
stand
for
him
though
they
were
reluctant
and
and
it
was
by
sheer
fascination
that
he
prevailed
illustration
induced
them
to
stand
for
him
though
they
were
reluctant
and
never
had
any
of
the
party
except
myself
seen
a
room
like
that
to
which
we
were
summoned
for
luncheon
and
starr
could
not
eat
until
he
had
said
in
a
few
words
of
paint
what
he
thought
of
its
paneled
walls
its
shelves
littered
with
quaint
and
foolish
china
ostrich
eggs
shells
model
ships
and
toys
its
ancient
chests
of
drawers
its
extraordinary
fireplace
and
best
of
all
its
one
for
grandmama
with
a
kind
of
trapeze
arrangement
to
help
her
rise
one
for
papa
and
mama
with
an
inner
shelf
like
a
nest
for
baby
and
one
with
a
fence
for
a
parcel
of
children
the
artist
grew
cold
while
he
worked
but
it
was
worth
the
sacrifice
for
the
result
was
excellent
and
nell
admiration
gave
me
i
ashamed
to
say
a
qualm
of
jealousy
i
have
no
such
accomplishments
with
which
to
win
her
we
sat
in
high
chairs
with
pictures
of
ships
painted
on
backs
and
arms
while
we
lunched
off
plates
drank
delicious
coffee
out
of
cups
with
feet
and
stirred
it
with
antique
silver
spoons
small
enough
for
children
playthings
afterwards
the
old
lady
with
the
helmet
and
the
pretty
were
persuaded
to
show
their
winter
wardrobes
which
consisted
mostly
of
petticoats
there
were
dozens
some
knitted
of
heavy
wool
some
quilted
in
elaborate
patterns
and
some
of
thick
fleecy
cloth
but
there
was
not
one
weighing
less
than
three
pounds
do
ask
how
many
they
wear
at
a
time
the
chaperon
commanded
no
doubt
with
a
thought
for
her
mysterious
about
which
i
often
wonder
i
wear
eight
summer
and
winter
replied
the
old
lady
my
is
of
the
younger
generation
and
does
not
put
on
more
than
six
little
maria
is
allowed
only
four
it
is
better
for
children
not
to
carry
much
weight
the
girls
looked
petrified
what
martyrdom
exclaimed
nell
even
the
duke
of
alva
could
have
subjected
dutch
women
to
much
worse
torture
than
that
eight
of
these
knitted
and
wadded
petticoats
in
summer
being
buried
alive
up
to
the
waist
in
the
name
of
civilization
do
they
do
it
i
passed
on
the
question
to
the
old
lady
she
and
her
received
it
gravely
thought
it
over
for
a
moment
and
then
replied
but
we
must
do
it
mynheer
it
is
the
mode
it
has
always
been
the
mode
talk
of
slaves
of
fashion
muttered
nell
if
you
want
to
find
them
do
look
in
london
or
paris
or
new
york
but
among
the
peasantry
of
holland
not
one
of
the
three
could
recover
from
the
shock
they
seemed
stunned
as
if
all
the
petticoats
at
once
had
fallen
from
the
shelves
onto
their
heads
and
overwhelmed
them
and
even
when
we
had
said
to
wilhelminaberg
they
talked
in
hushed
tones
of
what
it
must
feel
like
to
be
clothed
in
eight
petticoats
they
would
probably
have
gone
on
discussing
the
subject
in
all
its
phases
until
we
regained
the
boat
if
something
had
not
happened
it
was
just
after
we
passed
the
bandstand
in
the
meer
and
starr
had
wondered
aloud
if
the
inhabitants
of
broek
ever
did
revel
so
giddily
and
publicly
as
to
come
outside
their
gardens
to
hear
music
when
there
was
a
loud
splash
followed
by
a
cry
the
splash
was
tibe
the
cry
his
mistress
and
in
an
instant
we
were
in
a
flutter
for
the
dog
was
in
the
lake
close
to
shore
the
water
is
coated
over
with
mingling
with
a
bright
green
beady
vegetation
and
tibe
mistook
it
for
a
meadow
standing
at
a
considerable
elevation
on
the
road
above
he
leaped
down
with
happy
confidence
only
to
be
deceived
as
many
wiser
than
he
have
been
by
appearances
bulldogs
have
virtues
all
their
own
but
they
are
not
spaniels
and
there
was
despair
in
tibe
brown
eyes
as
he
threw
one
last
look
of
appeal
at
his
friends
before
disappearing
under
the
green
carpet
up
he
came
in
a
second
covered
with
green
beads
his
black
mouth
choked
with
them
although
not
a
instinct
kept
him
afloat
and
he
began
to
swim
awkwardly
forging
farther
from
shore
instead
of
nearer
in
a
moment
he
had
tangled
his
legs
among
ropey
stems
of
and
frightened
and
confused
at
finding
himself
a
prisoner
went
down
again
under
the
green
surface
meanwhile
his
mistress
was
half
mad
with
fright
and
would
not
listen
to
starr
assurance
that
the
dog
was
in
no
danger
he
bob
up
serenely
and
swim
close
to
us
then
i
hook
my
stick
in
his
collar
and
pull
him
out
the
mariner
said
cheerfully
but
she
pushed
him
away
sobbing
now
i
never
could
bear
to
see
a
woman
cry
even
a
woman
in
blue
spectacles
so
i
did
not
wait
for
tibe
to
come
up
and
recover
presence
of
mind
as
he
probably
would
but
splashed
down
myself
onto
the
green
carpet
the
water
hardly
reached
to
my
hips
so
there
was
no
bravery
in
the
feat
and
i
felt
a
fool
as
i
went
wading
out
to
the
spot
where
by
this
time
the
dog
head
had
again
appeared
among
the
pads
the
living
image
of
a
gargoyle
but
as
i
hauled
him
out
with
a
word
of
encouragement
the
poor
chap
gratitude
repaid
me
looking
like
a
statue
of
a
dog
he
licked
such
portions
of
me
as
he
could
reach
with
a
green
tongue
and
blessed
me
with
his
beautiful
eyes
when
i
had
him
on
we
both
shook
ourselves
sending
an
emerald
spray
flying
in
all
directions
and
then
abortive
attempts
were
made
to
dry
tibe
with
the
handkerchiefs
of
the
united
party
a
few
hurried
thank
you
were
all
i
got
from
the
chaperon
at
the
time
but
on
board
lorelei
she
had
something
more
to
say
before
starting
i
had
to
go
to
my
stateroom
on
waterspin
to
change
wet
clothes
for
dry
ones
and
when
i
was
ready
to
take
up
my
part
of
skipper
no
one
was
on
deck
save
the
chaperon
and
tibe
a
subdued
tibe
buttoned
up
in
a
child
cape
which
his
mistress
insisted
on
buying
in
amsterdam
for
him
to
wear
in
cold
weather
my
poor
darling
spattered
the
girls
so
much
that
they
below
taking
off
their
frocks
she
explained
starr
changing
too
i
think
but
i
waited
to
speak
to
you
alone
although
i
am
a
i
have
something
particular
to
say
i
looked
a
question
and
she
went
on
i
always
liked
you
from
the
first
i
saw
you
were
the
kind
of
man
who
could
be
trusted
never
to
injure
a
woman
no
matter
what
your
opinion
of
her
might
be
and
have
done
you
a
good
turn
if
it
had
come
in
my
way
but
now
after
what
i
owe
you
this
afternoon
i
ready
to
go
of
my
way
you
think
i
an
interfering
she
hesitated
a
moment
old
thing
if
i
say
i
can
guess
why
you
are
skipper
why
you
on
this
trip
at
all
now
if
you
wanted
to
be
disagreeable
i
expect
you
could
say
that
you
why
i
on
board
but
i
do
believe
you
do
want
to
be
disagreeable
do
you
certainly
not
said
i
laughing
and
even
if
i
did
there
an
old
proverb
which
forbids
the
pot
to
call
the
kettle
black
oh
you
and
i
and
my
dear
nephew
ronny
are
pots
and
kettles
together
the
three
of
us
but
our
are
all
right
and
talking
of
hearts
leads
up
to
what
i
want
to
say
about
my
job
as
skipper
yes
you
say
you
can
guess
why
i
took
it
my
idea
is
that
you
guessed
the
first
day
on
board
why
of
i
did
i
saw
which
one
of
the
girls
it
was
too
and
noticed
that
something
had
gone
wrong
that
interested
me
for
observant
you
chiel
amang
us
takkin
notes
think
of
a
dutchman
quoting
that
however
even
peasants
in
holland
break
into
english
and
german
why
should
a
jonkheer
spout
burns
but
let
me
get
to
my
point
i
have
found
out
what
the
trouble
is
but
i
know
you
must
have
sinned
against
the
girl
in
some
way
or
done
something
tactless
which
is
worse
and
made
her
angry
or
else
she
felt
it
was
her
to
be
angry
and
has
been
living
up
to
it
ever
since
talk
of
the
of
a
man
with
a
maid
the
way
of
a
maid
with
a
man
is
funnier
and
more
subtle
nell
van
buren
is
an
adorable
girl
but
the
more
adorable
a
girl
is
the
more
horried
she
can
be
that
subtle
why
of
course
what
else
should
it
be
and
the
whole
thing
been
as
good
as
a
play
to
watch
i
wished
you
well
from
the
beginning
but
i
thought
you
capable
of
taking
care
of
yourself
and
now
you
changed
your
mind
i
have
since
yesterday
i
sure
something
happened
at
amsterdam
in
the
morning
she
was
so
different
what
did
you
do
to
her
i
bullied
her
a
little
i
said
i
as
much
how
could
you
i
believed
it
would
be
good
for
her
so
it
was
but
it
was
good
for
you
she
has
been
angelic
since
that
the
poor
man
you
could
see
it
i
was
rather
encouraged
though
it
seemed
too
delightful
to
be
true
i
admitted
men
are
blind
especially
when
they
in
love
you
understand
better
than
you
do
girls
i
dare
say
i
said
meekly
she
so
nice
to
you
because
she
means
to
punish
you
for
humbling
her
pride
i
warning
you
as
a
reward
for
saving
my
treasured
lamb
if
tibe
had
fallen
into
the
water
and
you
had
pulled
him
out
perhaps
i
have
left
you
to
founder
and
watched
the
fun
but
now
i
say
take
care
she
dangerous
how
can
you
tell
i
asked
how
can
i
tell
because
i
a
woman
of
course
and
because
i
should
act
just
the
same
if
i
were
young
well
if
you
right
what
am
i
to
do
that
what
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
you
must
pretend
to
be
tired
of
her
good
heavens
she
must
see
that
she
has
any
power
over
you
she
cares
for
you
more
than
she
lets
herself
think
i
wish
to
goodness
i
could
believe
that
there
no
use
in
your
believing
it
the
thing
is
to
make
believe
it
make
her
find
it
out
with
a
shock
and
there
only
one
way
of
doing
that
what
rouse
her
to
jealousy
i
laughed
bitterly
tell
me
to
get
her
the
moon
flirt
with
miss
rivers
my
dear
madam
you
proved
to
me
that
i
a
fool
but
i
neither
cad
nor
hypocrite
dear
me
if
the
way
you
going
to
take
it
you
lost
our
dear
ronny
will
snatch
her
from
under
your
nose
although
she
is
a
bit
in
love
with
him
and
with
you
if
you
consent
to
shake
her
up
a
little
starr
is
in
love
with
them
both
he
was
or
rather
he
was
in
love
with
being
in
love
but
because
you
want
miss
van
buren
out
of
pure
contrariness
he
thinks
now
that
he
wants
her
beware
of
her
kindness
if
you
should
be
deluded
by
it
into
proposing
she
send
you
about
your
business
and
perhaps
accept
the
other
man
because
she
was
wretched
and
did
quite
realize
what
was
the
matter
you
a
gloomy
prophetess
i
said
miserably
you
wo
take
my
advice
no
i
ca
do
that
i
must
do
the
best
i
can
for
myself
in
some
other
way
there
is
any
other
i
shall
try
well
promise
me
you
wo
propose
for
a
fortnight
anyhow
or
until
i
give
you
leave
we
all
always
do
whatever
you
wish
us
to
extraordinary
lady
i
wonder
why
you
must
go
on
wondering
but
in
the
meantime
i
will
you
will
try
to
save
you
as
you
saved

the
mariner
was
restless
when
we
landed
at
the
strange
town
of
monnikendam
and
had
the
air
or
i
imagined
it
of
expecting
something
as
we
walked
through
the
wide
hoog
straat
he
glanced
at
the
rows
of
beautiful
seventeenth
century
houses
as
if
he
feared
to
see
sir
alec
macnairne
spring
from
behind
some
ornamented
ancient
door
to
accuse
him
as
a
perjured
villain
even
the
exquisite
church
tower
which
has
the
semblance
of
holding
aloft
a
carved
goblet
of
old
silver
did
not
appeal
to
him
as
it
would
if
he
had
not
been
preoccupied
and
instead
of
laughing
at
the
crowds
of
children
who
clattered
after
us
waking
the
clean
and
quiet
streets
with
the
ring
of
sabots
he
let
them
get
upon
his
nerves
the
girls
were
amused
however
and
said
that
the
little
pestering
voices
babbling
broken
english
without
sense
or
sequence
were
like
the
voices
of
the
story
in
the
arabian
nights
haunting
voices
which
tempted
you
to
turn
round
although
you
had
been
warned
beforehand
that
if
you
did
you
would
lose
your
human
form
and
become
a
stone
tibe
was
the
real
attraction
a
sadder
and
wiser
tibe
than
the
tibe
of
an
hour
ago
so
sad
and
so
wise
that
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
insist
upon
a
friendship
with
three
kids
which
joined
the
procession
of
his
admirers
starr
walked
beside
his
aunt
as
if
to
protect
her
in
case
of
need
and
once
or
twice
when
i
tried
to
attract
their
attention
to
some
notable
façade
or
doorway
they
were
absorbed
in
conversation
and
might
as
well
have
been
in
new
york
as
in
monnikendam
on
the
zuider
zee
when
i
had
shown
the
party
what
i
thought
best
worth
seeing
i
had
to
leave
them
to
their
own
resources
and
go
alone
to
the
boat
hendrik
could
not
navigate
lorelei
and
her
companion
through
the
series
of
locks
by
which
the
canal
pours
its
soul
into
the
heart
of
the
zuider
zee
it
took
me
half
an
hour
to
do
it
and
when
i
had
brought
the
two
craft
to
the
last
of
the
the
four
people
and
the
one
dog
were
waiting
for
me
the
most
persistent
of
the
children
hovering
in
the
distance
it
a
bigger
town
than
but
not
as
interesting
said
the
chaperon
looking
back
disparagingly
in
the
direction
of
monnikendam
nor
as
clean
i
saw
five
bits
of
paper
in
as
many
streets
and
a
woman
we
met
did
appear
at
all
inclined
to
commit
suicide
because
she
desecrated
the
pavement
by
upsetting
a
pail
of
milk
whereas
in
broek
she
have
been
hauled
off
to
prison
each
house
in
broek
looked
like
a
model
in
jewelry
and
the
whole
effect
was
like
a
cut
in
pasteboard
but
the
monnikendam
houses
are
big
enough
for
people
to
lie
out
straight
in
when
they
go
to
bed
which
seems
quite
commonplace
except
for
that
church
tower
and
a
few
doorways
and
the
wonderful
costumes
and
the
where
they
sell
nothing
but
sabots
i
do
see
why
we
bothered
to
stop
at
monnikendam
i
thought
you
were
keen
to
visit
the
dead
cities
of
the
zuider
zee
said
i
she
stared
at
me
as
blankly
as
if
she
had
not
been
prophesying
my
doom
a
little
while
ago
what
that
got
to
do
with
monnikendam
she
demanded
only
that
monnikendam
one
of
the
dead
cities
your
first
i
explained
but
she
cried
incredulously
monnikendam
a
dead
city
of
the
zuider
zee
it
is
true
i
afraid
it
is
oh
then
i
disappointed
i
thought
we
should
come
to
the
dead
cities
along
the
shore
of
the
sea
that
we
see
streets
lined
with
empty
houses
fallen
half
to
pieces
and
that
perhaps
if
the
water
were
clear
we
could
look
down
down
and
spy
steeples
and
ruined
castles
glimmering
at
the
bottom
wo
some
be
like
that
not
one
i
said
they
wo
be
any
deader
than
monnikendam
which
was
once
the
playground
of
merchant
princes
i
thought
it
was
dead
enough
not
to
please
me
she
answered
with
the
air
of
a
madame
defarge
in
blue
spectacles
the
mariner
came
up
before
we
had
got
into
open
sea
for
the
moment
the
three
ladies
were
occupied
in
watching
tibe
who
had
fallen
asleep
in
his
cape
and
was
running
with
all
his
feet
in
some
wild
dream
flickering
in
every
muscle
and
wrinkling
his
black
mug
into
alarming
grimaces
look
here
said
starr
cautiously
do
you
think
we
can
paint
out
the
name
of
when
we
get
to
volendam
or
must
we
engage
a
man
to
do
it
of
course
if
we
could
it
would
cause
less
remark
especially
if
we
did
the
job
in
the
evening
or
early
morning
what
you
took
that
idea
of
mine
seriously
i
asked
certainly
it
was
a
brilliant
one
i
doubt
if
miss
van
buren
would
consent
said
i
she
has
already
by
jove
what
excuse
did
you
make
for
asking
her
i
did
ask
her
what
i
did
was
to
put
the
notion
into
darling
auntie
head
i
knew
after
that
the
thing
was
as
good
as
done
i
remarked
in
my
vaguest
way
that
it
was
a
wonder
some
catastrophe
happened
to
tibe
or
other
less
important
members
of
the
party
on
board
a
boat
named
i
did
exactly
it
was
an
unlucky
name
but
somehow
or
other
she
seemed
to
think
so
at
the
end
of
our
conversation
then
she
had
a
conversation
with
miss
van
buren
and
the
consequence
is
that
the
sooner
name
is
changed
to
the
better
the
owner
will
be
pleased
and
no
questions
asked
by
jove
said
i
again
there
something
uncanny
about
the
adopted
relative
i
would
give
a
good
deal
to
know
what
she
planning
to
do
for
me
for
if
she
has
decided
that
my
name
had
better
be
painted
on
or
off
any
heart
of
her
acquaintance
i
have
little
doubt
it
will
be
once
out
of
the
sluice
we
were
immediately
in
the
zuider
zee
whose
yellow
waves
rocked
lorelei
as
if
she
were
a
cradle
causing
the
barge
to
wallow
heavily
in
our
wake
should
the
weather
be
rough
at
any
time
when
we
have
seaports
to
visit
lorelei
and
her
consort
will
have
to
lie
in
harbor
and
the
party
must
be
satisfied
to
do
the
journey
on
a
commonplace
but
on
such
a
day
as
this
there
was
no
danger
no
excuse
for
seasickness
although
i
half
expected
the
ladies
to
ask
if
we
were
safe
apparently
however
the
doubt
did
not
enter
their
heads
so
far
we
have
had
neither
accident
nor
stoppage
of
any
kind
and
they
have
ceased
to
think
it
possible
that
anything
can
happen
to
the
motor
marken
with
its
church
soon
appeared
to
our
eyes
the
closely
grouped
little
seeming
to
float
on
the
waves
as
san
giorgio
maggiore
does
at
venice
in
the
sunset
hour
in
spite
of
my
sneers
at
the
island
theater
and
its
performers
eagerness
betrayed
itself
in
the
manner
of
my
passengers
as
we
approached
marken
full
petrol
ahead
they
see
us
i
announced
as
we
drew
near
enough
to
make
out
that
a
crowd
of
huge
green
and
yellow
mounds
massed
in
the
harbor
were
they
congratulating
themselves
on
an
unexpected
harvest
as
the
big
audiences
for
which
they
cater
every
morning
and
afternoon
in
summer
are
gone
for
the
day
when
we
arrive
there
be
a
and
a
which
would
make
a
for
a
first
act
in
london
still
nearer
we
came
and
now
we
could
see
men
and
women
and
little
children
playing
at
unloading
the
hay
with
pitchforks
from
boats
large
and
small
it
was
the
prettiest
sight
imaginable
and
one
felt
that
there
ought
to
be
an
accompaniment
of
light
music
from
a
hidden
orchestra
the
men
were
dressed
in
black
and
dark
blue
jerseys
or
long
jackets
with
silver
buttons
and
enormously
loose
trousers
each
leg
of
which
gave
the
effect
of
a
balloon
at
their
brown
throats
glittered
knobs
of
silver
or
gold
and
there
was
another
of
precious
metal
at
the
waist
their
hair
was
cut
straight
across
the
forehead
over
the
ears
and
at
the
back
of
the
neck
as
if
the
barber
had
clapped
on
a
bowl
and
trimmed
round
it
and
from
under
the
brims
of
impudent
looking
caps
glowed
narrow
defiant
blue
eyes
but
though
the
men
are
well
enough
as
pictures
it
is
the
women
and
children
of
marken
who
have
made
the
fortune
of
the
little
island
as
a
show
place
and
they
were
at
their
best
raking
the
golden
hay
their
yellow
hair
their
brilliant
complexions
and
still
more
brilliant
costumes
dazzling
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
we
landed
and
nobody
appeared
to
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
us
that
is
part
of
the
daily
play
but
i
was
the
only
one
who
knew
this
and
seeing
these
charming
wonderful
creatures
peacefully
pursuing
their
pastoral
occupations
as
if
there
were
no
stranger
eyes
to
stare
i
was
reproached
for
my
base
insinuations
how
could
you
call
them
cried
phyllis
loves
darlings
i
could
kiss
every
one
of
them
they
have
the
most
angelic
faces
and
the
children
why
they
it
was
true
the
picture
was
idyllic
if
slightly
sensational
in
coloring
there
was
scarcely
a
woman
who
was
not
pretty
and
a
female
thing
must
be
plain
indeed
not
to
look
charming
in
the
gorgeous
costume
of
marken
the
complexions
the
eyes
the
golden
fringe
and
two
long
yellow
curls
one
on
either
side
the
face
falling
to
the
breast
from
under
mob
caps
covered
with
lace
the
short
very
full
blue
and
black
skirts
the
richly
embroidered
bodices
brilliant
as
the
breast
of
a
parrot
the
filmy
fichus
and
white
sleeves
the
black
sabots
with
painted
wreaths
of
roses
turned
the
little
harbor
of
marken
into
a
rare
the
expressions
of
the
fair
faces
were
beautifully
mild
also
and
it
was
not
strange
to
hear
miss
rivers
pronounce
the
women
angels
and
the
children
cherubs
the
group
at
the
formed
the
chorus
but
we
had
not
been
on
land
for
many
minutes
before
the
principal
characters
in
the
play
began
to
appear
a
young
girl
who
might
be
called
the
leading
lady
came
tripping
down
to
the
harbor
with
a
tiny
child
hanging
to
each
hand
all
three
were
apparently
dressed
alike
in
rich
embroideries
and
full
skirts
to
their
ankles
worn
over
an
incredible
number
of
petticoats
but
i
could
tell
by
a
small
rosette
on
the
cap
of
the
middle
child
that
it
was
a
boy
the
trio
approached
smiling
seraphically
and
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
three
ladies
began
petting
the
two
fantastic
babes
how
do
you
do
you
like
see
inside
a
marken
house
asked
the
pretty
girl
speaking
english
with
the
voice
of
a
young
siren
they
all
answered
that
they
would
be
delighted
i
show
my
home
you
come
with
me
starr
and
i
were
bidden
to
follow
and
i
would
not
spoil
sport
by
letting
it
be
known
to
the
actress
that
one
member
of
the
audience
was
a
dutchman
the
charming
creature
with
her
two
bobbing
golden
curls
was
knitting
a
stocking
almost
as
long
as
her
little
brother
and
as
she
turned
to
show
the
way
she
never
for
an
instant
ceased
work
toiling
after
her
we
walked
along
the
dyke
where
the
fishermen
houses
stand
in
flows
hoisted
on
poles
like
storks
nests
out
of
the
reach
of
inundations
needles
glittering
our
guide
led
us
to
the
foot
of
a
steep
flight
of
steps
belonging
to
a
house
like
all
the
other
houses
so
much
like
that
it
would
seem
we
were
being
ushered
into
an
ordinary
specimen
of
a
dwelling
but
i
knew
better
now
the
scene
changed
the
first
was
marken
harbor
with
the
for
the
second
act
we
had
the
interior
of
the
honest
fisherman
cottage
and
what
an
interior
it
was
in
all
europe
there
is
no
such
place
as
marken
no
such
dresses
no
such
golden
curls
no
such
rooms
as
these
into
which
a
coquettishly
capped
mother
with
a
marvelous
doll
of
a
baby
in
her
arms
was
sweetly
inviting
us
only
think
of
these
living
in
such
wonderful
little
of
houses
exclaimed
phyllis
to
be
echoed
by
murmurs
of
admiration
from
the
others
but
i
said
nothing
and
it
really
was
like
wandering
into
a
fairy
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
any
other
house
resembling
this
unless
that
of
silverhair
three
bears
the
polished
green
walls
were
almost
hidden
with
brightly
colored
dutch
placks
and
shelves
covered
with
little
useless
ornaments
the
chairs
were
yellow
with
roses
painted
over
them
and
varnished
till
they
twinkled
the
family
beds
in
the
wall
had
white
curtains
as
crisp
as
new
banknotes
and
white
knitted
coverlets
with
ruffles
but
as
the
green
doors
of
the
beds
were
kept
shut
for
the
day
you
would
not
have
suspected
the
elegance
within
had
not
the
siren
opened
them
for
inspection
under
the
door
of
each
bed
was
placed
a
little
red
bench
festooned
with
painted
flowers
and
as
there
were
nine
in
the
family
and
only
four
beds
counting
the
little
one
underneath
for
the
babies
the
disposition
of
forces
at
night
did
not
bear
thinking
of
all
the
tables
had
crocheted
white
covers
and
were
decked
with
vases
and
fresh
flowers
glittering
brass
and
pewter
things
and
gay
old
china
but
it
was
the
next
room
a
small
one
adjoining
the
big
which
roused
the
highest
admiration
there
was
not
much
furniture
but
up
to
the
low
ceiling
the
walls
were
concealed
by
shelves
laden
with
gorgeously
painted
wooden
boxes
little
and
big
they
were
of
all
colors
and
all
brightly
varnished
some
were
plain
blue
or
green
or
crimson
others
had
dutch
or
japanese
scenery
painted
on
their
sides
and
the
largest
could
not
have
been
more
than
a
foot
and
a
half
long
by
eight
inches
in
height
this
must
be
where
they
keep
their
cake
and
bread
and
kitchen
stores
said
miss
rivers
but
with
a
smile
the
siren
began
to
open
the
boxes
instead
of
sugar
and
spices
they
contained
the
family
wardrobe
folded
in
great
variety
little
embroidered
jackets
for
the
children
caps
bodices
and
even
in
the
largest
boxes
petticoats
the
ladies
and
starr
also
were
charmed
with
everything
especially
the
dark
secretive
loft
as
full
of
suspended
fishing
nets
as
closet
was
of
wives
they
had
never
seen
such
a
distracting
place
as
marken
or
such
kind
and
pretty
people
it
was
nearly
an
hour
before
it
occurred
to
them
that
they
had
better
say
and
by
that
time
they
knew
the
whole
history
of
the
interesting
family
they
shook
hands
with
each
one
of
the
nine
including
the
baby
patted
the
cat
and
then
lingered
outside
taking
photographs
some
of
the
neighbors
young
women
and
girls
with
dimples
in
the
roses
of
their
cheeks
drew
nearer
as
if
lured
by
admiration
of
the
ladies
nell
and
phyllis
seeing
them
beckoned
and
the
fair
creatures
obeyed
the
summons
with
an
appearance
of
shyness
they
too
were
photographed
and
after
many
politenesses
had
been
exchanged
starr
came
to
ask
if
i
thought
the
dear
things
feelings
would
be
hurt
by
a
small
offering
of
money
they
may
and
probably
will
be
if
the
offering
is
small
said
i
dryly
what
are
you
insinuating
exclaimed
nell
meanwhile
the
siren
her
sisters
and
brothers
and
a
number
of
handsome
friends
of
her
own
age
pinned
wary
eyes
upon
us
the
dimples
were
in
abeyance
for
the
guileless
angels
guessed
the
subject
of
conversation
and
were
preparing
for
eventualities
i
do
think
they
refuse
money
i
said
in
fact
they
expect
it
how
much
ought
we
to
give
asked
starr
whatever
you
have
handy
and
whatever
you
think
it
worth
said
i
exploring
my
pockets
for
silver
i
suppose
the
family
would
be
delighted
with
the
gulden
suggested
phyllis
we
might
hand
one
child
another
to
divide
among
her
little
friends
and
buy
them
sweets
you
can
try
that
and
see
if
they
thank
you
i
replied
why
of
course
they
will
said
the
chaperon
it
easy
to
see
that
they
have
lovely
dispositions
except
the
little
boy
who
was
afraid
of
tibe
just
because
he
tried
in
play
to
bite
off
the
button
on
the
back
of
his
cap
i
stood
still
and
watched
the
others
reviewing
their
change
putting
their
bits
of
silver
together
to
make
up
the
sum
decided
upon
as
small
money
is
always
at
a
premium
i
did
not
add
my
mite
to
the
fund
for
i
knew
what
would
happen
in
the
end
finally
phyllis
was
chosen
as
emissary
for
the
party
again
she
said
sweetly
to
our
late
guide
here
something
for
your
little
brothers
and
sisters
to
remember
us
by
and
will
you
ask
your
companions
to
buy
themselves
some
sweets
with
the
rest
but
in
a
second
the
siren
was
transformed
into
a
harpy
her
blue
eyes
turned
to
steel
and
shot
lightning
the
children
understanding
the
situation
stood
by
looking
like
little
sharks
and
the
handsome
friends
suddenly
assumed
the
air
of
fierce
wild
birds
in
the
zoo
just
tame
enough
to
eat
out
of
your
hand
if
you
offer
what
they
like
but
hating
and
scorning
you
in
their
cold
hearts
the
things
ready
to
bite
your
finger
to
the
bone
should
you
tease
instead
of
feed
them
our
guide
held
up
a
hand
with
all
her
fingers
spread
out
five
five
she
demanded
shrilly
every
one
of
you
give
one
gulden
all
this
you
gave
is
to
my
friends
not
enough
for
me
i
have
more
i
have
more
one
gulden
every
person
nonsense
said
i
in
dutch
here
another
gulden
take
that
and
go
away
it
twice
too
much
for
you
i
flung
her
the
money
and
she
clutched
it
but
she
had
not
finished
with
us
yet
nor
had
the
others
surprised
and
horrified
at
the
sudden
change
in
the
pink
and
white
angels
the
ladies
turned
away
and
hurried
toward
the
boat
for
an
instant
the
creatures
were
abashed
by
my
knowledge
of
dutch
but
it
was
only
for
an
instant
the
mother
of
nine
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
green
bandbox
house
baby
in
arms
shrieked
encouragement
to
her
daughter
the
siren
clattered
after
us
with
angrily
ringing
sabots
raging
for
money
the
children
cried
the
friends
shouted
frank
criticisms
of
our
features
our
hats
our
manners
i
would
have
gone
away
without
rewarding
their
blackmail
with
another
penny
but
in
desperation
starr
turned
and
dashed
four
or
five
gulden
at
the
crowd
the
coins
rolled
and
the
bright
beings
swooped
more
than
ever
like
a
flock
of
gaudy
savage
birds
in
their
greed
thus
we
left
them
and
i
saw
that
the
ladies
were
thankful
to
be
safe
aboard
lorelei
again
fiends
gasped
the
chaperon
gazing
shoreward
in
a
kind
of
evil
fascination
and
we
called
them
angels
and
cherubs
i
think
you
are
good
jonkheer
not
to
say
told
you
so
they
terrible
beautiful
and
terrible
said
starr
like
figures
that
have
been
brought
to
life
and
have
sprung
at
you
out
of
a
picture
to
suck
your
blood
in
answer
to
some
wicked
wish
that
you
regret
the
minute
it
uttered
it
was
a
shock
to
be
undeceived
just
at
the
last
sighed
phyllis
my
nerves
are
quite
upset
i
shall
dream
of
them
said
nell
so
do
be
surprised
everybody
if
you
hear
screams
in
the
dark
hours
still
i
glad
we
went
i
would
have
missed
it
nor
i
added
the
chaperon
i
feel
as
if
we
paid
a
visit
to
some
village
of
the
orient
and
been
repulsed
by
savages
with
great
slaughter
and
i
was
going
to
mention
it
if
they
stayed
nice
it
would
have
seemed
so
but
did
you
notice
in
that
wonderful
little
waxwork
house
there
was
no
visible
place
to
they
do
wash
said
i
except
their
hands
and
faces
most
dutch
peasants
consider
bathing
a
dirty
habit
they
say
they
are
clean
and
so
of
course
they
do
need
to
bathe
that
makes
them
seem
more
like
birds
than
ever
exclaimed
nell
their
clothes
are
only
plumage
i
think
of
them
as
real
people
living
real
lives
it
true
marken
a
theater
three
thousand
meters
long
and
a
thousand
meters
wide
and
you
pay
the
actors
for
your
seats
the
harbor
itself
is
half
as
picturesque
as
spaakenberg
with
its
crowding
masts
and
brown
haze
of
but
the
people
are
worth
paying
for
tourists
like
ourselves
have
spoiled
them
they
were
genuine
once
i
said
probably
spaakenberg
which
is
so
unsophisticated
now
will
be
like
marken
one
day
and
even
at
volendam
though
the
people
have
kept
their
heads
which
shows
they
have
a
sense
of
humor
they
not
unaware
of
their
artistic
value
they
look
down
on
the
islanders
as
theatrical
but
it
partly
jealousy
marken
has
a
history
you
know
it
was
once
connected
with
the
mainland
but
that
was
as
long
ago
as
the
thirteenth
century
and
ever
since
the
inhabitants
have
prided
themselves
on
their
old
customs
and
costumes
they
proud
of
the
length
of
time
they
dared
to
be
protestant
and
no
marken
man
would
dream
of
crossing
to
papist
volendam
for
a
wife
though
volendam
celebrated
for
beautiful
girls
nor
would
any
of
the
tropical
birds
as
you
call
them
exchange
their
island
roost
for
the
mainland
although
marken
in
times
of
flood
is
a
most
uncomfortable
perch
and
the
birds
have
to
go
about
in
boats
but
here
we
come
to
volendam
and
you
be
able
to
make
up
your
mind
which
of
the
two
is
more
interesting
we
had
crossed
the
short
expanse
of
sea
and
passing
a
small
lighthouse
were
entering
a
square
harbor
lined
with
stoutly
built
solid
they
were
meant
for
stormy
weather
and
their
metal
pennons
which
could
never
droop
in
deadest
calm
flew
bravely
all
in
the
same
direction
like
flags
in
a
company
of
lances
in
an
old
froissart
picture
is
volendam
celebrated
for
tall
men
as
well
as
beautiful
girls
asked
nell
as
we
drew
near
enough
to
see
figures
moving
there
are
several
there
but
one
is
almost
the
tallest
man
i
ever
saw
except
my
cousin
robert
he
looks
singularly
like
your
cousin
robert
added
starr
not
too
joyously
i
think
it
your
cousin
robert
said
i
i
sure
it
is
your
cousin
robert
murmured
miss
rivers
but
why
is
your
cousin
robert
here
inquired
the
chaperon
could
he
have
known
you
were
coming
i
did
write
to
him
said
nell
i
did
said
i
nobody
else
spoke
but
miss
rivers
blushed
phyllis
rivers
point
of
view
xxi
i
wrote
to
van
buren
because
he
asked
me
to
he
never
approved
of
the
trip
and
he
said
that
he
would
be
much
obliged
if
i
drop
him
a
line
every
few
days
to
keep
him
from
worrying
about
nell
i
did
mention
the
conversation
to
her
as
she
would
be
sure
to
think
it
nonsense
since
he
lived
without
hearing
about
her
welfare
for
twenty
years
and
never
gave
himself
a
moment
anxiety
but
of
course
that
was
different
she
is
in
his
country
now
and
he
feels
in
a
way
responsible
for
her
as
if
he
were
a
guardian
only
he
ca
make
her
do
things
because
he
has
no
legal
rights
besides
he
is
young
not
more
than
five
or
six
years
older
than
she
is
but
i
wish
i
had
such
a
guardian
instead
of
going
against
his
advice
i
would
obey
and
even
ask
for
it
van
buren
is
the
wisest
young
man
i
ever
met
as
well
as
the
best
looking
and
i
am
vexed
with
nell
because
she
treats
him
as
if
he
were
a
big
to
make
up
for
her
ingratitude
i
afraid
it
amounts
to
that
i
have
tried
to
show
that
appreciate
his
kindness
as
engaged
i
can
be
nice
without
danger
of
his
fancying
that
i
flirting
and
the
poor
fellow
has
seemed
pleased
with
the
few
little
things
been
able
to
do
by
way
of
expressing
our
thanks
i
wish
i
could
believe
that
the
girl
he
going
to
marry
is
good
enough
for
him
but
she
is
plain
and
seems
to
have
rather
an
uncertain
temper
nell
says
she
is
a
little
cat
but
i
should
be
sorry
to
call
any
girl
such
a
name
though
i
known
many
cats
better
looking
and
more
agreeable
than
she
i
have
always
been
brought
up
to
think
it
rather
rude
to
send
postcards
unless
they
are
picture
ones
for
people
to
put
in
their
albums
and
of
course
it
would
be
silly
flooding
van
buren
with
pictures
of
places
he
has
seen
dozens
of
times
so
when
i
have
written
to
him
i
felt
obliged
to
write
regular
letters
i
meant
to
scribble
a
line
or
two
but
holland
is
so
fascinating
that
i
have
found
myself
running
on
about
it
and
van
buren
has
seemed
grateful
because
it
his
native
land
and
the
places
he
likes
best
have
turned
out
to
be
my
favorites
in
that
way
we
have
happened
to
write
each
other
quite
long
letters
almost
every
day
for
he
has
wanted
to
tell
me
i
must
be
sure
to
see
so
and
so
or
do
so
and
so
and
i
have
had
to
answer
that
i
have
seen
it
or
done
it
and
liked
it
as
much
as
he
thought
i
would
if
our
trip
could
be
improved
it
would
be
by
having
van
buren
with
us
but
naturally
that
impossible
as
he
a
man
of
affairs
and
freule
menela
van
der
windt
would
hardly
sympathize
with
his
kind
wish
to
take
care
of
his
cousin
if
he
carried
it
so
far
as
to
leave
her
for
any
length
of
time
simply
on
account
of
nell
as
it
is
his
letters
and
exchanging
ideas
with
him
have
been
a
pleasure
to
me
and
i
should
have
liked
to
share
it
with
nell
as
we
always
have
shared
everything
if
i
had
been
afraid
she
would
laugh
her
cousin
is
too
fine
a
fellow
to
be
laughed
at
so
i
have
protected
him
by
keeping
our
correspondence
to
myself
i
did
want
to
come
to
holland
as
it
seemed
such
a
terrifying
adventure
for
nell
and
me
to
rush
away
from
england
and
go
darting
about
in
a
and
so
horribly
extravagant
to
spend
all
the
money
poor
captain
noble
left
in
enjoying
ourselves
for
a
few
weeks
however
it
to
be
and
there
is
something
about
holland
which
appeals
to
me
more
than
i
dreamed
any
country
except
england
could
i
loved
it
almost
from
the
minute
we
landed
but
when
you
like
any
person
in
a
foreign
place
it
makes
you
like
the
place
itself
better
i
do
think
holland
is
the
most
complete
little
country
imaginable
while
you
are
in
it
it
feels
like
the
whole
world
because
you
appear
to
be
in
the
very
middle
of
the
world
and
when
you
look
over
the
wide
flat
spaces
you
think
that
your
eyes
reach
to
the
end
of
everything
and
then
all
you
see
is
so
characteristic
of
holland
even
the
sunrises
and
sunsets
nothing
that
you
find
in
holland
could
be
in
its
right
place
anywhere
else
on
earth
but
perhaps
one
can
hardly
say
that
holland
on
earth
now
i
got
to
know
the
hollow
land
as
jonkheer
brederode
often
calls
it
i
think
if
i
were
kidnapped
from
england
taken
up
in
a
balloon
and
dropped
down
here
even
in
a
town
i
never
seen
and
without
canals
i
should
say
the
minute
i
opened
my
eyes
and
found
my
breath
why
i
in
dear
little
holland
i
should
like
to
be
here
in
winter
van
buren
says
if
we
come
he
teach
me
to
skate
and
according
to
jonkheer
brederode
he
is
a
champion
skater
but
then
van
buren
told
me
the
same
thing
about
jonkheer
brederode
they
are
great
friends
and
talking
about
the
jonkheer
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
him
lately
i
believed
at
first
that
he
was
in
love
with
nell
and
had
got
himself
asked
on
board
lorelei
so
that
he
might
have
the
chance
of
knowing
her
better
she
had
the
same
impression
i
think
though
she
never
said
so
to
me
and
she
was
very
angry
about
something
freule
menela
told
us
it
seems
there
was
a
bet
i
do
know
exactly
about
what
except
that
nell
was
concerned
in
it
and
van
buren
mentioned
it
to
his
fiancée
she
ought
to
have
repeated
it
to
us
but
she
did
and
gave
the
impression
that
jonkheer
brederode
was
a
tremendous
flirt
who
fancied
himself
irresistible
with
women
she
warned
us
both
that
if
he
won
his
bet
and
contrived
to
meet
us
again
we
were
to
be
carried
away
by
any
signs
of
admiration
on
his
part
for
it
was
just
his
way
and
he
would
be
too
pleased
if
we
showed
ourselves
flattered
this
made
nell
and
she
said
that
in
her
opinion
jonkheer
brederode
ought
to
be
flattered
if
we
were
in
the
least
nice
to
him
but
she
for
one
did
intend
to
be
i
was
a
little
prejudiced
against
him
too
although
i
admired
him
very
much
when
i
saw
him
in
the
prinzenhof
at
delft
and
afterwards
at
the
i
thought
nell
might
in
any
case
be
grateful
to
him
for
saving
her
when
the
horse
ran
away
with
her
into
the
sea
i
did
tell
van
buren
what
freule
menela
said
for
it
would
have
been
mean
as
he
might
have
felt
vexed
with
her
but
for
his
sake
as
jonkheer
brederode
is
such
a
hero
in
his
eyes
i
determined
if
ever
we
saw
the
jonkheer
again
i
would
judge
him
too
severely
and
would
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
as
long
as
i
could
it
was
a
surprise
though
to
find
that
he
was
the
friend
starr
had
got
as
skipper
when
the
real
skipper
the
professional
one
failed
at
the
last
moment
naturally
i
remembered
instantly
about
the
bet
which
somehow
concerned
his
being
introduced
to
nell
within
a
certain
length
of
time
so
freule
menela
said
and
i
could
help
thinking
it
was
impertinent
winning
it
in
such
a
way
on
nell
own
boat
however
nell
was
so
horrid
to
him
from
the
first
minute
i
grew
sorry
for
the
poor
fellow
and
he
took
her
snubs
like
a
combination
of
saint
and
gentleman
the
more
i
saw
of
him
the
more
i
began
to
feel
that
freule
menela
van
der
windt
must
have
done
him
an
injustice
at
least
in
some
of
the
things
she
told
us
i
try
to
keep
watch
over
my
temper
always
and
i
hope
it
is
too
bad
yet
i
certain
that
in
jonkheer
brederode
place
i
could
have
endured
nell
behavior
but
would
have
stopped
being
skipper
the
second
day
out
even
if
i
left
a
whole
party
of
inoffensive
people
stranded
instead
of
leaving
us
in
the
lurch
after
undertaking
to
act
as
skipper
however
he
has
worked
for
us
like
a
trojan
not
only
has
he
been
skipper
but
guide
philosopher
and
friend
to
say
nothing
of
chauffeur
on
shore
and
general
provider
of
carriages
flowers
and
fruit
on
board
the
boat
the
trip
would
have
been
comparatively
tame
if
it
had
been
for
him
as
none
of
the
rest
of
us
know
anything
about
holland
and
he
knows
everything
no
trouble
has
seemed
too
much
for
him
if
it
could
add
in
any
way
to
our
happiness
and
i
thought
it
was
all
for
nell
he
looked
at
her
so
wistfully
sometimes
and
such
a
dark
red
came
up
to
his
forehead
when
she
said
anything
particularly
sarcastic
or
snubbing
that
even
if
he
deserved
it
i
could
bear
to
see
him
treated
so
while
he
was
doing
everything
for
our
pleasure
so
i
tried
to
be
nice
to
him
just
as
i
have
to
van
buren
and
oddly
enough
both
times
with
the
same
motive
to
make
up
for
nell
naughtiness
i
could
see
that
the
jonkheer
was
grateful
and
liked
me
a
little
but
the
night
van
buren
met
us
at
volendam
so
unexpectedly
lady
macnairne
gave
nell
and
me
both
quite
a
shock
she
said
she
had
it
on
very
that
it
was
entirely
a
mistake
about
jonkheer
brederode
being
in
love
with
nell
perhaps
he
had
wished
to
blind
people
by
making
them
think
so
but
it
was
really
for
sake
he
had
suggested
to
his
friend
starr
that
he
should
be
skipper
of
lorelei
i
wo
go
so
far
as
to
say
lady
macnairne
went
on
that
actually
in
love
with
phyllis
she
calls
us
phyllis
and
nell
now
but
he
was
so
much
taken
that
he
wished
to
make
her
acquaintance
at
present
it
entirely
rests
with
phyllis
whether
he
goes
on
to
fall
in
love
or
stops
at
admiration
she
said
this
before
nell
and
although
nell
has
behaved
so
hatefully
to
him
except
for
the
last
three
or
four
days
when
she
has
been
nicer
she
did
look
as
much
relieved
as
i
should
in
her
place
she
went
very
pink
and
then
very
pale
with
anger
at
lady
macnairne
for
talking
on
such
a
subject
she
explained
afterwards
but
at
the
time
she
show
any
resentment
against
lady
macnairne
she
only
laughed
and
said
dear
me
how
interesting
what
shall
you
do
about
it
phil
i
shall
show
him
that
i
am
i
answered
decidedly
i
like
and
admire
him
and
i
hope
i
shall
keep
his
friendship
always
that
a
pretty
beginning
to
what
may
be
a
pretty
romance
is
it
tibe
darling
asked
lady
macnairne
i
tried
not
to
blush
but
usually
the
more
you
try
not
to
blush
the
more
you
do
it
was
so
with
me
then
just
as
it
was
when
we
were
coming
into
harbor
at
volendam
and
everybody
said
to
nell
there
is
your
cousin
robert
or
why
is
your
cousin
robert
here
i
was
glad
to
stoop
down
and
pat
tibe
who
is
the
nicest
dog
i
ever
knew
it
true
as
nell
says
he
is
geared
ridiculously
low
and
having
such
a
short
nose
and
stick
out
lower
jaw
when
he
wants
to
eat
or
smell
things
he
has
practically
to
stand
on
his
head
also
he
can
never
see
anything
that
goes
on
under
his
chin
she
says
too
that
when
he
troubled
and
a
lot
of
lines
meet
together
at
one
point
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
his
face
looks
exactly
like
clapham
junction
and
so
it
does
nevertheless
he
beautiful
and
has
the
sort
of
features
old
masters
gave
dogs
in
pictures
features
more
like
those
of
people
than
animals
and
a
human
expression
in
the
eyes
illustration
was
glad
to
stoop
down
and
pat
it
is
odd
nell
and
i
used
to
tell
each
other
every
thought
we
had
and
we
talked
over
all
the
people
we
knew
but
now
though
i
think
a
good
deal
about
jonkheer
brederode
and
wonder
how
he
really
does
feel
toward
us
both
i
never
speak
about
him
to
nell
when
i
can
avoid
it
and
she
never
mentions
his
name
to
me
i
do
know
what
happened
to
make
her
suddenly
nice
to
him
at
amsterdam
but
something
did
and
she
is
nice
still
only
her
manner
is
different
somehow
i
can
hardly
tell
what
the
difference
is
but
it
is
there
at
first
when
we
went
to
spaakenberg
and
the
other
places
before
lady
macnairne
said
that
thing
she
was
agreeable
to
the
jonkheer
in
a
brilliant
bewitching
coquettish
sort
of
way
as
though
she
wished
after
all
to
attract
him
but
since
that
evening
at
the
hotel
spaander
in
volendam
she
has
been
quite
subdued
jonkheer
brederode
is
quiet
and
rather
distant
too
and
sometimes
i
think
he
speaks
to
nell
coldly
as
if
he
distrusted
such
shy
signs
of
friendliness
as
she
still
shows
now
it
seems
to
me
that
he
and
van
buren
and
starr
are
three
friends
worth
having
not
just
the
accidental
sort
of
friends
friendines
nell
calls
that
kind
who
happen
to
be
your
friends
because
you
were
thrown
with
them
somewhere
and
you
would
not
miss
them
dreadfully
if
you
drifted
apart
they
seem
ones
you
were
to
meet
just
as
much
as
you
are
destined
to
be
born
and
to
die
friends
intended
to
be
in
your
life
and
never
go
out
of
it
i
scarcely
knew
in
the
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
which
of
the
three
i
liked
best
and
now
that
i
know
i
equally
nice
to
them
all
because
one
should
do
as
one
would
be
done
by
and
i
love
to
have
people
nice
to
me
van
buren
has
been
with
us
the
last
two
days
and
i
can
see
that
he
watches
his
friend
and
me
if
we
chance
to
be
together
i
should
like
to
know
if
he
too
has
the
idea
that
jonkheer
brederode
cares
about
me
and
if
so
whether
he
wonders
how
it
possible
for
any
man
to
admire
me
more
than
nell
who
is
so
beautiful
and
brilliant
and
amusing
i
ca
help
being
flattered
that
such
an
interesting
person
as
the
jonkheer
like
my
society
better
than
nell
though
i
can
hardly
believe
it
true
but
somehow
it
would
be
nice
to
have
van
buren
believe
it
as
then
he
would
be
obliged
to
think
me
quite
a
fascinating
girl
even
though
it
probably
would
have
occurred
to
him
before
being
engaged
and
so
on
to
regard
me
in
that
light
of
his
own
accord
i
should
love
to
talk
to
nell
about
all
this
in
the
sweet
old
way
we
used
to
have
and
i
do
miss
a
lady
macnairne
is
a
most
wonderful
little
woman
who
manages
every
one
of
us
and
we
would
do
anything
to
please
her
yet
i
should
never
dream
of
confiding
in
her
i
do
know
why
unless
it
because
she
all
blue
spectacles
and
gray
hair
and
if
you
never
can
see
what
people
are
thinking
about
behind
their
glasses
whether
they
sighing
over
your
troubles
or
laughing
how
can
you
tell
them
sacred
things
about
yourself
sometimes
i
think
it
a
pity
that
starr
is
a
man
if
only
he
were
a
girl
he
would
be
the
most
delightful
person
to
have
for
a
confidant
in
spite
of
his
impish
moods
which
make
him
seem
often
like
an
elfin
boy
as
jonkheer
brederode
says
he
extraordinarily
sympathetic
i
feel
that
he
understands
nell
and
me
thoroughly
and
as
he
is
good
to
look
at
and
clever
and
fascinating
in
his
manner
when
he
chooses
i
wonder
why
neither
of
us
has
fallen
in
love
with
him
but
very
likely
nell
has
if
she
has
she
has
been
flirting
with
him
horribly
xxii
it
was
like
finding
an
old
friend
to
see
van
buren
waiting
to
meet
us
at
quaint
little
volendam
he
explained
that
freule
menela
had
gone
to
brussels
to
pay
a
visit
so
hearing
from
me
when
we
would
arrive
he
ran
out
to
inquire
how
his
cousin
was
getting
on
when
his
fiancée
came
back
he
said
he
would
bring
her
and
his
sisters
to
see
us
our
first
sight
of
volendam
was
at
sunset
everything
seemed
so
beautiful
and
i
felt
so
happy
walking
up
to
the
hotel
where
we
were
to
spend
the
night
that
i
should
have
liked
to
sing
great
clouds
had
boiled
up
out
of
the
west
but
underneath
a
wonderful
almost
supernatural
light
streamed
over
the
sea
the
sky
was
indigo
and
the
water
a
sullen
lead
color
but
along
the
horizon
blazed
a
belt
of
gold
and
the
sails
on
a
fleet
of
were
scarlet
like
a
bed
of
red
geraniums
blooming
in
the
sea
it
was
in
this
strange
light
that
we
walked
from
the
harbor
up
the
main
street
of
the
village
which
is
a
long
dyke
of
black
norwegian
granite
protecting
little
houses
the
lower
stories
of
a
sober
color
the
upper
ones
with
the
peaked
gables
or
blue
and
the
sabots
of
the
family
lying
on
the
here
and
there
in
a
window
were
a
few
bits
of
gaudy
china
for
sale
or
a
sabot
over
a
door
as
the
sign
of
a
but
we
hardly
looked
at
the
houses
so
interesting
were
their
inmates
who
seemed
to
be
all
in
the
street
along
the
dyke
squatted
a
double
row
of
men
old
and
young
mostly
old
but
all
as
brown
as
if
they
had
been
carved
out
of
oak
every
one
had
a
jersey
and
enormously
baggy
trousers
like
those
other
men
round
the
corner
of
the
zuider
zee
at
marken
but
at
marken
the
jerseys
were
dark
and
here
of
the
most
wonderful
crimson
the
new
ones
the
shade
of
a
jacqueminot
rose
the
faded
ones
like
the
lovely
roses
which
nell
calls
american
beauties
there
they
sat
with
their
legs
crossed
and
their
cloth
or
fur
caps
tilted
over
their
eyes
as
they
smoked
very
handsome
bold
eyes
some
of
them
and
passing
up
and
down
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
row
as
if
in
review
with
a
musical
clatter
of
sabots
bands
of
women
lovely
girls
and
charming
little
buttons
of
children
nell
and
i
admired
the
costumes
more
than
at
marken
though
they
not
as
striking
only
innocently
pretty
but
i
ca
imagine
anything
more
becoming
than
the
transparent
white
caps
that
fold
back
and
flare
out
over
the
ears
like
a
soaring
bird
wings
perhaps
it
was
partly
the
effect
of
the
light
but
the
young
girls
in
their
straight
dark
bodices
with
flowered
full
blue
skirts
pieced
with
stuff
from
waist
to
hips
and
those
flying
winged
caps
looked
angelic
they
walked
with
their
arms
round
each
other
waists
or
else
they
knitted
with
gleaming
needles
quite
toddling
creatures
had
blue
yokes
over
their
shoulders
and
carried
splashing
pails
of
water
as
big
as
themselves
or
they
had
round
tots
of
babies
tucked
under
their
arms
but
whatever
they
were
doing
men
women
girls
boys
and
babies
all
stopped
doing
it
instantly
when
they
spied
tibe
i
do
believe
they
knew
he
was
a
dog
and
though
he
has
invariably
had
a
wherever
we
have
been
i
never
saw
people
so
mad
about
him
as
at
volendam
the
jonkheer
says
there
are
nearly
three
thousand
inhabitants
and
half
of
them
were
after
tibe
on
the
dyke
as
we
walked
toward
the
hotel
the
news
of
him
seemed
to
fly
as
they
say
tidings
travel
through
the
indian
bazaars
faces
appeared
in
windows
then
quaint
figures
popped
out
of
doors
and
tibe
was
actually
mobbed
a
procession
trailed
after
him
shouting
laughing
calling
tibe
was
flattered
at
first
and
preened
himself
for
admiration
but
presently
he
became
worried
then
disgusted
and
ran
before
the
storm
of
voices
and
wooden
shoes
we
were
all
glad
to
get
him
into
the
hotel
such
a
quaint
hotel
with
incredibly
neat
rooms
whose
varnished
green
wooden
walls
you
could
use
for
mirrors
i
did
know
that
it
was
famous
but
it
seems
that
it
is
also
the
landlord
and
his
many
daughters
every
artist
who
has
ever
come
to
volendam
has
painted
a
picture
for
the
big
room
which
you
enter
as
you
walk
in
from
the
street
and
i
saw
half
a
dozen
which
i
should
love
to
own
it
was
fun
dining
on
a
big
covered
balcony
looking
over
the
zuider
zee
and
seeing
the
horizon
populous
with
in
the
falling
dusk
they
looked
like
the
flitting
figures
of
tall
graceful
ladies
moving
together
hand
in
hand
with
flowing
skirts
some
in
gossiping
knots
others
hovering
proudly
apart
in
pairs
like
princesses
it
is
wonderful
how
our
chaperon
makes
friends
with
people
and
gets
them
to
do
as
she
likes
if
she
were
young
and
pretty
it
would
be
strange
at
least
where
men
are
concerned
but
though
her
complexion
what
one
can
see
of
it
looks
fresh
if
pale
and
she
has
no
hollows
or
wrinkles
her
hair
is
gray
and
she
wears
blue
spectacles
with
only
a
bit
of
face
really
visible
one
hardly
knows
what
she
does
look
like
nevertheless
the
men
of
our
party
are
her
slaves
and
it
is
the
same
at
hotels
if
at
first
landlords
say
tibe
ca
live
in
the
house
the
next
minute
when
she
has
wheedled
a
little
they
are
patting
his
head
calling
him
good
dog
and
telling
his
mistress
that
they
will
make
an
exception
in
his
case
the
morning
after
we
arrived
in
volendam
i
got
up
early
because
van
buren
offered
to
show
me
the
place
if
i
cared
to
take
a
walk
it
was
only
eight
when
we
strolled
out
of
the
hotel
and
the
first
person
i
met
was
lady
macnairne
she
had
been
walking
and
was
on
her
way
back
looking
like
the
old
woman
in
the
shoe
surrounded
by
children
of
all
sizes
she
had
made
friends
with
them
and
taken
their
photographs
and
their
sisters
had
told
her
lots
of
things
about
volendam
she
had
found
out
that
as
soon
as
the
fisherfolk
sons
begin
to
dress
like
boys
they
are
given
their
buckles
and
the
gold
or
silver
knobs
which
are
different
for
each
of
holland
so
that
if
a
man
is
found
drowned
you
can
tell
where
he
comes
from
by
his
buttons
she
had
learned
that
the
trousers
are
baggy
because
in
storms
the
men
do
get
as
wet
as
in
tight
ones
that
the
women
wear
eight
petticoats
not
only
because
it
the
mode
but
because
it
considered
beautiful
for
a
girl
to
look
stout
and
besides
it
not
thought
modest
to
show
how
you
are
shaped
another
thing
she
learned
was
that
just
as
the
boys
must
have
their
buckles
and
buttons
and
if
they
can
get
them
each
volendam
girl
if
she
wishes
to
be
anybody
must
have
a
coral
necklace
with
a
gold
cross
several
silver
rings
a
silver
buckle
for
her
purse
and
a
with
a
silver
top
and
foot
no
girl
could
hope
to
marry
well
lady
macnairne
said
without
these
things
and
as
the
ones
who
told
her
had
no
rings
or
in
their
collections
she
would
get
her
nephew
to
buy
them
it
would
do
for
him
to
make
the
presents
himself
as
the
girls
were
proud
though
their
fathers
earned
only
five
gulden
a
week
but
she
would
give
them
and
then
it
would
be
all
right
one
of
the
girls
was
unhappy
as
she
was
in
love
with
a
young
fisherman
and
they
were
too
poor
to
marry
so
she
expected
to
go
to
rotterdam
as
a
nursemaid
it
seems
said
lady
macnairne
that
volendam
girls
are
in
demand
all
over
holland
as
nurses
they
so
good
to
children
and
animals
but
this
one
wo
have
to
go
for
dear
ronny
must
supply
her
have
you
asked
him
i
inquired
she
laughed
no
said
she
he
do
it
though
to
please
me
i
know
these
things
were
not
all
she
had
found
out
she
knew
that
volendam
had
first
been
made
famous
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
by
an
artist
named
clausen
who
came
by
accident
and
went
away
to
tell
all
his
friends
she
knew
how
the
hotel
spaander
had
been
started
to
please
the
artists
and
how
it
had
grown
year
by
year
and
all
the
things
that
people
told
her
she
had
written
in
a
which
she
wears
dangling
from
a
chatelaine
it
does
seem
odd
for
a
scotswoman
and
one
of
her
rank
to
be
so
keen
about
every
detail
of
travel
that
she
must
scribble
it
down
in
a
book
in
a
frantic
hurry
but
then
many
things
about
lady
macnairne
odd
the
sun
was
blazing
that
morning
but
a
wind
had
come
up
in
the
night
and
beaten
the
waves
into
froth
the
dark
stretched
unevenly
along
the
horizon
and
there
were
no
to
be
seen
all
were
snugly
nestled
in
harbor
with
their
gay
pennants
just
visible
over
the
pointed
roofs
of
the
houses
and
we
had
an
exciting
breakfast
on
the
balcony
because
though
it
was
cold
the
tablecloths
and
napkins
flapped
wildly
in
the
wind
like
big
white
rings
of
frightened
swans
jonkheer
brederode
had
planned
to
go
northward
skirting
the
coast
to
see
two
more
dead
cities
of
the
zuider
zee
hoorn
and
enkhuisen
and
cut
across
the
sea
to
stavoren
on
the
other
side
to
enter
the
frisian
meers
but
now
he
refused
to
take
us
that
way
the
men
might
go
if
they
liked
he
said
and
there
really
was
much
danger
but
in
such
rough
weather
he
could
allow
women
to
run
the
risk
in
lorelei
but
it
would
be
in
lady
macnairne
put
in
has
ceased
to
exist
nell
grew
pink
and
i
think
i
grew
pale
it
was
an
awful
shock
to
hear
her
speak
so
calmly
about
the
loss
of
our
dear
boat
of
which
we
have
grown
so
fond
ceased
to
exist
i
repeated
cold
all
over
has
she
only
under
a
coat
of
paint
said
starr
hurriedly
you
know
miss
van
buren
consented
to
humor
my
aunt
who
thought
the
name
unlucky
by
rechristening
the
boat
so
i
did
it
myself
this
morning
the
first
thing
before
there
were
many
people
about
to
get
in
my
way
i
forgotten
said
nell
but
if
she
now
is
that
a
sign
she
could
take
us
safely
through
the
sea
they
only
miniature
waves
you
would
think
so
if
you
were
in
their
midst
in
a
said
the
jonkheer
i
ready
to
try
nell
answered
but
i
not
ready
to
let
you
he
said
with
one
of
his
nice
smiles
however
this
did
conciliate
nell
in
an
instant
she
bristled
up
as
she
used
to
with
him
before
amsterdam
it
my
boat
she
said
but
i
the
boat
skipper
the
skipper
must
act
according
to
his
judgment
joking
apart
though
i
joking
if
men
can
go
why
ca
women
we
not
afraid
it
would
be
fun
not
for
the
men
if
they
had
women
to
think
of
you
see
the
boat
is
owing
to
the
cabin
superstructure
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
turn
turtle
in
a
heavy
sea
besides
rough
waves
might
break
the
cabin
windows
and
if
she
began
to
take
in
water
in
that
way
we
should
be
done
for
no
bailing
could
help
us
do
you
still
want
to
make
the
trip
miss
van
buren
i
do
nell
insisted
because
i
do
believe
those
things
will
happen
neither
do
i
or
i
should
care
to
risk
your
boat
but
there
a
chance
i
should
dream
of
venturing
said
lady
macnairne
and
i
sure
phyllis
would
go
without
her
chaperon
would
you
dear
no
i
answered
and
that
mercifully
settled
it
for
nell
as
she
could
take
a
trip
alone
with
the
men
in
any
case
it
pleasanter
to
drive
from
here
to
hoorn
and
enkhuisen
went
on
the
jonkheer
and
the
only
real
reason
for
sticking
to
the
boat
even
in
fine
weather
would
have
been
that
you
came
to
holland
in
a
and
wanted
to
be
true
to
your
principles
the
coast
is
flat
and
low
and
you
have
seen
nothing
except
a
line
of
land
which
would
have
looked
uninteresting
across
the
water
whereas
in
my
car
but
your
car
is
here
objected
nell
it
may
be
any
minute
now
i
been
expecting
it
for
the
last
hour
i
was
trusting
entirely
to
luck
when
we
came
and
my
chauffeur
had
orders
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
for
a
telegram
last
night
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
wind
getting
up
i
wired
him
in
amsterdam
where
he
was
waiting
to
start
as
soon
as
it
was
light
you
a
wonderful
fellow
said
van
buren
and
i
complimented
him
too
but
nell
did
speak
a
few
minutes
later
we
heard
the
whirr
of
a
motor
and
the
buzz
of
excited
voices
we
had
just
finished
breakfast
so
we
rushed
from
the
balcony
at
the
back
of
the
house
through
the
big
room
of
the
pictures
to
the
front
door
and
there
was
jonkheer
brederode
car
on
the
dyke
which
is
the
only
road
with
the
smart
little
chauffeur
smiling
and
touching
his
cap
to
his
master
amid
a
swarm
of
girls
and
boys
it
was
decided
that
only
jonkheer
brederode
and
hendrik
with
toon
on
the
barge
should
test
the
seaworthy
qualities
while
van
buren
and
starr
stopped
with
us
this
was
the
jonkheer
idea
he
would
prefer
it
he
said
as
the
fewer
there
were
on
lorelei
alias
mascotte
the
better
and
van
buren
ought
to
be
with
us
to
tell
us
about
places
i
think
all
the
men
would
have
liked
the
adventure
but
they
say
that
they
did
want
to
be
of
our
party
and
lady
macnairne
actually
begged
her
nephew
to
come
in
the
motor
she
did
confess
that
she
was
afraid
for
him
the
reason
she
gave
was
that
she
could
take
care
of
tibe
in
the
car
without
his
help
i
was
sure
she
was
anxious
though
i
could
help
being
glad
for
his
family
sake
that
van
buren
was
safe
as
safe
as
any
one
can
be
in
a
it
did
seem
sad
that
jonkheer
brederode
was
left
to
brave
the
danger
without
his
friends
all
lady
macnairne
thought
was
for
her
nephew
and
so
i
felt
it
would
be
only
kind
to
show
the
jonkheer
that
some
one
cared
about
i
begged
him
to
let
hendrik
manage
the
boat
alone
for
i
said
we
should
all
be
so
worried
that
it
would
spoil
our
drive
i
supposed
nell
would
join
with
me
as
lady
macnairne
did
if
only
enough
for
civility
but
she
would
say
a
word
however
though
she
pretended
to
be
more
interested
in
examining
the
car
than
listening
to
our
conversation
she
was
pale
with
the
air
of
having
a
headache
jonkheer
brederode
was
pleased
i
think
to
feel
that
some
one
took
an
interest
in
him
but
he
made
light
of
the
danger
and
saw
us
off
so
merrily
that
i
forgot
to
worry
van
buren
did
want
to
drive
starr
does
know
how
and
as
nell
said
she
would
like
to
sit
in
front
with
the
chauffeur
lady
macnairne
and
i
had
the
two
men
in
the
with
us
we
were
gay
but
nell
did
turn
round
once
to
join
in
our
talk
she
sat
there
beside
the
chauffeur
as
glum
as
if
she
had
lost
her
last
friend
perhaps
she
was
alarmed
for
her
boat
as
she
does
care
about
the
jonkheer
now
we
began
to
see
what
a
dutch
dyke
really
is
and
i
could
imagine
men
riding
furiously
along
the
high
narrow
road
carrying
the
news
to
village
after
village
that
the
water
was
rising
there
was
just
room
on
top
for
anything
we
might
meet
to
pass
but
the
chauffeur
drove
slowly
and
van
buren
said
there
was
no
danger
so
i
was
afraid
there
was
a
sense
of
protection
in
sitting
next
to
him
he
is
so
big
and
dependable
i
felt
he
would
not
anything
hurt
me
and
once
in
a
while
he
looked
at
me
with
a
very
nice
look
i
suppose
he
has
even
nicer
ones
for
freule
menela
though
when
they
are
alone
together
it
is
a
pity
her
manner
is
so
much
against
her
although
i
was
terrified
it
was
an
exciting
drive
running
along
on
the
high
dyke
i
could
hardly
believe
it
when
van
buren
said
there
were
bigger
ones
in
zeeland
with
the
zuider
zee
on
one
side
and
the
wide
green
reaches
of
jonkheer
brederode
hollow
land
on
the
other
i
shivered
to
think
what
would
happen
if
the
hungry
sea
forever
gnawing
at
the
granite
pile
were
to
break
it
down
and
pour
over
the
land
many
times
in
the
past
such
awful
things
happened
what
if
were
the
day
for
it
to
happen
again
i
asked
van
buren
if
he
did
wake
up
sometimes
in
the
night
with
an
attack
of
the
horrors
but
he
seemed
anxious
to
soothe
me
as
if
he
did
want
his
country
spoiled
for
me
by
fears
the
corps
of
engineers
who
look
after
the
coast
defenses
is
the
best
in
the
world
he
said
edam
was
our
first
town
and
it
was
odd
to
see
it
after
nibbling
its
cheeses
more
or
less
all
one
life
and
never
thinking
of
the
place
they
came
from
the
funniest
thing
was
that
it
smelled
of
cheese
a
delicious
smell
that
seemed
a
part
of
the
town
tranquillity
just
as
the
perfume
seems
part
of
a
flower
in
most
of
the
pretty
old
houses
with
their
glittering
ornamental
tiles
there
was
some
sign
of
and
all
the
people
of
edam
must
have
been
busy
making
it
as
we
saw
only
two
or
three
we
stopped
in
a
large
public
square
with
a
pattern
in
the
colored
pavement
like
carpet
and
the
place
was
so
quiet
that
the
sound
of
the
silence
droned
in
our
ears
and
this
said
van
buren
was
once
one
of
the
proudest
cities
of
the
zuider
zee
my
goodness
exclaimed
lady
macnairne
is
this
little
old
thing
another
of
the
dead
cities
well
i
sure
it
could
have
been
half
as
nice
when
it
was
alive
and
down
something
went
in
her
we
drove
by
a
park
a
noble
church
and
the
loveliest
cemetery
i
ever
saw
not
at
all
sad
i
could
not
think
of
the
dead
there
but
only
of
children
playing
and
lovers
strolling
under
the
trees
as
soon
as
we
were
outside
edam
we
began
to
pass
windmills
quite
different
from
any
we
had
seen
before
they
were
just
like
stout
dutch
ladies
smartly
dressed
in
green
with
coats
and
bonnets
of
gray
thatch
and
greenish
veils
over
their
faces
half
hiding
the
big
eyes
which
gazed
alway
toward
the
dyke
that
imprisons
the
zuider
zee
we
had
been
off
the
dyke
and
skimming
along
an
ordinary
dutch
road
for
a
while
but
presently
we
swerved
toward
the
right
and
were
again
on
a
dyke
sloping
toward
the
sea
sailing
along
its
level
top
we
could
see
far
off
the
embowered
roofs
and
spires
of
a
town
which
van
buren
said
was
the
once
powerful
city
of
hoorn
is
there
a
cape
somewhere
named
after
it
asked
lady
macnairne
gaily
and
van
buren
answering
that
william
schouten
the
sailor
who
discovered
the
cape
named
it
after
his
native
town
looked
surprised
at
her
ignorance
she
does
seem
to
know
much
about
history
but
she
will
know
a
great
deal
about
holland
before
we
finish
this
trip
if
she
goes
on
as
she
is
going
now
in
ten
minutes
we
were
in
the
suburbs
in
five
more
we
were
in
the
dead
city
itself
but
it
had
the
air
of
having
been
resurrected
and
being
delighted
to
find
itself
alive
again
we
passed
row
upon
row
of
wonderful
carts
shaped
like
the
cars
of
classical
goddesses
though
no
goddess
would
have
her
car
painted
green
outside
and
blue
or
scarlet
within
by
jove
now
i
know
why
brederode
was
so
keen
on
our
getting
off
early
and
not
waiting
at
volendam
till
for
the
wind
to
die
exclaimed
van
buren
what
a
fellow
he
is
to
think
of
everything
this
is
the
one
and
only
time
to
find
hoorn
at
its
best
and
now
you
will
see
some
nice
things
he
had
the
chauffeur
slow
down
the
car
in
a
fascinating
street
with
quaint
houses
leaning
back
or
sidewise
and
bearing
themselves
as
they
pleased
which
way
for
the
cheese
market
van
buren
asked
an
old
man
with
a
wreath
of
white
fur
under
his
chin
he
asked
in
dutch
but
so
many
dutch
words
sound
like
caricatures
of
english
ones
that
i
begin
to
understand
now
besides
i
have
bought
a
grammar
and
study
it
in
the
evenings
this
pleased
van
buren
when
i
told
him
and
he
says
i
have
made
splendid
progress
i
got
as
far
as
i
love
you
love
he
loves
and
so
on
i
think
dutch
an
extremely
interesting
language
the
old
man
told
us
which
way
to
go
and
turning
up
a
street
we
should
never
have
thought
of
we
came
out
in
a
huge
presided
over
by
a
statue
of
coen
a
man
who
founded
the
dutch
dominion
in
the
west
indies
or
something
which
van
buren
thought
important
we
have
often
wondered
where
the
people
of
the
towns
hide
themselves
but
there
was
no
such
puzzle
in
hoorn
the
looked
as
if
half
the
population
of
north
holland
might
be
there
the
whole
of
the
square
was
covered
with
cheeses
large
shiny
cheeses
yellow
as
monstrous
oranges
they
glittered
so
radiantly
in
the
sunlight
that
you
felt
they
might
at
any
instant
burst
out
into
a
flame
between
the
great
glowing
mounds
little
paths
had
been
left
and
along
these
paths
walked
lines
of
solemn
men
inspecting
the
burning
globes
and
bargaining
with
their
possessors
while
outside
the
huge
space
there
was
a
moving
crowd
gay
and
shifting
as
the
figures
made
by
bits
of
colored
glass
in
a
kaleidoscope
illustration
men
inspecting
burning
globes
and
bargaining
with
their
we
expected
to
create
a
sensation
with
the
motor
but
the
cheeses
were
more
interesting
and
nobody
had
time
for
more
than
a
glance
at
us
suddenly
as
we
sat
gazing
at
the
scene
affairs
in
the
came
to
some
kind
of
crisis
a
stream
of
men
appeared
dressed
in
spotless
white
from
head
to
foot
and
wearing
varnished
hard
straw
hats
of
different
colors
soon
we
saw
it
was
the
hats
which
determined
everything
the
men
walked
together
the
red
hats
formed
another
party
the
yellow
hats
a
third
and
so
on
each
corps
carried
large
yet
shallow
trays
suspended
from
their
shoulders
two
men
to
a
tray
and
falling
upon
the
piles
of
cheeses
they
gathered
them
up
with
incredible
quickness
then
when
the
trays
were
loaded
with
a
pyramid
of
cheeses
off
rushed
the
men
to
a
wonderful
weigh
house
which
van
buren
says
is
famous
throughout
all
north
holland
inside
were
many
men
busy
as
bees
weighing
cheeses
with
enormous
scales
down
dropped
the
trays
the
weight
was
taken
and
away
darted
the
men
bearing
the
yellow
treasures
to
some
neighboring
warehouse
we
watched
the
weighing
for
a
long
time
until
we
were
so
hungry
that
we
could
feel
no
enthusiasm
for
anything
except
lunch
but
as
we
drove
through
crowded
streets
to
a
hotel
it
was
interesting
to
pass
warehouses
where
cheeses
were
being
stored
the
porters
with
the
bright
hats
worn
to
denote
their
ancient
guilds
were
standing
on
the
pavement
tossing
up
cheeses
like
conjurors
keeping
a
lot
of
oranges
in
the
air
men
above
standing
in
open
lofts
caught
the
golden
balls
as
they
flew
up
and
stored
them
among
crowds
of
others
that
seemed
to
illuminate
the
dim
background
like
lanterns
glowing
in
the
dark
we
lunched
at
an
hotel
with
enormous
rooms
and
then
as
we
had
time
we
wound
through
the
chief
streets
of
the
dead
city
stopping
now
and
then
to
study
on
ancient
houses
telling
of
stirring
events
when
the
name
of
hoorn
sounded
loud
in
the
world
there
was
one
stone
picture
of
many
old
ships
in
commotion
among
impossible
waves
and
the
description
was
all
in
one
word
bossuzeeslag
it
seemed
very
impressive
to
sit
staring
up
at
it
while
van
buren
told
how
we
whipped
the
spanish
ship
inquisition
after
thirty
hours
fighting
on
the
and
all
the
people
of
hoorn
assembled
to
look
on
after
seeing
the
house
where
graaf
bossu
was
kept
prisoner
our
interest
in
the
hoorn
of
long
ago
was
kindled
to
a
blaze
van
buren
proposed
taking
us
to
the
museum
so
we
all
went
except
poor
starr
who
sat
in
front
of
the
handsome
building
in
the
on
dog
duty
as
he
calls
it
i
liked
the
reproduction
of
an
old
dutch
inn
and
the
plans
of
the
dead
cities
as
they
used
to
be
but
the
paintings
of
burgomasters
in
black
with
ruffles
and
conical
hats
were
pathetic
the
men
in
their
short
frilled
trousers
and
high
boots
thought
themselves
so
important
poor
dears
with
their
piteous
forefingers
proudly
pointing
to
maps
and
specifications
that
it
was
sad
to
see
them
still
doing
it
when
all
their
plans
had
come
to
nothing
long
ago
we
admired
hoorn
as
it
is
but
it
would
break
their
hearts
if
they
could
see
it
given
up
to
cheese
and
only
of
importance
in
the
cheese
world
we
were
not
in
the
museum
long
but
starr
had
suffered
tortures
meanwhile
and
looked
ten
years
older
when
we
came
out
tibe
had
been
asleep
on
the
floor
of
the
while
we
were
in
the
before
lunch
so
nobody
had
seen
him
but
deserted
by
his
mistress
he
sat
up
in
the
car
to
look
for
her
and
the
caught
sight
of
him
word
went
round
that
there
was
a
strange
monster
a
cross
between
a
monkey
and
a
goblin
sitting
in
an
automobile
and
all
the
people
of
hoorn
poured
into
the
street
to
see
the
show
just
as
they
had
poured
to
the
harbor
more
than
three
hundred
years
ago
when
the
zeeslag
was
going
on
we
came
out
to
find
the
car
almost
lost
to
sight
in
the
crush
but
van
buren
who
is
like
a
great
handsome
viking
pushed
the
people
aside
and
said
things
to
them
in
dutch
which
made
some
laugh
and
others
grumble
to
escape
we
drove
out
of
the
town
into
suburbs
with
little
streets
and
tiny
houses
on
dykes
each
one
with
its
drawbridge
across
the
stream
running
on
either
side
a
and
now
we
seemed
to
be
in
the
heart
of
toyland
it
was
like
a
place
built
by
santa
claus
to
come
to
at
christmas
time
and
choose
presents
to
fill
his
pack
aalsmeer
and
which
we
had
thought
were
villages
for
people
compared
to
this
on
we
went
penetrating
further
into
the
instead
of
running
out
of
it
the
brown
yellow
green
and
red
carts
ornamented
with
festoons
of
flowers
in
carved
wood
which
were
returning
from
market
were
the
only
things
we
saw
except
the
trees
and
they
seemed
abnormally
tall
by
way
of
contrast
mile
after
mile
the
road
to
enkhuisen
led
on
between
two
lines
of
dolls
houses
and
gardens
some
must
have
been
meant
for
very
large
dolls
but
that
made
no
difference
in
the
toy
effect
as
the
great
farmhouses
apportioned
off
half
for
toy
animals
half
for
were
just
as
fantastic
in
design
and
decoration
as
the
tiny
ones
backgrounds
of
meadows
canals
and
windmills
i
suppose
there
must
have
been
as
every
picture
has
to
have
its
background
but
backgrounds
are
seldom
obtrusive
in
holland
as
starr
says
and
here
the
two
lines
of
toy
dwellings
were
so
astonishing
that
we
noted
nothing
else
for
the
whole
ten
miles
of
the
drive
we
were
playing
dolls
the
long
straight
string
of
houses
was
knotted
now
and
then
into
the
semblance
of
a
village
but
never
was
the
string
broken
between
hoorn
and
enkhuisen
and
though
we
saw
so
many
each
new
made
us
laugh
as
if
it
were
the
first
i
tried
not
to
laugh
at
the
beginning
lest
it
might
hurt
van
buren
feelings
but
he
did
mind
and
pointed
out
the
funniest
front
doors
crusted
with
colored
flowers
like
the
icing
on
a
birthday
cake
sprinkled
with
hundreds
of
thousands
after
that
i
laughed
as
much
as
i
liked
at
everything
though
i
was
sure
the
people
who
had
built
the
houses
took
them
quite
seriously
and
admired
them
beyond
words
you
felt
that
each
man
had
put
his
whole
soul
into
the
scheme
of
his
house
trying
to
outdo
his
neighbors
in
color
or
originality
there
would
be
a
house
with
a
front
for
the
lower
story
and
the
upper
one
including
gables
done
in
wood
painted
then
the
sides
of
the
house
would
be
in
green
and
white
stripes
the
the
tiny
sparkling
panes
twinkling
out
like
diamonds
set
in
turquoises
but
these
would
not
be
the
only
colors
to
dazzle
your
eyes
as
you
flashed
through
the
tall
gothic
archway
of
trees
darkening
the
road
there
would
be
a
deep
band
of
ultramarine
distemper
running
all
round
a
house
the
trunks
of
the
trees
and
the
fence
would
be
brilliantly
blue
and
despite
a
dash
of
scarlet
here
and
there
as
you
approached
you
had
the
impression
of
coming
to
a
lake
of
azure
water
further
on
would
be
another
house
yellow
and
scarlet
and
white
having
a
door
like
a
mosaic
with
raised
patterns
of
flowers
in
pink
blue
and
purple
on
a
background
of
gold
or
black
and
the
high
pointed
roof
half
thatched
half
covered
with
glittering
black
tiles
these
roofs
made
the
houses
look
as
if
they
had
bald
shiny
foreheads
with
thick
hair
on
top
and
gave
the
windows
a
curiously
wise
expression
but
if
the
homesteads
with
their
additions
for
families
of
horses
and
cows
were
extraordinary
they
were
commonplace
compared
with
the
chicken
or
shaped
like
chateaux
or
chinese
pagodas
wreathed
with
flowers
when
at
last
we
drove
under
a
gateway
across
the
road
and
the
color
was
suddenly
extinguished
as
if
a
show
of
fireworks
were
over
we
all
felt
as
though
we
had
come
back
to
the
everyday
world
after
an
excursion
into
elfland
it
was
the
entrance
to
enkhuisen
the
last
of
the
dead
cities
which
we
were
to
visit
a
strange
sad
old
town
with
a
charming
park
churches
three
times
too
big
for
it
and
beautiful
houses
small
but
perfect
as
cameos
we
drove
to
the
harbor
not
only
to
see
the
wonderful
humpbacked
dromedary
tower
but
to
find
out
whether
there
were
any
news
of
our
boat
before
going
to
the
hotel
a
stiff
wind
was
blowing
the
sea
was
gray
and
waves
tossed
angrily
against
the
breakwater
nothing
had
been
heard
of
and
though
we
left
the
car
and
walked
to
the
outer
harbor
straining
our
eyes
in
the
direction
whence
she
should
come
no
craft
resembling
her
was
in
sight
the
beauty
of
the
day
had
died
sky
and
water
were
dull
as
lead
and
nell
face
as
she
stood
gazing
out
to
sea
looked
pallid
in
the
bleak
light
suddenly
we
felt
depressed
though
van
buren
said
it
was
hardly
time
to
expect
news
as
we
lingered
the
most
exquisite
music
began
to
fall
over
our
heads
apparently
from
the
sky
like
a
shower
of
jewels
the
chimes
of
the
dromedary
said
van
buren
looking
up
at
the
strong
dark
tower
looming
above
us
our
eyes
followed
his
and
the
music
sprayed
over
us
in
a
lovely
fountain
had
the
bells
been
all
of
silver
rung
by
fairies
the
notes
could
not
have
been
sweeter
in
itself
the
air
was
not
sad
yet
it
pierced
to
the
heart
and
as
the
chimes
played
i
found
that
i
was
a
great
deal
more
anxious
about
jonkheer
brederode
than
i
had
thought
the
tears
came
to
my
eyes
and
when
lady
macnairne
asked
what
was
the
matter
i
said
impulsively
that
i
could
help
being
frightened
for
our
friend
doing
his
duty
so
bravely
by
nell
boat
going
back
to
the
hotel
we
were
all
miserable
even
van
buren
seemed
wretched
though
i
ca
think
why
as
he
said
he
was
not
anxious
about
the
jonkheer
and
lady
macnairne
forgot
to
put
it
down
in
her
when
some
one
told
her
that
enkhuisen
was
the
birthplace
of
paul
potter
xxiii
i
shall
never
forget
that
night
at
enkhuisen
or
the
hotel
starr
said
it
was
no
wonder
cities
of
the
zuider
zee
died
if
they
were
brought
up
on
hotels
like
that
ours
apparently
had
no
one
to
attend
to
it
except
one
frightened
rabbit
of
a
boy
who
appeared
to
be
manager
hall
porter
waiter
boots
and
chambermaid
in
one
but
when
we
had
scrambled
up
a
stairway
it
was
almost
as
difficult
as
climbing
a
greased
pole
we
found
decent
rooms
and
after
that
things
we
wanted
came
by
some
mysterious
means
we
knew
not
how
it
was
an
adventure
sliding
down
to
dinner
tibe
fell
from
top
to
bottom
into
a
kind
of
black
well
and
upset
lady
macnairne
completely
she
said
she
hated
enkhuisen
and
she
thought
it
a
dispensation
of
providence
that
the
sand
had
come
and
silted
it
up
we
had
quite
good
things
for
dinner
but
we
ate
in
a
with
no
fresh
air
because
the
commercial
travelers
who
sat
at
the
same
table
with
napkins
tucked
under
their
chins
refused
to
have
the
windows
open
van
buren
wanted
to
defy
them
but
his
chin
looked
so
square
and
the
commercial
travelers
eyes
got
so
prominent
that
i
begged
to
have
the
windows
left
as
they
were
there
are
churches
to
see
in
enkhuisen
and
a
beautiful
choir
screen
but
we
had
the
heart
to
visit
them
we
said
perhaps
we
would
go
and
added
in
our
minds
if
the
boat
is
safely
in
the
rabbit
hardly
knew
what
we
meant
when
we
asked
for
a
private
and
evidently
thought
it
far
from
a
proper
request
to
add
to
our
melancholy
a
came
up
after
dinner
and
lightning
looped
like
coils
of
silver
ribbon
across
the
sky
and
back
again
while
thunder
deadened
the
chimes
of
the
dromedary
still
there
was
no
news
and
at
last
van
buren
went
out
in
torrents
of
rain
to
the
harbor
we
could
not
bear
to
sit
in
the
where
the
commercial
travelers
in
carpet
slippers
were
smoking
and
discussing
dutch
politics
so
we
clambered
up
the
greased
pole
to
lady
macnairne
room
and
talked
about
philip
the
second
and
tortures
while
tibe
growled
at
the
thunder
and
looked
for
it
under
furniture
and
in
corners
nell
was
in
such
a
black
mood
that
she
would
have
liked
philip
to
be
tortured
through
all
eternity
because
of
the
horrible
suffering
he
inflicted
on
the
people
of
holland
but
i
said
the
worst
punishment
would
be
for
his
soul
to
have
been
purified
at
death
that
he
might
suddenly
realize
the
fiendishness
of
his
own
crimes
see
himself
as
he
really
was
and
go
on
repenting
throughout
endless
years
it
was
not
an
enlivening
conversation
and
in
the
midst
van
buren
came
to
say
that
there
were
no
tidings
of
jonkheer
brederode
and
the
boat
then
nell
jumped
up
very
white
with
shining
eyes
ca
we
do
something
she
asked
her
cousin
shook
his
head
what
is
there
we
can
do
nothing
we
must
wait
and
hope
that
all
is
well
are
you
anxious
now
asked
lady
macnairne
a
little
he
admitted
i
do
know
how
to
bear
it
exclaimed
nell
with
a
choke
in
her
voice
i
longed
to
comfort
her
but
her
wretchedness
seemed
only
to
harden
her
cousin
heart
he
looked
at
her
angrily
it
is
late
for
you
to
worry
he
reproached
her
if
you
had
shown
concern
for
rudolph
safety
this
morning
it
would
have
been
gracious
but
do
she
said
just
the
one
word
and
not
crossly
but
in
such
a
voice
of
appeal
that
he
did
finish
his
sentence
we
sat
about
awkwardly
and
tried
to
speak
of
other
things
but
the
talk
would
drift
to
our
fears
for
the
boat
nell
did
not
join
in
she
sat
by
the
window
looking
out
and
listening
to
the
rain
and
wind
which
made
a
sound
like
the
purring
of
a
great
cat
ten
came
and
lady
macnairne
proposed
that
as
we
could
do
nothing
we
women
should
go
to
bed
then
nell
spoke
no
she
said
you
and
phil
can
do
as
you
like
and
cousin
robert
and
starr
but
i
shall
sit
up
of
course
i
told
her
i
would
sit
up
too
and
as
van
buren
said
the
commercial
travelers
had
left
the
he
and
starr
and
nell
and
i
bade
lady
macnairne
and
went
down
the
unfortunate
rabbit
was
in
the
act
of
putting
out
the
light
but
he
was
obliged
to
leave
it
for
us
a
necessity
which
distressed
him
it
was
eleven
and
the
hotel
was
as
silent
as
a
hotel
in
a
dead
city
ought
to
be
we
talked
spasmodically
sometimes
we
were
still
for
many
minutes
listening
for
sounds
outside
and
we
could
hear
the
scampering
of
mice
behind
the
walls
i
ca
stand
this
said
nell
i
going
to
the
harbor
i
will
take
you
replied
van
buren
no
thank
you
said
nell
i
rather
you
stopped
with
phil
she
has
a
cold
and
must
get
wet
may
i
go
asked
starr
yes
she
said
so
they
stole
away
through
the
sleeping
house
and
presently
we
heard
the
front
door
close
van
buren
and
i
were
alone
together
he
was
good
about
cheering
me
up
saying
he
had
too
much
faith
in
his
friend
courage
and
skill
as
a
yachtsman
to
be
very
anxious
though
the
delay
was
odd
then
suddenly
he
broke
out
with
a
strange
question
would
it
hurt
you
if
anything
should
happen
to
rudolph
brederode
i
was
so
surprised
that
i
could
hardly
answer
at
first
then
i
said
that
of
course
it
would
hurt
me
for
i
liked
and
admired
the
jonkheer
and
considered
him
my
friend
i
have
no
right
to
ask
he
went
on
but
i
do
beg
you
to
say
if
it
is
only
as
a
friend
you
like
rudolph
that
startled
me
for
i
was
afraid
things
i
had
done
might
have
been
misunderstood
owing
to
the
difference
of
ways
in
holland
why
i
stammered
are
you
going
to
warn
me
not
to
care
for
him
because
he
does
care
for
me
how
nell
cousin
robert
looked
so
pale
i
was
afraid
he
must
be
ill
he
put
up
his
hand
and
pushed
his
hair
back
from
his
forehead
and
then
began
pacing
about
the
room
rudolph
care
he
care
if
you
wish
it
he
said
oh
i
exclaimed
i
did
mean
it
was
dreadful
if
he
did
care
but
if
you
thought
did
he
stopped
walking
and
took
one
big
step
that
brought
him
to
me
you
do
not
of
course
not
said
i
not
in
way
van
buren
caught
both
my
hands
and
pressed
them
so
tightly
that
i
could
help
giving
a
tiny
squeak
ah
i
have
hurt
you
he
cried
and
a
strange
expression
came
into
his
eyes
at
least
it
was
strange
that
it
should
be
for
me
instead
of
freule
menela
for
it
was
almost
but
no
i
must
have
been
mistaken
of
course
in
thinking
it
was
like
that
anyway
it
was
a
thrilling
expression
and
made
my
heart
beat
as
fast
as
if
i
were
frightened
though
i
think
that
was
exactly
the
feeling
i
could
take
my
eyes
away
from
his
for
a
minute
we
looked
straight
at
each
other
then
as
if
he
could
resist
he
kissed
my
hands
one
after
the
other
not
with
polite
little
dutch
kisses
but
eager
and
desperate
as
he
did
it
he
gave
a
kind
of
groan
and
before
i
could
speak
he
muttered
forgive
me
as
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
he
must
have
almost
run
against
starr
for
the
next
instant
the
mariner
as
jonkheer
brederode
calls
him
came
in
dripping
wet
there
was
i
all
pink
and
trembling
and
my
voice
did
sound
odd
as
i
quavered
out
where
nell
gone
to
her
room
said
starr
looking
hard
at
me
with
his
brilliant
whimsical
eyes
i
was
to
tell
you
with
that
i
burst
into
tears
good
gracious
poor
angel
what
is
the
matter
he
exclaimed
coming
closer
i
do
know
i
sobbed
but
i
not
an
angel
i
do
believe
i
a
very
girl
you
wicked
why
because
i
got
feelings
i
ought
to
have
and
that
why
you
crying
i
not
sure
but
i
just
ca
help
it
i
wish
i
could
do
something
said
he
quite
miserably
and
i
could
smell
the
wet
serge
of
his
sopping
coat
though
i
could
see
him
for
my
hands
were
over
my
eyes
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
but
not
as
much
ashamed
as
i
would
have
been
with
any
one
else
because
of
the
feeling
i
have
that
starr
would
be
so
wonderfully
nice
and
sympathetic
to
confide
in
not
that
i
have
anything
to
confide
thank
you
but
you
could
nobody
could
i
moaned
not
even
miss
van
buren
not
now
it
too
sad
something
seems
to
have
come
between
us
i
know
what
maybe
that
making
you
cry
no
i
do
think
so
oh
i
unhappy
you
poor
little
dove
you
do
mind
my
calling
you
that
do
you
i
shook
my
head
no
it
comforts
me
it
so
soothing
after
after
after
what
has
anybody
been
beast
enough
nobody
been
a
beast
i
hurried
to
break
in
except
perhaps
do
tell
me
what
troubling
you
he
begged
and
pulled
my
hands
down
from
my
face
not
in
the
way
van
buren
had
caught
them
but
very
gently
i
let
him
lead
me
to
a
sofa
and
dry
my
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
because
it
seemed
exactly
like
having
a
brother
it
was
just
as
nice
to
be
sympathized
with
by
him
as
i
had
often
imagined
it
would
be
and
i
liked
it
so
much
that
i
selfishly
forgot
he
was
soaked
with
rain
and
ought
to
get
out
of
his
wet
clothes
if
i
knew
i
would
tell
you
i
said
you
worried
about
alb
i
mean
brederode
oh
now
i
i
a
beast
i
forgotten
to
ask
about
him
or
the
boats
you
forgotten
by
jove
no
nothing
heard
or
seen
yet
i
made
miss
van
buren
come
back
at
last
had
to
say
i
was
afraid
of
catching
cold
or
she
be
there
now
but
see
here
as
it
is
alb
fate
bothering
you
may
i
make
a
guess
yes
because
you
never
could
guess
said
i
is
it
anything
about
van
buren
my
face
felt
as
if
it
was
on
fire
why
what
it
be
i
asked
it
might
be
for
instance
that
you
sorry
for
him
because
engaged
to
a
brute
of
a
girl
who
sure
to
make
him
miserable
got
such
a
tender
heart
you
partly
right
i
confessed
not
that
he
been
complaining
he
would
do
such
a
thing
no
of
course
not
said
starr
it
wonderful
how
that
should
have
come
into
your
mind
i
said
please
do
think
me
stupid
to
cry
but
suddenly
it
came
over
me
such
agonizing
pity
for
him
i
ca
think
he
loves
her
i
sure
he
does
i
always
wondered
how
he
could
but
i
saw
that
his
engagement
was
making
him
wretched
you
that
yes
you
so
sympathetic
i
could
help
saying
am
i
yes
do
you
know
i
feel
almost
as
if
you
were
my
brother
oh
that
settles
it
it
all
up
with
me
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
whichever
way
i
look
i
find
nothing
but
sisters
i
had
to
promise
myself
to
be
a
brother
to
miss
van
buren
too
do
you
mean
you
promised
her
no
for
i
have
done
that
yet
but
it
will
probably
come
later
would
you
rather
not
be
our
brother
i
hope
i
did
speak
reproachfully
we
ell
my
first
idea
was
that
an
aunt
was
the
only
relative
i
should
have
with
me
on
this
trip
still
i
have
been
delighted
to
be
a
brother
to
one
of
you
if
i
could
only
have
kept
the
other
up
my
sleeve
as
you
might
say
to
be
useful
in
a
different
capacity
you
love
to
puzzle
me
i
said
there
are
lots
of
things
i
love
about
you
as
a
brother
he
answered
with
a
funny
sigh
and
i
was
sure
whether
he
was
poking
fun
at
me
or
not
but
as
for
miss
van
buren
why
could
she
look
upon
van
buren
as
a
brother
he
her
cousin
and
she
does
love
him
much
i
explained
alb
then
she
does
love
him
at
all
are
you
sure
of
that
oh
certain
i
assured
him
quite
earnestly
she
sick
with
anxiety
about
him
anyhow
i
had
to
comfort
her
that
because
she
feels
guilty
for
being
so
disagreeable
i
said
and
she
would
of
course
suffer
dreadful
remorse
poor
girl
if
he
were
drowned
looking
after
her
boat
as
i
pray
he
wo
be
i
began
to
understand
now
poor
starr
was
jealous
of
his
friend
the
jonkheer
well
i
wish
she
love
me
a
little
then
as
there
nobody
else
do
you
know
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
she
i
almost
whispered
perhaps
that
what
making
her
so
queer
i
wish
i
could
think
so
sighed
starr
but
he
did
look
as
radiant
as
one
might
have
expected
he
seemed
more
startled
than
delighted
anyhow
he
went
on
you
a
angel
and
all
fixed
up
that
i
to
be
a
brother
to
you
whatever
other
relationships
i
may
be
engaged
in
i
must
try
and
get
to
work
and
earn
my
salt
by
making
you
happy
i
do
feel
as
if
i
could
ever
be
happy
again
i
told
him
the
world
seems
such
a
sad
place
to
be
in
i
see
what
i
can
do
anyhow
said
he
would
it
make
you
happier
if
van
buren
were
happier
oh
yes
i
exclaimed
he
been
so
kind
to
nell
and
me
but
i
afraid
nothing
can
be
done
an
unfortunate
marriage
for
a
young
man
of
of
an
affectionate
nature
is
such
a
tragedy
is
it
awful
but
it
may
never
come
off
i
do
see
what
to
prevent
it
i
said
and
the
memory
of
that
last
look
on
van
buren
face
came
up
so
vividly
that
tears
stood
in
my
eyes
i
thought
of
something
that
might
said
he
and
i
was
burning
to
know
what
when
the
door
opened
and
nell
came
in
without
her
coat
and
hat
she
eyed
starr
reproachfully
oh
you
promised
to
ask
robert
to
go
back
with
you
to
the
pier
she
said
has
he
gone
by
himself
i
do
starr
had
begun
guiltily
still
sitting
beside
me
on
the
sofa
when
her
cousin
appeared
on
the
threshold
he
was
very
pale
and
looked
so
grave
that
i
thought
some
bad
news
must
have
come
nell
thought
so
too
for
she
took
a
step
toward
him
as
he
paused
in
the
open
doorway
you
heard
nothing
she
stammered
poor
rudolph
he
began
but
at
the
sound
of
such
a
beginning
she
put
out
her
hands
as
if
to
ward
off
a
ghost
and
her
face
was
so
i
was
frightened
lest
she
was
going
to
faint
then
suddenly
it
changed
and
lit
up
i
never
saw
her
so
beautiful
as
she
was
at
that
moment
she
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
the
next
instant
our
handsome
brown
skipper
had
pushed
pass
van
buren
at
the
door
and
had
both
her
hands
in
his
he
was
dripping
with
water
even
his
hair
was
so
wet
that
i
saw
for
the
first
time
it
was
curly
oh
i
so
glad
so
glad
faltered
nell
robert
said
rudolph
and
i
thought
i
was
only
going
to
say
poor
rudolph
had
had
a
bad
night
of
it
broke
in
van
buren
but
i
do
think
either
of
them
heard
were
you
anxious
about
me
did
you
care
asked
jonkheer
brederode
that
seemed
to
call
nell
back
to
herself
i
was
anxious
about
she
said
you
brought
her
back
all
right
yes
and
he
answered
with
the
joy
gone
out
of
his
voice
we
had
rough
weather
to
fight
against
but
we
come
to
no
harm
he
turned
to
me
wistfully
had
you
a
thought
to
spare
for
the
skipper
once
or
twice
miss
rivers
i
was
so
grieved
for
him
that
before
i
knew
what
i
was
saying
i
exclaimed
why
i
thought
of
nothing
else
i
put
out
my
hand
to
him
and
he
shook
it
as
if
he
never
meant
to
let
it
go
how
good
you
are
he
said
warmly
and
i
did
dare
look
at
van
buren
for
the
idea
came
to
me
that
maybe
he
would
not
now
believe
what
i
had
told
him
a
little
while
ago
this
morning
i
scolded
nell
before
our
chaperon
for
her
coldness
to
jonkheer
brederode
when
he
had
done
so
much
for
her
how
could
you
i
asked
when
the
poor
fellow
seemed
so
pleased
to
think
you
cared
it
was
cruel
i
did
him
to
think
i
cared
nell
answered
dear
girl
you
were
quite
right
said
lady
macnairne
then
she
laughed
he
hoped
to
make
our
phil
jealous
i
suppose
for
his
thought
seems
to
have
been
for
does
it
neither
of
us
answered
i
quite
fancied
last
night
that
she
had
been
wrong
about
those
surmises
of
hers
but
now
when
she
put
it
in
this
way
i
was
so
sure
after
all
xxiv
nell
has
been
very
strange
for
the
last
few
days
but
singularly
lovable
to
everybody
except
jonkheer
brederode
and
to
him
she
has
never
been
the
same
for
ten
consecutive
minutes
perhaps
it
is
a
mercy
if
lady
macnairne
is
right
and
he
was
never
in
love
with
her
though
it
would
be
sad
if
he
thought
of
me
in
that
way
i
should
be
sorry
to
have
any
one
as
unhappy
as
i
now
am
it
a
good
thing
for
me
that
we
were
traveling
for
if
we
were
at
home
i
should
hardly
be
able
to
go
through
it
without
letting
nell
or
others
suspect
the
change
as
it
is
there
is
always
something
new
to
keep
my
thoughts
away
from
myself
and
other
people
of
whom
it
may
be
still
more
unwise
to
think
nell
avoided
jonkheer
brederode
as
much
as
she
could
the
morning
after
the
storm
she
said
that
as
he
took
no
interest
in
her
it
could
not
matter
what
she
did
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
she
was
quite
meek
and
subdued
when
she
answered
any
question
of
his
until
they
differed
about
something
it
was
about
urk
a
little
island
she
had
discovered
on
the
map
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
zuider
zee
when
she
heard
that
motor
had
been
injured
slightly
and
we
could
not
go
on
she
suggested
that
while
we
were
waiting
we
might
take
steamer
to
the
island
stop
all
night
and
come
back
to
enkhuisen
next
day
by
that
time
hendrik
our
chauffeur
would
have
repaired
the
damage
urk
is
worth
seeing
said
our
skipper
nell
asked
if
he
had
ever
been
there
no
he
replied
but
he
had
heard
that
it
was
a
dull
little
hole
and
it
would
be
far
better
to
stop
at
enkhuisen
till
next
morning
when
we
could
get
away
if
the
weather
changed
to
stavoren
there
nothing
to
do
in
enkhuisen
said
nell
no
said
he
but
there
be
less
in
urk
i
strongly
advise
you
not
to
go
that
decides
it
said
van
buren
who
was
stopping
on
for
a
day
or
two
at
once
nell
fired
up
not
at
all
said
she
no
one
who
does
want
to
need
go
but
those
who
do
will
all
favorably
inclined
hold
up
their
hands
up
went
starr
and
lady
macnairne
slowly
followed
his
example
whether
it
is
that
she
wishes
to
be
with
her
nephew
because
she
fond
of
him
or
whether
she
thinks
highly
of
her
duties
as
our
chaperon
anyway
she
generally
comes
with
us
if
he
does
i
hated
displeasing
van
buren
but
when
nell
said
phil
you
stick
by
me
wo
you
i
could
desert
her
especially
as
i
feel
that
for
some
reason
or
other
she
as
restless
and
unhappy
as
i
am
it
may
be
the
poor
conscience
that
troubles
her
but
i
sympathize
with
her
just
the
same
for
is
far
from
clear
i
have
such
hard
uncharitable
thoughts
toward
one
of
my
own
sex
one
perhaps
not
as
much
older
than
i
am
as
she
i
think
van
buren
was
torn
between
his
desire
to
stand
by
his
friend
who
said
he
must
stay
to
superintend
the
repairs
and
his
natural
wish
to
see
his
cousin
through
any
undertaking
no
matter
how
imprudent
he
went
on
trying
to
dissuade
nell
from
going
to
urk
but
the
more
he
talked
the
more
determined
she
grew
she
was
surprised
at
our
indifference
to
a
wonderful
pinhead
of
earth
which
had
contrived
to
stick
up
out
of
the
water
and
become
an
island
after
the
great
inundation
that
formed
the
zuider
zee
judging
from
the
population
was
quite
unspoiled
as
urk
was
too
remote
to
be
a
show
place
although
the
costumes
were
said
to
be
beautiful
such
a
spot
was
romance
itself
and
it
would
be
almost
a
crime
not
to
visit
it
the
steamer
would
leave
enkhuisen
after
luncheon
returning
next
day
so
we
must
stop
on
the
island
for
about
eighteen
hours
but
as
the
guides
mentioned
an
inn
it
would
be
as
simple
as
interesting
to
spend
a
night
at
the
idyllic
little
place
jonkheer
brederode
made
no
more
objections
after
the
first
and
finally
it
was
settled
that
all
of
us
should
go
except
our
skipper
and
van
buren
we
packed
small
bags
and
took
cameras
and
we
had
to
scramble
through
luncheon
to
catch
the
steamer
which
was
rather
a
horrid
one
apparently
being
intended
more
for
the
convenience
of
enormous
bales
sacks
and
than
that
of
its
passengers
who
were
stuffed
in
anyhow
among
the
cargo
lady
macnairne
was
furious
because
it
was
too
cold
for
tibe
on
deck
and
he
was
allowed
below
in
the
tiny
poky
cabin
she
argued
with
the
captain
or
somebody
in
authority
and
velvet
slippers
but
he
being
particularly
dutch
and
very
old
even
her
fascination
had
no
power
it
is
strange
but
when
lady
macnairne
gets
excited
she
talks
more
like
an
american
than
a
scotswoman
however
i
believe
she
has
been
to
the
states
at
last
we
all
three
formed
a
kind
of
hollow
square
round
tibe
with
our
skirts
over
his
back
and
when
he
was
asleep
he
amused
himself
by
pretending
that
our
shoes
were
bones
even
starr
could
not
keep
us
gay
and
laughing
for
the
whole
two
hours
of
the
trip
for
we
were
squeezed
in
between
bags
of
potatoes
he
sat
on
one
and
our
feet
kept
going
to
sleep
but
nell
said
think
of
urk
and
how
seeing
urk
would
make
up
for
everything
eventually
we
did
see
it
and
it
really
did
look
pretty
from
a
distance
with
its
little
red
roofs
like
a
buttonhole
bouquet
floating
on
the
sea
as
the
steamer
brought
us
nearer
the
island
something
of
the
glamor
faded
but
there
were
about
a
dozen
girls
assembled
to
watch
the
arrival
of
the
boat
wearing
rather
nice
winged
white
caps
and
black
dresses
quickly
we
made
our
cameras
ready
expecting
them
to
smile
shyly
and
seem
pleased
as
at
volendam
but
with
one
accord
they
sneered
and
turned
their
backs
as
if
on
a
word
of
command
we
snapped
nothing
but
a
row
of
sunburnt
necks
under
the
caps
the
girls
laughed
scornfully
and
when
we
landed
they
repaid
our
first
interest
in
them
by
staring
at
us
with
impudent
contempt
there
was
no
one
to
carry
our
bags
so
we
had
to
do
it
ourselves
starr
taking
all
he
could
manage
and
as
we
trailed
off
to
find
the
hotel
about
forty
or
fifty
ugly
and
people
followed
after
us
jeering
and
evidently
making
the
most
personal
remarks
nobody
could
or
would
tell
us
where
to
find
the
inn
but
it
was
close
by
really
as
we
presently
found
out
for
ourselves
after
we
had
gone
the
wrong
way
once
or
twice
perhaps
it
was
strange
though
that
we
missed
it
for
it
was
a
shabby
little
house
with
no
resemblance
to
a
hotel
and
when
we
went
in
the
landlord
who
was
cleaning
lamps
and
in
a
scene
of
great
disorder
in
the
principal
room
showed
signs
of
bewildered
surprise
at
sight
of
us
but
he
was
a
great
deal
more
surprised
when
he
heard
that
we
wished
to
stay
the
night
he
had
not
many
rooms
he
said
and
people
seldom
asked
for
them
indeed
no
tourist
had
ever
done
so
before
within
his
experience
still
he
would
do
his
best
for
us
and
yes
we
could
see
the
rooms
he
dropped
his
and
on
the
floor
and
opening
a
door
started
to
go
up
a
ladder
which
led
to
a
square
hole
in
the
floor
above
we
followed
all
but
lady
macnairne
who
would
not
go
because
tibe
could
not
and
at
the
top
of
the
hole
were
two
little
boxes
of
rooms
with
beds
in
the
wall
stuffy
unmade
beds
which
perhaps
the
landlord
and
some
members
of
the
family
had
slept
in
this
is
going
to
be
an
adventure
said
nell
but
her
voice
did
not
sound
very
cheerful
and
i
felt
i
could
have
cried
when
i
heard
that
she
and
i
would
have
to
bunk
together
in
the
wall
in
a
wide
bed
smelling
like
wet
moss
we
were
dying
for
tea
or
even
coffee
but
it
seemed
useless
to
ask
for
it
as
apparently
there
were
no
servants
and
the
landlord
went
back
to
his
cleaning
the
instant
we
had
scrambled
down
the
ladder
perhaps
said
i
we
can
find
a
if
we
go
out
and
explore
so
we
went
followed
by
beggars
for
the
first
time
in
holland
and
it
was
a
hideous
island
with
no
sign
of
a
or
anything
else
nice
or
even
clean
all
was
as
unlike
as
possible
to
the
ideas
we
had
formed
of
the
dear
little
hollow
land
there
were
dead
cats
and
bad
eggs
and
old
bones
lying
about
the
oozy
gutters
and
people
shouted
disagreeable
things
at
us
from
their
doorways
starr
tried
to
be
merry
but
it
was
as
difficult
even
for
him
as
making
jokes
in
the
tumbril
on
the
way
to
have
your
head
cut
off
and
lady
macnairne
said
at
last
that
she
would
much
rather
have
hers
cut
off
than
stay
seventeen
more
hours
in
such
a
ghastly
hole
i
simply
ca
and
wo
and
you
sha
either
she
exclaimed
we
been
here
an
hour
and
it
seems
a
month
somehow
we
must
get
away
poor
nell
was
sadly
crushed
she
admitted
that
she
had
made
a
horrible
mistake
which
she
regretted
more
for
our
sakes
than
her
own
though
she
herself
was
so
bored
that
she
felt
a
decrepit
wreck
a
hundred
years
old
but
the
steamer
does
come
back
till
eight
or
nine
morning
i
afraid
we
have
to
grin
and
bear
it
till
then
said
starr
i
ca
grin
and
i
wo
bear
it
replied
lady
macnairne
dearest
ronny
you
are
a
man
and
we
look
to
you
to
get
us
away
from
here
poor
starr
stared
wildly
out
to
sea
as
if
he
would
call
a
bark
of
some
sort
from
the
vasty
deep
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
except
an
endless
expanse
of
gray
water
nell
had
torn
her
dress
on
a
fence
which
shut
us
away
from
the
only
spot
of
green
on
the
hideous
island
tibe
had
unfortunately
eaten
part
of
what
starr
said
was
an
early
christian
egg
i
had
wrenched
my
ankle
badly
on
a
bit
of
banana
peel
lady
macnairne
smart
coat
was
spoilt
by
some
mud
which
a
small
urkian
boy
had
thrown
at
her
and
starr
must
have
felt
that
if
he
did
instantly
perform
a
miracle
he
would
be
blamed
by
us
all
for
everything
we
might
get
a
he
said
when
he
had
thought
passionately
for
a
few
minutes
we
snapped
at
the
idea
and
a
moment
later
we
were
on
our
way
to
the
harbor
to
find
out
now
was
the
time
that
i
became
a
person
of
importance
owing
to
my
studies
in
which
van
buren
has
encouraged
me
so
kindly
i
know
enough
dutch
to
ask
for
most
things
i
want
and
to
understand
whether
people
mean
to
let
me
have
them
or
not
which
seems
odd
considering
that
i
deliberately
made
up
my
mind
not
to
learn
a
word
when
nell
almost
dragged
me
to
holland
under
starr
guidance
and
at
his
dictation
i
interviewed
every
sailor
we
met
lounging
about
the
harbor
it
was
very
discouraging
at
first
the
men
were
all
sure
that
no
could
get
to
enkhuisen
as
the
wind
was
exactly
in
the
wrong
quarter
but
just
as
our
hearts
were
on
their
way
down
to
the
boots
tibe
had
gnawed
so
much
a
brown
young
man
with
crisp
black
curls
and
said
we
could
go
to
kampen
if
we
liked
it
would
take
four
or
five
hours
and
we
should
have
to
sleep
there
taking
the
steamer
when
it
started
back
in
the
morning
kampen
was
beautiful
he
told
us
with
old
buildings
and
but
even
if
it
had
been
we
were
convinced
that
it
must
be
better
than
urk
so
we
joyously
engaged
a
large
owned
by
the
brown
man
and
his
still
browner
father
we
made
poor
starr
go
back
alone
to
the
inn
and
break
it
to
the
landlord
that
we
were
not
going
to
stay
after
all
but
he
paid
for
the
rooms
so
the
old
man
was
delighted
that
he
could
go
on
with
his
cleaning
in
peace
now
we
began
to
be
quite
happy
and
excited
starr
brought
us
bread
and
cheese
from
the
inn
to
eat
on
board
and
presently
we
were
all
packed
away
in
the
which
smelt
interestingly
of
ropes
and
tar
nell
and
i
sat
on
the
floor
where
we
could
feel
as
well
as
hear
the
knocking
of
the
little
waves
against
the
planks
which
alone
separated
us
from
the
water
there
was
not
much
breeze
to
begin
with
for
the
winds
seemed
to
be
resting
after
their
orgy
of
yesterday
and
just
as
the
old
bronze
statue
and
the
young
bronze
statue
were
ready
to
start
the
little
there
was
died
as
if
of
exhaustion
there
we
sat
and
waited
our
muscles
involuntarily
straining
as
if
to
help
the
boat
along
but
the
sail
flapped
idly
we
might
as
well
have
tried
to
sail
on
the
waxed
floor
of
a
ballroom
with
the
windows
shut
ca
they
do
asked
lady
macnairne
in
growing
despair
i
passed
the
question
on
but
the
men
shook
their
heads
without
some
faint
breeze
to
help
them
along
they
could
not
move
when
half
an
hour
had
dragged
itself
away
and
still
the
air
was
dead
or
fast
asleep
starr
said
that
urk
had
stifled
it
we
began
to
realize
the
fate
to
which
we
were
doomed
we
would
either
have
to
spend
the
night
curled
up
among
coils
of
rope
with
no
shelter
except
a
windowless
furnitureless
cupboard
of
four
feet
by
three
which
maybe
called
itself
a
cabin
or
we
would
have
to
crawl
humbly
back
to
the
inn
and
sue
for
a
night
lodging
we
were
hungry
and
cross
a
little
tired
and
very
very
hot
it
would
have
been
a
great
relief
to
burst
into
tears
or
be
disagreeable
to
some
one
i
do
know
why
but
i
had
the
most
homesick
longing
to
see
van
buren
it
seemed
as
if
had
he
come
with
us
everything
would
have
been
right
or
at
least
bearable
suddenly
as
we
were
dismally
trying
to
make
up
our
minds
what
to
do
and
starr
had
proposed
to
toss
a
coin
lady
macnairne
pointed
wildly
out
to
sea
crying
look
there
look
there
a
dot
of
a
thing
was
tearing
over
the
water
a
dot
of
a
thing
like
our
own
darling
blessed
and
the
nearer
it
came
the
more
like
it
was
at
last
there
was
no
room
for
doubt
was
speeding
to
our
rescue
across
the
zuider
zee
all
alone
without
fat
waddling
waterspin
i
do
believe
if
i
heard
that
some
one
had
made
me
a
present
of
the
tower
of
london
with
everything
in
it
i
should
have
been
as
distracted
with
joy
as
i
was
now
for
the
tower
could
have
got
us
away
from
urk
and
could
besides
van
buren
would
probably
not
have
been
in
the
tower
whereas
intuition
told
me
that
he
was
coming
to
me
that
is
to
us
as
fast
as
mascotte
motor
could
bring
him
we
stood
up
and
waved
and
shouted
i
hardly
know
what
other
absurd
things
we
may
not
have
done
in
our
delirium
of
joy
as
i
said
to
van
buren
a
few
minutes
later
it
was
exactly
like
being
rescued
from
a
desert
island
when
your
food
had
just
given
out
and
you
thought
savages
were
going
to
kill
you
in
the
night
jonkheer
brederode
was
almost
superhumanly
nice
considering
what
he
had
endured
at
nell
hands
and
that
it
was
really
through
her
obstinacy
that
we
suffered
so
much
and
made
ourselves
and
everybody
else
concerned
so
much
trouble
van
buren
said
for
his
part
he
would
have
tried
to
persuade
his
friend
to
punish
nell
by
leaving
her
to
her
fate
if
he
had
been
sorry
to
have
it
involve
me
and
of
course
the
others
when
jonkheer
brederode
found
that
by
ferociously
hard
work
on
his
part
and
hendrik
the
damage
could
be
repaired
sooner
than
he
had
expected
he
at
once
proposed
following
us
to
urk
he
knew
what
it
was
like
and
how
within
a
few
minutes
after
landing
we
would
hate
it
he
was
certain
that
we
would
be
in
despair
at
being
tied
to
the
wretched
island
for
the
night
and
he
had
proposed
to
go
to
our
succor
the
lack
of
wind
which
had
meant
ruin
to
our
hopes
was
a
boon
to
the
which
had
flown
along
the
smooth
water
at
her
best
speed
and
when
mascotte
was
received
by
us
with
acclamations
our
noble
skipper
did
not
even
smile
a
superior
smile
he
only
said
that
when
he
found
he
could
he
thought
he
might
as
well
follow
and
spin
us
back
if
we
liked
to
go
and
he
hoped
miss
van
buren
would
pardon
the
liberty
he
had
taken
with
her
boat
if
she
had
been
horrid
to
him
then
i
do
believe
i
should
have
slapped
her
but
she
had
the
grace
to
laugh
and
say
that
mascotte
really
was
a
mascot
there
is
something
i
suppose
in
having
a
sense
of
humor
in
which
i
alleged
to
be
deficient
xxv
that
was
the
way
it
happened
that
we
had
two
nights
at
enkhuisen
but
the
second
we
spent
on
and
waterspin
sleeping
on
the
boats
for
the
first
time
and
it
was
great
fun
the
next
morning
early
we
had
a
picnic
breakfast
on
board
making
coffee
with
the
grand
apparatus
in
starr
wonderful
which
he
had
bought
at
the
most
expensive
shop
in
london
like
the
extravagant
young
man
he
is
we
did
wait
to
finish
before
we
were
off
and
then
came
the
trip
to
stavoren
which
jonkheer
brederode
would
not
have
let
us
make
on
the
boat
if
the
weather
had
not
been
calm
for
once
more
we
had
to
steer
straight
across
the
zuider
zee
for
several
hours
when
we
had
arrived
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
stavoren
had
once
been
a
place
of
vast
importance
and
that
a
powerful
king
had
lived
there
in
old
old
days
for
the
bastion
seemed
the
only
thing
of
importance
in
the
poor
little
town
now
but
no
doubt
the
great
with
its
famous
legend
of
the
proud
lady
is
enough
to
account
for
the
decline
nell
smiled
in
a
naughty
mischievous
way
when
her
cousin
remarked
that
his
mother
family
came
originally
from
friesland
i
suppose
because
jonkheer
brederode
had
just
told
us
that
the
frisian
people
are
the
most
obstinate
and
persistent
in
the
netherlands
that
all
the
obstinacy
in
any
other
whole
province
would
not
be
as
much
as
is
contained
in
one
frisian
man
or
woman
but
i
think
they
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
themselves
especially
as
their
obstinacy
has
kept
their
ancient
customs
and
language
almost
intact
and
the
spaniards
never
could
make
the
least
impression
upon
them
by
the
most
original
and
terrific
kinds
of
tortures
invented
especially
to
subdue
frisians
if
they
were
buried
alive
they
just
went
on
smiling
and
saying
i
will
or
i
wo
until
their
mouths
were
covered
up
i
almost
wished
that
jonkheer
brederode
had
said
before
van
buren
that
a
frisian
head
is
an
expression
used
by
the
dutch
when
they
mean
incredible
hardness
or
obstinacy
but
he
did
mind
at
all
and
immediately
told
us
a
thing
that
happened
to
his
mother
and
some
frisian
cousins
of
hers
when
they
were
girls
a
musical
genius
a
young
man
was
visiting
at
their
house
and
when
he
had
played
a
great
deal
for
them
at
their
request
he
made
a
bet
that
they
would
tire
of
hearing
his
music
before
he
tired
of
making
it
they
took
the
bet
and
he
began
to
play
again
but
he
was
not
frisian
and
had
never
been
in
friesland
before
therefore
he
was
not
prepared
for
what
would
happen
still
he
was
dutch
so
he
did
not
like
giving
up
and
he
went
on
playing
for
hours
without
stopping
for
more
than
five
minutes
at
a
time
the
ladies
always
exclaimed
please
go
on
if
you
can
we
not
tired
at
all
though
they
looked
very
pale
and
ill
so
he
did
stop
until
he
tumbled
off
his
and
had
to
be
carried
away
to
bed
where
he
lay
for
two
days
but
the
frisian
girls
suffered
no
bad
consequences
and
said
if
he
had
not
given
up
they
would
have
sat
listening
for
at
least
a
week
once
jonkheer
brederode
had
a
big
yacht
which
he
lent
to
the
belgian
king
for
a
trip
and
there
was
a
frisian
skipper
every
morning
the
decks
were
washed
at
five
and
the
king
sent
word
that
he
would
be
glad
to
have
it
done
later
in
the
day
as
it
waked
him
up
and
he
could
not
go
to
sleep
again
then
the
frisian
answered
very
sorry
king
but
we
always
do
wash
the
decks
at
five
and
it
must
be
done
which
amused
his
majesty
so
much
that
he
made
no
more
objections
if
the
people
of
friesland
have
great
individuality
so
have
their
meers
there
was
a
canal
through
which
we
had
to
pass
after
stavoren
like
a
long
corridor
leading
into
a
huge
room
the
green
wall
was
made
of
tall
reeds
and
we
had
glimpses
of
level
golden
spaces
and
sails
which
seemed
to
be
skimming
through
meadows
there
was
a
crying
of
gulls
a
smell
of
salt
and
of
peat
which
once
formed
the
great
forests
swallowed
up
by
the
meer
then
through
a
kind
of
we
slipped
into
our
first
frisian
meer
where
the
water
was
like
glass
the
black
sails
of
yellow
were
purple
in
the
sunlight
and
the
windmills
on
the
distant
shore
looked
like
restless
gesticulating
ghosts
our
wash
raised
a
golden
wave
but
the
water
was
so
clear
that
now
and
then
we
fancied
we
could
faintly
see
the
old
road
under
the
meer
which
they
say
frisian
farmers
use
to
this
day
knowing
just
where
and
how
to
guide
their
horses
along
it
through
the
water
because
of
this
road
and
others
like
it
jonkheer
brederode
had
taken
on
a
pilot
at
stavoren
a
man
able
to
keep
us
off
all
hidden
perils
he
seemed
to
know
every
person
on
every
or
brightly
painted
and
nell
insisted
that
even
the
families
of
wild
ducks
we
met
nodded
to
him
as
we
went
by
we
passed
from
the
meer
called
morra
into
the
biggest
in
all
friesland
fluessen
meer
and
it
was
all
rather
like
the
norfolk
broads
where
my
father
once
took
me
when
i
was
a
child
always
going
from
one
meer
into
another
there
were
charming
canals
decorated
with
pretty
little
houses
in
gardens
of
roses
and
hollyhocks
and
emphasized
somehow
by
strange
windmills
exactly
like
large
wise
gray
owls
or
in
the
distance
resembling
monks
bearing
aloft
tall
crosses
it
was
exquisite
to
glide
on
and
on
between
two
worlds
the
world
of
realities
the
world
of
reflections
villages
were
far
separated
one
from
another
on
canal
and
meer
though
there
were
many
farmhouses
walled
round
by
great
trees
to
keep
cool
the
in
their
roofs
gulls
sat
about
like
domestic
fowls
and
perched
on
the
backs
of
cows
that
grazed
in
meadows
fringed
with
pink
and
purple
flowers
men
and
girls
rowed
home
from
milking
and
hung
their
green
and
scarlet
in
rows
on
the
outer
walls
of
their
farmhouse
homes
were
looped
from
pole
to
pole
by
the
in
such
curious
fashion
as
to
look
like
vineyards
of
trailing
brown
vines
and
as
we
drew
near
to
sneek
where
we
planned
to
stay
the
night
we
began
to
meet
quaint
lighters
with
much
picturesque
family
life
going
on
on
board
children
playing
with
queer
homemade
toys
ancient
dames
knitting
girls
flirting
with
young
men
on
passing
men
in
scarlet
jerseys
which
repeated
in
the
smooth
water
looked
like
running
fire
under
glass
the
old
at
sneek
was
so
beautiful
that
we
expected
to
like
the
place
with
the
ugly
name
but
after
all
we
hated
it
and
decided
to
spend
another
night
in
our
own
floating
houses
all
sorts
of
funny
waked
me
early
but
then
i
slept
very
soundly
because
i
could
help
thinking
a
good
deal
about
van
buren
who
found
a
telegram
waiting
for
him
at
sneek
and
went
away
from
us
by
the
first
train
he
could
catch
i
do
know
what
was
in
the
telegram
but
he
looked
rather
miserable
as
he
read
it
and
i
wondered
a
good
deal
in
the
night
if
his
mother
had
called
him
back
because
freule
menela
van
der
windt
was
not
pleased
at
having
him
stay
so
long
with
us
nell
thought
our
next
day
run
going
through
the
river
boorn
to
the
sneeker
meer
past
grouw
and
on
to
leeuwarden
even
more
delightful
than
the
day
before
but
it
did
seem
as
interesting
to
me
somehow
perhaps
it
was
having
a
person
who
was
partly
frisian
standing
by
me
all
the
time
and
telling
me
things
which
made
the
difference
anyway
i
had
a
homesick
feeling
as
if
something
were
lacking
starr
said
it
would
be
nice
to
spend
a
honeymoon
on
board
one
of
the
nice
little
wherries
we
saw
in
the
big
meer
but
i
thought
of
van
buren
and
freule
menela
having
theirs
on
one
and
it
gave
me
quite
a
sinking
of
the
heart
i
tried
not
to
show
that
i
was
sad
but
i
afraid
starr
guessed
for
in
the
afternoon
he
gave
me
a
sketch
he
had
made
in
the
morning
on
deck
he
called
it
a
rough
impressionist
thing
but
it
is
really
exquisite
the
water
pale
lilac
with
silver
frills
of
foam
just
as
it
looked
in
the
light
when
he
sat
painting
fields
of
starred
with
wild
flowers
in
the
foreground
trees
in
soft
gray
and
violet
with
a
gleam
of
rose
here
and
there
which
means
a
half
hidden
in
the
middle
distance
lady
macnairne
admired
the
sketch
particularly
and
i
got
the
idea
i
hardly
know
why
that
she
was
not
quite
pleased
to
have
it
given
to
me
instead
of
to
her
xxvi
it
was
late
afternoon
when
we
came
to
leeuwarden
and
the
first
thing
we
found
out
was
that
it
was
not
at
all
a
place
where
we
should
enjoy
stopping
on
the
boats
because
of
a
very
ancient
and
very
very
smell
which
pervaded
the
canal
and
made
us
wear
extraordinary
expressions
on
our
faces
as
it
found
its
way
to
our
nostrils
but
nobody
else
seemed
even
to
notice
it
nobody
else
wore
agonized
expressions
indeed
the
girls
we
met
as
we
drove
to
the
hotel
had
smiling
faces
they
were
tall
and
radiantly
fair
with
peace
in
their
eyes
and
those
who
still
kept
to
the
fashion
of
wearing
gold
and
silver
were
like
noble
young
minervas
i
could
have
scolded
the
ones
who
were
silly
enough
to
wear
modern
hats
but
all
the
old
ladies
were
most
satisfactory
we
did
meet
one
who
had
not
been
loyal
to
the
helmet
of
her
youth
and
they
were
such
beautiful
old
creatures
that
i
could
well
believe
the
legend
jonkheer
brederode
told
us
how
the
sirens
of
the
north
sea
had
wedded
frisian
men
and
all
the
had
been
as
magically
lovely
as
their
mothers
the
rather
dull
streets
were
crowded
with
people
who
seemed
in
more
of
a
hurry
to
get
somewhere
than
they
need
have
been
in
such
a
sleepy
town
and
when
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
all
was
excitement
and
bustle
it
happened
that
we
had
come
in
the
midst
of
kermess
week
the
greatest
event
of
the
year
at
leeuwarden
and
if
a
party
of
americans
had
not
gone
away
unexpectedly
that
morning
they
could
not
have
given
us
rooms
though
jonkheer
brederode
had
telegraphed
from
sneek
as
soon
as
we
were
settled
though
it
was
nearly
he
proposed
that
we
should
dart
out
and
have
a
look
round
the
fair
because
he
said
ladies
must
not
go
at
night
why
not
asked
nell
quick
as
usual
to
take
him
up
if
he
seems
inclined
to
be
masterful
i
should
think
it
would
be
more
amusing
at
night
so
it
is
he
admitted
calmly
then
why
are
we
to
see
it
because
the
play
is
too
rough
tom
dick
and
harry
as
you
say
in
england
come
out
after
dark
when
the
fair
lighted
up
and
at
its
gayest
and
it
is
no
place
for
ladies
to
be
hustled
about
in
i
always
found
dick
and
harry
very
inoffensive
fellows
nell
persisted
you
never
been
to
a
dutch
kermess
that
why
i
want
to
go
so
you
shall
before
dark
and
after
dark
too
she
added
as
obstinately
as
if
she
had
been
a
frisian
that
is
impossible
said
jonkheer
brederode
his
mouth
and
chin
looking
hard
and
firm
nell
did
say
any
more
though
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
the
expression
of
her
eyes
was
ominous
and
i
felt
that
she
was
planning
mischief
we
walked
out
to
the
kermess
which
lady
macnairne
and
starr
pronounced
very
like
a
french
country
fair
but
it
seemed
wonderful
to
me
there
were
streets
and
streets
of
booths
little
and
big
gorgeously
decorated
where
people
in
the
costumes
of
their
provinces
sold
every
imaginable
kind
of
thing
nell
was
so
that
she
evidently
disarmed
jonkheer
brederode
suspicions
if
he
had
shared
mine
and
when
she
proposed
buying
a
quantity
of
sweets
and
cheap
toys
for
us
to
give
away
to
families
of
children
upon
the
lighters
we
passed
on
canals
he
was
ready
to
humor
her
we
chose
all
sorts
of
toys
and
sweets
enough
to
last
us
for
days
of
playing
santa
claus
and
bargained
in
dutch
with
the
people
who
sold
making
them
laugh
sometimes
then
jonkheer
brederode
took
us
to
all
the
best
the
giant
steer
as
big
as
sixteen
oxen
the
smallest
horse
in
the
world
a
fairy
beast
thoughtfully
doing
sums
in
the
sand
with
his
miniature
forepaw
the
fat
lady
very
bored
and
warm
the
fair
circassian
who
lured
audiences
into
a
hot
theater
with
tinsel
decorations
like
a
and
hundreds
of
colored
lights
there
were
other
sights
but
jonkheer
brederode
said
these
were
the
only
ones
for
ladies
and
hurried
us
by
some
of
the
booths
with
painted
pictures
of
people
or
girls
cut
off
at
the
waist
which
nell
wished
particularly
to
see
he
would
let
us
go
into
the
either
and
by
the
time
we
got
back
to
the
hotel
our
hands
full
of
dolls
tops
spotted
wooden
horses
boxes
of
blocks
and
packets
of
nougat
surmounted
with
chenille
monkeys
she
was
boiling
with
resentment
already
we
were
late
for
dinner
and
we
still
had
to
dress
but
nell
who
shared
a
room
with
me
as
the
hotel
was
crowded
said
that
she
must
slip
out
again
to
buy
something
which
she
wished
to
select
when
alone
she
would
not
be
gone
many
minutes
i
was
all
ready
when
she
ran
in
again
with
two
large
bundles
in
her
hands
she
would
not
tell
me
what
they
were
as
she
was
in
a
hurry
to
change
at
least
that
was
her
excuse
but
promised
that
i
should
see
something
interesting
if
i
would
come
up
to
the
room
with
her
after
dining
and
i
was
not
to
tell
any
one
that
she
had
been
out
for
the
second
time
we
were
long
over
our
dinner
as
there
was
such
a
crowd
that
the
waiters
grew
quite
confused
and
at
the
end
we
three
women
sat
with
jonkheer
brederode
and
starr
in
the
garden
behind
the
hotel
while
the
men
smoked
nell
was
so
patient
that
i
almost
thought
she
had
forgotten
the
bundles
but
at
last
lady
macnairne
hearing
a
clock
chime
ten
announced
that
she
had
some
writing
to
do
before
going
to
bed
i
suppose
you
will
have
a
look
at
the
kermess
again
she
said
to
our
two
knights
i
seen
dozens
of
such
fairs
and
when
you
seen
one
you
seen
pretty
well
all
nowadays
but
if
the
mariner
would
like
to
go
i
shall
be
glad
to
go
with
him
jonkheer
brederode
answered
i
not
sure
i
did
see
enough
this
afternoon
said
starr
anyhow
i
mean
to
have
another
cigarette
or
two
here
and
i
do
think
the
ladies
might
stop
with
me
for
i
have
a
hundred
things
to
say
lady
macnairne
and
nell
were
on
their
feet
however
and
would
not
be
persuaded
so
we
bade
each
other
and
three
minutes
later
nell
was
opening
her
parcels
in
our
room
among
the
last
letters
that
were
forwarded
from
london
was
a
larger
check
than
i
expected
from
the
said
she
so
bought
a
present
for
you
and
for
me
from
my
affectionate
self
with
that
she
had
the
paper
wrappings
off
two
glittering
frisian
like
beautiful
gold
and
in
the
other
bundle
were
two
black
shawls
like
those
i
had
seen
several
girls
of
leeuwarden
wearing
oh
how
sweet
i
exclaimed
thank
you
so
much
i
been
wanting
some
kind
of
costume
ever
since
amsterdam
where
they
were
so
expensive
these
are
to
take
home
and
keep
as
souvenirs
when
we
are
at
work
in
our
poor
little
flat
just
as
if
nothing
had
ever
happened
to
us
nell
gave
a
shudder
but
she
did
say
that
we
never
would
go
home
and
to
work
again
as
she
used
to
say
if
i
spoke
of
it
when
we
were
beginning
our
trip
instead
she
said
i
do
know
about
the
future
but
i
going
to
wear
mine
what
sleep
in
that
helmet
i
asked
she
laughed
i
not
thinking
about
sleep
yet
it
just
the
edge
of
the
evening
in
kermess
week
watch
me
she
undid
her
hair
which
is
very
long
and
thick
and
seems
even
thicker
than
it
is
if
possible
because
it
is
so
wavy
then
she
plaited
it
tightly
into
two
braids
and
straining
and
pulling
and
pushing
the
little
ripples
and
rings
back
from
her
face
as
well
as
she
could
she
managed
to
put
on
the
helmet
then
she
tied
the
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
as
she
had
on
a
short
dark
skirt
which
was
unnoticeable
she
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
beautiful
frisian
girl
illustration
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
beautiful
frisian
i
told
her
this
and
she
said
will
you
be
a
frisian
girl
too
and
come
out
with
me
to
see
the
kermess
at
the
time
when
it
worth
seeing
i
was
dreadfully
startled
and
of
course
said
no
i
had
never
done
anything
in
disguise
and
i
never
would
very
well
then
said
nell
i
go
alone
i
tried
to
dissuade
her
but
she
did
not
object
to
shocking
jonkheer
brederode
it
would
do
him
good
she
said
only
he
wo
have
the
chance
this
time
because
no
one
would
ever
recognize
me
would
they
i
looked
hard
at
her
and
was
not
quite
sure
though
the
pushing
back
of
the
hair
and
the
wearing
of
the
helmet
did
change
her
wonderfully
to
say
nothing
of
the
shawl
but
she
looked
far
too
beautiful
to
go
out
alone
in
the
night
the
golden
gave
her
hair
the
color
of
copper
beech
leaves
and
the
gleam
of
the
metal
so
close
to
the
face
made
her
complexion
transparent
as
if
a
light
were
shining
through
a
thin
sheet
of
when
i
found
that
she
was
determined
i
told
her
that
i
would
go
rather
than
she
should
run
the
risk
alone
but
she
only
laughed
and
said
there
was
no
risk
even
if
our
skipper
were
right
about
foreigners
surely
two
frisian
girls
of
the
lower
classes
might
walk
about
at
the
fair
when
the
best
fun
was
going
on
we
should
find
plenty
of
others
exactly
like
ourselves
and
when
i
tried
the
helmet
on
before
the
mirror
i
could
not
resist
wishing
that
van
buren
might
have
seen
it
simply
to
amuse
him
of
course
the
next
thing
was
to
steal
without
being
seen
we
wrapped
our
shawls
over
our
heads
helmets
and
all
but
we
need
not
have
feared
every
one
was
away
at
some
entertainment
or
other
and
we
did
not
meet
a
soul
once
outside
the
hotel
we
rearranged
the
shawls
crossing
the
ends
behind
our
waists
and
nell
said
that
it
did
not
matter
if
we
met
the
whole
world
now
as
we
should
not
have
to
open
our
mouths
to
any
one
and
betray
our
ignorance
of
dutch
there
would
be
nothing
to
show
that
we
were
not
frisian
girls
the
full
moon
was
just
coming
up
as
we
left
the
hotel
but
when
we
had
turned
two
or
three
corners
and
reached
the
streets
where
the
kermess
was
going
on
there
was
such
a
white
blaze
of
electricity
that
the
moon
and
her
pale
light
were
swallowed
up
in
the
dazzling
illumination
the
booths
and
and
carousels
with
their
sparkling
decorations
of
tinsel
seemed
to
drip
gold
and
silver
and
the
garlands
and
trees
and
fountains
of
electric
light
scintillated
like
myriads
of
diamonds
there
had
been
crowds
in
the
afternoon
but
now
they
were
five
times
as
dense
the
brilliant
were
crammed
and
the
band
in
each
one
was
playing
a
different
air
everybody
was
laughing
and
shouting
and
singing
the
people
had
thrown
away
their
dutch
reserve
and
even
men
and
women
were
enjoying
themselves
like
children
i
felt
and
guilty
at
first
but
it
was
such
a
gay
scene
that
nobody
could
help
getting
into
the
spirit
of
it
and
just
as
nell
had
prophesied
there
were
plenty
of
frisian
girls
about
in
gold
or
silver
helmets
like
ours
only
nobody
stared
at
them
particularly
and
everybody
did
stare
at
us
i
remarked
this
to
nell
and
the
fact
that
no
shawls
of
our
sort
were
being
worn
but
she
laughed
and
said
that
if
people
stared
we
might
as
well
take
it
as
a
compliment
she
flattered
herself
that
we
happened
to
be
looking
our
best
it
really
was
fun
we
dared
not
buy
anything
on
account
of
our
foreign
accent
but
we
wandered
from
street
to
street
jostled
by
the
crowd
stopping
in
front
of
the
gayest
booths
and
even
going
into
a
where
a
javanese
man
was
having
fits
to
please
the
audience
jonkheer
brederode
had
refused
to
take
us
in
the
afternoon
when
we
had
shown
an
interest
in
the
painting
which
advertised
the
javanese
creature
but
after
all
the
fits
were
more
exciting
on
canvas
than
they
were
inside
the
hot
crowded
tent
and
some
young
soldiers
stared
at
us
so
much
that
we
were
glad
to
get
out
next
door
was
the
most
gorgeous
i
ever
saw
it
was
spinning
round
under
a
red
plush
roof
embroidered
with
gold
and
sparkling
crystals
and
festooned
with
silver
chains
to
the
strains
of
the
dutch
national
air
elephants
with
gilded
castles
huge
giraffes
alarming
lions
terrific
tigers
beautiful
swans
and
sedan
chairs
were
whirling
madly
with
great
effect
of
glitter
and
gaiety
all
my
life
i
wanted
to
ride
in
a
said
nell
and
i
never
have
now
our
one
chance
there
a
spanish
bull
and
a
polar
bear
to
let
come
on
she
seized
my
hand
and
before
i
realized
what
we
were
doing
i
was
sitting
on
a
large
bull
wildly
clinging
to
its
horns
while
nell
just
in
front
perched
on
the
back
of
a
white
bear
no
sooner
were
we
settled
than
the
four
young
soldiers
who
had
stared
in
the
tent
jumped
on
some
other
animals
in
the
procession
and
as
we
began
to
fly
round
the
big
ring
they
called
out
and
waved
their
hands
as
if
they
were
friends
of
ours
i
was
afraid
they
must
have
followed
us
out
of
the
tent
and
i
could
understand
enough
dutch
to
know
that
they
were
saying
things
about
our
looks
every
one
in
the
crowd
laughed
and
encouraged
them
and
several
people
standing
by
to
watch
spoke
to
nell
and
me
as
we
whirled
it
was
an
awful
situation
what
with
the
embarrassment
the
shame
the
horrid
consciousness
of
being
part
of
the
show
and
the
giddiness
that
came
over
me
with
the
motion
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
crying
but
if
i
had
sobbed
while
spinning
round
the
ring
on
the
back
of
a
bull
i
should
have
been
a
more
conspicuous
figure
than
ever
so
i
controlled
myself
with
all
my
might
oh
if
only
i
could
have
got
down
to
run
away
and
hide
but
there
we
both
had
to
sit
till
time
for
the
to
stop
and
i
would
have
given
all
that
left
of
the
two
hundred
pounds
captain
noble
willed
me
to
make
the
horrid
machinery
break
down
as
we
sailed
round
and
round
my
agonized
eyes
caught
the
surprised
gaze
of
a
man
i
knew
for
an
instant
i
could
not
remember
how
or
where
or
how
much
i
knew
him
but
suddenly
it
all
came
back
i
recognized
sir
alexander
macnairne
whose
acquaintance
we
made
in
amsterdam
through
tibe
and
the
worst
thing
was
that
from
the
expression
of
his
face
i
was
almost
sure
he
recognized
us
both
in
spite
of
our
disguise
by
this
time
the
sitting
on
the
bull
and
the
continued
whirling
at
the
mercy
of
a
thousand
eyes
began
to
seem
a
torture
such
as
might
have
been
inflicted
by
the
inquisition
if
you
had
argued
with
them
about
some
little
thing
i
sure
if
any
one
had
sprung
forward
at
this
moment
to
tell
me
that
if
i
would
become
a
dissenter
of
any
kind
or
belong
to
the
salvation
army
i
need
be
a
martyr
any
longer
but
should
be
saved
at
once
i
would
have
screamed
yes
yes
at
last
the
animals
did
slow
down
and
nell
and
i
slid
off
our
monsters
before
they
had
stopped
but
instead
of
improving
our
situation
we
had
made
it
worse
while
we
had
been
sailing
round
the
ring
no
one
could
approach
disagreeably
near
the
minute
we
tried
to
mingle
with
the
crowd
and
disappear
in
it
however
the
impudent
young
soldiers
mingled
too
having
the
evident
intention
of
disappearing
with
us
the
things
that
happened
next
happened
so
quickly
one
after
the
other
that
they
are
still
confused
in
my
memory
at
the
time
i
knew
only
that
the
soldiers
were
following
and
surrounding
nell
and
me
that
my
heart
was
beating
fast
that
her
cheeks
were
scarlet
and
her
eyes
very
large
and
bright
either
with
fear
or
anger
or
both
that
i
felt
an
arm
go
round
my
waist
and
a
man
rather
beery
breath
close
to
my
ear
that
i
cried
oh
that
rude
girls
were
laughing
and
then
that
nell
was
boxing
a
man
ears
i
am
not
even
quite
sure
that
everything
was
in
this
exact
order
but
just
as
i
heard
that
sound
of
smack
smack
i
saw
sir
alexander
macnairne
not
far
off
and
without
stopping
to
remember
that
we
were
supposed
to
be
frisian
peasant
girls
i
called
to
him
i
think
i
said
oh
sir
alexander
macnairne
come
please
come
with
that
he
began
to
knock
people
about
and
break
a
path
through
to
get
to
us
and
some
of
them
laughed
and
some
were
angry
even
in
those
few
seconds
i
could
see
that
he
was
a
man
and
that
the
laughs
made
him
furious
he
said
things
in
english
with
just
the
faintest
scotch
burr
and
as
there
were
no
dutchmen
of
van
type
in
the
rude
crowd
the
scotsman
had
soon
tumbled
the
men
about
like
ninepins
all
except
the
soldiers
and
got
close
to
us
but
the
soldiers
were
not
to
be
thrown
off
so
easily
even
by
such
a
big
man
as
sir
alexander
macnairne
and
nell
and
i
would
have
been
in
all
the
horrors
of
a
fight
a
fight
on
our
account
too
if
jonkheer
brederode
had
not
appeared
in
the
midst
as
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
as
if
he
had
dropped
from
the
round
full
moon
he
must
have
come
from
behind
me
and
my
mouth
was
open
to
exclaim
how
thankful
i
was
to
see
him
when
he
hastily
whispered
just
loud
enough
for
nell
and
me
to
hear
do
seem
to
know
me
then
he
began
talking
authoritatively
in
dutch
to
the
young
soldiers
looking
so
stern
and
formidable
that
it
was
no
wonder
the
fun
died
out
of
their
faces
they
were
mere
boys
all
four
and
they
shrank
away
from
nell
and
me
as
if
we
had
been
hot
coals
which
had
burnt
them
when
they
touched
us
when
jonkheer
brederode
first
dashed
to
our
rescue
sir
alexander
macnairne
had
been
extremely
busy
with
two
of
the
little
soldiers
but
overawed
by
their
countryman
distinguished
manner
and
severe
words
they
lost
their
desire
to
fight
and
sheepishly
joined
their
companions
this
gave
sir
alexander
a
chance
to
see
to
whom
he
owed
the
diversion
and
to
my
surprise
he
exclaimed
rudolph
brederode
he
did
not
speak
the
name
as
if
he
were
pleased
but
uttered
it
quite
fiercely
his
face
grew
red
and
his
blue
eyes
sparkled
with
anger
i
astonished
for
neither
nell
nor
i
had
any
idea
that
they
knew
each
other
and
i
was
still
more
startled
and
horrified
as
well
to
see
sir
alexander
make
a
spring
toward
jonkheer
brederode
as
if
he
meant
to
strike
him
our
skipper
stood
perfectly
still
looking
at
him
though
sir
alexander
arm
was
raised
as
if
in
menace
but
at
that
instant
the
lifted
hand
was
seized
and
the
arm
was
moved
up
and
down
rapidly
as
if
it
were
a
stiff
that
needed
oiling
it
was
starr
who
had
seized
it
and
began
to
shake
it
so
furiously
before
the
tall
scotsman
had
time
to
understand
what
was
happening
starr
had
wheeled
him
round
so
that
his
back
was
turned
toward
us
and
i
heard
the
nice
american
voice
exclaiming
how
you
do
never
had
such
a
surprise
where
your
wife
where
my
wife
that
what
i
mean
to
ask
brede
sir
alexander
had
begun
struggling
to
get
his
hand
out
of
starr
cordial
clasp
but
before
i
could
hear
the
end
of
the
word
much
less
the
first
syllable
of
another
jonkheer
brederode
was
hustling
nell
and
me
out
of
sight
of
the
others
round
the
carousel
come
with
me
and
get
out
of
this
quickly
he
said
but
not
in
a
scolding
tone
such
as
i
had
dreaded
when
he
discovered
us
in
such
a
shocking
situation
brought
on
by
our
own
folly
i
was
dying
to
ask
questions
but
of
course
i
did
not
dare
and
though
i
was
afraid
at
first
that
nell
would
resist
she
was
as
meek
as
a
sugar
lamb
the
motive
seemed
very
mysterious
but
i
could
help
fancying
it
was
on
sir
alexander
macnairne
account
that
jonkheer
brederode
had
wished
us
not
to
recognize
him
still
i
could
not
think
why
when
we
had
talked
about
sir
alexander
macnairne
the
other
day
at
amsterdam
the
jonkheer
said
nothing
about
their
acquaintance
i
wondered
if
there
had
been
a
quarrel
and
if
so
what
it
could
have
been
about
though
it
was
certainly
no
affair
of
mine
still
it
is
hard
to
control
thoughts
and
i
wondered
more
and
more
as
jonkheer
brederode
hurried
nell
and
me
back
to
the
hotel
not
by
the
short
way
we
had
taken
before
but
dodging
about
through
a
dozen
intricate
streets
as
if
he
were
anxious
to
give
trouble
to
any
one
who
might
be
following
our
skipper
seemed
preoccupied
too
which
was
a
good
thing
for
us
as
it
took
his
mind
off
our
crimes
as
it
was
he
actually
made
no
allusion
to
our
strange
costume
our
escapade
or
even
the
hateful
adventure
from
which
he
had
rescued
us
for
that
he
rescued
us
there
was
no
question
sir
alexander
macnairne
with
his
quick
temper
and
his
ignorance
of
the
dutch
character
as
well
as
the
dutch
language
and
the
privileges
of
kermess
week
was
making
matters
worse
for
us
instead
of
better
when
jonkheer
brederode
dashed
in
and
saved
the
situation
what
would
have
happened
if
he
had
come
i
dared
not
think
for
there
would
certainly
have
been
a
fight
and
nell
and
i
might
presently
have
found
ourselves
with
sir
alexander
macnairne
in
the
hands
of
the
police
the
skipper
might
easily
have
enlarged
on
this
and
pointed
a
moral
lesson
but
not
a
word
did
he
say
about
anything
that
had
happened
maybe
this
humiliated
us
even
more
than
if
he
had
scolded
for
his
silence
was
very
marked
and
he
appeared
to
take
not
the
slightest
interest
in
either
of
us
except
to
get
us
indoors
where
we
could
do
no
further
mischief
his
manner
was
cold
and
whether
this
arose
from
his
strange
preoccupation
or
from
annoyance
with
us
i
could
decide
in
either
case
i
was
thankful
when
we
were
in
our
room
and
had
taken
off
our
shawls
and
the
beautiful
helmets
which
now
i
detested
but
we
had
not
had
time
to
undress
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
nell
opened
it
and
there
stood
lady
macnairne
in
a
with
a
veil
wrapped
over
her
head
perhaps
to
hide
i
thought
that
jonkheer
brederode
must
have
roused
her
up
to
report
our
crimes
and
sent
her
to
show
us
the
error
of
our
ways
though
to
do
such
a
thing
was
unlike
him
but
her
first
words
proved
that
i
had
misjudged
our
poor
skipper
girls
she
said
could
you
be
ready
to
leave
the
hotel
and
go
on
board
good
gracious
i
mean
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
almost
thought
she
must
be
talking
in
her
sleep
why
lady
macnairne
i
exclaimed
it
eleven
i
know
said
she
all
the
more
reason
for
haste
i
not
joking
there
a
reason
why
we
ought
to
be
off
at
once
of
course
is
your
boat
dear
nell
and
it
your
trip
but
you
and
phyllis
are
so
kind
to
me
always
that
i
sure
you
consent
without
asking
for
more
explanations
wo
you
when
i
say
that
it
for
sake
and
to
save
a
lot
of
bother
when
lady
macnairne
wants
anybody
to
do
anything
for
her
she
makes
herself
perfectly
irresistible
i
do
know
at
all
how
but
i
only
wish
i
had
the
art
of
doing
it
sometimes
she
is
domineering
if
it
a
man
to
be
managed
or
even
cross
sometimes
she
is
soft
as
a
dove
but
whichever
it
is
you
feel
as
if
streams
of
magnetic
fluid
poured
out
of
the
tips
of
her
fingers
all
over
you
and
your
one
anxiety
is
to
do
what
she
wants
you
to
do
as
quickly
as
possible
it
was
like
that
with
nell
and
me
now
we
said
both
together
that
we
would
be
ten
minutes
and
we
were
but
in
spite
of
the
wild
speed
with
which
we
flung
together
the
few
things
we
had
unpacked
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
were
dressed
except
for
our
hats
while
lady
macnairne
was
in
her
wrapper
she
was
ready
before
us
we
were
to
meet
in
her
room
and
just
as
we
arrived
in
hand
for
it
was
not
a
time
of
night
to
ring
for
porters
starr
appeared
round
a
turn
of
the
corridor
he
did
see
us
at
first
but
began
to
say
something
to
his
aunt
about
a
narrow
shave
when
he
caught
sight
of
nell
and
me
inside
the
open
door
i
was
on
the
point
of
asking
him
what
had
become
of
sir
alexander
macnairne
with
whom
we
had
left
him
violently
shaking
hands
when
i
remembered
that
lady
macnairne
had
said
he
was
a
relation
of
hers
by
marriage
so
i
thought
since
there
was
evidently
trouble
of
some
sort
between
him
and
jonkheer
brederode
i
had
better
not
bring
up
the
subject
in
her
presence
whatever
might
be
the
mysterious
reason
which
was
taking
us
away
like
thieves
in
the
night
starr
had
the
air
of
knowing
it
as
he
naturally
would
since
lady
macnairne
was
his
aunt
but
no
matter
which
of
the
other
two
men
was
to
blame
i
was
sure
was
innocent
he
was
as
nice
and
helpful
too
about
carrying
down
all
our
things
as
if
it
were
his
interest
instead
of
the
others
to
get
us
out
of
the
hotel
and
on
to
the
boat
although
he
is
such
a
lazy
erratic
young
man
that
he
must
have
been
quite
upset
by
the
surprise
and
confusion
jonkheer
brederode
had
been
paying
our
bills
and
settling
up
with
the
landlady
who
seemed
to
be
the
only
person
not
at
the
kermess
as
we
all
walked
toward
him
to
show
that
we
were
ready
to
start
i
caught
a
few
words
which
the
landlady
was
saying
i
am
not
yet
sure
of
getting
things
right
in
dutch
but
it
did
sound
as
if
she
said
in
reply
to
some
question
or
order
of
his
rely
on
me
no
such
impertinent
demand
shall
be
answered
a
stuffy
cab
which
might
have
been
fifty
years
old
had
it
seemed
been
called
by
starr
who
was
as
sympathetic
as
usual
in
the
dilemmas
of
others
we
squeezed
in
anyhow
except
jonkheer
brederode
who
sat
on
the
box
to
tell
the
driver
how
to
go
his
cap
pulled
over
his
eyes
as
if
it
were
pouring
with
rain
instead
of
being
the
most
brilliant
moonlight
night
and
tibe
sat
on
all
our
laps
at
once
hendrik
and
toon
sleep
on
mascotte
and
waterspin
and
they
were
on
board
true
to
duty
though
if
they
had
been
anything
but
dutchmen
they
would
probably
have
sneaked
slyly
off
to
the
kermess
they
are
not
the
sort
of
persons
who
show
surprise
at
anything
nell
says
that
if
the
motor
burst
under
hendrik
nose
he
would
simply
rub
it
with
a
piece
of
cotton
waste
his
nose
or
the
motor
it
would
not
much
matter
which
and
go
on
with
what
he
had
been
doing
before
so
no
time
was
lost
and
in
ten
minutes
we
were
off
finding
our
way
by
the
clear
moonlight
as
easily
as
if
it
had
been
day
we
had
not
gone
far
when
i
spied
another
larger
than
ours
but
not
so
smart
in
harbor
and
i
stared
with
all
my
eyes
trying
to
make
out
her
name
for
she
had
not
been
there
when
we
came
in
but
mascotte
flew
by
like
a
bird
much
faster
than
she
ever
goes
by
day
in
the
and
i
could
not
see
it
everything
was
much
too
exciting
for
us
to
wish
to
sleep
though
had
we
stopped
quietly
in
the
hotel
we
should
have
been
in
bed
before
this
jonkheer
brederode
advised
us
to
go
below
as
the
air
was
chilly
on
the
water
and
such
a
wind
had
come
up
that
it
blew
away
two
cushions
from
our
but
we
would
not
be
persuaded
out
of
the
narrow
canal
we
slid
into
a
wide
expanse
of
water
cold
as
liquid
steel
under
the
moon
and
tossed
into
little
waves
which
sent
mascotte
rolling
from
side
to
side
so
choppily
that
i
was
glad
to
get
into
the
next
canal
even
narrower
than
the
first
such
a
mere
slip
of
water
that
cows
on
shore
vague
shadowy
shapes
puffed
clouds
of
breath
in
our
faces
as
we
leaned
toward
them
from
the
deck
the
windows
of
little
thatched
cottages
seemed
to
look
straight
into
our
cabin
windows
like
curiously
glinting
wakeful
eyes
and
jonkheer
brederode
said
that
by
daylight
when
the
canal
was
crowded
with
barges
and
lighters
it
needed
almost
as
much
skill
and
patience
to
steer
through
it
as
to
guide
a
through
piccadilly
in
the
height
of
the
season
it
took
bribery
and
corruption
i
afraid
to
get
the
sluice
gates
opened
for
us
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
jonkheer
brederode
had
his
club
flag
flying
in
case
any
one
proved
obstinate
but
no
one
did
so
perhaps
as
people
are
supposed
to
be
quite
the
opposite
of
their
real
selves
in
disposition
if
waked
suddenly
frisians
are
weak
and
yielding
if
roused
in
the
night
it
was
wonderful
to
see
the
moonlight
fading
into
dawn
over
the
canal
and
the
gentle
indistinct
landscape
and
i
wished
that
van
buren
could
have
been
with
us
as
i
am
sure
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
which
would
have
appealed
to
his
heart
especially
if
freule
menela
were
not
with
him
to
hold
him
down
to
earth
morning
was
clear
in
the
sky
when
we
came
to
groningen
and
we
were
not
in
the
least
tired
though
we
had
not
even
tried
to
doze
at
a
nice
hotel
called
by
the
odd
name
of
the
seven
provinces
where
jonkheer
brederode
had
arranged
for
us
to
stop
a
night
if
our
plans
had
not
been
suddenly
changed
there
was
a
telegram
for
nell
it
was
from
van
buren
and
said
can
i
bring
fiancée
and
sisters
to
spend
a
day
with
you
at
utrecht
answer
robert
van
scheveningen
of
course
one
word
costs
less
than
two
and
is
therefore
wiser
to
use
in
a
telegram
besides
she
his
fiancée
but
it
looked
so
irrevocable
staring
up
from
the
paper
that
i
felt
more
sorry
for
him
than
ever
i
was
a
little
excited
too
as
nell
was
wiring
back
yes
delighted
and
adding
the
date
on
which
we
expected
to
arrive
at
utrecht
i
am
excited
still
as
i
write
this
for
i
have
the
idea
that
freule
menela
was
angry
with
van
buren
for
spending
so
much
time
with
us
and
that
she
wants
to
punish
him
or
somebody
else
ronald
lester
starr
point
of
view
xxvii
i
should
think
few
men
ever
loved
more
passionately
yet
picturesquely
than
i
loved
those
two
beautiful
stepsisters
when
for
their
sakes
i
started
out
upon
a
criminal
career
to
have
their
society
to
gaze
daily
upon
their
lovely
faces
to
hear
their
charming
voices
and
to
find
out
which
girl
i
really
loved
more
than
the
other
i
willingly
stole
an
aunt
and
then
lied
about
her
so
often
that
eventually
i
almost
began
to
believe
she
was
my
aunt
perhaps
i
said
to
myself
when
any
barking
dogs
escaped
from
the
kennel
of
my
conscience
to
be
soothed
perhaps
she
had
been
my
aunt
in
another
state
of
existence
but
then
i
would
have
said
anything
about
her
to
myself
or
others
by
way
of
furthering
the
cause
and
the
game
was
well
worth
the
candle
for
the
first
part
of
the
trip
alb
being
frankly
and
openly
a
worshiper
of
the
adorable
nell
van
buren
my
own
countrywoman
i
saw
that
out
of
all
the
girls
i
ever
loved
including
her
stepsister
she
was
the
only
one
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
live
without
that
state
of
mind
lasted
up
to
the
night
when
we
arrived
at
the
deadest
of
all
dead
cities
of
the
zuider
zee
enkhuisen
there
it
broke
upon
me
out
of
a
clear
sky
that
my
angel
phyllis
rivers
loved
and
was
loved
by
another
that
other
a
graven
image
of
a
viking
who
could
never
appreciate
her
as
she
deserved
until
the
blow
fell
i
had
always
half
unconsciously
felt
that
she
was
there
that
if
i
lost
the
incomparable
nell
the
exquisite
phyllis
was
on
the
spot
to
console
me
and
she
is
at
her
best
as
a
consoler
but
suddenly
at
a
moment
when
i
was
soaked
with
rain
snubbed
by
nell
as
well
as
foolishly
concerned
about
the
fate
of
that
white
man
burden
my
albatross
and
altogether
to
bear
further
misfortunes
i
learnt
that
phyllis
regarded
me
as
a
brother
i
hid
my
chagrin
in
sympathy
for
hers
but
phyllis
in
tears
proved
distracting
she
is
the
one
girl
i
have
ever
seen
who
can
cry
without
a
deplorable
redness
of
the
nose
tears
rolled
like
pearls
over
her
lower
lashes
which
are
almost
as
long
as
the
fringe
of
the
upper
lids
and
i
wondered
how
i
could
ever
have
thought
another
girl
more
desirable
too
late
for
my
comfort
did
she
assure
me
that
in
her
opinion
my
case
was
not
hopeless
with
her
stepsister
it
was
phyllis
not
nell
whom
i
now
wished
to
snatch
from
the
arms
of
a
hated
rival
not
that
she
was
in
them
yet
but
she
might
be
at
any
minute
unless
i
secured
her
and
it
was
painful
that
at
such
a
crisis
she
should
throw
her
once
unattainable
stepsister
at
my
head
next
day
to
be
sure
when
alb
brought
the
to
our
rescue
at
urk
the
way
nell
big
hazel
eyes
lit
up
at
sight
of
him
set
my
heart
vibrating
again
like
a
pendulum
and
i
found
myself
much
in
the
same
condition
i
had
been
in
at
first
unable
to
decide
which
after
all
was
the
more
indispensable
of
the
two
girls
but
this
return
to
chaos
did
not
make
for
peace
of
mind
because
though
i
could
not
bear
to
lose
either
i
should
be
lucky
if
i
contrived
to
keep
one
besides
there
was
the
worry
about
sir
alec
macnairne
and
the
danger
that
he
might
pounce
down
upon
us
to
destroy
the
fabric
i
had
so
carefully
woven
altogether
the
features
of
friesland
were
not
cut
with
the
same
upon
my
perception
that
other
parts
of
holland
had
taken
a
few
weeks
or
even
days
ago
when
i
was
young
and
happy
as
i
remarked
early
in
our
black
partnership
even
an
albatross
can
have
its
uses
perhaps
if
the
truth
were
known
the
ancient
mariner
occasionally
fell
down
and
would
have
broken
a
bone
if
the
albatross
tied
round
his
neck
had
not
acted
as
a
kind
of
cushion
for
his
protection
at
amsterdam
in
a
moment
of
peril
for
our
plot
alb
acted
somewhat
in
this
capacity
for
me
showing
himself
to
be
possessed
of
all
that
shrewd
adroitness
which
should
furnish
the
equipment
of
every
villain
at
leeuwarden
therefore
it
was
for
me
to
do
something
desperate
when
desperate
need
arose
i
shall
never
cease
to
applaud
my
own
presence
of
mind
in
the
matter
of
turning
the
enemy
flank
my
wrists
were
lame
for
days
after
that
famous
handshake
with
aunt
fay
husband
which
in
his
surprise
spun
the
big
fellow
round
like
a
teetotum
and
gave
alb
a
chance
to
vanish
with
the
girls
if
aunt
fay
had
indeed
been
on
board
lorelei
mascotte
if
the
late
had
been
brederode
boat
and
he
had
really
been
flirting
with
my
aunt
through
the
waterways
of
holland
according
to
sir
alec
wild
impression
i
could
have
been
more
anxious
to
save
her
from
his
jealous
wrath
by
giving
him
the
slip
alb
had
never
spoken
of
a
flirtation
and
though
at
the
time
it
was
first
sprung
upon
me
by
sir
alec
i
was
angry
with
the
albatross
for
his
my
inconvenient
sense
of
justice
forced
me
to
admit
afterwards
that
it
was
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
he
could
have
confided
to
me
of
all
others
when
that
peppery
scotsman
opened
his
heart
and
poured
forth
the
true
story
of
aunt
fay
mysterious
disappearance
from
the
scene
for
a
minute
or
two
any
feather
floating
in
my
direction
could
have
knocked
me
down
but
i
hung
on
to
my
captive
uncle
all
the
same
while
i
rearranged
my
ideas
of
the
universe
at
large
and
my
corner
of
it
in
particular
i
told
him
it
was
nonsense
to
be
jealous
of
aunt
fay
of
course
such
a
pretty
jolly
woman
as
she
full
of
life
and
fun
as
a
girl
was
bound
to
be
popular
with
men
and
to
flirt
with
them
a
little
there
was
nothing
in
that
to
make
a
fuss
about
said
i
as
for
brederode
whom
i
had
to
admit
knowing
since
we
must
have
been
seen
together
i
assured
sir
alec
that
if
he
could
hear
rudolph
talk
in
a
friendly
way
about
my
aunt
he
would
have
the
slightest
uneasiness
finally
i
made
the
fiery
fellow
confess
that
aunt
fay
last
little
flirtation
the
most
innocent
in
the
world
like
all
her
affairs
was
not
with
brederode
but
with
an
englishman
an
officer
in
some
crack
regiment
sir
alec
did
not
deny
that
he
had
scolded
his
wife
he
said
that
she
had
answered
him
back
that
there
had
been
words
on
both
sides
that
she
had
stamped
her
foot
and
thrown
a
bunch
of
roses
at
him
roses
snatched
from
a
vase
which
happened
to
be
handy
that
he
had
called
her
a
minx
that
she
had
retorted
with
beast
that
he
had
stalked
out
of
the
room
and
then
out
of
the
house
slamming
doors
as
hard
as
he
could
that
when
he
returned
not
exactly
to
apologize
but
to
make
up
at
any
price
it
was
to
find
her
gone
with
her
maid
and
several
boxes
leaving
no
address
that
he
had
tracked
her
to
london
and
eventually
as
he
believed
to
paris
that
while
there
he
had
seen
a
newspaper
paragraph
announcing
that
lady
macnairne
was
traveling
through
dutch
waterways
on
a
belonging
to
jonkheer
brederode
that
he
had
taken
train
for
amsterdam
where
he
had
presently
discovered
that
lorelei
had
been
that
he
had
visited
all
hotels
hoping
to
find
the
names
of
the
party
in
the
visitors
book
but
had
not
been
able
to
discover
them
luckily
we
had
put
our
names
down
and
on
leaving
alb
had
tactfully
hinted
to
the
manager
that
no
inquiries
concerning
us
were
to
be
answered
that
since
then
all
trace
of
lorelei
had
been
lost
i
replied
that
it
was
probably
a
mistake
made
by
some
journalist
and
that
lady
macnairne
had
never
been
on
board
brederode
boat
i
was
going
on
to
say
more
things
when
sir
alec
exclaimed
why
ought
to
know
where
the
boat
is
and
who
on
board
her
you
and
brederode
were
together
and
we
had
been
together
for
ten
minutes
i
vowed
and
kept
to
the
strict
letter
of
the
truth
for
i
had
been
smoking
alone
in
the
garden
when
brederode
came
back
and
proposed
that
after
all
we
should
have
a
stroll
round
the
fair
it
had
taken
us
ten
minutes
to
get
there
from
the
hotel
i
did
ask
brederode
any
questions
about
himself
after
meeting
him
i
went
on
and
that
also
was
strictly
true
but
i
hurriedly
added
seeing
a
loophole
of
escape
i
can
look
him
up
if
you
like
and
without
mentioning
your
name
find
out
whether
aunt
fay
is
or
ever
has
been
with
his
party
which
i
doubt
do
you
think
for
the
sake
of
her
name
and
yours
that
would
be
better
than
for
you
to
seek
him
out
and
make
a
row
before
you
sure
whether
there
anything
to
row
about
sir
alec
reflected
for
a
minute
which
was
evidently
an
effort
then
answered
that
perhaps
i
was
right
but
supposing
i
missed
brederode
whose
haste
to
slip
away
went
far
to
prove
his
guilt
i
would
not
miss
him
said
i
and
his
disappearance
proved
nothing
there
were
those
pretty
frisian
girls
that
he
sir
alec
had
been
protecting
when
rudolph
and
i
came
along
brederode
had
probably
escorted
them
home
not
seeing
any
reason
why
he
should
interrupt
our
conversation
my
innocent
surprise
on
hearing
that
despite
their
costumes
the
girls
were
not
frisian
girls
but
english
or
american
ladies
he
had
met
in
amsterdam
convinced
sir
alec
that
they
were
strangers
to
me
and
finally
the
scene
ended
by
my
promising
to
find
brederode
who
was
certainly
i
said
stopping
in
the
town
whether
or
no
he
had
brought
a
to
leeuwarden
i
was
to
question
brederode
in
a
diplomatic
manner
and
then
to
report
to
sir
alec
on
a
he
had
hired
in
amsterdam
as
the
best
means
of
tracking
down
the
craft
for
which
he
sought
this
boat
wilhelmina
was
now
in
the
canal
at
leeuwarden
but
for
reasons
intimately
concerning
that
canal
he
had
taken
a
room
for
the
night
at
a
hotel
recommended
by
his
chauffeur
fortunate
it
was
for
us
that
the
chauffeur
did
not
happen
to
prefer
our
hotel
and
almost
equally
fortunate
that
sir
alec
was
not
spending
much
time
on
board
his
hired
vessel
for
were
he
lurking
there
it
would
be
difficult
to
slip
past
without
being
followed
he
had
perhaps
seen
mascotte
on
entering
the
canal
as
it
appeared
that
he
had
come
in
only
toward
evening
but
he
had
not
suspected
the
little
creature
with
her
fat
chaperon
waterspin
of
having
an
alias
if
however
a
attempted
to
glide
past
his
in
the
night
he
would
give
chase
and
see
us
on
board
mascotte
for
this
reason
i
was
delighted
to
hear
that
he
was
at
a
hotel
for
the
night
and
i
advised
him
to
go
there
at
once
to
await
my
coming
how
long
shall
you
be
he
asked
impatiently
i
assured
him
that
all
i
had
to
do
might
keep
me
an
hour
but
i
saved
a
few
tattered
rags
of
conscience
by
evading
a
verbal
promise
to
call
on
him
at
the
end
of
that
hour
so
much
he
took
for
granted
and
as
the
things
i
had
to
do
were
to
get
the
whole
party
on
to
mascotte
and
out
of
the
capital
of
friesland
i
left
my
without
much
ceremony
nothing
could
have
been
neater
than
the
way
we
gave
him
the
slip
flying
by
his
deserted
without
a
qualm
and
i
hoped
beyond
his
reach
at
the
same
time
never
during
the
whole
course
of
the
trip
had
i
been
as
glad
to
arrive
at
a
place
as
i
was
to
arrive
at
groningen
we
ought
according
to
the
program
of
our
itinerary
mapped
out
by
alb
to
have
reached
the
big
town
in
the
afternoon
instead
of
morning
and
to
have
spent
the
time
till
evening
in
seeing
sights
but
all
was
changed
now
luckily
alb
who
is
an
uncomfortable
stickler
for
truth
at
all
costs
could
conscientiously
inform
the
girls
that
groningen
principal
attractions
might
be
seen
in
a
couple
of
hours
we
tore
round
the
place
in
the
fastest
cab
to
be
got
i
having
bribed
the
driver
not
to
spare
his
horse
yet
it
was
at
alb
the
girls
looked
reproachfully
when
they
were
allowed
but
three
minutes
in
the
largest
of
holland
five
for
martin
church
and
the
organ
praised
by
diplomatic
erasmus
two
to
search
vainly
for
glass
tiles
on
houses
which
amici
admired
forty
years
ago
and
another
grudging
two
for
a
gallop
through
the
noorden
plantation
of
which
the
rich
town
is
proud
there
must
be
something
about
my
appearance
which
convinces
people
that
whatever
evil
is
afoot
i
at
least
am
innocent
i
have
noticed
this
since
boyhood
the
phenomenon
being
most
conspicuous
when
i
was
least
deserving
whereas
with
alb
it
is
the
other
way
round
his
darkly
handsome
face
with
its
severely
features
his
black
hair
and
brows
his
somber
eyes
are
the
legitimate
qualifications
of
the
stage
villain
even
the
cigarette
is
seldom
lacking
therefore
if
i
wished
for
revenge
i
have
often
had
it
when
i
am
to
blame
for
anything
alb
is
sure
to
be
suspected
indeed
any
one
might
have
thought
from
the
impatient
fire
in
his
eyes
as
he
steered
lorelei
alias
mascotte
through
the
canal
after
leaving
groningen
that
his
was
the
secret
need
for
haste
his
the
guilty
desire
to
escape
as
for
me
i
hid
my
rage
at
the
legal
mandate
which
here
compelled
us
to
go
no
faster
than
a
man
can
walk
under
an
air
of
blithe
i
disguised
my
fears
never
starting
perceptibly
at
any
toot
behind
us
which
might
mean
sir
alec
on
our
track
and
appearing
to
enjoy
with
the
free
spirit
of
a
boy
the
one
great
amusement
of
the
day
this
consisted
in
surprising
and
making
happy
many
families
of
children
on
board
the
lighters
we
passed
by
bestowing
upon
them
toys
and
strange
sugary
cakes
bought
at
leeuwarden
kermess
not
all
the
lighters
had
children
but
those
that
had
owned
dozens
and
all
the
ugly
ones
had
if
i
had
been
given
my
way
only
the
pretty
children
and
those
who
did
not
whoop
should
have
got
presents
but
the
extraordinary
lady
who
plays
the
part
of
aunt
to
me
and
chaperon
to
the
angels
said
that
the
uglier
you
are
the
more
gifts
you
need
perhaps
it
is
on
this
principle
she
has
demanded
so
many
from
me
but
she
ugly
i
hardly
know
she
has
one
of
those
strange
little
faces
which
do
not
seem
to
express
the
soul
behind
them
a
face
whose
features
i
ca
see
when
i
shut
my
eyes
i
should
like
by
the
way
to
know
what
hers
are
like
behind
her
big
blue
spectacles
but
she
says
they
are
not
strong
so
possibly
the
blue
glass
is
a
merciful
dispensation
her
mildest
hints
as
well
as
her
commands
are
invariably
acted
upon
and
though
she
seldom
insists
she
magnetizes
accordingly
the
ugliest
children
got
the
best
things
but
as
there
were
more
pretty
than
ugly
ones
the
toys
lasted
all
the
way
along
the
somewhat
monotonous
canal
to
assen
a
little
town
half
lost
in
its
own
forests
it
took
us
till
evening
to
get
there
and
as
we
were
to
sleep
on
the
boats
rather
than
risk
the
hotel
i
proposed
to
alb
that
we
should
start
again
early
the
next
morning
before
the
ladies
waked
there
ca
be
much
to
see
at
assen
said
i
and
if
after
he
been
given
the
slip
my
peppery
scotch
uncle
tumbled
to
the
idea
of
and
being
one
that
would
be
reason
enough
for
stopping
at
assen
said
brederode
there
things
to
see
there
very
good
and
unique
things
but
ordinary
tourists
do
often
hear
about
them
and
if
sir
alec
macnairne
is
chasing
us
he
glide
by
assen
without
a
thought
this
put
a
different
face
on
the
matter
and
i
was
able
to
smile
calmly
when
alb
whetted
the
angels
appetite
by
describing
the
treasures
concealed
among
the
groves
surrounding
assen
they
were
not
exactly
at
assen
it
seemed
but
assen
was
the
and
from
there
you
set
forth
in
carriages
to
rolde
for
the
purpose
of
gazing
upon
hunnebetten
what
these
might
be
when
you
found
them
i
had
not
an
idea
though
pride
forbade
me
to
inquire
of
alb
especially
before
the
girls
but
pride
never
forbids
aunt
fay
little
counterfeit
presentment
perhaps
it
will
save
time
if
in
the
future
i
allude
to
her
as
the
to
ask
any
question
she
is
never
satisfied
with
but
demands
and
absorbs
information
about
every
place
we
visit
scribbling
down
notes
in
the
book
she
wears
on
her
chatelaine
there
must
have
been
dozens
of
refills
fitted
in
between
the
silver
covers
since
we
started
though
what
she
wants
of
the
stuff
she
collects
i
ca
imagine
she
did
not
hesitate
to
exclaim
what
on
earth
are
hunnebetten
and
there
was
no
ignominy
in
listening
with
a
bored
air
of
having
been
born
knowing
these
things
while
alb
described
the
objects
as
supposed
graves
of
huns
built
of
stones
next
morning
we
drove
out
to
worship
at
these
ancient
shrines
winding
along
a
charming
wooded
road
through
avenues
of
young
oaks
balsamic
pine
forests
and
acres
of
purple
heather
to
say
nothing
of
a
certain
pink
flower
which
must
be
heather
dutch
cousin
some
of
the
hunnebetten
were
hidden
in
the
woods
others
rose
gloomily
out
of
the
sweet
simplicity
of
a
hayfield
but
each
contrived
to
give
the
effect
of
a
miniature
stonehenge
and
had
there
been
only
one
monument
instead
of
three
it
would
have
been
worth
the
trouble
we
took
to
see
it
besides
our
expedition
was
rewarded
in
another
way
when
we
returned
to
the
boats
after
breakfasting
at
a
in
the
woods
it
was
to
hear
that
a
patriotically
bearing
the
name
of
wilhelmina
had
gone
by
faster
than
the
legal
limit
as
if
in
haste
to
reach
meppel
according
to
hendrik
and
toon
a
tall
gentleman
had
sprung
up
from
the
rushed
to
the
rail
and
stared
hard
at
mascotte
but
wilhelmina
had
not
slowed
down
on
hearing
this
news
i
was
inclined
to
make
an
excuse
for
lingering
at
assen
but
alb
was
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
as
safe
and
far
less
dull
to
go
on
wilhelmina
was
well
ahead
and
in
any
case
we
did
not
mean
to
stop
the
night
at
meppel
if
we
saw
sir
alec
launch
there
we
could
easily
slip
past
all
passengers
in
the
cabin
and
hendrik
at
the
helm
whereas
if
we
did
not
see
her
she
would
not
be
able
to
see
us
we
were
in
the
province
of
drenthe
now
and
it
looked
as
little
dutch
as
might
be
even
the
canal
had
the
air
of
disguising
itself
as
the
long
water
at
hampton
court
instead
of
being
content
to
seem
what
it
was
and
after
we
had
passed
a
few
dignified
mansions
and
farmhouses
we
came
to
a
region
of
squalid
cottages
with
women
and
children
shy
as
wild
creatures
of
the
wood
staring
at
us
from
doorways
it
was
not
until
we
were
far
on
our
eight
journey
to
meppel
that
we
slipped
once
more
into
a
characteristic
region
of
peace
and
plenty
marching
lines
of
dark
trees
with
foregrounds
of
pink
and
azure
flowers
or
golden
grain
mossy
thatched
roofs
and
red
tiles
crusted
with
golden
lichen
but
fortunately
for
the
disposal
of
our
toy
supply
renewed
at
assen
the
watery
way
was
starred
with
red
green
and
blue
barges
inhabited
by
large
families
of
infants
if
by
chance
we
encountered
a
childless
barge
we
glared
resentment
at
the
what
were
they
thinking
of
not
to
have
babies
these
people
the
world
of
water
and
sky
was
all
charm
and
grace
and
quaintness
again
at
meppel
and
beyond
and
i
was
in
a
mood
to
appreciate
its
beauty
there
for
we
had
a
glimpse
of
wilhelmina
in
harbor
and
apparently
deserted
passing
within
distant
sight
of
her
as
she
lay
in
harbor
brederode
gaily
put
on
speed
for
we
had
got
beyond
the
legal
limit
obstructions
of
the
drenthe
canal
into
the
freedom
of
the
ober
issel
a
wide
glitter
of
water
noble
as
the
frisian
meers
we
had
left
never
was
there
an
evening
more
exquisite
than
this
as
we
floated
on
through
the
sunset
with
the
old
town
of
zwolle
for
our
night
goal
we
were
in
the
swarzermeer
said
brederode
but
there
was
nothing
black
about
it
except
the
name
sky
and
water
had
all
the
rich
colors
of
an
opal
and
so
clear
were
they
so
alike
in
tints
and
brightness
that
we
seemed
to
hang
in
the
midst
of
a
rainbow
bubble
yellow
lay
on
a
surface
of
glass
like
scattered
gold
and
the
tall
thin
grasses
were
wires
in
the
level
light
of
the
sun
each
village
we
passed
was
a
picture
far
beyond
my
art
to
paint
and
hayricks
under
their
thatches
or
piles
of
corn
stacked
in
rows
close
to
the
water
edge
shone
like
a
spray
of
fireworks
as
the
darkening
sky
above
slowly
turned
to
a
bank
of
hyacinths
passing
sails
were
gold
at
first
then
brown
then
piercing
the
water
with
their
sharp
and
deep
reflections
the
was
crowded
thick
with
pink
and
violet
as
if
said
nell
ranks
of
fairy
soldiers
had
turned
out
in
our
honor
for
a
review
she
and
phyllis
stood
near
me
drinking
in
the
delicious
that
mingled
with
the
faint
fragrance
of
closing
lilies
and
watching
the
sun
as
beaten
into
copper
it
sent
a
sudden
stream
of
flame
across
the
glittering
crystal
i
tried
to
feel
alone
with
them
in
a
wonderful
world
which
was
for
us
three
and
nobody
else
except
a
few
swans
and
tiny
rustling
among
the
reeds
but
there
was
alb
at
the
wheel
looking
handsomer
and
more
inscrutable
than
i
could
ever
look
if
i
practised
for
hours
on
end
before
a
flattering
mirror
how
could
i
help
spoiling
everything
by
wondering
if
nell
van
buren
were
thinking
about
him
while
she
talked
with
me
fitfully
dreamily
and
how
could
i
help
asking
myself
whether
the
image
of
the
viking
did
not
come
blundering
between
phyllis
violet
eyes
and
mine
when
she
seemed
to
look
sweetly
at
me
but
it
was
the
sort
of
evening
when
one
thoroughly
enjoys
being
restless
and
unhappy
and
i
reveled
in
my
pain
little
yellow
birds
yellow
as
the
lilies
which
made
a
blazing
line
of
gold
between
green
reeds
and
amethyst
water
flitted
fearlessly
about
the
boat
until
at
last
the
sun
went
down
like
a
ruby
necklace
falling
into
a
crystal
box
then
we
moved
through
mysterious
masses
of
purple
shadow
with
here
and
there
a
or
the
wing
of
a
swan
like
the
moon
rising
and
then
our
own
little
lights
dipped
trailing
golden
tassels
under
the
surface
of
the
water
let
us
anchor
said
nell
at
last
and
put
out
our
lights
again
and
watch
the
moon
rise
oh
let
us
stay
here
all
night
and
wake
early
early
to
see
the
dawn
come
i
loved
her
for
thinking
of
it
and
so
i
fear
did
alb
we
dined
on
such
picnic
things
as
we
happened
to
have
on
board
and
when
a
pale
light
like
the
reflection
of
pearls
in
a
mirror
began
to
tremble
in
the
east
out
went
the
lights
the
moon
rose
and
phyllis
let
me
hold
her
hand
which
would
have
made
me
happy
if
i
had
been
almost
sure
she
was
feeling
sisterly
and
afterwards
i
dreamed
about
both
girls
they
were
both
in
love
with
me
and
after
all
i
was
in
love
with
some
one
else
whose
name
i
did
not
seem
to
know
of
whose
face
i
could
call
up
no
memory
it
was
alb
who
waked
me
by
pounding
on
the
door
of
my
cabin
on
waterspin
and
shouting
get
up
if
you
want
to
see
the
sunrise
so
i
bounded
out
of
bed
wishing
i
could
recall
that
just
to
make
sure
whether
or
no
it
was
more
beautiful
than
either
of
the
girls
and
by
the
time
i
had
dressed
and
gone
across
to
mascotte
deck
the
two
i
loved
were
on
deck
also
with
the
first
light
of
dawn
shining
in
their
eyes
what
did
it
matter
that
we
had
engaged
rooms
at
zwolle
which
we
had
not
occupied
we
breakfasted
there
instead
and
saw
a
beautiful
together
with
a
few
other
good
and
very
ancient
things
about
which
alb
seemed
to
know
a
great
deal
there
were
no
signs
of
wilhelmina
and
my
heart
felt
light
as
we
went
through
a
great
lock
into
the
geldern
yssel
which
would
bear
us
to
holland
most
beautiful
province
gelderland
xxviii
my
luck
was
out
in
gelderland
we
had
a
good
day
to
pretty
little
dieren
big
white
clouds
swimming
with
us
in
sky
and
under
water
where
they
moved
like
shining
fish
down
in
the
blue
depths
butterflies
chased
us
white
scarlet
and
gold
whirling
through
the
air
as
blow
in
a
high
wind
and
my
thoughts
flitted
as
they
flitted
for
i
was
too
drunk
with
that
elixir
joy
of
life
to
care
as
the
others
seemed
to
care
that
sir
philip
sidney
died
at
the
battle
of
zutphen
that
the
river
geldern
yssel
was
cut
thirteen
years
to
connect
the
rhine
with
something
else
that
we
were
going
to
see
het
loo
the
favorite
place
or
indeed
anything
else
that
could
possibly
be
improving
to
the
mind
i
cared
only
that
nell
and
phyllis
were
more
beautiful
than
ever
and
that
i
still
might
have
a
chance
with
one
of
them
let
alb
score
a
little
i
thought
by
his
knowledge
of
history
and
royalties
past
and
present
paint
each
of
the
girls
a
picture
and
they
forget
that
he
exists
but
i
did
not
yet
know
my
alb
and
his
resources
i
had
forgotten
that
gelderland
is
his
special
pitch
the
province
he
annexed
at
birth
fate
however
did
not
forget
we
got
to
appeldoorn
that
first
night
and
the
palace
of
het
loo
is
close
to
appeldoorn
so
we
drove
out
and
slept
at
a
hotel
near
the
palace
gates
here
it
was
that
the
worm
turned
in
other
words
alb
became
a
while
i
remained
an
ordinary
tourist
alb
had
influence
in
high
quarters
he
got
up
early
and
went
off
mysteriously
to
exert
it
returning
in
triumph
as
the
rest
of
us
including
tibe
were
breakfasting
on
the
broad
veranda
of
the
hotel
in
the
woods
anybody
could
go
into
the
but
he
had
got
permission
to
take
his
friends
into
the
palace
itself
the
girls
were
delighted
at
this
and
so
was
the
who
flew
off
so
quickly
to
get
a
refill
for
her
that
tibe
nearly
upset
an
old
peasant
with
a
broad
hat
and
silver
who
was
eating
and
drinking
of
the
best
at
a
table
near
ours
all
this
feminine
enthusiasm
over
alb
idea
piqued
me
just
enough
to
keep
me
from
joining
the
party
i
volunteered
for
dog
duty
while
the
others
saw
the
palace
and
by
special
favor
tibe
in
leash
wandered
reluctantly
with
me
through
the
fragrant
green
alleys
of
het
loo
with
me
he
saw
shining
lakes
and
crossed
miniature
bridges
guarded
by
mild
stone
lions
at
which
he
smelled
curiously
with
me
he
sadly
visited
the
queen
and
the
pretty
little
dairy
and
farm
reminiscent
of
poor
marie
antoinette
beloved
trianon
and
when
we
were
joined
by
his
mistress
and
the
others
he
was
ungrateful
enough
to
pretend
that
i
had
not
amused
him
alb
was
in
the
ascendant
and
the
gilt
had
not
had
time
to
wear
off
the
gingerbread
before
we
arrived
at
arnhem
we
got
there
in
a
day
from
appeldoorn
by
going
back
over
our
own
tracks
as
far
as
dieren
where
the
beautiful
little
canal
seemed
to
welcome
us
again
as
if
we
were
old
friends
through
the
thick
reeds
on
either
side
we
made
a
royal
progress
a
wave
of
water
swiftly
marching
ahead
to
give
them
news
of
our
approach
so
that
as
we
came
toward
them
the
nearest
might
bow
before
us
bending
their
graceful
green
heads
down
down
under
the
water
and
staying
there
until
we
had
passed
on
it
was
like
a
journey
through
a
long
exquisitely
designed
in
some
nobleman
park
until
a
rolled
up
to
darken
the
landscape
and
send
phyllis
for
protection
to
her
brother
side
i
should
certainly
have
asked
her
there
and
then
to
forget
the
viking
if
a
tree
near
by
had
not
been
struck
by
lightning
at
that
instant
and
nell
in
her
sudden
pallor
and
stricken
silence
had
not
been
more
beautiful
than
i
had
seen
her
yet
i
did
not
remember
until
we
had
been
settled
for
a
night
and
part
of
a
day
at
a
hotel
with
a
view
and
a
garden
that
alb
was
more
at
home
in
gelderland
than
elsewhere
in
holland
but
he
was
treated
with
marked
respect
at
the
bellevue
and
people
took
off
their
hats
to
him
in
the
street
with
irritating
deference
we
went
about
a
good
deal
in
the
town
seeing
historic
inns
and
other
show
things
the
best
of
which
was
a
room
once
occupied
by
philip
the
second
duke
of
alva
therefore
i
had
many
opportunities
of
increasing
my
respect
for
alb
as
a
personage
of
importance
if
i
had
been
inclined
to
profit
by
them
and
on
top
of
this
arrived
his
automobile
from
some
unknown
lair
there
were
some
famous
drives
to
be
taken
in
the
neighborhood
of
arnhem
he
explained
in
that
quiet
way
of
his
and
he
had
thought
it
would
be
pleasant
to
take
them
in
his
car
we
started
out
in
it
on
the
second
morning
and
hardly
had
we
left
the
big
with
its
parks
and
villas
when
we
plunged
into
forests
as
deep
as
majestic
as
those
round
haarlem
and
the
hague
forests
tunneled
with
long
green
avenues
of
beeches
where
the
light
was
the
green
light
which
mermaids
know
here
and
there
rose
the
fine
gateways
and
distant
towers
of
some
great
estate
and
brederode
told
us
that
gelderland
was
famous
for
its
old
families
and
houses
as
well
as
for
the
only
hills
in
holland
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
said
he
the
nobility
of
gelderland
was
so
proud
that
no
one
who
was
noble
was
allowed
to
buy
an
estate
and
settle
here
allowed
exclaimed
nell
how
could
they
be
prevented
if
they
had
money
and
an
estate
was
for
sale
brederode
smiled
there
were
ways
he
answered
once
a
rich
banker
of
amsterdam
thought
he
would
like
to
retire
and
have
a
fine
house
in
aristocratic
gelderland
he
bought
a
place
and
wished
to
build
a
house
to
please
his
fancy
but
no
architect
would
make
his
plans
nobody
would
sell
him
bricks
or
building
material
of
any
kind
and
he
could
get
no
workmen
every
one
stood
in
too
great
awe
of
the
powerful
nobles
so
you
see
boycotting
is
confined
to
ireland
or
america
what
happened
in
the
end
asked
nell
i
do
hope
the
man
did
give
in
dutchmen
do
even
to
each
other
said
alb
the
banker
was
as
obstinate
as
his
enemies
he
went
to
enormous
expense
got
everything
outside
boycot
limits
put
up
temporary
buildings
on
his
place
for
workmen
from
rotterdam
fed
them
and
himself
from
rotterdam
and
so
in
the
end
his
house
was
built
but
things
are
different
in
gelderland
now
people
who
were
rich
then
are
poor
and
glad
of
any
one
money
arnhem
is
as
cosmopolitan
as
the
hague
though
it
has
the
same
curious
set
you
find
there
keeping
quite
to
itself
a
good
many
of
the
famous
old
places
have
been
sold
in
these
days
to
the
but
some
are
left
unspoiled
and
i
going
to
show
you
one
of
them
with
that
he
drove
his
car
through
a
wide
open
gateway
a
saluting
as
we
went
by
oh
but
how
do
you
know
we
may
go
in
asked
phyllis
i
sure
we
may
said
brederode
are
strangers
allowed
the
questioned
him
harmless
ones
like
us
far
away
a
house
was
in
sight
a
beautiful
old
house
built
of
mellowed
red
brick
its
great
tower
and
several
minor
turrets
mirrored
in
a
lake
which
surrounded
it
on
two
sides
like
an
exaggerated
moat
fifteenth
century
said
brederode
but
the
big
tower
dates
from
twelve
hundred
and
fifty
we
all
stared
in
respectful
awe
of
age
and
majesty
as
alb
stopped
the
car
at
a
small
iron
gate
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
house
the
gate
guarded
by
giant
oaks
led
through
a
strip
of
shadowy
park
to
a
glorious
labyrinth
of
and
gardens
entirely
given
up
to
lilies
of
every
imaginable
variety
while
beyond
these
was
a
copied
from
that
of
the
generalife
which
i
saw
last
year
at
granada
nor
was
this
all
of
spanish
fashion
which
had
been
imitated
pedro
the
cruel
walks
in
the
alcazaar
of
seville
had
been
copied
too
and
were
put
in
operation
for
our
amusement
by
a
gardener
with
whom
brederode
had
a
short
confab
when
we
passed
again
through
the
rose
and
lily
gardens
which
were
in
a
valley
or
dimple
between
two
gentle
hills
all
three
of
the
ladies
were
presented
with
as
many
flowers
as
they
could
carry
and
alb
informed
them
that
they
would
find
more
of
other
varieties
waiting
for
them
in
the
car
what
a
divine
place
exclaimed
nell
as
we
came
once
more
to
the
little
gate
whence
we
had
the
double
picture
of
the
house
and
its
reflection
in
the
lake
i
do
see
how
there
could
be
any
lovelier
one
even
in
england
how
i
should
like
to
live
in
that
wonderful
old
house
i
have
my
own
room
and
a
boudoir
in
the
tower
would
you
care
to
go
in
alb
asked
looking
more
at
phyllis
than
at
nell
nell
flushed
and
left
phyllis
to
answer
it
would
be
quite
like
a
fairy
tale
but
of
course
we
ca
as
the
people
of
the
house
are
evidently
occupying
it
all
the
better
said
brederode
the
lady
of
the
house
will
receive
us
and
give
us
tea
no
no
cried
nell
it
would
be
horried
to
intrude
upon
her
you
find
she
wo
consider
it
an
intrusion
alb
insisted
in
fact
i
called
yesterday
and
said
i
was
bringing
you
out
so
it
is
an
invitation
the
hall
was
stone
paved
with
glorious
oak
walls
and
a
wonderful
ceiling
there
were
a
few
persian
rugs
which
must
have
been
almost
priceless
a
quantity
of
fine
old
portraits
and
two
or
three
curious
suits
of
armor
beyond
was
a
chinese
room
done
in
the
perfect
taste
of
a
nation
which
loves
and
understands
oriental
treasures
and
then
we
came
into
a
paneled
boudoir
sparsely
but
exquisitely
furnished
with
inlaid
satinwood
which
i
would
wager
to
be
genuine
sheraton
in
this
room
sat
a
woman
who
rose
to
welcome
us
a
woman
worthy
of
her
surroundings
her
dress
was
nothing
more
elaborate
than
muslin
but
with
the
piled
silver
of
her
hair
her
arched
dark
brows
and
cameo
features
her
great
eyes
and
her
noble
figure
she
looked
a
princess
ah
rudolph
she
exclaimed
in
the
english
of
an
englishwoman
born
and
bred
how
glad
i
am
that
you
could
come
and
bring
the
friends
of
whom
you
have
written
me
so
often
my
mother
brederode
said
and
introduced
us
i
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
that
i
was
had
he
written
how
much
had
he
told
in
what
way
had
he
described
some
of
us
nell
who
usually
has
some
original
little
thought
to
put
into
words
apparently
had
no
thoughts
at
all
or
they
lay
too
deep
for
utterance
the
was
taciturn
too
which
was
prudent
on
her
part
as
this
exquisite
lady
had
probably
heard
her
son
speak
of
his
scotch
friend
lady
macnairne
had
she
ever
met
aunt
fay
i
knew
that
alb
was
too
wise
if
not
too
loyal
to
have
brought
us
into
her
power
still
i
did
not
feel
safe
enough
to
be
comfortable
and
even
if
i
had
been
personally
at
ease
i
should
have
been
too
busy
with
my
own
thoughts
to
do
credit
to
myself
or
country
in
conversation
as
i
sipped
caravan
tea
from
a
cup
of
old
dresden
i
wondered
what
were
nell
sensations
on
beholding
the
home
and
mother
of
the
despised
skipper
whom
it
had
been
her
delight
to
snub
and
tease
evidently
he
is
adored
and
looked
up
to
as
the
one
perfect
being
by
his
mother
who
would
hardly
have
smiled
as
graciously
on
the
beautiful
miss
van
buren
could
some
imp
have
whispered
in
her
ear
how
that
young
lady
treated
her
host
when
he
was
nobody
but
a
poor
skipper
on
board
a
through
some
careless
word
which
gave
a
turn
to
the
conversation
i
discovered
that
liliendaal
is
not
the
only
house
reigned
over
by
jonkheer
brederode
alias
alb
there
one
at
the
hague
but
they
find
liliendaal
pleasant
in
summer
indeed
it
appears
to
me
that
pleasant
is
only
a
mild
and
modest
word
for
the
place
yet
its
owner
can
cheerfully
desert
it
week
after
week
to
rub
along
as
a
mere
despised
albatross
on
board
a
tuppenny
running
about
the
canals
of
holland
of
course
he
is
in
love
which
covers
a
multitude
of
hardships
but
it
is
as
clear
as
it
used
to
be
which
angel
he
is
in
love
with
perhaps
the
latest
snubbing
was
the
last
drop
in
his
cup
which
caused
the
whole
to
overflow
and
he
had
to
fill
it
up
again
for
another
he
poured
scorn
upon
me
in
our
first
passage
of
arms
for
being
in
love
with
two
girls
at
once
but
how
much
more
poetical
and
at
the
same
time
more
generous
to
love
two
at
a
time
than
not
to
love
one
well
enough
to
know
your
own
mind
in
any
case
it
was
phyllis
who
shone
on
the
occasion
of
our
call
at
liliendaal
and
it
was
she
who
seemed
to
make
the
impression
upon
the
gracious
mother
whether
it
was
the
fact
that
she
is
english
or
whether
it
was
because
she
could
talk
to
her
hostess
as
if
she
knew
them
about
various
distinguished
titled
beings
whom
the
lady
of
liliendaal
had
not
seen
for
a
long
time
or
whether
it
was
because
phyllis
once
had
a
cousin
who
wrote
a
book
about
the
earls
of
helvelyn
the
lady
father
was
an
earl
of
helvelyn
at
all
events
the
honors
were
for
phyllis
and
if
alb
really
had
changed
his
mind
about
the
two
girls
as
the
is
continually
saying
he
ought
to
have
been
pleased
illustration
was
phyllis
who
shone
at
phyllis
and
my
alleged
aunt
were
both
particularly
gracious
to
him
on
the
way
back
to
arnhem
as
if
he
had
risen
in
their
esteem
now
that
they
realized
what
an
important
man
he
is
but
afterwards
when
i
accused
the
of
this
piece
of
snobbishness
she
vowed
that
it
was
only
because
they
both
realized
how
much
he
was
giving
up
for
the
sake
of
somebody
just
because
i
could
not
be
sure
which
one
the
somebody
was
and
whether
he
were
more
likely
to
prevail
after
this
i
was
uneasy
in
my
mind
with
the
new
knowledge
of
alb
greatness
what
are
my
dollars
to
his
beautiful
old
houses
and
a
mother
who
is
the
daughter
of
an
english
earl
i
suppose
these
things
count
with
girls
even
such
adorable
girls
as
nell
van
buren
and
phyllis
rivers
a
thing
that
happened
the
same
evening
has
not
relieved
my
anxiety
at
the
hotel
bellevue
each
room
on
the
floor
where
we
live
has
its
own
slip
of
balcony
separated
from
the
next
by
a
partition
i
was
sitting
on
mine
after
we
had
all
said
to
each
other
smoking
a
cigarette
and
waiting
for
the
moon
to
rise
an
act
which
she
selfishly
postpones
at
this
time
of
the
month
so
as
to
give
her
admirers
as
much
trouble
and
as
little
sleep
as
possible
suddenly
i
heard
phyllis
voice
on
the
other
side
of
the
balcony
partition
dearest
she
was
saying
dreamily
is
it
strange
how
on
a
night
like
this
you
seem
to
see
things
clearly
which
have
been
dark
before
it
is
so
very
strange
nell
answered
practically
the
coming
up
and
that
a
sign
we
ought
to
be
going
to
bed
i
did
mean
that
said
phyllis
i
mean
there
a
kind
of
on
such
a
beautiful
night
which
makes
you
see
into
your
own
heart
what
do
you
see
asked
nell
i
wanted
to
know
what
as
much
as
nell
did
and
a
great
deal
more
judging
from
her
tone
but
unfortunately
i
had
no
right
to
try
and
find
out
so
i
got
up
and
scraped
my
chair
and
prepared
to
go
indoors
but
i
had
forgotten
to
shut
my
when
i
lighted
a
cigarette
a
few
minutes
before
and
now
i
knocked
it
off
the
table
where
it
had
been
lying
scattering
over
the
floor
every
match
i
had
left
in
the
world
if
they
intended
to
say
anything
really
private
i
had
made
noise
enough
to
prevent
them
from
doing
it
so
i
thought
i
might
conscientiously
remain
and
pick
up
some
of
the
matches
the
of
the
hotel
had
gone
to
its
beds
therefore
if
i
wanted
to
smoke
later
it
must
be
these
matches
or
none
after
all
i
not
quite
sure
what
i
see
when
i
come
to
ask
myself
like
that
in
so
many
words
said
phyllis
i
do
wish
advise
me
will
you
dear
of
course
if
i
can
came
the
answer
a
little
shortly
well
supposing
cared
more
than
you
thought
you
ought
for
a
man
it
could
be
right
to
care
for
at
all
because
he
belonged
to
some
one
else
what
would
you
do
try
to
stop
caring
for
him
said
nell
that
what
i
think
too
only
it
might
be
hard
might
it
do
you
suppose
it
would
be
easier
if
a
girl
did
her
best
to
learn
to
love
another
man
who
was
free
to
care
for
her
and
did
seem
to
care
for
her
so
as
to
take
her
mind
off
the
the
man
no
answer
i
realized
that
they
could
not
have
heard
the
falling
and
i
was
at
my
now
going
in
but
the
door
is
a
dutch
door
which
means
that
it
is
cleaned
and
varnished
every
day
and
the
varnish
stuck
you
might
tell
me
what
you
think
nell
you
have
had
so
much
experience
in
serials
oh
exclaimed
nell
i
i
you
phil
their
door
evidently
did
not
stick
for
suddenly
it
slammed
and
i
guessed
that
nell
had
rushed
in
and
banged
it
shut
behind
her
now
it
is
the
next
day
but
one
after
this
episode
and
we
are
at
utrecht
after
having
visited
an
old
kastel
or
two
more
in
the
neighborhood
of
arnhem
and
then
following
the
rhine
where
it
winds
among
fields
like
a
wide
twisted
ribbon
of
silver
worked
into
a
fabric
of
green
brocade
its
high
waves
roughened
by
huge
steamers
spilt
us
into
the
lek
and
so
past
queer
little
ferries
and
a
great
crowded
lock
or
two
where
alb
used
his
club
flag
we
came
straight
to
the
fine
old
city
of
which
one
hears
and
knows
more
somehow
than
of
any
other
in
holland
i
planned
to
do
a
little
painting
here
but
after
all
i
do
seem
to
take
as
much
interest
in
composing
pictures
as
in
trying
to
puzzle
out
the
meanings
of
several
things
i
suppose
a
man
never
can
hope
to
understand
women
but
even
a
woman
sometimes
fails
to
understand
another
woman
for
instance
goaded
by
unsatisfied
curiosity
to
know
not
only
my
own
fate
but
everybody
else
fate
all
round
i
was
tempted
to
take
advantage
of
nephewhood
and
put
the
case
as
i
saw
it
to
the
i
ventured
to
tell
her
what
i
overheard
between
the
girls
on
their
balcony
now
you
must
know
i
said
that
i
in
love
with
phyllis
i
thought
it
was
nell
said
she
so
did
i
for
a
while
but
i
discovered
that
it
phyllis
and
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
can
tell
me
something
in
fact
if
you
your
dear
nephew
ronny
will
present
his
aunt
with
a
diamond
ring
you
mean
if
i
tell
you
what
you
want
to
hear
no
it
must
be
what
you
honestly
think
i
do
want
a
diamond
ring
said
she
which
surprised
me
extremely
it
was
the
first
time
anything
worth
having
has
been
mentioned
which
she
did
not
want
and
usually
ask
for
a
pearl
one
then
i
suggested
in
my
astonishment
i
do
want
a
pearl
one
or
any
other
one
so
you
can
save
yourself
the
trouble
of
working
through
a
long
list
replied
the
lady
who
is
engaged
to
be
my
obliging
relative
but
go
on
and
ask
what
you
were
going
to
ask
anything
i
can
do
for
you
as
an
aunt
i
will
i
am
paid
for
it
this
grew
curioser
and
curioser
as
alice
had
occasion
to
remark
in
her
adventures
but
having
embarked
upon
my
narrative
i
went
on
whom
do
you
think
phyllis
meant
when
she
spoke
of
trying
to
learn
to
love
a
man
who
seemed
to
love
her
was
it
alb
or
robert
van
buren
perhaps
you
were
going
to
say
cut
in
the
no
i
do
mean
him
i
answered
hurriedly
modesty
forbids
me
to
mention
the
name
in
my
mind
but
it
was
given
to
you
by
your
sponsors
in
baptism
will
it
make
you
very
unhappy
if
i
say
i
do
think
that
the
name
in
her
mind
i
shall
have
to
bear
it
i
said
but
of
course
i
shall
be
unhappy
we
all
seem
to
be
unhappy
lately
remarked
the
except
you
yes
except
me
of
course
she
responded
why
should
i
be
unhappy
tibe
loves
me
you
do
deserve
it
but
so
do
we
all
said
i
she
brightened
you
are
harmful
but
necessary
i
went
on
we
are
used
to
you
we
have
even
acquired
a
taste
for
you
i
do
know
why
or
how
but
you
have
an
uncanny
unauntlike
fascination
of
your
own
which
we
all
feel
at
times
it
is
even
akin
to
pain
oh
well
the
pain
will
soon
be
over
said
she
we
at
utrecht
now
soon
we
be
going
to
zeeland
from
zeeland
back
to
rotterdam
and
that
the
end
of
the
trip
and
my
engagement
it
will
be
then
i
feel
now
as
if
it
would
be
to
everything
i
sighed
i
never
nursed
a
fond
gazelle
you
tried
to
nurse
two
said
she
you
like
the
dog
who
dropped
the
substance
for
the
shadow
which
is
which
please
though
to
specify
would
perhaps
be
ungallant
to
both
besides
i
have
dropped
either
of
them
if
phyllis
is
lost
to
me
i
may
still
be
able
to
fall
back
on
nell
whom
nobody
else
seems
to
claim
at
present
oh
do
they
murmured
the
do
they
she
may
have
left
dozens
of
adorers
at
home
to
pick
up
again
when
she
goes
back
she
a
beautiful
girl
said
her
chaperon
radiantly
so
and
i
used
to
think
also
possessed
of
a
beautiful
disposition
but
since
she
flew
out
at
poor
little
phyllis
who
was
asking
for
advice
and
comfort
and
cried
hate
you
phil
now
you
a
woman
what
had
phyllis
said
to
put
her
in
a
rage
the
laughed
enough
to
put
a
saint
in
a
rage
said
she
and
nell
is
a
saint
but
they
been
more
devoted
to
each
other
than
ever
since
so
she
must
have
repented
and
apologized
and
been
forgiven
before
the
moon
went
down
oh
you
poor
puzzled
creature
i
would
be
a
for
anything
and
that
was
all
the
satisfaction
i
could
get
from
her
i
remain
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
but
robert
van
buren
his
sisters
and
his
fiancée
are
arriving
immediately
and
perhaps
i
may
get
enlightenment
during
the
visit
i
ought
to
have
some
reward
since
it
is
through
me
that
the
viking
is
coming
with
the
females
of
his
kind
at
this
particular
time
in
a
moment
of
quixotic
generosity
at
enkhuisen
i
promised
phyllis
as
a
newly
adopted
if
reluctant
brother
that
i
would
make
everything
right
for
her
afterwards
i
was
inclined
to
repent
of
the
plan
which
had
sprung
and
helmeted
from
my
suffering
brain
but
it
was
too
late
then
i
had
to
keep
my
word
for
i
was
sure
that
deep
down
in
her
mind
phyllis
was
expecting
me
to
perform
some
miracle
rather
than
disappoint
her
and
lower
my
i
had
a
talk
with
robert
the
day
he
was
leaving
not
an
intimate
talk
for
we
are
on
those
terms
but
i
managed
to
get
out
of
him
that
he
was
parting
from
us
before
he
had
intended
because
of
a
letter
from
the
fiancée
young
ladies
are
a
little
exacting
when
they
are
engaged
i
suppose
said
the
poor
fellow
they
feel
they
have
more
right
than
others
to
a
man
society
then
it
was
that
i
asked
why
he
did
bring
freule
menela
chaperoned
by
the
twins
to
utrecht
instead
of
waiting
until
we
had
got
as
far
as
zeeland
which
the
fiancée
might
think
too
long
a
journey
with
such
an
object
in
view
he
said
that
he
would
ask
her
do
seem
too
anxious
said
i
airily
and
do
tell
her
you
want
her
to
be
better
acquainted
with
your
cousin
and
just
remark
that
it
will
be
a
jolly
excursion
eh
and
you
might
add
that
brederode
and
i
particularly
i
are
awfully
keen
on
seeing
her
very
well
i
will
give
that
message
said
he
and
i
think
he
probably
did
give
it
or
something
like
it
for
nell
had
a
telegram
from
him
while
we
were
still
doddering
about
in
friesland
asking
if
he
might
bring
the
ladies
on
a
visit
to
utrecht
now
it
is
up
to
me
to
carry
out
that
plan
made
on
the
impulse
of
an
unselfish
moment
moral
do
not
have
unselfish
moments
xxix
i
believe
that
in
the
dark
ages
i
was
rather
a
good
little
boy
i
used
often
to
tell
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
even
when
most
inconvenient
to
my
pastors
and
masters
i
gave
pennies
to
the
poor
unless
i
very
much
wanted
them
myself
i
said
now
i
lay
me
every
night
and
also
in
the
morning
till
advised
that
it
was
inappropriate
and
i
sang
in
a
boy
choir
so
beautifully
and
with
such
a
soulful
expression
in
my
eyes
that
people
used
to
pat
my
curls
and
fear
that
i
was
destined
to
die
young
in
those
days
or
even
until
a
few
weeks
ago
no
one
who
looked
at
me
would
have
believed
me
capable
of
plotting
against
young
and
innocent
girls
annexing
aunts
on
the
hire
system
or
deluding
with
misleading
statements
yet
these
things
i
have
done
and
worse
for
i
have
kept
my
word
to
phyllis
rivers
if
i
must
commit
a
crime
my
artistic
sense
bids
me
do
it
well
and
then
of
course
when
one
has
started
in
a
certain
direction
one
is
often
carried
along
a
little
farther
than
one
intended
to
go
at
first
that
was
what
happened
to
me
in
the
affair
of
robert
van
buren
and
his
fiancée
i
was
pledged
to
phyllis
and
myself
to
free
the
viking
somehow
anyhow
it
was
rash
of
me
to
give
this
pledge
also
it
was
quixotic
and
many
hours
did
not
pass
after
making
it
before
i
was
seized
with
regret
and
convictions
that
i
had
been
an
ass
exactly
how
i
was
going
to
do
the
deed
did
not
occur
to
me
at
the
time
but
i
had
an
idea
which
fitted
in
with
my
other
villainies
so
well
that
it
seemed
really
a
pity
not
to
add
it
to
the
richly
colored
pattern
it
was
for
this
reason
that
i
dreaded
returning
to
the
hotel
du
pays
bas
from
a
walk
about
utrecht
knowing
as
i
did
that
the
van
buren
party
would
have
arrived
i
stayed
out
sketching
as
long
as
there
was
any
light
and
got
a
few
good
bits
of
the
old
town
a
shadowed
glimpse
of
one
of
strange
canals
unique
in
holland
with
its
double
streets
one
above
the
other
an
impression
of
the
cathedral
spire
seen
beyond
a
series
of
arched
bridges
a
couple
of
fishermen
bringing
up
a
primitive
net
fastened
on
four
branches
and
sparkling
as
it
came
out
of
the
water
like
a
spun
of
crystal
i
was
careful
not
to
appear
till
but
one
is
obliged
in
to
dine
early
in
holland
because
what
seems
early
to
a
foreigner
seems
late
to
a
dutchman
at
seven
i
went
to
the
it
has
become
a
regular
thing
for
her
to
have
a
and
behold
they
were
all
assembled
nell
was
plainly
dressed
in
the
simplest
kind
of
a
white
frock
but
phyllis
had
made
quite
a
toilet
poor
child
i
could
guess
why
she
need
not
however
have
given
herself
the
pains
the
fiancée
compared
with
her
was
like
a
withered
lemon
beside
a
delicately
ripening
peach
the
van
buren
twins
are
delicious
creatures
but
they
did
not
count
in
the
little
drama
besides
they
are
in
any
case
too
young
for
drama
they
are
just
beginning
to
rehearse
for
the
first
act
of
life
and
i
think
for
them
it
will
be
a
pretty
pastoral
never
drama
or
tragedy
or
even
lively
comedy
i
knew
from
phyllis
description
what
sort
of
girl
the
fiancée
would
turn
out
to
be
except
that
i
did
expect
to
find
her
quite
so
smart
her
dress
and
the
hat
she
had
put
on
for
the
hotel
dinner
might
have
come
from
the
rue
de
la
paix
which
was
all
the
more
credit
to
her
as
i
have
heard
a
dozen
times
if
i
have
heard
it
once
that
she
is
very
poor
as
poor
as
she
is
proud
now
was
my
time
to
set
the
ball
rolling
and
valiantly
i
gave
it
the
first
kick
i
feigned
to
be
much
taken
at
first
sight
with
the
young
lady
from
the
hague
at
once
i
flung
myself
into
conversation
with
her
in
which
we
were
both
so
deeply
absorbed
that
when
the
suggested
going
down
to
dinner
nobody
can
have
been
surprised
when
i
said
please
all
whom
it
may
concern
i
want
to
sit
next
to
freule
menela
van
der
windt
at
the
dinner
table
indeed
most
of
the
party
have
long
passed
the
stage
of
being
surprised
at
anything
i
do
a
state
of
mind
to
which
i
have
carefully
trained
them
the
viking
however
has
not
often
seen
me
at
my
best
so
he
stared
at
this
audacity
but
on
second
thoughts
decided
not
to
be
displeased
neither
was
the
fiancée
displeased
i
did
not
attribute
her
pleasure
to
the
power
of
my
manly
charms
but
the
young
lady
is
the
sort
of
young
lady
to
be
complimented
by
almost
any
marked
attention
from
any
man
especially
when
other
girls
prettier
than
herself
are
present
i
continued
to
absorb
myself
in
freule
menela
she
has
i
soon
discovered
a
veneering
of
intelligence
and
a
smattering
of
information
on
a
number
of
subjects
useful
in
a
we
talked
about
dutch
art
and
french
art
and
so
many
facts
was
the
maiden
able
to
launch
at
my
head
that
the
lovely
twins
gazed
at
their
future
with
ingenuous
admiration
evidently
she
had
gleaned
from
robert
all
he
had
to
tell
about
me
as
well
as
about
the
other
members
of
the
party
for
she
is
not
the
sort
of
girl
to
lay
herself
out
for
strangers
unless
she
considers
them
worth
while
apparently
she
did
consider
me
worth
while
and
during
dinner
she
had
hardly
a
word
for
the
viking
who
sat
on
her
other
side
but
that
was
all
the
better
for
him
because
it
gave
him
a
chance
to
talk
across
the
table
to
phyllis
and
to
look
at
her
when
he
was
sitting
dumb
there
going
to
be
an
illumination
this
evening
said
brederode
you
know
the
parks
and
gardens
you
admired
so
much
last
night
as
we
came
through
the
canal
into
utrecht
well
there
will
be
colored
lights
there
and
a
walk
along
the
would
be
rather
nice
if
any
one
feels
inclined
for
it
oh
do
let
go
exclaimed
phyllis
and
the
twins
echoed
her
enthusiastically
that
was
enough
for
brederode
though
neither
nell
nor
the
replied
and
i
asked
myself
by
whose
side
he
was
planning
to
walk
had
he
proposed
the
excursion
with
an
eye
to
monopolizing
the
english
or
the
american
angel
i
stifled
the
pang
which
i
could
not
help
feeling
at
the
thought
that
he
should
have
either
and
in
a
low
voice
asked
freule
menela
van
der
windt
if
i
might
be
her
cavalier
in
order
to
continue
our
very
interesting
argument
i
had
already
forgotten
what
the
last
one
was
about
but
that
was
a
detail
had
she
been
a
little
less
i
think
she
would
have
bridled
as
it
was
she
really
did
smirk
a
little
in
a
ladylike
way
we
took
cabs
and
drove
out
past
all
that
was
commercial
to
the
place
where
the
began
to
be
prettiest
and
the
illuminations
the
most
fantastic
i
was
in
a
cab
with
the
fiancée
and
her
prospective
but
when
we
got
out
to
walk
i
flung
the
twins
to
the
chaperon
and
alone
with
the
young
lady
from
the
hague
she
never
lets
you
forget
for
five
minutes
together
that
she
is
from
the
hague
i
slackened
my
pace
and
regulated
hers
to
it
that
we
might
drop
behind
the
others
the
and
the
canal
were
beautiful
and
fantastic
as
some
night
picture
of
venice
a
faint
mist
had
risen
out
of
the
water
at
sunset
and
the
red
green
and
gold
lamps
suspended
from
trees
and
barges
seemed
to
hang
in
it
like
jewels
caught
in
a
veil
of
gauze
the
trees
arched
over
us
tenderly
bending
as
if
to
listen
to
words
of
love
the
soft
that
hovered
in
the
air
made
lovely
faces
irresistible
and
plain
ones
tolerable
any
normal
man
would
have
been
impelled
to
propose
to
the
nearest
pretty
girl
whether
he
had
been
previously
in
love
with
her
or
not
and
the
nearest
pretty
girl
would
have
said
yes
yes
without
stopping
to
think
about
her
feelings
freule
menela
van
der
windt
is
not
pretty
but
without
her
she
looked
almost
piquant
in
the
pink
lights
and
blue
shadows
which
laced
our
features
as
we
passed
for
which
i
was
devoutly
thankful
as
it
made
my
task
comparatively
easy
i
found
her
softer
more
feminine
more
sympathetic
than
she
had
been
in
the
hotel
she
would
she
said
like
to
see
america
and
that
gave
me
my
chance
it
was
a
pity
i
told
her
that
such
an
intelligent
and
young
lady
should
not
travel
about
the
world
before
settling
down
in
such
a
small
though
charming
country
as
holland
instantly
she
caught
me
up
with
a
little
laugh
why
should
you
take
it
for
granted
that
i
am
going
to
down
anywhere
oh
said
i
rather
embarrassed
at
this
direct
attack
i
er
was
told
that
van
buren
had
been
lucky
enough
to
persuade
you
to
live
in
rotterdam
never
exclaimed
freule
menela
deeply
interested
in
this
conversation
about
herself
i
will
never
live
in
rotterdam
but
i
ventured
with
an
air
of
eagerness
if
you
should
marry
a
man
whose
interests
are
in
rotterdam
it
is
at
all
decided
that
i
shall
marry
such
a
man
she
answered
sharply
not
decided
i
repeated
anxiously
look
here
you
know
i
think
it
fair
to
other
men
that
it
should
be
taken
for
granted
engaged
if
you
not
really
why
should
it
matter
to
other
men
asked
the
lady
oh
well
it
might
you
see
there
might
er
be
some
man
who
met
you
for
the
first
time
after
he
heard
of
your
engagement
and
who
for
his
own
peace
of
mind
did
dare
let
himself
admire
your
brilliant
talents
as
much
as
he
would
like
to
now
i
had
got
as
far
as
i
intended
to
go
some
dim
idea
of
rescuing
the
viking
from
the
girl
he
does
love
to
give
him
to
the
girl
he
does
and
i
do
had
been
floating
in
my
mind
ever
since
that
stormy
night
at
enkhuisen
i
had
thought
that
freule
menela
was
the
sort
of
girl
who
might
drop
the
meat
for
the
sake
of
the
shadow
but
having
indicated
the
presence
of
a
floating
ghostly
shadow
which
might
belong
to
any
one
or
no
one
i
had
no
idea
of
advancing
further
even
to
bestow
happiness
on
phyllis
i
had
argued
with
my
conscience
if
she
a
woman
who
ready
to
throw
over
the
man
she
engaged
to
just
because
he
is
very
rich
or
particularly
eligible
in
her
eyes
and
because
some
other
vague
person
looming
on
the
horizon
has
more
money
than
number
one
why
it
a
sure
sign
that
she
accepted
number
one
because
she
could
get
any
one
else
therefore
she
does
deserve
to
keep
him
and
she
does
deserve
not
only
to
see
him
slip
away
but
to
see
the
shadow
go
with
him
however
i
had
not
taken
freule
menela
talents
into
due
account
or
my
own
failings
is
there
such
a
man
she
asked
there
might
be
i
cautiously
repeated
the
question
is
are
you
engaged
to
van
buren
or
are
you
not
there
has
been
an
understanding
between
his
family
and
mine
for
many
years
that
some
day
we
should
marry
she
answered
and
of
course
he
very
fond
of
me
though
you
might
not
think
it
from
his
manner
he
often
appears
to
feel
more
interest
in
women
for
whom
he
cares
nothing
than
in
me
to
whom
he
is
devoted
that
is
a
characteristic
of
men
who
have
his
reserved
nature
i
afraid
i
do
understand
reserved
natures
said
i
if
i
care
for
any
one
i
ca
help
showing
it
i
have
often
thought
went
on
freule
menela
of
telling
robert
van
buren
that
he
and
i
are
not
suited
to
each
other
my
ideal
man
is
very
different
and
besides
as
i
said
could
induce
me
to
settle
down
in
rotterdam
you
might
make
that
the
determining
point
i
suggested
if
you
were
looking
for
an
excuse
to
save
his
feelings
do
you
really
think
so
she
asked
i
certainly
do
then
you
could
leave
him
the
choice
rotterdam
without
you
the
more
lively
place
with
you
oh
do
you
think
for
your
sake
and
his
you
ought
to
do
this
at
once
and
a
little
for
the
sake
of
the
other
man
she
asked
archly
i
dared
not
inquire
stonily
what
other
man
lest
the
work
i
had
accomplished
should
be
destroyed
in
a
single
stroke
so
i
said
yes
and
for
the
sake
of
the
other
man
you
believe
it
would
really
matter
to
him
she
looked
up
so
anxiously
as
she
put
this
question
that
quite
apart
from
the
interests
of
phyllis
rivers
i
could
not
have
dashed
hers
or
any
other
woman
hopes
by
giving
an
unchivalrous
answer
let
come
what
might
i
could
not
deliberately
bring
the
pallor
of
humiliation
to
a
female
face
especially
after
words
of
mine
had
once
caused
it
to
glow
with
pleasure
how
could
i
believe
otherwise
i
demanded
and
my
tone
sounded
almost
too
sincere
in
my
own
ears
for
a
moment
freule
menela
van
der
windt
did
not
answer
and
i
hoped
that
her
thoughts
had
hopped
to
some
other
branch
of
the
subject
but
presently
she
broke
out
as
if
impelled
by
impulse
to
utter
her
thought
to
a
congenial
soul
is
it
strange
how
sometimes
one
seems
to
know
a
person
one
has
only
just
met
better
than
another
with
whom
one
has
been
intimate
for
years
that
is
often
so
i
hurried
to
assure
her
with
the
idea
of
establishing
the
commonplaceness
of
such
an
experience
you
feel
it
too
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
and
i
answered
yes
before
i
had
time
to
decide
whether
at
this
point
it
would
not
be
safer
not
to
feel
it
i
often
been
told
that
american
men
are
very
impulsive
but
are
there
many
like
you
asked
freule
menela
lots
i
said
quickly
oh
then
it
really
true
that
it
is
quite
a
usual
thing
among
your
country
people
for
a
man
to
tell
a
girl
he
cares
for
her
when
he
has
seen
her
only
once
i
er
really
do
know
about
that
i
answered
beginning
to
be
disturbed
in
soul
you
know
only
how
it
is
with
yourself
freule
menela
murmured
with
a
girlish
laugh
that
betrayed
suppressed
excitement
well
starr
i
think
it
would
be
foolish
to
pretend
to
misunderstand
i
have
heard
much
about
you
perhaps
you
have
heard
a
little
of
me
yet
you
have
taken
me
by
storm
the
thing
i
love
best
is
art
you
are
a
great
artist
and
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
you
have
all
the
fire
of
genius
and
geniuses
have
a
right
to
do
things
which
other
men
may
not
do
i
believe
you
have
made
me
more
interested
in
you
in
these
last
two
hours
we
have
spent
together
than
i
have
been
in
any
one
else
in
as
many
years
and
because
of
you
and
what
you
have
said
so
delicately
yet
so
unmistakably
i
am
going
now
to
take
your
advice
about
robert
before
i
could
stop
her
even
if
i
had
had
the
courage
and
presence
of
mind
she
walked
quickly
away
from
me
and
joined
phyllis
and
van
buren
who
were
sauntering
a
few
yards
ahead
my
brain
whirled
and
threatened
to
give
way
in
the
horror
of
the
situation
i
could
have
shouted
aloud
with
the
shrill
intensity
of
a
drowning
man
alb
save
me
but
alb
was
far
in
front
strolling
with
the
van
buren
twins
while
the
one
van
buren
in
whom
he
is
really
interested
walked
behind
him
with
my
temporary
aunt
and
in
any
case
he
could
have
done
nothing
before
my
stunned
wits
had
time
to
rebound
phyllis
the
sweet
and
gentle
had
turned
and
flown
to
me
as
if
for
refuge
like
a
homing
dove
threatened
by
a
hawk
brother
dear
she
whispered
may
i
walk
with
you
please
freule
menela
says
there
is
something
she
has
been
wanting
all
day
to
talk
over
with
van
buren
so
i
thought
i
had
better
leave
them
alone
and
drop
behind
with
you
if
you
do
mind
having
me
mind
i
echoed
in
my
turmoil
of
spirit
it
a
happy
relief
i
thought
you
seemed
quite
fascinated
by
freule
menela
exclaimed
the
poor
innocent
one
i
asked
van
buren
if
he
were
not
jealous
how
unkind
of
you
i
did
mean
to
be
unkind
at
least
i
i
did
said
phyllis
only
do
you
know
dear
brother
since
i
am
to
confide
my
real
feelings
to
you
i
never
quite
sure
of
myself
where
that
girl
is
concerned
i
ca
stand
her
i
sorry
for
poor
van
buren
what
do
you
suppose
he
answered
when
i
asked
him
that
question
about
being
jealous
of
you
that
rather
naughty
question
he
said
to
heaven
she
were
his
not
mine
had
i
been
on
lawrence
gridiron
i
could
not
have
helped
chortling
i
not
at
all
sure
she
is
i
muttered
under
my
breath
but
phyllis
caught
the
words
what
do
you
mean
she
gasped
oh
it
be
you
mean
anything
you
well
anyhow
i
mean
that
it
very
likely
she
wo
long
be
his
i
explained
fired
with
anxiety
to
please
the
girl
at
any
cost
it
sounds
too
glorious
to
be
true
it
be
true
but
if
it
could
it
no
use
saying
i
would
be
glad
for
poor
van
buren
sake
he
so
much
too
nice
for
her
mercenary
conceited
selfish
little
creature
right
on
every
count
said
i
i
do
quite
understand
you
said
phyllis
but
i
ca
help
feeling
that
if
anything
splendid
does
happen
it
will
be
all
through
you
somehow
you
promised
me
did
you
well
i
do
know
exactly
what
you
promised
but
it
made
me
feel
happy
and
sure
everything
would
come
out
well
that
night
when
you
said
you
like
to
have
me
for
a
sister
i
say
that
i
asked
in
surprise
you
i
thought
go
on
thinking
so
then
i
sighed
and
anything
else
that
will
make
you
happy
little
sister
thank
you
now
i
know
by
the
mysterious
way
you
looking
at
me
that
you
done
something
i
believe
you
made
him
i
mean
van
buren
come
to
see
us
again
sooner
than
he
intended
to
perhaps
and
perhaps
i
made
him
bring
freule
menela
with
him
did
you
i
wish
but
no
i
must
think
of
that
wait
a
few
hours
and
then
think
what
you
like
said
i
yet
i
spoke
gloomily
i
could
see
where
the
viking
was
to
come
in
but
i
could
not
so
clearly
see
how
i
was
to
get
out
we
walked
a
very
long
way
before
any
one
seemed
to
wonder
where
we
were
going
and
why
we
should
be
going
there
but
at
last
we
came
to
a
or
a
or
both
and
the
said
that
we
must
stop
and
give
tibe
a
bowl
of
milk
not
a
member
of
the
party
who
did
not
appear
singularly
on
stopping
and
grouping
with
the
others
again
not
excepting
tibe
himself
but
his
was
caused
only
by
the
antics
of
a
which
he
would
have
liked
to
see
added
to
his
milk
when
it
occurred
to
him
to
drink
the
milk
unenriched
by
such
an
addition
we
were
all
eating
pink
and
white
ices
and
dutch
cakes
that
must
have
been
delicious
to
those
who
had
no
freule
menela
sticking
in
their
throats
phyllis
walked
beside
me
all
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
and
was
dearer
than
ever
now
that
through
my
own
quixotic
act
i
saw
her
rapidly
becoming
unattainable
but
as
the
ladies
said
to
us
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
freule
van
der
windt
contrived
to
whisper
as
she
slipped
her
hand
into
mine
for
better
for
worse
i
taken
advice
starr
i
am
absolutely
how
did
you
manage
it
i
heard
myself
asking
robert
on
living
in
rotterdam
he
would
even
consent
to
winter
at
the
hague
though
it
so
near
so
his
blood
is
on
his
own
head
and
joy
in
his
heart
i
might
have
added
but
i
did
not
speak
at
all
have
you
to
say
she
asked
coyly
though
her
eyes
as
they
fixed
mine
were
not
coy
but
eager
and
i
felt
eerily
that
she
was
wondering
whether
the
millions
of
which
she
heard
were
in
english
pounds
or
american
dollars
i
hesitated
if
i
replied
nothing
she
would
probably
snatch
robert
back
from
phyllis
lips
and
i
had
not
gone
so
far
along
the
path
of
villainy
to
fail
my
angel
now
i
will
tell
you
what
i
have
to
say
i
answered
in
a
low
voice
and
then
i
am
afraid
that
to
be
convincing
i
almost
squeezed
her
hand
xxx
we
were
called
early
in
the
morning
to
take
the
twins
and
freule
menela
the
fiancée
no
longer
for
a
drive
through
utrecht
to
see
the
beautiful
parks
and
the
cathedral
before
starting
on
the
day
journey
since
the
making
of
this
plan
however
many
things
were
changed
robert
and
menela
were
both
disengaged
and
how
they
would
think
it
decorous
to
behave
to
each
other
how
the
twins
would
treat
the
lady
if
the
truth
had
been
revealed
remained
to
be
seen
if
i
had
had
no
personal
interest
at
stake
i
should
have
found
pleasure
in
the
situation
and
in
watching
how
things
shaped
themselves
but
as
it
was
i
realized
that
i
might
be
one
of
the
things
to
be
shaped
and
that
i
should
be
lucky
if
i
were
allowed
to
shape
myself
i
thought
it
well
to
be
late
to
breakfast
lest
the
erstwhile
fiancée
and
i
should
meet
and
it
was
evident
at
a
glance
that
lisbeth
and
lilli
already
knew
all
the
admirable
menela
had
probably
told
them
in
their
bedroom
over
night
thus
giving
the
pair
plenty
of
solid
food
for
dreams
and
the
pretty
creatures
were
pale
and
nervous
not
knowing
how
to
bear
themselves
after
the
earthquake
which
had
shaken
the
relationship
of
years
robert
also
was
uneasy
but
to
my
regret
emotion
enhanced
his
good
looks
what
i
had
done
had
not
been
done
for
his
benefit
i
had
not
jeopardized
my
happiness
to
make
him
more
attractive
to
give
fire
to
his
eyes
and
an
expression
of
manly
striving
with
passion
to
his
already
absurdly
perfect
features
though
plainly
he
was
undergoing
some
mental
crisis
he
held
his
feelings
so
well
in
leash
that
no
outsider
could
have
judged
whether
he
were
the
saddest
or
the
happiest
of
men
and
his
sisters
watched
him
anxiously
hoping
to
receive
a
guiding
clue
for
their
own
behavior
as
for
freule
menela
she
was
as
composed
as
ever
and
had
a
air
as
though
having
slept
on
it
she
was
more
pleased
than
ever
with
the
course
she
had
adopted
phyllis
knew
nothing
yet
except
what
she
had
gleaned
from
me
last
night
i
was
sure
of
that
but
i
was
not
so
sure
about
alb
who
wore
a
clouded
brow
whether
he
was
worrying
over
his
own
affairs
or
whether
friend
robert
had
commandered
his
hero
sympathy
i
could
not
guess
and
dared
not
ask
nor
had
i
much
time
to
speculate
upon
alb
business
for
i
saw
by
freule
menela
eye
that
my
own
was
pressing
and
all
my
energies
were
bent
in
steering
clear
of
her
during
the
excursion
through
utrecht
luckily
the
party
distributed
itself
in
two
carriages
and
though
i
could
not
resist
the
fair
menela
come
with
me
starr
fortunately
the
jumped
in
with
tibe
whose
mood
was
so
obstreperous
that
clearly
he
did
not
find
canal
life
relaxing
then
arose
a
discussion
between
nell
and
phyllis
as
to
which
should
sit
in
the
other
carriage
and
nell
came
to
us
wishing
perhaps
to
avoid
alb
whose
society
seems
of
late
to
cast
a
blight
of
silence
upon
her
now
said
i
to
myself
if
the
late
fiancée
ca
wind
her
tentacles
round
a
new
victim
in
this
vehicle
neither
can
robert
escape
her
toils
by
proposing
to
phyllis
in
that
one
surrounded
by
his
family
circle
if
he
does
seize
his
chance
soon
he
miss
it
forever
because
once
his
freule
discovers
that
she
is
to
be
claimed
by
another
find
it
convenient
to
change
her
mind
about
life
in
rotterdam
i
may
be
saint
or
villain
enough
to
keep
her
dangling
till
sunset
but
then
at
latest
i
shall
have
to
cut
her
down
and
woe
to
any
viking
who
happens
to
lie
about
loose
and
unattached
when
she
falls
to
earth
with
a
dull
thud
far
be
it
from
the
clever
lady
of
the
hague
to
admit
that
there
was
a
place
on
earth
of
which
she
did
not
know
everything
and
though
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
she
never
saw
utrecht
till
yesterday
she
was
so
busy
telling
us
about
it
that
we
were
behind
the
others
in
arriving
on
board
mascotte
our
appointed
rendezvous
i
noticed
instantly
that
phyllis
was
not
on
deck
helping
alb
to
entertain
the
twins
as
her
kind
soul
would
have
prompted
her
to
do
of
course
she
might
be
below
in
one
of
the
cabins
but
where
was
robert
it
was
a
coincidence
that
he
too
should
be
missing
yet
no
one
attempted
to
offer
an
explanation
lilli
and
lisbeth
merely
looked
flurried
and
pink
when
freule
menela
came
airily
on
board
with
me
and
alb
appeared
interested
in
giving
instructions
to
hendrik
who
disputed
respectfully
with
tibe
possession
of
countless
yards
of
his
beloved
cotton
waste
at
last
however
i
began
to
wonder
why
we
did
not
get
away
the
trip
was
to
be
a
return
to
amsterdam
not
with
the
object
of
reviving
impressions
of
that
city
but
for
the
pleasure
of
the
run
through
the
river
vecht
which
alb
praised
as
the
prettiest
stream
in
the
netherlands
and
named
a
miniature
thames
it
was
ten
and
as
usual
we
were
timed
to
start
at
ten
but
i
did
not
consider
it
my
place
to
ask
the
reason
why
or
any
other
question
about
starting
mine
but
to
do
or
die
and
keep
out
of
reach
of
freule
menela
it
was
through
nell
that
the
mystery
was
solved
as
we
stood
chatting
on
deck
where
phil
she
inquired
of
the
twins
gone
back
to
the
hotel
to
find
something
she
forgot
to
pack
said
lilli
and
brother
robert
has
taken
her
said
lisbeth
with
a
fleeting
glance
at
the
fiancée
this
revelation
of
phyllis
diplomacy
came
upon
me
with
a
shock
she
is
such
a
angel
but
i
suppose
all
girls
are
alike
in
some
ways
and
she
is
so
she
must
have
been
anxious
to
put
robert
out
of
his
misery
as
soon
as
she
could
well
she
could
have
done
it
much
sooner
there
they
come
cried
lilli
and
perhaps
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
search
their
faces
for
news
if
freule
menela
had
not
turned
her
back
upon
the
advancing
figures
and
begun
to
talk
with
an
air
of
proprietorship
to
me
it
found
cried
phyllis
to
all
whom
it
might
concern
i
was
so
fond
of
it
i
should
have
hated
losing
it
and
it
was
kind
of
van
buren
to
help
me
i
wondered
whether
there
were
others
on
board
beside
myself
who
detected
in
this
announcement
a
double
meaning
something
in
her
voice
told
me
that
she
really
was
thankful
not
to
have
lost
the
thing
of
which
she
was
so
fond
the
thing
for
which
she
had
gone
back
to
the
hotel
the
thing
van
buren
had
kindly
helped
her
to
find
but
there
was
no
chance
for
a
brother
to
question
his
sister
freule
menela
saw
to
that
it
was
my
luck
at
its
worst
to
be
torn
in
my
mind
on
this
exquisite
day
on
the
vecht
once
in
a
while
it
dimly
comes
back
to
me
that
in
a
past
existence
unbrightened
by
nell
van
buren
and
phyllis
rivers
i
came
to
holland
with
the
object
of
painting
pictures
never
since
my
arrival
in
the
bright
little
country
of
wide
spaces
have
i
had
a
keener
incentive
to
improve
the
shining
hours
but
how
can
a
man
remember
that
he
an
artist
when
the
girl
he
loves
has
engaged
herself
to
another
man
and
one
of
the
few
girls
he
never
could
love
is
rapidly
engaging
herself
to
him
it
was
in
not
a
real
desire
for
work
that
i
fled
to
waterspin
and
screened
myself
behind
easel
and
canvas
and
then
it
was
but
to
find
that
i
had
jumped
from
the
into
the
fire
my
move
was
made
while
mascotte
and
her
fat
companion
lay
at
rest
that
alb
might
buy
fruit
for
us
from
a
fruit
boat
and
freule
menela
also
availed
herself
of
the
quiet
interval
may
i
come
and
watch
you
paint
she
asked
in
a
tone
which
showed
that
vanity
made
her
sure
of
a
welcome
i
longed
for
the
brutal
courage
to
say
that
i
could
never
work
with
an
audience
but
i
remembered
letting
slip
last
night
the
fact
that
i
constantly
sat
sketching
on
the
deck
of
mascotte
during
the
most
crowded
hours
of
life
i
murmured
something
with
a
smile
which
needed
oiling
and
accepting
the
grudging
help
of
my
hand
she
floated
across
with
an
affected
little
scream
i
saw
a
lovely
picture
you
painted
for
miss
rivers
she
said
when
she
was
settled
in
a
at
my
side
will
you
do
one
for
me
with
pleasure
i
answered
this
one
shall
be
for
you
but
if
you
want
it
to
be
good
we
must
talk
i
shall
have
to
concentrate
my
mind
on
my
work
thanks
for
the
compliment
she
laughed
i
give
you
leave
to
forget
me
for
a
little
while
so
i
did
my
best
to
take
her
at
her
word
and
tried
impressionist
sketches
of
the
charming
and
scene
upon
which
her
presence
was
the
sole
blot
the
beautiful
old
houses
set
back
from
the
river
on
flowery
lawns
faded
glowing
red
and
blue
and
gold
over
quaint
doorways
shaded
by
splendid
trees
fairy
villas
rising
from
billows
of
pink
peonies
and
green
hydrangeas
humble
cottages
with
tiny
of
twinkling
glass
shining
out
from
bowers
of
late
roses
windmills
beckoning
across
piles
of
golden
hay
above
clouds
like
flocks
of
snowy
sheep
racing
along
wide
blue
with
the
blue
of
below
a
crystal
flood
foaming
white
with
that
dipped
before
the
prow
of
our
advancing
boat
over
this
crust
of
pearl
poised
always
yellow
lilies
like
hovering
butterflies
and
in
a
clear
space
of
water
each
little
wave
caught
the
sun
and
sky
reflection
so
that
it
seemed
rimmed
with
gold
and
set
with
a
big
oval
turquoise
well
have
i
pleased
you
freule
menela
asked
at
last
illustration
well
have
i
pleased
you
freule
menela
asked
at
the
moment
had
come
for
an
understanding
with
my
two
hands
unaided
i
had
saved
phyllis
and
now
i
must
save
or
lose
myself
of
course
there
was
no
choice
which
to
do
i
had
played
my
fish
and
caught
it
and
as
it
was
not
the
kind
of
fish
i
liked
for
dinner
i
must
tear
it
off
the
hook
and
throw
it
back
into
the
sea
wriggling
i
told
myself
that
it
was
a
bad
as
well
as
an
unattractive
fish
that
if
i
had
hooked
it
most
surely
it
would
have
bolted
the
beautiful
little
golden
minnow
i
had
been
protecting
still
still
there
it
was
smiling
on
the
hook
that
bad
fish
trusting
the
hand
which
had
caught
and
would
betray
it
it
deserved
nothing
of
that
hand
or
any
other
hand
but
suddenly
i
found
mine
powerless
phyllis
phyllis
i
groaned
in
spirit
you
will
be
my
death
for
to
save
you
i
caught
this
fish
now
i
may
have
to
eat
it
and
it
will
surely
choke
me
before
my
eyes
stretched
a
horrible
vista
of
years
lived
through
with
freule
menela
mean
little
vain
disloyal
freule
menela
by
my
side
contentedly
spending
my
money
and
bearing
my
name
while
i
faded
like
a
lovely
lily
on
the
altar
of
in
another
instant
i
should
have
said
yes
she
had
pleased
me
she
would
have
answered
and
just
because
she
is
a
woman
i
should
have
had
to
say
something
which
she
might
have
taken
as
she
chose
so
that
it
would
have
been
all
over
for
ronald
lester
starr
but
at
this
moment
the
two
boats
began
to
slow
down
i
suppose
that
toon
at
the
of
waterspin
must
have
received
a
message
which
i
was
too
preoccupied
to
hear
and
as
speed
slackened
came
the
voice
which
others
know
as
that
of
my
aunt
fay
never
had
it
been
so
welcome
sounded
so
sweet
as
now
when
it
brought
my
reprieve
ronald
dear
cooed
the
accents
you
better
get
ready
at
once
to
lunch
on
shore
for
jonkheer
brederode
has
another
surprise
for
us
and
i
know
that
by
this
time
your
hands
if
not
your
face
are
covered
with
paint
wonderful
woman
it
was
as
if
inspiration
had
sent
her
to
my
rescue
not
that
i
am
at
all
sure
she
would
have
laid
herself
out
to
rescue
me
from
any
snare
had
she
known
of
its
existence
for
though
before
the
watery
world
i
am
ronny
dear
to
her
she
is
not
as
considerate
with
me
in
private
as
she
used
to
be
when
we
first
started
we
have
been
frank
with
each
other
at
times
the
and
i
and
the
pot
has
said
in
plain
words
what
it
thinks
of
the
kettle
true
character
when
the
time
comes
for
us
to
part
it
may
be
that
her
little
ladyship
will
be
still
more
frank
and
let
me
know
in
polite
language
that
seeing
the
last
of
her
borrowed
nephew
is
good
riddance
of
bad
rubbish
nevertheless
her
extraordinary
though
indescribable
cleverness
has
woven
a
kind
of
web
about
us
all
and
whether
i
am
able
to
respect
the
or
not
i
was
conscious
of
passionate
gratitude
to
her
as
she
arrested
me
with
the
bad
fish
to
my
mouth
the
boats
stopped
at
a
private
landing
small
but
so
remarkable
that
i
thought
for
an
instant
the
whole
thing
must
be
an
optical
illusion
we
had
come
to
rest
in
the
deep
shadow
of
enormous
trees
leaning
over
the
rail
of
a
snug
little
harbor
two
dummy
men
in
rakish
hats
and
dark
coats
stared
at
the
new
arrivals
with
eyes
and
the
dummies
and
the
wooden
wall
on
which
they
were
propped
with
a
strange
painted
motto
consisting
of
snakes
and
dogs
and
sticks
and
a
yard
measure
were
all
repeated
with
precision
in
the
green
mirror
of
quiet
water
how
annoying
just
as
we
were
going
to
have
another
delicious
talk
exclaimed
menela
yes
said
i
but
it
ca
be
helped
where
are
we
is
this
fairyland
it
must
be
the
place
of
heer
dudok
de
wit
answered
the
young
lady
snappily
he
is
a
wonderful
man
and
many
people
say
that
no
visit
to
holland
can
be
complete
without
a
visit
to
his
house
he
a
great
character
has
walked
all
over
the
world
and
brought
back
curiosities
for
his
museum
to
which
he
gives
free
admission
and
from
what
i
hear
there
is
nothing
else
he
wo
give
if
asked
for
it
he
so
generous
from
a
night
lodging
or
all
his
best
peaches
up
to
a
present
of
a
thousand
gulden
to
a
distressed
stranger
this
can
be
no
other
house
than
his
and
i
believe
rudolph
brederode
is
a
cousin
of
heer
de
wit
just
as
rudolph
is
of
mine
on
the
other
side
i
do
see
our
host
though
perhaps
he
is
away
on
one
of
his
walking
tours
or
in
bed
said
i
taking
a
nap
to
forget
the
heat
no
for
one
of
his
peculiarities
is
never
to
go
to
bed
he
has
been
in
bed
for
years
i
do
know
how
he
sleeps
but
look
there
he
is
now
i
recognize
him
from
photographs
in
newspapers
my
eyes
followed
her
nod
which
appeared
to
be
aimed
at
the
river
i
looked
for
a
boat
but
spied
a
head
floating
among
it
was
not
a
loose
head
of
some
early
dutch
martyr
miraculously
preserved
as
seemed
possible
in
a
place
of
such
surprises
for
it
smiled
and
bowed
and
addressed
brederode
as
its
dear
rudolph
its
wet
hair
glittering
like
silver
in
the
water
was
rather
long
its
eyes
were
like
brown
jewels
it
had
faultless
features
not
at
all
of
a
modern
cast
but
like
those
one
sees
in
a
portrait
and
its
smile
even
when
visible
only
as
far
down
as
the
lower
lip
was
charming
the
famous
dudok
de
wit
bobbing
nearer
explained
that
he
had
unduly
prolonged
his
daily
swimming
bath
owing
to
the
sultriness
of
the
day
as
it
was
he
had
been
in
the
water
no
more
than
an
hour
or
two
but
he
was
delighted
to
see
us
would
come
out
at
once
and
expect
us
to
lunch
with
him
at
breukelen
which
is
the
name
of
his
place
he
did
come
out
in
a
neat
desiring
us
to
follow
him
into
the
house
where
we
might
amuse
ourselves
until
he
was
dressed
wandering
among
his
treasures
in
the
the
luncheon
in
the
quaint
old
house
the
stroll
through
the
grounds
and
the
hour
in
the
museum
were
among
alb
successes
but
i
was
past
grudging
it
to
him
besides
he
flaunted
no
triumphant
airs
why
should
he
when
phyllis
had
eyes
only
for
her
viking
and
nell
in
a
newly
developed
appreciation
of
her
twin
cousins
had
no
time
to
remember
his
existence
i
did
think
that
she
might
have
stretched
out
a
hand
to
save
me
from
menela
but
if
she
had
any
conception
of
what
was
going
on
she
thought
me
able
to
take
care
of
myself
and
i
should
have
been
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
creature
i
had
freed
had
it
not
been
for
the
during
the
afternoon
when
we
had
left
breukelen
and
were
gliding
on
along
the
river
toward
amsterdam
she
unobtrusively
made
it
her
business
to
protect
me
from
the
sallies
of
the
enemy
even
engaging
that
enemy
herself
as
if
she
were
my
squire
at
arms
now
if
never
before
she
was
worth
her
weight
in
gold
and
as
i
saw
her
politely
entangle
the
unwilling
menela
in
conversation
i
vowed
to
buy
her
a
present
worth
having
when
we
arrived
in
amsterdam
xxxi
when
a
man
sacrifices
himself
for
a
woman
he
naturally
likes
to
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
he
has
made
a
success
and
i
felt
that
a
melancholy
pleasure
would
be
mine
should
i
learn
that
phyllis
had
profited
by
my
kindness
it
would
have
been
flattering
to
my
also
though
perhaps
disastrous
to
my
ribs
if
robert
van
buren
had
thrown
himself
upon
my
bosom
thanking
me
for
his
deliverance
from
bondage
i
had
to
remind
myself
that
he
could
not
possibly
know
what
he
owed
me
or
i
should
have
been
unjust
enough
to
accuse
him
of
ingratitude
a
heavy
shower
came
on
while
we
were
driving
in
open
cabs
through
amsterdam
therefore
the
moment
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
of
our
last
visit
the
various
members
of
the
band
had
to
skurry
off
to
their
rooms
and
change
their
drenched
garments
as
no
plan
of
campaign
had
been
arranged
for
the
rest
of
the
day
it
was
then
past
five
we
did
not
meet
again
as
a
party
until
when
we
all
came
together
with
the
exception
of
brederode
who
absented
himself
to
dine
with
a
friend
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
away
and
to
my
surprise
i
discovered
that
when
a
mariner
has
carried
an
albatross
about
with
him
week
after
week
he
actually
misses
the
creature
if
he
mislays
it
somehow
we
seemed
to
be
at
loose
ends
without
brederode
lacking
an
organizer
nobody
knew
what
to
do
and
if
he
had
wished
to
enhance
his
value
he
could
have
chosen
a
better
way
as
if
at
a
loss
for
any
other
subject
of
common
interest
we
fell
to
talking
of
the
absent
one
all
save
nell
who
listened
in
silence
not
once
joining
in
until
freule
menela
capped
an
anecdote
of
robert
in
praise
of
his
hero
by
remarking
of
course
rudolph
brave
enough
but
that
no
particular
credit
to
him
all
brederodes
have
been
brave
since
the
days
of
the
water
beggar
but
i
afraid
he
quite
aware
of
that
and
all
his
other
perfections
he
rather
conceited
and
as
for
obstinacy
then
at
last
nell
had
something
to
say
for
herself
does
it
strike
you
she
asked
with
elaborate
sweetness
that
a
person
may
have
and
firmness
without
being
either
obstinate
or
conceited
well
exclaimed
robert
in
the
pause
which
followed
that
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
you
defend
rudolph
cousin
helen
he
has
proved
himself
such
a
faithful
skipper
that
it
my
duty
as
the
owner
of
the
boat
to
defend
the
good
qualities
which
have
served
us
best
replied
nell
looking
so
brilliantly
pretty
with
her
flushed
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
that
i
felt
there
might
still
be
consolations
in
life
for
me
if
only
i
could
attain
them
the
situation
was
now
becoming
strained
on
all
sides
not
that
it
was
made
so
by
the
conversation
i
have
just
set
down
but
by
the
peculiar
relations
of
several
persons
in
the
party
the
original
plan
of
the
visit
was
that
having
arrived
at
utrecht
they
should
be
taken
on
by
us
to
rotterdam
before
mascotte
and
waterspin
bore
us
northward
again
to
zeeland
this
roundabout
way
of
journeying
was
the
penalty
of
our
beautiful
day
on
the
vecht
because
to
see
the
vecht
after
utrecht
we
were
obliged
to
land
at
amsterdam
and
as
there
was
no
nearer
way
of
reaching
zeeland
than
by
passing
rotterdam
we
were
not
going
out
of
our
way
in
landing
the
van
buren
party
so
near
home
but
to
go
by
canal
from
amsterdam
to
rotterdam
would
take
us
one
long
day
and
as
we
had
a
pair
of
severed
lovers
among
us
that
long
day
association
on
a
small
boat
would
be
awkward
the
obvious
thing
was
for
robert
to
invent
a
pretext
and
vanish
but
robert
no
doubt
had
his
own
reasons
for
wishing
to
stay
and
besides
he
had
the
excuse
that
he
could
not
go
without
taking
his
sisters
if
his
sisters
went
they
could
not
well
leave
the
friend
they
had
brought
with
them
neither
did
it
seem
practicable
for
her
to
depart
in
their
company
as
she
had
just
jilted
their
brother
who
would
have
to
act
as
escort
for
all
three
this
difficulty
must
have
presented
itself
to
freule
menela
for
she
gave
no
indication
of
a
desire
to
leave
us
perhaps
she
thought
it
better
to
endure
the
ills
she
knew
than
fly
to
others
she
knew
not
and
by
way
of
accustoming
herself
to
those
ills
she
kept
unremittingly
near
me
when
after
dinner
we
assembled
in
aunt
fay
inevitable
if
i
were
a
woman
i
should
have
been
on
the
verge
of
hysterics
but
being
handicapped
by
manhood
i
merely
yearned
to
bash
some
one
on
the
head
as
a
relief
to
my
feelings
and
lest
that
some
one
should
be
freule
menela
at
last
i
got
to
my
feet
and
announced
my
intention
of
taking
a
walk
in
the
rain
what
would
i
give
to
go
with
you
exclaimed
the
young
lady
so
close
here
and
i
had
no
exercise
i
am
fond
of
walking
in
the
rain
i
will
chaperon
you
said
the
oh
we
need
not
trouble
you
lady
macnairne
protested
menela
it
might
give
you
rheumatism
and
girls
in
holland
are
allowed
to
be
very
independent
my
heart
sank
how
could
even
the
ever
resourceful
get
round
that
sharp
corner
she
was
equal
to
it
you
are
very
considerate
she
replied
but
i
am
and
used
to
ways
and
in
scotland
even
persons
like
myself
are
used
also
to
walking
in
the
rain
otherwise
we
should
seldom
walk
at
all
indeed
we
rather
like
rain
in
pleasant
company
with
this
she
got
up
briskly
and
it
was
as
a
trio
that
we
had
our
wet
walk
through
the
streets
of
amsterdam
the
shops
were
still
bright
however
and
i
stopped
my
two
companions
under
their
dripping
umbrellas
in
front
of
a
window
blazing
with
a
display
of
jewelry
now
what
should
you
say
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
of
the
lot
i
asked
that
ring
promptly
answered
menela
pointing
to
a
cabuchon
ruby
of
heart
shape
set
with
clear
white
diamonds
it
was
a
ring
for
a
lover
to
offer
to
his
lady
illustration
was
a
ring
for
a
lover
to
offer
to
his
you
are
right
agreed
the
there
nothing
else
in
the
window
to
touch
that
let
go
in
and
buy
it
then
i
said
i
have
a
friend
to
whom
i
should
like
to
make
a
little
present
little
present
echoed
menela
it
will
cost
you
three
thousand
gulden
at
the
least
that
is
not
too
costly
considering
everything
said
i
mysteriously
and
i
was
bubbling
with
malicious
joy
as
by
right
of
purchase
the
ring
became
mine
each
one
of
them
considers
it
as
good
as
hers
i
said
to
myself
evening
at
rotterdam
if
i
am
safely
spared
from
freule
menela
and
she
is
gone
out
of
my
life
forever
that
ring
may
change
hands
but
it
wo
go
to
the
hague
i
dreamed
all
night
that
i
was
pursued
by
robert
escaped
fiancée
and
dodging
her
ran
into
the
arms
of
sir
alec
macnairne
who
denounced
me
fiercely
as
a
murderer
nor
was
there
much
relief
in
awaking
for
i
knew
that
in
her
room
divided
from
me
only
by
a
friendly
wall
or
two
freule
menela
lay
planning
how
to
trap
me
if
i
am
to
be
saved
i
said
to
myself
i
afraid
it
wo
be
by
my
own
courage
or
resource
i
must
look
to
my
aunt
she
fought
for
me
nobly
all
day
but
there
are
still
twelve
hours
of
danger
with
her
and
menela
it
a
case
of
greek
meeting
greek
will
she
be
clever
enough
to
pull
me
through
xxxii
i
knew
i
looked
haggard
and
hoped
i
looked
interesting
when
i
appeared
in
the
big
hall
of
the
hotel
after
breakfast
in
the
morning
ten
minutes
before
the
time
at
which
we
were
to
start
for
rotterdam
there
were
the
twins
talking
to
nell
there
was
brederode
studying
a
map
of
the
waterways
there
was
the
teaching
tibe
a
trick
which
for
days
he
had
been
mildly
declining
to
learn
there
were
phyllis
and
the
viking
wrapt
in
each
other
in
the
seclusion
of
a
corner
but
where
was
freule
menela
i
asked
the
question
aloud
and
she
gone
announced
the
lady
who
is
not
my
aunt
gone
i
echoed
yes
home
to
the
hague
she
had
a
telegram
and
was
obliged
to
leave
at
once
by
the
first
train
instead
of
waiting
to
travel
slowly
with
us
oh
said
i
adding
hypocritically
what
a
pity
the
small
and
rather
pretty
mouth
of
the
arched
upward
so
i
suppose
she
smiled
yes
is
it
said
she
nobody
else
spoke
but
i
felt
that
the
silence
of
robert
and
the
twins
was
more
eloquent
than
words
when
i
had
overcome
the
first
giddy
rapture
of
returning
life
and
was
sure
that
i
was
steady
on
my
feet
i
dared
to
dally
with
the
subject
i
asked
if
bad
news
had
come
for
freule
menela
expressed
devout
relief
that
it
had
not
and
piped
regret
at
being
deprived
of
a
farewell
she
left
a
message
explained
the
i
saw
her
off
as
was
my
duty
since
she
did
not
care
to
disturb
dear
nell
so
early
in
the
morning
you
see
i
alone
was
in
her
confidence
i
knew
last
night
after
you
had
all
gone
to
bed
that
the
telegram
come
and
i
promised
if
it
did
to
go
with
her
to
the
station
remind
me
to
give
you
the
message
when
we
started
as
she
said
this
i
felt
instinctively
that
i
should
have
seen
deep
meaning
in
her
eyes
were
they
not
hidden
by
their
blue
glasses
and
curiosity
to
know
the
worst
battled
with
reluctance
to
hear
it
perhaps
it
was
well
that
at
this
moment
alb
gathered
us
for
a
start
and
that
there
was
no
chance
for
private
conversation
in
the
carriage
which
took
nell
one
of
the
twins
and
the
chaperon
with
me
to
the
rowing
and
yachting
club
where
mascotte
and
waterspin
awaited
us
this
respite
gave
me
time
to
get
on
my
armor
and
fasten
up
several
if
not
all
the
buckles
some
of
which
i
realized
were
lamentably
weak
on
board
there
was
the
usual
business
of
putting
our
belongings
to
rights
after
an
absence
on
shore
and
when
i
came
on
to
mascotte
from
waterspin
already
amsterdam
with
its
smoke
cloud
and
widespreading
mass
of
buildings
like
gray
bubbles
against
the
clear
sky
was
sinking
out
of
sight
we
were
comfortably
along
a
modest
canal
leading
us
southward
and
alb
was
explaining
to
the
and
the
van
buren
girls
that
to
reach
rotterdam
by
the
shortest
way
he
meant
to
avoid
the
places
we
had
seen
aalsmeer
with
its
menagerie
of
little
and
the
great
polder
suddenly
as
the
motor
speed
increased
after
taking
me
on
phyllis
left
robert
and
nell
to
come
to
my
side
a
look
from
her
beautiful
eyes
warned
me
that
something
interesting
was
due
and
by
one
accord
we
moved
as
far
as
possible
from
our
friends
best
of
brothers
she
whispered
i
been
dying
to
thank
you
at
last
my
chance
has
come
you
are
wonderful
you
you
would
you
know
and
that
i
was
to
trust
you
but
i
never
thought
you
how
did
you
do
it
with
my
little
hatchet
i
answered
dreamily
her
eyes
opened
wide
your
what
it
needed
a
sharp
instrument
said
i
but
how
did
you
know
it
was
mine
you
were
with
her
so
much
and
had
so
many
private
talks
i
felt
you
had
a
plan
but
i
could
only
not
expect
do
tell
me
everything
suppose
you
tell
everything
i
bargained
we
may
be
playing
at
cross
purposes
what
has
happened
to
you
i
engaged
said
phyllis
is
it
glorious
i
do
know
that
i
should
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
replied
wondering
why
my
heart
was
not
aching
harder
perhaps
then
you
never
been
in
love
she
suggested
oh
have
i
i
been
in
nothing
else
lately
except
hot
water
you
do
say
such
odd
things
but
i
bless
you
if
i
ca
understand
you
you
made
me
happy
you
did
tell
me
you
were
in
love
with
robert
of
course
not
it
would
have
been
too
bold
even
to
tell
myself
when
he
was
engaged
to
some
one
else
but
pity
akin
to
love
is
it
and
there
was
no
harm
in
pitying
him
because
he
was
bound
to
a
a
who
could
never
deserve
his
love
even
if
he
had
given
it
to
you
that
was
was
it
but
if
it
had
been
for
my
clever
brother
we
could
never
have
belonged
to
each
other
some
men
are
born
brothers
some
achieve
brotherhood
others
have
it
thrust
upon
them
i
muttered
you
and
he
had
better
take
advantage
of
the
lull
to
be
married
i
said
aloud
the
lull
in
freule
menela
she
be
hailing
and
thundering
and
lightning
soon
oh
do
you
think
she
try
to
get
robert
back
again
gasped
phyllis
unless
another
and
riper
fruit
drops
into
her
mouth
as
if
it
would
you
frighten
me
robert
did
beg
last
night
that
marry
him
almost
at
once
and
not
go
back
to
england
unless
on
our
honeymoon
i
told
him
i
would
think
of
such
a
thing
but
perhaps
oh
we
lose
each
other
now
i
do
believe
we
were
made
for
one
another
i
begin
to
believe
so
too
said
i
and
as
that
belief
increased
so
decreased
the
pain
of
my
loss
phyllis
still
is
and
ever
will
be
a
angel
and
when
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
she
makes
cake
in
the
kitchen
of
waterspin
among
the
blue
china
and
brasses
she
is
enough
to
melt
the
heart
of
diogenes
nevertheless
i
can
not
break
mine
at
losing
a
girl
who
was
born
for
a
robert
van
buren
after
all
nell
is
more
bewilderingly
beautiful
and
has
twice
phyllis
magnetism
she
has
too
fine
a
sense
of
humor
to
fall
in
love
with
a
man
inches
and
muscles
that
one
speech
of
phyllis
taught
me
resignation
and
showed
me
in
a
flash
that
despite
her
charms
she
is
somewhat
early
victorian
i
glanced
toward
nell
on
whose
brilliant
face
indifference
to
her
cousin
was
expressed
as
she
stood
talking
to
him
probably
about
himself
and
wondered
how
for
a
little
while
my
worship
could
have
strayed
from
her
to
phyllis
a
girl
born
for
robert
van
buren
a
sense
of
calm
beatific
brotherliness
stole
through
my
veins
nell
had
never
been
so
lovely
or
so
lovable
and
i
resolved
to
find
out
from
my
sister
if
she
still
thought
there
might
be
hope
for
me
in
that
direction
i
should
keep
robert
waiting
i
went
on
without
a
pang
no
telling
what
freule
menela
might
do
she
clever
as
well
as
spiteful
and
poor
robert
is
so
honorable
sighed
phyllis
if
he
known
that
you
were
working
to
to
free
him
he
might
have
felt
it
was
a
plot
and
have
refused
to
accept
his
release
you
do
think
i
ought
to
tell
him
do
you
certainly
not
said
i
that
our
secret
how
good
you
are
well
i
take
your
advice
yet
it
does
seem
so
strange
to
be
married
and
live
in
holland
when
i
never
thought
that
anything
could
be
really
nice
out
of
england
but
robert
seems
to
me
exactly
like
an
englishman
that
why
i
love
him
so
dreadfully
and
i
suppose
you
seem
to
him
exactly
like
a
dutch
girl
and
that
why
he
loves
you
so
dreadfully
was
the
answer
in
my
mind
but
i
kept
it
there
it
might
have
dashed
phyllis
happiness
to
realize
this
truth
if
i
let
robert
make
arrangements
for
our
marriage
almost
at
once
freule
menela
could
get
him
back
could
she
for
he
would
be
more
bound
to
me
than
he
ever
was
to
her
said
my
sister
in
that
line
alone
lies
safety
i
replied
have
you
told
miss
van
buren
your
stepsister
i
mean
oh
yes
as
soon
as
it
happened
of
course
nell
and
i
never
have
secrets
from
each
other
at
least
we
have
till
lately
i
thought
she
would
have
guessed
but
do
you
know
she
she
fancied
from
things
i
said
that
i
was
making
up
my
mind
to
that
is
to
try
and
learn
to
care
for
she
disapproved
of
my
doing
that
it
seems
which
is
the
reason
she
been
so
odd
not
that
she
consider
us
suited
to
each
other
the
other
one
and
i
but
she
thought
with
all
his
faults
he
was
so
much
of
a
man
that
it
was
fair
for
a
girl
to
accept
his
love
if
she
had
to
try
and
learn
to
care
for
him
simply
because
he
happened
to
be
i
see
now
in
the
light
of
this
new
happiness
that
she
was
quite
right
but
i
did
dream
then
that
the
one
man
i
could
care
for
could
ever
be
more
to
me
than
a
dear
friend
and
a
girl
feels
so
humiliated
to
be
thinking
of
a
man
who
engaged
to
some
one
else
she
gets
the
idea
that
the
best
thing
would
be
to
occupy
her
mind
with
another
man
if
there
anybody
who
likes
her
very
much
and
lady
macnairne
has
always
been
hinting
this
last
fortnight
but
oh
no
i
not
thinking
what
i
saying
even
though
you
are
my
brother
i
no
right
to
tell
you
that
sister
i
insist
that
you
shall
tell
me
i
said
with
all
my
native
fierceness
and
phyllis
is
not
a
girl
to
rebel
if
a
male
person
commands
well
then
but
she
is
perhaps
mistaken
i
hope
now
that
she
in
thinking
what
that
that
jonkheer
brederode
cares
more
for
me
than
for
nell
i
wonder
said
i
oh
course
went
on
phyllis
modestly
nell
a
hundred
times
prettier
and
more
interesting
than
i
am
though
thank
goodness
robert
think
so
but
she
snubbed
the
jonkheer
so
dreadfully
at
first
and
then
after
she
changed
and
been
nice
to
him
for
a
day
or
two
she
got
worse
than
ever
at
least
she
hardly
ever
speaks
to
him
at
all
she
just
keeps
out
of
his
way
and
leaves
him
to
others
so
his
may
have
been
hurt
i
ca
say
vanity
as
i
might
with
some
men
because
jonkheer
brederode
is
a
bit
vain
though
he
has
a
right
to
be
and
he
may
have
turned
his
thoughts
toward
one
who
sympathized
with
him
several
little
things
lately
have
looked
as
if
it
were
so
but
i
do
pray
it
not
now
that
i
so
happy
it
would
be
too
hard
if
he
were
to
bear
a
double
disappointment
after
the
trouble
he
has
taken
and
the
sacrifices
he
has
made
leaving
his
beautiful
home
and
all
its
luxuries
and
the
friends
who
appreciate
him
as
a
splendid
fellow
and
a
grand
sportsman
to
be
skipper
week
after
week
on
this
little
boat
you
forget
that
he
has
had
the
privilege
of
society
i
reminded
her
oh
yes
i
know
you
must
be
great
chums
or
he
would
have
come
but
robert
says
what
does
robert
say
nothing
only
that
he
and
jonkheer
brederode
have
known
each
other
so
long
he
thinks
it
odd
never
to
have
heard
him
mention
your
name
as
his
friend
alb
is
singularly
reserved
i
remarked
so
i
said
to
robert
and
he
admitted
it
but
it
was
rather
a
coincidence
that
he
wanted
to
know
us
was
it
however
i
suppose
your
friendship
must
have
made
up
to
him
for
everything
he
suffered
i
did
dread
his
learning
about
robert
and
me
for
fear
it
might
hurt
him
and
robert
did
too
a
little
for
robert
is
so
adorably
foolish
he
thinks
every
one
must
care
for
me
but
he
told
him
this
morning
what
did
alb
say
i
asked
he
congratulated
robert
as
sweetly
as
possible
but
robert
said
his
face
changed
when
he
heard
the
news
i
did
dare
to
look
up
when
the
jonkheer
came
and
made
me
nice
wishes
for
fear
he
might
be
looking
sad
and
there
a
heavy
sound
in
his
voice
i
thought
oh
dear
very
complicated
is
it
yes
i
admitted
even
in
holland
perhaps
these
women
are
right
perhaps
alb
heart
has
been
caught
in
the
rebound
but
lest
it
has
and
he
undertakes
to
cut
me
out
with
nell
it
is
necessary
that
i
lose
no
time
in
using
my
best
wiles
with
her
while
phyllis
was
hanging
in
the
balance
she
was
as
desirable
as
a
rosy
apple
just
out
of
reach
but
now
that
she
is
smugly
satisfied
to
be
in
the
hands
of
another
her
ethereal
charm
is
fled
i
must
congratulate
van
buren
i
said
or
he
will
believe
jealous
so
i
shook
hands
with
the
viking
having
blessed
the
pair
and
was
in
the
act
of
annexing
nell
when
the
alleged
lady
macnairne
found
it
convenient
to
give
me
freule
menela
message
you
wanted
to
hear
it
did
you
she
asked
when
nell
had
drifted
away
to
the
twins
whose
society
though
not
enlivening
she
apparently
preferred
to
poor
alb
i
waited
so
long
that
i
could
have
waited
a
little
longer
i
said
following
the
head
with
wistful
eyes
this
is
your
gratitude
exclaimed
the
you
do
seem
to
realize
that
i
saved
you
i
looked
at
her
only
to
be
baffled
as
usual
by
the
blue
barrier
of
glass
you
do
deserve
all
the
trouble
i
taken
she
went
on
or
that
i
should
tell
you
anything
about
it
come
tibe
let
go
below
darling
doggie
you
spoiled
me
for
everybody
else
are
always
appreciative
nobody
else
is
you
think
that
because
he
happens
to
have
a
tail
to
wag
and
others
have
said
i
i
consider
myself
as
good
as
tibe
any
day
though
handicapped
in
some
ways
i
soon
show
you
that
i
not
ungrateful
when
you
let
me
know
exactly
what
cause
i
have
for
gratitude
have
you
murdered
the
late
fiancée
and
thrown
her
out
of
your
hotel
window
into
the
canal
i
got
rid
of
her
just
as
effectively
returned
the
i
went
and
talked
to
her
in
her
room
last
night
when
she
was
undressing
ugh
but
she
was
plain
in
her
wrapper
it
was
a
pink
flannellet
one
imagine
it
with
her
skin
i
rather
not
said
i
if
it
were
for
me
probably
you
often
have
had
to
see
her
in
it
well
i
made
an
excuse
that
she
looked
tired
and
complained
of
the
noise
under
her
windows
preventing
her
sleeping
i
offered
her
some
trional
and
then
i
just
lingered
she
thought
it
wise
to
be
nice
to
aunt
and
i
turned
the
conversation
to
you
she
said
you
were
charming
i
said
you
would
be
if
you
had
such
a
terrible
temper
i
said
you
were
almost
mad
with
it
sometimes
when
you
were
a
little
boy
yes
i
did
really
you
ought
to
thank
me
i
dare
say
you
a
horrid
little
boy
but
she
did
seem
to
mind
that
much
she
told
me
that
she
got
along
splendidly
with
people
they
were
always
nice
to
her
that
discouraged
me
a
tiny
bit
but
i
had
played
any
really
high
trumps
yet
i
went
on
to
say
you
were
very
delicate
but
she
seemed
quite
pleased
at
that
although
if
she
only
knew
it
she
be
in
black
she
said
she
thought
delicate
men
were
the
most
interesting
so
that
drove
me
to
desperation
and
after
i
praised
you
a
little
just
enough
to
be
realistic
for
an
aunt
i
said
what
a
shame
it
was
about
that
will
of
your
father
she
pricked
up
her
ears
then
and
wanted
to
know
what
i
meant
he
you
i
asked
and
i
was
shocked
to
hear
you
had
because
i
said
it
would
be
more
honest
to
let
people
know
how
one
stood
the
position
being
so
peculiar
your
father
had
left
every
away
from
you
i
said
in
case
you
married
a
foreigner
and
it
was
such
a
blow
that
she
did
even
notice
that
i
committed
an
americanism
she
could
speak
for
a
whole
minute
and
then
she
asked
if
you
had
tried
to
dispute
the
will
that
would
have
been
no
use
said
i
it
was
the
kind
you
could
dispute
you
often
fell
in
love
with
girls
not
americans
but
you
were
bound
to
marry
a
compatriot
in
the
end
unless
you
could
find
a
foreigner
with
enough
money
to
support
you
even
after
all
that
she
held
on
to
you
by
the
ragged
edge
could
you
make
a
lot
of
money
she
asked
with
your
pictures
which
are
so
famous
they
were
i
said
and
though
the
critics
always
praise
them
you
could
hardly
ever
sell
said
i
so
lazy
he
does
paint
a
picture
once
in
three
years
good
heavens
i
exclaimed
what
a
character
you
gave
me
it
a
wonder
she
did
rush
to
robert
van
buren
door
and
cry
to
him
that
she
reconsidered
i
saved
him
too
for
phyllis
sake
it
was
too
late
for
her
to
go
to
him
at
that
hour
or
even
send
a
note
as
i
saw
by
her
eye
she
thought
of
doing
i
stayed
with
her
till
after
twelve
on
purpose
and
the
last
thing
i
said
was
that
i
thought
her
decision
not
to
accept
van
buren
so
wise
as
such
an
intelligent
woman
as
she
might
marry
any
one
it
showed
said
i
how
undeserving
he
was
that
the
minute
she
took
herself
from
him
he
asked
another
girl
to
be
his
wife
he
she
almost
screamed
said
i
you
know
he
is
now
engaged
to
miss
rivers
with
the
approval
of
his
sisters
and
a
telegram
has
been
sent
to
his
mother
telling
her
this
was
news
worth
hearing
and
i
forgave
the
the
inopportuneness
of
her
interruption
with
nell
who
told
you
about
van
buren
engagement
to
phyllis
i
asked
no
one
but
i
thought
they
ought
to
be
engaged
if
they
were
and
knew
they
never
would
be
if
menela
were
got
rid
of
but
about
the
telegram
to
van
buren
the
minute
i
went
to
my
room
i
sent
for
a
waiter
and
wrote
one
without
signing
it
i
hoped
she
think
it
came
from
her
son
and
that
in
his
excitement
he
forgotten
to
put
his
name
she
be
furious
said
i
freule
menela
told
me
and
probably
true
that
her
future
had
done
everything
she
could
to
bring
about
the
match
perhaps
but
she
tremendously
proud
of
robert
so
the
twins
say
once
she
knows
that
menela
deliberately
threw
him
over
she
never
want
him
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
girl
again
and
phyllis
rivers
penniless
you
know
you
paid
a
generous
half
of
the
expenses
of
this
trip
for
which
it
seems
some
money
she
had
left
to
her
was
to
be
used
she
kept
most
of
that
and
she
has
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
sterling
a
year
besides
she
have
enough
for
when
she
and
robert
are
married
and
she
comes
of
very
good
people
her
was
a
viscount
or
baron
or
something
that
will
appeal
to
old
lady
van
buren
when
she
finds
it
out
and
if
nell
should
happen
to
marry
a
rich
man
he
would
be
charmed
to
do
something
for
the
sweet
little
stepsister
i
added
the
turned
on
me
shrewdly
you
seem
to
be
very
sure
of
that
i
suppose
you
judge
him
by
you
think
nell
husband
may
be
a
rich
i
hope
so
said
i
and
a
generous
one
but
talking
of
generosity
i
promised
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
no
less
grateful
than
tibe
though
i
may
not
have
as
effective
ways
of
showing
it
strange
little
of
mine
i
thank
you
for
saving
me
i
realize
that
if
it
were
for
you
freule
van
der
windt
at
all
events
would
have
secured
a
rich
american
husband
no
matter
what
miss
van
buren
luck
may
be
i
do
realize
that
but
for
your
fibs
and
fancies
i
should
have
been
a
lost
man
for
certainly
i
should
not
have
been
equal
to
saving
myself
from
that
woman
by
this
one
night
work
alone
if
by
nothing
else
you
more
than
earned
your
and
extras
that
ring
you
helped
me
choose
last
night
do
go
on
she
cut
me
short
did
i
tell
you
the
other
day
when
you
were
offering
me
a
bribe
that
i
did
want
anything
and
have
it
not
a
diamond
ring
a
pearl
ring
nor
even
a
ruby
ring
i
know
you
think
me
a
mercenary
little
wretch
and
that
you
put
up
with
me
all
this
time
only
because
you
could
do
without
me
while
as
for
you
of
course
you
only
an
in
my
life
still
i
like
you
to
understand
that
i
have
done
this
thing
for
what
i
could
get
out
of
it
i
done
it
for
you
please
remember
that
when
you
counting
up
how
much
i
cost
you
on
this
trip
count
what
i
saved
you
too
by
jove
i
not
likely
to
forget
said
i
if
the
thing
had
ended
by
being
the
fiancé
it
does
bear
dwelling
on
but
i
want
you
to
have
the
ring
i
saw
all
yesterday
afternoon
and
evening
what
you
were
up
to
on
my
behalf
and
i
bought
the
ring
on
purpose
to
give
to
you
if
you
pulled
me
through
as
i
half
thought
you
would
it
was
born
and
bred
for
an
engagement
ring
she
said
give
it
to
the
girl
you
going
to
marry
i
have
asked
her
yet
you
mean
to
i
suppose
i
suppose
so
but
she
may
not
accept
me
do
you
think
she
will
if
i
have
an
opinion
i
not
going
to
tell
you
only
keep
your
ring
so
i
had
to
keep
it
and
all
day
while
again
we
passed
flowery
boskoop
not
so
flowery
now
quaint
gouda
and
the
other
little
towns
which
carried
me
back
in
mind
to
the
beginning
of
our
trip
i
wondered
and
puzzled
over
the
change
in
that
lady
of
mystery
the
xxxiii
we
slept
in
rotterdam
at
the
old
hotel
in
the
park
where
the
angels
were
staying
when
first
they
came
into
my
life
the
next
day
was
a
memorable
one
in
van
buren
annals
for
the
new
fiancée
was
to
be
received
as
such
into
the
bosom
of
the
family
robert
and
the
twins
had
left
us
on
our
arrival
in
rotterdam
for
the
town
house
is
still
closed
for
the
summer
and
the
residence
is
at
scheveningen
it
was
for
the
brother
and
sisters
to
pave
the
way
for
phyllis
and
solve
if
they
could
the
mystery
which
must
have
wrapped
the
unsigned
telegram
announcing
the
engagement
in
the
morning
before
any
of
us
had
had
breakfast
back
came
robert
in
one
of
brederode
automobiles
alb
seems
to
shed
and
along
the
path
of
life
as
most
people
shed
old
shoes
bringing
a
note
from
madame
at
the
villa
van
buren
what
it
said
i
shall
probably
never
know
but
robert
too
handsome
face
was
a
shade
less
tranquil
than
usual
and
i
guessed
that
as
nell
would
say
he
had
had
to
be
very
frisian
before
he
succeeded
in
persuading
his
still
more
frisian
mother
that
phyllis
rivers
is
a
desirable
substitute
for
freule
menela
van
der
windt
in
any
case
he
had
persuaded
her
he
would
be
the
viking
that
he
is
if
he
had
and
though
by
the
shadow
round
his
calm
gray
eyes
it
had
probably
taken
half
or
all
of
the
night
the
note
he
produced
must
have
been
satisfactory
for
phyllis
brightened
as
she
read
it
soon
after
the
visit
to
scheveningen
was
arranged
but
robert
had
no
doubt
prepared
the
girls
for
the
necessity
of
making
it
for
nell
and
phyllis
both
came
down
to
breakfast
in
their
prettiest
dresses
looking
irresistible
and
an
hour
later
with
over
their
hats
they
went
off
with
robert
in
the
automobile
they
were
to
spend
the
day
for
people
in
the
hollow
land
enjoy
their
pleasures
as
much
by
quantity
as
quality
especially
their
society
and
i
could
only
hope
that
a
certain
wistfulness
of
expression
as
she
looked
back
from
the
of
the
red
car
meant
that
nell
would
rather
have
remained
with
some
of
those
who
were
left
behind
if
she
had
stayed
in
rotterdam
and
relied
upon
me
for
entertainment
i
should
certainly
have
proposed
to
her
as
it
was
i
passed
the
day
somewhat
gloomily
reflecting
on
the
time
i
had
wasted
while
i
had
her
by
my
side
now
i
reminded
myself
the
trip
as
planned
was
drawing
to
a
close
there
remained
the
visit
to
zeeland
an
affair
of
a
few
days
after
that
what
getting
back
to
rotterdam
again
for
the
last
time
selling
the
boat
perhaps
at
least
nell
used
to
talk
of
that
in
the
first
days
when
the
end
seemed
and
vague
the
kept
to
her
on
the
plea
that
she
had
a
lot
of
writing
to
do
and
tibe
was
on
guard
as
for
the
albatross
he
went
off
without
excuse
to
seek
the
friends
of
his
past
with
which
the
mariner
has
no
connection
a
premonition
of
the
future
came
upon
me
i
remembered
the
prince
in
the
fairy
tale
who
was
given
by
the
fates
three
magic
citrons
and
told
that
each
one
contained
a
beautiful
sylph
who
would
appear
to
him
as
he
cut
the
rind
of
her
prison
she
would
ask
for
a
drink
of
water
and
if
he
wished
to
keep
her
for
his
wife
he
must
instantly
obey
or
she
would
vanish
never
to
return
even
in
response
to
the
most
fervent
prayer
when
the
prince
cut
the
first
citron
the
fairy
vision
which
flashed
before
his
eyes
was
so
dazzling
that
bewildered
he
let
her
go
with
the
second
the
same
thing
happened
and
it
was
only
by
the
greatest
effort
of
that
he
preserved
the
third
beauty
for
his
own
eventually
marrying
her
as
a
virtuous
prince
should
now
said
i
to
myself
i
not
as
well
off
as
that
prince
being
only
a
commoner
i
ought
to
consider
that
i
lucky
to
have
two
citrons
where
he
had
three
i
let
the
first
sylph
vanish
and
if
i
secure
the
second
i
need
never
hope
to
get
such
another
present
of
fairy
citrons
for
they
have
run
out
of
stock
the
thought
of
going
to
my
grave
bereft
of
phyllis
and
nell
citrons
all
through
my
own
folly
made
me
feel
elderly
at
and
perhaps
my
day
of
gloom
was
not
wasted
because
long
before
the
red
car
brought
back
the
girl
i
have
lost
and
the
girl
i
have
still
to
win
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
propose
to
miss
van
buren
before
i
should
be
hours
older
when
alb
appeared
it
seemed
that
he
had
been
among
his
aquatic
friends
tactfully
seeking
news
of
sir
alec
macnairne
and
wilhelmina
but
he
had
learned
nothing
and
we
had
to
console
each
other
by
saying
that
no
news
is
good
news
there
a
chance
of
course
of
running
across
him
again
in
zeeland
but
it
only
one
in
ten
for
there
are
other
places
where
he
is
more
likely
to
be
pursuing
us
since
he
lost
the
trail
in
leeuwarden
or
perhaps
he
has
given
up
the
idea
that
aunt
fay
is
on
rudolph
brederode
boat
and
has
gone
to
search
for
her
in
some
other
less
watery
country
in
any
case
the
trip
will
be
over
in
a
few
days
now
and
once
the
has
vanished
with
tibe
into
the
vast
obscurity
whence
she
emerged
in
answer
to
my
advertisement
poor
alec
may
pounce
upon
me
when
he
likes
if
i
can
persuade
nell
that
she
and
i
were
born
for
each
other
as
robert
seems
without
difficulty
to
have
persuaded
phyllis
in
his
regard
it
ought
to
be
easy
to
convince
her
that
a
sin
for
her
sake
is
no
sin
having
confessed
all
and
been
forgiven
i
can
defy
alec
to
do
his
worst
as
for
alb
he
has
had
his
fun
for
his
wages
and
there
are
many
beautiful
girls
in
holland
and
other
countries
who
ask
nothing
better
than
to
become
jonkheeresses
xxxiv
robert
came
on
board
with
us
as
a
matter
of
course
in
starting
for
zeeland
has
he
not
more
right
than
i
to
the
deck
of
mascotte
as
the
cousin
of
the
owner
and
the
fiancé
of
her
stepsister
he
and
phyllis
were
the
only
ones
among
us
who
had
the
same
air
of
cheerful
anticipation
at
setting
off
for
new
scenes
which
all
used
to
have
when
the
trip
was
but
a
few
days
old
for
them
there
is
no
thought
of
any
end
since
the
tour
of
life
together
is
just
beginning
full
petrol
ahead
even
when
she
was
lorelei
and
had
no
concealments
from
the
world
mascotte
never
sped
more
bravely
through
the
wide
noord
canal
she
took
us
as
unconcernedly
as
if
our
hopes
and
fears
for
the
future
were
nothing
to
her
out
of
sheer
spite
at
her
lack
of
sympathy
i
enjoyed
my
private
knowledge
that
whatever
happens
to
her
she
is
certain
to
lose
her
companion
waterspin
but
she
did
know
that
so
she
jogged
on
purring
in
blissful
ignorance
of
the
separation
in
store
for
her
if
dordrecht
had
come
under
our
eyes
when
they
were
fresh
to
dutch
waterways
we
could
not
have
passed
it
even
now
with
and
preoccupied
with
private
heartburnings
it
seemed
rather
like
passing
venice
without
troubling
to
stop
for
dordrecht
appeared
to
me
more
reminiscent
of
venice
than
any
other
place
seen
during
the
trip
so
attractive
did
it
look
as
we
peered
up
its
canals
that
i
did
suggest
pausing
it
would
give
us
one
more
day
together
i
said
if
we
took
this
for
exploring
dordrecht
and
arrived
at
middelburg
why
are
we
in
a
hurry
brederode
laughed
ask
robert
he
said
but
robert
face
and
phyllis
both
answered
before
the
question
could
be
put
i
guessed
that
robert
would
have
liked
to
stop
the
tour
at
rotterdam
for
what
to
him
are
the
joys
of
traveling
with
a
party
compared
to
the
bliss
of
the
honeymoon
but
that
phyllis
would
not
cheat
nell
of
zeeland
which
has
always
been
talked
of
as
the
climax
of
the
trip
zeeland
the
mysterious
zeeland
the
strange
proud
daughter
of
the
sea
some
time
we
shall
meet
again
for
you
must
all
join
in
paying
a
visit
to
phyllis
and
me
then
we
will
take
you
to
dordrecht
and
we
will
all
speak
together
of
this
day
said
robert
that
settled
it
for
though
nell
is
owner
of
the
boat
and
mistress
of
the
situation
she
would
do
nothing
to
postpone
phyllis
happiness
something
of
the
sort
she
murmured
to
me
as
we
puffed
past
dordrecht
but
i
could
see
by
her
face
that
phyllis
idea
of
happiness
is
not
hers
good
excuse
to
get
in
my
entering
wedge
i
thought
ask
her
if
she
does
think
it
a
risk
for
a
girl
to
marry
anybody
but
one
of
her
own
countrymen
if
she
says
there
my
chance
if
she
inclined
to
argue
try
to
convince
her
with
our
case
in
point
no
sooner
however
had
i
got
my
shoulder
closer
to
her
white
serge
shoulder
as
we
both
leaned
over
the
rail
looking
back
toward
the
old
town
founded
by
great
count
dietrich
than
up
sidled
the
lady
who
sometimes
her
duties
as
chaperon
she
wanted
to
know
about
dordrecht
and
john
of
brabant
and
the
siege
and
the
inundation
that
set
the
town
upon
an
island
nor
would
she
be
discouraged
when
i
told
her
flatly
that
i
knew
nothing
about
it
and
advised
application
to
baedeker
she
lingered
prattling
pleasantly
of
the
merevede
and
of
the
peace
and
watery
silence
into
which
we
had
passed
now
that
dordrecht
was
left
behind
she
drew
tibe
attention
to
the
gulls
and
our
attention
to
tibe
she
asked
if
we
did
not
smell
salt
and
insisted
on
our
sniffing
actively
to
make
sure
then
cried
i
told
you
so
when
after
slipping
under
a
huge
hanging
so
high
that
the
train
upon
it
looked
like
a
child
toy
we
turned
westward
and
floated
out
upon
a
wide
arm
of
the
sea
altogether
she
would
not
let
us
forget
her
presence
for
a
moment
and
blandly
refused
to
understand
when
my
raised
eyebrows
telegraphed
i
did
hire
you
for
this
we
seemed
now
to
have
said
to
the
sheltered
coziness
of
holland
just
as
we
had
said
to
several
other
pleasant
dreams
of
the
past
on
either
side
the
land
ran
away
from
us
and
hid
beneath
the
dancing
waves
which
ruffled
the
sea
sleeve
so
that
we
saw
of
it
only
long
stripes
of
green
which
were
great
dykes
and
irregular
frillings
of
red
which
were
steeples
and
tiled
roofs
of
houses
the
tide
was
in
our
favor
and
we
moved
so
quickly
that
alb
thought
we
would
have
no
difficulty
in
reaching
middelburg
by
nightfall
large
steamers
passed
us
their
decks
piled
with
cargo
passengers
crowding
to
the
side
to
stare
curiously
down
upon
us
as
we
rocked
coquettishly
in
their
save
for
these
big
floating
houses
and
broad
bowed
coughing
mascotte
and
waterspin
had
the
wide
waterway
to
themselves
and
when
we
had
taken
a
southerly
course
to
enter
a
channel
between
islands
we
were
in
zeeland
still
though
we
were
skirting
the
shore
of
the
island
of
schouwen
it
was
as
if
it
ducked
its
head
rather
than
submit
to
the
ignominy
of
being
seen
by
strangers
it
was
just
as
alb
said
zeeland
was
illusive
with
the
power
of
making
herself
invisible
the
endless
straight
lines
of
the
dykes
protecting
schouwen
and
tholen
from
the
terrible
power
of
the
sea
stretched
like
ranks
of
devoted
soldiers
each
stone
a
knight
in
armor
defending
their
liege
ladies
from
an
invading
giant
hiding
the
besieged
damsels
beauty
behind
their
shields
so
that
the
monster
appetite
might
not
be
whetted
by
their
charms
schouwen
on
the
one
hand
tholen
on
the
other
seemed
to
fall
apart
as
brederode
cast
us
upon
the
broad
bosom
of
the
oster
scheldt
steering
for
north
beveland
and
told
us
legends
the
while
of
that
strange
archipelago
which
has
for
its
arms
a
lion
swimming
in
deep
waters
he
told
of
the
siren
who
would
sing
to
lure
sailors
to
her
rock
because
she
was
bored
by
the
society
of
the
merman
her
husband
how
some
fisherman
one
night
caught
her
in
a
net
and
because
she
was
beautiful
would
not
give
her
back
to
the
merman
though
he
begged
and
prayed
offering
a
rich
bribe
of
pearls
and
coral
how
the
merman
swam
away
at
last
cursing
the
fishermen
and
their
country
vowing
never
to
rest
till
he
and
his
brothers
with
their
own
hands
had
brought
enough
sand
to
choke
all
the
city
ports
he
told
too
of
the
tempests
which
throw
on
the
shores
of
little
isles
the
bodies
of
strange
mummied
monsters
part
man
part
boat
and
of
still
clear
dawnings
when
the
fisherfolk
of
domburg
can
discern
far
down
under
the
green
water
pagan
temples
of
marble
and
gleaming
statues
more
perfect
than
any
fashioned
by
known
sculptors
even
the
greatest
masters
when
greek
art
was
in
its
prime
he
told
of
the
great
dyke
building
and
how
at
high
tide
the
north
sea
beats
fiercely
on
zeeland
locked
door
he
told
of
the
inundations
and
how
schouwen
north
and
south
beveland
tholen
and
walcheren
had
all
been
devoured
by
the
sea
only
to
rise
up
again
braver
and
stronger
than
before
he
told
how
the
men
of
zeeland
had
fought
against
the
men
of
spain
in
the
old
bad
days
and
it
was
all
very
interesting
and
instructive
but
how
was
i
to
oppose
my
frail
vow
against
such
a
tide
of
information
there
were
no
dykes
built
round
my
resolve
to
propose
to
nell
within
the
space
of
four
and
twenty
hours
and
between
eloquence
and
the
persistence
it
dissolved
like
a
dutch
town
in
an
inundation
still
i
was
not
as
furious
as
i
ought
to
have
been
my
steeples
and
chimneys
remained
above
water
and
the
sky
was
so
cloudless
that
i
could
not
despair
it
seemed
like
old
times
to
hear
alb
holding
forth
upon
the
history
drama
and
legend
of
the
little
country
of
which
he
is
so
proud
and
in
spite
of
myself
my
heart
was
warm
for
him
i
rather
wondered
how
nell
had
contrived
to
harden
hers
so
relentlessly
against
those
clear
brown
features
those
deep
brown
eyes
and
the
firm
mouth
which
is
not
cold
a
good
thing
for
me
thought
i
that
she
has
and
if
i
do
get
a
chance
to
ask
her
i
write
a
note
and
beg
the
no
get
sister
phyllis
to
give
it
to
her
this
evening
i
was
arranging
the
wording
of
the
note
after
tea
which
we
had
on
deck
when
quite
idly
at
first
my
eyes
dwelt
upon
a
black
speck
moving
far
away
in
our
wake
it
amused
me
to
see
the
speck
grow
for
at
the
moment
i
had
no
one
to
talk
to
and
tibe
was
asleep
with
his
chin
on
my
knee
i
lost
track
of
a
sentence
which
was
shaping
itself
nicely
in
my
mind
and
ought
to
have
been
irresistible
to
nell
in
wondering
what
the
speck
would
turn
out
to
be
it
was
growing
fast
which
meant
that
it
was
moving
fast
perhaps
faster
than
we
could
it
be
a
but
why
should
a
be
forging
out
to
sea
where
no
or
of
any
sort
except
racers
had
any
need
to
venture
unless
they
were
navigated
to
gratify
the
whim
of
a
wilful
american
girl
now
it
did
not
appear
likely
that
in
dutch
waters
there
could
be
at
this
moment
an
indefinite
number
of
american
girls
wilful
or
otherwise
owning
and
wishing
to
visit
zeeland
in
them
if
it
were
not
such
a
fine
day
alb
would
not
have
taken
the
risk
with
mascotte
and
waterspin
even
to
please
his
particular
american
girl
and
if
it
were
not
to
please
her
he
would
probably
not
have
come
in
any
case
yet
that
thing
behind
us
was
skimming
along
too
fast
to
be
anything
else
save
a
what
then
was
its
errand
in
this
wide
expanse
of
water
which
did
not
lend
itself
to
the
encouragement
of
promiscuous
it
was
gaining
on
us
now
for
it
had
no
fat
waterspin
to
drag
one
might
almost
think
it
was
following
it
came
so
straight
and
suddenly
my
ears
and
the
top
of
my
head
felt
hot
i
got
up
and
went
to
alb
who
was
standing
silent
at
the
wheel
before
i
spoke
to
him
i
glanced
at
the
others
to
see
that
they
were
all
fully
occupied
in
listening
to
robert
talk
of
the
house
next
door
to
his
mother
in
rotterdam
which
he
had
the
intention
of
buying
as
a
wedding
present
for
phyllis
alb
said
i
just
throw
a
look
over
your
shoulder
and
say
what
manner
of
thing
you
think
that
is
coming
after
us
he
threw
the
look
i
think
he
answered
slowly
that
it
by
way
of
being
sir
alec
macnairne
good
heavens
i
exclaimed
you
take
it
pretty
calmly
but
even
as
i
reproached
him
i
was
conscious
of
an
increase
of
speed
alb
can
regulate
this
by
means
of
a
long
lever
which
goes
down
through
the
deck
to
the
motor
what
makes
you
think
it
sir
alec
i
asked
you
ca
tell
yet
what
the
thing
looks
like
neither
can
you
said
alb
you
what
it
was
it
the
same
with
me
i
feel
it
and
i
going
to
try
and
give
her
the
slip
again
if
i
can
but
honestly
if
it
she
and
she
wants
to
overhaul
us
we
have
got
much
chance
weighted
down
by
if
it
were
for
that
i
guarantee
to
let
see
nothing
but
our
heels
let
cut
adrift
i
whispered
glaring
at
poor
toon
who
stood
steering
the
squat
little
barge
with
an
irritatingly
complacent
look
on
his
nice
face
impossible
my
dear
fellow
but
you
do
mean
it
of
course
i
capable
of
meaning
anything
said
i
see
here
old
alb
pulled
me
through
a
lot
of
things
since
you
tied
yourself
round
my
neck
pull
me
through
this
and
you
shall
be
best
man
at
my
wedding
who
be
the
bride
he
asked
as
i
stared
back
at
the
following
craft
which
was
now
too
big
to
be
called
a
speck
it
was
a
black
blot
upon
the
water
as
upon
my
hopes
the
bride
i
repeated
why
n
oh
by
jove
was
she
the
one
wanted
at
one
time
you
never
would
tell
which
you
know
so
you
blame
me
are
you
engaged
to
her
he
asked
in
rather
a
queer
voice
and
i
realized
how
much
i
was
at
his
mercy
as
fascinated
i
watched
his
brown
hand
tighten
on
the
wheel
if
he
liked
he
could
stop
mascotte
in
mid
sea
and
let
me
lie
at
the
mercy
of
the
enemy
could
do
nothing
hendrik
would
obey
him
not
me
even
tibe
would
not
seize
him
by
the
throat
to
please
me
tibe
likes
and
respects
alb
even
more
strange
to
say
than
he
does
me
but
to
do
alb
justice
he
was
not
slowing
down
on
the
contrary
he
was
putting
on
speed
as
much
i
feared
as
mascotte
was
capable
of
making
i
not
engaged
i
admitted
but
i
was
going
to
propose
to
her
if
this
had
happened
for
goodness
sake
hurry
i
wonder
you
have
the
cheek
to
tell
me
that
and
then
ask
me
to
hurry
why
should
i
help
you
to
get
her
do
you
still
want
her
i
asked
more
than
i
ever
wanted
or
shall
want
anything
else
then
it
all
up
with
me
i
groaned
do
you
mean
i
only
mean
that
you
can
make
me
lose
her
if
alec
macnairne
boards
us
like
a
pirate
and
yells
for
his
fay
i
shall
be
discovered
as
a
perjured
villain
just
in
the
very
hour
when
it
necessary
for
me
to
appear
most
virtuous
heavens
if
this
could
only
have
happened
once
i
was
sure
of
her
i
have
confessed
everything
for
i
could
have
made
her
understand
how
it
was
all
done
for
her
sake
for
love
of
her
and
her
stepsister
said
alb
bitterly
as
he
did
to
the
wheel
what
perhaps
he
would
have
liked
to
do
to
my
throat
that
was
a
mere
boyish
fancy
said
i
i
love
nell
van
buren
with
a
man
love
you
can
stop
this
boat
if
you
choose
to
be
a
revengeful
albatross
i
shall
not
stop
the
boat
he
said
in
a
grave
hard
voice
which
made
my
tone
sound
light
almost
humorous
i
shall
not
rob
you
of
your
chance
with
her
if
it
depends
upon
me
you
shall
have
it
i
really
did
admire
alb
as
he
stood
there
not
looking
at
me
but
straight
ahead
as
if
into
a
blank
future
do
you
care
for
her
a
lot
i
asked
half
remorsefully
only
more
than
for
the
rest
of
the
world
put
together
but
i
tell
you
honestly
i
have
had
much
hope
lately
i
suppose
i
was
a
conceited
ass
to
make
up
my
mind
that
nothing
should
stop
me
from
winning
the
girl
in
spite
of
herself
well
she
punished
me
shown
me
my
folly
but
for
all
that
i
regret
nothing
if
it
were
to
do
over
again
come
on
board
this
boat
and
work
for
her
as
i
have
worked
even
knowing
as
i
know
now
that
she
end
by
disliking
me
as
much
as
she
did
in
the
beginning
you
an
attractive
fellow
to
women
starr
phyllis
preferred
robert
i
said
thoughtfully
yes
i
confess
i
hoped
you
and
miss
rivers
would
make
a
match
then
have
had
nothing
to
fear
from
you
in
the
other
direction
but
it
to
be
and
she
and
bob
van
buren
will
be
perfectly
happy
you
fear
i
turn
against
you
depend
on
me
to
do
my
best
with
the
boat
though
of
course
you
wo
expect
help
in
any
other
way
of
course
not
i
said
nor
need
it
i
suppose
he
added
harshly
perhaps
we
may
be
mistaken
about
the
boat
being
alec
i
said
we
both
know
we
not
said
he
still
there
my
glass
have
a
squint
through
it
i
took
up
the
binocular
which
the
skipper
always
keeps
handy
and
had
the
squint
as
he
recommended
it
was
not
an
encouraging
squint
for
though
our
follower
had
not
been
gaining
for
the
last
few
minutes
all
i
could
see
of
her
made
me
more
confident
than
before
that
she
was
wilhelmina
whether
alec
macnairne
was
actually
in
chase
of
us
or
whether
it
merely
happened
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
try
zeeland
in
his
quest
remained
to
be
seen
but
be
that
as
it
might
we
were
in
the
greatest
danger
of
being
overtaken
in
my
agitation
and
fear
of
losing
all
i
could
not
concentrate
my
mind
upon
the
thinking
out
of
any
stratagem
to
outwit
alec
if
he
came
upon
us
and
i
dared
not
interrupt
alb
task
by
imploring
him
to
rack
his
brains
the
thing
for
him
to
do
i
told
myself
was
to
keep
ahead
of
wilhelmina
at
any
price
especially
while
we
were
in
open
water
once
we
could
gain
the
region
of
canals
and
narrow
cross
channels
we
might
slip
round
a
and
disappear
anything
anything
then
to
keep
ahead
run
down
and
tell
hendrik
to
see
that
there
plenty
of
water
said
alb
it
wo
do
for
the
motor
to
get
hot
say
to
him
that
we
going
to
have
a
race
i
ca
make
him
understand
i
wailed
i
forgot
well
take
the
wheel
a
minute
then
i
dare
if
i
do
something
sure
to
go
wrong
or
i
shall
snap
it
short
off
on
its
stem
you
are
a
helpless
chap
i
must
say
so
would
you
be
if
i
told
you
to
finish
one
of
my
pictures
perhaps
that
true
well
say
this
and
he
uttered
words
in
dutch
which
i
repeated
after
him
until
i
knew
them
by
heart
then
i
went
below
and
gabbled
them
to
hendrik
not
more
than
half
wrong
for
he
seemed
to
understand
but
while
the
pink
youth
abandoned
the
operation
of
rubbing
brass
with
cotton
waste
in
favor
of
bailing
up
water
i
stood
gazing
at
the
motor
praying
it
to
do
its
best
it
was
hot
in
the
motor
den
so
hot
that
it
was
no
wonder
the
deck
which
formed
the
roof
often
felt
warm
underfoot
chump
chump
went
the
engine
sounding
stolid
and
dutch
and
obstinate
as
if
nothing
on
earth
or
water
could
induce
it
to
go
faster
than
it
chose
it
even
seemed
to
me
as
i
gazed
that
it
was
slowing
down
out
of
spite
i
longed
to
feel
its
pulses
with
a
in
the
other
hand
and
make
sure
could
it
be
that
after
all
alb
had
changed
his
mind
and
meant
to
betray
me
no
it
must
be
a
trick
of
my
amateurish
fancy
i
assured
myself
of
this
two
or
three
times
over
but
when
hendrik
came
back
with
a
big
pail
of
water
i
saw
by
his
face
that
i
had
not
been
deceived
something
was
wrong
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
question
him
since
i
have
no
dutch
and
he
has
no
english
except
thank
you
and
good
day
he
flew
at
the
motor
his
cheeks
pinker
than
ever
and
i
flew
up
on
deck
to
find
alb
in
the
act
of
giving
over
the
wheel
to
nell
he
pushed
past
me
with
a
quick
do
stop
me
i
got
to
see
wrong
and
i
joined
nell
who
looked
very
proud
of
herself
as
skipper
every
one
on
deck
was
alert
now
knowing
that
something
had
happened
for
the
first
time
in
all
our
peaceful
watery
weeks
they
were
not
yet
aware
of
the
pirate
in
pursuit
or
that
this
day
was
the
one
of
all
others
when
the
motor
ought
not
to
fail
us
but
they
knew
that
after
putting
on
a
fine
spurt
of
speed
for
some
reason
or
other
the
engine
had
turned
suddenly
sulky
and
was
threatening
to
stop
have
i
the
evil
eye
i
asked
myself
did
i
the
beastly
thing
when
i
went
below
and
stared
at
it
what
the
matter
i
inquired
of
nell
feeling
a
certain
relief
in
talking
to
her
she
looked
so
beautiful
and
so
dependable
do
speak
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
she
said
smiling
but
keeping
her
eyes
straight
ahead
jonkheer
brederode
says
it
nothing
serious
we
are
to
worry
remarked
the
from
her
i
think
it
rather
fun
to
have
a
nice
little
accident
it
breaks
the
monotony
and
it
really
exciting
being
out
at
sea
it
rather
exciting
said
i
signaling
danger
with
a
glance
that
swept
the
water
as
far
back
as
the
now
plainly
visible
pursuer
she
may
or
may
not
have
caught
my
meaning
but
robert
van
buren
eyes
chanced
at
that
instant
to
fall
upon
the
distant
craft
ah
he
observed
in
a
tone
of
careless
interest
for
which
i
could
have
boxed
his
ears
there
is
another
i
believe
it
is
coming
as
straight
as
if
it
were
following
us
i
saw
the
give
a
start
she
looked
at
me
and
our
eyes
would
have
met
had
it
not
been
for
the
blue
glasses
she
understood
and
knew
just
exciting
her
nice
little
accident
might
turn
out
to
be
at
this
moment
the
motor
gave
a
groan
and
stopped
as
its
heart
ceased
to
beat
i
was
astounded
by
the
apparition
of
a
totally
new
alb
two
minutes
ago
at
most
he
had
disappeared
in
the
garb
of
a
gentleman
with
a
yachting
turn
of
mind
he
reappeared
in
a
suit
of
hendrik
blue
overalls
and
apparently
nothing
else
his
feet
being
bare
in
his
hand
were
a
hammer
and
a
chisel
motor
all
right
it
must
be
the
propeller
that
wrong
i
going
down
to
see
he
explained
no
trace
of
excitement
on
his
face
no
hint
of
flurry
in
his
voice
alb
is
a
good
plucked
one
and
for
presence
of
mind
and
i
never
met
his
equal
as
mascotte
had
slowed
down
and
then
stopped
waterspin
came
lolloping
alongside
toon
looking
scarcely
more
flustered
than
his
superior
kept
the
barge
from
bunting
into
her
consort
fending
her
off
with
a
pole
alb
with
a
rope
round
his
waist
to
keep
him
steady
at
his
work
under
the
water
slid
over
the
side
of
the
boat
and
groped
about
with
his
free
hand
under
the
there
something
round
the
screw
shaft
he
called
up
to
robert
and
me
queer
thing
it
feels
like
a
coil
of
wire
we
must
have
picked
it
up
in
the
canal
by
dordrecht
and
ever
since
it
been
slowly
winding
itself
round
the
shaft
until
now
it
so
tight
that
the
propeller
work
then
all
hope
over
i
said
with
a
meaning
which
he
alone
or
perhaps
the
could
understand
we
caught
in
a
trap
this
hammer
and
chisel
will
gnaw
our
way
out
he
answered
the
game
is
up
yet
i
got
to
work
in
davy
jones
workshop
drawing
a
deep
breath
he
dropped
down
under
water
which
hid
him
from
sight
like
a
roof
of
thick
gray
glass
then
in
a
few
seconds
we
heard
a
knocking
muffled
mysterious
somewhere
below
that
glass
roof
after
a
time
which
seemed
long
to
every
one
and
an
age
to
me
up
came
alb
head
wet
black
and
glittering
wish
i
had
a
diver
helmet
he
said
when
he
had
breathed
and
promptly
dipped
out
of
sight
again
once
more
the
knocking
came
alb
was
working
hard
and
loyally
for
my
interests
and
against
his
own
i
could
help
remembering
but
meanwhile
we
were
floating
idly
losing
precious
time
while
the
pirate
gained
upon
us
fifteen
minutes
more
of
this
inaction
and
he
would
be
on
our
backs
i
almost
wished
that
he
were
a
true
pirate
and
that
it
might
be
a
war
of
knives
and
cutlasses
instead
of
wits
and
tongues
i
could
be
brave
enough
then
but
as
a
fraudulent
nephew
detected
with
his
false
aunt
so
to
speak
in
his
mouth
what
wonder
if
i
felt
my
heart
turn
to
water
twice
more
alb
came
up
to
breathe
and
dived
again
the
last
time
all
was
still
underneath
the
water
and
a
fear
came
over
me
that
alb
had
knocked
his
head
against
something
or
got
a
cramp
but
he
appeared
spluttering
and
announced
that
he
had
been
cutting
the
wire
through
with
the
chisel
there
it
was
in
his
hand
a
thick
ugly
coil
dangerous
as
an
octopus
start
the
motor
hendrik
he
called
even
before
he
had
clambered
on
deck
now
ladies
unless
you
go
below
you
may
get
a
shower
bath
for
we
going
to
have
a
race
with
the
that
coming
along
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
you
know
and
i
ca
trust
the
wheel
to
any
one
while
i
run
down
and
change
we
sha
mind
a
wetting
said
nell
whose
eyes
were
shining
with
something
very
like
admiration
we
want
to
see
the
race
i
would
rather
you
saw
it
from
the
cabin
windows
said
brederode
and
i
guessed
at
once
that
he
had
more
than
one
object
in
hustling
the
women
of
the
party
below
the
guessed
also
and
headed
a
reluctant
procession
now
the
pursuing
vengeance
was
not
five
hundred
yards
behind
and
if
we
had
ever
doubted
that
she
was
wilhelmina
we
doubted
no
longer
i
could
distinctly
see
a
man
figure
in
the
bow
and
would
have
felt
safe
in
staking
any
sum
that
it
was
sir
alec
alb
dripping
like
a
stood
at
the
wheel
and
as
i
had
never
seen
him
look
more
attractive
perhaps
it
was
as
well
for
me
that
nell
had
gone
below
they
think
me
a
madman
when
we
come
to
a
lock
said
he
but
who
cares
i
bound
to
get
you
out
of
this
scrape
if
i
can
never
was
sound
more
melodious
in
my
ears
than
the
quickening
throb
of
the
motor
i
felt
intimate
and
at
home
with
it
as
with
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
on
we
went
pounding
along
at
recovered
speed
and
were
well
into
the
channel
between
north
and
south
beveland
but
there
also
was
wilhelmina
oh
for
some
small
side
canal
into
which
we
could
slip
and
somehow
disappear
as
my
eyes
searched
the
waste
of
green
water
and
the
low
coasts
of
beveland
all
unexpectedly
to
me
we
rounded
a
point
and
there
was
a
town
one
graceful
spire
seeming
to
beckon
where
safety
lay
it
veere
said
alb
you
sure
to
have
heard
of
it
all
artists
have
but
the
thing
of
importance
to
us
now
is
the
canal
which
begins
here
crosses
the
island
of
walcheren
and
goes
to
middelburg
and
vlissingen
if
only
we
can
get
in
and
shut
out
can
we
i
gasped
look
he
answered
what
luck
i
looked
and
saw
from
afar
two
great
of
a
monster
lock
standing
open
while
into
its
jaws
poured
a
train
of
barges
and
small
steamers
which
had
been
biding
their
time
outside
joy
i
cried
we
saved
not
yet
said
alb
as
we
dashed
on
full
speed
ahead
going
as
we
had
never
gone
yet
we
may
be
too
late
quick
run
haul
down
the
stars
and
stripes
and
hoist
the
club
flag
instead
that
carry
more
power
even
than
the
whole
navy
of
the
united
states
and
i
mean
to
use
it
for
all
it
worth
right
or
no
right
i
darted
to
the
bow
and
changed
the
flags
fumbling
in
my
haste
then
when
the
talisman
was
floating
bravely
i
hurried
back
to
alb
who
was
imperiously
clanging
our
bell
with
one
hand
and
steering
with
the
other
i
stood
ready
with
the
long
not
daring
to
look
back
and
see
what
speed
wilhelmina
might
be
making
toon
was
alert
on
waterspin
with
a
coiled
rope
in
his
hand
all
the
boats
were
in
the
lock
now
and
the
sound
of
our
bell
and
the
colors
of
the
club
flag
alone
kept
the
from
closing
the
great
time
was
up
we
must
make
a
spurt
for
it
if
we
were
not
to
exhaust
his
patience
we
could
see
him
beckoning
eagerly
and
with
a
rush
we
were
at
the
gates
in
the
tail
of
the
long
procession
it
was
only
as
i
knew
they
were
slowly
inexorably
closing
behind
us
that
i
could
bring
myself
to
look
back
there
was
wilhelmina
just
coming
into
sight
round
the
point
alec
macnairne
gesticulating
wildly
a
figurehead
come
alive
and
furious
xxxv
great
scott
but
that
was
a
narrow
shave
i
sighed
in
ecstasy
out
of
it
now
he
may
be
out
of
the
lock
but
we
not
out
of
the
wood
said
alb
he
had
slowed
down
reversed
the
engine
and
quietly
passed
into
a
between
some
huge
barges
looking
not
a
whit
disconcerted
by
the
curious
gaze
of
the
who
wondered
at
his
bare
feet
and
soaked
overalls
why
what
can
he
do
i
asked
he
have
to
wait
an
hour
before
the
lock
opens
again
you
see
presently
what
he
can
do
said
alb
at
least
you
will
if
he
has
any
sense
it
will
be
time
for
us
to
crow
if
ever
i
burned
to
ask
what
he
meant
by
these
ominous
prognostications
but
he
began
to
jabber
in
dutch
to
our
staring
any
stranger
would
have
thought
him
in
the
pleasantest
mood
in
the
world
he
had
a
friendly
nod
for
the
skipper
of
a
smoking
tug
a
few
words
for
another
and
smiles
for
every
one
i
telling
them
that
i
a
wager
on
and
begging
their
kind
help
to
win
it
he
explained
to
me
as
gradually
he
pushed
mascotte
and
waterspin
through
and
ahead
of
the
other
craft
i
saying
nothing
about
the
club
flag
but
they
can
see
it
and
they
all
know
what
it
means
but
to
save
rows
i
being
extra
polite
and
you
see
it
pays
nobody
yet
has
resented
our
getting
ahead
though
theirs
is
the
right
of
precedence
on
we
went
toward
the
top
of
the
lock
sneaking
sidling
pushing
here
and
there
thanks
to
a
helping
hand
here
and
there
thanks
to
a
shout
from
the
to
a
sulky
bargeman
on
the
the
sight
of
the
club
flag
had
a
magic
effect
and
he
evidently
intended
to
make
its
rights
respected
no
doubt
counting
on
a
five
gulden
tip
at
the
end
ignorant
of
the
perils
at
which
alb
had
hinted
the
time
seemed
intolerably
long
as
the
water
foamed
in
through
the
upper
filling
the
lock
inch
by
inch
and
lifting
its
load
of
creaking
boats
and
tugs
when
we
entered
the
lower
gates
we
could
see
only
the
green
and
slimy
wall
of
the
lock
but
we
found
ourselves
looking
over
green
fields
to
a
picturesque
old
town
no
more
than
a
stone
throw
away
alb
pleasantries
and
the
might
of
the
club
flag
had
brought
us
near
to
the
top
of
the
lock
and
i
had
begun
to
hope
that
his
dark
prophecies
were
not
to
be
fulfilled
when
i
jumped
at
the
sound
of
a
shout
from
shore
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
alec
macnairne
and
turning
my
head
with
a
start
i
saw
his
tall
figure
tearing
toward
us
on
the
narrow
parapet
made
by
the
edge
of
the
lock
that
what
you
meant
i
quavered
that
what
i
meant
answered
alb
but
his
hand
was
on
the
starting
lever
and
the
upper
gates
had
begun
to
swing
back
alb
was
looking
particularly
debonair
and
taking
pattern
by
him
i
turned
away
from
my
aunt
husband
pretending
that
i
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
him
hi
you
there
starr
brederode
scoundrels
he
roared
at
our
backs
if
he
jumps
into
one
of
these
boats
and
gets
across
to
us
i
murmured
he
will
if
he
can
but
before
alb
could
finish
his
sentence
the
first
half
of
my
fear
was
verified
sir
alec
gathered
himself
for
a
spring
and
leaping
across
the
narrow
between
his
parapet
and
the
nearest
barge
landed
with
a
crash
on
the
gunwale
at
that
sound
my
heart
seemed
to
stop
for
repairs
for
there
were
two
barges
in
front
of
us
the
biggest
in
the
lock
and
we
had
not
been
able
to
pass
them
before
the
doors
began
to
open
now
we
could
not
escape
until
they
had
floated
out
into
the
canal
and
meanwhile
there
might
be
a
little
private
tragedy
in
high
life
on
board
mascotte
but
a
dutchman
lighter
is
as
sacred
alb
has
explained
to
us
all
as
a
dutchman
house
and
when
the
loud
explosive
scotsman
arrived
on
the
gunwale
uninvited
and
breathing
fire
the
lighter
owner
proceeded
also
to
breathe
fire
he
swore
his
kees
dog
yapped
his
children
cried
and
his
wife
vituperated
an
understudy
took
the
helm
and
before
sir
alec
could
jump
across
to
another
barge
in
his
pursuit
of
us
he
found
himself
engaged
in
an
encounter
with
the
skipper
of
his
first
choice
the
one
could
speak
no
english
the
other
could
speak
no
dutch
and
in
his
fury
at
seeing
us
slip
out
through
the
gates
behind
the
two
great
barges
he
could
do
nothing
but
stammer
with
rage
and
try
to
push
past
the
stout
form
which
strove
to
detain
him
for
argument
naturally
the
push
made
matters
worse
sir
alec
does
not
know
dutchmen
especially
lightermen
as
well
as
i
have
learned
to
do
or
he
would
have
refrained
from
that
extreme
and
on
the
man
own
barge
his
push
was
given
back
with
interest
and
the
last
we
saw
of
him
as
other
boats
surged
round
the
scene
of
the
contest
was
in
a
gallant
attempt
to
make
a
jump
while
a
stout
dutch
skipper
and
a
stout
dutch
skipper
stout
dutch
wife
held
on
to
his
again
i
drew
a
full
breath
of
relief
and
i
saw
by
alb
face
that
he
too
hoped
for
the
best
for
whatever
his
private
feelings
might
be
he
is
too
good
a
sportsman
not
to
feel
the
spirit
of
a
race
we
were
out
of
the
lock
our
propeller
churning
the
water
but
again
there
was
a
but
alb
made
a
dash
for
freedom
by
trying
to
glide
between
the
two
immense
barges
which
alone
of
all
the
late
denizens
of
the
lock
had
refused
to
give
us
precedence
but
his
gracious
ways
had
not
softened
the
hearts
of
these
skippers
nor
did
they
care
for
his
club
flag
all
they
did
care
for
was
to
keep
one
another
from
getting
ahead
evidently
they
were
old
enemies
and
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
they
had
engaged
in
deadly
duel
ancient
scores
had
to
be
paid
and
a
fig
for
those
who
came
after
each
glared
at
the
other
each
tried
to
push
his
big
craft
ahead
crash
they
stuck
and
jammed
the
man
at
the
right
the
man
at
the
left
pushing
with
all
his
force
with
a
giant
pole
each
push
locking
both
barges
the
tighter
we
were
on
their
heels
and
on
ours
was
the
whole
press
of
boats
let
out
from
the
lock
surging
heavily
forward
alb
shouted
something
in
dutch
i
saying
that
the
only
thing
is
for
one
to
give
way
and
let
the
other
go
by
in
advance
not
both
try
to
strain
through
together
he
explained
when
i
anxiously
demanded
to
know
what
was
happening
both
men
shook
their
heads
and
grumbled
while
from
behind
rose
a
babel
of
cries
and
adjurations
they
wo
said
alb
they
say
that
they
will
never
give
way
to
each
other
they
would
smash
their
boats
first
if
anything
happens
to
part
them
they
wo
mind
because
it
will
be
fate
and
neither
one
will
have
given
up
for
the
other
meanwhile
they
say
they
sorry
but
they
wo
move
and
the
rest
of
us
must
fare
the
best
we
can
ca
the
do
anything
i
asked
he
can
swear
alb
smiled
and
i
believe
there
was
something
in
him
that
sympathized
with
the
two
obstinate
brutes
for
goodness
sake
tell
them
we
give
each
one
a
hundred
no
a
thousand
gulden
if
necessary
if
only
they
agree
as
to
which
is
to
yield
and
move
out
of
our
road
i
tell
them
said
brederode
dubiously
and
a
few
words
passed
between
the
three
i
knew
what
they
answer
he
announced
in
a
moment
they
say
they
wo
do
it
for
a
million
man
has
his
price
is
a
proverb
that
does
count
with
dutchmen
where
principles
are
concerned
now
going
to
try
and
force
a
way
but
i
afraid
has
force
enough
and
if
not
it
all
up
for
here
comes
macnairne
i
looked
back
and
saw
my
picking
his
way
toward
us
from
boat
to
barge
from
barge
to
lighter
he
had
lost
his
hat
in
that
argument
of
which
i
had
not
seen
the
end
but
he
had
not
lost
his
determination
and
at
his
present
rate
he
would
reach
us
in
about
two
minutes
illustration
his
present
rate
he
would
reach
us
in
about
two
suddenly
alb
put
on
full
speed
ahead
and
gallantly
little
mascotte
rammed
her
dainty
nose
between
the
two
black
and
bulky
barges
but
her
strength
did
not
match
her
courage
she
got
only
a
pinching
for
her
pains
and
as
alb
exclaimed
we
were
caught
i
sorry
he
said
i
done
all
i
could
and
do
see
what
i
can
do
more
short
of
knocking
poor
macnairne
on
the
head
with
a
pole
you
been
a
brick
and
i
wo
forget
it
said
i
a
strange
coolness
had
come
upon
me
with
the
knowledge
that
the
worst
was
inevitable
i
felt
that
my
alone
could
win
me
through
all
i
ask
is
that
whatever
i
do
or
say
you
stand
by
me
i
finished
have
you
a
plan
he
asked
part
of
a
plan
i
before
i
had
a
chance
to
finish
either
plan
or
sentence
the
enemy
was
upon
us
i
heard
him
coming
and
turned
round
just
in
time
to
meet
my
aunt
husband
face
to
face
as
climbing
across
from
the
nearest
barge
he
leaped
over
the
rail
on
to
our
little
deck
xxxvi
i
smiled
brilliantly
at
the
dear
fellow
i
sprang
to
him
holding
out
a
welcoming
hand
why
sir
alec
this
a
delightful
surprise
i
exclaimed
where
you
come
from
i
thought
i
had
lost
you
at
leeuwarden
so
utterly
was
he
dumfounded
not
to
say
flabbergasted
by
the
manner
of
his
reception
that
i
had
time
to
spring
these
three
quickly
following
remarks
upon
him
before
he
was
able
to
answer
when
he
did
it
was
with
a
well
i
d
d
said
he
i
stared
in
gentle
amazement
then
glancing
quickly
at
alb
appeared
suddenly
to
apprehend
his
meaning
why
of
course
you
must
be
surprised
to
find
me
on
a
boat
with
jonkheer
brederode
you
lied
to
me
at
leeuwarden
went
on
sir
alec
he
was
never
a
man
to
mince
words
as
i
noticed
when
visiting
my
aunt
poor
pretty
flirtatious
aunt
fay
i
now
gathered
dignity
my
simple
delight
at
an
unexpected
meeting
with
a
relative
in
law
in
a
foreign
waterway
froze
into
virtuous
indignation
really
sir
alec
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
you
i
said
i
greet
you
in
the
most
friendly
because
you
a
scoundrel
and
a
hypocrite
said
he
this
interruption
i
scorned
to
notice
save
by
proceeding
as
i
had
intended
to
proceed
and
you
insult
me
what
do
you
mean
sir
alec
macnairne
i
mean
he
caught
me
up
without
hesitation
that
you
though
you
pretended
to
sympathize
when
i
confided
in
you
were
in
league
with
rudolph
brederode
to
outwit
and
deceive
me
in
the
most
shameless
way
you
forget
yourself
said
brederode
turning
red
and
contriving
to
keep
his
dignity
in
spite
of
hendrik
sopping
overalls
i
have
never
deceived
or
injured
you
if
this
were
my
boat
i
should
have
to
ask
do
try
that
on
said
sir
alec
scornfully
it
your
boat
it
happens
to
be
the
property
of
miss
van
buren
a
young
american
lady
for
whom
i
acting
as
skipper
returned
alb
rot
was
the
terse
comment
of
my
alb
bit
his
lip
and
his
eyes
were
growing
dangerous
i
had
seen
that
look
on
his
face
once
or
twice
and
he
engaged
to
her
said
i
that
is
something
inside
of
me
popped
out
those
words
and
there
they
were
spoken
not
to
be
taken
back
alb
and
i
looked
at
each
other
he
flushed
again
but
he
did
not
speak
produce
this
miss
van
buren
sneered
sir
alec
i
will
i
promised
but
before
i
do
calm
yourself
you
are
in
no
fit
state
to
speak
to
ladies
i
wish
to
talk
to
my
wife
said
he
aunt
fay
is
not
on
board
this
boat
and
never
has
been
i
pronounced
each
nerve
on
edge
lest
one
lovely
feminine
head
or
another
should
pop
up
from
below
i
knew
well
that
we
owed
the
extraordinary
obedience
of
the
girls
to
the
magnetic
influence
of
that
remarkable
woman
their
chaperon
and
how
long
she
could
continue
to
exert
the
charm
which
meshed
them
in
the
cabin
as
vivien
meshed
merlin
in
the
hollow
oak
it
was
impossible
to
guess
at
any
instant
we
might
hear
a
girlish
voice
calling
the
name
of
lady
macnairne
even
if
tibe
but
i
dared
not
think
of
tibe
horatius
holding
his
bridge
alone
was
nothing
compared
to
me
no
one
could
help
me
now
pooh
do
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
after
what
happened
at
leeuwarden
when
i
trusted
you
you
trusted
me
said
i
coldly
with
good
reason
and
it
would
be
well
if
you
did
so
again
kindly
state
what
from
your
point
of
view
happen
at
leeuwarden
to
bring
this
storm
of
unmerited
abuse
upon
my
head
i
dare
say
it
would
be
convenient
to
you
to
forget
i
met
you
with
brederode
at
the
kermess
you
seized
me
and
prevented
me
from
following
him
as
i
wished
to
do
then
when
he
had
got
out
of
my
way
you
assured
me
that
you
find
him
you
said
you
were
not
with
him
on
his
boat
that
you
had
been
together
ten
minutes
neither
had
we
said
i
that
was
perfectly
true
and
i
not
on
his
boat
as
he
told
you
i
on
miss
van
buren
and
if
i
did
look
you
up
to
tell
you
where
you
could
find
jonkheer
brederode
it
was
because
i
thought
you
would
only
lose
your
dignity
by
meeting
him
and
do
aunt
fay
and
yourself
both
more
harm
than
good
i
know
for
a
certainty
that
alb
that
brederode
has
seen
aunt
fay
since
july
anyhow
and
why
should
i
let
you
and
your
stupid
suspicions
make
trouble
between
a
very
good
fellow
and
and
the
girl
he
in
love
with
this
time
i
did
not
meet
alb
eyes
i
was
looking
straight
and
with
a
noble
defiance
into
sir
alec
you
are
very
high
and
mighty
said
he
but
i
not
to
be
fooled
again
by
either
of
you
i
been
chasing
brederode
for
weeks
in
that
beastly
and
i
about
sick
of
the
whole
business
i
got
him
now
and
you
too
and
though
you
may
both
tell
me
till
you
blue
in
the
face
that
my
wife
has
been
and
is
on
this
boat
i
believe
you
till
i
searched
every
hole
and
corner
of
it
perhaps
i
had
better
go
and
ask
miss
van
buren
whether
she
will
kindly
permit
my
to
make
such
an
examination
of
her
property
i
said
with
the
ice
of
conscious
rectitude
in
my
voice
very
well
returned
sir
alec
go
and
fetch
her
with
head
aloft
i
stalked
to
the
top
of
the
steps
which
i
defy
any
human
being
to
descend
with
dignity
what
would
happen
between
sir
alec
and
alb
while
i
was
gone
or
what
i
should
say
when
i
got
below
i
knew
not
i
could
only
trust
to
luck
was
it
going
to
turn
out
in
vain
i
asked
myself
that
all
my
life
i
have
been
called
lucky
starr
the
canvas
curtain
at
the
door
of
the
outer
cabin
which
protects
the
ladies
from
the
heat
of
the
was
unfurled
and
hanging
at
length
standing
behind
it
i
spoke
miss
van
buren
name
all
was
silent
on
the
other
side
but
after
a
delay
of
a
few
seconds
nell
half
pushed
aside
the
heavy
folds
of
canvas
and
looked
out
at
me
her
charming
face
was
for
an
instant
within
twelve
inches
of
mine
i
drew
back
in
resignation
with
my
own
hand
i
had
given
her
to
another
whether
or
no
she
would
eventually
become
his
i
could
not
tell
but
i
felt
that
after
what
i
had
done
she
would
never
belong
to
me
there
was
however
very
little
time
to
think
of
that
now
my
business
was
pressing
come
outside
in
the
passage
a
minute
i
said
in
a
low
voice
still
hearing
no
sound
from
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
i
want
to
speak
to
you
lady
macnairne
she
began
i
put
my
finger
to
my
lips
sh
said
i
oh
did
you
know
she
was
ill
asked
nell
i
shook
my
head
she
is
poor
dear
she
had
the
most
sudden
attack
just
after
we
came
down
and
phyllis
and
i
have
been
able
to
leave
her
she
would
let
one
of
us
go
up
to
tell
you
wonderful
little
woman
i
could
scarcely
refrain
from
exclaiming
her
cleverness
i
mean
her
consideration
is
extraordinary
it
was
her
heart
explained
nell
she
been
lying
down
ever
since
holding
phyllis
hand
and
mine
but
she
better
now
and
i
not
sure
she
has
gone
to
sleep
for
when
i
heard
you
call
me
and
tried
to
slip
my
hand
out
of
hers
she
did
seem
to
notice
she
would
i
said
to
myself
where
tibe
i
asked
aloud
she
using
him
for
a
footstool
all
accounted
for
and
under
control
yes
thrice
wonderful
little
woman
we
could
see
anything
of
the
race
after
all
went
on
nell
did
we
beat
that
what
i
come
to
talk
to
you
about
i
said
not
knowing
in
the
least
what
i
was
going
to
say
next
it
turned
out
i
went
on
slowly
that
a
man
i
er
know
was
on
board
the
boat
we
were
racing
we
beat
it
but
we
did
beat
him
for
he
walked
on
board
since
we
been
jammed
by
a
couple
of
brutes
on
barges
oh
no
harm
done
do
be
worried
the
man
is
in
fact
sir
alec
macnairne
oh
the
nice
man
we
met
at
amsterdam
and
again
at
leeuwarden
when
we
we
she
blushed
at
the
recollection
he
a
distant
relation
of
hush
please
do
speak
her
name
or
his
loud
enough
for
either
to
hear
i
whispered
i
ca
explain
all
to
you
but
will
you
trust
me
why
of
course
said
my
lost
angel
sir
alec
macnairne
thinks
his
wife
is
on
board
and
he
very
angry
with
brederode
and
me
because
you
see
he
and
his
wife
have
had
a
quarrel
i
vaguely
explained
he
got
everything
mixed
up
and
because
he
heard
that
a
lady
macnairne
on
this
boat
he
been
chasing
us
full
of
fury
he
silly
enough
to
believe
that
in
love
with
his
wife
and
i
ca
make
you
understand
precisely
why
without
giving
away
a
secret
of
my
that
nonsense
of
his
is
likely
to
work
lady
macnairne
a
lot
of
harm
what
a
shame
exclaimed
sympathetic
but
puzzled
nell
ca
anything
be
done
about
it
something
has
been
done
said
i
that
what
i
want
you
to
forgive
me
for
and
and
help
me
to
carry
out
for
aunt
fay
sake
poor
aunt
fay
who
suffering
with
her
heart
at
this
minute
what
will
she
have
to
endure
if
you
do
stand
by
her
i
stand
by
her
with
all
my
might
and
main
said
nell
what
can
i
do
i
breaking
it
to
you
by
degrees
the
first
degree
is
i
told
sir
alec
that
alb
was
is
in
love
with
you
oh
how
you
it
was
fatally
easy
and
then
i
said
you
were
engaged
to
him
the
second
degree
and
the
third
and
last
is
that
i
beg
and
implore
you
to
come
on
deck
with
me
and
tell
him
it
true
the
girl
had
actually
turned
pale
i
ca
possibly
anything
else
but
not
that
she
said
it
the
one
thing
to
save
my
poor
aunt
miss
van
buren
nell
i
tell
you
frankly
if
you
wo
do
this
she
i
afraid
she
wo
much
longer
be
lady
macnairne
good
gracious
how
awful
stammered
the
girl
tragic
i
agreed
and
for
me
but
i
say
nothing
of
my
feelings
you
know
how
devoted
i
am
to
my
aunt
she
be
alone
in
the
world
with
tibe
if
you
refuse
to
sacrifice
yourself
in
this
way
for
her
nell
face
was
now
white
and
set
i
felt
a
brute
but
what
was
i
to
do
for
the
sake
of
every
one
concerned
i
could
have
the
exposed
or
be
exposed
myself
and
the
trip
broken
up
at
the
last
in
contumely
for
all
i
hung
on
her
lips
where
is
jonkheer
brederode
she
asked
he
on
deck
too
and
you
expect
me
to
say
before
him
that
he
said
the
same
already
or
at
least
he
agreed
while
i
said
it
oh
well
i
do
see
how
i
to
go
through
with
it
but
for
lady
macnairne
sake
i
do
it
come
let
get
it
over
wait
a
minute
i
urged
restraining
her
impatience
i
must
explain
a
little
more
first
after
sir
alec
has
talked
with
you
he
want
to
come
below
to
the
cabins
and
everywhere
searching
for
his
wife
for
he
wo
believe
till
he
made
sure
with
his
own
eyes
that
she
not
on
board
if
you
willing
that
he
should
i
am
but
do
tell
him
that
a
person
named
lady
macnairne
really
with
us
or
i
ca
answer
for
the
consequences
if
he
comes
below
he
see
her
that
does
matter
as
they
never
met
so
long
as
he
does
know
her
name
very
well
he
sha
learn
it
from
me
and
he
must
from
miss
rivers
will
you
warn
your
stepsister
not
under
any
provocation
whatever
to
speak
the
name
of
lady
macnairne
i
will
but
why
could
you
have
said
phil
was
engaged
to
jonkheer
brederode
robert
van
buren
would
have
stood
it
i
see
but
what
about
him
it
no
use
my
telling
him
anything
he
would
go
and
do
the
opposite
he
sitting
in
the
outer
cabin
alone
where
lady
macnairne
asked
him
to
stay
and
keep
guard
over
her
while
phyllis
and
i
stopped
beside
her
in
the
inner
room
dear
aunt
fay
i
murmured
if
you
just
warn
miss
rivers
and
tell
my
aunt
that
she
better
be
asleep
when
sir
alec
macnairne
peeps
in
i
tackle
your
cousin
come
then
said
nell
and
i
followed
her
into
that
tasteful
little
cabin
which
in
the
dim
past
i
decorated
for
my
own
use
luckily
it
is
a
far
more
difficult
task
to
persuade
robert
van
buren
to
say
something
than
not
to
say
anything
at
all
and
though
he
was
puzzled
and
not
too
pleased
at
being
plunged
into
a
mystery
i
extorted
from
him
a
promise
to
glare
as
much
as
he
liked
at
the
intruder
but
not
on
any
account
to
speak
he
wo
know
you
understand
english
i
said
determining
to
strengthen
in
sir
alec
mind
by
every
means
in
my
power
the
impression
of
robert
dutchness
i
had
just
arranged
matters
when
nell
came
back
with
the
strained
air
of
a
martyr
who
hears
the
lions
we
went
up
on
deck
together
and
a
glance
showed
sir
alec
that
no
introduction
was
needed
what
this
is
miss
van
buren
the
young
lady
who
is
engaged
to
marry
jonkheer
brederode
he
exclaimed
nell
bowed
thankful
no
doubt
that
his
way
of
putting
it
relieved
her
of
the
necessity
for
words
you
said
in
leeuwarden
that
you
did
know
the
two
young
ladies
in
dutch
costumes
my
flung
at
me
you
may
have
gathered
that
impression
i
certainly
never
said
so
i
answered
promptly
and
truthfully
too
perhaps
i
thought
at
the
time
that
the
less
attention
bestowed
on
the
ladies
the
better
they
would
be
pleased
i
added
you
were
right
remarked
nell
bravely
oh
very
well
said
sir
alec
then
abruptly
how
the
dog
he
as
nice
as
ever
replied
the
girl
silence
for
an
instant
macnairne
was
visibly
reflecting
the
sight
of
miss
van
buren
and
her
tacit
confirmation
of
my
statement
was
cooling
him
down
he
is
a
gentleman
and
a
good
fellow
when
not
in
one
of
his
jealous
rages
and
evidently
he
did
not
wish
to
distress
her
or
shake
her
faith
in
a
man
she
was
going
to
marry
i
expected
to
find
my
wife
on
board
this
boat
he
said
at
last
abruptly
is
she
here
no
said
nell
she
is
not
and
never
has
been
it
your
boat
not
brederode
it
my
boat
he
is
kindly
acting
as
our
skipper
if
you
would
care
to
go
below
and
satisfy
yourself
that
la
that
your
wife
is
on
board
please
do
so
sir
alec
looked
at
her
and
she
looked
at
him
straight
in
the
eyes
as
why
should
she
not
poor
girl
having
no
guilty
secret
of
her
own
to
conceal
thank
you
he
said
if
i
your
word
for
it
that
enough
i
go
below
instead
i
will
bid
you
good
afternoon
and
get
back
to
my
own
boat
if
i
can
but
first
starr
do
you
know
where
my
wife
is
i
do
said
i
that
i
swear
i
only
wish
i
did
and
i
tell
you
like
a
shot
why
do
you
advertise
in
the
papers
home
forget
and
forgive
i
do
the
same
or
something
of
the
sort
i
perfectly
sure
that
would
fetch
her
for
she
very
fond
of
you
you
know
or
ought
to
know
she
told
me
once
that
in
spite
of
all
you
were
one
of
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
did
she
really
the
poor
chap
asked
his
face
flushing
up
not
with
rage
this
time
she
did
indeed
thank
you
he
said
he
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
spoke
quickly
well
brederode
i
not
sure
that
i
ought
to
apologize
i
sure
sir
alec
alb
answered
but
he
was
smiling
here
goes
then
the
big
scotsman
held
out
his
hand
the
tall
dutchman
in
the
blue
overalls
took
it
i
do
know
about
you
starr
said
sir
alec
i
inclined
to
feel
that
you
at
all
events
have
treated
me
rather
badly
as
my
wife
i
meant
well
all
through
i
broke
in
hurriedly
and
just
now
i
gave
you
a
bit
of
good
advice
you
thank
me
when
you
taken
it
perhaps
i
will
take
it
he
muttered
hurrah
said
alb
the
grand
pressure
of
the
whole
flock
of
us
is
forcing
the
barrier
apart
we
shall
make
our
way
through
in
a
few
minutes
now
then
all
exclaimed
sir
alec
i
must
be
getting
back
to
my
boat
the
bargees
do
mind
me
much
now
it
dawned
on
their
intelligence
that
i
neither
mad
nor
an
anarchist
brederode
i
congratulate
you
on
your
engagement
to
miss
van
buren
i
hope
miss
van
buren
that
you
will
be
very
happy
as
for
me
probably
i
shall
leave
holland
with
that
he
turned
his
back
upon
us
resolutely
and
made
off
scrambling
on
board
the
barge
jammed
nearest
mascotte
side
so
he
went
on
from
one
to
another
until
he
had
disappeared
from
sight
miss
van
buren
said
brederode
can
you
forgive
us
it
is
hard
she
said
picking
up
a
fold
of
her
white
dress
and
playing
with
it
nervously
but
we
wo
talk
of
it
any
more
ever
i
must
go
now
and
see
how
lady
macnairne
is
not
yet
one
moment
there
something
i
must
say
in
justice
to
myself
brederode
persisted
she
hesitated
and
there
was
that
in
her
face
that
in
his
voice
which
made
me
realize
suddenly
that
my
explanations
were
not
needed
i
could
trust
alb
not
to
give
me
away
and
as
for
him
he
had
forgotten
all
about
me
so
had
nell
and
i
crept
off
unnoticed
the
one
place
for
me
was
on
board
waterspin
and
before
the
barrier
had
done
more
than
show
signs
of
yielding
i
crawled
over
slinking
into
my
cabin
well
well
i
said
to
myself
well
well
i
said
again
with
my
head
between
my
hands
as
i
sat
on
my
lonely
bunk
there
seemed
nothing
else
to
say
i
stayed
for
a
long
time
until
the
press
had
broken
and
we
were
going
on
at
full
speed
once
more
then
i
went
to
a
window
of
the
kitchen
which
phyllis
so
much
admired
and
looked
out
i
could
see
the
deck
of
mascotte
and
brederode
and
nell
who
were
still
alone
there
together
well
well
i
repeated
idiotically
it
i
who
did
that
if
it
been
for
me
but
i
do
know
i
suppose
it
was
bound
to
happen
anyway
i
wonder
then
i
returned
to
my
cabin
and
flitted
about
restlessly
soon
i
became
conscious
that
i
was
humming
an
air
it
was
not
in
itself
a
sad
air
but
there
was
a
certain
sadness
as
well
as
appropriateness
in
its
meaning
for
me
agreeable
girls
away
one
for
you
and
one
for
you
but
never
how
does
it
go
never
one
for
me
we
were
stopping
we
had
come
to
middelburg
i
looked
out
again
nell
was
on
deck
alone
doubtless
alb
had
at
last
gone
below
to
the
and
was
exchanging
the
blue
overalls
for
something
more
decorous
would
he
even
for
the
sake
of
conventionality
have
left
her
at
such
a
moment
unless
everything
were
settled
mascotte
and
waterspin
were
at
rest
and
i
could
avail
myself
of
alb
absence
to
find
out
if
i
liked
i
was
not
at
all
sure
that
i
did
like
nevertheless
something
urged
me
to
go
and
before
i
quite
knew
how
or
why
i
had
come
there
i
stood
beside
the
pretty
white
figure
nell
looked
up
at
me
radiant
with
emotion
oh
starr
you
were
just
the
one
i
wanted
to
see
she
exclaimed
i
was
you
to
come
well
i
came
i
said
smiling
i
glad
you
want
me
i
want
to
ask
you
what
to
do
i
sent
him
away
you
know
we
must
stop
on
board
till
lady
macnairne
better
so
there
no
hurry
and
he
had
to
change
at
first
he
go
without
an
answer
but
i
told
him
i
have
ten
minutes
to
make
up
my
mind
he
explained
everything
he
was
never
to
blame
it
was
all
freule
menela
fault
and
mine
please
say
what
you
think
you
know
him
so
well
you
old
friends
there
no
one
else
i
can
talk
to
and
i
feel
somehow
i
have
for
a
long
time
almost
as
if
you
were
a
kind
of
adopted
brother
brother
again
blow
after
blow
let
them
fall
now
one
upon
another
i
had
feared
this
yet
would
not
expect
it
but
i
suppose
i
must
unwittingly
have
been
born
a
brother
that
right
said
i
go
on
little
sister
the
words
were
getting
quite
familiar
now
he
says
that
he
has
never
stopped
loving
me
dreadfully
desperately
from
the
very
first
but
i
was
sure
it
was
only
a
fancy
and
and
that
when
i
was
so
bad
to
him
and
phyllis
so
kind
he
began
to
care
for
her
instead
just
now
when
you
said
i
must
pretend
to
be
engaged
to
him
i
was
thinking
how
horrid
it
would
be
for
him
to
feel
if
it
were
only
phyllis
did
you
suppose
he
was
in
love
with
phyllis
never
i
heard
myself
assuring
her
never
i
glad
you
sure
then
that
he
knows
his
own
mind
that
he
is
asking
me
to
go
on
being
really
engaged
to
him
just
to
save
my
feelings
after
that
scene
with
sir
alec
macnairne
i
sure
i
said
you
perfect
dear
i
like
you
oh
was
it
too
funny
i
can
say
it
now
we
brother
and
sister
he
thought
i
might
be
in
love
with
owl
i
remarked
and
all
the
time
i
was
so
horribly
afraid
he
might
suspect
i
cared
that
i
would
hardly
speak
a
word
to
him
besides
i
did
suppose
he
could
be
bothered
listening
to
anything
might
have
to
say
and
i
felt
quite
for
him
when
phyllis
was
engaged
to
robert
dear
phil
i
been
horrid
to
her
too
you
see
she
was
trying
to
persuade
herself
to
take
rudolph
without
loving
him
and
i
just
her
for
it
oh
that
was
what
you
meant
then
i
exclaimed
what
i
meant
it
does
matter
well
make
your
mind
easy
sweet
sister
alb
adores
you
has
adored
you
since
the
first
moment
he
set
eyes
on
you
and
will
till
he
closes
them
in
death
that
my
conviction
as
his
lifetime
friend
and
my
advice
is
go
on
being
engaged
to
him
until
you
marry
him
mariner
what
an
old
trump
you
are
broke
in
brederode
and
there
he
was
behind
me
neat
as
a
pin
in
his
own
suit
of
clothes
and
radiant
in
his
new
suit
of
happiness
i
give
her
to
you
alb
said
i
and
then
i
strolled
away
again
humming
to
the
air
of
the
dead
march
in
saul
or
something
equivalent
those
haunting
words
agreeable
girls
away
one
for
you
and
one
for
you
but
never
never
one
for
me
xxxvii
i
felt
when
i
waked
up
on
the
morning
of
at
middelburg
as
if
i
had
not
slept
at
all
but
had
listened
throughout
the
night
to
the
sweet
the
incredibly
sweet
chimes
that
floated
like
perfume
in
the
air
yet
i
suppose
i
must
have
slept
for
the
bells
had
sometimes
stopped
playing
their
one
melodious
tune
to
tinkle
in
my
dreams
one
for
you
and
one
for
you
but
never
one
for
me
the
hotel
is
a
nice
hotel
and
there
is
a
garden
after
breakfast
i
was
so
tired
of
brotherliness
of
beaming
at
happy
couples
and
hearing
plans
about
weddings
that
instead
of
going
forth
to
see
the
famous
thursday
middelburg
sights
at
which
the
world
comes
from
afar
to
gaze
i
slipped
away
and
hid
in
the
garden
phyllis
and
robert
were
out
together
rudolph
and
nell
were
out
together
both
parties
conscientiously
believed
that
they
were
out
for
that
their
object
was
to
behold
matrons
and
maidens
in
white
caps
quaint
fichus
meek
straight
bodices
and
swelling
skirts
to
admire
pretty
faces
with
tinkling
gold
ornaments
at
their
temples
to
stare
at
young
arms
red
under
incredibly
tight
short
sleeves
as
they
bore
baskets
of
eggs
or
pats
of
butter
to
market
how
well
i
knew
the
whole
scene
from
photographs
the
figures
of
the
women
the
booths
in
the
big
market
square
and
the
cool
arcades
of
the
how
well
i
knew
too
that
neither
phyllis
and
robert
nor
rudolph
and
nell
would
see
anything
at
all
or
remember
it
if
by
accident
they
did
see
aught
save
each
other
this
i
said
to
myself
is
the
end
we
may
go
back
to
rotterdam
together
if
we
like
but
everything
as
much
changed
as
if
it
were
another
party
and
this
this
is
what
i
slaved
for
fibbed
for
plotted
for
agreeable
girls
away
faugh
i
felt
as
much
injured
as
if
i
were
a
misunderstood
saint
though
when
one
comes
to
look
at
it
perhaps
i
have
not
always
played
precisely
the
part
of
saint
while
i
lolled
gloomily
on
an
extremely
uncomfortable
seat
not
meant
for
lolling
i
heard
a
faint
rustling
in
the
grass
behind
me
and
tibe
appeared
to
lay
his
head
in
a
way
upon
my
knee
where
your
mistress
i
asked
mechanically
have
you
changed
too
like
all
the
rest
and
left
her
alone
here
i
am
answered
the
as
if
the
question
had
been
addressed
to
her
i
thought
you
be
in
the
garden
so
i
came
to
find
you
why
do
you
go
out
and
see
things
why
do
you
i
echoed
because
i
did
like
to
feel
that
you
were
all
by
yourself
she
answered
you
need
have
troubled
about
me
i
said
nobody
else
does
she
laughed
that
quaint
quiet
little
laugh
which
suits
her
different
they
engaged
to
each
other
all
the
rest
of
them
engaged
you
do
let
that
engagement
keep
you
from
amusing
yourself
i
said
the
bargain
off
now
i
hired
an
aunt
to
further
my
interests
every
one
else
have
been
furthered
except
mine
that
not
my
fault
is
it
i
know
it
is
i
assured
her
do
think
i
finding
fault
with
you
on
the
contrary
you
really
a
marvelous
being
but
occupation
gone
yes
said
she
for
both
of
us
i
retire
from
aunthood
you
retire
from
nephewhood
with
mutual
respect
is
that
it
i
suppose
so
i
gloomily
replied
yet
i
loth
to
part
with
you
somehow
you
and
tibe
are
all
i
have
left
in
the
world
but
now
i
must
lose
you
both
you
do
need
an
aunt
she
said
no
but
i
need
some
one
i
do
know
exactly
who
robert
has
snatched
one
of
my
loves
rudolph
the
other
what
am
i
to
do
come
to
the
house
and
into
my
and
let
talk
it
over
she
suggested
invitingly
i
obeyed
there
were
flowers
in
her
there
always
are
the
scent
of
late
roses
was
sad
yet
soothing
excuse
me
a
minute
i
going
into
the
next
room
to
make
myself
pretty
before
we
begin
our
talk
but
i
wo
be
long
and
tibe
shall
keep
you
company
said
the
you
well
enough
as
you
are
i
said
but
she
went
smiling
and
i
hardly
missed
her
i
was
so
busy
with
my
own
thoughts
for
you
and
one
for
you
but
never
never
one
for
me
i
must
have
hummed
the
words
aloud
for
her
voice
answered
me
at
the
door
never
a
long
word
is
it
i
looked
up
a
neat
little
figure
stood
on
the
threshold
between
the
two
rooms
the
same
neat
little
figure
i
had
seen
constantly
during
the
past
eight
weeks
but
it
was
not
the
same
face
she
had
said
lightly
that
she
was
going
to
make
herself
pretty
and
she
had
she
had
performed
a
miracle
or
else
i
was
asleep
and
dreaming
the
gray
hair
folded
in
wings
was
gone
the
blue
glasses
were
gone
the
big
bow
under
the
chin
was
gone
a
pretty
young
woman
was
smiling
at
me
with
the
pretty
little
mouth
i
knew
but
i
did
not
know
the
bright
auburn
hair
or
the
beautiful
brown
eyes
that
threw
me
an
amazing
challenge
good
heavens
i
exclaimed
you
told
me
you
did
want
your
aunt
any
more
said
she
who
are
you
i
asked
do
you
remember
i
mary
milton
if
you
lived
in
your
own
country
instead
of
gadding
about
in
foreign
ones
you
know
who
mary
milton
is
without
asking
at
least
you
would
if
you
ever
read
new
york
i
suppose
this
is
a
dream
and
that
i
shall
wake
up
said
i
i
slept
very
badly
last
night
do
call
for
help
under
the
impression
that
it
a
nightmare
said
my
late
aunt
twinkling
i
have
the
impression
that
it
a
vision
i
answered
but
if
you
do
explain
yourself
instantly
i
shall
die
in
the
dream
of
heart
failure
there
no
great
mystery
said
miss
milton
i
did
particularly
want
to
disguise
myself
but
you
advertised
for
an
aunt
and
as
difficult
for
a
girl
to
make
herself
look
i
had
to
look
that
all
except
that
your
advertisement
came
in
very
handy
because
as
you
know
if
you
were
a
patriotic
american
mary
an
enterprising
and
rather
celebrated
young
journalist
making
it
her
business
to
go
round
the
world
for
her
paper
without
spending
a
penny
of
her
own
that
was
the
understanding
on
which
started
and
me
for
it
was
my
own
idea
i
wanted
to
see
things
and
i
had
money
enough
so
i
went
to
call
on
the
editor
and
i
talked
to
him
till
he
was
quite
fired
with
the
project
has
given
me
a
good
and
i
given
it
good
copy
my
adventures
as
they
look
in
print
have
been
sensational
and
i
believe
popular
i
been
at
it
for
two
years
and
all
america
has
read
me
if
you
have
done
all
the
countries
of
europe
now
holland
was
the
last
and
i
seemed
stuck
on
the
threshold
till
i
saw
your
advertisement
it
have
suited
better
except
for
the
blue
glasses
and
the
wig
but
one
ca
have
everything
as
one
likes
it
i
enjoyed
the
tour
immensely
thanks
to
you
and
so
have
the
readers
of
i
afraid
i
teased
you
a
good
deal
and
spent
a
lot
of
your
pennies
but
it
fun
and
you
shall
have
your
presents
all
back
every
one
of
them
heaps
of
money
will
be
waiting
for
me
from
my
paper
when
i
get
home
to
new
york
they
delighted
with
my
work
and
then
i
intend
to
send
you
a
check
for
all
that
you
paid
me
to
be
your
aunt
i
would
rather
and
only
keep
one
little
thing
to
remember
you
by
perhaps
and
our
days
together
did
you
always
send
back
the
money
spent
by
persons
you
hypnotized
to
conduct
you
through
the
different
countries
no
that
was
different
i
do
exactly
know
why
but
it
was
and
you
need
look
at
me
so
queerly
i
never
done
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
i
knock
the
person
down
who
suggested
that
you
had
said
i
i
was
looking
at
you
because
i
was
thinking
you
more
marvelous
than
ever
you
hypnotize
you
hypnotize
everybody
i
suppose
you
hypnotized
the
editor
into
giving
you
your
job
perhaps
i
did
she
laughed
often
i
can
get
people
to
do
things
for
me
big
things
if
i
want
them
to
very
much
you
could
get
me
to
do
anything
i
exclaimed
you
a
witch
and
what
more
i
believe
you
a
beauty
great
scott
how
you
grow
on
one
can
this
be
why
because
you
are
you
that
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
do
care
a
rap
if
nell
and
phyllis
are
engaged
to
others
i
wonder
if
my
instinct
saw
under
the
gray
hair
and
blue
glasses
look
here
are
you
miss
or
mary
milton
and
if
you
are
you
a
widow
grass
or
otherwise
she
laughed
why
how
old
do
you
take
me
to
be
as
an
aunt
my
official
age
was
over
forty
but
miss
mary
milton
is
much
more
than
half
lady
macnairne
age
it
as
good
to
throw
off
the
years
as
the
wig
and
the
spectacles
i
only
i
have
had
to
marry
yet
thank
goodness
thank
goodness
i
echoed
and
thank
goodness
for
you
as
you
are
you
seem
to
me
perfect
but
i
should
never
have
done
like
this
for
an
aunt
certainly
not
but
to
think
i
should
have
been
wasting
you
all
this
time
as
a
mere
aunt
i
was
wasted
i
saved
you
lots
of
things
if
i
did
save
you
money
really
i
earn
my
salary
though
you
often
thought
me
officious
never
not
when
i
kept
you
from
proposing
to
nell
van
buren
that
was
a
blessing
in
disguise
like
myself
but
truly
i
only
did
it
to
spare
you
humiliation
in
the
end
i
knew
all
along
that
she
was
in
love
with
rudolph
brederode
though
perhaps
would
have
found
it
out
so
soon
if
it
had
been
for
me
you
been
our
good
genius
all
round
said
i
and
i
owe
you
now
do
offer
me
more
rewards
it
was
fun
wheedling
things
from
you
at
first
but
bribes
have
been
getting
on
my
nerves
lately
the
play
was
played
out
let
pretend
it
was
only
a
i
suggested
i
like
you
to
be
in
the
next
piece
in
the
leading
part
mary
milton
what
a
delicious
name
and
delicious
it
a
great
comfort
to
understand
why
i
was
never
really
in
love
with
either
of
those
angels
you
are
not
an
angel
but
i
going
to
be
madly
in
love
with
you
i
feel
it
coming
on
i
shall
adore
you
nonsense
a
man
must
be
in
love
with
his
aunt
i
strip
you
of
your
aunthood
but
i
ca
give
you
up
to
if
you
go
to
america
you
must
personally
conduct
ronald
lester
starr
you
ought
to
mind
you
used
to
looking
after
him
i
took
a
step
toward
her
but
she
stooped
down
and
framed
the
ugly
pansy
of
tibe
face
between
her
little
hands
tibe
what
do
you
say
to
him
she
asked
tibe
wagged
his
tail
while
he
was
wagging
the
others
came
in
their
looks
of
radiant
new
happiness
changed
to
surprise
at
sight
of
my
companion
in
spite
of
the
dress
nobody
recognized
the
pretty
girl
with
the
wonderful
eyes
and
crisp
masses
of
sparkling
auburn
hair
yesterday
i
would
have
sacrificed
anything
up
to
tibe
himself
to
avoid
explanations
but
now
i
enjoyed
them
everybody
laughed
and
exclaimed
except
robert
and
brederode
helped
me
out
so
nobly
that
i
would
have
given
him
nell
with
my
own
hand
if
she
had
not
already
made
him
that
present
it
like
one
of
nell
stories
cried
phyllis
only
she
used
to
love
to
make
hers
end
sadly
i
should
have
died
if
this
had
ended
sadly
nell
said
frankly
holding
out
both
hands
to
brederode
with
a
lovely
look
in
her
eyes
so
should
i
i
sure
said
phyllis
oh
is
it
glorious
that
we
all
adore
each
other
so
do
we
i
asked
the
lady
she
smiled
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
pity
to
make
a
jarring
note
in
the
chorus
while
she
was
in
that
mood
i
took
out
the
ruby
ring
which
she
had
said
ought
to
be
an
engagement
ring
with
this
ring
i
thee
no
engage
thee
as
my
perpetual
chaperon
this
time
she
did
not
draw
back
her
hand
and
i
kissed
it
as
i
slipped
on
the
ruby
the
end
