the
grill
is
the
club
most
difficult
of
access
in
the
world
to
be
placed
on
its
rolls
distinguishes
the
new
member
as
greatly
as
though
he
had
received
a
vacant
garter
or
had
been
caricatured
in
vanity
men
who
belong
to
the
grill
club
never
mention
that
fact
if
you
were
to
ask
one
of
them
which
clubs
he
frequents
he
will
name
all
save
that
particular
one
he
is
afraid
if
he
told
you
he
belonged
to
the
grill
that
it
would
sound
like
boasting
the
grill
club
dates
back
to
the
days
when
shakespeare
s
theatre
stood
on
the
present
site
of
the
times
office
it
has
a
golden
grill
which
charles
the
second
presented
to
the
club
and
the
original
manuscript
of
tom
and
jerry
in
london
which
was
bequeathed
to
it
by
pierce
egan
himself
the
members
when
they
write
letters
at
the
club
still
use
sand
to
blot
the
ink
the
grill
enjoys
the
distinction
of
having
blackballed
without
political
prejudice
a
prime
minister
of
each
party
at
the
same
sitting
at
which
one
of
these
fell
it
elected
on
account
of
his
brogue
and
his
bulls
quiller
who
was
then
a
penniless
barrister
when
paul
preval
the
french
artist
who
came
to
london
by
royal
command
to
paint
a
portrait
of
the
prince
of
wales
was
made
an
honorary
member
only
foreigners
may
be
honorary
members
he
said
as
he
signed
his
first
wine
card
i
would
rather
see
my
name
on
that
than
on
a
picture
in
the
at
which
quiller
remarked
that
is
a
devil
of
a
compliment
because
the
only
men
who
can
read
their
names
in
the
louvre
have
been
dead
fifty
on
the
night
after
the
great
fog
of
there
were
five
members
in
the
club
four
of
them
busy
with
supper
and
one
reading
in
front
of
the
fireplace
there
is
only
one
room
to
the
club
and
one
long
table
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
the
fire
of
the
grill
glows
red
and
when
the
fat
falls
blazes
into
flame
and
at
the
other
there
is
a
broad
bow
window
of
diamond
panes
which
looks
down
upon
the
street
the
four
men
at
the
table
were
strangers
to
each
other
but
as
they
picked
at
the
grilled
bones
and
sipped
their
scotch
and
soda
they
conversed
with
such
charming
animation
that
a
visitor
to
the
club
which
does
not
tolerate
visitors
would
have
counted
them
as
friends
of
long
acquaintance
certainly
not
as
englishmen
who
had
met
for
the
first
time
and
without
the
form
of
an
introduction
but
it
is
the
etiquette
and
tradition
of
the
grill
that
whoever
enters
it
must
speak
with
whomever
he
finds
there
it
is
to
enforce
this
rule
that
there
is
but
one
long
table
and
whether
there
are
twenty
men
at
it
or
two
the
waiters
supporting
the
rule
will
place
them
side
by
side
for
this
reason
the
four
strangers
at
supper
were
seated
together
with
the
candles
grouped
about
them
and
the
long
length
of
the
table
cutting
a
white
path
through
the
outer
gloom
i
repeat
said
the
gentleman
with
the
black
pearl
stud
that
the
days
for
romantic
adventure
and
deeds
of
foolish
daring
have
passed
and
that
the
fault
lies
with
ourselves
voyages
to
the
pole
i
do
not
catalogue
as
adventures
that
african
explorer
young
chetney
who
turned
up
yesterday
after
he
was
supposed
to
have
died
in
uganda
did
nothing
adventurous
he
made
maps
and
explored
the
sources
of
rivers
he
was
in
constant
danger
but
the
presence
of
danger
does
not
constitute
adventure
were
that
so
the
chemist
who
studies
high
explosives
or
who
investigates
deadly
poisons
passes
through
adventures
daily
no
adventures
are
for
the
but
one
no
longer
ventures
the
spirit
of
it
has
died
of
inertia
we
are
grown
too
practical
too
just
above
all
too
sensible
in
this
room
for
instance
members
of
this
club
have
at
the
sword
s
point
disputed
the
proper
scanning
of
one
of
pope
s
couplets
over
so
weighty
a
matter
as
spilled
burgundy
on
a
gentleman
s
cuff
ten
men
fought
across
this
table
each
with
his
rapier
in
one
hand
and
a
candle
in
the
other
all
ten
were
wounded
the
question
of
the
spilled
burgundy
concerned
but
two
of
them
the
eight
others
engaged
because
they
were
men
of
they
were
indeed
the
first
gentlemen
of
the
day
were
you
to
spill
burgundy
on
my
cuff
were
you
even
to
insult
me
grossly
these
gentlemen
would
not
consider
it
incumbent
upon
them
to
kill
each
other
they
would
separate
us
and
morning
appear
as
witnesses
against
us
at
bow
street
we
have
here
in
the
persons
of
sir
andrew
and
myself
an
illustration
of
how
the
ways
have
the
men
around
the
table
turned
and
glanced
toward
the
gentleman
in
front
of
the
fireplace
he
was
an
elderly
and
somewhat
portly
person
with
a
kindly
wrinkled
countenance
which
wore
continually
a
smile
of
almost
childish
confidence
and
it
was
a
face
which
the
illustrated
prints
had
made
intimately
familiar
he
held
a
book
from
him
at
arm
as
if
to
adjust
his
eyesight
and
his
brows
were
knit
with
interest
illustration
the
men
around
the
table
turned
now
were
this
the
eighteenth
century
continued
the
gentleman
with
the
black
pearl
when
sir
andrew
left
the
club
i
would
have
him
bound
and
gagged
and
thrown
into
a
sedan
chair
the
watch
would
not
interfere
the
would
take
to
their
heels
my
hired
bullies
and
ruffians
would
convey
him
to
some
lonely
spot
where
we
would
guard
him
until
morning
nothing
would
come
of
it
except
added
reputation
to
myself
as
a
gentleman
of
adventurous
spirit
and
possibly
an
essay
in
the
tatler
with
stars
for
names
entitled
let
us
say
the
budget
and
the
but
to
what
end
sir
inquired
the
youngest
of
the
members
and
why
sir
andrew
of
all
persons
why
should
you
select
him
for
this
adventure
the
gentleman
with
the
black
pearl
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
would
prevent
him
speaking
in
the
house
the
navy
increase
bill
he
added
gloomily
it
is
a
government
measure
and
sir
andrew
speaks
for
it
and
so
great
is
his
influence
and
so
large
his
following
that
if
he
does
the
gentleman
laughed
ruefully
if
he
does
it
will
go
through
now
had
i
the
spirit
of
our
ancestors
he
exclaimed
i
would
bring
chloroform
from
the
nearest
chemist
s
and
drug
him
in
that
chair
i
would
tumble
his
unconscious
form
into
a
hansom
cab
and
hold
him
prisoner
until
daylight
if
i
did
i
would
save
the
british
taxpayer
the
cost
of
five
more
battleships
many
millions
of
illustration
i
would
tumble
his
unconscious
form
into
a
hansom
cab
the
gentlemen
again
turned
and
surveyed
the
baronet
with
freshened
interest
the
honorary
member
of
the
grill
whose
accent
already
had
betrayed
him
as
an
american
laughed
softly
to
look
at
him
now
he
said
one
would
not
guess
he
was
deeply
concerned
with
the
affairs
of
the
others
nodded
silently
he
has
not
lifted
his
eyes
from
that
book
since
we
first
entered
added
the
youngest
member
he
surely
can
not
mean
to
speak
oh
yes
he
will
speak
muttered
the
one
with
the
black
pearl
moodily
during
these
last
hours
of
the
session
the
house
sits
late
but
when
the
navy
bill
comes
up
on
its
third
reading
he
will
be
in
his
place
and
he
will
pass
the
fourth
member
a
stout
and
florid
gentleman
of
a
somewhat
sporting
appearance
in
a
short
and
black
tie
sighed
enviously
fancy
one
of
us
being
as
cool
as
that
if
he
knew
he
had
to
stand
up
within
an
hour
and
rattle
off
a
speech
in
parliament
i
d
be
in
a
devil
of
a
funk
myself
and
yet
he
is
as
keen
over
that
book
he
s
reading
as
though
he
had
nothing
before
him
until
yes
see
how
eager
he
is
whispered
the
youngest
member
he
does
not
lift
his
eyes
even
now
when
he
cuts
the
pages
it
is
probably
an
admiralty
report
or
some
other
weighty
work
of
statistics
which
bears
upon
his
the
gentleman
with
the
black
pearl
laughed
morosely
the
weighty
work
in
which
the
eminent
statesman
is
so
deeply
engrossed
he
said
is
called
the
great
rand
it
is
a
detective
novel
for
sale
at
all
the
american
raised
his
eyebrows
in
disbelief
the
great
rand
robbery
he
repeated
incredulously
what
an
odd
taste
it
is
not
a
taste
it
is
his
vice
returned
the
gentleman
with
the
pearl
stud
it
is
his
one
dissipation
he
is
noted
for
it
you
as
a
stranger
could
hardly
be
expected
to
know
of
this
idiosyncrasy
gladstone
sought
relaxation
in
the
greek
poets
sir
andrew
finds
his
in
gaboriau
since
i
have
been
a
member
of
parliament
i
have
never
seen
him
in
the
library
without
a
shilling
shocker
in
his
hands
he
brings
them
even
into
the
sacred
precincts
of
the
house
and
from
the
government
benches
reads
them
concealed
inside
his
hat
once
started
on
a
tale
of
murder
robbery
and
sudden
death
nothing
can
tear
him
from
it
not
even
the
call
of
the
division
bell
nor
of
hunger
nor
the
prayers
of
the
party
whip
he
gave
up
his
country
house
because
when
he
journeyed
to
it
in
the
train
he
would
become
so
absorbed
in
his
detective
stories
that
he
was
invariably
carried
past
his
the
member
of
parliament
twisted
his
pearl
stud
nervously
and
bit
at
the
edge
of
his
mustache
if
it
only
were
the
first
pages
of
the
rand
robbery
that
he
were
reading
he
murmured
bitterly
instead
of
the
last
with
such
another
book
as
that
i
swear
i
could
hold
him
here
until
morning
there
would
be
no
need
of
chloroform
to
keep
him
from
the
the
eyes
of
all
were
fastened
upon
sir
andrew
and
each
saw
with
fascination
that
with
his
forefinger
he
was
now
separating
the
last
two
pages
of
the
book
the
member
of
parliament
struck
the
table
softly
with
his
open
palm
i
would
give
a
hundred
pounds
he
whispered
if
i
could
place
in
his
hands
at
this
moment
a
new
story
of
sherlock
holmes
a
thousand
pounds
he
added
wildly
five
thousand
pounds
the
american
observed
the
speaker
sharply
as
though
the
words
bore
to
him
some
special
application
and
then
at
an
idea
which
apparently
had
but
just
come
to
him
smiled
in
great
embarrassment
sir
andrew
ceased
reading
but
as
though
still
under
the
influence
of
the
book
sat
looking
blankly
into
the
open
fire
for
a
brief
space
no
one
moved
until
the
baronet
withdrew
his
eyes
and
with
a
sudden
start
of
recollection
felt
anxiously
for
his
watch
he
scanned
its
face
eagerly
and
scrambled
to
his
feet
the
voice
of
the
american
instantly
broke
the
silence
in
a
high
nervous
accent
and
yet
sherlock
holmes
himself
he
cried
could
not
decipher
the
mystery
which
baffles
the
police
of
at
these
unexpected
words
which
carried
in
them
something
of
the
tone
of
a
challenge
the
gentlemen
about
the
table
started
as
suddenly
as
though
the
american
had
fired
a
pistol
in
the
air
and
sir
andrew
halted
abruptly
and
stood
observing
him
with
grave
surprise
the
gentleman
with
the
black
pearl
was
the
first
to
recover
yes
yes
he
said
eagerly
throwing
himself
across
the
table
a
mystery
that
baffles
the
police
of
london
illustration
my
name
he
said
is
i
have
heard
nothing
of
it
tell
us
at
once
pray
do
tell
us
at
the
american
flushed
uncomfortably
and
picked
uneasily
at
the
tablecloth
no
one
but
the
police
has
heard
of
it
he
murmured
and
they
only
through
me
it
is
a
remarkable
crime
to
which
unfortunately
i
am
the
only
person
who
can
bear
witness
because
i
am
the
only
witness
i
am
in
spite
of
my
immunity
as
a
diplomat
detained
in
london
by
the
authorities
of
scotland
yard
my
name
he
said
inclining
his
head
politely
is
sears
lieutenant
ripley
sears
of
the
united
states
navy
at
present
naval
attache
to
the
court
of
russia
had
i
not
been
detained
by
the
police
i
would
have
started
this
morning
for
the
gentleman
with
the
black
pearl
interrupted
with
so
pronounced
an
exclamation
of
excitement
and
delight
that
the
american
stammered
and
ceased
speaking
do
you
hear
sir
andrew
cried
the
member
of
parliament
jubilantly
an
american
diplomat
halted
by
our
police
because
he
is
the
only
witness
of
a
most
remarkable
crime
most
remarkable
crime
i
believe
you
said
sir
he
added
bending
eagerly
toward
the
naval
officer
which
has
occurred
in
london
in
many
the
american
moved
his
head
in
assent
and
glanced
at
the
two
other
members
they
were
looking
doubtfully
at
him
and
the
face
of
each
showed
that
he
was
greatly
perplexed
sir
andrew
advanced
to
within
the
light
of
the
candles
and
drew
a
chair
toward
him
the
crime
must
be
exceptional
indeed
he
said
to
justify
the
police
in
interfering
with
a
representative
of
a
friendly
power
if
i
were
not
forced
to
leave
at
once
i
should
take
the
liberty
of
asking
you
to
tell
us
the
the
gentleman
with
the
pearl
pushed
the
chair
toward
sir
andrew
and
motioned
him
to
be
seated
you
can
not
leave
us
now
he
exclaimed
mr
sears
is
just
about
to
tell
us
of
this
remarkable
he
nodded
vigorously
at
the
naval
officer
and
the
american
after
first
glancing
doubtfully
toward
the
servants
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
leaned
forward
across
the
table
the
others
drew
their
chairs
nearer
and
bent
toward
him
the
baronet
glanced
irresolutely
at
his
watch
and
with
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
snapped
down
the
lid
they
can
wait
he
muttered
he
seated
himself
quickly
and
nodded
at
lieutenant
sears
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
begin
sir
he
said
impatiently
of
course
said
the
american
you
understand
that
i
understand
that
i
am
speaking
to
gentlemen
the
confidences
of
this
club
are
inviolate
until
the
police
give
the
facts
to
the
public
press
i
must
consider
you
my
confederates
you
have
heard
nothing
you
know
no
one
connected
with
this
mystery
even
i
must
remain
the
gentlemen
seated
around
him
nodded
gravely
of
course
the
baronet
assented
with
eagerness
of
we
will
refer
to
it
said
the
gentleman
with
the
black
pearl
as
the
story
of
the
naval
i
arrived
in
london
two
days
ago
said
the
american
and
i
engaged
a
room
at
the
bath
hotel
i
know
very
few
people
in
london
and
even
the
members
of
our
embassy
were
strangers
to
me
but
in
hong
kong
i
had
become
great
pals
with
an
officer
in
your
navy
who
has
since
retired
and
who
is
now
living
in
a
small
house
in
rutland
gardens
opposite
the
knightsbridge
barracks
i
telegraphed
him
that
i
was
in
london
and
yesterday
morning
i
received
a
most
hearty
invitation
to
dine
with
him
the
same
evening
at
his
house
he
is
a
bachelor
so
we
dined
alone
and
talked
over
all
our
old
days
on
the
asiatic
station
and
of
the
changes
which
had
come
to
us
since
we
had
last
met
there
as
i
was
leaving
the
next
morning
for
my
post
at
petersburg
and
had
many
letters
to
write
i
told
him
about
ten
o
clock
that
i
must
get
back
to
the
hotel
and
he
sent
out
his
servant
to
call
a
hansom
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
as
we
sat
talking
we
could
hear
the
cab
whistle
sounding
violently
from
the
doorstep
but
apparently
with
no
result
it
can
not
be
that
the
cabmen
are
on
strike
my
friend
said
as
he
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
he
pulled
back
the
curtains
and
at
once
called
to
me
you
have
never
seen
a
london
fog
have
you
he
asked
well
come
here
this
is
one
of
the
best
or
rather
one
of
the
worst
of
i
joined
him
at
the
window
but
i
could
see
nothing
had
i
not
known
that
the
house
looked
out
upon
the
street
i
would
have
believed
that
i
was
facing
a
dead
wall
i
raised
the
sash
and
stretched
out
my
head
but
still
i
could
see
nothing
even
the
light
of
the
street
lamps
opposite
and
in
the
upper
windows
of
the
barracks
had
been
smothered
in
the
yellow
mist
the
lights
of
the
room
in
which
i
stood
penetrated
the
fog
only
to
the
distance
of
a
few
inches
from
my
eyes
below
me
the
servant
was
still
sounding
his
whistle
but
i
could
afford
to
wait
no
longer
and
told
my
friend
that
i
would
try
and
find
the
way
to
my
hotel
on
foot
he
objected
but
the
letters
i
had
to
write
were
for
the
navy
department
and
besides
i
had
always
heard
that
to
be
out
in
a
london
fog
was
the
most
wonderful
experience
and
i
was
curious
to
investigate
one
for
myself
my
friend
went
with
me
to
his
front
door
and
laid
down
a
course
for
me
to
follow
i
was
first
to
walk
straight
across
the
street
to
the
brick
wall
of
the
knightsbridge
barracks
i
was
then
to
feel
my
way
along
the
wall
until
i
came
to
a
row
of
houses
set
back
from
the
sidewalk
they
would
bring
me
to
a
cross
street
on
the
other
side
of
this
street
was
a
row
of
shops
which
i
was
to
follow
until
they
joined
the
iron
railings
of
hyde
park
i
was
to
keep
to
the
railings
until
i
reached
the
gates
at
hyde
park
corner
where
i
was
to
lay
a
diagonal
course
across
piccadilly
and
tack
in
toward
the
railings
of
green
park
at
the
end
of
these
railings
going
east
i
would
find
the
walsingham
and
my
own
hotel
to
a
sailor
the
course
did
not
seem
difficult
so
i
bade
my
friend
goodnight
and
walked
forward
until
my
feet
touched
the
paving
i
continued
upon
it
until
i
reached
the
curbing
of
the
sidewalk
a
few
steps
further
and
my
hands
struck
the
wall
of
the
barracks
i
turned
in
the
direction
from
which
i
had
just
come
and
saw
a
square
of
faint
light
cut
in
the
yellow
fog
i
shouted
all
right
and
the
voice
of
my
friend
answered
good
luck
to
the
light
from
his
open
door
disappeared
with
a
bang
and
i
was
left
alone
in
a
dripping
yellow
darkness
i
have
been
in
the
navy
for
ten
years
but
i
have
never
known
such
a
fog
as
that
of
last
night
not
even
among
the
icebergs
of
behring
sea
there
one
at
least
could
see
the
light
of
the
binnacle
but
last
night
i
could
not
even
distinguish
the
hand
by
which
i
guided
myself
along
the
barrack
wall
at
sea
a
fog
is
a
natural
phenomenon
it
is
as
familiar
as
the
rainbow
which
follows
a
storm
it
is
as
proper
that
a
fog
should
spread
upon
the
waters
as
that
steam
shall
rise
from
a
kettle
but
a
fog
which
springs
from
the
paved
streets
that
rolls
between
solid
that
forces
cabs
to
move
at
half
speed
that
drowns
policemen
and
extinguishes
the
electric
lights
of
the
music
hall
that
to
me
is
incomprehensible
it
is
as
out
of
place
as
a
tidal
wave
on
broadway
as
i
felt
my
way
along
the
wall
i
encountered
other
men
who
were
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
and
each
time
when
we
hailed
each
other
i
stepped
away
from
the
wall
to
make
room
for
them
to
pass
but
the
third
time
i
did
this
when
i
reached
out
my
hand
the
wall
had
disappeared
and
the
further
i
moved
to
find
it
the
further
i
seemed
to
be
sinking
into
space
i
had
the
unpleasant
conviction
that
at
any
moment
i
might
step
over
a
precipice
since
i
had
set
out
i
had
heard
no
traffic
in
the
street
and
now
although
i
listened
some
minutes
i
could
only
distinguish
the
occasional
footfalls
of
pedestrians
several
times
i
called
aloud
and
once
a
jocular
gentleman
answered
me
but
only
to
ask
me
where
i
thought
he
was
and
then
even
he
was
swallowed
up
in
the
silence
just
above
me
i
could
make
out
a
jet
of
gas
which
i
guessed
came
from
a
street
lamp
and
i
moved
over
to
that
and
while
i
tried
to
recover
my
bearings
kept
my
hand
on
the
iron
post
except
for
this
flicker
of
gas
no
larger
than
the
tip
of
my
finger
i
could
distinguish
nothing
about
me
for
the
rest
the
mist
hung
between
me
and
the
world
like
a
damp
and
heavy
blanket
i
could
hear
voices
but
i
could
not
tell
from
whence
they
came
and
the
scrape
of
a
foot
moving
cautiously
or
a
muffled
cry
as
some
one
stumbled
were
the
only
sounds
that
reached
me
i
decided
that
until
some
one
took
me
in
tow
i
had
best
remain
where
i
was
and
it
must
have
been
for
ten
minutes
that
i
waited
by
the
lamp
straining
my
ears
and
hailing
distant
footfalls
in
a
house
near
me
some
people
were
dancing
to
the
music
of
a
hungarian
band
i
even
fancied
i
could
hear
the
windows
shake
to
the
rhythm
of
their
feet
but
i
could
not
make
out
from
which
part
of
the
compass
the
sounds
came
and
sometimes
as
the
music
rose
it
seemed
close
at
my
hand
and
again
to
be
floating
high
in
the
air
above
my
head
although
i
was
surrounded
by
thousands
of
householders
i
was
as
completely
lost
as
though
i
had
been
set
down
by
night
in
the
sahara
desert
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
in
waiting
longer
for
an
escort
so
i
again
set
out
and
at
once
bumped
against
a
low
iron
fence
at
first
i
believed
this
to
be
an
area
railing
but
on
following
it
i
found
that
it
stretched
for
a
long
distance
and
that
it
was
pierced
at
regular
intervals
with
gates
i
was
standing
uncertainly
with
my
hand
on
one
of
these
when
a
square
of
light
suddenly
opened
in
the
night
and
in
it
i
saw
as
you
see
a
picture
thrown
by
a
biograph
in
a
darkened
theatre
a
young
gentleman
in
evening
dress
and
back
of
him
the
lights
of
a
hall
i
guessed
from
its
elevation
and
distance
from
the
that
this
light
must
come
from
the
door
of
a
house
set
back
from
the
street
and
i
determined
to
approach
it
and
ask
the
young
man
to
tell
me
where
i
was
but
in
fumbling
with
the
lock
of
the
gate
i
instinctively
bent
my
head
and
when
i
raised
it
again
the
door
had
partly
closed
leaving
only
a
narrow
shaft
of
light
whether
the
young
man
had
the
house
or
had
left
it
i
could
not
tell
but
i
hastened
to
open
the
gate
and
as
i
stepped
forward
i
found
myself
upon
an
asphalt
walk
at
the
same
instant
there
was
the
sound
of
quick
steps
upon
the
path
and
some
one
rushed
past
me
i
called
to
him
but
he
made
no
reply
and
i
heard
the
gate
click
and
the
footsteps
hurrying
away
upon
the
sidewalk
illustration
a
square
of
light
suddenly
opened
in
the
night
under
other
circumstances
the
young
man
s
rudeness
and
his
recklessness
in
dashing
so
hurriedly
through
the
mist
would
have
struck
me
as
peculiar
but
everything
was
so
distorted
by
the
fog
that
at
the
moment
i
did
not
consider
it
the
door
was
still
as
he
had
left
it
partly
open
i
went
up
the
path
and
after
much
fumbling
found
the
knob
of
the
and
gave
it
a
sharp
pull
the
bell
answered
me
from
a
great
depth
and
distance
but
no
movement
followed
from
inside
the
house
and
although
i
pulled
the
bell
again
and
again
i
could
hear
nothing
save
the
dripping
of
the
mist
about
me
i
was
anxious
to
be
on
my
way
but
unless
i
knew
where
i
was
going
there
was
little
chance
of
my
making
any
speed
and
i
was
determined
that
until
i
learned
my
bearings
i
would
not
venture
back
into
the
fog
so
i
pushed
the
door
open
and
stepped
into
the
house
i
found
myself
in
a
long
and
narrow
hall
upon
which
doors
opened
from
either
side
at
the
end
of
the
hall
was
a
staircase
with
a
balustrade
which
ended
in
a
sweeping
curve
the
balustrade
was
covered
with
heavy
persian
rugs
and
the
walls
of
the
hall
were
also
hung
with
them
the
door
on
my
left
was
closed
but
the
one
nearer
me
on
the
right
was
open
and
as
i
stepped
opposite
to
it
i
saw
that
it
was
a
sort
of
reception
or
and
that
it
was
empty
the
door
below
it
was
also
open
and
with
the
idea
that
i
would
surely
find
some
one
there
i
walked
on
up
the
hall
i
was
in
evening
dress
and
i
felt
i
did
not
look
like
a
burglar
so
i
had
no
great
fear
that
should
i
encounter
one
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
he
would
shoot
me
on
sight
the
second
door
in
the
hall
opened
into
a
this
was
also
empty
one
person
had
been
dining
at
the
table
but
the
cloth
had
not
been
cleared
away
and
a
nickering
candle
showed
wineglasses
and
the
ashes
of
cigarettes
the
greater
part
of
the
room
was
in
complete
darkness
by
this
time
i
had
grown
conscious
of
the
fact
that
i
was
wandering
about
in
a
strange
house
and
that
apparently
i
was
alone
in
it
the
silence
of
the
place
began
to
try
my
nerves
and
in
a
sudden
unexplainable
panic
i
started
for
the
open
street
but
as
i
turned
i
saw
a
man
sitting
on
a
bench
which
the
curve
of
the
balustrade
had
hidden
from
me
his
eyes
were
shut
and
he
was
sleeping
soundly
the
moment
before
i
had
been
bewildered
because
i
could
see
no
one
but
at
sight
of
this
man
i
was
much
more
bewildered
he
was
a
very
large
man
a
giant
in
height
with
long
yellow
hair
which
hung
below
his
shoulders
he
was
dressed
in
a
red
silk
shirt
that
was
belted
at
the
waist
and
hung
outside
black
velvet
trousers
which
in
turn
were
stuffed
into
high
black
boots
i
recognized
the
costume
at
once
as
that
of
a
russian
servant
but
what
a
russian
servant
in
his
native
livery
could
be
doing
in
a
private
house
in
knightsbridge
was
incomprehensible
i
advanced
and
touched
the
man
on
the
shoulder
and
after
an
effort
he
awoke
and
on
seeing
me
sprang
to
his
feet
and
began
bowing
rapidly
and
making
deprecatory
gestures
i
had
picked
up
enough
russian
in
petersburg
to
make
out
that
the
man
was
apologizing
for
having
fallen
asleep
and
i
also
was
able
to
explain
to
him
that
i
desired
to
see
his
master
he
nodded
vigorously
and
said
will
the
excellency
come
this
way
the
princess
is
i
distinctly
made
out
the
word
princess
and
i
was
a
good
deal
embarrassed
i
had
thought
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
explain
my
intrusion
to
a
man
but
how
a
woman
would
look
at
it
was
another
matter
and
as
i
followed
him
down
the
hall
i
was
somewhat
puzzled
as
we
advanced
he
noticed
that
the
front
door
was
standing
open
and
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
hastened
toward
it
and
closed
it
then
he
rapped
twice
on
the
door
of
what
was
apparently
the
there
was
no
reply
to
his
knock
and
he
tapped
again
and
then
timidly
and
cringing
subserviently
opened
the
door
and
stepped
inside
he
withdrew
himself
at
once
and
stared
stupidly
at
me
shaking
his
head
she
is
not
there
he
said
he
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
blankly
through
the
open
door
and
then
hastened
toward
the
the
solitary
candle
which
still
burned
there
seemed
to
assure
him
that
the
room
also
was
empty
he
came
back
and
bowed
me
toward
the
she
is
above
he
said
i
will
inform
the
princess
of
the
excellency
s
before
i
could
stop
him
he
had
turned
and
was
running
up
the
staircase
leaving
me
alone
at
the
open
door
of
the
i
decided
that
the
adventure
had
gone
quite
far
enough
and
if
i
had
been
able
to
explain
to
the
russian
that
i
had
lost
my
way
in
the
fog
and
only
wanted
to
get
back
into
the
street
again
i
would
have
left
the
house
on
the
instant
of
course
when
i
first
rang
the
bell
of
the
house
i
had
no
other
expectation
than
that
it
would
be
answered
by
a
who
would
direct
me
on
my
way
i
certainly
could
not
then
foresee
that
i
would
disturb
a
russian
princess
in
her
boudoir
or
that
i
might
be
thrown
out
by
her
athletic
bodyguard
still
i
thought
i
ought
not
now
to
leave
the
house
without
making
some
apology
and
if
the
worst
should
come
i
could
show
my
card
they
could
hardly
believe
that
a
member
of
an
embassy
had
any
designs
upon
the
the
room
in
which
i
stood
was
dimly
lighted
but
i
could
see
that
like
the
hall
it
was
hung
with
heavy
persian
rugs
the
corners
were
filled
with
palms
and
there
was
the
unmistakable
odor
in
the
air
of
russian
cigarettes
and
strange
dry
scents
that
carried
me
back
to
the
bazaars
of
vladivostock
near
the
front
windows
was
a
grand
piano
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
a
heavily
carved
screen
of
some
black
wood
picked
out
with
ivory
the
screen
was
overhung
with
a
canopy
of
silken
draperies
and
formed
a
sort
of
alcove
in
front
of
the
alcove
was
spread
the
white
skin
of
a
polar
bear
and
set
on
that
was
one
of
those
low
turkish
coffee
tables
it
held
a
lighted
and
two
gold
coffee
cups
i
had
heard
no
movement
from
above
stairs
and
it
must
have
been
fully
three
minutes
that
i
stood
waiting
noting
these
details
of
the
room
and
wondering
at
the
delay
and
at
the
strange
silence
and
then
suddenly
as
my
eye
grew
more
used
to
the
i
saw
projecting
from
behind
the
screen
as
though
it
were
stretched
along
the
back
of
a
divan
the
hand
of
a
man
and
the
lower
part
of
his
arm
i
was
as
startled
as
though
i
had
come
across
a
footprint
on
a
deserted
island
evidently
the
man
had
been
sitting
there
since
i
had
come
into
the
room
even
since
i
had
entered
the
house
and
he
had
heard
the
servant
knocking
upon
the
door
why
he
had
not
declared
himself
i
could
not
understand
but
i
supposed
that
possibly
he
was
a
guest
with
no
reason
to
interest
himself
in
the
princess
s
other
visitors
or
perhaps
for
some
reason
he
did
not
wish
to
be
observed
i
could
see
nothing
of
him
except
his
hand
but
i
had
an
unpleasant
feeling
that
he
had
been
peering
at
me
through
the
carving
in
the
screen
and
that
he
still
was
doing
so
i
moved
my
feet
noisily
on
the
floor
and
said
tentatively
i
beg
your
there
was
no
reply
and
the
hand
did
not
stir
apparently
the
man
was
bent
upon
ignoring
me
but
as
all
i
wished
was
to
apologize
for
my
intrusion
and
to
leave
the
house
i
walked
up
to
the
alcove
and
peered
around
it
inside
the
screen
was
a
divan
piled
with
cushions
and
on
the
end
of
it
nearer
me
the
man
was
sitting
he
was
a
young
englishman
with
light
yellow
hair
and
a
deeply
bronzed
face
he
was
seated
with
his
arms
stretched
out
along
the
back
of
the
divan
and
with
his
head
resting
against
a
cushion
his
attitude
was
one
of
complete
ease
but
his
mouth
had
fallen
open
and
his
eyes
were
set
with
an
expression
of
utter
horror
at
the
first
glance
i
saw
that
he
was
quite
dead
for
a
flash
of
time
i
was
too
startled
to
act
but
in
the
same
flash
i
was
convinced
that
the
man
had
met
his
death
from
no
accident
that
he
had
not
died
through
any
ordinary
failure
of
the
laws
of
nature
the
expression
on
his
face
was
much
too
terrible
to
be
misinterpreted
it
spoke
as
eloquently
as
words
it
told
me
that
before
the
end
had
come
he
had
watched
his
death
approach
and
threaten
him
i
was
so
sure
he
had
been
murdered
that
i
instinctively
looked
on
the
floor
for
the
weapon
and
at
the
same
moment
out
of
concern
for
my
own
safety
quickly
behind
me
but
the
silence
of
the
house
continued
unbroken
i
have
seen
a
great
number
of
dead
men
i
was
on
the
asiatic
station
during
the
war
i
was
in
port
arthur
after
the
massacre
so
a
dead
man
for
the
single
reason
that
he
is
dead
does
not
repel
me
and
though
i
knew
that
there
was
no
hope
that
this
man
was
alive
still
for
decency
s
sake
i
felt
his
pulse
and
while
i
kept
my
ears
alert
for
any
sound
from
the
floors
above
me
i
pulled
open
his
shirt
and
placed
my
hand
upon
his
heart
my
fingers
instantly
touched
upon
the
opening
of
a
wound
and
as
i
withdrew
them
i
found
them
wet
with
blood
he
was
in
evening
dress
and
in
the
wide
bosom
of
his
shirt
i
found
a
narrow
slit
so
narrow
that
in
the
dim
light
it
was
scarcely
discernable
the
wound
was
no
wider
than
the
smallest
blade
of
a
but
when
i
stripped
the
shirt
away
from
the
chest
and
left
it
bare
i
found
that
the
weapon
narrow
as
it
was
had
been
long
enough
to
reach
his
heart
there
is
no
need
to
tell
you
how
i
felt
as
i
stood
by
the
body
of
this
boy
for
he
was
hardly
older
than
a
boy
or
of
the
thoughts
that
came
into
my
head
i
was
bitterly
sorry
for
this
stranger
bitterly
indignant
at
his
murderer
and
at
the
same
time
selfishly
concerned
for
my
own
safety
and
for
the
notoriety
which
i
saw
was
sure
to
follow
my
instinct
was
to
leave
the
body
where
it
lay
and
to
hide
myself
in
the
fog
but
i
also
felt
that
since
a
succession
of
accidents
had
made
me
the
only
witness
to
a
crime
my
duty
was
to
make
myself
a
good
witness
and
to
assist
to
establish
the
facts
of
this
murder
that
it
might
possibly
be
a
suicide
and
not
a
murder
did
not
disturb
me
for
a
moment
the
fact
that
the
weapon
had
disappeared
and
the
expression
on
the
boy
s
face
were
enough
to
convince
at
least
me
that
he
had
had
no
hand
in
his
own
death
i
judged
it
therefore
of
the
first
importance
to
discover
who
was
in
the
house
or
if
they
had
escaped
from
it
who
had
been
in
the
house
before
i
entered
it
i
had
seen
one
man
leave
it
but
all
i
could
tell
of
him
was
that
he
was
a
young
man
that
he
was
in
evening
dress
and
that
he
had
fled
in
such
haste
that
he
had
not
stopped
to
close
the
door
behind
him
the
russian
servant
i
had
found
apparently
asleep
and
unless
he
acted
a
part
with
supreme
skill
he
was
a
stupid
and
ignorant
boor
and
as
innocent
of
the
murder
as
myself
there
was
still
the
russian
princess
whom
he
had
expected
to
find
or
had
pretended
to
expect
to
find
in
the
same
room
with
the
murdered
man
i
judged
that
she
must
now
be
either
upstairs
with
the
servant
or
that
she
had
without
his
knowledge
already
fled
from
the
house
when
i
recalled
his
apparently
genuine
surprise
at
not
finding
her
in
the
this
latter
supposition
seemed
the
more
probable
nevertheless
i
decided
that
it
was
my
duty
to
make
a
search
and
after
a
second
hurried
look
for
the
weapon
among
the
cushions
of
the
divan
and
upon
the
floor
i
cautiously
crossed
the
hall
and
entered
the
the
single
candle
was
still
flickering
in
the
draught
and
showed
only
the
white
cloth
the
rest
of
the
room
was
draped
in
shadows
i
picked
up
the
candle
and
lifting
it
high
above
my
head
moved
around
the
corner
of
the
table
either
my
nerves
were
on
such
a
stretch
that
no
shock
could
strain
them
further
or
my
mind
was
inoculated
to
horrors
for
i
did
not
cry
out
at
what
i
saw
nor
retreat
from
it
immediately
at
my
feet
was
the
body
of
a
beautiful
woman
lying
at
full
length
upon
the
floor
her
arms
flung
out
on
either
side
of
her
and
her
white
face
and
shoulders
gleaming
dully
in
the
unsteady
light
of
the
candle
around
her
throat
was
a
great
chain
of
diamonds
and
the
light
played
upon
these
and
made
them
flash
and
blaze
in
tiny
flames
but
the
woman
who
wore
them
was
dead
and
i
was
so
certain
as
to
how
she
had
died
that
without
an
instant
s
hesitation
i
dropped
on
my
knees
beside
her
and
placed
my
hands
above
her
heart
my
fingers
again
touched
the
thin
slit
of
a
wound
i
had
no
doubt
in
my
mind
but
that
this
was
the
russian
princess
and
when
i
lowered
the
candle
to
her
face
i
was
assured
that
this
was
so
her
features
showed
the
finest
lines
of
both
the
slav
and
the
jewess
the
eyes
were
black
the
hair
and
wonderfully
heavy
and
her
skin
even
in
death
was
rich
in
color
she
was
a
surpassingly
beautiful
woman
illustration
at
my
feet
was
the
body
of
a
beautiful
woman
i
rose
and
tried
to
light
another
candle
with
the
one
i
held
but
i
found
that
my
hand
was
so
unsteady
that
i
could
not
keep
the
wicks
together
it
was
my
intention
to
again
search
for
this
strange
dagger
which
had
been
used
to
kill
both
the
english
boy
and
the
beautiful
princess
but
before
i
could
light
the
second
candle
i
heard
footsteps
descending
the
stairs
and
the
russian
servant
appeared
in
the
doorway
my
face
was
in
darkness
or
i
am
sure
that
at
the
sight
of
it
he
would
have
taken
alarm
for
at
that
moment
i
was
not
sure
but
that
this
man
himself
was
the
murderer
his
own
face
was
plainly
visible
to
me
in
the
light
from
the
hall
and
i
could
see
that
it
wore
an
expression
of
dull
bewilderment
i
stepped
quickly
toward
him
and
took
a
firm
hold
upon
his
wrist
she
is
not
there
he
said
the
princess
has
gone
they
have
all
who
have
gone
i
demanded
who
else
has
been
here
the
two
englishmen
he
said
what
two
englishmen
i
demanded
what
are
their
names
the
man
now
saw
by
my
manner
that
some
question
of
great
moment
hung
upon
his
answer
and
he
began
to
protest
that
he
did
not
know
the
names
of
the
visitors
and
that
until
that
evening
he
had
never
seen
them
i
guessed
that
it
was
my
tone
which
frightened
him
so
i
took
my
hand
off
his
wrist
and
spoke
less
eagerly
how
long
have
they
been
here
i
asked
and
when
did
they
go
he
pointed
behind
him
toward
the
one
sat
there
with
the
princess
he
said
the
other
came
after
i
had
placed
the
coffee
in
the
the
two
englishmen
talked
together
and
the
princess
returned
here
to
the
table
she
sat
there
in
that
chair
and
i
brought
her
cognac
and
cigarettes
then
i
sat
outside
upon
the
bench
it
was
a
feast
day
and
i
had
been
drinking
pardon
excellency
but
i
fell
asleep
when
i
woke
your
excellency
was
standing
by
me
but
the
princess
and
the
two
englishmen
had
gone
that
is
all
i
i
believed
that
the
man
was
telling
me
the
truth
his
fright
had
passed
and
he
was
now
apparently
puzzled
but
not
alarmed
you
must
remember
the
names
of
the
englishmen
i
urged
try
to
think
when
you
announced
them
to
the
princess
what
name
did
you
give
at
this
question
he
exclaimed
with
pleasure
and
beckoning
to
me
ran
hurriedly
down
the
hall
and
into
the
in
the
corner
furthest
from
the
screen
was
the
piano
and
on
it
was
a
silver
tray
he
picked
this
up
and
smiling
with
pride
at
his
own
intelligence
pointed
at
two
cards
that
lay
upon
it
i
took
them
up
and
read
the
names
engraved
upon
the
american
paused
abruptly
and
glanced
at
the
faces
about
him
i
read
the
names
he
repeated
he
spoke
with
great
reluctance
continue
cried
the
baronet
sharply
i
read
the
names
said
the
american
with
evident
distaste
and
the
family
name
of
each
was
the
same
they
were
the
names
of
two
brothers
one
is
well
known
to
you
it
is
that
of
the
african
explorer
of
whom
this
gentleman
was
just
speaking
i
mean
the
earl
of
chetney
the
other
was
the
name
of
his
brother
lord
arthur
the
men
at
the
table
fell
back
as
though
a
trapdoor
had
fallen
open
at
their
feet
lord
chetney
they
exclaimed
in
chorus
they
glanced
at
each
other
and
back
to
the
american
with
every
expression
of
concern
and
disbelief
it
is
impossible
cried
the
baronet
why
my
dear
sir
young
chetney
only
arrived
from
africa
yesterday
it
was
so
stated
in
the
evening
the
jaw
of
the
american
set
in
a
resolute
square
and
he
pressed
his
lips
together
you
are
perfectly
right
sir
he
said
lord
chetney
did
arrive
in
london
yesterday
morning
and
yesterday
night
i
found
his
dead
the
youngest
member
present
was
the
first
to
recover
he
seemed
much
less
concerned
over
the
identity
of
the
murdered
man
than
at
the
interruption
of
the
narrative
oh
please
let
him
go
on
he
cried
what
happened
then
you
say
you
found
two
visiting
cards
how
do
you
know
which
card
was
that
of
the
murdered
man
the
american
before
he
answered
waited
until
the
chorus
of
exclamations
had
ceased
then
he
continued
as
though
he
had
not
been
interrupted
the
instant
i
read
the
names
upon
the
cards
he
said
i
ran
to
the
screen
and
kneeling
beside
the
dead
man
began
a
search
through
his
pockets
my
hand
at
once
fell
upon
a
and
i
found
on
all
the
cards
it
contained
the
title
of
the
earl
of
chetney
his
watch
and
also
bore
his
name
these
evidences
and
the
fact
of
his
bronzed
skin
and
that
his
cheekbones
were
worn
with
fever
convinced
me
that
the
dead
man
was
the
african
explorer
and
the
boy
who
had
fled
past
me
in
the
night
was
arthur
his
younger
brother
i
was
so
intent
upon
my
search
that
i
had
forgotten
the
servant
and
i
was
still
on
my
knees
when
i
heard
a
cry
behind
me
i
turned
and
saw
the
man
gazing
down
at
the
body
in
abject
horror
before
i
could
rise
he
gave
another
cry
of
terror
and
flinging
himself
into
the
hall
raced
toward
the
door
to
the
street
i
leaped
after
him
shouting
to
him
to
halt
but
before
i
could
reach
the
hall
he
had
torn
open
the
door
and
i
saw
him
spring
out
into
the
yellow
fog
i
cleared
the
steps
in
a
jump
and
ran
down
the
garden
walk
but
just
as
the
gate
clicked
in
front
of
me
i
had
it
open
on
the
instant
and
following
the
sound
of
the
man
s
footsteps
i
raced
after
him
across
the
open
street
he
also
could
hear
me
and
he
instantly
stopped
running
and
there
was
absolute
silence
he
was
so
near
that
i
almost
fancied
i
could
hear
him
panting
and
i
held
my
own
breath
to
listen
but
i
could
distinguish
nothing
but
the
dripping
of
the
mist
about
us
and
from
far
off
the
music
of
the
hungarian
band
which
i
had
heard
when
i
first
lost
myself
all
i
could
see
was
the
square
of
light
from
the
door
i
had
left
open
behind
me
and
a
lamp
in
the
hall
beyond
it
flickering
in
the
draught
but
even
as
i
watched
it
the
flame
of
the
lamp
was
blown
violently
to
and
fro
and
the
door
caught
in
the
same
current
of
air
closed
slowly
i
knew
if
it
shut
i
could
not
again
enter
the
house
and
i
rushed
madly
toward
it
i
believe
i
even
shouted
out
as
though
it
were
something
human
which
i
could
compel
to
obey
me
and
then
i
caught
my
foot
against
the
curb
and
smashed
into
the
sidewalk
when
i
rose
to
my
feet
i
was
dizzy
and
half
stunned
and
though
i
thought
then
that
i
was
moving
toward
the
door
i
know
now
that
i
probably
turned
directly
from
it
for
as
i
groped
about
in
the
night
calling
frantically
for
the
police
my
fingers
touched
nothing
but
the
dripping
fog
and
the
iron
railings
for
which
i
sought
seemed
to
have
melted
away
for
many
minutes
i
beat
the
mist
with
my
arms
like
one
at
blind
man
s
buff
turning
sharply
in
circles
cursing
aloud
at
my
stupidity
and
crying
continually
for
help
at
last
a
voice
answered
me
from
the
fog
and
i
found
myself
held
in
the
circle
of
a
policeman
s
lantern
that
is
the
end
of
my
adventure
what
i
have
to
tell
you
now
is
what
i
learned
from
the
police
at
the
to
which
the
man
guided
me
i
related
what
you
have
just
heard
i
told
them
that
the
house
they
must
at
once
find
was
one
set
back
from
the
street
within
a
radius
of
two
hundred
yards
from
the
knightsbridge
barracks
that
within
fifty
yards
of
it
some
one
was
giving
a
dance
to
the
music
of
a
hungarian
band
and
that
the
railings
before
it
were
as
high
as
a
man
s
waist
and
filed
to
a
point
with
that
to
work
upon
twenty
men
were
at
once
ordered
out
into
the
fog
to
search
for
the
house
and
inspector
lyle
himself
was
despatched
to
the
home
of
lord
edam
chetney
s
father
with
a
warrant
for
lord
arthur
s
arrest
i
was
thanked
and
dismissed
on
my
own
recognizance
this
morning
inspector
lyle
called
on
me
and
from
him
i
learned
the
police
theory
of
the
scene
i
have
just
described
apparently
i
had
wandered
very
far
in
the
fog
for
up
to
noon
the
house
had
not
been
found
nor
had
they
been
able
to
arrest
lord
arthur
he
did
not
return
to
his
father
s
house
last
night
and
there
is
no
trace
of
him
but
from
what
the
police
knew
of
the
past
lives
of
the
people
i
found
in
that
lost
house
they
have
evolved
a
theory
and
their
theory
is
that
the
murders
were
committed
by
lord
arthur
the
infatuation
of
his
elder
brother
lord
chetney
for
a
russian
princess
so
inspector
lyle
tells
me
is
well
known
to
every
one
about
two
years
ago
the
princess
zichy
as
she
calls
herself
and
he
were
constantly
together
and
chetney
informed
his
friends
that
they
were
about
to
be
married
the
woman
was
notorious
in
two
continents
and
when
lord
edam
heard
of
his
son
s
infatuation
he
appealed
to
the
police
for
her
record
it
is
through
his
having
applied
to
them
that
they
know
so
much
concerning
her
and
her
relations
with
the
chetneys
from
the
police
lord
edam
learned
that
madame
zichy
had
once
been
a
spy
in
the
employ
of
the
russian
third
section
but
that
lately
she
had
been
repudiated
by
her
own
government
and
was
living
by
her
wits
by
blackmail
and
by
her
beauty
lord
edam
laid
this
record
before
his
son
but
chetney
either
knew
it
already
or
the
woman
persuaded
him
not
to
believe
in
it
and
the
father
and
son
parted
in
great
anger
two
days
later
the
marquis
altered
his
will
leaving
all
of
his
money
to
the
younger
brother
arthur
the
title
and
some
of
the
landed
property
he
could
not
keep
from
chetney
but
he
swore
if
his
son
saw
the
woman
again
that
the
will
should
stand
as
it
was
and
he
would
be
left
without
a
penny
this
was
about
eighteen
months
ago
when
apparently
chetney
tired
of
the
princess
and
suddenly
went
off
to
shoot
and
explore
in
central
africa
no
word
came
from
him
except
that
twice
he
was
reported
as
having
died
of
fever
in
the
jungle
and
finally
two
traders
reached
the
coast
who
said
they
had
seen
his
body
this
was
accepted
by
all
as
conclusive
and
young
arthur
was
recognized
as
the
heir
to
the
edam
millions
on
the
strength
of
this
supposition
he
at
once
began
to
borrow
enormous
sums
from
the
money
lenders
this
is
of
great
importance
as
the
police
believe
it
was
these
debts
which
drove
him
to
the
murder
of
his
brother
yesterday
as
you
know
lord
chetney
suddenly
returned
from
the
grave
and
it
was
the
fact
that
for
two
years
he
had
been
considered
as
dead
which
lent
such
importance
to
his
return
and
which
gave
rise
to
those
columns
of
detail
concerning
him
which
appeared
in
all
the
afternoon
papers
but
obviously
during
his
absence
he
had
not
tired
of
the
princess
zichy
for
we
know
that
a
few
hours
after
he
reached
london
he
sought
her
out
his
brother
who
had
also
learned
of
his
reappearance
through
the
papers
probably
suspected
which
would
be
the
house
he
would
first
visit
and
followed
him
there
arriving
so
the
russian
servant
tells
us
while
the
two
were
at
coffee
in
the
the
princess
then
we
also
learn
from
the
servant
withdrew
to
the
leaving
the
brothers
together
what
happened
one
can
only
guess
lord
arthur
knew
now
that
when
it
was
discovered
he
was
no
longer
the
heir
the
would
come
down
upon
him
the
police
believe
that
he
at
once
sought
out
his
brother
to
beg
for
money
to
cover
the
but
that
considering
the
sum
he
needed
was
several
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
chetney
refused
to
give
it
him
no
one
knew
that
arthur
had
gone
to
seek
out
his
brother
they
were
alone
it
is
possible
then
that
in
a
passion
of
disappointment
and
crazed
with
the
disgrace
which
he
saw
before
him
young
arthur
made
himself
the
heir
beyond
further
question
the
death
of
his
brother
would
have
availed
nothing
if
the
woman
remained
alive
it
is
then
possible
that
he
crossed
the
hall
and
with
the
same
weapon
which
made
him
lord
edam
s
heir
destroyed
the
solitary
witness
to
the
murder
the
only
other
person
who
could
have
seen
it
was
sleeping
in
a
drunken
stupor
to
which
fact
undoubtedly
he
owed
his
life
and
yet
concluded
the
naval
attache
leaning
forward
and
marking
each
word
with
his
finger
lord
arthur
blundered
fatally
in
his
haste
he
left
the
door
of
the
house
open
so
giving
access
to
the
first
and
he
forgot
that
when
he
entered
it
he
had
handed
his
card
to
the
servant
that
piece
of
paper
may
yet
send
him
to
the
gallows
in
the
mean
time
he
has
disappeared
completely
and
somewhere
in
one
of
the
millions
of
streets
of
this
great
capital
in
a
locked
and
empty
house
lies
the
body
of
his
brother
and
of
the
woman
his
brother
loved
undiscovered
unburied
and
with
their
murder
in
the
discussion
which
followed
the
conclusion
of
the
story
of
the
naval
attache
the
gentleman
with
the
pearl
took
no
part
instead
he
arose
and
beckoning
a
servant
to
a
far
corner
of
the
room
whispered
earnestly
to
him
until
a
sudden
movement
on
the
part
of
sir
andrew
caused
him
to
return
hurriedly
to
the
table
there
are
several
points
in
sears
s
story
i
want
explained
he
cried
be
seated
sir
andrew
he
begged
let
us
have
the
opinion
of
an
expert
i
do
not
care
what
the
police
think
i
want
to
know
what
you
but
sir
henry
rose
reluctantly
from
his
chair
i
should
like
nothing
better
than
to
discuss
this
he
said
but
it
is
most
important
that
i
proceed
to
the
house
i
should
have
been
there
some
time
he
turned
toward
the
servant
and
directed
him
to
call
a
hansom
the
gentleman
with
the
pearl
stud
looked
appealingly
at
the
naval
attache
there
are
surely
many
details
that
you
have
not
told
us
he
urged
some
you
have
the
baronet
interrupted
quickly
i
trust
not
he
said
for
i
could
not
possibly
stop
to
hear
the
story
is
finished
declared
the
naval
attache
until
lord
arthur
is
arrested
or
the
bodies
are
found
there
is
nothing
more
to
tell
of
either
chetney
or
the
princess
of
lord
chetney
perhaps
not
interrupted
the
gentleman
with
the
black
tie
but
there
ll
always
be
something
to
tell
of
the
princess
zichy
i
know
enough
stories
about
her
to
fill
a
book
she
was
a
most
remarkable
the
speaker
dropped
the
end
of
his
cigar
into
his
coffee
cup
and
taking
his
case
from
his
pocket
selected
a
fresh
one
as
he
did
so
he
laughed
and
held
up
the
case
that
the
others
might
see
it
it
was
an
ordinary
of
with
a
silver
clasp
the
only
time
i
ever
met
her
he
said
she
tried
to
rob
me
of
the
baronet
regarded
him
closely
she
tried
to
rob
you
he
repeated
illustration
the
princess
zichy
tried
to
rob
me
of
this
continued
the
gentleman
in
the
black
tie
and
of
the
czarina
s
his
tone
was
one
of
mingled
admiration
and
injury
the
czarina
s
diamonds
exclaimed
the
baronet
he
glanced
quickly
and
suspiciously
at
the
speaker
and
then
at
the
others
about
the
table
but
their
faces
gave
evidence
of
no
other
emotion
than
that
of
ordinary
interest
yes
the
czarina
s
diamonds
repeated
the
man
with
the
black
tie
it
was
a
necklace
of
diamonds
i
was
told
to
take
them
to
the
russian
ambassador
in
paris
who
was
to
deliver
them
at
moscow
i
am
a
queen
s
messenger
he
added
oh
i
see
exclaimed
sir
andrew
in
a
tone
of
relief
and
you
say
that
this
same
princess
zichy
one
of
the
victims
of
this
double
murder
endeavored
to
rob
you
of
of
that
and
the
czarina
s
diamonds
answered
the
queen
s
messenger
imperturbably
it
s
not
much
of
a
story
but
it
gives
you
an
idea
of
the
woman
s
character
the
robbery
took
place
between
paris
and
the
baronet
interrupted
him
with
an
abrupt
movement
no
no
he
cried
shaking
his
head
in
protest
do
not
tempt
me
i
really
can
not
listen
i
must
be
at
the
house
in
ten
i
am
sorry
said
the
queen
s
messenger
he
turned
to
those
seated
about
him
i
wonder
if
the
other
gentlemen
he
inquired
tentatively
there
was
a
chorus
of
polite
murmurs
and
the
queen
s
messenger
bowing
his
head
in
acknowledgment
took
a
preparatory
sip
from
his
glass
at
the
same
moment
the
servant
to
whom
the
man
with
the
black
pearl
had
spoken
slipped
a
piece
of
paper
into
his
hand
he
glanced
at
it
frowned
and
threw
it
under
the
table
the
servant
bowed
to
the
baronet
your
hansom
is
waiting
sir
andrew
he
said
the
necklace
was
worth
twenty
thousand
pounds
began
the
queen
s
messenger
it
was
a
present
from
the
queen
of
england
to
celebrate
the
baronet
gave
an
exclamation
of
angry
annoyance
upon
my
word
this
is
most
provoking
he
interrupted
i
really
ought
not
to
stay
but
i
certainly
mean
to
hear
he
turned
irritably
to
the
servant
tell
the
hansom
to
wait
he
commanded
and
with
an
air
of
a
boy
who
is
playing
truant
slipped
guiltily
into
his
chair
the
gentleman
with
the
black
pearl
smiled
blandly
and
rapped
upon
the
table
order
gentlemen
he
said
order
for
the
story
of
the
queen
s
messenger
and
the
czarina
s
chapter
ii
the
necklace
was
a
present
from
the
queen
of
england
to
the
czarina
of
russia
began
the
queen
s
messenger
it
was
to
celebrate
the
occasion
of
the
czar
s
coronation
our
foreign
office
knew
that
the
russian
ambassador
in
paris
was
to
proceed
to
moscow
for
that
ceremony
and
i
was
directed
to
go
to
paris
and
turn
over
the
necklace
to
him
but
when
i
reached
paris
i
found
he
had
not
expected
me
for
a
week
later
and
was
taking
a
few
days
vacation
at
nice
his
people
asked
me
to
leave
the
necklace
with
them
at
the
embassy
but
i
had
been
charged
to
get
a
receipt
for
it
from
the
ambassador
himself
so
i
started
at
once
for
nice
the
fact
that
monte
carlo
is
not
two
thousand
miles
from
nice
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
making
me
carry
out
my
instructions
so
carefully
now
how
the
princess
zichy
came
to
find
out
about
the
necklace
i
don
t
know
but
i
can
guess
as
you
have
just
heard
she
was
at
one
time
a
spy
in
the
service
of
the
russian
government
and
after
they
dismissed
her
she
kept
up
her
acquaintance
with
many
of
the
russian
agents
in
london
it
is
probable
that
through
one
of
them
she
learned
that
the
necklace
was
to
be
sent
to
moscow
and
which
one
of
the
queen
s
messengers
had
been
detailed
to
take
it
there
still
i
doubt
if
even
that
knowledge
would
have
helped
her
if
she
had
not
also
known
something
which
i
supposed
no
one
else
in
the
world
knew
but
myself
and
one
other
man
and
curiously
enough
the
other
man
was
a
queen
s
messenger
too
and
a
friend
of
mine
you
must
know
that
up
to
the
time
of
this
robbery
i
had
always
concealed
my
despatches
in
a
manner
peculiarly
my
own
i
got
the
idea
from
that
play
called
a
scrap
of
in
it
a
man
wants
to
hide
a
certain
compromising
document
he
knows
that
all
his
rooms
will
be
secretly
searched
for
it
so
he
puts
it
in
a
torn
envelope
and
sticks
it
up
where
any
one
can
see
it
on
his
mantel
shelf
the
result
is
that
the
woman
who
is
ransacking
the
house
to
find
it
looks
in
all
the
unlikely
places
but
passes
over
the
scrap
of
paper
that
is
just
under
her
nose
sometimes
the
papers
and
packages
they
give
us
to
carry
about
europe
are
of
very
great
value
and
sometimes
they
are
special
makes
of
cigarettes
and
orders
to
court
dressmakers
sometimes
we
know
what
we
are
carrying
and
sometimes
we
do
not
if
it
is
a
large
sum
of
money
or
a
treaty
they
generally
tell
us
but
as
a
rule
we
have
no
knowledge
of
what
the
package
contains
so
to
be
on
the
safe
side
we
naturally
take
just
as
great
care
of
it
as
though
we
knew
it
held
the
terms
of
an
ultimatum
or
the
crown
jewels
as
a
rule
my
confreres
carry
the
official
packages
in
a
which
is
just
as
obvious
as
a
lady
s
jewel
bag
in
the
hands
of
her
maid
every
one
knows
they
are
carrying
something
of
value
they
put
a
premium
on
dishonesty
well
after
i
saw
the
scrap
of
paper
play
i
determined
to
put
the
government
valuables
in
the
most
unlikely
place
that
any
one
would
look
for
them
so
i
used
to
hide
the
documents
they
gave
me
inside
my
and
small
articles
such
as
money
or
jewels
i
carried
in
an
old
after
i
took
to
using
my
case
for
that
purpose
i
bought
a
new
one
exactly
like
it
for
my
cigars
but
to
avoid
mistakes
i
had
my
initials
placed
on
both
sides
of
the
new
one
and
the
moment
i
touched
the
case
even
in
the
dark
i
could
tell
which
it
was
by
the
raised
initials
no
one
knew
of
this
except
the
queen
s
messenger
of
whom
i
spoke
we
once
left
paris
together
on
the
orient
express
i
was
going
to
constantinople
and
he
was
to
stop
off
at
vienna
on
the
journey
i
told
him
of
my
peculiar
way
of
hiding
things
and
showed
him
my
if
i
recollect
rightly
on
that
trip
it
held
the
grand
cross
of
michael
and
george
which
the
queen
was
sending
to
our
ambassador
the
messenger
was
very
much
entertained
at
my
scheme
and
some
months
later
when
he
met
the
princess
he
told
her
about
it
as
an
amusing
story
of
course
he
had
no
idea
she
was
a
russian
spy
he
didn
t
know
anything
at
all
about
her
except
that
she
was
a
very
attractive
woman
it
was
indiscreet
but
he
could
not
possibly
have
guessed
that
she
could
ever
make
any
use
of
what
he
told
her
later
after
the
robbery
i
remembered
that
i
had
informed
this
young
chap
of
my
secret
and
when
i
saw
him
again
i
questioned
him
about
it
he
was
greatly
distressed
and
said
he
had
never
seen
the
importance
of
the
secret
he
remembered
he
had
told
several
people
of
it
and
among
others
the
princess
zichy
in
that
way
i
found
out
that
it
was
she
who
had
robbed
me
and
i
know
that
from
the
moment
i
left
london
she
was
following
me
and
that
she
knew
then
that
the
diamonds
were
concealed
in
my
my
train
for
nice
left
paris
at
ten
in
the
morning
when
i
travel
at
night
i
generally
tell
the
de
that
i
am
a
queen
s
messenger
and
he
gives
me
a
compartment
to
myself
but
in
the
daytime
i
take
whatever
offers
on
this
morning
i
had
found
an
empty
compartment
and
i
had
tipped
the
guard
to
keep
every
one
else
out
not
from
any
fear
of
losing
the
diamonds
but
because
i
wanted
to
smoke
he
had
locked
the
door
and
as
the
last
bell
had
rung
i
supposed
i
was
to
travel
alone
so
i
began
to
arrange
my
traps
and
make
myself
comfortable
the
diamonds
in
the
were
in
the
inside
pocket
of
my
waistcoat
and
as
they
made
a
bulky
package
i
took
them
out
intending
to
put
them
in
my
hand
bag
it
is
a
small
satchel
like
a
bookmaker
s
or
those
hand
bags
that
couriers
carry
i
wear
it
slung
from
a
strap
across
my
shoulder
and
no
matter
whether
i
am
sitting
or
walking
it
never
leaves
me
i
took
the
which
held
the
necklace
from
my
inside
pocket
and
the
case
which
held
the
cigars
out
of
the
satchel
and
while
i
was
searching
through
it
for
a
box
of
matches
i
laid
the
two
cases
beside
me
on
the
seat
at
that
moment
the
train
started
but
at
the
same
instant
there
was
a
rattle
at
the
lock
of
the
compartment
and
a
couple
of
porters
lifted
and
shoved
a
woman
through
the
door
and
hurled
her
rugs
and
umbrellas
in
after
her
instinctively
i
reached
for
the
diamonds
i
shoved
them
quickly
into
the
satchel
and
pushing
them
far
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
bag
snapped
the
spring
lock
then
i
put
the
cigars
in
the
pocket
of
my
coat
but
with
the
thought
that
now
that
i
had
a
woman
as
a
travelling
companion
i
would
probably
not
be
allowed
to
enjoy
them
one
of
her
pieces
of
luggage
had
fallen
at
my
feet
and
a
roll
of
rugs
had
landed
at
my
side
i
thought
if
i
hid
the
fact
that
the
lady
was
not
welcome
and
at
once
endeavored
to
be
civil
she
might
permit
me
to
smoke
so
i
picked
her
hand
bag
off
the
floor
and
asked
her
where
i
might
place
it
as
i
spoke
i
looked
at
her
for
the
first
time
and
saw
that
she
was
a
most
remarkably
handsome
woman
she
smiled
charmingly
and
begged
me
not
to
disturb
myself
then
she
arranged
her
own
things
about
her
and
opening
her
took
out
a
gold
cigarette
case
do
you
object
to
smoke
she
asked
i
laughed
and
assured
her
i
had
been
in
great
terror
lest
she
might
object
to
it
herself
if
you
like
cigarettes
she
said
will
you
try
some
of
these
they
are
rolled
especially
for
my
husband
in
russia
and
they
are
supposed
to
be
very
i
thanked
her
and
took
one
from
her
case
and
i
found
it
so
much
better
than
my
own
that
i
continued
to
smoke
her
cigarettes
throughout
the
rest
of
the
journey
i
must
say
that
we
got
on
very
well
i
judged
from
the
coronet
on
her
and
from
her
manner
which
was
quite
as
well
bred
as
that
of
any
woman
i
ever
met
that
she
was
some
one
of
importance
and
though
she
seemed
almost
too
good
looking
to
be
respectable
i
determined
that
she
was
some
who
was
so
assured
of
her
position
that
she
could
afford
to
be
unconventional
at
first
she
read
her
novel
and
then
she
made
some
comment
on
the
scenery
and
finally
we
began
to
discuss
the
current
politics
of
the
continent
she
talked
of
all
the
cities
in
europe
and
seemed
to
know
every
one
worth
knowing
but
she
volunteered
nothing
about
herself
except
that
she
frequently
made
use
of
the
expression
when
my
husband
was
stationed
at
vienna
or
when
my
husband
was
promoted
to
once
she
said
to
me
i
have
often
seen
you
at
monte
carlo
i
saw
you
when
you
won
the
pigeon
i
told
her
that
i
was
not
a
pigeon
shot
and
she
gave
a
little
start
of
surprise
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
i
thought
you
were
morton
hamilton
the
english
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
look
like
hamilton
but
i
know
now
that
her
object
was
to
make
me
think
that
she
had
no
idea
as
to
who
i
really
was
she
needn
t
have
acted
at
all
for
i
certainly
had
no
suspicions
of
her
and
was
only
too
pleased
to
have
so
charming
a
companion
the
one
thing
that
should
have
made
me
suspicious
was
the
fact
that
at
every
station
she
made
some
trivial
excuse
to
get
me
out
of
the
compartment
she
pretended
that
her
maid
was
travelling
back
of
us
in
one
of
the
carriages
and
kept
saying
she
could
not
imagine
why
the
woman
did
not
come
to
look
after
her
and
if
the
maid
did
not
turn
up
at
the
next
stop
would
i
be
so
very
kind
as
to
get
out
and
bring
her
whatever
it
was
she
pretended
she
wanted
i
had
taken
my
from
the
rack
to
get
out
a
novel
and
had
left
it
on
the
seat
opposite
to
mine
and
at
the
end
of
the
compartment
farthest
from
her
and
once
when
i
came
back
from
buying
her
a
cup
of
chocolate
or
from
some
other
fool
errand
i
found
her
standing
at
my
end
of
the
compartment
with
both
hands
on
the
she
looked
at
me
without
so
much
as
winking
an
eye
and
shoved
the
case
carefully
into
a
corner
your
bag
slipped
off
on
the
floor
she
said
if
you
ve
got
any
bottles
in
it
you
had
better
look
and
see
that
they
re
not
and
i
give
you
my
word
i
was
such
an
ass
that
i
did
open
the
case
and
looked
all
through
it
she
must
have
thought
i
a
juggins
i
get
hot
all
over
whenever
i
remember
it
but
in
spite
of
my
dulness
and
her
cleverness
she
couldn
t
gain
anything
by
sending
me
away
because
what
she
wanted
was
in
the
hand
bag
and
every
time
she
sent
me
away
the
hand
bag
went
with
me
after
the
incident
of
the
her
manner
changed
either
in
my
absence
she
had
had
time
to
look
through
it
or
when
i
was
examining
it
for
broken
bottles
she
had
seen
everything
it
held
from
that
moment
she
must
have
been
certain
that
the
in
which
she
knew
i
carried
the
diamonds
was
in
the
bag
that
was
fastened
to
my
body
and
from
that
time
on
she
probably
was
plotting
how
to
get
it
from
me
her
anxiety
became
most
apparent
she
dropped
the
great
lady
manner
and
her
charming
condescension
went
with
it
she
ceased
talking
and
when
i
spoke
answered
me
irritably
or
at
random
no
doubt
her
mind
was
entirely
occupied
with
her
plan
the
end
of
our
journey
was
drawing
rapidly
nearer
and
her
time
for
action
was
being
cut
down
with
the
speed
of
the
express
train
even
i
unsuspicious
as
i
was
noticed
that
something
was
very
wrong
with
her
i
really
believe
that
before
we
reached
marseilles
if
i
had
not
through
my
own
stupidity
given
her
the
chance
she
wanted
she
might
have
stuck
a
knife
in
me
and
rolled
me
out
on
the
rails
but
as
it
was
i
only
thought
that
the
long
journey
had
tired
her
i
suggested
that
it
was
a
very
trying
trip
and
asked
her
if
she
would
allow
me
to
offer
her
some
of
my
cognac
she
thanked
me
and
said
no
and
then
suddenly
her
eyes
lighted
and
she
exclaimed
yes
thank
you
if
you
will
be
so
my
flask
was
in
the
hand
bag
and
i
placed
it
on
my
lap
and
with
my
thumb
slipped
back
the
catch
as
i
keep
my
tickets
and
railroad
guide
in
the
bag
i
am
so
constantly
opening
it
that
i
never
bother
to
lock
it
and
the
fact
that
it
is
strapped
to
me
has
always
been
sufficient
protection
but
i
can
appreciate
now
what
a
satisfaction
and
what
a
torment
too
it
must
have
been
to
that
woman
when
she
saw
that
the
bag
opened
without
a
key
while
we
were
crossing
the
mountains
i
had
felt
rather
chilly
and
had
been
wearing
a
light
racing
coat
but
after
the
lamps
were
lighted
the
compartment
became
very
hot
and
stuffy
and
i
found
the
coat
uncomfortable
so
i
stood
up
and
after
first
slipping
the
strap
of
the
bag
over
my
head
i
placed
the
bag
in
the
seat
next
me
and
pulled
off
the
racing
coat
i
don
t
blame
myself
for
being
careless
the
bag
was
still
within
reach
of
my
hand
and
nothing
would
have
happened
if
at
that
exact
moment
the
train
had
not
stopped
at
arles
it
was
the
combination
of
my
removing
the
bag
and
our
entering
the
station
at
the
same
instant
which
gave
the
princess
zichy
the
chance
she
wanted
to
rob
me
i
needn
t
say
that
she
was
clever
enough
to
take
it
the
train
ran
into
the
station
at
full
speed
and
came
to
a
sudden
stop
i
had
just
thrown
my
coat
into
the
rack
and
had
reached
out
my
hand
for
the
bag
in
another
instant
i
would
have
had
the
strap
around
my
shoulder
but
at
that
moment
the
princess
threw
open
the
door
of
the
compartment
and
beckoned
wildly
at
the
people
on
the
platform
natalie
she
called
natalie
here
i
am
come
here
this
way
she
turned
upon
me
in
the
greatest
excitement
my
maid
she
cried
she
is
looking
for
me
she
passed
the
window
without
seeing
me
go
please
and
bring
her
she
continued
pointing
out
of
the
door
and
beckoning
me
with
her
other
hand
there
certainly
was
something
about
that
woman
s
tone
which
made
one
jump
when
she
was
giving
orders
you
had
no
chance
to
think
of
anything
else
so
i
rushed
out
on
my
errand
of
mercy
and
then
rushed
back
again
to
ask
what
the
maid
looked
like
illustration
this
gave
the
princess
zichy
the
chance
in
black
she
answered
rising
and
blocking
the
door
of
the
compartment
all
in
black
with
a
bonnet
the
train
waited
three
minutes
at
aries
and
in
that
time
i
suppose
i
must
have
rushed
up
to
over
twenty
women
and
asked
are
you
natalie
the
only
reason
i
wasn
t
punched
with
an
umbrella
or
handed
over
to
the
police
was
that
they
probably
thought
i
was
crazy
when
i
jumped
back
into
the
compartment
the
princess
was
seated
where
i
had
left
her
but
her
eyes
were
burning
with
happiness
she
placed
her
hand
on
my
arm
almost
affectionately
and
said
in
a
hysterical
way
you
are
very
kind
to
me
i
am
so
sorry
to
have
troubled
i
protested
that
every
woman
on
the
platform
was
dressed
in
black
indeed
i
am
so
sorry
she
said
laughing
and
she
continued
to
laugh
until
she
began
to
breathe
so
quickly
that
i
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
i
can
see
now
that
the
last
part
of
that
journey
must
have
been
a
terrible
half
hour
for
her
she
had
the
safe
enough
but
she
knew
that
she
herself
was
not
safe
she
understood
if
i
were
to
open
my
bag
even
at
the
last
minute
and
miss
the
case
i
would
know
positively
that
she
had
taken
it
i
had
placed
the
diamonds
in
the
bag
at
the
very
moment
she
entered
the
compartment
and
no
one
but
our
two
selves
had
occupied
it
since
she
knew
that
when
we
reached
marseilles
she
would
either
be
twenty
thousand
pounds
richer
than
when
she
left
paris
or
that
she
would
go
to
jail
that
was
the
situation
as
she
must
have
read
it
and
i
don
t
envy
her
her
state
of
mind
during
that
last
half
hour
it
must
have
been
hell
illustration
she
knew
she
would
be
twenty
thousand
pounds
richer
i
saw
that
something
was
wrong
and
in
my
innocence
i
even
wondered
if
possibly
my
cognac
had
not
been
a
little
too
strong
for
she
suddenly
developed
into
a
most
brilliant
conversationalist
and
applauded
and
laughed
at
everything
i
said
and
fired
off
questions
at
me
like
a
machine
gun
so
that
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
anything
but
of
what
she
was
saying
whenever
i
stirred
she
stopped
her
chattering
and
leaned
toward
me
and
watched
me
like
a
cat
over
a
i
wondered
how
i
could
have
considered
her
an
agreeable
travelling
companion
i
thought
i
would
have
preferred
to
be
locked
in
with
a
lunatic
i
don
t
like
to
think
how
she
would
have
acted
if
i
had
made
a
move
to
examine
the
bag
but
as
i
had
it
safely
strapped
around
me
again
i
did
not
open
it
and
i
reached
marseilles
alive
as
we
drew
into
the
station
she
shook
hands
with
me
and
grinned
at
me
like
a
cheshire
cat
i
can
not
tell
you
she
said
how
much
i
have
to
thank
you
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
impudence
i
offered
to
put
her
in
a
carriage
but
she
said
she
must
find
natalie
and
that
she
hoped
we
would
meet
again
at
the
hotel
so
i
drove
off
by
myself
wondering
who
she
was
and
whether
natalie
was
not
her
keeper
i
had
to
wait
several
hours
for
the
train
to
nice
and
as
i
wanted
to
stroll
around
the
city
i
thought
i
had
better
put
the
diamonds
in
the
safe
of
the
hotel
as
soon
as
i
reached
my
room
i
locked
the
door
placed
the
hand
bag
on
the
table
and
opened
it
i
felt
among
the
things
at
the
top
of
it
but
failed
to
touch
the
i
shoved
my
hand
in
deeper
and
stirred
the
things
about
but
still
i
did
not
reach
it
a
cold
wave
swept
down
my
spine
and
a
sort
of
emptiness
came
to
the
pit
of
my
stomach
then
i
turned
and
the
sweat
sprung
out
all
over
me
i
wet
my
lips
with
my
tongue
and
said
to
myself
don
t
be
an
ass
pull
yourself
together
pull
yourself
together
take
the
things
out
one
at
a
time
it
s
there
of
course
it
s
there
don
t
be
an
so
i
put
a
brake
on
my
nerves
and
began
very
carefully
to
pick
out
the
things
one
by
one
but
after
another
second
i
could
not
stand
it
and
i
rushed
across
the
room
and
threw
out
everything
on
the
bed
but
the
diamonds
were
not
among
them
i
pulled
the
things
about
and
tore
them
open
and
shuffled
and
rearranged
and
sorted
them
but
it
was
no
use
the
was
gone
i
threw
everything
in
the
out
on
the
floor
although
i
knew
it
was
useless
to
look
for
it
there
i
knew
that
i
had
put
it
in
the
bag
i
sat
down
and
tried
to
think
i
remembered
i
had
put
it
in
the
satchel
at
paris
just
as
that
woman
had
entered
the
compartment
and
i
had
been
alone
with
her
ever
since
so
it
was
she
who
had
robbed
me
but
how
it
had
never
left
my
shoulder
and
then
i
remembered
that
it
had
that
i
had
taken
it
off
when
i
had
changed
my
coat
and
for
the
few
moments
that
i
was
searching
for
natalie
i
remembered
that
the
woman
had
sent
me
on
that
goose
chase
and
that
at
every
other
station
she
had
tried
to
get
rid
of
me
on
some
fool
errand
illustration
i
threw
out
everything
on
the
bed
i
gave
a
roar
like
a
mad
bull
and
i
jumped
down
the
stairs
six
steps
at
a
time
i
demanded
at
the
office
if
a
distinguished
lady
of
title
possibly
a
russian
had
just
entered
the
hotel
as
i
expected
she
had
not
i
sprang
into
a
cab
and
inquired
at
two
other
hotels
and
then
i
saw
the
folly
of
trying
to
catch
her
without
outside
help
and
i
ordered
the
fellow
to
gallop
to
the
office
of
the
chief
of
police
i
told
my
story
and
the
ass
in
charge
asked
me
to
calm
myself
and
wanted
to
take
notes
i
told
him
this
was
no
time
for
taking
notes
but
for
doing
something
he
got
wrathy
at
that
and
i
demanded
to
be
taken
at
once
to
his
chief
the
chief
he
said
was
very
busy
and
could
not
see
me
so
i
showed
him
my
silver
greyhound
in
eleven
years
i
had
never
used
it
but
once
before
i
stated
in
pretty
vigorous
language
that
i
was
a
queen
s
messenger
and
that
if
the
chief
of
police
did
not
see
me
instantly
he
would
lose
his
official
head
at
that
the
fellow
jumped
off
his
high
horse
and
ran
with
me
to
his
chief
a
smart
young
chap
a
colonel
in
the
army
and
a
very
intelligent
man
i
explained
that
i
had
been
robbed
in
a
french
railway
carriage
of
a
diamond
necklace
belonging
to
the
queen
of
england
which
her
majesty
was
sending
as
a
present
to
the
czarina
of
russia
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
if
he
succeeded
in
capturing
the
thief
he
would
be
made
for
life
and
would
receive
the
gratitude
of
three
great
powers
illustration
threw
everything
in
the
out
on
the
floor
he
wasn
t
the
sort
that
thinks
second
thoughts
are
best
he
saw
russian
and
french
decorations
sprouting
all
over
his
chest
and
he
hit
a
bell
and
pressed
buttons
and
yelled
out
orders
like
the
captain
of
a
penny
steamer
in
a
fog
he
sent
her
description
to
all
the
city
gates
and
ordered
all
cabmen
and
railway
porters
to
search
all
trains
leaving
marseilles
he
ordered
all
passengers
on
outgoing
vessels
to
be
examined
and
telegraphed
the
proprietors
of
every
hotel
and
pension
to
send
him
a
complete
list
of
their
guests
within
the
hour
while
i
was
standing
there
he
must
have
given
at
least
a
hundred
orders
and
sent
out
enough
commissaires
sergeants
de
ville
gendarmes
bicycle
police
and
johnnies
to
have
captured
the
entire
german
army
when
they
had
gone
he
assured
me
that
the
woman
was
as
good
as
arrested
already
indeed
officially
she
was
arrested
for
she
had
no
more
chance
of
escape
from
marseilles
than
from
the
chateau
d
if
he
told
me
to
return
to
my
hotel
and
possess
my
soul
in
peace
within
an
hour
he
assured
me
he
would
acquaint
me
with
her
arrest
i
thanked
him
and
complimented
him
on
his
energy
and
left
him
but
i
didn
t
share
in
his
confidence
i
felt
that
she
was
a
very
clever
woman
and
a
match
for
any
and
all
of
us
it
was
all
very
well
for
him
to
be
jubilant
he
had
not
lost
the
diamonds
and
had
everything
to
gain
if
he
found
them
while
i
even
if
he
did
recover
the
necklace
would
only
be
where
i
was
before
i
lost
them
and
if
he
did
not
recover
it
i
was
a
ruined
man
it
was
an
awful
facer
for
me
i
had
always
prided
myself
on
my
record
in
eleven
years
i
had
never
mislaid
an
envelope
nor
missed
taking
the
first
train
and
now
i
had
failed
in
the
most
important
mission
that
had
ever
been
intrusted
to
me
and
it
wasn
t
a
thing
that
could
be
hushed
up
either
it
was
too
conspicuous
too
spectacular
it
was
sure
to
invite
the
widest
notoriety
i
saw
myself
ridiculed
all
over
the
continent
and
perhaps
dismissed
even
suspected
of
having
taken
the
thing
myself
i
was
walking
in
front
of
a
lighted
cafe
and
i
felt
so
sick
and
miserable
that
i
stopped
for
a
then
i
considered
that
if
i
took
one
drink
i
would
probably
in
my
present
state
of
mind
not
want
to
stop
under
twenty
and
i
decided
i
had
better
leave
it
alone
but
my
nerves
were
jumping
like
a
frightened
rabbit
and
i
felt
i
must
have
something
to
quiet
them
or
i
would
go
crazy
i
reached
for
my
but
a
cigarette
seemed
hardly
adequate
so
i
put
it
back
again
and
took
out
this
in
which
i
keep
only
the
strongest
and
blackest
cigars
i
opened
it
and
stuck
in
my
fingers
but
instead
of
a
cigar
they
touched
on
a
thin
leather
envelope
my
heart
stood
perfectly
still
i
did
not
dare
to
look
but
i
dug
my
finger
nails
into
the
leather
and
i
felt
layers
of
thin
paper
then
a
layer
of
cotton
and
then
they
scratched
on
the
facets
of
the
czarina
s
diamonds
i
stumbled
as
though
i
had
been
hit
in
the
face
and
fell
back
into
one
of
the
chairs
on
the
sidewalk
i
tore
off
the
wrappings
and
spread
out
the
diamonds
on
the
cafe
table
i
could
not
believe
they
were
real
i
twisted
the
necklace
between
my
fingers
and
crushed
it
between
my
palms
and
tossed
it
up
in
the
air
i
believe
i
almost
kissed
it
the
women
in
the
cafe
stood
tip
on
the
chairs
to
see
better
and
laughed
and
screamed
and
the
people
crowded
so
close
around
me
that
the
waiters
had
to
form
a
bodyguard
the
proprietor
thought
there
was
a
fight
and
called
for
the
police
i
was
so
happy
i
didn
t
care
i
laughed
too
and
gave
the
proprietor
a
note
and
told
him
to
stand
every
one
a
drink
then
i
tumbled
into
a
fiacre
and
galloped
off
to
my
friend
the
chief
of
police
i
felt
very
sorry
for
him
he
had
been
so
happy
at
the
chance
i
gave
him
and
he
was
sure
to
be
disappointed
when
he
learned
i
had
sent
him
off
on
a
false
alarm
but
now
that
i
had
found
the
necklace
i
did
not
want
him
to
find
the
woman
indeed
i
was
most
anxious
that
she
should
get
clear
away
for
if
she
were
caught
the
truth
would
come
out
and
i
was
likely
to
get
a
sharp
reprimand
and
sure
to
be
laughed
at
i
could
see
now
how
it
had
happened
in
my
haste
to
hide
the
diamonds
when
the
woman
was
hustled
into
the
carriage
i
had
shoved
the
cigars
into
the
satchel
and
the
diamonds
into
the
pocket
of
my
coat
now
that
i
had
the
diamonds
safe
again
it
seemed
a
very
natural
mistake
but
i
doubted
if
the
foreign
office
would
think
so
i
was
afraid
it
might
not
appreciate
the
beautiful
simplicity
of
my
secret
so
when
i
reached
the
police
station
and
found
that
the
woman
was
still
at
large
i
was
more
than
relieved
as
i
expected
the
chief
was
extremely
chagrined
when
he
learned
of
my
mistake
and
that
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
i
was
feeling
so
happy
myself
that
i
hated
to
have
any
one
else
miserable
so
i
suggested
that
this
attempt
to
steal
the
czarina
s
necklace
might
be
only
the
first
of
a
series
of
such
attempts
by
an
unscrupulous
gang
and
that
i
might
still
be
in
danger
i
winked
at
the
chief
and
the
chief
smiled
at
me
and
we
went
to
nice
together
in
a
saloon
car
with
a
guard
of
twelve
carabineers
and
twelve
men
and
the
chief
and
i
drank
champagne
all
the
way
we
marched
together
up
to
the
hotel
where
the
russian
ambassador
was
stopping
closely
surrounded
by
our
escort
of
carabineers
and
delivered
the
necklace
with
the
most
profound
ceremony
the
old
ambassador
was
immensely
impressed
and
when
we
hinted
that
already
i
had
been
made
the
object
of
an
attack
by
robbers
he
assured
us
that
his
imperial
majesty
would
not
prove
ungrateful
i
wrote
a
swinging
personal
letter
about
the
invaluable
services
of
the
chief
to
the
french
minister
of
foreign
affairs
and
they
gave
him
enough
russian
and
french
medals
to
satisfy
even
a
french
soldier
so
though
he
never
caught
the
woman
he
received
his
just
the
queen
s
messenger
paused
and
surveyed
the
faces
of
those
about
him
in
some
embarrassment
but
the
worst
of
it
is
he
added
that
the
story
must
have
got
about
for
while
the
princess
obtained
nothing
from
me
but
a
and
five
excellent
cigars
a
few
weeks
after
the
coronation
the
czar
sent
me
a
gold
with
his
monogram
in
diamonds
and
i
don
t
know
yet
whether
that
was
a
coincidence
or
whether
the
czar
wanted
me
to
know
that
he
knew
that
i
had
been
carrying
the
czarina
s
diamonds
in
my
pigskin
what
do
you
fellows
think
chapter
iii
sir
andrew
rose
with
disapproval
written
in
every
lineament
i
thought
your
story
would
bear
upon
the
murder
he
said
had
i
imagined
it
would
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
it
i
would
not
have
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
bowed
stiffly
i
wish
you
good
night
he
said
there
was
a
chorus
of
remonstrance
and
under
cover
of
this
and
the
baronet
s
answering
protests
a
servant
for
the
second
time
slipped
a
piece
of
paper
into
the
hand
of
the
gentleman
with
the
pearl
stud
he
read
the
lines
written
upon
it
and
tore
it
into
tiny
fragments
the
youngest
member
who
had
remained
an
interested
but
silent
listener
to
the
tale
of
the
queen
s
messenger
raised
his
hand
commandingly
sir
andrew
he
cried
in
justice
to
lord
arthur
chetney
i
must
ask
you
to
be
seated
he
has
been
accused
in
our
hearing
of
a
most
serious
crime
and
i
insist
that
you
remain
until
you
have
heard
me
clear
his
you
cried
the
baronet
yes
answered
the
young
man
briskly
i
would
have
spoken
sooner
he
explained
but
that
i
thought
this
gentleman
he
inclined
his
head
toward
the
queen
s
messenger
was
about
to
contribute
some
facts
of
which
i
was
ignorant
he
however
has
told
us
nothing
and
so
i
will
take
up
the
tale
at
the
point
where
lieutenant
sears
laid
it
down
and
give
you
those
details
of
which
lieutenant
sears
is
ignorant
it
seems
strange
to
you
that
i
should
be
able
to
add
the
sequel
to
this
story
but
the
coincidence
is
easily
explained
i
am
the
junior
member
of
the
law
firm
of
chudleigh
chudleigh
we
have
been
solicitors
for
the
chetneys
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
nothing
no
matter
how
unimportant
which
concerns
lord
edam
and
his
two
sons
is
unknown
to
us
and
naturally
we
are
acquainted
with
every
detail
of
the
terrible
catastrophe
of
last
the
baronet
bewildered
but
eager
sank
back
into
his
chair
will
you
be
long
sir
he
demanded
i
shall
endeavor
to
be
brief
said
the
young
solicitor
and
he
added
in
a
tone
which
gave
his
words
almost
the
weight
of
a
threat
i
promise
to
be
there
is
no
need
to
promise
that
said
sir
andrew
i
find
it
much
too
interesting
as
it
he
glanced
ruefully
at
the
clock
and
turned
his
eyes
quickly
from
it
tell
the
driver
of
that
hansom
he
called
to
the
servant
that
i
take
him
by
the
for
the
last
three
days
began
young
chudleigh
as
you
have
probably
read
in
the
daily
papers
the
marquis
of
edam
has
been
at
the
point
of
death
and
his
physicians
have
never
left
his
house
every
hour
he
seemed
to
grow
weaker
but
although
his
bodily
strength
is
apparently
leaving
him
forever
his
mind
has
remained
clear
and
active
late
yesterday
evening
word
was
received
at
our
office
that
he
wished
my
father
to
come
at
once
to
chetney
house
and
to
bring
with
him
certain
papers
what
these
papers
were
is
not
essential
i
mention
them
only
to
explain
how
it
was
that
last
night
i
happened
to
be
at
lord
edam
s
i
accompanied
my
father
to
chetney
house
but
at
the
time
we
reached
there
lord
edam
was
sleeping
and
his
physicians
refused
to
have
him
awakened
my
father
urged
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
receive
lord
edam
s
instructions
concerning
the
documents
but
the
physicians
would
not
disturb
him
and
we
all
gathered
in
the
library
to
wait
until
he
should
awake
of
his
own
accord
it
was
about
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
while
we
were
still
there
that
inspector
lyle
and
the
officers
from
scotland
yard
came
to
arrest
lord
arthur
on
the
charge
of
murdering
his
brother
you
can
imagine
our
dismay
and
distress
like
every
one
else
i
had
learned
from
the
afternoon
papers
that
lord
chetney
was
not
dead
but
that
he
had
returned
to
england
and
on
arriving
at
chetney
house
i
had
been
told
that
lord
arthur
had
gone
to
the
bath
hotel
to
look
for
his
brother
and
to
inform
him
that
if
he
wished
to
see
their
father
alive
he
must
come
to
him
at
once
although
it
was
now
past
one
o
clock
arthur
had
not
returned
none
of
us
knew
where
madame
zichy
lived
so
we
could
not
go
to
recover
lord
chetney
s
body
we
spent
a
most
miserable
night
hastening
to
the
window
whenever
a
cab
came
into
the
square
in
the
hope
that
it
was
arthur
returning
and
endeavoring
to
explain
away
the
facts
that
pointed
to
him
as
the
murderer
i
am
a
friend
of
arthur
s
i
was
with
him
at
harrow
and
at
oxford
and
i
refused
to
believe
for
an
instant
that
he
was
capable
of
such
a
crime
but
as
a
lawyer
i
could
not
help
but
see
that
the
circumstantial
evidence
was
strongly
against
him
toward
early
morning
lord
edam
awoke
and
in
so
much
better
a
state
of
health
that
he
refused
to
make
the
changes
in
the
papers
which
he
had
intended
declaring
that
he
was
no
nearer
death
than
ourselves
under
other
circumstances
this
happy
change
in
him
would
have
relieved
us
greatly
but
none
of
us
could
think
of
anything
save
the
death
of
his
elder
son
and
of
the
charge
which
hung
over
arthur
as
long
as
inspector
lyle
remained
in
the
house
my
father
decided
that
i
as
one
of
the
legal
advisers
of
the
family
should
also
remain
there
but
there
was
little
for
either
of
us
to
do
arthur
did
not
return
and
nothing
occurred
until
late
this
morning
when
lyle
received
word
that
the
russian
servant
had
been
arrested
he
at
once
drove
to
scotland
yard
to
question
him
he
came
back
to
us
in
an
hour
and
informed
me
that
the
servant
had
refused
to
tell
anything
of
what
had
happened
the
night
before
or
of
himself
or
of
the
princess
zichy
he
would
not
even
give
them
the
address
of
her
house
he
is
in
abject
terror
lyle
said
i
assured
him
that
he
was
not
suspected
of
the
crime
but
he
would
tell
me
there
were
no
other
developments
until
two
o
clock
this
afternoon
when
word
was
brought
to
us
that
arthur
had
been
found
and
that
he
was
lying
in
the
accident
ward
of
george
s
hospital
lyle
and
i
drove
there
together
and
found
him
propped
up
in
bed
with
his
head
bound
in
a
bandage
he
had
been
brought
to
the
hospital
the
night
before
by
the
driver
of
a
hansom
that
had
run
over
him
in
the
fog
the
had
kicked
him
on
the
head
and
he
had
been
carried
in
unconscious
there
was
nothing
on
him
to
tell
who
he
was
and
it
was
not
until
he
came
to
his
senses
this
afternoon
that
the
hospital
authorities
had
been
able
to
send
word
to
his
people
lyle
at
once
informed
him
that
he
was
under
arrest
and
with
what
he
was
charged
and
though
the
inspector
warned
him
to
say
nothing
which
might
be
used
against
him
i
as
his
solicitor
instructed
him
to
speak
freely
and
to
tell
us
all
he
knew
of
the
occurrences
of
last
night
it
was
evident
to
any
one
that
the
fact
of
his
brother
s
death
was
of
much
greater
concern
to
him
than
that
he
was
accused
of
his
murder
illustration
we
found
him
propped
up
in
bed
that
arthur
said
contemptuously
that
is
damned
nonsense
it
is
monstrous
and
cruel
we
parted
better
friends
than
we
have
been
in
years
i
will
tell
you
all
that
happened
not
to
clear
myself
but
to
help
you
to
find
out
the
his
story
is
as
follows
yesterday
afternoon
owing
to
his
constant
attendance
on
his
father
he
did
not
look
at
the
evening
papers
and
it
was
not
until
after
dinner
when
the
butler
brought
him
one
and
told
him
of
its
contents
that
he
learned
that
his
brother
was
alive
and
at
the
bath
hotel
he
drove
there
at
once
but
was
told
that
about
eight
o
clock
his
brother
had
gone
out
but
without
giving
any
clew
to
his
destination
as
chetney
had
not
at
once
come
to
see
his
father
arthur
decided
that
he
was
still
angry
with
him
and
his
mind
turning
naturally
to
the
cause
of
their
quarrel
determined
him
to
look
for
chetney
at
the
home
of
the
princess
zichy
her
house
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
and
though
he
had
never
visited
it
he
had
passed
it
many
times
and
knew
its
exact
location
he
accordingly
drove
in
that
direction
as
far
as
the
fog
would
permit
the
hansom
to
go
and
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
reaching
the
house
about
nine
o
clock
he
rang
and
was
admitted
by
the
russian
servant
the
man
took
his
card
into
the
and
at
once
his
brother
ran
out
and
welcomed
him
he
was
followed
by
the
princess
zichy
who
also
received
arthur
most
cordially
you
brothers
will
have
much
to
talk
about
she
said
i
am
going
to
the
when
you
have
finished
let
me
as
soon
as
she
had
left
them
arthur
told
his
brother
that
their
father
was
not
expected
to
outlive
the
night
and
that
he
must
come
to
him
at
once
this
is
not
the
moment
to
remember
your
quarrel
arthur
said
to
him
you
have
come
back
from
the
dead
only
in
time
to
make
your
peace
with
him
before
he
arthur
says
that
at
this
chetney
was
greatly
moved
you
entirely
misunderstand
me
arthur
he
returned
i
did
not
know
the
governor
was
ill
or
i
would
have
gone
to
him
the
instant
i
arrived
my
only
reason
for
not
doing
so
was
because
i
thought
he
was
still
angry
with
me
i
shall
return
with
you
immediately
as
soon
as
i
have
said
to
the
princess
it
is
a
final
after
tonight
i
shall
never
see
her
do
you
mean
that
arthur
cried
yes
chetney
answered
when
i
returned
to
london
i
had
no
intention
of
seeking
her
again
and
i
am
here
only
through
a
he
then
told
arthur
that
he
had
separated
from
the
princess
even
before
he
went
to
central
africa
and
that
moreover
while
at
cairo
on
his
way
south
he
had
learned
certain
facts
concerning
her
life
there
during
the
previous
season
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
ever
wish
to
see
her
again
their
separation
was
final
and
complete
she
deceived
me
cruelly
he
said
i
can
not
tell
you
how
cruelly
during
the
two
years
when
i
was
trying
to
obtain
my
father
s
consent
to
our
marriage
she
was
in
love
with
a
russian
diplomat
during
all
that
time
he
was
secretly
visiting
her
here
in
london
and
her
trip
to
cairo
was
only
an
excuse
to
meet
him
yet
you
are
here
with
her
tonight
arthur
protested
only
a
few
hours
after
your
that
is
easily
explained
chetney
answered
as
i
finished
dinner
tonight
at
the
hotel
i
received
a
note
from
her
from
this
address
in
it
she
said
she
had
but
just
learned
of
my
arrival
and
begged
me
to
come
to
her
at
once
she
wrote
that
she
was
in
great
and
present
trouble
dying
of
an
incurable
illness
and
without
friends
or
money
she
begged
me
for
the
sake
of
old
times
to
come
to
her
assistance
during
the
last
two
years
in
the
jungle
all
my
former
feeling
for
ziehy
has
utterly
passed
away
but
no
one
could
have
dismissed
the
appeal
she
made
in
that
letter
so
i
came
here
and
found
her
as
you
have
seen
her
quite
as
beautiful
as
she
ever
was
in
very
good
health
and
from
the
look
of
the
house
in
no
need
of
money
i
asked
her
what
she
meant
by
writing
me
that
she
was
dying
in
a
garret
and
she
laughed
and
said
she
had
done
so
because
she
was
afraid
unless
i
thought
she
needed
help
i
would
not
try
to
see
her
that
was
where
we
were
when
you
arrived
and
now
chetney
added
i
will
say
to
her
and
you
had
better
return
home
no
you
can
trust
me
i
shall
follow
you
at
once
she
has
no
influence
over
me
now
but
i
believe
in
spite
of
the
way
she
has
used
me
that
she
is
after
her
queer
fashion
still
fond
of
me
and
when
she
learns
that
this
is
final
there
may
be
a
scene
and
it
is
not
fair
to
her
that
you
should
be
here
so
go
home
at
once
and
tell
the
governor
that
i
am
following
you
in
ten
that
said
arthur
is
the
way
we
parted
i
never
left
him
on
more
friendly
terms
i
was
happy
to
see
him
alive
again
i
was
happy
to
think
he
had
returned
in
time
to
make
up
his
quarrel
with
my
father
and
i
was
happy
that
at
last
he
was
shut
of
that
woman
i
was
never
better
pleased
with
him
in
my
he
turned
to
inspector
lyle
who
was
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
taking
notes
of
all
he
told
us
why
in
the
name
of
common
sense
he
cried
should
i
have
chosen
that
moment
of
all
others
to
send
my
brother
back
to
the
grave
for
a
moment
the
inspector
did
not
answer
him
i
do
not
know
if
any
of
you
gentlemen
are
acquainted
with
inspector
lyle
but
if
you
are
not
i
can
assure
you
that
he
is
a
very
remarkable
man
our
firm
often
applies
to
him
for
aid
and
he
has
never
failed
us
my
father
has
the
greatest
possible
respect
for
him
where
he
has
the
advantage
over
the
ordinary
police
official
is
in
the
fact
that
he
possesses
imagination
he
imagines
himself
to
be
the
criminal
imagines
how
he
would
act
under
the
same
circumstances
and
he
imagines
to
such
purpose
that
he
generally
finds
the
man
he
wants
i
have
often
told
lyle
that
if
he
had
not
been
a
detective
he
would
have
made
a
great
success
as
a
poet
or
a
playwright
when
arthur
turned
on
him
lyle
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
told
him
exactly
what
was
the
case
against
him
ever
since
your
brother
was
reported
as
having
died
in
africa
he
said
your
lordship
has
been
collecting
money
on
post
obits
lord
chetney
s
arrival
last
night
turned
them
into
waste
paper
you
were
suddenly
in
debt
for
thousands
of
pounds
for
much
more
than
you
could
ever
possibly
pay
no
one
knew
that
you
and
your
brother
had
met
at
madame
zichy
s
but
you
knew
that
your
father
was
not
expected
to
outlive
the
night
and
that
if
your
brother
were
dead
also
you
would
be
saved
from
complete
ruin
and
that
you
would
become
the
marquis
of
oh
that
is
how
you
have
worked
it
out
is
it
arthur
cried
and
for
me
to
become
lord
edam
was
it
necessary
that
the
woman
should
die
too
they
will
say
lyle
answered
that
she
was
a
witness
to
the
murder
that
she
would
have
then
why
did
i
not
kill
the
servant
as
well
arthur
said
he
was
asleep
and
saw
and
you
believe
arthur
demanded
it
is
not
a
question
of
what
i
believe
lyle
said
gravely
it
is
a
question
for
your
the
man
is
insolent
arthur
cried
the
thing
is
monstrous
horrible
before
we
could
stop
him
he
sprang
out
of
his
cot
and
began
pulling
on
his
clothes
when
the
nurses
tried
to
hold
him
down
he
fought
with
them
do
you
think
you
can
keep
me
here
he
shouted
when
they
are
plotting
to
hang
me
i
am
going
with
you
to
that
house
he
cried
at
lyle
when
you
find
those
bodies
i
shall
be
beside
you
it
is
my
right
he
is
my
brother
he
has
been
murdered
and
i
can
tell
you
who
murdered
him
that
woman
murdered
him
she
first
ruined
his
life
and
now
she
has
killed
him
for
the
last
five
years
she
has
been
plotting
to
make
herself
his
wife
and
last
night
when
he
told
her
he
had
discovered
the
truth
about
the
russian
and
that
she
would
never
see
him
again
she
flew
into
a
passion
and
stabbed
him
and
then
in
terror
of
the
gallows
killed
herself
she
murdered
him
i
tell
you
and
i
promise
you
that
we
will
find
the
knife
she
used
near
her
perhaps
still
in
her
hand
what
will
you
say
to
that
lyle
turned
his
head
away
and
stared
down
at
the
floor
i
might
say
he
answered
that
you
placed
it
arthur
gave
a
cry
of
anger
and
sprang
at
him
and
then
pitched
forward
into
his
arms
the
blood
was
running
from
the
cut
under
the
bandage
and
he
had
fainted
lyle
carried
him
back
to
the
bed
again
and
we
left
him
with
the
police
and
the
doctors
and
drove
at
once
to
the
address
he
had
given
us
we
found
the
house
not
three
minutes
walk
from
george
s
hospital
it
stands
in
trevor
terrace
that
little
row
of
houses
set
back
from
knightsbridge
with
one
end
in
hill
street
as
we
left
the
hospital
lyle
had
said
to
me
you
must
not
blame
me
for
treating
him
as
i
did
all
is
fair
in
this
work
and
if
by
angering
that
boy
i
could
have
made
him
commit
himself
i
was
right
in
trying
to
do
so
though
i
assure
you
no
one
would
be
better
pleased
than
myself
if
i
could
prove
his
theory
to
be
correct
but
we
can
not
tell
everything
depends
upon
what
we
see
for
ourselves
within
the
next
few
when
we
reached
the
house
lyle
broke
open
the
fastenings
of
one
of
the
windows
on
the
ground
floor
and
hidden
by
the
trees
in
the
garden
we
scrambled
in
we
found
ourselves
in
the
which
was
the
first
room
on
the
right
of
the
hall
the
gas
was
still
burning
behind
the
colored
glass
and
red
silk
shades
and
when
the
daylight
streamed
in
after
us
it
gave
the
hall
a
hideously
dissipated
look
like
the
foyer
of
a
theatre
at
a
matinee
or
the
entrance
to
an
gambling
hell
the
house
was
oppressively
silent
and
because
we
knew
why
it
was
so
silent
we
spoke
in
whispers
when
lyle
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
i
felt
as
though
some
one
had
put
his
hand
upon
my
throat
but
i
followed
close
at
his
shoulder
and
saw
in
the
subdued
light
of
lamps
the
body
of
chetney
at
the
foot
of
the
divan
just
as
lieutenant
sears
had
described
it
in
the
we
found
the
body
of
the
princess
zichy
her
arms
thrown
out
and
the
blood
from
her
heart
frozen
in
a
tiny
line
across
her
bare
shoulder
but
neither
of
us
although
we
searched
the
floor
on
our
hands
and
knees
could
find
the
weapon
which
had
killed
her
illustration
we
found
the
body
of
the
princess
zichy
for
arthur
s
sake
i
said
i
would
have
given
a
thousand
pounds
if
we
had
found
the
knife
in
her
hand
as
he
said
we
that
we
have
not
found
it
there
lyle
answered
is
to
my
mind
the
strongest
proof
that
he
is
telling
the
truth
that
he
left
the
house
before
the
murder
took
place
he
is
not
a
fool
and
had
he
stabbed
his
brother
and
this
woman
he
would
have
seen
that
by
placing
the
knife
near
her
he
could
help
to
make
it
appear
as
if
she
had
killed
chetney
and
then
committed
suicide
besides
lord
arthur
insisted
that
the
evidence
in
his
behalf
would
be
our
finding
the
knife
here
he
would
not
have
urged
that
if
he
knew
we
would
find
it
if
he
knew
he
himself
had
carried
it
away
this
is
no
suicide
a
suicide
does
not
rise
and
hide
the
weapon
with
which
he
kills
himself
and
then
lie
down
again
no
this
has
been
a
double
murder
and
we
must
look
outside
of
the
house
for
the
while
he
was
speaking
lyle
and
i
had
been
searching
every
corner
studying
the
details
of
each
room
i
was
so
afraid
that
without
telling
me
he
would
make
some
deductions
prejudicial
to
arthur
that
i
never
left
his
side
i
was
determined
to
see
everything
that
he
saw
and
if
possible
to
prevent
his
interpreting
it
in
the
wrong
way
he
finally
finished
his
examination
and
we
sat
down
together
in
the
and
he
took
out
his
notebook
and
read
aloud
all
that
sears
had
told
him
of
the
murder
and
what
we
had
just
learned
from
arthur
we
compared
the
two
accounts
word
for
word
and
weighed
statement
with
statement
but
i
could
not
determine
from
anything
lyle
said
which
of
the
two
versions
he
had
decided
to
believe
we
are
trying
to
build
a
house
of
blocks
he
exclaimed
with
half
of
the
blocks
missing
we
have
been
considering
two
theories
he
went
on
one
that
lord
arthur
is
responsible
for
both
murders
and
the
other
that
the
dead
woman
in
there
is
responsible
for
one
of
them
and
has
committed
suicide
but
until
the
russian
servant
is
ready
to
talk
i
shall
refuse
to
believe
in
the
guilt
of
what
can
you
prove
by
him
i
asked
he
was
drunk
and
asleep
he
saw
lyle
hesitated
and
then
as
though
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
be
quite
frank
with
me
spoke
freely
i
do
not
know
that
he
was
either
drunk
or
asleep
he
answered
lieutenant
sears
describes
him
as
a
stupid
boor
i
am
not
satisfied
that
he
is
not
a
clever
actor
what
was
his
position
in
this
house
what
was
his
real
duty
here
suppose
it
was
not
to
guard
this
woman
but
to
watch
her
let
us
imagine
that
it
was
not
the
woman
he
served
but
a
master
and
see
where
that
leads
us
for
this
house
has
a
master
a
mysterious
absentee
landlord
who
lives
in
petersburg
the
unknown
russian
who
came
between
chetney
and
zichy
and
because
of
whom
chetney
left
her
he
is
the
man
who
bought
this
house
for
madame
zichy
who
sent
these
rugs
and
curtains
from
petersburg
to
furnish
it
for
her
after
his
own
tastes
and
i
believe
it
was
he
also
who
placed
the
russian
servant
here
ostensibly
to
serve
the
princess
but
in
reality
to
spy
upon
her
at
scotland
yard
we
do
not
know
who
this
gentleman
is
the
russian
police
confess
to
equal
ignorance
concerning
him
when
lord
chetney
went
to
africa
madame
zichy
lived
in
petersburg
but
there
her
receptions
and
dinners
were
so
crowded
with
members
of
the
nobility
and
of
the
army
and
diplomats
that
among
so
many
visitors
the
police
could
not
learn
which
was
the
one
for
whom
she
most
greatly
lyle
pointed
at
the
modern
french
paintings
and
the
heavy
silk
rugs
which
hung
upon
the
walls
the
unknown
is
a
man
of
taste
and
of
some
fortune
he
said
not
the
sort
of
man
to
send
a
stupid
peasant
to
guard
the
woman
he
loves
so
i
am
not
content
to
believe
with
sears
that
the
servant
is
a
boor
i
believe
him
instead
to
be
a
very
clever
ruffian
i
believe
him
to
be
the
protector
of
his
master
s
honor
or
let
us
say
of
his
master
s
property
whether
that
property
be
silver
plate
or
the
woman
his
master
loves
last
night
after
lord
arthur
had
gone
away
the
servant
was
left
alone
in
this
house
with
lord
chetney
and
madame
zichy
from
where
he
sat
in
the
hall
he
could
hear
lord
chetney
bidding
her
farewell
for
if
my
idea
of
him
is
correct
he
understands
english
quite
as
well
as
you
or
i
let
us
imagine
that
he
heard
her
entreating
chetney
not
to
leave
her
reminding
him
of
his
former
wish
to
marry
her
and
let
us
suppose
that
he
hears
chetney
denounce
her
and
tell
her
that
at
cairo
he
has
learned
of
this
russian
admirer
the
servant
s
master
he
hears
the
woman
declare
that
she
has
had
no
admirer
but
himself
that
this
unknown
russian
was
and
is
nothing
to
her
that
there
is
no
man
she
loves
but
him
and
that
she
can
not
live
knowing
that
he
is
alive
without
his
love
suppose
chetney
believed
her
suppose
his
former
infatuation
for
her
returned
and
that
in
a
moment
of
weakness
he
forgave
her
and
took
her
in
his
arms
that
is
the
moment
the
russian
master
has
feared
it
is
to
guard
against
it
that
he
has
placed
his
watchdog
over
the
princess
and
how
do
we
know
but
that
when
the
moment
came
the
watchdog
served
his
master
as
he
saw
his
duty
and
killed
them
both
what
do
you
think
lyle
demanded
would
not
that
explain
both
murders
illustration
entreating
chetney
not
to
leave
her
i
was
only
too
willing
to
hear
any
theory
which
pointed
to
any
one
else
as
the
criminal
than
arthur
but
lyle
s
explanation
was
too
utterly
fantastic
i
told
him
that
he
certainly
showed
imagination
but
that
he
could
not
hang
a
man
for
what
he
imagined
he
had
done
no
lyle
answered
but
i
can
frighten
him
by
telling
him
what
i
think
he
has
done
and
now
when
i
again
question
the
russian
servant
i
will
make
it
quite
clear
to
him
that
i
believe
he
is
the
murderer
i
think
that
will
open
his
mouth
a
man
will
at
least
talk
to
defend
himself
come
he
said
we
must
return
at
once
to
scotland
yard
and
see
him
there
is
nothing
more
to
do
he
arose
and
i
followed
him
into
the
hall
and
in
another
minute
we
would
have
been
on
our
way
to
scotland
yard
but
just
as
he
opened
the
street
door
a
postman
halted
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
and
began
fumbling
with
the
latch
lyle
stopped
with
an
exclamation
of
chagrin
how
stupid
of
me
he
exclaimed
he
turned
quickly
and
pointed
to
a
narrow
slit
cut
in
the
brass
plate
of
the
front
door
the
house
has
a
private
he
said
and
i
had
not
thought
to
look
in
it
if
we
had
gone
out
as
we
came
in
by
the
window
i
would
never
have
seen
it
the
moment
i
entered
the
house
i
should
have
thought
of
securing
the
letters
which
came
this
morning
i
have
been
grossly
he
stepped
back
into
the
hall
and
pulled
at
the
lid
of
the
letterbox
which
hung
on
the
inside
of
the
door
but
it
was
tightly
locked
at
the
same
moment
the
postman
came
up
the
steps
holding
a
letter
without
a
word
lyle
took
it
from
his
hand
and
began
to
examine
it
it
was
addressed
to
the
princess
zichy
and
on
the
back
of
the
envelope
was
the
name
of
a
west
end
dressmaker
that
is
of
no
use
to
me
lyle
said
he
took
out
his
card
and
showed
it
to
the
postman
i
am
inspector
lyle
from
scotland
yard
he
said
the
people
in
this
house
are
under
arrest
everything
it
contains
is
now
in
my
keeping
did
you
deliver
any
other
letters
here
this
morning
the
man
looked
frightened
but
answered
promptly
that
he
was
now
upon
his
third
round
he
had
made
one
postal
delivery
at
seven
that
morning
and
another
at
eleven
how
many
letters
did
you
leave
here
lyle
asked
about
six
altogether
the
man
answered
did
you
put
them
through
the
door
into
the
the
postman
said
yes
i
always
slip
them
into
the
box
and
ring
and
go
away
the
servants
collect
them
from
the
have
you
noticed
if
any
of
the
letters
you
leave
here
bear
a
russian
postage
stamp
lyle
asked
the
man
answered
oh
yes
sir
a
great
from
the
same
person
would
you
say
the
writing
seems
to
be
the
same
the
man
answered
they
come
regularly
about
once
a
week
one
of
those
i
delivered
this
morning
had
a
russian
that
will
do
said
lyle
eagerly
thank
you
thank
you
very
he
ran
back
into
the
hall
and
pulling
out
his
penknife
began
to
pick
at
the
lock
of
the
i
have
been
supremely
careless
he
said
in
great
excitement
twice
before
when
people
i
wanted
had
flown
from
a
house
i
have
been
able
to
follow
them
by
putting
a
guard
over
their
these
letters
which
arrive
regularly
every
week
from
russia
in
the
same
handwriting
they
can
come
but
from
one
person
at
least
we
shall
now
know
the
name
of
the
master
of
this
house
undoubtedly
it
is
one
of
his
letters
that
the
man
placed
here
this
morning
we
may
make
a
most
important
as
he
was
talking
he
was
picking
at
the
lock
with
his
knife
but
he
was
so
impatient
to
reach
the
letters
that
he
pressed
too
heavily
on
the
blade
and
it
broke
in
his
hand
i
took
a
step
backward
and
drove
my
heel
into
the
lock
and
burst
it
open
the
lid
flew
back
and
we
pressed
forward
and
each
ran
his
hand
down
into
the
letterbox
for
a
moment
we
were
both
too
startled
to
move
the
box
was
empty
i
do
not
know
how
long
we
stood
staring
stupidly
at
each
other
but
it
was
lyle
who
was
the
first
to
recover
he
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
pointed
excitedly
into
the
empty
box
do
you
appreciate
what
that
means
he
cried
it
means
that
some
one
has
been
here
ahead
of
us
some
one
has
entered
this
house
not
three
hours
before
we
came
since
eleven
o
clock
this
it
was
the
russian
servant
i
exclaimed
the
russian
servant
has
been
under
arrest
at
scotland
yard
lyle
cried
he
could
not
have
taken
the
letters
lord
arthur
has
been
in
his
cot
at
the
hospital
that
is
his
alibi
there
is
some
one
else
some
one
we
do
not
suspect
and
that
some
one
is
the
murderer
he
came
back
here
either
to
obtain
those
letters
because
he
knew
they
would
convict
him
or
to
remove
something
he
had
left
here
at
the
time
of
the
murder
something
incriminating
the
weapon
perhaps
or
some
personal
article
a
a
handkerchief
with
his
name
upon
it
or
a
pair
of
gloves
whatever
it
was
it
must
have
been
damning
evidence
against
him
to
have
made
him
take
so
desperate
a
how
do
we
know
i
whispered
that
he
is
not
hidden
here
now
no
i
ll
swear
he
is
not
lyle
answered
i
may
have
bungled
in
some
things
but
i
have
searched
this
house
thoroughly
nevertheless
he
added
we
must
go
over
it
again
from
the
cellar
to
the
roof
we
have
the
real
clew
now
and
we
must
forget
the
others
and
work
only
as
he
spoke
he
began
again
to
search
the
turning
over
even
the
books
on
the
tables
and
the
music
on
the
piano
whoever
the
man
is
he
said
over
his
shoulder
we
know
that
he
has
a
key
to
the
front
door
and
a
key
to
the
that
shows
us
he
is
either
an
inmate
of
the
house
or
that
he
comes
here
when
he
wishes
the
russian
says
that
he
was
the
only
servant
in
the
house
certainly
we
have
found
no
evidence
to
show
that
any
other
servant
slept
here
there
could
be
but
one
other
person
who
would
possess
a
key
to
the
house
and
the
and
he
lives
in
petersburg
at
the
time
of
the
murder
he
was
two
thousand
miles
lyle
interrupted
himself
suddenly
with
a
sharp
cry
and
turned
upon
me
with
his
eyes
flashing
but
was
he
he
cried
was
he
how
do
we
know
that
last
night
he
was
not
in
london
in
this
very
house
when
zichy
and
chetney
met
he
stood
staring
at
me
without
seeing
me
muttering
and
arguing
with
himself
don
t
speak
to
me
he
cried
as
i
ventured
to
interrupt
him
i
can
see
it
now
it
is
all
plain
it
was
not
the
servant
but
his
master
the
russian
himself
and
it
was
he
who
came
back
for
the
letters
he
came
back
for
them
because
he
knew
they
would
convict
him
we
must
find
them
we
must
have
those
letters
if
we
find
the
one
with
the
russian
postmark
we
shall
have
found
the
he
spoke
like
a
madman
and
as
he
spoke
he
ran
around
the
room
with
one
hand
held
out
in
front
of
him
as
you
have
seen
a
at
a
theatre
seeking
for
something
hidden
in
the
stalls
he
pulled
the
old
letters
from
the
and
ran
them
over
as
swiftly
as
a
gambler
deals
out
cards
he
dropped
on
his
knees
before
the
fireplace
and
dragged
out
the
dead
coals
with
his
bare
fingers
and
then
with
a
low
worried
cry
like
a
hound
on
a
scent
he
ran
back
to
the
basket
and
lifting
the
papers
from
it
shook
them
out
upon
the
floor
instantly
he
gave
a
shout
of
triumph
and
separating
a
number
of
torn
pieces
from
the
others
held
them
up
before
me
look
he
cried
do
you
see
here
are
five
letters
torn
across
in
two
places
the
russian
did
not
stop
to
read
them
for
as
you
see
he
has
left
them
still
sealed
i
have
been
wrong
he
did
not
return
for
the
letters
he
could
not
have
known
their
value
he
must
have
returned
for
some
other
reason
and
as
he
was
leaving
saw
the
and
taking
out
the
letters
held
them
together
so
and
tore
them
twice
across
and
then
as
the
fire
had
gone
out
tossed
them
into
this
basket
look
he
cried
here
in
the
upper
corner
of
this
piece
is
a
russian
stamp
this
is
his
own
letter
unopened
we
examined
the
russian
stamp
and
found
it
had
been
cancelled
in
petersburg
four
days
ago
the
back
of
the
envelope
bore
the
postmark
of
the
branch
station
in
upper
sloane
street
and
was
dated
this
morning
the
envelope
was
of
official
blue
paper
and
we
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
two
other
parts
of
it
we
drew
the
torn
pieces
of
the
letter
from
them
and
joined
them
together
side
by
side
there
were
but
two
lines
of
writing
and
this
was
the
message
i
leave
petersburg
on
the
night
train
and
i
shall
see
you
at
trevor
terrace
after
dinner
monday
that
was
last
night
lyle
cried
he
arrived
twelve
hours
ahead
of
his
letter
but
it
came
in
time
it
came
in
time
to
hang
him
the
baronet
struck
the
table
with
his
hand
the
name
he
demanded
how
was
it
signed
what
was
the
man
s
name
the
young
solicitor
rose
to
his
feet
and
leaning
forward
stretched
out
his
arm
there
was
no
name
he
cried
the
letter
was
signed
with
only
two
initials
but
engraved
at
the
top
of
the
sheet
was
the
man
s
address
that
address
was
the
american
embassy
petersburg
bureau
or
the
naval
attache
and
the
initials
he
shouted
his
voice
rising
into
an
exultant
and
bitter
cry
were
those
of
the
gentleman
who
sits
opposite
who
told
us
that
he
was
the
first
to
find
the
murdered
bodies
the
naval
attache
to
russia
lieutenant
sears
a
strained
and
awful
hush
followed
the
solicitor
s
words
which
seemed
to
vibrate
like
a
twanging
bowstring
that
had
just
hurled
its
bolt
sir
andrew
pale
and
staring
drew
away
with
an
exclamation
of
repulsion
his
eyes
were
fastened
upon
the
naval
attache
with
fascinated
horror
but
the
american
emitted
a
sigh
of
great
content
and
sank
comfortably
into
the
arms
of
his
chair
he
clapped
his
hands
softly
together
capital
he
murmured
i
give
you
my
word
i
never
guessed
what
you
were
driving
at
you
fooled
i
ll
be
hanged
if
you
didn
t
you
certainly
fooled
the
man
with
the
pearl
stud
leaned
forward
with
a
nervous
gesture
hush
be
careful
he
whispered
but
at
that
instant
for
the
third
time
a
servant
hastening
through
the
room
handed
him
a
piece
of
paper
which
he
scanned
eagerly
the
message
on
the
paper
read
the
light
over
the
commons
is
out
the
house
has
the
man
with
the
black
pearl
gave
a
mighty
shout
and
tossed
the
paper
from
him
upon
the
table
hurrah
he
cried
the
house
is
up
we
ve
won
he
caught
up
his
glass
and
slapped
the
naval
attache
violently
upon
the
shoulder
he
nodded
joyously
at
him
at
the
solicitor
and
at
the
queen
s
messenger
gentlemen
to
you
he
cried
my
thanks
and
my
congratulations
he
drank
deep
from
the
glass
and
breathed
forth
a
long
sigh
of
satisfaction
and
relief
but
i
say
protested
the
queen
s
messenger
shaking
his
finger
violently
at
the
solicitor
that
story
won
t
do
you
didn
t
play
fair
and
and
you
talked
so
fast
i
couldn
t
make
out
what
it
was
all
about
i
ll
bet
you
that
evidence
wouldn
t
hold
in
a
court
of
law
you
couldn
t
hang
a
cat
on
such
evidence
your
story
is
condemned
now
my
story
might
have
happened
my
story
bore
the
mark
in
the
joy
of
creation
the
had
forgotten
their
audience
until
a
sudden
exclamation
from
sir
andrew
caused
them
to
turn
guiltily
toward
him
his
face
was
knit
with
lines
of
anger
doubt
and
amazement
what
does
this
mean
he
cried
is
this
a
jest
or
are
you
mad
if
you
know
this
man
is
a
murderer
why
is
he
at
large
is
this
a
game
you
have
been
playing
explain
yourselves
at
once
what
does
it
mean
the
american
with
first
a
glance
at
the
others
rose
and
bowed
courteously
i
am
not
a
murderer
sir
andrew
believe
me
he
said
you
need
not
be
alarmed
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
this
moment
i
am
much
more
afraid
of
you
than
you
could
possibly
be
of
me
i
beg
you
please
to
be
indulgent
i
assure
you
we
meant
no
disrespect
we
have
been
matching
stories
that
is
all
pretending
that
we
are
people
we
are
not
endeavoring
to
entertain
you
with
better
detective
tales
than
for
instance
the
last
one
you
read
the
great
rand
the
baronet
brushed
his
hand
nervously
across
his
forehead
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
he
exclaimed
that
none
of
this
has
happened
that
lord
chetney
is
not
dead
that
his
solicitor
did
not
find
a
letter
of
yours
written
from
your
post
in
petersburg
and
that
just
now
when
he
charged
you
with
murder
he
was
in
jest
i
am
really
very
sorry
said
the
american
but
you
see
sir
he
could
not
have
found
a
letter
written
by
me
in
petersburg
because
i
have
never
been
in
petersburg
until
this
week
i
have
never
been
outside
of
my
own
country
i
am
not
a
naval
officer
i
am
a
writer
of
short
stories
and
tonight
when
this
gentleman
told
me
that
you
were
fond
of
detective
stories
i
thought
it
would
be
amusing
to
tell
you
one
of
my
own
one
i
had
just
mapped
out
this
but
lord
chetney
a
real
person
interrupted
the
baronet
and
he
did
go
to
africa
two
years
ago
and
he
was
supposed
to
have
died
there
and
his
brother
lord
arthur
has
been
the
heir
and
yesterday
chetney
did
return
i
read
it
in
the
so
did
i
assented
the
american
soothingly
and
it
struck
me
as
being
a
very
good
plot
for
a
story
i
mean
his
unexpected
return
from
the
dead
and
the
probable
disappointment
of
the
younger
brother
so
i
decided
that
the
younger
brother
had
better
murder
the
older
one
the
princess
zichy
i
invented
out
of
a
clear
sky
the
fog
i
did
not
have
to
invent
since
last
night
i
know
all
that
there
is
to
know
about
a
london
fog
i
was
lost
in
one
for
three
the
baronet
turned
grimly
upon
the
queen
s
messenger
but
this
gentleman
he
protested
he
is
not
a
writer
of
short
stories
he
is
a
member
of
the
foreign
office
i
have
often
seen
him
in
whitehall
and
according
to
him
the
princess
zichy
is
not
an
invention
he
says
she
is
very
well
known
that
she
tried
to
rob
the
servant
of
the
foreign
office
looked
unhappily
at
the
cabinet
minister
and
puffed
nervously
on
his
cigar
it
s
true
sir
andrew
that
i
am
a
queen
s
messenger
he
said
appealingly
and
a
russian
woman
once
did
try
to
rob
a
queen
s
messenger
in
a
railway
carriage
only
it
did
not
happen
to
me
but
to
a
pal
of
mine
the
only
russian
princess
i
ever
knew
called
herself
zabrisky
you
may
have
seen
her
she
used
to
do
a
dive
from
the
roof
of
the
sir
andrew
with
a
snort
of
indignation
fronted
the
young
solicitor
and
i
suppose
yours
was
a
story
too
he
said
of
course
it
must
have
been
since
lord
chetney
is
not
dead
but
don
t
tell
me
he
protested
that
you
are
not
chudleigh
s
son
i
m
sorry
said
the
youngest
member
smiling
in
some
embarrassment
but
my
name
is
not
chudleigh
i
assure
you
though
that
i
know
the
family
very
well
and
that
i
am
on
very
good
terms
with
you
should
be
exclaimed
the
baronet
and
judging
from
the
liberties
you
take
with
the
chetneys
you
had
better
be
on
very
good
terms
with
them
the
young
man
leaned
back
and
glanced
toward
the
servants
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
it
has
been
so
long
since
i
have
been
in
the
club
he
said
that
i
doubt
if
even
the
waiters
remember
me
perhaps
joseph
may
he
added
joseph
he
called
and
at
the
word
a
servant
stepped
briskly
forward
the
young
man
pointed
to
the
stuffed
head
of
a
great
lion
which
was
suspended
above
the
fireplace
joseph
he
said
i
want
you
to
tell
these
gentlemen
who
shot
that
lion
who
presented
it
to
the
grill
joseph
unused
to
acting
as
master
of
ceremonies
to
members
of
the
club
shifted
nervously
from
one
foot
to
the
other
why
you
you
did
he
stammered
of
course
i
did
exclaimed
the
young
man
i
mean
what
is
the
name
of
the
man
who
shot
it
tell
the
gentlemen
who
i
am
they
wouldn
t
believe
who
you
are
my
lord
said
joseph
you
are
lord
edam
s
son
the
earl
of
you
must
admit
said
lord
chetney
when
the
noise
had
died
away
that
i
couldn
t
remain
dead
while
my
little
brother
was
accused
of
murder
i
had
to
do
something
family
pride
demanded
it
now
arthur
as
the
younger
brother
can
t
afford
to
be
squeamish
but
personally
i
should
hate
to
have
a
brother
of
mine
hanged
for
you
certainly
showed
no
scruples
against
hanging
me
said
the
american
but
in
the
face
of
your
evidence
i
admit
my
guilt
and
i
sentence
myself
to
pay
the
full
penalty
of
the
law
as
we
are
made
to
pay
it
in
my
own
country
the
order
of
this
court
is
he
announced
that
joseph
shall
bring
me
a
and
that
i
sign
it
for
five
bottles
of
the
club
s
best
oh
no
protested
the
man
with
the
pearl
stud
it
is
not
for
to
sign
it
in
my
opinion
it
is
sir
andrew
who
should
pay
the
costs
it
is
time
you
knew
he
said
turning
to
that
gentleman
that
unconsciously
you
have
been
the
victim
of
what
i
may
call
a
patriotic
conspiracy
these
stories
have
had
a
more
serious
purpose
than
merely
to
amuse
they
have
been
told
with
the
worthy
object
of
detaining
you
from
the
house
of
commons
i
must
explain
to
you
that
all
through
this
evening
i
have
had
a
servant
waiting
in
trafalgar
square
with
instructions
to
bring
me
word
as
soon
as
the
light
over
the
house
of
commons
had
ceased
to
burn
the
light
is
now
out
and
the
object
for
which
we
plotted
is
the
baronet
glanced
keenly
at
the
man
with
the
black
pearl
and
then
quickly
at
his
watch
the
smile
disappeared
from
his
lips
and
his
face
was
set
in
stern
and
forbidding
lines
and
may
i
know
he
asked
icily
what
was
the
object
of
your
plot
a
most
worthy
one
the
other
retorted
our
object
was
to
keep
you
from
advocating
the
expenditure
of
many
millions
of
the
people
s
money
upon
more
battleships
in
a
word
we
have
been
working
together
to
prevent
you
from
passing
the
navy
increase
sir
andrew
s
face
bloomed
with
brilliant
color
his
body
shook
with
suppressed
emotion
illustration
what
was
the
object
of
your
plot
my
dear
sir
he
cried
you
should
spend
more
time
at
the
house
and
less
at
your
club
the
navy
bill
was
brought
up
on
its
third
reading
at
eight
o
clock
this
evening
i
spoke
for
three
hours
in
its
favor
my
only
reason
for
wishing
to
return
again
to
the
house
was
to
sup
on
the
terrace
with
my
old
friend
admiral
simons
for
my
work
at
the
house
was
completed
five
hours
ago
when
the
navy
increase
bill
was
passed
by
an
overwhelming
the
baronet
rose
and
bowed
i
have
to
thank
you
sir
he
said
for
a
most
interesting
the
american
shoved
the
which
joseph
had
given
him
toward
the
gentleman
with
the
black
pearl
you
sign
it
he
said
the
