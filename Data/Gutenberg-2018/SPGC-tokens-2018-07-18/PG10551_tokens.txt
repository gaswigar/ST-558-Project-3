affair
in
araby
by
talbot
mundy
chapter
i
i
make
one
to
give
this
feisul
boy
a
hoist
whoever
invented
chess
understood
the
world
works
as
some
men
know
clocks
and
watches
he
recognized
a
fact
and
based
a
game
on
it
with
the
result
that
his
game
endures
and
what
he
clearly
recognized
was
this
that
no
king
matters
much
as
long
as
your
side
is
playing
a
winning
game
you
can
leave
your
king
in
his
corner
then
to
amuse
himself
in
dignified
unimportance
but
the
minute
you
begin
to
lose
your
king
becomes
a
source
of
anxiety
in
what
is
called
real
life
which
is
only
a
great
game
although
a
mighty
good
one
it
makes
no
difference
what
you
call
your
king
call
him
pope
if
you
want
to
or
president
or
chairman
he
grows
in
importance
in
proportion
as
the
other
side
develops
the
attack
got
to
keep
your
symbol
of
authority
protected
or
you
lose
nevertheless
your
game
is
not
lost
as
long
as
your
king
can
move
that
why
the
men
who
want
to
hurry
up
and
start
a
new
political
era
imprison
kings
and
cut
their
heads
off
with
no
head
on
his
shoulders
your
king
can
only
move
in
the
direction
of
the
cemetery
which
is
over
the
line
and
does
count
i
love
a
good
fight
and
have
been
told
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
it
i
noticed
though
that
the
folk
who
propose
to
elevate
my
morals
fight
just
as
hard
and
less
cleanly
with
their
tongue
than
some
of
us
do
with
our
fists
and
sinews
i
told
too
quite
frequently
that
as
an
american
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
fighting
for
a
king
dear
old
ladies
of
both
sexes
have
assured
me
that
it
is
moral
to
give
aid
and
comfort
to
a
gallant
gentleman
a
godless
mohammedan
too
which
makes
it
much
worse
who
is
striving
gamely
and
without
malice
to
keep
his
given
word
and
save
his
country
but
if
you
got
all
you
want
do
you
know
of
any
better
fun
than
lending
a
hand
while
some
man
you
happen
to
like
gets
his
i
do
of
course
some
fellows
want
too
much
and
it
bad
manners
as
well
as
waste
of
time
to
inflict
your
opinion
on
them
but
given
a
reasonable
purpose
and
a
friend
who
needs
your
assistance
is
there
any
better
sport
on
earth
than
risking
your
own
neck
to
help
him
put
it
over
walk
wide
of
the
man
and
particularly
of
the
woman
who
makes
a
noise
about
lining
your
pocket
or
improving
your
condition
an
altruist
is
my
friend
james
schuyler
grim
but
he
makes
less
noise
than
a
panther
on
a
dark
night
and
i
never
knew
a
man
less
given
to
persuading
you
he
has
one
purpose
but
almost
never
talks
about
it
it
a
sure
bet
that
if
we
had
struck
up
a
close
friendship
sounding
each
other
out
carefully
as
opportunity
occurred
i
would
have
been
in
the
dark
about
it
until
this
minute
all
the
news
of
asia
from
alexandretta
to
the
persian
gulf
and
from
northern
turkestan
to
south
arabia
reaches
grim
ears
sooner
or
later
he
earns
his
bread
and
butter
knitting
all
that
mess
of
information
into
one
intelligible
pattern
after
which
he
interprets
it
and
acts
suddenly
without
advance
notices
time
and
again
he
has
done
better
than
an
army
corps
by
playing
chief
against
chief
in
a
land
where
the
only
law
is
individual
interpretation
of
the
koran
but
it
was
until
our
rescue
of
jeremy
ross
from
near
abu
kem
that
i
ever
heard
grim
come
out
openly
and
admit
that
he
was
working
to
establish
feisul
third
son
of
the
king
of
mecca
as
king
of
just
as
many
arabs
as
might
care
to
have
him
over
them
that
was
the
cat
he
had
been
keeping
in
a
bag
for
seven
years
right
down
to
the
minute
when
grim
jeremy
and
i
sat
down
with
ben
saoud
the
avenger
on
a
stricken
field
at
abu
kem
and
grim
and
jeremy
played
their
hands
so
cleverly
that
the
avenger
was
made
unwitting
guardian
of
jeremy
secret
and
feisul
open
and
sworn
supporter
in
the
bargain
the
heart
of
grim
purpose
continued
to
be
a
mystery
even
to
me
and
i
have
been
as
intimate
with
him
as
any
man
he
doles
out
what
he
has
in
mind
as
grudgingly
as
any
scot
spends
the
shillings
in
his
purse
but
the
scots
are
generous
when
they
have
to
be
and
so
is
grim
there
being
nothing
else
for
it
on
that
occasion
he
spilled
the
beans
the
whole
beans
and
nothing
but
the
beans
having
admitted
us
two
to
his
secret
he
dilated
on
it
all
the
way
back
to
jerusalem
telling
us
all
he
knew
of
feisul
which
would
fill
a
book
and
growing
almost
lyrical
at
times
as
he
related
incidents
in
proof
of
his
contention
that
feisul
lineal
descendant
of
the
prophet
mohammed
is
the
whitest
arab
and
most
gallant
leader
of
his
race
since
saladin
knowing
grim
and
how
carefully
suppressed
his
enthusiasm
usually
is
i
could
help
being
fired
by
all
he
said
on
that
occasion
and
as
for
jeremy
well
it
was
like
meat
and
drink
to
him
you
meet
men
more
or
less
like
jeremy
ross
in
any
of
earth
wild
places
although
you
rarely
meet
his
equal
for
audacity
irreverence
and
riotous
he
is
the
only
australian
by
a
long
shot
who
upholds
australia
by
fist
and
boast
and
astounding
gallantry
yet
stays
away
from
home
you
could
fix
jeremy
with
concrete
he
find
some
means
of
bursting
any
mould
he
had
been
too
long
lost
in
the
heart
of
arabia
for
anything
except
the
thought
of
sydney
bluffs
and
the
homesteads
that
lie
beyond
to
tempt
him
for
the
first
few
days
you
fellers
come
with
me
he
insisted
you
chuck
the
army
grim
and
i
show
you
a
country
where
the
cows
have
to
bend
their
backs
to
let
the
sun
go
down
show
you
women
too
girls
in
sunbonnets
that
look
good
after
the
crows
you
see
out
here
tell
you
what
we
pick
up
the
orient
boat
at
port
said
no
and
for
me
i
a
passenger
aboard
ship
not
a
horrible
example
and
make
a
wake
for
the
bull
kid
murder
wo
the
scoff
taste
good
we
hit
the
bull
kid
hard
for
about
a
week
mix
it
with
the
fellers
in
from
way
back
you
know
pearlers
spending
it
easy
handing
their
money
to
bessie
behind
the
bar
and
restless
because
she
makes
it
last
too
long
watch
them
a
while
and
get
in
touch
with
all
that
happening
then
flit
out
of
sydney
like
bats
out
of
and
hump
blue
eh
something
turn
up
it
always
does
i
got
money
in
the
bank
about
two
thousand
here
in
gold
dust
with
me
and
if
what
you
true
grim
about
me
still
being
a
trooper
then
the
army
owes
me
three
years
back
pay
and
i
have
it
or
go
to
buckingham
palace
and
tear
off
a
piece
of
the
king
we
capitalists
by
jupiter
besides
you
fellers
agreed
that
if
i
shut
down
the
mine
at
abu
kem
you
join
me
and
we
be
grim
ramsden
and
ross
i
keep
the
bargain
if
you
hold
me
to
it
when
the
time
comes
grim
answered
you
bet
i
hold
you
to
it
rammy
here
and
you
and
i
could
trade
the
chosen
people
off
the
map
between
us
we
a
combination
what
time
got
to
do
with
it
we
got
to
use
your
mine
grim
answered
i
game
but
let
see
australia
first
suppose
we
fix
up
your
discharge
and
you
go
home
grim
suggested
come
back
when
you
had
a
vacation
and
by
that
time
ramsden
and
i
will
have
done
what
possible
for
feisul
he
in
damascus
now
but
the
french
have
got
him
backed
into
a
corner
no
money
not
much
ammunition
french
propaganda
undermining
the
allegiance
of
his
men
time
working
against
him
and
nothing
to
do
but
wait
what
in
hell
have
the
french
got
to
do
with
it
they
want
syria
they
got
the
coast
towns
now
they
mean
to
have
damascus
and
if
they
can
catch
feisul
and
jail
him
to
keep
him
out
of
mischief
they
will
but
damn
it
did
they
promise
the
arabs
that
feisul
should
be
king
of
syria
palestine
mesopotamia
and
all
that
they
did
the
allies
all
promised
france
included
but
since
the
armistice
the
british
have
made
a
present
of
palestine
to
the
jews
and
the
french
have
demanded
syria
for
themselves
the
british
are
but
the
french
do
want
him
anywhere
except
dead
or
in
jail
they
know
they
given
him
and
the
arabs
a
raw
deal
and
they
seem
to
think
the
simplest
way
out
is
to
blacken
feisul
character
and
ditch
him
if
the
french
once
catch
him
in
damascus
he
done
for
and
the
arab
cause
is
lost
why
lost
demanded
jeremy
there
are
plenty
more
arabs
but
only
one
feisul
he
the
only
man
who
can
unite
them
all
i
know
a
chance
for
him
said
jeremy
let
him
come
with
us
three
to
australia
there
are
thousands
of
fellers
there
who
fought
alongside
him
and
do
care
a
damn
for
the
french
they
raise
all
the
hell
there
is
before
they
see
him
ditched
london
the
place
for
him
grim
answered
the
british
like
him
and
they
ashamed
of
the
way
he
been
treated
they
give
him
mesopotamia
baghdad
the
old
arab
capital
and
that
do
for
a
beginning
after
that
it
up
to
the
arabs
themselves
well
where
does
my
gold
mine
come
in
jeremy
asked
feisul
has
no
money
if
it
was
made
clear
to
him
that
he
could
serve
the
arabs
best
by
going
to
london
he
consider
it
the
objection
would
be
though
that
he
have
to
make
terms
in
advance
with
who
work
through
the
foreign
office
to
tie
up
all
the
oil
and
mine
and
irrigation
concessions
if
we
tell
him
privately
about
your
gold
mine
at
abu
kem
he
can
laugh
at
financiers
all
right
said
jeremy
i
give
him
the
gold
mine
let
him
erect
a
modern
plant
and
he
have
millions
keep
the
mine
secret
let
him
go
to
london
and
arrange
about
mespot
just
at
present
high
finance
could
find
a
hundred
ways
of
disputing
his
title
to
the
mine
but
once
he
king
with
the
arabs
all
rooting
for
him
things
be
different
he
treat
you
right
when
that
time
comes
do
worry
worry
me
said
jeremy
all
that
worries
me
is
having
to
see
this
business
through
before
we
can
make
a
wake
for
sydney
i
homesick
but
never
mind
all
right
you
fellers
i
make
one
to
give
this
feisul
boy
a
hoist
chapter
ii
atcha
jimgrim
sahib
atcha
that
conversation
and
jeremy
conversion
to
the
big
idea
took
place
on
the
way
across
the
desert
to
jerusalem
a
journey
that
took
us
a
week
on
a
rowdy
hot
journey
with
the
stifling
simoom
blowing
grit
into
our
followers
throats
who
sang
and
argued
alternately
nevertheless
for
besides
our
old
ali
baba
and
his
sixteen
sons
and
grandsons
there
were
jeremy
ten
pickups
from
arabia
byways
whom
he
could
leave
behind
because
they
knew
the
secret
of
his
grim
authority
is
always
at
its
height
on
the
outbound
trail
for
then
everybody
knows
that
success
and
even
safety
depends
on
his
swift
thinking
on
the
way
home
afterward
reaction
sets
in
sometimes
because
arabs
are
made
by
success
and
it
is
a
simple
matter
to
discipline
free
men
when
you
have
no
obvious
hold
over
them
but
that
was
where
jeremy
came
in
jeremy
could
do
tricks
and
the
arabs
were
like
children
when
he
performed
for
them
they
would
be
good
if
he
would
make
one
live
chicken
into
two
live
ones
by
pulling
it
apart
they
would
pitch
the
tents
without
fighting
if
he
would
swallow
a
dozen
eggs
and
produce
them
presently
from
under
a
camel
tail
if
he
would
turn
on
his
ventriloquism
and
make
a
camel
say
its
prayers
they
were
willing
to
forgive
for
the
moment
anyhow
even
their
nearest
enemies
so
we
became
a
sort
of
travelling
sideshow
with
jeremy
ballyhooing
for
himself
in
an
amazing
flow
of
colloquial
arabic
and
hardly
ever
repeating
the
same
trick
all
of
which
was
very
good
for
our
crowd
and
convenient
at
the
moment
but
hardly
so
good
for
jeremy
equilibrium
he
is
one
of
those
handsome
perpetually
youthful
fellows
whose
heads
have
been
a
wee
mite
turned
by
the
sunshine
of
the
world
warm
smile
i
do
mean
by
that
that
he
is
a
tophole
man
or
a
friend
with
guts
and
gumption
who
would
chance
his
neck
for
anyone
he
likes
without
a
second
hesitation
for
he
every
bit
of
that
he
has
horse
sense
too
and
is
fooled
by
the
sort
of
flattery
that
women
lavish
on
men
who
have
laughing
eyes
and
a
little
dark
moustache
but
he
has
been
yet
in
a
predicament
that
he
could
laugh
or
fight
his
way
out
of
he
has
never
yet
found
a
job
that
he
cared
to
stick
at
for
more
than
a
year
or
two
and
seldom
one
that
could
hold
him
for
six
months
he
jumps
from
one
thing
to
another
finding
all
the
world
so
interesting
and
amusing
and
most
folk
so
ready
to
make
friends
with
him
that
he
always
feels
sure
of
landing
softly
somewhere
over
the
horizon
so
by
the
time
we
reached
jerusalem
friend
jeremy
was
ripe
for
almost
anything
except
the
plan
we
had
agreed
on
having
talked
that
over
pretty
steadily
most
of
the
way
from
abu
kem
it
seemed
already
about
as
stale
and
unattractive
to
him
as
some
of
his
oldest
tricks
and
jerusalem
provided
plenty
of
distraction
we
had
been
in
quarters
half
an
hour
when
jeremy
was
up
to
his
ears
in
a
dispute
that
looked
like
separating
us
grim
who
wears
his
arab
clothes
from
preference
and
never
gets
into
uniform
if
he
can
help
it
went
straight
to
the
telephone
to
report
briefly
to
headquarters
i
took
jeremy
upstairs
to
discard
my
indian
disguise
and
hunt
out
clothes
for
jeremy
that
would
fit
him
but
found
none
i
being
nearly
as
heavy
as
grim
and
jeremy
together
he
had
finished
clowning
in
the
kit
i
offered
him
and
had
got
back
into
his
arab
things
while
i
was
shaving
off
the
black
whiskers
with
which
nature
adorns
my
face
whenever
i
neglect
the
razor
for
a
few
days
when
an
auto
came
tooting
and
roaring
down
the
narrow
street
and
a
moment
later
three
staff
officers
took
the
stairs
at
a
run
so
far
good
that
was
unofficial
human
and
entirely
decent
the
three
of
them
burst
through
the
bed
room
door
all
grins
and
took
turns
pumping
with
jeremy
right
arm
glad
to
see
him
proud
to
know
him
pleased
to
see
him
looking
fit
and
well
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
even
men
who
had
fought
all
through
the
war
had
forgotten
some
of
its
red
tape
by
that
time
and
jeremy
not
being
in
uniform
they
treated
him
like
a
fellow
human
being
and
he
reciprocated
australian
fashion
free
and
easy
throwing
up
his
long
legs
on
my
bed
and
yelling
for
somebody
to
bring
drinks
for
the
crowd
while
they
showered
questions
on
him
it
was
until
jeremy
turned
the
tables
and
began
to
question
them
that
the
first
cloud
showed
itself
say
old
top
he
demanded
of
a
man
who
wore
the
crossed
swords
of
a
brigadier
grim
tells
me
i
a
trooper
when
can
i
get
my
discharge
the
effect
was
instantaneous
you
would
have
thought
they
had
touched
a
leper
by
the
way
they
drew
themselves
up
and
changed
face
never
thought
of
that
oh
i
say
this
is
a
complication
you
mean
i
mean
this
jeremy
answered
dryly
because
nobody
could
have
helped
notice
their
change
of
attitude
i
was
made
prisoner
by
arabs
and
carried
off
that
more
than
three
years
ago
the
war
over
grim
tells
me
all
australians
have
been
sent
home
and
discharged
what
about
me
ah
this
will
have
to
be
considered
let
see
to
whom
did
you
surrender
damn
you
i
did
surrender
i
met
grim
in
the
desert
and
reported
to
him
for
duty
met
major
grim
eh
yes
said
grim
appearing
in
the
door
i
came
across
him
in
the
desert
he
reported
for
duty
i
gave
him
an
order
and
he
obeyed
it
everything
regular
how
you
make
that
out
regular
have
you
any
proof
he
was
a
deserter
he
have
to
be
charged
with
desertion
and
tried
by
court
martial
i
afraid
possibly
a
mere
formality
but
it
have
to
be
done
you
know
before
he
can
be
given
a
clear
discharge
if
he
ca
be
proved
guilty
of
desertion
he
be
cleared
how
long
will
that
take
jeremy
demanded
his
voice
rang
sharp
with
the
challenge
note
that
means
debate
has
ceased
and
quarrel
started
it
is
the
right
note
for
dissolving
difficulties
could
tell
you
said
the
brigadier
my
advice
to
you
is
to
keep
yourself
as
inconspicuous
as
possible
until
the
administrator
gets
back
it
was
good
advice
but
grim
standing
behind
the
brigadier
made
signals
to
jeremy
in
vain
few
australians
talk
peace
when
there
is
no
peace
and
when
there
a
fight
in
prospect
they
like
to
get
it
over
i
remember
you
said
jeremy
speaking
rather
slowly
and
throwing
in
a
little
catchy
laugh
that
was
like
a
heard
through
a
microphone
you
were
the
fusileer
major
they
lent
to
the
jordan
highlanders
fine
force
that
no
advance
without
security
lost
two
men
if
i
remember
snakebite
one
the
other
shot
for
looting
am
i
right
so
they
made
you
a
brigadier
are
you
the
staff
officer
they
sent
to
strafe
a
regiment
of
anzacs
for
going
into
action
without
orders
we
chased
you
to
cover
i
can
see
you
now
running
for
fear
we
shoot
you
hah
grim
took
the
only
course
possible
in
the
circumstances
the
brigadier
neck
was
crimson
and
jeremy
had
to
be
saved
somehow
touch
of
sun
sir
that
and
hardship
have
unhinged
him
a
bit
suffers
from
delusions
suppose
i
keep
him
here
until
the
doctor
sees
him
ah
yes
you
better
see
he
gets
no
whisky
will
you
too
bad
too
bad
what
a
pity
our
three
visitors
left
in
a
hurry
contriving
to
look
devilish
important
grim
followed
them
out
rammy
old
cock
said
jeremy
sprawling
on
the
bed
again
and
laughing
do
look
all
that
serious
bring
back
your
brigadier
and
i
kiss
him
on
both
cheeks
while
you
hold
him
but
say
suppose
that
one
of
these
swabs
who
serve
out
number
nine
pills
for
broken
leg
dyspepsia
housemaid
knee
and
the
creeping
itch
suppose
he
swears
i
luny
what
then
grim
will
find
somebody
to
swear
to
anything
once
i
answered
but
you
look
altogether
too
dashed
healthy
got
to
give
the
a
chance
here
get
between
the
sheets
and
kid
that
something
hurts
you
get
out
the
doc
put
a
splint
on
it
and
order
me
into
a
hospital
how
about
toothache
that
do
do
they
give
you
bread
and
water
for
it
so
toothache
was
selected
as
an
alibi
and
jeremy
wrapped
his
jaw
in
a
towel
after
jabbing
his
cheek
with
a
pin
so
as
to
remember
on
which
side
the
pain
should
be
but
it
was
artifice
wasted
for
grim
had
turned
a
better
trick
he
had
found
an
australian
doctor
in
the
hospital
for
sikhs
the
only
other
australian
in
jerusalem
just
then
and
brought
him
upstairs
in
a
way
that
proved
he
knew
the
whole
story
already
the
autopsy
as
he
called
it
was
a
riot
we
did
talk
of
anything
but
fights
at
gaza
the
surprise
at
nazareth
when
the
german
general
staff
fled
up
the
road
on
foot
in
its
pyjamas
the
scrap
at
nebi
samwil
when
australians
and
turks
took
and
retook
the
same
hill
half
a
dozen
times
and
parched
enemies
took
turns
drinking
from
one
flask
while
the
shells
of
both
sides
burst
above
them
it
seems
to
have
been
almost
like
war
in
palestine
from
their
account
of
it
either
side
conceding
that
the
other
played
the
game
when
they
had
thrashed
the
whole
campaign
over
from
start
to
finish
making
maps
on
my
bed
with
hair
brushes
razors
and
things
they
got
to
talking
of
australia
and
that
was
all
about
fighting
too
dog
fights
fist
fights
between
bullockies
on
the
long
road
from
northern
queensland
riots
in
perth
when
the
pearlers
came
in
off
the
barrier
reef
to
spend
their
pay
rows
in
the
big
shearing
sheds
when
the
union
men
objected
to
unskilled
labour
you
have
thought
australia
was
one
big
battlefield
with
nothing
else
but
fights
worth
talking
of
from
dawn
till
dark
the
doctor
was
one
of
those
little
men
with
large
freckles
and
brown
eyes
who
surprise
you
with
a
mixture
of
intense
domestic
virtue
and
a
capacity
that
should
mix
with
it
at
all
for
turning
up
in
all
the
unexpected
places
you
meet
his
sort
everywhere
and
they
always
have
a
wife
along
who
worships
them
and
makes
a
home
out
of
tin
cans
and
that
would
put
the
housekeepers
to
shame
they
always
have
a
picture
on
the
wall
of
cows
standing
in
the
water
and
no
matter
what
their
circumstances
are
there
always
something
in
reserve
for
guests
offered
frankly
without
apology
never
hesitate
with
those
folk
but
do
let
them
go
too
far
for
they
beggar
themselves
to
help
you
in
a
tight
place
if
you
let
them
ticknor
his
name
was
he
a
good
man
say
grim
there
a
case
in
the
sikh
hospital
that
ought
to
interest
you
he
said
at
last
fellow
from
damascus
arab
one
of
crowd
he
would
let
them
take
him
to
the
zionist
hospital
swore
a
jew
knifed
him
and
that
the
others
would
finish
the
job
if
they
got
half
a
chance
they
have
been
arguing
yet
and
he
dead
and
buried
if
i
had
gone
shopping
with
mabel
she
saw
the
crowd
first
i
was
in
noureddin
store
and
jabbed
her
way
in
with
her
umbrella
she
yelled
to
me
and
i
bucked
the
line
the
jews
wanted
to
tell
me
i
had
no
right
to
take
that
chap
to
the
sikh
hospital
and
no
more
had
i
so
i
plugged
him
up
a
bit
and
put
him
in
a
cab
and
let
him
take
himself
there
mabel
and
me
beside
him
seeing
i
was
paying
for
the
cab
i
did
see
why
mabel
should
walk
of
course
once
we
had
him
in
there
he
was
too
sick
to
be
moved
but
the
army
wo
pay
for
him
so
i
sent
a
bill
to
the
zionists
and
they
returned
it
with
a
rude
remark
on
the
margin
maybe
i
can
get
the
money
out
of
feisul
some
day
otherwise
i
stuck
i
settle
that
said
grim
what
the
tune
he
plays
utter
mystery
swears
a
jew
stabbed
him
but
that
damascus
outfit
blame
the
jews
for
everything
he
only
just
down
from
damascus
i
think
he
one
of
feisul
officers
although
he
not
in
uniform
on
a
secret
mission
suppose
you
go
and
see
him
but
say
watch
out
for
the
doc
on
duty
he
a
meddler
tell
him
nothing
sure
how
about
jeremy
what
the
verdict
what
do
you
want
done
with
him
i
want
him
out
of
reach
of
trouble
here
pending
his
discharge
no
need
to
certify
him
mad
is
there
mad
all
australians
are
mad
none
of
us
need
a
certificate
for
that
have
you
arrested
him
not
yet
then
you
too
late
he
suffering
from
bad
food
and
exposure
the
air
of
jerusalem
bad
for
him
and
he
liable
to
get
pugnacious
if
argued
with
that
runs
in
the
blood
i
order
him
off
duty
and
shall
recommend
him
within
twenty
minutes
to
the
for
leave
of
absence
at
his
own
expense
if
you
know
of
any
general
who
dares
override
the
i
show
you
a
brass
hat
in
the
wind
come
on
want
to
bet
on
it
will
the
fall
asked
grim
like
a
new
chum
off
a
brumby
signs
anything
i
shove
under
his
nose
comes
round
to
our
house
to
eat
mabel
damper
and
syrup
three
nights
a
week
you
bet
he
sign
it
besides
he
white
pulled
out
of
the
by
an
australian
at
gaza
and
has
forgotten
it
sign
anything
but
checks
to
help
an
anzac
i
be
going
you
trot
up
to
the
grim
and
interview
that
arab
sidi
bin
forget
his
name
he
lies
in
number
nineteen
cot
on
the
side
of
the
long
ward
next
to
a
pathan
who
shy
both
legs
you
ca
mistake
him
i
write
out
a
medical
certificate
for
jeremy
and
follow
and
say
wait
a
minute
what
price
the
lot
of
you
eating
mabel
chow
tonight
at
our
house
we
do
keep
a
cook
so
you
wo
get
poisoned
that
settled
i
tell
mabel
you
coming
tootleloo
but
there
was
a
chance
that
the
brigadier
might
carry
resentment
to
the
point
of
sending
up
a
guard
to
arrest
jeremy
on
the
principle
that
a
bird
in
the
hand
can
be
strafed
more
easily
than
one
with
a
medical
certificate
the
bush
was
the
place
for
our
bird
until
such
time
as
the
signature
should
adorn
the
necessary
piece
of
paper
so
we
three
rode
up
in
a
cab
together
to
the
sikh
hospital
and
had
a
rare
time
trying
to
get
in
you
see
there
was
a
sikh
on
guard
outside
who
respected
nothing
under
heaven
but
his
orders
he
would
have
known
grim
in
any
event
being
only
recently
from
india
grim
uniform
would
have
passed
him
in
but
he
and
jeremy
were
still
arrayed
as
arabs
and
my
civilian
clothes
entitled
me
in
the
sentry
opinion
to
protection
lest
i
commit
the
heinous
sin
of
impertinence
an
arab
in
his
eyes
was
as
an
insect
and
a
white
man
who
consorted
with
such
creatures
not
a
person
to
be
taken
seriously
but
our
friend
narayan
singh
was
in
the
hospital
enjoying
the
wise
veteran
prerogative
of
resting
on
full
pay
after
his
strenuous
adventures
along
with
us
at
abu
kem
there
was
nothing
whatever
the
matter
with
him
he
recognized
grim
voice
and
emerged
through
the
front
door
with
a
smile
flashing
in
the
midst
of
black
hair
dignified
immense
and
full
of
instant
understanding
grim
said
a
few
words
to
narayan
singh
in
arabic
which
so
far
as
the
sentry
was
concerned
was
a
language
but
narayan
singh
spoke
in
turn
in
punjabi
and
the
man
just
out
from
india
began
to
droop
like
gourd
under
the
old
soldier
scorn
in
consequence
we
got
a
full
salute
with
arms
presented
and
walked
in
without
having
to
trouble
anybody
in
authority
narayan
singh
leading
with
the
air
of
an
butler
showing
royalty
to
their
rooms
he
even
ascertained
in
an
aside
that
the
doctor
of
the
day
was
busy
operating
and
broke
that
good
news
with
consummate
tact
the
sahibs
lightest
wish
is
law
but
if
they
should
wish
to
speak
with
the
doctor
sahib
it
would
be
necessary
to
call
him
forth
from
the
surgery
where
he
works
behind
locked
doors
is
it
desired
that
i
should
summon
him
operation
serious
asked
grim
and
neither
man
smiled
it
was
perfect
acting
very
sahib
he
removes
the
half
of
a
sepoy
liver
uh
could
think
of
interrupting
him
too
bad
lead
the
way
but
we
did
enter
the
ward
until
narayan
singh
and
an
orderly
had
placed
two
screens
around
number
nineteen
cot
in
the
way
they
do
when
a
man
is
dying
and
had
placed
three
chairs
at
the
bedside
contrary
to
the
regulations
printed
on
the
wall
then
narayan
singh
stood
on
guard
outside
the
screens
but
did
miss
much
of
the
conversation
i
believe
the
man
in
bed
was
wounded
badly
but
not
fatally
and
though
his
eyes
blazed
with
fever
he
seemed
to
have
some
of
his
wits
about
him
he
recognized
grim
after
staring
hard
at
him
for
about
a
minute
jimgrim
sidi
bin
tagim
is
it
well
well
i
thought
it
might
be
you
said
grim
speaking
the
northern
dialect
of
arabic
which
differs
quite
a
bit
from
that
spoken
around
jerusalem
who
are
these
asked
the
man
in
bed
speaking
hoarsely
as
he
stared
first
at
jeremy
and
then
at
me
jmil
ras
a
friend
of
mine
grim
answered
and
that
one
he
did
like
the
look
of
me
at
all
western
clothes
and
a
shaven
face
spell
nothing
reassuring
to
the
arab
when
in
trouble
he
has
been
helped
by
the
foreigner
a
time
or
two
too
often
an
american
named
ramsden
also
a
friend
of
mine
oh
an
amirikani
a
hakim
no
not
a
doctor
not
a
man
to
fear
he
is
a
friend
of
feisul
on
whose
word
mine
grim
answered
sidi
bin
tagim
nodded
he
seemed
willing
to
take
grim
word
for
anything
why
did
you
say
a
jew
stabbed
you
grim
asked
suddenly
so
that
they
might
hang
a
jew
or
two
wallah
are
the
jews
not
at
the
bottom
of
all
trouble
if
a
greek
should
kill
a
maltese
it
would
be
a
jew
who
planned
it
may
the
curse
of
allah
change
their
faces
and
the
fire
of
eblis
consume
them
did
you
see
the
man
who
stabbed
you
yes
and
was
he
a
jew
jimgrim
you
know
better
than
to
ask
that
a
jew
always
hires
another
to
do
the
killing
he
who
struck
me
was
a
hireling
who
shall
die
by
my
hand
as
allah
is
my
witness
but
may
allah
do
more
to
me
and
bring
me
down
into
the
dust
unburied
unless
i
make
ten
jews
pay
for
this
any
one
jew
in
particular
grim
asked
and
the
man
in
bed
closed
up
like
a
clam
that
has
been
touched
he
was
a
fellow
rather
like
one
of
those
lean
spaniards
whom
goya
used
to
paint
with
a
scant
beard
turning
grey
and
hollow
cheeks
he
had
thrown
off
the
grey
army
blanket
because
fever
burned
him
and
his
lean
hard
muscles
stood
out
as
if
cast
in
bronze
but
for
the
jews
feisul
would
be
king
of
all
this
land
this
minute
he
said
suddenly
and
closed
up
tight
again
grim
smiled
he
nearly
always
does
smile
when
apparently
at
a
loose
end
at
moments
when
most
would
browbeat
he
grows
sympathetic
humours
his
man
and
by
following
whatever
detour
offers
gets
back
on
the
trail
again
how
about
the
french
he
asked
may
allah
smite
them
they
are
all
in
the
pay
of
jews
can
you
prove
it
wallah
that
i
can
grim
looked
incredulous
those
baffling
eyes
of
his
twinkled
with
quiet
amusement
and
the
man
in
bed
resented
it
you
laugh
jimgrim
but
if
you
would
listen
i
might
tell
you
something
but
grim
only
smiled
more
broadly
than
ever
sidi
bin
tagim
you
one
of
those
fanatics
who
think
the
world
is
all
leagued
against
you
why
should
the
jews
think
you
sufficiently
important
to
be
murdered
wallah
there
are
few
who
hold
the
reins
of
happenings
as
i
do
if
they
killed
you
they
have
stopped
the
clock
eh
that
is
as
allah
may
determine
i
am
not
dead
have
you
friends
in
jerusalem
surely
strange
that
they
have
been
to
see
you
wallah
not
strange
at
all
i
see
they
regard
you
as
a
man
without
authority
who
might
make
trouble
and
leave
other
men
to
face
it
eh
who
says
i
have
no
authority
well
if
you
could
prove
you
have
what
then
the
man
in
bed
demanded
trying
to
sit
up
feisul
for
instance
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
these
men
with
me
are
his
friends
too
you
have
no
letter
of
course
for
that
would
be
dangerous
jimgrim
in
the
name
of
the
most
high
i
swear
i
had
a
letter
he
who
stabbed
me
took
it
i
was
the
letter
from
feisul
malaish
no
matter
it
was
sealed
and
bore
a
number
for
the
signature
if
you
can
get
that
letter
for
me
jimgrim
but
what
is
the
use
you
are
a
servant
of
the
british
tell
me
who
stabbed
you
and
i
get
you
the
letter
no
for
you
are
clever
you
would
learn
too
much
better
tell
the
doctor
of
this
place
to
hurry
up
and
heal
me
then
i
will
attend
to
my
own
affairs
i
like
to
keep
you
out
of
jail
if
that
possible
grim
answered
you
and
i
are
old
acquaintances
sidi
bin
tagim
but
of
course
if
you
here
to
sow
sedition
and
should
there
be
a
document
at
large
in
proof
of
it
which
document
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
police
well
i
could
do
much
for
you
then
you
better
tell
me
who
stabbed
you
and
i
get
after
him
ah
but
if
you
get
the
letter
i
shall
read
it
of
course
but
to
whom
will
you
show
it
perhaps
to
my
friends
here
are
they
bound
by
your
honour
i
shall
hold
them
so
there
was
the
glint
in
grim
eye
now
that
should
warn
anyone
who
knew
him
that
the
scent
was
hot
added
to
the
fact
that
the
rest
of
his
expression
suggested
waning
interest
that
look
of
his
forebode
fine
hunting
there
one
other
i
might
consult
he
admitted
casually
on
my
way
here
i
saw
one
of
feisul
staff
captains
driving
in
a
cab
toward
the
jaffa
gate
the
instant
effect
of
that
remark
was
to
throw
the
wounded
man
into
a
paroxysm
of
mingled
rage
and
fear
he
almost
threw
a
fit
his
already
bloodless
face
grew
ashy
grey
and
livid
blue
alternately
and
he
would
have
screamed
at
grim
if
the
cough
that
began
to
rack
his
whole
body
would
have
let
him
as
it
was
he
gasped
out
unintelligible
words
and
sought
to
make
grim
understand
by
signs
and
grim
apparently
did
understand
very
well
he
laughed
tell
me
who
stabbed
you
and
i
wo
mention
your
name
to
abd
el
kadir
and
these
men
will
they
say
nothing
not
a
word
who
stabbed
you
yussuf
dakmar
may
allah
cut
him
off
from
love
and
mercy
golly
exploded
jeremy
forgetting
not
to
talk
english
there
a
swine
for
you
yussuf
dakmar
the
son
of
a
who
used
to
sell
sheep
to
the
army
four
times
over
drive
into
camp
and
get
a
receipt
drive
out
again
next
night
bring
back
in
the
morning
get
a
receipt
again
drive
off
bring
back
us
chaps
too
busy
shifting
brother
turk
to
cotton
on
he
be
the
boy
i
kicked
out
of
camp
once
maybe
remembers
it
too
i
bet
his
backbone
twanging
yet
lead
me
to
him
grim
old
cock
i
like
another
piece
of
him
but
grim
was
humming
to
himself
playing
piano
on
the
with
his
fingers
is
that
man
not
an
arab
asked
the
fellow
in
bed
taking
alarm
all
over
again
arab
your
aunt
laughed
jeremy
i
eat
arabs
i
the
only
original
genuine
woolly
bad
man
from
way
back
i
the
plumber
who
pulled
the
plug
out
of
arabia
you
know
english
good
you
know
what
a
dose
of
salts
is
then
you
seen
it
work
experienced
it
maybe
hah
you
understand
me
i
a
grain
of
the
epsom
salt
that
went
through
beersheba
time
the
turks
had
all
the
booze
in
sight
and
we
were
thirsty
muddy
booze
it
was
too
oozy
booze
not
fit
for
washing
hogs
ever
heard
of
anzacs
well
i
one
of
now
you
know
what
the
scorpion
who
stung
you
up
against
you
lie
there
and
think
about
it
cocky
i
show
you
his
shirt
tomorrow
morning
suppose
we
go
now
suggested
grim
i
got
the
drift
of
this
thing
get
the
rest
elsewhere
you
can
fan
that
joskins
for
a
lot
more
yet
jeremy
objected
the
plug
pulled
he
flow
if
you
let
him
grim
nodded
sure
he
would
do
want
too
much
from
him
do
want
to
have
to
arrest
him
get
me
come
on
then
answered
jeremy
i
promised
him
a
shirt
beyond
the
screen
narayan
singh
stood
like
a
statue
deaf
dumb
immovable
even
his
eyes
were
fixed
with
a
blank
stare
on
the
wall
opposite
how
much
did
you
hear
grim
asked
him
i
sahib
i
am
a
sick
man
i
have
been
asleep
dream
anything
as
your
honour
pleases
hospital
stuffy
is
it
think
you
could
recover
health
more
rapidly
outdoors
continued
of
course
but
how
about
a
little
exercise
the
sikh
eyes
twinkled
sahib
you
know
i
need
exercise
i
speak
to
the
doctor
for
you
in
case
he
signs
a
new

hum
dekta
hai
like
most
of
the
quarters
occupied
by
british
officers
the
house
occupied
by
major
roger
ticknor
and
his
wife
mabel
was
enemy
property
and
its
only
virtue
consisted
in
its
being
rent
free
grim
jeremy
little
ticknor
and
his
smaller
wife
and
i
sat
facing
across
a
small
deal
table
with
a
stuttering
between
us
in
a
house
not
far
away
some
orthodox
jews
arrayed
in
purple
and
green
and
orange
with
around
the
edges
of
their
hats
were
drunk
and
celebrating
noisily
the
feast
of
esther
so
you
can
work
out
the
exact
date
if
you
curious
enough
the
time
was
nine
we
had
talked
the
anzac
through
palestine
all
over
again
from
the
beginning
taking
names
in
vain
and
doing
honour
to
others
that
will
stay
unsung
for
lack
of
recognition
when
one
of
those
unaccountable
pauses
came
and
for
the
sake
of
breaking
silence
mabel
ticknor
asked
a
question
she
was
a
little
plucky
thing
whom
you
called
instinctively
by
her
first
name
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
a
sort
of
little
mother
of
men
who
can
make
silk
purses
out
of
ears
and
would
know
how
to
brag
if
she
were
tempted
say
jim
she
asked
turning
her
head
quickly
like
a
bird
toward
grim
on
my
left
what
your
verdict
about
that
man
from
syria
that
roger
took
in
a
cab
to
the
sikh
hospital
i
out
a
new
pair
of
riding
breeches
if
roger
has
to
pay
the
bill
for
him
i
want
my
money
worth
tell
me
his
story
go
ahead
and
buy
the
breeches
mabel
i
settle
that
bill
he
answered
no
you
wo
jim
you
always
squandering
money
half
your
pay
goes
to
the
scallywags
you
landed
in
jail
this
one
up
to
roger
and
me
we
found
him
grim
laughed
i
can
charge
his
keep
under
the
head
of
paid
for
i
shall
sign
the
voucher
without
a
qualm
you
get
blood
out
of
a
stone
jim
go
on
tell
us
i
hired
to
keep
secrets
as
well
as
discover
them
grim
answered
smiling
broadly
of
course
you
are
she
retorted
but
i
know
all
roger
secrets
and
he
a
doctor
mind
you
am
i
right
roger
come
along
there
are
no
servants
no
eavesdroppers
wait
i
put
tea
on
the
table
and
then
we
all
listen
she
made
tea
australian
fashion
in
a
billy
which
is
quick
and
simple
but
causes
alleged
dyspepsia
cures
to
sell
well
all
the
way
from
adelaide
to
the
gulf
of
carpentraia
you
have
to
tell
her
jim
said
jeremy
mabel
safe
as
an
iron
roof
put
in
her
husband
noisy
in
the
rain
but
does
leak
but
neither
man
nor
woman
could
have
extracted
a
story
from
james
schuyler
grim
unless
it
suited
him
to
tell
it
mabel
ticknor
is
one
of
those
honest
little
women
who
carry
men
secrets
with
them
up
and
down
the
world
being
confided
in
by
nearly
every
man
who
met
her
was
a
habit
but
grim
tells
only
when
the
telling
may
accomplish
something
and
i
wondered
as
he
laid
his
elbow
on
the
table
to
begin
just
what
use
he
meant
to
make
of
mabel
ticknor
he
uses
what
he
knows
as
other
men
use
coin
spending
thriftily
for
fair
advantage
that
is
secret
he
began
as
soon
as
mabel
had
dumped
the
contents
of
the
billy
into
a
huge
brown
teapot
i
expect
narayan
singh
here
presently
he
have
a
letter
with
him
taken
from
the
syrian
who
stabbed
that
man
in
the
hospital
whoa
hoss
jeremy
interrupted
you
mean
you
sent
that
sikh
to
get
the
shirt
of
yussuf
dakmar
grim
nodded
that
was
my
job
jeremy
objected
whoa
hoss
yourself
jeremy
grim
answered
you
have
gone
down
into
the
bazaar
like
a
bull
into
a
narayan
singh
knows
where
to
find
him
if
he
shows
fight
he
be
simply
handed
over
to
the
sikh
patrol
for
attacking
a
man
in
uniform
and
by
the
time
he
reaches
the
that
letter
will
be
here
on
the
table
between
us
all
the
same
that
a
lark
you
done
me
out
of
jeremy
insisted
that
yussuf
dakmar
a
stinker
i
know
all
about
him
two
whole
squadrons
had
to
eat
lousy
biscuit
for
a
week
because
that
swab
sold
the
same
meat
five
times
over
but
i
get
him
yet
well
as
i
was
saying
grim
resumed
there
a
letter
in
jerusalem
that
supposed
to
be
from
feisul
but
when
feisul
writes
anything
he
signs
his
name
to
it
whereas
a
number
is
the
signature
on
this
now
that
fellow
sidi
bin
tagim
in
the
hospital
is
an
honest
old
kite
in
his
way
he
a
great
rooter
for
feisul
and
the
only
easy
way
to
ditch
a
man
like
feisul
who
as
honest
as
the
day
is
long
and
no
man
fool
is
to
convince
his
fanatical
admirers
that
for
his
own
sake
he
ought
to
be
forced
along
a
certain
course
the
game
as
old
as
adam
you
fill
up
a
man
like
sidi
bin
tagim
with
tales
about
jews
convince
him
that
jews
stand
between
feisul
and
a
kingdom
and
he
lend
a
hand
in
any
scheme
ostensibly
directed
against
jews
get
me
so
would
i
swore
jeremy
i
against
too
i
camped
alongside
the
jordan
highlanders
one
time
when
but
we
had
had
that
story
twice
that
evening
with
variations
he
was
balancing
his
chair
on
two
legs
so
i
pushed
him
over
backward
and
before
he
could
pick
himself
up
again
grim
resumed
feisul
is
in
damascus
and
the
syrian
convention
has
proclaimed
him
king
that
do
suit
the
french
who
detest
him
the
mutual
when
feisul
went
to
paris
for
the
peace
conference
the
french
imagined
he
was
easy
they
thought
here
another
of
these
eastern
princes
who
can
be
taken
in
the
old
trap
so
they
staged
a
special
performance
at
the
opera
for
him
and
invited
him
to
supper
afterward
behind
the
scenes
with
the
usual
sort
of
ladies
in
full
in
attendance
shall
we
cut
that
too
suggested
mabel
sure
feisul
did
he
not
that
kind
of
moth
ever
since
then
the
french
have
declared
he
a
hypocrite
and
because
he
wo
yield
his
rights
they
been
busy
inventing
wrongs
of
their
own
and
insisting
on
immediate
adjustment
the
french
have
left
one
stone
unturned
that
could
irritate
feisul
into
making
a
false
move
to
hell
with
them
suggested
jeremy
reaching
for
more
tea
but
feisul
not
easy
to
irritate
grim
went
on
he
one
of
those
rare
men
who
get
born
once
in
an
epoch
who
force
you
to
believe
that
virtue
is
extinct
he
almost
like
a
child
in
some
things
like
a
good
woman
in
others
and
a
man
of
iron
courage
all
the
time
who
can
fire
arabs
in
the
same
way
saladin
did
five
centuries
ago
he
looks
like
a
saint
said
jeremy
i
seen
him
but
he
no
soft
liver
continued
grim
he
was
brought
up
in
the
desert
among
bedouins
and
has
their
stoical
endurance
with
a
sort
of
religious
patience
added
gets
that
maybe
from
being
a
descendant
of
the
prophet
awful
sort
to
have
to
fight
that
kind
are
said
jeremy
they
wear
you
down
so
the
french
decided
some
time
ago
to
persuade
feisul
intimates
to
make
a
bad
break
which
he
could
repudiate
why
do
he
cut
loose
with
forty
or
fifty
thousand
men
and
boot
the
french
into
the
sea
demanded
jeremy
i
make
one
to
help
him
i
knew
a
frenchman
once
who
we
come
to
that
presently
said
grim
i
dare
say
you
did
hear
of
verdun
objection
sustained
hand
it
to
they
got
guts
grinned
jeremy
fire
away
old
top
well
they
ran
foul
of
an
awkward
predicament
which
is
that
there
are
some
darned
decent
fellows
among
the
officers
of
their
army
of
occupation
there
more
than
a
scattering
of
decent
gentlemen
who
do
like
dirt
i
wo
say
they
tell
feisul
secrets
or
disobey
orders
but
if
you
want
to
give
a
man
a
square
deal
there
are
ways
of
doing
it
without
sending
him
telegrams
mabel
put
the
tea
back
on
the
kerosene
stove
to
stew
with
an
extra
handful
of
black
leaves
in
it
grim
continued
another
thing
the
french
are
half
afraid
that
if
they
take
the
field
against
feisul
on
some
pretext
he
get
assistance
from
the
british
they
could
send
him
things
he
needs
more
than
money
and
get
per
cent
of
the
british
are
some
of
them
would
risk
their
jobs
to
help
him
in
a
pinch
the
french
have
got
to
stall
those
men
before
they
can
attack
feisul
safely
how
mean
stall
demanded
jeremy
not
all
the
british
are
fools
only
their
statesmen
and
generals
and
sixty
percent
of
the
junior
officers
and
rank
and
file
the
rest
do
have
to
be
fed
pap
from
a
bottle
they
good
men
takes
more
than
talk
to
stall
that
kind
off
a
man
they
like
you
got
the
idea
jeremy
you
have
to
show
them
well
why
not
stir
up
revolution
here
in
palestine
in
feisul
name
why
not
get
the
malcontents
to
murder
jews
wholesale
with
propaganda
blowing
full
blast
to
make
it
look
as
if
feisul
hand
is
directing
it
all
it
as
simple
as
falling
off
a
log
french
agents
who
look
like
honest
arabs
approach
the
most
hairbrained
zealots
who
happen
to
be
on
the
inside
with
feisul
and
suggest
to
them
that
the
french
and
british
are
allies
therefore
the
only
way
to
keep
the
british
from
helping
the
french
will
be
to
start
trouble
in
palestine
that
will
keep
the
british
busy
protecting
themselves
and
the
jews
the
secret
agents
point
out
that
although
feisul
is
against
anything
of
the
sort
he
must
be
committed
to
it
for
his
own
sake
and
they
make
great
capital
out
of
feisul
promise
that
he
will
protect
the
jews
if
recognized
as
king
of
independent
syria
kill
all
the
jews
beforehand
so
there
wo
be
any
for
him
to
protect
when
the
time
comes
that
the
argument
mabel
interrupted
have
you
warned
feisul
she
had
both
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
chin
between
her
hands
and
i
dare
say
she
had
listened
in
just
that
attitude
to
fifty
inside
stories
that
the
newspapers
would
scatter
gold
in
vain
to
get
i
sure
did
and
he
has
sent
one
of
his
staff
down
here
to
keep
an
eye
on
things
i
saw
him
this
afternoon
riding
in
a
cab
toward
the
jaffa
gate
i
said
as
much
to
that
fellow
in
the
hospital
and
he
was
scared
stiff
at
the
idea
of
my
recovering
the
supposed
feisul
letter
and
showing
it
to
an
officer
who
is
really
in
feisul
confidence
that
i
mean
the
man
fear
linked
everything
up
you
talk
like
sherlock
holmes
laughed
jeremy
i
bet
you
a
new
hat
nothing
comes
of
it
that
bet
on
grim
answered
it
to
be
a
female
hat
and
mabel
gets
it
order
an
expensive
one
from
paris
mabel
jeremy
shall
pay
we
lots
of
other
information
the
troops
here
have
been
warned
of
an
intended
massacre
of
jews
the
arrival
of
this
letter
probably
puts
a
date
to
it
but
it
puts
a
date
to
something
else
on
which
the
whole
future
of
the
near
east
hangs
and
that
means
the
future
of
half
the
world
and
maybe
the
whole
of
it
because
about
three
hundred
million
mohammedans
are
watching
feisul
and
will
govern
themselves
accordingly
india
persia
mesopotamia
egypt
all
northern
africa
there
almost
no
limit
to
what
depends
on
feisul
safety
and
the
french
ca
or
wo
understand
that
there
came
the
sound
of
heavy
ammunition
boots
outside
on
the
stone
step
followed
by
a
cough
that
i
believe
i
could
recognize
among
a
thousand
narayan
singh
coughs
either
of
two
ways
once
deep
bass
for
all
well
twice
almost
falsetto
for
a
hint
of
danger
this
time
it
was
the
single
deep
bass
cough
but
it
was
followed
after
half
a
minute
by
the
two
barks
and
grim
held
up
a
hand
for
silence
at
the
end
of
perhaps
a
minute
there
came
from
the
veranda
a
perfect
imitation
of
the
lascar
ungrammatical
whining
singsong
from
a
hum
dekta
hai
i
on
the
watch
grim
nodded
to
himself
i
suppose
for
none
had
spoken
to
him
do
you
mind
stepping
out
and
getting
that
letter
from
him
ramsden
keep
in
the
shadow
please
and
give
him
this
pistol
he
may
need
it
so
i
slipped
out
through
the
screen
door
and
spent
a
minute
looking
for
narayan
singh
i
an
old
hunter
but
it
was
until
narayan
singh
deliberately
moved
a
hand
to
call
attention
to
himself
that
i
discovered
him
within
ten
feet
of
me
the
risk
of
being
seen
from
the
street
in
case
some
spy
were
lurking
out
there
was
obvious
so
i
walked
all
the
way
round
the
house
and
came
and
stood
below
him
on
his
left
hand
where
the
house
cast
impenetrable
shadow
but
though
i
took
my
time
and
moved
stealthily
he
heard
me
and
passed
me
a
letter
through
the
veranda
rails
accepting
the
pistol
in
exchange
without
comment
i
could
see
him
distinctly
from
that
angle
his
uniform
on
one
side
was
torn
almost
into
rags
and
his
turban
was
all
awry
as
if
he
had
lost
it
in
a
scuffle
and
had
spared
time
to
rewind
it
properly
a
sure
sign
of
desperate
haste
for
a
male
tiger
in
the
is
no
more
careful
of
his
whiskers
than
a
sikh
is
of
the
thirty
yards
of
cloth
he
winds
around
his
head
as
he
did
speak
or
make
any
more
movement
than
was
necessary
to
pass
me
the
letter
and
take
the
pistol
i
returned
the
way
i
had
come
entered
by
the
back
door
tossed
the
letter
to
grim
and
crept
back
again
to
bear
a
hand
in
case
of
need
grim
said
nothing
but
jeremy
followed
me
and
two
minutes
later
the
australian
and
i
were
crouching
in
darkness
below
the
veranda
this
time
i
do
think
narayan
singh
was
aware
of
friends
at
hand
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
slightly
lighter
gap
in
a
dark
wall
that
was
the
garden
gate
but
looked
more
like
a
dim
hole
leading
into
a
cave
there
being
no
other
entrance
that
we
knew
of
jeremy
and
i
doubled
up
on
the
same
job
and
a
rat
could
have
come
through
without
one
of
the
three
of
us
detecting
him
if
we
had
had
our
senses
with
us
we
might
have
realized
that
narayan
singh
was
perfectly
capable
of
watching
that
single
narrow
space
and
have
used
our
own
eyes
to
better
advantage
however
we
all
three
alive
today
and
two
of
us
learned
a
lesson
it
was
long
perhaps
five
minutes
before
a
man
showed
himself
outside
the
gate
like
a
spectre
dodging
this
and
that
way
in
response
to
unearthly
impulse
once
or
twice
he
started
forward
as
if
on
the
point
of
sneaking
in
but
thought
better
of
it
and
retreated
once
his
attitude
suggested
that
he
might
be
taking
aim
with
a
pistol
but
if
that
was
so
he
chose
not
to
waste
a
shot
or
start
an
alarm
by
firing
at
a
mark
he
could
see
what
he
did
accomplish
was
to
keep
six
keen
eyes
fixed
on
him
and
that
gave
three
other
men
their
chance
to
gain
an
entrance
at
the
rear
of
the
wall
in
the
garden
and
creep
up
unawares
it
was
probably
sheer
accident
that
led
all
three
of
them
along
the
far
side
of
the
house
but
it
was
fortunate
for
jeremy
and
me
for
otherwise
cold
steel
between
our
would
likely
have
been
our
first
intimation
of
their
presence
we
never
suspected
their
existence
until
they
gained
the
veranda
by
the
end
opposite
to
where
we
waited
and
i
think
they
would
have
done
their
murder
if
the
man
outside
the
gate
had
lost
his
head
from
excitement
or
some
similar
emotion
and
tried
to
make
a
signal
to
them
all
three
had
brought
up
against
the
end
window
where
a
shade
torn
in
two
places
provided
a
good
view
into
the
room
in
which
grim
mabel
and
the
doctor
were
still
sitting
each
of
them
had
a
pistol
and
their
intention
did
admit
of
doubt
are
you
there
sahib
narayan
singh
whispered
but
jeremy
and
i
were
aware
of
them
almost
as
soon
as
he
and
rather
than
make
a
noise
by
vaulting
the
veranda
rail
we
took
the
longer
route
by
way
of
the
front
steps
jeremy
who
was
wearing
sandals
kicked
them
off
and
not
having
to
creep
so
carefully
moved
faster
of
course
the
obvious
question
is
why
did
narayan
singh
shoot
i
had
a
pistol
too
why
did
i
use
it
well
i
tell
you
none
but
the
irresponsible
criminal
shoots
a
man
except
in
obedience
to
orders
or
in
you
may
argue
that
those
three
might
have
shot
ticknor
and
his
wife
and
grim
through
the
window
while
we
aired
our
superior
virtue
the
answer
to
that
is
that
they
did
although
that
was
their
intention
narayan
singh
already
once
that
night
in
danger
of
his
life
and
a
godless
heathen
sikh
as
i
have
heard
a
missionary
call
him
pocketed
the
pistol
i
had
given
him
before
proceeding
to
engage
he
being
also
a
white
man
by
the
proper
way
of
estimating
such
things
jeremy
was
first
on
the
scene
of
action
with
narayan
singh
close
behind
him
and
i
was
quite
a
bit
behind
for
i
tripped
against
the
top
step
in
my
hurry
the
noise
i
made
gave
the
alarm
and
the
three
arabs
twisted
round
like
cornered
scorpions
i
guess
they
could
see
us
well
at
first
having
been
staring
through
the
torn
shade
into
the
lighted
room
their
pistols
were
cocked
but
jeremy
fist
landed
in
the
nearest
face
before
he
could
shoot
and
he
went
crashing
backwards
into
his
friend
behind
whose
head
disappeared
for
a
moment
through
the
and
the
only
blood
shed
on
that
occasion
came
from
the
first
man
nose
and
the
back
of
the
second
man
neck
where
the
smashed
glass
slit
a
gash
in
it
the
third
man
fired
wildly
at
me
and
missed
a
fraction
of
a
second
before
narayan
singh
landed
on
him
with
hands
and
feet
whereat
the
man
in
the
street
emptied
his
pistol
at
me
and
ran
away
i
was
in
two
minds
whether
to
give
chase
to
him
but
made
the
wrong
decision
being
heavy
on
my
feet
and
none
too
fond
of
running
so
the
big
fish
got
away
but
even
with
my
help
added
the
three
less
important
fish
still
gave
a
lot
of
trouble
for
they
fought
like
wild
cats
using
teeth
and
nails
and
the
doctor
and
his
wife
and
grim
were
all
out
lending
a
hand
before
we
had
them
finally
convinced
that
the
game
was
up
mabel
trussed
up
the
worst
man
with
a
clothes
line
while
i
sat
on
him
i
expected
to
see
a
crowd
around
the
house
by
that
time
but
jerusalem
works
otherwise
than
some
cities
the
sound
of
a
sends
everybody
hurrying
for
cover
lest
some
enemy
accuse
them
afterwards
of
having
had
a
hand
in
the
disturbance
and
the
nearest
police
post
was
a
mile
away
so
we
had
our
little
outrage
all
to
ourselves
although
strange
tales
went
the
rounds
of
the
holy
city
that
night
and
two
weeks
later
several
european
newspapers
printed
a
beautiful
account
of
a
midnight
massacre
of
jews
we
dragged
our
prisoners
into
the
and
stood
them
up
in
front
of
grim
after
the
doctor
and
mabel
had
attended
to
their
hurts
which
were
especially
serious
although
nobody
need
expect
to
get
in
the
way
of
jeremy
fist
and
feel
comfortable
for
several
hours
afterwards
the
cut
made
in
the
second
man
neck
by
broken
glass
needed
several
stitches
but
the
third
man
was
only
winded
from
having
been
sat
on
and
of
course
he
was
much
more
sorry
for
himself
than
either
of
the
other
two
a
fact
that
grim
noted
there
was
another
noticeable
circumstance
that
shed
light
on
human
nature
and
grim
knowledge
of
it
they
were
all
three
eager
to
tell
their
story
although
not
necessarily
the
same
story
whereas
narayan
singh
who
knew
that
every
word
he
might
say
would
be
believed
implicitly
was
in
no
hurry
to
tell
his
at
all
now
when
you
dealing
with
eastern
and
people
of
the
sort
who
lie
instinctively
and
it
may
be
that
this
applies
to
the
west
as
well
it
a
good
plan
to
establish
if
you
can
a
basis
of
truth
for
them
to
build
their
tale
on
because
the
truth
acts
like
acid
on
untruth
they
going
to
lie
in
any
case
but
lies
told
without
any
reference
to
truth
knit
better
than
when
invented
at
a
moment
notice
to
explain
away
another
straightforward
statement
there
a
plausible
theory
that
culprits
taken
in
the
act
are
best
examined
in
secret
one
by
one
in
ignorance
of
all
the
evidence
against
them
the
wise
method
is
to
let
them
hear
the
evidence
against
themselves
nine
times
out
of
ten
they
will
accept
that
as
unanswerable
and
strive
to
twist
its
meaning
or
smother
it
under
a
mass
of
lies
but
the
truth
they
have
accepted
as
i
have
said
works
just
like
acid
and
destroys
their
argument
almost
as
fast
as
they
build
it
up
in
the
few
cases
when
that
does
happen
they
break
down
altogether
and
confess
anyhow
grim
who
taught
me
what
i
have
just
written
refused
to
listen
to
their
bleating
until
narayan
singh
first
told
in
their
hearing
all
that
he
knew
about
the
night
events
they
were
forced
to
sit
down
on
the
floor
and
listen
to
him
like
three
loungers
being
told
a
story
and
i
do
doubt
that
the
effect
was
strengthened
by
the
standing
facing
them
for
the
contrast
was
as
between
jackals
and
a
lion
not
that
they
were
small
men
for
they
were
or
mere
assassins
picked
up
in
the
suk
they
looked
well
fed
and
wore
fine
linen
whereas
narayan
singh
was
in
rags
and
had
lost
weight
in
our
recent
desert
marching
so
that
his
stood
out
and
he
looked
superficially
much
more
like
a
man
at
bay
than
they
did
but
their
faces
were
lean
in
the
wrong
place
and
puffy
under
the
eyes
in
place
of
courage
they
flaunted
an
insolent
leer
and
the
smile
intended
to
convey
betrayed
to
a
close
observer
anxiety
bordering
on
panic
the
most
offensive
part
about
them
really
was
their
feet
which
are
indices
of
character
too
often
overlooked
they
had
come
to
their
task
in
slippers
which
they
had
kicked
off
before
reaching
the
veranda
and
instead
of
the
firm
tough
feet
that
a
real
man
stands
on
what
they
displayed
as
they
squatted
were
subtle
soft
things
not
exactly
flabby
but
even
more
suggestive
of
treachery
than
their
thin
beaks
and
shifty
eyes
to
sum
them
up
they
were
dandies
of
the
kind
who
join
the
young
turk
party
and
believe
the
new
era
can
be
distilled
of
talk
and
tricks
and
they
looked
like
mean
animals
compared
to
that
staunch
conservative
narayan
singh
who
nevertheless
is
not
without
his
own
degree
of
subtlety
chapter
iv
i
call
this
awful
sahib
in
accordance
with
instructions
i
proceeded
to
christian
street
to
the
place
you
spoke
of
where
i
found
yussuf
dakmar
drinking
coffee
and
smoking
in
company
with
these
men
and
others
they
did
not
see
me
in
the
beginning
because
i
entered
by
the
door
of
a
house
threescore
and
five
paces
farther
down
the
street
and
having
by
that
means
gained
the
roof
i
descended
to
a
gallery
built
of
stone
above
one
end
of
the
and
there
lay
concealed
among
bags
they
conversed
in
arabic
and
presently
when
other
men
had
entered
some
of
whose
names
i
overheard
and
wrote
down
on
this
slip
of
paper
yussuf
dakmar
locked
the
outer
door
turning
the
great
key
twice
and
setting
a
chain
in
place
as
well
then
he
stood
on
a
red
stool
having
four
short
legs
with
his
back
to
the
door
that
he
had
locked
and
spoke
in
the
manner
of
one
who
stirs
a
multitude
gesticulating
greatly
the
argument
he
made
was
thus
he
said
that
jerusalem
is
a
holy
city
and
palestine
a
holy
land
and
that
promises
are
all
the
more
sacred
if
given
in
connection
with
religious
matters
whereat
they
all
applauded
greatly
nevertheless
a
little
later
on
he
mocked
at
all
religion
and
they
applauded
that
too
he
said
that
the
allies
persuaded
thereto
by
the
british
had
made
a
promise
to
the
emir
feisul
on
the
strength
of
which
the
arabs
made
common
war
with
the
allies
against
the
turks
and
germans
losing
of
their
own
a
hundred
thousand
men
and
untold
money
so
sahib
next
he
asked
them
how
much
of
that
promise
made
by
the
allies
to
emir
feisul
as
the
leader
of
the
arabs
had
been
kept
or
was
likely
to
be
kept
and
they
answered
in
one
voice
of
it
whereat
he
nodded
as
a
teacher
nods
gravely
when
the
pupils
have
their
lesson
well
by
heart
and
said
presently
in
a
voice
like
that
of
a
guru
denouncing
sin
woman
promise
is
a
little
matter
who
believes
it
when
it
is
broken
all
men
laugh
a
promise
extorted
under
threat
or
torture
is
not
binding
since
he
who
made
the
promise
was
not
free
to
govern
his
own
conduct
that
is
law
a
promise
made
in
business
said
he
a
contract
contingent
on
circumstances
and
subject
to
litigation
but
a
promise
made
in
wartime
by
a
nation
is
a
pledge
set
down
in
letters
of
blood
whoever
breaks
it
is
guilty
of
blood
and
whoever
fails
to
smite
dead
the
breaker
of
that
oath
commits
treason
against
allah
they
applauded
that
speech
greatly
sahib
and
when
they
grew
silent
he
bade
them
look
about
and
judge
for
themselves
at
whose
door
the
breaking
of
that
sacred
promise
really
lay
me
said
he
trace
of
arab
government
in
all
palestine
who
owns
the
land
he
asked
them
said
they
to
whom
has
the
country
been
given
he
shouted
the
jews
they
answered
and
he
grew
silent
for
a
while
like
a
teacher
whose
class
has
only
given
half
the
answer
to
a
question
until
presently
one
man
growled
out
the
sword
with
the
jews
in
the
name
of
allah
and
the
others
echoed
that
which
satisfied
him
for
he
smiled
nevertheless
not
using
those
words
himself
and
presently
he
continued
in
this

are
men
of
enlightenment
we
are
satisfied
to
leave
past
and
future
to
speculations
of
idle
dreamers
for
us
the
present
so
we
attach
no
value
to
the
fact
that
feisul
is
descended
in
a
straight
line
from
the
founder
of
the
moslem
faith
for
that
is
a
superstition
as
foolish
in
its
way
as
christianity
or
any
other
creed
but
who
is
there
like
feisul
who
can
unite
all
arabs
under
one
banner
they
answered
sahib
that
feisul
is
the
only
living
man
who
can
accomplish
that
making
many
assertions
in
his
praise
yussuf
dakmar
nodding
approval
as
each
spoke
said
he
when
they
had
finished
is
also
fallible
in
certain
ways
he
is
a
fool
and
principally
in
this
that
he
insists
on
keeping
his
own
promises
to
men
who
have
broken
their
own
promises
to
him
and
like
pupils
in
a
class
who
recite
their
lesson
they
all
murmured
that
such
a
course
as
that
is
madness
said
he
are
clear
on
that
point
we
are
not
altruists
nor
religious
fanatics
nor
slaves
but
men
of
common
sense
who
have
a
business
in
view
we
are
not
feisul
servants
but
he
ours
we
make
use
of
him
not
he
of
us
if
he
persists
in
a
wrong
course
we
must
force
him
into
the
right
one
for
the
day
of
autocratic
government
is
past
and
the
hour
has
come
when
those
who
truly
represent
the
people
have
the
first
right
to
direct
all
policy
if
the
right
is
still
withheld
from
them
they
must
take
it
and
it
is
we
in
this
room
who
truly
represent
the
arab
cause
on
whom
lies
the
responsibility
of
forcing
feisul
hand
well
sahib
these
three
prisoners
who
sit
here
offered
at
once
to
go
to
damascus
and
kill
the
men
who
are
advising
feisul
wrongly
they
said
that
if
they
were
given
money
they
could
easily
hire
damascenes
to
do
the
dagger
work
there
being
as
the
sahib
doubtless
knows
a
common
saying
in
these
parts
about
damascus
folk
and
sharp
steel
whereat
yussuf
dakmar
suddenly
assumed
a
sneering
tone
of
voice
saying
that
he
preferred
men
for
his
part
with
spunk
enough
to
do
such
work
themselves
and
there
was
an
argument
they
protesting
and
he
mocking
them
until
at
last
this
man
whose
neck
the
glass
cut
demanded
of
him
whether
he
yussuf
dakmar
was
not
in
truth
an
empty
boaster
who
would
flinch
at
bloodshed
he
seemed
to
have
been
waiting
for
just
that
sahib
for
he
smirked
and
threw
a
chest
am
a
man
said
he
example
as
well
as
precept
i
have
done
what
i
saw
fit
to
do
i
make
no
boasts
said
he
a
man
who
talks
about
himself
sets
others
talking
and
there
are
deeds
creditable
to
the
doer
that
are
best
not
spoken
of
but
i
will
tell
you
other
things
and
you
may
draw
your
own
conclusions
feisul
refuses
to
attack
the
french
having
promised
those
that
he
will
not
and
because
feisul
has
promised
to
protect
the
jews
and
is
likely
to
try
to
keep
that
promise
to
the
english
certain
of
his
intimates
in
damascus
in
whose
confidence
i
am
have
determined
to
force
both
issues
taking
steps
in
his
name
that
will
commit
him
finally
feisul
army
of
fifty
thousand
men
is
as
ready
as
it
will
ever
be
there
is
no
money
in
the
damascus
treasury
and
therefore
every
moment
of
delay
is
now
a
moment
lost
the
time
has
come
for
action
our
three
prisoners
were
listening
to
the
recitation
spellbound
and
so
were
we
all
for
that
matter
the
mere
memory
feat
was
amazing
enough
few
men
could
listen
in
hiding
to
a
stranger
words
and
report
them
exactly
after
an
interval
of
more
than
an
hour
but
narayan
singh
did
better
than
that
for
he
reproduced
the
speaker
gesture
and
inflexion
so
that
we
had
a
mental
picture
of
the
scene
that
he
described
mabel
offered
him
stewed
tannic
acid
in
the
name
of
tea
and
ticknor
suggested
a
chair
but
he
waved
both
offers
aside
and
continued
as
if
the
picture
before
his
mind
and
the
words
he
was
remembering
might
escape
him
if
he
took
things
easy
sahib
they
were
very
much
excited
when
he
spoke
of
action
first
one
man
and
then
another
stood
up
and
boasted
of
having
made
all
things
ready
how
this
one
had
supervised
the
hiding
of
sharp
swords
how
another
had
kept
men
at
work
collecting
cartridges
on
battlefields
how
this
and
that
one
had
continued
spreading
talk
against
the
jews
so
that
they
swore
that
at
least
ten
thousand
moslems
in
jerusalem
are
fretting
to
begin
a
massacre
feisul
only
strike
the
first
blow
from
damascus
said
they
palestine
will
run
blood
instantly
and
we
sit
here
drinking
tea
exclaimed
mabel
while
up
at
headquarters
they
dancing
and
playing
bridge
i
call
this
awful
we
all
ought
to
be
grim
smiled
and
shook
his
head
for
silence
we
known
all
this
for
some
time
he
said
do
worry
there
be
no
massacre
the
troops
are
sleeping
by
their
arms
and
every
possible
contingency
has
been
provided
for
go
on
narayan
singh
well
sahib
when
they
had
done
babbling
and
boasting
this
yussuf
dakmar
got
back
on
his
stool
and
spoke
sternly
as
one
who
gives
final
judgment
and
intends
to
be
obeyed
is
we
who
must
make
the
first
move
said
he
we
shall
force
feisul
to
move
after
us
by
moving
in
his
name
whereat
this
man
here
whose
nose
was
broken
on
the
fist
of
jeremy
sahib
said
that
a
letter
bearing
feisul
seal
would
make
the
matter
easier
the
men
said
he
are
to
slit
jews
throats
will
ask
first
for
proof
of
our
authority
to
bid
them
begin
the
business
and
at
that
speech
yussuf
dakmar
laughed
with
great
delight
late
than
never
said
he
to
think
of
a
wise
precaution
now
than
not
at
all
but
oh
ye
are
an
crew
he
told
them
pity
the
conspiracy
that
had
no
better
planning
than
ye
would
make
for
it
without
my
fore
thought
i
thought
of
this
long
ago
i
sent
a
message
to
damascus
begging
that
a
date
be
set
and
just
such
a
letter
sent
to
us
feisul
i
knew
would
sign
no
such
letter
but
the
paper
he
uses
lies
on
an
open
desk
and
there
are
men
about
him
who
have
access
to
his
seal
and
because
my
appeal
was
it
met
with
approval
a
letter
such
as
i
asked
for
was
written
on
feisul
paper
sealed
with
his
seal
and
sent
does
it
bear
his
signature
a
man
asked
could
it
since
he
never
saw
the
letter
yussuf
dakmar
answered
few
will
pay
heed
to
it
said
the
other
if
we
were
all
such
fools
as
you
that
might
be
so
yussuf
dakmar
retorted
fortunately
the
rest
of
us
have
readier
wits
this
letter
is
signed
with
a
number
and
the
number
is
that
of
feisul
generation
in
descent
from
the
prophet
mohammed
let
men
be
told
that
this
is
his
secret
signature
and
when
they
see
his
seal
beside
it
will
they
not
believe
every
hour
in
jerusalem
and
in
all
the
world
men
believe
things
less
credible
than
that
but
at
that
sahib
another
man
asked
him
how
they
might
know
that
the
letter
really
came
from
damascus
well
might
be
said
that
one
forgery
contrived
by
yussuf
dakmar
himself
in
which
case
though
they
might
stir
many
moslems
into
action
by
showing
it
the
men
in
damascus
would
fail
to
follow
up
the
massacre
by
striking
at
the
french
and
if
they
do
not
strike
at
the
french
said
he
french
will
not
appeal
to
the
british
for
aid
and
so
the
british
troops
will
be
free
to
protect
the
jews
and
butcher
us
by
which
means
we
shall
be
worse
off
than
before
whereat
yussuf
dakmar
laughed
again
ye
will
go
to
the
sikh
hospital
said
he
will
find
there
the
man
who
brought
the
letter
he
lies
in
a
cot
in
the
upper
storey
with
a
between
his
it
was
a
mistaken
accident
unfortunate
for
him
the
letter
was
intended
for
me
but
i
did
not
know
that
what
does
the
life
of
one
fool
matter
he
gave
out
that
jews
stabbed
him
and
it
may
be
he
believes
that
yet
i
have
the
letter
in
my
pocket
here
and
he
touched
with
one
hand
the
portion
of
his
coat
beneath
which
was
the
pocket
that
contained
the
letter
i
was
watching
sahib
from
where
i
lay
hidden
he
was
about
i
think
to
show
them
the
letter
when
another
thought
occurred
to
him
he
wrinkled
his
brow
as
if
seeking
words
in
which
to
make
his
meaning
clear
and
they
seemed
willing
enough
to
wait
for
him
but
not
so
i
for
i
now
knew
where
the
letter
was
so
i
sprang
into
their
midst
falling
less
dangerously
than
i
might
have
done
by
reason
of
a
man
shoulders
that
served
for
a
cushion
it
may
be
that
his
bones
broke
under
my
weight
i
can
give
no
accurate
report
as
to
that
for
i
was
in
great
haste
but
as
he
gave
way
under
me
i
pitched
forward
and
kicking
yussuf
dakmar
in
the
belly
with
my
boot
i
fell
on
him
they
falling
on
me
in
turn
and
we
all
writhing
together
in
one
mass
on
the
floor
so
i
secured
the
letter
good
man
grim
nodded
wish
i
been
there
mourned
jeremy
and
having
what
i
came
for
i
broke
free
and
taking
the
red
stool
i
hurled
it
at
the
lamp
so
that
we
were
in
total
darkness
which
made
it
a
simple
matter
to
unlock
the
door
and
proceed
about
my
business
nevertheless
i
heard
them
strike
matches
behind
me
and
it
seemed
unwise
to
take
to
my
heels
at
once
it
being
easy
to
pursue
a
man
who
runs
as
the
sahib
doubtless
remembers
between
that
coffee
shop
and
the
next
house
is
a
stone
buttress
jutting
out
into
the
street
forming
on
its
side
farthest
from
the
a
dark
corner
for
whose
filth
and
stink
the
street
cleaners
ought
to
be
punished
therein
i
lurked
while
those
who
pursued
ran
past
me
up
the
street
i
counting
them
and
among
them
i
did
not
count
yussuf
dakmar
and
three
more
it
happened
that
a
man
was
running
up
the
street
and
the
pursuers
supposed
him
to
be
me
so
i
was
left
with
only
four
to
deal
with
and
it
entered
my
head
that
no
doubt
jimgrim
sahib
would
be
pleased
to
interview
yussuf
dakmar
and
after
a
few
moments
yussuf
dakmar
came
forth
and
i
heard
him
speak
to
these
three
fellows
fools
said
he
like
street
dogs
at
the
sound
of
rubbish
tossed
out
of
a
window
but
i
think
that
indian
soldier
is
less
foolish
than
they
if
i
were
he
said
yussuf
dakmar
think
i
would
run
far
with
all
these
shadows
to
right
and
left
and
all
the
hours
from
now
until
dawn
in
which
to
act
the
fox
i
suspect
he
is
not
far
away
at
this
minute
nevertheless
said
he
indians
are
dangerous
fellows
it
is
highly
important
that
we
get
that
letter
from
him
but
it
is
almost
equally
important
that
we
stop
his
mouth
which
would
be
impossible
if
he
should
escape
alive
if
we
wait
here
said
he
shall
see
him
emerge
from
a
shadow
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
so
they
waited
sahib
and
after
a
few
minutes
when
my
breath
had
returned
to
me
i
let
him
have
credit
as
a
wise
one
by
emerging
as
he
had
said
and
those
four
stalked
me
through
the
streets
not
daring
to
come
close
until
i
should
lead
them
to
a
lonely
place
and
i
led
them
with
discretion
to
this
house
where
happened
what
the
sahib
knows
that
is
all
i
know
about
this
matter
except
that
being
absent
from
duty
on
there
may
be
difficulty
in
the
matter
of
my
tunic
which
is
badly
torn
having
finished
his
story
narayan
singh
stood
at
attention
like
one
of
those
wooden
images
they
used
to
keep
on
the
sidewalk
outside
tobacco
stores
grim
smiled
at
the
prisoners
and
asked
whether
they
had
any
remarks
to
make
a
totally
lawless
proceeding
for
he
did
not
caution
them
and
had
no
jurisdiction
as
a
magistrate
they
were
three
men
caught
attempting
murder
and
burglary
and
entitled
accordingly
to
protection
that
the
law
does
always
accord
to
honest
men
but
as
i
have
said
a
true
tale
in
the
ears
of
criminals
acts
like
a
chemical
reagent
it
sets
them
to
work
lying
and
the
lie
burns
off
disclosing
naked
truth
again
but
mother
of
me
they
were
daring
liars
the
fellow
who
had
come
out
of
the
scrap
more
or
less
unscathed
piped
up
for
the
three
the
other
two
nodding
and
prompting
him
in
whispers
what
that
indian
says
in
the
main
is
true
he
did
jump
down
from
the
gallery
and
surprise
a
meeting
summoned
by
yussuf
dakmar
and
it
is
true
that
yussuf
dakmar
purpose
is
to
bring
about
a
massacre
of
jews
which
is
to
be
simultaneous
with
an
attack
by
feisul
forces
on
the
french
in
syria
but
we
three
men
are
not
in
favour
of
it
we
have
had
no
part
in
the
preparations
although
we
know
all
details
we
are
honest
men
who
have
the
public
interest
at
heart
and
accordingly
we
have
spied
on
yussuf
dakmar
purposing
to
expose
all
his
plans
to
the
authorities
jeremy
began
humming
to
himself
mabel
tittered
and
little
doctor
ticknor
swore
under
his
breath
but
grim
looked
as
if
he
believed
them
looked
pleasantly
surprised
and
nodded
gravely
but
that
hardly
explains
your
following
this
indian
through
the
streets
and
attacking
him
on
the
veranda
he
suggested
as
if
sure
they
could
explain
that
too
as
sure
enough
they
did
we
did
not
attack
him
he
attacked
us
it
was
obvious
to
us
from
the
first
that
he
must
be
an
agent
of
the
government
so
when
yussuf
dakmar
told
us
to
follow
and
murder
him
we
decided
it
was
time
to
expose
yussuf
dakmar
and
that
this
was
our
opportunity
we
knew
surely
that
this
indian
would
take
that
letter
straight
to
some
official
of
the
government
it
was
only
necessary
to
pretend
to
hunt
him
and
in
that
manner
inveigle
yussuf
dakmar
into
the
toils
but
when
we
reached
this
house
yussuf
dakmar
was
afraid
and
refused
to
approach
nearer
than
the
street
he
insisted
on
keeping
watch
outside
the
garden
gate
while
we
should
draw
near
and
shoot
everyone
who
might
be
in
the
house
and
recover
the
letter
he
is
a
coward
and
we
could
not
persuade
him
so
we
decided
to
pretend
to
do
his
bidding
and
to
whisper
through
the
window
to
the
people
within
to
pass
out
to
the
street
by
some
back
way
and
capture
him
after
which
we
would
give
all
our
evidence
to
the
authorities
it
was
while
we
were
looking
through
the
window
seeking
to
call
the
attention
of
those
within
for
that
purpose
and
no
other
that
we
were
attacked
and
submitted
to
much
unnecessary
violence
that
is
the
whole
truth
as
allah
is
our
witness
we
are
honest
men
who
seek
to
uphold
the
law
and
we
claim
the
protection
of
the
government
we
are
ready
to
tell
all
we
know
including
the
names
of
those
connected
with
this
plot
chapter
v
nobody
will
know
no
bouquets
there
followed
a
tedious
hour
or
two
during
which
grim
the
three
honest
men
and
took
down
lists
of
names
from
their
dictation
getting
doctor
ticknor
meanwhile
to
go
for
the
police
because
yussuf
dakmar
might
still
be
lurking
in
the
neighbourhood
for
a
chance
to
murder
narayan
singh
it
was
only
after
the
police
had
carried
off
the
prisoners
to
jail
where
they
repudiated
their
entire
confession
next
morning
that
grim
showed
us
the
letter
which
like
a
spark
had
fired
a
powder
magazine
although
a
smaller
one
than
its
writer
intended
it
is
in
feisul
handwriting
he
said
holding
the
feathery
arab
script
up
to
the
lamplight
and
it
no
more
like
his
phraseology
than
a
camel
resembles
a
locomotive
listen
to
this
to
the
committee
in
jerusalem
by
favour
of
yussuf
dakmar
bey
its
district
president
greeting
in
the
name
of
god
ye
know
that
on
former
occasions
the
foes
of
our
land
and
race
were
overwhelmed
when
relying
on
the
aid
of
the
most
high
and
raising
the
green
banner
of
the
prophet
on
whom
be
peace
we
launched
our
squadrons
in
a
cause
held
sacred
by
us
all
ye
know
that
in
that
fashion
and
not
otherwise
the
accursed
conquerors
were
driven
forth
and
our
sacred
banner
was
set
on
high
over
the
damascus
roofs
where
by
allah
blessing
may
it
wave
for
ever
ye
know
how
those
who
claimed
to
be
our
friends
have
since
proven
themselves
foes
so
that
the
independent
state
for
which
we
fought
is
held
today
in
ignominious
subjection
by
aliens
who
deny
the
true
faith
and
hold
their
promises
as
nothing
ye
know
how
damascus
is
beset
by
the
french
and
palestine
is
held
by
the
british
who
notwithstanding
the
oath
they
swore
to
us
are
daily
betraying
us
arabs
to
the
jews
know
now
then
that
the
hour
has
struck
when
again
in
the
name
of
allah
we
must
finish
what
we
formerly
began
and
with
our
true
swords
force
these
infidels
to
yield
our
country
to
us
nor
on
this
occasion
shall
we
sheathe
our
swords
until
from
end
to
end
our
land
is
free
and
united
under
one
government
of
our
own
choosing
know
that
this
time
there
shall
be
no
nor
any
compromise
it
is
written
ye
shall
show
no
quarter
to
the
infidel
let
no
jew
live
to
boast
that
he
has
footing
in
the
land
of
our
ancestors
leave
ye
no
root
of
them
in
the
earth
nor
seedling
that
can
spring
into
a
tree
smite
and
smite
swiftly
in
the
name
of
him
who
never
sleeps
who
keeps
all
promises
whose
almighty
hand
is
ready
to
preserve
the
faithful
whereunto
ye
are
bidden
to
take
courage
whereunto
our
army
of
syria
stands
ready
whereunto
the
day
has
been
appointed
know
ye
that
the
tenth
day
from
the
sending
of
this
letter
and
at
dawn
is
the
appointed
time
therefore
let
all
make
common
cause
for
the
favour
of
the
most
high
which
awaits
the
faithful
in
the
name
of
god
and
mohammed
the
prophet
of
god
on
whom
be
blessings
there
followed
the
moslem
date
and
the
numerical
signature
over
indubitable
seal
grim
figured
a
moment
and
worked
out
the
corresponding
date
according
to
our
western
calendar
leaves
six
days
he
said
pleasantly
it
means
the
french
intend
to
attack
damascus
seven
days
from
now
let
jeremy
exploded
feisul
give
all
they
got
are
algerians
the
french
have
poison
gas
grim
answered
dourly
feisul
men
have
no
masks
get
some
that
was
jeremy
again
grim
did
answer
but
went
on
talking
they
going
to
get
damascus
all
they
waited
for
was
poison
gas
and
now
there
no
stopping
they
forged
this
letter
after
the
gas
arrived
now
if
they
catch
feisul
in
damascus
they
put
him
on
trial
for
his
life
and
they
probably
hope
to
get
this
letter
back
somehow
to
use
as
evidence
against
him
go
slow
jim
mabel
objected
where
your
proof
that
the
french
are
jockeying
this
is
that
feisul
seal
yes
and
it
his
paper
but
not
his
handwriting
he
might
have
dictated
it
might
he
never
in
those
words
feisul
do
talk
or
write
that
way
the
letter
a
manifest
forgery
as
i
prove
by
confronting
feisul
with
it
but
there
a
little
oversight
that
should
convince
you
it
a
forgery
have
you
a
magnifying
glass
doc
ticknor
produced
one
in
a
minute
and
grim
held
the
letter
under
the
lamp
on
the
rather
wide
margin
carefully
rubbed
out
but
not
so
carefully
that
the
indentation
did
not
show
was
the
french
word
magnifique
that
had
been
written
with
a
rather
heavy
hand
and
one
of
those
hard
pencils
supplied
to
colonial
governments
by
exporters
from
stocks
that
ca
be
sold
at
home
that
proves
nothing
mabel
insisted
all
educated
arabs
talk
french
somebody
on
feisul
staff
was
asked
for
an
opinion
on
the
letter
before
it
went
my
husband
arab
orderly
told
me
only
yesterday
that
a
sling
i
made
for
a
man
in
the
hospital
was
magnifique
the
objection
was
well
enough
taken
because
it
was
the
sort
the
forger
of
the
letter
would
be
likely
to
raise
if
brought
to
book
but
argument
was
not
exhausted
there
are
other
points
mabel
for
one
thing
it
blue
metallic
ink
feisul
private
letters
are
all
written
with
indelible
black
stuff
made
from
pellets
that
i
gave
him
they
imported
from
the
states
but
if
feisul
wanted
to
prove
an
alibi
he
naturally
would
use
his
special
private
ink
objected
mabel
then
why
his
seal
and
his
special
private
notepaper
however
another
point
feisul
writes
the
purest
kind
of
arabic
and
this
that
sort
of
arabic
it
was
written
by
a
foreigner
perhaps
a
frenchman
possibly
an
armenian
most
likely
a
turk
certainly
one
of
the
outer
ring
of
politicians
who
have
access
to
feisul
and
seek
to
control
him
but
are
not
really
in
his
confidence
damascus
is
simply
a
network
of
spies
of
that
kind
men
who
attached
themselves
to
the
arab
cause
when
it
looked
like
winning
and
are
now
busy
transferring
their
allegiance
i
think
i
could
name
the
man
who
wrote
this
i
think
i
know
the
man
who
wrote
that
magnifique
if
i
right
yussuf
dakmar
will
notify
the
french
tonight
through
their
agents
in
jerusalem
the
man
who
wrote
that
magnifique
will
know
before
morning
that
the
letter
missing
and
it
does
matter
how
careful
i
may
be
it
be
known
as
soon
as
i
start
for
damascus
they
dope
out
that
our
obvious
course
would
be
to
confront
feisul
with
this
letter
the
only
way
to
travel
is
by
train
the
roads
are
rotten
in
fact
no
auto
could
get
through
they
tip
off
the
bedouins
who
murder
everybody
so
they
watch
the
trains
and
especially
haifa
where
everyone
going
north
has
to
spend
the
night
and
they
stop
at
nothing
to
get
the
letter
back
for
two
reasons
as
long
as
it
in
our
hands
it
can
be
used
to
establish
proof
of
the
plot
against
feisul
once
it
back
in
theirs
they
can
keep
it
in
their
secret
dossier
to
use
against
feisul
if
they
ever
catch
him
and
bring
him
to
trial
you
remember
the
dreyfus
case
i
shall
start
for
damascus
by
the
early
train
probably
take
an
auto
as
far
as
ludd
if
i
want
to
live
until
i
reach
damascus
i
shall
have
to
prove
conclusively
that
i
have
that
letter
with
me
anyone
known
to
be
in
british
service
is
going
to
be
suspected
and
if
not
murdered
robbed
ramsden
has
been
seen
about
too
much
with
me
jeremy
might
juggle
by
but
he
already
notorious
and
these
people
are
shrewd
better
hold
jeremy
in
reserve
and
the
same
with
narayan
singh
a
woman
best
how
about
you
mabel
what
mean
jim
do
you
know
a
woman
in
haifa
of
course
i
do
well
enough
to
expect
a
bed
for
the
night
at
a
moment
notice
certainly
mabel
eyes
were
growing
very
bright
indeed
it
was
her
husband
who
looked
alarmed
well
now
here
the
point
grim
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
lit
a
cigarette
not
looking
at
anybody
stating
his
case
impersonally
as
it
were
which
is
much
the
shrewdest
way
of
being
personal
feisul
up
against
it
and
he
the
best
man
in
all
this
land
bar
none
they
dealt
to
him
from
a
cold
deck
and
he
bound
to
lose
this
hand
whichever
way
he
plays
it
to
put
it
differently
he
in
check
but
not
checkmated
he
be
checkmated
though
if
the
french
ever
lay
hands
on
him
and
then
to
the
arab
chance
for
twenty
years
i
propose
to
save
him
for
another
effort
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
to
convince
him
the
best
way
to
convince
him
is
to
show
him
that
letter
which
ca
be
done
if
feisul
enemies
discover
who
carries
it
if
ramsden
jeremy
narayan
singh
and
i
start
for
damascus
pretending
that
one
or
other
of
us
has
the
letter
concealed
on
his
person
and
if
a
woman
really
carries
it
we
manage
is
mabel
ticknor
going
to
be
the
woman
that
the
point
too
dangerous
jim
too
dangerous
ticknor
put
in
nervously
pardon
me
old
man
the
danger
is
for
us
four
who
pretend
we
got
the
thing
there
are
lots
of
other
women
and
i
only
got
one
wife
objected
ticknor
we
pressed
for
time
grim
answered
you
see
ticknor
old
man
you
a
cornstalk
and
therefore
an
outsider
just
a
medico
who
saws
bones
for
a
living
satisfied
to
keep
your
body
out
of
the
poorhouse
your
soul
out
of
hell
and
your
name
out
of
the
newspapers
your
wife
is
presumably
more
so
there
are
several
officials
wives
who
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
be
useful
but
a
sudden
trip
toward
damascus
just
now
would
cause
any
one
of
them
to
be
suspected
whereas
mabel
be
i
do
know
why
not
ticknor
retorted
was
she
in
here
when
those
three
murderers
came
to
finish
the
lot
of
us
if
yussuf
dakmar
makes
any
report
at
all
he
surely
say
he
traced
the
letter
to
this
house
yussuf
dakmar
came
no
nearer
than
the
street
grim
answered
he
has
no
notion
who
is
in
here
his
three
friends
are
in
jail
under
lock
and
key
where
he
ca
get
at
them
how
long
have
you
had
this
house
since
yesterday
is
it
kid
yourself
that
yussuf
dakmar
knows
who
lives
here
i
can
get
leave
of
absence
suppose
i
go
in
mabel
place
suggested
ticknor
visibly
worried
the
mere
fact
that
she
goes
while
you
stay
here
will
be
presumptive
evidence
that
she
is
on
a
dangerous
mission
grim
answered
no
it
has
got
to
be
a
woman
if
mabel
wo
go
i
find
someone
else
you
could
tell
by
mabel
eyes
and
attitude
that
she
was
what
the
salesmen
call
sold
already
but
you
did
need
a
magnifying
glass
to
detect
that
ticknor
was
men
of
his
wandering
habit
know
too
well
what
a
brave
wife
means
to
encourage
her
to
take
long
chances
for
although
there
are
lots
of
women
who
would
like
to
wander
and
accept
the
world
pot
luck
there
are
precious
few
capable
of
doing
it
without
doubling
a
fellow
trouble
when
they
know
how
to
halve
the
trouble
and
double
the
fun
they
priceless
grim
played
his
usual
game
which
is
to
spank
down
his
ace
of
trumps
face
upward
on
the
table
most
of
us
forget
what
are
trumps
in
a
crisis
i
guess
it
up
to
you
doc
he
said
turning
toward
ticknor
nothing
in
it
for
you
feisul
is
on
the
make
i
do
believe
he
cares
ten
cents
who
is
to
be
the
nominal
ruler
of
the
arabs
provided
they
get
their
promised
independence
he
rather
retire
and
live
privately
but
he
only
considers
himself
in
so
far
as
he
can
serve
the
arab
cause
now
you
risked
mabel
life
a
score
of
times
in
order
to
help
sick
men
in
mining
camps
and
malaria
victims
and
lord
knows
what
else
here
a
chance
to
do
the
biggest
thing
of
all
of
course
if
you
put
it
that
way
said
ticknor
hesitating
just
your
style
too
nobody
will
know
no
bouquets
you
wo
have
to
stammer
a
speech
at
any
dinner
given
in
your
honor
want
to
do
it
mabel
asked
ticknor
looking
at
her
keenly
across
the
table
of
course
i
do
all
right
girl
only
hurry
back
he
looked
hard
at
grim
again
then
into
my
eyes
and
then
jeremy
she
in
your
hands
i
do
want
to
see
any
of
you
three
chaps
alive
again
unless
she
comes
back
safe
is
that
clear
clear
and
clean
exploded
jeremy
it
a
bet
doc
half
a
mo
you
chaps
that
my
mine
at
abu
kem
is
it
i
agreed
to
give
the
thing
to
feisul
and
make
what
terms
i
can
with
him
jim
and
rammy
divvy
up
with
me
on
my
end
if
any
that
right
i
say
let
the
doc
and
mabel
have
a
each
of
anything
our
end
amounts
to
well
it
took
about
as
long
to
settle
that
business
as
you
expect
the
doctor
and
mabel
protested
but
it
easier
to
give
away
a
fortune
that
is
still
in
prospect
than
a
small
sum
that
is
really
tangible
i
mean
between
folk
who
stand
on
their
own
feet
it
does
seem
to
deprive
the
giver
of
much
or
to
strain
the
pride
of
the
recipient
unduly
i
been
given
shares
in
unproven
el
doradoes
times
out
of
number
and
could
paper
the
wall
of
say
a
bathroom
with
the
stock
certificates
may
do
it
some
day
if
i
ever
settle
down
but
the
only
gift
of
that
sort
that
i
ever
knew
to
pay
dividends
except
to
the
printer
of
the
scrip
is
jeremy
gold
mine
and
you
look
in
vain
for
any
mention
of
that
in
the
stock
exchange
lists
the
time
to
get
in
on
that
good
thing
was
that
night
by
mabel
ticknor
teapot
in
jerusalem
it
was
nearly
midnight
before
we
had
everything
settled
and
there
was
still
a
lot
to
do
before
we
could
catch
the
morning
train
one
thing
that
grim
did
was
to
take
gum
and
paper
and
contrive
an
envelope
that
looked
in
the
dark
sufficiently
like
the
alleged
feisul
letter
and
he
carried
that
in
his
hand
as
he
took
to
the
street
with
narayan
singh
following
among
the
shadows
within
hail
jeremy
and
i
kept
narayan
singh
in
sight
for
it
was
possible
that
yussuf
dakmar
had
gathered
a
gang
to
waylay
whoever
might
emerge
from
the
house
but
he
seemed
to
have
had
enough
of
bungling
accomplices
that
night
grim
had
gone
fifty
paces
keeping
well
in
the
middle
of
the
road
when
a
solitary
shadow
began
stalking
him
and
doing
it
so
cautiously
that
though
he
had
to
cross
the
circles
of
street
lamplight
now
and
then
neither
jeremy
nor
i
could
have
identified
him
afterward
narayan
singh
had
orders
not
to
do
anything
but
guard
grim
against
assault
for
grim
judged
it
wise
to
leave
yussuf
dakmar
at
large
than
to
precipitate
a
climax
by
arresting
him
he
had
the
names
of
most
of
the
local
conspirators
and
if
the
leader
were
seized
too
soon
the
equally
dangerous
rank
and
file
might
scatter
and
escape
down
inside
the
jaffa
gate
in
a
dark
alley
beside
the
grand
hotel
there
are
usually
two
or
three
cabs
standing
at
any
hour
of
the
night
ready
to
care
for
belated
christian
gentlemen
who
have
looked
on
the
wine
when
it
was
any
colour
that
it
chanced
to
be
there
were
three
there
and
grim
took
the
first
one
flourishing
his
envelope
carelessly
under
the
corner
lamp
yussuf
dakmar
took
the
next
in
line
and
ordered
the
driver
to
follow
grim
so
we
naturally
took
the
last
one
all
three
of
us
crowding
on
to
the
rear
seat
in
order
to
watch
the
cabs
in
front
but
as
soon
as
we
had
driven
back
outside
the
city
gate
yussuf
dakmar
looked
behind
him
and
growing
suspicious
of
us
ordered
his
driver
to
let
us
pass
it
would
have
been
too
obvious
if
we
had
stopped
too
so
we
hid
our
faces
as
we
passed
and
then
put
jeremy
on
the
front
seat
he
looking
like
an
arab
and
being
most
unrecognizable
yussuf
dakmar
followed
us
at
long
range
and
as
the
lean
horses
toiled
slowly
up
the
mount
of
olives
to
headquarters
the
interval
between
the
cabs
grew
greater
by
the
time
we
reached
the
and
answered
the
sikh
challenge
there
was
no
sign
of
grim
in
front
and
we
could
only
hear
in
the
distance
behind
us
the
occasional
click
of
a
loose
shoe
to
tell
that
yussuf
dakmar
was
still
following
chapter
vi
better
the
evil
that
we
know
yussuf
dakmar
had
his
nerve
with
him
that
night
or
possibly
desperation
robbed
him
of
discretion
he
may
have
been
a
more
than
usually
daring
man
with
his
wits
about
him
but
you
have
to
hunt
down
the
valley
of
death
before
you
could
bring
the
psychoanalytic
guns
to
bear
on
him
for
what
they
worth
i
can
only
tell
you
what
he
did
not
why
he
did
it
the
great
hospice
that
the
german
nation
built
on
the
crown
of
the
mount
of
olives
to
glorify
their
kaiser
stood
like
a
shadow
among
shadows
in
its
compound
surrounded
by
a
fairly
high
wall
there
was
a
pretty
strong
guard
under
an
indian
officer
in
the
at
the
arched
main
gate
where
the
sentry
challenged
us
a
sentry
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
under
the
portico
at
the
main
entrance
and
there
was
another
armed
man
on
duty
patrolling
the
grounds
but
there
were
one
or
two
other
entrances
locked
though
quite
easy
to
negotiate
which
the
sentry
could
only
observe
while
he
marched
toward
them
for
five
minutes
at
a
time
while
his
back
was
turned
at
least
two
gates
leading
to
official
residences
offered
opportunity
to
an
active
man
one
lone
light
at
a
window
on
the
top
floor
suggested
that
the
officer
of
the
night
might
be
awake
but
what
with
the
screeching
of
owls
and
a
wind
that
sighed
among
the
shrubs
headquarters
looked
and
sounded
more
like
a
deserted
ancient
castle
than
the
cranium
and
of
administration
we
heard
yussuf
dakmar
stop
his
cab
two
hundred
yards
away
the
cabman
turned
his
horses
and
drove
back
toward
jerusalem
without
calling
on
allah
to
witness
that
his
fare
should
have
been
twice
what
he
received
he
did
even
lash
the
horses
savagely
so
we
supposed
that
he
been
paid
and
went
on
to
deduce
from
that
that
yussuf
dakmar
had
driven
away
again
after
satisfying
himself
that
the
feisul
letter
had
reached
headquarters
it
was
lazy
bad
reasoning
the
sort
of
superficial
smart
stuff
that
has
cost
the
lives
of
thousands
of
good
men
times
out
of
number
four
o
the
morning
intelligence
that
like
the
courage
of
that
hour
needs
priming
by
the
foreman
or
the
or
the
bosun
as
the
case
may
be
the
sentry
turned
out
the
guard
who
let
us
through
the
gate
after
a
word
with
narayan
singh
and
the
man
who
leaned
on
his
bayonet
under
the
portico
at
the
end
of
the
drive
admitted
us
without
any
argument
at
all
i
suppose
he
thought
that
having
come
that
far
we
must
be
people
in
authority
ever
since
then
i
have
believed
all
the
stories
told
me
about
spies
who
walked
where
they
chose
unchallenged
during
wartime
for
we
three
a
sikh
enlisted
man
an
australian
disguised
as
an
arab
and
an
american
in
civilian
clothes
entered
unannounced
and
unwatched
the
building
where
every
secret
of
the
near
east
was
pigeonholed
we
walked
about
the
corridors
and
up
and
downstairs
for
ten
minutes
looking
in
vain
for
grim
here
and
there
a
servant
snored
on
a
mat
in
a
corner
and
once
a
big
dog
came
and
sniffed
at
us
without
making
any
further
comment
jeremy
kicked
one
man
awake
who
mistaking
him
for
an
arab
cursed
him
in
three
languages
in
the
name
of
three
separate
gods
and
promptly
went
to
sleep
again
the
sensation
was
like
being
turned
loose
in
the
of
a
national
treasury
with
nobody
watching
if
you
should
choose
to
help
yourself
there
are
acres
of
floor
in
that
building
we
walked
twice
the
whole
circuit
of
the
upper
and
lower
corridors
knocking
on
dozens
of
doors
but
getting
no
answer
and
finally
brought
up
in
the
entrance
hall
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
grim
might
have
gone
into
the
building
by
some
private
entrance
perhaps
round
on
the
eastern
side
so
we
set
out
to
look
for
one
we
had
just
reached
the
northwest
angle
of
the
building
when
narayan
singh
who
was
walking
a
pace
in
front
stopped
suddenly
and
held
up
both
hands
for
silence
whoever
he
could
see
among
the
shadows
must
have
heard
us
but
it
was
no
rare
thing
for
officers
to
come
roistering
down
those
front
steps
and
along
the
drive
hours
after
midnight
and
our
sudden
silence
was
more
likely
to
give
alarm
than
the
noise
had
been
i
began
talking
again
in
a
normal
voice
saying
anything
at
all
peering
about
into
the
shadows
meanwhile
but
it
was
several
seconds
before
i
made
out
what
the
sikh
keener
eyes
had
detected
instantly
and
jeremy
saw
it
before
i
did
there
was
a
magnolia
shrub
about
ten
paces
away
from
us
casting
a
shadow
so
deep
that
the
ground
it
covered
looked
like
a
bottomless
abyss
but
nevertheless
something
bright
moved
in
it
perhaps
the
sheen
of
that
lone
light
in
an
upper
window
reflected
on
a
or
a
button
something
that
moved
in
time
to
a
man
breathing
if
there
was
a
certainty
in
the
world
it
was
that
somebody
who
had
no
right
to
be
there
was
lurking
in
that
shadow
and
he
was
presumably
up
to
mischief
on
the
other
hand
i
had
absolutely
no
right
in
that
place
either
jeremy
and
narayan
singh
being
both
in
the
british
army
were
liable
to
be
disciplined
and
i
might
be
requested
to
leave
the
country
if
we
should
happen
to
blunder
and
tree
the
wrong
revenge
being
more
than
usually
sweet
to
the
official
disturbed
in
the
pursuit
of
unauthorized
diplomacy
it
might
even
be
some
clandestine
love
affair
so
i
took
each
of
my
companions
by
the
arm
gripping
particularly
tightly
and
started
forward
whispering
an
explanation
after
we
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
building
let
one
of
us
go
and
warn
the
guard
i
suggested
if
we
should
draw
that
cover
and
start
a
shindy
we
more
likely
to
get
shot
by
the
guard
than
thanked
so
narayan
singh
started
off
for
the
he
being
the
one
most
capable
of
explaining
matters
to
the
sikh
officer
and
jeremy
and
i
crept
back
through
the
shadows
to
within
earshot
of
the
dark
magnolia
tree
choosing
a
point
from
which
we
could
see
if
anybody
bolted
you
know
how
some
uncatalogued
sense
informs
you
in
the
dark
of
the
movement
of
the
man
beside
you
i
looked
suddenly
sideways
toward
jeremy
knowing
although
i
could
see
him
that
his
eyes
were
seeking
mine
it
is
only
the
animals
who
omit
in
the
darkness
those
instinctive
daylight
movements
men
do
have
sufficient
control
of
themselves
we
had
both
heard
grim
voice
at
the
same
instant
speaking
arabic
but
unmistakable
there
were
three
men
there
grim
was
talking
to
the
other
two
keep
your
hands
on
each
other
shoulders
do
move
i
going
to
search
all
your
pockets
again
now
charkian
ah
that
feels
like
quite
a
pretty
little
weapon
mother
o
pearl
on
the
butt
have
you
a
permit
never
mind
not
having
the
weapon
you
wo
need
a
permit
will
you
and
papers
mashallah
what
a
lot
of
documents
they
must
be
highly
important
ones
since
you
hide
them
under
your
shirt
i
expect
you
planned
to
sell
them
eh
too
bad
too
bad
you
keep
your
hands
on
charkian
shoulders
yussuf
dakmar
or
have
to
use
violence
i
not
sure
charkian
that
it
would
be
kinder
to
society
to
send
you
to
jail
after
all
you
need
a
bath
so
badly
it
seems
a
pity
that
a
chief
clerk
to
the
administration
should
have
a
chance
to
wash
himself
does
it
well
i
have
to
read
these
papers
afterward
after
we
usurped
the
prerogative
of
destiny
and
mapped
out
a
little
of
the
future
now
are
you
both
listening
do
you
know
who
i
am
there
was
no
answer
you
mr
charkian
i
think
you
are
major
grim
ah
you
wish
to
flatter
me
do
you
never
mind
let
us
pretend
i
major
grim
disguised
as
an
arab
only
i
afraid
we
must
continue
the
conversation
in
arabic
i
might
disillusion
you
if
i
tried
to
talk
english
we
say
then
that
i
major
grim
disguised
let
see
now
what
would
he
do
in
the
circumstances
here
yussuf
dakmar
wanted
for
murder
in
the
city
and
known
to
be
plotting
a
massacre
seen
climbing
a
wall
when
the
sentry
back
was
turned
and
caught
in
conference
with
charkian
confidential
clerk
to
the
administration
i
sorry
i
did
hear
all
that
was
said
at
your
conference
for
that
might
have
made
it
easier
to
guess
what
major
grim
would
do
do
play
with
us
like
a
cat
playing
with
a
mouse
snarled
somebody
tell
us
what
you
want
if
you
were
major
grim
you
have
handed
us
over
to
those
officers
who
passed
just
now
you
just
as
much
irregular
as
we
are
hurry
up
and
make
your
bargain
or
the
guard
may
come
and
arrest
us
all
yes
hurry
up
complained
the
other
man
i
do
want
to
be
caught
here
and
as
for
those
papers
you
have
taken
if
we
are
caught
i
shall
say
you
stole
them
from
the
office
you
and
yussuf
dakmar
and
that
i
followed
you
to
recover
them
and
you
both
attacked
me
very
well
said
grim
voice
pleasantly
i
let
you
go
i
think
you
dangerous
you
better
be
quick
because
i
think
i
hear
the
guard
coming
give
me
back
the
papers
then
aha
will
you
wait
and
discuss
them
with
the
guard
or
go
at
once
the
armenian
clerk
did
answer
but
got
up
and
slunk
away
why
did
you
let
that
fool
go
demanded
yussuf
dakmar
now
he
will
awaken
some
officer
and
start
hue
and
cry
with
a
story
that
we
robbed
him
listen
there
comes
the
guard
we
had
better
both
run
not
so
fast
grim
answered
and
then
he
raised
his
voice
perceptibly
as
if
he
wished
to
be
overheard
i
think
those
men
who
passed
just
now
were
not
officers
at
all
perhaps
they
were
strangers
it
may
be
that
one
of
them
is
confused
and
is
leading
the
guard
in
the
wrong
direction
do
make
so
much
noise
then
retorted
yussuf
dakmar
jeremy
who
thinks
habitually
about
ten
times
as
fast
as
i
do
slipped
away
at
once
into
the
shadows
to
find
narayan
singh
and
decoy
the
guard
elsewhere
i
did
envy
him
the
job
for
sikhs
use
cold
steel
first
and
argue
afterward
when
on
the
qui
vive
in
the
dark
however
he
accomplished
his
purpose
narayan
singh
saved
his
life
and
the
guard
arrested
him
on
general
principles
you
could
hear
both
jeremy
and
narayan
singh
using
grim
name
freely
yussuf
dakmar
was
deaf
he
gave
tongue
there
did
you
hear
that
they
are
speaking
of
major
grim
you
are
a
fool
if
you
wait
here
any
longer
that
fellow
grim
is
a
devil
i
tell
you
if
he
finds
us
we
are
both
lost
we
have
to
be
found
first
grim
answered
and
you
could
almost
hear
him
smile
quick
then
what
do
you
want
snapped
yussuf
dakmar
grim
answer
was
the
real
surprise
of
the
evening
it
bewildered
me
as
much
as
it
astonished
yussuf
dakmar
i
want
that
letter
that
came
from
the
emir
feisul
i
have
got
it
i
swear
i
have
i
know
that
already
for
i
searched
you
where
is
it
ask
allah
it
was
stolen
by
a
sikh
who
delivered
it
to
someone
in
a
house
near
the
military
hospital
who
in
turn
gave
it
to
an
arab
who
brought
it
here
i
hoped
that
fellow
charkian
might
steal
it
back
again
but
you
have
spoiled
everything
charkian
will
turn
against
me
now
to
save
himself
what
do
you
want
with
the
letter
i
must
have
it
grim
answered
the
french
agent
what
sidi
said
you
know
him
surely
he
would
pay
me
a
thousand
pounds
for
it
may
allah
change
his
face
he
only
offered
me
five
hundred
you
have
seen
him
already
then
grim
asked
i
do
believe
you
when
did
you
see
him
on
the
way
up
here
he
stopped
my
cab
to
speak
to
me
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
i
began
to
see
the
drift
of
grim
purpose
he
had
established
the
fact
that
the
french
secret
agent
was
already
on
the
track
of
the
letter
and
that
in
turn
explained
why
he
had
not
seized
yussuf
dakmar
and
put
him
in
jail
it
was
better
to
use
the
man
as
the
sequel
proved
and
yussuf
dakmar
walked
straight
into
grim
trap
what
is
your
name
he
demanded
call
me
omar
said
grim
a
turk
are
you
well
omar
let
us
help
each
other
to
get
that
letter
and
divide
the
reward
sidi
said
told
me
that
the
british
are
sure
to
confront
feisul
with
it
and
to
do
it
secretly
if
they
can
they
will
try
to
send
it
to
damascus
let
us
two
find
out
who
takes
it
and
waylay
him
why
should
i
divide
with
you
demanded
grim
who
is
much
too
good
an
actor
to
pretend
to
agree
without
bargaining
because
otherwise
you
will
not
succeed
i
was
afraid
of
you
when
you
first
surprised
me
with
charkian
but
now
that
i
know
you
for
a
spy
in
the
pay
of
the
french
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
even
though
you
have
my
revolver
and
dagger
you
dare
not
kill
me
for
i
would
shout
for
help
and
the
guard
would
come
you
are
in
danger
as
much
as
i
am
so
you
may
either
agree
to
work
with
me
sharing
the
reward
or
you
may
work
alone
and
have
nothing
for
your
pains
for
i
shall
bring
accomplices
to
help
me
take
the
letter
from
you
after
you
have
stolen
it
well
i
suppose
that
anyone
with
criminal
intentions
could
submit
gracefully
to
that
much
blackmail
besides
grim
was
rather
pressed
for
time
and
could
afford
to
prolong
the
argument
i
see
you
are
a
determined
man
he
answered
your
demand
is
unreasonable
but
i
must
agree
to
it
then
give
me
back
my
pistol
no
i
need
it
i
lent
mine
this
evening
to
another
man
who
has
not
yet
returned
it
that
was
a
piece
of
wood
with
which
i
held
you
up
just
now
you
must
get
yourself
another
they
are
hard
to
come
by
in
jerusalem
give
me
mine
back
no
i
shall
keep
it
to
protect
myself
against
you
why
you
have
no
need
to
fear
me
if
we
work
together
because
i
intend
to
tell
you
what
i
know
and
i
may
find
it
convenient
to
shoot
you
if
you
betray
the
information
oh
well
tell
away
i
have
been
cleverer
than
you
grim
announced
blandly
i
knew
who
had
given
the
order
to
the
sikh
to
steal
that
letter
from
you
and
i
was
concealed
in
his
house
when
the
letter
was
brought
to
him
i
heard
the
conference
that
followed
so
i
know
what
is
going
to
be
done
about
it
oh
that
was
very
smart
well
tell
me
three
men
are
going
to
take
the
letter
to
damascus
but
i
do
know
which
of
them
will
have
it
on
his
person
one
is
an
arab
one
is
an
american
the
third
is
that
same
sikh
who
took
the
letter
from
you
they
will
take
the
train
from
ludd
and
i
have
engaged
myself
as
servant
to
the
american
now
that
was
extremely
clever
of
you
said
yussuf
dakmar
yes
grim
agreed
but
perhaps
it
will
be
as
well
to
have
an
accomplice
after
all
and
you
will
do
as
well
as
any
if
i
steal
the
letter
they
may
accuse
me
but
if
i
can
pass
it
to
you
then
i
can
submit
to
a
search
and
oblige
them
to
apologize
true
true
that
will
be
excellent
so
you
had
better
take
the
morning
train
for
damascus
grim
continued
but
understand
if
you
bring
others
with
you
i
shall
suspect
you
of
intending
to
play
a
trick
on
me
in
that
event
i
shall
shoot
you
with
your
own
pistol
and
take
my
chance
of
escaping
afterward
in
fact
you
are
a
dead
man
yussuf
dakmar
the
minute
i
suspect
you
of
playing
me
false
the
same
to
you
likewise
yussuf
dakmar
answered
fervently
then
we
understand
each
other
said
grim
the
best
thing
you
can
do
between
now
and
is
to
see
the
french
agent
again
what
good
will
that
do
he
is
irritable
nervous
he
will
only
ask
a
thousand
questions
then
your
visit
will
do
all
the
more
good
you
can
calm
him
we
want
a
horde
of
fools
interfering
with
us
on
the
journey
we
want
to
work
quietly
and
to
share
the
reward
between
us
therefore
you
should
tell
him
that
you
are
confident
of
getting
the
letter
if
he
will
only
leave
the
business
to
you
alone
give
him
every
assurance
and
explain
to
him
that
interference
may
mean
failure
now
i
have
done
much
the
greater
part
so
far
let
this
be
your
share
to
balance
the
account
between
us
you
go
to
sidi
said
the
french
agent
and
make
sure
that
he
does
hinder
us
by
trying
to
help
very
well
i
will
do
that
and
i
shall
meet
you
at
the
station
in
the
morning
no
my
party
will
go
as
far
as
ludd
by
motor
you
will
see
us
join
the
train
there
go
now
while
the
guard
is
out
of
the
way
i
could
not
see
but
i
heard
yussuf
dakmar
get
up
and
go
he
had
hardly
time
to
get
out
of
earshot
when
grim
voice
broke
the
silence
again
you
there
ramsden
instead
of
answering
i
approached
did
you
hear
what
was
said
he
asked
yes
why
did
you
arrest
both
the
blackguards
and
have
done
with
it
better
the
evil
that
we
know
he
answered
with
the
familiar
smile
in
his
voice
the
important
thing
is
to
sidetrack
the
french
agent
who
could
put
fifty
ruffians
on
our
trail
instead
of
one
why
not
send
a
guard
to
the
french
agent
then
ca
do
that
france
and
great
britain
are
allies
besides
they
might
retaliate
by
spiflicating
our
agent
in
damascus
wise
folk
who
live
in
do
throw
stones
what
i
think
has
been
accomplished
is
to
reduce
our
probable
risk
down
to
yussuf
dakmar
a
mean
squib
at
best
and
i
think
we
drawn
suspicion
clear
away
from
mabel
ticknor
all
that
remains
is
for
me
to
go
to
that
room
where
you
see
the
light
burning
and
discuss
matters
with
the
chief
if
he
awake
he
lonely
said
i
and
i
told
grim
of
our
experience
inside
the
building
yes
he
said
governments
are
all
like
that
they
talk
glibly
of
the
ship
of
state
but
a
ship
run
in
the
same
way
would
pile
up
or
sink
the
first
night
out
you
better
go
home
and
get
an
hour
sleep
i
call
you
at
seven
we
take
turns
sleeping
on
the
train
i
answered
come
first
and
rescue
jeremy
i
think
the
guard
pinched
him
say
did
you
intend
one
of
us
to
go
and
decoy
the
guard
away
that
time
you
raised
your
voice
sure
recognized
your
voices
yours
especially
when
you
passed
and
heard
you
breathe
as
you
crept
back
you
nearly
spoilt
the
game
by
turning
out
the
guard
but
you
saved
it
again
handsomely
it
a
marvel
those
sikhs
did
shoot
jeremy
in
the
dark
i
answered
you
bet
it
is
said
grim
i
guess
he
too
useful
to
be
allowed
to
die
just
now
he
hung
his
head
thinking
as
we
walked
side
by
side
that
was
a
close
shave
too
close
well
as
you
say
let
go
and
rescue
him
chapter
vii
you
talk
like
a
madman
grim
changed
the
plan
a
little
at
the
last
minute
mabel
ticknor
left
jerusalem
by
train
as
agreed
but
narayan
singh
was
sent
that
way
too
to
keep
an
eye
on
her
he
being
a
sikh
could
sit
in
the
corridor
without
exciting
comment
and
being
dressed
for
the
part
of
a
more
or
less
prosperous
trader
he
could
travel
first
class
without
having
to
answer
questions
or
allay
suspicion
grim
jeremy
and
i
drove
to
ludd
in
a
hired
auto
grim
and
jeremy
both
in
arab
costume
and
i
trying
to
look
like
a
tourist
jeremy
was
supposed
to
be
a
travelled
arab
intent
on
guiding
me
about
damascus
for
the
usual
consideration
the
platform
was
crowded
and
we
secured
a
compartment
in
the
train
without
calling
much
attention
to
ourselves
there
were
british
officers
of
all
ranks
egyptians
jews
greeks
refugee
armenians
maltese
kurds
a
turk
or
two
circassians
men
from
as
far
off
as
bokhara
turkomans
indians
of
all
sorts
a
sprinkling
of
bedouins
looking
not
quite
so
at
home
as
in
their
native
desert
and
local
arabs
by
the
score
about
half
of
them
were
in
a
panic
encouraged
to
it
by
their
shrill
fighting
in
a
swarm
for
tickets
at
one
small
window
where
an
insolent
levantine
demonstrated
his
capacity
for
by
making
as
many
people
as
possible
miss
the
train
i
caught
sight
of
mabel
ticknor
in
the
front
compartment
of
our
car
and
grim
pointed
out
yussuf
dakmar
leaning
through
a
window
of
the
car
behind
his
face
was
fat
unwholesome
with
small
cold
eyes
an
immoral
nose
and
a
small
mouth
with
pouting
lips
the
tarboosh
he
wore
tilted
at
an
angle
heightened
the
general
effect
of
arrogant
he
was
an
illustration
of
the
ancient
mystery
how
is
it
that
a
man
with
such
a
face
and
such
insolence
written
all
over
him
can
become
a
leader
of
other
men
and
persuade
them
to
hatch
the
eggs
of
treachery
that
he
lays
like
a
cuckoo
in
their
nests
he
smirked
at
grim
suggestively
as
we
went
by
and
grim
of
course
smirked
back
with
a
sidewise
inclination
of
the
head
in
my
direction
whereat
yussuf
dakmar
withdrew
himself
apparently
satisfied
now
he
waste
a
lot
of
time
investigating
you
said
grim
in
an
undertone
we
better
keep
awake
in
turns
or
he
knife
you
the
toe
of
my
boot
to
him
i
retorted
one
clean
kick
might
solve
this
international
affair
steady
grim
answered
we
need
him
until
after
leaving
haifa
the
french
agent
wired
and
they
have
a
gang
at
haifa
ready
for
us
but
yussuf
dakmar
will
warn
them
off
if
we
keep
him
hoping
so
we
settled
down
into
our
compartment
after
a
glance
to
make
sure
that
mabel
was
all
right
and
for
about
two
minutes
i
imagined
we
were
in
for
a
lazy
journey
narayan
singh
was
on
a
in
the
corridor
snoozing
with
one
eye
open
like
a
faithful
it
did
seem
possible
for
a
creature
like
yussuf
dakmar
to
make
trouble
for
us
and
i
proposed
that
we
should
match
coins
for
the
first
turn
to
go
to
sleep
we
had
just
pulled
our
coins
out
and
the
engineer
was
backing
the
train
in
order
to
get
her
started
when
yussuf
dakmar
arrived
at
our
door
carrying
his
belongings
and
claimed
a
seat
on
the
strength
of
a
lie
about
there
being
no
room
elsewhere
there
something
about
a
compartment
on
a
train
that
makes
whoever
gets
in
first
regard
the
rest
of
the
world
as
intruders
nobody
would
have
been
welcome
but
we
would
have
preferred
a
pig
to
yussuf
dakmar
jeremy
democrat
of
democrats
who
had
slept
without
complaining
between
the
legs
of
a
dead
horse
on
a
battlefield
with
a
lousy
turkish
prisoner
hugging
him
close
to
share
the
blanket
was
up
in
arms
at
once
imshi
he
ordered
bluntly
but
yussuf
dakmar
was
delighted
the
reception
convinced
him
if
anything
were
needed
to
do
that
that
one
of
us
really
was
guarding
the
secret
letter
and
he
was
one
of
those
hogs
anyhow
who
glory
in
snouting
in
where
they
are
plainly
not
wanted
he
took
the
corner
seat
opposite
jeremy
tucked
his
legs
up
under
him
produced
a
cigarette
and
smiled
offensively
i
concede
this
though
i
think
the
smile
was
meant
to
be
ingratiating
he
pulled
out
a
package
wrapped
in
newspaper
and
began
to
eat
before
the
train
had
run
a
mile
and
you
know
more
men
get
killed
because
of
how
they
eat
than
by
the
stuff
they
devour
if
you
do
believe
that
try
living
in
camp
for
a
week
or
two
with
a
man
who
chews
meat
with
his
mouth
open
you
feel
the
promptings
of
a
murderer
i
know
a
scientist
who
swears
that
the
real
secret
of
the
cain
and
abel
story
is
that
abel
sucked
his
gums
at
mealtime
you
ought
to
be
buried
up
to
the
neck
and
fed
with
a
shovel
jeremy
informed
him
in
blunt
english
after
listening
to
the
solo
for
a
while
aha
that
is
the
way
they
used
to
treat
criminals
in
persia
he
answered
pleasantly
with
his
mouth
full
of
goat
milk
cheese
only
they
put
plaster
of
paris
in
the
hole
and
when
it
rained
the
wretched
man
was
squeezed
until
the
blood
came
out
of
his
mouth
and
eyes
and
he
died
in
agony
but
how
comes
it
that
you
speak
to
me
in
english
if
we
are
both
arabs
why
not
talk
the
mother
tongue
my
rump
is
my
rump
and
the
land
is
its
rulers
jeremy
answered
in
arabic
quoting
the
rudest
proverb
he
could
think
of
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
ah
and
who
is
its
ruler
who
is
to
be
its
ruler
yussuf
dakmar
made
a
surreptitious
face
at
grim
and
his
little
cold
eyes
shone
like
a
hungry
pariah
dog
it
began
to
be
interesting
to
watch
his
opening
gambit
i
have
heard
tales
he
went
on
of
a
new
ruler
for
this
country
what
do
you
think
of
feisul
chance
as
he
said
that
he
eyed
me
sideways
swiftly
and
keenly
grim
sat
back
in
his
own
corner
and
folded
up
his
legs
watching
the
game
contentedly
jeremy
intercepting
yussuf
dakmar
glance
put
his
own
construction
on
it
he
is
a
long
lean
man
but
like
the
fat
boy
in
pickwick
papers
he
likes
to
make
your
flesh
creep
and
humor
to
have
full
zest
for
him
has
to
be
mischievous
so
he
commenced
by
pulling
out
his
weapons
one
by
one
the
first
was
a
razor
which
he
sharpened
tested
with
his
thumb
suggestively
and
then
placed
in
his
sock
studying
yussuf
dakmar
throat
for
a
minute
or
so
after
that
as
if
expecting
to
have
to
use
the
razor
on
it
presently
as
the
effect
of
that
wore
off
he
pulled
out
a
pistol
it
was
one
of
the
kind
that
wo
go
off
unless
you
pull
the
hammer
back
but
yussuf
dakmar
did
know
that
and
if
he
had
flesh
and
blood
capable
of
creeping
it
a
safe
assertion
that
they
crept
jeremy
acted
as
if
he
did
understand
the
weapon
and
for
fifteen
minutes
did
more
stunts
with
it
than
a
puppy
can
do
with
a
ball
of
twine
one
of
them
that
interested
yussuf
dakmar
awfully
was
to
point
the
pistol
straight
ahead
and
try
to
get
the
hammer
down
by
slapping
it
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
most
of
our
baggage
was
on
the
floor
but
one
fairly
heavy
valise
was
in
the
rack
over
yussuf
dakmar
head
jeremy
got
up
to
examine
it
when
the
pistol
had
ceased
to
amuse
him
and
taking
advantage
of
a
jerk
as
the
train
slowed
down
contrived
to
drop
it
into
the
syrian
lap
who
rather
naturally
swore
whereat
jeremy
took
offence
and
accused
him
of
being
a
descendant
of
hanna
son
of
manna
who
lived
for
a
thousand
and
one
years
and
never
enjoyed
himself
it
was
our
turn
to
eat
sandwiches
after
that
while
yussuf
dakmar
recovered
from
his
disgruntlement
but
just
before
the
meal
was
finished
jeremy
revived
the
game
by
asking
suddenly
in
an
awestruck
whisper
where
it
was
he
slapped
himself
all
over
in
a
hurry
feeling
for
hidden
pockets
and
then
came
over
and
pretended
to
search
me
there
was
anything
to
do
but
fall
in
with
his
mood
so
i
resisted
searched
my
own
pockets
reluctantly
and
said
that
we
might
as
well
take
the
next
train
back
since
we
had
lost
the
important
document
before
we
started
we
had
put
into
a
wallet
the
fake
envelope
that
grim
had
carried
in
his
hand
the
previous
night
and
had
entrusted
the
wallet
to
jeremy
in
order
to
have
an
alibi
ready
for
mabel
in
case
of
need
grim
took
up
the
cudgels
now
and
reminded
me
respectfully
as
a
servant
should
when
speaking
to
his
master
that
i
had
taken
all
proper
precautions
and
could
not
be
blamed
in
any
event
but
i
think
it
will
be
found
he
said
hopefully
inshallah
it
is
not
lost
but
in
the
wallet
in
the
pocket
of
that
friend
of
yours
so
jeremy
went
back
to
his
corner
searched
for
the
wallet
found
it
after
pretty
nearly
standing
on
his
head
to
shake
his
clothes
examined
it
excitedly
and
produced
the
fake
envelope
flourishing
it
so
violently
that
nobody
even
with
eyes
like
a
hawk
could
have
identified
it
with
certainty
then
he
dropped
it
in
among
the
baggage
on
the
floor
and
went
down
on
his
knees
to
pick
it
up
again
there
is
no
more
finished
expert
at
sleight
of
hand
than
he
so
it
vanished
and
he
swore
he
could
find
it
in
a
agony
of
nervousness
he
called
on
yussuf
dakmar
to
get
down
and
help
him
search
and
the
syrian
had
enough
left
to
pretend
to
hesitate
his
cold
eyes
were
nearly
popping
from
his
head
as
he
knelt
and
groped
the
chief
subject
of
interest
to
me
just
then
was
how
he
proposed
to
retain
the
letter
in
the
unlikely
event
of
his
finding
it
first
it
was
a
ridiculous
search
because
there
was
really
anywhere
to
look
after
three
bags
had
been
lifted
and
their
bottoms
scrutinized
the
whole
floor
of
the
compartment
lay
naked
to
the
eye
except
where
my
feet
rested
jeremy
insisted
on
my
raising
them
to
the
accompaniment
of
what
he
considered
suitable
comment
on
their
size
turning
his
behind
end
meanwhile
toward
yussuf
dakmar
grim
chuckled
and
caught
my
eye
yussuf
dakmar
had
walked
straight
into
temptation
and
was
trying
to
search
jeremy
pockets
from
the
rear
no
easy
matter
for
he
had
to
discover
them
first
in
the
loose
folds
of
the
arab
costume
suddenly
jeremy
mood
changed
he
became
suspicious
stood
up
resumed
his
seat
and
glared
at
yussuf
dakmar
who
retired
into
his
corner
and
tried
to
seem
unconscious
of
the
game
i
believe
you
are
a
thief
one
of
those
devils
from
said
jeremy
suddenly
after
about
three
minutes
silence
i
believe
you
have
stolen
my
letter
like
the
saint
ass
you
are
a
clever
devil
are
you
nevertheless
you
are
like
a
man
without
fingernails
whose
scratching
does
him
no
good
your
labour
was
in
vain
give
me
back
the
letter
or
by
allah
i
will
turn
you
upside
down
yussuf
dakmar
denied
the
accusation
with
all
the
fervour
that
a
blackguard
generally
does
use
when
for
once
he
is
consciously
innocent
by
the
beard
of
the
prophet
and
on
my
honor
i
swear
to
you
that
i
have
touched
your
letter
i
do
know
where
it
is
show
me
the
prophet
beard
commanded
jeremy
show
me
your
honor
you
talk
like
a
madman
how
can
i
show
either
then
how
can
you
swear
by
them
father
of
easy
words
and
evil
deeds
give
me
the
letter
back
yussuf
dakmar
appealed
to
me
as
presumably
responsible
for
jeremy
you
saw
effendi
did
you
i
tried
to
help
him
but
he
who
plays
with
the
cat
must
suffer
her
claws
so
now
he
accuses
me
of
stealing
i
call
you
to
witness
that
i
took
nothing
you
must
excuse
him
i
answered
that
is
a
highly
important
letter
if
it
is
found
the
consequences
may
be
disastrous
by
allah
it
shall
be
found
exploded
jeremy
glaring
harder
than
ever
at
yussuf
dakmar
look
at
his
face
look
at
his
evil
eyes
he
came
in
here
on
purpose
to
spy
on
us
and
steal
that
letter
it
is
time
to
use
my
razor
on
him
i
swear
not
by
the
prophet
beard
or
honor
but
by
the
razor
in
my
sock
that
he
has
the
letter
and
that
i
will
have
it
back
well
that
was
a
challenge
there
was
no
sure
of
being
able
to
prove
innocence
yussuf
dakmar
decided
that
a
bold
course
was
the
best
he
proceeded
to
empty
his
own
pocket
laying
the
contents
on
the
seat
before
jeremy
eyes
and
jeremy
watched
like
a
puzzled
puppy
with
his
brow
wrinkled
the
process
took
time
because
he
was
wearing
one
of
those
imitation
western
suits
of
prehistoric
cut
but
with
every
imaginable
pocket
that
a
tailor
could
invent
their
contents
included
a
dagger
and
a
with
a
long
blade
sharpened
on
both
edges
but
no
pistol
now
are
you
satisfied
he
demanded
after
turning
the
two
secret
pockets
in
the
lining
of
his
vest
less
than
ever
jeremy
retorted
until
i
see
you
naked
i
will
not
believe
you
yussuf
dakmar
turned
to
me
again
he
was
a
patient
spy
if
ever
there
was
one
do
you
think
i
should
be
put
to
that
indignity
he
asked
shall
i
undress
myself
by
allah
unless
you
do
it
i
will
cut
your
clothes
off
with
my
razor
jeremy
announced
we
drew
up
at
a
station
then
and
had
to
wait
until
the
train
went
on
again
by
that
time
yussuf
dakmar
had
made
up
his
mind
he
slipped
off
his
jacket
and
vest
and
began
to
unfasten
his
as
the
train
gained
speed
everything
went
smoothly
until
he
stood
up
to
remove
his
pants
he
had
the
top
of
them
in
both
hands
when
jeremy
seized
him
suddenly
by
the
elbows
and
spun
him
face
about
and
there
the
letter
lay
face
downward
on
the
seat
he
had
just
left
bent
and
a
little
crinkled
in
proof
that
he
had
been
sitting
on
it
for
some
minutes
past
now
it
does
make
any
difference
whether
a
man
meant
to
take
off
his
trousers
or
not
in
a
crisis
if
they
are
unfastened
he
will
hold
them
up
it
like
catching
a
monkey
you
put
corn
into
a
basket
the
monkey
inserts
his
arm
fills
his
hand
with
corn
and
tries
to
pull
it
out
but
ca
unless
he
lets
go
of
the
corn
which
he
do
so
you
catch
him
yussuf
dakmar
held
up
his
pants
with
one
hand
and
tried
to
free
himself
from
jeremy
with
the
other
if
he
had
let
go
his
pants
he
might
have
seized
the
envelope
and
discovered
what
a
fake
it
was
but
he
would
do
that
it
was
i
who
pounced
on
it
and
stowed
it
away
carefully
in
my
inner
pocket
yussuf
dakmar
emotions
were
poignant
and
mixed
but
he
was
no
quitter
he
thought
he
knew
definitely
where
the
letter
was
now
and
the
wolf
glance
with
which
he
favoured
me
changed
swiftly
to
a
smile
of
ingratiating
politeness
i
am
glad
you
have
recovered
what
you
lost
he
said
smiling
as
he
fastened
up
his
pants
and
resumed
his
coat
this
friend
of
yours
or
is
he
your
servant
made
me
nervous
with
his
threats
or
i
should
certainly
have
found
it
for
you
sooner
and
now
grim
resumed
a
hand
the
last
thing
he
wished
was
that
yussuf
dakmar
should
consider
his
quest
too
difficult
for
then
he
would
probably
summon
assistance
at
haifa
encouragement
was
the
proper
cue
now
that
jeremy
had
tantalized
him
with
a
glimpse
of
the
bait
we
had
nothing
to
fear
from
him
unless
he
should
lose
heart
the
value
of
a
sum
lies
in
the
answer
he
said
quoting
one
of
those
copybook
proverbs
with
which
all
syrians
love
to
clinch
an
argument
the
letter
is
in
its
owner
pocket
the
accuser
should
now
apologize
and
we
can
spend
the
rest
of
the
journey
pleasantly
jeremy
proceeded
to
apologize
so
you
not
such
a
thief
as
you
looks
then
he
provided
entertainment
he
drew
out
the
razor
and
did
stunts
with
it
juggling
it
with
open
blade
from
hand
to
hand
pretending
to
drop
it
and
always
catching
it
again
within
a
fraction
of
an
inch
of
yussuf
dakmar
person
by
and
by
he
juggled
with
coins
cigars
razor
and
anything
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
mashallah
exclaimed
the
syrian
at
last
his
face
all
sweaty
with
excitement
as
he
shrank
back
to
avoid
the
spinning
razor
where
did
you
learn
such
accomplishments
learn
them
answered
jeremy
still
juggling
i
am
a
dervaish
i
was
born
not
taught
i
can
ride
through
the
air
on
and
whatever
i
wish
for
is
mine
the
next
minute
look
i
have
one
piastre
i
wish
for
twenty
what
do
i
do
i
spin
it
in
the
air
catch
it
hear
them
there
you
are
twenty
count
if
you
like
a
dervaish
a
holy
person
you
where
do
you
come
from
i
was
born
in
the
belly
of
the
south
wind
answered
jeremy
where
i
come
from
every
has
a
pearl
in
it
and
gold
is
so
common
that
the
cattle
wear
it
in
their
teeth
i
can
talk
three
languages
at
once
and
swear
in
six
use
sulphur
for
tobacco
eat
sardines
without
opening
the
can
and
flavour
my
food
for
choice
with
i
been
everywhere
seen
everything
heard
all
the
lies
and
i
found
that
big
effendi
in
jerusalem
i
saw
him
first
he
calls
himself
ramsden
which
is
derived
from
the
name
of
a
creature
bearing
wool
which
in
turn
is
a
synonym
for
money
he
on
his
way
to
supply
feisul
with
money
and
i
going
to
show
him
the
streets
of
damascus
anything
else
you
want
to
know
supply
feisul
with
money
that
is
interesting
american
money
perhaps
an
american
banker
by
any
chance
nothing
to
do
with
chance
he
a
father
of
certainties
did
he
give
me
that
letter
to
keep
and
did
i
find
a
safe
place
for
it
between
you
and
the
cushions
yes
i
put
it
there
i
an
honest
man
but
i
have
my
reasonable
doubts
about
this
other
fellow
ramsden
effendi
found
him
somewhere
and
engaged
him
as
a
servant
without
asking
me
perhaps
he
honest
only
allah
knows
men
hearts
but
he
got
an
honest
face
like
yours
and
when
comes
i
shall
hide
my
money
so
you
know
damascus
answered
yussuf
dakmar
i
hope
you
will
come
and
see
me
in
damascus
i
will
give
you
my
address
if
ramsden
effendi
has
only
engaged
you
temporarily
perhaps
i
can
show
you
a
way
to
make
money
with
those
accomplishments
of
yours
make
money
answered
jeremy
prattling
away
like
a
madman
i
am
weary
of
the
stuff
i
hunting
the
world
over
in
search
of
a
friend
nobody
loves
me
i
want
to
find
someone
who
believe
the
lies
i
tell
him
without
expecting
me
to
believe
the
truth
he
tries
to
foist
on
me
i
want
to
find
a
man
as
tricky
with
his
brains
as
i
am
with
my
hands
he
must
be
a
politician
and
a
spy
because
i
love
excitement
why
i
called
you
a
spy
if
you
were
one
you
might
have
admitted
it
and
then
we
could
have
been
friends
like
two
yolks
in
one
eggshell
but
i
see
you
only
a
shell
without
a
yolk
in
it
who
cleaned
you
how
long
have
you
been
in
the
service
of
ramsden
effendi
yussuf
dakmar
asked
him
not
long
and
i
am
tired
of
it
he
is
strong
and
his
fist
is
heavy
when
he
gets
drunk
he
is
difficult
to
carry
upstairs
to
bed
and
if
i
am
also
drunk
the
feat
is
still
more
difficult
it
is
a
mystery
how
such
a
man
as
he
should
be
entrusted
with
a
secret
mission
for
he
drinks
with
anyone
aha
he
scowls
at
me
because
i
tell
the
truth
about
him
but
if
i
had
a
bottle
of
whisky
to
offer
him
he
would
soon
look
pleasant
again
and
would
give
me
a
drink
too
when
he
had
swallowed
all
he
could
hold
if
he
had
really
been
my
servant
i
would
naturally
have
kicked
him
off
the
train
for
a
fraction
of
such
impudence
i
did
exactly
know
what
to
do
there
is
a
thoughtful
motive
behind
every
apparently
random
absurdity
that
jeremy
gets
off
but
i
was
uncomfortably
conscious
of
the
fact
that
my
wits
do
work
fast
enough
to
follow
such
volatile
manoeuvres
perhaps
it
the
scotian
blood
in
me
i
can
follow
a
practical
argument
fast
enough
when
the
axioms
are
all
laid
down
and
we
agreed
on
the
subject
however
grim
came
to
my
rescue
he
had
his
pencil
out
and
contrived
to
flick
a
piece
of
paper
into
my
lap
unseen
by
yussuf
dakmar
jeremy
cue
is
good
the
note
ran
dismiss
him
for
talking
about
you
to
a
stranger
trust
him
to
do
the
rest
so
i
acted
the
part
of
an
habitually
heavy
drinker
in
a
fit
of
sudden
rage
and
dismissed
jeremy
from
my
service
on
the
spot
very
well
he
answered
blandly
allah
makes
all
things
easy
let
us
hope
that
other
fellow
finds
it
easy
to
put
you
to
bed
tonight
allah
is
likewise
good
for
i
have
my
ticket
to
damascus
and
all
i
need
to
beg
for
is
a
bed
and
food
at
haifa
i
muttered
something
in
reply
about
his
impudence
and
the
conversation
ceased
abruptly
but
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
or
so
yussuf
dakmar
went
out
into
the
corridor
signaling
to
jeremy
to
follow
him
chapter
viii
he
forgive
anyone
who
brings
him
whiskey
you
remember
of
course
that
line
that
shakespeare
put
into
the
mouth
of
puck
what
fools
these
mortals
be
the
biggest
fools
are
the
extra
smart
ones
whose
pride
and
peculiar
joy
it
is
to
beat
the
game
yussuf
dakmar
assessed
all
other
humans
as
grist
for
his
mill
character
to
him
was
expressed
in
degrees
of
folly
and
sheer
badness
virtue
existed
only
as
a
weakness
to
be
exploited
the
question
that
always
exercised
him
was
wherein
does
the
other
fellow
weakness
lie
it
a
form
of
madness
where
a
sane
man
looks
for
strength
and
honesty
that
he
can
yoke
up
with
a
yussuf
dakmar
spies
out
human
failings
and
whereas
most
of
us
in
our
day
have
mistaken
pyrites
for
fine
gold
which
did
not
hurt
more
than
was
good
for
us
he
ends
by
mistaking
gold
for
dross
you
can
persuade
such
a
man
without
the
slightest
difficulty
that
you
are
a
fool
and
a
crook
jeremy
had
turned
the
trick
for
his
own
amusement
as
much
as
anything
although
his
natural
vein
of
shrewdness
probably
suggested
the
idea
yussuf
dakmar
ready
to
believe
all
evil
and
no
good
of
anyone
was
convinced
that
he
had
to
deal
with
a
brained
arab
who
could
be
used
for
almost
any
purpose
and
riotous
bent
for
jumping
from
one
thing
to
another
fixed
the
delusion
still
more
firmly
but
lord
he
had
caught
a
tartar
outside
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
in
full
view
but
out
of
earshot
of
narayan
singh
yussuf
dakmar
made
a
proposal
to
jeremy
that
was
almost
perfect
in
its
naive
obliquity
there
was
nothing
original
or
even
unusual
about
it
except
the
circumstances
time
and
place
men
and
stock
salesmen
touts
and
politicians
get
away
with
the
same
proposition
in
the
every
day
of
the
week
and
pocket
millions
by
it
only
just
as
happens
to
all
such
gentry
on
occasion
yussuf
dakmar
had
the
wrong
fish
in
his
net
he
jerked
his
head
toward
where
narayan
singh
sat
stolid
and
looking
on
a
with
his
curly
black
beard
resting
on
the
heel
of
one
hand
do
you
know
that
man
he
asked
wallah
how
should
i
know
him
jeremy
answered
he
looks
like
a
hindu
thinking
of
reincarnation
inshallah
he
will
turn
into
a
tiger
presently
beware
of
him
he
is
an
administration
spy
he
is
watching
me
talk
to
you
and
perhaps
he
will
ask
you
afterward
what
i
have
said
you
must
be
very
careful
how
you
answer
him
i
will
tell
him
you
asked
me
for
a
for
the
wife
jeremy
answered
i
am
listening
what
is
it
you
are
really
going
to
say
that
master
of
yours
that
ramsden
who
dismissed
you
so
tyrannically
just
now
that
drunkard
there
is
nothing
interesting
to
be
said
about
him
jeremy
answered
he
is
a
fool
who
has
paid
my
fare
as
far
as
damascus
may
allah
reward
him
for
it
are
you
telling
me
the
truth
demanded
yussuf
dakmar
fixing
his
eyes
sternly
on
jeremy
your
con
man
never
overlooks
a
chance
to
put
his
intended
victim
on
the
defensive
at
an
early
stage
in
the
proceedings
how
can
he
have
paid
your
fare
as
far
as
damascus
this
line
only
goes
to
haifa
where
you
have
to
change
trains
and
buy
another
ticket
i
see
you
are
a
clever
devil
jeremy
retorted
may
allah
give
you
a
belly
ache
if
that
is
where
you
keep
your
brains
it
was
i
who
bought
the
tickets
the
fool
gave
me
sufficient
money
for
three
fares
all
the
way
to
damascus
and
i
have
the
change
he
forgot
that
when
he
dismissed
me
then
you
wo
need
to
beg
board
and
lodging
in
haifa
oh
yes
i
need
my
money
for
another
matter
it
is
high
time
i
married
and
a
fellow
without
money
has
to
put
up
with
any
toothless
that
nobody
else
will
take
so
you
hope
to
find
a
wife
in
damascus
inshallah
jeremy
answered
piously
well
i
will
find
you
a
girl
for
wife
provided
you
first
prove
that
you
will
make
a
good
i
take
men
as
i
find
them
not
as
they
represent
themselves
he
who
wishes
for
the
fire
must
first
chop
wood
you
understand
me
wallah
i
can
chop
wood
like
an
axe
with
two
heads
is
the
woman
your
daughter
that
is
as
may
be
let
us
talk
business
i
reward
my
friends
but
woe
betide
the
fool
who
betrays
my
confidence
said
yussuf
dakmar
darkly
i
see
you
are
a
man
after
my
own
heart
answered
jeremy
a
thorough
fellow
who
stops
at
nothing
good
allah
must
have
brought
us
two
together
for
an
evil
purpose
being
doubtless
weary
of
the
league
of
nations
unbosom
i
am
like
a
well
into
which
men
drop
things
and
never
see
them
any
more
you
are
a
fine
rascal
i
can
see
that
clearly
so
you
think
that
allah
is
cooking
up
evil
do
you
that
is
an
original
idea
and
there
may
be
something
in
it
let
us
hope
there
is
something
in
it
for
us
two
at
all
events
now
as
to
that
fellow
ramsden
avoid
him
unless
he
is
drunk
advised
jeremy
the
weight
of
his
fist
would
drive
a
man
like
you
like
a
nail
into
a
tree
who
fears
such
an
ox
the
syrian
retorted
a
fly
can
sting
him
a
little
knife
can
bleed
him
a
red
rag
can
enrage
him
and
the
crows
who
devour
that
sort
of
meat
wo
worry
as
to
whether
he
was
killed
according
to
ritual
he
has
money
for
feisul
has
he
well
never
mind
he
has
a
letter
as
well
and
that
is
what
i
want
will
you
get
it
for
me
do
you
need
it
badly
by
allah
i
must
have
it
by
allah
then
i
am
in
good
luck
for
that
makes
me
indispensable
does
it
and
an
indispensable
man
can
demand
what
he
pleases
not
at
all
yussuf
dakmar
answered
frowning
i
have
taken
a
fancy
to
you
or
i
would
see
you
to
the
devil
when
we
reach
haifa
ten
or
even
twenty
men
will
present
themselves
to
do
this
business
for
me
or
if
i
choose
i
can
use
that
fellow
omar
who
is
travelling
with
ramsden
he
would
like
to
be
my
accomplice
but
i
do
trust
him
very
much
in
that
you
are
perfectly
right
answered
jeremy
he
is
not
at
all
the
sort
of
man
for
you
to
trust
it
would
surprise
me
to
learn
that
he
has
warned
ramsden
against
you
already
better
beware
of
him
according
to
jeremy
account
of
the
conversation
afterward
it
was
not
until
that
moment
that
he
saw
clearly
how
to
prevent
yussuf
dakmar
from
calling
in
thugs
to
attack
me
either
at
haifa
or
at
some
point
between
there
and
damascus
until
then
he
had
been
feeling
his
way
along
spieling
as
he
calls
it
keeping
his
man
interested
while
he
made
all
ready
for
the
next
trick
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
went
on
omar
is
that
fellow
real
name
he
is
a
sharp
one
and
he
is
after
the
letter
every
bit
as
much
as
you
are
how
do
you
know
that
wallah
how
not
because
he
himself
told
me
just
like
you
he
tried
to
get
me
into
partnership
he
offered
me
a
big
reward
but
he
not
like
you
so
i
did
believe
him
and
he
has
no
daughter
i
no
use
for
a
man
who
has
a
daughter
what
he
afraid
of
is
that
someone
else
may
get
the
letter
first
and
he
a
desperate
fellow
he
told
me
his
intentions
and
whether
you
believe
me
or
not
they
worthy
of
a
wolf
i
glad
i
resolved
to
take
you
into
my
confidence
said
yussuf
dakmar
nodding
go
on
i
listening
tell
me
what
he
told
you
he
plans
to
get
hold
of
the
letter
between
haifa
and
damascus
he
thinks
that
safest
because
it
over
the
border
and
there
wo
be
any
british
officers
to
interfere
somewhere
up
the
lebanon
valley
after
most
of
the
passengers
have
left
the
train
looks
good
to
him
but
i
think
he
knows
who
you
are
yes
he
knows
me
go
on
and
he
afraid
you
get
help
and
forestall
him
so
he
going
to
watch
ramsden
like
a
cat
watching
a
and
he
going
to
watch
you
too
and
if
anybody
tries
to
interfere
at
haifa
or
if
men
get
on
the
train
between
haifa
and
damascus
who
look
like
being
accomplices
of
yours
he
going
to
murder
ramsden
there
and
then
seize
the
letter
and
make
a
jump
for
it
you
see
he
one
of
those
mean
fellows
a
regular
he
rather
get
caught
by
the
police
and
hanged
for
murder
than
let
anybody
else
get
what
he
after
oh
believe
me
i
did
trust
him
i
laughed
when
he
made
his
proposal
to
me
now
that
is
very
interesting
said
yussuf
dakmar
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
had
a
little
experience
with
him
last
night
myself
he
came
on
me
by
accident
in
a
certain
place
and
we
conversed
i
pretended
to
agree
with
him
for
the
sake
of
appearances
but
i
formed
a
very
poor
opinion
of
him
well
suppose
we
put
him
out
of
the
way
first
how
would
that
be
you
look
like
a
strong
man
suppose
you
watch
for
an
opportunity
to
push
him
off
the
train
oh
that
would
never
do
jeremy
answered
shaking
his
head
from
side
to
side
you
must
forget
that
indian
who
sits
in
the
corridor
it
was
you
yourself
who
told
me
he
is
an
administration
spy
if
he
suspects
you
already
he
will
suspect
me
for
having
talked
with
you
and
will
watch
me
and
if
i
try
to
push
that
fellow
omar
off
the
train
he
will
come
to
the
rescue
surely
you
do
expect
me
to
fight
both
of
them
at
once
besides
you
must
consider
ramsden
that
fellow
ramsden
is
big
and
strong
but
he
is
a
nervous
wreck
give
him
the
least
excuse
and
he
will
yell
for
the
police
like
a
baby
crying
for
its
mother
he
looks
on
omar
as
his
bodyguard
now
that
he
has
dismissed
me
and
if
omar
should
get
killed
or
disappear
between
here
and
haifa
ramsden
would
demand
an
escort
of
police
in
fact
i
think
he
lose
courage
altogether
and
put
that
letter
in
a
in
the
haifa
bank
what
is
the
letter
anyway
what
in
it
how
much
will
you
pay
me
if
i
get
it
for
you
never
mind
what
in
it
will
you
get
it
that
the
point
will
you
get
it
and
bring
it
to
me
that
is
the
point
at
all
answered
jeremy
the
point
is
how
much
will
you
pay
me
if
i
do
that
very
well
i
will
pay
you
fifty
pounds
mashallah
you
must
need
it
awfully
badly
i
could
have
been
hired
for
fifty
shillings
to
do
a
much
more
dangerous
thing
well
pounds
ought
to
be
enough
i
will
pay
you
five
nothing
less
than
fifty
jeremy
retorted
i
always
get
fifty
of
everything
fifty
lashes
in
the
jail
fifty
beans
at
fifty
pairs
of
boots
to
clean
for
ramsden
fifty
is
my
lucky
number
i
have
made
attempts
to
get
married
and
the
next
time
i
shall
succeed
if
it
is
the
woman
lucky
number
too
that
her
affair
show
me
the
fifty
pounds
i
have
that
much
with
me
answered
yussuf
dakmar
i
will
pay
you
in
damascus
all
right
then
i
will
give
you
the
letter
in
damascus
no
no
get
it
as
soon
as
possible
i
will
and
give
it
to
me
immediately
then
if
you
like
you
can
stay
close
to
me
until
i
pay
you
in
damascus
ass
is
invited
to
a
wedding
to
carry
wood
and
water
and
they
beat
him
with
one
of
the
sticks
he
carried
jeremy
quoted
no
no
no
i
will
get
the
letter
for
i
know
how
after
i
have
it
you
may
keep
close
to
me
until
we
reach
damascus
i
will
show
it
to
you
but
i
wo
give
it
to
you
until
after
i
get
the
fifty
pounds
very
well
since
you
are
so
untrustful
untrustful
i
am
possessed
by
a
demon
of
mistrust
why
because
i
know
i
am
not
the
worst
person
in
the
world
and
what
i
can
think
of
another
might
do
now
if
you
were
i
and
i
were
you
which
god
forbid
because
i
am
a
happy
fellow
and
you
look
bilious
and
you
stole
the
letter
for
me
because
i
promised
to
pay
you
in
damascus
but
give
me
the
letter
until
i
paid
you
do
you
know
what
i
would
think
of
doing
i
would
promise
a
few
tough
fellows
ten
pounds
among
them
to
murder
you
thus
i
would
get
the
letter
and
save
forty
pounds
ah
but
i
am
not
that
kind
of
man
said
yussuf
dakmar
well
you
will
learn
what
kind
of
man
you
are
in
the
next
world
when
you
reach
the
judgment
seat
what
is
most
interesting
now
is
the
kind
of
fellow
i
am
i
will
steal
the
letter
from
ramsden
and
keep
it
until
you
pay
me
in
damascus
but
i
sha
sleep
and
i
shall
watch
you
and
if
i
suspect
you
of
making
plans
to
have
me
robbed
or
murdered
i
shall
make
such
a
noise
that
everybody
will
come
running
and
then
i
shall
be
a
celebrity
but
they
put
you
in
jail
very
well
you
steal
the
letter
and
i
keep
close
to
you
said
yussuf
dakmar
but
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
now
that
ramsden
has
dismissed
you
from
his
service
oh
that
easy
you
get
me
some
whisky
and
i
take
it
to
him
for
a
peace
offering
he
forgive
anyone
who
brings
him
whisky
that
is
quite
an
idea
yes
now
how
can
i
get
whisky
on
the
train
if
only
i
could
get
some
i
have
a
little
soporific
in
a
paper
packet
that
could
be
mixed
with
the
whisky
to
make
him
sleep
soundly
wait
here
while
i
walk
down
the
train
and
see
what
i
can
find
yussuf
dakmar
was
gone
twenty
minutes
and
whether
he
begged
bought
or
stole
did
not
transpire
but
he
returned
with
a
pint
flask
containing
stuff
that
looked
and
smelt
enough
like
whisky
to
get
by
if
there
had
been
a
label
on
the
bottle
he
poured
a
powder
into
it
in
presence
the
two
of
them
squatting
on
the
floor
of
the
corridor
with
the
bottle
between
them
so
that
no
one
else
might
see
what
was
taking
place
now
you
would
better
get
rid
of
that
fellow
omar
while
you
attend
to
this
yussuf
dakmar
cautioned
him
can
you
think
of
any
way
of
doing
that
oh
easily
jeremy
answered
he
is
a
great
one
for
the
women
i
will
tell
him
there
is
a
pretty
armenian
girl
in
the
car
behind
he
will
run
like
any
other
turk
to
have
a
good
look
at
her
very
well
i
will
wait
here
but
understand
now
i
am
a
dangerous
man
you
have
fortune
in
one
hand
but
destruction
in
the
other
very
well
but
this
may
take
me
an
hour
and
if
you
grow
impatient
and
that
indian
sees
you
peering
into
the
compartment
after
having
watched
you
and
me
talking
all
this
time
he
grow
suspicious
all
right
i
go
to
the
car
behind
as
soon
as
you
have
the
letter
come
and
tell
me
so
jeremy
came
back
and
entertained
grim
and
me
with
a
burlesque
account
of
the
interview
after
whispering
to
narayan
singh
to
give
the
alarm
in
the
event
of
yussuf
dakmar
returning
forward
to
spy
on
us
grim
put
the
doped
whisky
into
his
valise
after
a
sniff
at
it
instead
of
throwing
it
out
of
the
window
at
my
suggestion
and
after
a
suitable
interval
he
went
out
in
the
part
of
the
turk
to
look
for
the
imaginary
beautiful
armenian
then
i
gave
jeremy
the
fake
letter
back
and
went
to
sleep
so
it
no
use
asking
me
what
the
country
looks
like
between
ludd
and
haifa
i
did
even
wake
up
to
see
the
lake
of
tiberias
sea
of
galilee
or
bahr
tubariya
as
it
is
variously
called
a
rather
common
sickness
is
what
sir
richard
burton
called
holylanditis
and
i
had
it
as
well
as
the
croup
and
measles
in
my
youth
some
folk
never
recover
from
it
and
to
them
a
rather
ordinary
sheet
of
water
and
ugly
modern
villages
built
on
ruins
look
like
the
pictures
that
an
opium
smoker
sees
the
ruins
and
the
history
do
interest
me
but
you
ca
see
them
from
the
train
and
after
a
night
without
sleep
there
seemed
to
me
something
more
profitable
in
view
than
to
hang
from
a
window
and
buy
fish
that
undoubtedly
had
once
swum
in
galilee
water
but
that
cost
a
most
unrighteous
price
and
stank
as
if
straight
from
a
garbage
heap
the
whole
train
reeked
of
putrid
fish
when
we
reached
haifa
in
the
evening
in
time
to
watch
the
sun
go
down
across
the
really
glorious
bay
of
acre
chapter
ix
the
rest
will
be
simple
haifa
was
crowded
with
syrians
of
all
sorts
and
there
were
two
or
three
staff
officers
in
the
uniform
of
feisul
army
lounging
on
the
platform
who
conned
new
arrivals
with
a
sort
of
childlike
solicitude
as
if
by
looking
in
a
man
face
they
could
judge
whether
he
was
friendly
to
their
cause
or
not
mabel
had
wired
to
her
friend
and
was
met
at
the
station
so
we
had
nothing
to
worry
over
for
the
present
on
her
score
our
own
troubles
began
when
we
reached
the
only
hotel
and
found
it
crowded
the
proprietor
a
little
wizened
pockmarked
arab
in
a
black
alpaca
jacket
and
yellow
pants
with
a
tarboosh
balanced
forward
at
a
pessimistic
angle
suggested
that
there
might
be
guests
in
the
hotel
who
would
let
us
share
their
beds
although
there
will
be
no
reduction
of
the
price
to
either
party
in
that
event
he
hastened
to
explain
it
was
a
wonder
of
an
hotel
you
could
smell
the
bugs
and
the
sanitary
arrangements
from
the
step
and
although
the
whole
place
had
been
dirt
from
all
over
the
near
east
was
accumulating
on
the
dead
white
making
it
look
leprous
and
depressing
the
place
fronted
on
a
main
street
with
its
back
toward
the
bay
of
acre
at
a
point
where
scavengers
used
the
beach
for
a
dumping
place
there
was
a
hostel
of
british
officers
about
a
mile
away
where
grim
might
have
been
able
to
procure
beds
for
the
whole
party
but
i
noticed
no
less
than
five
men
who
followed
us
up
from
the
station
and
seemed
to
be
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
yussuf
dakmar
and
it
was
a
sure
bet
that
if
we
should
show
our
hands
so
far
as
to
mess
with
british
officers
the
train
next
day
would
be
packed
with
men
to
whom
murder
would
be
simple
amusement
yet
grim
and
jeremy
needed
sleep
and
so
did
narayan
singh
we
offered
to
rent
an
outhouse
for
the
night
a
cellar
the
roof
but
there
was
nothing
doing
and
it
was
yussuf
dakmar
at
last
who
solved
the
problem
for
us
he
found
a
crony
of
his
who
had
occupied
for
several
days
a
room
containing
two
beds
with
generosity
accompanied
however
by
a
peculiar
display
of
yellow
teeth
and
more
of
the
jaundiced
whites
of
his
eyes
than
i
cared
to
see
this
individual
offered
to
go
elsewhere
for
the
night
and
to
place
the
room
at
my
disposal
but
there
is
this
about
it
he
explained
where
i
am
going
there
is
no
room
for
my
friend
yussuf
dakmar
bey
so
i
must
ask
you
to
let
him
share
this
with
you
you
and
he
could
each
have
a
bed
of
course
but
it
seems
to
me
that
your
servants
look
wearier
than
you
do
i
suggest
then
that
you
take
one
bed
effendi
and
share
it
with
my
friend
yussuf
dakmar
bey
leaving
the
other
to
your
servants
who
i
hope
will
be
suitably
grateful
for
the
consideration
shown
them
grim
nodded
to
me
from
behind
the
syrians
backs
and
i
jumped
at
the
offer
payment
was
refused
the
man
explained
that
he
had
the
room
by
the
week
and
the
loan
of
it
to
me
for
one
night
would
cost
him
nothing
in
fact
he
acted
courteously
and
with
considerable
evidence
of
breeding
merely
requesting
my
permission
to
lock
the
big
closet
where
he
kept
his
personal
belongings
and
to
take
the
key
away
with
him
even
if
we
had
been
in
a
mood
to
cavil
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
fault
for
it
was
a
spacious
clean
and
airy
room
three
characteristics
each
of
which
is
as
scarce
as
the
other
in
that
part
of
the
world
the
beds
stood
foot
to
foot
along
the
right
wall
as
you
entered
against
the
opposite
wall
was
a
cheap
wooden
and
an
enormous
closet
built
of
olive
wood
sunk
into
a
deep
recess
the
thing
was
about
eight
feet
wide
and
reached
to
the
ceiling
you
could
tell
the
depth
because
he
locked
it
at
once
and
pocketed
the
key
and
it
fitted
into
the
recess
so
neatly
that
a
would
hardly
have
gone
into
the
crack
outside
the
bedroom
door
in
a
lobby
furnished
with
odds
and
ends
was
a
wickerwork
sofa
that
would
do
finely
for
narayan
singh
and
that
old
soldier
did
need
to
have
it
pointed
out
to
him
without
word
or
sign
from
us
he
threw
his
kit
on
the
floor
unrolled
his
blankets
removed
his
boots
curled
up
on
the
sofa
and
if
he
did
go
to
sleep
at
once
gave
such
a
perfect
imitation
of
it
that
somebody
fox
terrier
came
and
sniffed
him
and
recognizing
a
campaigner
after
his
own
wandering
heart
jumped
on
his
chest
and
settled
down
to
sleep
too
as
soon
as
our
host
had
left
the
room
all
bows
and
toothy
smiles
jeremy
with
his
back
to
me
drew
from
one
pocket
the
letter
he
was
supposed
to
have
stolen
from
me
flourished
it
in
yussuf
dakmar
face
and
concealed
it
carefully
in
another
then
a
new
humorous
notion
occurred
to
him
he
pulled
it
out
again
folded
it
in
the
pocket
wallet
in
which
he
had
carried
it
from
the
first
wrapped
the
whole
in
a
handkerchief
which
he
knotted
carefully
and
then
handed
it
to
me
effendi
he
said
you
are
a
fierce
master
and
a
mighty
drunkard
but
a
man
without
guile
keep
that
till
the
morning
then
if
omar
wants
to
steal
it
he
will
have
to
murder
you
instead
of
me
and
i
would
rather
sleep
than
die
but
you
must
give
it
back
at
dawn
because
the
prayers
are
in
it
that
a
very
holy
wrote
for
me
and
unless
i
read
those
prayers
properly
tomorrow
train
will
come
to
grief
before
we
reach
damascus
he
acted
the
part
perfectly
of
one
of
those
wholly
shrewd
mountebanks
who
pick
up
a
living
by
taking
advantage
of
tolerance
and
good
nature
you
all
seen
the
type
it
commonest
at
but
you
find
it
anywhere
in
the
world
where
vagrant
men
of
means
foregather
again
yussuf
dakmar
face
became
a
picture
of
suppressed
emotion
i
pocketed
the
wallet
with
the
same
air
with
which
i
have
accepted
a
servant
money
to
keep
safe
for
him
scores
of
times
he
believed
me
to
be
a
drunkard
who
had
been
thoroughly
doped
that
day
and
would
probably
drink
hard
that
night
to
drown
the
it
ought
to
be
easy
to
rob
me
while
i
slept
any
fool
could
have
read
his
thoughts
he
came
down
and
ate
supper
with
us
at
a
trestle
table
in
the
dimly
lighted
and
i
encouraged
his
optimism
by
ordering
two
bottles
of
whisky
to
take
upstairs
jeremy
who
ca
be
happy
unless
playing
his
part
for
all
it
worth
became
devoutly
religious
and
made
a
tremendous
fuss
because
ham
was
put
on
the
table
he
accused
the
proprietor
of
using
pig
fat
to
smear
all
the
cooking
utensils
demanded
to
see
the
kitchen
and
finally
refused
to
eat
anything
but
leban
which
is
a
sort
of
curds
if
yussuf
dakmar
had
entertained
suspicions
of
jeremy
real
nationality
they
were
all
resolved
by
the
time
that
meal
was
finished
but
the
five
men
who
had
followed
us
from
the
station
sat
in
the
dark
at
a
table
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
and
watched
every
move
we
made
when
the
coffee
was
brought
i
sat
smoking
and
surly
over
it
as
if
my
head
ached
from
the
day
drink
grim
and
jeremy
aching
for
sleep
but
refusing
like
good
artists
to
neglect
a
detail
of
their
part
went
to
another
table
and
played
backgammon
betting
quarrelsomely
and
at
last
one
of
the
five
men
walked
over
and
touched
yussuf
dakmar
shoulder
at
once
he
followed
all
five
of
them
out
of
the
room
whereat
grim
and
jeremy
promptly
went
to
bed
it
was
so
obviously
my
turn
to
stay
awake
that
grim
did
even
trouble
to
remind
me
of
it
so
i
took
the
whisky
upstairs
noticed
that
narayan
singh
was
missing
from
the
couch
where
he
had
gone
to
sleep
although
the
was
snoring
so
loud
in
his
blankets
that
i
had
to
look
twice
in
the
dim
light
i
mentioned
that
fact
to
grim
who
merely
smiled
as
he
got
between
the
sheets
then
i
went
down
to
the
street
to
get
exercise
and
fresh
air
i
did
go
far
but
strode
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
hotel
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
in
each
direction
keeping
in
the
middle
of
the
street
i
had
made
the
fourth
or
fifth
turn
when
narayan
singh
came
out
and
accosted
me
under
the
lamplight
pardon
he
called
aloud
in
english
does
the
sahib
know
where
i
can
find
a
druggist
open
at
this
hour
i
have
a
toothache
and
need
medicine
come
and
i
show
you
a
place
said
i
with
the
patronizing
air
of
a
tourist
showing
off
his
knowledge
and
we
strode
along
together
down
the
street
he
holding
one
hand
to
his
jaw
thus
and
so
it
happened
sahib
he
began
as
soon
as
we
had
gone
a
safe
distance
i
lay
sleeping
having
kept
my
belly
empty
that
i
might
wake
easily
there
came
yussuf
dakmar
and
five
men
brushing
by
me
and
they
all
went
into
a
room
four
doors
beyond
the
sahib
the
room
next
beyond
that
one
is
occupied
by
an
officer
sahib
who
fought
at
alongside
my
battalion
between
him
and
me
is
a
certain
understanding
based
on
past
happenings
in
which
we
both
had
a
hand
he
is
not
as
some
other
sahibs
but
a
man
who
opens
both
ears
and
his
heart
and
when
i
knocked
on
his
door
he
opened
it
and
recognized
me
said
he
not
come
and
see
me
in
the
morning
said
i
the
sake
of
let
me
in
quickly
and
close
the
door
so
he
did
wondering
and
not
pleased
to
be
disturbed
by
a
sikh
at
such
an
hour
and
i
said
to
him
said
i
i
a
badmash
a
scoundrel
said
he
unless
you
changed
your
morals
when
you
left
the
service
said
i
am
still
in
the
service
said
he
then
go
listening
again
in
land
said
i
and
he
whistled
softly
there
not
a
roof
below
your
window
i
asked
him
and
he
nodded
let
me
use
it
sahib
and
return
the
same
way
presently
so
he
threw
back
the
shutter
asking
no
more
questions
and
i
climbed
out
the
window
of
the
room
where
yussuf
dakmar
and
the
five
were
stood
open
but
the
lattice
shutter
was
closed
tight
so
that
i
could
stand
up
on
the
flat
roof
of
the
kitchen
and
listen
without
being
seen
and
sahib
i
could
recognize
the
snarl
of
yussuf
dakmar
voice
even
before
my
ear
was
laid
to
the
open
lattice
he
was
like
a
dog
at
bay
the
other
five
were
angry
with
him
they
were
accusing
him
of
playing
false
they
swore
that
a
great
sum
could
be
had
for
that
letter
which
they
should
share
between
them
said
a
voice
i
did
not
recognize
the
french
will
pay
one
price
they
will
pay
another
what
does
money
matter
to
them
if
they
can
make
out
a
case
against
feisul
will
they
not
have
syria
the
thing
is
simple
as
twice
two
said
he
huntsman
urges
on
the
hounds
but
unless
he
is
cleverer
than
they
who
eats
the
meat
the
french
regard
us
as
animals
i
tell
you
very
well
let
us
live
up
to
the
part
and
hunt
like
animals
since
he
who
has
the
name
should
have
the
game
as
well
and
when
we
have
done
the
work
and
they
want
booty
let
them
be
made
aware
that
animals
must
eat
we
will
set
our
own
price
on
that
document
as
for
this
yussuf
dakmar
said
another
man
him
take
a
back
seat
unless
he
is
willing
to
share
and
share
alike
with
us
he
is
not
difficult
to
kill
and
at
that
sahib
yussuf
dakmar
flew
into
a
great
rage
and
called
them
fools
of
complicated
kinds
hounds
without
a
huntsman
ye
will
overrun
the
scent
said
he
and
he
spoke
more
like
a
man
than
any
of
them
although
not
as
a
man
to
be
liked
or
trusted
are
ye
to
clap
your
fat
noses
on
the
scent
i
found
and
tell
me
the
how
and
whither
of
it
it
may
be
that
i
can
get
that
letter
tonight
surely
i
can
get
it
between
this
place
and
damascus
and
no
one
can
do
that
for
i
and
i
only
know
where
it
is
nor
will
i
tell
and
they
answered
all
together
will
make
you
tell
but
he
said
that
ye
five
fools
can
do
is
to
interfere
easy
to
kill
me
is
it
well
perhaps
it
has
been
tried
but
if
so
then
though
ye
are
jackals
kites
and
vultures
all
in
one
with
the
skill
of
chemists
added
ye
can
never
extract
secret
knowledge
from
a
dead
brain
then
that
letter
will
reach
feisul
tomorrow
night
and
the
french
who
speak
of
you
now
as
of
animals
will
call
you
what
princes
noblemen
i
suppose
they
saw
the
point
of
that
sahib
for
they
changed
their
tone
without
however
becoming
friendly
to
yussuf
dakmar
thieves
of
that
sort
know
one
another
and
trust
none
and
it
is
all
a
lie
sahib
about
there
being
any
honor
among
them
fear
is
the
only
tie
that
binds
thieves
and
they
proceeded
to
make
yussuf
dakmar
afraid
there
seems
to
be
one
among
them
sahib
who
is
leader
he
has
a
thin
voice
like
a
eunuch
and
unlike
the
others
swears
seldom
this
father
of
a
thin
voice
accepted
the
situation
he
said
and
good
let
yussuf
dakmar
do
the
hunting
for
us
it
is
sufficient
that
we
hunt
yussuf
dakmar
two
of
us
occupy
the
room
next
to
ramsden
if
yussuf
dakmar
needs
aid
in
the
night
let
him
summon
us
by
scratching
with
his
nails
on
the
closet
door
the
rest
will
be
simple
there
are
four
in
this
besides
us
five
so
if
we
count
yussuf
dakmar
that
makes
ten
who
share
the
reward
shall
yussuf
dakmar
grow
fat
while
nine
of
us
starve
i
think
not
let
him
get
the
letter
and
give
it
to
me
we
will
hide
it
and
i
will
deal
with
the
french
if
he
fails
tonight
let
him
try
again
tomorrow
on
the
train
but
we
five
will
also
take
that
train
to
damascus
and
unless
that
letter
is
in
my
hands
before
the
journey
end
then
yussuf
dakmar
dies
is
that
agreed
all
except
yussuf
dakmar
agreed
to
it
he
was
very
angry
and
called
them
leeches
whereat
they
laughed
saying
that
leeches
only
suck
enough
and
then
fall
off
whereas
they
would
take
all
or
kill
they
made
him
understand
it
taking
a
great
oath
together
to
slay
him
without
mercy
unless
he
should
get
the
letter
and
give
it
to
them
before
the
train
reaches
damascus
tomorrow
evening
well
sahib
he
agreed
presently
not
with
any
effort
at
good
grace
but
cursing
while
he
yielded
in
truth
sahib
it
is
less
fear
than
lack
of
sleep
that
yussuf
dakmar
feels
i
could
hear
him
yawn
through
the
window
lattice
now
a
man
in
that
condition
is
likely
to
act
early
in
the
night
for
fear
that
sleep
may
otherwise
get
the
better
of
him
and
the
sahib
will
do
well
to
be
keenly
alert
from
the
first
i
shall
be
asleep
on
that
couch
outside
the
door
and
will
come
if
called
so
the
sahib
would
better
not
lock
the
door
but
should
call
loud
in
case
of
need
because
i
also
have
been
long
awake
and
may
sleep
heavily
suppose
i
walk
the
streets
all
night
said
i
would
that
foil
them
nay
sahib
but
the
reverse
for
if
yussuf
dakmar
should
miss
you
after
midnight
he
would
go
in
search
of
you
with
those
five
in
turn
tracking
him
and
as
for
finding
you
that
would
be
a
simple
matter
for
every
night
thief
and
beggar
waiting
for
the
dawn
would
give
attention
to
such
a
big
man
as
you
and
would
report
your
movements
all
six
would
come
on
you
in
the
dark
and
would
kill
you
surely
then
as
if
that
were
not
bad
enough
having
searched
you
they
would
learn
that
the
letter
in
your
possession
is
not
the
right
one
and
the
trail
of
the
right
one
would
be
that
much
easier
to
detect
then
come
with
me
said
i
and
we
make
a
night
of
it
together
you
and
i
can
defend
ourselves
against
those
six
doubtless
sahib
but
my
place
is
within
hail
of
jimgrim
no
it
is
best
that
you
see
this
matter
through
tonight
between
four
walls
only
remember
sahib
that
though
a
man
on
duty
may
feign
sleep
it
is
wiser
not
to
because
sleep
steals
on
us
unawares
so
i
returned
to
the
bedroom
where
grim
and
jeremy
were
snoring
a
halleluja
chorus
but
yussuf
dakmar
had
returned
yet
i
took
advantage
of
the
syrian
absence
to
open
grim
valise
remove
the
bottle
of
doped
whisky
and
set
it
on
the
table
close
to
the
window
beside
the
two
bottles
that
i
had
bought
downstairs
one
of
which
for
the
sake
of
appearances
i
opened
just
as
yussuf
dakmar
entered
smiling
to
conceal
anxiety
chapter
x
you
made
a
bad
break
that
time
grim
was
in
mephistophelian
humor
he
can
sleep
for
sixty
seconds
at
a
time
with
all
his
wits
about
him
in
the
intervals
and
likes
to
feel
in
the
crook
of
his
own
forefinger
the
hidden
of
events
i
do
think
jeremy
was
awake
when
i
first
entered
the
room
although
it
suited
grim
humor
that
he
should
be
presently
but
you
would
have
sworn
they
were
both
unconscious
judging
by
the
bass
and
baritone
snoring
i
poured
out
whisky
drank
a
little
of
it
grouchily
and
watched
yussuf
dakmar
into
bed
he
did
take
many
of
his
clothes
off
and
even
by
you
could
see
the
shape
of
the
knife
concealed
under
his
shirt
he
sat
on
the
bed
presumably
praying
and
as
i
did
like
the
look
of
him
i
blew
out
the
candle
instantly
pinched
and
prompted
by
james
schuyler
grim
jeremy
sat
up
and
yammered
profanely
at
the
darkness
vowing
he
could
see
to
sleep
without
a
light
in
the
room
i
tinkled
a
tumbler
against
a
whisky
bottle
and
jeremy
instantly
swore
that
he
heard
burglars
sitting
up
and
whirling
his
pillow
he
knocked
yussuf
dakmar
off
the
bed
on
to
the
floor
so
i
lit
the
candle
again
after
emptying
my
glass
of
whisky
into
a
spittoon
whereat
jeremy
quoted
the
koran
about
the
fate
of
drunkards
and
getting
out
of
bed
apologized
to
yussuf
dakmar
like
a
courtier
doing
homage
to
a
king
your
honor
was
born
under
a
lucky
star
he
assured
him
i
usually
shoot
or
stab
but
the
pillow
was
the
first
thing
handy
the
syrian
had
hard
work
to
keep
his
temper
for
he
had
fallen
on
the
haft
of
the
hidden
knife
and
it
hurt
him
between
two
ribs
where
a
poorly
conditioned
man
is
extra
sensitive
however
he
mumbled
something
and
crawled
between
the
sheets
then
grim
vowed
that
he
could
sleep
with
a
light
so
i
blew
out
the
candle
and
in
about
two
minutes
the
steady
seesaw
snoring
resumed
i
took
the
opportunity
to
empty
half
the
contents
of
a
whisky
bottle
into
the
spittoon
and
after
lighting
a
pipe
proceeded
to
clink
a
tumbler
at
steady
intervals
as
evidence
of
debauch
well
under
way
except
for
the
clink
and
bump
of
the
tumbler
and
once
when
i
filled
and
relit
the
pipe
all
was
quiet
for
half
an
hour
when
yussuf
dakmar
piped
up
suddenly
and
asked
me
whether
i
did
intend
to
come
to
bed
i
will
not
trouble
you
effendi
i
will
keep
over
to
my
side
there
is
plenty
of
room
in
the
bed
for
the
two
of
us
as
he
spoke
i
heard
a
movement
of
the
bedclothes
as
grim
pinched
jeremy
awake
again
i
answered
before
jeremy
could
horn
in
hic
you
me
bed
full
o
snakes
never
sleep
as
venomous
reptiles
waiting
hic
you
stay
bed
an
keep
from
me
well
jeremy
did
want
any
better
cue
than
that
he
got
up
lit
the
candle
and
explained
to
me
with
great
wealth
of
arabic
theosophy
that
the
snakes
i
saw
were
mere
delusions
because
allah
never
made
them
and
i
tried
to
look
utterly
drunk
staring
at
him
with
dropped
jaw
and
droopy
eyelids
knocking
an
empty
bottle
over
with
my
elbow
by
way
of
calling
attention
to
it
get
into
bed
effendi
jeremy
advised
me
feeding
the
cue
back
since
i
was
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
not
into
that
bed
i
answered
shaking
my
head
solemnly
that
put
snakes
in
on
purpose
why
he
sober
when
i
drunk
i
wo
sleep
in
bed
with
sober
man
let
him
get
drun
too
an
both
see
snakes
then
i
sleep
with
him
jeremy
roving
eye
fell
on
the
small
doped
bottle
that
i
had
taken
from
grim
valise
looking
preternaturally
wise
he
walked
over
to
yussuf
dakmar
bed
sat
down
on
it
with
his
back
toward
me
and
proceeded
to
unfold
a
plan
allah
makes
all
things
easy
he
began
it
is
lawful
to
take
all
precautions
to
confound
the
infidel
we
shall
never
get
that
drunkard
to
bed
as
long
as
there
any
whisky
so
let
encourage
him
to
drink
it
all
when
it
gone
he
sleep
on
the
floor
and
we
get
some
peace
it
a
good
chance
for
us
to
drink
whisky
without
committing
sin
we
need
take
much
just
one
drink
each
and
then
he
swallow
the
rest
like
a
hog
to
prevent
our
getting
any
more
you
look
as
if
a
glass
of
whisky
would
do
you
good
that
fellow
omar
is
asleep
and
wo
see
us
so
nobody
can
tell
tales
afterwards
it
a
good
opportunity
come
on
i
had
sat
so
that
yussuf
dakmar
could
see
what
i
was
doing
and
poured
out
the
liquor
in
advance
arranging
the
glasses
so
that
yussuf
dakmar
would
take
the
doped
stuff
a
perfectly
proceeding
i
admit
christians
are
scarce
when
you
get
right
down
to
cases
most
of
us
in
extremity
prefer
shakespeare
adage
about
hoisting
engineers
it
gets
results
so
much
more
quickly
than
turning
the
other
cheek
at
any
rate
i
own
up
yussuf
dakmar
smirking
in
anticipation
of
an
easy
victory
took
the
nearest
tumbler
and
tossed
off
the
contents
in
imitation
of
free
and
easy
air
and
the
drug
acted
as
swiftly
as
the
famous
they
used
to
administer
in
the
new
york
tenderloin
he
knew
what
had
happened
before
he
lost
consciousness
for
he
tried
to
give
the
alarm
to
his
friends
he
lay
on
the
floor
opening
and
shutting
his
mouth
and
i
think
he
believed
he
was
shouting
for
help
but
after
a
minute
or
two
you
could
hardly
detect
his
breathing
and
his
face
changed
colour
as
if
he
had
been
poisoned
grim
did
even
trouble
to
get
out
of
bed
but
listened
without
comment
to
my
version
of
narayan
singh
report
and
jeremy
went
back
to
sleep
chuckling
so
i
held
a
silent
wake
over
yussuf
dakmar
keeping
some
more
of
the
doped
whisky
ready
in
case
he
should
look
like
recovering
too
soon
i
even
searched
him
finding
nothing
worthy
of
note
except
that
he
had
remarkably
little
money
i
expect
the
poor
devil
was
a
penny
ante
villain
scheming
for
a
jackpot
i
felt
really
sorry
for
him
and
turned
him
over
with
my
boot
to
let
him
breathe
better
a
little
before
dawn
i
awakened
grim
and
jeremy
and
we
left
the
room
quietly
after
i
had
scratched
on
the
closet
door
with
my
fingernails
pausing
outside
to
listen
we
heard
the
closet
door
being
opened
stealthily
from
the
far
side
i
caught
grim
eye
thinking
he
would
smile
back
but
he
looked
as
deadly
serious
as
i
have
ever
seen
him
you
made
a
bad
break
that
time
he
said
when
we
had
gone
downstairs
never
give
away
information
unless
you
getting
a
return
for
it
if
you
left
yussuf
dakmar
to
scratch
that
door
after
he
recovered
consciousness
he
have
invented
a
pack
of
lies
to
tell
his
friends
and
they
have
been
no
wiser
than
before
now
they
know
he
never
scratched
it
they
deduce
unless
they
lunatics
that
someone
overheard
their
conference
last
night
and
knew
the
signal
that
make
them
desperate
they
waste
no
more
time
on
finesse
they
use
violence
at
the
first
chance
after
the
train
leaves
haifa
rammy
like
me
he
hates
not
to
have
an
audience
for
his
tricks
put
in
jeremy
by
way
of
consolation
we
got
to
stage
a
new
play
that
all
said
grim
i
have
the
lot
of
them
arrested
but
all
the
good
that
would
do
would
be
to
inform
the
man
higher
up
who
tip
off
another
gang
by
wire
to
wait
for
us
over
the
border
say
suppose
we
all
three
bear
this
in
mind
no
play
to
the
gallery
that
where
secret
service
differs
from
other
business
applause
means
failure
the
better
the
work
you
do
the
less
you
can
afford
to
admit
you
did
it
you
must
even
smile
at
a
man
you
scored
off
half
the
game
is
to
leave
him
guessing
who
it
was
that
tripped
him
up
the
safest
course
is
to
see
that
someone
else
gets
credit
for
everything
you
do
consume
your
own
smoke
eh
suggested
jeremy
that
and
more
grim
answered
you
got
to
work
like
hell
for
what
do
you
no
good
because
the
moment
it
brings
you
recognition
it
destroys
your
usefulness
you
may
even
amuse
yourself
you
have
to
let
the
game
amuse
you
without
turning
one
trick
for
the
sake
of
an
extra
smile
most
of
the
humor
comes
in
anyhow
from
knowing
more
than
the
other
fellow
thinks
you
do
the
more
a
man
lies
the
less
you
want
to
contradict
him
because
if
you
do
he
know
that
you
know
he
lying
and
that
giving
away
information
which
is
the
unforgivable
sin
golly
exclaimed
jeremy
your
trade
would
suit
me
jim
when
doing
tricks
it
good
to
watch
folks
eyes
pop
open
what
tickles
my
is
what
i
can
see
for
myself
on
their
silly
faces
half
of
trying
to
look
as
if
they
know
how
it
done
and
the
other
half
all
grins
i
did
tricks
for
a
scotchman
once
who
got
so
angry
i
thought
he
hit
me
he
said
what
i
did
was
impossible
so
i
did
it
again
and
he
still
said
it
was
impossible
and
he
ended
by
calling
me
a
dementit
men
that
was
my
apogee
i
never
reached
that
height
since
not
even
when
i
first
made
a
camel
say
prayers
at
abu
keen
and
the
arabs
hailed
me
as
a
prophet
bread
good
but
it
better
with
the
butter
on
it
right
side
up
not
in
this
game
it
is
answered
grim
if
your
bread
seems
smeared
with
butter
that
a
sure
sign
it
dangerous
for
god
sake
as
long
as
you
stay
in
the
game
with
me
do
play
to
the
gallery
either
of
you
let
order
breakfast
it
was
the
longest
lecture
and
expression
of
opinion
i
had
ever
listened
to
from
james
schuyler
grim
and
though
i
turned
it
over
in
my
mind
a
great
deal
since
i
ca
discover
anything
but
wisdom
in
it
i
believe
he
told
jeremy
and
me
the
secret
of
power
that
morning
chapter
xi
they
are
all
right
there
was
no
competition
for
seats
on
the
damascus
train
that
morning
several
of
the
were
smashed
there
were
and
splinters
on
the
woodwork
everywhere
no
need
to
ask
questions
but
i
found
time
on
the
platform
to
chat
with
some
british
officers
while
keeping
an
eye
lifting
for
yussuf
dakmar
and
his
friends
damascus
eh
you
have
a
fine
journey
if
you
get
through
alive
nine
passengers
were
shot
dead
in
the
last
train
down
no
law
up
there
you
know
feisul
army
all
concentrated
for
a
crack
at
the
french
good
luck
to
no
i
not
wishing
the
french
any
particular
luck
this
trip
nobody
to
watch
the
bedouins
so
they
take
pot
shots
at
every
train
that
passes
just
for
the
fun
of
it
may
be
war
you
know
at
any
minute
the
french
are
sure
to
make
a
drive
for
the
railway
line
you
be
hung
up
indefinitely
commandeered
for
an
ambulance
train
shot
for
the
sake
of
argument
anything
at
all
in
fact
they
say
those
algerian
troops
are
getting
out
of
hand
paid
in
depreciated
francs
and
up
against
the
high
cost
of
debauchery
you
taking
a
chance
wish
i
could
go
have
seen
a
healthy
scrap
sinze
zeitun
ridge
hey
hullo
what
this
lovely
woman
well
i
be
it
was
mabel
ticknor
followed
by
the
six
men
i
was
watching
for
yussuf
dakmar
looking
sulky
and
discouraged
in
their
midst
almost
like
a
prisoner
and
the
other
five
wearing
palpably
innocent
expressions
lord
remarked
the
officer
nearest
me
that
gang
got
the
wind
up
look
at
the
color
of
their
gills
booked
through
i
bet
you
and
been
listening
to
tales
all
night
the
gang
drew
abreast
just
as
another
officer
gave
tongue
to
his
opinion
they
could
help
hearing
what
he
said
he
had
one
of
those
voices
that
can
carry
on
conversation
in
a
boiler
foundry
there
more
in
this
than
meets
the
eye
she
not
a
nurse
she
walk
like
a
missionary
i
heard
her
buy
a
ticket
for
aleppo
can
you
imagine
a
lone
woman
going
to
aleppo
by
that
train
unless
she
had
a
laissez
passe
from
the
french
she
wearing
french
heels
i
bet
she
carrying
secret
information
look
see
those
two
arabs
in
the
train
he
pointed
out
grim
and
jeremy
who
were
leaning
from
a
window
they
tipped
her
off
to
get
into
the
compartment
next
ahead
of
them
see
there
she
goes
she
was
for
getting
into
the
coach
ahead
they
called
her
back
almost
all
the
other
cars
were
empty
except
that
one
but
whether
because
humans
are
like
sheep
and
herd
together
instinctively
when
afraid
or
because
the
train
crew
ordered
it
all
six
compartments
of
the
middle
car
were
now
occupied
with
mabel
ticknor
alone
in
the
front
one
nevertheless
yussuf
dakmar
and
four
of
his
companions
started
to
climb
in
by
the
rear
door
the
sixth
man
lingered
within
earshot
of
the
officers
presumably
to
pick
up
further
suggestions
so
i
got
in
at
the
front
end
and
met
them
halfway
down
the
corridor
plenty
of
room
in
the
car
behind
i
said
abruptly
they
were
five
to
one
but
yussuf
dakmar
was
in
front
and
he
merely
got
in
the
way
of
the
wolves
behind
him
the
sixth
man
who
had
lingered
near
the
officers
now
entered
by
the
front
end
as
i
had
done
and
called
out
that
there
was
plenty
of
room
in
the
front
compartment
there
only
a
woman
in
here
he
said
in
arabic
and
he
set
the
example
by
taking
the
seat
opposite
to
mabel
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
to
get
him
out
again
of
course
not
even
the
polyglot
train
crew
would
have
allowed
arabs
to
trespass
without
her
invitation
the
trouble
was
that
jeremy
grim
narayan
singh
and
i
all
rushed
to
her
rescue
at
the
same
minute
which
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
it
was
doctor
ticknor
statement
in
jerusalem
about
not
wanting
to
see
any
of
us
alive
again
if
we
failed
to
bring
his
wife
back
safe
that
turned
the
trick
and
caused
even
grim
to
lose
his
head
for
a
moment
when
a
sikh
two
obvious
arabs
and
an
american
all
rush
to
a
woman
assistance
before
she
calls
for
help
there
is
evidence
of
collusion
somewhere
which
you
could
hardly
expect
a
trained
spy
to
overlook
or
fail
to
draw
conclusions
from
it
was
all
over
in
a
minute
the
rascal
left
the
compartment
muttering
to
himself
in
arabic
sotto
voce
i
caught
one
word
but
he
looked
so
diabolically
pleased
with
himself
that
it
did
really
need
that
to
stir
me
into
action
i
take
twelves
in
boots
with
a
rather
broad
toe
and
he
stopped
the
full
heft
of
the
hardest
kick
i
could
let
loose
it
put
him
out
of
action
for
half
a
day
and
remains
one
of
my
pleasantest
memories
his
companions
had
to
gather
him
up
and
help
him
fashion
into
the
car
ahead
while
an
officious
demanded
my
name
and
address
i
found
in
my
wallet
the
card
of
a
senator
and
gave
him
that
whereat
he
apologized
profoundly
and
addressed
me
as
colonel
a
title
with
which
he
continued
to
flatter
me
all
the
rest
of
the
journey
except
once
when
he
changed
it
to
admiral
by
mistake
grim
went
back
into
our
compartment
and
laughed
and
none
of
the
essays
i
have
read
on
laughter
not
even
the
famous
dissertation
by
josh
billings
throw
light
on
how
to
describe
the
tantalizing
manner
of
it
he
laughs
several
different
ways
heartily
at
times
as
men
of
my
temperament
mostly
do
boisterously
on
occasion
after
fashion
now
and
then
cryptically
using
laughter
as
a
mask
then
he
owns
a
smile
that
suggests
nothing
more
nor
less
than
kindness
based
on
understanding
of
human
nature
but
that
other
is
a
devil
of
a
laugh
mostly
made
of
chuckles
that
seem
to
bubble
off
a
of
disillusionment
and
you
get
the
impression
that
he
is
laughing
at
himself
cynically
laying
bare
the
vanity
and
fallibility
of
his
own
mental
processes
and
forecasting
there
is
no
mirth
in
it
although
there
is
amusement
no
anger
although
immeasurable
scorn
i
should
say
it
a
good
safe
laugh
to
indulge
in
for
i
think
it
is
based
on
ability
to
see
himself
and
his
own
mistakes
more
clearly
than
anybody
else
can
and
there
is
no
note
of
defeat
in
it
but
it
is
full
of
a
cruel
irony
that
brings
to
mind
a
vision
of
one
of
those
old
medieval
flagellant
priests
reviewing
his
sins
before
thrashing
his
own
body
with
a
wire
whip
so
that
ends
that
he
said
at
last
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
who
sweeps
the
pieces
from
a
board
to
set
them
up
anew
and
start
again
luckily
we
not
the
only
fools
in
asia
those
six
rascals
know
now
that
mabel
and
we
are
one
party
pooh
sneered
jeremy
what
can
the
devils
do
not
much
this
side
of
the
border
at
deraa
grim
answered
after
deraa
pretty
well
what
they
minded
they
could
have
us
pinched
on
some
charge
in
which
case
we
be
searched
mabel
included
no
we
played
too
long
on
the
defensive
deraa
is
the
the
telegraph
line
is
cut
there
and
all
messages
going
north
or
south
have
to
be
carried
by
hand
across
the
border
the
french
have
an
agent
there
who
censors
everything
he
the
boy
we
got
to
fool
if
they
appeal
to
him
this
train
will
go
on
without
us
ramsden
you
and
narayan
singh
go
and
sit
with
mabel
in
her
compartment
jeremy
you
go
forward
and
bring
yussuf
dakmar
back
here
to
me
we
let
him
have
that
fake
letter
just
before
we
reach
deraa
taking
care
somehow
to
let
the
other
five
know
he
has
it
they
discover
it
a
fake
until
after
leaving
deraa
why
not
i
interrupted
what
to
prevent
their
opening
it
at
once
two
good
reasons
for
one
we
have
narayan
singh
keep
a
careful
eye
on
them
and
they
keep
it
hidden
as
long
as
he
snoops
around
for
another
they
be
delighted
not
to
have
to
let
the
french
agent
at
deraa
into
the
secret
because
of
the
higher
price
they
hope
to
get
by
holding
on
they
smuggle
it
over
the
border
and
not
open
it
until
they
feel
safe
yes
but
when
they
do
look
at
it
said
i
we
be
over
the
border
and
they
ca
send
telegrams
to
anywhere
why
not
an
arab
government
precaution
if
station
agents
all
along
the
line
were
allowed
to
send
telegrams
every
seditious
upstart
would
take
advantage
of
it
and
they
have
more
trouble
than
they
got
now
but
i
warn
you
fellows
after
deraa
somewhere
between
the
border
and
damascus
there
be
a
fight
the
minute
they
discover
that
the
letter
is
a
fake
they
come
for
the
real
one
like
cats
after
a
canary
let
come
smiled
jeremy
but
grim
shook
his
head
i
been
making
that
mistake
too
long
he
answered
no
defensive
tactics
after
we
leave
deraa
we
start
the
trouble
ourselves
you
watch
after
deraa
the
train
crew
will
play
cards
in
the
caboose
and
leave
allah
to
care
for
the
passengers
there
only
one
thing
troubles
me
said
jeremy
what
that
narayan
singh
got
yussuf
dakmar
shirt
night
before
last
i
had
it
in
for
yussuf
ever
since
we
anzacs
went
hungry
on
account
of
him
anyone
who
scuppers
him
has
got
me
to
beat
to
him
he
my
meat
and
i
give
you
all
notice
it
is
good
to
stand
between
an
anzac
and
the
punishment
he
thinks
an
enemy
deserves
all
the
same
grim
answered
smiling
i
bet
you
do
get
him
jeremy
i
bet
you
how
much
mind
you
when
the
game
begins
you
have
a
free
hand
grim
went
on
all
right
answered
jeremy
who
loves
freak
bets
i
get
him
you
quit
the
army
soon
as
this
job
done
and
join
up
with
rammy
and
me
if
i
do
i
stay
and
help
you
on
the
next
job
that
a
bet
said
grim
promptly
so
jeremy
went
forward
to
play
at
being
traitor
while
narayan
singh
and
i
kept
mabel
company
she
fired
questions
at
us
right
and
left
for
twenty
minutes
which
we
had
to
answer
in
detail
instead
of
straining
our
cars
to
catch
what
grim
and
jeremy
might
be
saying
to
yussuf
dakmar
in
the
next
compartment
whatever
they
did
say
they
managed
to
prolong
the
interview
until
within
ten
minutes
of
deraa
when
the
syrian
returned
to
his
companions
smiling
smugly
and
narayan
singh
strode
after
him
to
stand
in
the
corridor
and
by
ostentatiously
watching
them
prevent
their
examining
the
letter
grim
and
jeremy
all
grins
joined
us
at
once
in
mabel
compartment
did
you
see
the
devil
smirk
as
he
went
off
with
it
asked
jeremy
golly
he
thinks
we
fools
the
theory
is
that
we
two
had
betrayed
you
rammy
and
swapped
the
letter
against
his
bare
promise
to
pay
us
in
damascus
he
chucked
in
a
little
blackmail
about
sicking
his
mates
on
to
murder
us
if
we
did
come
across
and
i
tell
you
we
fairly
love
him
lordy
here
deraa
if
they
open
the
thing
before
the
train
leaves
grim
says
the
lot
of
us
are
to
bolt
back
across
the
border
send
mabel
home
to
her
husband
and
continue
the
journey
by
camel
that
right
grim
grim
nodded
it
was
mabel
who
objected
i
going
to
see
this
through
she
answered
guess
again
boys
my
hair
gone
gray
you
owe
me
a
real
adventure
now
and
i
wo
give
up
the
letter
till
you
paid
we
had
one
scare
when
the
train
drew
up
in
the
squalid
station
where
the
branch
line
to
haifa
meets
the
main
hedjaz
railway
and
the
two
together
touch
a
mean
town
at
a
tangent
for
a
french
officer
in
uniform
boarded
the
train
and
stalked
down
the
corridors
staring
hard
at
everyone
he
asked
me
for
a
passport
which
was
sheer
bluff
so
i
asked
him
in
turn
for
his
own
authority
he
smiled
and
produced
a
rubber
stamp
saying
that
if
i
wished
to
visit
beirut
or
aleppo
i
must
get
a
vise
from
him
je
bien
garderai
i
answered
i
going
to
see
my
aunt
at
damascus
and
this
lady
is
she
your
wife
i
laughed
aloud
could
help
it
all
the
old
testament
stories
keep
forcing
themselves
on
your
memory
in
that
land
and
the
legend
of
abraham
trying
to
pass
his
wife
off
as
his
sister
and
the
drama
that
came
of
it
cropped
up
as
fresh
as
yesterday
there
was
no
need
that
i
could
see
to
repeat
the
patriarch
mistake
any
more
than
there
was
reasonable
basis
for
the
frenchman
impertinence
is
that
your
business
i
asked
him
because
he
went
on
smiling
meanly
you
speak
with
an
american
accent
it
is
against
the
law
to
carry
gold
across
the
border
and
americans
have
to
submit
to
personal
search
because
they
always
carry
it
show
me
your
authority
i
retorted
angrily
oh
as
for
that
there
is
a
customs
official
here
who
has
full
authority
he
is
a
syrian
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
prefer
to
be
searched
by
a
european
call
his
bluff
grim
whispered
behind
his
sleeve
but
i
intended
to
do
that
anyway
bring
along
your
syrian
said
i
and
off
he
went
to
do
it
treating
me
to
a
backward
glance
over
his
shoulder
that
conveyed
more
than
words
could
have
done
he
bluff
said
grim
but
keep
on
calling
him
i
been
searched
at
six
frontiers
said
mabel
if
it
a
syrian
i
do
much
mind
you
boys
all
come
along
and
he
behave
himself
they
much
worse
in
france
and
italy
had
one
of
you
better
take
the
letter
though
no
i
was
forgetting
already
i
wo
part
with
it
i
take
my
chance
with
the
syrian
he
only
ask
me
to
empty
my
pockets
and
prove
that
i
have
a
bag
full
of
gold
under
my
skirt
sit
tight
all
here
he
comes
the
frenchman
returned
with
a
smiling
syrian
in
tow
a
fellow
with
blue
jaws
as
dark
as
his
serge
uniform
the
frenchman
stood
aside
and
the
syrian
announced
rather
awkwardly
that
regulations
compelled
him
to
submit
mabel
and
me
to
the
inconvenience
of
search
for
what
said
i
for
gold
he
answered
it
is
against
the
law
to
smuggle
it
across
the
border
i
only
one
gold
coin
i
said
showing
him
a
piece
and
his
yellow
eyes
shone
at
sight
of
it
if
it
will
save
trouble
you
may
have
it
i
put
it
into
his
open
palm
with
the
frenchman
looking
on
and
it
was
immediately
clear
that
that
particular
syrian
official
was
no
longer
amenable
to
international
intrigue
he
was
bought
and
sold
oozy
with
gratitude
incapable
of
anything
but
wild
enthusiasm
for
the
for
several
hours
to
come
i
have
searched
them
said
he
to
the
french
officer
they
have
no
gold
and
they
are
all
right
the
french
have
faults
like
the
rest
of
us
but
they
are
quicker
than
most
men
to
recognize
logic
the
man
with
crimson
pants
and
sabre
grinned
cynically
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
passed
on
to
annoy
somebody
easier
chapter
xii
start
something
before
they
ready
for
it
just
before
the
train
started
a
handsome
fellow
with
short
black
beard
trimmed
into
a
point
and
wearing
a
european
blue
serge
suit
but
none
the
less
obviously
an
arab
came
to
the
door
of
our
compartment
and
stared
steadily
at
grim
he
stood
like
a
fighting
man
as
if
every
muscle
of
his
body
was
under
command
and
the
suggestion
was
strengthened
by
what
might
be
a
bullet
scar
over
one
eye
if
that
fellow
had
asked
me
for
a
loan
on
the
spot
or
for
help
against
his
enemies
he
would
have
received
both
or
either
moreover
if
he
had
never
paid
me
back
i
would
still
believe
in
him
and
would
bet
on
him
again
however
after
one
swift
glance
at
him
grim
took
no
notice
until
the
train
was
under
way
not
even
then
in
fact
until
the
man
in
blue
serge
spoke
first
oh
jimgrim
he
said
suddenly
in
a
voice
like
a
tenor
bell
come
in
hadad
grim
answered
hardly
glancing
at
him
make
yourself
at
home
he
tossed
a
valise
into
the
rack
and
i
gave
up
the
corner
seat
so
that
he
might
sit
facing
grim
he
acknowledging
the
courtesy
with
a
smile
like
the
whicker
of
a
wasting
no
time
on
foolish
protest
he
knew
what
he
wanted
knew
enough
to
take
it
when
invited
understood
me
and
expected
me
to
understand
him
a
fellow
he
sat
leaning
a
little
forward
his
back
not
touching
the
cushion
with
the
palms
of
both
hands
resting
on
his
knees
and
strong
fingers
motionless
he
eyed
mabel
ticknor
not
exactly
nervously
but
with
caution
any
news
asked
grim
jimgrim
the
world
is
full
of
it
he
answered
in
english
with
a
laugh
but
who
are
these
my
friends
your
intimate
friends
grim
nodded
the
lady
as
well
grim
nodded
again
that
is
very
strong
recommendation
jimgrim
grim
introduced
us
giving
jeremy
name
as
jmil
ras
hah
i
have
heard
of
you
said
hadad
staring
at
him
the
australian
who
wandered
all
over
arabia
i
am
probably
the
only
arab
who
knew
what
you
really
were
do
you
recall
that
time
at
wady
hafiz
when
a
local
priest
denounced
you
and
a
sheik
in
a
yellow
kuffiyi
told
the
crowd
that
he
knew
you
for
a
prophet
i
am
the
same
sheik
i
liked
your
pluck
i
often
wondered
what
became
of
you
put
it
here
said
jeremy
and
they
shook
hands
for
twenty
minutes
after
that
hadad
and
jeremy
swapped
reminiscences
in
quick
staccato
time
it
was
like
two
gatling
guns
playing
a
duet
and
the
score
was
about
equally
intelligible
to
anyone
unfamiliar
with
arabia
hinterland
which
is
to
say
to
all
except
about
one
person
in
ten
million
it
was
most
of
it
greek
to
me
but
grim
listened
like
an
operator
to
the
ticking
of
the
morse
code
it
was
hadad
who
cut
it
short
jeremy
would
have
talked
all
the
way
to
damascus
and
so
jimgrim
do
the
kites
foregather
or
are
we
a
forlorn
hope
do
we
go
to
bury
feisul
or
to
crown
him
king
how
much
do
you
know
grim
answered
hah
more
than
you
my
friend
i
come
from
europe
london
paris
rome
i
stopped
off
in
deraa
to
listen
a
while
where
the
tide
of
rumour
flows
back
and
forth
across
the
border
the
english
are
in
favour
of
feisul
and
would
help
him
if
they
could
the
french
are
against
him
and
would
rather
have
him
a
dead
saint
than
a
living
nuisance
the
most
disturbing
rumour
i
have
heard
was
here
in
deraa
to
the
effect
that
feisul
sent
a
letter
to
jerusalem
calling
on
all
moslems
to
rise
and
massacre
the
jews
that
does
not
sound
like
feisul
but
the
french
agent
in
deraa
assured
me
that
he
will
have
the
original
letter
in
his
hands
within
a
day
or
two
grim
smiled
over
at
mabel
you
might
show
him
the
letter
he
suggested
so
mabel
dug
down
into
the
mysteries
beneath
her
shirtwaist
and
produced
the
document
wrapped
in
a
medical
bandage
of
oiled
silk
hadad
unwrapped
it
read
it
carefully
and
handed
it
to
grim
are
you
deceived
by
that
he
asked
does
feisul
speak
like
that
or
write
like
that
since
when
has
he
turned
coward
that
he
should
sign
his
name
with
a
number
what
do
you
make
of
it
asked
grim
hah
it
is
as
plain
as
the
ink
on
the
paper
it
is
intended
for
use
against
feisul
first
by
making
the
british
suspicious
of
him
second
by
providing
the
french
with
an
excuse
to
attack
him
third
by
convicting
him
of
treachery
for
which
he
can
be
jailed
or
executed
after
he
is
caught
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
it
jimgrim
i
going
to
show
it
to
feisul
good
i
too
am
on
my
way
to
see
feisul
perhaps
the
two
of
us
together
can
convince
him
what
is
best
if
we
two
first
agree
grim
answered
with
a
dry
smile
do
you
agree
that
two
and
two
make
four
this
is
just
as
simple
jimgrim
feisul
can
not
contend
with
the
french
the
financiers
have
spread
their
net
for
syria
feisul
has
no
artillery
worth
speaking
of
no
gas
no
masks
against
gas
and
the
french
have
plenty
of
everything
except
money
syria
has
been
undermined
by
propaganda
and
corruption
let
feisul
go
to
british
territory
and
thence
to
europe
where
his
friends
may
have
a
chance
to
work
for
him
the
british
will
give
him
mesopotamia
and
after
that
it
will
be
up
to
us
arabs
to
prove
we
are
a
nation
that
is
my
argument
are
we
agreed
if
that
your
plan
hadad
i
with
you
grim
answered
then
i
also
am
with
you
let
us
shake
hands
shwai
shwai
go
slow
said
grim
better
join
up
with
me
in
damascus
there
are
six
men
in
the
car
ahead
who
try
to
murder
us
all
presently
they
got
a
letter
that
they
think
is
that
one
the
minute
they
find
out
we
fooled
them
there
be
ructions
i
am
good
at
ructions
hadad
answered
my
friend
narayan
singh
is
forward
watching
them
said
grim
what
they
probably
try
when
they
make
the
discovery
will
be
to
have
the
lot
of
us
arrested
at
some
wayside
station
i
propose
to
forestall
them
i
am
good
at
forestalling
said
hadad
then
do
you
forestall
me
laughed
jeremy
the
fellow
with
a
face
like
a
pig
stern
is
yussuf
dakmar
and
he
my
special
preserve
i
am
a
good
moslem
i
refuse
to
lay
hand
on
pig
said
hadad
smiling
we
discussed
feisul
and
the
arab
cause
oh
if
we
had
lawrence
with
us
exclaimed
hadad
excitedly
at
last
a
little
little
man
hardly
any
larger
than
ticknor
but
a
david
against
goliath
and
would
you
believe
it
there
is
an
idiotic
rumour
that
lawrence
has
returned
and
is
hiding
in
damascus
the
french
are
really
disturbed
about
it
they
have
cabled
their
foreign
office
and
received
an
official
denial
of
the
rumour
but
official
denials
carry
no
weight
nowadays
out
of
ten
frenchmen
in
syria
five
believe
that
lawrence
is
with
feisul
and
if
they
can
catch
him
he
will
get
short
shrift
but
oh
jimgrim
oh
if
it
were
true
wallahi
grim
did
answer
but
i
saw
him
look
long
at
jeremy
and
then
for
about
thirty
seconds
steadily
at
mabel
ticknor
after
that
he
stared
out
of
the
window
for
a
long
time
not
even
moving
his
head
when
a
crowd
of
bedouins
galloped
to
within
fifty
yards
of
the
train
and
volleyed
at
it
from
horseback
merely
out
of
devilment
as
hadad
hastened
to
assure
us
we
were
winding
up
the
lebanon
valley
by
that
time
carpets
of
flowers
green
grass
waterfalls
a
thatched
hut
to
the
twenty
square
miles
with
a
scattering
of
mean
black
tents
between
every
stone
building
in
ruins
goats
where
fat
kine
ought
to
be
and
a
more
or
less
modern
railway
screeching
across
the
landscape
short
of
fuel
and
oil
lebanon
we
grew
depressed
then
silent
our
meditations
were
interrupted
by
the
sudden
arrival
of
narayan
singh
in
the
door
of
the
compartment
grinning
full
of
news
they
have
opened
the
letter
sahib
they
accuse
yussuf
dakmar
of
deceiving
them
they
threaten
him
with
death
shall
i
interfere
any
sign
of
the
train
crew
grim
asked
nay
they
are
gambling
in
the
grim
looked
sharply
at
hadad
what
authority
have
you
got
none
i
am
a
personal
friend
of
feisul
that
is
all
well
we
pretend
you
power
to
arrest
them
ramsden
suddenly
missed
your
letter
you
accused
jeremy
of
stealing
it
he
has
confessed
to
selling
it
to
yussuf
dakmar
go
forward
in
a
rage
and
demand
the
letter
back
start
something
before
they
ready
for
it
we
be
just
behind
you
leave
yussuf
dakmar
to
me
insisted
jeremy
i
pay
the
debt
of
an
anzac
division
i
hope
i
never
hurt
a
man
who
did
deserve
it
or
who
was
fit
to
fight
but
i
have
to
admit
that
grim
did
need
to
repeat
the
invitation
i
started
forward
in
a
hurry
and
jeremy
elbowed
narayan
singh
aside
in
order
to
follow
next
australians
being
notoriously
performers
when
anybody
hat
is
in
the
ring
by
the
time
i
reached
the
car
ahead
the
train
had
entered
a
wild
gorge
circle
by
one
of
those
astonishing
hairpin
curves
with
which
engineers
defeat
nature
the
panting
engine
slowed
almost
to
a
snail
pace
having
only
a
scant
fuel
ration
with
which
to
negotiate
curve
and
grade
combined
to
our
right
there
was
a
nearly
sheer
drop
of
four
hundred
feet
with
a
stream
at
the
bottom
boiling
among
limestone
boulders
but
there
was
no
time
to
study
scenery
from
the
middle
compartment
of
the
car
there
came
yells
for
help
and
the
peculiar
noise
of
thump
and
scuffle
that
ca
be
mistaken
men
fight
in
various
ways
lord
knows
and
the
worst
are
the
civilized
but
from
nome
to
cape
town
and
all
the
way
from
china
to
peru
the
veriest
tenderfoot
can
tell
in
the
dark
the
difference
between
fight
and
horseplay
i
reached
the
door
of
the
compartment
in
time
to
see
three
of
them
two
bleeding
from
in
the
face
force
yussuf
dakmar
backward
toward
the
window
the
whole
lot
stabbing
frantically
as
they
milled
and
swayed
the
fifth
man
was
holding
on
to
the
scrimmage
with
his
left
hand
and
reaching
round
with
his
right
trying
to
stick
a
knife
into
yussuf
dakmar
ribs
without
endangering
his
own
hide
but
the
sixth
man
was
the
rascal
i
had
kicked
he
had
no
room
perhaps
no
inclination
to
get
into
the
scrimmage
so
he
saw
me
first
and
he
needed
no
spur
to
his
enmity
with
a
movement
as
quick
as
a
cat
and
presence
of
mind
that
accounted
for
his
being
leader
of
the
gang
he
seized
the
fifth
man
by
the
neck
and
spun
him
round
to
call
his
attention
and
the
two
came
for
me
together
like
devils
out
of
a
now
the
narrow
door
of
a
compartment
on
a
train
is
any
kind
of
easy
place
to
fight
in
but
i
vow
and
declare
that
jeremy
and
i
both
did
our
best
for
yussuf
dakmar
that
a
remarkable
thing
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
as
a
dirty
murderer
thief
liar
traitor
spy
he
had
much
claim
on
our
affections
and
jeremy
cherished
a
against
him
on
top
of
it
all
what
is
it
that
makes
us
side
with
the
bottom
dog
regardless
of
pros
and
cons
it
was
a
nasty
because
they
used
knives
and
we
relied
on
hands
and
fists
i
used
a
on
occasion
and
a
gun
when
i
had
to
but
speaking
generally
it
seems
to
me
to
demean
a
white
man
to
use
weapons
in
a
row
like
that
and
i
find
that
most
fellows
who
have
walked
the
earth
much
agree
with
me
we
tried
to
go
in
like
a
typhoon
style
but
it
did
work
another
man
let
go
of
yussuf
dakmar
who
was
growing
weak
and
too
short
of
wind
to
yell
and
in
a
moment
there
were
five
of
us
struggling
on
the
floor
between
the
seats
one
man
under
me
with
my
forearm
across
his
throat
and
another
alongside
me
stabbing
savagely
at
a
leather
valise
under
the
impression
that
he
was
carving
up
my
ribs
on
top
of
that
mess
narayan
singh
pounced
like
a
tiger
wrenching
at
arms
and
legs
until
i
struggled
to
my
feet
again
only
to
be
thrust
aside
by
jeremy
as
he
rose
and
rushed
at
yussuf
dakmar
two
assailants
but
with
all
his
speed
jeremy
was
a
tenth
of
a
tick
too
late
the
wretch
was
already
helpless
and
i
dare
say
they
broke
his
back
as
they
leaned
their
combined
weight
on
him
and
forced
him
backward
and
through
the
window
jeremy
made
a
grab
for
his
foot
but
missed
it
and
a
already
wet
with
yussuf
dakmar
blood
whipped
out
and
stung
him
in
the
thigh
that
of
course
was
sheer
ignorance
you
should
never
sting
an
australian
kill
him
or
let
him
alone
better
yet
make
friends
with
him
or
surrender
but
above
all
do
nothing
by
halves
they
a
race
of
equally
ready
to
force
their
only
shirt
on
you
or
fight
you
to
a
finish
so
jeremy
finished
the
business
at
the
window
he
took
a
neck
in
each
hand
and
cracked
their
skulls
together
until
the
of
it
was
like
the
exhaust
of
a
ford
with
loose
piston
rings
and
when
they
fell
from
his
grip
unconscious
he
came
to
my
rescue
believe
me
i
needed
it
they
were
as
strong
and
lithe
as
wildcats
those
syrians
and
fully
awake
to
the
advantage
that
the
narrow
door
gave
them
one
man
struggled
with
narayan
singh
and
kept
him
busy
with
his
bulk
so
wedged
across
the
opening
that
grim
and
hadad
were
as
good
as
demobilized
out
in
the
corridor
and
the
other
two
tackled
me
like
a
pair
of
butchers
hacking
at
a
maddened
bull
i
landed
with
my
fists
but
each
time
at
the
cost
of
a
and
though
i
got
one
by
the
wrist
and
hung
on
wrenching
and
screwing
to
throw
the
fellow
off
his
feet
the
other
man
right
was
free
and
the
erzeram
dagger
that
he
held
danced
this
and
that
way
for
an
opening
underneath
my
guard
jeremy
left
fist
landed
under
the
peak
of
his
jaw
exactly
at
the
moment
when
he
stiffened
to
launch
his
thrust
he
fell
as
if
and
the
blade
missed
my
stomach
by
six
inches
but
the
combined
force
of
thrust
and
blow
was
great
enough
to
drive
the
weapon
into
the
wooden
partition
where
it
stayed
until
i
pulled
it
out
to
keep
as
a
souvenir
there
was
much
trouble
after
that
grim
and
hadad
came
in
and
we
tore
strips
from
the
syrians
clothing
to
tie
their
hands
and
feet
with
hadad
went
to
the
rear
of
the
train
climbing
along
the
footboard
of
the
cars
to
the
caboose
to
throw
some
sort
of
bluff
to
the
conductor
who
came
forward
called
me
colonel
and
hadad
excellency
looked
our
prisoners
over
recognized
no
friends
and
said
that
everything
was
quite
all
right
he
said
he
knew
exactly
what
to
do
but
we
left
narayan
singh
on
watch
lest
that
knowledge
should
prove
too
original
which
however
it
turned
out
not
to
be
it
was
bromidian
as
old
as
history
narayan
singh
came
back
and
told
us
lo
sahib
he
went
through
their
clothes
as
an
ape
for
fleas
i
watching
and
when
he
had
all
their
valuables
he
laid
them
on
the
footboard
and
then
as
we
passed
some
bedouin
tents
he
kicked
them
off
but
he
seems
an
honest
fellow
for
he
gave
them
back
some
small
change
to
buy
food
with
should
any
be
obtainable
after
that
he
stood
flashing
his
white
teeth
for
half
an
hour
watching
mabel
bandage
jeremy
and
me
for
it
always
amuses
a
sikh
to
watch
a
white
man
eat
punishment
sikhs
are
a
fine
race
but
curious
distinctly
curious
and
given
to
unusual
amusement
when
mabel
had
finished
with
me
at
last
i
stuck
a
needle
into
him
and
he
laughed
accepting
the
stab
as
a
compliment
a
strange
thing
is
how
men
settle
down
after
excitement
birds
do
the
same
thing
a
hawk
swoops
down
on
a
hedgerow
there
is
a
great
flutter
followed
by
sudden
silence
a
minute
later
the
chattering
begins
again
without
any
reference
to
one
of
their
number
being
torn
in
the
plunderer
beak
and
so
we
even
grim
loosened
up
and
gossiped
about
feisul
and
the
already
ancient
days
when
feisul
was
the
saladin
leading
arab
hosts
to
victory
but
there
was
an
even
stranger
circumstance
than
that
we
were
the
only
people
in
the
train
our
car
for
instance
was
fairly
well
occupied
by
armenians
arabs
and
folk
whose
vague
nationality
came
under
the
general
heading
of
levantine
the
car
ahead
where
the
fight
took
place
though
not
crowded
was
vacant
and
there
were
others
in
the
car
behind
yet
not
one
of
them
made
a
move
to
interfere
they
minded
their
own
business
which
proves
i
think
that
manners
are
based
mainly
on
discretion
as
the
train
gasped
slowly
up
the
grade
and
rolled
bumpily
at
last
along
the
fertile
neglected
syrian
highland
all
the
armenians
on
the
train
removed
their
hats
and
substituted
the
red
tarboosh
preferring
the
headgear
of
a
convert
rather
than
be
the
target
of
every
bedouin
with
a
rifle
in
his
hand
the
whole
journey
was
a
of
things
to
wonder
at
not
least
of
them
the
confidence
with
which
the
train
proceeded
along
a
single
track
whose
condition
left
you
wondering
at
each
bump
whether
the
next
would
be
the
journey
violent
end
there
were
lamps
but
no
oil
for
light
when
evening
came
once
when
we
bumped
over
a
shaky
culvert
and
a
bushel
or
two
of
fell
from
the
rusty
tender
the
engineer
stopped
the
train
and
his
assistant
went
back
with
a
shovel
and
piece
of
sacking
to
gather
up
the
precious
stuff
there
was
nothing
but
squalid
villages
and
ruins
goats
and
an
occasional
rare
camel
to
be
seen
through
the
window
not
a
tree
anywhere
the
german
general
staff
having
attended
to
that
job
thoroughly
there
is
honey
in
the
country
and
it
plentiful
as
well
as
good
because
bees
are
not
easy
property
to
raid
and
make
away
with
but
the
milk
is
from
goats
and
as
for
overflowing
i
would
hate
to
have
to
punish
the
dugs
of
a
score
of
the
brutes
to
get
a
jugful
for
dinner
syria
wealth
is
of
the
past
and
the
future
long
before
it
grew
too
dark
to
watch
the
landscape
we
were
wholly
converted
to
grim
argument
that
syria
was
no
place
for
a
man
of
feisul
calibre
the
arab
owners
of
the
land
are
plundered
to
the
bone
the
men
with
money
are
foreigners
whose
only
care
is
for
a
government
that
will
favour
this
religion
and
that
breed
to
set
up
a
kingdom
there
would
be
like
preaching
a
new
religion
in
hester
street
you
could
hand
out
text
soup
and
blankets
but
you
need
a
supply
of
faith
to
carry
on
and
the
offertories
would
begin
to
meet
expenses
until
that
journey
finally
convinced
me
i
had
been
wondering
all
the
while
in
the
back
of
my
head
whether
grim
was
intending
an
impertinence
it
has
been
my
province
hitherto
to
give
advice
to
kings
for
one
thing
they
have
asked
me
for
it
if
i
were
asked
i
think
i
take
the
problem
pretty
seriously
and
hesitate
before
suggesting
to
a
man
on
whom
the
hope
of
fifty
million
people
rests
that
he
better
pull
up
stakes
and
eat
crow
in
exile
for
the
present
naturally
hate
to
be
a
king
but
if
i
were
one
i
do
think
quitting
would
look
good
and
i
think
i
feel
like
kicking
the
fellow
who
suggested
it
but
the
view
from
the
train
and
grim
talk
with
hadad
put
me
in
a
mood
in
which
syria
did
seem
good
enough
for
a
politician
let
alone
a
man
of
feisul
fame
and
character
and
when
at
last
a
few
lights
in
a
cluster
down
the
track
proclaimed
that
we
were
drawing
near
damascus
i
was
ready
to
advise
everybody
feisul
included
to
get
out
in
a
hurry
while
a
chance
remained
chapter
viii
bismillah
what
a
mercy
that
i
met
you
while
the
fireman
scraped
the
iron
floor
for
his
last
two
shovelfuls
of
and
the
train
wheezed
wearily
into
the
dark
station
grim
began
to
busy
himself
in
mysterious
ways
part
of
his
own
costume
consisted
of
a
short
curved
scimitar
attached
to
an
embroidered
belt
the
sort
of
thing
that
arabs
wear
for
ornament
rather
than
use
he
took
it
off
and
groping
in
the
dark
helped
mabel
put
it
on
without
a
word
of
explanation
then
instead
of
putting
on
his
own
moslem
he
threw
that
over
her
shoulders
and
digging
down
into
his
bag
for
a
spare
snatched
her
hat
off
and
bound
on
the
white
kerchief
in
its
place
with
the
usual
double
cord
of
then
came
my
friend
the
train
conductor
and
addressed
me
as
colonel
offering
to
carry
out
the
bags
the
moment
he
had
grabbed
his
load
and
gone
grim
broke
silence
call
her
colonel
and
me
grim
do
forget
how
we
became
aware
of
faces
under
helmets
peering
through
the
officers
of
feisul
army
on
the
watch
for
unwelcome
visitors
from
behind
them
came
the
conductor
voice
again
airing
his
english
any
more
bags
inside
there
colonel
get
out
quick
jeremy
and
make
a
fuss
about
the
colonel
coming
ordered
grim
jeremy
suddenly
became
the
servitor
establishing
importance
for
his
chief
and
never
a
newly
made
millionaire
or
modern
demagog
had
such
skillful
advertisement
the
shereefian
officers
stood
back
at
a
respectful
distance
ready
to
salute
when
the
personage
should
deign
to
alight
what
shall
be
done
with
the
memsahib
hat
demanded
narayan
singh
you
could
only
see
the
whites
of
his
eyes
but
he
shook
something
in
his
right
hand
eat
it
grim
answered
heavens
that
my
best
hat
objected
mabel
give
it
here
carry
it
under
the
cloak
get
rid
of
it
grim
ordered
and
narayan
singh
strode
off
to
contribute
yellow
leghorn
straw
and
poppies
to
the
engine
furnace
i
gave
him
ten
piastres
to
fee
the
engineer
and
five
for
the
fireman
so
you
might
say
that
was
fuel
what
kind
of
bunk
are
you
throwing
this
time
i
asked
grim
he
did
answer
but
gave
orders
to
mabel
in
short
crisp
syllables
you
colonel
lawrence
answer
no
questions
if
anyone
salutes
just
move
your
hand
and
bow
your
head
a
bit
you
just
his
height
look
straight
in
front
of
you
and
take
long
strides
bend
your
head
forward
a
little
there
that
it
i
scared
announced
mabel
by
way
of
asking
for
more
particulars
she
was
scared
in
the
least
piffle
grim
answered
remember
you
lawrence
that
all
give
you
damascus
if
you
asked
for
it
follow
jeremy
and
leave
the
rest
to
us
i
do
doubt
that
grim
had
been
turning
over
the
whole
plan
in
his
mind
for
hours
past
but
when
i
taxed
him
with
it
afterward
his
reply
was
characteristic
if
we
rehearsed
it
mabel
and
hadad
would
both
have
been
the
game
is
to
study
your
man
or
woman
as
the
case
may
be
and
sometimes
drill
sometimes
spring
it
on
according
to
circumstances
the
only
rule
is
to
study
people
there
are
no
two
quite
alike
hadad
was
surprised
into
silence
too
thoughtful
a
man
to
do
anything
except
hold
his
tongue
until
the
next
move
should
throw
more
light
on
the
situation
he
followed
us
out
of
the
car
saying
nothing
and
being
recognized
by
the
light
of
one
dim
lantern
as
an
intimate
friend
of
feisul
he
accomplished
all
that
grim
could
have
asked
of
him
he
was
known
to
have
been
in
europe
until
recently
rumours
about
lawrence
had
been
tossed
from
mouth
to
mouth
for
days
past
and
here
was
somebody
who
looked
like
lawrence
in
the
dark
followed
by
grim
and
hadad
and
addressed
as
colonel
why
should
those
three
shereefian
officers
jump
to
conclusions
salute
like
automatons
and
grin
like
loyal
men
who
have
surprised
a
secret
and
wo
tell
anyone
but
their
bosom
friends
it
was
all
over
damascus
within
the
hour
that
lawrence
had
come
from
england
to
stand
by
feisul
in
the
last
ditch
the
secret
was
kept
perfectly
we
let
mabel
walk
ahead
of
us
and
there
was
no
trouble
at
the
customs
barrier
where
normally
every
piastre
that
could
be
wrung
from
protesting
passengers
were
mulcted
to
support
a
starving
treasury
for
the
officers
strode
behind
us
and
trade
signs
to
the
customs
clerk
who
immediately
swore
at
everyone
in
sight
and
sent
all
his
minions
to
yell
for
the
best
cabs
in
damascus
narayan
singh
distributed
largesse
to
about
a
hundred
touts
and
and
we
splashed
off
toward
the
hotel
in
two
open
landaus
through
streets
six
inches
deep
in
water
except
at
the
where
the
horses
jumped
for
fear
of
losing
soundings
abana
and
pharpar
rivers
of
damascus
were
in
flood
as
usual
at
that
time
of
year
and
the
scavenging
street
curs
had
to
swim
from
one
garbage
heap
to
the
next
there
was
a
gorgeous
battle
going
on
opposite
the
hotel
door
where
half
a
dozen
mongrels
with
their
backs
to
a
heap
of
kitchen
leavings
held
a
ford
against
a
dozen
others
each
beast
that
made
good
his
passage
joining
with
the
defenders
to
fight
off
the
rest
i
stood
on
the
hotel
steps
and
watched
the
war
for
several
minutes
while
grim
went
in
with
the
others
and
registered
as
rupert
ramsden
of
chicago
and
party
the
flood
and
darkness
owing
to
the
lack
of
fuel
were
all
in
our
favour
for
such
folk
as
were
abroad
were
hardly
of
the
sort
whose
gossip
would
carry
weight
nevertheless
we
had
been
in
the
hotel
twenty
minutes
before
an
agent
of
the
bank
put
in
his
appearance
speaking
french
volubly
seeing
my
name
on
the
register
he
made
the
mistake
of
confining
his
attention
to
me
which
enabled
grim
to
get
mabel
safely
away
into
a
big
room
on
the
second
floor
the
frenchman
if
he
was
one
he
had
a
hebrew
nose
made
bold
to
corner
me
on
a
seat
near
the
door
he
was
nervous
rather
than
affable
a
little
pompous
as
behooved
the
representative
of
money
power
and
evidently
used
to
having
his
impertinences
answered
humbly
you
are
from
the
south
did
you
have
a
good
journey
was
the
train
attacked
did
you
hear
any
interesting
rumors
on
the
way
those
were
all
preliminary
questions
thrown
out
at
random
to
break
ice
as
he
sat
down
beside
me
you
could
feel
the
next
one
coming
just
as
easily
as
see
that
he
was
interested
in
the
answers
to
the
first
you
are
here
on
business
what
business
private
business
said
i
with
an
eye
on
jeremy
just
coming
down
the
stairs
you
talk
arabic
he
nodded
eyeing
me
keenly
that
man
is
my
servant
and
knows
my
affairs
i
too
tired
to
talk
after
the
journey
suppose
you
ask
him
so
jeremy
came
and
sat
beside
us
and
threw
the
cow
husband
around
as
blithely
as
he
juggles
billiard
balls
i
was
supposed
to
understand
what
he
was
saying
the
big
effendi
is
a
prizefighter
who
has
heard
there
is
money
to
be
made
at
feisul
court
at
least
that
is
what
he
says
between
you
and
me
i
think
he
is
a
spy
for
the
french
government
because
when
he
engaged
me
in
jerusalem
he
gave
me
a
of
paper
francs
with
which
to
send
a
telegram
to
paris
what
was
in
the
telegram
i
know
it
was
a
mass
of
figures
and
i
mixed
them
up
on
purpose
being
an
honest
fellow
averse
to
spy
work
oh
i
kept
an
eye
on
him
believe
me
ever
since
he
killed
a
syrian
in
the
train
i
had
my
doubts
of
him
mashallah
what
a
murderous
disposition
the
fellow
has
kill
a
man
as
soon
as
look
at
him
indeed
he
would
are
you
a
prince
in
these
parts
a
banker
bismillah
what
a
mercy
that
i
met
you
i
overheard
him
say
that
he
will
visit
the
bank
tomorrow
morning
to
cash
a
draft
for
fifty
thousand
francs
i
examine
the
draft
carefully
if
i
were
you
it
surprise
me
to
learn
it
was
stolen
or
forged
is
there
any
other
bank
that
he
could
go
to
no
only
mine
the
others
have
suspended
business
on
account
of
the
crisis
then
in
the
name
of
allah
do
forget
me
you
ought
to
give
me
a
thousand
francs
for
the
information
i
am
a
poor
man
but
honest
at
what
time
shall
i
come
for
the
money
in
the
morning
perhaps
you
could
give
me
a
little
on
account
at
once
for
my
wages
are
due
tonight
and
i
not
at
all
certain
of
getting
them
well
see
me
in
the
morning
said
the
banker
he
got
up
and
left
us
at
once
hardly
troubling
to
excuse
himself
and
grim
heard
him
tell
the
hotel
proprietor
that
our
whole
party
would
be
locked
up
in
jail
before
midnight
that
rumour
went
the
rounds
like
so
that
we
were
given
a
wide
berth
and
had
a
table
all
to
ourselves
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
big
dim
there
were
more
than
a
hundred
people
eating
dinner
and
narayan
singh
hadad
and
i
were
the
only
ones
in
western
clothes
every
seat
at
the
other
tables
was
occupied
by
some
syrian
dignitary
in
flowing
robes
rows
and
rows
of
stately
looking
notables
scant
of
speech
and
noisy
at
their
food
many
of
them
seemed
hardly
to
know
the
use
of
knife
and
fork
but
they
could
all
look
as
dignified
as
owls
even
when
crowding
in
spaghetti
with
their
fingers
we
provided
them
with
a
sensation
before
the
second
course
was
finished
a
syrian
officer
in
khaki
with
the
usual
cloth
flap
behind
his
helmet
that
forms
a
compromise
between
western
smartness
and
eastern
comfort
strode
into
the
room
and
bore
down
on
us
he
invited
us
out
into
the
corridor
with
an
air
that
suggested
we
would
better
not
refuse
and
we
filed
out
after
him
in
an
atmosphere
of
frigid
disapproval
mabel
was
honestly
scared
half
out
of
her
wits
now
not
even
the
smiles
of
the
hotel
proprietor
in
the
doorway
reassured
her
nor
his
deep
bow
as
she
passed
she
was
even
more
scared
if
that
were
possible
when
two
officers
obviously
of
high
rank
came
forward
in
the
hall
to
greet
her
and
one
addressed
her
in
arabic
as
colonel
lawrence
luckily
one
oil
lamp
per
wall
was
doing
duty
in
place
of
electric
light
or
there
might
have
been
an
awkward
incident
she
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
disguise
her
alarm
by
a
fit
of
coughing
bending
nearly
double
and
covering
the
lower
part
of
her
face
with
the
ends
of
the
headdress
folded
over
the
officers
had
no
time
to
waste
and
gave
their
message
to
grim
instead
the
emir
feisul
is
astonished
jimgrim
that
colonel
lawrence
and
you
should
visit
damascus
without
claiming
his
hospitality
we
have
two
autos
waiting
to
take
you
to
the
palace
well
the
luggage
did
amount
to
much
narayan
singh
brought
that
down
in
a
jiffy
and
when
i
went
to
settle
with
the
one
of
the
syrian
officers
interfered
these
are
guests
of
the
emir
feisul
he
announced
send
the
bill
to
me
we
were
piled
into
the
waiting
autos
mabel
grim
and
i
rode
in
the
first
one
with
the
syrian
officers
up
beside
the
driver
jeremy
narayan
singh
and
hadad
followed
and
we
went
through
the
dark
streets
like
splashing
over
shoals
unseen
i
think
certainly
unrecognized
the
streets
were
almost
deserted
and
i
did
catch
sight
of
one
armed
man
which
was
a
thing
to
marvel
at
when
you
consider
that
fifty
thousand
or
so
were
supposed
to
be
concentrated
in
the
neighbourhood
with
conscription
working
and
the
foreign
consuls
solely
occupied
in
procuring
exemption
for
their
nationals
it
was
my
first
visit
to
a
reigning
prince
for
if
you
travel
much
in
india
you
bound
to
come
in
contact
with
numbers
of
them
so
i
naturally
formed
a
mental
picture
of
what
was
in
store
for
us
made
up
from
a
mixture
of
memories
of
gwalior
baroda
bikanir
hyderabad
poona
and
baghdad
of
the
it
just
as
naturally
vanished
in
presence
of
the
quiet
dignity
of
the
real
thing
the
palace
turned
out
to
be
a
villa
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
no
bigger
and
hardly
more
pretentious
than
a
commuter
place
at
bronxville
or
mount
vernon
there
was
a
short
drive
in
front
with
one
sentry
and
one
small
lantern
burning
at
each
gate
but
their
khaki
uniforms
and
puttees
did
disguise
the
fact
that
the
sentries
were
dark
arabs
from
the
desert
country
and
though
they
presented
arms
they
did
it
as
men
who
make
concessions
without
pretending
to
admire
such
foolishness
i
would
have
given
ten
cents
for
an
unescorted
stranger
chance
of
getting
by
them
whatever
his
nationality
surely
there
was
never
less
formality
in
a
king
house
since
the
world
began
we
were
ushered
straight
into
a
narrow
rather
ordinary
hall
and
through
that
into
a
about
twenty
feet
square
the
light
was
from
oil
lamps
hanging
by
brass
chains
from
the
curved
beams
but
the
only
other
oriental
suggestions
were
the
cushioned
seats
in
each
corner
small
octagonal
tables
inlaid
with
and
a
mighty
good
persian
carpet
narayan
singh
and
jeremy
supposedly
being
servants
offered
to
stay
in
the
hall
but
were
told
that
feisul
would
approve
of
that
whatever
they
should
hear
can
be
said
in
another
room
was
the
explanation
so
we
all
sat
down
together
on
one
of
the
corner
seats
and
were
kept
waiting
about
sixty
seconds
until
feisul
entered
by
a
door
in
the
far
corner
and
when
he
came
he
took
your
breath
away
it
always
prejudices
me
against
a
man
to
be
told
that
he
is
dignified
and
stately
those
adjectives
smack
of
too
much
and
of
a
claim
to
be
made
of
different
clay
from
most
of
us
he
was
both
yet
he
was
either
and
he
did
look
like
a
priest
although
if
ever
integrity
and
righteousness
shone
from
a
man
with
their
effect
heightened
by
the
severely
simple
arab
robes
i
swear
that
man
was
he
just
about
jeremy
height
and
build
rather
tall
and
thin
that
is
with
a
slight
stoop
forward
from
the
shoulders
due
to
thoughtfulness
and
and
a
genuine
intention
not
to
hold
his
head
too
high
he
looked
like
a
shepherd
in
a
bible
picture
only
with
good
humour
added
that
brought
him
forward
out
of
a
world
of
dreams
on
to
the
same
plane
with
you
face
to
face
understanding
meeting
understanding
man
to
man
i
wish
i
could
describe
his
smile
as
he
entered
believing
he
was
coming
to
meet
lawrence
but
it
ca
be
done
maybe
you
can
imagine
it
if
you
bear
in
mind
that
this
man
was
captain
of
a
cause
as
good
as
lost
hedged
about
by
treason
and
well
aware
of
it
and
that
colonel
lawrence
was
the
one
man
in
the
world
who
had
proved
himself
capable
of
bridging
the
division
between
east
and
west
and
making
possible
the
arab
dream
of
independence
but
unhappily
it
easier
to
record
unpleasant
things
he
knew
at
the
first
glance
even
before
she
drew
back
the
kuffiyi
that
mabel
lawrence
and
i
never
seen
a
man
more
disappointed
in
all
my
wanderings
the
smile
did
vanish
he
had
too
much
pluck
and
for
that
but
you
might
say
that
iron
entered
into
it
as
if
for
a
second
he
was
mocking
destiny
willing
to
face
all
odds
alone
since
he
could
have
his
friend
and
he
threw
off
disappointment
like
a
man
dismissed
it
as
a
rock
sheds
water
coming
forward
briskly
to
shake
hands
with
grim
and
bowing
as
grim
introduced
us
at
least
here
are
two
good
friends
he
said
in
arabic
sitting
down
between
grim
and
hadad
tell
me
what
this
means
and
why
you
deceived
us
about
lawrence
we
something
to
show
you
grim
answered
ticknor
brought
it
otherwise
it
might
have
been
seen
by
the
wrong
people
feisul
took
the
hint
and
dismissed
the
syrian
officers
calling
them
by
their
first
names
as
he
gave
them
leave
to
go
then
mabel
produced
the
letter
and
feisul
read
it
crossing
one
thin
leg
over
the
other
and
leaning
back
easily
but
he
sat
forward
again
and
laughed
bitterly
when
he
had
read
it
twice
over
i
did
write
this
i
never
saw
it
before
or
heard
of
it
he
said
simply
i
know
that
said
grim
but
we
thought
you
better
look
at
it
feisul
laid
the
letter
across
his
knee
and
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
i
thought
he
was
going
to
do
what
nine
men
out
of
ten
in
a
tight
place
would
certainly
have
done
but
he
blew
out
the
match
and
went
on
smoking
you
mean
your
government
has
seen
the
thing
and
sent
you
to
confront
me
with
it
it
was
grim
turn
to
laugh
and
he
was
jubilant
without
a
trace
of
bitterness
no
the
chief
and
i
have
risked
our
jobs
by
not
reporting
it
this
visit
is
strictly
unofficial
feisul
handed
the
letter
back
to
him
and
it
was
grim
who
struck
a
match
and
burned
it
after
tearing
off
the
seal
for
a
memento
you
know
what
it
means
of
course
grim
trod
the
ash
into
the
carpet
if
the
french
could
have
come
by
that
letter
in
jerusalem
they
have
dreyfussed
you
put
you
on
trial
for
your
life
on
evidence
they
send
a
sworn
copy
of
it
to
the
british
to
keep
them
from
taking
your
part
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
burning
it
feisul
answered
he
did
look
helpless
hopeless
or
bewildered
but
dumb
and
clinging
on
like
a
man
who
holds
an
insecure
footing
against
a
hurricane
it
means
that
the
men
all
about
you
are
traitors
grim
went
on
not
all
of
them
feisul
interrupted
but
many
of
them
answered
grim
your
arabs
are
loyal
some
of
your
syrians
are
dogs
whom
anyone
can
hire
it
was
straight
speaking
from
a
major
in
foreign
service
uninvited
to
a
king
it
sounded
near
the
knuckle
feisul
took
it
quite
pleasantly
i
know
one
from
the
other
jimgrim
grim
got
up
and
took
a
chair
opposite
feisul
he
was
all
worked
up
and
sweating
at
hotter
under
the
collar
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
it
means
he
went
on
with
a
hand
on
each
knee
and
his
strange
eyes
fixed
steadily
on
feisul
that
the
french
are
ready
to
attack
you
it
means
they
sure
of
capturing
your
person
and
bent
on
seeing
your
finish
they
give
you
a
drumhead
court
martial
and
make
excuses
afterward
inshallah
feisul
answered
meaning
if
allah
permits
it
that
is
exactly
the
right
word
grim
exploded
and
lord
he
was
hard
put
to
it
to
keep
excitement
within
bounds
i
could
see
his
neck
trembling
and
there
were
little
beads
of
sweat
on
his
temple
it
was
grim
at
last
without
the
mask
on
allah
marks
the
destiny
of
all
of
us
do
you
suppose
we
here
for
nothing
at
this
time
feisul
smiled
i
am
glad
to
see
you
he
said
simply
are
you
planning
to
fight
the
french
grim
asked
him
suddenly
in
the
sort
of
way
that
a
man
at
close
quarters
lets
rip
an
i
must
fight
or
yield
they
have
sent
an
ultimatum
but
delayed
it
so
as
not
to
permit
me
time
to
answer
it
has
expired
already
they
are
probably
advancing
and
you
intend
to
sit
here
and
wait
for
them
i
shall
be
at
the
front
you
know
you
have
a
chance
my
advisers
think
that
my
presence
at
the
front
will
encourage
our
men
sufficiently
to
win
the
day
have
you
a
charm
against
mustard
gas
that
is
our
weakness
no
we
have
no
masks
and
the
wind
setting
up
from
the
sea
at
this
time
of
year
your
army
is
going
straight
into
a
trap
and
you
along
with
it
half
of
the
men
who
advise
you
to
go
to
the
front
will
fight
like
lions
against
a
net
and
the
other
half
will
sell
you
to
the
french
your
fifty
thousand
men
will
melt
like
butter
in
the
sun
and
your
arab
cause
will
be
left
without
a
leader
feisul
pondered
that
for
about
a
minute
leaning
back
and
watching
grim
face
we
held
a
council
of
war
jimgrim
he
said
at
last
it
was
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
staff
that
we
ought
to
fight
and
the
cabinet
upheld
them
i
could
cancel
the
order
if
i
wished
what
would
you
think
of
a
king
who
left
his
army
in
the
lurch
nobody
will
ever
accuse
you
of
cowardice
grim
answered
you
a
proven
brave
man
if
ever
there
was
one
the
point
is
do
you
want
all
your
bravery
and
hard
work
for
the
arab
cause
to
go
for
nothing
do
you
want
the
prospect
of
arab
independence
to
go
up
in
smoke
on
a
battlefield
it
would
break
my
heart
said
feisul
although
one
heart
hardly
matters
it
would
break
more
hearts
than
yours
grim
retorted
there
are
millions
looking
to
you
for
leadership
leave
me
out
of
it
leave
lawrence
out
of
it
and
all
the
other
who
have
done
their
bit
for
you
leave
most
of
these
syrians
out
of
it
for
they
simply
politicians
making
use
of
you
a
mess
of
breeds
and
creeds
so
mixed
and
corrupted
that
they
do
know
which
end
up
they
stand
if
the
syrians
had
guts
they
have
rallied
so
hard
to
you
long
ago
that
no
outsider
would
have
had
a
chance
what
do
you
mean
what
are
you
proposing
feisul
asked
quietly
baghdad
is
your
place
not
damascus
but
here
i
am
in
damascus
feisul
retorted
and
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
note
of
impatience
in
his
voice
i
came
here
at
the
request
of
the
allies
on
the
strength
of
their
promises
i
did
not
ask
to
be
king
i
would
rather
not
be
let
any
man
be
ruler
whom
the
arabs
choose
and
i
will
work
for
him
loyally
but
the
arabs
chose
me
and
the
allies
consented
it
was
only
after
they
had
won
their
war
with
our
help
that
the
french
began
raising
objections
and
the
british
deserted
me
it
is
too
late
to
talk
of
baghdad
now
it
is
it
too
soon
grim
answered
bringing
down
a
clenched
fist
on
his
knee
and
feisul
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
you
talk
like
a
prophet
jimgrim
but
let
me
tell
you
something
it
is
mainly
a
question
of
money
after
all
the
british
paid
us
a
subsidy
until
they
withdrew
from
syria
they
did
their
best
for
us
even
then
for
they
left
behind
guns
ammunition
wagons
and
supplies
when
the
french
seized
the
ports
they
promised
to
continue
the
subsidy
because
they
are
collecting
the
customs
dues
and
we
have
no
other
revenue
worth
mentioning
but
rather
than
send
us
money
the
french
have
told
our
people
not
to
pay
taxes
so
our
treasury
is
empty
nevertheless
we
contrived
by
one
means
and
another
we
arranged
a
bank
credit
and
ordered
supplies
from
abroad
the
supplies
have
reached
beirut
but
the
french
have
ordered
the
bank
to
cancel
the
credit
and
until
we
pay
for
the
supplies
they
are
withheld
any
gas
masks
among
the
supplies
you
ordered
grim
asked
him
and
feisul
nodded
that
banker
has
played
fast
and
loose
with
us
until
the
last
minute
relying
on
our
undertaking
not
to
molest
foreigners
he
has
resided
in
damascus
making
promises
one
day
and
breaking
them
the
next
keeping
his
funds
in
beirut
and
his
agency
here
draining
money
out
of
the
country
all
the
while
why
did
you
arrest
him
we
gave
our
word
to
the
french
that
he
should
have
complete
protection
and
immunity
it
seemed
a
good
thing
to
us
to
have
such
an
influential
banker
here
he
has
international
connections
as
recently
as
yesterday
twenty
minutes
before
that
ultimatum
came
he
was
in
this
room
assuring
me
that
he
would
be
able
to
solve
the
credit
difficulty
within
a
day
or
two
would
you
like
to
send
for
him
now
suggested
grim
i
doubt
if
he
would
come
well
have
him
fetched
feisul
shook
his
head
if
other
people
break
their
promises
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
break
ours
if
we
can
defeat
the
french
and
force
them
to
make
other
terms
then
we
will
expel
him
from
syria
i
leave
at
midnight
jimgrim
to
defeat
the
french
you
go
to
your
waterloo
you
in
check
with
only
one
move
possible
and
i
here
to
make
you
realize
it
you
a
man
after
my
own
heart
feisul
but
you
and
your
arabs
are
children
at
dealing
with
these
foreign
exploiters
they
can
beat
you
at
every
game
but
honesty
and
listen
if
you
did
defeat
the
french
if
you
drove
them
into
the
sea
tomorrow
they
get
away
with
all
the
money
in
beirut
and
you
still
be
at
the
mercy
of
foreign
capitalists
instead
of
an
independent
arab
kingdom
here
have
a
mixture
of
peoples
and
religions
all
plotting
against
one
another
and
you
with
capitulations
and
foreign
consuls
getting
in
the
way
and
bankers
sitting
on
top
of
it
all
like
the
old
man
of
the
sea
in
the
story
of
sindbad
the
sailor
leave
that
to
the
french
let
them
have
all
syria
to
stew
in
go
to
england
where
your
friends
are
let
the
politicians
alone
meet
real
folk
and
talk
with
them
tell
them
the
truth
for
they
do
know
it
talk
with
the
men
and
women
who
have
got
political
jobs
to
lose
with
the
fellows
who
did
the
fighting
with
the
men
and
women
who
have
votes
they
believe
you
they
given
up
believing
politicians
and
learning
how
to
twist
the
politicians
tails
you
find
yourself
in
baghdad
within
a
year
or
two
with
all
mesopotamia
to
make
a
garden
of
and
none
but
arabs
to
deal
with
that
your
field
feisul
smiled
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
recognizes
but
is
unconvinced
there
are
always
things
that
might
have
been
he
answered
as
it
is
i
can
not
desert
the
army
we
save
what
we
can
of
the
army
grim
answered
your
syrians
will
save
their
own
skins
it
only
the
arabs
we
got
to
look
out
for
a
line
of
retreat
for
the
arab
regiments
and
another
for
you
it
not
too
late
and
you
know
i
right
come
on
let
get
busy
and
do
it
feisul
smile
was
all
affection
and
approval
but
he
shook
his
head
if
what
you
say
is
true
i
should
only
have
the
same
problem
in
mesopotamia
foreign
financiers
he
answered
that
exactly
where
you
wrong
grim
retorted
triumphantly
he
stood
up
and
pointed
at
jeremy
here
a
man
who
owns
a
it
lies
between
mesopotamia
and
your
father
kingdom
of
the
hedjaz
and
its
exact
whereabouts
is
a
secret
he
here
tonight
to
make
you
a
present
of
the
mine
and
here
another
man
he
pointed
at
me
a
mining
expert
who
tell
you
what
the
thing
worth
it
yours
if
you
agree
to
abandon
syria
and
lay
a
course
for
baghdad
chapter
xiv
you
be
a
virgin
victim
feisul
was
interested
he
could
help
being
and
he
was
utterly
convinced
of
grim
sincerity
but
he
was
moved
from
his
purpose
and
not
even
jeremy
account
of
the
or
my
professional
opinion
of
its
value
had
the
least
effect
toward
cancelling
the
plans
he
had
in
mind
he
was
deeply
affected
by
the
offer
but
that
was
all
good
heavens
man
grim
exploded
suddenly
surely
you
wo
throw
the
whole
world
into
war
again
you
know
what
it
will
mean
if
the
french
kill
or
imprison
you
there
is
a
moslem
of
all
the
millions
in
asia
who
wo
swear
vengeance
against
the
west
you
know
that
a
direct
descendant
of
mohammed
and
the
first
outstanding
conquering
moslem
since
saladin
the
allies
should
have
thought
of
that
before
they
broke
promises
said
feisul
never
mind
them
damn
them
answered
grim
it
up
to
you
the
future
of
civilization
is
in
your
lap
this
minute
ca
you
see
that
if
you
lose
you
be
a
martyr
and
islam
will
rise
to
avenge
you
inshallah
said
feisul
nodding
but
that
if
you
let
pride
go
by
the
board
and
seem
to
run
away
there
be
a
breathing
spell
asia
would
wonder
for
a
few
months
and
do
nothing
until
it
began
to
dawn
on
them
that
you
had
acted
wisely
and
had
a
better
plan
in
view
i
am
not
proud
except
of
my
nation
feisul
answered
i
would
not
let
pride
interfere
with
policy
but
it
is
too
late
to
talk
of
this
which
is
better
grin
demanded
a
martyr
the
very
mention
of
whose
name
means
war
or
a
living
power
for
peace
under
a
temporary
cloud
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
poor
host
forgive
me
feisul
answered
dinner
has
been
waiting
all
this
while
and
you
have
a
lady
with
you
this
is
disgraceful
he
rose
and
led
the
way
into
another
room
closing
the
discussion
we
ate
an
ordinary
meal
in
an
ordinary
dining
room
feisul
presiding
and
talking
trivialities
with
mabel
and
hadad
there
was
an
occasional
boisterous
interlude
by
jeremy
but
even
he
with
his
tales
of
unknown
arabia
could
lift
the
load
of
depression
grim
and
i
sat
silent
through
the
meal
i
experienced
the
sensation
that
you
get
when
an
expedition
proves
a
failure
and
you
got
to
go
home
again
with
nothing
done
all
dreary
emptiness
but
grim
was
hatching
something
as
you
could
tell
by
the
expression
and
the
glowering
light
in
his
eyes
he
looked
about
ready
for
murder
narayan
singh
face
all
through
the
meal
was
a
picture
delight
and
pride
at
dining
with
a
king
amazement
at
his
karma
that
had
brought
a
sepoy
of
the
line
to
hear
such
confidences
first
hand
chagrin
over
grim
apparent
failure
and
desire
to
be
inconspicuous
controlled
his
expression
in
turn
once
or
twice
he
tried
to
make
conversation
with
me
but
i
was
in
no
mood
for
it
being
a
grouchy
old
bear
on
occasion
without
decent
manners
feisul
excused
himself
the
minute
the
meal
was
over
saying
he
had
a
conference
to
attend
and
we
all
went
back
into
the
where
grim
took
the
chair
he
occupied
before
and
marshalled
us
into
a
row
on
the
seat
in
front
of
him
he
was
back
again
in
form
electric
and
have
you
folk
got
the
hang
of
this
he
asked
do
you
realize
what
it
means
if
feisul
goes
out
and
gets
scuppered
we
thought
we
did
even
if
we
did
i
do
suppose
anyone
except
the
few
who
like
grim
have
made
a
of
the
problem
of
islam
in
all
its
bearings
could
quite
have
grasped
it
mabel
had
a
viewpoint
that
served
grim
purpose
as
well
as
any
at
the
moment
that
man
too
good
and
much
too
to
be
wasted
she
said
emphatically
suppose
that
if
colonel
lawrence
were
really
here
half
a
minute
said
grim
and
i
come
to
that
how
about
you
hadad
how
far
would
you
go
to
save
feisul
from
this
waterloo
i
would
go
a
long
way
he
answered
cautiously
what
do
you
intend
to
appear
near
the
for
one
thing
with
somebody
who
looks
like
colonel
lawrence
and
somebody
else
who
looks
enough
like
feisul
in
one
of
feisul
cars
and
give
the
french
a
run
for
it
in
one
direction
while
feisul
escapes
in
the
other
wallahi
but
what
if
feisul
wo
go
he
get
helped
did
you
ever
hear
what
they
did
to
napoleon
at
waterloo
seized
his
bridle
and
galloped
away
with
him
you
mean
i
to
act
lawrence
again
asked
mabel
looking
deathly
white
grim
nodded
who
cast
for
feisul
jeremy
inquired
you
are
you
the
only
trained
in
the
bunch
you
his
height
not
unlike
his
figure
i
resemble
him
as
much
as
a
kangaroo
looks
like
an
ostrich
laughed
jeremy
you
talking
wild
jim
what
have
you
had
to
drink
how
about
you
ramsden
will
you
see
this
through
jeremy
shook
his
head
at
me
i
believe
he
thought
for
the
moment
that
grim
had
gone
mad
he
had
the
experience
of
grim
that
i
had
and
consequently
not
the
same
confidence
in
grim
ability
to
dream
catch
the
essence
of
the
dream
pin
it
down
and
make
a
fact
of
it
i
go
the
limit
said
i
well
i
be
damned
laughed
jeremy
all
right
same
here
i
stake
a
and
rammy
raises
me
fetch
your
crown
and
sceptre
and
play
king
to
jim
ace
in
a
royal
straight
flush
mabel
queen
hadad
a
knave
he
looks
it
keep
smiling
hadad
old
top
and
let
you
forgive
me
rammy
the
tentative
tenacious
ten
aces
up
his
sleeve
and
packs
a
wallop
when
you
get
him
going
what
narayan
singh
the
deuce
the
joker
answered
grim
are
you
in
on
this
sahib
there
was
no
need
to
ask
what
your
honor
finds
good
enough
your
honor
order
orders
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
we
not
in
british
territory
this
in
unofficial
i
no
right
to
give
you
orders
said
grim
you
free
to
refuse
i
likely
to
lose
my
job
over
this
and
so
are
you
if
you
take
part
in
it
narayan
singh
grinned
hugely
hah
a
sepoy
position
is
a
smaller
stake
than
a
major
commission
or
a
but
i
likewise
have
a
life
to
lose
and
i
play
too
grim
nodded
curtly
it
was
no
time
for
returning
compliments
how
about
you
mabel
we
can
manage
this
without
you
and
you
a
husband
to
think
of
if
he
were
here
he
hate
it
but
he
give
permission
all
right
now
hadad
what
about
it
am
i
to
obey
you
absolutely
not
knowing
what
the
grim
interrupted
him
the
proposal
fair
either
you
withdraw
now
and
hold
your
tongue
or
come
in
with
us
if
you
in
i
tell
the
details
if
not
there
no
need
wallahi
what
a
you
are
jimgrim
if
i
say
i
risk
my
future
on
your
backgammon
board
if
i
say
my
life
is
worth
a
millieme
for
you
will
tell
that
sikh
you
call
the
to
attend
to
me
not
so
grim
answered
if
you
do
like
the
plan
i
trust
you
to
fall
out
and
keep
the
secret
oh
in
that
case
answered
hadad
hesitating
since
you
put
it
that
way
well
it
is
lose
all
or
perhaps
win
something
are
no
good
the
alternative
is
ruin
of
the
arab
cause
it
is
a
forlorn
hope
well
one
throw
of
the
dice
eh
and
all
our
fortunes
on
the
table
one
little
mistake
and
helas
finish
never
mind
yes
i
will
play
too
i
will
play
this
to
the
end
with
you
so
we
all
set
remarked
grim
with
a
sigh
of
relief
instantly
he
threw
his
shoulders
back
and
began
to
set
his
pieces
for
the
game
and
you
know
there
a
world
of
difference
between
the
captain
of
a
side
who
does
worry
until
the
game
begins
and
grim
sort
who
do
their
worrying
beforehand
and
then
play
and
make
the
whole
side
play
for
every
ounce
that
in
them
mabel
you
lawrence
keep
silent
be
shy
avoid
encounters
act
like
a
man
who
not
supposed
to
be
here
but
who
came
to
help
feisul
contrary
to
express
commands
laid
on
him
by
the
foreign
office
get
that
lawrence
is
a
shy
man
anyway
hates
publicity
rank
anything
that
calls
attention
to
himself
the
more
shy
you
are
the
easier
you
get
away
with
it
feisul
must
help
pretend
you
lawrence
the
presence
of
lawrence
would
add
to
his
prestige
incalculably
and
i
think
he
see
that
but
if
not
never
mind
we
manage
any
questions
quick
you
ca
ask
questions
when
you
given
that
sort
of
opportunity
the
right
ones
do
occur
to
you
and
the
others
seem
absurd
grim
knew
that
of
course
but
when
you
dealing
with
a
woman
there
just
one
chance
in
a
hundred
that
she
may
think
of
something
vital
that
occurred
to
anybody
else
most
women
are
practical
but
it
the
impractical
things
that
happen
suppose
we
captured
by
the
french
she
suggested
that
going
to
happen
he
answered
when
they
got
you
then
you
mabel
ticknor
who
never
saw
lawrence
and
would
recognize
him
if
you
did
they
ask
why
i
wearing
man
clothes
and
masquerading
as
an
arab
well
you
a
woman
are
you
you
answer
with
another
question
ask
them
just
how
safe
a
woman
would
be
they
may
claim
that
their
algerians
are
but
they
ca
blame
you
for
not
believing
it
anything
else
she
shook
her
head
and
he
turned
on
hadad
hadad
lose
no
opportunity
of
whispering
that
lawrence
is
with
feisul
add
that
lawrence
does
want
his
presence
known
hunt
out
two
or
three
loyal
arabs
on
the
staff
and
tell
them
the
plan
is
to
kidnap
feisul
and
carry
him
to
safety
across
the
border
but
do
do
it
too
soon
wait
until
the
debacle
begins
and
then
persuade
a
few
of
them
old
ali
for
instance
and
osman
choose
the
old
guard
you
and
they
bolt
with
him
to
haifa
the
syrians
have
been
thoroughly
undermined
by
propaganda
gas
will
do
the
rest
and
as
soon
as
the
arabs
see
the
syrians
run
they
listen
to
reason
they
know
you
and
know
you
on
the
level
do
you
understand
will
you
do
that
i
will
try
i
see
many
a
chance
of
spilling
before
this
cup
comes
to

carry
it
carefully

tell
him
that
a

give
him
to
understand
that
no
suspicion
rests
on
him
get
him
if
you
can
to
send
a
message
to
the
french
general

warning
them
to
watch
for

adolphe
rene
everybody
knows

jeremy
look
as

those

that
shakespeare
spoke
of
are
at

disregarding
all
the

and
argument
about
human

as
opposed
to

i
say
this
without
any
care
at
all
who
contradicts
me
that
whoever
is
near
the
hub
of

is
the
agent
of

can
no
more
help
himself
than
can
the

believe
that
they

should

make

fellow
laugh
the

and
having
writ

on
the
old

omar
knew
the
truth
of
it
you
could
almost
hear
the
of
progress
click
as
the
door
opened
before
grim
had
finished
speaking
and
a
staff
officer
appeared
to
invite
him
to
be
present
at
feisul
conference
grim
asked
at
once
for
the
auto
for
me
i
could
have
had
it
otherwise
and
a
moment
later
jeremy
and
i
were
scooting
into
darkness
through
narrow
streets
and
driving
rain
with
the
hubs
of
the
wheels
awash
in
places
and
shipping
it
green
over
the
floor
when
we
dipped
and
pitched
over
a
gutter
the
arab
driver
knew
the
way
from
which
i
take
it
he
had
a
compass
in
his
head
as
well
as
a
charm
against
accidents
and
a
spirit
of
recklessness
that
put
faith
in
springs
there
was
room
for
more
than
one
set
of
wheels
at
a
time
in
most
of
the
streets
we
tore
through
but
a
camel
tried
to
share
one
fairway
with
us
and
had
the
worst
of
it
he
cannoned
off
into
an
alley
end
first
and
we
could
hear
him
bellowing
with
rage
a
block
away
and
our
manner
of
stopping
was
like
our
progress
prompt
the
bands
went
on
with
a
shriek
and
jeremy
and
i
pitched
forward
as
the
car
brought
up
against
the
kerb
in
front
of
an
enormous
door
whose
brass
knocker
shone
like
gold
in
the
rays
of
our
headlights
we
told
the
arab
to
wait
for
us
and
stepped
into
a
pool
invisible
stumbled
and
nearly
fell
over
a
great
stone
set
to
bridge
the
flood
between
street
and
door
then
proceeded
to
use
the
knocker
importunately
thunderously
angrily
as
men
with
wet
feet
and
bruised
toes
likely
will
whatever
the
custom
of
the
country
we
went
on
knocking
taking
turns
until
the
door
opened
at
last
and
the
banker
servant
peered
at
us
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
demanding
to
know
in
the
name
of
the
thousand
and
one
devils
whom
solomon
boiled
in
oil
what
impudent
scavengers
were
making
all
that
noise
but
the
banker
himself
was
in
the
background
thinking
perhaps
that
the
french
had
come
already
on
the
lookout
over
the
servant
shoulder
for
a
glimpse
of
a
kepi
so
we
put
our
shoulders
to
the
door
thrust
by
the
servant
and
walked
in
take
care
i
have
a
pistol
in
my
hand
said
the
banker
voice
three
shots
for
a
shilling
at
me
then
retorted
jeremy
who
are
you
tell
that
shivering
fool
to
bring
the
candle
and
you
see
oh
you
is
it
i
told
you
to
come
in
the
morning
i
ca
see
you
now
ca
see
me
eh
come
in
here
and
peel
your
eyes
cocky
sit
down
and
look
at
us
there
take
a
pew
wonder
where
i
learned
such
good
english
well
i
used
to
shine
the
toenails
of
the
prince
o
wales
and
you
have
to
pass
a
civil
service
examination
before
they
give
you
that
good
job
i
talk
any
language
except
french
and
jewish
but
this
master
of
mine
turns
out
to
be
a
jew
who
talks
french
and
not
a
prizefighter
after
all
what
did
i
tell
you
this
evening
said
he
was
a
spy
for
the
french
did
i
i
tell
you
i
a
dependable
man
what
i
say
you
can
bet
on
till
you
lost
all
your
money
here
he
is
spying
to
beat
the
just
had
tea
with
feisul
and
learned
all
the
inside
facts
offered
me
a
pound
to
come
and
find
you
but
i
charged
him
two
and
got
the
money
in
advance
you
ought
to
pay
me
a
commission
too
and
then
i
get
married
if
there
an
honest
woman
left
in
damascus
if
either
of
you
want
my
advice
you
wo
believe
a
word
the
other
says
but
i
expect
both
too
wilful
to
be
guided
anyhow
you
have
to
talk
in
front
of
me
because
my
master
is
afraid
of
being
murdered
he
is
afraid
of
ghosts
or
bad
smells
but
the
sight
of
a
long
knife
turns
his
heart
to
water
and
sets
him
to
praying
so
loud
that
you
ca
get
a
word
in
edgewise
go
on
both
of
you
yalla
talk
does
it
begin
to
be
obvious
why
kings
used
to
employ
court
jesters
the
modern
cabinets
should
have
them
men
like
jeremy
though
they
be
hard
to
find
to
break
the
crust
of
situations
suspicion
weakens
in
the
presence
of
incongruity
this
fellow
seems
less
than
i
said
but
he
shrewd
and
i
found
him
useful
unfortunately
he
has
picked
up
a
lot
of
information
so
we
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
my
business
is
to
communicate
with
the
french
general
staff
and
i
told
you
know
how
to
manage
it
who
told
you
that
those
who
gave
me
my
instructions
if
you
do
know
who
they
are
without
my
telling
you
you
the
wrong
man
and
i
not
waste
time
with
you
let
us
suppose
that
i
know
then
proceed
your
name
was
given
to
me
as
that
of
a
man
who
can
be
trusted
to
take
necessary
action
in
the
interests
of
er
you
understand
the
plot
for
feisul
to
be
kidnapped
by
some
syrian
members
of
his
staff
has
been
discovered
at
the
last
minute
i
said
looking
hard
at
him
and
he
winced
palpably
mon
dieu
you
mean
that
it
is
not
too
late
to
save
the
situation
you
have
not
been
accused
of
connection
with
it
i
came
here
in
pursuance
of
a
different
plan
to
kidnap
him
a
sort
of
reserve
plan
to
be
employed
in
case
other
means
should
fail
all
arrangements
are
in
working
order
except
the
one
item
of
communicating
with
the
french
general
staff
i
require
you
to
accompany
me
for
that
purpose
and
to
send
off
to
them
immediately
a
message
at
my
dictation
tschaa
suppose
you
show
me
your
authority
certainly
i
answered
realizing
that
he
was
in
immediate
danger
of
life
he
had
returned
his
own
pistol
to
his
pocket
so
i
showed
him
the
muzzle
of
mine
and
he
divined
without
a
sermon
on
the
subject
that
it
would
go
off
and
shoot
accurately
unless
he
showed
discretion
he
did
offer
to
move
when
jeremy
agile
fingers
found
his
pocket
and
flicked
out
the
thing
with
which
he
had
previously
kept
his
courage
warm
i
was
told
not
to
trust
you
too
far
i
explained
i
was
warned
in
advance
that
you
might
question
my
credentials
you
are
said
to
be
jealous
of
interference
as
a
precaution
against
miscarriage
of
this
plan
through
jealousy
on
your
part
i
was
ordered
to
oblige
you
to
obey
me
and
if
i
refuse
your
widow
will
then
be
the
individual
most
concerned
be
good
enough
to
take
pen
and
paper
and
write
a
letter
to
my
dictation
jeremy
went
to
the
door
which
was
partly
open
made
sure
that
the
servant
was
out
of
earshot
and
slammed
it
tight
rene
the
banker
went
to
his
escritoire
took
paper
and
shook
his
fountain
pen
how
shall
i
commence
the
letter
he
asked
me
with
a
dry
sly
smile
he
thought
he
had
me
there
there
are
doubtless
proper
forms
of
address
that
serve
to
establish
the
genuineness
of
letters
written
by
a
spy
commence
down
the
page
i
answered
we
insert
the
address
afterwards
write
in
french
i
shall
accompany
the
emir
feisul
and
colonel
lawrence
to
the
front
tonight
former
plan
having
miscarried
when
syrian
retreat
begins
look
out
for
automobile
containing
feisul
and
lawrence
which
may
be
recognized
easily
as
it
will
also
contain
myself
and
another
civilian
in
plain
clothes
at
the
psychological
moment
a
white
flag
will
be
shown
from
it
waved
perhaps
surreptitiously
by
one
of
the
civilians
in
the
event
of
breakdown
of
the
automobile
a
horsed
vehicle
will
be
used
and
the
same
signal
will
apply
for
the
sake
of
myself
and
the
other
civilian
please
instruct
all
officers
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
and
protect
the
party
from
being
fired
on
there
i
said
sign
that
and
address
it
he
hesitated
he
could
doubt
that
his
own
arrangements
with
traitors
on
the
staff
to
kidnap
feisul
had
gone
amiss
else
how
should
i
be
aware
of
them
at
all
i
who
had
only
arrived
that
evening
in
damascus
but
it
puzzled
him
to
know
why
i
should
make
him
write
the
letter
or
since
his
plan
must
have
failed
why
i
should
let
him
share
in
the
kidnapping
he
smelt
the
obvious
rat
why
did
i
sign
the
letter
myself
and
get
all
the
credit
afterward
as
any
other
spy
would
do
you
sign
it
he
said
pushing
the
letter
toward
me
and
i
got
one
of
those
sudden
inspirations
that
there
is
no
explaining
the
right
idea
for
handling
fox
rene
the
banker
so
you
afraid
to
sign
that
are
you
all
right
give
it
here
sign
it
pass
me
your
pen
but
you
come
along
with
me
tonight
my
lad
and
make
your
explanations
to
the
french
in
the
morning
looking
back
i
can
see
how
the
accusation
worked
although
it
was
an
arrow
shot
at
a
venture
his
greasy
sly
fox
face
with
its
touch
of
bold
impudence
betrayed
him
for
a
man
who
would
habitually
hedge
his
bets
feisul
had
protected
him
from
official
interference
but
it
had
needed
more
than
that
to
preserve
him
from
unofficial
murder
and
beyond
a
doubt
he
had
betrayed
the
french
in
minor
ways
whenever
that
course
looked
profitable
now
in
a
crisis
he
had
small
choice
but
to
establish
himself
as
loyal
to
the
stronger
side
he
hurriedly
wrote
a
number
at
the
bottom
of
the
letter
and
another
followed
by
three
capitals
and
three
more
figures
at
the
top
seal
it
up
and
send
it
quick
i
ordered
him
he
obeyed
and
jeremy
called
the
servant
summon
francois
said
the
banker
and
the
servant
disappeared
again
francois
must
remain
a
mystery
he
was
insoluble
dressed
in
a
pair
of
baggy
turkish
pants
with
a
red
sash
round
his
middle
knotted
loosely
over
a
woollen
jersey
that
had
wide
horizontal
black
and
yellow
strips
with
a
grey
woollen
shawl
over
the
lot
and
a
new
tarboosh
a
size
or
two
too
small
for
him
perched
at
an
angle
on
his
head
he
stood
shifting
from
one
bare
foot
to
the
other
and
moved
a
toothless
gap
in
his
lower
face
in
what
was
presumably
a
smile
he
had
no
nose
that
you
could
recognize
although
there
were
two
holes
in
place
of
nostrils
with
a
hideous
long
scar
above
them
one
ear
was
missing
he
had
no
eyebrows
but
the
remaining
ear
was
pointed
at
the
top
like
a
satyr
and
his
little
beady
eyes
were
as
black
as
a
bird
and
inhumanly
bright
the
banker
spoke
to
him
in
the
voice
you
would
use
to
a
rather
spoilt
child
when
obedience
was
using
arabic
with
a
few
french
words
thrown
in
ah
here
is
francois
good
francois
francois
mon
brave
here
is
a
letter
eh
you
know
where
to
take
it
eh
francois
knows
does
he
francois
does
talk
he
tells
nobody
he
wise
is
francois
he
runs
eh
he
runs
through
the
rain
and
the
night
and
he
hides
so
that
nobody
can
see
him
and
he
delivers
the
letter
and
somebody
gives
francois
money
and
tobacco
and
a
little
rum
and
francois
comes
running
back
to
the
nice
little
dark
little
hole
where
he
sleeps
plenty
to
eat
eh
francois
nice
soft
food
that
needs
no
chewing
nothing
to
do
but
run
with
a
letter
now
and
then
eh
a
brave
fellow
is
francois
a
clever
fellow
a
trustworthy
fellow
a
dependable
willing
fellow
always
ready
to
please
ready
to
go
well
there
the
letter
be
careful
with
it
and
like
a
good
boy
a
whole
bottle
of
rum
when
you
come
back
think
of
it
a
whole
bottle
of
nice
brown
rum
to
yourself
in
that
nice
little
room
where
your
bed
is
there
goodbye
the
creature
addressed
as
francois
vanished
with
a
snort
and
a
sort
of
squeal
that
may
have
been
meant
for
speech
that
is
the
best
messenger
in
syria
said
rene
he
is
priceless
incorruptible
silent
and
as
sure
as
destiny
the
french
general
staff
will
have
that
letter
before
dawn
now
what
next
you
come
with
me
i
answered
he
felt
better
now
that
the
message
was
on
its
way
second
thought
convinced
him
of
my
connection
with
the
french
there
is
no
more
profitless
delusion
than
to
suppose
that
a
country
secret
agents
are
always
its
own
nationals
they
are
almost
always
not
if
the
french
used
only
frenchmen
germany
used
none
but
germans
great
britain
only
englishmen
and
so
on
it
might
be
prettier
and
easier
for
the
police
but
intelligence
departments
would
starve
so
there
was
nothing
about
an
obvious
american
doing
for
the
french
that
should
stick
in
his
craw
and
that
being
so
the
more
cheerfully
he
aided
me
the
better
it
would
likely
be
for
him
so
he
called
for
the
servant
again
and
proved
himself
a
good
campaigner
by
superintending
the
packing
of
a
big
basket
with
provisions
bread
and
butter
cold
chicken
wine
olives
and
hot
coffee
in
a
thermos
bottle
the
french
will
be
in
damascus
by
noon
tomorrow
he
said
those
french
and
their
hungry
algerians
we
do
well
to
take
a
good
provision
with
us
enough
for
two
days
at
least
we
shall
enter
with
them
i
suppose
or
at
least
behind
them
and
of
course
my
house
here
will
receive
consideration
but
how
many
chickens
do
you
believe
will
be
purchasable
in
damascus
one
hour
after
the
first
algerians
get
here
eh
put
in
another
chicken
hassan
mon
brave
eh
bien
oui
pack
the
basket
full
put
in
more
of
everything
at
last
he
got
into
an
overcoat
lined
with
for
the
night
air
was
chilly
and
an
overcoat
is
less
trouble
than
blankets
if
you
expect
to
spend
a
night
on
the
move
we
hove
the
huge
basket
into
the
waiting
auto
slammed
the
front
door
of
the
house
behind
us
piled
into
the
back
seat
and
were
off
i
shall
be
glad
when
this
business
is
over
said
rene
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
i
am
a
banker
by
profession
for
me
the
ebb
and
flow
of
trade
with
its
certainties
and
its
discretions
but
what
would
you
trade
must
be
prepared
for
doors
that
will
not
open
must
be
forced
those
who
stand
in
the
way
must
be
thrust
aside
this
feisul
is
an
impossible
fellow
he
is
a
hypocrite
i
tell
you
one
of
those
praters
about
righteousness
who
wo
understand
that
the
church
and
the
mosque
are
the
places
for
that
sort
of
thing
eh
you
follow
me
but
tell
me
what
has
been
done
to
daulch
hattin
and
aubek
were
they
backed
against
a
wall
and
shot
who
betrayed
them
too
bad
that
such
a
plan
should
fail
for
it
was
perfect
far
from
perfect
i
answered
for
that
one
piece
of
strategy
i
have
by
heart
the
way
to
make
a
man
tell
all
he
knows
is
to
pretend
to
superior
knowledge
heh
how
could
you
improve
on
it
three
members
of
the
staff
to
order
unexpectedly
seize
feisul
and
deliver
him
dead
or
alive
what
is
better
than
that
but
what
has
been
done
to
the
three
nothing
i
answered
just
like
him
just
like
him
i
tell
you
that
man
feisul
would
rather
be
a
martyr
than
succeed
at
his
proper
business
we
reached
the
palace
just
as
feisul
was
leaving
it
several
members
of
his
staff
were
hard
on
his
heels
in
the
porch
and
our
party
was
behind
them
again
with
mabel
last
of
all
there
was
a
line
of
waiting
autos
nearly
long
enough
to
fill
the
drive
but
an
utter
absence
of
military
fuss
and
no
shouting
or
hurry
it
looked
in
the
dark
more
like
a
funeral
than
the
departure
of
a
king
to
join
his
army
at
the
front
i
remained
in
the
car
with
the
banker
and
sent
jeremy
to
report
our
doings
to
grim
presently
i
could
see
him
standing
under
the
porch
lamp
with
a
hand
on
grim
shoulder
and
i
leaned
out
over
the
auto
door
to
watch
but
rene
the
banker
leaned
back
snuggled
up
in
his
overcoat
liking
neither
to
be
seen
nor
to
get
his
skin
wet
i
expected
to
see
the
three
staff
officers
daulch
hattin
and
aubek
arrested
there
and
then
but
nothing
happened
except
that
feisul
suddenly
drove
away
with
mabel
and
grim
in
the
same
car
with
him
there
followed
a
rush
for
the
other
cars
and
the
whole
line
started
forward
jeremy
jumping
in
as
our
car
passed
the
porch
daulch
hattin
and
aubek
are
at
the
front
he
said
and
began
humming
to
himself
at
the
front
demanded
rene
sitting
upright
suddenly
at
the
front
you
say
when
did
they
leave
for
the
front
this
evening
answered
jeremy
you
could
see
his
face
in
the
dark
but
i
think
he
was
chuckling
strange
said
the
banker
yet
you
say
they
have
been
betrayed
their
plan
is
known
yet
they
left
for
the
front
this
evening
it
was
inside
the
car
for
the
rain
swished
down
in
torrents
and
jeremy
fastened
the
flaps
after
he
got
in
rene
change
of
expression
was
a
thing
that
you
could
feel
not
see
he
kept
perfect
silence
for
about
two
minutes
while
the
car
skidded
and
bumped
at
the
rear
of
the
procession
then
you
tell
me
that
feisul
knows
and
yet
oh
i
did
tell
you
that
laughed
jeremy
it
was
this
other
man
who
said
so
i
never
deceived
anyone
i
an
honest
fellow
i
am
remember
i
warned
you
against
him
when
we
talked
in
the
hotel
you
ca
blame
me
i
told
you
he
was
up
to
mischief
i
advised
you
to
keep
a
careful
eye
on
him
and
to
look
twice
at
his
paper
wallah
you
must
be
a
lamb
in
foxskin
my
master
is
a
wolf
in
a
woolly
overcoat
wait
till
you
seen
him
eat
that
chicken
that
you
brought
and
then
you
know
what
kind
of
a
man
he
is
you
see
you
should
have
given
me
money
when
i
asked
you
for
it
i
a
fellow
with
a
price
i
am
whoever
pays
my
price
gets
his
worth
if
you
had
the
sense
to
pay
me
more
than
this
man
does
have
helped
you
trick
him
instead
of
helping
him
trick
you
but
he
gave
me
my
wages
before
dinner
and
you
gave
me
nothing
so
here
you
are
and
i
would
like
to
be
keeping
your
pair
of
trousers
warm
i
tell
you
this
ramsden
effendi
is
an
awful
fellow
who
will
stick
at
nothing
and
i
worse
because
i
honest
and
do
what
i
paid
to
do
i
took
the
precaution
of
putting
my
arm
around
rene
for
it
was
likely
that
he
had
another
weapon
hidden
somewhere
and
the
obvious
thing
for
him
to
do
was
to
shoot
the
two
of
us
and
make
a
bolt
for
it
for
a
second
i
thought
i
felt
his
hand
moving
but
it
was
jeremy
searching
all
his
pockets
and
feeling
for
hidden
steel
so
i
pulled
out
a
cigar
and
lit
a
match
of
course
anyone
face
looks
ghastly
by
that
sort
of
sudden
light
but
rene
was
a
picture
of
hate
rage
baffled
cunning
and
fear
such
as
i
had
never
seen
his
eyes
looked
like
an
animal
at
bay
and
the
way
his
lips
parted
from
his
teeth
conveyed
the
impression
that
he
was
searching
his
mind
wildly
for
a
desperate
remedy
that
would
ruin
all
concerned
except
himself
but
it
was
only
a
stale
old
recourse
that
he
had
in
a
man
extremity
he
turns
by
instinct
to
his
own
tin
gods
for
help
and
you
may
read
his
whole
heart
and
religion
then
very
well
very
well
he
said
as
if
he
were
on
the
rack
speaking
hurriedly
to
get
it
over
with
i
make
the
sacrifice
you
will
find
my
money
in
an
inner
vest
pocket
underneath
my
vest
it
is
a
savings
take
it
and
let
me
go
it
is
not
much
only
a
little
i
am
not
a
rich
man
i
had
hoped
to
be
but
it
would
mean
a
fortune
to
you
no
doubt
take
it
and
be
merciful
give
me
back
the
smaller
packet
of
the
two
keep
the
larger
and
let
me
go
out
of
curiosity
i
reached
inside
his
vest
and
pulled
out
both
packets
jeremy
struck
a
match
the
smaller
packet
contained
a
draft
on
paris
for
a
quarter
of
a
million
francs
the
larger
held
nothing
but
correspondence
i
returned
them
to
him
listen
i
said
i
never
yet
murdered
a
man
so
if
you
provide
me
with
another
excuse
for
murdering
you
you
be
a
virgin
victim
keep
that
in
mind
chapter
xv
catch
the
alfies
napping
and
kick
hell
out
of
you
no
doubt
familiar
with
the
fact
that
the
accounts
given
by
two
men
who
have
witnessed
a
battle
from
the
same
angle
will
differ
widely
not
only
in
minor
detail
but
in
fundamentals
so
you
wo
look
to
me
for
confirmation
of
any
one
of
the
countless
stories
that
have
seen
the
light
of
print
pretending
to
explain
how
the
french
won
damascus
so
easily
and
unexpectedly
i
was
only
on
the
inside
looking
outward
as
it
were
the
fellows
on
the
outside
looking
in
would
naturally
give
a
different
explanation
then
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
a
day
of
official
accounts
that
would
make
a
limping
dog
of
ananias
when
the
general
staff
of
an
invading
army
controls
all
the
wires
and
all
lines
of
communication
you
may
believe
what
they
choose
to
tell
you
if
you
wish
but
you
have
to
as
they
say
in
maine
and
i
admit
that
all
i
saw
was
from
a
curtained
auto
as
we
swayed
and
bumped
over
broken
roads
with
an
occasional
interlude
when
jeremy
and
i
got
out
to
lend
our
shoulders
and
help
the
arab
driver
heave
the
car
out
of
a
slough
my
clearest
memory
is
of
that
arab
silent
stolid
staring
like
an
owl
straight
forward
most
of
the
time
but
a
perfect
marvel
in
emergencies
when
he
would
suddenly
spring
to
life
swear
a
living
streak
of
brimstone
blasphemy
in
high
falsetto
and
perform
a
driver
miracle
by
two
hours
after
midnight
we
were
running
on
four
flat
tires
and
i
got
the
name
of
the
maker
of
those
wheels
for
future
reference
and
use
one
spring
broke
but
we
went
forward
with
a
rig
of
chain
and
rope
after
getting
more
gas
from
some
christian
monks
who
swore
they
had
any
and
wept
when
one
of
feisul
officers
demonstrated
that
they
had
you
could
see
any
monastery
i
even
know
that
there
was
one
nothing
but
lean
faces
with
tonsured
tops
that
nodded
in
unison
and
lied
fearfully
the
gunfire
began
to
be
heavy
about
that
time
although
nothing
like
the
bedlam
of
flanders
as
neither
side
could
see
the
other
and
neither
had
any
ranges
marked
my
guess
is
that
the
french
were
advertising
their
advance
doing
a
little
propaganda
that
was
cheap
for
all
concerned
except
the
and
the
syrian
army
was
shooting
back
crazily
sending
over
long
shots
on
the
off
chance
more
to
encourage
themselves
than
for
any
other
reason
the
sensation
was
rather
like
riding
in
an
ambulance
away
from
the
battle
instead
of
toward
it
for
you
could
see
anything
and
you
had
a
sense
of
helpless
detachment
from
it
all
as
if
a
power
you
control
were
carrying
you
away
from
a
familiar
destiny
to
one
that
you
could
imagine
it
was
so
much
like
a
dream
as
like
a
different
real
existence
that
you
could
understand
because
it
bore
no
kind
of
relation
to
anything
in
the
past
anyhow
we
bumped
and
blundered
on
until
dawn
came
streaked
with
wonderful
rolling
mist
and
gave
a
glimpse
at
intervals
of
a
wide
plain
sloping
toward
the
west
with
long
lines
of
infantry
and
here
and
there
guns
extended
across
it
in
parallels
drawn
north
and
south
the
rifle
firing
started
ten
minutes
after
dawn
and
it
was
all
over
in
less
than
half
an
hour
but
i
ca
describe
exactly
how
the
finish
came
because
the
wind
was
toward
us
and
the
morning
mist
blew
along
in
blanketing
white
masses
that
only
allowed
you
a
momentary
glimpse
and
then
shut
off
the
view
we
were
about
a
mile
behind
the
and
i
could
see
car
or
any
of
the
others
for
the
moment
there
was
just
one
clear
line
of
vision
straight
from
where
i
sat
to
the
nearest
infantry
i
could
see
about
fifty
yards
of
the
line
and
perhaps
that
many
men
and
they
were
blazing
away
furiously
over
a
low
earthwork
although
i
see
a
sign
of
the
french
there
was
hardly
any
artillery
firing
at
that
time
suddenly
without
any
obvious
reason
the
men
whose
backs
i
was
watching
broke
and
ran
the
mist
obscured
them
instantly
and
the
line
of
vision
shifted
so
that
bit
by
bit
i
saw
i
dare
say
a
mile
of
the
firing
line
the
whole
lot
were
running
for
their
lives
and
look
where
i
would
there
was
a
sign
of
a
frenchman
anywhere
i
should
say
it
took
about
ten
minutes
for
the
first
of
them
to
reach
the
dirt
road
where
our
autos
stood
in
mud
and
by
that
time
we
had
shoved
and
them
into
movement
our
engines
making
as
much
row
as
a
nest
of
as
they
struggled
against
the
strain
we
did
want
to
be
swamped
under
that
tide
of
fugitives
but
they
took
no
notice
of
us
they
had
thrown
away
their
weapons
and
were
running
for
home
with
eyes
distended
and
nothing
in
mind
but
to
put
distance
between
there
and
the
enemy
i
jumped
out
of
the
car
and
seized
one
man
what
are
you
running
from
what
has
happened
i
demanded
holding
him
harder
the
more
he
struggled
poison
gas
he
gasped
and
i
let
him
go
i
thought
i
caught
a
whiff
of
the
darned
stuff
then
but
that
may
have
been
imagination
poison
gas
i
said
returning
to
the
car
and
rene
made
a
fine
exhibition
of
himself
smothering
his
head
under
the
foxlined
overcoat
and
screaming
he
got
right
down
on
the
floor
of
the
car
and
lay
there
huddled
and
gasping
which
may
have
been
a
sensible
precaution
i
do
know
there
was
no
time
just
then
to
bother
with
him
the
flukey
morning
breeze
shifted
several
points
the
mist
curled
suddenly
and
began
to
flow
diagonally
across
our
line
of
cars
instead
of
toward
us
and
from
one
moment
to
the
next
you
could
see
straight
along
the
road
for
maybe
a
mile
or
more
there
was
a
sight
worth
seeing
feisul
cavalry
in
full
rout
running
away
from
ghosts
by
the
look
of
it
their
formation
hardly
yet
broken
horse
and
man
racing
with
the
wind
and
a
scattering
of
unhorsed
fugitives
streaming
behind
like
a
comet
tail
according
to
grim
who
should
know
that
cavalry
division
was
the
kingpin
of
feisul
plan
he
had
intended
to
lead
a
raid
in
person
swooping
down
the
french
flank
to
their
rear
but
the
three
staff
traitors
daulch
hattin
and
aubck
sent
forward
the
previous
evening
to
place
the
division
and
hold
it
ready
had
simply
tipped
the
french
off
to
the
whole
plan
and
at
the
critical
moment
of
feisul
arrival
on
the
scene
had
ordered
the
i
do
believe
the
french
used
more
than
a
can
or
two
of
gas
i
do
believe
they
had
more
than
a
few
cans
of
it
so
far
advanced
but
the
might
have
been
useless
without
feisul
capture
for
he
was
just
the
man
to
rally
a
routed
army
and
snatch
victory
out
of
a
defeat
nobody
knew
better
than
feisul
the
weakness
of
the
french
communications
and
the
work
of
those
three
traitors
was
only
half
done
when
the
cavalry
took
to
its
heels
the
one
man
who
could
possibly
save
the
day
had
to
be
bagged
and
handed
over
i
did
realize
all
that
of
course
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
as
they
say
you
do
in
a
climax
maybe
i
never
faced
a
climax
i
no
psychologist
and
not
at
all
given
to
review
of
sudden
situations
in
the
abstract
there
was
a
fight
or
a
riot
or
something
like
it
going
on
near
the
head
of
our
line
of
autos
the
first
two
or
three
had
come
to
a
standstill
several
in
the
middle
of
the
line
were
trying
to
wheel
outward
and
bolt
for
it
behind
the
fleeing
cavalry
and
those
at
the
tail
end
were
blocked
by
one
that
had
broken
down
of
course
everybody
was
yelling
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
and
the
hurrying
shreds
of
blown
mist
further
confounded
the
confusion
so
jeremy
and
i
ran
forward
plunging
through
the
mud
and
knocking
over
whoever
blocked
our
way
it
was
rather
fun
like
the
football
field
at
school
but
one
man
a
syrian
officer
stood
near
the
last
of
the
forward
cars
with
the
evident
purpose
of
standing
off
interference
he
took
careful
aim
at
me
with
a
revolver
fired
and
missed
i
forgot
all
about
my
own
pistol
and
went
for
him
with
a
laugh
and
a
yell
of
sheer
exhilaration
there
an
eighth
of
a
ton
of
me
mostly
bone
and
muscle
so
it
is
a
sinecure
to
have
to
stop
my
fist
when
the
rest
of
the
bulk
is
under
way
behind
it
i
landed
so
hard
on
his
nose
and
with
such
tremendous
impetus
that
he
had
enough
initial
stability
to
take
the
impact
and
bring
me
up
on
my
feet
he
went
down
like
a
ninepin
i
on
top
of
him
laughing
with
mud
in
my
teeth
and
jeremy
landed
on
top
of
the
two
of
us
holding
the
skirts
of
his
cloak
in
both
hands
as
he
jumped
jeremy
picked
up
the
fellow
revolver
and
threw
it
out
of
sight
and
the
two
of
us
ran
on
again
too
late
by
now
to
help
in
the
emergency
but
in
time
for
the
next
event
grim
had
managed
everything
although
he
was
bleeding
and
smiling
serenely
through
the
blood
hadad
was
there
not
smiling
at
all
but
bleached
white
with
excitement
he
had
brought
a
number
of
arab
officers
with
him
six
or
seven
of
whom
were
standing
on
the
board
of
the
front
car
and
all
arguing
with
feisul
who
sat
back
with
his
feet
and
hands
tied
guarded
by
narayan
singh
at
grim
feet
dead
with
bullets
through
their
heads
were
three
syrian
staff
officers
they
were
the
traitors
daulch
hattin
and
aubek
grim
pistol
was
in
his
right
hand
and
had
been
used
there
had
been
a
fight
all
over
in
two
minutes
for
the
traitors
had
arrived
on
the
scene
without
assistants
unfortunately
for
them
hadad
had
turned
up
at
the
same
moment
with
his
loyalists
narayan
singh
had
jumped
from
the
car
behind
and
seized
feisul
thrown
him
to
the
floor
out
of
the
path
of
bullets
and
tied
his
arms
it
was
actually
mabel
hardly
realizing
what
she
was
doing
but
obeying
the
sikh
orders
yelled
in
her
ear
as
he
struggled
to
keep
his
wiry
prisoner
down
who
tied
the
king
feet
using
her
arab
girdle
feisul
of
course
was
all
for
dying
at
the
head
of
a
remnant
of
his
men
that
would
be
the
first
impulse
of
any
decent
leader
in
like
circumstance
but
his
loyal
friends
eager
to
die
with
him
if
they
must
but
unwilling
to
die
at
all
if
there
were
an
alternative
were
overwhelming
him
with
streams
of
words
and
promises
suddenly
two
of
them
jumped
into
the
car
and
began
to
untie
his
arms
and
feet
grim
looking
swiftly
to
right
and
left
saw
jeremy
and
pounced
on
him
so
fiercely
that
an
onlooker
might
have
guessed
another
fight
to
the
death
was
under
way
too
excited
to
say
what
he
had
in
mind
he
tugged
at
jeremy
clothes
i
get
you
jim
i
get
you
jeremy
laughed
gaily
and
in
ten
seconds
had
stripped
himself
down
to
his
underwear
hadad
must
have
been
discussing
details
of
the
plan
with
grim
along
the
road
for
he
got
busy
at
the
same
time
persuading
feisul
to
part
with
his
garments
not
that
his
consent
really
mattered
at
the
moment
they
were
pulled
off
him
by
half
a
dozen
hands
at
once
and
jeremy
had
the
best
of
that
bargain
all
right
for
in
addition
to
silk
headdress
and
a
fine
black
arab
coat
there
was
linen
of
a
sort
you
buy
better
stuff
than
bishops
wear
and
clean
which
jeremy
own
was
the
time
it
takes
to
read
this
gives
a
totally
false
impression
of
the
speed
the
whole
thing
took
place
i
should
say
within
two
minutes
from
the
time
when
i
punched
that
syrian
nose
until
mabel
and
narayan
singh
stood
beside
me
watching
hadad
two
more
arabs
and
feisul
drive
away
with
a
second
car
crowded
full
of
loyalists
in
close
attendance
by
that
time
jeremy
was
dressed
in
feisul
clothes
and
though
he
did
look
a
bit
like
feisul
from
a
yard
away
in
the
mist
at
ten
yards
provided
you
were
looking
for
feisul
you
have
taken
your
bible
oath
he
was
the
man
for
he
had
the
gesture
and
mannerism
copied
to
perfection
however
standing
there
was
going
to
increase
the
real
chance
of
escaping
the
sooner
we
got
caught
the
quicker
the
french
would
discover
that
our
man
had
given
them
the
slip
our
business
was
to
give
the
french
a
long
chase
in
the
wrong
direction
and
those
bogged
autos
were
ideal
for
the
purpose
but
they
were
the
only
means
in
sight
just
then
and
we
had
to
bear
in
mind
that
message
i
had
made
rene
send
warning
the
french
to
look
out
for
an
auto
with
a
white
flag
and
two
civilians
together
with
feisul
and
lawrence
so
we
picked
out
the
two
best
that
remained
pitched
rene
and
his
basket
of
provisions
into
the
front
one
with
mabel
and
jeremy
piled
narayan
singh
in
after
them
to
take
my
place
as
the
second
civilian
and
started
them
off
straight
forward
grim
and
i
following
in
a
second
car
after
i
had
paid
our
former
arab
driver
handsomely
and
sent
him
off
grinning
to
give
a
lift
to
as
many
runaways
as
the
car
would
hold
we
learned
afterward
that
the
rascal
made
a
fortune
charging
as
much
as
fifty
pounds
sterling
for
the
trip
halfway
back
to
damascus
at
which
point
the
car
collapsed
they
say
he
carried
eleven
officers
that
far
bought
two
wives
with
the
proceeds
and
escaped
all
the
way
to
a
village
near
mecca
where
his
home
was
you
know
how
bewildering
and
tricky
those
early
mists
are
when
they
start
to
roll
up
before
the
wind
we
had
hardly
got
going
when
the
whole
mass
seemed
to
shift
in
one
great
cloud
covering
the
fleeing
troops
and
incidentally
feisul
but
leaving
us
in
our
two
autos
high
and
dry
as
it
were
in
full
view
of
the
french
and
they
were
advancing
by
that
time
i
could
see
more
than
a
division
of
them
that
we
would
have
to
reckon
with
nearly
all
algerians
and
they
looked
i
guess
they
had
forced
the
pace
in
advance
of
the
main
body
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
treason
of
feisul
officers
they
came
slouching
forward
with
their
rifles
at
the
trail
and
a
screen
of
skirmishers
thrown
out
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
ahead
there
were
cavalry
and
guns
far
off
on
their
right
evidently
trying
to
work
around
to
the
flank
of
the
fleeing
array
but
those
were
much
too
far
away
to
trouble
us
and
were
going
in
the
wrong
direction
rolling
banks
of
mist
shut
off
the
farther
view
to
westward
and
there
was
no
guessing
where
the
main
french
force
might
be
and
for
all
i
know
it
had
started
from
the
coast
yet
fortune
came
to
our
rescue
with
one
riderless
horse
a
splendid
arab
gelding
tied
by
the
bridle
to
the
wheel
of
a
and
left
behind
in
the
stampede
jeremy
appropriated
it
riding
arab
fashion
with
short
stirrups
and
i
would
have
blamed
feisul
own
brother
for
falsely
identifying
him
at
ten
yards
he
was
born
mischievous
and
he
caricatured
feisul
on
horseback
as
if
he
were
acting
for
the
movies
i
guess
the
french
officers
had
good
glasses
with
them
for
jeremy
had
hardly
mounted
when
the
advancing
algerians
opened
a
hot
fire
on
us
the
whole
division
surely
would
have
blazed
away
with
and
all
at
two
cars
and
a
man
on
horseback
unless
someone
had
passed
the
word
along
that
feisul
was
in
full
view
so
grim
and
i
abandoned
our
car
driver
and
all
and
jumped
into
jeremy
place
it
was
more
than
two
hundred
yards
to
the
top
of
a
gentle
rise
over
which
we
disappeared
from
view
and
just
as
we
bumped
over
it
i
wrenched
out
the
white
tablecloth
in
which
rene
chicken
and
stuff
was
wrapped
and
waved
it
violently
then
lord
what
a
sight
below
us
sheltered
between
two
flanking
hillocks
was
about
a
division
of
feisul
arab
infantry
packing
up
sulkily
preparing
to
follow
the
retreat
it
was
a
safe
bet
the
french
did
know
they
were
there
and
i
dare
say
the
same
thought
occurred
to
every
one
of
us
the
same
instant
mabel
thought
of
it
i
know
i
did
but
jeremy
voiced
it
first
heeling
his
horse
up
beside
us
what
do
you
say
jim
i
bet
you
i
can
rally
that
gang
shall
i
lead
and
lick
hell
out
of
the
algies
but
grim
shook
his
head
you
might
but
the
game
is
to
pull
the
plug
properly
get
this
lot
on
the
run
the
less
fighting
the
less
risk
of
drasticism
when
the
french
get
to
damascus
chase
off
home
so
jeremy
did
it
and
that
i
believe
accounts
for
a
story
that
got
in
the
newspapers
about
feisul
trying
to
spring
a
surprise
on
the
french
at
the
last
minute
some
french
officers
in
armored
cars
came
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
in
pursuit
of
us
three
cars
three
officers
three
and
about
a
dozen
men
one
car
quit
on
the
so
i
suppose
it
broke
down
but
its
occupants
must
have
seen
jeremy
careering
up
and
down
the
line
encouraging
those
sulky
arabs
to
get
a
move
on
and
i
suppose
they
told
tales
afterwards
to
a
newspaper
correspondent
at
the
base
anyhow
the
two
pursuing
armored
cars
did
dare
come
near
enough
to
be
dangerous
until
we
had
followed
the
retreating
arab
regiments
for
about
a
mile
and
the
algerians
appeared
over
the
coming
very
slowly
a
commenced
the
arabs
returning
it
scrappily
as
they
retreated
and
we
made
believe
there
were
other
regiments
to
be
shepherded
steering
a
northward
course
downhill
toward
broken
ground
that
could
have
suited
our
purpose
better
by
the
way
those
armored
cars
came
after
us
keeping
their
distance
it
was
clear
enough
that
they
suspected
an
ambush
so
we
had
a
clear
start
and
led
them
a
dance
in
and
out
among
boulders
and
the
branches
of
a
watercourse
jeremy
galloping
ahead
to
spy
a
course
out
whenever
they
came
in
view
we
acted
a
little
piece
for
them
making
rene
wave
the
white
cloth
while
i
protected
him
and
held
off
mabel
and
grim
who
went
through
the
motions
of
trying
to
brain
me
with
pistol
butts
two
or
three
times
they
opened
fire
more
by
way
of
forcing
a
surrender
i
think
than
with
any
intention
of
hitting
us
they
wanted
to
take
feisul
alive
it
was
like
a
game
of
fox
and
geese
and
with
jeremy
scouting
ahead
we
could
have
kept
them
dodging
us
for
hours
if
we
run
out
of
gas
then
we
abandoned
the
car
and
took
refuge
in
a
cave
that
stank
as
if
it
had
been
a
tomb
for
generations
the
french
drew
up
their
cars
fifty
yards
away
with
covering
the
cave
mouth
and
after
we
were
sure
they
were
going
to
squirt
a
stream
of
lead
at
us
i
went
out
with
the
tablecloth
to
negotiate
terms
i
did
want
to
go
but
grim
seemed
to
think
they
understand
my
french
of
course
there
was
anything
really
to
argue
about
but
i
played
for
time
because
every
minute
was
of
value
to
the
real
feisul
speeding
on
his
way
to
british
territory
the
french
officer
who
did
the
talking
for
his
side
a
little
squat
pale
fellow
who
gave
the
impression
of
having
risen
from
the
ranks
without
learning
polite
manners
on
the
way
agreed
to
accept
our
surrender
and
spare
our
lives
for
the
time
being
and
by
that
time
the
smell
in
the
cave
had
nearly
overcome
our
party
so
they
all
marched
out
and
lord
the
french
captain
was
spiteful
when
he
discovered
that
jeremy
was
feisul
after
all
he
swore
like
a
wet
cat
accused
mabel
of
being
a
spy
took
away
our
basket
of
provisions
and
i
think
would
have
shot
jeremy
out
of
hand
if
jeremy
had
started
clowning
and
made
the
other
frenchmen
laugh
laughter
and
murder
no
more
mix
than
oil
and
water
he
did
what
he
called
a
harem
dance
for
them
misusing
his
stomach
outrageously
and
the
incongruity
of
that
by
a
descendant
of
the
prophet
took
all
the
sting
out
of
the
situation
but
they
burned
our
abandoned
car
in
sheer
ill
temper
before
crowding
us
into
their
own
and
they
shot
the
good
horse
the
that
followed
was
rather
like
the
kind
they
give
pigs
on
the
way
to
the
sausage
shop
hurried
and
not
intended
to
be
mirthful
what
the
use
of
losing
tempers
i
asked
captain
jacques
daudet
who
had
captured
us
he
sat
on
my
knees
with
his
pistol
pressed
against
my
chest
why
not
regard
the
whole
thing
as
a
joke
you
done
your
best
and
nobody
can
blame
you
besides
what
can
possibly
happen
what
do
you
suppose
they
do
to
us
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
his
little
cold
blue
eyes
met
mine
you
will
all
be
shot
of
course
he
answered
after
that
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
again
but
he
cast
no
gloom
for
jeremy
kept
the
lot
of
us
french
too
excepting
daudet
in
roars
of
laughter
for
ten
miles
until
we
reached
temporary
headquarters
where
a
born
gentleman
in
a
peaked
red
cap
with
gold
on
it
sat
on
a
directing
things
he
recognized
grim
at
the
first
glance
and
knew
him
for
an
american
in
british
service
he
looked
grim
in
the
eye
and
smiled
we
told
our
story
in
turns
interrupting
one
another
and
being
interrupted
by
rene
the
officer
turned
on
the
banker
savagely
ordered
him
sent
to
the
rear
and
smiled
at
grim
again
then
he
picked
up
the
banker
belongings
including
the
two
packages
and
tossed
them
after
him
with
an
air
of
utter
contempt
whereat
he
smiled
at
all
of
us
and
you
are
quite
sure
that
the
emir
feisul
has
escaped
he
asked
well
there
are
those
whom
the
news
will
annoy
which
is
too
bad
but
ca
be
helped
for
myself
i
can
not
say
that
i
shall
shed
tears
madame
he
looked
straight
at
mabel
major
he
met
grim
eyes
and
smiled
messieurs
it
was
my
turn
and
narayan
singh
his
steady
stare
was
good
and
made
you
feel
like
shaking
hands
with
him
monsieur
scapin
clown
that
was
meant
for
jeremy
and
they
both
laughed
you
have
been
adroit
but
do
you
think
i
could
depend
on
your
discretion
we
did
our
best
to
look
discreet
you
see
madame
et
messieurs
this
is
not
warfare
we
desire
to
accomplish
a
definite
object
with
as
little
unpleasantness
as
possible
i
shall
regret
the
necessity
of
sending
you
to
beirut
but
that
is
for
your
safety
an
additional
and
very
sound
precaution
which
you
yourselves
might
take
would
be
to
preserve
complete
silence
