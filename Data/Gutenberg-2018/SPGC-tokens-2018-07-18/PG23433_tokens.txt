winter
and
summer
in
winter
when
the
air
is
chill
and
winds
are
blowing
loud
and
shrill
all
snug
and
warm
i
sit
and
purr
wrapped
in
my
overcoat
of
fur
in
summer
quite
the
other
way
i
find
it
very
hot
all
day
but
human
people
do
not
care
for
they
have
nice
thin
clothes
to
wear
and
does
it
not
seem
hard
to
you
when
all
the
world
is
like
a
stew
and
i
am
much
too
warm
to
purr
i
have
to
wear
my
winter
fur
illustration
rain
the
rain
is
raining
everywhere
kittens
to
shelter
fly
but
human
folk
wear
overshoes
to
keep
their
hind
paws
dry
illustration
the
shadow
kitten
there
a
funny
little
kitten
that
tries
to
look
like
me
but
though
i
round
and
fluffy
he
as
flat
as
flat
can
be
and
when
i
try
to
mew
to
him
he
never
makes
a
sound
and
when
i
jump
into
the
air
he
never
leaves
the
ground
he
has
a
way
of
growing
i
do
understand
at
all
sometimes
he
very
little
and
sometimes
he
very
tall
and
once
when
in
the
garden
when
the
sun
came
up
at
dawn
he
grew
so
big
i
think
he
stretched
across
the
lawn
illustration
education
when
people
think
that
kittens
play
it
really
quite
the
other
way
for
when
they
chase
the
ball
or
bobbin
they
learn
to
catch
a
mouse
or
robin
the
kitten
deaf
to
duty
call
who
will
not
chase
the
bounding
ball
a
hungry
cathood
will
enjoy
the
scorn
of
mouse
and
bird
and
boy
illustration
a
thought
it
very
nice
to
think
of
how
in
every
country
lives
a
cow
to
furnish
milk
with
all
her
might
for
kittens
comfort
and
delight
illustration
the
lion
the
lion
does
not
move
at
all
winter
or
summer
spring
or
fall
he
does
not
even
stretch
or
yawn
but
lies
in
silence
on
the
lawn
he
must
be
lazy
it
is
plain
for
there
is
moss
upon
his
mane
and
what
is
more
a
pair
of
daws
have
built
a
nest
between
his
paws
oh
lazy
lion
big
and
brown
this
is
no
time
for
lying
down
the
sun
is
shining
ca
you
see
oh
please
wake
up
and
play
with
me
illustration
the
milk
jug
the
gentle
milk
jug
blue
and
white
i
love
with
all
my
soul
she
pours
herself
with
all
her
might
to
fill
my
breakfast
bowl
all
day
she
sits
upon
the
shelf
she
does
not
jump
or
climb
she
only
waits
to
pour
herself
when
is
my
and
when
the
jug
is
empty
quite
i
shall
not
mew
in
vain
the
friendly
cow
all
red
and
white
will
fill
her
up
again
illustration
happy
thought
the
world
is
so
full
of
a
number
of
mice
i
sure
that
we
all
should
be
happy
and
nice
illustration
kitten
night
thought
when
human
folk
put
out
the
light
and
think
they
made
it
dark
as
night
a
pussy
cat
sees
every
bit
as
well
as
when
the
lights
are
lit
when
human
folk
have
gone
upstairs
and
shed
their
skins
and
said
their
prayers
and
there
is
no
one
to
annoy
then
pussy
may
her
life
enjoy
no
human
hands
to
pinch
or
slap
or
rub
her
fur
against
the
nap
or
throw
cold
water
from
a
pail
or
make
a
handle
of
her
tail
and
so
you
will
not
think
it
wrong
when
she
can
play
the
whole
night
long
with
no
one
to
disturb
her
play
that
pussy
goes
to
bed
by
day
illustration
the
puncture
when
i
was
just
a
kitten
small
they
gave
to
me
a
rubber
ball
to
roll
upon
the
floor
one
day
i
tapped
it
with
my
paw
and
pierced
the
rubber
with
my
claw
now
it
will
roll
no
more
illustration
good
and
bad
kittens
kittens
you
are
very
little
and
your
kitten
bones
are
brittle
if
you
grow
to
cats
respected
see
your
play
be
not
neglected
smite
the
sudden
spool
and
spring
upon
the
swift
elusive
string
thus
you
learn
to
catch
the
wary
mister
mouse
or
miss
canary
that
is
how
in
foreign
places
fluffy
cubs
with
kitten
faces
where
the
mango
waves
sedately
grow
to
lions
large
and
stately
but
the
kittencats
who
snatch
rudely
for
their
food
or
scratch
grow
to
tomcats
gaunt
and
gory
theirs
is
quite
another
story
cats
like
these
are
put
away
by
the
dread
or
to
trusting
aunts
and
sisters
sold
as
sable
muffs
and
wristers
illustration
illustration
anticipation
when
i
grow
up
i
mean
to
be
a
lion
large
and
fierce
to
see
i
mew
so
loud
that
cook
in
fright
will
give
me
all
the
cream
in
sight
and
anyone
who
dares
to
say
poor
puss
to
me
will
rue
the
day
then
having
swallowed
him
i
creep
into
the
guest
room
bed
to
sleep

foreign
kittens
kittens
large
and
kittens
small
prowling
on
the
back
yard
wall
though
your
fur
be
rough
and
few
i
should
like
to
play
with
you
though
you
roam
the
dangerous
street
and
have
curious
things
to
eat
though
you
sleep
in
barn
or
loft
with
no
cushions
warm
and
soft
though
you
have
to
stay
when
it
cold
or
when
it
pours
though
your
fur
is
all
askew
how
i
like
to
play
with
you
illustration
the
joy
ride
when
mistress
peggy
moves
around
her
dresses
make
a
mocking
sound
you
ca
catch
me
they
seem
to
say
i
often
steal
a
ride
that
way
illustration
facilis
ascensus
up
into
the
cherry
tree
who
should
climb
but
little
me
with
both
my
paws
i
hold
on
tight
and
look
upon
a
pleasant
sight
there
are
the
gardens
far
away
where
little
foreign
kittens
play
and
those
queer
specks
of
black
and
brown
are
naughty
cats
that
live
in
town
and
there
among
the
tulips
red
where
i
may
never
lay
my
head
i
see
the
cruel
gardener
hoe
the
baby
weeds
that
may
not
grow
now
i
climb
down
oh
dear
i
mew
which
end
goes
first
what
shall
i
do
oh
good
kind
gardener
big
and
brown
please
come
and
help
this
kitten
down
illustration
the
whole
duty
of
kittens
when
human
folk
at
table
eat
a
kitten
must
not
mew
for
meat
or
jump
to
grab
it
from
the
dish
it
happens
to
be
illustration
the
outing
my
bed
is
like
a
little
bark
the
hatch
is
battened
down
and
in
the
basket
cabin
dark
i
sail
away
from
town
now
when
they
lift
the
lid
a
scene
of
wonder
meets
my
eyes
tall
waving
green
that
seem
to
touch
the
skies
and
over
all
the
ground
is
spread
a
rug
of
emerald
sweet
most
deep
enough
to
hide
my
head
and
tickly
to
my
feet
and
here
the
cow
stands
she
the
genie
of
the
jug
beneath
the
tree
and
eats
the
emerald
rug
illustration
the
puppy
the
puppy
can
not
mew
or
talk
he
has
a
funny
kind
of
walk
his
tail
is
difficult
to
wag
and
that
what
makes
him
walk
zigzag
he
is
the
kitten
of
a
dog
from
morn
till
night
he
all
agog
forever
seeking
something
new
that
good
but
is
meant
to
chew
he
romps
about
the
tulip
bed
and
chews
the
flowers
white
and
red
and
when
the
gardener
comes
to
see
he
sure
to
blame
mamma
or
me
one
game
that
can
not
ever
fail
to
please
him
is
to
chase
his
tail
to
catch
one
tail
me
and
you
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
do
if
he
has
not
a
pretty
face
the
puppy
heart
is
in
its
place
i
sorry
he
must
grow
into
a
horrid
noisy
dog
are
you
illustration
illustration
the
moon
the
moon
is
like
a
big
round
cheese
that
shines
above
the
garden
trees
and
like
a
cheese
grows
less
each
night
as
though
some
one
had
had
a
bite
the
mouse
delights
to
nibble
cheese
the
dog
bites
anything
he
sees
but
how
could
they
bite
off
the
moon
unless
they
went
in
a
balloon
and
human
people
when
they
eat
they
think
it
rude
to
bite
their
meat
they
use
a
knife
or
fork
or
spoon
who
is
it
then
that
bites
the
moon
illustration
the
golden
cat
great
is
the
golden
cat
who
treads
the
blue
roof
garden
our
heads
the
never
tired
smiling
one
that
human
people
call
the
sun
he
stretches
forth
his
paw
at
dawn
and
though
the
blinds
are
closely
drawn
his
claws
peep
through
like
rays
of
light
to
catch
the
fluttering
bird
of
night
he
smiles
into
the
hayloft
dim
and
the
brown
hay
smiles
back
at
him
and
when
he
strokes
the
earth
green
fur
he
makes
the
fields
and
meadows
purr
his
face
is
one
big
golden
smile
it
measures
round
at
least
a
mile
how
dull
our
world
would
be
and
flat
without
the
golden
pussy
cat
illustration
an
inquiry
a
birdie
cocked
his
little
head
winked
his
eye
at
me
and
said
say
are
you
a
pussy
willer
or
just
a
pillar
illustration
a
kitten
fancy
the
kitten
mews
outside
the
door
the
in
the
tree
the
mews
upon
the
shore
the
catfish
in
the
sea
the
emu
with
his
feathers
queer
is
mewing
in
the
zoo
why
is
it
that
i
never
hear
a
mew
illustration
in
darkest
africa
at
evening
when
the
lamp
is
lit
the
tired
human
people
sit
and
doze
or
turn
with
solemn
looks
the
speckled
pages
of
their
books
then
i
the
dangerous
kitten
prowl
and
in
the
shadows
softly
growl
and
roam
about
the
farthest
floor
where
kitten
never
trod
before
and
crouching
in
the
jungle
damp
i
watch
the
human
hunter
camp
ready
to
spring
with
fearful
roar
as
soon
as
i
shall
hear
them
snore
and
then
with
stealthy
tread
i
crawl
into
the
dark
and
trackless
hall
where
the
shadows
deep
umbrellas
fold
their
wings
and
sleep
a
cuckoo
calls
and
to
their
dens
the
people
climb
like
frightened
hens
and
i
alone
and
no
one
cares
in
darkest
africa
down
stairs
illustration
illustration
the
dog
the
dog
is
black
or
white
or
brown
and
sometimes
spotted
like
a
clown
he
loves
to
make
a
foolish
noise
and
human
company
enjoys
the
human
people
pat
his
head
and
teach
him
to
pretend
he
dead
and
beg
and
fetch
and
carry
too
things
that
no
cat
will
do
at
human
jokes
however
stale
he
jumps
about
and
wags
his
tail
and
human
people
clap
their
hands
and
think
he
really
understands
they
say
good
dog
to
him
to
us
they
say
poor
puss
and
make
no
fuss
why
dogs
are
good
and
cats
are
poor
i
fail
to
understand
i
sure
to
someone
very
good
and
just
who
has
proved
worthy
of
her
trust
a
cat
will
condescend
the
dog
is
everybody
friend

the
game
watching
a
ball
on
the
end
of
a
string
watching
it
swing
back
and
to
oh
i
do
think
it
the
pleasantest
thing
ever
a
kitten
can
do
first
it
goes
this
way
then
it
goes
that
just
like
a
bird
on
the
wing
and
all
of
a
tremble
i
crouch
on
the
mat
like
a
lion
preparing
to
spring
and
now
with
a
terrible
deafening
mew
like
a
tiger
i
leap
on
my
prey
and
just
when
i
think
i
have
torn
it
in
two
it
is
up
in
the
air
and
away
