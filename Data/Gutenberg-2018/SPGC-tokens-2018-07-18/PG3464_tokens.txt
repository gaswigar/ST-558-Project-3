the

without
cutting
down
her
speed
bumped
home
the
winner
the
real
meaning
of
what
was
occurring
did
not
penetrate
to
any
of
us
it
ended
with
tish
stalking
off
into
the
woods
with
the
rabbit
in
one
hand
and
the
knife
in
the
other
as
fast
as
she
wet
a
bit
of
lawn
we
followed
with
the
pails
get
the
canoe
and
follow
i
heading
for
island
eleven
it
well
enough
for
you
tish
carberry
to
talk
about
gripping
a
horse
with
your
knees
the
older
i
get
aggie
pilkington
the
more
i
realize
that
to
take
you
anywhere
means
ruin
it
would
be
just
like
the
woman
to
refuse
to
come
any
farther
and
spoil
everything
mind
over
motor
how
tish
broke
the
law
and
some
records
i
so
many
unkind
things
have
been
said
of
the
affair
at
morris
valley
that
i
think
it
best
to
publish
a
straightforward
account
of
everything
the
ill
nature
of
the
cartoon
for
instance
which
showed
tish
in
a
pair
of
khaki
trousers
on
her
back
under
a
was
quite
uncalled
for
tish
did
not
wear
the
khaki
trousers
she
merely
took
them
along
in
case
of
emergency
nor
was
it
true
that
tish
took
aggie
along
as
a
mechanician
and
brutally
pushed
her
off
the
car
because
she
was
not
pumping
enough
oil
the
fact
was
that
aggie
sneezed
on
a
curve
and
fell
out
of
the
car
and
would
no
doubt
have
been
killed
had
she
not
been
thrown
into
a
pile
of
sand
it
was
in
early
september
that
eliza
bailey
my
cousin
decided
to
go
to
london
ostensibly
for
a
rest
but
really
to
get
some
cretonne
at
liberty
eliza
wrote
me
at
lake
penzance
asking
me
to
go
to
morris
valley
and
look
after
bettina
i
must
confess
that
i
was
eager
to
do
it
we
three
were
very
comfortable
at
mat
cottage
mat
being
the
name
charlie
sands
tish
nephew
had
given
it
being
the
initials
of
trio
not
that
i
regard
the
late
forties
as
but
tish
of
course
is
fifty
charlie
sands
who
is
on
a
newspaper
calls
us
either
the
or
the
for
beloved
aunts
although
aggie
and
i
are
not
related
to
him
bettina
mother
note
not
that
she
will
allow
you
to
do
it
or
because
she
is
entirely
able
to
take
care
of
herself
but
because
the
people
here
are
a
talky
lot
bettina
will
probably
look
after
you
she
has
come
from
college
with
a
feeling
that
i
am
old
and
decrepit
and
must
be
cared
for
she
maddens
me
with
pillows
and
cups
of
tea
and
woolen
shawls
she
thinks
morris
valley
selfish
and
idle
and
is
disappointed
in
the
church
preferring
her
presbyterianism
pure
she
is
desirous
now
of
learning
how
to
cook
if
you
decide
to
come
i
be
grateful
if
you
can
keep
her
out
of
the
kitchen
devotedly
eliza
if
you
can
keep
bettina
from
getting
married
while
i
away
i
be
very
glad
she
believes
a
woman
should
marry
and
rear
a
large
family
we
were
sitting
on
the
porch
of
the
cottage
at
lake
penzance
when
i
received
the
letter
and
i
read
it
aloud
humph
said
tish
putting
down
the
stocking
she
was
knitting
and
looking
over
her
spectacles
at
me
likes
her
presbyterianism
pure
and
believes
in
a
large
family
how
old
is
she
forty
eighteen
or
twenty
i
replied
looking
at
the
letter
i
not
anxious
to
go
she
probably
find
me
frivolous
tish
put
on
her
spectacles
and
took
the
letter
i
think
it
your
duty
lizzie
she
said
when
she
read
it
through
but
that
young
woman
needs
handling
we
better
all
go
we
can
motor
over
in
half
a
day
that
was
how
it
happened
that
bettina
bailey
sitting
on
eliza
front
piazza
decked
out
in
chintz
cushions
the
piazza
of
course
saw
a
dusty
machine
come
up
the
drive
and
stop
with
a
flourish
at
the
steps
and
from
it
alight
not
one
chaperon
but
three
after
her
first
gasp
bettina
was
game
she
was
a
pretty
girl
in
a
white
dress
and
bore
no
traces
in
her
face
of
any
stern
religious
proclivities
i
did
know
she
said
staring
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
mother
said
that
is
wo
you
go
right
upstairs
and
have
some
tea
and
lie
down
she
had
hardly
taken
her
eyes
from
tish
who
had
lifted
the
engine
hood
and
was
poking
at
the
carbureter
with
a
hairpin
no
thanks
said
tish
briskly
i
just
go
around
to
the
garage
and
oil
up
while
i
dirty
i
got
a
short
circuit
somewhere
aggie
you
and
lizzie
get
the
trunk
off
bettina
stood
by
while
we
unbuckled
and
lifted
down
our
traveling
trunk
she
did
not
speak
a
word
beyond
asking
if
we
would
wait
until
the
gardener
came
on
tish
saying
she
had
no
time
to
wait
because
she
wanted
to
put
kerosene
in
the
cylinders
before
the
engine
cooled
bettina
lapsed
into
silence
and
stood
by
watching
us
bettina
took
us
upstairs
she
had
put
drummond
natural
law
in
the
spiritual
world
on
my
table
and
a
couch
was
ready
with
pillows
and
a
knitted
slumber
robe
very
gently
she
helped
us
out
of
our
veils
and
dusters
and
closed
the
windows
for
fear
of
drafts
dear
mother
is
so
reckless
of
drafts
she
remarked
are
you
sure
you
wo
have
tea
we
had
some
blackberry
cordial
with
us
aggie
said
and
we
all
had
a
little
on
the
way
we
had
to
change
a
tire
and
it
made
us
thirsty
change
a
tire
aggie
had
taken
off
her
bonnet
and
was
pinning
on
the
small
lace
cap
she
wears
away
from
home
to
hide
where
her
hair
is
growing
thin
in
her
cap
aggie
is
a
woman
of
almost
fifty
rather
ethereal
she
pinned
on
her
cap
and
pulled
her
crimps
down
over
her
forehead
yes
she
observed
a
bridge
went
down
with
us
and
one
of
the
nails
spoiled
a
new
tire
i
told
miss
carberry
the
bridge
was
unsafe
but
she
thought
by
taking
it
very
fast
bettina
went
over
to
aggie
and
clutched
her
arm
do
you
mean
to
say
she
quavered
that
you
three
women
went
through
a
bridge
it
was
a
small
bridge
i
put
in
to
relieve
her
mind
and
only
a
foot
or
two
of
water
below
if
only
the
man
had
not
been
so
disagreeable
oh
she
said
relieved
you
had
a
man
with
you
we
never
take
a
man
with
us
aggie
said
with
dignity
this
one
was
fishing
under
the
bridge
and
he
was
most
ungentlemanly
quite
refused
to
help
and
tried
to
get
the
license
number
so
he
could
sue
us
sue
you
he
claimed
his
arm
was
broken
but
i
distinctly
saw
him
move
it
aggie
having
adjusted
her
cap
was
looking
at
it
in
the
mirror
but
dear
tish
thinks
of
everything
she
had
taken
off
the
license
plates
bettina
had
gone
really
pale
she
seemed
at
a
loss
and
impatient
at
herself
for
being
so
you
you
wo
have
tea
she
asked
no
thank
you
would
you
perhaps
you
would
prefer
whiskey
and
soda
aggie
turned
on
her
a
reproachful
eye
my
dear
girl
she
said
with
the
exception
of
a
little
wine
used
medicinally
we
drink
nothing
i
am
the
secretary
of
the
woman
prohibition
party
bettina
left
us
shortly
after
that
to
arrange
for
putting
up
letitia
and
aggie
she
gave
them
her
mother
room
and
whatever
impulse
she
may
have
had
to
put
the
presbyterian
psalter
by
the
bed
she
restrained
it
by
midnight
drummond
natural
law
had
disappeared
from
my
table
and
a
novel
had
taken
its
place
but
bettina
had
not
lost
her
air
of
bewilderment
that
first
evening
was
very
quiet
a
young
man
in
white
flannels
called
and
he
and
letitia
spent
a
delightful
evening
on
the
porch
talking
and
carbureters
bettina
sat
in
a
corner
and
looked
at
the
moon
spoken
to
she
replied
in
monosyllables
in
a
carefully
sweet
tone
the
young
man
name
was
jasper
mccutcheon
it
developed
that
jasper
owned
an
old
which
he
kept
in
the
bailey
garage
and
he
and
tish
went
out
to
look
it
over
they
very
politely
asked
us
all
to
go
along
but
bettina
refusing
aggie
and
i
sat
with
her
and
looked
at
the
moon
aggie
in
her
capacity
as
chaperon
or
as
one
of
an
association
of
chaperons
used
the
opportunity
to
examine
bettina
on
the
subject
of
jasper
he
seems
a
nice
boy
she
remarked
aggie
idea
of
a
nice
boy
is
one
who
in
summer
wears
fresh
flannels
outside
in
winter
less
conspicuously
does
he
live
near
next
door
sweetly
but
coolly
he
is
very
ears
spoil
him
too
large
does
he
come
around
er
often
only
two
or
three
times
a
day
on
sunday
of
course
we
see
more
of
him
aggie
looked
at
me
in
the
moonlight
clearly
the
young
man
from
the
next
door
needed
watching
it
was
well
we
had
come
i
suppose
you
like
the
same
things
she
suggested
similar
tastes
and
er
all
that
bettina
stretched
her
arms
over
her
head
and
yawned
not
so
you
could
notice
it
she
said
coolly
i
ca
thick
of
anything
we
agree
on
he
is
an
episcopalian
i
a
presbyterian
he
approves
of
suffrage
for
women
i
do
not
he
is
a
republican
i
a
progressive
he
disapproves
of
large
families
i
approve
of
them
if
people
can
afford
them
aggie
sat
straight
up
i
hope
you
do
discuss
that
she
exclaimed
bettina
smiled
how
nice
to
find
that
you
are
really
just
nice
elderly
ladies
after
all
she
said
of
course
we
discuss
it
is
it
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
when
i
was
a
girl
i
said
tartly
we
married
first
and
discussed
those
things
afterward
of
course
you
did
aunt
lizzie
she
said
smiling
alluringly
she
was
the
prettiest
girl
i
think
i
have
ever
seen
and
that
night
she
was
beautiful
and
you
raised
enormous
families
who
religiously
walked
to
church
in
their
bare
feet
to
save
their
shoes
i
did
nothing
of
the
sort
i
snapped
it
seems
to
me
aggie
put
in
gently
that
you
make
very
little
of
love
aggie
was
once
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
young
man
named
wiggins
a
roofer
by
trade
who
was
killed
in
the
act
of
inspecting
a
tin
gutter
on
a
rainy
day
he
slipped
and
fell
over
breaking
his
neck
as
a
result
bettina
smiled
at
aggie
not
at
all
she
said
the
day
of
blind
love
is
gone
that
all
gone
like
the
day
of
the
chaperon
neither
of
us
cared
to
pursue
this
and
tish
at
that
moment
appearing
with
jasper
aggie
and
i
made
a
move
toward
bed
but
jasper
not
going
and
none
of
us
caring
to
leave
him
alone
with
bettina
we
sat
down
again
we
sat
until
one
at
the
end
of
that
time
jasper
rose
and
saying
something
about
its
being
almost
bedtime
strolled
off
next
door
aggie
was
sound
asleep
in
her
chair
and
tish
was
dozing
as
for
bettina
she
had
said
hardly
a
word
after
eleven
aggie
and
tish
as
i
have
said
were
occupying
the
same
room
i
went
to
sleep
the
moment
i
got
into
bed
and
must
have
slept
three
or
four
hours
when
i
was
awakened
by
a
shot
a
moment
later
a
dozen
or
more
shots
were
fired
in
rapid
succession
and
i
sat
bolt
upright
in
bed
across
the
street
some
one
was
raising
a
window
and
a
man
called
what
the
matter
twice
there
was
no
response
and
no
further
sound
shaking
in
every
limb
i
found
the
light
switch
and
looked
at
the
time
it
was
four
in
the
morning
and
quite
dark
some
one
was
moving
in
the
hall
outside
and
whimpering
i
opened
the
door
hurriedly
and
aggie
half
fell
into
the
room
tish
is
murdered
lizzie
she
said
and
collapsed
on
the
floor
in
a
heap
nonsense
she
not
in
her
room
or
in
the
house
and
i
heard
shots
well
aggie
was
right
tish
was
not
in
her
room
there
was
a
sort
of
horrible
stillness
everywhere
as
we
stood
there
clutching
at
each
other
and
listening
she
heard
burglars
downstairs
and
has
gone
down
after
them
and
this
is
what
has
happened
oh
tish
brave
tish
aggie
cried
hysterically
and
at
that
bettina
came
in
with
her
hair
over
her
shoulders
and
asked
us
if
we
had
heard
anything
when
we
told
her
about
tish
she
insisted
on
going
downstairs
and
with
aggie
carrying
her
box
and
i
carrying
the
blackberry
cordial
we
went
down
the
lower
floor
was
quiet
and
empty
the
man
across
the
street
had
put
down
his
window
and
gone
back
to
bed
and
everything
was
still
bettina
in
her
went
out
on
the
porch
and
turned
on
the
light
tish
was
not
there
nor
was
there
a
body
lying
on
the
lawn
it
was
back
of
the
house
by
the
garage
bettina
said
if
only
jasper
and
at
that
moment
jasper
came
into
the
circle
of
light
he
had
a
norfolk
coat
on
over
his
pajamas
and
a
pair
of
slippers
and
he
was
running
calling
over
his
shoulder
to
some
one
behind
as
he
ran
watch
the
drive
he
yelled
i
saw
him
duck
round
the
corner
we
could
hear
other
footsteps
now
and
somebody
panting
near
us
aggie
was
sitting
huddled
in
a
porch
chair
crying
and
bettina
in
the
hall
was
trying
to
get
down
from
the
wall
a
moorish
knife
that
eliza
bailey
had
picked
up
somewhere
john
we
heard
jasper
calling
john
quick
i
got
him
he
was
just
at
the
corner
of
the
porch
my
heart
stopped
and
then
rushed
on
a
thousand
a
minute
then
take
your
hands
off
me
said
tish
voice
the
next
moment
tish
came
majestically
into
the
circle
of
light
and
mounted
the
steps
jasper
with
his
mouth
open
stood
below
looking
up
and
a
hired
man
in
what
looked
like
a
bed
quilt
was
behind
in
the
shadow
tish
was
completely
dressed
in
her
motoring
clothes
even
to
her
goggles
she
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
but
stalked
across
the
porch
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairway
none
of
us
moved
until
we
heard
the
door
of
her
room
slam
above
poor
old
dear
said
bettina
she
been
walking
in
her
sleep
but
the
shots
gasped
aggie
some
one
was
shooting
at
her
conscious
now
of
his
costume
jasper
had
edged
close
to
the
veranda
and
stood
in
its
shadow
walking
in
her
sleep
of
course
he
said
heartily
the
trip
was
too
much
for
her
but
think
of
her
getting
into
that
garage
with
her
eyes
shut
or
do
have
their
eyes
shut
and
actually
cranking
up
my
racer
aggie
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
aggie
of
course
jasper
went
on
there
being
no
muffler
on
it
the
racket
wakened
her
as
well
as
the
neighborhood
and
then
the
way
we
chased
her
poor
old
dear
said
bettina
again
i
going
in
to
make
her
some
tea
i
think
said
jasper
that
i
need
a
bit
of
tea
too
if
you
will
put
out
the
porch
lights
i
come
up
and
have
some
but
aggie
and
i
said
nothing
we
knew
tish
never
walked
in
her
sleep
she
had
meant
to
try
out
jasper
at
dawn
forgetting
that
racers
have
no
mufflers
and
she
had
been
as
one
may
say
hoist
with
her
own
petard
although
i
do
not
know
what
a
petard
is
and
have
never
been
able
to
find
out
we
drank
our
tea
but
tish
refused
to
have
any
or
to
reply
to
our
knocks
preserving
a
sulky
silence
also
she
had
locked
aggie
out
and
i
was
compelled
to
let
her
sleep
in
my
room
i
was
almost
asleep
when
aggie
spoke
did
you
think
there
was
anything
queer
about
the
way
that
jasper
boy
said
to
bettina
she
asked
drowsily
i
did
hear
him
say
that
was
it
he
did
i
think
she
yawned
i
think
he
kissed
her
ii
tish
was
down
early
to
breakfast
that
morning
and
her
manner
forbade
any
mention
of
the
night
before
aggie
however
noticed
that
she
ate
her
cereal
with
her
left
hand
and
used
her
right
arm
only
when
absolutely
necessary
once
before
tish
had
almost
broken
an
arm
cranking
a
car
and
had
been
driven
to
arnica
compresses
for
a
week
but
this
time
we
dared
not
suggest
anything
shortly
after
breakfast
she
came
down
to
the
porch
where
aggie
and
i
were
knitting
i
hurt
my
arm
lizzie
she
said
i
wish
you
come
out
and
crank
the
car
you
better
stay
at
home
with
an
arm
like
that
i
replied
stiffly
very
well
i
crank
it
myself
where
are
you
going
to
the
drug
store
for
arnica
bettina
was
not
there
so
i
turned
on
tish
sharply
i
go
of
course
i
said
but
i
not
go
without
speaking
my
mind
letitia
carberry
by
and
large
i
stood
by
you
for
years
and
now
in
the
weakness
of
your
age
i
not
going
to
leave
you
but
i
warn
you
tish
if
you
touch
that
again
i
send
for
charlie
sands
i
have
any
intention
of
touching
it
again
said
tish
meekly
enough
but
i
wish
i
could
buy
a
racer
cheap
what
for
aggie
demanded
tish
looked
at
her
with
scorn
to
hold
flowers
on
the
she
snapped
it
being
necessary
of
course
to
leave
a
chaperon
with
bettina
because
of
the
jasper
person
habit
of
coming
over
at
any
hour
of
the
day
we
left
aggie
with
instructions
to
watch
them
both
tish
and
i
drove
to
the
drug
store
together
and
from
there
to
a
garage
for
gasoline
i
have
never
learned
to
say
gas
for
gasoline
it
seems
to
me
as
absurd
as
if
i
were
to
say
but
for
butter
considering
that
aggie
was
quite
sulky
at
being
left
it
is
absurd
for
her
to
assume
an
air
of
virtue
over
what
followed
that
day
aggie
was
only
like
a
lot
of
people
good
because
she
was
not
tempted
for
it
was
at
the
garage
that
we
met
ellis
we
had
stopped
the
engine
and
tish
was
quarreling
with
the
man
about
the
price
of
gasoline
when
i
saw
him
a
young
man
in
a
checked
suit
and
a
panama
hat
he
came
over
and
stood
looking
at
tish
machine
nice
lines
to
that
car
he
said
built
for
speed
is
she
what
do
you
get
out
of
her
tish
heard
him
and
turned
get
out
of
her
she
said
bills
mostly
well
that
the
way
with
most
of
them
he
remarked
looking
steadily
at
tish
a
machine
a
rich
man
toy
the
only
way
to
own
one
is
to
have
it
endowed
like
a
university
but
i
meant
speed
what
can
you
make
never
had
a
chance
to
find
out
tish
said
grimly
between
nervous
women
in
the
machine
and
constables
outside
i
have
the
hour
habit
i
going
to
exchange
the
speedometer
for
a
vacuum
bottle
he
smiled
i
do
think
you
fair
to
yourself
mostly
if
forgive
me
i
can
tell
a
woman
driving
as
far
off
as
i
can
see
the
machine
but
you
are
a
very
fine
driver
the
way
you
brought
that
car
in
here
impressed
me
considerably
she
need
not
pretend
she
crawls
along
the
road
i
said
with
some
sarcasm
the
bills
she
complains
of
are
mostly
fines
for
speeding
no
said
the
young
man
delighted
good
i
glad
to
hear
it
so
are
mine
after
that
we
got
along
famously
he
had
his
car
there
a
low
gray
thing
that
looked
like
an
armored
cruiser
i
like
you
ladies
to
try
her
he
said
she
can
move
but
she
is
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
a
lady
friend
of
mine
once
threaded
a
needle
as
an
experiment
while
going
miles
an
hour
in
this
car
in
this
car
looking
back
i
do
not
recall
just
how
the
thing
started
i
believe
tish
expressed
a
desire
to
see
the
car
go
and
ellis
said
he
could
let
her
out
on
the
roads
but
that
the
at
the
was
open
and
if
we
cared
to
drive
down
there
in
tish
car
he
would
show
us
her
paces
as
he
called
it
from
that
to
going
to
the
and
from
that
to
tish
getting
in
beside
him
on
the
mechanician
seat
and
going
round
once
or
twice
was
natural
i
refused
i
did
like
the
look
of
the
thing
tish
came
back
with
a
cinder
in
her
eye
and
full
of
enthusiasm
it
was
magnificent
lizzie
she
said
the
only
word
for
it
is
sublime
you
see
nothing
there
is
just
the
rush
of
the
wind
and
the
roar
of
the
engine
and
a
wonderful
feeling
of
flying
here
see
if
you
can
find
this
cinder
wo
you
try
it
miss
er
lizzie
no
thanks
i
replied
i
can
get
all
the
roar
and
rush
of
wind
i
want
in
front
of
an
electric
fan
and
no
danger
he
stood
by
looking
out
over
the
oval
track
while
i
took
three
cinders
from
tish
eye
great
track
he
said
it
a
of
course
but
it
in
bully
shape
the
county
fair
is
held
there
and
these
fellows
make
a
big
feature
of
their
i
came
up
here
to
persuade
them
to
hold
an
automobile
meet
but
they
got
cold
feet
an
the
proposition
what
was
the
proposition
asked
tish
well
he
said
it
was
something
like
this
i
been
turning
the
trick
all
over
the
country
and
it
works
like
a
charm
the
town
ahead
in
money
and
business
for
an
automobile
race
always
brings
a
big
crowd
the
track
owners
make
the
gate
money
and
the
get
the
prizes
everybody
ahead
it
a
clean
sport
too
i
do
approve
of
racing
for
money
tish
said
decidedly
but
ellis
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
really
hardly
racing
for
money
he
explained
the
prizes
cover
the
expenses
of
the
which
are
heavy
naturally
the
cars
alone
cost
a
young
fortune
i
see
said
tish
i
had
thought
of
it
in
that
light
well
why
did
morris
valley
jump
at
the
chance
he
hesitated
a
moment
before
he
answered
it
was
my
fault
really
he
said
they
were
willing
enough
to
have
the
races
but
it
was
a
matter
of
money
i
made
them
a
proposition
to
duplicate
whatever
prize
money
they
offered
and
in
return
i
was
to
have
half
the
gate
receipts
and
the
betting
privileges
tish
quite
stiffened
clean
sport
she
said
sarcastically
with
betting
privileges
you
do
quite
understand
dear
lady
he
explained
even
in
the
cleanest
sport
we
can
not
prevent
a
man
having
an
opinion
and
backing
it
with
his
own
money
what
i
intended
to
do
was
to
regulate
it
regulate
it
tish
was
quite
mollified
well
of
course
she
said
i
suppose
since
it
must
be
it
is
better
er
regulated
but
why
have
you
succeeded
an
unfortunate
thing
happened
just
as
i
had
the
deal
about
to
close
he
replied
and
drew
a
long
breath
the
town
had
raised
hundred
i
was
to
duplicate
the
amount
but
just
at
that
time
a
a
young
brother
of
mine
in
the
west
got
into
difficulties
and
i
but
why
go
into
family
matters
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
for
me
to
pay
my
part
of
the
purse
out
of
my
share
of
the
gate
money
but
the
committee
demands
cash
on
the
table
i
have
got
it
tish
stood
up
in
her
car
and
looked
out
over
the
track
hundred
dollars
is
a
lot
of
money
young
man
not
so
much
when
you
realize
that
the
gate
money
will
probably
amount
to
twelve
thousand
tish
turned
and
surveyed
the
grandstand
that
thing
does
seat
twelve
hundred
two
thousand
people
in
the
grandstand
that
four
thousand
dollars
four
thousand
standing
inside
the
ropes
at
a
dollar
each
four
thousand
more
and
say
eight
hundred
machines
parked
in
the
oval
there
at
five
dollars
a
car
four
thousand
more
that
twelve
thousand
for
the
gate
money
alone
then
there
are
the
concessions
to
sell
peanuts
toy
balloons
lemonade
and
fans
the
and
permits
it
a
bonanza
fourteen
thousand
anyhow
half
of
fourteen
thousand
is
seven
said
tish
dreamily
seven
thousand
less
hundred
is
hundred
dollars
profit
hundred
dear
lady
corrected
ellis
watching
her
hundred
dollars
profit
to
be
made
in
two
weeks
and
nothing
to
do
to
get
it
but
sit
still
and
watch
it
coming
i
can
read
tish
like
a
book
and
i
saw
what
was
in
her
mind
letitia
carberry
i
said
sternly
you
take
my
warning
and
keep
clear
of
this
foolishness
if
money
comes
as
easy
as
that
it
ai
honest
why
not
demanded
ellis
we
give
them
their
money
worth
do
we
they
pay
two
dollars
for
a
theater
seat
without
half
the
thrills
no
chances
of
seeing
a
car
turn
turtle
or
break
its
and
dash
into
the
two
dollars
worth
it
twenty
but
tish
had
had
a
moment
to
consider
and
the
business
settled
it
she
shook
her
head
i
not
interested
ellis
she
said
coldly
i
could
sleep
at
night
if
i
thought
i
been
the
cause
of
anything
turning
turtle
or
dashing
into
the
dear
lady
he
said
shocked
i
had
no
idea
of
asking
you
to
help
me
out
of
my
difficulties
anyhow
while
matters
are
at
a
standstill
probably
some
shrewd
here
will
come
forward
before
long
and
make
a
nice
profit
on
a
small
investment
as
we
drove
away
from
the
fair
grounds
tish
was
very
silent
but
just
as
we
reached
the
bailey
place
with
bettina
and
young
jasper
mccutcheon
batting
a
ball
about
on
the
tennis
court
tish
turned
to
me
you
need
look
like
that
lizzie
she
said
i
not
even
thinking
of
backing
an
automobile
race
although
i
do
see
why
i
should
so
far
as
that
goes
but
it
curious
is
it
that
i
got
hundred
dollars
from
cousin
angeline
estate
not
even
earning
four
per
cent
i
got
out
grimly
and
jerked
at
my
you
put
it
in
a
mortgage
tish
i
advised
her
with
severity
in
every
tone
it
may
not
be
so
fast
as
an
automobile
race
or
so
likely
to
turn
turtle
or
break
its
but
it
safe
huh
said
tish
reaching
for
the
gear
lever
and
about
as
exciting
as
a
cold
pork
chop
and
furthermore
i
interjected
if
you
go
into
this
thing
now
that
your
eyes
are
open
i
send
for
charlie
sands
you
and
charlie
sands
said
tish
viciously
jamming
at
her
gears
ought
to
go
and
live
in
an
old
ladies
home
away
from
this
cruel
world
aggie
was
sitting
under
a
sunshade
in
the
broiling
sun
at
the
tennis
court
she
said
she
had
not
left
bettina
and
jasper
for
a
moment
and
that
they
had
evidently
quarreled
although
she
did
not
know
when
having
listened
to
every
word
they
said
for
the
last
she
said
they
had
not
spoken
at
all
young
people
in
love
are
very
foolish
she
said
rising
stiffly
they
should
be
happy
in
the
present
who
knows
what
the
future
may
hold
i
knew
she
was
thinking
of
wiggins
and
the
icy
roof
so
i
patted
her
shoulder
and
sent
her
up
to
put
cold
cloths
on
her
head
for
fear
of
sunstroke
then
i
sat
down
in
the
broiling
sun
and
chaperoned
bettina
until
luncheon
iii
jasper
took
dinner
with
us
that
night
he
came
across
the
lawn
freshly
shaved
and
in
clean
white
flannels
just
as
dinner
was
announced
and
said
he
had
seen
a
chocolate
cake
cooling
on
the
kitchen
porch
and
that
it
was
a
sort
of
unwritten
social
law
that
when
the
baileys
happened
to
have
a
chocolate
cake
at
dinner
they
had
him
also
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
object
to
in
this
evidently
he
was
right
for
we
found
his
place
laid
at
the
table
the
meal
was
quite
cheerful
although
jasper
ate
the
way
some
people
play
the
piano
by
touch
with
his
eyes
on
bettina
and
he
gave
no
evidence
at
dessert
of
a
fondness
for
chocolate
cake
sufficient
to
justify
a
standing
invitation
after
dinner
we
went
out
on
the
veranda
and
under
cover
of
showing
me
a
sunset
jasper
took
me
round
the
corner
of
the
house
once
there
he
entirely
forgot
the
sunset
miss
lizzie
he
began
at
once
what
have
i
done
to
you
to
have
you
treat
me
like
this
i
i
asked
amazed
all
three
of
you
did
did
bettina
mother
warn
you
against
me
the
girl
has
to
be
chaperoned
but
not
jailed
miss
lizzie
not
jailed
do
you
know
that
i
have
had
a
word
with
bettina
alone
since
you
came
why
should
you
want
to
say
anything
we
can
not
hear
miss
lizzie
he
said
desperately
do
you
want
to
hear
me
propose
to
her
for
i
reached
the
point
where
if
i
do
propose
to
bettina
soon
i
i
propose
to
somebody
you
better
be
warned
in
time
it
might
be
you
or
miss
aggie
i
weakened
at
that
the
lord
never
saw
fit
to
send
me
a
man
i
could
care
enough
about
to
marry
or
one
who
cared
enough
about
me
but
i
look
at
the
boy
face
and
not
be
sorry
for
him
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
i
asked
come
for
a
walk
with
us
he
begged
then
sprain
your
ankle
or
get
tired
i
do
care
which
tell
us
to
go
on
and
come
back
for
you
later
do
you
see
you
can
sit
down
by
the
road
somewhere
i
wo
lie
i
said
firmly
if
i
really
get
tired
i
say
so
if
i
do
you
will
he
was
gleeful
we
walk
until
you
do
you
see
it
like
this
miss
lizzie
bettina
was
all
for
me
in
spite
of
our
differing
on
religion
and
politics
and
i
know
all
about
your
differences
i
put
in
hastily
until
a
new
chap
came
to
town
a
fellow
named
ellis
runs
a
sporty
car
and
has
every
girl
in
the
town
lashed
to
the
mast
he
a
novelty
and
i
not
so
far
i
have
kept
him
away
from
bettina
but
at
any
time
they
may
meet
and
it
will
be
with
me
i
am
not
defending
my
conduct
i
am
only
explaining
eliza
bailey
herself
would
have
done
what
i
did
under
the
circumstances
i
went
for
a
walk
with
bettina
and
jasper
shortly
after
my
talk
with
jasper
leaving
tish
with
the
evening
paper
and
aggie
inhaling
a
cubeb
cigarette
her
hay
fever
having
threatened
a
return
and
what
is
more
i
tired
within
three
blocks
of
the
house
where
i
saw
a
grassy
bank
beside
the
road
bettina
wished
to
stay
with
me
but
i
said
in
obedience
to
eyes
that
i
liked
to
sit
alone
and
listen
to
the
crickets
and
for
them
to
go
on
the
last
i
saw
of
them
jasper
had
drawn
bettina
arm
through
his
and
was
walking
beside
her
with
his
head
bent
talking
i
sat
for
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
and
was
growing
uneasy
about
dew
and
my
rheumatism
when
i
heard
footsteps
and
looking
up
i
saw
aggie
coming
toward
me
she
was
not
surprised
to
see
me
and
addressed
me
coldly
i
thought
as
much
she
said
i
expected
better
of
you
lizzie
that
boy
asked
me
and
i
refused
i
dare
say
he
asked
tish
also
for
you
who
pride
yourself
on
your
strength
of
mind
i
was
tired
i
said
i
was
to
sprain
my
ankle
she
observed
sarcastically
i
just
thought
as
i
was
sitting
there
alone
where
tish
a
young
man
named
ellis
came
and
took
her
out
for
a
ride
said
aggie
he
could
take
us
both
as
the
car
holds
only
two
i
got
up
and
stared
at
aggie
in
the
twilight
you
come
straight
home
with
me
aggie
pilkington
i
said
sternly
but
what
about
bettina
and
jasper
let
alone
i
said
they
safe
enough
what
we
need
to
keep
an
eye
on
is
letitia
carberry
and
her
cousin
angeline
legacy
but
i
was
too
late
tish
and
ellis
whirled
up
to
the
door
at
eight
and
tish
did
not
even
notice
that
bettina
was
absent
she
took
off
her
veil
and
said
something
about
ellis
having
heard
a
grinding
in
the
differential
of
her
car
that
afternoon
and
that
he
suspected
a
chip
of
steel
in
the
gears
they
went
out
together
to
the
garage
leaving
aggie
and
me
staring
at
each
other
ellis
was
carrying
a
box
of
tools
jasper
and
bettina
returned
shortly
after
and
even
in
the
dusk
i
knew
things
had
gone
badly
for
him
he
sat
on
the
steps
looking
out
across
the
dark
lawn
and
spoke
in
monosyllables
bettina
however
was
very
gay
it
was
evident
that
bettina
had
decided
not
to
take
her
presbyterianism
into
the
episcopal
fold
and
although
i
am
a
presbyterian
myself
i
felt
sorry
tish
and
ellis
came
round
to
the
porch
about
ten
and
he
was
presented
to
bettina
from
that
moment
there
was
no
question
in
my
mind
as
to
how
affairs
were
going
or
in
jasper
either
he
refused
to
move
and
sat
doggedly
on
the
steps
but
he
took
little
part
in
the
conversation
ellis
was
a
good
talker
especially
about
himself
you
be
glad
to
know
he
said
to
me
that
i
got
this
race
matter
fixed
up
finally
in
two
weeks
from
now
we
have
a
little
excitement
here
i
looked
toward
tish
but
she
said
nothing
excitement
is
where
i
live
said
ellis
if
i
do
find
any
waiting
i
make
it
if
you
are
looking
for
excitement
we
have
to
find
you
some
jasper
said
pointedly
ellis
only
laughed
do
put
yourself
out
dear
boy
he
said
i
have
enough
for
present
necessities
if
you
think
an
automobile
race
is
an
easy
thing
to
manage
try
it
every
man
who
drives
a
has
a
soprano
beaten
to
death
for
temperament
then
every
has
quirky
spells
there
the
local
committee
to
propitiate
the
track
to
look
after
and
if
that
is
enough
there
the
promotion
itself
the
advertising
that
my
stunt
the
advertising
it
a
wonderful
business
is
it
asked
bettina
to
take
a
mile
or
so
of
dirt
track
and
turn
it
into
a
sort
of
stage
with
drama
every
minute
and
sometimes
tragedy
wait
a
moment
said
ellis
i
want
to
put
that
down
i
use
it
somewhere
in
the
advertising
he
wrote
by
the
light
of
a
match
while
we
all
sat
rather
stunned
by
both
his
personality
and
his
alertness
everything
grist
that
comes
to
my
mill
i
suppose
you
all
remember
when
i
completed
the
speedway
at
indianapolis
and
had
the
governor
of
indiana
lay
a
gold
brick
at
the
entrance
great
stunt
that
but
the
best
part
of
that
story
never
reached
the
public
bettina
was
leaning
forward
all
ears
and
thrills
what
was
that
she
asked
i
had
the
gold
brick
stolen
that
night
did
it
myself
and
carried
the
brick
away
in
my
pocket
only
you
know
cost
eight
or
nine
dollars
all
told
and
brought
a
million
dollars
in
advertising
but
the
papers
were
sore
about
some
passes
and
would
use
the
story
too
bad
we
ca
use
the
brick
here
still
have
it
kicking
about
somewhere
it
was
then
i
think
that
jasper
yawned
loudly
apologized
said
and
lounged
away
across
the
lawn
bettina
hardly
knew
he
was
going
she
was
bending
forward
her
chin
in
her
palms
listening
to
ellis
tell
about
a
driver
in
a
motor
race
breaking
his
wrist
cranking
a
car
and
how
he
ellis
had
jumped
into
the
car
and
driven
it
to
victory
even
aggie
was
enthralled
it
seemed
as
if
in
the
last
hour
the
great
world
of
stress
and
keen
wits
and
endeavor
and
mad
speed
had
sat
down
on
our
as
tish
said
when
we
were
going
up
to
bed
why
should
ellis
brag
he
had
something
to
brag
about
iv
although
i
felt
quite
sure
that
tish
had
put
up
the
prize
money
for
ellis
i
could
not
be
certain
and
tish
attitude
at
that
time
did
not
invite
inquiry
she
took
long
rides
daily
with
the
ellis
man
in
his
gray
car
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
their
objective
point
was
always
the
same
the
ellis
was
the
busiest
man
in
morris
valley
in
the
daytime
he
was
superintending
putting
the
track
in
condition
writing
what
he
called
promotion
stuff
securing
entries
and
forming
the
center
of
excited
groups
at
the
drug
store
and
one
or
other
of
the
two
public
garages
in
the
evenings
he
was
generally
to
be
found
at
bettina
feet
jasper
did
not
come
over
any
more
he
sauntered
past
evening
after
evening
very
much
and
carrying
a
tennis
racket
and
once
or
twice
he
took
out
his
old
and
later
shot
by
the
house
with
a
flutter
of
veils
and
a
motor
coat
beside
him
aggie
was
exceedingly
sorry
for
him
and
even
went
the
length
of
having
the
cook
bake
a
chocolate
cake
and
put
it
on
the
window
sill
to
cool
it
had
however
no
perceptible
effect
except
to
draw
from
ellis
who
had
been
round
at
the
garage
looking
at
jasper
old
racer
a
remark
that
he
was
exceedingly
fond
of
cake
and
if
he
were
urged
that
was
i
believe
a
week
before
the
race
the
big
city
papers
had
taken
it
up
according
to
ellis
and
entries
were
pouring
in
that
the
trouble
on
a
small
track
he
said
we
ca
crowd
a
dozen
cars
will
be
about
the
limit
even
with
using
the
cattle
pens
for
repair
pits
we
ca
look
after
more
than
a
dozen
did
i
tell
you
heckert
had
entered
his
bonor
no
we
exclaimed
as
far
as
aggie
and
i
were
concerned
the
bonor
might
have
been
a
new
sort
of
dog
yes
and
johnson
his
sampler
it
going
to
be
some
race
eh
what
jasper
sauntered
over
that
evening
possibly
a
late
result
of
the
cake
after
all
he
greeted
us
affably
as
if
his
defection
of
the
past
week
had
been
merely
incidental
and
sat
down
on
the
steps
i
been
thinking
ellis
he
said
that
i
like
to
enter
my
car
what
said
ellis
not
that
my
racer
i
not
much
for
speed
but
there
a
sort
of
feeling
in
the
town
that
the
locality
ought
to
be
represented
as
i
the
only
owner
of
a
speed
car
speed
car
said
ellis
and
chuckled
my
dear
boy
we
got
heckert
with
his
bonor
never
heard
of
him
jasper
lighted
a
cigarette
anyhow
what
that
to
me
i
do
like
to
race
i
got
less
speed
mania
than
any
owner
of
a
race
car
you
ever
met
but
the
honor
of
the
town
seems
to
demand
a
sacrifice
and
i
it
you
can
try
out
for
it
anyhow
said
ellis
i
do
think
you
make
it
but
if
you
qualify
all
right
but
do
let
any
other
town
people
from
a
sense
of
mistaken
local
pride
enter
a
street
roller
or
a
traction
engine
jasper
colored
but
kept
his
temper
aggie
however
spoke
up
indignantly
mccutcheon
car
was
a
very
fine
racer
when
it
was
built
mortuis
nil
nisi
remarked
ellis
and
getting
up
said
jasper
sat
on
the
steps
and
watched
him
disappear
then
he
turned
to
tish
miss
letitia
he
said
do
you
think
you
are
wise
to
drive
that
racer
of
his
the
way
you
have
been
doing
aggie
gave
a
little
gasp
and
promptly
sneezed
as
she
does
when
she
is
excited
i
said
tish
you
he
smiled
not
that
i
do
admire
your
courage
i
do
but
the
other
day
now
when
you
lost
a
tire
and
went
into
the
ditch
tish
from
you
were
fortunate
but
when
a
racer
turns
over
the
results
are
not
pleasant
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
tish
coldly
it
was
a
not
a
ditch
jasper
got
up
and
threw
away
his
cigarette
well
our
departing
friend
is
not
the
only
one
who
can
quote
latin
he
said
miss
tish
everybody
bettina
bettina
was
very
cool
as
i
went
up
to
bed
that
night
i
thought
jasper
chances
poor
indeed
as
for
tish
i
endeavored
to
speak
a
few
word
of
remonstrance
to
her
but
she
opened
her
bible
and
began
to
read
the
lesson
for
the
day
and
i
was
obliged
to
beat
a
retreat
it
was
that
night
that
aggie
and
i
having
decided
the
situation
was
beyond
us
wrote
a
letter
to
charlie
sands
asking
him
to
come
up
just
as
i
was
sealing
it
bettina
knocked
and
came
in
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
stood
looking
at
us
both
where
is
miss
tish
she
asked
reading
her
bible
i
said
tartly
when
tish
is
up
to
some
mischief
she
generally
reads
an
extra
chapter
or
two
as
atonement
is
she
is
she
always
like
this
the
trouble
is
explained
aggie
gently
miss
letitia
is
an
enthusiast
whatever
she
does
she
does
with
all
her
heart
i
feel
so
responsible
said
bettina
i
try
to
look
after
her
but
what
can
i
do
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
i
assured
her
let
her
alone
if
she
wants
to
fly
let
her
fly
if
she
wants
to
race
let
her
race
and
trust
in
providence
i
afraid
providence
has
its
hands
full
said
bettina
and
went
to
bed
for
the
remainder
of
that
week
nothing
was
talked
of
in
morris
valley
but
the
approaching
race
some
of
eliza
bailey
friends
gave
parties
for
us
which
aggie
and
i
attended
tish
refused
being
now
openly
at
the
most
of
the
day
morris
valley
was
much
excited
should
it
wear
motor
clothes
or
should
it
follow
the
example
of
the
english
derby
and
the
french
races
and
wear
its
afternoon
reception
dress
with
white
kid
gloves
or
it
being
warm
lingerie
clothes
and
sunshades
be
most
suitable
some
of
the
gossip
i
retailed
to
jasper
and
greasy
in
the
baileys
garage
where
he
was
working
over
his
car
tell
to
wear
mourning
he
said
pessimistically
there
always
a
fatality
or
two
if
there
was
a
fair
chance
of
it
nothing
would
make
sit
for
hours
watching
dusty
streaks
going
by
the
race
was
scheduled
for
wednesday
on
sunday
night
the
cars
began
to
come
in
on
monday
tish
took
us
all
including
bettina
to
the
track
there
were
half
a
dozen
tents
in
the
oval
one
of
them
marked
with
a
huge
red
cross
hospital
tent
said
tish
calmly
we
even
on
permission
from
ellis
went
round
the
track
at
one
spot
tish
stopped
the
car
and
got
out
nail
she
said
briefly
it
been
a
track
for
years
and
we
gathered
a
bushel
of
nails
aggie
and
i
said
nothing
but
we
looked
at
each
other
tish
had
said
we
evidently
cousin
angeline
legacy
was
not
going
into
a
mortgage
the
were
almost
ready
peanut
and
lunch
stands
had
sprung
up
everywhere
the
oval
save
by
the
tents
and
the
repair
pits
was
marked
off
into
numbered
on
tall
banners
groups
of
dirty
men
in
overalls
carrying
machine
wrenches
small
boys
with
buckets
of
water
onlookers
round
the
tents
and
made
the
place
look
busy
and
interesting
some
of
the
excitement
i
confess
got
into
my
blood
tish
on
the
contrary
was
calm
and
businesslike
we
were
sorry
we
had
sent
for
charlie
sands
she
no
longer
went
out
in
car
and
that
evening
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
and
made
a
boiled
salad
dressing
we
were
all
deceived
charlie
sands
came
the
next
morning
he
was
on
the
veranda
reading
a
paper
when
we
got
down
to
breakfast
tish
face
was
a
study
who
sent
for
you
she
demanded
sent
for
me
why
who
would
send
for
me
i
here
to
write
up
the
race
i
thought
if
you
have
been
out
to
the
track
we
go
out
this
morning
we
been
out
said
tish
shortly
and
we
went
in
to
breakfast
once
or
twice
during
the
meal
i
caught
her
eye
on
me
and
on
aggie
and
she
was
short
with
us
both
while
she
was
upstairs
i
had
a
word
with
charlie
sands
well
he
said
what
is
it
this
time
is
she
racing
worse
than
that
i
replied
i
think
she
backing
the
thing
no
with
her
cousin
angeline
legacy
with
that
i
told
him
about
our
meeting
ellis
and
the
whole
story
he
listened
without
a
word
so
that
the
situation
i
finished
he
has
her
hypnotized
charlie
what
more
i
should
be
surprised
to
see
her
enter
the
race
under
an
assumed
name
charlie
sands
looked
at
the
racing
list
in
the
morris
valley
sun
good
cars
all
of
them
he
said
she
not
here
among
the
drivers
unless
she
who
are
these
drivers
anyhow
i
never
heard
of
any
of
them
it
a
small
race
i
suggested
i
dare
say
the
big
men
perhaps
he
put
away
his
paper
and
got
up
i
just
wander
round
the
town
for
an
hour
or
two
aunt
lizzie
he
said
i
believe
there
a
nigger
in
this
woodpile
and
i
a
right
nifty
little
when
he
came
back
about
noon
however
he
looked
puzzled
i
drew
him
aside
it
seems
on
the
level
he
said
it
so
darned
open
it
makes
me
suspicious
but
she
back
of
it
all
right
i
got
her
bank
on
the
we
spent
that
afternoon
at
the
track
with
the
different
cars
doing
what
i
think
they
called
trying
out
heats
it
appeared
that
a
car
to
qualify
must
do
a
certain
distance
in
a
certain
time
it
grew
monotonous
after
a
while
all
but
one
entry
qualified
and
jasper
just
made
it
the
best
showing
was
made
by
the
bonor
car
according
to
charlie
sands
jasper
came
to
our
machine
when
it
was
over
smiling
without
any
particular
good
cheer
i
made
it
and
that
all
he
said
i
got
about
as
much
chance
as
a
watermelon
at
a
colored
picnic
i
being
slaughtered
to
make
a
roman
holiday
if
you
feel
that
way
why
do
you
do
it
demanded
bettina
coldly
if
you
go
in
expecting
to
slaughtered
he
was
leaning
on
the
side
of
the
car
and
looked
up
at
her
with
eyes
that
made
my
heart
ache
they
were
so
wretched
what
does
it
matter
he
said
i
probably
trail
in
at
the
last
sound
in
wind
and
limb
if
i
do
what
does
it
matter
he
turned
and
left
us
at
that
and
i
looked
at
bettina
she
had
her
lips
shut
tight
and
was
blinking
hard
i
wished
that
jasper
had
looked
back
v
charlie
sands
announced
at
dinner
that
he
intended
to
spend
the
night
at
the
track
tish
put
down
her
fork
and
looked
at
him
why
she
demanded
i
going
to
help
the
boy
next
door
watch
his
car
he
said
calmly
nothing
against
your
friend
ellis
aunt
tish
but
some
enemy
of
true
sport
might
take
a
notion
in
the
night
to
slip
a
dope
pill
into
the
mouth
of
friend
jasper
car
and
have
her
go
to
sleep
on
the
track
we
spent
a
quiet
evening
ellis
was
busy
of
course
and
so
was
jasper
the
boy
came
to
the
house
to
get
charlie
sands
and
i
suppose
for
a
word
with
bettina
for
when
he
saw
us
all
on
the
porch
he
looked
as
you
may
say
thwarted
when
charlie
sands
had
gone
up
for
his
pajamas
and
jasper
stood
looking
up
at
us
oh
association
of
chaperons
he
said
is
it
permitted
that
my
lady
walk
to
the
gate
with
me
alone
i
am
not
your
lady
flashed
bettina
you
nothing
to
say
about
that
he
said
recklessly
i
selected
you
you
ca
help
it
i
have
claimed
that
you
have
selected
me
anyhow
i
do
wish
to
go
to
the
gate
said
bettina
he
went
rather
white
at
that
and
charlie
sands
coming
down
at
that
moment
with
a
pair
of
pajamas
under
his
arm
and
a
toothbrush
sticking
out
of
his
breast
pocket
romance
as
jasper
said
later
in
referring
to
it
was
buried
in
sands
jasper
went
up
to
bettina
and
held
out
his
hand
you
wish
me
luck
wo
you
of
course
she
took
his
hand
but
i
think
you
a
bit
of
a
coward
jasper
he
eyed
her
coward
he
said
i
the
bravest
man
you
know
i
doing
a
thing
i
scared
to
death
to
do
the
race
was
to
begin
at
two
in
the
afternoon
there
were
small
races
to
be
run
first
but
the
real
event
was
due
at
three
from
early
in
the
morning
a
procession
of
cars
from
out
of
town
poured
in
past
eliza
bailey
front
porch
and
by
noon
her
cretonne
cushions
were
thick
with
dust
and
not
only
automobiles
came
but
buggies
delivery
carts
anything
and
everything
that
could
transport
the
crowd
at
noon
ellis
telephoned
tish
that
the
was
sold
out
and
that
almost
all
the
that
had
been
reserved
were
taken
charlie
sands
came
home
to
luncheon
with
a
curious
smile
on
his
face
how
are
you
betting
aunt
tish
he
asked
betting
yes
has
ellis
let
you
in
on
the
betting
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
tish
said
sourly
ellis
controls
the
betting
so
that
it
may
be
done
in
an
orderly
manner
i
am
sure
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
like
to
bet
a
little
charlie
aggie
put
in
with
an
eye
on
tish
i
put
all
i
win
on
the
collection
plate
on
sunday
very
well
charlie
sands
took
out
his
notebook
on
what
car
and
how
much
ten
dollars
on
the
fein
it
made
the
best
time
at
the
trial
heats
i
would
if
i
were
you
said
charlie
sands
suppose
we
put
it
on
our
young
friend
next
door
bettina
rather
sniffed
on
jasper
she
exclaimed
on
jasper
said
charlie
sands
gravely
tish
who
had
hardly
heard
us
looked
up
from
her
plate
bettina
is
betting
she
snapped
putting
it
on
the
collection
plate
does
help
any
but
with
that
she
caught
charlie
sands
eye
and
he
winked
at
her
tish
colored
gambling
is
one
thing
clean
sport
is
another
she
said
hotly
i
believe
however
that
whatever
charlie
sands
may
have
suspected
he
really
knew
nothing
until
the
race
had
started
by
that
time
it
was
too
late
to
prevent
it
and
the
only
way
he
could
think
of
to
avoid
getting
tish
involved
in
a
scandal
was
to
let
it
go
on
we
went
to
the
track
in
tish
car
and
parked
in
the
oval
not
near
the
grandstand
however
tish
had
picked
out
for
herself
a
curve
at
one
end
of
the
track
which
ellis
had
said
was
the
worst
bit
on
the
course
he
says
said
tish
as
we
put
the
top
down
and
got
out
the
vacuum
bottle
oh
yes
ellis
had
sent
tish
one
as
a
present
that
if
there
are
any
smashups
they
occur
here
aggie
is
not
a
bloodthirsty
woman
ordinarily
but
her
face
quite
lit
up
not
really
she
said
they
probably
turn
turtle
said
tish
there
is
never
a
race
without
a
fatality
or
two
no
racer
can
get
any
life
insurance
ellis
says
four
men
were
killed
at
the
last
race
he
promoted
then
i
think
ellis
is
a
murderer
bettina
cried
we
all
looked
at
her
she
was
limp
and
white
and
was
leaning
back
among
the
cushions
with
her
eyes
shut
why
did
you
tell
jasper
about
this
curve
she
demanded
of
tish
but
at
that
moment
a
pistol
shot
rang
out
and
the
races
were
on
the
fein
won
two
of
the
three
small
races
jasper
was
entered
only
for
the
big
race
in
the
interval
before
the
race
was
on
jasper
went
round
the
track
slowly
looking
for
bettina
when
he
saw
us
he
waved
but
did
not
stop
he
was
number
thirteen
i
shall
not
describe
the
race
after
the
first
round
or
two
what
with
dust
in
my
eyes
and
my
neck
aching
from
turning
my
head
so
rapidly
i
just
sat
back
and
let
them
spin
in
front
of
me
it
was
after
a
dozen
laps
or
so
with
number
thirteen
doing
as
well
as
any
of
them
that
tish
was
arrested
charlie
sands
came
up
beside
the
car
with
a
gentleman
named
atkins
who
turned
out
to
be
a
county
detective
charlie
sands
was
looking
stern
and
severe
but
the
detective
was
rather
apologetic
this
is
miss
carberry
said
charlie
sands
aunt
tish
this
gentleman
wishes
to
speak
to
you
come
around
after
the
race
tish
observed
calmly
miss
carberry
said
the
detective
gently
i
believe
you
are
back
of
this
race
are
you
what
if
i
am
demanded
tish
charlie
sands
put
a
hand
on
the
detective
arm
it
like
this
aunt
tish
he
said
you
are
accused
of
practicing
a
game
that
all
this
race
is
sewed
up
you
employ
those
with
drivers
at
an
average
of
fifty
dollars
a
week
they
are
hardly
worth
it
aunt
tish
i
could
have
got
you
a
better
string
for
tish
opened
her
mouth
and
shut
it
again
without
speaking
you
also
control
the
betting
privileges
as
you
own
all
the
racers
you
have
probably
known
for
a
couple
of
weeks
who
will
win
the
race
having
made
the
fein
favorite
you
can
bet
on
a
brand
or
a
bonor
or
whatever
one
you
chance
to
like
and
win
out
only
i
take
it
rather
hard
of
you
aunt
tish
not
to
have
let
the
family
in
i
hard
up
as
the
dickens
charlie
sands
said
tish
impressively
if
you
are
joking
joking
did
you
ever
know
a
county
detective
to
arrest
a
prominent
woman
at
a
as
a
little
jest
between
friends
there
no
joke
aunt
tish
you
financed
a
phony
race
the
permit
is
taken
in
your
name
carberry
whatever
car
wins
you
and
ellis
take
the
prize
money
half
the
gate
receipts
and
what
you
have
made
out
of
the
betting
tish
rose
in
the
machine
and
held
out
both
her
hands
to
atkins
officer
perform
your
duty
she
said
solemnly
ignorance
is
no
defense
and
i
know
it
where
are
the
handcuffs
we
not
bother
about
them
miss
carberry
he
said
if
you
like
get
into
the
car
and
you
can
tell
me
all
about
it
while
we
watch
the
race
which
car
is
to
win
i
may
have
been
a
fool
county
detective
she
said
coldly
but
i
not
a
knave
i
have
not
bet
a
dollar
on
the
race
we
were
very
silent
for
a
time
the
detective
seemed
to
enjoy
the
race
very
much
and
ate
peanuts
out
of
his
pocket
he
even
bought
a
pennant
with
morris
valley
races
on
it
and
fastened
it
to
the
car
charlie
sands
however
sat
with
his
arms
folded
stiff
and
severe
once
tish
bent
forward
and
touched
his
arm
you
you
do
think
it
will
get
in
the
papers
do
you
she
quavered
charlie
sands
looked
at
her
with
gloom
i
shall
have
to
send
it
myself
aunt
tish
he
said
it
is
my
duty
to
my
paper
even
my
family
pride
hurt
to
the
quick
and
quivering
as
it
is
must
not
interfere
with
my
duty
it
was
bettina
who
suggested
a
way
out
bettina
who
had
sat
back
as
pale
as
tish
and
heard
that
her
ellis
was
as
charlie
sands
said
later
as
crooked
as
a
pretzel
but
jasper
was
not
not
subsidized
she
said
if
he
wins
it
all
right
is
it
the
county
detective
turned
to
her
jasper
he
said
a
young
man
who
lives
here
bettina
colored
he
is
not
to
be
suspected
certainly
not
said
bettina
haughtily
he
is
above
suspicion
besides
he
he
and
ellis
are
not
friends
well
the
county
detective
was
no
fool
he
saw
the
situation
that
minute
and
smiled
when
he
offered
bettina
a
peanut
of
course
he
said
cheerfully
if
the
race
is
won
by
a
morris
valley
man
and
not
by
one
of
the
ellis
cars
i
do
suppose
the
district
attorney
would
care
to
do
anything
about
it
in
fact
he
said
smiling
at
bettina
i
know
that
i
put
it
up
to
the
district
attorney
at
all
a
warning
to
ellis
would
get
him
out
of
the
state
it
was
just
at
that
moment
that
car
number
thirteen
coming
round
the
curve
skidded
into
the
field
threw
out
both
jasper
mccutcheon
and
his
mechanician
and
after
standing
on
two
wheels
for
an
appreciable
moment
of
time
righted
herself
panting
with
her
nose
against
a
post
jasper
sat
up
almost
immediately
and
caught
at
his
shoulder
the
mechanician
was
stunned
he
got
up
took
a
step
or
two
and
fell
down
weak
with
fright
i
do
not
recall
very
distinctly
what
happened
next
we
got
out
of
the
machine
i
remember
and
bettina
was
cutting
off
jasper
sweater
with
charlie
sands
penknife
and
crying
as
she
did
it
and
charlie
sands
was
trying
to
prevent
jasper
from
getting
back
into
his
car
while
jasper
was
protesting
that
he
could
win
in
two
or
more
laps
and
that
he
could
drive
with
one
hand
he
only
broken
his
arm
the
crowd
had
gathered
round
us
thick
suddenly
they
drew
back
and
in
a
sort
of
haze
i
saw
tish
in
jasper
car
with
aggie
as
white
as
death
holding
to
tish
sleeve
and
begging
her
not
to
get
in
the
next
moment
tish
let
in
the
clutch
of
the
racer
and
aggie
took
a
sort
of
flying
leap
and
landed
beside
her
in
the
mechanician
seat
charlie
sands
saw
it
when
i
did
but
we
were
both
too
late
tish
was
crossing
the
ditch
into
the
track
again
and
the
moment
she
struck
level
ground
she
put
up
the
gasoline
it
was
just
then
that
aggie
fell
out
landing
as
i
have
said
before
in
a
pile
of
sand
tish
said
afterward
that
she
never
missed
her
she
had
just
discovered
that
this
was
not
jasper
old
car
which
she
knew
something
about
but
a
new
racer
with
the
old
hood
and
seat
put
on
in
order
to
fool
ellis
she
did
know
a
thing
about
it
well
you
know
the
rest
how
tish
trying
to
find
how
the
gears
worked
the
bonor
car
and
threw
it
off
the
field
and
out
of
the
race
how
with
the
grandstand
going
crazy
she
skidded
off
the
track
into
the
field
turned
completely
round
twice
and
found
herself
on
the
track
again
facing
the
way
she
wanted
to
go
how
at
the
last
lap
she
threw
a
tire
and
without
cutting
down
her
speed
bumped
home
the
winner
with
the
end
of
her
tongue
nearly
bitten
off
and
her
spine
fairly
driven
up
into
her
skull
illustration
without
cutting
down
her
speed
bumped
home
the
winner
all
this
is
well
known
now
as
is
also
the
fact
that
ellis
disappeared
from
the
judges
stand
after
a
word
or
two
with
atkins
and
was
never
seen
at
morris
valley
again
tish
came
out
of
the
race
ahead
by
half
the
gate
money
six
thousand
dollars
by
a
thousand
dollars
from
concessions
and
a
lame
back
that
she
kept
all
winter
even
deducting
the
hundred
she
had
put
up
she
was
hundred
dollars
ahead
not
counting
the
prize
money
charlie
sand
brought
the
money
from
the
track
that
night
after
having
paid
off
ellis
and
given
atkins
a
small
present
he
took
over
the
prize
money
to
jasper
and
came
back
with
it
jasper
maintaining
that
it
belonged
to
tish
and
that
he
had
only
raced
for
the
honor
of
morris
valley
for
some
time
the
money
went
begging
but
it
settled
itself
naturally
enough
tish
giving
it
to
jasper
in
the
event
of
but
that
came
later
on
the
following
evening
bettina
in
the
pursuit
of
learning
to
cook
having
baked
a
chocolate
cake
we
saw
jasper
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
crossing
the
side
lawn
jasper
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
i
see
a
chocolate
cake
cooling
on
the
kitchen
porch
he
said
did
you
order
it
miss
lizzie
i
shook
my
head
miss
tish
miss
aggie
i
ordered
it
said
bettina
defiantly
or
rather
i
baked
it
and
you
did
that
knowing
what
it
entailed
he
was
coming
up
the
steps
slowly
and
with
care
what
does
it
entail
demanded
bettina
me
oh
that
said
bettina
i
knew
that
jasper
threw
his
head
back
and
laughed
then
will
the
associated
chaperons
he
said
turn
their
backs
not
at
all
i
began
stiffly
if
i
she
baked
it
herself
said
jasper
exultantly
one
two
when
i
say
three
i
shall
kiss
bettina
and
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
he
carried
out
his
threat
eliza
bailey
forwarded
me
this
letter
from
london
where
bettina
had
sent
it
to
her
i
hope
you
are
coming
home
soon
i
really
think
you
should
aunt
lizzie
is
here
and
she
brought
two
friends
and
mother
i
feel
so
responsible
for
them
aunt
lizzie
is
sane
enough
if
somewhat
cranky
but
miss
tish
is
almost
more
than
i
can
manage
i
never
know
what
she
is
going
to
do
next
and
i
am
worn
out
with
chaperoning
her
and
miss
aggie
although
she
is
very
sweet
is
always
smoking
cubeb
cigarettes
for
hay
fever
and
it
looks
terrible
the
neighbors
do
not
know
they
are
cubeb
and
anyhow
that
a
habit
mother
and
yesterday
miss
tish
was
arrested
and
ran
a
motor
race
and
won
it
and
she
is
knitting
a
stocking
and
reciting
the
psalm
please
mother
i
think
you
should
come
home
lovingly
bettina
i
think
i
shall
marry
jasper
after
all
he
says
he
likes
the
presbyterian
service
i
looked
up
from
reading
eliza
letter
tish
was
knitting
quietly
and
planning
to
give
the
money
back
to
the
town
in
the
shape
of
a
library
and
aggie
was
holding
a
cubeb
cigarette
to
her
nose
down
on
the
tennis
court
jasper
and
bettina
were
idly
batting
a
ball
round
i
glad
the
ellis
man
did
not
get
her
said
aggie
and
then
after
a
sneeze
how
jasper
reminds
me
of
mr
wiggins
the
library
did
not
get
the
money
after
all
tish
sent
it
as
a
wedding
present
to
bettina
like
a
wolf
on
the
fold
i
aggie
has
always
been
in
the
habit
of
observing
the
anniversary
of
wiggins
death
aggie
has
the
anniversary
habit
anyhow
and
her
life
is
a
succession
of
small
on
which
she
wears
mental
crape
or
wedding
garments
depending
on
the
occasion
tish
and
i
always
remember
these
occasions
appropriately
sending
flowers
on
the
anniversaries
of
the
passing
away
of
aggie
parents
grandparents
a
niece
who
died
in
birth
her
cousin
sarah
webb
who
married
a
missionary
and
was
swallowed
whole
by
a
large
snake
except
her
shoes
which
the
reptile
refused
and
of
which
aggie
possesses
the
right
given
her
by
the
stricken
husband
and
of
course
wiggins
for
wiggins
tish
and
i
generally
send
the
same
things
each
year
tish
a
wreath
of
autumn
foliage
and
i
a
sheaf
of
wheat
tied
with
a
lavender
ribbon
the
program
seldom
varies
we
drive
to
the
cemetery
in
the
afternoon
and
aggie
places
the
sheaf
and
the
wreath
on
last
after
first
removing
the
lavender
ribbon
of
which
she
makes
cap
bows
through
the
year
and
an
occasional
or
bag
then
home
to
chicken
and
waffles
which
had
been
wiggins
favorite
meal
in
the
evening
charlie
sands
generally
comes
in
and
we
play
a
rubber
or
two
of
bridge
on
the
thirtieth
anniversary
of
wiggins
falling
off
a
roof
and
breaking
his
neck
tish
was
late
in
arriving
and
i
found
aggie
sitting
alone
dressed
in
black
with
a
bundle
in
her
lap
i
put
my
sheaf
on
the
table
and
untied
my
where
tish
i
asked
not
here
yet
something
in
aggie
tone
made
me
look
at
her
she
was
eyeing
the
bundle
in
her
lap
i
got
a
paler
shade
of
ribbon
this
time
i
said
seeing
she
made
no
comment
on
the
sheaf
it
a
better
color
for
me
if
you
going
to
make
my
christmas
present
out
of
it
this
year
again
where
wreath
here
aggie
pointed
dispiritedly
to
the
bundle
in
her
lap
and
went
on
rocking
that
that
no
wreath
in
reply
aggie
lifted
the
tissue
paper
and
shook
out
with
hands
that
trembled
with
indignation
a
centerpiece
she
held
it
up
before
me
and
we
eyed
each
other
over
it
both
of
us
understood
tish
is
changed
lizzie
aggie
said
hollowly
ask
her
for
bread
these
days
and
she
gives
you
a
fandangle
on
mother
anniversary
she
sent
me
a
set
of
doilies
and
when
charlie
sands
was
in
the
hospital
with
appendicitis
she
took
him
a
pair
of
pillow
shams
it
that
syrian
both
of
us
knew
we
had
seen
tish
apartment
change
from
a
sedate
and
spinsterly
retreat
to
a
riot
of
lace
covers
on
the
mantel
on
the
backs
of
chairs
on
the
stands
on
the
pillows
everywhere
we
had
watched
her
marseilles
bedspreads
give
way
to
covers
with
bolsters
to
match
we
had
seen
tish
go
through
a
cold
winter
clad
in
a
succession
of
sleazy
silk
kimonos
instead
of
her
flannel
terrible
kimonos
green
and
yellow
and
red
and
pink
that
looked
like
fruit
salads
and
were
just
as
heating
it
that
dratted
syrian
cried
aggie
and
at
that
tish
came
in
she
stood
inside
the
door
and
eyed
us
what
about
him
she
demanded
if
i
choose
to
take
a
poor
starving
christian
youth
and
assist
him
by
buying
from
him
what
i
need
what
i
need
that
my
affair
is
it
tufik
was
starving
and
i
took
him
in
he
took
you
in
all
right
aggie
sniffed
a
great
mustached
dirty
palavering
foreigner
who
probably
got
a
harem
at
home
and
no
respect
for
women
tish
glanced
at
my
sheaf
and
at
the
centerpiece
she
was
dressed
as
she
always
dressed
on
wiggins
day
in
black
but
she
had
a
new
lace
collar
with
a
jabot
and
we
knew
where
she
had
got
it
she
saw
our
eyes
on
it
and
she
had
the
grace
to
flush
once
for
all
she
snapped
i
intend
to
look
after
this
unfortunate
syrian
if
my
friends
object
i
shall
be
deeply
sorry
but
so
far
as
i
care
they
may
object
until
they
are
purple
in
the
face
and
their
tongues
hang
out
i
been
sending
my
money
to
foreign
missions
long
enough
i
doing
my
missionary
work
at
home
now
he
marry
you
this
from
aggie
tish
ignored
her
his
father
is
an
honored
citizen
of
beirut
of
the
nobility
the
family
is
impoverished
being
christian
and
grossly
imposed
on
by
the
turks
tufik
speaks
french
and
english
as
well
as
mohammedan
they
offered
him
a
high
government
position
if
he
would
desert
the
christian
faith
but
he
refused
firmly
he
came
to
this
country
for
religious
freedom
at
any
moment
they
may
come
after
him
and
take
him
back
a
glint
of
hope
came
to
me
i
made
a
mental
note
to
write
to
the
mayor
or
whatever
they
call
him
over
there
and
tell
him
where
he
could
locate
his
wandering
boy
he
loves
the
god
of
america
said
tish
money
aggie
jeered
and
he
is
so
pathetic
so
grateful
i
told
hannah
at
noon
what
delayed
me
to
give
him
his
lunch
he
was
starving
i
thought
never
fill
him
and
when
it
was
over
he
stooped
in
the
sweetest
way
while
she
was
gathering
up
the
empty
dishes
and
kissed
her
hand
it
was
touching
very
i
said
dryly
what
did
hannah
do
she
a
fool
she
broke
a
cup
on
his
head
wiggins
anniversary
was
not
a
success
part
of
this
was
due
to
tish
who
talked
of
tufik
steadily
of
his
youth
of
the
wonderful
bargains
she
secured
from
him
of
his
belief
that
this
was
the
land
of
opportunity
aggie
sniffed
of
his
familiarity
with
the
bible
and
biblical
places
of
the
search
the
turks
were
making
for
him
the
atmosphere
was
not
cleared
by
aggie
taking
the
centerpiece
to
the
cemetery
and
placing
it
with
my
sheaf
on
wiggins
grave
as
we
got
into
tish
machine
to
go
back
aggie
was
undeniably
peevish
she
caught
cold
too
and
was
sneezing
as
she
always
does
when
she
is
irritated
or
excited
where
to
asked
tish
from
the
looking
straight
ahead
and
pulling
on
her
gloves
from
where
we
sat
we
could
still
see
the
dot
of
white
on
the
grass
that
was
the
centerpiece
back
to
the
house
aggie
snapped
to
have
some
chicken
and
waffles
and
tufik
for
dinner
tish
drove
home
in
cold
silence
as
well
as
we
could
tell
from
her
back
she
was
not
so
much
indignant
as
she
was
determined
thus
we
do
not
believe
that
she
willfully
drove
over
every
rut
and
on
the
road
scattering
us
generously
over
the
tonneau
and
finally
when
aggie
who
was
the
lighter
was
tossed
against
the
top
and
sprained
her
neck
eliciting
a
protest
from
us
she
replied
in
an
abstracted
tone
which
showed
where
her
mind
was
it
would
be
rougher
on
a
camel
she
said
absently
tufik
was
telling
me
the
other
day
aggie
had
got
her
head
straight
by
that
time
and
was
holding
it
with
both
hands
to
avoid
jarring
she
looked
goaded
and
desperate
and
as
she
said
afterward
the
thing
slipped
out
before
she
knew
she
was
more
than
thinking
it
oh
damn
tufik
she
said
fortunately
at
that
moment
we
blew
out
a
tire
and
apparently
tish
did
not
hear
her
while
i
was
jacking
up
the
car
and
tish
was
getting
the
key
of
the
toolbox
out
of
her
stocking
aggie
sat
sullenly
in
her
place
and
watched
us
i
suppose
she
gibed
a
camel
never
blows
out
a
tire
it
might
tish
said
grimly
if
it
heard
an
oath
from
the
lips
of
a
teacher
we
ate
wiggins
anniversary
dinner
without
any
great
hilarity
aggie
neck
was
very
stiff
and
she
had
turned
in
the
collar
of
her
dress
and
wrapped
flannels
wrung
out
of
lamp
oil
round
it
when
she
wished
to
address
either
tish
or
myself
she
held
her
head
rigid
and
turned
her
whole
body
in
her
chair
and
when
she
felt
a
sneeze
coming
on
she
clutched
wildly
at
her
head
with
both
hands
as
if
she
expected
it
to
fly
off
tufik
was
not
mentioned
though
twice
tish
got
as
far
as
tu
and
then
thought
better
of
it
but
her
mind
was
on
him
and
we
knew
it
she
worked
the
conversation
round
to
bible
history
and
triumphantly
demanded
whether
we
knew
that
sodom
and
gomorrah
are
towns
and
that
a
line
is
contemplated
to
them
from
some
place
or
other
it
developed
later
that
she
meant
tyre
and
sidon
once
she
suggested
that
aggie
sideboard
needed
new
linens
but
after
a
look
at
aggie
rigid
head
she
let
it
go
at
that
no
one
was
sorry
when
with
dinner
almost
over
and
aggie
lifting
her
spoon
straight
up
in
front
of
her
and
opening
her
mouth
with
a
sort
of
lockjaw
movement
the
bell
rang
we
thought
it
was
charlie
sands
it
was
not
aggie
faced
the
doorway
and
i
saw
her
eyes
widen
tish
and
i
turned
a
boy
stood
in
the
doorway
a
shrinking
timid
young
oriental
very
dark
of
skin
very
white
of
teeth
very
black
of
hair
a
slim
youth
of
eighteen
possibly
twenty
in
a
shabby
blue
suit
broken
shoes
and
a
celluloid
collar
twisting
between
nervous
brown
fingers
not
as
clean
as
they
might
have
been
was
a
package
my
friends
he
said
and
smiled
tish
is
an
extraordinary
woman
she
did
not
say
a
word
she
sat
still
and
let
the
smile
get
in
its
work
its
first
effect
was
on
aggie
neck
which
she
forgot
tufik
timid
eyes
rested
for
a
moment
on
tish
and
brightened
then
like
a
benediction
they
turned
to
mine
and
came
to
a
stop
on
aggie
he
took
a
step
farther
into
the
room
my
friend
friend
are
my
friend
he
said
america
is
my
friend
this
so
great
god
country
aggie
put
down
her
spoon
and
closed
her
mouth
which
had
been
open
come
in
tufik
said
tish
and
i
am
sure
miss
pilkington
would
like
you
to
sit
down
tufik
still
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
aggie
twisting
his
package
my
friend
has
said
he
observed
he
was
quite
calm
and
divinely
trustful
my
friend
has
said
that
this
is
for
miss
pilk
a
sad
day
my
friend
is
my
mother
i
have
but
her
and
god
unless
but
perhaps
i
have
two
new
friend
also
no
of
course
we
are
your
friends
said
aggie
feeling
for
the
with
her
foot
we
are
are
we
lizzie
tufik
turned
and
looked
at
me
wistfully
it
came
over
me
then
what
an
awful
thing
it
must
be
to
be
so
far
from
home
and
knowing
nobody
and
having
to
wear
trousers
and
celluloid
collars
instead
of
robes
and
turbans
and
eat
potatoes
and
fried
things
instead
of
olives
and
figs
and
dates
and
to
be
in
danger
of
being
taken
back
and
made
into
a
mohammedan
and
having
to
keep
a
harem
certainly
i
assented
if
you
are
good
we
will
be
your
friends
he
flashed
a
boyish
smile
at
me
i
am
good
he
said
calmly
as
the
angels
i
am
good
i
have
here
a
letter
from
a
priest
i
give
it
to
you
read
he
got
a
very
dirty
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
brought
it
round
the
table
to
me
see
he
said
the
priest
says
all
my
children
tufik
lies
next
my
heart
he
held
the
letter
out
to
me
but
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
copied
from
an
egyptian
monument
and
was
about
as
legible
as
an
outbreak
of
measles
this
he
said
gently
pointing
is
the
priest
blessing
i
carry
it
ever
it
brings
me
friends
he
put
the
paper
away
and
drew
a
long
breath
then
surveyed
us
all
with
shining
eyes
it
has
brought
me
you
we
were
rather
overwhelmed
aggie
maid
having
responded
to
the
bell
aggie
ordered
ice
cream
for
tufik
and
a
chair
drawn
to
the
table
but
the
chair
tufik
refused
with
a
little
smiling
bow
it
is
not
right
that
i
sit
he
said
i
stand
in
the
presence
of
my
three
mothers
but
first
i
forget
my
gift
for
the
sadness
miss
pilk
he
held
out
the
package
and
aggie
opened
it
tufik
gift
proved
to
be
a
small
linen
doily
with
a
border
we
were
gone
from
that
moment
i
know
it
now
looking
back
gone
we
were
lost
the
moment
tufik
stood
in
the
doorway
smiling
and
bowing
tish
saw
us
going
and
with
the
calmness
of
the
lost
sat
there
nibbling
cake
and
watching
us
through
her
spectacles
and
raised
not
a
hand
aggie
looked
at
the
doily
and
tufik
looked
at
her
that
that
really
very
nice
of
you
said
aggie
i
thank
you
tufik
came
over
and
stood
beside
her
i
give
with
my
heart
he
said
shyly
i
have
had
nobody
in
all
so
large
this
country
nobody
and
now
i
have
you
aggie
saw
but
too
late
he
bent
over
and
touched
his
lips
to
her
hands
the
bible
says
him
that
overcometh
i
will
give
the
morning
star
i
have
overcometh
ah
so
much
the
sea
the
cold
wet
england
the
ellis
island
the
hunger
the
aching
of
one
who
has
no
love
no
money
and
now
i
have
the
morning
star
he
looked
at
us
all
three
at
once
charlie
sands
said
this
was
impossible
until
he
met
tufik
aggie
was
fairly
palpitant
and
tish
was
smug
positively
smug
as
for
me
i
roused
with
a
start
to
find
myself
sugaring
my
ice
cream
charlie
sands
was
delayed
that
night
he
came
in
about
nine
and
found
tufik
telling
us
about
his
home
and
his
people
and
the
shepherds
on
the
hills
about
damascus
and
the
olive
trees
in
sunlight
we
tufik
to
adopt
charlie
sands
as
a
father
but
he
contented
himself
with
a
low
oriental
salute
and
shortly
after
he
bowed
himself
away
charlie
sands
stood
looking
after
him
and
smiling
to
himself
pretty
smooth
boy
that
he
said
smooth
nothing
tish
snapped
getting
the
bridge
score
he
a
and
lonely
boy
and
we
are
going
to
do
the
kindest
thing
we
are
going
to
help
him
to
help
himself
oh
he
help
himself
all
right
observed
charlie
sands
but
since
his
people
are
christians
i
wish
you
tell
me
how
he
knows
so
much
about
the
inside
of
a
harem
seeing
that
comment
annoyed
us
he
ceased
and
we
fell
to
our
bridge
game
but
more
than
once
his
eye
fell
on
aggie
doily
and
he
muttered
something
about
the
assyrian
coming
down
like
a
wolf
on
the
fold
ii
the
problem
of
tufik
future
was
a
pressing
one
tish
called
a
meeting
of
the
three
of
us
next
morning
and
we
met
at
her
house
we
found
her
reading
about
syria
in
the
encyclopædia
while
spread
round
her
on
chairs
and
tables
were
numbers
of
silk
kimonos
rolls
of
crocheted
lace
patterns
and
embroidered
linens
hannah
let
us
in
she
looked
surly
and
had
a
bandage
round
her
head
a
sure
sign
of
trouble
hannah
always
referring
a
pain
in
her
temper
to
her
ear
or
her
head
or
her
teeth
she
clutched
my
arm
in
the
hall
and
held
me
back
i
going
to
poison
him
she
said
miss
lizzie
that
little
snake
goes
or
i
go
i
ashamed
of
you
hannah
i
replied
sternly
if
out
of
the
breadth
of
her
charity
miss
tish
wishes
to
assist
a
fellow
man
hannah
reeled
back
and
freed
my
arm
my
god
she
whispered
you
too
i
am
very
fond
of
hannah
who
has
lived
with
tish
for
many
years
but
i
had
small
patience
with
her
that
morning
i
can
not
see
how
it
concerns
you
anyhow
hannah
i
observed
severely
hannah
put
her
apron
to
her
eyes
and
sniffled
into
it
oh
you
ca
ca
you
she
wailed
do
i
give
him
half
his
meals
with
him
miss
tish
till

that
lingo
of
his
so

for
a
cup
of
coffee
or

me
i
patted
hannah
on
the
arm

of
the
exaltation
of
a
good
deed

hannah
as
it
sustained
us

are
going
to

hannah
i
said

himself
be
gentle
with
him
remember
he
comes
from
the
land
of
the
bible
humph
said
hannah
who
reads
the
newspapers
so
does
the
plague
the
problem
we
had
set
ourselves
we
worked
out
that
morning
as
tish
said
the
boy
ought
to
have
light
work
for
the
syrians
are
not
a
laboring
people
their
occupation
is
er
mainly
pastoral
she
said
with
the
authority
of
the
encyclopædia
grazing
their
herds
and
gathering
figs
and
olives
if
we
knew
some
one
who
needed
a
shepherd
aggie
opposed
the
shepherd
idea
however
as
she
said
and
with
reason
the
climate
is
too
rigorous
it
all
well
enough
in
syria
she
said
where
they
have
no
cold
weather
but
he
take
his
death
of
pneumonia
here
we
put
the
shepherd
idea
reluctantly
aside
my
own
notion
of
finding
a
camel
for
him
to
look
after
was
negatived
by
tish
at
once
and
properly
enough
i
realized
the
only
camels
are
in
circuses
she
said
and
our
duty
to
the
boy
is
moral
as
well
as
physical
circuses
are
dens
of
immorality
of
course
the
syrians
are
merchants
and
we
might
get
him
work
in
a
store
but
then
again
what
chance
has
he
of
rising
once
a
clerk
always
a
clerk
she
looked
round
at
the
chairs
and
tables
littered
with
the
contents
of
tufik
pasteboard
suitcase
which
lay
empty
at
her
feet
and
there
is
nothing
to
canvassing
from
door
to
door
look
at
these
exquisite
things
and
he
can
not
sell
them
nobody
buys
he
says
he
never
gets
inside
a
house
door
if
you
had
seen
his
face
when
i
bought
a
kimono
from
him
at
eleven
having
found
nothing
in
the
help
wanted
column
to
fit
tufik
case
tish
called
up
charlie
sands
and
offered
tufik
as
a
reporter
provided
he
was
given
no
nightwork
but
charlie
sands
said
it
was
impossible
that
the
editors
and
owners
of
the
paper
were
always
putting
on
their
sons
and
relatives
and
that
when
there
was
a
vacancy
the
big
advertisers
got
it
tish
insisted
she
suggested
that
tufik
could
run
an
arabian
column
like
the
german
one
and
bring
in
a
lot
of
new
subscribers
but
charlie
sands
stood
firm
at
noon
tufik
came
we
heard
a
skirmish
at
the
door
and
hannah
talking
between
her
teeth
she
out
she
said
well
i
think
she
is
not
out
in
tufik
soft
tones
you
not
get
in
ah
but
my
toes
are
in
see
my
foot
wishes
to
enter
then
something
soft
coaxing
infinitely
wistful
in
arabian
followed
by
a
slap
the
next
moment
hannah
in
tears
rushed
back
to
the
kitchen
there
was
no
sound
from
the
hallway
no
smiling
tufik
presented
himself
in
the
doorway
tish
rose
in
the
majesty
of
wrath
i
could
strangle
that
woman
she
said
and
we
followed
her
into
the
hall
tufik
was
standing
inside
the
door
with
his
arms
folded
staring
ahead
he
took
no
notice
of
us
tufik
aggie
cried
running
to
him
did
she
did
she
dare
tish
look
at
his
cheek
she
is
a
bad
woman
tufik
said
somberly
i
make
my
little
prayer
to
see
miss
tish
my
mother
and
she
i
kill
her
we
had
a
hard
time
apologizing
to
him
for
hanna
tish
got
a
basin
of
cold
water
so
he
might
bathe
his
face
and
aggie
brought
a
tablespoonful
of
blackberry
cordial
which
is
soothing
when
the
poor
boy
was
calmer
we
met
in
tish
bedroom
and
tish
was
quite
firm
on
one
point
hannah
must
leave
now
this
i
must
say
in
my
own
defense
i
was
sorry
for
tufik
and
it
is
quite
true
i
bought
him
a
suit
and
winter
flannels
and
a
pair
of
yellow
shoes
he
asked
for
yellow
he
said
he
was
homesick
for
a
bit
of
sunshine
and
our
so
somber
garb
made
him
but
i
would
never
have
dismissed
a
cook
like
hannah
for
him
i
shall
have
to
let
her
go
tish
said
he
is
oriental
and
passionate
he
has
said
he
will
kill
her
and
he
do
it
they
hold
life
very
lightly
humph
i
said
very
well
tish
that
holding
life
lightly
is
a
christian
trait
it
mohammedan
every
mohammedan
wants
to
die
and
go
to
his
heaven
which
is
a
sort
of
sublimated
harem
the
boy
probably
a
christian
by
training
but
he
a
mohammedan
by
blood
aggie
thought
my
remark
immoral
and
said
so
and
just
then
hannah
solved
her
own
problem
by
stalking
into
the
room
with
her
things
on
and
a
suitcase
in
her
hand
i
leaving
miss
tish
she
said
with
her
red
god
knows
i
never
expected
to
be
put
out
of
this
place
by
a
dirty
dago
you
find
your
woolen
stockings
on
the
stretchers
and
you
got
an
appointment
with
the
dentist
tomorrow
morning
at
ten
and
when
that
little
blackguard
has
sucked
you
dry
and
you
want
him
killed
to
get
rid
of
him
you
find
me
at
my
sister
she
picked
up
her
suitcase
and
tish
flung
open
the
door
you
a
woman
hannah
mackintyre
tish
snapped
your
sister
keep
you
you
have
to
work
hannah
turned
in
the
doorway
and
sneered
at
the
three
of
us
oh
no
she
said
i
going
to
hunt
up
three
old
maids
and
learn
to
kiss
their
hands
and
tell
i
have
nobody
but
them
and
god
she
slammed
out
at
that
leaving
us
in
a
state
of
natural
irritation
but
our
rage
soon
faded
tufik
was
not
in
the
parlor
and
tish
tiptoeing
back
reported
that
he
was
in
the
kitchen
and
was
mixing
up
something
in
a
bowl
he
a
dear
boy
she
said
he
feels
responsible
for
hannah
leaving
and
he
getting
luncheon
hannah
is
a
wicked
and
uncharitable
woman
man
inhumanity
to
man
makes
countless
thousands
mourn
quoted
aggie
softly
from
the
kitchen
came
the
rhythmic
beating
of
a
wooden
spoon
against
the
side
of
a
bowl
a
melancholy
chant
quite
archaic
as
tish
said
kept
time
with
the
spoon
and
later
a
smell
of
baking
flour
and
the
clatter
of
dishes
told
us
that
our
meal
was
progressing
syrians
read
tish
out
of
her
book
a
peaceful
and
pastoral
people
they
have
not
changed
materially
in
nineteen
centuries
and
the
traveler
in
their
country
finds
still
the
life
of
biblical
times
something
burning
shortly
after
tufik
beaming
with
happiness
and
hannah
clearly
forgotten
summoned
us
to
the
tufik
was
not
a
cook
we
realized
that
at
once
he
had
made
coffee
in
the
oriental
way
strong
enough
to
float
an
egg
very
sweet
and
full
of
grounds
and
after
a
bite
of
the
cakes
he
had
made
tish
remembered
the
dentist
the
next
day
and
refused
solid
food
on
account
of
a
bad
tooth
the
cakes
were
made
of
lard
and
flour
without
any
or
flavoring
and
the
tops
were
sprinkled
thick
with
granulated
sugar
little
circles
of
grease
melted
out
of
them
on
to
the
plate
and
tufik
with
triumph
sweetly
wistful
over
tish
tooth
humble
and
joyous
in
one
minute
stood
by
the
cake
plate
and
fed
them
to
us
i
caught
aggie
agonized
eye
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
were
we
not
his
friends
and
had
he
not
made
this
delicacy
for
us
on
her
third
cake
however
aggie
luckily
turned
blue
round
the
mouth
and
had
to
go
and
lie
down
this
broke
up
the
meal
and
probably
saved
my
life
though
my
stomach
has
never
been
the
same
since
tish
says
the
cakes
are
probably
all
right
in
the
orient
where
it
is
hot
and
the
grease
does
not
get
a
chance
to
solidify
she
thinks
that
tufik
is
probably
a
good
cook
in
his
own
country
but
aggie
says
that
a
good
many
things
in
the
bible
that
she
never
understood
are
made
plain
to
her
if
that
is
what
they
ate
in
biblical
times
some
of
the
things
they
saw
in
visions
and
all
that
she
dropped
asleep
on
tish
lounge
and
distinctly
saw
tufik
murdering
hannah
by
forcing
one
of
his
cakes
down
her
throat
the
next
month
was
one
of
real
effort
we
had
planned
to
go
to
panama
and
had
our
passage
engaged
but
when
we
broke
the
news
to
tufik
he
turned
quite
pale
you
go
away
he
said
wistfully
only
for
a
month
tish
hastened
to
apologize
you
see
we
we
are
all
very
tired
and
the
panama
canal
canal
i
know
not
a
canal
it
is
for
ships
you
go
there
in
a
ship
yes
a
canal
is
a
you
go
far
in
a
ship
and
i
i
stay
here
only
for
a
month
aggie
broke
in
we
will
leave
you
enough
money
to
live
on
and
perhaps
when
we
come
back
you
will
have
found
something
to
do
for
a
month
he
said
brokenly
i
have
no
friends
no
miss
tish
no
miss
liz
no
miss
pilk
i
die
he
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
it
was
aggie
who
realized
the
awful
truth
the
poor
lonely
boy
was
weeping
and
charlie
sands
may
say
what
he
likes
he
was
really
crying
when
he
turned
there
were
large
tears
on
his
cheeks
what
made
it
worse
was
that
he
was
trying
to
smile
i
wish
you
much
happiness
on
the
canal
he
said
i
am
wicked
but
my
sad
heart
it
ache
that
my
friends
leave
me
i
am
sad
if
only
my
seester
that
was
the
first
we
had
known
of
tufik
sister
back
in
beirut
wearing
a
veil
over
her
face
and
making
lace
for
the
bazaars
we
were
to
know
more
well
between
getting
ready
to
go
to
panama
and
trying
to
find
something
tufik
could
do
we
were
very
busy
for
the
next
month
tufik
grew
reconciled
to
our
going
but
he
was
never
cheerful
about
it
and
finding
that
it
pained
him
we
never
spoke
about
it
in
his
presence
he
was
with
us
a
great
deal
in
the
morning
he
would
go
to
tish
who
would
give
him
a
list
of
her
friends
to
see
then
tish
would
telephone
and
make
appointments
for
him
and
he
would
start
off
hopefully
with
his
pasteboard
suitcase
but
he
never
sold
anything
except
a
pattern
to
ostermaier
the
minister
wife
we
took
day
about
giving
him
his
carfare
but
this
was
pauperizing
and
we
knew
it
besides
he
was
very
sensitive
and
insisted
on
putting
down
everything
we
gave
him
in
a
book
to
be
repaid
later
when
he
had
made
a
success
the
allowance
idea
was
mine
and
it
worked
well
we
figured
that
allowing
for
his
washing
which
was
not
much
as
he
seemed
to
prefer
the
celluloid
collar
he
could
live
in
a
sort
of
way
on
nine
dollars
a
week
we
subscribed
equally
to
this
and
to
save
his
pride
we
mailed
it
to
him
weekly
by
check
his
failure
to
sell
his
things
hurt
him
to
the
soul
more
than
once
we
caught
tears
in
his
eyes
and
he
was
not
well
he
could
not
walk
any
distance
at
all
and
he
coughed
at
last
tish
got
charlie
sands
to
take
him
to
a
lung
specialist
a
stupid
person
who
said
it
was
a
cigarette
cough
this
was
absurd
as
tufik
did
not
smoke
at
last
the
time
came
for
the
panama
trip
tish
called
me
up
the
day
she
packed
and
asked
me
to
come
over
i
ca
i
busy
tish
i
said
she
was
quite
disagreeable
this
is
your
burden
as
well
as
mine
she
snapped
come
over
and
talk
to
that
wretched
boy
while
i
pack
my
trunk
he
stands
and
watches
everything
i
put
in
and
i
have
been
able
to
pack
a
lot
of
things
i
need
i
went
over
that
afternoon
and
found
tufik
huddled
on
the
top
step
of
the
stairs
outside
tish
apartment
with
his
head
in
his
hands
she
has
put
me
out
he
said
looking
up
at
me
with
tragic
eyes
my
mother
has
put
me
out
she
does
not
love
tufik
no
one
loves
tufik
i
am
no
good
i
am
a
dirty
dago
i
was
really
shocked
i
rang
the
bell
and
tish
let
me
in
she
had
had
no
maid
since
hannah
departure
and
was
taking
her
meals
out
she
saw
tufik
and
stiffened
i
thought
i
sent
you
away
she
said
glaring
at
him
he
looked
at
her
pitifully
where
must
i
go
he
asked
and
coughed
tish
sighed
and
flung
the
door
wide
open
bring
him
in
she
said
with
resignation
but
for
heaven
sake
lock
him
in
a
closet
until
i
get
my
underwear
packed
and
if
he
weeps
slap
him
the
poor
boy
was
very
repentant
and
seeing
that
his
cough
worried
us
he
fought
it
back
bravely
i
mixed
the
white
of
an
egg
with
lemon
juice
and
sugar
and
gave
it
to
him
he
was
pathetically
grateful
and
kissed
my
hand
at
five
we
sent
him
away
firmly
having
given
him
dollars
he
presented
each
of
us
with
a
roll
of
crocheted
lace
to
take
with
us
and
turned
in
the
doorway
to
wave
a
wistful
final
we
met
at
tish
that
night
so
that
we
might
all
go
together
to
the
train
charlie
sands
had
agreed
to
see
us
off
and
to
keep
an
eye
on
tufik
during
our
absence
aggie
was
in
a
palpitating
travel
ecstasy
clutching
a
patent
seasick
remedy
and
a
map
of
the
canal
zone
tish
was
seeing
that
the
janitor
shut
off
the
gas
and
water
in
the
apartment
and
charlie
sands
was
jumping
on
top
of
a
steamer
trunk
to
close
it
the
taxicab
was
at
the
door
and
we
had
just
time
to
make
the
night
train
the
steamer
sailed
early
the
next
morning
all
ready
cried
charlie
sands
getting
the
lid
down
finally
all
off
for
the
big
ditch
we
all
heard
a
noise
in
the
hall
a
sort
of
scuffling
with
an
occasional
groan
tish
rushed
over
and
threw
open
the
door
on
the
top
step
huddled
and
shivering
with
streams
of
water
running
off
his
hair
down
over
his
celluloid
collar
pouring
out
of
his
sleeves
and
cascading
down
the
stairs
from
his
trousers
legs
was
tufik
the
policeman
on
the
beat
was
prodding
at
him
with
his
foot
trying
to
make
him
get
up
when
he
saw
us
the
officer
touched
his
hat
evening
miss
tish
he
said
grinning
this
here
boy
of
yours
has
been
committing
suicide
just
fished
him
out
of
the
lake
in
the
park
get
up
snapped
charlie
sands
you
infernal
young
idiot
get
up
and
stop
sniveling
he
stooped
and
took
the
poor
boy
by
the
collar
his
brutality
roused
us
all
out
of
our
stupor
tish
and
i
rushed
forward
and
commanded
him
to
stand
back
and
aggie
with
more
presence
of
mind
than
we
had
given
her
credit
for
brought
a
glass
containing
a
tablespoonful
of
blackberry
cordial
into
which
she
had
poured
ten
drops
of
seasickness
remedy
tufik
was
white
and
groaning
but
he
revived
enough
to
sit
up
and
stare
at
us
with
his
sad
brown
eyes
i
wish
to
die
he
said
brokenly
why
you
do
not
let
me
die
my
friends
go
on
the
canal
i
am
alone
my
heart
is
empty
tish
wished
to
roll
him
on
a
barrel
but
we
had
no
barrel
so
with
charlie
sands
standing
by
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
refusing
to
assist
and
making
unkind
remarks
we
got
him
to
tish
room
and
laid
out
on
her
mackintosh
on
the
bed
he
did
not
want
to
live
we
could
hardly
force
him
to
drink
the
hot
coffee
tish
made
for
him
he
kept
muttering
things
about
his
loneliness
and
being
only
a
dirty
dago
and
then
he
turned
bitter
and
said
hard
things
about
this
great
america
where
he
could
find
no
work
and
must
be
a
burden
on
his
three
mothers
and
could
not
bring
his
dear
sister
to
be
company
for
him
aggie
quite
broke
down
and
had
to
lie
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
parlor
and
have
a
cracker
and
a
cup
of
tea
when
tish
and
i
had
succeeded
in
making
tufik
promise
to
live
and
had
given
him
one
of
his
own
silk
kimonos
to
put
on
until
his
clothing
could
be
dried
charlie
sands
having
disagreeably
refused
to
lend
his
overcoat
and
when
we
had
given
the
officer
five
dollars
not
to
arrest
the
boy
for
attempting
suicide
we
met
in
the
parlor
to
talk
things
over
charlie
sands
was
sitting
by
the
lamp
in
his
overcoat
he
had
put
our
railway
and
steamer
tickets
on
the
table
and
was
holding
his
cigarette
so
that
aggie
could
inhale
the
fumes
she
having
hay
fever
and
her
cubebs
being
on
their
way
to
panama
i
suppose
you
know
he
said
nastily
that
your
train
has
gone
and
that
you
can
not
get
the
boat
tomorrow
tish
was
in
an
exalted
mood
and
she
took
off
her
things
and
flung
them
on
a
chair
what
is
panama
she
demanded
to
saving
a
life
charlie
we
must
plan
something
for
this
boy
if
you
will
take
off
your
overcoat
and
see
you
put
it
on
that
little
parasite
not
if
i
melt
do
you
know
how
deep
the
lake
is
three
feet
one
can
drown
in
three
feet
of
water
said
aggie
sadly
if
one
is
very
tired
of
life
people
drown
themselves
in
bathtubs
tish
furious
retort
to
this
was
lost
tufik
choosing
that
moment
to
appear
in
the
doorway
he
wore
a
kimono
that
had
given
tish
bronchitis
early
in
the
winter
and
he
had
twisted
a
bath
towel
round
the
waist
he
looked
very
young
very
sad
very
oriental
he
ignored
charlie
sands
but
made
at
once
for
tish
and
dropped
on
one
knee
beside
her
miss
tish
he
begged
forgive
miss
tish
tufik
is
wicked
he
has
the
bad
heart
he
has
spoil
the
going
on
the
canal
no
get
up
said
tish
do
be
a
silly
child
go
and
take
your
shoes
out
of
the
oven
we
are
not
going
to
panama
when
you
are
better
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
good
scolding
charlie
sands
put
the
cigarette
on
a
book
under
aggie
nose
and
stood
up
i
guess
i
go
he
said
my
nerves
are
not
what
they
used
to
be
and
my
disposition
feels
the
change
tufik
had
risen
and
the
two
looked
at
each
other
i
could
not
quite
make
out
tufik
expression
had
i
not
known
his
gentleness
i
would
have
thought
his
expression
a
mixture
of
triumph
and
disdain
assyrian
came
down
like
a
wolf
on
the
fold
and
his
cohorts
were
gleaming
in
purple
and
gold
said
charlie
sands
and
went
out
slamming
the
door
iii
the
next
day
was
rainy
and
cold
aggie
sneezed
all
day
and
tish
had
neuralgia
being
unable
to
go
out
for
anything
to
eat
and
the
exaltation
of
the
night
before
having
passed
she
was
in
a
bad
humor
when
i
got
there
she
was
sitting
in
her
room
holding
a
bottle
to
her
face
and
staring
bitterly
at
the
plate
containing
a
piece
of
burned
toast
and
tufik
specialty
a
syrian
cake
crusted
with
sugar
i
wish
he
had
drowned
she
said
my
stomach
gone
lizzie
i
ate
one
of
those
cakes
for
breakfast
you
got
to
eat
this
one
i
do
nothing
of
the
sort
this
is
your
doing
tish
carberry
if
it
had
been
for
you
and
your
habit
of
picking
up
stray
cats
and
dogs
and
orientals
and
imposing
them
on
your
friends
we
be
on
the
ocean
on
our
way
to
a
decent
climate
the
next
time
your
duty
to
your
brother
man
overwhelms
you
you
better
lock
yourself
in
your
room
and
throw
the
key
out
the
window
tish
was
not
listening
however
her
eye
and
her
mind
both
were
on
the
cake
if
you
would
eat
it
and
then
take
some
essence
of
pepsin
she
hazarded
but
i
looked
her
full
it
the
eye
and
she
had
the
grace
to
color
he
loves
to
make
them
she
said
he
positively
beamed
when
he
brought
it
he
has
another
kind
he
is
making
now
of
pounded
beans
or
something
like
that
listen
i
listened
from
back
in
the
kitchen
came
a
sound
of
hammering
and
tufik
voice
lifted
in
a
low
plaintive
chant
he
says
that
song
is
about
the
valleys
of
lebanon
said
tish
miserably
lizzie
if
you
eat
half
of
it
i
eat
the
rest
my
answer
was
to
pick
up
the
plate
and
carry
it
into
the
bathroom
heroic
measures
were
necessary
tish
was
not
her
resolute
self
and
indeed
through
all
the
episode
of
tufik
and
the
shocking
denouement
that
followed
tish
was
a
spineless
individual
who
swayed
to
and
fro
with
every
breeze
she
divined
my
purpose
and
followed
me
to
the
bathroom
door
leave
some
crumbs
on
the
plate
she
whispered
it
will
look
more
natural
get
rid
of
the
toast
too
i
turned
and
faced
her
the
empty
plate
in
my
hands
tish
i
said
sternly
this
is
hypocrisy
which
is
just
next
door
to
lying
it
the
first
step
downward
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
boy
is
demoralizing
us
we
shall
have
to
get
rid
of
him
as
for
instance
she
sarcastically
asked
send
him
back
home
i
said
with
firmness
he
does
belong
here
he
is
accustomed
to
anything
faster
than
a
camel
he
does
know
how
to
work
none
of
them
do
he
comes
from
a
country
where
they
can
eat
food
like
this
because
digestion
is
one
of
their
occupations
i
was
right
and
tish
knew
it
even
tufik
was
satisfied
when
we
put
it
up
to
him
he
spread
his
hands
in
his
oriental
way
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
my
mothers
think
best
he
said
softly
in
my
own
land
tufik
is
known
i
sell
in
the
bazaar
the
so
fine
lace
my
sister
make
i
drink
wine
not
water
my
stomach
i
can
not
eat
in
this
america
but
i
have
no
money
we
will
furnish
the
money
tish
said
gently
but
you
must
promise
one
thing
tufik
you
must
not
become
a
mohammedan
before
that
i
die
he
said
proudly
and
there
is
something
else
tufik
something
rather
personal
but
i
want
you
to
promise
you
are
only
a
boy
but
when
you
are
a
man
tish
stopped
and
looked
to
me
for
help
miss
tish
means
this
i
put
in
you
are
to
have
only
one
wife
tufik
we
are
not
sending
you
back
to
start
a
harem
we
we
disapprove
strongly
of
er
anything
like
that
tufik
takes
but
one
wife
he
said
our
people
we
have
but
one
wife
my
first
child
it
is
called
tish
my
next
lizzie
and
my
next
aggie
pilk
all
for
my
so
kind
friends
and
one
i
call
charlie
sands
and
one
shall
be
hannah
so
that
tufik
never
forget
america
aggie
was
rather
put
out
when
we
told
her
what
we
had
done
but
after
eating
one
of
the
cakes
made
of
pounded
beans
and
sugar
under
triumphant
eyes
she
admitted
that
it
was
probably
for
the
best
that
evening
while
tufik
took
his
shrunken
and
wrinkled
clothing
to
be
pressed
by
a
little
tailor
in
the
neighborhood
who
did
tish
repairing
the
three
of
us
went
back
to
the
kitchen
and
tried
to
put
it
in
order
it
was
frightful
flour
and
burned
grease
over
everything
every
pan
dirty
dishes
all
over
the
place
and
a
cigarette
in
the
sugar
bin
but
it
touched
us
all
deeply
he
had
found
an
old
photograph
of
the
three
of
us
and
had
made
a
sort
of
shrine
of
the
the
picture
in
front
of
the
clock
and
in
front
of
the
picture
a
bunch
of
red
geraniums
while
we
were
looking
at
the
picture
and
aggie
was
at
the
sink
putting
water
in
the
glass
that
held
the
geraniums
tufik
having
forgotten
to
do
so
tish
neighbor
from
the
apartment
below
an
elderly
bachelor
came
up
the
service
staircase
and
knocked
at
the
door
tish
opened
it
humph
said
the
gentleman
from
below
gone
is
he
is
who
gone
your
thieving
syrian
madam
tish
stiffened
perhaps
she
said
if
you
will
explain
perhaps
snarled
the
visitor
you
will
explain
what
you
have
done
with
my
geraniums
why
do
you
raise
your
own
flowers
tish
was
quite
stunned
and
so
was
i
after
all
it
was
aggie
who
came
to
the
rescue
she
slammed
the
lid
on
to
the
teakettle
and
set
it
on
the
stove
with
a
bang
if
you
mean
she
said
indignantly
that
you
think
we
have
any
geraniums
of
yours
think
did
my
cook
see
your
thieving
servant
steal
off
the
box
on
the
then
perhaps
aggie
suggested
you
will
look
through
the
apartment
and
see
if
they
are
here
you
will
please
look
everywhere
tish
and
i
gasped
it
was
not
until
the
visitor
had
made
the
rounds
of
the
apartment
and
had
taken
an
apologetic
departure
that
tish
and
i
understood
the
teakettle
was
boiling
and
from
its
spout
coming
a
spicy
and
familiar
odor
aggie
took
it
off
the
stove
and
removed
the
lid
the
geraniums
boiled
to
a
pulp
were
inside
back
to
syria
that
boy
goes
said
tish
viewing
the
floral
remains
he
did
it
out
of
love
and
we
must
not
chide
him
but
we
have
our
own
immortal
souls
to
think
of
the
next
morning
two
things
happened
we
gave
tufik
one
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
to
buy
a
ticket
back
to
syria
and
to
keep
him
in
funds
on
the
way
and
tish
got
a
note
from
hannah
miss
i
here
you
still
have
the
dago
or
as
my
husband
says
he
still
has
you
i
am
redy
to
live
up
to
my
bargen
if
you
are
hannah
i
have
lerned
a
new
salud
very
rich
but
delissious
in
spite
of
herself
tish
looked
haunted
it
was
the
salad
no
doubt
she
said
nothing
but
she
looked
round
the
untidy
rooms
where
everything
that
would
hold
it
had
a
linen
cover
with
a
edge
all
of
them
soiled
and
wrinkled
she
watched
tufik
chanting
about
the
plains
of
lebanon
and
shoving
the
with
a
bang
against
her
best
furniture
and
with
hannah
salad
in
mind
she
sniffed
a
warning
odor
from
the
kitchen
that
told
of
more
syrian
experiments
with
her
digestion
tish
surrendered
that
morning
she
wrote
to
hannah
that
tufik
was
going
back
to
syria
and
to
come
and
bring
the
salad
recipe
with
her
that
was
i
think
on
a
monday
tufik
steamer
sailed
on
thursday
on
tuesday
aggie
and
i
went
shopping
and
in
a
spirit
of
repentance
for
we
felt
we
were
not
solving
tufik
question
but
getting
rid
of
him
we
bought
him
a
complete
new
outfit
he
almost
disgraced
us
by
kissing
our
hands
in
the
store
and
while
we
were
buying
him
some
ties
he
disappeared
to
come
back
later
with
the
rims
of
his
eyes
red
from
weeping
his
gentle
soul
was
touched
with
gratitude
aggie
had
to
tell
him
firmly
that
if
he
kissed
any
more
hands
he
would
get
his
ears
boxed
the
clerks
in
the
store
were
all
interested
and
two
or
three
followed
us
round
and
stood
staring
at
us
neither
aggie
nor
i
knew
anything
about
masculine
attire
and
tufik
idea
was
a
suit
with
nothing
underneath
a
and
collar
of
celluloid
and
a
green
necktie
already
tied
and
hooking
on
to
his
he
was
dazed
when
we
bought
him
a
steamer
trunk
and
a
rug
and
disappeared
again
returning
in
a
few
moments
with
a
small
paper
bag
full
of
gumdrops
we
were
quite
touched
that
as
i
say
was
on
tuesday
tufik
had
been
sleeping
in
since
his
desperate
attempt
at
suicide
and
we
sent
his
things
to
tish
apartment
that
evening
tufik
asked
permission
to
spend
the
night
with
a
friend
in
the
restaurant
business
a
damascan
tish
let
him
go
against
my
advice
he
eat
a
lot
of
that
syrian
food
i
objected
and
get
sick
and
miss
his
boat
and
we
have
the
whole
thing
over
again
but
tish
was
adamant
it
his
last
night
she
said
and
he
has
promised
not
to
smoke
any
cigarettes
and
i
given
him
two
pepsin
tablets
this
is
the
land
of
the
free
lizzie
we
were
to
meet
tufik
at
the
station
next
morning
and
we
arranged
a
lunch
for
him
to
eat
on
the
train
aggie
bringing
fried
chicken
and
i
sandwiches
and
cake
tish
domestic
arrangements
being
upset
she
supplied
fruit
figs
and
dates
mostly
to
make
him
think
of
home
the
train
left
early
and
none
of
us
felt
very
cheerful
at
having
to
be
about
aggie
sat
in
the
station
and
sneezed
tish
had
a
pain
above
her
eye
and
sat
by
a
heater
we
had
the
luncheon
in
a
large
shoebox
wrapped
in
oiled
paper
to
keep
it
moist
he
never
appeared
the
train
was
called
filled
up
and
left
people
took
to
staring
at
us
as
we
sat
there
aggie
sneezed
and
tish
held
her
eye
and
no
tufik
in
a
sort
of
helpless
breakfastless
rage
we
called
a
taxicab
and
went
to
tish
no
one
said
much
we
were
all
thinking
we
were
hungry
so
we
spread
out
the
shoebox
lunch
on
one
of
the
covers
and
ate
it
mostly
in
silence
the
steamer
trunk
and
the
rug
had
gone
we
let
them
go
they
might
go
to
jerusalem
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
after
we
had
eaten
about
eleven
i
think
tish
got
up
and
surveyed
the
apartment
then
with
a
savage
gleam
in
her
eye
she
whisked
off
all
the
fancy
linens
the
cluny
laces
the
hemstitched
bedspreads
and
piled
them
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
aggie
and
i
watched
her
in
silence
she
said
nothing
but
kicked
the
whole
lot
into
the
bottom
of
a
cupboard
when
she
had
slammed
the
door
she
turned
and
faced
us
grimly
that
roll
of
has
cost
me
about
five
hundred
dollars
she
said
it
been
worth
it
if
it
teaches
me
that
i
an
old
fool
and
that
you
are
two
others
if
that
boy
shows
his
face
here
again
hand
him
over
to
the
police
however
as
it
happened
she
did
nothing
of
the
sort
at
four
that
afternoon
there
was
a
timid
ring
at
the
doorbell
and
i
answered
it
outside
was
tufik
forlorn
and
drooping
and
held
up
by
main
force
by
a
tall
man
with
a
heavy
mustache
i
bring
your
boy
said
the
mustached
person
smiling
he
has
great
trouble
sorrow
he
faint
with
grief
i
took
a
good
look
at
tufik
then
he
was
pale
and
shaky
and
his
new
suit
looked
as
if
he
had
slept
in
it
his
collar
was
bent
and
wilted
and
the
green
necktie
had
been
taken
off
and
exchanged
for
a
ragged
black
one
miss
liz
he
said
huskily
i
die
the
heart
is
gone
my
parent
he
broke
down
again
and
leaning
against
the
door
jamb
he
buried
his
face
in
a
handkerchief
that
i
could
not
believe
was
one
of
the
lot
we
had
bought
only
yesterday
i
hardly
knew
what
to
do
tish
had
said
she
was
through
with
the
boy
i
decided
to
close
them
out
in
the
hallway
until
we
had
held
a
council
but
tufik
foot
was
on
the
sill
and
the
more
i
asked
him
to
move
it
the
harder
he
wept
the
mustached
person
said
it
was
quite
true
tufik
father
had
died
of
the
plague
the
letter
had
come
early
that
morning
beirut
was
full
of
the
plague
he
waved
the
letter
at
me
but
i
ordered
him
to
burn
it
immediately
on
account
of
germs
i
brought
him
a
shovel
to
burn
it
on
and
when
that
was
over
tufik
had
worked
out
his
own
salvation
he
was
at
the
door
of
tish
room
pouring
out
to
aggie
and
tish
his
grief
and
offering
the
black
necktie
as
proof
we
were
just
where
we
had
started
but
minus
one
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
for
the
gentleman
having
gone
after
trying
to
sell
tish
another
silk
kimono
i
demanded
tufik
ticket
to
be
redeemed
and
was
met
with
two
empty
hands
outstretched
oh

friends

miss

miss

tish
sternly
i

minute
and
get
it
over
she
ees
so
little
he
said
wistfully
and

body
of
my
parent

let
it
lie
and

in
the
so
hot
sun

my
parent
and
then
she
comes
to
this
so
great
america
the
land
of
my
good
friends
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
aggie
sneezed
iv
i
shall
pass
over
the
next
month
with
its
unpleasantnesses
over
charlie
sands
coming
one
evening
with
a
black
tie
and
on
the
strength
of
having
killed
a
dog
with
his
machine
asking
for
money
to
bury
it
and
bring
another
one
from
syria
i
shall
not
more
than
mention
hannah
who
kept
tish
physically
comfortable
and
well
fed
and
mentally
wretched
having
a
teakettle
of
boiling
water
always
ready
if
tufik
came
to
the
apartment
i
shall
say
nothing
of
our
success
in
getting
him
employment
in
the
foreign
department
of
a
bank
and
his
ending
up
by
washing
its
windows
or
of
the
position
tish
got
him
as
elevator
boy
in
her
hospital
where
he
jammed
the
car
in
some
way
and
held
up
four
surgeons
and
three
nurses
and
a
patient
on
his
way
to
the
until
the
patient
changed
his
mind
and
refused
to
be
operated
on
aggie
had
a
brilliant
idea
about
the
census
that
he
could
make
the
census
reports
in
the
syrian
district
to
this
end
she
worked
for
some
time
coaching
tufik
for
the
examination
only
to
have
him
fail
fail
absolutely
and
without
hope
he
was
staying
in
the
syrian
quarter
at
that
time
on
account
of
hannah
and
he
brought
us
various
tempting
offers
now
and
then
a
fruit
stand
that
could
be
bought
for
a
hundred
dollars
a
restaurant
for
fifty
a
tailor
shop
for
but
as
he
knew
nothing
of
fruits
or
restaurants
or
tailoring
we
refused
to
invest
tish
said
that
we
had
been
a
good
while
getting
to
it
but
that
we
were
being
businesslike
at
last
we
gave
the
boy
nine
dollars
a
week
and
not
a
penny
more
and
we
refused
to
buy
any
more
of
his
silly
linens
and
crocheted
laces
we
were
quite
firm
with
him
and
now
i
come
to
the
arriving
of
tufik
little
sister
not
that
she
was
really
little
but
that
comes
later
tufik
had
decided
at
last
on
what
he
would
be
in
our
so
great
america
once
or
twice
when
he
was
tired
or
discouraged
tish
had
taken
him
out
in
her
machine
and
he
had
been
thrilled
really
thrilled
he
did
not
seem
able
to
learn
how
to
crank
it
tish
car
is
hard
to
crank
but
he
learned
how
to
light
the
lamps
and
to
spot
a
policeman
two
blocks
away
several
times
when
we
were
going
into
the
country
tish
took
him
because
it
gave
her
a
sense
of
security
to
have
a
man
along
having
come
from
a
country
where
the
general
travel
is
by
camel
however
he
had
not
the
first
idea
of
machinery
he
thought
tish
made
the
engine
go
by
pressing
on
the
clutch
with
her
foot
like
a
sewing
machine
and
he
regarded
her
strength
with
awe
and
once
when
we
were
filling
a
tire
from
an
air
bottle
and
the
tube
burst
and
struck
him
he
declared
there
was
a
demon
in
the
air
bottle
and
said
a
prayer
in
the
middle
of
the
road
about
that
time
tish
learned
of
a
school
for
chauffeurs
and
the
three
of
us
decided
to
divide
the
expense
and
send
him
in
three
months
tish
explained
we
can
get
him
a
state
license
and
he
can
drive
a
taxicab
it
will
suit
him
because
he
can
sit
to
do
it
so
tufik
went
to
an
automobile
school
and
stood
by
while
some
one
drew
pictures
of
parts
of
the
engine
on
a
blackboard
and
took
home
lists
of
words
that
he
translated
into
arabic
at
the
library
and
learned
everything
but
why
and
how
the
engine
of
an
automobile
goes
he
still
thought
at
the
end
of
two
months
that
the
driver
did
it
with
his
foot
but
we
were
ignorant
of
all
that
he
would
drop
round
in
the
evenings
when
hannah
was
out
or
in
bed
and
tell
us
what
magneto
was
in
arabic
and
how
he
would
soon
be
able
to
care
for
tish
car
and
would
not
take
a
cent
for
it
doing
it
at
night
when
the
taxicab
was
resting
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
we
bought
him
a
chauffeur
outfit
the
next
day
the
sister
arrived
and
tufik
brought
her
to
aggie
where
we
were
waiting
we
had
not
told
hannah
about
the
sister
she
would
not
have
understood
charlie
sands
telephoned
while
we
were
waiting
and
asked
if
he
might
come
over
and
help
receive
the
girl
we
were
to
greet
her
and
welcome
her
to
america
then
she
was
to
go
to
the
home
of
the
syrian
with
the
large
mustache
charlie
sands
came
in
and
shook
hands
all
round
surveying
each
of
us
carefully
strange
he
muttered
curious
is
no
name
for
it
what
do
we
know
of
the
vagaries
of
the
human
mind
three
minds
and
one
obsession
he
said
with
the
utmost
gentleness
three
maiden
ladies
who
have
lived
impeccable
lives
for
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
how
many
years
and
now
this
oh
aunt
tish
dear
aunt
tish
he
got
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
eyes
tish
was
speechless
with
rage
but
i
rose
to
our
defense
we
do
want
to
do
it
and
you
know
it
i
said
tartly
but
when
the
lord
sends
want
and
suffering
to
one
very
door
want
with
large
brown
eyes
and
a
gentle
voice
he
retorted
my
dear
ladies
it
your
money
and
i
dare
say
it
costs
you
less
than
bridge
at
five
cents
a
point
or
the
gay
white
way
but
for
heaven
sake
my
respected
but
foolish
virgins
why
not
an
american
that
wants
a
real
job
why
let
a
sticky
oriental
pull
your
legs
charlie
sands
cried
tish
rising
in
her
wrath
i
will
not
endure
such
vulgarity
and
when
tufik
takes
you
out
in
a
taxicab
god
forbid
said
charlie
sands
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
sister
she
did
not
look
like
tufik
and
she
was
tired
and
dirty
from
the
journey
but
she
had
big
brown
eyes
and
masses
of
dark
hair
and
she
spoke
not
a
single
word
of
english
tufik
joy
was
boundless
his
soft
eyes
were
snapping
with
excitement
and
aggie
who
is
sentimental
was
obliged
to
go
out
and
swallow
half
a
glass
of
water
without
breathing
to
keep
from
crying
charlie
sands
said
nothing
but
sat
back
in
a
corner
and
watched
us
all
and
once
he
took
out
his
notebook
and
made
a
memorandum
of
something
he
showed
it
to
us
later
tufik
sister
was
the
calmest
of
us
all
i
believe
she
sat
on
a
stiff
chair
near
the
door
and
turned
her
brown
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
tish
said
that
proper
clothing
would
make
her
beautiful
and
aggie
disappearing
for
a
few
minutes
came
back
with
her
last
summer
foulard
and
a
jet
bonnet
when
the
poor
thing
understood
they
were
for
her
she
looked
almost
frightened
the
thing
being
unexpected
and
tufik
in
a
paroxysm
of
delight
kissed
all
our
hands
and
the
girl
on
each
cheek
tish
says
our
vulgar
is
unknown
in
the
orient
and
that
they
rub
noses
by
way
of
greeting
i
think
however
that
she
is
mistaken
in
this
and
that
the
australians
are
the
i
recall
a
returned
missionary
telling
this
but
i
can
not
remember
just
where
he
had
been
stationed
things
were
very
quiet
for
a
couple
of
weeks
tufik
came
round
only
once
to
tell
us
that
having
to
pay
car
fare
to
get
to
the
automobile
school
his
nine
dollars
were
not
enough
we
added
a
dollar
a
week
under
protest
and
tish
suggested
with
some
asperity
that
as
he
was
only
busy
four
hours
a
day
he
might
find
some
light
employment
for
the
balance
of
the
day
he
spread
out
his
hands
and
drew
up
his
shoulders
my
friends
are
angry
he
said
sadly
it
is
not
enough
that
i
study
i
must
also
work
ver
well
i
labor
i
sell
the
newspaper
but
to
buy
newspapers
one
must
have
money
a
dollar
two
dollars
ver
leetle
only
i
have
it
not
we
gave
him
another
dollar
and
he
went
out
smiling
and
hopeful
it
seemed
that
at
last
we
had
solved
his
problem
tish
recalled
one
of
her
scholars
who
sold
papers
and
saved
enough
to
buy
a
automobile
and
rear
a
family
but
our
fond
hopes
were
dashed
to
the
ground
when
the
next
morning
hannah
opening
the
door
at
to
bring
in
the
milk
bottles
found
a
huge
stack
of
the
newspapers
and
a
note
on
top
addressed
to
tish
which
said
mother
you
see
now
that
i
am
no
good
i
wish
to
die
i
hav
one
papier
sold
and
newsboys
kell
me
on
sight
i
hav
but
you
and
god
and
god
has
forget
tufik
we
were
discouraged
and
so
clearly
was
tufik
for
ten
days
we
did
not
hear
from
him
except
that
a
flirty
little
syrian
boy
called
for
the
ten
dollars
on
saturday
and
brought
a
pair
of
tufik
shoes
for
us
to
have
resoled
but
one
day
tish
telephoned
in
some
excitement
and
said
that
tufik
was
there
and
wanted
us
to
go
to
a
wedding
his
little
sister
wedding
she
explained
the
dear
child
is
all
excited
he
says
it
has
been
going
on
for
two
days
and
this
is
the
day
of
the
ceremony
aggie
was
spending
the
afternoon
with
me
and
spoke
up
hastily
ask
her
if
i
have
time
to
go
home
and
put
on
my
broadcloth
she
said
i
not
fixed
for
a
wedding
tish
said
there
was
no
time
she
would
come
round
with
the
machine
and
we
were
to
be
ready
in
fifteen
minutes
aggie
hesitated
on
account
of
intending
to
wash
her
hair
that
night
and
so
not
having
put
up
her
crimps
but
she
finally
agreed
to
go
and
tish
came
for
us
tufik
was
in
the
machine
he
looked
very
tidy
and
wore
the
shoes
we
had
had
repaired
a
pink
carnation
in
his
buttonhole
and
an
air
of
suppressed
excitement
at
last
he
said
joyously
while
tish
cranked
the
car
at
last
my
friends
see
my
three
mothers
they
think
tufik
only
talks
now
they
see
and
the
priest
will
bless
my
mothers
on
this
so
happy
day
tish
having
crawled
panting
from
her
exertion
into
the
driver
seat
and
taken
the
wheel
in
sheer
excess
of
boyish
excitement
he
leaned
over
and
kissed
the
hand
nearest
him
the
janitor
small
boy
was
on
the
curb
watching
and
at
that
he
set
up
a
yell
of
joy
we
left
him
calling
awful
things
after
us
and
tish
face
was
a
study
but
soon
the
care
of
the
machine
made
her
forget
everything
else
the
syrian
quarter
was
not
impressive
it
was
on
a
hillside
above
the
russian
jewish
colony
and
consisted
of
a
network
of
alleys
indescribably
dirty
and
incredibly
steep
in
one
or
two
of
these
alleys
tish
was
obliged
to
turn
the
car
and
go
up
backward
her
machine
climbing
much
better
on
the
reverse
gear
crowds
of
children
followed
us
dogs
got
under
the
wheels
and
apparently
died
judging
by
the
yelps
only
to
follow
us
with
undiminished
energy
after
they
had
picked
themselves
up
we
fought
and
won
a
battle
with
a
barrel
of
ashes
and
came
out
victorious
but
dusty
and
at
last
as
tufik
made
a
lordly
gesture
we
stopped
at
an
angle
of
degrees
and
tufik
bowed
us
out
of
the
car
he
stood
by
visibly
glowing
with
happiness
while
tish
got
a
cobblestone
and
placed
it
under
a
wheel
and
aggie
and
i
took
in
our
surroundings
we
were
in
an
alley
ten
feet
wide
and
paved
indiscriminately
with
stones
and
tin
cans
babies
and
broken
bottles
before
us
was
a
brick
house
with
broken
windows
and
a
high
railed
wooden
stoop
minus
two
steps
under
the
stoop
was
a
door
leading
into
a
cellar
and
from
this
cellar
was
coming
a
curious
stamping
noise
and
a
sound
as
of
an
animal
in
its
death
throes
aggie
caught
my
arm
what
that
she
quavered
i
had
no
time
to
reply
tufik
had
thrown
open
the
door
and
stood
aside
to
let
us
pass
they
dance
he
said
gravely
there
is
always
much
dancing
before
a
wedding
the
music
one
hears
is
of
damascus
and
he
who
dances
now
is
a
sheik
among
his
people
reassured
as
to
the
sounds
we
stepped
down
into
the
basement
that
was
at
four
in
the
afternoon
i
have
never
been
fairly
clear
as
to
what
followed
and
aggie
memory
is
a
complete
blank
i
remember
a
long
and
floored
cellar
smelling
very
damp
and
lighted
by
flaring
gas
jets
the
center
was
empty
save
for
a
swarthy
gentleman
in
a
fez
and
his
wearing
a
pair
of
green
suspenders
and
dancing
alone
a
curious
stamping
dance
that
kept
time
to
a
drum
i
remember
the
musicians
too
three
of
them
in
a
corner
one
playing
on
a
sort
of
affair
of
reeds
one
on
a
instrument
that
looked
like
a
guitar
with
zither
ambitions
and
a
drummer
who
chanted
with
his
eyes
shut
and
kept
time
to
his
chants
by
beating
on
a
sheepskin
tied
over
the
mouth
of
a
brass
bowl
round
three
sides
of
the
room
were
long
oil
tables
and
in
preparation
for
the
ceremony
a
little
syrian
girl
was
sweeping
up
peanut
shells
ashes
and
beer
bottles
with
absolute
disregard
of
the
guests
all
round
the
wall
behind
rows
of
beer
bottles
dishes
of
bananas
and
plates
of
raw
liver
were
men
syrians
with
white
teeth
gleaming
and
black
hair
plastered
close
and
celluloid
collars
orientals
who
came
up
gravely
one
by
one
and
shook
hands
with
us
who
pressed
on
us
beer
and
peanuts
and
raw
liver
aggie
speaking
between
sneezes
and
over
the
chanting
and
the
drum
bent
toward
me
it
a
breath
of
the
orient
she
said
ecstatically
oh
lizzie
do
you
think
i
could
buy
that
drum
for
my
tabouret
orient
observed
tish
coughing
i
going
out
and
take
the
out
of
that
car
and
i
wish
i
brought
charlie
sands
it
was
in
vain
we
reminded
her
that
the
syrians
are
a
pastoral
people
and
that
they
come
from
the
land
of
the
bible
she
looked
round
her
grimly
they
look
like
a
lot
of
bandits
to
me
she
sniffed
and
always
a
murder
at
a
wedding
of
this
sort
there
is
a
woman
here
but
ourselves
she
was
exceedingly
disagreeable
and
aggie
and
i
began
to
get
uncomfortable
but
when
tufik
brought
us
little
glasses
filled
with
a
milky
stuff
and
assured
us
that
the
women
had
only
gone
to
prepare
the
bride
we
felt
reassured
he
said
that
etiquette
demanded
that
we
drink
the
milky
white
stuff
tish
was
inclined
to
demur
has
it
any
alcohol
in
it
she
demanded
tufik
did
not
understand
but
he
said
it
was
harmless
and
given
to
all
the
syrian
babies
and
while
we
were
still
undecided
aggie
sniffed
it
it
smells
like
paregoric
tish
she
said
i
sure
it
harmless
we
took
it
then
it
tasted
sweet
and
rather
spicy
and
aggie
said
it
stopped
her
sneezing
at
once
it
was
very
mild
and
pleasant
and
rather
medicinal
in
its
flavor
we
each
had
two
little
glasses
and
tish
said
she
would
not
bother
about
the
the
car
was
insured
against
theft
a
little
later
aggie
said
she
used
to
do
a
little
jig
step
when
she
was
a
girl
and
if
they
would
play
slower
she
would
like
to
see
if
she
had
forgotten
it
tish
did
not
hear
this
she
was
talking
to
tufik
and
a
moment
later
she
got
up
and
went
out
aggie
had
decided
to
ask
the
musicians
to
play
a
little
slower
and
i
had
my
hands
full
with
her
so
it
was
with
horror
that
shortly
after
i
heard
the
whirring
of
the
engine
and
through
the
cellar
window
caught
a
glimpse
of
tish
machine
starting
off
up
the
hill
i
rose
excitedly
but
tufik
was
before
me
smiling
and
bowing
miss
tish
has
gone
for
the
bride
he
said
softly
the
taxicab
not
come
soon
the
priest
arrive
and
so
great
shame
the
bride
is
not
here
miss
tish
is
my
mother
my
heart
delight
when
aggie
realized
that
tish
had
gone
she
was
rather
upset
she
depends
a
great
deal
on
tish
and
she
took
another
of
the
little
glasses
of
milky
stuff
to
revive
her
i
was
a
little
bit
nervous
with
tish
gone
and
the
sun
setting
and
another
tub
of
beer
bottles
brought
in
though
the
people
were
orderly
enough
and
tufik
stood
near
but
aggie
began
to
feel
very
strange
and
declared
that
the
man
with
the
sheepskin
drum
was
winking
at
her
and
that
her
head
was
twitching
round
on
her
shoulders
and
when
a
dozen
or
so
young
syrians
formed
a
circle
their
hands
on
each
other
shoulders
and
sang
a
melancholy
chant
stamping
to
beat
time
she
wept
with
sheer
sentiment
ha
hoo
ta
ta
ta
they
chanted
in
unison
and
tufik
bent
over
us
his
soft
eyes
beaming
they
are
shepherds
and
the
sons
of
shepherds
from
palestine
he
whispered
that
is
the
shepherd
call
to
his
sheep
in
my
country
many
are
shepherds
perhaps
some
day
you
go
with
me
back
to
my
country
and
we
hear
the
shepherd
call
his
sheep
hoo
ta
ta
ta
and
we
hear
the
sleepy
sheep
reply
it
is
too
beautiful
murmured
aggie
it
is
the
holy
land
all
over
again
and
we
should
never
have
known
this
but
for
you
tufik
just
then
some
one
near
the
door
clapped
his
hands
and
all
the
noise
ceased
those
who
were
standing
sat
down
the
little
girl
with
the
broom
swept
the
accumulations
of
the
room
under
a
chair
and
put
the
broom
in
a
corner
the
music
became
loud
and
stirring
aggie
swayed
toward
me
i
sick
lizzie
she
gasped
that
paregoric
stuff
has
poisoned
me
air
i
took
one
arm
and
tufik
the
other
and
we
got
her
out
and
seated
on
one
of
the
wooden
steps
she
was
a
color
and
the
whites
of
her
eyes
were
yellow
but
i
had
little
time
for
aggie
tufik
caught
my
hand
and
pointed
tish
machine
was
coming
down
the
alley
beside
her
sat
tufik
sister
sobbing
at
the
top
of
her
voice
and
wearing
aggie
foulard
a
pair
of
cotton
gloves
and
a
lace
curtain
over
her
head
behind
in
the
tonneau
were
her
maid
of
honor
a
young
syrian
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
four
other
children
about
her
but
that
was
not
all
in
front
of
the
machine
marching
slowly
and
with
dignity
were
three
bearded
gentlemen
two
in
coats
and
one
in
a
striped
vest
blowing
on
curious
double
flutes
and
making
a
shrill
wailing
noise
and
all
round
were
crowds
of
women
and
children
carrying
tin
pans
and
paper
bags
full
of
parched
peas
which
they
were
flinging
with
all
their
might
i
caught
tish
eye
as
the
procession
stopped
and
she
looked
subdued
almost
stunned
the
pipers
still
piped
but
the
bride
refused
to
move
instead
her
wails
rose
higher
and
aggie
who
had
paid
no
attention
so
far
but
was
sitting
back
with
her
eyes
shut
looked
up
lizzhie
she
said
thickly
tish
looks
about
the
way
i
feel
and
with
that
she
fell
to
laughing
awful
laughter
that
mingled
with
the
cries
and
the
wail
of
the
pipes
the
bride
after
a
struggle
was
taken
by
force
from
the
machine
and
placed
on
a
chair
against
the
wall
her
veil
was
torn
and
her
wreath
crooked
and
she
observed
a
sulky
silence
to
our
amazement
tufik
was
still
smiling
urbane
and
cheerful
it
is
the
custom
of
my
country
my
mothers
he
said
the
bride
leave
with
tears
the
home
of
her
good
parents
or
of
her
friends
and
she
speak
no
word
only
weep
until
she
is
marriaged
ah
the
priest
the
rest
of
the
story
is
short
and
somewhat
blurred
tish
having
broken
her
glasses
aggie
being
as
one
may
say
de
and
i
having
developed
a
frightful
headache
in
the
dust
and
bad
air
the
real
meaning
of
what
was
occurring
did
not
penetrate
to
any
of
us
the
priest
officiated
from
a
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
on
which
he
placed
two
candles
an
arabic
bible
and
a
sacred
picture
all
of
which
he
took
out
of
a
brown
valise
he
himself
wore
a
long
black
robe
and
a
beard
and
looked
as
tish
observed
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
had
stepped
from
an
egyptian
painting
before
him
stood
tufik
sister
the
maid
of
honor
with
her
baby
the
friend
who
had
brought
tufik
to
us
after
his
tragic
attempt
at
suicide
and
tufik
himself
illustration
the
real
meaning
of
what
was
occurring
did
not
penetrate
to
any
of
us
everybody
held
lighted
candles
and
the
heat
was
frightful
the
music
ceased
there
was
much
exhorting
in
arabic
much
reading
from
the
book
many
soft
replies
indiscriminately
from
the
four
principals
and
then
suddenly
tish
turned
and
gripped
my
arm
lizzie
she
said
hoarsely
that
little
thief
and
liar
has
done
us
again
that
is
his
sister
at
all
he
marrying
her
for
us
to
keep
luckily
aggie
grew
faint
again
at
that
moment
and
we
led
her
out
into
the
open
air
behind
us
the
ceremony
seemed
to
be
over
the
drum
was
beating
the
pipes
screaming
the
lute
thrumming
tish
let
in
the
clutch
with
a
vicious
jerk
and
the
whir
of
the
engine
drowned
out
the
beating
of
the
drum
and
the
clapping
of
the
hands
twilight
hid
the
tin
cans
and
and
the
dogs
slept
on
the
cool
pavements
in
the
doorways
syrian
women
rocked
their
babies
to
drowsy
chants
the
air
revived
aggie
she
leaned
forward
and
touched
tish
on
the
shoulder
after
all
she
said
softly
if
he
loves
her
very
much
and
there
was
no
other
way
do
you
remember
that
night
she
arrived
how
he
looked
at
her
yes
tish
snapped
and
i
remember
the
way
he
looked
at
us
every
time
he
wanted
money
we
been
a
lot
of
sheep
and
we
been
sheared
good
and
proper
but
we
need
bleat
with
joy
about
it
as
we
drew
up
at
my
door
tish
pulled
out
her
watch
it
seven
she
said
brusquely
i
am
going
to
new
york
on
the
train
and
i
shall
take
the
first
steamer
outward
bound
i
need
a
rest
i
go
anywhere
but
to
the
holy
land
we
went
to
panama
two
months
afterward
in
the
dusk
of
a
late
spring
evening
charlie
sands
met
us
at
the
station
and
took
us
to
tish
in
a
taxicab
we
were
homesick
tired
and
dirty
and
aggie
who
had
been
frightfully
seasick
was
clamoring
for
tea
as
the
taxicab
drew
up
at
the
curb
tish
clutched
my
arm
and
aggie
uttered
a
muffled
cry
and
promptly
sneezed
seated
on
the
doorstep
celluloid
collar
shining
the
brown
pasteboard
suitcase
at
his
feet
was
tufik
he
sat
calmly
smoking
a
cigarette
his
eyes
upturned
in
placid
and
oriental
contemplation
of
the
heavens
drive
on
said
tish
desperately
if
he
sees
us
we
are
lost
drive
where
demanded
charlie
tufik
gaze
had
dropped
gradually
another
moment
and
his
brown
eyes
would
rest
on
us
but
just
then
a
diversion
occurred
a
window
overhead
opened
with
a
slam
and
a
stream
of
hot
water
descended
it
had
been
carefully
aimed
as
if
with
long
practice
tufik
was
apparently
not
surprised
he
it
with
a
boredom
as
of
many
repetitions
and
picking
up
his
suitcase
stood
at
a
safe
distance
looking
up
first
in
his
gentle
voice
he
addressed
the
window
in
arabic
then
from
a
safer
distance
in
english
you
ugly
old
he
said
softly
when
my
three
old
women
come
back
i
eat
you
skin
and
bones
and
they
shall
say
nothing
they
love
me
tufik
i
am
their
child
aye
and
my
child
which
comes
will
be
their
grandchild
he
kissed
his
fingers
to
the
upper
window
which
closed
with
a
slam
tufik
stooped
picked
up
his
suitcase
and
saw
the
taxi
for
the
first
time
even
in
the
twilight
we
saw
his
face
change
his
brown
eyes
brighten
his
teeth
show
in
his
boyish
smile
the
taxicab
driver
had
stalled
his
engine
and
was
cranking
it
sh
i
said
desperately
and
we
all
cowered
back
into
the
shadows
tufik
approached
uncertainty
changing
to
certainty
the
engine
was
started
now
oh
for
a
second
of
time
he
was
at
the
window
now
peering
into
the
darkness
miss
tish
he
said
breathlessly
no
one
answered
we
hardly
breathed
and
then
suddenly
aggie
sneezed
miss
pilk
he
shouted
in
delight
my
mothers
my
so
dear
friends
the
machine
jerked
started
moved
slowly
off
he
ran
beside
it
a
hand
on
the
door
tish
bent
forward
to
speak
but
charlie
sands
put
his
hand
over
her
mouth
and
so
we
left
him
standing
in
the
street
undecided
staring
after
us
wistfully
uncertainly
the
suitcase
full
of
centerpieces
crocheted
lace
silk
kimonos
and
embroidered
bedspreads
in
his
hand
that
night
we
hid
in
a
hotel
and
the
next
day
we
started
for
europe
we
heard
nothing
from
tufik
but
on
the
anniversary
of
wiggins
death
while
we
were
in
berlin
aggie
received
a
small
package
forwarded
from
home
it
was
a
small
lace
doily
and
pinned
to
it
was
a
card
it
read
for
the
sadness
miss
pilk
tufik
aggie
cried
over
it
the
simple
lifers
i
i
suppose
there
is
something
in
all
of
us
that
harks
back
to
the
soil
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
what
are
picnics
but
outcroppings
of
instinct
no
one
really
enjoys
them
or
expects
to
enjoy
them
but
with
the
first
warm
days
some
prehistoric
instinct
takes
us
out
into
the
woods
to
fry
potatoes
over
a
strangling
wood
fire
and
spend
the
next
week
getting
grass
stains
out
of
our
clothes
it
must
be
instinct
every
atom
of
intelligence
warns
us
to
stay
at
home
near
the
refrigerator
tish
is
really
a
child
of
instinct
she
is
intelligent
enough
but
in
a
contest
between
instinct
and
brains
she
always
follows
her
instinct
aggie
under
the
same
circumstances
follows
her
heart
as
for
me
i
generally
follow
tish
and
aggie
and
they
led
me
into
some
curious
places
this
is
really
a
sort
of
apology
because
whereas
usually
tish
leads
off
and
we
follow
her
in
the
adventure
of
the
simple
life
we
were
all
equally
guilty
tish
made
the
suggestion
but
we
needed
no
urging
as
you
know
this
summer
two
years
ago
was
a
fairly
good
one
as
summers
go
plenty
of
fair
weather
only
two
or
three
really
hot
spells
and
not
a
great
deal
of
rain
charlie
sands
tish
nephew
went
over
to
england
in
june
to
report
the
visit
of
the
french
president
to
london
for
his
newspaper
and
tish
automobile
had
been
sent
to
the
factory
to
be
gone
over
she
had
been
teaching
aggie
to
drive
it
and
owing
to
aggie
thinking
she
had
her
foot
on
the
brake
when
it
was
really
on
the
gas
they
had
leaped
a
ditch
and
gone
down
into
a
deep
ravine
from
which
both
tish
and
aggie
had
had
to
be
pulled
up
with
ropes
well
with
no
machine
and
charlie
sands
away
we
hardly
knew
how
to
plan
the
summer
tish
thought
at
first
she
would
stay
at
home
and
learn
to
ride
she
thought
her
liver
needed
stirring
up
she
used
to
ride
she
said
and
it
was
like
sitting
in
a
only
perhaps
more
so
aggie
and
i
went
out
to
her
first
lesson
but
when
i
found
she
had
bought
a
divided
skirt
and
was
going
to
try
a
man
saddle
i
could
not
restrain
my
indignation
i
going
tish
i
said
firmly
when
she
had
come
out
of
the
and
i
realized
the
situation
i
sha
attempt
to
restrain
you
but
i
shall
not
remain
to
witness
your
shame
tish
eyed
me
coldly
when
you
wish
to
lecture
me
she
snapped
about
revealing
to
the
public
that
i
have
two
legs
if
i
do
wear
a
skirt
do
stand
in
a
sunny
doorway
in
that
linen
dress
of
yours
i
am
going
to
ride
every
woman
should
ride
it
good
for
the
liver
i
think
she
rather
wavered
when
they
brought
the
horse
which
looked
larger
than
usual
and
had
a
roman
nose
the
instructor
handed
tish
four
lines
and
she
grabbed
them
nervously
in
a
bunch
just
a
moment
said
the
instructor
and
slipped
a
line
between
each
two
of
her
fingers
tish
looked
rather
startled
when
i
used
to
ride
she
began
with
dignity
but
the
instructor
only
smiled
these
two
are
for
the
curb
he
said
if
he
bolts
or
anything
like
that
you
know
whoa
viper
still
old
man
viper
tish
repeated
clutching
at
the
lines
is
is
he
er
nasty
not
a
bit
of
it
said
the
instructor
while
he
prepared
to
hoist
her
up
he
as
gentle
as
a
woman
to
the
people
he
likes
his
only
fault
is
that
he
apt
to
take
a
little
nip
out
of
the
stablemen
now
and
then
he
very
fond
of
ladies
humph
said
tish
he
looking
at
me
rather
strangely
do
you
think
has
he
been
fed
lately
perhaps
he
sees
that
divided
skirt
i
suggested
tish
gave
me
one
look
and
got
on
the
horse
they
walked
round
the
ring
at
first
and
tish
seemed
to
like
it
then
a
stableman
put
a
nickel
into
a
and
that
seemed
to
be
a
signal
for
the
thing
to
trot
tish
said
afterward
that
she
never
hit
the
horse
back
twice
in
the
same
place
once
she
says
she
came
down
on
his
neck
and
several
times
she
was
back
somewhere
about
his
tail
every
time
she
landed
wherever
it
might
be
he
gave
a
heave
and
sent
her
up
again
she
tried
to
say
whoa
but
it
came
out
in
pieces
so
to
speak
and
the
creature
seemed
to
be
encouraged
by
it
and
took
to
going
faster
by
that
time
she
said
she
was
coming
down
at
all
but
was
in
the
air
all
the
time
with
the
horse
coming
up
at
the
rate
of
fifty
revolutions
a
second
she
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
keep
her
mouth
shut
so
she
would
bite
her
tongue
off
after
four
times
round
the
music
stopped
and
the
horse
did
also
they
were
just
in
front
of
us
and
tish
looked
rather
dazed
you
did
splendidly
said
aggie
honestly
tish
i
was
frightened
at
first
but
you
and
that
dear
horse
seemed
one
piece
did
they
lizzie
tish
straightened
out
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
with
her
right
and
extricated
the
lines
then
she
turned
her
head
slowly
from
right
to
left
to
see
if
she
could
help
me
down
somebody
she
said
in
a
thin
voice
and
call
an
osteopath
there
is
something
wrong
with
my
spine
she
was
in
bed
three
days
having
massage
and
a
vibrator
and
being
rubbed
with
chloroform
liniment
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
offered
me
her
divided
skirt
but
i
refused
riding
would
be
good
for
your
liver
lizzie
she
said
sitting
up
in
bed
with
pillows
all
about
her
i
do
intend
to
detach
it
to
do
it
good
i
retorted
what
your
liver
and
mine
and
most
of
the
other
livers
need
these
days
is
to
be
sent
out
in
a
divided
skirt
and
beaten
to
a
jelly
they
need
rest
less
food
and
simpler
food
if
instead
of
taking
your
liver
on
a
horse
put
it
in
a
tent
and
feed
it
nuts
and
berries
you
would
be
the
color
you
are
tish
carberry
that
really
started
the
whole
thing
although
at
the
time
tish
said
nothing
she
has
a
way
of
getting
an
idea
and
letting
it
simmer
on
the
back
of
her
brain
as
you
may
say
when
nobody
knows
it
been
cooking
at
all
and
then
suddenly
bringing
it
out
cooked
and
seasoned
and
ready
to
serve
on
the
day
tish
sat
up
for
the
first
time
aggie
and
i
went
over
to
see
her
hannah
the
maid
had
got
her
out
of
bed
to
a
window
and
tish
was
sitting
there
with
books
all
about
her
it
is
in
times
of
enforced
physical
idleness
that
most
of
tish
ideas
come
to
her
and
aggie
had
reminded
me
of
that
fact
on
the
way
over
you
remember
lizzie
she
said
how
last
winter
when
she
was
getting
over
the
grippe
she
took
up
that
course
in
swimming
she
reading
watch
her
books
it
probably
be
suffrage
or
airships
tish
always
believes
anything
she
reads
she
had
been
quite
sure
she
could
swim
after
six
correspondence
lessons
she
had
all
the
movements
exactly
and
had
worried
her
trained
nurse
almost
into
hysteria
for
a
week
by
turning
on
her
face
in
bed
every
now
and
then
and
trying
the
overhand
stroke
she
got
very
expert
and
had
decided
she
swim
regularly
and
even
had
charlie
sands
show
her
the
australian
crawl
business
so
she
could
go
over
some
time
and
swim
the
channel
it
was
a
matter
of
breathing
and
of
changing
positions
she
said
and
was
up
to
intelligence
rather
than
muscle
then
when
she
was
quite
strong
she
had
gone
to
the
natatorium
aggie
and
i
went
along
not
that
we
were
any
good
in
emergency
but
because
tish
had
convinced
us
there
would
be
no
emergency
and
tish
went
in
at
the
deep
end
of
the
pool
head
first
according
to
diagram
and
not
come
well
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
threatening
in
what
tish
was
reading
this
time
she
had
ordered
some
books
for
maria
lee
children
and
was
looking
them
over
before
she
sent
them
the
young
was
one
and
camper
craft
was
another
how
i
shudder
when
i
recall
those
names
aggie
had
baked
an
angel
cake
and
i
had
brought
over
a
jar
of
cookies
but
tish
only
thanked
us
and
asked
hannah
to
take
them
out
even
then
we
were
not
suspicious
tish
sat
back
among
her
pillows
and
said
very
little
the
conversation
was
something
like
this
well
you
up
again
i
hope
to
goodness
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
if
you
do
mind
i
like
hannah
to
cut
that
cake
it
fell
in
the
middle
do
you
know
that
the
indians
never
sweetened
their
food
and
that
they
developed
absolutely
perfect
teeth
well
they
never
had
any
automobiles
either
but
they
develop
wings
do
you
want
that
window
closed
i
in
a
draft
air
in
motion
never
gave
any
one
a
cold
we
do
not
catch
cold
we
catch
heat
it
ridiculous
the
way
we
shut
ourselves
up
in
houses
and
expect
to
remain
well
well
catchig
sobethig
the
would
you
like
me
to
help
you
dress
it
might
rest
your
back
to
have
your
corset
on
i
shall
never
wear
a
corset
again
why
did
the
iddiads
wear
theb
tish
is
very
sensitive
to
lack
of
sympathy
and
she
shut
up
like
a
clam
she
was
coldly
polite
to
us
for
the
remainder
of
our
visit
but
she
did
not
again
refer
to
the
indians
which
in
itself
was
suspicious
fortunately
for
us
or
unfortunately
tish
new
scheme
was
one
she
could
not
very
well
carry
out
alone
i
believe
she
tried
to
induce
hannah
to
go
with
her
and
only
when
hannah
failed
her
did
she
turn
to
us
hannah
was
frightened
and
came
to
warn
us
i
remember
the
occasion
very
well
it
was
wiggins
birthday
anniversary
and
we
usually
dine
at
aggie
and
have
a
cake
with
thirty
candles
on
it
tish
was
not
yet
able
to
be
about
so
aggie
and
i
ate
together
she
always
likes
to
sit
until
the
last
candle
is
burned
out
which
is
rather
dispiriting
and
always
leaves
me
low
in
my
mind
just
as
it
flickered
and
went
out
hannah
came
in
miss
tish
sent
over
charlie
letter
from
london
said
hannah
and
put
it
in
front
of
aggie
then
she
sat
down
on
a
chair
and
commenced
to
cry
why
hannah
said
aggie
what
in
the
world
has
happened
she
off
again
sniveled
hannah
and
she
worse
this
time
than
ever
been
no
sugar
no
tea
only
nuts
and
fruit
and
her
windows
open
all
night
with
the
curtains
getting
black
i
wisht
i
had
charlie
by
the
neck
i
suppose
it
came
over
both
of
us
at
the
same
time
the
young
woodsman
and
the
camper
craft
and
no
stays
and
all
that
i
reached
for
charlie
sands
letter
which
was
always
sent
to
tish
and
meant
for
all
of
us
he
wrote
three
of
a
well
the
french
president
has
came
and
went
and
london
has
taken
down
all
the
brilliant
flags
which
greeted
him
such
tactful
bits
as
bore
cressy
and
agincourt
and
the
pretty
little
smallpox
and
plague
here
banners
and
has
gone
back
to
such
innocent
diversions
as
baiting
cabinet
ministers
blowing
up
public
buildings
or
going
out
into
the
woods
seeking
the
simple
life
the
simple
lifers
travel
in
bands
and
little
else
they
go
barefooted
barearmed
bareheaded
and
barenecked
they
wear
one
garment
i
believe
let
their
hair
hang
and
their
beards
grow
eat
only
what
nature
provides
such
as
nuts
and
fruits
sleep
under
the
stars
and
drink
from
nature
pools
rather
bully
is
it
they
a
handsome
lot
generally
brown
as
nuts
and
i
saw
a
girl
yesterday
well
if
you
do
not
hear
from
me
for
a
time
it
will
be
because
i
have
discarded
the
pockets
in
which
i
carry
my
fountain
pen
and
my
stamps
and
am
wandering
barefoot
through
the
elysian
fields
yours
for
the
simple
life
charlie
sands
as
i
finished
reading
the
letter
aloud
i
looked
at
aggie
in
dismay
that
settles
it
i
said
hopelessly
she
had
some
such
idea
before
and
now
this
young
idiot
i
stopped
and
stared
across
the
table
at
aggie
she
was
sitting
rapt
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
smouldering
wicks
of
wiggins
candles
barefoot
through
the
elysian
fields
she
said
ii
i
am
not
trying
to
defend
myself
i
never
had
the
enthusiasm
of
the
other
two
but
i
rather
liked
the
idea
and
i
did
restrain
them
it
was
my
suggestion
for
instance
that
we
wear
sandals
without
stockings
instead
of
going
in
our
bare
feet
which
was
a
good
thing
for
the
first
day
out
aggie
stepped
into
a
hornet
nest
and
i
made
out
the
lists
the
idea
of
course
is
not
how
much
one
can
carry
but
how
little
the
young
woodsman
told
exactly
how
to
manage
in
the
woods
if
one
were
lost
there
and
had
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
bootlace
and
a
wire
hairpin
with
the
hairpin
one
could
easily
make
a
fair
and
with
a
bootlace
or
a
good
hemp
cord
one
could
make
a
rabbit
snare
so
you
see
tish
explained
there
fish
and
meat
with
no
trouble
at
all
and
there
will
be
berries
and
nuts
that
a
diet
for
a
king
i
was
making
a
list
of
the
necessaries
at
the
time
and
under
bootlaces
and
hairpins
i
put
down
spade
what
in
heaven
name
is
the
spade
for
tish
demanded
you
got
to
dig
bait
have
you
tish
eyed
me
with
disgust
grasshoppers
she
said
tersely
there
was
really
nothing
tish
was
not
prepared
for
i
should
never
have
thought
of
grasshoppers
the
idea
is
simply
this
observed
tish
we
have
surrounded
ourselves
with
a
thousand
and
one
things
we
do
not
need
and
would
be
better
without
houses
foolish
clothing
electric
light
idiotic
servants
hannah
get
away
from
that
door
rich
foods
furniture
and
crowds
of
people
we
developed
and
cared
for
our
bodies
instead
of
our
souls
what
we
want
is
to
get
out
into
the
woods
and
think
to
forget
those
pampered
bodies
of
ours
and
to
let
our
souls
grow
and
assert
themselves
we
decided
finally
to
take
a
blanket
apiece
rolled
on
our
shoulders
and
tish
and
i
each
took
a
strong
knife
aggie
instead
of
the
knife
took
a
pair
of
scissors
we
took
a
small
bottle
of
blackberry
cordial
for
emergencies
a
cake
of
soap
a
for
seasoning
the
fish
and
rabbits
two
towels
a
package
of
aggie
remedy
a
bottle
of
oil
of
pennyroyal
to
use
against
mosquitoes
and
a
large
piece
of
canvas
light
but
strong
cut
like
the
diagram
illustration
tish
said
it
was
the
regulation
indian
tepee
and
that
a
squaw
could
set
one
up
in
an
hour
and
have
dinner
cooked
inside
it
in
thirty
minutes
after
she
said
she
guessed
we
could
do
it
if
an
indian
squaw
could
and
that
after
we
cut
the
poles
once
we
could
carry
them
with
us
if
we
wished
to
move
she
said
the
tent
ought
to
be
ornamented
but
she
had
had
no
time
and
we
could
paint
designs
on
it
with
colored
clay
in
the
woods
when
we
had
nothing
more
important
to
do
it
made
a
largish
bundle
but
we
did
not
intend
to
travel
much
we
thought
we
could
find
a
good
place
by
a
lake
somewhere
and
put
up
the
tent
and
set
a
few
snares
and
locate
the
nearest
and
and
then
while
the
rabbits
were
catching
themselves
we
should
have
time
to
get
acquainted
with
our
souls
again
tish
put
it
in
her
terse
manner
most
intelligently
we
intend
to
prove
she
stated
to
ostermaier
the
minister
wife
who
came
to
call
and
found
us
all
sitting
on
the
floor
trying
to
get
used
to
it
for
of
course
there
would
be
no
chairs
we
shall
prove
that
the
trappings
of
civilization
are
a
delusion
and
a
snare
we
shall
bring
back
sana
in
corpore
sano
the
minister
wife
thought
this
was
a
disease
for
she
said
i
hope
not
i
sure
very
hastily
we
shall
make
our
own
fire
and
our
own
shelter
said
tish
from
the
floor
we
shall
wear
one
garment
loose
enough
to
allow
entire
freedom
of
movement
we
shall
bathe
in
nature
pools
and
come
out
cleansed
on
the
sabbath
we
shall
attend
divine
service
under
the
gothic
arches
of
the
trees
read
sermons
in
stones
and
instead
of
that
whining
tenor
in
the
choir
we
shall
listen
to
the
birds
singing
praise
overhead
ostermaier
looked
rather
bewildered
i
sure
i
hope
so
she
said
vaguely
i
do
like
camping
myself
there
are
so
many
bugs
as
tish
said
some
ideas
are
so
large
that
the
average
person
can
not
see
them
at
all
we
had
fixed
on
maine
it
seemed
to
combine
all
the
necessary
qualities
woods
and
lakes
rabbits
game
and
fish
and
solitude
besides
aggie
hay
fever
is
better
the
farther
north
she
gets
on
the
day
we
were
leaving
ostermaier
came
to
see
us
i
i
really
must
protest
ladies
he
said
that
sort
of
thing
may
be
all
right
for
savages
but
are
we
not
as
intelligent
as
savages
tish
demanded
primitive
people
are
inured
to
hardships
and
besides
they
have
methods
of
their
own
they
can
make
fire
so
can
i
retorted
tish
any
fool
can
make
a
fire
with
a
it
been
done
in
seconds
if
you
would
only
take
some
matches
he
wailed
and
a
good
revolver
miss
letitia
and
you
must
pardon
this
but
i
have
your
at
heart
if
i
could
persuade
you
to
take
along
some
er
flannels
and
warm
clothing
clothing
said
tish
loftily
is
a
matter
of
habit
mr
ostermaier
i
think
he
got
the
idea
from
this
that
we
intended
to
discard
clothing
altogether
for
he
went
away
almost
immediately
looking
rather
upset
and
he
preached
on
the
following
sunday
from
consider
the
lilies
of
the
field
even
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these
we
left
on
monday
evening
and
by
tuesday
at
noon
we
were
at
our
destination
as
far
as
the
railroad
was
concerned
tish
had
a
map
with
the
lake
we
picked
out
and
we
had
figured
that
we
drive
out
to
within
ten
miles
or
so
of
it
and
then
send
the
driver
back
the
lake
was
in
an
uninhabited
neighborhood
with
the
nearest
town
miles
away
we
had
one
suitcase
containing
our
blankets
sandals
short
dresses
soap
hairpins
knives
scissors
and
a
compass
and
the
leather
thongs
for
rabbit
snares
that
we
had
had
cut
at
a
harness
shop
in
the
other
suitcase
was
the
tepee
we
ate
a
substantial
breakfast
at
tish
suggestion
because
we
expected
to
be
fairly
busy
the
first
day
and
there
would
be
no
time
for
hunting
we
had
to
walk
ten
miles
set
up
the
tent
make
a
fire
and
gather
nuts
and
berries
it
was
about
that
time
i
think
that
i
happened
to
recall
that
it
was
early
for
nuts
still
there
would
be
berries
and
tish
had
added
mushrooms
to
our
menu
we
found
a
man
with
a
spring
wagon
to
drive
us
out
and
tish
showed
him
the
map
i
guess
i
can
get
you
out
that
way
he
said
but
i
ai
heard
of
no
camp
up
that
direction
who
said
anything
about
a
camp
snapped
tish
how
much
to
drive
us
fifteen
miles
in
that
direction
fifteen
miles
well
about
five
dollars
but
i
think
how
much
to
drive
us
fifteen
miles
without
thinking
ten
dollars
said
the
man
and
as
he
had
the
only
wagon
in
the
town
we
had
to
pay
it
it
was
a
lovely
day
although
very
warm
the
morning
sun
turned
the
woods
to
fairylike
glades
tish
sat
on
the
front
seat
erect
and
staring
ahead
aggie
bent
over
and
touched
my
arm
lightly
is
she
wonderful
she
whispered
like
some
adventurer
of
old
balboa
discovering
the
pacific
ocean
or
joan
of
arc
leading
the
but
somehow
my
enthusiasm
was
dying
the
sun
was
hot
and
there
were
no
to
be
seen
aggie
fairy
glades
in
the
woods
were
filled
not
with
dancing
sprites
but
with
gnats
i
wanted
a
glass
of
iced
tea
and
some
chicken
salad
and
talcum
powder
down
my
neck
the
road
was
bad
and
the
driver
seemed
to
have
a
joke
to
himself
for
every
now
and
then
he
chuckled
and
kept
his
eyes
on
the
woods
on
each
side
as
if
he
expected
to
see
something
his
manner
puzzled
us
all
you
can
trust
me
not
to
say
anything
ladies
he
said
at
last
but
do
you
think
you
playing
it
a
bit
low
down
this
ai
quite
up
to
contract
is
it
you
been
drinking
said
tish
shortly
after
that
he
let
her
alone
but
soon
after
he
turned
round
to
me
and
made
another
venture
in
case
you
need
grub
lady
he
said
and
them
two
suitcases
hold
a
lot
i
bring
out
anything
you
say
eggs
and
butter
and
garden
truck
at
market
prices
i
no
phylanthropist
he
said
glaring
at
tish
but
i
be
glad
to
help
the
girl
and
that
the
truth
i
been
married
to
this
here
wife
o
mine
quite
a
spell
and
to
my
first
one
for
twenty
years
and
i
a
believer
in
married
life
what
girl
i
asked
he
turned
right
round
in
the
seat
and
winked
at
me
all
right
he
said
i
not
butt
in
unless
you
need
me
but
i
like
to
know
one
thing
he
has
got
a
mother
he
says
so
i
take
it
his
aunts
am
i
on
ladies
we
did
know
what
he
was
talking
about
and
we
said
so
but
he
only
smiled
a
mile
or
so
from
our
destination
the
horse
scared
up
a
rabbit
and
tish
could
hardly
be
restrained
from
running
after
it
with
a
leather
thong
aggie
however
turned
a
little
pale
i
never
be
able
to
eat
one
never
she
confided
to
me
did
you
see
its
eyes
lizzie
do
you
remember
wiggins
eyes
and
the
way
he
used
to
move
his
nose
just
like
that
at
the
end
of
fifteen
miles
the
driver
drew
up
his
horses
and
took
a
fresh
chew
of
tobacco
i
guess
this
is
about
right
he
said
that
trail
there
take
you
to
the
lake
how
long
do
you
reckon
it
be
before
you
need
some
fresh
eggs
we
are
quite
able
to
look
after
ourselves
said
tish
with
hauteur
and
got
out
of
the
wagon
she
paid
him
off
at
once
and
sat
down
on
her
suitcase
until
he
had
driven
out
of
sight
he
drove
slowly
looking
back
every
now
and
then
and
his
last
view
of
us
must
have
been
impressive
three
and
determined
women
ready
to
conquer
the
wilderness
as
tish
put
it
and
two
suitcases
it
was
as
solitary
a
place
as
we
could
have
wished
we
had
not
seen
a
house
in
ten
miles
and
when
the
last
creak
of
the
wagon
had
died
away
there
was
a
silence
that
made
our
ears
fairly
ache
tish
waited
until
the
wagon
was
out
of
sight
then
she
stood
up
and
threw
out
her
arms
at
last
she
said
free
to
have
a
lodge
in
some
vast
wilderness
to
think
to
breathe
to
expand
lizzie
do
you
suppose
if
we
go
back
we
can
get
that
rabbit
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
one
and
there
was
not
a
in
sight
the
drive
had
made
me
hungry
and
i
have
eaten
a
rabbit
that
looked
like
wiggins
and
called
me
by
name
if
i
had
it
but
there
was
absolutely
no
use
going
back
for
the
one
we
seen
on
our
drive
aggie
was
opening
her
suitcase
and
getting
out
her
costume
which
was
a
blue
calico
with
short
sleeves
and
a
skirt
where
i
put
it
on
she
asked
looking
about
her
right
here
tish
replied
for
goodness
sake
aggie
try
to
discard
false
modesty
and
false
shame
we
here
to
get
close
to
the
great
beating
heart
of
nature
take
off
your
switch
before
you
do
another
thing
none
of
us
looked
particularly
well
i
admit
but
it
was
wonderful
how
much
more
comfortable
we
were
aggie
who
is
very
thin
discarded
a
part
of
her
figure
and
each
of
us
parted
with
some
pet
hypocrisy
but
i
do
know
that
i
have
ever
felt
better
only
of
course
we
were
hungry
we
packed
our
things
in
the
suitcases
and
hid
them
in
a
hollow
tree
and
tish
suggested
looking
for
a
spring
she
said
water
was
always
the
first
requisite
and
fire
the
second
fire
said
aggie
what
for
we
nothing
to
cook
well
that
was
true
enough
so
we
sent
aggie
to
look
for
water
and
tish
and
i
made
a
rabbit
snare
we
made
a
good
many
snares
and
got
to
be
rather
quick
at
it
they
were
all
made
like
this
illustration
illustration
first
tish
with
her
book
open
in
front
of
her
made
a
running
noose
out
of
one
of
the
buckskin
thongs
next
we
bent
down
a
sapling
and
tied
the
noose
to
it
and
last
of
all
we
bound
the
free
part
of
the
thong
round
a
snag
and
thus
held
the
sapling
down
the
idea
is
that
a
rabbit
bounding
along
presumably
with
his
eyes
shut
will
stick
his
head
through
the
noose
kick
the
line
clear
of
the
snag
and
be
drawn
violently
into
the
air
tish
figured
that
by
putting
up
half
a
dozen
snares
we
have
three
or
four
rabbits
at
least
each
day
it
was
about
three
when
we
finished
and
we
drew
off
to
a
safe
distance
to
watch
the
rabbit
bound
to
his
doom
but
no
rabbits
came
along
i
was
very
empty
and
rather
faint
but
tish
said
she
had
never
been
able
to
think
so
clearly
and
that
we
were
all
overfed
and
stodgy
and
would
be
better
for
fasting
aggie
came
in
at
with
a
hornet
sting
and
no
water
she
said
there
were
no
springs
but
that
she
had
found
a
place
where
a
spring
had
existed
before
the
dry
spell
and
there
was
a
naked
footprint
in
the
mud
quite
fresh
we
all
went
to
look
at
it
and
tish
was
quite
positive
it
was
not
a
man
footprint
at
all
but
only
a
bear
a
bear
said
aggie
what
of
it
tish
demanded
the
woodsman
says
that
no
bear
attacks
a
human
unless
he
is
hungry
and
at
this
time
of
the
year
with
the
woods
full
of
food
humph
i
could
not
restrain
myself
i
wish
you
would
show
me
a
little
of
it
if
no
rabbit
with
acute
melancholia
comes
along
to
commit
suicide
by
hanging
on
that
gallows
of
yours
i
think
we
starve
to
death
there
will
be
a
rabbit
tish
said
tersely
and
we
started
back
to
the
snare
i
was
never
so
astonished
in
my
life
there
was
a
rabbit
it
seems
we
had
struck
a
runway
without
knowing
it
although
tish
said
afterward
that
she
had
recognized
it
at
once
from
the
rabbit
tracks
anyhow
whether
it
died
of
design
or
curiosity
our
supper
was
kicking
at
the
top
of
the
sapling
and
tish
pretended
to
be
calm
and
to
have
known
all
along
that
we
get
one
but
it
was
not
dead
we
got
it
down
somehow
or
other
and
i
held
it
by
the
ears
while
it
kicked
and
scratched
i
was
hungry
enough
to
have
eaten
it
alive
but
aggie
began
to
cry
you
be
murderers
nothing
else
she
wailed
look
at
his
little
white
tail
and
pitiful
baby
eyes
good
gracious
aggie
tish
snapped
get
a
knife
and
cut
its
throat
while
i
make
a
fire
if
it
any
help
to
you
we
not
going
to
eat
either
its
little
white
tail
or
its
pitiful
baby
eyes
as
a
matter
of
fact
aggie
would
touch
the
rabbit
and
i
did
not
care
much
about
it
myself
i
do
not
like
to
kill
things
my
aunt
sarah
mackintosh
once
killed
a
white
hen
that
lived
twenty
minutes
without
its
head
two
weeks
later
she
dreamed
that
that
same
hen
without
a
head
was
sitting
on
the
footboard
of
the
bed
and
the
next
day
she
got
word
that
her
cousin
husband
in
sacramento
had
died
of
the
hiccoughs
it
ended
with
tish
giving
me
the
materials
and
stalking
off
into
the
woods
with
the
rabbit
in
one
hand
and
the
knife
in
the
other
illustration
it
ended
with
tish
stalking
off
into
the
woods
with
the
rabbit
in
one
hand
and
the
knife
in
the
other
tish
is
nothing
if
not
thorough
but
she
seemed
to
me
inconsistent
she
brought
blankets
and
a
canvas
tepee
and
sandals
and
an
aluminum
kettle
but
she
disdained
matches
i
rubbed
with
that
silly
drill
and
a
sort
of
bow
arrangement
until
my
wrists
ached
but
i
did
not
get
even
a
spark
of
fire
when
tish
came
back
with
the
rabbit
there
was
no
fire
and
aggie
had
taken
out
her
watch
crystal
and
was
holding
it
in
the
sun
over
a
pile
of
leaves
tish
got
out
the
young
woodsman
from
the
suitcase
it
seems
i
had
followed
cuts
i
and
ii
but
had
neglected
cut
iii
which
is
hold
the
left
wrist
against
the
left
shin
and
the
left
foot
on
the
fireblock
i
had
got
my
feet
mixed
and
was
trying
to
hold
my
left
wrist
against
my
right
shin
which
is
exceedingly
difficult
tish
got
a
fire
in
fourteen
minutes
and
seconds
by
aggie
watch
and
had
to
wear
a
bandage
on
her
hand
for
a
week
but
we
had
a
fire
we
cooked
the
rabbit
which
proved
to
be
much
older
than
aggie
had
thought
and
ate
what
we
could
personally
i
am
not
fond
of
rabbit
and
our
enjoyment
was
rather
chastened
by
the
fear
that
some
mushrooms
tish
had
collected
and
added
to
the
stew
were
toadstools
to
make
things
worse
aggie
saw
some
goldenrod
nearby
and
began
to
sneeze
it
was
after
five
but
it
seemed
wisest
to
move
on
toward
the
lake
even
if
we
do
make
it
said
tish
we
be
on
our
way
and
while
that
bear
is
likely
harmless
we
need
thrust
temptation
in
his
way
we
carried
the
fire
with
us
in
the
kettle
and
we
took
turns
with
the
tepee
which
was
heavy
our
suitcases
with
our
city
clothes
in
them
we
hid
in
a
hollow
tree
and
one
after
the
other
with
aggie
last
we
started
on
the
trail
which
was
a
sort
of
wide
wagon
road
at
first
became
a
footpath
as
we
went
on
even
that
disappeared
at
times
under
fallen
leaves
once
we
lost
it
entirely
and
aggie
falling
over
a
hidden
root
stilled
the
fire
she
became
exceedingly
disagreeable
at
about
that
time
said
she
was
sure
tish
mushrooms
were
toadstools
because
she
felt
very
queer
and
suddenly
gave
a
yell
and
said
she
had
seen
something
moving
in
the
bushes
we
all
looked
and
the
bushes
were
moving
iii
it
was
dusk
by
that
time
and
the
path
was
only
a
thread
between
masses
of
undergrowth
tish
said
if
it
was
the
bear
he
would
be
afraid
of
the
fire
so
we
put
dry
leaves
in
the
kettle
and
made
quite
a
blaze
by
its
light
tish
read
that
bears
in
the
summer
are
full
fed
and
really
frolicsome
and
that
they
are
awful
cowards
we
felt
quite
cheered
and
brave
and
tish
said
if
he
came
near
to
throw
the
fire
kettle
at
him
and
he
probably
die
of
fright
it
was
too
late
to
put
up
the
tepee
so
we
found
a
clearing
near
the
path
and
decided
to
spend
the
night
there
aggie
still
watched
the
bushes
and
wanted
to
spend
the
night
in
a
tree
but
tish
calmness
was
a
reproach
to
us
both
and
after
we
had
emptied
the
kettle
and
made
quite
a
fire
to
keep
off
animals
we
unrolled
our
blankets
and
prepared
for
sleep
i
could
have
slept
anywhere
although
i
was
still
rather
hungry
my
last
view
was
of
tish
in
the
firelight
grimly
bending
down
a
sapling
and
fastening
a
rabbit
snare
to
it
during
the
night
i
was
wakened
by
somebody
clutching
my
arm
it
was
aggie
who
lay
next
to
me
when
i
raised
my
head
she
pointed
off
into
the
woods
to
our
left
at
a
height
of
perhaps
four
feet
from
the
ground
a
ghastly
red
glow
was
moving
rapidly
away
from
us
it
was
not
a
torch
it
was
more
a
radiance
and
it
moved
not
evenly
but
jerkily
i
could
feel
the
very
hair
rising
on
my
head
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
call
tish
when
we
had
roused
her
however
the
glow
had
faded
entirely
and
she
said
we
had
had
a
nightmare
the
snare
the
next
morning
contained
a
skunk
and
we
moved
on
as
quickly
as
possible
without
attempting
to
secure
the
thong
of
which
we
had
several
we
gathered
some
puffballs
to
soak
for
breakfast
and
in
a
clearing
i
found
some
blackberry
bushes
we
were
very
cheerful
that
morning
for
if
we
could
capture
rabbits
and
skunks
we
were
sure
of
other
things
also
and
soon
we
would
be
able
to
add
fish
to
our
menu
true
we
had
not
had
much
time
to
commune
with
our
souls
and
arms
were
so
sunburned
that
she
could
not
bend
them
at
the
elbows
but
as
tish
said
we
had
already
proved
our
contention
that
we
could
get
along
without
men
or
houses
or
things
things
she
said
were
the
curse
of
modern
life
we
filled
our
lives
with
things
instead
of
thoughts
it
was
when
we
were
ready
to
cook
the
puffballs
that
we
missed
the
kettle
tish
was
very
angry
she
said
it
was
evident
that
the
bear
was
mischievous
and
that
all
bears
were
thieves
see
the
young
woodsman
but
i
recalled
the
glow
of
the
night
before
and
more
than
once
i
caught
aggie
eyes
on
me
filled
with
consternation
for
we
had
seen
that
kettle
leaving
the
camp
with
some
of
our
fire
in
it
and
bears
are
afraid
of
fire
we
reached
the
lake
at
noon
and
it
seemed
as
if
we
might
soon
have
time
to
sit
down
and
rest
but
there
was
a
great
deal
to
do
aggie
was
of
no
assistance
on
account
of
her
arms
so
tish
and
i
put
up
the
tent
the
young
woodsman
said
it
was
easy
first
you
tied
three
long
poles
together
near
the
top
and
stood
them
up
so
they
made
a
sort
of
triangle
then
you
cut
about
a
dozen
and
filled
in
between
the
three
that
looked
easy
but
it
took
an
afternoon
and
our
first
three
looked
like
this
first
cut
illustration
as
the
first
three
looked
as
they
should
have
looked
we
had
caught
a
rabbit
by
noon
and
aggie
being
unfit
for
other
work
and
the
kettle
being
gone
tish
set
her
to
roasting
it
it
was
not
very
good
but
we
ate
some
being
ravenous
the
method
was
simplicity
itself
two
forked
sticks
in
the
ground
one
across
to
hang
the
rabbit
to
and
a
fire
beneath
it
tasted
rather
smoky
in
the
afternoon
we
finished
putting
up
the
tepee
and
tish
made
a
fishhook
out
of
a
hairpin
and
tied
it
to
a
strong
creeper
i
had
found
but
we
caught
no
fish
we
had
more
rabbit
for
supper
with
some
puffballs
smoked
and
a
few
huckleberries
but
by
that
time
the
very
sight
of
a
rabbit
sickened
me
and
aggie
began
to
talk
about
broiled
beefsteak
and
fried
spring
chicken
we
had
seen
no
sign
of
the
bear
or
whatever
it
was
all
day
and
it
seemed
likely
we
were
not
to
be
again
disturbed
but
a
most
mysterious
thing
occurred
that
very
night
as
i
have
said
we
had
caught
no
fish
the
lake
was
full
of
them
we
sat
on
a
bank
that
evening
and
watched
them
playing
leapfrog
and
talked
about
frying
them
on
stones
but
nothing
came
near
the
hairpin
at
last
tish
made
a
suggestion
we
need
worms
she
said
a
grasshopper
loses
all
his
spirit
after
he
been
immersed
for
an
hour
but
a
worm
will
keep
on
wriggling
and
attracting
attention
for
half
a
day
i
wanted
to
bring
a
spade
said
i
but
tish
had
read
of
a
scheme
for
getting
worms
that
she
said
the
game
warden
of
some
place
or
other
had
guaranteed
officially
you
stick
a
piece
of
wood
about
two
feet
into
the
ground
in
a
likely
spot
she
said
and
rub
a
rough
piece
of
bark
or
plank
across
the
top
this
man
claims
and
it
sounds
reasonable
that
the
worms
think
it
is
raining
and
come
up
for
water
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
gather
them
up
tish
found
a
pole
for
the
purpose
on
the
beach
and
set
to
work
while
aggie
and
i
prepared
several
hooks
and
lines
the
fish
were
jumping
busily
and
it
seemed
likely
we
should
have
more
than
we
could
do
to
haul
them
in
the
experiment
however
failed
entirely
for
not
a
single
worm
appeared
tish
laid
it
to
the
fact
that
it
was
very
late
and
that
the
worms
were
probably
settled
down
for
the
night
it
may
have
been
that
or
it
may
have
been
the
wrong
kind
of
wood
the
mysterious
happening
was
this
we
rose
quite
early
because
the
tepee
did
not
seem
to
be
well
anchored
and
fell
down
on
us
at
daybreak
tish
went
down
to
the
beach
to
examine
the
lines
that
had
been
out
all
night
and
found
nothing
she
was
returning
rather
dispirited
to
tell
us
that
it
would
be
rabbit
again
for
breakfast
when
she
saw
lying
on
a
flat
stone
half
a
dozen
beautiful
fish
one
or
two
still
gasping
in
our
lost
kettle
tish
said
she
stood
there
opening
and
shutting
her
mouth
like
the
fish
then
she
gave
a
whoop
and
we
came
running
at
first
we
thought
they
might
have
been
jumping
and
leaped
out
on
to
the
beach
by
accident
but
as
tish
said
they
would
hardly
have
landed
all
together
and
into
a
kettle
that
had
been
lost
for
two
nights
and
a
day
the
queer
thing
was
that
they
had
not
been
caught
with
a
hook
at
all
they
had
a
mark
on
them
we
were
so
hungry
that
we
ate
every
one
of
them
for
breakfast
it
was
only
when
we
had
eaten
and
were
sitting
gorged
and
not
caring
whether
the
tent
was
set
up
again
or
not
that
we
fell
to
wondering
about
the
fish
tish
fancied
it
might
have
been
the
driver
of
the
spring
wagon
but
decided
he
have
sold
us
the
fish
at
thirty
cents
a
pound
live
weight
all
day
long
we
watched
for
a
sign
of
our
benefactor
but
we
saw
nothing
tish
set
up
more
rabbit
snares
not
that
she
wanted
rabbits
but
it
had
become
a
mania
with
her
and
there
were
so
many
of
them
that
as
they
grew
accustomed
to
us
they
sat
round
our
camp
in
a
ring
and
criticized
our
housekeeping
she
thought
if
she
got
a
good
many
skins
she
could
have
a
fur
robe
made
for
her
automobile
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
found
another
use
for
them
it
was
that
night
then
that
we
were
sitting
round
the
on
stones
that
we
had
brought
up
from
the
beach
we
had
seen
nothing
more
of
the
bear
and
if
we
had
been
asked
we
should
have
said
that
the
nearest
human
being
was
miles
away
suddenly
a
voice
came
out
of
the
woods
just
behind
us
a
man
voice
please
do
be
alarmed
said
the
voice
but
may
i
have
a
little
of
your
fire
mine
has
gone
out
again
gracious
said
aggie
get
your
revolver
this
was
for
effect
tish
had
no
revolver
all
of
us
had
turned
and
were
staring
into
the
woods
behind
but
we
could
see
no
one
after
aggie
speech
about
the
revolver
it
was
some
time
before
the
voice
spoke
again
never
mind
aggie
tish
observed
very
loud
the
revolver
is
here
and
loaded
as
nice
a
little
as
any
one
needs
here
in
the
woods
she
said
afterward
that
she
knew
all
the
time
there
was
no
caliber
revolver
but
in
the
excitement
she
got
it
mixed
with
her
bust
measure
having
replied
to
aggie
tish
then
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
do
skulk
back
there
she
called
come
out
where
we
can
see
you
if
you
look
reliable
we
give
you
some
fire
of
course
there
was
another
pause
as
if
the
stranger
were
hesitating
then
i
think
i
better
not
he
said
with
reluctance
in
his
voice
you
toss
a
brand
this
way
by
that
time
we
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
darkness
and
i
thought
i
could
see
in
the
shadow
of
a
tree
a
lightish
figure
aggie
saw
it
at
the
same
instant
and
clutched
my
arm
lizzie
she
gasped
it
was
at
that
moment
that
tish
tossed
the
brand
it
fell
far
short
but
her
movement
caught
the
stranger
unawares
he
ducked
behind
the
tree
but
the
flare
of
light
had
caught
him
with
the
exception
of
what
looked
like
a
pair
of
he
was
as
bare
as
my
hand
there
was
a
sort
of
astonished
silence
then
the
voice
called
out
why
in
the
world
did
you
warn
me
it
said
aggrieved
i
did
know
you
were
going
to
throw
the
blamed
thing
we
had
all
turned
our
backs
at
once
and
tish
face
was
awful
take
it
and
go
she
said
without
turning
take
it
and
go
from
the
crackling
of
leaves
and
twigs
we
judged
that
he
had
come
out
and
got
the
brand
and
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
from
farther
back
in
the
woods
you
know
he
said
i
do
like
this
any
more
than
you
do
i
got
mosquito
bites
on
my
left
arm
he
waited
as
if
for
a
reply
but
getting
none
he
evidently
retreated
the
sound
of
rustling
leaves
and
crackling
twigs
grew
fainter
fainter
still
died
away
altogether
we
turned
then
with
one
accord
and
gazed
through
the
dark
arches
of
the
forest
a
glowing
star
was
retreating
there
a
smouldering
fire
that
seemed
to
move
slowly
and
with
an
appearance
of
dejection
it
was
the
second
time
aggie
and
i
had
seen
fire
thus
carried
through
the
wood
but
whereas
about
the
kettle
there
had
been
a
glow
and
radiance
that
was
almost
triumphant
the
brand
we
now
watched
seemed
smouldering
dejected
ashamed
even
tish
felt
it
the
wretch
she
exclaimed
daring
to
come
here
like
that
no
wonder
he
ashamed
but
aggie
who
is
very
romantic
sat
staring
after
the
distant
torch
wiggins
suffered
so
from
mosquitoes
she
said
softly
iv
the
next
morning
we
found
more
fish
awaiting
us
and
on
the
smooth
sand
of
the
beach
was
a
message
written
with
a
stick
if
you
will
leave
a
wire
hairpin
or
two
on
this
stone
i
can
get
bigger
fish
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
all
those
rabbit
skins
signed
tish
was
touched
by
the
fish
i
think
she
smoothed
off
the
sand
carefully
and
wrote
a
reply
here
are
the
hairpins
thank
you
do
you
want
the
rabbit
skins
all
day
we
were
in
a
state
of
expectancy
the
mosquitoes
were
very
bad
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
excitement
of
the
p
person
i
should
have
given
up
and
gone
home
i
wanted
mashed
potatoes
and
lima
beans
with
butter
dressing
and
a
cup
of
hot
tea
and
muffins
and
ice
in
fact
i
can
not
think
of
anything
i
did
not
want
except
rabbits
and
fish
and
puffballs
and
such
blackberries
as
the
birds
did
not
fancy
although
we
were
well
enough
almost
too
well
the
better
i
felt
the
hungrier
i
got
tish
thought
the
time
had
now
come
to
rest
and
invite
our
souls
she
set
the
example
that
day
by
going
out
on
a
flat
rock
in
the
lake
and
preparing
to
think
all
the
things
she
been
waiting
most
of
her
life
to
consider
i
am
ready
to
form
my
own
opinions
about
some
things
she
said
i
realize
now
that
all
my
life
the
newspapers
and
stupid
people
and
books
have
formed
my
opinions
now
i
going
to
think
along
my
own
lines
is
there
another
life
after
this
do
i
really
desire
the
suffrage
why
am
i
a
baptist
aggie
said
she
would
like
to
invite
her
soul
that
day
also
not
to
form
any
opinions
tish
always
does
that
for
her
but
she
had
to
get
some
clothes
in
september
and
she
might
as
well
think
them
out
so
it
happened
that
i
was
alone
when
i
met
the
p
person
young
woman
i
had
intended
to
wander
only
a
short
way
along
the
trail
but
after
i
had
gone
a
mile
or
two
it
occurred
to
me
as
likely
that
the
driver
would
come
back
that
way
before
long
out
of
curiosity
and
i
thought
i
might
leave
a
message
for
him
to
bring
out
some
fresh
eggs
and
leave
them
there
i
could
tell
tish
i
had
found
a
nest
or
perhaps
since
that
would
be
lying
i
could
put
them
in
a
nest
and
let
her
find
them
i
have
ordered
tea
too
if
i
could
have
thought
of
any
way
to
account
for
it
i
going
to
do
some
meditating
myself
i
remarked
but
i
think
better
when
i
moving
if
i
do
come
back
in
an
hour
or
so
do
imagine
i
been
kidnaped
tish
turned
on
her
stone
and
looked
at
me
you
will
not
be
kidnaped
she
said
shortly
i
can
not
imagine
any
one
safer
than
you
are
in
that
costume
well
i
made
my
way
along
the
trail
as
rapidly
as
i
could
it
was
twenty
miles
there
and
back
and
i
seen
the
day
when
two
city
blocks
would
send
me
home
to
soak
my
feet
in
hot
water
but
the
sandals
were
easy
to
walk
in
and
my
calico
skirt
was
short
and
light
i
had
no
paper
to
write
my
message
on
of
course
but
on
the
way
i
gathered
a
large
white
fungus
and
i
scraped
a
note
on
it
with
a
pin
with
the
fungus
under
my
arm
i
walked
briskly
along
planning
an
omelet
with
the
eggs
if
we
got
any
and
gathering
mushrooms
here
and
there
it
was
the
mushrooms
that
led
me
to
the
discovery
of
a
that
was
prehistoric
in
its
primitiveness
a
clearing
surrounded
by
low
bushes
and
in
the
center
a
fireplace
of
stones
with
a
fire
smouldering
at
one
side
a
heap
of
leaves
and
small
twigs
for
a
bed
a
stump
for
a
seat
and
lying
on
top
of
it
a
sort
of
stone
axe
made
by
inserting
a
sharp
stone
into
the
cleft
of
a
sapling
and
tying
it
into
place
with
a
tendril
pegged
out
on
the
ground
to
cure
was
a
rabbit
skin
indifferently
scraped
it
made
our
aluminum
kettle
and
canvas
tepee
look
like
a
apartment
on
riverside
drive
the
whole
thing
looked
pitiful
hungry
i
thought
of
tish
sitting
on
a
stone
inviting
her
soul
while
rabbits
came
from
miles
round
to
stick
their
heads
through
our
nooses
and
hang
themselves
for
our
dinner
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
should
share
our
plenty
i
thought
it
probable
that
the
gentleman
of
the
woods
lived
here
and
from
the
appearance
of
the
place
he
carried
all
his
possessions
with
him
when
he
wore
his
if
i
had
been
in
any
doubt
the
sight
of
aggie
wire
hairpin
sharpened
and
bent
into
a
serviceable
fishhook
decided
me
i
scratched
a
message
for
him
on
another
fungus
and
left
it
if
you
need
anything
come
to
the
indian
tepee
at
the
lake
we
have
no
clothing
to
spare
but
are
always
glad
to
help
in
time
of
trouble
signed
one
of
the
simple
lifers
i
went
on
after
that
and
about
noon
reached
our
point
of
exodus
from
the
wagon
i
was
tired
and
hot
and
i
kept
thinking
of
my
little
at
home
with
the
electric
fan
going
and
iced
cantaloupe
and
nobody
worrying
about
her
soul
or
thinking
her
own
thoughts
and
no
rabbits
our
suitcases
were
safe
enough
in
the
hollow
tree
and
i
thought
the
spring
wagon
had
been
back
already
for
there
were
fresh
tracks
this
discouraged
me
and
i
sat
down
on
a
log
to
rest
it
was
then
that
i
heard
the
girl
crying
she
was
crying
softly
but
in
the
woods
sounds
travel
i
found
her
on
her
face
on
the
pine
needles
about
twenty
yards
away
wailing
her
heart
out
into
a
pink
automobile
veil
and
she
was
so
absorbed
in
her
misery
that
i
had
to
stoop
and
touch
her
before
she
looked
up
do
cry
i
said
if
you
are
lost
i
can
direct
you
to
a
settlement
she
looked
up
at
me
and
from
being
very
red
and
suffused
she
went
quite
pale
it
seems
that
with
my
bare
legs
and
sandals
and
my
hair
down
which
was
tish
idea
for
making
it
come
in
thick
and
not
gray
and
what
with
my
being
sunburned
and
stained
with
berries
she
thought
i
was
a
wild
woman
i
realized
what
was
wrong
do
be
alarmed
i
said
somewhat
grimly
i
rational
enough
if
i
hop
about
instead
of
walking
it
because
i
the
tomb
of
more
rabbits
than
i
care
to
remember
but
aside
from
that
i
all
right
are
you
lost
she
sat
up
still
staring
and
wiped
her
eyes
no
i
have
a
machine
over
there
among
the
trees
are
there
are
there
plenty
of
rabbits
in
the
woods
thousands
she
was
a
pretty
little
thing
very
young
and
dressed
in
a
white
motor
coat
with
white
shoes
and
hat
and
and
berries
there
are
many
berries
i
admitted
the
birds
eat
we
get
the
ones
they
do
fancy
now
i
did
think
for
a
moment
that
she
was
worried
about
my
diet
but
she
was
worried
about
the
food
supply
in
the
woods
that
was
sure
so
i
sat
down
on
a
stump
and
told
her
about
puffballs
and
what
tish
had
read
about
ants
being
edible
but
acid
and
that
wood
mice
roasted
and
not
cooked
too
dry
were
good
food
but
that
aggie
had
made
us
liberate
the
only
ones
we
had
caught
because
a
man
she
was
once
engaged
to
used
to
carry
a
pet
mouse
in
his
pocket
nothing
had
really
appealed
to
her
until
i
mentioned
wiggins
then
unexpectedly
she
began
to
cry
again
and
after
that
i
got
the
whole
story
it
seems
she
was
in
love
with
a
young
man
who
was
everything
a
young
man
ought
to
be
and
had
money
as
well
but
the
money
was
the
barrier
really
for
the
girl
father
would
believe
that
a
youth
who
played
polo
and
did
not
have
to
work
for
a
living
and
led
cotillons
and
paid
calls
in
the
afternoon
could
have
really
good
red
blood
in
him
he
had
a
man
in
view
for
her
she
said
one
who
had
made
his
money
himself
and
had
to
have
his
valet
lay
out
his
clothes
for
fear
he
make
a
mistake
once
the
valet
had
to
go
to
have
a
tooth
pulled
and
the
man
had
to
decline
a
dinner
father
said
finished
the
little
girl
tearfully
that
if
percy
that
his
name
and
it
counted
against
him
too
that
if
percy
was
a
real
man
he
do
something
and
then
he
on
a
book
of
my
small
brother
telling
how
people
used
to
live
in
the
woods
and
kill
their
own
food
and
make
their
own
fire
the
woodsman
of
course
i
put
in
and
how
the
strong
survived
but
the
weak
succumbed
and
he
said
if
percy
was
a
man
and
not
a
dummy
he
go
out
in
the
woods
primitive
man
without
anything
but
a
pair
of
bathing
trunks
and
keep
himself
alive
for
a
month
if
he
the
test
father
was
willing
to
forget
the
he
said
that
he
knew
willoughby
could
do
it
that
the
other
man
and
that
he
come
in
at
the
end
of
the
time
with
a
deed
for
the
forest
and
mortgages
on
all
the
surrounding
camps
and
percy
agreed
he
did
want
to
he
said
it
took
mentality
and
physical
endurance
as
well
as
some
courage
to
play
polo
father
said
it
did
on
the
part
of
the
pony
then
of
the
men
heard
of
it
and
there
were
bets
on
it
ten
to
one
he
would
do
it
and
twenty
to
one
he
could
do
it
so
percy
decided
to
try
father
was
so
afraid
that
some
of
the
campers
and
guides
would
help
him
that
he
had
notices
sent
out
at
suggestion
offering
a
reward
if
percy
could
be
shown
to
have
asked
any
assistance
oh
i
know
he
sick
in
there
somewhere
or
starving
or
dead
i
had
had
a
great
light
break
over
me
and
now
i
stooped
and
patted
the
girl
on
the
shoulder
dead
certainly
not
i
said
i
saw
him
last
night
saw
him
well
not
exactly
saw
him
there
was
much
light
but
he
alive
and
well
and
do
you
really
want
him
to
win
do
i
she
sat
up
with
shining
eyes
i
do
care
whether
he
owns
anything
in
the
world
but
the
trunks
if
i
did
think
i
add
to
his
troubles
i
go
into
the
woods
this
minute
and
find
him
and
suffer
with
him
you
have
to
be
married
to
him
first
i
objected
rather
startled
but
she
looked
at
me
with
her
cheeks
as
red
strawberries
why
she
demanded
father
crazy
about
primitive
man
did
primitive
man
take
his
woman
to
church
to
be
married
with
eight
brides
maids
and
a
reception
after
the
ceremony
of
course
not
he
grabbed
her
and
carried
her
off
good
heavens
you
not
in
earnest
i
think
i
am
she
said
slowly
i
rather
live
in
the
woods
with
percy
and
no
ceremony
than
live
without
him
anywhere
in
the
world
and
i
bet
primitive
man
would
have
been
wiped
off
the
earth
if
he
had
had
primitive
woman
to
add
her
wits
to
his
strength
if
percy
only
had
a
woman
to
help
him
my
dear
i
said
solemnly
he
has
he
has
not
one
but
three
it
took
me
some
time
to
explain
that
percy
was
not
supporting
a
harem
in
the
maine
woods
but
when
at
last
she
got
my
idea
and
that
the
other
two
classed
with
me
in
beauty
and
attractiveness
she
was
overjoyed
but
percy
promised
not
to
ask
for
help
she
said
suddenly
he
need
my
dear
go
away
and
stop
worrying
about
percy
he
all
right
when
is
the
time
up
in
three
weeks
i
suppose
father
and
the
willoughby
person
will
come
to
meet
him
yes
and
all
the
fellows
from
the
club
who
have
put
money
up
on
him
we
going
to
motor
over
and
father
bringing
the
physical
director
of
the
athletic
club
he
not
only
got
to
survive
but
he
got
to
be
in
good
condition
he
be
in
good
condition
i
said
grimly
does
he
drink
and
smoke
a
little
not
too
much
oh
yes
i
had
forgotten
she
opened
up
a
little
gold
cigarette
case
which
she
took
from
her
pocket
and
extracted
a
handful
of
cigarettes
if
you
are
going
to
see
him
she
said
you
might
put
them
where
find
them
certainly
not
but
that
not
giving
them
to
him
my
dear
child
i
said
sternly
percy
is
going
to
come
out
of
these
woods
so
well
and
strong
that
he
may
not
have
to
work
but
he
want
to
and
he
not
smoke
anything
stronger
than
if
we
to
take
charge
of
this
thing
she
understood
quickly
enough
and
i
must
say
she
was
grateful
she
was
almost
radiant
with
joy
when
i
told
her
how
capable
tish
was
and
that
she
was
sure
to
be
interested
and
about
aggie
hay
fever
and
wiggins
and
the
rabbit
snares
she
leaned
over
and
kissed
me
impulsively
you
dear
old
thing
she
cried
i
know
you
look
after
him
and
make
him
comfortable
and
how
old
is
miss
letitia
something
over
fifty
and
aggie
pilkington
about
the
same
although
she
wo
admit
it
she
kissed
me
again
at
that
and
after
looking
at
her
wrist
watch
she
jumped
to
her
feet
heavens
she
said
it
four
and
my
engine
has
been
running
all
this
time
she
got
a
smart
little
car
from
somewhere
up
the
road
and
the
last
i
saw
of
her
she
was
smiling
back
over
her
shoulder
and
the
car
running
on
the
edge
of
a
ditch
you
are
three
darlings
she
called
back
and
tell
percy
i
love
him
love
him
love
him
i
thought
i
never
get
back
to
the
lake
i
was
tired
to
begin
with
and
after
i
gone
about
four
miles
and
was
limping
with
a
splinter
in
my
heel
and
no
needle
to
get
it
out
with
i
found
i
still
had
the
fungus
message
to
the
person
under
my
arm
it
was
dark
when
i
got
back
and
my
nerves
were
rather
unstrung
what
with
wandering
from
the
path
here
and
there
with
nothing
to
eat
since
morning
and
running
into
a
tree
and
taking
the
skin
off
my
nose
when
i
limped
into
camp
at
last
i
did
care
whether
percy
lived
or
died
and
the
thought
of
rabbit
stew
made
my
mouth
water
it
was
not
rabbit
however
aggie
was
sitting
alone
by
the
fire
waving
a
brand
round
her
head
to
keep
off
mosquitoes
and
in
front
of
her
dangling
from
the
spit
were
a
dozen
pairs
of
frogs
legs
in
a
row
i
ate
six
pairs
without
a
question
and
then
i
asked
for
tish
catching
frogs
said
aggie
laconically
and
flourished
the
brand
where
pulling
them
off
the
trees
where
do
you
think
she
gets
them
she
demanded
a
large
mosquito
broke
through
her
guard
at
that
moment
and
she
flung
the
torch
angrily
at
the
fire
i
eaten
alive
she
snapped
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
smallpox
or
something
they
could
all
take
and
go
away
and
die
the
frogs
legs
were
heavenly
although
in
a
restaurant
i
loathe
the
things
i
left
aggie
wondering
if
her
hay
fever
was
contagious
through
the
blood
and
hoping
the
mosquitoes
would
get
it
and
sneeze
themselves
to
death
and
went
to
find
tish
she
was
standing
in
the
margin
of
the
lake
up
to
her
knees
in
water
with
a
blazing
torch
in
one
hand
and
one
of
our
tent
poles
in
the
other
tied
to
the
end
the
pole
was
a
grapevine
line
and
a
made
of
a
hairpin
was
attached
to
it
her
method
which
it
seems
she
heard
from
charlie
sands
and
which
was
not
in
the
young
woodsman
was
simple
and
effectual
do
move
she
said
tensely
when
she
heard
me
on
the
bank
one
here
as
big
as
a
chicken
she
struck
the
flare
forward
and
i
could
see
the
frog
looking
at
it
and
not
blinking
he
sat
in
a
sort
of
heavenly
ecstasy
like
a
dog
about
to
bay
at
the
moon
while
the
hook
dangled
just
at
his
throat
i
to
do
it
lizzie
it
so
easy
she
said
calmly
still
tickling
the
thing
throat
with
the
hook
grab
him
as
i
throw
him
at
you
they
slip
off
sometimes
the
next
instant
she
jerked
the
hook
up
and
caught
the
creature
by
the
lower
jaw
it
was
the
neatest
thing
i
have
ever
seen
tish
came
wading
over
to
where
i
stood
and
examined
the
frog
if
we
only
had
some
tartare
sauce
she
said
regretfully
i
wish
look
at
my
ankle
lizzie
there
something
stuck
to
it
the
something
was
a
leech
it
refused
to
come
off
and
so
she
carried
both
frog
and
leech
back
to
the
camp
aggie
said
on
no
account
to
pull
a
leech
off
it
left
its
teeth
in
and
the
teeth
went
on
burrowing
or
laid
eggs
or
something
one
must
leave
it
on
until
it
was
full
and
round
and
could
hold
any
more
and
then
it
dropped
off
so
all
night
tish
kept
getting
up
and
going
to
the
fire
to
see
if
it
was
swelling
but
toward
morning
she
fell
asleep
and
it
dropped
off
and
we
had
a
terrible
feeling
that
it
was
somewhere
in
our
blankets
but
the
leech
caused
less
excitement
that
evening
than
my
story
of
percy
and
the
little
girl
in
the
white
coat
aggie
was
entranced
and
tish
had
made
percy
a
suit
of
rabbit
skin
with
a
cap
to
match
and
outlined
a
set
of
exercises
to
increase
his
chest
measure
before
i
was
half
through
with
my
story
but
percy
did
not
appear
although
we
had
an
idea
that
he
was
not
far
off
in
the
woods
we
could
hear
a
crackling
in
the
undergrowth
but
when
we
called
there
was
no
reply
tish
was
eating
a
frog
leg
when
the
idea
came
to
her
he
never
come
out
under
ordinary
circumstances
in
that
er
costume
she
said
suppose
we
call
for
help
he
probably
come
bounding
help
she
yelled
between
bites
as
one
may
say
help
fire
police
help
cried
aggie
percy
help
it
sounded
like
mercy
help
it
worked
like
a
charm
the
faint
cracking
became
louder
nearer
turned
from
a
suspicion
to
a
certainty
and
from
a
certainty
to
a
fact
the
bushes
parted
and
percy
stood
before
us
all
he
saw
was
three
elderly
women
eating
frogs
legs
round
a
fire
under
a
cloud
of
mosquitoes
he
stopped
dumbfounded
and
in
that
instant
we
saw
that
he
did
need
the
physical
exercises
but
that
of
course
he
did
need
the
suit
great
scott
he
panted
i
thought
i
heard
you
calling
for
help
so
we
did
said
tish
but
we
did
need
it
wo
you
sit
down
he
looked
dazed
and
backed
toward
the
bushes
i
i
think
he
said
if
there
nothing
wrong
i
better
not
fiddlesticks
tish
snapped
are
you
ashamed
of
the
body
the
lord
gave
you
do
you
suppose
we
all
got
skins
and
did
i
thrash
my
nephew
charlie
sands
when
he
was
almost
as
big
as
you
and
had
less
on
for
bathing
in
the
river
sit
down
man
and
do
be
a
fool
he
edged
toward
the
fire
looking
rather
silly
and
aggie
passed
him
a
frog
leg
on
a
piece
of
bark
try
this
percy
she
said
smiling
at
the
name
he
looked
ready
to
run
i
guess
you
seen
the
notices
he
said
so
you
understand
i
can
not
accept
any
food
or
assistance
i
very
grateful
to
you
anyhow
you
may
take
what
food
you
find
surely
said
aggie
if
you
find
a
roasted
frog
leg
on
the
ground
so
there
nothing
to
prevent
you
eating
it
is
there
nothing
at
all
said
percy
and
picked
it
up
unless
of
course
it
not
a
trap
young
man
said
tish
eat
it
and
enjoy
it
there
are
lots
more
where
it
came
from
he
relaxed
at
that
and
on
tish
bringing
out
a
blanket
from
the
tent
to
throw
over
his
shoulders
he
became
almost
easy
he
was
much
surprised
to
learn
that
we
knew
his
story
and
when
i
repeated
the
love
him
message
he
seemed
to
grow
a
foot
taller
and
his
eyes
glowed
i
holding
out
all
right
he
said
i
fit
physically
but
the
thing
that
gets
my
goat
is
that
i
to
come
out
clothed
dorothea
father
says
that
primitive
man
with
nothing
but
his
hands
and
perhaps
a
stone
club
fed
himself
made
himself
a
shelter
and
clothed
himself
in
skins
skins
i
so
big
that
two
or
three
bears
would
hardly
be
enough
i
did
find
a
hole
that
i
thought
a
bear
or
two
might
fall
into
and
got
almost
stung
to
death
robbing
a
bee
tree
to
bait
the
thing
with
honey
but
there
are
any
bears
and
if
there
were
how
i
kill
wait
until
they
starve
to
death
rabbits
said
tish
he
looked
down
at
himself
and
he
seemed
very
large
in
the
firelight
dear
lady
he
said
there
are
enough
rabbits
in
the
county
to
cover
me
and
how
i
put
together
i
was
a
fool
to
undertake
the
thing
that
all
but
are
you
in
love
with
her
asked
aggie
well
i
guess
i
am
it
is
that
you
know
i
a
good
bit
worse
than
crazy
about
her
a
man
might
be
crazy
about
a
mint
julep
or
a
power
boat
but
he
hardly
go
into
the
woods
in
his
skin
and
live
on
fish
until
he
scaly
for
either
of
them
if
i
do
get
her
i
do
want
to
live
that
all
he
looked
so
gloomy
and
savage
that
we
saw
he
meant
it
and
aggie
was
perceptibly
thrilled
trish
however
was
thinking
hard
her
eyes
on
the
leech
was
there
anything
in
the
agreement
to
prevent
your
accepting
any
suggestions
he
pondered
no
i
was
to
be
given
no
food
drink
shelter
or
any
weapon
the
old
man
forgot
fire
that
how
i
came
to
beg
some
fire
and
brains
reflected
tish
we
given
you
the
first
and
plenty
of
the
second
to
offer
now
young
man
this
is
my
plan
give
you
nothing
but
suggestions
if
now
and
then
you
find
a
cooked
meal
under
that
tree
that
accident
not
design
and
you
better
eat
it
can
you
sew
i
like
the
irishman
and
the
fiddle
i
never
tried
but
i
guess
i
can
he
was
much
more
cheerful
do
you
have
to
be
alone
i
believe
he
took
that
for
granted
in
this
costume
will
it
take
you
long
to
move
over
here
i
think
i
can
move
without
a
van
he
said
grinning
my
sole
worldly
possessions
are
a
stone
hatchet
and
a
hairpin
fishhook
get
them
and
come
over
commanded
tish
when
you
leave
this
forest
at
the
end
of
the
time
you
are
going
to
be
fed
and
clothed
and
carry
a
tent
you
will
have
with
you
smoked
meat
and
fish
you
will
carry
under
your
arm
an
indian
clock
or
sundial
you
will
have
a
lamp
if
we
can
find
a
clamshell
or
a
broken
bottle
and
you
will
have
a
outfit
with
your
monogram
on
it
but
my
dear
friend
he
said
i
am
not
supposed
to
have
any
assistance
and
assistance
tish
snapped
who
said
assistance
i
providing
the
brains
but
you
do
it
all
yourself
he
moved
over
an
hour
or
so
later
and
tish
and
i
went
into
the
tent
to
bed
somewhat
later
when
she
limped
to
the
fire
to
see
how
the
leech
was
filling
up
he
and
aggie
were
sitting
together
talking
he
of
dorothea
and
aggie
of
wiggins
tish
said
they
were
both
talking
at
the
same
time
neither
one
listening
to
the
other
and
that
it
sounded
like
this
she
so
sweet
and
trusting
and
honest
well
i
believe
what
she
said
if
she
fell
off
a
roof
on
a
rainy
day
and
was
picked
up
by
a
man
with
a
horse
and
buggy
quite
unconscious
v
the
next
three
weeks
were
busy
times
for
percy
he
wore
tish
blanket
for
two
days
and
then
finding
it
in
the
way
he
discarded
it
altogether
seen
in
daylight
it
was
easy
to
understand
why
little
dorothea
was
in
love
with
him
he
was
a
handsome
young
giant
although
much
bitten
by
mosquitoes
and
scratched
with
briers
the
arrangement
was
a
good
one
all
round
he
knew
of
things
in
the
wood
we
never
heard
of
wild
onions
and
artichokes
and
he
had
found
a
clump
of
wild
cherry
trees
he
made
snares
of
the
fibers
of
tree
bark
and
he
brought
in
turtles
and
made
plates
out
of
the
shells
and
all
the
time
he
was
working
on
his
outfit
curing
rabbit
skins
and
sewing
them
together
with
fibers
under
my
direction
when
he
made
one
sleeve
of
his
coat
we
had
a
sort
of
celebration
he
found
an
empty
bottle
somewhere
in
the
woods
and
he
had
made
a
decoction
that
he
declared
was
cherry
brandy
keeping
it
in
the
sun
to
ferment
well
he
insisted
on
opening
the
brandy
that
day
and
passing
it
round
we
had
cups
made
of
leaves
and
we
drank
to
his
sleeve
although
the
stuff
was
villainous
he
had
put
the
sleeve
on
and
it
looked
rather
inadequate
here
fun
he
said
joyously
if
my
english
tailor
could
see
this
sleeve
he
die
of
envy
a
sleeve
not
all
of
a
coat
but
what
a
coat
without
a
sleeve
look
at
it
grace
ease
of
line
and
beauty
of
material
aggie
lifted
her
leaf
to
dorothea
she
said
and
may
the
sleeve
soon
be
about
her
tish
thought
this
toast
was
not
delicate
but
percy
was
enchanted
with
it
it
was
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
of
percy
joining
our
camp
that
the
willoughby
person
appeared
it
happened
at
a
most
inauspicious
time
we
had
eaten
supper
and
were
gathered
round
the
and
tish
had
put
wet
leaves
on
the
blaze
to
make
a
smudge
that
would
drive
the
mosquitoes
away
we
were
sitting
there
tish
and
i
coughing
and
aggie
sneezing
in
the
smoke
when
percy
came
running
through
the
woods
and
stopped
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
near
by
bring
a
club
somebody
he
yelled
i
treed
the
back
of
my
coat
tish
ran
with
one
of
the
tent
poles
a
tepee
is
inconvenient
for
that
reason
every
time
any
one
wants
a
or
a
weapon
the
tent
loses
part
of
its
bony
structure
and
sags
like
the
face
of
a
stout
woman
who
has
reduced
and
it
turned
out
that
percy
had
treed
a
coon
he
climbed
up
after
it
taking
tish
pole
with
him
to
dislodge
it
and
it
was
at
that
moment
that
a
man
rode
into
the
clearing
and
practically
fell
off
his
horse
he
was
dirty
and
scratched
with
brambles
and
his
once
immaculate
were
torn
he
was
about
to
take
off
his
hat
when
he
got
a
good
look
at
us
and
changed
his
mind
have
you
got
anything
to
eat
he
asked
i
been
lost
since
noon
yesterday
and
i
about
all
in
the
leaves
caught
fire
suddenly
and
sent
a
glow
into
percy
tree
i
shall
never
forget
aggie
agonized
look
or
the
way
tish
flung
on
more
wet
leaves
in
a
hurry
i
sorry
she
said
but
supper
over
but
surely
a
starving
man
you
wo
starve
inside
of
a
week
tish
snapped
you
got
enough
flesh
on
you
for
a
month
he
stared
at
her
incredulously
but
my
good
woman
he
said
i
can
pay
for
my
food
even
you
itinerant
folk
need
money
now
and
then
do
you
come
now
cook
me
a
fish
i
pay
for
it
my
name
is
willoughby
willoughby
perhaps
you
heard
of
me
tish
cast
a
swift
glance
into
the
tree
it
was
in
shadow
again
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
she
said
afterward
that
the
whole
plan
came
to
her
in
the
instant
of
that
breath
we
can
give
you
something
she
said
indifferently
we
have
a
stewed
rabbit
if
you
care
for
it
there
was
a
wild
scramble
in
the
tree
at
that
moment
and
we
thought
all
was
over
we
learned
later
that
percy
had
made
a
move
to
climb
higher
out
of
the
firelight
and
the
coon
had
been
so
startled
that
he
almost
fell
out
but
instead
of
looking
up
to
investigate
the
stranger
backed
toward
the
fire
only
a
wildcat
said
tish
they
not
come
near
the
fire
near
exclaimed
willoughby
if
they
came
any
nearer
they
have
to
get
into
it
i
think
said
tish
that
if
you
are
afraid
of
them
although
you
are
safe
enough
if
you
do
get
under
the
trees
they
jump
down
you
know
that
you
would
better
stay
by
the
fire
in
the
morning
we
start
you
toward
a
road
all
night
with
percy
in
the
tree
i
gave
her
a
savage
glance
but
she
ignored
me
the
willoughby
looked
up
nervously
and
of
course
there
were
trees
all
about
i
guess
i
stay
he
agreed
what
about
that
rabbit
i
did
not
know
tish
plan
at
that
time
and
while
aggie
was
feeding
the
willoughby
person
and
he
was
grumbling
over
his
food
i
took
tish
aside
are
you
crazy
i
demanded
just
through
your
idiocy
percy
will
have
to
stay
in
that
tree
all
night
and
he
go
to
sleep
likely
and
fall
out
tish
eyed
me
coldly
you
are
a
good
soul
lizzie
she
observed
but
do
overwork
your
mind
go
back
and
do
something
easy
let
the
willoughby
cross
your
palm
with
silver
and
tell
his
fortune
if
he
asks
any
questions
i
queen
of
the
gypsies
and
give
him
to
understand
that
we
in
temporary
hiding
from
the
law
the
worse
he
thinks
of
us
the
better
remember
we
seen
percy
i
not
going
to
lie
i
said
sternly
pooh
tish
sneered
that
wretch
came
into
the
woods
to
gloat
over
his
rival
misery
the
truth
too
good
for
him
i
did
my
best
and
i
still
have
the
silver
dollar
he
gave
me
i
told
him
i
saw
a
small
girl
who
loved
him
but
did
realize
it
yet
and
there
was
another
man
good
gracious
i
said
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
your
palm
i
see
the
other
man
but
he
seems
to
be
in
trouble
his
clothing
has
been
stolen
for
he
has
none
and
he
is
hungry
very
hungry
ha
said
willoughby
looking
startled
you
old
gypsies
beat
the
devil
hungry
eh
is
that
all
the
light
flared
up
again
and
i
could
see
clearly
the
pale
spot
in
the
tree
which
was
percy
but
willoughby
eyes
were
on
his
palm
he
has
about
decided
to
give
up
something
i
can
not
see
just
what
i
said
loudly
he
seems
to
be
in
the
air
in
a
tree
perhaps
if
he
wishes
to
be
safe
he
should
go
higher
percy
took
the
hint
and
moved
up
and
i
said
that
was
all
there
was
in
the
palm
soon
after
that
willoughby
stretched
out
on
the
ground
by
the
fire
and
before
long
he
was
asleep
during
the
night
i
heard
tish
moving
stealthily
about
in
the
tepee
and
she
stepped
on
my
ankle
as
she
went
out
i
fell
asleep
again
as
soon
as
it
stopped
aching
just
at
dawn
tish
came
back
and
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
where
the
blackberry
cordial
she
whispered
i
sat
up
instantly
has
percy
fallen
out
of
the
tree
no
do
ask
any
questions
lizzie
i
want
it
for
myself
that
dratted
horse
fell
on
me
she
refused
to
say
any
more
and
lay
down
groaning
but
i
was
too
worried
to
sleep
again
in
the
morning
percy
was
gone
from
the
tree
willoughby
had
more
rabbit
and
prepared
to
leave
the
forest
he
offered
tish
a
dollar
for
the
two
meals
and
a
bed
and
tish
who
was
moving
about
stiffly
said
that
she
and
her
people
took
no
money
for
their
hospitality
telling
fortunes
was
one
thing
bread
and
salt
was
another
she
looked
quite
haughty
and
the
willoughby
person
apologized
and
went
into
the
woods
to
get
his
horse
the
horse
was
gone
it
was
rather
disagreeable
for
a
time
he
plainly
thought
we
taken
it
although
tish
showed
him
that
the
end
of
the
strap
had
been
chewed
partly
through
and
then
jerked
free
if
the
creature
smelled
a
wildcat
she
said
nothing
would
hold
it
none
of
my
people
ever
bring
a
horse
into
this
part
of
the
country
humph
said
willoughby
well
i
bet
they
take
a
few
out
he
departed
on
foot
shortly
after
very
disgusted
and
suspicious
we
showed
him
the
trail
and
the
last
we
saw
of
him
he
was
striding
along
looking
up
now
and
then
for
wildcats
when
he
was
well
on
his
way
percy
emerged
from
the
bushes
i
had
thought
that
he
had
helped
tish
to
take
the
willoughby
horse
but
it
seems
he
had
not
and
he
was
much
amazed
when
tish
came
through
the
wood
leading
the
creature
by
the
broken
strap
i
turn
it
loose
she
said
to
percy
and
you
can
capture
it
it
will
make
a
good
effect
for
you
to
emerge
from
the
forest
on
horseback
and
anyhow
what
with
the
rabbit
skin
the
tent
and
the
sundial
and
the
other
things
you
have
a
lot
to
carry
you
can
say
you
found
it
straying
in
the
woods
and
captured
it
percy
looked
at
her
with
admiration
not
unmixed
with
reverence
miss
letitia
he
said
solemnly
if
it
were
not
for
dorothea
i
should
ask
you
to
marry
me
i
like
to
have
you
in
my
family
i
am
very
nearly
to
the
end
of
my
narrative
toward
the
last
percy
was
obliged
to
work
far
into
the
night
for
of
course
we
could
not
assist
him
he
made
a
full
suit
of
rabbit
skins
sewed
with
fibers
and
a
cap
and
shoes
of
coonskin
to
match
the
shoes
were
cut
from
a
pattern
that
tish
traced
in
the
sand
on
the
beach
and
the
cap
had
an
eagle
feather
in
it
he
made
a
knapsack
to
hold
the
fish
he
smoked
and
a
bow
and
arrow
that
looked
well
but
would
not
shoot
when
he
had
the
outfit
completed
he
put
it
on
with
the
stone
hatchet
stuck
into
a
grapevine
belt
and
the
bow
and
arrow
over
his
shoulder
and
he
looked
superb
the
question
is
he
reflected
trying
to
view
himself
in
the
edge
of
the
lake
will
dorothea
like
it
she
very
keen
about
clothes
and
gee
how
she
hates
a
beard
you
could
shave
as
the
indians
do
tish
said
how
with
a
clamshell
he
looked
dubious
but
tish
assured
him
it
was
feasible
so
he
hunted
a
clamshell
a
double
one
tish
requested
and
brought
it
into
camp
i
better
do
it
for
you
said
tish
it
likely
to
be
slow
but
it
is
sure
he
was
eyeing
the
clamshell
and
looking
more
and
more
uneasy
you
not
going
to
scrape
it
off
he
asked
anxiously
you
know
pumice
would
be
better
for
that
but
somehow
i
do
like
the
idea
nothing
of
the
sort
said
tish
the
double
clamshell
merely
forms
a
pair
of
indian
nippers
i
going
to
pull
it
out
but
he
made
quite
a
fuss
about
it
and
said
he
did
care
whether
the
indians
did
it
or
not
he
would
i
think
he
saw
how
disappointed
tish
was
and
was
afraid
she
would
attempt
it
while
he
slept
for
he
threw
the
indian
nippers
into
the
lake
and
then
went
over
and
kissed
her
hand
dear
miss
tish
he
said
no
one
realizes
more
than
i
your
inherent
nobility
of
soul
and
steadfastness
of
purpose
i
admire
them
both
but
if
you
attempt
the
indian
nipper
business
or
to
singe
me
like
a
chicken
while
i
sleep
i
shall
be
forgive
me
but
i
know
my
impulsiveness
of
disposition
i
shall
be
really
vexed
with
you
toward
the
last
we
all
became
uneasy
for
fear
hard
work
was
telling
on
him
physically
he
used
to
sit
on
the
ground
sewing
for
dear
life
and
singing
hood
song
of
the
shirt
in
a
doleful
tenor
you
know
he
said
i
thought
once
or
twice
i
like
to
do
something
have
a
business
like
other
fellows
but
somehow
dressmaking
never
occurred
to
me
do
you
think
the
expression
of
this
right
pant
is
good
and
shall
i
make
this
gore
bias
or
on
the
selvage
he
wanted
to
slash
one
trouser
leg
why
not
he
demanded
when
tish
frowned
him
down
it
awfully
fetching
and
beauty
you
know
do
you
suppose
my
breastbone
will
ever
straighten
out
again
it
concave
from
stooping
it
was
after
this
that
tish
made
him
exercise
morning
and
evening
and
then
take
a
swim
in
the
lake
by
the
time
he
was
to
start
back
he
was
in
wonderful
condition
and
even
the
horse
looked
saucy
and
shiny
owing
to
our
rubbing
him
down
each
day
with
dried
grasses
the
actual
was
rather
sad
we
grown
to
think
a
lot
of
the
boy
and
i
believe
he
liked
us
he
kissed
each
one
of
us
twice
once
for
himself
and
once
for
dorothea
and
flushed
a
little
over
doing
it
and
aggie
eyes
were
full
of
tears
he
rode
away
down
the
trail
like
a
mixture
of
robinson
crusoe
and
indian
brave
his
stick
his
sundial
with
burned
figures
and
his
bow
and
arrow
jingling
his
eagle
feather
blowing
back
in
the
wind
and
his
moccasined
feet
thrust
into
willoughby
stirrups
and
left
us
desolate
tish
watched
him
out
of
sight
with
set
lips
and
aggie
was
whimpering
on
a
bank
tish
she
said
brokenly
does
he
recall
anything
to
you
only
my
age
said
tish
rather
wearily
and
that
i
an
elderly
spinster
teaching
children
to
defy
their
parents
and
committing
larceny
to
help
them
to
me
said
aggie
softly
he
is
young
love
going
out
to
seek
his
mate
oh
tish
do
you
remember
how
wiggins
used
to
ride
by
taking
his
work
horses
to
be
shod
we
went
home
the
following
day
which
was
the
time
the
man
was
to
meet
us
we
started
very
early
and
were
properly
clothed
and
hatted
when
we
saw
him
down
the
road
the
person
came
on
without
hurry
and
surveyed
us
as
he
came
well
ladies
he
said
stopping
before
us
i
see
you
pulled
it
off
all
right
we
had
a
very
nice
time
thank
you
said
tish
drawing
on
her
gloves
it
been
rather
lonely
of
course
the
person
did
not
speak
again
until
he
had
reached
the
open
road
then
he
turned
round
the
horse
business
was
pretty
good
he
said
you
ought
to
hev
seen
them
folks
when
he
rode
out
of
the
wood
flabbergasted
ai
the
word
they
was
tish
whispered
to
us
to
show
moderate
interest
and
to
say
as
little
as
possible
except
to
protest
our
ignorance
and
we
got
the
story
at
last
like
this
it
seems
the
newspapers
had
been
full
of
the
attempt
percy
was
to
make
and
so
on
the
day
before
quite
a
crowd
had
gathered
to
see
him
come
out
of
the
wood
ten
of
these
here
automobiles
said
the
person
and
a
full
of
newspaper
fellows
from
the
city
with
cameras
and
about
half
the
village
back
home
walked
out
or
druv
and
brought
their
lunches
sort
of
a
picnic
i
kep
my
eye
on
the
girl
and
on
a
willoughby
the
story
is
that
willoughby
who
was
the
father
choice
willoughby
was
pale
and
twitching
and
kep
moving
about
all
the
time
but
the
girl
she
just
kep
her
eyes
on
the
trail
and
waited
noon
was
the
time
set
or
as
near
it
as
possible
the
father
talked
to
the
newspaper
men
mostly
do
think
do
it
boys
he
said
as
soft
as
milk
and
he
surprised
me
by
sticking
it
out
as
long
as
he
has
but
mark
my
words
boys
he
said
been
living
on
berries
and
things
he
could
pick
up
off
the
ground
and
if
his
physical
condition
bad
he
loses
all
bets
it
seems
that
just
as
he
said
it
somebody
pulled
out
a
watch
and
announced
noon
and
on
the
instant
percy
was
seen
riding
down
the
trail
and
whistling
at
first
they
did
not
know
it
was
he
as
they
had
expected
him
to
arrive
on
foot
staggering
with
fatigue
probably
he
rode
out
into
the
sunlight
still
whistling
and
threw
an
unconcerned
glance
over
the
crowd
he
looked
at
the
trees
and
located
north
by
the
moss
on
the
trunks
the
said
and
unslinging
his
indian
clock
he
held
it
in
front
of
him
pointing
north
and
south
it
showed
exactly
noon
it
was
then
and
not
until
then
that
percy
addressed
the
astonished
crowd
twelve
gentlemen
he
said
my
watch
is
quite
accurate
nobody
said
anything
being
as
the
remarked
struck
dumb
but
a
moment
afterward
the
started
a
cheer
and
the
machines
took
it
up
even
the
father
let
loose
as
we
learned
and
the
little
girl
sat
back
in
her
motor
car
and
smiled
through
her
tears
but
willoughby
was
furious
it
seems
he
had
recognized
the
horse
that
my
horse
he
snarled
you
stole
it
from
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
percy
retorted
i
found
the
beast
wandering
loose
among
the
trees
and
i
perfectly
willing
to
return
him
to
you
i
brought
him
out
for
a
purpose
to
make
a
garrison
finish
not
entirely
to
prove
that
you
violated
the
contract
by
going
into
the
forest
to
see
if
you
could
find
me
and
gloat
over
my
misery
instead
you
found
by
the
way
willoughby
did
you
see
any
those
three
hags
are
in
this
said
willoughby
furiously
are
you
willing
to
swear
you
made
that
silly
outfit
i
am
but
not
to
you
and
at
that
minute
if
you
believe
me
said
the
the
girl
got
out
of
her
machine
and
walked
right
up
to
the
percy
fellow
i
was
standing
right
by
and
i
heard
what
she
said
it
was
curious
seeing
he
had
no
help
and
had
gone
in
naked
as
you
may
say
and
came
out
clothed
head
to
foot
with
a
horse
and
weapons
and
a
watch
and
able
to
make
fire
in
seconds
and
a
tent
made
of
about
a
thousand
rabbit
skins
tish
eyed
him
coldly
what
did
she
say
she
demanded
severely
she
said
three
dear
old
things
replied
the
and
she
said
hope
you
kissed
them
for
me
he
did
indeed
said
aggie
dreamily
and
only
roused
when
tish
nudged
her
in
a
rage
charlie
sands
came
to
have
tea
with
us
yesterday
at
tish
he
is
just
back
from
england
and
full
of
the
subject
but
after
all
he
said
the
simple
lifers
take
the
palm
think
of
it
my
three
revered
and
dearly
beloved
spinster
friends
think
of
the
peace
the
holy
calm
of
it
now
if
you
three
would
only
drink
less
tea
and
once
in
a
while
would
get
back
to
nature
a
bit
it
would
be
good
for
you
you
all
too
civilized
probably
said
tish
pulling
down
her
sleeves
to
hide
her
sunburned
hands
but
do
you
think
people
have
so
much
time
in
the
er
woods
time
he
repeated
why
what
is
there
to
do
just
then
the
doorbell
rang
and
a
huge
box
was
carried
in
tish
had
a
warning
and
did
not
wish
to
open
it
but
charlie
sands
insisted
and
cut
the
string
inside
were
three
sets
of
sable
furs
handsomer
than
any
in
the
church
tish
says
and
i
know
i
never
seen
any
like
them
tish
and
i
hid
the
cards
but
aggie
dropped
hers
and
charlie
sands
pounced
on
it
sleeve
is
now
about
dorothea
he
read
aloud
and
then
turning
eyed
us
all
sternly
now
then
said
charlie
sands
out
with
it
what
have
you
been
up
to
this
time
tish
returned
his
gaze
calmly
we
have
been
in
the
maine
woods
in
the
holy
calm
she
said
as
for
those
furs
i
suppose
a
body
may
buy
a
set
of
furs
if
she
likes
this
of
course
was
not
a
lie
as
for
that
card
it
a
mistake
which
it
was
indeed
but
dorothea
persisted
charlie
sands
never
in
my
life
knew
anybody
named
dorothea
did
you
aggie
never
said
aggie
firmly
charlie
sands
apologized
and
looked
thoughtful
on
tish
remaining
rather
injured
he
asked
us
all
out
to
dinner
that
night
and
almost
the
first
thing
he
ordered
was
frogs
legs
aggie
got
rather
white
about
the
lips
i
i
think
i
not
take
any
she
said
feebly
i
i
keep
thinking
of
tish
tickling
their
throats
with
the
hairpin
and
how
percy
we
glared
at
her
but
it
was
too
late
charlie
sands
drew
up
his
chair
and
rested
his
elbows
on
the
table
so
there
was
a
percy
as
well
as
a
dorothea
he
said
cheerfully
i
might
have
known
it
now
we
have
the
story
tish
spy
the
adventure
of
the
detective
the
lady
chauffeur
and
the
man
who
could
not
tell
the
truth
i
it
is
easy
enough
of
course
to
look
back
on
our
canadian
experience
and
see
where
we
went
wrong
what
i
particularly
resent
is
the
attitude
of
charlie
sands
i
am
writing
this
for
his
benefit
it
seems
to
me
that
a
clean
statement
of
the
case
is
due
to
tish
and
in
less
degree
to
aggie
and
myself
it
goes
back
long
before
the
mysterious
cipher
even
the
incident
of
our
abducting
the
girl
in
the
pink
was
after
all
the
inevitable
result
of
the
series
of
occurrences
that
preceded
it
it
is
my
intention
to
give
this
series
of
occurrences
in
their
proper
order
and
without
bias
herbert
spencer
says
that
every
act
of
life
is
the
unavoidable
result
of
every
act
that
has
preceded
it
naturally
therefore
i
begin
with
the
engagement
by
tish
of
a
girl
as
chauffeur
but
even
before
that
there
were
contributing
causes
there
was
the
faulty
rearing
of
the
mcdonald
youth
for
instance
and
æsthetic
dancing
and
afterward
there
was
aggie
hay
fever
which
made
her
sneeze
and
let
go
of
a
rope
at
a
critical
moment
indeed
hay
fever
may
be
said
to
be
one
of
the
fundamental
causes
being
the
reason
we
went
to
canada
it
was
like
this
along
in
june
of
the
year
before
last
aggie
suddenly
announced
that
she
was
going
to
spend
the
summer
in
canada
it
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
hay
fever
she
said
avoiding
tish
eye
ostermaier
says
she
never
sneezed
once
last
year
the
northern
lights
fill
the
air
with
ozone
or
something
like
that
fill
the
air
with
ozone
tish
scoffed
fill
ostermaier
skull
with
ozone
instead
of
brains
more
likely
tish
is
a
good
woman
a
sweet
woman
indeed
but
she
has
a
vein
of
gentle
irony
which
she
inherited
from
her
maternal
grandfather
who
was
on
the
supreme
bench
of
his
country
however
that
spring
she
was
inclined
to
be
irritable
she
could
not
drive
her
car
and
that
was
where
the
trouble
really
started
tish
had
taken
up
æsthetic
dancing
in
mareb
wearing
no
stays
and
a
middy
blouse
and
short
skirt
and
during
a
fairy
dance
where
she
was
to
twirl
on
her
right
toes
keeping
the
three
other
limbs
horizontal
she
twisted
her
right
lower
limb
severely
though
not
incapacitated
she
could
not
use
it
properly
and
failing
one
day
to
put
on
the
brake
quickly
she
drove
into
an
shop
this
was
the
time
one
of
the
newspapers
headed
the
article
even
the
eggs
scrambled
when
tish
decided
to
have
a
chauffeur
for
a
time
she
advertised
there
were
plenty
of
replies
but
all
of
the
applicants
smoked
cigarettes
a
habit
tish
very
properly
deplores
the
idea
of
securing
a
young
woman
was
i
must
confess
mine
plenty
of
young
women
drive
cars
i
said
and
drive
well
and
at
least
they
do
light
a
cigarette
every
time
one
stops
to
let
a
train
go
by
huh
tish
commented
and
have
a
raft
of
men
about
all
the
time
nevertheless
she
acted
on
the
suggestion
advertising
for
a
young
woman
who
could
drive
a
car
and
had
no
followers
hutchins
answered
she
was
very
pretty
and
not
over
twenty
but
asked
about
men
her
face
underwent
a
change
almost
a
hardening
you
not
be
bothered
with
men
she
said
briefly
i
detest
them
and
this
seemed
to
be
the
truth
charlie
sands
for
instance
for
whose
benefit
this
is
being
written
absolutely
failed
to
make
any
impression
on
her
she
met
his
overtures
with
cold
disdain
she
was
also
adamant
to
the
men
at
the
garage
succeeding
in
having
the
gasoline
filtered
through
a
chamois
skin
to
take
out
the
water
where
tish
had
for
years
begged
for
the
same
thing
without
success
though
a
dashing
driver
hutchins
was
careful
she
sat
on
the
small
of
her
back
and
hurled
us
past
the
traffic
policemen
with
a
smile
her
name
was
really
hutchinson
but
it
took
so
long
to
say
it
at
the
rate
she
ran
the
car
that
tish
changed
it
to
hutchins
really
the
whole
experiment
seemed
to
be
an
undoubted
success
when
aggie
got
the
notion
of
canada
into
her
head
now
as
it
happened
owing
to
tish
disapproval
aggie
gave
up
the
canada
idea
in
favor
of
nantucket
some
time
in
june
but
she
had
not
reckoned
with
subconscious
self
tish
was
interested
that
spring
in
the
subconscious
self
you
may
remember
that
only
a
year
or
so
before
it
had
been
the
fourth
dimension
she
became
convinced
that
if
one
were
sufficiently
earnest
one
could
go
through
closed
doors
and
see
into
solids
in
the
former
ambition
she
was
unsuccessful
obtaining
only
bruises
and
disappointment
but
she
did
develop
the
latter
to
a
certain
extent
for
she
met
the
laundress
going
out
one
day
and
without
a
conscious
effort
she
knew
that
she
had
the
best
table
napkins
pinned
to
her
petticoat
she
accused
the
woman
sternly
and
she
had
six
nantucket
said
tish
why
nantucket
i
have
a
niece
there
and
you
said
you
hated
canada
on
the
contrary
tish
replied
with
her
eyes
partly
shut
i
find
that
my
subconscious
self
has
adopted
and
been
working
on
the
canadian
suggestion
what
a
wonderful
thing
is
this
buried
and
greater
ego
worms
rifles
complete
angler
mosquito
netting
canned
goods
and
all
in
my
mind
and
in
orderly
array
worms
i
said
with
i
confess
a
touch
of
scorn
in
my
voice
if
you
will
tell
me
tish
carberry
life
preservers
chanted
tish
subconscious
self
rubber
blankets
small
tent
folding
a
a
a
and
some
beads
and
gewgaws
for
placating
the
indians
then
she
opened
her
eyes
and
took
up
her
knitting
there
are
no
worms
in
canada
lizzie
just
as
there
are
no
snakes
in
ireland
they
were
all
destroyed
during
the
glacial
period
there
are
plenty
of
worms
in
the
united
states
i
said
with
spirit
i
dare
say
they
could
crawl
over
the
border
unless
of
course
they
object
to
being
british
subjects
she
ignored
me
however
and
getting
up
went
to
one
of
her
bureau
drawers
we
saw
then
that
her
subconscious
self
had
written
down
lists
of
various
things
for
the
canadian
excursion
there
was
one
headed
foodstuffs
others
were
necessary
clothing
camp
outfit
weapons
of
defense
and
diversions
under
this
last
heading
it
had
placed
binoculars
yarn
and
needles
life
preservers
a
and
a
boats
she
said
we
can
secure
from
the
indians
who
make
them
i
believe
of
hollow
logs
and
i
shall
rent
a
motor
boat
hutchins
says
she
can
manage
one
when
she
not
doing
that
she
can
wash
dishes
we
had
been
rather
chary
of
motor
boats
you
may
remember
since
the
time
on
lake
penzance
when
something
jammed
on
our
engine
and
we
had
gone
madly
round
the
lake
a
number
of
times
with
people
on
various
docks
trying
to
lasso
us
with
ropes
considering
that
it
was
she
who
had
started
the
whole
thing
and
got
tish
subconscious
mind
to
working
aggie
was
rather
pettish
huh
she
said
i
ca
swim
and
you
know
it
tish
those
canoe
things
turn
over
if
you
so
much
as
sneeze
in
them
you
not
sneeze
said
tish
the
northern
lights
fill
the
air
with
ozone
aggie
looked
at
me
helplessly
but
i
could
do
nothing
only
the
year
before
tish
as
you
may
recall
had
taken
us
out
into
the
maine
woods
without
any
outfit
at
all
and
we
had
lived
on
snared
rabbits
and
things
that
no
christian
woman
ought
to
put
into
her
stomach
this
time
we
were
at
least
to
go
provisioned
and
equipped
where
are
we
going
aggie
asked
far
from
a
white
man
said
tish
away
from
milk
wagons
and
children
on
velocipedes
and
the
grocer
calling
up
every
morning
for
an
order
we
go
to
the
far
north
aggie
where
the
red
man
still
treads
his
native
forests
we
make
our
camp
by
some
lake
where
the
deer
come
at
early
morning
to
drink
and
fish
leap
to
see
the
sunset
well
it
sounded
rather
refreshing
though
i
confess
that
until
tish
mentioned
it
i
had
always
thought
that
fish
leaped
in
the
evening
to
catch
mosquitoes
we
sent
for
hutchins
at
once
she
was
always
respectful
but
never
subservient
she
stood
in
the
doorway
while
tish
explained
how
far
north
she
said
crisply
tish
told
her
we
have
no
destination
she
said
there
a
little
steamer
goes
up
the
river
i
have
in
mind
we
get
off
when
we
see
a
likely
place
are
you
going
for
trout
or
bass
tish
was
rather
uncertain
but
she
said
bass
on
a
chance
and
hutchins
nodded
her
approval
if
it
bass
i
go
she
said
i
not
fond
of
we
shall
have
a
motor
boat
of
course
i
shall
not
take
the
car
hutchins
agreed
indifferently
do
you
worry
about
the
motor
boat
she
said
sometimes
they
go
and
sometimes
they
do
and
i
help
round
the
camp
but
i
not
wash
dishes
why
not
tish
demanded
the
reason
does
really
matter
does
it
what
really
concerns
you
is
the
fact
tish
stared
at
her
but
instead
of
quailing
before
tish
majestic
eye
she
laughed
a
little
i
camped
before
she
said
i
very
useful
about
a
camp
i
like
to
cook
but
i
wo
wash
dishes
i
like
if
you
do
mind
to
see
the
grocery
order
before
it
goes
well
aggie
likes
to
wash
dishes
if
there
is
plenty
of
hot
water
and
hannah
tish
maid
refusing
to
go
with
us
on
account
of
indians
it
seemed
wisest
to
accept
hutchins
services
hannah
defection
was
most
unexpected
as
soon
as
we
reached
our
decision
tish
ordered
beads
for
the
indians
and
in
the
evenings
we
strung
necklaces
and
so
on
while
one
of
us
read
aloud
from
the
works
of
cooper
on
the
second
evening
thus
occupied
hannah
who
is
allowed
to
come
into
tish
in
the
evening
and
knit
suddenly
burst
into
tears
and
refused
to
go
my
scalp
as
good
to
me
as
it
is
to
anybody
miss
tish
she
said
hysterically
and
nothing
would
move
her
she
said
she
would
run
no
risk
of
being
cooked
over
her
own
and
from
that
time
on
she
would
gaze
at
tish
for
long
periods
mournfully
as
though
she
wanted
to
remember
how
she
looked
when
she
was
gone
forever
except
for
hannah
everything
moved
smoothly
tish
told
charlie
sands
about
the
plan
and
he
was
quite
enthusiastic
great
scheme
he
said
eat
a
broiled
black
bass
for
me
and
take
the
advice
of
one
who
knows
do
skimp
on
your
get
the
best
go
light
on
the
canned
goods
if
necessary
but
get
the
best
reels
and
lines
on
the
market
nothing
in
life
hurts
so
much
he
said
impressively
as
to
get
a
bass
to
the
top
of
the
water
and
have
your
line
break
i
had
a
big
fellow
get
away
like
that
and
chase
me
a
mile
with
its
thumb
on
its
nose
this
last
of
course
was
purely
figurative
he
went
away
whistling
i
wish
he
had
been
less
optimistic
when
we
came
back
and
told
him
the
whole
story
and
he
sat
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
hair
as
he
said
crackling
at
the
roots
i
reminded
him
with
some
bitterness
that
he
had
encouraged
us
his
only
retort
was
to
say
that
the
excursion
itself
had
been
harmless
enough
but
that
if
three
elderly
ladies
church
members
in
good
standing
chose
to
become
freebooters
and
pirates
the
moment
they
got
away
from
a
corner
policeman
they
need
not
blame
him
the
last
thing
he
said
that
day
in
june
was
about
take
with
you
he
said
they
charge
a
cent
apiece
for
them
up
there
assorted
colors
and
there
something
stolid
and
british
about
a
canadian
worm
the
fish
are
crazy
about
on
the
other
hand
our
worms
here
are
er
vivacious
animated
i
seen
a
really
brisk
and
united
states
worm
reach
out
and
clutch
a
bass
by
the
gills
i
believe
it
was
the
next
day
that
tish
went
to
the
library
and
read
about
worms
aggie
and
i
had
spent
the
day
buying
tackle
according
to
charlie
sands
advice
we
got
some
very
good
rods
with
reels
for
two
dollars
and
a
quarter
a
dozen
assorted
hooks
for
each
person
and
a
dozen
sinkers
the
man
wanted
to
sell
us
what
he
called
a
landing
net
but
i
took
a
good
look
at
it
and
pinched
aggie
i
can
make
one
out
of
a
barrel
hoop
and
mosquito
netting
i
whispered
so
we
did
not
buy
it
perhaps
he
thought
we
were
novices
for
he
insisted
on
showing
us
all
sorts
of
absurd
things
he
called
them
gaff
hooks
for
landing
big
fish
and
a
spoon
that
was
certainly
no
spoon
and
did
not
fool
us
for
a
minute
being
only
a
few
hooks
and
a
red
feather
he
asked
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
for
it
i
made
one
that
night
at
home
using
a
bit
of
red
feather
from
a
duster
it
cost
me
just
three
cents
of
that
as
of
hutchins
more
later
aggie
whose
idea
of
canada
had
been
the
hotel
frontenac
had
grown
rather
depressed
as
our
preparations
proceeded
she
insisted
that
night
on
recalling
the
fact
that
wiggins
had
been
almost
drowned
in
canada
he
went
with
the
roof
and
gutter
club
lizzie
she
said
and
he
was
a
beautiful
swimmer
but
the
water
comes
from
the
north
pole
freezing
cold
and
the
first
thing
he
knew
the
telephone
bell
rang
just
then
it
was
tish
i
just
come
from
the
library
lizzie
she
said
we
better
raise
the
worms
we
got
a
month
to
do
it
in
hutchins
and
i
will
be
round
with
the
car
at
eight
night
is
the
time
to
get
them
she
refused
to
go
into
details
but
asked
us
to
have
an
electric
flash
or
two
ready
and
a
couple
of
wooden
pails
also
she
said
to
wear
mackintoshes
and
rubbers
just
before
she
rang
off
she
asked
me
to
see
that
there
was
a
package
of
oatmeal
on
hand
but
did
not
explain
when
i
told
aggie
she
eyed
me
miserably
i
wish
she
be
either
more
explicit
or
less
she
said
we
be
arrested
again
i
know
it
now
and
then
tish
enthusiasms
have
brought
us
into
collision
with
the
law
not
that
tish
has
not
every
respect
for
law
and
order
but
that
she
is
apt
to
be
hasty
and
at
times
almost
unconventional
you
remember
said
aggie
that
time
she
tried
to
shoot
the
sheriff
thinking
he
was
a
train
robber
she
started
just
like
this
reading
up
about
and
all
that
i
i
nervous
lizzie
i
was
staying
with
aggie
for
a
few
days
while
my
apartment
was
being
papered
to
soothe
aggie
nerves
i
read
aloud
from
gibbon
rome
until
and
she
grew
gradually
calmer
after
all
lizzie
she
said
she
ca
get
us
into
mischief
with
two
wooden
pails
and
a
package
of
oatmeal
tish
and
hutchins
came
promptly
at
eight
and
we
got
into
the
car
tish
wore
the
intent
and
dreamy
look
that
always
preceded
her
enterprises
there
was
a
tin
quite
new
in
the
tonneau
and
we
placed
our
wooden
pails
beside
it
and
the
oatmeal
in
it
i
confess
i
was
curious
but
to
my
inquiries
tish
made
only
one
reply
worms
now
i
do
not
like
worms
i
do
not
like
to
touch
them
i
do
not
even
like
to
look
at
them
as
the
machine
went
along
i
began
to
have
a
creepy
loathing
of
them
aggie
must
have
been
feeling
the
same
way
for
when
my
hand
touched
hers
she
squealed
over
her
shoulder
tish
told
her
plan
she
said
it
was
easy
to
get
at
night
and
that
hutchins
knew
of
a
place
a
few
miles
out
of
town
where
the
family
was
away
and
where
there
would
be
plenty
we
put
them
in
boxes
of
earth
she
said
and
feed
them
coffee
or
tea
grounds
one
day
and
oatmeal
water
the
next
they
propagate
rapidly
we
have
a
million
to
take
with
us
if
we
only
have
a
hundred
thousand
at
a
cent
apiece
that
a
clear
saving
of
a
thousand
dollars
we
could
sell
some
i
suggested
sarcastically
for
tish
enthusiasms
have
a
way
of
going
wrong
but
she
took
me
seriously
if
there
are
any
fishing
clubs
about
she
said
i
dare
say
they
buy
them
and
we
can
turn
the
money
over
to
ostermaier
for
the
new
organ
tish
had
bought
the
organ
and
had
an
evening
concert
with
it
before
we
turned
off
the
main
road
into
a
private
drive
this
is
the
place
hutchins
said
laconically
tish
got
out
and
took
a
survey
there
was
shrubbery
all
round
and
a
very
large
house
quite
dark
in
the
foreground
drive
onto
the
lawn
hutchins
she
said
when
the
worms
come
up
the
lamps
will
dazzle
them
and
they
be
easy
to
capture
we
bumped
over
a
gutter
and
came
to
a
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
it
would
be
better
if
it
was
raining
tish
said
you
know
yourself
lizzie
how
they
come
up
during
a
gentle
rain
give
me
the
i
do
not
wish
to
lay
undue
blame
on
hutchins
who
was
young
but
it
was
she
who
suggested
that
there
would
probably
be
a
garden
hose
somewhere
and
that
it
would
save
time
i
know
she
went
with
tish
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
that
they
returned
in
ten
minutes
or
so
dragging
a
hose
i
broke
a
window
tish
observed
but
i
left
fifty
cents
on
the
sill
to
replace
it
it
attached
at
the
other
end
run
back
hutchins
and
turn
on
the
water
but
not
too
much
we
need
drown
the
little
creatures
well
i
have
never
seen
anything
work
better
aggie
who
had
refused
to
put
a
foot
out
of
the
car
stood
up
in
it
and
held
the
hose
as
fast
as
she
wet
a
bit
of
lawn
we
followed
with
the
pails
i
spread
my
mackintosh
out
and
knelt
on
it
illustration
as
fast
as
she
wet
a
bit
of
lawn
we
followed
with
the
pails
the
thing
took
skill
the
worms
had
a
way
of
snapping
back
into
their
holes
like
lightning
tish
got
about
three
to
my
one
and
talked
about
packing
them
in
moss
and
ice
and
feeding
them
every
other
day
hutchins
however
stood
on
the
lawn
with
her
hands
in
her
pockets
and
watched
the
house
suddenly
without
warning
aggie
turned
the
hose
directly
on
my
left
ear
and
held
it
there
there
somebody
coming
she
cried
merciful
heavens
what
i
do
with
the
hose
you
can
turn
it
away
from
me
i
snapped
so
she
did
and
at
that
instant
a
young
man
emerged
from
the
shrubbery
he
did
not
speak
at
once
probably
he
could
not
i
happened
to
look
at
hutchins
and
for
all
her
usual
as
charlie
sands
called
it
she
was
clearly
uncomfortable
tish
engaged
in
a
struggle
at
that
moment
and
sitting
back
like
a
robin
did
not
see
him
at
once
well
said
the
young
man
and
again
well
upon
my
word
he
seemed
out
of
breath
with
surprise
and
he
took
off
his
hat
and
mopped
his
head
with
a
handkerchief
and
of
course
as
though
things
were
not
already
bad
enough
aggie
sneezed
at
that
instant
as
she
always
does
when
she
is
excited
and
for
just
a
second
the
hose
was
on
him
it
was
unexpected
and
he
almost
staggered
he
looked
at
all
of
us
including
hutchins
and
ran
his
handkerchief
round
inside
his
collar
then
he
found
his
voice
really
he
said
this
is
awfully
good
of
you
we
do
need
rain
we
tish
was
on
her
feet
by
that
time
but
she
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
i
sorry
if
i
startled
you
said
the
young
man
i
i
a
bit
startled
myself
there
is
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about
said
hutchins
crisply
we
are
getting
worms
to
go
fishing
i
see
said
the
young
man
quite
natural
i
sure
and
where
are
you
going
fishing
hutchins
surprised
us
all
by
rudely
turning
her
back
on
him
considering
we
were
on
his
property
and
had
turned
his
own
hose
on
him
a
little
tact
would
have
been
better
tish
had
found
her
voice
by
that
time
we
broke
a
window
in
the
she
said
but
i
put
fifty
cents
on
the
sill
thank
you
said
the
young
man
hutchins
wheeled
at
that
and
stared
at
him
in
the
most
disagreeable
fashion
but
he
ignored
her
we
are
trespassing
said
tish
but
i
hope
you
understand
we
thought
the
family
was
away
i
just
happened
to
be
passing
through
he
explained
i
awfully
attached
to
the
place
for
various
reasons
whenever
i
in
town
i
spend
my
evenings
wandering
through
the
shrubbery
and
remembering
er
happier
days
i
think
the
lamps
are
going
out
said
hutchins
sharply
if
we
to
get
back
to
town
ah
he
broke
in
so
you
have
come
out
from
the
city
surely
said
hutchins
to
tish
it
is
unnecessary
to
give
this
gentleman
any
information
about
ourselves
we
have
done
no
damage
except
the
window
he
said
we
paid
for
that
she
said
in
a
nasty
tone
and
to
tish
how
do
we
know
this
place
is
his
he
probably
some
newspaper
man
and
if
you
tell
him
who
you
are
this
whole
thing
will
be
in
the
morning
paper
like
the
eggs
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
he
said
that
i
am
nothing
of
the
sort
in
fact
if
you
will
give
me
a
little
time
i
i
like
to
tell
all
about
myself
i
got
a
lot
to
say
that
highly
interesting
if
only
listen
hutchins
however
only
gave
him
a
cold
glance
of
suspicion
and
put
the
pails
in
the
car
then
she
got
in
and
sat
down
i
take
it
he
said
to
her
that
you
decline
either
to
give
or
to
receive
any
information
absolutely
he
sighed
then
aggie
declares
of
course
he
said
though
i
have
really
the
slightest
curiosity
i
could
easily
find
out
you
know
your
license
plates
are
under
the
cushion
i
sitting
on
said
hutchins
and
started
the
engine
really
hutchins
said
tish
i
do
see
any
reason
for
being
so
suspicious
i
have
always
believed
in
human
nature
and
seldom
have
i
been
disappointed
the
young
man
has
done
nothing
to
justify
rudeness
and
since
we
are
trespassing
on
his
place
huh
was
all
hutchins
said
the
young
man
sauntered
over
to
the
car
with
his
hands
thrust
into
this
coat
pockets
he
was
especially
then
when
he
was
smiling
hutchins
he
said
well
that
a
clue
anyhow
it
it
an
uncommon
name
you
did
happen
to
notice
a
large
sign
by
the
gate
did
you
hutchins
only
looked
ahead
and
ignored
him
as
tish
said
afterward
we
had
a
good
many
worms
anyhow
and
as
the
young
man
and
hutchins
had
clearly
taken
an
awful
dislike
to
each
other
at
first
sight
the
best
way
to
avoid
trouble
was
to
go
home
so
she
got
into
the
car
the
young
man
helped
her
and
took
off
his
hat
come
out
any
time
you
like
he
said
affably
i
not
here
at
all
in
the
daytime
and
the
grounds
are
really
rather
nice
come
out
and
get
some
roses
we
some
pretty
good
ones
english
importations
if
you
care
to
bring
some
children
from
the
tenements
out
for
a
picnic
please
feel
free
to
do
it
we
not
selfish
hutchins
rudely
started
the
car
before
he
had
finished
but
he
ignored
her
and
waved
a
cordial
farewell
to
the
rest
of
us
bring
as
many
as
you
like
he
called
sunday
is
a
good
day
ask
miss
miss
hutchins
to
come
out
and
bring
some
friends
along
we
drove
back
at
the
most
furious
rate
tish
was
at
last
compelled
to
remonstrate
with
hutchins
not
only
are
we
going
too
fast
she
said
but
you
were
really
rude
to
that
nice
young
man
i
wish
i
had
turned
the
hose
on
him
and
drowned
him
said
hutchins
between
her
teeth
ii
hutchins
brought
a
newspaper
to
tish
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
and
tish
afterwards
said
her
expression
was
positively
malevolent
in
such
a
young
and
pretty
woman
the
newspaper
said
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
rob
the
newcomb
place
the
night
before
but
that
the
thieves
had
apparently
secured
nothing
but
a
package
of
oatmeal
and
a
tin
which
they
had
abandoned
on
the
lawn
some
color
however
was
lent
to
the
fear
that
they
had
secured
an
amount
of
money
from
the
fact
that
a
silver
had
been
found
on
the
window
sill
of
a
the
newcomb
family
was
at
its
summer
home
on
the
maine
coast
you
see
hutchins
said
to
tish
that
man
did
belong
there
at
all
he
was
just
impertinent
and
laughing
in
his
sleeve
tish
was
really
awfully
put
out
having
planned
to
take
the
sunday
school
there
for
a
picnic
she
was
much
pleased
however
at
astuteness
i
shall
take
her
along
to
canada
she
said
to
me
the
girl
has
instinct
which
is
better
than
reason
her
subconsciousness
is
unusually
active
looking
back
as
i
must
and
knowing
now
all
that
was
in
her
small
head
while
she
whistled
about
the
car
or
all
that
was
behind
her
smile
one
wonders
if
women
really
should
have
the
vote
so
many
of
them
are
creatures
of
sex
and
guile
a
word
from
her
would
have
cleared
up
so
much
and
she
never
spoke
it
well
we
spent
most
of
july
in
getting
ready
to
go
charlie
sands
said
the
mosquitoes
and
black
flies
would
be
gone
by
august
and
we
were
in
no
hurry
we
bought
a
good
tent
with
a
diagram
of
how
to
put
it
up
some
folding
and
a
stove
the
day
we
bought
the
tent
we
had
rather
a
shock
for
as
we
left
the
shop
the
suburban
youth
passed
us
we
ignored
him
completely
but
he
lifted
his
hat
hutchins
who
was
waiting
in
tish
car
saw
him
too
and
went
quite
white
with
fury
shortly
after
that
hannah
came
in
one
night
and
said
that
a
man
was
watching
tish
windows
we
thought
it
was
imagination
and
tish
gave
her
a
dose
of
sulphur
and
molasses
her
liver
being
sluggish
probably
an
indian
i
dare
say
was
tish
caustic
comment
in
view
of
later
developments
however
it
is
a
pity
we
did
not
investigate
hannah
story
for
aggie
going
home
from
tish
late
one
night
in
tish
car
had
a
similar
experience
declaring
that
a
small
machine
had
followed
them
driven
by
a
man
with
a
mustache
she
said
too
that
hutchins
swerving
sharply
had
struck
the
smaller
machine
a
glancing
blow
and
almost
upset
it
it
was
about
the
middle
of
july
i
believe
that
tish
received
the
following
letter
learning
that
you
have
decided
to
take
a
in
canada
i
venture
to
offer
my
services
as
guide
philosopher
and
friend
i
know
canada
thoroughly
can
locate
bass
as
nearly
as
it
lies
in
a
mortal
so
to
do
can
manage
a
motor
launch
am
thoroughly
at
home
in
a
canoe
can
shoot
swim
and
cook
the
last
indifferently
well
know
the
indian
mind
and
my
own
and
will
carry
water
and
chop
wood
i
do
not
drink
and
such
smoking
as
i
do
will
if
i
am
engaged
be
done
in
the
solitude
of
the
woods
i
am
young
and
of
a
cheerful
disposition
my
object
is
not
money
but
only
expenses
paid
and
a
chance
to
forget
a
recent
and
still
poignant
grief
i
hope
you
will
see
the
necessity
for
such
an
addition
to
your
party
and
allow
me
to
subscribe
myself
madam
your
most
obedient
servant
updike
tish
was
much
impressed
but
hutchins
in
whose
judgment
she
began
to
have
the
greatest
confidence
opposed
the
idea
i
would
think
of
it
she
said
briefly
why
it
a
frank
straightforward
letter
he
likes
himself
too
much
and
you
should
always
be
suspicious
of
anything
that
offered
too
cheap
so
the
updike
application
was
refused
i
have
often
wondered
since
what
would
have
been
the
result
had
we
accepted
it
the
worms
were
doing
well
though
tish
found
that
hannah
neglected
them
and
was
compelled
to
feed
them
herself
on
the
day
before
we
started
we
packed
them
carefully
in
ice
and
moss
and
fed
them
that
was
the
day
the
european
war
was
declared
canada
is
at
war
tish
telephoned
the
papers
say
the
whole
country
is
full
of
spies
blowing
up
bridges
and
railroads
we
can
still
go
to
the
seashore
i
said
the
bead
things
will
do
for
the
missionary
box
to
africa
seashore
nothing
tish
retorted
we
going
of
course
just
as
we
planned
we
keep
our
eyes
open
that
all
i
not
for
one
side
or
the
other
but
a
spy
a
spy
later
that
evening
she
called
again
to
say
there
were
rumors
that
the
canadian
forests
were
bristling
with
german
wireless
outfits
i
a
notion
to
write
updike
lizzie
and
find
out
whether
he
knows
anything
about
wireless
telegraphy
she
said
only
there
so
little
time
perhaps
i
can
find
a
book
that
gives
the
code
this
is
only
pertinent
as
showing
tish
state
of
mind
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
did
not
write
to
updike
at
all
well
we
started
at
last
and
i
must
say
they
let
us
over
the
border
with
a
glance
but
they
asked
us
whether
we
had
any
firearms
trunk
contained
a
shotgun
and
a
revolver
but
she
had
packed
over
the
top
her
most
intimate
personal
belongings
and
they
were
not
disturbed
have
you
any
weapons
asked
the
inspector
do
we
look
like
persons
carrying
weapons
tish
demanded
haughtily
and
of
course
we
did
not
still
there
was
an
untruth
of
the
spirit
and
none
of
us
felt
any
too
comfortable
indeed
what
followed
may
have
been
a
punishment
on
us
for
deceit
and
conspiracy
aggie
had
taken
her
cat
along
because
it
was
so
fond
of
fish
she
said
and
between
tish
buying
ice
for
the
worms
and
aggie
getting
milk
for
the
cat
the
journey
was
not
monotonous
but
on
returning
from
one
of
her
excursions
to
the
tish
put
a
heavy
hand
on
my
shoulder
that
boy
on
the
train
lizzie
she
said
he
had
the
impudence
to
ask
me
whether
i
still
drive
with
the
license
plates
under
a
cushion
english
roses
importations
said
tish
and
sniffed
you
do
suppose
he
went
into
that
tent
shop
and
asked
about
us
he
might
i
retorted
but
on
the
other
hand
there
no
reason
why
our
going
to
canada
should
keep
the
rest
of
the
united
states
at
home
however
the
thing
did
seem
queer
somehow
why
had
he
told
us
things
that
were
not
so
why
had
he
been
so
anxious
to
know
who
we
were
why
had
he
asked
us
to
take
the
picnic
to
a
place
that
did
not
belong
to
him
he
may
be
going
away
to
forget
some
trouble
you
remember
what
he
said
about
happier
days
said
tish
that
was
updike
reason
too
i
relied
poignant
grief
for
just
a
moment
our
eyes
met
the
same
suspicion
had
occurred
to
us
both
well
we
agreed
to
say
nothing
to
aggie
or
hutchins
for
fear
of
upsetting
them
and
the
next
hour
or
so
was
peaceful
hutchins
read
and
aggie
slept
tish
and
i
strung
beads
for
the
indians
and
watched
the
door
into
the
next
car
and
sure
enough
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
he
appeared
and
stared
in
at
us
he
watched
us
for
quite
a
time
smoking
a
cigarette
as
he
did
so
then
he
came
in
and
bent
down
over
tish
you
did
take
the
children
out
for
the
picnic
did
you
he
said
i
did
not
tish
snapped
i
sorry
never
saw
the
place
look
so
well
look
here
tish
said
putting
down
her
beads
what
were
you
doing
there
that
night
anyhow
you
do
belong
to
the
family
he
looked
surprised
and
then
grieved
you
discovered
that
have
you
he
said
i
did
you
know
word
of
honor
they
turned
me
off
but
i
love
the
old
place
still
and
on
summer
nights
i
wander
about
it
recalling
happier
days
hutchins
closed
her
book
with
a
snap
and
he
sighed
i
perceive
that
we
are
overheard
he
said
some
time
i
hope
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
it
extremely
sad
i
not
spoil
the
beginning
of
your
holiday
with
it
all
the
time
he
had
been
talking
he
held
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
when
he
left
us
tish
went
back
thoughtfully
to
her
beads
it
just
shows
lizzie
she
said
how
wrong
we
are
to
trust
to
appearances
that
poor
boy
i
had
stooped
into
the
aisle
and
was
picking
up
the
piece
of
paper
which
he
had
accidentally
dropped
as
he
passed
hutchins
i
opened
it
and
read
aloud
to
tish
and
aggie
who
had
wakened
you
not
get
away
with
it
the
man
in
the
car
behind
is
a
man
tish
has
a
large
fund
of
general
knowledge
gained
through
charlie
sands
so
what
aggie
and
i
failed
to
understand
she
interpreted
at
once
a
man
she
explained
is
a
detective
dressed
as
a
gentleman
it
as
plain
as
pikestaff
the
boy
received
this
warning
and
dropped
it
he
has
done
something
he
should
and
is
escaping
to
canada
i
do
not
believe
however
that
we
should
have
thought
of
his
being
a
political
spy
but
for
the
conductor
of
the
train
he
proved
to
be
a
very
nice
person
with
eight
children
and
a
toupee
and
he
said
that
canada
was
honeycombed
with
spies
in
the
pay
of
the
german
government
they
sending
wireless
messages
all
the
time
probably
from
remote
places
he
said
and
of
course
their
play
now
is
to
blow
up
the
transcontinental
railroads
of
course
the
railroads
have
an
army
of
detectives
on
the
watch
good
heavens
aggie
said
and
turned
pale
well
our
pleasure
in
the
journey
was
ruined
every
time
the
whistle
blew
on
the
engine
we
quailed
and
tish
wrote
her
will
then
and
there
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
it
was
while
she
was
writing
that
the
truth
came
to
her
that
boy
she
said
do
you
see
it
all
that
note
was
a
warning
to
him
he
a
spy
and
the
man
is
after
him
none
of
us
slept
that
night
though
tish
did
a
very
courageous
thing
about
eleven
when
she
was
ready
for
bed
i
went
with
her
we
had
put
our
over
our
nightrobes
and
we
went
back
to
the
car
containing
the
spy
he
had
not
retired
but
was
sitting
alone
staring
ahead
moodily
the
man
was
getting
ready
for
bed
just
opposite
tish
spoke
loudly
so
the
detective
should
hear
i
have
come
back
tish
said
to
say
that
we
know
everything
a
word
to
the
wise
mister
happier
days
do
try
any
of
your
tricks
he
sat
with
his
mouth
quite
open
and
stared
at
us
but
the
man
pretended
to
hear
nothing
and
took
off
his
other
shoe
none
of
us
slept
at
all
except
hutchins
though
we
had
told
her
nothing
she
seemed
inherently
to
distrust
the
spy
when
on
arriving
at
the
town
where
we
were
to
take
the
boat
he
offered
to
help
her
off
with
cat
basket
which
she
was
carrying
she
snubbed
him
i
can
do
it
myself
she
said
coldly
and
if
you
know
when
you
well
off
you
go
back
to
where
you
came
from
something
might
happen
to
you
here
in
the
wilderness
i
wish
it
would
he
replied
in
quite
a
tragic
manner
as
tish
said
then
a
man
is
probably
often
forced
by
circumstances
into
hateful
situations
no
spy
can
really
want
to
be
a
spy
with
every
brick
wall
suggesting
as
it
must
a
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
we
took
the
little
steamer
that
goes
up
the
river
three
times
a
week
to
take
groceries
and
mail
to
the
and
the
spy
and
the
detective
went
along
the
spy
seemed
to
have
quite
a
lot
of
luggage
but
the
detective
had
only
a
suitcase
tish
watching
the
detective
said
his
expression
grew
more
and
more
anxious
as
we
proceeded
up
the
river
cottages
gave
place
to
and
these
to
rocky
islands
with
no
sign
of
life
still
the
spy
stayed
on
the
steamer
and
so
of
course
did
the
detective
tish
went
down
and
examined
the
luggage
she
reported
that
the
spy
was
traveling
under
the
name
of
mcdonald
and
that
the
detective
suitcase
was
unmarked
mcdonald
had
some
boxes
and
a
green
canoe
the
detective
had
nothing
at
all
there
were
no
other
passengers
we
let
aggie
cat
out
on
the
boat
and
he
caught
a
mouse
almost
immediately
and
laid
it
in
the
most
touching
manner
at
the
feet
but
he
was
in
a
very
bad
humor
and
flung
it
over
the
rail
shortly
after
that
he
asked
tish
whether
she
intended
to
go
to
the
arctic
circle
i
do
know
that
that
any
concern
of
yours
tish
said
you
not
after
me
you
know
he
looked
startled
and
muttered
something
into
his
mustache
it
perfectly
clear
what
wrong
with
him
tish
said
he
got
to
stick
to
mcdonald
and
he
has
got
a
tent
in
that
suitcase
or
even
a
blanket
i
do
suppose
he
knows
where
his
next
meal
coming
from
she
was
probably
right
for
i
saw
the
crew
of
the
boat
packing
a
box
or
two
of
crackers
and
an
old
comfort
into
a
box
and
aggie
overheard
the
detective
say
to
the
captain
that
if
he
would
sell
him
some
fishhooks
he
would
not
starve
anyhow
tish
found
an
island
that
suited
her
about
three
that
afternoon
and
we
disembarked
mcdonald
insisted
on
helping
the
crew
with
our
stuff
which
they
piled
on
a
large
flat
rock
but
the
detective
stood
on
the
upper
deck
and
scowled
down
at
us
tish
suggested
that
he
was
a
they
know
so
many
lawbreaking
women
she
said
it
quite
natural
having
landed
us
the
boat
went
across
to
another
island
and
deposited
mcdonald
and
the
green
canoe
tish
who
had
talked
about
a
lodge
in
some
vast
wilderness
complained
at
that
but
when
the
detective
got
off
on
a
little
tongue
of
the
mainland
in
sight
of
both
islands
she
said
the
place
was
getting
crowded
and
she
had
a
notion
to
go
farther
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
sit
on
a
box
and
open
a
map
the
canadian
pacific
was
only
a
few
miles
away
through
the
woods
hutchins
proved
herself
a
treasure
she
could
work
all
round
the
three
of
us
she
opened
boxes
and
a
can
of
beans
for
supper
with
the
same
hatchet
and
had
tea
made
and
the
beans
heated
while
tish
was
selecting
a
site
for
the
tent
but
and
i
remembered
this
later
she
watched
the
river
at
intervals
with
her
cheeks
like
roses
from
the
exertion
she
was
really
a
pretty
girl
only
when
no
one
was
looking
her
mouth
that
day
had
a
way
of
setting
itself
firmly
and
she
frowned
at
the
water
we
hutchins
and
i
set
up
the
stove
against
a
large
rock
and
when
the
teakettle
started
to
boil
it
gave
the
river
front
a
homey
look
sitting
on
my
beside
the
stove
with
a
cup
of
tea
in
my
hand
and
a
plate
of
beans
on
a
doily
on
a
beside
me
i
was
entirely
comfortable
through
the
glasses
i
could
see
the
man
on
the
other
shore
sitting
on
a
rock
with
his
head
in
his
hands
but
mcdonald
had
clearly
located
on
the
other
side
of
his
island
and
was
not
in
sight
aggie
and
tish
were
putting
up
the
tent
and
hutchins
was
feeding
the
tea
grounds
to
the
worms
which
had
traveled
comfortably
when
i
saw
a
canoe
coming
up
the
river
i
called
to
tish
about
it
an
indian
she
said
calmly
get
the
beads
aggie
and
put
my
shotgun
on
that
rock
where
he
can
see
it
she
stood
and
watched
him
primitive
man
every
inch
of
him
she
went
on
notice
his
uncovered
head
notice
the
freedom
almost
the
savagery
of
the
way
he
uses
that
paddle
i
wish
he
would
sing
you
remember
in
hiawatha
how
they
sing
as
they
paddle
along
she
got
the
beads
and
went
to
the
water
edge
but
the
indian
stooped
just
then
and
picking
up
a
panama
hat
put
it
on
his
head
i
have
called
he
said
to
see
whether
i
can
interest
you
in
a
set
of
books
i
am
selling
i
shall
detain
you
only
a
moment
steel
engravings
by
artists
best
paper
and
the
work
itself
is
of
high
educational
value
tish
suddenly
put
the
beads
behind
her
back
and
said
we
did
not
expect
to
have
any
time
to
read
we
had
come
into
the
wilderness
to
rest
our
minds
you
are
wrong
i
fear
said
the
indian
personally
i
find
that
i
can
read
better
in
the
wilds
than
anywhere
else
great
thoughts
in
great
surroundings
i
take
nietzsche
with
me
when
i
go
fishing
tish
had
the
wretched
beads
behind
her
all
the
time
and
to
make
conversation
more
than
anything
else
she
asked
about
venison
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
fenimore
cooper
had
not
prepared
us
for
an
indian
who
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
indians
are
allowed
to
kill
deer
he
said
but
i
fear
you
are
prohibited
i
am
not
even
permitted
to
sell
it
i
should
think
said
tish
sharply
that
since
we
are
miles
from
a
game
warden
you
could
safely
sell
us
a
steak
or
two
he
gazed
at
her
disapprovingly
i
should
not
care
to
break
the
law
madam
he
said
then
he
picked
up
his
paddle
and
took
himself
and
his
scruples
and
his
paper
and
his
steel
engravings
down
the
river
primitive
man
i
said
to
tish
from
my
chair
notice
the
freedom
almost
the
savagery
with
which
he
swings
that
paddle
we
had
brought
a
volume
of
cooper
along
not
so
much
to
read
as
to
remind
us
how
to
address
the
indians
tish
said
nothing
but
she
got
the
book
and
flung
it
far
out
into
the
river
there
were
a
number
of
small
annoyances
the
first
day
or
two
hutchins
was
having
trouble
with
the
motor
launch
which
the
steamer
had
towed
up
the
day
we
came
and
which
she
called
the
mebbe
and
another
civilized
indian
with
a
gold
watch
and
a
cigarette
case
had
rented
us
a
leaky
canoe
for
a
dollar
a
day
we
patched
the
leak
with
chewing
gum
which
aggie
always
carried
for
indigestion
and
it
did
fairly
well
so
long
as
the
gum
lasted
then
on
the
second
night
there
was
a
little
wind
and
the
tent
collapsed
on
us
the
ridgepole
taking
aggie
across
the
chest
it
was
that
same
night
i
think
when
aggie
cat
found
a
porcupine
in
the
woods
and
came
in
looking
like
a
pincushion
what
with
chopping
firewood
for
the
stove
and
carrying
water
and
bailing
out
the
canoe
and
with
the
motor
boat
giving
one
gasp
and
then
dying
for
every
hundred
times
somebody
turned
over
the
engine
we
had
no
time
to
fish
for
two
days
the
police
agent
fished
all
day
from
a
rock
for
of
course
he
had
no
boat
but
he
seemed
to
catch
nothing
at
times
we
saw
him
digging
frantically
as
though
for
worms
what
he
dug
with
i
do
not
know
but
of
course
he
got
no
worms
tish
said
if
he
had
been
more
civil
she
would
have
taken
something
to
him
and
a
can
of
worms
but
he
had
been
rude
especially
to
aggie
cat
and
probably
the
boat
would
bring
him
things
what
with
getting
settled
and
everything
we
had
not
much
time
to
think
about
the
spy
it
was
on
the
third
day
i
believe
that
he
brought
his
green
canoe
to
the
open
water
in
front
of
us
and
anchored
there
just
beyond
earshot
he
put
out
a
line
and
opened
a
book
and
from
that
time
on
he
was
a
part
of
the
landscape
every
day
from
to
at
noon
he
would
eat
some
sort
of
a
lunch
reading
as
he
ate
he
apparently
never
looked
toward
us
but
he
was
always
there
it
was
the
most
extraordinary
thing
at
first
we
thought
he
had
found
a
remarkable
but
he
seemed
to
catch
very
few
fish
it
was
tish
i
think
who
found
the
best
explanation
he
providing
himself
with
an
alibi
she
stated
how
can
he
be
a
spy
when
we
see
him
all
day
long
do
you
see
how
clever
it
is
it
was
the
more
annoying
because
we
had
arranged
a
small
cove
for
bathing
hanging
up
a
rod
for
and
suspending
a
and
a
from
an
overhanging
branch
the
cove
was
well
shielded
by
brush
and
rocks
from
the
island
but
naturally
was
open
to
the
river
it
was
directly
opposite
this
cove
that
mcdonald
took
up
his
position
this
compelled
us
to
bathe
in
the
early
morning
while
the
water
was
still
cold
and
resulted
in
causing
aggie
a
most
uncomfortable
on
the
fourth
morning
of
our
stay
she
was
the
last
one
in
the
pool
and
tish
took
her
bathrobe
and
slippers
back
to
the
camp
when
she
went
tish
went
out
in
the
canoe
shortly
after
she
was
learning
to
use
one
with
a
life
preserver
on
tish
of
course
not
the
canoe
and
mcdonald
arriving
soon
after
aggie
was
compelled
to
sit
in
the
water
for
two
hours
and
twenty
minutes
when
hutchins
found
her
she
was
quite
blue
this
was
the
only
disagreement
we
had
all
summer
aggie
refusing
to
speak
to
tish
that
entire
day
she
said
mcdonald
had
seen
her
head
and
thought
it
was
some
sort
of
swimming
animal
and
had
shot
at
her
mcdonald
said
afterward
he
knew
her
all
the
time
and
was
uncertain
whether
she
was
taking
a
cure
for
something
or
was
trying
to
commit
suicide
he
said
he
spent
a
wretched
morning
at
five
that
evening
we
began
to
hear
a
curious
tapping
noise
from
the
spy
island
it
would
last
for
a
time
stop
and
go
on
hutchins
said
it
was
woodpeckers
but
tish
looked
at
me
significantly
wireless
she
said
what
did
i
tell
you
that
decided
her
next
move
for
that
evening
she
put
some
tea
and
canned
corn
and
a
rubber
blanket
into
the
canoe
and
in
fear
and
trembling
i
went
with
her
it
going
to
rain
lizzie
she
said
and
after
all
that
detective
may
be
surly
but
he
doing
his
duty
by
his
country
it
just
as
heroic
to
follow
a
spy
up
here
and
starve
to
death
watching
him
as
it
is
to
storm
a
trench
and
less
showy
and
i
something
to
tell
him
the
canoe
tilted
just
then
and
only
by
heroic
effort
were
we
able
to
calm
it
then
why
not
go
comfortably
in
the
motor
boat
tish
stopped
her
paddle
in
the
air
because
i
ca
make
that
dratted
engine
go
she
said
and
because
i
believe
hutchins
would
drown
us
all
before
she
take
any
help
to
him
it
my
belief
that
she
known
him
somewhere
i
seen
her
sit
on
a
rock
and
look
across
at
him
with
murder
in
her
eyes
a
little
wind
had
come
up
and
the
wretched
canoe
was
leaking
the
chewing
gum
having
come
out
tish
was
paddling
so
i
was
compelled
to
sit
over
the
aperture
thus
preventing
water
from
coming
in
despite
my
best
efforts
however
about
three
inches
seeped
in
and
washed
about
me
it
was
quite
uncomfortable
the
man
was
asleep
when
we
landed
he
had
hung
the
comfort
over
a
branch
like
a
tent
and
built
a
fire
at
the
end
of
it
he
had
his
overcoat
on
buttoned
to
the
chin
and
his
head
was
on
his
he
sat
up
and
looked
at
us
blinking
we
brought
you
some
tea
and
some
canned
corn
tish
said
and
a
rubber
blanket
it
going
to
rain
he
slid
out
of
the
tent
feet
first
and
got
up
but
when
he
tried
to
speak
he
sneezed
he
had
a
terrible
cold
i
might
as
well
say
at
once
tish
went
on
that
we
know
why
you
are
here
the
deuce
you
do
he
said
hoarsely
we
do
not
particularly
care
about
you
especially
since
the
way
you
acted
to
a
friendly
and
innocent
cat
one
can
always
judge
a
man
by
the
way
he
treats
dumb
animals
but
we
sympathize
with
your
errand
even
help
if
we
can
then
the
the
person
in
question
has
confided
in
you
not
at
all
said
tish
loftily
i
hope
we
can
put
two
and
two
together
have
you
got
a
revolver
he
looked
startled
at
that
i
have
one
he
said
but
i
guess
i
not
need
it
the
first
night
or
two
a
skunk
hung
round
two
in
fact
mother
and
child
but
i
think
they
gone
would
you
like
some
fish
my
god
no
this
is
a
truthful
narrative
that
is
exactly
what
he
said
i
tell
you
what
i
do
need
ladies
he
went
on
if
you
got
a
spare
suit
of
underwear
over
there
i
could
use
it
it
stretch
probably
and
i
like
a
pen
and
some
ink
i
must
have
lost
my
fountain
pen
out
of
my
pocket
stooping
over
the
bank
to
wash
my
face
do
you
know
the
wireless
code
tish
asked
suddenly
wireless
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
she
said
impressively
that
one
of
the
great
trees
on
that
island
conceals
a
wireless
outfit
i
see
he
edged
back
a
little
from
us
both
i
should
think
tish
said
eyeing
him
that
a
knowledge
of
the
wireless
code
would
be
essential
to
you
in
your
occupation
we
we
get
a
smattering
of
all
sorts
of
things
he
said
but
he
was
uneasy
you
could
see
that
with
half
an
eye
he
accompanied
us
down
to
the
canoe
but
once
when
tish
turned
suddenly
he
ducked
back
as
though
he
had
been
struck
and
changed
color
he
thanked
us
for
the
tea
and
corn
and
said
he
wished
we
had
a
spare
razor
but
of
course
he
supposed
not
then
i
suppose
the
the
person
in
question
will
stay
as
long
as
you
do
he
asked
rather
nervously
it
looks
like
it
said
tish
grimly
i
no
intention
of
being
driven
away
if
that
what
you
mean
we
stay
as
long
as
the
good
he
groaned
under
his
breath
the
whole
d
d
river
is
full
of
fish
he
said
they
crawled
up
the
bank
last
night
and
ate
all
the
crackers
saved
for
oh
i
pay
somebody
out
for
this
all
right
good
gracious
ladies
your
boat
full
of
water
it
has
a
hole
in
it
tish
replied
and
upturned
it
to
empty
it
when
he
saw
the
hole
his
eyes
stuck
out
you
ca
go
out
in
that
leaky
canoe
it
suicidal
not
at
all
tish
assured
him
my
friend
here
will
sit
on
the
leak
get
in
quick
lizzie
it
filling
the
last
we
saw
of
the
detective
that
night
he
was
standing
on
the
bank
staring
after
us
afterward
when
a
good
many
things
were
cleared
up
he
said
he
decided
that
he
been
asleep
and
dreamed
the
whole
thing
the
wireless
and
my
sitting
on
the
hole
in
the
canoe
and
the
wind
tossing
it
about
and
everything
only
of
course
there
was
the
tea
and
the
canned
corn
we
did
our
first
fishing
the
next
day
hutchins
had
got
the
motor
boat
going
and
i
put
over
the
spoon
i
had
made
from
the
feather
duster
after
going
a
mile
or
so
slowly
i
felt
a
tug
and
on
drawing
my
line
in
i
found
i
had
captured
a
large
fish
i
wrapped
the
line
about
a
part
of
the
engine
and
tish
put
the
barrel
hoop
with
the
netting
underneath
it
the
fish
was
really
quite
large
about
four
feet
i
think
and
it
broke
through
the
netting
i
wished
to
hit
it
with
the
oar
but
hutchins
said
that
might
break
the
fin
and
free
it
unluckily
we
had
not
brought
tish
gun
or
we
might
have
shot
it
at
last
we
turned
the
boat
round
and
went
home
the
fish
swimming
alongside
with
its
mouth
open
and
there
aggie
who
is
occasionally
almost
inspired
landed
the
fish
by
the
simple
expedient
of
getting
out
of
the
boat
taking
the
line
up
a
bank
and
wrapping
it
round
a
tree
by
all
pulling
together
we
landed
the
fish
successfully
it
was
inches
by
tish
tape
measure
tish
did
not
sleep
well
that
night
she
dreamed
that
the
fish
had
a
red
mustache
and
was
a
spy
in
disguise
when
she
woke
she
declared
there
was
somebody
prowling
round
the
tent
she
got
her
shotgun
and
we
all
sat
up
in
bed
for
an
hour
or
so
nothing
happened
however
except
that
aggie
cried
out
that
there
was
a
small
animal
just
inside
the
door
of
the
tent
we
could
see
it
too
though
faintly
tish
turned
the
shotgun
on
it
and
it
disappeared
but
the
next
morning
she
found
she
had
shot
one
of
her
shoes
to
pieces
iii
it
was
the
day
tish
began
her
diary
that
we
discovered
the
man
signal
tish
was
compelled
to
remain
at
home
most
of
the
day
breaking
in
another
pair
of
shoes
and
she
amused
herself
by
watching
the
river
and
writing
down
interesting
things
she
had
read
somewhere
of
the
value
of
such
records
of
impressions
gull
on
rock
very
pretty
frightened
away
by
the
mcdonald
person
who
has
just
taken
up
his
customary
position
is
he
reading
or
watching
this
camp
detective
is
breakfasting
through
glasses
he
is
eating
canned
corn
aggie
pickerel
from
bank
aggie
cat
beside
her
has
caught
a
small
fish
aggie
declares
that
the
cat
stole
one
of
her
worms
and
held
it
in
the
water
i
think
she
is
mistaken
most
extraordinary
thing
hutchins
has
asked
permission
to
take
pen
and
ink
across
to
the
detective
have
consented
hutchins
is
still
across
the
river
if
i
did
not
know
differently
i
should
say
she
and
the
detective
are
quarreling
he
is
whittling
something
through
glasses
she
appears
to
stamp
her
foot
aggie
has
captured
a
small
sunfish
hutchins
is
still
across
the
river
he
seems
to
be
appealing
to
her
for
something
possibly
the
underwear
we
have
none
to
spare
hutchins
is
an
extraordinary
girl
she
hates
men
evidently
she
has
had
some
sort
of
quarrel
with
the
detective
and
has
returned
flushed
with
battle
mcdonald
called
to
her
as
she
passed
but
she
ignored
him
noon
really
there
is
something
mysterious
about
all
this
the
detective
was
evidently
whittling
a
flagpole
he
has
erected
it
now
with
a
red
silk
handkerchief
at
end
it
hangs
out
over
the
water
aggie
bass
but
under
legal
size
the
flag
puzzles
hutchins
she
is
covertly
watching
it
it
is
evidently
a
signal
but
to
whom
are
the
men
closing
in
on
mcdonald
aggie
pike
on
consulting
map
find
unnamed
lake
only
a
few
miles
away

investigate
steamer

just
gone
detective
now

canoe
blue
in
color

he
sent
off
his
letter
fed
worms
lizzie
thinks
they
know
me
how
kindness
is
its
own
reward
mcdonald
is
drawing
in
his
anchor
which
is
a
large
stone
fastened
to
a
rope
shall
take
bath
tish
notes
ended
here
she
did
not
take
the
bath
after
all
for
mcdonald
made
us
a
call
that
afternoon
he
beached
the
green
canoe
and
came
up
the
rocks
calmly
and
smilingly
hutchins
gave
him
a
cold
glance
and
went
on
with
what
she
was
doing
which
was
chopping
a
plank
to
cook
the
fish
on
he
bowed
cheerfully
to
all
of
us
and
laid
a
string
of
fish
on
a
rock
i
brought
a
little
offering
he
said
looking
at
hutchins
back
the
fishing
is
what
i
expected
but
if
the
young
lady
with
the
hatchet
will
desist
so
i
can
make
myself
heard
i
found
a
place
where
there
are
fish
this
biggest
fellow
is
three
and
a
quarter
pounds
hutchins
chopped
harder
than
ever
and
the
plank
flew
up
striking
her
in
the
chest
but
she
refused
all
assistance
especially
from
mcdonald
who
was
really
concerned
he
hurried
to
her
and
took
the
hatchet
out
of
her
hand
but
in
his
excitement
he
was
almost
uncivil
you
obstinate
little
idiot
he
said
you
kill
yourself
yet
to
my
surprise
hutchins
who
had
been
entirely
unemotional
right
along
suddenly
burst
into
tears
and
went
into
the
tent
mcdonald
took
a
hasty
step
or
two
after
her
realizing
no
doubt
that
he
had
said
more
than
he
should
to
a
complete
stranger
but
she
closed
the
fly
of
the
tent
quite
viciously
and
left
him
standing
with
his
arms
folded
staring
at
it
it
was
at
that
moment
he
saw
the
large
fish
hanging
from
a
tree
he
stood
for
a
moment
staring
at
it
and
we
could
see
that
he
was
quite
surprised
it
is
a
fish
is
it
he
said
after
a
moment
i
i
thought
for
a
moment
it
was
painted
on
something
he
sat
down
suddenly
on
one
of
our
and
looked
at
the
fish
and
then
at
each
of
us
in
turn
you
know
he
said
i
did
think
there
were
such
fish
i
you
must
mind
my
surprise
he
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
just
kick
those
things
i
brought
into
the
river
will
you
i
apologize
for
them
inches
tish
said
we
expect
to
do
better
when
we
really
get
started
this
evening
we
shall
go
after
its
mate
which
is
probably
hanging
round
its
mate
he
said
rather
dazed
oh
i
see
of
course
he
still
seemed
to
doubt
his
senses
for
he
went
over
and
touched
it
with
his
finger
ladies
he
said
i
not
going
after
the
the
mate
i
could
land
it
if
i
did
get
it
i
am
going
to
retire
from
the
game
except
for
food
but
i
wish
for
the
sake
of
my
reason
you
tell
me
what
you
caught
it
with
well
you
may
heartily
distrust
a
person
but
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
answer
a
simple
question
so
i
showed
him
the
thing
i
had
made
and
he
did
not
believe
me
you
perfectly
right
he
said
every
game
has
its
secrets
i
had
no
business
to
ask
but
you
have
caught
me
with
that
thing
any
more
than
you
caught
that
fish
with
it
i
do
mind
your
not
telling
me
that
your
privilege
but
is
it
rather
rubbing
it
in
to
make
fun
of
me
nothing
of
the
sort
aggie
said
angrily
if
you
had
caught
it
my
dear
lady
he
said
i
could
have
caught
it
the
mere
shock
of
getting
such
a
bite
would
have
sent
me
out
of
my
boat
in
a
swoon
he
turned
to
tish
i
have
only
one
disappointment
he
said
that
it
was
one
of
worms
that
did
the
work
tish
said
afterward
she
was
positively
sorry
for
him
he
looked
so
crestfallen
so
when
he
started
for
his
canoe
she
followed
him
look
here
she
said
you
young
and
i
do
want
to
see
you
get
into
trouble
go
home
young
man
there
are
plenty
of
others
to
take
your
place
he
looked
rather
startled
that
it
exactly
he
said
after
a
moment
as
well
as
i
can
make
out
there
are
about
a
hundred
if
you
think
he
said
fiercely
raising
his
voice
that
i
going
to
back
out
and
let
somebody
else
in
i
not
and
that
flat
it
a
matter
said
tish
you
bet
it
a
matter
and
what
about
the
the
man
over
there
his
reply
amazed
us
all
he
harmless
he
said
i
do
like
him
naturally
but
i
admire
the
way
he
holds
on
he
making
the
best
of
a
bad
business
do
you
know
why
he
here
he
looked
uneasy
for
once
well
i
got
a
theory
he
replied
but
though
his
voice
was
calm
he
changed
color
then
perhaps
you
tell
me
what
that
signal
means
tish
gave
him
the
glasses
and
he
saw
the
red
flag
i
have
never
seen
a
man
look
so
unhappy
holy
cats
he
said
and
almost
dropped
the
glasses
why
he
he
must
be
expecting
somebody
so
i
should
imagine
tish
commented
dryly
he
sent
a
letter
by
the
boat
the
h
l
he
did
and
then
that
ridiculous
you
mistaken
as
a
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
went
over
there
the
other
night
and
commandeered
his
fountain
pen
so
it
had
not
fallen
out
of
his
pocket
i
be
frank
ladies
he
said
it
my
object
just
now
to
keep
that
chap
from
writing
letters
it
does
matter
why
but
it
vital
he
was
horribly
cast
down
when
we
told
him
about
hutchins
and
the
pen
and
ink
so
that
it
he
said
gloomily
and
the
flag
a
signal
of
course
ladies
you
have
done
it
out
of
the
kindness
of
your
hearts
i
know
but
i
think
you
have
wrecked
my
life
he
took
a
gloomy
departure
and
left
us
all
rather
wrought
up
who
were
we
as
tish
said
to
imperil
a
fellow
man
and
another
thing
if
there
was
a
reward
on
him
why
should
we
give
it
to
a
detective
who
was
rude
to
harmless
animals
and
ate
canned
corn
for
breakfast
with
her
customary
acumen
tish
solved
the
difficulty
that
very
evening
the
simplest
thing
she
said
of
course
would
be
to
go
over
during
the
night
and
take
the
flag
away
but
he
may
have
more
red
handkerchiefs
then
too
he
seems
to
be
a
light
sleeper
and
it
would
be
awkward
to
have
him
shoot
at
us
she
sat
in
thought
for
quite
a
while
hutchins
was
watching
the
sunset
and
seemed
depressed
and
silent
tish
lowered
her
voice
there
no
reason
why
we
should
have
a
red
flag
too
she
said
it
gives
us
an
even
chance
to
get
in
on
whatever
is
about
to
happen
we
can
warn
mcdonald
for
one
thing
if
any
one
comes
here
personally
i
think
he
is
unjustly
suspected
but
tish
was
to
change
her
mind
very
soon
we
made
the
flag
that
night
by
lantern
light
out
of
tish
red
silk
petticoat
hutchins
was
curious
i
am
sure
but
we
explained
nothing
and
we
fastened
it
obliquely
over
the
river
like
the
one
on
the
other
side
tish
change
of
heart
which
occurred
the
next
morning
was
due
to
a
most
unfortunate
accident
that
happened
to
her
at
nine
hutchins
who
could
swim
like
a
duck
was
teaching
tish
to
swim
and
she
was
learning
nicely
tish
had
put
a
on
with
a
fastened
to
it
and
aggie
was
sitting
on
the
bank
holding
the
rope
while
she
went
through
the
various
gestures
having
completed
the
lesson
hutchins
went
into
the
woods
for
red
raspberries
leaving
tish
still
practicing
in
the
water
with
aggie
holding
the
rope
happening
to
sneeze
the
line
slipped
out
of
her
hand
and
she
had
the
agonizing
experience
of
seeing
tish
carried
away
by
the
current
i
was
washing
some
clothing
in
the
river
a
few
yards
down
the
stream
when
tish
came
floating
past
i
shall
never
forget
her
expression
or
my
own
sense
of
absolute
helplessness
get
the
canoe
said
tish
and
follow
i
heading
for
island
eleven
illustration
get
the
canoe
and
follow
i
heading
for
island
eleven
she
was
quite
calm
though
pale
but
in
her
anxiety
to
keep
well
above
the
water
she
did
what
was
almost
a
fatal
thing
she
pushed
the
lower
down
round
her
body
and
having
shifted
the
floating
center
so
to
speak
without
warning
her
head
disappeared
and
her
feet
rose
in
the
air
for
a
time
it
looked
as
though
she
would
drown
in
that
position
but
tish
rarely
loses
her
presence
of
mind
she
said
she
knew
at
once
what
was
wrong
so
though
somewhat
handicapped
by
the
position
she
replaced
the
cork
belt
under
her
arms
and
emerged
at
last
aggie
had
started
back
into
the
woods
for
hutchins
but
with
one
thing
and
another
it
was
almost
ten
before
they
returned
together
tish
by
that
time
was
only
a
dot
on
the
horizon
through
the
binocular
having
missed
island
eleven
as
she
explained
later
by
the
rope
being
caught
on
a
submerged
log
which
deflected
her
course
we
got
into
the
motor
boat
and
followed
her
and
except
for
a
most
unjust
sense
of
irritation
that
i
had
not
drowned
myself
by
following
her
in
the
canoe
she
was
unharmed
we
got
her
into
the
motor
boat
and
into
a
blanket
and
aggie
gave
her
some
blackberry
cordial
at
once
it
was
some
time
before
her
teeth
ceased
chattering
so
she
could
speak
when
she
did
it
was
to
announce
that
she
had
made
a
discovery
he
a
spy
all
right
she
said
and
that
indian
is
another
neither
of
them
saw
me
as
i
floated
past
they
were
on
island
eleven
mcdonald
wrote
something
and
gave
it
to
the
indian
it
was
a
letter
or
he
have
sent
it
by
the
boat
he
did
even
put
it
in
an
envelope
so
far
as
i
could
see
it
probably
in
cipher
well
we
took
her
home
and
she
had
a
boiled
egg
at
dinner
the
rest
of
us
had
fish
it
is
one
of
tish
theories
that
fish
should
only
be
captured
for
food
and
that
all
fish
caught
must
be
eaten
i
do
not
know
when
i
have
seen
fish
come
as
easy
perhaps
it
was
the
worms
which
had
grown
both
long
and
fat
so
that
one
was
too
much
for
a
hook
and
we
cut
them
with
scissors
like
tape
or
ribbon
aggie
and
i
finally
got
so
sick
of
fish
that
while
tish
head
was
turned
we
dropped
in
our
lines
without
bait
but
even
at
that
aggie
reeling
in
her
line
to
go
home
caught
a
bass
through
the
gills
and
could
not
shake
it
off
we
tried
to
persuade
tish
to
lie
down
that
afternoon
but
she
refused
i
not
sick
she
said
even
if
you
two
idiots
did
try
to
drown
me
and
i
on
the
track
of
something
if
that
was
a
letter
why
did
he
send
it
by
the
boat
just
then
her
eye
fell
on
the
flagpole
and
we
followed
her
horrified
gaze
the
flag
had
been
neatly
cut
away
tish
eyes
narrowed
she
looked
positively
dangerous
and
within
five
minutes
she
had
cut
another
flag
out
of
the
back
breadth
of
the
petticoat
and
flung
it
defiantly
in
the
air
who
had
cut
away
the
signal
mcdonald
or
the
detective
we
had
planned
to
investigate
the
nameless
lake
that
afternoon
tish
being
like
colonel
roosevelt
in
her
thirst
for
information
as
well
as
in
the
grim
pugnacity
that
is
her
dominant
characteristic
but
at
the
last
minute
she
decided
not
to
go
you
and
aggie
go
lizzie
she
said
i
got
something
on
hand
tish
aggie
wailed
you
drown
yourself
or
something
do
be
a
fool
tish
snapped
there
a
portage
but
you
and
lizzie
can
carry
the
canoe
across
on
your
heads
i
seen
pictures
of
it
easy
and
keep
your
eyes
open
for
a
wireless
outfit
there
one
about
that
sure
lots
of
good
it
will
do
to
keep
our
eyes
open
i
said
with
some
bitterness
with
our
heads
inside
the
canoe
we
finally
started
and
hutchins
went
with
us
it
was
hutchins
too
who
voiced
the
way
we
all
felt
when
we
had
crossed
the
river
and
were
preparing
for
what
she
called
the
portage
she
wants
to
get
us
out
of
the
way
miss
lizzie
she
said
can
you
imagine
what
mischief
she
up
to
that
is
not
a
polite
way
to
speak
of
miss
tish
hutchins
i
said
coldly
nevertheless
my
heart
sank
hutchins
and
i
carried
the
canoe
it
was
a
hot
day
and
there
was
no
path
aggie
who
likes
a
cup
of
hot
tea
at
five
had
brought
along
a
bottle
filled
with
tea
and
a
small
basket
containing
sugar
and
cups
personally
i
never
had
less
curiosity
about
a
lake
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
wished
there
was
no
lake
twice
being
obliged
as
it
were
to
walk
blindly
and
the
canoe
being
excessively
heavy
i
who
led
the
way
ran
the
front
end
of
the
thing
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
both
hutchins
and
i
sat
down
violently
under
the
canoe
as
a
result
of
the
impact
to
add
to
the
discomfort
of
the
situation
aggie
declared
that
we
were
being
followed
by
a
bear
and
at
the
same
instant
stepped
into
a
swamp
up
to
her
knees
she
became
calm
at
once
with
the
calmness
of
despair
go
and
leave
me
lizzie
she
said
he
is
just
behind
those
bushes
i
may
sink
before
he
gets
me
that
one
comfort
hutchins
found
a
log
and
standing
on
it
tried
to
pull
her
up
but
she
seemed
firmly
fastened
aggie
went
quite
white
and
almost
beside
myself
i
poured
her
a
cup
of
hot
tea
which
she
drank
i
remember
she
murmured
wiggins
name
and
immediately
after
she
yelled
that
the
bear
was
coming
it
was
however
the
detective
who
emerged
from
the
bushes
he
got
aggie
out
with
one
good
heave
leaving
both
her
shoes
gone
forever
and
while
she
collapsed
whimpering
he
folded
his
arms
and
stared
at
all
of
us
angrily
what
sort
of
damnable
idiocy
is
this
he
demanded
in
a
most
unpleasant
tone
aggie
revived
and
sat
upright
that
our
affair
is
it
said
hutchins
curtly
not
by
a
blamed
sight
was
his
astonishing
reply
the
next
time
i
am
sinking
in
a
morass
let
me
sink
aggie
said
with
simple
dignity
he
did
not
speak
another
word
but
gave
each
of
us
a
glance
of
the
most
deadly
contempt
and
finished
up
with
hutchins
what
i
do
understand
he
said
furiously
is
why
you
have
to
lend
yourself
to
this
senile
idiocy
because
some
old
women
choose
to
sink
themselves
in
a
swamp
is
no
reason
why
you
should
commit
suicide
aggie
said
afterward
only
the
recollection
that
he
had
saved
her
life
prevented
her
emptying
the
tea
on
him
i
should
hardly
have
known
hutchins
naturally
she
said
in
a
voice
thick
with
fury
you
are
in
a
position
to
insult
these
ladies
and
you
do
but
i
warn
you
if
you
intend
to
keep
on
this
swamp
is
nothing
we
like
it
here
we
may
stay
for
months
i
hope
you
have
your
life
insured
perhaps
we
should
have
understood
it
all
then
of
course
charlie
sands
for
whom
i
am
writing
this
will
by
this
time
with
his
keen
mind
comprehend
it
all
but
i
assure
you
we
suspected
nothing
how
simple
when
you
line
it
up
the
country
house
and
the
garden
hose
the
detective
with
no
camp
equipment
mcdonald
and
the
green
canoe
the
letter
on
the
train
the
red
flag
the
girl
in
the
pink
who
has
not
yet
appeared
but
will
shortly
mcdonald
incriminating
list
also
not
yet
but
soon
how
inevitably
they
led
to
what
charlie
sands
has
called
our
crime
the
detective
who
was
evidently
very
strong
only
glared
at
her
then
he
swung
the
canoe
up
on
his
head
and
turning
about
started
back
the
way
we
had
come
though
hutchins
and
aggie
were
raging
i
was
resigned
my
neck
was
stiff
and
my
shoulders
ached
we
finished
our
tea
in
silence
and
then
made
our
way
back
to
the
river
i
have
now
reached
tish
adventure
it
is
not
my
intention
in
this
record
to
defend
tish
she
thought
her
conclusions
were
correct
charlie
sands
says
she
is
like
shaw
she
has
got
a
crooked
point
of
view
but
she
believes
she
is
seeing
straight
and
after
a
while
if
you
look
her
way
long
enough
you
get
a
sort
of
mental
astigmatism
so
i
shall
confess
at
once
that
at
the
time
i
saw
nothing
immoral
in
what
she
did
that
afternoon
while
we
were
having
our
adventure
in
the
swamp
i
was
putting
cloths
wrung
out
of
arnica
and
hot
water
on
my
neck
when
she
came
home
and
hutchins
was
baking
biscuit
she
was
a
marvelous
cook
though
aggie
who
washed
the
dishes
objected
to
the
number
of
pans
she
used
tish
ignored
both
my
neck
and
the
biscuits
and
marching
up
the
bank
got
her
shotgun
from
the
tent
and
loaded
it
we
may
be
attacked
at
any
time
she
said
briefly
and
getting
the
binocular
she
searched
the
river
with
a
splendid
sweeping
glance
at
any
time
hutchins
take
these
glasses
please
and
watch
that
we
are
not
disturbed
i
baking
biscuit
miss
letitia
biscuit
said
tish
scornfully
biscuit
in
times
like
these
she
walked
up
to
the
camp
stove
and
threw
the
oven
door
open
but
though
i
believe
she
had
meant
to
fling
them
into
the
river
she
changed
her
mind
when
she
saw
them
open
a
jar
of
honey
hutchins
she
said
and
closed
the
oven
but
her
voice
was
abstracted
you
can
watch
the
river
from
the
stove
hutchins
she
went
on
miss
aggie
and
miss
lizzie
and
i
must
confer
together
so
we
went
into
the
tent
and
tish
closed
and
fastened
it
now
she
said
i
got
the
papers
papers
the
ones
mcdonald
gave
that
indian
this
morning
i
had
an
idea
still
have
them
you
ca
hurry
an
indian
i
waited
in
the
bushes
until
he
went
in
swimming
then
i
went
through
his
pockets
tish
carberry
cried
aggie
these
are
not
times
to
be
squeamish
tish
said
loftily
i
neutral
of
course
but
great
britain
has
had
this
war
forced
on
her
and
going
to
see
that
she
has
a
fair
show
i
ordered
all
my
stockings
from
the
same
shop
in
london
for
twenty
years
and
squarer
people
never
lived
look
at
these
how
innocent
they
look
until
one
knows
she
produced
two
papers
from
inside
her
waist
i
must
confess
that
at
first
glance
i
saw
nothing
remarkable
the
first
one
looks
said
tish
like
a
grocery
order
it
meant
to
look
like
that
it
relieved
my
mind
of
one
thing
mcdonald
got
no
wireless
or
he
would
be
sending
cipher
messages
by
an
indian
it
was
written
on
a
page
torn
out
of
a
pocket
notebook
and
the
page
was
ruled
with
an
inch
margin
at
the
left
this
was
the
document
dozen
eggs
yards
pkg
needles
anything
to
sew
a
button
on
doz
a
b
c
bass
hooks
lbs
meat
anything
so
it
is
fish
bot
ink
for
fountain
pen
tins
sardines
extractor
well
i
could
not
make
anything
of
it
but
of
course
i
have
not
mind
aggie
was
almost
as
bad
what
an
extractor
she
asked
exactly
said
tish
what
is
an
extractor
is
the
fellow
going
to
pull
teeth
no
he
needed
an
so
he
made
up
a
word
she
ran
her
finger
down
the
first
letters
of
the
second
column
she
said
triumphantly
did
i
tell
you
iv
well
there
it
was
staring
at
us
i
felt
positively
chilled
he
looked
so
young
and
agreeable
and
as
aggie
said
he
had
such
nice
teeth
and
to
know
him
for
what
he
was
it
was
tragic
but
that
was
not
all
add
the
numbers
said
tish
tons
perhaps
of
dynamite
and
that
only
part
said
tish
here
the
most
damning
thing
of
all
a
note
to
his
accomplice
damning
is
here
used
in
the
sense
of
condemnatory
we
are
none
of
us
addicted
to
profanity
we
read
the
other
paper
which
had
been
in
a
sealed
envelope
but
without
superscription
it
is
before
me
as
i
write
and
i
am
copying
it
exactly
i
shall
have
to
see
you
i
going
crazy
do
you
realize
that
this
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
me
come
to
island
eleven
wo
you
and
give
me
a
chance
to
talk
anyhow
something
has
got
to
be
done
and
done
soon
i
desperate
aggie
sneezed
three
times
in
sheer
excitement
for
anyone
can
see
how
absolutely
incriminating
the
letter
was
it
was
not
signed
but
it
was
in
the
same
writing
as
the
list
tish
who
knows
something
about
everything
said
the
writing
denoted
an
unscrupulous
and
violent
nature
the
is
especially
vicious
she
said
i
would
trust
a
man
who
made
a
like
that
to
carry
a
sick
child
to
the
doctor
the
thing
of
course
was
to
decide
at
once
what
measures
to
take
the
boat
would
not
come
again
for
two
days
and
to
send
a
letter
by
it
to
the
town
marshal
or
sheriff
or
whatever
the
official
is
in
canada
who
takes
charge
of
spies
would
be
another
loss
of
time
just
one
thing
said
tish
i
plan
this
out
and
find
some
way
to
deal
with
the
wretch
but
i
would
say
anything
to
hutchins
she
a
nice
little
thing
though
she
is
a
fool
about
a
motor
boat
there
no
case
in
scaring
her
for
some
reason
or
other
however
hutchins
was
out
of
spirits
that
night
i
hope
you
not
sick
hutchins
said
tish
no
indeed
miss
tish
you
not
eating
your
fish
i
sick
of
fish
she
said
calmly
i
eaten
so
much
fish
that
when
i
see
a
hook
i
have
a
mad
desire
to
go
and
hang
myself
on
it
fish
said
tish
grimly
is
good
for
the
brain
i
do
not
care
to
boast
but
never
has
my
mind
been
so
clear
as
it
is
now
certainly
though
tish
tone
was
severe
there
was
nothing
in
it
to
hurt
the
girl
but
she
got
up
from
the
cracker
box
on
which
she
was
sitting
with
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
do
mind
me
i
a
silly
fool
she
said
and
went
down
to
the
river
and
stood
looking
out
over
it
it
quite
spoiled
our
evening
aggie
made
her
a
hot
lemonade
and
i
believe
talked
to
her
about
wiggins
and
how
when
he
was
living
she
had
had
fits
of
weeping
without
apparent
cause
but
if
the
girl
was
in
love
as
we
surmised
she
said
nothing
about
it
she
insisted
that
it
was
too
much
fish
and
nervous
strain
about
the
mebbe
i
never
know
she
said
when
we
start
out
whether
we
going
to
get
back
or
be
marooned
and
starve
to
death
on
some
island
tish
said
afterward
that
her
subconscious
self
must
have
taken
the
word
marooned
and
played
with
it
for
in
ten
minutes
or
so
her
plan
popped
into
her
head
from
the
head
of
jove
lizzie
she
said
really
it
is
not
necessary
to
think
if
one
only
has
faith
the
supermind
does
it
all
without
effort
i
do
not
dislike
the
young
man
but
i
must
do
my
duty
tish
plan
was
simplicity
itself
we
were
to
steal
his
canoe
then
we
have
him
she
finished
the
current
too
strong
there
for
him
to
swim
to
the
mainland
he
might
try
it
and
drown
aggie
objected
spy
or
no
spy
somebody
son
war
is
no
time
to
be
tish
replied
i
confess
i
ate
little
all
that
day
at
noon
mcdonald
came
and
borrowed
two
eggs
from
us
i
sent
over
to
a
store
across
country
by
my
indian
guide
philosopher
and
friend
he
said
for
some
things
i
needed
but
i
dare
say
he
reading
byron
somewhere
and
has
forgotten
it
guide
philosopher
and
friend
i
caught
tish
eye
mcdonald
had
written
the
updike
letter
mcdonald
had
meant
to
use
our
respectability
to
take
him
across
the
border
we
gave
him
the
eggs
but
tish
said
afterward
she
was
not
deceived
for
a
moment
the
indian
has
told
him
she
said
and
he
allaying
our
suspicions
oh
he
clever
enough
the
indian
mind
and
my
own
she
quoted
from
the
updike
letter
know
canada
thoroughly
object
is
not
money
i
should
think
not
tish
stole
the
green
canoe
that
night
she
put
on
the
life
preserver
and
we
tied
the
end
of
the
rope
that
aggie
had
let
slip
to
the
canoe
the
made
it
difficult
to
paddle
tish
said
but
she
felt
more
secure
if
she
struck
a
rock
and
upset
at
least
she
would
not
drown
and
we
could
start
after
her
at
dawn
with
the
mebbe
i
be
somewhere
down
the
river
she
said
and
safe
enough
most
likely
unless
there
are
falls
hutchins
watched
in
a
puzzled
way
for
tish
did
not
leave
until
dusk
you
better
let
me
follow
you
with
the
launch
miss
tish
she
said
just
remember
that
if
the
canoe
sinks
you
tied
to
it
i
on
serious
business
hutchins
tish
said
ominously
you
are
young
and
i
refuse
to
trouble
your
young
mind
but
your
ears
are
sharp
if
you
hear
any
shooting
get
the
boat
and
follow
me
the
mention
of
shooting
made
me
very
nervous
we
watched
tish
as
long
as
we
could
see
her
then
we
returned
to
the
tent
and
aggie
and
i
crocheted
by
the
hanging
lantern
two
hours
went
by
at
eleven
tish
had
not
returned
and
hutchins
was
in
the
motor
boat
getting
it
ready
to
start
i
like
courage
miss
lizzie
she
said
to
me
but
this
thing
of
elderly
women
with
some
sort
of
bug
starting
out
at
night
in
canoes
is
too
strong
for
me
either
she
going
to
stay
in
at
night
or
i
going
home
elderly
nothing
i
said
with
some
spirit
she
is
in
the
prime
of
life
please
remember
hutchins
that
you
are
speaking
of
your
employer
miss
tish
has
no
bug
as
you
call
it
oh
she
rational
enough
hutchins
retorted
but
she
is
a
woman
of
one
idea
and
that
sort
of
person
is
dangerous
i
was
breathless
at
her
audacity
come
now
miss
lizzie
she
said
how
can
i
help
when
i
do
know
what
is
being
done
i
done
my
best
up
here
to
keep
you
comfortable
and
restrain
miss
tish
recklessness
but
i
ought
to
know
something
she
was
right
and
tish
or
no
tish
then
and
there
i
told
her
she
was
more
than
astonished
she
sat
in
the
motor
boat
with
a
lantern
at
her
feet
and
listened
i
see
she
said
slowly
so
the
so
mcdonald
is
a
spy
and
has
sent
for
dynamite
to
destroy
the
railroad
and
and
the
man
is
a
detective
how
do
you
know
he
is
a
detective
i
told
her
then
about
the
note
we
had
picked
up
from
beside
her
in
the
train
and
because
she
was
so
much
interested
she
really
seemed
quite
thrilled
i
brought
the
cipher
grocery
list
and
the
other
note
down
to
her
it
quite
convincing
is
it
she
said
and
and
exciting
i
know
when
i
been
so
excited
she
really
was
her
cheeks
were
flushed
she
looked
exceedingly
pretty
the
thing
to
do
she
said
is
to
teach
him
a
lesson
he
young
he
may
always
have
had
to
stoop
to
such
such
criminality
if
we
can
scare
him
thoroughly
it
might
do
him
a
lot
of
good
i
said
i
was
afraid
tish
took
a
more
serious
view
of
things
and
would
notify
the
authorities
and
at
that
moment
there
came
two
or
three
shots
then
silence
i
shall
never
forget
the
ride
after
tish
and
how
we
felt
when
we
failed
to
find
her
for
there
was
no
sign
of
her
the
wind
had
come
up
and
what
with
seeing
tish
tied
to
that
wretched
canoe
and
sinking
with
it
or
shot
through
the
head
and
lying
dead
in
the
bottom
of
it
we
were
about
crazy
as
we
passed
island
eleven
we
could
see
the
spy
and
his
tent
but
no
living
person
at
four
in
the
morning
we
gave
up
and
started
back
what
therefore
was
our
surprise
to
find
tish
sitting
by
the
fire
in
her
bathrobe
with
a
cup
of
tea
in
her
lap
and
her
feet
in
a
of
hot
water
considering
all
we
had
gone
through
and
that
we
had
obeyed
orders
exactly
she
was
distinctly
unjust
indeed
at
first
she
quite
refused
to
speak
to
any
of
us
i
do
think
tish
aggie
said
as
she
stood
shivering
by
the
fire
that
you
might
at
least
explain
where
you
have
been
we
have
been
going
up
and
down
the
river
for
hours
burying
you
over
and
over
tish
took
a
sip
of
tea
but
said
nothing
you
said
i
reminded
her
that
if
there
was
shooting
we
were
to
start
after
you
at
once
when
we
heard
the
shots
we
went
of
course
tish
leaned
over
and
taking
the
teakettle
from
the
fire
poured
more
water
into
the
then
at
last
she
turned
to
speak
bring
some
absorbent
cotton
and
some
bandages
hutchins
she
said
i
am
bleeding
from
a
hundred
wounds
as
for
you
she
turned
fiercely
on
aggie
and
me
the
least
you
could
have
done
was
to
be
here
when
i
returned
exhausted
injured
and
weary
but
of
course
you
were
gallivanting
round
the
lake
in
an
upholstered
motor
boat
here
she
poured
more
water
into
the
and
made
it
much
too
hot
this
thawed
her
rather
and
she
explained
what
was
wrong
she
was
bruised
scratched
to
the
knees
and
with
a
bump
the
size
of
an
egg
on
her
forehead
where
she
had
run
into
a
tree
the
whole
story
was
very
exciting
it
seems
she
got
the
green
canoe
without
any
difficulty
the
spy
being
sound
asleep
in
his
tent
but
about
that
time
the
wind
came
up
and
tish
said
she
could
not
make
an
inch
of
progress
toward
our
camp
the
chewing
gum
with
which
we
had
repaired
our
canoe
came
out
at
that
time
and
the
boat
began
to
fill
tish
being
unable
to
sit
over
the
leak
and
paddle
at
the
same
time
so
at
last
she
gave
up
and
made
for
the
mainland
the
shooting
tish
said
with
difficulty
was
by
men
from
the
indian
camp
firing
at
me
i
landed
below
the
camp
and
was
making
my
way
as
best
i
could
through
the
woods
when
they
heard
me
moving
i
believe
they
thought
it
was
a
bear
i
think
tish
was
more
afraid
of
the
indians
in
spite
of
their
steel
engravings
and
the
rest
of
it
than
she
pretended
though
she
said
she
would
have
made
herself
known
but
at
that
moment
she
fell
over
a
fallen
tree
and
for
fifteen
minutes
was
unable
to
speak
a
word
when
at
last
she
rose
the
excitement
was
over
and
they
had
gone
back
to
their
camp
anyhow
she
finished
the
green
canoe
is
hidden
a
couple
of
miles
down
the
river
and
i
guess
mcdonald
is
safe
for
a
time
lizzie
you
can
take
a
bath
safely
tish
sat
up
most
of
the
rest
of
the
night
composing
a
letter
to
the
authorities
of
the
town
telling
them
of
mcdonald
and
enclosing
careful
copies
of
the
incriminating
documents
she
had
found
during
the
following
morning
the
river
was
very
quiet
through
the
binocular
we
were
able
to
see
mcdonald
standing
on
the
shore
of
his
island
and
looking
intently
in
our
direction
but
naturally
we
paid
no
attention
to
him
the
man
went
in
swimming
that
day
and
necessitated
our
retiring
to
the
tent
for
an
hour
and
a
half
but
at
noon
naturally
soft
heart
began
to
assert
itself
spy
or
no
spy
she
said
to
tish
we
ought
to
feed
him
huh
was
tish
rejoinder
there
is
no
sense
is
wasting
good
food
on
a
man
whose
hours
are
numbered
we
were
surprised
however
to
find
that
hutchins
who
had
detested
mcdonald
was
rather
on
aggie
side
the
fact
that
he
has
but
a
few
more
hours
she
said
to
tish
is
an
excellent
reason
for
making
those
hours
as
little
wretched
as
possible
it
was
really
due
to
hutchins
therefore
that
mcdonald
had
a
luncheon
the
problem
of
how
to
get
it
to
him
was
a
troublesome
one
but
tish
solved
it
with
her
customary
sagacity
we
can
make
a
raft
she
said
a
small
one
large
enough
to
hold
a
tray
by
stopping
the
launch
some
yards
above
the
island
we
can
float
his
luncheon
to
him
quite
safely
that
was
the
method
we
ultimately
pursued
and
it
worked
most
satisfactorily
hutchins
baked
hot
biscuits
and
by
putting
a
cover
over
the
pan
we
were
enabled
to
get
them
to
him
before
they
cooled
we
prepared
a
really
appetizing
luncheon
of
hot
biscuits
broiled
ham
marmalade
and
tea
adding
at
aggie
instructions
a
jar
of
preserved
peaches
which
she
herself
had
put
up
tish
made
the
raft
while
we
prepared
the
food
and
at
exactly
twelve
we
left
the
house
mcdonald
saw
us
coming
and
was
waiting
smilingly
at
the
upper
end
of
the
island
great
scott
he
said
i
thought
you
were
never
going
to
hear
me
another
hour
and
i
have
made
a
swim
for
it
though
it
suicidal
with
this
current
i
show
you
where
you
can
come
in
so
you
wo
hit
a
rock
hutchins
had
stopped
the
engine
of
the
motor
boat
and
we
threw
out
the
anchor
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
shore
we
are
not
going
to
land
said
tish
and
i
think
you
know
perfectly
well
the
reason
why
oh
now
he
protested
surely
you
are
going
to
land
i
had
an
awfully
uncomfortable
accident
my
canoe
gone
we
know
that
tish
said
calmly
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
took
it
mcdonald
sat
down
suddenly
on
a
log
at
the
water
edge
and
looked
at
us
oh
he
said
you
may
not
believe
it
tish
said
but
we
know
everything
your
dastardly
plot
who
the
man
is
and
all
the
destruction
and
wretchedness
you
are
about
to
cause
oh
i
say
he
said
feebly
i
would
go
as
far
as
that
i
not
such
a
bad
sort
that
depends
on
the
point
of
view
said
tish
grimly
aggie
touched
her
on
the
arm
then
and
reminded
her
that
the
biscuits
were
getting
cold
but
tish
had
a
final
word
with
him
your
correspondence
has
fallen
into
my
hands
young
man
she
said
and
will
be
turned
over
to
the
proper
authorities
it
wo
tell
them
anything
they
do
know
he
said
doggedly
look
here
ladies
i
am
not
ashamed
of
this
thing
i
i
am
proud
of
it
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
yell
it
out
loud
for
everybody
to
hear
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
i
will
mcdonald
stood
up
suddenly
and
threw
his
head
back
but
here
hutchins
who
had
been
silent
spoke
for
the
first
time
do
be
an
idiot
she
said
coldly
we
have
something
here
for
you
to
eat
if
you
behave
yourself
he
seemed
to
see
her
then
for
the
first
time
for
he
favored
her
with
a
long
stare
ah
he
said
then
you
are
not
entirely
cold
and
heartless
she
made
no
reply
to
this
being
busy
in
assisting
aggie
to
lower
the
raft
over
the
side
of
the
boat
broiled
ham
tea
hot
biscuits
and
marmalade
said
aggie
gently
my
poor
fellow
we
are
doing
what
we
consider
our
duty
but
we
want
you
to
know
that
it
is
hard
for
us
very
hard
when
he
saw
our
plan
mcdonald
face
fell
but
he
stepped
out
into
the
water
up
to
his
knees
and
caught
the
raft
as
it
floated
down
before
he
said
thank
you
he
lifted
the
cover
of
the
pan
and
saw
the
hot
biscuits
underneath
really
he
said
it
very
decent
of
you
i
sent
off
a
grocery
order
yesterday
but
nothing
has
come
tish
had
got
hutchins
to
start
the
engine
by
that
time
and
we
were
moving
away
he
stood
there
up
to
his
knees
in
water
holding
the
tray
and
looking
after
us
he
was
really
a
pathetic
figure
especially
in
view
of
the
awful
fate
we
felt
was
overtaking
him
he
called
something
after
us
on
account
of
the
noise
of
the
engine
we
could
not
be
certain
but
we
all
heard
it
the
same
way
send
for
the
whole
d
d
outfit
was
the
way
it
sounded
to
us
it
wo
make
any
difference
to
me
v
the
last
thing
i
recall
of
mcdonald
that
day
is
seeing
him
standing
there
in
the
water
holding
the
tray
with
the
teapot
steaming
under
his
nose
and
gazing
after
us
with
an
air
of
bewilderment
that
did
not
deceive
us
at
all
as
i
look
back
there
is
only
one
thing
we
might
have
noticed
at
the
time
this
was
the
fact
that
hutchins
having
started
the
engine
was
sitting
beside
it
on
the
floor
of
the
boat
and
laughing
in
the
cruelest
possible
manner
as
i
said
to
aggie
at
the
time
a
spy
is
a
spy
and
entitled
to
punishment
if
discovered
but
no
young
woman
should
laugh
over
so
desperate
a
situation
i
come
now
to
the
denouement
of
this
exciting
period
it
had
been
theory
that
the
man
should
not
be
taken
into
our
confidence
if
there
was
a
reward
for
the
capture
of
the
spy
we
ourselves
intended
to
have
it
the
steamer
was
due
the
next
day
but
one
tish
was
in
favor
of
not
waiting
but
of
at
once
going
in
the
motor
boat
to
the
town
some
thirty
miles
away
and
telling
of
our
capture
but
hutchins
claimed
there
was
not
sufficient
gasoline
for
such
an
excursion
that
afternoon
we
went
in
the
motor
launch
to
where
tish
had
hidden
the
green
canoe
and
with
a
hatchet
rendered
it
useless
the
workings
of
the
subconscious
mind
are
marvelous
in
the
midst
of
chopping
tish
suddenly
looked
up
have
you
noticed
she
said
that
the
detective
is
always
watching
our
camp
that
all
he
has
to
do
aggie
suggested
stuff
and
nonsense
did
he
follow
you
into
the
swamp
does
hutchins
ever
go
out
in
the
canoe
that
he
does
go
out
also
i
tell
you
what
has
happened
she
young
and
pretty
and
he
fallen
in
love
with
her
i
must
say
it
sounded
reasonable
he
never
bothered
about
the
motor
boat
but
the
instant
she
took
the
canoe
and
started
out
he
was
hovering
somewhere
near
she
noticed
it
tish
went
on
that
what
she
was
quarreling
about
with
him
yesterday
how
are
we
to
know
said
aggie
who
was
gathering
up
the
scraps
of
the
green
canoe
and
building
a
fire
under
them
how
are
we
to
know
they
are
not
old
friends
meeting
thus
in
the
wilderness
fate
plays
strange
tricks
tish
i
lived
in
the
same
street
with
wiggins
for
years
and
never
knew
him
until
one
day
when
my
umbrella
turned
wrong
side
out
in
a
gust
of
wind
fate
fiddlesticks
said
tish
there
no
such
thing
as
fate
in
affairs
of
this
sort
it
all
instinct
the
instinct
of
the
race
to
continue
itself
this
aggie
regarded
as
indelicate
and
she
was
rather
cool
to
tish
the
balance
of
the
day
our
prisoner
spent
most
of
the
day
at
the
end
of
the
island
toward
us
sitting
quietly
as
we
could
sec
through
the
glasses
we
watched
carefully
fearing
at
any
time
to
see
the
indian
paddling
toward
him
tish
was
undecided
what
to
do
in
such
an
emergency
except
to
intercept
him
and
explain
threatening
him
also
with
having
attempted
to
carry
the
incriminating
papers
as
it
happened
however
the
entire
camp
had
gone
for
a
deer
hunt
and
before
they
returned
the
whole
thing
had
come
to
its
surprising
end
late
in
the
afternoon
tish
put
her
theory
of
the
man
to
the
test
hutchins
she
said
miss
lizzie
and
i
will
cook
the
dinner
if
you
want
to
go
in
the
canoe
to
harvey
bay
for
hutchins
at
once
said
she
did
not
care
a
rap
for
but
seeing
a
determined
glint
in
tish
eye
she
added
that
she
would
go
for
frogs
if
tish
wanted
her
out
of
the
way
do
talk
like
a
child
tish
retorted
who
said
i
wanted
you
out
of
the
way
it
is
absolutely
true
that
the
moment
hutchins
put
her
foot
into
the
canoe
the
man
put
down
his
and
rose
and
she
had
not
taken
three
strokes
with
the
paddle
before
he
was
in
the
blue
canoe
hutchins
saw
him
just
then
and
scowled
the
last
we
saw
of
her
she
was
moving
rapidly
up
the
river
and
the
detective
was
dropping
slowly
behind
they
both
disappeared
finally
into
the
bay
and
tish
drew
a
long
breath
typical
she
said
curtly
he
sent
here
to
watch
a
dangerous
man
and
spends
his
time
pursuing
the
young
woman
who
hates
the
sight
of
him
when
women
achieve
the
suffrage
they
will
put
none
but
married
men
in
positions
of
trust
hutchins
and
the
detective
were
still
out
of
sight
when
came
the
spy
supper
weighed
on
us
and
at
last
tish
attempted
to
start
the
motor
launch
we
had
placed
the
supper
and
the
small
raft
aboard
and
aggie
was
leaning
over
the
edge
untying
the
painter
not
a
man
but
a
rope
when
unexpectedly
the
engine
started
at
the
first
revolution
of
the
wheel
it
darted
out
to
the
length
of
the
rope
where
it
was
checked
abruptly
the
shock
throwing
aggie
entirely
out
and
into
the
stream
tish
caught
the
knife
from
the
supper
tray
to
cut
us
loose
and
while
tish
cut
i
pulled
aggie
in
wet
as
she
was
the
boat
was
straining
and
panting
and
on
being
released
it
sprang
forward
like
a
dog
unleashed
aggie
had
swallowed
a
great
deal
of
water
and
was
most
disagreeable
but
the
mebbe
was
going
remarkably
well
and
there
seemed
to
be
every
prospect
that
we
should
get
back
to
the
camp
in
good
order
alas
for
human
hopes
mcdonald
was
not
very
agreeable
you
know
he
said
as
he
waited
for
his
supper
to
float
within
reach
you
need
be
so
blamed
radical
about
everything
you
do
if
you
object
to
my
hanging
round
why
not
just
say
so
if
i
too
obnoxious
clear
out
obnoxious
is
hardly
the
word
said
tish
how
long
am
i
to
be
a
prisoner
i
shall
send
letters
off
by
the
first
boat
he
caught
the
raft
just
then
and
examined
the
supper
with
interest
of
course
things
might
be
worse
he
said
but
it
dirty
treatment
anyhow
and
it
darned
humiliating
somebody
i
know
is
having
a
good
time
at
my
expense
it
heartless
that
what
it
is
heartless
well
we
left
him
the
engine
starting
nicely
and
aggie
being
wrapped
in
a
tarpaulin
but
about
a
hundred
yards
above
the
island
it
began
to
slow
down
and
shortly
afterward
it
stopped
altogether
as
the
current
caught
us
we
luckily
threw
out
the
anchor
for
the
engine
refused
to
start
again
it
was
then
we
saw
the
other
canoes
the
girl
in
the
pink
was
in
the
first
one
they
glanced
at
us
curiously
as
they
passed
and
the
that
is
the
way
we
grew
to
speak
of
the
pink
raised
one
hand
in
the
air
which
is
a
form
of
canoe
greeting
probably
less
upsetting
to
the
equilibrium
than
a
vigorous
waving
of
the
arm
it
was
just
then
i
believe
that
they
saw
our
camp
and
headed
for
it
the
rest
of
what
happened
is
most
amazing
they
stopped
at
our
landing
and
unloaded
their
canoes
though
twilight
was
falling
we
could
see
them
distinctly
and
what
we
saw
was
that
they
calmly
took
possession
of
the
camp
good
gracious
tish
cried
the
girls
have
gone
into
the
tent
and
somebody
working
at
the
stove
the
impertinence
our
situation
was
acutely
painful
we
could
do
nothing
but
watch
we
called
but
our
voices
failed
to
reach
them
and
aggie
took
a
chill
partly
cold
and
partly
fury
we
sat
there
while
they
ate
the
entire
supper
they
were
having
a
very
good
time
now
and
then
somebody
would
go
into
the
tent
and
bring
something
out
and
there
would
be
shrieks
of
laughter
we
learned
afterward
that
part
of
the
amusement
was
caused
by
false
front
which
one
of
the
wretches
put
on
as
a
beard
it
was
while
thus
distracted
that
aggie
suddenly
screamed
and
a
moment
later
mcdonald
climbed
over
the
side
and
into
the
boat
dripping
do
be
alarmed
he
said
i
go
back
and
be
a
prisoner
again
just
as
soon
as
i
fired
the
engine
i
could
bear
to
think
of
the
lady
who
fell
in
sitting
here
indefinitely
and
taking
cold
he
was
examining
the
engine
while
he
spoke
have
visitors
i
see
he
observed
as
calmly
as
though
he
were
not
dripping
all
over
the
place
intruders
not
visitors
tish
said
angrily
i
never
saw
them
before
rather
pretty
the
one
with
the
pink
cap
may
i
examine
the
gasoline
supply
there
was
no
gasoline
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
afraid
no
amount
of
mechanical
genius
i
intended
to
offer
you
will
start
her
he
said
but
the
young
lady
hutchins
is
her
name
i
believe
will
see
you
here
and
come
after
you
of
course
well
there
was
no
denying
that
spy
or
no
spy
his
presence
was
a
comfort
he
offered
to
swim
back
to
the
island
and
be
a
prisoner
again
but
tish
said
magnanimously
that
there
was
no
hurry
on
aggie
offering
half
of
her
tarpaulin
against
the
wind
which
had
risen
he
accepted
your
miss
hutchins
is
reckless
is
she
he
said
when
he
was
comfortably
settled
she
a
strong
swimmer
but
a
canoe
is
uncertain
at
the
best
she
in
no
danger
said
tish
she
has
a
devoted
admirer
watching
out
for
her
the
deuce
she
has
his
voice
was
quite
interested
why
who
on
earth
your
detective
said
aggie
softly
he
quite
mad
about
her
the
way
he
follows
her
and
the
way
he
looks
at
her
it
thrilling
mcdonald
said
nothing
for
quite
a
while
the
canoe
party
had
evidently
eaten
everything
they
could
find
and
somebody
had
brought
out
a
banjo
and
was
playing
tish
unable
to
vent
her
anger
suddenly
turned
on
mcdonald
if
you
think
she
said
that
the
grocery
list
fooled
us
it
did
grocery
list
that
what
i
said
how
did
you
get
my
grocery
list
so
she
told
him
and
how
she
had
deciphered
it
and
how
the
word
dynamite
had
only
confirmed
her
early
suspicions
his
only
comment
was
to
say
good
heavens
in
a
smothered
voice
it
was
the
extractor
that
made
me
suspicious
she
finished
what
were
you
going
to
extract
teeth
and
so
when
my
indian
was
swimming
you
went
through
his
things
the
most
astounding
thing
i
ever
my
dear
lady
an
extractor
is
used
to
get
the
hooks
out
of
fish
it
was
no
cipher
i
assure
you
i
needed
an
extractor
and
i
ordered
it
the
cipher
you
speak
of
is
only
a
remarkable
coincidence
huh
said
tish
and
the
paper
you
dropped
in
the
train
was
that
a
coincidence
that
not
my
secret
he
said
and
turned
sulky
at
once
do
tell
me
tish
said
triumphantly
that
any
young
man
comes
here
absolutely
alone
without
a
purpose
i
had
a
purpose
all
right
but
it
was
not
to
blow
up
a
railroad
train
apparently
he
thought
he
had
said
too
much
for
he
relapsed
into
silence
after
that
with
an
occasional
muttering
it
was
eight
when
hutchins
canoe
came
into
sight
she
was
paddling
easily
but
the
detective
was
far
behind
and
moving
slowly
she
saw
the
camp
with
its
uninvited
guests
and
then
she
saw
us
the
detective
however
showed
no
curiosity
and
we
could
see
that
he
made
for
his
landing
and
stumbled
exhaustedly
up
the
bank
hutchins
drew
up
beside
us
he
not
try
that
again
i
think
she
said
in
her
crisp
voice
he
out
of
training
he
panted
like
a
motor
launch
who
are
our
visitors
here
her
eyes
fell
on
mcdonald
and
her
face
set
in
the
dusk
you
have
to
go
back
and
get
some
gasoline
hutchins
what
made
you
start
out
without
looking
and
send
the
vandals
away
if
they
wait
until
i
arrive
i
be
likely
to
do
them
some
harm
i
have
never
been
so
outraged
let
me
go
for
gasoline
in
the
canoe
said
mcdonald
he
leaned
over
the
thwart
and
addressed
hutchins
you
worn
out
he
said
i
promise
to
come
back
and
be
a
perfectly
prisoner
again
thanks
no
i
wet
the
exercise
will
warm
me
is
it
possible
she
said
in
a
withering
tone
that
was
lost
on
us
at
the
time
that
you
brought
no
with
you
if
we
had
had
any
doubts
they
should
have
been
settled
then
but
we
never
suspected
it
is
incredible
looking
back
the
dusk
was
falling
and
i
am
not
certain
of
what
followed
it
was
however
something
like
this
mcdonald
muttered
something
angrily
and
made
a
motion
to
get
into
the
canoe
hutchins
replied
that
she
would
not
have
help
from
him
if
she
died
for
it
the
next
thing
we
knew
she
was
in
the
launch
and
the
canoe
was
floating
off
on
the
current
aggie
squealed
and
mcdonald
instead
of
swimming
after
the
thing
merely
folded
his
arms
and
looked
at
it
you
know
he
said
to
hutchins
you
have
so
unpleasant
a
disposition
that
somebody
we
both
know
of
is
better
off
than
he
thinks
he
is
tish
fury
knew
no
bounds
for
there
we
were
marooned
and
two
of
us
wet
to
the
skin
i
must
say
for
hutchins
however
that
when
she
learned
about
aggie
she
was
bitterly
repentant
and
insisted
on
putting
her
own
sweater
on
her
but
there
we
were
and
there
we
should
likely
stay
it
was
quite
dark
by
that
time
and
we
sat
in
the
launch
rocking
gently
the
canoeing
party
had
lighted
a
large
fire
on
the
beach
using
the
driftwood
we
had
so
painfully
accumulated
we
sat
in
silence
except
that
tish
who
was
watching
our
camp
said
once
bitterly
that
she
was
glad
there
were
three
beds
in
the
tent
the
girls
of
the
canoeing
party
would
be
comfortable
after
a
time
tish
turned
on
mcdonald
sharply
since
you
claim
to
be
no
spy
she
said
perhaps
you
will
tell
us
what
brings
you
alone
to
this
place
do
tell
me
it
fish
i
seen
you
reading
with
a
line
out
you
no
fisherman
he
hesitated
no
he
admitted
i
be
frank
miss
carberry
i
did
not
come
to
fish
what
brought
you
love
he
said
in
a
low
tone
i
do
expect
you
to
believe
me
but
it
the
honest
truth
love
tish
scoffed
perhaps
i
better
tell
you
the
story
he
said
it
long
and
and
rather
sad
love
stories
hutchins
put
in
coldly
are
terribly
stupid
except
to
those
concerned
that
he
retorted
is
because
you
have
never
been
in
love
you
are
young
and
you
will
pardon
the
liberty
attractive
but
you
are
totally
prosaic
and
unromantic
indeed
she
said
and
relapsed
into
silence
these
other
ladies
mcdonald
went
on
will
understand
the
strangeness
of
my
situation
when
i
explain
that
the
the
young
lady
i
care
for
is
very
near
is
in
fact
within
sight
good
gracious
said
aggie
where
it
is
a
long
story
but
it
may
help
to
while
away
the
long
night
hours
for
i
dare
say
we
are
here
for
the
night
did
any
one
happen
to
notice
the
young
lady
in
the
first
canoe
in
the
pink
we
said
we
had
all
except
hutchins
who
of
course
had
not
seen
her
mcdonald
got
a
wet
cigarette
from
his
pocket
and
finding
a
box
of
matches
on
the
seat
made
an
attempt
to
dry
it
over
the
flames
so
his
story
was
told
in
the
flickering
light
of
one
match
after
another
vi
i
am
mcdonald
said
as
the
cigarette
steamed
the
son
of
poor
but
honest
parents
all
my
life
i
have
been
obliged
to
labor
you
may
say
that
my
english
is
surprisingly
pure
under
such
conditions
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
educated
myself
at
night
using
a
lantern
in
the
top
of
my
father
stable
i
thought
you
said
he
was
poor
hutchins
put
in
nastily
how
did
he
have
a
stable
he
kept
a
livery
stable
any
points
that
are
not
clear
i
will
explain
afterward
once
the
thread
of
a
narrative
is
broken
it
is
difficult
to
resume
miss
hutchins
near
us
in
a
large
house
lived
the
lady
of
my
heart
the
pink
girl
said
aggie
i
begin
to
understand
but
he
added
near
us
also
lived
a
boy
she
liked
him
very
much
and
even
in
the
days
i
was
fiercely
jealous
of
him
it
may
surprise
you
to
know
that
in
those
days
i
longed
fairly
longed
for
red
hair
and
a
red
mustache
i
hate
to
interrupt
said
hutchins
but
did
he
have
a
mustache
as
a
boy
he
ignored
her
we
three
grew
up
together
the
girl
is
beautiful
you
probably
noticed
that
and
amiable
the
one
thing
i
admire
in
a
young
woman
is
amiability
it
would
not
for
instance
have
occurred
to
her
to
isolate
an
entire
party
on
the
bosom
of
a
northern
and
treacherous
river
out
of
pure
temper
to
think
said
aggie
softly
that
she
is
just
over
there
by
the
do
you
suppose
if
she
loves
you
she
senses
your
nearness
that
it
exactly
he
replied
in
a
gloomy
voice
if
she
loves
me
but
does
she
in
other
words
has
she
come
up
the
river
to
meet
me
or
to
meet
my
rival
she
knows
we
are
here
both
of
us
have
written
her
the
presence
of
one
or
the
other
of
us
is
the
real
reason
for
this
excursion
of
hers
but
again
the
question
is
which
here
the
match
he
was
holding
under
the
cigarette
burned
his
fingers
and
he
flung
it
overboard
with
a
violent
gesture
the
detective
of
course
said
tish
i
knew
it
from
the
beginning
of
your
story
the
detective
he
assented
you
see
his
very
profession
attracts
there
an
element
of
romance
in
it
i
myself
have
kept
on
with
my
father
and
now
run
the
er
livery
stable
my
business
is
a
handicap
from
a
romantic
point
of
view
i
am
aware
mcdonald
went
on
that
it
is
not
customary
to
speak
so
frankly
of
affairs
of
this
sort
but
i
have
two
reasons
it
hurts
me
to
rest
under
unjust
suspicion
i
am
no
spy
ladies
and
the
second
reason
is
even
stronger
consider
my
desperate
position
in
the
morning
my
rival
will
see
her
he
will
paddle
his
canoe
to
the
great
rock
below
your
camp
and
sing
his
love
song
from
the
water
in
the
morning
i
shall
sit
here
helpless
ill
possibly
and
see
all
that
i
value
in
life
slip
out
of
my
grasp
and
all
through
no
fault
of
my
own
things
are
so
evenly
balanced
so
little
will
shift
the
weight
of
her
favor
that
frankly
the
first
one
to
reach
her
will
get
her
i
confess
i
was
thrilled
and
even
tish
was
touched
but
she
covered
her
emotion
with
hard
common
sense
what
her
name
she
demanded
considering
my
frankness
i
must
withhold
that
why
not
simply
refer
to
her
as
the
pink
or
better
still
and
more
briefly
the
that
may
stand
for
pink
or
the
person
that
smiles
she
smiles
a
great
deal
or
or
almost
anything
it
also
stands
said
hutchins
with
a
sniff
for
pretty
tall
story
tish
considered
her
skepticism
unworthy
in
one
so
young
and
told
her
so
on
which
she
relapsed
into
a
sulky
silence
in
view
of
what
we
knew
the
bonfire
at
our
camp
and
the
small
figure
across
the
river
took
on
a
new
significance
as
aggie
said
to
think
of
the
man
sleeping
calmly
while
his
lady
love
was
so
near
and
his
rival
so
to
speak
de
combat
shortly
after
finishing
his
story
mcdonald
went
to
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
lifted
the
anchor
rope
it
is
possible
he
said
that
the
current
will
carry
us
to
my
island
with
a
little
judicious
management
even
though
we
miss
it
we
hardly
be
worse
off
than
we
are
it
was
surprising
we
had
not
thought
of
it
before
for
the
plan
succeeded
admirably
by
moving
a
few
feet
at
a
time
and
then
anchoring
we
made
slow
but
safe
progress
and
at
last
touched
shore
we
got
out
and
mcdonald
built
a
large
fire
near
which
we
put
aggie
to
steam
his
supper
which
he
had
not
had
time
to
eat
he
generously
divided
and
we
heated
the
tea
hutchins
however
refused
to
eat
warmth
and
food
restored
tish
mind
to
its
usual
keenness
i
recall
now
the
admiration
in
mcdonald
eyes
when
she
suddenly
put
down
the
sandwich
she
was
eating
and
exclaimed
the
flags
of
course
he
told
her
to
watch
for
a
red
flag
as
she
came
up
the
river
so
when
the
party
saw
ours
they
landed
perhaps
they
still
think
it
is
his
camp
and
that
he
is
away
overnight
that
it
exactly
he
said
think
of
the
poor
wretch
excitement
when
he
saw
your
flag
still
on
looking
back
it
seems
curious
that
we
overlooked
the
way
the
man
had
followed
hutchins
about
true
men
are
polygamous
animals
tish
says
and
are
quite
capable
of
following
one
woman
about
while
they
are
sincerely
in
love
with
somebody
else
but
when
you
think
of
it
the
detective
had
apparently
followed
hutchins
from
the
start
and
had
gone
into
the
wilderness
to
be
near
her
with
only
a
suitcase
and
a
mackintosh
coat
which
looked
like
a
mad
infatuation
tish
says
she
thought
of
this
at
the
time
and
that
from
what
she
had
seen
of
the
hutchins
was
much
prettier
but
she
says
she
decided
that
men
often
love
one
quality
in
one
girl
and
another
in
another
that
he
probably
loved
hutchins
beauty
and
the
amiability
of
the
also
she
says
she
reflected
that
the
polygamy
of
the
far
east
is
probably
due
to
this
tendency
in
the
male
more
than
to
a
preponderance
of
women
tish
called
me
aside
while
mcdonald
was
gathering
firewood
i
a
fool
and
a
guilty
woman
lizzie
she
said
because
of
an
unjust
suspicion
i
have
possibly
wrecked
this
poor
boy
life
i
tried
to
soothe
her
they
might
have
been
wretchedly
unhappy
together
tish
i
said
and
anyhow
i
doubt
whether
he
is
able
to
support
a
wife
there
nothing
much
in
keeping
a
livery
stable
nowadays
there
only
one
thing
that
still
puzzles
me
tish
observed
granting
that
the
grocery
order
was
a
grocery
order
what
about
the
note
we
might
have
followed
this
line
of
thought
and
saved
what
occurred
later
but
that
a
new
idea
suddenly
struck
tish
she
is
curious
in
that
way
her
mind
works
very
rapidly
at
times
and
because
i
can
not
take
her
mental
hurdles
so
to
speak
she
is
often
impatient
lizzie
she
said
suddenly
did
you
notice
that
when
the
anchor
was
lifted
we
drifted
directly
to
this
island
do
stare
at
me
like
that
use
your
wits
when
i
failed
instantly
to
understand
however
she
turned
abruptly
and
left
me
disappearing
in
the
shadows
for
the
next
hour
nothing
happened
tish
was
not
in
sight
and
aggie
slept
by
the
fire
hutchins
sat
with
her
chin
cupped
in
her
hands
and
mcdonald
gathered
driftwood
hutchins
only
spoke
once
i
awfully
sorry
about
the
canoe
miss
lizzie
she
said
it
was
silly
and
and
selfish
i
do
always
act
like
a
bad
child
the
truth
is
i
rather
upset
and
nervous
i
hate
to
be
thwarted
i
sorry
i
ca
explain
any
further
i
was
magnanimous
i
sure
until
you
been
perfectly
satisfactory
i
said
but
it
seems
extraordinary
that
you
should
dislike
men
the
way
you
do
she
only
eyed
me
searchingly
it
is
my
evening
custom
to
prepare
for
the
night
by
taking
my
switch
off
and
combing
and
braiding
my
hair
so
as
we
seemed
to
be
settled
for
the
night
i
asked
mcdonald
whether
the
camp
afforded
an
extra
comb
he
brought
out
a
at
once
from
the
tent
and
opened
it
here
a
comb
he
said
i
never
use
one
i
sorry
this
is
all
i
can
supply
my
eyes
were
glued
to
the
case
it
was
an
english
with
fittings
he
saw
me
staring
at
it
and
changed
color
nice
bag
is
it
he
said
it
was
a
gift
of
course
the
the
livery
stable
does
run
much
to
this
sort
of
thing
but
the
fine
edge
of
suspicion
had
crept
into
my
mind
again
tish
did
not
return
to
the
fire
for
some
time
before
she
came
back
we
were
all
thoroughly
alarmed
the
island
was
small
and
a
short
search
convinced
us
that
she
was
not
on
it
we
wakened
aggie
and
told
her
and
the
situation
was
very
painful
the
launch
was
where
we
had
left
it
mcdonald
looked
more
and
more
uneasy
my
sane
mind
tells
me
she
perfectly
safe
he
said
i
do
know
that
i
ever
met
a
person
more
able
to
take
care
of
herself
but
darned
odd
that
all
i
can
say
just
as
he
spoke
a
volley
of
shots
sounded
from
up
the
river
near
our
camp
two
close
together
and
then
one
and
somebody
screamed
it
was
very
dark
we
could
see
lanterns
flashing
at
our
camp
and
somebody
was
yelling
hoarsely
one
lantern
seemed
to
run
up
and
down
the
beach
in
mad
excitement
and
then
out
of
the
din
aggie
whose
ears
are
sharp
suddenly
heard
the
splash
of
a
canoe
paddle
i
shall
tell
tish
story
of
what
happened
as
she
told
it
to
charlie
sands
two
weeks
or
so
later
it
is
perfectly
simple
she
said
and
it
stupid
to
make
such
a
fuss
over
it
do
talk
to
me
about
breaking
the
law
the
girl
came
i
did
steal
her
charlie
sands
i
remember
interrupted
at
that
moment
to
remind
her
that
she
had
shot
a
hole
in
the
detective
canoe
but
this
only
irritated
her
certainly
i
did
she
snapped
but
it
perfectly
idiotic
of
him
to
say
that
it
took
off
the
heel
of
his
shoe
in
that
stony
country
always
easy
to
lose
a
heel
but
to
return
to
tish
story
it
occurred
to
me
she
said
that
if
the
launch
had
drifted
to
mcdonald
island
the
canoe
might
have
done
so
too
so
i
took
a
look
round
i
been
pretty
much
worried
about
having
called
the
boy
a
spy
when
he
was
and
it
worried
me
to
think
that
he
could
get
away
from
the
place
i
never
liked
the
man
he
was
cruel
to
aggie
cat
but
we
told
you
that
i
knew
that
in
the
morning
the
detective
would
see
the
as
we
called
her
and
he
could
get
over
and
propose
before
breakfast
but
when
i
found
the
canoe
yes
i
found
it
i
did
intend
to
do
anything
more
than
steal
the
detective
boat
is
that
all
said
charlie
sands
sarcastically
you
disappoint
me
aunt
letitia
with
all
the
chances
you
had
to
burn
his
pitiful
little
tent
for
instance
or
steal
his
suitcase
but
on
my
way
tish
went
on
with
simple
dignity
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
could
move
things
a
step
farther
by
taking
the
girl
to
mcdonald
and
letting
him
have
his
chance
right
away
things
went
well
from
the
start
for
she
was
standing
alone
looking
out
over
the
river
it
was
dark
except
for
the
starlight
and
i
did
know
it
was
she
i
beached
the
canoe
and
she
squealed
a
little
when
i
spoke
to
her
just
what
broke
in
charlie
sands
does
one
say
under
such
circumstances
sometime
i
may
wish
to
abduct
a
young
woman
and
it
is
well
to
be
prepared
i
told
her
the
young
man
she
had
expected
was
on
island
eleven
and
had
sent
me
to
get
her
she
was
awfully
excited
she
said
they
seen
his
signal
but
nothing
of
him
and
when
they
found
a
number
of
feminine
things
round
they
all
felt
a
little
well
you
can
understand
she
went
back
to
get
a
coat
and
while
she
was
gone
i
untied
the
canoes
and
pushed
them
out
into
the
river
i
thorough
and
i
was
going
to
have
a
lot
of
people
interfering
before
we
got
things
fixed
it
was
here
i
think
that
charlie
sands
gave
a
low
moan
and
collapsed
on
the
sofa
certainly
he
said
in
a
stifled
voice
i
believe
in
being
thorough
and
of
course
a
few
canoes
more
or
less
do
not
matter
later
tish
said
i
knew
i
been
thoughtless
about
the
canoes
but
of
course
it
was
too
late
then
and
when
was
it
that
you
assaulted
the
detective
he
fired
first
said
tish
i
never
felt
more
peaceable
in
my
life
it
absurd
for
him
to
say
that
he
was
watching
our
camp
as
he
had
every
night
we
been
there
who
asked
him
to
guard
us
and
the
idea
of
his
saying
he
thought
we
were
indians
stealing
things
and
that
he
fired
into
the
air
the
bullets
sang
past
me
i
had
hardly
time
to
get
my
revolver
out
of
my
stocking
and
then
asked
charlie
sands
and
then
said
tish
we
went
calmly
down
the
river
to
island
eleven
we
went
rapidly
for
at
first
the
detective
did
not
know
i
had
shot
a
hole
in
his
canoe
and
he
followed
us
it
stands
to
reason
that
if
shot
his
heel
off
he
have
known
there
was
a
hole
in
the
boat
luckily
the
girl
was
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
when
she
fainted
or
we
might
have
been
upset
it
was
at
this
point
i
believe
that
charlie
sands
got
his
hat
and
opened
the
door
i
find
he
said
that
i
can
not
stand
any
more
at
present
aunt
tish
i
shall
return
when
i
am
stronger
so
i
shall
go
back
to
my
own
narrative
really
my
justification
is
almost
complete
any
one
reading
to
this
point
will
realize
the
injustice
of
the
things
that
have
been
said
about
us
we
were
despairing
of
tish
as
i
have
said
when
we
heard
the
shots
and
then
the
approach
of
a
canoe
then
tish
hailed
us
quick
somebody
she
said
i
have
a
cramp
in
my
right
leg
the
canoeing
position
kneeling
as
one
must
had
been
always
very
trying
for
her
she
frequently
developed
cramps
which
only
a
hot
footbath
relieved
mcdonald
waded
out
into
the
water
our
beach
fire
illuminated
the
whole
scene
distinctly
and
when
he
saw
the
huddled
in
the
canoe
he
stopped
as
though
he
had
been
shot
how
interesting
said
hutchins
from
the
bank
in
her
cool
voice
i
remember
yet
tish
stamping
round
on
her
cramped
limb
and
smiling
benevolently
at
all
of
us
the
girl
however
looked
startled
and
unhappy
and
a
little
dizzy
hutchins
helped
her
to
a
fallen
tree
where
where
is
he
said
the
tish
stared
at
her
bless
the
girl
she
said
did
you
think
i
meant
the
other
one
i
what
other
one
tish
put
her
hand
on
mcdonald
arm
my
dear
girl
she
said
this
young
man
adores
you
he
all
that
a
girl
ought
to
want
in
the
man
she
loves
i
have
done
him
a
grave
injustice
and
he
has
borne
it
nobly
come
now
let
me
put
your
hand
in
his
and
say
you
will
marry
him
marry
him
said
the
why
i
never
saw
him
in
my
life
before
we
had
been
so
occupied
with
this
astounding
scene
that
none
of
us
had
noticed
the
arrival
of
the
detective
he
limped
rapidly
up
the
bank
having
lost
his
heel
as
i
have
explained
and
dripping
with
water
confronted
us
when
a
person
is
pale
he
is
very
pale
and
his
teeth
showed
he
ignored
all
of
us
but
the
who
turned
and
saw
him
and
went
straight
into
his
arms
in
the
most
unmaidenly
fashion
by
heaven
he
said
i
thought
that
elderly
lunatic
had
taken
you
off
and
killed
you
he
kissed
her
quite
frantically
before
all
of
us
and
then
with
one
arm
round
her
he
confronted
tish
i
through
he
said
i
done
there
is
a
salary
in
the
world
that
will
make
me
stay
within
gunshot
of
you
another
day
he
eyed
her
fiercely
you
are
a
dangerous
woman
madam
he
said
i
going
to
bring
a
charge
against
you
for
abduction
and
assault
with
intent
to
kill
and
if
there
any
proof
needed
i
show
my
canoe
full
of
water
to
the
gunwale
here
he
kissed
the
girl
again
you
you
know
her
gasped
mcdonald
and
dropped
on
a
as
though
he
were
too
weak
to
stand
it
looks
like
it
does
it
here
i
happened
to
glance
at
hutchins
and
she
was
convulsed
with
mirth
tish
saw
her
too
and
glared
at
her
but
she
seemed
to
get
worse
then
without
the
slightest
warning
she
walked
round
the
and
kissed
mcdonald
solemnly
on
the
top
of
his
head
i
give
it
up
she
said
somebody
will
have
to
marry
you
and
take
care
of
you
i
better
be
the
person
but
why
was
the
detective
watching
hutchins
said
charlie
sands
was
it
because
he
had
heard
of
my
aunt
letitia
reckless
nature
i
am
still
bewildered
you
remember
the
night
we
got
the
worms
i
see
the
detective
was
watching
all
of
you
because
you
stole
the
worms
stole
nothing
tish
snapped
that
the
girl
house
she
the
miss
newcomb
you
read
about
in
the
papers
now
do
you
understand
certainly
i
do
she
was
a
fugitive
from
justice
because
the
cat
found
dynamite
in
the
woods
or
perhaps
i
a
trifle
confused
but
now
i
have
it
she
had
stolen
a
and
given
it
to
mcdonald
lucky
chap
i
was
crazy
about
hutchins
myself
you
might
tip
her
the
word
that
i
badly
off
for
a
myself
but
what
about
the
how
did
she
happen
on
the
scene
she
was
engaged
to
the
detective
and
she
was
camping
down
the
river
he
had
sent
her
word
where
he
was
the
red
flag
was
to
help
her
find
him
tish
knows
charlie
sands
so
she
let
him
talk
then
mcdonald
was
too
wealthy
charlie
she
said
so
when
she
wanted
him
to
work
and
be
useful
and
he
refused
she
ran
off
and
got
a
situation
herself
to
teach
him
a
lesson
she
could
drive
a
car
but
her
people
heard
about
it
and
that
wretched
detective
was
responsible
for
her
safety
that
why
he
followed
her
about
i
should
like
to
follow
her
about
myself
said
charlie
sands
do
you
think
she
unalterably
decided
to
take
mcdonald
money
and
all
still
an
idler
lend
me
your
car
aunt
tish
there
a
theory
there
and
who
knows
he
is
going
to
work
for
six
months
before
she
marries
him
tish
said
he
seems
to
like
to
work
now
he
has
started
she
rang
the
bell
and
hannah
came
to
the
door
hannah
said
tish
calmly
call
up
the
garage
and
tell
mcdonald
to
bring
the
car
round
sands
is
going
out
my
country
tish
of
thee
we
had
meant
to
go
to
europe
this
last
summer
and
tish
would
have
gone
anyhow
war
or
no
war
if
we
had
not
switched
her
off
onto
something
else
submarines
fiddlesticks
she
said
give
me
a
good
life
preserver
with
a
bottle
of
blackberry
cordial
fastened
to
it
and
the
sea
has
no
terrors
for
me
she
said
the
proper
way
to
do
in
case
the
ship
was
torpedoed
was
to
go
up
on
an
upper
deck
and
let
the
vessel
sink
under
one
then
without
haste
she
explained
as
the
water
rises
about
one
strike
out
calmly
the
supports
one
but
swim
gently
for
the
exercise
it
will
prevent
chilling
with
a
waterproof
bag
of
crackers
and
mild
weather
one
could
go
on
comfortably
for
a
day
or
two
i
still
remember
the
despairing
face
aggie
turned
to
me
it
was
december
then
and
very
cold
however
she
said
nothing
more
until
january
early
in
that
month
charlie
sands
came
to
tish
to
sunday
dinner
and
we
were
all
there
the
subject
came
up
then
it
was
about
the
time
tish
took
up
vegetarianism
i
remember
that
because
the
only
way
she
could
induce
charlie
sands
to
come
to
dinner
was
to
promise
to
have
two
chops
for
him
personally
i
am
not
a
vegetarian
i
am
not
and
never
will
be
i
took
a
firm
stand
except
when
at
tish
home
but
aggie
followed
tish
lead
of
course
and
i
believe
lived
up
to
it
as
far
as
possible
although
it
is
quite
true
that
stopping
in
one
day
unexpectedly
to
secure
a
new
crochet
pattern
i
smelled
broiling
steak
but
aggie
explained
that
she
merely
intended
to
use
the
juice
from
a
small
portion
having
had
one
of
her
weak
spells
the
balance
to
go
to
the
janitor
dog
however
this
is
a
digression
europe
said
charlie
sands
forget
it
what
in
the
name
of
the
gastric
juice
is
this
i
eating
it
was
a
mixture
of
bran
raisins
and
chopped
nuts
as
i
recall
it
moistened
with
water
and
pressed
into
a
compact
form
it
was
tish
own
invention
she
called
it
and
was
talking
of
making
it
in
large
quantities
for
sale
charlie
sands
gave
it
up
with
a
feeble
gesture
i
sorry
aunt
letitia
he
said
at
last
i
a
strong
man
ordinarily
but
by
the
time
i
got
it
masticated
i
too
weak
to
swallow
it
if
if
one
could
have
a
stream
of
water
playing
on
it
while
working
it
would
facilitate
things
the
ostermaiers
said
aggie
are
going
west
good
for
the
ostermaiers
said
charlie
sands
great
idea
see
america
first
country
tish
of
thee
etc
why
do
you
three
try
it
tish
relinquished
europe
slowly
one
would
think
charlie
sands
said
that
you
were
a
german
being
asked
to
give
up
belgium
what
part
of
the
west
she
demanded
it
all
civilized
is
it
the
rocky
mountains
said
charlie
sands
will
never
be
civilized
tish
broke
off
a
piece
of
and
when
she
thought
no
one
was
looking
poured
a
little
tea
over
it
there
was
a
gleam
in
her
eye
that
aggie
and
i
have
learned
to
know
mountains
she
said
that
ought
to
be
good
for
aggie
hay
fever
i
rather
live
with
hay
fever
aggie
put
in
sharply
than
cure
it
by
falling
over
a
precipice
you
have
to
take
a
chance
on
that
of
course
charlie
sands
said
i
not
sure
it
will
be
safe
but
i
am
sure
it
will
be
interesting
oh
he
knew
tish
well
enough
tell
her
a
thing
was
dangerous
and
no
power
could
restrain
her
i
do
not
mind
saying
that
i
was
not
keen
about
the
thing
i
had
my
fortune
told
years
ago
and
the
palmist
said
that
if
a
certain
line
had
had
a
bend
in
it
i
should
have
been
hanged
but
since
it
did
not
to
be
careful
of
high
places
it
a
sporting
chance
said
charlie
sands
although
i
was
prodding
him
under
the
table
with
some
good
horses
and
a
bag
of
this
er
concentrated
food
you
would
have
the
time
of
your
young
lives
this
was
figurative
we
are
all
of
us
round
fifty
the
the
he
said
would
serve
for
both
food
and
ammunition
i
can
see
you
riding
along
now
and
then
dropping
a
piece
of
it
on
the
head
of
some
unlucky
mountain
goat
and
watching
it
topple
over
into
eternity
i
can
see
riding
said
aggie
then
i
not
going
i
have
never
been
on
a
horse
and
i
never
intend
to
be
do
be
a
fool
tish
snapped
if
you
never
been
on
a
horse
time
and
to
spare
you
got
on
one
hannah
had
been
clearing
the
table
with
her
lips
shut
tight
hannah
is
an
old
and
privileged
servant
and
has
a
most
unfortunate
habit
of
speaking
her
mind
so
now
she
stopped
beside
tish
you
take
my
advice
and
go
miss
tish
she
said
if
you
ride
a
horse
round
some
and
get
an
appetite
you
go
down
on
your
knees
and
apologize
to
your
maker
for
the
stuff
we
been
eating
the
last
four
weeks
she
turned
to
charlie
sands
and
positively
her
chin
was
quivering
i
a
healthy
woman
she
said
and
i
work
hard
and
need
good
nourishing
food
when
it
come
to
a
point
where
i
eat
the
meat
and
let
it
go
hungry
she
said
it
time
either
i
lost
my
appetite
or
miss
tish
went
away
well
tish
dismissed
hannah
haughtily
from
the
room
and
the
conversation
went
on
none
of
us
had
been
far
west
although
tish
has
a
in
toledo
ohio
but
owing
to
a
quarrel
over
a
pair
of
andirons
that
had
been
in
the
family
for
a
time
she
had
never
visited
her
you
like
it
all
of
you
charlie
sands
said
as
we
waited
for
the
baked
apples
once
get
started
with
a
good
horse
between
your
knees
and
i
hope
tish
interrupted
him
that
you
do
not
think
we
are
going
to
ride
astride
i
darned
sure
of
it
that
was
charlie
sands
way
of
talking
he
does
not
mean
to
be
rude
and
he
is
really
a
young
man
of
splendid
character
but
as
tish
says
contact
with
the
world
although
it
has
not
spoiled
him
has
roughened
his
speech
you
see
he
explained
there
are
places
out
there
where
the
horses
have
to
climb
like
goats
it
only
fair
to
them
to
distribute
your
weight
equally
a
side
saddle
is
likely
to
turn
and
drop
you
a
mile
or
two
down
a
crack
aggie
went
rather
white
and
sneezed
violently
but
tish
looked
thoughtful
it
sounds
reasonable
she
said
i
felt
for
along
time
that
i
be
glad
to
discard
skirts
skirts
she
said
are
badge
of
servitude
survivals
of
the
harem
reminders
of
a
time
when
nothing
was
expected
of
women
but
parasitic
leisure
i
tried
to
tell
her
that
she
was
wrong
about
the
skirts
miss
macgillicuddy
our
missionary
in
india
had
certainly
said
that
the
women
in
harems
wore
bloomers
but
tish
left
the
room
abruptly
returning
shortly
after
with
a
volume
of
the
encyclopædia
and
looked
up
the
rocky
mountains
i
remember
it
said
that
the
highest
ranges
were
as
compared
with
the
size
and
shape
of
the
earth
only
as
the
corrugations
on
the
skin
of
an
orange
either
the
man
who
wrote
that
had
never
seen
an
orange
or
he
had
never
seen
the
rocky
mountains
orange
indeed
if
he
had
said
the
upper
end
of
a
pineapple
it
would
have
been
more
like
it
i
wish
the
man
who
wrote
it
would
go
to
glacier
park
i
am
not
a
vindictive
woman
but
i
know
one
or
two
places
where
i
would
like
to
place
him
and
make
him
swallow
that
orange
i
like
to
see
him
on
a
horse
on
the
brink
of
a
cañon
a
mile
deep
and
have
his
horse
reach
over
the
edge
for
a
stray
plant
or
two
or
standing
in
a
cloud
up
to
his
waist
so
that
as
aggie
so
plaintively
observed
the
lower
half
of
one
is
in
a
snowstorm
while
the
upper
part
is
getting
sunburned
for
we
went
oh
yes
we
went
it
is
not
the
encyclopædia
fault
that
we
came
back
but
now
that
we
are
home
and
nothing
wrong
except
a
touch
of
lumbago
that
tish
got
from
sleeping
on
the
ground
and
of
course
aggie
unfortunate
experience
with
her
teeth
i
look
back
on
our
various
adventures
with
pleasure
i
even
contemplate
a
return
next
year
although
aggie
says
she
will
die
first
but
even
that
is
not
to
be
taken
as
final
the
last
time
i
went
to
see
her
she
had
bought
a
revolver
from
the
janitor
and
was
taking
lessons
in
loading
it
the
ostermaiers
went
also
not
with
us
however
the
congregation
made
up
a
purse
for
the
purpose
and
tish
and
aggie
and
i
went
further
and
purchased
a
for
ostermaier
and
a
quantity
of
cigars
smoking
is
the
good
man
only
weakness
i
must
say
however
that
it
is
absurd
to
hear
ostermaier
boasting
of
the
trip
to
hear
her
talk
one
would
think
they
had
done
the
whole
thing
instead
of
sitting
in
an
automobile
and
looking
up
at
the
mountains
i
shall
never
forget
the
day
they
were
in
a
car
passing
along
a
road
and
we
crossed
unexpectedly
ahead
of
them
and
went
on
straight
up
the
side
of
a
mountain
tish
had
a
sombrero
on
the
side
of
her
head
and
was
resting
herself
in
the
saddle
by
having
her
right
leg
thrown
negligently
over
the
neck
with
the
left
foot
she
was
kicking
our
a
creature
so
scarred
with
brands
that
tish
had
named
her
jane
after
a
cousin
of
hers
who
had
had
so
many
operations
that
tish
says
she
is
now
entirely
unfurnished
ostermaier
face
was
terrible
and
only
two
days
ago
ostermaier
came
over
to
ask
about
putting
an
extra
width
in
the
skirt
to
her
last
winter
suit
but
it
is
my
belief
that
she
came
to
save
soul
and
nothing
else
i
so
glad
wide
skirts
have
come
in
she
said
they
so
modest
are
they
miss
tish
not
in
a
wind
tish
said
eying
her
coldly
i
do
think
dear
miss
tish
she
went
on
with
her
eyes
down
that
to
to
go
about
in
before
a
young
man
is
well
it
is
hardly
discreet
is
it
i
saw
tish
glancing
about
the
room
she
was
pretty
angry
and
i
knew
perfectly
well
what
she
wanted
i
put
my
over
charlie
sands
tish
had
learned
to
roll
cigarettes
out
in
glacier
park
not
that
she
smoked
them
of
course
but
she
said
she
might
as
well
know
how
there
was
no
knowing
when
it
would
come
in
handy
and
when
she
wishes
to
calm
herself
she
reaches
instinctively
for
what
bill
used
to
call
strangely
the
makings
if
she
said
her
eye
still
roving
if
it
was
any
treat
to
a
cowpuncher
to
see
three
elderly
women
in
ostermaier
and
it
kind
of
you
to
think
so
why
i
not
selfish
ostermaier
face
was
terrible
she
gathered
up
her
skirt
and
rose
i
shall
not
tell
ostermaier
what
you
have
just
said
she
observed
with
her
mouth
set
hard
we
owe
you
a
great
deal
especially
the
return
of
my
earrings
but
i
must
request
miss
tish
that
you
do
not
voice
such
sentiments
in
the
sunday
school
tish
watched
her
out
then
she
sat
down
and
rolled
eleven
cigarettes
for
charlie
sands
one
after
the
other
at
last
she
spoke
i
not
sure
she
said
tartly
that
if
i
had
it
to
do
over
again
do
it
that
woman
not
a
christian
i
was
thinking
she
went
on
of
giving
them
a
part
of
the
reward
to
go
to
asbury
park
with
but
have
to
wear
blinders
on
the
so
i
not
do
it
however
i
am
ahead
of
my
recital
for
a
few
days
tish
said
nothing
more
but
one
sunday
morning
walking
home
from
church
she
turned
to
me
suddenly
and
said
lizzie
you
fat
i
as
the
lord
made
me
i
replied
with
some
spirit
fiddlesticks
said
tish
you
as
your
own
sloth
and
overindulgence
has
made
you
do
blame
the
good
man
for
it
now
i
am
a
peaceful
woman
and
tish
is
as
my
own
sister
and
indeed
even
more
so
but
i
was
roused
to
anger
by
her
speech
i
been
fleshy
all
my
life
i
said
i
no
lazier
than
most
and
i
a
dratted
sight
more
agreeable
than
some
i
know
on
account
of
having
the
ends
of
my
nerves
padded
but
she
switched
to
another
subject
in
her
characteristic
manner
have
you
ever
reflected
either
of
you
she
observed
that
we
know
nothing
of
this
great
land
of
ours
that
we
sing
of
loving
rocks
and
rills
thy
woods
and
templed
hills
although
the
word
savors
of
paganism
and
does
not
belong
in
a
national
hymn
and
that
it
is
all
balderdash
aggie
took
exception
to
this
and
said
that
she
loved
her
native
land
and
had
been
south
to
pinehurst
and
west
to
see
her
niece
in
minneapolis
on
account
of
the
baby
having
been
named
for
her
but
tish
merely
listened
with
a
grim
smile
travel
from
a
car
window
she
observed
is
no
better
than
travel
in
a
nickelodeon
i
have
done
all
of
that
i
am
going
to
i
intend
to
become
acquainted
with
my
native
land
closely
acquainted
state
by
state
i
shall
wander
over
it
refreshing
soul
and
body
and
using
muscles
too
long
unused
tish
aggie
quavered
you
are
not
going
on
another
only
a
year
or
two
before
tish
had
read
stevenson
travels
with
a
donkey
and
had
been
possessed
to
follow
his
example
i
have
elsewhere
recorded
the
details
of
that
terrible
trip
even
i
turned
pale
i
fear
and
cast
a
nervous
eye
toward
the
table
where
tish
keeps
her
tish
is
imaginative
and
is
always
influenced
by
the
latest
book
she
has
read
for
instance
a
volume
on
nursing
at
the
front
almost
sent
her
across
to
france
although
she
can
not
make
a
bed
and
never
could
and
turns
pale
at
the
sight
of
blood
and
another
time
a
book
on
flying
machines
sent
her
up
into
the
air
mentally
if
not
literally
i
shall
never
forget
the
time
she
secured
some
literature
on
the
mormon
church
and
the
difficulty
i
had
in
smuggling
it
out
under
my
coat
tish
did
not
refute
the
at
once
but
fell
into
a
deep
reverie
it
is
not
her
custom
to
confide
her
plans
to
us
until
they
are
fully
shaped
and
too
far
on
to
be
interfered
with
which
accounts
for
our
nervousness
on
arriving
at
her
apartment
however
we
found
a
map
laid
out
on
the
table
and
the
rocky
mountains
marked
with
pins
we
noticed
that
whenever
she
straightened
from
the
table
she
grunted
what
we
want
tish
said
is
isolation
no
people
no
crowds
no
servants
if
i
do
get
away
from
hannah
soon
i
murder
her
it
would
hurt
to
see
somebody
now
and
then
tish
aggie
objected
nobody
tish
said
firmly
a
good
horse
is
companion
enough
she
forgot
herself
and
straightened
completely
and
she
groaned
we
might
meet
some
desirable
people
tish
i
put
in
firmly
if
we
do
i
do
intend
to
run
like
a
rabbit
desirable
people
tish
scoffed
in
the
rocky
mountains
my
dear
lizzie
every
desperado
in
the
country
takes
refuge
in
the
rockies
of
course
if
you
want
to
take
up
with
that
class
aggie
sneezed
and
looked
wretched
as
for
me
i
made
up
my
mind
then
and
there
that
if
letitia
carberry
was
going
to
such
a
neighborhood
she
was
not
going
alone
i
am
not
much
with
a
revolver
but
mighty
handy
with
a
pair
of
lungs
well
tish
had
it
all
worked
out
i
found
the
very
place
she
said
in
the
first
place
it
government
property
when
our
country
puts
aside
a
part
of
itself
as
a
public
domain
we
should
show
our
appreciation
in
the
second
place
it
wild
i
as
soon
spend
a
vacation
in
central
park
near
the
zoo
as
in
the
yellowstone
in
the
third
place
with
an
indian
reservation
on
one
side
and
a
national
forest
on
the
other
it
bound
to
be
lonely
any
tourist
she
said
scornfully
can
go
to
the
yosemite
and
be
photographed
under
a
redwood
tree
do
the
indians
stay
on
the
reservation
aggie
asked
feebly
probably
not
tish
observed
coldly
once
for
all
aggie
if
you
are
going
to
run
like
a
scared
deer
every
time
you
see
an
indian
or
a
bear
i
wish
you
would
go
to
asbury
park
she
forgot
herself
then
and
sat
down
quickly
an
action
which
was
followed
by
an
agonized
expression
tish
i
said
sharply
you
have
been
riding
a
horse
only
in
a
cinder
ring
she
replied
with
unwonted
docility
the
teacher
said
i
would
be
a
trifle
stiff
how
long
did
you
ride
not
more
than
twenty
minutes
she
said
the
lesson
was
to
be
an
hour
but
somebody
put
a
nickel
in
a
mechanical
piano
and
the
creature
i
was
on
started
going
sideways
well
she
had
fallen
off
and
had
to
be
taken
home
in
a
taxicab
when
aggie
heard
it
she
simply
took
the
pins
out
of
the
map
and
stuck
them
in
tish
cushion
her
mouth
was
set
tight
i
did
really
fall
tish
said
i
sat
down
and
it
was
cinders
and
not
hard
it
has
made
my
neck
stiff
that
all
that
enough
said
aggie
if
i
got
to
seek
pleasure
by
ramming
my
spinal
column
up
into
my
skull
and
crowding
my
brains
i
stay
at
home
you
ca
fall
out
of
a
western
saddle
tish
protested
rather
bitterly
and
if
i
were
you
aggie
i
would
worry
about
crowding
my
brains
however
she
probably
regretted
this
speech
for
she
added
more
gently
a
high
altitude
will
help
your
hay
fever
aggie
aggie
said
with
some
bitterness
that
her
hay
fever
did
not
need
to
be
helped
that
as
far
as
she
could
see
it
was
strong
and
flourishing
at
that
matters
rested
except
for
a
bit
of
conversation
just
before
we
left
aggie
had
put
on
her
sweater
vest
and
her
muffler
and
the
jacket
of
her
winter
suit
and
was
getting
into
her
fur
coat
when
tish
said
soft
as
mush
both
of
you
if
you
think
tish
carberry
i
began
that
i
apple
dumplings
said
tish
sofa
pillows
jellyfish
not
a
muscle
to
divide
between
you
i
drew
on
my
woolen
tights
angrily
elevators
tish
went
on
scornfully
street
cars
and
taxicabs
no
wonder
your
bodies
are
mere
masses
of
protoplasm
or
cellulose
or
whatever
it
is
since
when
said
aggie
have
you
been
walking
to
develop
yourself
tish
i
must
say
here
anger
brought
on
one
of
her
sneezing
attacks
and
she
was
unable
to
finish
tish
stood
before
us
oracularly
after
next
september
she
said
you
will
both
scorn
the
sloth
of
civilization
you
will
move
about
for
the
joy
of
moving
about
you
will
have
cast
off
the
shackles
of
the
flesh
and
be
born
anew
that
is
if
a
plan
of
mine
goes
through
lizzie
you
will
lose
fifty
pounds
well
i
did
want
to
lose
fifty
pounds
after
our
summer
in
the
maine
woods
i
had
gone
back
to
find
that
my
new
coat
which
had
fitted
me
exactly
and
being
stiffened
with
haircloth
kept
its
shape
off
and
looked
as
if
i
myself
were
hanging
to
the
hook
had
caved
in
on
me
in
several
places
just
as
i
had
gone
to
the
expense
of
having
it
taken
in
i
began
to
put
on
flesh
again
and
had
to
have
it
let
out
besides
no
woman
over
forty
should
ever
reduce
at
least
not
violently
she
wrinkles
my
face
that
summer
had
fallen
into
accordion
plaits
and
i
had
the
curious
feeling
of
having
enough
skin
for
two
aggie
had
suggested
at
that
time
that
i
have
my
cheeks
filled
out
with
paraffin
which
i
believe
cakes
and
gives
the
appearance
of
youth
but
ostermaier
knew
a
woman
who
had
done
so
and
being
hit
on
one
side
by
a
snowball
the
padding
broke
in
half
one
part
moving
up
under
her
eye
and
the
second
lodging
at
the
angle
of
her
jaw
she
tried
lying
on
a
bottle
to
melt
the
pieces
and
bring
them
together
again
but
they
did
not
remain
fixed
having
developed
a
wandering
habit
and
slipping
unexpectedly
now
and
then
ostermaier
says
it
is
painful
to
watch
her
holding
them
in
place
when
she
yawns
strangely
enough
however
a
few
weeks
later
tish
enthusiasm
for
the
west
had
apparently
vanished
when
several
weeks
went
by
and
the
atlas
had
disappeared
from
her
table
and
she
had
given
up
vegetarianism
for
swedish
movements
we
felt
that
we
were
to
have
a
quiet
summer
after
all
and
aggie
wrote
to
a
hotel
in
asbury
park
about
rooms
for
july
and
august
there
was
a
real
change
in
tish
she
stopped
knitting
abdominal
bands
for
the
soldiers
in
europe
for
one
thing
although
she
had
sent
over
almost
a
dozen
very
tasty
ones
in
the
evenings
when
we
dropped
in
to
chat
with
her
she
said
very
little
and
invariably
dozed
in
her
chair
on
one
such
occasion
aggie
having
inadvertently
stepped
on
the
rocker
of
her
chair
while
endeavoring
by
laying
a
hand
on
tish
brow
to
discover
if
she
was
feverish
the
chair
tilted
back
and
tish
wakened
with
a
jerk
she
immediately
fell
to
groaning
and
clasped
her
hands
to
the
small
of
her
back
quite
ignoring
poor
aggie
whom
the
chair
had
caught
in
the
epigastric
region
and
who
was
compelled
for
some
time
to
struggle
for
breath
jumping
jehoshaphat
said
tish
in
an
angry
tone
it
is
rare
for
tish
to
use
the
name
of
a
biblical
character
in
this
way
but
she
was
clearly
suffering
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
aggie
to
breathe
poor
aggie
replied
then
i
wish
tish
said
coldly
that
you
would
make
the
effort
some
place
else
than
on
the
rocker
of
my
chair
you
jarred
me
and
i
am
in
no
state
to
be
jarred
but
she
refused
to
explain
further
beyond
saying
in
reply
to
a
question
of
mine
that
she
was
not
feverish
and
that
she
had
not
been
asleep
having
merely
closed
her
eyes
to
rest
them
also
she
affirmed
that
she
was
not
taking
we
both
noticed
however
that
she
did
not
leave
her
chair
during
the
time
we
were
there
and
that
she
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
cushion
i
had
made
her
for
the
previous
christmas
and
on
which
i
had
embroidered
the
poet
moore
beautiful
words
come
rest
in
this
bosom
as
aggie
was
still
feeling
faint
i
advised
her
to
take
a
mouthful
of
blackberry
cordial
which
tish
keeps
for
emergencies
in
her
bathroom
closet
immediately
following
her
departure
the
calm
of
the
evening
was
broken
by
a
loud
shriek
it
appeared
on
my
rushing
to
the
bathroom
while
tish
sat
heartlessly
still
that
aggie
not
seeing
a
glass
had
placed
the
bottle
to
her
lips
and
taken
quite
a
large
mouthful
of
liniment
which
in
color
resembled
the
cordial
i
found
her
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bathtub
in
a
state
of
collapse
i
poisoned
she
groaned
oh
lizzie
i
am
not
fit
to
die
i
flew
with
the
bottle
to
tish
who
was
very
calm
and
stealthily
rubbing
one
of
her
ankles
do
her
good
tish
said
take
some
of
the
stiffness
out
of
her
liver
for
one
thing
but
you
might
keep
an
eye
on
her
it
full
of
alcohol
what
the
antidote
i
asked
hearing
aggie
low
groans
the
gold
cure
is
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
at
the
moment
said
tish
coldly
and
started
on
the
other
ankle
i
merely
record
this
incident
to
show
the
change
in
tish
aggie
was
not
seriously
upset
although
dizzy
for
an
hour
or
so
and
very
talkative
especially
about
wiggins
tish
was
changed
her
life
which
mostly
had
been
an
open
book
to
us
became
filled
with
mystery
there
were
whole
days
when
she
was
not
to
be
located
anywhere
and
evenings
as
i
have
stated
when
she
dozed
in
her
chair
as
usual
when
we
are
worried
about
tish
we
consulted
her
nephew
charlie
sands
but
like
all
members
of
the
masculine
sex
he
refused
to
be
worried
she
be
all
right
he
observed
she
takes
these
spells
but
trust
the
old
lady
to
come
up
smiling
it
either
christian
science
or
osteopathy
aggie
said
dolefully
she
not
herself
the
fruit
cake
she
sent
me
the
other
day
tasted
very
queer
and
hannah
thinks
she
put
ointment
in
instead
of
butter
ointments
observed
charlie
thoughtfully
and
salves
by
george
i
wonder
i
tell
you
he
said
i
keep
an
eye
open
for
a
few
days
the
symptoms
sound
like
but
never
mind
i
let
you
know
we
were
compelled
to
be
satisfied
with
this
but
for
several
days
we
lingered
in
anxiety
during
that
painful
interval
nothing
occurred
to
enlighten
us
except
one
conversation
with
tish
we
had
taken
dinner
with
her
and
she
seemed
to
be
all
right
again
and
more
than
usually
active
she
had
given
up
the
after
breaking
a
tooth
on
it
and
was
eating
rare
beef
which
she
had
heard
was
digested
in
the
spleen
or
some
such
place
thus
resting
the
stomach
for
a
time
she
left
us
however
immediately
after
the
meal
and
hannah
her
maid
tiptoed
into
the
room
i
that
nervous
i
could
scream
she
said
do
you
know
what
doing
now
no
hannah
i
said
with
bitter
sarcasm
long
ago
i
learned
never
to
surmise
what
miss
tish
is
doing
she
in
the
bathroom
standing
on
one
foot
and
waving
the
other
in
the
air
she
been
doing
it
hannah
said
for
weeks
first
one
foot
then
the
other
and
that
ai
all
you
been
spying
on
miss
tish
aggie
said
shame
on
you
hannah
i
have
miss
aggie
spy
i
have
and
spy
i
will
while
there
breath
in
my
body
twenty
years
have
i
do
you
know
what
she
does
when
she
come
home
from
these
sneakin
trips
of
hers
she
sits
in
a
hot
bath
until
the
wonder
is
that
her
blood
ai
turned
to
water
and
after
that
she
uses
liniment
her
underclothes
is
that
stained
up
with
it
that
i
ashamed
to
hang
out
here
tish
returned
and
after
a
suspicious
glance
at
hannah
sat
down
aggie
and
i
glanced
at
each
other
she
did
not
as
she
had
for
some
time
past
line
the
chair
with
pillows
and
there
was
an
air
about
her
almost
of
triumph
she
did
not
however
volunteer
any
explanation
aggie
and
i
were
driven
to
speculation
in
which
we
indulged
on
our
way
home
aggie
being
my
guest
at
the
time
on
account
of
her
janitor
children
having
measles
and
aggie
never
having
had
them
although
recalling
a
severe
rash
as
a
child
with
other
measly
symptoms
she
has
something
in
mind
for
next
summer
said
aggie
apprehensively
and
she
is
preparing
her
strength
for
it
tish
is
forehanded
if
nothing
else
well
i
remarked
with
some
bitterness
if
we
are
going
along
it
might
be
well
to
prepare
us
too
something
aggie
continued
that
requires
landing
on
one
foot
with
the
other
in
the
air
do
drivel
said
i
she
not
likely
going
into
the
russian
ballet
she
training
her
muscles
that
all
but
the
mystery
was
solved
the
following
morning
when
charlie
sands
called
me
up
i
got
it
beloved
aunt
he
said
got
what
said
i
what
the
old
lady
is
up
to
she
a
wonder
and
no
mistake
only
i
think
it
was
stingy
of
her
not
to
let
you
and
aunt
aggie
in
he
asked
me
to
get
aggie
and
meet
him
at
the
office
as
soon
as
possible
but
he
refused
to
explain
further
and
he
continued
to
refuse
until
we
had
arrived
at
our
destination
a
large
brick
building
in
the
center
of
the
city
now
he
said
take
a
long
breath
and
go
in
and
mind
no
excitement
we
went
in
there
was
a
band
playing
and
people
circling
at
a
mile
a
minute
in
the
center
there
was
a
cleared
place
and
tish
was
there
on
ice
skates
an
instructor
had
her
by
the
arm
and
as
we
looked
she
waved
him
off
gave
herself
a
shove
forward
with
one
foot
and
then
with
her
arms
waving
she
made
a
double
curve
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
the
outside
edge
by
george
said
charlie
sands
the
old
sport
unluckily
at
that
moment
tish
saw
us
and
sat
down
violently
on
the
ice
and
a
quite
young
man
fell
over
her
and
lay
stunned
for
several
seconds
we
rushed
round
the
arena
expecting
to
see
them
both
carried
out
but
tish
was
uninjured
and
came
skating
toward
us
with
her
hands
in
her
pockets
it
was
the
young
man
who
had
to
be
assisted
out
well
she
said
fetching
up
against
the
railing
with
a
bang
of
course
you
had
to
come
before
i
was
ready
for
you
in
a
week
i
really
be
skating
we
said
nothing
but
looked
at
her
and
i
am
afraid
our
glances
showed
disapproval
for
she
straightened
her
hat
with
a
jerk
well
she
said
you
not
all
of
a
sudden
are
you
ca
a
woman
take
a
little
exercise
without
her
family
and
friends
coming
snooping
round
and
acting
as
if
she
broken
the
ten
commandments
breaking
the
ten
commandments
i
said
witheringly
breaking
a
leg
more
likely
if
you
could
have
seen
yourself
tish
carberry
sprawled
on
that
ice
at
your
age
and
both
your
arteries
and
your
bones
brittle
as
the
specialist
told
you
and
i
heard
him
myself
you
take
those
things
off
your
feet
and
go
home
and
hide
your
head
i
wish
i
had
your
breath
lizzie
tish
said
i
be
a
submarine
diver
saying
which
she
skated
off
and
did
not
come
near
us
again
a
young
gentleman
went
up
to
her
and
asked
her
to
skate
though
i
doubt
if
she
had
ever
seen
him
before
and
as
we
left
the
building
in
disapproval
they
were
doing
fancy
turns
in
the
middle
of
the
place
and
a
crowd
was
gathering
round
them
owing
to
considerable
feeling
being
roused
by
the
foregoing
incident
we
did
not
see
much
of
tish
for
a
week
if
a
woman
wants
to
make
a
spectacle
of
herself
both
aggie
and
i
felt
that
she
needed
to
be
taught
a
lesson
besides
we
knew
tish
with
her
to
conquer
a
thing
is
to
lose
interest
on
the
anniversary
of
the
day
aggie
became
engaged
to
wiggins
tish
asked
us
both
to
dinner
and
we
buried
the
hatchet
or
rather
the
skates
it
was
when
dessert
came
that
we
realized
how
everything
that
had
occurred
had
been
preparation
for
the
summer
and
that
we
were
not
going
to
asbury
park
after
all
it
like
this
said
tish
hannah
go
out
and
close
the
door
and
do
stand
listening
i
have
figured
it
all
out
she
said
when
hannah
had
slammed
out
the
muscles
used
in
skating
are
the
ones
used
in
besides
there
may
be
times
when
a
pair
of
skates
would
be
handy
going
over
the
glaciers
it
not
called
glacier
park
for
nothing
i
dare
say
when
we
went
into
the
maine
woods
we
went
unprepared
this
time
i
intend
to
be
ready
for
any
emergency
but
we
gave
her
little
encouragement
we
would
go
along
and
told
her
so
but
further
than
that
i
refused
to
prepare
i
would
not
skate
and
said
so
very
well
lizzie
she
said
do
blame
me
if
you
find
yourself
unable
to
cope
with
mountain
hardships
i
merely
felt
this
way
if
each
of
us
could
do
one
thing
well
it
might
be
helpful
there
always
snow
and
if
aggie
would
learn
to
use
snowshoes
it
might
be
valuable
where
could
i
practice
aggie
demanded
but
tish
went
on
ignoring
aggie
sarcastic
tone
and
if
you
lizzie
would
learn
to
throw
a
lasso
or
lariat
i
believe
both
terms
are
correct
it
would
be
a
great
advantage
especially
in
case
of
meeting
ferocious
animals
the
park
laws
will
not
allow
us
to
kill
them
and
it
would
be
mighty
convenient
lizzie
not
to
mention
that
it
would
be
an
accomplishment
few
women
possess
i
refused
to
make
the
attempt
although
tish
sent
for
the
clothesline
and
with
the
aid
of
the
encyclopædia
made
a
loop
in
the
end
of
it
finally
she
became
interested
herself
and
when
we
left
rather
downhearted
at
ten
she
had
caught
the
three
times
and
broken
the
clock
aggie
and
i
prepared
with
little
enthusiasm
i
must
confess
we
had
as
much
love
for
the
rocks
and
rills
of
our
great
country
as
tish
but
as
aggie
observed
there
were
rocks
and
rocks
and
one
could
love
them
without
climbing
up
them
or
falling
off
them
the
only
comfort
we
had
was
that
charlie
sands
said
that
we
should
ride
ponies
and
not
horses
my
niece
children
have
a
pony
which
is
very
gentle
and
not
much
larger
than
a
dog
which
comes
up
on
the
porch
for
lumps
of
sugar
we
were
lured
to
a
false
sense
of
security
i
must
say
as
far
as
we
could
see
tish
was
making
few
preparations
for
the
trip
she
said
we
could
get
everything
we
needed
at
the
park
entrance
and
that
the
riding
was
merely
sitting
in
a
saddle
and
letting
the
pony
do
the
rest
but
on
the
of
june
the
anniversary
of
the
day
aggie
was
to
have
been
married
we
went
out
to
decorate
wiggins
last
and
coming
out
of
the
cemetery
we
met
tish
she
was
on
a
horse
astride
she
was
not
alone
a
gentleman
was
riding
beside
her
and
he
had
her
horse
by
a
long
leather
strap
she
pretended
not
to
see
us
and
aggie
unfortunately
waved
her
red
parasol
at
her
the
result
was
most
amazing
the
beast
she
was
on
jerked
itself
free
in
an
instant
and
with
the
same
movement
apparently
leaped
the
hedge
beside
the
road
one
moment
there
was
tish
in
a
derby
hat
and
breeches
and
the
next
moment
there
was
only
the
gentleman
with
his
mouth
open
aggie
collapsed
moaning
in
the
road
and
beyond
the
hedge
we
could
hear
the
horse
leaping
tombstones
in
the
cemetery
oh
tish
aggie
wailed
i
broke
my
way
through
the
hedge
to
find
what
was
left
of
her
while
the
bolted
for
the
gate
but
to
my
intense
surprise
tish
was
not
on
the
ground
then
i
saw
her
she
was
still
on
the
creature
and
she
was
coming
back
along
the
road
with
her
on
the
back
of
her
head
and
a
gleam
in
her
eye
that
i
knew
well
enough
was
a
gleam
of
triumph
she
halted
the
thing
beside
me
and
looked
down
with
a
patronizing
air
he
a
trifle
nervous
this
morning
she
said
calmly
has
been
worked
enough
good
horse
though
very
neat
jump
then
she
rode
on
and
out
through
the
gates
ignoring
aggie
pitiful
wail
and
scorning
the
the
instructor
offered
we
reached
glacier
park
without
difficulty
although
tish
insisted
on
talking
to
the
most
ordinary
people
on
the
train
and
once
losing
her
we
found
her
in
the
learning
to
play
bridge
although
not
a
except
for
casino
though
nothing
has
ever
been
said
i
believe
she
learned
when
too
late
that
they
were
playing
for
money
as
she
borrowed
ten
dollars
from
me
late
in
the
afternoon
and
was
looking
rather
pale
what
do
you
think
she
said
while
i
was
getting
the
money
from
the
safety
pocket
under
my
skirt
the
young
man
who
knocked
me
down
on
the
ice
that
day
is
on
the
train
i
just
exchanged
a
few
words
with
him
he
was
not
much
hurt
although
unconscious
for
a
short
time
his
name
is
bell
james
c
bell
soon
after
that
tish
brought
him
to
us
and
we
had
a
nice
talk
he
said
he
had
not
been
badly
hurt
on
the
ice
although
he
got
a
cut
on
the
forehead
from
tish
skate
requiring
two
stitches
after
a
time
he
and
aggie
went
out
on
the
platform
only
returning
when
aggie
got
a
cinder
in
her
eye
just
think
she
said
as
he
went
for
water
to
use
in
my
he
is
going
to
meet
the
girl
he
is
in
love
with
out
at
the
park
she
has
been
there
for
four
weeks
they
are
engaged
he
is
very
much
in
love
he
did
talk
of
anything
else
she
told
him
she
had
confided
his
tender
secret
to
us
and
instead
of
looking
conscious
he
seemed
glad
to
have
three
people
instead
of
one
to
talk
to
about
her
you
see
it
like
this
he
said
she
is
very
good
looking
and
in
her
town
a
company
has
its
studio
that
part
all
right
i
suppose
we
have
to
have
movies
but
the
fool
of
a
director
met
her
at
a
party
and
said
she
would
photograph
well
and
ought
to
be
with
them
he
offered
her
a
salary
and
it
went
to
her
head
she
young
he
added
and
he
said
she
could
be
as
great
a
hit
as
mary
pickford
how
sad
said
aggie
but
of
course
she
refused
well
no
she
liked
the
idea
it
got
me
worried
worried
her
people
too
her
father
able
to
give
her
a
good
home
and
i
expecting
to
take
that
job
off
his
hands
in
about
a
year
but
girls
are
queer
she
wanted
to
try
it
awfully
it
developed
that
he
had
gone
to
her
folks
about
it
and
they
offered
her
a
vacation
with
some
of
her
school
friends
in
glacier
park
it
pretty
wild
out
there
he
went
on
and
we
felt
that
the
air
and
horseback
riding
and
everything
would
make
her
forget
the
movies
i
hope
so
she
there
now
but
she
had
the
bug
pretty
hard
got
so
she
was
always
posing
without
knowing
it
but
he
was
hopeful
that
she
would
be
cured
and
said
she
was
to
meet
him
at
the
station
she
an
awfully
nice
girl
you
understand
he
finished
it
only
that
this
thing
got
hold
of
her
and
needed
driving
out
well
we
were
watching
when
the
train
drew
in
at
glacier
park
station
and
she
was
there
she
was
a
very
pretty
girl
and
it
was
quite
touching
to
see
him
look
at
her
but
aggie
observed
something
and
remarked
on
it
she
not
as
glad
to
see
him
as
he
is
to
see
her
she
said
he
was
going
to
kiss
her
and
she
moved
back
in
the
crowd
we
lost
sight
of
them
but
that
evening
sitting
in
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
we
saw
bell
wandering
round
alone
he
looked
depressed
and
aggie
beckoned
to
him
how
is
everything
she
asked
is
the
cure
working
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
looked
straight
ahead
not
so
you
could
notice
it
he
said
bitterly
would
you
believe
that
there
a
outfit
here
taking
scenes
in
the
park
no
there
is
they
taken
two
thousand
feet
of
her
already
dressed
like
an
indian
he
said
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
fury
it
makes
me
sick
i
dare
say
if
we
tied
her
in
a
well
some
fool
would
lower
a
camera
on
a
rope
just
at
that
moment
she
sauntered
past
us
with
a
young
man
bell
ignored
her
although
i
saw
her
try
to
catch
his
eye
that
the
man
with
her
he
said
in
a
low
violent
tone
when
they
had
passed
name
oliver
he
groaned
he
told
her
she
ought
to
go
in
for
the
business
she
be
a
second
mary
pickford
like
to
kill
him
he
rose
savagely
and
left
us
we
spent
the
night
in
the
hotel
at
the
park
entrance
and
i
could
not
get
to
sleep
tish
was
busy
engaging
a
guide
and
going
over
our
supplies
and
at
eleven
aggie
came
into
my
room
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
i
ca
sleep
lizzie
she
said
that
poor
bell
is
on
my
mind
besides
did
you
see
those
ferocious
indians
hanging
round
well
i
had
seen
them
but
said
nothing
they
would
scalp
one
as
quick
as
not
aggie
went
on
and
who
to
know
but
that
our
guide
will
be
in
league
with
them
i
lost
my
teeth
she
said
with
a
flash
of
spirit
but
so
far
i
kept
my
hair
and
mean
to
if
possible
that
old
indian
has
a
scalp
tied
to
the
end
of
a
stick
lizzie
i
nervous
if
it
is
only
hair
they
want
i
do
mind
their
taking
my
switch
i
observed
trying
to
be
facetious
although
uneasy
as
to
the
switch
it
no
longer
matched
my
hair
and
i
would
have
parted
from
it
without
a
pang
and
another
thing
said
aggie
tish
can
talk
about
ponies
until
she
is
black
in
the
face
the
creatures
are
horses
i
seen
them
well
i
knew
that
too
by
that
time
as
we
walked
to
the
hotel
from
the
train
i
had
seen
one
of
than
carrying
on
it
was
arching
its
back
like
a
cat
that
just
seen
a
strange
dog
and
with
every
arch
it
swelled
its
stomach
at
the
third
heave
it
split
the
strap
that
held
the
saddle
on
and
then
it
kicked
up
in
the
rear
and
sent
saddle
and
rider
over
its
head
so
far
as
i
had
seen
no
casualty
had
resulted
but
it
had
set
me
thinking
given
a
beast
with
an
spine
and
no
sense
of
honor
i
felt
i
would
be
helpless
tish
came
in
just
then
and
we
confronted
her
illustration
it
well
enough
for
you
tish
carberry
to
talk
about
gripping
a
horse
with
your
knees
ponies
i
said
bitterly
they
are
horses
if
i
know
a
horse
and
moreover
it
well
enough
for
you
tish
carberry
to
talk
about
gripping
a
horse
with
your
knees
i
not
built
that
way
and
you
know
it
besides
no
knee
grip
will
answer
when
a
creature
begins
to
act
like
a
cat
in
a
fit
aggie
here
had
a
bright
idea
she
said
that
she
had
seen
pictures
of
pneumatic
jackets
to
keep
people
from
drowning
and
that
mckee
a
buyer
at
one
of
the
stores
at
home
had
taken
one
fully
inflated
when
he
crossed
to
paris
for
autumn
suits
i
would
like
to
have
one
tish
she
finished
it
would
break
the
force
of
a
fall
anyhow
even
if
it
did
puncture
tish
who
was
still
dressed
went
out
to
the
curio
shop
in
the
lobby
and
returned
with
the
sad
news
that
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
on
sale
we
were
late
in
getting
started
the
next
morning
owing
partly
to
having
put
her
on
wrong
and
being
unable
to
sit
down
when
once
in
the
saddle
but
the
main
reason
was
the
guide
we
had
engaged
tish
heard
him
using
profane
language
to
one
of
the
horses
and
dismissed
him
on
the
spot
the
man
who
was
providing
our
horses
and
outfit
however
understood
and
in
a
short
time
returned
with
another
man
i
got
a
good
one
for
you
now
miss
carberry
he
said
safe
and
perfectly
gentle
and
as
mild
as
milk
only
has
one
fault
and
maybe
you
wo
mind
that
he
smokes
considerably
i
do
object
as
long
as
it
in
the
open
air
tish
said
so
that
was
arranged
but
i
must
say
that
the
new
man
did
not
look
mild
he
had
red
hair
although
a
nice
smile
with
a
gold
tooth
and
his
trousers
were
of
white
fur
which
looked
hot
for
summer
you
are
sure
that
you
do
use
strong
language
tish
asked
no
he
said
i
was
raised
strict
and
very
particular
as
to
swearing
dear
dear
now
would
you
look
at
that
cinch
blow
up
their
little
tummies
they
do
when
they
cinched
and
when
they
breathe
it
out
the
saddle
as
loose
as
the
tongues
of
some
of
these
here
tourists
tish
swung
herself
up
without
any
trouble
but
owing
to
a
large
canvas
bag
on
the
back
of
my
saddle
i
was
unable
to
get
my
leg
across
and
was
compelled
to
have
it
worked
over
a
little
at
a
time
at
last
however
we
were
ready
a
white
carrying
our
tents
and
was
led
by
bill
which
proved
to
be
the
name
of
our
cowboy
guide
bell
came
to
say
and
to
wish
us
luck
but
he
looked
unhappy
and
there
was
no
sign
whatever
of
the
young
lady
whose
name
we
had
learned
was
helen
i
may
see
you
on
the
trail
he
said
sadly
i
about
sick
of
this
place
and
i
thinking
of
clearing
out
aggie
reminded
him
that
faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
but
he
only
shook
his
head
i
not
so
sure
that
i
want
to
win
he
said
marriage
is
a
serious
business
and
i
do
know
that
i
care
to
have
a
wife
that
followed
a
camera
like
a
street
kid
follows
a
brass
band
it
would
make
for
a
quiet
home
we
left
him
staring
wistfully
into
the
distance
tish
sat
in
her
saddle
and
surveyed
the
mountain
peaks
that
rose
behind
the
hotel
twenty
centuries
are
looking
down
upon
us
she
said
the
crest
of
our
native
land
lies
before
us
we
will
conquer
those
beetling
crags
or
die
trying
all
right
bill
forward
bill
led
off
followed
by
the
then
tish
aggie
and
myself
we
kept
on
in
this
order
for
some
time
which
gave
me
a
chance
to
observe
aggie
carefully
i
am
not
much
of
a
horsewoman
myself
having
never
been
on
a
horse
before
but
my
father
was
fond
of
riding
and
i
soon
adapted
myself
to
the
horse
gait
especially
when
walking
on
level
stretches
however
where
bill
spurred
his
horse
to
a
trot
i
was
not
so
comfortable
and
aggie
appeared
to
strike
the
saddle
in
a
different
spot
every
time
she
descended
once
on
her
turning
her
profile
to
me
in
a
glance
of
despair
i
was
struck
by
the
strange
and
collapsed
appearance
of
her
face
this
was
explained
however
when
my
horse
caught
up
to
hers
on
a
wider
stretch
of
road
and
i
saw
that
she
had
taken
out
her
teeth
and
was
holding
them
in
her
hand
swallowed
them
she
gasped
oh
lizzie
to
think
of
a
summer
of
this
at
last
we
left
the
road
and
turned
onto
a
footpath
which
instantly
commenced
to
rise
tish
called
back
something
about
the
beauties
of
nature
and
riding
over
a
carpet
of
flowers
but
my
horse
was
fording
a
small
stream
at
the
time
and
i
was
too
occupied
to
reply
the
path
or
trail
which
is
what
bill
called
it
grew
more
steep
and
i
let
go
of
the
lines
and
held
to
the
horn
of
my
saddle
the
horses
were
climbing
like
goats
tish
aggie
called
desperately
i
ca
stand
this
i
going
back
i
lordamighty
fortunately
tish
did
not
hear
this
we
had
suddenly
emerged
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
a
path
clung
to
the
cliff
and
along
the
very
edge
of
this
the
horses
walked
looking
down
in
an
interested
manner
now
and
then
my
blood
turned
to
water
and
i
closed
my
eyes
tish
aggie
shrieked
but
the
only
effect
of
this
was
to
start
her
horse
into
a
trot
i
had
closed
my
eyes
but
i
opened
them
in
time
to
see
aggie
give
a
wild
clutch
and
a
low
moan
in
a
few
moments
the
trail
left
the
edge
and
aggie
turned
in
her
saddle
and
looked
back
at
me
i
lost
my
lower
set
back
there
she
said
they
went
over
the
edge
i
suppose
they
falling
yet
it
a
good
thing
it
was
the
upper
set
i
said
to
comfort
her
as
far
as
appearance
goes
appearance
she
said
bitterly
do
you
suppose
we
meet
anybody
but
desperadoes
and
indians
in
a
place
like
this
and
not
an
egg
with
us
of
course
the
eggs
referred
to
her
diet
as
at
different
times
when
having
her
teeth
repaired
she
can
eat
little
else
ham
she
called
back
in
a
surly
tone
and
hard
tack
i
suppose
starve
lizzie
that
all
if
only
we
had
brought
some
junket
tablets
with
the
exception
of
this
incident
the
morning
was
quiet
tish
and
bill
talked
prohibition
which
he
believed
in
and
the
tin
pans
on
the
clattered
and
we
got
higher
all
the
time
and
rode
through
waterfalls
and
along
the
edge
of
death
by
noon
i
did
not
much
care
if
the
horses
fell
over
or
not
the
skin
was
off
me
in
a
number
of
places
and
my
horse
did
not
like
me
and
showed
it
by
nipping
back
at
my
leg
here
and
there
at
eleven
riding
through
a
valley
on
a
trail
six
inches
wide
bill
horse
stepped
on
a
hornets
nest
the
insects
were
probably
dazed
at
first
but
by
the
time
tish
horse
arrived
they
were
prepared
and
the
next
thing
we
knew
tish
horse
was
flying
up
the
as
if
it
had
gone
crazy
and
bill
was
shouting
to
us
to
stop
the
last
we
saw
of
tish
for
some
time
was
her
horse
leaping
a
mountain
stream
and
jumping
like
a
kangaroo
and
bill
was
following
she
be
killed
aggie
cried
oh
tish
tish
do
yell
i
said
you
start
the
horses
and
for
heaven
sake
aggie
i
added
grimly
remember
that
this
is
a
pleasure
trip
it
was
a
before
tish
and
bill
returned
tish
was
a
chastened
woman
she
said
little
or
nothing
but
borrowed
some
ointment
from
me
for
her
face
where
the
branches
of
trees
had
scraped
it
while
bill
led
the
horses
round
the
fatal
spot
i
recall
however
that
she
said
she
wished
now
that
we
had
brought
the
other
guide
because
i
feel
she
observed
that
a
little
strong
language
would
be
a
relief
we
had
luncheon
at
noon
in
a
sylvan
glade
and
aggie
was
pathetic
she
dipped
a
cracker
in
a
cup
of
tea
and
sat
off
by
herself
under
a
tree
tish
however
had
recovered
her
spirits
throw
out
your
chests
and
breathe
deep
of
this
pure
air
unsullied
by
civilization
she
cried
aggie
fill
yourself
with
ozone
humph
said
aggie
it
about
all
i
will
fill
myself
with
think
tish
observed
of
the
fools
and
dolts
who
are
living
under
roofs
struggling
contending
plotting
while
all
nature
awaits
them
with
stings
aggie
said
nastily
and
teeth
and
horns
and
claws
and
every
old
thing
tish
i
want
to
go
back
i
not
happy
and
i
enjoy
scenery
when
i
not
happy
besides
i
ca
eat
the
landscape
as
i
look
back
i
believe
it
would
have
been
better
if
we
had
returned
i
think
of
that
day
some
time
later
when
we
made
the
long
descent
from
the
piegan
pass
under
such
extraordinary
circumstances
and
i
realize
that
although
worse
for
our
bodies
which
had
grown
strong
and
agile
so
that
i
have
later
on
seen
aggie
mount
her
horse
on
a
run
it
would
have
been
better
for
our
nerves
had
we
returned
we
were
all
perfectly
stiff
after
luncheon
and
aggie
was
sulking
also
bill
was
compelled
to
lift
us
into
our
saddles
and
again
we
started
up
and
up
the
trail
was
now
what
he
called
a
switchback
halfway
up
aggie
refused
to
go
farther
but
on
looking
back
decided
not
to
return
either
i
shall
not
go
another
step
she
called
here
i
am
and
here
i
stay
till
i
die
very
well
tish
said
from
overhead
i
suppose
you
do
expect
us
all
to
stay
and
die
with
you
i
tell
your
niece
when
i
see
her
aggie
thought
better
of
it
however
and
followed
on
with
her
eyes
closed
and
her
lips
moving
in
prayer
she
happened
to
open
them
at
a
bad
place
although
safe
enough
according
to
bill
and
nothing
to
what
we
were
coming
to
a
few
days
later
opening
them
as
she
did
on
a
ledge
of
rock
which
sloped
steeply
for
what
appeared
to
be
several
miles
down
on
each
side
she
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
followed
by
a
sneeze
as
before
her
horse
started
to
run
and
aggie
is
i
believe
bill
said
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
ever
took
that
place
at
a
canter
we
were
to
take
things
easy
the
first
day
bill
advised
till
you
get
your
muscles
sort
of
eased
up
ladies
he
said
if
you
have
been
riding
astride
a
horse
back
seems
as
wide
as
the
roof
of
a
church
but
we
get
a
rest
now
the
rest
of
the
way
is
walking
i
ca
walk
aggie
said
i
ca
get
my
knees
together
sorry
said
bill
we
going
down
now
and
the
animals
has
to
be
led
that
one
of
the
diversions
of
a
trip
like
this
first
you
ride
and
than
you
walk
and
then
you
ride
again
this
here
one
of
the
show
places
although
easy
of
access
from
the
entrance
be
a
good
place
for
a
holdup
i
always
said
a
holdup
tish
asked
her
enthusiasm
seemed
to
have
flagged
somewhat
but
at
this
she
brightened
up
yes
you
see
we
near
the
canadian
border
and
it
would
be
easy
for
a
gang
to
slip
over
and
back
again
do
know
why
we
never
had
one
yellowstone
can
boast
of
a
number
i
observed
tartly
that
i
considered
it
nothing
to
boast
of
but
bill
did
not
agree
with
me
it
does
hurt
a
neighborhood
none
he
observed
adds
romance
as
you
might
say
he
went
on
and
happening
to
slide
on
a
piece
of
shale
at
that
moment
i
sat
down
unexpectedly
and
the
horse
put
its
foot
on
me
i
felt
embittered
and
helpless
but
the
others
kept
on
very
well
i
said
go
on
do
mind
me
if
this
creature
wants
to
sit
in
my
lap
well
and
good
i
expect
it
tired
but
as
they
went
on
callously
i
was
obliged
to
shove
the
creature
off
and
to
hobble
on
bill
was
still
babbling
about
holdups
and
aggie
was
saying
that
he
was
sunstruck
but
of
course
it
did
not
matter
we
made
very
slow
progress
owing
to
taking
frequent
rests
and
late
in
the
afternoon
we
were
overtaken
by
bell
on
foot
and
carrying
a
pack
he
would
have
passed
on
without
stopping
but
aggie
hailed
him
not
going
to
hike
are
you
she
said
pleasantly
aggie
is
fond
of
picking
up
the
vernacular
of
a
region
no
he
said
in
a
surly
tone
quite
unlike
his
former
urbane
manner
i
merely
taking
this
pack
out
for
a
walk
but
he
stopped
and
mopped
his
face
to
tell
you
the
truth
ladies
he
said
i
working
off
a
little
steam
that
all
i
was
afraid
if
i
stayed
round
the
hotel
i
do
something
i
be
sorry
for
there
are
times
when
i
am
not
a
fit
companion
for
any
one
and
this
is
one
of
them
we
invited
him
to
join
us
but
he
refused
no
i
better
alone
he
said
when
things
get
too
strong
for
me
on
the
trail
i
can
sling
things
about
i
been
throwing
boulders
down
the
mountain
every
now
and
then
i
just
as
soon
they
hit
somebody
as
not
also
he
added
i
safer
away
from
any
men
we
saw
him
glance
at
bill
and
understood
oliver
was
love
an
awful
thing
said
bill
as
the
young
man
went
on
kicking
stones
out
of
his
way
i
glad
i
ai
got
it
tish
turned
and
eyed
him
true
love
is
a
very
beautiful
thing
she
rebuked
him
although
a
single
woman
myself
i
believe
in
it
live
with
me
and
be
my
love
she
quoted
sitting
down
to
shake
a
stone
out
of
her
bill
looked
startled
i
might
say
he
said
hastily
that
i
may
have
misled
you
ladies
i
married
you
said
you
had
never
been
in
love
tish
said
sharply
well
not
to
say
real
love
he
replied
she
was
the
cook
of
an
outfit
i
was
with
and
it
just
came
about
natural
she
was
going
to
leave
which
meant
that
i
have
to
do
the
cooking
which
i
ai
much
at
especially
pastry
so
i
married
her
tish
gave
him
a
scornful
glance
but
said
nothing
and
we
went
on
we
camped
late
that
afternoon
beside
two
medicine
lake
and
while
bill
put
up
the
tents
the
three
of
us
sat
on
a
log
and
soaked
our
aching
feet
in
the
water
which
was
melted
glacier
and
naturally
cold
what
was
our
surprise
on
turning
somewhat
to
see
the
angry
lover
fishing
on
a
point
near
by
while
we
stared
he
pulled
out
a
large
trout
and
stalked
away
without
a
glance
in
our
direction
as
tish
with
her
usual
forethought
had
brought
a
trout
rod
she
hastily
procured
it
but
without
result
of
course
aggie
said
no
fish
i
could
eat
a
piece
of
broiled
fish
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
skin
and
bone
at
the
end
of
this
trip
and
not
much
skin
bill
had
set
up
the
and
built
a
fire
and
it
looked
cozy
and
comfortable
but
tish
had
the
young
man
on
her
mind
and
after
supper
she
put
on
a
skirt
which
she
had
brought
along
and
went
to
see
him
i
take
him
some
supper
bill
she
said
but
you
are
correct
you
are
no
cook
she
disappeared
among
the
bushes
only
to
return
in
a
short
time
jerking
off
her
skirt
as
she
came
he
says
all
he
wants
is
to
be
let
alone
she
said
briefly
i
must
say
i
disappointed
in
him
he
was
very
agreeable
before
i
pass
without
comment
over
the
night
bill
had
put
up
the
tent
over
the
root
of
a
large
tree
and
we
disposed
ourselves
about
it
as
well
as
we
could
in
the
course
of
the
night
one
of
the
horses
broke
loose
and
put
its
head
inside
the
tent
owing
to
aggie
thinking
it
was
a
bear
tish
shot
at
it
fortunately
missing
it
but
the
frightened
animal
ran
away
and
bill
was
until
noon
the
next
day
finding
it
we
cooked
our
own
breakfast
and
tish
made
some
gems
having
brought
the
pan
along
but
the
morning
dragged
although
the
scenery
was
lovely
at
twelve
bill
brought
the
horse
back
and
came
over
to
us
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
it
miss
carberry
he
observed
you
a
bit
too
ready
with
that
gun
first
thing
you
know
you
put
a
hole
through
me
and
then
where
will
you
be
i
got
along
without
men
most
of
my
life
tish
said
sharply
i
reckon
we
manage
well
he
said
there
another
angle
to
it
where
would
i
be
that
between
you
and
your
creator
tish
retorted
we
went
on
again
that
afternoon
and
climbed
another
precipice
we
saw
no
human
being
except
a
mountain
goat
although
bill
claimed
to
have
seen
a
bear
tish
was
quite
calm
at
all
times
and
had
got
so
that
she
could
look
down
into
eternity
without
a
shudder
but
aggie
and
i
were
still
nervous
and
at
the
steepest
places
we
got
off
and
walked
the
unfortunate
part
was
that
the
exercise
and
the
mountain
air
made
aggie
hungry
and
there
was
little
that
she
could
eat
if
any
one
had
told
me
a
month
ago
she
said
mopping
her
forehead
that
i
would
be
scaling
the
peaks
of
my
country
on
crackers
and
tea
i
would
have
believed
it
i
done
out
lizzie
i
ca
climb
another
inch
bill
was
ahead
with
the
pack
horse
and
tish
overhearing
her
called
back
some
advice
take
your
horse
tail
and
let
him
pull
you
up
aggie
she
said
read
it
somewhere
aggie
although
frequently
complaining
always
does
as
tish
suggests
so
she
took
the
horse
tail
when
a
totally
unexpected
thing
happened
docile
as
the
creature
generally
was
it
objected
at
once
and
kicked
out
with
both
rear
feet
in
a
moment
it
seemed
to
me
aggie
was
gone
and
her
horse
was
moving
on
alone
aggie
i
called
in
a
panic
tish
stopped
and
we
both
looked
about
then
we
saw
her
lying
on
a
ledge
about
ten
feet
below
the
trail
she
was
flat
on
her
back
and
her
was
gone
but
she
was
uninjured
although
shaken
for
as
we
looked
she
sat
up
and
an
agonized
expression
came
over
her
face
aggie
i
cried
is
anything
broken
damnation
said
aggie
in
an
awful
voice
the
upper
set
is
gone
i
have
set
down
exactly
what
aggie
said
i
admit
that
the
provocation
was
great
but
tish
was
not
one
to
make
allowances
and
she
turned
and
went
on
leaving
us
alone
she
is
not
without
feeling
however
for
from
the
top
of
the
pass
she
sent
bill
down
with
a
rope
and
we
dragged
poor
aggie
to
the
trail
again
her
nerves
were
shaken
and
she
was
repentant
also
for
when
she
found
that
her
hat
was
gone
she
said
nothing
although
her
eyes
took
on
a
hunted
look
at
the
top
of
the
pass
tish
was
sitting
on
a
stone
she
had
taken
her
from
the
saddle
where
she
always
kept
it
handy
and
was
drawing
up
a
hole
in
her
stocking
i
observed
to
her
pleasantly
that
it
was
a
sign
of
scandal
to
mend
clothing
while
still
on
but
she
ignored
me
although
as
i
reflected
bitterly
i
had
not
been
kicked
over
the
cliff
it
was
a
subdued
and
speechless
aggie
who
followed
us
that
afternoon
along
the
trail
as
her
hat
was
gone
i
took
the
spare
dish
towel
and
made
a
turban
for
her
with
an
end
hanging
down
to
protect
the
back
of
her
neck
but
she
expressed
little
gratitude
beyond
observing
that
as
she
was
going
over
the
edge
piecemeal
she
better
have
done
it
all
at
once
and
be
through
with
it
the
afternoon
wore
away
slowly
it
seemed
a
long
time
until
we
reached
our
partly
because
although
a
small
eater
ordinarily
the
air
and
exercise
had
made
me
feel
famished
but
the
disagreement
between
tish
and
aggie
owing
to
the
latter
unfortunate
exclamation
while
kicked
over
the
cliff
made
the
time
seem
longer
there
was
not
the
usual
exchange
of
pleasant
nothings
between
us
but
by
six
tish
was
more
amiable
having
seen
bear
scratches
on
trees
near
the
camp
and
anticipating
the
sight
of
a
bear
she
mixed
up
a
small
cup
cake
while
bill
was
putting
up
our
tent
and
then
taking
her
rod
proceeded
to
fish
while
aggie
and
i
searched
for
grasshoppers
these
were
few
owing
to
the
altitude
but
we
caught
four
which
we
imprisoned
in
a
with
them
tish
caught
four
trout
and
broiling
them
nicely
she
offered
one
to
poor
aggie
it
was
a
peace
offering
and
taken
as
such
so
that
we
were
soon
on
our
former
agreeable
footing
and
all
forgotten
the
next
day
it
rained
and
we
were
obliged
to
sit
in
the
tent
bill
sat
with
us
and
talked
mainly
of
desperadoes
as
i
observed
before
he
said
there
has
been
any
tourist
holdup
yet
but
it
bound
to
come
take
the
yellowstone
now
one
holdup
a
year
the
average
and
it
full
of
soldiers
at
that
it
a
wonder
people
keep
on
going
i
observed
moving
out
of
a
puddle
oh
i
do
know
he
said
in
one
way
it
good
business
i
take
it
this
way
when
folks
come
west
they
want
the
west
they
read
about
what
do
they
care
for
irrigation
and
apple
orchards
what
they
like
is
danger
and
a
little
gunplay
the
sort
of
thing
they
see
in
these
here
moving
pictures
i
sure
i
do
aggie
remarked
it
was
growing
dusk
and
she
peered
out
into
the
forest
round
us
there
is
something
crackling
out
there
now
she
said
only
a
bear
likely
bill
assured
her
we
have
a
sight
of
bears
here
no
they
want
danger
and
every
holdup
an
advertisement
you
see
the
government
ca
advertise
these
here
parks
not
the
way
it
should
anyhow
but
a
holdup
news
so
the
papers
print
it
and
it
sets
people
to
thinking
about
the
park
maybe
they
never
thought
of
the
place
and
are
arranging
to
go
elsewhere
then
along
comes
a
gang
and
raises
h
raises
trouble
and
the
park
in
every
one
mouth
so
to
speak
we
get
considerable
business
if
there
was
one
this
summer
at
that
moment
the
crackling
outside
increased
and
a
shadowy
form
emerged
from
the
bushes
even
bill
stood
up
and
aggie
screamed
it
was
however
only
poor
bell
mind
if
i
borrow
some
matches
he
said
gruffly
we
ca
lend
matches
tish
replied
at
least
i
do
see
the
use
of
sending
them
back
after
they
been
lighted
we
can
give
you
some
my
mistake
he
said
that
was
all
he
said
except
the
word
thanks
when
i
reached
him
a
box
he
a
surly
creature
tish
observed
as
he
crackled
through
the
brush
again
more
than
likely
that
girl
better
off
without
him
he
looks
rather
downhearted
aggie
remarked
much
that
we
think
is
temper
is
due
to
unhappiness
much
of
your
charitable
view
is
due
to
a
good
dinner
too
tish
said
here
we
are
in
the
center
of
the
wilderness
with
great
peaks
on
every
hand
and
we
meet
a
fellow
creature
who
speaks
nine
words
and
begrudges
those
if
he
as
stingy
with
money
as
with
language
she
hard
a
narrow
escape
he
had
kind
of
a
raw
deal
bill
put
in
the
girl
was
stuck
on
him
all
right
until
this
chap
came
along
he
offered
to
take
some
pictures
with
her
in
them
and
it
was
all
off
they
making
up
a
play
now
and
she
to
be
in
it
what
sort
of
a
play
tish
demanded
sorry
not
to
oblige
bill
replied
ca
say
the
nature
of
it
but
all
of
us
felt
that
bill
knew
and
would
not
say
tish
to
whom
a
mystery
is
a
personal
affront
determined
to
find
out
for
herself
and
when
later
in
the
evening
we
saw
the
light
of
it
was
tish
herself
who
suggested
that
we
go
over
and
visit
with
him
we
can
converse
about
various
things
she
said
and
take
his
mind
from
his
troubles
but
it
would
be
better
not
to
mention
affairs
of
the
heart
he
probably
sensitive
so
we
left
bill
to
look
after
things
and
went
to
call
on
bell
it
was
farther
to
his
camp
than
it
had
appeared
and
tish
unfortunately
ran
into
a
tree
and
bruised
her
nose
badly
when
it
had
stopped
bleeding
however
we
went
on
and
at
last
arrived
he
was
sitting
on
a
log
by
the
fire
smoking
a
pipe
and
looking
very
sad
behind
him
was
a
bit
of
a
tent
not
much
larger
than
an
umbrella
aggie
touched
my
arm
my
heart
aches
for
him
she
said
there
is
despair
in
his
very
eyes
i
do
not
believe
that
at
first
he
was
very
glad
to
see
us
but
he
softened
somewhat
when
tish
held
out
the
cake
she
had
brought
that
very
nice
of
you
he
said
rising
i
afraid
i
ca
ask
you
to
sit
down
the
ground
wet
and
there
is
only
this
log
i
sat
on
logs
before
tish
replied
we
thought
we
call
seeing
we
are
neighbors
as
the
first
comers
it
was
our
place
to
call
first
of
course
i
see
he
said
and
poked
up
the
fire
with
a
piece
of
stick
we
felt
that
you
might
be
lonely
said
aggie
i
came
here
to
be
lonely
he
replied
gloomily
i
want
to
be
lonely
tish
however
was
determined
to
be
cheerful
and
asked
him
as
a
safe
subject
how
he
felt
about
the
war
war
he
said
that
so
there
is
a
war
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
forgotten
about
it
i
been
thinking
of
other
things
we
saw
that
it
was
going
to
be
difficult
to
cheer
him
tish
tried
the
weather
which
brought
us
nowhere
as
he
merely
grunted
but
aggie
broached
the
subject
of
desperadoes
and
he
roused
somewhat
there
are
plenty
of
shady
characters
in
the
park
he
said
shortly
wolves
in
sheep
clothing
that
what
they
are
bill
our
guide
says
there
may
be
a
holdup
at
any
time
sure
there
is
he
said
calmly
there
one
going
to
be
pulled
off
in
the
next
day
or
two
we
sat
petrified
and
aggie
eyes
were
starting
out
of
her
head
all
the
trimmings
he
went
on
staring
at
the
fire
innocent
and
unsuspecting
tourists
lunch
laughter
boiled
coffee
and
cold
ham
ambush
the
whole
business
followed
by
highwaymen
in
flannel
shirts
and
revolvers
dead
tourist
or
two
desperate
resistance
everything
aggie
rose
pale
as
an
aspen
you
you
are
joking
she
cried
do
i
look
like
it
he
demanded
fiercely
i
tell
you
there
is
going
to
be
the
whole
thing
at
the
end
the
lovely
girl
will
escape
on
horseback
and
ride
madly
for
aid
she
will
meet
the
sheriff
and
a
posse
who
are
out
for
a
picnic
or
some
such
damfool
nonsense
and
young
man
tish
said
coldly
if
you
know
all
this
why
are
you
sitting
here
and
not
alarming
the
authorities
pooh
he
said
disagreeably
it
a
scheme
to
advertise
the
park
yellowstone
got
ahead
of
them
this
year
and
has
had
its
excitement
with
all
the
papers
ringing
with
it
that
was
a
gag
too
probably
do
you
mean
i
mean
considerable
he
said
that
movie
idiot
will
be
on
a
rise
taking
the
tourists
as
they
ride
through
of
course
he
expect
the
holdup
not
in
the
papers
anyhow
he
happens
to
have
the
camera
trained
on
the
party
and
gets
it
all
result
a
whacking
good
picture
revolvers
firing
blank
cartridges
everything
which
people
will
crowd
to
see
oh
it
good
business
all
right
i
do
mind
admitting
that
tish
face
expressed
the
greatest
rage
she
rose
drawing
herself
to
her
full
height
and
the
tourists
she
demanded
they
lend
themselves
to
this
imposition
to
this
infamy
to
this
turpitude
certainly
not
they
think
it
the
real
thing
the
whole
business
hangs
on
that
and
as
the
sheriff
or
whoever
it
is
in
the
fool
plot
captures
the
bandits
the
party
gets
its
money
back
and
has
material
for
conversation
for
the
next
twenty
years
to
think
said
tish
of
our
great
national
government
lending
itself
to
such
a
scheme
wrong
said
the
young
man
it
a
combination
of
western
railroads
and
a
movie
concern
acting
together
i
trust
tish
observed
setting
her
lips
firmly
that
the
tourists
will
protest
the
more
noise
the
better
the
young
man
though
not
more
cheerful
as
to
appearance
was
certainly
more
talkative
trust
a
clergyman
for
yelling
when
his
pocket
picked
with
one
voice
the
three
of
us
exclaimed
mr
ostermaier
he
was
not
sure
of
the
name
but
helen
had
pointed
the
clergyman
out
to
him
and
it
was
ostermaier
without
a
doubt
we
talked
it
over
with
bill
when
we
got
back
and
he
was
not
as
surprised
as
we
expected
knew
they
were
cooking
up
something
they
got
some
indians
in
it
too
saw
them
rehearsing
old
thunder
mountain
the
other
day
in
nothing
but
a
tish
reproved
him
for
a
lack
of
delicacy
of
speech
and
shortly
afterward
we
went
to
bed
owing
to
the
root
under
the
tent
and
puddles
here
and
there
we
could
not
go
to
sleep
for
a
time
and
we
discussed
the
nefarious
deed
as
tish
aptly
termed
it
that
was
about
to
take
place
although
tish
observed
ostermaier
has
been
receiving
for
so
many
years
that
it
might
be
a
good
thing
for
his
soul
sake
to
have
him
give
up
something
even
if
to
bandits
i
dozed
off
after
a
time
but
awakened
to
find
tish
sitting
up
wide
awake
i
been
thinking
that
thing
over
lizzie
she
said
in
a
low
tone
i
believe
it
our
duty
to
interfere
of
course
i
replied
sarcastically
and
be
shown
all
over
the
country
in
the
movies
making
fools
of
ourselves
did
you
notice
that
that
young
man
said
they
would
be
firing
blank
cartridges
well
even
a
blank
cartridge
can
be
a
dangerous
thing
then
and
there
i
reminded
her
of
my
niece
boy
who
was
struck
on
the
fourth
of
july
by
a
wad
from
one
and
had
to
be
watched
for
lockjaw
for
several
weeks
it
was
at
that
moment
that
we
heard
bill
who
had
no
tent
by
choice
and
lay
under
a
tree
give
a
loud
whoop
followed
by
what
was
unmistakably
an
oath
bear
he
yelled
watch
out
he
headed
for
the
tent
it
a
grizzly
tish
felt
round
wildly
for
her
revolver
but
it
was
gone
and
the
bear
was
close
by
we
could
hear
it
snuffing
about
and
to
add
to
the
confusion
aggie
wakened
and
commenced
to
sneeze
with
terror
bill
tish
called
i
lost
my
revolver
i
took
it
miss
carberry
but
i
been
lying
in
a
puddle
and
it
go
off
all
hope
seemed
gone
the
frail
walls
of
our
tent
were
no
protection
whatever
and
as
we
all
knew
even
a
tree
was
no
refuge
from
a
bear
which
as
we
had
seen
in
the
zoological
garden
at
home
can
climb
like
a
cat
only
swifter
besides
none
of
us
could
climb
a
tree
it
was
at
that
moment
that
tish
had
one
of
those
inspirations
that
make
her
so
dependable
in
emergencies
feeling
round
in
the
tent
for
a
possible
weapon
she
touched
a
large
ham
from
which
we
had
broiled
a
few
slices
at
supper
in
her
shadowy
form
there
was
both
purpose
and
high
courage
with
a
single
sweeping
gesture
she
flung
the
ham
at
the
bear
so
accurately
that
we
heard
the
thud
with
which
it
struck
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
bill
called
from
a
safe
distance
even
then
we
realized
that
his
restraint
of
speech
was
a
pose
pure
and
simple
if
you
make
him
angry
he
tear
up
the
whole
place
but
tish
did
not
deign
to
answer
the
rain
had
ceased
and
suddenly
the
moon
came
out
and
illuminated
the
whole
scene
we
saw
the
bear
sniffing
at
the
ham
which
lay
on
the
ground
then
he
picked
it
up
in
his
jaws
and
stood
looking
about
tish
said
later
that
the
moment
his
teeth
were
buried
in
the
ham
she
felt
safe
i
can
still
see
the
majestic
movement
with
which
she
walked
out
of
the
tent
and
waved
her
arms
now
scat
with
you
she
said
firmly
scat
he
scatted
snarling
through
his
nose
for
fear
of
dropping
the
ham
he
turned
and
fled
up
the
mountainside
in
the
open
space
tish
stood
the
conqueror
she
yawned
and
glanced
about
going
to
be
a
nice
night
after
all
she
said
now
bill
bring
me
that
revolver
and
if
i
catch
you
meddling
with
it
again
i
put
that
pair
of
fur
rugs
you
are
so
proud
of
in
the
fire
bill
who
was
ignorant
of
the
ham
emerged
sheepishly
into
the
open
where
the
where
the
dickens
did
you
hit
him
miss
tish
he
asked
in
the
stomach
tish
replied
tartly
and
taking
her
revolver
went
back
to
the
tent
all
the
next
day
tish
was
quiet
she
rode
ahead
hardly
noticing
the
scenery
with
her
head
dropped
on
her
chest
at
luncheon
she
took
a
sardine
sandwich
and
withdrew
to
a
tree
underneath
which
she
sat
a
lonely
and
brooding
figure
when
luncheon
was
over
and
aggie
and
i
were
washing
the
dishes
and
hanging
out
the
dish
towels
to
dry
on
a
bush
tish
approached
bill
who
was
pouring
water
on
the
fire
to
extinguish
it
bill
she
stated
you
came
to
us
under
false
pretenses
you
swear
for
one
thing
only
under
excitement
miss
tish
he
said
and
as
far
as
that
goes
miss
aggie
herself
said
also
tish
went
on
hastily
you
said
you
could
cook
you
can
not
cook
now
look
here
miss
tish
he
said
in
a
pleading
tone
i
can
cook
i
did
claim
to
know
the
whole
cookbook
i
can
make
coffee
and
fry
bacon
how
i
know
you
ladies
wanted
pastry
as
for
them
canned
salmon
croquettes
with
white
sauce
i
reckon
to
make
them
with
a
little
showing
and
also
said
tish
cutting
in
sternly
you
took
away
my
revolver
and
left
us
helpless
last
night
and
in
peril
of
wild
beasts
tourists
ai
allowed
to
carry
guns
he
attempted
to
look
injured
but
tish
ignored
him
therefore
she
said
if
i
am
not
to
send
you
back
which
i
have
been
considering
all
day
as
i
put
up
a
tent
myself
before
this
and
you
are
only
an
extra
mouth
to
feed
which
as
we
are
one
ham
short
is
inconvenient
you
will
have
to
justify
my
keeping
you
if
you
will
just
show
me
once
about
them
gems
miss
tish
he
began
but
tish
cut
him
off
no
she
said
firmly
you
are
too
casual
about
cooking
and
you
are
no
setting
a
plate
in
a
river
and
letting
the
current
wash
it
may
satisfy
it
does
go
with
me
the
point
is
this
you
know
all
about
the
holdup
that
is
going
to
take
place
do
lie
i
know
you
know
now
you
take
us
there
and
tell
us
all
you
know
about
it
he
scratched
his
head
reflectively
i
tell
you
he
said
i
a
slow
thinker
give
me
about
twenty
minutes
on
it
will
you
it
a
sort
of
secret
and
there
different
ways
of
looking
at
it
tish
took
out
her
watch
twenty
minutes
she
said
start
thinking
now
he
wandered
off
and
rolled
a
cigarette
later
on
as
i
have
said
he
showed
tish
how
to
do
it
not
of
course
that
she
meant
to
smoke
but
tish
is
fond
of
learning
how
to
do
things
she
got
so
she
could
roll
them
with
one
hand
and
she
does
it
now
in
the
winter
evenings
instead
of
rolling
paper
spills
as
formerly
when
charlie
sands
comes
she
always
has
a
supply
ready
for
him
although
occasionally
somewhat
dry
from
waiting
for
a
few
weeks
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
tish
snapped
her
watch
shut
time
she
called
and
bill
came
back
well
i
do
it
he
said
i
do
know
as
they
put
you
in
the
picture
but
i
see
what
i
can
do
picture
nothing
tish
snapped
you
take
us
there
and
hide
us
the
point
there
must
be
caves
round
to
put
us
in
although
i
insist
on
a
cave
they
damp
usually
well
he
looked
puzzled
but
he
agreed
i
caught
aggie
eye
and
we
exchanged
glances
there
was
trouble
coming
and
we
knew
it
our
long
experience
with
tish
had
taught
us
not
to
ask
questions
ours
but
to
do
and
die
as
aggie
later
said
but
i
confess
to
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
during
the
remainder
of
that
day
we
changed
our
course
that
afternoon
turning
off
at
saint
mary
and
spending
the
night
near
the
swiss
chalet
at
aggie
and
i
pleaded
to
spend
the
night
in
the
chalet
but
tish
was
adamant
when
i
am
out
camping
i
camp
she
said
i
can
have
a
bed
at
home
but
i
can
not
sleep
under
the
stars
on
a
bed
of
pine
needles
and
be
lured
to
rest
by
the
murmur
of
a
mountain
stream
well
we
gave
it
up
and
went
with
her
i
must
say
that
the
trip
had
improved
us
already
except
when
terrified
or
kicked
by
a
horse
aggie
was
not
sneezing
at
all
and
i
could
now
climb
into
the
saddle
unassisted
my
waistbands
were
much
looser
too
and
during
a
short
rest
that
afternoon
i
put
a
dart
in
my
during
the
absence
of
bill
after
the
which
had
strayed
it
was
on
that
occasion
that
tish
told
us
as
much
of
her
plan
as
she
thought
it
wise
for
us
to
know
the
holdup
she
explained
is
to
be
the
day
after
on
the
piegan
pass
bill
says
there
is
a
level
spot
at
the
top
with
rocks
all
about
that
is
the
spot
the
ostermaiers
and
their
party
leave
the
automobiles
at
many
glaciers
and
take
horses
to
the
pass
it
will
be
worth
coming
clear
to
montana
to
see
ostermaier
on
a
horse
i
still
do
see
aggie
observed
in
a
quavering
voice
what
we
have
to
do
with
it
naturally
not
said
tish
you
know
as
soon
as
is
good
for
you
i
do
believe
it
will
ever
be
good
for
me
said
poor
aggie
it
is
good
for
anybody
to
be
near
a
holdup
and
i
do
want
to
be
in
a
moving
picture
with
no
teeth
i
not
a
vain
woman
she
said
but
i
draw
the
line
at
that
but
tish
ignored
her
the
only
trouble
she
said
is
having
one
revolver
if
we
each
had
one
lizzie
did
you
bring
any
ink
well
i
had
and
said
so
but
that
i
needed
it
for
postcards
when
we
struck
a
settlement
tish
waved
my
objection
aside
i
guess
it
can
be
managed
she
observed
bill
has
a
knife
yes
i
think
it
can
be
done
she
and
bill
engaged
in
an
earnest
conference
that
afternoon
at
first
bill
objected
i
could
see
him
shaking
his
head
then
tish
gave
him
something
which
aggie
said
was
money
i
do
not
know
she
had
been
short
of
cash
on
the
train
but
she
may
have
had
more
in
her
trunk
then
i
saw
bill
start
to
laugh
he
laughed
until
he
had
to
lean
against
a
tree
although
tish
was
quite
stern
and
serious
we
reached
piegan
pass
about
three
that
afternoon
and
having
inspected
it
and
the
garden
wall
which
is
a
mile
or
two
high
at
that
point
we
returned
to
a
bench
where
there
were
some
trees
and
dismounted
here
to
our
surprise
we
found
bell
again
as
tish
remarked
he
was
better
at
walking
than
at
talking
he
looked
surprised
at
seeing
us
and
was
much
more
agreeable
than
before
i
afraid
i
was
pretty
surly
the
other
night
he
said
the
truth
is
i
was
so
blooming
unhappy
that
i
did
give
a
damn
for
anything
but
when
he
saw
that
bill
was
preparing
to
take
the
pack
off
the
horse
he
looked
startled
i
say
he
said
you
do
mean
to
camp
here
do
you
such
is
my
intention
tish
observed
grimly
but
look
here
just
beyond
at
the
pass
is
where
the
holdup
is
to
take
place
so
i
believe
said
tish
what
has
that
to
do
with
us
what
are
you
going
to
do
oh
i
going
to
hang
round
well
we
intend
to
hang
round
also
he
stood
by
and
watched
our
preparations
for
camp
tish
chose
a
small
grove
for
the
tent
and
then
left
us
clambering
up
the
she
finally
disappeared
aggie
mixed
some
muffins
for
tea
and
we
invited
the
young
man
to
join
us
but
he
was
looking
downhearted
again
and
refused
however
when
she
took
them
out
of
the
portable
oven
nicely
browned
and
lifting
the
tops
of
each
one
dropped
in
a
teaspoonful
of
grape
jelly
he
changed
his
mind
i
stay
if
you
do
mind
he
said
maybe
some
decent
food
will
make
me
see
things
clearer
when
tish
descended
at
six
she
looked
depressed
there
is
no
cave
she
said
although
i
have
gone
where
a
mountain
goat
would
get
dizzy
but
i
have
found
a
good
place
to
hide
the
horses
where
we
can
get
them
quickly
when
we
need
them
aggie
was
scooping
the
inside
out
of
her
muffin
being
unable
to
eat
the
crust
but
she
went
quite
pale
tish
she
said
you
have
some
desperate
plan
in
view
and
i
am
not
equal
to
it
i
am
worn
with
travel
and
soft
food
and
am
not
as
young
as
i
once
was
desperate
nothing
said
tish
pouring
condensed
milk
into
her
tea
i
am
going
to
teach
a
lot
of
idiots
a
lesson
that
all
there
should
be
one
spot
in
america
free
from
the
advertising
man
and
his
schemes
and
this
is
going
to
be
it
commercialism
she
went
on
growing
oratorical
does
not
belong
here
among
these
mighty
mountains
once
let
it
start
and
these
towering
cliffs
will
be
defaced
with
toothpowder
and
signs
the
young
man
knew
the
plans
for
the
holdup
even
letter
than
bill
he
was
able
to
show
us
the
exact
spot
which
had
been
selected
and
to
tell
us
the
hour
at
which
the
ostermaier
party
was
to
cross
the
pass
they
lunch
on
the
pass
he
said
and
of
course
they
suspect
nothing
the
young
lady
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
will
be
one
of
their
party
she
however
knows
what
is
coming
and
is
indeed
a
party
to
it
the
holdup
will
take
place
during
luncheon
here
his
voice
broke
and
he
ate
an
entire
muffin
before
he
went
on
the
holdup
will
take
place
on
the
pass
the
bandits
having
been
hidden
on
this
right
here
then
the
outlaws
having
robbed
the
tourists
will
steal
the
young
lady
and
escape
down
the
trail
on
the
other
side
the
guide
who
is
in
the
plot
will
ride
ahead
in
this
direction
and
raise
the
alarm
you
understand
he
added
that
as
a
job
the
tourists
will
get
all
their
stuff
back
i
do
know
how
that
to
be
arranged
but
the
girl
tish
asked
she
to
make
her
escape
later
bell
said
grimly
and
will
be
photographed
galloping
down
the
trail
by
another
idiot
with
a
camera
who
of
course
just
happens
to
be
on
the
spot
she
do
it
too
he
added
with
a
pathetic
note
of
pride
in
his
voice
she
got
nerve
enough
for
anything
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
aggie
poured
him
a
third
cup
of
tea
i
dare
say
this
will
finish
everything
he
said
dejectedly
i
offer
her
any
excitement
like
this
we
live
in
a
quiet
suburb
where
nobody
ever
fires
a
revolver
except
on
the
fourth
of
july
what
she
needs
tish
said
bending
forward
is
a
lesson
bell
something
to
make
her
hate
the
very
thought
of
a
moving
picture
and
shudder
at
the
sound
of
a
shot
exactly
said
bell
i
thought
of
that
something
to
make
her
and
it
curious
about
her
in
some
ways
she
a
timid
girl
she
afraid
of
thunder
for
one
thing
tish
bent
forward
do
you
know
she
said
the
greatest
weapon
in
the
world
weapon
well
i
do
know
these
new
german
guns
the
greatest
weapon
in
the
world
tish
explained
is
ridicule
man
is
helpless
against
it
to
be
absurd
is
to
be
lost
when
the
bandits
take
the
money
where
do
they
go
down
the
other
side
from
the
pass
a
photographer
will
photograph
them
there
making
their
escape
with
the
loot
and
the
young
lady
i
told
you
that
he
said
bitterly
she
is
to
be
captured
by
the
attacking
party
they
will
all
be
armed
sure
with
blanks
the
indians
have
guns
and
arrows
but
the
arrows
have
rubber
tips
tish
rose
majestically
bell
she
said
you
may
sleep
the
sleep
of
peace
when
i
undertake
a
thing
i
carry
it
through
my
friends
will
agree
with
me
i
never
fail
when
my
heart
is
set
on
it
by
the
day
after
the
young
lady
in
the
case
will
hate
the
sight
of
a
camera
although
not
disclosing
her
plan
she
invited
the
young
man
to
join
us
but
his
face
fell
and
he
shook
his
head
tish
said
that
she
did
not
expect
to
need
him
but
that
if
the
time
came
she
would
blow
three
times
on
a
police
whistle
which
she
had
with
her
usual
foresight
brought
along
he
agreed
to
that
although
looking
rather
surprised
and
we
parted
from
him
i
would
advise
tish
said
as
he
moved
away
that
you
conceal
yourself
in
the
valley
below
the
pass
on
the
other
side
he
agreed
to
this
and
we
separated
for
the
night
but
long
after
aggie
and
i
had
composed
ourselves
to
rest
tish
sat
on
a
stone
by
the
and
rolled
cigarettes
at
last
she
came
into
the
tent
and
wakened
us
by
prodding
us
with
her
foot
get
all
the
sleep
you
can
she
said
we
leave
here
at
dawn
and
there
be
little
rest
for
any
of
us
night
at
daylight
next
morning
she
roused
us
she
was
dressed
except
that
she
wore
her
and
her
hair
was
loose
round
her
face
aggie
you
make
an
omelet
in
a
hurry
and
lizzie
you
will
have
to
get
the
horses
i
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
said
sitting
up
on
the
ground
got
a
man
here
for
that
besides
i
have
to
set
the
table
very
well
tish
replied
we
can
stay
here
i
dare
say
bill
busy
at
something
i
set
him
to
doing
whose
fault
is
it
i
demanded
that
we
are
here
in
icy
mountains
not
mine
id
never
heard
of
the
dratted
place
and
those
horses
are
five
miles
away
by
now
most
likely
go
and
get
a
cup
of
tea
you
have
a
little
sense
then
said
tish
not
unkindly
and
as
for
what
bill
doing
he
making
revolvers
where
your
writing
ink
had
none
i
realized
it
that
moment
i
had
got
it
out
at
the
first
camp
to
record
in
my
diary
the
place
weather
temperature
and
my
own
pulse
rate
which
i
had
been
advised
to
watch
on
account
of
the
effect
of
altitude
on
the
heart
and
had
left
the
bottle
sitting
on
a
stone
when
i
confessed
this
to
tish
she
was
unjustly
angry
and
a
trifle
bitter
it
what
i
deserve
most
likely
for
bringing
along
two
incompetents
was
her
brief
remark
without
ink
we
are
weaponless
but
she
is
a
creature
of
resource
and
a
moment
later
she
emerged
from
the
tent
and
called
to
bill
in
a
cheerful
tone
no
ink
bill
she
said
but
we
got
blackberry
cordial
and
by
mixing
it
with
a
little
soot
we
may
be
able
to
manage
aggie
demurred
loudly
as
there
are
occasions
when
only
a
mouthful
of
the
cordial
enables
her
to
keep
doing
but
tish
was
firm
when
i
went
to
the
fire
i
found
bill
busily
carving
wooden
revolvers
copying
tish
which
lay
before
him
he
had
them
done
well
enough
and
could
have
gone
for
the
horses
as
easy
as
not
but
he
insisted
on
trimming
them
up
mine
which
i
still
have
has
a
buffalo
head
carved
on
the
handle
and
aggie
has
a
wreath
of
leaves
running
round
the
barrel
in
spite
of
aggie
wails
tish
poured
a
large
part
of
the
blackberry
cordial
into
a
biscuit
pan
and
put
in
a
chip
of
wood
it
makes
it
red
she
said
doubtfully
i
never
saw
a
red
revolver
bill
seems
like
an
awful
waste
bill
said
but
having
now
completed
the
wreath
he
placed
all
three
weapons
he
had
made
one
for
himself
in
the
pan
the
last
thing
i
saw
as
i
started
for
the
horses
was
the
three
of
them
standing
about
looking
down
and
aggie
face
was
full
of
misery
i
was
gone
for
a
the
horses
had
not
wandered
far
and
having
mounted
mine
although
without
a
saddle
i
copied
as
well
as
i
could
the
whoop
bill
used
to
drive
them
in
and
rounded
them
up
when
i
returned
driving
them
before
me
the
pack
was
ready
and
on
tish
face
was
a
look
of
intense
satisfaction
i
soon
perceived
the
reason
lying
on
a
stone
by
the
fire
were
three
of
the
shiniest
black
revolvers
any
one
could
want
i
eyed
tish
and
she
explained
stove
polish
she
said
like
a
fool
i
forgot
it
gives
a
true
metallic
luster
as
it
says
on
the
box
tish
is
very
particular
about
a
stove
and
even
on
our
we
keep
the
portable
stove
shining
and
clean
does
it
come
off
well
more
or
less
she
admitted
we
can
keep
the
box
out
and
renew
when
necessary
it
is
a
great
comfort
she
added
to
feel
that
we
are
all
armed
we
shall
need
weapons
in
an
emergency
i
observed
rather
tartly
i
hope
you
will
not
depend
on
us
too
much
while
i
do
know
what
you
intend
to
do
if
it
is
anything
desperate
just
remember
that
the
only
way
aggie
or
i
can
do
any
damage
with
these
things
is
to
thrust
them
down
somebody
throat
and
strangle
him
to
death
she
ignored
my
remark
however
and
soon
we
were
on
our
horses
and
moving
along
the
trail
toward
the
pass
ii
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
remind
those
familiar
with
glacier
park
of
the
trail
which
hugs
the
mountain
above
and
extends
toward
the
pass
for
a
mile
or
so
in
a
long
semicircle
which
curves
inward
at
the
end
it
turns
to
the
right
and
mounts
to
an
acre
or
so
of
level
ground
with
snow
and
rocks
but
no
vegetation
this
is
the
piegan
pass
behind
it
is
the
garden
wall
that
stupendous
mass
of
granite
rising
to
incredible
heights
on
the
other
side
the
trail
drops
abruptly
by
means
of
stepladders
which
i
have
explained
tish
now
told
us
of
her
plan
the
unfortunate
part
is
she
said
that
the
ostermaiers
will
not
see
us
i
tried
to
arrange
it
so
they
could
but
it
was
impossible
we
must
content
ourselves
with
the
knowledge
of
a
good
deed
done
her
plan
in
brief
was
this
the
sham
attacking
party
was
to
turn
and
ride
away
down
the
far
side
of
the
pass
up
which
the
ostermaiers
had
come
they
were
according
to
the
young
man
to
take
the
girl
with
them
with
the
idea
of
holding
her
for
ransom
she
was
to
escape
however
while
they
were
lunching
in
some
secluded
fastness
and
riding
back
to
the
pass
was
to
meet
there
a
rescue
party
which
the
ostermaiers
were
to
meet
on
the
way
down
to
gunsight
chalet
tish
idea
was
this
we
would
ride
up
while
they
were
lunching
pretend
to
think
them
real
bandits
paying
no
attention
to
them
if
they
fired
at
us
as
we
knew
they
had
only
blank
cartridges
and
having
taken
them
prisoners
make
them
walk
in
ignominy
to
the
nearest
camp
some
miles
farther
then
said
tish
either
they
will
confess
the
ruse
and
the
country
will
ring
with
laughter
or
they
will
have
to
submit
to
arrest
and
much
unpleasantness
it
will
be
a
severe
lesson
we
reached
the
pass
safely
and
on
the
way
down
the
other
side
we
passed
oliver
the
man
with
his
outfit
on
a
horse
he
touched
his
hat
politely
and
moved
out
on
a
ledge
to
let
us
by
mind
if
i
take
you
as
you
go
down
the
mountain
he
called
it
a
bully
place
for
a
picture
he
stared
at
aggie
who
was
muffled
in
a
cape
and
had
the
dish
towel
round
her
head
i
particularly
like
to
get
your
arab
he
said
the
far
east
and
the
far
west
you
know
aggie
gave
him
a
furious
glance
arab
nothing
she
snapped
if
you
ca
tell
a
christian
lady
from
a
heathen
on
account
of
her
having
lost
her
hat
then
you
belong
in
the
dirty
work
you
doing
aggie
be
quiet
tish
said
in
an
awful
voice
but
wrath
had
made
aggie
reckless
work
was
what
i
said
she
repeated
staring
at
the
young
man
i
beg
your
pardon
i
sure
i
do
think
aggie
went
on
to
tish
fury
that
we
do
know
a
few
things
we
do
i
see
he
said
slowly
all
right
although
i
like
to
know
said
aggie
and
kicked
her
horse
to
go
on
i
shall
never
forget
tish
face
round
the
next
bend
she
got
off
her
horse
and
confronted
aggie
illustration
the
older
i
get
aggie
pilkington
the
more
i
realize
that
to
take
you
anywhere
means
ruin
the
older
i
get
aggie
pilkington
she
said
the
more
i
realize
that
to
take
you
anywhere
means
ruin
we
are
done
now
all
our
labor
is
for
nothing
there
will
be
no
holdup
no
nothing
they
are
scared
off
but
aggie
was
still
angry
just
let
some
one
take
you
for
a
lousy
bedouin
tish
she
said
and
see
what
you
would
do
i
not
sorry
anyhow
i
never
did
like
the
idea
but
tish
dislikes
relinquishing
an
idea
once
it
has
taken
hold
and
although
she
did
not
speak
to
aggie
again
for
the
next
hour
she
went
ahead
with
her
preparations
there
still
a
chance
lizzie
she
said
it
not
likely
give
up
easy
on
account
of
hiring
the
indians
and
everything
about
a
mile
and
a
half
down
the
trail
she
picked
out
a
place
to
hide
this
time
there
was
a
cave
we
cleared
our
saddles
for
action
as
tish
proposed
to
let
them
escape
past
us
with
the
girl
and
then
to
follow
them
rapidly
stealing
upon
them
if
possible
while
they
were
at
luncheon
and
covering
them
with
the
one
real
revolver
and
the
three
wooden
ones
the
only
thing
that
bothered
us
was
bill
attitude
he
kept
laughing
to
himself
and
muttering
and
when
he
was
storing
things
in
the
cave
tish
took
me
aside
i
do
like
his
attitude
lizzie
she
said
he
likely
to
giggle
or
do
something
silly
just
at
the
crucial
moment
i
can
not
understand
why
he
thinks
it
is
funny
but
he
does
we
be
much
better
without
him
you
better
talk
to
him
tish
i
said
you
ca
get
rid
of
him
now
but
to
tell
tish
she
can
not
do
a
thing
is
to
determine
her
to
do
it
it
was
still
early
only
eight
when
she
came
to
me
with
an
eager
face
i
got
it
lizzie
she
said
i
send
off
mona
lisa
and
he
will
have
to
search
for
her
the
only
thing
is
she
wo
move
unless
driven
if
we
could
only
find
a
hornet
nest
again
we
could
manage
it
may
be
cruel
but
i
understand
that
a
hornet
sting
is
not
as
painful
to
a
horse
as
to
a
human
being
mona
lisa
i
must
explain
was
the
tish
had
changed
her
name
from
jane
to
mona
lisa
because
in
the
mornings
she
was
constantly
missing
and
having
to
be
looked
for
tish
disappeared
for
a
time
and
we
settled
down
to
our
long
wait
bill
put
another
coat
of
stove
polish
on
the
weapons
and
broke
now
and
then
into
silent
laughter
on
my
giving
him
a
haughty
glance
however
he
became
sober
and
rubbed
with
redoubled
vigor
in
a
however
i
saw
tish
beckoning
to
me
from
a
distance
and
i
went
to
her
i
soon
saw
that
she
was
holding
her
handkerchief
to
one
cheek
but
when
i
mentioned
the
fact
she
ignored
me
i
have
found
a
nest
lizzie
she
cried
slip
over
and
unfasten
mona
lisa
she
not
near
the
other
horses
which
is
fortunate
i
then
perceived
that
tish
yellow
slicker
was
behind
her
on
the
ground
and
tied
into
a
bundle
from
which
emerged
a
dull
roaring
i
was
wondering
how
tish
expected
to
open
it
when
she
settled
the
question
by
asking
me
to
cut
a
piece
from
the
mosquito
netting
which
we
put
in
the
doorway
of
the
tent
at
night
and
to
bring
her
aggie
was
darning
a
hole
in
the
tablecloth
when
i
went
back
and
bill
was
still
engaged
with
the
weapons
having
taken
what
she
required
to
tish
under
pretense
of
giving
mona
lisa
a
lump
of
sugar
i
untied
her
what
followed
was
exactly
as
tish
had
planned
mona
lisa
not
realizing
her
freedom
stood
still
while
tish
untied
the
slicker
and
freed
its
furious
inmates
she
then
dropped
the
whole
thing
under
the
unfortunate
animal
and
retreated
not
too
rapidly
for
fear
of
drawing
bill
attention
for
possibly
sixty
seconds
nothing
happened
except
that
mona
lisa
raised
her
head
and
appeared
to
listen
then
with
a
loud
scream
she
threw
up
her
head
and
bolted
by
the
time
bill
had
put
down
the
stove
brush
she
was
out
of
sight
among
the
trees
but
we
could
hear
her
leaping
and
scrambling
through
the
wood
jumping
cats
said
bill
and
ran
for
his
horse
acts
as
though
started
for
the
coast
he
yelled
to
me
and
flung
after
her
when
he
had
disappeared
tish
came
out
of
the
woods
and
getting
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
poured
it
over
the
nest
in
spite
of
the
netting
however
she
was
stung
again
on
the
back
of
the
neck
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
holding
wet
mud
to
the
affected
parts
her
brain
however
was
as
active
as
ever
and
by
eleven
mounting
a
boulder
she
announced
that
she
could
see
the
ostermaier
party
far
down
the
trail
and
that
in
an
hour
they
would
probably
be
at
the
top
she
had
her
and
she
said
that
ostermaier
was
pointing
up
to
the
pass
and
shaking
her
head
and
that
the
others
were
arguing
with
her
illustration
it
would
be
just
like
the
woman
to
refuse
to
come
any
farther
and
spoil
everything
it
would
be
just
like
the
woman
tish
said
bitterly
to
refuse
to
come
any
farther
and
spoil
everything
but
a
little
later
she
announced
that
the
guide
was
leading
ostermaier
horse
and
that
they
were
coming
on
we
immediately
retreated
to
the
cave
and
waited
it
being
intention
to
allow
them
to
reach
the
pass
without
suspecting
our
presence
and
only
to
cut
off
the
in
their
retreat
as
i
have
explained
it
was
well
that
we
had
concealed
the
horses
also
for
the
party
stopped
near
the
cave
and
ostermaier
was
weeping
not
a
step
farther
she
said
i
have
a
family
to
consider
and
ostermaier
is
a
man
of
wide
usefulness
and
can
not
be
spared
we
did
not
dare
to
look
out
but
we
heard
the
young
lady
speaking
and
as
aggie
remarked
later
no
one
would
have
thought
from
the
sweetness
of
her
voice
that
she
was
a
creature
of
duplicity
but
it
is
perfectly
safe
dear
ostermaier
she
said
and
think
when
you
go
home
of
being
able
to
say
that
you
have
climbed
a
mountain
pass
pass
sniffed
ostermaier
pass
nothing
i
do
call
a
wall
a
mile
high
a
pass
think
said
the
girl
of
being
able
to
crow
over
those
three
old
women
who
are
always
boasting
of
the
things
they
do
probably
you
are
right
and
they
never
do
them
at
all
but
you
there
a
man
waiting
remember
and
you
can
show
the
picture
before
the
dorcas
society
no
one
can
ever
doubt
that
you
have
done
a
courageous
thing
you
have
the
proof
george
said
ostermaier
in
a
small
voice
if
anything
happens
i
have
told
you
how
i
want
my
things
divided
little
devil
whispered
aggie
referring
to
the
girl
if
that
young
man
knows
when
he
is
well
off
he
let
her
go
but
beyond
rebuking
her
for
the
epithet
tish
made
no
comment
and
the
party
moved
on
we
lost
them
for
a
time
among
the
trees
but
when
they
moved
out
above
we
were
able
to
watch
them
and
we
saw
that
ostermaier
got
off
her
horse
about
halfway
up
and
climbed
slowly
on
foot
tish
who
had
the
glasses
said
that
she
looked
purple
and
angry
and
that
she
distinctly
saw
the
guide
give
her
something
to
drink
out
of
a
bottle
it
might
however
have
been
vichy
or
some
similar
innocent
beverage
and
i
believe
in
giving
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
when
at
last
they
vanished
over
the
edge
of
the
pass
we
led
out
our
horses
and
prepared
for
what
was
to
come
bill
had
not
returned
and
indeed
we
did
not
see
him
until
the
evening
of
the
second
day
after
that
when
worn
but
triumphant
we
emerged
from
the
trail
at
the
many
glaciers
hotel
that
however
comes
later
in
this
narrative
with
everything
prepared
tish
judged
it
best
to
have
luncheon
i
made
a
few
sandwiches
beating
the
mayonnaise
in
the
cool
recesses
of
the
cave
and
we
drank
some
iced
tea
to
which
aggie
had
thoughtfully
added
sliced
lemon
and
a
quantity
of
ginger
ale
feeling
much
refreshed
we
grasped
our
weapons
and
waited
at
twelve
we
heard
a
loud
shriek
on
the
pass
far
overhead
followed
almost
immediately
by
a
fusillade
of
shots
then
a
silence
followed
by
more
shots
then
a
solitary
horseman
rode
over
the
edge
of
the
pass
and
spurring
his
horse
rode
recklessly
down
the
precipitous
trail
aggie
exclaimed
that
it
was
ostermaier
basely
deserting
his
wife
in
her
apparent
hour
of
need
but
tish
who
had
the
glasses
reported
finally
that
it
was
the
man
we
were
greatly
surprised
as
it
had
not
occurred
to
us
that
this
would
be
a
part
of
the
program
as
he
descended
tish
announced
that
there
must
be
another
photographer
on
top
as
he
was
registering
signs
of
terror
a
expression
which
she
had
acquired
from
charlie
sands
and
looking
back
frequently
over
his
shoulder
we
waited
until
he
reached
and
then
withdrew
to
a
group
of
trees
it
was
not
our
intention
to
allow
him
to
see
us
and
spoil
everything
but
when
he
came
near
through
the
woods
and
his
horse
continued
at
unabated
speed
tish
decided
that
the
animal
frightened
by
the
shots
was
running
away
she
therefore
placed
herself
across
the
trail
to
check
its
headlong
speed
but
the
animal
merely
rushed
round
her
oliver
yelled
something
at
us
which
we
were
however
unable
to
hear
and
kept
madly
on
almost
immediately
four
men
firing
back
over
their
shoulders
rode
into
sight
at
the
pass
and
came
swiftly
down
toward
us
where
the
girl
tish
cried
with
her
glasses
to
her
eyes
the
idiots
have
got
excited
and
have
forgotten
to
steal
her
that
was
plainly
what
had
happened
but
she
was
determined
to
be
stolen
anyhow
for
the
next
moment
she
rode
into
view
furiously
following
the
bandits
she
kept
her
head
anyhow
tish
observed
with
satisfaction
trust
a
lot
of
men
to
go
crazy
and
do
the
wrong
thing
but
they
have
to
change
the
story
and
make
her
follow
them
at
the
men
seemed
to
realize
that
she
was
behind
them
and
they
turned
and
looked
up
they
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
in
view
of
the
picture
but
they
were
quick
thinkers
too
we
decided
right
then
and
there
they
took
her
prisoner
surrounding
her
she
made
a
desperate
resistance
even
crying
out
as
we
could
plainly
see
but
tish
was
irritated
she
said
she
could
not
see
how
the
story
would
hold
now
either
the
girl
should
have
captured
them
they
being
out
of
ammunition
or
the
whole
thing
should
have
been
done
again
according
to
the
original
plan
however
as
she
said
it
was
not
our
affair
our
business
was
to
teach
them
a
lesson
not
to
impose
on
unsuspecting
tourists
for
although
not
fond
of
ostermaier
we
had
been
members
of
ostermaier
church
and
liked
him
although
his
sermons
were
shorter
than
tish
entirely
approved
of
we
withdrew
again
to
seclusion
until
they
had
passed
and
tish
gave
them
ten
minutes
to
get
well
ahead
then
we
rode
out
tish
face
was
stern
as
she
led
off
the
shriek
of
ostermaier
was
still
as
she
said
in
a
low
tone
ringing
in
her
ears
but
before
we
had
gone
very
far
tish
stopped
and
got
off
her
horse
we
got
to
pad
the
horses
feet
she
said
how
can
we
creep
up
on
them
when
on
every
stony
place
we
sound
like
an
artillery
engagement
here
was
a
difficulty
we
had
not
anticipated
but
tish
overcame
it
with
her
customary
resource
by
taking
the
blanket
from
under
her
saddle
and
cutting
it
into
pieces
with
her
scissors
which
always
accompany
her
we
then
cut
the
leather
straps
from
our
saddles
at
her
direction
and
each
of
us
went
to
work
aggie
however
protested
i
never
expected
she
said
querulously
to
be
sitting
on
the
rocky
mountains
under
a
horse
tying
a
piece
of
bed
quilt
on
his
feet
i
would
mind
she
added
if
the
creature
liked
me
but
the
way
he
feels
toward
me
he
likely
to
haul
off
and
murder
me
at
any
moment
however
it
was
done
at
last
and
it
made
a
great
change
we
moved
along
silently
and
all
went
well
except
that
having
neglected
to
draw
the
cinch
tight
and
the
horse
back
being
slippery
without
the
padding
my
saddle
turned
unexpectedly
throwing
me
off
into
the
trail
i
bruised
my
arm
badly
but
tish
only
gave
me
a
glance
of
scorn
and
went
on
being
above
carelessness
herself
she
very
justly
resents
it
in
others
we
had
expected
with
reason
that
the
highwaymen
having
retreated
to
a
certain
distance
would
there
pause
and
very
possibly
lunch
before
returning
it
was
therefore
a
matter
of
surprise
to
find
that
they
had
kept
on
moreover
they
seemed
to
have
advanced
rapidly
and
tish
who
had
read
a
book
on
signs
of
the
trail
examined
the
hoofprints
of
their
horses
in
a
soft
place
beside
a
stream
and
reported
that
they
had
been
going
at
a
lope
now
remember
she
said
as
she
prepared
to
mount
again
to
all
intents
and
purposes
these
are
real
bandits
and
to
be
treated
accordingly
our
motto
is
quarter
i
shall
be
harsh
and
i
expect
no
protest
from
either
of
you
they
deserve
everything
they
get
but
when
after
another
mile
or
two
we
came
to
a
side
trail
leading
by
tish
map
not
to
many
glaciers
but
up
a
ravine
to
another
pass
and
tish
saw
that
they
had
taken
that
direction
we
were
puzzled
but
not
for
long
i
understand
now
she
said
it
is
all
clear
the
photographer
was
riding
ahead
to
get
them
up
this
valley
somewhere
they
probably
got
a
rendezvous
all
ready
with
another
camera
in
place
i
must
say
she
observed
that
they
are
doing
it
thoroughly
we
rode
for
two
hours
and
no
sign
of
them
the
stove
polish
had
come
off
the
handles
of
our
revolvers
by
that
time
and
aggie
having
rubbed
her
face
ever
and
anon
to
remove
perspiration
presented
under
her
turban
a
villainous
and
ferocious
expression
quite
at
variance
with
her
customary
mildness
i
urged
her
to
stop
and
wash
but
tish
after
a
glance
said
to
keep
on
your
looking
like
that
a
distinct
advantage
aggie
she
said
like
as
not
they
throw
up
their
hands
the
minute
they
see
you
i
know
i
should
you
better
ride
first
when
we
get
near
like
as
not
they
put
a
hole
in
me
aggie
objected
and
as
to
riding
first
i
will
not
this
is
your
doing
tish
carberry
and
as
for
their
having
blank
cartridges
how
do
we
know
someone
has
made
a
mistake
and
got
a
real
one
tish
reflected
on
that
it
a
possibility
she
agreed
if
we
find
that
they
going
to
spend
the
night
out
it
might
be
better
to
wait
until
they
taken
off
all
the
hardware
they
hung
with
but
we
did
not
come
up
with
them
we
kept
on
finding
traces
of
the
party
in
marshy
spots
and
once
tish
hopped
off
her
horse
and
picked
up
a
small
handkerchief
with
a
colored
border
and
held
it
up
to
us
it
hers
she
said
anybody
would
know
she
is
the
sort
to
use
colored
borders
they
ahead
somewhere
but
it
seemed
strange
that
they
would
go
so
far
and
i
said
so
we
far
enough
off
the
main
trail
tish
i
said
and
it
getting
wilder
every
minute
there
nothing
i
can
see
to
prevent
a
mountain
lion
dropping
on
us
most
any
time
not
if
it
gets
a
good
look
at
aggie
was
tish
grim
response
it
began
to
grow
dark
in
the
valley
and
things
seemed
to
move
on
either
side
of
the
trail
aggie
called
out
once
that
we
had
just
passed
a
grizzly
bear
but
tish
never
faltered
the
region
grew
more
and
more
wild
the
trail
was
broken
with
mudholes
and
crossed
by
fallen
logs
with
a
superb
disdain
tish
rode
across
all
obstacles
not
even
glancing
at
them
but
aggie
and
i
got
off
at
the
worst
places
and
led
our
horses
at
one
mudhole
i
was
unfortunate
enough
to
stumble
a
horse
with
a
particle
of
affection
for
a
woman
who
had
ridden
it
and
cared
for
it
for
several
days
would
have
paused
not
so
my
animal
with
a
heartlessness
at
which
i
still
shudder
the
creature
used
me
as
a
bridge
and
stepped
across
dryfoot
on
my
back
owing
to
his
padded
feet
and
to
the
depth
of
the
mud
some
eight
feet
i
believe
i
was
uninjured
but
it
required
ten
minutes
of
hard
labor
on
the
part
of
both
tish
and
aggie
to
release
me
from
the
mud
from
which
i
was
finally
raised
with
a
low
hissing
sound
park
said
aggie
as
she
scraped
my
obliterated
features
with
a
small
branch
park
indeed
it
a
howling
wilderness
i
fond
of
my
native
land
she
went
on
digging
out
my
nostrils
so
i
could
breathe
but
i
do
calculate
to
eat
it
as
for
that
unfeeling
beast
of
yours
lizzie
i
never
known
a
horse
to
show
such
selfishness
never
well
we
went
on
at
last
but
i
was
not
so
enthusiastic
about
teaching
people
lessons
as
i
had
been
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
might
have
kept
on
along
the
trail
and
had
a
mighty
good
time
getting
more
and
more
nimble
and
stopping
now
and
then
to
bake
a
pie
and
have
a
decent
meal
and
putting
up
our
hair
in
crimps
at
night
without
worrying
about
other
folks
affairs
late
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
when
so
far
as
i
could
see
tish
was
lost
and
not
even
her
gathering
a
bunch
of
wild
flowers
while
the
horses
rested
could
fool
me
i
voiced
my
complaint
let
me
look
at
the
map
tish
i
suggested
i
pretty
good
at
maps
you
know
how
i
am
at
charades
and
acrostics
at
the
church
supper
nonsense
lizzie
she
returned
you
could
make
head
or
tail
of
this
map
it
my
belief
that
the
man
who
made
it
had
never
been
here
either
that
or
there
has
been
an
earthquake
since
but
she
went
on
more
cheerfully
if
we
are
lost
so
are
the
others
if
we
even
had
bill
along
bill
tish
said
scornfully
it
my
belief
bill
is
in
the
whole
business
and
that
if
we
had
got
rid
of
him
we
have
been
the
next
advertising
dodge
as
far
as
that
goes
she
said
thoughtfully
it
would
surprise
me
a
particle
to
find
that
we
been
taken
without
our
knowing
it
most
any
time
your
horse
just
now
walking
across
that
bridge
of
size
for
one
thing
tish
seldom
makes
a
pun
which
she
herself
has
said
is
the
lowest
form
of
humor
the
dig
at
my
figure
was
unkind
also
and
unworthy
of
her
i
turned
and
left
her
at
last
well
on
in
the
evening
i
saw
tish
draw
up
her
horse
and
point
ahead
the
miscreants
she
said
true
enough
up
a
narrow
side
cañon
we
could
see
a
it
was
a
small
one
and
only
noticeable
from
one
point
but
tish
keen
eye
had
seen
it
she
sat
on
her
horse
and
gazed
toward
it
what
a
shameful
thing
it
is
she
said
to
prostitute
the
beauties
of
this
magnificent
region
to
such
a
purpose
to
make
of
these
beetling
crags
a
joke
to
invade
these
vast
gorges
with
the
spirit
of
commercialism
and
to
bring
a
pack
of
movie
actors
to
desecrate
the
virgin
silence
with
ribald
jests
and
laughter
lizzie
i
wish
you
would
wheeze
you
would
wheeze
too
tish
carberry
i
retorted
justly
indignant
if
a
horse
had
just
pressed
your
spinal
column
into
your
breast
bone
goodness
knows
i
said
where
my
lungs
are
i
missed
them
ever
since
my
fall
however
she
was
engrossed
with
larger
matters
and
ignored
my
petulance
she
is
a
woman
and
above
pettiness
we
made
our
way
slowly
up
the
cañon
the
movie
outfit
was
securely
camped
under
an
overhanging
rock
as
we
could
now
see
at
one
point
their
position
commanded
the
trail
which
was
hardly
more
than
a
track
through
the
wilderness
and
before
we
reached
this
point
we
dismounted
and
tish
surveyed
the
camp
through
her
glasses
we
better
wait
until
dark
tish
said
owing
to
the
padding
they
have
not
heard
us
but
it
looks
to
me
as
if
one
of
them
is
on
a
rock
watching
it
seemed
rather
strange
to
me
that
they
were
keeping
a
lookout
but
tish
only
shrugged
her
shoulders
if
i
know
anything
of
that
oliver
man
she
said
he
hates
to
let
a
camera
rest
like
as
not
he
got
it
set
up
among
the
trees
somewhere
taking
flashlights
of
wild
animals
it
rather
a
pity
she
said
turning
and
surveying
aggie
and
myself
that
he
can
not
get
you
two
if
you
happen
to
see
anything
edible
lying
on
the
ground
better
not
pick
it
up
it
probably
attached
to
the
string
that
sets
off
the
flash
we
led
our
horses
into
the
woods
which
were
very
thick
at
that
point
and
tied
them
my
beast
however
lay
down
and
rolled
saddle
and
all
thus
breaking
my
mirror
a
most
unlucky
omen
and
the
bottle
of
olive
oil
which
we
had
brought
along
for
mayonnaise
dressing
tish
is
fond
of
mayonnaise
and
besides
considers
olive
oil
most
strengthening
however
it
was
gone
and
although
aggie
comforted
me
by
suggesting
that
her
boiled
salad
dressing
is
quite
tasty
i
was
disconsolate
it
was
by
that
time
seven
and
almost
dark
we
held
a
conference
tish
was
of
the
opinion
that
we
should
first
lead
off
their
horses
if
possible
i
intend
she
said
severely
to
make
escape
impossible
if
they
fire
when
taken
by
surprise
remember
that
they
have
only
blank
cartridges
i
must
say
she
added
with
a
confession
of
unusual
weakness
that
i
am
glad
the
indians
escaped
the
other
way
i
would
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
indians
even
quite
tame
ones
while
i
know
a
few
letters
of
the
language
which
i
believe
all
tribes
use
in
common
i
fear
that
in
a
moment
of
excitement
i
would
forget
what
i
know
the
next
step
she
asserted
was
to
secure
their
weapons
after
all
she
said
the
darkness
is
in
our
favor
i
intend
to
fire
once
to
show
them
that
we
are
armed
and
dangerous
and
if
you
two
will
point
the
guns
bill
made
they
can
not
possibly
tell
that
they
are
not
real
but
we
will
know
it
aggie
quavered
now
that
the
quarry
was
in
sight
she
was
more
and
more
nervous
sneezing
at
short
intervals
in
spite
of
her
menthol
inhaler
i
am
sorry
tish
but
i
can
not
feel
the
same
about
that
wooden
revolver
as
i
would
about
a
real
one
and
even
when
i
try
to
forget
that
it
is
only
wood
the
carving
reminds
me
but
tish
silenced
her
with
a
glance
she
had
strangely
altered
in
the
last
few
minutes
all
traces
of
fatigue
had
gone
and
when
she
struck
a
match
and
consulted
her
watch
i
saw
in
her
face
that
high
resolve
that
stern
and
matchless
courage
which
i
so
often
have
tried
to
emulate
and
failed
seven
she
announced
we
will
dine
first
there
is
nothing
like
food
to
restore
failing
spirits
but
we
had
nothing
except
our
sandwiches
and
tish
suggested
snaring
some
of
the
stupid
squirrels
with
which
the
region
abounded
aggie
needs
broth
she
said
decidedly
we
have
sandwiches
but
aggie
is
frail
and
must
be
looked
to
aggie
was
pathetically
grateful
although
sorry
for
the
squirrels
which
were
pretty
and
quite
tame
but
tish
was
firm
in
her
kindly
intent
and
proceeded
at
once
to
set
a
rabbit
snare
a
trick
she
had
learned
in
the
maine
woods
having
done
this
and
built
a
small
fire
well
hidden
we
sat
down
to
wait
in
a
short
time
we
heard
terrible
human
cries
proceeding
from
the
snare
and
hurrying
thither
found
in
it
a
young
mountain
lion
it
looked
dangerous
and
was
biting
in
every
direction
i
admit
that
i
was
prepared
to
leave
in
haste
but
not
so
tish
she
fetched
her
umbrella
without
which
she
never
travels
and
while
the
animal
set
its
jaws
in
it
a
painful
necessity
as
it
was
her
best
umbrella
tish
hit
it
on
the
head
not
the
umbrella
but
the
lion
with
a
large
stone
tish
satisfaction
was
unbounded
she
stated
that
the
flesh
of
the
mountain
lion
was
much
like
veal
and
so
indeed
it
proved
we
made
a
nourishing
soup
of
it
with
potatoes
and
a
can
of
macédoine
vegetables
and
within
an
hour
and
a
half
we
had
dined
luxuriously
adding
to
our
repast
what
remained
of
the
sandwiches
and
a
tinned
plum
pudding
of
english
make
very
nutritious
and
delicious
for
twenty
minutes
after
the
meal
we
all
stood
tish
insists
on
this
as
aiding
digestion
then
we
prepared
for
the
night
work
i
believe
that
our
conduct
requires
no
defense
but
it
may
be
well
again
to
explain
our
position
these
people
whose
glowed
so
brazenly
against
the
opposite
cliff
had
for
purely
mercenary
motives
committed
a
cruel
hoax
they
had
posed
as
bandits
and
as
bandits
they
deserved
to
be
treated
they
had
held
up
our
own
clergyman
of
a
nervous
temperament
on
a
mountain
pass
and
had
taken
from
him
a
part
of
his
stipend
it
was
heartless
it
was
barbarous
it
was
cruel
my
own
courage
came
back
with
the
hot
food
which
i
followed
by
a
charcoal
tablet
and
the
difference
in
aggie
was
marked
possibly
some
of
the
courage
of
the
mountain
lion
that
bravest
of
wild
creatures
had
communicated
itself
to
her
through
the
homely
medicine
of
digestion
i
can
hardly
wait
to
get
after
them
she
said
however
it
was
still
too
early
for
them
to
have
settled
for
the
night
we
sat
down
having
extinguished
our
fire
and
i
was
just
dozing
off
when
tish
remembered
the
young
man
who
was
to
have
listened
for
the
police
whistle
i
absolutely
forgot
him
she
said
regretfully
i
suppose
he
is
hanging
round
the
foot
of
piegan
pass
yet
i
sorry
to
have
him
miss
this
i
shall
tell
him
when
i
see
him
that
no
girl
worth
having
would
be
sitting
over
there
at
supper
with
four
actors
without
a
chaperon
the
whole
proceeding
is
scandalous
i
have
noticed
she
added
that
it
is
the
girls
from
quiet
suburban
towns
who
are
really
most
prone
to
defy
the
conventions
when
the
chance
comes
we
dozed
for
a
short
time
then
tish
sat
up
suddenly
what
that
she
said
we
listened
and
distinctly
heard
the
tramp
of
horses
feet
we
started
up
but
tish
was
quite
calm
they
turned
their
horses
out
she
said
fortune
is
with
us
they
are
coming
this
way
but
at
first
it
did
not
seem
so
fortunate
for
we
heard
one
of
the
men
following
them
stumbling
along
and
i
regret
to
say
using
profane
language
they
came
directly
toward
us
and
aggie
beside
me
trembled
but
tish
was
equal
to
the
emergency
she
drew
us
behind
a
large
rock
where
spreading
out
a
raincoat
to
protect
us
from
the
dampness
we
sat
down
and
waited
when
one
of
the
animals
loomed
up
close
to
the
rock
aggie
gave
a
low
cry
but
tish
covered
her
mouth
fiercely
with
an
ungentle
hand
be
still
she
hissed
it
was
now
perfectly
dark
and
the
man
with
the
horses
was
not
far
off
we
could
not
see
him
but
at
last
he
came
near
enough
so
that
we
could
see
the
flare
of
a
match
when
he
lighted
a
cigarette
i
put
my
hand
on
aggie
and
she
was
shaking
with
nervousness
i
am
sure
i
am
going
to
sneeze
lizzie
she
gasped
and
sneeze
she
did
she
muffled
it
considerably
however
and
we
were
not
discovered
but
tish
i
knew
was
silently
raging
the
horses
came
nearer
one
of
them
indeed
came
quite
close
and
took
a
nip
at
the
toe
of
my
i
kicked
at
it
sharply
however
and
it
moved
away
the
man
had
gone
on
we
watched
the
light
of
his
cigarette
and
thus
as
he
now
and
then
turned
his
head
knew
where
he
was
it
was
now
that
i
felt
rather
than
heard
that
tish
was
crawling
out
from
the
shelter
of
the
rock
at
the
same
time
we
heard
by
the
crunching
of
branches
that
the
man
had
sat
down
near
at
hand
tish
progress
was
slow
but
sure
for
a
we
sat
there
then
she
returned
still
crawling
and
on
putting
out
my
hand
i
discovered
that
she
had
secured
the
lasso
from
her
saddle
and
had
brought
it
back
how
true
had
been
her
instinct
when
she
practiced
its
use
how
my
own
words
that
it
was
all
foolishness
came
back
and
whispered
lessons
of
humility
in
my
ear
at
this
moment
a
deep
resonant
sound
came
from
the
tree
where
the
movie
actor
sat
at
the
same
moment
a
small
creature
dropped
into
my
lap
from
somewhere
above
and
ran
up
my
sleeve
i
made
frantic
although
necessarily
silent
efforts
to
dislodge
it
and
it
bit
me
severely
the
necessity
for
silence
taxed
all
my
strength
but
managing
finally
to
secure
it
by
the
tail
i
forcibly
withdrew
it
and
flung
it
away
unluckily
it
struck
aggie
in
the
left
eye
and
inflicted
a
painful
bruise
tish
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
was
standing
a
silent
and
menacing
figure
while
this
event
transpired
the
movements
of
the
horses
as
they
grazed
the
soft
breeze
blowing
through
the
pines
were
the
only
sounds
now
she
took
a
step
forward
he
asleep
she
whispered
aggie
sit
still
and
watch
the
horses
lizzie
come
with
me
as
i
advanced
to
her
she
thrust
her
revolver
into
my
hand
when
i
give
the
word
she
said
in
a
whisper
hold
it
against
his
neck
but
keep
your
finger
off
the
trigger
it
loaded
we
advanced
slowly
halting
now
and
then
to
listen
although
brush
crackled
under
our
feet
the
grazing
horses
were
making
a
similar
disturbance
and
the
man
slept
on
soon
we
could
see
him
clearly
sitting
back
against
a
tree
his
head
dropped
forward
on
his
breast
tish
surveyed
the
scene
with
her
keen
and
appraising
eye
and
raised
the
lasso
the
first
result
was
not
good
the
loaded
end
struck
a
branch
and
being
deflected
the
thing
wrapped
itself
perhaps
a
dozen
times
round
my
neck
tish
being
unconscious
of
what
had
happened
drew
it
up
with
a
jerk
and
i
stood
helpless
and
slowly
strangling
at
last
however
she
realized
the
difficulty
and
released
me
i
was
unable
to
breathe
comfortably
for
some
time
and
my
tongue
felt
swollen
for
several
hours
through
all
of
this
the
movie
actor
had
slept
soundly
at
the
second
effort
tish
succeeded
in
lassoing
him
without
difficulty
we
had
feared
a
loud
outcry
before
we
could
get
to
him
but
owing
to
tish
swiftness
in
tightening
the
rope
he
was
able
to
make
at
first
only
a
low
gurgling
sound
i
had
advanced
to
him
and
was
under
the
impression
that
i
was
holding
the
revolver
to
his
neck
on
discovering
however
that
i
was
pressing
it
to
the
trunk
of
the
tree
to
which
he
was
now
secured
by
the
lariat
i
corrected
the
error
and
held
it
against
his
ear
he
was
now
wide
awake
and
struggling
violently
then
i
regret
to
say
he
broke
out
into
such
language
as
i
have
never
heard
before
at
request
i
suppress
his
oaths
and
substitute
for
them
harmless
expressions
in
common
use
good
gracious
he
said
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
anyhow
jimminy
crickets
take
that
thing
away
from
my
neck
great
scott
and
land
alive
i
have
done
anything
my
word
that
gun
will
go
off
if
you
are
careful
i
am
aware
that
much
of
the
strength
of
what
he
said
is
lost
in
this
free
translation
but
it
is
impossible
to
repeat
his
real
language
do
move
tish
said
and
do
call
out
a
sound
and
a
bullet
goes
crashing
through
your
brain
a
woman
he
said
in
most
unflattering
amazement
great
jehoshaphat
a
woman
this
again
is
only
a
translation
of
what
he
said
exactly
tish
observed
calmly
she
had
cut
the
end
off
the
lasso
with
her
scissors
and
was
now
tying
his
feet
together
with
it
my
friend
we
know
the
whole
story
and
i
am
ashamed
ashamed
she
said
oratorically
of
your
sex
to
frighten
a
harmless
and
preacher
and
his
wife
for
the
purpose
of
publicity
is
not
a
joke
such
hoaxes
are
criminal
if
you
must
have
publicity
why
not
seek
it
in
some
other
way
crazy
he
groaned
to
himself
in
the
hands
of
lunatics
oh
my
goodness
again
these
were
not
exactly
his
words
having
bound
him
tightly
hand
and
foot
and
taken
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
tish
straightened
herself
now
we
gag
him
lizzie
she
said
we
have
other
things
to
do
than
to
stand
here
and
converse
then
she
turned
to
the
man
and
told
him
a
deliberate
lie
i
am
sorry
to
record
this
but
a
tendency
to
avoid
the
straight
and
narrow
issues
of
truth
when
facing
a
crisis
is
one
of
tish
weaknesses
the
only
flaw
in
an
otherwise
strong
and
perfect
character
we
are
going
to
leave
you
here
she
said
but
one
of
our
number
fully
armed
will
be
near
by
a
sound
from
you
or
any
endeavor
to
call
for
succor
will
end
sadly
for
you
a
word
to
the
wise
now
lizzie
take
that
bandanna
off
his
neck
and
tie
it
over
his
mouth
tish
stood
looking
down
at
him
and
her
very
silhouette
was
scornful
think
my
friend
she
said
of
the
ignominy
of
your
position
is
any
moving
picture
worth
it
is
the
pleasure
of
seeing
yourself
on
the
screen
any
reward
for
such
a
shameful
position
as
yours
now
is
no
a
thousand
times
no
he
made
a
choking
sound
in
his
throat
and
writhed
helplessly
and
so
we
left
him
a
hopeless
and
miserable
figure
to
ponder
on
his
sins
that
one
said
tish
briskly
there
are
only
three
left
come
aggie
she
said
cheerfully
to
work
we
have
made
a
good
beginning
it
is
with
modesty
that
i
approach
that
night
events
remembering
always
that
tish
was
the
brain
which
conceived
and
carried
out
the
affair
we
were
but
her
loyal
and
eager
assistants
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
thought
and
still
think
that
the
money
should
have
been
divided
so
as
to
give
tish
the
lion
share
but
she
dear
magnanimous
soul
refused
even
to
hear
of
such
a
course
and
insisted
that
we
share
it
equally
of
that
however
more
anon
we
next
proceeded
to
capture
their
horses
and
to
tie
them
up
we
regretted
the
necessity
for
this
since
the
unfortunate
animals
had
traveled
far
and
were
doubtless
hungry
it
went
to
my
heart
to
drag
them
from
their
fragrant
pasture
and
to
tie
them
to
trees
but
as
tish
said
necessity
knows
no
law
not
even
kindness
so
we
tied
them
up
not
however
until
we
had
moved
them
far
from
the
trail
tish
stopped
then
and
stared
across
the
cañon
to
the
enemy
no
quarter
remember
she
said
and
bring
your
weapons
we
grasped
our
wooden
revolvers
and
with
tish
leading
started
for
the
camp
unluckily
there
was
a
stream
between
us
and
it
was
necessary
to
ford
it
it
shows
tish
true
generalship
that
instead
of
removing
her
shoes
and
stockings
as
aggie
and
i
were
about
to
do
she
suggested
getting
our
horses
and
riding
across
this
we
did
and
alighted
on
the
other
side
dryshod
it
was
on
consulting
my
watch
nine
and
very
dark
a
few
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
also
and
the
distant
was
burning
low
tish
gave
us
each
a
little
blackberry
cordial
for
fear
of
dampness
and
took
some
herself
the
mild
glow
which
followed
was
very
comforting
it
was
tish
naturally
who
went
forward
to
reconnoiter
she
returned
in
an
hour
to
report
that
the
three
men
were
lying
round
the
fire
two
asleep
and
one
leaning
on
his
elbow
with
a
revolver
handy
she
did
not
see
oliver
and
it
was
possible
that
it
was
he
we
had
tied
to
the
tree
the
girl
she
said
was
sitting
on
a
log
with
her
chin
propped
in
her
hands
she
looked
rather
tish
said
i
expect
she
liked
the
first
young
man
better
than
she
thought
she
did
i
intend
to
give
her
a
piece
of
my
mind
as
soon
as
i
get
a
chance
this
playing
hot
and
cold
is
maidenly
to
say
the
least
we
now
moved
slowly
forward
after
tying
our
horses
toward
the
last
following
tish
example
we
went
on
our
hands
and
knees
and
i
was
thankful
then
for
no
skirts
it
is
wonderful
the
freedom
a
man
has
i
was
never
one
to
approve
of
doctor
mary
walker
but
i
not
so
sure
she
is
a
wise
woman
and
the
rest
of
us
fools
i
have
put
on
a
skirt
braid
since
that
time
without
begrudging
it
well
as
i
have
stated
we
advanced
and
at
last
we
were
in
full
sight
of
the
camp
i
must
say
i
have
thought
they
have
a
tent
we
expected
something
better
i
suppose
because
of
the
articles
in
the
papers
about
movie
people
having
their
own
limousines
and
all
that
but
there
they
were
open
to
the
wrath
of
the
heavens
and
deserving
it
if
i
do
say
so
the
girl
was
still
sitting
as
tish
had
described
her
only
now
she
was
crying
my
heart
was
downright
sore
for
her
it
is
no
comfort
having
made
a
wrong
choice
to
know
that
it
is
one
own
fault
having
now
reached
the
zone
of
firelight
tish
gave
the
signal
and
we
rose
and
pointed
our
revolvers
at
them
then
tish
stepped
forward
and
said
hands
up
i
shall
never
forget
the
expression
on
the
man
face
he
shouted
something
but
he
threw
up
his
hands
also
with
his
eyes
popping
out
of
his
head
the
others
scrambled
to
their
feet
but
he
warned
them
careful
boys
he
yelled
they
got
the
drop
on
us
just
then
his
eyes
fell
on
aggie
and
he
screeched
two
women
and
a
turk
by
the
blank
is
mine
lizzie
said
tish
sternly
as
all
of
them
including
the
girl
held
their
hands
up
just
give
me
your
weapon
and
go
over
them
go
over
them
i
said
not
understanding
search
them
said
tish
take
everything
out
of
their
pockets
and
do
move
she
ordered
them
sternly
one
motion
and
i
fire
go
on
lizzie
now
i
have
never
searched
a
man
pockets
and
the
idea
was
repugnant
to
me
i
am
a
woman
of
delicate
instincts
but
tish
face
was
stern
i
did
as
commanded
therefore
the
total
result
being
four
revolvers
two
large
knives
one
small
knife
one
bunch
of
keys
one
plug
of
four
cartridge
belts
two
old
pipes
ostermaier
which
i
recognized
at
once
being
the
one
we
had
presented
to
him
ostermaier
and
gold
bracelet
which
her
sister
gave
her
on
her
last
birthday
a
diamond
solitaire
unknown
as
ostermaier
never
owned
one
preferring
instead
earrings
as
more
showy
and
a
considerable
sum
of
money
which
i
kept
but
did
not
count
there
were
other
small
articles
of
no
value
is
that
all
the
loot
you
secured
during
the
infamous
scene
on
piegan
pass
tish
demanded
you
need
not
hide
anything
from
us
we
know
the
facts
and
the
whole
story
will
soon
be
public
that
all
lady
whined
one
of
the
men
except
a
few
boxes
of
lunch
and
that
gone
lady
lem
me
take
my
hands
down
i
got
a
stiff
shoulder
and
i
keep
them
up
tish
snapped
aggie
see
that
they
keep
them
up
until
that
time
we
had
been
too
occupied
to
observe
the
girl
who
merely
stood
and
watched
in
a
disdainful
sort
of
way
but
now
tish
turned
and
eyed
her
sternly
search
her
lizzie
she
commanded
search
me
the
girl
exclaimed
indignantly
certainly
not
lizzie
said
tish
in
her
sternest
manner
go
over
that
girl
look
in
her
i
have
come
across
ostermaier
earrings
yet
at
that
the
girl
changed
color
and
backed
off
it
an
outrage
she
said
surely
i
have
suffered
enough
not
as
much
tish
observed
as
you
are
going
to
suffer
go
over
her
lizzie
while
i
searched
her
tish
was
lecturing
her
you
come
from
a
good
home
i
understand
she
said
and
you
ought
to
know
better
not
content
with
breaking
an
honest
heart
you
join
a
outfit
and
frighten
a
prominent
divine
for
ostermaier
is
well
known
into
what
may
be
an
illness
you
can
not
deny
she
accused
her
that
it
was
you
who
coaxed
them
to
the
pass
at
least
you
need
we
heard
you
how
was
i
to
know
the
girl
began
sullenly
but
at
that
moment
i
found
ostermaier
chamois
bag
thrust
into
her
and
she
suddenly
went
pale
tish
held
it
up
before
her
accusingly
i
dare
say
you
will
not
deny
this
she
exclaimed
and
took
ostermaier
earrings
out
of
it
the
men
muttered
but
aggie
was
equal
to
the
occasion
silence
she
said
and
pointed
the
revolver
at
each
in
turn
the
girl
started
to
speak
then
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
could
explain
she
said
but
i
wo
if
you
think
i
stole
those
hideous
earrings
you
welcome
to
of
course
not
said
tish
sarcastically
no
doubt
she
gave
them
to
you
although
i
never
knew
her
to
give
anything
away
before
the
girl
stood
still
thinking
suddenly
she
said
there
another
one
you
know
another
man
we
have
him
he
will
give
no
further
trouble
tish
observed
grimly
i
think
we
have
you
all
except
your
mr
oliver
he
is
not
my
oliver
said
the
girl
i
never
want
to
see
him
again
i
i
hate
him
you
have
got
much
mind
or
you
could
change
it
so
quickly
she
looked
sulky
again
and
said
she
thank
us
for
the
ring
which
was
hers
and
she
could
prove
it
but
tish
sternly
refused
it
my
private
opinion
she
observed
that
it
is
ostermaier
and
she
has
not
worn
it
openly
because
of
the
congregation
talking
quite
considerably
about
her
earrings
and
not
caring
for
jewelry
on
the
minister
wife
that
what
i
think
shortly
after
that
we
heard
a
horse
loping
along
the
road
it
came
nearer
and
then
left
the
trail
and
came
toward
the
fire
tish
picked
up
one
of
the
extra
revolvers
and
pointed
it
it
was
oliver
throw
up
your
hands
tish
called
and
he
did
it
he
turned
a
sort
of
blue
color
too
when
he
saw
us
and
all
the
men
with
their
hands
up
but
he
looked
relieved
when
he
saw
the
girl
thank
heaven
he
said
the
way
i
been
riding
this
country
you
rode
hard
enough
away
from
the
pass
she
replied
coldly
we
took
a
revolver
away
from
him
and
lined
him
up
with
the
others
all
the
time
he
was
paying
little
attention
to
us
and
none
at
all
to
the
other
men
but
he
was
pleading
with
the
girl
honestly
he
said
i
thought
i
could
do
better
for
everybody
by
doing
what
i
did
how
did
i
know
he
pleaded
that
you
were
going
to
do
such
a
crazy
thing
as
this
but
she
only
stared
at
him
as
if
she
hated
the
very
ground
he
stood
on
it
a
pity
tish
observed
that
you
have
got
your
camera
along
this
would
make
a
very
nice
picture
but
i
dare
say
you
could
hardly
turn
the
crank
with
your
hands
in
the
air
we
searched
him
carefully
but
he
had
only
a
gold
watch
and
some
money
on
the
chance
however
that
the
watch
was
ostermaier
although
unlikely
we
took
it
i
must
say
he
was
very
disagreeable
referring
to
us
as
highwaymen
and
using
uncomplimentary
language
but
as
tish
observed
we
might
as
well
be
thorough
while
we
were
about
it
for
the
nonce
we
had
forgotten
the
other
man
but
now
i
noticed
that
the
wore
a
watchful
and
not
unhopeful
air
and
suddenly
one
of
them
whistled
a
thin
shrill
note
that
had
as
tish
later
remarked
great
penetrative
power
without
being
noisy
that
enough
of
that
she
said
aggie
take
another
of
these
guns
and
point
them
both
at
these
gentlemen
if
they
whistle
again
shoot
as
to
the
other
man
he
will
not
reply
nor
will
he
come
to
your
assistance
he
is
gagged
and
tied
and
into
the
bargain
may
become
at
any
time
the
victim
of
wild
beasts
the
moment
she
had
said
it
tish
realized
that
it
was
but
too
true
and
she
grew
thoughtful
aggie
too
was
far
from
comfortable
she
said
later
that
she
was
uncertain
what
to
do
tish
had
said
to
fire
if
they
whistled
again
the
question
in
her
mind
was
had
it
been
said
purely
for
effect
or
did
tish
mean
it
after
all
the
men
were
not
real
bandits
she
reflected
although
guilty
of
theft
even
if
only
for
advertising
purposes
she
was
greatly
disturbed
and
as
agitation
always
causes
a
return
of
her
hay
fever
she
began
to
sneeze
violently
until
then
the
men
had
been
quiet
if
furious
but
now
they
fell
into
abject
terror
imploring
tish
whom
they
easily
recognized
as
the
leader
to
take
the
revolvers
from
her
but
tish
only
said
no
fatalities
aggie
please
point
at
an
arm
or
a
leg
until
the
spasm
subsides
her
tone
was
quite
gentle
heretofore
this
has
been
a
plain
narrative
dull
i
fear
in
many
places
but
i
come
now
to
a
not
unexciting
incident
which
for
a
time
placed
tish
and
myself
in
an
unpleasant
position
i
refer
to
the
escape
of
the
man
we
had
tied
we
held
a
brief
discussion
as
to
what
to
do
with
our
prisoners
until
morning
a
discussion
which
tish
solved
with
her
usual
celerity
by
cutting
from
the
saddles
which
lay
round
the
fire
a
number
of
those
leather
thongs
with
which
such
saddles
are
adorned
and
which
are
used
in
case
of
necessity
to
strap
various
articles
to
the
aforesaid
saddles
with
these
thongs
we
tied
them
not
uncomfortably
but
firmly
their
hands
behind
them
and
their
feet
fastened
together
then
as
the
night
grew
cold
tish
suggested
that
we
shove
them
near
the
fire
which
we
did
the
young
lady
however
offered
a
more
difficult
problem
we
compromised
by
giving
her
her
freedom
but
arranging
for
one
of
our
number
to
keep
her
covered
with
a
revolver
you
need
be
so
thoughtful
she
said
angrily
and
with
a
total
lack
of
appreciation
of
tish
considerate
attitude
i
rather
be
tied
especially
if
the
moslem
with
the
hay
fever
is
going
to
hold
the
gun
it
was
at
that
moment
that
we
heard
a
whistle
from
across
the
stream
and
each
of
the
prostrate
men
raised
his
head
eagerly
before
tish
could
interfere
one
of
them
had
whistled
three
times
sharply
probably
a
danger
signal
without
a
word
tish
turned
and
ran
toward
the
stream
calling
to
me
to
follow
her
tish
i
heard
aggie
agonized
tone
lizzie
come
back
do
leave
me
here
alone
i
here
she
evidently
clutched
the
revolver
involuntarily
for
there
was
a
sharp
report
and
a
bullet
struck
a
tree
near
us
tish
paused
and
turned
point
that
thing
up
into
the
air
aggie
she
called
back
and
stay
there
i
hold
you
responsible
i
heard
aggie
give
a
low
moan
but
she
said
nothing
and
we
kept
on
the
moon
had
now
come
up
flooding
the
valley
with
silver
radiance
we
found
our
horses
at
once
and
tish
leaped
into
the
saddle
being
heavier
and
also
out
of
breath
from
having
stumbled
over
a
log
i
was
somewhat
slower
tish
was
therefore
in
advance
of
me
when
we
started
and
it
was
she
who
caught
sight
of
him
first
he
got
a
horse
lizzie
she
called
back
to
me
we
can
get
him
i
think
remember
he
is
unarmed
fortunately
he
had
made
for
the
trail
which
was
here
wider
than
ordinary
and
gleamed
white
in
the
moonlight
we
had
however
lost
some
time
in
fording
the
stream
and
we
had
but
the
one
glimpse
of
him
as
the
trail
curved
tish
lashed
her
horse
to
a
lope
and
mine
followed
without
urging
i
had
unfortunately
lost
a
stirrup
early
in
the
chase
and
was
compelled
being
unable
to
recover
it
to
drop
the
lines
and
clutch
the
saddle
twice
tish
fired
into
the
air
she
explained
afterward
that
she
did
this
for
the
moral
effect
on
the
fugitive
but
as
each
time
it
caused
my
horse
to
jump
and
almost
unseat
me
at
last
i
begged
her
to
desist
we
struck
at
last
into
a
straight
piece
of
trail
ending
in
a
wall
of
granite
and
up
this
the
trail
climbed
in
a
switchback
tish
turned
to
me
we
have
him
now
she
said
when
he
starts
up
there
he
is
as
much
gone
as
a
fly
on
the
wall
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
said
as
calmly
as
though
we
had
been
taking
an
afternoon
stroll
his
taking
this
trail
shows
that
he
is
a
novice
and
no
real
highwayman
otherwise
he
would
have
turned
off
into
the
woods
at
that
moment
the
fugitive
horse
emerged
into
the
moonlight
and
tish
smiled
grimly
i
see
why
now
she
exclaimed
the
idiot
has
happened
on
mona
lisa
who
must
have
returned
and
followed
us
and
no
can
be
made
to
leave
the
trail
unless
by
means
of
a
hornet
look
he
trying
to
pull
her
off
and
she
wo
go
it
was
true
as
we
now
perceived
he
saw
his
danger
but
too
late
mona
lisa
probably
still
disagreeable
after
her
experience
with
the
hornets
held
straight
for
the
cliff
the
moon
shone
full
on
it
and
when
he
was
only
thirty
feet
up
its
face
tish
fired
again
and
the
fugitive
stopped
come
down
said
tish
quietly
he
said
a
great
many
things
which
like
his
earlier
language
i
do
not
care
to
repeat
but
after
a
second
shot
he
began
to
descend
slowly
tish
however
approached
him
warily
having
given
her
revolver
to
me
he
might
try
to
get
it
from
me
lizzie
she
observed
keep
it
pointed
in
our
direction
but
not
at
us
i
going
to
tie
him
again
this
she
proceeded
to
do
tying
his
hands
behind
him
and
fastening
his
belt
also
to
the
horn
of
the
saddle
but
leaving
his
feet
free
all
this
was
done
to
the
accompaniment
of
bitter
vituperation
she
pretended
to
ignore
this
but
it
made
an
impression
evidently
for
at
last
she
replied
you
have
no
one
to
blame
but
yourself
she
said
you
deserve
your
present
humiliating
position
and
you
know
it
i
made
up
my
mind
to
take
you
all
in
and
expose
your
cruel
scheme
and
i
intend
to
do
it
nothing
if
i
am
not
thorough
she
finished
he
made
no
reply
to
this
and
in
fact
he
made
only
one
speech
on
the
way
back
and
that
i
am
happy
to
say
was
without
profanity
it
is
being
taken
in
that
i
mind
so
much
he
said
pathetically
it
all
in
the
game
and
i
can
stand
up
as
well
under
trouble
as
any
one
it
being
led
in
by
a
crowd
of
women
that
makes
it
painful
i
have
neglected
to
say
that
tish
was
leading
mona
lisa
while
i
followed
with
the
revolver
it
was
not
far
from
dawn
when
we
reached
the
camp
again
aggie
was
as
we
had
left
her
but
in
the
light
of
the
dying
fire
she
looked
older
and
much
worn
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
some
weeks
before
she
looked
like
her
old
self
the
girl
was
sitting
where
we
had
left
her
and
sulkier
than
ever
she
had
turned
her
back
to
oliver
and
aggie
said
afterward
that
the
way
they
had
quarreled
had
been
something
terrible
aggie
said
she
had
tried
to
make
conversation
with
the
girl
and
had
indeed
told
her
of
wiggins
and
her
own
blasted
life
but
she
had
remained
singularly
unresponsive
the
return
of
our
new
prisoner
was
greeted
by
the
other
men
with
brutal
rage
except
oliver
who
merely
glanced
at
him
and
then
went
back
to
his
staring
at
the
fire
it
appeared
that
they
had
been
counting
on
him
to
get
assistance
and
his
capture
destroyed
their
last
hope
indeed
their
language
grew
so
unpleasant
that
at
last
tish
hammered
sharply
on
a
rock
with
the
handle
of
her
revolver
please
remember
she
said
that
you
are
in
the
presence
of
ladies
they
jeered
at
her
but
she
handled
the
situation
with
her
usual
generalship
lizzie
she
said
calmly
get
the
tin
basin
that
is
hanging
to
my
saddle
and
fill
it
with
the
water
from
that
snowbank
on
the
occasion
of
any
more
unseemly
language
pour
it
over
the
offender
without
mercy
it
became
necessary
to
do
it
i
regret
to
state
they
had
not
yet
learned
that
tish
always
carries
out
her
threats
it
was
the
one
who
we
felt
was
the
leader
who
offended
and
i
did
as
i
had
been
requested
to
but
aggie
ever
feared
that
it
would
give
the
man
a
severe
cold
and
got
tish
permission
to
pour
a
little
blackberry
cordial
down
his
throat
far
from
this
kindness
having
a
salubrious
effect
it
had
the
contrary
they
all
fell
to
bad
language
again
and
realizing
that
they
wished
the
cordial
and
our
supply
being
limited
we
were
compelled
to
abandon
the
treatment
it
had
been
an
uncomfortable
night
and
i
confess
to
a
feeling
of
relief
when
the
rift
of
dawn
broke
the
early
skies
we
were
tish
calculated
some
forty
miles
from
breakfast
and
diet
for
some
days
had
been
light
at
the
best
even
the
broth
having
been
more
stimulating
than
staying
we
therefore
investigated
the
camp
and
found
behind
a
large
stone
some
flour
and
bacon
with
this
equipment
and
a
or
two
we
were
able
to
make
some
very
fair
pancakes
or
flapjacks
as
they
are
called
in
the
west
tish
civilly
invited
the
girl
to
eat
with
us
but
she
refused
curtly
although
on
turning
once
i
saw
her
eyeing
us
with
famished
eyes
i
think
however
that
on
seeing
us
going
about
the
homely
task
of
getting
breakfast
she
realized
that
we
were
not
the
desperate
creatures
she
had
fancied
during
the
night
but
three
gentlewomen
on
a
holiday
simple
tourists
indeed
i
wish
she
said
at
last
almost
wistfully
i
wish
that
i
could
understand
it
all
i
seem
to
be
all
mixed
up
you
do
suppose
i
want
to
be
here
do
you
but
tish
was
not
in
a
mood
to
make
concessions
as
for
what
you
want
she
said
how
are
we
to
know
that
you
are
here
are
you
here
as
a
result
of
your
own
had
you
remained
true
to
the
very
estimable
young
man
you
jilted
you
would
not
now
be
in
this
position
of
course
he
would
talk
about
it
said
the
girl
darkly
i
am
convinced
tish
went
on
dexterously
turning
a
pancake
by
a
swift
movement
of
the
pan
that
sensational
movies
are
responsible
for
much
that
is
wrong
with
the
country
they
set
false
standards
perfectly
people
see
them
and
are
filled
with
thoughts
of
crime
although
she
had
ignored
him
steadily
the
girl
turned
now
to
oliver
they
do
believe
anything
i
tell
them
why
do
you
explain
she
demanded
explain
he
said
in
a
furious
voice
explain
to
three
lunatics
what
the
use
you
got
me
into
this
you
know
i
did
i
like
that
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
induced
you
to
ride
off
the
way
you
did
tish
paused
with
the
in
the
air
silence
she
commanded
you
are
both
only
reaping
what
you
have
sowed
as
far
as
quarreling
goes
you
can
keep
that
until
you
are
married
if
you
intend
to
be
i
do
know
but
i
advise
it
it
a
pity
to
spoil
two
houses
but
the
girl
said
that
she
would
marry
him
if
he
was
the
last
man
on
earth
and
he
fell
back
to
sulking
again
as
aggie
observed
later
he
acted
as
if
he
had
never
cared
for
her
while
bell
on
the
contrary
could
not
help
his
face
changing
when
he
so
much
as
mentioned
her
name
we
made
some
tea
and
ate
a
hearty
breakfast
while
the
men
watched
us
and
as
we
ate
tish
held
the
business
up
to
contumely
and
scorn
lady
said
one
of
the
prostrate
men
are
you
going
to
give
us
anything
to
eat
people
tish
said
ignoring
him
who
would
ordinarily
cringe
at
the
sight
of
a
wounded
beetle
sit
through
bloody
murders
and
go
home
with
the
obsession
of
crime
i
hope
you
wo
take
it
amiss
said
the
man
again
if
i
say
that
seeing
it
our
flour
and
bacon
you
either
ought
to
feed
us
or
take
it
away
and
eat
it
where
we
ca
see
you
i
take
it
said
tish
to
the
girl
pouring
in
more
batter
that
you
yourself
would
never
have
thought
of
highway
robbery
had
you
not
been
led
to
it
by
an
overstimulated
imagination
i
wish
said
the
girl
rudely
that
you
would
talk
so
much
got
a
headache
when
we
had
finished
tish
indicated
the
and
the
batter
perhaps
she
said
you
would
like
to
bake
some
cakes
for
these
friends
of
yours
we
have
a
long
trip
ahead
of
us
but
the
girl
replied
heartlessly
that
she
hoped
they
would
starve
to
death
ignoring
their
pitiful
glances
in
the
end
it
was
our
own
aggie
who
baked
pancakes
for
them
and
loosening
their
hands
while
i
stood
guard
saw
that
they
had
not
only
food
but
the
gentle
refreshment
of
fresh
tea
tish
it
was
however
who
not
to
be
outdone
in
magnanimity
permitted
them
to
go
one
by
one
to
the
stream
to
wash
escape
without
horses
or
weapons
was
impossible
and
they
realized
it
by
nine
we
were
ready
to
return
and
here
a
difficulty
presented
itself
there
were
six
prisoners
and
only
three
of
us
the
men
fed
now
were
looking
less
subdued
although
they
pretended
to
obey
commands
with
alacrity
aggie
overheard
a
scrap
of
conversation
too
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
they
had
not
given
up
hope
had
tish
not
set
her
heart
on
leading
them
into
the
great
hotel
at
many
glaciers
and
there
exposing
them
to
the
taunts
of
angry
tourists
it
would
have
been
simpler
for
one
of
us
to
ride
for
assistance
leaving
the
others
there
in
this
emergency
tish
putting
her
hand
into
her
pocket
for
her
scissors
to
trim
a
hangnail
happened
to
come
across
the
whistle
my
gracious
she
said
i
forgot
my
promise
to
that
young
man
she
immediately
put
it
to
her
lips
and
blew
three
shrill
blasts
to
our
surprise
they
were
answered
by
a
halloo
and
a
moment
later
the
young
gentleman
himself
appeared
on
the
trail
he
was
no
longer
afoot
but
was
mounted
on
a
pinto
pony
which
we
knew
at
once
for
bill
he
sat
on
his
horse
staring
as
if
he
could
not
believe
his
eyes
then
he
made
his
way
across
the
stream
toward
us
good
heavens
he
said
what
in
the
name
of
here
his
eyes
fell
on
the
girl
and
he
stiffened
jim
cried
the
girl
and
looked
at
him
with
what
aggie
afterward
characterized
as
a
most
touching
expression
but
he
ignored
her
looks
as
though
you
folks
have
been
pretty
busy
he
observed
glancing
at
our
scowling
captives
i
a
trifle
surprised
you
do
mind
my
being
rather
breathless
do
you
my
only
regret
tish
said
loftily
is
that
we
have
not
secured
the
indians
they
too
should
be
taught
a
lesson
i
am
sure
that
the
red
man
is
noble
until
led
away
by
civilized
people
who
might
know
better
it
was
at
this
point
that
bell
eyes
fell
on
oliver
who
with
his
hands
tied
behind
him
was
crouching
over
the
fire
well
he
said
so
you
here
too
but
of
course
you
would
be
this
he
said
bitterly
for
the
love
of
heaven
bell
oliver
said
tell
those
mad
women
that
i
not
a
bandit
we
know
that
already
tish
observed
and
untie
my
hands
my
shoulders
are
about
broken
but
bell
only
looked
at
him
coldly
i
ca
interfere
with
these
ladies
he
said
they
friends
of
mine
if
they
think
you
are
better
tied
it
their
business
they
did
it
at
least
oliver
said
savagely
you
can
tell
them
who
i
am
you
as
to
that
bell
returned
i
can
only
tell
them
what
you
say
you
are
you
must
remember
that
i
know
nothing
about
you
helen
knows
much
more
than
i
do
jim
cried
the
girl
surely
you
are
going
to
tell
these
women
that
we
are
not
highway
robbers
tell
them
the
truth
tell
them
i
am
not
a
highway
robber
tell
them
that
these
men
are
not
my
accomplices
that
i
never
saw
them
before
you
must
remember
he
replied
in
an
icy
tone
that
i
no
longer
know
your
friends
it
is
some
days
since
you
and
i
parted
company
and
you
must
admit
that
one
of
them
is
a
friend
of
yours
as
well
as
i
can
judge
a
very
close
friend
she
was
almost
in
tears
but
she
persisted
at
least
she
said
you
can
tell
them
that
i
did
not
rob
that
woman
on
the
pass
they
are
going
to
lead
us
in
to
many
glaciers
and
jim
you
wo
let
them
will
you
i
die
of
shame
but
he
was
totally
unmoved
as
aggie
said
afterward
no
one
would
have
thought
that
but
a
day
or
two
before
he
had
been
heartbroken
because
she
was
in
love
with
someone
else
as
to
that
he
said
it
is
questionable
according
to
ostermaier
that
nothing
was
taken
from
you
and
that
as
soon
as
the
attack
was
over
you
basely
deserted
her
and
followed
the
bandits
a
full
description
of
you
which
i
was
able
to
correct
in
one
or
two
trifling
details
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
park
police
she
stared
at
him
with
fury
in
her
eyes
i
hope
you
will
never
speak
to
me
again
she
cried
you
said
that
the
last
time
i
saw
you
helen
if
you
will
think
you
will
remember
that
you
addressed
me
first
just
now
she
stamped
her
foot
of
course
he
said
politely
you
can
see
my
position
you
maintain
and
possibly
believe
that
these
er
acquaintances
of
yours
he
indicated
the
men
are
not
members
of
the
outfit
also
that
your
being
with
them
is
of
an
accidental
nature
but
on
the
other
hand
she
put
her
fingers
in
her
ears
and
turned
her
back
on
him
on
the
other
hand
he
went
on
calmly
i
have
the
word
of
these
three
respectable
ladies
that
they
are
the
outfit
or
part
of
it
that
they
have
just
concluded
a
cruel
hoax
on
unsuspecting
tourists
and
that
they
justly
deserve
to
be
led
in
as
captives
and
exposed
to
the
full
ignominy
of
their
position
here
she
faced
him
again
and
this
time
she
was
quite
pale
ask
those
those
women
where
they
found
my
engagement
ring
she
said
one
of
those
wretches
took
it
from
me
that
ought
to
be
proof
enough
that
they
are
not
from
the
outfit
tish
at
once
produced
the
ring
and
held
it
out
to
him
but
he
merely
glanced
at
it
and
shook
his
head
all
engagement
rings
look
alike
he
observed
i
can
not
possibly
say
helen
but
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
it
is
the
one
i
gave
you
as
you
told
me
you
may
recall
that
you
had
thrown
it
into
a
crack
in
a
glacier
it
may
of
course
be
one
you
have
recently
acquired
he
glanced
at
oliver
but
the
latter
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
she
shed
a
few
tears
but
he
was
adamant
and
helped
us
saddle
the
horses
ignoring
her
utterly
it
was
our
opinion
that
he
no
longer
cared
for
her
and
that
having
lost
him
she
now
regretted
it
i
know
that
she
watched
him
steadily
when
he
was
not
looking
her
way
but
he
went
round
quite
happily
whistling
a
bit
of
tune
and
not
at
all
like
the
surly
individual
we
had
at
first
thought
him
the
ride
back
was
without
much
incident
our
prisoners
rode
with
their
hands
tied
behind
them
except
the
young
lady
we
might
as
well
leave
her
unfastened
the
young
man
said
casually
while
i
dare
say
she
would
make
her
escape
if
possible
and
particularly
if
there
was
any
chance
of
getting
filmed
while
doing
it
i
will
make
myself
personally
responsible
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
exceedingly
rude
to
all
of
us
and
during
our
stop
for
luncheon
which
was
again
bacon
and
pancakes
she
made
a
dash
for
her
horse
the
young
man
saw
her
however
in
time
and
brought
her
back
from
that
time
on
she
was
more
civil
but
i
saw
her
looking
at
him
now
and
then
and
her
eyes
were
positively
terrified
it
was
aggie
at
last
who
put
in
a
plea
for
her
with
him
drawing
him
aside
to
do
so
i
am
sure
she
said
that
she
is
really
a
nice
girl
and
has
merely
been
led
astray
by
the
search
for
adventure
naturally
my
friends
especially
miss
tish
have
small
sympathy
with
such
a
state
of
mind
but
you
are
younger
and
remember
you
loved
her
once
loved
her
once
he
replied
dear
lady
i
so
crazy
about
her
at
this
minute
that
i
can
hardly
hold
myself
in
you
are
not
acting
much
like
it
the
fact
is
he
replied
i
afraid
to
let
myself
go
and
if
learned
a
lesson
i
have
too
i
been
her
doormat
long
enough
i
tried
it
and
it
did
work
she
caring
more
for
me
now
at
this
minute
than
she
has
in
eleven
months
she
needs
a
strong
hand
and
by
george
i
got
it
two
of
them
in
fact
we
reached
many
glaciers
late
that
afternoon
and
tish
rode
right
up
to
the
hotel
our
arrival
created
the
most
intense
excitement
and
tish
although
pleased
was
rather
surprised
it
was
not
however
until
a
large
man
elbowed
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
took
possession
of
the
prisoners
that
we
understood
i
take
them
now
he
said
well
george
how
are
you
this
was
to
the
leader
who
merely
muttered
in
reply
i
like
to
leave
them
here
for
a
short
time
tish
stated
they
should
be
taught
a
severe
lesson
and
nothing
stings
like
ridicule
after
that
you
can
turn
them
free
but
i
think
they
ought
to
be
discharged
turn
them
free
he
said
in
a
tone
of
amazement
discharged
my
dear
madam
they
will
get
fifteen
years
hard
labor
i
hope
and
that
too
good
for
them
then
suddenly
the
crowd
began
to
cheer
it
was
some
time
before
tish
realized
that
they
were
cheering
us
and
even
then
i
shall
have
to
confess
we
did
not
understand
until
the
young
man
explained
to
me
you
see
he
said
i
did
like
to
say
anything
sooner
for
fear
of
making
you
nervous
you
done
it
all
so
well
that
i
wanted
you
to
finish
it
you
been
in
the
right
church
all
along
but
the
wrong
pew
those
fellows
are
movie
actors
except
oliver
who
will
be
freed
now
and
come
after
me
with
a
gun
as
like
as
not
they
real
desperadoes
and
there
a
reward
of
five
thousand
dollars
for
capturing
them
tish
went
rather
white
but
said
nothing
aggie
however
went
into
a
paroxysm
of
sneezing
and
did
not
revive
until
given
aromatic
ammonia
to
inhale
i
was
fooled
at
first
too
the
young
man
said
we
been
expecting
a
holdup
and
when
it
came
we
thought
it
was
the
faked
one
but
the
person
he
paused
and
looked
round
the
person
who
had
the
real
jolt
was
helen
she
followed
them
since
they
did
take
her
for
ransom
as
had
been
agreed
in
the
plot
then
when
she
found
her
mistake
they
took
her
along
for
fear
ride
off
and
raise
the
alarm
all
in
all
he
said
reflectively
it
has
been
worth
about
a
million
dollars
to
me
we
went
into
the
hotel
with
the
crowd
following
us
and
the
first
thing
we
saw
was
ostermaier
sitting
dejectedly
by
the
fire
when
she
saw
us
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
came
to
meet
us
oh
miss
tish
miss
tish
she
said
what
i
have
been
through
attacked
on
a
lonely
and
robbed
of
everything
my
reason
is
almost
gone
and
my
earrings
my
beautiful
earrings
tish
said
nothing
but
reaching
into
her
reticule
which
she
had
taken
from
the
horn
of
her
saddle
she
drew
out
a
number
of
things
here
she
said
are
your
earrings
here
also
is
but
empty
here
is
some
money
too
i
keep
that
however
until
i
know
how
much
you
lost
tish
screeched
ostermaier
you
found
them
yes
tish
said
somewhat
wearily
we
found
them
we
found
a
number
of
things
ostermaier
four
bandits
and
two
lovers
or
rather
three
but
so
no
longer
and
your
things
and
a
reward
of
five
thousand
dollars
and
an
engagement
ring
i
think
she
said
that
i
like
a
hot
bath
and
something
to
eat
ostermaier
was
gloating
over
her
earrings
but
she
looked
up
at
tish
tired
and
grimy
face
at
the
mud
encrusted
on
me
from
my
accident
the
day
before
at
aggie
in
her
turban
go
and
wash
all
of
you
she
said
kindly
and
i
order
some
hot
tea
but
tish
shook
her
head
tea
nothing
she
said
firmly
i
want
a
broiled
sirloin
steak
and
potatoes
and
she
looked
ostermaier
full
in
the
eye
i
am
going
to
have
a
cocktail
i
need
it
late
that
evening
aggie
came
to
tish
room
where
i
was
sitting
with
her
tish
was
feeling
entirely
well
and
more
talkative
than
i
can
remember
her
in
years
but
the
cocktail
which
she
felt
she
said
in
no
other
way
had
gone
to
her
legs
it
is
not
she
observed
that
i
can
not
walk
i
can
perfectly
well
but
i
am
obliged
to
keep
my
eyes
on
my
feet
and
it
might
be
noticed
i
just
came
in
aggie
said
to
say
that
helen
and
her
lover
have
made
it
up
they
are
down
by
the
lake
now
and
if
you
will
look
out
you
can
see
them
i
gave
tish
an
arm
to
the
window
and
the
three
of
us
stood
and
looked
out
the
moon
was
rising
over
the
peaks
across
the
lake
and
against
its
silver
pathway
the
young
people
stood
outlined
as
we
looked
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
but
it
was
a
brief
caress
as
if
he
had
just
remembered
the
strong
hand
and
being
a
doormat
long
enough
tish
drew
a
long
breath
what
she
said
is
more
beautiful
than
young
love
it
will
be
a
comfort
to
remember
that
we
brought
them
together
let
go
of
me
now
lizzie
if
i
keep
my
eye
on
the
bedpost
i
think
i
can
get
back
