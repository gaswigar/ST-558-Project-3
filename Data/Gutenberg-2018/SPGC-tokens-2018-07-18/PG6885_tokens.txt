editor
explanation
charles
derbyshire
who
put
rizal
great
novel
noli
me
tangere
and
its
sequel
el
filibusterismo
into
english
as
the
social
cancer
and
the
reign
of
greed
besides
many
minor
writings
of
the
greatest
man
of
the
brown
race
has
rendered
a
similar
service
for
la
indolencia
de
los
filipinos
in
the
following
pages
and
with
that
same
fidelity
and
sympathetic
comprehension
of
the
author
meaning
which
has
made
possible
an
understanding
of
the
real
rizal
by
english
readers
notes
by
james
robertson
librarian
of
the
philippine
library
and
of
the
series
of
historical
reprints
well
called
the
philippine
islands
so
comprehensive
are
they
show
the
breadth
of
rizal
historical
scholarship
and
that
the
only
error
mentioned
is
due
to
using
a
faulty
reprint
where
the
original
was
not
available
indicates
the
conscientiousness
of
the
pioneer
worker
an
appropriate
setting
has
been
attempted
by
page
decorations
whose
scenes
are
taken
from
philippine
textbooks
of
the
world
book
company
and
whose
borders
were
made
in
the
drawing
department
of
the
philippine
school
of
arts
and
trades
the
frontispiece
shows
a
hurried
pencil
sketch
of
himself
which
rizal
made
in
berlin
in
the
spring
of
that
blumentritt
whom
then
he
knew
only
through
correspondence
might
recognize
him
at
the
leitmeritz
railway
station
when
he
should
arrive
for
a
proposed
visit
the
photograph
from
which
the
engraving
was
reproduced
came
one
year
ago
with
the
christmas
greetings
of
the
austrian
professor
whose
recent
death
the
philippine
islands
who
knew
him
as
their
friend
and
rizal
is
mourning
the
picture
perhaps
deserves
a
couple
of
comments
as
a
child
rizal
had
been
trained
to
rapid
work
an
expertness
kept
up
by
practice
and
the
copying
of
his
own
countenance
from
a
convenient
mirror
was
but
a
moment
task
yet
the
incident
suggests
that
he
did
not
keep
photographs
of
himself
about
and
that
he
had
the
cromwellian
desire
to
see
himself
as
he
really
was
for
the
filipino
features
are
more
prominent
than
in
any
photograph
of
his
extant
the
essay
itself
originally
appeared
in
the
filipino
forthrightly
review
la
solidaridad
of
madrid
in
five
installments
running
from
july
to
september
it
was
a
continuation
of
campaign
of
education
in
which
he
sought
by
blunt
truths
to
awaken
his
countrymen
to
their
own
faults
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
arousing
the
spaniards
to
the
defects
in
spain
colonial
system
that
caused
and
continued
such
shortcomings
there
seems
a
place
in
manila
for
just
suets
missionary
work
as
the
indolence
of
the
filipino
aimed
at
it
may
help
on
the
present
improving
understanding
between
continental
americans
and
their
countrymen
of
these
far
off
eden
isles
for
the
writer
submits
as
his
mature
opinion
based
on
ten
years
acquaintance
among
filipinos
through
studies
which
enlisted
their
interest
that
the
political
problem
would
have
been
greatly
simplified
had
it
been
understood
in
dewey
day
that
among
intelligent
americans
the
lack
of
capacity
referred
to
the
mass
of
the
people
want
of
political
experience
and
not
to
any
alleged
racial
inferiority
to
wounded
pride
has
the
discontent
been
due
rather
than
to
withholding
of
political
privileges
spanish
philippine
history
has
curiously
repeated
itself
during
the
fifteen
years
of
america
administration
of
this
archipelago
just
as
some
colonial
spaniards
seemed
to
the
filipinos
less
creditable
representatives
of
the
metropolis
than
the
average
of
those
who
remained
in
the
peninsula
so
not
all
who
now
pass
for
americans
in
the
philippines
are
believed
here
to
measure
up
to
the
highest
homestandard
sitters
in
underneath
electric
fans
hold
hopeless
the
future
of
the
land
where
men
do
not
desire
to
be
drudges
just
as
did
their
predecessors
who
in
wide
armed
lazy
seats
beneath
punkahs
talked
of
filipino
indolence
ingratitude
as
then
is
the
regular
rejoinder
to
the
progressing
people
protest
against
paternalism
and
altruistic
regard
for
their
real
welfare
is
still
represented
as
the
reason
why
special
legislation
should
be
provided
when
filipinos
prefer
the
same
laws
as
govern
the
sovereign
people
though
those
who
claim
to
champion
the
philippines
cause
apparently
are
unaware
of
it
these
islands
have
a
population
strangely
alike
in
its
make
up
to
the
people
of
america
their
history
is
full
of
american
associations
americans
developed
their
leading
resources
and
american
ideas
have
inspired
their
political
aspirations
it
betrays
blindness
somewhere
that
ever
since
filipinos
have
been
trying
to
get
loose
from
america
in
order
to
set
up
here
an
american
form
of
government
there
seems
now
a
prospect
that
insular
legislation
may
make
available
to
the
individual
the
guarantees
of
personal
liberty
upon
which
america
at
home
prides
itself
that
municipal
and
provincial
autonomy
may
become
realities
in
the
philippines
and
possibly
even
that
both
filipinos
and
americans
may
realize
before
it
is
too
late
how
our
elastic
territorial
government
could
be
made
to
exact
from
them
much
less
of
their
independence
than
the
sacrifice
of
sovereignty
necessary
in
neutralization
or
internationalization
unwillingness
to
work
when
there
is
nothing
in
it
for
them
is
common
to
filipinos
and
americans
for
thomas
jefferson
admitted
that
extravagance
and
indolence
were
the
chief
faults
of
his
countrymen
machinery
has
made
the
fruits
of
americans
labors
in
their
land
of
abundance
afford
a
luxury
in
living
not
elsewhere
existing
but
the
filipino
in
his
rich
and
not
home
shutting
out
as
we
do
oriental
cheap
labor
may
employ
american
machinery
and
attain
the
same
standard
the
possibilities
for
the
prosperity
of
the
population
put
the
philippines
in
the
new
world
just
as
their
discovery
and
their
history
group
them
with
the
western
hemisphere
austin
craig
university
of
the
philippines
manila
december
i
doctor
sancianco
in
his
progreso
de
filipinas
has
taken
up
this
question
agitated
as
he
calls
it
and
relying
upon
facts
and
reports
furnished
by
the
very
same
spanish
authorities
that
rule
the
philippines
has
demonstrated
that
such
indolence
does
not
exist
and
that
all
said
about
it
does
not
deserve
reply
or
even
passing
notice
nevertheless
as
discussion
of
it
has
been
continued
not
only
by
government
employees
who
make
it
responsible
for
their
own
shortcomings
not
only
by
the
friars
who
regard
it
as
necessary
in
order
that
they
may
continue
to
represent
themselves
as
indispensable
but
also
by
serious
and
disinterested
persons
and
as
evidence
of
greater
or
less
weight
may
be
adduced
in
opposition
to
that
which
sancianco
cites
it
seems
expedient
to
us
to
study
this
question
thoroughly
without
superciliousness
or
sensitiveness
without
prejudice
without
pessimism
and
as
we
can
only
serve
our
country
by
telling
the
truth
however
bit
tee
it
be
just
as
a
flat
and
skilful
negation
can
not
refute
a
real
and
positive
fact
in
spite
of
the
brilliance
of
the
arguments
as
a
mere
affirmation
is
not
sufficient
to
create
something
impossible
let
us
calmly
examine
the
facts
using
on
our
part
all
the
impartiality
of
which
a
man
is
capable
who
is
convinced
that
there
is
no
redemption
except
upon
solid
bases
of
virtue
the
word
indolence
has
been
greatly
misused
in
the
sense
of
little
love
for
work
and
lack
of
energy
while
ridicule
has
concealed
the
misuse
this
question
has
met
with
the
same
fate
as
certain
panaceas
and
specifies
of
the
quacks
who
by
ascribing
to
them
impossible
virtues
have
discredited
them
in
the
middle
ages
and
even
in
some
catholic
countries
now
the
devil
is
blamed
for
everything
that
superstitious
folk
can
not
understand
or
the
perversity
of
mankind
is
loath
to
confess
in
the
philippines
one
own
and
another
faults
the
shortcomings
of
one
the
misdeeds
of
another
are
attributed
to
indolence
and
just
as
in
the
middle
ages
he
who
sought
the
explanation
of
phenomena
outside
of
infernal
influences
was
persecuted
so
in
the
philippines
worse
happens
to
him
who
seeks
the
origin
of
the
trouble
outside
of
accepted
beliefs
the
consequence
of
this
misuse
is
that
there
are
some
who
are
interested
in
stating
it
as
a
dogma
and
others
in
combating
it
as
a
ridiculous
superstition
if
not
a
punishable
delusion
yet
it
is
not
to
be
inferred
from
the
misuse
of
a
thing
that
it
does
not
exist
we
think
that
there
must
be
something
behind
all
this
outcry
for
it
is
incredible
that
so
many
should
err
among
whom
we
have
said
there
are
a
lot
of
serious
and
disinterested
persons
some
act
in
bad
faith
through
levity
through
want
of
sound
judgment
through
limitation
in
reasoning
power
ignorance
of
the
past
or
other
cause
some
repeat
what
they
have
heard
without
examination
or
reflection
others
speak
through
pessimism
or
are
impelled
by
that
human
characteristic
which
paints
as
perfect
everything
that
belongs
to
oneself
and
defective
whatever
belongs
to
another
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
there
are
some
who
worship
truth
or
if
not
truth
itself
at
least
the
semblance
thereof
which
is
truth
in
the
mind
of
the
crowd
examining
well
then
all
the
scenes
and
all
the
men
that
we
have
known
from
childhood
and
the
life
of
our
country
we
believe
that
indolence
does
exist
there
the
filipinos
who
can
measure
up
with
the
most
active
peoples
in
the
world
will
doubtless
not
repudiate
this
admission
for
it
is
true
that
there
one
works
and
struggles
against
the
climate
against
nature
and
against
men
but
we
must
not
take
the
exception
for
the
general
rule
and
should
rather
seek
the
good
of
our
country
by
stating
what
we
believe
to
be
true
we
must
confess
that
indolence
does
actually
and
positively
exist
there
only
that
instead
of
holding
it
to
be
the
cause
of
the
backwardness
and
the
trouble
we
regard
it
as
the
effect
of
the
trouble
and
the
backwardness
by
fostering
the
development
of
a
lamentable
predisposition
those
who
have
as
yet
treated
of
indolence
with
the
exception
of
sancianco
have
been
content
to
deny
or
affirm
it
we
know
of
no
one
who
has
studied
its
causes
nevertheless
those
who
admit
its
existence
and
exaggerate
it
more
or
less
have
not
therefore
failed
to
advise
remedies
taken
from
here
and
there
from
java
from
india
from
other
english
or
dutch
colonies
like
the
quack
who
saw
a
fever
cured
with
a
dozen
sardines
and
afterwards
always
prescribed
these
fish
at
every
rise
in
temperature
that
he
discovered
in
his
patients
we
shall
proceed
otherwise
before
proposing
a
remedy
we
shall
examine
the
causes
and
even
though
strictly
speaking
a
predisposition
is
not
a
cause
let
us
however
study
at
its
true
value
this
predisposition
due
to
nature
the
predisposition
exists
why
should
it
a
hot
climate
requires
of
the
individual
quiet
and
rest
just
as
cold
incites
to
labor
and
action
for
this
reason
the
spaniard
is
more
indolent
than
the
frenchman
the
frenchman
more
so
than
the
german
the
europeans
themselves
who
reproach
the
residents
of
the
colonies
so
much
and
i
am
not
now
speaking
of
the
spaniards
but
of
the
germans
and
english
themselves
how
do
they
live
in
tropical
countries
surrounded
by
a
numerous
train
of
servants
never
going
afoot
but
riding
in
a
carriage
needing
servants
not
only
to
take
off
their
shoes
for
them
but
even
to
fan
them
and
yet
they
live
and
eat
better
they
work
for
themselves
to
get
rich
with
the
hope
of
a
future
free
and
respected
while
the
poor
colonist
the
indolent
colonist
is
badly
nourished
has
no
hope
toils
for
others
and
works
under
force
and
compulsion
perhaps
the
reply
to
this
will
be
that
white
men
are
not
made
to
stand
the
severity
of
the
climate
a
mistake
a
man
can
live
in
any
climate
if
he
will
only
adapt
himself
to
its
requirements
and
conditions
what
kills
the
european
in
hot
countries
is
the
abuse
of
liquors
the
attempt
to
live
according
to
the
nature
of
his
own
country
under
another
sky
and
another
sun
we
inhabitants
of
hot
countries
live
well
in
northern
europe
whenever
we
take
the
precautions
the
people
there
do
europeans
can
also
stand
the
torrid
zone
if
only
they
would
get
rid
of
their
prejudices
the
fact
is
that
in
tropical
countries
violent
work
is
not
a
good
thing
as
it
is
in
cold
countries
there
it
is
death
destruction
annihilation
nature
knows
this
and
like
a
just
mother
has
therefore
made
the
earth
more
fertile
more
productive
as
a
compensation
an
hour
work
under
that
burning
sun
in
the
midst
of
pernicious
influences
springing
from
nature
in
activity
is
equal
to
a
work
in
a
temperate
climate
it
is
then
just
that
the
earth
yield
a
hundred
fold
moreover
do
we
not
see
the
active
european
who
has
gained
strength
during
the
winter
who
feels
the
fresh
blood
of
spring
boil
in
his
veins
do
we
not
see
him
abandon
his
labors
during
the
few
days
of
his
variable
summer
close
his
office
where
the
work
is
not
violent
and
amounts
for
many
to
talking
and
gesticulating
in
the
shade
and
beside
a
flee
to
watering
places
sit
in
the
cafés
or
stroll
about
what
wonder
then
that
the
inhabitant
of
tropical
countries
worm
out
and
with
his
blood
thinned
by
the
continuous
and
excessive
heat
is
reduced
to
inaction
who
is
the
indolent
one
in
the
manila
offices
is
it
the
poor
clerk
who
comes
in
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
leaves
at
one
in
the
afternoon
with
only
his
parasol
who
copies
and
writes
and
works
for
himself
and
for
his
chief
or
is
it
the
chief
who
comes
in
a
carriage
at
ten
leaves
before
twelve
reads
his
newspaper
while
smoking
and
with
is
feet
cocked
up
on
a
chair
or
a
table
or
gossiping
about
all
his
friends
which
is
indolent
the
native
coadjutor
poorly
paid
and
badly
treated
who
has
to
visit
all
the
indigent
sick
living
in
the
country
or
the
friar
curate
who
gets
fabulously
rich
goes
about
in
a
carriage
eats
and
drinks
well
and
does
not
put
himself
to
any
trouble
without
collecting
excessive
fees
without
speaking
further
of
the
europeans
in
what
violent
labor
does
the
chinaman
engage
in
tropical
countries
the
industrious
chinaman
who
flees
from
his
own
country
driven
by
hunger
and
want
and
whose
whole
ambition
is
to
amass
a
small
fortune
with
the
exception
of
some
porters
an
occupation
that
the
natives
also
follow
he
nearly
always
engages
in
trade
in
commerce
so
rarely
does
he
take
up
agriculture
that
we
do
not
know
of
a
single
case
the
chinaman
who
in
other
colonies
cultivates
the
soil
does
so
only
for
a
certain
number
of
years
and
then
retires
we
find
then
the
tendency
to
indolence
very
natural
and
have
to
admit
and
bless
it
for
we
can
not
alter
natural
laws
and
without
it
the
race
would
have
disappeared
man
is
not
a
brute
he
is
not
a
machine
his
object
is
not
merely
to
produce
in
spite
of
the
pretensions
of
some
christian
whites
who
would
make
of
the
colored
christian
a
kind
of
motive
power
somewhat
more
intelligent
and
less
costly
than
steam
man
object
is
not
to
satisfy
tile
passions
of
another
man
his
object
is
to
seek
happiness
for
himself
and
his
kind
by
traveling
along
the
road
of
progress
and
perfection
the
evil
is
not
that
indolence
exists
more
or
less
latently
but
that
it
is
fostered
and
magnified
among
men
as
well
as
among
nations
there
exist
not
only
aptitudes
but
also
tendencies
toward
good
and
evil
to
foster
the
good
ones
and
aid
them
as
well
as
correct
the
evil
and
repress
them
would
be
the
duty
of
society
and
governments
if
less
noble
thoughts
did
not
occupy
their
attention
the
evil
is
that
the
indolence
in
the
philippines
is
a
magnified
indolence
an
indolence
of
the
snowball
type
if
we
may
be
permitted
the
expression
an
evil
that
increases
in
direct
proportion
to
the
square
of
the
periods
of
time
an
effect
of
misgovernment
and
of
backwardness
as
we
said
and
not
a
cause
thereof
others
will
hold
the
contrary
opinion
especially
those
who
have
a
hand
in
the
misgovernment
but
we
do
not
care
we
have
made
an
assertion
and
are
going
to
prove
it
ii
when
in
consequence
of
a
long
chronic
illness
the
condition
of
the
patient
is
examined
the
question
may
arise
whether
the
weakening
of
the
fibers
and
the
debility
of
the
organs
are
the
cause
of
the
malady
continuing
or
the
effect
of
the
bad
treatment
that
prolongs
its
action
the
attending
physician
attributes
the
entire
failure
of
his
skill
to
the
poor
constitution
of
the
patient
to
the
climate
to
the
surroundings
and
so
on
on
the
other
hand
the
patient
attributes
the
aggravation
of
the
evil
to
the
system
of
treatment
followed
only
the
common
crowd
the
inquisitive
populace
shakes
its
head
and
can
not
reach
a
decision
something
like
this
happens
in
the
case
of
the
philippines
instead
of
physician
read
government
that
is
friars
employees
etc
instead
of
patient
philippines
instead
of
malady
indolence
and
just
as
happens
in
similar
cases
then
the
patient
gets
worse
everybody
loses
his
head
each
one
dodges
the
responsibility
to
place
it
upon
somebody
else
and
instead
of
seeking
the
causes
in
order
to
combat
the
evil
in
them
devotes
himself
at
best
to
attacking
the
symptoms
here
a
a
tax
there
a
plaster
forced
labor
further
on
a
sedative
a
trifling
reform
every
new
arrival
proposes
a
new
remedy
one
seasons
of
prayer
the
relics
of
a
saint
the
viaticum
the
friars
another
a
still
another
with
pretensions
to
modern
ideas
a
transfusion
of
blood
it
nothing
only
the
patient
has
eight
million
indolent
red
corpuscles
some
few
white
corpuscles
in
the
form
of
an
agricultural
colony
will
get
us
out
of
the
trouble
so
on
all
sides
there
are
groans
gnawing
of
lips
clenching
of
fists
many
hollow
words
great
ignorance
a
deal
of
talk
a
lot
of
fear
the
patient
is
near
his
finish
yes
transfusion
of
blood
transfusion
of
blood
new
life
new
vitality
yes
the
new
white
corpuscles
that
you
are
going
to
inject
into
its
veins
the
new
white
corpuscles
that
were
a
cancer
in
another
organism
will
withstand
all
the
depravity
of
the
system
will
withstand
the
that
it
suffers
every
day
will
have
more
stamina
than
all
the
eight
million
red
corpuscles
will
cure
all
the
disorders
all
the
degeneration
all
the
trouble
in
the
principal
organs
be
thankful
if
they
do
not
become
coagulations
and
produce
gangrene
be
thankful
if
they
do
not
reproduce
the
cancer
while
the
patient
breathes
we
must
not
lose
hope
and
however
late
we
be
a
judicious
examination
is
never
superfluous
at
least
the
cause
of
death
may
be
known
we
are
not
trying
to
put
all
the
blame
on
the
physician
and
still
less
on
the
patient
for
we
have
already
spoken
of
a
predisposition
due
to
the
climate
a
reasonable
and
natural
predisposition
in
the
absence
of
which
the
race
would
disappear
sacrificed
to
excessive
labor
in
a
tropical
country
indolence
in
the
philippines
is
a
chronic
malady
but
not
a
hereditary
one
the
filipinos
have
not
always
been
what
they
are
witnesses
whereto
are
all
the
historians
of
the
first
years
after
the
discovery
of
the
islands
before
the
arrival
of
the
europeans
the
malayan
filipinos
carried
on
an
active
trade
not
only
among
themselves
but
also
with
all
the
neighboring
countries
a
chinese
manuscript
of
the
century
translated
by
hirth
globus
which
we
will
take
up
at
another
time
speaks
of
china
relations
with
the
islands
relations
purely
commercial
in
which
mention
is
made
of
the
activity
and
honesty
of
the
traders
of
luzon
who
took
the
chinese
products
and
distributed
them
throughout
all
the
islands
traveling
for
nine
months
and
then
returned
to
pay
religiously
even
for
the
merchandise
that
the
chinamen
did
not
remember
to
have
given
them
the
products
which
they
in
exchange
exported
from
the
islands
were
crude
wax
cotton
pearls
etc
the
first
thing
noticed
by
pigafetta
who
came
with
magellan
in
on
arriving
at
the
first
island
of
the
philippines
samar
was
the
courtesy
and
kindness
of
the
inhabitants
and
their
commerce
to
honor
our
captain
he
says
they
conducted
him
to
their
boats
where
they
had
their
merchandise
which
consisted
of
cloves
cinnamon
pepper
nutmegs
mace
gold
and
other
things
and
they
made
us
understand
by
gestures
that
such
articles
were
to
be
found
in
the
islands
to
which
we
were
going
further
on
he
speaks
of
the
vessels
and
utensils
of
solid
gold
that
he
found
in
butuan
where
the
people
worked
mines
he
describes
the
silk
dresses
the
daggers
with
long
gold
hilts
and
scabbards
of
carved
wood
the
gold
sets
of
teeth
etc
among
cereals
and
fruits
he
mentions
rice
millet
oranges
lemons
panicum
etc
that
the
islands
maintained
relations
with
neighboring
countries
and
even
with
distant
ones
is
proven
by
the
ships
from
siam
laden
with
gold
and
slaves
that
magellan
found
in
cebu
these
ships
paid
certain
duties
to
the
king
of
the
island
in
the
same
year
the
survivors
of
magellan
expedition
met
the
son
of
the
rajah
of
luzon
who
as
of
the
sultan
of
borneo
and
admiral
of
his
fleet
had
conquered
for
him
the
great
city
of
lave
sarawak
might
this
captain
who
was
greatly
feared
by
all
his
foes
have
been
the
rajah
matanda
whom
the
spaniards
afterwards
encountered
in
tondo
in
in
the
warriors
of
luzon
took
part
in

formidable
contests
of

wealth
abounded
in
the
islands
pigafetta
tells
us
of
the
abundance
of
foodstuffs
in
paragua
and
of
its
inhabitants
who
nearly
all
tilled
their
own
fields
at
this
island
the
survivors
of
expedition
were
well
received
and
provisioned
a
little
later
these
same
survivors
captured
a
vessel
plundered
and
sacked
it
add
took
prisoner
in
it
the
chief
of
the
island
of
paragua
with
his
son
and
brother
in
this
same
vessel
they
captured
bronze
lombards
and
this
is
the
first
mention
of
artillery
of
the
filipinos
for
these
lombards
were
useful
to
the
chief
of
paragua
against
the
savages
of
the
interior
they
let
him
ransom
himself
within
seven
days
demanding
measures
cavanes
of
rice
pigs
goats
and
chickens
this
is
the
first
act
of
piracy
recorded
in
philippine
history
the
chief
of
paragua
paid
everything
and
moreover
voluntarily
added
coconuts
bananas
and
jars
filled
with
when
caesar
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
corsairs
and
required
to
pay
twenty
five
talents
ransom
he
replied
i
give
you
fifty
but
later
have
you
all
crucified
the
chief
of
paragua
was
more
generous
he
forgot
his
conduct
while
it
may
reveal
weakness
also
demonstrates
that
the
islands
were
abundantly
provisioned
this
chief
was
named

mahamud
his
brother
guantil
and
his
son
tuan
mahamed
martin

purser
of
the
ship
victoria
archivos
de
indias
a
very
extraordinary
thing
and
one
that
shows
the
facility
with
which
the
natives
learned
spanish
is
that
fifty
years
before
the
arrival
of
the
spaniards
in
luzon
in
that
very
year
when
they
first
came
to
the
islands
there
were
already
natives
of
luzon
who
understood
castilian
in
the
treaties
of
peace
that
the
survivors
of
magellan
expedition
made
with
the
chief
of
paragua
when
the
died
they
communicated
with
one
another
through
a
moro
who
had
been
captured
in
the
island
of
the
king
of
luzon
and
who
understood
some
spanish
martin

where
did
this
extemporaneous
interpreter
learn
castilian
in
the
moluccas
in
malacca
with
the
portuguese
spaniards
did
not
reach
luzon
until
legazpi
expedition
met
in
butuan
various
traders
of
luzon
with
their
boats
laden
with
iron
wax
cloths

etc
gaspar

plenty
of
provisions
activity
trade
movement
in
all
the
southern
islands
they
arrived
at
the
island
of
cebu
abounding
in
provisions
with
mines
and
washings
of
gold
and
peopled
with
natives
as
morga
says
very
populous
and
at
a
port
frequented
by
many
ships
that
came
from
the
islands
and
kingdoms
near
india
as
colin
says
and
even
though
they
were
peacefully
received
discord
soon
arose
the
city
was
taken
by
force
and
burned
the
fire
destroyed
the
food
supplies
and
naturally
famine
broke
out
in
that
town
of
a
hundred
thousand
people
as
the
historians
say
and
among
the
members
of
the
expedition
but
the
neighboring
islands
quickly
relieved
the
need
thanks
to
the
abundance
they
enjoyed
all
the
histories
of
those
first
years
in
short
abound
in
long
accounts
about
the
industry
and
agriculture
of
the
natives
mines
looms
farms
barter
naval
construction
raising
of
poultry
and
stock
weaving
of
silk
and
cotton
distilleries
manufactures
of
arms
pearl
fisheries
the
civet
industry
the
horn
and
hide
industry
are
things
encountered
at
every
step
and
considering
the
time
and
the
conditions
in
the
islands
prove
that
there
was
life
there
was
activity
there
was
movement
and
if
this
which
is
deduction
does
not
convince
any
minds
imbued
with
unfair
prejudices
perhaps
of
some
avail
may
be
the
testimony
of
the
morga
who
was
of
manila
for
seven
years
and
after
rendering
great
service
in
the
archipelago
was
appointed
criminal
judge
of
the
audiencia
of
mexico
and
counsellor
of
the
inquisition
his
testimony
we
say
is
highly
credible
not
only
because
all
his
contemporaries
have
spoken
of
him
in
terms
that
border
on
veneration
but
also
because
his
work
from
which
we
take
these
citations
is
written
with
great
circumspection
and
care
as
well
with
reference
to
the
authorities
in
the
philippines
as
to
the
errors
they
committed
the
natives
says
morga
in
chapter
vii
speaking
of
the
occupations
of
the
chinese
are
very
far
from
exercising
those
trades
and
have
even
forgotten
much
about
farming
raising
poultry
stock
and
cotton
and
weaving
cloth
as
they
used
to
do
in
their
paganism
and
for
a
long
time
after
the
country
was
conquered
the
whole
of
chapter
viii
of
his
work
deals
with
this
moribund
activity
this
industry
and
yet
in
spite
of
that
how
long
is
his
eighth
chapter
and
not
only
morga
not
only
chirino
colin
argensola
gaspar
de
san
agustin
and
others
agree
in
this
matter
but
modern
travelers
after
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
examining
the
decadence
and
misery
assert
the
same
thing
hans
meyer
when
he
saw
the
unsubdued
tribes
cultivating
beautiful
fields
and
working
energetically
asked
if
they
would
not
become
indolent
when
they
in
turn
should
accept
christianity
and
a
paternal
government
accordingly
the
filipinos
in
spite
of
the
climate
in
spite
of
their
few
needs
they
were
less
then
than
now
were
not
the
indolent
creatures
of
our
time
and
as
we
shall
see
later
on
their
ethics
and
their
mode
of
life
were
not
what
is
now
complacently
attributed
to
them
how
then
and
in
what
way
was
that
active
and
enterprising
infidel
native
of
ancient
times
converted
into
the
lazy
and
indolent
christian
as
our
contemporary
writer
say
we
have
already
spoken
of
the
more
or
less
latent
predisposition
which
exists
in
the
philippines
toward
indolence
and
which
must
exist
everywhere
in
the
whole
world
in
all
men
because
we
all
hate
work
more
or
less
as
it
may
be
more
or
less
hard
more
or
less
unproductive
the
dolce
far
niente
of
the
italian
the
rascarse
la
barriga
of
the
spaniard
the
supreme
aspiration
of
the
bourgeois
to
live
on
his
income
in
peace
and
tranquility
attest
this
what
causes
operated
to
awake
this
terrible
predisposition
from
its
lethargy
how
is
it
that
the
filipino
people
so
fond
of
its
customs
as
to
border
on
routine
has
given
up
its
ancient
habits
of
work
of
trade
of
navigation
even
to
the
extent
of
completely
forgetting
its
past
iii
a
fatal
combination
of
circumstances
some
independent
of
the
will
in
spite
of
men
efforts
others
the
offspring
of
stupidity
and
ignorance
others
the
inevitable
corollaries
of
false
principles
and
still
others
the
result
of
more
or
less
base
passions
has
induced
the
decline
of
labor
an
evil
which
instead
of
being
remedied
by
prudence
mature
reflection
and
recognition
of
the
mistakes
made
through
deplorable
policy
through
regret
table
blindness
and
obstinacy
has
gone
from
bad
to
worse
until
it
has
reached
the
condition
in
which
we
now
see
it
first
came
the
wars
the
internal
disorders
which
the
new
change
of
affairs
naturally
brought
with
it
it
was
necessary
to
subject
the
people
either
by
cajolery
or
force
there
were
fights
there
was
slaughter
those
who
had
submitted
peacefully
seemed
to
repent
of
it
insurrections
were
suspected
and
some
occurred
naturally
there
were
executions
and
many
capable
laborers
perished
add
to
this
condition
of
disorder
the
invasion
of
limahong
add
the
continual
wars
into
which
the
inhabitants
of
the
philippines
were
plunged
to
maintain
the
honor
of
spain
to
extend
the
sway
of
her
flag
in
borneo
in
the
moluccas
and
in
to
repel
the
dutch
foe
costly
wars
fruitless
expeditions
in
which
each
time
thousands
and
thousands
of
native
archers
and
rowers
were
recorded
to
have
embarked
but
whether
they
returned
to
their
homes
was
never
stated
like
the
tribute
that
once
upon
a
time
greece
sent
to
the
minotaur
of
crete
the
philippine
youth
embarked
for
the
expedition
saying
to
their
country
forever
on
their
horizon
were
the
stormy
sea
the
interminable
wars
the
rash
expeditions
wherefore
gaspar
de
san
agustin
says
although
anciently
there
were
in
this
town
of
dumangas
many
people
in
the
course
of
time
they
have
very
greatly
diminished
because
the
natives
are
the
best
sailors
and
most
skillful
rowers
on
the
whole
coast
and
so
the
governors
in
the
port
of
iloilo
take
most
of
the
people
from
this
town
for
the
ships
that
they
send
abroad
when
the
spaniards
reached
this
island
panay
it
is
said
that
there
were
on
it
more
than
fifty
thousand
families
but
these
diminished
greatly
and
at
present
they
may
amount
to
some
fourteen
thousand
tributaries
from
fifty
thousand
families
to
fourteen
thousand
tributaries
in
little
over
half
a
century
we
would
never
get
through
had
we
to
quote
all
the
evidence
of
the
authors
regarding
the
frightful
diminution
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
philippines
in
the
first
years
after
the
discovery
in
the
time
of
their
first
bishop
that
is
ten
years
after
legazpi
philip
ii
said
that
they
had
been
reduced
to
less
than
two
thirds
add
to
these
fatal
expeditions
that
wasted
all
the
moral
and
material
energies
of
the
country
the
frightful
inroads
of
the
terrible
pirates
from
the
south
instigated
and
encouraged
by
the
government
first
in
order
to
get
complaint
and
afterwards
disarm
the
islands
subjected
to
it
inroads
that
reached
the
very
shores
of
manila
even
malate
itself
and
during
which
were
seen
to
set
out
for
captivity
and
slavery
in
the
baleful
glow
of
burning
villages
strings
of
wretches
who
had
been
unable
to
defend
themselves
leaving
behind
them
the
ashes
of
their
homes
and
the
corpses
of
their
parents
and
children
morga
who
recounts
the
first
piratical
invasion
says
the
boldness
of
these
people
of
mindanao
did
great
damage
to
the
visayan
islands
as
much
by
what
they
did
in
them
as
by
the
fear
and
fright
which
the
native
acquired
because
the
latter
were
in
the
power
of
the
spaniards
who
held
them
subject
and
tributary
and
unarmed
in
such
manner
that
they
did
not
protect
them
from
their
enemies
or
leave
them
means
with
which
to
defend
themselves
as
they
did
when
there
were
no
spaniards
in
the
country
these
piratical
attacks
continually
reduced
the
number
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
philippines
since
the
independent
malays
were
especially
notorious
for
their
atrocities
and
murders
sometimes
because
they
believed
that
to
preserve
their
independence
it
was
necessary
to
weaken
the
spaniard
by
reducing
the
number
of
his
subjects
sometimes
because
a
greater
hatred
and
a
deeper
resentment
inspired
them
against
the
christian
filipinos
who
being
of
the
their
own
race
served
the
stranger
in
order
to
deprive
them
of
their
precious
liberty
these
expeditions
lasted
about
three
centuries
being
repeated
five
and
ten
times
a
year
and
each
expedition
cost
the
islands
over
eight
hundred
prisoners
with
the
invasions
of
the
pirates
from
sulu
and
mindanao
says
padre
gaspar
de
san
agustin
the
island
of
bantayan
near
cebu
has
been
greatly
reduced
because
they
easily
captured
the
people
there
since
the
latter
had
no
place
to
fortify
themselves
and
were
far
from
help
from
cebu
the
hostile
sulu
did
great
damage
in
this
island
in
leaving
it
almost
depopulated
page
these
rough
attacks
coming
from
without
produced
a
counter
effect
in
the
interior
which
carrying
out
medical
comparisons
was
like
a
purge
or
diet
in
an
individual
who
has
just
lost
a
great
deal
of
blood
in
order
to
make
headway
against
so
many
calamities
to
secure
their
sovereignty
and
take
the
offensive
in
these
disastrous
contests
to
isolate
the
warlike
sulus
from
their
neighbors
in
the
south
to
care
for
the
needs
of
the
empire
of
the
indies
for
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
philippines
were
kept
as
contemporary
documents
prove
was
their
strategic
position
between
new
spain
and
the
indies
to
wrest
from
the
dutch
their
growing
colonies
of
the
moluccas
and
get
rid
of
some
troublesome
neighbors
to
maintain
in
short
the
trade
of
china
with
new
spain
it
was
necessary
to
construct
new
and
large
ships
which
as
we
have
seen
costly
as
they
were
to
the
country
for
their
equipment
and
the
rowers
they
required
were
not
less
so
because
of
the
manner
in
which
they
were
constructed
fernando
de
los
rios
coronel
who
fought
in
these
wars
and
later
turned
priest
speaking
of
these
king
ships
said
as
they
were
so
large
the
timber
needed
was
scarcely
to
be
found
in
the
forests
of
the
philippines
and
thus
it
was
necessary
to
seek
it
with
great
difficulty
in
the
most
remote
of
them
where
once
found
in
order
to
haul
and
convey
it
to
the
shipyard
the
towns
of
the
surrounding
country
had
to
be
depopulated
of
natives
who
get
it
out
with
immense
labor
damage
and
cost
to
them
the
natives
furnished
the
masts
for
a
galleon
according
to
the
assertion
of
the
franciscans
and
i
heard
the
governor
of
the
province
where
they
were
cut
which
is
lacuna
de
bay
say
that
to
haul
them
seven
leagues
over
very
broken
mountains
natives
were
engaged
three
months
without
furnishing
them
food
which
the
wretched
native
had
to
seek
for
himself
and
gaspar
de
san
agustin
says
in
those
times
bacolor
has
not
the
people
that
it
had
in
the
past
because
of
the
uprising
in
that
province
when
don
sabiniano
manrique
de
lava
was
governor
of
these
islands
and
because
of
the
continual
labor
of
cutting
timber
for
his
majesty
shipyards
which
hinders
them
from
cultivating
the
very
fertile
plain
they
have
if
this
is
not
sufficient
to
explain
the
depopulation
of
the
islands
and
the
abandonment
of
industry
agriculture
and
commerce
then
add
the
natives
who
wore
executed
those
who
loft
their
wives
and
children
and
fled
in
disgust
to
the
mountains
those
who
were
sold
into
slavery
to
pay
the
taxes
levied
upon
them
as
fernando
de
los
rios
coronel
says
add
to
all
this
what
philip
ii
said
in
reprimanding
bishos
salazar
about
natives
sold
by
some
encomendoros
to
others
those
flogged
to
death
the
women
who
are
crushed
to
death
by
their
heavy
burdens
those
who
sleep
in
the
fields
and
there
bear
and
nurse
their
children
and
die
bitten
by
poisonous
vermin
the
many
who
are
executed
and
left
to
die
of
hunger
and
those
who
eat
poisonous
herbs
and
the
mothers
who
kill
their
children
in
bearing
them
and
you
will
understand
how
in
less
than
thirty
years
the
population
of
the
philippines
was
reduced
we
are
not
saying
this
it
was
said
by
gaspar
de
san
agustin
the
preeminently
augustinian
and
he
confirms
it
throughout
the
rest
of
his
work
by
speaking
every
moment
of
the
state
of
neglect
in
which
lay
the
farms
and
fields
once
so
flourishing
and
so
well
cultivated
the
towns
thinned
that
had
formerly
been
inhabited
by
many
leading
families
how
is
it
strange
then
that
discouragement
may
have
been
infused
into
the
spirit
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
philippines
when
in
the
midst
of
so
many
calamities
they
did
not
know
whether
they
would
see
sprout
the
seed
they
were
planting
whether
their
field
was
going
to
be
their
grave
or
their
crop
would
go
to
feed
their
executioner
what
is
there
strange
in
it
when
we
see
the
pious
but
impotent
friars
of
that
time
trying
to
free
their
poor
parishioners
from
the
tyranny
of
the
encomenderos
by
advising
them
to
stop
work
in
the
mines
to
abandon
their
commerce
to
break
up
their
looms
pointing
out
to
them
heaven
for
their
whole
hope
preparing
them
for
death
as
their
only
consolation
man
works
for
an
object
remove
the
object
and
you
reduce
him
to
inaction
the
most
active
man
in
the
world
will
fold
his
arms
from
the
instant
he
understands
that
it
is
madness
to
bestir
himself
that
this
work
will
be
the
cause
of
his
trouble
that
for
him
it
will
be
the
cause
of
vexations
at
home
and
of
the
pirate
greed
abroad
it
seems
that
these
thoughts
have
never
entered
the
minds
of
those
who
cry
out
against
the
indolence
of
the
filipinos
even
were
the
filipino
not
a
man
like
the
rest
even
were
we
to
suppose
that
zeal
in
him
for
work
was
as
essential
as
the
movement
of
a
wheel
caught
in
the
gearing
of
others
in
motion
even
were
we
to
deny
him
foresight
and
the
judgment
that
the
past
and
the
present
form
there
would
still
be
left
us
another
reason
to
explain
the
attack
of
the
evil
the
abandonment
of
the
fields
by
their
cultivators
whom
the
wars
and
piratical
attacks
dragged
from
their
homes
was
sufficient
to
reduce
to
nothing
the
hard
labor
of
so
many
generations
in
the
philippines
abandon
for
a
year
the
land
most
beautifully
tended
and
you
will
see
how
you
will
have
to
begin
all
over
again
the
rain
will
wipe
out
the
furrows
the
floods
will
drown
the
seeds
plants
and
bushes
will
grow
up
everywhere
and
on
seeing
so
much
useless
labor
the
hand
will
drop
the
hoe
the
laborer
will
desert
his
plow
there
left
the
fine
life
of
the
pirate
thus
is
understood
that
sad
discouragement
which
we
find
in
the
friar
writers
of
the
century
speaking
of
once
very
fertile
plains
submerged
of
provinces
and
towns
depopulated
of
products
that
have
disappeared
from
trade
of
leading
families
exterminated
these
pages
resemble
a
sad
and
monotonous
scene
in
the
night
after
a
lively
day
of
cagayan
padre
san
agustin
speaks
with
mournful
brevity
a
great
deal
of
cotton
of
which
they
made
good
cloth
that
the
chinese
and
japanese
every
year
bought
and
carried
away
in
the
time
the
industry
and
the
trade
had
come
to
an
end
it
seems
that
these
are
causes
more
thorn
sufficient
to
breed
indolence
even
in
the
midst
of
beehive
thus
is
explained
why
after
years
of
the
system
the
circumspect
and
prudent
morga
said
that
the
natives
have
forgotten
much
about
farming
raising
poultry
stock
and
cotton
and
weaving
cloth
as
they
used
to
do
in
their
paganism
and
for
a
long
time
after
the
country
had
been
conquered
still
they
struggled
a
long
time
against
indolence
yes
but
their
enemies
were
so
numerous
that
at
last
they
gave
up
iv
we
recognize
the
causes
that
awoke
the
predisposition
and
provoked
the
evil
now
let
us
see
what
foster
and
sustain
it
in
this
connection
government
and
governed
have
to
bow
our
heads
and
say
we
deserve
our
fate
we
have
already
truly
said
that
when
a
house
becomes
disturbed
and
disordered
we
should
not
accuse
the
youngest
child
or
the
servants
but
the
head
of
it
especially
if
his
authority
is
unlimited
he
who
does
not
act
freely
is
not
responsible
for
his
actions
and
the
filipino
people
not
being
master
of
its
liberty
is
not
responsible
for
either
its
misfortunes
or
its
woes
we
says
this
it
is
true
but
as
will
be
seen
later
on
we
also
have
a
large
part
in
the
continuation
of
such
a
disorder
the
following
among
other
causes
contributed
to
foster
the
evil
and
aggravate
it
the
constantly
lessening
encouragement
that
labor
has
met
with
in
the
philippines
fearing
to
have
the
filipinos
deal
frequently
with
other
individuals
of
their
own
race
who
were
free
and
independent
as
the
borneans
the
siamese
the
cambodians
and
the
japanese
people
who
in
their
customs
and
feeling
differ
greatly
from
the
chinese
the
government
acted
toward
these
others
with
great
mistrust
and
great
severity
as
morga
testifies
in
the
last
pages
of
his
work
until
they
finally
ceased
to
come
to
the
country
in
fact
it
seems
that
once
an
uprising
planned
by
the
borneans
was
suspected
we
say
suspected
for
there
was
not
even
an
attempt
although
there
were
many
executions
and
as
these
nations
were
the
very
ones
that
consumed
philippine
products
when
all
communication
with
them
had
been
cut
off
consumption
of
these
products
also
ceased
the
only
two
countries
with
which
the
philippines
continued
to
have
relations
were
china
and
mexico
or
new
spain
and
from
this
trade
only
china
and
a
few
private
individuals
in
manila
got
any
benefit
it
fact
the
celestial
empire
sent
her
junks
laden
with
merchandise
that
merchandise
which
shut
down
the
factories
of
seville
and
ruined
the
spanish
industry
and
returned
laden
in
exchange
with
the
silver
that
was
every
year
sent
from
mexico
nothing
from
the
philippines
at
that
time
went
to
china
not
even
gold
for
in
those
years
the
chinese
traders
would
accept
no
payment
but
silver
coin
to
mexico
went
little
more
some
cloth
and
dry
goods
which
the
encomendoros
took
by
force
or
bought
from
the
natives
at
a
paltry
price
wax
amber
gold
civet
etc
but
nothing
more
and
not
even
in
great
quantity
as
is
stated
by
admiral
don
jerónimo
de
bańuelos
y
carrillo
when
he
begged
the
king
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
manilas
be
permitted
to
load
as
many
ships
as
they
could
with
native
products
such
as
wax
gold
perfumes
ivory
cotton
cloths
which
they
would
have
to
buy
from
the
natives
of
the
country
thus
the
friendship
of
those
peoples
would
be
gained
they
would
furnish
new
spain
with
their
merchandise
and
the
money
that
is
brought
to
manila
would
not
leave
this
place
the
coastwise
trade
so
active
in
other
times
had
to
die
out
thanks
to
the
piratical
attacks
of
the
malays
of
the
south
and
trade
in
the
interior
of
the
islands
almost
entirely
disappeared
owing
to
restrictions
passports
and
other
administrative
requirements
of
no
little
importance
were
the
hindrances
and
obstacles
that
from
the
beginning
were
thrown
in
the
farmers
way
by
the
rulers
who
were
influenced
by
childish
fear
and
saw
everywhere
signs
of
conspiracies
and
uprisings
the
natives
were
not
allowed
to
go
to
their
labors
that
is
their
farms
without
permission
of
the
governor
or
of
his
agents
and
officers
and
even
of
the
priests
as
morga
says
those
who
know
the
administrative
slackness
and
confusion
in
a
country
where
the
officials
work
scarcely
two
hours
a
day
those
who
know
the
cost
of
going
to
and
returning
from
the
capital
to
obtain
a
permit
those
who
are
aware
of
the
petty
retaliations
of
the
little
tyrants
will
well
understand
how
with
this
crude
arrangement
it
is
possible
to
have
the
most
absurd
agriculture
true
it
is
that
for
some
time
this
absurdity
which
would
be
ludicrous
had
it
not
been
so
serious
has
disappeared
but
even
if
the
words
have
gone
out
of
use
other
facts
and
other
provisions
have
replaced
them
the
moro
pirate
has
disappeared
but
there
remains
the
outlaw
who
infests
the
fields
and
waylays
the
farmer
to
hold
him
for
ransom
now
then
the
government
which
has
a
constant
fear
of
the
people
denies
to
the
farmers
even
the
use
of
a
shotgun
or
if
it
does
allow
it
does
so
very
grudgingly
and
withdraws
it
at
pleasure
whence
it
results
with
the
laborer
who
thanks
to
his
means
of
defense
plants
his
crops
and
invests
his
meager
fortune
in
the
furrows
that
he
has
so
laboriously
opened
that
when
his
crop
matures
it
occurs
to
the
government
which
is
impotent
to
suppress
brigandage
to
deprive
him
of
his
weapon
and
then
without
defense
and
without
security
he
is
reduced
to
inaction
and
abandons
his
field
his
work
and
takes
to
gambling
as
the
best
means
of
securing
a
livelihood
the
green
cloth
is
under
the
protection
of
the
government
it
is
safer
a
mournful
counselor
is
fear
for
it
not
only
causes
weakness
but
also
in
casting
aside
the
weapons
strengthens
the
very
persecutor
the
sordid
return
the
native
gets
from
his
work
has
the
effect
of
discouraging
him
we
know
from
history
that
the
encomenderos
after
reducing
many
to
slavery
and
forcing
them
to
work
for
their
benefit
made
others
give
up
their
merchandise
for
a
trifle
or
nothing
at
all
or
cheated
them
with
false
measures
speaking
of
ipion
in
panay
padre
gaspar
de
san
agustin
says
it
was
in
ancient
times
very
rich
in
gold
but
provoked
by
the
annoyances
they
suffered
from
some
governors
they
have
ceased
to
get
it
out
preferring
to
live
in
poverty
than
to
suffer
such
hardships
page
further
on
speaking
of
other
towns
he
says
goaded
by
the
ill
treatment
of
the
encomenderos
who
in
administering
justice
have
treated
the
natives
as
their
slaves
and
not
as
their
children
and
have
only
looked
after
their
own
interests
at
the
expense
of
the
wretched
fortunes
and
lives
of
their
charges
page
further
on
in
leyte
where
they
tried
to
kill
an
encomendero
of
the
town
of
dagami
on
account
of
the
great
hardships
he
made
them
suffer
by
exacting
tribute
of
wax
from
them
with
a
steelyard
which
he
had
made
twice
as
long
as
the
others
this
state
of
affairs
lasted
a
long
time
and
still
lasts
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
breed
of
encomenderos
has
become
extinct
a
term
passes
away
but
the
evil
and
the
passions
engendered
do
not
pass
away
so
long
as
reforms
are
devoted
solely
to
changing
the
names
the
wars
with
the
dutch
the
inroads
and
piratical
attacks
of
the
people
of
sulu
and
mindanao
disappeared
the
people
have
been
transformed
new
towns
have
grown
up
while
others
have
become
impoverished
but
the
frauds
subsist
as
much
as
or
worse
than
they
did
in
those
early
years
we
will
not
cite
our
own
experiences
for
aside
from
the
fact
that
we
do
not
know
which
to
select
critical
persons
may
reproach
us
with
partiality
neither
will
we
cite
those
of
other
filipinos
who
write
in
the
newspapers
but
we
shall
confine
ourselves
to
translating
the
words
of
a
modern
french
traveler
who
was
in
the
philippines
for
a
long
time
the
good
curate
he
says
with
reference
to
the
rosy
picture
a
friar
had
given
him
of
the
philippines
had
not
told
me
about
the
governor
the
foremost
official
of
the
district
who
was
too
much
taken
up
with
the
ideal
of
getting
rich
to
have
time
to
tyrannize
over
his
docile
subjects
the
governor
charged
with
ruling
the
country
and
collecting
the
various
taxes
in
the
government
name
devoted
himself
almost
wholly
to
trade
in
his
hands
the
high
and
noble
functions
he
performs
are
nothing
more
than
instruments
of
gain
he
monopolizes
all
the
business
and
instead
of
developing
on
his
part
the
love
of
work
instead
of
stimulating
the
too
natural
indolence
of
the
natives
he
with
abuse
of
his
powers
thinks
only
of
destroying
all
competition
that
may
trouble
him
or
attempt
to
participate
in
his
profits
it
matters
little
to
him
that
the
country
is
impoverished
without
cultivation
without
commerce
without
industry
just
so
the
governor
is
quickly
enriched
yet
the
traveler
has
been
unfair
in
picking
out
the
governor
especially
why
only
the
governor
we
do
not
cite
passages
from
other
authors
because
we
have
not
their
works
at
hand
and
do
not
wish
to
quote
from
memory
the
great
difficulty
that
every
enterprise
encountered
with
the
administration
contributed
not
a
little
to
kill
off
all
commercial
and
industrial
movement
all
the
filipinos
as
well
as
all
those
who
have
tried
to
engage
in
business
in
the
philippines
know
how
many
documents
what
comings
how
many
stamped
papers
how
much
patience
is
needed
to
secure
from
the
government
a
permit
for
an
enterprise
one
must
count
upon
the
good
will
of
this
one
on
the
influence
of
that
one
on
a
good
bribe
to
another
in
order
that
the
application
be
not
pigeonholed
a
present
to
the
one
further
on
so
that
he
may
pass
it
on
to
his
chief
one
must
pray
to
god
to
give
him
good
humor
and
time
to
see
and
examine
it
to
another
talent
to
recognize
its
expediency
to
one
further
on
sufficient
stupidity
not
to
scent
behind
the
enterprise
an
insurrectionary
purpose
and
that
they
may
not
all
spend
the
time
taking
baths
hunting
or
playing
cards
with
the
reverend
friars
in
their
convents
or
country
houses
and
above
all
great
patience
great
knowledge
of
how
to
get
along
plenty
of
money
a
great
deal
of
politics
many
salutations
great
influence
plenty
of
presents
and
complete
resignation
how
is
it
strange
that
the
philippines
remain
poor
in
spite
of
their
very
fertile
soil
when
history
tells
us
that
the
countries
now
the
most
flourishing
date
their
development
from
the
day
of
their
liberty
and
civil
rights
the
most
commercial
and
most
industrious
countries
have
been
the
freest
countries
france
england
and
the
united
states
prove
this
hongkong
which
is
not
worth
the
most
insignificant
of
the
philippines
has
more
commercial
movement
than
all
the
islands
together
because
it
is
free
and
is
well
governed
the
trade
with
china
which
was
the
whole
occupation
of
the
colonizers
of
the
philippines
was
not
only
prejudicial
to
spain
but
also
to
the
life
of
her
colonies
in
fact
when
the
officials
and
private
persons
at
manila
found
an
easy
method
of
getting
rich
they
neglected
everything
they
paid
no
attention
either
to
cultivating
the
soil
or
to
fostering
industry
and
wherefore
china
furnished
the
trade
and
they
had
only
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
pick
up
the
gold
that
dropped
out
on
its
way
from
mexico
toward
the
interior
of
china
the
gulf
whence
it
never
returned
the
pernicious
example
of
the
dominators
in
surrounding
themselves
with
servants
and
despising
manual
or
corporal
labor
as
a
thing
unbecoming
the
nobility
and
chivalrous
pride
of
the
heroes
of
so
many
centuries
those
lordly
airs
which
the
natives
have
translated
into
tila
ka
castila
and
the
desire
of
the
dominated
to
be
the
equal
of
the
dominators
if
not
essentially
at
least
in
their
manners
all
this
had
naturally
to
produce
aversion
to
activity
and
fear
or
hatred
of
work
moreover
work
asked
many
natives
the
curate
says
that
the
rich
man
will
not
go
to
heaven
the
rich
man
on
earth
is
liable
to
all
kinds
of
trouble
to
be
appointed
a
cabeza
de
barangay
to
be
deported
if
an
uprising
occurs
to
be
forced
banker
of
the
military
chief
of
the
town
who
to
reward
him
for
favors
received
seizes
his
laborers
and
his
stock
in
order
to
force
him
to
beg
for
mercy
and
thus
easily
pays
up
why
be
rich
so
that
all
the
officers
of
justice
may
have
a
lynx
eye
on
your
actions
so
that
at
the
least
slip
enemies
may
be
raised
up
against
you
you
may
be
indicted
a
whole
complicated
and
labyrinthine
story
may
be
concocted
against
you
for
which
you
can
only
get
away
not
by
the
thread
of
ariadne
but
by
danae
shower
of
gold
and
still
give
thanks
that
you
are
not
kept
in
reserve
for
some
needy
occasion
the
native
whom
they
pretend
to
regard
as
an
imbecile
is
not
so
much
so
that
he
does
not
understand
that
it
is
ridiculous
to
work
himself
to
death
to
become
worse
off
a
proverb
of
his
says
that
the
pig
is
cooked
in
its
own
lard
and
as
among
his
bad
qualities
he
has
the
good
one
of
applying
to
himself
all
the
criticisms
and
censures
he
prefers
to
live
miserable
and
indolent
rather
than
play
the
part
of
the
wretched
beast
of
burden
add
to
this
the
introduction
of
gambling
we
do
not
mean
to
san
that
before
the
coming
of
the
spaniards
the
natives
did
not
gamble
the
passion
for
grumbling
is
innate
in
adventuresome
and
excitable
races
and
such
is
the
malay
pigafetta
tells
us
of
and
of
bets
in
the
island
of
paragua
must
also
have
existed
in
luzon
and
in
all
the
islands
for
in
the
terminology
of
the
game
are
two
tagalog
words
sabong
and
tari
cockpit
and
gaff
but
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
that
the
fostering
of
this
game
is
due
to
the
government
as
well
as
the
perfecting
of
it
although
pigafetta
tells
us
of
it
he
mentions
it
only
in
paragua
and
not
in
cebu
nor
in
any
other
island
of
the
south
where
he
stayed
long
time
morga
does
not
speak
of
it
in
spite
of
his
having
spent
seven
years
in
manila
and
yet
he
does
describe
the
kinds
of
fowl
the
jungle
hens
and
cocks
neither
does
morga
speak
of
gambling
when
he
talks
about
vices
and
other
defects
more
or
less
concealed
more
or
less
insignificant
moreover
excepting
the
two
tagalog
words
sabong
and
tari
the
others
are
of
spanish
origin
as
soltada
setting
the
cocks
to
fight
then
the
fight
itself
presto
apuesta
bet
logro
winnings
pago
payment
sentenciador
referee
case
to
cover
the
bets
etc
we
say
the
same
about
gambling
the
word
sugal
jugar
to
gamble
like
kumpisal
confesar
to
confess
to
a
priest
indicates
that
gambling
was
unknown
in
the
philippines
before
the
spaniards
the
word
laró
tagalog
to
play
is
not
the
equivalent
of
the
word
sunni
the
word
balasa
baraja
proves
that
the
introduction
of
was
not
due
to
the
chinese
who
have
a
kind
of
also
because
in
that
case
they
would
have
taken
the
chinese
name
is
not
this
enough
the
word
tayá
taltar
to
bet
spanish
pares
pairs
of
cards
politana
napolitana
a
winning
sequence
of
cards
sapore
to
stack
the
cards
kapote
to
slam
monte
and
so
on
all
prove
the
foreign
origin
of
this
terrible
plant
which
only
produces
vice
and
which
has
found
in
the
character
of
the
native
a
fit
soil
cultivated
by
circumstances
along
with
gambling
which
breeds
dislike
for
steady
and
difficult
toil
by
its
promise
of
sudden
wealth
and
its
appeal
to
the
emotions
with
the
lotteries
with
the
prodigality
and
hospitality
of
the
filipinos
went
also
to
swell
this
train
of
misfortunes
the
religious
functions
the
great
number
of
fiestas
the
long
masses
for
the
women
to
spend
their
mornings
and
the
novenaries
to
spend
their
afternoons
and
the
night
for
the
processions
and
rosaries
remember
that
lack
of
capital
and
absence
of
means
paralyze
all
movement
and
you
will
see
how
the
native
has
perforce
to
be
indolent
for
if
any
money
might
remain
to
him
from
the
trials
imposts
and
exactions
he
would
have
to
give
it
to
the
curate
for
bulls
scapularies
candles
novenaries
etc
and
if
this
does
not
suffice
to
form
an
indolent
character
if
the
climate
and
nature
are
not
enough
in
themselves
to
daze
him
and
deprive
him
of
all
energy
recall
then
that
the
doctrines
of
his
religion
teach
him
to
irrigate
his
fields
in
the
dry
season
not
by
means
of
canals
but
with
masses
and
prayers
to
preserve
his
stock
during
an
epizootic
with
holy
water
exorcisms
and
benedictions
that
cost
five
dollars
an
animal
to
drive
away
the
locusts
by
a
procession
with
the
image
of
augustine
etc
it
is
well
undoubtedly
to
trust
greatly
in
god
but
it
is
better
to
do
what
one
can
and
not
trouble
the
creator
every
moment
even
when
these
appeals
redound
to
the
benefit
of
his
ministers
we
have
noticed
that
the
countries
which
believe
most
in
miracles
are
the
laziest
just
as
spoiled
children
are
the
most
whether
they
believe
in
miracles
to
palliate
their
laziness
or
they
are
lazy
because
they
believe
in
miracles
we
can
not
say
but
the
fact
is
the
filipinos
were
much
less
lazy
before
the
word
miracle
was
introduced
into
their
language
the
facility
with
which
individual
liberty
is
curtailed
that
continual
alarm
of
all
from
the
knowledge
that
they
are
liable
to
secret
report
a
governmental
ukase
and
to
the
accusation
of
rebel
or
suspect
an
accusation
which
to
be
effective
does
not
need
proof
or
the
production
of
the
accuser
with
that
lack
of
confidence
in
the
future
that
uncertainty
of
reaping
the
reward
of
labor
as
in
a
city
stricken
with
the
plague
everybody
yields
to
fate
shuts
himself
in
his
house
or
goes
about
amusing
himself
in
the
attempt
to
spend
the
few
days
that
remain
to
him
in
the
least
disagreeable
way
possible
the
apathy
of
the
government
itself
toward
everything
in
commerce
and
agriculture
contributes
not
a
little
to
foster
indolence
there
is
no
encouragement
at
all
for
the
manufacturer
or
for
the
farmer
the
government
furnishes
no
aid
either
when
poor
crop
comes
when
the
locusts
sweep
over
the
fields
or
when
a
cyclone
destroys
in
its
passage
the
wealth
of
the
soil
nor
does
it
take
any
trouble
to
seek
a
market
for
the
products
of
its
colonies
why
should
it
do
so
when
these
same
products
are
burdened
with
taxes
and
imposts
and
have
not
free
entry
into
the
ports
of
the
mother
country
nor
is
their
consumption
there
encouraged
while
we
see
all
the
walls
of
london
covered
with
advertisements
of
the
products
of
its
colonies
while
the
english
make
heroic
efforts
to
substitute
ceylon
for
chinese
tea
beginning
with
the
sacrifice
of
their
taste
and
their
stomach
in
spain
with
the
exception
of
tobacco
nothing
from
the
philippines
is
known
neither
its
sugar
coffee
hemp
fine
cloths
nor
its
ilocano
blankets
the
name
of
manila
is
known
only
from
those
cloths
of
china
or
which
at
one
time
reached
spain
by
way
of
manila
heavy
silk
shawls
fantastically
but
coarsely
embroidered
which
no
one
has
thought
of
imitating
in
manila
since
they
are
so
easily
made
but
the
government
has
other
cares
and
the
filipinos
do
not
know
that
such
objects
are
more
highly
esteemed
in
the
peninsula
than
their
delicate
pińa
embroideries
and
their
very
fine
jusi
fabrics
thus
disappeared
our
trade
in
indigo
thanks
to
the
trickery
of
the
chinese
which
the
government
could
not
guard
against
occupied
as
it
was
with
other
thoughts
thus
die
now
the
other
industries
the
fine
manufactures
of
the
visayas
are
gradually
disappearing
from
trade
and
even
from
use
the
people
continually
getting
poorer
can
not
afford
the
costly
cloths
and
have
to
be
content
with
calico
or
the
imitations
of
the
germans
who
produce
imitations
even
of
the
work
of
our
silversmiths
the
fact
that
the
best
plantations
the
best
tracts
of
land
in
some
provinces
those
that
from
their
easy
access
are
more
profitable
than
others
are
in
the
hands
of
the
religious
corporations
whose
desideratum
is
ignorance
and
a
condition
of
for
the
native
so
that
they
may
continue
to
govern
him
and
make
themselves
necessary
to
his
wretched
existence
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
many
towns
do
not
progress
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
their
inhabitants
we
will
be
met
with
the
objections
as
an
argument
on
the
other
side
that
the
towns
which
belong
to
the
friars
are
comparatively
richer
than
those
which
do
not
belong
to
them
they
surely
are
just
as
their
brethren
in
europe
in
founding
their
convents
knew
how
to
select
the
best
valleys
the
best
uplands
for
the
cultivation
of
the
vine
or
the
production
of
beer
so
also
the
philippine
monks
have
known
how
to
select
the
best
towns
the
beautiful
plains
the
fields
to
make
of
them
rich
plantations
for
some
time
the
friars
have
deceived
many
by
making
them
believe
that
if
these
plantations
were
prospering
it
was
because
they
were
under
their
care
and
the
indolence
of
the
native
was
thus
emphasized
but
they
forget
that
in
same
provinces
where
they
have
not
been
able
for
some
reason
to
get
possession
of
the
best
tracts
of
land
their
plantations
like
baurand
and
liang
are
inferior
to
taal
balayan
and
lipa
regions
cultivated
entirely
by
the
natives
without
any
monkish
interference
whatsoever
add
to
this
lack
of
material
inducement
the
absentee
of
moral
stimulus
and
you
will
see
how
he
who
is
not
indolent
in
that
country
must
needs
be
a
madman
or
at
least
a
fool
what
future
awaits
him
who
distinguishes
himself
him
who
studies
who
rises
above
the
crowd
at
the
cost
of
study
and
sacrifice
a
young
man
becomes
a
great
chemist
and
after
a
long
course
of
training
wherein
neither
the
government
nor
anybody
has
given
him
the
least
help
he
concludes
his
long
stay
in
the
university
a
competitive
examination
is
held
to
fill
a
certain
position
the
young
man
wins
this
through
knowledge
and
perseverance
and
after
he
has
won
it
it
is
abolished
because
we
do
not
care
to
give
the
reason
but
when
a
municipal
laboratory
is
closed
in
order
to
abolish
the
position
of
director
who
got
his
place
by
competitive
examination
while
other
officers
such
as
the
press
censor
are
preserved
it
is
because
the
belief
exists
that
the
light
of
progress
may
injure
the
people
more
than
all
the
adulterated
foods
in
the
same
way
another
young
man
won
a
prize
in
a
literary
competition
and
as
long
as
his
origin
was
unknown
his
work
was
discussed
the
newspapers
praised
it
and
it
was
regarded
as
a
masterpiece
but
the
sealed
envelopes
were
opened
the
winner
proved
to
be
a
native
while
among
the
losers
there
were
peninsulars
then
all
the
newspapers
hastened
to
extol
the
losers
not
one
word
from
the
government
nor
from
anybody
to
encourage
the
native
who
with
so
much
affection
was
cultivating
the
language
and
letters
of
the
mother
country
finally
passing
over
many
other
more
or
less
insignificant
reasons
the
enumeration
of
which
would
be
interminable
let
us
close
this
dreary
list
with
the
principal
and
most
terrible
of
all
the
education
of
the
native
from
his
birth
until
he
sinks
into
his
grave
the
training
of
the
native
is
brutalizing
depressive
and
antihuman
the
word
is
not
sufficiently
explanatory
whether
or
not
the
academy
admit
it
let
it
go
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
government
some
priests
like
the
jesuits
and
some
dominicans
like
padre
benavides
have
done
a
great
deal
by
founding
colleges
schools
of
primary
instruction
and
the
like
but
this
is
not
enough
their
effect
is
neutralized
they
amount
to
five
or
ten
years
years
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
days
at
most
during
which
the
youth
comes
in
contact
with
books
selected
by
those
very
priests
who
boldly
proclaim
that
it
is
an
evil
for
the
natives
to
know
castilian
that
the
native
should
not
be
separated
from
his
carabao
that
he
should
not
have
any
further
aspirations
and
so
on
five
to
ten
years
during
which
the
majority
of
the
students
have
grasped
nothing
more
than
that
no
one
understands
what
the
books
say
not
even
the
professors
themselves
perhaps
and
these
five
to
ten
years
have
to
offset
the
daily
preachment
of
the
whole
life
that
preachment
which
lowers
the
dignity
of
man
which
by
degrees
brutally
deprives
him
of
the
sentiment
of
that
eternal
stubborn
constant
labor
to
bow
the
native
neck
to
make
him
accept
the
yoke
to
place
him
on
a
level
with
the
beast
a
labor
aided
by
some
persons
with
or
without
the
ability
to
write
which
if
it
does
not
produce
in
some
individuals
the
desired
effect
in
others
it
has
the
opposite
effect
like
the
breaking
of
a
cord
that
is
stretched
too
tightly
thus
while
they
attempt
to
make
of
the
native
a
kind
of
animal
vet
in
exchange
they
demand
of
him
divine
actions
and
we
say
divine
actions
because
he
must
be
a
god
who
does
not
become
indolent
in
that
climate
surrounded
by
the
circumstances
mentioned
deprive
a
man
then
of
his
dignity
and
you
not
only
deprive
him
of
his
moral
strength
but
you
also
make
him
useless
even
for
those
who
wish
to
make
use
of
him
every
creature
has
its
stimulus
its
mainspring
man
is
his
take
it
away
from
him
and
he
is
a
corpse
and
he
who
seeks
activity
in
a
corpse
will
encounter
only
worms
thus
is
explained
how
the
natives
of
the
present
time
are
no
longer
the
same
as
those
of
the
time
of
the
discovery
neither
morally
nor
physically
the
ancient
writers
like
chirino
morga
and
colin
take
pleasure
in
describing
them
as
with
good
aptitudes
for
any
thing
they
take
up
keen
and
susceptible
and
of
resolute
will
very
clean
and
neat
in
their
persons
and
clothing
and
of
good
mien
and
bearing
morga
others
delight
in
minute
accounts
of
their
intelligence
and
pleasant
manners
of
their
aptitude
for
music
the
drama
dancing
and
singing
of
the
facility
with
which
they
learned
not
only
spanish
but
also
latin
which
they
acquired
almost
by
themselves
colin
others
of
their
exquisite
politeness
in
their
dealings
and
in
their
social
life
others
like
the
first
augustinians
whose
accounts
gaspar
de
san
augustin
copies
found
them
more
gallant
and
better
mannered
than
the
inhabitants
of
the
moluccas
all
live
off
their
husbandry
adds
morga
their
farms
fisheries
and
enterprises
for
they
travel
from
island
to
island
by
sea
and
from
province
to
province
by
land
in
exchange
the
writers
of
the
present
time
without
being
better
than
those
of
former
times
neither
as
men
nor
as
historians
without
being
more
gallant
than
hernan
cortez
and
salcedo
nor
more
prudent
than
legazpi
nor
more
manly
than
morga
nor
more
studious
than
colin
and
gaspar
de
san
agustin
our
contemporary
writers
we
say
find
that
the
native
is
a
creature
something
more
than
a
monkey
but
much
less
than
a
man
an
anthropoid
stupid
timid
dirty
cringing
grinning
indolent
lazy
brainless
immoral
etc
to
what
is
this
retrogression
due
is
it
the
delectable
civilization
the
religion
of
salvation
of
the
friars
called
of
jesus
christ
by
a
euphemism
that
has
produced
this
miracle
that
has
atrophied
his
brain
paralyzed
his
heart
and
made
of
the
man
this
sort
of
vicious
animal
that
the
writers
depict
alas
the
whole
misfortune
of
the
present
filipinos
consists
in
that
they
have
become
only
brutes
the
filipino
is
convinced
that
to
get
happiness
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
lay
aside
his
dignity
as
a
rational
creature
to
attend
mass
to
believe
what
is
told
him
to
pay
what
is
demanded
of
him
to
pay
and
forever
to
pay
to
work
suffer
and
be
silent
without
aspiring
to
anything
without
aspiring
to
know
or
even
to
understand
spanish
without
separating
himself
from
his
carabao
as
the
priests
shamelessly
say
without
protesting
against
any
injustice
against
any
arbitrary
action
against
an
assault
against
an
insult
that
is
not
to
have
heart
brain
or
spirit
a
creature
with
arms
and
a
purse
full
of
gold
the
ideal
native
unfortunately
or
because
the
brutalization
is
not
yet
complete
and
because
the
nature
of
man
is
inherent
in
his
being
in
spite
of
his
condition
the
native
protests
he
still
has
aspirations
he
thinks
and
strives
to
rise
and
there
the
trouble
v
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
set
forth
the
causes
that
proceed
from
the
government
in
fostering
and
maintaining
the
evil
we
are
discussing
now
it
falls
to
us
to
analyze
those
that
emanate
from
the
people
peoples
and
governments
are
correlated
and
complementary
a
fatuous
government
would
be
an
anomaly
among
righteous
people
just
as
a
corrupt
people
can
not
exist
under
just
rulers
and
wise
laws
like
people
like
government
we
will
say
in
paraphrase
of
a
popular
adage
we
can
reduce
all
these
causes
to
two
classes
to
defects
of
training
and
lack
of
national
sentiment
of
the
influence
of
climate
we
spoke
at
the
beginning
so
we
will
not
treat
of
the
effects
arising
from
it
the
very
limited
training
in
the
home
the
tyrannical
and
sterile
education
of
the
rare
centers
of
learning
that
blind
subordination
of
the
youth
to
one
of
greater
age
influence
the
mind
so
that
a
man
may
not
aspire
to
excel
those
who
preceded
him
but
must
merely
be
content
to
go
along
with
or
march
behind
them
stagnation
forcibly
results
from
this
and
as
he
who
devotes
himself
merely
to
copying
divests
himself
of
other
qualities
suited
to
his
own
nature
he
naturally
becomes
sterile
hence
decadence
indolence
is
a
corollary
derived
from
the
lack
of
stimulus
and
of
vitality
that
modesty
infused
into
the
convictions
of
every
one
or
to
speak
more
clearly
that
insinuated
inferiority
a
sort
of
daily
and
constant
depreciation
of
the
mind
so
that
it
may
not
be
raised
to
the
regions
of
light
deadens
the
energies
paralyzes
all
tendency
toward
advancement
and
at
the
least
struggle
a
man
gives
up
without
fighting
if
by
one
of
those
rare
accidents
some
wild
spirit
that
is
some
active
one
excels
instead
of
his
example
stimulating
it
only
causes
others
to
persist
in
their
inaction
one
who
will
work
for
us
let
sleep
on
say
his
relatives
and
friends
true
it
is
that
the
spirit
of
rivalry
is
sometimes
awakened
only
that
then
it
awakens
with
bad
humor
in
the
guise
of
envy
and
instead
of
being
a
lever
for
helping
it
is
an
obstacle
that
produces
discouragement
nurtured
by
the
example
of
anchorites
of
a
contemplative
and
lazy
life
the
natives
spend
theirs
in
giving
their
gold
to
the
church
in
the
hope
of
miracles
and
other
wonderful
things
their
will
is
hypnotized
from
childhood
they
learn
to
act
mechanically
without
knowledge
of
the
object
thanks
to
the
exercises
imposed
upon
them
from
the
tenderest
years
of
praying
for
whole
hours
in
an
unknown
tongue
of
venerating
things
that
they
do
not
understand
of
accepting
beliefs
that
are
not
explained
to
them
to
having
absurdities
imposed
upon
them
while
the
protests
of
reason
are
repressed
is
it
any
wonder
that
with
this
vicious
dressage
of
intelligence
and
will
the
native
of
old
logical
and
consistent
as
the
analysis
of
his
past
and
of
his
language
demonstrates
should
now
be
a
mass
of
dismal
contradictions
that
continual
struggle
between
reason
and
duty
between
his
organism
and
his
new
ideals
that
civil
war
which
disturbs
the
peace
of
his
conscience
all
his
life
has
the
result
of
paralyzing
all
his
energies
and
aided
by
the
severity
of
the
climate
makes
of
that
eternal
vacillation
of
the
doubts
in
his
brain
the
origin
of
his
indolent
disposition
you
ca
know
more
than
this
or
that
old
man
do
aspire
to
be
greater
than
the
curate
you
belong
to
an
inferior
race
you
have
any
energy
this
is
what
they
tell
the
child
and
as
they
repeat
it
so
often
it
has
perforce
to
become
engraved
on
his
mind
and
thence
mould
and
pervade
all
his
actions
the
child
or
youth
who
tries
to
be
anything
else
is
blamed
with
vanity
and
presumption
the
curate
ridicules
him
with
cruel
sarcasm
his
relatives
look
upon
him
with
fear
strangers
regard
him
with
great
compassion
no
forward
movement
get
back
in
the
ranks
and
keep
in
line
with
his
spirit
thus
moulded
the
native
falls
into
the
most
pernicious
of
all
routines
routine
not
planned
but
imposed
and
forced
note
that
the
native
himself
is
not
naturally
inclined
to
routine
but
his
mind
is
disposed
to
accept
all
truths
just
as
his
house
is
open
to
all
strangers
the
good
and
the
beautiful
attract
him
seduce
and
captivate
him
although
like
the
japanese
he
often
exchanges
the
good
for
the
evil
if
it
appears
to
him
garnished
and
gilded
what
he
lacks
is
in
the
first
place
liberty
to
allow
expansion
to
his
adventuresome
spirit
and
good
examples
beautiful
prospects
for
the
future
it
is
necessary
that
his
spirit
although
it
may
be
dismayed
and
cowed
by
the
elements
and
the
fearful
manifestation
of
their
mighty
forces
store
up
energy
seek
high
purposes
in
order
to
struggle
against
obstacles
in
the
midst
of
unfavorable
natural
conditions
in
order
that
he
may
progress
it
is
necessary
that
a
revolutionary
spirit
so
to
speak
should
boil
in
his
veins
since
progress
necessarily
requires
change
it
implies
the
overthrow
of
the
past
there
deified
by
the
present
the
victory
of
new
ideas
over
the
ancient
and
accepted
ones
it
will
not
be
sufficient
to
speak
to
his
fancy
to
talk
nicely
to
him
nor
that
the
light
illuminate
him
like
the
ignis
fatuus
that
leads
travelers
astray
at
night
all
the
flattering
promises
of
the
fairest
hopes
will
not
suffice
so
long
as
his
spirit
is
not
free
his
intelligence
not
respected
the
reasons
that
originate
in
the
lack
of
national
sentiment
are
still
more
lamentable
and
more
transcendental
convinced
by
the
insinuation
of
his
inferiority
his
spirit
harassed
by
his
education
if
that
brutalization
of
which
we
spoke
above
can
be
called
education
in
that
exchange
of
usages
and
sentiments
among
different
nations
the
filipino
to
whom
remain
only
his
susceptibility
and
his
poetical
imagination
allows
himself
to
be
guided
by
his
fancy
and
his
it
is
sufficient
that
the
foreigner
praise
to
him
the
imported
merchandise
and
run
down
the
native
product
for
him
to
hasten
to
make
the
change
without
reflecting
that
everything
has
its
weak
side
and
the
most
sensible
custom
is
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
do
not
follow
it
they
have
dazzled
him
with
tinsel
with
strings
of
colored
glass
beads
with
noisy
rattles
shining
mirrors
and
other
trinkets
and
he
has
given
in
return
his
gold
his
conscience
and
even
his
liberty
he
changed
his
religion
for
the
external
practices
of
another
cult
the
convictions
and
usages
derived
from
his
climate
and
needs
for
other
usages
and
other
convictions
that
developed
under
another
sky
and
another
inspiration
his
spirit
toward
everything
that
looks
good
to
him
was
then
transformed
at
the
pleasure
of
the
nation
that
forced
upon
him
its
god
and
its
laws
and
as
the
trader
with
whom
he
dealt
did
not
bring
a
cargo
of
useful
implements
of
iron
hoes
to
till
the
fields
but
stamped
papers
crucifixes
bulls
and
as
he
did
not
have
for
ideal
and
prototype
the
tanned
and
vigorous
laborer
but
the
aristocratic
lord
carried
in
a
luxurious
litter
the
result
was
that
the
imitative
people
became
bookish
devout
prayerful
it
acquired
ideas
of
luxury
and
ostentation
without
thereby
improving
the
means
of
its
subsistence
to
a
corresponding
degree
the
lack
of
national
sentiment
brings
another
evil
moreover
which
is
the
absence
of
all
opposition
to
measures
prejudicial
to
the
people
and
the
absence
of
any
initiative
in
whatever
may
redound
to
its
good
a
man
in
the
philippines
is
only
an
individual
he
is
not
a
member
of
a
nation
he
is
forbidden
and
denied
the
right
of
association
and
is
therefore
weak
and
sluggish
the
philippines
are
an
organism
whose
cells
seem
to
have
no
arterial
system
to
irrigate
it
or
nervous
system
to
communicate
its
impressions
these
cells
must
nevertheless
yield
their
product
get
it
where
they
can
if
they
perish
let
them
perish
in
the
view
of
some
this
is
expedient
so
that
a
colony
may
be
a
colony
perhaps
they
are
right
but
not
to
the
effect
that
a
colony
may
flourish
the
result
of
this
is
that
if
a
prejudicial
measure
is
ordered
no
one
protests
all
goes
well
apparently
until
later
the
evils
are
felt
another
and
as
the
organism
has
neither
nerves
nor
voice
the
physician
proceeds
in
the
belief
that
the
treatment
is
not
injuring
it
it
needs
a
reform
but
as
it
must
not
speak
it
keeps
silent
and
remains
with
the
need
the
patient
wants
to
eat
it
wants
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
but
as
such
desires
may
offend
the
susceptibility
of
the
physician
who
thinks
that
he
has
already
provided
everything
necessary
it
suffers
and
pines
away
from
fear
of
receiving
scolding
of
getting
another
plaster
and
a
new
and
so
on
indefinitely
in
addition
to
this
love
of
peace
and
the
horror
many
have
of
accepting
the
few
administrative
positions
which
fall
to
the
filipinos
on
account
of
the
trouble
and
annoyance
these
cause
them
places
at
the
head
of
the
people
the
most
stupid
and
incapable
men
those
who
submit
to
everything
those
who
can
endure
all
the
caprices
and
exactions
of
the
curate
and
of
the
officials
with
this
inefficiency
in
the
lower
spheres
of
power
and
ignorance
and
indifference
in
the
upper
with
the
frequent
changes
and
the
eternal
apprenticeships
with
great
fear
and
many
administrative
obstacles
with
a
voiceless
people
that
has
neither
initiative
nor
cohesion
with
employees
who
nearly
all
strive
to
amass
a
fortune
and
return
home
with
inhabit
ants
who
live
in
great
hardship
from
the
instant
they
begin
to
breathe
create
prosperity
agriculture
and
industry
found
enterprises
and
companies
things
that
still
hardly
prosper
in
free
and
communities
yes
all
attempt
is
useless
that
does
not
spring
from
a
profound
study
of
the
evil
that
afflicts
us
to
combat
this
indolence
some
have
proposed
increasing
the
native
needs
and
raising
the
taxes
what
has
happened
criminals
have
multiplied
penury
has
been
aggravated
why
because
the
native
already
has
enough
needs
with
his
functions
of
the
church
with
his
fiestas
with
the
public
offices
forced
on
him
the
donations
and
bribes
that
he
has
to
make
so
that
he
may
drag
out
his
wretched
existence
the
cord
is
already
too
taut
we
have
heard
many
complaints
and
every
day
we
read
in
the
papers
about
the
efforts
the
government
is
making
to
rescue
the
country
from
its
condition
of
indolence
weighing
its
plans
its
illusions
and
its
difficulties
we
are
reminded
of
the
gardener
who
tried
to
raise
a
tree
planted
in
a
small
the
gardener
spent
his
days
tending
and
watering
the
handful
of
earth
he
trimmed
the
plant
frequently
he
pulled
at
it
to
lengthen
it
and
hasten
its
growth
he
grafted
on
it
cedars
and
oaks
until
one
day
the
little
tree
died
leaving
the
man
convinced
that
it
belonged
to
a
degenerate
species
attributing
the
failure
of
his
experiment
to
everything
except
the
lack
of
soil
and
his
own
ineffable
folly
without
education
and
liberty
that
soil
and
that
sun
of
mankind
no
reform
is
possible
no
measure
can
give
the
result
desired
this
does
not
mean
that
we
should
ask
first
for
the
native
the
instruction
of
a
sage
and
all
imaginable
liberties
in
order
then
to
put
a
hoe
in
his

such
a
pretension
would
be
an
absurdity

vain
folly
what
we
wish
is
that
obstacles
be
not
put
in
his
way
that
the
many
his
climate
and
the
situation
of
the
islands
afford
be
not
augmented
that
instruction
be
not
begrudged
him
for
fear
that
when
he
becomes
intelligent
he
may
separate
from
the
colonizing
nation
or
ask
for
the
rights
of
which
he
makes
himself
worthy
since
some
day

other
he
will
become
enlightened
whether
the
government
wishes
it
or
not
let
his
enlightenment
be
as
a
gift
received
and
not
as

we
desire
that
the
policy
be
at
once
frank
and
consistent
that
is
highly
civilizing
without
sordid
reservations
without
distrust
without
fear
or
jealousy
wishing
the
good
for
the
sake
of
the
good
civilization
for
the
sake
of
civilization
without
ulterior
thoughts
of
gratitude
or
else
boldly
exploiting
tyrannical
and
selfish
without
hypocrisy
or
deception
with
a
whole
system
and
studied
out
for
dominating
by
compelling
obedience
for
commanding
to
get
rich
for
getting
rich
to
be
happy
if
the
former
the
government
may
act
with
the
security
that
some
day
or
other
it
will
reap
the
harvest
and
will
find
a
people
its
own
in
heart
and
interest
there
is
nothing
like
a
favor
for
securing
the
friendship
or
enmity
of
man
according
to
whether
it
be
conferred
with
good
will
or
hurled
into
his
face
and
bestowed
upon
him
in
spite
of
himself
if
the
logical
and
regulated
system
of
exploitation
be
chosen
stifling
with
the
jingle
of
gold
and
the
sheen
of
opulence
the
sentiments
of
independence
in
the
colonies
paying
with
its
wealth
for
its
lack
of
liberty
as
the
english
do
in
india
who
moreover
leave
the
government
to
native
rulers
then
build
roads
lay
out
highways
foster
the
freedom
of
trade
let
the
government
heed
material
interests
more
than
the
interests
of
four
orders
of

let
it
send
out
intelligent
employees
to
foster
industry
just
judges
all
well
paid
so
that
they
be
not
venal
pilferers

lay
aside

this
policy
has
the
advantage
in
that

not
lull
the
instincts

liberty
wholly
to
sleep
yet
the

there
is
no
doubt
of
the
frequency
of
trade
among
the
peoples
of
the
philippines
at
an
early
period
trade
was
stimulated
by
the
very
fact
that
the
malay
peoples
except
those
who
have
been
driven
into
the
mountainous
interiors
are
by
their
very
nature
a
seafaring
people
the
fact
of
an
traffic
is
indicative
of
a
culture
above
that
possessed
by
a
people
in
the
barbarian
stage
of
culture
of
course
there
was
considerable
chinese
trade
as
well
throughout
the
islands
this
estimate
is
somewhat
high
a
writer
in
speaking
of
the
population
of
manila
the
metropolis
of
the
philippines
then
as
now
about
says
that
its
population
scarcely
reached
instead
of
the
reported
licentiate
pedro
de
rojas
of
the
manila
audiencia
in
a
letter
to
felipe
ii
june
pp
says
if
there
were
no
trade
with
china
the
citizens
of
these
islands
would
be
richer
for
the
natives
if
they
had
not
so
many
tostons
would
pay
their
tributes
in
the
articles
which
they
produce
and
which
are
current
that
is
cloths
lampotes
cotton
and
all
of
which
have
great
value
in
nueva
espańa
these
they
cease
to
produce
because
of
the
abundance
of
silver
and
what
is
worse
and
entails
more
loss
upon
your
majesty
is
that
they
do
not
as
formerly
work
the
mines
and
take
out
gold
the
old
records
contains
numerous
references
to
the
decline
of

native
industries

the
philippines

what

most
distressing
picture

account

reckoned

persons
one
tribute
being
required
for
each
adult
male
hence
tributaries
and
families
may
here
be
taken
to
mean
about
the
same
number
the
forced
labor
required
by
the
spaniards
in
shipbuilding
formed
one
of
the
legitimate
causes

complaint

people

very
faults
