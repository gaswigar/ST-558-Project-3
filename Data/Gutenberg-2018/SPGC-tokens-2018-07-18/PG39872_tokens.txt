chapter
i
he
was
a
base
and
a
cruel
knight
as
ever
my
two
eyes
did
see
and
all
that
he
did
and
all
that
he
said
it
was
by
the
might
of
glamourye
but
yet
his
gear
was
o
the
goude
as
it
waved
and
wampished
in
the
wind
and
the
steed
he
rode
upon
it
was
fleeter
than
the
bonny
hind
of
sir
colin
the
distance
from
melrose
to
the
castle
of
aikwood
being
only
about
nine
english
miles
our
party
came
in
view
of
it
before
it
was
one
of
those
dead
calm
winter
evenings
not
uncommon
at
that
season
when
the
slightest
noise
is
heard
at
a
distance
and
the
echoes
are
all
abroad
as
they
drew
near
to
the
huge
pile
silence
prevailed
among
them
more
and
more
all
was
so
still
that
even
that
beautiful
valley
seemed
a
waste
there
was
no
hind
whistling
at
the
plough
no
cattle
nor
sheep
grazing
on
the
holms
of
aikwood
no
bustle
of
servants
kinsmen
or
their
grooms
as
at
the
castles
of
other
knights
it
seemed
as
if
the
breath
of
the
enchanter
or
his
eye
had
been
infectious
and
had
withered
all
within
its
influence
whether
of
vegetable
animal
or
human
life
the
castle
itself
scarcely
seemed
to
be
the
abode
of
man
the
massy
gates
were
all
locked
no
porter
was
in
attendance
and
there
was
only
one
small
piping
smoke
issuing
from
one
of
the
turrets
gude
faith
callans
said
charlie
that
a
douth
and
an
awsome
looking
bigging
i
wish
we
were
fairly
in
and
safely
out
again
is
that
now
to
be
my
residence
yardbire
said
the
beautiful
delany
will
you
go
away
and
leave
elias
and
me
in
that
frightsome
and
desolate
looking
mansion
if
the
great
master
gie
us
a
civil
answer
said
charlie
not
well
wotting
what
to
say
and
desire
to
have
you
for
his
handmaiden
or
rather
the
mistress
of
his
castle
to
overlook
the
other
maids
and
the
spinning
and
weaving
concerns
like
then
we
have
orders
to
leave
you
but
if
he
should
be
cross
and
crabbit
and
paughty
wi
us
ye
in
gude
hands
and
we
no
quat
wi
you
sae
easily
thou
art
in
good
hands
indeed
said
the
friar
but
alas
what
is
man
a
flower
of
the
field
that
the
hand
of
the
mower
cutteth
down
and
leaveth
to
decay
a
shadow
a
sound
that
passeth
away
and
is
not
but
maiden
thou
art
in
better
hands
than
ours
in
hands
that
will
not
leave
the
innocent
and
guiltless
to
perish
there
is
an
arm
around
thee
that
thou
seest
not
there
is
a
guardian
with
a
sword
behind
thee
and
before
thee
of
whom
thou
art
not
aware
therefore
have
thou
no
fear
for
no
evil
shall
befal
thee
methinks
i
could
live
any
where
and
be
void
of
fear
if
but
suffered
to
be
in
your
presence
said
delany
there
is
something
in
what
you
have
told
me
that
goes
to
my
heart
and
on
it
i
think
i
can
rely
blessed
be
thou
my
daughter
said
he
yea
and
blessed
shalt
thou
be
in
thy
generation
hear
to
that
said
the
poet
aside
still
on
one
subject
it
is
all
over
with
some
body
but
thou
art
perhaps
going
into
a
place
of
danger
and
evil
things
may
await
thee
here
take
thou
this
and
keep
it
in
thy
bosom
and
by
the
blessing
of
the
holy
virgin
it
shall
shield
thee
from
all
malevolent
spirits
all
enchantments
and
all
dangers
of
the
wicked
one
the
time
may
come
when
thou
shalt
more
thoroughly
understand
the
great
things
contained
in
this
book
as
he
said
this
he
put
into
her
hand
a
small
gilded
copy
of
the
four
evangelists
which
she
kissed
and
put
into
her
bosom
all
the
rest
saw
this
and
took
it
for
a
book
of
the
black
art
by
this
time
they
were
drawing
near
to
the
gate
at
aikwood
where
all
continued
silent
and
still
as
formerly
notwithstanding
of
this
charlie
horse
corby
began
to
cock
his
ears
and
snort
in
a
terrible
manner
as
charlie
war
his
countenance
began
to
alter
but
he
uttered
not
a
word
farther
than
coaxing
corby
to
proceed
the
mule
leading
the
way
altogether
regardless
the
horses
jogged
on
after
him
example
going
farther
than
precept
whether
with
man
or
beast
all
the
horses
were
however
become
restive
though
none
of
them
was
half
so
fierce
as
corby
he
continued
to
force
down
his
head
as
if
smelling
the
ground
anon
capering
and
snuffing
the
air
snorting
aloud
and
moving
with
an
elasticity
rather
like
a
thing
of
spirit
than
of
joints
and
bones
gude
faith
corby
my
man
said
charlie
as
he
patted
his
mane
a
isna
right
here
wend
on
ye
camstairy
thief
what
the
deil
ails
ye
but
gude
sauf
us
ane
should
take
care
wha
they
name
here
they
say
an
speak
o
the
deil
he
appear
the
old
proverb
had
scarcely
left
charlie
lips
when
all
at
once
they
beheld
three
pages
in
black
livery
standing
ranged
before
the
gate
although
the
moment
before
there
was
no
living
creature
there
they
seemed
to
have
arisen
out
of
the
ground
and
as
they
rose
they
bowed
their
heads
in
a
sarcastic
way
to
the
embassy
the
appearance
of
the
pages
and
the
motion
that
they
made
were
both
accomplished
in
the
same
moment
of
time
and
at
the
motion
every
one
of
the
horses
broke
away
like
so
many
scared
wildfowl
some
one
way
and
some
another
charlie
tried
to
restrain
corby
with
the
whole
might
of
his
capacious
arm
but
the
impatient
animal
plunged
and
bounded
into
the
air
with
such
violence
that
his
rider
was
obliged
to
give
him
head
and
away
he
sprung
like
a
roe
over
field
and
river
straining
every
nerve
to
be
out
of
sight
of
aikwood
while
charlie
warrior
cloak
that
hung
only
by
the
shoulder
clasp
flapped
so
far
behind
him
that
he
appeared
like
a
black
cloud
skimming
the
valley
though
none
of
the
other
horses
made
equal
speed
with
corby
every
one
ran
as
fast
as
it
could
and
all
to
the
eastward
though
far
asunder
the
mule
on
the
contrary
never
moved
nor
concerned
himself
about
the
matter
he
indeed
held
forward
his
long
ears
and
took
a
serious
look
of
the
pages
as
of
some
sort
of
beings
he
did
not
more
than
generally
understand
nevertheless
he
despised
them
and
looked
about
with
apparent
astonishment
and
derision
at
the
madness
and
folly
of
his
associates
the
friar
finding
himself
left
with
his
mule
and
the
three
pages
thus
unaccountably
began
to
address
the
latter
but
they
only
imitated
his
motions
and
made
wry
faces
without
returning
him
any
answer
the
mule
had
by
this
time
taken
another
serious
look
at
them
and
disliking
them
exceedingly
he
sidled
towards
them
with
all
his
mettle
and
tried
to
hit
them
with
his
heels
the
urchins
then
raised
such
an
eldritch
laugh
that
they
made
the
arches
of
the
castle
to
ring
and
skipping
about
and
about
provoked
the
mule
to
farther
violence
he
on
his
part
was
nothing
loth
to
attack
he
ran
at
one
kicked
at
another
and
tried
to
crush
another
up
against
the
gate
all
to
the
great
annoyance
of
the
friar
who
with
the
utmost
difficulty
kept
his
seat
for
a
good
while
in
spite
of
the
mad
evolutions
of
his
provoked
and
provoking
beast
but
the
game
once
begun
was
not
suffered
to
subside
the
giggling
elves
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
skipped
about
and
in
whatever
direction
the
mule
darted
one
of
them
was
always
pricking
him
behind
the
worthy
friar
waxed
very
wroth
and
swore
by
the
life
of
pharaoh
that
he
would
execute
vengeance
on
them
but
the
noise
of
mirth
and
mischief
waxed
louder
and
louder
until
the
austere
inmates
of
the
castle
heard
and
the
great
master
said
to
his
only
attendant
gourlay
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
uproar
it
is
only
prig
prim
and
pricker
said
he
making
sport
with
a
mendicant
friar
and
his
ass
are
they
killing
him
enquired
his
master
with
the
greatest
composure
and
without
lifting
his
eyes
from
a
large
book
that
lay
before
him
i
wot
not
sire
said
gourlay
with
the
same
indifference
ay
it
is
no
matter
returned
the
master
it
will
keep
them
in
employment
a
little
while
perhaps
said
gourlay
and
retired
back
to
the
casement
with
sullen
step
by
this
time
the
mule
had
become
so
outrageous
that
he
wheeled
kicked
and
plunged
like
one
of
the
furies
and
at
the
last
in
spite
of
all
the
friar
could
do
laid
him
fairly
on
his
back
amid
the
frantic
shrieks
and
gibberish
of
his
tormentors
gourlay
beheld
the
incident
from
the
crevice
of
the
turret
and
not
daring
to
discompose
the
great
master
he
walked
down
to
the
gate
to
witness
the
sport
at
a
shorter
distance
though
with
a
callous
indifference
about
the
matter
and
without
the
least
hope
to
enjoy
it
when
he
came
nigh
to
the
scene
of
action
he
looked
as
if
he
expected
the
friar
to
have
been
dead
and
was
rather
astonished
when
he
saw
him
raise
his
head
and
utter
a
solemn
anathema
against
the
pages
who
fled
back
as
if
awed
and
overcome
the
seneschal
not
comprehending
this
turned
his
pale
glazed
cheek
toward
the
friar
elevated
his
brow
as
if
looking
at
the
verge
of
the
high
hill
beyond
the
river
and
stood
motionless
stealing
a
side
glance
now
and
then
of
the
stranger
the
latter
raised
up
his
gruff
face
inflamed
with
passion
and
seeing
the
tall
ungainly
figure
of
gourlay
standing
like
a
statue
with
a
red
turban
on
his
head
and
a
grey
frock
or
mantle
that
in
ample
folds
covered
him
from
the
neck
to
the
sandals
took
him
at
once
for
the
mighty
enchanter
and
addressed
him
with
as
little
respect
as
might
be
if
thou
art
the
lord
of
this
mansion
draw
near
unto
me
that
i
may
tell
thee
of
the
deeds
of
thy
servants
which
eat
thy
bread
and
stand
at
thy
gate
lo
have
they
not
lifted
up
the
hand
against
my
life
who
am
a
stranger
and
a
servant
of
him
against
whom
thou
hast
rebelled
and
lifted
up
the
heel
go
to
thou
art
a
churl
and
a
derision
and
a
among
thy
kindred
and
people
and
not
worthy
to
be
called
by
their
name
i
came
unto
thy
gate
in
peace
on
a
message
of
peace
and
the
words
of
peace
were
in
my
mouth
and
why
hast
thou
suffered
these
children
of
the
wicked
one
to
maltreat
and
abuse
me
why
dost
thou
not
open
thy
mouth
the
pages
chattered
with
a
malicious
laugh
at
a
distance
and
the
seneschal
came
stalking
near
in
a
sort
of
confused
astonishment
to
take
a
nearer
view
of
this
talking
phenomenon
he
came
and
looked
over
him
without
altering
a
muscle
of
his
face
and
the
friar
irritated
by
pain
and
the
contempt
shewn
toward
his
sufferings
went
on
at
any
other
time
he
would
haply
have
been
chilled
by
the
pale
frigid
countenance
shagged
beard
and
glazed
unearthly
eye
that
were
now
bent
over
him
but
in
the
present
state
of
his
feelings
he
disregarded
them
and
though
convinced
that
he
spoke
to
the
mighty
enchanter
himself
continued
his
harangue
come
thou
near
unto
me
that
i
may
curse
thee
thou
child
of
all
unrighteousness
art
thou
not
already
cursed
among
the
children
of
men
where
are
the
wealth
and
the
cheerfulness
where
are
the
welcome
and
the
faces
of
joy
and
mirth
that
are
to
be
met
with
at
the
houses
of
thy
kinsmen
whose
bread
i
eat
where
the
full
basket
and
the
welcome
store
the
wine
that
giveth
its
colour
in
the
glass
the
sounds
of
mirth
and
gladness
the
sounds
of
the
song
the
viol
and
the
harp
and
where
is
thy
tongue
that
thou
canst
not
speak
cried
the
friar
elevating
his
voice
to
its
highest
and
most
impatient
tones
humph
said
gourlay
humph
returned
the
friar
what
dost
thou
mean
by
humph
tell
me
in
one
word
art
thou
the
lord
of
this
castle
no
but
his
seneschal
said
gourlay
what
hast
thou
to
say
then
lead
me
to
thy
master
that
i
may
see
him
face
to
face
and
tell
him
the
words
of
him
that
sent
me
i
will
not
be
afraid
of
these
dogs
of
thine
and
thy
master
what
is
become
of
thy
tongue
that
thou
dost
not
speak
tell
me
i
say
can
i
see
thy
master
perhaps
said
gourlay
and
seizing
the
friar
by
the
shoulder
with
a
rude
but
powerful
grasp
he
dragged
him
in
at
the
gate
thine
hand
and
thy
unmannerly
grasp
said
the
friar
else
i
will
smite
thee
with
the
sword
the
seneschal
regarded
this
threat
only
with
a
grim
unmeaning
smile
and
as
he
held
the
friar
by
the
right
arm
so
firmly
that
he
even
lost
the
power
of
it
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
draw
his
sword
nay
but
hearken
unto
me
continued
he
surely
it
is
better
for
thee
to
live
than
to
die
therefore
bring
in
my
beast
that
he
may
have
provender
and
let
me
also
bring
my
goods
and
my
changes
of
raiment
along
with
me
in
peace
else
how
shall
i
set
up
my
face
before
thy
master
the
seneschal
then
paused
and
motioned
with
his
hand
to
the
pages
to
bring
the
panniers
they
ran
to
obey
but
as
soon
as
any
of
them
touched
the
huge
wallet
he
hastened
back
and
fell
to
the
ground
vermin
can
not
you
bring
the
furniture
cried
gourlay
they
shook
their
heads
and
stood
at
a
distance
humph
said
he
i
do
not
comprehend
this
and
leading
the
friar
back
still
holding
him
fast
by
the
arm
he
suffered
him
to
lift
the
panniers
himself
which
he
did
with
good
will
and
then
allowed
himself
to
be
led
away
by
the
uncourteous
seneschal
who
said
to
the
pages
as
he
departed
see
to
the
vile
animal
without
more
ado
he
led
the
friar
in
and
pushing
him
rudely
into
a
small
vaulted
apartment
he
locked
first
a
ponderous
iron
door
and
then
a
massy
wooden
one
full
of
nails
upon
him
and
without
regarding
his
complaints
or
anathemas
or
deigning
a
word
in
reply
to
his
queries
he
left
him
to
his
own
bitter
reflections
the
apartment
at
first
appeared
to
be
dark
but
on
looking
about
he
found
that
there
were
two
grated
in
it
and
by
the
light
from
these
he
soon
perceived
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
place
save
the
skeleton
of
a
man
of
uncommon
stature
and
dimensions
the
bones
were
lying
flat
on
the
floor
every
one
in
its
place
exactly
as
the
man
had
died
and
the
flesh
wasted
away
from
them
no
disarrangement
had
taken
place
nor
was
the
smallest
joint
wanting
this
was
a
petrifying
sight
to
the
poor
friar
who
crossing
himself
and
turning
from
the
horrible
spectacle
set
his
nose
through
the
grating
and
looked
out
on
the
fields
the
first
thing
he
beheld
confounded
him
more
than
all
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
the
three
devilish
pages
were
tampering
with
his
mule
to
bring
him
within
the
outer
gate
but
he
in
his
usual
manner
proved
as
refractory
as
ever
and
laid
about
him
with
all
his
might
on
this
the
boys
in
one
moment
whipped
him
up
in
their
arms
and
ere
the
friar
could
draw
his
breath
far
less
utter
a
they
set
him
down
in
the
middle
of
the
court
straight
before
the
friar
grating
and
tied
him
to
the
shaft
of
a
well
with
a
strong
rope
the
friar
said
a
benedicite
and
ere
he
had
done
the
devilish
and
provoking
imps
began
to
torment
the
poor
mule
beyond
all
sufferance
whipping
him
round
and
round
the
post
and
making
him
fling
and
jump
till
the
blood
and
sweat
were
pouring
together
from
his
branded
sides
and
he
was
no
more
able
to
resent
the
injuries
committed
on
him
the
friar
fumed
and
threatened
and
cursed
them
in
the
name
of
the
blessed
saints
but
they
only
laughed
him
to
scorn
and
when
the
mule
could
no
longer
resent
the
lash
they
brought
spindles
and
pushed
them
between
his
which
made
him
fling
and
rear
till
he
fell
down
at
the
post
and
lay
groaning
unable
any
more
to
move
the
thing
that
provoked
the
friar
worst
of
all
was
the
sight
of
the
tall
seneschal
standing
looking
on
and
seeming
by
his
motions
to
be
directing
the
game
never
was
such
a
flood
of
eastern
eloquence
heard
at
aikwood
as
was
poured
from
the
small
crevice
in
the
bottom
of
the
eastern
turret
that
evening
no
one
however
regarded
it
or
if
they
did
it
was
only
to
mock
or
mimic
the
sublime
deprecator
to
all
that
he
said
the
seneschal
grinned
a
smile
of
grim
disdain
and
motioned
to
the
pages
to
redouble
their
sport
which
they
did
till
as
said
the
poor
animal
could
furnish
them
with
no
more
the
friar
now
beheld
a
joyful
sight
through
the
twilight
the
rest
of
his
companions
coming
on
foot
towards
the
gate
they
had
gathered
together
at
the
mill
about
a
mile
to
the
eastward
of
the
castle
and
made
another
attempt
to
approach
it
on
horseback
but
their
efforts
were
vain
not
a
steed
would
come
one
step
farther
than
just
in
view
of
it
so
they
agreed
to
put
their
horses
up
at
the
mill
leaving
them
in
charge
of
the
miller
and
his
two
sons
and
to
proceed
on
foot
to
the
castle
to
join
their
mysterious
associate
the
friar
whose
magical
might
some
of
them
began
to
dread
and
others
to
trust
gourlay
beheld
them
approaching
as
well
as
did
the
friar
and
again
waited
on
the
great
master
with
awe
and
trembling
i
pray
thee
mighty
master
to
forgive
me
said
he
but
too
true
is
it
that
the
wretched
pedagogue
has
said
for
here
come
a
body
of
the
warden
friends
with
swords
in
their
hands
and
one
beautiful
human
thing
in
their
company
and
what
then
said
michael
in
a
stern
hollow
voice
the
seneschal
trembled
i
i
only
want
to
know
how
they
are
to
be
received
said
he
received
cried
the
master
raising
his
voice
to
a
pitch
that
made
the
old
wretch
shrink
as
it
were
within
himself
received
as
spies
should
to
be
sure
begone
gourlay
ran
cowering
toward
the
door
come
back
here
what
forces
are
in
the
castle
what
forces
hem
great
master
you
only
know
any
things
of
flesh
i
inquire
no
not
one
if
you
except
the
old
witch
henbane
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
great
and
honoured
master
i
meant
your
worthy
and
respectable
housekeeper
michael
gave
three
gentle
tramps
with
his
heel
and
in
one
moment
the
three
pages
in
black
livery
prig
prim
and
pricker
were
at
his
knee
work
master
work
what
work
now
said
they
all
in
one
breath
give
your
master
there
a
toasting
for
his
insolence
said
michael
the
pages
giggled
for
joy
the
seneschal
kneeled
and
roared
out
for
mercy
and
as
a
motive
for
granting
it
to
him
said
the
strangers
were
at
the
gate
the
pages
had
already
laid
their
fangs
on
him
but
the
master
on
the
arrival
of
the
strangers
being
brought
to
his
mind
ordered
the
imps
to
desist
this
they
did
on
the
instant
but
without
delay
rushed
on
michael
himself
as
if
they
would
tear
him
to
pieces
he
threatened
cursed
and
dared
them
to
touch
him
but
they
seemed
nothing
daunted
by
all
he
said
but
danced
around
him
with
demoniac
gestures
crying
still
out
with
one
voice
work
master
work
work
we
need
work
for
the
living
or
for
the
dead
since
we
are
called
work
we
will
have
for
the
master
or
for
the
slave
work
master
work
what
work
now
miserable
wight
that
i
am
cried
the
mighty
master
then
d
d
dwarfs
since
it
must
be
so
bring
the
slave
back
and
let
him
have
three
varieties
and
no
more
gourlay
had
made
his
escape
with
all
expedition
but
it
was
not
long
ere
they
overtook
him
and
brought
him
back
leading
him
in
the
most
grotesque
manner
that
can
well
be
conceived
they
then
began
to
twirl
him
about
first
with
his
face
one
way
and
then
another
and
latest
adventures
making
the
strongest
impressions
on
their
wicked
imaginations
by
some
devilish
slight
they
transformed
him
into
the
shape
of
a
mule
and
practised
on
him
all
the
wanton
cruelties
they
had
so
lately
done
on
the
friar
seeming
to
enjoy
the
sport
all
the
while
with
redoubled
zest
they
next
changed
him
into
a
dog
and
tying
a
cannister
containing
some
small
stones
to
his
tail
they
pursued
him
round
and
round
the
room
and
finally
out
into
the
yard
with
long
whips
every
one
breaking
at
him
and
giving
him
a
lash
as
he
came
by
this
caused
him
always
now
and
then
to
exert
himself
with
such
speed
that
the
cannister
was
sometimes
hitting
him
on
the
head
with
a
loud
rattling
yerk
sometimes
on
the
back
and
all
over
the
body
while
the
poor
steward
was
running
yelping
in
the
uttermost
desperation
the
friar
beheld
part
of
the
sport
from
his
grate
but
little
wist
that
it
was
the
hated
seneschal
that
was
suffering
else
he
would
have
doubtless
enjoyed
the
scene
in
no
ordinary
degree
the
rest
of
the
embassy
also
saw
it
from
the
outer
gate
where
they
now
stood
rapping
and
calling
without
being
regarded
the
pages
being
too
intent
on
their
game
to
pay
the
least
attention
to
such
as
they
let
alane
the
poor
tike
like
good
lads
cried
muckle
charlie
and
come
and
open
the
yett
what
ill
has
the
silly
beast
done
to
you
they
bring
me
in
mind

terriers
said
gibbie
that

for

than

was
good
or
right
for

poet
there

or

in
it

charlie
corby
wadna

them
and
he
kens
things
gayan
weel
we
maun
just
hae
a
wee
patience
till
they
be
done
wi
their
chace
it
a
queer
kind
o
place
this
the
poor
metamorphosed
steward
finding
no
rest
for
the
sole
of
his
foot
betook
him
again
to
the
staircase
and
crept
down
at
his
feet
deeming
the
chastisement
to
have
been
over
but
he
was
no
sooner
there
than
the
pages
were
after
him
and
by
the
time
they
had
whirled
him
three
times
about
he
started
up
a
hare
and
the
three
pages
turning
themselves
into
colley
dogs
set
all
upon
him
with
the
form
of
every
quadruped
into
the
shape
of
which
he
was
turned
he
seemed
to
acquire
its
nature
and
antipathies
and
in
none
was
it
so
striking
as
in
the
hare
when
the
collies
began
to
snap
at
him
his
terror
is
not
to
be
imagined
he
darted
round
and
round
the
hall
like
lightning
breaking
out
and
in
to
michael
study
to
the
great
disarrangement
of
his
conjuring
apparatus
books
and
papers
while
every
time
that
a
colley
sprung
with
open
mouth
at
him
he
uttered
a
desperate
scream
this
was
the
only
one
of
their
frolics
that
appeared
to
amuse
the
great
master
his
partiality
for
the
sports
of
the
chase
being
proverbial
to
this
day
when
he
saw
the
old
seneschal
laying
back
his
long
ears
and
exerting
his
powers
of
speed
in
such
manifest
terror
and
the
malignant
collies
whinking
after
him
and
waylaying
him
in
every
strait
making
him
often
spring
aloft
he
could
not
help
laughing
outright
and
baiting
the
dogs
on
him
the
tears
stood
in
the
old
hare
eyes
when
he
heard
this
nevertheless
his
fright
made
him
agile
he
bolted
from
the
halls
and
alleys
of
the
castle
into
the
extensive
yard
and
there
was
such
a
hunt
michael
and
the
friar
both
ran
to
their
respective
windows
to
see
the
sport
and
our
party
at
the
outer
gate
shouted
and
hallooed
with
great
energy
many
a
time
did
the
dogs
get
a
snap
at
the
steward
and
make
him
scream
out
while
all
the
onlookers
laughed
aloud
at
length
thinking
he
would
actually
be
worried
he
cleared
the
wall
and
made
a
bold
effort
to
gain
the
wood
but
these
were
a
trio
of
dogs
from
which
there
was
no
possibility
of
escape
ran
he
fast
or
ran
he
slow
there
were
they
after
him
snatching
at
his
hips
and
panting
sides
and
yelping
so
keenly
all
the
while
that
the
seneschal
had
no
doubt
of
being
torn
in
pieces
should
they
fairly
seize
him
they
turned
him
and
made
him
trace
many
an
acute
angle
on
the
hill
while
our
party
were
running
after
him
throwing
always
sticks
or
stones
at
the
steward
as
he
hasted
by
them
and
baiting
the
dogs
on
him
finding
as
formerly
no
other
resource
he
returned
with
main
speed
to
the
castle
and
crept
down
at
the
master
feet
who
with
one
touch
of
his
divining
rod
changed
him
into
his
own
native
forbidding
form
he
started
up
in
great
wrath
and
though
panting
so
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
swore
a
horrible
oath
that
he
would
no
longer
be
kept
in
bondage
and
maltreated
in
that
manner
and
that
since
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
escape
in
any
other
way
he
would
cut
his
own
throat
and
run
his
chance
of
an
after
life
poor
dastardly
braggart
said
michael
not
for
the
soul
that
inhabits
that
old
malicious
frame
dare
you
do
such
a
thing
i
would
seize
on
it
and
make
sport
of
it
for
ages
i
have
you
wholly
in
my
power
and
dead
or
alive
it
is
the
same
thing
to
me
were
you
to
do
as
you
say
and
take
away
your
life
by
a
ghastly
wound
i
could
even
make
one
of
these
fiendish
spirits
enter
into
your
body
it
and
cause
you
to
go
about
with
your
gaping
wound
unclosed
and
unpurified
as
when
death
entered
thereat
think
of
what
an
existence
that
would
be
and
then
go
and
put
your
miserable
threat
into
execution
hah
there
it
is
said
gourlay
turn
me
as
i
will
i
see
nothing
but
wretchedness
cursed
be
the
day
that
i
saw
you
and
ten
times
cursed
the
confession
i
made
that
has
thus
subjected
me
to
your
tyranny
however
use
me
another
day
as
you
have
used
me
on
this
and
you
do
it
at
your
peril
if
you
were
the
devil
himself
i
have
warned
you
michael
only
smiled
contemptuously
at
the
threat
and
again
asked
what
living
creatures
were
in
the
castle
as
he
wanted
a
retinue
to
receive
the
message
of
his
kinsmen
i
have
told
you
already
said
gourlay
in
the
same
passionate
and
irritated
mood
and
i
again
repeat
it
that
there
is
no
mortal
thing
in
the
castle
but
the
old
witch
and
perhaps
two
or
three
hundred
rats
take
that
in
the
first
place
then
said
michael
for
your
impertinence
at
the
same
time
laying
him
flat
on
the
floor
by
a
tremendous
blow
although
he
only
moved
his
hand
toward
the
steward
and
in
the
next
place
go
call
out
these
three
hundred
rats
you
talk
of
marshal
them
up
in
the
court
and
receive
the
mighty
warden
people
with
all
manner
of
pomp
and
respect
and
use
them
according
to
their
demerits
the
steward
roared
out
with
pain
and
gnashing
his
teeth
with
rage
he
arose
growling
and
was
hasting
away
when
the
master
asked
him
if
he
was
going
to
accomplish
what
he
had
bidden
him
do
without
doubt
said
he
is
it
not
very
likely
that
i
shall
be
able
take
that
then
said
the
master
and
put
it
above
the
of
the
door
it
shall
serve
you
as
a
summons
and
prig
prim
and
pricker
shall
marshal
your
array
with
that
he
gave
him
a
small
piece
of
parchment
written
in
red
characters
which
the
steward
snatched
angrily
out
of
his
hand
and
going
down
the
stair
did
as
the
master
had
ordered
him
the
charm
was
effective
and
its
effects
momentary
the
bustling
and
the
screaming
of
rats
were
heard
in
every
corner
of
the
castle
and
forthwith
a
whole
column
of
men
marched
out
into
the
court
in
three
files
led
by
the
three
pages
and
headed
by
the
incensed
seneschal
in
his
grey
mantle
and
cap
our
messengers
looked
mightily
astonished
when
they
beheld
such
a
retinue
and
charlie
observed
that
it
was
a
confounded
shame
for
mr
michael
no
to
join
the
warden
and
had
sae
mony
idle
men
lying
tholing
starvation
beside
him
but
then
looking
wildly
around
on
both
sides
to
his
friends
he
added
god
grace
be
about
us
wha
kens
but
a
thae
may
be
spirits
or
elves
in
the
shapes
i
think
they
hae
unco
queer
looks
an
i
had
corby
here
he
wad
soon
tell
me
wi
a
vengeance
old
gourlay
now
at
the
head
of
his
corps
demanded
what
the
strangers
wanted
and
on
being
informed
who
they
were
and
that
they
came
on
a
special
commission
to
the
master
they
were
admitted
and
walked
up
a
lane
between
two
ranks
of
armed
men
in
full
caparison
the
master
beheld
them
from
his
casement
and
was
mightily
diverted
by
the
whimsical
appearance
of
the
various
individuals
that
formed
the
group
two
of
whom
he
conceived
to
be
the
most
beautiful
creatures
he
had
ever
seen
whoever
reads
this
will
at
once
guess
who
these
two
lovely
beings
were
but
if
he
does
he
will
at
once
guess
wrong
it
would
seem
that
a
wizard
sees
every
thing
in
this
fair
and
beautiful
creation
through
an
inverted
medium
and
that
all
the
common
and
fine
feelings
of
nature
are
in
him
changed
and
distorted
the
beauty
of
the
two
young
captives
appeared
in
michael
eyes
hateful
and
even
affected
him
with
loathing
but
two
more
lovely
and
engaging
creatures
than
jordan
and
the
deil
tam
he
had
never
seen
on
earth
the
hooked
nose
wrinkled
face
and
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
of
the
laird
he
thought
exquisite
but
tam
long
coulter
nose
turned
up
in
front
his
small
grey
eyes
and
shapeless
physiognomy
were
beyond
all
expression
engaging
so
from
the
time
that
the
master
got
the
first
look
of
them
he
determined
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
to
see
and
converse
with
his
guests
they
were
soon
conducted
to
the
door
of
the
vault
in
which
their
friend
the
friar
was
immured
and
as
soon
as
the
door
opened
he
exclaimed
with
a
loud
voice
i
charge
you
o
my
brethren
and
my
companions
that
ye
come
not
into
this
place
nor
set
a
foot
within
its
boundaries
for
the
place
is
a
place
of
death
and
the
bones
of
the
dead
men
are
in
it
there
is
no
deciding
what
these
words
might
have
produced
had
they
been
pronounced
in
time
but
as
soon
as
charlie
and
the
laird
who
were
foremost
heard
the
friar
voice
they
rushed
towards
him
without
thought
or
fear
of
the
consequences
and
ere
he
had
done
the
hindmost
were
pushed
in
by
the
relentless
arm
of
the
seneschal
and
the
iron
door
closed
behind
them
perceiving
how
matters
stood
the
friar
straight
lifted
up
his
hands
and
continued
to
declaim
in
a
still
more
fervent
stile
hout
gude
lord
friar
man
haud
your
tongue
said
charlie
interrupting
him
what
signifies
making
sic
a
frase
as
a
this
or
what
good
will
it
do
i
hae
run
mysel
into
mony
a
priminary
in
my
life
but
i
never
fand
that
mony
words
did
muckle
good
i
trowed
that
ye
had
mair
art
about
ye
than
to
be
feared
for
a
stane
an
lime
wa
an
twa
or
three
airn
staincheons
pith
can
do
muckle
but
art
can
do
mair
charlie
meant
the
black
art
but
the
friar
taking
him
up
in
another
meaning
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
blessed
him
it
may
not
have
occurred
to
the
reader
and
it
is
not
likely
it
should
that
this
same
friar
was
an
english
monk
the
most
celebrated
man
of
that
age
then
exiled
from
his
country
and
obliged
to
skulk
in
disguise
for
fear
of
being
apprehended
and
burnt
as
a
wizard
and
necromancer
he
was
the
greatest
philosopher
and
chemist
of
the
age
the
real
inventor
of
and
many
other
wonderful
discoveries
and
withal
a
pious
and
good
man
although
one
whose
character
was
tinctured
with
peculiarities
so
striking
that
some
took
him
for
a
man
crazed
in
his
mind
but
far
more
for
a
powerful
necromancer
his
name
is
familiar
to
every
man
in
the
least
acquainted
with
the
literature
or
the
science
of
that
age
but
while
he
remained
in
scotland
being
always
denominated
the
gospel
friar
we
have
judged
it
best
to
call
him
by
that
name
if
the
reader
has
not
discovered
this
it
is
time
he
should
know
it
and
whether
the
friar
was
a
necromancer
or
not
will
appear
in
the
sequel
when
the
party
got
leisure
to
converse
together
their
first
words
were
expressive
of
the
astonishment
they
laboured
under
at
sight
of
the
warlike
force
kept
up
by
the
master
charlie
only
testified
his
regret
that
there
was
not
a
right
and
mutual
understanding
between
him
and
the
warden
but
the
maid
delany
was
the
first
to
remark
that
she
did
not
think
they
were
right
men
because
their
faces
were
all
alike
and
their
eyes
were
not
like
the
eyes
of
any
human
being
she
had
ever
before
looked
on
in
this
every
one
present
acquiesced
and
great
was
their
wonder
how
or
whence
that
mighty
armed
force
had
sprung
but
they
agreed
that
there
was
no
contending
with
such
numbers
of
whatsoever
nature
they
might
be
and
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
submitting
to
the
master
will
the
day
light
was
by
this
time
quite
extinguished
but
the
moon
was
up
and
it
being
a
hard
frost
with
a
slight
covering
of
snow
or
rime
it
was
nearly
as
light
as
some
winter
days
their
damp
mouldy
vault
with
the
grisly
skeleton
lying
at
the
one
side
of
it
shewed
horridly
dismal
in
the
wan
and
shadowy
light
and
threw
a
chillness
over
their
hearts
they
hoped
and
looked
long
for
dinner
and
then
for
supper
but
neither
of
them
came
nor
did
they
hear
or
see
any
living
thing
all
that
night
save
the
friar
mule
that
had
again
got
to
his
feet
and
stood
at
the
post
groaning
and
trembling
of
cold
this
was
a
grievous
sight
to
the
friar
for
his
heart
was
moved
for
the
sufferings
of
his
poor
beast
and
in
the
bitterness
of
his
spirit
he
vented
some
anathemas
against
the
unconscionable
seneschal
saying
verily
if
ever
that
son
of
belial
fall
into
my
hands
i
will
be
unto
him
as
adramelech
and
as
sharezer
and
do
unto
him
as
they
did
to
the
father
that
begat
them
every
time
that
charlie
looked
out
at
the
mule
he
testified
a
sort
of
inward
satisfaction
that
his
own
trusty
steed
was
not
brought
into
the
same
scrape
and
sundry
times
said
gude
faith
corby
kend
better
sense
than
coming
into
sic
a
place
as
this
is
he
as
weel
off
down
wi
the
auld
miller
he
get
some
pluffins
o
seeds
or
dust
poor
fallow
an
they
gie
him
but
water
i
no
feared
for
him
for
there
plenty
meat
yonder
but
he
never
do
if
they
let
him
want
water
about
two
in
the
morning
the
seneschal
entered
with
a
light
but
had
the
precaution
to
lock
the
wooden
door
before
he
opened
the
iron
one
the
prisoners
had
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
were
leaning
on
one
another
and
dismal
as
their
lodging
was
some
of
them
had
fallen
sound
asleep
delany
was
leaning
on
the
friar
breast
and
the
poet
had
laid
himself
down
behind
her
and
covered
her
with
his
mantle
the
rest
were
huddled
together
so
that
they
appeared
to
be
lying
above
one
another
but
all
or
most
of
them
set
up
their
heads
at
the
entrance
of
the
steward
tam
was
the
first
to
address
him
what
come
o
our
supper
goodman
that
you
are
coming
do
you
no
think
it
is
time
your
guests
had
something
to
eat
or
hae
ye
naething
either
to
eat
or
drink
in
this
great
gousty
castle
i
dinna
care
what
ye
may
think
or
what
you
may
say
but
in
my
opinion
you
and
your
master
baith
are
naething
but
twa
unmannerly
niggards
the
seneschal
grinned
disdain
and
clenched
his
teeth
in
wrath
he
was
about
to
reply
but
all
their
tongues
were
loosed
on
him
at
once
some
complaining
of
one
thing
some
of
another
and
the
friar
more
particularly
of
the
treatment
of
his
beast
all
however
ended
with
a
request
for
meat
no
said
gourlay
we
have
no
meat
for
spies
and
forayers
a
halter
is
the
only
guerdon
we
bestow
on
such
dogs
i
want
this
fair
maiden
and
for
the
rest
of
you
he
finished
the
sentence
with
a
sneer
and
a
point
with
his
finger
to
the
bones
and
seizing
the
maid
by
the
shoulder
he
dragged
her
toward
the
door
softly
sir
and
if
you
please
said
the
poet
speaking
in
pure
iambics
and
seizing
the
bars
of
the
iron
door
before
the
steward
and
his
prize
we
have
indeed
this
maiden
brought
from
distant
camp
and
knight
renowned
unto
the
master
of
this
house
and
to
none
else
we
give
her
up
no
not
to
thee
nor
arm
of
flesh
as
the
poet
said
these
words
he
bristled
up
and
faced
the
steward
at
the
door
to
keep
him
back
but
the
carl
gave
him
such
a
blow
on
the
temples
that
he
staggered
and
fell
the
friar
then
interposed
and
though
he
was
a
strong
and
powerful
man
the
irascible
steward
plied
his
blows
so
fast
and
so
hard
about
his
bare
pate
that
he
was
also
overthrown
the
maiden
screamed
and
the
old
incendiary
was
within
a
hairbreadth
of
having
her
outside
of
the
iron
door
when
she
would
have
been
wholly
out
of
the
power
of
her
friends
and
protectors
but
at
that
critical
instant
charlie
scott
seized
the
steward
by
the
arm
never
doubting
but
that
he
would
twist
him
like
a
willow
but
he
was
mistaken
the
churl
seized
him
by
the
throat
with
his
left
hand
with
such
prodigious
force
that
charlie
deemed
him
to
have
the
strength
of
six
common
men
and
lending
him
a
blow
on
the
face
he
made
his
mouth
and
nose
to
gush
blood
charlie
returned
the
salute
with
interest
yet
the
steward
stood
his
ground
and
a
most
desperate
struggle
ensued
in
which
victory
appeared
doubtful
gibby
perceiving
his
friend
and
champion
jeopardy
drew
out
his
sword
and
was
going
deliberately
to
stick
the
old
ragamuffin
behind
had
not
charlie
called
out
furiously
to
him
to
forbear
keep
back
your
whittle
you
cowardly
dog
cried
he
else
i
cut
you
into
a
thousand
pieces
i
never
yet
took
odds
against
a
man
nor
shall
i
now
unless
i
am
fighting
wi
the
devil
in
that
case
i
may
measure
my
backbreadth
on
the
floor
but
be
he
the
devil
be
he
dicken
i
shall
gie
him
ae
squeeze
charlie
with
that
closed
with
his
dangerous
opponent
and
gave
him
such
a
squeeze
that
he
made
his
back
and
ribs
to
crash
the
steward
twisted
his
face
into
the
most
hideous
contortions
and
exerted
his
whole
force
to
extricate
himself
but
charlie
brought
him
to
the
ground
falling
upon
him
with
all
his
ponderous
weight
it
was
among
the
bones
of
the
gigantic
skeleton
that
the
two
combatants
fell
and
charlie
deeming
that
he
had
given
his
foe
enough
for
once
and
a
little
startled
to
find
himself
among
the
rattling
bones
began
to
unloose
his
grasp
and
said
in
a
hurried
way
billy
i
learn
you
how
to
strike
on
the
gab
and
the
brigg
o
the
nose
sae
rashly
and
was
getting
up
as
fast
as
he
could
when
the
steward
gave
him
such
a
blow
with
the
of
the
dead
man
that
he
had
very
nigh
brought
him
down
again
if
bonnet
had
not
had
a
bar
or
two
of
steel
that
blow
would
have
shattered
his
skull
as
it
was
it
stunned
him
a
little
and
made
the
water
start
into
his
eyes
and
he
had
just
recollection
and
strength
sufficient
to
secure
his
adversary
arms
by
holding
them
down
so
that
he
might
not
repeat
the
blow
yet
with
all
this
charlie
temper
was
not
to
be
ruffled
he
cared
not
how
often
or
how
much
he
fought
but
he
never
fought
in
wrath
gude
faith
my
man
said
he
but
ye
no
nice
o
your
chapping
sticks
and
foul
fa
me
gin
ye
dinna
lay
them
gayan
freely
on
but
i
dinna
blame
ye
a
wight
man
never
wants
a
weapon
only
come
that
gate
again
an
ye
dare
the
steward
growled
and
cursed
trying
all
that
he
could
to
throw
charlie
from
above
him
and
master
him
by
sheer
strength
he
had
no
idea
of
being
overpowered
by
a
single
arm
nor
was
he
wont
to
fear
half
a
dozen
but
he
had
never
met
with
the
like
of
charlie
scott
before
he
might
as
well
have
tried
to
remove
the
hill
of
aikwood
so
he
was
obliged
to
succumb
which
he
did
with
a
very
bad
grace
nor
would
he
either
abate
one
inch
in
his
demand
of
having
the
damsel
unconditionally
or
grant
one
request
that
they
desired
of
him
why
then
there
nae
help
for
it
honest
man
said
charlie
i
hae

firm
and
fast
and
what

winna

and

a
spauld
against

and
as
for
his
tongue
we
maun
just
let
it
wag
the
rage
of
the
seneschal
when
he
saw
himself
robbed
of
the
keys
of
the
castle
is
not
to
be
described
he
cursed
and
raged
in
such
a
manner
that
even
after
the
friar
had
both
doors
fairly
open
charlie
durst
not
move
from
off
him
or
let
him
go
for
fear
of
some
deadly
scaith
i
dinna
ken
what
i

he

o

and
fuffing

pierced
said
gibbie
the
friar
then
took
up
his
bulky
baggage
and
walked
out
with
that
and
the
light
meaning
to
bring
his
mule
halter
wherewith
to
bind
the
seneschal
but
charlie
making
his
escape
from
him
locked
him
in
and
thus
were
our
messengers
left
in
the
full
and
free
possession
of
the
castle
of
aikwood
chapter
ii
the
lady
looked
the
castle
wa
she
looked
both
pale
and
wan
for
the
door
was
locked
and
the
lord
within
he
was
no
christian
man
of
may
when
the
steward
saw
that
he
was
fairly
mastered
and
that
neither
strength
nor
words
could
avail
him
ought
he
remained
where
he
was
in
sullen
silence
he
had
got
no
orders
from
the
master
to
bring
him
the
maid
but
it
had
come
into
his
head
to
go
and
take
her
to
himself
and
he
had
nearly
effected
his
purpose
what
might
have
been
the
consequence
of
his
success
it
is
painful
even
to
calculate
but
he
was
thus
prevented
though
not
without
blood
and
wounds
the
guests
now
traversed
all
the
lower
apartments
of
the
castle
there
being
neither
bolt
nor
bar
to
interrupt
them
but
for
all
the
retinue
that
they
had
seen
at
their
arrival
there
was
neither
the
appearance
of
man
nor
beast
remaining
the
large
hall
did
not
seem
to
have
been
occupied
for
a
long
period
the
shelves
were
empty
and
there
were
neither
dishes
nor
fragments
of
meat
of
any
description
and
every
thing
within
as
well
as
without
the
castle
had
the
appearance
of
desolation
at
length
they
came
to
a
door
from
the
bottom
of
which
they
perceived
some
light
issuing
of
which
they
were
glad
as
they
were
afraid
the
steward
lamp
would
fail
them
and
leave
them
in
darkness
deeming
themselves
on
ticklish
ground
they
consulted
in
a
whisper
before
venturing
in
charlie
scott
was
quite
a
fearless
man
among
his
fellow
creatures
but
all
kinds
of
supernatural
agency
pressed
heavily
on
his
conscience
therefore
in
the
present
instance
he
dissuaded
his
comrades
from
entering
with
all
his
eloquence
gude
faith
callans
keep
back
off
that
place
it
is
the
warlock
room
and
gin
he
should
be
in
the
mids
o
some
o
his
cantrips
at
this
eiry
time
o
the
morning
gude
sauf
us
it
is
a
question
what
might
be
the
upshot
na
na
friar
i
tell
ye
bide
back
it
is
best
to
let
sleeping
dogs
lye
for
fear
they
get
up
and
bite
you
but
the
friar
creed
differed
from
that
of
charlie
and
he
went
dauntlessly
forward
putting
him
aside
with
his
hand
and
saying
at
the
same
time
that
he
would
surely
go
in
unto
him
as
with
a
front
of
brass
or
of
iron
that
sooner
or
later
the
time
and
the
season
of
their
meeting
must
come
and
why
should
he
be
dismayed
the
friar
then
opened
the
door
with
caution
and
entered
followed
by
all
his
associates
charlie
scott
bringing
up
the
rear
and
whispering
to
those
next
him
in
a
tremulous
voice
od
that
body
mad
he
lead
us
into
some
snapper
dinna
be
ower
rash
callans
just
look
afore
ye
instead
of
the
great
enchanter
however
they
found
only
an
old
woman
so
busily
engaged
with
something
on
the
fire
that
she
scarcely
deigned
to
regard
them
as
they
entered
she
had
a
wooden
tube
like
the
barrel
of
a
gun
with
which
she
blew
up
her
fire
and
she
kept
blowing
at
it
till
the
flame
came
above
the
lip
of
her
caldron
and
let
her
see
into
it
for
she
had
no
lamp
nor
any
other
light
save
that
which
came
from
the
fire
when
she
had
made
it
blaze
thus
high
she
spoke
to
herself
and
without
taking
her
mouth
from
the
tube
saying
some
words
to
the
following
purport
sotter
sotter
my
wee
pan
to
the
spirit
gin
ye
can
when
the
scum
turns
blue
and
the
blood
bells
through
there
something
aneath
that
will
change
the
man
when
charlie
saw
her
face
and
heard
her
mumbling
these
horrid
words
through
her
long
hollow
tube
he
turned
his
back
and
fled
taking
shelter
in
a
void
entrance
to
which
he
was
led
by
some
light
that
fell
into
it
from
the
rays
of
the
moon
full
hardly
was
he
then
bested
for
he
still
deemed
that
he
heard
the
witch
rites
at
a
distance
and
the
faint
ray
of
the
moon
through
a
narrow
aperture
made
the
rest
of
the
space
appear
so
shadowy
and
dim
that
charlie
saw
he
was
in
a
dangerous
situation
and
actually
began
to
fancy
he
beheld
a
face
in
the
dark
staring
at
him
and
still
coming
nearer
it
was
no
time
to
stand
there
so
he
fled
with
all
his
might
but
in
his
dismay
he
lost
every
kind
of
aim
or
consideration
whither
he
was
going
and
at
once
stumbled
on
the
undermost
step
of
a
stone
stair
thinking
the
apparition
he
had
seen
was
by
that
time
hard
upon
him
and
no
other
way
that
he
knew
of
open
for
flight
he
rose
and
pursued
his
course
straight
up
stairs
in
a
state
of
perturbation
hardly
to
be
accounted
for
the
first
landing
place
that
he
came
to
he
ran
himself
against
a
door
and
not
finding
farther
entrance
he
faced
about
and
leaning
over
the
balluster
he
set
up
such
a
yell
as
never
was
before
breathed
from
lungs
it
is
true
he
neither
heard
nor
saw
aught
of
the
apparition
but
charlie
was
a
sensible
man
and
he
was
certain
it
might
be
there
for
any
thing
that
he
knew
so
he
set
up
the
same
kind
of
cry
that
he
was
wont
to
do
when
he
lost
his
neighbours
in
a
mist
or
in
a
night
foray
only
about
ten
times
or
so
louder

charlie
was
now
at
such
a
distance
from
his
comrades
who
were
still
in
the
witch
small
apartment
and
the
echoes
of
the
huge
void
castle
so
confused
the
sounds
that
they
took
the
cries
of
their
captain
for
the
rushing
of
a
whirlwind
roaring
through
the
crannies
of
the
castle
and
paid
no
regard
to
them
no
state
could
be
more
deplorable
than
that
in
which
muckle
charlie
scott
was
now
placed
to
have
returned
down
the
stair
would
have
been
meeting
the
devil
face
to
face
or
as
charlie
much
better
expressed
it
to
hae
dabbed
nebs
wi
the
deil
he
had
therefore
no
other
resource
than
to
bellow
out
for
assistance
and
seeing
none
approach
he
said
aloud
in
great
agony
of
spirit

not
satisfied
with
giving
yelloch
after
yelloch
as
he
termed
his
loud
cries
he
flew
to
every
door
on
the
landing
place
laid
on
it
with
his
fists
and
kicked
it
with
his
foot
calling
at
each
of
them
in
the
same
key
as
before
is
there
ony
body
here
he
at
last
prevailed
one
door
was
opened
and
he
was
admitted
inside
but
alas
for
our
gallant
yeoman
he
only
by
this
transition
got
out
of
one
exceedingly
bad
scrape
into
a
worse
these
casual
separations
of
are
exceedingly
unfortunate
for
the
who
aims
at
conciseness
and
brevity
because
it
is
impracticable
to
bring
them
all
on
at
the
same
time
a
story
is
like
a
waggoner
and
his
horses
travelling
out
the
highway
his
machine
loaden
with
various
bales
of
rich
merchandise
he
goes
smoothly
and
regularly
on
till
he
comes
to
the
bottom
of
a
steep
ascent
where
he
is
obliged
to
leave
a
great
proportion
of
his
loading
and
first
carry
one
part
of
it
to
the
top
of
the
hill
then
another
and
then
another
which
retards
him
grievously
on
his
way
so
is
it
with
the
writer
of
a
true
history
such
as
this
and
the
separation
of
parties
is
as
a
hill
on
his
onward
path
it
is
otherwise
with
dramatic
representations
and
in
these
the
authors
have
a
great
advantage
let
their
characters
separate
as
they
will
or
be
engaged
as
they
will
they
can
at
any
time
with
the
greatest
ease
be
brought
together
on
the
stage
the
one
enters
from
the
one
side
and
the
other
from
the
other
and
we
do
not
much
concern
ourselves
how
or
whence
they
come
taking
it
for
granted
that
they
are
there
and
that
is
enough
it
is
rather
delightful
to
see
a
hero
in
whom
one
had
begun
to
take
some
interest
and
whom
he
supposed
to
be
far
distant
exposed
to
dangers
abroad
and
perfidy
at
home
all
at
once
stalk
majestically
in
from
the
side
scene
and
take
his
place
before
our
eyes
it
gives
the
heart
a
great
deal
of
relief
to
see
and
know
that
he
is
there
in
person
to
stand
up
for
his
own
injured
rights
but
in
our
own
case
there
is
no
such
expedient
like
the
waggoner
we
must
return
from
the
top
of
the
hill
and
bring
up
those
of
our
characters
that
are
left
behind
at
present
we
must
return
from
the
top
of
the
great
in
aikwood
castle
into
the
housekeeper
cell
on
the
ground
floor
charlie
had
made
his
escape
almost
unobserved
those
next
to
him
weening
that
he
had
only
drawn
a
little
back
to
keep
a
due
distance
between
the
witch
and
him
so
that
they
pressed
forward
to
the
scene
without
regarding
him
the
crone
continued
her
orgies
blowing
her
fire
one
while
and
again
stirring
the
liquid
in
the
caldron
then
making
it
run
from
the
end
of
a
stick
that
she
might
note
its
state
of
gelidity
the
friar
addressed
her
in
his
usual
stile
of
sonorous
eastern
eloquence
but
she
only
regarded
him
by
a
slight
stare
and
a
motion
with
her
hand
as
if
she
wished
him
and
his
group
to
disappear
she
had
taken
them
for
spirits
that
she
had
conjured
up
and
perhaps
thought
they
were
come
before
the
time
for
in
mumbling
to
herself
they
at
one
time
heard
her
saying
so
you
are
all
there
are
you
well
i
shall
find
you
work
sotter
sotter
my
wee
pan
this
scene
went
on
for
a
considerable
time
without
any
variety
the
witch
attending
solely
to
her
caldron
and
her
fire
the
friar
standing
before
the
flame
and
tam
and
gibbie
with
their
long
kipper
noses
peeping
over
his
shoulder
the
other
three
were
behind
these
the
poet
with
his
arm
round
delany
waist
and
the
beautiful
face
of
the
boy
elias
the
very
picture
of
amazement
personified
appeared
below
the
friar
right
arm
scarcely
could
such
another
group
be
formed
for
the
painter
eye
here
sat
the
witch
haggard
and
wild
close
at
the
one
cheek
of
the
fire
watching
over
her
caldron
and
infernal
morsel
with
the
utmost
eagerness
there
stood
the
gruff
friar
with
the
keys
of
the
castle
in
his
right
hand
and
the
dim
lamp
in
his
left
raised
above
his
head
so
that
from
the
two
groups
of
light
the
marked
features
of
amazement
could
be
distinctly
traced
which
with
the
faint
and
yellowish
hue
of
their
complexions
made
the
whole
highly
picturesque
the
witch
continued
her
occupation
till
at
length
holding
up
her
stick
to
note
the
consistence
of
her
jelly
that
appeared
like
boiling
blood
and
water
mixed
there
was
something
in
its
appearance
that
confounded
her
she
dropt
both
her
tube
and
her
stirring
stick
among
the
ashes
and
turned
about
staring
wildly
at
our
group
she
appeared
as
if
examining
their
features
one
by
one
in
search
of
some
one
whose
presence
she
missed
and
perceiving
the
boy
face
below
the
friar
arm
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
that
cowering
down
at
the
same
time
like
a
cat
that
is
about
to
spring
on
its
prey
then
rising
half
up
she
moved
toward
him
in
a
stooping
posture
turning
always
her
face
first
to
the
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
until
her
nose
came
almost
in
contact
with
the
boy
on
which
he
slipped
his
face
out
of
her
sight
behind
the
friar
back
observing
next
the
two
droll
faces
over
the
friar
two
shoulders
she
appeared
delighted
with
the
view
and
letting
her
jaws
fall
down
she
smiled
at
it
but
it
was
rather
a
gape
than
a
smile
she
then
tottered
again
towards
the
fire
rocking
her
body
and
wagging
her
head
as
before
repeating
the
while
this
unmeaning
phrase
niddy
noddy
niddy
noddy
three
heads
on
ae
body
haply
she
deemed
all
the
three
faces
she
had
seen
belonged
to
the
friar
and
was
happy
at
witnessing
such
a
monstrous
appearance
sitting
down
on
her
hams
as
before
she
seized
on
her
two
implements
and
began
to
blow
and
stir
for
about
the
space
of
a
minute
testifying
great
impatience
to
see
how
her
spell
proceeded
but
the
moment
that
she
held
up
a
part
of
her
morsel
on
the
stick
and
let
it
drip
off
she
perceived
that
all
was
wrong
and
that
her
guests
were
the
reverse
of
those
she
expected
as
soon
as
she
looked
at
the
liquor
she
uttered
a
horrible
scream
while
every
joint
of
her
body
shook
with
fury
and
lifting
a
wooden
ladle
that
lay
by
her
side
with
devilish
nimbleness
she
splashed
the
boiling
liquid
on
the
faces
and
bodies
of
our
amazed
compeers
deil

auld

forehead

me

my
mither
said
gibbie
but
he
got
not
time
to
proceed
for
after
she
had
exhausted
the
contents
of
her
caldron
on
the
intruders
she
attacked
them
with
burning
coals
and
pieces
of
wood
these
she
dashed
among
them
with
such
desperate
force
that
part
of
them
sought
refuge
in
retreat
not
so
our
redoubted
friar
he
gave
the
lamp
out
of
his
hand
to
the
laird
bidding
him
take
care
of
it
and
turning
his
back
toward
her
and
running
backward
for
fear
of
farther
injury
to
his
face
and
eyes
he
seized
the
witch
by
the
frock
and
putting
his
arm
round
both
hers
to
restrain
them
he
held
her
fast
to
his
side
in
doing
so
he
uncovered
the
cross
that
hung
at
his
girdle
when
she
saw
this
and
that
her
body
was
pressed
against
it
she
uttered
the
most
horrified
howlings
and
appeared
to
be
falling
into
convulsions
nevertheless
the
friar
kept
his
hold
he
let
her
scream
on
and
dragging
her
toward
the
door
said
unto
her
thou
wicked
one
as
thy
works
have
been
so
shall
be
thy
reward
and
as
thou
hast
sown
so
also
shalt
thou
reap
come
with
me
and
i
will
put
thee
into
a
place
where
thou
shalt
cease
from
troubling
without
more
ado
he
bore
her
away
to
the
vault
where
lay
her
surly
and
unyielding
associate
beside
his
mass
of
dry
human
bones
and
forcing
her
in
he
locked
them
up
together
saying
as
he
turned
the
massy
bolt
lo
the
gates
of
iron
and
of
brass
close
upon
thee
the
bolts
of
steel
are
drawn
around
thy
dwelling
there
shalt
thou
remain
and
there
shall
thy
flesh
be
consumed
unless
thou
repentest
thee
of
the
evil
that
thou
hast
done
there
was
a
shrewd
smile
on
the
friar
face
as
he
said
this
as
of
one
who
either
did
not
mean
to
put
his
threat
in
execution
or
marvelled
how
it
was
that
he
should
thus
be
lording
it
in
the
castle
of
aikwood
and
imprisoning
whom
he
would
never
till
that
instant
did
any
of
the
party
miss
their
friend
and
champion
charlie
scott
but
when
they
turned
from
the
door
of
the
prison
to
consult
what
was
to
be
done
next
behold
he
was
wanting
this
caused
them
great
dismay
but
the
friar
most
of
all
wo
is
me
cried
he
how
is
the
mighty
departed
and
the
pillar
of
our
strength
moved
out
of
its
place
as
well
may
they
take
my
head
from
my
body
and
say
unto
me
live
as
bid
us
go
on
and
prosper
without
that
mighty
man
the
poor
waggoner
must
again
return
from
the
top
of
the
hill
and
bring
up
the
most
important
and
weighty
part
of
his
cargo
no
less
a
load
than
muckle
charlie
scott
laird
of
yardbire
and
the
far
famed
warlock
and
necromancer
master
michael
scott
the
mighty
uproar
that
charlie
made
at
the
head
of
the
stair
when
he
believed
the
devil
to
be
on
the
steps
aroused
the
great
necromancer
from
his
nocturnal
experiments
all
of
which
were
of
an
infernal
kind
at
such
hours
as
these
his
capacious
mind
was
abstracted
from
all
worldly
concerns
such
as
other
mortals
busy
themselves
about
if
any
thing
sublunary
engaged
his
studies
and
calculations
it
was
how
to
make
the
living
die
and
the
dead
to
live
how
to
remove
mountains
out
of
their
places
to
turn
the
sea
into
dry
land
and
the
fields
into
a
billowy
and
briny
ocean
or
in
any
way
counteract
nature
in
her
goings
on
in
some
of
these
great
enterprises
was
he
doubtlessly
engaged
that
morning
when
the
voice
of
charlie
scott
astounded
his
ears
often
had
hosts
of
demons
mustered
at
his
call
in
the
castle
of
aikwood
and
the
yelling
sounds
of
the
infernals
were
no
strangers
to
his
ears
but
never
had
he
heard
such
a
potent
voice
before
as
that
sent
forth
by
charlie
when
he
conceived
himself
cooped
up
between
the
devil
and
a
bolted
door
conceived
did
i
say
no
charlie
saw
distinctly
by
this
time
an
indefinable
being
coming
slowly
up
to
him
saint
peter
as
he
did
thresh
the
warlock
door
is
there
any
body
here
hilloa
open
the
door
i
say
thump
thump
thump
the
bolt
inside
was
drawn
and
owing
to
the
strong
pressure
without
the
door
flew
wide
open
at
once
charlie
perceiving
the
light
and
fearless
of
ought
but
the
figure
behind
him
rushed
into
the
room
and
made
toward
the
fire
the
door
was
instantly
shut
behind
him
with
a
loud
and
furious
clash
and
charlie
then
turning
around
got
the
first
look
of
the
inmate
he
was
a
boardly
muscular
man
somewhat
emaciated
in
his
appearance
with
a
strong
bushy
beard
that
flowed
to
his
girdle
of
a
hue
that
had
once
been
jet
black
but
was
now
slightly
tinted
with
grey
his
eyes
were
uncommonly
bright
and
piercing
but
they
had
some
resemblance
to
the
eyes
of
a
serpent
he
wore
on
his
head
a
turban
of
crimson
velvet
ornamented
with
mystic
figures
in
gold
and
on
the
front
of
it
was
a
star
of
many
dazzling
colours
the
rest
of
his
body
was
wrapped
in
a
mantle
or
gown
striped
with
all
the
hues
of
the
rainbow
and
many
more
charlie
eye
had
lately
been
lighted
up
with
terror
but
as
it
fell
on
the
majestic
figure
of
master
michael
scott
its
wild
gleam
softened
into
respect
and
he
saluted
him
with
his
quick
abrupt
border
bow
which
rather
resembled
the
motion
made
by
a
raven
beckoning
from
his
rock
as
he
wakes
the
surrounding
echoes
than
the
slow
and
graceful
courtesy
then
so
well
understood
among
the
great
michael
still
kept
his
erect
posture
at
the
back
of
the
door
fixing
on
our
yeoman
an
indignant
and
angry
glance
that
look
conjured
up
a
little
more
of
breeding
he
doffed
his
steel
bonnet
with
the
one
hand
stroked
down
the
hair
of
his
forehead
with
the
other
and
gave
the
master
another
bow
or
rather
a
nod
gude
sir
i
fancy
you
the
lord
o
this
castle
said
charlie
you
fancy
so
do
you
said
the
master
with
a
sneer
and
giving
three
tramps
with
his
heel
on
the
floor
in
one
moment
the
three
pages
prig
prim
and
pricker
stood
beside
him
work
master
work
what
work
now
take
that
burly
thief
and
housebreaker
bind
him
and
put
him
to
the
test
stop
short
there
my
good
masters
till
i
speak
said
charlie
i
neither
a
housebreaker
nor
a
thief
but
a
leel
man
our
kinsman
and
your
ain
master
michael
scott
i
came
here
on
fair
and
honourable
service
and
i
have
been
guidit
waur
than
a
tike
and
just
tell
you
plainly
for
i
rather
an
chap
that
if
ane
thae
brats
dare
but
to
touch
me
i
tak
my
hand
aff
his
haffet
in
sic
a
way
that
he
sanna
grene
to
lay
foul
finger
on
a
gentleman
again
the
three
pages
fell
a
giggling
at
this
speech
and
one
of
them
brushed
forward
and
seized
charlie
with
a
force
of
which
he
had
no
conception
but
he
was
one
that
never
suffered
any
personal
attack
with
impunity
he
drew
a
stroke
with
his
clenched
fist
and
aimed
such
a
blow
at
the
page
head
that
if
he
had
had
a
head
like
other
pages
would
have
smashed
it
to
pieces
charlie
hit
no
head
at
all
he
struck
a
thing
of
nought
but
the
force
of
his
arm
was
such
that
about
two
yards
farther
on
he
hit
an
apparatus
of
curious
construction
which
he
called
a
machine
for
setting
the
wind
on
fire
and
which
he
made
to
fly
all
in
flinders
against
the
wall
the
master
eye
kindled
with
rage
but
the
three
urchins
who
delighted
in
nothing
but
mischief
laughed
still
the
louder
and
pressed
all
forward
on
charlie
he
had
been
a
little
astounded
at
missing
the
page
head
but
being
somewhat
flustered
he
had
not
leisure
to
reflect
and
his
conceptions
were
naturally
none
of
the
most
acute
so
for
the
present
he
took
it
for
a
miss
but
seeing
they
purposed
to
lay
violent
hands
on
him
he
sprung
back
into
the
middle
of
the
room
in
order
to
command
weapon
space
and
drawing
out
the
eskdale
souple
he
stood
on
the
defensive
in
a
most
determined
posture
the
pertinacious
elves
wheeled
also
backward
taking
a
circle
round
behind
the
master
and
advanced
on
him
all
abreast
good
lord
with
what
might
charlie
struck
at
them
he
came
on
them
with
a
hew
that
he
meant
should
cut
them
all
three
through
the
middle
at
once
but
he
a
second
time
struck
on
vacancy
the
sword
whistled
through
the
void
taking
charlie
round
with
it
and
demolishing
almost
every
thing
that
was
in
the
room
the
pages
screamed
with
delight
but
michael
foamed
with
fury
charlie
paid
no
regard
either
to
him
or
the
devastation
he
had
made
among
his
utensils
but
springing
round
the
board
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
said
in
a
loud
perturbed
voice
tell
me
just
this
ae
thing
michael
are
thae
three
creatures
deils
because
an
they
be
deils
i
hae
nae
mair
chance
wi
them
than
a
cat
but
as
for
yoursel
goodman
i
ken
ye
are
flesh
and
blood
and
o
my
ain
kith
and
kin
and
with
that
he
seized
michael
by
the
throat
therefore
either
gar
thae
hellicats
gang
about
their
business
or
by
him
that
made
us
i
thraw
your
neck
about
whether
it
was
the
might
of
the
enchanter
himself
or
that
of
his
bond
spirits
charlie
wist
not
but
in
one
moment
after
that
his
feet
were
tripped
from
beneath
him
and
he
was
laid
on
his
back
on
the
floor
there
he
was
held
by
a
might
against
which
his
great
strength
could
not
prevail
bound
with
cords
and
stretched
on
the
board
the
master
and
his
familiars
then
conversed
in
latin
a
language
of
which
charlie
knew
but
little
having
never
been
at
court
but
he
heard
they
were
conversing
about
his
baptism
charlie
had
not
got
much
time
in
his
life
to
think
about
these
sacred
rites
yet
he
had
always
held
them
in
proper
respect
and
veneration
and
at
that
time
he
blessed
the
hour
he
had
been
presented
in
holy
church
having
strong
hopes
that
on
that
account
the
powers
of
hell
would
not
prevail
against
him
the
elves
loosed
his
and
unclasped
his
laying
his
manly
bosom
quite
bare
the
master
gave
them
directions
in
latin
and
each
of
them
went
and
brought
a
long
knife
with
two
edges
sharp
as
a
razor
and
having
a
point
like
a
lance
i
didna
trow
that
there
had
been
ought
sae
misleared
in
nature
as
this
said
charlie
it
no
that
i
ony
feared
for
death
i
hae
looked
him
ower
often
i
the
face
to
blench
at
his
ca
but
i
wad
just
hae
liket
to
hae
i
the
field
wi
my
sword
i
my
hand
and
no
to
be
cut
up
like
a
christmas
pye
and
carved
a
into
collops
by
a
wheen
damned
deils
one
of
them
prepared
to
cut
open
his
breast
and
another
his
belly
but
a
moment
dispute
taking
place
between
them
in
some
unknown
tongue
about
the
mode
as
charlie
believed
he
crossed
himself
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
bound
hands
and
pronounced
a
sacred
name
into
himself
that
instant
he
perceived
the
pages
fall
and
stand
back
their
faces
blenched
with
dread
and
the
weapons
fell
from
their
hands
the
master
was
wroth
and
ordered
them
to
proceed
as
charlie
weened
by
his
motions
but
instead
of
that
they
retired
trembling
into
a
corner
he
snatched
a
knife
from
one
of
them
as
if
determined
to
do
the
deed
himself
charlie
then
deemed
himself
gone
for
he
had
a
sort
of
confused
idea
that
by
certain
laws
of
nature
and
the
use
of
holy
rites
wicked
spirits
were
restrained
else
mankind
would
be
destroyed
but
what
law
of
nature
or
what
holy
word
or
sign
thought
he
can
restrain
the
arm
of
a
wicked
man
it
is
my
duty
to
try
however
thought
he
again
and
with
that
he
whispered
a
prayer
to
the
son
of
the
virgin
that
he
would
save
a
warrior
from
a
death
like
this
charlie
prayer
was
heard
short
as
it
was
for
at
that
very
moment
while
yet
the
syllables
hung
on
his
lips
entered
the
gruff
figure
of
the
friar
with
the
keys
of
the
castle
over
his
arm
and
followed
by
his
associates
what
seek
you
here
you
dogs
cried
the
master
turning
about
with
the
great
knife
in
his
hand
am
i
thus
to
have
my
privacy
disturbed
and
my
abode
ravaged
by
a
pack
of
carrion
hounds
from
the
hills
brave
pages
mine
bind
them
all
and
cut
me
them
into
a
thousand
pieces
scarcely
was
the
order
given
ere
they
had
the
poet
on
the
floor
and
bound
with
strong
cords
the
rest
prepared
to
escape
but
the
great
enchanter
placed
his
back
to
the
door
brandished
his
great
knife
and
dared
them
to
approach
him
the
mettledness
of
these
pages
can
not
be
conceived
far
less
described
they
seemed
but
to
will
a
thing
and
it
was
done
ere
ever
one
of
the
intruders
had
time
to
rally
his
thoughts
or
almost
to
think
at
all
three
of
them
and
the
boy
were
all
lying
bound
in
fetters
but
when
the
imps
came
to
seize
on
the
friar
they
could
not
they
skipped
about
and
about
him
but
they
had
not
power
even
to
touch
his
frock
the
virgin
stood
behind
him
trembling
and
on
their
feeling
their
want
of
power
over
the
friar
they
turned
to
lay
hold
on
her
but
the
moment
they
touched
her
robe
they
retired
back
in
dismay
michael
looked
as
if
he
dreaded
there
was
something
about
these
two
that
boded
him
no
good
but
he
wist
not
what
it
was
for
he
had
never
seen
the
prowess
of
his
bond
spirits
counteracted
before
therefore
he
awaited
the
event
for
a
space
when
he
perceived
them
vanquished
the
friar
had
time
to
rally
his
thoughts
and
remembered
that
the
maid
had
the
blessed
gospel
concealed
in
her
bosom
and
judging
that
these
were
perhaps
fiends
with
whom
they
had
to
do
who
durst
not
stand
against
the
word
of
truth
he
drew
his
cross
from
below
his
frock
that
cross
which
had
been
consecrated
at
the
shrine
of
saint
peter
bathed
in
holy
water
and
blessed
with
many
blessings
from
the
mouths
of
ancient
martyrs
had
done
wonderous
miracles
in
the
hands
of
saints
of
former
days
and
lifting
that
reverendly
up
on
high
he
pronounced
the
words
from
holy
writ
against
which
no
demon
or
false
spirit
power
could
prevail
in
one
moment
all
the
three
imps
fled
yelling
from
the
apartment
the
countenance
of
the
enchanter
fell
and
he
quaked
where
he
stood
but
the
eye
of
the
friar
was
kindled
up
with
exultation
and
joy
there
worketh
the
hand
of
my
master
exclaimed
he
there
have
i
trusted
and
i
am
not
like
thee
ashamed
of
my
trust
i
have
a
of
hope
and
it
is
founded
on
a
rock
but
thy
habitation
trembleth
beneath
thee
and
dost
thou
know
or
hast
thou
considered
what
is
underneath
the
friar
then
went
up
and
loosed
the
bonds
of
his
friend
charlie
and
of
all
the
rest
one
by
one
exulting
in
his
creed
and
pouring
forth
such
sentences
of
sublime
adoration
as
are
not
suited
for
an
idle
tale
the
master
at
length
took
courage
and
rebuked
him
saying
it
is
vain
for
thee
foolish
dupe
of
a
foolish
creed
to
multiply
such
great
swelling
words
of
vanity
what
though
thy
might
hath
for
once
prevailed
above
my
might
and
thy
spell
proved
more
powerful
than
mine
i
will
engage
nevertheless
that
in
nine
times
out
of
ten
mine
on
fair
trial
shall
prevail
over
thine
and
at
all
events
i
can
at
this
time
call
in
the
arm
of
flesh
to
my
assistance
and
do
with
you
whatever
seemeth
to
me
good
ay
gude
faith
and
that
very
true
master
michael
scott
said
charlie
and
that
we
saw
wi
our
ain
een
it
is
great
nonsense
to
quarrel
with
the
lord
of
a
castle
aneath
his
ain
roof
although
i
confess
i
was
the
first
to
do
it
mysel
but
there
an
auld
saying
wha
wad
sit
i
rome
and
strive
wi
the
pope
or
misca
a
macdonald
in
the
raws
o
lochaber
we
came
wi
nae
sic
intent
but
in
fair
friendship
and
on
courteous
errand
and
now
when
we
are
a
rather
on
equal
footing
again
let
me
beg
o
you
great
and
powerful
master
to
be
a
reasonable
man
for
aince
answer
the
warden
request
and
let
us
gae
for
really
great
sir
our
master
canna
well
want
us
and
mair
nor
that
i
feared
yon
chaps
at
the
mill
dinna
gie
corby
ony
water
though
the
master
did
not
understand
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
yet
the
honest
simplicity
of
charlie
somewhat
interested
him
his
stern
and
sullen
brow
cleared
to
something
like
a
smile
and
on
looking
at
the
singular
and
original
group
before
him
he
half
resolved
within
himself
to
have
some
intercourse
with
humanity
once
more
if
it
were
but
for
a
day
or
even
an
hour
thought
he
would
it
not
form
some
variety
in
a
life
thus
dedicated
to
searching
after
hidden
mysteries
a
life
of
turmoil
and
distraction
in
which
there
is
no
allay
such
were
some
of
the
thoughts
that
glanced
on
the
dark
mind
of
the
necromancer
as
he
turned
his
eye
on
the
broad
face
of
honest
yardbire
and
what
may
your
master
request
be
yeoman
said
he
charlie
had
great
hopes
that
he
would
now
bring
matters
to
a
bearing
at
once
and
coming
a
step
nearer
to
the
master
he
laid
the
one
across
the
other
and
answered
him
thus
why
gude
faith
sir
it
is
neither
mair
nor
less
than
just
this
ye
ken
the
last
time
ye
war
at
the
castle
of
mountcomyn
ye
gae
our
master
your
kinsman
the
warden
some
little
insight
anent
things
that
were
to
come
about
of
some
bits
o
glebes
and
hopes
and
glens
ye
ken
that
war
to
fa
to
his
house
now
sir
knight
or
master
as
i
should
say
he
a
man
that
aboon
a
ithers
that
ever
war
born
looks
to
the
honour
and
the
advantage
o
his
house
he
as
loyal
as
the
day
light
as
generous
as
a
corn
mill
and
as
brave
as
a
blast
o
snaw
or
a
floody
river
od
you
will
turn
either
the
ane
or
the
ither
sooner
than
you
will
turn
him
his
muirland
callans
at
his
ay
i
hae
seen
but
needless
to
tell
what
he
do
for
his
ain
so
you
see
sir
master
that
was
the
preceese
thing
he
sent
us
for
to
send
troops
to
his
assistance
i
perceive
said
the
master
why
sir
master
to
say
the
truth
we
hadna
that
in
charge
though
it
wad
be
far
mair
mack
like
and
far
mair
feasible
and
far
mair
honourable
into
the
bargain
to
send
yon
great
clan
o
chaps
to
help
our
master
than
to
hae
them
lying
idle
eating
you
out
house
and
hauld
here
ye
wad
aye
be
getting
part
o
the
spulzie
half
a
dozen
o
kye
at
a
time
now
and
then
disna
do
amiss
sae
if
you
will
come
to
terms
i
will
engage
for
ane
to
see
you
get
fair
share
to
the
hoof
and
the
horn
the
barn
an
the
beef
boat
the
barrel
and
the
bed
blanket
but
ye
ken
sir
in
matters
like
this
we
maun
do
ae
thing
afore
another
like
business
men
and
ye
maun
be
sae
good
and
sae
kind
and
sae
obliging
as
to
answer
our
first
request
first
as
far
as
i
can
recollect
said
michael
i
never
heard
any
request
made
why
gude
faith
sir
ye
ken
i
believe
i
forgot
that
part
said
charlie
but
ye
see
that
neither
here
nor
there
for
the
thing
requires
some
explanation
do
you
ken
a
this
mad
story
about
the
siege
o
roxburgh
i
trouble
myself
about
no
worldly
things
said
the
master
nor
do
i
wish
to
hear
about
them
is
there
no
one
present
who
can
tell
me
this
great
business
at
one
breath
charlie
stepped
back
there
nae
garring
him
hae
patience
and
good
troth
my
tongue
i
fear
has
outrun
my
logic
said
he
friar
speak
you
great
and
magnificent
master
of
arts
said
the
friar
stepping
forward
whom
i
have
longed
to
see
above
all
men
lo
thou
seest
and
thou
hearest
that
this
man
although
he
be
a
man
of
might
and
a
warrior
from
his
youth
is
yet
uncouth
of
speech
and
altogether
diffuse
therefore
listen
thou
diligently
unto
the
voice
of
thy
servant
behold
we
are
come
to
thee
from
the
man
that
ruleth
over
the
borders
of
the
land
and
leadeth
forth
his
troops
to
battle
he
sendeth
unto
thee
greeting
and
beseecheth
to
know
of
thee
what
shall
befal
unto
his
people
and
to
his
house
in
the
latter
days
it
is
thy
counsel
alone
that
he
asketh
for
thou
art
renowned
for
wisdom
and
foresight
to
the
farthest
corners
of
the
earth
the
two
nations
are
engaged
in
great
and
bloody
contest
and
high
are
the
stakes
for
which
they
play
the
man
who
sent
us
intreateth
of
thee
to
disclose
unto
thy
servants
who
shall
finally
prevail
and
whether
it
behoveth
him
to
join
himself
to
the
captain
of
his
people
he
hath
moreover
sent
unto
thee
by
our
hand
these
two
beautiful
captives
the
one
to
be
thine
handmaiden
and
the
other
to
be
thy
servant
and
run
at
thy
bidding
and
whatsoever
thou
requirest
of
our
captain
that
will
he
do
even
to
the
half
of
all
that
he
hath
there
was
but
one
thing
on
earth
by
which
the
wizard
could
be
flattered
and
that
was
a
deference
to
his
profound
art
he
therefore
listened
with
patience
to
the
friar
and
answered
that
the
request
his
kinsman
had
made
would
take
many
days
to
consider
of
for
said
he
i
have
those
to
deal
with
that
are
more
capricious
than
the
changing
seasons
and
more
perverse
than
opposing
tides
and
winds
therefore
remain
with
me
a
few
days
that
i
may
prove
you
od
bless
ye
sir
master
the
thing
is
impossible
said
charlie
i
coudna
bide
frae
my
captain
and
chief
and
him
in
jeopardy
neither
could
i
endure
to
think
that
my
poor
beast
should
want
water
sae
lang
a
man
life
often
depends
on
his
beast
thou
givest
us
no
meat
said
the
friar
nor
wine
nor
strong
drink
givest
thou
unto
us
how
therefore
can
we
remain
in
thine
house
nevertheless
would
i
love
to
abide
a
short
time
with
thee
to
witness
thy
great
might
before
which
the
masters
of
divinations
in
other
lands
have
trembled
verily
i
would
also
show
unto
thee
what
thy
servant
can
do
if
i
were
to
cope
with
such
as
thee
it
would
only
be
to
show
thee
thy
littleness
said
michael
but
thy
creed
is
an
abomination
to
me
and
i
abhor
it
in
the
meantime
call
up
my
steward
and
i
will
order
him
to
provide
you
with
meat
and
drink
the
poet
now
for
the
first
time
spoke
up
in
the
master
hearing
and
indignant
at
the
steward
design
on
delany
he
delivered
himself
with
great
vehemence
nay
say
not
so
great
master
the
devil
hath
possession
of
that
man
sure
as
the
stars
burn
on
the
morning
brow
he
give
us
meat
or
drink
sooner
he
will
draw
forth
the
crimson
current
from
our
veins
and
lay
us
with
the
dead
sooner
he
will
rob
beauty
of
her
treasure
and
deface
the
image
of
his
maker
let
us
go
forth
to
hill
or
dale
or
wood
strive
with
the
crow
for
carrion
or
contend
with
owlets
for
a
mouse
but
to
be
bearded
by
that
same
surly
beast
the
heart
of
man
not
brooks
it
as
for
me
i
lift
my
voice
my
absolute
protest
against
the
degradation
and
effect
he
is
indeed
a
son
of
belial
said
the
friar
but
i
have
put
him
in
ward
that
he
trouble
us
not
lo
here
be
the
keys
of
thy
castle
which
i
intend
to
keep
as
our
surety
therefore
show
me
the
place
where
thy
good
things
are
disposed
and
i
myself
will
be
steward
for
a
time
for
indeed
that
man
of
thine
is
such
a
son
of
belial
that
a
man
can
not
speak
to
him
the
master
brow
lowered
with
dissatisfaction
his
subordinate
spirits
in
whom
he
trusted
had
no
power
over
the
friar
and
other
man
had
he
none
within
the
castle
save
gourlay
who
was
almost
as
much
fiend
as
man
he
therefore
intreated
the
friar
to
set
his
steward
at
liberty
and
restore
to
him
the
keys
else
no
meat
or
drink
could
be
had
and
at
the
same
time
he
gave
them
all
warrandice
that
they
should
be
kindly
used
my
seneschal
said
he
is
as
stubborn
and
froward
as
any
demon
of
the
pit
nor
will
he
do
one
kind
or
fair
action
save
by
compulsion
but
he
dares
not
disobey
me
if
he
should
presume
to
dispute
my
orders
in
the
slightest
instance
one
word
from
you
shall
be
sufficient
and
i
will
shew
you
how
he
shall
be
requited
it
was
forthwith
agreed
that
the
master
should
accompany
them
down
to
the
dungeon
in
order
to
restrain
the
fury
and
violence
of
his
servant
matters
were
therefore
arranged
and
the
two
prisoners
set
at
liberty
the
steward
was
sullen
and
intractable
lying
still
on
the
dungeon
floor
disregardful
of
the
words
spoken
to
him
by
the
friar
but
when
he
heard
the
master
threatening
accents
he
sprung
to
his
feet
and
came
forth
looking
at
charlie
in
such
a
manner
as
plainly
said
i
shall
be
revenged
on
you
the
master
then
took
him
to
task
demanding
by
whose
orders
he
had
shut
up
his
kinsman
friends
in
the
vault
but
he
only
snarled
and
gnashed
his
teeth
in
reply
and
then
to
suffer
yourself
to
be
mured
up
there
said
the
master
ay
said
gourlay
some
have
won
a
tilt
on
the
king
of
the
field
who
never
saw
the
day
to
win
it
on
another
for
the
viper
blood
that
venoms
thy
heart
do
thou
ought
amiss
to
these
gentlemen
said
the
master
or
to
this
obnoxious
thing
that
is
their
ward
wherefore
let
me
ask
were
they
compelled
to
shut
you
up
there
the
steward
only
grunted
in
reply
but
the
poet
came
again
boldly
forward
having
been
exasperated
beyond
measure
at
the
steward
for
his
attempt
on
delany
and
he
said
sir
knight
in
that
i
truly
counsel
you
at
dead
hour
of
night
when
all
was
still
save
the
snell
piping
of
the
frosty
wind
even
we
were
all
at
peace
and
quiet
lay
as
did
the
dead
man
bones
but
that
between
the
friar
at
equal
intervals
sent
forth
his
nasal
roar
so
vehement
that
the
mice
yea
and
the
starveling
rats
ceased
from
their
prowling
listened
the
dire
sound
from
fleshy
trumpet
of
our
mother
church
then
sought
with
stretched
forth
tail
and
nimble
foot
the
depth
profound
there
quaking
did
they
lie
like
fiends
driven
from
the
height
to
the
abyss
lank
make
chilled
heart
and
grievous
length
of
tail
at
that
ill
hour
in
comes
this
boding
owl
this
man
of
sin
and
straight
demands
that
peerless
maiden
for
your
honour
couch
him
we
refused
the
maiden
shrieked
for
help
he
dragged
her
forth
and
on
this
laurelled
head
crowned
by
the
muses
with
celestial
bays
inflicted
ruthless
wound
the
bedesman
also
fell
but
he
our
friend
the
hector
of
the
hills
wrought
his
and
him
thus
my
say
is
ended
the
master
as
the
poet
spoke
seemed
several
times
so
much
amused
that
they
expected
he
would
have
burst
into
laughter
but
one
look
of
his
eye
spoke
sentences
when
he
heard
that
gourlay
had
demanded
the
maid
for
him
he
gave
him
such
a
glance
as
made
the
wretch
almost
cower
to
the
earth
and
when
the
poet
ended
he
turned
his
eyes
on
charlie
measuring
him
from
head
to
foot
and
seeming
as
if
he
doubted
the
fact
that
he
or
any
man
could
master
his
redoubted
seneschal
however
the
master
had
seen
so
much
of
the
group
that
he
determined
contrary
to
his
custom
to
have
some
amusement
with
them
he
therefore
ordered
his
seneschal
forthwith
to
provide
all
good
things
for
their
entertainment
the
stubborn
wight
made
no
movement
betokening
obedience
he
stood
upright
with
his
dull
white
face
a
little
elevated
and
his
eyes
turned
up
below
his
brows
while
those
who
were
next
him
heard
him
saying
to
himself
in
accents
that
creaked
in
his
throat
hell
must
be
moved
for
this
repast
the
master
heard
not
this
sentence
but
noting
his
steward
indecision
he
stamped
with
his
foot
and
pointing
with
his
finger
the
latter
led
the
way
into
an
antichamber
of
the
same
cold
and
naked
appearance
with
the
rest
of
the
apartments
of
the
castle
where
leaving
them
with
a
light
the
two
went
away
into
the
great
dormitory
to
cast
their
cantrips
and
bring
up

the
morning
had
by
this
time
dawned
on
the
gray
hills
of
the
forest
and
that
with
an
aspect
gloomy
and
foreboding
the
white
snowy
clouds
had
crept
down
into
the
bosoms
of
the
hills
and
above
these
clouds
were
here
and
there
to
be
seen
the
top
of
a
mountain
crested
with
its
dark
cairn
so
that
the
heavens
and
the
earth
seemed
to
be
mingled
together

cried
charlie
as
he
peeped
out
at
his
small
crannied
window
but

not
thou
afraid
my
son
of
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
for
there
is
one
that
is
greater
than
he
said
the
friar
and
though
the
fiends
may
for
a
while
muster
their
fogs
and
foment
the
air
with
storms
yet
will
he
send
forth
his
angels
and
scatter
them
yea
he
will
send
them
forth
riding
on
the
whirlwind
and
the
clouds
of
heaven
shall
be
their
chariots
and
the
powers
of
darkness
shall
fly
in
dismay
before
them
the
friar
stepped
forward
to
the
window
and
gazed
for
a
minute
in
breathless
astonishment
then
turning
away
he
added
in
a
solemn
tone
verily
my
children
i
am
afraid
to
look
at
the
face
of
the
sky
or
to
behold
the
hues
that
are
abroad
on
the
firmament
this
day
though
my
strength
be
the
munition
of
rocks
the
steward
now
appeared
with
his
rod
of
office
in
his
hand
and
with
all
due
ceremony
marshalled
his
guests
up
the
great
stair
and
finally
up
a
small
winding
stair
to
an
apartment
at
the
very
top
of
the
upmost
tower
above
all
the
turrets
and
paved
battlements
this
room
was
in
a
blaze
of
light
with
flaming
torches
all
around
and
joyful
sight
to
our
precious
embassy
the
table
was
covered
with
rich
viands
in
great
abundance
the
friar
having
got
short
of
breath
in
his
ascent
lagged
considerably
behind
while
the
foremost
rushing
in
every
one
began
to
help
himself
with
the
greatest
avidity
so
that
when
the
friar
at
length
came
puffing
into
the
apartment
all
the
rest
had
begun
without
grace
the
seat
at
the
foot
of
the
table
was
still
unoccupied
and
before
that
there
stood
a
beautiful
smoking
sirloin
of
beef
with
a
gentle
brown
crust
around
it
and
half
swimming
in
gravy
never
was
there
a
more
delicious
sight
presented
to
a
hungry
man
the
worthy
friar
seeing
all
the
rest
engaged
would
not
risk
a
trespass
on
good
manners
by
interrupting
them
although
it
was
an
established
custom
with
him
to
bless
every
meal
before
tasting
it
in
conformity
with
this
venerable
custom
among
christians
he
lifted
up
his
spread
hands
closed
his
eyes
and
leaning
forward
above
the
beef
so
closely
that
he
actually
breathed
upon
it
and
felt
the
flavour
of
health
and
joy
ascending
by
his
nostrils
in
that
fervent
and
respectful
attitude
he
blessed
the
beef
in
the
name
of
jesus
never
had
blessing
a
more
dolorous
effect
when
the
friar
opened
his
eyes
the
beef
was
gone
there
was
nothing
left
on
the
great
wooden
plate
before
him
but
a
small
insignificant
thing
resembling
the
joint
of
a
frog
leg
or
that
of
a
rat
and
perhaps
two
or
three
drops
of
gravy
the
friar
associates
were
all
busily
engaged
the
steward
was
moving
about
behind
them
and
at
that
time
happened
to
be
passing
by
near
where
the
friar
sat
of
course
this
latter
worthy
had
no
doubt
whatever
but
that
the
malicious
old
rascal
had
stolen
the
roast
slyly
from
under
his
nose
the
moment
that
his
eyes
were
closed
whereas
the
steward
was
as
much
astounded
as
he
it
was
a
fine
picture
the
friar
had
placed
himself
hastily
to
begin
but
missing
his
beef
and
seeing
nothing
of
it
on
the
board
he
was
moved
with
great
anger
and
indignation
there
he
sat
biting
his
lip
and
having
his
deep
dark
eye
fixed
on
the
seneschal
and
there
stood
the
tall
seneschal
with
his
mouth
wide
open
his
face
half
raised
toward
the
cornice
of
the
chamber
and
his
dull
heavy
eye
fixed
on
the
friar
plate
he
was
in
utter
dismay
for
he
dreaded
that
on
such
a
blessing
being
pronounced
openly
the
whole
of
his
provisions
would
in
like
manner
vanish
away
and
he
was
a
blithe
man
when
instead
of
blessing
the
friar
on
opening
his
mouth
was
rather
inclined
to
curse
cursed
be
thy
malice
for
it
is
great
cried
he
thou
nabal
thou
rabshakeh
thou
shimei
the
son
of
bichri
thou
er
thou
onan
thou
vile
judas
the
son
of
simon
magormissabub
be
thy
name
and
may
it
be
blotted
out
after
thee
and
become
a
and
a
proverb
and
a
hissing
among
people
and
children
restore
that
which
thou
hast
unjustly
taken
away
before
i
thrust
my
sword
into
thee
and
take
away
thy
life
give
unto
me
the
precious
morsel
thou
hast
taken
away
or
lo
thou
art
in
the
jaws
of
destruction
and
the
pit
openeth
her
mouth
wide
upon
thee
the
steward
answered
neither
good
nor
bad
for
he
was
afraid
of
the
vengeance
of
his
master
and
the
evil
spirits
that
wrought
at
his
bidding
and
delighted
in
nothing
so
much
as
in
tormenting
him
else
had
he
not
taken
the
friar
curses
without
repaying
them
sevenfold
he
therefore
shut
his
mouth
and
closed
his
eyes
putting
on
a
countenance
of
the
utmost
derision
but
the
friar
heart
had
been
set
upon
the
beef
his
soul
had
rejoiced
over
it
and
he
could
not
with
patience
give
way
to
the
idea
of
losing
it
therefore
instead
of
joining
the
rest
who
were
devouring
their
various
fare
with
great
eagerness
he
continued
his
anathemas
on
the
steward
blethering
gouk
cried
charlie
can
nae
ye
tak
part
o
what
gaun
and
haud
your
jaw
what
signify
a
thae
strings
o
gospel
phrases
at
sic
a
time
as
this
will
they
fill
a
hungry
stamock
or
mak
the
worthy
seneschal
either
better
or
waur
than
he
is
come
pledge
me
in
a
cup
wine
to
the
health
of
our
great
landlord
master
michael
scott
they
handed
the
stoup
down
to
the
friar
who
filled
for
himself
and
took
the
pledge
though
still
with
a
gloomy
and
a
discontented
brow
he
then
left
his
seat
and
went
up
one
side
of
the
board
close
to
gibbie
jordan
where
he
began
himself
to
a
slice
from
a
mangled
shoulder
of
venison
apparently
but
it
relished
not
for
still
the
lost
beef
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
and
his
eye
glanced
hot
displeasure
at
the
steward
surely
he
is
of
all
men
the
most
accursed
added
he
he
drinketh
up
malice
as
the
ox
drinketh
up
water
and
as
his
name
is
so
is
he
whereunto
he
hath
conveyed
the
morsel
that
i
loved
is
a
matter
too
high
for
me
to
comprehend
i
see
it
not
in
any
corner
of
the
habitation
nor
doth
the
smell
of
it
reach
my
nostrils
but
i
will
visit
it
upon
his
head
and
mine
eyes
shall
see
my
desire
on
him
the
dishes
of
meat
were
however
of
good
quality
and
well
mixed
with
fat
and
lean
yet
none
of
them
knew
exactly
what
they
were
neither
would
the
sullen
steward
deign
to
give
them
the
least
information
on
that
head
there
was
even
one
large
shapeless
piece
of
a
savour
and
consistence
so
peculiar
that
no
one
of
them
could
tell
whether
it
was
flesh
or
fish
still
they
continued
their
perseverance
devouring
one
dish
after
another
and
drinking
off
one
stoup
of
wine
after
another
without
any
abatement
of
appetite
on
the
one
side
or
any
exhiliration
of
spirits
on
the
other
the
steward
always
bringing
in
a
supply
with
the
most
perfect
equanimity
at
length
our
yeomen
began
to
look
at
one
another
their
hands
had
waxed
weary
with
cutting
and
their
jaws
would
scarcely
any
more
perform
their
office
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
my
brethren
said
the
friar
surely
it
is
better
for
us
to
desist
lest
our
table
prove
a
snare
unto
us
lo
my
hands
are
weary
and
my
are
pained
even
to
their
utmost
extremities
verily
it
is
all
vanity
for
my
body
is
only
filled
as
with
the
east
wind
na
na
ply
away
it
good
sport
i
dinna
see
how
we
can
be
better
employed
said
the
deil
tam
i
think
my
brethren
that
we
should
from
eating
straight
refrain
said
the
poet
for
eating
is
but
weariness
and
drinking
is
but
pain
there
is
no
strength
into
our
bread
nor
spirit
in
our
wine
some
warlock
wight
has
the
might
out
of
this
food
of
mine
the
steward
had
all
this
time
never
spoken
word
good
or
bad
but
had
served
them
with
the
utmost
obsequiousness
and
when
they
had
at
length
ceased
from
feeding
he
went
and
gave
the
master
an
account
of
the
repast
which
proved
a
source
of
great
divertisement
to
him
i
have
not
said
he
for
these
many
years
had
any
desire
to
trifle
with
the
beings
to
whose
species
i
once
belonged
but
this
group
surpasses
all
of
their
kind
i
will
therefore
lay
aside
my
profound
studies
and
be
with
them
as
one
of
themselves
if
it
were
but
to
torment
them
i
will
indulge
in
this
idle
and
vain
humour
i
have
almost
forgot
how
human
passions
work
i
pray
of
thee
master
said
gourlay
that
thou
wilt
suffer
me
to
slay
yon
grim
and
snarling
dog
in
the
grey
frock
i
loathe
hate
and
abhor
him
he
is
moreover
a
bit
of
a
necromancer
himself
and
has
the
insolence
to
suppose
that
he
can
rival
you
in
power
it
is
there
i
long
to
try
him
said
the
master
in
power
i
brook
no
rival
in
this
or
any
other
land
as
thou
thyself
and
thy
wretched
companion
in
bondage
can
witness
there
is
only
one
thing
in
this
weak
man
in
shape
of
a
friar
that
i
fear
and
that
thing
shall
be
nameless
perhaps
i
may
commission
thee
to
take
him
away
in
the
mean
time
remove
the
remainder
of
their
wretched
viands
and
bring
me
in
a
vessel
full
of
the
strong
wine
of
palestine
mixed
up
with
the
essence
of
many
spirits
it
is
a
beverage
fit
for
gods
in
it
will
i
pledge
these
deranged
mortals
and
thou
shalt
see
some
sport
for
once
if
aught
on
earth
can
divert
thee
certes
i
shall
be
diverted
great
master
of
arts
i
hope
you
will
favour
them
with
a
touch
of
by
way
of
example
by
and
by
gourlay
all
in
good
time
in
the
mean
while
let
us
deal
with
them
as
men
and
as
gentlemen
and
before
i
metamorphose
them
into
quadrupeds
let
us
see
what
kind
of
beings
they
will
make
of
themselves
the
master
accordingly
entered
the
room
where
his
guests
still
sat
round
the
board
all
of
them
rose
and
made
obeisance
but
without
returning
the
courtesy
he
took
his
seat
at
the
end
of
the
table
next
to
the
door
and
was
just
about
to
address
them
when
he
was
interrupted
by
charlie
scott
there
were
two
great
individuals
always
uppermost
in
charlie
mind
these
were
his
master
the
warden
and
his
horse
corby
and
finding
himself
again
in
the
master
presence
and
thinking
he
rather
looked
better
pleased
than
he
was
wont
he
judged
it
prudent
not
to
let
the
opportunity
slip
so
after
scratching
his
head
violently
with
both
hands
he
thus
preferred
his
solicitation
gude
faith
master
scott
i
glad
i
hae
seen
you
again
and
nae
disparagement
either
to
you
or
your
house
sir
knight
but
the
truth
is
we
canna
bide
here
for
in
the
first
place
you
see
our
skins
will
gang
to
the
bauks
in
a
jiffey
and
in
the
next
place
our
captain
the
warden
canna
want
us
it
is
far
mair
than
our
lives
are
worth
for
us
to
stay
here
for
troth
sir
master
the
lives
o
others
depend
on
it
now
i
wadna
like
that
we
were
trowed
to
be
corbie
messengers
and
that
brings
me
sir
knight
how
muckle
need
i
hae
to
be
at
the
mill
down
by
there
i
hae
a
friend
at
it
that
i
fear
is
in
nae
good
plight
content
you
gallant
squire
for
a
space
said
the
master
i
do
intend
to
answer
the
request
of
my
noble
kinsman
with
all
expedition
but
such
things
can
not
be
done
in
a
moment
i
must
read
the
face
of
the
heavens
and
listen
to
the
voices
from
the
deep
below
i
have
likewise
a
master
to
consult
he
has
another
and
both
are
as
perverse
as
hell
itself
be
content
therefore
and
enjoy
yourselves
for
the
remainder
of
this
day
give
me
all
your
names
that
i
may
register
them
and
give
me
them
truly
every
one
gave
his
name
and
designation
save
that
the
poet
gave
the
name
of
the
lovely
delany
with
an
encomium
on
her
beauty
and
virtue
but
michael
cared
for
none
of
those
things
what
appeared
beautiful
in
the
eyes
of
other
men
to
his
were
loathsomeness
and
deformity
far
different
was
the
case
when
the
friar
announced
his
own
name
michael
started
to
his
feet
and
with
spread
hands
and
every
feature
of
his
countenance
dilated
with
joy
he
exclaimed
what
primate
of
douay
in
france
and
author
of
the
book
of
arts
the
same
great
sir
said
the
friar
i
confide
it
to
you
but
haply
thou
dost
not
know
in
this
thy
retired
habitation
that
men
thirst
for
my
blood
that
i
am
a
persecuted
man
and
have
suffered
imprisonments
bonds
wounds
yea
and
tortures
that
i
have
been
hunted
from
nation
to
nation
and
from
land
to
land
until
i
found
shelter
and
protection
among
these
wild
and
reckless
borderers
a
people
that
neither
fear
god
nor
regard
man
with
them
have
i
taken
up
my
abode
i
am
become
a
father
to
them
and
they
are
as
children
unto
me
i
love
them
but
if
they
should
be
induced
to
give
me
up
wo
would
be
unto
me
what
d
ye
say
man
said
charlie
grasping
his
hand
d
ye
think
a
scot
amang
us
wad
gie

up
if
there
be
sic
a
man
in
the
border
array
he
ought
to
be

ned
but
i
trow
i
ken
a
bit
o
the
warden
mind
there
and
i
can
tell

the
pens
and
a
the
rapiers

if
ever

he
maun
gie
up
himsel
and
mak
his
ain
conditions
too
great
and
notable
primate
you
are
welcome
to
this
castle
said
the
master
whether
by
the
title
of
monk
prior
primate
or
friar
i
say
you
are
welcome
here
i
have
ridden
a
thousand
miles
to
meet
with
you
but
that
is
long
agone
i
had
heard
of
your
great
skill
in
the
sublime
arts
that
surpass
the
comprehension
of
ordinary
men
and
i
determined
to
stake
my
life
on
the
trial
of
skill
between
us
i
was
disappointed
in
meeting
with
you
for
you
were
not
to
be
found
dead
or
alive
the
days
of
my
ambition
are
fled
my
power
has
been
acknowledged
so
long
none
daring
to
contend
with
me
that
indifference
hath
ensued
after
that
came
disgust
and
with
it
misery
thou
art
the
man
of
all
the
earth
whose
fame
i
have
envied
and
if
thou
darest
i
will
contend
with
thee
for
freedom
or
for
life
which
thou
wilt
if
thou
art
overcome
thou
shalt
be
my
bondsman
and
slave
and
if
thou
conquerest
i
will
submit
to
be
thine
lo
i
will
contend
with
thee
even
for
name
and
being
said
the
friar
of
the
of
sin
and
satan
am
i
not
afraid
i
have
put
the
ministers
of
thy
vengeance
to
flight
already
and
i
will
chase
yea
i
will
overcome
and
pursue
them
away
as
chaff
is
driven
before
the
wind
will
i
scatter
them
dare
not
to
contend
with
me
for
if
i
judge
aright
my
master
holdeth
thine
in
chains
and
if
i
interfere
thou
canst
do
nothing
i
judge
it
therefore
best
to
contend
as
brothers
contend
to
admire
what
is
truly
great
and
deride
that
which
is
insignificant
mine
are
the
arts
of
peace
truth
and
righteousness
and
i
hoped
thine
were
the
same
why
art
thou
not
a
monk
a
follower
of
the
wretched
maniac
benedict
of
padua
that
driveller
in
hidden
mysteries
said
the
master
i
do
not
rightly
comprehend
thee
or
by
what
power
thou
didst
thwart
my
servants
tell
me
in
one
word
art
thou
not
in
combination
with
the
potent
elemental
spirits
that
rule
and
controul
the
earth
the
air
the
fire
and
the
waters
if
not
thy
arts
are
superficial
and
worthless
thou
shalt
see
and
thou
shalt
judge
said
the
friar
i
am
not
ashamed
of
that
i
can
do
and
with
that
he
went
and
brought
up
his
huge
portmanteau
in
which
he
always
carried
many
a
small
and
curious
apparatus
but
these
he
kept
carefully
concealed
having
suffered
so
much
from
the
superstitions
of
bigotted
and
illiterate
men
in
the
course
of
his
profound
researches
he
was
the
greatest
chemist
that
had
ever
appeared
on
the
stage
of
existence
yet
that
curious
and
refined
art
was
he
obliged
carefully
to
conceal
having
been
persecuted
as
a
necromancer
over
every
kingdom
of
southern
europe
when
he
went
away
charlie
scott
was
terribly
in
the
fidgets
he
expected
instantly
to
witness
the
raising
of
the
devil
and
other
infernal
spirits
against
whom
he
cherished
the
most
inveterate
dislike
his
eyes
began
to
set
in
his
head
and
the
roof
of
his
mouth
became
so
dry
that
he
could
not
pronounce
words
distinctly
gude
faith
sir
master
said
he
i
dinna
appruve
of
a
man
setting
up
his
birse
and
braving
a
gentleman
in
his
ain
house
and
wi
your
permission
i
hae
something
o
great
importance
to
do
at
the
mill
sae
i
step
down
that
length
and
i
shall
come
up
again
the
morning
by
please
to
remain
with
your
friends
good
yeoman
said
the
master
you
shall
witness
something
worth
your
while
what
can
you
possibly
have
to
do
at
the
mill
muckle
muckle
to
do
at
the
mill
sir
knight
i
just
refer
it
to
yoursel
can
either
man
or
beast
leeve
wanting
drink
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
master
i
had
almost
forgot
my
principal
errand
gourlay
fill
me
a
glass
of
the
wine
of
palestine
the
steward
did
as
he
was
ordered
and
the
master
taking
the
cup
drank
to
the
health
of
his
kinsman
the
warden
and
all
his
friends
every
one
of
his
guests
did
the
same
save
the
maiden
and
boy
and
every
eye
was
cleared
and
every
heart
warmed
for
the
liquor
was
as
strong
as
brandy
weel
sir
knight
said
charlie
that
is
what
ane
wad
ca
rather
stiff
sturdy
drink
i
hae
nae
tasted
ought
as
weel
worth
the
drinking
and
if
ye
will
just
gar
auld
crossgrains
come
ower
us
again
i
think
i
could
even
prevail
on
mysel
to
face
the
deil
and
let
corby
tak
his
chance
the
request
was
instantly
complied
with
each
of
them
got
another
cup
and
the
friar
having
tarried
a
while
to
put
his
affairs
in
order
when
he
came
back
the
tongues
of
all
his
companions
were
going
at
once
and
he
was
apprehensive
that
they
were
bewitched
he
however
took
the
pledge
in
one
full
cup
and
was
greatly
revived
by
it
but
refused
taking
another
at
that
time
the
room
in
which
they
sat
was
lighted
by
four
windows
those
to
the
east
and
west
were
small
circular
ones
having
a
pane
of
bright
glass
in
each
those
to
the
north
and
south
were
merely
long
slits
in
the
wall
without
any
glass
and
the
first
thing
the
friar
did
before
producing
the
specimens
of
his
art
was
to
close
up
all
these
windows
so
as
to
exclude
the
light
of
day
and
the
glass
of
the
western
one
he
either
contrived
to
remove
substituting
another
in
its
place
or
else
he
put
another
piece
of
magnifying
glass
over
it
when
he
began
up
the
last
charlie
entered
a
vehement
protest
against
it
on
the
ground
that
no
body
would
see
what
he
did
or
what
he
raised
and
any
one
might
be
seized
by
the
neck
ere
ever
he
was
aware
by
some
o
his
infernal
deils
i
hate
a
surprises
added
he
it
best
keeping
the
crown
o
the
fell
and
seeing
weel
about
ane
room
to
fight
and
room
to
flee
an
ye
like
maister
wha
do
you
think
gaun
to
play
at
wi
the
deil
in
sic
a
place
as
this
the
master
in
a
sneering
manner
requested
that
the
great
enchanter
might
have
his
own
way
and
charlie
whose
tongue
was
a
little
loosed
by
the
wine
of
palestine
was
at
last
restrained
though
not
without
a
good
deal
of
grumbling
and
fidgetting
the
room
was
darkened
the
friar
went
into
a
small
alcove
and
by
the
help
of
a
magic
lanthorn
a
thing
never
before
seen
in
scotland
he
raised
up
a
tremendous
and
horrid
figure
on
the
wall
it
was
of
gigantic
size
its
eyes
lips
and
paws
moved
and
its
body
was
thrown
into
various
contortions
all
were
in
breathless
silence
on
the
appearance
of
this
extraordinary
shade
but
among
the
darkling
group
there
was
distinctly
heard
one
whose
breathing
was
frequently
cut
short
as
if
something
had
been
choking
him
or
seizing
him
by
the
throat
after
the
apparition
had
gone
through
its
various
evolutions
all
apparently
at
the
further
end
of
the
apartment
it
fixed
its
eyes
clenched
its
teeth
and
stretching
forth
its
claws
it
appeared
to
make
a
spring
forward
at
the
party
aih
l
d
be
here
cried
charlie
in
a
trumpet
voice
and
threw
himself
flat
down
behind
the
rest
hearing
that
some
of
them
laughed
at
the
fright
he
had
got
he
ventured
to
speak
and
expostulate
a
little
but
no
curiosity
could
induce
him
to
raise
his
face
from
the
floor
or
open
his
eyes
again
while
the
friar
exhibition
continued
lair
him
lair
him
friar
cried
he
or
od
i
be
about
your
lugs
some
day
for
this
lair
him
lair
him
in
the
name
of
st
michael
and
if
that
winna
do
try
him
wi
peter
he
send
him
ower
the
battlements
like
a
shot
o
good
friar
whatever
ye
do
lair
him
the
friar
went
on
with
his
phantasmagoria
the
figure
after
giving
a
shiver
or
two
was
parted
into
three
all
of
the
same
form
and
size
but
all
making
different
motions
and
different
contortions
of
feature
the
three
were
afterwards
parted
into
six
which
among
other
grotesque
feats
danced
a
reel
and
on
running
thro
it
every
one
threw
itself
the
group
of
onlookers
laughed
outright
at
this
notwithstanding
their
astonishment
and
called
to
charlie
to
look
but
he
would
not
move
his
face
from
the
earth
and
only
asked
in
a
voice
is
he
no
laired
yet
od
i
shall
be
about
that
cursed
body
for
his
tricks
when
the
friar
had
concluded
this
feat
he
put
out
his
small
lanthorn
took
the
machinery
out
of
it
concealing
it
beneath
his
ample
frock
and
again
opened
all
the
windows
charlie
got
up
and
running
to
one
of
the
gude
be
thankit
i
get
a
cooke
o
the
air
o
heaven
again
said
he
for
i
hae
been
breathing
fire
and
brimstone
this
while
byegane
foul
befa
me
gin
ever
i
saw
the
like
o
yon
i
was
sair
dumfoundered
but
wha
could
stand
afore
the
face
of
a
fiery
giant
the
friar
associates
looked
at
the
lanthorn
examining
it
with
curious
eyes
but
perceived
nothing
about
it
which
could
in
any
way
account
for
the
apparition
they
had
seen
master
michael
scott
did
not
deign
to
ask
a
sight
of
it
but
paced
over
the
floor
in
sullen
and
thoughtful
mood
the
seneschal
stood
fixed
to
the
spot
on
which
he
had
witnessed
the
phenomenon
with
his
heavy
unmoving
eyes
turned
towards
his
master
he
seemed
dubious
whether
he
was
vanquished
or
not
the
master
at
length
spoke
addressing
the
friar
i
hope
right
worshipful
primate
this
is
not
the
extent
of
your
knowledge
and
power
in
the
sublime
art
of
divination
the
whole
is
only
a
delusion
a
shadow
a
phantom
calculated
to
astonish
women
or
children
i
acknowledge
it
to
be
ingenious
still
it
is
nothing
you
multiplied
your
shadows
turning
three
into
six
now
if
i
turn
three
men
into
six
living
breathing
substantial
beings
will
you
acknowledge
yourself
outdone
certes
i
will
said
the
friar
away
then
with
deception
said
the
master
what
i
do
i
do
in
the
open
eye
of
stand
forth
three
of
you
master
michael
scott
i
tell
you
what
it

charlie

parted
into
twa
you
shall
neither
suffer
nor
feel
the
least
inconvenience
by
the
change
brave
yeoman
said
the
master
therefore
be
not
afraid
but
stand
forth
charlie
hung
his
head
to
one
side
in
a
deep
reverie
till
at
length
his
countenance
lightened
up
by
degrees
his
features
opening
into
a
broad
smile
i
tell
you
what
it
is
sir
knight
said
he
if
you
will
assure
me
that
baith
o
us

as
stout
and
as
wight
chaps
as
i
am

now
gude
faith
i
dinna
care
though
ye
mak
me
into
twa
for
my
master
the
warden
sake
if
you
could
double
an
army
that
gate
it
wad
be
a
great
matter
i
doubt
sair
i
cast
out
wi
my
tither
half
about
something
that
i
ken
o
and
that
corby
but
i
run
the
risk
nane
o
your
cutfing
and
cleaving
however
sir
knight
nane
o
your
imps
their
gully
knives
again
charlie
stepped
up
the
floor
and
took
his
stand
with
his
back
at
the
wall
to
await
doggedly
this
multiplication
of
himself
tam
soon
joined
him
but
there
was
a
hard
contest
between
gibbie
and
the
poet
both
of
whom
were
rather
personal
cowards
and
both
alike
averse
to
such
experiments
the
former
was
at
length
obliged
to
yield
for
carol
clung
so
close
to
the
maid
that
nothing
could
induce
him
to
part
from
her
and
ever
since
the
friar
gave
him
the
grievous
overthrow
he
had
lost
all
confidence
in
his
personal
prowess
michael
stamped
thrice
with
his
heel
and
spoke
some
words
in
an
unknown
tongue
in
a
low
muttering
tone
but
some
of
them
heard
the
sounds
of
prig
prim
and
pricker
there
was
a
momentary
confusion
in
the
apartment
a
darkening
haze
flashed
over
it
and
blinded
the
eyes
of
men
for
a
short
space
the
floor
gave
a
shake
as
if
it
had
sunk
down
a
little
and
there
stood
two
of
each
of
the
three
friends
so
completely
alike
that
no
one
knew
who
was
who
no
scene
could
be
more
truly
ludicrous
than
the
one
which
now
ensued
each
man
turned
to
his
prototype
and
the
looks
of
confusion
and
astonishment
in
both
being
the
same
the
beholders
were
seized
with
irrepressible
laughter
charlie
felt
his
legs
thighs
and
ribs
if
they
remained
the
same
as
before
the
other
boardly
personage
in
the
same
shape
followed
his
example
and
added
gude
faith
the
like
o
this
i
saw
never
you
may
weel
said
the
other
but
let
me
see
if
you
can
draw
that
lang
sword
as
weel
an
as
cleverly
as
i
can
do
gude
lord
hear
til
him
said
the
first
he
speaking
as
he
were
the
true
charlie
scott
himsel
speak
ye
friend
were
you
me
before
this
that
is
did
you
ride
with
the
warden
over
the
border
i
am
sure
if
you
were
there
i
never
saw
you
before
said
the
second
speaker
but
i
dinna
ken
what
i
am
saying
for
the
truth
is
i
dinna
comprehend
this
with
that
they
again
gazed
at
each
other
and
looked
over
their
shoulders
as
if
they
would
not
have
cared
to
have
fled
from
one
another
presence
with
every
pair
the
scene
was
much
the
same
tam
was
so
much
astonished
that
he
turned
to
his
second
self
cowered
down
leaning
his
hands
upon
his
knees
and
made
a
staunch
point
at
him
the
other
took
precisely
the
same
posture
so
that
their
long
noses
almost
met
the
maid
the
poet
and
the
boy
screamed
with
laughter
both
of
the
tams
laughed
too
so
that
they
very
much
resembled
an
ideot
looking
at
himself
in
a
glass
friend
i
canna
say
but
ye
very
like
me
said
gibbie
to
his
partner
but
though
nane
o
us
be
great
beauties
ye
look
rather
the
warst
o
the
twae
it
brings
me
o
a
story
i
hae
heard
my
mother
tell
said
the
other
of
a
lady
and
her
twa
blackamores
what
the
deil
man
exclaimed
the
first
did
your
mother
tell
that
story
too
ay
wha
else
but
she
tauld
it
i
say
my
mother
auld
effy
blakely
of
the
peatstacknowe
eh
she
your
mother
it
is
gayan
queer
if
we
be
baith
ane
after
a
for
i
never
had
a
billy
the
two
gibbies
then
both
began
to
tell
stories
which
each
claimed
as
originally
his
so
that
the
perplexity
still
increased
nor
was
it
better
when
the
parties
began
to
mix
and
address
each
other
all
spoke
of
themselves
as
the
right
and
proper
persons
and
of
the
others
as
beings
in
their
likenesses
and
the
most
complete
uncertainty
prevailed
but
just
as
the
novelty
and
interest
of
the
drama
began
to
subside
michael
by
a
wave
of
his
hand
annihilated
the
three
additional
personages
and
all
remained
as
it
was
before
the
grand
exhibition
commenced
save
that
our
group
had
got
a
new
topic
of
conversation
and
merriment
primate
of
douay
so
celebrated
for
thy
mighty
enchantments
how
thinkest
thou
of
this
said
the
master
that
thou
hast
done
what
no
man
could
have
done
beside
said
the
friar
and
that
thy
power
even
surpasseth
that
of
the
magicians
of
egypt
and
of
those
of
the
countries
in
the
lands
of
the
east
but
in
one
thing
my
power
is
even
as
thy
power
dost
thou
know
that
i
could
have
prevented
thy
charm
and
put
a
period
to
thy
enchantment
at
my
will
and
pleasure
it
is
not
the
power
of
prevention
that
we
are
trying
said
the
master
suffer
my
servants
to
do
their
work
as
i
shall
suffer
thine
and
we
shall
then
see
who
are
most
punctually
obeyed
and
who
shall
perform
the
greatest
works
only
if
i
prevail
in
all
things
you
will
surely
have
the
generosity
to
acknowledge
that
my
master
is
greater
than
thine
wo
be
unto
me
if
such
a
confession
proceed
out
of
my
lips
said
the
friar
who
can
be
greater
than
he
who
builded
the
stories
of
heaven
and
laid
the
foundations
of
this
earth
below
who
lighted
up
the
sun
sending
him
abroad
in
brightness
and
in
glory
and
placed
the
moon
and
the
stars
in
the
firmament
on
high
who
is
greater
than
he
who
hath
made
the
mountains
to
stand
the
seas
to
roll
and
the
winds
to
blow
who
hath
not
only
made
the
souls
of
men
but
all
the
spirits
of
the
upper
and
nether
world
peace
thou
maniac
cried
the
master
interrupting
the
friar
in
a
voice
that
made
him
leap
from
the
floor
comest
thou
here
to
babble
treason
against
the
master
whom
i
serve
and
the
mighty
spirits
with
whom
i
am
in
league
do
what
thou
canst
do
and
cease
from
speaking
evil
of
dignities
what
knowest
thou
of
the
principalities
and
powers
that
inhabit
and
rule
over
the
various
regions
of
the
universe
no
more
than
the
mole
that
grovelleth
beneath
the
what
further
canst
thou
do
in
proof
of
thy
profound
art
behold
with
thine
eyes
o
thou
who
accountest
thyself
the
greatest
among
the
children
of
men
said
the
friar
with
a
waggish
air
that
i
will
but
speak
the
word
and
the
mountains
shall
be
rent
asunder
and
the
tops
of
the
everlasting
hills
stand
in
opposition
knowest
thou
the
proper
name
figure
and
dimensions
of
that
peaked
mountain
over
against
the
castle
to
the
west
well
may
i
know
it
said
the
master
for
i
have
looked
out
on
it
these
fifty
years
and
many
a
hundred
times
have
i
followed
the
chase
around
it
it
is
named
and
the
mountain
is
my
own
mountain
of
hear
my
voice
cried
the
friar
in
the
same
waggish
tone
in
which
there
was
an
affectation
of
sublime
command
thou
hast
borne
the
footsteps
of
thy
great
master
and
his
black
horse
beelzebub
yet
hast
thou
neither
been
scorched
nor
rent
yea
though
he
hath
cursed
thee
in
the
bitterness
of
ire
yet
hath
thy
grey
head
never
been
but
behold
a
greater
than
thy
master
is
here
mountain
of
hear
my
voice
be
thou
rent
asunder
and
divided
into
three
that
thy
owner
may
look
on
thee
and
be
astonied
if
it
please
thee
mighty
magician
look
out
on
thy
mountain
of
now
many
a
thousand
times
had
the
master
looked
out
at
that
circular
window
every
bush
and
grey
stone
on
the
hill
were
familiar
to
him
and
all
unsuspicious
of
the
simple
deceit
that
had
been
practised
on
him
he
went
and
looked
forth
from
the
window
when
in
the
place
where
one
round
peaked
mountain
was
wont
to
be
he
actually
saw
three
all
of
the
same
dimensions
and
as
he
weened
each
of
them
more
steep
tall
and
romantic
than
the
original
one
had
been
he
looked
and
looked
again
the
optical
delusion
was
complete
he
paced
the
floor
in
sullen
mood
muttered
some
sentences
to
himself
in
an
under
tone
and
once
more
looked
forth
on
the
singular
phenomenon
the
mountains
remained
the
same
they
could
not
be
seen
from
any
other
window
and
no
one
thought
of
descending
to
the
great
balcony
so
that
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
friar
remained
triumphant
the
master
could
not
brook
this
he
strode
the
floor
in
gloomy
indignation
and
at
length
they
heard
him
saying
if
i
should
venture
to
demand
it
but
is
it
then
to
be
my
last
great
work
the
demand
is
dreadful
i
will
i
demand
it
never
shall
it
be
said
that
michael
scott
was
in
his
own
art
and
that
by
a
poor
peddling
friar
come
all
of
you
hither
added
he
in
a
louder
tone
look
at
that
mountain
to
the
east
it
is
known
to
you
all
the
great
hill
of
eildon
you
see
and
know
that
it
is
one
round
smooth
and
unbroken
cone
we
all
know
it
and
have
known
it
from
infancy
was
the
general
answer
the
master
gave
three
strokes
with
his
heel
and
called
the
names
of
his
three
elfin
pages
who
in
an
instant
stood
before
work
master
work
what
work
now
look
at
that
mountain
to
the
east
said
he
ycleped
the
hill
of
eildon
go
and
twist
me
it
into
three
the
pages
grinned
looking
at
him
with
eyes
of
a
devilish
gleam
as
a
ravenous
creature
eyes
its
prey
the
hill
is
a
granite
rock
said
one
and
five
high
said
another
and
seventy
round
the
base
said
the
first
all
the
powers
of
earth
and
hell
to
boot
are
unmeet
to
the
task
added
the
third
thou
art
a
proud
and
impertinent
liar
perverse
imp
of
the
regions
of
flame
said
the
master
note
this
the
thing
must
and
shall
be
done
even
though
a
body
and
soul
should
both
be
given
up
as
the
guerdon
i
know
my
conditions
they
are
sealed
and
subscribed
and
i
am
not
to
be
disobeyed
get
to
your
work
without
more
hesitation
the
three
pages
then
fell
to
reeling
about
and
about
singing
a
wild
and
uncouth
trio
in
words
of
the
following
import
pick
and
spade
to
our
aid
flaught
and
flail
fire
and
hail
winds
arise
and
tempests
brattle
and
if
you
will
the
thunders
rattle
come
away
elfin
grey
much
to
do
ere
break
of
day
come
with
spade
and
sieve
and
shovel
come
with
roar
and
rout
and
revel
come
with
crow
and
come
with
crane
strength
of
steed
and
weight
of
wain
crash
of
rock
and
roar
of
river
and
if
you
will
with
thunders
shiver
come
away
elfin
grey
much
to
do
ere
break
of
day
as
they
sung
these
last
lines
they
reeled
out
at
the
door
in
a
circular
motion
so
rapid
that
the
eye
dazzled
which
looked
on
them
the
poet
drawn
involuntarily
by
the
ears
after
that
wild
fairy
lay
hasted
out
after
them
he
looked
east
and
west
and
all
around
but
he
only
saw
three
crows
winging
their
flight
toward
the
hill
of
eildon
from
the
time
of
their
departure
the
temper
of
the
great
master
became
extremely
variable
at
one
time
his
visage
would
be
clouded
with
the
gloom
of
despair
and
at
another
lighted
up
with
a
sort
of
horrid
exultation
but
he
spake
not
save
to
himself
the
friar
therefore
in
order
to
divert
his
host
and
gratify
his
own
vanity
proposed
to
show
off
some
more
wonders
of
his
art
accordingly
he
closed
up
all
the
windows
once
more
making
the
apartment
as
dark
as
pitch
and
exercised
many
curious
chemical
devices
lighted
roman
candles
and
made
them
dance
about
the
chamber
in
every
colour
of
the
rainbow
he
was
still
busily
employed
playing
off
his
little
ingenious
tricks
when
the
party
were
disturbed
by
a
bustle
in
one
of
the
corners
it
chanced
to
be
so
dark
at
the
moment
that
no
one
could
see
what
was
going
on
but
they
heard
a
noise
as
of
two
people
struggling
then
a
blow
and
one
falling
down
with
a
groan
the
friar
paused
calling
out
and
enquiring
what
it
was
charlie
never
behind
in
a
fray
bustled
over
the
forms
toward
the
scene
of
action
but
falling
by
the
way
the
noise
was
quickly
removed
to
another
corner
a
door
was
opened
and
shut
and
all
was
again
quiet
every
one
ran
about
groping
his
way
in
the
dark
and
coming
full
drive
against
others
till
the
friar
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
pull
the
stuffing
out
of
some
of
the
windows
the
first
thing
they
then
saw
was
the
poet
lying
on
the
floor
void
of
sense
and
motion
and
then
it
quickly
appeared
that
the
steward
and
delany
were
the
whole
party
save
the
master
set
out
on
the
pursuit
headed
by
the
friar
and
charlie
and
came
just
in
time
to
rescue
the
maid
as
the
wretch
was
dragging
her
into
his
abominable
cell
it
seemed
that
he
had
determined
on
seizing
her
as
his
prey
and
now
that
the
three
infernal
pages
his
tormentors
were
dispatched
elsewhere
he
feared
neither
the
master
nor
his
guests
and
taking
advantage
of
the
utter
darkness
and
of
the
poet
and
her
being
in
a
corner
by
themselves
he
stole
up
to
them
gagged
the
maid
silenced
the
poet
who
resisted
with
one
blow
and
then
bore
off
the
helpless
lady
with
all
expedition
when
he
saw
that
he
was
overtaken
and
overpowered
by
numbers
he
only
laughed
at
them
and
assured
them
that
in
spite
of
all
they
could
do
he
would
have
possession
of
her
and
that
they
should
see
the
girl
wept
and
complained
of
being
hurt
but
then
he
only
laughed
and
mocked
the
louder
some
of
them
proposed
that
they
should
hew
him
all
to
pieces
but
the
friar
had
resolved
on
his
measures
and
at
his
request
they
took
the
culprit
up
before
the
master
and
there
lodged
their
accusations
against
him
but
the
master
either
durst
not
or
would
not
say
a
word
against
him
for
in
fact
it
appeared
that
this
great
man
without
his
familiar
spirits
shrunk
into
nothing
and
was
not
only
afraid
of
his
own
bondsman
but
of
every
thing
around
him
deeming
himself
altogether
without
help
the
friar
eye
burned
with
indignation
and
rage
at
witnessing
such
arrogance
on
the
one
hand
and
imbecility
on
the
other
but
his
bootless
wrath
only
delighted
the
steward
the
more
and
it
was
evident
that
had
it
not
been
for
fear
of
charlie
scott
long
sword
and
heavy
hand
he
would
have
taken
his
prey
from
the
midst
of
them
delany
still
wept
and
sobbed
till
her
bosom
was
like
to
rend
and
begged
to
be
taken
away
from
the
castle
or
to
be
killed
and
put
in
her
grave
the
friar
tried
with
all
the
fair
and
kind
speeches
he
was
master
of
to
comfort
her
but
when
she
saw
the
poet
pale
bleeding
and
sitting
still
unable
to
rise
she
only
waxed
worse
and
hid
herself
from
the
eye
of
the
wretch
behind
the
friar
frock
daughter
of
my
love
and
child
of
many
misfortunes
be
thou
comforted
said
the
friar
for
though
the
wicked
triumph
for
a
space
in
their
iniquity
yet
shall
they
not
thrive
they
who
refuse
to
do
justice
to
the
innocent
and
upright
in
heart
shall
perish
in
their
sin
and
pass
away
as
the
smoke
that
is
driven
by
the
wind
therefore
my
daughter
be
thou
comforted
and
that
thy
heart
may
be
cheered
i
will
show
thee
a
wonder
of
my
art
a
wonder
so
great
that
whosoever
seeth
it
his
heart
shall
melt
within
him
and
whosoever
heareth
of
it
his
ears
shall
tingle
come
whoso
listeth
forth
into
the
open
air
and
i
will
do
it
in
the
sight
of
heaven
and
of
man
the
friar
then
lifting
up
his
huge
portmanteau
went
forth
to
the
large
paved
gateway
that
surrounded
the
whole
of
the
uppermost
arches
of
the
castle
it
was
so
ample
as
to
be
like
a
small
field
for
it
covered
all
the
castle
save
four
small
pointed
turrets
and
the
square
apartment
which
the
party
now
left
that
rose
like
a
shapeless
dome
above
all
in
one
corner
of
this
level
battlement
there
stood
a
leaden
vessel
that
had
once
been
used
as
a
cistern
to
that
the
friar
went
and
laying
down
his
huge
walise
he
took
from
thence
a
handful
of
blackish
sand
and
strinkled
it
all
around
the
battlement
on
the
one
side
to
the
opposite
corner
he
then
stood
and
looked
awfully
around
him
he
looked
to
the
heavens
but
they
were
shrouded
in
a
dark
hideous
cloud
that
now
covered
the
mountains
and
hung
lowering
over
the
uppermost
spire
of
the
castle
neither
the
nor
the
hill
of
eildon
could
be
seen
nor
could
aught
be
seen
save
the
dark
and
troubled
cloud
the
scene
was
truly
impressive
and
when
the
rest
saw
the
friar
looking
on
it
with
such
apparent
dread
all
of
them
looked
abroad
with
him
and
whispered
to
one
another
he
gaun
to
be
about
some
awesome
enchantment
now
the
friar
covered
up
his
pormanteau
with
the
leaden
vessel
and
then
desired
the
master
to
bring
any
weight
he
chose
and
heap
it
on
its
bottom
which
he
had
now
turned
uppermost
and
at
one
word
or
sign
he
would
make
his
wallet
carry
the
vessel
and
all
such
weight
round
the
battlements
of
the
castle
the
master
and
every
one
present
pronounced
the
thing
to
be
impossible
the
steward
grinned
in
derision
and
after
mocking
and
taunting
the
friar
on
his
art
in
the
most
gross
and
provoking
terms
he
proffered
to
hold
down
the
leaden
tub
wallet
and
altogether
or
to
forfeit
his
head
if
he
failed
then
laying
himself
over
it
in
the
attitude
of
holding
it
down
he
called
on
the
friar
to
proceed
and
give
him
the
promised
canter
round
the
walls
which
he
well
deserved
he
said
not
only
for
his
kindness
to
them
all
and
to
their
miss
in
particular
but
also
for
his
kind
intentions
then
he
scoffed
aloud
crying
out
now
thou
poor
vain
fool
and
liar
be
as
good
as
thy
word
and
give
me
an
it
were
but
one
hobble
god
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
said
the
friar
if
i
do
not
give
thee
such
a
hobble
as
eye
hath
not
seen
with
that
he
struck
a
spark
of
fire
among
the
black
sand
as
the
rest
supposed
it
to
be
that
lay
among
his
feet
the
sand
caught
fire
the
flame
ran
sputtering
around
the
western
battlement
and
the
next
moment
the
steward
and
his
tub
bolted
away
into
the
firmament
in
a
tremendous
flash
of
fire
and
with
a
sound
so
loud
that
it
shook
the
castle
to
its
foundations
some
averred
that
they
saw
through
the
fire
and
smoke
a
momentary
glance
of
him
and
the
cistern
both
as
they
pierced
the
cloud
towards
the
north
but
nothing
further
was
heard
or
seen
and
in
a
second
of
time
all
was
quite
and
gloomy
above
and
around
as
it
had
been
before
chapter
iv
the
wind
blew
as
blawn
it
last
the
thickening
showers
rose
on
the
blast
the
speedy
gleam
the
darkness
swallowed
loud
deep
and
lang
the
thunder
bellowed
that
night
a
child
might
understand
the
deil
had
business
on
his
hand
o
long
was
it
before
any
of
the
astonished
spectators
opened
their
lips
the
shock
had
almost
deprived
them
of
sense
sight
and
motion
and
when
they
began
to
articulate
it
was
only
to
utter
short
exclamations
and
names
of
saints
tam
craik
was
the
first
who
ventured
a
remark
which
was
in
the
following
words
by
the
lord
robin
meaning
it
was
supposed
the
king
the
deil
has
flown
away
wi
him
bodily
in
a
flash
o
fire
the
great
master
stood
mute
with
astonishment
he
even
trembled
with
dread
and
appeared
once
as
if
he
would
have
fallen
at
the
friar
feet
but
he
never
said
where
is
my
seneschal
gone
whither
hast
thou
sent
him
seeming
rather
to
succumb
to
his
guests
for
the
time
being
as
a
man
utterly
at
their
mercy
his
powerful
and
malevolent
spirits
had
left
him
by
his
command
his
steward
and
only
human
attendant
had
been
blown
into
the
air
and
as
for
the
miserable
they
had
seen
no
more
of
her
since
her
escape
from
the
prison
vault
and
they
wist
not
whether
she
remained
in
the
castle
or
had
fled
from
it
out
of
dread
of
the
symbols
of
the
christian
religion
which
she
had
seen
about
the
friar
and
the
effects
of
which
she
had
felt
in
frustrating
her
potent
spells
the
wizard
had
therefore
none
to
execute
his
commands
and
appeared
a
being
quite
forlorn
as
well
as
greatly
troubled
in
his
mind
no
one
ever
knew
to
this
day
by
what
means
the
wicked
seneschal
was
borne
away
among
the
clouds
in
a
column
of
fire
and
smoke
and
those
who
witnessed
it
spread
the
word
over
the
country
that
the
devil
took
him
away
with
a
great
roar
amid
fire
and
brimstone
and
that
after
having
him
up
among
the
dark
clouds
he
tore
him
all
to
pieces
it
was
a
fact
that
one
of
the
steward
mangled
limbs
was
found
hanging
on
a
tree
among
some
thick
branches
in
the
wood
of
sheil
heuch
over
against
the
castle
which
gave
some
countenance
to
the
report
and
no
farther
remnants
of
him
were
ever
discovered
the
friar
however
knew
well
enough
by
what
means
he
was
taken
away
and
though
he
never
explained
it
as
long
as
he
remained
in
scotland
it
is
meet
that
the
readers
of
this
tale
should
know
the
truth
it
can
be
told
in
a
few
words
the
friar
had
brought
his
huge
wallet
full
of
the
strongest
gunpowder
he
had
been
able
to
make
to
shew
off
his
wonderful
feats
and
astonish
the
great
master
the
exigency
of
the
moment
induced
him
to
part
with
it
all
at
once
and
in
all
probability
he
could
not
have
caused
so
much
astonishment
by
any
experiment
he
could
have
put
in
practice
he
was
guilty
however
of
a
manifest
oversight
one
that
had
well
nigh
proved
fatal
to
the
whole
party
in
its
consequences
when
they
found
themselves
freed
from
their
vile
persecutor
and
the
great
master
rather
their
prisoner
than
they
his
their
first
thought
was
of
departing
from
that
unhallowed
place
and
awaiting
in
the
neighbourhood
the
wizard
final
answer
without
which
they
durst
not
well
return
to
the
warden
charlie
jumped
on
the
battlement
with
very
joy
that
he
would
now
get
down
to
the
mill
to
see
what
was
become
of
corby
and
how
he
fared
and
he
was
the
first
man
to
proceed
down
the
narrow
leading
the
way
to
the
fair
fields
but
alas
how
transient
are
all
sublunary
joys
and
hopes
in
the
middle
of
this
confined
and
difficult
stair
just
at
its
darkest
and
most
acute
turn
there
was
a
massive
iron
door
which
charlie
ran
his
nose
against
in
his
descent
and
soon
found
to
his
mortification
and
disappointment
that
it
was
locked
and
double
locked
he
returned
to
those
above
with
the
dismal
information
the
countenance
fell
and
he
became
pale
as
ashes
when
it
was
thus
brought
to
his
recollection
that
he
had
not
only
blown
the
brutal
seneschal
to
the
devil
but
that
he
had
blown
the
keys
of
the
castle
along
with
him
and
there
were
they
left
on
the
roof
to
perish
with
hunger
after
many
ineffectual
attempts
to
break
open
that
door
having
no
other
resource
they
agreed
to
go
to
the
topmost
tower
and
there
unite
their
voices
in
order
to
raise
the
country
to
their
assistance
for
without
ropes
and
ladders
they
saw
no
means
of
escape
accordingly
they
ascended
and
uttered
many
a
prolonged
and
tremendous
shout
for
the
space
of
a
whole
hour
but
these
unwonted
cries
only
drove
the
hinds
to
a
greater
distance
from
the
castle
many
of
them
had
witnessed
the
mighty
explosion
at
the
exit
of
the
seneschal
which
in
the
middle
of
the
lurid
gloom
had
a
hideous
effect
and
when
they
heard
such
long
and
loud
howls
proceeding
from
the
battlements
of
that
gloomy
and
desolate
pile
they
weened
that
a
whole
host
of
demons
had
assembled
about
it
and
kept
far
aloof
in
these
and
other
fruitless
exertions
our
hapless
prisoners
spent
the
evening
of
that
eventful
day
the
sun
or
the
blue
sky
had
not
once
appeared
since
the
break
of
morn
for
a
little
while
about
noon
the
hills
of
the
forest
were
visible
and
on
their
of
pale
shadowy
clouds
formed
a
scene
of
dark
sublimity
still
as
it
approached
toward
evening
these
clouds
came
lower
and
lower
down
upon
the
hills
and
became
more
dark
and
dense
in
their
appearance
and
precisely
at
the
close
of
day
the
storm
burst
forth
in
all
its
fury
sweeping
over
hill
and
dale
with
increasing
majesty
every
minute
the
woods
roared
and
crashed
before
the
blast
the
snow
descended
so
thick
that
in
a
short
time
every
ravine
and
sheltered
dell
was
heaped
after
that
came
sleet
and
snow
mingled
and
finally
a
driving
rain
dashed
with
such
violence
on
the
earth
that
it
seemed
as
if
a
thousand
cataracts
poured
from
the
western
heaven
to
mix
with
the
tempest
below
needless
is
it
to
describe
that
night
farther
it
was
that
on
which
the
great
battle
was
fought
in
the
camp
of
douglas
and
formerly
mentioned
in
this
momentous
it
is
therefore
apparent
that
isaac
the
curate
is
now
drawing
near
to
the
same
period
of
time
when
he
broke
off
at
a
tangent
and
left
the
camp
and
that
every
thing
will
of
course
go
on
to
the
catastrophe
without
further
interruption
kind
hearted
and
gentle
reader
be
not
too
sanguine
who
can
tell
what
is
to
fall
out
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
incidents
seem
to
have
multipled
intentionally
to
interrupt
poor
isaac
narrative
besides
let
any
one
consider
how
he
is
to
liberate
and
get
free
of
this
group
of
interesting
individuals
locked
up
as
they
were
to
perish
on
the
top
of
the
castle
of
aikwood
it
was
no
difficulty
to
isaac
he
was
one
of
those
wise
and
downright
men
who
know
that
truth
tells
always
the
best
and
to
that
maxim
he
adhered
but
the
worst
of
it
was
there
were
so
many
truths
that
any
body
may
see
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
get
them
all
narrated
in
their
proper
places
and
that
without
the
help
of
the
waggoner
the
task
could
never
have
been
effected
gude
sauf
us
but
it
is
gaun
to
be
an
awsome
night
said
charlie
scott
as
he
stepped
the
last
up
into
the
dark
apartment
in
which
the
party
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
day
and
into
which
the
storm
had
now
driven
them
once
more
gaun
to
be
said
tam
taking
up
charlie
words
i
wot
nae
what
it
is
gaun
to
be
but
it
is
an
awsome
night
already
it
brings
me
in
mind
of
a
story
said
gibbie
that
i
hae
often
heard
about
a
friar

o
st
martin
that
raised
the
deil
od

blood
of
you

word
about

cried
charlie
interrupting
him

chased
by
an
englishman

by

that
same
chap
ye
hae
named
gude
keep
me
frae
repeating
it
isna
in
his
ain
hett
hame
the
night

how
the
wind
howls
and
sobs
i
wish

aneuch
they

hear
there

mony
cauld
quarters
on
otterdale
the
night
but
there
is
some
there
that
wad
be
blithe
to
share
them
the
friar
now
set
himself
to
strike
a
light
which
at
last
he
effected
and
collecting
the
oil
which
remained
in
the
lamps
into
one
they
found
to
charlie
great
satisfaction
that
they
had
as
much
as
would
burn
besides
some
remnants
of
waxen
torches
of
all
the
huge
remains
of
their
morning
feast
that
they
had
seen
removed
from
the
table
they
could
not
find
one
vestige
even
though
the
trenchers
remained
in
the
chamber
as
it
was
termed
but
to
their
great
joy
they
found
an
article
as
precious
to
the
eyes
for
about
of
the
huge
flagon
of
the
wine
of
palestine
were
still
left
this
in
the
total
absence
of
fuel
was
a
discovery
of
some
consequence
and
the
friar
in
the
like
absence
of
a
steward
took
that
office
voluntarily
on
himself
when
the
lamp
was
kindled
the
first
thing
that
delany
did
was
to
dress
the
poor
poet
hurt
head
and
bind
it
up
with
a
napkin
this
attention
and
kindness
so
thrilled
his
heart
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
tears
and
seemed
to
rejoice
in
his
wound
and
as
both
he
and
his
adored
maiden
had
seen
the
ruffian
steward
transported
up
to
heaven
in
a
flame
of
fire
they
were
freed
from
all
terror
on
his
account
and
notwithstanding
all
the
perils
with
which
they
were
surrounded
they
appeared
composed
and
if
not
happy
were
at
least
quite
resigned
to
their
fate
the
great
master
sat
muffled
up
in
his
cloak
and
apart
by
himself
his
brows
screwed
down
into
deep
curved
wrinkles
and
his
sunken
eye
fixed
on
the
ground
the
friar
filled
a
cup
of
wine
and
bowing
presented
it
to
him
the
first
he
took
the
cup
and
drank
it
off
but
he
spoke
not
a
word
his
piercing
eyes
glimmered
round
the
chamber
he
uttered
a
loud
groan
and
apparently
sunk
again
into
his
deep
reverie
the
transportation
of
his
steward
while
in
the
very
act
of
braving
the
friar
might
made
a
terrible
impression
on
his
mind
and
he
weened
that
he
now
sat
before
his
master
before
one
that
might
send
him
on
a
voyage
of
the
same
nature
whenever
he
chose
and
therefore
he
judged
with
great
reason
that
for
a
space
it
behoved
him
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
so
dangerous
an
opponent
when
each
had
taken
a
cup
of
the
elevating
beverage
the
effect
was
delightful
all
their
cares
dangers
and
wants
faded
the
terrors
of
the
storm
that
was
still
increasing
only
startled
them
now
and
then
as
it
rattled
on
the
tower
or
yelled
thro
the
crevices
below
they
chatted
laughed
and
broke
jokes
on
each
other
till
even
the
sublime
master
was
diverted
from
his
profound
and
brooding
ideas
and
smiled
at
the
rustic
simplicity
of
the
characters
around
him
the
laird
of
the
peatstacknowe
told
a
great
number
of
his
long
stories
of
which
something
that
was
seen
said
or
done
always
reminded
him
charlie
told
confused
stories
about
battles
and
forays
and
the
poet
came
in
always
between
with
his
rythmatic
descriptions
and
allusions
until
at
one
time
the
associations
of
ideas
followed
one
another
in
a
manner
so
truly
ludicrous
that
the
enchanter
actually
laughed
till
he
had
almost
fallen
into
a
fit
a
thing
that
had
not
for
twenty
years
been
witnessed
of
him
the
tempest
still
continued
to
rage
and
the
loquacity
of
the
party
beginning
to
flag
they
became
drowsy
as
midnight
approached
the
friar
then
looking
gravely
around
him
and
laying
aside
his
hood
took
a
small
psalter
book
from
his
bosom
which
volume
also
contained
the
four
books
of
the
apocalypse
and
opening
it
reverendly
he
proposed
that
they
should
all
join
in
performing
the
evening
service
to
the
virgin
and
the
hymn
to
the
redeemer
delany
rose
from
off
the
lap
of
the
cloak
where
she
had
sat
nestling
all
the
evening
and
came
and
kneeled
down
at
the
friar
knee
the
master
started
up
with
a
look
of
indignation
stamped
on
the
floor
and
ordered
the
friar
to
put
up
his
vain
book
and
refrain
from
such
flummery
in
his
presence
the
friar
looked
at
him
with
a
steady
countenance
it
is
not
meet
that
i
should
obey
man
rather
than
god
said
he
i
have
taken
a
vow
in
the
face
of
heaven
and
i
will
pay
that
vow
in
spite
of
men
and
devils
i
will
sing
my
holy
hymns
with
these
my
friends
and
children
and
he
that
listeth
not
to
join
let
him
be
accursed
and
translated
from
the
presence
this
last
sentence
sounded
rather
equivocally
in
the
master
ears
he
liked
not
such
a
translation
as
he
had
lately
witnessed
for
with
all
his
power
and
mysterious
art
the
terrors
of
death
still
encompassed
him
about
he
held
his
peace
therefore
although
he
growled
like
a
lion
at
bay
at
being
bearded
thus
in
his
own
castle
the
friar
proceeded
as
he
had
said
and
all
the
rest
joined
him
with
becoming
devotion
save
the
poet
whose
orisons
that
night
were
somewhat
cold
he
could
not
brook
the
charm
that
drew
delany
from
his
own
side
to
his
rival
knee
the
master
sat
aloof
biting
his
lip
and
grinning
in
derision
but
at
one
part
of
the
service
although
the
curate
does
not
say
what
part
he
was
insensibly
overcome
and
fell
into
a
painful
oblivious
dream
the
strains
of
the
sacred
music
simple
as
they
were
stole
over
his
soul
as
some
remembrance
of
early
life
sometimes
steals
into
the
heart
of
enfeebled
age
reminding
the
decaying
and
dying
worm
of
joys
he
can
no
more
see
and
of
feelings
of
delight
that
have
perished
for
if
a
son
of
the
mountains
of
the
north
were
transported
to
some
far
foreign
clime
and
there
doomed
to
remain
for
life
after
sojourning
in
that
land
for
half
an
age
until
grey
and
bowed
down
if
by
chance
on
some
still
evening
or
mayhap
through
the
eddies
of
the
storm
one
of
the
strains
of
his
native
land
were
poured
on
his
ear
think
of
the
recollections
it
would
awaken
in
his
mind
how
painfully
thrilling
the
sensations
would
it
not
be
like
the
last
sweet
beam
of
a
hope
he
was
never
more
to
cherish
a
last
look
of
all
that
was
dear
on
earth
such
were
the
feelings
that
crept
unbidden
over
the
soul
of
the
enchanter
on
hearing
the
sweet
sounds
that
reminded
him
of
a
religion
he
had
for
ever
renounced
and
in
which
he
had
never
firmly
believed
till
he
had
believed
to
tremble
in
this
troubled
trance
he
sat
leaning
against
the
wall
until
the
worshippers
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
hymn
to
the
saviour
he
then
was
seized
with
strong
convulsions
and
rising
up
with
staggering
steps
he
fled
from
the
chamber
crying
as
he
went
cruel
and
improvident
things
reptiles
cursed
whining
sycophants
that
would
send
me
to
my
doom
before
my
time
he
rushed
out
to
the
battlements
and
groping
his
way
through
the
storm
took
shelter
in
the
narrow
staircase
that
he
might
hear
no
more
of
the
sounds
that
thus
troubled
and
distracted
his
soul
what
dread
had
seized
him
or
what
he
had
seen
or
heard
his
guests
knew
not
but
they
had
scarcely
well
ended
their
hymn
when
he
rushed
again
in
among
them
with
wildered
looks
and
his
hair
standing
on
end
seeming
glad
to
take
shelter
among
those
from
whom
he
had
so
lately
fled
with
abhorrence
no
one
enquired
the
cause
for
all
were
so
weary
and
overcome
with
slumber
and
every
one
then
composed
himself
to
sleep
in
the
manner
that
best
suited
his
convenience
the
storm
continued
to
rage
with
unabated
violence
and
after
they
had
laid
themselves
down
they
found
that
the
castle
was
all
tottering
and
quaking
before
it
the
firmest
heart
was
appalled
for
the
rocking
of
the
castle
was
not
all
every
now
and
then
they
heard
eldritch
shrieks
arising
as
of
some
wretch
perishing
or
rather
as
some
of
them
thought
like
the
voices
of
angry
spirits
yelling
through
the
tempest
when
one
of
these
howling
sounds
came
on
the
blast
every
one
of
our
prostrate
friends
breathed
a
deep
sigh
or
uttered
some
exclamatory
sound
charlie
had
always
one
which
he
uttered
even
after
he
was
asleep
hech
gude
sauf
us
sirs
what
will
be
the
upshot
o
a
this
the
master
sat
muffled
up
in
the
corner
close
behind
them
and
after
he
judged
them
all
to
be
asleep
he
fell
a
sort
of
hymn
in
an
under
key
the
poet
was
however
more
than
half
awake
and
gathered
up
some
broken
fragments
of
it
poets
are
never
to
trust
when
they
give
quotations
from
memory
out
of
the
works
of
others
and
perhaps
honest
carol
might
add
some
bombastic
lines
of
his
own
but
he
always
averred
that
the
following
lines
formed
a
part
of
the
warlock
hymn
pother
pother
my
master
and
brother
who
may
endure
thee
thus
failing
in
fury
king
of
the
tempest
that
travels
the
plain
king
of
the
snow
and
the
hail
and
the
rain
lend
to
thy
lever
yet
seven
times
seven
blow
up
the
blue
flame
for
bolt
and
for
levin
the
red
forge
of
hell
with
the
bellows
of
heaven
with
hoop
and
with
hammer
with
yell
and
with
yammer
hold
them
at
play
till
the
dawn
of
the
day
pother
pother
my
sovereign
and
brother
o
strain
to
thy
lever
this
world
to
sever
in
two
or
in
three
what
joy
it
would
be
what
toiling
and
moiling
and
mighty
commotions
what
rending
of
hills
and
what
roaring
of
oceans
ay
that
is
thy
voice
i
know
it
full
well
and
that
is
thy
whistle
majestic
swell
but
why
wilt
thou
ride
thy
furious
race
along
the
bounds
of
vacant
space
while
there
is
tongue
of
flesh
to
scream
and
life
to
start
and
blood
to
stream
yet
pother
pother
my
sovereign
and
brother
and
men
shall
see
ere
the
rising
sun
what
deeds
thy
mighty
arm
hath
done
if
it
was
true
that
the
master
sung
these
ridiculous
lines
which
is
not
very
likely
his
sovereign
and
brother
had
not
accepted
of
his
sacrifice
nor
paid
due
deference
to
his
incense
of
praise
for
a
little
before
the
break
of
day
our
group
were
aroused
from
their
profound
slumbers
by
loud
and
reiterated
cries
the
lamp
was
still
burning
feebly
and
blue
charlie
whose
ear
was
well
trained
to
catch
any
alarm
was
the
first
to
start
up
but
the
sight
that
he
saw
soon
laid
him
again
flat
on
the
floor
though
not
before
he
had
leaped
clear
over
a
narrow
and
two
forms
there
was
a
black
being
that
appeared
to
be
and
dragging
master
michael
scott
along
the
room
toward
the
door
yet
he
dragged
him
with
difficulty
and
at
some
times
the
wizard
seemed
rather
to
prevail
horrible
as
this
phantom
was
all
those
who
saw
it
agreed
that
there
was
something
about
it
that
instantly
reminded
them
of
the
late
seneschal
and
as
they
raised
their
heads
and
beheld
it
every
heart
was
chilled
with
terror
charlie
pronounced
his
short
loud
prayer
which
has
already
been
recorded
in
this
history
and
which
consisted
merely
of
one
vehement
sentence
of
three
syllables
yea
he
pronounced
it
as
he
flew
and
then
squatting
in
a
corner
and
covering
his
head
with
his
cloak
that
whatever
dreadful
thing
happened
he
might
not
see
it
there
he
lay
repeating
his
little
prayer
as
fast
as
human
breath
could
utter
it
the
demon
struggled
hard
with
the
master
and
the
latter
as
may
well
be
supposed
exerted
his
utmost
power
so
that
his
adversary
only
got
him
toward
the
door
as
it
were
by
inches
when
he
found
himself
losing
ground
he
always
made
a
certain
writhing
motion
which
can
not
be
described
and
which
every
time
extricated
him
somewhat
from
his
adversary
clutches
then
the
apparition
laid
hold
of
him
again
by
the
left
side
with
his
lobster
claws
and
that
gripe
uniformly
caused
the
wizard
to
utter
a
loud
and
piercing
cry
at
such
times
charlie
little
prayer
might
be
heard
waxing
still
louder
as
the
strife
increased
and
though
he
lifted
not
his
face
from
the
earth
he
continued
a
kind
of
spurning
motion
with
his
feet
as
if
he
would
fain
have
burrowed
under
the
wall
like
a
mole
for
a
long
time
no
one
durst
move
to
the
master
assistance
the
scene
so
far
surpassed
ought
they
had
ever
conceived
in
horror
that
their
senses
remained
altogether
benumbed
the
combat
continued
with
unabated
ardour
the
master
foamed
at
the
mouth
his
hair
stood
all
on
end
and
his
bloodshot
eyes
stared
wildly
as
if
they
would
have
started
from
their
sockets
at
length
the
fiend
so
far
prevailed
as
to
drag
the
master
close
to
the
door
where
he
threw
him
down
and
made
a
motion
as
if
he
would
have
dashed
him
through
below
it
but
michael
was
flesh
and
blood
and
could
not
enter
nor
depart
by
the
or
the
foot
of
the
door
like
the
beings
with
whom
he
had
to
do
the
demon
therefore
tried
to
open
the
door
but
the
enchanter
muscular
frame
being
jammed
against
it
it
could
not
be
opened
at
once
michael
efforts
were
now
directed
to
that
object
alone
namely
the
keeping
of
the
door
shut
and
he
exerted
himself
till
his
remaining
strength
was
exhausted
but
at
last
suffered
himself
to
be
dragged
back
from
the
door
repeating
these
words
as
he
lay
flat
on
his
back
is
done
is
done
is
over
is
over
the
lookers
on
sat
and
trembled
all
save
the
friar
who
had
by
that
time
somewhat
rallied
his
scattered
senses
and
stood
on
his
feet
the
fiend
had
dragged
the
master
back
from
the
door
by
the
feet
and
holding
him
down
by
the
grey
hair
with
one
hand
he
opened
the
door
with
the
other
then
stooping
down
he
twisted
the
one
hand
armed
with
red
crooked
claws
in
his
hair
and
the
other
in
his
long
grizzled
beard
the
friar
had
stepped
forward
and
at
that
moment
laying
the
rood
on
the
master
forehead
with
the
one
hand
and
the
open
book
of
the
gospels
on
his
breast
with
the
other
he
pronounced
a
sacred
name
and
in
that
name
commanded
the
demon
to
depart
swift
as
the
javelin
leaves
the
hand
of
the
warrior
or
the
winged
shaft
flies
from
the
bowstring
did
the
monster
fly
from
the
symbols
of
a
creed
by
which
he
and
his
confederate
powers
were
all
controlled
and
from
a
name
and
authority
at
which
the
depths
of
hell
trembled
he
rushed
out
at
the
door
with
a
yell
of
dismay
and
threw
himself
from
the
battlement
on
the
yielding
wind
the
friar
peeped
forth
after
him
but
he
only
heard
a
booming
sound
which
died
on
the
gale
and
beheld
like
a
dragon
of
blue
livid
fire
flying
toward
the
east
in
the
direction
of
the
hill
of
eildon
the
friar
returned
into
the
chamber
with
a
countenance
beaming
with
joy
no
conqueror
ever
returned
from
the
field
of
battle
with
an
exultation
of
mind
so
sublime
as
that
which
now
lighted
up
his
uncourtly
mien
his
victory
had
been
so
sudden
and
so
complete
that
all
present
were
astounded
at
the
greatness
and
extent
of
his
power
and
none
of
his
friends
doubted
that
his
might
was
as
far
above
that
of
their
host
as
the
sun
or
the
stars
are
above
the
earth
they
had
in
this
instance
seen
it
exemplified
in
a
manner
not
to
be
disputed
and
there
was
the
master
himself
still
sitting
on
the
floor
and
gazing
on
his
deliverer
with
astonishment
man
may
i
not
thank
thee
for
this
said
he
no
said
the
friar
think
not
of
a
poor
mortal
thing
like
me
overcome
with
sins
faults
and
follies
you
are
freed
for
this
time
but
thank
one
who
is
greater
than
i
true
i
am
freed
for
the
present
said
the
master
but
it
is
by
a
mode
and
by
a
power
that
i
dare
not
for
my
existence
acknowledge
or
acquiesce
in
when
charlie
heard
by
what
was
passing
that
the
devil
had
been
vanquished
and
was
fled
he
called
out
with
a
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
under
ground
for
he
was
so
muffled
up
in
his
cloak
that
the
sounds
could
scarcely
be
heard
friar
steek
the
door
the
good
man
obeyed
and
as
soon
as
charlie
heard
the
welcome
sound
he
raised
his
face
which
was
much
of
the
same
colour
as
a
living
lobster
and
standing
on
one
knee
viewed
all
the
faces
and
corners
with
that
eloquence
of
eye
which
is
quite
indescribable
how
superior
was
it

his
blunt
address

o

a
long
discussion
now
commenced
between
the
friar
and
the
master
on
the
principles
which
each
of
them
professed
that
colloquy
is
too
serious
and
too
tedious
to
be
copied
at
full
length
in
this
place
but
it
amounted
simply
to
this
that
the
one
considered
the
christian
revelation
as
the
source
of
all
that
is
good
wise
or
great
among
men
the
other
had
disbelieved
it
from
his
youth
upward
and
not
being
able
to
come
to
any
conclusion
from
ought
he
could
learn
among
men
he
had
besought
communion
with
the
potent
spirits
of
the
elements
and
after
seven
years
of
unparalleled
suffering
such
as
can
not
be
named
had
attained
what
he
sought
these
had
confirmed
him
in
his
infidelity
he
had
entered
into
a
league
with
them
renouncing
for
ever
and
ever
all
right
in
a
redeemer
and
signing
the
covenant
with
his
own
blood
that
afterwards
he
had
rejoiced
in
this
fellowship
which
had
enabled
him
to
do
deeds
such
as
no
other
man
could
perform
till
by
degrees
he
discovered
that
the
meanest
professor
of
the
religion
of
jesus
if
influenced
by
faith
and
sincerity
had
the
power
of
counteracting
these
mighty
spirits
and
of
frustrating
their
highest
intents
that
then
his
eyes
were
opened
when
it
was
too
late
and
he
only
believed
in
time
to
tremble
and
despair
the
friar
urged
the
inexhaustible
riches
of
heavenly
mercy
but
the
master
spurned
at
it
declaring
his
resolution
to
abide
by
his
covenant
whatever
his
fate
might
be
he
despised
the
very
name
and
nature
of
repentance
and
would
rather
suffer
with
the
colleagues
he
had
chosen
he
said
than
whine
and
cringe
to
another
master
though
i
now
feel
to
my
sorrow
that
they
are
subordinate
added
he
yet
are
they
mighty
and
powerful
beyond
what
thou
canst
comprehend
and
why
may
not
i
be
a
sharer
in
their
energies
in
a
future
existence
as
well
as
in
this
the
friar
gazed
and
trembled
when
he
heard
the
wild
and
erratic
ideas
of
this
extraordinary
man
and
ceasing
to
reason
further
with
him
he
enquired
how
it
came
that
some
of
these
mighty
associates
of
his
were
his
enemies
and
seemed
but
to
watch
an
opportunity
of
tearing
him
in
pieces
they
are
jealous
of
their
rights
and
capricious
beyond
all
conception
said
he
the
utmost
circumspection
is
not
fit
to
keep
on
fair
and
equal
terms
with
them
even
yet
i
do
not
know
but
that
this
is
to
be
my
last
night
here
if
i
have
gone
beyond
my
commission
in
the
orders
i
have
given
then
am
i
doomed
to
be
their
bond
slave
for
ages
but
if
i
am
within
my
limited
bounds
and
the
work
is
effected
then
shall
i
still
be
obeyed
for
a
time
and
a
season
would
that
it
were
morning
that
i
might
know
the
worst
scarcely
dost
thou
need
to
express
thy
wish
again
said
the
friar
for
lo
the
day
dawneth
in
the
east
and
the
shadows
flee
away
before
it
the
winds
have
gone
to
their
chambers
to
sleep
and
the
rains
are
over
and
gone
let
us
walk
forth
and
see
how
the
darkness
fadeth
before
the
face
of
the
day
and
all
that
is
stirring
abroad
on
the
fair
face
of
the
creation
the
master
did
not
move
for
it
was
yet
but
twilight
and
nothing
could
be
seen
distinctly
but
the
friar
stepped
down
to
the
battlements
and
charlie
who
looked
on
him
as
their
only
safeguard
followed
the
poet
would
doubtless
have
followed
also
to
have
seen
the
dawn
of
the
morning
after
a
storm
but
like
all
the
rhyming
race
to
this
day
he
was
enslaved
by
the
eyes
of
a
maid
languished
in
chains
and
could
not
move
but
as
she
moved
alas
for
the
poor
amorous
poet
the
others
lay
in
a
sluggish
and
restless
slumber
the
friar
and
the
bold
yeoman
strode
together
along
the
paved
way
and
looked
abroad
but
they
could
see
only
the
clouds
whitening
in
the
eastern
horizon
without
being
able
to
distinguish
wood
from
waste
or
land
from
water
let
us
kneel
down
and
pray
my
son
said
the
friar
even
in
this
quiet
place
where
we
shall
be
freed
from
the
interruptions
of
the
wicked
one
for
great
and
manifold
are
the
dangers
that
surround
us
i
see
not
what
remains
for
us
but
either
to
throw
ourselves
from
the
walls
and
perish
or
remain
where
we
are
and
feed
upon
one
another
it
is
an
awsome
eternitive
man
answered
charlie
i
sure
an
ye
think
praying
will
do
ony
good
i
shall
take
off
my
bonnet
and
kneel
down
on
my
knees
and
hearken
weel
but
what
mair
can
i
do
you
can
join
with
me
in
spirit
my
son
said
the
friar
and
pray
with
your
heart
i
am
sure
gin
i
but
kend
the
process
i
am
very
willing
said
charlie
with
that
he
took
off
his
steel
belted
bonnet
and
kneeled
reverendly
beside
the
friar
who
prayed
so
fervently
and
sublimely
for
deliverance
that
charlie
looked
about
every
minute
not
only
then
but
all
that
morning
to
see
by
what
means
they
were
to
be
delivered
for
he
had
no
doubt
but
they
would
be
set
free
to
a
certainty
and
that
in
a
very
short
time
when
they
arose
the
first
word
that
the
friar
said
was
the
following
fervent
exclamation
blessed
virgin
what
do
i
see
charlie
looked
all
about
for
some
approaching
miracle
he
had
even
some
hopes
of
seeing
a
detachment
from
the
warden
army
but
his
eye
ranged
the
dusky
fields
in
vain
what
a
strange
world
we
live
in
rejoined
the
friar
yea
surely
there
are
things
in
heaven
and
in
the
earth
and
in
the
waters
yea
many
things
of
which
man
knoweth
nothing
why
art
thou
gazing
abroad
on
all
nature
my
son
turn
thine
eyes
toward
the
east
and
tell
me
what
thou
seest
charlie
did
so
and
on
the
instant
the
two
friends
were
standing
fixed
in
amazement
like
two
statues
they
moved
not
save
now
and
then
to
steal
a
momentary
glance
at
each
other
the
great
mountain
of
eildon
was
actually
rent
in
pieces
from
the
top
to
its
very
foundations
and
piled
up
in
three
towering
spiral
mountains
as
they
remain
to
this
day
only
at
that
time
they
were
taller
darker
and
more
uniform
it
was
a
scene
of
wonder
not
to
be
understood
and
awfully
impressive
the
two
rivers
flowed
down
their
respective
vallies
and
met
below
the
castle
like
two
branching
seas
and
every
little
streamlet
roared
and
foamed
like
a
river
the
hills
had
a
wan
bleached
appearance
many
of
the
trees
of
the
forest
were
shivered
and
towering
up
against
the
eastern
sky
there
stood
the
three
romantic
hills
of
eildon
where
before
there
was
but
one
the
friar
was
the
first
to
move
from
his
trance
stepping
away
in
deep
meditation
charlie
was
by
this
time
likewise
released
from
the
spell
and
he
ran
to
the
door
of
the
high
chamber
calling
aloud
come
a
out
sirs
come
a
out
the
like
o
this
was
never
seen
sin
the
warld
stood
up
they
came
forth
accordingly
and
their
consternation
was
correspondent
to
the
extraordinary
event
but
when
the
master
came
out
and
saw
what
was
done
he
shouted
and
leaped
on
the
battlement
like
one
frantic
boasting
and
uttering
words
of
terrible
blasphemy
he
looked
on
the
mountain
of
and
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
when
he
beheld
it
standing
in
one
unskaithed
unbroken
cone
as
it
had
done
for
ages
he
looked
again
to
the
three
mountains
of
eildon
and
his
exultation
and
blasphemous
boasting
was
redoubled
so
all
that
you
and
your
master
can
effect
cried
he
is
to
throw
a
little
glamour
on
the
sight
is
to
practise
a
little
deception
i
never
weened
the
monkish
art
or
profession
to
consist
of
more
see
what
my
sovereign
and
master
can
do
hold
there
said
the
friar
who
was
it
that
made
these
mountains
at
the
first
was
that
deception
it
was
not
thou
said
the
master
but
who
was
it
then
that
sent
up
your
wicked
seneschal
into
the
stormy
clouds
in
a
flame
of
fire
added
the
friar
and
who
was
it
that
saved
your
life
but
this
morning
from
a
fiend
that
would
have
devoured
you
were
these
both
deceptions
the
master
countenance
fell
the
friar
said
this
because
in
their
present
perilous
situation
he
wished
to
keep
a
little
awe
over
the
wizard
and
likewise
to
put
a
stop
to
the
torrent
of
blasphemy
that
proceeded
from
his
lips
the
morning
advanced
the
sun
arose
but
no
assistance
no
relief
appeared
to
our
hapless
prisoners
they
had
tasted
nothing
for
a
day
and
night
save
one
cup
of
wine
each
and
they
had
not
above
as
much
more
remaining
for
all
this
the
master
was
so
much
elated
that
his
behaviour
was
rather
like
that
of
a
person
frantic
with
joy
than
that
of
one
shut
up
among
others
to
perish
of
hunger
his
companions
in
misfortune
noted
likewise
that
he
was
again
disposed
to
be
peremptory
and
tyrannical
with
them
and
they
dreaded
that
his
familiars
were
again
at
his
command
the
men
wrought
all
the
forenoon
endeavouring
to
break
up
the
iron
door
but
they
neither
had
mattocks
nor
room
to
work
in
and
they
made
no
more
impression
on
it
than
as
many
mice
would
have
done
they
were
now
quite
disconsolate
and
being
unable
to
do
aught
else
they
puzzled
themselves
in
accounting
for
the
late
steward
motives
for
having
locked
it
they
remembered
that
it
was
standing
wide
open
when
they
brought
him
up
a
prisoner
before
the
master
and
they
likewise
remembered
of
having
seen
him
step
into
that
stair
for
a
minute
or
two
immediately
before
he
began
to
brave
the
friar
therefore
all
that
they
could
guess
was
that
it
had
been
locked
with
some
fatal
intent
the
friar
perceiving
that
their
efforts
were
vain
entreated
them
to
come
in
from
the
open
air
and
keep
themselves
quiet
and
cheerful
that
they
might
wear
the
longer
he
trusted
in
heaven
he
said
that
they
would
be
delivered
but
in
the
mean
time
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
use
every
precaution
and
for
that
purpose
he
added
if
one
of
them
would
keep
watch
at
each
of
the
four
windows
lest
any
passengers
or
countrymen
should
come
near
he
would
tell
them
a
story
which
would
at
least
have
the
good
effect
of
keeping
them
quiet
the
master
was
quite
delighted
with
this
proposal
and
taking
the
flagon
of
wine
he
proposed
that
they
should
share
it
among
them
but
the
rest
opposed
it
and
contented
themselves
with
half
a
cup
each
charlie
was
most
of
all
cast
down
he
had
heard
a
word
from
the
friar
that
morning
that
sunk
deep
on
his
heart
it
was
something
about
eating
one
another
and
not
being
able
to
get
rid
of
the
thought
he
brought
it
again
overhead
the
rest
were
all
struck
dumb
for
they
perceived
that
it
was
but
too
apparent
it
might
come
to
that
the
master
grinned
darkly
and
said
it
was
well
but
gibbie
said
he
hoped
if
things
came
that
length
they
wad
draw
cuts
that
ilka
ane
might
get
a
fair
chance
for
his
life
the
poet
begged
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
out
of
respect
to
the
tender
sex
they
would
leave
delany
the
last
or
at
least
that
when
the
lot
fell
on
her
they
would
take
him
in
her
place
to
this
they
all
agreed
with
one
voice
but
an
extraordinary
thought
striking
on
the
master
mind
at
that
instant
he
made
a
motion
and
proposed
to
settle
it
off
hand
by
a
vote
this
maid
whom
you
term
beautiful
is
mine
on
one
condition
said
he
and
as
i
can
now
in
a
very
short
time
comply
with
that
condition
i
claim
her
as
my
own
i
will
therefore
give
her
to
the
man
among
you
who
tells
me
the
best
tale
she
shall
be
his
fully
and
freely
to
do
with
her
as
seemeth
him
good
and
the
man
among
you
who
tells
the
worst
shall
if
need
require
it
be
blooded
and
flayed
in
this
same
chamber
for
food
to
his
associates
charlie
blood
ran
cold
within
him
at
this
proposal
he
almost
thought
he
felt
the
flaying
knife
and
the
teeth
of
the
ravenous
eaters
and
when
the
master
called
out
approve
or
not
approve
charlie
was
the
first
to
call
out
o
not
not
not
he
was
seconded
by
tam
craik
but
all
the
rest
voted
on
the
other
side
so
that
they
were
left
in
the
minority
and
the
matter
was
finally
decided
to
be
precisely
as
the
master
had
proposed
the
poet
stretched
himself
so
eager
was
he
to
begin
for
his
heart
yearned
within
him
to
win
the
beautiful
delany
gibbie
was
also
uplifted
and
sure
of
victory
but
tam
and
charlie
were
both
quite
hopeless
and
cast
down
chapter
and
i
said
unto
him
thou
tell
unto
thy
servant
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
the
friar
having
volunteered
a
tale
the
priority
was
unanimously
awarded
to
him
so
after
the
watches
were
set
and
all
quiet
he
began
the
following
singular
narrative
without
further
ceremony
the
friar
tale
chapter
i
in
the
days
of
the
years
of
my
pilgrimage
it
chanced
to
me
that
i
sojourned
in
the
great
kingdom
that
is
toward
the
south
and
i
passed
through
the
city
that
lieth
on
the
river
of
the
hills
unto
the
house
of
galli
the
scribe
who
was
a
good
man
and
a
just
and
he
had
one
only
daughter
who
was
unto
him
as
a
treasure
and
an
heritage
for
her
mother
had
been
led
unto
her
people
before
the
maid
could
distinguish
between
her
right
hand
and
her
left
and
the
maiden
was
fair
to
look
upon
for
her
neck
was
as
polished
ivory
and
her
chin
like
the
ripened
peach
basking
on
a
wall
that
looketh
toward
the
south
her
lips
also
were
like
the
her
teeth
were
rows
of
pearl
and
her
breath
was
as
sweet
smelling
incense
and
myrrh
and
cassia
her
eyes
were
brighter
than
the
dew
of
heaven
and
her
hair
was
like
the
beams
of
the
moon
streaming
through
the
white
clouds
that
are
in
the
firmament
of
air
and
i
loved
the
maiden
exceedingly
and
my
heart
burned
within
me
and
i
became
as
a
dead
man
and
i
wist
not
what
to
do
or
what
would
become
of
me
for
the
vows
of
the
lord
were
on
me
that
i
could
not
wed
and
i
said
woe
is
me
for
i
am
undone
and
i
went
in
unto
her
and
communed
with
her
of
my
great
love
and
when
she
had
hearkened
to
my
voice
she
laughed
me
to
scorn
and
i
said
why
dost
thou
laugh
me
to
scorn
knowest
thou
not
that
i
would
lay
down
my
life
for
thee
for
i
love
thee
so
much
above
all
things
that
are
on
the
earth
that
i
would
even
lick
the
dust
from
off
thy
feet
and
she
said
what
wouldst
thou
have
me
to
do
and
i
looked
on
my
right
hand
and
on
my
left
and
i
communed
with
my
heart
and
i
perceived
that
the
maid
had
asked
aright
for
i
knew
not
what
i
would
have
her
to
do
and
lo
my
countenance
became
abashed
and
she
laughed
at
me
exceedingly
yea
she
laughed
at
my
calamity
till
the
tears
streamed
from
her
eyes
i
said
therefore
unto
myself
that
i
would
die
and
be
gathered
unto
my
fathers
for
how
could
i
live
to
be
a
scorn
and
a
derision
and
to
be
burnt
up
as
with
a
devouring
flame
and
i
had
many
thoughts
of
unrighteousness
dwelling
in
me
and
she
told
her
father
of
these
matters
and
galli
the
scribe
was
wroth
with
me
and
said
unto
me
why
wouldst
thou
betray
my
daughter
the
child
of
my
age
and
the
hope
of
my
grey
hairs
is
it
not
better
for
thee
to
depart
unto
thine
own
country
and
to
thy
kindred
than
commit
this
great
wickedness
and
my
spirit
was
grieved
within
me
nevertheless
i
could
not
depart
for
my
heart
clove
to
the
maid
and
i
loved
her
as
my
own
soul
chapter
ii
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
army
of
the
prince
of
the
land
encamped
in
that
place
for
he
was
a
great
prince
and
had
increased
his
army
and
he
had
captains
over
hundreds
and
captains
over
fifties
and
captains
over
tens
and
these
were
clothed
in
gorgeous
apparel
in
brocade
of
gold
and
in
brocade
of
silver
and
they
were
vain
men
for
they
had
the
plumage
of
birds
upon
their
heads
and
gems
of
silver
and
of
gold
and
of
precious
stones
on
their
breasts
and
swords
girded
on
their
thighs
and
the
damsel
beheld
them
and
her
heart
danced
with
joy
yea
her
eyes
followed
them
whithersoever
they
went
and
i
was
more
grieved
than
ever
therefore
i
counselled
her
and
said
all
manner
of
evil
of
the
men
but
she
would
not
hearken
to
my
reproof
but
cast
all
my
counsel
behind
her
back
and
she
derided
me
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
process
of
time
that
one
of
the
captains
of
fifty
came
to
her
and
spoke
kind
words
unto
her
even
great
swelling
words
of
vanity
and
she
hearkened
unto
him
and
her
ears
drunk
in
his
burning
speeches
even
as
the
ox
drinketh
in
water
and
she
delighted
therein
and
he
looked
into
her
eye
and
behold
he
saw
his
own
image
impressed
in
it
as
in
a
glass
and
he
looked
into
it
many
times
and
it
grew
brighter
and
every
time
that
he
looked
into
it
he
saw
his
own
image
the
more
deeply
and
strongly
reflected
until
he
knew
that
he
lived
in
her
heart
but
her
image
was
not
in
his
eye
and
i
knew
this
and
was
grieved
therefore
i
withstood
him
to
his
face
and
rebuked
him
yea
and
i
also
cursed
him
but
the
captain
of
fifty
mocked
me
he
also
told
the
maid
and
she
became
wroth
with
me
so
that
the
two
being
combined
against
me
i
could
do
nothing
but
sit
down
and
weep
and
she
gave
unto
him
all
that
she
had
yea
she
gave
him
until
she
had
no
more
to
give
for
she
gave
unto
him
herself
and
her
countenance
was
changed
her
bright
eyes
retained
not
their
wonted
brightness
her
voice
was
broken
and
her
tongue
faltered
in
her
mouth
but
the
captain
of
fifty
regarded
it
not
for
he
left
her
and
went
his
way
and
he
did
eat
and
drink
and
made
himself
merry
with
wine
and
he
said
what
is
a
maiden
that
i
should
regard
her
or
for
what
were
the
daughters
of
women
formed
but
for
my
pleasure
and
the
prince
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
land
sent
unto
his
army
that
they
should
go
into
a
far
country
to
fight
against
the
enemies
of
their
lord
the
king
and
the
men
purposed
to
go
and
the
captain
of
fifty
purposed
to
go
also
and
when
the
maiden
heard
of
it
her
heart
failed
within
her
and
she
fell
sick
and
i
feared
it
would
be
to
death
and
i
tried
to
comfort
her
and
i
watched
with
her
day
and
night
and
prayed
many
prayers
for
her
but
she
became
worse
for
her
spirit
was
wounded
and
cast
down
and
galli
the
scribe
was
also
sorely
afflicted
and
he
mourned
exceedingly
saying
alas
what
shall
i
do
for
my
daughter
she
who
was
the
hope
of
my
age
and
my
only
comfort
here
below
wo
is
me
for
she
is
dying
of
a
lingering
disease
and
i
shall
be
left
childless
now
galli
the
scribe
knew
not
what
the
captain
of
fifty
had
done
unto
her
nor
of
all
that
she
had
given
unto
him
so
i
went
forth
unto
the
host
to
seek
this
betrayer
of
women
and
to
speak
peaceably
with
him
and
to
reason
with
him
but
he
knew
me
afar
off
and
said
to
his
brethren
lo
here
cometh
that
man
of
a
strange
country
let
us
make
him
our
sport
and
they
combined
against
me
and
treated
me
with
great
indignity
for
they
bound
my
hands
and
put
me
into
the
river
and
the
flood
carried
me
away
so
that
i
said
in
mine
heart
lo
i
shall
be
drowned
for
there
is
not
one
to
pity
or
save
me
but
they
took
me
forth
before
my
breath
departed
clean
away
and
they
stripped
me
naked
and
tied
me
to
a
stake
and
scourged
me
and
afterwards
they
stoned
me
out
of
the
camp
and
i
was
very
wroth
and
went
unto
the
captain
of
the
host
and
made
my
complaint
known
unto
him
and
i
said
o
my
lord
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
thy
servant
behold
one
of
your
captains
of
fifty
came
unto
the
house
of
galli
the
scribe
and
the
man
intreated
him
kindly
yet
hath
he
betrayed
his
daughter
and
refuseth
to
do
her
justice
and
the
maid
will
die
and
her
father
who
is
a
good
man
will
go
down
to
the
grave
with
her
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
me
what
have
i
to
do
with
this
matter
or
with
thee
as
a
maid
treadeth
the
wine
press
so
let
her
drink
it
is
not
meet
that
i
should
be
troubled
with
these
things
and
i
went
away
and
wept
bitterly
for
i
could
find
neither
consolation
nor
redress
and
i
saw
that
the
wickedness
of
the
men
was
very
great
then
i
went
and
trimmed
my
beard
and
borrowed
me
a
suit
of
armour
and
i
put
an
helmet
of
steel
upon
mine
head
and
a
upon
my
breast
and
i
girded
on
a
sword
and
i
went
forth
and
challenged
the
captain
of
fifty
to
fight
with
me
and
i
said
in
mine
heart
lo
i
will
fight
this
wicked
man
and
overcome
him
and
i
will
take
his
sword
from
him
and
rend
his
armour
from
off
his
loins
and
then
will
i
compel
him
to
do
justice
to
those
whom
he
hath
wronged
else
will
i
smite
off
his
head
and
we
met
by
the
side
of
the
river
and
he
discerned
me
not
through
my
disguise
for
he
said
unto
me
who
art
thou
or
what
have
i
to
say
to
thee
and
i
said
for
the
wrong
that
thou
hast
done
to
the
house
of
galli
the
scribe
have
i
called
thee
out
to
battle
and
he
said
thou
hast
done
well
i
will
chastise
thee
as
thou
deservest
that
thou
mayest
learn
how
to
lift
up
thy
hand
against
the
servants
of
our
lord
the
king
so
we
fought
and
his
hand
was
sore
against
me
for
he
drove
me
out
of
my
place
and
wounded
me
and
my
hope
had
nearly
perished
but
i
prayed
to
the
lord
for
strength
and
we
fought
again
and
the
combat
was
very
sore
that
day
and
he
prevailed
not
against
me
and
after
the
combat
had
lasted
until
my
breath
was
spent
and
my
arm
weary
by
the
help
of
the
lord
i
wounded
him
in
the
loins
so
that
my
sword
found
a
passage
through
his
body
and
he
fell
and
i
was
sore
afraid
and
fled
away
and
hid
myself
for
i
trembled
at
the
thing
i
had
done
because
i
perceived
that
the
last
case
was
worse
than
the
first
and
when
the
soldiers
came
to
him
he
said
that
galli
the
scribe
had
sent
out
ruffians
to
slay
him
and
when
these
things
were
told
to
the
captain
of
the
host
he
was
exceedingly
wroth
and
he
sent
forth
men
to
destroy
the
house
of
galli
the
scribe
and
to
slay
him
and
take
his
substance
for
a
prey
and
the
captain
of
fifty
died
that
night
and
they
buried
him
with
great
lamentation
for
they
wept
over
him
saying
alas
our
brother
for
he
hath
been
cut
off
before
his
time
chapter
iii
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
i
had
laid
aside
my
armour
and
put
on
my
pilgrim
weeds
that
i
went
forth
into
the
plain
and
into
the
city
and
when
i
heard
the
words
of
the
captain
of
the
host
and
the
command
that
he
had
given
i
hasted
to
the
house
of
galli
the
scribe
and
said
unto
him
go
to
put
up
all
thy
money
and
thy
jewels
and
fly
for
thy
life
for
behold
evil
is
determined
concerning
thee
but
he
would
not
hearken
to
my
voice
for
he
said
i
have
done
no
man
wrong
and
i
intreated
him
but
prevailed
not
therefore
i
went
unto
his
daughter
and
told
her
of
what
i
had
heard
and
i
said
rise
up
make
haste
and
escape
for
the
soldiers
will
abuse
thee
and
she
was
afraid
and
said
unto
me
take
me
and
hide
me
for
a
short
time
for
thy
words
have
never
deceived
me
and
i
hid
her
in
a
palm
tree
and
remained
with
her
and
the
men
who
belonged
to
the
captain
of
fifty
even
to
him
whom
i
slew
in
battle
came
as
they
were
commanded
and
they
entered
into
the
possessions
of
galli
the
scribe
and
they
took
all
that
he
had
for
a
prey
and
burned
his
house
with
fire
and
we
beheld
all
from
our
and
were
greatly
astonished
for
we
saw
galli
the
scribe
flying
through
the
garden
and
the
soldiers
pursuing
hard
after
him
with
their
swords
drawn
and
when
his
daughter
saw
it
she
shrieked
and
fainted
away
and
when
the
men
heard
her
voice
they
looked
about
and
some
of
them
ran
into
the
arbour
but
they
found
her
not
therefore
they
pursued
after
galli
the
scribe
and
i
trembled
sore
for
i
knew
not
if
we
were
discovered
neither
could
i
support
the
maiden
in
her
seat
for
she
beheld
whose
men
they
were
that
pursued
after
her
father
to
slay
him
and
she
deemed
that
her
captain
of
fifty
had
sent
out
his
fifty
to
devour
them
yea
to
destroy
and
to
slay
and
to
ravage
and
there
was
no
more
spirit
in
her
and
i
prayed
to
the
lord
my
god
out
from
among
the
branches
of
the
palm
tree
and
he
heard
my
voice
for
the
spoilers
came
and
they
sought
but
they
found
us
not
for
their
eyes
were
blinded
that
they
could
not
see
we
beheld
their
eyes
and
heard
the
threatenings
that
proceeded
out
of
their
mouths
yet
could
they
not
perceive
us
and
their
threatenings
were
filled
with
the
abominations
of
iniquity
for
the
men
were
very
wicked
and
i
took
her
out
of
the
palm
tree
by
night
and
i
covered
her
with
my
gown
and
we
tried
to
fly
and
make
our
escape
but
she
could
not
therefore
my
distress
was
very
great
and
i
carried
her
to
the
house
of
a
poor
widow
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
and
i
concealed
her
there
till
her
strength
should
recover
and
i
went
about
making
many
inquiries
and
i
heard
that
the
soldiers
had
taken
galli
the
scribe
and
had
given
him
up
to
be
persecuted
and
tormented
and
slain
also
that
the
whole
army
were
abroad
searching
to
recover
his
daughter
to
execute
vengeance
on
her
and
i
was
grieved
for
that
i
had
done
and
for
bringing
evil
on
those
i
loved
for
i
knew
that
the
men
of
the
host
spoiled
the
people
and
did
according
to
their
will
so
i
borrowed
me
a
pilgrim
robes
and
in
these
i
equipped
the
maiden
and
when
she
was
clothed
in
her
flowing
gown
with
her
cross
scallop
and
shell
behold
i
myself
could
not
discern
her
and
we
escaped
from
the
city
by
night
and
journeyed
toward
the
north
and
at
break
of
day
we
came
to
the
fords
of
the
great
river
where
we
were
encountered
by
three
of
the
soldiers
of
the
guard
who
waylaid
us
and
i
said
unto
them
whom
seek
ye
and
they
said
we
be
sent
out
to
seek
the
daughter
of
galli
the
scribe
for
she
hath
betrayed
one
of
the
captains
into
her
nets
and
hath
robbed
him
and
also
caused
him
to
be
cut
off
from
his
men
therefore
are
we
sent
out
to
take
her
that
she
may
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
his
men
that
they
may
do
to
her
as
seemeth
good
in
their
eyes
and
the
maiden
trembled
so
that
the
men
beheld
it
and
i
turned
and
said
unto
her
said
i
not
that
it
was
so
and
i
said
furthermore
sit
thee
down
my
brother
until
we
converse
with
these
men
for
they
are
good
men
and
filled
with
wisdom
and
lo
have
not
i
strange
things
to
relate
unto
them
and
the
men
sat
down
and
we
sat
down
beside
them
and
i
said
we
are
pilgrims
and
strangers
and
come
from
a
far
country
and
they
said
peace
be
unto
you
and
i
said
moreover
that
it
was
given
unto
me
to
dream
dreams
and
to
see
visions
and
that
i
had
a
vision
of
my
head
upon
my
bed
which
was
of
this
galli
the
scribe
of
whom
they
spake
for
i
saw
and
beheld
that
he
had
put
forth
his
hand
on
a
captain
of
the
servants
of
my
lord
the
king
and
had
sent
forth
his
bravadoes
who
had
wounded
him
until
the
sword
passed
through
him
even
from
the
left
side
unto
the
right
and
the
men
said
is
not
this
wonderful
and
behold
i
saw
the
servants
of
my
lord
the
king
enter
the
dwelling
of
the
man
even
of
the
scribe
and
take
his
goods
and
him
they
pursued
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
took
by
the
vineyard
as
thou
goest
down
towards
a
river
and
they
burned
his
house
with
fire
so
that
the
flames
ascended
up
on
high
and
his
daughter
who
was
sick
and
concealed
in
an
inner
chamber
her
also
did
they
burn
until
she
was
quite
consumed
and
the
men
wondered
exceedingly
and
they
bowed
down
their
heads
and
said
thou
hast
told
unto
us
strange
things
it
is
even
as
thou
hast
said
go
on
your
way
and
i
blessed
them
and
they
returned
to
tell
unto
their
captains
the
wonderful
things
which
they
had
heard
and
i
fled
with
the
damsel
until
i
came
to
the
sea
and
when
we
had
found
a
ship
we
went
into
it
and
i
brought
her
to
my
own
country
but
not
to
my
kindred
for
i
placed
her
in
the
holy
isle
near
the
river
of
the
north
and
she
mourned
night
and
day
for
her
father
and
also
for
the
captain
of
fifty
whom
she
called
her
husband
for
she
dreaded
that
some
evil
had
befallen
unto
him
for
on
the
day
that
he
had
sworn
to
her
he
had
given
her
a
graven
image
which
she
kept
hid
in
her
bosom
and
she
wept
over
it
and
kissed
it
and
i
was
grieved
and
rebuked
her
but
she
refused
to
be
comforted
and
i
went
and
came
and
brought
her
of
the
good
things
of
the
land
for
i
loved
her
as
the
breath
of
my
nostrils
and
when
the
days
of
her
months
were
fulfilled
behold
she
brought
forth
a
daughter
and
the
babe
was
also
beautiful
to
look
upon
and
the
bosom
of
the
mother
yearned
over
her
child
and
she
called
her
by
her
father
name
even
by
the
name
of
the
captain
of
fifty
and
she
kissed
her
child
and
wept
over
it
day
and
night
but
the
frame
and
substance
of
her
body
were
wasted
away
with
perpetual
grief
and
i
saw
that
the
child
would
die
and
when
i
saw
the
countenance
that
was
once
beautiful
as
the
morning
bathed
in
tears
as
her
babe
lay
at
a
breast
in
which
there
was
no
nourishment
i
was
exceedingly
sorry
even
unto
death
and
lo
i
took
the
child
and
nourished
it
yea
i
fed
it
with
bread
and
with
wine
with
butter
also
and
with
honey
and
milk
from
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
child
was
restored
but
the
mother
decayed
like
a
flower
that
is
cut
down
for
the
winds
of
grief
had
passed
over
her
and
her
spirit
was
consumed
the
summer
came
and
all
the
herbs
of
the
field
were
renewed
but
the
fairest
flower
of
the
land
was
bending
down
to
meet
the
clay
chapter
iv
and
it
came
also
to
pass
that
as
soon
as
i
found
myself
in
a
land
of
safety
i
wrote
many
letters
to
galli
the
scribe
for
i
said
peradventure
he
may
escape
out
of
their
hands
i
wrote
also
to
the
chief
of
our
order
giving
account
of
the
whole
matter
and
attesting
the
innocence
of
galli
the
scribe
but
no
answer
came
to
me
therefore
was
i
sore
distressed
for
i
said
if
the
mother
and
babe
both
perish
what
shall
become
of
me
and
one
day
as
i
sat
with
the
babe
on
my
knee
i
beheld
and
lo
the
eyes
of
the
mother
were
fixed
mournfully
on
her
babe
and
she
lifted
them
to
my
face
and
looked
at
her
babe
again
and
i
could
not
contain
myself
so
i
lifted
up
my
voice
and
wept
bitterly
but
she
smiled
and
said
wherefore
shouldst
thou
weep
behold
am
not
i
in
the
hand
of
the
lord
and
my
child
the
daughter
of
my
youth
and
of
my
love
thou
also
art
in
the
hands
of
thy
maker
may
he
lead
thee
and
guide
thee
and
keep
thee
from
the
snares
in
which
thy
mother
hath
fallen
though
thou
hast
lost
thy
father
as
i
also
have
lost
mine
yet
hast
thou
a
father
in
heaven
who
will
not
forsake
thee
neither
shalt
thou
altogether
lack
a
father
care
here
below
and
she
said
to
me
is
it
not
even
so
and
i
could
not
answer
her
for
i
wept
aloud
yea
i
even
wept
until
the
child
grew
affrighted
and
wept
also
and
the
mother
took
the
graven
image
from
her
neck
and
from
her
bosom
and
she
kissed
it
and
hung
it
round
the
neck
of
her
babe
and
she
said
it
is
the
image
and
likeness
of
thy
father
wear
it
my
child
till
the
day
of
thy
death
peradventure
thou
mayest
fall
among
his
people
and
among
his
kindred
for
they
were
men
of
honour
and
renown
and
she
kissed
her
child
and
said
now
shall
i
be
taken
from
thee
and
go
to
my
grave
and
they
will
bury
me
my
babe
among
strangers
and
there
is
none
of
my
people
to
shed
a
tear
over
me
and
we
all
wept
abundantly
and
shed
many
tears
and
while
we
yet
cried
aloud
lifting
up
our
voices
behold
one
entered
in
and
said
peace
be
with
you
and
i
discerned
him
not
for
mine
eyes
flowed
like
two
fountains
of
water
but
the
woman
cried
out
and
sprang
from
her
couch
and
she
clasped
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
said
my
father
my
father
and
behold
it
was
galli
the
scribe
and
the
woman
said
now
hath
my
child
found
a
father
indeed
and
she
said
blessed
and
happy
mayest
thou
be
my
daughter
for
i
bring
thee
joyful
tidings
and
blessed
be
this
man
who
hath
befriended
and
saved
thee
his
intercession
hath
also
saved
the
life
of
thy
father
all
that
was
mine
hath
been
restored
to
me
yea
and
more
also
and
i
will
give
all
unto
thee
and
to
thy
child
after
thee
and
thou
shalt
have
riches
and
honours
in
thy
own
country
and
among
thy
own
people
but
his
daughter
answered
him
not
for
the
words
died
on
her
tongue
but
she
looked
in
his
face
and
smiled
and
then
she
looked
at
her
babe
as
it
lay
on
my
knee
and
galli
the
scribe
was
sore
amazed
and
said
what
aileth
thee
my
daughter
and
why
answerest
thou
not
to
the
words
of
thy
father
and
he
held
her
in
his
arms
and
her
hands
were
clasped
around
his
neck
that
they
would
not
be
loosed
and
behold
there
was
a
sound
like
a
small
voice
issued
from
her
mouth
and
the
light
of
her
eyes
became
dim
and
her
head
fell
back
over
the
arm
of
her
father
and
her
gentle
spirit
departed
away
unto
him
that
gave
it
for
she
spoke
no
more
neither
breathed
she
any
more
and
we
buried
her
in
the
isle
of
the
holy
place
and
mourned
for
her
many
days
and
i
besought
of
galli
the
scribe
that
he
would
leave
the
child
with
me
that
i
might
bring
her
up
in
our
convent
and
breed
her
in
the
ways
of
purity
and
truth
but
he
refused
and
said
i
can
not
part
with
the
child
of
my
only
daughter
she
shall
go
with
me
and
be
the
heiress
of
all
that
i
possess
and
after
i
had
blessed
him
he
departed
with
the
little
maid
to
go
to
his
own
land
and
i
saw
them
no
more
for
after
many
years
had
elapsed
i
went
again
into
the
country
beyond
the
river
and
i
visited
the
house
of
galli
the
scribe
but
behold
he
had
never
returned
to
that
place
and
the
people
of
the
land
reported
unto
me
that
he
fell
among
thieves
and
was
slain
and
the
babe
was
slain
with
him
or
led
into
captivity
the
ways
of
heaven
are
unsearchable
and
the
hand
of
man
often
worketh
out
its
decrees
but
for
the
misfortunes
that
befel
the
house
of
galli
the
scribe
will
i
go
mourning
till
the
day
of
my
death

it
has
made
my
heart
very
sair
that
tale

charlie
i
wish
you
hadna
tauld
it
i
think
it
is
nae
tale
ata
said
tam
craik
if
i
coudna
hae
tauld
a
better
tale
than
that
i

and
what
for
should
he
no
he
make
the
best
mart
amang
us
i
differ
widely
from
you
said
the
poet
with
regard
to
the
merits
of
the
tale
i
love
the
friar
for
telling
it
and
i
love
him
ten
times
better
for
the
part
he
took
in
the
transaction
how
i
do
admire
the
love
that
has
no
selfish
flaw
no
moiety
of
sense
to
prompt
its
aberrations
should
i
ever
get
free
from
this
vile
pinnacle
this
grave
in
altitude
i
search
the
world
for
that
dear
child
and
find
her
too
if
in
the
world
she
be
alas
i
have
searched
and
searched
in
vain
answered
the
friar
it
was
so
long
before
i
knew
of
the
mishap
of
my
friend
and
my
darling
child
that
all
memory
of
the
transaction
was
lost
i
would
travel
from
sea
to
sea
and
from
the
river
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
find
out
that
dear
that
beloved
maiden
and
could
i
find
her
i
would
yet
put
her
in
possession
of
the
inheritance
of
her
father
for
i
have
instructed
the
heads
of
our
order
and
they
are
preserving
it
in
their
own
hands
as
the
patrimony
of
the
orphan
and
the
during
the
time
of
the
friar
narrative
delany
had
been
sitting
close
by
his
knee
in
fixed
and
earnest
attention
and
at
this
time
there
chancing
to
be
a
pause
in
the
conversation
she
looked
wistfully
about
as
if
afraid
she
was
going
to
commit
herself
by
telling
a
lie
but
there
was
such
a
beam
of
intelligence
playing
over
her
lovely
countenance
that
all
the
party
fixed
their
eyes
on
her
as
if
watching
with
the
deepest
interest
what
she
was
going
to
say
i
have
a
confused
dream
of
having
heard
something
of
this
story
before
said
she
but
subsequent
events
had
quite
obliterated
the
traces
of
it
from
my
memory
till
this
narrative
renewed
them
i
think
i
can
give
you
some
intelligence
of
this
lost
maiden
you
said
she
was
called
by
her
father
name
do
you
recollect
what
that
father
of
was
called
ay
that
will
i
never
forget
while
memory
retains
her
seat
in
this
repentant
bosom
said
the
friar
his
name
was
captain
jacques
the
very
same
said
the
maid
then
do
you
know
ought
of
this
or
did
you
ever
see
it
before
and
she
took
a
small
miniature
from
her
bosom
holding
it
near
to
the
friar
eye
by
the
blessed
stars
of
heaven
and
the
holy
virgin
that
rules
above
them
exclaimed
the
friar
it
is
the
graven
image
of
the
captain
of
fifty
whom
i
slew
in
battle
i
saw
it
placed
in
thy
bosom
yea
i
held
thee
on
my
knee
till
that
chain
of
gold
was
locked
about
thy
neck
never
to
be
removed
thou
art
indeed
the
daughter
of
the
fairest
and
the
comeliest
among
women
of
her
whom
i
loved
far
above
my
own
life
and
for
whom
i
travailled
in
pain
yea
thou
art
the
child
that
i
nursed
and
held
on
my
knee
and
all
the
inheritance
of
thy
fathers
is
thine
blessed
be
thou
my
daughter
and
blessed
be
they
who
have
preserved
thee
come
to
my
bosom
my
child
my
beloved
my
fair
one
that
i
may
fall
on
thy
neck
and
bless
thee
and
weep
over
thee
for
my
soul
rejoiceth
that
i
have
found
thee
the
poet
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
threw
himself
at
the
feet
and
embraced
them
and
wept
aloud
charlie
was
busied
in
drawing
pictures
of
swords
and
on
the
floor
with
the
brazen
end
of
his
sheathe
and
always
giving
a
loud
sob
as
if
his
heart
would
burst
even
master
michael
scott
once
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
eyes
though
no
one
believed
it
was
ought
of
sympathy
that
affected
him
the
abbreviation
of
the
name
was
so
natural
in
the
mouths
of
the
people
of
this
land
said
the
friar
that
i
wonder
i
should
never
have
recognised
it
nor
yet
on
the
face
of
my
dear
child
the
features
of
her
mother
hard
has
been
thy
lot
and
the
lot
of
thy
fathers
but
blessings
may
yet
remain
in
store
for
thee
i
dinna
see
where
they
to
come
frae
said
charlie
sighing
louder
than
ever
it
wad
be
the
hardest
thing
i
ever
kend
if
ane
sae
young
sae
bonnie
and
sae
good
after
a
that
she
has
borne
should
be
prickit
up
atween
the
yird
and
the
heaven
here
to
be
hungered
to
dead
and
then
eaten
wi
the
corbies
life
sweet
to
us
a
said
gibbie
she
wad
be
as
little
missed
as
ony
that
here
if
she
be
starved
to
death
wi
hunger
she
shall
be
starved
to
death
wi
hunger
cried
charlie
in
a
tone
of
valiant
desperation
na
na
afore
she
die
o
hunger
after
she
has
come
through
i
rather
cut
a
limb
off
my
ain
body
and
feed
her
an
corbie
be
spared
i
can
ride
by
the
warden
side
a
timmer
ane
god
bless
you
for
a
kind
heart
cried
the
poet
gin
i
thought
i
were
to
win
her
mysel
said
tam
and
win
away
life
out
o
this
luckless
place
i
wad
do
a
good
deal
for
her
but
if
i
trowed
ony
o
you
were
to
get
her
frae
me
i
no
tell
you
how
i
feel
just
as
a
hungry
man
should
feel
said
gibbie
and
as
ane
wha
has
starvation
afore
his
een
maun
feel
it
is
a
sair
trial
and
often
brings
me
o
the
story
of
marion
gib
callant
master
michael
scott
thinking
that
in
right
of
seniority
the
laird
was
now
about
to
begin
his
trial
story
for
life
or
death
made
a
signal
with
his
hand
for
his
guests
to
compose
themselves
which
they
did
with
one
consent
while
gibbie
pleased
with
the
mark
of
deference
shown
to
him
went
on
laird
of
peatstacknowe
tale
there
wad
aiblins
nane
o
you
ken
marion
she
lived
i
the
and
had
a
callant
to
the
lang
piper
him
that
squire
ridley
man
beat
at
the
meeting
weel
you
see
he
was
a
gilliegaupy
of
a
callant
gayan
like
the
dad
o
him
for
marion
said
he
wad
hae
eaten
a
horse
ahint
the
saddle
and
as
her
shieling
wasna
unco
weel
stored
meat
she
had
ill
getting
him
mainteened
till
at
the
lang
and
the
last
it
just
came
to
this
pass
that
whenever
jock
was
i
the
house
it
was
a
constant
battle
atween
marion
and
him
jock
fought
to
be
at
meat
and
marion
to
keep
him
frae
it
and
mony
hard
clouts
and
claws
there
past
they
wad
hae
foughten
about
a
haggis
or
a
new
kirning
o
butter
for
a
hale
hour
and
the
battle
generally
endit
in
jock
getting
a
or
a
good
shareo
ilka
thing
i
wish
we
had
sic
things
here
even
though
we
had
to
fight
for
them
when
he
had
fairly
gained
the
possession
by
whatever
means
he
feasted
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
licking
his
large
ruddy
lips
and
looking
all
about
him
with
eyes
of
the
utmost
benevolence
marion
railed
all
the
while
that
the
poor
lad
was
enjoying
himself
without
any
mercy
and
restraint
and
there
wasna
a
vile
name
under
the
sun
that
had
ony
signification
of
a
glutton
in
it
that
she
didna
ca
him
by
jock
took
the
bite
wi
the
buffet
he
heard
a
the
ill
names
and
munched
away
oh
how
his
heart
did
rejoice
a
fat
lunch
o
beef
a
good
haggis
or
even
a
cog
o
milk
brose
poor
fellow
such
things
were
his
joy
and
delight
so
he
snapped
them
up
and
in
two
or
three
hours
after
he
was
as
ready
for
another
battle
as
ever
this
was
a
terrible
life
to
lead
times
grew
aye
the
langer
the
waur
and
marion
was
obliged
to
hire
poor
jock
to
goodman
niddery
to
herd
his
kye
and
his
pet
sheep
jock
had
nae
thoughts
at
a
o
ganging
to
sic
a
job
at
first
but
marion
tauld
him
ilka
day
o
the
fat
beef
the
huge
kebbucks
and
the
parridge
sae
thick
that
a
wadna
delve
into
them
till
he
grew
impatient
for
the
term
day
that
day
came
at
length
and
marion
went
away
hame
wi
her
son
to
introduce
him
the
road
was
gayan
lang
and
jock
crappin
began
to
craw
he
speered
a
hunder
times
about
the
meat
at
goodman
niddery
house
and
every
answer
that
marion
gae
was
better
than
the
last
till
jock
believed
he
was
gaun
home
to
a
continual
feast
it
was
a
delightful
thought
for
the
craving
appetite
within
him
was
come
to
a
great
height
they
reached
the
place
and
went
into
the
kitchen
jock
een
were
instantly
on
the
but
they
didna
need
to
range
far
above
the
fire
there
hung
two
sides
of
bacon
more
than
three
inches
deep
of
fat
besides
many
other
meaner
objects
the
hind
legs
of
bullocks
sheep
and
deer
were
also
there
but
these
were
withered
black
and
sapless
in
appearance
jock
thought
the
very
substance
was
dried
out
o
them
but
the
bacon
how
it
did
make
jock
smack
his
lips
it
was
so
juicy
that
even
the
brown
bristly
skin
on
the
outside
of
it
was
all
standing
thick
o
eenbright
beaming
drops
like
morning
dew
jock
was
established
at
goodman
niddery
he
would
not
have
flitted
again
and
left
these
two
sides
of
bacon
hanging
there
for
an
estate
marion
perceived
well
where
the
sum
of
his
desires
was
fixed
and
trembled
for
fear
of
an
instant
attack
well
might
she
for
jock
had
a
large
dirk
or
sheathed
knife
a
very
useful
weapon
that
he
wore
and
that
he
took
twice
out
of
its
place
looked
at
its
edge
and
then
at
the
enormous
bacon
ham
which
was
more
than
three
inches
deep
of
solid
fat
with
the
rich
drops
of
juice
standing
upon
the
skin
jock
drew
his
knife
on
his
sandal
then
on
the
edge
of
a
wooden
table
that
stood
beside
him
examined
the
weapon
edge
again
and
again
fixed
his
green
eyes
on
the
bacon
what
do
the
people
mean
thought
he
to
himself
that
they
do
not
instantly
slice
down
a
portion
of
that
glorious
meat
and
fry
it
on
the
coals
would
they
but
give
me
orders
to
do
it
would
they
even
give
me
the
least
hint
how
slashingly
i
would
obey
none
of
them
had
the
good
sense
to
give
jock
ony
sic
orders
he
was
two
or
three
times
on
the
very
point
of
helping
himself
and
at
last
got
up
on
his
feet
it
was
believed
for
the
sole
purpose
of
making
an
attack
on
the
bacon
ham
when
behold
in
came
goodman
niddery
there
your
master
sirrah
whispered
marion
haste
ye
and
whup
aff
your
bonnet
jock
looked
at
him
there
was
something
very
severe
and
forbidding
in
his
countenance
so
jock
courage
failed
him
and
he
even
took
aff
his
bonnet
and
sat
down
with
that
in
his
one
hand
and
the
drawn
knife
in
the
other
marion
heart
was
greatly
relieved
and
she
now
ventured
on
a
little
conversation
i
hae
brought
you
hame
my
lad
goodman
and
i
hope
he
be
a
good
servant
to
you
i
coudna
say
marion
gin
he
be
as
gude
as
you
him
he
do
i
think
he
looks
like
ane
that
winna
be
behind
at
his
bicker
ay
weel
i
wat
goodman
and
that
true
and
i
wadna
wish
it
were
otherwise
slaw
at
the
meat
slaw
at
the
wark
ye
ken
that
a
good
hint
o
my
mother
thinks
jock
to
himsel
what
though
i
should
show
the
auld
niggard
a
sample
the
folk
o
this
house
surely
hae
nae
common
sense
the
dinner
was
now
however
set
down
on
the
the
goodman
sat
at
the
head
the
servants
in
a
row
on
each
side
and
jock
and
his
mother
at
the
foot
the
goodwife
stood
behind
her
servants
and
gave
all
their
portions
the
dinner
that
day
consisted
of
broad
bannocks
as
hard
as
horn
a
pail
of
thin
sour
milk
called
whig
and
a
portion
of
a
large
kebbuck
positively
as
dry
as
wood
jock
was
exceedingly
dissatisfied
and
could
not
but
admire
the
utter
stupidity
of
the
people
and
their
total
want
of
all
proper
distinction
he
thought
it
wonderful
that
rational
creatures
should
not
know
what
was
good
for
them
he
munched
and
munched
and
gnawed
at
the
hard
bread
and
cheese
till
his
jaws
were
sore
but
he
never
once
looked
at
the
food
before
him
but
leaning
his
cheek
on
his
hand
to
rest
his
wearied
grinders
somewhat
at
every
bite
he
took
and
every
splash
of
the
sour
shilpy
milk
that
he
lapped
in
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
fat
bacon
ham
with
the
juice
standing
on
it
in
clear
bells
marion
wished
herself
fairly
out
of
the
house
for
she
perceived
there
would
be
an
outbreak
and
to
prepare
the
good
people
for
whatever
might
happen
she
said
before
going
away
now
goodwife
my
callant
banes
are
green
and
he
a
fast
growing
twig
i
want
to
ken
if
he
will
get

o
meat
here
i
winna
answer
for
that
marion
he
shall
fare
as
the
lave

but
he
no
very
easily
served
there
are
some
misleared
servants
wha
think
they
never
get
enough
tell
me
this
thing
then
goodwife
will
he
see
enough
ay
i
shall
answer
for
that
part
then
i
shall
answer
for
the
rest
goodwife
jock
had
by
this
time
given
up
contending
with
the
timber
cheese
and
the
blue
sour
milk
and
taking
a
lug
of
a
bannock
in
his
hand
the
size
of
a
shoe
sole
he
went
away
and
sat
down
at
the
where
he
had
a
full
view
of
the
bacon
ham
three
inches
thick
of
fat
with
the
dew
standing
on
its
brown
skin
the
withered
bread
swallowed
rather
the
better
of
this
delicious
sight
so
jock
chewed
and
looked
and
looked
and
chewed
till
his
mother
entered
into
the
security
mentioned
that
is
a
capital
hint
thought
jock
i
shall
verify
my
good
mother
cautionry
for
i
can
stand
this
nae
langer
he
sprang
up
on
a
seat
sliced
off
a
large
flitch
of
bacon
and
had
it
on
the
coals
before
one
had
time
to
pronounce
a
word
and
then
turning
his
back
to
it
and
his
face
to
the
company
he
stood
with
his
drawn
dirk
quite
determined
to
defend
his
prey
the
goodwife
spoke
first
up
gudeness
have
a
care
o
us
see
to
the
menseless
tike
cried
she
i
declare
the
creature
has
na
the
breeding
o
a
whalp
jock
was
well
used
to
such
kind
of
epithets
so
he
bore
this
and
some
more
with
the
utmost
suavity
still
however
keeping
his
ground
goodman
niddery
grinned
and
his
hands
shook
with
anger
as
if
struck
with
a
palsy
but
for
some
reason
or
other
he
did
not
interfere
the
servants
were
like
to
burst
with
laughter
and
jock
kept
the
goodwife
at
bay
with
his
drawn
knife
till
his
slice
was
roasted
and
then
laying
it
flat
on
his
dry
piece
of
bread
he
walked
out
to
the
field
to
enjoy
it
more
at
leisure
marion
went
away
home
and
the
goodman
and
goodwife
both
determined
to
be
revenged
on
jock
and
to
make
him
pay
dear
for
his
audacity
jock
gave
several
long
looks
after
marion
as
she
vanished
on
kettlemoor
but
he
had
left
no
kind
of
meat
in
her
shieling
when
he
came
away
else
it
was
likely
he
would
have
followed
his
mother
home
again
he
was
still
smacking
his
lips
after
his
rich
repast
and
he
had
seen
too
much
good
stuff
about
the
house
of
his
new
master
to
leave
it
at
once
so
he
was
even
fain
to
bid
marion
in
his
heart
wipe
the
filial
tear
from
his
eye
poor
man
and
try
to
reconcile
himself
to
his
new
situation
do
you
carry
aye
that
lang
gully
knife
about
wi
you
master
or
how
do
they
ca
ye
said
his
master
when
they
next
met
after
the
adventure
of
the
bacon
i
hae
aye
carried
it
yet
said
jock
with
great
innocence
and
a
gay
gude
whittle
it
is
ye
maun
gie
that
up
said
niddery
we
dinna
suffer
chaps
like
you
to
carry
sic
weapons
about
our
house
jock
fixed
his
green
eyes
on
his
master
face
he
could
hardly
believe
him
to
be
serious
still
there
was
something
in
his
look
he
did
not
like
so
he
put
his
knife
deeper
into
his
pocket
drew
one
step
back
and
putting
his
under
row
of
teeth
in
front
of
those
above
waited
the
issue
of
such
an
unreasonable
demand
come
come
give
it
up
i
say
give
it
to
me
i
dispose
of
it
for
you
i
see
you
at
the
bottom
o
the
place
my
mother
speaks
about
whiles
thought
jock
to
himself
afore
i
my
gully
either
to
you
or
ony
that
belangs
to
you
he
still
kept
his
former
position
however
and
the
same
kind
of
look
at
his
master
face
only
his
een
grew
rather
greener
wo
you
give
it
up
you
stubborn
thief
then
i
will
take
it
and
give
you
a
good
drubbing
into
the
bargain
when
jock
heard
this
he
pulled
out
his
knife
that
is
a
good
lad
to
do
as
you
are
bidden
said
his
master
but
jock
instead
of
delivering
up
his
knife
drew
it
from
the
sheathe
which
he
returned
to
his
pocket
now
i
sal
only
say
this
said
he
the
first
man
that
tries
to
take
my
ain
knife
frae
me
he
may
do
it
but
he
shall
get
the
length
in
his
monyplies
first
so
saying
he
drew
back
his
hand
with
a
sudden
jerk
goodman
niddery
gave
such
a
start
that
he
actually
leaped
off
the
ground
and
holding
up
both
his
hands
exclaimed
what
a
savage
we
have
got
here
what
a
satan
and
without
speaking
another
word
he
ran
away
to
the
house
and
left
jock
standing
with
his
drawn
knife
in
his
hand
the
goodman
stomach
burned
with
revenge
against
jock
so
that
night
he
sent
him
supperless
to
bed
out
of
requital
for
the
affair
of
the
fat
bacon
and
next
day
the
poor
boy
was
set
down
to
a
very
scanty
breakfast
which
was
not
fair
his
eye
turning
invariably
to
one
delicious
object
the
goodman
perceived
well
what
was
passing
in
his
heart
and
on
some
pretence
first
sent
away
all
the
servants
and
then
the
goodwife
he
next
rose
up
himself
with
his
staff
in
his
hand
and
going
slowly
away
into
the
little
parlour
said
as
he
went
through
the
kitchen
what
can
be
become
o
a
the
and
with
that
entered
the
dark
door
that
opened
in
a
corner
he
made
as
though
he
had
shut
the
door
but
he
turned
about
within
it
and
peeped
back
the
moment
that
he
vanished
was
the
for
jock
he
sprang
from
his
seat
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
and
mounting
a
form
began
to
whang
away
at
the
bacon
ham
some
invidious
bone
or
hard
object
of
some
sort
coming
unfortunately
in
contact
with
the
edge
of
his
knife
his
progress
was
greatly
obstructed
and
though
he
cut
and
sawed
with
all
his
might
before
he
succeeded
in
separating
a
piece
of
about
two
pounds
weight
from
the
main
body
his
master
had
rushed
on
him
from
his
concealment
and
by
one
blow
of
his
staff
laid
him
flat
on
the
floor
the
stroke
was
a
sore
one
for
it
was
given
with
extreme
good
will
and
deprived
jock
of
sensibility
for
the
time
being
he
and
his
form
both
came
down
with
a
great
rumble
but
the
knife
remained
buried
in
the
fat
bacon
ham
and
the
inveterate
goodman
was
not
satisfied
with
felling
the
poor
lad
but
kicked
him
and
laid
on
him
with
his
stick
after
he
was
down
the
goodwife
at
length
came
running
and
put
a
stop
to
this
cruelty
and
fearing
the
boy
was
murdered
and
that
they
would
be
hanged
for
it
she
got
assistance
and
soon
brought
jock
again
to
himself
jock
had
been
accustomed
to
fight
for
his
meat
and
in
some
measure
laid
his
account
with
it
so
that
on
the
whole
he
took
his
broken
head
as
little
to
heart
as
could
have
been
expected
certainly
less
than
any
other
boy
of
the
same
age
would
have
done
it
was
only
a
little
more
rough
than
he
had
been
prepared
to
look
for
but
had
he
succeeded
in
his
enterprise
he
would
not
have
been
ill
content
the
goodwife
and
her
maids
had
laid
him
on
a
kitchen
bed
and
bathed
his
temples
and
on
recovering
from
stupefaction
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
examine
his
pockets
to
see
if
he
had
his
gully
alak
there
was
nothing
but
the
empty
sheathe
then
he
lose
the
field
and
fell
a
blubbering
and
crying
the
goodwife
thought
he
was
ill
and
tried
to
sooth
him
by
giving
him
some
meat
he
took
the
meat
of
course
but
his
heart
was
inconsolable
till
just
when
busy
with
his
morsel
his
eye
chanced
to
travel
to
the
old
place
as
if
by
instinct
and
there
he
beheld
the
haft
of
his
valued
knife
sticking
in
the
bacon
ham
its
blade
being
buried
deep
in
sappy
treasures
he
sprang
over
the
bed
and
traversing
the
floor
with
staggering
steps
mounted
a
form
and
stretched
forth
his
hand
to
possess
himself
again
of
his
gully
aih
gudeness
have
a
care
o
us
cried
the
goodwife
saw
ever
ony
body
the
like
o
that
the
creature
bacon
mad
goodman
goodman
come
here
jock
however
extricated
his
knife
and
fled
though
he
could
scarcely
well
walk
some
of
the
maids
averred
that
he
at
the
same
time
slid
a
corner
of
the
ham
into
his
pocket
but
it
is
probable
they
belied
him
for
jock
had
been
munching
in
the
bed
but
the
moment
before
he
then
went
out
to
his
cows
weak
as
he
was
he
had
six
cows
some
mischievous
calves
and
ten
sheep
to
herd
and
he
determined
to
take
good
care
of
these
as
also
now
that
he
had
got
his
knife
again
not
to
want
his
share
of
the
good
things
about
the
house
of
which
he
saw
there
was
abundance
however
several
days
came
and
went
and
jock
was
so
closely
watched
by
his
master
and
mistress
all
the
time
he
was
in
the
house
that
he
could
get
nothing
but
his
own
scanty
portion
what
was
more
jock
was
obliged
every
day
to
drive
his
charge
far
and
remain
with
them
from
morn
till
evening
he
got
a
few
porridge
in
the
morning
and
a
hard
bannock
and
a
bottle
of
sour
milk
to
carry
along
with
him
for
his
dinner
this
miserable
meal
was
often
despatched
before
eleven
so
that
poor
jock
had
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
fasting
and
contriving
grand
methods
of
obtaining
some
good
meat
in
future
there
was
one
thing
very
teasing
he
had
a
small
shieling
which
some
former
herd
had
built
and
plenty
of
sticks
to
burn
for
the
gathering
or
cutting
he
had
thus
a
fire
every
day
without
any
thing
to
roast
on
it
jock
sat
over
it
often
in
the
most
profound
contemplation
thinking
how
delightfully
a
slice
of
bacon
would
fry
on
it
how
he
would
lay
the
slice
on
his
hard
bannock
and
how
the
juice
would
ooze
out
of
it
never
was
there
a
man
who
had
richer
prospects
than
jock
had
still
his
happiness
lay
only
in
perspective
but
experience
teaches
man
wisdom
and
wisdom
points
out
to
him
many
expedients
among
jock
fat
sheep
there
was
one
fat
ewe
lamb
the
flower
of
the
flock
which
the
goodwife
and
the
goodman
both
loved
and
valued
above
all
the
rest
she
was
as
beautiful
and
playful
as
innocence
itself
and
withal
fat
as
she
could
lie
in
her
there
was
one
rueful
day
and
a
hungry
one
that
jock
had
sat
long
over
his
little
fire
of
sticks
pondering
on
the
joys
of
fat
flesh
he
went
out
to
turn
his
mischievous
calves
whose
nebs
were
never
out
of
an
ill
deed
and
at
that
time
they
had
strayed
into
the
middle
of
a
corn
field
as
bad
luck
would
have
it
by
the
way
he
perceived
this
dawted
ewe
lamb
lying
asleep
in
the
sun
and
out
of
mere
frolic
as
any
other
boy
would
have
done
he
flew
on
above
her
and
tried
if
he
could
hold
her
down
after
hard
struggling
he
mastered
her
took
her
between
his
feet
stroked
her
snowy
fleece
and
soft
downy
cheek
and
ever
as
he
patted
her
repeated
these
words
o
but
ye
be
a
bonny
beast
the
lamb
however
was
not
much
at
her
ease
she
struggled
a
little
now
and
then
but
finding
that
it
availed
not
she
gave
it
over
and
seeing
her
comrades
feeding
near
her
she
uttered
some
piteous
bleats
they
could
afford
her
no
assistance
but
they
answered
her
in
the
same
tremulous
key
after
patting
her
a
good
while
jock
began
to
handle
her
breast
and
ribs
and
found
that
she
was
in
good
earnest
fat
as
this
was
a
ticklish
experiment
for
the
innocent
lamb
jock
was
seized
with
certain
inward
longings
and
yearnings
that
would
not
be
repressed
he
hesitated
long
long
and
sometimes
his
pity
awoke
but
there
was
another
natural
feeling
that
proved
the
stronger
of
the
two
so
jock
at
length
took
out
his
long
knife
and
unsheathed
it
next
he
opened
the
fleece
on
the
lamb
throat
till
its
bonny
white
skin
was
laid
bare
and
not
a
hair
of
wool
to
intervene
between
it
and
the
point
of
his
knife
he
was
again
seized
with
deep
remorse
as
he
contemplated
the
lamb
harmless
and
helpless
look
so
he
wept
aloud
and
tried
to
put
his
knife
again
into
its
sheathe
but
he
could
not
to
make
a
long
tale
short
jock
took
away
the
lamb
life
and
that
not
in
the
most
gentle
or
experienced
way
she
made
no
resistance
and
only
uttered
one
bleat
poor
beast
said
jock
i
ye
like
this
very
ill
but
i
canna
help
it
ye
are
suffering
for
a
your
bits
o
ill
done
deeds
now
the
day
of
full
fruition
and
happiness
for
jock
was
now
arrived
before
evening
he
had
roasted
and
eaten
the
kidneys
and
almost
the
whole
of
the
draught
or
pluck
his
heart
rejoiced
within
him
for
never
was
there
more
delicious
food
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
devils
of
calves
were
going
all
the
while
in
the
middle
of
a
corn
field
which
his
master
saw
from
the
house
and
sent
one
running
all
the
way
to
turn
them
the
man
had
also
orders
to
waken
the
dirty
blackguard
callant
if
he
was
sleeping
and
gie
him
his
licks
jock
was
otherwise
employed
but
as
luck
would
have
it
the
man
did
not
come
into
his
hut
nor
discover
his
heinous
crime
for
jock
met
him
among
the
corn
and
took
a
drubbing
with
all
proper
decorum
but
dangers
and
suspicions
encompassed
poor
jock
now
on
every
side
he
sat
down
to
supper
at
the
bottom
of
the
board
with
the
rest
of
the
servants
but
he
could
not
eat
a
single
morsel
his
eyes
were
not
fixed
on
the
bacon
ham
as
usual
and
moreover
they
had
quite
lost
that
sharp
green
gleam
for
which
they
were
so
remarkable
these
were
circumstances
not
to
be
overlooked
by
the
sharp
eyes
of
his
master
and
mistress
what
the
matter
wi
the
bit
dirty
callant
the
night
said
the
latter
what
ails
you
sirrah
that
you
hae
nae
your
supper
are
you
weel
eneugh
jock
wasna
ill
he
said
but
he
could
not
enter
into
particulars
about
the
matter
any
farther
the
goodman
said
he
feared
the
blade
had
been
stealing
for
he
did
not
kythe
like
ane
that
had
been
fasting
a
day
but
after
the
goodwife
and
he
had
examined
the
hams
kebbucks
beef
barrel
meal
girnel
and
every
place
about
the
house
they
could
discern
nothing
amissing
and
gave
up
farther
search
but
not
suspicion
jock
trembled
lest
the
fat
lamb
might
be
missed
in
the
morning
when
he
drove
out
his
flock
but
it
was
never
remarked
that
the
lamb
was
he
took
very
little
breakfast
but
drove
his
kine
and
sheep
and
the
devils
of
calves
away
to
the
far
field
and
hasted
to
his
wee
housie
he
borrowed
a
coal
every
day
from
a
poor
woman
who
lived
in
a
cot
at
the
road
side
to
kindle
his
fire
and
that
day
she
noticed
what
none
else
had
done
that
his
coat
was
all
sparked
over
with
blood
and
asked
him
of
the
reason
jock
was
rather
startled
by
the
query
and
gave
her
a
very
suspicious
look
but
no
other
answer
i
fear
ye
hae
been
battling
wi
some
o
your
neighbours
said
she
this
was
a
great
relief
for
jock
heart
ay
just
that
said
he
and
went
away
with
his
coal
what
a
day
of
feasting
jock
had
he
sliced
and
roasted
and
roasted
and
ate
till
he
could
hardly
walk
once
when
the
calves
were
going
into
a
mischief
which
they
were
never
out
of
he
tried
to
run
but
he
could
not
run
a
foot
so
he
was
obliged
to
lie
down
and
roll
himself
on
the
ground
take
a
sleep
and
then
proceed
to
work
again
there
was
nutrition
in
the
very
steams
that
issued
from
jock
hut
the
winds
that
blew
over
it
carried
health
and
savoury
delight
over
a
great
extent
of
country
a
poor
hungry
boy
that
herded
a
few
lean
cows
on
an
adjoining
farm
chancing
to
come
into
the
track
of
this
delicious
breeze
became
at
once
like
a
statue
he
durst
not
move
a
step
for
fear
of
losing
the
delicious
scent
and
there
he
stood
with
his
one
foot
before
the
other
his
chin
on
his
right
shoulder
his
eyes
shut
and
his
mouth
open
his
nose
being
pointed
straight
to
jock
wee
housie
the
breeze
still
grew
richer
till
at
last
it
led
him
as
straight
as
there
had
been
a
hook
in
his
nose
to
jock
shieling
so
he
popped
in
and
found
jock
at
the
sublime
employment
of
cooking
and
eating
the
boy
gaped
and
stared
at
the
mangled
body
of
the
lamb
and
at
the
rich
repast
that
was
going
on
but
he
was
a
very
ignorant
and
stupid
boy
and
could
not
comprehend
any
thing
so
jock
fed
him
with
a
good
fat
piece
well
roasted
and
let
him
go
again
to
his
lean
cows
jock
looked
very
plump
and
that
night
his
appearance
was
quite
sleek
somewhat
resembling
that
of
a
young
voluptuary
and
to
lull
suspicion
he
tried
to
take
some
supper
but
not
one
bite
or
soap
was
he
able
to
swallow
the
goodwife
having
by
that
time
satisfied
herself
that
nothing
was
stolen
became
concerned
about
jock
and
wanted
him
to
swallow
some
physic
which
he
peremptorily
refused
to
do
how
can
the
puir
thing
tak
ony
meat
said
she
he
a
swalled
i
the
belly
indeed
i
rather
suspect
that
he
swalled
the
hale
body
the
next
morning
as
jock
took
out
his
drove
the
goodman
was
standing
at
the
road
side
to
look
at
them
jock
heart
grew
cold
as
well
it
might
when
the
goodman
called
out
to
him
callant
what
hae
you
made
o
the
gude
lamb
is
she
no
there
said
jock
after
a
long
pause
for
he
was
so
much
astounded
that
he
could
not
speak
at
the
first
is
she
no
there
cried
the
goodman
again
in
great
wrath
imitating
jock
voice
if
ye
binna
blind
ye
may
see
that
but
i
can
tell
you
my
man
gin
ye
hae
letten
ought
happen
to
that
lamb
ye
had
better
never
hae
been
born
what
can
be
comed
o
the
beast
said
jock
i
had
better
look
the
house
she
may
be
stayed
in
by
herself
jock
didna
wait
for
an
order
but
glad
to
be
a
little
farther
off
from
his
master
he
ran
back
and
looked
the
fold
and
and
every
nettle
bush
around
them
as
he
had
been
looking
for
a
lost
knife
i
can
see
naething
o
her
said
he
as
he
came
slounging
back
hanging
his
head
and
keeping
aloof
from
the
goodman
who
still
carried
his
long
pike
staff
in
his
hand
but
i
mak
you
see
her
and
find
her
baith
said
he
or
deil
be
in
my
fingers
an
i
dinna
twist
your
neck
about
are
you
sure
you
had
her
yestreen
o
yes
jock
was
sure
he
had
her
yestreen
the
women
were
examined
if
they
had
observed
her
as
they
milked
the
cows
they
could
not
tell
none
of
them
had
seen
her
but
they
could
not
say
she
was
not
there
all
was
in
commotion
about
the
steading
for
the
loss
of
the
dawted
pet
lamb
which
was
a
favourite
with
every
one
of
the
family
jock
drove
his
cattle
and
nine
sheep
to
the
field
roasted
a
good
collop
or
two
of
his
concealed
treasure
and
snapped
them
up
but
found
that
they
did
not
relish
so
well
as
formerly
for
now
that
his
strong
appetite
for
fat
flesh
was
somewhat
allayed
yea
even
fed
to
loathing
he
wished
the
lamb
alive
again
he
began
moreover
to
be
in
great
bodily
fear
and
to
provide
against
the
probability
of
any
discovery
being
made
he
lifted
the
mangled
remains
of
his
prey
and
conveyed
them
into
an
adjoining
wood
where
he
covered
them
carefully
up
with
withered
leaves
and
laid
thorns
above
them
now
said
jock
as
he
left
the
thicket
let
them
find
that
out
wha
can
the
goodman
went
to
all
the
herds
around
enquiring
after
his
lamb
but
could
hear
no
intelligence
of
her
till
he
came
to
the
cottage
of
poor
bessie
the
old
woman
that
had
furnished
jock
with
a
coal
every
day
when
he
put
the
question
to
her
the
rock
and
the
lint
fell
out
of
bessie
hand
and
she
sat
a
while
quite
motionless
what
war
ye
saying
goodman
war
ye
saying
ye
had
lost
your
bonnie
pet
lamb
even
sae
bessie
then
goodman
i
fear
you
will
never
see
her
living
again
what
kind
callant
is
that
ye
hae
gotten
he
rather
a
suspicious
looking
chap
i
tentit
his
claes
a
spairged
wi
blude
the
tither
day
and
baith
this
and
some
days
bygane
he
has
brought
in
his
dinner
to
me
saying
that
he
dought
nae
eat
it
goodman
niddery
could
make
no
answer
to
this
but
sat
for
a
while
grumphing
and
groaning
as
some
late
events
passed
over
his
mind
particularly
how
jock
belly
was
swollen
and
how
he
could
not
take
any
supper
but
yet
the
idea
that
the
boy
had
killed
his
favourite
and
eaten
her
was
hardly
admissible
the
deed
was
so
atrocious
he
could
not
conceive
any
human
being
capable
of
it
strong
as
circumstances
were
against
his
carnivorous
herd
he
went
away
with
hurried
and
impatient
steps
to
jock
wee
house
his
old
colley
dog
trotting
before
him
and
his
long
in
his
hand
jock
eyed
him
at
a
distance
and
kept
out
of
his
path
pretended
to
be
engaged
in
turning
the
calves
to
a
right
pasture
and
running
and
threshing
them
with
a
long
goad
for
though
they
were
not
in
any
mischief
then
he
knew
that
they
would
soon
be
in
some
the
goodman
no
sooner
set
his
nose
within
jock
shieling
than
he
was
convinced
some
horrid
deed
had
been
done
it
smelled
like
a
larder
and
moreover
his
old
dog
who
had
a
very
good
scent
was
scraping
among
the
ashes
and
picking
up
fragments
of
something
which
he
seemed
very
much
to
enjoy
jock
did
not
know
what
to
do
when
he
saw
how
matters
stood
yet
he
still
had
hopes
that
nothing
would
appear
to
criminate
him
the
worst
thing
that
he
saw
was
the
stupid
hungered
boy
on
the
adjoining
farm
coming
wading
through
the
corn
he
had
left
his
dirty
lean
kine
picking
up
the
very
roots
of
the
grass
and
had
come
snouking
away
in
hopes
of
getting
another
fat
bit
for
his
impoverished
stomach
but
when
he
saw
goodman
niddery
come
out
of
the
cot
with
impassioned
strides
he
turned
and
ran
through
the
strong
corn
with
his
whole
might
always
jumping
up
as
he
proceeded
the
goodman
called
angrily
on
his
old
dog
to
come
after
him
but
he
would
not
come
for
he
was
working
with
his
nose
and
fore
feet
among
jock
perfumed
ashes
with
great
industry
so
the
goodman
turned
back
into
the
house
and
hit
him
over
the
back
with
his
long
which
made
him
glad
to
give
over
and
come
out
about
his
business
and
away
the
two
went
to
reconnoitre
further
as
soon
as
the
old
dog
was
fairly
again
he
took
up
the
very
track
by
which
jock
had
carried
the
carcase
that
morning
and
went
as
straight
as
a
line
to
the
hidden
treasure
in
the
thicket
the
goodman
took
off
the
thorns
and
removed
the
leaves
and
there
found
all
that
remained
of
his
favourite
and
beautiful
pet
lamb
her
throat
was
all
cut
and
mangled
her
mouth
open
and
her
tongue
hanging
out
and
about
one
half
of
her
whole
body
the
goodman
shed
tears
of
grief
and
wept
and
growled
with
rage
over
the
mangled
form
and
forthwith
resolved
which
was
hardly
commendable
to
seize
jock
and
bring
him
to
that
very
spot
and
cut
his
throat
jock
might
have
escaped
with
perfect
safety
had
he
had
the
sense
or
foresight
to
have
run
off
as
soon
as
he
saw
his
master
enter
the
wood
but
there
seems
to
be
an
infatuation
that
directs
the
actions
of
some
men
jock
did
not
fly
but
went
about
and
about
turning
his
kine
one
while
his
nine
sheep
another
and
always
between
hands
winning
a
pelt
at
one
of
the
calves
till
his
incensed
master
returned
from
the
fatal
discovery
and
came
up
to
him
there
was
one
excuse
for
him
he
was
not
sure
if
the
carcase
had
been
found
for
he
could
not
see
for
the
wood
whether
or
not
his
master
went
to
the
very
place
and
he
never
thought
of
the
sagacity
of
the
dog
when
goodman
niddery
first
left
the
wood
he
was
half
running
and
his
knees
were
plaiting
under
him
with
the
anticipation
of
horrid
revenge
jock
did
not
much
like
his
gait
so
he
kept
always
the
herd
of
cows
and
the
sheep
too
betwixt
himself
and
this
master
of
his
but
the
goodman
was
too
cunning
for
poor
jock
he
changed
his
step
into
a
very
slow
careless
walk
and
went
into
the
middle
of
the
herd
of
cows
pretending
to
be
whistling
a
tune
although
it
was
in
fact
no
tune
but
merely
a
concatenation
of
tremulous
notes
on
c
sharp
without
the
least
fall
of
harmony
he
turned
about
this
cow
and
the
other
cow
watching
jock
all
the
while
with
the
tail
of
his
eye
and
trilling
his
hateful
whistle
jock
still
kept
a
due
distance
at
length
the
goodman
called
to
him
callant
come
hither
like
a
man
and
help
me
to
wear
this
cow
against
the
ditch
i
want
to
get
haud
o
her
jock
hesitated
he
did
not
like
to
come
within
stroke
of
his
long
stick
neither
did
he
know
on
what
pretence
absolutely
to
refuse
his
bidding
so
he
stood
still
and
it
was
impossible
to
know
by
his
looks
whether
he
was
going
to
comply
or
run
off
altogether
his
master
dreaded
the
latter
and
called
to
him
in
a
still
kinder
manner
until
jock
at
last
unfortunately
yielded
the
two
wore
the
cow
and
wore
the
cow
up
against
the
ditch
until
the
one
was
close
upon
her
one
side
and
the
other
upon
her
other
chproo
hawkie
chproo
my
bonnie
cow
cried
the
goodman
spreading
out
his
arms
with
his
clenched
fast
in
his
right
hand
then
springing
by
the
cow
in
a
moment
he
flew
upon
jock
crying
out
with
the
voice
of
a
demon
d
n
you
rascal
but
i
do
for
you
now
jock
wheeled
about
to
make
his
escape
and
would
have
beat
his
master
hollow
had
he
been
fairly
started
or
timeously
apprised
of
his
dreadful
danger
but
ere
he
had
run
four
or
five
steps
the
came
over
the
links
of
his
neck
such
a
blow
that
it
laid
him
flat
on
his
face
in
a
mire
the
goodman
then
seized
him
by
the
cuff
of
the
neck
with
the
one
hand
and
by
the
hair
of
his
head
with
the
other
and
said
with
a
triumphant
and
malicious
laugh
now
get
up
and
come
away
wi
me
my
braw
lad
and
i
let
you
see
sic
a
sight
as
you

let
you
see
a
sight
get
up
like
a
good
cannie
lad
as
he
said
this
he
pulled
jock
by
the
hair
and
kicked
him
with
his
foot
until
he
obliged
him
to
rise
and
in
that
guise
he
led
him
away
to
the
wood
he
had
a
hold
of
his
rough
weatherbeaten
hair
with
the
one
hand
and
with
the
other
he
heaved
the
cudgel
over
him
and
as
they
went
the
following
was
some
of
the
discourse
that
passed
between
them
come

braw
thing

yon
brake
o
the
wood

so
piteously
that
if
his
master
had
not
had
a
heart
of
stone
he
would
have
relented
and
not
continued
in
his
fatal
purpose
but

the
longer
the
more
furious
o

bit
sheep
i
the
wood
ye

you
rascal
you
rogue
you
villain
you
have
confessed
that
you

about
it
when
i
wasna
speiring
ony
sic
question
at
you
you
hound
you
dog
you
savage
wolf
that
you
are
mother
of
god
but

will

scoundrel

hard
blow
tell

now
my
precious
lad
an
ye
war
gaun
to
be
killed
as
ye
ken
something
about
killing
whether
would
you
choose
to
have
your
throat
cut
or
to
have
your
feet
tied
and
be
skinned
alive
o
dinna
kill

dinna
kill

cried
poor
jock
my
dear
master
dinna
kill
me
for
i
canna
brook
it
oh
oh
an
ye
kill
me
i
tell
my
mother
that
will
i
and
what

but
me
oh

and
i
never
do
the
like
again
nay
i
shall
take
warrant
for
that
you
shall
never
do
the
like
again
in
this
melancholy
and
manner
he
dragged
him
on
all
the
way
by
the
rough
towsy
head
kicking
him
one
while
and
beating
him
another
till
he
brought
him
to
the
very
spot
where
the
mangled
remains
of
the
pet
lamb
were
lying
it
was
a
blasting
sight
for
poor
jock
especially
as
it
doubled
his
master
rage
and
stern
revenge
and
these
were
in
all
conscience
high
enough
wrought
before
he
twined
the
hapless
culprit
round
by
the
hair
and
knocked
him
with
his
fist
for
he
had
dropped
the
staff
to
enable
him
to
force
jock
to
the
place
of
sacrifice
and
he
swore
by
many
an
awful
oath
that
if
it
should
cost
him
his
life
he
would
do
to
jock
as
he
had
done
to
that
innocent
lamb
with
that
he
threw
him
on
the
ground
and
got
above
him
with
his
knees
and
jock
having
by
that
time
lost
all
hope
of
moving
his
ruthless
master
by
tears
or
prayers
began
a
struggling
with
the
force
which
desperation
sometimes
gives
and
fought
with
such
success
that
it
was
with
difficulty
his
master
could
manage
him
it
was
very
much
like
a
battle
between
an
inveterate
terrier
and
a
bull
dog
but
in
spite
of
all
that
jock
could
do
the
goodman
got
out
his
knife
it
was
not
however
one
like
jock
for
it
had
a
folding
blade
and
was
very
hard
to
open
and
the
effecting
of
this
was
no
easy
task
for
he
could
not
get
both
his
hands
to
it
in
this
last
desperate
struggle
jock
got
hold
of
his
master
cheek
with
his
left
hand
and
his
nails
being
very
long
he
held
it
so
strait
that
he
was
like
to
tear
it
off
his
master
capered
up
with
his
head
holding
it
back
the
full
length
of
jock
arm
yet
still
being
unable
to
extricate
his
cheek
from
jock
hold
he
raised
up
his
knife
in
his
right
hand
in
order
to
open
it
with
his
teeth
and
in
the
first
place
to
cut
off
jock
hand
and
his
head
afterwards
he
was
holding
down
jock
with
his
right
knee
and
his
left
hand
and
while
in
the
awkward
capering
attitude
of
opening
his
knife
his
face
was
turned
nearly
straight
up
and
his
eyes
had
quite
lost
sight
of
his
victim
jock
held
up
his
master
cheek
and
squeezed
it
still
the
more
which
considerably
impeded
his
progress
in
getting
the
knife
open
and
at
that
important
moment
jock
whipped
out
his
own
knife
his
old
dangerous
friend
and
struck
it
into
the
goodman
belly
to
the
haft
the
moment
he
received
the
wound
he
sprang
up
as
if
he
had
been
going
to
fly
into
the
air
uttered
a
loud
roar
and
fell
back
above
his
dead
pet
lamb
lord
how
jock
ran
he
was
all
bespattered
with
blood
some
of
it
his
own
and
some
of
it
his
master
wanted
the
bonnet
and
had
the
bloody
knife
in
his
hand
and
was
without
all
doubt
a
wild
boy
as
he
sped
through
the
wood
he
heard
the
groans
and
howls
of
his
master
in
the
agonies
of
death
behind
him
every
one
of
them
added
to
jock
swiftness
till
it
actually
became
beyond
the
speed
of
mortal
man
if
it
be
true
that
love
lends
a
pair
of
wings
fear
mortal
fear
lends
two
pair
there
is
nought
in
life
i
regret
so
much
as
that
i
did
not
see
jock
in
this
flight
it
must
have
been
such
an
extraordinary
one
there
was
poor
jock
flying
with
the
speed
of
a
fox
from
all
the
world
and
yet
still
flying
into
the
world
he
had
no
home
no
kindred
to
whom
he
durst
now
retreat
no
hold
of
any
thing
in
nature
save
of
his
own
life
and
his
good
whittle
and
he
was
alike
unwilling
to
part
with
either
of
these
the
last
time
he
was
seen
was
by
two
women
on
he
appeared
sore
bespent
but
was
still
running
on
with
all
his
might
the
goodman
was
found
before
the
evening
but
only
lived
to
tell
how
he
had
come
by
his
end
all
his
friends
and
servants
were
raised
and
sent
in
pursuit
of
jock
how
he
eluded
them
no
man
knows
but
from
that
day
marion
jock
has
never
been
more
seen
or
heard
of
in
this
land
chapter
vii
that
story
of
our
captain
is
rather
an
odd
story
is
it
not
mark
rather
of
the
wonderful
i
dinna
ken
but
i
could
maybe
tell
ye
something
about
him
an
i
liket
said
tam
craik
but
i
wad
maybe
be
as
wise
to
haud
my
tongue
i
wad
like
very
weel
to
hear
mair
about
him
said
charlie
for
his
life
has
had
such
a
queer
beginning
it
maun
surely
hae
had
a
queer
end
but
what
an
it
shouldna
be
endit
yet
yardbire
said
tam
jock
is
perhaps
living
and
to
tell
his
ain
tale
however
we
say
nae
mair
about
that
just
now
till
you
tell
us
what
you
think
o
gibbie
jordan
tale
for
my
part
i
never
heard
a
tale
i
was
sae
muckle
interested
in
a
my
life
it
is
ane
o
the
best
tales
the
that
ever
i
heard
said
charlie
it
is
a
most
abominable
tale
said
the
poet
in
what
way
master
poet
said
charlie
i
dinna
like
to
hear
ony
body
condemned
without
reason
it
is
for
the
badness
of
the
moral
that
i
do
it
dislike
said
the
poet
the
moral
is
so
truly
bad
all
mankind
it
must
must
shock
it
is
to
kill
this
harmless
lamb
the
flower
of
all
the
flock
to
feed
upon
her
lovely
form
that
fairer
than
the
snow
to
eat
her
flesh
and
drink
her
blood
it
makes
mine
eyes
to
flow
gude
faith
an
i
thought
that
war
his
drift
i
wad
brain
him
said
charlie
and
i
confess
it
looks
rather
like
it
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
said
master
michael
scott
the
maid
delany
is
the
favourite
lamb
whom
he
wishes
you
to
kill
and
feast
on
in
the
same
delicious
manner
as
did
the
hero
of
his
tale
and
i
am
the
goodman
whom
you
are
to
stick
afterwards
and
fairly
make
your
escape
it
is
a
shocking
tale
i
really
doubt
said
charlie
and
throws
a
disgrace
and
an
imputation
o
something
unseemly
on
my
chief
and
a
his
friends
and
i
winna
put
up
wi
it
i
do
propose
that
from
the
walls
the
caitiff
we
do
throw
said
the
poet
or
kill
and
eat
for
dainty
meat
the
laird
of
peatstacknowe
i
fear
if
the
votes
were
to
be
just
now
he
wad
hae
an
ill
chance
said
charlie
but
it
fair
in
ha
where
beards
wag
a
let
ilk
ane
of
us
hae
a
fair
chance
there
may
be
mae
bad
morals
amang
us
wha
turn
next
charlie
himself
being
next
in
point
of
seniority
was
called
on
for
his
tale
i
hae
been
thinking
hard
what
tale
i
should
tell

charlie
but

find
i
can
tell
nought
but
the
thing
i
hae
seen

wi

score
o
good
men
but
there
were
nane
o
them

horses
but
the
elliots
and
some
gentlemen
of
the
scotts
when
sir
ringan
saw
us
coming
he
came
out
on
foot
to
meet
us
and
when
the
gentlemen
of
our
party
saw
that
they
lighted
off
their
horses
gae
them
to
their
henchmen
and
walked
out
before
the
men
howpasley
walked
on
the
right
hand
my
father
next
and
as
he
desired
me
i
came
slounging
up
next
him
i
lookit
best
on
foot
for
my
legs
were
sic
a
length
i
was
higher
in
fact
by
half
a
foot
than
either
john
of
howpasley
or
my
father
but
a
perfect
tripe
for
when
our
captain
the
brave
redhough
came
near
to
us
i
thought
i
should
hae
swarfed
my
heart
like
a
man
humblin
bear
and
i
was
maist
gasping
for
breath
i
had
hard
sae
muckle
o
his
bravery
that
i
expectit
an
auld
gruff
austere
carle
as
proud
as
lucifer
to
meet
us
but
instead
o
that
i
sees
a
boardly
knight
in
the
very
prime
o
manly
beauty
his
cheeks
were
ruddy
his
eyes
dark
and
the
black
beard
on
his
booner
lip
was
just
beginning
to
curl
upward
my
heart
was
a
his
ain
at
the
first
look
and
i
said
to
mysel
ye
the
man
that
i
risk
my
neck
wi
ony
day
i
likit
him
sae
weel
that
i
mind
i
thought
i
could
just
hae
lain
down
in
a
gutter
and
letten
him
tramp
on
the
tap
o
me
he
first
shook
howpasley
by
the
hand
and
then
my
father
and
then
he
gave
a
broad
look
to
my
beardless
face
turning
his
eye
back
to
my
father
that
my
charlie
sir
ringan
my
only
son
now
said
my
father

welcome

he
if

brave
a
man
as
your

shall
never
want
a
hero
at
my
side
i
should

could

the
grimy
potts
and
the
laidlaws
and
you
shall
form
my
flying
party
my
father
here
interrupted
him
with
na
na
my
master
deil
a
flying
troop
i
lead
if
it
binna
a
fighting
ane
it
winna
follow
me
lang
the
warden
smiled
and
calling
out
all
the
men
of
the
families
he
had
named
he
put
such
of
them
as
had
horses
under
the
command
of
my
father
of
these
there
were
so
that
our
troop
consisted
of
fifty
men
in
all
we
were
joined
with
the
elliots
but
habby
having
ninety
men
of
his
own
name
the
command
of
the
horse
devolved
on
him
and
my
father
was
only
looked
on
as
the
second
i
didna
like
this
unco
weel
but
it
coudna
be
helped
and
i
was
glad
to
be
in
the
field
ony
way
the
first
sight
we
got
o
the
english
was
frae
the
top
o
penchrist
but
a
that
day
we
could
only
ken
where
they
were
by
the
reek
they
were
raising
my
blood
boiled
when
i
saw
them
burning
the
houses
o
scotsmen
and
fain
wad
i
hae
had
a
wi
them
there
was
ae
message
came
after
another
a
that
day
the
kers
had
been
beat
and
chased
across
the
river
and
the
english
host
had
their
territory
our
chief
didna
seem
to
care
for
that
sae
muckle
as
i
thought
nor
wad
he
stir
his
foot
till
they
crossed
the
rule
there
war
mae
men
came
in
every
hour
for
the
beacons
were
a
bleezing
and
as
soon
as
the
english
set
foot
on
the
territory
of
the
middle
marches
away
we
rade
straight
to
meet
them
it
was
on
the
hill
of
hawthornside
where
i
first
saw
the
face
o
an
enemy
and
i
never
forget
sic
queer
strummings
as
i
had
within
me
oh
i
wad
fain
hae
been
at
them
there
was
a
kind
o
yeuk
a
kind
kittling
a
sort
o
prinkling
in
my
blood
like
that
i
fand
wadna
be
cured
but
by
the
slap
o
a
sword
or
the
point
o
a
spear
instead
being
feared
for
a
wound
i
wad
hae
my
horse
and
light
armour
baith
to
have
had
a
good
prodd
frae
an
englishman
but
i
wad
hae
liket
that
the
warden
had
seen
me
we
kept
the
hills
between
them
and
the
border
wi
our
horse
but
the
foot
kept
the
straits
to
the
westward
forbye
the
elliots
and
my
father
troop
o
potts
and
olivers
and
laidlaws
the
warden
had
three
hundred
scotts
on
horseback
so
that
in
all
he
had
short
o
five
hundred
horse
and
about
eight
hundred
foot
at
the
head
o
his
horse
he
rade
straight
up
to
the
faces
o
the
english
and
challenged
them
in
our
king
name
to
tell
their
business
in
that
place
up
came
an
english
knight
sir
robert
neville
of
ravensworth
and
he
crackit
baith
proudly
and
saucily
but
i
didna
ken
weel
what
he
said
he
threatened
no
to
leave
a
beast
or
a
body
atween
borthwick
and
the
border
our
captain
was
as
crouse
as
the
other
sae
there
was
nothing
but
ill
blude
atween
them
but
the
thing
that
we
likit
warst
of
a
was
the
certainty
that
he
had
eight
thousand
men
being
just
sax
for
our
ane
the
warden
then
held
a
council
o
friends
upon
the
top
of
the
hill
and
in
view
of
the
english
host
some
said
ae
thing
and
some
said
another
to
him
but
at
length
he
turned
to
my
father
and
he
says
what
says
our
cousin
walter
o
eskdale
to
a
this
but
i
needna
speer
that
he
never
gae
me
aught
but
ae
advice
a
his
life
i
tell
you
what
i
wad
do
captain
says
my
father
afore
yon
sun
were
twa
down
the
west
i
wad
fight
them
i
kend
what
it
wad
be
said
the
warden
but
my
brave
yardbire
are
you
considering
the
disproportion
o
force
what
that
to
think
about
said
he
the
greater
the
better
the
warden
claspit
him
in
his
arms
and
the
tears
came
hopping
down
my
muckle
soft
flobby
cheeks
yes
captain
continued
my
father
i
hae
been
thinking
o
the
odds
against
us
and
i
am
thinking
just
now
but
ye
ken
art
may
do
muckle
now
to
hear
him
speaking
about
art
said
the
warden
pushing
him
playfully
around
by
the
shoulder
to
hear
a
man
speaking
sagely
about
art
that
never
thought
of
ony
other
art
in
his
life
but
hard
hand
nevel
pray
now
my
dear
cousin
will
ye
let
us
hear
this
deep
profound
art
o
yours
that
will
enable
ae
man
to
beat
half
a
dozen
i
wad
form
our
little
army
into
the
shape
o
a
wedge
said
my
father
and
i
wad
yerk
that
little
wedge
into
the
heart
of
their
great
log
of
an
army
and
split
it
a
to
shivers
g
d
a
mercy
hear
to
him
cried
the
warden
and
pray
what
is
to
form
the
point
o
this
wedge
yardbire
just
my
grey
naig
head
captain
i
kend
weel
what
it
wad
come
to
cousin
your
grey
naig
head
wad
soon
be
cracked
but
an
ought
were
to
happen
yours
what
wad
come
o
me
i
thought
sae
muckle
o
my
auld
father
that
i
couldna
haud
my
tongue
nae
langer
and
that
was
the
first
word
i
ever
spake
to
the
warden
in
my
life
never
fear
my
master
quo
i
it
winna
be
ilka
ane
that
sal
crack
his
grey
crown
the
day
weel
said
charlie
cried
the
auld
hero
and
he
waved
his
cap
round
his
head
weel
said
little
charlie
now
captain
for
the
wedge
the
warden
lookit
a
good
while
at
us
without
speaking
and
i
gart
mysel
trow
there
was
a
blink
o
admiration
in
his
dark
eye
ah
wat
wat
said
he
weel
do
you
ken
i
ower
ready
to
follow
your
mad
schemes
but
they
have
sae
often
proved
successfu
though
wi
very
hard
wark
that
i
take
the
risk
and
sey
your
skill
aince
mair
he
then
drew
his
horse
from
the
height
into
the
glen
behind
and
formed
them
precisely
on
my
father
plan
with
a
troop
of
horse
in
front
and
one
on
each
wing
the
foot
being
arranged
in
close
column
in
the
middle
and
as
my
father
claimed
the
post
of
honour
as
his
right
he
rode
the
front
man
will
nicol
and
i
were
next
him
and
behind
us
there
were
four
of
the
laidlaws
i
saw
no
farther
but
was
informed
after
that
when
the
horse
made
the
charge
the
foot
had
orders
to
run
and
keep
up
with
them
we
took
a
sweep
down
the
water
to
the
north
and
appeared
all
of
a
sudden
in
the
rear
of
the
english
army
their
scouts
had
seen
us
but
could
not
guess
our
intent
for
as
to
a
thought
of
our
attacking
them
that
never
entered
their
heads
so
that
their
host
was
not
farther
than
their
columns
facing
about
toward
us
they
deemed
we
were
going
to
retreat
toward
the
north
and
were
making
ready
to
pursue
us
when
all
at
once
the
point
of
the
wedge
turned
at
a
right
angle
and
rushed
with
all
haste
on
the
centre
of
their
line
then
there
was
such
a
hubbub
and
calling
and
noise
of
armour
rattling
throughout
their
army
as
i
had
never
heard
my
father
spurred
on
and
after
some
few
hard
blows
opened
the
line
he
had
the
least
to
do
of
any
for
the
ranks
opened
naturally
before
him
as
he
heaved
his
heavy
sword
but
ever
as
their
wedge
grew
thicker
their
columns
being
pressed
together
lay
the
heavier
on
our
flanks
and
several
gallant
men
of
the
scots
fell
i
saw
naething
o
this
but
soon
fand
the
effects
of
it
for
my
father
drove
faster
on
than
the
flankers
could
bear
up
after
him
and
our
point
lengthened
out
and
grew
thinner
at
every
step
i
had
been
unco
keen
o
fighting
but
i
got
my
fill
then
i
trow
i
gae
some
o
them
some
gay
good
yerks
on
the
chafts
ravensworth
by
this
time
perceiving
the
danger
in
which
his
army
stood
of
being
divided
brought
up
his
side
columns
and
closed
around
our
front
i
heard
him
saying
in
a
loud
exasperated
voice
for
shame
countrymen
for
shame
will
ye
suffer
a
landward
scots
laird
an
auld
crabbit
loun
like
that
to
ride
in
through
your
ranks
and
out
through
your
ranks
as
they
were
files
o
thistles
down
with
the
moorland
thief
down
with
him
aha
robin
o
ravensworth
is
that
you
cried
my
father
an
i
win
within
sword
length
o
you
i
shall
settle
your
crack
as
he
said
this
he
raised
himself
up
in
his
stirrups
auld
will
nicol
roared
out
for
christ
sake
master
stop
but
in
place
of
that
he
spurred
up
to
the
captain
with
all
his
might
challenging
him
to
come
forward
neville
kept
his
ground
and
prepared
for
the
attack
but
refused
to
come
forward
and
just
as
my
father
and
he
began
to
measure
swords
my
father
was
struck
by
six
or
seven
spears
all
at
once
on
his
left
side
some
of
these
he
received
on
his
buckler
but
others
of
them
pierced
his
side
and
before
any
of
us
could
lend
him
the
least
assistance
he
was
unhorsed
ravensworth
also
gave
him
a
wound
as
he
was
falling
i
who
was
close
behind
him
and
of
all
the
rest
was
now
hard
bested
i
clove
the
head
of
the
first
spearman
on
my
left
and
ere
i
had
recovered
my
sword
from
the
stroke
ravensworth
sword
was
at
my
breast
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
stroke
would
have
slain
me
had
it
not
been
for
a
plunge
made
by
my
father
horse
that
came
between
us
and
marred
it
by
this
time
the
laidlaws
had
come
up
on
my
right
a
wheen
as
hardy
determined
louns
as
ever
brak
warld
bread
and
they
were
laying
about
them
like
incarnate
devils
the
horse
kept
the
lancers
from
reaching
me
on
the
left
so
that
ravensworth
and
i
met
fairly
hand
to
hand
sure
am
i
that
i
never
gae
sic
a
straik
sinsyne
nor
ane
sic
good
will
i
dinna
think
i
clave
his
helmet
but
i
gae
him
sic
a
devil
o
a
knab
on
the
temple
that
he
was
stoundit
and
fell
as
dead
as
a
stane
at
my
horse
feet
my
father
was
at
that
time
on
his
knee
and
i
saw
him
trying
to
raise
himself
up
by
the
for
he
had
never
yet
quitted
the
bridle
of
his
horse
he
saw
me
bring
down
neville
who
fell
almost
at
his
very
side
and
he
looked
to
me
and
cried
weel
done
little
charlie
weel
done
my
brave
man
that
was
the
last
word
i
ever
heard
him
say
my
brave
worthy
auld
father
he
was
sae
used
to
ca
me
little
charlie
when
i
was
young
that
he
coudna
gie
it
ower
when
i
grew
bigger
than
him
and
he
cried
to
me
weel
done
little
charlie
weel
done
my
brave
man
i
never
forget
that
moment
my
honest
father

a
hearty
greet
at
this
part
o
my
tale

the
same
ay
he
often
me
little
charlie
and
he
cried
weel
done
my
brave
man
that
was
the
hindmost
word
and
i
hae
good
right
to
mind
it
the
battle
thickened
and
thickened
round
us
and
we
were
borne
back
for
there
was
sic
a
rush
made
by
the
english
to
the
rescue
that
an
their
captain
had
been
living
they
wad
hae
tramped
him
to
pieces
i
was
driven
clean
stupid
and
cared
nae
ae
preen
for
my
life
after
i
saw
the
ranks
rush
over
my
father
but
the
laidlaws
defendit
me
and
did
most
excellent
work
i
never
saw
ony
men
that
thought
less
about
fleeing
or
retreating
than
the
laidlaws
swap
for
swap
was
a
that
they
countit
on
i
heard
davie
o
craik
saying
to
his
brother

that
lang
swabble
charlie
and
keep
by
his
side
deil
hae
him
gin
he
be
nae
better
than
he
looks
like
the
grim
potts
were
mair
cunning
than
rash
and
the
olivers
could
be
led
but
never
driven
the
laidlaws
were
the
men
for
me
yank
for
yank
thresh
on
will
ay
here
davie
deil
tak
the
hindmost
i
hae
stood
mony
a
stoure
wi
the
laidlaws
and
never
wished
for
better
lads
and
a
thegither
but
i
forgetting
my
tale
for
aince
i
get
into
the
mids
o
a
battle
it
no
easy
getting
me
out
again
i
canna
tell
you
a
the
feats
that
were
done
that
day
especially
by
the
warden
when
he
saw
the
great
brulzie
in
front
he
came
up
with
the
scotts
and
the
johnstons
and
the
grahams
o
drife
and
hearing
that
my
father
had
fallen
and
that
the
english
captain
was
also
slain
he
took
the
front
himself
and
scattered
the
english
commoners
like
crows
when
we
had
thus
fairly
broke
through
the
centre
we
turned
to
the
right
and
drove
that
division
of
the
army
before
us
till
they
took
shelter
in
jed
forest
but
seeing
the
rest
who
formed
the
strongest
wing
marshalling
up
behind
us
we
drew
off
to
the
hills
and
encamped
that
night
at
the
brae
of
rule
there
was
heavy
mourning
for
the
loss
of
my
father
and
we
buried
him
next
day
at
hassendean
the
english
were
as
much
exasperated
dick
neville
the
brother
of
sir
robert
took
the
command
and
up
teviot
they
came
laying
all
waste
behind
them
we
durst
not
engage
them
again
in
close
battle
for
they
were
by
far
too
numerous
but
we
kept
hovering
around
them
and
harrassing
them
whenever
we
could
get
a
chance
in
spite
of
all
we
could
do
they
took
the
town
of
hawick
plundered
it
and
burnt
it
to
ashes
the
warden
was
neither
to
haud
nor
to
bind
anger
then
and
as
he
durst
not
leave
the
country
nor
tine
sight
them
for
an
hour
himself
he
sent
off
hab
elliot
and
me
wi
our
hunder
and
fifty
horse
to
plunder
the
castle
and
lands
of
ravensworth
by
way
of
retaliation
now
charlie
said
he
to
me
at
parting
mind
what
the
nevilles
hae
done
baith
to
you
and
me
and
neither
leave
them
cow
nor
ewe
man
woman
nor
bairn
blanket
nor
sheet
dish
nor
spoon
aweel
aff
habby
and
i
set
he
wi
his
elliots
and
me
wi
my
olivers
my
grimy
potts
my
laidlaws
and
auld
will

between
tyne

fand
oursels
at
the
place
where
the
twa
tynes

we
were
terrified
for
raising
the
country
and
were
obliged
to
ride
out
to
a
little
hollow
place
in
a
wild
moor
and
hide
oursels
a
the
day
where
our
horses

o
the
nevilles
an
unco
surprise
habby
gaed
up
by
himsel
to
the
gate
and
asked
a
word
o
the
porter
the
man
came
snooving
out
half
sleeping
habby
had
him
dead
and
the
keys
in
his
ain
hand
in
half
a
minute
it
was
a
shamefu
morning
that
for
we
killed
and
harried
and
burnt
a
that
came
afore
us
and
lady
ravensworth
was
burnt
and
her
bairn
was
trowed
to
be
burnt

sat
sair
on
my
conscience
for
she
came
to
me
and
beggit
her
life
i
had
nae
thought
o
taking
her
life
but
i
was
sae
intent
on
the
spulzie
that
i
lost
her
again
and
never
saw
mair
o
her
it
was
rather
cruel
o
habby
to
lock
every
door
when
he
set
fire
to
the
castle
i
saved
ae
little
chap
that
morning
though
i
wasna

were
flinging
blankets
and

a
torrent
of
vain
jesting
remember
that
the
words
of
thy
mouth
are
for
death
or
life
for
the
possession
of
maiden
beauty

most
dismal

miserable

whisht
whisht
tam
returned
charlie
i
hae
a
gay
wide
wizen
when
i
am
amang
friends
but
there
are
some
things
that
i
canna
swallow
for
that
where
was
i
at
aye
at
the
sacking
o
ravensworth
we
drave
the
richest
prey
that
morning
that
i
ever
yet
saw
liftit
if
we
had
gotten
it
a
hame
we
had
thirty
horses
laden
wi
stuff
and
other
thirty
led
anes
besides
thirteen
score
o
good
cattle
and
we
gae
the
banks
o
the
teme
and
the
blackburn
an
unco
singe
afore
we
left
them
i
was
rather
against
the
burning
but
habby
wadna
be
stayed
na
na
tit
for
tat
charlie
that
will
stand
for
hawick
and
abbotrule
we
drave
on
and
drave
on
as
fast
as
the
cattle
could
gang
and
some
the
heavy
soft
anes
we
were
obliged
to
leave
behind
sair
against
our
wills
we
were
terrified
for
raising
the
country
for
we
had
sic
a
far
drive
but
luckily
the
nevilles
had
amaist
every
man
with
them
in
their
expedition
into
scotland
and
the
first
time
that
we
hovered
was
on
in
northumberland
a
little
before
the
break
o
day
at
that
place
there
was
the
strangest
thing
happened
to
us
that
ever
happened
to
men
and
it
was
for
that
that
i
began
my
tale
my
heart
had
been
unco
sair
a
the
night
wi
thinking
about
the
bonnie
lady
neville
o
ravensworth
and
i
had
often
been
sae
grieved
about
her
death
and
her
bairn
death
that
i
hardly
kend
what
i
was
doing
i
thought
i
saw
her
kneeling
on
her
knee
and
begging
of
me
to
spare
her
life
and
the
life
o
her
child
and
then
how
cruel
it
was
in
me
to
rin
away
rummaging
up
the
stair
and
lose
the
opportunity
of
preserving
her
these
thoughts
had
made
my
heart
wholly
inclined
to
pity
and
as
soon
as
we
lighted
i
sought
out
will
laidlaw
o
craik
to
see
if
he
had
still
been
able
amang
a
the
confusion
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
child
will
had
had
a
great
deal
o
trouble
wi
him
chiefly
from
his
associates
but
he
had
him
still
safe
an
sound
he
had
stuffed
him
in
a
horse
pack
o
blankets
and
sheets
his
head
and
had
kept
beside
him
a
the
gate
and
now
when
i
found
him
he
had
laid
the
boy
down
on
the
heather
to
sleep
and
had
him
weel
happit
up
and
will
himsel
was
lying
streekit
beside
him
he
thought
that
i
wad
gibe
him
about
the
business
and
tried
to
waive
the
subject
but
when
i
told
him
how
much
i
was
pleased
wi
what
he
had
done
he
grew
rather
crouser
and
could
speak
about
naething
else
but
the
boy
and
his
little
sayings
to
him
by
the
way
poor
little
dear
soul
said
will
i
think
some
body
had
flung
him
the
castle
wa
in
an
armfu
claes
and
never
kend
and
wha
kens
but
he
may
be
the
heir
o
ravensworth
himsel
he
has
been
sae
miraculously
saved
that
he
will
surely
come
to
something
but
do
ye
ken
charlie
my
heart
is
already
sae
closely
knitted
to
that
bit
helpless
bairn
that
i
wadna
see
ony
ill
come
ower
him
for
a
the
kye
on
the
laidlaw
you
shall
never
rue
your
kindness
o
heart
and
attentions
to
that
puir
misfortunate
bairn
quo
i
the
moment
that
i
saw
you
take
him
up
and
row
him
in
a
blanket
his
head
as
ye
had
been
rowing
up
a
wab
i
resolved
to
reward
you
wi
my
hale
share
o
the
spulzie
never
speak
about
that
charlie
if
we
get
safe
hame
wi
every
thing
we
no
differ
about
the
spulzie
ha
but
will
your
rowing
up
o
the
bairn
was
a
rare
scene
ony
other
body
but
you
ye
ken
wad
hae
taken
the
creature
up
in
their
arms
and
rowed
a
blanket
about
it
but
instead
o
that
you
doubled
a
pair
blankets
their
hale
length
on
the
green
laid
the
bairn
across
the
one
end
o
them
and
rowed
it
ower
the
body
and
ower
the
body
and
ower
the
body
till
ye
came
to
the
far
end
and
it
was
but
ill
rowed
up
after
a
ha
ha
ha
hout
charlie
deil
a
bit
but
ye
ower
muckle
up
about
trifles
i
wish
ye
wad
think
mair
about
the
perilous
situation
we
are
in
watch
a
wee
while
and
let
me
get
a
sleep
will
then
laid
his
arm
over
the
boy
and
the
hott
o
claes
and
fell
sound
asleep
our
men
were
a
placed
two
and
three
around
the
hale
muir
to
guard
the
cattle
and
all
were
resting
on
their
arms
to
be
ready
to
rush
together
on
any
alarm
i
was
sitting
and
keeping
a
good
look
out
a
round
about
and
will
he
was
swuffing
and
sleeping
every
thing
was
quiet
except
now
and
then
that
the
hum
of
an
ox
was
to
be
heard
which
missed
his
neighbour
or
the
eiry
whistle
o
the
it
was
a
while
before
the
and
i
was
just
beginning
to
turn
drowsy
when
i
thought
i
saw
something
white
on
the
muir
about
two
hundred
strides
from
me
st
mary
be
my
buckler
said
i
to
mysel
what
can
you
be
it
is
surely
a
flight
o
white
mist
risen
out
o
the
earth
for
i
see
it
moving
if
it
be
a
mist
fawn
as
i
dare
say
it
can
be
naething
else
it
has
drawn
itself
up
into
a
form
the
likest
that
of
a
woman
of
ought
ever
i
saw
as
i
was
mumbling
and
speaking
this
to
mysel
i
perceived
that
it
still
drew
nearer
and
that
it
wasna
ane
o
the
fairy
fawns
o
mist
whiles
to
be
seen
stealing
about
i
the
but
a
lady
a
clad
in
white
it
glided
athort
the
moor
and
athort
the
moor
as
if
it
had
been
looking
for
something
it
had
lost
and
at
last
i
saw
it
spring
away
from
one
point
to
another
at
a
considerable
distance
as
swift
as
a
flash
o
fire
as
if
something
had
startled
or
offended
it
i
learned
after
that
the
point
from
which
it
fled
was
the
very
spot
where
habby
elliot
lay
and
who
at
that
time
was
lying
in
a
sound
and
troubled
sleep
when
it
again
stopped
its
motions
were
very
extraordinary
for
though
the
morning
was
dark
there
was
such
a
pale
and
a
pure
whiteness
about
it
that
i
saw
it
the
better
it
was
like
a
streamer
o
light
or
the
reflection
of
a
starn
in
the
water
that
aye
in
the
darkest
nights
appears
brightest
when
it
paused
at
the
place
i
mentioned
it
bent
its
body
backward
its
arms
were
crossed
on
its
breast
and
i
saw
like
its
hair
streaming
in
the
air
behind
it
then
it
spread
both
its
hands
toward
heaven
as
in
the
act
of
making
fervent
supplication
from
that
point
it
came
straight
toward
me
after
giving
a
shiver
that
made
all
my
een
dazzle
will
laidlaw
cried
i
but
in
a
violent
whisper
below
my
breath
will
laidlaw
o
craik
for
god
sake
waken
up
and
see
what
this
is
i
was
sitting
but
will
sprang
to
his
feet
and
seized
his
sword
where
where
where
where
is
it
charlie
where
is
it
callant
whispered
he
i
pointed
to
it
but
durst
not
speak
will
rubbed
his
een
and
rubbed
his
een
and
at
length
perceived
it
i
do
believe
lad
that
is
some
hizzy
and
a
weel
dressed
ane
she
is
said
he
still
speaking
in
a
whisper
and
sitting
down
close
beside
me
what
on
god
earth
can
she
be
seeking
on
this
waste
at
sic
an
untimely
hour
i
durst
hardly
draw
my
breath
let
be
to
answer
him
and
sae
he
continued
i
think
it
wad
hae
been
as
an
she
had
lain
still
in
her
bed
rather
as
comed
raiking
out
amang
a
wheen
wild
men
on
sic
a
wild
height
oho
wager
my
neck
it
is
some
spy
in
disguise
she
was
by
this
time
within
ten
paces
o
us
and
we
both
sat
still
in
breathless
suspense
till
she
came
close
to
us
i
thought
i
had
seen
the
face
before
but
couldna
tell
where
till
she
kneeled
on
one
knee
at
my
feet
crossed
her
hands
and
looked
me
in
the
face
with
the
most
piteous
expression
of
countenance
then
i
saw
it
was
the
lady
o
ravensworth
and
in
the
very
posture
that
i
had
seen
her
for
the
first
and
last
time
yet
there
was
no
anger
in
her
face
it
seemed
merely
a
look
of
supplication
and
at
length
she
touched
her
lips
three
times
as
an
intimation
that
she
wished
to
speak
and
could
not
as
for
me
my
mouth
was
sealed
and
that
i
might
see
nae
mair
than
i
had
seen
i
threw
mysel
agroof
wi
my
face
to
the
ground
and
held
by
the
heather
firmly
baith
my
hands
honest
will
had
nae
suspicions
o
ony
thing
beyond
nature
and
at
length
he
says
what
are
you
wanting
wi
us
madam
that
ye
making
a
thae
murgeons
you
do
not
know
me
returned
she
but
that
young
warrior
beside
you
does
he
has
been
guilty
of
a
neglect
that
he
will
rue
till
the
day
of
his
death
but

she
bent
her
body
over
him
in
the
most
affectionate
way
and
stretched
her
arms
as
if
to
embrace
him
but
she
neither
touched
him
nor
any
part
of
laidlaw
claes
the
boy
had
awakened
and
when
will
held
him
out
to
give

sae
ye

thinks
i
to
mysel
an
ye
kend
about
this
as
weel
as
i
do
i
saw
naething
that
was
passing
for
i
was
lying
close
on
my
face
and
hinging
by
the
heather
but
i
heard
a
that
was
said
and
will
tauld
me
the
rest
afterwards
he
said
she
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
above
her
child
breast
then
over
his
own
head
as
he
stooped
forward
with
him
in
his
arms
then
she
glided
aside
and
made
the
cross
over
my
head
and
shoulders
and
it
was
heaven
grace
that
i
didna
ken
else
i
wad
hae
swarfed
away
last
of
all
she
again
bent
herself
over
her
child
and
stretched
out
her
arms
on
each
side
of
him
then
leaning
herself
back
on
the
air
she
arose
gently
from
the
ground
and
sailed
away
through
the
dim
shades
of
the
morning
toward
the
verge
of
the
heaven
i
wondered
what
was
asteer
then
for
i
heard
will
crying
on
the
virgin
mary
to
preserve
him
and
rhaming
the
names
o
a
the
saints
he
had
ever
heard
of
and
at
length
he
gae
a
great
gluther
like
a
man
drowning
and
fell
down
wi
sic
a
dunt
he
gart
a
the
moss
shake
again
the
bairn
screamed
and
grat
and
i
didna
ken
what
to
do
for
i
durstna
look
up
for
fear
o
seeing
the
ghost
till
at
length
i
heard
that
the
rest
of
the
sentinels
had
caught
the
alarm
and
were
passing
the
frae
ane
to
another
and
then
i
ventured
to
set
up
my
head
but
gude
and
gracious
sic
a
grip
as
i
did
haud
by
the
heather
i
took
up
the
child
covered
him
with
my
cloak
and
soothed
him
and
the
poor
little
harassed
thing
hid
his
face
in
my
bosom
will
lay
quivering
and
struggling
like
ane
in
a
dream
or
under
the
influence
of
the
and
after
i
had
rolled
him
three
times
over
he
awoke
in
the
most
horrid
consternation
charlie
where
are
ye
speak
to
me
charlie
and
tell
me
where
i
am
then
a
whole
string
o
saints
and
angels
were
a
invoked
one
after
another
ower
and
ower
again
mercy
on
us
charlie
i
hae
had
sic
a
dream
as
never
mortal
man
had
and
sae
plain
and
sae
particular
i
could
amaist
swear
it
was
real
what
do
ye
think
charlie
didna
this
bairn
mother
come
to
me
in
my
sleep
and
she
says
to
me
bairn
mine
na
that
wasna
what
she
said
first
dinna
ken
me
says
she
and
then
will
began
and
told
me
all
that
i
had
heard
pass
between
them
before
and
all
that
i
had
seen
and
some
part
that
i
had
not
seen
but
a
that
i
could
do
i
couldna
persuade
him
that
it
wasna
a
dream
and
it
was
better
it
was
sae
for
if
he
had
kend
and
believed
that
he
had
conversed
with
a
spirit
it
wad
hae
put
him
daft
it
pat
me
clean
out
o
my
judgment
and
for
that
day
and
mony
a
day
and
night
after
i
kend
nae
mair
what
i
was
doing
than
ane
dreaming
and
remembered
nae
mair
what
i
had
been
doing
than
if
i
had
been
asleep
all
the
time
i
can
therefore
gie
but
a
puir
and
a
lame
account
o
what
followed
for
it
is
maistly
from
hearsay
although
i
was
tauld
that
i
bure
a
principal
hand
in
the
fray
we
started
at
the
scraigh
o
day
and
drove
on
there
were
always
four
or
five
light
horsemen
well
mounted
who
rode
before
our
array
to
see
if
the
coast
was
clear
and
as
we
went
round
the
head
of
the
gowan
burn
about
ane
o
these
came
galloping
back
and
told
us
that
the
english
were
awaiting
us
at
the
fords
of
keilder
with
an
army
of
a
thousand
horse
aha
quo
habby
elliot
i
thought
we
warna
to
get
hame
this
way
we
hae
just
twa
choices
callants
either
to
fight
or
flee
there
was
not
a
man
in
all
our
little
army
that
could
think
of
scampering
off
for
bare
life
and
leaving
such
a
prey
behind
him
so
with
one
assent
we
rode
forward
in
a
body
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
that
overlooks
the
fords
of
keilder
the
english
were
stationed
on
a
rising
ground
to
the
west
of
the
river
and
that
being
passable
only
by
one
ford
which
was
very
rough
we
could
not
attack
them
without
the
certainty
of
being
cut
to
pieces
so
we
kept
our
station
on
the
steep
brae
over
against
them
and
sent
some
few
of
our
oldest
and
weakliest
men
to
be
moving
the
prey
out
toward
we
calculated
the
english
to
be
about
five
hundred
but
neither
durst
they
cross
the
ford
to
come
to
us
they
sent
a
few
flights
of
arrows
among
our
men
which
we
regarded
very
little
and
determined
if
possible
to
keep
them
at
bay
there
till
our
rich
prey
had
crossed
the
border
fell
but
just
at
the
fall
of
the
evening
to
our
great
surprise
the
english
rushed
at
once
into
the
ford
with
loud
and
reiterated
shouts
and
scarcely
had
we
begun
to
advance
down
the
steep
to
meet
them
when
we
were
attacked
by
another
body
of
horsemen
behind
these
men
were
led
by
a
great
priest
whose
name
was
bishop
boldone
but
who
was
always
called
and
at
the
very
first
encounter
hab
elliot
rushed
among
the
english
ranks
and
slew
the
bishop
with
his
own
hand
at
the
first
blow
but
it
cost
habby
dear
for
he
was
cut
down
in
endeavouring
to
retreat
and
fell
under
a
dozen
of
spears
in
short
our
small
band
being
inclosed
between
two
stronger
bodies
was
literally
hewed
in
pieces
but
not
before
they
had
slain
a
great
number
of
our
enemies
will
laidlaw
and
i
fought
side
by
side
and
though
enclosed
in
the
very
middle
of
our
foes
we
cut
our
way
through
and
escaped
without
a
wound
and
with
short
pursuit
our
prey
was
gone
we
saw
a
great
part
of
them
scattered
on
the
hills
and
heard
them
lowing
as
they
returned
toward
their
native
pastures
our
drivers
having
watched
the
fate
of
the
day
made
their
escape
when
they
saw
us
surrounded
abandoning
the
spoil
we
two
fled
in
silence
toward
the
and
could
not
even
get
time
to
look
for
the
child
in
whom
we
were
both
so
much
interested
we
had
lost
our
well
earned
prey
we
had
lost
our
friends
and
companions
in
arms
and
we
had
lost
our
honour
by
suffering
ourselves
to
be
surprised
by
the
ambush
behind
yet
we
both
felt
as
if
the
loss
of
the
child
sat
heavier
on
our
hearts
than
all
there
was
something
so
mysterious
in
our
connection
with
him
that
it
could
not
fail
making
a
deep
impression
on
our
minds
the
vision
that
we
had
seen
and
the
promise
that
had
been
made
to
us
that
for
what
we
had
done
our
heads
should
be
shielded
in
the
day
of
battle
soon
recurred
to
us
and
we
both
agreed
that
our
escape
was
miraculous
and
perfectly
unaccountable
to
ourselves
there
were
not
two
in
the
battle
who
exposed
themselves
more
and
laidlaw
averred
that
he
sometimes
saw
twenty
weapons
raised
against
us
at
once
and
that
still
as
we
approached
the
bearers
of
them
seemed
to
lose
the
power
of
striking
it
was
no
wonder
that
we
were
impressed
with
deep
awe
nor
that
we
both
wished
it
had
been
in
our
power
to
have
preserved
the
boy
over
whose
life
there
seemed
to
be
some
good
guardian
spirit
permitted
or
appointed
to
watch
our
conversation
was
all
about
him
there
had
been
a
nest
made
for
him
in
a
pack
of
clothes
laidlaw
had
led
the
horse
himself
all
the
way
and
the
child
had
chatted
to
him
till
the
alarm
was
given
that
we
were
waylaid
and
he
had
then
given
the
horse
in
charge
to
one
of
the
drivers
with
particular
injunctions
to
take
care
of
the
child
but
he
could
not
even
remember
who
that
driver
was
i
came
up
immediately
after
and
charged
the
lad
to
take
care
of
the
child
and
in
the
hearing
of
several
of
my
followers
said
that
i
would
rather
they
lost
the
whole
drove
than
that
ought
should
happen
to
him
but
now
we
had
lost
him
we
had
lost
all
but
our
horses
and
our
swords
we
jogged
on
all
the
night
in
melancholy
mood
crossed
the
border
and
then
turned
westward
toward
the
which
we
reached
about
a
little
after
the
break
of
day
as
we
were
coming
through
a
hollow
of
the
height
called
the
we
perceived
something
before
us
that
appeared
to
be
moving
and
of
a
prodigious
bulk
which
after
some
hesitation
we
made
up
to
and
found
that
the
phenomenon
consisted
of
eight
horses
all
well
loaden
and
every
one
with
its
head
yerked
to
the
tail
of
the
one
before
him
and
all
these
were
driven
by
one
yeoman
on
horseback
who
rode
beside
them
with
a
long
goad
in
his
hand
we
soon
overtook
and
examined
him
and
never
was
i
so
much
astonished
in
my
life
as
when
i
found
it
was
my
own
henchman
auld
will
nicol
he
was
very
dour
and
shy
of
communication
at
first
will
nicol
is
it
you
said
i
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
did
you
escape
humph
i
think
i
may
as
weel
speir
that
question
at
you
humph
says
will
i
thought
you
had
fallen
with
the
rest
in
the
battle
said
i
humph
but
i
here
says
will
and
i
think
there
mae
here
nor
me
humph
and
i
rather
think
i
hae
brought
mair
wi
me
nor
some
fock
humph
i
comed
as
fu
handit
as
some
fock
i
think
humph
but
will
were
you
in
the
engagement
what
need
ye
speir
that
humph
where
was
i
else
but
in
the
engagement
and
did
you
stay
till
it
was
over
humph
i
stayed
lang
aneuch
i
think
humph
it
is
needless
to
wait
ower
lang
on
a
seen
bad
job
humph
but
the
real
truth
of
the
story
was
that
instead
of
staying
till
the
battle
was
ower
will
didna
stay
till
it
began
nor
near
that
time
he
was
an
chap
will
and
had
a
great
deal
o
foresight
and
when
he
saw
us
begin
to
stop
and
the
english
standing
peaceably
before
us
as
he
it
he
was
sure
there
were
more
enemies
coming
up
behind
will
if
i
were
sure
that
ye
deserted
our
cause
and
came
off
before
the
engagement
began
said
i
although
i
have
not
a
man
left
that
i
ken
o
but
will
o
craik
and
yoursel
may
i
be
a
coward
and
a
traitor
if
i
wadna
cut
you
down
i
the
place
where
you
stand
will
had
nothing
to
say
for
himself
but
humph
humph
and
he
scratched
his
head
and
grumbled
i
was
quite
indignant
at
the
old
fellow
and
was
getting
into
a
greater
rage
than
ever
i
hae
been
in
at
a
friend
sinsyne
when
all
at
once
i
heard
a
weak
tremulous
voice
say
daddy
boy
cold
shouted
will
laidlaw
as
loud
as
he
could
yell
hilloa
hilloa
hilloa
and
he
sprang
first
on
the
back
of
his
own
horse
with
his
feet
and
from
that
he
darted
upon
one
of
those
that
carried
the
packs
when
i
rode
up
he
was
sitting
on
the
rumple
o
the
beast
hugging
the
child
that
he
had
deemed
lost
in
his
bosom
kissing
him
and
exclaiming
aih
my
man
my
dear
man
are
ye
safe
are
ye
safe
god
bless
auld
will
nicol
god
bless
auld
will
nicol
it
was
impossible
for
two
and
warriors
to
be
more
uplifted
at
any
incident
than
will
laidlaw
and
i
were
at
discovering
that
the
boy
was
safe
and
even
auld
will
nicol
began
to
recover
some
i
heard
you
giving
a
chap
some
charges
about
him
that
i
kend
weel
caredna
if
his
head
were
off
od
he
was
ane
the
olivers
what
cares
an
oliver
for
a
man
life
or
a
bairn
either
sae
i
thinks
sin
my
young
master
has
a
liking
for
the
bairn
i
gang
and
look
after
him
it
is
a
good
sign
of
a
young
warrior
to
like
to
save
women
and
bairns
sae
i
gangs
and
sae
i
thinks
sin
i
is
bringing
away
this
wee
chap
out
o
danger
i
may
as
weel
bring
something
wi
me
as
naething
sae
i
brings
aught
o
the
best
horses
and
the
best
laden
anes
that
i
could
wale
and
bound
for
the
border
a
fashous
job
i
hae
had
wi
them
a
night
it
is
needless
to
tell
how
frankly
auld
will
was
forgiven
the
being
a
rallying
point
on
all
border
raides
we
stayed
there
a
whole
day
and
a
night
in
hopes
that
some
part
of
our
men
wad
come
up
but
out
of
all
my
fifty
men
there
were
none
appeared
but
three
of
the
potts
the
olivers
had
been
slain
to
a
man
and
all
the
laidlaws
save
my
brave
companion
out
of
ninety
valiant
elliots
there
were
only
twelve
remaining
and
some
of
these
were
of
the
drivers
there
were
scots
and
nearly
as
many
english
with
at
their
head
buried
in
one
cairn
and
for
the
sake
of
the
bishop
the
english
raised
a
heap
of
stones
above
them
as
huge
as
an
abbey
church
which
will
be
seen
on
the
height
above
the
ford
of
keilder
for
ever
laidlaw
slept
that
night
in
a
good
bed
with
the
boy
in
his
arms
for
we
had
no
lack
of
the
finest
blankets
and
sheets
and
that
night
the
white
lady
appeared
to
him
again
claiming
her
child
yet
still
declining
to
accept
of
him
and
promising
will
protection
on
earth
and
a
reward
in
heaven
if
he
continued
to
guard
and
protect
that
boy
whether
this
was
in
a
dream
or
not
laidlaw
could
not
be
positive
but
he
rather
inclined
to
think
he
was
wide
awake
for
he
remembered
of
speaking
to
her
audibly
among
other
things
she
asked
him
if
he
knew
it
was
the
child
that
had
slept
by
him
on
the
waste
the
night
before
the
battle
will
said
he
was
sure
she
asked
him
how
he
answered
that
unless
the
fairies
had
changed
him
it
could
nae
be
ony
other
but
the
fairies
or
some
one
else
may
change
him
said
she
you
may
be
separated
amid
the
confusion
and
uproar
now
on
the
border
and
when
you
meet
again
you
may
not
be
able
to
prove
the
identity
of
my
child
i
bade
you
the
other
night
examine
his
bosom
but
you
neglected
to
do
so
if
you
had
you
would
there
have
found
the
spur
of
ravensworth
testifying
his
lineage
and
descent
to
all
the
world
will
came
to
me
in
a
great
ferment
the
next
day
and
told
me
of
all
this
i
had
heard
the
same
words
the
night
before
the
battle
but
had
quite
forgot
them
among
other
matters
and
wist
as
little
what
they
meant
as
will
did
i
hae
lookit
a
his
bits
o
claes
and
graepit
them
a
said
he
but
i
can
find
nae
spur
how
could
there
be
a
spur
about
a
nakit
bairn
it
is
may
be
in
amang
the
blankets
it
is
perhaps
some
private
mark
said
i
let
us
examine
the
body
very
narrowly
on
doing
so
we
found
a
slight
mark
on
his
breast
that
seemed
to
have
been
made
by
applying
a
hot
iron
at
some
time
previous
and
it
was
exactly
in
the
form
of
a
v
with
the
wrang
end
uppermost
so
we
both
concluded
that
this
was
a
private
mark
of
some
family
that
neither
fairies
nor
men
kend
o
and
that
it
was
perhaps
a
stamp
that
keepit
them
a
away
it
is
the
stamp
of
the
heirs
lineal
of
the
house
of
neville
said
the
friar
i
have
impressed
it
with
my
own
hand
after
many
masses
and
ave
marias
said
what
became
of
that
child
or
whither
is
he
gone
i
pray
thee
to
inform
us
in
the
words
of
truth
not
lengthened
out
alas
i
can
not
tell
he
was
visited
by
the
white
lady
of
ravensworth
every
night
and
when
the
gloaming
came
she
would
be
seen
hovering
on
the
skirts
of
the
wood
near
to
him
i
grew
that
i
durstna
sleep
a
night
within
ten
miles
o
him
and
will
laidlaw
turned
clean
bumbazed
about
the
thing
sae
we
were
obliged
to
send
him
to
board
wi
auld
lady
lawder
her
that
was
put
out
o
the
convent
for
witchery
and
the
ill
arts
she
cared
nought
about
spirits
and
conversed
wi
the
white
lady
as
she
had
been
her
door
neighbour
and
it
was
said
there
were
strange
mysterious
sayings
past
between
them
she
the
boy
the
boy
and
learned
him
mony
other
things
foreby
that
were
thought
to
be
nae
better
than
they
should
hae
been
she
chauntit
sangs
til
him
and
tauld
him
tales
and
there
was
little
doubt
meant
to
breed
him
up
to
be
a
terrible
enchanter
but
afore
that
could
be
effeckit
the
white
lady
came
and
took
him
away
a
thegither
from
that
day
he
has
never
been
seen
or
heard
of
in
this
world
neither
as
boy
nor
man
and
now
sirs
i
find
that
my
story
worn
to
a
head
hair
and
that
i
maun
cut
it
short
so
it
is
done
and
that
an
end
chapter
viii
i
have
been
a
skipper
in
my
time
and
something
more
anon
i
tell
it
you
ogilvie
it
is
nae
worth
the
name
of
a
story
that
said
tam
craik
for
in
the
first
place
it
is
a
lang
story
in
the
second
place
it
is
a
confused
story
and
in
the
third
place
it
ends
ower
abruptly
and
rather
looks
like
half
a
dozen
o
stories
linkit
to
ane
anither
tails
the
poet
was
by
this
time
on
his
feet
and
coming
forward
to
charlie
he
looked
him
sublimely
in
the
face
stretched
out
his
hand
and
spoke
as
follows
there
is
some
being
he
dwells
that
watches
the
fates
of
mortal
men
now
do
i
know
it
yea
and
that
same
being
has
spirits
of
all
casts
at
his
command
that
run
and
fly
and
trim
and
trim
and
trim
about
this
world
and
it
is
even
true
that
i
have
seen
of
these
yet
knew
them
not
look
here
brave
hero
man
of
heart
and
hand
and
see
if
thou
canst
note
thy
mark
once
seen
thy
spur
thy
a
without
the
crossing
stroke
thy
v
with
the
wrong
end
upmost
is
it
here
the
poet
bowed
his
breast
and
exposed
it
to
charlie
eye
which
at
the
first
scrutinizing
look
discerned
the
mark
he
had
formerly
seen
the
mark
of
the
spur
of
ravensworth
charlie
visage
altered
into
lengthened
amazement
it
could
scarcely
have
been
more
strongly
marked
when
he
was
visited
by
the
white
lady
on
tersit
moor
even
when
he
was
glad
to
hide
his
face
in
the
moss
and
hold
by
the
heather
with
both
his
hands
and
are
you
really
the
chap
that
i
threw
out
at
the
window
in
the
castle
of
ravensworth
said
he
and
boarded
wi
auld
lady
lawder
the
creature
that
had
a
ghaist
for
its
guardian
and
a
witch
for
its
nurse
but
what
need
i
spier
my
ain
een
convinces
me
gude
faith
but
we
are
a
queer
set
that
are
prickit
up
on
the
top
o
this
tower
thegither
i
am
amaist
terrified
to
enquire
where
you
have
been
since
the
white
lady
took
you
away
for
ye
must
have
been
in
the
fairy
land
or
the
country
o
the
gruesome
ghaists
or
perhaps
in
a
waur
place
than
either
we
are
a
queerer
set
than
you
are
thinking
of
said
tam
for
here
am
i
standing
tam
craik
liege
man
and
true
to
the
brave
scottish
warden
and
i
carena
wha
kens
it
now
but
i
am
neither
less
nor
mair
a
man
than
just
marion
jock
o
the
that
sliced
the
fat
bacon
ate
the
pet
lamb
and
killed
the
auld
miser
goodman
niddery
here
the
same
whittle
yet
and
ready
at
the
service
of
ony
ane
that
requires
it
for
the
same
end
od
we
seem
to
ken
mair
about
ane
anither
than
ony
ane
us
kens
about
ourselves
the
day
wears
on
apace
said
the
master
and
i
foresee
that
there
is
relief
approaching
from
more
quarters
than
one
this
made
all
the
party
spring
to
the
windows
to
look
it
is
not
yet
visible
to
your
eyes
but
it
will
come
time
enough
in
the
meanwhile
it
would
be
as
well
to
get
through
with
the
stories
that
we
may
know
and
fix
on
our
victim
for
perhaps
we
may
need
a
mart
this
night
and
it
being
now
your
turn
liegeman
thomas
or
john
by
right
of
seniority
if
you
know
of
nothing
better
i
should
like
much
to
hear
the
adventures
of
such
a
promising
youth
from
the
day
that
you
made
away
with
the
farmer
to
this
present
time
better
master
michael
scott
said
tam
better
does
your
honour
say
nay
by
my
sooth
i
ken
o
naething
half
sae
good
i
hae
been
an
chap
a
my
life
but
as
you
will
hear
i
hae
guided
others
at
times
but
in
a
middling
way
tam
craik
tale
my
friend
the
laird
has
given
you
my
early
history
perhaps
better
than
i
could
hae
done
myself
but
that
is
to
judge
of
he
hath
added
and
diminished
but
yet
he
told
his
story
wi
some
life
and
a
the
better
that
he
didna
ken
wha
heard
him
in
one
thing
he
was
wrong
informed
for
i
was
not
seen
on
that
night
i
fled
from
the
slaughter
of
the
old
inveterate
wretch
i
ran
in
a
contrary
direction
and
slept
that
night
in
a
at
the
head
of
a
water
called
lanshaw
burn
many
a
hard
night
i
have
had
but
that
was
one
of
the
bitterest
of
them
all
i
did
not
rue
having
killed
the
goodman
for
i
rejoiced
at
having
let
out
his
dirty
miserable
life
and
saved
my
own
but
then
i
was
sure
to
be
taken
up
and
hanged
for
a
murderer
and
i
was
chased
away
from
my
mother
and
my
country
and
durst
not
face
a
human
being
i
saw
some
goats
and
some
sheep
and
would
gladly
have
killed
one
to
have
eaten
for
i
saw
hunger
staring
me
in
the
face
but
they
would
not
let
me
come
near
them
i
likewise
saw
a
shepherd
or
forester
house
but
kept
aloof
and
going
up
into
a
wild
bushy
glen
i
cried
myself
asleep
half
naked
as
i
was
and
slept
till
about
the
break
of
day
when
i
awakened
starving
with
hunger
and
cold
i
had
no
shift
but
to
pull
rashes
and
eat
the
white
ends
of
them
which
i
continued
to
do
all
that
day
whenever
i
came
to
a
rash
bush
the
next
night
i
came
to
a
solitary
house
where
i
ventured
to
go
in
and
there
i
first
gave
myself
the
name
of
tam
craik
telling
abundance
of
lies
as
to
my
origin
the
master
of
the
house
was
a
wealthy
vassal
and
had
great
numbers
of
fat
oxen
with
cows
and
calves
besides
a
few
sheep
and
he
kept
me
to
help
him
to
herd
these
promising
me
a
grey
coat
if
i
attended
to
his
satisfaction
he
was
a
most
extraordinary
man
and
none
of
the
best
for
his
words
and
actions
were
at
variance
though
he
conversed
with
me
or
any
one
with
the
utmost
familiarity
i
never
found
out
that
he
had
told
me
one
word
of
truth
the
first
friend
that
came
to
visit
him
after
my
arrival
he
overloaded
so
with
kindness
professions
of
friendship
and
respect
that
i
believed
he
loved
him
as
his
own
soul
and
after
he
was
gone
as
my
master
and
i
went
out
to
the
fields
i
observed
what
a
treasure
it
was
to
have
so
good
and
so
valued
a
friend
as
he
had
in
that
neighbour
of
his
what
was
my
astonishment
to
hear
from
the
same
tongue
that
had
lauded
him
to
the
skies
that
he
was
a
cheat
a
liar
and
a
scoundrel
a
greedy
sordid
wretch
that
robbed
his
own
hinds
and
such
wandering
pedlars
as
came
by
that
road
not
daring
to
venture
on
higher
game
one
who
seduced
men
wives
and
daughters
indiscriminately
and
was
in
short
a
perfect
demon
and
a
pest
to
the
whole
neighbourhood
but
master
why
did
you
caress
and
commend
him
so
much
to
his
face
o
that
is
all
very
well
that
goes
all
for
nothing
he
is
to
be
sure
a
vile
scoundrel
there
are
queer
people
in
this
world
thought
i
there
is
nothing
for
it
i
see
but
mind
the
farmer
continued
very
kind
to
me
in
his
own
deceitful
way
but
the
meat
that
we
got
was
very
bad
it
consisted
of
lean
beef
and
venison
as
black
as
soot
with
plenty
of
milk
but
as
for
bread
we
had
none
of
any
description
so
from
the
day
that
i
entered
to
his
service
i
determined
to
kill
a
lamb
or
a
sheep
of
any
sort
the
first
time
i
could
get
one
but
i
never
could
get
the
least
chance
and
might
as
well
have
tried
to
get
hold
of
a
deer
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
delicious
feasting
that
i
had
in
my
little
shieling
dear
as
it
had
like
to
have
cost
me
and
every
day
my
appetite
for
fat
flesh
became
more
insufferable
till
at
last
by
a
grand
expedient
i
got
satisfaction
of
it
i
had
thirty
fat
stots
in
my
herd
and
i
observed
that
in
hurrying
them
through
a
bog
they
sunk
and
stuck
quite
fast
so
having
no
other
resource
i
drove
a
few
of
them
one
day
when
i
was
very
hungry
into
a
mire
in
a
wood
and
rushing
forward
on
them
while
they
were
struggling
i
sticked
the
fattest
among
them
to
the
heart
so
that
he
floundered
and
bled
to
death
in
the
slough
well
done
again
marion
jock
said
i
to
myself
here
is
feasting
for
you
now
here
is
a
feast
that
will
last
you
a
twelve
month
at
odd
times
if
you
can
but
preserve
it
i
declare
when
i
began
to
cut
up
that
huge
animal
i
almost
trembled
at
my
atrocity
but
these
kind
of
feelings
soon
wear
off
i
was
obliged
to
eat
some
collops
that
day
without
any
cooking
and
never
relished
ought
better
i
wish
we
saw
such
a
meal
again
my
thin
yellow
beard
was
a
little
discoloured
to
be
sure
but
that
was
nothing
i
washed
it
and
went
home
as
boldly
among
the
rest
as
if
nothing
wrong
had
been
done
when
i
returned
to
my
prey
i
found
to
my
great
grief
that
the
foxes
dogs
ravens
and
every
savage
beast
and
hind
on
these
mountains
were
determined
to
share
with
me
they
had
actually
eaten
more
in
that
one
night
than
would
have
served
me
a
week
so
the
next
day
i
employed
myself
in
cutting
off
all
the
good
fat
and
savoury
pieces
and
secreted
them
in
covering
them
up
with
stones
this
i
did
to
preserve
them
from
the
beasts
and
from
putrefaction
and
that
day
i
am
sure
i
had
at
least
ten
stones
weight
of
excellent
beef
the
white
and
red
were
so
beautifully
mixed
it
did
one
heart
good
to
look
at
it
pleasures
are
of
short
date
and
the
greatest
pleasures
have
the
shortest
my
master
went
over
the
lake
next
day
to
look
at
my
herd
and
i
knew
the
ox
would
be
missed
had
it
not
been
for
my
beloved
beef
i
would
have
made
my
escape
forthwith
but
my
heart
was
knit
to
it
and
for
my
life
i
could
not
leave
it
i
went
home
at
night
in
great
terror
but
to
my
joy
i
never
saw
my
master
half
so
kind
he
told
me
i
had
suffered
one
of
my
stots
to
be
stolen
but
what
could
the
like
of
me
help
it
he
had
a
rough
guess
who
had
taken
him
and
would
perhaps
make
him
repent
it
i
was
perfectly
overjoyed
at
this
construction
and
resolved
to
revel
in
feasting
and
gladness
but
next
day
when
i
went
back
to
my
ox
the
hide
was
neatly
taken
off
him
so
also
was
the
head
and
both
were
taken
away
this
was
perfectly
unaccountable
to
me
and
i
saw
the
marks
of
men
feet
in
the
mire
confirming
the
fact
that
some
body
had
been
there
stealing
the
head
and
the
skin
of
my
ox
which
were
in
my
eyes
not
worth
half
the
labour
of
taking
them
off
i
knew
not
what
to
make
of
this
but
it
was
evident
that
my
prey
had
been
discovered
by
some
one
and
all
that
i
could
calculate
farther
on
was
that
the
hide
had
been
stolen
by
some
body
who
stood
in
need
of
it
for
shoes
and
the
head
by
one
who
wanted
it
was
all
one
to
me
as
i
grew
more
and
more
a
favourite
with
my
master
who
now
began
to
caress
me
more
than
his
own
sons
no
young
lad
in
the
land
could
be
more
thrifty
about
meat
than
i
was
being
anxious
to
have
the
remainder
of
my
bullock
out
of
sight
i
stole
salt
and
a
small
barrel
and
salted
my
stuff
in
a
hole
below
ground
then
when
no
very
good
meat
was
going
by
day
at
my
master
house
i
often
fasted
the
greater
part
of
it
and
then
taking
a
coal
by
night
i
stole
away
into
the
wood
and
roasted
and
boiled
and
feasted
the
whole
night
the
beef
was
delicious
and
it
was
amazing
what
great
quanties
i
sometimes
snapped
up
at
once
for
even
after
i
thought
i
could
eat
no
more
there
was
a
part
of
white
marrowy
substance
about
the
joints
and
the
sides
of
the
bones
that
i
could
not
give
over
no
man
could
give
it
over
marry
how
delicious
it
was
i
account
that
fine
meat
mixed
with
white
that
lies
wedged
in
along
the
doublings
and
shelves
of
the
bones
as
the
most
glorious
species
of
man
food
round
the
broad
for
instance
the
that
through
which
we
look
for
the
storms
think
but
of
the
layers
of
the
red
and
the
white
that
lie
bedded
around
that
peatstacknowe
let
me
feel
your
shoulder
i
suppose
a
man
has
no
ah
no
none
blessed
virgin
when
shall
i
again
shire
the
long
crooked
slices
of
the
red
meat
mixed
with
white
from
the
flats
and
the
hollows
of
a
broad
he
is
hungering
and
yearning
to
pick
my
bones
the
cannibal
dog
said
gibby
but
it
brings
me
in
mind
of
a
good
saying
and
a
true
the
swine
that
is
most
eager
to
feed
itself
is
the
first
slaughtered
to
feed
others
the
hath
drawn
thee
aside
from
thy
onward
relation
thou
froward
and
voracious
one
said
the
friar
verily
it
is
better
for
thee
that
thou
return
to
thy
tale
before
thy
strength
be
consumed
within
thee
the
loss
of
this
sturdy
ox
of
my
master
gave
rise
to
strange
matters
matters
which
quite
confounded
my
judgment
and
which
to
this
day
i
do
not
comprehend
my
master
went
away
to
the
sheriff
and
the
lord
of
the
manor
and
made
a
complaint
that
his
neighbour
had
stolen
one
of
his
cattle
the
best
that
he
had
on
his
farm
this
was
the
man
that
he
caressed
so
much
yet
knew
to
be
a
scoundrel
the
complaint
was
attended
to
and
the
injury
deeply
resented
my
master
returned
with
a
strong
body
of
men
and
orders
to
seize
glendairg
and
search
all
his
premises
and
if
evidence
appeared
against
him
he
was
to
be
carried
before
lord
william
called
the
severe
and
there
imprisoned
in
the
dungeon
till
time
should
be
given
him
to
clear
himself
which
if
he
failed
to
do
in
a
certain
period
he
was
to
be
swung
all
my
servants
men
and
women
were
ordered
to
proceed
with
the
party
i
went
among
the
rest
and
certainly
never
witnessed
so
curious
a
scene
glendairg
came
out
and
met
the
party
with
all
the
consciousness
of
innocence
and
even
when
he
was
seized
and
bound
he
still
appeared
to
doubt
of
the
sincerity
of
the
men
espepecially
when
they
told
him
it
was
at
the
instance
of
my
master
if
that
is
all
it
is
well
said
he
i
am
sure
my
kind
friend
and
neighbour
can
mean
me
no
ill
by
it
my
master
took
him
aside
and
said
to
him
in
the
kindest
and
most
soothing
manner
do
not
be
the
least
disheartened
my
dear
friend
you
know
how
far
i
would
be
from
injuring
you
i
would
not
do
it
for
all
the
cows
in
my
byre
i
ken
weel
wha
has
the
ox
there
is
little
doubt
but
he
is
in
our
neighbour
bauldy
beef
stand
i
have
long
suspected
him
and
many
is
the
good
beast
i
have
lost
you
little
know
how
many
good
beasts
i
have
lost
and
was
still
so
loth
to
make
it
public
but
i
can
suffer
it
no
longer
let
the
skaith
fall
upon
the
skaither
in
the
mean
time
i
know
you
are
quite
innocent
but
i
instituted
this
search
as
a
blind
to
him
you
must
just
submit
and
never
mind
it
o
very
well
neighbour
very
well
said
glendairg
i
knew
you
could
not
intend
me
any
ill
search
all
out
and
in
and
welcome
they
did
so
they
searched
all
out
and
in
and
at
last
when
about
to
give
up
they
found
the
individual
ox
hide
that
i
slew
in
the
bog
lying
hid
deep
below
some
hay
and
corn
in
the
corner
of
a
barn
in
another
place
still
more
unfeasible
they
found
the
ox
head
they
were
both
laid
upon
the
green
and
my
master
and
all
his
servants
myself
included
swore
to
their
identity
as
we
could
not
do
otherwise
glendairg
looked
like
one
bewildered
and
said
there
was
a
plot
laid
against
his
life
which
he
neither
understood
suspected
nor
merited
the
shrieve
officers
laughed
him
to
scorn
and
proposed
to
hang
him
up
on
the
nearest
tree
and
i
believed
they
would
have
done
it
had
it
not
been
for
the
kindness
of
my
master
who
came
forward
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
addressed
them
somewhat
thus
alas
my
masters
this
is
a
heavy
and
a
sorrowful
sight
for
me
this
is
the
bitterest
day
of
my
life
i
have
lost
many
and
many
good
cattle
and
yet
i
would
not
i
could
not
let
myself
suspect
my
intimate
friend
think
how
i
am
grieved
to
see
these
proofs
yet
perhaps
he
may
be
innocent
and
this
may
be
some
vile
plot
laid
against
his
life
i
beg
therefore
that
he
may
be
set
at
liberty
and
the
whole
business
hushed
up
you
are
a
good
man
and
a
kind
said
the
men
but
this
thing
must
not
be
with
our
lord
and
master
justice
must
have
sway
but
we
will
report
your
goodness
and
generosity
to
him
and
be
sure
it
will
not
go
unrewarded
we
can
assure
you
that
this
man
has
not
only
forfeited
his
life
but
all
his
farms
as
well
as
his
stock
of
cattle
and
sheep
to
yourself
for
all
this
my
master
refused
to
be
comforted
but
wept
and
followed
after
the
men
pleading
for
the
life
and
the
freedom
of
his
friend
but
he
pleaded
in
vain
the
men
bound
him
on
a
horse
and
carried
him
away
with
them
to
the
dungeon
of
the
castle
of
coombe
i
marvelled
greatly
at
the
great
kindness
and
generosity
of
my
master
knowing
as
he
did
that
the
man
was
a
scoundrel
but
i
wondered
far
more
what
could
induce
the
man
to
steal
the
hide
and
the
head
from
off
my
ox
my
master
was
a
married
man
and
had
four
children
and
though
he
was
apparently
a
kind
husband
his
wife
seemed
quite
unhappy
and
discontented
which
i
thought
highly
unreasonable
on
her
part
she
knew
more
however
than
i
did
and
there
are
some
small
matters
that
women
never
patiently
put
up
with
he
had
a
number
of
for
the
purpose
of
milking
cows
making
hay
and
cheeses
and
such
things
and
among
them
there
was
a
very
pretty
one
named
kelly
with
whom
he
had
fallen
in
love
and
after
long
toying
and
courting
he
had
seduced
her
i
knew
nothing
about
these
sorts
of
concerns
but
i
thought
kell
as
we
called
her
the
most
beautiful
sprightly
and
innocent
being
that
lived
and
i
liked
to
look
at
her
and
hear
her
speak
and
whenever
she
came
near
me
i
was
like
to
fall
she
slept
with
a
little
child
in
a
large
open
loft
above
the
room
where
my
master
and
mistress
slept
and
it
so
happened
that
something
came
by
night
and
frightened
her
and
she
refused
to
sleep
there
any
longer
without
some
one
beside
her
i
slept
by
myself
in
one
of
the
and
it
was
immediately
proposed
by
my
master
that
my
bed
should
be
removed
and
put
up
in
the
loft
beside
kell
i
was
drunken
with
delight
at
hearing
this
intelligence
yet
i
pretended
to
be
very
averse
to
the
plan
hanging
my
head
and
turning
about
my
back
when
any
one
spoke
of
it
nor
would
i
answer
a
word
to
one
of
them
but
tutt
or
tutts
tam
nosey
it
seems
ye
gaun
to
be
bedded
wi
bonny
kell
the
night
tutt
ye
gaun
up
to
sleep
beside
her
and
do
ye
think
ye
never
brik
lair
tutt
she
a
bonny
burd
yon
tam
ye
maun
tak
care
tutts
well
up
i
went
the
next
night
to
sleep
in
a
bed
that
stood
side
by
side
or
rather
end
by
end
with
that
of
kell
oh
i
was
so
terrified
for
her
or
for
having
any
communication
with
her
that
i
would
not
speak
a
word
even
when
she
spoke
to
me
but
covered
myself
over
the
head
with
the
and
lay
puffing
till
i
was
like
to
choak
for
want
of
breath
i
did
not
sleep
well
at
all
i
could
not
sleep
for
she
was
always
yawning
and
then
saying
and
then
hushing
the
child
to
sleep
the
next
night
i
ventured
to
lye
with
my
head
out
from
beneath
the
clothes
unless
when
she
spoke
which
alarmed
me
exceedingly
and
so
i
did
the
next
night
again
behaving
myself
with
great
magnanimity
at
length
i
came
to
that
pass
that
when
she
spake
to
me
i
did
not
creep
down
beneath
the
but
only
made
a
great
bustle
and
flinging
as
if
i
hiding
myself
this
practice
of
deception
i
continued
for
several
nights
always
making
more
and
more
pouncing
and
scraping
every
time
she
addressed
me
she
laughed
at
me
and
seemed
highly
amused
which
made
me
still
the
worse
at
length
she
said
one
night
pray
do
not
creep
through
the
house
for
fright
what
makes
you
so
afraid
of
me
what
ill
do
you
think
i
will
do
to
you
nosey
i
wish
the
bogle
may
not
come
i
am
afraid
it
will
come
for
i
thought
i
heard
it
look
that
it
do
not
rise
at
the
back
of
your
bed
for
that
is
a
very
dangerous
place
if
it
come
nosey
i
must
either
come
in
beside
you
or
you
must
come
in
beside
tutts
said
i
and
that
was
my
first
word
of
courting
the
first
syllable
that
i
spoke
to
kell
in
that
luckless
loft
i
said
tutts
i
suspected
no
evil
intention
on
the
part
of
my
kind
and
indulgent
master
and
far
less
on
that
of
kell
indeed
how
could
i
suspect
either
one
day
he
said
to
me
in
the
fields
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
about
you
and
that
wench
kell
for
both
your
sakes
i
believe
i
must
separate
you
she
is
fallen
in
love
with
you
quite
over
head
and
ears
and
has
been
complaining
to
our
dame
of
your
unkindness
to
her
we
have
a
great
regard
for
the
girl
and
can
not
part
with
her
but
out
of
respect
for
you
both
you
must
be
separated
i
will
however
trust
you
together
until
next
week
and
if
she
do
not
complain
any
more
you
may
remain
where
you
are
but
i
suppose
i
will
be
obliged
to
part
with
you
then
though
against
my
will
this
was
a
terrible
stound
to
my
heart
and
shewed
my
master
masterly
policy
for
notwithstanding
of
all
my
pretended
aversion
to
the
company
of
women
and
to
that
of
pretty
kell
in
particular
i
would
not
have
been
parted
from
her
at
that
time
for
all
the
world
not
even
for
all
the
beef
and
bacon
that
was
in
it
i
did
not
know
well
how
to
make
up
matters
with
her
so
as
to
retain
my
place
but
i
thought
i
would
try
so
that
night
i
sat
down
on
my
own
with
my
clothes
on
and
scratched
my
head
and
beat
with
my
bare
heel
against
the
loft
but
she
had
lost
all
hope
of
gaining
me
to
the
measures
agreed
on
between
her
and
her
master
and
took
no
heed
of
me
till
i
was
obliged
to
speak
first
myself
when
the
following
highly
interesting
dialogue
passed
between
us
i
unco
feared
the
bogle
come
the
night
kell
so
am
i
i
wasna
sure
but
i
thought
i
heard
it
yestreen
i
aince
thought
that
i
heard
it
a
wee
too
how
does
it
play
when
it
is
gaun
to
rise
it
begins
a
scart
scarting
like
a
rattan
making
holes
i
fancy
to
come
out
and
take
us
away
aih
then
it
has
just
been
it
that
i
heard
oh
warrant
it
was
and
that
i
heard
too
ay
o
it
terrible
we
ill
ill
set
here
but
i
watch
a
night
and
keep
it
aff
you
kelly
with
that
i
came
and
sat
down
on
the
side
of
her
bed
to
keep
the
invidious
scratching
bogle
away
from
her
but
i
soon
became
drowsy
and
was
like
to
fall
down
she
begged
me
to
lay
down
my
head
on
her
pillow
but
i
would
not
hear
of
that
oh
no
no
i
durst
not
lie
down
there
so
i
stretched
me
on
the
loft
at
her
and
fell
asleep
awakening
before
day
the
first
thing
i
heard
was
the
bogle
scratching
kell
had
stretched
her
arm
below
the
bed
on
the
side
opposite
to
me
and
was
scratching
slowly
and
fearfully
then
pretending
to
awake
she
hid
herself
among
the
muttered
prayers
and
cried
i
groaned
and
stretching
my
hand
round
the
corner
scratched
on
the
other
side
even
more
solemnly
and
at
more
awful
intervals
than
she
had
affected
so
that
we
lay
in
great
tribulation
till
the
dawning
of
the
day
afraid
that
i
had
still
been
too
slightly
obliging
and
that
i
run
the
risk
of
being
separated
from
her
i
studied
the
whole
day
on
the
most
becoming
way
of
conducting
myself
and
entered
on
several
most
amorous
resolutions
but
the
higher
my
resolves
were
the
more
pusillanimous
was
my
behaviour
when
put
to
the
test
i
durst
not
even
touch
the
side
of
her
bed
that
night
but
the
wicked
unsonsy
bogle
still
continued
its
scratchings
sometimes
on
the
one
side
of
the
bed
and
sometimes
on
the
other
i
was
therefore
obliged
once
more
to
sit
down
on
her
bed
side
to
guard
her
from
its
inroads
in
sitting
there
i
dropt
asleep
and
my
head
fell
down
on
her
pillow
it
was
impossible
i
could
help
that
and
then
she
kindly
laid
the
uppermost
coverlet
over
me
for
fear
of
my
catching
cold
but
i
was
by
far
too
sound
asleep
to
perceive
it
she
had
to
pull
the
covering
from
below
me
in
order
that
she
might
lay
it
above
me
for
all
that
i
did
not
awake
which
was
a
great
pity
but
always
as
she
made
the
greatest
stir
i
sniffed
the
louder
a
while
after
i
turned
myself
about
and
gave
my
head
a
ketch
toward
the
back
of
the
bed
till
my
cheek
came
in
contact
with
something
soft
but
it
was
in
my
sleep
and
i
was
in
one
so
so
profound
that
i
could
not
possibly
know
what
that
thing
was
what
a
fright
i
got
next
morning
on
perceiving
my
situation
i
sprung
from
the
bed
and
ran
away
to
the
hills
to
my
charge
without
speaking
a
word
i
was
however
quite
intoxicated
with
delight
and
endeavoured
to
ingratiate
myself
with
my
master
by
paying
every
possible
attention
to
his
behests
lest
i
should
lose
so
delightful
a
place
both
for
stolen
meat
and
approaching
pleasures
which
i
perceived
would
still
grow
more
and
more
sublime
and
was
glad
when
he
said
to
me
one
day
that
kell
had
given
over
complaining
of
my
rudeness
and
incivility
and
he
would
trust
me
as
her
companion
for
a
little
while
longer
in
the
mean
while
i
was
to
take
care
and
do
nothing
improper
but
he
had
such
trust
to
put
in
me
he
was
not
afraid
of
that
he
was
informed
every
day
by
this
subservient
beauty
how
matters
proceeded
so
he
let
them
go
on
by
degrees
till
they
arrived
at
such
a
crisis
as
he
desired
which
was
no
more
than
a
boy
lying
on
a
with
his
clothes
on
he
then
came
up
with
a
light
one
night
at
midnight
to
see
how
his
child
was
resting
pretending
that
he
thought
her
ill
and
found
me
lying
sound
asleep
where
perhaps
i
should
not
have
been
though
i
was
as
innocent
and
as
free
of
his
mistress
as
the
child
that
lay
in
her
bosom
he
was
in
great
wrath
and
pulled
me
over
the
bed
giving
me
two
or
three
gentle
thwacks
with
his
open
hand
he
also
rebuked
her
very
sharply
but
said
to
us
before
going
away
keep
your
own
secret
for
both
your
sakes
i
will
conceal
what
i
have
seen
although
you
have
acted
so
improperly
but
let
me
never
catch
you
in
the
like
fault
again
if
the
church
get
hold
of
you
you
are
both
undone
i
was
dreadfully
ashamed
and
felt
my
heart
quite
reckless
and
desperate
disregardful
of
all
danger
or
propriety
and
my
master
made
me
still
worse
by
telling
me
that
i
was
to
part
from
kell
in
a
few
days
but
that
he
did
not
like
to
put
me
away
just
then
for
fear
of
awakening
suspicions
against
us
for
he
had
a
great
regard
for
us
both
i
laid
all
these
things
to
heart
and
could
not
then
have
staid
from
kell
a
night
if
my
head
had
been
to
answer
for
it
next
day
one
night
we
were
informed
that
some
strangers
had
come
to
the
house
and
were
making
merry
and
before
we
went
to
bed
our
master
sent
us
something
to
eat
and
drink
i
thought
there
was
something
going
on
that
night
for
i
heard
a
great
deal
of
muttering
and
saying
of
paternosters
till
a
late
hour
however
i
took
up
my
old
birth
and
after
a
while
fell
sound
asleep
about
midnight
we
were
awaked
by
four
or
five
gruff
looking
fellows
with
long
beards
and
staves
in
their
hands
who
ordered
us
both
to
get
up
and
dress
ourselves
our
master
made
a
speech
to
them
lamenting
our
guilt
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
beseeching
their
clemency
toward
us
but
at
the
same
time
said
that
he
could
not
suffer
such
immoralities
under
his
roof
he
had
a
family
of
his
own
coming
up
and
bad
example
was
pernicious
then
he
related
what
strict
injunctions
he
had
given
us
yet
we
had
continued
to
persist
in
our
wicked
unlawful
courses
that
therefore
he
had
been
obliged
to
give
us
up
as
lawless
and
irreclaimable
delinquents
all
that
he
could
now
do
was
to
intreat
theirs
and
the
holy
merciful
clemency
towards
the
youthful
offenders
for
that
although
we
had
both
mocked
and
set
at
defiance
the
statutes
of
holy
church
he
had
hopes
of
our
repentance
and
amendment
and
with
that
he
delivered
us
over
to
the
officers
of
the
church
whom
he
had
trysted
and
suborned
for
that
purpose
they
said
he
was
a
good
man
but
that
the
offenders
must
needs
suffer
a
heavy
penance
in
order
that
they
might
be
again
rendered
pure
and
without
blame
in
the
eyes
of
their
fostering
and
protecting
parent
when
kell
saw
that
she
was
betrayed
and
abandoned
her
grief
and
despair
knew
no
bounds
and
she
would
doubtless
have
accused
her
master
to
his
face
had
she
been
able
to
articulate
aught
distinctly
but
she
fell
into
fits
and
they
hurried
her
away
we
were
confined
to
cells
in
different
religious
houses
but
both
in
the
same
ward
it
is
well
known
what
tyranny
prevails
here
and
what
vengeance
is
wreaked
against
all
those
guilty
of
breaches
of
morality
especially
if
those
possessed
of
riches
or
power
desire
it
but
it
is
nothing
to
that
which
predominates
over
the
west
country
where
i
then
was
they
fed
me
on
bread
and
water
though
i
asked
for
fat
flesh
and
longed
for
it
every
hour
of
the
day
and
always
when
the
people
assembled
to
worship
i
was
put
in
the
juggs
that
is
i
was
chained
to
the
kirk
wall
with
an
iron
collar
about
my
neck
and
every
boy
brought
a
rotten
egg
or
some
filth
and
threw
at
me
till
i
was
all
over
bedaubed
and
plastered
like
a
rough
stone
wall
the
men
gave
me
a
kick
and
the
old
maids
spit
upon
me
as
they
passed
but
the
young
women
looked
on
me
with
pity
and
the
old
wives
before
my
time
of
penance
was
expired
espoused
my
cause
and
defended
me
from
the
rabble
i
heard
them
saying
to
one
another
poor
fellow
somebody
may
be
the
better
o
him
yet
what
wad
the
mother
that
bore
him
say
if
she
saw
him
standing
in
that
guise
surely
she
wad
think
the
punishment
far
outwent
the
crime
one
day
just
when
i
was
about
to
be
set
at
liberty
i
saw
my
kind
master
speaking
to
some
of
the
holy
brethren
and
was
glad
when
i
saw
him
thinking
i
saw
the
face
of
the
only
man
on
earth
that
cared
for
me
but
he
came
with
a
different
intent
from
what
i
supposed
namely
with
the
benevolent
one
of
getting
me
hanged
he
said
he
had
missed
some
money
out
of
his
house
ever
since
i
came
away
and
though
he
should
be
sorry
indeed
to
find
any
part
of
it
on
me
for
his
own
satisfaction
he
requested
to
search
my
clothes
in
their
presence
to
which
i
submitted
without
reluctance
being
conscious
of
my
innocence
but
he
that
hides
knows
best
where
to
seek
it
was
not
long
before
my
kind
master
took
out
from
between
several
of
the
in
the
breast
of
my
grey
coat
two
gold
moudiwarts
three
silver
merks
and
several
placks
and
bodles
in
vain
did
i
protest
that
i
knew
nothing
about
them
the
brethren
pronounced
me
the
most
incorrigible
wretch
and
vagabond
that
traversed
the
face
of
the
earth
and
as
their
jurisdiction
extended
not
to
such
crimes
as
this
they
sent
me
off
with
the
proofs
of
my
guilt
to
lord
william
for
judgment
and
execution
i
shall
never
forget
the
figure
i
cut
that
day
when
brought
before
lord
william
and
accused
i
was
in
a
wretched
state
as
to
clothes
having
stood
so
long
in
the
juggs
i
had
been
hungered
almost
to
death
and
maltreated
in
every
way
and
altogether
looked
extremely
ill
he
asked
them
to
go
over
the
charges
against
me
when
one
of
the
brethren
came
forward
and
spoke
to
him
as
follows
my
noble
lord
and
benefactor
a
worthy
gentleman
within
our
bounds
of
censure
and
controul
lodged
a
complaint
with
us
against
two
of
his
servants
that
had
been
tempted
by
the
devil
to
fall
into
lawless
and
sinful
communication
and
notwithstanding
of
all
his
admonitions
and
threatenings
of
church
discipline
they
not
only
continued
in
their
but
every
day
grew
worse
and
more
abandoned
he
therefore
prayed
us
to
take
cognizance
of
the
offence
which
for
the
sake
of
their
souls
and
the
general
benefit
of
our
community
we
undertook
accordingly
my
lord
as
he
suggested
we
went
disguised
as
strangers
and
at
midnight
we
found
this
same
young
gentleman
lying
snugly
in
bed
beside
our
friend
principal
the
very
maiden
to
whom
he
had
entrusted
the
care
of
his
children
one
of
whom
lay
in
the
bed
with
them
think
of
the
atrocity
of
this
my
lord
and
look
at
the
man
the
judge
did
so
and
could
not
help
smiling
what
do
you
say
to
that
master
said
he
is
it
truth
yes
said
i
this
answer
made
him
burst
out
a
laughing
upon
my
word
said
he
you
are
a
most
extraordinary
youth
was
the
girl
pretty
say
you
monk
the
woman
was
indeed
very
beautiful
my
lord
she
has
been
blessed
however
with
a
singular
taste
i
think
the
stripling
may
almost
be
excused
for
this
crime
the
monk
then
related
the
circumstances
of
the
stolen
money
having
been
found
on
me
at
which
the
judge
shook
his
head
and
said
alak
it
is
all
over
with
him
he
is
unfit
to
live
what
do
you
say
to
this
sirrah
is
it
true
yes
said
i
true
that
you
stole
your
master
money
said
he
no
i
never
stole
it
but
it
is
true
that
it
was
there
what
you
found
it
i
suppose
tell
me
the
truth
did
not
you
find
it
no
i
never
found
it
nor
ever
saw
it
till
it
was
taken
out
of
my
coat
yesterday
i
never
had
either
gold
or
silver
in
my
hand
in
my
life
your
woman
took
it
and
sewed
it
in
for
you
then
i
suppose
i
do
not
know
who
took
it
or
how
it
came
there
but
there
it
certainly
was
did
you
ever
part
with
your
coat
to
your
sweetheart
did
you
ever
lend
her
it
to
mend
or
leave
it
at
home
with
her
i
have
often
on
warm
weather
left
my
coat
at
home
for
three
or
four
days
rinning
but
you
declare
you
did
not
take
the
money
i
never
saw
the
money
nor
heard
of
it
till
yesterday
when
i
said
this
he
looked
stedfastly
on
me
as
if
he
had
discovered
something
he
saw
not
before
there
was
no
man
on
earth
could
discover
truth
like
lord
william
who
is
this
youth
accuser
said
he
they
told
him
it
was
sleeky
tam
i
have
observed
of
late
said
he
that
that
gentleman
never
searches
that
he
does
not
find
and
never
accuses
that
he
does
not
bring
proof
i
have
caused
several
to
be
executed
on
the
evidences
raised
by
him
and
have
always
remarked
that
he
is
the
only
profiter
by
their
being
put
down
we
must
move
with
more
caution
let
that
wench
be
brought
before
me
and
stop
the
execution
of
jock
sandy
whom
i
ordered
to
be
hanged
my
late
benevolent
master
was
watching
the
course
of
these
events
with
punctuality
and
was
terribly
chagrined
when
he
heard
that
his
neighbour
jock
sandy
was
reprieved
he
was
almost
beside
himself
but
having
great
influence
with
the
holy
brethren
he
persuaded
them
to
retain
kell
under
their
jurisdiction
and
not
give
her
up
to
lord
william
in
the
course
of
his
scrutiny
he
had
likewise
discovered
some
of
his
gold
pieces
on
her
and
had
doomed
her
to
destruction
with
the
rest
yet
at
the
same
time
he
told
the
holy
fathers
to
be
lenient
and
altogether
to
overlook
that
fault
which
had
originated
from
the
first
and
that
was
one
to
which
youth
was
liable
he
conjured
them
not
to
give
her
up
to
william
the
severe
who
would
infallibly
doom
her
to
an
ignominous
death
if
she
had
deserved
that
he
said
it
was
much
better
that
she
should
die
privately
in
which
case
he
would
pay
seventy
merks
annually
to
the
church
for
the
securing
of
her
soul
he
was
frightened
for
the
meeting
of
so
many
criminals
before
lord
william
wicked
as
we
were
and
so
high
was
the
influence
of
the
convent
of
which
this
was
a
branch
that
the
brethren
refused
to
give
up
the
offender
to
lord
officers
after
my
first
examination
was
over
i
was
thrust
into
a
dungeon
beside
jock
sandy
who
had
been
cast
to
die
for
stealing
the
ox
which
i
myself
slew
and
when
we
began
to
converse
freely
together
what
a
tissue
of
deceit
was
unraveled
he
asked
me
if
i
knew
any
thing
about
that
ox
for
which
he
was
to
lose
his
life
i
said
i
knew
very
well
about
the
ox
for
i
had
killed
him
myself
and
what
a
great
fool
you
were
said
i
to
incur
so
much
danger
for
the
sake
of
a
nout
hide
and
a
pair
of
horns
for
these
you
certainly
did
steal
the
man
was
perfectly
amazed
when
i
told
him
all
the
truth
and
promised
to
procure
me
as
much
fat
flesh
as
i
could
eat
every
day
if
i
would
tell
the
truth
of
the
story
to
lord
william
i
catched
at
the
offer
for
i
had
suffered
so
much
in
my
stomach
of
late
that
i
would
have
done
far
more
than
he
required
of
me
for
such
an
advantage
indeed
i
would
have
done
any
thing
or
said
any
thing
in
the
world
that
i
might
once
more
enjoy
my
beloved
mess
he
proved
as
good
as
his
word
for
before
night
the
keeper
brought
me
a
whole
apron
full
of
bits
and
scraps
of
the
fattest
meat
that
i
ever
saw
beef
mutton
and
pork
there
were
some
square
pieces
of
perfect
pure
white
fat
that
i
sliced
down
like
cheese
they
were
from
the
flanks
of
fat
beeves
the
briskets
of
wedders
and
the
ribs
of
fatted
hogs
and
i
could
not
but
admire
the
want
of
good
taste
among
the
gentles
who
had
left
these
savoury
bits
to
their
slaves
and
prisoners
i
was
so
delighted
that
i
could
not
sleep
by
night
but
always
awakened
from
my
straw
and
fell
i
wish
we
saw
such
a
feast
again
but
indeed
i
saw
nothing
for
our
house
was
in
utter
darkness
but
it
was
a
good
and
i
could
have
been
content
to
have
lived
in
it
all
my
life
in
a
few
days
i
was
once
more
carried
above
ground
for
examination
where
i
told
the
whole
truth
boldly
but
was
not
believed
no
one
would
give
credit
to
the
tale
that
i
had
slain
one
of
my
master
fattest
oxen
for
the
sake
of
good
cheer
such
a
thing
they
said
would
never
come
into
a
stripling
head
and
i
had
been
suborned
to
my
evidence
by
my
fellow
prisoner
lord
william
asked
if
there
was
any
proof
remaining
that
i
could
produce
in
support
of
my
assertion
i
said
i
had
a
part
of
the
beef
remaining
well
salted
up
in
a
barrel
below
ground
and
covered
with
a
moss
divot
and
that
i
had
likewise
some
hid
for
fresh
meat
in
some
cold
well
springs
and
i
would
shew
them
these
if
they
liked
i
was
sent
with
a
guard
and
shewed
them
the
remains
of
my
ox
and
when
this
was
reported
to
lord
william
he
called
me
a
rogue
and
a
glutton
and
caused
them
to
tie
a
rope
about
my
neck
and
lead
me
through
the
streets
of
the
town
naked
lashing
me
with
a
whip
all
the
way
he
then
bade
me
make
off
with
myself
for
if
i
was
found
within
twenty
miles
of
that
place
where
i
stood
he
would
cause
me
to
be
hewed
in
pieces
my
late
master
was
taken
up
and
examined
face
to
face
with
those
he
had
accused
but
how
he
contrived
to
elude
justice
i
never
knew
ten
years
after
one
informed
me
that
the
dame
kelly
had
accused
him
before
lord
william
of
having
seduced
her
and
that
in
the
most
disgraceful
way
and
then
of
forcing
me
into
the
situation
in
which
i
was
caught
for
a
screen
to
his
own
guilt
and
shame
for
all
that
it
seems
poor
kell
was
returned
to
the
convent
and
never
more
heard
of
and
sleeky
tam
possesses
both
his
own
and
his
neighbour
farm
at
this
day
i
had
begun
to
think
that
ill
deeds
throve
best
but
i
now
conceived
that
i
had
paid
very
dearly
indeed
for
my
late
pleasures
of
feasting
and
love
being
almost
flayed
alive
i
cried
bitterly
as
i
fled
and
cursed
lord
william
and
his
raggamuffians
that
had
scourged
me
and
vowed
to
myself
if
i
lived
to
be
a
man
that
i
would
be
revenged
on
them
i
likewise
cursed
my
deceitful
master
but
i
did
not
curse
poor
kell
indeed
i
found
that
it
was
for
her
i
wept
most
bitterly
thinking
myself
the
cause
of
all
her
shame
and
suffering
i
fled
next
into
a
country
called
galloway
a
place
which
some
of
you
may
have
heard
of
by
chance
but
i
found
it
the
worst
meat
country
and
the
worst
country
altogether
that
i
had
ever
seen
i
lived
there
for
a
number
of
years
leading
a
sort
of
vagabond
life
but
quite
an
honourable
one
i
learned
naturally
among
them
to
be
a
great
thief
and
an
acute
liar
but
i
never
stole
any
thing
but
fat
flesh
nor
do
i
account
any
thing
else
worthy
of
running
the
risk
for
from
that
no
danger
ever
could
or
ever
shall
debar
me
i
care
not
much
what
sort
it
be
provided
it
be
juicy
and
a
layer
of
white
next
the
bone
i
wonder
whether
men
flesh
is
likest
to
beef
or
mutton
or
venison
i
wish
ye
wadna
always
turn
your
green
een
on
me
that
gate
when
you
speak
about
your
fat
flesh
said
gibbie
i
assure
you
mine
is
neither
like
beef
nor
mutton
nor
venison
and
what
is
more
you
shall
never
taste
it
i
appeal
to
you
all
masters
and
friends
if
this
man
has
not
fairly
fallen
through
his
tale
i
suppose
it
must
be
very
like
veal
then
continued
tam
and
if
so
i
have
seen
a
joint
of
cold
veal
very
excellent
meat
more
especially
that
adjoining
the
white
gristly
part
with
a
little
salt
a
man
can
eat
a
great
deal
of
that
without
being
any
thing
the
worse
my
masters
i
do
protest
against
these
carnivorous
looks
of
the
rejoined
gibbie
they
make
ane
feel
so
queerly
it
is
as
if
he
were
tearing
my
flesh
quick
from
the
banes
with
his
teeth
and
i
call
you
to
note
that
he
has
sticked
a
story
which
from
the
beginning
is
no
story
stay
till
it
be
done
an
you
please
said
tam
the
best
of
my
tale
is
yet
to
come
and
any
man
may
be
allowed
a
breathing
space
and
a
little
refreshment
at
i
fell
in
with
an
old
man
called
the
gorb
an
itinerant
fencer
who
travelled
the
country
teaching
the
art
of
the
sword
to
him
i
attached
myself
somewhat
against
his
will
for
i
saw
that
though
he
was
not
everywhere
a
welcome
guest
he
was
nevertheless
a
privileged
one
and
always
admitted
he
was
six
feet
high
with
a
beard
that
hung
to
his
middle
and
his
frame
was
entirely
composed
of
bones
and
sinews
the
feats
that
he
described
to
me
of
warrior
prowess
first
raised
in
me
a
desire
to
learn
his
noble
art
and
as
soon
as
i
began
to
manifest
a
partiality
for
his
profession
he
began
to
attach
himself
to
me
but
in
a
manner
so
ungracious
that
if
i
had
not
been
a
being
quite
desperate
i
never
could
have
borne
it
we
moved
on
from
place
to
place
the
young
men
of
the
country
assembled
in
parties
as
we
passed
to
attend
his
lessons
and
at
night
we
had
wherever
we
went
that
is
the
gorb
was
a
free
man
but
many
pointed
inuendos
were
thrown
out
against
my
introduction
as
an
additional
burden
these
people
had
better
have
let
the
matter
pass
over
for
he
did
not
fail
to
pay
them
back
with
interest
in
bitter
and
sarcastic
retorts
on
some
of
these
occasions
he
gave
me
a
terrible
character
of
the
country
and
its
inhabitants
you
are
come
poor
man
to
sojourn
in
the
worst
country
under
the
cope
of
heaven
said
he
into
a
place
where
there
is
no
faith
no
honour
no
money
and
very
little
meat
what
do
they
live
on
in
general
said
i
on
some
wretched
roots
pulse
and
black
corn
said
he
some
lean
unhealthy
fish
and
still
more
lean
and
sapless
cattle
i
like
the
country
a
great
deal
the
worse
said
i
is
the
flesh
here
so
very
lean
why
ask
said
he
have
you
not
witnessed
it
no
i
am
very
sorry
i
have
not
said
i
i
supposed
it
had
been
lent
in
this
country
as
for
their
faith
or
honour
i
care
not
a
pin
their
money
is
of
little
avail
to
me
but
i
hate
to
stay
in
a
country
where
there
is
no
meat
and
how
they
can
transact
business
without
money
is
beyond
my
comprehension
they
have
none
however
said
he
nor
was
there
ever
any
in
this
country
they
transact
all
their
business
on
a
thing
called
credit
which
commonly
attaches
itself
to
a
man
for
a
number
of
years
sometimes
for
a
long
and
sometimes
a
very
short
term
this
enables
him
to
cheat
his
neighbours
for
a
time
and
all
his
exertions
tend
only
to
this
namely
how
many
he
can
take
in
and
to
what
amount
and
when
he
has
gone
as
far
as
this
ideal
quality
of
his
can
carry
him
he
takes
to
the
bent
and
leaves
them
all
in
the
lurch
this
is
the
exact
state
of
this
blessed
country
called
galloway
and
will
be
its
state
as
long
as
it
continues
to
exist
the
only
rational
hope
concerning
it
is
that
as
it
is
a
sort
of
of
the
creation
it
will
perhaps
sink
in
the
ocean
and
mankind
will
be
rid
of
it
he
then
took
a
hearty
fiendish
laugh
at
the
conceit
of
the
country
being
sunk
and
went
after
all
i
can
not
help
being
amazed
at
the
rascally
crew
do
not
you
see
how
suspicion
and
distrust
are
stamped
on
every
countenance
every
man
makes
a
bargain
with
apparent
reluctance
and
with
a
dread
that
his
neighbour
is
going
to
cheat
him
and
he
is
never
mistaken
such
is
the
country
and
such
are
the
people
to
whom
you
have
now
come
and
such
must
they
ever
continue
to
remain
it
is
in
their
nature
to
be
so
and
they
can
not
be
otherwise
here
am
i
their
master
and
benefactor
who
have
spent
my
life
in
teaching
them
the
noblest
of
all
sciences
without
which
they
could
not
have
defended
their
country
i
have
taught
every
chief
in
the
country
and
every
one
of
their
vassals
and
how
am
i
requited
worse
fed
and
not
a
bodle
in
my
purse
all
my
recompense
is
the
freedom
of
living
a
life
of
fatigue
and
wretchedness
i
will
not
stay
another
night
in
the
country
of
such
a
parcel
of
rogues
said
i
you
are
wrong
answered
he
it
is
the
best
country
you
can
be
in
you
have
nothing
to
lose
and
you
may
gain
much
experience
is
a
greatest
riches
and
of
that
you
will
gain
abundance
you
will
here
learn
hourly
how
to
oppose
cunning
to
cunning
and
i
will
teach
you
the
noble
art
of
opposing
masterly
skill
to
brutal
force
until
you
may
haply
be
established
as
my
assistant
and
successor
i
would
rather
dispense
with
the
honour
said
i
you
are
too
lean
for
me
to
think
of
being
your
successor
were
you
a
fat
man
i
would
not
say
what
i
might
do
to
attain
the
distinction
but
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
one
thing
which
is
always
to
have
my
meat
honestly
if
i
can
but
at
all
events
to
have
it
you
are
so
far
right
in
your
principle
said
he
for
when
we
consider
of
it
a
man
can
have
very
little
more
than
his
meat
in
this
world
for
all
the
struggling
and
strife
there
is
in
it
but
since
you
set
so
high
a
value
on
good
living
i
can
if
i
please
assist
you
to
it
for
poor
and
wretched
as
i
appear
and
as
i
am
i
have
a
right
to
call
for
and
command
the
best
in
every
house
i
could
likewise
take
their
clothes
for
money
they
have
none
but
it
would
be
like
tearing
the
hearts
out
of
the
dogs
so
i
content
myself
with
the
meanest
fare
rather
than
humble
myself
to
ask
ought
of
them
you
are
an
extraordinary
man
said
i
but
when
i
look
at
you
i
can
not
conceive
this
privilege
of
yours
to
exist
in
aught
but
in
theory
you
shall
see
said
he
what
sort
of
meat
would
you
prefer
fat
flesh
at
all
times
and
all
seasons
said
i
there
is
nothing
like
that
whether
it
be
the
flesh
of
bullock
hog
or
wedder
the
fattest
is
always
the
best
what
a
kite
what
a
raven
what
a
dog
exclaimed
he
well
you
shall
have
it
if
it
were
but
to
kill
you
of
a
surfeit
we
were
lying
in
a
barn
when
this
discourse
occurred
and
i
could
not
but
wonder
what
the
old
fellow
would
do
it
was
customary
for
us
to
take
our
breakfast
at
the
place
where
we
lodged
and
if
i
might
judge
from
our
supper
the
place
where
we
then
were
gave
no
prospect
of
very
rich
fare
the
breakfast
was
produced
a
quantity
of
black
brochen
and
lentiles
the
master
of
defence
wist
not
how
to
break
the
ice
by
introducing
a
refusal
of
the
proffered
meal
but
he
considered
himself
as
pledged
to
me
and
his
haughty
spirit
would
not
succumb
his
looks
were
particularly
embarrassed
and
amusing
and
i
saw
that
he
would
gladly
have
been
free
of
his
engagement
as
he
began
a
long
palaver
of
general
remarks
i
kept
up
my
good
hopes
and
gave
him
always
an
expecting
look
now
and
then
to
make
him
hold
to
his
resolution
the
people
of
the
house
paid
little
attention
to
his
harangue
till
at
length
he
concluded
with
these
words
such
being
the
case
and
such
the
state
of
the
country
i
am
obliged
now
to
claim
all
my
rights
privileges
and
dues
from
every
vassal
of
my
lord
of
galloway
as
well
as
from
every
subject
of
our
liege
lord
the
king
whose
commission
i
bear
goodman
latchie
i
accept
no
more
of
black
croudy
and
lentiles
for
breakfast
i
claim
order
and
command
the
best
that
is
in
this
house
in
place
of
that
hog
meat
let
us
have
a
rasher
on
the
coals
if
you
so
please
the
muckle
fiend
be
atween
your
teeth
then
to
choak
you
wi
the
first
bite
said
the
goodwife
farmer
latchie
i
contend
not
with
women
said
the
man
of
the
sword
are
you
aware
of
my
rights
or
do
you
know
and
dispute
them
i
consider
yours
as
merely
a
nominal
right
said
he
which
no
man
is
bound
to
fulfil
because
no
man
does
it
all
my
lord
vassals
treat
you
with
common
fare
why
should
i
do
more
with
that
a
young
man
stepped
forward
with
a
black
beard
and
a
ruffian
look
he
was
the
farmer
eldest
son
and
his
name
was
john
what
is
all
this
din
about
said
he
let
me
speak
will
ye
master
gorb
either
take
that
which
is
set
before
you
or
go
away
without
it
i
say
that
you
say
that
do
you
sir
said
my
master
yes
sure
i
do
said
he
i
says
that
and
i
say
it
again
too
to
be
sure
i
will
then
there
is
my
gage
sir
do
you
know
to
what
you
have
subjected
yourself
said
my
master
pulling
out
his
sword
and
laying
it
on
the
board
you
have
given
the
king
ordained
swordsman
the
denial
you
must
fight
him
or
find
one
on
the
instant
to
do
it
for
you
if
he
kills
you
he
is
entitled
to
take
off
your
head
and
send
it
to
the
king
and
if
you
kill
him
you
lose
your
head
and
all
the
goods
and
chattels
of
your
house
are
to
be
confiscate
rescue
or
no
rescue
draw
craven
or
yield
me
up
the
keys
of
your
pantry
your
chest
and
your
sunken
cellar
you
dog
i
does
nae
see
the
sense
o
that
master
gorb
said
john
with
a
countenance
right
sorely
altered
that
a
man
maunna
say
his
awn
his
awn
or
what
his
father
is
his
father
but
that
he
maun
tak
up
sword
and
swordsman
i
does
nae
fear
thee
it
no
to
say
that
i
fears
thee
but
i
winna
be
bullied
intil
aught
and
i
just
tells
thee
that
i
neither
fight
thee
nor
suffer
thee
to
get
a
scrap
o
aught
better
than
is
set
afore
thee
and
gang
and
seek
thy
mends
now
i
says
that
thou
art
a
craven
and
a
nincompoop
said
my
master
with
the
highest
indignation
and
i
lift
my
pledge
and
will
report
thee
to
thy
betters
do
if
thou
mayest
cried
old
latchie
running
to
an
armour
chest
and
taking
from
thence
a
sword
and
buckler
disgrace
of
my
house
to
give
the
challenge
and
then
to
flinch
have
with
thee
bellwether
i
will
give
you
to
know
that
old
masons
are
the
best
barrowmen
i
ground
my
pledge
again
and
i
take
thee
said
my
master
but
now
the
old
woman
came
running
between
them
crying
out
deil
be
i
your
teeth
deil
be
i
your
teeth
tak
a
that
i
the
house
an
haud
you
there
are
the
keys
there
are
the
keys
deil
be
i
your
teeth
take
a
and
let
us
alane
o
your
din
the
gorb
waved
the
keys
aside
with
his
arm
in
high
indignation
but
the
wife
clung
to
her
point
i
take
you
a
witnesses
cried
she
i
take
you
a
witnesses
i
have
offered
him
the
keys
and
he
has
refused
them
here
young
gorb
young
take
ye
them
take
ye
them
deil
be
i
your
teeth
take
a
that
i
the
house
i
took
the
keys
lest
they
should
be
forgot
in
the
hurry
the
two
old
fellows
took
to
the
field
with
sword
and
buckler
while
both
the
old
dame
and
her
son
john
strove
to
interfere
but
the
old
yeoman
silenced
them
both
with
a
word
and
i
thought
he
would
have
struck
his
son
down
with
the
sword
so
much
was
he
enraged
at
his
behaviour
i
had
seen
much
sword
play
by
this
time
in
the
way
of
amusement
or
but
i
had
never
seen
two
men
meet
in
deadly
foil
and
i
trembled
for
the
event
for
i
judged
that
if
the
old
gorb
was
killed
it
would
fare
hardly
with
me
being
conscious
that
i
was
the
moving
cause
of
the
combat
my
master
demeanour
was
altogether
inimitable
he
went
through
every
thing
as
if
it
had
been
a
matter
of
mere
ceremony
first
slipping
gracefully
to
one
side
crossing
his
hands
on
his
breast
bowing
profoundly
and
then
shaking
hands
with
latchie
then
swimming
gracefully
to
the
other
side
and
repeating
the
same
manoeuvre
last
of
all
he
wheeled
about
cut
some
wild
flourishes
with
his
sword
and
took
his
distance
the
yeoman
bit
his
lip
and
appeared
to
be
viewing
all
these
things
with
disdain
but
he
set
himself
firm
on
his
legs
with
his
left
foot
foremost
and
setting
up
his
broad
bonnet
before
waited
the
onset
the
gorb
on
the
contrary
advanced
with
his
right
foot
foremost
and
instead
of
availing
himself
of
the
buckler
as
the
former
did
he
came
forward
bearing
it
up
behind
him
as
high
as
his
head
he
seemed
to
wear
it
merely
because
the
other
did
but
he
was
too
proud
to
make
any
use
of
it
nothing
ever
did
or
ever
will
exceed
the
singularity
of
that
combat
the
figures
of
the
men
and
their
manner
of
fighting
being
so
different
latchie
was
short
and
squat
the
gorb
somewhat
like
the
skeleton
of
a
giant
the
art
of
fighting
which
the
former
pursued
was
to
shield
himself
behind
his
broad
buckler
peep
over
it
and
now
and
then
make
dreadful
blows
around
it
with
the
full
swing
of
his
body
as
if
he
meant
to
cut
my
master
through
the
middle
or
shear
off
both
his
thighs
on
such
occasions
the
gorb
beside
parrying
the
stroke
made
such
tremendous
springs
off
at
a
side
that
he
rather
appeared
like
a
spirit
than
any
thing
of
bones
sinews
and
blood
for
as
to
flesh
there
was
none
on
him
and
at
every
one
of
these
leaps
he
uttered
a
loud
hoh
as
if
he
had
been
mortally
wounded
or
in
great
danger
of
having
been
so
yet
all
the
while
his
face
was
so
sublimely
grave
and
serious
as
if
every
movement
were
to
have
been
his
last
he
never
attempted
to
hit
the
yeoman
and
had
apparently
no
other
aim
in
fighting
than
merely
to
show
his
dexterity
in
fencing
retreating
and
advancing
i
deemed
that
all
was
over
with
him
and
began
to
be
mortally
afraid
of
myself
and
any
man
would
have
acknowledged
what
good
reason
i
had
if
he
had
witnessed
with
what
looks
the
wife
and
son
regarded
me
every
one
of
them
thought
the
gorb
had
the
worst
of
it
and
that
the
farmer
was
sure
of
the
day
indeed
by
this
time
there
was
little
doubt
of
it
the
old
wife
thrice
clapped
her
hands
and
screamed
out
weel
proven
goodman
that
gars
him
scamper
weel
proven
daniel
maclatchie
lie
to
the
breastleather
at
these
words
i
began
to
look
over
my
shoulder
and
meditate
a
most
strenuous
flight
but
now
the
most
novel
scene
of
all
occurred
my
master
still
continued
to
change
his
ground
and
to
skip
and
fly
about
until
at
length
the
yeoman
encouraged
by
his
wife
words
came
hard
upon
him
and
heaving
up
his
shield
a
little
he
came
with
a
deadly
stroke
round
below
it
ettling
to
cut
off
both
my
master
legs
hoh
cried
the
gorb
as
loud
as
he
could
vociferate
and
as
the
little
squat
yeoman
stooped
to
the
stroke
he
made
such
a
spring
into
the
air
that
he
leaped
fairly
over
his
head
and
as
he
passed
like
a
meteor
over
above
him
he
gave
him
such
a
slap
with
the
broad
side
of
his
sword
on
the
hind
cants
of
the
head
that
it
made
the
farmer
run
forward
and
fall
with
his
nose
on
the
ground
he
was
again
on
his
feet
however
in
an
instant
and
faced
about
while
his
eyes
streamed
with
water
from
the
sharpness
of
the
stroke
this
feat
astonished
the
latchies
but
the
wife
cried
out
a
barley
a
barley
foul
play
he
fighting
on
springs
emblem
true
of
thy
accursed
country
cried
the
gorb
and
kicking
off
his
sandals
at
her
head
he
took
his
ground
on
his
bare
soles
the
combatants
set
to
it
again
but
the
yeoman
was
now
on
his
guard
and
fought
shy
standing
on
the
defensive
my
master
soon
grew
tired
of
this
way
of
fighting
and
after
two
or
three
flying
feints
at
an
attack
in
a
moment
he
wrenched
latchie
sword
from
his
grasp
and
threw
it
into
the
air
like
a
the
lookers
on
gazed
in
amazement
and
the
astonished
yeoman
traced
the
course
of
his
erratic
weapon
which
after
forming
an
arch
like
a
rainbow
lighted
at
the
distance
of
forty
yards
john
the
farmer
son
was
the
first
who
ventured
a
remark
on
the
phenomenon
which
he
did
with
his
accustomed
shrewdness
and
in
the
cumberland
brogue
which
he
had
learned
by
living
some
years
in
that
district
feyther
i
thinks
thou
hast
thrown
away
thee
swoard
ay
said
his
father
biting
his
lip
and
looking
after
it
by
this
time
the
gorb
had
his
sword
at
latchie
throat
crying
rescue
or
no
rescue
i
say
yield
traitor
or
die
latchie
paid
no
regard
to
him
he
only
bit
his
lip
looked
after
his
sword
and
stood
his
ground
firm
without
moving
showing
a
most
unyielding
and
dauntless
spirit
the
gorb
repeated
his
threat
but
the
yeoman
paid
no
further
attention
to
it
than
before
what
an
unlucky
accident
said
he
had
i
not
thrown
away
my
sword
i
would
have
humbled
you
do
you
regret
the
loss
of
your
sword
so
much
said
the
gorb
will
you
promise
on
the
honour
of
a
good
yeoman
not
to
throw
it
away
in
like
manner
again
promise
said
the
other
i
will
swear
on
it
and
by
it
never
to
part
with
it
in
like
manner
again
young
man
said
my
master
to
me
run
and
bring
me
this
brave
sword
i
brought
it
and
he
took
it
by
the
point
and
delivered
it
back
to
the
owner
with
all
manner
of
courtesy
latchie
took
it
in
his
hand
and
let
the
point
of
it
slant
towards
the
ground
in
token
of
submission
nay
nay
i
deliver
it
cried
my
master
i
would
not
see
such
a
man
show
fear
or
pusillanimity
for
any
thing
exchange
me
three
times
three
and
no
more
and
god
stand
by
the
right
i
counsel
thee
moreover
to
assume
thy
best
defence
as
i
propose
to
do
thee
all
manner
of
injury
so
be
it
i
defy
you
still
said
latchie
and
took
his
ground
a
second
time
his
wife
and
son
spoke
a
great
deal
by
way
of
interference
but
were
totally
disregarded
the
combat
began
again
with
more
fury
than
ever
but
at
the
second
or
third
time
of
crossing
their
weapons
daniel
maclatchie
sword
betook
itself
again
into
the
firmament
and
after
tracing
nearly
the
same
course
as
formerly
alighted
on
the
same
spot
you
are
the
devil
and
none
else
said
latchie
and
i
yield
to
my
conqueror
i
am
at
your
disposal
and
i
will
use
my
advantage
as
in
duty
and
in
honour
bound
said
the
gorb
rise
up
my
friend
and
brother
you
are
a
man
of
true
genuine
spirit
i
honour
you
and
i
estimate
your
country
more
this
morning
for
your
sake
than
i
have
hitherto
done
i
claim
your
friendship
as
a
brother
in
arms
you
shall
not
have
cause
to
repent
this
spirited
encounter
the
farmer
was
greatly
flattered
by
this
speech
i
gave
up
the
keys
and
there
was
no
end
of
kindness
and
endearment
between
the
two
old
fellows
we
had
our
rasher
on
the
coals
and
i
think
i
have
scarcely
risen
from
a
better
diet
than
i
did
that
day
i
got
the
greater
part
to
myself
for
the
rest
were
all
so
busy
talking
and
drinking
cold
ale
that
they
hardly
thought
of
the
bacon
it
was
nicely
toasted
and
the
fat
stood
on
it
like
small
drops
of
honey
but
i
must
not
dwell
on
the
recollection
else
i
shall
faint
at
our
meal
the
yeoman
offered
my
master
a
new
war
cloak
with
belts
bands
and
haversack
if
he
would
tell
him
by
what
means
he
disarmed
him
with
such
ease
and
in
so
extraordinary
a
manner
but
the
other
absolutely
refused
it
is
allowable
in
chivalry
said
he
to
learn
and
practice
any
mode
of
manual
defence
and
to
keep
that
mode
a
secret
till
you
prove
it
on
your
opponent
that
is
my
secret
and
by
that
mode
i
would
forfeit
my
life
nay
my
character
itself
to
disarm
any
man
that
ever
pointed
a
sword
at
my
breast
i
should
have
liked
very
much
to
have
known
that
secret
of
his
said
charlie
scott
i
found
it
out
privately
with
the
most
perfect
certainty
continued
tam
but
durst
never
let
him
know
that
i
understood
aught
of
the
matter
it
was
owing
to
his
sword
handle
which
was
made
for
the
purpose
it
had
an
inner
shell
of
steel
polished
like
glass
then
an
outer
one
of
formed
with
rounded
bars
in
such
a
manner
that
by
turning
his
hand
in
a
slight
degree
to
humour
the
position
of
the
sword
and
dashing
his
hilt
against
the
point
of
it
that
entered
between
those
of
the
and
running
up
the
polished
steel
within
bent
and
fixed
itself
then
by
a
sudden
wrench
against
his
opponent
thumb
of
which
he
was
a
perfect
master
he
not
only
disarmed
him
to
a
certainty
but
generally
left
his
arm
powerless
after
i
had
discovered
it
i
went
by
myself
to
try
the
experiment
fixed
my
own
sword
and
taking
my
master
in
my
hand
i
pushed
the
basket
of
that
slightly
against
the
point
of
the
other
and
behold
it
fixed
in
it
so
close
that
with
all
my
might
and
all
my
art
i
could
not
extricate
it
without
breaking
it
in
two
and
in
that
case
i
saw
i
would
leave
the
point
sticking
where
it
was
which
i
durst
not
do
for
my
life
at
length
it
came
into
my
head
to
do
as
my
master
did
this
had
the
effect
at
once
the
vibration
in
the
blade
caused
by
the
swing
and
jerk
made
it
loosen
and
it
flew
away
through
the
air
like
a
fiery
dragon
master
michael
scott
said
gibbie
and
my
friends
i
again
appeal
to
you
all
if
this
man
has
not
fallen
through
his
tale
it
is
turning
out
no
tale
at
all
but
merely
an
offputting
of
time
till
we
shall
all
perish
of
hunger
the
story
of
the
hapless
maiden
kell
and
of
our
hero
first
essays
in
love
i
did
admire
and
prize
said
the
poet
od
help
your
crazed
head
said
charlie
i
wadna
gie
that
duel
atween
the
twa
auld
chaps
for
a
creelfu
o
love
stories
lo
the
tale
is
good
said
the
friar
but
it
goeth
here
and
there
without
bound
or
limit
and
wherefore
should
not
a
man
relate
all
that
befalleth
unto
him
i
suppose
it
behoveth
our
friend
to
go
on
without
turning
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
my
tale
is
indeed
long
but
to
me
it
is
momentous
i
should
stop
here
pleasantly
but
life
is
sweet
and
to
give
me
a
fair
chance
for
mine
i
beg
to
be
permitted
to
relate
one
adventure
more
this
after
some
demur
was
granted
and
tam
went
on
after
spending
several
years
among
the
hills
of
galloway
and
being
approved
of
by
the
gorb
as
he
was
called
by
every
body
though
his
name
was
macdougald
for
a
good
swordsman
i
tired
of
the
country
being
persuaded
that
the
ground
did
not
fatten
the
cattle
properly
and
from
the
moment
i
began
to
suspect
that
i
had
no
more
satisfaction
in
the
place
but
utterly
despised
it
i
perceived
that
their
beef
was
never
above
an
inch
thick
in
the
ribs
and
what
was
worse
it
was
not
properly
mixed
with
white
layers
of
fat
even
the
doubles
in
the
broad
bone
of
the
shoulder
were
nothing
but
pure
red
lire
this
will
never
do
thought
i
how
i
despise
the
people
that
can
put
up
with
such
a
country
as
this
master
says
i
one
day
i
am
quite
tired
of
this
country
and
am
going
to
leave
it
wherefore
are
you
going
to
leave
it
thomas
have
not
i
been
better
and
kinder
to
you
than
to
myself
for
all
that
master
i
am
resolved
not
to
sojourn
another
week
in
it
i
warned
you
that
they
were
a
deceitful
people
before
said
he
but
we
must
take
them
as
they
are
we
can
not
make
mankind
as
we
would
wish
to
have
them
it
is
not
for
the
men
nor
for
the
women
either
that
i
dislike
the
country
so
much
said
i
what
is
it
then
for
said
he
it
is
said
i
because
i
suspect
that
their
grass
is
not
of
a
good
quality
i
will
never
forget
the
look
that
the
gorb
turned
on
me
he
was
walking
somewhat
before
me
but
when
he
heard
my
reason
for
disliking
galloway
he
wheeled
about
and
taking
one
of
his
most
striking
upright
positions
with
his
lean
shoulders
set
up
like
two
pins
he
stared
at
me
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
then
put
the
following
questions
to
me
at
long
intervals
grass
eh
how
do
you
mean
look
at
it
said
i
what
substance
is
in
that
wiry
stuff
and
on
these
hills
of
black
heather
the
gorb
jaws
fell
down
with
dismay
he
visibly
thought
that
i
was
deranged
but
he
answered
me
mildly
to
humour
my
malady
true
the
grass
is
not
good
it
never
was
and
never
will
be
so
but
i
have
not
observed
that
you
ever
eat
much
of
it
nor
can
i
see
how
a
man
happiness
any
way
depends
upon
the
quality
of
the
grass
of
a
country
if
that
be
all
the
sense
that
you
have
thought
i
i
will
disdain
for
my
part
to
exchange
another
word
with
you
on
the
subject
since
you
think
that
a
man
happiness
can
depend
on
thing
but
good
grass
you
shall
be
followed
no
longer
by
me
well
continued
he
after
waiting
a
while
for
an
answer
i
see
you
are
sulky
about
this
whim
but
i
will
humour
it
i
have
nearly
finished
my
terms
among
the
mountains
and
we
shall
descend
upon
the
shores
where
there
is
as
good
grass
as
any
in
scotland
and
i
promise
you
full
liberty
to
go
into
every
field
that
you
chuse
and
take
your
bellyful
of
it
i
have
likewise
many
things
to
teach
you
which
will
amuse
you
in
the
highest
degree
and
which
belong
to
the
sublime
art
of
legerdemain
what
is
that
said
i
it
is
the
art
said
he
that
enables
us
to
see
things
and
people
as
they
really
are
there
is
scarcely
any
thing
on
this
earth
really
what
it
appears
to
be
and
this
art
i
have
yet
to
teach
you
from
that
day
forward
he
began
and
performed
feats
that
entirely
bewildered
my
senses
but
which
furnished
wherever
we
were
a
great
fund
of
amusement
all
the
young
people
believed
him
to
be
in
compact
with
the
devil
i
have
forgot
them
all
but
one
which
i
will
remember
as
long
as
i
live
we
came
to
a
wealthy
yeoman
house
on
the
river
urr
where
we
were
to
remain
several
days
and
while
he
exercised
the
farmer
sons
in
fencing
i
kept
the
young
peasants
in
exercise
and
then
in
the
hall
in
the
evenings
he
went
on
with
his
cantrips
there
was
a
delicious
shoulder
of
bacon
hanging
up
on
the
farmer
brace
among
many
meaner
hams
and
pieces
of
wretched
dried
flesh
i
believe
i
had
fixed
my
eyes
on
it
and
perhaps
my
heart
a
little
too
whether
the
gorb
noticed
this
and
dreaded
the
consequences
or
not
i
can
not
tell
but
he
began
a
speech
about
things
not
being
what
they
appeared
to
be
and
offered
to
give
us
a
striking
instance
take
down
the
choicest
and
best
ham
among
all
these
above
the
fire
said
he
i
did
so
taking
down
the
shoulder
of
bacon
with
great
alacrity
take
down
the
worst
said
he
i
did
so
it
was
one
of
venison
dried
like
a
crooked
stick
which
do
you
account
the
best
said
he
i
told
him
well
you
are
mistaken
said
he
and
i
convince
you
of
it
roll
them
both
neatly
up
in
straw
or
as
you
will
i
did
so
now
do
you
know
the
one
from
the
other
yes
very
well
heave
them
up
again
that
you
may
not
be
mistaken
in
the
weight
now
cross
your
hands
and
heave
them
with
different
hands
quite
sensible
they
are
the
same
quite
sensible
very
well
take
them
aside
by
yourself
and
look
at
them
you
will
now
see
them
as
they
really
are
not
as
they
appeared
to
your
eyes
i
hastened
and
opened
out
the
shoulder
of
bacon
it
was
nothing
but
three
dried
bones
hanging
together
by
tendons
and
stuffed
up
into
the
shape
of
an
overgrown
shoulder
of
bacon
with
brawn
which
was
covered
round
with
a
piece
of
a
sow
hide
i
shed
some
tears
at
this
blighting
discovery
for
though
the
bacon
was
not
mine
i
felt
in
my
heart
that
i
did
not
know
how
matters
were
to
come
about
i
hung
the
two
hams
up
as
they
were
and
was
cured
of
my
itching
eye
but
no
man
can
tell
how
things
will
come
round
to
the
advantage
of
an
acute
and
clever
fellow
while
we
were
at
that
house
the
country
was
raised
to
follow
the
lord
of
galloway
into
cumberland
it
was
a
great
rising
the
utmost
quota
being
demanded
of
every
yeoman
in
the
country
in
terms
of
his
villanage
our
landlord
got
a
charge
to
find
five
whereas
he
had
none
to
send
save
three
unless
he
and
his
eldest
son
both
went
which
would
have
been
grievously
against
him
at
that
time
so
he
applied
to
my
master
and
me
to
go
on
his
behoof
offering
large
conditions
which
were
soon
accepted
the
principal
if
not
the
sole
thing
that
induced
me
to
go
out
on
that
raide
was
the
stipulation
that
i
was
to
have
my
choice
of
all
the
meat
in
the
house
to
the
amount
of
what
i
could
conveniently
carry
on
my
back
in
a
march
after
a
great
deal
of
choosing
i
fixed
on
a
small
because
it
was
solid
and
no
bones
in
it
and
blest
my
master
ingenuity
that
had
let
me
into
the
secret
of
the
deceitful
shoulder
of
bacon
the
next
that
came
after
me
was
a
blade
of
endless
frolic
and
humour
named
harestanes
he
instantly
snapped
at
the
and
popped
it
into
his
goatskin
wallet
nodding
his
head
and
twisting
his
mouth
at
me
as
much
as
if
he
had
said
what
a
taste
you
have
i
am
glad
you
had
not
the
sense
to
take
this
i
could
easily
have
prevented
him
by
revealing
the
secret
but
he
had
always
been
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
me
therefore
i
could
scarcely
contain
my
mirth
at
his
mistake
and
resolved
to
enjoy
his
disappointment
in
full
he
was
a
sprightly
handsome
youth
and
had
such
a
forward
and
impertinent
manner
that
he
contrived
to
make
friends
in
every
family
that
we
passed
by
particularly
with
the
women
so
that
he
lacked
nothing
that
he
desired
and
tho
i
watched
him
night
and
day
for
fear
of
losing
the
sport
he
never
took
out
his
bacon
to
break
it
up
till
the
fourth
day
after
our
departure
my
was
by
that
time
more
than
half
done
it
was
a
most
wretched
piece
of
meat
being
as
hard
as
wood
and
bitter
as
gall
but
i
was
still
comforted
with
this
that
it
was
so
much
better
than
my
comrade
it
was
about
eight
on
a
morning
on
the
english
side
of
the
border
that
harestanes
first
loosed
out
his
wallet
to
make
a
breakfast
of
his
bacon
and
he
being
very
hungry
i
sat
down
beside
him
to
enjoy
the
sport
taking
out
my
black
beef
likewise
all
that
i
could
do
i
could
not
retain
my
gravity
while
he
was
loosening
the
cords
and
taking
the
straw
from
about
his
ham
which
made
him
look
wistfully
at
me
and
ask
what
the
fool
meant
but
when
i
saw
him
look
seriously
and
greedily
at
it
and
then
take
out
his
knife
to
cut
off
a
great
slice
i
lost
all
power
and
fell
on
the
ground
in
a
convulsion
of
laughter
while
my
voice
went
away
to
a
perfect
wheezle
he
could
not
comprehend
me
in
the
least
degree
and
actually
began
to
cut
yes
he
actually
began
to
cut
through
the
bristly
skin
while
i
lay
spurring
the
ground
and
screaming
with
anticipation
of
the
grand
joke
that
was
to
ensue
before
i
could
recover
my
sight
from
amid
the
tears
of
extravagant
mirth
the
scene
was
changed
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
position
in
which
the
puppy
sat
when
my
eyes
cleared
no
it
is
impossible
i
ever
can
forget
it
conceive
a
wicked
impertinent
frolicksome
whelp
of
a
tailor
for
he
was
nothing
better
who
had
been
with
sir
robert
graham
maids
all
the
night
and
was
so
hungry
that
you
might
almost
have
cast
a
knot
on
him
sit
down
to
take
a
hearty
luncheon
of
his
bacon
ham
and
then
conceive
his
looks
when
he
found
he
had
nothing
but
rubbish
and
dry
bones
if
you
conceive
these
you
will
conceive
the
very
scene
that
i
saw
at
least
that
i
conceived
and
saw
in
my
mind
eye
how
could
i
but
laugh
no
it
was
impossible
i
could
abstain
from
laughter
but
yet
for
all
that
things
turned
out
quite
the
reverse
he
had
actually
sliced
off
a
rasher
of
bacon
the
fattest
the
whitest
and
the
most
beautiful
rasher
of
bacon
ever
i
had
seen
in
my
life
there
were
three
distinct
layers
of
lire
and
fat
curving
alternately
through
it
like
quarter
moons
no
man
ever
beheld
such
a
sight
he
sliced
out
another
piece
which
was
still
more
perfectly
beautiful
than
the
preceding
one
my
eyes
darkened
i
had
seen
enough
to
shew
me
the
enormity
of
my
folly
and
my
irreparable
loss
he
roasted
his
rashers
on
the
fire
the
fat
fried
out
of
them
and
flamed
among
the
embers
and
when
he
laid
them
on
his
bread
they
soaked
it
all
with
pure
liquid
fat
and
there
was
i
sitting
beside
him
gnawing
at
my
piece
of
infernal
beef
the
sinewy
hip
of
some
hateful
galloway
stott
that
had
died
of
the
blackleg
and
having
been
unfit
for
ought
else
had
been
dried
till
the
hateful
substance
was
out
of
it
yet
i
had
my
choice
of
both
and
took
this
i
shall
never
wish
any
friend
of
mine
to
suffer
such
pangs
as
i
did
that
morning
for
all
that
i
had
suffered
in
my
dangers
and
disappointments
was
nothing
to
them
i
would
fain
have
slain
the
gorb
privately
but
not
daring
to
do
that
i
resolved
never
to
see
his
face
again
after
the
vile
trick
he
had
played
all
my
hopes
and
all
my
enjoyments
of
the
foray
being
now
ended
i
resolved
on
taking
my
departure
and
that
by
the
time
my
enemy
had
the
first
slice
of
bacon
eaten
we
had
orders
to
halt
all
that
day
for
the
johnstons
and
the
jardines
were
a
day
march
before
us
their
advanced
columns
had
fallen
back
and
as
the
troops
were
sleeping
or
straggling
about
i
prepared
for
my
departure
my
comrade
having
been
with
the
knight
women
all
the
night
a
set
of
creatures
madder
than
himself
he
was
quite
worn
out
and
as
soon
as
he
got
his
inside
lined
with
the
salutary
beverage
he
fell
fast
asleep
an
inward
light
now
began
to
dawn
on
my
heart
brighter
than
the
sun
at
noon
day
and
lighting
my
steps
forward
to
future
felicity
my
breath
cut
short
with
ecstatic
delight
and
my
knees
trembled
as
i
formed
the
resolution
of
changing
hams
with
my
hopeful
comrade
his
wallet
was
lying
open
not
so
the
tailor
eyes
i
might
have
exchanged
coats
and
shoes
too
for
him
the
great
work
was
done
in
an
instant
i
whipped
out
his
shoulder
of
bacon
and
put
my
piece
of
black
timber
in
its
place
take
you
that
honest
man
said
i
to
myself
time
about
is
fair
play
i
have
given
you
something
that
will
exercise
your
jaws
for
a
while
when
i
found
that
i
had
this
most
delicious
of
all
morsels
on
my
back
i
was
so
light
that
i
scarcely
felt
my
feet
touch
the
ground
and
there
being
no
time
now
to
lose
i
made
straight
away
into
england
for
i
durst
not
turn
towards
scotland
the
sentinels
being
so
very
thick
on
that
quarter
our
advanced
guard
was
composed
of
the
gordons
from
the
ken
a
set
of
desperate
raggamuffins
whom
i
durst
not
have
gone
among
had
it
not
been
fair
forenoon
i
had
my
wallet
on
my
back
and
my
sword
by
my
side
and
when
i
saw
any
of
them
eying
me
i
went
up
to
them
and
asked
how
far
the
johnstons
were
before
us
what
the
devil
was
i
wanting
with
the
johnstons
o
i
was
afraid
there
might
be
a
battle
fought
before
i
saw
it
which
i
would
not
should
happen
for
any
thing
in
the
world
hear
to
the
piper
said
one
he
is
as
like
supping
a
pint
o
fat
brose
as
killing
an
englishman
said
another
i
wadna
trust
him
wi
ought
beyond
a
litter
o
english
pigs
said
a
third
let
him
gang
forrit
and
fiend
that
he
get
his
chafts
clawn
the
first
sword
that
drawn
i
wadna
that
his
name
were
gordon
for
a
hunder
civis
accordingly
i
got
liberty
to
pass
but
as
soon
as
i
got
out
of
sight
i
turned
to
the
left
and
escaped
to
the
moors
of
bewcastle
i
had
now
found
out
the
invaluable
art
of
flint
and
frizzle
and
could
kindle
a
fire
whenever
i
pleased
so
i
sought
out
a
lonely
wild
dell
and
lighting
a
fire
of
birns
and
strong
heather
roasted
two
slashing
slices
of
my
shoulder
of
bacon
i
also
took
a
good
shave
of
bread
from
my
friend
the
tailor
but
after
all
i
could
not
think
of
adulterating
the
savoury
delicious
fare
by
any
unnatural
intermixture
so
i
ate
up
the
dry
bread
by
itself
and
then
smacked
up
the
bacon
afterwards
i
can
not
describe
my
sensations
of
delight
not
only
in
my
meal
but
in
contemplating
the
beauty
of
the
object
i
sat
long
feasting
my
eyes
on
the
beauty
of
the
slices
before
i
committed
them
to
the
coals
they
were
curved
so
beautifully
in
the
fat
and
the
lire
time
about
that
unless
for
such
an
object
the
term
would
have
no
meaning
they
lay
alternately
as
if
it
were
this
way
and
this
way
and
this
way
i
protest
against
your
drawing
of
your
pictures
on
my
shoulder
cried
gibbie
and
also
against
the
party
being
any
longer
mocked
with
such
fulsome
trash
in
place
of
a
story
do
you
not
perceive
sir
master
and
do
you
not
all
perceive
that
he
is
havering
and
speaking
without
end
or
aim
he
is
sensible
that
he
has
failed
in
his
story
and
that
a
dismal
fate
awaits
him
and
all
that
he
is
now
intent
on
is
driving
of
time
i
confess
that
i
am
sick
of
the
bacon
and
other
fat
things
said
charlie
my
soul
disdains
the
abject
theme
said
the
poet
its
tantalizing
sight
is
like
the
marshfire
vacant
gleam
to
the
bewildered
wight
is
throwing
meat
to
hungry
souls
with
fainting
sore
opprest
or
drink
unto
the
parched
lips
whereof
they
may
not
taste
let
us
show
some
spirit
wretched
as
we
are
said
gibbie
and
protest
with
one
assent
against
being
farther
sickened
as
well
as
mocked
by
such
loathsome
stuff
this
is
unfair
and
using
undue
influence
cried
tam
none
of
you
were
thus
interrupted
but
got
time
to
finish
your
stories
as
you
liked
mine
is
not
done
the
best
part
of
it
is
yet
to
come
and
i
say
it
is
unfair
great
master
you
sit
as
judge
i
appeal
to
you
my
life
has
been
varied
let
them
chuse
what
sort
of
a
theme
they
want
and
i
will
fit
them
only
suffer
me
to
relate
one
other
exploit
the
master
on
whom
hunger
seemed
to
make
no
impression
thought
the
request
was
reasonable
but
in
making
choice
every
