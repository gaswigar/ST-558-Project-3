edition
with

and

brother
dedication
to
the
many
friends
who
pulled
for
us
if
not
with
us
during
the
one
hundred
one
days
of
our
river
trip
this
volume
is
respectfully
dedicated
foreword
it
is
a
dogged
courage
of
which
the
author
of
this
book
is
the
serene
possessor
shared
equally
by
his
daring
brother
and
evidence
of
this
bravery
is
made
plain
throughout
the
following
pages
every
youth
who
has
in
him
a
spark
of
adventure
will
kindle
with
desire
to
battle
his
way
also
from
green
river
to
the
foot
of
bright
angel
trail
while
every
man
whose
bones
have
been
stiffened
and
his
breath
made
short
by
the
years
will
remember
wistfully
such
wild
tastes
of
risk
and
conquest
that
he
too
rejoiced
in
when
he
was
young
whether
it
deal
with
the
climbing
of
dangerous
peaks
or
the
descent
as
here
of
some
fourteen
hundred
miles
of
water
both
mysterious
and
ferocious
the
tale
of
a
perilous
journey
planned
with
head
and
carried
through
with
dauntless
persistence
always
holds
the
attention
of
its
readers
and
gives
them
many
a
thrill
this
tale
is
very
well
told
though
it
is
the
third
of
its
kind
it
differs
from
its
predecessors
more
than
enough
to
hold
its
own
no
previous
explorers
have
attempted
to
take
moving
pictures
of
the
colorado
river
with
themselves
weltering
in
its
foam
more
than
this
while
the
human
race
lasts
it
will
be
true
that
any
man
who
is
lucky
enough
to
fix
upon
a
hard
goal
and
win
it
and
can
in
direct
and
simple
words
tell
us
how
he
won
it
will
write
a
good
book
perhaps
this
planet
does
somewhere
else
contain
a
thing
like
the
colorado
river
but
that
is
no
matter
we
at
any
rate
in
our
continent
possess
one
of
nature
very
vastest
works
after
the
river
and
its
tributaries
have
done
with
all
sight
of
the
upper
world
have
left
behind
the
bordering
plains
and
streamed
through
the
various
gashes
which
their
floods
have
sliced
in
the
mountains
that
once
stopped
their
way
then
the
culminating
wonder
begins
the
river
has
been
flowing
through
the
loneliest
part
which
remains
to
us
of
that
large
space
once
denominated
the
great
american
desert
by
the
vague
maps
in
our
old
geographies
it
has
passed
through
regions
of
emptiness
still
as
wild
as
they
were
before
columbus
came
where
not
only
no
man
lives
now
nor
any
mark
is
found
of
those
forgotten
men
of
the
cliffs
but
the
very
surface
of
the
earth
itself
looks
monstrous
and
extinct
upon
one
such
region
in
particular
the
author
of
these
pages
dwells
when
he
climbs
up
out
of
the
gulf
in
whose
bottom
he
has
left
his
boat
by
the
river
to
look
out
upon
a
world
of
round
gray
humps
and
hollows
which
seem
as
if
it
were
made
of
the
backs
of
huge
elephants
through
such
a
country
as
this
scarcely
belonging
to
our
era
any
more
than
the
mammoth
or
the
pterodactyl
scarcely
belonging
to
time
at
all
does
the
colorado
approach
and
enter
its
culminating
marvel
then
for
miles
it
inhabits
a
nether
world
of
its
own
the
few
that
have
ventured
through
these
places
and
lived
are
a
handful
to
those
who
went
in
and
were
never
seen
again
the
white
bones
of
some
have
been
found
on
the
shores
but
most
were
drowned
and
in
this
water
no
bodies
ever
rise
because
the
thick
sand
that
its
torrent
churns
along
clogs
and
sinks
them
this
place
exerts
a
magnetic
spell
the
sky
is
there
above
it
but
not
of
it
its
being
is
apart
its
climate
its
light
its
own
the
beams
of
the
sun
come
into
it
like
visitors
its
own
winds
blow
through
it
not
those
of
outside
where
we
live
the
river
streams
down
its
mysterious
reaches
hurrying
ceaselessly
sometimes
a
smooth
sliding
lap
sometimes
a
falling
broken
wilderness
of
billows
and
whirlpools
above
stand
its
walls
rising
through
space
upon
space
of
silence
they
glow
they
gloom
they
shine
bend
after
bend
they
reveal
themselves
endlessly
new
in
endlessly
changing
veils
of
colour
a
swimming
and
jewelled
blue
predominates
as
of
sapphires
being
melted
and
spun
into
skeins
of
shifting
cobweb
bend
after
bend
this
trance
of
beauty
and
awe
goes
on
terrible
as
the
day
of
judgment
sublime
as
the
psalms
of
david
five
thousand
feet
below
the
opens
and
barrens
of
arizona
this
canyon
seems
like
an
avenue
conducting
to
the
secret
of
the
universe
and
the
presence
of
the
gods
is
much
wonder
to
be
felt
that
its
beckoning
enchantment
should
have
drawn
two
young
men
to
dwell
beside
it
for
many
years
to
give
themselves
wholly
to
it
to
descend
and
ascend
among
its
buttressed
pinnacles
to
discover
caves
and
waterfalls
hidden
in
its
labyrinths
to
climb
to
creep
to
hang
in
in
order
to
learn
more
and
more
of
it
and
at
last
to
gratify
wholly
their
passion
in
the
great
adventure
of
this
journey
through
it
from
end
to
end
no
siren
song
could
have
lured
travellers
more
than
the
siren
silence
of
the
grand
canyon
but
these
young
men
did
not
leave
their
bones
to
whiten
upon
its
shores
the
courage
that
brought
them
out
whole
is
plain
throughout
this
narrative
in
spite
of
its
owen
wister
preface
this
is
a
simple
narrative
of
our
recent
photographic
trip
down
the
green
and
colorado
rivers
in
rowboats
our
observations
and
impressions
it
is
not
intended
to
replace
in
any
way
the
books
published
by
others
covering
a
similar
journey
major
report
of
the
original
exploration
for
instance
is
a
classic
literary
and
geological
and
searchers
after
excellence
may
well
be
recommended
to
his
admirable
work
neither
is
this
chronicle
intended
as
a
handbook
of
the
territory
traversed
such
as
dellenbaugh
two
volumes
the
romance
of
the
grand
canyon
and
a
canyon
voyage
we
could
hardly
hope
to
add
anything
of
value
to
his
wealth
of
detail
in
fact
much
of
the
data
given
here
such
as
distances
elevations
and
records
of
other
expeditions
is
borrowed
from
the
latter
volume
and
i
take
this
opportunity
of
expressing
our
appreciation
to
dellenbaugh
for
his
most
excellent
and
entertaining
books
we
are
indebted
to
julius
stone
of
columbus
ohio
for
much
valuable
information
and
assistance
stone
organized
a
party
and
made
the
complete
trip
down
the
green
and
colorado
rivers
in
the
fall
and
winter
of
arriving
at
needles
california
on
november
he
freely
gave
us
the
benefit
of
his
experience
and
presented
us
with
the
complete
plans
of
the
boats
he
used
one
member
of
this
party
was
nathan
galloway
of
richfield
utah
to
him
we
owe
much
of
the
success
of
our
journey
galloway
hunts
and
traps
through
the
wilds
of
utah
colorado
and
arizona
and
has
a
fame
for
skill
and
nerve
throughout
this
entire
region
he
makes
a
yearly
trip
through
the
upper
canyons
usually
in
a
boat
of
his
own
construction
and
in
addition
has
the
record
of
being
the
only
person
who
has
made
two
complete
trips
through
the
entire
series
of
canyons
clear
to
needles
he
it
is
who
has
worked
out
the
type
of
boats
we
used
and
their
management
in
the
dangerous
waters
of
the
colorado
we
have
tried
to
make
this
narrative
not
only
simple
as
we
say
but
truthful
however
no
two
people
can
see
things
in
exactly
the
same
light
to
some
nothing
looks
big
to
others
every
little
danger
is
unconsciously
magnified
out
of
all
proportion
for
instance
we
can
recall
rapids
which
appeared
rather
insignificant
at
first
but
which
seemed
decidedly
otherwise
after
we
had
been
overturned
in
them
and
had
felt
their
power
especially
at
the
moment
when
we
were
sure
we
had
swallowed
a
large
part
of
the
water
that
composed
them
the
reader
will
kindly
excuse
the
use
of
the
first
person
both
singular
and
plural
it
is
our
own
story
after
all
and
there
seems
to
be
no
other
way
than
to
tell
it

early
in

of
my

and
i
landed
in
green
river
city
wyoming
ready
for
the
launching
of
our
boats
on
our
trip
down
the
green
and
colorado
rivers
for
ten
years
previous
to
this
time
we
had
lived
at
the
grand
canyon
of
arizona
following
the
work
of
scenic
photography
in
a
general
way
we
had
covered
much
of
the
country
adjacent
to
our
home
following
our
pack
animals
over
ancient
and
trails
climbing
the
walls
of
tributary
canyons
dropping
over
the
ledges
with
ropes
when
necessary
always
in
search
of
the
interesting
and
unusual
after
ten
years
of
such
work
many
of
our
plans
in
connection
with
a
pictorial
exploration
of
the
grand
canyon
were
crowned
with
success
yet
all
the
while
our
real
ambition
remained
unsatisfied
we
wanted
to
make
the
big
trip
as
we
called
it
in
other
words
we
wanted
a
pictorial
record
of
the
entire
series
of
canyons
on
the
green
and
colorado
rivers
the
time
had
come
at
last
after
years
of
hoping
after
long
months
of
active
preparation
we
stood
at
the
freight
window
of
the
station
at
green
river
city
asking
for
news
of
our
boats
they
had
arrived
and
could
be
seen
in
their
crates
shoved
away
in
a
corner
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
with
them
that
day
so
we
let
them
remain
where
they
were
and
went
out
to
look
over
the
town
green
river
city
proved
to
be
a
busy
little
place
noisy
with
switch
engines
crowded
with
and
cowboys
and
with
hunting
parties
outfitting
for
the
jackson
hole
country
a
thoroughly
western
town
of
the
better
sort
with
all
the
picturesqueness
of
people
and
surroundings
that
the
name
implies
it
was
busier
than
usual
even
that
evening
for
a
noisy
but
crowd
had
gathered
around
the
telegraph
office
eager
for
news
of
a
wrestling
match
then
taking
place
in
an
eastern
city
as
we
came
up
they
broke
into
a
cheer
at
the
news
that
the
american
wrestler
had
defeated
his
foreign
opponent
there
was
a
discussion
as
to
what
constituted
the
three
boys
ran
an
impromptu
there
was
some
talk
on
the
poor
condition
of
the
range
and
the
party
began
to
break
up
the
little
excitement
over
we
returned
to
the
hotel
feeling
in
spite
of
our
enthusiasm
somewhat
lonesome
and
very
much
out
of
place
our
sleep
that
night
was
fitful
and
broken
by
dreams
wherein
the
places
we
had
known
were
strangely
interwoven
with
these
new
scenes
and
events
through
it
all
we
seemed
to
hear
the
roar
of
the
rio
colorado
we
looked
out
of
the
window
the
next
morning
on
a
landscape
that
was
novel
yet
somehow
familiar
the
river
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
very
clear
and
unruffled
under
its
groves
of
cottonwood
wound
through
low
barren
hills
as
unlike
as
could
be
to
the
cliffs
and
chasms
we
knew
so
well
but
the
colours
gray
red
and
umber
just
as
moran
has
painted
them
reassured
us
we
seemed
not
so
far
from
home
after
all
it
was
wyoming
weather
though
clear
and
cold
after
a
windy
night
when
after
breakfast
we
went
down
to
the
river
we
found
that
a
little
ice
had
formed
along
the
margin
the
days
of
final
preparation
passed
quickly
with
unpacking
of
innumerable
boxes
and
bundles
checking
off
each
article
against
our
lists
and
with
a
long
and
careful
overhauling
of
our
photographic
outfit
this
last
was
a
most
important
task
for
the
success
of
our
expedition
depended
on
our
success
as
photographers
we
could
not
hope
to
add
anything
of
importance
to
the
scientific
and
topographic
knowledge
of
the
canyons
already
existing
and
merely
to
come
out
alive
at
the
other
end
did
not
make
a
strong
appeal
to
our
vanity
we
were
there
as
scenic
photographers
in
love
with
their
work
and
determined
to
reproduce
the
marvels
of
the
colorado
canyons
as
far
as
we
could
do
it
in
addition
to
three
film
cameras
we
had
and
plate
cameras
a
plentiful
supply
of
plates
and
films
a
large
cloth
and
whatever
chemicals
we
should
need
for
tests
most
important
of
all
we
had
brought
a
camera
we
had
no
real
assurance
that
so
delicate
an
apparatus
always
difficult
to
use
and
regulate
could
even
survive
the
journey
much
less
in
such
inexperienced
hands
as
ours
reproduce
its
wonders
but
this
nevertheless
was
our
secret
hope
hardly
admitted
to
our
most
intimate
friends
that
we
could
bring
out
a
record
of
the
colorado
as
it
is
a
live
thing
armed
as
it
were
with
teeth
ready
to
crush
and
devour
there
was
shopping
to
do
for
the
purchases
of
provisions
with
a
few
exceptions
had
been
left
to
the
last
there
were
callers
too
an
embarrassing
number
of
them
we
had
camped
on
a
small
island
near
the
town
not
knowing
when
we
did
so
that
it
had
recently
been
put
aside
for
a
public
park
the
whole
of
green
river
city
it
seemed
had
learned
of
our
project
and
came
to
inspect
or
advise
or
jeer
at
us
the
kindest
of
them
wished
us
well
the
other
sort
told
us
it
would
serve
us
right
but
not
one
of
our
callers
had
any
encouragement
to
offer
many
were
the
stories
of
disaster
and
death
with
which
they
entertained
us
one
story
in
particular
as
it
seems
never
to
have
reached
print
though
unquestionably
true
ought
to
be
set
down
here
three
years
before
two
young
men
from
louis
had
embarked
here
intending
to
follow
the
river
throughout
its
whole
course
they
were
expert
canoeists
powerful
swimmers
and
equipped
with
a
steel
boat
we
were
told
built
somewhat
after
the
style
of
a
canoe
they
chose
the
time
of
high
water
not
knowing
probably
that
while
high
water
decreases
the
labour
of
the
passage
it
greatly
increases
the
danger
of
it
they
came
to
the
first
difficult
rapid
in
red
canyon
seventy
odd
miles
below
green
river
city
it
looked
bad
to
them
they
landed
above
it
and
stripped
to
their
underclothing
and
socks
then
they
pushed
out
into
the
stream
almost
at
once
they
lost
control
of
the
boat
it
overturned
it
rolled
over
and
over
it
flung
them
off
and
left
them
swimming
for
their
lives
in
some
way
possibly
the
currents
favouring
they
reached
the
shore
the
boat
with
all
its
contents
was
gone
there
they
were
almost
naked
without
food
without
weapons
without
the
means
of
building
a
fire
and
in
an
uninhabited
and
utterly
inhospitable
country
for
four
days
they
wandered
blistered
by
the
sun
by
day
nearly
frozen
at
night
bruised
by
the
rocks
and
torn
by
the
brambles
finally
they
reached
the
ranch
at
the
head
of
the
canyons
and
were
found
by
a
indian
who
cared
for
them
their
underwear
had
been
made
into
bindings
for
their
lacerated
feet
they
were
nearly
starved
and
on
the
verge
of
mental
collapse
after
two
treatment
in
the
hospital
at
green
river
city
they
were
partially
restored
to
health
quite
likely
they
spent
many
of
the
long
hours
of
their
convalescence
on
the
river
bank
or
on
the
little
island
watching
the
unruffled
stream
glide
underneath
the
cottonwoods
such
tales
as
this
added
nothing
to
our
fears
of
course
for
the
whole
history
of
the
colorado
is
one
long
story
of
hardship
and
disaster
and
we
knew
even
better
than
our
advisors
what
risks
lay
before
us
we
told
our
newfound
friends
in
fact
that
we
had
lived
for
years
on
the
brink
of
the
grand
canyon
itself
a
gorge
deeper
and
more
awful
even
than
lodore
with
a
volume
of
water
ten
times
greater
we
knew
of
course
of
the
river
vast
length
of
the
terrible
gorges
that
confined
it
of
the
hundreds
of
rapids
through
which
a
boat
would
have
to
pass
we
knew
too
how
major
powell
undismayed
by
legends
of
underground
channels
impassable
cataracts
and
whirlpools
of
bloodthirsty
tribes
haunting
its
recesses
had
passed
through
the
canyons
in
safety
measuring
and
surveying
as
he
went
we
also
knew
of
the
many
other
attempts
that
had
been
made
most
of
them
ending
in
disaster
or
death
a
very
few
being
successful
well
it
had
been
done
it
could
be
done
again
this
was
our
answer
to
their
premonitions
we
had
present
worries
enough
to
keep
us
from
dwelling
too
much
on
the
future
it
had
been
our
intention
to
start
two
weeks
earlier
but
there
had
been
numerous
unavoidable
delays
the
river
was
low
the
lowest
they
had
seen
it
in
years
they
told
us
and
falling
lower
every
day
there
were
the
usual
difficulties
of
arranging
a
lot
of
new
material
and
putting
it
in
working
order
at
last
we
were
ready
for
the
boats
and
you
may
be
sure
we
lost
no
time
in
having
them
hauled
to
the
river
and
launching
them
they
were
beauties
these
two
boats
of
ours
graceful
yet
strong
in
line
floating
easily
well
up
in
the
water
in
spite
of
their
five
hundred
pounds
weight
they
were
with
a
rake
or
raise
at
either
end
built
of
white
cedar
with
unusually
high
sides
with
arched
decks
in
bow
and
stern
for
the
safe
storing
of
supplies
sealed
air
chambers
were
placed
in
each
end
large
enough
to
keep
the
boats
afloat
even
if
filled
with
water
the
compartment
at
the
bow
was
lined
with
tin
carefully
soldered
so
that
even
a
leak
in
the
bottom
would
not
admit
water
to
our
precious
cargoes
we
had
placed
no
limit
on
their
cost
only
insisting
that
they
should
be
of
materials
and
workmanship
of
the
very
best
and
strictly
in
accordance
with
our
specifications
in
every
respect
but
one
they
pleased
us
imagine
our
consternation
when
we
discovered
that
the
hatch
covers
were
anything
but
though
we
had
insisted
more
upon
this
perhaps
than
upon
any
other
detail
loose
boards
with
fastened
with
little
thumbscrews
there
they
were
ready
to
admit
the
water
at
the
very
first
upset
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
it
was
too
late
to
rebuild
the
hatches
even
if
we
had
had
the
proper
material
owing
to
the
stage
of
water
it
was
imperative
that
we
should
start
at
once
bad
as
it
would
be
to
have
water
in
our
cargo
it
would
be
worse
to
have
too
little
water
in
the
channels
of
red
canyon
or
in
the
flats
at
brown
park
for
instance
certainly
the
boats
acted
so
beautifully
in
the
water
that
we
could
almost
overlook
the
defective
hatches
emery
rowed
upstream
for
a
hundred
yards
against
a
stiff
current
and
came
back
jubilant
they
great
simply
great
he
exclaimed
we
had
one
real
cause
for
worry
for
actual
anxiety
though
and
as
each
hour
brought
us
nearer
to
the
time
of
departure
we
grew
more
and
more
desperate
what
about
our
third
man
we
were
convinced
that
a
third
man
was
needed
if
not
for
the
duties
of
camp
making
helping
with
the
cooking
and
portaging
at
least
for
turning
the
crank
of
the
camera
emery
and
i
could
not
very
well
be
running
rapids
and
photographing
ourselves
in
the
rapids
at
the
same
time
without
a
capable
assistant
therefore
much
of
the
real
purpose
would
be
defeated
our
first
move
accordingly
had
been
to
secure
the
services
of
a
strong
and
competent
man
friends
strongly
advised
us
to
engage
a
canadian
or
at
least
some
one
familiar
with
the
management
of
boats
in
rough
water
it
was
suggested
also
that
we
might
secure
the
help
of
some
one
of
the
voyagers
who
had
been
members
of
one
of
the
previous
expeditions
but
we
may
as
well
be
frank
about
it
we
did
not
wish
to
be
piloted
through
the
colorado
by
a
guide
we
wanted
to
make
our
own
trip
in
our
own
way
if
we
failed
we
would
have
no
one
but
ourselves
to
blame
if
we
succeeded
we
would
have
all
the
satisfaction
that
comes
from
original
personal
exploration
in
other
words
we
wanted
a
man
to
execute
orders
not
to
give
them
but
that
man
was
hard
to
find
there
had
been
many
applicants
some
of
them
from
distant
parts
of
the
country
one
by
one
they
were
sifted
out
at
length
we
decided
on
one
man
but
later
he
withdrew
we
turned
elsewhere
but
these
applications
were
withdrawn
until
there
remained
but
a
single
letter
from
a
young
man
in
san
francisco
he
seemed
in
every
way
qualified
we
wrote
accepting
his
application
but
while
waiting
to
hear
from
us
a
civil
service
position
had
been
offered
and
accepted
he
was
sorry
and
so
were
we
for
his
references
proved
that
he
was
a
capable
man
later
he
wrote
that
he
had
secured
a
substitute
we
replied
on
the
instant
by
wiring
money
for
transportation
with
instructions
for
the
new
man
to
report
at
once
at
green
river
we
took
very
much
for
granted
having
confidence
in
our
friends
sincerity
and
knowledge
of
just
what
was
required
the
time
had
passed
two
days
before
but
no
sign
of
our
man
we
wrote
we
telegraphed
we
walked
back
and
forth
to
every
train
but
still
he
did
not
come
had
this
man
too
failed
us
then
jimmy
came
just
the
night
before
we
were
to
leave
and
never
was
a
man
more
heartily
welcome
with
james
fagen
of
san
francisco
our
party
was
complete
he
was
an
aged
years
a
strong
active
and
willing
chap
to
be
sure
he
was
younger
and
not
so
experienced
at
roughing
it
as
we
had
hoped
but
his
good
qualities
we
were
sure
would
make
up
for
what
was
lacking
evening
found
us
encamped
a
half
mile
below
the
town
the
county
bridge
our
preparations
were
finished
even
to
the
final
purchase
of
odds
and
ends
with
ammunition
for
and
rifle
we
threw
our
on
the
dry
ground
close
to
the
river
edge
and
all
our
anxieties
gone
we
turned
our
faces
to
the
stars
and
slept
at
daybreak
we
were
aroused
by
the
thunder
of
hoofs
on
the
bridge
above
us
and
the
shouts
of
cowboys
driving
a
large
herd
of
horses
we
tumbled
into
our
clothes
splashed
our
faces
with
water
from
the
river
and
hurried
over
to
the
hotel
for
a
last
breakfast
then
we
sat
down
in
the
little
hotel
at
green
river
city
as
others
had
done
before
to
write
last
messages
to
those
who
were
nearest
and
dearest
to
us
a
telegram
to
our
parents
in
an
eastern
city
and
another
to
emery
wife
and
little
girl
at
bright
angel
more
than
eight
hundred
miles
down
this
river
these
somehow
took
longer
to
write
than
the
letters
themselves
but
whatever
we
may
have
felt
we
finished
this
final
correspondence
in
silence
and
hurried
back
to
the
river
something
of
a
crowd
had
gathered
on
the
bridge
to
wish
us
shouting
up
to
them
our
thanks
for
their
hospitality
and
telling
them
to
look
pleasant
we
focussed
the
camera
on
them
emery
turning
the
crank
as
the
boat
swung
out
into
the
current
so
began
our
journey
on
friday
september
the
at
as
entered
in
my
journal
chapter
ii
interesting
sights
of
southern
wyoming
all
this
preparation
and
still
more
the
vexatious
delays
had
been
a
heavy
tax
upon
us
we
needed
a
vacation
we
took
it
six
pleasant
days
hunting
and
fishing
as
we
drifted
through
the
sixty
miles
of
southern
wyoming
there
were
ducks
and
geese
on
the
river
to
test
our
skill
with
the
only
two
miles
below
green
river
city
emery
secured
our
first
duck
a
promise
of
good
sport
to
follow
an
occasional
cottontail
rabbit
was
seen
scurrying
to
cover
through
the
when
we
made
a
detour
from
the
boats
we
saw
many
too
with
their
long
legs
and
exaggerated
ears
creatures
swifter
even
than
the
coyotes
themselves
we
saw
few
people
though
an
occasional
rancher
hailed
us
from
the
shore
men
of
the
open
themselves
the
character
of
our
expedition
appealed
to
them
their
invitations
to
come
up
to
the
ranch
and
spend
the
evening
were
always
hearty
and
could
seldom
be
refused
if
the
day
was
nearly
gone
the
logan
boys
ranch
for
instance
was
our
first
camp
but
will
be
one
of
the
last
to
be
forgotten
the
two
logan
boys
were
sturdy
companionable
young
men
full
of
pranks
and
of
that
bubbling
generous
humour
that
flourishes
in
this
western
air
we
were
amused
by
their
kindly
offer
to
allow
jimmy
to
ride
the
little
bay
a
beautiful
animal
with
the
shifty
eye
of
a
criminal
but
jimmy
though
was
not
to
be
trapped
and
declined
very
wisely
as
we
thought
we
photographed
their
favourite
horses
and
the
cabin
also
helped
them
with
their
own
camera
and
developed
some
plates
in
the
underground
a
perfect
as
it
happened
we
took
advantage
of
this
pleasant
camp
to
make
a
few
alterations
about
our
boats
certain
mechanical
details
had
been
neglected
in
our
desire
to
be
off
our
intention
being
to
look
after
them
as
occasion
demanded
our
short
run
had
already
shown
us
where
we
were
weak
or
unprepared
the
rowlocks
needed
strengthening
one
had
come
apart
in
our
first
brush
with
a
little
riffle
the
rowlocks
were
of
a
type
but
very
serviceable
in
dangerous
waters
inside
the
usual
rowlock
a
heavy
ring
was
hung
kept
in
place
by
strong
but
allowing
full
play
in
every
direction
these
rings
were
slipped
over
the
oars
then
the
usual
leather
collar
was
nailed
on
the
oar
making
it
impossible
for
the
rings
to
become
separated
from
the
oars
the
holes
for
the
were
too
shallow
so
we
went
over
the
entire
lot
to
deepen
them
we
foresaw
where
a
break
might
occur
and
hung
another
lock
of
the
open
type
on
a
cord
beside
each
oar
ready
for
instant
use
in
case
of
emergency
the
logan
boys
seeing
our
difficulties
in
making
some
of
these
changes
came
to
our
relief
help
yourselves
to
the
blacksmith
shop
they
said
heartily
here
was
an
opportunity
much
time
was
consumed
in
providing
a
device
to
hold
our
extra
oars
out
of
the
way
on
top
of
the
deck
but
available
at
a
moment
notice
thanks
to
the
logan
boys
and
their
blacksmith
shop
these
and
many
other
little
details
were
corrected
once
for
all
and
we
launched
our
boats
in
confidence
on
the
morning
of
september
a
few
miles
below
we
came
to
the
locally
famous
fire
hole
chimneys
interesting
examples
of
the
butte
formation
so
typical
of
the
west
there
were
several
of
these
buttes
about
feet
high
composed
of
stratified
rock
in
colour
quite
similar
to
the
rocks
at
green
river
city
but
capped
with
rock
of
a
peculiar
burnt
appearance
though
not
of
volcanic
origin
some
of
the
buttes
sloped
up
from
the
very
edge
of
the
river
others
were
separated
from
the
river
by
low
flats
covered
with
and
that
nutritious
food
of
the
range
stock
at
the
water
edge
was
the
usual
fringe
of
willows
cottonwoods
and
shrubs
innumerable
all
mirrored
in
the
limpid
surface
of
green
river
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
were
a
number
of
wild
burros
old
and
young
fuzzy
little
looking
ridiculously
like
snorting
their
indignation
at
our
invasion
of
their
privacy
strange
by
the
way
how
quickly
these
wild
asses
lose
their
wildness
of
carriage
when
broken
and
lapse
into
the
utmost
docility
just
below
the
chimneys
emery
caught
sight
of
fish
gathered
in
a
deep
pool
under
the
foliage
of
a
cottonwood
tree
which
had
fallen
into
the
river
our
most
tempting
bait
failed
to
interest
them
so
emery
ever
clever
with
hook
and
line
snagged
one
just
to
teach
them
better
manners
it
was
a
colorado
river
salmon
or
whitefish
that
evening
i
snagged
a
catfish
and
used
this
for
salmon
bait
a
specimen
rewarding
the
attempt
these
salmon
were
old
friends
of
ours
being
found
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
colorado
and
on
all
its
tributaries
they
sometimes
weigh
or
thirty
pounds
and
are
common
at
twenty
pounds
being
stockily
built
fish
with
large
flat
heads
they
are
not
gamey
but
afford
a
lot
of
meat
with
a
very
satisfying
flavour
on
september
about
forty
miles
below
green
river
we
passed
black
fork
a
tributary
entering
from
the
west
it
is
a
stream
of
considerable
length
but
was
of
little
volume
at
that
time
the
banks
were
cliffs
about
feet
high
rugged
dark
and
overhanging
here
were
a
half
dozen
eagles
and
many
old
nests
proof
enough
if
proof
were
needed
that
we
were
in
a
little
visited
country
what
strong
splendid
birds
they
were
how
powerful
and
graceful
their
flight
as
they
circled
up
and
up
into
the
clear
blue
sky
our
next
camp
was
at
the
holmes
ranch
a
few
miles
below
fork
we
tried
to
buy
some
eggs
of
walter
holmes
and
were
told
that
we
could
have
them
on
one
condition
that
we
visit
him
that
evening
this
was
a
price
we
were
only
too
glad
to
pay
and
the
evening
will
linger
long
in
our
memories
holmes
entertained
us
with
stories
of
hunting
trips
after
big
game
in
the
wilds
of
colorado
and
among
the
lakes
of
the
wind
river
mountains
the
distant
source
of
the
green
river
holmes
and
two
young
ladies
entertained
us
with
music
and
jimmy
much
to
our
surprise
joined
in
with
a
full
rich
baritone
it
was
late
that
night
when
we
rolled
ourselves
in
our
blankets
on
the
banks
twenty
feet
above
the
river
next
morning
we
were
shown
a
group
of
holmes
pets
several
young
rabbits
and
a
kitten
romping
together
in
the
utmost
good
fellowship
the
rabbits
had
been
rescued
from
a
watery
grave
in
an
irrigation
ditch
and
carefully
nursed
back
to
life
we
helped
her
search
for
a
lame
wild
duck
that
had
spurned
the
offer
of
a
good
home
with
civilized
ducklings
and
had
taken
to
the
love
of
wild
animals
however
failed
to
include
the
eagle
that
had
shown
such
an
appetite
for
her
spring
chickens
a
few
miles
below
this
ranch
we
passed
bridger
crossing
a
ford
on
an
old
trail
through
southern
wyoming
in
pioneer
days
jim
bridger
home
was
on
this
very
spot
but
those
romantic
days
are
long
since
past
and
where
this
scout
once
watched
through
the
loopholes
of
his
barricade
was
an
amazed
youngster
ten
or
eleven
years
old
who
gazed
on
us
then
ran
to
the
cabin
and
emerged
with
a
rifle
in
his
hands
we
thought
little
of
this
incident
at
the
time
but
later
we
met
the
father
of
the
boy
and
were
told
that
the
children
had
been
left
alone
with
the
small
boy
as
their
only
protector
and
that
he
stood
ready
to
defend
the
home
against
any
possible
marauders
no
doubt
we
looked
bad
enough
to
him
just
below
the
ford
the
channel
widened
and
the
river
became
very
shallow
the
low
rolling
hills
falling
away
into
a
wide
green
prairie
we
camped
that
night
on
a
small
island
low
and
treeless
but
covered
with
deep
rank
grass
next
morning
our
were
wet
with
frost
and
dew
a
hard
pull
against
a
heavy
wind
between
gradually
deepening
rocky
banks
made
us
more
than
glad
to
pitch
camp
at
noon
a
short
distance
above
the
mouth
of
henry
fork
a
considerable
stream
flowing
from
the
west
in
the
afternoon
emery
and
i
decided
to
walk
to
linwood
lying
just
across
the
utah
line
four
miles
up
henry
fork
jimmy
preferred
to
remain
with
the
boats
between
the
river
and
a
low
mesa
lay
a
large
ranch
of
a
different
appearance
from
those
others
which
we
had
passed
those
past
were
cattle
ranches
with
stock
on
the
open
range
and
with
little
ground
fit
for
cultivation
owing
to
the
elevation
here
we
found
great
broad
acres
fenced
and
cultivated
with
thoroughbred
stock
horses
and
cattle
contentedly
grazing
this
pastoral
scene
with
a
background
of
rugged
mountains
appealed
strongly
to
our
photographic
instincts
after
three
or
four
exposures
we
climbed
the
farthest
fence
and
passing
from
alfalfa
to
in
one
step
were
at
the
foot
of
the
mesa
climbing
to
the
summit
we
beheld
the
village
in
the
distance
in
a
beautiful
green
valley
a
splendid
example
of
mormon
irrigation
and
farming
methods
linwood
proved
to
be
the
for
all
the
ranchers
of
this
region
dotting
the
where
water
was
less
plentiful
were
occasional
cabins
set
down
in
the
middle
of
hay
ranches
all
this
husbandry
only
emphasized
the
surrounding
desolation
just
beyond
dark
in
the
southern
sky
rose
the
great
peaks
of
the
uintah
range
the
mountains
we
were
so
soon
to
enter
had
been
gathering
about
one
great
peak
far
in
the
distance
these
clouds
spread
and
darkened
moving
rapidly
forward
we
had
taken
the
hint
and
were
already
making
all
possible
haste
toward
the
town
hoping
to
reach
it
before
the
storm
broke
but
it
was
useless
long
before
we
had
gained
the
edge
of
the
valley
the
rain
had
commenced
in
the
mountains
small
local
storms
resembling
delicate
veils
hung
in
the
dense
pall
of
the
clouds
there
were
far
flashes
of
lightning
and
the
subdued
roar
of
distant
thunder
rapidly
growing
louder
as
the
storm
approached
unable
to
escape
a
drenching
we
paused
a
moment
to
wonder
at
the
sight
to
marvel
and
shrink
a
little
too
at
the
wild
incessant
lightning
the
peaks
themselves
seemed
to
be
tumbling
together
such
was
the
continuous
roar
of
thunder
punctuated
by
frequent
deafening
crashes
then
the
storm
came
down
upon
us
such
torrents
of
rain
we
have
seldom
witnessed
such
gusts
of
driving
wind
at
times
we
could
scarcely
make
headway
against
it
but
after
most
strenuous
effort
we
neared
the
village
we
hoped
to
find
shelter
under
a
bridge
but
found
innumerable
muddy
streams
running
through
the
planks
so
we
resumed
our
plodding
slipping
and
sliding
in
the
black
bottomless
mud
the
storm
by
this
time
had
passed
as
quickly
as
it
came
wet
to
our
skins
we
crawled
into
the
little
store
and
combined
and
found
it
filled
with
ranch
hands
waiting
for
the
weekly
mail
we
made
a
few
purchases
wrote
some
letters
then
went
to
a
large
near
by
and
fortified
ourselves
with
a
generous
hot
supper
there
were
comments
by
some
of
the
men
on
our
venture
but
they
lacked
the
true
green
river
tang
here
close
to
the
upper
canyons
the
unreasonable
fear
of
the
rapids
gave
way
to
a
reasonable
respect
for
them
here
we
heard
again
of
the
two
young
men
from
louis
and
the
mishaps
that
had
befallen
them
here
too
we
were
to
hear
for
the
first
time
of
the
two
snyders
father
and
son
and
the
misfortunes
that
had
overtaken
them
in
lodore
canyon
twenty
years
before
we
were
to
hear
more
of
these
men
later
we
made
what
haste
we
could
back
to
our
boats
soon
being
overtaken
by
a
horseman
a
swede
who
insisted
on
carrying
our
load
as
long
as
we
were
going
in
his
direction
how
many
just
such
instances
of
kindliness
we
were
to
experience
on
our
journey
down
the
river
how
the
west
abounds
with
such
men
it
was
dark
when
he
left
us
a
mile
from
the
river
here
there
was
no
road
to
follow
and
we
found
that
what
had
been
numerous
dry
gullies
before
were
now
streams
of
muddy
water
two
or
three
of
these
streams
had
to
be
crossed
and
we
had
a
disagreeable
half
hour
in
a
marsh
finally
we
reached
the
river
but
not
at
the
point
where
we
had
left
our
boats
we
were
uncertain
whether
the
camp
was
above
or
below
us
and
called
loudly
for
jimmy
but
received
no
answer
emery
felt
sure
that
camp
was
upstream
so
upstream
we
went
keeping
back
of
the
bushes
that
fringed
the
banks
carefully
searching
for
a
sign
after
a
few
minutes
hunt
we
heard
a
sound
a
subdued
rumble
not
unlike
the
distant
thunder
heard
that
afternoon
or
of
boats
being
dragged
over
the
pebbles
what
could
it
be
we
listened
again
carefully
this
time
and
discovered
that
it
came
from
a
point
about
thirty
feet
away
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bushes
it
could
be
only
one
thing
jimmy
snore
had
brought
us
home
hurriedly
securing
some
dry
clothes
from
the
rubber
sacks
which
contained
our
as
well
we
made
a
quick
change
and
slid
into
the
beds
inflating
the
air
mattresses
with
our
lungs
after
we
were
inside
then
we
lay
down
contentedly
to
rest
chapter
iii
the
gateway
of
all
the
canyons
we
awoke
the
next
morning
full
of
anticipation
something
new
lay
ahead
of
us
a
promise
of
variety
in
plain
sight
of
our
camp
lay
the
entrance
to
flaming
gorge
the
gateway
to
the
entire
series
of
canyons
hurriedly
finishing
our
camp
duties
we
loaded
the
boats
fastened
down
the
hatches
and
shoved
off
into
the
current
eager
to
be
on
our
way
it
was
cloudy
overhead
and
looked
as
if
we
were
to
have
more
rain
even
then
it
must
have
been
raining
away
to
the
north
for
a
dirty
torrent
rushed
through
the
dry
arroyo
of
the
night
before
a
stream
large
enough
to
discolour
the
water
of
the
green
itself
but
we
thought
little
of
this
we
were
used
to
seeing
muddy
water
in
the
colorado
gorges
in
fact
we
were
surprised
to
find
clear
water
at
all
even
in
the
green
river
rowing
downstream
we
found
that
the
country
sloped
gently
towards
the
mountains
the
river
skirted
the
edge
of
these
as
if
looking
for
a
possible
escape
then
turned
and
entered
the
mountain
at
a
sharp
angle
the
walls
sloped
back
considerably
at
first
and
there
was
a
little
shore
on
either
side
somewhere
near
this
point
runs
the
dividing
line
of
wyoming
and
utah
we
considered
the
gateway
a
subject
worthy
of
a
motion
picture
if
taken
from
the
deck
of
the
boat
but
doubted
if
it
would
be
a
success
owing
to
the
condition
of
the
light
and
the
motion
of
the
boat
still
it
was
considered
worthy
of
a
trial
and
the
film
was
run
through
the
colour
of
the
rocks
at
the
entrance
was
a
light
red
but
not
out
of
the
ordinary
in
brilliancy
the
rock
formation
was
stratified
but
displaced
standing
at
an
angle
and
flexed
over
on
top
with
a
ragged
break
here
and
there
showing
plainly
the
great
pressure
to
which
the
rocks
had
been
subjected
the
upheaval
was
not
violent
the
scientists
tell
us
but
slow
and
even
allowing
the
river
to
maintain
its
old
channel
sawing
its
way
through
the
sandstone
the
broken
canyon
walls
when
well
inside
the
gorge
were
about
to
feet
high
the
mountains
beyond
and
on
either
side
were
much
higher
the
growth
on
the
mountain
sides
was
principally
evergreen
douglas
fir
the
and
yellow
pine
there
was
a
species
of
juniper
somewhat
different
from
the
utah
juniper
with
which
we
were
familiar
at
the
grand
canyon
bushes
and
undergrowth
were
dense
above
the
steep
canyon
walls
which
were
bare
willows
and
a
few
cottonwood
trees
lined
the
shores
meanwhile
the
current
had
quickened
almost
imperceptibly
at
first
but
enough
to
put
us
on
our
guard
while
there
were
no
rapids
use
was
made
of
what
swift
water
we
found
by
practising
on
the
method
we
would
use
in
making
a
passage
through
the
bad
rapids
as
to
this
method
unused
as
yet
by
either
of
us
we
had
received
careful
verbal
instruction
from
stone
who
had
made
the
trip
two
years
before
our
own
venture
and
from
other
friends
of
nathan
galloway
the
trapper
the
man
who
first
introduced
the
method
on
the
green
and
colorado
rivers
our
experience
on
water
of
any
kind
was
rather
limited
emery
could
row
a
boat
and
row
it
well
before
we
left
green
river
but
had
never
gone
over
any
large
rapids
while
he
was
not
nearly
so
large
or
heavy
as
i
weighing
no
more
than
pounds
while
i
weighed
pounds
he
made
up
for
his
lighter
weight
by
a
quickness
and
strength
that
often
surprised
me
he
was
always
neat
and
clever
in
his
method
of
handling
his
boat
taking
a
great
deal
of
pride
in
keeping
it
free
from
marks
and
avoiding
rocks
when
making
a
landing
i
had
done
very
little
rowing
before
leaving
green
river
so
little
that
i
had
difficulty
in
getting
both
oars
in
the
water
at
the
same
time
of
course
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
learn
that
but
i
did
not
have
the
knack
of
making
clean
landings
and
bumped
many
rocks
that
my
brother
missed
still
i
was
improving
all
the
time
and
was
anxious
to
get
into
the
rough
water
feeling
sure
i
would
get
through
somehow
but
doing
my
best
in
the
meantime
to
get
the
knack
of
handling
the
boat
properly
before
the
rough
water
was
reached
an
occasional
rock
would
stick
up
above
the
surface
the
swift
water
would
rush
up
on
it
or
drive
past
on
either
side
instead
of
pulling
downstream
with
might
and
main
and
depending
on
a
steersman
with
a
to
keep
us
clear
of
obstructions
the
method
usually
adopted
on
large
rivers
and
by
the
earlier
parties
on
the
colorado
by
our
method
the
single
oarsman
reversed
his
boat
so
that
it
was
turned
with
the
stern
downstream
giving
the
oarsman
a
view
of
what
was
ahead
then
by
pulling
upstream
the
boat
was
held
in
check
we
allowed
ourselves
to
be
carried
in
a
direct
line
with
the
rocks
ahead
approaching
them
as
closely
as
we
dared
then
with
a
pull
on
one
oar
the
boat
was
turned
slightly
at
an
angle
to
the
current
and
swung
to
one
side
or
the
other
just
as
a
ferry
is
headed
into
the
current
the
water
itself
helping
to
force
it
across
the
ferry
is
held
by
a
cable
the
boat
by
the
oarsman
the
results
are
quite
similar
the
boats
too
were
somewhat
unusual
in
design
having
been
carefully
worked
out
by
galloway
after
much
experience
with
the
problem
and
after
building
many
boats
he
finally
settled
on
the
design
furnished
us
by
stone
the
flat
bottom
sloping
up
from
the
centre
to
either
end
placed
the
boats
on
a
pivot
one
might
say
so
that
they
could
be
turned
very
quickly
much
more
quickly
than
if
they
had
had
a
keel
there
was
a
four
foot
skag
or
keel
under
the
stern
end
of
the
boat
but
this
was
only
used
when
in
quiet
water
and
as
it
was
never
replaced
after
being
once
removed
we
seldom
refer
to
it
being
they
drew
comparatively
little
water
a
matter
quite
important
on
low
water
such
as
we
found
in
the
green
river
while
each
boat
carried
a
weight
of
seven
hundred
pounds
in
addition
to
its
own
five
hundred
pounds
they
often
passed
over
rocks
less
than
ten
inches
below
the
surface
and
did
so
without
touching
while
the
boats
were
quite
large
the
arched
decks
made
them
look
even
larger
a
considerable
amount
of
material
could
be
stored
under
these
decks
the
only
part
of
the
boat
that
was
entirely
open
or
unprotected
from
the
waves
was
the
cockpit
or
occupied
by
the
oarsman
this
was
only
large
enough
for
one
man
a
second
man
had
to
sit
on
the
deck
behind
the
oarsman
with
his
feet
hanging
into
the
cockpit
jimmy
occupied
this
place
of
honour
as
we
drifted
through
the
placid
water
first
on
one
boat
then
on
the
other
entertaining
us
meanwhile
with
his
songs
we
encountered
two
splashy
little
rapids
this
day
but
with
no
rocks
or
any
dangerous
feature
whatever
any
method
or
none
at
all
was
safe
enough
in
these
rapids
the
colouring
of
the
rocks
changed
as
we
proceeded
and
at
the
lower
end
of
the
short
canyon
we
saw
the
flaming
patch
of
colour
that
had
suggested
its
name
to
major
powell
years
before
intensified
on
that
occasion
by
the
reflected
light
of
a
gorgeous
sunset
it
must
have
been
a
most
brilliant
spectacle
two
beavers
slid
into
the
water
when
we
were
close
beside
them
then
rose
to
the
surface
to
stare
curiously
when
we
had
passed
we
left
them
undisturbed
some
geese
decoyed
us
into
an
attempt
to
ambush
them
but
they
kept
always
just
out
of
reach
of
our
guns
wise
fellows
those
geese
a
geological
fault
accompanied
by
the
breaking
down
of
the
walls
marks
the
division
between
flaming
gorge
and
horseshoe
canyon
which
immediately
follows
we
nooned
here
opposite
a
deserted
cabin
a
trail
dropped
by
easy
stages
over
the
slope
on
the
east
side
and
fresh
tracks
showed
that
sheep
had
recently
been
driven
down
to
the
water
edge
passing
through
horseshoe
another
very
short
canyon
we
found
deep
placid
pools
and
sheer
light
red
walls
rising
about
four
hundred
feet
on
either
side
then
sloping
back
steeply
to
the
mountains
in
the
middle
of
this
canyon
emery
was
startled
out
of
a
by
a
rock
falling
into
the
water
close
beside
him
with
never
a
sound
of
warning
years
spent
in
the
canyons
had
accustomed
emery
and
me
to
such
occurrences
but
jimmy
unused
to
great
gorges
and
towering
cliffs
was
much
impressed
by
this
incident
after
all
it
is
only
the
unusual
that
is
terrible
jimmy
was
ready
enough
to
take
his
chances
at
dodging
bricks
hurled
by
a
san
francisco
earthquake
but
never
got
quite
used
to
rocks
descending
from
a
source
altogether
out
of
sight
small
wonder
after
all
later
we
were
to
experience
more
of
this
thing
and
on
a
scale
to
startle
a
stoic
we
halted
at
the
end
of
horseshoe
early
in
the
afternoon
of
september
one
week
out
from
green
river
city
camp
no
was
pitched
on
a
gravelly
shore
beside
sheep
creek
a
clear
sparkling
stream
coming
in
from
the
slopes
of
the
uintah
range
just
above
us
on
the
west
rose
three
jagged
cliffs
about
five
hundred
feet
high
reminding
one
by
their
shape
of
the
three
brothers
of
yosemite
valley
here
again
we
were
treated
to
another
wonderful
example
of
geologic
displacement
the
rocks
of
horseshoe
canyon
lying
in
level
strata
while
those
of
kingfisher
which
followed
were
standing
on
end
sheep
creek
flowing
from
the
west
finds
an
easy
course
through
the
fault
at
the
division
of
the
canyons
the
balance
of
this
day
was
spent
in
carefully
packing
our
material
and
rearranging
it
in
our
boats
for
we
expected
hard
work
to
follow
tempted
by
the
rippling
song
of
the
brook
and
by
tales
of
fish
to
be
found
therein
we
spent
two
hours
fishing
from
its
banks
on
the
morning
of
the
but
the
foliage
of
overhanging
trees
and
shrubs
was
dense
making
it
difficult
to
cast
our
lines
or
even
to
climb
along
its
shores
and
our
small
catch
of
two
trout
which
were
fried
with
a
strip
of
bacon
to
add
flavour
only
whetted
our
appetites
for
more
it
was
a
little
late
in
the
season
for
many
birds
here
in
kingfisher
canyon
were
a
few
of
the
birds
from
which
the
canyon
took
its
name
there
were
many
of
the
tireless
scattered
all
through
these
canyons
wheeling
and
darting
ever
on
the
wing
these
with
the
noisy
crested
jays
an
occasional
the
little
nuthatches
the
cheerful
canyon
wren
with
his
rollicking
song
the
happy
and
and
the
water
birds
ducks
geese
and
with
an
occasional
crane
made
up
the
bird
life
seen
in
the
open
country
and
in
these
upper
canyons
earlier
in
the
season
it
must
be
a
bird
paradise
for
berries
and
seeds
would
then
be
plentiful
we
resumed
our
journey
at
a
very
short
run
bringing
us
to
the
end
of
kingfisher
canyon
the
three
canyons
passed
through
approximate
hardly
more
than
ten
miles
in
length
different
names
being
given
for
geological
reasons
as
they
really
form
only
one
canyon
the
walls
at
the
end
were
broken
down
and
brilliantly
tinted
talus
of
many
hues
covered
the
slopes
the
different
colours
intermingling
near
the
bottom
the
river
turned
southeast
here
and
continued
in
this
general
direction
for
many
miles
but
with
many
twists
and
turns
we
had
previously
been
informed
that
red
canyon
the
next
to
follow
while
not
considered
bad
when
compared
to
others
gave
one
the
experience
most
necessary
to
combat
the
rapids
farther
down
it
was
not
without
danger
however
as
a
review
of
previous
expeditions
showed
some
had
lost
their
lives
still
others
their
boats
and
one
of
major
powell
parties
had
upset
a
boat
in
a
red
canyon
rapid
the
stage
of
water
was
so
different
on
these
previous
attempts
that
their
experiences
were
of
little
value
to
us
one
way
or
the
other
a
reference
to
pictures
taken
by
two
of
these
parties
showed
us
there
was
considerable
more
water
when
they
went
through
six
and
even
eight
feet
higher
in
places
possibly
this
would
be
the
best
stage
on
which
to
make
the
voyage
in
heavy
boats
the
unfortunate
ones
had
taken
the
spring
rise
or
flood
water
with
disastrous
results
to
themselves
or
their
boats
we
soon
found
that
our
passage
was
to
be
hard
on
account
of
having
too
little
water
in
the
quiet
water
above
we
had
been
seldom
bothered
with
shoals
but
now
that
we
were
in
swifter
water
there
was
scarcely
any
depth
to
it
at
all
except
in
the
quiet
pools
between
the
rapids
for
a
description
of
our
passage
through
this
upper
end
of
red
canyon
we
refer
to
our
journal
sketchy
notes
jotted
down
usually
in
the
evening
just
before
retiring
by
the
light
of
a
or
the
flickering
flame
of
a
candle
under
the
date
of
friday
september
the
we
find
the
following
end
of
kingfisher
long
quiet
pools
and
shoals
where
we
grounded
a
few
times
several
small
splashy
rapids
then
a
larger
one
near
an
old
boat
landing
looked
the
rapid
over
from
the
shore
jim
remained
at
the
lower
end
with
a
on
a
rope
while
we
ran
the
rapid
struck
one
or
two
rocks
lightly
but
made
the
run
in
safety
at
the
third
rapid
we
saw
some
geese
but
they
got
away
at
noon
we
ate
a
cold
lunch
and
because
of
the
low
water
removed
the
skags
carrying
them
in
the
cockpit
the
scenery
in
upper
red
canyon
is
impressive
pines
and
fir
come
down
on
the
sloping
sides
to
the
river
edge
the
rocks
are
reddish
brown
in
colour
often
broken
in
squares
and
looking
like
great
building
blocks
piled
one
upon
another
the
canyon
is
about
fifteen
hundred
feet
deep
the
river
is
clear
again
and
averages
about
two
hundred
feet
in
width
we
have
seen
a
few
deer
tracks
but
have
not
seen
any
deer
we
also
saw
some
jumping
trout
in
a
splashy
little
rapid
doubtless
they
came
from
a
little
creek
close
by
for
we
never
heard
of
trout
being
found
in
the
green
river
we
made
a
motion
picture
while
dropping
our
boats
down
with
lines
over
the
first
rapid
we
considered
bad
emery
remained
in
the
boats
keeping
clear
of
the
rocks
with
a
pole
powell
second
party
records
an
upset
here
we
passed
kettle
creek
about
in
the
fifth
rapids
below
kettle
creek
i
got
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
river
and
was
carried
into
a
very
rocky
rapid
the
worst
so
far
encountered
i
touched
a
rock
or
two
at
the
start
but
made
the
run
in
safety
while
emery
ran
the
opposite
side
without
trouble
we
camped
beside
a
small
stream
on
the
south
where
there
were
signs
of
an
old
camp
september
clear
and
cold
in
the
early
morning
started
about
lined
our
boats
past
a
difficult
rapid
too
many
rocks
not
enough
water
two
or
three
miles
below
this
i
had
some
difficulty
in
a
rapid
as
the
pin
of
a
rowlock
lifted
out
of
the
socket
when
in
the
middle
of
rough
water
emery
snapped
a
picture
just
as
it
happened
a
little
later
ran
a
rocky
rapid
but
had
so
much
trouble
that
we
concluded
to
line
my
boat
noon
just
a
cold
lunch
but
with
hot
coffee
from
the
vacuum
bottles
then
at
it
again
the
scenery
is
wonderful
the
canyon
is
deeper
than
above
the
river
is
swift
and
has
a
decided
drop
we
proceed
cautiously
and
make
slow
progress
we
camp
for
the
day
on
the
north
side
close
to
a
little
dry
gully
on
a
level
sage
and
covered
bottom
back
from
the
river
edge
an
abruptly
descending
canyon
banked
with
small
cottonwood
trees
coming
in
from
the
opposite
side
contains
a
small
stream
put
up
our
tent
for
the
second
time
since
leaving
green
river
wyoming
we
are
all
weary
and
glad
is
sunday
a
day
of
rest
september
and
i
follow
a
fresh
deer
track
up
a
game
trail
and
get
a
rabbit
climb
out
about
feet
above
the
river
to
the
top
of
the
narrow
canyon
here
is
a
sloping
plateau
dotted
with
and
a
fourth
of
a
mile
wide
then
rounded
mountains
rise
beyond
the
plateau
some
of
the
peaks
reaching
a
height
of
feet
above
the
river
the
opposite
side
is
much
the
same
but
with
a
wider
plateau
we
had
no
idea
before
what
a
wonderful
country
this
is
it
is
a
picture
to
tempt
an
artist
high
on
the
mountain
tops
is
the
dark
of
pines
and
firs
reds
and
yellows
are
mixed
in
the
quaking
aspen
for
the
frost
comes
early
enough
to
catch
the
sap
in
the
leaves
little
openings
or
parks
with
no
trees
are
tinted
a
beautiful
soft
gray
fronts
are
found
in
the
canyon
walls
and
a
very
light
green
in
the
cottonwoods
at
the
river
edge
and
in
all
side
canyons
where
there
is
a
running
stream
the
river
glistens
in
the
sunlight
as
it
winds
around
the
base
of
the
wall
on
which
we
stand
and
then
disappears
around
a
bend
in
the
canyon
turn
where
we
will
we
see
no
sign
of
an
opening
nothing
but
the
rounded
tops
of
wooded
mountains
red
and
green
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
until
they
disappear
in
the
hazy
blue
finally
emery
keen
eyes
aided
by
the
binoculars
discover
a
log
cabin
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
on
the
plateau
opposite
us
about
three
miles
away
we
hurry
back
to
camp
and
write
some
letters
then
jim
and
i
cross
the
river
and
climb
out
over
the
rocky
walls
to
the
plateau
above
in
two
hours
we
reach
the
cabin
it
is
new
not
yet
finished
a
woman
and
four
children
are
looking
over
a
garden
when
we
arrive
they
are
a
little
frightened
at
first
but
soon
recover
the
woman
gladly
promises
to
take
out
our
mail
when
they
go
to
the
nearest
town
which
happens
to
be
vernal
utah
miles
away
three
other
families
live
near
by
all
recently
moved
in
from
vernal
the
woman
tells
us
that
galloway
hunts
bear
in
these
timbered
mountains
and
has
killed
some
with
a
price
on
their
heads
bear
with
a
perverted
taste
for
fresh
beef
thanking
the
woman
we
make
our
way
back
to
the
river
we
see
some
elk
horns
along
our
trail
though
it
is
doubtful
if
elk
get
this
far
south
at
present
a
deer
trail
leading
down
a
ravine
makes
our
homeward
journey
much
easier
it
has
turned
quite
cold
this
evening
after
sunset
we
finish
our
notes
and
prepare
to
roll
into
our
beds
a
little
earlier
than
usual
chapter
iv
suspicious
hosts
we
awoke
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
much
refreshed
by
our
day
of
rest
and
variety
with
an
early
start
we
were
soon
pulling
down
the
river
and
noon
found
us
several
miles
below
the
camp
having
run
eleven
rapids
with
no
particular
difficulty
a
reference
in
my
notes
reads
last
one
has
a
thousand
rocks
and
we
could
not
miss
them
all
my
rowing
is
improving
and
we
both
got
through
fairly
well
in
the
afternoon
they
continued
to
come
an
endless
succession
of
small
rapids
with
here
and
there
a
larger
one
the
canyon
was
similar
to
that
at
our
camp
above
dark
red
walls
with
occasional
pines
on
the
ledges
a
most
charming
combination
of
colour
at
we
reached
ashley
falls
a
rapid
we
had
been
expecting
to
see
for
some
time
it
was
a
place
of
singular
beauty
a
dozen
immense
rocks
had
fallen
from
the
cliff
on
the
left
almost
completely
blocking
the
channel
or
so
it
seemed
from
one
point
of
view
but
there
was
a
crooked
channel
not
more
than
twelve
wide
in
places
through
which
the
water
shot
like
a
stream
from
a
nozzle
we
wanted
a
motion
picture
of
our
dash
through
the
chute
but
the
location
for
the
camera
was
hard
to
secure
for
a
sheer
bank
of
rock
or
low
wall
prevented
us
from
climbing
out
on
the
right
side
we
overcame
this
by
landing
on
a
little
bank
at
the
base
of
the
wall
and
by
dropping
a
boat
down
with
a
line
to
the
head
of
the
rapid
where
a
break
occurred
in
the
wall
jimmy
was
left
with
the
camera
the
boat
was
pulled
back
and
we
prepared
to
run
the
rapid
we
first
had
to
pass
between
two
square
rocks
rising
eight
feet
above
the
water
so
close
together
that
we
could
not
use
the
oars
then
when
past
these
pull
ten
feet
to
the
right
in
order
to
clear
the
large
rock
at
the
end
of
the
main
dam
or
barrier
not
more
than
twenty
feet
below
to
pull
down
bow
first
and
try
to
make
the
turn
would
mean
to
smash
broadside
against
this
rock
it
could
only
be
done
by
dropping
stern
first
and
pulling
to
the
right
under
the
protection
of
the
first
rocks
though
it
was
doubtful
if
even
this
could
be
accomplished
the
current
was
so
swift
the
was
ready
first
the
was
to
follow
as
closely
as
safety
allowed
almost
before
i
knew
it
i
was
in
the
narrow
channel
so
close
to
the
right
rock
that
i
had
to
ship
that
oar
and
pull
altogether
on
the
left
one
as
soon
as
i
was
through
i
made
a
few
quick
strokes
but
the
current
was
too
strong
for
me
and
a
corner
of
the
stern
struck
a
bang
when
i
was
almost
clear
she
paused
as
a
wave
rolled
over
the
decks
then
rose
quickly
a
side
current
caught
the
boat
whirling
it
around
and
the
bow
struck
i
was
still
pulling
with
all
my
might
but
everything
happened
so
quickly
with
the
boat
whirling
first
this
way
then
that
that
my
efforts
were
almost
useless
but
after
that
second
strike
i
did
get
in
a
few
strokes
and
pulled
into
the
quiet
pool
below
the
line
of
boulders
emery
held
his
boat
in
better
position
than
i
had
done
and
it
looked
for
a
while
as
if
he
would
make
it
but
the
struck
on
the
stern
much
as
mine
had
done
then
he
pulled
clear
and
joined
me
in
the
shelter
of
the
large
rock
as
cool
and
smiling
as
if
he
had
been
rowing
on
a
we
were
delighted
to
find
that
our
boats
had
suffered
no
damage
from
the
blows
they
had
received
striking
on
the
ends
as
they
did
the
shock
was
distributed
throughout
the
whole
boat
this
completed
our
run
for
that
day
and
we
went
into
camp
just
below
the
falls
emery
painted
the
name
on
the
bow
of
his
boat
at
this
camp
the
name
was
given
in
honour
of
his
daughter
waiting
for
us
at
the
grand
canyon
i
remarked
that
as
no
one
loved
me
i
would
name
my
boat
the
but
i
hesitated
about
putting
this
name
on
the
bow
i
would
look
rather
foolish
i
thought
if
the
should
be
wrecked
in
the
first
bad
rapid
so
the
christening
of
my
boat
was
left
until
such
time
as
should
have
earned
the
title
although
she
was
constantly
referred
to
as
the
we
remained
until
noon
of
the
following
day
at
ashley
falls
exploring
repairing
and
photographing
this
picturesque
spot
the
canyon
walls
here
dropped
down
to
beautiful
rolling
eight
or
nine
hundred
feet
high
tree
covered
as
before
but
more
open
the
diversity
of
rocks
and
hills
was
alluring
there
was
work
to
be
done
and
no
pleasanter
spot
could
be
found
in
which
to
do
it
among
other
things
that
had
to
be
looked
after
were
some
adjustments
to
the
camera
usually
referred
to
by
us
as
the
this
delicate
work
always
falling
to
emery
for
he
alone
could
do
it
there
was
much
to
interest
us
here
major
powell
reported
finding
the
name
ashley
painted
under
an
overhanging
rock
on
the
left
side
of
the
river
underneath
was
a
date
rather
indistinct
but
found
to
have
been
by
dellenbaugh
after
carefully
tracing
the
career
of
colonel
ashley
who
was
responsible
for
the
record
accompanied
by
a
number
of
trappers
he
made
the
passage
through
this
canyon
at
that
early
day
we
found
a
trace
of
the
record
there
were
three
letters
the
first
two
quite
distinct
and
underneath
were
black
spots
it
must
have
been
pretty
good
paint
to
leave
a
trace
after
years
resuming
our
journey
we
passed
into
deep
canyon
again
the
deepest
we
had
found
up
to
this
time
with
steeply
sloping
walls
about
feet
high
the
rapids
still
continued
at
one
rapid
the
remark
was
made
that
two
feet
of
water
would
cover
two
hundred
rocks
so
that
our
boats
would
pass
over
them
but
we
did
not
have
the
two
feet
needed
we
had
previously
been
informed
that
some
of
these
mountains
were
the
of
men
who
were
wanted
in
the
three
states
which
bordered
near
here
some
escaping
prisoners
had
also
been
traced
to
the
mountains
in
this
direction
then
all
tracks
had
ceased
the
few
peaceable
ranchers
who
lived
in
these
mountains
were
much
alarmed
over
these
reports
we
found
one
such
rancher
on
the
plateau
above
the
canyon
whom
we
will
call
johnson
for
convenience
living
in
one
of
the
upper
canyons
he
sold
us
some
provisions
in
return
he
asked
us
to
help
him
swim
some
of
his
horses
across
the
river
he
said
the
high
water
had
taken
out
his
own
boat
the
horses
were
rounded
up
in
a
valley
and
driven
into
the
water
ahead
of
the
boat
after
securing
the
horses
johnson
welcome
seemed
to
turn
to
suspicion
and
he
questioned
our
reasons
for
being
there
wanting
to
know
what
we
could
find
in
that
wild
country
to
interest
us
sons
of
whom
there
were
several
seemed
to
put
in
most
of
their
time
at
hunting
and
trapping
never
leaving
the
house
without
a
gun
the
cabin
home
looked
like
an
arsenal
revolvers
and
guns
hanging
on
all
the
walls
even
his
daughters
being
familiar
with
their
use
although
we
had
been
very
well
treated
after
all
johnson
especially
having
been
very
kind
to
us
we
felt
just
a
little
relieved
when
the
johnson
ranch
was
left
behind
we
use
in
fact
a
fictious
name
not
caring
to
visit
on
them
the
suspicions
we
ourselves
felt
in
return
another
morning
passed
in
repairing
the
camera
and
another
afternoon
work
was
necessary
to
get
us
out
of
the
walls
and
the
rapids
of
red
canyon
but
on
the
evening
of
the
we
did
get
out
and
pulled
into
an
open
country
known
as
brown
park
one
week
after
entering
flaming
gorge
it
had
not
been
very
fast
travelling
but
we
were
through
and
with
no
mishap
more
serious
than
a
split
board
on
the
side
of
my
boat
under
favourable
conditions
and
in
experienced
hands
this
distance
might
have
been
covered
in
three
days
but
meanwhile
we
were
gaining
a
lot
of
experience
about
the
lower
end
of
red
canyon
the
river
turned
directly
east
paralleling
the
northern
boundary
of
utah
and
continued
to
flow
in
this
general
direction
until
it
crossed
into
colorado
on
emerging
from
red
canyon
we
spied
a
ranch
house
or
log
cabin
close
to
the
river
the
doors
were
open
and
there
were
many
tracks
in
the
sand
so
we
thought
some
one
must
be
about
on
approaching
the
house
however
we
found
the
place
was
deserted
but
with
furniture
books
and
pictures
piled
on
the
floor
in
the
utmost
confusion
as
if
the
occupants
had
left
in
a
great
hurry
this
surmise
afterward
proved
to
be
correct
for
we
learned
that
the
rancher
had
been
murdered
for
his
money
his
body
having
been
found
in
a
boat
farther
down
the
river
suspicion
pointed
to
an
old
employee
who
had
been
seen
lurking
near
the
place
he
was
traced
to
the
railroad
over
a
hundred
miles
to
the
north
but
made
his
escape
and
was
never
caught
we
found
brown
park
once
known
as
brown
hole
to
be
a
beautiful
valley
several
miles
in
width
and
or
forty
miles
in
length
the
upper
end
of
the
valley
was
rugged
in
places
with
rocky
hills
two
or
three
hundred
feet
high
to
the
south
a
few
miles
away
were
the
mountains
a
continuation
of
those
we
had
come
through
we
saw
many
cattle
scattered
over
some
of
these
rocky
hills
grazing
on
the
at
one
place
our
course
led
us
through
a
little
canyon
about
two
miles
long
and
scarcely
more
than
two
hundred
feet
deep
this
was
swallow
canyon
a
name
suggested
by
the
many
birds
of
that
species
which
had
covered
the
canyon
walls
with
their
little
clay
nests
the
openings
of
some
of
these
nests
were
so
small
that
it
scarcely
seemed
possible
for
a
bird
to
enter
the
water
was
deep
and
quiet
in
this
short
canyon
and
a
hard
wind
blowing
up
the
stream
made
it
difficult
for
us
to
gain
any
headway
in
this
case
too
the
forms
of
the
boat
were
against
us
with
the
keel
removed
and
with
their
high
sides
catching
the
wind
they
were
carried
back
and
forth
like
small
balloons
well
we
could
put
up
with
it
for
a
while
for
those
very
features
would
prove
most
valuable
in
the
canyons
which
were
to
follow
emerging
from
the
canyon
at
last
we
saw
a
ferry
loaded
with
sheep
crossing
the
stream
on
the
left
shore
was
a
large
corral
also
filled
with
sheep
which
a
half
dozen
men
were
driving
back
and
forth
into
different
compartments
later
these
men
told
us
there
were
sheep
in
the
flock
we
took
their
word
for
it
making
no
attempt
to
count
them
the
foreman
of
the
ranch
agreed
to
sell
us
some
sugar
and
honey
these
two
articles
being
a
welcome
addition
to
our
list
of
supplies
which
were
beginning
to
show
the
effects
of
our
voracious
appetites
we
found
many
other
log
cabins
and
ranches
as
we
proceeded
some
of
them
were
deserted
at
others
men
were
busily
engaged
in
cutting
hay
or
the
wild
grass
that
grew
in
the
bottoms
the
fragrance
of
hay
was
in
the
air
young
boys
and
women
were
among
these
busy
workers
some
of
the
women
being
seated
on
large
harvesters
handling
the
horses
with
as
much
dexterity
as
any
of
the
men
the
entire
trip
through
this
pretty
valley
was
full
of
interest
we
were
hailed
from
the
shore
by
some
of
the
hay
ranchers
it
being
a
novel
sight
to
them
to
see
a
river
expedition
at
one
or
two
of
these
places
we
asked
the
reason
for
the
deserted
ranches
above
and
were
given
evasive
answers
finally
we
were
told
that
cattle
rustlers
from
the
mountains
made
it
so
hard
for
the
ranchers
in
the
valleys
that
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
but
get
out
they
told
us
also
that
we
were
fortunate
to
get
away
from
johnson
ranch
with
our
valuables
our
former
host
we
were
told
had
committed
many
depredations
and
had
served
one
term
for
cattle
stealing
officers
disguised
as
prospectors
had
taken
employment
with
him
and
helped
him
kill
and
skin
some
cattle
the
skins
with
their
telltale
brands
having
been
partially
burned
and
buried
on
this
evidence
he
was
afterwards
convicted
our
cool
welcome
by
the
johnsons
their
suspicions
of
us
the
sinister
arsenal
of
guns
and
pistols
all
was
explained
quite
likely
some
of
these
weapons
had
been
trained
against
us
by
the
trappers
on
the
chance
that
we
were
either
officers
of
the
law
or
competitors
in
the
industry
for
that
matter
we
were
actually
guilty
of
the
latter
count
for
come
to
think
of
it
we
ourselves
had
helped
them
steal
eight
horses
and
a
colt
the
entire
trip
through
this
pretty
valley
was
full
of
interest
it
was
all
so
different
from
anything
seen
above
there
were
great
bottoms
that
gave
evidence
of
having
recently
been
overflooded
though
now
covered
with
cottonwood
trees
gorgeous
in
their
autumn
foliage
we
had
often
wondered
where
all
the
driftwood
that
floated
down
the
colorado
came
from
but
after
seeing
those
unnumbered
acres
of
cottonwoods
we
ceased
to
wonder
there
were
many
beaver
slides
on
the
banks
and
in
places
numberless
trees
had
been
felled
by
these
industrious
animals
on
one
or
two
occasions
we
narrowly
escaped
splitting
the
sides
of
our
boats
on
snags
of
trees
which
the
beavers
had
buried
in
the
bottom
of
the
stream
we
saw
no
beaver
dams
on
the
river
they
were
not
necessary
for
deep
quiet
pools
existed
everywhere
in
brown
park
we
saw
two
beavers
in
this
section
one
of
these
rose
to
the
top
of
the
water
stared
at
us
a
moment
then
brought
his
tail
down
with
a
resounding
smack
on
the
top
of
the
water
and
disappeared
to
enter
his
home
by
the
subterranean
route
no
doubt
the
river
was
gradually
losing
its
clear
colour
for
the
were
beginning
to
work
out
or
break
making
the
water
quite
roily
in
some
sections
of
brown
park
we
grounded
on
these
making
it
necessary
for
us
to
get
out
into
the
water
pushing
and
pulling
on
the
boats
until
deeper
water
was
reached
sometimes
the
deep
water
came
when
least
expected
the
having
a
disconcerting
way
of
dropping
off
abruptly
on
the
downstream
side
jimmy
stepped
off
the
edge
of
one
of
these
hidden
ledges
while
working
with
a
boat
and
was
for
some
time
in
no
condition
to
appreciate
our
mirth
often
we
would
be
passing
along
on
perfectly
smooth
water
when
suddenly
a
turmoil
would
rise
all
about
us
as
though
a
geyser
had
broken
out
below
the
surface
if
we
happened
to
be
directly
over
it
the
boat
would
be
rocked
back
and
forth
for
a
while
then
all
would
be
peaceful
again
this
was
most
often
caused
by
the
ledges
of
sand
anywhere
from
three
to
ten
feet
high
breaking
down
or
falling
forward
as
their
bases
were
undermined
in
a
single
night
a
bar
of
this
kind
will
work
upstream
for
a
distance
of
several
feet
then
the
sand
will
be
carried
down
with
the
current
to
lodge
again
in
some
quiet
pool
and
again
be
carried
on
as
before
this
action
gives
rise
to
long
lines
of
regular
waves
or
swells
extending
for
some
distance
down
the
stream
these
are
usually
referred
to
as
these
waves
increase
in
size
in
high
water
and
the
monotonous
thump
thump
of
the
boat
bottom
upon
them
is
anything
but
pleasant
especially
if
one
is
trying
to
make
fast
time
so
with
something
new
at
every
turn
we
pulled
lazily
through
park
shooting
at
ducks
and
geese
when
we
came
near
them
snapping
our
cameras
when
a
picture
presented
itself
and
observing
the
animal
life
along
the
stream
we
stopped
at
one
close
to
the
line
and
chatted
awhile
with
the
workers
a
woman
named
chew
asked
us
to
deliver
a
message
at
a
ranch
a
mile
or
two
below
here
also
was
the
of
lodore
colorado
located
a
short
distance
above
the
canyon
of
the
same
name
chew
informed
us
that
they
had
another
ranch
at
the
lower
end
of
lodore
canyon
and
asked
us
to
look
them
up
when
we
got
through
remarking
you
may
have
trouble
you
know
two
of
my
sons
once
tried
it
they
lost
their
boat
had
to
climb
out
and
nearly
starved
before
they
reached
home
the
at
the
ranch
found
as
described
without
another
home
in
sight
was
a
welcome
sight
to
us
for
several
reasons
one
reason
was
that
it
afforded
shelter
from
a
heavy
downpour
of
rain
that
greeted
us
as
we
neared
it
and
a
better
reason
still
was
that
it
gave
us
a
chance
to
write
and
mail
some
letters
to
those
who
would
be
most
anxious
to
hear
from
us
among
the
messages
we
mailed
was
a
picture
of
coney
island
at
night
in
some
way
this
card
had
slipped
between
the
leaves
of
a
book
that
i
had
brought
from
the
east
i
sent
it
out
addressed
to
a
friend
who
would
understand
the
joke
writing
underneath
the
picture
we
have
an
abundance
of
such
scenery
here
the
young
woman
who
had
charge
of
the
office
looked
at
the
card
in
amazement
it
was
evidently
something
new
to
her
she
told
us
she
had
never
been
to
the
railroad
and
that
her
brother
took
the
mail
out
on
to
steamboat
colorado
miles
distant
the
rain
having
ceased
we
returned
to
our
boats
pausing
to
admire
a
rainbow
that
arched
above
the
canyon
in
the
mountains
toward
which
we
were
headed
we
remarked
jokingly
to
jimmy
that
this
was
a
good
sign
he
replied
without
smiling
that
he
hoped
so
jimmy
songs
had
long
since
ceased
and
we
suspected
him
of
homesickness
with
the
exception
of
a
short
visit
to
some
friends
on
a
large
ranch
jimmy
had
never
been
away
from
his
home
in
san
francisco
this
present
experience
was
quite
a
contrast
to
be
sure
we
did
what
we
could
to
keep
him
cheered
up
but
with
little
success
jimmy
had
intimated
that
he
would
prefer
to
leave
at
the
first
opportunity
to
reach
a
railroad
and
we
willingly
agreed
to
help
him
in
every
possible
way
emery
and
i
also
agreed
between
ourselves
that
we
would
not
take
any
unnecessary
risks
with
him
but
would
leave
him
out
of
the
boats
at
all
rapids
if
there
was
any
passage
around
them
the
river
had
taken
a
sharp
turn
to
the
south
soon
after
passing
the
heading
directly
towards
the
mountains
camp
was
pitched
just
above
the
mouth
of
lodore
this
canyon
bears
a
very
unsavory
reputation
having
a
descent
of
feet
in
that
short
distance
the
greater
part
of
the
fall
occurring
in
a
space
of
twelve
miles
this
would
mean
wild
water
somewhere
we
were
camped
on
a
spot
recently
occupied
by
some
engineers
of
the
united
states
conservation
department
who
had
been
trying
to
determine
if
it
was
feasible
to
dam
the
river
at
this
place
the
plan
was
to
flood
the
hole
of
brown
park
and
divert
the
water
through
the
mountains
by
a
tunnel
to
land
suitable
for
cultivation
and
in
addition
allow
the
muddy
water
to
settle
and
so
prevent
the
vast
amount
of
silt
from
being
washed
on
down
eventually
to
the
mouth
of
the
colorado
the
location
seemed
admirably
suited
for
this
stupendous
project
but
holes
drilled
beside
the
river
failed
to
find
bottom
as
nothing
but
quicksand
existed
even
at
a
depth
of
nearly
three
hundred
feet
and
without
a
strong
foundation
such
a
dam
would
be
utterly
useless
chapter
v
the
battle
with
lodore
camp
routine
was
hurriedly
disposed
of
the
next
morning
saturday
september
the
everything
was
made
snug
beneath
the
hatches
except
the
two
guns
which
were
too
long
to
go
under
the
decks
and
had
to
be
carried
in
the
open
cockpits
camp
no
at
the
head
of
lodore
as
it
is
entered
in
my
journal
was
soon
hidden
by
a
bend
in
the
river
the
open
country
with
its
pleasant
ranches
and
its
grazing
cattle
its
rolling
gray
hills
and
its
wild
grass
and
bottoms
was
left
behind
and
we
were
back
in
the
realm
of
the
canyon
and
frowning
cliffs
with
pines
and
cedars
clutching
at
the
scanty
ledges
we
paused
long
enough
to
make
a
picture
or
two
with
the
hope
that
the
photographic
record
would
give
to
others
some
idea
of
the
geological
and
scenic
wonder
said
to
be
the
greatest
known
example
of
its
kind
which
lay
before
us
here
is
an
obstructing
mountain
raised
directly
in
the
river
path
yet
with
no
deviation
whatever
the
stream
has
cut
through
the
very
centre
of
the
peak
the
walls
are
almost
sheer
especially
at
the
the
bottom
and
are
quite
close
together
at
the
top
a
mile
inside
the
mountain
on
the
left
or
east
side
of
the
gorge
is
feet
high
geologists
say
that
the
river
was
here
first
and
that
the
mountain
was
slowly
raised
in
its
pathway
so
slowly
that
the
river
could
saw
away
and
maintain
its
old
channel
the
quicksand
found
below
the
present
level
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
walls
were
once
even
higher
than
at
present
and
that
a
subsidence
had
taken
place
after
the
cutting
the
river
at
the
entrance
of
this
canyon
was
nothing
alarming
four
small
rapids
being
passed
without
event
then
a
fifth
was
reached
that
looked
worse
the
was
lined
down
this
was
hard
work
and
dangerous
too
owing
to
the
strength
of
the
current
and
the
many
rocks
so
i
concluded
that
my
own
boat
the
must
run
the
rapid
jimmy
went
below
with
a
on
a
rope
emery
stood
beside
the
rapid
with
a
camera
and
made
a
picture
as
i
shot
past
him
fortunately
i
got
through
without
mishap
i
refused
to
upset
even
to
please
my
brother
we
were
beginning
to
think
that
lodore
was
not
so
bad
after
all
rapid
followed
rapid
in
quick
succession
and
all
were
run
without
trouble
then
we
came
to
a
large
one
it
was
upper
disaster
falls
so
named
by
major
powell
for
it
was
here
that
one
of
his
boats
was
wrecked
on
his
first
voyage
of
exploration
this
boat
failed
to
make
the
landing
above
the
rapid
and
was
carried
over
she
struck
a
rock
broadside
turned
around
and
struck
again
breaking
the
boat
completely
in
two
this
boat
was
built
of
oak
reënforced
with
bulkheads
when
this
fact
is
taken
into
consideration
some
idea
may
be
had
of
the
great
power
of
these
rapids
the
three
men
who
occupied
the
boat
saved
themselves
by
reaching
an
island
a
short
distance
below
this
all
happened
on
a
stage
of
water
much
higher
than
the
present
one
so
we
did
not
let
the
occurrence
influence
us
one
way
or
the
other
except
to
make
us
careful
to
land
above
the
rapid
we
found
a
very
narrow
channel
between
two
submerged
boulders
the
water
plunging
and
foaming
for
a
short
distance
below
over
many
hidden
rocks
still
there
was
only
one
large
rock
near
the
lower
end
that
we
greatly
feared
and
by
careful
work
that
might
be
avoided
the
went
first
and
grazed
the
boulder
slightly
but
no
harm
was
done
as
held
his
boat
well
in
hand
i
followed
and
struck
rocks
at
the
same
instant
on
both
sides
of
the
narrow
channel
with
my
oars
it
will
be
remembered
that
we
ran
all
these
dangerous
rapids
facing
downstream
the
effect
of
this
was
to
shoot
the
ends
of
both
oars
up
past
my
face
the
operator
said
that
i
made
a
grimace
just
as
he
took
a
picture
of
the
scrimmage
we
landed
on
the
island
below
and
talked
of
camping
for
the
night
as
it
was
getting
late
but
the
island
so
rocky
and
inhospitable
that
we
concluded
to
try
the
lower
part
of
the
rapid
this
had
no
descent
like
the
upper
end
but
it
was
very
shallow
and
we
soon
found
ourselves
on
rocks
unable
to
proceed
any
farther
it
took
an
hour
of
hard
labour
to
work
our
heavy
boats
safely
to
the
shore
we
had
been
hoping
for
a
rest
the
next
day
sunday
but
the
island
was
such
a
disagreeable
place
to
camp
that
it
seemed
necessary
to
cross
to
the
mainland
at
least
a
coil
of
strong
pliable
wire
had
been
included
in
our
material
here
was
a
chance
to
use
it
to
advantage
the
stream
on
the
left
side
of
the
island
could
be
waded
although
it
was
very
swift
and
we
managed
to
get
the
wire
across
and
well
fastened
at
both
ends
elevating
the
wire
above
the
water
with
our
tent
and
camp
material
were
run
across
on
a
pulley
and
camp
was
pitched
a
hundred
yards
below
on
the
left
shore
of
the
river
there
were
fitful
showers
in
the
afternoon
and
we
rested
from
our
labour
obtaining
a
great
deal
of
comfort
from
our
tent
which
was
put
up
here
for
the
third
time
since
leaving
green
river
city
always
when
the
weather
was
clear
we
slept
in
the
open
monday
the
found
us
at
the
same
camp
having
concluded
that
disaster
falls
was
an
ideal
place
for
a
moving
picture
we
sent
the
balance
of
the
material
across
on
the
pulley
and
wire
making
a
picture
of
the
operation
stopping
often
because
it
continued
to
shower
between
showers
we
resumed
our
work
and
picture
making
the
picture
was
to
have
been
concluded
with
the
operation
of
lining
the
boat
across
stood
on
the
shore
about
sixty
feet
away
working
with
the
camera
jimmy
was
on
the
island
paying
out
the
rope
while
i
waded
in
the
water
holding
the
bow
of
the
boat
as
i
worked
her
between
the
rocks
having
reached
the
end
of
the
rope
i
coiled
it
up
advising
jimmy
to
go
up
to
a
safe
crossing
and
join
my
brother
while
i
proceeded
with
the
boat
all
was
going
well
and
i
was
nearing
the
shore
when
i
found
myself
suddenly
carried
off
my
feet
into
water
beyond
my
depth
and
drifting
for
the
lower
end
of
the
rapid
meanwhile
i
was
holding
to
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
calling
lustily
to
my
brother
to
save
me
at
first
he
did
not
notice
that
anything
was
wrong
as
he
was
looking
intently
through
the
finder
then
he
suddenly
awoke
to
the
fact
that
something
was
amiss
and
came
running
down
the
shore
but
he
could
not
help
me
as
we
had
neglected
to
leave
a
rope
with
him
things
were
beginning
to
look
pretty
serious
when
the
boat
stopped
against
a
rock
and
i
found
myself
once
more
with
solid
footing
under
me
it
was
too
good
a
picture
to
miss
and
i
found
the
operator
at
the
machine
turning
the
crank
as
i
climbed
out
we
developed
some
films
and
plates
that
evening
securing
some
satisfactory
results
from
these
tests
it
continued
to
rain
all
that
night
with
intermittent
showers
next
morning
the
rain
made
little
difference
to
us
for
we
were
in
the
water
much
of
the
following
day
as
he
boats
were
taken
along
the
edge
of
another
unrunnable
rapid
a
good
companion
rapid
for
the
one
just
passed
this
was
lower
disaster
falls
the
first
of
many
similar
rapids
we
were
to
see
but
this
was
one
of
the
worst
of
its
kind
the
river
found
its
channel
blocked
by
the
canyon
wall
on
the
right
side
the
cliff
running
at
right
angles
to
the
course
of
the
stream
the
river
attacking
the
limestones
had
cut
a
channel
under
the
wall
then
turned
and
ran
with
the
wall
emerging
about
two
hundred
feet
below
standing
on
a
rock
and
holding
one
end
of
a
foot
string
we
threw
a
stone
attached
to
the
other
end
across
to
the
opposite
wall
the
overhanging
wall
was
within
two
feet
of
the
rushing
river
a
higher
stage
of
water
would
hide
the
cut
completely
from
view
think
what
would
happen
if
a
boat
were
carried
against
or
under
that
wall
we
thought
of
it
many
times
as
we
carefully
worked
our
boats
along
the
shore
between
the
delays
of
rain
with
stops
for
picture
making
portaging
our
material
and
lining
our
boats
we
spent
almost
three
days
in
getting
past
the
rapids
called
upper
and
lower
disaster
falls
with
their
combined
fall
of
feet
in
little
more
than
half
a
mile
on
the
evening
of
september
the
we
camped
almost
within
sight
of
this
same
place
at
the
base
of
a
mountain
on
the
right
from
top
to
bottom
things
were
going
too
easily
for
us
it
seemed
but
we
were
in
for
a
few
reverses
it
stormed
much
of
the
night
and
still
drizzled
when
we
embarked
on
the
following
morning
the
narrow
canyon
was
gloomy
and
darkened
with
shreds
of
clouds
drifting
far
below
the
rim
the
first
rapid
was
narrow
and
contained
some
large
boulders
the
was
caught
on
one
of
these
and
turned
on
her
side
so
that
the
water
flowed
in
filling
the
cockpit
the
boat
was
taken
off
without
difficulty
and
bailed
out
we
found
that
the
bulkheads
failed
to
keep
the
water
out
of
the
hatches
some
material
from
the
was
transferred
to
the
a
bed
in
a
protecting
sack
of
rubber
and
canvas
was
shoved
under
the
seat
and
we
proceeded
less
than
an
hour
later
i
repeated
my
brother
performance
but
i
was
not
so
fortunate
as
he
the
was
carried
against
one
rock
as
i
tried
to
pull
clear
of
another
and
in
an
instant
she
was
on
her
side
held
by
the
rush
of
water
i
caught
the
gunwale
and
climbing
on
to
the
rock
that
caused
the
disaster
i
managed
to
catch
the
rope
and
held
the
boat
in
the
meantime
emery
was
in
a
whirlpool
below
trying
to
land
on
the
right
side
but
was
having
a
difficult
time
of
it
jimmy
stood
on
the
shore
unable
to
help
the
bed
was
washed
out
of
the
boat
and
went
bobbing
over
the
waves
then
before
i
knew
what
had
happened
the
rope
was
jerked
from
my
hands
and
i
was
left
stranded
on
my
rock
seeing
this
jimmy
ran
with
all
his
might
for
a
pool
at
the
end
of
the
rapid
bravely
rescuing
the
boat
and
the
bed
as
well
just
as
the
was
landed
a
rope
was
soon
thrown
to
me
after
the
inevitable
picture
was
made
then
i
jumped
and
was
pulled
to
shore
on
making
an
inventory
we
found
that
our
guns
were
lost
from
the
boat
being
too
long
to
go
under
the
hatches
they
had
been
left
in
the
cockpit
the
had
an
ugly
rap
on
the
bottom
where
she
struck
a
rock
the
wood
being
smashed
or
jammed
but
not
broken
out
nearly
all
material
in
the
two
boats
was
wet
so
we
took
everything
out
and
piled
it
on
a
piece
of
canvas
spread
out
on
the
sand
we
worked
rapidly
for
another
storm
had
been
threatening
all
the
morning
we
were
engaged
in
putting
up
our
little
tent
when
a
violent
wind
which
swept
up
the
canyon
followed
by
a
downpour
of
rain
interrupted
our
work
and
if
anything
missed
a
soaking
before
it
certainly
received
it
then
the
sand
was
beaten
into
our
cameras
and
everything
was
scattered
over
the
shore
we
were
fortunate
in
only
one
respect
the
wind
was
away
from
the
river
instead
of
toward
it
we
finally
got
the
tent
up
then
threw
everything
into
it
in
an
indiscriminate
pile
and
waited
for
the
storm
to
pass
emery
proposed
that
we
do
a
song
and
dance
just
to
show
how
good
we
felt
but
any
appearance
of
merriment
was
rather
forced
had
the
builders
of
the
boats
been
there
we
fear
they
would
have
had
an
uncomfortable
for
nearly
all
this
loss
could
have
been
avoided
had
our
instructions
regarding
the
hatch
covers
been
followed
and
for
the
sake
of
their
saving
a
few
dollars
we
had
to
suffer
the
rain
soon
passed
and
we
went
to
work
first
starting
a
fire
and
getting
a
hurried
lunch
for
we
had
not
eaten
our
noon
meal
and
it
was
then
we
put
up
our
tent
then
went
to
work
to
find
what
was
saved
and
what
was
lost
we
were
surprised
to
find
that
all
our
small
films
and
plates
had
escaped
a
soaking
protected
in
tin
and
cardboard
boxes
wrapped
with
adhesive
tape
and
covered
with
a
coating
of
paraffine
melted
and
poured
over
them
they
had
turned
the
water
in
nearly
every
instance
the
film
was
not
so
fortunate
the
paraffine
had
worn
off
the
tin
boxes
in
spots
the
water
soaked
through
the
tape
in
some
instances
and
entered
to
the
film
one
roll
tightly
wrapped
became
wet
on
the
edges
the
gelatine
swelled
and
stuck
to
the
other
film
thus
sealing
the
inner
portion
or
picture
part
of
the
film
so
that
roll
was
saved
the
camera
was
filled
with
water
mud
and
sand
and
the
other
cameras
fared
likewise
we
cleaned
them
out
as
best
we
could
drying
them
over
small
alcohol
lamp
which
we
had
included
in
our
duffle
our
job
seemed
endless
jimmy
had
retired
early
for
he
could
help
us
but
little
in
this
work
it
rained
again
in
torrents
and
the
wind
howled
about
the
tent
after
midnight
as
we
still
toiled
a
loosened
by
the
soaking
rains
thundered
down
the
mountain
side
about
a
fourth
of
a
mile
below
our
camp
we
hoped
jimmy
would
not
hear
it
we
retired
soon
after
this
smaller
slides
followed
at
intervals
descending
over
the
precipices
thunder
reverberated
through
the
canyon
and
altogether
it
was
a
night
long
to
be
remembered
these
slides
made
one
feel
a
little
uncomfortable
it
would
be
most
inconvenient
as
we
have
heard
some
one
say
to
wake
in
the
morning
and
find
ourselves
wrapped
up
in
a
few
tons
of
earth
and
rock
emery
woke
me
the
next
morning
to
report
that
the
river
had
risen
about
six
feet
and
that
my
boat
rolled
out
on
the
sand
but
left
untied
was
just
on
the
point
of
going
out
with
the
water
it
had
proven
fortunate
for
us
all
emery
was
a
light
sleeper
there
was
no
travelling
this
day
as
the
boat
had
to
be
repaired
emery
being
the
ship
carpenter
set
to
work
at
once
while
jimmy
and
i
stretched
our
ropes
back
and
forth
and
hung
up
the
wet
clothes
then
we
built
a
number
of
fires
underneath
and
soon
had
our
belongings
in
a
steam
things
were
beginning
to
look
cheerful
again
the
rain
stopped
too
for
a
time
at
least
a
little
later
jimmy
ran
into
camp
with
a
fish
which
he
had
caught
with
his
hands
it
was
of
the
kind
commonly
called
the
or
humpback
or
a
peculiar
species
found
in
many
of
the
rivers
of
the
southwest
it
is
distinguished
by
a
small
flat
head
with
a
hump
directly
behind
it
the
end
of
the
body
being
round
very
slender
and
equipped
with
large
this
specimen
was
about
sixteen
inches
long
the
usual
length
for
a
fish
of
this
species
now
for
a
fish
story
on
going
down
to
the
river
we
found
a
great
many
fish
swimming
in
a
small
whirlpool
evidently
trying
to
escape
from
the
thick
slimy
mud
which
was
carried
in
the
water
in
a
we
secured
fourteen
fish
killing
most
of
them
with
our
oars
there
were
suckers
and
one
catfish
in
the
lot
you
can
judge
for
yourself
how
thick
the
water
was
that
such
mudfishes
as
these
should
have
been
choked
to
helplessness
our
captured
fish
were
given
a
bath
in
a
bucket
of
and
we
had
a
fish
dinner
in
the
afternoon
we
made
a
test
of
the
water
from
the
river
and
found
that
it
contained
per
cent
of
an
alkaline
silt
when
we
had
to
use
this
water
we
bruised
the
leaf
of
a
prickly
pear
cactus
and
placed
it
in
a
bucket
of
water
this
method
repeated
two
or
three
times
usually
clears
the
muddiest
water
we
also
dug
holes
in
the
sand
at
the
side
of
the
river
the
water
filtering
through
the
sand
was
often
clear
enough
to
develop
the
tests
we
made
with
our
films
jimmy
continued
to
feel
downhearted
and
this
afternoon
he
told
us
his
story
our
surmise
about
his
being
homesick
was
correct
but
it
was
a
little
more
than
that
he
had
an
invalid
mother
it
seemed
and
aided
by
an
older
brother
he
had
always
looked
after
the
needs
of
the
family
when
the
proposition
of
making
the
river
trip
came
up
serious
objections
were
raised
by
the
family
but
when
the
transportation
arrived
he
had
determined
to
go
in
spite
of
their
objections
now
he
feared
that
his
mother
would
not
live
or
that
we
would
be
wrecked
and
he
would
not
know
where
to
turn
or
what
to
do
no
wonder
he
felt
blue
all
we
could
do
was
to
promise
to
help
him
leave
the
river
at
the
very
first
opportunity
this
would
quite
likely
be
at
jensen
utah
still
fifty
miles
farther
downstream
it
continued
to
rain
by
spells
that
night
and
the
next
morning
about
we
resumed
our
work
on
the
river
a
short
distance
below
our
camp
we
saw
the
which
we
heard
the
night
before
tons
of
earth
and
shattered
rock
wrapped
about
the
split
and
stripped
trunks
of
a
pines
the
slide
was
started
by
the
dislodged
section
of
a
sheer
wall
close
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
we
also
saw
a
boat
of
crude
construction
pulled
above
the
mark
evidently
abandoned
a
great
while
before
any
person
who
had
to
climb
the
walls
at
that
place
had
a
hard
job
to
tackle
although
we
could
pick
out
breaks
where
it
looked
feasible
there
were
a
few
places
behind
us
where
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
we
had
only
gone
over
a
few
rapids
when
we
found
a
long
pool
with
driftwood
eddying
upstream
and
knew
that
our
run
for
the
day
was
over
the
triplet
rapids
were
ahead
of
us
we
found
this
rapid
to
be
about
a
fourth
of
a
mile
long
divided
into
three
sections
as
its
name
indicated
and
filled
with
great
boulders
at
the
base
of
a
sheer
cliff
on
the
right
another
unrunnable
rapid
taking
the
camp
material
from
the
boats
we
carried
it
down
and
pitched
our
tent
first
of
all
then
while
emery
prepared
supper
jimmy
and
i
carried
the
remaining
duffle
down
to
camp
one
of
the
boats
was
lined
down
also
then
after
supper
we
enjoyed
the
first
rest
we
had
taken
for
some
time
camp
ideal
we
called
it
and
it
well
deserved
the
name
at
the
bottom
of
a
precipice
reaching
a
height
of
feet
was
a
strip
of
firm
level
sand
tapering
off
with
a
slope
down
to
the
water
making
a
perfect
landing
and
dooryard
a
great
mass
of
driftwood
piled
up
at
the
end
of
the
rapid
furnished
us
with
all
fuel
we
needed
with
small
effort
on
our
part
our
tent
was
backed
against
a
large
rock
while
other
flat
rocks
near
at
hand
made
convenient
shelves
on
which
to
lay
our
camp
dishes
and
kettles
it
started
to
drizzle
again
that
night
but
what
cared
we
with
a
roaring
fire
in
front
of
the
tent
we
all
cleaned
up
for
a
change
sewed
patches
on
our
tattered
garments
and
sitting
on
our
beds
wrote
the
day
happenings
in
our
journals
then
we
crawled
into
our
comfortable
beds
and
i
was
soon
dreaming
of
my
boyhood
days
when
i
played
hookey
from
school
and
went
fishing
in
a
creek
that
emptied
into
the
allegheny
river
or
climbed
its
rocky
banks
to
be
awakened
by
jimmy
crying
out
in
his
sleep
there
she
goes
over
the
rapids
jimmy
was
soon
informed
that
he
and
the
boats
were
perfectly
safe
and
i
was
brought
back
to
a
realization
of
the
fact
that
i
was
not
going
to
get
a
whaling
for
going
swimming
in
but
instead
was
holed
up
in
lodore
canyon
in
the
extreme
northwestern
corner
of
colorado
chapter
vi
hell
half
mile
we
began
our
work
the
next
morning
where
we
left
off
the
night
before
by
bringing
the
remaining
boat
down
along
the
edge
of
the
triplets
then
while
emery
cooked
the
breakfast
jimmy
and
i
broke
camp
the
beds
came
first
the
air
had
been
released
from
the
mattresses
before
we
got
up
one
way
of
saving
time
a
change
of
dry
clothing
was
placed
with
each
bed
and
they
were
rolled
as
tightly
as
the
two
of
us
could
do
it
after
which
they
were
strapped
placed
in
a
rubber
sack
with
a
canvas
sack
over
that
both
these
sacks
being
laced
at
the
top
the
tent
one
of
those
balloon
silk
compositions
made
a
very
small
roll
the
tent
with
its
three
plies
of
cloth
made
the
largest
bundle
of
the
lot
everything
had
been
taken
from
the
boats
and
made
quite
a
pile
of
dunnage
when
it
was
all
collected
in
a
pile
ready
for
loading
after
the
dishes
were
washed
they
were
packed
in
a
box
the
pots
and
pans
being
placed
in
a
sack
everything
was
sorted
and
piled
before
the
loading
commenced
an
equal
division
of
nearly
everything
was
made
so
that
the
loss
of
one
boat
and
its
cargo
would
only
partially
cripple
the
expedition
the
photographic
plates
and
films
in
protecting
canvas
sacks
were
first
disposed
of
being
stored
in
the
hatches
in
the
bow
of
the
boats
two
of
the
smaller
rolls
containing
bedding
or
clothing
a
sack
of
flour
and
half
of
the
cameras
completed
the
loads
for
the
forward
compartments
five
or
six
tin
and
wooden
boxes
filled
with
provisions
went
into
the
large
compartments
under
the
stern
a
box
containing
tools
and
hardware
for
the
inevitable
repairs
and
the
weightier
provisions
such
as
canned
milk
and
canned
meats
went
in
first
this
served
as
ballast
for
the
boats
then
the
other
provisions
followed
the
remaining
rolls
of
bedding
and
tents
being
squeezed
in
on
top
this
compartment
with
careful
packing
would
hold
as
much
as
two
trunks
but
squeezing
it
all
in
through
the
small
hatchway
or
opening
on
top
was
not
an
easy
job
one
thing
we
guarded
very
carefully
from
this
time
on
was
a
waterproofed
sack
containing
sugar
the
muddy
water
had
entered
the
top
of
this
sack
in
our
upset
and
a
liquefied
sugar
or
syrup
was
used
in
our
coffee
and
on
our
breakfast
foods
after
that
it
gradually
dried
out
and
our
emptied
cups
would
contain
a
sediment
of
mud
in
the
bottom
such
was
our
morning
routine
although
it
was
not
often
that
everything
was
taken
from
the
boats
and
it
only
happened
in
this
case
because
we
made
a
portage
the
night
before
our
work
was
all
undone
an
hour
later
when
we
came
to
the
sharp
descent
known
as
hell
half
mile
a
section
of
a
cliff
had
fallen
from
above
and
was
shattered
into
a
hundred
fragments
large
and
small
gigantic
rocks
were
scattered
on
both
shores
and
through
the
river
bed
not
an
orderly
array
of
rocks
such
as
that
found
at
ashley
falls
but
a
riotous
mass
looking
as
though
they
had
been
hurled
from
the
sky
above
the
stripped
trunk
of
an
tree
with
roots
extending
over
the
river
had
been
deposited
by
a
recent
flood
on
top
of
the
principal
barrier
all
this
was
found
about
fifty
yards
below
the
beginning
of
the
most
violent
descent
in
lodore
canyon
it
would
have
been
difficult
enough
without
this
last
complication
the
barrier
seemed
next
to
insurmountable
tired
and
handicapped
with
heavy
boats
as
we
were
with
a
weary
sigh
we
dropped
our
boats
to
the
head
of
the
rapid
and
prepared
to
make
the
portage
our
previous
work
was
as
nothing
to
this
rounded
limestone
boulders
hard
as
flint
and
covered
with
a
thin
slime
of
mud
from
the
recent
rise
caused
us
to
slip
and
fall
many
times
then
we
dragged
ourselves
and
loads
up
the
sloping
walls
they
were
cut
with
gullies
from
the
recent
rains
low
scraggy
cedars
caught
at
our
loads
or
tore
our
clothes
as
we
staggered
along
the
muddy
earth
stuck
to
our
shoes
or
caused
our
feet
to
slip
from
under
us
as
we
climbed
first
two
or
three
hundred
feet
above
the
water
then
close
to
the
river
edge
of
a
mile
of
such
work
brought
us
a
level
place
below
the
rapid
it
took
nine
loads
to
empty
one
boat
darkness
came
on
before
our
boats
were
emptied
so
they
were
securely
tied
in
quiet
water
at
the
head
of
the
rapid
and
left
for
the
morning
the
next
day
found
emery
and
me
at
work
on
the
boats
while
jimmy
was
stationed
on
the
shore
with
the
camera
this
wild
scene
with
its
score
of
shooting
currents
was
too
good
a
view
to
miss
with
inflated
and
adjusted
emery
sat
in
the
boat
at
the
oars
pulling
against
the
current
lessening
the
velocity
with
which
the
boat
was
carried
down
toward
the
main
barrier
while
i
followed
on
the
shore
holding
a
rope
and
dropped
him
down
a
little
at
a
time
until
the
water
became
too
rough
and
the
rocks
too
numerous
all
directions
were
given
with
signals
the
human
voice
was
of
little
avail
in
the
turmoil
we
kept
the
boats
in
the
water
as
long
as
it
was
safe
to
do
so
for
it
greatly
lessened
the
hard
work
of
a
portage
with
one
end
of
the
boat
floating
on
the
water
an
ordinary
lift
would
take
the
other
end
over
a
rock
with
insufficient
water
above
it
to
float
the
boat
then
the
boat
was
balanced
on
the
rock
the
opposite
end
was
lifted
she
was
shoved
forward
and
dropped
in
the
water
again
and
another
threatening
rock
was
passed
foot
by
foot
we
fought
our
way
now
on
the
shore
now
waist
deep
in
the
water
below
some
protecting
boulder
threatened
every
moment
by
the
whirling
water
that
struggled
to
drag
us
into
the
torrent
the
sand
and
water
collecting
in
our
clothes
weighted
us
down
the
chill
of
standing
in
the
cold
water
numbed
our
limbs
finally
the
barrier
was
reached
and
the
boats
were
run
out
close
to
the
end
and
tied
in
a
quiet
pool
while
we
devised
some
method
of
getting
them
past
or
over
this
obstruction
directly
underneath
and
beyond
the
roots
of
the
tree
were
large
rounded
boulders
covered
with
slippery
mud
past
this
barrier
the
full
force
of
the
water
raced
to
hurl
itself
and
divide
its
current
against
another
rock
it
was
useless
to
try
to
take
a
boat
around
the
end
of
the
rock
the
boat
sides
of
an
inch
thick
would
be
crushed
like
a
cardboard
box
if
lifted
into
the
groove
the
weight
of
the
boats
would
wedge
them
and
crush
their
sides
fortunately
an
upright
log
was
found
tightly
wedged
between
these
boulders
a
strong
limb
with
one
end
resting
on
a
rock
opposite
was
nailed
to
this
log
a
triangle
of
stout
sticks
with
the
point
down
was
placed
opposite
this
first
limb
on
the
same
level
and
was
fastened
to
the
upright
log
with
still
another
piece
and
another
difficulty
was
overcome
with
a
short
rope
fastened
to
the
iron
bar
or
on
the
stern
this
end
was
lifted
on
to
the
the
bow
sticking
into
the
water
at
a
sharp
angle
the
short
rope
was
tied
to
the
stump
so
we
would
not
lose
that
we
had
gained
the
longer
rope
from
the
bow
was
thrown
over
the
roots
of
the
tree
above
then
we
both
pulled
on
the
rope
until
finally
the
bow
was
on
a
level
with
the
stern
she
was
pulled
forward
the
ropes
were
loosened
and
the
boat
rested
on
the
the
camera
was
transferred
so
as
to
command
a
view
of
the
lower
side
of
the
barrier
then
the
boat
was
carefully
tilted
and
slid
forward
a
little
at
a
time
until
she
finally
gained
headway
nearly
jerking
the
rope
from
our
hands
and
shot
into
the
pool
below
we
enjoyed
the
wildest
ride
we
had
experienced
up
to
this
time
in
running
the
lower
end
of
this
rapid
the
balance
of
the
day
was
spent
in
the
same
camp
below
the
rapid
our
tent
was
put
up
in
a
group
of
box
elder
trees
the
first
trees
of
this
species
we
had
seen
red
cedar
trees
dotted
the
rocky
slopes
while
the
larger
pines
became
scarce
at
the
river
edge
and
gathered
near
the
top
of
the
walls
the
dark
red
rocks
near
the
bottom
were
covered
with
a
light
stratum
of
limestone
similar
to
the
fallen
rocks
found
in
the
rapid
above
in
one
evidently
struck
with
some
rolling
rock
lay
the
body
of
a
small
deer
we
saw
many
mountain
sheep
tracks
but
failed
to
see
the
sheep
many
dead
fish
their
gills
filled
with
the
slimy
mud
from
the
recent
rise
floated
past
us
or
lay
half
buried
in
the
mud
these
things
were
noticed
as
we
went
about
our
duties
for
we
were
too
weary
to
do
any
exploring
the
next
morning
monday
october
the
saw
us
making
arrangements
for
the
final
run
that
would
take
us
out
of
lodore
canyon
no
doubt
it
was
a
beautiful
and
a
wonderful
place
but
none
of
us
seemed
sorry
to
leave
it
behind
for
ten
days
we
had
not
had
a
single
day
entirely
free
from
rain
and
instead
of
having
a
chance
to
run
rapids
it
seemed
as
if
we
had
spent
an
entire
week
in
carrying
our
loads
or
in
lining
our
boats
through
the
canyon
the
canyon
walls
lost
much
of
their
precipitous
character
as
we
neared
the
end
of
the
canyon
a
short
run
took
us
over
the
few
rapids
that
remained
and
at
a
turn
ahead
we
saw
a
ridge
brilliantly
tinted
in
many
colours
light
and
golden
yellows
orange
and
red
purple
and
lavender
and
composed
of
numberless
layers
of
rock
uptilted
so
that
the
broken
ends
looked
like
the
spines
of
a
gigantic
fish
back
a
sharp
turn
to
the
left
soon
brought
us
to
the
end
of
this
ridge
close
to
the
bottom
of
a
smooth
sheer
wall
across
a
wide
level
point
of
sand
we
could
see
a
large
stream
the
yampa
river
flowing
from
the
east
to
join
its
waters
with
those
of
the
green
this
was
the
end
of
lodore
canyon
chapter
vii
jimmy
goes
over
the
mountain
the
yampa
or
bear
river
was
a
welcome
sight
to
us
in
spite
of
its
disagreeable
whitish
yellow
clay
colour
quite
different
from
the
red
water
of
the
green
river
the
new
stream
meant
more
water
in
the
channel
something
we
needed
badly
as
our
past
tribulations
showed
the
recent
rise
on
the
green
had
subsided
a
little
but
we
now
had
a
much
higher
stage
than
when
we
entered
lodore
quite
likely
the
new
conditions
gave
us
six
feet
of
water
above
the
low
water
on
which
we
had
been
travelling
would
it
increase
or
diminish
our
dangers
we
were
willing
emery
and
i
even
anxious
to
risk
our
chances
on
the
higher
water
directly
opposite
the
yampa
the
right
shore
of
the
green
went
up
sheer
about
feet
high
indeed
it
seemed
to
overhang
a
trifle
this
had
been
named
echo
cliffs
by
powell
party
the
cliffs
gave
a
remarkable
echo
repeating
seven
words
plainly
when
shouted
from
the
edge
of
the
yampa
a
hundred
yards
away
and
would
doubtless
repeat
more
if
shouted
from
the
farther
shore
of
the
yampa
echo
cliffs
we
found
were
in
the
form
of
a
peninsula
and
terminated
just
below
this
point
where
we
stood
the
river
doubling
back
on
the
other
side
of
the
cliff
on
the
left
side
of
the
river
the
walls
fell
back
leaving
a
flat
level
space
of
about
acres
here
was
a
little
ranch
of
which
chew
had
told
us
the
chew
ranch
lay
back
from
the
river
on
top
of
the
cliffs
we
found
no
one
at
home
here
at
this
first
ranch
but
there
was
evidence
of
recent
habitation
there
were
a
few
peach
trees
and
a
small
garden
while
beyond
this
were
two
buildings
little
shacks
in
a
dilapidated
condition
the
doors
were
off
their
hinges
and
leaned
against
the
building
a
few
logs
being
placed
against
the
doors
past
the
dooryard
coming
out
of
a
small
canyon
above
the
ranch
ran
a
little
brook
up
this
canyon
was
a
trail
the
outlet
to
the
ranch
above
we
camped
near
the
mouth
of
the
stream
it
had
been
agreed
upon
the
night
before
that
we
should
endeavour
to
make
arrangements
to
have
jimmy
taken
out
on
horseback
over
the
mountains
before
looking
for
the
ranch
however
we
asked
him
if
he
did
not
wish
to
reconsider
his
decision
to
leave
here
we
pointed
out
that
jensen
utah
was
only
fifty
miles
away
half
that
distance
being
in
quiet
water
and
that
the
worst
canyon
was
behind
us
but
he
said
he
had
enough
of
the
river
and
preferred
to
see
what
could
be
done
while
i
busied
myself
about
camp
he
and
emery
left
for
the
ranch
about
seven
that
evening
they
returned
in
great
spirits
they
had
found
the
ranch
without
any
trouble
nearly
three
miles
from
our
camp
chew
was
there
and
gave
them
a
hearty
welcome
she
had
often
wondered
what
had
become
of
us
she
invited
the
boys
to
remain
for
supper
which
they
did
they
talked
over
the
matter
of
transportation
for
jimmy
as
luck
would
have
it
chew
was
going
to
drive
over
to
jensen
and
vernal
utah
in
two
days
time
and
agreed
to
take
jimmy
along
early
the
next
morning
two
boys
one
about
fourteen
years
old
the
other
a
little
older
rode
down
from
the
ranch
some
of
their
horses
were
pastured
across
the
river
and
they
had
come
after
these
after
a
short
visit
they
got
into
the
with
emery
and
prepared
to
cross
over
to
the
pasture
which
was
a
mile
or
more
downstream
they
were
soon
out
of
our
sight
jimmy
and
i
remained
at
the
camp
taking
pictures
packing
his
belongings
and
finding
many
odd
jobs
to
be
done
in
about
three
hours
the
boys
returned
with
their
horses
the
horses
were
quite
gentle
and
they
had
no
difficulty
in
swimming
them
across
a
young
colt
too
feeble
to
swim
placed
its
fore
feet
on
its
mother
flanks
and
was
ferried
across
in
that
way
then
they
were
driven
over
a
narrow
trail
skirting
the
cliff
feet
above
the
river
no
one
looking
from
the
river
would
have
imagined
that
any
trail
over
which
horses
could
be
driven
existed
the
boys
informed
us
that
we
were
expected
at
the
ranch
for
dinner
and
would
listen
to
no
refusal
so
up
we
went
although
we
would
have
to
make
a
second
trip
that
day
the
view
of
the
ranch
was
another
of
those
wonderful
scenic
changes
which
we
were
to
meet
with
everywhere
in
this
region
the
flat
on
which
we
stood
was
simply
a
pocket
shut
in
by
the
mountains
with
a
pass
or
an
opening
to
the
east
side
a
small
stream
ran
down
a
mountain
side
spreading
over
the
rocks
and
glistening
in
the
sunlight
this
same
stream
passed
the
ranch
and
ran
on
down
through
the
narrow
canyon
up
which
we
had
come
the
ranch
itself
was
refreshing
the
buildings
were
new
some
were
under
construction
but
there
was
considerable
ground
under
cultivation
cattle
were
scattered
up
the
valley
or
dotted
the
rocky
slopes
below
the
mountains
a
wild
spot
this
on
the
borderland
of
the
three
states
none
but
people
of
fortitude
or
even
of
daring
would
think
of
taking
up
a
homestead
in
this
secluded
spot
the
same
rumours
of
the
escaped
prisoners
had
drifted
in
here
it
was
chew
who
gave
us
the
information
we
have
previously
quoted
concerning
the
murdered
man
he
had
found
the
body
in
the
boat
in
front
of
the
he
further
stated
that
others
in
the
mountains
would
not
hesitate
at
anything
to
drive
out
those
who
were
trying
to
improve
a
homestead
as
he
was
doing
and
that
it
was
a
common
event
to
find
the
carcasses
of
his
own
horses
or
cattle
which
had
been
ruthlessly
slaughtered
this
was
the
reason
for
putting
the
horses
across
the
river
there
they
were
safe
for
none
could
approach
them
save
by
going
past
the
ranch
or
coming
through
lodore
canyon
chew
also
told
us
of
the
snyders
who
had
lost
their
boat
in
upper
lodore
canyon
and
of
how
he
had
given
them
a
horse
and
provisions
to
aid
them
in
reaching
the
settlements
this
did
not
prevent
the
elder
snyder
from
coming
back
to
trap
the
next
year
much
to
disgust
he
thought
one
experience
should
be
enough
for
any
man
while
we
were
talking
a
very
old
bearded
man
rode
in
on
a
horse
he
was
pat
lynch
the
owner
of
the
little
ranch
by
the
river
he
was
a
real
having
been
in
brown
park
when
major
powell
was
surveying
that
section
of
the
country
he
told
us
that
he
had
been
hired
to
get
some
meat
for
the
party
and
had
killed
five
mountain
sheep
he
was
so
old
that
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
rambling
from
one
subject
to
another
and
would
have
us
listening
with
impatience
to
hear
the
end
of
some
wonderful
tale
of
the
early
days
when
he
would
suddenly
switch
off
on
to
an
entirely
different
subject
leaving
the
first
unfinished
in
spite
of
his
years
he
was
quite
active
having
broken
the
horses
on
which
he
rode
bareback
without
assistance
we
were
told
that
he
placed
a
spring
or
trap
gun
in
his
houses
at
the
river
ready
to
greet
any
prying
marauder
the
last
we
saw
of
him
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
miles
away
to
draw
his
pension
for
service
in
the
civil
war
returning
to
the
transportation
of
jimmy
it
was
settled
that
the
chews
were
to
leave
early
the
next
morning
they
also
agreed
to
take
out
our
exposed
films
and
plate
for
us
something
we
had
not
counted
on
but
too
good
a
chance
to
lose
we
all
three
returned
to
the
boats
and
packed
the
stuff
that
was
to
go
out
then
went
back
to
the
ranch
with
jimmy
it
was
late
after
midnight
when
we
reached
there
and
we
did
not
disturb
any
one
jimmy
blankets
were
unrolled
in
the
wagon
so
there
would
be
no
question
about
his
going
out
he
was
to
go
to
jensen
or
vernal
and
there
await
us
keeping
our
films
until
we
arrived
we
knew
they
were
in
good
hands
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
we
found
our
way
back
to
our
camp
the
trail
was
difficult
and
it
was
pitch
dark
my
boat
had
been
taken
down
to
where
emery
left
the
when
the
horses
were
driven
across
and
this
extra
distance
was
added
to
our
walk
we
were
laggard
the
next
morning
and
in
no
hurry
to
resume
our
work
we
rearranged
our
loads
in
the
boats
with
one
less
man
and
considerable
less
baggage
as
well
they
were
lighter
by
far
our
chances
looked
much
more
favourable
for
an
easier
passage
not
only
were
these
things
in
our
favour
but
in
addition
we
felt
that
we
had
served
our
apprenticeship
at
navigation
in
rapid
water
and
we
were
just
as
capable
of
meeting
the
rapids
to
follow
as
if
we
had
years
of
experience
to
our
record
on
summing
up
we
found
that
the
river
had
dropped
feet
since
leaving
green
river
wyoming
and
that
feet
remained
to
put
us
on
a
level
with
the
ocean
our
difficulties
would
depend
of
course
on
how
this
fall
was
distributed
most
of
the
fall
behind
was
found
in
lodore
and
red
canyons
it
was
doubtful
indeed
if
any
section
would
have
a
more
rapid
fall
than
lodore
canyon
there
is
a
certain
verse
of
wisdom
which
says
that
pride
goeth
before
a
fall
but
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
for
us
if
we
were
a
little
bit
elated
by
our
past
achievements
as
long
as
we
had
to
go
through
with
the
balance
of
our
task
confidence
in
a
proper
degree
is
a
great
help
when
real
difficulties
have
to
be
surmounted
we
were
full
of
confidence
that
day
when
we
pulled
away
about
noon
into
whirlpool
canyon
whirlpool
canyon
being
next
on
the
list
the
camp
we
were
about
to
leave
was
directly
opposite
lodore
canyon
where
it
ran
against
the
upended
cliff
the
gorgeous
colours
were
the
same
as
those
on
the
opposite
side
and
to
a
certain
degree
were
also
found
in
whirlpool
canyon
our
two
and
a
half
hours
dash
through
the
fourteen
miles
of
rapid
water
in
whirlpool
canyon
put
us
in
a
joyful
frame
of
mind
rapid
after
rapid
was
left
behind
us
without
a
pause
in
our
rowing
with
only
a
hasty
survey
standing
on
the
deck
of
the
boats
before
going
over
others
that
were
free
from
rocks
were
rowed
in
bow
first
the
big
waves
breaking
over
our
boats
and
ourselves
we
bailed
while
drifting
in
the
quiet
stretches
then
got
ready
for
the
next
rapids
two
large
rapids
only
were
looked
over
from
the
shore
and
these
were
run
in
the
same
manner
we
could
hardly
believe
it
was
true
when
we
emerged
from
the
mountain
so
quickly
into
a
little
flat
park
or
valley
sheltered
in
the
hills
this
was
island
or
rainbow
park
the
latter
name
being
suggested
by
the
brilliant
colouring
of
the
rocks
in
the
mountains
to
our
left
perhaps
the
form
of
the
rocks
themselves
helped
a
little
for
here
was
one
end
of
the
rainbow
of
rock
which
began
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
canyons
looking
almost
as
if
their
sides
had
been
rent
asunder
came
out
of
these
mountains
there
was
very
little
dark
red
here
except
away
on
top
feet
above
where
a
covering
of
pines
made
a
soft
background
for
and
gorgeous
pinnacles
or
rocky
walls
of
pink
and
purple
and
delicate
shades
of
various
hues
large
cottonwoods
appeared
again
along
the
river
banks
in
brilliant
autumn
colours
adding
to
the
beauties
of
the
scene
back
from
the
river
to
the
west
stretched
the
level
park
well
covered
with
on
which
some
cattle
grazed
an
occasional
small
prickly
pear
cactus
and
the
ever
present
pungent
sage
islands
dotted
the
course
of
the
stream
which
was
quiet
and
sluggish
doubling
back
and
forth
like
a
serpent
over
many
a
useless
mile
nine
miles
of
rowing
brought
us
back
to
a
point
about
three
miles
from
the
mouth
of
whirlpool
canyon
where
the
river
again
enters
the
mountain
deliberately
choosing
this
course
to
one
unobstructed
for
several
miles
to
the
right
the
next
gorge
was
split
mountain
canyon
so
named
because
the
stream
divided
the
ridge
from
one
end
to
the
other
it
was
short
only
nine
miles
long
with
a
depth
of
feet
in
the
centre
of
the
canyon
three
miles
of
the
nine
were
put
behind
us
before
we
camped
that
evening
these
were
run
in
the
same
manner
as
the
rapids
of
whirlpool
scarcely
pausing
to
look
them
over
but
these
rapids
were
bigger
much
bigger
one
we
thought
was
just
formed
or
at
least
increased
in
size
by
a
great
slide
of
rock
that
had
fallen
since
the
recent
rains
we
just
escaped
trouble
in
this
rapid
both
boats
going
over
a
large
rock
with
a
great
cresting
wave
below
and
followed
by
a
very
rough
rapid
emery
was
standing
on
top
of
a
rock
below
the
rapid
when
i
went
over
and
for
a
few
moments
could
see
nothing
of
my
boat
hardly
believing
it
possible
that
i
had
come
through
without
a
scratch
these
rapids
with
the
high
water
looked
more
like
rapids
we
had
seen
in
the
grand
canyon
and
were
very
unlike
the
shallow
water
of
a
week
previous
we
had
only
travelled
a
half
day
but
felt
as
if
it
had
been
a
very
complete
day
when
we
camped
at
the
foot
of
a
rock
slide
on
the
right
just
above
another
big
rapid
on
thursday
october
camp
no
was
left
behind
the
rapid
below
the
camp
was
big
big
enough
for
a
moving
picture
so
we
took
each
other
in
turns
as
we
ran
the
rapid
more
rapids
followed
but
these
were
not
so
large
a
few
spires
of
tinted
rock
lifted
above
us
a
thousand
feet
or
more
framed
in
with
the
branches
of
the
cottonwood
trees
they
made
a
charming
picture
less
than
three
hours
brought
us
to
the
end
of
split
mountain
canyon
and
the
last
bad
water
we
were
to
have
for
some
time
just
before
leaving
the
canyon
we
came
to
some
curious
grottos
or
alcoves
under
the
rock
walls
on
the
left
shore
the
river
has
cut
into
these
until
they
overhang
some
of
them
feet
or
over
in
one
of
these
was
a
beaver
lying
on
a
pile
of
floating
sticks
although
we
passed
quite
close
the
beaver
never
moved
and
we
did
not
molest
it
another
shower
greeted
us
as
we
emerged
into
the
uinta
valley
as
it
is
called
by
the
ute
indians
this
valley
is
miles
long
it
did
not
have
the
fertileness
of
brown
park
being
raised
in
bare
rolling
hills
runnelled
and
gullied
by
the
elements
the
water
was
quiet
here
and
hard
rowing
was
necessary
to
make
any
progress
we
had
gone
about
seven
miles
when
we
spied
a
large
placer
dredge
close
to
the
river
to
the
uninitiated
this
dredge
would
look
much
like
a
dredging
steamboat
out
of
water
but
digging
its
own
channel
which
is
what
it
really
does
great
beds
of
gravel
lay
on
either
side
of
the
river
and
placer
gold
in
large
or
small
quantities
but
usually
the
latter
is
likely
to
exist
in
these
beds
when
a
dredge
like
the
one
found
here
is
to
be
installed
an
opening
is
made
in
the
river
bank
leading
to
an
excavation
which
has
been
made
then
a
large
flatboat
is
floated
in
this
the
dredging
machinery
is
on
this
float
as
well
as
most
of
the
machinery
through
which
the
gravel
is
passed
accompanied
by
a
stream
of
water
then
with
quicksilver
and
rockers
of
various
designs
the
gold
is
separated
from
the
gravel
and
sand
numerous
small
buildings
were
standing
near
the
dredge
but
the
buildings
were
empty
and
the
dredge
lay
idle
we
saw
many
fresh
tracks
of
men
and
horses
aid
were
welcomed
by
a
sleek
cat
but
found
the
place
was
deserted
all
buildings
were
open
and
in
one
was
a
telephone
we
were
anxious
to
hear
just
where
we
were
so
we
used
the
telephone
and
explained
what
we
wanted
to
know
the
central
informed
us
that
we
were
about
nine
miles
from
jensen
so
we
returned
to
the
boats
and
pulled
with
a
will
through
a
land
that
was
no
longer
barren
but
with
cozy
ranch
houses
surrounded
by
rows
of
stately
poplars
bending
with
the
wind
for
it
was
storming
in
earnest
now
about
six
that
evening
we
caught
sight
of
the
top
of
the
jensen
bridge
then
as
we
neared
the
village
the
sun
broke
through
the
pall
of
cloud
and
mist
and
a
rainbow
appeared
in
the
sky
above
and
was
mirrored
in
the
swollen
stream
rainbow
and
replica
combined
nearly
completing
the
wondrous
arc
there
was
a
small
inn
beside
the
bridge
and
arrangements
were
made
for
staying
there
that
night
we
were
told
that
jim
and
chew
had
passed
through
jensen
about
four
hours
before
we
arrived
they
had
left
word
that
they
would
go
on
through
to
vernal
fifteen
miles
distant
from
the
river
chapter
viii
an
inland
excursion
jensen
was
a
small
village
with
two
stores
and
a
a
few
scattered
houses
completed
the
village
proper
but
ranches
spread
out
on
the
lowland
for
two
or
three
miles
in
all
directions
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
avenues
of
poplar
trees
fruit
trees
and
fields
of
alfalfa
gave
these
ranches
a
different
appearance
from
any
others
we
had
passed
we
found
some
mail
awaiting
us
at
the
and
were
soon
busily
engaged
in
reading
the
news
from
home
we
conversed
awhile
with
the
few
people
at
the
hotel
then
retired
but
first
made
arrangements
for
saddle
horses
for
the
ride
to
vernal
next
morning
we
found
two
spirited
animals
saddled
and
waiting
for
us
we
had
some
misgivings
concerning
these
horses
but
were
assured
that
they
were
all
right
a
group
of
grinning
cowboys
and
ranch
hands
craning
their
necks
from
a
barn
a
hundred
yards
distant
rather
inclined
us
to
think
that
perhaps
our
informant
might
be
mistaken
nothing
is
more
amusing
to
these
men
of
the
range
than
to
see
a
man
thrown
from
his
horse
and
a
horse
that
is
all
right
for
one
of
them
might
be
anything
else
to
persons
such
as
we
who
never
rode
anything
except
gentle
horses
and
rode
those
indifferently
we
mounted
quickly
though
trying
to
appear
unconcerned
the
horses
much
to
our
relief
behaved
quite
well
emery
mount
rearing
back
on
his
hind
legs
but
not
bucking
after
that
all
went
smoothly
leaving
the
irrigated
ranches
on
the
bottom
lands
we
ascended
a
low
rolling
mesa
composed
of
gravel
and
clay
unwatered
and
unfertile
from
which
we
caught
occasional
glimpses
of
the
mountains
and
the
gorge
from
which
we
had
emerged
their
brilliant
colours
softened
and
beautified
by
that
swimming
blue
haze
which
belongs
to
this
plateau
region
then
we
rode
down
into
the
beautiful
ashley
valley
watered
by
ashley
creek
a
stream
even
after
it
was
used
to
irrigate
all
the
country
for
miles
above
the
valley
was
several
miles
wide
the
stream
emptied
into
the
river
about
a
mile
below
jensen
all
parts
of
the
valley
were
under
cultivation
it
is
famous
for
its
splendid
deciduous
fruits
apples
pears
peaches
splendid
both
in
appearance
and
flavour
it
excelled
not
only
in
fruits
however
but
in
all
products
of
the
field
as
well
vernal
honey
which
is
marketed
far
and
near
has
a
reputation
for
fine
flavour
wherever
it
is
known
a
thick
growth
of
the
or
crowded
the
road
sides
and
hugged
the
fences
the
fragrance
of
the
flower
can
easily
be
noticed
in
the
sweetness
of
the
honey
the
pity
of
it
was
that
bushels
of
fruit
lay
rotting
on
the
ground
for
there
were
no
transportation
facilities
the
nearest
railroad
being
miles
distant
there
were
stock
ranches
too
with
blooded
stock
in
the
fields
some
of
the
splendid
horses
paced
along
beside
us
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
we
heard
the
rippling
song
of
some
this
day
the
only
birds
of
this
species
we
remember
having
seen
on
the
western
plateaus
all
these
ranches
were
laid
out
in
true
mormon
style
that
is
squared
off
in
sections
fenced
and
planted
with
before
being
worked
the
roads
are
usually
wide
and
the
streets
exceptionally
so
except
in
the
business
streets
a
large
garden
usually
surrounds
the
home
building
each
family
endeavouring
to
raise
all
their
own
vegetables
fruits
and
poultry
they
usually
succeed
the
shade
trees
about
vernal
were
lombardy
poplars
they
attained
a
height
that
would
give
ample
shade
under
most
conditions
and
too
much
when
we
were
there
for
the
roads
were
very
muddy
although
they
had
dried
in
all
other
sections
nearing
vernal
we
passed
nathan
galloway
home
a
cozy
place
set
back
some
distance
from
the
road
we
had
hoped
to
meet
galloway
and
have
an
opportunity
of
talking
over
his
experiences
with
him
but
found
he
was
absent
on
a
hunting
trip
in
fact
was
up
in
the
mountains
we
had
come
through
on
nearing
the
town
we
were
greeted
by
a
busy
scene
numerous
wagons
and
horses
stood
in
squares
reserved
for
that
purpose
or
were
tied
to
hitching
posts
in
front
of
the
many
stores
ranchers
and
their
families
were
everywhere
in
evidence
there
were
numerous
prospectors
in
their
boots
just
returning
from
the
mountains
and
oil
men
in
similar
garb
muddy
from
head
to
foot
later
we
learned
that
oil
had
recently
been
discovered
about
forty
miles
distant
this
fact
accounting
for
much
of
the
activity
the
town
itself
was
a
surprise
we
found
it
to
be
very
much
considering
its
isolated
position
two
of
the
streets
were
paved
and
oiled
and
were
supplied
with
drinking
fountains
there
were
two
prosperous
looking
banks
two
and
drug
stores
several
mercantile
stores
and
many
others
all
busy
many
of
the
buildings
were
of
brick
all
were
substantial
near
a
hotel
we
observed
a
group
of
men
surrounding
some
one
who
was
evidently
keeping
them
interested
on
approaching
them
we
found
it
was
jimmy
giving
a
graphic
description
of
some
of
our
difficulties
his
story
was
not
finished
for
he
saw
us
and
ran
to
greet
us
as
pleased
to
see
us
as
we
were
to
see
him
he
had
little
idea
we
would
be
along
for
two
or
three
days
and
naturally
was
much
surprised
on
entering
the
hotel
we
were
greeted
by
an
old
grand
canyon
friend
a
civil
engineer
named
duff
who
with
a
crew
of
men
had
been
mapping
the
mountains
near
whirlpool
canyon
you
can
imagine
that
it
was
a
gratifying
surprise
to
all
concerned
to
find
we
were
not
altogether
among
strangers
though
they
were
as
hospitable
as
strangers
could
be
the
hotel
was
a
lively
place
that
night
there
was
some
musical
talent
among
duff
men
and
duff
himself
was
an
artist
on
the
piano
many
of
the
young
people
of
the
town
had
dropped
in
that
evening
as
some
one
had
passed
the
word
that
there
might
be
an
impromptu
entertainment
at
the
hotel
there
was
duff
played
and
the
boys
sang
jimmy
was
himself
again
and
added
his
rich
baritone
the
town
itself
was
not
without
musical
talent
and
altogether
it
was
a
restful
change
for
us
perhaps
we
should
have
felt
even
better
if
we
had
been
dressed
differently
for
we
wore
much
the
same
clothes
as
those
in
which
we
did
our
work
on
the
river
a
woollen
shirt
and
overalls
besides
neither
emery
nor
i
had
shaved
since
starting
and
it
is
quite
likely
that
we
looked
just
a
little
uncouth
appearances
count
for
little
with
these
people
in
the
districts
and
it
is
a
common
enough
sight
to
them
to
see
men
dressed
as
we
were
they
did
everything
they
could
to
make
us
feel
at
ease
as
one
person
remarked
the
wealthiest
cattle
man
or
the
owner
of
the
richest
mine
in
the
country
usually
looks
worse
than
all
others
after
a
month
on
the
range
or
in
the
hills
if
wealth
were
indicated
on
an
inverse
ratio
to
one
good
appearance
we
should
have
been
very
wealthy
indeed
we
felt
as
if
it
would
take
us
a
week
to
get
rested
and
lost
little
time
in
getting
to
bed
when
the
party
broke
up
we
imagine
most
of
the
residents
of
vernal
were
mormons
it
is
part
of
their
creed
to
give
the
stranger
within
their
gates
a
cordial
welcome
this
however
was
accorded
to
us
not
only
among
the
mormons
but
in
every
section
of
our
journey
on
the
green
and
colorado
rivers
the
following
day
was
a
busy
one
arrangements
had
been
made
with
a
local
photographer
to
get
the
use
of
his
dark
room
and
we
proceeded
to
develop
all
plates
and
many
of
our
films
these
were
then
to
be
packed
and
shipped
out
we
were
informed
at
the
local
express
office
that
it
might
be
some
time
before
they
would
go
as
the
recent
rains
had
been
very
bad
in
colorado
and
had
washed
out
most
of
the
bridges
vernal
had
passenger
transportation
to
the
railway
a
branch
of
the
running
north
into
colorado
by
automobile
the
route
lying
across
the
green
and
also
across
the
white
river
a
tributary
to
the
green
a
steel
structure
had
been
washed
away
on
the
white
river
making
it
impossible
to
get
through
to
the
station
the
high
water
below
here
must
have
been
a
flood
judging
from
all
reports
about
ten
bridges
large
and
small
were
reported
as
being
washed
away
on
numerous
branch
streams
leading
into
the
green
river
fortunately
vernal
had
another
means
of
communication
this
was
a
stage
running
southwest
from
vernal
over
miles
of
rough
road
to
price
utah
price
being
a
station
on
the
main
line
of
the
jimmy
concluded
that
he
would
take
this
road
in
preference
to
the
uncertainties
of
the
other
route
and
noon
that
day
found
him
on
board
the
stage
he
promised
to
write
to
us
and
was
anxious
to
hear
of
our
success
but
remarked
that
when
he
once
got
home
he
would
never
leave
san
francisco
again
there
was
a
final
hand
clasp
a
cheer
from
the
small
group
of
men
and
the
stage
drove
away
with
jimmy
a
happy
boy
indeed
our
work
on
the
developing
progressed
well
and
with
very
satisfying
results
on
the
whole
and
that
evening
found
us
with
all
plates
packed
ready
for
shipment
to
our
home
the
film
was
also
packed
and
shipped
to
be
developed
at
once
this
was
quite
a
load
off
our
minds
the
following
day
we
prepared
to
depart
but
did
not
leave
until
the
afternoon
then
with
promises
to
let
them
know
the
outcome
of
our
venture
we
parted
from
our
friends
and
rode
back
to
jensen
we
planned
on
leaving
the
following
morning
the
river
had
fallen
one
foot
since
we
had
landed
and
we
were
anxious
to
have
the
benefit
of
the
high
water
we
were
told
that
it
was
six
feet
above
the
stage
of
two
weeks
before
on
monday
october
the
after
loading
our
boat
with
a
new
stock
of
provisions
in
which
was
included
few
jars
of
honey
and
a
few
dozen
of
eggs
packed
in
sawdust
we
began
what
might
be
called
the
second
stage
of
our
journey
the
run
to
blake
or
green
river
utah
a
little
west
of
south
from
jensen
ten
miles
below
jensen
was
a
ferry
used
by
the
auto
and
wagons
here
also
was
a
ranch
house
with
a
number
of
people
in
the
yard
we
were
invited
to
land
and
did
so
they
had
been
informed
by
telephone
of
our
coming
and
were
looking
for
us
indeed
they
had
even
prepared
dinner
for
us
hoping
we
would
reach
there
in
time
not
knowing
all
this
we
had
eaten
our
cold
lunch
half
an
hour
before
the
women
were
busy
preserving
fruits
and
garden
truck
and
insisted
on
us
taking
two
or
three
jars
along
this
was
a
welcome
change
to
the
dried
fruit
which
was
one
of
our
principal
foods
these
people
made
the
usual
request
drop
us
a
post
card
if
you
get
through
the
memory
of
these
people
that
we
met
on
this
journey
will
linger
with
us
as
long
as
we
live
they
were
always
anxious
to
help
us
or
cheer
us
on
our
way
we
passed
a
dredge
that
evening
and
saw
a
man
at
work
with
a
team
and
scoop
shovel
the
method
being
to
scoop
up
the
gravel
and
sand
then
dump
it
in
an
iron
car
this
was
then
pulled
by
the
horses
to
the
top
of
a
derrick
up
a
sloping
track
and
dumped
a
stream
of
water
pumped
up
from
the
river
mixed
with
the
gravel
the
entire
mass
descended
a
long
zigzagging
chute
we
paused
a
few
minutes
only
and
did
not
examine
the
complicated
process
of
separating
the
mineral
from
the
gravel
this
dredge
had
been
recently
installed
we
camped
early
half
a
mile
below
the
dredge
emery
had
been
feeling
poorly
all
this
day
he
blamed
his
indisposition
to
having
eaten
too
many
good
things
when
in
vernal
a
break
in
training
as
it
were
this
was
our
excuse
for
a
short
run
that
day
i
played
nurse
and
gave
him
some
simple
remedy
from
the
little
supply
that
we
carried
and
after
he
was
in
his
sleeping
bag
i
filled
some
bags
for
the
first
time
on
the
trip
and
soon
had
him
feeling
quite
comfortable
a
hard
wind
came
up
that
night
and
a
little
rain
fell
i
had
a
busy
keeping
our
camp
from
being
blown
away
the
storm
was
of
short
duration
and
all
was
soon
quiet
again
on
the
following
morning
emery
felt
so
good
that
i
had
a
hard
time
in
keeping
up
with
him
and
i
wondered
if
he
would
ever
stop
towards
evening
after
a
long
pull
we
neared
the
reservation
of
the
uinta
utes
and
saw
a
few
indians
camped
away
from
the
river
here
again
were
the
cottonwood
bottoms
banked
by
the
barren
gravelly
hills
we
had
been
informed
that
there
was
a
settlement
called
ouray
some
distance
down
the
river
and
we
were
anxious
to
reach
it
before
night
but
the
river
was
sluggish
with
devious
and
twisting
channels
and
it
was
dark
when
we
finally
landed
at
the
ouray
ferry
chapter
ix
canyon
of
desolation
ouray
utah
consisted
of
a
large
store
to
supply
the
wants
of
the
indians
and
ranchers
a
small
hotel
and
a
few
dwellings
the
agency
proper
was
located
some
distance
up
the
uinta
river
which
stream
emptied
into
the
green
just
below
ouray
supper
was
taken
at
the
hotel
after
which
we
visited
a
young
man
in
charge
of
the
store
looking
over
his
curios
and
listening
to
tales
of
his
life
here
among
these
indians
they
were
peaceable
enough
now
but
in
years
gone
by
were
a
danger
to
be
reckoned
with
we
slept
in
our
own
beds
close
to
our
boats
by
the
river
the
following
morning
when
we
were
ready
to
leave
a
small
crowd
gathered
a
few
indians
among
them
most
of
the
indians
were
big
fat
and
apparently
they
enjoyed
the
care
of
the
government
a
mile
below
we
passed
several
squaws
and
numerous
children
under
some
trees
while
on
a
high
mound
stood
a
lone
buck
indian
looking
at
us
as
we
sped
by
but
without
a
single
movement
that
we
could
see
he
still
stood
there
as
we
passed
from
sight
a
mile
below
it
might
be
interesting
if
one
could
know
just
what
was
in
his
mind
as
he
watched
us
a
mile
below
the
uinta
river
which
entered
on
the
west
we
passed
another
stream
the
white
river
entering
from
the
east
the
two
streams
adding
considerable
water
to
the
green
river
we
passed
another
idle
dredge
also
some
mineral
workings
in
tunnels
and
saw
two
men
camped
on
the
shore
beside
them
we
saw
numerous
indian
carvings
on
the
rocks
but
judged
they
were
recent
because
horses
figured
in
most
of
them
in
all
the
open
country
the
river
was
fringed
with
large
cottonwood
trees
alders
and
willow
thickets
a
number
of
islands
followed
one
of
them
very
symmetrical
in
shape
with
cottonwood
trees
in
the
centre
while
around
the
edge
ran
a
fringe
of
bushes
looking
almost
like
a
trimmed
hedge
the
autumn
colouring
added
to
its
beauty
the
hedge
as
we
called
it
was
dark
red
brown
yellow
and
green
the
cottonwoods
were
a
light
yellow
after
we
had
passed
this
island
a
deer
confused
by
our
voices
jumped
into
the
river
fifty
yards
behind
us
leaping
and
swimming
as
he
made
for
the
shore
we
had
no
gun
but
emery
had
the
camera
at
hand
and
turned
it
on
the
deer
the
hour
was
late
however
and
we
had
little
hopes
of
its
success
as
a
picture
the
country
back
from
the
river
stretched
in
rolling
barren
hills
or
feet
high
a
continuation
of
the
bad
lands
of
utah
which
lay
off
to
the
west
with
the
next
day
travel
the
hills
lost
some
of
their
barren
appearance
some
cattle
were
seen
early
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
we
passed
a
cattle
man
working
at
a
ferry
who
had
just
taken
some
stock
across
which
other
men
had
driven
on
ahead
he
was
busy
so
we
did
not
interrupt
him
merely
calling
to
him
from
the
boats
drifting
meanwhile
with
the
current
soon
we
saw
him
riding
down
the
shore
and
waited
for
him
to
catch
up
he
invited
us
to
camp
with
him
that
evening
remarking
that
he
had
just
killed
a
beef
we
thanked
him
but
declined
as
it
was
early
and
we
had
only
travelled
a
short
distance
that
day
we
chatted
awhile
and
he
told
us
to
look
out
for
rapids
ahead
he
was
rather
surprised
when
he
learned
that
we
had
started
at
green
river
wyoming
and
had
already
come
through
a
few
rapids
where
are
you
going
to
stop
he
then
asked
on
being
told
that
our
destination
was
needles
california
he
threw
up
his
hands
with
an
expressive
gesture
then
added
soberly
well
boys
i
sure
wish
you
luck
and
rode
back
to
his
camp
we
had
difficulty
in
making
a
suitable
landing
that
evening
as
the
high
water
had
deposited
great
quantities
of
black
mud
over
everything
making
it
very
disagreeable
when
we
left
the
boats
we
finally
found
a
place
with
less
mud
to
wade
through
than
on
most
of
the
banks
seen
and
tied
up
to
the
roots
of
a
tree
while
lying
in
our
beds
that
night
looking
at
the
starlit
sky
such
a
sky
as
is
found
only
on
these
high
plateaus
we
discovered
a
comet
directly
above
us
an
astronomer
would
have
enjoyed
our
opportunities
for
observing
the
heavens
no
doubt
this
comet
had
been
heralded
far
and
wide
but
we
doubt
if
any
one
saw
it
to
better
advantage
than
did
we
later
some
coyotes
possibly
in
chase
of
a
rabbit
gave
vent
to
their
yodeling
cry
and
awakened
us
from
a
sound
sleep
they
were
in
a
little
lateral
canyon
which
magnified
and
gave
a
weird
echo
to
their
calls
long
after
the
coyotes
themselves
had
passed
from
hearing
the
nights
were
getting
warmer
as
we
travelled
south
but
not
so
warm
that
we
were
bothered
with
insects
the
same
reason
accounted
for
the
absence
of
snakes
or
scorpions
for
no
doubt
there
were
plenty
of
both
in
warm
weather
in
this
dry
country
when
there
was
no
wind
the
silence
of
the
nights
was
impressive
with
no
sound
save
the
lapping
of
the
water
against
the
banks
sometimes
a
bird
in
the
trees
above
would
start
up
with
a
twitter
then
quiet
down
again
on
occasions
the
air
chambers
in
our
boats
would
contract
on
cooling
off
making
a
noise
like
the
boom
of
a
distant
gun
every
little
sound
being
magnified
by
the
utter
stillness
of
the
night
there
were
other
times
when
it
was
not
so
quiet
hundreds
of
birds
geese
ducks
and
had
been
seen
the
last
few
days
also
there
were
occasional
cranes
and
herons
over
a
thousand
miles
from
their
breeding
place
at
the
mouth
of
the
colorado
as
dusk
settled
we
would
see
these
birds
abandon
their
feeding
in
the
mud
and
line
up
on
the
shore
or
on
an
island
and
go
to
sleep
occasionally
one
of
these
birds
would
start
up
out
of
a
sound
sleep
with
an
unearthly
squawk
possibly
an
otter
had
interrupted
its
dreams
or
a
fox
had
pounced
on
one
as
it
slept
it
may
be
that
it
was
only
a
bad
dream
of
these
enemies
that
caused
their
fright
but
whatever
it
was
that
first
call
would
start
up
the
entire
flock
and
they
would
circle
in
confusion
like
a
stampeded
herd
of
cattle
their
discordant
cries
putting
an
end
to
the
stillness
of
the
night
finally
they
would
settle
down
in
a
new
spot
and
all
would
be
quiet
once
more
we
saw
a
few
birds
that
were
strangers
to
us
water
birds
which
we
imagined
belonged
to
the
salt
water
rather
than
the
inland
streams
making
a
little
excursion
perhaps
away
from
their
accustomed
haunts
one
type
we
saw
on
two
occasions
much
like
a
gull
but
smaller
pure
white
as
far
as
we
could
tell
soaring
in
graceful
flight
above
the
river
camp
no
was
close
to
the
beginning
of
a
new
canyon
the
country
had
been
changing
in
appearance
from
rather
flat
plains
to
small
bare
hills
gradually
increasing
in
height
with
smooth
rounded
sides
and
going
up
to
a
point
usually
of
a
dirty
clay
colour
with
little
vegetation
of
any
kind
on
them
the
river
for
miles
past
had
swept
in
long
graceful
curves
the
hills
being
close
to
the
river
on
the
outside
of
the
curve
leaving
a
big
flat
on
the
inside
this
flat
gradually
sloped
back
to
hills
of
an
equal
height
to
those
opposite
then
the
curve
would
reverse
and
the
same
conditions
would
be
met
with
again
but
on
opposite
sides
from
the
previous
bend
after
passing
a
creek
the
evening
before
the
hills
became
higher
and
from
our
camp
we
could
see
the
first
place
where
they
came
close
on
both
sides
to
the
river
we
felt
now
that
our
beautiful
canyons
were
behind
us
and
from
now
on
we
would
be
hemmed
in
by
the
great
eroded
canyons
of
the
southwest
we
were
sorry
to
leave
those
others
behind
and
could
easily
understand
why
major
powell
had
named
this
desolation
canyon
as
the
canyon
deepened
the
cliffs
were
cut
into
fantastic
shapes
as
is
usual
in
rocks
unprotected
by
vegetation
there
was
a
hard
rock
near
the
top
in
places
which
overhung
a
softer
formation
this
would
erode
giving
a
effect
to
the
cliffs
others
were
surmounted
by
square
towers
and
these
were
capped
by
a
border
of
little
squares
making
the
whole
look
much
like
a
castle
on
the
rhine
for
half
a
day
we
found
no
rapids
but
pulled
away
on
a
good
current
the
walls
gradually
grew
higher
and
were
more
rugged
a
few
trees
cropped
out
on
their
sides
at
noon
our
boats
were
lashed
together
and
lunch
was
eaten
as
we
drifted
we
covered
about
three
miles
in
this
way
taking
in
the
scenery
as
we
passed
we
saw
a
great
stone
arch
or
natural
bridge
high
on
a
stupendous
cliff
to
our
right
and
wondered
if
any
one
had
ever
climbed
up
to
it
our
lunch
was
no
more
than
finished
when
the
first
rapid
was
heard
ahead
of
us
quickly
unlashing
our
boats
we
prepared
for
strenuous
work
friday
the
proved
to
be
a
lucky
day
thirteen
large
rapids
and
thirteen
small
ones
were
placed
behind
us
before
we
camped
at
rock
creek
a
splashing
laughing
mountain
stream
no
doubt
containing
trout
the
following
morning
we
found
there
was
a
little
ranch
house
below
us
but
though
we
called
from
our
boats
no
one
came
out
we
wondered
how
any
one
could
reach
this
place
as
a
road
would
be
almost
an
impossibility
later
we
found
a
trail
on
the
side
all
the
way
through
the
canyon
we
saw
a
great
many
cattle
travelling
this
trail
some
were
drinking
at
the
river
when
we
swept
into
view
our
boats
filled
them
with
alarm
and
they
scrambled
for
the
hillsides
looking
after
us
with
frightened
expressions
as
we
left
them
to
the
rear
we
put
in
a
full
day
at
running
rapids
one
after
another
until
fifteen
large
ones
were
passed
no
count
being
kept
of
the
smaller
ones
some
of
these
rapids
resembled
dams
from
six
to
twelve
feet
high
with
the
water
falling
abruptly
over
a
steep
slope
others
were
long
and
rough
with
swift
water
in
places
above
one
of
these
we
had
landed
then
found
we
could
get
a
much
better
view
from
the
opposite
shore
emery
crossed
and
landed
i
followed
we
had
been
having
heavy
winds
all
day
when
crossing
here
i
was
caught
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
and
carried
to
the
head
of
the
rapid
i
heard
emery
call
look
out
for
the
big
rock
then
over
i
went
the
wind
and
water
together
had
turned
my
boat
sideways
and
try
as
i
would
i
could
not
get
it
turned
around
i
saw
the
rock
emery
referred
to
straight
ahead
of
me
it
was
about
fifteen
feet
square
and
about
fourteen
feet
from
the
shore
with
a
powerful
current
shooting
between
the
rock
and
the
shore
it
seemed
as
if
i
must
strike
the
rock
broadside
and
i
ceased
my
struggle
but
held
out
an
oar
with
both
hands
hoping
to
break
the
blow
but
it
never
came
the
water
struck
this
rock
with
great
force
then
rebounded
and
actually
kept
me
from
even
touching
the
rock
with
the
oar
but
it
caught
the
boat
and
shot
it
through
the
narrow
channel
bow
first
as
neatly
as
it
could
possibly
be
done
then
turned
the
boat
around
again
as
i
scrambled
to
regain
my
hold
on
both
oars
no
other
rocks
threatened
however
and
besides
filling
the
cockpit
with
water
no
damage
was
done
emery
had
no
desire
to
follow
my
passage
and
crossed
back
to
the
other
side
shooting
over
the
upper
end
of
the
rapid
his
boat
ran
up
on
a
rounded
rock
the
stern
sticking
high
in
the
air
it
paused
a
moment
the
current
slowly
turning
it
around
as
if
on
a
pivot
and
the
boat
slid
off
then
down
he
came
lurching
and
plunging
but
with
no
more
difficulty
many
times
in
such
places
as
these
we
saw
the
advantage
of
our
boats
over
one
with
a
keel
for
these
would
surely
be
upset
when
running
up
on
such
a
rock
chapter
x
hospitable
ranchmen
the
appearance
of
desolation
canyon
had
changed
entirely
in
the
lower
end
instead
of
a
straight
canyon
without
a
break
we
were
surrounded
by
mountain
peaks
nearly
feet
high
with
many
side
canyon
between
them
and
with
little
level
parks
at
the
end
of
the
canyons
beside
the
river
the
tops
were
cedars
clung
to
the
rocky
slopes
some
of
these
peaks
were
not
unlike
the
formations
of
the
grand
canyon
as
seen
from
the
inner
plateau
and
the
red
colouring
was
once
more
found
in
the
rocks
these
peaks
were
gradually
dropping
down
in
height
and
at
one
open
section
with
alfalfa
and
hay
fields
on
gently
sloping
hillsides
we
found
a
small
ranch
the
buildings
being
set
back
from
the
river
we
concluded
to
call
and
found
three
men
the
rancher
and
two
young
cowboys
at
work
in
a
blacksmith
shop
emery
had
forgotten
to
remove
his
and
the
men
looked
at
him
with
some
astonishment
as
he
was
still
soaking
wet
from
the
splashing
waves
of
the
last
rapid
when
i
joined
him
he
was
explaining
that
no
one
had
been
drowned
and
that
we
were
merely
making
an
excursion
down
the
river
mcpherson
the
rancher
we
learned
owned
all
the
cattle
seen
up
the
river
the
little
cabin
at
our
last
camp
was
a
sort
of
headquarters
for
his
cowboys
the
cattle
were
just
being
driven
from
the
mountains
before
the
snows
came
and
were
to
be
wintered
here
in
the
canyons
some
of
these
cattle
were
much
above
the
usual
grade
of
range
cattle
being
thoroughbreds
although
most
of
them
ran
loose
on
the
range
this
ranch
had
recently
lost
a
valuable
bull
which
had
been
killed
by
a
bear
up
in
the
mountains
not
unlike
similar
conflicts
in
more
civilized
sections
of
the
country
mcpherson
camped
on
this
trail
for
several
days
and
nights
before
he
finally
hung
his
pelt
on
a
tree
he
was
a
large
grizzly
four
other
bears
had
been
killed
this
same
year
in
these
mountains
mcpherson
home
had
burned
down
a
short
time
before
our
visit
and
his
family
had
removed
to
green
river
utah
a
number
of
tents
were
erected
neatly
boarded
up
and
we
were
informed
that
one
of
these
was
reserved
for
company
so
we
need
not
think
of
going
any
farther
that
day
these
men
while
absolutely
fearless
in
the
saddle
over
these
rough
mountain
trails
had
no
use
for
the
river
they
told
us
in
fact
we
found
this
was
the
usual
attitude
of
the
cattle
men
wherever
we
met
them
mcpherson
respect
for
the
river
was
not
without
reason
as
his
father
with
two
others
had
been
drowned
while
making
a
crossing
in
a
light
boat
near
this
point
some
years
before
some
accident
occurred
possibly
the
breaking
of
a
rowlock
and
they
were
carried
into
a
rapid
mcpherson
men
found
it
necessary
to
cross
their
cattle
back
and
forth
but
always
took
the
wise
precaution
to
have
on
some
the
cork
preservers
hung
in
the
blacksmith
shop
where
they
could
easily
be
reached
at
a
notice
desolation
canyon
with
a
slight
breaking
down
of
the
walls
for
a
short
distance
only
gave
place
to
gray
canyon
below
the
mcpherson
ranch
a
good
sized
mountain
stream
part
of
which
irrigated
the
ranch
above
found
its
way
through
this
division
we
had
been
told
that
more
rapids
lay
ahead
of
us
in
gray
canyon
but
they
were
not
so
numerous
in
our
next
day
travel
what
we
did
find
were
usually
large
but
we
ran
them
all
without
difficulty
about
noon
we
met
five
men
in
a
boat
rowing
up
the
stream
in
a
long
still
stretch
they
told
us
they
were
working
on
a
dam
a
mile
or
two
below
they
followed
us
down
to
see
us
make
the
passage
through
the
rapid
which
lay
above
their
camp
the
rapid
was
long
and
rocky
having
a
fall
in
a
half
mile
we
picked
our
channel
by
standing
up
in
the
boat
before
entering
the
rapid
and
were
soon
at
the
bottom
with
no
worse
mishap
than
bumping
a
rock
or
two
rather
lightly
we
had
bailed
out
and
were
tying
our
boats
when
the
men
came
panting
down
the
hill
up
which
they
had
climbed
to
see
us
make
this
plunge
a
number
of
men
were
at
work
here
but
this
being
sunday
most
of
them
had
gone
to
green
river
utah
miles
distant
among
the
little
crowd
who
came
down
to
see
us
resume
our
rowing
was
a
lady
and
a
little
girl
who
lived
in
a
rock
building
near
the
other
buildings
erected
for
the
emery
showed
the
child
a
picture
of
his
daughter
edith
with
her
mother
a
picture
he
always
carried
in
a
then
he
had
her
get
in
the
boat
with
him
and
we
made
a
photograph
of
them
they
were
very
good
friends
before
we
left
in
a
few
hours
we
emerged
from
the
canyon
into
a
level
country
a
large
butte
perhaps
feet
high
stood
out
by
itself
a
mile
from
the
main
cliffs
this
was
gunnison
butte
an
old
landmark
near
the
gunnison
trail
we
were
anxious
to
reach
blake
or
green
river
utah
not
many
miles
below
that
evening
but
we
failed
to
make
it
there
were
several
rapids
some
of
them
quite
large
and
we
had
run
them
all
when
we
came
to
a
low
dam
that
obstructed
our
passage
while
looking
it
over
seeing
how
best
to
make
a
portage
a
young
man
whom
we
had
just
seen
remarked
well
boys
you
had
better
tie
up
and
i
will
help
you
in
the
morning
it
was
then
and
we
were
still
six
miles
from
green
river
so
we
took
his
advice
and
camped
on
seeing
our
sleeping
bags
tightly
strapped
and
making
rather
small
roll
he
remarked
well
you
fellows
are
not
mormons
i
can
tell
by
the
size
of
your
beds
our
new
friend
gave
the
name
of
wolverton
there
was
another
man
named
wilson
who
owned
a
ranch
just
below
the
dam
both
of
these
men
were
much
interested
in
our
experiences
wolverton
had
considerable
knowledge
of
the
river
and
of
boats
very
little
persuasion
would
have
been
necessary
to
have
had
him
for
a
companion
on
the
balance
of
our
journey
but
we
had
made
up
our
minds
to
make
it
alone
now
as
it
looked
feasible
both
wilson
and
wolverton
knew
the
country
below
green
river
utah
having
made
surveys
through
much
of
the
surrounding
territory
wolverton
said
we
must
surely
see
his
father
who
lived
down
the
river
and
who
was
an
enthusiast
on
motor
boats
a
few
minutes
work
the
next
morning
sufficed
to
get
our
boats
over
the
dam
the
dam
was
constructed
of
loose
rock
and
piles
chinked
with
brush
and
covered
with
sloping
planks
just
a
small
dam
to
raise
the
water
for
irrigation
purposes
much
of
the
water
ran
through
the
canal
in
places
the
planks
were
dry
in
others
some
water
ran
over
the
boats
being
unloaded
were
pulled
up
on
these
planks
then
slid
into
the
water
below
wilson
had
a
large
water
wheel
for
irrigation
purposes
the
first
of
several
such
wheels
which
we
were
to
see
this
day
these
wheels
twenty
feet
or
more
in
height
with
slender
metal
buckets
each
holding
gallons
of
water
fastened
at
intervals
on
either
side
were
placed
in
a
swift
current
anchored
on
the
shore
to
stout
piles
or
erected
over
cut
in
the
banks
there
they
revolved
the
buckets
filling
and
emptying
automatically
the
water
running
off
in
troughs
above
the
level
of
the
river
back
to
the
fertile
soil
some
of
these
wheels
had
ingenious
floating
arrangements
whereby
they
accommodated
themselves
to
the
different
stages
of
a
rising
or
falling
river
we
took
a
few
pictures
of
wilson
place
before
leaving
he
informed
us
that
he
had
telephoned
to
certain
people
in
green
river
who
would
help
us
in
various
ways
two
rowing
past
many
pretty
little
ranches
brought
us
to
the
railroad
bridge
a
grateful
sight
to
us
a
pumping
plant
stood
beside
the
bridge
under
charge
of
captain
yokey
one
of
wilson
friends
yokey
owned
a
large
motor
boat
which
was
tied
up
to
the
shore
our
boats
were
left
in
his
charge
while
we
went
up
to
the
town
a
mile
distant
another
of
wilson
friends
met
us
and
secured
a
dark
room
for
us
so
that
we
could
do
a
little
developing
and
we
prepared
for
work
on
the
following
day
that
night
a
newspaper
reporter
hunted
us
out
anxious
for
a
story
we
gave
him
what
we
had
making
light
of
our
previous
difficulties
which
were
exciting
enough
at
times
but
owing
to
the
comparatively
small
size
of
the
stream
we
seldom
thought
our
lives
were
in
any
great
danger
the
papers
made
the
most
of
these
things
and
the
stories
that
came
out
had
little
semblance
to
our
original
statements
we
have
since
learned
that
no
matter
how
much
one
minimizes
such
things
they
are
seldom
published
as
reported
we
put
in
a
busy
day
unpacking
new
films
and
plates
developing
all
films
from
the
smaller
cameras
and
sending
these
home
a
new
stock
of
provisions
had
to
be
purchased
enough
for
one
month
at
least
for
there
was
no
chance
of
securing
supplies
until
we
reached
our
canyon
home
about
miles
below
we
had
a
valuable
addition
to
our
cargo
in
two
metal
boxes
that
had
been
shipped
here
as
it
was
not
possible
to
get
them
before
leaving
wyoming
these
cases
or
trunks
were
sent
from
england
and
were
if
not
waterproof
there
being
a
slight
difference
well
constructed
with
rubber
gaskets
and
heavy
clamps
every
possible
precaution
had
been
taken
it
seemed
to
exclude
the
water
and
still
render
them
easy
of
access
they
were
about
thirty
inches
long
fifteen
wide
and
twelve
high
just
the
thing
for
our
photographic
material
up
to
this
time
everything
had
to
be
kept
under
the
deck
when
in
bad
water
these
boxes
were
placed
in
the
open
section
in
front
of
us
and
were
thoroughly
fastened
to
the
ribs
to
prevent
loss
ready
to
be
opened
or
closed
in
a
moment
quite
a
convenience
when
pictures
had
to
be
taken
hurriedly
the
following
day
we
went
over
the
boats
caulking
few
leaks
the
bottoms
of
the
boats
were
considerably
the
worse
for
wear
owing
to
our
difficulties
in
the
first
canyons
we
got
some
thin
oak
strips
and
nailed
them
on
the
bottom
to
help
protect
them
when
portaging
sliding
the
boats
on
the
scouring
sand
and
rock
was
hard
on
the
boards
on
the
bottom
of
the
boats
this
work
was
all
completed
that
day
and
everything
was
ready
for
the
next
plunge
in
passing
the
station
we
noticed
the
elevation
above
was
placed
at
feet
and
remembered
that
green
river
wyoming
was
feet
showing
that
our
descent
in
the
past
miles
had
been
close
to
feet
we
had
not
found
it
necessary
to
line
or
portage
any
rapids
since
leaving
lodore
canyon
we
were
hopeful
that
our
good
luck
would
continue
nothing
was
to
be
feared
from
what
remained
of
the
green
river
miles
or
more
for
motor
boats
made
the
journey
to
its
junction
with
the
grand
and
we
were
told
even
ascended
the
grand
for
some
distance
below
this
junction
was
the
colorado
river
a
different
stream
from
the
one
we
were
still
to
navigate
before
leaving
we
ate
a
final
hearty
breakfast
at
the
where
we
had
been
taking
our
meals
a
number
of
young
men
clerks
in
some
of
the
business
houses
here
were
among
the
boarders
the
landlady
a
german
woman
and
an
excellent
cook
was
greatly
worried
over
their
small
appetites
thinking
it
was
a
reflection
on
her
table
she
remarked
that
she
hoped
we
had
good
appetites
and
i
am
sure
she
had
no
complaint
to
make
so
far
as
we
were
concerned
we
had
never
stinted
ourselves
when
on
the
river
but
the
change
and
the
rest
seemed
to
give
us
an
abnormal
appetite
that
could
not
be
satisfied
and
we
would
simply
quit
eating
because
we
were
ashamed
to
eat
more
less
than
half
an
hour
after
one
of
these
big
meals
i
was
surprised
to
see
my
brother
in
a
restaurant
with
a
sheepish
grin
on
his
face
and
with
a
lunch
before
him
chapter
xi
wonders
of
erosion
october
the
we
embarked
again
with
two
of
our
friends
on
board
as
passengers
for
a
short
ride
their
intention
being
to
hunt
as
they
walked
back
they
left
us
at
a
ranch
beside
the
san
rafael
river
a
small
stream
entering
from
the
west
they
left
some
mail
with
us
to
be
delivered
to
wolverton
whose
son
we
had
met
above
about
miles
below
green
river
we
reached
his
home
judging
by
a
number
of
boats
both
motor
and
row
boats
tied
to
his
landing
wolverton
was
an
enthusiastic
after
glancing
over
his
mail
he
asked
how
we
had
come
and
was
interested
when
he
learned
that
we
were
making
a
boating
trip
he
was
decidedly
interested
when
he
saw
the
boats
and
learned
that
we
were
going
to
our
home
in
the
grand
canyon
his
first
impression
was
that
we
were
merely
making
a
little
pleasure
trip
on
the
quiet
water
going
carefully
over
the
boats
he
remarked
that
they
met
with
his
approval
with
one
exception
they
seemed
to
be
a
little
bit
short
for
the
heavy
rapids
of
the
colorado
he
thought
he
agreed
that
our
experience
in
the
upper
rapids
had
been
good
training
but
said
there
was
no
comparison
in
the
rapids
we
would
have
a
river
ten
times
as
great
as
in
lodore
to
contend
with
and
in
numerous
places
for
short
distances
the
descent
was
as
abrupt
as
anything
we
had
seen
on
the
green
wolverton
was
personally
acquainted
with
a
number
of
the
men
who
had
made
the
river
trip
and
with
the
one
exception
of
major
powell
expeditions
had
met
all
the
parties
who
had
successfully
navigated
its
waters
this
not
only
included
galloway
and
respective
expeditions
which
had
made
the
entire
trip
but
included
two
other
expeditions
which
began
at
green
river
utah
and
had
gone
through
the
canyons
of
the
colorado
these
were
the
expedition
which
made
a
railroad
survey
through
the
canyons
of
the
colorado
and
another
commonly
known
as
the
expedition
two
of
the
party
making
the
complete
trip
arriving
at
needles
after
a
voyage
filled
with
adventure
and
many
narrow
escapes
wolverton
remarked
that
every
one
knew
of
those
who
had
navigated
the
entire
series
of
canyons
but
that
few
people
knew
of
those
who
had
been
unsuccessful
he
knew
of
seven
parties
that
had
failed
to
get
through
cataract
canyon
miles
of
rapids
with
their
boats
most
of
them
never
being
heard
of
again
these
unsuccessful
parties
were
often
miners
or
prospectors
who
wished
to
get
into
the
comparatively
flat
country
which
began
about
fifty
miles
below
the
junction
of
the
green
and
the
grand
rivers
here
lay
glen
canyon
with
miles
of
quiet
water
nothing
need
be
feared
in
this
or
in
the
miles
of
good
boating
from
green
river
utah
to
the
junction
between
these
two
points
however
lay
cataract
canyon
beginning
at
the
junction
of
the
two
rivers
judging
by
its
unsavory
record
cataract
canyon
was
something
to
be
feared
among
these
parties
who
had
made
short
trips
on
the
river
was
one
composed
of
two
men
phil
foote
was
a
gambler
stage
robber
and
bad
man
in
general
he
had
broken
out
of
jail
in
salt
lake
city
and
accompanied
by
another
of
similar
character
stole
a
boat
at
green
river
utah
and
proceeded
down
the
river
soon
after
entering
cataract
canyon
they
lost
their
boat
and
provisions
finding
a
tent
which
had
been
washed
down
the
river
they
tore
it
into
strips
and
constructed
a
raft
out
driftwood
tying
the
logs
together
with
the
strips
of
canvas
days
of
hardship
followed
and
starvation
stared
them
in
the
face
until
finally
foote
partner
gave
up
said
he
would
drown
himself
with
an
oath
foote
drew
his
revolver
saying
he
had
enough
of
such
cowardice
and
would
save
him
the
trouble
his
companion
then
begged
for
his
life
saying
he
would
stick
to
the
end
and
they
finally
got
through
to
the
hite
ranch
which
lay
a
short
distance
below
they
were
taken
care
of
here
and
terminated
their
voyage
a
short
distance
beyond
going
out
over
land
foote
was
afterwards
shot
and
killed
while
holding
up
a
stage
in
nevada
the
hite
ranch
also
proved
to
be
a
place
of
refuge
for
others
the
sole
survivors
of
two
other
parties
who
were
wrecked
one
person
escaping
on
each
occasion
hite
ranch
and
lee
ferry
miles
below
hite
had
mail
service
we
had
left
instructions
at
the
to
forward
our
mail
to
one
or
the
other
of
these
points
these
were
also
the
only
places
on
our
run
to
bright
angel
trail
where
we
could
expect
to
see
any
people
so
we
were
informed
we
were
about
to
descend
into
what
is
possibly
the
least
inhabited
portion
of
the
united
states
of
america
a
party
of
civil
engineers
working
here
joined
us
that
evening
at
wolverton
home
a
young
man
in
the
party
asked
us
if
we
would
consent
to
carry
a
letter
through
with
us
and
mail
it
at
our
destination
he
thought
it
would
be
an
interesting
souvenir
for
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
we
agreed
to
do
our
best
but
would
not
guarantee
delivery
the
next
morning
two
letters
were
given
us
to
mail
and
were
accepted
with
this
one
reservation
before
leaving
wolverton
showed
us
his
motor
boat
with
much
pardonable
pride
on
this
boat
he
sometimes
took
small
parties
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
colorado
river
and
up
the
grand
a
round
trip
of
three
hundred
miles
or
more
the
boat
had
never
been
taken
down
the
colorado
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
rapids
began
almost
immediately
below
the
junction
wolverton
while
he
had
never
been
through
the
rapids
in
a
boat
had
followed
the
river
on
foot
for
several
miles
and
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
their
nature
on
parting
he
remarked
well
boys
you
are
going
to
tackle
a
mighty
hard
proposition
but
i
sure
you
can
make
it
if
you
are
only
careful
but
look
out
and
go
easy
wolverton
was
no
novice
speaking
from
much
experience
in
bad
water
and
we
were
greatly
impressed
by
what
he
had
to
say
five
uneventful
days
were
spent
in
labyrinth
and
stillwater
canyons
through
which
the
green
peacefully
completed
its
rather
violent
descent
in
the
upper
end
we
usually
found
rough
water
in
the
canyons
and
quiet
water
in
the
open
sections
here
at
least
were
two
canyons
varying
from
feet
at
their
beginning
to
in
depth
both
without
a
rapid
the
first
of
these
was
labyrinth
canyon
so
named
from
its
elaborately
winding
course
as
well
as
its
wonderful
intricate
system
of
dry
lateral
canyons
and
its
reproduction
in
rock
of
architectural
forms
castles
arches
and
grottos
even
animals
and
people
were
represented
in
every
varying
form
our
sunday
camp
was
beside
what
might
be
called
a
serpentine
curve
or
series
of
loops
in
the
river
this
was
at
the
centre
of
what
is
known
as
the
double
bow
knot
three
rounded
loops
very
symmetrical
in
form
with
an
almost
circular
formation
of
rock
a
mile
or
more
in
diameter
in
the
centre
of
each
loop
a
narrow
neck
of
rock
connects
these
formations
to
the
main
mesa
all
being
on
the
same
level
about
feet
above
the
river
the
upper
half
of
the
rock
walls
was
sheer
below
was
a
steep
slope
the
centre
formation
is
the
largest
and
most
perfect
being
nearly
two
miles
in
diameter
and
almost
round
so
much
so
that
a
very
few
minutes
are
necessary
to
climb
over
the
narrow
neck
which
connects
this
formation
to
the
mesa
it
took
minutes
of
hard
rowing
on
a
good
current
to
take
us
around
this
one
loop
the
neck
is
being
rapidly
eroded
two
hundred
feet
having
disappeared
from
the
top
and
at
some
distant
day
will
doubtless
disappear
entirely
making
a
short
cut
for
the
river
and
will
leave
a
rounded
island
of
rock
standing
seven
hundred
feet
above
the
river
a
view
of
the
three
loops
would
compare
well
in
shape
to
the
little
mechanical
contrivance
known
as
the
eye
in
the
combination
of
hook
and
eye
all
women
and
many
men
will
get
a
clear
idea
the
shape
of
the
double
bow
knot
from
this
comparison
we
recorded
an
interesting
experiment
with
the
thermometer
at
this
camp
showing
a
great
variety
of
temperatures
unbelievable
almost
to
one
who
knows
nothing
of
conditions
in
these
plateaus
a
little
ice
had
formed
the
night
before
under
a
clear
sky
the
next
day
at
noon
our
thermometer
recorded
degrees
in
the
shade
but
ran
up
to
degrees
in
the
sun
at
the
same
time
the
water
in
the
river
was
degrees
far
the
effect
of
being
deluged
in
waves
then
running
into
deep
sunless
canyons
with
a
cold
wind
sweeping
down
from
the
snow
on
top
can
be
easier
imagined
than
described
this
is
what
we
could
expect
to
meet
later
the
colouring
of
the
rocks
varied
greatly
in
many
localities
a
light
red
predominating
in
some
places
the
red
rock
was
capped
by
a
gray
limestone
in
others
this
had
disappeared
but
underneath
the
red
were
regular
strata
of
rocks
pink
brown
light
yellow
even
blue
and
green
being
found
in
two
or
three
sections
the
forms
of
erosion
were
as
varied
as
the
rock
itself
each
rock
stratum
presenting
a
different
surface
in
one
place
the
surface
was
broken
into
rounded
forms
like
the
backs
of
a
herd
of
elephants
in
others
we
saw
reproductions
of
images
carved
by
the
drifting
sands
a
diana
with
uplifted
arm
as
large
as
the
goddess
of
liberty
a
billiken
on
a
throne
with
a
hundred
worshippers
bowed
around
covered
with
ruins
and
magnificent
rock
structures
as
this
section
is
it
is
not
entirely
without
utility
it
is
a
grazing
country
great
numbers
of
contented
cattle
with
red
and
white
or
black
and
white
patches
of
colour
on
their
hides
were
found
in
the
open
spaces
between
the
cliffs
dusty
trails
led
down
through
these
wide
canyons
trails
which
undoubtedly
gained
the
top
of
the
level
rocky
plateau
a
few
miles
back
from
the
river
as
is
usual
in
a
cattle
country
at
the
end
of
the
summer
season
the
close
to
the
water
supply
which
in
this
case
happened
to
the
river
was
nibbled
close
to
the
roots
the
cattle
only
came
here
to
drink
then
travelled
many
miles
no
doubt
to
the
better
grazing
on
the
upper
plateaus
the
sage
always
gray
was
grayer
still
with
dust
raised
by
many
passing
herds
there
was
a
band
of
range
horses
too
those
splendid
animals
with
kingly
bearing
and
tails
and
manes
lean
like
a
and
pawing
and
neighing
half
defiant
and
half
afraid
of
the
sight
of
men
the
only
thing
alive
to
which
they
pay
tribute
it
is
a
never
ending
source
of
wonder
to
those
unacquainted
with
the
country
how
these
animals
can
exist
in
a
land
which
to
them
seems
utterly
destitute
and
barren
to
many
such
a
meadow
carpeted
with
blue
grass
or
timothy
is
the
only
pasture
on
which
grazing
horses
or
grazing
cattle
can
exist
the
looking
tufts
of
scattered
here
and
there
or
sheltered
at
the
roots
of
the
sage
mean
nothing
the
hidden
in
the
is
unnoticed
or
mistaken
for
a
weed
but
if
the
land
was
bare
of
verdure
the
rock
saved
it
from
being
monotonous
varied
in
colour
the
red
rock
predominated
at
at
sunset
with
purple
shadows
and
with
the
delicate
blue
outlines
always
found
in
the
western
distances
such
a
land
could
never
be
called
uninteresting
the
banks
of
the
stream
here
in
the
open
were
always
green
from
an
elevation
they
appeared
like
two
emerald
bands
through
a
land
of
red
bordering
a
stream
the
tint
of
the
aged
pottery
found
along
its
shores
we
were
continually
finding
new
trees
and
strange
shrubs
beside
the
cottonwoods
and
the
willows
there
was
an
occasional
tree
in
the
shrubs
were
the
and
the
with
sticky
fruit
the
cacti
were
small
and
excepting
the
prickly
pear
were
confined
nearly
altogether
to
a
small
cactus
growing
a
little
larger
as
we
travelled
south
and
always
in
the
mornings
when
out
of
the
deep
canyons
the
moist
pungent
odour
of
the
sage
greeted
our
nostrils
it
is
inseparable
from
the
west
there
is
no
stuffy
air
there
out
in
the
sage
one
is
glad
to
live
simply
to
breathe
it
in
and
exhale
and
breathe
again
in
stillwater
canyon
the
walls
ran
up
to
feet
in
height
a
narrow
canyon
with
precipitous
sides
occasionally
we
could
see
great
columns
of
rock
standing
on
top
of
the
mesa
late
one
evening
we
saw
some
small
cliff
dwellings
several
hundred
feet
above
the
river
and
a
few
crude
ladders
leaning
against
the
cliff
below
the
dwellings
a
suitable
camp
could
not
be
made
here
or
we
would
have
stopped
to
examine
them
the
shores
were
slippery
with
mud
and
quicksands
and
there
was
no
in
sight
from
here
to
the
end
of
the
canyons
we
would
have
to
depend
almost
entirely
on
the
for
a
landing
was
finally
made
where
a
section
of
a
cliff
had
toppled
from
above
affording
a
solid
footing
leading
up
to
the
higher
bank
we
judged
from
our
maps
that
we
were
within
a
very
few
miles
of
the
colorado
river
here
some
footprints
and
signs
of
an
old
boat
landing
apparently
about
a
week
old
were
seen
in
the
sand
this
surprised
us
somewhat
as
we
had
heard
of
no
one
coming
down
ahead
of
us
chapter
xii
could
we
succeed
an
hour
or
two
at
the
oars
the
next
morning
sufficed
to
bring
us
to
the
junction
of
the
green
and
the
grand
rivers
we
tied
up
our
boats
and
prepared
to
climb
out
on
top
as
we
had
a
desire
to
see
the
view
from
above
a
mile
back
on
the
green
we
had
noticed
a
sort
of
canyon
or
slope
breaking
down
on
the
west
side
affording
a
chance
to
reach
the
top
loading
ourselves
with
a
light
lunch
a
full
canteen
and
our
smaller
cameras
we
returned
to
this
point
and
proceeded
to
climb
out
powell
second
expedition
had
climbed
out
at
this
same
place
wolverton
had
also
mentioned
the
fact
that
he
had
been
out
so
we
were
quite
sure
of
a
successful
attempt
before
we
made
the
climb
the
walk
close
to
the
river
over
rocks
and
along
narrow
ledges
was
hard
work
the
climb
out
was
even
more
so
the
contour
maps
which
we
carried
credited
these
walls
with
feet
height
if
we
had
any
doubt
concerning
the
accuracy
of
this
it
disappeared
before
we
finally
reached
the
top
what
we
saw
however
was
worth
all
the
discomfort
we
had
undergone
close
the
top
three
branches
of
dry
gullies
carved
from
a
gritty
homogeneous
sandstone
spread
out
from
the
slope
we
had
been
climbing
these
were
less
precipitous
taking
the
extreme
gully
we
found
the
climb
to
the
top
much
easier
at
the
very
end
we
found
an
irregular
hole
a
few
feet
in
diameter
not
a
cave
but
an
opening
left
between
some
immense
rocks
touching
at
the
top
seemingly
rolled
together
gazing
down
through
this
opening
we
were
amazed
to
find
that
we
were
directly
above
the
colorado
itself
it
was
so
confusing
at
first
that
we
had
to
climb
to
the
very
top
to
see
which
river
it
was
i
contending
that
it
was
the
green
until
satisfied
that
i
was
mistaken
the
view
from
the
top
was
overwhelming
and
words
can
hardly
describe
what
we
saw
or
how
we
were
affected
by
it
we
found
ourselves
on
top
of
an
irregular
plateau
of
solid
rock
with
no
earth
or
vegetation
save
a
few
little
bushes
and
some
very
small
cedars
in
cracks
in
the
rocks
branching
canyons
three
or
four
hundred
feet
in
depth
and
great
fissures
ran
down
in
this
rock
at
intervals
some
were
dark
and
crooked
and
the
bottom
could
not
be
seen
between
these
cracks
the
rock
rounded
like
elephants
backs
sloping
steeply
on
either
side
some
could
be
crossed
some
could
not
others
resembled
a
maze
the
puzzle
being
how
to
get
from
one
point
to
another
a
few
away
the
rock
was
a
sandstone
and
presented
a
rough
surface
affording
a
good
hold
so
there
was
little
danger
of
slipping
we
usually
sat
down
and
inched
way
to
the
edge
of
the
cracks
jumping
across
to
little
ledges
when
possible
always
helping
each
other
the
rock
at
the
very
edge
of
the
main
canyon
overhung
in
places
to
feet
and
the
great
mass
of
gigantic
boulders
sections
of
shattered
cliffs
on
the
steep
slope
near
the
river
gave
evidence
of
a
continual
breaking
away
of
these
immense
rocks
to
the
north
across
the
canyon
up
which
we
had
climbed
were
a
great
number
of
smooth
formations
from
one
hundred
to
four
hundred
feet
high
rounded
on
top
in
domes
reminding
one
of
bagdad
and
tales
from
the
arabian
nights
the
land
of
standing
rocks
the
utes
call
it
the
rock
on
which
we
stood
was
light
gray
or
nearly
white
the
river
walls
at
the
base
for
a
thousand
feet
above
the
river
were
dark
red
or
while
the
tops
of
the
formations
above
this
level
were
a
beautiful
light
red
tint
but
there
were
other
wonders
on
the
south
side
of
the
gorge
miles
away
were
great
spires
pointing
heavenward
singly
and
in
groups
looking
like
a
city
of
churches
beyond
the
spires
were
the
blue
mountains
to
the
east
the
hazy
lasalle
range
and
nearest
of
all
on
the
west
just
north
of
the
colorado
lay
the
peaks
of
the
henry
mountains
directly
below
us
was
the
colorado
river
muddy
swirllng
and
forbidding
a
mile
away
boomed
a
rapid
beyond
that
was
another
then
the
river
was
lost
to
view
standing
on
the
brink
of
all
this
desolation
it
is
small
wonder
if
we
recalled
the
accounts
of
the
disasters
which
had
overtaken
so
many
others
in
the
canyon
below
us
many
who
had
escaped
the
water
had
climbed
out
on
to
this
death
trap
as
it
had
proven
to
be
for
them
some
to
perish
of
thirst
and
starvation
a
few
to
stagger
into
the
ranch
below
the
canyon
a
week
or
more
after
they
had
escaped
from
the
water
small
wonder
that
some
of
these
had
lost
their
reason
we
could
only
conjecture
at
the
fate
of
the
party
whose
wrecked
boat
had
been
found
by
the
stone
expedition
a
few
miles
below
this
place
with
their
tracks
still
fresh
in
the
sand
no
trace
of
them
was
ever
found
for
the
first
time
it
began
to
dawn
on
us
that
we
might
have
tackled
a
job
beyond
our
power
to
complete
most
of
the
parties
which
had
safely
completed
the
trip
were
composed
of
several
men
adding
much
to
the
safety
of
the
expedition
as
a
whole
others
had
boats
much
lighter
than
ours
a
great
help
in
many
respects
speaking
for
myself
i
was
just
a
little
and
not
a
little
overawed
as
we
prepared
to
return
to
the
boats
while
returning
we
saw
evidences
of
ancient
indians
some
broken
and
pottery
also
and
a
small
cliff
ruin
under
a
shelving
rock
what
could
an
indian
find
here
to
interest
him
we
had
found
neither
bird
nor
rabbit
not
even
a
lizard
in
the
land
of
standing
rocks
perhaps
they
were
sun
worshippers
and
wanted
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
eastern
sky
that
at
least
could
be
had
in
unrivalled
grandeur
here
above
the
rio
colorado
the
shadows
were
beginning
to
lengthen
when
we
finally
reached
our
boats
at
the
junction
camp
was
made
under
a
large
weeping
willow
tree
the
only
tree
of
its
kind
we
remembered
having
seen
on
the
journey
while
emery
prepared
a
hasty
meal
i
made
a
few
arrangements
for
embarking
on
the
colorado
river
the
next
morning
we
were
prepared
to
bid
farewell
to
the
green
river
the
stream
that
had
served
us
so
well
in
spite
of
our
trials
even
in
the
upper
canyons
we
had
found
much
enjoyment
in
our
passage
through
its
strange
and
beautiful
surroundings
from
a
scenic
point
of
view
the
canyons
of
the
green
river
with
their
wonderful
rock
formations
and
stupendous
gorges
are
second
only
to
those
of
the
colorado
itself
it
is
strange
they
are
so
little
known
when
one
considers
the
comparative
ease
with
which
these
canyons
on
the
lower
end
can
be
reached
some
day
perhaps
surfeited
after
having
tired
of
commonplace
scenery
and
foreign
lands
will
learn
what
a
wonderful
region
this
is
here
on
the
lower
end
of
the
green
river
then
no
doubt
wolverton
or
others
with
similar
outfits
will
find
a
steady
stream
of
anxious
to
take
the
motor
boat
ride
down
to
this
point
and
up
to
moab
utah
a
little
mormon
town
on
the
grand
river
a
short
ride
by
automobile
from
moab
to
the
railway
would
complete
a
most
wonderful
journey
then
the
transcontinental
journey
could
be
resumed
so
i
mused
as
i
contrived
an
arrangement
of
iron
hooks
and
oak
sticks
to
hold
on
a
hatch
cover
from
which
all
the
thumb
screws
had
been
lost
more
than
likely
my
dream
of
a
line
of
motor
boats
will
be
long
deferred
or
they
may
even
meet
the
fate
of
brown
and
stanton
plans
for
a
railroad
down
these
gorges
as
a
reminder
of
the
fate
which
overtakes
so
many
of
our
feeble
plans
we
found
a
record
of
stanton
survey
on
a
fallen
boulder
an
inscription
reading
a
sta
the
abbreviations
standing
for
denver
colorado
canyons
and
pacific
railroad
it
is
possible
that
the
hands
that
chiselled
the
inscription
belonged
to
one
of
the
three
men
who
were
afterwards
drowned
in
marble
canyon
emery
being
very
practical
interrupted
my
revery
and
plans
for
future
by
announcing
supper
the
meal
was
limited
in
variety
but
generous
in
quantity
and
consisted
of
a
stew
fried
potatoes
and
cocoa
a
satisfied
interior
soon
dispelled
all
our
previous
apprehensiveness
we
decided
not
to
run
our
rapids
before
we
came
to
them
the
water
still
gave
indications
of
being
higher
than
mark
although
it
was
falling
fast
on
the
green
river
each
morning
for
three
days
previous
to
our
arrival
at
the
junction
we
would
find
the
water
about
six
inches
lower
than
the
stage
of
the
evening
before
strange
to
say
we
gained
on
the
water
with
each
day
rowing
until
we
had
almost
overtaken
the
stage
of
water
we
had
lost
during
the
night
more
than
likely
we
would
have
all
the
water
we
needed
under
the
new
conditions
which
were
before
us
beginning
with
the
colorado
river
we
made
our
journals
much
more
complete
in
some
ways
giving
all
the
large
rapids
a
number
and
describing
many
of
them
in
detail
this
was
done
not
only
for
our
own
satisfaction
but
for
the
purpose
of
comparison
with
others
who
had
gone
through
for
many
of
these
rapids
have
histories
it
was
often
a
question
when
on
the
green
river
where
to
draw
the
line
when
counting
a
rapid
this
was
less
difficult
when
on
the
colorado
while
the
descent
was
about
the
same
as
in
some
of
the
rapids
above
the
increased
volume
of
water
made
them
look
and
act
decidedly
different
we
drew
the
line
when
counting
a
rapid
at
a
descent
having
a
decided
agitation
of
the
water
hidden
rocks
or
swift
descent
and
with
an
eddy
or
whirlpool
below
major
powell
considered
that
many
of
these
drops
in
the
next
canyon
were
above
the
ordinary
rapid

the

a
companion
voyager
thursday
morning
october
the
found
emery
feeling
very
poorly
but
insisting
on
going
ahead
with
our
day
work
so
camp
no
was
soon
behind
us
we
were
embarked
on
a
new
stream
flowing
with
a
body
of
water
ten
times
the
size
of
that
which
we
had
found
in
the
upper
canyons
of
the
green
our
boats
looked
quite
small
when
compared
with
the
united
currents
of
the
green
and
the
grand
rivers
the
colorado
river
must
have
been
about
feet
wide
here
just
below
the
junction
with
a
current
and
possibly
feet
deep
although
this
is
only
a
guess
the
grand
river
appeared
to
be
the
higher
of
the
two
streams
and
had
a
decidedly
red
colour
as
though
a
recent
storm
was
being
carried
down
its
gorges
while
the
colour
of
the
green
was
more
of
a
coffee
colour
coffee
with
a
little
cream
in
it
a
fourth
of
a
mile
below
the
junction
the
two
currents
began
to
mix
with
a
great
ado
about
it
with
small
whirlpools
and
swift
eddies
and
sudden
outbursts
from
beneath
as
though
a
strangled
current
was
struggling
to
escape
from
the
weight
which
overpowered
it
the
boats
were
twisted
this
way
and
that
and
hard
rowing
was
necessary
to
carry
us
down
to
the
steadied
current
and
to
the
first
rapid
which
we
could
hear
when
yet
far
above
it
soon
we
were
running
rapids
again
and
getting
a
lot
of
sport
out
of
it
there
were
some
rocks
but
there
was
water
enough
so
that
these
could
be
avoided
if
one
channel
did
not
suit
us
we
took
another
and
although
we
were
drenched
in
every
rapid
and
the
cockpit
was
half
filled
each
time
it
was
not
cold
enough
to
cause
us
any
great
discomfort
and
we
bailed
out
at
the
end
of
each
rapid
then
hurried
on
to
tackle
the
next
each
of
these
rapids
was
from
a
fourth
to
a
third
of
a
mile
in
length
the
average
was
at
least
one
big
rapid
to
the
mile
when
no
was
reached
we
paused
a
little
longer
and
looked
it
over
more
carefully
than
we
had
the
others
it
had
a
short
quick
descent
then
a
long
line
of
waves
with
a
big
whirlpool
on
the
right
there
were
numerous
rocks
which
would
take
careful
work
to
avoid
the
waves
were
big
big
enough
for
a
motion
picture
so
emery
remained
on
shore
with
both
the
camera
and
the
plate
camera
in
position
ready
to
take
the
picture
while
i
ran
my
boat
at
the
head
of
this
rapid
we
saw
footprints
in
the
sand
but
not
made
with
the
same
shoe
as
that
which
we
had
noticed
above
the
junction
we
had
also
seen
signs
of
a
camp
and
some
fishes
heads
above
this
point
and
what
we
took
to
be
a
dog
track
along
the
shore
at
the
head
of
the
next
rapid
we
saw
them
again
but
on
opposite
side
of
the
river
and
could
see
where
boat
had
been
pulled
up
on
the
sand
this
next
rapid
was
almost
as
bad
as
the
one
above
it
but
with
a
longer
descent
instead
of
one
abrupt
drop
the
following
rapid
was
so
close
that
we
continued
along
the
shore
to
look
it
over
at
the
same
time
saving
a
stop
between
the
two
rapids
the
shores
were
strewn
with
a
litter
of
gigantic
boulders
fallen
sections
of
the
overhanging
cliffs
we
found
more
of
this
in
cataract
canyon
than
in
any
of
the
canyons
above
this
was
partly
responsible
for
the
violence
of
the
rapids
although
the
descent
of
the
river
would
make
rough
water
even
if
there
were
no
boulders
working
back
along
the
shore
we
were
suddenly
electrified
into
quick
action
by
seeing
the
come
floating
down
the
river
close
to
the
shore
and
almost
on
the
rapid
emery
was
a
short
distance
ahead
and
ran
for
the
i
caught
up
a
long
pole
and
got
on
a
projecting
rock
hoping
i
might
steer
her
in
she
passed
me
and
was
soon
in
the
midst
of
the
rapid
before
emery
had
launched
the
boat
three
gigantic
boulders
extended
above
the
water
about
fifty
feet
from
shore
with
a
very
crooked
channel
between
down
toward
these
boulders
came
the
plunging
like
a
thing
possessed
how
it
was
done
i
could
never
tell
but
she
passed
through
the
crooked
channel
without
once
touching
and
continued
over
the
rapid
meanwhile
emery
had
run
the
other
side
and
had
gained
on
the
but
only
caught
her
when
close
to
the
next
rapid
so
he
turned
her
loose
and
came
to
the
shore
for
me
emery
had
not
been
feeling
his
best
and
i
advised
him
to
remain
on
shore
while
i
took
the
boat
as
we
made
the
change
we
again
observed
the
boat
bounding
through
the
next
rapid
whirling
on
the
tops
of
the
waves
as
though
in
the
hands
of
a
superhuman
juggler
i
managed
to
overtake
her
in
a
whirlpool
below
the
rapid
and
came
to
shore
for
her
captain
he
was
nearly
exhausted
with
his
efforts
still
he
insisted
on
continuing
a
few
miles
below
we
saw
some
ducks
and
shot
at
them
with
a
revolver
but
the
ducks
flew
disdainfully
away
and
landed
in
the
pool
below
by
we
were
twelve
miles
below
the
junction
a
very
good
day
run
considering
the
kind
of
water
we
were
travelling
on
and
the
amount
of
time
we
spent
on
the
shore
we
had
just
run
our
twelfth
rapid
and
were
turning
the
boats
around
when
we
saw
a
man
back
from
the
shore
working
over
a
pile
of
boxes
which
he
had
covered
with
a
piece
of
canvas
a
boat
was
tied
to
the
water
edge
we
called
to
him
and
he
answered
but
did
not
seem
nearly
as
much
interested
in
seeing
companion
travellers
as
we
were
and
proceeded
with
his
work
we
landed
and
to
save
time
introduced
ourselves
as
there
seemed
to
be
a
certain
aloofness
in
his
manner
he
gave
the
name
of
smith
with
some
hesitation
we
thought
smith
was
about
medium
size
but
looked
tough
and
wiry
he
had
a
sandy
complexion
with
light
hair
and
mustache
he
had
lost
one
eye
the
other
was
that
light
gray
colour
that
is
usually
associated
with
indomitable
nerve
he
had
a
shrewd
rather
humorous
expression
and
gave
one
the
impression
of
being
very
capable
dressed
in
a
neat
whipcord
suit
wearing
light
shoes
and
a
carefully
tied
tie
recently
shaved
a
luxury
we
had
denied
ourselves
all
this
time
he
was
certainly
an
interesting
character
to
meet
in
this
place
we
should
judge
he
was
a
little
over
forty
years
old
but
whether
prospector
trapper
or
explorer
it
was
hard
to
say
some
coyote
skins
drying
on
a
rock
would
give
one
the
impression
that
he
was
the
second
with
a
touch
of
the
latter
thrown
in
these
coyotes
were
responsible
for
the
tracks
we
had
seen
and
had
mistaken
for
dog
tracks
but
of
all
the
canyons
we
had
seen
he
was
in
the
last
place
where
we
would
expect
to
find
a
trapper
the
coyotes
evidently
reached
the
river
gorge
through
side
canyons
on
the
left
where
we
had
seen
signs
of
ancient
trails
apart
from
that
there
was
no
sign
of
animal
life
with
the
last
of
the
wooded
canyons
the
signs
of
beaver
had
disappeared
there
were
a
few
otter
tracks
but
they
are
wily
fellows
and
are
seldom
trapped
while
there
are
laws
against
the
trapping
of
beaver
they
seldom
prevent
the
trappers
from
taking
them
when
they
get
the
chance
they
are
only
a
little
more
wary
of
strangers
the
thought
occurred
to
us
that
this
trapper
may
have
secured
some
beaver
in
the
open
sections
above
and
mistrusted
us
for
this
reason
it
was
too
late
to
go
any
farther
that
evening
so
we
camped
a
hundred
yards
below
him
close
to
where
our
boats
were
pulled
out
at
this
place
there
was
a
long
wide
flat
in
the
canyon
with
plenty
of
driftwood
so
we
saw
no
reason
why
we
should
quarrel
with
our
neighbour
smith
accepted
our
invitation
to
supper
stating
that
he
had
just
eaten
before
we
arrived
but
enjoyed
some
pineapple
which
we
had
kept
for
some
special
occasion
and
which
was
served
for
dessert
over
the
table
we
became
better
acquainted
and
after
learning
what
we
were
doing
he
recounted
his
experiences
he
told
us
he
had
left
green
river
utah
a
month
before
and
had
been
trapping
as
he
came
along
he
knew
there
was
a
canyon
and
some
rapids
below
but
had
no
idea
they
were
so
bad
and
thought
they
were
about
ended
no
one
had
warned
him
for
he
had
told
no
one
what
he
intended
doing
he
had
bought
an
old
boat
that
had
been
built
by
galloway
and
seeing
the
uselessness
of
trying
to
run
the
rapids
with
it
worked
it
down
along
the
shores
by
holding
it
with
a
light
chain
once
he
had
been
pulled
into
the
river
twice
the
boat
had
been
upset
and
he
was
just
about
dried
out
from
the
last
spill
when
we
arrived
he
had
heard
us
shooting
at
the
ducks
so
rather
expected
company
this
in
brief
was
his
amazing
story
we
were
surprised
when
we
examined
the
boat
closely
it
had
been
well
made
but
was
so
old
and
rotten
that
it
seemed
ready
to
fall
to
pieces
in
places
the
nail
heads
had
pulled
through
the
boards
it
was
entirely
open
on
top
a
great
risk
in
such
water
his
boxes
were
tied
in
to
prevent
loss
these
boxes
were
now
piled
on
the
shore
with
a
large
canvas
thrown
over
them
this
canvas
fastened
at
the
top
and
sloping
to
the
ground
served
him
for
a
tent
his
bed
was
underneath
a
pair
of
boots
placed
bottom
up
over
two
sticks
stuck
in
the
sand
beside
the
explained
the
different
tracks
we
had
seen
above
smith
evidently
was
not
much
alarmed
over
his
situation
about
the
only
thing
that
seemed
to
bother
him
was
the
fact
that
his
smoking
tobacco
had
been
wet
several
times
that
evening
we
got
out
our
dellenbaugh
a
canyon
voyage
and
tried
to
give
him
an
idea
of
what
was
ahead
the
walls
ahead
grew
higher
and
closer
together
sometimes
there
was
a
shore
on
one
side
sometimes
on
the
other
at
one
or
two
places
there
was
no
shore
on
either
side
and
the
rapids
continued
to
get
worse
so
we
gathered
from
experience
above
this
point
there
were
several
places
where
one
could
climb
out
we
had
even
seen
signs
of
ancient
trails
in
two
side
canyons
below
here
few
such
places
existed
smith
listened
to
all
this
attentively
then
smiled
and
said
i
guess
there
will
be
some
way
through
after
a
short
visit
he
returned
to
his
camp
we
noticed
that
he
slept
on
his
gun
to
keep
it
dry
no
doubt
for
it
looked
like
rain
morning
found
us
very
sorry
that
we
had
not
erected
our
tent
for
it
rained
nearly
all
night
but
when
once
in
our
beds
it
was
a
question
which
was
preferable
to
get
out
in
the
rain
and
put
up
our
tent
or
remain
in
our
comfortable
beds
we
remained
where
we
were
as
we
prepared
to
leave
we
offered
smith
a
chance
to
accompany
us
through
cataract
canyon
telling
him
that
we
would
help
him
with
his
boat
until
the
quiet
water
of
glen
canyon
was
reached
he
declined
the
opportunity
saying
that
he
would
rather
travel
slowly
and
do
what
trapping
he
could
he
welcomed
a
chance
to
take
a
ride
on
the
however
we
took
him
over
two
small
rapids
and
gave
him
an
insight
into
our
method
of
avoiding
the
dangers
he
was
very
enthusiastic
about
it
on
reaching
the
next
rapid
we
all
concluded
it
would
be
very
unwise
to
carry
any
passengers
for
it
was
violent
water
so
he
got
out
on
the
shore
smith
had
once
seen
some
moving
pictures
of
japanese
shooting
rapids
but
he
said
they
were
nothing
compared
to
these
remarking
that
a
bronco
could
hardly
buck
any
harder
the
next
rapid
was
just
as
bad
rapid
no
for
cataract
canyon
and
smith
helped
us
secure
a
motion
picture
then
he
prepared
to
return
to
his
camp
just
before
leaving
he
explained
rather
apologetically
that
ranchers
or
others
were
usually
very
unfriendly
to
a
stranger
coming
into
their
section
of
the
country
he
had
heard
us
shooting
at
the
ducks
and
he
imagined
we
belonged
in
some
of
the
side
canyons
or
on
the
top
this
explained
his
puzzling
attitude
at
our
first
meeting
if
he
had
any
beaver
skins
in
his
pack
this
would
make
him
even
more
suspicious
of
strangers
we
wished
him
nothing
but
the
best
of
luck
and
were
good
friends
when
we
parted
his
decision
to
make
the
trip
alone
poorly
equipped
as
he
was
seemed
like
suicide
to
us
he
promised
to
write
to
us
if
he
got
out
and
with
a
final
wave
of
the
hand
we
left
him
on
the
shore
the
rapid
just
passed
was
possibly
the
scene
of
the
disaster
discovered
by
the
stone
expedition
they
found
a
clumsy
boat
close
to
the
shore
jammed
in
a
mass
of
rocks
smashed
and
abandoned
there
were
tracks
of
three
people
in
the
sand
one
track
being
a
boy
a
coat
was
left
on
the
shore
the
tracks
disappeared
up
a
box
canyon
stone
corresponded
with
the
only
settlements
in
all
that
region
few
in
number
and
far
distant
but
nothing
was
ever
heard
of
them
two
other
parties
have
left
green
river
utah
within
a
year
of
this
find
and
disappeared
in
like
manner
this
seemed
to
be
the
usual
result
of
these
attempts
in
nearly
every
case
they
have
started
in
boats
that
are
entirely
unfitted
for
rough
water
and
seemingly
without
any
knowledge
of
the
real
danger
ahead
try
to
follow
where
others
properly
equipped
have
gone
through
what
a
day
of
excitement
that
was
we
always
thought
we
needed
a
certain
amount
of
thrills
to
make
life
sufficiently
interesting
for
us
in
a
few
hours
time
in
the
central
portion
of
cataract
canyon
we
experienced
nearly
enough
thrills
to
last
us
a
lifetime
in
one
or
two
of
the
upper
canyons
we
thought
we
were
running
rapids
now
we
were
learning
what
rapids
really
were
no
sooner
were
we
through
one
than
another
presented
itself
at
each
of
them
we
climbed
along
the
shores
the
lower
slopes
growing
steeper
the
walls
above
towering
higher
clear
to
the
end
of
the
rapid
looking
upstream
we
could
pick
out
the
submerged
rocks
hidden
in
the
muddy
water
and
looking
like
an
innocent
wave
from
above
twice
we
had
picked
out
channels
in
sharp
drops
after
carefully
observing
their
actions
and
deciding
they
were
free
from
obstructions
when
suddenly
the
waves
would
part
for
an
instant
and
disclose
a
hidden
rock
in
one
case
as
sharp
as
a
hound
tooth
sure
disaster
if
we
ever
struck
it
as
soon
as
we
had
decided
on
a
channel
we
would
lose
no
time
in
getting
back
to
our
boats
and
running
it
for
we
could
feel
our
courage
oozing
from
our
finger
tips
with
each
second
delay
time
and
again
we
got
through
just
by
a
scratch
success
bred
confidence
i
distinctly
remember
feeling
that
water
alone
would
not
upset
the
boat
that
it
would
take
a
collision
with
a
rock
to
do
it
and
each
time
we
got
through
twice
i
almost
had
reason
to
reverse
my
impression
of
the
power
of
water
first
the
stern
rose
up
in
front
of
me
as
if
squaring
off
at
the
tops
of
the
cliffs
then
descended
until
it
seemed
to
be
trying
to
plumb
the
depths
of
the
river
the
waves
rolling
over
me
almost
knocked
me
out
of
the
boat
i
lost
my
hold
on
the
oars
and
grabbed
the
sides
of
the
boat
then
regaining
the
oars
i
finished
the
run
by
pulling
with
the
bow
headed
downstream
for
the
boat
had
swapped
ends
in
the
interval
and
was
heavy
with
about
three
barrels
of
water
in
the
cockpit
i
bailed
out
with
a
grocery
box
kept
under
the
seat
for
that
purpose
it
had
been
growing
quite
cold
and
indisposition
or
what
was
really
acute
indigestion
had
weakened
him
for
the
past
two
days
but
he
pluckily
declined
to
stop
i
was
soaked
with
my
last
immersion
and
chilled
with
the
wind
so
concluded
there
was
no
use
having
him
go
through
the
same
experience
and
i
ran
his
boat
while
he
made
a
picture
we
were
both
ready
to
camp
then
but
there
was
no
suitable
place
and
we
had
to
push
on
to
the
next
rapid
on
looking
it
over
we
almost
gave
up
our
intention
of
running
it
it
was
about
a
fourth
of
a
mile
long
a
mass
of
submerged
rocks
extended
entirely
across
the
river
the
entire
rapid
seemed
impossible
we
finally
concluded
it
might
be
run
by
shooting
up
stern
first
on
a
sloping
rock
near
the
shore
then
return
as
the
current
recoiled
and
ran
back
dividing
on
either
side
of
the
rock
the
only
clear
channel
was
one
about
twelve
feet
wide
between
this
rock
and
the
shore
a
projecting
shore
above
prevented
a
direct
entrance
to
this
channel
we
threw
logs
in
and
watched
their
action
in
each
case
they
paused
when
within
five
or
six
feet
of
the
top
of
the
slope
then
returned
with
the
current
whirled
back
to
the
side
and
shot
through
close
to
the
shore
we
planned
to
go
through
as
close
together
as
possible
emery
was
ready
first
i
held
back
in
a
protecting
pool
waiting
for
him
to
get
out
of
the
way
he
got
his
position
facing
stern
downstream
gave
the
slightest
shove
forward
and
the
released
boat
whizzed
down
for
fifty
feet
and
ran
up
on
the
rock
she
paused
a
moment
as
the
water
prepared
to
return
he
gave
two
quick
pulls
shooting
back
again
slightly
to
the
right
until
he
struck
the
narrow
channel
then
reversed
his
course
and
went
through
stern
first
exactly
as
we
had
planned
it
the
square
stern
buoyed
up
by
the
lifted
the
boat
out
of
the
resulting
wave
as
he
struck
the
bottom
of
the
descent
this
much
of
the
rapid
had
only
taken
a
few
seconds
i
followed
at
once
but
was
not
so
fortunate
the
was
carried
to
the
left
side
where
some
water
dropped
over
the
side
of
the
rock
instead
of
reversing
i
pulled
frantically
seeing
visions
meanwhile
of
the
boat
and
myself
being
toppled
off
the
side
of
the
rock
into
the
boulders
and
waves
below
my
rowing
had
no
effect
whatever
but
the
boat
was
grabbed
by
the
returning
wave
and
shot
as
if
from
a
catapult
back
and
around
to
the
right
through
the
sloping
narrow
channel
my
returning
course
describing
a
half
circle
instead
of
rising
the
pointed
bow
cut
down
into
the
waves
until
the
water
was
on
my
shoulders
emery
turned
his
head
for
an
instant
to
see
what
success
i
was
having
and
his
boat
was
thrown
on
to
a
rock
close
to
the
shore
i
passed
him
and
landed
just
before
going
into
the
next
rapid
i
then
went
back
and
helped
him
off
the
rock
and
he
continued
his
course
over
the
leaping
waves
he
broke
a
rowlock
before
he
landed
and
had
to
use
the
substitute
we
had
hung
beside
it
we
found
a
good
spot
for
a
camp
just
above
the
next
rapid
our
tent
was
stretched
in
front
of
a
large
boulder
a
large
pile
of
driftwood
gave
us
all
the
fuel
needed
and
we
soon
had
a
big
fire
going
and
our
wet
clothes
steaming
on
the
line
chapter
xiv
a
patient
amid
the
cataracts
an
hour
or
so
after
making
our
camp
we
began
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
our
choice
of
a
location
for
a
downpour
of
rain
threatened
to
send
a
stream
of
water
under
the
tent
the
stream
was
easily
turned
aside
while
a
door
and
numerous
boards
found
in
the
drift
pile
made
a
very
good
floor
for
the
tent
and
lifted
our
sleeping
bags
off
the
wet
sand
we
had
little
trouble
in
this
section
to
find
sufficient
driftwood
for
fires
the
pile
at
this
camp
was
enormous
and
had
evidently
been
gathering
for
years
some
of
it
we
could
be
sure
was
recent
for
a
large
pumpkin
was
found
deposited
in
the
drift
pile
feet
above
the
stage
on
which
we
were
travelling
this
pumpkin
of
course
could
only
have
come
down
on
the
flood
that
had
preceded
us
what
a
mixture
of
curios
some
of
those
drift
piles
were
and
what
a
great
stretch
of
country
they
represented
the
rivers
unsatisfied
with
washing
away
the
fertile
soil
of
the
upper
country
had
levied
a
greedy
toll
on
the
homes
along
their
banks
as
well
almost
everything
that
would
float
belonging
to
a
home
could
be
found
in
some
of
them
there
were
pieces
of
furniture
and
toilet
articles
children
toys
and
harness
several
smashed
boats
had
been
seen
and
bloated
cattle
as
well
a
short
distance
above
this
camp
we
had
found
two
cans
of
white
paint
carefully
placed
on
top
of
a
big
rock
above
the
mark
by
some
previous
voyager
the
boats
were
beginning
to
show
the
effect
of
hard
usage
so
we
concluded
to
take
the
paint
along
at
another
point
this
same
day
we
found
a
corked
bottle
containing
a
faded
note
undated
requesting
the
finder
to
write
to
a
certain
lady
in
delta
colorado
a
note
in
my
journal
beneath
a
record
of
this
find
reads
aha
a
romance
at
last
judging
by
the
appearance
of
the
note
it
might
have
been
thrown
in
many
years
before
delta
we
knew
was
on
the
gunnison
river
a
tributary
of
the
grand
river
the
bottle
must
have
travelled
over
two
hundred
miles
to
reach
this
spot
a
letter
which
i
sent
out
later
brought
a
prompt
answer
with
the
information
that
this
bottle
and
four
others
with
similar
notes
were
set
adrift
by
the
writer
and
four
of
her
schoolmates
nearly
two
years
before
an
agreement
was
made
that
the
one
first
receiving
an
answer
was
to
treat
the
others
to
a
dinner
our
find
was
the
second
so
this
young
lady
was
a
guest
instead
of
the
host
emery
took
but
little
interest
in
our
camp
arrangements
this
evening
and
went
to
bed
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
do
so
he
said
little
but
he
was
very
weak
and
i
could
tell
from
his
drawn
face
that
he
was
suffering
and
knew
that
it
was
nothing
but
nervous
energy
that
kept
him
at
his
work
that
and
a
promise
which
he
had
made
to
build
a
fire
within
a
stated
time
now
less
than
two
weeks
away
in
bright
angel
creek
canyon
nearly
three
hundred
miles
below
this
camp
a
signal
to
his
wife
and
baby
that
he
would
be
home
the
next
day
i
was
worried
about
his
condition
and
i
feared
a
fever
or
pneumonia
for
two
or
three
days
he
had
not
been
himself
it
was
one
thing
to
battle
with
the
river
when
well
and
strong
it
would
be
decidedly
different
if
one
of
us
became
seriously
for
the
first
time
in
all
our
experiences
together
where
determination
and
skill
seemed
necessary
to
success
i
had
taken
the
lead
during
the
past
two
days
feeling
that
my
greater
weight
and
strength
perhaps
would
help
me
pull
out
of
danger
where
he
might
fail
in
two
or
three
rapids
i
felt
sure
he
did
not
have
the
strength
to
pull
away
from
certain
places
that
would
smash
the
boats
after
running
the
through
these
rapids
i
suggested
to
him
that
he
would
take
a
picture
while
i
brought
the
down
he
would
stay
near
the
ready
to
aid
in
case
of
emergency
after
being
once
through
a
rapid
i
found
it
quite
a
simple
matter
to
run
the
second
boat
and
the
knowledge
that
he
would
save
me
in
case
of
an
upset
greatly
lessened
any
danger
that
might
have
existed
he
was
too
nervous
to
sleep
and
asked
me
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
boats
before
going
to
bed
they
were
pulled
well
up
on
the
shore
and
securely
tied
i
found
so
that
it
would
take
a
flood
to
tear
them
loose
the
rain
which
had
stopped
for
a
while
began
again
as
i
rolled
into
the
blankets
the
fire
fed
with
great
cottonwood
logs
threw
ghostly
shadows
on
the
cliffs
which
towered
above
us
and
sputtered
in
the
rain
but
refused
to
be
drowned
while
the
roar
of
rapids
nos
and
combined
thundered
and
reverberated
from
wall
to
wall
and
finally
lulled
us
to
sleep
the
rain
continued
all
night
but
the
weather
cleared
in
the
morning
emery
felt
much
the
same
as
he
had
the
day
before
so
we
kept
the
same
camp
that
day
we
took
some
pictures
and
made
a
few
test
developments
hanging
the
or
tent
inside
the
other
tent
for
want
of
a
better
place
to
tie
to
sunday
october
the
we
remained
at
the
same
place
and
by
evening
were
both
greatly
benefited
by
the
rest
on
monday
morning
we
packed
up
again
leaving
only
the
camera
out
and
pictured
each
other
alternately
as
the
boats
made
the
plunge
over
the
steep
descent
in
rapid
no
both
boats
disappeared
from
sight
on
two
or
three
occasions
in
this
rapid
and
emerged
nearly
filled
with
water
the
section
just
passed
is
credited
with
the
greatest
descent
on
the
rivers
a
fall
of
feet
in
of
a
mile
this
includes
the
three
rapids
nos
and
proceeding
on
our
way
the
canyon
narrowed
going
up
almost
sheer
to
a
height
of
feet
or
over
segregated
spires
with
tops
stood
out
from
the
upper
walls
the
rapids
or
cataracts
compared
well
with
those
passed
above
connected
in
some
instances
by
water
instead
of
the
quiet
pools
which
were
usually
found
between
the
rapids
we
ran
ten
rapids
this
day
but
several
of
these
which
were
counted
as
one
were
a
series
of
two
or
three
rapids
which
might
be
one
in
high
water
all
had
a
shore
on
one
side
or
the
other
but
caution
was
imperative
when
crossing
in
the
swift
water
between
the
rapids
a
mishap
here
meant
destruction
we
figured
that
we
had
travelled
about
ten
miles
for
this
day
run
the
menacing
walls
continued
to
go
higher
with
the
next
day
travel
until
they
reached
a
height
of
feet
the
left
wall
was
so
sheer
that
it
almost
seemed
to
overhang
the
little
vegetation
which
we
had
found
on
the
lower
slope
gradually
disappeared
as
the
walls
grew
steeper
but
a
few
scattered
shrubs
and
an
occasional
juniper
grew
on
the
rocky
sides
or
in
one
or
two
side
canyons
which
entered
from
the
south
these
side
canyons
had
the
appearance
of
running
back
for
considerable
distances
but
we
did
not
explore
any
of
them
and
could
tell
very
little
about
them
from
the
river
after
our
noon
lunch
this
day
in
order
to
keep
our
minds
from
dwelling
too
much
on
the
rather
depressing
surroundings
we
proposed
having
a
little
sport
on
two
or
three
occasions
we
had
made
motion
pictures
from
the
deck
of
the
boats
as
we
rowed
in
the
quiet
water
here
we
proposed
taking
a
picture
from
the
boats
as
we
went
over
the
rapids
the
two
boats
were
fastened
stern
to
stern
so
that
the
rowing
would
be
done
from
the
first
boat
my
brother
sat
on
the
bow
behind
with
the
camera
in
front
of
him
holding
it
down
with
his
chin
his
legs
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
boat
with
his
left
hand
clutching
at
the
hatch
cover
and
with
his
right
hand
free
to
turn
the
crank
in
this
way
we
passed
over
two
small
rapids
after
that
one
experience
we
never
tried
it
in
a
large
rapid
as
smith
had
said
a
few
days
before
the
boat
bucked
like
a
broncho
and
emery
had
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
to
stay
with
the
boat
to
say
nothing
of
taking
a
picture
once
or
twice
he
was
nearly
unseated
but
pluckily
hung
on
and
kept
turning
away
at
the
crank
when
it
looked
as
if
he
and
the
camera
would
be
dumped
into
the
river
at
one
point
in
the
lower
end
of
cataract
canyon
we
saw
the
name
and
date
turner
below
this
close
to
the
end
of
the
canyon
were
some
ruins
of
cliff
dwellings
and
a
ladder
made
by
white
men
placed
against
the
walls
below
the
ruins
on
reaching
a
very
deep
narrow
canyon
entering
from
the
south
locally
known
as
dark
canyon
we
knew
that
we
were
nearing
the
end
of
the
rapids
in
cataract
canyon
dark
canyon
extends
a
great
distance
back
into
the
country
heading
in
the
mountains
we
had
seen
to
the
south
when
we
climbed
out
at
the
junction
of
the
green
and
the
grand
pine
cones
and
other
growths
entirely
foreign
to
the
growth
of
the
desert
region
were
found
near
its
mouth
a
flood
had
recently
filled
the
bottom
of
this
narrow
canyon
to
a
depth
of
several
feet
but
the
water
had
settled
down
again
and
left
a
little
stream
of
clear
water
running
through
the
boulders
the
rapid
at
the
end
of
this
canyon
was
one
of
the
worst
of
the
entire
series
and
had
been
the
scene
of
more
than
one
fatality
we
had
been
told
it
had
a
very
difficult
approach
and
swung
against
the
right
wall
then
the
water
was
turned
abruptly
to
the
left
by
a
great
pile
of
fallen
boulders
the
cresting
waves
looked
more
like
breakers
of
the
ocean
than
anything
we
had
seen
on
the
river
we
each
had
a
good
scare
as
we
ran
this
rapid
emery
was
completely
hidden
from
my
view
he
was
nearly
strangled
and
blinded
by
the
waves
for
a
few
seconds
while
struggling
in
the
maelstrom
the
was
dropped
directly
on
top
of
a
rock
in
the
middle
of
this
rapid
then
lifted
on
the
next
wave
i
also
had
a
thrilling
experience
but
avoided
the
rock
in
the
lower
part
of
the
rapid
a
rowlock
pulled
apart
and
to
prevent
the
boat
from
turning
sideways
in
the
rapid
i
threw
up
my
knee
holding
the
oar
against
it
for
a
lever
until
i
was
in
quieter
water
and
could
get
the
other
rowlock
in
position
separated
from
my
brother
in
this
instance
i
had
an
opportunity
to
see
the
man
and
water
conflict
with
a
perspective
much
as
it
would
have
appeared
to
a
spectator
happening
on
the
scene
i
was
out
of
the
heat
of
the
battle
the
excitement
and
indifference
to
danger
that
comes
with
a
grapple
was
gone
i
heard
the
roar
of
the
rapid
a
roar
so
often
heard
that
we
forgot
it
was
there
i
saw
the
gloom
of
the
great
gorge
and
the
towering
sinister
shafts
of
rock
weakened
with
cracks
waiting
for
the
moment
that
would
send
them
crashing
to
the
bottom
i
saw
the
mad
wild
water
hurled
at
the
curving
wall
jagged
rocks
like
the
bared
fangs
of
some
appeared
now
and
then
in
the
leaping
tumbling
waves
then
down
toward
the
turmoil
dwarfed
to
nothingness
by
the
magnitude
of
the
walls
sped
the
tiny
boat
running
smoothly
like
a
racing
machine
there
was
no
rowing
the
were
tipped
high
to
avoid
loss
in
the
first
comber
then
the
boat
was
buried
in
foam
and
staggered
through
on
the
other
side
it
was
buffeted
here
and
there
now
covered
with
a
ton
of
water
now
topping
a
wave
like
a
skilled
boxer
quick
of
eye
and
ready
to
seize
any
temporary
advantage
the
oarsman
shot
in
his
oars
for
two
quick
strokes
to
straighten
the
boat
with
the
current
or
dodge
a
threatening
boulder
then
covered
by
lifting
his
oars
and
ducking
his
head
as
a
brown
flood
rolled
over
him
time
and
again
the
manoeuvre
was
repeated
now
here
now
there
one
would
think
the
chances
were
about
one
to
a
hundred
that
he
would
get
through
but
by
some
sort
of
a
system
undoubtedly
aided
many
times
by
good
luck
the
man
and
his
boat
won
to
land
after
running
a
small
rapid
we
came
to
another
in
the
centre
of
which
was
an
island
the
last
rapid
in
cataract
canyon
while
not
as
bad
as
the
one
at
dark
canyon
it
was
rather
difficult
and
at
this
point
we
found
no
shore
on
either
side
the
south
side
was
rendered
impassable
by
great
boulders
much
higher
than
the
river
level
which
were
scattered
through
the
channel
the
opposite
channel
began
much
like
the
rapid
at
dark
canyon
sweeping
under
the
wall
until
turned
by
a
bend
and
many
fallen
rocks
below
the
end
of
the
island
then
crossed
with
a
line
of
cresting
waves
to
the
opposite
side
where
it
was
joined
by
the
other
stream
and
the
left
wall
was
swept
clean
in
like
manner
we
ran
it
by
letting
our
boats
drop
into
the
stream
but
pulled
away
from
the
wall
and
kept
close
to
the
island
then
when
its
end
was
reached
crossed
the
ridge
of
waves
and
pulled
for
the
shore
in
such
rapids
as
this
we
often
found
the
line
of
waves
in
the
centre
to
be
several
feet
higher
than
the
water
along
the
shore
then
our
thoughts
reverted
to
smith
what
would
he
do
when
he
came
to
this
rapid
the
only
escape
was
a
narrow
sloping
ledge
on
the
right
side
beginning
close
to
the
water
some
distance
above
the
rapid
reaching
a
height
of
sixty
or
seventy
feet
above
the
water
at
the
lower
end
while
a
descent
could
be
made
to
the
river
some
distance
below
here
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
climb
over
this
with
his
provisions
but
the
idea
of
taking
his
boat
up
there
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
and
poorly
equipped
as
he
was
an
attempt
to
run
it
would
surely
end
in
disaster
the
breaking
of
an
oar
the
loss
of
a
rowlock
or
the
slightest
knock
of
his
rotten
boat
against
a
rock
and
smith
fate
would
be
similar
to
those
others
whose
bones
lay
buried
in
the
sands
in
the
next
four
miles
we
had
no
more
rapids
but
had
some
fine
travelling
on
a
very
swift
river
it
was
getting
dusk
but
we
pulled
away
for
just
ahead
of
us
was
the
end
of
cataract
canyon
we
camped
by
a
large
side
canyon
on
the
left
named
mille
crag
bend
with
a
great
number
of
jagged
pinnacles
gathered
in
a
group
at
the
top
of
the
walls
which
had
dropped
down
to
a
height
of
about
feet
we
felt
just
a
little
proud
of
our
achievement
and
believed
we
had
established
a
record
for
cataract
canyon
having
run
all
rapids
in
four
days
travelling
and
come
through
in
safety
we
had
one
rapid
to
run
the
next
morning
at
the
beginning
of
narrow
canyon
the
only
rapid
in
this
long
canyon
the
walls
here
at
the
beginning
were
twelve
or
thirteen
hundred
feet
high
and
tapered
to
the
end
where
they
rise
about
four
hundred
feet
above
the
dirty
devil
river
narrow
canyon
contains
the
longest
straight
stretch
of
river
which
we
remembered
having
seen
when
five
miles
from
its
mouth
we
could
look
through
and
see
the
peak
of
mt
ellsworth
beyond
this
peak
is
one
of
the
five
that
composes
the
henry
mountains
which
lay
to
the
north
of
the
river
three
hours
rowing
brought
us
to
the
end
we
paused
a
few
minutes
to
make
a
picture
or
two
of
the
dirty
devil
river
or
the
frémont
river
as
it
is
now
recorded
on
the
maps
this
stream
flowing
from
the
north
was
the
exact
opposite
of
the
bright
angel
creek
that
beautiful
stream
we
knew
so
well
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
below
this
point
the
dirty
devil
was
muddy
and
alkaline
while
warm
springs
containing
sulphur
and
other
minerals
added
to
its
unpalatable
taste
after
tasting
it
we
could
well
understand
the
feeling
of
the
jack
sumner
whose
remark
after
a
similar
trial
suggested
its
name
to
major
powell
a
short
distance
below
this
we
saw
a
tent
and
found
it
occupied
by
an
named
kimball
among
other
things
he
told
us
that
he
had
a
partner
named
turner
who
had
made
the
trip
through
the
canyons
above
and
arrived
at
this
point
in
safety
this
was
the
man
whose
name
we
had
seen
on
the
walls
in
cataract
canyon
less
than
two
miles
more
brought
us
to
the
hite
ranch
and
john
hite
gave
us
a
cordial
reception
he
had
known
of
our
coming
from
the
newspapers
besides
he
had
some
mail
for
us
we
spent
the
balance
of
the
day
in
writing
letters
and
listening
to
hite
interesting
experiences
of
his
many
years
of
residence
in
this
secluded
spot
hite
home
had
been
a
haven
for
the
sole
survivor
of
two
expeditions
which
had
met
with
disaster
in
cataract
in
each
case
they
were
on
the
verge
of
starvation
hite
kept
a
record
of
all
known
parties
who
had
attempted
the
passage
through
the
canyons
above
less
than
half
of
these
parties
excepting
galloway
several
successful
trips
succeeded
in
getting
through
cataract
canyon
without
wrecking
boats
or
losing
lives
after
passing
the
frémont
river
the
walls
on
the
right
or
north
side
dropped
down
leaving
low
barren
sandstone
hills
rolling
away
from
the
river
with
a
fringe
of
willows
and
shrubs
beside
the
water
and
with
the
usual
prickly
pear
cactus
and
on
the
higher
ground
we
had
seen
one
log
cabin
but
this
ranch
was
the
only
extensive
piece
of
ground
that
was
cultivated
judging
by
the
size
of
his
stacks
of
alfalfa
hite
had
evidently
had
a
good
season
the
banks
of
the
south
side
of
the
river
were
about
two
hundred
feet
high
composed
of
a
conglomerate
mass
of
clay
and
gravel
this
spot
has
long
been
a
ferry
crossing
known
far
and
wide
as
dandy
crossing
the
only
outlet
across
the
river
for
the
towns
of
southeastern
utah
along
the
san
juan
river
the
entire
miles
of
glen
canyon
had
once
been
the
scene
of
extensive
placer
operations
the
boom
finally
died
a
few
claims
only
proving
profitable
one
of
these
claims
was
held
by
bert
loper
one
of
the
three
miners
who
had
gone
down
the
river
in
loper
never
finished
as
his
boat
a
steel
boat
by
the
way
was
punctured
in
a
rapid
above
dark
canyon
but
was
soon
repaired
his
cameras
and
plates
being
lost
he
sent
from
hite
out
for
new
ones
his
companions
chas
russell
and
monette
were
to
wait
for
him
at
lee
ferry
after
having
prospected
through
glen
canyon
some
mistake
was
made
about
the
delivery
of
the
cameras
and
as
hite
only
had
weekly
communication
with
the
railroad
a
month
elapsed
before
he
finally
secured
them
lee
ferry
had
been
discontinued
as
a
at
that
time
and
although
he
tried
to
get
a
letter
in
to
them
it
was
never
delivered
his
disappointment
can
be
imagined
better
than
described
when
he
reached
lee
ferry
and
found
his
companions
had
left
just
a
few
days
previous
they
naturally
thought
if
he
were
coming
at
all
he
would
have
been
there
long
before
that
and
they
gave
him
up
not
knowing
the
cause
of
the
delay
they
left
a
letter
however
saying
they
would
only
go
to
the
bright
angel
trail
and
the
trip
could
be
completed
together
on
the
following
year
loper
spent
many
hard
days
working
his
boat
with
his
load
of
provisions
back
against
the
current
and
located
a
few
miles
below
the
hite
ranch
chapter
xv
placer
gold
we
passed
loper
claim
after
resuming
our
journey
the
next
day
his
workings
were
a
proposition
and
very
ingenious
we
found
a
tunnel
in
the
gravel
a
hundred
feet
above
the
river
and
some
distance
back
from
the
river
bank
a
track
of
light
rails
ran
from
the
river
bank
to
these
workings
the
gravel
and
sand
was
loaded
into
a
car
and
hauled
or
pushed
to
the
bank
then
dumped
into
a
chute
which
sent
it
down
to
the
river
edge
loper
was
not
at
his
work
however
neither
did
we
find
him
at
his
ranch
a
mile
down
the
river
he
had
a
neat
little
place
with
fruit
trees
and
a
garden
a
horse
or
two
and
some
poultry
after
resuming
our
rowing
when
about
a
mile
down
the
river
some
one
called
to
us
from
the
shore
and
loper
himself
came
running
down
to
meet
us
john
hite
had
requested
us
to
stop
and
see
his
brother
cass
hite
who
owned
a
ranch
and
placer
working
nearly
opposite
where
loper
had
halted
us
so
loper
crossed
with
us
as
he
was
anxious
to
know
of
our
passage
through
the
canyons
we
found
in
cass
hite
an
interesting
one
who
had
followed
the
crowd
of
miners
and
pioneers
in
the
west
since
the
discovery
of
gold
on
the
coast
he
was
the
discoverer
of
the
white
canyon
natural
bridges
of
southern
utah
located
between
this
point
and
the
san
juan
river
and
had
been
the
first
to
open
the
ferry
at
dandy
crossings
hite
had
prospected
navajo
mountain
southwest
of
this
point
in
the
early
sixties
about
the
time
of
the
trouble
with
the
united
states
army
under
the
leadership
of
kit
carson
who
dislodged
them
from
their
strongholds
in
the
mountains
after
many
others
had
failed
hite
life
was
saved
on
more
than
one
occasion
by
warnings
from
a
friendly
chief
or
head
man
of
the
western
navajos
known
as
hoskaninni
who
regarded
him
as
a
brother
and
bestowed
on
him
the
name
hosteen
meaning
silver
man
he
is
still
known
by
this
name
and
refers
to
his
pretty
ranch
as
tick
a
bo
a
ute

for
friendly
hite
proudly
quoted
a
poem
written
by
cy
warman
about
the
theme
of
the
indian
regard
for
his
white
friend
warman
had
followed
the
crowd
in
to
this
spot
at
the
time
of
the
boom
looking
for
local
colour
human
local
colour
not
the
glitter
in
the
sands
it
was
at
john
hite
home
where
warman
had
composed
the
one
time
popular
song
sweet
marie
it
would
be
safe
to
say
that
he
brought
his
inspiration
with
him
for
this
was
decidedly
a
country
we
were
told
that
it
had
only
been
visited
by
one
woman
in
the
past
twelve
years
hite
insisted
on
our
remaining
until
the
following
morning
and
we
concluded
that
the
rest
would
do
us
good
he
loaded
us
up
with
watermelons
and
with
raisins
which
he
was
curing
at
that
time
we
spent
a
pleasant
afternoon
under
a
shaded
arbour
listening
to
his
reminiscences
and
munching
at
the
raisins
that
evening
loper
told
us
his
story
of
their
canyon
expedition
he
felt
a
little
bitter
about
some
newspaper
reports
that
had
been
published
concerning
this
expedition
these
reports
giving
the
impression
that
his
nerve
had
failed
him
and
that
for
this
reason
he
had
not
continued
on
the
journey
we
mollified
his
feelings
somewhat
when
we
told
him
that
his
companions
were
not
responsible
for
these
reports
but
rather
that
short
telegraphic
reports
sent
out
from
the
grand
canyon
had
been
misconstrued
by
the
papers
and
that
this
accounted
for
the
stories
which
had
appeared
his
companions
had
remained
at
the
grand
canyon
for
two
days
following
their
arrival
at
bright
angel
trail
they
gave
loper
credit
to
our
certain
knowledge
of
being
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
knew
how
to
handle
the
boats
in
rough
water
when
they
began
the
trip
and
had
stated
that
he
ran
all
the
boats
through
certain
rapids
until
they
caught
the
knack
they
could
not
know
of
his
reasons
for
the
delay
and
at
that
time
had
no
knowledge
of
his
arrival
at
lee
ferry
after
they
had
gone
naturally
they
were
very
much
puzzled
over
his
it
got
quite
cold
that
night
and
we
were
glad
to
have
shelter
of
hite
hospitable
roof
in
our
trip
down
the
river
to
this
point
we
had
seemed
to
keep
even
with
the
first
cold
weather
in
all
places
where
it
was
open
we
would
usually
find
a
little
ice
accompanied
by
frost
in
the
mornings
or
if
no
ice
had
frozen
the
grass
would
be
wet
with
dew
in
the
canyons
there
was
little
or
no
ice
and
the
air
was
quite
dry
naturally
we
preferred
the
canyons
if
we
had
a
choice
of
camps
loper
looked
as
though
he
would
like
to
accompany
us
as
we
pulled
away
the
next
morning
after
having
landed
him
on
the
south
side
of
the
stream
we
at
least
had
full
confidence
in
his
nerve
to
tackle
the
lower
colorado
after
his
record
in
cataract
canyon
the
five
scattered
peaks
of
the
henry
mountains
were
now
to
the
of
us
rugged
and
supreme
in
their
majesty
above
this
desolate
region
signs
of
an
ancient
indian
race
were
plentiful
in
this
section
there
were
several
small
cliff
dwellings
walled
up
in
ledges
in
the
rocks
a
hundred
feet
or
so
above
a
low
flat
which
banked
the
river
at
another
place
there
were
hundreds
of
carvings
on
a
similar
wall
which
overhung
a
little
drawings
of
were
plentiful
there
was
one
representing
a
human
figure
with
a
bow
and
arrow
and
with
a
sheep
standing
on
the
arrow
their
way
of
telling
that
he
got
the
sheep
no
doubt
there
were
masked
figures
engaged
in
a
dance
not
unlike
some
of
the
hopi
dances
of
as
they
picture
them
there
were
geometrical
figures
and
designs
of
many
varieties
a
small
rock
building
half
covered
with
sand
and
the
accumulations
of
many
years
stood
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
and
quantities
of
broken
pottery
were
scattered
about
the
ruin
farther
down
the
river
a
pathway
was
worn
into
the
sandstone
where
countless
bare
and
moccasined
feet
had
toiled
and
climbed
over
the
sloping
wall
to
the
mesa
above
the
ruins
in
this
section
were
not
extensive
like
those
found
in
the
tributary
canyons
of
the
san
juan
river
for
instance
not
a
very
great
distance
from
here
possibly
this
people
stopped
here
as
they
travelled
back
and
forth
trading
with
their
cousins
to
the
north
or
the
dwellings
may
have
been
built
by
the
scattered
members
of
the
tribe
when
their
strongholds
were
assailed
by
the
more
warlike
tribes
that
crowded
in
on
them
from
all
sides
what
a
story
these
cliffs
could
tell
what
a
romance
they
could
narrate
of
various
tribes
as
distinct
from
each
other
as
the
nations
of
europe
crowding
each
other
and
at
the
last
of
this
inoffensive
race
coming
from
the
far
south
it
may
be
driven
from
pillar
to
post
making
their
last
stand
in
this
desert
land
to
perish
of
pestilence
or
to
be
almost
exterminated
by
the
tribes
that
surrounded
them
then
again
when
the
tide
changed
and
a
new
type
of
invader
travelled
from
the
east
pushing
ever
to
the
west
conquering
all
before
them
but
like
the
sphinx
the
cliffs
are
silent
and
voiceless
as
the
hillocks
and
along
the
nile
that
other
desert
stream
with
a
history
no
more
ancient
and
momentous
than
this
that
night
we
camped
opposite
the
ruins
of
a
dredge
sunk
in
the
low
water
at
the
edge
of
the
river
this
dredge
had
once
represented
the
outlay
of
a
great
deal
of
money
it
is
conceded
by
nearly
all
experts
that
the
sands
of
these
rivers
contain
gold
but
it
is
of
such
a
fine
grain
what
is
known
as
flour
gold
and
the
expense
of
saving
it
is
so
great
that
it
has
not
paid
when
operated
on
such
a
large
scale
a
few
placers
in
glen
canyon
have
paid
individual
operators
some
of
these
claims
being
in
gravel
deposits
from
six
hundred
to
eight
hundred
feet
above
the
present
level
of
the
river
on
the
following
day
we
again
entered
deep
canyon
sheer
for
several
hundred
feet
creamy
white
above
with
a
dark
red
colour
in
the
lower
sandstone
walls
that
afternoon
we
passed
a
small
muddy
stream
flowing
from
the
north
in
a
narrow
canyon
this
was
the
escalante
river
a
stream
rising
far
to
the
north
named
for
one
of
the
spanish
priests
who
had
travelled
this
country
both
to
the
north
and
the
south
of
this
point
as
early
as
the
year
about
the
time
when
the
new
england
colonists
were
in
the
midst
of
their
struggle
with
the
mother
country
just
below
the
escalante
river
the
canyon
turned
almost
directly
south
continuing
in
this
general
direction
for
several
miles
a
glimpse
or
two
was
had
of
the
top
of
a
peak
directly
ahead
of
us
or
a
little
to
the
southwest
this
could
be
none
other
than
navajo
mountain
a
peak
we
could
see
from
the
grand
canyon
and
had
often
talked
of
climbing
but
debated
if
we
could
spare
the
time
now
that
we
were
close
to
it
in
all
this
run
through
glen
canyon
we
had
a
good
current
but
only
one
place
resembling
a
rapid
here
below
the
escalante
it
was
very
quiet
and
hard
pulling
was
necessary
to
make
any
headway
we
were
anxious
to
reach
the
san
juan
river
that
evening
but
the
days
were
growing
short
and
we
were
still
many
miles
away
when
it
began
to
grow
dusk
so
we
kept
a
lookout
for
a
suitable
camp
the
same
conditions
that
had
bothered
us
on
one
or
two
previous
occasions
were
found
here
slippery
muddy
banks
and
quicksand
together
with
an
absence
of
firewood
we
had
learned
before
this
to
expect
these
conditions
where
the
water
was
not
swift
the
slower
stream
had
a
chance
to
deposit
its
silt
and
if
the
high
water
had
been
very
quiet
we
could
expect
to
find
it
soft
or
boggy
in
the
canyons
containing
swift
water
and
rapids
we
seldom
found
mud
but
found
a
firm
sand
instead
here
in
glen
canyon
we
had
plenty
of
mud
for
the
river
had
been
falling
the
last
few
days
time
and
again
we
inspected
seemingly
favourable
places
only
to
be
disappointed
the
willows
and
dense
shrubbery
came
down
close
to
the
river
the
mud
was
black
deep
and
sticky
all
driftwood
had
gone
out
on
the
last
flood
meanwhile
a
glorious
full
moon
had
risen
spreading
a
soft
weird
light
over
the
canyon
walls
and
the
river
so
that
we
now
had
a
light
much
better
than
the
dusk
of
half
an
hour
previous
our
course
being
almost
due
south
finally
becoming
discouraged
we
decided
to
pull
for
the
san
juan
river
feeling
sure
that
we
would
find
a
there
it
was
late
when
we
reached
it
and
instead
of
a
we
found
a
delta
of
bottomless
mud
we
had
drifted
past
the
point
where
the
rivers
joined
before
noticing
that
the
stream
turned
directly
to
the
west
with
canyon
walls
two
or
three
hundred
feet
high
and
no
moonlight
entered
there
instead
it
was
black
as
a
dungeon
from
down
in
that
darkness
there
came
a
muffled
roar
reverberating
against
the
walls
and
sounding
decidedly
like
a
rapid
there
was
not
a
minute
to
lose
we
pulled
and
pulled
hard
for
the
stream
was
now
quite
swift
close
to
the
right
shore
and
a
sheer
bank
of
earth
about
ten
feet
high
made
it
difficult
to
land
jumping
into
the
mud
at
the
edge
of
the
water
we
tied
the
boats
to
some
bushes
then
tore
down
the
bank
and
climbed
out
on
a
dry
sandy
point
of
land
at
the
end
or
sharp
turn
of
the
sheer
wall
we
found
a
fair
camp
with
driftwood
enough
for
that
night
emery
weak
from
his
former
illness
and
the
long
day
run
went
to
bed
as
soon
as
we
had
eaten
a
light
supper
i
looked
after
the
cooking
that
evening
making
some
bread
otherwise
known
as
a
flapjack
along
with
other
arrangements
for
the
next
day
but
i
fear
my
efforts
as
a
cook
always
resulted
rather
poorly
we
had
breakfast
at
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
and
were
ready
for
the
boats
at
the
earliest
start
to
our
record
our
rapid
of
the
night
before
proved
to
be
a
false
alarm
being
nothing
more
than
the
breaking
of
swift
water
as
it
swept
the
banks
of
rocks
at
the
turn
it
was
quite
different
from
what
we
had
pictured
in
our
minds
we
had
long
looked
forward
to
this
day
navajo
mountain
with
bare
jagged
sides
and
dome
was
located
just
a
few
miles
below
this
camp
it
was
a
sandstone
mountain
peak
towering
feet
above
the
river
the
steep
slope
beginning
some
five
or
six
miles
back
from
the
stream
the
base
on
which
it
rested
was
of
sandstone
rounded
and
gullied
into
curious
forms
a
warm
red
and
orange
colour
predominating
the
north
side
facing
the
river
was
steep
of
slope
covered
with
the
fragments
of
crumbled
cliffs
and
with
soft
pinnacles
rising
from
its
slope
the
south
side
we
had
reason
to
believe
was
from
top
to
bottom
the
north
side
held
only
a
few
scattered
cedar
piñon
we
had
often
seen
the
hazy
blue
dome
from
the
grand
canyon
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
away
and
while
it
was
fifty
miles
farther
by
the
river
we
felt
as
if
we
were
entered
on
the
home
stretch
as
if
we
were
in
a
country
with
which
we
were
somewhat
familiar
the
colorado
and
the
san
juan
rivers
form
the
northern
boundary
of
the
navajo
indian
reservation
comprising
a
tract
of
land
as
large
as
many
eastern
states
extending
over
a
hundred
miles
both
east
and
west
from
this
point
embodied
in
this
reservation
and
directly
opposite
our
camp
was
a
small
section
of
rugged
land
set
aside
for
some
utes
who
had
friendly
dealings
and
who
had
intermarried
with
the
navajo
but
if
we
expected
to
find
the
navajo
or
utes
on
the
shore
ready
to
greet
us
we
were
doomed
to
disappointment
we
explored
a
few
side
canyons
this
morning
hoping
to
find
a
spot
where
some
of
major
powell
party
particularly
those
men
who
were
afterwards
killed
by
the
indians
had
chiselled
their
names
which
record
we
were
told
was
to
be
found
near
the
san
juan
but
on
which
side
we
were
not
sure
while
in
one
of
these
canyons
or
what
was
really
nothing
more
than
a
crooked
overhanging
slit
in
the
rocks
containing
a
small
stream
emery
found
himself
in
some
soft
quicksand
plunged
instantly
above
his
knees
and
sinking
rapidly
he
would
have
had
a
difficult
time
in
getting
out
of
this
quicksand
without
help
for
a
smooth
rock
wall
was
on
one
side
the
other
bank
of
the
stream
was
sheer
above
him
for
a
few
feet
and
there
was
nothing
solid
which
he
could
reach
we
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
quicksand
before
this
but
nothing
of
this
treacherous
nature
usually
we
could
walk
quickly
over
these
sands
without
any
danger
of
being
held
in
them
or
if
caught
while
lifting
on
a
boat
for
instance
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
out
when
once
out
of
this
canyon
we
gave
up
our
search
for
the
carved
record
but
it
was
not
the
hope
of
shortening
our
homeward
run
or
the
prospect
of
meeting
indians
on
the
shores
or
of
finding
historical
records
even
that
caused
us
to
make
this
early
start
it
was
the
knowledge
that
the
wonderful
rainbow
natural
bridge
recently
discovered
and
only
visited
by
three
parties
of
whites
lay
hidden
in
one
of
the
side
canyons
that
ran
from
the
north
slope
of
navajo
mountain
no
one
had
gone
into
it
from
the
river
but
we
were
told
it
could
be
done
we
hoped
to
find
this
bridge
the
current
was
swift
and
we
travelled
fast
in
spite
of
a
stiff
wind
which
blew
up
the
stream
getting
a
very
good
view
of
the
mountain
from
the
river
a
few
miles
below
our
camp
and
another
view
of
the
extreme
top
a
short
distance
below
this
place
not
over
six
miles
from
the
san
juan
we
had
directions
describing
the
canyon
in
which
the
bridge
was
located
our
informant
surmising
that
it
was
thirty
miles
below
the
san
juan
we
thought
it
must
be
less
than
that
for
the
river
was
very
direct
at
this
place
and
a
person
travelling
over
the
extremely
rough
country
which
surrounded
this
side
of
the
mountain
slope
would
naturally
have
to
travel
much
farther
so
began
to
look
for
it
about
twelve
miles
below
camp
but
mile
after
mile
went
by
without
any
sign
of
the
landmarks
that
would
tell
us
we
were
at
the
bridge
canyon
then
the
river
which
had
circled
the
northern
side
of
the
peak
turned
directly
away
from
it
and
we
knew
that
we
had
missed
the
bridge
at
no
point
on
the
trip
had
we
met
with
a
disappointment
to
equal
that
even
the
loss
of
our
film
after
our
spill
in
lodore
was
small
when
compared
with
it
on
looking
back
over
the
lay
of
the
land
we
felt
sure
that
the
bridge
was
at
one
of
the
two
places
where
we
had
seen
the
top
of
the
mountain
from
the
river
to
go
back
against
the
current
would
take
at
least
three
days
our
provisions
were
limited
in
quantity
and
would
not
permit
it
the
canyon
had
deepened
and
a
second
bench
of
sheer
cliffs
rose
above
the
plateau
making
it
impossible
to
climb
out
so
we
concluded
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
pulled
down
the
stream
trying
to
put
as
many
miles
as
possible
between
ourselves
and
our
great
disappointment
this
afternoon
we
passed
from
utah
into
arizona
for
the
remainder
of
the
trip
we
would
have
arizona
on
one
side
of
the
river
at
least
we
had
much
the
same
difficulty
this
evening
as
we
had
the
night
before
in
finding
a
camp
judging
by
the
evidence
along
the
shore
the
high
water
which
came
down
the
san
juan
had
been
a
torrent
much
greater
than
the
flood
on
the
colorado
and
its
upper
tributaries
chapter
xvi
a
warning
we
camped
that
night
at
the
ute
ford
or
the
crossing
of
the
fathers
a
noted
landmark
of
bygone
days
when
escalante
in
and
others
later
followed
the
trails
across
these
unfriendly
lands
later
marauding
navajo
used
this
trail
crossing
the
canyon
to
the
north
side
raiding
the
scattered
mormon
settlements
bringing
their
stolen
horses
and
even
sheep
down
this
canyon
trail
then
they
drove
them
across
on
a
frozen
river
and
escaped
with
them
to
their
mountain
fastness
the
mormons
finally
tired
of
these
predatory
visits
and
shut
off
all
further
loss
from
that
source
by
blasting
off
a
great
ledge
at
the
north
end
of
the
trail
this
ruined
the
trail
beyond
all
hope
of
repair
and
there
is
no
travel
at
present
over
the
old
ute
crossing
the
fording
of
the
river
on
horseback
was
effected
by
dropping
down
to
the
river
through
a
narrow
side
canyon
and
crossing
to
the
centre
on
a
shoal
then
following
a
centre
shoal
down
quite
a
distance
and
completing
the
crossing
at
a
low
point
on
the
opposite
side
this
was
only
possible
at
the
very
lowest
stage
of
water
the
morning
following
our
arrival
here
we
walked
about
a
mile
up
the
gravelly
slope
on
the
south
side
to
see
if
we
could
locate
the
pass
by
which
the
trail
dropped
down
over
these
walls
the
canyon
had
changed
in
appearance
after
leaving
the
mountain
and
now
we
had
a
canyon
smaller
but
not
unlike
the
grand
canyon
in
appearance
with
an
inner
plateau
and
a
narrow
canyon
at
the
river
while
the
walls
on
top
were
several
miles
apart
and
towering
peaks
or
buttes
rose
from
the
plateau
reaching
a
height
almost
equal
to
the
walls
themselves
the
upper
walls
were
or
white
sandstone
the
lower
formation
was
a
warm
red
sandstone
we
could
not
discover
the
pass
without
a
long
walk
to
the
base
of
the
upper
cliffs
so
returned
to
the
boats
about
this
time
we
heard
shots
seeming
to
come
from
some
point
down
the
river
and
on
the
north
side
later
a
dull
hollow
sound
was
heard
like
pounding
on
a
great
bass
drum
we
could
not
imagine
what
it
was
but
knew
that
it
must
be
a
great
distance
away
we
had
noticed
instances
before
this
where
these
smooth
narrow
canyon
had
a
great
magnifying
effect
on
noises
in
the
section
above
the
san
juan
where
the
upper
walls
overhung
a
little
a
loud
call
would
roll
along
for
minutes
before
it
finally
died
a
shot
from
a
revolver
sounded
as
if
the
cliff
were
falling
our
run
this
morning
was
delightful
the
current
was
the
best
on
which
we
had
travelled
the
channel
swung
from
side
to
side
in
great
half
circles
with
most
of
the
water
thrown
against
the
outside
bank
or
wall
with
a
an
hour
current
close
to
the
wall
we
took
advantage
of
all
this
current
hugging
the
wall
with
the
stern
almost
touching
and
with
the
bow
pointed
out
so
we
would
not
run
into
the
walls
or
scrape
our
oars
then
when
it
seemed
as
if
our
necks
were
about
to
be
permanently
dislocated
from
looking
over
one
shoulder
the
river
would
reverse
its
curve
the
channel
would
cross
to
the
other
side
and
we
would
give
that
side
of
our
necks
a
rest
once
in
a
great
while
i
would
bump
a
rock
and
would
look
around
sheepishly
to
see
if
my
brother
had
seen
me
do
it
i
usually
found
him
with
a
big
grin
on
his
face
if
he
happened
to
be
ahead
of
me
we
rowed
about
twenty
miles
down
the
river
before
we
learned
what
had
caused
the
noises
heard
in
the
morning
on
rounding
a
turn
we
saw
the
strange
spectacle
of
fifteen
or
twenty
men
at
work
on
the
hull
of
a
steamboat
over
sixty
feet
in
length
this
boat
was
on
the
bank
quite
a
distance
above
the
water
with
the
perpendicular
walls
of
a
crooked
side
canyon
rising
above
it
it
was
a
strange
sight
here
in
this
corner
of
the
world
some
men
with
heavy
sledges
were
under
the
boat
driving
large
spikes
into
the
planking
this
was
the
noise
we
had
heard
that
morning
the
blasting
we
learned
later
was
at
some
coal
mines
several
miles
up
this
little
canyon
which
bore
the
name
of
warm
creek
canyon
a
road
led
down
through
the
canyon
making
it
possible
to
haul
the
lumber
for
the
boat
clear
to
the
river
edge
the
nearest
railroad
was
close
to
two
hundred
miles
from
this
place
quite
a
haul
considering
the
ruggedness
of
the
country
the
material
for
the
boat
had
been
shipped
from
san
francisco
all
cut
ready
to
put
together
the
vessel
was
to
be
used
to
carry
coal
down
the
river
to
a
dredge
that
had
recently
been
installed
at
lee
ferry
the
dinner
gong
had
just
sounded
when
we
landed
and
we
were
taken
along
with
the
crowd
there
were
some
old
acquaintances
in
this
group
of
men
we
found
from
flagstaff
arizona
these
men
had
received
a
flagstaff
paper
which
had
published
a
short
note
we
had
sent
from
green
river
utah
they
had
added
a
comment
that
no
doubt
this
would
be
the
last
message
we
would
have
an
opportunity
to
send
out
very
cheering
for
emery
wife
no
doubt
fortunately
she
shared
our
enthusiasm
and
if
she
felt
any
apprehension
her
few
letters
failed
to
show
it
we
resumed
our
rowing
at
once
after
dinner
for
we
wished
to
reach
lee
ferry
miles
distant
that
evening
we
had
a
good
current
and
soon
left
our
friends
behind
us
we
pulled
with
a
will
and
mile
after
mile
was
covered
in
record
time
for
our
heavy
boats
the
walls
continued
to
get
higher
as
we
neared
our
goal
going
up
sheer
close
to
the
river
we
judged
the
greatest
of
these
walls
to
be
about
eleven
hundred
feet
high
after
four
hours
of
steady
pulling
we
began
to
weary
for
ours
were
no
light
loads
to
propel
but
we
were
spurred
to
renewed
effort
by
hearing
the
sounds
of
an
engine
in
the
distance
on
rounding
a
turn
we
saw
the
end
of
glen
canyon
ahead
of
us
marked
by
a
breaking
down
of
the
walls
and
a
chaotic
mixture
of
dikes
of
rock
and
slides
of
brilliantly
coloured
shales
broken
and
tilted
in
every
direction
just
below
this
close
to
a
ferry
we
saw
the
dredge
on
the
right
side
of
the
river
we
were
quite
close
to
the
dredge
before
we
were
seen
some
men
paused
at
their
work
to
watch
us
as
we
neared
them
one
man
calling
to
those
behind
him
there
come
the
brothers
a
whistle
blew
announcing
the
end
of
their
day
labour
and
of
ours
as
well
as
it
happened
there
was
some
cheering
and
waving
of
hats
one
who
seemed
to
be
the
foreman
asked
us
to
tie
up
to
a
float
which
served
as
a
landing
for
three
motor
boats
and
a
number
of
skiffs
a
loudly
beaten
triangle
of
steel
announced
that
the
evening
meal
was
ready
at
a
stone
building
not
far
from
the
dredge
we
were
soon
seated
at
a
long
table
with
a
lot
of
others
as
hungry
as
we
partaking
of
a
and
substantial
meal
we
made
arrangements
to
take
a
few
meals
here
as
we
wished
to
overhaul
our
outfits
before
resuming
our
journey
the
meal
ended
we
inquired
for
the
and
were
directed
to
a
ranch
building
across
the
paria
river
a
small
stream
which
entered
from
the
north
not
unlike
the
frémont
river
in
size
and
appearance
picking
our
way
in
the
darkness
on
boulders
and
planks
which
served
as
a
crossing
we
soon
reached
the
building
set
back
from
the
river
in
the
centre
of
the
ranch
a
man
named
johnson
with
his
family
had
charge
of
the
ranch
and
as
well
mail
is
brought
by
carrier
from
the
south
a
trip
of
miles
through
the
hopi
and
navajo
indian
reservations
johnson
informed
us
that
an
friend
named
dave
rust
had
waited
here
three
or
four
days
hoping
to
see
us
arrive
but
business
matters
had
forced
him
to
leave
just
the
day
before
we
were
very
sorry
to
have
missed
him
rust
lived
in
the
little
mormon
town
of
kanab
utah
eighty
miles
north
of
the
grand
canyon
opposite
our
home
in
addition
to
being
a
cattle
man
and
rancher
he
had
superintended
the
construction
of
a
cable
crossing
or
tramway
over
the
colorado
river
beside
the
mouth
of
bright
angel
creek
not
many
miles
from
our
home
he
also
maintains
a
cozy
camp
at
this
place
for
the
accommodation
of
tourists
and
hunting
parties
which
he
conducts
up
bright
angel
creek
and
into
the
kaibab
forest
it
was
while
returning
from
such
a
hunting
trip
that
we
first
met
rust
many
are
the
trips
we
have
taken
with
him
since
then
emery
with
his
wife
and
the
baby
even
making
the
crossing
and
the
horseback
ride
to
his
home
in
kanab
while
i
had
continued
on
through
to
salt
lake
city
rust
had
been
the
first
to
tell
us
of
galloway
and
his
boating
methods
and
had
given
us
a
practical
demonstration
on
the
river
naturally
there
was
no
one
we
would
have
been
more
pleased
to
see
at
that
place
than
rust
in
our
mail
we
found
a
letter
from
him
stating
among
other
things
that
he
had
camped
the
night
before
on
the
plateau
a
few
hundred
feet
above
a
certain
big
rapid
well
known
through
this
section
as
the
soap
creek
rapid
this
locality
is
credited
with
being
the
scene
of
the
first
fatality
which
overtook
the
expedition
brown
being
upset
and
drowned
in
the
next
rapid
which
followed
after
having
portaged
the
soap
creek
rapid
rust
wrote
also
that
there
was
a
shore
along
the
rapid
so
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
making
the
portage
and
concluded
by
saying
that
he
had
a
very
impressive
dream
about
us
that
night
the
second
of
its
kind
since
we
had
started
on
our
journey
we
understood
from
this
that
he
had
certain
misgivings
about
this
rapid
and
took
his
dream
to
be
a
sort
of
a
warning
rust
should
have
known
us
better
with
all
the
perversity
of
human
nature
that
letter
made
me
want
to
run
that
rapid
if
it
were
possible
why
run
the
rapid
and
get
a
moving
picture
as
it
was
being
done
then
we
could
show
rust
how
well
we
had
learned
our
lesson
so
i
thought
as
we
returned
to
the
buildings
near
the
dredge
but
said
nothing
of
what
was
in
my
mind
to
emery
making
the
mental
reservation
that
i
would
see
the
rapid
first
and
decide
afterwards
the
foreman
of
the
placer
mines
called
us
into
his
office
that
evening
and
suggested
that
it
might
be
a
good
plan
to
go
over
our
boats
thoroughly
before
we
left
and
offered
us
the
privilege
of
using
their
workshop
with
all
its
conveniences
for
any
needed
repairs
he
also
let
us
have
a
room
in
one
of
the
buildings
for
our
photographic
work
this
foreman
mourned
the
loss
of
a
friend
who
had
recently
been
drowned
at
the
ferry
it
seemed
that
the
floods
which
had
preceded
us
especially
that
part
which
came
down
the
san
juan
river
had
been
something
tremendous
rising
feet
at
the
ferry
where
the
river
was
feet
wide
and
rising
much
higher
in
the
narrow
portions
of
glen
canyon
great
masses
of
driftwood
had
floated
down
looking
almost
like
a
continuous
raft
when
the
river
had
subsided
somewhat
an
attempt
was
made
to
cross
with
the
ferry
the
foreman
and
his
friend
with
two
others
and
a
team
of
horses
hitched
to
a
wagon
were
on
the
ferry
when
in
midstream
it
overturned
in
the
swollen
current
three
of
the
men
escaped
the
other
man
and
the
horses
were
drowned
a
careful
search
had
been
made
for
the
body
to
a
point
a
few
miles
down
the
river
then
the
canyon
closed
in
and
they
could
go
no
farther
the
body
was
never
recovered
it
is
seldom
that
the
colorado
river
gives
up
its
dead
the
heavy
sands
collect
in
the
clothes
and
a
body
sinks
much
quicker
than
in
ordinary
water
any
object
lodged
on
the
bottom
is
soon
covered
with
a
the
foreman
knew
this
of
course
yet
he
wished
us
to
keep
a
lookout
for
the
body
which
might
by
some
chance
have
caught
on
the
shore
when
the
water
receded
this
was
as
little
as
any
one
would
do
and
we
gave
him
our
promise
to
keep
a
careful
watch
chapter
xvii
a
night
of
thrills
we
declined
the
offer
of
a
roof
that
night
preferring
to
sleep
in
the
open
here
for
the
evening
was
quite
warm
we
went
to
work
the
next
morning
when
the
whistle
sounded
at
the
dredge
beyond
caulking
a
few
leaks
in
the
boats
little
was
done
with
them
the
tin
receptacles
holding
our
photographic
plates
and
films
were
carefully
coated
with
a
covering
of
melted
paraffine
for
almost
anything
might
happen
in
the
one
hundred
miles
of
rapid
water
that
separated
us
from
our
home
lee
ferry
was
an
interesting
place
both
for
its
old
and
its
new
associations
this
had
long
been
the
home
of
john
lee
well
known
for
the
part
he
took
in
the
mountain
meadow
massacre
and
for
which
he
afterwards
paid
the
death
penalty
here
lee
had
lived
for
many
years
making
few
visits
to
the
small
settlements
to
the
north
but
on
one
of
these
visits
he
was
captured
there
were
six
or
seven
other
buildings
near
the
large
stone
building
where
we
took
our
meals
so
arranged
that
they
made
a
short
street
the
upper
row
being
built
against
a
cliff
of
rock
and
shale
the
other
row
being
placed
halfway
between
this
row
and
the
river
these
buildings
were
all
of
rock
of
which
there
was
no
lack
plastered
with
adobe
or
mud
one
we
were
told
had
been
lee
stronghold
it
was
a
square
building
with
a
few
very
small
windows
and
with
loopholes
in
the
sides
at
the
time
of
our
visit
it
was
occupied
by
two
men
one
a
young
englishman
recently
arrived
from
south
africa
a
in
search
of
novelty
the
other
a
grizzled
much
could
be
written
about
this
interesting
group
of
men
and
their
alluring
employment
there
were
some
who
had
followed
this
work
through
all
the
camps
of
the
west
to
colorado
to
california
and
to
distant
alaska
as
well
they
had
journeyed
but
it
is
doubtful
if
in
all
their
wanderings
they
had
seen
any
camp
more
strangely
located
than
this
hemmed
in
with
canyon
walls
to
us
their
dredge
and
the
steamboat
up
the
river
seemed
as
if
they
had
been
taken
from
the
pages
of
some
romance
or
bit
of
fiction
and
placed
before
us
for
our
entertainment
there
were
other
men
as
well
just
as
interesting
m
their
way
as
the
the
sons
of
some
of
the
owners
of
this
proposition
young
fellows
working
side
by
side
with
the
veterans
as
enthusiastic
as
if
on
their
college
campus
one
feature
about
the
dredge
interested
us
greatly
this
was
a
tube
or
sucker
held
suspended
by
a
derrick
above
a
float
and
operated
by
compressed
air
the
tube
was
dropped
into
the
sand
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
and
would
eat
its
way
into
it
bringing
up
rocks
the
size
of
one
fist
along
with
the
gravel
and
sand
in
a
few
hours
a
hole
ten
or
fifteen
feet
in
depth
and
ten
feet
in
diameter
would
be
excavated
then
the
tube
was
raised
the
float
was
moved
and
the
work
started
again
the
coarse
sand
and
gravel
carried
by
a
stream
of
water
was
returned
to
the
river
after
passing
over
the
riffles
the
screenings
which
remained
passed
over
square
metal
plates
looking
like
sheets
of
tin
covered
with
quicksilver
these
plates
were
cleaned
with
a
rubber
and
the
entire
residue
was
saved
in
a
heavy
metal
pot
ready
for
the
chemist
one
day
only
was
needed
for
our
work
and
by
evening
we
were
ready
for
the
next
plunge
we
might
have
enjoyed
a
longer
stay
with
these
men
but
stronger
than
this
desire
was
our
anxiety
to
reach
our
home
separated
from
us
by
a
hundred
miles
of
river
no
extended
part
of
the
distance
being
entirely
free
from
rapids
we
had
written
to
the
grand
canyon
bidding
them
look
for
our
signal
fire
in
bright
angel
creek
canyon
in
from
seven
to
ten
days
and
planned
to
leave
on
the
following
morning
nothing
held
us
now
except
the
hope
that
the
mail
which
was
due
that
evening
might
bring
us
a
letter
although
that
was
doubtful
for
we
were
nearly
a
week
ahead
of
our
schedule
as
laid
out
at
green
river
utah
as
we
had
anticipated
there
was
no
mail
for
us
so
we
turned
to
inspect
the
mail
carrier
he
was
a
splendid
specimen
of
the
navajo
indian
a
wrestler
of
note
amoung
his
people
we
were
told
large
and
muscular
and
with
a
peculiar
springy
slouchy
walk
that
gave
one
the
impression
of
great
reserve
strength
he
had
ridden
that
day
from
tuba
an
agency
on
their
reservation
about
seventy
miles
distant
this
was
the
first
sign
of
an
indian
that
we
had
seen
in
this
section
although
we
had
been
travelling
along
the
northern
boundary
of
their
reservation
since
leaving
the
mouth
of
the
san
juan
these
indians
have
no
use
for
the
river
being
children
of
the
desert
rather
than
of
the
water
beyond
an
occasional
crossing
and
swimming
their
horses
at
easy
fords
they
make
no
attempt
at
its
navigation
even
in
the
quiet
water
of
glen
canyon
some
of
the
men
showed
this
indian
our
boats
and
told
him
of
our
journey
he
smiled
and
shrugged
his
massive
shoulders
as
much
as
to
say
he
would
believe
it
when
he
saw
it
he
had
an
opportunity
to
see
us
start
at
least
on
the
following
morning
before
leaving
we
climbed
a
mound
on
the
left
bank
of
the
paria
river
directly
opposite
the
lee
ranch
this
mound
is
known
as
lee
lookout
whether
used
by
lee
or
not
it
had
certainly
served
that
purpose
at
some
time
a
circular
wall
of
rock
was
built
on
top
the
mound
and
commanded
an
excellent
view
of
all
the
approaches
to
the
junction
of
the
rivers
this
spot
is
of
particular
interest
to
the
geologist
for
a
great
fault
indicated
by
the
vermilion
cliffs
marks
the
division
between
glen
canyon
and
marble
canyon
this
line
of
cliffs
extends
to
the
south
for
many
miles
across
the
painted
desert
and
north
into
utah
for
even
a
greater
distance
varying
in
height
from
two
hundred
feet
at
the
southern
end
to
as
many
thousand
feet
in
some
places
to
the
north
looking
to
the
west
we
could
see
that
here
was
another
of
those
sloping
uplifts
of
rock
with
the
river
cutting
down
increasing
the
depth
of
the
canyon
with
every
mile
we
had
now
descended
about
feet
since
leaving
green
river
city
wyoming
not
a
very
great
fall
for
the
distance
travelled
if
an
average
is
taken
but
a
considerable
portion
of
the
distance
was
on
quiet
water
as
we
have
noted
with
a
fall
of
a
foot
or
two
to
the
mile
and
with
alternate
sections
only
containing
bad
water
we
were
still
at
an
elevation
of
feet
above
the
and
in
the
miles
of
canyon
ahead
of
us
marble
canyon
and
the
grand
canyon
combined
the
river
descends
feet
almost
a
continuous
series
of
rapids
from
this
point
to
the
end
of
the
grand
canyon
after
a
hasty
survey
from
our
vantage
point
we
returned
to
the
river
and
prepared
to
embark
as
we
left
the
dredge
the
work
was
closed
down
for
a
few
minutes
and
the
entire
crowd
of
men
about
forty
in
number
stood
on
an
elevation
to
watch
us
run
the
first
rapid
the
indian
had
crossed
to
the
south
side
of
the
to
feed
his
horse
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
us
as
we
went
past
him
running
down
to
his
boat
he
crossed
the
river
and
joined
the
group
on
the
bank
about
this
time
we
were
in
the
grip
of
the
first
rapid
a
long
splashy
one
with
no
danger
whatever
but
large
enough
to
keep
us
busy
until
we
had
passed
from
view
a
few
miles
below
this
after
running
a
pair
of
small
rapids
we
reached
a
larger
one
known
as
the
badger
creek
rapid
with
a
drop
in
the
first
feet
succeeded
by
a
hundred
yards
of
violent
water
emery
had
a
little
difficulty
in
this
rapid
when
his
boat
touched
a
rock
which
turned
the
boat
sideways
in
the
current
and
he
was
nearly
overturned
in
the
heavy
waves
which
followed
as
it
was
we
were
both
drenched
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
twelve
miles
below
lee
ferry
we
reached
the
soap
creek
rapid
of
which
we
had
heard
so
much
the
rapid
had
a
fall
of
feet
and
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
most
of
the
fall
occurred
in
the
first
fifty
yards
the
river
had
narrowed
down
until
it
was
less
than
two
hundred
feet
wide
at
the
beginning
of
the
descent
many
rocks
were
smattered
all
through
the
upper
end
especially
at
the
first
drop
on
the
very
brink
or
edge
of
the
first
fall
there
was
a
submerged
rock
in
the
centre
of
the
channel
making
an
fall
over
the
rock
a
violent
current
deflected
from
the
left
shore
shot
into
this
centre
and
added
to
the
confusion
waves
from
the
conflicting
currents
played
jumping
over
or
through
each
other
alternately
clearly
there
was
no
channel
on
that
side
on
the
right
or
north
side
of
the
stream
it
looked
more
feasible
as
the
water
shot
down
a
sloping
chute
over
a
hundred
feet
before
meeting
with
an
obstruction
this
came
in
the
shape
of
two
rocks
one
about
thirty
feet
below
the
other
to
run
the
rapid
this
first
rock
would
have
to
be
passed
before
any
attempt
could
be
made
to
pull
away
from
the
second
rock
which
was
quite
close
to
the
shore
once
past
that
there
was
a
clear
channel
to
the
end
of
the
rapid
if
the
centre
which
contained
many
rocks
was
avoided
below
the
rapid
was
the
usual
whirlpool
then
a
smaller
rapid
running
under
the
left
wall
this
second
rapid
was
the
one
that
had
been
so
fatal
for
brown
the
soap
creek
rapid
in
many
ways
was
not
as
bad
as
some
we
had
gone
over
in
cataract
canyon
but
there
were
so
many
complications
that
we
hesitated
a
long
time
before
coming
to
a
decision
that
we
would
make
an
attempt
with
one
boat
depending
on
our
good
luck
which
had
brought
us
through
so
many
times
as
much
as
we
depended
on
our
handling
of
the
boat
it
was
planned
that
i
should
make
the
first
attempt
while
emery
remained
with
the
camera
just
below
the
rock
that
we
most
feared
with
the
agreement
that
he
was
to
get
a
picture
of
the
upset
if
one
occurred
then
run
to
the
lower
end
of
the
rapid
with
a
rope
and
a
after
adjusting
i
returned
to
my
boat
and
was
soon
on
the
smooth
water
above
the
rapid
holding
my
boat
to
prevent
her
from
being
swept
over
the
rock
in
the
centre
jockeying
for
the
proper
position
before
i
would
allow
her
to
be
carried
into
the
current
once
in
it
seemed
but
an
instant
until
i
was
past
the
first
rock
and
almost
on
top
of
the
second
i
was
pulling
with
every
ounce
of
strength
and
was
almost
clear
of
the
rock
when
the
stern
touched
it
gently
i
had
no
idea
the
boat
would
overturn
but
thought
she
would
swing
around
the
rock
heading
bow
first
into
the
stream
as
had
been
done
before
on
several
occasions
instead
of
this
she
was
thrown
on
her
side
with
the
bottom
of
the
boat
held
against
the
rock
while
i
found
myself
thrown
out
of
the
boat
but
hanging
to
the
gunwale
then
the
boat
swung
around
and
instantly
turned
upright
while
i
scrambled
back
into
the
cockpit
looking
over
my
shoulder
when
i
had
things
well
in
hand
again
i
saw
my
brother
was
still
at
the
camera
white
as
a
sheet
but
turning
at
the
crank
as
if
our
entire
safety
depended
on
it
after
i
landed
the
boat
however
he
confessed
to
me
that
he
had
no
idea
whether
he
had
caught
the
upset
or
not
as
he
may
have
resumed
the
work
when
he
saw
that
i
was
safe
then
we
went
to
work
to
find
out
what
damage
was
done
first
we
found
that
the
case
which
was
supposed
to
be
waterproof
had
a
of
water
inside
but
fortunately
none
of
our
films
were
wet
some
plates
which
we
had
just
exposed
and
which
were
still
in
the
holders
were
soaked
the
cameras
also
had
suffered
we
hurriedly
wiped
off
the
surplus
water
and
piled
these
things
on
the
shore
then
emptied
the
boat
of
a
few
barrels
of
water
this
one
experience
i
suppose
should
have
been
enough
for
me
with
that
rapid
but
i
foolishly
insisted
on
making
another
trial
at
it
with
the
for
i
felt
sure
i
could
make
it
if
i
only
had
another
chance
and
the
fact
that
emery
had
the
empty
boat
at
the
end
of
the
rapid
and
could
rescue
me
if
an
upset
occurred
greatly
lessened
the
danger
the
idea
of
making
a
portage
with
the
loss
of
nearly
a
day
did
not
appeal
to
me
emery
agreed
to
this
reluctantly
and
advised
waiting
until
morning
for
it
was
growing
dusk
but
with
the
remark
i
will
sleep
better
with
both
boats
tied
at
the
lower
end
of
the
rapid
i
returned
to
the
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
missed
my
channel
and
was
carried
over
the
rock
in
the
centre
of
the
stream
the
had
bravely
mounted
the
first
wave
and
was
climbing
the
second
comber
standing
almost
on
end
seemed
to
me
when
the
wave
crested
over
the
stern
while
the
current
shooting
it
from
the
side
struck
the
submerged
bow
and
she
fell
back
in
the
water
upside
down
it
was
all
done
so
quickly
i
hardly
knew
what
had
occurred
but
found
myself
in
the
water
whirling
this
way
and
that
holding
to
the
right
oar
with
a
i
wondered
if
the
strings
would
hold
and
felt
a
great
relief
when
the
oar
stopped
slipping
down
as
the
blade
reached
the
ring
it
was
the
work
of
a
second
to
climb
the
oar
and
i
found
i
was
under
the
cockpit
securing
a
firm
hold
on
the
gunwale
which
had
helped
us
so
often
i
got
on
the
outside
of
the
boat
thinking
i
might
climb
on
top
about
that
time
one
of
the
largest
waves
broke
over
me
knocking
me
on
the
side
of
the
head
as
if
with
a
solid
object
nearly
tearing
me
from
the
boat
after
that
i
kept
as
close
to
the
boat
as
possible
paddling
with
my
feet
to
keep
them
clear
of
rocks
then
the
suction
of
the
boat
caught
them
and
dragged
them
under
and
for
the
rest
of
the
rapid
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
hang
to
the
boat
as
the
rapid
dwindled
i
began
to
look
for
emery
but
was
unable
to
see
him
for
it
was
now
growing
quite
dark
but
i
could
see
a
fire
on
shore
that
he
had
built
i
tried
to
call
but
was
strangled
with
the
breaking
waves
my
voice
was
drowned
in
the
roar
of
the
rapid
one
of
the
was
torn
loose
and
floated
ahead
of
me
finally
i
got
an
answer
and
could
see
that
emery
had
launched
his
boat
as
he
drew
near
i
told
him
to
save
the
which
he
did
then
hurriedly
pulled
for
me
i
remarked
with
a
forced
laugh
to
reassure
him
gee
emery
this
water
cold
he
failed
to
join
in
my
levity
however
and
said
with
feeling
thank
the
good
lord
you
are
here
and
down
in
my
heart
i
echoed
his
prayer
of
thanks
somehow
i
had
lost
all
desire
to
successfully
navigate
the
soap
creek
rapid
but
our
troubles
were
not
entirely
over
emery
had
pulled
me
in
after
a
futile
attempt
or
two
with
a
hold
sometimes
used
by
wrestlers
linking
his
arm
in
mine
leaning
forward
and
pulling
me
in
over
his
back
i
was
so
numbed
by
the
cold
that
i
could
do
little
to
help
him
after
what
i
suppose
was
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
struggle
in
the
water
although
it
seemed
much
longer
than
that
to
me
we
then
caught
the
and
attempted
to
turn
her
over
but
before
this
could
be
done
we
were
dragged
into
the
next
rapid
emery
caught
up
the
oars
while
i
could
do
nothing
but
hold
to
the
upturned
boat
half
filled
with
water
striving
to
drag
us
against
the
wall
on
the
left
side
of
the
stream
it
was
no
small
task
to
handle
the
two
boats
in
this
way
but
emery
made
it
then
when
he
thought
we
were
sure
of
a
landing
the
dragged
us
into
the
river
again
two
more
small
rapids
were
run
as
we
peered
through
the
darkness
for
a
landing
finally
we
reached
the
shore
over
a
mile
below
the
soap
creek
rapid
we
were
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
from
that
where
we
had
unloaded
the
this
material
would
have
to
stay
where
it
was
that
night
while
bailing
the
water
from
the
we
noticed
a
peculiar
odour
and
thought
for
a
while
that
it
might
be
the
body
of
the
man
who
was
drowned
at
the
ferry
but
later
we
found
it
came
from
a
green
cottonwood
log
that
had
become
and
was
embedded
in
the
sand
close
to
our
landing
it
was
emery
turn
to
do
the
greater
part
of
the
camp
work
that
night
while
i
was
content
to
hug
the
fire
wrapped
in
blankets
waiting
for
the
coffee
to
boil
chapter
xviii
marble
halls
and
marble
walls
there
was
little
of
the
spectacular
in
our
work
the
next
day
as
we
slowly
and
laboriously
dragged
an
empty
boat
upstream
against
the
current
taking
advantage
of
many
little
eddies
but
finding
much
of
the
shore
swept
clean
i
had
ample
opportunity
to
ponder
on
the
wisdom
of
my
attempt
to
save
time
by
running
the
soap
creek
rapid
instead
of
making
a
portage
while
we
carried
our
loads
over
the
immense
boulders
that
banked
the
stream
down
to
a
swift
piece
of
water
past
which
we
could
not
well
bring
the
boats
or
while
we
developed
the
wet
plates
from
the
ruined
it
was
with
no
little
surprise
that
we
found
all
the
plates
except
a
few
which
were
not
uniformly
wet
and
developed
unevenly
could
be
saved
it
took
a
day
and
a
half
to
complete
all
this
work
marble
canyon
was
now
beginning
to
narrow
up
with
a
steep
slope
on
either
side
three
or
four
hundred
feet
high
with
a
sheer
wall
of
dark
red
limestone
of
equal
height
directly
above
that
there
was
also
a
plateau
of
red
sandstone
and
distant
walls
topped
with
rock
the
same
formations
with
which
we
were
familiar
in
the
grand
canyon
the
inner
gorge
had
narrowed
from
a
thousand
feet
or
more
down
to
four
hundred
feet
the
slope
at
the
river
was
growing
steeper
and
gradually
disappearing
and
each
mile
of
travel
had
added
a
hundred
feet
or
more
to
the
height
of
the
walls
soon
after
resuming
our
journey
that
afternoon
the
slope
disappeared
altogether
and
the
sheer
walls
came
down
close
to
the
water
there
were
few
places
where
one
could
climb
out
had
we
desired
to
do
so
this
hard
limestone
wall
which
major
powell
had
named
the
marble
wall
had
a
disconcerting
way
of
weathering
very
smooth
and
sheer
with
a
few
ledges
and
fewer
breaks
we
made
a
short
run
that
day
going
over
a
few
rapids
stopping
an
hour
to
make
some
pictures
where
an
immense
rock
had
fallen
from
the
cliff
above
into
the
middle
of
the
river
bed
leaving
a
channel
on
one
side
and
scarcely
any
on
the
other
below
this
we
found
a
rapid
so
much
like
the
soap
creek
rapid
in
appearance
that
a
portage
seemed
advisable
it
was
evening
when
we
got
the
to
the
lower
end
of
this
rapid
after
almost
losing
her
as
we
lined
her
down
and
she
was
wedged
under
a
sloping
rock
that
overhung
the
rapid
we
had
two
ropes
one
at
either
end
attached
to
the
boat
in
this
case
emery
stood
below
the
rock
ready
to
pull
her
in
when
once
past
the
rock
there
was
a
sickening
crackling
of
wood
as
the
deck
of
the
boat
wedged
under
and
down
to
the
level
of
the
water
and
at
call
i
released
the
boat
throwing
the
rope
into
the
river
and
hurried
to
help
him
he
was
almost
dragged
into
the
water
as
the
boat
swung
around
fortunately
striking
against
a
instead
of
the
many
rocks
that
lined
the
shore
we
were
working
with
a
stream
different
from
the
green
river
we
found
and
the
was
taken
from
the
water
the
next
day
and
slowly
worked
one
end
at
a
time
over
the
rocks
up
to
a
level
or
thirty
feet
above
the
river
then
we
put
rollers
under
her
and
worked
her
down
past
the
rapid
this
work
was
little
to
our
liking
for
the
boats
now
pretty
well
weighed
considerably
more
than
their
original
five
hundred
pounds
weight
a
few
successful
plunges
soon
brought
back
our
former
confidence
and
we
continued
to
run
all
other
rapids
that
presented
themselves
this
afternoon
we
passed
the
first
rapid
we
remembered
having
seen
where
we
could
not
land
at
its
head
before
running
it
a
slightly
higher
stage
of
water
however
would
have
made
many
such
rapids
just
below
this
point
we
found
the
body
of
a
bighorn
floating
in
an
eddy
it
was
impossible
to
tell
just
how
he
came
to
his
death
there
was
no
sign
of
any
great
fall
that
we
could
see
he
had
a
splendid
pair
of
horns
which
we
would
have
liked
to
have
had
at
home
but
which
we
did
not
care
to
amputate
and
carry
with
us
on
this
day
travel
we
passed
a
number
of
places
where
the
marble
which
had
suggested
this
canyon
name
to
major
powell
appeared
the
exposed
parts
were
checked
or
seamed
and
apparently
would
have
little
commercial
value
we
passed
a
shallow
cave
or
two
this
day
then
found
another
cave
or
hole
running
back
about
fifteen
feet
in
the
wall
so
suitable
for
a
camp
that
we
could
not
refuse
the
temptation
to
stop
although
we
had
made
but
a
very
short
run
this
day
the
high
water
had
entered
it
depositing
successive
layers
of
sand
on
the
bottom
rising
in
steps
one
above
the
other
making
convenient
shelves
for
maps
and
journals
pots
and
pans
while
little
shovelling
was
necessary
to
make
the
lower
level
of
sand
fit
our
sleeping
bags
a
number
of
small
springs
bubbling
from
the
walls
near
by
gave
us
the
first
clear
water
that
we
had
found
for
some
time
and
a
pile
of
driftwood
caught
in
the
rocks
directly
in
front
of
our
cave
added
to
its
desirability
for
a
camp
firewood
was
beginning
to
be
the
first
consideration
in
choosing
a
camp
for
in
many
places
the
high
water
had
swept
the
shores
clean
and
spots
which
might
otherwise
have
made
splendid
camps
were
rendered
most
undesirable
for
this
reason
so
camp
number
was
made
in
this
little
cave
with
a
violent
rapid
directly
beneath
us
making
a
din
that
might
be
anything
but
reassuring
were
we
not
pretty
well
accustomed
to
it
by
this
time
the
next
day
sunday
november
the
was
passed
in
the
same
spot
the
air
turned
decidedly
cold
this
day
a
hard
wind
swept
up
the
river
the
sky
above
was
overcast
and
we
had
little
doubt
that
snow
was
falling
on
the
kaibab
plateau
which
we
could
not
see
but
which
we
knew
rose
to
the
height
of
feet
above
us
but
a
few
miles
to
the
northwest
of
this
camp
the
sheer
walls
directly
above
the
river
dropped
down
considerably
at
this
point
and
a
break
or
two
permitted
us
to
climb
up
as
high
as
we
cared
to
go
on
the
red
sandstone
wall
which
had
lost
its
level
character
and
now
rose
in
a
steep
slope
over
a
thousand
feet
above
us
these
walls
with
no
growth
but
the
tussocks
of
the
prickly
pear
cactus
the
mescal
and
the
yucca
were
more
destitute
of
growth
than
any
we
had
seen
excepting
the
upper
end
of
desolation
canyon
even
the
upper
walls
lacking
the
growth
of
piñon
pine
and
juniper
which
we
usually
associated
with
them
we
were
now
directly
below
the
painted
desert
which
lay
to
the
left
of
the
canyon
and
no
doubt
a
similar
desert
was
on
the
side
in
the
form
of
a
narrow
plateau
but
we
had
no
means
of
knowing
just
how
wide
or
narrow
this
was
before
it
raised
again
to
the
buckskin
mountains
and
the
kaibab
plateau
the
rapid
below
our
camp
was
just
as
bad
as
its
roar
we
found
on
running
it
the
next
day
most
of
the
descent
was
confined
to
a
violent
drop
at
the
very
beginning
but
there
was
a
lot
of
complicated
water
in
the
big
waves
that
followed
emery
was
thrown
forward
in
his
boat
when
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
chute
striking
his
mouth
and
bruising
his
hands
as
he
dropped
his
oars
and
caught
the
bulkhead
an
extra
oar
was
wrenched
from
the
boat
and
disappeared
in
the
white
water
or
foam
that
was
as
nearly
white
as
muddy
water
ever
gets
i
nearly
upset
and
broke
the
pin
of
a
rowlock
the
released
oar
being
jerked
from
my
hand
sending
me
scrambling
for
an
extra
oar
when
the
boat
swept
into
a
swift
whirlpool
emery
caught
my
oar
as
it
whirled
past
him
the
other
was
found
a
below
in
an
eddy
some
of
the
rapids
in
the
centre
of
marble
canyon
were
not
more
than
feet
wide
with
a
corresponding
violence
of
water
the
whirlpools
in
the
wider
channels
below
these
rapids
were
the
strongest
we
had
seen
and
had
a
most
annoying
way
of
holding
the
boats
just
when
we
thought
we
had
evaded
them
sometimes
there
would
be
a
whirlpool
on
either
side
with
a
sharply
defined
line
of
division
in
the
centre
along
which
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
go
without
being
caught
on
one
side
or
the
other
these
whirlpools
were
seldom
regarded
as
serious
for
our
boats
were
too
wide
and
heavy
to
be
readily
overturned
in
them
although
we
saved
ourselves
more
than
one
upset
by
throwing
our
weight
to
the
opposite
side
a
small
boat
would
have
upset
on
two
occasions
we
were
caught
in
small
whirlpools
where
a
point
of
rock
projected
from
the
shore
turning
upstream
splitting
a
swift
current
and
making
a
very
rapid
and
difficult
whirl
where
the
boats
were
nearly
smashed
against
the
walls
below
all
such
places
were
the
familiar
boils
or
fountains
or
shoots
as
they
are
variously
termed
these
are
the
lower
end
of
the
whirlpools
emerging
often
from
the
quiet
water
below
a
rapid
with
nearly
as
much
violence
as
they
disappeared
in
the
rapids
above
these
would
often
rise
when
least
expected
breaking
under
the
boats
the
swift
upshoot
of
water
giving
them
such
a
rap
that
we
sometimes
thought
we
had
struck
a
rock
if
one
happened
to
be
in
the
centre
of
a
boil
when
it
broke
it
would
send
them
sailing
down
the
stream
many
times
faster
than
the
regular
current
was
travelling
rowing
the
boat
having
about
as
little
effect
on
determining
its
course
as
if
it
was
loaded
on
a
the
other
boat
at
times
just
a
few
feet
away
might
be
caught
in
the
whirlpools
that
formed
at
the
edge
of
the
fountains
often
opening
up
suddenly
under
one
side
of
the
boat
causing
it
to
dip
until
the
water
poured
over
the
edge
holding
it
to
that
one
spot
in
spite
of
every
effort
to
row
away
then
we
would
strike
peaceful
water
again
a
mile
or
perhaps
so
quiet
that
a
thin
covering
of
clear
water
over
the
top
of
the
pool
beneath
reflecting
the
tinted
walls
and
the
turquoise
sky
beneath
its
limpid
surface
gems
of
sunlight
sparkled
on
its
bosom
and
scintillated
in
the
ripples
left
behind
by
the
oars
when
seated
with
our
backs
to
the
strongest
light
and
when
glancing
along
the
top
of
such
a
pool
instead
of
into
it
the
surface
gave
way
to
a
peculiar
purplish
tone
which
seemed
to
cover
the
pool
so
that
one
would
forget
it
was
roily
water
and
saw
only
the
iridescent
beauty
of
a
mountain
stream
the
wonderful
marble
walls
better
known
to
the
miners
as
the
blue
limestone
walls
now
rose
from
the
water
edge
to
a
height
of
eight
or
nine
hundred
feet
the
surface
of
its
light
rock
being
stained
to
a
dark
red
or
a
light
red
as
the
case
might
be
by
the
iron
from
the
sandstone
walls
above
there
were
a
thousand
feet
of
these
sandstone
layers
red
in
all
its
varying
hues
capped
by
the
foot
sandstone
wall
breaking
sheer
ranging
in
tone
from
a
soft
buff
to
a
golden
yellow
with
a
bloom
or
glow
as
though
illuminated
from
within
as
we
proceeded
another
layer
could
be
seen
above
this
the
same
limestone
and
with
the
same
fossils
an
examination
of
the
told
us
as
the
topmost
formation
at
the
grand
canyon
this
was
not
unlike
the
sandstone
in
colour
but
lacked
its
warmth
and
richness
of
tint
a
close
examination
of
the
rocks
revealed
many
colours
that
figured
but
little
in
the
grand
colour
scheme
of
the
canyon
as
a
whole
the
detailed
ornamentation
of
the
magnificent
rock
structure
a
fracture
of
wall
would
show
the
true
colour
of
the
rock
beneath
the
stain
lime
crystals
studded
its
surface
like
gems
glinting
in
the
sunlight
beautifully
tinted
jasper
resembling
the
petrified
wood
found
in
another
part
of
arizona
was
embedded
in
the
marble
wall
usually
at
the
point
of
contact
with
another
formation
polished
by
the
sands
of
the
turbid
river
all
this
told
us
that
we
were
coming
into
our
own
four
of
the
seven
notable
divisions
of
rock
strata
found
in
the
grand
canyon
were
now
represented
in
marble
canyon
and
soon
the
green
shale
which
underlies
the
blue
limestone
began
to
crop
out
by
the
river
as
the
walls
grew
higher
and
the
stream
cut
deeper
one
turn
of
the
canyon
revealed
a
break
where
stanton
hid
his
provisions
in
a
cave
after
a
second
fatality
in
which
two
more
of
this
expedition
lost
their
lives
and
climbed
out
on
top
afterwards
he
with
heavier
boats
and
tackled
the
stream
again
just
below
this
break
the
scene
changed
as
we
made
a
sharp
turn
to
the
left
vasey
paradise
named
by
major
powell
after
geo
vasey
botanist
of
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
was
disclosed
to
view
beautiful
streams
gushed
from
rounded
holes
fifty
yards
above
the
river
the
rock
walls
reminded
one
of
an
castle
of
old
england
guarded
by
a
moat
uncrossed
by
any
drawbridge
it
was
trellised
with
vines
maidenhair
ferns
and
making
a
vivid
green
background
for
the
golden
yellow
and
burnished
copper
leaves
which
still
clung
to
some
small
cottonwood
trees
the
only
trees
we
had
seen
in
marble
canyon
in
our
haste
to
push
on
we
left
the
brass
tripod
head
on
an
island
from
which
we
pictured
this
lovely
spot
a
rapid
was
put
behind
us
before
we
noticed
our
loss
and
there
was
no
going
back
then
another
turn
revealed
a
gothic
arch
or
grotto
carved
at
the
bend
of
the
wall
by
the
high
water
with
an
overhang
of
more
than
a
hundred
feet
and
a
height
nearly
as
great
for
the
flood
waters
ran
above
the
stage
in
this
narrow
walled
section
then
came
a
gloomy
formation
with
a
bridge
of
sighs
two
hundred
feet
above
a
gulch
connecting
the
dungeon
to
the
perpendicular
wall
beyond
and
with
a
hundred
openings
in
its
sheer
sides
like
small
windows
admitting
a
little
daylight
into
its
dark
interior
the
sullen
boom
of
a
rapid
around
the
turn
sounded
like
the
march
of
an
army
coming
up
the
gorge
so
we
climbed
back
into
our
boats
after
a
vain
attempt
to
climb
up
to
some
of
the
caves
and
advanced
to
meet
our
foe
this
rapid
the
tenth
for
the
day
while
it
was
clear
of
rocks
had
an
abrupt
drop
with
powerful
waves
which
did
all
sorts
of
things
to
us
and
to
our
boats
breaking
a
rowlock
and
the
four
pieces
of
line
which
held
it
and
flooding
us
both
with
a
ton
of
water
we
went
into
camp
a
short
distance
below
this
in
a
narrow
box
canyon
running
back
a
hundred
yards
from
the
river
a
gloomy
interior
with
sheer
walls
rising
several
hundred
feet
on
three
sides
of
us
and
with
the
top
of
the
south
wall
feet
above
us
in
plain
sight
of
our
camp
the
one
camp
in
marble
canyon
where
our
sleep
was
undisturbed
by
the
roar
of
a
rapid
but
instead
of
the
roar
of
a
rapid
a
howling
wind
swept
down
from
the
painted
desert
above
piling
the
mingled
desert
sands
and
river
sands
about
our
beds
scattering
our
camp
material
over
the
bottom
of
the
narrow
gorge
soon
after
this
camp
the
fourth
and
the
last
in
marble
canyon
was
left
behind
us
the
walls
began
to
widen
out
especially
on
the
and
by
noon
we
had
passed
from
the
narrow
direct
canyon
into
one
with
slopes
and
plateaus
breaking
the
sheer
walls
the
wall
on
the
left
or
southeast
side
being
much
the
lower
of
the
two
and
more
nearly
perpendicular
rising
to
a
height
of
feet
while
the
northwest
side
lifted
up
to
the
kaibab
plateau
one
point
miles
back
from
the
river
rising
feet
above
us
we
halted
at
noon
beside
the
nancoweep
valley
a
wide
tributary
heading
many
miles
back
in
the
plateau
the
right
with
a
ramified
series
of
canyons
running
into
it
and
with
great
expanses
of
flats
between
deer
tracks
were
found
on
these
flats
deer
which
came
down
from
the
forest
of
the
buckskin
mountains
this
was
the
point
selected
by
major
powell
for
the
construction
of
a
trail
when
he
returned
from
his
voyage
of
exploration
to
study
the
geology
of
this
section
the
trail
although
neglected
for
many
years
is
still
used
by
prospectors
from
kanab
utah
who
make
a
yearly
trip
into
the
canyons
to
do
some
work
on
a
mineral
ledge
a
few
miles
below
here
what
a
glorious
exhilarating
run
we
had
that
day
from
here
to
the
end
of
marble
canyon
the
rapids
were
almost
continuous
with
few
violent
drops
and
seldom
broken
by
the
usual
quiet
pools
it
was
the
finest
kind
of
water
for
fast
travelling
and
we
made
the
most
of
it
the
only
previous
run
we
had
made
that
could
in
any
way
compare
with
it
was
in
whirlpool
and
split
mountain
canyons
when
the
high
water
was
on
as
we
travelled
occasional
glimpses
were
had
of
familiar
places
on
greenland
point
that
peninsula
of
the
kaibab
plateau
extending
between
marble
canyon
and
the
grand
canyon
where
we
had
gone
or
on
photographic
expeditions
with
rust
another
valley
from
the
right
was
passed
then
a
peak
rose
before
us
close
to
the
river
with
its
flat
top
rising
to
a
height
equal
to
the
south
wall
this
was
chuar
butte
once
more
we
were
in
a
narrow
canyon
narrowing
by
this
peak
but
a
canyon
just
the
same
soon
we
were
below
a
wall
we
once
had
photographed
from
the
mouth
of
the
little
colorado
then
the
stream
itself
came
into
view
and
we
were
soon
anchored
beside
it
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
grand
canyon
chapter
xix
signalling
our
canyon
home
how
long
we
had
waited
for
this
view
how
many
memories
it
recalled
and
how
different
it
seemed
to
our
previous
visit
there
then
the
high
water
was
on
and
the
mineral
water
of
the
colorado
chiquito
was
backed
up
by
the
turbid
flood
waters
of
the
rio
colorado
forty
feet
or
more
above
the
present
level
now
it
was
a
rapid
stream
throwing
itself
with
wild
abandon
over
the
rocks
and
into
the
colorado
there
was
the
same
deserted
stone
hut
built
by
a
french
prospector
many
years
before
and
a
plough
that
he
had
packed
in
over
a
trail
the
most
difficult
one
in
all
this
rugged
region
there
was
the
little
where
we
pastured
the
burro
while
we
made
a
walk
up
the
bed
of
this
narrow
canyon
what
a
hard
hot
journey
it
had
been
a
year
and
a
half
ago
we
sat
on
that
rock
and
talked
of
the
day
when
we
should
come
through
here
in
boats
even
then
we
talked
of
building
a
raft
and
of
loading
the
burro
on
it
for
a
spin
on
the
flood
waters
lucky
for
us
and
for
the
burro
that
we
did
we
understand
the
temper
of
these
waters
now
cape
desolation
a
point
of
the
painted
desert
on
the
west
side
of
the
little
colorado
was
almost
directly
above
us
feet
high
chuar
butte
equally
as
high
and
with
walls
just
as
nearly
perpendicular
extended
on
into
the
grand
canyon
on
the
right
side
making
the
narrowest
canyon
of
this
depth
that
we
had
seen
the
navajo
reservation
terminated
at
the
little
colorado
although
nothing
but
the
maps
indicated
that
we
had
passed
from
the
land
of
the
red
man
to
that
of
the
white
both
were
equally
desolate
and
equally
wonderful
with
the
entrance
of
the
new
stream
the
canyon
changes
its
southwest
trend
and
turns
directly
west
and
continues
to
hold
to
this
general
direction
until
the
northwest
corner
of
arizona
is
reached
but
we
must
be
on
again
soon
familiar
segregated
peaks
in
the
grand
canyon
began
to
appear
there
was
wotan
throne
on
the
right
and
the
copper
mine
mesa
on
the
left
three
or
four
miles
below
the
junction
a
foot
perpendicular
wall
rose
above
us
the
burro
on
our
previous
visit
was
almost
shoved
off
that
cliff
when
the
pack
caught
on
a
rock
and
was
only
saved
by
strenuous
pulling
on
the
and
pack
harness
soon
we
passed
some
tunnels
on
both
sides
of
the
river
where
the
mormon
miners
had
tapped
a
copper
ledge
at
we
were
at
the
end
of
the
tanner
trail
the
outlet
of
the
little
colorado
trail
to
the
rim
above
it
had
taken
seven
hours
of
toil
to
cover
the
same
ground
we
now
sped
over
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
major
powell
in
found
here
the
remnant
of
a
very
small
hut
built
of
mesquite
logs
but
whether
the
remains
of
an
indian
or
white
man
shelter
can
not
be
stated
the
trail
without
doubt
was
used
by
the
indians
before
the
white
man
invaded
this
region
the
canyon
had
changed
again
from
one
which
was
very
narrow
to
one
much
more
complex
greater
and
grander
the
walls
on
top
were
many
miles
apart
comanche
point
to
our
left
was
over
feet
above
us
desert
view
moran
point
and
other
points
on
the
south
rim
were
even
higher
on
the
right
we
could
see
an
arch
near
cape
final
on
greenland
point
over
feet
up
that
we
had
photographed
from
the
top
a
few
years
before
temples
the
formation
so
typical
of
the
grand
canyon
clustered
on
all
sides
the
upper
walls
were
similar
in
tint
to
those
in
marble
canyon
but
here
at
the
river
was
a
new
formation
the
algonkian
composed
of
thousands
of
brilliantly
coloured
bands
of
rock
standing
at
an
angle
the
one
irregularity
to
the
uniform
layers
of
rock
a
remnant
of
thousands
of
feet
of
rock
which
once
covered
this
region
then
was
planed
away
before
the
other
deposits
were
placed
all
about
us
close
to
the
river
was
a
deep
soft
sand
formed
by
the
disintegration
of
the
rocks
above
as
brilliantly
coloured
as
the
rocks
from
which
they
came
what
had
been
a
very
narrow
stream
above
here
spread
out
over
a
thousand
feet
wide
ran
with
a
good
current
and
seemed
to
be
anything
but
a
shallow
stream
at
that
we
had
travelled
far
that
day
but
still
sped
on
with
a
few
rapids
which
did
not
retard
but
rather
helped
us
on
our
way
and
with
a
good
current
between
these
rapids
only
stopping
to
camp
when
a
foot
wall
rose
sheer
from
the
river
edge
bringing
to
an
end
our
river
bottom
where
one
could
walk
out
on
either
side
it
was
not
necessary
to
hunt
for
driftwood
this
evening
for
a
thicket
of
mesquite
the
best
of
all
wood
for
a
grew
out
of
the
and
some
dead
logs
were
unearthed
from
the
drifted
sand
and
soon
reduced
to
glowing
coals
meanwhile
we
were
enjoying
one
of
those
remarkable
arizona
desert
sunsets
ominous
clouds
had
been
gathering
in
the
afternoon
rising
from
the
southwest
drifting
across
the
canyon
and
piling
up
against
the
north
wall
a
few
fleecy
clouds
in
the
west
partially
obscured
the
sun
until
it
neared
the
horizon
then
a
shaft
of
sunlight
broke
through
once
more
telegraphing
its
approach
long
before
it
reached
us
the
rays
being
visibly
hurled
through
space
like
a
javelin
or
a
lightning
bolt
striking
peak
after
peak
so
that
one
almost
imagined
they
would
hear
the
thunder
roll
a
yellow
flame
covered
the
western
sky
to
be
succeeded
in
a
few
minutes
by
a
crimson
glow
the
sharply
defined
colours
of
the
different
layers
of
rock
had
merged
and
softened
as
the
sun
dropped
from
sight
purple
shadows
crept
into
the
cavernous
depths
while
shafts
of
gold
shot
to
the
very
tiptop
of
the
peaks
or
threw
their
shadows
like
silhouettes
on
the
wall
beyond
then
the
scene
shifted
again
and
it
was
all
reflecting
from
the
sky
and
staining
the
rocks
below
so
that
distant
wall
and
sky
merged
with
little
to
show
where
the
one
ended
and
the
other
began
that
beautiful
haze
which
tints
but
does
not
obscure
enshrouded
the
temples
and
spires
changing
from
heliotrope
to
lavender
from
lavender
to
deepest
purple
there
was
a
departing
flare
of
flame
like
the
collapse
of
a
burning
building
a
few
clouds
in
the
zenith
torn
by
the
winds
so
that
they
resembled
the
craters
of
the
moon
were
tinted
for
an
instant
around
the
crater
rims
the
clouds
faded
to
a
gray
they
darkened
the
gray
disappeared
the
purple
crept
from
the
canyon
into
the
arched
dome
overhead
the
day
was
ended
twilight
passed
and
darkness
settled
over
all
we
sat
silently
by
the
fire
for
a
few
minutes
then
rose
and
resumed
our
evening
work
this
camp
was
at
a
point
that
could
be
seen
from
the
grand
view
hotel
fourteen
miles
from
our
home
we
talked
of
building
a
signal
fire
on
the
promontory
above
the
camp
knowing
that
the
news
would
be
telephoned
to
home
if
the
fire
was
seen
but
we
gave
up
the
plan
although
less
than
twenty
miles
from
bright
angel
trail
we
were
not
safely
through
by
any
means
two
boats
had
been
wrecked
or
lost
in
different
rapids
less
than
six
miles
from
this
camp
the
fall
in
the
hance
or
red
canyon
rapid
was
three
miles
below
us
the
sockdologer
the
grapevine
and
other
rapids
nearly
as
large
followed
those
we
might
be
no
more
fortunate
than
the
others
and
a
delay
after
once
giving
a
signal
would
cause
more
anxiety
than
no
signal
at
all
we
thought
and
the
fire
was
not
built
particular
attention
was
paid
to
the
loading
of
the
boats
the
next
morning
the
film
was
tucked
in
the
toes
of
our
sleeping
bags
and
the
protecting
bags
were
carefully
laced
we
were
not
going
to
take
any
chances
in
this
next
plunge
the
entrance
to
the
granite
gorge
a
run
and
a
dash
through
one
violent
rapid
landed
us
at
the
end
of
the
hance
trail
unused
for
tourist
travel
for
several
years
with
a
few
torn
and
tattered
tents
back
in
the
side
canyon
down
which
the
trail
wound
its
way
we
half
hoped
that
we
would
find
some
of
the
prospectors
who
make
this
section
their
winter
home
either
at
the
tanner
or
the
hance
trail
but
there
was
no
sign
of
recent
visitors
at
either
place
unless
it
was
the
numerous
burro
tracks
in
the
sand
these
tracks
were
doubtless
made
by
some
of
the
many
wild
burros
that
roam
all
the
lower
plateaus
in
the
upper
end
of
the
grand
canyon
after
a
careful
inspection
of
the
hance
rapid
we
were
glad
the
signal
fire
was
not
built
it
was
a
nasty
rapid
while
reading
over
our
notes
one
evening
we
were
amused
to
find
that
we
had
catalogued
different
rapids
with
an
equal
amount
of
fall
as
good
bad
or
nasty
the
difference
depending
nearly
altogether
on
the
rocks
in
the
rapids
the
good
rapids
were
nothing
but
a
descent
of
big
water
with
great
waves
for
which
we
cared
little
but
rather
enjoyed
if
it
was
not
too
cold
and
with
no
danger
from
rocks
the
bad
rapids
contained
rocks
and
twisting
channels
but
with
half
a
chance
of
getting
through
a
nasty
rapid
was
filled
with
rocks
many
of
them
so
concealed
in
the
foam
that
it
was
often
next
to
impossible
to
tell
if
rocks
were
there
or
not
and
in
which
there
was
little
chance
of
running
through
without
smashing
a
boat
the
hance
rapid
was
such
a
one
such
a
complication
of
twisted
channels
and
protruding
rocks
we
had
not
seen
unless
it
was
at
hell
half
mile
it
meant
a
portage
nothing
less
the
second
since
leaving
that
other
rapid
in
lodore
so
we
went
to
work
carrying
our
duffle
across
deep
soft
down
to
the
middle
of
the
rapid
where
quieted
for
a
hundred
yards
before
it
made
the
final
plunge
the
gathering
dusk
of
evening
found
all
material
and
one
boat
at
this
spot
with
the
other
one
at
the
head
of
the
rapid
to
be
portaged
the
next
day
but
we
did
not
portage
this
boat
a
good
night
rest
and
the
safeguard
of
a
boat
at
the
bottom
of
the
plunge
made
it
look
much
less
dangerous
and
five
minutes
after
breakfast
was
finished
this
boat
was
beside
its
mate
and
we
had
a
reel
of
film
which
we
hoped
would
show
just
how
we
successfully
ran
this
difficult
rapid
while
going
over
the
second
section
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
emery
was
thrown
out
of
his
boat
for
an
instant
when
the
touched
a
rock
in
a
mile
an
hour
current
similar
to
my
first
upset
in
the
soap
creek
rapid
the
old
story
out
again
in
again
on
again
landing
in
safety
at
the
end
of
the
rapid
not
one
whit
the
worse
for
the
spill
this
rapid
marks
the
place
where
the
granite
or
igneous
rock
intrudes
rising
at
a
sharp
angle
sloping
upward
down
the
stream
reaching
the
height
of
feet
about
one
mile
below
it
marks
the
end
of
the
large
deposit
of
algonkian
the
granite
when
it
attains
its
highest
point
is
covered
with
a
layer
of
sedimentary
rock
called
the
tonto
sandstone
the
top
of
this
formation
is
exposed
by
a
plateau
from
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
three
miles
in
width
on
either
side
of
the
granite
gorge
the
same
walls
which
were
found
in
marble
canyon
rise
above
this
the
temples
which
are
scattered
through
the
canyon
equal
in
height
in
many
cases
to
the
walls
have
their
foundation
on
this
plateau
these
peaks
contain
the
same
stratified
rock
with
a
uniform
thickness
whether
in
peak
or
wall
with
little
displacement
and
little
sign
of
violent
uplift
nearly
all
this
canyon
being
the
work
of
erosion
feet
from
the
rim
to
the
river
the
edges
of
six
great
layers
of
sedimentary
rock
laid
bare
and
with
a
narrow
gorge
through
the
igneous
rock
below
the
grand
canyon
of
arizona
the
granite
gorge
seemed
to
us
to
be
the
one
place
of
all
others
that
we
had
seen
on
this
trip
that
would
cause
one
to
hesitate
a
long
time
before
entering
if
nothing
definite
was
known
of
its
nature
another
person
might
have
felt
the
same
way
of
the
canyons
we
had
passed
lodore
or
marble
canyon
for
instance
a
great
deal
depends
on
the
nerves
and
digestion
no
doubt
and
the
same
person
would
look
at
it
in
a
different
light
at
different
times
as
we
found
from
our
own
experiences
our
digestions
were
in
excellent
condition
just
at
that
time
and
we
were
nerved
up
by
the
thought
that
we
were
going
to
the
plate
for
a
home
run
if
possible
yet
the
granite
gorge
had
a
decidedly
sinister
look
the
walls
while
not
sheer
were
nearly
so
they
might
be
climbed
in
many
places
to
the
top
of
the
granite
but
the
tonto
sandstone
wall
nearly
always
overhangs
this
breaks
sheer
and
seldom
affords
an
outlet
to
the
plateaus
above
except
where
lateral
canyons
cut
through
the
rocks
are
very
dark
with
dikes
of
quartz
and
with
twisting
seams
of
red
and
black
granite
the
great
body
of
rock
being
made
up
of
decomposed
micaceous
schists
and
gneiss
a
treacherous
material
to
climb
the
entrance
to
this
gorge
is
made
on
a
quiet
pool
with
no
shore
on
either
side
after
once
well
in
but
several
parties
had
been
through
since
major
powell
made
his
initial
trip
so
we
did
not
hesitate
but
pushed
on
with
the
current
now
we
could
truly
say
that
we
were
going
home
the
hance
rapid
was
behind
us
bright
angel
creek
was
about
twelve
miles
away
soon
we
were
in
the
deepest
part
of
the
gorge
great
dikes
and
uplifts
of
jagged
rocks
towered
above
us
and
up
up
up
lifted
the
other
walls
above
that
bissell
point
on
the
very
top
could
plainly
be
seen
from
our
quiet
pool
then
came
a
series
of
rapids
quite
different
from
the
hance
rapid
and
many
others
found
above
those
others
were
usually
caused
in
part
by
the
detritus
or
deposit
from
side
canyons
which
dammed
the
stream
and
what
might
be
a
swift
stream
with
a
continuous
drop
was
transformed
to
a
succession
of
and
cataracts
or
rapids
in
nearly
every
case
in
low
water
such
as
we
were
travelling
on
the
deposit
made
a
shore
on
which
we
could
land
and
inspect
the
rapid
from
below
the
swift
water
invariably
makes
a
narrow
channel
if
it
has
no
obstruction
in
its
way
it
is
the
quiet
stream
that
makes
a
wide
channel
but
the
rapids
we
found
this
day
were
nearly
all
different
they
were
seldom
caused
by
great
deposits
of
rock
but
appeared
to
be
formed
by
a
dike
or
ledge
of
hard
rock
rising
from
the
softer
rock
the
same
intrusion
being
sometimes
found
on
both
sides
of
the
stream
forming
a
dam
the
full
width
of
the
channel
over
which
the
water
made
a
swift
descent
with
a
long
line
of
interference
waves
below
but
for
a
cold
wind
which
swept
up
the
stream
this
style
of
rapid
was
more
to
our
fancy
these
were
good
rapids
the
best
we
had
seen
there
were
few
rocks
to
avoid
some
of
the
rapids
were
violent
but
careful
handling
took
us
past
every
danger
there
was
little
chance
to
make
a
portage
at
several
of
these
places
had
we
desired
to
do
so
we
gave
them
but
a
glance
from
the
decks
of
the
boats
then
dropped
into
them
in
one
instance
i
saw
the
literally
shoot
through
a
wave
bow
first
both
ends
of
the
boat
being
visible
while
her
captain
was
buried
in
the
foam
we
had
learned
to
discriminate
by
its
noise
long
before
we
could
see
a
rapid
whether
it
was
filled
with
rocks
or
was
merely
a
descent
of
big
water
the
latter
often
just
as
impressive
as
the
former
had
a
sullen
steady
boom
the
rocky
rapids
had
the
same
sound
punctuated
by
another
sound
like
the
crack
of
regiments
of
musketry
all
were
greatly
magnified
in
sound
by
the
narrow
echoing
walls
we
became
so
accustomed
to
this
noise
that
we
almost
forgot
it
was
there
and
it
was
only
after
the
long
quiet
stretches
that
the
noise
was
noticed
in
a
few
instances
only
we
noticed
the
shattering
vibration
of
air
that
is
associated
with
waterfalls
still
there
is
noise
enough
in
many
rapids
so
that
their
boom
can
be
heard
several
miles
away
from
the
top
of
the
canyons
guided
by
these
sounds
and
aided
by
our
method
of
holding
the
boat
in
while
making
a
reconnaissance
we
were
quite
well
aware
of
what
we
were
likely
to
find
before
we
anchored
above
a
rapid
we
were
never
fearful
of
being
drawn
into
a
cataract
without
having
a
chance
to
land
somewhere
the
water
is
strangely
quiet
to
a
comparatively
close
distance
above
nearly
all
rapids
we
usually
tied
up
anywhere
from
fifty
feet
to
a
hundred
yards
above
a
drop
before
inspecting
it
if
it
was
a
rapid
we
usually
looked
it
over
standing
on
the
seat
in
the
boats
then
continued
by
signals
with
the
hands
the
one
first
over
would
guide
the
other
if
any
hidden
rocks
or
dangerous
channel
threatened
while
we
did
not
think
much
about
it
we
usually
noted
the
places
where
one
might
climb
out
on
the
plateau
little
could
be
told
about
the
upper
walls
from
the
river
a
chilling
wind
swept
up
the
river
penetrating
our
soaked
garments
but
we
paid
little
attention
to
this
only
pulling
the
harder
not
only
to
keep
the
circulation
going
but
every
pull
of
the
oars
put
us
that
much
nearer
home
we
never
paused
in
our
rowing
until
we
anchored
at
under
rust
tramway
close
to
the
mouth
of
bright
angel
creek
according
to
the
united
states
geological
survey
there
is
a
descent
of
feet
from
the
head
of
the
hance
rapid
to
the
end
of
bright
angel
trail
one
mile
below
the
creek
we
would
have
a
very
moderate
descent
in
that
mile
the
run
from
the
hance
rapid
had
been
made
in
less
than
five
hours
our
boats
were
tied
in
the
shadow
of
the
cage
hanging
from
a
cable
sixty
feet
above
it
stretched
across
a
quiet
pool
feet
across
for
the
river
is
dammed
by
débris
from
the
creek
below
and
fills
the
channel
from
wall
to
wall
hurriedly
we
made
our
way
up
to
rust
camp
closed
for
the
winter
for
heavy
snows
would
cover
the
north
rim
in
a
few
days
or
a
few
weeks
at
the
farthest
filling
the
trails
with
heavy
drifts
and
driving
the
cougar
into
the
canyon
where
dogs
and
horses
can
not
follow
but
the
was
out
for
us
we
knew
had
we
cared
to
use
the
tents
our
signal
fire
was
built
a
mile
above
the
camp
at
a
spot
that
was
plainly
visible
on
a
clear
day
from
our
home
on
the
other
side
six
miles
away
as
the
crow
flies
we
had
often
looked
at
this
spot
with
a
telescope
from
the
veranda
of
our
studio
watching
the
hunting
and
parties
ride
up
the
bed
of
the
stream
we
rather
feared
the
drifting
clouds
and
mists
would
hide
the
fire
from
view
but
now
and
then
a
rift
appeared
and
we
knew
if
they
were
looking
they
could
see
its
light
camp
no
was
made
close
to
bright
angel
creek
that
evening
thursday
october
the
two
months
and
eight
days
from
the
time
we
had
embarked
on
our
journey
three
or
four
hours
were
spent
in
packing
our
material
the
next
morning
so
it
could
be
stored
in
a
miners
tunnel
near
the
end
of
the
trail
we
would
pack
little
of
this
out
as
we
intended
to
resume
our
river
work
in
a
week
or
ten
days
a
run
took
us
over
the
rapid
below
bright
angel
creek
and
down
to
a
bend
in
the
river
just
above
the
cameron
or
bright
angel
trail
two
men
guides
from
the
hotel
called
to
us
as
our
boats
swept
into
view
we
made
a
quick
dash
over
the
vicious
little
drop
below
the
bend
easy
for
our
boats
but
dangerous
enough
for
lighter
craft
on
account
of
a
difficult
whirlpool
and
were
soon
on
shore
greeting
old
friends
up
on
the
plateau
feet
above
a
trail
party
of
tourists
and
guides
called
down
their
welcome
the
stores
were
put
in
the
miners
tunnel
as
we
had
planned
and
the
boats
were
taken
above
the
mark
placed
in
dry
dock
one
might
say
the
guides
had
good
news
for
us
and
bad
news
too
emery
wife
had
been
ill
with
appendicitis
nearly
all
the
time
we
were
on
our
journey
we
had
received
letters
from
her
at
every
excepting
ferry
but
never
a
hint
that
all
was
not
well
she
knew
it
would
break
up
the
trip
pretty
good
nerve
we
thought
ragged
and
weary
but
happy
a
little
lean
and
but
feeling
entirely
fit
we
commenced
our
climb
up
the
trail
every
turn
of
which
seemed
like
an
old
friend
when
feet
above
the
river
our
little
workshop
beside
a
stream
on
the
plateau
only
used
at
intervals
when
no
water
can
be
had
on
top
and
closed
for
three
months
past
gave
us
our
first
cheerless
greeting
although
little
more
than
a
hundred
feet
from
the
trail
we
did
not
stop
to
inspect
it
cameron
indian
garden
camp
was
also
closed
for
the
day
and
we
were
disappointed
in
a
hope
that
we
could
telephone
to
our
home
feet
above
but
the
tents
under
rows
of
waving
cottonwoods
and
surrounded
by
beds
of
blooming
roses
and
glorious
chrysanthemums
gave
us
a
more
cheerful
welcome
than
our
little
building
below
we
only
stopped
to
quench
our
thirst
in
the
bubbling
spring
then
began
the
climb
that
would
put
us
on
top
of
the
towering
cliff
soon
we
overtook
the
party
we
had
seen
on
the
plateau
some
of
the
tourists
kindly
offered
us
their
mules
but
mules
were
too
slow
for
us
and
they
were
soon
far
below
us
calls
faint
at
first
but
growing
louder
as
we
advanced
came
floating
down
from
above
on
nearing
the
top
our
younger
brother
ernest
who
had
come
on
from
pittsburg
to
look
after
our
business
came
running
down
the
trail
to
greet
us
one
member
of
a
troupe
of
actors
in
cowboy
garb
remarked
that
we
did
look
like
explorers
then
little
edith
emerged
from
our
studio
just
below
the
head
of
bright
angel
trail
and
came
skipping
down
toward
us
but
stopped
suddenly
when
near
us
and
said
smilingly
is

daddy

all
those
whiskers
chapter
xx
one
month
later
naturally
we
were
very
impatient
to
know
just
what
success
we
had
met
with
in
our
photographic
work
some
of
the
motion
pictures
had
been
printed
and
returned
to
us
my
brother
who
meanwhile
had
taken
his
family
to
los
angeles
sent
very
encouraging
reports
regarding
some
of
the
films
among
the
canyon
visitors
who
came
down
to
inspect
the
results
of
our
trip
were
thomas
moran
the
famous
artist
with
his
daughter
miss

whose
interest
was
more

name
more
than
any
other
with
the
possible
exception
of
major
powell
is
to
be
associated
with
the
grand
canyon
it
was
his
painting
which
hangs
in
the
capital
at
washington
that
first
acquainted
the
american
public
with
the
wonders
of
the
canyon
this
painting
was
the
result
of
a
journey
he
made
with
major
powell
from
salt
lake
city
to
the
north
side
of
the
canyon
years
before
in
addition
he
had
made
most
of
the
cuts
that
illustrated
major
powell
government
report
making
his
sketches
on
wood
from
photographs
this
expedition
had
taken
with
the
wet
plates
that
had
to
be
coated
and
developed
on
the
spot
wonderful
photographs
which
for
beauty
softness
and
detail
are
not
excelled
and
are
scarcely
equalled
by
more
modern
plates
and
photographic
results
the
only
great
advantage
of
the
dry
plates
was
the
fact
that
they
could
catch
the
action
of
the
water
with
an
instantaneous
exposure
where
the
wet
plates
had
to
have
a
long
exposure
and
lost
that
action
thomas
moran
could
pick
up
almost
any
picture
that
we
made
and
tell
us
at
once
just
what
section
it
came
from
and
its
identifying
characteristics
his
daughter
miss
ruth
was
just
as
much
interested
in
our
trip
and
its
results
she
was
anxious
to
know
when
we
would
go
on
again
and
planned
on
making
the
trail
trip
down
to
the
plateau
to
see
us
take
the
plunge
over
the
first
rough
rapid
she
was
just
a
little
anxious
to
see
an
upset
and
asked
if
we
could
not
promise
that
one
would
occur
a
month
passed
before
my
brother
returned
from
los
angeles
his
wife
who
had
remained
there
was
in
good
health
again
and
insisted
on
his
finishing
the
trip
at
once
we
were
just
as
anxious
to
have
it
finished
but
were
not
very
enthusiastic
about
this
last
part
on
account
of
some
very
cold
weather
we
had
been
having
on
the
other
hand
we
feared
if
the
trip
was
not
finished
then
it
might
never
be
completed
so
we
consoled
ourselves
with
the
thought
that
it
was
some
warmer
at
the
bottom
than
it
was
on
top
and
prepared
to
make
the
final
plunge
miles
to
needles
with
a
descent
in
the
miles
that
remained
of
the
grand
canyon
a
foot
of
snow
had
fallen
two
nights
before
we
planned
on
leaving
the
thermometer
had
dropped
to
zero
and
a
little
below
on
one
occasion
during
the
nights
for
a
week
past
close
to
the
top
the
trail
was
filled
with
drifts
the
walls
were
white
with
snow
down
to
the
plateau
feet
below
something
unusual
as
it
seldom
descends
as
snow
lower
than
two
thousand
feet
but
turns
to
rain
but
a
week
of
cold
cloudy
weather
accompanied
by
hard
winds
had
driven
all
warmth
from
the
canyon
allowing
this
snow
to
descend
lower
than
usual
under
such
conditions
the
damp
cold
in
the
canyon
while
not
registered
on
the
thermometer
as
low
as
that
on
top
is
more
penetrating
very
little
sun
reaches
the
bottom
of
the
inner
gorge
in
december
and
january
it
is
usually
a
few
degrees
colder
than
the
inner
plateau
above
it
which
is
open
and
does
get
some
sun
these
were
the
conditions
when
we
returned
to
our
boats
december
the
and
found
a
thin
covering
of
ice
on
small
pools
near
the
river
our
party
was
enlarged
by
the
addition
of
two
men
who
were
anxious
for
some
river
experience
one
was
our
younger
brother
ernest
we
agreed
to
take
him
as
far
as
the
bass
trail
miles
below
where
he
could
get
out
on
top
and
return
to
our
home
the
other
was
a
young
man
named
bert
lauzon
who
wanted
to
make
the
entire
trip
and
we
were
glad
to
have
him
lauzon
although
but
years
old
had
been
a
quartz
miner
and
mining
engineer
for
some
years
coming
from
the
mountains
of
colorado
he
had
travelled
over
most
of
the
western
states
and
a
considerable
part
of
mexico
in
his
expeditions
there
was
no
question
in
our
minds
about
lauzon
he
was
the
man
we
needed
to
offset
the
weight
of
an
extra
man
for
each
boat
our
supplies
were
cut
to
the
minimum
arrangements
having
been
made
with
bass
the
proprietor
of
the
bass
camps
and
of
the
mystic
springs
trail
to
have
some
provisions
packed
in
over
his
trail
what
provisions
we
took
ourselves
were
packed
down
on
two
mules
and
anything
we
could
spare
from
our
boats
was
packed
out
on
the
same
animals
as
we
were
about
ready
to
leave
a
friendly
miner
said
you
ca
hook
fish
in
the
colorado
in
the
winter
they
wo
bite
nohow
you
better
take
a
couple
of
sticks
of
my
along
that
will
help
you
get
and
it
may
keep
you
from
starving
under
the
circumstances
it
seemed
like
a
wise
precaution
and
we
took
his
as
he
had
suggested
the
river
had
fallen
two
feet
below
the
stage
on
which
we
quit
a
month
before
a
scale
of
on
a
rock
wall
rising
from
the
river
showed
that
the
water
feet
deep
at
that
spot
no
measurement
was
made
in
the
middle
of
the
river
channel
the
current
here
between
two
small
rapids
flows
at
five
and
miles
per
hour
the
width
of
the
stream
is
close
to
feet
the
mark
here
is
feet
above
the
stage
then
the
river
spreads
to
five
hundred
feet
in
width
running
with
a
swiftness
and
strength
of
current
and
whirlpool
that
is
tremendous
the
highest
authentic
measurement
in
a
narrow
channel
of
which
we
know
is
one
made
by
julius
stone
in
marble
canyon
he
recorded
one
spot
where
the
mark
was
feet
above
the
mark
these
figures
might
look
large
at
first
but
if
they
are
compared
with
some
of
the
floods
on
the
ohio
river
for
instance
and
that
stream
were
boxed
in
a
two
hundred
foot
channel
the
difference
would
not
be
great
we
imagine
one
of
the
young
men
who
greeted
us
when
we
landed
came
down
with
a
companion
to
see
us
embark
on
the
plateau
feet
above
looking
like
small
insects
against
the
was
a
trail
party
equally
interested
they
did
not
stand
on
the
point
usually
visited
by
such
parties
but
had
gone
to
a
point
about
a
mile
to
the
west
where
they
had
a
good
view
of
a
short
rough
rapid
the
little
rapid
below
the
trail
while
it
was
no
place
that
one
would
care
to
swim
in
had
no
comparison
with
this
other
rapid
in
violence
we
had
promised
the
party
that
we
would
run
this
rapid
that
afternoon
so
we
spent
little
time
in
packing
systematically
but
hurriedly
threw
the
stuff
in
and
embarked
less
than
an
hour
later
we
had
made
the
run
and
the
dash
through
the
short
rapid
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
all
concerned
we
camped
a
short
distance
below
the
rapid
just
opposite
a
grave
of
a
man
whose
skeleton
had
been
found
halfway
up
the
granite
five
years
before
judging
by
his
clothes
and
shoes
he
was
a
prospector
he
was
lying
in
a
natural
position
with
his
head
resting
on
a
rock
an
overcoat
was
buttoned
tightly
about
him
no
large
bones
were
broken
but
he
might
have
had
a
fall
and
been
injured
internally
more
likely
he
became
sick
and
died
the
small
bones
of
the
hands
and
feet
had
been
taken
away
by
and
no
doubt
the
had
stripped
the
flesh
his
pockets
contained
los
angeles
newspapers
of
he
was
found
in
the
pockets
also
contained
a
pipe
and
a
but
nothing
by
which
he
could
be
identified
the
coroner
jury
of
which
my
brother
was
a
member
buried
him
where
he
was
found
covering
the
body
with
rocks
for
there
was
no
earth
such
finds
are
not
unusual
in
this
rugged
country
these
prospectors
seldom
say
where
they
are
going
no
track
is
kept
of
their
movements
and
unless
something
about
their
clothes
tells
who
they
are
their
identity
is
seldom
established
the
proximity
of
this
grave
made
us
wonder
how
many
more
such
unburied
bodies
there
were
along
this
river
we
thought
too
of
our
friend
smith
back
in
cataract
canyon
and
wondered
if
we
would
hear
from
him
again
our
helpers
got
a
lot
of
experience
in
making
the
next
day
while
we
ran
our
boats
through
a
number
of
good
strong
rapids
well
known
locally
as
the
salt
creek
rapid
granite
falls
or
monument
rapid
the
hermit
the
bouchere
and
others
this
was
all
new
to
the
boys
and
provided
some
thrilling
entertainment
for
them
when
a
difficult
passage
was
safely
made
bert
would
wave
his
hat
and
yell
hoo
in
a
deep
long
call
that
would
carry
above
the
roar
of
the
rapids
then
he
and
ernest
would
follow
along
the
shore
with
their
cameras
as
these
rapids
all
had
a
shore
on
one
side
or
the
other
the
sun
shone
on
the
river
this
day
and
we
congratulated
ourselves
on
having
made
the
most
of
our
opportunities
in
our
first
rapid
the
next
morning
we
had
to
carry
our
passengers
whether
we
wanted
to
or
not
there
was
no
shore
on
either
side
in
such
plunges
they
would
lie
down
on
the
deck
of
the
boat
behind
the
oarsman
holding
to
the
raised
bulkhead
ducking
their
heads
when
an
oncoming
wave
prepared
to
break
over
them
then
they
would
shake
themselves
as
a
does
and
bert
with
a
grin
would
say
young
fellows
business
is
picking
up
ernest
agreed
too
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
in
pittsburg
that
quite
equalled
it
if
the
rapid
was
not
bad
they
sat
upright
on
the
deck
but
this
made
the
boats
and
as
much
of
the
work
depended
on
swinging
his
weight
from
side
to
side
it
was
important
that
no
mistake
should
be
made
about
this
distribution
of
weight
often
the
bottom
of
a
boat
would
show
above
the
water
as
it
listed
to
one
side
at
such
a
time
a
person
sitting
on
the
raised
deck
might
get
thrown
overboard
before
starting
on
this
last
trip
we
had
thought
it
would
be
only
right
to
give
our
younger
brother
a
ride
in
a
rapid
that
would
be
sure
to
give
him
a
good
ducking
as
his
experience
was
going
to
be
short
but
the
water
and
the
wind
especially
in
the
shadows
was
so
very
cold
that
we
gave
this
plan
up
and
avoided
the
waves
as
much
as
possible
he
got
a
ducking
this
morning
however
in
a
place
where
we
least
expected
it
it
was
not
a
rapid
just
smooth
very
swift
water
while
close
to
the
right
shore
there
was
one
submerged
rock
with
a
foot
of
water
shooting
over
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
made
a
reverse
whirl
as
they
are
called
in
alaska
water
rolling
back
upstream
and
from
all
sides
as
well
to
fill
the
vacuum
just
below
the
rock
this
one
was
about
twelve
feet
across
the
water
disappeared
as
though
it
was
being
poured
down
a
manhole
the
least
care
or
caution
would
have
taken
me
clear
this
place
but
the
smooth
water
was
so
deceptive
and
was
so
much
stronger
than
i
had
judged
it
to
be
that
i
found
myself
caught
sideways
to
the
current
hemmed
in
with
waves
on
all
sides
of
the
boat
knocked
back
and
forth
and
resisted
in
all
my
efforts
to
pull
clear
the
boat
was
gradually
filling
with
the
splashing
water
ernest
was
lying
on
the
deck
hanging
on
like
grim
death
slipping
off
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
and
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
so
was
i
to
be
held
up
in
the
middle
of
a
swift
stream
was
a
new
experience
and
i
was
not
proud
of
it
the
others
passed
as
soon
as
they
saw
what
had
happened
and
were
waiting
in
an
eddy
below
perhaps
we
were
there
only
one
minute
but
it
seemed
like
five
i
helped
ernest
into
the
cockpit
about
that
time
the
boat
filled
with
splashing
water
and
sunk
low
the
stream
poured
over
the
rock
and
into
the
boat
and
she
upset
instantly
ernest
had
on
two
and
came
up
about
thirty
feet
below
swimming
very
well
considering
that
he
was
weighted
with
heavy
clothes
and
shoes
the
boys
pulled
him
in
before
he
was
carried
against
a
threatening
wall
meanwhile
i
held
to
the
boat
which
was
forced
out
as
soon
as
she
was
overturned
and
climbed
on
top
or
rather
on
the
bottom
i
was
trying
to
make
the
best
of
things
and
was
giving
a
cheer
when
some
one
said
there
goes
your
hatch
cover
and
you
lost
the
camera
perhaps
i
had
my
cheering
ceased
the
camera
had
been
hurriedly
shoved
down
in
the
hatch
a
few
minutes
before
on
being
towed
to
shore
however
we
found
the
camera
had
not
fallen
out
it
had
been
shoved
to
the
side
less
than
one
inch
but
that
little
bit
had
saved
it
it
was
filled
with
water
though
and
all
the
pictures
were
on
the
unfinished
roll
in
the
camera
and
were
ruined
we
had
been
in
the
water
long
enough
to
lose
that
glow
which
comes
after
a
quick
immersion
and
were
chilled
through
but
what
bothered
me
more
than
anything
else
was
the
fact
that
i
had
been
caught
in
such
a
trap
after
successfully
running
the
bad
rapids
above
we
made
a
short
run
after
that
so
as
to
get
out
of
sight
of
the
deceptive
place
then
proceeded
to
dry
out
the
ruined
film
came
in
handy
for
kindling
our
we
were
now
in
the
narrowest
part
of
the
upper
portion
of
the
grand
canyon
the
distance
from
rim
to
rim
at
one
point
being
close
to
six
miles
the
width
at
bright
angel
varied
from
eight
to
fourteen
miles
the
peaks
rising
from
the
plateau
often
as
high
as
the
canyon
walls
and
with
flat
tops
a
mile
or
more
in
width
made
the
canyon
even
narrower
so
that
at
times
we
were
in
canyons
close
to
a
mile
in
depth
and
little
over
four
miles
across
at
the
tops
in
this
section
of
the
granite
there
were
few
places
where
one
could
climb
out
nearly
all
the
lateral
canyons
ended
quite
a
distance
above
the
river
then
fell
sheer
the
lower
parts
of
the
walls
were
quite
often
where
they
were
polished
by
the
sands
in
the
stream
the
black
granite
in
such
cases
resembled
huge
deposits
of
anthracite
coal
sections
of
the
granite
often
projected
out
of
the
water
as
islands
with
the
softer
rock
washed
away
the
granite
being
curiously
carved
by
whirling
rocks
and
the
sands
holes
three
and
four
feet
deep
were
worn
by
small
whirling
rocks
and
grooves
were
worn
at
one
place
by
growing
willows
working
back
and
forth
in
the
water
the
sand
strange
to
say
having
less
effect
on
the
limbs
than
it
had
on
the
hard
rocks
about
noon
of
the
day
following
this
upset
we
reached
the
end
of
the
bass
trail
and
another
cable
crossing
about
sixty
feet
above
the
water
three
men
were
waiting
for
us
and
gave
a
call
when
we
rowed
in
sight
of
their
camp
one
was
lauzon
brother
another
was
cecil
dodd
a
cowboy
who
looked
after
bass
stock
and
the
breaking
of
his
horses
the
third
was
john
norberg
an
old
timer
and
an
old
friend
as
well
engaged
at
that
time
in
working
some
asbestos
and
copper
claims
the
granite
was
broken
down
at
this
point
and
another
small
deposit
of
algonkian
was
found
here
there
were
intrusions
faults
and
displacements
both
in
these
formations
and
in
the
layers
above
these
fractures
exposed
mineral
seams
and
deposits
of
copper
and
asbestos
on
both
sides
of
the
river
some
of
which
bass
had
opened
up
and
located
waiting
for
the
day
when
there
would
be
better
transportation
facilities
than
his
burros
afforded
this
was
not
our
first
visit
to
this
section
on
other
occasions
we
had
descended
by
the
mystic
spring
or
bass
trail
on
the
south
side
crossed
on
the
tramway
and
were
taken
by
bass
over
some
of
his
many
trails
on
the
north
side
we
had
visited
the
asbestos
claims
where
the
edge
of
a
blanket
formation
of
the
rock
known
as
serpentine
containing
the
asbestos
lay
exposed
to
view
twisting
around
the
head
of
narrow
canyons
and
under
beetling
cliffs
we
went
halfway
up
the
north
rim
trail
through
shinumo
and
white
canyons
our
objective
point
on
these
trips
being
a
narrow
box
canyon
which
contained
a
large
boulder
rolled
from
the
walls
above
and
wedged
in
the
gorge
far
above
our
heads
this
trail
continues
up
to
the
top
going
over
the
narrow
neck
which
connects
powell
plateau
a
segregated
section
of
thickly
wooded
surface
several
miles
in
extent
with
the
main
extent
of
the
kaibab
plateau
ernest
though
slightly
affected
with
tonsillitis
was
loath
to
leave
us
here
it
was
zero
weather
on
top
we
were
told
and
it
looked
it
the
walls
and
peaks
were
white
with
snow
he
would
not
have
an
easy
trip
the
drifted
snow
was
only
broken
by
the
one
party
that
we
found
at
the
river
and
quite
likely
it
would
be
very
late
when
he
arrived
at
the
ranch
john
went
up
with
him
a
few
miles
to
get
a
horse
for
the
ride
home
the
next
day
ernest
took
with
him
a
few
hurriedly
written
letters
and
the
exposed
plates
the
film
we
were
going
to
save
was
lost
in
the
upset
on
inspecting
the
provisions
which
were
packed
in
here
we
found
the
grocers
had
shipped
the
order
short
omitting
besides
other
necessities
some
canned
baked
beans
on
which
we
depended
a
great
deal
this
meant
one
of
two
things
we
would
have
to
make
a
quicker
run
than
we
had
planned
on
or
would
have
to
get
out
of
the
canyon
at
one
of
the
two
places
where
such
an
exit
could
easily
be
made
the
as
our
camera
was
called
and
which
was
but
not
abbreviated
by
bert
as
the
member
of
parliament
had
to
be
cleaned
before
we
could
proceed
it
took
all
this
day
and
much
of
the
next
to
get
the
moisture
and
sand
out
of
the
delicate
mechanism
and
have
it
running
smoothly
again
after
it
was
once
more
in
good
condition
emery
announced
that
he
wanted
to
work
out
a
few
scenes
of
an
uncompleted
the
action
was
snappy
the
plot
was
brief
but
harmonized
well
with
the
setting
and
the
props
dodd
who
was
a
big
texan
was
cast
for
the
role
of
horse
thief
and
bad
man
in
general
bert
brother
morris
lauzon
was
the
deputy
sheriff
and
had
a
star
cut
from
the
top
of
a
tomato
can
to
prove
it
john
was
to
be
a
prospector
he
would
need
little
rehearsing
for
this
part
in
addition
he
had
not
been
out
where
he
could
have
the
services
of
a
barber
for
six
months
past
which
was
all
the
better
john
had
a
kind
quiet
way
that
made
friends
for
him
on
sight
he
was
not
consulted
about
the
part
he
was
to
play
but
we
counted
on
his
good
nature
and
he
was
cast
for
the
part
emery
who
was
cast
for
the
part
of
a
mining
engineer
arrived
on
the
scene
in
his
boat
after
rounding
the
bend
above
the
camp
tied
up
and
climbed
out
over
the
cliffs
to
view
the
surrounding
country
the
hidden
desperado
knowing
that
he
was
being
hunted
stole
the
boat
with
its
contents
and
made
his
escape
the
returning
engineer
arrived
just
in
time
to
see
his
boat
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
and
a
levelled
rifle
halted
him
until
the
boat
was
hidden
around
the
bend
at
that
moment
the
officer
joined
him
and
a
hurried
consultation
was
held
then
the
other
boat
which
had
been
separated
from
its
companion
pulled
into
sight
and
i
was
hailed
by
the
men
on
shore
they
came
aboard
and
we
gave
chase
could
anything
be
better
the
thief
naturally
thought
he
was
safe
as
he
had
not
seen
the
second
boat
after
going
over
a
few
rapids
he
saw
a
fire
up
in
the
cliffs
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
he
landed
and
climbed
up
to
the
camp
where
john
was
at
work
john
shared
his
camp
fare
with
him
and
directed
him
to
a
hidden
trail
the
pursuers
on
finding
the
abandoned
boat
quietly
followed
the
trail
and
surprised
dodd
in
john
camp
he
was
disarmed
and
sent
across
the
river
in
the
tramway
accompanied
by
the
deputy
and
was
punished
as
he
richly
deserved
to
be
this
was
the
scenario
bert
handled
the
camera
emery
was
the
playwright
director
and
producer
all
rights
reserved
everything
worked
beautifully
the
film
did
not
get
balled
up
in
the
cogs
as
sometimes
happened
the
light
was
good
belasco
himself
could
not
have
improved
on
the
the
trail
led
over
the
wildest
and
most
picturesque
places
imaginable
dodd
made
a
splendid
desperado
and
acted
as
if
he
had
done
nothing
but
steal
horses
and
dodge
the
officers
all
his
life
a
pile
of
driftwood
fifty
feet
high
and
with
a
tunnel
underneath
made
a
splendid
hiding
place
for
him
while
the
first
boat
was
being
tied
being
a
cowpuncher
it
may
be
that
he
did
not
handle
the
oars
as
well
as
an
experienced
riverman
but
any
rapid
could
be
used
for
an
insert
the
deputy
though
youthful
was
determined
and
never
lost
sight
of
the
trail
the
engineer
acted
his
part
well
and
registered
surprise
and
anger
when
he
found
how
he
had
been
tricked
john
who
had
returned
humoured
us
and
dug
nuggets
of
gold
out
of
limestone
rocks
where
no
one
would
have
thought
of
looking
for
them
the
fact
that
the
tramway
scene
was
made
before
any
of
the
others
did
not
matter
we
could
play
our
last
act
first
if
we
wanted
to
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
cut
the
film
and
fasten
it
on
to
the
end
emery
was
justly
proud
of
his
first
efforts
as
a
producer
we
were
sorry
this
film
had
not
been
sent
out
with
ernest
this
thrilling
drama
will
not
be
released
in
the
near
future
one
day
later
we
found
that
a
drop
of
water
had
worked
into
the
lens
cell
at
the
last
upset
this
fogged
the
lens
we
focussed
with
a
scale
and
had
overlooked
the
lens
when
cleaning
the
camera
nothing
but
a
very
faint
outline
showed
on
the
film
we
had
all
the
film
we
needed
for
a
week
after
this
for
kindling
our
fires
chapter
xxi
what
christmas
eve
brought
in
recording
our
various
mishaps
and
upsets
in
these
pages
it
may
seem
to
the
reader
as
if
i
have
given
undue
prominence
to
the
part
i
took
in
them
if
so
it
has
not
been
from
choice
but
because
they
happened
in
that
way
no
doubt
a
great
deal
of
my
trouble
was
due
to
carelessness
after
i
had
learned
to
row
my
boat
fairly
well
i
sometimes
took
chances
that
proved
to
be
anything
but
advisable
depending
a
good
deal
on
luck
and
luck
was
not
always
with
me
my
brother
was
less
hasty
in
making
his
decisions
and
was
more
careful
in
his
movements
with
the
result
that
his
boat
had
few
marks
of
any
kind
and
he
had
been
more
fortunate
than
i
with
the
rapids
it
is
my
duty
to
record
another
adventure
at
this
point
in
which
we
all
three
shared
each
in
a
different
manner
this
time
i
am
going
to
give
my
brother
record
of
the
happenings
that
overtook
us
about
four
in
the
afternoon
of
december
the
less
than
three
hours
after
we
left
our
friends
at
the
bass
trail
with
best
wishes
for
a
merry
christmas
and
had
received
instructions
from
john
to
keep
our
feet
dry
my
brother
account
follows
the
fourth
rapid
below
the
bass
trail
was
bad
but
after
looking
it
over
we
decided
it
could
be
run
we
had
taken
chances
in
rapids
that
looked
worse
and
came
through
unharmed
if
we
were
successful
here
it
would
be
over
in
a
few
minutes
and
forgotten
an
hour
later
so
we
each
made
the
attempt
lauzon
had
gone
near
the
lower
end
of
the
rapid
taking
the
left
shore
for
a
wall
with
a
sloping
bench
on
top
rose
sheer
out
of
the
water
on
the
right
the
only
shore
on
the
right
was
close
to
the
head
of
the
rapid
a
small
deposit
or
bank
of
earth
and
rock
the
inner
gorge
here
was
about
nine
hundred
feet
deep
ellsworth
went
first
taking
the
side
i
picked
out
a
course
on
the
right
as
being
the
least
dangerous
but
i
was
scarcely
started
when
i
found
myself
on
a
nest
of
jagged
rocks
with
violent
water
all
about
me
and
with
other
rocks
some
of
them
submerged
below
me
i
climbed
out
on
the
rocks
and
held
the
boat
if
the
others
could
land
below
the
rapid
and
climb
back
they
might
get
a
rope
to
me
and
pull
me
off
the
rocks
far
enough
to
give
me
a
new
start
but
they
could
not
pull
the
boat
in
to
shore
through
the
rough
water
a
person
thinks
quickly
under
such
circumstances
i
had
it
all
figured
out
as
soon
as
i
was
on
the
rocks
the
greatest
trouble
would
be
to
hold
the
boat
if
she
broke
loose
then
i
saw
that
the
was
in
trouble
she
caught
in
a
reverse
whirl
in
the
very
middle
of
the
pounding
rapid
bouncing
back
and
forth
like
a
great
rubber
ball
finally
she
filled
with
the
splashing
water
sank
low
and
the
water
pouring
over
the
rock
caught
the
edge
of
the
pound
boat
and
turned
her
over
as
if
she
were
a
toy
my
brother
was
holding
to
the
gunwale
when
she
turned
still
she
was
held
in
the
whirl
jumping
as
violently
as
ever
then
turned
upright
again
and
was
forced
out
ellsworth
had
disappeared
but
came
up
nearly
a
hundred
feet
below
struggling
to
keep
on
top
but
going
down
with
every
breaking
wave
when
the
quieter
water
was
reached
he
did
not
seem
to
have
strength
enough
to
swim
out
but
floated
motionless
in
a
standing
position
his
head
kept
up
by
the
the
next
rapid
was
not
over
fifty
yards
below
if
he
was
to
be
saved
it
must
be
done
instantly
i
pried
the
boat
loose
jumped
in
as
she
swung
clear
and
pulled
with
all
my
might
headed
toward
the
centre
of
the
river
i
was
almost
clear
when
i
was
drawn
over
a
dip
bow
first
and
struck
a
glancing
blow
against
another
rock
i
had
never
seen
there
was
a
crash
and
the
boards
broke
like
it
was
all
done
in
a
few
moments
the
was
a
wreck
i
did
not
know
how
bad
my
brother
had
disappeared
lauzon
was
frantically
climbing
over
some
large
boulders
trying
to
reach
the
head
of
the
next
rapid
where
the
boat
was
held
in
an
eddy
my
boat
was
not
upset
but
the
waves
were
surging
through
a
great
hole
in
her
side
she
was
drawn
into
an
eddy
close
to
the
base
of
the
wall
where
i
could
tie
up
and
climb
out
it
seemed
folly
to
try
the
lower
end
with
my
filled
boat
climbing
to
the
top
of
the
rock
i
could
see
half
a
mile
down
the
canyon
but
my
brother
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
i
had
no
idea
that
he
had
escaped
i
was
returning
to
my
wrecked
boat
when
bert
waved
his
arms
and
pointed
to
the
head
of
the
rapid
going
back
once
more
i
saw
him
directly
below
me
at
the
base
of
the
sheer
rock
in
an
opening
where
the
wall
receded
he
had
crawled
out
twenty
feet
above
the
next
rapid
returning
to
my
wrecked
boat
i
was
soon
beside
him
he
was
exhausted
with
his
struggle
in
the
icy
waves
his
outer
garments
were
frozen
i
soon
procured
blankets
from
my
bed
removed
the
wet
clothes
and
wrapped
him
up
lauzon
true
to
our
expectations
of
what
he
would
do
when
the
test
came
swam
out
and
rescued
the
before
she
was
carried
over
the
next
rapid
he
was
inexperienced
at
the
oars
and
had
less
than
two
hours
practice
after
he
had
joined
us
it
was
a
tense
moment
when
he
started
across
above
the
rapid
but
he
made
it
landing
with
a
big
grin
he
exclaimed
fellows
business
is
picking
up
then
added
we
losing
lots
of
good
pictures
these
experiences
were
our
christmas
presents
that
year
they
were
not
done
up
in
small
packages
we
repaired
the
boat
on
christmas
day
three
smashed
side
ribs
were
replaced
with
mesquite
which
we
found
growing
on
the
walls
the
hole
was
patched
with
boards
from
the
loose
bottom
this
was
painted
canvas
was
tacked
over
that
and
painted
also
and
a
sheet
of
tin
or
galvanized
iron
went
over
it
all
this
completed
the
repair
and
the
was
as
seaworthy
as
before
this
is
emery
account
of
the
christmas
rapid
i
will
add
that
the
freezing
temperature
of
the
water
and
the
struggle
for
breath
in
the
breaking
waves
left
me
exhausted
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
river
an
eddy
drew
me
out
of
the
centre
of
the
stream
when
i
had
given
up
all
hope
of
any
escape
from
the
next
rapid
i
had
seen
my
brother
on
the
rock
below
the
head
of
the
rapid
and
knew
there
was
no
hope
from
him
as
i
was
being
drawn
back
into
the
current
close
to
the
end
of
the
sheer
wall
on
the
right
my
feet
struck
bottom
on
some
débris
washed
down
from
the
cliff
i
made
three
efforts
to
stand
but
fell
each
time
and
finally
crawled
out
on
my
hands
and
knees
i
had
the
peculiar
sensation
of
seeing
a
descending
before
my
eyes
although
i
knew
no
such
thing
existed
every
fibre
in
my
body
ached
and
continued
to
do
so
for
days
afterward
and
the
moment
i
would
close
my
eyes
to
sleep
i
would
see
mountainous
waves
about
me
and
would
feel
myself
being
whirled
head
over
heels
just
as
i
was
in
that
rapid
but
this
rapid
strange
to
say
while
exceedingly
rough
and
swift
did
not
contain
any
waves
that
we
would
have
considered
large
up
to
this
time
in
other
words
it
depended
on
the
circumstances
whether
it
was
bad
or
not
when
standing
on
the
shore
picking
a
channel
it
appeared
to
be
a
moderately
bad
rapid
in
which
a
person
aided
with
should
have
little
difficulty
in
keeping
on
top
at
least
half
the
time
after
my
battle
in
which
as
far
as
personal
effort
went
i
had
lost
and
after
my
providential
escape
that
one
rapid
appeared
to
be
the
largest
of
the
entire
series
it
is
difficult
to
describe
the
rapids
with
the
standard
and
give
an
idea
of
their
power
one
unfamiliar
with
white
water
usually
associates
a
descent
or
a
wave
with
a
similar
wave
on
the
ocean
there
is
no
comparison
the
waters
of
the
ocean
rise
and
fall
the
waves
travel
the
water
itself
except
in
breakers
is
comparatively
still
in
bad
rapids
the
water
is
whirled
through
at
the
rate
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
an
hour
in
some
cases
much
swifter
the
surface
is
broken
by
streams
shooting
up
from
every
submerged
rock
the
weight
of
the
river
is
behind
it
and
the
waves
instead
of
tumbling
forward
quite
as
often
break
upstream
such
waves
less
than
six
feet
high
are
often
dangers
to
be
shunned
after
being
overturned
in
them
we
learned
their
tremendous
power
a
power
we
would
never
have
associated
with
any
water
before
such
an
experience
short
of
a
waterfall
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
danger
in
the
canyons
plenty
of
it
still
in
most
cases
with
care
and
forethought
much
of
it
can
be
avoided
we
think
we
are
safe
in
saying
that
half
of
the
parties
who
have
attempted
a
passage
through
these
canyons
have
met
with
fatalities
most
of
these
have
occurred
in
cataract
canyon
not
because
it
is
any
worse
than
other
sections
certainly
no
worse
than
the
grand
canyon
but
because
it
is
easily
entered
from
the
quiet
alluring
water
of
the
lower
green
river
without
a
doubt
each
successful
expedition
is
responsible
in
a
way
for
others
attempts
in
nearly
every
instance
the
unfortunate
ones
have
underestimated
the
danger
and
have
attempted
the
passage
with
inadequate
boats
such
as
smith
had
for
instance
undecked
and
without
air
chambers
both
of
these
are
imperative
for
safety
we
had
the
benefit
of
the
experiences
of
others
in
addition
our
years
of
work
in
the
canyons
had
robbed
them
of
their
imaginary
dangers
and
while
we
trust
that
we
are
not
entirely
without
imagination
much
of
their
weirdness
and
glamour
with
which
they
are
inseparable
to
the
idealist
and
the
impressionist
each
of
these
upsets
could
have
been
avoided
by
a
portage
had
we
desired
to
make
one
but
success
in
other
rapids
made
us
a
little
reckless
and
ready
to
take
a
chance
beyond
getting
our
flour
wet
on
the
outside
we
suffered
very
little
loss
to
our
cargo
we
placed
the
two
flour
sacks
beside
the
fires
each
evening
until
the
wet
flour
dried
to
a
crust
we
continued
to
use
out
of
the
centre
of
the
sacks
as
though
nothing
had
ever
happened
bert
and
i
each
had
a
little
cough
the
next
morning
but
it
disappeared
by
noon
beyond
that
we
suffered
no
great
inconvenience
from
our
enforced
bath
sleeping
in
the
open
with
plenty
of
healthful
exercise
kept
us
physically
fit
the
cold
air
and
the
cold
water
did
not
seem
to
bother
the
others
but
i
could
not
get
comfortably
warm
during
this
cold
snap
added
to
this
it
took
me
some
time
to
get
over
my
scare
and
i
could
see
all
kinds
of
danger
in
rapids
where
emery
could
see
none
i
insisted
on
untying
the
photographic
cases
from
the
boats
and
carrying
them
around
a
number
of
rapids
before
we
ran
them
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
no
upset
occurred
in
these
rapids
then
came
a
cold
day
with
a
raw
wind
sweeping
up
the
river
a
coating
of
ice
covered
the
boats
and
the
oars
we
had
turned
directly
to
the
north
along
the
base
of
powell
plateau
and
were
nearing
the
end
of
a
second
granite
gorge
with
violent
rapids
and
jagged
rocks
emery
made
the
remark
that
he
had
not
had
a
swim
for
some
time
in
a
we
came
to
a
rapid
with
two
waves
in
the
centre
of
the
stream
with
a
projecting
point
above
that
would
have
to
be
passed
before
we
could
pull
out
of
the
centre
emery
got
his
swim
there
i
was
just
behind
and
was
more
fortunate
i
never
saw
anything
more
quickly
done
before
the
boat
was
fully
overturned
he
swung
an
oar
so
that
it
stuck
out
at
an
angle
from
the
side
of
the
boat
and
used
the
oar
for
a
step
an
instant
later
he
had
cut
the
oar
loose
and
steered
toward
the
shore
bert
threw
him
a
rope
from
the
shore
and
he
was
pulled
in
he
was
wearing
a
thin
rubber
coat
fitting
tightly
about
his
wrists
tied
about
his
neck
and
belted
at
the
waist
this
protected
him
so
thoroughly
that
he
was
only
wet
from
the
waist
down
if
we
were
a
little
inclined
to
be
proud
of
our
record
above
bright
angel
we
had
forgotten
all
about
it
by
this
time
we
were
scarcely
more
than
sixty
miles
from
home
and
had
experienced
three
upsets
and
a
smashed
boat
all
in
one
week
just
at
the
end
of
the
second
granite
section
we
made
our
first
portage
since
leaving
bright
angel
bert
and
i
worked
on
the
boats
while
emery
cooked
the
evening
meal
hot
rice
soup
flavoured
with
a
can
of
prepared
meat
was
easily
and
quickly
prepared
and
formed
one
of
the
usual
dishes
at
these
meals
it
contained
a
lot
of
nutriment
and
the
rice
took
up
but
little
space
in
the
boats
sometimes
the
meat
was
omitted
and
raisins
were
substituted
prepared
baked
beans
were
a
staple
dish
but
were
not
in
our
supply
on
this
last
part
of
the
trip
we
often
made
hot
cakes
twice
a
day
an
excuse
for
eating
a
great
deal
of
butter
and
honey
or
syrup
none
of
these
things
were
luxuries
they
were
the
best
foodstuff
we
could
carry
we
seemed
to
crave
sweet
stuff
and
used
quantities
of
sugar
we
could
carry
eggs
when
packed
in
sawdust
without
trouble
but
did
not
carry
many
we
had
little
meat
what
we
had
was
bacon
and
prepared
meats
of
the
lunch
variety
cheese
was
our
main
substitute
for
meat
it
was
easily
carried
and
kept
well
dried
peaches
or
apricots
were
on
the
bill
for
nearly
every
meal
each
allowance
being
cooked
the
evening
before
we
tried
several
condensed
or
emergency
foods
but
discarded
them
all
but
one
for
various
reasons
the
exception
was
erbeswurst
a
patent
dried
soup
preparation
other
prepared
soups
were
carried
also
i
must
not
forget
the
morning
cereal
it
was
cream
of
wheat
easily
prepared
eaten
not
served
perhaps
devoured
would
be
a
better
word
with
sugar
and
condensed
cream
as
long
as
it
lasted
then
with
butter
any
remainder
from
breakfast
was
fried
for
other
meals
each
evening
we
would
make
some
biscuit
in
a
a
dutch
oven
is
better
but
had
too
much
weight
the
appellation
for
such
bread
is
flapjack
or
when
i
did
the
baking
they
were
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
cocoa
which
was
nourishing
often
took
the
place
of
coffee
in
fact
our
systems
craved
just
what
was
most
needed
to
build
up
muscle
and
create
heat
we
found
it
was
useless
to
try
to
catch
fish
after
the
weather
became
cold
the
fish
would
not
bite
on
the
upper
end
of
our
journey
we
carried
no
tobacco
as
it
happened
that
jimmy
as
well
as
ourselves
were
not
tobacco
users
there
were
no
alcoholic
stimulants
when
bert
joined
us
a
small
flask
for
medicinal
purposes
only
was
taken
along
the
whiskey
was
scarcely
touched
at
this
time
bert
enjoyed
a
pipe
after
his
meals
but
continued
to
keep
even
when
his
tobacco
got
wet
so
tobacco
was
not
absolutely
necessary
to
him
uninteresting
and
unromantic
these
things
may
be
but
they
were
most
important
to
us
we
were
only
sorry
the
supply
was
not
larger
while
we
never
stinted
ourselves
or
cut
the
allowance
of
food
the
amount
was
growing
smaller
every
day
and
it
was
not
a
question
any
more
whether
we
would
go
out
or
not
to
get
provisions
to
rustle
as
bert
called
it
but
where
we
would
go
out
we
might
go
up
cataract
creek
or
ha
va
su
creek
as
it
is
sometimes
called
we
had
been
to
the
mouth
of
this
canyon
on
foot
so
there
would
be
no
danger
of
missing
it
the
ha
va
supai
indians
about
two
hundred
in
number
lived
in
this
lateral
canyon
about
seven
or
eight
miles
from
the
river
an
agent
and
a
farmer
lived
with
them
and
might
be
able
to
sell
us
some
provisions
if
not
it
would
be
fifty
miles
back
to
our
home
the
trail
was
much
more
direct
than
the
river
the
great
drawback
to
this
course
was
the
fact
that
ha
va
su
canyon
deep
and
narrow
contained
a
number
of
waterfalls
one
of
them
about
feet
high
the
precipice
over
which
it
fell
was
nothing
but
a
mineral
deposit
from
the
water
building
higher
every
year
formerly
this
was
impassable
until
some
miners
after
enlarging
a
sloping
cave
had
cut
a
winding
stairway
in
it
which
allowed
a
descent
to
be
made
to
the
bottom
of
the
fall
a
recent
storm
had
remodelled
all
the
falls
in
cataract
creek
canyon
cutting
out
the
travertine
in
some
places
piling
it
up
in
others
a
great
mass
of
cottonwood
trees
were
also
mixed
with
the
débris
the
village
too
had
been
washed
away
and
was
then
being
rebuilt
we
had
been
told
that
the
tunnel
was
filled
up
and
as
far
as
we
knew
no
one
had
been
to
the
river
since
the
flood
the
other
outlet
was
diamond
creek
canyon
much
farther
down
the
river
we
would
decide
when
we
got
to
ha
va
su
just
what
we
would
do
tapeets
creek
one
mile
below
our
camp
a
stream
which
has
masqueraded
under
the
title
of
thunder
river
and
about
which
there
has
been
considerable
speculation
proved
to
be
a
stream
a
little
smaller
than
bright
angel
creek
flowing
through
a
narrow
slot
in
the
rocks
and
did
not
fall
sheer
into
the
river
as
has
been
reported
perhaps
a
small
cascade
known
as
surprise
falls
which
we
passed
the
next
day
has
been
confused
with
tapeets
creek
this
stream
corkscrews
down
through
a
narrow
crevice
and
falls
about
two
hundred
feet
close
to
the
river
edge
we
are
told
that
the
upper
end
of
tapeets
creek
is
similar
to
this
but
on
a
much
larger
scale
just
opposite
this
fall
a
big
jumped
from
under
an
overhanging
ledge
close
to
the
water
and
stared
curiously
at
us
as
though
he
wondered
what
strange
things
those
were
coming
down
with
the
current
it
is
doubtful
if
he
ever
saw
a
human
being
before
this
sight
sent
us
scrambling
in
our
cases
for
cameras
and
firearms
and
it
was
not
the
game
laws
but
a
rusted
trigger
on
the
instead
that
saved
the
sheep
he
finally
took
alarm
and
scampered
away
over
the
rocks
and
we
had
no
mutton
stew
that
night
we
had
one
night
of
heavy
rain
and
morning
revealed
a
little
snow
within
three
hundred
feet
of
the
river
while
a
heavy
white
blanket
covered
the
upper
cliffs
it
continued
to
snow
on
top
and
rained
on
us
nearly
all
this
day
emery
took
this
opportunity
to
get
the
drop
of
moisture
out
of
the
lens
and
put
the
camera
in
such
shape
that
we
could
proceed
with
our
picture
making
a
short
run
was
made
after
this
work
was
completed
the
camp
we
were
just
leaving
was
about
three
miles
above
kanab
canyon
the
granite
was
behind
us
disappearing
with
a
steep
descent
much
as
it
had
emerged
at
the
hance
trail
there
was
also
a
small
deposit
of
algonkian
this
too
had
been
passed
and
we
were
back
in
the
limestone
and
sandstone
walls
similar
to
the
lower
end
of
marble
canyon
while
the
formations
were
the
same
the
canyon
differed
the
layers
were
thicker
the
red
sandstone
and
the
marble
walls
were
equally
sheer
there
was
no
plateau
between
what
plateau
this
canyon
contained
lay
on
top
of
the
red
sandstone
few
peaks
rose
above
this
the
canyon
had
completed
its
northern
run
and
was
turning
back
again
to
the
with
a
great
sweep
or
circle
less
than
an
hour
work
brought
us
to
kanab
canyon
chapter
xxii
short
of
provisions
in
a
sunless
gorge
in
the
mud
at
kanab
canyon
we
saw
an
old
footprint
of
some
person
who
had
come
down
to
the
river
through
this
narrow
gloomy
gorge
it
was
here
that
major
powell
terminated
his
second
voyage
on
account
of
extreme
high
water
a
picture
they
made
showed
their
boats
floated
up
in
this
side
canyon
our
stage
was
much
lower
than
this
dellenbaugh
the
author
of
a
canyon
voyage
was
a
member
of
this
second
expedition
this
book
had
been
our
guide
down
to
this
point
we
could
not
have
asked
for
a
better
one
below
here
we
had
a
general
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
river
and
had
a
set
of
the
government
maps
but
we
had
neglected
to
provide
ourselves
with
detailed
information
such
as
this
volume
gave
us
evening
of
the
following
day
found
us
at
cataract
creek
canyon
but
with
a
stage
of
water
in
the
river
nearly
fifty
feet
lower
than
that
which
we
had
seen
a
few
years
before
the
narrow
entrance
of
this
great
canyon
gives
no
hint
of
what
it
is
like
a
few
miles
above
the
indian
village
is
in
the
bottom
of
a
canyon
half
a
mile
wide
and
three
miles
long
covered
with
fertile
fields
peach
and
apricot
orchards
it
even
contained
a
few
fig
trees
below
the
village
the
canyon
narrowed
to
a
hundred
yards
with
a
level
bottom
covered
with
a
tangle
of
wild
grape
vines
cactus
and
cottonwood
trees
this
section
contained
the
two
largest
falls
and
came
to
an
end
about
four
miles
below
the
first
fall
then
the
canyon
narrowed
deep
and
gloomy
until
there
was
little
room
for
anything
but
the
powerful
rapidly
descending
stream
at
the
lower
end
it
was
often
waist
deep
and
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
wide
it
was
no
easy
task
to
go
through
this
gorge
the
stream
had
to
be
crossed
several
times
the
canyon
terminated
in
an
extremely
narrow
gorge
feet
deep
dark
and
gloomy
one
of
the
most
impressive
gorges
we
have
ever
seen
the
main
canyon
was
similar
with
a
few
breaks
on
the
sides
those
breaks
being
ledges
or
narrow
sloping
benches
that
would
extend
for
miles
only
to
be
brought
to
an
abrupt
end
by
side
canyons
there
are
many
in
this
section
but
we
saw
none
either
time
we
could
see
many
fresh
tracks
where
they
had
followed
these
ledges
around
and
had
gone
up
the
narrow
side
canyon
it
was
cold
in
the
main
canyon
and
no
doubt
the
sheep
could
be
found
on
the
plateaus
which
were
more
open
and
would
get
sun
when
the
sun
shone
this
plateau
was
feet
above
us
at
the
turn
of
the
canyon
we
could
see
the
other
walls
feet
above
that
the
rapids
in
the
section
just
passed
had
been
widely
separated
and
compared
well
with
those
of
marble
canyon
not
the
worst
we
had
seen
but
far
from
being
tame
there
was
plenty
of
shore
room
at
each
of
these
rapids
cactus
of
different
species
was
now
a
feature
of
the
scenery
the
ocotilla
or
candlewood
with
long
stalks
springing
from
a
common
centre
that
cactus
which
when
dried
needs
only
a
lighted
match
to
set
it
afire
flourishes
in
the
rocky
ledges
a
species
of
small
about
the
size
of
a
man
head
with
fluted
sides
or
symmetrical
vertical
rows
of
small
thorned
lumps
converging
at
the
top
of
the
as
they
are
sometimes
called
grows
in
great
numbers
in
crevices
on
the
walls
the
delicate
pin
cushion
gathered
in
clusters
of
myriad
small
spiny
balls
the
prickly
pear
here
in
ha
va
su
canyon
were
not
the
starved
shrivelled
cactus
such
as
we
found
at
the
beginning
of
our
trip
instead
they
were
green
and
flourishing
with
large
fleshy
leaves
joining
on
to
each
other
until
they
rise
to
a
height
of
three
feet
or
more
and
cover
large
patches
of
ground
to
the
utter
exclusion
of
all
other
growth
what
a
display
of
yellow
and
red
these
desert
plants
put
forth
when
they
are
in
bloom
a
previous
visit
to
ha
va
su
was
made
in
the
month
of
may
when
every
group
of
prickly
pear
was
a
riot
of
pure
colour
all
this
prolific
growth
is
made
possible
by
the
extreme
heat
of
the
summer
months
aided
in
the
case
of
those
plants
and
trees
which
flourish
in
the
fertile
soil
of
ha
va
su
by
the
and
the
spray
from
the
fall
after
making
an
inventory
of
our
provisions
we
concluded
not
to
try
the
tedious
and
uncertain
trip
up
cataract
creek
with
care
and
good
fortune
we
would
have
enough
provisions
to
last
us
to
diamond
creek
with
our
run
the
next
day
the
inner
gorge
continued
to
deepen
the
walls
drew
closer
together
so
that
we
now
had
a
narrow
gorge
hemming
us
in
with
walls
from
which
there
was
no
escape
they
were
about
a
fourth
of
a
mile
apart
at
the
top
a
boat
at
the
foot
of
one
of
these
walls
was
merely
an
atom
the
total
depth
of
the
canyon
was
close
to
feet
there
is
nothing
on
earth
to
which
this
gorge
can
be
compared
lowered
into
the
chasm
in
the
early
morning
the
sky
was
overcast
and
threatening
we
were
travelling
directly
west
again
and
no
sunlight
entered
here
even
when
the
sun
shone
the
walls
had
lost
their
brighter
reds
and
what
colour
they
had
was
dark
and
sombre
a
dirty
brown
and
dark
green
predominating
the
mythology
of
the
ancients
with
their
inferno
and
their
river
styx
could
hardly
conjure
anything
more
supernatural
or
impressive
than
this
gloomy
gorge
there
were
a
few
bad
rapids
one
or
two
had
no
shore
others
had
an
inclination
to
run
under
one
wall
and
had
to
be
run
very
carefully
if
we
could
not
get
down
alongside
of
a
rapid
we
could
usually
climb
out
on
the
walls
at
the
head
of
the
rapid
and
look
it
over
from
that
vantage
point
the
one
who
climbed
out
would
signal
directions
to
the
others
who
would
run
it
at
once
and
continue
on
to
the
next
rapid
they
would
have
its
course
figured
out
when
the
last
boat
arrived
one
canyon
entered
from
the
left
level
on
the
bottom
and
about
one
hundred
feet
wide
it
might
be
a
means
of
outlet
from
this
canyon
but
it
is
doubtful
for
the
marble
has
a
way
of
ending
abruptly
and
dropping
sheer
with
a
polished
surface
that
is
impossible
to
climb
new
year
eve
was
spent
in
this
section
the
camp
was
exceptionally
good
a
oblong
section
of
rock
about
fifty
feet
long
had
fallen
forward
from
the
base
of
the
cliff
this
left
a
opening
which
was
closed
at
one
end
with
our
tent
high
water
had
placed
a
sandy
floor
now
thoroughly
dry
in
the
bottom
under
the
circumstances
we
could
hardly
ask
for
anything
better
of
driftwood
there
was
none
and
our
were
made
of
mesquite
which
grew
in
ledges
in
the
rocks
in
one
case
gathered
with
a
great
deal
of
labour
on
the
shore
opposite
our
camp
and
ferried
across
on
our
boats
if
a
suitable
camp
was
found
after
we
kept
it
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
not
finding
another
until
after
dark
another
day
january
brought
us
to
the
end
of
this
gorge
and
into
a
wider
and
more
open
canyon
with
the
country
above
covered
with
volcanic
peaks
and
cinder
cones
had
broken
through
the
canyon
walls
close
to
the
top
of
the
gorge
pouring
streams
of
lava
down
its
sides
filling
the
bottom
of
the
canyon
with
several
hundred
feet
of
lava
this
condition
extended
down
the
canyon
for
twenty
miles
or
more
judging
by
the
amount
of
lava
the
eruption
must
have
continued
for
a
great
while
could
one
imagine
a
more
wonderful
sight
the
turbulent
stream
checked
by
the
fire
flood
from
above
what
explosions
and
rending
of
rocks
there
must
have
been
when
the
two
elements
met
the
river
would
be
backed
up
for
a
hundred
miles
each
would
be
shoved
on
from
behind
there
was
no
escape
they
must
fight
it
out
until
one
or
the
other
conquered
but
the
fire
could
not
keep
up
forever
and
though
triumphant
for
a
period
it
finally
succumbed
and
the
stream
proceeded
to
cut
down
to
the
original
level
two
miles
below
the
first
lava
flow
we
saw
what
we
took
to
be
smoke
and
hurried
down
wondering
if
we
would
find
a
prospector
or
a
cattle
rustler
we
agreed
if
it
was
the
latter
to
let
them
off
if
they
would
share
with
us
but
the
smoke
turned
out
to
be
warm
springs
one
of
them
making
quite
a
stream
which
fell
twenty
feet
into
the
river
here
in
the
river
was
a
cataract
called
lava
falls
so
filled
with
jagged
pieces
of
the
black
rock
that
a
portage
was
advisable
the
weather
had
not
moderated
any
in
the
last
week
and
we
were
in
the
water
a
great
deal
as
we
lifted
and
lined
the
boats
over
the
rocks
at
the
edge
of
the
rapids
we
would
work
in
the
water
until
numbed
with
the
cold
then
would
go
down
to
the
warm
springs
and
thaw
out
for
a
while
this
was
a
little
quicker
than
standing
by
the
fire
but
the
relief
was
only
temporary
this
portage
was
finished
the
next
morning
another
portage
was
made
this
same
day
and
the
wide
canyon
where
major
powell
found
some
indian
gardens
was
passed
in
the
afternoon
the
indians
were
not
at
home
when
the
major
called
his
party
felt
they
were
justified
in
helping
themselves
to
some
pumpkins
or
squash
for
their
supplies
were
very
low
and
they
could
not
go
out
to
a
settlement
as
we
expected
to
do
in
a
day
or
two
and
replenish
them
we
found
the
fish
would
not
bite
just
as
our
friend
the
miner
had
said
but
we
did
succeed
in
landing
a
salmon
in
one
of
the
deep
pools
not
many
miles
from
this
point
and
it
was
served
up
in
steaks
the
next
day
if
our
method
of
securing
the
salmon
was
unsportsmanlike
we
excused
ourselves
for
the
methods
used
just
as
major
powell
justified
his
appropriation
of
the
indians
squash
if
that
fish
was
ever
needed
it
was
then
and
it
was
a
most
welcome
addition
to
our
rapidly
disappearing
stock
of
provisions
we
were
only
sorry
we
had
not
taken
more
bait
the
next
day
we
did
see
a
and
on
climbing
the
shore
found
a
little
old
prospector
clad
in
tattered
garments
sitting
in
a
little
dugout
about
five
feet
square
which
he
had
shovelled
out
of
the
sand
he
had
roofed
it
with
mesquite
and
an
old
blanket
a
rapid
just
below
made
so
much
noise
that
he
did
not
hear
us
until
we
were
before
his
door
he
looked
at
the
rubber
coats
and
the
then
said
with
a
drawl
well
you
fellows
must
have
come
by
the
river
after
talking
awhile
he
asked
what
do
you
call
yourselves
this
question
would
identify
him
as
an
westerner
if
we
did
not
already
know
it
at
one
time
it
was
not
considered
discreet
to
ask
any
one
in
these
parts
what
their
name
was
or
where
they
were
from
he
gave
us
a
great
deal
of
information
about
the
country
and
said
that
diamond
creek
was
about
six
miles
below
he
had
come
across
from
diamond
creek
by
a
trail
over
a
thousand
foot
ridge
with
a
burro
and
a
pack
mule
a
month
before
he
had
just
been
out
near
the
top
on
the
opposite
side
doing
some
assessment
work
on
some
copper
claims
crossing
the
river
on
a
raft
and
stated
that
on
a
previous
occasion
he
had
been
drawn
over
the
rapid
but
got
out
when
he
learned
that
we
had
come
through
utah
he
stated
that
he
belonged
near
vernal
and
had
once
been
upset
in
the
upper
canyons
about
twenty
years
before
he
proved
to
be
the
snyder
of
whom
we
had
heard
at
linwood
and
also
from
the
chews
who
had
given
him
a
horse
so
he
could
get
out
over
the
mountains
yet
here
was
a
thousand
miles
below
cheerful
as
a
cricket
and
sure
that
a
few
months
at
the
most
would
bring
him
unlimited
wealth
he
asked
us
to
share
his
chuck
with
him
but
we
could
see
nothing
but
a
very
little
flour
and
a
little
bacon
so
pleaded
haste
and
pushed
on
for
diamond
creek
the
mouth
of
this
canyon
did
not
look
unlike
others
we
had
seen
in
this
section
and
one
could
easily
pass
it
without
knowing
that
it
ran
back
with
a
gentle
slope
for
twenty
miles
and
that
a
wagon
road
came
down
close
to
the
river
it
contained
a
small
clear
stream
the
original
tourist
camp
in
the
grand
canyon
was
located
up
this
canyon
we
packed
all
our
plates
and
films
ready
to
take
them
out
the
supplies
left
in
the
boats
when
we
went
out
the
next
morning
were
pounds
of
flour
partly
wet
and
crusted
pounds
mildewed
cream
of
wheat
or
cans
rusty
of
dried
beef
less
than
one
pound
of
sugar
we
carried
a
lunch
out
with
us
this
was
running
a
little
too
close
for
comfort
the
mouth
of
diamond
creek
canyon
was
covered
with
a
growth
of
large
mesquite
trees
cattle
trails
wound
through
this
thorny
thicket
down
to
the
river
edge
the
trees
thinned
out
a
short
distance
back
and
the
canyon
widened
as
it
receded
from
the
river
a
half
mile
back
from
the
river
was
the
old
slab
building
that
had
served
as
headquarters
for
the
campers
here
the
canyon
divided
one
containing
the
small
stream
heading
in
the
high
walls
to
the
southeast
while
the
other
branch
ran
directly
south
heading
near
the
railroad
at
the
little
of
peach
springs
miles
distant
it
was
growing
wider
and
more
with
every
mile
but
not
especially
interesting
to
one
who
had
seen
the
glory
of
all
the
canyons
floods
had
spoiled
what
had
once
been
a
very
passable
stage
road
dropping
feet
in
twenty
miles
down
to
the
very
depths
of
the
grand
canyon
some
cattle
driven
down
by
the
snows
were
sunning
themselves
near
the
building
our
appearance
filled
them
with
alarm
and
they
high
tailed
it
to
use
a
cattle
expression
scampering
up
the
rocky
slopes
a
deer
track
was
seen
in
a
away
from
the
river
on
the
sloping
walls
in
the
more
open
sections
of
this
valley
grew
the
chaparral
the
hackberry
and
the
first
specimens
of
the
palo
verde
were
found
in
this
vicinity
the
mesquite
trees
seen
at
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
were
real
trees
about
the
size
of
a
large
apple
tree
not
the
small
bushes
we
had
seen
at
the
little
colorado
all
the
growth
was
changing
as
we
neared
the
lower
altitudes
and
the
mouth
of
the
grand
canyon
being
that
of
the
hot
desert
which
had
found
this
artery
or
avenue
leading
to
the
heart
of
the
rocky
plateaus
and
had
pushed
its
way
into
this
foreign
land
even
the
animal
life
of
the
desert
has
followed
this
same
road
occasional
gila
monsters
which
are
supposed
to
belong
to
the
hot
desert
close
to
the
mexico
line
have
been
found
at
diamond
creek
and
lizards
of
the
mojave
desert
have
been
seen
as
far
north
as
the
foot
of
bright
angel
trail
but
we
saw
little
animal
life
at
this
time
there
were
occasional
otters
disporting
themselves
near
our
boats
in
one
instance
unafraid
in
another
raising
a
head
near
our
boat
with
a
startled
look
in
his
eyes
then
he
turned
and
began
to
swim
on
the
surface
until
our
laughter
caused
him
to
dive
tracks
of
the
or
the
cat
that
and
animal
somewhat
like
a
raccoon
and
much
resembling
a
weasel
were
often
seen
along
the
shores
the
gray
fox
the
and
the
coyote
all
natives
of
this
land
kept
to
the
higher
hills
the
beaver
seldom
penetrates
into
the
deep
canyons
because
of
the
lack
of
vegetation
but
is
found
in
all
sections
in
the
open
country
from
the
headwaters
to
the
delta
in
mexico
we
went
out
by
this
canyon
on
january
the
and
returned
sunday
january
the
bringing
enough
provisions
to
last
us
to
the
end
of
the
big
canyon
we
imagined
we
would
have
no
trouble
getting
what
we
needed
in
the
open
country
below
that
we
sent
some
telegrams
and
received
encouraging
answers
to
them
before
returning
with
us
were
two
brothers
john
and
will
nelson
cattle
men
who
had
given
us
a
cattle
man
welcome
when
we
arrived
at
peach
springs
there
was
no
store
at
peach
springs
and
they
supplied
us
with
the
provisions
that
we
brought
back
they
drove
a
wagon
for
about
half
the
distance
then
the
roads
became
impassable
so
they
unhitched
and
packed
their
bedding
and
our
provisions
in
to
the
river
the
nelsons
were
anxious
to
see
us
run
a
rapid
or
two
we
found
the
nights
to
be
just
as
cold
on
top
as
they
ever
get
in
this
section
a
little
below
zero
although
the
midday
sun
was
warm
enough
to
melt
the
snow
and
make
it
slushy
i
arrived
at
the
river
with
my
feet
so
swollen
that
i
had
difficulty
in
walking
a
condition
brought
on
by
a
previous
freezing
they
had
received
being
wet
continually
by
the
icy
water
in
my
boat
which
was
leaking
badly
since
we
left
bright
angel
and
the
walk
out
through
the
slush
i
was
glad
there
was
little
walking
to
do
when
once
at
the
river
and
changed
my
shoes
for
arctics
which
were
more
roomy
and
less
painful
on
the
upper
part
of
our
trip
there
were
occasional
days
when
emery
was
not
feeling
his
best
while
i
had
been
most
fortunate
and
had
little
complaint
to
make
now
things
seemed
to
be
reversed
emery
and
bert
too
were
having
the
time
of
their
lives
while
i
was
getting
mine
in
no
small
doses
we
had
always
imagined
that
the
grand
canyon
lost
its
depth
and
impressiveness
below
diamond
creek
we
were
to
learn
our
mistake
the
colour
was
missing
that
was
true
for
the
marble
and
sandstone
walls
were
brown
dirty
or
colourless
with
few
of
the
pleasing
tones
of
the
canyon
found
in
the
upper
end
but
it
was
still
the
grand
canyon
we
were
in
the
granite
again
granite
just
as
deep
as
any
we
had
seen
above
it
may
have
been
a
little
deeper
and
in
most
cases
it
was
very
sheer
there
was
very
little
plateau
the
limestone
and
sandstone
rose
above
that
just
as
they
had
above
kanab
canyon
the
walls
could
not
be
seen
many
of
the
rapids
of
this
lower
section
were
just
as
bad
as
any
we
had
gone
over
one
or
two
have
been
considered
worse
by
different
parties
two
hours
after
leaving
the
nelsons
we
were
halted
by
a
rapid
that
made
us
catch
our
breath
it
was
in
two
sections
the
lower
one
so
full
of
jagged
rocks
that
it
meant
a
wrecked
boat
the
upper
part
fell
about
twenty
feet
we
should
judge
and
was
bad
enough
it
was
a
question
if
we
could
run
this
and
keep
from
going
over
the
lower
part
if
we
made
a
portage
our
boats
would
have
to
be
taken
three
or
four
hundred
feet
up
the
side
of
the
cliff
the
rapid
was
too
strong
to
line
a
boat
down
we
concluded
to
risk
running
the
first
part
bert
climbed
to
the
head
of
the
second
section
of
the
rapid
where
a
projecting
point
of
granite
narrowed
the
stream
and
formed
a
quiet
eddy
just
above
the
foaming
plunge
if
we
could
keep
out
of
the
centre
and
land
here
we
would
be
safe
our
shoes
were
removed
our
trousers
were
rolled
to
our
knees
and
we
removed
our
coats
if
we
had
to
swim
there
we
were
going
to
be
prepared
the
were
well
inflated
and
tied
then
we
made
the
plunge
emery
taking
the
lead
i
following
close
behind
our
plan
was
to
keep
as
near
the
shore
as
possible
once
i
thought
it
was
all
over
when
i
saw
the
pulled
directly
for
a
rock
in
spite
of
all
emery
could
do
to
pull
away
nothing
but
a
rebounding
wave
saved
him
i
went
through
the
same
experience
several
times
we
were
threatened
with
an
upset
but
we
landed
in
safety
the
portage
was
short
and
easy
flat
granite
rocks
were
covered
with
a
thin
coat
of
ice
the
boats
were
unloaded
and
slid
across
then
dropped
below
the
projecting
rock
the
skidded
less
than
two
feet
and
struck
a
projecting
knob
of
rock
the
size
of
a
goose
egg
it
punctured
the
side
close
to
the
stern
fortunately
above
the
water
line
and
the
wood
was
not
entirely
broken
away
two
miles
below
this
we
found
another
bad
one
this
was
lined
while
bert
got
supper
up
in
a
little
sloping
canyon
about
as
uncomfortable
a
camp
as
we
had
found
many
of
the
rapids
run
the
next
day
were
violent
the
river
seemed
to
be
trying
to
make
up
for
lost
time
we
passed
a
canyon
coming
from
the
south
containing
two
streams
one
clear
and
one
muddy
the
narrowest
place
we
had
seen
on
the
river
was
a
rapid
run
this
day
not
over
forty
feet
wide
evening
brought
us
to
a
rapid
with
a
lateral
canyon
coming
in
from
each
side
that
on
the
right
containing
a
muddy
stream
the
walls
were
sheer
and
jagged
close
to
the
rapid
with
a
break
on
the
rugged
slopes
here
and
there
a
sloping
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
could
be
seen
in
the
third
section
of
the
rapid
this
was
separation
rapid
the
point
where
the
two
howland
brothers
and
dunn
parted
company
with
major
powell
and
his
party
from
our
camp
at
the
left
side
we
could
easily
figure
out
a
way
to
the
upper
plateau
above
that
they
would
have
a
difficult
climb
as
far
as
we
could
tell
that
they
did
reach
the
top
is
well
known
they
met
a
tragic
fate
the
second
day
after
getting
out
they
were
killed
by
some
indians
the
shewits
utes
who
had
treated
them
hospitably
at
first
and
provided
them
with
something
to
eat
that
night
a
visiting
indian
brought
a
tale
of
depredations
committed
by
some
miners
against
another
section
of
their
tribe
these
men
were
believed
to
be
the
guilty
parties
and
they
were
ambushed
the
next
morning
their
fate
remained
a
mystery
for
a
year
then
a
ute
was
seen
with
a
watch
belonging
to
one
of
the
men
later
a
mormon
who
had
a
great
deal
of
influence
with
the
indians
got
their
story
from
them
and
reported
to
major
powell
what
he
had
learned
it
was
a
deplorable
and
a
tragic
ending
to
what
otherwise
was
one
of
the
most
successful
daring
and
momentous
explorations
ever
undertaken
on
this
continent
we
find
there
is
a
current
belief
that
it
was
cowardice
and
fear
of
this
one
rapid
that
caused
these
men
to
separate
from
the
party
the
more
one
hears
of
this
separation
the
more
it
seems
that
it
was
a
difference
of
opinion
on
many
matters
and
not
this
one
rapid
that
caused
them
to
leave
these
men
had
been
trappers
and
hunters
one
might
say
pioneers
and
one
had
been
with
major
powell
before
the
river
exploration
they
had
gone
through
all
the
canyons
and
had
come
through
this
far
without
a
fatality
they
had
seen
a
great
many
rapids
nearly
as
bad
as
this
and
several
that
were
worse
if
one
could
judge
by
its
nature
when
we
found
it
they
were
not
being
carried
by
others
but
had
charge
of
one
boat
they
did
smash
one
boat
in
disaster
rapid
in
lodore
canyon
and
at
that
time
they
claimed
major
powell
gave
them
the
wrong
signal
this
caused
some
feeling
at
the
time
of
the
split
the
food
question
was
a
serious
one
there
were
short
rations
for
a
long
time
in
fact
there
was
practically
no
food
after
an
observation
major
powell
informed
them
that
they
were
within
miles
of
the
virgin
river
in
a
direct
line
much
of
the
country
between
the
end
of
the
canyon
and
the
virgin
river
was
open
a
few
mormon
settlements
could
be
found
up
the
virgin
valley
he
offered
them
half
of
the
small
stock
of
provisions
when
they
persisted
in
leaving
but
they
refused
to
take
any
provisions
whatever
feeling
sure
that
they
could
kill
enough
game
to
subsist
on
this
one
instance
would
seem
to
be
enough
to
clear
them
of
the
stigma
of
cowardice
the
country
on
top
was
covered
with
volcanic
cinders
there
was
little
water
to
be
found
and
in
many
ways
it
was
just
as
inhospitable
as
the
canyon
the
cook
had
a
pan
of
biscuits
which
he
left
on
a
rock
for
them
after
the
men
had
helped
the
party
lift
the
boats
over
the
rocks
at
the
head
of
the
rapid
after
landing
in
safety
around
a
bend
which
hid
them
from
sight
the
boating
party
fired
their
guns
hoping
they
would
hear
the
report
and
follow
in
the
abandoned
boat
it
is
doubtful
if
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
guns
above
the
roar
of
the
rapid
if
they
did
they
paid
no
attention
to
it
the
younger
howland
wished
to
remain
with
the
party
but
threw
his
lot
with
his
brother
when
he
withdrew
while
these
men
did
not
have
the
major
deep
scientific
interest
in
the
successful
completion
of
this
exploration
they
undoubtedly
should
have
stayed
with
their
leader
if
their
services
were
needed
or
desired
it
is
more
than
likely
that
they
were
insubordinate
they
certainly
made
a
misguided
attempt
but
in
spite
of
these
facts
it
scarcely
seems
just
to
brand
them
as
cowards
two
days
after
they
left
the
boating
party
was
camped
at
the
end
of
the
canyons
chapter
xxiii
the
last
portage
and
the
last
rapids
the
first
section
of
separation
rapid
was
run
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
a
manoeuvre
that
was
accomplished
by
starting
on
the
left
shore
and
crossing
the
swift
centre
clear
to
the
other
shore
this
allowed
us
to
reach
some
quiet
water
near
a
small
deposit
of
rock
and
earth
at
the
base
of
the
sheer
wall
two
feet
of
water
would
have
covered
this
deposit
likewise
two
feet
of
water
would
have
given
us
a
clear
channel
over
this
second
section
as
it
was
the
rapid
was
rough
with
many
rocks
very
near
the
surface
directly
across
from
us
close
to
the
left
shore
was
what
looked
like
a
geyser
or
fountain
of
water
this
was
caused
by
a
rock
in
the
path
of
a
strong
current
rebounding
from
the
shore
the
water
ran
up
on
the
side
near
the
wall
then
fell
on
all
sides
it
was
seldom
the
water
had
force
enough
to
carry
to
the
top
of
a
rock
as
large
as
that
this
portage
of
the
second
section
was
one
of
the
easiest
we
had
made
by
rolling
a
few
large
rocks
around
we
could
get
a
stream
water
across
our
small
shore
large
enough
to
float
an
empty
boat
with
a
little
help
so
we
lightened
them
of
the
cargo
and
floated
them
through
our
canal
while
running
the
third
section
the
was
carried
up
on
the
sloping
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
she
paused
a
moment
then
came
down
like
a
shot
and
whirled
around
to
the
side
without
mishap
this
made
the
thirteenth
rapid
in
which
both
boats
were
lined
or
portaged
in
three
other
rapids
one
boat
was
run
through
and
one
was
portaged
half
of
all
these
rapids
were
located
in
the
grand
canyon
all
this
time
we
were
anxiously
looking
forward
to
a
rapid
which
stone
had
described
as
being
the
worst
in
the
entire
series
also
the
last
rapid
we
would
be
likely
to
portage
and
had
informed
us
that
below
this
particular
rapid
everything
could
be
run
with
little
or
no
inspection
naturally
we
were
anxious
to
get
that
rapid
behind
us
it
was
described
as
being
located
below
a
small
stream
flowing
from
the
south
the
same
rapid
was
described
by
major
powell
as
having
a
bold
escarpment
at
the
head
of
the
rapid
on
the
right
we
had
not
seen
any
lava
since
leaving
diamond
creek
and
an
entry
in
my
notes
reads
we
have
gone
over
stone
rapid
three
times
and
it
is
still
ahead
of
us
the
knowledge
that
there
was
a
big
rapid
in
the
indefinite
somewhere
that
was
likely
to
cause
us
trouble
seemed
to
give
us
more
anxious
moments
than
the
many
unmentioned
rapids
we
were
finding
all
this
time
we
wondered
how
high
the
escarpment
was
and
if
we
could
take
our
boats
over
its
top
we
tried
to
convince
ourselves
that
it
was
behind
us
although
sure
that
it
could
not
be
but
the
absence
of
lava
puzzled
us
after
one
bad
rapid
and
several
good
rapids
we
came
to
a
sharp
turn
in
the
canyon
emery
was
ahead
and
called
back
i
see
a
little
stream
bert
joined
with
i
see
the
lava
and
the
bold
escarpment
rapid
as
we
had
been
calling
it
for
some
time
was
before
us
it
was
more
than
a
nasty
rapid
it
was
a
cataract
what
a
din
that
water
sent
up
we
had
to
yell
to
make
ourselves
heard
the
air
vibrated
with
the
impact
of
water
against
rock
the
rapid
was
nearly
half
a
mile
long
there
were
two
sections
near
its
head
staggered
with
great
rocks
forty
of
them
just
above
or
slightly
submerged
under
the
surface
of
the
water
our
low
stage
of
water
helped
us
so
that
we
did
not
have
to
line
the
boats
from
the
ledge
eighty
feet
above
the
water
as
others
had
done
the
rapid
broke
just
below
the
lower
end
of
the
sheer
rock
which
extended
twenty
feet
beyond
the
irregular
shore
the
went
first
headed
upstream
at
a
slight
angle
nearly
touching
the
wall
dropping
a
few
inches
between
each
restraining
stroke
of
the
oars
bert
crouched
on
the
bow
ready
to
spring
with
the
rope
as
soon
as
emery
passed
the
wall
and
headed
her
in
below
the
wall
jumping
to
the
shore
he
took
a
snub
around
a
boulder
and
kept
her
from
being
dragged
into
the
rapid
then
they
both
caught
the
as
she
swung
in
below
the
rock
and
half
the
battle
was
won
before
we
tackled
the
rapid
our
days
were
short
and
we
did
not
take
the
boats
down
until
the
next
day
but
we
did
carry
much
of
the
camp
material
and
cargo
halfway
down
over
ledges
a
hundred
feet
above
the
river
for
a
bad
rapid
we
were
very
fortunate
in
getting
past
it
as
easily
as
we
did
logs
were
laid
over
rocks
the
boats
were
skidded
over
them
about
their
own
length
and
dropped
in
again
logs
and
boats
were
lined
down
in
the
swift
but
less
riotous
water
to
the
next
barrier
which
was
more
difficult
a
rounded
boulder
lay
close
to
the
shore
with
smaller
rocks
smooth
and
scattered
between
powerful
currents
swirled
between
these
rocks
and
disappeared
under
two
others
wedged
closely
together
on
top
three
times
the
logs
were
snatched
from
our
grasp
as
we
tried
to
bridge
them
across
this
current
and
they
vanished
in
the
foam
to
shoot
out
end
first
twenty
feet
below
and
race
away
on
the
leaping
water
a
boat
would
be
smashed
to
if
once
carried
under
there
at
last
we
got
our
logs
wedged
and
an
hour
of
tugging
in
which
only
two
men
could
take
part
at
the
same
time
landed
both
boats
in
safety
below
this
barrier
we
shot
the
remainder
of
the
rapid
on
water
so
swift
that
the
oars
were
snatched
from
our
hands
if
we
tried
to
do
more
than
keep
the
boats
straight
with
the
current
that
rapid
was
no
longer
the
bold
escarpment
but
the
last
portage
instead
and
it
was
behind
us
the
afternoon
was
half
gone
when
we
made
ready
pull
away
from
the
last
portage
there
were
other
rapids
but
scarcely
a
pause
was
made
in
our
run
and
we
camped
away
from
the
roar
of
water
the
canyon
was
widening
out
a
little
at
a
time
the
granite
disappeared
in
the
following
day
run
at
noon
slopes
with
seeping
mineral
springs
took
the
place
of
precipitous
walls
they
dropped
to
feet
in
height
numerous
side
canyons
cut
the
walls
in
regular
sections
like
gigantic
city
blocks
instead
of
an
unbroken
avenue
small
rapids
continued
to
appear
there
were
a
few
small
islands
and
divided
currents
so
shallow
they
sometimes
kept
us
guessing
which
one
to
take
but
we
continued
to
run
them
all
without
a
pause
we
would
have
run
out
of
the
canyon
that
day
but
for
one
thing
five
were
seen
from
our
boats
in
one
of
the
sloping
grassy
meadows
above
the
river
we
landed
below
carried
our
cameras
back
and
spent
half
an
hour
in
trying
to
see
them
again
but
they
had
taken
alarm
placer
claim
locations
and
fresh
burro
tracks
were
seen
in
the
sand
at
our
last
grand
canyon
camp
and
a
half
mile
below
us
we
could
see
out
into
open
country
we
found
the
walls
or
the
end
of
the
to
be
about
two
thousand
feet
high
with
the
canyon
emerging
at
a
sharp
angle
so
that
a
narrow
ridge
or
lay
on
the
left
side
of
the
stream
once
out
in
the
open
the
walls
were
seen
to
be
quite
steep
but
could
be
climbed
to
the
top
almost
any
place
without
trouble
saturday
january
the
we
were
out
of
the
canyon
at
last
and
the
towering
walls
now
friendly
now
menacing
were
behind
us
three
hundred
and
large
rapids
and
nearly
twice
as
many
small
rapids
were
behind
us
and
the
dream
of
ten
years
was
an
accomplished
fact
but
best
of
all
there
were
no
tragedies
or
fatalities
to
record
perhaps
we
did
look
a
little
the
worse
for
wear
but
a
few
days
away
from
the
river
would
repair
all
that
the
boats
had
a
bump
here
and
there
besides
the
one
big
patch
on
the
a
little
mending
and
a
little
caulking
would
put
both
the
and
in
condition
there
is
little
of
interest
to
record
of
our
run
to
needles
california
it
was
a
land
of
desolation
an
extension
of
the
mojave
desert
on
the
south
and
the
alkaline
flats
and
mineral
mountains
of
nevada
on
the
north
of
death
valley
and
the
funeral
mountains
of
california
to
the
northwest
a
land
of
mountains
extending
north
and
south
across
our
way
a
and
land
of
extensive
flats
and
arroyos
a
land
of
rock
and
gravel
cemented
in
marls
and
clay
ungraced
with
any
but
the
desert
plants
cactus
and
thorny
shrubs
with
little
that
was
pleasing
or
attractive
a
desert
land
it
is
true
but
needing
only
the
magic
touch
of
water
to
transform
much
of
it
into
a
garden
spot
even
as
it
was
a
few
months
later
it
would
be
covered
with
the
flaming
blossoms
of
the
desert
growth
which
seem
to
try
to
make
amends
in
one
or
two
short
months
for
nearly
a
year
of
desolation
a
wash
ran
along
the
base
of
the
plateau
from
which
we
had
emerged
an
abandoned
road
and
ferry
showed
that
this
had
once
been
a
route
the
stream
had
a
good
current
and
we
pulled
away
only
stopping
once
to
see
the
last
of
our
plateau
before
a
turn
and
deepening
banks
hid
it
from
view
we
wondered
if
the
water
ever
dropped
in
a
precipitous
fall
over
the
face
of
the
wall
and
worked
back
a
little
every
year
as
it
does
at
niagara
we
could
hardly
doubt
that
there
were
some
such
falls
back
in
the
dim
past
when
these
canyons
were
being
carved
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
we
passed
a
ranch
or
a
house
with
a
little
garden
occupied
by
two
miners
who
hailed
us
from
the
shore
a
below
was
the
scanlon
ferry
a
binding
tie
between
arizona
on
the
south
and
what
was
now
nevada
on
the
north
for
we
had
reached
the
boundary
line
shortly
after
emerging
from
the
canyon
we
still
travelled
nearly
directly
west
the
ferry
was
in
charge
of
a
cornishman
who
also
had
as
pretty
a
little
ranch
as
one
could
expect
to
find
in
such
an
unlikely
place
a
purling
stream
of
water
piped
from
somewhere
up
in
the
hills
had
caused
the
transformation
the
ranch
was
very
homey
with
cattle
and
horses
sheep
and
hogs
dogs
and
cats
all
sleek
and
the
garden
proved
that
this
country
had
a
warm
climate
although
we
were
not
suffering
from
heat
at
that
time
an
effort
was
being
made
to
grow
some
orange
trees
but
with
little
promise
of
success
there
were
fig
trees
and
with
frozen
dates
hanging
on
the
branches
one
effect
of
the
coldest
winter
they
had
seen
in
this
section
the
rancher
told
us
he
could
not
sell
us
anything
that
had
to
be
brought
in
for
it
was
seventy
miles
to
the
railroad
but
we
could
look
over
such
supplies
as
he
had
it
ended
by
his
selling
us
a
chicken
two
dozen
eggs
five
pounds
of
honey
and
ten
pounds
of
flour
all
for
we
did
not
leave
until
the
next
morning
then
bought
another
jar
of
honey
for
we
had
no
sugar
and
of
the
first
jar
was
eaten
before
we
left
the
ferry
we
pulled
away
in
such
a
hurry
the
next
morning
that
we
forgot
an
axe
that
had
been
carried
with
us
for
the
entire
journey
a
run
brought
us
to
the
mouth
of
the
virgin
river
a
a
mile
wide
and
with
a
stream
little
larger
than
cataract
creek
winding
through
it
we
had
once
seen
this
stream
near
its
head
waters
a
beautiful
mountain
creek
that
seemed
to
bear
no
relation
to
this
stream
that
entered
from
the
north
a
large
adobe
building
apparently
deserted
stood
off
at
one
side
of
the
stream
this
was
the
head
of
navigation
for
steamboats
that
once
plied
between
here
and
the
towns
on
the
lower
end
of
the
river
they
carried
supplies
for
small
mines
scattered
through
the
mountains
and
took
out
cargoes
of
ore
and
of
rock
salt
which
was
mined
back
in
nevada
it
was
here
at
the
virgin
river
that
major
powell
concluded
his
original
voyage
of
exploration
some
of
his
men
took
the
boats
on
down
to
fort
mojave
a
few
miles
above
needles
afterwards
two
of
the
party
continued
on
to
the
gulf
the
country
below
the
virgin
river
had
been
explored
by
several
parties
but
previous
to
this
time
nothing
definite
was
known
of
the
gorges
until
this
exploration
by
this
most
remarkable
man
the
difficulties
of
this
hazardous
trip
were
increased
for
him
by
the
fact
that
he
had
lost
an
arm
in
the
civil
war
it
is
usually
taken
for
granted
that
the
united
states
government
was
back
of
this
exploration
this
was
true
of
the
second
expedition
but
not
of
the
first
major
powell
was
aided
to
a
certain
extent
by
the
state
college
of
illinois
otherwise
he
bore
all
the
expense
himself
we
received
from
the
government
to
apply
on
the
expenses
of
the
second
trip
we
felt
that
we
had
some
reason
to
feel
a
justifiable
pride
for
having
duplicated
in
some
ways
this
arduous
journey
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
do
more
than
guess
what
must
have
been
the
feelings
and
anxieties
of
this
explorer
added
to
the
fact
that
we
had
boats
tested
and
constructed
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
river
and
the
benefit
of
others
experiences
was
a
knowledge
that
we
were
not
likely
to
be
precipitated
over
a
waterfall
or
if
we
lost
everything
and
succeeded
in
climbing
out
that
there
were
a
few
ranches
and
distant
settlements
scattered
through
the
country
but
we
had
traversed
the
same
river
and
the
same
canyons
which
change
but
little
from
year
to
year
and
had
succeeded
beyond
our
fondest
hopes
in
having
accomplished
what
we
set
out
to
do
the
black
mountains
dark
and
forbidding
composed
of
a
hard
rock
which
gave
a
metallic
clink
and
decorated
with
large
spots
of
white
yellow
vermilion
and
purple
deposits
of
volcanic
ashes
were
entered
this
afternoon
the
peaks
were
about
a
thousand
feet
high
the
passage
between
is
known
as
boulder
canyon
here
we
met
two
miners
at
work
on
a
tunnel
or
drift
who
informed
us
that
it
was
about
forty
miles
to
las
vegas
nevada
and
that
it
was
only
miles
from
the
mouth
of
las
vegas
wash
farther
down
the
river
to
this
same
town
and
the
railroad
fort
callville
an
abandoned
rock
building
constructed
by
the
directions
of
brigham
young
without
windows
or
roof
and
surrounded
by
stone
corrals
was
passed
the
next
day
at
las
vegas
wash
the
river
turned
at
right
angles
going
directly
south
holding
with
very
little
deviation
to
this
general
direction
until
it
empties
into
the
gulf
of
california
nearly
five
hundred
miles
away
the
river
seemed
to
be
growing
smaller
as
we
got
out
in
the
open
country
like
all
western
rivers
when
unprotected
by
canyons
it
was
sinking
in
the
sand
impeded
our
progress
at
such
places
as
the
mouth
of
the
wash
but
we
had
a
good
current
without
rapids
in
black
canyon
which
came
shortly
below
and
mile
after
mile
was
put
behind
us
before
we
camped
for
the
night
an
old
closed
for
the
time
but
in
charge
of
three
men
who
were
making
preparations
to
resume
work
was
passed
the
next
day
they
had
telephone
communication
with
searchlight
nevada
twenty
odd
miles
away
and
we
sent
out
some
telegrams
in
that
way
more
were
encountered
the
next
day
and
ranches
began
to
appear
on
both
sides
of
the
river
we
had
difficulty
on
some
of
these
bars
in
places
the
river
bed
was
a
mile
wide
with
stagnant
pools
above
the
sand
and
with
one
deep
channel
twisting
between
at
fort
mojave
now
an
indian
school
and
agency
we
telephoned
to
some
friends
in
needles
as
we
had
promised
to
do
telling
them
we
would
arrive
about
noon
of
the
following
day
we
made
a
mistake
in
not
camping
at
the
high
ground
by
the
fort
that
night
for
just
below
the
river
widened
again
and
the
channel
turned
out
in
the
centre
it
was
getting
dark
and
we
had
entered
this
before
noticing
which
way
it
turned
and
had
a
hard
pull
back
to
the
shore
for
we
had
no
desire
to
camp
out
there
in
the
quicksand
the
shore
was
little
more
desirable
it
was
a
marsh
covered
with
a
growth
of
flags
and
tules
but
with
the
ground
frozen
enough
so
that
we
did
not
sink
our
last
camp
no
was
made
in
this
marsh
there
we
spent
the
night
hidden
like
hunted
savages
in
the
while
an
indian
brass
band
played
some
very
good
music
for
an
officers
ball
less
than
half
a
mile
away
we
were
up
and
away
with
the
sun
the
next
morning
on
nearing
needles
a
friend
met
us
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
informed
us
that
they
had
arranged
what
he
called
an
official
landing
and
reception
at
his
request
we
deferred
going
down
at
once
but
busied
ourselves
instead
at
packing
our
cargo
ready
for
shipping
our
friend
had
secured
the
services
of
a
operator
and
our
own
camera
was
sent
down
to
make
a
picture
of
the
landing
which
was
made
as
he
had
arranged
we
landed
in
needles
january
one
month
from
the
time
of
our
start
from
bright
angel
trail
with
a
total
of
one
hundred
and
one
days
spent
along
the
river
in
that
time
our
camps
had
been
changed
times
our
two
boats
highly
prized
as
souvenirs
of
our
twelve
hundred
mile
trip
and
which
had
carried
us
through
three
hundred
and
big
rapids
over
a
total
descent
of
more
than
five
thousand
feet
were
loaded
on
cars
ready
for
shipment
the
to
los
angeles
the
to
the
grand
canyon
among
other
mail
awaiting
us
was
the
following
letter
bearing
the
postmark
of
hite
utah
kolb
dear
friends
well
i
got
here
at
last
after
seventeen
days
in
cataract
canyon
the
old
boat
will
stand
a
little
quiet
water
but
will
never
go
through
another
rapid
i
certainly
played
some
of
those
rocks
in
cataract
canyon
i
tried
every
scheme
i
had
ever
heard
of
and
some
that
were
never
thought
of
before
at
the
last
rapid
in
cataract
i
carried
all
my
stuff
over
the
cliff
then
tried
to
line
the
boat
from
the
narrow
ledge
the
boat
jerked
me
into
the
river
but
i
did
not
lose
my
hold
on
the
chain
and
climbed
on
board
i
had
no
oars
but
managed
to
get
through
without
striking
any
rocks
and
landed
a
mile
and
a
half
below
the
supplies
i
hope
the
are
good
sincerely
yours
chas
smith
conclusion
how
i
went
to
mexico
chapter
xxiv
on
the
crest
of
a
flood
a
train
was
bearing
me
across
the
mojave
desert
one
day
in
may
in
a
few
swiftly
passing
hours
we
had
made
a
foot
descent
from
the
plateau
with
its
fir
and
mountain
its
cedar
and
and
its
extensive
forests
of
yellow
pine
crimson
and
cactus
sage
and
chaparral
succeeded
the
pines
the
cool
mountains
had
given
way
to
hills
arroyos
and
seemingly
endless
desert
and
the
sun
was
growing
hotter
every
minute
if
the
heat
continued
to
increase
i
doubted
if
i
would
care
to
take
a
colorado
river
trip
down
to
the
gulf
visions
of
the
california
beaches
of
fishing
at
catalina
and
of
horseback
rides
over
the
sierra
trails
nearly
unsettled
my
determination
to
stop
at
needles
on
the
california
side
of
the
river
this
was
my
vacation
why
undergo
all
the
discomfort
of
a
voyage
on
a
desert
stream
when
the
pleasures
and
comforts
of
the
pacific
beckoned
one
thing
was
sure
if
i
was
not
successful
in
securing
a
boat
at
needles
the
very
next
train
would
find
me
on
board
bound
for
the
western
slope
by
the
chaparral
had
disappeared
and
only
the
cactus
remained
the
ocotilla
covered
with
a
million
flowers
wave
upon
wave
of
crimson
flame
against
the
yellow
earth
mountains
appeared
in
the
west
marking
the
southern
trend
of
the
colorado
the
air
was
suffocating
the
wind
was
like
a
blast
from
a
furnace
yet
with
the
electric
fans
whirring
with
blinds
drawn
and
windows
closed
to
keep
the
withering
air
it
seemed
a
little
less
uncomfortable
in
the
car
in
spite
of
the
unvitalized
air
than
under
the
scorching
sun
we
were
beside
the
colorado
at
last
i
had
a
good
view
of
the
stream
below
as
we
crossed
the
bridge
the
colorado
in
flood
muddy
turbulent
sweeping
onward
like
an
affrighted
thing
repulsive
yet
with
a
fascination
for
me
born
of
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
dangers
of
this
stream
the
river
had
called
again
the
heat
was
forgotten
the
visions
of
the
coast
faded
for
me
the
train
could
not
reach
needles
ten
miles
up
the
river
quickly
enough
with
my
brother
i
had
followed
this
stream
down
to
needles
through
a
thousand
miles
of
canyon
i
had
seen
how
it
carved
its
way
through
the
mountains
carrying
them
on
in
solution
toward
the
ocean
at
last
i
would
see
what
became
of
all
these
misplaced
mountains
i
would
see
the
tidal
bore
as
it
swept
in
from
the
gulf
i
had
heard
there
were
wild
hogs
which
burrowed
through
the
it
may
be
that
i
would
learn
of
a
vessel
at
some
port
down
on
the
mexican
coast
which
i
might
reach
and
which
would
take
me
around
the
lower
california
peninsula
i
felt
sure
there
was
such
a
port
no
doubt
i
could
have
found
books
to
tell
me
exactly
what
i
would
see
but
too
much
information
would
spoil
all
the
romance
of
such
an
adventure
it
was
all
very
alluring
with
the
spring
flood
on
the
river
could
not
help
but
be
interesting
and
exciting
a
pretty
good
imitation
of
the
rapids
perhaps
if
i
could
only
secure
a
boat
half
an
hour
later
i
was
meeting
old
acquaintances
about
the
hotel
connected
with
the
station
the
genial
hotel
manager
with
the
irish
name
was
smilingly
explaining
to
some
newcomers
that
this
was
not
hot
that
a
dry
heat
at
degrees
was
not
nearly
as
bad
as
degrees
back
in
chicago
and
as
for
heat
he
continued
why
down
in
yuma
then
he
caught
sight
of
me
with
a
grin
on
my
face
and
perhaps
he
remembered
that
i
had
heard
him
say
the
same
thing
two
years
before
when
it
was
even
hotter
and
he
came
over
with
hand
calling
me
uncomplimentary
names
under
his
breath
for
spoiling
the
effect
of
his
explanation
all
which
was
belied
by
his
welcome
it
takes
an
irishman
to
run
a
big
hotel
in
the
middle
of
the
desert
a
few
inquiries
brought
out
the
information
that
i
was
not
likely
to
get
a
boat
the
stores
did
not
keep
them
i
should
have
given
my
order
two
weeks
before
to
an
indian
who
built
boats
to
order
at
a
foot
this
was
a
new
one
on
me
suppose
a
fellow
wanted
well
say
about
worth
it
would
look
something
like
a
tub
would
it
perhaps
it
was
to
be
the
coast
for
me
after
all
the
colorado
river
in
flood
is
a
terrible
stream
unlike
the
eastern
rivers
there
are
no
populous
cities
with
apologies
to
needles
and
yuma
along
its
shores
to
be
inundated
with
the
floods
unlike
the
rivers
of
the
south
few
great
agricultural
districts
spread
across
its
bottoms
along
the
upper
seven
hundred
miles
there
are
not
a
ranches
with
acres
under
cultivation
but
if
destructive
power
and
untamed
energy
are
terrible
the
colorado
river
in
flood
is
a
terrible
stream
after
changing
into
some
comfortable
clothes
i
sauntered
past
the
railway
machine
shops
down
to
the
river
and
up
to
where
a
fight
was
being
waged
to
save
the
upper
part
of
the
town
from
being
torn
away
by
the
flood
for
a
month
past
car
after
car
of
rock
had
been
dumped
along
the
river
bank
only
to
disappear
in
the
quicksands
and
as
yet
no
bottom
had
been
reached
up
to
this
point
the
fight
was
about
equal
the
flood
would
not
reach
its
crest
until
two
or
three
weeks
later
beyond
a
fisherman
or
two
there
were
few
men
by
the
river
the
workmen
had
finished
their
day
labour
a
ferryman
said
that
i
might
talk
an
indian
into
selling
his
boat
but
it
was
doubtful
my
next
job
was
to
find
such
an
indian
a
big
greasy
mojave
buck
lay
on
an
uncovered
rusty
bed
spring
slung
on
a
frame
before
his
willow
and
adobe
home
close
to
the
colorado
river
in
answer
to
my
repeated
question
he
uncoiled
and
stretched
the
full
length
of
his
six
foot
six
couch
grunted
a
few
words
in
his
native
tongue
to
other
indians
without
a
glance
in
my
direction
then
indifferently
closed
his
eyes
again
a
young
indian
in
garb
not
omitting
a
gorgeous
silk
handkerchief
about
his
neck
jabbered
awhile
with
some
grinning
squaws
then
said
in
perfectly
understandable
english
he
will
sell
his
boat
for
it
is
worth
this
was
decisive
for
an
indian
it
usually
takes
a
of
bickering
to
get
them
to
make
any
kind
of
a
bargain
i
told
him
i
would
take
it
in
the
morning
it
was
a
boat
almost
new
built
of
inch
pine
and
otherwise
quite
similar
in
shape
to
the
boats
my
brother
and
i
had
used
on
our
twelve
hundred
mile
journey
through
the
canyons
of
the
green
and
colorado
rivers
but
without
the
graceful
lines
and
swells
that
made
those
other
boats
so
valuable
to
us
in
rapids
the
boat
was
nearly
new
and
well
worth
as
boat
prices
went
in
that
town
why
he
was
willing
to
sell
it
for
or
at
the
rate
of
a
foot
i
could
not
imagine
it
was
the
first
bargain
an
indian
had
ever
offered
me
but
if
i
paid
for
it
that
evening
there
were
doubts
in
my
mind
if
i
should
find
it
in
the
morning
so
i
delayed
closing
the
bargain
and
went
back
again
to
inspect
the
boat
that
evening
i
inquired
among
my
acquaintances
if
there
was
any
one
who
would
care
to
accompany
me
if
so
i
would
give
them
passage
to
yuma
or
to
the
gulf
of
california
in
mexico
if
they
wished
it
but
no
one
could
go
or
those
who
could
would
one
would
have
thought
from
the
stories
with
which
i
was
regaled
that
the
rapids
of
the
grand
canyon
were
below
needles
and
as
for
going
to
the
gulf
it
was
suicide
i
was
told
of
the
outlaws
along
the
border
of
the
firearms
and
opium
smugglers
who
shot
first
and
questioned
afterward
and
of
the
insurrectos
of
lower
california
the
river
had
no
real
outlet
to
the
ocean
they
said
since
the
break
into
salton
sea
but
spread
over
a
thirty
miles
or
more
in
width
many
people
had
gone
into
these
swamps
and
never
returned
whether
lost
in
the
jungles
or
killed
by
the
cocopah
indians
no
one
knew
they
simply
disappeared
it
was
all
very
alluring
my
preparations
the
next
day
were
few
i
had
included
a
sleeping
bag
with
my
baggage
it
would
come
in
equally
handy
whether
i
went
down
on
the
colorado
or
up
into
the
coast
range
a
a
a
few
metal
dishes
and
provisions
for
a
week
were
all
i
needed
some
one
suggested
some
bent
poles
and
a
cover
such
as
are
used
on
wagons
to
keep
off
the
sun
this
seemed
like
a
good
idea
and
i
hunted
up
a
carpenter
who
did
odd
jobs
he
did
not
have
such
a
one
but
he
did
have
an
old
cover
which
could
be
raised
or
dropped
at
will
this
was
even
better
for
sometimes
hard
winds
sweep
up
the
river
the
cover
was
fastened
to
the
sides
of
the
boat
the
boat
meanwhile
had
been
thoroughly
scrubbed
it
looked
clean
before
but
i
was
not
going
to
take
any
chances
at
carrying
indian
along
with
his
boat
my
surplus
baggage
was
sent
on
to
los
angeles
and
hours
after
i
had
landed
in
needles
i
was
ready
to
embark
my
experience
in
camping
trips
of
various
sorts
has
been
that
the
start
from
headquarters
occupies
more
time
than
any
similar
preparation
once
on
the
road
things
naturally
arrange
themselves
into
some
kind
of
a
system
and
an
hour
on
the
road
in
the
evening
means
several
hours
gained
the
next
morning
added
to
this
there
are
always
a
number
of
loafers
about
railroad
towns
and
small
things
have
a
way
of
disappearing
with
this
in
mind
i
determined
to
make
my
start
that
evening
and
at
on
the
of
may
i
embarked
on
a
six
to
eight
mile
an
hour
current
paced
by
cottonwood
logs
carried
down
by
the
flood
from
the
head
waters
in
wyoming
utah
and
colorado
when
sailing
on
the
unruffled
current
one
did
not
notice
its
swiftness
it
sped
so
quietly
yet
at
the
same
time
with
such
deadly
intent
until
some
half
submerged
cottonwood
snags
appeared
their
jagged
broken
limbs
ploughing
the
stream
exactly
like
the
bow
of
a
boat
throwing
two
diverging
lines
of
waves
far
down
the
stream
one
would
almost
think
the
boat
was
motionless
it
raced
so
smoothly
and
that
the
snags
were
tearing
upstream
as
a
river
man
had
said
the
day
before
like
a
dog
with
a
bone
in
his
teeth
a
sunken
with
a
cabin
half
submerged
seemed
propelled
by
some
unseen
power
and
rapidly
dwindled
in
the
distance
so
fascinating
were
these
things
that
i
forgot
the
approaching
night
i
first
noticed
it
when
the
stream
slackened
its
mad
pace
and
spread
over
its
banks
into
great
wide
marshes
in
divided
and
subdivided
channels
and
over
submerged
islands
with
nothing
but
willow
and
fuzzy
cattail
tops
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
bottom
underneath
here
there
was
no
place
to
camp
had
i
wished
to
do
so
once
i
missed
the
main
channel
and
had
a
difficult
time
in
finding
my
way
back
in
the
dark
after
two
or
three
miles
of
this
quiet
current
the
streams
began
to
unite
again
and
the
river
regained
its
former
speed
i
was
growing
weary
after
the
first
excitement
and
began
to
wish
myself
well
out
of
it
all
and
safely
anchored
to
the
shore
but
i
knew
there
was
a
level
bank
above
the
river
close
to
the
bridge
which
would
make
a
good
camping
place
so
i
rested
on
my
oars
facing
down
the
stream
with
eyes
and
ears
alert
for
the
treacherous
snags
then
the
stars
began
to
appear
one
by
one
lighting
up
the
cloudless
sky
a
moist
breeze
moved
up
the
stream
the
channel
narrowed
and
deepened
the
snags
vanished
and
the
stream
increased
its
swiftness
and
with
eyes
wide
open
but
unseeing
i
dozed
it
was
the
lights
of
a
passenger
train
crossing
the
bridge
just
a
short
distance
away
that
made
me
realize
where
i
was
the
train
thundered
into
the
darkness
but
louder
than
the
roar
of
the
train
was
that
of
the
water
directly
ahead
and
hidden
in
the
impenetrable
shadow
over
on
the
right
shore
was
a
noise
much
like
that
made
by
a
grand
canyon
rapid
wide
awake
now
i
pulled
for
the
left
and
after
one
or
two
attempts
to
land
i
caught
some
willow
tops
and
guided
the
boat
to
the
raised
bank
beyond
the
willows
was
a
higher
ground
covered
with
a
mesquite
thicket
with
cattle
trails
winding
under
the
thorny
trees
here
i
unrolled
my
sleeping
bag
then
went
up
to
interview
the
operator
and
the
watchman
and
to
get
a
drink
of
clear
water
for
i
had
no
desire
to
drink
the
liquid
mud
of
the
colorado
until
it
was
necessary
in
answer
to
a
question
i
told
them
of
my
little
ride
one
of
the
men
exclaimed
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
came
down
on
the
flood
after
dark
on
being
informed
that
i
had
just
arrived
he
exclaimed
well
i
reckon
you
do
know
what
the
colorado
is
it
a
wonder
this
whirlpool
did
break
you
against
the
pier
you
ought
to
have
brought
some
one
with
you
to
see
you
drown
chapter
xxv
four
days
to
yuma
before
sunrise
the
following
morning
i
had
completed
my
few
camp
duties
finished
my
breakfast
and
dropped
my
boat
into
the
whirlpool
above
the
bridge
my
two
friends
watched
the
manoeuvre
as
i
pulled
clear
of
the
logs
and
the
piers
which
caused
the
water
to
make
such
alarming
sounds
the
night
before
then
they
gave
me
a
final
word
of
caution
and
the
information
that
the
parker
bridge
was
sixty
miles
away
and
that
yuma
was
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
down
the
stream
they
thought
that
i
should
reach
yuma
in
a
week
it
seemed
but
a
few
minutes
until
the
bridge
was
a
mile
up
the
stream
now
i
was
truly
embarked
for
the
gulf
by
the
time
i
had
reached
the
mountainous
rocks
a
few
miles
below
the
bridge
which
gave
the
town
of
needles
its
name
the
sun
was
well
up
and
i
was
beginning
to
learn
what
desert
heat
was
although
i
had
little
time
to
think
of
it
as
i
was
kept
so
busy
with
my
boat
here
the
stream
which
was
spread
a
mile
wide
above
had
choked
down
to
two
hundred
feet
small
violent
whirlpools
formed
at
the
abrupt
turns
in
this
canyon
and
the
water
tore
from
side
to
side
in
one
whirl
my
boat
was
twice
carried
around
the
circle
into
which
i
had
allowed
it
to
be
caught
then
shot
out
on
the
pounding
flood
soon
the
mountains
were
passed
and
the
country
began
to
spread
first
in
a
high
barren
land
then
with
a
bottom
land
running
back
from
the
river
the
willow
bushes
changed
to
willow
trees
tall
and
spindly
crowded
in
a
thicket
down
to
the
river
edge
the
chemehuevi
indians
have
their
reservation
here
on
rounding
an
abrupt
turn
i
surprised
two
little
naked
children
fat
as
butterballs
dabbling
in
a
mud
puddle
close
to
the
stream
the
sight
coupled
with
the
heat
and
the
jungle
could
well
make
one
imagine
he
was
in
africa
or
india
and
that
the
little
brown
bodies
were
the
alligator
bait
of
which
we
read
only
the
were
missing
the
unexpected
sight
of
a
boat
and
a
white
man
trying
to
photograph
them
started
them
both
into
a
frightened
squall
then
an
indignant
mother
appeared
staring
at
me
as
though
she
would
like
to
know
what
i
had
done
to
her
offspring
farther
along
were
other
squaws
with
red
and
blue
lines
pencilled
on
their
childlike
contented
faces
seated
under
the
willows
their
cotton
garments
of
red
and
blue
bandanna
handkerchiefs
sewed
together
added
a
gay
bit
of
colour
to
the
scene
below
this
were
two
or
three
cozy
little
ranch
houses
and
a
few
scattered
cattle
ranches
with
cattle
browsing
back
in
the
trees
all
this
time
it
was
getting
hotter
and
i
was
thankful
for
my
sheltering
cover
my
lunch
prepared
in
the
morning
was
eaten
as
i
drifted
except
in
a
few
quiet
stretches
i
did
little
rowing
just
enough
to
keep
the
boat
away
from
the
overhanging
banks
and
in
the
strong
current
the
bottom
lands
began
to
build
up
again
with
banks
of
gravel
and
clay
growing
higher
with
every
mile
the
deciduous
trees
gave
way
to
the
desert
growths
the
cholla
the
shower
of
gold
and
the
palo
verde
and
the
other
acacias
here
were
the
california
or
and
lean
here
too
were
the
coyotes
leaner
than
the
rabbits
but
efficient
and
insolent
one
could
admire
but
could
hardly
respect
them
i
had
entertained
hopes
of
reaching
parker
that
evening
but
supposed
the
hour
would
be
late
if
i
reached
it
at
all
imagine
my
surprise
then
when
at
four
i
heard
the
whistle
of
a
train
and
another
turn
revealed
the
parker
bridge
i
had
been
told
by
others
that
it
had
taken
them
three
or
four
days
to
reach
this
point
on
a
low
stage
of
water
evidently
the
high
water
is
much
better
for
rapid
and
interesting
travel
here
at
the
bridge
which
was
a
hundred
feet
above
the
river
was
a
dredge
and
an
old
steamboat
a
relic
of
a
few
years
past
before
the
government
built
the
laguna
dam
above
yuma
and
condemned
the
colorado
as
a
navigable
stream
those
were
the
days
which
the
colorado
steamboat
men
recall
with
as
much
fond
remembrance
as
the
boatmen
of
the
mississippi
remember
their
palmy
days
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
boats
were
and
small
it
was
real
steamboating
of
an
exciting
nature
at
least
at
times
they
beat
up
against
the
current
as
far
as
the
mouth
of
the
rio
virgin
in
low
water
the
channels
shifted
back
and
forth
first
choked
with
sand
on
one
side
of
the
stream
then
on
the
other
while
the
total
fall
from
fort
mojave
a
few
miles
above
needles
to
the
gulf
is
only
feet
considerable
of
that
fall
came
in
short
sections
first
with
a
swift
descent
then
in
a
quiet
stretch
even
in
the
stage
i
was
finding
some
such
places
parker
stood
a
mile
back
from
the
river
on
top
of
the
level
gravelly
earth
which
stretched
for
miles
on
either
side
of
the
river
clear
to
the
mountains
this
earth
and
gravel
mixture
was
so
firmly
packed
that
even
the
cactus
had
a
scant
foothold
the
town
interested
me
for
one
reason
only
this
being
that
i
could
get
my
meals
for
the
evening
and
the
following
morning
instead
of
having
to
cook
them
myself
after
i
had
eaten
them
however
there
was
a
question
in
my
mind
if
my
own
cooking
bad
as
it
was
would
not
have
answered
the
purpose
just
as
well
the
place
was
a
new
railroad
town
on
an
indian
reservation
a
town
of
great
expectations
somewhat
deferred
it
was
not
as
interesting
to
me
as
my
next
stop
at
ahrenburg
some
fifty
miles
below
parker
this
place
while
nothing
but
a
collection
of
dilapidated
adobe
buildings
had
an
air
of
romance
about
it
which
was
missing
in
the
newer
town
ahrenburg
had
seen
its
day
many
years
ago
it
was
a
busy
mining
camp
and
the
hope
is
entertained
by
the
faithful
who
still
reside
in
its
picturesque
adobe
homes
that
it
will
come
back
with
renewed
vigour
here
at
ahrenburg
i
met
a
character
who
added
greatly
to
the
interest
of
my
stay
he
was
a
gigantic
frenchman
at
that
time
engaged
in
the
construction
of
a
motor
boat
but
a
miner
a
sailor
and
a
soldier
of
fortune
in
many
ways
one
who
had
pried
into
many
of
the
hidden
corners
of
the
country
and
had
a
graphic
way
of
describing
what
he
had
seen
i
was
his
guest
until
late
that
night
and
was
entertained
royally
on
what
humble
fare
he
had
to
offer
we
both
intended
to
renew
our
acquaintance
in
the
morning
but
some
prowling
mexicans
near
my
boat
croaking
frogs
and
swarms
of
mosquitos
gave
me
a
restless
night
with
the
first
glimmer
of
daylight
i
was
up
and
half
an
hour
later
i
was
away
on
the
flood
this
was
my
big
day
the
current
was
better
than
much
of
that
above
i
was
getting
used
to
the
heat
and
instead
of
idly
drifting
i
pulled
steadily
at
the
oars
the
river
twisted
back
and
forth
in
great
loops
with
the
strong
current
as
is
usual
always
on
the
outside
of
the
loops
close
to
the
overhanging
banks
i
would
keep
my
boat
in
this
current
with
a
wary
lookout
over
my
shoulder
for
fallen
trees
and
sudden
turns
which
had
a
way
of
appearing
when
least
expected
at
some
such
places
the
stream
was
engaged
at
undermining
the
banks
which
rose
eight
and
ten
feet
above
the
water
occasional
sections
containing
tons
of
earth
and
covered
with
tall
slender
willow
trees
would
topple
over
falling
on
the
water
with
the
roar
of
a
cannon
or
a
continued
salute
of
cannons
for
the
falling
once
started
quite
often
extended
for
half
a
mile
down
the
stream
at
one
such
place
eighteen
trees
fell
in
three
minutes
and
it
would
be
safe
to
say
that
a
hundred
trees
were
included
in
the
extended
fall
the
trees
sixty
feet
high
resembled
a
field
of
gigantic
grass
or
unripened
grain
the
river
was
a
reaper
cutting
it
away
at
the
roots
over
they
tumbled
to
be
buried
in
the
stream
the
water
would
swirl
and
boil
earth
and
trees
would
disappear
then
the
mass
of
timber
freed
of
the
earth
would
wash
away
to
lodge
on
the
first
and
the
formation
of
a
new
island
or
a
new
shore
would
begin
then
again
the
banks
were
barren
composed
of
gravel
and
clay
centuries
older
than
the
land
undisturbed
possibly
since
some
glacial
period
deposited
it
there
but
a
shifting
of
the
channel
directed
the
attack
against
these
banks
here
the
swift
current
would
find
a
little
irregularity
on
the
surface
and
would
begin
its
cutting
the
water
bored
exactly
like
an
auger
in
whirls
one
such
place
i
watched
for
a
from
the
very
beginning
until
the
undermined
section
fourteen
feet
high
began
to
topple
and
i
pulled
out
to
safety
but
not
far
enough
to
escape
a
ducking
in
the
resulting
wave
below
this
instead
of
a
firm
earth
it
was
a
loose
sand
and
gravel
mixture
twenty
feet
above
the
river
here
for
half
a
mile
the
entire
bank
was
moving
slowly
at
the
top
gathering
speed
at
the
bottom
while
close
to
this
i
heard
a
peculiar
hissing
as
of
carbonated
water
all
about
me
at
first
i
thought
there
were
mineral
springs
underneath
but
found
the
noise
was
caused
by
breaking
air
bubbles
carried
under
the
stream
with
the
sands
all
this
day
such
phenomena
continued
sliding
and
tumbling
jungles
in
these
latter
places
some
cattle
had
suffered
their
trails
ran
parallel
with
the
stream
no
doubt
they
had
one
or
two
places
where
they
drank
cut
down
to
the
stream
knowing
nothing
of
the
cutting
underneath
they
had
been
precipitated
into
the
flood
and
now
their
carcasses
were
food
for
swarms
of
vultures
gathered
for
an
unholy
feast
what
powerful
graceful
birds
these
scavengers
are
stronger
than
the
eagle
even
tireless
and
seemingly
motionless
as
they
drift
along
searching
every
nook
and
cranny
for
their
provender
but
aside
from
a
grudgingly
given
tribute
of
admiration
for
their
power
one
has
about
as
much
respect
for
them
as
for
the
equally
graceful
rattlesnake
that
other
product
of
nature
which
flourishes
in
this
desert
land
the
bird
life
along
this
lower
part
of
the
river
was
wonderful
in
its
variety
the
birds
of
the
desert
mingled
with
those
of
the
fertile
lands
the
vied
with
those
of
gorgeous
plume
disported
themselves
in
the
and
sloughs
the
smaller
birds
seemed
to
pay
little
attention
to
the
nearness
of
the
hawks
kingfisher
perched
on
limbs
overhanging
the
quiet
pools
ready
to
drop
at
the
faintest
movement
on
the
opaque
water
the
chased
the
festive
lizard
on
the
desert
land
back
of
the
willows
here
also
in
the
mesquite
and
giant
cactus
were
thrush
and
western
and
mimicking
the
call
of
the
down
in
the
brush
by
the
river
was
the
happy
little
as
cheerful
in
his
way
as
the
musical
canyon
wren
the
mexican
crossbill
appeared
to
have
little
fear
of
the
migrating
northern
shrike
there
were
warblers
cardinals
tanagers
waxwings
and
chickadees
flitting
droves
of
dropped
on
to
slender
weeds
scarcely
bending
them
so
light
were
they
then
in
a
minute
they
were
gone
in
the
swamps
or
marshes
were
countless
blackbirds
the
most
unobservant
person
could
not
help
but
see
birds
here
i
had
expected
to
find
for
the
colorado
delta
is
their
breeding
place
but
i
little
expected
to
find
so
many
land
birds
in
the
trees
along
the
river
instead
of
having
a
lonesome
trip
every
minute
was
filled
with
something
new
interesting
and
beautiful
and
i
was
having
the
time
of
my
life
i
camped
that
night
at
picachio
meaning
the
pocket
eighty
miles
below
ahrenburg
this
is
still
a
mining
district
but
the
pockets
containing
nuggets
of
gold
which
gave
the
place
its
name
seem
to
have
all
been
discovered
at
the
time
of
the
boom
the
mining
now
done
is
in
quartz
ledges
up
on
the
sides
of
grim
hills
i
was
back
in
the
land
of
rock
again
a
land
showing
the
forces
of
nature
in
high
points
of
foreign
rock
shot
up
from
beneath
penetrating
the
crust
of
the
earth
and
in
a
few
places
emerging
for
a
height
of
two
hundred
feet
from
the
river
itself
forming
barren
islands
and
great
circling
whirlpools
as
large
as
that
in
the
niagara
gorge
and
i
thought
for
a
while
almost
as
powerful
in
one
i
attempted
to
keep
to
the
short
side
of
the
river
but
found
it
a
difficult
job
and
one
which
took
three
times
as
long
to
accomplish
as
if
i
had
allowed
myself
to
be
carried
around
the
circle
then
the
land
became
level
again
and
the
chocolate
mountains
were
seen
to
the
west
a
hard
wind
blew
across
the
stream
so
that
i
had
to
drop
my
sunshade
to
prevent
being
carried
against
the
rocks
this
day
i
passed
a
large
irrigation
canal
leading
off
from
the
stream
the
second
such
on
the
entire
course
of
the
colorado
here
a
friendly
ranchman
called
to
me
from
the
shore
and
warned
me
of
the
laguna
dam
some
distance
below
he
said
the
water
was
backed
up
for
three
miles
so
i
would
know
when
i
was
approaching
it
in
spite
of
this
warning
i
nearly
came
to
grief
at
the
dam
the
wind
had
shifted
until
it
blew
directly
down
the
stream
the
river
nearly
a
mile
wide
still
ran
with
a
powerful
current
i
ceased
rowing
and
drifted
down
over
waves
much
like
those
one
would
find
on
a
lake
driven
by
a
heavy
wind
i
saw
some
high
poles
and
a
heavy
electric
cable
stretched
across
the
stream
and
concluded
that
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
dam
i
began
to
look
ahead
for
some
sign
of
a
barrier
across
the
stream
far
below
but
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
kind
then
as
i
neared
the
poles
it
suddenly
dawned
on
me
that
there
was
no
raised
barrier
which
diverted
all
the
water
through
a
sluice
but
a
submerged
dam
over
which
the
flood
poured
and
that
the
poles
were
on
that
dam
my
sunshade
was
dropped
as
quickly
as
i
could
do
it
and
grabbing
the
oars
i
began
to
pull
for
the
california
shore
it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
i
happened
to
be
comparatively
near
the
shore
when
i
began
rowing
as
it
was
i
landed
below
the
diverting
canal
and
about
a
hundred
yards
above
the
dam
on
examination
the
dam
proved
to
be
a
slope
about
fifty
feet
long
a
man
in
charge
of
the
machinery
controlling
the
gates
told
me
that
the
dam
lacked
seven
feet
of
being
a
mile
wide
and
that
approximately
seven
feet
of
water
was
going
over
the
entire
dam
great
cement
blocks
and
rocks
had
been
dropped
promiscuously
below
the
dam
to
prevent
it
from
being
undermined
even
without
the
rocks
it
was
doubtful
if
an
uncovered
boat
could
go
through
without
upsetting
the
great
force
of
the
water
made
a
trough
four
or
five
feet
lower
than
the
river
level
all
water
coming
down
the
slope
shooting
underneath
while
the
river
rolled
back
upstream
on
two
occasions
boatmen
had
been
carried
over
the
dam
in
each
case
the
boat
was
wrecked
but
the
occupants
were
thrown
out
and
escaped
uninjured
i
could
not
help
but
be
amused
and
feel
a
little
uncomfortable
too
when
i
saw
how
nearly
i
came
to
being
wrecked
here
after
having
escaped
that
fate
in
the
rapids
of
the
canyons
i
ran
my
boat
back
to
the
diverting
canal
then
rowed
down
to
the
massive
cement
gates
which
looked
to
me
like
a
small
replica
of
some
of
the
locks
on
the
panama
canal
with
the
help
of
an
indian
who
was
ready
for
a
job
my
boat
was
taken
out
rolled
around
the
buildings
on
some
sections
of
pipe
and
slid
over
the
bank
into
the
canal
below
the
gates
in
spite
of
a
desire
to
spend
some
time
inspecting
the
machinery
of
this
great
work
which
with
the
canal
and
other
improvements
had
cost
the
government
over
a
million
dollars
i
immediately
resumed
my
rowing
it
was
and
measured
by
the
canal
which
was
direct
it
was
twelve
miles
to
yuma
but
i
soon
learned
that
great
winding
curves
made
it
much
farther
by
the
river
in
some
cases
it
nearly
doubled
back
on
itself
the
wind
had
shifted
by
this
time
and
blew
against
me
so
hard
that
it
was
almost
useless
to
attempt
rowing
in
another
place
there
were
no
banks
and
the
water
had
spread
for
three
miles
in
broken
sloughs
and
around
islands
the
one
deep
channel
being
lost
in
the
maze
of
shallow
ones
with
these
things
to
contend
with
it
was
dusk
long
before
i
neared
the
town
the
twelve
miles
having
stretched
to
twenty
finally
i
saw
a
windmill
partly
submerged
some
distance
away
was
a
small
ranch
house
also
in
the
water
the
house
with
lights
in
the
upper
story
was
a
cheering
sight
the
windmill
looked
out
of
place
in
the
midst
of
all
this
desolation
of
water
soon
other
houses
appeared
with
lights
showing
through
the
windows
once
i
lost
my
way
and
spent
a
half
hour
in
getting
back
to
the
right
channel
somewhere
in
the
dark
i
never
knew
just
when
i
passed
the
mouth
of
the
gila
river
in
a
similar
way
in
broad
daylight
i
had
passed
the
bill
williams
fork
above
ahrenburg
at
last
i
neared
the
town
i
could
discern
some
buildings
on
top
of
a
small
hill
evidently
one
of
the
back
streets
of
yuma
after
tying
my
boat
i
hid
my
small
load
in
some
mesquite
trees
then
climbed
the
hill
and
passed
between
two
peculiar
stone
houses
dark
as
dungeons
they
puzzled
me
from
the
outside
but
when
once
past
them
i
was
no
longer
in
doubt
i
had
entered
the
open
gateway
leading
to
the
courtyard
of
the
yuma
penitentiary
no
wonder
the
buildings
looked
like
dungeons
this
was
a
new
experience
for
me
but
somehow
i
had
always
imagined
just
how
it
would
look
i
was
considering
beating
a
retreat
when
a
guard
hailed
me
and
asked
me
if
i
was
not
lost
with
the
assistance
of
the
guard
i
escaped
from
the
pen
and
found
my
way
to
the
streets
of
yuma
just
four
days
after
leaving
the
needles
bridge
chapter
xxvi
across
the
mexico
border
mexico
is
a
good
place
to
keep
away
from
just
at
present
this
was
the
invariable
answer
to
a
few
casual
inquiries
concerning
what
i
would
be
likely
to
meet
with
in
the
way
of
difficulties
a
possible
companion
for
the
voyage
to
the
gulf
and
how
one
could
get
back
when
once
there
i
received
little
encouragement
from
the
people
of
yuma
the
cautions
came
not
from
the
timid
who
see
danger
in
every
rumour
but
from
the
old
steamboat
captains
the
miners
and
prospectors
who
knew
the
country
and
had
interests
in
mineral
claims
across
the
border
these
claims
they
had
lost
in
many
cases
because
they
had
failed
for
the
last
two
years
to
keep
up
their
assessment
work
there
were
vague
suggestions
of
being
stood
up
against
an
adobe
wall
with
a
row
of
yaller
bellies
in
front
or
being
thrown
into
damp
dungeons
and
held
for
a
ransom
the
steamboat
men
could
give
me
little
information
about
the
river
the
old
channel
had
filled
with
silt
and
the
river
was
diverted
into
a
roundabout
course
little
more
than
a
creek
in
width
then
spread
over
whole
delta
the
widely
spread
water
finally
collected
into
an
ancient
course
of
the
colorado
known
as
the
hardy
or
false
colorado
as
nearly
as
i
could
learn
no
one
from
yuma
had
been
through
this
new
channel
beyond
a
certain
point
called
volcanic
lake
two
or
three
parties
had
come
back
with
stories
of
having
attempted
it
but
found
themselves
in
the
middle
of
a
with
insufficient
water
to
float
a
boat
with
a
desire
to
be
of
real
assistance
to
me
one
old
captain
called
a
yuma
indian
into
his
office
and
asked
him
his
opinion
suggesting
that
he
might
go
along
mebbe
so
get
lost
in
the
trees
mebbe
so
get
shot
by
the
cocopah
the
indian
replied
as
he
shook
his
head
the
captain
laughed
at
the
last
and
said
that
the
yuma
and
cocopah
indians
were
not
the
best
of
friends
and
accused
each
other
of
all
sorts
of
things
which
neither
had
committed
some
mexicans
and
certain
outlawed
whites
who
kept
close
to
the
border
for
different
reasons
and
the
possibilities
of
bogging
in
a
were
the
only
uncertainties
in
so
many
words
he
advised
me
against
going
still
i
persevered
i
had
planned
so
long
on
completing
my
boating
trip
to
the
gulf
that
i
disliked
to
abandon
the
idea
altogether
i
felt
sure
with
a
flood
on
the
colorado
there
would
be
some
channel
that
a
boat
could
go
through
when
travelling
with
the
current
but
the
return
trip
and
the
chances
of
being
made
a
target
for
some
hidden
native
who
had
lived
on
this
unfriendly
border
and
had
as
much
reason
for
respecting
some
citizens
of
the
united
states
as
our
own
indians
had
in
the
frontier
days
caused
me
considerable
concern
i
knew
it
was
customary
everywhere
to
make
much
of
the
imaginary
dangers
as
we
had
found
in
our
other
journeys
but
it
is
not
difficult
to
discriminate
between
sound
advice
and
the
croakings
which
are
based
on
lack
of
real
information
i
knew
this
was
sound
advice
and
as
usual
i
disliked
to
follow
it
at
last
i
got
some
encouragement
it
came
from
a
retired
wild
west
showman
the
real
thing
one
who
knew
the
west
from
its
early
days
he
laughed
at
the
idea
of
danger
and
said
i
was
not
likely
to
find
any
one
even
if
i
was
anxious
to
do
so
until
i
got
to
the
la
bolso
ranch
near
the
gulf
they
would
be
glad
to
see
me
he
thought
it
was
likely
to
prove
uninteresting
unless
i
intended
to
hunt
wild
hogs
but
that
was
useless
without
dogs
and
i
would
have
trouble
getting
a
gun
past
the
custom
officers
his
advice
was
to
talk
with
the
mexican
consul
as
he
might
know
some
one
who
could
bring
me
back
by
horseback
in
the
consul
i
found
a
young
spaniard
all
affability
bows
and
gestures
and
without
being
conscious
of
it
at
first
i
too
began
making
motions
he
deplored
my
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
spanish
language
laughed
at
any
suggestion
of
trouble
as
all
trouble
was
in
eastern
sonora
he
said
separated
from
the
coast
by
two
hundred
miles
of
desert
and
stated
that
the
owner
of
the
la
bolsa
cattle
ranch
happened
to
be
in
the
building
at
that
moment
in
a
twinkling
he
had
me
before
him
and
explained
the
situation
this
gentleman
the
owner
of
a
grant
and
the
fishing
concession
of
the
gulf
stated
that
the
ranch
drove
a
team
to
yuma
once
a
week
that
they
would
bring
me
back
in
the
interval
i
must
consider
myself
the
guest
of
the
rancho
la
bolsa
the
consul
gave
me
a
passport
and
so
it
was
all
arranged
in
spite
of
the
consul
opinion
there
were
many
whispered
rumours
of
war
of
silent
automobiles
loaded
with
firearms
that
stole
out
of
town
under
cover
of
the
night
and
returned
in
four
days
and
another
of
a
river
channel
that
could
be
followed
and
was
followed
the
start
being
made
not
from
yuma
but
from
another
border
town
farther
west
a
year
before
there
had
been
an
outbreak
at
this
place
of
certain
restless
spirits
some
whites
included
and
they
went
along
the
northern
line
of
mexico
sacking
the
ranches
and
terrorizing
the
people
the
la
bolsa
ranch
was
among
those
that
suffered
the
party
contained
some
discharged
vaqueros
who
were
anxious
to
interview
the
ranch
foreman
but
fortunately
for
him
he
was
absent
then
they
turned
south
to
chihuahua
and
joined
the
army
of
madero
war
to
them
meant
license
to
rob
and
kill
they
were
not
insurrectos
but
bandits
and
this
was
the
class
that
was
most
feared
meanwhile
i
had
not
given
up
the
idea
of
a
possible
companion
before
coming
to
yuma
i
had
entertained
hopes
of
getting
some
one
with
a
motor
boat
to
take
me
down
and
back
but
there
were
no
motor
boats
i
found
the
nearest
approach
to
a
power
boat
was
an
attempt
that
was
being
made
to
install
the
engine
from
a
wrecked
steam
auto
on
a
sort
of
scow
i
heard
of
this
boat
three
or
four
times
and
in
each
case
the
information
was
accompanied
by
a
smile
and
some
vague
remarks
about
a
hybrid
i
hunted
up
the
owner
the
proprietor
of
a
shooting
gallery
a
man
who
had
once
had
aspirations
as
a
prize
fighter
but
had
met
with
discouragement
so
he
had
turned
his
activities
to
teaching
the
young
idea
how
to
shoot
especially
the
mexican
idea
and
those
other
border
spirits
who
were
itching
for
a
scrap
the
proprietor
of
the
shooting
gallery
drove
a
thriving
trade
since
he
had
abandoned
his
training
he
had
taken
on
fat
and
i
found
him
to
be
a
genial
sort
of
giant
who
refused
to
concern
himself
with
the
serious
side
of
life
even
a
lacing
he
had
received
in
san
francisco
at
the
hands
of
a
negro
stevedore
struck
him
as
being
humorous
he
did
not
seem
to
have
much
more
confidence
in
his
power
boat
than
the
others
but
said
i
might
talk
with
the
man
who
was
putting
it
together
ending
with
the
remark
phillipps
thinks
he
can
make
her
run
and
he
has
always
talked
of
going
to
the
gulf
on
investigation
i
found
al
phillipps
was
anxious
to
go
to
the
gulf
and
would
go
along
if
i
would
wait
until
he
got
his
boat
in
shape
this
would
take
two
days
phillipps
as
he
told
me
himself
was
a
jayhawker
who
had
left
the
farm
in
kansas
and
had
gone
to
sea
for
two
years
he
was
a
cowboy
but
had
worked
a
year
or
two
about
mining
engines
in
yuma
he
was
a
carpenter
but
was
anxious
to
leave
and
go
prospecting
along
the
gulf
phillipps
and
i
were
sure
to
have
an
interesting
time
he
spoke
spanish
and
did
not
fear
any
of
the
previously
mentioned
dangers
he
had
heard
of
one
party
being
carried
out
to
sea
when
the
tide
rushed
out
of
the
river
but
as
we
would
have
low
tide
he
thought
that
with
caution
we
could
avoid
that
at
last
all
was
ready
for
the
momentous
trial
the
river
bank
was
lined
with
a
crowd
of
men
who
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
leisure
some
yuma
indians
and
red
and
green
turbaned
papagos
gathered
in
a
group
off
a
little
to
one
side
a
number
of
darkies
were
fishing
for
bullheads
and
boys
of
three
colors
besides
the
mexicans
and
a
lone
chinaman
clambered
over
the
trees
and
the
boats
along
the
shore
it
was
a
moment
of
suspense
for
phillipps
his
reputation
as
an
engineer
and
a
constructor
of
boats
hung
in
the
balance
he
also
had
some
original
ideas
about
a
rudder
which
had
been
incorporated
in
this
boat
now
was
his
chance
to
test
them
out
and
his
hour
of
triumph
if
they
worked
the
test
was
a
rigid
one
the
boat
was
to
be
turned
upstream
against
an
current
with
big
beginning
about
sixty
feet
from
the
shore
running
in
the
middle
of
the
river
if
the
engine
ran
and
the
stern
turned
his
reputation
was
saved
if
she
was
powerful
enough
to
go
against
the
current
it
was
a
triumph
and
we
would
start
for
the
gulf
at
once
on
board
were
phillipps
a
volunteer
and
myself
before
turning
the
boat
loose
the
engine
was
tried
it
was
a
success
the
churned
the
water
at
a
great
rate
sending
the
boat
upstream
as
far
as
the
ropes
would
let
her
go
we
would
try
a
preliminary
run
in
the
quiet
water
close
to
the
shore
before
making
the
test
in
the
swift
current
the
order
was
given
to
cast
off
and
for
two
men
the
owner
and
another
to
hold
to
the
ropes
and
follow
on
the
shore
the
engine
was
started
the
revolved
slowly
at
first
but
gathering
speed
with
each
revolution
we
began
to
move
gently
then
faster
so
that
the
men
on
shore
had
difficulty
in
keeping
even
with
us
impeded
as
they
were
with
bushes
and
sloping
banks
flushed
with
success
the
order
was
given
to
turn
her
loose
and
we
gathered
in
the
ropes
now
we
were
drifting
away
from
the
shore
and
making
some
headway
against
the
swift
current
the
crowd
on
shore
was
left
behind
but
as
we
left
the
bank
the
river
increased
in
speed
and
the
boat
gradually
lost
then
she
stood
still
but
began
to
turn
slowly
broadside
to
the
current
this
was
something
we
had
not
foreseen
with
no
headway
the
rudder
was
of
no
avail
there
was
no
we
had
even
neglected
to
put
an
oar
on
the
boat
with
pieces
of
boards
the
stranger
and
i
paddled
trying
to
hold
her
straight
but
all
the
time
in
spite
of
our
efforts
she
drifted
away
from
the
land
and
slowly
turned
a
big
struck
her
she
wheeled
in
her
tracks
and
raced
straight
for
a
pier
down
the
stream
about
this
time
our
engineer
began
having
trouble
with
his
engine
at
first
we
feared
it
would
not
run
now
it
seemed
it
would
not
stop
a
great
shout
went
up
from
the
shore
and
a
bet
was
made
that
we
would
run
to
the
gulf
in
less
than
a
day
a
darky
boy
fell
off
a
boat
in
the
excitement
the
indians
did
a
dance
men
pounded
each
other
and
whooped
for
joy
then
a
bolt
came
loose
and
the
engine
ran
away
and
belts
were
whirled
regardless
as
the
passenger
afterwards
said
about
our
heads
then
the
crash
came
our
efforts
to
escape
the
pier
were
of
no
avail
i
made
a
puny
effort
to
break
the
impact
with
a
pole
but
was
sent
sprawling
on
the
deck
al
tumbled
headlong
on
top
of
the
engine
which
he
had
stopped
at
last
our
passenger
rolled
over
and
over
but
we
all
stayed
with
the
ship
each
grabbing
a
board
we
began
to
paddle
and
steered
the
craft
to
the
shore
with
the
excitement
over
the
crowd
faded
away
only
two
or
three
willing
hands
remained
to
help
us
line
the
craft
back
to
the
landing
the
owner
who
had
to
run
around
the
end
of
the
bridge
came
down
puffing
and
blowing
badly
winded
at
the
end
of
the
first
round
without
a
word
from
any
one
we
brought
the
boat
back
to
the
landing
al
was
the
first
to
speak
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
me
i
going
to
take
my
boat
and
start
for
the
gulf
in
ten
minutes
i
take
nothing
that
i
can
not
carry
if
i
have
to
leave
the
river
i
will
travel
light
across
the
desert
to
calexico
i
think
that
i
can
get
through
if
you
want
to
go
along
i
stick
with
you
until
we
get
back
what
do
you
think
about
it
it
was
a
long
speech
and
a
little
bitter
perhaps
i
felt
that
way
the
disappointment
on
top
of
the
three
days
delay
when
time
was
precious
could
not
be
forgotten
in
a
moment
and
when
my
speech
was
said
i
was
all
through
al
said
he
would
be
ready
in
half
an
hour
our
beds
were
left
behind
al
had
a
square
of
canvas
for
a
sail
this
would
be
sufficient
covering
at
night
in
the
hot
desert
we
had
two
canteens
the
provisions
scarcely
touched
before
arriving
here
were
sufficient
for
five
days
i
was
so
anxious
to
get
started
that
i
did
not
take
the
time
to
replenish
them
in
yuma
intending
to
do
so
at
the
on
the
arizona
side
twelve
miles
below
where
some
one
had
told
me
there
was
a
store
i
counted
on
camping
there
after
a
hurriedly
eaten
luncheon
we
were
ready
to
start
the
boat
was
shoved
off
and
we
were
embarked
for
mexico
half
an
hour
later
we
passed
the
abandoned
imperial
canal
the
channel
which
had
nearly
destroyed
the
vast
agricultural
lands
which
it
had
in
turn
created
just
such
a
flood
as
that
on
which
we
were
travelling
had
torn
out
the
insufficiently
supported
the
entire
stream
instead
of
pushing
slowly
across
the
delta
weltering
in
its
own
silt
to
the
gulf
poured
into
the
bottom
of
the
basin
nearly
four
hundred
feet
below
the
top
of
this
dam
in
a
single
night
it
cut
an
channel
in
the
unyielding
soil
and
what
had
once
been
the
northern
end
of
the
california
gulf
was
turned
into
an
inland
sea
filled
with
the
turbid
waters
of
the
colorado
instead
of
the
sparkling
waters
of
the
ocean
nothing
but
an
almost
superhuman
fight
finally
rescued
the
land
from
the
grip
of
the
water
a
short
distance
below
just
across
the
mexican
line
on
the
california
side
was
the
new
canal
dug
in
a
firmer
soil
and
with
strongly
built
gates
anchored
in
rock
back
from
the
river
half
a
mile
away
from
the
stream
on
a
spur
railway
was
the
mexican
i
had
imagined
that
it
would
be
beside
the
river
and
that
guards
would
be
seen
patrolling
the
shore
but
aside
from
an
indian
fishing
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
we
walked
out
to
the
gave
a
list
of
the
few
things
which
we
had
assured
them
that
we
carried
no
guns
paid
our
duty
and
departed
we
had
imagined
that
our
boat
would
be
inspected
but
no
one
came
near
the
border
line
makes
a
jog
here
at
the
river
and
the
line
was
still
a
few
miles
down
the
stream
we
had
passed
the
mouth
of
the
old
colorado
channel
which
flowed
a
little
west
of
south
and
we
turned
instead
to
the
west
into
the
spreading
delta
or
moraine
about
this
time
i
remarked
that
i
had
seen
no
store
at
the
and
that
i
must
not
neglect
to
get
provisions
at
the
next
one
or
we
would
be
rather
short
we
passed
our
last
back
there
al
replied
likely
the
last
place
we
will
see
until
we
get
to
the
ranch
by
the
gulf
no
no
store
this
was
a
surprise
what
was
a
border
for
if
not
to
have
and
inspectors
with
all
the
talk
of
smuggling
i
had
not
thought
of
anything
else
and
i
could
tell
by
tone
that
his
estimation
of
my
foresight
had
dropped
several
degrees
this
was
only
natural
for
his
disappointment
and
the
jibes
still
rankled
at
last
we
were
wholly
in
mexican
territory
with
the
states
behind
all
of
our
swiftly
running
water
had
departed
and
we
now
travelled
on
a
stream
that
was
nearly
stagnant
all
the
cottonwood
logs
which
had
finally
been
carried
down
the
stream
after
having
been
deposited
on
a
hundred
shores
found
here
their
final
resting
place
about
each
cluster
of
logs
an
island
was
forming
covered
with
a
rank
grass
and
tules
ramified
channels
wound
here
and
there
two
or
three
times
we
found
ourselves
in
a
shallow
channel
and
with
some
difficulty
retraced
our
way
all
channels
looked
alike
but
only
one
was
deep
then
the
willow
trees
which
were
far
distant
on
either
shore
began
to
close
in
and
we
travelled
in
a
channel
not
more
than
a
hundred
feet
wide
growing
smaller
with
every
mile
this
new
channel
is
sometimes
termed
the
bee
river
it
parallels
the
northern
mexico
line
it
also
parallels
a
mile
levee
which
the
united
states
government
has
constructed
along
the
northern
edge
of
this
wide
dam
shoved
across
the
california
gulf
by
the
stream
building
higher
every
year
except
for
the
river
channel
the
dam
may
be
said
to
reach
unbroken
from
the
mesa
to
the
cocopah
mountains
the
levee
runs
from
a
point
of
rocks
near
the
river
to
lone
mountain
a
solitary
peak
some
distance
east
of
the
main
range
this
levee
built
since
the
trouble
with
the
canal
is
all
that
prevents
the
water
from
breaking
into
the
basin
in
a
dozen
places
we
saw
signs
of
two
or
three
close
to
the
stream
and
with
the
memory
of
the
stories
haunting
us
a
little
we
built
only
a
small
fire
when
we
cooked
our
evening
meal
then
extinguished
it
and
camped
on
a
dry
point
of
land
a
mile
or
two
below
i
think
we
were
both
a
little
nervous
that
night
i
confess
that
i
was
and
if
an
unwashed
individual
had
poked
his
head
out
from
the
willows
and
said
woof
or
whatever
it
is
that
they
say
when
they
want
to
start
up
a
we
would
both
have
stampeded
clear
across
the
border
in
fact
i
felt
a
little
as
i
did
when
i
played
truant
from
school
and
wondered
what
would
happen
when
i
was
found
out
daybreak
found
us
ready
to
resume
our
journey
and
with
a
rising
sun
any
nervousness
vanished
what
could
any
one
want
with
two
men
who
had
nothing
but
a
boat
all
the
morning
we
travelled
west
the
trees
ever
drawing
closer
as
our
water
departed
on
the
south
running
through
the
willows
and
then
the
channel
opened
into
volcanic
lake
a
circular
body
of
water
which
is
not
a
lake
but
simply
a
gathering
together
of
the
streams
we
had
been
losing
and
here
the
water
stands
depositing
its
mud
all
the
way
across
had
no
depth
but
a
bottomless
mud
so
soft
it
would
engulf
a
person
if
he
tried
to
wade
across
on
the
west
there
was
no
growth
the
shore
was
nothing
but
an
powder
not
a
sand
but
a
rich
soil
blown
here
and
there
building
in
dunes
against
every
obstruction
ever
moving
before
the
wind
here
were
boiling
sputtering
mud
pots
and
steam
vents
building
up
and
exhausting
through
mud
rising
a
foot
or
two
above
the
springs
here
was
a
shelter
or
two
of
boards
constructed
by
those
who
come
here
crippled
with
rheumatism
and
are
supposed
to
depart
cured
here
we
saw
signs
of
a
wagon
track
driven
toward
calexico
the
border
town
directly
north
of
the
lake
the
heat
was
scorching
the
sun
reflected
from
the
sand
and
water
was
blistering
and
we
could
well
imagine
what
a
walk
across
that
soil
would
mean
mirages
in
the
distance
beckoned
trees
and
lakes
were
seen
over
toward
the
mountains
where
we
had
seen
nothing
but
desert
before
heat
waves
rose
and
fell
our
mouths
began
to
puff
from
the
reflected
sun
our
faces
burned
and
peeled
black
and
red
in
spots
there
was
no
indication
of
the
slightest
breeze
until
about
three
when
the
wind
moved
gently
across
the
lake
we
had
skirted
the
northern
part
of
the
circle
passing
a
few
small
streams
and
then
found
one
of
the
three
large
channels
which
empty
the
lake
as
it
happened
we
took
the
one
on
the
outside
and
the
longest
the
growth
grew
thicker
than
ever
the
stream
choked
down
to
fifty
feet
now
it
began
to
loop
backward
and
forward
and
back
again
as
though
trying
to
make
the
longest
and
crookedest
channel
possible
in
the
smallest
space
the
water
in
the
channel
was
stagnant
swift
streamlets
rushed
in
from
the
tules
on
the
north
and
rushed
out
again
on
the
south
it
was
not
always
a
simple
matter
to
ascertain
which
was
the
main
channel
others
just
as
large
were
diverted
from
the
stream
twice
we
attempted
to
cut
across
but
the
water
became
shallow
the
tules
stalled
our
boats
and
we
were
glad
to
return
sounding
with
a
pole
when
in
doubt
then
we
began
to
realize
that
we
were
not
entirely
alone
in
this
wilderness
of
water
we
saw
evidence
of
another
passage
in
broken
and
blazed
trees
in
many
places
he
had
pushed
into
the
thickets
we
concluded
it
must
be
a
trapper
at
last
to
our
surprise
we
saw
a
telephone
equipment
sheltered
in
a
box
nailed
on
a
tree
the
line
ran
directly
across
the
stream
here
also
we
could
see
where
a
boat
had
forced
a
way
through
and
the
water
plants
had
been
cut
with
a
sharp
instrument
what
could
it
be
we
were
certain
no
line
ran
to
the
only
ranch
at
the
gulf
we
had
information
of
another
ranch
directly
on
the
border
line
but
did
not
think
it
came
below
the
levee
and
as
far
as
we
had
learned
there
were
no
homes
but
the
wickiups
of
the
cocopah
in
the
jungles
it
was
like
one
of
those
thrilling
stories
of
old
sleuth
and
dead
shot
dick
which
we
read
concealed
in
our
schoolbooks
when
we
were
supposed
to
be
studying
the
physical
geography
of
mexico
but
the
telephone
was
no
fiction
and
had
recently
been
repaired
but
for
what
purpose
it
was
there
we
could
not
imagine
after
leaving
the
lake
there
was
no
dry
land
at
night
our
boat
filled
with
green
tules
for
a
bed
was
tied
to
a
willow
tree
with
its
roots
submerged
in
ten
feet
of
water
never
were
there
such
swarms
of
mosquitos
in
the
morning
our
faces
were
corrugated
with
lumps
not
a
single
exposed
spot
remaining
unbitten
the
loops
continued
with
the
next
day
travel
but
we
were
gradually
working
to
the
southwest
then
they
began
to
straighten
out
somewhat
as
the
diverted
streams
returned
we
thought
early
in
the
morning
that
we
would
pass
about
ten
miles
to
the
east
of
the
coast
range
but
it
was
not
to
be
directly
to
the
base
of
the
dark
rocks
we
pulled
and
landed
on
the
first
shore
that
we
had
seen
for
hours
here
was
a
recently
used
trail
and
tracks
where
horses
came
down
to
the
water
here
too
was
the
track
of
a
barefooted
cocopah
a
tribe
noted
for
its
men
of
gigantic
build
and
with
great
feet
out
of
all
proportion
to
their
size
if
that
footprint
was
to
be
fossilized
future
generations
would
marvel
at
the
evidence
of
some
gigantic
prehistoric
animal
an
alligator
with
a
foot
these
indians
have
lived
in
these
mud
bottoms
so
long
crossing
the
streams
on
rafts
made
of
bundles
of
tules
and
only
going
to
the
higher
land
when
their
homes
are
inundated
by
the
floods
that
they
have
become
a
near
approach
to
a
human
being
our
stream
merely
touched
the
mountain
then
turned
directly
to
the
southeast
in
a
gradually
increasing
stream
now
we
began
to
see
the
breeding
places
of
the
of
which
we
had
heard
there
was
a
confusion
of
bird
calls
cranes
were
everywhere
in
some
cases
with
five
nests
in
a
single
tree
a
blue
heron
flopped
around
as
though
it
had
broken
a
wing
to
decoy
us
from
its
nest
the
snowy
white
pelican
waddled
along
the
banks
and
mingled
with
the
cormorants
there
were
great
numbers
of
gulls
and
occasional
snipe
we
were
too
late
to
see
the
ducks
which
come
here
literally
by
the
million
during
the
winter
months
there
were
nests
in
the
same
groups
of
trees
as
the
cranes
with
the
young
hawks
stretching
their
necks
for
the
food
which
was
to
be
had
in
such
abundance
and
on
another
tree
sat
the
parent
hawks
complacently
looking
over
the
nests
of
the
other
birds
like
a
coyote
waiting
for
a
horse
to
die
at
cocopah
mountain
a
golden
eagle
soared
coming
down
close
to
the
ground
as
we
rested
under
the
mesquite
then
as
we
travelled
clear
streams
of
water
began
to
pour
in
from
the
north
and
east
those
same
streams
we
had
lost
above
but
cleared
entirely
of
their
silt
now
the
willows
grew
scarce
and
instead
of
mud
banks
a
dry
firm
earth
was
built
up
from
the
river
edge
and
the
stream
increased
in
size
soon
it
was
six
or
seven
hundred
feet
wide
and
running
with
a
fair
current
this
was
the
hardy
river
we
noticed
signs
of
falling
water
on
the
banks
as
though
the
stream
had
dropped
an
inch
or
two
in
a
the
mark
indicated
a
fall
of
eight
inches
or
more
then
we
realized
we
were
going
out
with
the
tide
a
taste
of
water
proved
it
the
river
water
was
well
mixed
with
a
weak
saline
solution
we
filled
our
canteens
at
once
we
saw
a
small
building
and
a
flagpole
on
the
south
shore
but
on
nearing
the
place
found
it
was
deserted
a
few
miles
below
were
two
other
channels
equally
as
large
as
that
on
which
we
travelled
evidently
fed
by
streams
similar
to
our
own
there
were
numerous
scattered
trees
some
of
them
cottonwood
and
we
saw
some
grazing
cattle
we
began
to
look
for
the
ranch
house
which
some
one
had
said
was
at
the
point
where
the
colorado
and
the
hardy
joined
and
which
others
told
us
was
at
the
gulf
chapter
xxvii
the
gulf
of
california
that
the
head
of
the
gulf
of
california
has
a
big
tide
is
well
known
choked
in
a
narrowing
cone
the
waters
rise
higher
and
higher
as
they
come
to
the
apex
reaching
feet
or
over
in
a
high
tide
this
causes
a
tidal
bore
to
roll
up
the
colorado
and
from
all
reports
it
was
something
to
be
avoided
the
earliest
spanish
explorers
told
some
wonderful
tales
of
being
caught
in
this
bore
and
of
nearly
losing
their
little
sailing
vessels
this
was
my
first
experience
with
river
tides
it
was
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
to
me
that
i
could
not
arrange
to
be
here
at
a
high
tide
for
we
had
come
at
the
first
quarter
of
the
moon
out
on
the
open
sea
one
can
usually
make
some
headway
by
rowing
against
the
ebb
or
flow
of
the
tide
here
on
the
colorado
where
it
flowed
upstream
at
a
rate
of
from
five
to
eight
miles
an
hour
it
was
different
when
we
reached
the
head
of
the
tide
it
was
going
out
unfortunately
for
us
the
day
was
gone
when
the
current
began
to
run
strong
it
hardly
seemed
advisable
to
travel
with
it
after
dark
we
might
pass
the
ranch
or
be
carried
against
a
coast
or
find
difficulty
in
landing
and
be
overwhelmed
by
the
tidal
bore
so
when
darkness
fell
we
camped
pulling
our
boat
out
in
a
little
slough
to
prevent
it
from
being
carried
away
evidently
we
were
too
near
the
headwaters
for
a
tidal
bore
for
at
eleven
the
waters
turned
and
came
back
as
quietly
as
they
ran
out
we
launched
our
boat
before
the
break
of
day
and
for
four
hours
we
travelled
on
a
good
current
the
channel
now
had
widened
to
a
with
straight
earthy
banks
about
fifteen
feet
high
still
there
was
no
sign
of
a
ranch
and
it
began
to
look
to
us
as
if
there
was
little
likelihood
of
finding
any
the
land
was
nearly
level
and
except
for
a
few
raised
hummocks
on
which
grew
some
scattered
trees
it
was
quite
bare
this
was
not
only
because
it
did
not
get
the
water
from
the
north
but
because
at
times
it
was
submerged
under
the
saline
waters
from
the
south
near
the
shores
of
the
river
and
extending
back
for
fifty
feet
was
a
matted
rank
growth
of
grass
beyond
that
the
earth
was
bare
baked
and
cracked
by
the
burning
sun
this
grass
we
found
was
a
favorite
resort
of
rattlesnakes
we
killed
two
of
them
a
large
one
and
a
vicious
little
sidewinder
all
this
land
was
the
south
rim
of
the
silt
dam
which
extended
from
the
line
of
cliffs
or
mesa
on
the
east
to
the
mountains
on
the
west
the
other
rim
a
hundred
feet
higher
lay
at
least
fifty
miles
to
the
north
here
was
the
of
a
small
portion
of
the
sediment
carved
away
by
the
colorado
floods
how
deep
it
is
piled
and
how
far
it
extends
out
under
the
waters
of
the
gulf
would
be
hard
to
say
we
felt
sure
that
we
would
get
to
the
gulf
with
this
tide
but
when
the
time
came
for
it
to
turn
we
were
still
many
miles
away
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
camp
out
on
this
plain
we
stopped
a
little
after
now
that
we
were
nearing
the
gulf
we
were
sure
there
would
be
a
tidal
bore
as
we
breakfasted
a
slight
rushing
sound
was
heard
and
what
appeared
to
be
a
ripple
of
broken
water
or
small
breaker
came
up
the
stream
and
passed
on
this
was
a
disappointment
with
high
water
on
the
river
and
with
a
low
tide
this
was
all
the
tidal
bore
we
would
see
in
four
hours
the
water
rose
fourteen
feet
then
for
two
hours
the
rise
was
slower
within
three
feet
of
the
level
it
came
the
opposite
side
rounded
at
the
edges
looked
like
a
thread
on
top
of
the
water
tapered
to
a
single
silken
strand
and
looking
toward
the
gulf
merged
into
the
water
to
all
appearances
it
was
a
placid
lake
spread
from
mountain
to
mesa
our
smaller
canteen
was
still
filled
with
the
fresh
water
secured
the
evening
before
the
other
had
been
emptied
and
was
filled
again
before
the
return
of
the
tide
but
considerable
taste
of
the
salt
remained
what
we
did
now
must
be
done
with
caution
so
far
we
had
not
seen
the
ranch
we
were
in
doubt
whether
it
was
somewhere
out
on
the
coast
or
back
on
one
of
the
sloughs
passed
the
evening
before
we
had
heard
of
large
being
hauled
from
yuma
and
launched
by
the
ranch
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
it
was
somewhere
on
the
gulf
we
had
provisions
sufficient
for
one
day
one
canteen
of
fresh
water
and
another
so
mixed
with
the
salt
water
that
we
would
not
use
it
except
as
a
last
resort
a
little
after
the
tide
changed
we
launched
our
boat
and
went
out
with
the
flood
as
we
neared
the
mouth
of
the
stream
we
found
that
the
inrush
and
outrush
of
water
had
torn
the
banks
here
the
river
spread
in
a
circular
pool
several
miles
across
it
seemed
almost
as
if
the
waters
ran
clear
to
the
line
of
yellow
cliffs
and
to
the
hazy
mountain
range
then
the
shores
closed
in
again
just
before
the
current
divided
quite
evenly
on
either
side
of
a
section
of
the
barren
plain
named
montague
island
we
took
the
channel
to
the
east
our
last
hope
of
finding
the
ranch
was
in
a
river
channel
overgrown
with
trees
but
although
we
looked
carefully
as
we
passed
there
was
no
sign
of
a
trail
or
of
human
life
some
egrets
preened
their
silken
feathers
on
the
bank
cranes
and
two
coyotes
fat
as
hogs
and
dragging
tails
weighted
with
mud
feasted
on
the
lively
which
they
extracted
from
their
holes
and
that
was
all
the
sun
just
above
the
mountains
hung
like
a
great
suspended
ball
of
fire
the
cloudless
sky
glared
like
a
furnace
deep
purple
shadows
crept
into
the
canyons
slashing
the
mountain
range
the
yellow
and
the
mirages
disappeared
with
the
going
down
of
the
sun
still
we
were
carried
on
and
on
we
would
go
down
with
the
tide
now
the
end
of
the
island
lay
opposite
the
line
of
cliffs
soon
we
would
be
in
the
gulf
so
ended
the
colorado
two
thousand
miles
above
it
was
a
beautiful
river
born
of
a
hundred
peaks
and
a
thousand
crystal
streams
gathering
strength
it
became
the
masterful
river
which
had
carved
the
hearts
of
mountains
and
slashed
the
rocky
plateaus
draining
a
kingdom
and
giving
but
little
in
return
now
it
was
going
under
but
it
was
fighting
to
the
end
waves
of
yellow
struggled
up
through
waves
of
green
and
were
beaten
down
again
the
dorsal
fins
of
a
sharks
cut
circles
near
our
craft
with
the
last
afterglow
we
were
past
the
end
of
the
island
and
were
nearing
the
brooding
cliffs
still
the
current
ran
strong
the
last
vestige
of
day
was
swallowed
in
the
gloom
just
as
the
colorado
was
buried
the
blue
a
hard
wind
was
blowing
toward
the
shore
the
sea
was
choppy
a
point
of
rocks
where
the
cliffs
met
the
sea
was
our
goal
would
we
never
reach
it
even
in
the
night
which
was
now
upon
us
the
distance
was
deceptive
at
last
we
neared
the
pile
of
rocks
the
sound
of
waters
pounding
on
the
shore
was
heard
and
we
hurriedly
landed
a
above
it
just
as
the
tide
turned
the
beach
was
a
wide
covered
with
mud
and
sloughs
there
was
no
high
shore
but
an
examination
showed
that
the
tide
ran
back
to
the
cliffs
one
of
us
had
to
stay
with
the
boat
telling
phillipps
to
get
what
sleep
he
could
i
sat
in
the
boat
and
allowed
the
small
breakers
which
each
other
to
beat
it
in
as
the
tide
rose
an
arctic
explorer
has
said
that
having
an
adventure
means
that
something
unexpected
or
unforeseen
has
happened
that
some
one
has
been
incompetent
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
the
fault
of
this
adventure
if
such
it
could
be
called
was
mine
here
we
were
at
our
goal
in
mexico
supposed
to
be
a
hostile
land
with
scant
provisions
for
one
day
it
was
a
hundred
miles
along
the
line
of
cliffs
back
to
yuma
so
far
we
had
failed
to
find
the
ranch
it
was
not
likely
that
it
was
around
the
point
of
rocks
we
knew
now
that
the
colorado
channel
was
fifteen
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
was
not
a
slough
as
we
had
supposed
doubtless
the
ranch
was
up
there
our
best
plan
was
to
return
to
the
head
of
the
tide
going
up
the
colorado
then
if
we
did
not
find
the
ranch
we
would
abandon
the
boat
snare
some
birds
keep
out
of
the
scorching
heat
and
travel
in
the
morning
and
evening
two
active
men
should
be
able
to
do
that
without
difficulty
so
the
hours
passed
with
the
breakers
driving
the
boat
toward
the
line
of
cliffs
when
it
had
reached
its
highest
point
i
pulled
into
a
slough
and
tied
up
then
woke
al
as
we
had
agreed
while
i
slept
he
climbed
the
cliffs
to
have
a
last
look
an
hour
after
daybreak
he
returned
nothing
but
rock
and
desert
could
be
seen
we
dragged
the
boat
down
in
the
slime
of
the
slough
until
we
caught
the
falling
tide
then
al
rigged
up
his
sail
with
the
rising
sun
a
light
breeze
blew
in
from
the
gulf
here
was
our
opportunity
slowly
we
went
up
against
the
falling
tide
then
as
the
breeze
failed
the
tide
returned
fifty
feet
away
a
six
foot
black
sea
bass
floated
his
rounded
back
lifted
above
the
water
with
the
approach
of
the
boat
he
was
gone
the
sharks
were
seen
again
two
hours
later
we
had
entered
the
mouth
of
the
river
carried
by
the
rising
tide
several
miles
were
left
behind
another
breeze
came
up
as
the
tide
failed
and
the
sail
was
rigged
up
again
things
were
coming
our
way
at
last
al
knew
how
to
handle
a
boat
running
her
in
close
to
the
top
of
the
straight
falling
banks
i
could
leap
to
the
land
take
a
picture
then
run
and
overtake
the
boat
and
leap
on
again
then
the
wind
shifted
the
tide
turned
and
we
tied
up
directly
opposite
the
point
where
we
had
camped
the
afternoon
before
it
was
the
hottest
day
we
had
seen
whirlwinds
gathering
the
dust
in
slender
funnels
scurried
across
the
plains
mirages
of
trees
bordering
shimmering
lakes
and
spreading
water
such
as
we
had
come
through
below
yuma
were
to
be
seen
even
out
towards
the
sea
then
over
toward
the
cliffs
where
the
old
colorado
once
ran
we
saw
a
column
of
distant
smoke
perhaps
it
was
a
hunter
it
could
hardly
be
the
ranch
as
we
could
do
nothing
with
the
boat
we
concluded
to
walk
over
that
way
it
was
many
miles
distant
taking
everything
we
had
including
our
last
lunch
we
started
our
walk
leaving
a
cloth
on
a
pole
to
mark
the
point
where
our
boat
was
anchored
but
after
going
four
miles
it
still
seemed
no
nearer
than
before
so
we
returned
it
was
evening
the
water
was
drinkable
again
that
was
something
to
be
thankful
for
by
ten
that
night
the
tide
would
come
up
again
after
dark
we
found
that
our
boat
was
being
beached
so
we
ran
it
down
and
began
pulling
it
along
over
a
shoal
reaching
far
out
from
the
shore
as
we
tugged
i
was
sure
i
heard
a
call
somewhere
up
the
river
what
kind
of
a
land
was
this
could
it
be
that
my
senses
were
all
deceiving
me
as
my
eyes
were
fooled
by
the
mirage
i
had
heard
it
al
had
not
and
laughed
when
i
said
that
i
had
we
listened
and
heard
it
again
plainly
this
time
ca
you
men
find
a
landing
we
have
a
good
one
up
here
it
said
we
asked
them
to
row
down
advising
them
to
keep
clear
of
the
shoal
we
waded
out
guided
by
their
voices
in
the
pitch
darkness
and
neared
the
boat
one
shadowy
form
sat
in
either
end
of
a
boat
there
was
a
mast
and
the
boat
was
fitted
for
two
oarsmen
as
well
evidently
the
load
was
heavy
for
it
was
well
down
in
the
water
the
sail
cloth
was
spread
over
all
the
boat
excepting
one
end
where
there
was
a
small
stove
with
a
pan
of
glowing
wood
coal
underneath
the
aroma
of
coffee
came
from
a
pot
on
the
stove
as
i
steadied
myself
at
the
bow
i
touched
a
crumpled
flag
mexican
i
thought
but
i
could
not
see
both
figures
sat
facing
us
with
rifles
in
their
hands
alert
and
ready
for
a
surprise
smugglers
i
thought
guns
i
imagined
they
could
not
see
our
faces
in
the
dark
neither
could
we
distinguish
theirs
judging
by
their
voices
they
were
young
men
i
thought
from
the
first
that
they
were
mexicans
but
they
talked
without
accent
they
could
see
that
we
carried
no
arms
but
their
vigilance
was
not
relaxed
they
asked
what
our
trouble
was
and
we
told
them
of
the
beached
boat
what
we
had
been
doing
and
why
we
were
there
they
said
they
were
out
for
a
little
trip
down
in
the
gulf
they
might
go
to
tiburone
island
one
of
them
wondered
if
it
was
true
that
the
natives
were
cannibals
he
said
he
would
not
care
about
being
shot
but
he
would
hate
to
be
put
in
their
we
asked
them
how
much
water
they
carried
a
keg
was
all
they
hoped
to
get
more
along
the
coast
it
is
quite
well
known
there
is
none
they
professed
to
be
uninformed
about
the
country
did
not
know
there
was
a
ranch
or
a
tidal
bore
and
thanked
us
for
our
information
about
the
tides
and
the
advice
to
fill
their
keg
when
the
water
was
lowest
which
would
be
in
half
an
hour
they
could
not
sell
any
provisions
but
gave
us
a
quart
of
flour
as
we
talked
an
undermined
bank
toppled
over
sounding
like
shots
from
a
gun
one
cocked
his
rifle
on
the
impulse
then
laughed
when
he
realized
what
it
was
just
before
we
parted
one
of
them
remarked
you
came
through
the
bee
river
four
days
ago
near
a
telephone
you
yes
but
we
did
see
any
one
i
replied
no
but
we
saw
you
and
we
felt
the
smiles
we
could
not
see
they
said
the
large
ranch
had
some
chinamen
clearing
the
highest
ground
and
building
levees
around
it
to
keep
the
water
out
the
telephone
and
a
motor
boat
connected
the
different
ranches
their
advice
to
us
was
to
keep
to
the
river
not
to
look
for
the
ranch
but
to
get
on
the
telephone
and
raise
a
racket
until
some
one
showed
up
then
we
parted
to
go
to
our
respective
landings
with
mutual
wishes
for
a
successful
journey
the
boat
was
pulled
down
the
tide
was
on
the
point
of
turning
but
it
would
be
an
hour
before
there
would
be
any
strength
to
it
i
went
to
shore
and
built
a
fire
of
some
driftwood
for
the
long
stand
in
the
water
had
chilled
me
al
stayed
with
the
boat
earlier
in
the
day
i
cautiously
shook
the
sticks
loose
from
the
matted
grass
fearing
the
rattlers
which
were
everywhere
in
this
case
nothing
buzzed
but
i
had
no
sooner
got
my
fire
well
started
when
a
rattler
began
to
sing
roused
by
the
light
and
the
heat
about
twenty
feet
away
my
fire
was
built
beside
one
of
the
many
sloughs
which
cut
back
through
the
grass
and
ended
in
the
barren
soil
these
sloughs
were
filled
with
water
when
the
tide
was
in
and
made
ideal
landing
places
especially
if
one
had
to
avoid
a
big
tidal
bore
getting
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
i
tossed
a
stick
occasionally
to
keep
him
roused
soon
another
joined
and
between
them
they
made
the
air
hum
by
this
time
i
was
thoroughly
warmed
and
felt
that
the
boat
would
be
the
best
place
for
me
carefully
extinguishing
my
fire
i
went
down
to
the
river
just
as
the
tide
returned
without
any
sign
or
call
from
the
shore
we
were
carried
up
with
the
tide
we
were
both
weary
but
i
dared
not
sleep
so
i
merely
kept
the
boat
away
from
the
shores
and
drifted
while
phillipps
slept
i
had
picked
out
a
guiding
star
which
i
little
needed
while
the
current
was
running
strong
but
which
would
give
us
our
course
when
the
tide
changed
for
we
could
be
carried
out
just
as
easily
but
an
hour
after
we
left
our
camp
another
light
appeared
growing
larger
and
larger
it
was
one
of
two
things
either
my
fire
was
not
extinguished
or
a
match
thrown
down
by
one
of
the
others
had
fired
the
deep
dry
grass
i
consoled
myself
that
it
could
not
spread
for
the
sloughs
and
the
barren
soil
would
cut
it
off
i
had
a
grim
satisfaction
when
i
thought
of
the
snakes
and
how
they
would
run
for
the
desert
land
this
was
a
real
guiding
star
growing
larger
and
larger
as
we
were
carried
up
the
stream
i
slept
on
shore
when
the
tide
would
take
us
no
farther
phillipps
got
breakfast
we
were
now
about
three
miles
from
the
slough
after
breakfast
we
alternately
towed
the
boat
for
there
was
no
wind
to
carry
us
up
this
morning
and
two
hours
later
arrived
at
the
diverging
streams
near
by
we
saw
some
mules
showing
evidence
of
having
been
worked
it
was
clear
now
that
the
ranch
was
near
there
was
still
a
chance
that
we
would
take
the
wrong
stream
over
on
the
opposite
side
was
a
tall
cottonwood
tree
this
i
climbed
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
some
kind
of
a
shed
half
a
mile
up
the
east
stream
the
land
between
proved
to
be
a
large
island
as
we
neared
the
building
two
swarthy
men
emerged
and
came
down
to
the
shore
buenos
días
al
called
as
we
pulled
in
to
the
landing
buenos
días
señor
they
answered
with
a
smile
they
were
employees
of
the
rancho
la
bolso
which
was
a
up
the
stream
did
we
make
the
big
fire
which
had
burned
until
morning
our
answer
seemed
to
relieve
their
minds
what
would
we
do
with
our
boat
it
was
theirs
to
do
with
as
they
pleased
leading
two
horses
from
out
of
the
building
they
mounted
and
told
us
to
climb
on
behind
and
away
we
rode
across
some
sloughs
hidden
in
the
trees
we
came
to
the
buildings
three
or
four
adobe
houses
some
little
brown
children
scattered
to
announce
our
coming
as
we
dismounted
two
white
men
approached
why

while
major
powell
was
making
his
second
voyage
of
exploration
another
party
was
toiling
up
these
canyons
towing
their
boats
from
the
precipitous
shores
this
party
was
under
the
leadership
of
lieutenant
wheeler
of
the
army
the
party
was
large
composed
of
twenty
men
including
a
number
of
mojave
indians
in
the
river
expedition
while
others
were
sent
overland
with
supplies
to
the
mouth
of
diamond
creek
by
almost
superhuman
effort
they
succeeded
in
getting
their
boats
up
the
canyon
as
far
as
diamond
creek
while
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
reached
this
point
there
were
times
when
we
could
hardly
believe
it
was
possible
when
we
saw
the
walls
they
would
have
to
climb
in
this
granite
gorge
in
some
places
there
seemed
to
be
no
place
less
than
five
hundred
feet
above
the
river
where
they
could
secure
a
foothold
their
method
was
to
carry
a
rope
over
these
places
then
pull
the
boats
up
through
the
rapids
by
main
force
it
would
be
just
as
easy
to
pull
a
heavy
rowboat
up
the
gorge
of
niagara
as
through
some
of
these
rapids
their
best
plan
by
far
would
have
been
to
haul
their
boats
in
at
diamond
creek
and
make
the
descent
as
they
did
after
reaching
this
point
the
only
advantage
their
method
gave
them
was
a
knowledge
of
what
they
would
meet
with
on
the
downstream
run
lieutenant
wheeler
professed
to
disbelieve
that
major
powell
had
descended
below
diamond
creek
and
called
his
voyage
the
completion
of
the
exploration
of
the
colorado
river
in
a
four
days
run
they
succeeded
in
covering
the
same
distance
that
had
taken
four
weeks
of
endless
toil
to
bring
their
boats
up
to
this
point
